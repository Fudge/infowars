[01:07.840 --> 01:13.640]  communications on Benghazi talking points we've got some clips that were dug
[01:13.640 --> 01:19.000]  up separately from Benghazi on IRS gate whereas I had remembered a year ago they
[01:19.000 --> 01:25.800]  had hearings with the director of the IRS denying that anyone was targeting
[01:25.800 --> 01:29.520]  Tea Party or conservative or Christian groups I mean this has been well known
[01:29.520 --> 01:33.240]  and that was brought up because MSNBC was bragging about it so they've now
[01:33.240 --> 01:37.240]  found those clips and it's in a Mitch McConnell Republican TV ad we're gonna be
[01:37.240 --> 01:40.520]  playing I saw it yesterday meant to get to it we're gonna air it coming up
[01:40.520 --> 01:45.720]  today Bill O'Reilly I mean not only do we have Rachel Maddow coming out and
[01:45.720 --> 01:50.400]  lying and saying that I said that the tornado that killed a bunch of four
[01:50.400 --> 01:56.520]  people good souls up in Oklahoma also Oklahoma City and more she said that I
[01:56.520 --> 02:01.560]  said Obama sent the tornado when a caller asked about it and all I said was
[02:01.560 --> 02:05.680]  the caller is like I think it's weather warfare somebody and more said that and I
[02:05.680 --> 02:09.120]  said well they have that but it's mainly general fronts they can weather
[02:09.120 --> 02:16.520]  weather modify you're in tornado alley this is probably real that then turns
[02:16.520 --> 02:20.400]  into of course we have the full clip and articles that wrote about it that I said
[02:20.400 --> 02:24.360]  he sent a tornado well now Bill O'Reilly agrees that we should shut down
[02:24.360 --> 02:29.280]  people's free speech and that there needs to be mainstream media needs to be
[02:29.280 --> 02:36.960]  protected and have rights but that the alternative media blogs news sites you
[02:36.960 --> 02:41.680]  know anything that isn't CNN or Fox News or MSNBC that it needs to be shut down
[02:41.680 --> 02:47.080]  and that Facebook's doing a good job shutting down hate speech like mothers
[02:47.080 --> 02:52.640]  that post photos of their autistic children at the March on Monsanto we
[02:52.640 --> 02:56.600]  have one of those ladies by the way in studio today she's already out there
[02:56.600 --> 03:02.560]  amazing individual who was actually able to reverse her child's autism with some
[03:02.560 --> 03:07.040]  of the detoxing things that are out there Andrea LaLamas is going to be in
[03:07.040 --> 03:12.480]  studio with a censored by Facebook on record for her evil hate speech of
[03:12.480 --> 03:17.440]  marching on Monsanto with her cute little children that is hate and Miller
[03:17.440 --> 03:21.000]  alley says that's good then we can punch this article up for TV viewers have
[03:21.000 --> 03:28.440]  not good info wars.com Bill O'Reilly smears Alex Jones in hate speech rant and
[03:28.440 --> 03:33.360]  he just says it's time to stop hate speech and flashes up out of context
[03:33.360 --> 03:41.320]  about a seven second rant I was making and then turns my face red so here we
[03:41.320 --> 03:46.360]  are supporting the Justice Department not being able to go after news core and
[03:46.360 --> 03:52.600]  persecute them with blackmail over the phone hacking scandal in England
[03:52.800 --> 03:56.680]  because it's selective enforcement and meant to take down the whole press here
[03:56.680 --> 04:00.520]  I am supporting Rush Limbaugh not being kicked off the air last year with that
[04:00.520 --> 04:04.720]  whole thing of you know saying a woman wants us to pay for her condoms and
[04:04.720 --> 04:11.440]  birth control you know here I am not even agreeing with what he said totally but
[04:11.440 --> 04:15.360]  agree but saying he shouldn't be taking off air and here I am supporting
[04:15.360 --> 04:19.480]  everybody's free speech and then they're trying to get us shot down that's how
[04:19.480 --> 04:25.320]  pathetic these people are I mean Bill O'Reilly knows about the Kennedy
[04:25.320 --> 04:28.680]  assassination he a TV reports about it 20 years ago I know people that know him
[04:28.680 --> 04:36.680]  he was a anti-new order got 20 years ago 15 years ago I remember seeing him on
[04:36.680 --> 04:39.800]  Fox News like 15 years ago about the Illuminati but when he did that whole
[04:39.800 --> 04:44.480]  sexual harassment thing and settled it and you know it would send
[04:44.480 --> 04:47.840]  security after people that called his show that disagreed with him and
[04:47.840 --> 04:54.840]  threatened people I mean he is a authoritarian dirtbag joke who hates
[04:54.840 --> 04:59.440]  freedom and who hates free speech we'll be right back

[08:35.440 --> 08:46.640]  today it is Thursday Thursday the 30th day of May 2013 we are gonna be here
[08:46.640 --> 08:51.320]  live but for the next three hours actually Jessica will be joining us at
[08:51.320 --> 08:57.200]  the bottom of this hour in about 25 minutes she is an info wars auxiliary
[08:57.200 --> 09:01.080]  reporter always has a great job and she videotaped her girlfriend and herself
[09:01.080 --> 09:09.800]  being groped by the TSA and it's been CBS news you name it everywhere but not
[09:09.800 --> 09:13.400]  giving info wars credit for breaking the video which is fine doesn't matter we
[09:13.400 --> 09:18.480]  are still more and more setting the agenda of liberty exposing the tyranny
[09:18.480 --> 09:23.560]  so don't give us credit whatever and it's been in no exaggeration I don't like
[09:23.560 --> 09:27.240]  15 major newspapers but she was interviewed by CNN she was interviewed by a
[09:27.240 --> 09:32.520]  bunch of other TV networks and then our interviews never aired they they covered
[09:32.520 --> 09:35.760]  the event but did the but then the interviews and then never aired her
[09:35.760 --> 09:41.600]  because they couldn't edit what she said out of context that's why they never
[09:41.600 --> 09:45.840]  air my taped interviews because I just say it little info packets I'm much
[09:45.840 --> 09:48.840]  better when I'm on an enemy program because I know I have limited time and
[09:48.840 --> 09:53.040]  it has a way of focusing me and then they can't really edit anything out of
[09:53.040 --> 09:56.240]  context so it makes them angry that's why they come to the radio show like
[09:56.240 --> 10:00.440]  Rachel Maddow and MSNBC and I I could probably sue them I could probably get a
[10:00.440 --> 10:03.520]  judgment even though I'm a public figure but I don't want to do that they
[10:03.520 --> 10:07.840]  already hurt themselves worse than they hurt me if they ever succeed in hurting
[10:07.840 --> 10:11.480]  me I'll probably sue some people because that's when the lawsuits a sure thing
[10:11.480 --> 10:17.360]  you're saying that I said Obama sent a tornado to hit Oklahoma City when a
[10:17.360 --> 10:21.440]  caller said are you know I think it's weather weapons and I said well there
[10:21.440 --> 10:25.200]  are weather weapons that's real but I don't think this is a weather weapon
[10:25.200 --> 10:30.280]  that turned into I said Obama did it which is a pure attempt to not listen
[10:30.280 --> 10:34.320]  to Alex Jones to not have Alex Jones on the radio to not have people come on my
[10:34.320 --> 10:40.880]  show and now Bill O'Reilly has come out and said it's time to shut down hate
[10:40.880 --> 10:45.720]  speech in America and then played a clip of me completely out of context this is
[10:45.720 --> 10:51.680]  a guy who put caller ID on his radio show that was unpopular and failed and if
[10:51.680 --> 10:57.560]  someone disagreed with him he's such a bully punk I like to get in a boxing
[10:57.560 --> 11:02.000]  ring with Bill O'Reilly Bill O'Reilly I challenge you to a pay-per-view boxing
[11:02.000 --> 11:05.640]  match you think you're so tough now your dad was a you know tough Irish cop

[11:30.720 --> 11:34.000]  million viewers you normally have about two million let's pull up his latest
[11:34.000 --> 11:38.080]  ratings they've dropped a lot I mean sure you're you're coming down fast but
[11:38.080 --> 11:42.640]  you're miles above MSNBC and CNN but still I mean you're jealous you your
[11:42.640 --> 11:48.760]  radio show failed you're a failure and I'm gonna get to this the reason he makes
[11:48.760 --> 11:52.000]  me so mad and you know I don't attack other people in media until they attack
[11:52.000 --> 11:56.920]  me and lie about me and he gets up there and agrees we should shut down hate
[11:56.920 --> 12:01.840]  speech which is anybody criticizing the corrupt media and government and all
[12:01.840 --> 12:05.200]  these old fake neocons all these fake conservatives all these fake liberals
[12:05.200 --> 12:09.480]  all these socialists all these authoritarians they're all the dying
[12:09.480 --> 12:14.720]  dinosaur media and a perfect storm with the rotting government their ratings
[12:14.720 --> 12:18.160]  are all dropping our ratings are going up and they know that and they're upset
[12:18.160 --> 12:23.680]  and so they're circling the wagons like like you know what's circling the
[12:23.680 --> 12:30.120]  toilet bowl like Carl Rove third blossom circling the toilet bowl they are I
[12:30.120 --> 12:33.360]  mean you got Carl Rove attacking the alternative media and the Tea Party and
[12:33.360 --> 12:40.160]  and Rand Paul and and Ted Cruz because we're the future you're the past you've
[12:40.160 --> 12:45.160]  got the entire hit parade of neocons attacking Matt drudge and drudge report
[12:45.160 --> 12:50.080]  calm because Matt drudge it was the past the present and the future because he
[12:50.080 --> 12:56.720]  likes liberty he likes the truth he likes the racy reality of standing up to
[12:56.720 --> 13:02.760]  tyranny he's the future he's independent you're the past I'm independent I'm the
[13:02.760 --> 13:08.240]  future you're the past the wave of the future and you know we're the wave of
[13:08.240 --> 13:15.160]  the future and you don't like the wave of the future you know you're stayed in a
[13:15.160 --> 13:20.160]  joke I mean somebody calls in and attacks me and says I disagree with you I
[13:20.160 --> 13:24.720]  don't run and try to hook up caller ID and then and then have private
[13:24.720 --> 13:30.240]  security go to the person's house I don't sit here and get female employees at

[13:46.080 --> 13:51.560]  punk you think you can shove me around you're a coward and that's why you'll

[13:57.200 --> 14:02.080]  you want to use me as the poster boy of your censorship of your attempt to
[14:02.080 --> 14:06.440]  extinguish the fire of liberty thank you for throwing me in that briar patch pal

[15:19.520 --> 15:23.720]  if he just occasionally placed clips out of context he'll inoculate his
[15:23.720 --> 15:28.960]  audience into disliking us when all you did was send your moderately sized
[15:28.960 --> 15:33.320]  audience over to us bill and by the way some of the liberal sites posted it and
[15:33.320 --> 15:38.360]  that most the conservatives and the liberals and libertarians when I was

[18:33.240 --> 18:36.560]  better than his old buddy O'Reilly these two are supposedly best buddies I've
[18:36.560 --> 18:40.560]  seen back back on O'Reilly a few months ago and I was being mean to him and Beck
[18:40.560 --> 18:45.000]  was turning red and laughing back at him I mean these guys aren't even nice to
[18:45.000 --> 18:48.520]  each other how could you travel all over the country with somebody say your
[18:48.520 --> 18:52.080]  great buddies with them and then sit there and snipe at each other because
[18:52.080 --> 18:56.680]  Fox and News Corp ordered them to against one but it just they have no honor
[18:56.680 --> 19:01.440]  there is no honor among thieves as it said and they're trying to steal your
[19:01.440 --> 19:06.280]  mind they're trying to steal a real restoration a revolution against tyranny

[19:47.600 --> 19:52.440]  future together and that's why they're scared because we carry the light of

[23:04.960 --> 23:10.200]  look for houses that appear to be easy targets but fake TV can fool even
[23:10.200 --> 23:14.280]  professional burglars into thinking someone is home watching television. As a
[23:14.280 --> 23:19.000]  recent widow living alone it gives me great peace of mind to set my fake TV
[23:19.000 --> 23:23.080]  near a window and know that passing motors and pedestrians will think someone
[23:23.080 --> 23:28.600]  is home watching TV when I'm actually away from home. Fake TV easily plugs into
[23:28.600 --> 23:33.200]  any outlet just like a light on a timer and they're so easy to use you just
[23:33.200 --> 23:36.720]  plug them in and they're ready to go plus they're so affordable that we have

[24:21.120 --> 24:31.760]  force down here to try to intimidate me hate speech huh punk till they got a hold
[24:31.760 --> 24:39.480]  of me I used to help little old ladies across the street I used to help the
[24:39.480 --> 24:50.440]  blind to see oh yeah cuz I read the papers they won't be seen with me
[24:52.560 --> 25:04.160]  he learned me no more no more hey look at this government orders midwives
[25:04.160 --> 25:08.920]  to spy on racist parents you've heard over in England and Europe they're
[25:08.920 --> 25:12.200]  saying everyone will have a social worker assigned everyone that's in your
[25:12.200 --> 25:16.840]  life spying on you and if you don't want totally open borders and and don't
[25:16.840 --> 25:19.800]  say that because racism is only by white people that white people are
[25:19.800 --> 25:25.000]  inherently bad then you will have your kids taken from you that's a new
[25:25.000 --> 25:29.440]  breaking info wars.com story by Paul Joseph Watson that's coming up let me
[25:29.440 --> 25:34.360]  get to this right now because this is breaking Newsmax got the interview how
[25:34.360 --> 25:39.920]  judiciary chairman the Newsmax holder should resign here's that clip many
[25:39.920 --> 25:45.040]  Republicans have called for Eric Holders resignation should he resign well
[25:45.040 --> 25:50.160]  last year in the last Congress I co-sponsored a resolution calling for
[25:50.160 --> 25:57.840]  him to step down and he has still not complied with the subpoena that was
[25:57.840 --> 26:02.320]  given to him with regard to the investigation of fast and furious and
[26:02.320 --> 26:09.200]  the result of that is that his non-compliance his having been held in
[26:09.200 --> 26:14.680]  contempt of the House of Representatives all indicates to me his
[26:14.680 --> 26:19.520]  unwillingness to take responsibility for the actions in the Justice Department
[26:19.520 --> 26:24.160]  his inability to provide leadership and therefore he's provided leadership
[26:24.160 --> 26:28.080]  all right that's enough all right that's a speech we should let him run fast
[26:28.080 --> 26:31.720]  and furious we should let him fund Al Qaeda you know we should let him do all
[26:31.720 --> 26:36.000]  this stuff I mean leave the president alone that's hate speech that's what
[26:36.000 --> 26:39.240]  the Soviet Union developed hate speech where you're shut down and then basically
[26:39.240 --> 26:42.760]  once you're silenced arrested for criticizing the government or any other
[26:42.760 --> 26:46.040]  corrupt group and Villa Raleigh thinks that's a great idea I think that is very
[26:46.040 --> 26:50.560]  offensive so there goes some hate speech right there now let's go to this
[26:50.560 --> 26:55.840]  Nixon and Obama this article is Nick's Obama upon info wars.com here are the
[26:55.840 --> 27:02.160]  comparisons of Obama and Nixon now let's go ahead and play that I have to
[27:02.160 --> 27:07.200]  tell you that is exactly the approach that the Nixon administration took.
[27:07.200 --> 27:14.800]  Interesting I first learned from news reports I first learned about it from
[27:14.800 --> 27:19.520]  the same news reports that I think most people learned about this the comments
[27:19.520 --> 27:25.280]  I made during this period the comments made by my press secretary in my
[27:25.280 --> 27:32.160]  behalf were based on the information provided to us at the time we made those
[27:32.160 --> 27:37.320]  comments. Keep in mind by the way these so-called talking points that were
[27:37.320 --> 27:42.360]  prepared pretty much matched the assessments that I was receiving at that
[27:42.360 --> 27:48.920]  time and had we not had that kind of security and that kind of secrecy that
[27:48.920 --> 27:55.320]  allowed for the kind of exchange that is essential. Leaks related to national
[27:55.320 --> 28:04.480]  security can put people at risk. I must now turn my full intention and I shall
[28:04.480 --> 28:13.520]  do so once again for the larger duties of this office. Others may get
[28:13.520 --> 28:18.480]  distracted by chasing every fleeting issue that passes by but the middle
[28:18.480 --> 28:22.320]  class will always be my number one focus. Yeah well you're trying to destroy them.
[28:22.320 --> 28:27.400]  There is one last line that President Obama hasn't used yet and that's in any
[28:27.400 --> 28:34.280]  organization a man at the top must bear the responsibility. That
[28:34.280 --> 28:43.920]  responsibility therefore forms here in this office. I accept it. I am not a crook.
[28:43.920 --> 28:50.360]  Yeah that's revealing politics doing a great job. All right there you go ladies
[28:50.360 --> 28:53.560]  and gentlemen and that's why the system fears the alternative media because
[28:53.560 --> 28:57.200]  we'll just show you how both parties are corrupt out of control and we're just
[28:57.200 --> 29:00.960]  looking for a few good men and women who care about their children's future in
[29:00.960 --> 29:05.840]  government in corporations in life to leave the way out of this corrupt
[29:05.840 --> 29:10.880]  morass that we've entered. Now when we come back we've got one more clip this is
[29:10.880 --> 29:17.320]  a man to answer is put out by Mitch McConnell the leader of the Republicans
[29:17.320 --> 29:23.560]  in the Senate and then I am the Senate. Obama would have us believe but he is
[29:23.560 --> 29:29.160]  not all powerful and Obama is the nastiest expression of globalist
[29:29.160 --> 29:32.200]  tyranny I've ever seen because of the season we're in but even though he's a
[29:32.200 --> 29:39.760]  power puppet he must be politically destroyed. He must be politically
[29:39.760 --> 29:46.000]  annihilated to punish all these other crooks so that they fear the people and
[29:46.000 --> 29:54.680]  they fear justice. We're on the march the Empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the

[35:10.920 --> 35:16.080]  intimidation will then actually backfire so that's coming up but here is Mitch
[35:16.080 --> 35:19.920]  mcconnell again I don't fantasize that Mitch mcconnell is gonna save us
[35:19.920 --> 35:25.160]  hell Mitch mcconnell tried to beat Rand Paul with a Republican money and
[35:25.160 --> 35:30.200]  favored the banker-funded candidate in the Kentucky primary a few years ago but
[35:30.200 --> 35:38.280]  Rand beat him despite the Republican machine and Rand basically talked to him
[35:38.280 --> 35:42.240]  behind the scenes I'll just leave it at that and said look you're not going to
[35:42.240 --> 35:45.960]  stop a freedom movement in this country and the only hope the Republicans have
[35:45.960 --> 35:51.240]  is to stop being such complete sellouts and Rand Paul has actually
[35:51.240 --> 35:56.360]  infiltrated them they've not infiltrated him and I've been told it's the same
[35:56.360 --> 36:00.440]  thing with Ted Cruz that has yet to be seen I'm starting to believe it and when
[36:00.440 --> 36:03.840]  I found his people just can't believe we can win they can't believe we could
[36:03.840 --> 36:08.640]  reverse things well my ancestors all they did was win or they died trying and
[36:08.640 --> 36:12.240]  I'm tired of this loser idea that we don't have any power and a bunch of
[36:12.240 --> 36:15.280]  globalist scum are better than us just because they've got the money they've
[36:15.280 --> 36:18.760]  got the money through fraud and they want to get rid of the free market and
[36:18.760 --> 36:25.240]  are ladder out of this so that they're up there and we're down here uh-uh I want
[36:25.240 --> 36:28.800]  to empower all of humanity so that's coming up but mirrors Mitch McConnell
[36:28.800 --> 36:34.080]  being forced to say demand answers so they get the political support to impeach
[36:34.080 --> 36:39.280]  and prosecute I'm telling you folks people now know that the IRS is a
[36:39.280 --> 36:43.000]  collection agency for the fellow reserve people now know that the ultra rich are
[36:43.000 --> 36:48.560]  all exempt it's the end of these people if you want it if you believe it if you
[36:48.560 --> 36:51.640]  decide you have power I know why the yuppies aside they don't have power and
[36:51.640 --> 36:56.560]  it's kind of laying the ditch because they don't believe you can do anything
[36:56.560 --> 37:00.720]  they have low esteem for themselves so they just say I'm just gonna enjoy life
[37:00.720 --> 37:07.880]  eat drink and be merry for tomorrow we die no how about educate yourself get
[37:07.880 --> 37:11.920]  informed get involved the animating contest of liberty is the stairway to
[37:11.920 --> 37:17.760]  the stars and then eat drink and be merry and you're off time work hard play
[37:17.760 --> 37:22.720]  hard win-win-win you're not happy because you're jellyfish you're not happy
[37:22.720 --> 37:28.080]  because you're seething with weakness instead of seething with power and I
[37:28.080 --> 37:36.160]  mean love and goodness and also a healthy dose of a little crazed that's
[37:36.160 --> 37:39.920]  what it is to be human that's why they want you dumbed down and sedate because
[37:39.920 --> 37:44.360]  they know our natural order and they sure know the people that colonize this
[37:44.360 --> 37:49.880]  country were some of the most crazed wild-eyed intelligent free people out
[37:49.880 --> 37:56.560]  there the globalist fancy themselves as cultured wild men they are not they are
[37:56.560 --> 38:04.880]  cultured scum in a culture of sess we are the future but we the people that
[38:04.880 --> 38:10.520]  have empathy and care and who have goodwill we must also tune into our
[38:10.520 --> 38:17.280]  resistance side and our animal war side to wage war with information and with
[38:17.280 --> 38:22.680]  focus and intellect but with an over-driving electrical charge of
[38:22.680 --> 38:30.960]  annihilation against the enemy crush them crush them and I mean that's all
[38:30.960 --> 38:36.120]  you've got to do is decide you are the future I just I'm just sick of all this
[38:36.120 --> 38:39.800]  scum sucking off of us and then telling us it's a favor because they can't
[38:39.800 --> 38:42.640]  believe they've gotten away with all this they're scared of us and they want
[38:42.640 --> 38:45.960]  to stick their hands down our pants to break our will we're going to our guest
[38:45.960 --> 38:48.600]  here in a moment she's got a split in about 20 minutes ago to her college
[38:48.600 --> 38:54.240]  class but right now let's go ahead and go to Mitch McConnell this is the type of
[38:54.240 --> 38:57.760]  TV ad we need to see this is the type of stuff that will defeat the
[38:57.760 --> 39:01.400]  collectivist if we don't defeat them they're going to use their mass of
[39:01.400 --> 39:06.360]  dumbed-down serfs to take our guns our property our children everything they
[39:06.360 --> 39:11.040]  hate those of us that are successful the minions of the globalist and the
[39:11.040 --> 39:14.640]  globalist themselves we're stuck between corrupt elites that are threatened by
[39:14.640 --> 39:19.200]  goodness and beauty and honor and strength and real power and giant masses
[39:19.200 --> 39:23.840]  of thumb-sucking scum who are victims and handicapped basically that I want to
[39:23.840 --> 39:28.080]  empower but we may not be able to empower them so we've got to take over the
[39:28.080 --> 39:33.680]  system now you either take the system back or we're slaves and I am not
[39:33.680 --> 39:39.160]  getting on my knees to suck the boots of lesser men you understand that I want
[39:39.160 --> 39:43.520]  to be able to be in a free society and be involved in free expression and free
[39:43.520 --> 39:48.240]  society and hang around who I want and live where I want and do what I want
[39:48.240 --> 39:53.720]  and worship what I want and build what I want and not have a bunch of scum on my
[39:53.720 --> 39:57.520]  back let's go to this clip and then we'll
[39:57.520 --> 40:02.560]  go to our guest here from Republican leader of the US Senate Mitch McConnell
[40:02.560 --> 40:07.000]  again and again this administration and its allies have used the resources of
[40:07.000 --> 40:13.160]  the government itself to intimidate or silence those who question or oppose it
[40:13.160 --> 40:17.360]  I don't know about you but I think that the leader of the free world and his
[40:17.360 --> 40:22.160]  advisors have better things to do than dig through other people's tax return a
[40:22.160 --> 40:25.680]  number of Tea Party groups had complained and said a Republican leader
[40:25.680 --> 40:29.240]  Mitch McConnell wrote to the IRS to complain that they were being harassed
[40:29.240 --> 40:35.160]  there's absolutely no target here dozens of Tea Party affiliated groups
[40:35.160 --> 40:38.480]  across the country learned what it was like to draw the attention of the
[40:38.480 --> 40:42.880]  speech police when they received a lengthy questionnaire from the IRS
[40:42.880 --> 40:48.240]  demanding listen to this demanding attendance lists meetings transcripts
[40:48.240 --> 40:52.760]  and donor information what they're trying to do is intimidate donors to
[40:52.760 --> 40:56.840]  outside groups that are critical of the administration they've got the IRS the
[40:56.840 --> 41:03.160]  SEC and other agencies going after contributors the Internal Revenue
[41:03.160 --> 41:07.960]  Service admitted today that some of its employees targeted conservative
[41:07.960 --> 41:12.840]  political group this is outrageous I told you this years ago folks it's
[41:12.840 --> 41:18.640]  mostly conspiracy there's the Internal Revenue Service to target there is a culture of intimidation
[41:18.640 --> 41:22.680]  throughout the administration IRS began singling out Tea Party you have any kind
[41:22.680 --> 41:26.400]  of conservative leaning background affiliation they're going to target you
[41:26.400 --> 41:30.320]  and come after you this is a spectacular they take their kids this still arrest
[41:30.320 --> 41:33.720]  homeschoolers the things that drive the Obama economy and they drive an
[41:33.720 --> 41:40.800]  ideological agenda that as we have seen again and again has little regard for
[41:40.800 --> 41:45.400]  those who dissent no president from either party is more powerful than the
[41:45.400 --> 41:51.400]  Constitution of the United States today both the Fifth Amendment right refused
[41:51.400 --> 41:54.840]  to answer questions I will not answer any questions or testify about the subject
[41:54.840 --> 41:58.800]  matter of this committee's meeting didn't know at that time I'm not aware of that
[41:58.800 --> 42:03.080]  I don't know I don't know I have no memory of anyone doing that I didn't know
[42:03.080 --> 42:08.440]  that I'm not personally responsible do you believe it is illegal I don't believe
[42:08.440 --> 42:12.080]  it is but when the president does it that means that it is not illegal what
[42:12.080 --> 42:14.800]  does the president believe is the president believes that would be illegal the
[42:14.800 --> 42:21.880]  wall here with the laws irrelevant the law is irrelevant intimidation
[42:21.880 --> 42:27.880]  retaliation secretive our enemies and we're gonna reward our friends yeah we'll
[42:27.880 --> 42:32.520]  go after enemies reward our friends all right ladies and gentlemen here's the
[42:32.520 --> 42:36.280]  issue if the Republicans actually burn Obama for this it will set a precedent
[42:36.280 --> 42:39.240]  where they can't get away with it I got to say Republicans don't usually use the
[42:39.240 --> 42:44.760]  IRS against people since Nixon and that was about a hundred enemies the folks
[42:44.760 --> 42:49.400]  everyone I know that's a pro-lifer pastor even people that are pro-government
[42:49.400 --> 42:53.240]  get audited and told watch what you say and we'll leave you alone to scare
[42:53.240 --> 42:58.040]  people this is the essence of oppression some of those IRS people including the
[42:58.040 --> 43:01.480]  IRS director you know Aaron Dyches and the crew went out a few years ago when
[43:01.480 --> 43:04.480]  they did a press conference and they intimidated them and tried to send police
[43:04.480 --> 43:08.720]  after them for asking questions about the Federal Reserve being private these
[43:08.720 --> 43:12.760]  are people that bug their eyes out at you and try to have men in black intimidate
[43:12.760 --> 43:17.920]  you because they know what they're doing is wrong and that's what the TSA is all
[43:17.920 --> 43:22.480]  about our government publicly runs Al Qaeda in Libya and Syria now that's on
[43:22.480 --> 43:28.320]  record and finally you know Rand Paul's talking about it saying why are we
[43:28.320 --> 43:33.160]  funding Al Qaeda and then when you go to the airport they single out I've seen
[43:33.160 --> 43:37.600]  it attractive women especially or of its guys that are you know walking around
[43:37.600 --> 43:41.400]  Nelly as it gets you know they see guys they like they single you out and they
[43:41.400 --> 43:46.480]  literally salivate when they do this now others don't like doing it but it's
[43:46.480 --> 43:51.280]  quote their job they'll do fake patdowns I've seen it done I've had it in my crew
[43:51.280 --> 43:54.840]  where they act like they're touching you and going I don't like doing this they
[43:54.840 --> 43:58.240]  actually talk under their breath like ventriloquist I hear you I don't like
[43:58.240 --> 44:02.280]  this I'm a listener it's just a good-paying job we want to unionize we
[44:02.280 --> 44:06.040]  don't want to have to do this I've been told that scores of times but but
[44:06.040 --> 44:11.160]  doesn't matter the supervisors are the ones that get off on it and her story
[44:11.160 --> 44:16.160]  from info wars.com went viral dozens of newspapers picked it up anti TSA
[44:16.160 --> 44:21.880]  activists TSA agent grope my vagina is the headline woman complains of sexual
[44:21.880 --> 44:34.440]  molestation after frothing TSA opt-out protest after fronting TSA opt-out
[44:34.440 --> 44:41.040]  protest but the point is an activist who I guess Watson wrote this I guess it's a
[44:41.040 --> 44:45.040]  British way to say it an activist who fronted a national TSA kind of led a
[44:45.040 --> 44:51.000]  national TSA opt-out campaign last year has released a video of a patdown during
[44:51.000 --> 44:58.480]  which she accused the TSA agent of touching her and now that video has gone
[44:58.480 --> 45:03.560]  viral and has been picked up again by New York Daily News the Daily Mail you
[45:03.560 --> 45:07.720]  name it but she was then interviewed by several TV networks and it never aired
[45:07.720 --> 45:11.560]  and the point is is if they can take your kids to a private room or take your
[45:11.560 --> 45:16.440]  kids and pull their shirt off or grab their groin or even go in your pants and
[45:16.440 --> 45:21.400]  then deny it or then say it's okay and then Texas tries to pass a law saying
[45:21.400 --> 45:27.480]  you can't do it I've been post covered it Ashley Jessica student activist says
[45:27.480 --> 45:31.800]  she was violated during TSA pat down the video they all picked it up and then if
[45:31.800 --> 45:35.120]  they can normalize this they can get away with it anywhere the highways the
[45:35.120 --> 45:39.320]  roads you name it and it's now starting it's about government treating you that
[45:39.320 --> 45:43.440]  you're all suspects you're all criminals this is what prisoners have to be
[45:43.440 --> 45:47.560]  groped like this in medium and maximum security prisons so this is turning
[45:47.560 --> 45:51.560]  everything into a giant prison with Walmart telescreen saying saying watch
[45:51.560 --> 45:55.760]  your neighbors and so we take you now to Ashley Jessica Ashley thanks for coming
[45:55.760 --> 46:00.320]  on with us what do you make of this becoming a big story and then what do
[46:00.320 --> 46:04.800]  you make of CNN and others interviewing you but not airing it I'm
[46:04.800 --> 46:08.440]  completely in shock that this has become such a big story because of all of the
[46:08.440 --> 46:12.560]  other abuses that the TSA has engaged in over the past few years you know where
[46:12.560 --> 46:18.120]  was the mainstream media coverage when the TSA was humiliating cancer survivors
[46:18.120 --> 46:24.800]  or exposing people's breasts or you know puncturing people's your ostomy bags
[46:24.800 --> 46:29.480]  like why wasn't that completely blown up in the media I feel like they are
[46:29.480 --> 46:33.280]  latching on to this they're trying to make it seem like I've blown everything
[46:33.280 --> 46:38.080]  out of proportion they're overstating the claims that I have made about this all
[46:38.080 --> 46:43.200]  I said was that she touched my vagina you can clearly see her hands make contact
[46:43.200 --> 46:48.080]  with that area in the video after she does it she says I'm gonna explain to
[46:48.080 --> 46:52.440]  you what I'm gonna do I'm gonna go all the way up your leg until my hand meets
[46:52.440 --> 46:57.800]  resistance it's going to hit first and then come back down she's very vocal
[46:57.800 --> 47:04.560]  about what she's gonna do basically this is a a pat down that happens quite
[47:04.560 --> 47:08.880]  frequently this isn't anything out of the ordinary I've witnessed I've witnessed
[47:08.880 --> 47:14.320]  people grab you know Jesse Ventura's genitals and then and then even what
[47:14.320 --> 47:19.760]  really made it mad was go back you know into his gluteus maximus and people say
[47:19.760 --> 47:24.360]  oh you ought to pay for that it is a violation if somebody did this to you in
[47:24.360 --> 47:28.320]  a park they get 15 years in prison but they're doing it to make sure there's
[47:28.320 --> 47:34.160]  not a bin Laden in your pants exactly Ashley is bin Laden hiding in your
[47:34.160 --> 47:39.360]  underwear no he is not they actually didn't find him during the search
[47:39.360 --> 47:44.640]  shockingly enough well every criminal says they're innocent right and they
[47:44.640 --> 47:50.040]  haven't found any weapons in women's underwear or anyone's underwear for that
[47:50.040 --> 47:55.360]  matter with all of these broke downs and all of the enhanced security that's
[47:55.360 --> 47:58.960]  been implemented have you ever gone through it where they're clearly enjoying
[47:58.960 --> 48:05.400]  it last year in Virginia I had a TSA agent who ordered me around like a
[48:05.400 --> 48:11.280]  prisoner it seemed like she was enjoying the power of it all she was the one who
[48:11.280 --> 48:16.800]  told me she's gonna touch my behind over and over again until I don't flinch I
[48:16.800 --> 48:23.080]  know it's bizarre I mean I had a guy pat me down and I mean he was just ready to
[48:23.080 --> 48:28.520]  go I mean it was a smacking talking to me in my purring voice and I was just
[48:28.520 --> 48:34.040]  like this is beyond bizarre I mean it's incredible it is and I mean these TSA
[48:34.040 --> 48:39.240]  agents they were polite but she still touched my vagina with her hand so
[48:39.240 --> 48:43.000]  people some people are saying oh you know they were polite you're making too
[48:43.000 --> 48:47.480]  big a deal of it I don't care how polite you are that is a violation miss USA
[48:47.480 --> 48:51.200]  said they went in her pants and in her body and broke down crying they've had
[48:51.200 --> 48:54.440]  airline piles till they revolted and said we were allowed to fly the plane we're
[48:54.440 --> 48:58.000]  gonna do this to us you know their union said no so they quit they had guys
[48:58.000 --> 49:02.440]  going having to go home and having to vomit because it is this is a form of
[49:02.440 --> 49:07.920]  rape that's what it is it's completely out of control I'm I'm in shock that
[49:07.920 --> 49:12.200]  this is considered normal to even have to be searched for any if innocent people
[49:12.200 --> 49:15.360]  are being searched without probable cause and we've headed into tyranny well
[49:15.360 --> 49:18.320]  listen Jesse Ventura is a really nice I've got to know him really well but
[49:18.320 --> 49:22.080]  really aggressive guy and you know a normal aggressive guy is not gonna have
[49:22.080 --> 49:28.080]  some man putting his hand up and enter is like I'm leaving I'm leaving this
[49:28.080 --> 49:33.880]  country is Germany because it's normal to not want someone to to literally go
[49:33.880 --> 49:37.040]  in between your butt cheeks I mean I'm sorry I have to talk like this but it's
[49:37.040 --> 49:41.960]  weird I mean it's it's weird it's bizarre I mean I've been getting so much
[49:41.960 --> 49:46.400]  support and so many people thanking me for doing this but other people are
[49:46.400 --> 49:51.160]  saying because I was filming the Pat down I was instigating it I was looking
[49:51.160 --> 49:54.640]  for trouble which is completely not true it's a good thing you were wearing
[49:54.640 --> 49:57.120]  baggy pants if you're wearing a skirt they would have said you were asking to
[49:57.120 --> 50:02.760]  be raped I mean yeah people have said things like that before don't wear
[50:02.760 --> 50:06.960]  lipstick honey you're the one asking for it exactly saying I'm asking for
[50:06.960 --> 50:11.440]  attention by this no I had my camera rolling because last year in Virginia as
[50:11.440 --> 50:15.520]  soon as my brother turned on his camera everything changed I was given a very
[50:15.520 --> 50:19.840]  respectful pat down on camera in which she didn't even come near my private
[50:19.840 --> 50:26.280]  parts and she said when we opted out she said I just have to let you know that
[50:26.280 --> 50:30.040]  you're gonna be given an extensive pat down and I'm gonna have to go all the

[54:27.520 --> 54:31.360]  person that needs to be censored number one because I'm I'm angry I'm angry
[54:31.360 --> 54:35.080]  about all this corruption I'm trying to get people motivated that's just
[54:35.080 --> 54:42.080]  terrible we should only watch MSNBC and Miller Riley that's right and Mary
[54:42.080 --> 54:46.280]  Rachel Maddow and Miller Riley they're all attacking they've got Bloomberg AP
[54:46.280 --> 54:55.400]  Reuters not even so much Esquire that I don't know they've done that GQ man I'm
[54:55.400 --> 54:58.320]  getting called by all sorts of people that have known me over the decades when
[54:58.320 --> 55:01.560]  I'm getting all these media calls I mean they're like dig something up and I have
[55:01.560 --> 55:05.000]  nothing to be ashamed of folks whatever they dig up if they spin it or whatever
[55:05.000 --> 55:08.840]  it's it's not true or it's exaggerated but I sit there and think what have I
[55:08.840 --> 55:13.400]  done what's wrong and I'm like it's the opposite of people knew my past my
[55:13.400 --> 55:16.480]  history it sounds like a movie and so it's like well they're just gonna
[55:16.480 --> 55:23.480]  discover anyways the point is is that the new magazine is out and I'm gonna
[55:23.480 --> 55:27.120]  cover it in the next hour for TV viewers and radio listeners but it's the
[55:27.120 --> 55:32.040]  double cover Bilderberg edition you can see the cover at infowarstore.com
[55:32.040 --> 55:37.080]  with the head of Google on the cover that's all I'm gonna say I'm leaving it
[55:37.080 --> 55:40.600]  that going back to somebody who I just love the work she's been doing on so
[55:40.600 --> 55:44.640]  many issues Ashley Jessica has helped lead the national opt-out demonstrations
[55:44.640 --> 55:49.160]  the last few years put Watson means by fronting in his headline fronting the
[55:49.160 --> 55:53.120]  national opt-out and if they can get away with the TS said they can get away
[55:53.120 --> 55:56.120]  with anything now and now actually I've been throwing out some of the points
[55:56.120 --> 56:01.520]  here your YouTube is youtube.com forward slash user forward slash miss Ashley
[56:01.520 --> 56:07.480]  Jessica and your Twitter is Ashley Jessica so Twitter.com forward slash
[56:07.480 --> 56:11.440]  Ashley Jessica but but what are points you think are important to get across
[56:11.440 --> 56:16.480]  here first of all one one thing I want to say is that you know sometimes they
[56:16.480 --> 56:20.480]  only just have the metal detector line open and they shuffle people through
[56:20.480 --> 56:24.840]  that people go through you know no problems and then suddenly they decide
[56:24.840 --> 56:28.240]  certain people need to go through the scanner and if they don't go through the
[56:28.240 --> 56:31.560]  scanner or get patted down they are suddenly a security risk it's a
[56:31.560 --> 56:36.160]  completely arbitrary process it's nothing more than security theater it's just
[56:36.160 --> 56:41.800]  completely out of control I just the main point is that we cannot normalize
[56:41.800 --> 56:46.360]  this type of treatment there is no excuse for people to be putting their
[56:46.360 --> 56:51.080]  hands anywhere near someone's private areas in the name of protecting national
[56:51.080 --> 56:56.200]  security well it makes you all guilty now again it's prisoner training and the
[56:56.200 --> 57:00.480]  government runs al-qaeda now you know I'm thinking about a national
[57:00.480 --> 57:04.680]  demonstration with a fact sheet with mainstream headlines about the government
[57:04.680 --> 57:10.360]  funding al-qaeda running al-qaeda protecting al-qaeda so that was in the
[57:10.360 --> 57:14.600]  hand those out at the airports like you've done you've led protest handing
[57:14.600 --> 57:18.600]  on info at the airport exactly I handed out flyers about the health risks
[57:18.600 --> 57:23.000]  associated with the body scanners some people think now that because the back
[57:23.000 --> 57:26.280]  scatter scanners are going to be phased out that the millimeter scanners are
[57:26.280 --> 57:30.440]  safe and the TSA tells everyone she told me she's required to tell me that it
[57:30.440 --> 57:34.880]  gives off less radiation than a cell phone but in fact it has never been
[57:34.880 --> 57:39.160]  independently certified as safe for anybody and the independent research
[57:39.160 --> 57:45.080]  shows that the the terror hurts radio waves can unzip DNA so that doesn't
[57:45.080 --> 57:48.680]  sound too comforting to me I don't want it I don't want a chance going through
[57:48.680 --> 57:52.360]  that and again remember four years ago when I started really focusing on this
[57:52.360 --> 57:56.080]  and drudge started posting the articles almost every week or sometimes every day
[57:56.080 --> 58:01.000]  and it became a big national story they would say we're not groping anybody we
[58:01.000 --> 58:04.320]  don't take old people in private rooms and strip them we don't make old people
[58:04.320 --> 58:07.760]  get out of wheelchairs that can't walk and then in which video after video
[58:07.760 --> 58:13.800]  showing how they're liars it is a criminal takeover yeah and I get emails
[58:13.800 --> 58:17.760]  from people who are rape survivors telling me that they're afraid to go to
[58:17.760 --> 58:21.560]  the airport because they don't want to be touched like that imagine how
[58:21.560 --> 58:25.200]  triggering and retraumatizing that can be for someone who is a victim of sexual
[58:25.200 --> 58:28.320]  assault they've had top psychologists say it's training little kids to be
[58:28.320 --> 58:32.760]  touched you teach them don't touch you unless it's a perv in a uniform and
[58:32.760 --> 58:36.840]  there's the videos of them stripping little kids going in babies diapers this
[58:36.840 --> 58:40.800]  is a joke this is over the top
[58:42.360 --> 58:48.840]  this is GCN the Genesis Communications radio network

[01:00:17.600 --> 01:00:26.080]  live from Austin Texas Alex Jones all right have you just joined us we're into
[01:00:26.080 --> 01:00:30.080]  the second hour Ashley Jessica there's just some auxiliary reporting for info
[01:00:30.080 --> 01:00:33.680]  wars.com she's gonna be at Goldberg this year she's led national opt out
[01:00:33.680 --> 01:00:37.800]  demonstrations handed out radiation warning info to people at the airports
[01:00:37.800 --> 01:00:45.040]  done just a great job across the board and she got groped her and her friend at
[01:00:45.040 --> 01:00:48.960]  the Atlanta airport and videotaped it and she's not supposed to videotape that
[01:00:48.960 --> 01:00:52.320]  you know that that shows that you know how dare her not want to have her
[01:00:52.320 --> 01:00:55.800]  private parts touched and this is all part of you know dominating the public
[01:00:55.800 --> 01:00:59.760]  but get into the media that did interview you this has become a national
[01:00:59.760 --> 01:01:05.000]  story it's been over 15 papers but but you talk to see it in others and they
[01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:10.520]  never aired the interviews no well I talked to CNN base they were doing a
[01:01:10.520 --> 01:01:14.240]  phone type of interview they were taking notes on what I was saying and then I
[01:01:14.240 --> 01:01:18.920]  started telling them the facts about the body scanners and how the TSA has never
[01:01:18.920 --> 01:01:22.360]  got a terrorist you know just laying out all the facts and then they said to me
[01:01:22.360 --> 01:01:25.760]  they weren't sure if they were gonna use the story anymore because they had
[01:01:25.760 --> 01:01:32.720]  extreme weather that came up that they need to report on I don't know they
[01:01:32.720 --> 01:01:35.720]  always say something else happened like how when they're having the IRS hearings
[01:01:35.720 --> 01:01:39.200]  they cut to a video from the day before the Anderson Cooper talking about gangs
[01:01:39.200 --> 01:01:45.360]  and as Watson was telling me about all this you also you also got interviewed
[01:01:45.360 --> 01:01:49.160]  by some other national TV yeah I was interviewed by Inside Edition I did a
[01:01:49.160 --> 01:01:54.920]  Skype interview with them but it never aired I was saying in the Skype interview
[01:01:54.920 --> 01:01:58.080]  I said you know we all need to opt out of the body scanner we all need to film
[01:01:58.080 --> 01:02:03.120]  our pat downs and hold the TSA accountable and reassert our rights that
[01:02:03.120 --> 01:02:07.320]  was one of the main points that I had said in that interview well look the
[01:02:07.320 --> 01:02:10.640]  good news is you did video tape but so now there's exposure on it because they
[01:02:10.640 --> 01:02:13.520]  don't want this even discussed I mean as I said before went to break remember
[01:02:13.520 --> 01:02:17.080]  four years ago three years ago even two years ago they would deny any of this
[01:02:17.080 --> 01:02:22.080]  was even going on exactly and now people are saying like you know the trolls
[01:02:22.080 --> 01:02:26.640]  they're saying like no you you know this is for our safety this is normal now
[01:02:26.640 --> 01:02:32.520]  you you have to get your privates touch well it's obvious I mean a lot of the
[01:02:32.520 --> 01:02:36.920]  trolls are just government paid minions or their people so invested in the
[01:02:36.920 --> 01:02:42.520]  system they're gonna make excuses no matter what happens exactly but good
[01:02:42.520 --> 01:02:49.280]  thing the Liberty lovers are supporting and bringing attention to this and you
[01:02:49.280 --> 01:02:53.760]  know there's been a back-and-forth in the comments on my on my video lots of
[01:02:53.760 --> 01:02:59.520]  info or supporters you know laying down the facts and exposing everything so
[01:02:59.520 --> 01:03:04.680]  that's great I mean there she went on the video pal right up there in the junk
[01:03:04.680 --> 01:03:09.600]  and I mean look I mean even with your wife or your girlfriend if they're you
[01:03:09.600 --> 01:03:12.600]  know they're not in the mood and you just reach over and grab them they're not
[01:03:12.600 --> 01:03:16.280]  gonna like it I mean this is a stranger doing it how have we gotten this far
[01:03:16.280 --> 01:03:22.840]  down the road here I have no idea and you know even when she came to my
[01:03:22.840 --> 01:03:27.520]  breast area when she moved her hand towards me my natural instinct if a
[01:03:27.520 --> 01:03:34.720]  stranger is moving their hands toward that area is to move back you know that's
[01:03:34.720 --> 01:03:39.000]  normal if someone came up to you or to me in the street and did that I wouldn't
[01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:44.080]  be so polite you know well they go to jail I mean if somebody walked over and
[01:03:44.080 --> 01:03:48.840]  grabbed my crotch are gonna get punched in the nose right that's a normal
[01:03:48.840 --> 01:03:53.080]  reaction it seems people have habituated to this they've been completely
[01:03:53.080 --> 01:03:58.480]  pacified and brainwashed I can't even it still blows my mind I can't even figure
[01:03:58.480 --> 01:04:01.880]  it out well by the way Rob do saw this happen and even got some of it on tape
[01:04:01.880 --> 01:04:06.120]  we got back from a talker speech I gave the keynote dress in New York a few
[01:04:06.120 --> 01:04:12.840]  years ago and this guy walks up big mean-looking prison guy and it says you
[01:04:12.840 --> 01:04:18.240]  know hello mr. Jones and then grabs both of my pectorals and tries to do it you
[01:04:18.240 --> 01:04:22.440]  know twister it was excruciating but I knew it was a setup and then call the
[01:04:22.440 --> 01:04:25.800]  police they put him in handcuffs we're gonna arrest him and I went you know
[01:04:25.800 --> 01:04:29.040]  this is a setup I said you know just know I could have sent you to jail and I
[01:04:29.040 --> 01:04:33.280]  left but they wanted me to get in a fight I mean I I mean it's kind of like
[01:04:33.280 --> 01:04:36.960]  what they kind of stuff they did to garrison in airports and things I've
[01:04:36.960 --> 01:04:40.440]  got to really watch my back so folks pray for us I'll see you at Bilderberg you
[01:04:40.440 --> 01:04:45.600]  are going correct yes absolutely all right look forward to your reporting for
[01:04:45.600 --> 01:04:48.960]  info wars calm they're very very exciting Ashley Jessica look forward to

[01:04:55.400 --> 01:05:03.080]  bunch of other news folks stay with us I had tried everything I'd cut back the
[01:05:03.080 --> 01:05:06.240]  amount of food I was eating I was lifting weights and jogging but

[01:10:19.400 --> 01:10:25.160]  hate speech and then they cut to a clip of me out of context to make it sound
[01:10:25.160 --> 01:10:31.560]  like I'm involved in that I mean it's just they are desperate you've got MSNBC
[01:10:31.560 --> 01:10:35.720]  you've got Bill O'Reilly you've got the White House coming after this you've
[01:10:35.720 --> 01:10:44.360]  got you've got let's not exaggerate at least 10 different investigative
[01:10:44.360 --> 01:10:48.000]  journalists groups some of them are whole teams Bloomberg now I've learned
[01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:53.640]  that's three people full-time in the last two weeks on us digging through
[01:10:53.640 --> 01:10:59.240]  everything and they're getting pretty upset right now I would imagine because
[01:10:59.240 --> 01:11:07.360]  there's just nothing there and there have been four different media groups
[01:11:07.360 --> 01:11:11.080]  that go I want to follow you to Bilderberg and I go okay go ahead and they

[01:13:12.520 --> 01:13:17.720]  schizoid you know break with reality kind of like there's no amnesty in the

[01:14:25.280 --> 01:14:31.920]  because you won't subject your children and your wife and yourself just even
[01:14:31.920 --> 01:14:37.640]  Tara's wrong you know he's not even doing his TV show this year they've been
[01:14:37.640 --> 01:14:41.360]  calling me I need I need to call them I've been so busy I was basically offered
[01:14:41.360 --> 01:14:49.320]  Ventura's TV show or a spin-off thereof and I just I just said no because I've
[01:14:49.320 --> 01:14:52.440]  turned down not bragging I'm telling you you make Bill O'Reilly wants to say I'm
[01:14:52.440 --> 01:14:56.080]  nobody and won't say my name when he attacks me almost on a monthly basis
[01:14:56.080 --> 01:15:03.440]  when I've turned down discovery channel shows travel channel shows true TV
[01:15:03.440 --> 01:15:14.160]  shows HBO just just you name it because I don't have time to fly around and shoot
[01:15:14.160 --> 01:15:20.560]  for a week per episode and shoot 12 15 episodes and then make you know even
[01:15:20.560 --> 01:15:24.160]  brand-new shows that are highly paid $200,000 don't pay for anything around
[01:15:24.160 --> 01:15:30.240]  here and then not do the radio show not do the news website see we have our own
[01:15:30.240 --> 01:15:35.040]  thing and as much as I like that you know the crew that event or show that
[01:15:35.040 --> 01:15:39.160]  the overall did a great job they're like so you don't want to fly out here and
[01:15:39.160 --> 01:15:43.840]  explore doing the show they first brought to me like two years ago and I
[01:15:43.840 --> 01:15:46.800]  think they couldn't convince Ventura to do the next season and Ventura's like
[01:15:46.800 --> 01:15:50.600]  you know what and who knows it might come back sometime he's just I'm not
[01:15:50.600 --> 01:15:54.640]  flying you're gonna have to get me private jets and that's what they do and
[01:15:54.640 --> 01:16:00.040]  that's above their budget he goes I will not have people do that to me
[01:16:00.040 --> 01:16:05.240]  there people like it you know grow up Jesse I mean let people stand around
[01:16:05.240 --> 01:16:11.800]  going hi governor I like your TV show I liked you on WWE or you know
[01:16:11.800 --> 01:16:16.120]  WWF back of the time whatever it was hey how's it going blah blah and he's
[01:16:16.120 --> 01:16:25.240]  sitting there getting angry and then Ventura like two days later every time
[01:16:25.240 --> 01:16:28.840]  we've flown comes over apologized and go sorry I've been grumpy because I've
[01:16:28.840 --> 01:16:31.960]  known Ventura when he didn't have enough flies a big teddy bear but whenever
[01:16:31.960 --> 01:16:36.280]  that happens for like two days he's real angry we almost gotten of not really in
[01:16:36.280 --> 01:16:40.520]  a fight but a big argument in a cab he gets mad everybody else because he's so
[01:16:40.520 --> 01:16:45.640]  angry about somebody rubbing the inside of his butt I mean you know I mean I
[01:16:45.640 --> 01:16:48.520]  hate that to sit there and talk about things like this on the radio but you
[01:16:48.520 --> 01:16:54.120]  know as a man it's really freaky and I know why women get mad at this to sit
[01:16:54.120 --> 01:16:57.040]  there I don't keep talking about it it just really hit me that they're
[01:16:57.040 --> 01:17:03.240]  criticizing Ashley Jessica sounds like a clothing line doesn't it it's a great
[01:17:03.240 --> 01:17:10.600]  name the point is is that is that they're like how dare you not like them
[01:17:10.600 --> 01:17:20.760]  grabbing your crotch I mean it's like listen you don't do that to somebody
[01:17:20.760 --> 01:17:24.880]  unless you know the lights are low and then everybody's into it and there's
[01:17:24.880 --> 01:17:30.520]  been some vino flowing I mean and then they go and they get they do it to your
[01:17:30.520 --> 01:17:38.840]  kids man and listen I never made a big deal out of this because you know it's
[01:17:38.840 --> 01:17:43.760]  private it's my family I'm into it I I one time had TSA style security without
[01:17:43.760 --> 01:17:50.720]  me even knowing start groping my kids at a border and I flipped out and yeah so
[01:17:50.720 --> 01:17:55.560]  mean I know it just that's the line you're not crossing is my kids so my
[01:17:55.560 --> 01:17:59.280]  wife like the kids want to fly I want to fly and I said fine you want to go to
[01:17:59.280 --> 01:18:03.960]  Europe where you grew up I said you can go take a trip to Europe I'll keep the
[01:18:03.960 --> 01:18:10.920]  kids you go with your friends to Europe you know she her dad was a diplomat and
[01:18:10.920 --> 01:18:15.360]  so she grew up in France and grew up in Italy and grew up in Denmark and she
[01:18:15.360 --> 01:18:19.440]  hasn't been back since college she went to college over there too and I said
[01:18:19.440 --> 01:18:23.880]  listen you've already experienced what happens when somebody grabs my kids I
[01:18:23.880 --> 01:18:27.960]  cannot handle this anymore and and if they can get away with this thing or
[01:18:27.960 --> 01:18:32.120]  anything okay here's some of the news I got coming up Bill O'Reilly smears Alex
[01:18:32.120 --> 01:18:37.920]  Jones and HB Trent this is the biggest sign yet he does this routinely now that
[01:18:37.920 --> 01:18:41.560]  we're really having an effect when they trot out O'Reilly and I mean he does
[01:18:41.560 --> 01:18:47.320]  this just because he knows that we're for real and he knows that our audience is
[01:18:47.320 --> 01:18:50.720]  bigger than his I mean we have more viewers on YouTube every week than he
[01:18:50.720 --> 01:18:55.560]  has on Fox he's got about five million different people that tune in at one
[01:18:55.560 --> 01:18:59.440]  time or another three million on a big night for him people like well that in
[01:18:59.440 --> 01:19:02.880]  that five times three million no it's the same audience tuning in and nothing
[01:19:02.880 --> 01:19:06.520]  against them we're all gonna be old one day love old folks but his audience
[01:19:06.520 --> 01:19:10.080]  the reason his ratings are going down is his audience is dying and there have
[01:19:10.080 --> 01:19:15.880]  been studies on that and and so every day there's less of them and so he's
[01:19:15.880 --> 01:19:19.480]  really angry you know he's you know old tough guy reportedly and he's you know
[01:19:19.480 --> 01:19:27.160]  angry that you know that I'm not a sellout like him and I'm not gonna say
[01:19:27.160 --> 01:19:35.800]  anymore the point is the point is is that the house judiciary chairman has
[01:19:35.800 --> 01:19:39.640]  come out and said that holders should design that's good news Navy considers
[01:19:39.640 --> 01:19:44.720]  3d printable future fleet of drones this is what we want robot factories
[01:19:44.720 --> 01:19:49.080]  building robot drones only have the guns but we don't have the guns and we've
[01:19:49.080 --> 01:19:54.240]  got a bunch of other just off the chart news IRS cross green line pro-Israel

[01:23:58.040 --> 01:24:22.040]  getting better
[01:24:22.040 --> 01:24:26.960]  you know the reason I spent a little bit of time on the O'Reilly thing is when
[01:24:26.960 --> 01:24:32.600]  you have Glen Beck saying I'm a fascist and I'm a liar and I'm spooky and you've
[01:24:32.600 --> 01:24:38.280]  got CNN attacking me and lying about us and MSNBC and below O'Reilly what does
[01:24:38.280 --> 01:24:48.800]  that tell you the establishment is scared of things they don't control and the
[01:24:48.800 --> 01:24:52.320]  fact that we are successful on air the fact that by the grace of God and your
[01:24:52.320 --> 01:24:57.440]  prayers and support we are on air is a testimony that we can turn things around
[01:24:57.440 --> 01:25:02.040]  but we've got to believe we can do that but everybody in the office said they
[01:25:02.040 --> 01:25:08.960]  saw this Bill O'Reilly thing this morning from yesterday and they saw it and
[01:25:08.960 --> 01:25:15.800]  they just couldn't believe it here's the media I'd story Bill O'Reilly decries
[01:25:15.800 --> 01:25:20.920]  political hate speech graphic singles on Alex Jones and they've got leftist
[01:25:20.920 --> 01:25:27.320]  authoritarian grips praising O'Reilly saying good shut down people like Alex
[01:25:27.320 --> 01:25:32.120]  Jones but then others going well wait you're hateful too what is hate speech
[01:25:32.120 --> 01:25:36.920]  the Soviets developed this back in the 30s and would send people to gulags saying
[01:25:36.920 --> 01:25:40.400]  it's hateful to talk about about communism it's hateful to talk about how
[01:25:40.400 --> 01:25:43.920]  we shut down your churches it's not hateful we take you to a forced labor
[01:25:43.920 --> 01:25:48.280]  camp or rape your family or shoot you in the back of the head and now I have an
[01:25:48.280 --> 01:25:54.320]  article that Watson is going to come on dealing with after the break where you've
[01:25:54.320 --> 01:25:57.640]  heard Scotland is doing what Germany's doing trying to ban homeschooling and
[01:25:57.640 --> 01:26:05.760]  things and saying every child at birth at birth will have a social worker assigned
[01:26:05.760 --> 01:26:12.440]  to them who is their government parent and now midwives are ordered to spy on
[01:26:12.440 --> 01:26:17.080]  parents to see if they say anything about open borders or immigrants and then
[01:26:17.080 --> 01:26:22.840]  their children will be taken see the Stasi want your kids but don't say the
[01:26:22.840 --> 01:26:26.640]  government's bad or we'll have to take your kids and then Bill O'Reilly comes
[01:26:26.640 --> 01:26:31.560]  out and praises Facebook for if we're shutting out hate speech and sex hate
[01:26:31.560 --> 01:26:36.280]  speech and if you call him say I'm gonna kill you I'm gonna rape you that is
[01:26:36.280 --> 01:26:39.880]  that is a terrific threat but what is hate speech hate speech is saying things
[01:26:39.880 --> 01:26:43.040]  they don't like what is the ADL and so then Barbie Law Center say I'm hate
[01:26:43.040 --> 01:26:47.760]  speech I need to be shut down these are authoritarians that call ending the
[01:26:47.760 --> 01:26:51.040]  first amendment just like the IRS is trying to do with pro-life groups and
[01:26:51.040 --> 01:26:54.440]  Christian groups and tea parties they call that hate speech I've got clips of
[01:26:54.440 --> 01:26:59.480]  MSNBC saying the Tea Party is hate speech good have the IRS shut them down
[01:26:59.480 --> 01:27:05.720]  and then Bill O'Reilly even if I was a racist coo close clan show which I would
[01:27:05.720 --> 01:27:08.600]  disagree with I'm trying to bring humanity together that people have that
[01:27:08.600 --> 01:27:18.400]  first amendment right to free speech because if you take the Klan people's
[01:27:18.400 --> 01:27:22.160]  stuff away or the new Black Panther Party that's basically the black clan if
[01:27:22.160 --> 01:27:26.360]  you take their rights away or Metro or La Raza all the Hispanic supremacist
[01:27:26.360 --> 01:27:30.880]  groups if you take their speech away you will lose yours as well now O'Reilly
[01:27:30.880 --> 01:27:36.320]  like something out of 1984 went past the deception of Rachel Maddow and others
[01:27:36.320 --> 01:27:40.560]  where she said I said Obama sent the tornado I said no such thing a caller
[01:27:40.560 --> 01:27:43.640]  asked is this government I think it is and I said no I don't think it is
[01:27:43.640 --> 01:27:48.440]  probably a real tornado but they can create hurricanes and stuff there is
[01:27:48.440 --> 01:27:51.880]  weather weapons and I read like National Geographic headlines on the air they
[01:27:51.880 --> 01:27:55.920]  edited that out so why are they doing this now he does this incredibly deceptive
[01:27:55.920 --> 01:28:02.280]  piece where he just flashes me up there ranting out of context in between
[01:28:02.280 --> 01:28:07.040]  sexual hate speech whatever that means like I'm doing sexual stuff when he's
[01:28:07.040 --> 01:28:11.160]  the guy who settled cases out of court punch up info wars I mean look at what
[01:28:11.160 --> 01:28:15.400]  a perv this guy looks like no wonder he can't get women or let's let's let's
[01:28:15.400 --> 01:28:18.480]  punch O'Reilly up you were a woman would you want to get anywhere near that guy
[01:28:18.480 --> 01:28:22.760]  it's like a giant ferret or something but let's go to a clip of O'Reilly here
[01:28:22.760 --> 01:28:27.320]  he is tonight there's only so many stupid people out there to
[01:28:27.320 --> 01:28:33.000]  Republicans admittedly they breathe kind of fast because they're too dumb you
[01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:35.600]  know what it's like to go to sleep every night knowing you work for a bunch of
[01:28:35.600 --> 01:28:39.440]  psychotic killers and you back as a public and end up killing me one day hate
[01:28:39.440 --> 01:28:45.120]  speech now Facebook is apologizing for allowing it worldwide but can anything be
[01:28:45.120 --> 01:28:49.880]  done to stop the hatred which is directly linked into the IRS tea party
[01:28:49.880 --> 01:28:55.800]  scandal we'll have a factor investigation all right hate speech in the IRS
[01:28:55.800 --> 01:28:58.680]  scandal the stop right there I'm not going to go any more of it the full
[01:28:58.680 --> 01:29:05.240]  things up on info wars calm but first they have Randy Rhodes on her little
[01:29:05.240 --> 01:29:11.040]  show on whatever's left of air America like 15 stations or something saying
[01:29:11.040 --> 01:29:15.600]  Republicans breathe fast and are stupid so that's hate speech no that's her
[01:29:15.600 --> 01:29:19.560]  right to be obsessed with how smart liberals are when we've gone out and
[01:29:19.560 --> 01:29:24.840]  senior supporters they are the dumbest people they hardly have a pulse I mean
[01:29:24.840 --> 01:29:30.760]  jellyfish have more brain cells then they sandwich it in with me and then go
[01:29:30.760 --> 01:29:36.120]  into a piece about sex stuff just to imply I'm a Democrat I'm attacking the
[01:29:36.120 --> 01:29:45.440]  tea party and I'm a pervert like the 250 pound demonic ferret himself who

[01:42:35.280 --> 01:42:39.400]  start here so you've heard of hate speech that means criticizing the
[01:42:39.400 --> 01:42:44.480]  government posting photos of a Monsanto March anything if you're a navy shield
[01:42:44.480 --> 01:42:47.720]  group criticizing Benghazi you're not allowed to share that on Facebook
[01:42:47.720 --> 01:42:52.160]  YouTube starting to block it and the they take over the web they claim it's a
[01:42:52.160 --> 01:42:55.400]  public commons and they're not allowed to do it even though they own their own
[01:42:55.400 --> 01:43:01.320]  company because it's false advertising they just label your speech as hate
[01:43:01.320 --> 01:43:05.960]  everybody goes well oh what's the label oh Nazis are or hacking and then it's not
[01:43:05.960 --> 01:43:12.040]  that it's it's your kids at a Monsanto March it's you criticizing Obama it's a
[01:43:12.040 --> 01:43:15.360]  pro-second amendment meme you try to say your pro-second amendment on Facebook
[01:43:15.360 --> 01:43:19.840]  they'll delete or block your account it is a reign of covert censorship just
[01:43:19.840 --> 01:43:25.080]  like they're persecuting the Tea Party the pro-lifers the preachers they want a
[01:43:25.080 --> 01:43:28.320]  chilling effect that's why they're persecuting mainstream media that tries
[01:43:28.320 --> 01:43:32.880]  to expose corruption they want you scared to shut up but it's backfiring
[01:43:32.880 --> 01:43:37.400]  people are angry and let's look at Europe let's look at England let's look at
[01:43:37.400 --> 01:43:42.280]  the UK that on average is about five years ahead of us when it comes to the
[01:43:42.280 --> 01:43:46.200]  Orwellian police state the spy grid a lot of we're out of them and some things
[01:43:46.200 --> 01:43:50.740]  there in the US but usually in carbon taxes you name it Europe in England the
[01:43:50.740 --> 01:43:54.280]  UK Australia New Zealand globalist controlled as well they're about five
[01:43:54.280 --> 01:43:58.640]  years ahead of us they are arresting hundreds of homeschooling parents a lot
[01:43:58.640 --> 01:44:01.960]  of them are scientists doctors you name it they homeschool their own children in
[01:44:01.960 --> 01:44:05.040]  Germany even if you have a teaching degree they only train your kids you've
[01:44:05.040 --> 01:44:09.640]  got to send them to this to the state that's where modern education began
[01:44:09.640 --> 01:44:13.600]  taking the kids away and in Prussia kindergarten the brainwashing system that
[01:44:13.600 --> 01:44:16.920]  military conscripts follow orders worked well for Hitler a hundred years
[01:44:16.920 --> 01:44:23.840]  later so you've got all that going on and now I saw this in the BBC like six
[01:44:23.840 --> 01:44:28.000]  seven years ago he had him on Robin Page host of one man and his dog a popular
[01:44:28.000 --> 01:44:31.880]  rural show where he would walk from town to town with a film crew and drink the
[01:44:31.880 --> 01:44:35.720]  beer eat the eat the you know whatever the speciality was in the town and stay
[01:44:35.720 --> 01:44:40.680]  at old bed and breakfasts he gave a speech where they were banning basically
[01:44:40.680 --> 01:44:44.560]  most hunting in England Fox hunting you name it but he said rural communities
[01:44:44.560 --> 01:44:48.160]  deserve the same rights by the way he's pretty much a liberal but of like a real
[01:44:48.160 --> 01:44:50.920]  liberal Thomas Jefferson type liberal he said we're looking at these deserve the
[01:44:50.920 --> 01:44:55.480]  same cultural rights as Muslims or homosexuals they arrested Robin Page we
[01:44:55.480 --> 01:45:00.480]  had him on BBC for saying the word homosexual that's like if you said
[01:45:00.480 --> 01:45:05.120]  Anglo arresting you saying that's racist science words are now hateful I
[01:45:05.120 --> 01:45:09.960]  heard a guy I said this last week I was at Martin Springs it was a spandex guy
[01:45:09.960 --> 01:45:14.240]  and two white guys swimming they were playing water football throwing a ball
[01:45:14.240 --> 01:45:17.120]  around and I'm sitting there listening to him laying there in the sun after I'd
[01:45:17.120 --> 01:45:21.880]  swam a couple miles and I said like a mile that day I think and I'm sitting
[01:45:21.880 --> 01:45:25.000]  there listening to him my heart's thumping away I just got an arm go
[01:45:25.000 --> 01:45:29.120]  let's go eat Chinese food over at whatever the name of the place was and
[01:45:29.120 --> 01:45:34.720]  they go shh dude you can't say Chinese don't eat that's racist and then I saw
[01:45:34.720 --> 01:45:38.360]  people going approvingly looking going yes little laying around on the green
[01:45:38.360 --> 01:45:43.560]  grass with the other people are going oh I mean people think that you can't even
[01:45:43.560 --> 01:45:49.280]  talking is like illegal okay and I remember seeing articles in the British
[01:45:49.280 --> 01:45:53.040]  News you can pull this up where undercover police are to be put in cafes
[01:45:53.040 --> 01:45:57.000]  for racist speech and you'll be arrested and if you say they're giving the
[01:45:57.000 --> 01:45:59.440]  foreigners all the jobs they're paying their welfare they're opening up the
[01:45:59.440 --> 01:46:04.440]  borders so they're voting away are you are arrested but then the charges are
[01:46:04.440 --> 01:46:07.600]  always dropped because the charges don't even really say that it's all
[01:46:07.600 --> 01:46:12.280]  intimidation and that's how they operate over there so joining us here's the
[01:46:12.280 --> 01:46:17.840]  article on info wars.com government orders midwives to spy on racist parents
[01:46:17.840 --> 01:46:21.640]  spy program part of our William plan to have children report on their mother
[01:46:21.640 --> 01:46:26.480]  and father and then of course now he reported a few days ago that's by the
[01:46:26.480 --> 01:46:30.240]  way in their major papers Watson's reporting on that they're reporting that
[01:46:30.240 --> 01:46:34.720]  every parent every group of parents will have a government parent that was with
[01:46:34.720 --> 01:46:39.640]  the child for 18 years teaching them how to teach like like Al Gore told kids a
[01:46:39.640 --> 01:46:43.200]  few years ago it was recorded he said go home and tell your parents the right
[01:46:43.200 --> 01:46:47.520]  way to be you're their boss now this is the essence of authoritarianism the
[01:46:47.520 --> 01:46:55.120]  Hitler Youth 1984 they come home and denounce you this is hellish see they
[01:46:55.120 --> 01:46:58.800]  can't win with their authoritarianism with the adults they but they're getting
[01:46:58.800 --> 01:47:05.160]  the kids Paul Watson devastating article totally creepy and then again the
[01:47:05.160 --> 01:47:10.200]  midwife the it says every week the government parent will take the child
[01:47:10.200 --> 01:47:15.240]  away for a meal let's talk about your parents are they smoking marijuana are
[01:47:15.240 --> 01:47:17.880]  they yelling at you because we're gonna and the kid doesn't know they're gonna
[01:47:17.880 --> 01:47:21.520]  take the kid if the parents yell at them there's no law but they don't care
[01:47:21.520 --> 01:47:24.920]  they have eugenics courts and again it's usually a pedophile you know it's
[01:47:24.920 --> 01:47:29.080]  gonna be there I mean Chevelle who brought you know kids of the royal family
[01:47:29.080 --> 01:47:33.280]  reportedly you know he was a person that was allowed to take the kids from the
[01:47:33.280 --> 01:47:36.320]  parents he liked to take care of me also like to have sex with dead bodies
[01:47:36.320 --> 01:47:40.920]  maybe maybe maybe maybe the maybe Watson they'll teach the kids how to have
[01:47:40.920 --> 01:47:47.120]  sex with dead bodies well Alex you know under Chow Chesky's Romanian dictatorship
[01:47:47.120 --> 01:47:52.400]  15% of all the informants were children informing on their parents and
[01:47:52.400 --> 01:47:56.680]  apparently Scotland is interested in using that template for their own system
[01:47:56.680 --> 01:48:01.480]  because you remember the story from last year about foster parents having three
[01:48:01.480 --> 01:48:05.760]  children taken away from them by the state because of their support for
[01:48:05.760 --> 01:48:10.520]  UKIP which is a mainstream political party that just happens to oppose
[01:48:10.520 --> 01:48:15.200]  uncontrolled immigration into the United Kingdom as a result of that had
[01:48:15.200 --> 01:48:19.160]  their three foster children taken away they were perfectly good parents in
[01:48:19.160 --> 01:48:24.040]  every other regard well this is that on steroids and it's going to be from birth
[01:48:24.040 --> 01:48:28.520]  and it's already happening they didn't even wait to pass it in Parliament like
[01:48:28.520 --> 01:48:33.480]  the named state guarding guardian that you were just talking about this is
[01:48:33.480 --> 01:48:37.920]  already in effect it's called getting it right for every child and it's a
[01:48:37.920 --> 01:48:43.040]  Scottish government programme where these midwives for parents that are
[01:48:43.040 --> 01:48:47.400]  having newborn babies are ordered to spy on the parents listen to their
[01:48:47.400 --> 01:48:54.120]  conversations give them tests if they quote respect and value diversity and
[01:48:54.120 --> 01:48:58.720]  if they give due prominence their racial ethnic and cultural heritage so
[01:48:58.720 --> 01:49:03.960]  they're basically trying to use political hate speech racism as they deem it
[01:49:03.960 --> 01:49:09.320]  to ferret out these you know extremist parents and then if they're if they
[01:49:09.320 --> 01:49:13.920]  raise alarm bells if they raise a suspicion they're then given another
[01:49:13.920 --> 01:49:18.960]  formal investigation and if they're deemed to be you know culturally
[01:49:18.960 --> 01:49:23.280]  insensitive or racist then the state takes the baby away and this is already
[01:49:23.280 --> 01:49:28.480]  happening across Scotland not even a vote on it it's all well into the extreme
[01:49:28.480 --> 01:49:32.600]  no no I mean this is the secret police who again are just going to use the
[01:49:32.600 --> 01:49:37.080]  foreigners to break down the country and vote in and so the Scots are saying I'm
[01:49:37.080 --> 01:49:40.480]  proud of being Scott your kids are gone and they're going to be getting gang
[01:49:40.480 --> 01:49:44.560]  raped in a couple hours by the government literally an army of pedophiles
[01:49:44.560 --> 01:49:51.120]  Scotland of course is famous for their CPSP pedophile run go ahead well and then
[01:49:51.120 --> 01:49:55.360]  that there's a second part to it which is gonna be put up for a vote in the
[01:49:55.360 --> 01:49:59.120]  Scottish Parliament which is the children and young people bill and that's
[01:49:59.120 --> 01:50:04.080]  gonna ensure that every intimate detail of a child is recorded stored on a
[01:50:04.080 --> 01:50:09.280]  central database and then as you said a named state guardian is assigned to
[01:50:09.280 --> 01:50:15.240]  every single child giving them access to the child spying on the family and then
[01:50:15.240 --> 01:50:19.600]  they actually get the child to fill out a questionnaire rating their parents from
[01:50:19.600 --> 01:50:25.320]  one to ten this is that this is already going on public schools here and they
[01:50:25.320 --> 01:50:28.160]  put it in government databases why everything's on computer now this is
[01:50:28.160 --> 01:50:32.680]  the state in your family in your life you would put up with this from no one
[01:50:32.680 --> 01:50:36.000]  but the government Watson I want to cover this more we have a short Leanne

[01:55:35.400 --> 01:55:39.880]  here with the Orwellian police state and the telescreens and the Walmart's and
[01:55:39.880 --> 01:55:42.480]  then we're gonna go back to you and get your take on how to fight this here it
[01:55:42.480 --> 01:55:48.880]  is the piece 2010 Walmart has spearheaded as see something say something
[01:55:48.880 --> 01:55:54.520]  campaign by broadcasting 1984 s messages from Homeland Security head Janet
[01:55:54.520 --> 01:55:59.840]  Napolitano that encourages Walmart shoppers to spy on each other hi I'm
[01:55:59.840 --> 01:56:04.520]  Janet Napolitano secretary of the Department of Homeland Security
[01:56:04.520 --> 01:56:10.960]  Homeland Security begins with hometown security that's why I'm pleased that
[01:56:10.960 --> 01:56:16.280]  Walmart is helping to make our communities more safe and secure if you see
[01:56:16.280 --> 01:56:20.480]  something suspicious in the parking lot or in the store say something
[01:56:20.480 --> 01:56:24.800]  immediately so it should be no surprise that police visited a father of three
[01:56:24.800 --> 01:56:28.520]  this weekend after he went to Walmart with his children to cash a check
[01:56:28.520 --> 01:56:33.040]  Walmart security alerted authorities to a possible kidnapping of three young
[01:56:33.040 --> 01:56:37.640]  girls all because the security guard thought it was strange that the girls
[01:56:37.640 --> 01:56:42.000]  weren't the same race as their white father police who were at his home when
[01:56:42.000 --> 01:56:46.240]  he arrived made the oldest child confirm that the man with them was their
[01:56:46.240 --> 01:56:51.400]  father but this is not new in 2009 a couple lost custody of their children
[01:56:51.400 --> 01:56:55.640]  when Walmart photo center employees alerted police to pictures they thought
[01:56:55.640 --> 01:57:00.560]  were akin to child porn the photos were of the couple's children taking baths
[01:57:00.560 --> 01:57:05.000]  and being wrapped in towels that couple is now in the midst of a lawsuit with
[01:57:05.000 --> 01:57:09.840]  Walmart back in 2010 when big sis became the head of the Walmartian Snoop
[01:57:09.840 --> 01:57:14.680]  Society Alex Jones had plenty to say about the DHS's invasion into our
[01:57:14.680 --> 01:57:21.120]  lives under the threat of a terrorist attack well it's here 1984 in America
[01:57:21.120 --> 01:57:25.680]  this is the straw that breaks the camels back there is no doubt that we're in
[01:57:25.680 --> 01:57:29.880]  deep trouble as a society the head of Homeland Security big sis Janet
[01:57:29.880 --> 01:57:34.400]  Napolitano has now come out and announced that over 800 Walmart's in the
[01:57:34.400 --> 01:57:39.440]  next month are going to install telescreens at the checkout scanner with
[01:57:39.440 --> 01:57:46.760]  different federal orders to spy on the other people shopping but don't worry
[01:57:46.760 --> 01:57:51.680]  as we reported in 2011 if you're one of the many good citizens that are
[01:57:51.680 --> 01:57:55.560]  reporting suspicious activity Homeland Security wants to shield you from
[01:57:55.560 --> 01:57:59.440]  facing the consequences of misidentifying innocent behavior as
[01:57:59.440 --> 01:58:04.120]  extremism or terrorism of course this will only encourage an army of
[01:58:04.120 --> 01:58:09.080]  ill-equipped citizen spies to report any behavior whatsoever no matter how be
[01:58:09.080 --> 01:58:13.880]  nine see something say something unless of course you're blowing the whistle on

[02:02:45.000 --> 02:02:49.680]  the back entrance of the hotel is all gonna be blocked off nobody's gonna be
[02:02:49.680 --> 02:02:53.920]  able to get anywhere near it part of the road is completely blocked off they're
[02:02:53.920 --> 02:02:57.160]  gonna have a police checkpoint the right now that's where everybody's gonna be
[02:02:57.160 --> 02:03:03.240]  coming in I told you Paul and guess how big the protest area is not very big at
[02:03:03.240 --> 02:03:09.040]  all according to what I'm told that's where they're gonna come in that the
[02:03:09.040 --> 02:03:12.120]  authorities said oh we're gonna facilitate your right to free press and
[02:03:12.120 --> 02:03:16.440]  protest you're not because they're all gonna come in the back entrance nobody's
[02:03:16.440 --> 02:03:20.000]  gonna see any build well like I told the head cop I said I'm not planning on
[02:03:20.000 --> 02:03:22.440]  leading the demonstrations or anything but it sounds like we're gonna have to
[02:03:22.440 --> 02:03:25.840]  command the whole operation because I mean I know everything's gonna happen
[02:03:25.840 --> 02:03:29.840]  we'll just go wherever we want on the side of the road wherever it's it's
[02:03:29.840 --> 02:03:32.840]  supposedly a free country over there I told him I said I'm gonna go around the
[02:03:32.840 --> 02:03:37.640]  perimeter with a long lens and take photos of this non-existent meeting well
[02:03:37.640 --> 02:03:42.360]  if they're closing it off under anti terror guys as when the real terrorists are inside but
[02:03:42.360 --> 02:03:47.840]  they've also the council in its idiocy because a thousand two thousand people
[02:03:47.840 --> 02:03:52.400]  are gonna be descending on the scene anyway they've rejected the planning
[02:03:52.400 --> 02:03:57.440]  application to hold this festival in a nearby park so now you've got thousands
[02:03:57.440 --> 02:04:01.640]  of people descending to hear Alex Jones and David I speak and they've got no
[02:04:01.640 --> 02:04:06.760]  where to go so this moronic council has created a bigger problem for itself by
[02:04:06.760 --> 02:04:11.240]  rejecting this application because the mayor said it's terrorism to protest she
[02:04:11.240 --> 02:04:14.960]  said it's bad to protest and I'm so honored to have Bilderberg I mean how
[02:04:14.960 --> 02:04:20.400]  dare them this is North Korea we don't allow protesting in Wattford well
[02:04:20.400 --> 02:04:24.560]  exactly now the residents who live in in the area have got to show their passport
[02:04:24.560 --> 02:04:29.000]  just to get down their own street and I mean either we do it the easy way or the
[02:04:29.000 --> 02:04:33.200]  hard way the easy way is so now the cops are not even gonna let us try to get
[02:04:33.200 --> 02:04:39.080]  down main roads on public streets no it's all blocked off for pedestrians
[02:04:39.080 --> 02:04:43.120]  prohibited I'm looking at the maps all we do is have the maps and get wherever
[02:04:43.120 --> 02:04:46.200]  they've backed it up I mean they're not gonna be able to block it all off and
[02:04:46.200 --> 02:04:49.960]  they're just gonna show everybody how they're blocking free speech for this
[02:04:49.960 --> 02:04:54.080]  group of globalist stay there I want to recap all this we got a guest coming in

[02:08:43.720 --> 02:08:48.800]  and its links to autism she was in the March I believe was in Houston against
[02:08:48.800 --> 02:08:52.880]  Monsanto trying to force their poison on us and she put her photos of her and
[02:08:52.880 --> 02:08:56.240]  her children up on her own Facebook and they suspended it and then they blocked
[02:08:56.240 --> 02:08:59.200]  it this is what they've been doing to people across the board if you're
[02:08:59.200 --> 02:09:03.800]  anti-war they do it if your navy seals criticizing Obama they shut down your

[02:09:08.080 --> 02:09:12.080]  our site this is what they do that's all coming up here in just a moment because
[02:09:12.080 --> 02:09:16.360]  it ties into what is hate speech and below Riley praising Facebook for
[02:09:16.360 --> 02:09:20.280]  shutting down free speech I mean what a degenerate when it comes to the first
[02:09:20.280 --> 02:09:23.560]  amendment I mean because I see it as degenerate to not support everybody's
[02:09:23.560 --> 02:09:28.440]  free speech but they don't want a level playing field now Paul Joseph Watson one
[02:09:28.440 --> 02:09:34.080]  of our UK reporters and obviously the editor at prison planet calm he has big
[02:09:34.080 --> 02:09:38.800]  breaking boulder Burke knows I've talked to the head cop involved in my
[02:09:38.800 --> 02:09:42.480]  experience these guys will say you that they're your friend that it's all going
[02:09:42.480 --> 02:09:46.680]  to be great they're going to give you an area to demonstrate that everything will
[02:09:46.680 --> 02:09:50.280]  be fine and then we read the local Watford paper with them saying the
[02:09:50.280 --> 02:09:56.920]  exact opposite and the cop came off is very credible but I mean that's what
[02:09:56.920 --> 02:10:01.200]  they do in their job and it's there to protect the builder bar group from the
[02:10:01.200 --> 02:10:06.600]  media not for their safety they've been indicted before for Lockheed Martin pay
[02:10:06.600 --> 02:10:11.240]  offs they've been you know I mean this is criminal scuff goes on there they'll
[02:10:11.240 --> 02:10:15.160]  decide who's what power plants are going to be allowed to stay open and what are
[02:10:15.160 --> 02:10:18.760]  going to be able to operate I mean that's how real money's made is controlling
[02:10:18.760 --> 02:10:22.000]  the regulators to shut down your competition so the third world can
[02:10:22.000 --> 02:10:25.320]  ever get going because they got fat cats there that don't let anybody operate
[02:10:25.320 --> 02:10:31.400]  but them just like Chilchescu and Romania and as the free market goes off the
[02:10:31.400 --> 02:10:35.960]  window to this monopoly fascism using socialism on the grass roots getting

[02:11:55.440 --> 02:12:00.720]  positions of power this is the takedown of where the Magna Carta came from there
[02:12:00.720 --> 02:12:04.720]  was a thousand years of wars try to get some basic liberty in England and then
[02:12:04.720 --> 02:12:08.880]  those ideas of the Magna Carta came here and when Tony Blair got elected 1996
[02:12:08.880 --> 02:12:13.920]  97 I'll never forget him in the BBC he gave a speech when he said it is my goal
[02:12:13.920 --> 02:12:19.720]  to remove the Magna Carta and everyone was ah it'd be like saying it is my plan
[02:12:19.720 --> 02:12:27.720]  to destroy the Bill of Rights ah just the arrogance we will abolish guys type
[02:12:27.720 --> 02:12:35.800]  in I bet even 15 16 years later it's still up BBC Tony Blair we will abolish
[02:12:35.800 --> 02:12:46.360]  Magna Carta and imagine I will abolish all your freedom and now now you will
[02:12:46.360 --> 02:12:50.880]  get to permit to even be able to have a rally because it's your group said we
[02:12:50.880 --> 02:12:53.880]  want David Ike and Alex Jones to come speak and I said okay I'll go speak at
[02:12:53.880 --> 02:12:58.040]  your event I said if they even let you have it I've read your so-called laws
[02:12:58.040 --> 02:13:04.360]  and it's of course we'll be allowed to have an event oh you think you will what
[02:13:04.360 --> 02:13:08.920]  do you think you are in a free country excuse me let's go to Paul Watson and
[02:13:08.920 --> 02:13:12.800]  then our guests Paul you've got an article coming out soon all info wars
[02:13:12.800 --> 02:13:19.160]  dot com with these maps with these announcements but I call for everybody I
[02:13:19.160 --> 02:13:22.280]  call for everybody in England even if they don't agree with us politically I
[02:13:22.280 --> 02:13:24.920]  think it's great to have foreign bankers there you know buying their
[02:13:24.920 --> 02:13:29.320]  politicians and all of this and in public paying for these you know criminals
[02:13:29.320 --> 02:13:33.520]  to you know not have the media cover them everyone in the UK needs to now go to
[02:13:33.520 --> 02:13:37.640]  Watford because the mayor saying protesting is bad and protesting is
[02:13:37.640 --> 02:13:42.720]  criminal I mean my god this woman needs to move to North Korea well as far as
[02:13:42.720 --> 02:13:47.200]  I understand it Alex from talking to the organizers people like Steve Lee that
[02:13:47.200 --> 02:13:51.440]  police liaison officer have been friendly and helpful this is coming from
[02:13:51.440 --> 02:13:55.920]  the higher level police and the Watford Council and the Watford Council just
[02:13:55.920 --> 02:14:00.040]  needs to stop being silly because you're going to get thousands of people
[02:14:00.040 --> 02:14:04.520]  descending on an event with nowhere to go do they want us all to mass at the
[02:14:04.520 --> 02:14:08.880]  gates of the Grove Hotel which is you know like ten feet across it's not
[02:14:08.880 --> 02:14:13.200]  gonna work it's a public safety issue and the fact that they've denied this
[02:14:13.200 --> 02:14:17.680]  application means that they're putting the public at risk and as he said this
[02:14:17.680 --> 02:14:22.040]  is taxpayer funded this security operation with the police is taxpayer
[02:14:22.040 --> 02:14:25.800]  funded so they've got a duty a right they owe it to the people who are going
[02:14:25.800 --> 02:14:30.040]  down there they owe it to the residents who are now starting to complain there's
[02:14:30.040 --> 02:14:34.560]  a residents meeting on Monday night to grant this approval for this site for
[02:14:34.560 --> 02:14:38.520]  this Bilderberg festival because whether they do or not everybody's gonna turn
[02:14:38.520 --> 02:14:44.120]  up you can guarantee it and I don't think they realize that you want to
[02:14:44.120 --> 02:14:51.120]  assemble this is North Korea I reckon they think that it's just a few dozen
[02:14:51.120 --> 02:14:55.560]  hippies or something that are gonna turn up David Ike and Alex Jones on the
[02:14:55.560 --> 02:14:59.880]  same bill that's never happened before this is a reason for more people to go
[02:14:59.880 --> 02:15:03.680]  if you were thinking about going I mean this should make the decision what'll
[02:15:03.680 --> 02:15:08.040]  happen is we'll go we'll go talk to farmers and people in the area we'll
[02:15:08.040 --> 02:15:11.280]  have listeners there with it is already been emailed by farmers and people we
[02:15:11.280 --> 02:15:14.160]  need to go through our emails and get the folks and we'll just have a couple of
[02:15:14.160 --> 02:15:18.240]  alternate sites we'll announce it info wars.com forward slash Bilderberg and at
[02:15:18.240 --> 02:15:21.760]  the real Alex Jones on Twitter where the event will be we'll have thousands of
[02:15:21.760 --> 02:15:25.760]  people show up for the speeches and if they want to arrest everybody that'll
[02:15:25.760 --> 02:15:30.560]  be even bigger international news we're gonna call Kim Jong-un there in
[02:15:30.560 --> 02:15:34.480]  Watford's bluff on this Watson and if they try to stop me from coming into the
[02:15:34.480 --> 02:15:38.640]  country it's even bigger we only lose when we don't resist their tyranny
[02:15:38.640 --> 02:15:44.080]  Watson. Well exactly I mean this mayor right from the start said oh these
[02:15:44.080 --> 02:15:48.120]  protesters are gonna cause disturbance they're gonna cause violence she set
[02:15:48.120 --> 02:15:51.720]  their agenda right from the very start that's completely unreasonable this
[02:15:51.720 --> 02:15:56.520]  Watford council needs to be reasonable needs to accept reality that they've
[02:15:56.520 --> 02:16:00.960]  got thousands of people descending on their little town next week and they
[02:16:00.960 --> 02:16:04.960]  need to grant the approval for this site otherwise everybody's gonna be in a
[02:16:04.960 --> 02:16:09.160]  tiny pen at the front gates of the Grove Hotel that's not gonna work I mean
[02:16:09.160 --> 02:16:12.360]  people are gonna get crushed there's a main road there people are gonna get
[02:16:12.360 --> 02:16:16.400]  run over it's a massive public safety issue and they haven't dealt with it and
[02:16:16.400 --> 02:16:21.760]  they need to stop. By the way Stan Lee not not the famous you know billion
[02:16:21.760 --> 02:16:27.640]  dollar cartoon guy of Spider-Man fame but but but the British Stan Lee he
[02:16:27.640 --> 02:16:31.840]  sounds completely convincing that he's a nice guy on the phone and a listener so
[02:16:31.840 --> 02:16:36.320]  he's a Academy Award-winning liar but but but he I've got his emails here too
[02:16:36.320 --> 02:16:40.120]  say we're gonna have a large area we're gonna support your free speech and the
[02:16:40.120 --> 02:16:44.840]  press but now the paper saying that's not the case so what's going on here I
[02:16:44.840 --> 02:16:49.400]  think it was him that helped the organizers recommend the site of the
[02:16:49.400 --> 02:16:54.600]  park for the festival so I think he's largely being helpful from the perception
[02:16:54.600 --> 02:16:58.400]  that I get it's the council itself and the higher levels of the police that have
[02:16:58.400 --> 02:17:03.520]  cracked down on it so we need Steve Lee to be honest Watson I didn't want to go
[02:17:03.520 --> 02:17:07.000]  you and my wife and others said you got to go Jim Tucker just died because I
[02:17:07.000 --> 02:17:11.440]  mean it's not I'll have fun once I'm doing it but it's not you know I've
[02:17:11.440 --> 02:17:14.640]  been enough demonstrations I've confronted globalist enough you know I
[02:17:14.640 --> 02:17:19.040]  just I'm sick of it all but I said you watch they're gonna act like total
[02:17:19.040 --> 02:17:23.160]  authoritarians and make this story for us and they're gonna do it that's the
[02:17:23.160 --> 02:17:26.800]  thing about these evil people is that they just think that they're gonna
[02:17:26.800 --> 02:17:30.240]  dominate us and that that's gonna intimidate us Watson and it's gonna be
[02:17:30.240 --> 02:17:34.560]  the opposite well I mean they should learn from their colleagues over in
[02:17:34.560 --> 02:17:38.960]  Switzerland who didn't close any roads off they allowed us free access all
[02:17:38.960 --> 02:17:42.600]  around the hotel there was no incident apart from their fake little bomb
[02:17:42.600 --> 02:17:48.080]  threat that they sell nobody was arrested as far as I know and this security
[02:17:48.080 --> 02:17:53.480]  crackdown anti terror and the police we helped light torches for everybody as well
[02:17:53.480 --> 02:17:59.240]  exactly they were very helpful the police wanted to I'm sorry go ahead we
[02:17:59.240 --> 02:18:02.520]  had a good relationship with the police in Switzerland so if you want to draw
[02:18:02.520 --> 02:18:07.120]  more attention to Bilderberg fine go ahead put up checkpoints stop people
[02:18:07.120 --> 02:18:11.440]  from entering certain residential areas stop people from putting events on in
[02:18:11.440 --> 02:18:15.960]  parks and you'll only create a bigger story if that's how they want to do it
[02:18:15.960 --> 02:18:19.840]  all the Swiss have done nothing but but like have liberty and they got money
[02:18:19.840 --> 02:18:23.200]  pouring out their ears and their police hate the New World Order and we're
[02:18:23.200 --> 02:18:27.400]  buying everybody drinks compared to groveling to the corrupt globalist and
[02:18:27.400 --> 02:18:31.760]  they rob everything you've got yeah and it's the way I'm paying for it as well
[02:18:31.760 --> 02:18:37.160]  we're paying for the checkpoints and the show your ID in the bag searches and
[02:18:37.160 --> 02:18:40.960]  everything how long until you have an article of all these maps and stuff up
[02:18:40.960 --> 02:18:47.200]  at info wars.com straight after I've eaten my dinner all right well done I

[02:24:28.720 --> 02:24:33.240]  medical doctors on of the pesticides the GMO the vaccines pushing over the edge
[02:24:33.240 --> 02:24:37.560]  especially in boys because they say it's genetic well yes genetic boys can't
[02:24:37.560 --> 02:24:40.760]  handle as much adjuvant and mercury they don't have a strong a blood
[02:24:40.760 --> 02:24:46.040]  brain barrier as women any medical doctor will tell you women are at least in
[02:24:46.040 --> 02:24:49.800]  their physiology are tougher than men so women live longer they can survive more

[02:25:13.360 --> 02:25:17.800]  people who posted the Monsanto March hundreds of these came in Mike Adams
[02:25:17.800 --> 02:25:21.280]  wrote a story that was on Drudge over the weekend dealing with that we're going
[02:25:21.280 --> 02:25:26.440]  to put that on screen here in a moment and show the photo that was censored and
[02:25:26.440 --> 02:25:29.480]  then later we'll get into what happened to your child and and and how you're
[02:25:29.480 --> 02:25:33.040]  able to reverse it by the grace of God but what a cute photo there it is that
[02:25:33.040 --> 02:25:37.400]  they that they you know gave you a notice of and blocked organic food it's my
[02:25:37.400 --> 02:25:44.040]  medicine bio pesticides equals autism say no to GMOs I mean that that's evil I
[02:25:44.040 --> 02:25:47.480]  mean you think this is a free country that you're gonna post you march in
[02:25:47.480 --> 02:25:52.460]  Houston you're gonna put that on your Facebook how dare you I miss is a
[02:25:52.460 --> 02:25:59.200]  Mrs. Evil oh hi you want to apologize to Facebook because Bill O'Reilly says this
[02:25:59.200 --> 02:26:07.920]  is good that you were censored hey no hell no I'm very upset that they blocked
[02:26:07.920 --> 02:26:14.760]  my children's pictures they were protesting is there right I I believe
[02:26:14.760 --> 02:26:19.400]  in teaching the children by example no by just telling them how do we know
[02:26:19.400 --> 02:26:24.560]  they're not with al-Qaeda oh please make sarcastic I mean this shows how
[02:26:24.560 --> 02:26:29.960]  screwed up this country is so tell folks what happened I just I just explained
[02:26:29.960 --> 02:26:33.800]  my children what happened to them they were diagnosed with autism now they are
[02:26:33.800 --> 02:26:37.760]  fine and they perfectly understand anything you can explain to them so I
[02:26:37.760 --> 02:26:42.280]  told them I said you guys were hurt by these bio pesticides by these food
[02:26:42.280 --> 02:26:47.200]  being contaminated by these vaccines that are who has a lot of poison in it
[02:26:47.200 --> 02:26:51.680]  and now that you guys are better you got a fight for your food because for my
[02:26:51.680 --> 02:26:57.000]  kids truly organic food is medicine autistic kids if they don't eat organic
[02:26:57.000 --> 02:27:02.280]  food they don't make it explain what bio pesticides are well the difference
[02:27:02.280 --> 02:27:09.680]  between chemical pesticides it's that those were like extracts from plants or
[02:27:09.680 --> 02:27:14.840]  the mic other microbes but it this the it was like the byproduct of the
[02:27:14.840 --> 02:27:20.440]  production of plant sure BP corn and stuff grows about 1,000 times stronger
[02:27:20.440 --> 02:27:23.840]  poison fungus and is actually in it just as one example and and of course it
[02:27:23.840 --> 02:27:27.680]  kills the bugs but we're supposed to eat it well the bio pesticides is
[02:27:27.680 --> 02:27:34.160]  basically a genetic pollution so it is a hundred times more dangerous than just
[02:27:34.160 --> 02:27:40.240]  chemicals because with chemicals you your body can somehow met metallic them
[02:27:40.240 --> 02:27:45.120]  process them and you can excrete them at two one point but when you change your
[02:27:45.120 --> 02:27:51.400]  your when with this bio pesticides the danger is that they are making epigenetic
[02:27:51.400 --> 02:27:54.440]  changes that's right well there's been studies that show it's actually getting
[02:27:54.440 --> 02:28:01.080]  into the totally the genetic studies I attend every but I mean I mean if the
[02:28:01.080 --> 02:28:06.400]  BP kills the honeybees why isn't it good for your children exactly actually the
[02:28:06.400 --> 02:28:10.400]  bees is give me the answer because it was amazing God works in the stairs ways
[02:28:10.400 --> 02:28:15.600]  I have to say don't the bees deserve to die too that they might be with Al-Qaeda
[02:28:15.600 --> 02:28:20.320]  definitely they have to be because this is ridiculous I mean everybody's with
[02:28:20.320 --> 02:28:23.600]  Al-Qaeda only the government and Monsanto are right everybody else is wrong
[02:28:23.600 --> 02:28:30.000]  that's right there you go Riley once or not we have over 2.5 million children
[02:28:30.000 --> 02:28:35.240]  with autism that means 2.5 million families out there that I say please
[02:28:35.240 --> 02:28:39.440]  stop putting poison in our food please stop poison our children and we're the
[02:28:39.440 --> 02:28:44.840]  cuckoos you are bad we are the bad ones good and and and everybody else is
[02:28:44.840 --> 02:28:50.000]  okay is this correct and we are you want to thank Mark Zuckerberg for for

[02:33:03.760 --> 02:33:10.840]  I like to share a revelation that I've had during my time here it came to me
[02:33:10.840 --> 02:33:19.400]  when I tried to classify your species I realized that you're not actually mammals
[02:33:19.400 --> 02:33:25.880]  every mammal on this planet instinctively develops a natural equilibrium
[02:33:25.880 --> 02:33:31.880]  with the surrounding environment but you humans do not you move to an area and
[02:33:31.880 --> 02:33:40.120]  you multiply multiply until every natural resource is consumed the only way you
[02:33:40.120 --> 02:33:45.960]  can survive is to spread to another area
[02:33:48.880 --> 02:33:54.920]  there is another organism on this planet that follows the same pattern
[02:33:54.920 --> 02:34:02.120]  you know what it is a virus and mr. Anderson human beings we're going to
[02:34:02.120 --> 02:34:07.980]  feed you pesticide mr. Anderson answer of this planet gonna soft kill you like mr.
[02:34:07.980 --> 02:34:14.200]  Anderson we don't understand that mr. Anderson
[02:34:15.720 --> 02:34:24.880]  resistance to tyrants is obedience to God it's Alex Jones and Ray Halalama is
[02:34:24.880 --> 02:34:28.120]  here with us I want to hear about Facebook censoring you of course you have
[02:34:28.120 --> 02:34:31.840]  the screenshots of it we got hundreds of emails people showing how it happened
[02:34:31.840 --> 02:34:35.160]  to them it's happened to us where they've suspended our account they've
[02:34:35.160 --> 02:34:38.440]  terminated other people's accounts when we like sent out a Thomas Jefferson meme
[02:34:38.440 --> 02:34:42.920]  that if it gets picked up in as big was a quote about you know how guns restrain
[02:34:42.920 --> 02:34:46.000]  evil everywhere and they just oh you can't have that that makes too much
[02:34:46.000 --> 02:34:50.600]  sense they want to use social networks at Bilderberg and everything to control us
[02:34:50.600 --> 02:34:55.240]  they don't want us using it the other way around but as Facebook censors more
[02:34:55.240 --> 02:34:59.600]  and more people are leaving it but you know I want to get into how you were
[02:34:59.600 --> 02:35:04.440]  able to reverse this in your child and the info you learn because I've seen a
[02:35:04.440 --> 02:35:08.320]  lot of success people detoxing getting an organic food you know it's an auto
[02:35:08.320 --> 02:35:11.880]  immune response in the gut there's a cocktail of things with the spectrum
[02:35:11.880 --> 02:35:14.200]  disorders obviously you're more of an expert on it than I am because you've
[02:35:14.200 --> 02:35:18.960]  lived it but I mean I noticed the accounts they should spend it were
[02:35:18.960 --> 02:35:24.160]  particularly of the March they did not want people unified as humans together
[02:35:24.160 --> 02:35:29.280]  they want us you know in our free speech zones or at home dying from cancer so
[02:35:29.280 --> 02:35:35.360]  so so break down how they censored you and what's happened since then well and
[02:35:35.360 --> 02:35:39.640]  when I came back home from the March I was very excited I wanted to share this
[02:35:39.640 --> 02:35:47.760]  in my private page and in my public page I have two Facebook pages and the
[02:35:47.760 --> 02:35:53.640]  public page when I posted there I also shared with natural news Facebook and
[02:35:53.640 --> 02:35:58.200]  the moment I did that natural news liked the picture and they reposted the
[02:35:58.200 --> 02:36:03.680]  moment they did that I was blocked oh that's good evil free association right
[02:36:03.680 --> 02:36:07.480]  I mean you were sharing photos of a March that's evil yeah well they didn't they
[02:36:07.480 --> 02:36:13.760]  knew that natural news has a bigger network I guess thank God they were
[02:36:13.760 --> 02:36:18.080]  watching you thank God they were watching you they didn't care much when I put it
[02:36:18.080 --> 02:36:21.960]  on mine but they care a lot when I start sharing with no they have they have
[02:36:21.960 --> 02:36:25.800]  built-in metrics when something's going viral that's when they slap it down yeah
[02:36:25.800 --> 02:36:31.320]  so they they blocked me and I got really upset but I wanted to have evidence of
[02:36:31.320 --> 02:36:35.840]  what was happening because it was so unfair that I recommend this to do all
[02:36:35.840 --> 02:36:40.560]  the people on Facebook if Facebook starts sending you these weird messages that
[02:36:40.560 --> 02:36:45.380]  you are blocked for no reason oh they told Darren McBrain he couldn't use his
[02:36:45.380 --> 02:36:48.440]  for whether it was three weeks because he said something mildly political and
[02:36:48.440 --> 02:36:52.400]  they said the way for you to get friends is not be political and again people say
[02:36:52.400 --> 02:36:55.800]  well it's their own site let them do it no they advertise like it's free and open
[02:36:55.800 --> 02:37:01.520]  for free speech it's false advertising Facebook is a giant criminal operation
[02:37:01.520 --> 02:37:05.280]  people ask why are we on Facebook those are all fan pages people created we're
[02:37:05.280 --> 02:37:09.480]  there to use their enemy operation against them exactly I mean the same
[02:37:09.480 --> 02:37:13.880]  thing people wrote me and says oh just quit Facebook Facebook is not public I'm
[02:37:13.880 --> 02:37:19.000]  like no I want to use these against him themselves well they buy up Google has
[02:37:19.000 --> 02:37:22.640]  bought three ad companies we've used and people say well don't use Google they
[02:37:22.640 --> 02:37:27.080]  buy everything we use exactly and at this moment I we don't have a really good
[02:37:27.080 --> 02:37:31.200]  you made Facebook it's supposed to be your info you're sharing it and then they
[02:37:31.200 --> 02:37:35.480]  go we're gonna tell you what you can put and in first it's like porn killing
[02:37:35.480 --> 02:37:39.960]  blah blah no actually sightseeing kill tea partiers or stuff like that that's okay
[02:37:39.960 --> 02:37:44.200]  you're just not allowed to say hey Zuckerberg calls his dumb efforts but
[02:37:44.200 --> 02:37:50.080]  what really upset me Alex is that they are making claims that is completely
[02:37:50.080 --> 02:37:54.920]  false they send me this message saying that my pictures were abusive that's
[02:37:54.920 --> 02:38:00.000]  that's sickening I mean as they always turn it around you're abusive
[02:38:00.000 --> 02:38:04.400]  showing your children at a march with signs let's put the thought crime on
[02:38:04.400 --> 02:38:09.600]  screen this is what is wrong I mean you're bad no I agree you're bad yeah I'm
[02:38:09.600 --> 02:38:16.480]  bad is abusing there he goes and so what I did is I I did a screenshot and this
[02:38:16.480 --> 02:38:20.600]  is what I recommend people to do make a screenshot because it's the only way you
[02:38:20.600 --> 02:38:24.720]  can prove show the shot of her kids again folks I'll show them the evil this
[02:38:24.720 --> 02:38:30.160]  imagine the abuse of that yeah it's insane your children on at a political
[02:38:30.160 --> 02:38:36.400]  march and they should be at home watching video games eating GMO yeah you
[02:38:36.400 --> 02:38:41.520]  want to apologize to Mark Zuckerberg for your you need a state-minded actually
[02:38:41.520 --> 02:38:47.320]  it all these the more they fight us back the more we are gonna resist and the more
[02:38:47.320 --> 02:38:53.080]  we resist the the the better the better world we can have I mean I encourage the
[02:38:53.080 --> 02:38:58.240]  mothers to always continue to fight for their children do what is right and if
[02:38:58.240 --> 02:39:02.240]  Facebook is stopping us from letting the world know that our kids has been heard
[02:39:02.240 --> 02:39:08.040]  by by these pesticides and companies that are producing these these poisons
[02:39:08.040 --> 02:39:12.920]  they have to fight they have we're gonna go into that but if they reinstated your
[02:39:12.920 --> 02:39:19.480]  page actually this is amazing after 24 hours of you guys picking up my story I
[02:39:19.480 --> 02:39:26.200]  think they were sorry my friends they were they were pooping their pants

[02:40:25.800 --> 02:40:34.600]  seething with life yeah it it's very frustrating it's very frustrating Alex
[02:40:34.600 --> 02:40:38.440]  I talk to parents and I try to make them aware of these and they don't understand
[02:40:38.440 --> 02:40:42.640]  how important the food is they have no their children are being assaulted I've
[02:40:42.640 --> 02:40:45.720]  got eco science but by the way all science are and I've got memorandum 200
[02:40:45.720 --> 02:40:50.600]  by Kissinger this is a plan they brag they're doing this yeah I mean because
[02:40:50.600 --> 02:40:54.600]  you know we joke around but you woke up you said no tell us about your two
[02:40:54.600 --> 02:40:57.320]  children and we'll put them back up on screen you don't have to say their names
[02:40:57.320 --> 02:41:00.960]  we don't want to but tell us yeah well was it your older boy that had the
[02:41:00.960 --> 02:41:06.480]  autism you're able to reverse actually yes my oldest son was diagnosed with
[02:41:06.480 --> 02:41:14.480]  profound with very profound autism but my second son was by the time I took him
[02:41:14.480 --> 02:41:18.000]  for the for the evaluation he was borderline because I already started
[02:41:18.000 --> 02:41:22.480]  treatments on him so how did you figure out it was the chemical the bio weapon
[02:41:22.480 --> 02:41:27.440]  in the in the food and other things because what because Godspeed it was
[02:41:27.440 --> 02:41:32.120]  God all the way I have never even hear the word autism before my kids were
[02:41:32.120 --> 02:41:38.680]  strike with it and and things I prayed really really hard and I said dear Lord
[02:41:38.680 --> 02:41:42.880]  you know show me the way I don't need a miracle I know it's gonna be hard I'm
[02:41:42.880 --> 02:41:46.720]  not I'm gonna learn I'm it's gonna be tough I'm willing to take it please
[02:41:46.720 --> 02:41:51.200]  forgive me for mistakes I have done help me show me the way I can't repair this
[02:41:51.200 --> 02:41:57.360]  just show me the way and he did and as soon as my son got diagnosed I made this
[02:41:57.360 --> 02:42:01.440]  amazing mother her name is Dana Gorman thank you Dana I will forever be
[02:42:01.440 --> 02:42:04.940]  thankful to you if you're listening she tell you it was the GMO on the shots no
[02:42:04.940 --> 02:42:11.240]  she she basically took me to the right people and those people made me understand
[02:42:11.240 --> 02:42:16.700]  that my kids had a tremendous impermanent detoxifying and when you look
[02:42:16.700 --> 02:42:20.400]  that if you Google that if you really do a good job finding that out what can
[02:42:20.400 --> 02:42:26.720]  cause that you will find out that are biopesticides and mostly chemicals will
[02:42:26.720 --> 02:42:31.880]  it will not only are the plants are designed to be able to be have toxins
[02:42:31.880 --> 02:42:35.680]  sprayed on and live so that bio human life but then the big deal is a lot of
[02:42:35.680 --> 02:42:39.640]  them have their own natural pharmacological crop growing their own
[02:42:39.640 --> 02:42:43.600]  toxins so bugs can't eat it exactly but then it's supposedly safe for us well
[02:42:43.600 --> 02:42:48.640]  what happened also is a thanks God I have the the ability to travel to you
[02:42:48.640 --> 02:42:53.280]  know as you know other countries aren't having this autism exactly so that's how
[02:42:53.280 --> 02:42:57.280]  I figure America's cursed that's how I've figured out people people you need to
[02:42:57.280 --> 02:43:01.200]  know these I mean if you go to Costa Rica they people doesn't even know they
[02:43:01.200 --> 02:43:05.800]  don't have the breast cancer at 3,000% up they don't have the autism thousand
[02:43:05.800 --> 02:43:08.960]  autistic no like you don't have the plagues because they don't have Bill
[02:43:08.960 --> 02:43:12.680]  Gates they don't have on Santa but Bill Gates is knocking on the door he's on
[02:43:12.680 --> 02:43:16.480]  their board he's coming though yeah he wants in he wants to help you the
[02:43:16.480 --> 02:43:20.280]  difference is that that they over there people are educated they are fighting
[02:43:20.280 --> 02:43:23.480]  back even when they go no no they're extremist and bad they don't love Bill
[02:43:23.480 --> 02:43:28.040]  Gates they they are they are truly truly fighting back I mean it why don't they
[02:43:28.040 --> 02:43:32.600]  trust Bill Gates he loves them it's a it's a because they don't they want to
[02:43:32.600 --> 02:43:35.840]  die like ever don't they want to be like that makes a big difference don't they
[02:43:35.840 --> 02:43:40.680]  want to die like us no they don't they don't they they they they actually is
[02:43:40.680 --> 02:43:44.480]  very it's very it's pretty pathetic because we've been there in that country
[02:43:44.480 --> 02:43:47.640]  with my husband and sometimes we've said people come on with us to America and
[02:43:47.640 --> 02:43:52.720]  they said what for I mean they true because when you have educated
[02:43:52.720 --> 02:43:56.680]  population and they are content they are happy they don't need to be ultra
[02:43:56.680 --> 02:44:02.240]  mega billionaires when you have a couple of millions you can be happy sure
[02:44:02.240 --> 02:44:06.080]  people been overrun in the third world but and but it but they're even more
[02:44:06.080 --> 02:44:09.480]  away because they've been screwed so much they understand it but I mean
[02:44:09.480 --> 02:44:15.160]  specifically what did you do then to reverse it in your son well by troubling
[02:44:15.160 --> 02:44:19.080]  I start noticing there was a common denominator about the children with
[02:44:19.080 --> 02:44:23.760]  autism and it was it keep pointing me to food food food food and I said what is
[02:44:23.760 --> 02:44:27.320]  in the food and I found out it was this biopesticides oh it's what the White
[02:44:27.320 --> 02:44:33.720]  House science are said yeah actually I was amazed that by the in 1991 when I
[02:44:33.720 --> 02:44:37.840]  was pregnant I'm sorry 2001 when I was pregnant with my son I was eating
[02:44:37.840 --> 02:44:42.320]  Taco Bell I didn't know better and Taco Bell loves you and what happened is
[02:44:42.320 --> 02:44:47.000]  Monsanto at that time they sold they sold a Starling corn that it was not
[02:44:47.000 --> 02:44:50.760]  for human consumption you know they even admit that hurts you but what's wrong
[02:44:50.760 --> 02:44:57.360]  with that well it was in Taco Bell what's wrong with Starling and it kills farm animals why
[02:44:57.360 --> 02:45:01.680]  not eat it Starling admittedly kills people why not die well you guess what
[02:45:01.680 --> 02:45:05.600]  they did if I can show you papers that instead of destroying they give it to
[02:45:05.600 --> 02:45:09.720]  the World Health Organization and they went and they gave it to poor countries
[02:45:09.720 --> 02:45:14.120]  and well they want to help Africa poor people help Africa yeah they gave it to
[02:45:14.120 --> 02:45:18.760]  Costa Rica but Costa Rica has such a educated population they actually
[02:45:18.760 --> 02:45:24.200]  studied and Senate Africa they they they know they actually destroyed it yeah
[02:45:24.200 --> 02:45:27.760]  well the Japanese are destroying it too and they sue back United States for
[02:45:27.760 --> 02:45:31.600]  sending poison to the real Starlink itself she's not just saying that
[02:45:31.600 --> 02:45:36.640]  Starlink they admitted was was was even killing farm animals yeah yeah so that's
[02:45:36.640 --> 02:45:41.560]  what again what's wrong with dying I mean Bill Gates where the creed there's too
[02:45:41.560 --> 02:45:46.080]  many of us what's wrong with just die Bill Gates is better than you know and
[02:45:46.080 --> 02:45:49.840]  another thing is the mainstream media is saying is saying we don't know what
[02:45:49.840 --> 02:45:55.240]  causes autism we don't know we don't know but it's environmental environmental
[02:45:55.240 --> 02:46:02.720]  okay it's environmental hello by a pesticide environment hello the US the
[02:46:02.720 --> 02:46:08.160]  US leaves the world in every type of cancer brain damage lowering IQs obesity
[02:46:08.160 --> 02:46:14.920]  diabetes and then in the rats GMO does that to him and wow two plus two equals
[02:46:14.920 --> 02:46:21.520]  four no wonder scamberg doesn't want your info out let me tell you scamberg he
[02:46:21.520 --> 02:46:27.400]  isn't eating any GMO no no they are eating organic food I mean they can
[02:46:27.400 --> 02:46:31.160]  people can Google these articles you know what's wrong though I mean don't we
[02:46:31.160 --> 02:46:35.920]  want a three thousand where you originally from from Ecuador I why does
[02:46:35.920 --> 02:46:39.600]  an Ecuador want a three thousand percent increase in breast cancer is it that
[02:46:39.600 --> 02:46:44.520]  fun yeah I mean over there they actually the new constitution the the new
[02:46:44.520 --> 02:46:48.640]  president put in the constitution no GMOs allowed in the country in the
[02:46:48.640 --> 02:46:53.080]  Constitution and then Monsanto always gets caught sneaking them in yes because
[02:46:53.080 --> 02:46:57.160]  they want to affect everything because they're nice people really hard so it's
[02:46:57.160 --> 02:47:03.040]  pretty it's pretty sad because people are aware and I believe you see I like to
[02:47:03.040 --> 02:47:07.440]  have a little bit more faith and Americans I've seen people rallying with us
[02:47:07.440 --> 02:47:12.600]  I mean the rally was at least 500 to 1,000 people where I had like 400 plus
[02:47:12.600 --> 02:47:18.280]  rallies no coverage it was not support from the mainstream media so because
[02:47:18.280 --> 02:47:20.840]  they're all told not to let me tell you something but here's how much it changed
[02:47:20.840 --> 02:47:25.240]  he died last year great guy dairy brownfield icon and broadcasting 400
[02:47:25.240 --> 02:47:29.880]  something affiliates he would criticize Monsanto you know he's a major land
[02:47:29.880 --> 02:47:34.720]  owner rich guy sold Learfield communications for a ton of money he was
[02:47:34.720 --> 02:47:38.680]  doing that radio show as he wanted to he was a rich guy you know made his own
[02:47:38.680 --> 02:47:45.600]  money as a rancher up in Missouri more Texan than a Texan this great guy and
[02:47:45.600 --> 02:47:51.840]  he he had a partner in his company and and a lot of this is off record but he's
[02:47:51.840 --> 02:47:54.800]  been dead now for a year and I'm just gonna say this I mean part of it came
[02:47:54.800 --> 02:47:58.440]  out they were told us you can keep your 400 affiliates you can keep all this
[02:47:58.440 --> 02:48:02.280]  money you're making stop talking about Monsanto just mildly they said I'm not
[02:48:02.280 --> 02:48:06.400]  sold off his piece started his own deal to tell the truth and didn't make a big
[02:48:06.400 --> 02:48:10.360]  deal out of it but that's what the kind of stuff Monsanto does now five years
[02:48:10.360 --> 02:48:15.320]  ago they did that the issue is is that now everybody speaking out against them
[02:48:15.320 --> 02:48:18.840]  they used to really try to stop people they can't stop everybody and let me
[02:48:18.840 --> 02:48:21.800]  tell you these reporters that follow orders not to cover it you're gonna
[02:48:21.800 --> 02:48:25.080]  have your kid in a year or two and when they're brain damaged you're gonna get
[02:48:25.080 --> 02:48:28.240]  them off GMO you're gonna become a listener you're gonna know we told you
[02:48:28.240 --> 02:48:32.440]  the truth or maybe you won't fully reverse it I'm sad you won't fully
[02:48:32.440 --> 02:48:37.160]  reverse it from the you know taking the shots in there and the GMO but you'll
[02:48:37.160 --> 02:48:40.320]  reverse part of it and you'll you'll see me on the street and cry this happens
[02:48:40.320 --> 02:48:44.120]  all the time and say oh I got fired after I tried to report but at least my
[02:48:44.120 --> 02:48:47.920]  child can now talk and you'll still grab me and start crying on the side of the
[02:48:47.920 --> 02:48:52.560]  street see I wish you'd listen before you cry because let me tell you this is all
[02:48:52.560 --> 02:48:58.920]  real go ahead exactly I mean I'm tired of hearing the parents over these past ten
[02:48:58.920 --> 02:49:03.560]  years let's create autism awareness autism awareness I'm like we need to
[02:49:03.560 --> 02:49:09.360]  create awareness how to prevent autism same deal it's always it's always find a
[02:49:09.360 --> 02:49:14.040]  cure for breast cancer cut your breast off not why is it exploding it doesn't
[02:49:14.040 --> 02:49:17.640]  make any sense I mean what's wrong with people it's like I went in everywhere I
[02:49:17.640 --> 02:49:21.080]  go which had to give money for prostate cancer breast cancer I'm like well
[02:49:21.080 --> 02:49:24.640]  actually I actually do give money to groups that are you know exposing the
[02:49:24.640 --> 02:49:30.400]  GMO but I mean it's incredible they the groups all make money off killing the
[02:49:30.400 --> 02:49:36.520]  women no and and what up and every time that there is these these epidemic
[02:49:36.520 --> 02:49:45.320]  diseases like autism instead of making groups like big foundations and
[02:49:45.320 --> 02:49:52.000]  making awareness of how to prevent that happen why they keep doing like like
[02:49:52.000 --> 02:49:58.000]  let's make cancer awareness autism awareness diabetes awareness I mean
[02:49:58.000 --> 02:50:03.680]  what's up with the awareness of making people know that people are sick the
[02:50:03.680 --> 02:50:09.080]  awareness should be how to prevent let's make a dare you how dare you reverse
[02:50:09.080 --> 02:50:13.280]  this with your sons how dare you go out of the world trying to warn people how
[02:50:13.280 --> 02:50:16.160]  dare you should be out of you know you're a nice-looking lady you should be out of
[02:50:16.160 --> 02:50:20.200]  a swimming pool posing right now and having fun and being decadent not
[02:50:20.200 --> 02:50:23.800]  caring you could probably have institutionalized your son hell the
[02:50:23.800 --> 02:50:27.600]  center for the bioethics journal says you should just you know now just kill
[02:50:27.600 --> 02:50:31.120]  your son if he was autistic why didn't why don't you try to legalize post birth
[02:50:31.120 --> 02:50:34.600]  abortion you could just kill your sons and once the government legalizes it
[02:50:34.600 --> 02:50:38.120]  that would be the trendy thing to do Alex that would give Bill Gates more
[02:50:38.120 --> 02:50:42.520]  more money and let him run things my neurology you're an extremist not you
[02:50:42.520 --> 02:50:47.560]  should lobby to have shit like Dr. Peter Singer is calling for to kill to have
[02:50:47.560 --> 02:50:50.960]  the government kill autistic children that's what they want that's what they
[02:50:50.960 --> 02:50:53.000]  hope oh no that's the plan they're gonna be showing me that's what they're gonna
[02:50:53.000 --> 02:50:58.880]  do but I mean how dare you we need death and thank you Bill Gates murder me
[02:50:58.880 --> 02:51:04.600]  murder me Bill hi my name is Annette and due to menopause symptoms for nearly
[02:51:04.600 --> 02:51:08.920]  two years I suffered severe hot flashes which prevented me from sleeping all
[02:51:08.920 --> 02:51:13.440]  night it was so hard to work because it continued all day to have the hot flashes
[02:51:13.440 --> 02:51:18.480]  from hell I was exhausted and depleted after only three weeks on one world way
[02:51:18.480 --> 02:51:23.080]  I have no hot flashes and I'm sleeping normally again I feel energized and
[02:51:23.080 --> 02:51:27.600]  strong this is an amazing product it is a little known fact that every single cell
[02:51:27.600 --> 02:51:32.240]  of your body is supposed to produce 10% of its protein content as glutathione but
[02:51:32.240 --> 02:51:36.800]  due to toxicity and aging it does not could glutathione be a missing factor in
[02:51:36.800 --> 02:51:40.920]  optimal cell function for your entire body if you restore the optimal glutathione
[02:51:40.920 --> 02:51:44.720]  levels in your cells especially your glands and organs then as a result your
[02:51:44.720 --> 02:51:48.760]  glands and organs work better imagine the quality of life improvement you might

[02:55:24.760 --> 02:55:29.760]  us give out your websites Facebook all that stuff and talk about briefly how
[02:55:29.760 --> 02:55:32.880]  you reverse it you went and studied that other countries don't have this you
[02:55:32.880 --> 02:55:38.960]  found out what happened how fast did it reverse it in your sons it took me at
[02:55:38.960 --> 02:55:44.080]  least five years to reach the point that my son can actually talk back to me in
[02:55:44.080 --> 02:55:49.880]  sentences on his own it took me five years because I was applying everything
[02:55:49.880 --> 02:55:56.040]  I was learning as it goes so but so when my second son develop autism it was
[02:55:56.040 --> 02:56:01.120]  faster for me because I already knew what to do so actually I was able to help
[02:56:01.120 --> 02:56:06.440]  another mother that has triplets with autism three girls with autism and I
[02:56:06.440 --> 02:56:11.320]  and I thought it was going to be a very difficult task because the girls are
[02:56:11.320 --> 02:56:16.360]  seven years old when they came to to ask me how I did it and how she can do it so
[02:56:16.360 --> 02:56:20.080]  I thought the mother how to do it that's my job that's what I do is I teach
[02:56:20.080 --> 02:56:25.440]  people because that's the only thing the law allows me to do I can I can I can
[02:56:25.440 --> 02:56:30.960]  share my information legally so so I taught her how to do it and she did it
[02:56:30.960 --> 02:56:35.320]  and that was amazing and she was able to reverse the autism and two of her
[02:56:35.320 --> 02:56:40.600]  triplets in like a year and a half and they were substantially recovered so
[02:56:40.600 --> 02:56:45.240]  they can go back to school and attend regular setting and the third one it had
[02:56:45.240 --> 02:56:50.960]  a slower piece and a pace I'm sorry and then but she continued to recover you
[02:56:50.960 --> 02:56:57.000]  see the recovery rate on each kid is different you can because it depends of
[02:56:57.000 --> 02:57:02.200]  how much damage has been caused by the biopasas how many epigenetic changes
[02:57:02.200 --> 02:57:09.880]  those children have you see autism it's an intracellular damage and it's not
[02:57:09.880 --> 02:57:14.200]  impossible to reverse that but it takes a lot of effort and we shouldn't have to
[02:57:14.200 --> 02:57:18.000]  go through all the trouble to avoid this it should be illegal everywhere we're
[02:57:18.000 --> 02:57:22.400]  not crossing some plants or something they're growing pesticide in them well
[02:57:22.400 --> 02:57:27.480]  Alex if you're Christian like many people are and you understand that God
[02:57:27.480 --> 02:57:33.600]  wrote in the Bible that he doesn't want us to destroy his creation don't mix the
[02:57:33.600 --> 02:57:37.720]  seed don't mix the seed this written in the Bible I think this is the original
[02:57:37.720 --> 02:57:41.840]  sin is the worst possible thing the humans can do is crossing species this
[02:57:41.840 --> 02:57:47.200]  is a natural laws that God established we should respect this okay a stop of
[02:57:47.200 --> 02:57:52.160]  offending God a stop is enough Monsanto thinks it's God and look at the
[02:57:52.160 --> 02:57:57.320]  abominations it's building well let's let's be fair and it's not just Monsanto
[02:57:57.320 --> 02:58:03.440]  it's Sanjenta is due point it's is down I mean I know I promised my husband not
[02:58:03.440 --> 02:58:08.440]  to mention names but we gotta talk I mean this is enough our kids are being
[02:58:08.440 --> 02:58:12.880]  killed I don't see the difference from having a child without profoundly
[02:58:12.880 --> 02:58:17.440]  autistic and and a child that you lose that he dies well I mean the studies
[02:58:17.440 --> 02:58:21.120]  are there that with a lot of these GMOs it's hurting the roads and then we know
[02:58:21.120 --> 02:58:25.000]  our numbers are exploding it's vaccines it's a lot of stuff and absolutely it's
[02:58:25.000 --> 02:58:28.800]  time to go all the way against these people and and if they want to fight
[02:58:28.800 --> 02:58:33.560]  they're gonna get one because they are assaulting us they gave us Agent Orange
[02:58:33.560 --> 02:58:36.240]  what is their next they're gonna tell us that's good we'll be right back

[03:00:18.200 --> 03:00:26.560]  live from Austin Texas Alex Jones Andrea Lalama is our guest and she's here to be
[03:00:26.560 --> 03:00:32.480]  interviewed tonight by Mike Adams is hosting info wars nightly news to find
[03:00:32.480 --> 03:00:36.440]  Showtime's info streams all of that at prisonplanet.tv coming up the next
[03:00:36.440 --> 03:00:40.280]  segment I'd forgotten she's the lady that went and got tests done the epigenetics
[03:00:40.280 --> 03:00:44.480]  Monsanto came in with threats I mean this is just amazing and like she said
[03:00:44.480 --> 03:00:49.600]  you know Monsanto is not the only group it is Monsanto is just now kind of like
[03:00:49.600 --> 03:00:54.080]  saying search engines or Google it's kind of the the term you use just to
[03:00:54.080 --> 03:00:59.400]  describe genetic engineering but but getting more into traveling around the
[03:00:59.400 --> 03:01:04.280]  world what will people find on your website holistic approach for autism.com
[03:01:04.280 --> 03:01:10.160]  well in the website I describe my experience with my children how they
[03:01:10.160 --> 03:01:16.400]  develop autism how they recovered I also put a lot of my hypothesis a lot of my
[03:01:16.400 --> 03:01:21.200]  research is there people can find out how I discovered to help my son with
[03:01:21.200 --> 03:01:26.840]  natural herbs and and and extracts and and things that truly truly work and they
[03:01:26.840 --> 03:01:30.680]  wouldn't harm the children because when my son got diagnosed the first thing I
[03:01:30.680 --> 03:01:35.320]  was offered by my neurologist was Ritalin concerta I mean and you name it
[03:01:35.320 --> 03:01:40.160]  just pharmaceutical drugs to dope my son because they that makes the brain
[03:01:40.160 --> 03:01:44.760]  shrink the heart expand exactly lowers IQ what's wrong with that I asked I asked
[03:01:44.760 --> 03:01:49.360]  them I said is this is this is this stuff gonna cure him and I said no but
[03:01:49.360 --> 03:01:54.720]  he's gonna be manageable I'm like I don't want to manage him I want to cure
[03:01:54.720 --> 03:01:59.000]  him he wasn't born that way I have footage video that can prove it to you
[03:01:59.000 --> 03:02:03.920]  that my son was developing normally until he got these five shots of one the
[03:02:03.920 --> 03:02:08.040]  trigger his autism because you see once you're a pigeon once you have
[03:02:08.040 --> 03:02:13.280]  epigenetic changes by this poison by this pesticides in your food then all you
[03:02:13.280 --> 03:02:18.080]  need it's it's these triggers like vaccines that are more poison that your
[03:02:18.080 --> 03:02:24.200]  body can defend from it anymore you can create antibodies you can detoxify
[03:02:24.200 --> 03:02:29.240]  from the mercury you all these pathways that we have inside are broken and
[03:02:29.240 --> 03:02:33.480]  that's why our kids are developing autism and and that is been proven with
[03:02:33.480 --> 03:02:39.600]  genetic testing so I was trying to to prove this at that time hypothesis
[03:02:39.600 --> 03:02:44.440]  based on research of course but hypothesis because I have not been able
[03:02:44.440 --> 03:02:48.760]  to take my son to a lab and getting tested and said and prove the world and
[03:02:48.760 --> 03:02:53.920]  say hey here it is you see I show you so what happened is I contact three
[03:02:53.920 --> 03:02:59.400]  different laboratories and I try to do that trust me I fought so hard to prove
[03:02:59.400 --> 03:03:02.440]  people that our kids have been hurt by this but they'd already been called you
[03:03:02.440 --> 03:03:07.280]  don't test these kids we love you exactly I mean we're gonna tell the story
[03:03:07.280 --> 03:03:11.000]  when we come back from break but I give people a kind of an idea of what
[03:03:11.000 --> 03:03:16.200]  happened well they are freaked out that's basically the point I mean
[03:03:16.200 --> 03:03:21.920]  laboratories are intimidated but who knows who that we cannot even test our
[03:03:21.920 --> 03:03:27.880]  children's the stools or blood for to find if they have BT toxin or pesticides
[03:03:27.880 --> 03:03:32.480]  in their system because that's patented just like the breast cancer gene you
[03:03:32.480 --> 03:03:37.160]  can not touch it you cannot investigate this stuff but that's bull I mean I mean
[03:03:37.160 --> 03:03:40.920]  they can say the poison well it was kind of like their crops infect other crops you
[03:03:40.920 --> 03:03:45.000]  prove you bought your seeds they infected you but the court rules against you now
[03:03:45.000 --> 03:03:48.720]  you want to show that it's in your child's bloodstream you know these
[03:03:48.720 --> 03:03:52.120]  chemicals and things and they say that's our chemical you can't test for it I
[03:03:52.120 --> 03:03:56.160]  mean that that's a total violation of common law that's terrible like if
[03:03:56.160 --> 03:03:59.680]  somebody patented cyanide and then you were poisoned whether you can't test for
[03:03:59.680 --> 03:04:04.000]  cyanide now and when you go to other foreign countries to do these tests like
[03:04:04.000 --> 03:04:09.760]  I'm I was thinking to do then is completely denied here in the United
[03:04:09.760 --> 03:04:13.720]  States you know as soon as I will if I do something like that they will they
[03:04:13.720 --> 03:04:17.960]  will start discrediting because it's not officially made but tell me what what
[03:04:17.960 --> 03:04:21.840]  the one test you did get done dead it can't mention the name of the grip when
[03:04:21.840 --> 03:04:25.400]  we come back but ladies and gentlemen the system is I should appear and joke
[03:04:25.400 --> 03:04:29.200]  about this because it actually hurts me it's gallows humor there's no doubt we're
[03:04:29.200 --> 03:04:32.920]  under a plague there's no doubt we've had 53 million abortions there's no doubt
[03:04:32.920 --> 03:04:37.760]  we've gone from 125,000 with autism to 150 something there's no doubt cancer
[03:04:37.760 --> 03:04:41.480]  rates are all exploding there's no doubt diabetes is exploding there's no doubt
[03:04:41.480 --> 03:04:45.280]  that whatever's going on whether it's on purpose or not is hurting us and we
[03:04:45.280 --> 03:04:48.800]  know it's on purpose the globalists are eugenicists they're obsessed that you
[03:04:48.800 --> 03:04:54.040]  know the these big GMO companies on record don't serve their own stuff in
[03:04:54.040 --> 03:04:57.840]  their own cafeterias their scientists won't eat it because they're eugenicists

[03:08:18.560 --> 03:08:23.720]  all right ladies and gentlemen Andrea Lalama a mother who heads up holistic
[03:08:23.720 --> 03:08:29.040]  approach for autism.com you know she's one of the I'd say top 10 people out
[03:08:29.040 --> 03:08:34.880]  their mothers really leading the fight exposing that there's hydrofluorosalic
[03:08:34.880 --> 03:08:40.680]  acid in the water there's GMO in the food that grows its own pesticides now
[03:08:40.680 --> 03:08:44.760]  there's major studies that have come out just recently saying it is epigenetic it
[03:08:44.760 --> 03:08:50.240]  is getting into the DNA it is leaking out of the gut no kidding I mean I saw an
[03:08:50.240 --> 03:08:54.040]  article in the Washington Post last year I covered probably five times on air it
[03:08:54.040 --> 03:08:59.040]  had a headline where farmers are violating GMO planting rules and not
[03:08:59.040 --> 03:09:04.200]  planting a refuge for the bees and insects so that they'll have something
[03:09:04.200 --> 03:09:11.680]  to eat not all die I mean they spray sodium fluoride on the crops to kill the
[03:09:11.680 --> 03:09:18.280]  bugs it bioaccumulates what's a cocktail so the vaccines go over the top and then
[03:09:18.280 --> 03:09:23.240]  you add all this other stuff into it it is a cocktail and they know this is
[03:09:23.240 --> 03:09:28.200]  going on the globalist they avoid it let's turn her mic on so in this segment
[03:09:28.200 --> 03:09:32.440]  I'm gonna give you the floor break down what you discovered the mercury how it
[03:09:32.440 --> 03:09:37.240]  all ties together what's going on the labs you went to to get it tested and
[03:09:37.240 --> 03:09:43.120]  what Monsanto did break it down well basically our old mighty helped me by
[03:09:43.120 --> 03:09:49.320]  letting me see the bees dying in my backyard I suddenly I had hundreds and
[03:09:49.320 --> 03:09:53.200]  hundreds of bees coming and dying in my backyard and I was like what is going
[03:09:53.200 --> 03:09:58.000]  on so I started researching about the bees and I discovered they have these
[03:09:58.000 --> 03:10:04.000]  neurotransmitters called octopamine and I thought what if the humans also have
[03:10:04.000 --> 03:10:08.400]  these octopamine and and our children has it and they are being affected by
[03:10:08.400 --> 03:10:13.080]  this so I really I contact a couple of scientists friends of mine and they said
[03:10:13.080 --> 03:10:17.120]  you know Andrea I never heard about it I never knew about it and I tried I went
[03:10:17.120 --> 03:10:21.760]  to UCLA medical center they're just trying to put it on screen and I was
[03:10:21.760 --> 03:10:25.120]  trying to get them to shrink it there is people can go to they can just type
[03:10:25.120 --> 03:10:32.280]  reversing autism one word all together and he will send them to my page which
[03:10:32.280 --> 03:10:35.560]  is holistic approach for us keep going keep going they can they can read there
[03:10:35.560 --> 03:10:40.240]  that octopamine is a neurotransmitter that is actually the the main neurotransmitter
[03:10:40.240 --> 03:10:46.440]  the bees use for communication the bees weren't dying the CCD the colony collapse
[03:10:46.440 --> 03:10:50.480]  disorder basically is that the bees go forging and they never come back home
[03:10:50.480 --> 03:10:54.920]  and that's how I see autism our kids and I was reading you develop this theory
[03:10:54.920 --> 03:10:58.600]  even before the German University did and they've now found in several studies
[03:10:58.600 --> 03:11:03.680]  that indeed certain types of BT corn are directly linked to the bees just not
[03:11:03.680 --> 03:11:08.400]  knowing where they are and exactly the bees don't is autism I'm sorry but the
[03:11:08.400 --> 03:11:12.640]  bees are getting autism no they're not sure it's the same is the same pattern
[03:11:12.640 --> 03:11:17.720]  so that's why I believe God was in my side because when I started studying the
[03:11:17.720 --> 03:11:23.720]  bees that hasn't I I kept an open mind I was not trying to make my hypothesis to
[03:11:23.720 --> 03:11:28.520]  fit and and find something to corroborate what I was thinking I totally went
[03:11:28.520 --> 03:11:33.320]  with a brain totally blank and and not thinking about what I'm gonna find just
[03:11:33.320 --> 03:11:39.640]  research research and research and I find out that the biopesticides needed to
[03:11:39.640 --> 03:11:45.240]  fool the bees to eat the biopesticides because the bees are so smart that a few
[03:11:45.240 --> 03:11:49.680]  got sick they went back to the colony and says don't go there that feels full of
[03:11:49.680 --> 03:11:54.600]  poison but also smarter than us absolutely and what happened is not
[03:11:54.600 --> 03:11:59.280]  just the bees were doing that but other farm animals won't eat GMO other other
[03:11:59.280 --> 03:12:04.560]  other my other insects were doing the same thing so what these the
[03:12:04.560 --> 03:12:07.560]  corporations that are doing biopesticides are doing is they create
[03:12:07.560 --> 03:12:13.880]  these mercury fungicides and mercury pesticides to make them kind of like
[03:12:13.880 --> 03:12:19.160]  drunk so when they when the insects fly to the field they get first drunk and
[03:12:19.160 --> 03:12:23.760]  then they get the biopesticide so that's what the fluoride does to us that makes
[03:12:23.760 --> 03:12:27.400]  us drunk and then they kill us so we don't notice very loving is another
[03:12:27.400 --> 03:12:31.720]  killing us the same way I mean very loving yeah the correlation of what
[03:12:31.720 --> 03:12:34.480]  they are doing to the insects to what they are doing to our children it's
[03:12:34.480 --> 03:12:38.520]  horrible it's exactly the same thing so what happened is that when once they
[03:12:38.520 --> 03:12:42.560]  bees get all these mercury and then they get intoxicated by acetrin as one of
[03:12:42.560 --> 03:12:48.400]  the ones I use they can read the whole the in detail with the chemical names
[03:12:48.400 --> 03:12:53.360]  and what I found it and with references and everything and then they lose this
[03:12:53.360 --> 03:12:56.200]  octopamine which is the main neurotransmitter for communication so
[03:12:56.200 --> 03:12:59.640]  when they come back to their home they feel that they make it they can't
[03:12:59.640 --> 03:13:03.480]  communicate to the other bees that something is happening just like YouTube
[03:13:03.480 --> 03:13:07.840]  now breaks us into subgroups so we can't communicate well it's dumbest down
[03:13:07.840 --> 03:13:13.000]  lock us down starts hardcore soft killing don't let us communicate yeah you
[03:13:13.000 --> 03:13:16.440]  see when you see it when you have a normal child like me Alex and you see
[03:13:16.440 --> 03:13:20.160]  this child out of the blue is start losing its words the words that he was
[03:13:20.160 --> 03:13:23.880]  speaking before you know what it is for me not to hear my son calling me mom
[03:13:23.880 --> 03:13:29.480]  ever again he couldn't even say mom wow okay he lost that he lost that he
[03:13:29.480 --> 03:13:34.960]  couldn't ask for food he was a starving and he couldn't say I'm hungry and then
[03:13:34.960 --> 03:13:39.240]  and then well Andrea there's too many people we got to do something that's
[03:13:39.240 --> 03:13:43.720]  what I'm here that's what I'm here for I really appreciate you supporting but I'm
[03:13:43.720 --> 03:13:46.920]  playing the part of Bill Gates there's too many people you know we've got to get
[03:13:46.920 --> 03:13:51.200]  rid of your children and my answer is how about how about he get yeah well how
[03:13:51.200 --> 03:13:55.360]  about Bill Gates gets off the planet exactly die you know he could with all
[03:13:55.360 --> 03:13:59.000]  the money he has he can he can make his own little rocket and send himself to
[03:13:59.000 --> 03:14:04.920]  living Marne that's a good idea actually like a phantom zone General Zodd keep
[03:14:04.920 --> 03:14:09.080]  going all these elites should do that just just go with the leads I think
[03:14:09.080 --> 03:14:14.600]  they're actually planning that at least you know we would be so much happier if
[03:14:14.600 --> 03:14:17.760]  they just take a rocket and go to the freaking moon I bet you the moon is
[03:14:17.760 --> 03:14:21.240]  gonna spit them out I mean it is the real proof is they've all written books
[03:14:21.240 --> 03:14:25.200]  bragging they would do this 30 40 years ago now they're doing it they're here
[03:14:25.200 --> 03:14:28.160]  and everywhere they're in control this is happening where they're not in
[03:14:28.160 --> 03:14:32.800]  control it's not happening well I mean Amish you won't do this no autism people
[03:14:32.800 --> 03:14:37.480]  eating the GMO take on the shots total autism exactly exactly so well keep
[03:14:37.480 --> 03:14:40.920]  going what you found tell us about the people you try to get test well what
[03:14:40.920 --> 03:14:47.520]  happened is after I find out all these answers for for my child I start putting
[03:14:47.520 --> 03:14:53.480]  on the internet I created Yahoo group hell group reversing autism and the
[03:14:53.480 --> 03:14:56.720]  mothers there says oh please Andrea what we do and I start sharing and I said
[03:14:56.720 --> 03:15:00.640]  listen we need to prove that our kids has this help me out there's a lot that is
[03:15:00.640 --> 03:15:04.680]  willing to test our kids so I said all right we wait for them to call us back
[03:15:04.680 --> 03:15:08.720]  two weeks went by they didn't call me back so I put the mothers come on moms
[03:15:08.720 --> 03:15:14.600]  you rock help me here call this is the number fill the answer machine make
[03:15:14.600 --> 03:15:18.280]  them call us back and explain to us why they are not testing our kids like they
[03:15:18.280 --> 03:15:24.160]  agree to do it so the mother's rock you see autistic mothers with autistic kids
[03:15:24.160 --> 03:15:27.360]  will do anything they're battling back against the general sod so what happened
[03:15:27.360 --> 03:15:31.600]  it well the laboratory coming back and off the record that's why I'm not
[03:15:31.600 --> 03:15:35.720]  mentioning their name they off the record they say Andrea Monsanto said that
[03:15:35.720 --> 03:15:39.760]  these belongs to them to is their patents we cannot test your son for these
[03:15:39.760 --> 03:15:43.320]  proteins in himself we could get in a legal bottle so they put it in the
[03:15:43.320 --> 03:15:46.120]  food they know and studies the people have done the test now people done the
[03:15:46.120 --> 03:15:50.800]  studies well it's leaking out and they say you can't test for our poison in
[03:15:50.800 --> 03:15:54.720]  your child exactly what a load of bull poison you and you cannot test to prove
[03:15:54.720 --> 03:15:59.520]  that the poison isn't you how's that so you can because they said so exactly and
[03:15:59.520 --> 03:16:03.080]  this is was before even they passed this law that now they are protected from
[03:16:03.080 --> 03:16:07.360]  any sue this was before that I'm just like the vaccine makers about and said
[03:16:07.360 --> 03:16:10.960]  we'll carry out this operation but give us liability protection yeah imagine I'm
[03:16:10.960 --> 03:16:15.640]  chasing them since 2006 and I don't want money and I don't want nothing I just
[03:16:15.640 --> 03:16:20.680]  want them to to to stop hurting other children there's too many people on
[03:16:20.680 --> 03:16:26.080]  radio is yes I mean they're trying to help us absolutely I do I'm doing for my
[03:16:26.080 --> 03:16:30.320]  kids I promise them to make pay whoever caused this to them and I will until my
[03:16:30.320 --> 03:16:35.440]  aunt to the teeth I mean wow you mean you're gonna defend yourself that sounds
[03:16:35.440 --> 03:16:42.360]  even more extreme oh they they have no idea when two words roll over give in to
[03:16:42.360 --> 03:16:47.280]  them Henry Kissinger said use food as a weapon these stabilized countries murder
[03:16:47.280 --> 03:16:51.920]  people in mass it's wrong with that Henry Kissinger is a beautiful person he
[03:16:51.920 --> 03:16:56.240]  deserves to live you and your family don't you want to thank him for all he's
[03:16:56.240 --> 03:17:00.640]  done tell you he's an ugly man I mean oh he doesn't need to be replicated please
[03:17:00.640 --> 03:17:06.920]  don't man you know we call him a super mass murderer potato head you know yeah
[03:17:06.920 --> 03:17:13.720]  he's he's pretty ugly and so if something tried to try to replicate the
[03:17:13.720 --> 03:17:17.680]  beautiful people not just outside but inside and he's ugly both ways inside
[03:17:17.680 --> 03:17:24.240]  out so this time the book that the cover does match the book well we need to we
[03:17:24.240 --> 03:17:29.600]  need to start the as a community and the reason I'm here for today is I beg
[03:17:29.600 --> 03:17:34.480]  these mothers that are listening to me right now doing this interview to get
[03:17:34.480 --> 03:17:39.600]  united and stop with the baloney and get united and let's stop consuming GMOs
[03:17:39.600 --> 03:17:43.680]  we could totally destroy them oh yeah Monsanto last week was saying be nice
[03:17:43.680 --> 03:17:48.920]  stop back off no like yeah like the hell 9,000 when they're turning it off if we
[03:17:48.920 --> 03:17:53.000]  just don't buy their stuff it's over we vote with our dollars exactly that's why
[03:17:53.000 --> 03:17:56.720]  they want to bankrupt everybody so that everybody's so poor they can only get the
[03:17:56.720 --> 03:18:00.720]  stuff they'll basically give you for free well they do give you for free you
[03:18:00.720 --> 03:18:05.560]  know it's insane but certain groups that like I told you the World Health
[03:18:05.560 --> 03:18:08.840]  Organization got the Starlink instead of destroying it when I gave it to the
[03:18:08.840 --> 03:18:11.560]  poor people in Central America the World Health Organization has been caught in
[03:18:11.560 --> 03:18:17.080]  India and Africa and in South America going and adding a sterile into the
[03:18:17.080 --> 03:18:22.160]  vaccines this is on record yeah and no and it's more ugly that that movie stars
[03:18:22.160 --> 03:18:26.400]  in Hollywood at supporting this I had my RPD attrition who owned one of these
[03:18:26.400 --> 03:18:34.160]  now retired I he on the biggest pediatrician clinic in Austin and they
[03:18:34.160 --> 03:18:37.960]  would do they would not do vaccines if you wanted but they did vaccines as well
[03:18:37.960 --> 03:18:41.520]  and he called me aside I won't say his name he said let me tell you something you
[03:18:41.520 --> 03:18:46.080]  know we're supposed to continue education you know do some charity stuff
[03:18:46.080 --> 03:18:51.280]  at the East Austin clinics and he goes I refuse to do it but he goes they were
[03:18:51.280 --> 03:18:59.480]  giving him 1960s liquid you know the batch numbers with SV 40 cancer well to
[03:18:59.480 --> 03:19:02.480]  the East Austin kids I said you got to go public and he goes he goes you're a
[03:19:02.480 --> 03:19:06.320]  journalist he grabbed by the arm he goes I just told you that off record you can
[03:19:06.320 --> 03:19:09.360]  say you were told that by a doctor in Austin but you don't say that I had my
[03:19:09.360 --> 03:19:13.040]  arm it's like a well-known doctor but there's probably thousand people
[03:19:13.040 --> 03:19:16.120]  listening the kids went to him and I said well you got to tell people when he
[03:19:16.120 --> 03:19:20.320]  said nope just like Dr. Privilege your journalist privilege you will you do not
[03:19:20.320 --> 03:19:23.800]  repeat that you know they came from me that's the same thing that all these
[03:19:23.800 --> 03:19:28.120]  years I've been dealing with Alex they give the kids in East Austin cancer yes
[03:19:28.120 --> 03:19:33.320]  SV 40 will give you cancer I don't know what the American people are waiting for
[03:19:33.320 --> 03:19:37.520]  I mean at this point they are destroying our children what else you want them to
[03:19:37.520 --> 03:19:42.280]  take away from you I I wouldn't even care if they would have told me give me

[03:24:18.320 --> 03:24:21.880]  here's an article that was in the prairie advocate news they posted a blurb of it
[03:24:21.880 --> 03:24:27.360]  up on planet info wars.com this happened two days ago bees resistant to
[03:24:27.360 --> 03:24:31.160]  monsanto a roundup illegally seized by the Illinois Ag Department they claim
[03:24:31.160 --> 03:24:34.920]  roundups not even meant to kill bees because of course it does because the
[03:24:34.920 --> 03:24:37.880]  people want them pollinating but somebody goes wow these bees aren't dying
[03:24:37.880 --> 03:24:41.880]  because you know insects will become resistant and immune oh my gosh they
[03:24:41.880 --> 03:24:47.000]  seized them saying it's the property of Monsanto so I guess it'd be like if they
[03:24:47.000 --> 03:24:50.640]  patented lead and I shot you in the head instead of me getting arrested that
[03:24:50.640 --> 03:24:54.760]  they arrest the corpse and say because it has lead in it and so oh my god don't
[03:24:54.760 --> 03:24:57.240]  want the people to find out what's happening here you're not gonna be able
[03:24:57.240 --> 03:25:00.400]  to stop all the bees from coming you know stopping you they're gonna become
[03:25:00.400 --> 03:25:04.560]  resist just like humans are and but but you know what happened to the German
[03:25:04.560 --> 03:25:08.280]  scientists and others they do not want you looking at what they're doing to you
[03:25:08.280 --> 03:25:12.920]  I mean why are the courts doing this because they own them well it's it's
[03:25:12.920 --> 03:25:18.320]  it's horrible this is a totally conspiracy against humanity because it
[03:25:18.320 --> 03:25:23.360]  was this Dr. Cass this German scientist who was actually conducting and
[03:25:23.360 --> 03:25:29.640]  dissecting the bees intestines and you it was all over the internet when I got
[03:25:29.640 --> 03:25:34.400]  this information luckily I saved it and I printed and I and I and I saved it on
[03:25:34.400 --> 03:25:38.680]  my hard drives now you can't find it anymore because Monsanto owns the big
[03:25:38.680 --> 03:25:43.360]  guy's internet they own the big guy's he actually proved that these bees were
[03:25:43.360 --> 03:25:48.120]  dying because they had a lot of anti-gestive and digested
[03:25:48.120 --> 03:25:56.400]  proteins from these BT crops and and and it was causing leaky gut to the just
[03:25:56.400 --> 03:26:01.520]  like we're seeing incredible intestinal disorder skyrocket exactly and Monsanto
[03:26:01.520 --> 03:26:05.120]  has now bought leading bee research firm everything implicated in bee colony
[03:26:05.120 --> 03:26:09.840]  collapse exactly but there's nothing going on no and again you look at Monsanto
[03:26:09.840 --> 03:26:13.840]  they're famous eugenics operation and and and just everything else you can
[03:26:13.840 --> 03:26:19.160]  imagine and people refute me and said oh no you cannot blame by your past but
[03:26:19.160 --> 03:26:26.320]  but GMOs because they were introduced in 1996 for human consumption autism has
[03:26:26.320 --> 03:26:31.760]  been there since 1942 I'm like skyrocketing excuse me do a better research
[03:26:31.760 --> 03:26:35.720]  okay don't defeat me on something that I became an expert on because of my son
[03:26:35.720 --> 03:26:42.920]  biopastas has been on our field since 1929 and I can prove it to you isn't it
[03:26:42.920 --> 03:26:47.440]  isn't my website the the reference on the book that I actually fought a copy
[03:26:47.440 --> 03:26:52.880]  before they probably disappeared the book from the from the public library and
[03:26:52.880 --> 03:26:57.400]  in LA books don't exist as a conspiracy in closing you were pointing out though
[03:26:57.400 --> 03:27:01.520]  it's all sorts of other health problems it's not just the autism exactly so
[03:27:01.520 --> 03:27:06.200]  people that are listening to this interview and they think oh boring is
[03:27:06.200 --> 03:27:09.800]  not my son doesn't have autism so I shouldn't listen to this then listen
[03:27:09.800 --> 03:27:14.080]  and then look at your kids again and why they have so many allergies to food
[03:27:14.080 --> 03:27:18.520]  maybe haven't you asked that maybe the answer is in the food not in your child
[03:27:18.520 --> 03:27:22.520]  why are people more and more allergic to everything exactly and and why they
[03:27:22.520 --> 03:27:27.920]  keep saying oh your kid is allergic take take a leg or whatever no throw away
[03:27:27.920 --> 03:27:31.160]  that food and give the food yeah it's like oh you're allergic turn off your
[03:27:31.160 --> 03:27:35.080]  immune system no and then you turn your immune system off you get cancer no they
[03:27:35.080 --> 03:27:39.520]  say if you are allergic is because of you you're you're you're oh now they're
[03:27:39.520 --> 03:27:42.680]  saying women are all getting breast cancer because they have bad genes your
[03:27:42.680 --> 03:27:46.240]  grandmother had the same genes that didn't get breast cancer exactly but yes
[03:27:46.240 --> 03:27:50.320]  you have the genes that when they put pesticides in your food you die all these
[03:27:50.320 --> 03:27:54.440]  all these diseases that our children are having they are turning around and
[03:27:54.440 --> 03:27:58.400]  blaming on the parents oh I've had all the scientists on what happens to guinea
[03:27:58.400 --> 03:28:03.360]  pigs rats and pigs in in double-blind studies given these cross-PCs BT type the
[03:28:03.360 --> 03:28:07.080]  whole spectrum is the same thing happening to humans the difference is they
[03:28:07.080 --> 03:28:11.120]  have a generation every year so we have it every 20 by the third or fourth
[03:28:11.120 --> 03:28:15.280]  generation that they're almost all sterile dead deformed exactly my god how
[03:28:15.280 --> 03:28:19.120]  are they gonna cover this up in another 20 years though when when hat when like a
[03:28:19.120 --> 03:28:24.280]  genius can walk a genius can talk listen I another thing that it really
[03:28:24.280 --> 03:28:28.960]  bothers me is that these mainstream media and the people that that support
[03:28:28.960 --> 03:28:33.680]  these companies keep saying the population that we have
[03:28:33.680 --> 03:28:38.680]  scientific studies we I mean are the population an idiot let's just say
[03:28:38.680 --> 03:28:43.320]  study study fluoride's good for you if somebody with a white coat tells you
[03:28:43.320 --> 03:28:48.040]  something that is every year they say there are no side effects from
[03:28:48.040 --> 03:28:51.640]  vaccines and then you read the insert and says it can kill you yeah they're
[03:28:51.640 --> 03:28:57.320]  lying and what matters with autistic kids have done is go to the books grab a
[03:28:57.320 --> 03:29:01.680]  damn book I mean you can do it they've got mad scientists that are eugenicists
[03:29:01.680 --> 03:29:05.920]  that founded all these companies that are designing Trojan horse weapons
[03:29:05.920 --> 03:29:10.400]  systems do you have any doubt this is on purpose absolutely absolutely you think
[03:29:10.400 --> 03:29:16.040]  it's all purpose oh yeah I have this I trace it to who invented these BT talks
[03:29:16.040 --> 03:29:20.600]  and all the way to the Nazis in Germany they were getting prepared for the they
[03:29:20.600 --> 03:29:24.480]  were getting prepared for the for the world and they started with the chemical
[03:29:24.480 --> 03:29:27.120]  no that's right they said they're gonna take over and then feed people poison
[03:29:27.120 --> 03:29:30.120]  food so they wouldn't know who was killing them because people resist if you
[03:29:30.120 --> 03:29:32.280]  line them up and shoot them you're actually you're correct again what
[03:29:32.280 --> 03:29:35.360]  happened is they the war ended and they didn't know what to do with this so now
[03:29:35.360 --> 03:29:39.280]  what they did is they saw to America to dilute it and use it as because the
[03:29:39.280 --> 03:29:43.320]  Nazis actually came from eugenicists here they were just coming back home all
[03:29:43.320 --> 03:29:47.040]  right folks can check out your website holistic approach for autism.com
