[00:00.000 --> 00:12.160]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does
[00:12.160 --> 00:19.680]  he he's alex jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[00:19.680 --> 00:30.520]  Alex Jones well I told everybody give me some time for the facts to start
[00:30.520 --> 00:34.160]  coming out and I'll tell you whether I think this was a false flag or
[00:34.160 --> 00:39.760]  specifically what type of false flag it was the Paris situation the New York
[00:39.760 --> 00:47.880]  Times had that headline a few years ago the FBI hatching terror plots and other
[00:47.880 --> 00:51.600]  agencies of government have been caught doing this other agencies and other
[00:51.600 --> 00:58.280]  governments have been caught doing it and we now know that the three shooters
[00:58.280 --> 01:09.180]  were being handled by the known double triple agent of al-qaeda working for some
[01:09.180 --> 01:16.360]  of the crooks at the Pentagon and war a la laki and that is now in mainstream news
[01:16.360 --> 01:24.040]  and that one of the shooters from the Paris attacks lived with mutalib the
[01:24.040 --> 01:30.080]  biggest patsy in the known universe drugged put on the flight with no ID
[01:30.080 --> 01:36.000]  no visa passport came out congressional testimony that an unnamed US agency
[01:36.000 --> 01:42.480]  pressured the Dutch to get him on the plane in Amsterdam in its flight bound
[01:42.480 --> 01:49.840]  into Detroit Michigan we of course broke that first with the lawyers that were
[01:49.840 --> 01:52.520]  witnesses to it the husband and wife lawyers we had Kurt Haskell on the
[01:52.520 --> 01:56.720]  broadcast and then months later on C-spam we have that clip coming up it was
[01:56.720 --> 02:02.800]  confirmed what he saw the sharp graphs man arguing when mutalib didn't have
[02:02.800 --> 02:08.680]  IDs and getting him on the plane I mean this is ridiculous clearly drugged out
[02:08.680 --> 02:15.240]  of his gourd probably on an amnesic like Halcyon feds could grab me give me three
[02:15.240 --> 02:20.320]  four Halcyon put a firecracker bomb in my pants put me on a plane and they'd
[02:20.320 --> 02:26.760]  say Alex Jones is a underwear bomber they could do it to you Halcyon's the
[02:26.760 --> 02:29.280]  drug they give you when they pull your wisdom teeth out just one of the many
[02:29.280 --> 02:34.080]  amnesics where you'll be enjoying it while they do it and if you tell somebody
[02:34.080 --> 02:39.120]  on a good dose of Halcyon to cut their fingers off with a hatchet they'll do it
[02:39.120 --> 02:46.560]  okay the toilet was probably drugged on Halcyon or something like it and it's
[02:46.560 --> 02:53.200]  real simple how this works and so is it a pure false flag where you totally stage
[02:53.200 --> 02:59.280]  it and blame it on somebody no it is a synthetic false flag they even put out
[02:59.280 --> 03:03.560]  that computer-generated deal where it mutalib looked like Obi-Wan Kenobi he had
[03:03.560 --> 03:08.160]  the hood over his head and then he turns and the face has clearly been edited in
[03:08.160 --> 03:14.360]  it's not even good CG it's not even good computer animation it's like they get
[03:14.360 --> 03:19.800]  lazy like the first Lord of the Rings was so good it was epic and good acting
[03:19.800 --> 03:26.960]  good battles was it a bunch of CG now I saw the third Hobbit and I've seen World
[03:26.960 --> 03:30.000]  of Warcraft played online I've seen the clips of it on YouTube and other games
[03:30.000 --> 03:33.920]  it I guarantee you they use that program when they show the battles it's just
[03:33.920 --> 03:39.160]  simulated computer and like a video game like Donkey Kong or something I've got
[03:39.160 --> 03:44.960]  the dwarves killing goblins killing orcs and it's just it's just incredible it's
[03:44.960 --> 03:49.600]  the same thing here it's like when the Pentagon got caught this the office of
[03:49.600 --> 03:55.760]  special plans about eight years ago putting out a fake Adam Gadan son of
[03:55.760 --> 04:05.120]  the ADL founder a grandson video about a tax and it was put out the Pentagon
[04:05.120 --> 04:12.200]  group put its seal on it in the same a layer as the alkytographic and Wired
[04:12.200 --> 04:16.840]  magazine talked about one of the tech experts on the top ones in the world saw
[04:16.840 --> 04:21.160]  that did an analysis folks we can do that here we'd already pointed that out
[04:21.160 --> 04:25.880]  before we can go into the layers of a video and tell you when things were
[04:25.880 --> 04:30.720]  substituted what program they used what resolution do you understand that
[04:30.720 --> 04:38.200]  anybody can do that these are fake videos so we're gonna break it all down
[04:38.200 --> 04:41.360]  it's incredible oh and the police chief in the area where they finally took out
[04:41.360 --> 04:45.120]  the so-called terrorist the Patsy morons that thought they were fighting for
[04:45.120 --> 04:51.840]  jihad what idiots he shot himself twice in the head of course I was about to

[07:59.720 --> 08:16.480]  resistance to tyrants is obedience to God it's Alex Jones
[08:29.720 --> 08:52.600]  now the reforms I'm proposing today should give the American people greater
[08:52.600 --> 08:57.400]  confidence that their rights are being protected even as our intelligence and
[08:57.400 --> 09:01.520]  law enforcement agencies maintain the tools they need to keep us safe the
[09:01.520 --> 09:05.560]  bottom line is that people around the world regardless of their nationality
[09:05.560 --> 09:10.160]  should know that the United States is not spying on ordinary people who don't
[09:10.160 --> 09:14.960]  threaten our national security. President Obama came out today and said
[09:14.960 --> 09:22.760]  relax Paul Revere would love the NSA the NSA spying on you and your family or
[09:22.760 --> 09:28.640]  like your neighbors in your local community they want to help you. Ladies
[09:28.640 --> 09:32.600]  and gentlemen we knew 15 years ago exactly what the national security
[09:32.600 --> 09:39.160]  agency and 14 other illegal agencies were doing grabbing all the digital data
[09:39.160 --> 09:44.600]  and putting it through major hubs to sift through the information not to look
[09:44.600 --> 09:49.560]  for terrorists they keep saying oh we had the NSA in place 9-11 wouldn't have
[09:49.560 --> 09:54.200]  happened Sibel Edmonds has gone public and other whistleblowers who were there
[09:54.200 --> 09:59.560]  on the days before 9-11 tracking the CIA and others protecting al Qaeda
[09:59.560 --> 10:04.160]  protecting the hijackers the FBI lived with some of them they were just
[10:04.160 --> 10:09.800]  patsy cutouts like Lee Harvey Oswald and Tim McVeigh but shifting out of that
[10:09.800 --> 10:15.360]  Obama saying we don't spy on citizens and we don't spy on foreign leaders it's
[10:15.360 --> 10:20.080]  on record they spy on Merkel the head of Germany and others it's on record that
[10:20.080 --> 10:24.480]  Congress is being spied on it's on record that hundreds of major
[10:24.480 --> 10:29.160]  corporations that are part of this are feeding their data from Microsoft to
[10:29.160 --> 10:37.920]  Google to Apple into the NSA grids under Obamacare your healthcare is filed
[10:37.920 --> 10:43.000]  through prism into the NSA so this is all in the fine print this is not a
[10:43.000 --> 10:47.120]  mystery but the general public who was told for decades the government's not
[10:47.120 --> 10:51.000]  watching you because it's illegal that's a conspiracy theory even as
[10:51.000 --> 10:55.520]  whistleblowers like Wayne Madsen from the NSA went public in the mid 90s they
[10:55.520 --> 11:00.160]  would deny that it was happening so the big revelation is that they lied to us
[11:00.160 --> 11:05.400]  they are surveilling us they're using it to target the press from AP to Fox News
[11:05.400 --> 11:09.760]  they're using it to spy on the troops members of the NSA are using it on
[11:09.760 --> 11:13.880]  record to spy on their wives and girlfriends and husbands this is
[11:13.880 --> 11:18.840]  insane of course this unconstitutional power is being abused that's why it's
[11:18.840 --> 11:24.480]  always been illegal in any free society and so why did Obama get up there and
[11:24.480 --> 11:28.760]  give this hour-long speech today because he's desperate he doesn't want to go to
[11:28.760 --> 11:33.000]  jail he's been part of expanding illegal NSA
[11:33.000 --> 11:39.200]  wiretapping and mass searches of internet data private data they've been
[11:39.200 --> 11:43.480]  part of the Homeland Security rollout putting up these police polls that have
[11:43.480 --> 11:48.120]  wireless hubs that grab all of your cell phone info illegally they have been
[11:48.120 --> 11:52.040]  part of this takeover along with the Republican leadership and the
[11:52.040 --> 11:55.640]  Democratic leadership in the Congress the courts have been complicit to a
[11:55.640 --> 12:00.240]  great extent and so now they need to mainline it and say okay we're spying on
[12:00.240 --> 12:05.200]  you but I'm gonna clean it up I'm gonna fix it I'm going to make sure that it's
[12:05.200 --> 12:09.340]  done properly this is the guy that betrayed us on Obamacare this is the
[12:09.340 --> 12:13.480]  guy caught lying more than any other president before you like your doctor
[12:13.480 --> 12:17.120]  you like your plan you can keep your doctor you can keep your plan you like
[12:17.120 --> 12:24.160]  your current insurance you keep that insurance period they're just conditioning
[12:24.160 --> 12:30.280]  us in a process to accept total surveillance and they're telling us that
[12:30.280 --> 12:36.480]  total surveillance beyond 1984 is as American as apple pie just a year ago
[12:36.480 --> 12:44.000]  clapper does the NSA collect any type of data at all on millions or hundreds of
[12:44.000 --> 12:51.240]  millions of Americans no sir the NSA specifically targets the communications
[12:51.240 --> 12:56.680]  of everyone it ingests them by default they are liars they are lying to you
[12:56.680 --> 13:01.160]  like you're a foreign military enemy because America has been hijacked by a
[13:01.160 --> 13:07.160]  corporate offshore takeover that is putting spy hubs into everything from
[13:07.160 --> 13:12.560]  your refrigerator to your computer to your so-called smartphone this is the
[13:12.560 --> 13:17.600]  nature of the new web that's being built it's based on you being surveilled
[13:17.600 --> 13:22.160]  it's based on you having no privacy and they think you're stupid and they're
[13:22.160 --> 13:27.240]  telling you we don't spy on you without warrants oh we got caught well we don't
[13:27.240 --> 13:31.720]  drag net all the info oh we got caught we don't use it politically oh we got
[13:31.720 --> 13:36.480]  caught we don't use it to persecute people oops we do and now Obama is
[13:36.480 --> 13:41.400]  trying to reset coming back going listen Paul Revere would love this the NSA is
[13:41.400 --> 13:47.040]  like your good neighbor this is to keep you safe we want to stop a new 9-11 so
[13:47.040 --> 13:51.080]  they can stage another terror attack or allow terrorists to attack us the same
[13:51.080 --> 13:56.080]  ones they're funding in Syria and say see we told you so you reigned in the
[13:56.080 --> 14:02.000]  NSA and this happened when they'll never even reign it in to begin with its main
[14:02.000 --> 14:06.840]  mission is getting key data to be able to leverage out their competition in the
[14:06.840 --> 14:12.240]  marketplace it's so insiders can game our entire world system like a corrupt
[14:12.240 --> 14:17.280]  casino or like a lottery that's what's happening so that's the secret of this
[14:17.280 --> 14:22.680]  Obama and his other cohorts lied about this existing now because of Snowden
[14:22.680 --> 14:26.640]  and others it's come out and they're engaged in damage control but this is a
[14:26.640 --> 14:30.680]  two-edged sword if they don't get brought to justice now if they don't
[14:30.680 --> 14:34.080]  start getting in trouble now and Congress just says we're gonna give Obama
[14:34.080 --> 14:39.520]  dictatorial power on Obamacare and borders and and NSA to do whatever he
[14:39.520 --> 14:45.480]  wants they've actually then used this crisis of their corruption as a way to
[14:45.480 --> 14:49.920]  get even more power it's like Bush screwed up Katrina on purpose so FEMA
[14:49.920 --> 14:54.720]  got double the funding it's the same thing every time they screw it up and
[14:54.720 --> 14:59.280]  then get more power out of it they're not screwing it up this is all a plan all
[14:59.280 --> 15:05.680]  a program they call it a technocracy so that's why Obama came out to just main
[15:05.680 --> 15:11.080]  line all of it out of the open and then to make himself the savior because the
[15:11.080 --> 15:16.120]  truth is Obama was part of the group that really did build the greatest illegal
[15:16.120 --> 15:20.560]  spy grid the world has ever seen and they're trying to now tell you that he
[15:20.560 --> 15:24.360]  didn't build it and the government didn't build it and Congress didn't
[15:24.360 --> 15:28.360]  build it they're all pointing fingers at each other saying they did it they did
[15:28.360 --> 15:32.320]  it the corporations Google and and and Microsoft are saying the government did
[15:32.320 --> 15:36.760]  it and cybersecurity saying the corporations did it the truth is they
[15:36.760 --> 15:41.400]  all did it together in a giant power grab designing the global architecture of
[15:41.400 --> 15:46.120]  the internet to be a predatory surveillance system where the insiders
[15:46.120 --> 15:51.480]  can game the rest of the world system and consolidate power in a monopolistic
[15:51.480 --> 15:56.120]  program this is criminal authoritarianism the sleeping giant that is for
[15:56.120 --> 16:01.760]  humanity is awakening and Obama and his minions and his supporters need to
[16:01.760 --> 16:05.720]  understand that when the history books are finally written they will be known
[16:05.720 --> 16:10.840]  as the tyrants they indeed are because we the people are awakening and remember
[16:10.840 --> 16:17.000]  if you're watching this transmission you are the resistance remember that one of
[16:17.000 --> 16:21.480]  the top national security advisors came out in the Atlantic Council and called
[16:21.480 --> 16:25.640]  for a giant crisis so that the public would submit to their takeover and
[16:25.640 --> 16:29.640]  admitted that they are falling apart that they are imploding right now and
[16:29.640 --> 16:34.720]  that the free individual and highly motivated empowered individuals are the
[16:34.720 --> 16:39.680]  enemy of this corporate group not the communists Chinese not other thug
[16:39.680 --> 16:43.640]  regimes they know how to deal with people like themselves they don't know how to
[16:43.640 --> 16:48.880]  deal with moral people who are not going to be slaves I'm Alex Jones signing off
[16:48.880 --> 16:52.720]  for info wars nightly news
[16:52.720 --> 16:58.520]  ladies and gentlemen we're live on this Monday the 12th day of January 2015
[16:58.520 --> 17:05.640]  that was a eight-minute report Obama fears arrest and is running scare from
[17:05.640 --> 17:18.120]  NSA scandal from January 17th 2014 just shy of a year ago or 360 days ago to be
[17:18.120 --> 17:24.560]  precise and I put that video out to show how it's illegal to show how
[17:24.560 --> 17:28.960]  bipartisanly they've engaged in crimes and should be indicted like Richard
[17:28.960 --> 17:36.440]  Nixon was in the house and should be fully impeached but now they use the
[17:36.440 --> 17:40.320]  very fact that they have a surveillance grid in place and have allowed
[17:40.320 --> 17:44.920]  terrorists to attack in Paris France as a pretext to give them even more
[17:44.920 --> 17:49.320]  surveillance power that's unconstitutional worldwide violates the
[17:49.320 --> 17:53.960]  French Constitution the EU Constitution our US Constitution state
[17:53.960 --> 17:58.640]  constitutions even though they have this giant surveillance grid in place and
[17:58.640 --> 18:03.280]  these brothers and their accomplice had Facebook pages and they were both on no
[18:03.280 --> 18:07.520]  fly list their bimbo girlfriend was on a no fly list and they were allowed to

[25:41.520 --> 25:45.520]  investigations and say oh there are no FEMA camps because they're not called
[25:45.520 --> 25:49.160]  FEMA camps they're called emergency centers establishment act they're
[25:49.160 --> 25:54.200]  called civilian inmate labor camp program they're called Rex 84 continuity

[25:59.080 --> 26:06.480]  just giving you bam bam bam bam the plan that's what makes me sick is this
[26:06.480 --> 26:10.800]  is all public the degenerate criminals running our government other Western
[26:10.800 --> 26:17.080]  governments have been caught in almost every case finding mentally ill patsies
[26:17.080 --> 26:21.640]  and then drugging them and having them carry out attacks like the underwear
[26:21.640 --> 26:28.640]  bombing or we've got Haskell who caught them on that flight or they fund them and
[26:28.640 --> 26:34.800]  train real terrorists but publicly the West gives them the training area the
[26:34.800 --> 26:39.560]  weapons and lets them fly even when they're on no fly list and it comes out
[26:39.560 --> 26:44.960]  in the BBC and the Telegraph and the Wall Street Journal oh yeah the West let
[26:44.960 --> 26:52.360]  the terrorists fly back and forth just like on 9-11 just like in 1993 to the
[26:52.360 --> 26:58.880]  New York Times twice in the tapes Ahmad Salem the FBI informant retired

[27:16.880 --> 27:22.960]  busted them right there and stopped it let it happen that model is what's going
[27:22.960 --> 27:32.600]  on there it is the New York Times terrorist plots hatched by the FBI go
[27:32.600 --> 27:36.880]  read it that's just one article see that's what I'm saying just like Rex 84

[28:01.320 --> 28:05.080]  what are you doing endorsing radicalism saying it doesn't exist I had to say
[28:05.080 --> 28:10.240]  that I said our criminal government is arming them aiding and abetting them
[28:10.240 --> 28:16.600]  protecting them to attack and kill us so they can take our freedoms that's what
[28:16.600 --> 28:24.800]  I said CNN MSNBC Fox News Glenn Beck and everybody else it runs around claiming
[28:24.800 --> 28:29.720]  that I'm saying there aren't any real Muslim terrorists that's a load of
[28:29.720 --> 28:36.080]  crud and you know it stop misrepresenting what I say stop lying about me we're

[33:42.200 --> 33:47.680]  to al-Qaeda and the Taliban starting in the 1980s and gave them tens of billions
[33:47.680 --> 33:54.240]  of dollars of funding training and weapons then they were allowed to operate
[33:54.240 --> 33:59.840]  in and out of Saudi Arabia on terror arrest list and we're still allowed to
[33:59.840 --> 34:03.880]  fly to the US and when the head of the US embassy visa department springman who

[36:25.680 --> 36:30.960]  gaggles of snot nose teenagers that think this is really you know something
[36:30.960 --> 36:36.920]  upset mom and dad to talk about jihad what'll do is get your butt locked up the

[36:49.400 --> 36:54.880]  social networks are allowing it that's even been in mainstream news why on
[36:54.880 --> 37:00.200]  earth do they let them call for violence and recruit and despite all the
[37:00.200 --> 37:04.840]  spy grids France is even worse than the U.S. on record with its spine the NSA
[37:04.840 --> 37:14.360]  stuff doubled squared they are surveilling everything and meanwhile that
[37:14.360 --> 37:18.520]  the terrorists have Facebook's bragging that they're in Yemen training for a
[37:18.520 --> 37:22.560]  jihad and they're not picked up off the street well of course they weren't the
[37:22.560 --> 37:27.560]  underwear bomber mutalib one week before they announced naked body scanners going
[37:27.560 --> 37:32.400]  in all the major airports that they put an order in for 14 months before a year
[37:32.400 --> 37:37.800]  before the government ordered thousands of machines a year before the first
[37:37.800 --> 37:42.160]  delivery was set to roll out in January and then there's a underwear bombing and
[37:42.160 --> 37:45.640]  the former head of Homeland Security is getting tens of millions of dollars
[37:45.640 --> 37:50.040]  himself the company billions for the machines gee that's not a conflict of
[37:50.040 --> 37:58.160]  interest and then we there's this lawyer he contacts us look at me I'm on the
[37:58.160 --> 38:02.880]  plane I'm a listener me and my wife are lawyers a smart dressed man got him on
[38:02.880 --> 38:07.200]  sharp dressed man that we should come back next segment with sharp dressed man
[38:07.200 --> 38:11.880]  ZZ top got him on argued with the head people didn't have any ID got him on the
[38:11.880 --> 38:15.920]  plane then the underwear bomber as they're getting ready to land coming in
[38:15.920 --> 38:20.280]  you're starting to descend a guy gets up four rows behind us and gets on a knee
[38:20.280 --> 38:28.480]  and starts filming professionally where mutalib is mutalib then gets up
[38:30.040 --> 38:37.440]  stands in the aisle and a firecracker goes off in his pants then months later
[38:37.440 --> 38:42.440]  after we break it at info wars.com this point now we don't play games here we
[38:42.440 --> 38:45.680]  tell you we got a source we tell you got intel we tell you there's missing nukes
[38:45.680 --> 38:50.480]  from Dias you can guarantee that was reported to us from high level on the
[38:50.480 --> 38:56.040]  base we don't make stuff up you understand that every once while we make a
[38:56.040 --> 39:00.440]  mistake we tell you about it we wish this wasn't true I wish there was no
[39:00.440 --> 39:05.400]  terrorism but let me tell you I wish it was real that's a lot less scary to have
[39:05.400 --> 39:09.680]  some stupid 20 year old punk with a little firecracker in his pants being an
[39:09.680 --> 39:13.320]  idiot I'd laugh at that every day it's darn scary our government drugged him up
[39:13.320 --> 39:16.160]  and brought him on there turned out the unknown agency was a central
[39:16.160 --> 39:21.120]  intelligence agency we're gonna play those clips from Congress in a moment
[39:21.120 --> 39:28.960]  so Anwar Alakhi is behind Fort Hood the underwear bombing attacks on US
[39:28.960 --> 39:36.080]  military bases all over the place what just happened in Paris and a bunch of
[39:36.080 --> 39:41.520]  other events and he's the secret dinner guest at the Pentagon and and high
[39:41.520 --> 39:46.920]  rolling around with the bin Laden's at Bush events for Carlisle shareholders
[39:46.920 --> 39:55.800]  Leningrad reported that the bin Laden's were quote at Bush's table and let me
[39:55.800 --> 39:59.720]  tell you it's a great plan the US's ally with Saudi Arabia that is the
[39:59.720 --> 40:05.640]  criminals that run our country are bipartisan Saudi Arabia is to take over
[40:05.640 --> 40:09.320]  the whole Middle East using their jihadis a few of their low levels that
[40:09.320 --> 40:12.080]  don't know what they're doing are allowed and directed into attack the
[40:12.080 --> 40:16.160]  West and controlled operations the local cops don't know the local cops find
[40:16.160 --> 40:19.320]  out and write a report about it you just shoot them twice in the head at their
[40:19.320 --> 40:22.840]  desk that just happened another little key sign we're gonna be getting into
[40:22.840 --> 40:29.560]  that report the three cops are real that died the other 16 17 people that were
[40:29.560 --> 40:33.400]  killed that was real the two brothers and their accomplice those are real
[40:33.400 --> 40:38.120]  jihadis too stupid just like the general public to understand the
[40:38.120 --> 40:41.800]  compartmentalization and how they were controlled through criminal networks up
[40:41.800 --> 40:46.080]  to the private banks that issue the currency that have hijacked all our
[40:46.080 --> 40:49.880]  countries and are running us into the ground and who are building a police
[40:49.880 --> 40:54.440]  state that is for in the Fedders returning veterans gun owners libertarians
[40:54.440 --> 40:58.720]  pro-lifers you name it if you got your head screwed on straight don't have a
[40:58.720 --> 41:05.400]  criminal record work hard know how to use a gun are civically involved the ADL
[41:05.400 --> 41:08.680]  the southern poverty law center the Democratic Party the federal government
[41:08.680 --> 41:14.080]  spends its nights up late scared because you still have access to juries and
[41:14.080 --> 41:19.080]  grand juries you can still vote you got power you're good guys and who are the
[41:19.080 --> 41:23.920]  scumbags scared of they're scared of the good guys and you look at all the real
[41:23.920 --> 41:28.240]  training it's for the good guys ladies and gentlemen you can see how this
[41:28.240 --> 41:33.360]  works and I couldn't believe it when world net daily six seven years ago was
[41:33.360 --> 41:36.600]  connecting stuff of the Muslim Brotherhood in al-Qaeda to Obama I thought
[41:36.600 --> 41:42.440]  no he's not independently running al-Qaeda and now it turns out Obama and
[41:42.440 --> 41:48.200]  his family in Kenya at least the family he's connected to his half brothers and
[41:48.200 --> 41:55.040]  cousins or run the radical Muslims publicly and run the Muslim Brotherhood
[41:55.040 --> 42:01.200]  I mean I remember seeing Anderson Cooper his CIA on CNN few years ago they were
[42:01.200 --> 42:05.160]  overthrowing Egypt and put a Muslim Brotherhood in and al-Qaeda was attacking
[42:05.160 --> 42:09.320]  the military and trying to blow up dams on the Suez Canal and Cooper was saying
[42:09.320 --> 42:13.720]  their freedom fighters on I mean I can't even believe this at this point I mean
[42:13.720 --> 42:18.160]  CNN is saying al-Qaeda are freedom fighters just like they said in Syria and
[42:18.160 --> 42:21.760]  Libya their freedom fighters and this is where these guys came from and this is
[42:21.760 --> 42:29.000]  where the woman this French bimbo that was into these guys because some women
[42:29.000 --> 42:32.800]  think that aggressive terrorists and scum Stockholm syndrome you know that's
[42:32.800 --> 42:35.520]  real manly
[42:38.200 --> 42:46.520]  Hayat Boma Diney how the hell you say this idiot's name Boma Denny the partner
[42:46.520 --> 42:53.360]  of Islamist gunman AFP reporting that she's now run into Syria through Turkey
[42:53.360 --> 42:56.640]  she who do you think let her on an airplane anything letter she gets into
[42:56.640 --> 43:01.400]  Turkey she's all over the news and now she's gotten away of course she's
[43:01.400 --> 43:06.000]  probably the controller of them fact I predict that's gonna come out just like
[43:06.000 --> 43:11.280]  I said 7-7 was being handled by a SWAT because he's the known controller in MI
[43:11.280 --> 43:17.960]  6 it even came out the FBI even admitted that on Fox News that yes there was a
[43:17.960 --> 43:24.760]  double agent he betrayed us and ran the bombing no he didn't know he didn't he
[43:24.760 --> 43:31.360]  was allowed to go get away then allowed to return to England staged stage stage
[43:31.360 --> 43:35.320]  the argument is well we infiltrate these groups to stop them no you don't you
[43:35.320 --> 43:41.920]  infiltrate them to lead them against us and I'll say this you know the drill
[43:41.920 --> 43:46.440]  anybody look at the world Almanac or just 200 something people killed a year
[43:46.440 --> 43:50.360]  in the US by Honey Beach 300 something by Yellowjackets 300 something by Red
[43:50.360 --> 43:58.440]  Wasp 40 something by Pit Bulls another hundred or so by other dog attacks this
[43:58.440 --> 44:05.000]  stuff still real rare but couple dozen a year get killed by terrorism so even if
[44:05.000 --> 44:10.480]  this was real and they were really killing everybody do you give up your
[44:10.480 --> 44:13.920]  liberties and your freedoms because 20 people get killed in France and there's
[44:13.920 --> 44:18.480]  worldwide marches and oh we need a police state now extremist threat it's law
[44:18.480 --> 44:23.920]  enforcement against civil rights as if giving up liberty equal security well
[44:23.920 --> 44:27.440]  Benjamin Franklin told us those that give up liberty for so-called security
[44:27.440 --> 44:31.360]  deserve and we'll get neither that's the road to serfdom the road to bondage the
[44:31.360 --> 44:36.280]  road to shackles the road to slavery I mean come on Eisenhower in a famous
[44:36.280 --> 44:40.080]  speech paraphrased to the only way to keep you totally safe is to lock you up
[44:40.080 --> 44:45.280]  in a prison that was at Columbia University pull up Eisenhower speech on
[44:45.280 --> 44:48.800]  I can make you completely safe by putting you in a jail cell I think that's
[44:48.800 --> 44:54.000]  the I think that'll pull up the actual speech that's how this works well you
[44:54.000 --> 44:59.720]  know what no thank you my communications are mine and again 7 7 9 11 this
[44:59.720 --> 45:03.480]  their communications are everywhere they're allowed to operate do whatever
[45:03.480 --> 45:08.880]  they want they attack and then nobody gets in trouble Dwight D Eisenhower if
[45:08.880 --> 45:13.040]  you want total security go to prison there your fed cloth given medical care
[45:13.040 --> 45:18.040]  and so on the only thing lacking is freedom and if you elaborate on the
[45:18.040 --> 45:22.640]  that quotes prisons one of the most dangerous places to be so then it's not
[45:22.640 --> 45:28.640]  safe either the only way to be safe is independent free and strong armed and
[45:28.640 --> 45:35.480]  self-sufficient and not putting up with gangs organizing against you so suspected
[45:35.480 --> 45:39.640]  parachuter live with underwear bomber in Yemen
[45:39.640 --> 45:44.760]  that's now being reported by AP Reuters you name it stories up on info wars
[45:44.760 --> 45:49.560]  dot com police chief investigating Charlie Hebdo attack reportedly commit
[45:49.560 --> 45:53.600]  suicide said to have killed himself a preparing report on the terror attack
[45:53.600 --> 46:01.600]  boy does anybody believe that Helrick Ferdew 45 was found dead in his office
[46:01.600 --> 46:05.240]  after allegedly killing himself with his service weapon while writing a report
[46:05.240 --> 46:08.560]  on the terror attack and his death was largely ignored by the mainstream media
[46:08.560 --> 46:12.840]  he handle all the local stuff and what really happened well dead men tell no
[46:12.840 --> 46:17.080]  tales mmm because the word is they're holding a bunch of the hostages still
[46:17.080 --> 46:19.880]  trying to get him debrief because they heard some stuff they weren't supposed
[46:19.880 --> 46:27.160]  to hear from the little wannabe jihadis it started to figure something out both
[46:27.160 --> 46:30.680]  brothers behind Paris attack had weapons training in Yemen remember that
[46:30.680 --> 46:40.760]  Reuters now before I go any further let's just go to the clips here this is
[46:40.760 --> 46:44.800]  Colonel Schaefer the expert on al-Qaeda who was constantly stopped from taking
[46:44.800 --> 46:47.240]  him out in Afghanistan over a five-year operation
[46:47.240 --> 46:52.840]  Amar al-Laki was an FBI asset triple agent before 9-11 here's Colonel Schaefer
[46:52.840 --> 47:03.480]  before 9-11 that's one of the things that no one wanted to come out that this guy had been a double triple agent and they were actually working with them with the FBI
[47:03.480 --> 47:06.960]  Colonel I'm sorry to interrupt but your phone cut out during that key point go back a
[47:06.960 --> 47:09.560]  minute ago back to the beginning of a lock you start over
[47:09.560 --> 47:15.280]  well I'm lucky was actually an asset of the FBI before 9-11 so that's frankly Alex
[47:15.280 --> 47:18.600]  one of the things this administration was doing on behalf of all the
[47:18.600 --> 47:22.720]  administrations was covering their tracks on warlock he had a documented
[47:22.720 --> 47:27.480]  relationship with the US government and the federal bureau investigation
[47:27.480 --> 47:32.440]  proceeding this is before it is before 9-11 so what they were doing Alex was
[47:32.440 --> 47:36.840]  going back covering their tracks but beyond that now okay the full hour
[47:36.840 --> 47:40.800]  interview is at info wars.com by the way he got in trouble for that interview and
[47:40.800 --> 47:43.320]  threatened as well but he keeps coming back on even though he gets threatened
[47:43.320 --> 47:47.840]  and he still works for the CIA and the Pentagon I'll just leave it at that in a
[47:47.840 --> 47:53.160]  more classified area now and again he was the one that told us in a
[47:53.160 --> 47:59.400]  congressional hearings actually he didn't tell us other people told us he's
[47:59.400 --> 48:03.680]  on the show and he said that it's much more than 65% as they're saying of the
[48:03.680 --> 48:09.320]  Syrian free army free Syrian army being al-Qaeda it's a lot higher and I talked
[48:09.320 --> 48:14.240]  one about other sources and they said it's a 95% is al-Qaeda they just changed
[48:14.240 --> 48:19.840]  the name again to confuse the public to IS. Let's go to flashback this is Patrick
[48:19.840 --> 48:24.760]  F. Kennedy testimony from the Department of Transportation admits being forced
[48:24.760 --> 48:30.520]  to allow underwear bomber on flight by an unnamed US agency now named as the
[48:30.520 --> 48:35.640]  central intelligence agency confirming what our source Kurt Haskell said he
[48:35.640 --> 48:39.840]  saw one and a half to two months before this was in Congress. Why didn't the
[48:39.840 --> 48:43.920]  consular officer not check the visa status of the Nigerian national at the
[48:43.920 --> 48:52.240]  time the second notice was sent? He did not do that Mr. Chairman. I know he didn't do it why not?
[48:52.240 --> 48:59.960]  Because the the the the second message was launched from another source.
[49:02.880 --> 49:08.760]  Seven days later on January 27th. As I mentioned my statement Mr. Chairman if we
[49:08.760 --> 49:14.240]  unilaterally revoke the visa and there was a case recently up we had that we
[49:14.240 --> 49:21.360]  have a request from a law enforcement agency to not revoke the visa we came
[49:21.360 --> 49:26.280]  across information we said this is a dangerous person we were ready to revoke
[49:26.280 --> 49:30.560]  the visa we then went to the community and said should we revoke this visa and
[49:30.560 --> 49:35.480]  one of the members and would be glad to give you that out of private said please
[49:35.480 --> 49:40.520]  do not revoke this visa we have eyes on this person we are following this person
[49:40.520 --> 49:45.440]  who has the visa for the purpose of trying to roll up a higher network not
[49:45.440 --> 49:51.400]  just stop one person so we will revoke the visa of any individual who is a
[49:51.400 --> 49:56.080]  threat to the United States but we do take one preliminary step we ask our
[49:56.080 --> 50:00.360]  law enforcement and intelligence community partners do you have eyes on
[50:00.360 --> 50:05.400]  this person and do you want us to let this person proceed under your
[50:05.400 --> 50:11.160]  surveillance so that you may potentially break a larger block and again
[50:11.160 --> 50:15.360]  Fijet was reading during a slate for radio listeners that says seven days
[50:15.360 --> 50:21.920]  later when he was back and to testify the network is Amar Alalaki that gets his
[50:21.920 --> 50:27.120]  marching orders from inside the federal government and NATO and they always let
[50:27.120 --> 50:31.720]  the attacks take place and then cover them up they give them weapons and arms
[50:31.720 --> 50:35.840]  and turned them loose against Syria and Libya and Egypt that's what's happening
[50:35.840 --> 50:41.240]  so they can then justify the police state takeover and that's the big news here
[50:41.240 --> 50:44.480]  ladies and gentlemen I know most of you as an audience have researched this
[50:44.480 --> 50:48.120]  yourself you know it's true now we need to warn others and get this
[50:48.120 --> 50:52.320]  information out because again the target of all this they're not going to close
[50:52.320 --> 50:55.560]  the borders they're not going to stop all the radicals coming in they're going
[50:55.560 --> 51:00.520]  to accelerate that they're expanding all this to target us this is a serious

[54:19.480 --> 54:24.320]  he's now handling the latest group of terrorists and Major Assan from the
[54:24.320 --> 54:29.120]  Fort Hood shooting and basically every other attack notice they're saying that
[54:29.120 --> 54:36.320]  they let him keep his visa know what was in the Dutch papers and the Detroit
[54:36.320 --> 54:44.840]  Free Press once we broke this was that he didn't have a visa and didn't have the
[54:44.840 --> 54:48.560]  proper other identification and they got him on the plane with a high-level
[54:48.560 --> 54:58.560]  security official so see that's disinformation within disinformation
[54:58.560 --> 55:02.360]  there's Kurt Nemo's story dead French terrorists linked to Pentagon dinner
[55:02.360 --> 55:06.360]  guest Amaral Alaki Kurt wrote about that days ago it's now in mainstream news
[55:06.360 --> 55:12.520]  today but mainstream news is like oh my gosh Amaral Alaki he's so incredibly
[55:12.520 --> 55:20.080]  frightening oh the terrorists are connected to Al Qaeda but not ISIS ISIS is
[55:20.080 --> 55:26.440]  the new name of the army that the West has been funding that is creating its
[55:26.440 --> 55:33.360]  own Islamic State with Al Qaeda doctrine and I know I've hammered this it's
[55:33.360 --> 55:38.600]  admitted that that's the case it's just so frustrating Lord Monkton is joining
[55:38.600 --> 55:43.240]  us to discuss the record cold temperatures all over the place you've
[55:43.240 --> 55:48.360]  seen the news snowing in Hawaii snowing in Florida so-called penguins are
[55:48.360 --> 55:53.320]  hiding in Antarctica ice sheets getting record size but Al Gore says pay him
[55:53.320 --> 55:57.400]  carbon taxes and California has started it whether the public likes it or not
[55:57.400 --> 56:01.360]  that's all coming up about 20 minutes with him then I'm gonna shift gears
[56:01.360 --> 56:08.440]  into the terror attacks when the attacks by the EU on free speech the EU and
[56:08.440 --> 56:12.040]  others have called for his arrest for critics for denying global warming as
[56:12.040 --> 56:16.040]  if it's Holocaust denial see first thing try to pass laws saying you can't
[56:16.040 --> 56:19.760]  deny the Holocaust and then next you can't deny global warming next you
[56:19.760 --> 56:24.400]  can't say you don't want your six-year-old taught about how to have a
[56:24.400 --> 56:28.720]  sex change in public school see how that works you take away somebody's free
[56:28.720 --> 56:34.040]  speech to deny the Holocaust whether you agree with that or not you then take
[56:34.040 --> 56:37.560]  away everybody else's free speech that's kind of how it works so to have
[56:37.560 --> 56:42.120]  France making a big deal about free speech and having all these rallies and
[56:42.120 --> 56:47.000]  mainstream media behind it well now they're coming out and drudgerport.com
[56:47.000 --> 56:50.360]  linked to this yesterday government prepares internet speech crackdown
[56:50.360 --> 56:54.600]  following Paris attacks another report by Kurt Nemo with the announcement so
[56:54.600 --> 56:58.600]  they're now getting ready to surveil more take more internet freedom away when
[56:58.600 --> 57:02.000]  these guys were flying around the world at terror training bases and the
[57:02.000 --> 57:08.200]  government was watching them and let them do it well also get into this
[57:08.200 --> 57:12.640]  police chief was doing a report on it he was the police chief in charge where
[57:12.640 --> 57:16.360]  they were finally taken out and well he got found dead while he was writing the
[57:16.360 --> 57:24.160]  report yeah this is definitely a false flag where they protected the radicals
[57:24.160 --> 57:27.680]  I can't believe it it's just again I mean how they get rocket launchers into
[57:27.680 --> 57:31.560]  the country how they do all this and now Paul Watson who is not the conspiracy
[57:31.560 --> 57:38.080]  terrorist has a report info wars.com weird footage prompts claims of Charlie

[57:47.240 --> 57:55.200]  head and now Paul is getting into it so I just can't believe it I just even when
[57:55.200 --> 57:59.760]  we don't think it's staged it's it's staged complete with dead police chiefs
[57:59.760 --> 58:04.360]  that they're not reporting on very much I mean this this whole thing stings and
[58:04.360 --> 58:08.000]  the media is collectively not pointing out that hey we put them in charge and
[58:08.000 --> 58:15.840]  now the terrorist the one that lived has run to Syria through Turkey same deal

[01:00:19.640 --> 01:00:23.200]  Alex Jones
[01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:33.440]  Paul Watson has filed a report I'm gonna play about four minutes of it here is an
[01:00:33.440 --> 01:00:37.960]  11-minute report you're ready a listener need to go to info wars.com
[01:00:37.960 --> 01:00:42.040]  forward slash show to see the video feed you want to be able to see this or go
[01:00:42.040 --> 01:00:46.640]  watch the full report at prisonplanet.com or Watson has it posted weird
[01:00:46.640 --> 01:00:52.880]  footage prompts claim of Charlie Hebdo conspiracy video contradicts reports of
[01:00:52.880 --> 01:00:57.520]  police officer being shot in the head here is part of Paul Watson's report
[01:00:57.520 --> 01:01:02.120]  then Lord Monkons coming up some more thoughts on the attacks in France and
[01:01:02.120 --> 01:01:05.960]  first of all this video contains no graphic footage whatsoever no violence
[01:01:05.960 --> 01:01:10.880]  no blood I say that because my first video on this subject was removed from
[01:01:10.880 --> 01:01:15.360]  YouTube and then only reinstated with an age restriction despite the fact that
[01:01:15.360 --> 01:01:20.360]  had no footage whatsoever of any violent action but to start off with
[01:01:20.360 --> 01:01:24.560]  obviously this is a video that a lot of people have been talking about and storm
[01:01:24.560 --> 01:01:28.840]  clouds gathering has done a good analysis it shows the two terrorists
[01:01:28.840 --> 01:01:35.680]  involved in the Charlie Hebdo siege executing a police officer the first on
[01:01:35.680 --> 01:01:41.360]  the scene of course was the Muslim himself Ahmed Meribet and as you can
[01:01:41.360 --> 01:01:45.480]  see from the footage which I will not play but you can see linked down in the
[01:01:45.480 --> 01:01:51.760]  bar below they apparently wound him first then walk up to him and shoot him
[01:01:51.760 --> 01:01:55.000]  in the head the problem with this explanation as a lot of people have
[01:01:55.000 --> 01:02:01.520]  pointed out is that shooting somebody at point blank range with an AK-47 in the
[01:02:01.520 --> 01:02:08.720]  head would produce at least some blood splatter if not complete obliteration of
[01:02:08.720 --> 01:02:13.760]  the head what we appear to see from this video is a gunshot that hits the
[01:02:13.760 --> 01:02:19.040]  pavement bounces away and doesn't actually go into the police officer's
[01:02:19.040 --> 01:02:23.480]  head so people are legitimately asking questions as to why the mainstream media
[01:02:23.480 --> 01:02:29.240]  has widely reported the fact that this Muslim police officer was executed in
[01:02:29.240 --> 01:02:35.360]  this moment having been shot in the head when you watch the video it appears as
[01:02:35.360 --> 01:02:42.320]  if the shot is fired a foot away from the officer into the pavement you see
[01:02:42.320 --> 01:02:46.400]  the residue from the shot as it apparently hits the pavement the
[01:02:46.400 --> 01:02:50.680]  officer shows no reaction to being shot in the head there's no violent movement
[01:02:50.680 --> 01:02:55.960]  of the head backwards so people are asking why the media is reporting that
[01:02:55.960 --> 01:02:59.760]  this officer was shot in the head when this video appears to suggest otherwise
[01:02:59.760 --> 01:03:05.720]  does this mean that the entire attack on Charlie Hebdo as well as the attack on a
[01:03:05.720 --> 01:03:11.480]  Jewish grocery store was staged was a hoax that nobody ever died in these
[01:03:11.480 --> 01:03:15.440]  attacks all right let's stop right there what you see the full report Watson
[01:03:15.440 --> 01:03:19.440]  goes into discrediting that we had callers day one saying they believed it
[01:03:19.440 --> 01:03:23.280]  looked like a fake gunshot and I kind of disagreed with them saying it could be
[01:03:23.280 --> 01:03:30.000]  fake could be part of a PR stunt but there's a big problem with that I
[01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:36.840]  personally have shot deer and wild hogs and other large mammals in the head and
[01:03:36.840 --> 01:03:42.280]  with high-powered I mean seven mil mags sometimes the more powerful the rifle
[01:03:42.280 --> 01:03:48.080]  the less blood it'll go in an eye go all the way through the top of the skull
[01:03:48.080 --> 01:03:53.520]  skimming through the top and then shoot out an ear and they'll just be a tiny
[01:03:53.520 --> 01:03:57.320]  bit of blood or you'll shoot a hog in the head feral hogs there's like five
[01:03:57.320 --> 01:04:00.400]  million up in Texas alone eight people's dogs cats you name it people don't
[01:04:00.400 --> 01:04:05.240]  pigs do that that they do that and you'll shoot a hog in the head and blood
[01:04:05.240 --> 01:04:10.800]  splatters everywhere or you shoot a deer I mean I've shot a deer through its
[01:04:10.800 --> 01:04:19.640]  shoulder with a 308 and like 30 yards away and there was less blood than if I
[01:04:19.640 --> 01:04:24.680]  shot it at 200 yards away because the bullets going so fast it just goes right
[01:04:24.680 --> 01:04:28.520]  through even though it was a soft point so you never know what bullets are gonna
[01:04:28.520 --> 01:04:32.880]  do troops have been shot with a 223 and it goes in a shoulder and comes out
[01:04:32.880 --> 01:04:38.760]  their foot just bullet ballistics can do anything so the fact that his head
[01:04:38.760 --> 01:04:43.920]  doesn't blow up that shows a lot of people don't know how bullets act it
[01:04:43.920 --> 01:04:48.120]  could be fake I'm not saying that BBC is even out saying you know it doesn't
[01:04:48.120 --> 01:04:52.640]  make sense I was just told today that they've come out with a video we'll
[01:04:52.640 --> 01:04:57.200]  play later and post on info wars calm under Watson so but I mean how many BBC
[01:04:57.200 --> 01:05:02.000]  producers know how bullets act when cells become toxic they die early and aging

[01:08:16.920 --> 01:08:21.160]  on Mars and other planets according to space probes according to Al Gore it's
[01:08:21.160 --> 01:08:25.160]  because you haven't paid him enough carbon taxes well last week California
[01:08:25.160 --> 01:08:30.320]  began slapping a heavy tax on every gallon of gasoline calling it a carbon
[01:08:30.320 --> 01:08:35.080]  tax Australia's been struggling to repeal theirs that has devastated their
[01:08:35.080 --> 01:08:41.440]  farming and ranching the number one opponent of this worldwide is Lord

[01:08:49.480 --> 01:08:55.320]  the UK the fastest growing party and he'll give us his take on EU censorship
[01:08:55.320 --> 01:08:58.600]  I know he's been a big critic of EU censorship so we're gonna get to that
[01:08:58.600 --> 01:09:01.720]  in a moment because here they are having marches for free speech which I'm all
[01:09:01.720 --> 01:09:07.400]  for but I mean there's calls in the EU and in major newspapers to arrest Lord
[01:09:07.400 --> 01:09:11.400]  Moncton for putting out scientific policy reports he used to advise Margaret
[01:09:11.400 --> 01:09:16.480]  Thatcher on science he's also a journalist and an inventor and I mean I've
[01:09:16.480 --> 01:09:20.920]  seen him on websites call for my arrest so to have the EU grandstanding about
[01:09:20.920 --> 01:09:25.720]  free speech is rich we're gonna talk to him about that and more coming up here
[01:09:25.720 --> 01:09:30.440]  in just a few minutes as he joins us from the UK but Joe Biggs former staff
[01:09:30.440 --> 01:09:37.000]  sergeant a lot of combat Afghanistan and Iraq as reported by a Michael Hastings
[01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:40.680]  of course when he was embedded with him off and on for years saw a lot of combat
[01:09:40.680 --> 01:09:45.280]  and I've shot wild hogs I've shot deer before with high-powered rifles and
[01:09:45.280 --> 01:09:48.200]  there's almost no blood sometimes there's a ton of blood sometimes their
[01:09:48.200 --> 01:09:51.640]  whole head blows off I don't mean to be macabre that's just part of hunting and
[01:09:51.640 --> 01:09:54.960]  you better hunt wild hogs there's five million in Texas alone they'll eat your
[01:09:54.960 --> 01:09:59.680]  dog your cats in your backyard their vicious wild boars now Joe I said Joe
[01:09:59.680 --> 01:10:02.520]  have you ever shot anybody in the head or seen it well there's not a bunch of
[01:10:02.520 --> 01:10:06.600]  blood because it's a big conspiracy now it's in the media saying it looks like
[01:10:06.600 --> 01:10:11.480]  there's no blood when the cop gets shot in the head outside Charlie Hebdo I think
[01:10:11.480 --> 01:10:15.800]  these are real terrorists that attacked and I've said that clearly the West let
[01:10:15.800 --> 01:10:20.880]  them on no fly list didn't stop them help give them a base in Syria I think
[01:10:20.880 --> 01:10:24.600]  that's terrible so the West at the end of the day has helped sponsor this and
[01:10:24.600 --> 01:10:27.400]  we'll now take our freedoms as a response to it while letting record
[01:10:27.400 --> 01:10:33.400]  numbers of radicals move in but this is a side tidbit Joe I've shot wild hogs a
[01:10:33.400 --> 01:10:40.120]  lot of them and seen where a lot of blood I mean does it show up I mean I
[01:10:40.120 --> 01:10:43.680]  don't mean to get graphic but I shot a walled hog with a 7 mil mag in the side
[01:10:43.680 --> 01:10:46.800]  of the head the whole side of the head opened up that didn't happen with the
[01:10:46.800 --> 01:10:51.080]  cop the brain basically blew out but almost no blood I've also shot a hog
[01:10:51.080 --> 01:10:57.040]  through the eye came out the back almost no blood now you said that with
[01:10:57.040 --> 01:11:01.120]  humans that's not the case that blood just fountains everywhere you've seen
[01:11:01.120 --> 01:11:06.520]  the video you think it's pure bull what do you say as an expert on this it with
[01:11:06.520 --> 01:11:10.800]  a high-powered AK-47 at that kind of a close range number one is going to do
[01:11:10.800 --> 01:11:14.680]  some damage on a target I mean we could take an AK-47 out right now put a
[01:11:14.680 --> 01:11:18.480]  watermelon down on the sidewalk shoot at it from arms length arms length away
[01:11:18.480 --> 01:11:22.160]  you're going to see some damage to that so that's not consistent at all either
[01:11:22.160 --> 01:11:27.680]  something that close whether 762 his head would just just be completely
[01:11:27.680 --> 01:11:32.920]  annihilated and then you see there's no recoil in the weapon now that's
[01:11:32.920 --> 01:11:36.240]  consistent with shooting a blank you know I've shot blanks in different training
[01:11:36.240 --> 01:11:39.960]  exercises the M4 will not react the same way doesn't have the same kind of
[01:11:39.960 --> 01:11:44.320]  recoil to it when you have an actual round in there where it'll actually kick
[01:11:44.320 --> 01:11:48.720]  back so you don't see any kind of kickback in AK-47 these are not really
[01:11:48.720 --> 01:11:53.200]  big guys I don't see them being so strong they can overpower that that AK-47s
[01:11:53.200 --> 01:11:57.720]  recoil and then like I said the consistent you don't see the blood you
[01:11:57.720 --> 01:12:03.400]  also see the the pavement on the sidewalk up from the head you see a ricochet of
[01:12:03.400 --> 01:12:07.480]  some sort away from where the head is so a lot of it doesn't add up to maybe he
[01:12:07.480 --> 01:12:10.760]  didn't kill the cop with a headshot and killed him with the with the woundings
[01:12:10.760 --> 01:12:15.040]  he's on the ground I mean I'm just not gonna go and say the whole thing's
[01:12:15.040 --> 01:12:18.760]  fake because of this yeah well I guess because the MO doesn't fit with that yeah
[01:12:18.760 --> 01:12:21.400]  I just think it's interesting and then you know they find in this guy's locker
[01:12:21.400 --> 01:12:25.320]  that he's got these ISIS flags and all this stuff in there just seems a little
[01:12:25.320 --> 01:12:28.840]  well we know they've staged stuff before so I'm not this last week too though I
[01:12:28.840 --> 01:12:32.200]  said I even told David Knight I was like watch is gonna be a video that comes out
[01:12:32.200 --> 01:12:35.160]  from one of these guys something like that's gonna happen and here we are
[01:12:35.160 --> 01:12:39.400]  they have this video that's being released so the whole thing I think is
[01:12:39.400 --> 01:12:42.000]  just it stinks to high heaven and there's a lot well we know he was being
[01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:46.040]  handled by him we're all a lockie who handled a son at Fort Hood and who
[01:12:46.040 --> 01:12:49.840]  handled the underwear bomber and we know bare minimum they knew what was gonna
[01:12:49.840 --> 01:12:53.440]  happen and let it happen yeah I mean that came out in the news the CIA was
[01:12:53.440 --> 01:12:58.360]  watching it and basically let him manipulate a son into doing that so I
[01:12:58.360 --> 01:13:01.600]  want to know why he gets to die at the Pentagon that's the London Guardian what
[01:13:01.600 --> 01:13:05.200]  why is it why's a lockie I can play Colonel Schaefer saying he is a triple
[01:13:05.200 --> 01:13:10.960]  agent it's beyond triple agent yeah what do you think yeah I just don't get what
[01:13:10.960 --> 01:13:16.160]  we're doing we lock up innocent people for you know marijuana charges but when
[01:13:16.160 --> 01:13:20.320]  we let these guys go and commit these heinous acts or yeah they'd been in
[01:13:20.320 --> 01:13:23.680]  prison they were on Facebook saying they're going to attack why do we need
[01:13:23.680 --> 01:13:29.280]  more NSA surveillance to keep us safe when it doesn't keep us safe well they
[01:13:29.280 --> 01:13:31.880]  want people to be so scared they stay at home all the time and then they can
[01:13:31.880 --> 01:13:35.280]  monitor you at home with all those cameras and their TVs and your microwave
[01:13:35.280 --> 01:13:38.320]  and then your coffee machine it's just you're building they're trying to build
[01:13:38.320 --> 01:13:45.320]  you a prison system to live in your cage will be your home it is it's 1984 thank
[01:13:45.320 --> 01:13:49.400]  you so much Joe Bakes well there's the other take on it some of the listeners
[01:13:49.400 --> 01:13:53.600]  are criticizing me I'm saying the whole thing's fake it's all theater none of
[01:13:53.600 --> 01:13:58.320]  it happened no I mean the evidence is this really happened and now they're
[01:13:58.320 --> 01:14:02.880]  trying to take our liberties and take our free speech but separately the EU
[01:14:02.880 --> 01:14:07.200]  that champions restricting free speech on so many fronts and Lord Monty can
[01:14:07.200 --> 01:14:12.000]  speak to that is now having this big rally and then Obama's been criticized
[01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:15.920]  for not being there and I didn't that was a bad move and Obama is connected
[01:14:15.920 --> 01:14:19.760]  heavily to arming the ISIS rebels that we know helped arm and train these
[01:14:19.760 --> 01:14:23.860]  people that the girlfriend has now run through Turkey to Syria but Lord
[01:14:23.860 --> 01:14:28.840]  Monty has spoken out a lot about radical Islamification of Europe and again he
[01:14:28.840 --> 01:14:32.080]  founded the party that's promoting national sovereignty and basically
[01:14:32.080 --> 01:14:36.280]  getting out of the EU that's gaining a lot of seats in the EU Parliament and in
[01:14:36.280 --> 01:14:41.280]  the UK so he can speak to that I originally last week asked him to try
[01:14:41.280 --> 01:14:44.600]  to get him on this week about the record cold temperatures but still the
[01:14:44.600 --> 01:14:49.400]  carbon tax agenda rolls forward but Lord Monty of science and public policy dot
[01:14:49.400 --> 01:14:57.080]  ORG thank you so much for joining us he's a former businessman newspaper editor
[01:14:57.080 --> 01:15:01.720]  inventor classical architect trained orator and a high priest of climate
[01:15:01.720 --> 01:15:05.640]  skepticism he was special advisor to Margaret Thatcher prime minister from
[01:15:05.640 --> 01:15:10.280]  82 to 86 on leaving 10 downing he established a successful specialist
[01:15:10.280 --> 01:15:13.920]  consultancy company giving technical advice corporations and governments his
[01:15:13.920 --> 01:15:16.800]  knowledge of science and politics behind global warming is noted with its
[01:15:16.800 --> 01:15:21.000]  breadth and depth and he's traveled the world and I you can give him credit for
[01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:26.320]  waking up Australia to repeal carbon taxes he is a big deal and of course the
[01:15:26.320 --> 01:15:29.360]  media won't make him a big deal because they want to hide what he's done but he
[01:15:29.360 --> 01:15:32.880]  is a big deal he's a real celebrity of promoting
[01:15:32.880 --> 01:15:37.680]  renaissance and freedom worldwide and we can learn from him successful ways to
[01:15:37.680 --> 01:15:42.640]  counter this evil so he joins us to cover the waterfront Lord Monty and we
[01:15:42.640 --> 01:15:47.720]  should obviously start first with the tragic killings of 20 people by these
[01:15:47.720 --> 01:15:53.600]  radical jihadis in Paris and then the calls for defending free speech by
[01:15:53.600 --> 01:15:59.840]  culprits of attacking free speech well this is the extraordinary thing the
[01:15:59.840 --> 01:16:05.440]  jihadists did what they did because they didn't like some cartoons about Islam
[01:16:05.440 --> 01:16:12.200]  that had appeared in Charlie Hebdo and so free speech is all very well if you
[01:16:12.200 --> 01:16:17.640]  happen to be pro-islamic but if you want to say anything that questions Islam you
[01:16:17.640 --> 01:16:22.520]  have to be very careful indeed or the terrorist will come after you and of
[01:16:22.520 --> 01:16:26.880]  course the EU has been trying to shut down free speech for some time if you
[01:16:26.880 --> 01:16:31.200]  are an EU functionary even if you're just a cleaner it says in your contract
[01:16:31.200 --> 01:16:35.480]  that you may not say anything that in any way questions the political
[01:16:35.480 --> 01:16:41.800]  desirability or efficiency of the EU because if you do they can sack you and
[01:16:41.800 --> 01:16:47.640]  penalize you and cost you your pension they buy the silence of those who work
[01:16:47.640 --> 01:16:52.320]  for them and this includes of course the members of the European Parliament
[01:16:52.320 --> 01:16:57.960]  itself they too are beginning to be limited in what they can say about the
[01:16:57.960 --> 01:17:04.320]  EU which makes it rather difficult for my party UKIP which now has 24 members of
[01:17:04.320 --> 01:17:09.160]  the European Parliament we are the largest party from Britain in the
[01:17:09.160 --> 01:17:15.040]  European Parliament as of last year's elections and we as you can imagine are
[01:17:15.040 --> 01:17:20.080]  doing our best first of all to defend free speech then to make sure that in
[01:17:20.080 --> 01:17:27.240]  Britain we are free not to let so many Muslim immigrants in if we choose not
[01:17:27.240 --> 01:17:31.760]  to because at the moment the EU is adopting what is more or less an open
[01:17:31.760 --> 01:17:35.200]  borders policy people can come in from all over the place there are virtually
[01:17:35.200 --> 01:17:40.680]  no controls unless you try to get into the UK we still maintain some control
[01:17:40.680 --> 01:17:44.320]  that's the socialist game plan with Obama opening the borders to bring in
[01:17:44.320 --> 01:17:52.320]  groups that will vote socialist here's the thing in France 93% of the eight or
[01:17:52.320 --> 01:17:57.040]  nine million Muslims who are now in France how they got their goodness knows
[01:17:57.040 --> 01:18:02.680]  but the eight or nine million of them 93% of those voted socialist and of
[01:18:02.680 --> 01:18:07.760]  course Monsieur Hollande who's the president of France came out and said
[01:18:07.760 --> 01:18:12.960]  of course these terrorist acts have got nothing at all to do with Islam but it's
[01:18:12.960 --> 01:18:17.880]  time he came off the Kool-Aid of course they are to do with Islam 95% of all
[01:18:17.880 --> 01:18:23.000]  terrorist acts around the world over the last 20 years including specifically
[01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:28.000]  the ones in Paris were committed in the name of Allah by people shrieking Allah
[01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:33.800]  who Akbar and what is happening are the moderate Muslim clerics speaking out and
[01:18:33.800 --> 01:18:37.920]  condemning the extremists this is what worries me there is a frightening
[01:18:37.920 --> 01:18:42.640]  silence from what is supposed to be moderate Islam in the face of these
[01:18:42.640 --> 01:18:47.480]  terrorist attacks and what you get from Hollande you get a craven statement but
[01:18:47.480 --> 01:18:51.320]  this has nothing to do with Islam when it blindingly obviously has but of course
[01:18:51.320 --> 01:18:57.960]  he doesn't want to offend those 93% of the eight or nine million Muslims in
[01:18:57.960 --> 01:19:03.960]  France who voted for him last time why does Islam always vote left in those
[01:19:03.960 --> 01:19:09.000]  countries where it gets in the answer of course is that Islam is a totalitarian
[01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:15.880]  religion and the left because Islam votes left will always open its borders to let
[01:19:15.880 --> 01:19:23.320]  more Muslims in Tony Blair did it Cameron in Britain who is indistinguishable
[01:19:23.320 --> 01:19:27.280]  from a socialist he's doing it they're pouring in on every plane and every boat
[01:19:27.280 --> 01:19:33.440]  very little steps are being taken to stop it we do still retain the freedom to
[01:19:33.440 --> 01:19:36.640]  stop it provided they come from anywhere other than Europe but our trouble
[01:19:36.640 --> 01:19:42.840]  trouble is but if they come in from the European Union then our right to stop
[01:19:42.840 --> 01:19:46.840]  them and turn them away is very severely respected and then people like Michael
[01:19:46.840 --> 01:19:51.680]  Savage of our own country exactly the people like Michael Savage risk of this
[01:19:51.680 --> 01:19:55.880]  network break who was gonna go speak about the threat of radical Islam in
[01:19:55.880 --> 01:20:00.560]  England is banned from entering the UK and they're adding hundreds of people to
[01:20:00.560 --> 01:20:05.160]  it and I was warned when I came in they had different groups of police meet me
[01:20:05.160 --> 01:20:09.600]  and just show up at the hotel that hey you better not criticize Islam while
[01:20:09.600 --> 01:20:13.760]  you're here I'm not somebody that's ever even been attacking because there are a
[01:20:13.760 --> 01:20:16.320]  lot of Muslims that I think are nice people and aren't radical but you're
[01:20:16.320 --> 01:20:20.100]  right what dominates it is the totalitarian angle and they've
[01:20:20.100 --> 01:20:23.880]  intimidated the non-radical Muslims and the West seems to be backing radical
[01:20:23.880 --> 01:20:28.140]  Muslims through Saudi Arabia taking over the Middle East and Africa and so it
[01:20:28.140 --> 01:20:33.200]  looks like they are really a protected group well even if I agreed with Islam I
[01:20:33.200 --> 01:20:36.840]  would be mad as a libertarian with the fact that they get special treatment
[01:20:36.840 --> 01:20:40.640]  you're not allowed to criticize them that's frightening that they let jihadi
[01:20:40.640 --> 01:20:45.960]  preachers get up and preach from terror attacks on UK television but that Michael
[01:20:45.960 --> 01:20:51.120]  Savage can't come into the country that's chilling well this is something
[01:20:51.120 --> 01:20:55.960]  which I think is very dangerous indeed I'm very sorry but Michael Savage has
[01:20:55.960 --> 01:21:01.280]  been banned yes he speaks strongly as do you as sometimes do I but does this
[01:21:01.280 --> 01:21:05.480]  mean we ought to be silenced no what is happening is that free speech is
[01:21:05.480 --> 01:21:10.320]  rapidly vanishing in favor of what is politically correct and of course what
[01:21:10.320 --> 01:21:13.240]  is politically correct means what is politically left-wing if it's left-wing
[01:21:13.240 --> 01:21:18.000]  it's correct under this new disposition and if you're not left-wing then you are
[01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:21.280]  going to be silenced and they've tried this on the climate they've tried this
[01:21:21.280 --> 01:21:26.080]  on Islam they're doing it on various subjects and the danger that I see is
[01:21:26.080 --> 01:21:31.360]  that the media most of which are also now left-wing anyway are willing to go
[01:21:31.360 --> 01:21:36.120]  along with this gradual circumscription of free speech and of course you also
[01:21:36.120 --> 01:21:40.960]  see it very dangerously indeed in the universities the places that used to be
[01:21:40.960 --> 01:21:44.600]  places of light of liberty and of learning in this really great phrase
[01:21:44.600 --> 01:21:50.920]  now you can scrub liberty and light and learning now it's doctrine doctrine and
[01:21:50.920 --> 01:21:55.120]  doctrine left-wing doctrine Islamist doctrine anti-christian doctrine
[01:21:55.120 --> 01:22:00.160]  anti-western doctrine throughout the universities this is a very extraordinary
[01:22:00.160 --> 01:22:06.760]  moment for the West because the West is busy abdicating all the reasons for its
[01:22:06.760 --> 01:22:11.360]  greatness our freedom of speech our liberty of expression our freedom of
[01:22:11.360 --> 01:22:14.680]  movement our freedom of action our freedom to form and un-make companies
[01:22:14.680 --> 01:22:19.480]  our freedom to keep most of our own earnings our freedom to say what we want
[01:22:19.480 --> 01:22:24.160]  to say all be it to be polite and not to be libelous but at least to speak
[01:22:24.160 --> 01:22:30.400]  freely all these freedoms are now almost extinct that's right and the West is
[01:22:30.400 --> 01:22:37.840]  committing suicide on the altar of socialist communist collectivist failure
[01:22:37.840 --> 01:22:43.440]  this is the tragedy because socialism has failed the welfare state has gone
[01:22:43.440 --> 01:22:48.840]  bankrupt everywhere in the United States the national debt has doubled in the
[01:22:48.840 --> 01:22:52.760]  lifetime of this president in office we'll call him a president though he
[01:22:52.760 --> 01:22:56.720]  isn't really likewise in the United Kingdom in the lifetime of just one
[01:22:56.720 --> 01:23:01.760]  parliament only five years the national debt of Britain which took 250 years to
[01:23:01.760 --> 01:23:07.400]  accumulate has doubled in just five years why because the welfare state is out
[01:23:07.400 --> 01:23:11.840]  of control and part of that of course is uncontrolled immigration and people
[01:23:11.840 --> 01:23:14.720]  arriving in the airport going straight to their compatriots who work in the
[01:23:14.720 --> 01:23:18.680]  benefit offices claiming large benefits and free operations on the national
[01:23:18.680 --> 01:23:21.520]  health service from the British taxpayer though they have no right to them
[01:23:21.520 --> 01:23:25.240]  everybody's taxpayer therefore has to queue and wait and stop is it cloured and
[01:23:25.240 --> 01:23:30.640]  piven the end game but bankrupt the West and then bring in total collectivism I
[01:23:30.640 --> 01:23:35.360]  mean this is a nightmare scenario and as you said we've had a doubling or an
[01:23:35.360 --> 01:23:39.880]  exponential growth in just the last five years in the West of debt other
[01:23:39.880 --> 01:23:44.160]  European countries are going bankrupt as we speak what is the end game and how
[01:23:44.160 --> 01:23:49.600]  long until it all collapses well this is a very good question I have a cousin who
[01:23:49.600 --> 01:23:54.240]  is very high up in the financial world and he reckons about six months and
[01:23:54.240 --> 01:23:59.120]  it's going to fall apart he said the the debt has gone way beyond what is
[01:23:59.120 --> 01:24:03.560]  sustainable and in Britain it could even happen sooner because if as I suspect
[01:24:03.560 --> 01:24:07.720]  we will we end up with a socialist government after our general elections in
[01:24:07.720 --> 01:24:12.880]  May this year just a few months away now then the stock market here and then
[01:24:12.880 --> 01:24:17.240]  worldwide will collapse more or less immediately so I'm busy repositioning
[01:24:17.240 --> 01:24:21.200]  myself to get out of the stock market into other things gold silver look good
[01:24:21.200 --> 01:24:24.680]  they haven't gone up much in the last five years but I think they suddenly
[01:24:24.680 --> 01:24:28.880]  will when everything begins to collapse it's very good news of course that the
[01:24:28.880 --> 01:24:34.640]  oil price has fallen that's actually been a benefit to the Western economies
[01:24:34.640 --> 01:24:39.240]  though paradoxically the stock markets have gone down in response to that
[01:24:39.240 --> 01:24:45.640]  because they sense and I think rightly that there is an instability but because
[01:24:45.640 --> 01:24:51.640]  the one cartel which is permitted in international law when all others are
[01:24:51.640 --> 01:24:56.400]  banned by the World Trade Organization is of course the oil cartel and people
[01:24:56.400 --> 01:25:01.120]  are beginning to be reminded that Saudi Arabia still controls that cartel and it
[01:25:01.120 --> 01:25:06.040]  is trying at the moment to shut down all the shale gas and shale oil operations
[01:25:06.040 --> 01:25:11.400]  in Canada in the United States in Britain in Poland why because they don't
[01:25:11.400 --> 01:25:17.400]  want to find that we can start drilling for our oil rather than them selling it
[01:25:17.400 --> 01:25:21.400]  to us so they're trying to knock us out of the market by using their cartel power
[01:25:21.400 --> 01:25:25.920]  and I think it's time that the West stood up to Saudi Arabia not only of course
[01:25:25.920 --> 01:25:29.720]  on the oil cartel but also on the matter of its funding of a particularly
[01:25:29.720 --> 01:25:33.760]  extreme version of Islam the wildest version of Islam which they're
[01:25:33.760 --> 01:25:36.840]  spreading right across the Muslim crescent to the south of Russia right
[01:25:36.840 --> 01:25:41.080]  into Pakistan and as you said earlier right down into Africa now I think we
[01:25:41.080 --> 01:25:45.400]  have to be careful with our language when we talk about Islam I don't think we
[01:25:45.400 --> 01:25:51.240]  should simply quote the admittedly very extreme passages in the Quran which
[01:25:51.240 --> 01:25:56.600]  abrogate the more gentle passages the passages that let's say you know you
[01:25:56.600 --> 01:26:00.360]  should kill non-Muslims wherever you find them and wherever you can these
[01:26:00.360 --> 01:26:04.120]  passages are there they do take precedence over the moderate passages but
[01:26:04.120 --> 01:26:09.040]  most Muslims and we must give them credit for this realize that their holy book
[01:26:09.040 --> 01:26:13.160]  in that respect is nonsense and they do not behave in that way and they do not
[01:26:13.160 --> 01:26:21.400]  support those who do so I think that like you I am a friend of moderate Islam
[01:26:21.400 --> 01:26:25.360]  because in many respects it shares our values for instance you and I don't like
[01:26:25.360 --> 01:26:31.320]  baby butchering and nor does official Islam like baby butchering so that we
[01:26:31.320 --> 01:26:36.040]  do have some moral standards in common on which I think we should build but
[01:26:36.040 --> 01:26:40.840]  simply to give in to Islam in the way that left-wing governments like that of
[01:26:40.840 --> 01:26:45.760]  Monsieur Hollande are doing worldwide that's when you get terrorism if you
[01:26:45.760 --> 01:26:51.240]  look weak and you have a socialist administration then in come the terrorists
[01:26:51.240 --> 01:26:55.320]  because they know that you get exactly the kind of rhetoric that Hollande came
[01:26:55.320 --> 01:26:59.320]  out with trying to say that this was nothing to do with Islam this is a real
[01:26:59.320 --> 01:27:03.120]  danger if we cannot get our politician to speak the truth because they
[01:27:03.120 --> 01:27:07.320]  themselves have become frightened by the terrorists then we need more muscular
[01:27:07.320 --> 01:27:12.040]  politicians well it shows the complete surrender of the socialist who have a
[01:27:12.040 --> 01:27:16.640]  hundred plus percent tax rate on the middle class in France I'm not joking
[01:27:16.640 --> 01:27:20.560]  folks that's associated press 101 percent tax rate to fully bankrupt their
[01:27:20.560 --> 01:27:23.920]  enemies and the socialists have been found with Swiss bank accounts so they're
[01:27:23.920 --> 01:27:29.520]  exempt from it as they always operate as EU dictators and we use that term Lord
[01:27:29.520 --> 01:27:35.000]  Montaghan back up the statistics they are dictatorial Benjamin Netanyahu it's
[01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:38.760]  now being reported regardless of what you think of him was told by the French
[01:27:38.760 --> 01:27:43.520]  president don't march with us but Netanyahu still did it regardless I mean
[01:27:43.520 --> 01:27:51.240]  that that shows how much the radical Islamic system has happened that they're
[01:27:51.240 --> 01:27:55.600]  going to tell a foreign president you can't march with us I mean this is
[01:27:55.600 --> 01:28:01.640]  really getting bizarre well it is and I think it shows the weakness and
[01:28:01.640 --> 01:28:06.840]  intellectual bankruptcy of the left worldwide this is an extraordinary
[01:28:06.840 --> 01:28:12.000]  feature of what's going on in the world now the left are wrong objectively
[01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:18.080]  speaking about everything they're wrong to pander to extremist Islam they're
[01:28:18.080 --> 01:28:23.040]  wrong about the climate they're wrong about the environment they're wrong about
[01:28:23.040 --> 01:28:28.560]  the economy they're wrong about the welfare state wrong on any rational
[01:28:28.560 --> 01:28:34.920]  measure and yet they prevail in all the bureaucratic institutions most
[01:28:34.920 --> 01:28:39.120]  bureaucracies in government most bureaucracies like the UN the supranational
[01:28:39.120 --> 01:28:43.720]  bureaucracies these left-wing bureaucracies are under the thumb of the
[01:28:43.720 --> 01:28:47.960]  extreme left and they're wrong about everything relentlessly
[01:28:47.960 --> 01:28:52.480]  determinately wrong and the wronger they are the shriller they get in trying to
[01:28:52.480 --> 01:28:56.800]  insist that they're right and I think it's only a matter of time before the
[01:28:56.800 --> 01:29:02.480]  world begins to wake up and come off the Kool-Aid and realize that we can't any
[01:29:02.480 --> 01:29:09.080]  longer indulge the fantasies of the left they are bidding fair and some of them
[01:29:09.080 --> 01:29:14.120]  deliberately bidding fair to destroy the West in various ways sure I'm part of
[01:29:14.120 --> 01:29:17.840]  that the undermining of the economy that they can't compete with free market
[01:29:17.840 --> 01:29:23.000]  prosperity Lord Moncton Lord Christopher Moncton is our guest amazing his website

[01:29:27.600 --> 01:29:32.240]  the next six months the next year we can see a lot of signs of that then what
[01:29:32.240 --> 01:29:35.840]  comes out of it how do we defeat the culture battle that they're planning to
[01:29:35.840 --> 01:29:40.720]  use the crisis to sell more socialism as the answer how do we defeat that the
[01:29:40.720 --> 01:29:44.960]  most shift gears into what's happening with the climate carbon taxes record cold

[01:33:28.360 --> 01:33:33.440]  his website science and public policy dot org that climate depot here in the
[01:33:33.440 --> 01:33:39.500]  US our daily visits the scientific reports the analysis the predictions they
[01:33:39.500 --> 01:33:46.000]  all came true with stunning accuracy Lord Moncton never over announced his case
[01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:50.660]  he really just laid it all out and he's been proven right the UN responded five
[01:33:50.660 --> 01:33:53.980]  years ago when he helped get the secret documents of their real treaty to
[01:33:53.980 --> 01:33:57.820]  basically double third-world taxes that claimed it was a wealth transfer to the
[01:33:57.820 --> 01:34:02.820]  third world in carbon tax and Lord Moncton was able to get the secret
[01:34:02.820 --> 01:34:06.220]  treaty and of course didn't get any credit for that he was locked out of the
[01:34:06.220 --> 01:34:10.940]  one in Durban South Africa two years ago so he parachuted into that and you
[01:34:10.940 --> 01:34:15.100]  can't make this stuff up and they have to keep these treaties secret just like
[01:34:15.100 --> 01:34:20.980]  the Trans Pacific partnerships and the other ones because when we get them it
[01:34:20.980 --> 01:34:27.380]  is pure global government totalitarian garbage that is being forced down our
[01:34:27.380 --> 01:34:32.260]  throats we're gonna be talking to him in a moment about what's coming next we've
[01:34:32.260 --> 01:34:39.380]  seen record cold temperatures snow in Hawaii snow in Florida and their
[01:34:39.380 --> 01:34:43.300]  answer is OC that's the climate change no longer global warming well of course
[01:34:43.300 --> 01:34:47.260]  the climate's always changing and they had a vote five years ago at the
[01:34:47.260 --> 01:34:53.140]  Copenhagen event or six years ago now they had a vote and they voted and said
[01:34:53.140 --> 01:34:56.660]  the Sun does not affect climate because they knew all these scientists were
[01:34:56.660 --> 01:35:00.420]  coming out saying it's the Sun it's the Sun not carbon dioxide that plants live

[01:36:29.100 --> 01:36:33.860]  I mean bathing suits not a big deal there's one pent up girl in here putting
[01:36:33.860 --> 01:36:38.740]  down the outgoing senator so he's got me giving the first speech since the
[01:36:38.740 --> 01:36:43.100]  Alamo was destroyed at the Alamo since the state opened it up to speeches when
[01:36:43.100 --> 01:36:50.780]  the ag commissioner hand me down there to speak info or store.com or 888-253-3139
[01:36:50.780 --> 01:36:54.220]  and they will sell out in the next day or two it was just a test to see if
[01:36:54.220 --> 01:36:57.860]  folks liked the calendar and the answer is yes folks love the calendar but it's
[01:36:57.860 --> 01:37:03.060]  basically a real coupon book I mean you could save thousands of dollars with
[01:37:03.060 --> 01:37:07.380]  this if you took advantage of all the coupons that are in it and it's not a
[01:37:07.380 --> 01:37:11.420]  gimmick these are real discounts finally speaking of real discounts we have the

[01:37:48.340 --> 01:37:52.940]  pair of money a year MSNBC that gets billions and you know tax write-offs
[01:37:52.940 --> 01:37:56.620]  that they're especially given or stimulus money we're funded by you
[01:37:56.620 --> 01:38:00.300]  spreading the word supporting the sponsors and buying the products at
[01:38:00.300 --> 01:38:05.740]  infowarslife.com and a lot of times when guests like Lord Monkton or others
[01:38:05.740 --> 01:38:09.380]  aren't getting mainstream media coverage I know this show has been critical
[01:38:09.380 --> 01:38:13.660]  in getting it out there forcing it out there thanks to you are activist audience
[01:38:13.660 --> 01:38:18.140]  so I salute all of you out there worldwide not just here in the United
[01:38:18.140 --> 01:38:21.780]  States now Lord Monkton I'm gonna try to give you the floor now to go over this
[01:38:21.780 --> 01:38:26.180]  we'll be showing some of the headlines while you speak but penguins for the
[01:38:26.180 --> 01:38:31.100]  first time taking cover in Antarctica ice sheets growing at record levels sea
[01:38:31.100 --> 01:38:35.500]  levels in many areas dropping some areas rising slightly we know they go up and
[01:38:35.500 --> 01:38:41.580]  down just absolute evidence that the earth has been slowing its heating and
[01:38:41.580 --> 01:38:46.220]  now is cooling due to the sun as you and other scientists together laid it out
[01:38:46.220 --> 01:38:50.820]  doesn't matter multiple states are implementing carbon taxes by fiat
[01:38:50.820 --> 01:38:55.340]  Obama's going forward with executive action to shut down more power plants I
[01:38:55.340 --> 01:39:00.220]  mean this is a plan to bankrupt us England is a test example what is
[01:39:00.220 --> 01:39:05.380]  happening in the fight right now on that front that that you've been leading the
[01:39:05.380 --> 01:39:11.820]  first thing is that I've now had a paper published today in the Chinese
[01:39:11.820 --> 01:39:16.100]  science bulletin now this is a big deal it's one of the top six science journals
[01:39:16.100 --> 01:39:20.020]  in the world it is the bulletin of the Chinese Academy of Sciences which is the
[01:39:20.020 --> 01:39:26.380]  largest Academy of Sciences in the world and this paper explains what went wrong
[01:39:26.380 --> 01:39:31.940]  in the climate models to make everybody think that there might be a lot rather
[01:39:31.940 --> 01:39:37.020]  than virtually no global warming as a result of our adding carbon dioxide to
[01:39:37.020 --> 01:39:42.020]  the atmosphere you see here's a fact which can be which bears repetition and
[01:39:42.020 --> 01:39:46.060]  you did this with a bunch of top scientists I mean oh yeah also add who
[01:39:46.060 --> 01:39:50.620]  you co-authored it with that's right yes it's with Dr. Willie soon of the
[01:39:50.620 --> 01:39:54.860]  Harvard Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics a solar physicist with
[01:39:54.860 --> 01:40:00.100]  Professor David Legate he's a professor of geography at the University of
[01:40:00.100 --> 01:40:04.180]  Delaware and also with Matt Briggs who's known as the statistician to the
[01:40:04.180 --> 01:40:08.380]  stars in New York so three very distinguished co-authors I was the
[01:40:08.380 --> 01:40:13.700]  lead author and what we did was to present a new irreducibly simple climate
[01:40:13.700 --> 01:40:18.220]  model which any student of physics can work on his pocket calculator if he
[01:40:18.220 --> 01:40:23.340]  wants and it allows you to get more accurate forecasts of what's going to
[01:40:23.340 --> 01:40:26.900]  happen to global temperature as a result of our adding greenhouse gases to the
[01:40:26.900 --> 01:40:30.700]  atmosphere than the big climate models that have got it wrong time and time and
[01:40:30.700 --> 01:40:35.140]  time again we've been able to go into the big models we found the mistakes
[01:40:35.140 --> 01:40:40.580]  they've made we've exposed in this leading paper in the first issue of an
[01:40:40.580 --> 01:40:44.540]  of this newly relaunched journal is now being launched onto the world stage is
[01:40:44.540 --> 01:40:50.300]  no longer just a Chinese journal and this paper explains where they got it
[01:40:50.300 --> 01:40:54.380]  wrong how they got it wrong why they got it wrong and what it means that they
[01:40:54.380 --> 01:40:59.980]  got it wrong what it means is we're going to see not more than one Celsius degree
[01:40:59.980 --> 01:41:05.940]  of global warming this century and it might be a lot less than that and even
[01:41:05.940 --> 01:41:12.260]  if we were to burn off all the affordably recoverable fossil fuels in the
[01:41:12.260 --> 01:41:17.380]  world global temperatures compared with now would rise by about 2.2 Celsius
[01:41:17.380 --> 01:41:24.060]  degrees and that's about it so there is no climate problem there never was and
[01:41:24.060 --> 01:41:31.100]  we have now proved it and this paper is already spreading like wildfire among
[01:41:31.100 --> 01:41:35.020]  the institutions we're now making arrangements thanks to the Heartland
[01:41:35.020 --> 01:41:40.220]  Institute for it to go open access which is quite an expensive option but that
[01:41:40.220 --> 01:41:45.980]  means that within the week everyone even if they don't subscribe to the Chinese
[01:41:45.980 --> 01:41:50.740]  science bulletin will be able to get a copy of this picture of this paper from
[01:41:50.740 --> 01:41:56.580]  Springer.com the publishers and this paper is going to turn climate science
[01:41:56.580 --> 01:42:01.420]  on its head because it shows that they've made some really elementary really
[01:42:01.420 --> 01:42:06.500]  stupid errors which led to the mistaken belief that adding a little CO2 to the
[01:42:06.500 --> 01:42:11.580]  atmosphere would make a huge difference the fact is that to the nearest tenth of
[01:42:11.580 --> 01:42:17.980]  one percent there isn't any CO2 in the atmosphere that's how little of it there
[01:42:17.980 --> 01:42:23.020]  is and yes even that small amount can make some difference but is it going to
[01:42:23.020 --> 01:42:26.180]  make enough of a difference to melt the ice sheets no as you've just mentioned
[01:42:26.180 --> 01:42:33.660]  the ice sheets have in fact grown to record extent just three months ago the
[01:42:33.660 --> 01:42:38.900]  ice sheets of the North and South Poles added together were a greater extent
[01:42:38.900 --> 01:42:43.300]  than ever measured before in the satellite era the only place you'll hear
[01:42:43.300 --> 01:42:47.620]  that information is on info wars.com you won't hear that in any mainstream
[01:42:47.620 --> 01:42:52.020]  news medium they will not tell you this fact they will not tell you that sea
[01:42:52.020 --> 01:42:56.140]  level basically isn't rising at all it might rise according to the world's
[01:42:56.140 --> 01:43:01.540]  greatest expert on the subject by a matter of perhaps inches maybe two maybe
[01:43:01.540 --> 01:43:07.100]  four maybe six inches over the whole of the 21st century is this a problem no
[01:43:07.100 --> 01:43:11.100]  it's not not even to cover the spats on my highly polished shoes the whole thing
[01:43:11.100 --> 01:43:17.500]  is nonsense the deserts are shrinking as rainfall is bringing is greening air
[01:43:17.500 --> 01:43:21.060]  areas that the no man's haven't been able to live in since living memory now
[01:43:21.060 --> 01:43:25.300]  they're moving back 30,000 square kilometers of the Sahara has disappeared
[01:43:25.300 --> 01:43:29.780]  under vegetation it's good news right across the globe hurricanes are down
[01:43:29.780 --> 01:43:34.860]  floods virtually no change the area of the world under drought has declined over
[01:43:34.860 --> 01:43:40.420]  the last 30 years none of these things is being mentioned in any mainstream news
[01:43:40.420 --> 01:43:45.980]  means what we've done is to go right into the models expose where they got it
[01:43:45.980 --> 01:43:50.180]  wrong and now it's going to be very much harder for them from now on to
[01:43:50.180 --> 01:43:54.540]  pretend that they have to do anything at all about introducing world government
[01:43:54.540 --> 01:43:58.820]  in Paris in December this year which is what they are still unfortunately
[01:43:58.820 --> 01:44:02.140]  planning to do and that was my next question you read my mind I wanted to
[01:44:02.140 --> 01:44:05.060]  get into what the Pope said and the rest of it but just going back you're
[01:44:05.060 --> 01:44:09.660]  being very gentlemanly and very kind we have the emails we have climate gate
[01:44:09.660 --> 01:44:15.740]  that you helped expose we know that it's premeditated fraud to pass carbon
[01:44:15.740 --> 01:44:21.380]  taxes because if you can tax carbon dioxide that that that humans exhale as
[01:44:21.380 --> 01:44:24.900]  the New York Times said attacks on breathing you can micromanage and
[01:44:24.900 --> 01:44:29.100]  surveil every level of the economy selectively shutting off whoever you
[01:44:29.100 --> 01:44:35.300]  want shut off UK shut off US shut off EU production the bureaucrats then their
[01:44:35.300 --> 01:44:40.220]  wives and husbands literally own the factories and cold plants in China and
[01:44:40.220 --> 01:44:45.020]  India and then they move there I mean this is paying the dismantle Europe
[01:44:45.020 --> 01:44:50.260]  paying the dismantle the US a premeditated wicked plan I mean is there
[01:44:50.260 --> 01:44:54.020]  any doubt now you certainly have those because of political pressure I go to
[01:44:54.020 --> 01:44:56.980]  the movies now and I went to two different theaters the last month
[01:44:56.980 --> 01:45:02.500]  different chains they had documentaries about islands in the Pacific that are
[01:45:02.500 --> 01:45:06.260]  going to be underwater now which we all know is a fraud and please do you know
[01:45:06.260 --> 01:45:10.340]  you know don't kill us with these natives begging the propaganda push has
[01:45:10.340 --> 01:45:14.820]  been quadrupled from what I've seen and then the Pope and I'm not a Catholic
[01:45:14.820 --> 01:45:23.380]  masher I believe you're a Catholic he has begun to come out with some rather
[01:45:23.380 --> 01:45:29.060]  silly noises about climate change he is of course on the far left himself and
[01:45:29.060 --> 01:45:35.500]  he has an even more radical prefect of the Pontifical Academy of Sciences
[01:45:35.500 --> 01:45:42.220]  Monsignor Sanchez Sorondo now I had lunch at the Pontifical Academy with
[01:45:42.220 --> 01:45:45.820]  Sanchez Sorondo under the beautiful painted ceiling they live very well at
[01:45:45.820 --> 01:45:51.740]  the Vatican and this was about three years ago and he had on one side of him
[01:45:51.740 --> 01:45:55.100]  me and on the other side of him Italy's most distinguished scientist Professor
[01:45:55.100 --> 01:46:00.500]  Antonino Zikiki who's the founder and still head at the age of 86 of the
[01:46:00.500 --> 01:46:06.740]  World Federation of Scientists and both of us told Sanchez Sorondo that there is
[01:46:06.740 --> 01:46:12.980]  no basis for concern about our effect on the climate it's minimal and in those
[01:46:12.980 --> 01:46:16.300]  countries of the West where we have got the environment we've cleaned up the
[01:46:16.300 --> 01:46:22.860]  act we've cleaned up pollution there's really no threat to wildlife or to us
[01:46:22.860 --> 01:46:28.420]  or to plants or to anything from the activities of man in the poorer
[01:46:28.420 --> 01:46:33.580]  countries there still is in China real pollution they the they don't burn coal
[01:46:33.580 --> 01:46:37.940]  very cleanly for instance they could do but they don't yet and there you do get
[01:46:37.940 --> 01:46:42.860]  genuine pollution but CO2 is not a pollutant but the Pope is planning to
[01:46:42.860 --> 01:46:48.420]  issue in March of this year just a couple of months away and encyclical
[01:46:48.420 --> 01:46:53.980]  letter this is a letter to all 400,000 clergy and all the 1.2 billion
[01:46:53.980 --> 01:46:59.660]  Catholic faithful saying to them that they must now put the climate before
[01:46:59.660 --> 01:47:05.380]  their religion and they must start saying that unless the West is shut down
[01:47:05.380 --> 01:47:10.180]  the world is doomed now that's the line we are hearing from the Vatican at the
[01:47:10.180 --> 01:47:16.460]  moment I am hoping that the more old-fashioned members of the Curia
[01:47:16.460 --> 01:47:22.300]  advising the Pope will say to him look mate we've got this wrong before with
[01:47:22.300 --> 01:47:27.740]  Galileo trying to get him to pretend that the earth doesn't go around the sun
[01:47:27.740 --> 01:47:33.180]  we were wrong on that we are not infallible on matters of science only
[01:47:33.180 --> 01:47:39.500]  on matters of faith or doctrine be very careful and so if Pope Francis watches
[01:47:39.500 --> 01:47:43.340]  and listens to your program regularly as I'm sure he does and here's a warning to
[01:47:43.340 --> 01:47:49.580]  him keep proper restraint it's not the business of the church to speak out on
[01:47:49.580 --> 01:47:54.380]  scientific questions nor is it the business of the church to take sides in
[01:47:54.380 --> 01:47:58.980]  what is frankly a highly partisan political dispute between the left and
[01:47:58.980 --> 01:48:02.860]  the rest of the world the left are promoting the climate agenda the harder
[01:48:02.860 --> 01:48:06.740]  the left the harder they push it and their entire religion anti-Catholic
[01:48:06.740 --> 01:48:10.740]  let me let me expand on this point because this is the key you've done
[01:48:10.740 --> 01:48:15.740]  equations and I've seen similar ones and of course this came up when we got
[01:48:15.740 --> 01:48:20.740]  the UN treaty planned five years ago at Copenhagen that it would almost double
[01:48:20.740 --> 01:48:25.180]  right at double the taxes on the third world so it's not a big wealth transfer
[01:48:25.180 --> 01:48:29.740]  like it's been billed by the socialist it's a giant swindle and allows them to
[01:48:29.740 --> 01:48:34.340]  control energy but if the Catholic Church or Christians period are pro-life
[01:48:34.340 --> 01:48:39.020]  this is a death sentence when Obama says you can't have industrialization in
[01:48:39.020 --> 01:48:43.860]  Africa you can't have a car or an air conditioner that is a very very fair
[01:48:43.860 --> 01:48:49.540]  point and it's a point that I hope a mature encyclical will look at I think
[01:48:49.540 --> 01:48:54.060]  that I would like to see the Holy See being a bit brave here as the previous
[01:48:54.060 --> 01:48:59.340]  Pope was and what he said about all this is that yes the scientists are
[01:48:59.340 --> 01:49:04.420]  expressing concern however there are also scientists expressing concern that the
[01:49:04.420 --> 01:49:08.700]  scientists expressing concern have overig the pudding and therefore there are
[01:49:08.700 --> 01:49:14.220]  two sides to this and the previous Pope said and quite rightly said that it is
[01:49:14.220 --> 01:49:20.780]  not for those who are backed by governments who want this nonsense to
[01:49:20.780 --> 01:49:25.620]  try to silence those of us who are doing perfectly good science questioning this
[01:49:25.620 --> 01:49:30.300]  we must be allowed access to the journals and to be fair to the Chinese
[01:49:30.300 --> 01:49:35.500]  Academy of Sciences which reviewed this I may say at a very high level before
[01:49:35.500 --> 01:49:41.180]  letting it be published they in the end accepted that we had made a sound
[01:49:41.180 --> 01:49:46.340]  scientific argument there isn't a problem with the climate and therefore
[01:49:46.340 --> 01:49:51.260]  they were willing to print it now virtually no Western journal of the
[01:49:51.260 --> 01:49:57.180]  same standing would have even sent our paper out for review that's how far
[01:49:57.180 --> 01:50:01.300]  Western science control but shifting your back to the Catholic issue yeah you
[01:50:01.300 --> 01:50:05.220]  you said it what in the first ten years of the carbon taxes as it was in the
[01:50:05.220 --> 01:50:10.660]  treaty a billion dead correct so isn't this a pro-life issue that more I mean
[01:50:10.660 --> 01:50:16.860]  I don't I can't put that kind of figure on it what I can say is that the number
[01:50:16.860 --> 01:50:21.580]  of people killed will be very large you just even if you take a prosperous
[01:50:21.580 --> 01:50:26.660]  country like Britain a three years ago we had an unusually cold winter in which
[01:50:26.660 --> 01:50:31.860]  20,000 people died wow and that's something like 12,000 more than would

[01:54:57.860 --> 01:55:02.420]  segment and the next Christopher Monkton joins us we were talking during the
[01:55:02.420 --> 01:55:04.580]  break and you repeat what you were saying because I was trying to go back in
[01:55:04.580 --> 01:55:08.740]  memory to your billion term you were saying oh no the agenda to reduce the
[01:55:08.740 --> 01:55:13.380]  population get into the UN and the globalist and Ted Turner's own master
[01:55:13.380 --> 01:55:19.020]  plan what's behind wanting to shut off the energy supply the world what they
[01:55:19.020 --> 01:55:24.500]  want to do is reduce the population not by one billion but two one billion it's
[01:55:24.500 --> 01:55:29.780]  now seven point two billion they want to cut the population by six point two
[01:55:29.780 --> 01:55:36.540]  billion they don't care how many people die of starvation or cold or disease as
[01:55:36.540 --> 01:55:41.860]  long as the population is reduced so that they will be even richer because the
[01:55:41.860 --> 01:55:46.300]  poor people won't be consuming all those resources worldwide that's what this is
[01:55:46.300 --> 01:55:51.020]  about it's a conspiracy it's what the French would call it ties on declare but
[01:55:51.020 --> 01:55:56.260]  this time on a global scale a betrayal by the bureaucratic class of the rest of
[01:55:56.260 --> 01:55:59.980]  us on a global scale they're ganging up together the totalitarians
[01:55:59.980 --> 01:56:07.700]  Islam and socialism and environmentalism worldwide getting into bed together to
[01:56:07.700 --> 01:56:13.860]  destroy as many of the world's population as they can now in fact they
[01:56:13.860 --> 01:56:19.820]  needn't try too hard because as countries become more prosperous if they're
[01:56:19.820 --> 01:56:24.020]  allowed to by the environmental freaks trying to interfere with prosperity then
[01:56:24.020 --> 01:56:28.820]  population stabilizes all by itself at the moment we are already at what is
[01:56:28.820 --> 01:56:33.860]  called peak children there will be no more children alive on earth ever
[01:56:33.860 --> 01:56:38.100]  probably than there are today and the only reason why the world's population
[01:56:38.100 --> 01:56:43.460]  will continue to increase over the next 35 years to about 2050 is that people are
[01:56:43.460 --> 01:56:47.260]  going to be living longer because whatever despite what the left is trying
[01:56:47.260 --> 01:56:52.820]  to do to do down the third world by not letting them have economic development
[01:56:52.820 --> 01:56:56.660]  and in particular coal-fired power stations they're going to get them they're
[01:56:56.660 --> 01:57:00.540]  going to get electricity and with it all the benefits of medical care and
[01:57:00.540 --> 01:57:05.580]  decent heating and air conditioning and once that comes in then the populations
[01:57:05.580 --> 01:57:09.300]  in Africa and South America will stop rising and the world population will
[01:57:09.300 --> 01:57:13.820]  stabilize and then even after 2050 or 2060 we could see it beginning to plummet
[01:57:13.820 --> 01:57:19.100]  without any interference from the left and you're quite right Alex I mean people
[01:57:19.100 --> 01:57:23.860]  like Holdren who was one of the advisors to Paul Ehrlich who wrote that
[01:57:23.860 --> 01:57:28.060]  remarkably stupid book the population bomb and has recently written an even
[01:57:28.060 --> 01:57:33.660]  more remarkably stupid book Holdren who causes now advising Obama he has been
[01:57:33.660 --> 01:57:37.100]  wrong as I've just been saying the left are wrong everything he's been wrong on
[01:57:37.100 --> 01:57:43.740]  every alarmist stupid he's not wrong he's a liar well I think whichever whether
[01:57:43.740 --> 01:57:47.740]  he's a liar or not he's certainly wrong he's incorrect he made forecasts that
[01:57:47.740 --> 01:57:52.460]  have not come to pass full of prunes that much I think that much we can
[01:57:52.460 --> 01:57:58.460]  certainly say but yet people on the left still listen to him why because it
[01:57:58.460 --> 01:58:03.700]  provides a fig leaf it provides a pretext it provides an excuse it provides
[01:58:03.700 --> 01:58:08.140]  a pretense which enables them to get sure let's them run the show justifying
[01:58:08.140 --> 01:58:14.540]  the totalitarian agenda of suppressing the West and advancing worldwide and
[01:58:14.540 --> 01:58:19.020]  let's use the word communism because that's really what it is I annoy all the
[01:58:19.020 --> 01:58:22.820]  people who comment when I put my monthly temperature records up there's now been
[01:58:22.820 --> 01:58:27.580]  no global warming for 18 years three months and I put it up on the climate
[01:58:27.580 --> 01:58:31.980]  deeper dot com and also at what's up with that dot com and the leftist comment
[01:58:31.980 --> 01:58:36.020]  has come piling in and so I now call them climate communist because that's what
[01:58:36.020 --> 01:58:39.820]  they are there a bunch of totalitarian stay there back in 70 seconds final

[02:00:23.100 --> 02:00:27.220]  final segment with lord christopher montan the tip of the spear exposing the
[02:00:27.220 --> 02:00:33.060]  climate takeover it's a perfect plan if you can tax and track carbon you can
[02:00:33.060 --> 02:00:37.940]  dominate and run every form of life and you drill into bill gates of statements
[02:00:37.940 --> 02:00:40.740]  and the rest of it it's all about controlling people they know it's a
[02:00:40.740 --> 02:00:45.580]  scam they chose it first it was global cooling in the 70s and then it was
[02:00:45.580 --> 02:00:50.340]  global warming in the 90s and now it's just changed period isn't supposed to
[02:00:50.340 --> 02:00:53.460]  be happening well a lot of real environmental issues overfishing and
[02:00:53.460 --> 02:00:58.460]  other things are ignored we should be trying to industrialize with clean
[02:00:58.460 --> 02:01:02.260]  systems the third world then they'll have negative population growth like the
[02:01:02.260 --> 02:01:07.220]  west that has about 1.5 children on average that's actually a collapse rate
[02:01:07.220 --> 02:01:11.900]  from japan to the united states wealthy countries are committing suicide from
[02:01:11.900 --> 02:01:17.940]  italy to canada we're having an average 1.5 children even lower in japan and as
[02:01:17.940 --> 02:01:23.220]  lord mongton said the numbers are there mathematics does not lie lord mongton we
[02:01:23.220 --> 02:01:26.540]  got four minutes left you've got the floor to hit any other important tid
[02:01:26.540 --> 02:01:30.740]  bits and what you've set your sights on next there's a success story of australia
[02:01:30.740 --> 02:01:34.780]  you just got back from there I'm very pleased about that I was able to show
[02:01:34.780 --> 02:01:38.260]  the graph showing there been no global warming for 18 years and then two months
[02:01:38.260 --> 02:01:43.180]  now 18 years three months according to the RSS satellite record and all the
[02:01:43.180 --> 02:01:47.500]  other temperature records are within the same kind of statistical territory as
[02:01:47.500 --> 02:01:51.740]  that one so we can't really be sure that we've seen any work warming at all
[02:01:51.740 --> 02:01:56.940]  really over the last 20 years or so it simply isn't happening and that is now
[02:01:56.940 --> 02:02:01.260]  gradually becoming better now it's becoming very very difficult for the
[02:02:01.260 --> 02:02:05.700]  left that control the world's media to keep that secret for very much longer
[02:02:05.700 --> 02:02:08.780]  they're trying to but they're not getting away with it it's spreading in
[02:02:08.780 --> 02:02:12.380]  samiz that people are making postcards of my monthly graphs they're sending them
[02:02:12.380 --> 02:02:16.500]  to each other the message is getting out there that this isn't happening the
[02:02:16.500 --> 02:02:20.940]  sea ice extent has been at its greatest recently sea level isn't really rising
[02:02:20.940 --> 02:02:25.380]  hurricanes are down flooding is not really changing its pattern much droughts
[02:02:25.380 --> 02:02:29.420]  are down over the last 30 years all the disasters they said would happen are
[02:02:29.420 --> 02:02:34.420]  showing absolutely no sign of happening at all yes you get occasional extreme
[02:02:34.420 --> 02:02:38.620]  whether you always have you always will get used to it and prepare for it but
[02:02:38.620 --> 02:02:41.460]  don't for heaven's sake think that it's going to get systematically worse
[02:02:41.460 --> 02:02:47.940]  because on the evidence so far it simply isn't and we now have just a few
[02:02:47.940 --> 02:02:54.980]  months to make the world aware that there is no need for any binding climate
[02:02:54.980 --> 02:03:00.420]  treaty in Paris in December of this year they're going to try to do again what
[02:03:00.420 --> 02:03:05.260]  they did it failed to do in Copenhagen they've squared the Chinese by
[02:03:05.260 --> 02:03:09.700]  effectively exempting them from the process but other nations at the moment
[02:03:09.700 --> 02:03:13.220]  are all going to go along with it except Canada and New Zealand Canada might be
[02:03:13.220 --> 02:03:17.340]  having a change of government in a few months time so leaving only Australia
[02:03:17.340 --> 02:03:22.020]  standing out against the climate nonsense and this means a lot rests on
[02:03:22.020 --> 02:03:26.260]  Tony Abbott's shoulders I'm glad to say that at the moment he's still standing as
[02:03:26.260 --> 02:03:29.980]  firm as he can on this he is dismantling the carbon tax and briefly
[02:03:29.980 --> 02:03:33.860]  of the briefly we should add Australia is the only one standing against it
[02:03:33.860 --> 02:03:37.740]  because they implemented it first and found out how hellish it was that's
[02:03:37.740 --> 02:03:41.780]  right it did it did nothing of course for their emissions of CO2 it did nothing
[02:03:41.780 --> 02:03:46.780]  to change the climate either way indeed nothing that mankind does about CO2 will
[02:03:46.780 --> 02:03:50.420]  measurably alter the climate at all according to our research is not going
[02:03:50.420 --> 02:03:56.380]  to make that much difference this whole exercise every red cent spent on making
[02:03:56.380 --> 02:03:59.500]  global warming go away on having these fancy conferences in places where they
[02:03:59.500 --> 02:04:04.700]  have grass skirts these every penny of this has been wasted and will continue
[02:04:04.700 --> 02:04:09.180]  to be wasted until the world comes to its senses Alex we have less than one
[02:04:09.180 --> 02:04:14.740]  year I'm trying to raise one point three million dollars to make a film a full
[02:04:14.740 --> 02:04:19.820]  length feature film to go into the cinemas to take Al Gore's movie on head
[02:04:19.820 --> 02:04:23.460]  to take on the documentaries that you saw being shown in the cinemas about the
[02:04:23.460 --> 02:04:27.620]  island disappearing beneath the waves it's largely nonsense we want one point
[02:04:27.620 --> 02:04:31.620]  three million we're just now beginning the fundraising for that and if we get

[02:08:58.820 --> 02:09:03.980]  actually ran into him and he pulled her over and he found out that she was
[02:09:03.980 --> 02:09:09.700]  racing to see her sixth sign and then so they basically drove her in the police
[02:09:09.700 --> 02:09:13.860]  cars through the different jurisdictions to get her there quicker which is a
[02:09:13.860 --> 02:09:17.100]  good kind of thing to do not freak out and arrest the lady we've been seeing
[02:09:17.100 --> 02:09:20.140]  cops now arresting a guy that's driving his wife to the hospital because she's
[02:09:20.140 --> 02:09:24.460]  pregnant or cops that pull over an EMT that they say speeding well that's what
[02:09:24.460 --> 02:09:31.020]  ambulances do you know we just don't need hothead thugs to battle the thugs we
[02:09:31.020 --> 02:09:35.660]  need peace officers that are honorable and and and are helping people but also
[02:09:35.660 --> 02:09:39.900]  are tough and can deal with criminals that's what real men are like anyways
[02:09:39.900 --> 02:09:45.500]  not just a bunch of fake tough we we need we don't need the fake tough folks we
[02:09:45.500 --> 02:09:51.500]  need the the crazy brave to quote full metal jacket now there's a lot of crazy
[02:09:51.500 --> 02:09:56.060]  stuff going on this morning first we heard that ISIS was going to hack
[02:09:56.060 --> 02:10:02.700]  Pentagon websites and now what's happened this whole thing
[02:10:02.700 --> 02:10:07.740]  wreaks a false flag this week they're going to reintroduce the cyber security
[02:10:07.740 --> 02:10:11.300]  bills that basically expand a whole new branch of government that's already in
[02:10:11.300 --> 02:10:15.180]  place they wanted official and expand in as they spying and try to get sopa and
[02:10:15.180 --> 02:10:18.380]  syspa back in it's all happening and right on time
[02:10:18.380 --> 02:10:21.820]  central command social media accounts apparently hacked by Islamic state
[02:10:21.820 --> 02:10:27.580]  i'm gonna say this again is lomax state is al-qaeda in syria and iraq
[02:10:27.580 --> 02:10:30.380]  that's what it means the area they're carving out of the two countries that
[02:10:30.380 --> 02:10:37.500]  border each other in eastern syria western iraq the west armed them
[02:10:37.500 --> 02:10:41.420]  the west let the terrorists that were in paris fly everywhere they want to know
[02:10:41.420 --> 02:10:49.980]  fly list i'm sick of it how crazy and in their tweet they said
[02:10:49.980 --> 02:10:54.860]  isis is here inside your pc's pentagon
[02:10:54.860 --> 02:10:59.340]  this is the perfect way they probably got an outside corporate group doing this
[02:10:59.340 --> 02:11:02.860]  and they'll they probably got some idiot patsy who's taking part in it and got
[02:11:02.860 --> 02:11:06.460]  recruited who they'll bust and give credit to i mean it's just
[02:11:06.460 --> 02:11:11.260]  so obvious u.s military social media accounts apparently hacked by as
[02:11:11.260 --> 02:11:15.100]  lomax state sympathizers and we'll go back and show you one of those
[02:11:15.100 --> 02:11:18.540]  accounts i want to read what the isis people said let me ask you a little
[02:11:18.540 --> 02:11:22.060]  question why do the isis jackasses have twitter accounts
[02:11:22.060 --> 02:11:25.340]  oh because the pentagon wants to be able to track what they're doing yeah
[02:11:25.340 --> 02:11:30.300]  right isis is already here when your pc's
[02:11:30.300 --> 02:11:34.620]  in each military base and they tweeted a photo
[02:11:34.620 --> 02:11:41.340]  of troops in their base cyber caliphate how much you want to bet that it didn't
[02:11:41.340 --> 02:11:44.460]  actually run by jihadis
[02:11:45.020 --> 02:11:49.420]  and it's a sigh up to the military to believe something's really going on
[02:11:49.420 --> 02:11:53.260]  so they'll get all upset and go over there and be ready to fight them
[02:11:53.260 --> 02:11:57.180]  the problem is the military number two years ago knows that this is al-qaeda
[02:11:57.180 --> 02:12:00.700]  knows it was armed and protected i want to take your calls it's 800
[02:12:00.700 --> 02:12:06.220]  259 92 31 on any issue we've raised today 800

[02:13:08.700 --> 02:13:12.780]  that's the same underwear bomber run and controlled by emerald alaki who's a
[02:13:12.780 --> 02:13:16.540]  known pentagon frontman that's just some of the news
[02:13:16.540 --> 02:13:22.540]  up on info wars dot com and prisonplanet.com
[02:13:22.540 --> 02:13:28.220]  let's before i get back into other news we haven't hit yet
[02:13:28.220 --> 02:13:30.940]  let me hit one more news story then i'll go to john and others that are
[02:13:30.940 --> 02:13:34.380]  currently uh holding uh bloomberg reporting what
[02:13:34.380 --> 02:13:38.300]  again we told you was happening when this started six months ago
[02:13:38.300 --> 02:13:41.580]  opaque is a cartel but they put out a press release saying they're not a
[02:13:41.580 --> 02:13:45.660]  cartel and that they're not fixing prices
[02:13:45.660 --> 02:13:50.300]  that's like saying that job of the hut isn't fat
[02:13:50.300 --> 02:13:55.420]  well now bloomberg is reporting uh just to show you again that this is what's
[02:13:55.420 --> 02:13:59.580]  going on they now admit it how opaque weaponized the price of oil against
[02:13:59.580 --> 02:14:06.540]  us drillers that's always been the plan but working with the west
[02:14:06.540 --> 02:14:10.780]  it was meant to take down russia and also us companies that are smaller
[02:14:10.780 --> 02:14:14.860]  that got in debt to expand a drilling boom
[02:14:14.860 --> 02:14:18.700]  obama two months ago stopped issuing their permits
[02:14:18.700 --> 02:14:22.860]  so notice you have obama coordinating with opec to not give permits
[02:14:22.860 --> 02:14:26.940]  that alone began a slide in investment and got investors out of it
[02:14:26.940 --> 02:14:30.540]  and now people are in debt so the investment money is running out of it
[02:14:30.540 --> 02:14:34.540]  because it was small independent operations and now market watch reports
[02:14:34.540 --> 02:14:37.900]  the saudi's have come out and said above a hundred never again
[02:14:37.900 --> 02:14:43.980]  says saudi prince al-awid so uh that's the game plan ladies and
[02:14:43.980 --> 02:14:47.100]  gentlemen and they're bringing down all prices
[02:14:47.100 --> 02:14:52.780]  also to hide inflation in qe unlimited so this is a very sophisticated
[02:14:52.780 --> 02:14:57.180]  operation being carried out and the saudi's are only part of it
[02:14:57.180 --> 02:15:01.660]  but local drillers in texas and other areas in canada are upset
[02:15:01.660 --> 02:15:06.540]  so they realize the saudi's are funding anti fracking movies you name it
[02:15:06.540 --> 02:15:10.140]  and i'm not saying fracking's done well in a lot of areas and is perfect
[02:15:10.140 --> 02:15:13.180]  the point is they're just going to frack somewhere else
[02:15:13.180 --> 02:15:17.900]  and this is meant to get rid of u.s producers and most fracking is done
[02:15:17.900 --> 02:15:21.660]  i mean that just means they're rehabilitating wells in most cases
[02:15:21.660 --> 02:15:25.340]  but how opec weaponized the price of oil against us drillers and against
[02:15:25.340 --> 02:15:27.900]  russia and that's why this was done and is
[02:15:27.900 --> 02:15:31.420]  concerned so we're giving you the rest of the story
[02:15:31.420 --> 02:15:34.860]  but but months later now bloomberg says it's see
[02:15:34.860 --> 02:15:42.940]  because it can't be hidden anymore john in texas you're on the air welcome
[02:15:42.940 --> 02:15:46.140]  howdy thank you for having me on you bet
[02:15:46.140 --> 02:15:49.820]  um i wanted to make a comment on on uh
[02:15:49.820 --> 02:15:53.420]  both of the two comments one was on on the thing you were talking with lord
[02:15:53.420 --> 02:15:57.180]  moffin earlier i think he's that is one of the most intelligent
[02:15:57.180 --> 02:16:02.460]  men alive and it's excellent that you have them on
[02:16:02.460 --> 02:16:06.380]  there and i really try to get as many people that can't listen
[02:16:06.380 --> 02:16:10.380]  especially when he's on because it's really
[02:16:10.380 --> 02:16:14.700]  very aisle for a lot of people well the u.n and all these big banks golden sacks
[02:16:14.700 --> 02:16:18.540]  is the main funder of carbon taxes they have the consortiums that get the
[02:16:18.540 --> 02:16:23.420]  money that pig al gore gets money judge he went for
[02:16:23.420 --> 02:16:26.300]  being worth 200 million dollars just five years ago
[02:16:26.300 --> 02:16:29.580]  as carbon taxes kicked in in limited areas around the world
[02:16:29.580 --> 02:16:33.980]  to over a billion he's going to be worth hundreds of billions
[02:16:33.980 --> 02:16:37.980]  i mean if you go to california now and gas your car you are paying
[02:16:37.980 --> 02:16:42.460]  a tax to pig monster man bear pig i'm sorry go ahead
[02:16:42.460 --> 02:16:45.500]  oh that's okay the other thing i wanted to comment on is
[02:16:45.500 --> 02:16:50.700]  is that a couple of days ago you had uh put on info wars a piece about albert
[02:16:50.700 --> 02:16:54.540]  pike and i wanted to comment on that because i'm a blue
[02:16:54.540 --> 02:16:58.940]  lodge freemason myself personally here in texas and
[02:16:58.940 --> 02:17:02.860]  i absolutely refuse to become a scottish right
[02:17:02.860 --> 02:17:09.260]  member because that piece was fairly accurate and i'm not going to lie about
[02:17:09.260 --> 02:17:12.860]  that at all i mean you guys hit a lot of
[02:17:12.860 --> 02:17:16.380]  really good accurate point there's a lot more there
[02:17:16.380 --> 02:17:20.860]  but by the way john bound he said he wanted to do a piece on it last friday
[02:17:20.860 --> 02:17:24.620]  he had three hours till quitting time and i said just go hammer it
[02:17:24.620 --> 02:17:27.900]  fast john he did a great job he should do a follow-up
[02:17:27.900 --> 02:17:31.500]  to that as well but yeah for folks that don't know about albert pike
[02:17:31.500 --> 02:17:35.100]  and a lot of the masonic calls his picture hangs in there and again the
[02:17:35.100 --> 02:17:37.900]  masons are diverse people that say they're behind all the bad are just
[02:17:37.900 --> 02:17:40.860]  ignorant george washington was a mason he warned about the
[02:17:40.860 --> 02:17:44.780]  illuminati trying to take it over it's a very diverse group but as a mason what's
[02:17:44.780 --> 02:17:48.060]  your issue with albert pike and what do you want to elaborate on because he did
[02:17:48.060 --> 02:17:52.620]  talk about three world wars how the real god of masonry was lucifer
[02:17:52.620 --> 02:17:57.020]  when clearly it's not the god that king david the solemn were worshiping is the
[02:17:57.020 --> 02:18:00.700]  opposite of lucifer so it's an attempted satanic
[02:18:00.700 --> 02:18:08.380]  takeover of masonry from my you know outside research give us your take
[02:18:08.380 --> 02:18:13.260]  personal research but i researched masonry for about four years before i ever
[02:18:13.260 --> 02:18:17.900]  decided to become one the only reason i researched it is because it kept coming
[02:18:17.900 --> 02:18:21.340]  up when it came to the founding fathers of texas
[02:18:21.340 --> 02:18:25.180]  and most of the founding fathers of texas were masons and they were blue locks
[02:18:25.180 --> 02:18:28.220]  mason they were very specifically you know we
[02:18:28.220 --> 02:18:33.580]  worship the god of israel uh that's it god is the god of israel
[02:18:33.580 --> 02:18:38.460]  and like you said it's the god of king solemn and i personally i'm a christian
[02:18:38.460 --> 02:18:44.860]  i've worshiped Jesus christ uh but all the research i kept finding kept
[02:18:44.860 --> 02:18:49.340]  leading to the point the conclusion was that that
[02:18:49.340 --> 02:18:53.980]  the the albert pike version of scottish right from masonry came from the
[02:18:53.980 --> 02:18:59.740]  aluminist in france and that's what he carried on
[02:18:59.740 --> 02:19:04.220]  and albert pike became the head of the illuminati
[02:19:04.220 --> 02:19:07.340]  yeah basically basically the modern version of that sure
[02:19:07.340 --> 02:19:11.020]  and so you you'll notice i mean if you do some more research you'll notice that
[02:19:11.020 --> 02:19:14.620]  the scottish right in the northern part of the united states
[02:19:14.620 --> 02:19:18.540]  really doesn't promote him at all they just don't
[02:19:18.540 --> 02:19:21.580]  they really really well he was really i mean he's promoted big in the south the
[02:19:21.580 --> 02:19:24.860]  south got manipulated it's so sad the northing asian great tyranny as well
[02:19:24.860 --> 02:19:29.420]  but british intelligence on record manipulated the south and the north
[02:19:29.420 --> 02:19:32.220]  was doing bad stuff at the south with taxes and things
[02:19:32.220 --> 02:19:35.980]  uh nothing to do with slavery uh manipulated them into that war it was
[02:19:35.980 --> 02:19:39.260]  only meant to break up the u.s and pike was a british agent
[02:19:39.260 --> 02:19:42.700]  and i'm not even bashing the british when i say you know that branch and then
[02:19:42.700 --> 02:19:47.020]  out of france and and that's just in the history uh and uh it's it's pretty
[02:19:47.020 --> 02:19:51.100]  shocking to know that especially on the south he's the head
[02:19:51.100 --> 02:19:53.980]  honcho he is the founder of the cooklox clan
[02:19:53.980 --> 02:19:58.060]  we should also add that as well and super evil just look at his photograph
[02:19:58.060 --> 02:20:03.180]  who we all have our own idea about what being safe and secure means

[02:24:28.060 --> 02:24:33.340]  hey alex in 2010 it was discovered at ball aerospace
[02:24:33.340 --> 02:24:37.660]  that the country of iran had stolen all data information contracting
[02:24:37.660 --> 02:24:41.100]  information um they've been working on for the existence of
[02:24:41.100 --> 02:24:44.940]  their um i guess cooperation that they've been involved
[02:24:44.940 --> 02:24:48.380]  so the reason i'm disclosing this to you is it frustrates me that the united
[02:24:48.380 --> 02:24:51.180]  states of america is now considering working with iran
[02:24:51.180 --> 02:24:54.780]  in the middle east i want to be clear you sound like a credible guy but i don't
[02:24:54.780 --> 02:24:58.780]  know what ball aerospace is this is the kind of thing you should send us an
[02:24:58.780 --> 02:25:02.540]  email or some proof on and then you might be a guest on the show because i
[02:25:02.540 --> 02:25:05.660]  don't i mean if you say you're disclosing this on
[02:25:05.660 --> 02:25:09.500]  air we don't really screen phone calls uh specifically
[02:25:09.500 --> 02:25:13.660]  i know there's all sorts of espionage going on all over the place but uh
[02:25:13.660 --> 02:25:17.180]  i mean the u.s is so infiltrated seven ways to sunday from every group you can
[02:25:17.180 --> 02:25:20.300]  imagine i mean what are you getting it
[02:25:20.300 --> 02:25:26.300]  he just dropped off look into ball aerospace the iranians he presenting to
[02:25:26.300 --> 02:25:29.740]  that uh let's go ahead and talk to chris
[02:25:29.740 --> 02:25:33.260]  in new york i'm not chastising you caller i just you know
[02:25:33.260 --> 02:25:38.460]  chris in new york go ahead all right thank you alex um the reason why i'm
[02:25:38.460 --> 02:25:42.700]  calling is because i was listening to your show yesterday and somebody mentioned
[02:25:42.700 --> 02:25:46.940]  that somebody that had to do with the twa
[02:25:46.940 --> 02:25:51.260]  a hundred flights uh on that case was appointed
[02:25:51.260 --> 02:25:57.580]  to the mta in new york yes and i want to stress that since the open border
[02:25:57.580 --> 02:26:02.140]  policy and the fact that al qaeda was created by the cia and
[02:26:02.140 --> 02:26:07.100]  brazilian uh that they could have some sleeper cells
[02:26:07.100 --> 02:26:11.500]  do something with the subway system blame it then
[02:26:11.500 --> 02:26:16.700]  on al qaeda cells in syria to create the excuse to go into syria and
[02:26:16.700 --> 02:26:20.780]  at the same time they might cash in the um
[02:26:20.780 --> 02:26:26.300]  the terrorism um insurance policies that's right and i wish i was succinct
[02:26:26.300 --> 02:26:29.740]  as you criminal elements of the west give al qaeda tens of
[02:26:29.740 --> 02:26:34.140]  millions of dollars let them take over areas of iraq and syria
[02:26:34.140 --> 02:26:38.460]  then let them start attacking us and then when they have an excuse to go in and
[02:26:38.460 --> 02:26:41.900]  take over syria and actually obama has said we need to
[02:26:41.900 --> 02:26:45.420]  take out a sod because it's given isis a base
[02:26:45.420 --> 02:26:47.980]  that'd be like if i went and burned your house down
[02:26:47.980 --> 02:26:51.260]  and then told the cops you should be arrested for arson because i burned your
[02:26:51.260 --> 02:26:55.020]  house down i mean they prey on our political
[02:26:55.020 --> 02:26:58.780]  ignorance to get away with this and that's why i'm so frustrated when they
[02:26:58.780 --> 02:27:02.860]  call me a conspiracy terrorist this is not a conspiracy theory this is a
[02:27:02.860 --> 02:27:08.380]  conspiracy fact this is going on go ahead
[02:27:08.380 --> 02:27:12.780]  yeah now that you mentioned isis uh i saw a video a long time ago
[02:27:12.780 --> 02:27:17.260]  well not a long time ago the video was old it was about this guy
[02:27:17.260 --> 02:27:21.100]  talking about uh the Mossad with some agent
[02:27:21.100 --> 02:27:24.700]  that i don't remember the name and he asked if there's another name that they
[02:27:24.700 --> 02:27:28.380]  used for the Mossad and that person said to him
[02:27:28.380 --> 02:27:33.660]  is israeli it's the gents service if you put the acronym of that it's actually
[02:27:33.660 --> 02:27:38.300]  isis amazing well israel and everybody knows
[02:27:38.300 --> 02:27:42.220]  that i'm not somebody that hates israel it's just a fact israel along with
[02:27:42.220 --> 02:27:44.860]  turkey the united states france germany england you name it they're all
[02:27:44.860 --> 02:27:48.060]  involved they're in the go on heights across from syria has been giving
[02:27:48.060 --> 02:27:52.060]  medevac aid to the quote syrian free army and the photos have been in the
[02:27:52.060 --> 02:27:56.540]  israeli news the guys with the big beards and the jihadi flags of al-qaeda
[02:27:56.540 --> 02:28:00.220]  and israel and saudi arabia are allies saudi arabia's quarterback in this whole
[02:28:00.220 --> 02:28:04.700]  deal that they're the biggest culprit and uh it's going on and then net yahu
[02:28:04.700 --> 02:28:09.900]  marches against this when he's helped turn loose these people
[02:28:09.900 --> 02:28:13.660]  and kill over 300 000 syrians a syrians is worth
[02:28:13.660 --> 02:28:17.020]  just as much as a frenchman just as much as a jew
[02:28:17.020 --> 02:28:21.500]  just as much as a chinese person a mexican anybody
[02:28:21.500 --> 02:28:25.660]  and i i mean i mean i've seen the photos and video of them killing little
[02:28:25.660 --> 02:28:29.020]  kids and women and blowing up churches and
[02:28:29.020 --> 02:28:32.460]  so evil what what what our governments have done to syria folks they weren't
[02:28:32.460 --> 02:28:37.820]  doing anything they've had four plus years of al-qaeda running up i mean you
[02:28:37.820 --> 02:28:41.340]  think 20 dead's a big deal how about 300 plus thousand
[02:28:41.340 --> 02:28:43.820]  how about al-qaeda shows up and makes your dad
[02:28:43.820 --> 02:28:48.700]  suicide bomb an army checkpoint or he'll kill your family
[02:28:48.700 --> 02:28:52.860]  there'll be no marches for the syrians only our military
[02:28:52.860 --> 02:28:56.940]  has protested online saying they won't be part of this
[02:28:56.940 --> 02:29:02.460]  only our military that's it and they got no media attention except info wars
[02:29:02.460 --> 02:29:06.060]  dot com by many other signs that info wars dot com
[02:29:06.060 --> 02:29:09.660]  so it's a bold move by the establishment chris try to get away with
[02:29:09.660 --> 02:29:13.180]  this what do you think well i think there's a
[02:29:13.180 --> 02:29:16.860]  definitely a bold move but knowing their mo
[02:29:16.860 --> 02:29:20.300]  it's it really fits the you know the profile
[02:29:20.300 --> 02:29:24.460]  what i'm concerned is that once they do this there's gonna be
[02:29:24.460 --> 02:29:28.700]  a police state on steroids there's gonna be no korean steroids
[02:29:28.700 --> 02:29:32.780]  that's it 9-11 helps set up the police state now the asymmetrical attacks all
[02:29:32.780 --> 02:29:35.980]  over the west shopping malls you name it public schools
[02:29:35.980 --> 02:29:39.020]  colleges will be used to roll it out this is it
[02:29:39.020 --> 02:29:42.940]  and we better accept cyber command and internet censorship and free speech
[02:29:42.940 --> 02:29:46.620]  censorship and sopa and syspa all because al-qaeda
[02:29:46.620 --> 02:29:52.060]  attacked the south syria we're on the march the empires on the run and who
[02:29:52.060 --> 02:29:57.100]  gave a new base and the gcn radio network

[02:33:13.580 --> 02:33:21.100]  it's alex jones you know a few years ago we had a new york trooper on stan
[02:33:21.100 --> 02:33:24.940]  linick who defended people's rights outside of the checkpoint
[02:33:24.940 --> 02:33:28.860]  to warn people about the dangers of the naked body scanners
[02:33:28.860 --> 02:33:32.620]  and the airport ended up the state police ended up backing him
[02:33:32.620 --> 02:33:36.300]  and that video got a couple million views made national news
[02:33:36.300 --> 02:33:41.020]  and i've told my crew because i see out there in the public police officers
[02:33:41.020 --> 02:33:46.220]  being professional being helpful uh really doing a tough job
[02:33:46.220 --> 02:33:50.700]  nine times out of 10 in most departments sure there's a lot of thugs that end up
[02:33:50.700 --> 02:33:54.060]  getting hired uh there's some departments that become bad
[02:33:54.060 --> 02:33:57.340]  some of the unions defend bad officers but more and more
[02:33:57.340 --> 02:34:01.500]  that's getting uh cleaned up and reversed as the american people
[02:34:01.500 --> 02:34:05.500]  and these police departments wake up to what's happening in the age of youtube
[02:34:05.500 --> 02:34:08.780]  it can create the perception that the police are just a bunch of out of
[02:34:08.780 --> 02:34:14.780]  control demons uh running around uh attacking everybody's freedoms
[02:34:14.780 --> 02:34:18.460]  and if we just get into an us against them mentality and and
[02:34:18.460 --> 02:34:21.820]  turn the police into the enemy that will play into
[02:34:21.820 --> 02:34:26.460]  social engineers hands in different areas of federal government
[02:34:26.460 --> 02:34:31.660]  to then create an us against them mentality the way to reform america
[02:34:31.660 --> 02:34:35.660]  the way to promote a bill of rights culture of mutual respect
[02:34:35.660 --> 02:34:39.580]  is to reach out to the police and the police to reach out to the people
[02:34:39.580 --> 02:34:44.700]  and to back cops that are good cops and then to stand up when police are
[02:34:44.700 --> 02:34:47.980]  clearly out of control and usually it's one or two guys out of a bunch of
[02:34:47.980 --> 02:34:50.780]  people and they'll have a bunch of stuff in their record
[02:34:50.780 --> 02:34:55.260]  and you know who the bad apples are now that's separate from the police state
[02:34:55.260 --> 02:35:00.140]  itself that is globally being set up by corporations being
[02:35:00.140 --> 02:35:04.540]  pushed with grants to turn the police into unaccountable robots
[02:35:04.540 --> 02:35:08.860]  that are surveilled by gps themselves that aren't allowed to make their own
[02:35:08.860 --> 02:35:13.980]  decisions that basically become robots so the police are the group being
[02:35:13.980 --> 02:35:16.300]  scapegoated so often as we've seen by the
[02:35:16.300 --> 02:35:21.740]  justice department and others lately as what's wrong with government
[02:35:21.740 --> 02:35:25.260]  when what's wrong with government is a lot of foreign special interests
[02:35:25.260 --> 02:35:29.260]  have seized control of things and we have a crony capitalist system that picks
[02:35:29.260 --> 02:35:32.060]  winners and losers not a true capitalist system
[02:35:32.060 --> 02:35:34.940]  we need to worry about Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan and
[02:35:34.940 --> 02:35:41.100]  out of control federal agencies and the UN not with police
[02:35:41.660 --> 02:35:46.300]  we need to try to save the country from strife and civil war
[02:35:46.300 --> 02:35:49.020]  not expand it we're going to go to our guests here for just a few minutes i
[02:35:49.020 --> 02:35:51.980]  appreciate his time the stories up on info wars.com
[02:35:51.980 --> 02:35:55.340]  adan salazar i wrote a story about it it was picked up by
[02:35:55.340 --> 02:35:59.100]  kutv news we've got a short clip of that cops
[02:35:59.100 --> 02:36:04.220]  escort 84 year old woman to see six son after crash with patrol car
[02:36:04.220 --> 02:36:07.100]  she was speeding he pulled her over wrote her a warning
[02:36:07.100 --> 02:36:10.460]  she backed into him 84 clearly freaked out
[02:36:10.460 --> 02:36:14.300]  he gave her a ride got her car towed the police department paid for it
[02:36:14.300 --> 02:36:17.900]  and then they relayed her through the different jurisdictions
[02:36:17.900 --> 02:36:23.420]  of the state police to see her son and it's a human act like i see cops changing
[02:36:23.420 --> 02:36:28.940]  tires or helping people that is what is fulfilling in life
[02:36:28.940 --> 02:36:32.940]  that's the type of police officer we need but as a culture people think service
[02:36:32.940 --> 02:36:35.980]  is bad you open a door for women they think it's weird
[02:36:35.980 --> 02:36:40.380]  you say thank you to somebody i think it's weird we it's not the police that
[02:36:40.380 --> 02:36:43.580]  are degenerating so much as it's the public that's degenerating
[02:36:43.580 --> 02:36:48.540]  and then you're going to have the police reflect that we need to really address
[02:36:48.540 --> 02:36:52.860]  the root problem not scapegoat the police so that's why i wanted to
[02:36:52.860 --> 02:36:57.020]  more and more give you good examples of good things the police are doing
[02:36:57.020 --> 02:37:00.940]  to hold that up so that other police will then emulate that
[02:37:00.940 --> 02:37:05.260]  instead of emulating the bullies let's go to this clip from wkutv
[02:37:05.260 --> 02:37:09.100]  i was headed to salt lake because i had a
[02:37:09.100 --> 02:37:12.700]  son that wasn't going to make it 87 year old
[02:37:12.700 --> 02:37:17.260]  helen skeeter smith lives in southern nevada they called me about bar
[02:37:17.260 --> 02:37:21.900]  randy and then helen here with a friend learned her son randy in utah
[02:37:21.900 --> 02:37:27.980]  was in the hospital critically ill she got in the car hit i-15 and started
[02:37:27.980 --> 02:37:30.940]  driving north making it as far as central utah
[02:37:30.940 --> 02:37:35.420]  where she was pulled over by trooper jeff jones but he was it was all nice
[02:37:35.420 --> 02:37:39.740]  oh yeah he was doing a job helen was given a warning for a traffic violation
[02:37:39.740 --> 02:37:44.460]  here so i must pass him but then instead of pulling forward to leave
[02:37:44.460 --> 02:37:48.540]  she put her car in reverse and struck the troopers patrol car
[02:37:48.540 --> 02:37:52.380]  and i put a little dent in his car and he realized
[02:37:52.380 --> 02:37:57.340]  it was not safe for her to drive so trooper jones had helen's car towed
[02:37:57.340 --> 02:38:00.460]  and he gave her a ride from philmore to jewab county
[02:38:00.460 --> 02:38:05.100]  where he handed her off to trooper jara jensen who drove her to utah county
[02:38:05.100 --> 02:38:09.820]  who handed helen off to trooper christ bishop who drove her to salt lake county
[02:38:09.820 --> 02:38:15.820]  and to trooper andrew pollard she was very excited to tell me about her uh
[02:38:15.820 --> 02:38:20.300]  dogs or cats or her hometown and he took her
[02:38:20.300 --> 02:38:24.300]  all the way to ogden regional medical center i ended up taking
[02:38:24.300 --> 02:38:28.620]  four patrol cars four good-looking patrol boys
[02:38:28.620 --> 02:38:34.060]  brought me when this happened helen likely never realized her crash would
[02:38:34.060 --> 02:38:38.860]  touch off a chain reaction of kindness to have them there waiting to hold her
[02:38:38.860 --> 02:38:43.980]  hand as we walked into the hospital uh it was it was very very rewarding it
[02:38:43.980 --> 02:38:49.100]  may have been one of the best accidents real
[02:38:49.100 --> 02:38:51.740]  i'm grateful
[02:38:52.620 --> 02:38:58.700]  now it was trooper jones that did the old-fashioned peace officer thing we saw
[02:38:58.700 --> 02:39:02.300]  the footage of you know in texas the guy talks back the old
[02:39:02.300 --> 02:39:06.540]  man so the cop taser zeeman starts beating him up
[02:39:06.540 --> 02:39:11.180]  but again the media doesn't tend to focus in on the positive stories
[02:39:11.180 --> 02:39:15.340]  that are going on and of course he joins us he has a b and international
[02:39:15.340 --> 02:39:18.140]  politics and a minor in eastern studies and military
[02:39:18.140 --> 02:39:23.740]  science he's been with the uh state police there in utah since 2003 and he
[02:39:23.740 --> 02:39:26.700]  joins us just to talk about this i mean i'm sure he does stuff like this all
[02:39:26.700 --> 02:39:29.180]  the time this ended up getting picked up by the media
[02:39:29.180 --> 02:39:32.700]  and we just thought it's important to focus in on some positive uh things
[02:39:32.700 --> 02:39:36.860]  trooper jones thanks for coming on with us thank you for having me well i know
[02:39:36.860 --> 02:39:39.500]  you don't have a lot of time but just spend a few minutes talking about this
[02:39:39.500 --> 02:39:43.580]  case and all the attention it got
[02:39:43.580 --> 02:39:46.300]  well i i actually didn't expect the attention
[02:39:46.300 --> 02:39:50.140]  i uh like you said this is something that a lot of police officers do
[02:39:50.140 --> 02:39:55.100]  we do a lot of things by lunches shuttle people if they need to
[02:39:55.100 --> 02:39:59.740]  um this case in particular i have a grandmother who's similar in age and
[02:39:59.740 --> 02:40:02.620]  it really touched the court that she needed to get somewhere and i didn't
[02:40:02.620 --> 02:40:06.300]  feel like she was going to make a difference with by herself
[02:40:06.300 --> 02:40:09.580]  so contacted her family got a hold of her family and
[02:40:09.580 --> 02:40:12.620]  they say that they were already in the hospital she kept telling me she needed
[02:40:12.620 --> 02:40:16.860]  to go to ogden which was actually north of where her son was
[02:40:16.860 --> 02:40:20.860]  and i kept asking her well why do we need to go to ogden if you need to go to
[02:40:20.860 --> 02:40:23.820]  salt lake that thing that was in ogden regional
[02:40:23.820 --> 02:40:27.820]  he was actually in salt lake so i contacted her family again
[02:40:27.820 --> 02:40:32.620]  found out where we could meet up and contacted dispatch
[02:40:32.620 --> 02:40:35.980]  they made contact with other troopers and with their supervisors and
[02:40:35.980 --> 02:40:40.940]  we got the team going well it's good to see cases like this you
[02:40:40.940 --> 02:40:43.820]  don't get attention where police officers help homeless people and things
[02:40:43.820 --> 02:40:46.140]  like that but like you said i think this is
[02:40:46.140 --> 02:40:49.740]  something that the police have always basically been doing it just doesn't get
[02:40:49.740 --> 02:40:53.580]  attention what is your i mean overall view why do you
[02:40:53.580 --> 02:40:57.740]  think people responded so positively to this
[02:40:57.740 --> 02:41:01.660]  i think people are just they're looking for some good they want to see some
[02:41:01.660 --> 02:41:05.020]  positive things on the news not just things that
[02:41:05.020 --> 02:41:09.820]  depress you or upset you and this was one of those stories where
[02:41:09.820 --> 02:41:14.460]  it turned out well well like you said if this is the type of stuff police do all
[02:41:14.460 --> 02:41:17.100]  the time it just doesn't get attention give me some other examples of what
[02:41:17.100 --> 02:41:20.380]  you've done or what other people in your department have done that uh doesn't get
[02:41:20.380 --> 02:41:23.420]  attention well one example i worked with a
[02:41:23.420 --> 02:41:25.980]  guy he uh came across a teenage girl one night
[02:41:25.980 --> 02:41:29.020]  who'd run out of gas didn't have any money with her
[02:41:29.020 --> 02:41:33.340]  he called her mother and paid for the gas so she could get home
[02:41:33.340 --> 02:41:36.620]  um i myself have taken families out to
[02:41:36.620 --> 02:41:40.060]  lunch before if i didn't think they'd had any food and it was going to be a
[02:41:40.060 --> 02:41:43.980]  while before they got there they're going to have help coming
[02:41:43.980 --> 02:41:47.100]  this is something that happens all the time but i don't think any of it's
[02:41:47.100 --> 02:41:50.860]  really documented we don't go out there to do it just to say hey we're here
[02:41:50.860 --> 02:41:55.180]  doing this we do it because it's the right thing to do
[02:41:55.180 --> 02:41:58.460]  well i think that's what separates a first world country from a third world
[02:41:58.460 --> 02:42:01.900]  country where i think we can pretty much agree a lot of the police in Mexico or
[02:42:01.900 --> 02:42:05.980]  say north korea are corrupt versus more of a free society
[02:42:05.980 --> 02:42:11.420]  uh and uh i think what plays into that is if we get just flat out mistrust the
[02:42:11.420 --> 02:42:15.180]  police that it seems like some of the establishment media want
[02:42:15.180 --> 02:42:19.180]  then society will start to break down and then that won't attract
[02:42:19.180 --> 02:42:24.060]  good people to serve as peace officers
[02:42:24.060 --> 02:42:28.060]  well i gotta say it's it's different it changes all the time
[02:42:28.060 --> 02:42:31.740]  um we have ups and downs and and things happen and things get covered and
[02:42:31.740 --> 02:42:35.420]  spun a certain way but in this case i think it got spun
[02:42:35.420 --> 02:42:38.300]  true the way that it really happened and the
[02:42:38.300 --> 02:42:42.060]  reasons we did it were to help her get to see her son
[02:42:42.060 --> 02:42:45.260]  and to help her family not to have the stress of having to worry about how to
[02:42:45.260 --> 02:42:49.660]  get her well watching that squad car video you
[02:42:49.660 --> 02:42:52.700]  can see she can hardly walk on her cane you're having to help her
[02:42:52.700 --> 02:42:55.900]  and she looked pretty shook up i don't think she drives more than to the market
[02:42:55.900 --> 02:42:59.180]  maybe once a week kind of like my grandmother who's 89 who had to quit
[02:42:59.180 --> 02:43:03.180]  driving uh last year now because she can't even do that
[02:43:03.180 --> 02:43:06.460]  but uh you know i've seen the cases where kind of the
[02:43:06.460 --> 02:43:09.500]  especially some of the big city departments where they would probably
[02:43:09.500 --> 02:43:12.780]  have just taken her to jail because she backed into the car and said
[02:43:12.780 --> 02:43:15.820]  you're recklessly driving uh which wouldn't have helped her would have
[02:43:15.820 --> 02:43:20.620]  made the everybody feel bad later and would have been a case in the news
[02:43:20.620 --> 02:43:24.620]  making the police look pretty bad and again it's those rare cases that do that
[02:43:24.620 --> 02:43:27.180]  it's just that the media focuses in on them and i don't blame the media
[02:43:27.180 --> 02:43:30.140]  focusing in it's just i think it's important to also focus in on the
[02:43:30.140 --> 02:43:32.940]  positive stories i don't want to get you any trouble
[02:43:32.940 --> 02:43:35.500]  but in fact i imagine you can't speak to you're speaking to this case we
[02:43:35.500 --> 02:43:38.300]  appreciate you coming on but we've seen this recent
[02:43:38.300 --> 02:43:42.460]  you know just blame the police for some of these tragic cases of deaths
[02:43:42.460 --> 02:43:45.660]  that i don't think are questionable in the case of missouri but some of the
[02:43:45.660 --> 02:43:49.260]  others are questionable and then there's just this blanket projection
[02:43:49.260 --> 02:43:54.460]  that the police period are to blame and that then cops get run over shot and
[02:43:54.460 --> 02:44:00.300]  there's people cheering it uh that is really scary for this society
[02:44:00.300 --> 02:44:06.460]  well it is scary but uh you know in this case we were able to do the
[02:44:06.460 --> 02:44:09.660]  right thing we got her where she needed to go
[02:44:09.660 --> 02:44:13.020]  we were able to include a whole bunch of people in the
[02:44:13.020 --> 02:44:16.700]  in the chain of command as far as able to contact supervisors and they thought
[02:44:16.700 --> 02:44:19.820]  it was the right thing to do and they were able to allocate assets to get it
[02:44:19.820 --> 02:44:24.460]  done um we're here to help we're not here to hurt
[02:44:24.460 --> 02:44:27.580]  well i'm glad you guys are out there doing that and we really appreciate
[02:44:27.580 --> 02:44:31.420]  you and enjoy that beautiful scenery uh there in utah thank you so much tripper
[02:44:31.420 --> 02:44:35.900]  johnson thank you god bless you and again it's just a simple case like you
[02:44:35.900 --> 02:44:39.100]  said it's not that big of a deal they do that all the time it's that that
[02:44:39.100 --> 02:44:45.020]  behavior needs to be rewarded not the other behavior and i've
[02:44:45.020 --> 02:44:48.940]  studied sociology now and psychology a lot more than i did 20 years ago when i
[02:44:48.940 --> 02:44:52.620]  was first on air and i saw the militarization of police and
[02:44:52.620 --> 02:44:55.260]  unconstitutional things and i got mad at the police
[02:44:55.260 --> 02:44:58.620]  and we just yell at them basically and then i began to realize over the years
[02:44:58.620 --> 02:45:01.740]  that's not effective
[02:45:02.380 --> 02:45:05.900]  that's what the globalists want especially when i read
[02:45:05.900 --> 02:45:09.500]  different white papers psychology papers we've shown on air where the system
[02:45:09.500 --> 02:45:12.540]  admitted that we're going to militarize police we're going to have zero
[02:45:12.540 --> 02:45:16.060]  tolerance we're going to make them paramilitary the public's not going to
[02:45:16.060 --> 02:45:20.300]  like it and this is going to divide them from the people
[02:45:20.300 --> 02:45:24.540]  more divide and conquer so i want to criticize policies and
[02:45:24.540 --> 02:45:28.220]  that departments have that are bad i want to go after cops that are bad
[02:45:28.220 --> 02:45:31.660]  but i want to go after judges that are bad i want to go after politicians that
[02:45:31.660 --> 02:45:34.060]  are bad corporate people that are bad i want to go after
[02:45:34.060 --> 02:45:39.580]  citizens that are bad my dad got mugged
[02:45:39.580 --> 02:45:42.620]  well they tried to mug him once and mugged him another time because growing
[02:45:42.620 --> 02:45:47.260]  up if he if he wasn't super late it would
[02:45:47.260 --> 02:45:50.220]  got to the point where we would all groan my sister and i my mother he would
[02:45:50.220 --> 02:45:53.980]  pull over and change tires
[02:45:53.980 --> 02:45:57.660]  he didn't do it because he was doubly do right he wanted to be helped if something
[02:45:57.660 --> 02:46:01.820]  was wrong with him it was he just came from the country that's what she did
[02:46:01.820 --> 02:46:04.700]  and he would just i mean he'd be driving back from business trip at
[02:46:04.700 --> 02:46:08.860]  one in the morning in dallas and pull over to help people
[02:46:08.860 --> 02:46:13.580]  and then they'd pull a gun on him and take his wallet
[02:46:13.580 --> 02:46:18.620]  stuff like that um and you've got to ask yourself what happened to us as a
[02:46:18.620 --> 02:46:21.580]  society
[02:46:21.580 --> 02:46:26.860]  that we went from the general you could get you could pick up a hitchhiker
[02:46:26.860 --> 02:46:30.700]  and not get killed you could pull over and try to help somebody
[02:46:30.700 --> 02:46:33.020]  people are scared to get help from you now because they're afraid of somebody
[02:46:33.020 --> 02:46:37.340]  pulls over how did we change this culture
[02:46:37.340 --> 02:46:41.020]  and i think the answer is that we lost we lost god
[02:46:41.020 --> 02:46:44.140]  and the churches don't promote god i mean they promote a plastic god a
[02:46:44.140 --> 02:46:46.940]  synthetic god
[02:46:48.380 --> 02:46:53.100]  you know my dad does not really pull over and help people anymore
[02:46:53.100 --> 02:46:56.620]  i guess getting robbed twice kind of changed him on that like the last time
[02:46:56.620 --> 02:46:59.740]  was like 20 years ago
[02:46:59.740 --> 02:47:03.180]  he was back visiting dallas doing some consulting
[02:47:03.180 --> 02:47:08.620]  and got robbed pulling over helping people day or night
[02:47:08.620 --> 02:47:11.340]  and the famous thing they do in parking lots where a guy is that like he's
[02:47:11.340 --> 02:47:13.580]  beating up his girlfriend and you come over and say something and they rob you
[02:47:13.580 --> 02:47:16.540]  or whatever i mean it's just it's it's sad that all
[02:47:16.540 --> 02:47:21.340]  we have is the police in so many areas because we don't trust each other
[02:47:21.340 --> 02:47:24.380]  and then now the police have gotten so corrupted some areas that's that form
[02:47:24.380 --> 02:47:28.300]  it's a seizure that we can't trust them it's game over
[02:47:28.300 --> 02:47:31.180]  folks this has been engineered and i don't know all
[02:47:31.180 --> 02:47:34.140]  the answers i just know i don't want to lose our
[02:47:34.140 --> 02:47:37.500]  civilization to corruption
[02:47:38.780 --> 02:47:43.100]  and i know that if we promote good policing and support good police
[02:47:43.100 --> 02:47:48.540]  then good police will have backing and the bad guys can be forced out
[02:47:48.540 --> 02:47:52.860]  and the police will listen to patriots if we are supportive on things we can
[02:47:52.860 --> 02:47:56.060]  support and then in a professional way disagree with what we
[02:47:56.060 --> 02:47:59.660]  know is wrong vehemently but not from a position of hating
[02:47:59.660 --> 02:48:02.700]  people and believe me when you're out of demonstration the cops are shoving on
[02:48:02.700 --> 02:48:07.580]  you and violating your first amendment you know you start hating them
[02:48:07.580 --> 02:48:10.620]  and that's popular you know i start yelling at cops start taking my jacket
[02:48:10.620 --> 02:48:13.500]  off at Dallas saying all right you just pushed over a guy with his little six
[02:48:13.500 --> 02:48:15.820]  year old daughter let's get i mean i was ready to fight
[02:48:15.820 --> 02:48:19.020]  at that point they got radioed and basically left immediately because they
[02:48:19.020 --> 02:48:22.220]  could tell the crowd went from being pushed back to i mean it was real i
[02:48:22.220 --> 02:48:25.340]  mean it's like they they knew the and so you say well they're good cops they
[02:48:25.340 --> 02:48:26.860]  didn't just want to get in a fight with me
[02:48:26.860 --> 02:48:31.180]  they would obviously want it at the end
[02:48:33.420 --> 02:48:36.220]  i mean that was just a year and a half ago folks that i came
[02:48:36.220 --> 02:48:40.060]  one inch from getting in a fight with the Dallas well there wasn't the Dallas
[02:48:40.060 --> 02:48:44.140]  police department it was the uh obama run county
[02:48:44.140 --> 02:48:49.580]  sheriff dallas county and when i saw them push that guy over with a six year
[02:48:49.580 --> 02:48:52.860]  old daughter on her shoulders and her crying i just said that's it we got to
[02:48:52.860 --> 02:48:56.060]  fight him and we tried to uh and it wasn't like a big thing in
[02:48:56.060 --> 02:48:59.420]  high school you take your jacket off to deescalate i was pulling my stuff off
[02:48:59.420 --> 02:49:02.700]  because i was getting ready man i mean it's just an instinctive level
[02:49:02.700 --> 02:49:07.500]  you don't attack little girls but at the same time
[02:49:07.500 --> 02:49:10.380]  they realized what they'd done and just said okay we better shut this down
[02:49:10.380 --> 02:49:14.300]  they were following orders they didn't like it some of them were thugs
[02:49:14.300 --> 02:49:19.820]  so i and some of the listeners loved that that they could watch a live video
[02:49:19.820 --> 02:49:22.780]  of me being pushed around by the cops and then saying all right let's kick their
[02:49:22.780 --> 02:49:26.460]  ass and all this people watching it loved it
[02:49:26.460 --> 02:49:31.180]  but you know what that's how we're going to lose this country
[02:49:31.180 --> 02:49:35.100]  that's how we're going to lose this civilization
[02:49:35.820 --> 02:49:39.180]  that's how we're going to do it folks and the globalists are going to sit out
[02:49:39.180 --> 02:49:44.220]  in switzerland and paris and london and luxenberg and money carlo and grand
[02:49:44.220 --> 02:49:46.940]  cayman i'm not bashing those countries i'm just
[02:49:46.940 --> 02:49:51.020]  saying that's where they're at they're going to sit there laughing at us while
[02:49:51.020 --> 02:49:54.140]  we do this like it's a football game or something well my life's not a football
[02:49:54.140 --> 02:49:56.460]  game and civil war is not a football game
[02:49:56.460 --> 02:49:59.740]  i'm done preaching about it but you can see how they destabilize they give all
[02:49:59.740 --> 02:50:02.220]  kind of a new base now they're going to attack us
[02:50:02.220 --> 02:50:07.660]  the attacks are going to be real anybody tries to stop them before they happen
[02:50:07.660 --> 02:50:10.860]  you'll get a bullet in your head
[02:50:11.020 --> 02:50:14.220]  any cops try to expose it's being promoted by government they're going to
[02:50:14.220 --> 02:50:17.580]  get shot like this police chief
[02:50:17.580 --> 02:50:21.260]  we're in a lot of trouble folks evil's taken over and we need to come together
[02:50:21.260 --> 02:50:24.300]  for the bill of rights constitution family rights
[02:50:24.300 --> 02:50:28.620]  private property right to self-defense and promote ideas
[02:50:28.620 --> 02:50:32.860]  not promote fighting black against white cop against citizen
[02:50:32.860 --> 02:50:36.860]  that's what you see out of msnbc that's the agenda they're promoting
[02:50:36.860 --> 02:50:40.220]  that's what they want to do they want us all of each other's throats
[02:50:40.220 --> 02:50:45.420]  so they won't notice when they swindle us devaluing the dollar so we won't
[02:50:45.420 --> 02:50:48.940]  notice all the globalists absolutely got this country
[02:50:48.940 --> 02:50:52.860]  we're going to come back and go to quarry and chad
[02:50:52.860 --> 02:50:59.260]  and rich and jerry and jay and many others stay with me
[02:50:59.260 --> 02:51:02.620]  a little over a year ago i began to do a lot of research
[02:51:02.620 --> 02:51:06.380]  into why even if i had a pretty good size meal that i was still starving
[02:51:06.380 --> 02:51:10.620]  and my research led me to a well-known fact that most of the soils that we
[02:51:10.620 --> 02:51:13.820]  grow our crops on here in the united states and across the industrialized
[02:51:13.820 --> 02:51:17.980]  world are almost completely depleted of almost all of the key
[02:51:17.980 --> 02:51:22.220]  minerals and trace elements that our bodies need to rebuild themselves
[02:51:22.220 --> 02:51:26.140]  fight off cancer and be healthy i then searched out the best

[02:56:32.220 --> 02:56:36.220]  uh the last king of scotland who killed 300 000 people in a matter of five years
[02:56:36.220 --> 02:56:39.340]  when he exiled that's where he went and lived on

[02:56:43.020 --> 02:56:47.740]  saudi arabia and our ally but um on a separate thing

[02:56:52.940 --> 02:56:55.740]  they've reported officials said and paris said that um
[02:56:55.740 --> 02:57:00.220]  wasn't a matter of if it was a matter of when and that uh security had been pulled

[02:57:05.100 --> 02:57:08.620]  want to get your take on that and there's something about the um also about the no go
[02:57:08.620 --> 02:57:12.380]  zones that are over there that are big deal going on over there
[02:57:12.380 --> 02:57:18.860]  and i was watching on my second issue i was watching american heroes channel
[02:57:18.860 --> 02:57:23.260]  and there was a thing called a shadow government military contractors
[02:57:23.260 --> 02:57:26.780]  yeah there was a shadow government in place publicly it was denied previously
[02:57:26.780 --> 02:57:29.580]  that's what i mean it's just a coming out of all this
[02:57:29.580 --> 02:57:37.740]  yes look the known cia handler of all the major attacks was behind this again
[02:57:37.740 --> 02:57:41.500]  show they're real terrorists but they were given a base given money protected
[02:57:41.500 --> 02:57:45.740]  allowed to get rpgs in allowed to do all this the police chief that was in the
[02:57:45.740 --> 02:57:48.940]  jurisdiction where they were finally taken out got shot a couple times in the
[02:57:48.940 --> 02:57:52.700]  head while writing a report that's up on info wars dot com the whole thing
[02:57:52.700 --> 02:57:56.860]  is very very suspicious it's meant to then be able
[02:57:56.860 --> 02:58:02.060]  to roll out fear and they're saying it's like the war on drugs it'll never end
[02:58:02.060 --> 02:58:05.420]  the war on i mean i thought we defeated al-qaeda just three years ago oh now
[02:58:05.420 --> 02:58:09.980]  they're back they were the syrian rebels our buddies now there are enemies this
[02:58:09.980 --> 02:58:13.900]  is so transparent so my answer is whether they're real or not
[02:58:13.900 --> 02:58:17.180]  don't take my liberties the answer is arm the citizens like the head of
[02:58:17.180 --> 02:58:20.620]  interpol said last year when people connected to obama attacked at
[02:58:20.620 --> 02:58:23.900]  shopping mall and the head of interpol said the answers
[02:58:23.900 --> 02:58:29.660]  armed the citizens right exactly this office is full of concealed carry
[02:58:29.660 --> 02:58:34.380]  people and m4s and 308s and you name it i mean
[02:58:34.380 --> 02:58:38.220]  and riot shotguns but we're not a target because we're not defenseless

[03:00:28.620 --> 03:00:35.500]  go to rich jerry and others yeah um hey alex how's it going us
[03:00:35.500 --> 03:00:39.740]  i wish i had more time to talk about it but earlier when you were talking a
[03:00:39.740 --> 03:00:43.660]  month about climate i was just wondering how
[03:00:43.660 --> 03:00:46.940]  you can have a discussion about climate without bringing up
[03:00:46.940 --> 03:00:50.860]  uh geoengineering if i could get your
[03:00:50.860 --> 03:00:54.860]  take on that you see that's the plan the un says they need geoengineering to
[03:00:54.860 --> 03:00:57.980]  save us from global warming it's already going on
[03:00:57.980 --> 03:01:01.180]  they can then target areas of people they want to starve and stuff
[03:01:01.180 --> 03:01:05.260]  so exactly next time montan's on i'll bring up geoengineering
[03:01:05.260 --> 03:01:10.540]  because it's it's it's the globalists that are in control of it
[03:01:10.540 --> 03:01:15.100]  and so who knows what they'll do with it to terrorize people into pay global
[03:01:15.100 --> 03:01:17.980]  taxes uh or you know you'll get flooded
[03:01:17.980 --> 03:01:21.260]  absolutely it's a great point
[03:01:21.660 --> 03:01:26.220]  yes i agree because i i don't know what's going on with it i watch every day
[03:01:26.220 --> 03:01:31.100]  after a lot so good points you know we said it
[03:01:31.100 --> 03:01:35.980]  was coming an electronic pearl harbor a cyber attack to push
[03:01:35.980 --> 03:01:39.260]  through all the draconian laws they're just now introducing and sure enough
[03:01:39.260 --> 03:01:45.340]  isis isis is hacking the pentagon successfully who
[03:01:45.340 --> 03:01:48.940]  buys any of this it's like saying north korea
[03:01:48.940 --> 03:01:52.540]  hacked uh the interview and turned out they didn't
[03:01:52.540 --> 03:01:56.220]  rich in california thanks for holding
[03:01:56.220 --> 03:01:59.900]  yes uh earlier you're talking about carbon burning
[03:01:59.900 --> 03:02:04.220]  fossil fuel and carbon dioxide in the atmosphere i like to suggest that uh
[03:02:04.220 --> 03:02:08.940]  the real issue is the concentration of oxygen and
[03:02:08.940 --> 03:02:13.100]  for example when you burn fossil fuel you're combining an atom of carbon with
[03:02:13.100 --> 03:02:16.780]  two atoms of oxygen and that's right aren't oxygen
[03:02:16.780 --> 03:02:20.780]  levels dropping they are and i'm suggesting that while i'm not
[03:02:20.780 --> 03:02:24.940]  against fossil fuel i'm suggesting more efficient machinery
[03:02:24.940 --> 03:02:28.860]  and i agree now we need to clean up dirty industry and that's the reasonable
[03:02:28.860 --> 03:02:32.540]  area and and exactly
[03:02:33.020 --> 03:02:37.420]  yeah carbon dioxide for example when you have a
[03:02:37.420 --> 03:02:41.820]  these automobiles could be more efficient uh i understand that when you
[03:02:41.820 --> 03:02:45.900]  burn up for a gallon of fuel gasoline you put in 20
[03:02:45.900 --> 03:02:50.380]  pounds of carbon dioxide in the air and of course i would like to debate
[03:02:50.380 --> 03:02:55.820]  uh mr montan about carbon dioxide he says for example 75
[03:02:55.820 --> 03:03:00.380]  750 million years ago the concentration of
[03:03:00.380 --> 03:03:03.900]  carbon dioxide was 15 tons higher well maybe so but
[03:03:03.900 --> 03:03:07.020]  human beings probably weren't around then well here's the deal they've done
[03:03:07.020 --> 03:03:10.140]  studies plants grow a lot faster with higher carbon dioxide
[03:03:10.140 --> 03:03:13.340]  more oxygen is put out i think the answer to get more oxygen
[03:03:13.340 --> 03:03:17.180]  is to get more carbon dioxide we are it is a trace gas sir
[03:03:17.180 --> 03:03:21.260]  and and and most scientists i've talked to say it would be better if it was higher
[03:03:21.260 --> 03:03:25.660]  all i know is this the carbon tax is about controlling human activity
[03:03:25.660 --> 03:03:29.340]  and micromanaging everything and as a scam i don't want to pay to
[03:03:29.340 --> 03:03:33.260]  al gore and obama and lord rothchild every time i gas up or when i do
[03:03:33.260 --> 03:03:35.740]  anything it's just a total scam but good to hear from you brother you made some
[03:03:35.740 --> 03:03:40.060]  good points uh jerry and georgia you're on the air
