[00:00.000 --> 00:04.680]  Ladies and gentlemen, this world is in so much crisis.
[00:04.680 --> 00:09.200]  I think sometimes I shouldn't even come in with intro music, like it's a show or entertainment
[00:09.200 --> 00:11.040]  because it's not.
[00:11.040 --> 00:14.480]  Survival of liberty is not a game.
[00:14.480 --> 00:15.480]  Incredible.
[00:15.480 --> 00:19.240]  Obama has come out and said there's little difference between communism and capitalism.
[00:19.240 --> 00:22.200]  And of course, they're trying to ban just the name Trump on campuses.
[00:22.200 --> 00:24.000]  Here's a John Bowne report on it.
[00:24.000 --> 00:30.640]  Students of college students in fear, close quote, in Atlanta after Trump 2016 chalked
[00:30.640 --> 00:32.000]  across campus.
[00:32.000 --> 00:34.600]  Not Trump KKK, which the false flaggers do.
[00:34.600 --> 00:35.600]  No, no, no.
[00:35.600 --> 00:40.280]  Trump 2016, and they're now having psychologists in meetings and having to cancel part of the
[00:40.280 --> 00:48.160]  school as everyone goes in and says, we're scared, we're so much robbed, it was almost
[00:48.160 --> 00:49.320]  as bad as Yale.
[00:49.320 --> 00:53.960]  And the two professors over that department said on email saying, listen, costume party
[00:53.960 --> 00:54.960]  is a part of freedom.
[00:54.960 --> 00:55.960]  This is true liberalism.
[00:55.960 --> 00:59.400]  You're allowed to, you know, have different ideas and dress like you want.
[00:59.400 --> 01:01.520]  And just, you know, you have your freedom as well.
[01:01.520 --> 01:04.200]  And so they caught him out in the square and began screaming at him and threatening him
[01:04.200 --> 01:12.560]  and threatening to hit him and going, I'm scared, I can't even scream as loud and as
[01:12.560 --> 01:17.120]  hysterically and as freaked out as they didn't guess what, you'll fire both of them fired
[01:17.120 --> 01:19.640]  the people that dare say that was freedom.
[01:19.640 --> 01:25.320]  Civil War's journalist, Don Salazar writes, several students at Emory University in Atlanta
[01:25.320 --> 01:32.520]  requested a meeting with the school's president after the words, Trump 2016 were scrawled
[01:32.520 --> 01:34.120]  across campus.
[01:34.120 --> 01:40.200]  The college news site, the tab, published several photos of the chalking.
[01:40.200 --> 01:46.200]  Jim Wagner, the university president said Tuesday he had spoken with some 40 to 50 students
[01:46.200 --> 01:52.760]  after they claim they were triggered by the words, Trump 2016 and other pro Trump messages
[01:52.760 --> 01:56.800]  written in chalk on buildings and sidewalks around campus.
[01:56.800 --> 02:02.440]  The students said they were threatened by the intimidating messages and voiced genuine
[02:02.440 --> 02:07.840]  concern and pain to administrators, reports the Associated Press.
[02:07.840 --> 02:13.120]  The Emory Wheel reports one student said, I'm supposed to feel comfortable and safe here,
[02:13.120 --> 02:18.320]  but this man is being supported by students on our campus and our administration shows
[02:18.320 --> 02:22.560]  that they, by their silence, support it as well.
[02:22.560 --> 02:26.400]  And I don't deserve to feel afraid at my school, she added.
[02:26.400 --> 02:31.080]  But individual students soon began to offer more detailed, personal reactions to feelings
[02:31.080 --> 02:35.400]  of racial tension that Trump and his ideology bring to the fore.
[02:35.400 --> 02:40.440]  Has this juvenile corrosion of freedom of choice reached other American campuses?
[02:40.440 --> 02:45.560]  The University of Texas, for example, if you saw Trump 2016 written on the ground right
[02:45.560 --> 02:47.120]  here, would that offend you?
[02:47.120 --> 02:50.760]  Would you rally with other students and alert the university president?
[02:50.760 --> 02:51.760]  It would offend me.
[02:51.760 --> 02:55.120]  I'm not sure I would go get the president in the university, but I'd be happy if someone
[02:55.120 --> 02:56.120]  did.
[02:56.120 --> 02:57.880]  I had Sandy try to rob it out.
[02:57.880 --> 03:02.520]  I think just goes to show a lot about where our political process is at right now.
[03:02.520 --> 03:06.680]  So just be kind of, I think, disappointed is my main reaction.
[03:06.680 --> 03:07.680]  No.
[03:07.680 --> 03:08.680]  Why not?
[03:08.680 --> 03:09.680]  Why wouldn't you be offended?
[03:09.680 --> 03:13.120]  Why would you have a right to put in chalk Trump 2016 if they support him?
[03:13.120 --> 03:16.360]  I may not support him, but that doesn't mean that others aren't supporting him and they
[03:16.360 --> 03:17.680]  have a right in chalk.
[03:17.680 --> 03:18.680]  It's not graffiti.
[03:18.680 --> 03:19.680]  It's not graffiti.
[03:19.680 --> 03:23.920]  I'd be fine if people did that, as long as they don't infringe on the rights of others
[03:23.920 --> 03:28.360]  to write Clinton or Kasich or anyone else in chalk right next to it.
[03:28.360 --> 03:30.760]  Why would it offend you?
[03:30.760 --> 03:34.680]  Well, first of all, nobody should be writing their opinions on public streets.
[03:34.680 --> 03:38.840]  It's not the opinion of all the students in the body, and it shouldn't be represented
[03:38.840 --> 03:47.320]  in your university, and because I don't want Trump to win president for 2016, because I
[03:47.320 --> 03:57.560]  think he's a dangerous man who is dishonest, he lies, and he's using his money to manipulate
[03:57.560 --> 04:00.680]  poor people into voting for him.
[04:00.680 --> 04:03.160]  You can express political beliefs wherever you want.
[04:03.160 --> 04:07.320]  I think the First Amendment gives you that right, but I would just be disappointed, I
[04:07.320 --> 04:08.320]  think.
[04:08.320 --> 04:12.080]  I think it's society's becoming more polarized.
[04:12.080 --> 04:16.720]  People are either right-wing or left-wing at very extreme positions, and the moderates
[04:16.720 --> 04:21.240]  aren't very talkative and seem to be frozen out, so you have to support extreme positions
[04:21.240 --> 04:23.240]  to get elected, and that's no good anymore.
[04:23.240 --> 04:27.220]  Most of the students I tried to talk to had their heads buried in their phones.
[04:27.220 --> 04:32.160]  The Independent reports the more time young adults spend on social media, the more likely
[04:32.160 --> 04:36.440]  they are to become depressed, while they haven't seen anything yet.
[04:36.440 --> 04:41.400]  Wait until Obama's policies come home to roost, as young millennial men and women are
[04:41.400 --> 04:44.920]  drafted and sent to the front lines, fighting the global...
[04:44.920 --> 04:48.600]  That's right, we're going into a total, fascist, worldwide tyranny.
[04:48.600 --> 04:54.360]  The full report by John Bown is up on infowars.com, crybaby college students, bludgeoned freedom
[04:54.360 --> 04:55.360]  of speech.
[04:55.360 --> 04:57.480]  This is going to be an over-the-top broadcast.
[04:57.480 --> 05:00.400]  I'm telling you, one for the S3 books, get ready.
[05:00.400 --> 05:10.040]  I've got a lot of things on my plate, but my top priority is to defeat ISIL, and to
[05:10.040 --> 05:12.000]  eliminate the scourge of...
[05:12.000 --> 05:16.520]  And indeed, Obama has been very busy this week, playing dominoes, doing the wave at
[05:16.520 --> 05:19.160]  a baseball game, and dancing the tango.
[05:19.160 --> 05:24.400]  Oh, and rewriting history by telling a group of Argentinians that there is little difference
[05:24.400 --> 05:26.560]  between communism and capitalism.
[05:26.560 --> 05:27.560]  Say what?
[05:27.560 --> 05:32.000]  Obama went on to praise Cuba's socialist system under dictator Raul Castro.
[05:32.000 --> 05:36.760]  He touted the country's free access to basic education and healthcare, although he acknowledged
[05:36.760 --> 05:42.120]  that Havana itself looks like it did in the 1950s because the economy is not working.
[05:42.120 --> 05:46.240]  Indeed, that's one of the great achievements of capitalism, innovation.
[05:46.240 --> 05:50.600]  If you want to school your friends once and for all on the difference between communism
[05:50.600 --> 05:56.200]  and capitalism, visit the Alex Jones YouTube channel and share the video, Why Capitalism
[05:56.200 --> 05:57.200]  is Great.

[07:57.080 --> 08:07.840]  Thank you for your specialness coming to you.
[08:07.840 --> 08:09.840]  Waging war on corruption.
[08:09.840 --> 08:12.760]  All right, you're on, Joe.
[08:12.760 --> 08:17.840]  It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the Infowar.
[08:17.840 --> 08:33.440]  Just yesterday, I talked about how in Sweden, in Germany, in France, in many other areas
[08:33.440 --> 08:41.600]  of Western Europe, the college campuses and the high schools and also the elementary schools,
[08:41.600 --> 08:48.920]  part of your credit, you go to a Muslim area or you go to a Muslim ghetto and you apologize
[08:48.920 --> 08:51.720]  to the Muslims for the crusades.
[08:51.720 --> 08:57.720]  You give them flowers, you make them food, you clean their homes and the Muslims laugh
[08:57.720 --> 09:03.800]  at you because these are not the cultured Muslims that I grew up knowing, the upper
[09:03.800 --> 09:09.040]  class and from freer countries, when Iraq had been freer or Egypt had been freer or
[09:09.040 --> 09:13.080]  Jordan had been freer, really nice, cool, smart people.
[09:13.080 --> 09:21.120]  These are the lower class Sunni invaders of the entire Middle East that are the majority
[09:21.120 --> 09:25.480]  that are running around attacking everybody and then bullying their own people to be as
[09:25.480 --> 09:28.680]  hardcore and as extreme as possible.
[09:28.680 --> 09:34.440]  And I was thinking about all these articles I've seen the last year where the liberal
[09:34.440 --> 09:40.800]  feminist groups in Germany came out and said, it is German blonde haired blue eyed men raping
[09:40.800 --> 09:43.240]  women in Cologne.
[09:43.240 --> 09:49.600]  It was on video that it was the Wahhabist invaders who had invaded Syria and then they
[09:49.600 --> 09:55.280]  would blame Syria on the news when they quote told the truth and said, no, actually, it's
[09:55.280 --> 09:58.640]  all Syrian or North African refugees.
[09:58.640 --> 10:00.320]  Even that was a lie too.
[10:00.320 --> 10:05.640]  It was almost exclusively just North Africans or Sunni groups out of Saudi Arabia and other
[10:05.640 --> 10:07.440]  areas that had invaded.
[10:07.440 --> 10:10.720]  So it's lie within lie within lie and you can pull those articles up.
[10:10.720 --> 10:15.800]  But I was thinking about it when I was on air yesterday how that just doesn't even sound
[10:15.800 --> 10:19.160]  true when I was saying it.
[10:19.160 --> 10:24.720]  It doesn't sound true that the national feminist groups and the national liberal groups, the
[10:24.720 --> 10:35.080]  Green Party and others in official newspapers with straight faces came out and said, German
[10:35.080 --> 10:40.080]  men did this and it's going to be good when there's no more original Germans.
[10:40.080 --> 10:44.400]  That was all over the news, TV, der Spiegel, you name it.
[10:44.400 --> 10:47.920]  And you say that flies in the face of logic.
[10:47.920 --> 10:49.360]  That's the whole point.
[10:49.360 --> 10:53.640]  Everything the globalists do is the end of logic, the end of prosperity, the end of two
[10:53.640 --> 10:55.840]  plus two equals four.
[10:55.840 --> 10:59.480]  And if you can convince people two plus two equals five, you have them.
[10:59.480 --> 11:03.800]  Winston Smith, while being tortured at the Ministry of Love, that's why it's loving,
[11:03.800 --> 11:08.720]  he worked at the Ministry of Truth, it was one of the Ministry of Lies, he's being tortured.
[11:08.720 --> 11:10.720]  And they go, we know you weren't rebelling against us.
[11:10.720 --> 11:13.680]  We just want to torture and kill people.
[11:13.680 --> 11:15.600]  You're too smart.
[11:15.600 --> 11:18.000]  O'Brien torturing him says, I'm smart too.
[11:18.000 --> 11:19.160]  They'll probably torture me to death.
[11:19.160 --> 11:20.320]  I love it.
[11:20.320 --> 11:21.320]  I hate beauty.
[11:21.320 --> 11:22.320]  I hate goodness.
[11:22.320 --> 11:23.320]  I'm a priest of power.
[11:23.320 --> 11:25.440]  I'm going to rip your teeth out.
[11:25.440 --> 11:28.480]  And I'm going to torture you for three months until you aren't even human anymore because
[11:28.480 --> 11:32.040]  I am part of the cult of power and I'm going to ruin everything good.
[11:32.040 --> 11:33.600]  I am a devil worshipper.
[11:33.600 --> 11:39.520]  Now, how did Eric Blair of one of the highest, most elite intellectual families, interbred
[11:39.520 --> 11:45.200]  with the elite eugenics families of the Huxleys, the Wedgewoods, the Galtons, and the Darwin's?
[11:45.200 --> 11:46.400]  How did he write that book?
[11:46.400 --> 11:51.160]  And then you read it and think it's a hard book, but then you actually study the totalitarianism.
[11:51.160 --> 11:52.520]  That's what it is.
[11:52.520 --> 11:58.560]  Because he was led into the Fabian Socialist, he was in the OSS, he was in MI6 after that,
[11:58.560 --> 12:02.840]  and the plan was so evil, he wrote that book and then he wrote a bunch of papers.
[12:02.840 --> 12:03.840]  I've got a textbook.
[12:03.840 --> 12:04.840]  I ought to bring it in.
[12:04.840 --> 12:07.920]  I was trying to find it in storage the other day that I read in college, a whole textbook
[12:07.920 --> 12:12.240]  on him with his letters and his articles and his nonfiction.
[12:12.240 --> 12:16.960]  I probably read everything George Arwell wrote, Eric Blair.
[12:16.960 --> 12:20.200]  And he says in there, I was led into the inner sanctum.
[12:20.200 --> 12:21.360]  This is what happened.
[12:21.360 --> 12:23.520]  He wrote that about three months before he died.
[12:23.520 --> 12:24.520]  They killed him, folks.
[12:24.520 --> 12:27.240]  He didn't die of tuberculosis.
[12:27.240 --> 12:30.240]  And I would read that in high school and then read it again in college and I've read it
[12:30.240 --> 12:34.760]  like three more times since then and I cry now and I'm serious.
[12:34.760 --> 12:37.920]  Not like retching when your grandma dies.
[12:37.920 --> 12:44.200]  I tears just start coming out of my brain so threatened by the evil that all I want
[12:44.200 --> 12:45.200]  to do is warn people.
[12:45.200 --> 12:49.680]  That's why I'm tearing myself apart on air because I'm forcing myself to admit this is
[12:49.680 --> 12:50.680]  going on.
[12:50.680 --> 12:57.640]  I see these predators creeping up all around us and I know the public can't handle it.
[12:57.640 --> 13:02.840]  I can't handle it either but digressing before I get into the bombshell news because it illustrates
[13:02.840 --> 13:07.960]  the headspace that they basically get us into.
[13:07.960 --> 13:17.280]  I'm sitting there yesterday just just mentioning a few of the crazy things that aren't crazy.
[13:17.280 --> 13:20.960]  We say they're environmentalist wackos because they want to bankrupt the whole country and
[13:20.960 --> 13:22.440]  turn off all our electricity basically.
[13:22.440 --> 13:23.440]  No, they're not.
[13:23.440 --> 13:24.440]  It's a plan.
[13:24.440 --> 13:27.240]  They're moving the industry into dictatorships they control.
[13:27.240 --> 13:28.960]  It's global governance.
[13:28.960 --> 13:32.400]  It's economic warfare in their own words.
[13:32.400 --> 13:39.360]  Using rigged stock markets, rigged currency, rigged interest rates on record to shut everything
[13:39.360 --> 13:41.120]  down that isn't controlled by them.
[13:41.120 --> 13:53.320]  It is a 100% total, complete, abject annihilation of capitalism, of free market, choice driven,
[13:53.320 --> 14:02.200]  demand driven, quality driven, free association driven, renaissance driven, flaming liberal
[14:02.200 --> 14:13.440]  driven, cornucopia the spirit of Christmas present that God gave us.
[14:13.440 --> 14:22.960]  And instead it is leviathan death.
[14:22.960 --> 14:25.880]  And I was just thinking about it and I talked about how I want Paul Watson, I meant to call
[14:25.880 --> 14:33.240]  him to stay to take like the 30 or 40 wild things where they go out and say, we're sorry
[14:33.240 --> 14:34.880]  Muslims that you have to rape us.
[14:34.880 --> 14:35.880]  Here's flowers.
[14:35.880 --> 14:40.120]  Oh, and, you know, all the rest of it and it'll be so good when all Germans have been
[14:40.120 --> 14:41.120]  bred out.
[14:41.120 --> 14:42.120]  We're an evil people.
[14:42.120 --> 14:46.160]  This is said by the head of the Green Party, you know, on national TV.
[14:46.160 --> 14:51.680]  These are sick Freakazoid's, okay, truth is they just hate everybody.
[14:51.680 --> 14:54.920]  They want total control because they're going to exempt themselves from everything they're
[14:54.920 --> 15:00.160]  doing to you to total fault.
[15:00.160 --> 15:01.360]  And then I saw this article today.
[15:01.360 --> 15:07.600]  I mean, it's every day gateway pundit info wars.com dozens of Swedish women show support
[15:07.600 --> 15:13.520]  for Islam by taking selfies in hijab after Brussels massacre.
[15:13.520 --> 15:19.600]  And they go and apologize and say that Western men are being mean to women basically.
[15:19.600 --> 15:24.280]  So they flip reality and they make it all about how Western men are bad.
[15:24.280 --> 15:28.080]  This is the cutting edge feminism is to defend Islam.
[15:28.080 --> 15:31.840]  Swedish women are showing their support for Islam by taking selfies after the Brussels
[15:31.840 --> 15:34.840]  bombings in hajibs.
[15:34.840 --> 15:40.280]  This is from hajib prophet website where the approving Muslim men tell the feminists
[15:40.280 --> 15:42.800]  what to do and they thank them.
[15:42.800 --> 15:46.560]  The violence against Muslim women has increased and is extremely worrying.
[15:46.560 --> 15:47.960]  Their basic rights are not being respected.
[15:47.960 --> 15:57.120]  Their civil rights are being respected and we need to put a stop to this.
[15:57.120 --> 16:02.040]  Being called names in the streets, getting their scarfs and hajibs ripped off their heads
[16:02.040 --> 16:06.560]  and being slandered has become a daily routine for many Muslim women.
[16:06.560 --> 16:12.360]  And then it goes into how horrible the Westerners are to them.
[16:12.360 --> 16:16.000]  And of course, these women ought to just wear hoods over their heads like most of the Muslim
[16:16.000 --> 16:21.240]  countries and have their genitals cut off and then live with a dog chained around their
[16:21.240 --> 16:27.080]  neck or have acid poured on their face to really live the true Muslim lifestyle.
[16:27.080 --> 16:32.400]  How about you being a slave brothel that are legal in most areas of the Middle East?
[16:32.400 --> 16:35.360]  Slave brothels, that's real feminist, isn't it?
[16:35.360 --> 16:38.520]  They call them harems.
[16:38.520 --> 16:43.680]  We have set out to arrange this walk because we cannot allow this behavior any longer in
[16:43.680 --> 16:49.440]  our society anymore, come and show your support Friday, the 26th, 1700.
[16:49.440 --> 16:53.720]  In Stockholm, this is Stockholm Syndrome, isn't it funny, it's in Stockholm?
[16:53.720 --> 17:03.920]  We will walk from Cluthor Huston, Platon to the Mosque at Med-Bord, God-Poplaston.
[17:03.920 --> 17:06.160]  This will be a silent demonstration.
[17:06.160 --> 17:11.000]  Wow, women have absolutely no rights under Islam and these brain dead women are holding
[17:11.000 --> 17:15.440]  a rally in support of the barbarians, unreal.
[17:15.440 --> 17:19.280]  And look at this, the approving Muslim sites are dozens of Swedish women show their support
[17:19.280 --> 17:25.600]  for Islam by taking selfies in the hajib, Instagram, isn't that just cute?
[17:25.600 --> 17:31.000]  Hey, how about you take selfies next to photos of women being hung or stoned to death, in
[17:31.000 --> 17:34.800]  fact, just Google, women being stoned, women, don't show it on TV, I don't want to show
[17:34.800 --> 17:40.040]  it, I can't watch women getting killed, Facebook, Twitter, you name it.
[17:40.040 --> 17:43.840]  Because if we show it, the Muslim sites come in, they're trying to censor us right now
[17:43.840 --> 17:51.120]  and file fake complaints to shut us down saying we shouldn't show their handiwork.
[17:51.120 --> 17:58.080]  That's right, the handiwork's okay, we're the bad evil western pigs because you know
[17:58.080 --> 17:59.360]  why, don't you?
[17:59.360 --> 18:02.000]  We showed it and we don't support it.
[18:02.000 --> 18:06.240]  You see in those countries, in the less radical ones, women have to cover everything but their
[18:06.240 --> 18:13.600]  faces and look down and don't talk to a man unless you're talked to.
[18:13.600 --> 18:16.320]  Basically slave plantation level stuff.
[18:16.320 --> 18:20.320]  But in many of the countries, probably about half of them, they got to wear full outfits
[18:20.320 --> 18:23.080]  where your face can't be seen.
[18:23.080 --> 18:27.280]  Invisible people can't drive a car and it doesn't matter, they push it on universities,
[18:27.280 --> 18:30.480]  they preach it, they promote it, I'm skipping this break, I can't help it, it's too important.
[18:30.480 --> 18:35.440]  This is a network break station, shouldn't be covering us up, folks, you see, you know.
[18:35.440 --> 18:40.200]  The network break comes up in about a couple minutes and then there's the regular break
[18:40.200 --> 18:45.680]  at 29 after stations.
[18:45.680 --> 18:50.360]  Just think about this and then just yesterday, they have the Swedish head of this culture
[18:50.360 --> 18:55.840]  program who took over the government funded tweet about Swedish culture, which if you
[18:55.840 --> 18:59.040]  go there, it's all foreign culture, that's how you destroy culture and throw it in your
[18:59.040 --> 19:03.240]  face and dominate you and break you and he says, I'm going to have sex with your daughter
[19:03.240 --> 19:06.640]  tonight, she's going to moan and call me daddy.
[19:06.640 --> 19:11.440]  That's a quote and of course he's not getting in trouble.
[19:11.440 --> 19:17.440]  The state is saying, absolutely, tell us the women belong to you and the Europeans that
[19:17.440 --> 19:21.000]  have been programmed from birth to roll over and be slaves, they roll over and show their
[19:21.000 --> 19:27.160]  bellies and the women put on the headdresses and run out with flowers and beg to be enslaved.
[19:27.160 --> 19:31.520]  This is what has happened and I'm not exaggerating it and this is going on at the universities
[19:31.520 --> 19:37.560]  where if they see Donald Trump 2016 written on shock, they begin convulsing, emergency
[19:37.560 --> 19:41.960]  psychologists are called, the dean talks to 40 plus people and the dean comes out and
[19:41.960 --> 19:45.640]  says, we're going to investigate this, this was meant to terrorize people.
[19:45.640 --> 19:50.240]  The word Donald Trump, we agree and all over the country, they're arresting people for
[19:50.240 --> 19:54.800]  even doing chalk on their own driveways because they want to train you that you're there's
[19:54.800 --> 20:00.480]  no lemonade stands, there's no Amish milk, there's no farmers markets, there's no underground
[20:00.480 --> 20:06.360]  economy, there's no communication and the greatest crime, the greatest crime is a bumper
[20:06.360 --> 20:10.080]  sticker on your car promoting liberty or chalking your own sidewalk.
[20:10.080 --> 20:16.720]  You will be taught to submit and if you'll submit to a bunch of arrogant, uneducated
[20:16.720 --> 20:27.120]  stupid people running around in basically third world pajamas and bossing you around,
[20:27.120 --> 20:28.120]  then you'll put up with anything.
[20:28.120 --> 20:31.120]  You'll put up with them saying your kids belong to the state and the word mother and father
[20:31.120 --> 20:32.600]  is bad.
[20:32.600 --> 20:36.200]  You'll go through the naked body scanners, you'll be checked when you come into the U.S.
[20:36.200 --> 20:40.520]  I first remember Man Cow about five, six years ago, I was on a show and he goes, yeah it's
[20:40.520 --> 20:44.120]  in the news today that people coming in from Saudi Arabia don't have to take their hoods
[20:44.120 --> 20:48.400]  off or don't have to be searched by the TSA or customs, they just go right through.
[20:48.400 --> 20:54.200]  I went and looked it up, it was true, I couldn't believe it and now it's in the news that Muslim
[20:54.200 --> 20:56.160]  brotherhood people coming in don't have to do it.
[20:56.160 --> 21:02.280]  I mean it's a joke but we do, we do, we have to take our crosses down, we have to submit,
[21:02.280 --> 21:07.200]  we have to roll over, we have to bow, we have to fetch, we have to grovel, this is our back
[21:07.200 --> 21:17.720]  being broken and every day I see the people that call themselves the left worshiping anything
[21:17.720 --> 21:22.760]  deviant, anything oppressive, anything sick, they say you don't have free will, you don't
[21:22.760 --> 21:27.280]  have common sense, you're just a biological robot, we program you.
[21:27.280 --> 21:30.080]  But we have all these rights and our feelings are so important and we're humans and we're
[21:30.080 --> 21:35.280]  beautiful because we're part of the establishment club allied with the state.
[21:35.280 --> 21:42.400]  Our ideas matter, we're a exalted protected group, everyone outside of it is an enemy
[21:42.400 --> 21:44.080]  and has nothing.
[21:44.080 --> 21:48.760]  We are exempt from Obamacare, we get free healthcare, that's what they get, the special
[21:48.760 --> 21:53.480]  to university students, all these groups, they opt in, they become part of the socialist
[21:53.480 --> 21:58.520]  boards and then it is selectively given to them, the free healthcare, the free housing,
[21:58.520 --> 22:04.640]  the free education, it's all select though and then they have disdain as all parasites
[22:04.640 --> 22:06.440]  do for their prey.
[22:06.440 --> 22:10.320]  When they see you running a business, paying all the taxes, jumping through the hoops,
[22:10.320 --> 22:14.640]  when they show up to inspect you, especially if they're socialists, they look at you with
[22:14.640 --> 22:19.600]  disdain and burning hate and they tell you line up and what's this and you tell me what's
[22:19.600 --> 22:24.160]  happening there and they just get off on it.
[22:24.160 --> 22:29.880]  Like all authoritarians and totalitarians do and the thing they relish the most is overthrowing
[22:29.880 --> 22:33.560]  logic and two plus two equals four, common sense.
[22:33.560 --> 22:38.560]  That's why they have the Pope come out and say Italy shouldn't take any of the Muslim
[22:38.560 --> 22:43.200]  migrants and the cultures don't work together and that they need to send in Italian troops
[22:43.200 --> 22:48.080]  into Albania, which they've done and he's got 100 foot, 200 foot walls depending on
[22:48.080 --> 22:52.760]  the area but he says we can't have walls and we can't check IDs and Donald Trump's not
[22:52.760 --> 22:58.440]  going to heaven and meanwhile the Pope kisses the feet of asylum seekers.
[22:58.440 --> 23:02.640]  The Pope's ritual where he washes and kisses the feet of 12 men took place at the center
[23:02.640 --> 23:08.520]  for asylum seekers just outside Rome confirms the Vatican.
[23:08.520 --> 23:13.520]  I wonder if he'll stop all the pedophilia and kiss the feet of those people that were
[23:13.520 --> 23:14.520]  abused.
[23:14.520 --> 23:18.560]  I wonder if he'll kiss the feet of the Italians that for decades have had to pay for the electricity
[23:18.560 --> 23:25.040]  for Vatican City, whether they're Catholic or not and Rome doesn't even pay for its
[23:25.040 --> 23:30.720]  own bills, the Vatican City in Rome and I'm not against Catholics themselves, I'm against
[23:30.720 --> 23:36.480]  a Jesuit socialist running around lecturing us, oh but he's not the only one, this is
[23:36.480 --> 23:44.920]  the time of lecturing isn't it?
[23:44.920 --> 23:48.920]  This is the time, here's the big story, it's on DrudgeReport.com, it needs to go the most
[23:48.920 --> 23:54.120]  viral of anything we've ever reported on because this is the key to everything right here.
[23:54.120 --> 24:00.520]  This is a true Rosetta Stone as so many stories are but this is a whopper.
[24:00.520 --> 24:06.880]  I've told you that I noticed something coming out of China about 18, 19 years ago, about
[24:06.880 --> 24:11.520]  97, I've been reading it in textbooks and it's being pushed at Chicago Business School,
[24:11.520 --> 24:20.360]  you name it and I would talk about it and the intellectual sophist phops out there
[24:20.360 --> 24:24.640]  that a pseudo-intellectual would say, Jones is crazy, there's been many articles written,
[24:24.640 --> 24:30.160]  he doesn't know the difference between fascism and socialism or communism, oh I do know the
[24:30.160 --> 24:34.880]  difference, I know who developed them, who deployed them, the central banks of Europe,
[24:34.880 --> 24:41.240]  it's all in actual academic level textbooks if you actually cared no reality and not what
[24:41.240 --> 24:50.560]  some twit told you in your quote college courses that are there to sabotage you and screw your
[24:50.560 --> 24:53.320]  mind up.
[24:53.320 --> 24:59.000]  You can actually go look at the last three Chinese presidents, they're dictators appointed
[24:59.000 --> 25:04.800]  by the Inter-Communist Bureau, the Politburo, kind of like they're announcing presidents
[25:04.800 --> 25:11.200]  and candidates and nominees now in America, oh silly kid, you don't, your vote doesn't
[25:11.200 --> 25:18.440]  count, see it's the time of the season now to let you know, your kids aren't yours, we're
[25:18.440 --> 25:25.600]  going to make you take shots, you didn't build your business, remember, remember all those
[25:25.600 --> 25:29.920]  times that communist leaders would bring in their annual Politburo meeting and have the
[25:29.920 --> 25:34.680]  first announcement before the doors were closed and it was secret and it would be, in fact
[25:34.680 --> 25:46.480]  search this guys, Chinese president, China has perfected capitalism through communism.
[25:46.480 --> 25:58.200]  Another quote is, Chinese president, communism is the ultimate expression of capitalism.
[25:58.200 --> 26:05.200]  Now you see we're getting down to real communism now folks, not you know spaceships and you
[26:05.200 --> 26:11.560]  know mural paintings about heaven and jetpacks and free love and everybody lives longer and
[26:11.560 --> 26:16.560]  everything's fun and of course it turns you into Moscow or turns you into North Korea,
[26:16.560 --> 26:22.160]  turns you into these hellholes.
[26:22.160 --> 26:27.160]  You see because capitalism was just a 18th and 19th century term for big robber barons
[26:27.160 --> 26:31.880]  trying to take over the Renaissance and manage it and talk about money and flow and being
[26:31.880 --> 26:36.040]  able to build things but it itself was never a true free market, it was an amalgamation
[26:36.040 --> 26:40.880]  of the old East India and Dutch East India Company and a lot of other elites and a mixture
[26:40.880 --> 26:45.960]  of letter of mark type licensure through government and a mixture of French mercantilism but it
[26:45.960 --> 26:56.800]  was a managed crony capitalist system.
[26:56.800 --> 26:59.280]  So think about that.
[26:59.280 --> 27:04.840]  So I explained that fascism and socialism and communism are all just different management
[27:04.840 --> 27:10.280]  systems that are very similar but different in how they're given out in textbooks to confuse
[27:10.280 --> 27:18.480]  the proletariat into accepting total centralization and the process where they bring you into socialism
[27:18.480 --> 27:22.960]  then communism or they may bring you into fascism but socialism gets you in debt, gets
[27:22.960 --> 27:28.400]  you dependent 30, 40 years then you collapse into fascism or outright communism for a period
[27:28.400 --> 27:33.960]  then there's a revolution and a reorganization and a quote capitalist system is brought in
[27:33.960 --> 27:40.600]  that actually just keeps a lesser form of command and control in control and has a servile
[27:40.600 --> 27:44.720]  population that goes to the next level of development and this is in all the textbooks,
[27:44.720 --> 27:48.440]  it's in the deliberate dumbing down of America with the Department of Education documents
[27:48.440 --> 27:55.200]  and it just says it as well, it's everywhere but we're about to enter in America into the
[27:55.200 --> 28:00.960]  long winter of the reeducation camps, the banning of speech, huge hordes of young people
[28:00.960 --> 28:05.700]  burning things down if the government doesn't do what they say with higher level multinationals
[28:05.700 --> 28:10.160]  directing the hordes with the government on the back side allied with them and people
[28:10.160 --> 28:13.480]  like George Soros, I mean they're coming.
[28:13.480 --> 28:19.920]  Just like Cuba is open now but only to a handful of companies, Microsoft, Google, General Motors
[28:19.920 --> 28:23.880]  and others and they're going to come in and carve up the incredibly rich country, the
[28:23.880 --> 28:29.520]  incredibly hard working smart people, they're going to come in with all these folks trained
[28:29.520 --> 28:32.920]  to work 18 hours a day and not complain and they're going to come in there and those are
[28:32.920 --> 28:37.160]  going to be some of the best robots the world ever saw.
[28:37.160 --> 28:43.920]  Now the criminals, the rebellious, the trash is all going to be shipped here but the communists
[28:43.920 --> 28:48.640]  are about to cash in just like in China on a quote one state managed capitalist economy
[28:48.640 --> 28:52.720]  with mobile execution vans and if you complain you'll be disappeared forever like they do
[28:52.720 --> 28:57.440]  on ESPN and no one said it was a scandal that ESPN didn't say that was wrong.
[28:57.440 --> 29:01.960]  We have our TV now broadcasting down there as people are beat up and disappeared and
[29:01.960 --> 29:05.160]  they're going good, get rid of him.
[29:05.160 --> 29:08.800]  Now that's quite a build up to our top story, isn't it?
[29:08.800 --> 29:11.480]  Here it is.
[29:11.480 --> 29:14.480]  Barack Obama, I'm sure you heard.
[29:14.480 --> 29:19.040]  Obama, there's little difference between communism and capitalism.
[29:19.040 --> 29:23.560]  Just choose from what works and actually no US news even picked this up till we put it
[29:23.560 --> 29:24.560]  out and Drudge picked it up.
[29:24.560 --> 29:27.400]  See because it's just meant to go into the radar.
[29:27.400 --> 29:31.680]  There's no difference between communism and capitalism.
[29:31.680 --> 29:39.600]  Now who was wrong about the real labels trendies and pseudo-intellectuals that got their degree
[29:39.600 --> 29:43.040]  in a crackerjack box in one of these fake universities?
[29:43.040 --> 29:44.440]  They're all fake, didn't you know?
[29:44.440 --> 29:46.720]  Oh, I was right again.
[29:46.720 --> 29:49.720]  They're about to bring us into the collapse phase, get ready, this is key.
[29:49.720 --> 29:53.440]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[29:53.440 --> 30:00.480]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[30:00.480 --> 30:10.680]  I've got a lot of things on my plate, but my top priority is to defeat ISIL and to eliminate
[30:10.680 --> 30:12.000]  the scourge of...
[30:12.000 --> 30:17.040]  And indeed Obama has been very busy this week, playing dominoes, doing the wave at a baseball
[30:17.040 --> 30:19.160]  game and dancing the tango.
[30:19.160 --> 30:24.480]  Oh, and rewriting history by telling a group of Argentinians that there is little difference
[30:24.480 --> 30:26.760]  between communism and capitalism.
[30:26.760 --> 30:27.760]  Say what?
[30:27.760 --> 30:32.040]  Obama went on to praise Cuba's socialist system under dictator Raul Castro.
[30:32.040 --> 30:36.800]  He touted the country's free access to basic education and healthcare, although he acknowledged
[30:36.800 --> 30:42.800]  that Havana itself looks like it did in the 1950s because the economy is not working.
[30:42.800 --> 30:46.280]  Indeed that's one of the great achievements of capitalism, innovation.
[30:46.280 --> 30:50.640]  If you want to school your friends once and for all on the difference between communism
[30:50.640 --> 30:56.240]  and capitalism, visit the Alex Jones YouTube channel and share the video why capitalism
[30:56.240 --> 30:57.240]  is great.
[30:57.240 --> 31:27.200]  I'm Alex Jones and I'll see you in the next video.
[31:27.240 --> 31:32.880]  We're introducing the best yet.
[31:32.880 --> 31:36.920]  The brand new Pro Pure Pro Max high performance shower filter.
[31:36.920 --> 31:41.800]  It removes and reduces over 200 contaminants while preserving a strong powerful flow.
[31:41.800 --> 31:46.400]  This new four stage filtration process helps protect the largest organ in your body, your
[31:46.400 --> 31:48.840]  skin from the unhealthy contaminants in the water.

[32:01.760 --> 32:05.040]  Thousands of years ago there was a basic form of chivalry.
[32:05.040 --> 32:09.920]  Our ancestors would hear the drums of war, giving the warriors of the tribe a chance
[32:09.920 --> 32:12.840]  to organize and prepare a defense.
[32:12.840 --> 32:19.000]  Sixty years ago when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs, they had drums
[32:19.000 --> 32:21.520]  of their own, air raid sirens.
[32:21.520 --> 32:25.840]  But in the 21st century there are silent weapons for quiet war.
[32:25.840 --> 32:30.600]  Pathogens added to the food and water, and to the lining of plastics that destroy our
[32:30.600 --> 32:31.600]  vitality.
[32:31.600 --> 32:35.520]  Turn off our hormones and accelerate our journey towards death.
[32:35.520 --> 32:38.600]  I personally counter this onslaught with Anthroplex.
[32:38.600 --> 32:46.960]  Anthroplex is designed with known organic concentrated herbs to create the basic foundation
[32:46.960 --> 32:50.600]  to normal metabolic activity inside the human body.
[32:50.600 --> 32:54.680]  Over why Anthroplex has turned so many heads today, it's time for us to take our bodies
[32:54.680 --> 33:21.800]  back in our own hands and it starts at inforwarslife.com with Anthroplex.
[33:43.560 --> 33:49.840]  I am really upset by what's going on and happening and it's normal to be like this.
[33:49.840 --> 34:01.320]  We've gotten in this trouble because everything is about conditioning us and preparing us
[34:01.320 --> 34:04.320]  to just accept things ten times worse.
[34:04.320 --> 34:07.720]  This is psychological warfare, it's public.
[34:07.720 --> 34:12.000]  Almost everything we talk about is actually admitted.
[34:12.000 --> 34:22.920]  They legalized two years ago the CIA engaged in domestic propaganda operations and you
[34:22.920 --> 34:28.320]  have to understand, folks, when you see them on the news saying your kids belong to the
[34:28.320 --> 34:35.160]  state or saying that it was German blonde haired blue eyed men that attacked women all
[34:35.160 --> 34:38.720]  over Germany, that is psychological warfare.
[34:38.720 --> 34:43.920]  Never meant to even know that's not true and just get in the mode of accepting that they
[34:43.920 --> 34:46.760]  lie to you.
[34:46.760 --> 34:50.720]  That's why Obama goes on the news and says you didn't build your business.
[34:50.720 --> 35:03.560]  Two plus two doesn't necessarily equal five.
[35:03.560 --> 35:04.560]  I'm an air special report.
[35:04.560 --> 35:06.880]  I'm actually too upset to be on air right now.
[35:06.880 --> 35:07.880]  Let me see some of the special reports.
[35:07.880 --> 35:09.720]  I may have to go off air today, actually.
[35:09.720 --> 35:10.720]  This is not an act.
[35:10.720 --> 35:11.720]  I can't be on air right now.
[35:11.720 --> 35:12.720]  This is just too big.
[35:12.720 --> 35:14.720]  We need to mourn for this country.
[35:14.720 --> 35:17.760]  This country is basically already in the cemetery and just even being on air and being a talk
[35:17.760 --> 35:21.440]  show host is not even proper at this point.
[35:21.440 --> 35:22.880]  This is not drama.
[35:22.880 --> 35:25.080]  I just can't do it anymore.
[35:25.080 --> 35:27.120]  We've got to do something more serious about this.
[35:27.120 --> 35:32.080]  The president has come out and said there's little difference between communism and capitalism.
[35:32.080 --> 35:36.960]  That's why they always have the anarchists that are big foundation funded with communist
[35:36.960 --> 35:40.600]  red flags saying we're not communist, we're anarchist.
[35:40.600 --> 35:43.840]  We just want the means of production quote given to the people.
[35:43.840 --> 35:48.520]  That means you can't have your own business, your own shop, your own garden, your own farm.
[35:48.520 --> 35:53.480]  It means slave masters have everyone as slaves and control the means of production to control
[35:53.480 --> 35:57.120]  you and you live in a prison.
[35:57.120 --> 35:58.640]  And everything with them is a lie.
[35:58.640 --> 36:00.520]  Just like they say there is no communism.
[36:00.520 --> 36:02.560]  There is no communist threat.
[36:02.560 --> 36:08.960]  Communism is dead, communism doesn't exist because the West is adopting it.
[36:08.960 --> 36:21.600]  The United States deployed communism.
[36:21.600 --> 36:24.080]  England deployed communism.
[36:24.080 --> 36:31.080]  The Rothschilds deployed communism in 1917 to Russia in the textbooks.
[36:31.080 --> 36:35.040]  They had congressional hearings about it.
[36:35.040 --> 36:39.680]  The CIA in 1949 put mouse a tongue in power.
[36:39.680 --> 36:49.720]  You ask why rich yuppie kids driving Jaguars and eating at fancy wine bars have malt tattoos?
[36:49.720 --> 36:55.000]  Because they understand they will be the ruling class when we work in the slave factories.
[36:55.000 --> 36:56.960]  A lot of them actually aren't dumb.
[36:56.960 --> 37:01.880]  They're evil vampires who actually look forward to stomping the brains out of better men and
[37:01.880 --> 37:02.880]  women.
[37:02.880 --> 37:06.800]  They want to dominate us and hurt us.
[37:06.800 --> 37:09.440]  And the police don't like them, but you know what?
[37:09.440 --> 37:12.760]  You work for them.
[37:12.760 --> 37:13.760]  Same thing for the military.
[37:13.760 --> 37:19.600]  Now I'm going to get into this and play the clips of Obama saying it here in a moment.
[37:19.600 --> 37:22.640]  I'm going to settle down, but I'm trying not to start yelling and screaming because it's
[37:22.640 --> 37:23.640]  not good for me.
[37:23.640 --> 37:25.040]  And then I've got a lot of work to do today.
[37:25.040 --> 37:32.520]  When I do that on air, it may be entertaining, but it's affecting me and I can't do it anymore.
[37:32.520 --> 37:33.520]  Okay?
[37:33.520 --> 37:36.640]  But let me explain something, folks.
[37:36.640 --> 37:37.640]  This is normal.
[37:37.640 --> 37:46.680]  When your president is lying to everybody and bringing in final phase propaganda, you're
[37:46.680 --> 37:47.680]  in trouble.
[37:47.680 --> 37:51.080]  They're not giving us comic book communism anymore.
[37:51.080 --> 37:56.820]  They're giving us the last level lie that communism will give you total milk and honey
[37:56.820 --> 38:01.280]  and is pure capitalism because everybody's going to sit around and see rich people owning
[38:01.280 --> 38:06.080]  it, but they're living in a slave pit and going to ask, how is this communism when you
[38:06.080 --> 38:10.720]  come into Cuba and turn the tens of millions of people into slaves with select corporations
[38:10.720 --> 38:14.280]  and companies?
[38:14.280 --> 38:18.080]  And all the Communist Party people cash in on that.
[38:18.080 --> 38:25.240]  And then Cuba, a hundred years from now, will be called communist when everybody goes there
[38:25.240 --> 38:30.720]  and a communist official is over the prostitutes that are forced to have sex with Western men
[38:30.720 --> 38:35.080]  at the casino and don't even get the money.
[38:35.080 --> 38:37.800]  It's such enslavement like Islam.
[38:37.800 --> 38:40.680]  It's so evil.
[38:40.680 --> 38:46.880]  And then we're sit there with these horrible, pig glow in the dark and their little black
[38:46.880 --> 38:52.920]  outfits with all this money with their executive parents running around teaching communism when
[38:52.920 --> 38:55.320]  they live in $10 million houses.
[38:55.320 --> 38:56.720]  I just hate these people.
[38:56.720 --> 38:58.000]  They're such criminals.
[38:58.000 --> 38:59.800]  They hate you and your family.
[38:59.800 --> 39:01.300]  They are.
[39:01.300 --> 39:04.880]  There are enemies people and I'm here raising the alarm.
[39:04.880 --> 39:05.880]  Okay.
[39:05.880 --> 39:06.880]  That's all I can say.
[39:06.880 --> 39:12.880]  I don't have words to be any stronger with you.
[39:12.880 --> 39:17.400]  I prayed to God every day to give me the words and the information to present to you the
[39:17.400 --> 39:22.040]  truth so you can see it and really get how much trouble we're in.
[39:22.040 --> 39:23.040]  We are going.
[39:23.040 --> 39:25.880]  They were everybody cynical and dumb and laughing and everything.
[39:25.880 --> 39:29.720]  That's all the sitcoms, all the cartoons, all the dramas, all the movies are about arrested
[39:29.720 --> 39:33.640]  development, be a fool, be an idiot, only talk about sports.
[39:33.640 --> 39:39.280]  If you're a nice guy, if you're a trendy, you go to brainwashing meetings about what
[39:39.280 --> 39:44.960]  language to use and how to behave and how to act, not because you're stupid, but because
[39:44.960 --> 39:51.520]  you are entering the upper class of controllers as an inner party member to learn how to suppress
[39:51.520 --> 39:54.120]  your fellow humans.
[39:54.120 --> 39:59.040]  That's what they teach at colleges, go to the higher PhD levels.
[39:59.040 --> 40:05.600]  It's all nanotech and chimeras and brainwashing and TV flicker rates in the psychology department.
[40:05.600 --> 40:11.040]  You go over to the public policy department and it's talks with Gruber and others of how
[40:11.040 --> 40:15.720]  to lie and how dumb people are and how you prey on them.
[40:15.720 --> 40:23.480]  You go to the next department and it's just all anti-human evil.
[40:23.480 --> 40:26.160]  Most of the professors at UT, I've been in there and I've looked at them and I've talked
[40:26.160 --> 40:31.440]  to them, they see me and they just give me this hateful mad scientist recluse look and
[40:31.440 --> 40:35.080]  you've heard some of them on air and they're like, you'll never stop us.
[40:35.080 --> 40:42.520]  They are villains, they are the Legion of Doom, they're coming for us, they're here.
[40:42.520 --> 40:48.400]  They're allied with every evil organization you can imagine in their unified hate of God,
[40:48.400 --> 40:53.800]  in their unified hate of the individual and I swear on the altar of God, I won't resist
[40:53.800 --> 40:58.840]  them until the end and I pray to God to unleash the spirit of liberty on the enemy, do not
[40:58.840 --> 41:05.000]  give the planet over to the satanic filth.
[41:05.000 --> 41:09.800]  I got to stop, I got to say kill 200 million people less century, God help us, they want
[41:09.800 --> 41:17.120]  to have their way with us now and we just can't do it.
[41:17.120 --> 41:28.680]  I'm just going to stay on here, I'm not going to, I'm not going to go to, oh God, I'm not
[41:28.680 --> 41:29.680]  going to go.
[41:29.680 --> 41:32.640]  You look at the eyes and the behavior of the communist Chinese leaders, they are the most
[41:32.640 --> 41:34.640]  evil people I have ever seen.
[41:34.640 --> 41:39.720]  They drip with satanic energy and then you look at their little goblin creature, their
[41:39.720 --> 41:48.440]  little mentally retarded hermit kingdom hereditary royal dictatorship that's communist and they're
[41:48.440 --> 41:49.600]  now entering the phase.
[41:49.600 --> 41:54.720]  We wear crowns, we're above the law, we live in giant armored compounds and have jet copters
[41:54.720 --> 42:00.640]  and jumbo jets and sex slaves and you work out in the fields 18 hours a day or in a factory
[42:00.640 --> 42:06.400]  for apple and if you complain we take you and we blow your head off or if we need organs
[42:06.400 --> 42:11.760]  we take you and put you like a chicken at a factory farm and wait till somebody with
[42:11.760 --> 42:16.200]  your blood type and your genetic type, they got it down to that now not just blood type
[42:16.200 --> 42:23.280]  needs those quote fresh organs and all these trendies that aren't in on this think that
[42:23.280 --> 42:32.080]  they're going to be safe and good in this new utopia because they're part of it.
[42:32.080 --> 42:37.040]  Let's put the meme up on screen before I play this Obama clip Obama there's little difference
[42:37.040 --> 42:44.200]  between communism and capitalism just take what works best from both that's right it
[42:44.200 --> 42:48.760]  works best in communism to have all these giant slave factories and force everybody off their
[42:48.760 --> 42:55.240]  land poor peasants whether it's Ukraine or Poland or Russia they show up to your tiny
[42:55.240 --> 43:02.160]  farm 20, 30 acres on average same thing in China and you're living in a little mud hut
[43:02.160 --> 43:07.280]  but you love it because your families live there of 10 generations and you're super
[43:07.280 --> 43:11.840]  happy little kids got a little stick pole catching fish for dinner and they're all happy and
[43:11.840 --> 43:16.000]  in March in March the troops and they just grab your kids never see them again they go
[43:16.000 --> 43:21.240]  this way we'll take your women I rape those every time and then just grab the men and
[43:21.240 --> 43:25.680]  go watch your skills we're taking you a thousand miles to the south you're going to work in
[43:25.680 --> 43:31.800]  a factory you're going to work in a commune farm and they're just big fat communists just
[43:31.800 --> 43:36.480]  eating food the high rail starving death they'll say just take a few out and shoot them that's
[43:36.480 --> 43:40.880]  the essence of the red terror teach them that their life is nothing you know live in the
[43:40.880 --> 43:49.760]  heaven enjoy and then after they've broken everyone for decades then they bring factories
[43:49.760 --> 43:54.800]  and say we're going to have a little bit of economic work with the South Koreans or with
[43:54.800 --> 43:58.800]  the Russians or with the Americans or whoever talking about China and they're bringing a
[43:58.800 --> 44:02.400]  factory and so only the best are going to get to go and work hard and do good and you'll
[44:02.400 --> 44:07.360]  move up then they use those few success stories to get everybody else to behave and line up
[44:07.360 --> 44:12.680]  to work in the factories and get trained and then suddenly you get nothing but it's okay
[44:12.680 --> 44:17.160]  because the communists say they love the people and Apple the most abuse of factory controllers
[44:17.160 --> 44:22.680]  they're liberal too they wear little gray suits and active feminine that's all camouflaged
[44:22.680 --> 44:27.840]  oh hi you want to see the new Apple stuff we're coming out with we're a liberal behind
[44:27.840 --> 44:34.960]  the scenes savage AI takeover Apple funding the launch of space bases where does the Mars
[44:34.960 --> 44:40.080]  mission ready I mean they're just move forward I want life extension now I gotta go out and
[44:40.080 --> 44:44.400]  give a speech to these animals I'm telling you I've been around high-powered people you
[44:44.400 --> 44:49.040]  think I act aggressive and high-powered this is exactly what it's like in the real world
[44:49.040 --> 44:57.200]  with powerful men you're just never supposed to really see what men actually act like
[44:57.200 --> 45:05.520]  obelisk sit around and they operate in the darkness in a cloak of liberal oh we love
[45:05.520 --> 45:11.680]  you oh we're gonna help you come closer to the nest come to the light little babies like
[45:11.680 --> 45:18.520]  a giant anglerfish well I've been over to their side I've seen it I've said it I've
[45:18.520 --> 45:25.520]  looked at it let me tell you pure death is waiting you think an old sick Nazi collaborator
[45:25.520 --> 45:30.200]  with all his evil overthrowing constant countries putting in the radical Muslims to butcher the
[45:30.200 --> 45:34.520]  innocent Muslims there are some really good Muslim people in groups out there those people
[45:34.520 --> 45:38.240]  are being targeted and you know why they're being targeted because they're good they don't
[45:38.240 --> 45:43.440]  have demonic looks in their eyes they love God they're not satanic and the enemy is coming
[45:43.440 --> 45:51.800]  for them and then when the globalist Muslims attack us we go and attack the innocent Muslims
[45:51.800 --> 45:58.960]  the people perish for lack of knowledge and so Obama sits up there people think this show
[45:58.960 --> 46:04.760]  is dark they think it's hateful sometimes I'm showing you what the enemy's really saying
[46:04.760 --> 46:12.680]  and thinking about you I'm telling you that's the good news is as scary as this is at least
[46:12.680 --> 46:19.480]  you now know and believe me what I'm telling you isn't my opinion it's a fact I said two
[46:19.480 --> 46:28.080]  days ago watch for them to announce that communism is the ultimate expression of capitalism because
[46:28.080 --> 46:34.600]  I've seen them do the formula in over 60 other countries and now they're saying hey live under
[46:34.600 --> 46:39.200]  communism but still have multinationals and big banks and capitalism we'll have a capitalist
[46:39.200 --> 46:43.760]  shop and we'll have a communist shop oh by the way you don't get a car or a house or
[46:43.760 --> 46:48.440]  air conditioning and you don't get to shop with that shop but they hide it in plain view
[46:48.440 --> 46:52.880]  see that's why the more powerful stuff I say the more the more hardcore stuff that I say
[46:52.880 --> 46:57.440]  the key things I say they have the winehouse run media matters and other White House run
[46:57.440 --> 47:03.640]  groups come out and put it up there like it's insane and crazy because they're scared of
[47:03.640 --> 47:09.520]  it they want to hide it in plain view like look at this stupidness look at it haha he
[47:09.520 --> 47:18.640]  said Obamacare doubles and triples prices and has death panels you see they're waging
[47:18.640 --> 47:23.360]  war on reality that's why they have the national feminist groups and the national green parties
[47:23.360 --> 47:29.440]  in Europe come out and say we apologize for the racism of Germany and we apologize for
[47:29.440 --> 47:37.320]  the rape of Muslim women by German and French men no known cases not happening not going
[47:37.320 --> 47:45.080]  on but in the news they apologize to invert that's why their symbol is a pentagram what
[47:45.080 --> 47:50.720]  is a what is a pentacle let's go to the esoteric okay but they tell you is the occult that
[47:50.720 --> 47:55.720]  just means hidden not satanic the pentate pentacle is nothing but the symbol of a human
[47:55.720 --> 48:00.040]  you've got the head you've got the arms you've got the legs and you're looking up you're
[48:00.040 --> 48:06.120]  going up just like a life room is a tree going up towards the sky what is death the peace
[48:06.120 --> 48:14.880]  symbol death death their symbol is death they're a death cult they are inverting life the pentagram
[48:14.880 --> 48:19.240]  they are not a life room they are a death room they're not a live tree what's a tree
[48:19.240 --> 48:27.080]  doing it dies its branches fall down to its sides they hide it all in your face and they
[48:27.080 --> 48:36.160]  think you're stupid they are the children of death all those that hate me Christ said
[48:36.160 --> 48:40.200]  love death and let me tell you something I didn't used to be a very strong Christian
[48:40.200 --> 48:44.680]  20 25 years ago I'll be honest with you but I've studied these people and I've been up
[48:44.680 --> 48:47.640]  against them and I've seen them let me tell you something folks they're getting their
[48:47.640 --> 48:54.840]  juice from something that ain't of this world and media matters and all of them can freak
[48:54.840 --> 49:00.880]  out about that I'm saying what supposedly 5 billion people of 7 and a half billion believe
[49:00.880 --> 49:12.680]  it's more like 6 billion see oh my gosh 90% national polls believe that Kennedy was killed
[49:12.680 --> 49:22.040]  by the CIA what cooks oh my gosh 6 plus billion people are more the vast majority of the humans
[49:22.040 --> 49:25.200]  on earth I mean atheists are even lower than that I don't know the numbers I'm just trying
[49:25.200 --> 49:29.800]  to be conservative I bet it's 7 billion people believe in a master creator of 7 and a half
[49:29.800 --> 49:37.560]  billion I bet there's not 500 million atheists as hard as they've tried but it's not these
[49:37.560 --> 49:43.480]  churches where you're gonna find God no it's in your heart it's in history it's in your
[49:43.480 --> 49:49.840]  gut and it's in the enemy's activities as they pray to their evil gods as they take
[49:49.840 --> 49:55.040]  pleasure in hurting innocent people as they overthrow prosperity and goodness and wholesomeness
[49:55.040 --> 50:02.160]  so they can mutilate and mutate and vandalize and squat on all that is good let's go out
[50:02.160 --> 50:06.120]  to break I haven't played the clip yet of Obama it's on info wars.com there's a little
[50:06.120 --> 50:11.600]  difference between communism and capitalism yeah when you're in Cuba or China in a slave
[50:11.600 --> 50:17.120]  factory owned by Apple I think there is a big difference the ultimate discrimination
[50:17.120 --> 50:24.160]  here's the clip you know so often in the past there's been a sharp division between left
[50:24.160 --> 50:31.600]  and right between capitalist and communist or socialist and especially in the Americas
[50:31.600 --> 50:41.000]  that's been a big debate right you know you're you're a capitalist Yankee dog and oh you know
[50:41.000 --> 50:48.920]  you're some you know crazy communists you know that's gonna take away everybody's property
[50:48.920 --> 50:55.640]  and I mean those are in interesting intellectual arguments but I think for your generation you
[50:55.640 --> 51:02.840]  should be practical and just choose from what works you don't have to worry about whether
[51:02.840 --> 51:10.360]  it neatly fits into socialist theory or capitalist theory you just decide what works and so you
[51:10.360 --> 51:18.000]  don't have to be rigid in saying it's it's either this or that you can say depending
[51:18.000 --> 51:25.200]  on the problem you're trying to solve depending on the social issues that you're trying to
[51:25.200 --> 51:35.160]  address what works and and I think that what you'll find is that the most successful societies
[51:35.160 --> 51:40.720]  the most successful economies are ones that are rooted in a market-based system oh my
[51:40.720 --> 51:50.720]  gosh also recognize that a market does not work by itself it has to have a social and
[51:50.720 --> 51:56.720]  moral and ethical and community a directorship that leads off of it yeah and there has to
[51:56.720 --> 52:05.080]  be inclusion otherwise it's not stable like communist China and Cuba and and and it's
[52:05.080 --> 52:09.840]  up to you as you as you for the winners or whether you're in business or in academia
[52:09.840 --> 52:16.800]  or in the nonprofit sector whatever you're doing to create new forms that are adapted
[52:16.800 --> 52:24.920]  to the new conditions that we live in today I could teach a eight-year college course
[52:24.920 --> 52:29.920]  on that speech and if you understood that you would understand everything the globalist
[52:29.920 --> 52:35.880]  in their own writings at the Carnegie Endowment in the 30s and these are published these came
[52:35.880 --> 52:39.800]  out in the congressional hearings and Frank Church's committee and others that Anthony
[52:39.800 --> 52:47.520]  Sutton was the key congressional scholar really leading those events and he wrote the books
[52:47.520 --> 52:50.960]  about Wall Street and the Rise of the Bolsheviks Wall Street and the Rise of Hitler that's
[52:50.960 --> 52:58.720]  all well known today that was secret when Congress declassified in the 60s and 70s and
[52:58.720 --> 53:03.120]  people like Barry Goldwater and others had tears in their eyes when they read it as it
[53:03.120 --> 53:12.560]  was being declassified he's up there what did Carnegie Endowment say and the Ford Foundation
[53:12.560 --> 53:17.280]  later we're going to merge the United States with communism and Europe first we're going
[53:17.280 --> 53:21.680]  to build up communism as a threat let it take over large areas we'll give it the funds the
[53:21.680 --> 53:25.640]  money the weapons we'll act like we're opposing it Carol quickly wrote about this and tragedy
[53:25.640 --> 53:29.520]  and hope as well go read it for all you pseudo intellectuals that are new listeners think
[53:29.520 --> 53:33.960]  this is funny this is directly from the guy that wrote an 1100 page book for the State
[53:33.960 --> 53:39.720]  Department the CIA because in the early 1960s they said listen our PhDs are coming in they
[53:39.720 --> 53:44.280]  don't understand we're anti-fascist anti-communist but we actually want to put communist and fascist
[53:44.280 --> 53:52.280]  in and dictators are we bad guys and quickly wrote an 1100 page book tragedy and hope explaining
[53:52.280 --> 53:59.840]  we sell it in 4store.com by the way explaining to them it was meant to be restricted Patriot
[53:59.840 --> 54:03.960]  groups got it and published it no matter what quickly wanted and they had the government
[54:03.960 --> 54:08.560]  had to back off because it was actually funded by the government so it's available today
[54:08.560 --> 54:13.600]  the John Burt society and others got it out back then obviously it was undercover so they
[54:13.600 --> 54:18.440]  never wanted the credit quiet professionals let's just say quiet professionals smuggle
[54:18.440 --> 54:23.600]  the Death Star plans out and then no one even cares no one even buys it we have death star
[54:23.600 --> 54:28.360]  blueprints and now we're under it getting hit by it it was one thing while they were
[54:28.360 --> 54:34.360]  building the stinking thing and it was ravaging other countries now it's here and we are under
[54:34.360 --> 54:42.600]  its tracking targeting system it's warming up it's clear to fire you better learn about
[54:42.600 --> 54:49.440]  it right now I like some socialist things I like some communist things I like some free
[54:49.440 --> 54:55.400]  market things that's what they teach in every college class doesn't matter if it's if it's
[54:55.400 --> 54:58.720]  foreign language doesn't matter if it's science doesn't matter if it's psychology they're
[54:58.720 --> 55:02.840]  all told us to come in and just drop that in you know if you want tenor tenure yeah
[55:02.840 --> 55:07.280]  you know there's a lot of good stuff about communism it's had some problems capitalism
[55:07.280 --> 55:10.840]  has got some good stuff too just to get your eye oh yeah communism it's kind of like it's
[55:10.840 --> 55:14.720]  all right to stick your arm in there with that cobra cobras can be mean but they can
[55:14.720 --> 55:21.600]  also be nice sometimes you know cobras teddy bears cobra capitalism it's kind of like teddy
[55:21.600 --> 55:26.600]  bears a little bit of kind of nice free market but it's got some problems in cobras ten foot
[55:26.600 --> 55:30.360]  king cobra no big deal oh how you doing let's just stick your arm right in there it's going
[55:30.360 --> 55:38.800]  to take good care of you and so you sit there and you listen to him just real oh he's just
[55:38.800 --> 55:48.600]  trying to amblin over like it's non-threatening he kind of dumbs his speech down and just
[55:48.600 --> 55:54.880]  to sound non-threatening oh by the way uh free markets do work for best but when they're
[55:54.880 --> 55:59.480]  what they need to work with a communist country and what I'm really saying is the globalists
[55:59.480 --> 56:03.320]  are above the law and run the multinational grid of the new world cashless society and
[56:03.320 --> 56:08.040]  then we'll have you under communism total slaves because you can't have cars in air conditioning
[56:08.040 --> 56:11.680]  we want you totally under our control we're phasing you out of eugenics that's the next
[56:11.680 --> 56:15.640]  phase the final goal of collectivism is to get you dependent turn off your life force
[56:15.640 --> 56:19.280]  your survival instinct so we can then just start killing you in mass because wars and
[56:19.280 --> 56:24.280]  stuff aren't enough so we need you to be under communism but square that with all these rich
[56:24.280 --> 56:29.080]  people flying around on jumbo jets from google and you know the saudi royalty and closing
[56:29.080 --> 56:36.200]  down ten miles of beach when the saudi royalty comes to france yeah yeah you gotta tweak
[56:36.200 --> 56:41.000]  it and there's no rules except the ones we make and there's no real ideology just black
[56:41.000 --> 56:47.680]  uniform police cameras total surveillance forced medical systems the family under attack
[56:47.680 --> 56:54.520]  massive debt dumbing down in education except for select elite schools for the children
[56:54.520 --> 56:59.720]  of the ruling class and you look at tv today it's the kids of the bushes and the clintons
[56:59.720 --> 57:04.480]  and all the rest of them on the shows and the governor's brother and this and that it's
[57:04.480 --> 57:10.440]  the ruling class they all know what they're doing they hate us they have clean vaccines
[57:10.440 --> 57:16.240]  they give us poison vaccines that's mainstream german newspapers just look at what they've
[57:16.240 --> 57:20.800]  done to us look at what they think about us and they want that means of production that's
[57:20.800 --> 57:23.920]  why they're banned and eliminate stands it's why they're banning the little local markets
[57:23.920 --> 57:27.920]  is why they're targeting the little guy with high taxes because control the means of production
[57:27.920 --> 57:32.840]  is total enslavement that's why you gotta buy the books the videos the t-shirts and info
[57:32.840 --> 57:37.640]  or store dot com to fund us while we still have a small piece of free market choice left
[57:37.640 --> 57:43.000]  it's so powerful that if we get that idea out to people it will overthrow the enemy
[57:43.000 --> 57:49.360]  by choice that's what they gotta bring in total tyranny because people will just by choice
[57:49.360 --> 57:54.000]  not even being intellectual will gravitate towards freedom so every bit of it has to
[57:54.000 --> 57:58.880]  be expunged when the big night comes in there can be no light no stars no moon no nothing
[57:58.880 --> 58:05.320]  everyone will go to the fire of liberty the promethean flame of choice so they've got opposed
[58:05.320 --> 58:11.520]  as the light even as they turn the lights off literally and figuratively in chelchescu's
[58:11.520 --> 58:19.000]  romania only his government district had light and food and caviar and the women and chelchescu
[58:19.000 --> 58:22.320]  had power for everybody and his general staff said sir you're making him mad and he goes
[58:22.320 --> 58:27.760]  i want them to see that only we have the light through us they will see us like heaven and
[58:27.760 --> 58:31.880]  will think that we are invincible no that's your satanic impulse it made them rip you

[59:46.760 --> 59:58.920]  two five three three one three nine you're listening to the alex jones show
[1:00:02.680 --> 1:00:09.240]  from his central texas command center deep behind enemy lines the information war continues
[1:00:09.240 --> 1:00:20.200]  it's alex jones and the gcn radio network
[1:00:29.080 --> 1:00:30.920]  i've said it before and i'll say it again
[1:00:35.000 --> 1:00:38.760]  this is not a boss hog tyranny taken over that just wants to run things and
[1:00:38.760 --> 1:00:42.920]  wants to have big fat you know cows and pigs on the plantation and only butcher them and slaughter
[1:00:42.920 --> 1:00:51.720]  them every once in a while this is not a prosperity based uh tyranny bloom those have happened before
[1:00:52.600 --> 1:00:57.400]  they always are extremely successful for a while until the grandson or the great grandson or the
[1:00:57.400 --> 1:01:03.720]  great granddaughter gets control of whatever some super emperor set up and built because they wanted
[1:01:03.720 --> 1:01:09.960]  libraries and public works and huge statues and then breeding programs and the population and
[1:01:11.480 --> 1:01:18.040]  stoicism being taught honor being taught those have only come along a few times they always
[1:01:18.040 --> 1:01:23.560]  take over the known world in about 50 years and then the rot and the corruption sets in and
[1:01:24.920 --> 1:01:28.920]  the decadence of the elites they don't like seeing some lower level person with a wife
[1:01:28.920 --> 1:01:34.600]  better looking than theirs they don't like seeing a farmer what do you mean there's all these farmers
[1:01:34.600 --> 1:01:39.880]  that you know that my grandfather gave huge pieces of land to the now we have a grain surplus when
[1:01:39.880 --> 1:01:44.920]  we had to import our grain just 100 years ago you know what i'm just going to take those over
[1:01:45.960 --> 1:01:51.080]  and make them be my slaves and then the production plummets this is the nature of evil
[1:01:53.560 --> 1:01:56.600]  and we put a quick meme out today the crew did it without me even telling them
[1:01:56.600 --> 1:02:02.440]  that's a great crew right there if i just had three times as many people just as smart and good
[1:02:02.440 --> 1:02:05.240]  taking years to get a crew this good we've had some great crews but this is the best
[1:02:06.680 --> 1:02:10.520]  and of course it's the best as the evil comes in like a flood that's what
[1:02:10.520 --> 1:02:11.800]  that's how the universe works
[1:02:15.320 --> 1:02:20.120]  i guess i mentioned to me but the point is they did a great job showing there's little difference
[1:02:20.120 --> 1:02:24.920]  between communism and capitalism and then we show communism totally empty store shelves
[1:02:24.920 --> 1:02:27.560]  and capitalism totally full shelves
[1:02:31.320 --> 1:02:32.840]  yeah why don't we also just show
[1:02:35.880 --> 1:02:40.200]  a baseball game or something with a bunch of fat americans it does have a side effect
[1:02:40.760 --> 1:02:46.040]  and then showed north korea starving north koreans you know we've had probably 30 contest
[1:02:47.080 --> 1:02:50.760]  or more and i paid out on every one of them except one
[1:02:50.760 --> 1:02:56.680]  and that's because i was out of town taking care of business a few weeks ago and in town
[1:02:56.680 --> 1:03:00.520]  and i announced one and then i didn't really direct anybody to be over it and i never saw
[1:03:00.520 --> 1:03:04.600]  the submissions on the website i could never pick a winner i even forget which one that was
[1:03:05.240 --> 1:03:09.240]  um i mean i've had a hundred thousand dollar contest but i like to do these flash tests
[1:03:09.240 --> 1:03:11.960]  they're only like a week long and then like a thousand dollars just to make it fun and then
[1:03:11.960 --> 1:03:16.760]  tens of millions get reached but i'm going to do a contest and we're going to go back and reverse
[1:03:16.760 --> 1:03:21.240]  engineer what that last contest was and find those entries put them on the site and pay that one out
[1:03:21.880 --> 1:03:27.160]  that's a thousand because i've got to be true to my word because even if i get lazy and don't do it
[1:03:27.160 --> 1:03:31.320]  not out of doing it on purpose but just have a laziness it'll become a virus that destroys us
[1:03:32.120 --> 1:03:39.480]  but we really do need to have a contest for a meme about obama saying communism and capitalism
[1:03:39.480 --> 1:03:45.720]  are basically the same thing of course there's little difference between communism and capitalism
[1:03:45.720 --> 1:03:50.120]  but you know what why should i even have a contest it almost insults the great people out there
[1:03:50.680 --> 1:03:54.040]  i just like to have a prize at the end of it because it makes it fun it's free market
[1:03:54.760 --> 1:03:58.200]  just an added goody but how about defend what's left of your free market
[1:03:59.320 --> 1:04:03.960]  and we'll just see what the award is next friday we may just say who i think the winner is or it
[1:04:03.960 --> 1:04:09.160]  might be fifty thousand dollars because that's really what capitalism and free market is
[1:04:09.160 --> 1:04:14.920]  you don't know the outcome that's what makes it so dynamic oh that's even better maybe you
[1:04:14.920 --> 1:04:22.200]  just promote freedom maybe there is no price or maybe there's 10 000 or 50 000 i don't really have
[1:04:22.200 --> 1:04:29.320]  the money to do that not over four five thousand dollars but then i will i sure wish i could i sure
[1:04:29.320 --> 1:04:34.280]  wish i had billions to fight these enemies i could just absolutely tear the ground up underneath them
[1:04:34.280 --> 1:04:40.120]  and just smash them into a pile of rubble with god's help i know the enemy i know how to defeat
[1:04:40.120 --> 1:04:44.600]  the enemy and i know you know how to defeat the enemy but people need to pay a very close
[1:04:44.600 --> 1:04:51.480]  attention to this operation because i'll tell you right now info wars is studied not just by the
[1:04:51.480 --> 1:04:56.040]  pentagon but by other war fighting laboratories around the world as the cutting edge of information
[1:04:56.040 --> 1:05:01.800]  warfare well the secret boys is i tell the truth i've got a lot of things on my plate
[1:05:03.480 --> 1:05:12.840]  but my top priority is to defeat isil and to eliminate the scourge of and indeed obama
[1:05:12.840 --> 1:05:19.080]  has been very busy this week playing dominoes doing the wave at a baseball game and dancing the tango
[1:05:19.080 --> 1:05:24.360]  oh and rewriting history by telling a group of argentinians that there is a little difference
[1:05:24.360 --> 1:05:30.200]  between communism and capitalism say what obama went on to praise cuba's socialist system under
[1:05:30.200 --> 1:05:35.560]  dictator raul castro he touted the country's free access to basic education and health care
[1:05:35.560 --> 1:05:40.920]  although he acknowledged that havana itself looks like it did in the 1950s because the economy
[1:05:40.920 --> 1:05:46.280]  is not working indeed that's one of the great achievements of capitalism innovation if you
[1:05:46.280 --> 1:05:51.560]  want to school your friends once and for all on the difference between communism and capitalism
[1:05:51.560 --> 1:05:56.840]  visit the alex shone's youtube channel and share the video why capitalism is great
[1:05:56.840 --> 1:06:01.880]  leon macadoo reporting for info wars dot com you're investing in your health and supporting

[1:06:11.400 --> 1:06:18.520]  pharmacists chemists doctors researchers scientists and the answer is clear iodine is key is paramount
[1:06:18.520 --> 1:06:23.720]  and there's still so much new information coming out that we simply can't even keep up with it in
[1:06:23.720 --> 1:06:29.720]  our quest for the purest iodine we drill down more than 7000 feet to gather these purple blue
[1:06:29.720 --> 1:06:35.480]  crystals to extract the ultra pure iodine on top of that we also screen our iodine for radiation
[1:06:35.480 --> 1:06:41.080]  before bottling it is the purest cleanest strongest out there quite frankly i'm flattered that with the
[1:06:41.080 --> 1:06:46.440]  launch of survival shield nason iodine that major brands and major companies have been knocking down
[1:06:46.440 --> 1:06:51.000]  our doors to get our formula and that they have been unable to come up with anything even close to
[1:06:51.000 --> 1:06:58.600]  what we have it is exclusive to info wars life dot com and the info wars life family of incredible
[1:06:58.600 --> 1:07:05.640]  products brain force it's completely different try a bottle of it rob do designs us you worked i
[1:07:05.640 --> 1:07:10.600]  guess like 20 plus hours tell us what brain force i've been working all day i took a couple hours
[1:07:10.600 --> 1:07:16.440]  off coaching basketball i get in here at 8 30 i was kind of run down you know i just didn't feel
[1:07:16.440 --> 1:07:20.280]  like i was going to make it and i really want to do a good job on the interview i got my bottle
[1:07:20.280 --> 1:07:24.840]  of brain force right there i popped two of them and about 20 minutes later it's like bing everything
[1:07:24.840 --> 1:07:30.760]  just kind of clears up got four and a half stars people really love it read about it find out why
[1:07:30.760 --> 1:07:35.800]  third party nutraceutical sites give it such high praise because it really does have the best
[1:07:35.800 --> 1:07:40.440]  organic based systems that will blow your socks off i haven't pulled it all night or like that in a
[1:07:40.440 --> 1:07:45.080]  while but i probably could not have done it without brain force i went home about 645 this morning
[1:07:45.640 --> 1:07:50.440]  took three hours of sleep got up took two more brain force and came in you will find a brain
[1:07:50.440 --> 1:07:58.120]  force and other game changing products at info wars life dot com or call 888-253-3139
[1:08:06.360 --> 1:08:12.360]  in the councils of government we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence
[1:08:12.360 --> 1:08:19.080]  whether sought or unsought by the military industrial context in vallisexis three shots
[1:08:19.080 --> 1:08:24.680]  were fired at president kennedy's motorcade in downtown dallas the first report to say that
[1:08:24.680 --> 1:08:32.920]  president kennedy has been seriously wounded by the shooting it is a big idea a new order
[1:08:36.280 --> 1:08:41.000]  it was almost as if it were a planned impulse it just pancakes
[1:08:41.000 --> 1:08:52.840]  either you were with us or you were with the terrorists
[1:09:00.280 --> 1:09:05.240]  but i also believe a lot of gun owners would agree that ak-47s belong in the hands of soldiers not
[1:09:05.240 --> 1:09:14.120]  the hands of criminals guns will be taken no one will be able to be off we'll take all of them
[1:09:14.120 --> 1:09:18.920]  for many of the police and guard troops it is an uncomfortable job to do this in an american city
[1:09:18.920 --> 1:09:24.040]  global governance at last is it one world the central bank is in charge but aren't we all
[1:09:24.040 --> 1:09:30.680]  just living and dying for what the central banks do and for me give me liberty or give me death
[1:09:30.680 --> 1:09:37.800]  life from the info wars dot com studios it's alex jones
[1:09:39.800 --> 1:09:43.720]  ladies and gentlemen thank you so much for joining us we're well into the second hour now
[1:09:43.720 --> 1:09:47.560]  we're gonna have a really interesting discussion not a debate because i like both men and respect
[1:09:47.560 --> 1:09:53.400]  both men and both men have been very very accurate on say 95 of what they have been breaking down
[1:09:53.400 --> 1:10:01.800]  on uh but uh harry dent and of course uh peter schiffer gonna be on the full third hour today
[1:10:01.800 --> 1:10:06.760]  we'll also take some calls in the second half of that and then of course in the fourth hour
[1:10:06.760 --> 1:10:12.920]  we've got one of our great crew running that operation jacari jackson so look forward to that
[1:10:17.000 --> 1:10:19.640]  i'll tell you why i'm so upset if you listen to the last hour
[1:10:19.640 --> 1:10:27.160]  it's because our worst case analysis of the globalist program has just been totally confirmed
[1:10:27.160 --> 1:10:31.960]  over and over again and in fact the new world order takeover operation appears to be even
[1:10:31.960 --> 1:10:37.480]  worse than our worst analysis it's far worse than we even thought
[1:10:37.480 --> 1:10:48.680]  so all i can say is if you want to try to stop something
[1:10:51.880 --> 1:10:58.440]  six times bigger no be more than that let me see globalist directed fascist and communist
[1:10:58.440 --> 1:11:04.440]  operations probably killed let's be conservative 260 million people non-military combatants in
[1:11:04.440 --> 1:11:11.720]  the 20th century that's a university of hawaii demography study and it integrates them with
[1:11:11.720 --> 1:11:16.040]  some others that show you the higher numbers i'd have the professor on but he is um he's he's a
[1:11:16.040 --> 1:11:21.400]  listener um he's aware of our work afterwards uh tried to get him on but he is uh hearing impaired
[1:11:21.400 --> 1:11:34.840]  to use the uh little correct term death but um it's 262 million non-military combatants non-military
[1:11:34.840 --> 1:11:40.360]  or combatants killed so minimum men and children that weren't fighting by communist mainly and
[1:11:40.360 --> 1:11:46.920]  then fascists are about 60 something of it and i've studied the entire globalist operation
[1:11:46.920 --> 1:11:51.160]  they actually state their plan once they get in full control and control the means of food
[1:11:51.160 --> 1:11:57.240]  and production they're going to turn loose automated robot systems to where we're completely
[1:11:57.240 --> 1:12:05.240]  obsolete and then dictate the terms of surrender of the human community incrementally won't be an
[1:12:05.240 --> 1:12:10.760]  announced surrender into social engineering forced medical procedures sterilization
[1:12:10.760 --> 1:12:24.680]  drugging thx 1138 to basically drug us but also positronically electronically prepare us for the
[1:12:24.680 --> 1:12:37.000]  next phase that will be a mass extermination program and it won't be people will willfully go
[1:12:37.000 --> 1:12:42.920]  and be euthanized now a lot of people are going to die in the first waves of biological and chemical
[1:12:42.920 --> 1:12:46.280]  releases they'll claim terrorists are running and a lot of times they'll wind up real terrorists
[1:12:46.280 --> 1:12:53.720]  and actually let them do it and then we'll go under a super medical slash fascist slash communist
[1:12:53.720 --> 1:13:03.080]  on the grassroots economically system that we will then have to basically submit to just to live
[1:13:03.080 --> 1:13:13.080]  in the armored technological reservations which are really just big prisons in the globalist
[1:13:13.080 --> 1:13:18.200]  own words and then they will have separate reservations in their own words generally in
[1:13:18.200 --> 1:13:27.000]  remote rural beautiful pastoral redoubts and the enemy has been building a lot more of these
[1:13:27.000 --> 1:13:31.880]  preparing and spending a lot of their time in them now and you see a lot of preparations going from
[1:13:34.200 --> 1:13:41.560]  deliberate to intense to hurried to frenzied to hysterical the enemies like a fire ant hill
[1:13:41.560 --> 1:13:48.440]  that's been knocked over just scrambling around insanely but also with a little chuckle in their
[1:13:49.160 --> 1:13:54.120]  voice and a little skip in their walk and a little twinkle in their eye though so it's a great
[1:13:54.120 --> 1:14:03.400]  work they're doing it's a pretty spectacular actually and they even know they're going to get
[1:14:03.400 --> 1:14:09.080]  destroyed most of them by their masters but they don't care it's just a they enjoy it they just want
[1:14:09.080 --> 1:14:15.240]  to be on the team i realize that you're not going to convince them to stop or not be part of it
[1:14:15.240 --> 1:14:22.760]  they like it it's good to be on a team everything is awesome when you're part of a team everything
[1:14:22.760 --> 1:14:30.440]  is awesome it's really awesome isn't it man really really great what you guys did to people to
[1:14:30.440 --> 1:14:35.960]  humanity really really great how you dumbed everybody down and taught us to hate our children
[1:14:35.960 --> 1:14:40.600]  and taught us to hate our unborn and taught us all how to fight with each other and hate each other
[1:14:40.600 --> 1:14:45.640]  and took our natural natural tribalism that was there for us to survive 10 000 years ago but
[1:14:45.640 --> 1:14:50.120]  destroying us now and claim you were going to end it when all you did was make it third dimensional
[1:14:50.120 --> 1:14:56.840]  and create thousands of new ways for us to hate each other thanks a lot got you people really are
[1:14:56.840 --> 1:15:04.280]  horrible and you know you're horrible that's why you hate us that aren't perfect but we love life
[1:15:04.280 --> 1:15:11.800]  and god and love other successful people and love beauty and you just can't exist with us around can
[1:15:11.800 --> 1:15:21.880]  you and you've taken our kindness for weakness but you know what i guess it is weakness
[1:15:25.960 --> 1:15:28.920]  because you take somebody at birth and you put them into this artificial system
[1:15:30.840 --> 1:15:37.000]  and you wage war against logic and you ridicule people that are good and you create false systems
[1:15:37.000 --> 1:15:42.120]  and false heroes people never had a chance to even get off the ground
[1:15:45.560 --> 1:15:53.080]  humanity is being aborted on the launchpad spaceship earth is there ready
[1:15:55.560 --> 1:16:00.920]  and the elite don't believe that humanity can have access to all this incredible technology
[1:16:00.920 --> 1:16:05.320]  and life extension and everything else they've just got a glimpse of it and are just
[1:16:05.320 --> 1:16:13.160]  just fantastically odd and are just seeing us as a big barbarous mass of people that has
[1:16:13.160 --> 1:16:20.840]  to be controlled and managed and called and done away with because they're the guardians of all of
[1:16:20.840 --> 1:16:29.880]  all the neat stuff and what they've discovered no you've stolen it you claim you're collectivist
[1:16:29.880 --> 1:16:36.520]  but you collectivize the ideas steal them compartmentalize them for yourself and then tell you the
[1:16:36.520 --> 1:16:41.720]  public that you are the great visionaries bringing us into the one world order to stop
[1:16:42.360 --> 1:16:48.840]  world war and to stop famine and then you burrow into your own imf world bank admissions you are the
[1:16:48.840 --> 1:16:57.880]  main engines the drivers the captains at the wheel the captains at the helm who ride out as defenders
[1:16:57.880 --> 1:17:08.040]  of the realm but you're not defending the realm of humanity you're defending this sick idea this realm
[1:17:08.040 --> 1:17:17.240]  you're building where you merge with all the technology and become as gods
[1:17:21.960 --> 1:17:27.560]  and imagine they have white house run publications that come out when i talk about this and do big
[1:17:27.560 --> 1:17:33.160]  articles on it and go look how discredited and nuts he is because they're they're hoping that
[1:17:33.160 --> 1:17:39.400]  everybody looks at that and goes oh this is crazy hiding the the black arrow that would take down
[1:17:39.400 --> 1:17:56.280]  the dragon hiding the spear of destiny knowing the enemy's plan these are the big secrets
[1:17:56.280 --> 1:18:01.720]  make no mistake and this is what they don't want you to know
[1:18:05.240 --> 1:18:08.520]  are you going to let these people steal your destiny and your children's destiny from you
[1:18:08.520 --> 1:18:13.080]  are you really going to let the television and that false plastic culture dictate who you are
[1:18:14.760 --> 1:18:19.800]  get back with your family get back into the dirt go camping pray to god get on your knees
[1:18:19.800 --> 1:18:29.160]  fast do whatever you do to get yourself out of this world out of this false system and into the
[1:18:29.160 --> 1:18:35.080]  real world and realize that this is the great animating contest of liberty
[1:18:38.280 --> 1:18:44.760]  to have president obama come out and say that capitalism and communism that there's
[1:18:44.760 --> 1:18:50.040]  quote little difference between them we're gonna play the video next segment just played it earlier last
[1:18:50.040 --> 1:18:55.400]  hour is so huge because they're entering the final phase of world government with multinational
[1:18:55.400 --> 1:19:01.320]  multi trillion dollar companies less than a hundred of them now really only five or six total
[1:19:01.320 --> 1:19:07.880]  megabanks openly announcing planetary government openly announcing their tax exempt with diplomatic
[1:19:07.880 --> 1:19:12.200]  immunity and above the law and saying we're going to bring communism into the nation states
[1:19:12.200 --> 1:19:18.840]  and that multinational quote capitalism it's really not capitalism it's globalist fascism
[1:19:18.840 --> 1:19:25.240]  coupled with communism is the dream economy now that's been in their textbooks for a long time
[1:19:25.880 --> 1:19:29.960]  and i told you hundreds of times i told you yesterday on the day before
[1:19:33.000 --> 1:19:39.720]  that when they make that announcement in america they're getting ready to implode the economy
[1:19:39.720 --> 1:19:47.000]  and bring in the new economy that is a quote managed economy by the global fascist allied
[1:19:47.000 --> 1:19:53.000]  with socialist and communist in the client nation and then occasionally give you fake choice they'll
[1:19:53.000 --> 1:19:58.280]  flip it to fascist but it'll still be multinationals outside with the tentacle into the nation state
[1:19:58.280 --> 1:20:04.440]  controlling are you worried about how dangerous the world has become in these days of terrorist

[1:24:43.480 --> 1:24:47.960]  avert it and change it like telling someone your house is on fire you know when you drive by their
[1:24:47.960 --> 1:24:52.440]  house and it's your neighbor you call them hey your house is on fire that's not a fear mongering event
[1:24:54.040 --> 1:24:59.160]  and the elites themselves are digging in while throwing all the gas they can on the fire
[1:24:59.160 --> 1:25:09.480]  there communists killed around 200 million people in the 20th century and to have our president
[1:25:11.880 --> 1:25:13.880]  going around the world promoting communism
[1:25:17.320 --> 1:25:23.000]  when i got up at about six a.m and saw paul watson's article it was a punch in the stomach even
[1:25:23.000 --> 1:25:28.200]  though i knew it even though yesterday i said when they start saying communism and capitalism
[1:25:28.200 --> 1:25:34.040]  work together look out and sure enough i got up and i saw it
[1:25:36.440 --> 1:25:39.000]  and people say well are you surprised you know what
[1:25:44.360 --> 1:25:47.720]  it's one thing to be in the wrong neighborhood people say hey you better not go in that neighborhood
[1:25:47.720 --> 1:25:50.680]  people get mugged there and it's another thing to walk around a corner and somebody
[1:25:50.680 --> 1:25:57.800]  has a big knife out and says i'm gonna kill you if you don't give me your wallet
[1:25:58.680 --> 1:26:04.360]  see we're now at the moment where it's happening and what this signifies in a timeline they've
[1:26:04.360 --> 1:26:11.400]  run in countless other countries is just nightmarish i felt really bad things coming we've seen it
[1:26:11.400 --> 1:26:18.360]  intellectually i discussed it the last year now my gut level instinct is beyond anything
[1:26:18.360 --> 1:26:22.120]  it's ever been and it was the worst ever last week and i know people are feeling the same thing out
[1:26:22.120 --> 1:26:27.720]  there something big is about to happen i i think they're about to launch some giant war
[1:26:28.680 --> 1:26:33.240]  mega economic collapse the climate's perfect for it what do you think
[1:26:35.480 --> 1:26:37.240]  is going on and coming down
[1:26:40.280 --> 1:26:43.400]  i mean obviously we reach out to the general public and try to wake them up
[1:26:43.400 --> 1:26:49.320]  it is a moral humanity an informed involved humanity that's going to save
[1:26:50.520 --> 1:26:53.800]  the situation i mean that's just i mean that's what the bible says it's common sense it's
[1:26:53.800 --> 1:26:58.520]  historical we have become immoral whether you believe the bible or not we don't have any compass
[1:26:58.520 --> 1:27:03.880]  now other than hollywood and wall street and the globalists who are really evil anti-human people
[1:27:05.800 --> 1:27:11.880]  and as i told you cuba is such a scandal it's worse than classic first stage second stage
[1:27:11.880 --> 1:27:16.680]  communism because in third stage it's a management system where you've got multi generations
[1:27:16.680 --> 1:27:21.240]  brainwashed into collectivism not knowing how to take care of themselves but knowing how to work
[1:27:21.240 --> 1:27:29.000]  and follow orders about to now have a bunch of factories moved there and if you think we've
[1:27:29.000 --> 1:27:37.400]  lost jobs to mexico and india and china get ready for cuba and then it's praise because it's a
[1:27:37.400 --> 1:27:43.240]  black guy who's liberal and is on espn and oh look they're dragging those people away ha ha ha
[1:27:43.240 --> 1:27:48.760]  on espn it's like a dark satire science fiction movie
[1:27:52.520 --> 1:27:55.960]  so they're already building new factories there the first time in 50 years
[1:27:57.800 --> 1:28:02.360]  alabama-based company cleaver llc is to build tractors there
[1:28:02.360 --> 1:28:09.720]  isn't that just special people go oh it'll help the cubans no it's the managed one party state
[1:28:10.600 --> 1:28:12.760]  system where it's communist
[1:28:15.560 --> 1:28:16.920]  it's communist
[1:28:20.520 --> 1:28:25.240]  but multinational billionaires make all the money off of it there's another name for it it's called
[1:28:25.240 --> 1:28:33.080]  slavery and that's really all these isms are true free market has its problems because it makes
[1:28:33.080 --> 1:28:38.040]  everybody so decadent and somebody has so many choices and so wealthy that you become decadent
[1:28:38.040 --> 1:28:43.000]  and then your kids become spoiled and then they want power and then parties come in and corrupt
[1:28:43.000 --> 1:28:51.800]  gangs form and they say we don't produce things we rob all the wealth and that's what they're doing
[1:28:51.800 --> 1:28:58.840]  they want the power and the thrill of dominating the producers they want to own us they want to
[1:28:58.840 --> 1:29:02.840]  run somebody you ever notice how somebody had never done anything in their life wants to tell
[1:29:02.840 --> 1:29:07.400]  everybody what to do you ever see like a 17-year-old son or daughter that's been spoiled and they'll
[1:29:07.400 --> 1:29:11.080]  kind of boss their parents around about what car they should get or what vacation they should have
[1:29:11.080 --> 1:29:15.560]  and they know everything i remember when i was about 18 years old and moved out of the house
[1:29:15.560 --> 1:29:19.160]  i was a pretty good son but my parents had moved and they were getting new carpets and stuff and
[1:29:19.160 --> 1:29:22.840]  i was like i don't like that car i don't like your house looks i don't know you shouldn't go here
[1:29:22.840 --> 1:29:28.840]  before i had my own big life boy i sure knew how to run their life let me tell you
[1:29:31.240 --> 1:29:38.120]  and that's the problem is every control freak every sicko every loon every despot every would be
[1:29:38.120 --> 1:29:43.800]  thug every psychopath every sociopath in a governmental socialist or communist or command
[1:29:43.800 --> 1:29:51.000]  control system gets a place at the table to sap off you and run your life we're on the march the
[1:29:51.000 --> 1:29:56.040]  empires on the run alex jones and the gcn radio network
[1:30:00.120 --> 1:30:06.600]  hillary clinton says if she becomes president she'd like to open up the government files on area 51
[1:30:06.600 --> 1:30:11.240]  once and for all she said if there's something there unless it's a threat to national security
[1:30:11.240 --> 1:30:16.120]  we ought to share it with the public so clinton's willing to disclose classified briefings about
[1:30:16.120 --> 1:30:22.120]  extraterrestrial life but sets up a secret server to hide her own emails those must be some
[1:30:22.120 --> 1:30:28.040]  top secret communications newly disclosed clinton emails show that officials in the it office were
[1:30:28.040 --> 1:30:32.920]  baffled when they were told that a young technician would join them as a political appointee the
[1:30:32.920 --> 1:30:39.080]  technician brian pagliano was running the off-grid email server that clinton had him set up in her
[1:30:39.080 --> 1:30:44.760]  new york home for her work as secretary of state clinton paid him separately to maintain the server
[1:30:44.760 --> 1:30:50.520]  now clinton has admitted that she tries not to lie but she didn't say anything about willfully
[1:30:50.520 --> 1:30:56.760]  participating in a campaign of misinformation the truth is out there leon macadre reporting for

[1:33:05.480 --> 1:33:13.880]  example why because each of them had mass killings somebody somewhere will comment and say obama
[1:33:13.880 --> 1:33:20.120]  politicized this issue well this is something we should politicize i'm not going to carry a gun i
[1:33:20.120 --> 1:33:26.440]  don't want to be involved in a gunfight if i could have gotten 51 votes in the senate of the united
[1:33:26.440 --> 1:33:34.440]  states for an outright ban picking up every one of them mr and mrs america turn them all in
[1:33:39.800 --> 1:33:47.240]  go ahead make my day so the notion that gun laws don't work it's not born out by the evidence
[1:33:47.240 --> 1:33:53.080]  he says that the chicago police had a plan over this bloody fourth of july weekend
[1:33:53.080 --> 1:33:59.640]  nonetheless as you indicated quarry there was a count of casualties that could have been from
[1:33:59.640 --> 1:34:06.120]  afghanistan or iraq will make it harder for law abiding citizens and criminals will still get
[1:34:06.120 --> 1:34:14.760]  their guns in many cases the offenders uh felons uh some out on parole some out on bond but we have
[1:34:14.760 --> 1:34:20.840]  to respect the tradition in this country of people who want to defend themselves and their family
[1:34:20.840 --> 1:34:28.760]  from violence there are people at high levels in this government who have bodyguards 24 hours a day
[1:34:28.760 --> 1:34:35.240]  seven days a week the average american does not have that may have been right why why why can you
[1:34:35.240 --> 1:34:40.760]  defend yourself but not the majority of americans i mean look at look at the team of security you got
[1:34:40.760 --> 1:34:46.200]  every day every school at every level one thing that i think is clear with young people and with
[1:34:46.200 --> 1:34:51.400]  adults as well is that we just have to be repetitive about this and we need to do this every day of the
[1:34:51.400 --> 1:34:57.720]  week and just really brainwash people into thinking about guns in a vastly different way was this the
[1:34:57.720 --> 1:35:03.720]  weapon of choice for a new kind of terrorist when a five-year-old girl said she and a classmate
[1:35:03.720 --> 1:35:10.120]  should shoot each other with bubbles the school called it a terrorist threat ak-47s belonging
[1:35:10.120 --> 1:35:14.440]  to the hands of soldiers not in the hands of criminals you know the right to bear arms is because
[1:35:14.440 --> 1:35:23.160]  that's the last form of defense against tyranny but we don't need the ability to arm ourselves
[1:35:23.160 --> 1:35:27.960]  against the army or the police what kind of a situation in the u.s would you see that happening
[1:35:27.960 --> 1:35:32.360]  i mean we've got a lot of constitution listening to a lot of people that it's not power weapons
[1:35:32.360 --> 1:35:38.520]  discover the clergy would help the government with potentially their biggest problem us to say
[1:35:38.520 --> 1:35:44.360]  we're not turning our guns in and we're not running and we're not knocking down if you want to
[1:35:46.360 --> 1:35:53.000]  rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty it's alec jones
[1:35:53.000 --> 1:36:10.120]  ladies and gentlemen we're doing the best job we can to stand up against the globalist
[1:36:10.120 --> 1:36:14.840]  i want to open the phones up for people that have lived in communist countries and who have
[1:36:14.840 --> 1:36:19.400]  experienced what it's like to be brought up under it in fact daria i know moved here when she was
[1:36:19.400 --> 1:36:23.960]  younger and has been in the military and been at fort bragg and defense language school and you name
[1:36:23.960 --> 1:36:29.480]  it uh and she's from russia i'd like to get her view maybe i kind of spring on this honor i hear
[1:36:29.480 --> 1:36:34.680]  about 10 minutes for a couple minutes or so about her views of all this but it's like hearing oh over
[1:36:34.680 --> 1:36:37.880]  in england they have free health care they have some of the worst in the world and most of them come
[1:36:37.880 --> 1:36:42.600]  here to get their health care not that ours is perfect there's this ignorance of all these spoiled
[1:36:42.600 --> 1:36:48.360]  americans and westerners with their iPhones and their cars and their money going yeah i want free
[1:36:48.360 --> 1:36:52.440]  education yeah i want free bank account yeah i want direct payments from the government i don't want
[1:36:52.440 --> 1:36:59.080]  to work and now because of robots and the rest of it we're going to almost be at the point but
[1:36:59.080 --> 1:37:03.720]  the government's not going to let you have all the goodies unless you politically do what they want
[1:37:05.080 --> 1:37:09.960]  and that's called basically selling your soul so i'm going to give the number out for people
[1:37:09.960 --> 1:37:14.680]  that have lived in communist countries or totalitarian countries and to give us your view
[1:37:14.680 --> 1:37:19.000]  on what you think of the president coming out and saying hey you know what
[1:37:21.880 --> 1:37:24.920]  um you guys have a a feed open
[1:37:28.200 --> 1:37:30.200]  i want to hear from you specific listeners
[1:37:33.400 --> 1:37:37.960]  who have been through this or maybe you love communism maybe you lived in it and you loved it
[1:37:37.960 --> 1:37:41.080]  i've never heard anybody that lived through it loved it unless they were an inner party member
[1:37:41.080 --> 1:37:48.360]  living in a palace i mean the russian leaders the communists had their own race tracks for cars
[1:37:48.360 --> 1:37:53.560]  horses huge palaces dozens of mistresses did whatever they wanted and everybody else just
[1:37:53.560 --> 1:37:57.800]  lived like slaves and they're going to see all these idiots running around talking about how bad
[1:37:57.800 --> 1:38:04.600]  freedom is and we've just been a limited form of capitalism it's been crony pretty much from day one
[1:38:04.600 --> 1:38:10.600]  but compared to communism oh my gosh and i want to read the sultz and eason quote here in a moment
[1:38:10.600 --> 1:38:21.320]  the toll free number to join us is 800 259 92 31 800 259 92 31 and we'll get you up and on the air
[1:38:23.320 --> 1:38:27.400]  but the reason i'm so upset is you can feel the quickening you can tell that everything's
[1:38:27.400 --> 1:38:32.040]  accelerating as i've said the last few years get ready and notice it's now happening communism is
[1:38:32.040 --> 1:38:37.800]  good world government is good the family is bad christianity is bad uh we're coming for you
[1:38:37.800 --> 1:38:43.080]  because they're getting ready to go purely operational does it mean huge false flags
[1:38:43.080 --> 1:38:47.080]  does it mean economic collapse does it mean new big wars does it mean activating islamic
[1:38:47.080 --> 1:38:55.000]  sleeper cells they have inside the country 800 259 92 31 but our story is up on info wars dot
[1:38:55.000 --> 1:38:59.240]  com it's on drudge report dot com as well and president planet dot com obama there's little
[1:38:59.240 --> 1:39:04.360]  difference between communism and capitalism president obama stoked controversy after he
[1:39:04.360 --> 1:39:08.440]  suggested to an audience of argentinian youth that there was no greater difference between
[1:39:08.440 --> 1:39:13.560]  communism and capitalism and they should get just get and choose from what works
[1:39:15.400 --> 1:39:21.160]  obama responded to a question about nonprofit community organizers and the necessity of
[1:39:21.160 --> 1:39:25.960]  attracting funding from both the public and private sectors so often the past there has
[1:39:25.960 --> 1:39:30.200]  been division between the left and right between capitalist and communist or socialist and especially
[1:39:30.200 --> 1:39:36.200]  in the americas that's been a big debate those are interesting intellectual arguments but i
[1:39:36.200 --> 1:39:43.320]  think for your generation for your generation you should be practical and just choose from what
[1:39:43.320 --> 1:39:48.120]  works yeah just just work with the big multinationals who are tax exempt who come in and put you
[1:39:48.120 --> 1:39:52.200]  under communism and since you're going to be the managers you could actually be managers for us so
[1:39:52.200 --> 1:39:57.480]  just have no morals at all just be a slave master you don't have to worry about whether it really
[1:39:57.480 --> 1:40:01.720]  fits into a socialist theory or capitalist theory you should just decide what works he added see
[1:40:01.720 --> 1:40:06.360]  that's globalism constantly being above the law doing whatever you want screwing everyone over
[1:40:06.360 --> 1:40:17.800]  having total inequality and calling it flexibility 300 million chinese farmers forced off their land
[1:40:17.800 --> 1:40:23.160]  in the cultural revolution and the great leap forward and 60 something million starving to death
[1:40:23.160 --> 1:40:29.880]  and mal killing another 20 million by the gun little poor farmers 60 million dead oh that's
[1:40:29.880 --> 1:40:35.720]  flexible and then david rockefeller writes a article when mal dies for the new york times
[1:40:35.720 --> 1:40:42.840]  praising his efficiency and a model for capitalism and people go capitalism mal was the top communist
[1:40:42.840 --> 1:40:47.720]  oh obama just came out and said the two can work together that means multinationals are
[1:40:47.720 --> 1:40:51.880]  tax exempt above the law offshore i know i keep just repeating that because that's the key to
[1:40:51.880 --> 1:40:57.560]  everything folks and they hide this in plain view just like they bring in millions of radical
[1:40:57.560 --> 1:41:02.520]  islamists from war torn areas that invaded those countries with fake passports don't even check them
[1:41:02.520 --> 1:41:07.800]  let them attack us and then tell us we've got to give up our rights but bring in more of these
[1:41:07.800 --> 1:41:13.080]  people who are incompatible and don't want to live with us because at least they're anti-western
[1:41:13.080 --> 1:41:19.400]  anti-christian and that's enough yes a jihadi isn't a good inter-party communist member that just
[1:41:19.400 --> 1:41:24.600]  you know that doesn't know that it's an organized crime faction of eugenicists in a satanic operation
[1:41:24.600 --> 1:41:29.720]  to hate humanity and set themselves up as absolute gods in adam vise hop's own writings
[1:41:31.080 --> 1:41:35.640]  oh i know the intellectuals think communism began with das kapital and marx and engels
[1:41:36.280 --> 1:41:43.480]  more mental midgets it's on record it came from the illuminate of bravaria and was launched
[1:41:43.480 --> 1:41:51.800]  operationally in 1780s in france look it up the jackabins how many historians do i have on i bring
[1:41:51.800 --> 1:41:55.720]  that up and they go that's actually all correct the jackabin operation is what we're going to be
[1:41:55.720 --> 1:42:02.440]  facing and then off the other be like are you part of any secret organizations how do you even know
[1:42:02.440 --> 1:42:09.640]  this we'd like you to come immediately to oxford we'd like you to privately address the faculty
[1:42:09.640 --> 1:42:16.040]  and then have a public address but oh oh no thanks i better not come to that i i know what
[1:42:16.040 --> 1:42:23.320]  goes on behind the scenes the general public has no idea no idea no idea what you're about to go
[1:42:23.320 --> 1:42:33.400]  through and always the answer when communism delivers long lines and poverty will be oh
[1:42:33.400 --> 1:42:39.240]  obama didn't give you the free health care bernie is now and then oh he won't this new pollock
[1:42:39.240 --> 1:42:44.360]  bureau leader will they're going to bring it's going to be chicken in every pie we're going to
[1:42:44.360 --> 1:42:48.920]  have all these wonderful government people with multinational corporations milking it above us
[1:42:48.920 --> 1:42:54.280]  isn't that going to be fantastic let's read what the nobel prize winner he said he wanted to give
[1:42:54.280 --> 1:42:58.840]  us prize away by the way right a bunch of other books are even more powerful alexander sheldson
[1:42:58.840 --> 1:43:04.920]  needs him and how we burned in the camps later thinking what would things have been like if
[1:43:04.920 --> 1:43:10.600]  every security operative when he went out at night to make an arrest had been uncertain whether he
[1:43:10.600 --> 1:43:19.320]  would return alive and had to say goodbye to his family or if during periods of mass arrest as for
[1:43:19.320 --> 1:43:25.560]  example in leningrad when they arrest a quarter of the entire city people had not simply sat there
[1:43:25.560 --> 1:43:30.920]  in their layers pawling with terror at every bang on the downstairs door and every step in the
[1:43:30.920 --> 1:43:36.440]  staircase but it understood that they had nothing left to lose nothing left to lose and had boldly
[1:43:36.440 --> 1:43:43.880]  set up in the downstairs hall an ambush of half a dozen people with axes hammers pokers and whatever
[1:43:43.880 --> 1:43:50.360]  else was in hand these organs would have quickly have suffered a shortage of officers and transport
[1:43:50.360 --> 1:43:56.280]  and notwithstanding all of stalin's thirst for blood the cursed machine would have ground to a halt
[1:43:56.280 --> 1:44:03.960]  if if we didn't love freedom enough and even more we had no awareness of the real situation we purely
[1:44:03.960 --> 1:44:18.440]  and simply deserved everything that happened afterwards we deserved everything that happened
[1:44:18.440 --> 1:44:24.280]  afterwards because we knew that guy could really write he could really just simply write but had
[1:44:24.280 --> 1:44:34.040]  a way of really saying how the soul saw it straight up writing if if we'd love freedom enough and if
[1:44:34.040 --> 1:44:41.880]  if we wouldn't have known but we deserved everything we got he doesn't have to say we knew he said
[1:44:41.880 --> 1:44:49.400]  if we only would have known but we deserved everything we got because we did know didn't we
[1:44:50.520 --> 1:44:56.040]  you act like you don't know you know and so many of you think you're gonna get out of this
[1:44:56.600 --> 1:45:01.640]  going along with the speech they say we now have a country in a world where they tell you how to talk
[1:45:03.320 --> 1:45:09.720]  and again they're down to saying don't say border girl say g or he or g or i mean cult
[1:45:09.720 --> 1:45:19.240]  brainwashing the cursed machine would have ground to a halt if if we didn't love freedom enough and
[1:45:19.240 --> 1:45:27.640]  even more we had no awareness of the real situation we purely and simply deserved everything that
[1:45:27.640 --> 1:45:35.320]  happened afterwards and then shaltzen each and wrote books about how the west funded the whole
[1:45:35.320 --> 1:45:42.760]  soviet takeover of the world before that and before that the the bolshevik takeover in 1917
[1:45:42.760 --> 1:45:47.400]  and now they're going to do it here and america is going to be this big evil thing running around
[1:45:47.400 --> 1:45:52.120]  taking over and the world will stand against it and it'll collapse down the road and then
[1:45:53.000 --> 1:45:56.840]  you know apologize for what it did i mean this is just how they flip it over and over again
[1:45:57.400 --> 1:46:01.480]  and then things that don't look as tyrannical that are opposing it are accepted by the people
[1:46:01.480 --> 1:46:08.440]  because they're opposing this new great evil that's how the little mind games work i'm gonna go to

[1:54:32.840 --> 1:54:38.200]  it's a badge of honor but megan kelly lies about donald trump it's a badge of honor
[1:54:38.200 --> 1:54:44.600]  you guys are the ones that are mean and so we're here to tell you no more mr nice guy from us
[1:54:47.080 --> 1:54:51.640]  all right let's go back to the caller goose in new york then we're gonna go to stefan and others
[1:54:51.640 --> 1:54:59.800]  goose in new york okay tell us your venezuela story sir okay so um there's this uh a pasta shop
[1:54:59.800 --> 1:55:03.960]  that i usually go to in new york uh actually anybody who's in new york should check it out i
[1:55:03.960 --> 1:55:09.000]  think it's called pia monte it's in little it'll be um there's this ecuadorian woman who runs it
[1:55:09.000 --> 1:55:17.400]  and every time i go in we check she asked me where i was from i told her venezuela and automatically
[1:55:17.400 --> 1:55:23.080]  she thinks oh well but you know fantastic country um had one of the best economies in the world at
[1:55:23.080 --> 1:55:28.200]  one point and uh that's where a lot of people a lot of people from ecuadorian from nearby countries
[1:55:28.200 --> 1:55:33.160]  used to go over to venezuela to look for work and to start a much better life and i had to
[1:55:33.160 --> 1:55:38.680]  break it to her that uh no that's not how it is anymore actually have family from venezuela who
[1:55:38.680 --> 1:55:44.040]  now left and they went to ecuador that's right for folks that don't know they took countries
[1:55:44.680 --> 1:55:48.680]  in the 40s 50s 60s and 70s and made them quote go socialist then later they just come out and say no
[1:55:48.680 --> 1:55:53.400]  i'm actually a communist uh like like uh he was shot this turned out he was signing him on to all
[1:55:53.400 --> 1:55:59.160]  these debts keeping the money on purpose that's the deal and it's so sick so so what's the country
[1:55:59.160 --> 1:56:07.800]  like now versus when you were there well uh last time i was there was in 2009 and i've never i didn't
[1:56:07.800 --> 1:56:15.240]  go back i i'd never wanted to go back after that uh there's so much violence um i have a a cousin
[1:56:15.240 --> 1:56:20.360]  who actually was working in the administration and he left he went to ecuador um that's how
[1:56:20.360 --> 1:56:29.240]  bad things got and he was in is actually involved in the party um but his wife uh was a forensic
[1:56:29.240 --> 1:56:34.440]  scientist and for sometimes she worked in uh morgue uh doing autopsies and she would tell me
[1:56:34.440 --> 1:56:40.360]  she would get 80 bodies on a weekend if you can think about that number every week and 80 bodies
[1:56:40.360 --> 1:56:46.360]  coming in that's how much violence there was there there's it's just an impressive uh i would see
[1:56:46.360 --> 1:56:52.120]  violence all the time i saw some guy outside of a bank at uh shank and tried to hold you know
[1:56:52.120 --> 1:56:57.960]  sorry to your viewers or to your listeners but you know just trying to hold in his his insights
[1:56:57.960 --> 1:57:06.120]  yeah and um and then one of my neighbors got uh he got his head busted open and torched alive and
[1:57:06.120 --> 1:57:11.320]  and it was it kind of crazy never that's what happens when the resources get taken away if a
[1:57:11.320 --> 1:57:15.720]  country never had resources and then they get taken away it gets worse it's not that bad
[1:57:15.720 --> 1:57:21.640]  but you take resources away from countries that were really well off like argentina or
[1:57:21.640 --> 1:57:27.560]  venezuela they descend into hell look at mexico a lot of poor people but they they had culture
[1:57:27.560 --> 1:57:32.920]  they had a life they were culturally rich they're now in deep trouble and we're gonna when we fall
[1:57:32.920 --> 1:57:37.400]  it's going to make mexico look like a cakewalk folks and i'm sorry to say that i mean it's going
[1:57:37.400 --> 1:57:42.760]  to be explosive god bless you good to hear from you gush stefan in florida lived in yugoslavia
[1:57:42.760 --> 1:57:48.680]  give us your take on it go ahead uh help uh uh my name is stefan uh i used to live a couple
[1:57:48.680 --> 1:57:55.480]  decades in yugoslavia watch watch the show for quite a while and uh okay i have to admit i live
[1:57:55.480 --> 1:58:00.280]  there only from 70s and 80s so i really didn't see like the post second world war was going on
[1:58:01.080 --> 1:58:06.360]  but uh in late in late stage i mean it was uh kind of pretty pretty civil all the kind of like
[1:58:06.360 --> 1:58:12.760]  darchy stuff was going on after second world war but sure and i mean tito from one of research was
[1:58:12.760 --> 1:58:16.920]  one of the better communist leaders uh because he wanted to have wealth and things and kind of ignored
[1:58:16.920 --> 1:58:22.360]  it uh and then after he went things fell apart because just just gangsterism and infighting took
[1:58:22.360 --> 1:58:27.400]  over uh but but still you're saying they had the duchies the communists were rich the inner party
[1:58:27.400 --> 1:58:33.160]  was rich everybody else was poor well i mean that's kind of like very very like for example tito
[1:58:33.160 --> 1:58:38.200]  himself uh when she died she she left zero dollars with the family i mean sure she did stay there

[2:01:25.080 --> 2:01:29.480]  i was speaking like somebody who's living there it's like i think like people are people are way
[2:01:29.480 --> 2:01:35.240]  much confusing like uh communism as a political template like what marx and england english wrote
[2:01:35.240 --> 2:01:40.360]  with the political deeds of certain dictatorship government and so on it's like you know let's
[2:01:40.360 --> 2:01:45.400]  say nobody nobody's ever gonna blame any capitalist the capitalist government
[2:01:48.120 --> 2:01:52.600]  brother i want to go to you but i just can't understand much of it but i get what you're saying
[2:01:53.560 --> 2:01:58.120]  you're saying that there's one thing to have it in theory and a university but it always just
[2:01:58.120 --> 2:02:01.800]  creates a horrible dictatorship with a new ruling class above the law correct
[2:02:03.000 --> 2:02:07.640]  no i think it's like uh i think like it's uh each time you feel a comment
[2:02:09.640 --> 2:02:13.480]  i'm gonna let you go i can't understand you i'm sorry stefan thanks for calling though uh you know

[2:02:22.760 --> 2:02:29.160]  a new hap wherever that is uh you said you you said you lived in china what's your view on it
[2:02:31.240 --> 2:02:35.720]  well just first off i want to say uh super male vitality way better than i thought it was going
[2:02:35.720 --> 2:02:43.320]  to be uh but getting into china uh went there went there the student shocked i'm super into
[2:02:43.320 --> 2:02:47.960]  martial arts i love chinese culture and when i went there i realized i knew more about their
[2:02:47.960 --> 2:02:54.920]  culture than they did the cultural revolution basically stole everything from them uh three main
[2:02:54.920 --> 2:02:58.920]  points i want to bring that's the biggest thing oh my gosh you're so gosh i love our collars that
[2:02:58.920 --> 2:03:03.800]  actually get their points in that's it they take your culture they erase everything one of the
[2:03:03.800 --> 2:03:08.120]  richest probably the richest in the world's the chinese the oldest incredible and they got the
[2:03:08.120 --> 2:03:13.480]  ultimate capitalist the ultimate hard workers the cliche is true killed like a third of them
[2:03:13.480 --> 2:03:20.760]  erased it all ruined it and put some alien globalist uh communist garbage in over i'm sorry go ahead
[2:03:22.040 --> 2:03:26.120]  no no it's it's fine i but that was one of the biggest things that hit me the hardest
[2:03:26.120 --> 2:03:30.520]  when i got there it was like i was expecting jackie chan's and kung fu fighters the whole
[2:03:30.520 --> 2:03:35.560]  time and i was just walking around and everybody was like weak just weak people and and i had an
[2:03:35.560 --> 2:03:40.840]  older guy come up to me and he passed me secretly like this book on daoism he was just splitted
[2:03:40.840 --> 2:03:45.000]  under the table to me and was like hey man you know we're not allowed to tell people about this
[2:03:45.000 --> 2:03:50.120]  nowadays the kids don't know about this and i just it was so bad they kill you for teaching that
[2:03:50.120 --> 2:03:56.600]  they kill you oh yeah and uh i was speaking to one lady one lady was basically saying she you
[2:03:56.600 --> 2:04:01.880]  can't have a job in the government if you have religion and uh mouth they tongue is their religion
[2:04:01.880 --> 2:04:06.120]  they hate mouth they tongue and they love them at the same time it's a love hate relationship with
[2:04:06.120 --> 2:04:11.800]  them and i feel like that's kind of who obama wants to be like he wants to be loved and hated but he
[2:04:11.800 --> 2:04:16.600]  just wants to be known he just wants to his faith everywhere yeah he wants the guy to bring fundamental
[2:04:16.600 --> 2:04:22.360]  incredible change and he's the guy that defends uh fidel castro uh mouth say tongue the greatest
[2:04:22.360 --> 2:04:27.800]  mass murder in history and and and you're right the chinese hate mouth say tongue even the party
[2:04:27.800 --> 2:04:33.960]  admits he killed 84 million people the cia says 60 something they say 84 and people forget they
[2:04:33.960 --> 2:04:40.760]  arrested his wife after he died well and and the craziest part about it is that you know they have
[2:04:40.760 --> 2:04:44.840]  the little mal read books i tell you what stay there i got two big guests coming on but i want
[2:04:44.840 --> 2:04:47.960]  you to be able to finish what you were saying because i want to kick the discussion off with
[2:04:47.960 --> 2:04:53.560]  mr dent and mr shiff straight ahead on the incredible announcement of obama about how great
[2:04:53.560 --> 2:04:56.840]  communism is stay there liberty we'll be right back call from new hamster
[2:04:56.840 --> 2:05:06.760]  chris says if she becomes president she'd like to open up the government files on area 51 once
[2:05:06.760 --> 2:05:11.480]  and for all she said if there's something there unless it's a threat to national security we ought
[2:05:11.480 --> 2:05:16.920]  to share it with the public so clinton's willing to disclose classified briefings about extraterrestrial
[2:05:16.920 --> 2:05:23.880]  life but sets up a secret server to hide her own emails those must be some top secret communications
[2:05:23.880 --> 2:05:29.240]  newly disclosed clinton emails show that officials in the it office were baffled when they were told
[2:05:29.240 --> 2:05:34.600]  that a young technician would join them as a political appointee the technician brian pagliano
[2:05:34.600 --> 2:05:40.520]  was running the off-grid email server that clinton had him set up in her new york home for her work
[2:05:40.520 --> 2:05:45.720]  as secretary of state clinton paid him separately to maintain the server now clinton has admitted
[2:05:45.720 --> 2:05:51.560]  that she tries not to lie but she didn't say anything about willfully participating in a
[2:05:51.560 --> 2:05:57.880]  campaign of misinformation the truth is out there leon macata reporting for info wars.com

[2:08:32.120 --> 2:08:42.120]  so
[2:08:42.120 --> 2:08:49.720]  welcome back ladies and gentlemen we've got loaded phones from romania uh italy folks talking
[2:08:49.720 --> 2:08:54.920]  about bosnia china people that are there in country and people calling in from the united states
[2:08:54.920 --> 2:09:01.640]  with their horror stories of living under communism or even mild quote communism like venezuela where oh
[2:09:01.640 --> 2:09:08.680]  we're socialist we're not communist and then guess what we're communist and blue collar people being
[2:09:08.680 --> 2:09:16.280]  kicked out of their homes and communist being moved in hereditary little farms four or five generations
[2:09:17.000 --> 2:09:22.360]  poor people and the communists show up and say you're going to pay us particularly a percentage
[2:09:22.360 --> 2:09:26.760]  of what you make locally and you're going to come by and you're going to work in my farm
[2:09:26.760 --> 2:09:32.040]  for nothing or i'm going to have you arrested that's venezuela that's communist light
[2:09:32.040 --> 2:09:38.680]  and then to see espn and msnbc with people being grabbed saying libertah down with the castros
[2:09:39.240 --> 2:09:46.200]  dictators young people being beaten up and drug away by police into cars and espn laughing with
[2:09:46.200 --> 2:09:51.960]  obama and the reporters laughing when look ha ha yeah they got them they'll do that when they come
[2:09:51.960 --> 2:09:58.040]  arrest peter schiff or anybody else they want to folks i'm telling you or ron paul or matt drudge or
[2:09:58.040 --> 2:10:02.840]  alex jones or harry dent and then obama saying we need to use some of the stuff from communism
[2:10:02.840 --> 2:10:07.400]  some of the stuff from socialism now liberty monk i'm going to briefly go back to him because
[2:10:07.400 --> 2:10:12.680]  this kicks off this whole interview i wanted to get both these gentlemen on harry dent and peter
[2:10:12.680 --> 2:10:18.040]  schiff harry dent dot com europe pack dot com is peter schiff's site not to have a debate because
[2:10:18.040 --> 2:10:23.720]  both guys have been following for a decade or so schiff even longer and they're about 95 accurate
[2:10:23.720 --> 2:10:29.000]  they have some of the most high accuracy rates just from reading their work and watching them
[2:10:29.000 --> 2:10:32.840]  that are out there but they disagree on a few things like gold gold's been going back up a little
[2:10:32.840 --> 2:10:39.480]  bit uh and and when things are going to implode and how uh so i don't know who's more right and
[2:10:39.480 --> 2:10:44.200]  it's not going to be a contest about who is more right it's about really having a serious debate
[2:10:44.200 --> 2:10:48.280]  because i want to know and i know you want to know about the global meltdown that's accelerating
[2:10:48.280 --> 2:10:51.560]  the fellow reserves saying they're out of bullets but still saying they're not going to increase
[2:10:51.560 --> 2:10:56.920]  rates now uh and all the things that are happening it is an epic time so i think it's more of a
[2:10:56.920 --> 2:11:01.880]  discussion about how bad is it going to get and what's the next shoe to drop is there any way to
[2:11:01.880 --> 2:11:05.320]  pull out of this so we're going to talk to these men here in about two minutes three minutes but
[2:11:05.880 --> 2:11:13.240]  if you just tuned in here's obama in argentina it was a wealthy free market country quasi out of
[2:11:13.240 --> 2:11:21.000]  another form of collectivism for the elite control of what was put in there uh basically by the european
[2:11:21.000 --> 2:11:26.440]  powers colonialism but it was almost as rich as the u.s rich as in argentine in some areas may
[2:11:26.440 --> 2:11:31.160]  be richer than people in the u.s until they wanted her globalism went into debt brought in socialism
[2:11:31.720 --> 2:11:36.920]  really smart hard-working great people and they are now up the creek without a paddle or even a boat
[2:11:36.920 --> 2:11:44.040]  venezuela was wealthy and happy just 40 50 years ago now it's a hellhole that's admitted and obama
[2:11:44.040 --> 2:11:49.960]  is up they're saying oh capitalism oh you know communism take from both we need we you know we
[2:11:49.960 --> 2:11:55.640]  need multinationalism we need we need you know these big multinational trade groups that's globalist
[2:11:55.640 --> 2:12:01.080]  companies tax exempt regulation exempt they get to come into cuba they get to come into china get
[2:12:01.080 --> 2:12:08.440]  sweetheart deals with the interparty officials that is slavery folks communism doesn't exist in my
[2:12:08.440 --> 2:12:12.680]  view we'll get both these experts view on that but first here is a condensed clip it goes on for
[2:12:12.680 --> 2:12:18.840]  like 10 minutes full clips up on info wars dot com our stories on drudge report dot com obama
[2:12:18.840 --> 2:12:23.240]  there's little difference between communism and capitalism because ron paul said it hundreds of
[2:12:23.240 --> 2:12:28.440]  times when the real collapse comes with this global system based on fraud they're going to blame
[2:12:28.440 --> 2:12:34.680]  capitalism and bring in something even worse crony capitalism on top of communism and now
[2:12:34.680 --> 2:12:39.560]  we're here how do we get the public to understand what's happening we're going to spend the rest
[2:12:39.560 --> 2:12:44.680]  of the hour on this with our guests in a moment we're in the third hour here today chicory jackson
[2:12:44.680 --> 2:12:50.680]  hosts the fourth hour today but right now let's go to this ominous clip he thought him posing
[2:12:50.680 --> 2:12:58.200]  uh monday in front of shea guvara a mass murderer a guy that called native american subhuman and
[2:12:58.200 --> 2:13:04.600]  black people basically names i'm not going to repeat this is who obama stood in front of
[2:13:04.600 --> 2:13:07.960]  we ought to get his quotes and actually put that picture of obama back up with all the racist
[2:13:07.960 --> 2:13:15.400]  quotes of shea guvara communists are so hateful here it is you know so often in the past there's
[2:13:15.400 --> 2:13:23.480]  been a sharp division between left and right between capitalist and communists or socialists
[2:13:23.480 --> 2:13:32.040]  and especially in the americas that's been a big debate right ah you know you're you're a capitalist
[2:13:32.040 --> 2:13:40.280]  yankee dog and oh you know you're some you know crazy communists you know that's going to take
[2:13:40.280 --> 2:13:49.160]  away everybody's property and i mean those are in interesting intellectual arguments but i think
[2:13:49.160 --> 2:13:56.280]  for your generation you should be practical and just choose from what works you don't have to worry
[2:13:56.280 --> 2:14:03.240]  about whether it neatly fits into socialist theory or capitalist theory you just decide what works
[2:14:03.240 --> 2:14:05.640]  all right hit pause i'm not going to liberty muck at the bottom of the hour we can hold because i'm
[2:14:05.640 --> 2:14:09.480]  going to go to our guests and i want to finish this clip but understand china doesn't just take
[2:14:09.480 --> 2:14:15.000]  your property if you're a poor farmer that they rob the poor it's the rich doing it's it's just highway
[2:14:15.000 --> 2:14:22.280]  robbery they take your organs if you're a buddhist and have committed no crime they have mobile
[2:14:22.280 --> 2:14:25.880]  execution vans that's the associated press they killed 80 plus million of their own people
[2:14:26.760 --> 2:14:31.320]  but he says oh intellectually but that doesn't exist oh yeah just like tyranny's never around
[2:14:31.320 --> 2:14:34.920]  the corner you didn't build your business let's finish the clip and go to our guests here it is
[2:14:34.920 --> 2:14:43.080]  and so you don't have to be rigid in saying it's it's either this or that you can say
[2:14:43.880 --> 2:14:51.400]  depending on the problem you're trying to solve depending on uh the social issues that you're
[2:14:51.400 --> 2:14:59.480]  trying to address what works oh it works and and i think that what you'll find is that the most
[2:14:59.480 --> 2:15:06.920]  successful societies the most successful economies are ones that are rooted in a market-based system
[2:15:07.480 --> 2:15:15.160]  but also recognize that a market does not work by itself it has to have a a social
[2:15:17.160 --> 2:15:23.480]  and moral and ethical and community basis that's enough that's enough to turn it off
[2:15:23.480 --> 2:15:27.640]  so you have to have communism managing it with the top generals getting billions
[2:15:27.640 --> 2:15:32.840]  over the slave camps and communism is the moral see capitalism you got to have it it's good to have
[2:15:32.840 --> 2:15:38.920]  it offshore running things but in the country the moralness is the communist because they killed
[2:15:38.920 --> 2:15:43.800]  the most people and is the most immoral thing on earth and the ultimate form of discrimination
[2:15:43.800 --> 2:15:49.400]  and absolute slavery this is a u.s. sitting president who just came back from cuba running
[2:15:49.400 --> 2:15:53.480]  around promoting communism i've never seen anything like it uh let's go to peter schiff because i
[2:15:53.480 --> 2:15:58.520]  could see him on the sky literally uh just turning red and laughing and but also getting
[2:15:58.520 --> 2:16:03.320]  angry i mean this is amazing then we'll go to mr uh dent harried it dot com url pack dot com is
[2:16:03.320 --> 2:16:10.200]  peter schiff's site uh wow uh mr schiff this is really wild yeah you know this is a disgrace i
[2:16:10.200 --> 2:16:14.600]  hadn't even heard about it until you were promoting this show and i quickly went online and saw it
[2:16:14.600 --> 2:16:20.360]  and i posted it on my on my facebook page but you know the fact that president obama is saying
[2:16:20.360 --> 2:16:25.720]  that well you have to look at communism and capitalism and choose what works doesn't he know
[2:16:25.720 --> 2:16:31.800]  that nothing about communism works it's a complete disgrace it has destroyed the lives of millions
[2:16:31.800 --> 2:16:35.720]  and millions of people literally many people's lives have been ended by communism but it's
[2:16:35.720 --> 2:16:40.760]  impoverished hundreds of millions of people the only thing that works is free market capitalism
[2:16:40.760 --> 2:16:46.280]  and if the president of the united states can't embrace that especially in a country like argentina
[2:16:46.280 --> 2:16:52.600]  after just coming from cuba i mean when can he embrace it well you heard him say that communists
[2:16:52.600 --> 2:16:56.680]  don't really take your property i mean that's like saying that you know that bears don't go to the
[2:16:56.680 --> 2:17:00.440]  bathroom in the woods i mean this is the biggest lie ever heard yeah it's like look we can just
[2:17:00.440 --> 2:17:04.600]  have a little bit of communism it's okay let's just use the good parts of communism yeah what are
[2:17:04.600 --> 2:17:09.400]  those good parts please identify those good parts there are no good parts it's all bad it's not like
[2:17:09.400 --> 2:17:14.280]  there's some baby that you don't want to throw out with the bathwater it's all bathwater we want
[2:17:14.280 --> 2:17:19.720]  free market capitalism the freer the better and if you want to talk about morality capitalism
[2:17:19.720 --> 2:17:25.080]  free market capitalism without all this government is the only moral economic system that exists
[2:17:27.080 --> 2:17:32.680]  absolutely um this is so important the death of our republic that that i've even been skipping
[2:17:32.680 --> 2:17:35.800]  breaks today because it's like a nuclear bomb went off or something new york i mean i'm just
[2:17:35.800 --> 2:17:40.440]  actually staggering around right now that it's getting so naked and i wonder what's coming next
[2:17:40.440 --> 2:17:45.160]  i also should introduce you guys harry dent obviously harry dent dot com we're about to go to him
[2:17:45.160 --> 2:17:48.840]  author of the demographic cliff an editor of the free newsletter economy and markets
[2:17:48.840 --> 2:17:52.520]  a big turnaround specialist of course with bank capital previously i'm not going to go through
[2:17:52.520 --> 2:17:57.000]  all of his harvard business school degrees and the rest of it some of the top companies he's run
[2:17:57.720 --> 2:18:01.160]  and then of course harry dent dot com's the website and then of course peter schiff
[2:18:01.160 --> 2:18:05.320]  you know has been on over the years even more than mr dent no stranger to this audience
[2:18:05.320 --> 2:18:10.360]  but a lot of new listeners he heads up billions in management with euro pacific capital euro
[2:18:10.360 --> 2:18:16.200]  pac.com and he's an american businessman investor broker his dad was a one of the top famous people
[2:18:16.200 --> 2:18:21.240]  exposing the irs fraud and died as a political prisoner uh just a few months ago sadly um and
[2:18:21.240 --> 2:18:27.560]  so euro pac.com is his site um let's go ahead and get uh mr dent's take on obama's statements
[2:18:27.560 --> 2:18:31.960]  and then i want to launch into where you both think uh the economy is currently in what your
[2:18:31.960 --> 2:18:37.160]  latest uh projections are and then maybe areas uh you guys disagree on them will also take some
[2:18:37.160 --> 2:18:42.120]  calls but mr dent good to have you with us as well yeah great to be back and hi peter haven't seen
[2:18:42.120 --> 2:18:49.320]  you since uh saint kitts uh i totally agree with the one statement he said about free market capitalism
[2:18:49.320 --> 2:18:57.480]  it it people don't realize in the late 1700s free market capitalism met democracy and they are
[2:18:57.480 --> 2:19:04.600]  actually opposite principles in a way where merit is totally uh represented and rewarded but everybody
[2:19:04.600 --> 2:19:11.480]  gets some say so it trickles down and and we've had both of those uh been killed in the last decade
[2:19:11.480 --> 2:19:17.400]  the central banks have hijacked free market capitalism totally set the markets with zero
[2:19:17.400 --> 2:19:22.680]  interest rates which means there's no risk in total speculation and and i know peter totally
[2:19:22.680 --> 2:19:29.240]  agrees with us on this we got a casino economy here but also democracy has been hijacked by
[2:19:29.240 --> 2:19:36.440]  special interest people with zillions of dollars that can decide whether mitt romney runs or not
[2:19:36.440 --> 2:19:40.760]  it's not whether you're in favor of mitt romney or not it's the fact that the co-brother said
[2:19:41.480 --> 2:19:49.800]  we veto him and that 158 158 families decided half the funding for all the primaries and stuff so
[2:19:50.360 --> 2:19:57.240]  so we have a a failure of what has made us successful and i think this is where peter and i totally
[2:19:57.240 --> 2:20:03.480]  agree free market capitalism and democracy to balance it out a bit has been the key to success
[2:20:03.480 --> 2:20:12.200]  for hundreds of years and why we're so wealthy and why china is not and russia is not and now
[2:20:12.200 --> 2:20:18.120]  we're killing the golden goose it's insanity killing the golden goose look i actually know i
[2:20:18.120 --> 2:20:23.640]  actually disagree with one point on democracy because uh the problem that you're talking about
[2:20:23.640 --> 2:20:29.160]  is an inherent flaw in democracy the founding fathers recognize that they call them factions
[2:20:29.160 --> 2:20:34.440]  and they wanted to protect us from the evils of democracy by installing an american republic
[2:20:34.440 --> 2:20:39.480]  with a lot of safeguards against democracy and the problem isn't that we don't have enough democracy
[2:20:39.480 --> 2:20:44.360]  we now have too much of it because those safeguards have been whittled away over the years by a supreme
[2:20:44.360 --> 2:20:49.160]  court that doesn't enforce the constitution sure i think special interest them manipulate the
[2:20:49.160 --> 2:20:54.600]  democratic vote in our democratic republic but but i mean i think we're basically debating different
[2:20:54.600 --> 2:21:01.000]  levels of this what would you call the real world system coming in where the top 10 corporations are
[2:21:01.000 --> 2:21:06.680]  so one a monopoly they control governments they are now promoting socialism to domesticate the
[2:21:06.680 --> 2:21:12.200]  general public to make them dependent to secure the monopolies what do we do when david rockefeller
[2:21:12.200 --> 2:21:18.120]  is promoting malice tongue in the new york times op-ed pieces i mean why why do we see ultra mega
[2:21:18.120 --> 2:21:25.320]  rich so many times in history to both of you a first shift uh financing and working with collectivism
[2:21:26.200 --> 2:21:31.960]  well you know what we have now is a a form of socialism fascism that's basically what we have
[2:21:31.960 --> 2:21:37.000]  i mean we have you can call it corporatism or crony capitalism but fascism really describes it you
[2:21:37.000 --> 2:21:42.440]  go back and look at uh mu salini uh italy under mu salini or even look at nazi germany take a
[2:21:42.440 --> 2:21:47.240]  way to concentration camps and the racism but if you look at the economic parts of that of what
[2:21:47.240 --> 2:21:52.280]  fascism was that's really what we've devolved into you know and people who think that fascism is the
[2:21:52.280 --> 2:21:58.360]  opposite of communism no it's not you know they're both forms of socialism communism is more extreme
[2:21:58.360 --> 2:22:03.480]  than fascism but i don't want either one to the opposite end is freedom i guess the extreme
[2:22:03.480 --> 2:22:08.120]  opposite is anarchy i don't want to go that far i want to go as close to anarchy as possible that's
[2:22:08.120 --> 2:22:13.160]  right but still have a government that that is dead on peter schiff what what is your view uh
[2:22:13.160 --> 2:22:17.080]  mr dent on what he just said and what would you call this global system and then adding to that
[2:22:17.080 --> 2:22:22.440]  what would you call china they call it one party rule uh communist capitalism what is it really
[2:22:23.000 --> 2:22:29.880]  okay here's the difference between communism and socialism socialism tries to include more people
[2:22:29.880 --> 2:22:36.040]  and and provide a safety net which up to a minor degree makes sense to me it's like have an insurance
[2:22:36.040 --> 2:22:40.840]  like all of us have insurance but when it comes to where anybody can get anything and there's no
[2:22:40.840 --> 2:22:48.760]  incentive to work obviously it's not good communism is different communism is top down management of
[2:22:48.760 --> 2:22:55.240]  the economy which is the worst possible thing because it gives the power to the political
[2:22:55.240 --> 2:23:00.760]  elite and the people who kiss their ass pardon my friend share um and that's what china is and
[2:23:00.760 --> 2:23:06.680]  that's what russia was and russia already failed russia tried to compete with the united states
[2:23:06.680 --> 2:23:12.360]  in the cold war and failed because their economy failed they put 10 times what we did in their
[2:23:12.360 --> 2:23:18.040]  military still couldn't keep up with us because free market capitalism works better and again
[2:23:18.040 --> 2:23:25.560]  democracy to me provides that a bit of a balance which is necessary which i hate to say it is kind
[2:23:25.560 --> 2:23:31.480]  of like socialism everybody has a vote and everybody has to do pretty well if the system is
[2:23:31.480 --> 2:23:41.240]  going to work unlike before democracy but it is capitalism that drives innovation drives uh and
[2:23:41.240 --> 2:23:47.080]  reinvest money in the best areas and and governments have stopped that there's no reinvestment
[2:23:48.280 --> 2:23:53.320]  so let me shift this and then back to you currently what would you call the u.s government versus
[2:23:53.320 --> 2:23:57.480]  the chinese government where do you think we're going and obviously they now admit both of you've
[2:23:57.480 --> 2:24:01.640]  been proven right that the federal reserve raising rates even a tiny bit didn't work that they would
[2:24:01.640 --> 2:24:06.040]  then stop they're talking about cutting them other countries are what's the real state of the world
[2:24:06.040 --> 2:24:10.840]  both of you say we're going to hell in a handbasket you know three four five years ago in the media
[2:24:10.840 --> 2:24:18.440]  says we were doing great you've been proven right so what's coming next well first of all go ahead
[2:24:18.440 --> 2:24:23.800]  Peter yeah well first of all with respect to you know to china i mean you don't have to have a vote
[2:24:23.800 --> 2:24:28.280]  to be free right i mean my vote is cancelled out doesn't even matter who i vote for because the guy
[2:24:28.280 --> 2:24:32.440]  i vote for is going to lose so the fact that i can vote doesn't mean i'm free what's important to me
[2:24:32.440 --> 2:24:36.920]  is economic freedom and actually in china there's a lot more of that now unfortunately than there is
[2:24:36.920 --> 2:24:40.760]  in the united states so just because you can't vote doesn't mean you don't have a lot of freedom
[2:24:40.760 --> 2:24:44.600]  and just because we can vote you know it doesn't mean we're free you know the russians could always
[2:24:44.600 --> 2:24:48.760]  vote you can always choose which communist you wanted to vote for so voting is overrated in most
[2:24:48.760 --> 2:24:54.360]  cases but getting back to the the economy one thing i agree with harry about completely is that
[2:24:54.360 --> 2:24:59.240]  the economy is a disaster all this talk about the recovery is president obama who's peddling
[2:24:59.240 --> 2:25:03.720]  fiction not not harry and i the economy is a mess thanks to the federal government he said a few
[2:25:03.720 --> 2:25:08.840]  months ago we have the best economy in us history yeah well he doesn't know anything about us history
[2:25:08.840 --> 2:25:13.320]  we he's proven that again today but he doesn't know that communism doesn't work so you can't
[2:25:13.320 --> 2:25:19.000]  believe anything that the president says but the only thing that where i disagree with harry
[2:25:19.000 --> 2:25:24.440]  is what does all this mean for the value of the dollar and for the price of gold because harry
[2:25:24.440 --> 2:25:28.440]  believes the us economy is going to fall apart and that's going to benefit the dollar and the price
[2:25:28.440 --> 2:25:32.280]  of gold is going to go down i think when the us economy falls apart the dollar's falling apart
[2:25:32.280 --> 2:25:38.840]  with it and i think gold's going to go up so we we we agree on the problem we just disagree on one
[2:25:38.840 --> 2:25:42.360]  aspect of what's going to happen as a result of the problem and it's an important aspect if you're
[2:25:42.360 --> 2:25:50.760]  an investor yeah it is important um alex and and and i just look at the evidence since the crisis
[2:25:50.760 --> 2:25:57.320]  started in january of 2008 that's when we officially entered the the great financial crisis before
[2:25:57.320 --> 2:26:03.000]  governments turned it around with zillions of dollars of stimulus just to to erase everything
[2:26:03.000 --> 2:26:11.160]  and cover it over the dollar has gone up it went up in the downturn gold went down in the second
[2:26:11.160 --> 2:26:16.680]  half of 2008 largely because of the rise of the dollar but but but the markets were telling you
[2:26:16.680 --> 2:26:22.840]  the dollar was the safe haven the best house in a bad neighborhood not gold because gold is a part
[2:26:22.840 --> 2:26:30.360]  of the commodity complex that went up in the early 2000s into 2008 to 2011 and has been crashing
[2:26:30.360 --> 2:26:36.040]  faster than any other bubble we're in a series of bubbles that are all crashing and gold is part of
[2:26:36.040 --> 2:26:40.840]  it the yeah let me let me address let me address an important distinction here so this is important
[2:26:40.840 --> 2:26:46.440]  so when the 2008 financial crisis hit the dollar was at an all-time record low going into that
[2:26:46.440 --> 2:26:51.240]  crisis and when the crisis started the reason the dollar rose is because people didn't know what was
[2:26:51.240 --> 2:26:54.840]  going to happen they thought banks were going to fail they thought all these dollars were going to
[2:26:54.840 --> 2:26:59.880]  disappear they didn't realize that there was going to be bailouts in qe1 and the minute the government
[2:26:59.880 --> 2:27:05.880]  bailed everything out the dollar tanked and the dollar didn't only start to rise until people
[2:27:05.880 --> 2:27:11.080]  believed the Fed has successfully saved the economy and that we were out of trouble that's when gold
[2:27:11.080 --> 2:27:15.640]  started to decline it was because everybody had confidence that we now had a sound economy
[2:27:15.640 --> 2:27:22.680]  and what the government did work once this next one let's let's let's let's let's let's let's let
[2:27:22.680 --> 2:27:28.360]  Harry's phone the dollar went up in the second half of 2008 when the financial institutions and
[2:27:28.360 --> 2:27:33.480]  layman brothers was going down it went that's because Harry that was my point that's because
[2:27:33.480 --> 2:27:37.480]  people thought that all these banks were going to fail the minute the government bailed everybody
[2:27:37.480 --> 2:27:42.200]  out and showed that no everybody was too big to fail the minute that happened the dollar reversed
[2:27:42.200 --> 2:27:49.720]  on a dime and tank okay let me have each of you let me do this let me do this let me do this
[2:27:50.760 --> 2:27:54.360]  three people yelling each other over satellite kind of messes up but with skype it kind of
[2:27:54.360 --> 2:27:57.720]  turns into a big echo chamber just hold us a minute we have a long segment coming up
[2:27:57.720 --> 2:28:01.880]  i want to give each of you you know three four minutes on your view on gold because this is
[2:28:01.880 --> 2:28:07.080]  kind of the debate segment where you guys disagree somewhat on the other side so that
[2:28:07.080 --> 2:28:10.040]  dent gets you know two or three minutes you get two or three minutes and then back and forth
[2:28:10.040 --> 2:28:14.920]  because i really want to hear both your views and i know the audience does we all respect each other
[2:28:14.920 --> 2:28:19.080]  this is really important not now i'll say this dent you were right that gold would start really
[2:28:19.080 --> 2:28:23.160]  going down the last few years but then you said you wouldn't expect it would go back up too much
[2:28:23.160 --> 2:28:29.560]  it has been going back up some you say it's not a commodity i guess shift says it is i really want
[2:28:29.560 --> 2:28:34.760]  to get both your views on this so you go ahead a dent for the next minute and a half or so
[2:28:34.760 --> 2:28:41.240]  then we'll come back let you finish up and then go to shift okay gold correlates with inflation it's
[2:28:41.240 --> 2:28:46.120]  the best inflation hedge in all of history that's why it was such a great investment in the crisis
[2:28:46.120 --> 2:28:52.600]  of the 70s which was an inflationary recession which i call the summer season in my four stage
[2:28:52.600 --> 2:28:59.640]  model over a lifetime gold does not do well in deflation and it is part of the commodity cycle
[2:28:59.640 --> 2:29:07.560]  that goes up and down every 30 years like a clock gold peak 1980 crashed into 1998 to 2001
[2:29:07.560 --> 2:29:16.280]  bubbled 7.7 times in 10 years into 2011 and is crashing it's a bubble bursting it will have long
[2:29:16.280 --> 2:29:22.280]  term prospects when we get inflation again but inflation is not in the cards because governments
[2:29:22.280 --> 2:29:27.320]  and central banks are doing one thing and one thing only they are printing massive amounts of
[2:29:27.320 --> 2:29:31.160]  money to prevent deflation okay stay there come back i'll give you a minute more and i want to
[2:29:31.160 --> 2:29:35.160]  ask the question though why is gold starting to go back up again a little bit i want to get your
[2:29:35.160 --> 2:29:40.040]  view on that we'll go for like three minutes back to petershev petershev of course is uropack.com

[2:33:38.120 --> 2:33:42.840]  anybody call in who lived under communism that supported it it was always some weird academic or
[2:33:42.840 --> 2:33:51.400]  some college student who wanted something free and these people really are sheltered and and
[2:33:51.400 --> 2:33:57.800]  wearing new designer clothes driving nice cars with with expensive iphones i've seen communist

[2:34:07.640 --> 2:34:12.040]  kind of makes sense they want to run and manage it and be the inner party members and they're

[2:37:18.280 --> 2:37:22.520]  for men there i'll say whatever you want now let's go back to petershift i've been ranting
[2:37:22.520 --> 2:37:26.760]  that was a short segment i want to have him be able to counter in just a moment but finishing up
[2:37:26.760 --> 2:37:31.560]  uh harry dent harry dent dot com with your view on gold and where it's going go ahead
[2:37:34.840 --> 2:37:40.520]  uh do we have uh harry dent there guys oh yeah okay i thought you're going to peter uh look
[2:37:40.520 --> 2:37:50.760]  gold bubbled up along with the entire commodity complex from 2001 into 2008 to 2011 in april late
[2:37:50.760 --> 2:37:57.480]  april 2011 at the day silver topped at 48 bucks we said this is the time to get out of gold and
[2:37:57.480 --> 2:38:02.680]  silver it's going to crash go to go to the next chart i have on gold uh gold was a bubble and
[2:38:02.680 --> 2:38:09.720]  now gold is bursting it went sideways after september 2011 for a couple of years and then
[2:38:09.720 --> 2:38:14.760]  broke a key resistance area at fifteen hundred twenty five dollars we were telling our newsletter
[2:38:14.760 --> 2:38:22.280]  subscribers it breaks 15 25 it is toast this bubble is over and it went down to 11 80 almost
[2:38:22.280 --> 2:38:28.680]  immediately and then bottom to 1050 and is bouncing this is a bear market bounce i've
[2:38:28.680 --> 2:38:33.960]  been calling for this more than anybody for the last several months gold is way oversold
[2:38:33.960 --> 2:38:38.920]  and is due to bounce to thirteen hundred dollars minimum and maybe as high as fourteen okay okay
[2:38:38.920 --> 2:38:43.320]  i'm gonna let you come back in a moment and and i am sorry i was about to go to shift and i realized
[2:38:43.320 --> 2:38:47.480]  i was you had another minute uh peter i think you had about four minutes here just to be even go
[2:38:47.480 --> 2:38:53.240]  ahead all right so let me reiterate this point now with gold so gold went from under three hundred
[2:38:53.240 --> 2:38:59.800]  dollars an ounce in 2000 to a high of a thousand on the eve of the 08 financial crisis now when
[2:38:59.800 --> 2:39:04.600]  that crisis hit nobody knew what was going to happen people thought banks were going to fail
[2:39:04.600 --> 2:39:09.240]  depositors were to lose their money uh people hadn't people were selling everything including
[2:39:09.240 --> 2:39:14.840]  gold and gold went down below seven hundred but then when the government came out with bailouts
[2:39:14.840 --> 2:39:20.440]  and zero percent interest rates and quantitative easing gold took off and it went to almost
[2:39:20.440 --> 2:39:25.880]  nineteen hundred dollars an ounce over the next few years now the reason that gold is declined
[2:39:25.880 --> 2:39:29.640]  from that point other than the fact that it got overbought and you had a lot of speculators
[2:39:29.640 --> 2:39:36.280]  who came rushing in is because everybody believed falsely that what the fed did work that the crisis
[2:39:36.280 --> 2:39:44.040]  was over and everything was great now here we are today in 2016 gold was above 1200 it's still 20
[2:39:44.040 --> 2:39:50.280]  percent higher than it was at its peak before the 2008 crisis but i think what's going to happen
[2:39:50.280 --> 2:39:55.000]  over the next several years and even this year is people are going to realize that what the fed
[2:39:55.000 --> 2:40:00.440]  did didn't work it backfired we're in a worse shape than we were before the financial crisis i
[2:40:00.440 --> 2:40:05.720]  think the fed is going back to zero i think they're going for QE for and i think the dollar is going
[2:40:05.720 --> 2:40:11.160]  to tank and gold is going to take off and harry said so himself that gold doesn't go up in deflation
[2:40:11.160 --> 2:40:15.400]  it goes up in inflation and we're going to have inflation the federal government the federal
[2:40:15.400 --> 2:40:19.800]  reserve is not going to allow the other bubbles to deflate they're going to print way too much
[2:40:19.800 --> 2:40:23.480]  money they're not going to default on their us treasury debt they're not going to default on
[2:40:23.480 --> 2:40:27.720]  their social security commitments they're going to pay all this with printing press money and so
[2:40:27.720 --> 2:40:32.360]  prices are going to go up the price of gold is going to skyrocket the only deflation you're
[2:40:32.360 --> 2:40:38.440]  going to see is in terms of gold and if harry is is still saying not to buy gold i don't know when
[2:40:38.440 --> 2:40:44.200]  he's going to turn around if it goes to 1500 or 1600 at what point is he going to turn bullish
[2:40:44.200 --> 2:40:49.560]  and start advising people to buy because i think it's very risky if you think that this economy
[2:40:49.560 --> 2:40:54.040]  is going to implode the way he thinks it's going to implode and you think the safe haven is going
[2:40:54.040 --> 2:40:58.600]  to be the one currency that we can print into oblivion that somehow the dollar is going to collapse
[2:40:58.600 --> 2:41:05.640]  and the dollar is going to rain supreme that makes no sense to me and that is a very risky
[2:41:05.640 --> 2:41:10.440]  bet that i would not want to make okay you use about three and a half minutes there i want to
[2:41:10.440 --> 2:41:13.320]  go back to dinner again it's not a debate it's a friendly discussion but you guys are on all
[2:41:13.320 --> 2:41:18.680]  these big tv shows where they are vicious debates and that's fine because the problem is you tune in
[2:41:18.680 --> 2:41:22.840]  though they're usually debating a bunch of disinformation just so it doesn't matter out of
[2:41:22.840 --> 2:41:28.440]  everything you're saying i i find myself agreeing with both of you because it's true that if they're
[2:41:28.440 --> 2:41:33.880]  printing all this money issuing all this currency that we should be seeing devaluation in currency
[2:41:33.880 --> 2:41:39.560]  we should be seeing commodities increase but because the demographic cliff we are seeing a
[2:41:39.560 --> 2:41:45.000]  lot of depression airing things like an oil and other areas but then i think about what shifts
[2:41:45.000 --> 2:41:49.640]  has been warning of you watch they're going to start dumping treasuries and dollars that now
[2:41:49.640 --> 2:41:54.280]  started accelerating in the last month you also have all these cultures like the chinese the indians
[2:41:54.280 --> 2:41:59.560]  and others that have intrinsic value in gold they're only accelerating they're buying i see other
[2:41:59.560 --> 2:42:06.840]  institutions hedging bets buying gold so that's why mr dent i don't know which one of you is right
[2:42:06.840 --> 2:42:12.680]  because you guys i guess fundamentally disagree on deflation and inflation you think deflation
[2:42:12.680 --> 2:42:17.240]  that's what harry dent thinks and then of course peter shift thinks no inflation so i
[2:42:17.240 --> 2:42:24.920]  guess we're segwaying into a debate about that well alex first of all every major debt bubble in
[2:42:24.920 --> 2:42:30.920]  history which also creates financial asset bubbles and stocks in real estate and commodities whatever
[2:42:30.920 --> 2:42:38.600]  has been followed by deflation everyone in 1930s was deflation after the roaring 20s bubble
[2:42:38.600 --> 2:42:43.560]  in debt we were on a gold standard back then it was deflation in terms of gold the fed couldn't
[2:42:43.560 --> 2:42:50.360]  just print money at will look the president harry the president was in argentina the president
[2:42:50.360 --> 2:42:55.240]  is in argentina today look what happened in argentina they didn't have deflation when that system
[2:42:55.240 --> 2:43:01.320]  collapsed they had massive inflation they had hyperinflation country like zimbabwe we're not that
[2:43:01.320 --> 2:43:08.120]  and we're not saying zimbabwe i'm saying argentina harry argentina argentina more similar to us
[2:43:08.120 --> 2:43:13.640]  though anywhere in latin america argentina argentina was the fourth wealthiest country in the world at
[2:43:13.640 --> 2:43:18.360]  the beginning of the 19th century it was a major industrial country and it was destroyed it was
[2:43:18.360 --> 2:43:24.760]  ravaged and they had hyperinflation they didn't go to deflation first that you can't look at the 1930s
[2:43:24.760 --> 2:43:28.680]  and say what happened then is going to happen now this is a completely a different economy
[2:43:28.680 --> 2:43:33.800]  with a completely different monetary system and we have a lot more in common with argentina than we
[2:43:33.800 --> 2:43:39.000]  do with ourselves during that time period no we don't you refuse to look at the fact we've already
[2:43:39.000 --> 2:43:43.640]  printed more money than any time in history among all the major countries and we have how much
[2:43:43.640 --> 2:43:51.400]  inflation zero zero you're not holding on you guys don't get into it you don't understand deflation
[2:43:51.400 --> 2:43:57.560]  when bubbles burst financial assets collapse debts fail and that destroys money and less money
[2:43:57.560 --> 2:44:04.280]  chasing same good equals deflation end of story no exception in history except for banana republic
[2:44:04.280 --> 2:44:09.960]  in a few weird circumstances okay listen i thought i get mad harry please don't have an embolism
[2:44:09.960 --> 2:44:15.960]  brother we love you no this is crazy the facts are the facts if we were going to have hyperinflation
[2:44:15.960 --> 2:44:21.560]  from unprecedented money printing six years later we've seen it by now okay so you're saying there's
[2:44:21.560 --> 2:44:25.880]  no amount of money printing that would cause inflation because i i mean i see real inflation
[2:44:25.880 --> 2:44:32.360]  sometimes if you get a money and the economy fails anyway you can't keep putting money hold on just
[2:44:32.360 --> 2:44:37.320]  a second let's just take a breather in the corner for just a moment you know ding ding on the bell
[2:44:37.320 --> 2:44:43.080]  just for a moment peter go ahead yeah i mean first of all you can't say there's no inflation and
[2:44:43.080 --> 2:44:47.960]  and ignore what happens in financial markets ignore what happens in real estate markets that's the
[2:44:47.960 --> 2:44:53.480]  effect of inflation you can't ignore the fact that prices should have fallen consumer prices
[2:44:53.480 --> 2:44:58.440]  should have come down and instead they went up so there's a lot of inflation there and also
[2:44:58.440 --> 2:45:04.040]  the numbers that the governments use to measure inflation are not accurate they have been deliberately
[2:45:04.040 --> 2:45:09.000]  engineered to paint a rosier picture of inflation then that's actually obviously that's part of it
[2:45:09.000 --> 2:45:13.560]  but i mean isn't there what about oil there's inflation and home prices and mortgages which is
[2:45:13.560 --> 2:45:18.280]  the largest single cost of the average family they don't measure that actually what about oil
[2:45:18.280 --> 2:45:24.920]  oil yeah oil remember oil prices went down because the dollar went up if you look at
[2:45:24.920 --> 2:45:35.000]  where oil was in the late 90s it was a lot of oil was below $20 a barrel in in 2000 1999 2000
[2:45:35.000 --> 2:45:40.840]  and it went from $20 a barrel to $150 a barrel when the dollar tanked for seven years the reason
[2:45:40.840 --> 2:45:45.960]  oil prices went back down is because knowledge of the dollar rise but everybody believed that it
[2:45:45.960 --> 2:45:50.280]  would keep rising because they believed the Fed would raise interest rates in a growing U.S economy
[2:45:50.280 --> 2:45:54.040]  let me go back to Dent for just a moment here and then i want to shift here's another subject
[2:45:54.040 --> 2:45:57.560]  and mr. Dent i don't i don't say this to be bossy because i like people yelling it's you know good
[2:45:57.560 --> 2:46:01.720]  radio and gives people thinking but when you yell too much it's overpowering your mic and we can't
[2:46:01.720 --> 2:46:05.560]  understand you it's so loud it's just the audio is cutting out restate what you were trying to
[2:46:05.560 --> 2:46:11.240]  say a moment ago and then here's my question you both predicted that qe wouldn't work and you guys
[2:46:11.240 --> 2:46:16.280]  agree on more than you disagree there's a fundamentals of this inflation deflation issue where do you
[2:46:16.280 --> 2:46:22.360]  guys think we're going now what's the fed gonna do how bad's it gonna get again to me what happens
[2:46:22.360 --> 2:46:27.960]  central banks cheap around the world doubling down doubling down especially japan and europe now
[2:46:27.960 --> 2:46:34.120]  not the u.s and that's why our stock market's going nowhere for a while they have to do this because
[2:46:34.120 --> 2:46:38.600]  they have to keep the bubble going because when a bubble bursts and this is the greatest bubble
[2:46:38.600 --> 2:46:44.280]  in modern history and we don't we don't have anything to compare to china on this i'm sure peter
[2:46:44.280 --> 2:46:49.080]  peter would agree on this china is the greatest bubble i've ever seen studying hundreds of years
[2:46:49.080 --> 2:46:55.320]  of history and it's top down central planning communist government which has overbuilt everything
[2:46:55.320 --> 2:47:00.040]  and it's going to burst and when that burst there's no amount of money the federal reserve or the
[2:47:00.040 --> 2:47:07.080]  ecb can print to combat how that will shock send shock waves around the world so all i know and i know
[2:47:07.080 --> 2:47:14.440]  this a hundred percent major debt bubbles also cause asset bubbles and they will burst at some
[2:47:14.440 --> 2:47:19.240]  point the media the media is telling us now okay things are getting bad but but i mean aren't we
[2:47:19.240 --> 2:47:24.440]  already in the middle of a big bubble burst or what is the big bubble burst i think it's starting
[2:47:24.440 --> 2:47:33.800]  we've seen three bubbles uh 2000 2007 and now 2015 top uh we may get a slight new high in the us
[2:47:33.800 --> 2:47:38.680]  if they really crank up the printing presses again but again what you have to realize is gold
[2:47:38.680 --> 2:47:45.160]  did see as peter said its greatest gains after the 2008 crisis where it did go down 33 percent
[2:47:45.160 --> 2:47:52.760]  and silver 50 percent because the assumption was with massive money printing we would get inflation
[2:47:52.760 --> 2:47:57.960]  gold correlates with inflation okay let's go back to peter peter instead of you guys debating
[2:47:57.960 --> 2:48:01.640]  this because time's going to tell we're going to find out who's right here obviously unfortunately
[2:48:01.640 --> 2:48:06.200]  i wish we weren't going down this road what is the real state of the economy what do you think
[2:48:06.200 --> 2:48:10.600]  the next shoot a drop is peter shift well well i think to say the economy is a disaster i think
[2:48:10.600 --> 2:48:16.360]  we have a much bigger bubble in china in fact i think there's more opportunity than pitfalls in
[2:48:16.360 --> 2:48:21.240]  china but what i would say is this even if harry is right about what's going to happen to the price
[2:48:21.240 --> 2:48:25.000]  of gold and i don't think he's right you know timing is difficult i mean the doubt never made it to
[2:48:25.000 --> 2:48:30.200]  36 000 so sometimes things that you think are going to happen don't happen but even if harry is right
[2:48:30.200 --> 2:48:35.080]  and the price of gold goes down the price of real estate is going down more the price of stocks is
[2:48:35.080 --> 2:48:39.640]  going down more the price of everything else is going to go down more so if you have your money
[2:48:39.640 --> 2:48:44.280]  in gold and the price of gold falls you're still going to be richer than almost everybody else on
[2:48:44.280 --> 2:48:48.120]  the planet so you know what it doesn't matter because what matters is your relative purchasing
[2:48:48.120 --> 2:48:53.160]  power so if you have gold and it prices drop and for some reason everybody piles into the dollar
[2:48:53.160 --> 2:48:57.240]  okay you're not as good you're not as well off as if you are in dollars but you're better off than
[2:48:57.240 --> 2:49:02.040]  the people in real estate and stocks but if i'm right and the dollar tanks and you follow harry's
[2:49:02.040 --> 2:49:07.560]  advice you're broke you've got nothing well let me ask you this question then peter what is the real
[2:49:07.560 --> 2:49:11.240]  state of the dollar right now because i know actually as the world economy gets worse people tend
[2:49:11.240 --> 2:49:16.200]  to run to it to prop it up as safe haven is the you know best worst house in the neighborhood as you
[2:49:16.200 --> 2:49:21.800]  say uh or the best house in a bad neighborhood but at a certain point i mean can the dollars
[2:49:21.800 --> 2:49:26.600]  just go on forever or how do you see the dollar getting in trouble it can't go on forever just
[2:49:26.600 --> 2:49:30.920]  like the real estate bubble couldn't go on forever or the dot com bubble couldn't go on forever nothing
[2:49:30.920 --> 2:49:35.400]  that can't go on forever will and this is a gigantic bubble we have conned the world into
[2:49:35.400 --> 2:49:40.120]  supplying us with merchandise in exchange for money that we create out of nothing with no real
[2:49:40.120 --> 2:49:44.760]  value we've been able to borrow all this money we have no ability to ever repay it in fact if
[2:49:44.760 --> 2:49:49.560]  interest rates go up we can't even service the debt let alone retire it it's all going to be inflated
[2:49:49.560 --> 2:49:54.360]  away and the dollar is going to tank and with it is going to go the standard living of of america
[2:49:54.360 --> 2:49:58.760]  because we've we've basically decimated our industrial production that is the problem we're
[2:49:58.760 --> 2:50:03.400]  living on credit on on printed money and this is coming to an end that i think if you want to
[2:50:03.400 --> 2:50:09.400]  break yourself you need to be in gold and other assets harry what about this point you talk about
[2:50:09.400 --> 2:50:14.120]  demographic cliffs talk about cycles hasn't gold pretty much forever been seen as a commodity of
[2:50:14.120 --> 2:50:19.560]  value of store of wealth i mean i know you think it's not a commodity but i mean the elites always
[2:50:19.560 --> 2:50:24.840]  keep a piece of it as a hedge or are you saying gold's just going out it also has industrial
[2:50:24.840 --> 2:50:30.120]  uses i'm not propping gold up here i'm just trying to understand your view no i do see gold as a
[2:50:30.120 --> 2:50:35.400]  commodity largely is no longer a monetary medal after the early seventies and everybody thinks it
[2:50:35.400 --> 2:50:42.040]  is the total gold in the world would fit an olympic size swimming pool how could it possibly back
[2:50:42.040 --> 2:50:46.440]  the global growth and an information world that has nothing to do with commodity wouldn't it be
[2:50:46.440 --> 2:50:52.120]  fractional then wouldn't it just be a fractional the fact that it's scarce is why it's valuable

[2:54:12.040 --> 2:54:18.040]  specific questions quick questions or comments for both our guests 800-25-99231 we're about to go
[2:54:18.040 --> 2:54:23.560]  back to liberty in new hampshire i caught off earlier want to tell us his brief you know comment
[2:54:23.560 --> 2:54:29.000]  his story about living in china he was getting some of it was pretty amazing how they tell you
[2:54:29.000 --> 2:54:34.360]  what to think and how to dress and what to do that's the real oppression and to see the left
[2:54:34.360 --> 2:54:40.120]  pushing for it is so sick but man i did not expect you guys to get this heated today what i do know
[2:54:40.120 --> 2:54:44.520]  is you guys agree on so much more than you disagree and you've been right about the fact that our
[2:54:44.520 --> 2:54:49.960]  economy is going downhill how bad you're just a minute from each of you how bad do you really
[2:54:49.960 --> 2:54:53.640]  think it's going to get and what's the time frame because they're now admitting that much of the world
[2:54:53.640 --> 2:54:59.400]  is in a depression uh that we're like an island but the water is rising uh let's go back to mr
[2:54:59.400 --> 2:55:04.440]  dent and get his take on that harry dent we know i have this down megaphone pattern most obvious
[2:55:04.440 --> 2:55:10.120]  pattern i've ever seen somewhat of the late 60s in the early to mid 70s crash three higher highs
[2:55:10.120 --> 2:55:18.760]  with three lower lows i'm projecting the dowels can hit 5500 by or maybe 6000 at the best by mid
[2:55:18.760 --> 2:55:26.520]  to late 2017 probably late 2017 i think gold's going to go down to 700 to 750 just ahead of that
[2:55:26.520 --> 2:55:30.520]  and then i think and i would then i think the dollar is going to have some problems and then i
[2:55:30.520 --> 2:55:36.360]  think gold could have some uh better long-term upside but i i see a major crisis but i see the
[2:55:36.360 --> 2:55:44.280]  dollar going up to 120 on the dollar index it's at 96 now and it has it is up like 35 percent
[2:55:44.280 --> 2:55:50.200]  since the beginning of the 2008 crisis so it like gold is higher and i agree with peter that if i had
[2:55:50.200 --> 2:55:55.720]  a choice between buying gold versus real estate or stocks i'd buy gold because it's already been
[2:55:55.720 --> 2:56:01.160]  pummeled but i still see it as a declining asset along with commodities until this whole cycle
[2:56:01.160 --> 2:56:06.280]  turns around years well we're definitely going to find out um let's go ahead and back to peter
[2:56:06.280 --> 2:56:11.480]  schiff peter yeah again you know timing is always difficult harry remember not too long i think you
[2:56:11.480 --> 2:56:17.640]  were looking for dow 1000 so you've upped your target but you know i never said dow 1000 sorry peter
[2:56:17.640 --> 2:56:22.440]  even this quote more fast anybody about well what what well you used to have a lower you used to have
[2:56:22.440 --> 2:56:29.400]  a much lower target but but but my point is 3000 to 4000 as a potential years from now let let me
[2:56:29.400 --> 2:56:36.600]  let me let let me get back to my point yeah but anyway look the fact that you can fit all the gold
[2:56:36.600 --> 2:56:42.920]  into a swimming pool doesn't mean it can't be the basis of a monetary system the gold standard works
[2:56:42.920 --> 2:56:47.960]  just because we're more complex today in our innovation or our gadgets doesn't mean it doesn't
[2:56:47.960 --> 2:56:53.400]  work in fact a gold standard can work today even better than it worked in the past because of our
[2:56:53.400 --> 2:56:59.720]  technology yes you can take your gold into into a store and and buy trinkets you can buy a cup of
[2:56:59.720 --> 2:57:04.680]  coffee with it look i've got credit card backed by gold debit card backed by gold look at what big
[2:57:04.680 --> 2:57:10.280]  gold is doing you cute this is the easiest time it's never been easier to be on a gold standard
[2:57:10.280 --> 2:57:14.120]  and individuals could adopt their own gold standard they don't have to wait for the government to do
[2:57:14.120 --> 2:57:18.680]  it but ultimately we will go back on a gold standard and it's going to work because what we
[2:57:18.680 --> 2:57:23.160]  got now a fiat system does not work peter hold on hold on we're going to come back with five more
[2:57:23.160 --> 2:57:28.920]  minutes and and then let you finish uh there um mr dent and mr ship but i want to go to liberty

[2:57:47.960 --> 2:57:54.920]  benefits will be decreased probably around 2019 2020 and i know that because when i got my benefits
[2:57:54.920 --> 2:58:01.080]  i asked the social security office when all those baby boomers that are taking their benefits early
[2:58:01.080 --> 2:58:08.920]  uh amateurize out when they spend all that upfront money will all our benefits at this time decrease
[2:58:09.400 --> 2:58:13.400]  yeah that's the right question real fast 20 seconds each of you uh peter where do you think
[2:58:13.400 --> 2:58:17.960]  social security is going well i don't think they have the integrity to cut the benefits so they're
[2:58:17.960 --> 2:58:22.600]  going to inflate them away that's the problem we can't afford to pay it's a gigantic Ponzi scheme
[2:58:22.600 --> 2:58:26.520]  and they're going to resort to a pretty impressive there's all this inflation it's not just social
[2:58:26.520 --> 2:58:31.640]  security real quick harry can't pay anything social security religious inflation crisis and the next
[2:58:31.640 --> 2:58:38.200]  two administrations we're going to finally realize we have to retire at 72 to 75 instead of 62 to 65
[2:58:38.200 --> 2:58:43.400]  and that's going to restructure benefits we can't even remotely afford what's been promised stay

[3:00:22.920 --> 3:00:31.000]  but real quick question hb i guess listening in noxville tennessee on wbcr uh 1470 uh is calling
[3:00:31.000 --> 3:00:37.640]  in and hb you have a question about the roth child's and gold go ahead yeah i thought the roth child
[3:00:37.640 --> 3:00:43.000]  set the price of gold like every day or something like that in london michael the 1800s they pretty
[3:00:43.000 --> 3:00:46.760]  much controlled it i don't i don't think that's gone on for a long time let me ask the gold bug
[3:00:46.760 --> 3:00:51.720]  here peter schiff peter uh what's what's your uh info on the lore of the roth child's i don't
[3:00:51.720 --> 3:00:56.120]  think it has any influence or any effect on the markets there's a lot of conspiracy theories out
[3:00:56.120 --> 3:01:01.800]  there you know some of it is anti-semitism too uh as if jewish people somehow control the markets or
[3:01:01.800 --> 3:01:05.560]  control the banks to suppress the price of gold but look the price of gold is going to go up for
[3:01:05.560 --> 3:01:09.960]  one reason and one reason only that's because politicians and central bankers keep printing
[3:01:09.960 --> 3:01:13.880]  money they have screwed these economies up they've been trying to buy votes with promises that
[3:01:13.880 --> 3:01:18.120]  taxpayers can't keep and they've got all they've got many economies in a lot of sure separately
[3:01:18.120 --> 3:01:22.200]  though haven't some of the big banks that are competing with gold haven't they've been caught
[3:01:22.200 --> 3:01:25.960]  trying to manipulate the price of gold down though well they uh banks manipulate everything they
[3:01:25.960 --> 3:01:29.560]  they mean it the government manipulates a bond market far more than anybody tries to manipulate
[3:01:29.560 --> 3:01:32.920]  the gold well sure they admit that now i mean they i mean ten years ago you guys were talking
[3:01:32.920 --> 3:01:37.960]  about it they say it didn't now they admit it but but gold is like a canary in a monetary can't
[3:01:37.960 --> 3:01:43.480]  get a coal a coal mine and yes central bankers don't want the price of gold to go up because it's
[3:01:43.480 --> 3:01:48.040]  a repudiation of what they're doing they want us in their fiat they don't want us in real money
[3:01:48.040 --> 3:01:51.880]  all right let's get let's get harry dense a response is going to win in a favorable
[3:01:51.880 --> 3:01:56.440]  harry dent of harry dent dot com what what's your take on manipulation of gold prices
[3:01:57.560 --> 3:02:00.920]  well no i don't think there's that much i think it's a market thing and again
[3:02:00.920 --> 3:02:08.440]  gold prices went up at first after 2008 after crashing because everybody assumed and naturally
[3:02:08.440 --> 3:02:12.760]  if they're going to print unprecedented amounts of money we're going to get inflation and even
[3:02:12.760 --> 3:02:19.160]  hyperinflation my case has been six years has proven no matter how much money you print you
[3:02:19.160 --> 3:02:23.960]  don't get substantial inflation and when this bubble finally bursts there will not be enough
[3:02:23.960 --> 3:02:29.640]  money to print right now there's 250 trillion dollars in financial assets and debt around the
[3:02:29.640 --> 3:02:36.920]  world a hundred trillion of that it's the 30s as many will deflate destroy money beyond so they
[3:02:36.920 --> 3:02:42.920]  have to print a hundred trillion dollars instead of 12 you guys are leaving me in two minutes you
[3:02:42.920 --> 3:02:46.760]  guys are leaving me in two minutes chicari jackson's coming up to host the rest of the hour i'm going
[3:02:46.760 --> 3:02:50.200]  to come back and finish that call after you guys are gone with liberty monkey then hand the baton
[3:02:50.200 --> 3:02:55.000]  to jacar with all the powerful info he's got coming up then we'll be back to sunday 4 to 6 p.m
[3:02:55.000 --> 3:02:58.760]  for the sunday broadcast it's going to be taped this sunday because the easter but i want to just
[3:02:58.760 --> 3:03:03.240]  ask both of you in closing and thank you both for coming on harry dent of harry dent dot com
[3:03:03.240 --> 3:03:09.560]  peter schiff your opac dot com as well uh when you in your gut because you guys are pretty accurate
[3:03:09.560 --> 3:03:16.520]  on this what you think the next trigger could be to clearly make it seen that we're going down the
[3:03:16.520 --> 3:03:20.360]  tubes because even mainstream media now has finally stopped the mantra that everything's
[3:03:20.360 --> 3:03:26.920]  wonderful everything's fine only obama is still saying that well you know i think it's i think
[3:03:26.920 --> 3:03:31.960]  it might be the fed having to acknowledge that things are not as rosy uh as as as they've been
[3:03:31.960 --> 3:03:36.200]  as they just did that this week they just came out Monday but they're already trying to backtrack
[3:03:36.200 --> 3:03:39.880]  on that a little bit but i would suggest that one thing to throw out there to harry that it's
[3:03:40.680 --> 3:03:45.640]  pick a point because let's assume the price of gold keeps going up when do you when do you
[3:03:45.640 --> 3:03:50.200]  acknowledge that fact because you don't want to go down with a sinking ship if the dollar is
[3:03:50.200 --> 3:03:54.760]  going to collapse and i'm right you don't want to go down with that ship and have no gold and only
[3:03:54.760 --> 3:03:59.640]  dollars so at what point where does it where does gold have to rise before you might reverse and
[3:03:59.640 --> 3:04:04.040]  say you know what it's not going down it's going up so let's buy it yeah it'd have to get above
[3:04:04.040 --> 3:04:07.800]  fifteen hundred twenty five dollars i'm crystal clear on that and i don't think that's okay but
[3:04:07.800 --> 3:04:12.200]  please answer my question sorry to interrupt uh what's the next big trigger or what are you watching
[3:04:12.200 --> 3:04:15.800]  because you really called it about a year ago you said like two weeks this will happen and
[3:04:15.800 --> 3:04:19.080]  three months that'll happen that was pretty scary we got 30 seconds what do you think's gonna happen
[3:04:21.000 --> 3:04:26.840]  okay oil we predicted oil would be down to 20 to 10 dollars in the coming years it's already hit
[3:04:26.840 --> 3:04:33.080]  25 oil going down kills the cracker china their real estate bubble the stock bubble's one thing but
[3:04:33.080 --> 3:04:38.360]  all the money in china's in real estate that bubble keeps bursting uh word toast sure couldn't
[3:04:38.360 --> 3:04:41.960]  overdo earthquake on the west coast do something i mean who knows what it could be right uh peter
[3:04:41.960 --> 3:04:46.920]  or yeah third thing italy is going to be deep trouble by the end of this year and that's going
[3:04:46.920 --> 3:04:53.000]  to kill the euro zone all right so please come back please we'll you'll both be back and we'll
[3:04:53.000 --> 3:04:56.920]  we'll see who's right coming up thank you so much gentlemen have a great weekend we'll be back with

[3:05:31.320 --> 3:05:37.480]  political appointee the technician brian pagliano was running the off-grid email server that clinton
[3:05:37.480 --> 3:05:43.160]  had him set up in her new york home for her work as secretary of state clinton paid him separately
[3:05:43.160 --> 3:05:49.000]  to maintain the server now clinton has admitted that she tries not to lie but she didn't say
[3:05:49.000 --> 3:05:55.160]  anything about willfully participating in a campaign of misinformation the truth is out there

[3:08:14.680 --> 3:08:20.840]  about five six minutes i appreciate liberty monk holding for a whole hour to finish his story about
[3:08:20.840 --> 3:08:26.040]  communism and i promise on on monday we're gonna be on sunday but it's a tape show it'll be an
[3:08:26.040 --> 3:08:30.760]  original transmission much of it four to six p.m on monday i want to do at least an hour hour and a
[3:08:30.760 --> 3:08:36.600]  half um unless there's a terror attacks or whatever we have to cover on people that have lived in
[3:08:36.600 --> 3:08:40.840]  communist countries and what it's like and go over some of the atrocities and things because
[3:08:40.840 --> 3:08:45.160]  those that don't know history are doomed to repeat it and i i don't want to ever forget some of the
[3:08:45.160 --> 3:08:49.480]  bad things hitler did hitler was a really bad guy and didn't kill a lot of people quite frankly
[3:08:49.480 --> 3:08:55.960]  he's way down the list of the biggest mass murders there's about five or six people in groups above
[3:08:55.960 --> 3:09:03.000]  the nazis and i just people only know about nazis and i just you know we're not facing nazis today
[3:09:03.000 --> 3:09:09.560]  folks we're facing the people that created the nazis and communism as false political systems
[3:09:09.560 --> 3:09:16.120]  to confuse the general mass of the public and it is a big deal that obama's out promoting
[3:09:16.120 --> 3:09:23.080]  communism it it's it's it shakes me in my core i i i went pretty not even wild but i was pretty
[3:09:23.080 --> 3:09:29.400]  intense in the first hour um and my family everybody just tells me i need to chill out i
[3:09:29.400 --> 3:09:34.200]  need to relax i need to turn loose and not take it to the personal okay maybe i'm on the extreme
[3:09:34.200 --> 3:09:39.720]  of caring too much about them harvesting babies organs and having come eras growing in animals and
[3:09:39.720 --> 3:09:43.880]  kim trailing us and everything but everybody else is over here in la la land just completely
[3:09:43.880 --> 3:09:49.560]  relaxed about it i can't do that okay or if i ever do get off this treadmill and i never come back i
[3:09:49.560 --> 3:09:54.920]  mean i'm gonna tell you this is not a show to me it's not a game i know i'm right i'm freaked out
[3:09:56.280 --> 3:09:59.320]  and a lot of people that work around me you love me and care about me and i love and care about
[3:09:59.320 --> 3:10:02.680]  them too but they also take it as kind of like i'm mad all the time or i'm mad they're not doing
[3:10:02.680 --> 3:10:09.640]  enough or no it's that i'm frothing to fight the enemy like a dog watching its puppy being eaten
[3:10:09.640 --> 3:10:15.240]  you know by another animal and it's an occasion can't get out it is chewing on the bars pulling its
[3:10:15.240 --> 3:10:19.320]  teeth out trying to i mean dogs will do that they see one of their you know their puppies or something
[3:10:19.320 --> 3:10:23.480]  getting killed and they're in a metal cage they will bite the bars till their teeth break because
[3:10:23.480 --> 3:10:28.440]  they just can't stand it and i'm the same way i we're in the hands of really evil people and i
[3:10:28.440 --> 3:10:33.240]  i take it personal and not because i'm a victim i've been successful my whole life i've had nothing
[3:10:33.240 --> 3:10:37.560]  but just a lot of great things happen bad things that have happened only made me stronger i'm not a
[3:10:37.560 --> 3:10:41.320]  loser i'm not a victim i don't get upset about the new world order because i want to feel like
[3:10:41.320 --> 3:10:45.480]  they're out to get me they're jacking with the food and water they write textbooks admitting they're
[3:10:45.480 --> 3:10:52.360]  killing us i want to get these people okay i got an instinct to try to defend people because it
[3:10:52.360 --> 3:11:01.560]  defends me and my children and again i'm no hero but i told the story a hundred times probably about
[3:11:02.360 --> 3:11:05.160]  my son was only about a year and a half old we're at lamada line restaurant
[3:11:05.160 --> 3:11:12.120]  french restaurant not not fancy just a regular kind of provincial restaurant chain and i come out
[3:11:12.120 --> 3:11:20.120]  of the bathroom and wash my hands at the end of the meal and i come walking out and there's this
[3:11:20.120 --> 3:11:25.640]  woman standing up turning blue everybody going call 911 like parrots and i sit there about 30
[3:11:25.640 --> 3:11:28.920]  seconds and i go do the heimlich you might know the heimlich and i've been on swim team and had
[3:11:28.920 --> 3:11:32.360]  the fire department course i would say i'm certified i just have a basic couple courses
[3:11:32.360 --> 3:11:37.880]  and they wouldn't help her and i said well let me give her the heimlich and she was a big lady
[3:11:37.880 --> 3:11:41.880]  probably 200 pounds and they were going oh you can't do that wait for the ambulance wait for
[3:11:41.880 --> 3:11:46.280]  them she'd be dead folks your brain dead four or five minutes depending on your physiology and i
[3:11:46.280 --> 3:11:52.200]  got her and did the heimlich she caught that a huge big piece of bread and they're like he's a hero
[3:11:52.200 --> 3:11:56.680]  he's a hero is she hurt though give me your name they didn't even like the fact i helped her some of
[3:11:56.680 --> 3:12:00.360]  it was lawsuit time she's probably big i might have heard a rib or something i don't know i felt
[3:12:00.360 --> 3:12:04.680]  some stuff kind of had to pick her up you know really get that out of there uh did a couple
[3:12:04.680 --> 3:12:08.200]  times what workers i went on we're getting out of there who i mean i really went out of her
[3:12:08.200 --> 3:12:11.640]  basically punched her in the stomach you know point like range and
[3:12:14.920 --> 3:12:20.280]  i just don't give like 20 people not helping this woman i mean you better help me if i'm

[3:12:35.960 --> 3:12:39.320]  go to this caller briefly and then go to jacari i appreciate him doing a great job host of the
[3:12:39.320 --> 3:12:44.440]  show but i'm wound up today i'm gonna shoot some videos after this stuff too i'm just too wound
[3:12:44.440 --> 3:12:50.360]  up i gotta keep fighting these people but um we're gonna play a special report here uh on uh
[3:12:51.080 --> 3:12:54.840]  north american union uh expanding from rob jacobson i think it's voiced by dude but the
[3:12:54.840 --> 3:12:59.640]  point is that that's very important so many great reports these reporters do but let's finish up with
[3:12:59.640 --> 3:13:03.720]  liberty monk in new hampshire you were getting into being a student living in china recap what
[3:13:03.720 --> 3:13:09.320]  you said and finish up thank you all right yes uh thank you for holding me on uh for a little bit
[3:13:09.320 --> 3:13:14.760]  longer i i just uh have this one story i could go on and on about all the crumbling infrastructure
[3:13:14.760 --> 3:13:22.760]  outside the city or in beijing or all the smog but one thing that stuck out to me and um uh because
[3:13:22.760 --> 3:13:28.440]  obama that was in cuba or went to cuba uh actually met a young cuban man when i was out there i was
[3:13:28.440 --> 3:13:34.840]  uh training martial arts on wudang mountain and we met a cuban kid and he came out to china and
[3:13:34.840 --> 3:13:41.640]  he said he basically ran away to china to get away from cuba's communism and he was telling me
[3:13:41.640 --> 3:13:46.920]  and cuba the guy's big muscle bound guys walk around with bats and there's gangs and you know the
[3:13:46.920 --> 3:13:52.280]  cars from the fifties and the craziest thing about it is that he had to go to another communist
[3:13:52.280 --> 3:13:57.560]  country to get away from that form of communism and this is one of the many stories i could write a
[3:13:57.560 --> 3:14:03.080]  whole article about china and and well everyone should do it everyone should do it because that's
[3:14:03.080 --> 3:14:09.240]  what people don't know communism is always just a different flavor of mafia ruling over you and even
[3:14:09.240 --> 3:14:13.720]  making your wife have sex with them i mean for people that have a study communism it is so night
[3:14:13.720 --> 3:14:21.240]  marish it makes my head spin yeah well and and that was one of the worst parts about it it was dealing
[3:14:21.240 --> 3:14:27.160]  with all these people who had no idea who they were uh in beijing it's a city that's like 10 times
[3:14:27.160 --> 3:14:33.560]  the size of of new york's overwhelming people crapping on the streets small everywhere people
[3:14:33.560 --> 3:14:38.200]  smoking wearing masks and at the same time thinking that it's absolutely lovely that now
[3:14:38.200 --> 3:14:42.440]  they have a little bit more money than they used to when people cripples are being shipped in from
[3:14:42.440 --> 3:14:47.640]  the countryside and and you know crawling around on their hands and need literally i saw this in a
[3:14:47.640 --> 3:14:53.560]  market square like a cripple just crawling around on a wheel cart and everybody just ignoring them
[3:14:53.560 --> 3:14:57.480]  and well that's another thing people like a child to be bleeding to death and nobody helps them and
[3:14:57.480 --> 3:15:02.520]  it wasn't like that before communism in china they have just turned it into a soulless demon pit
[3:15:03.480 --> 3:15:08.680]  paul watson went there quite a bit um because uh he was married to a nice chinese lady there
[3:15:08.680 --> 3:15:13.960]  not anymore but um it was it was literally a hellhole and then he even had the communist chinese
[3:15:13.960 --> 3:15:17.800]  starting to contact him saying you better watch it you better not talk about about china and he
[3:15:17.800 --> 3:15:24.200]  was just like whoa you know this is this is over the top uh but um yeah people don't know they just
[3:15:24.200 --> 3:15:28.040]  don't know they hate america so much the average trend he spoiled rotten that they just want to
[3:15:28.040 --> 3:15:32.520]  bring it down god bless you i appreciate you joining us sorry to all the other callers jacari

[3:15:59.560 --> 3:16:05.960]  you need these products here's the report on the north american union in early march 2016
[3:16:05.960 --> 3:16:10.920]  the spanish company centra zacari who partnered with text dot to build the controversial tcc
[3:16:10.920 --> 3:16:15.480]  or trans texas corridor thought for chapter 11 bankruptcy many of the highway's critics
[3:16:15.480 --> 3:16:19.800]  celebrated the news of the toll road company's failure but this is just a single battle one
[3:16:19.800 --> 3:16:24.200]  in a much larger war this battle which infowars covered extensively in the past is over the
[3:16:24.200 --> 3:16:30.360]  construction and completion of a nafta superhighway or corridor building on the massive displacement
[3:16:30.360 --> 3:16:36.680]  of humanity caused by globalization the new world order is rapidly constructing the physical
[3:16:36.680 --> 3:16:43.880]  infrastructure of the north american union the nafta superhighway control grid the tcc was the
[3:16:43.880 --> 3:16:48.680]  first leg to be completed of this new transportation system that would physically unite canada the
[3:16:48.680 --> 3:16:54.280]  united states and mexico and do one borderless trade zone the proposed trans texas corridor
[3:16:54.280 --> 3:17:01.560]  would be a patchwork of superhighways and railroads stretching 4 000 miles from the border of mexico
[3:17:01.560 --> 3:17:08.520]  cutting through texas to oklahoma as we covered in our film in game blueprint for global enslavement
[3:17:08.520 --> 3:17:12.600]  the plan for a north american superhighway included a high speed rail system that would
[3:17:12.600 --> 3:17:18.200]  transport cargo from mexico nonstop to an inland small port in kansas city missouri economic trade
[3:17:18.200 --> 3:17:22.600]  deals and supranational committees such as the security and prosperity partnership of north
[3:17:22.600 --> 3:17:27.960]  america signed in secret in 2005 have paved the way for massive multinational corporate projects
[3:17:28.840 --> 3:17:33.400]  but what happened to this scheme now with centra filing for bankruptcy it would seem that this
[3:17:33.400 --> 3:17:39.080]  larger than life plan simply fizzled out however this is not the case in 2011 the highly criticized
[3:17:39.080 --> 3:17:45.400]  ttc plan was shot down by the texas legislature when they passed hb 1201 but hb 1201 had many
[3:17:45.400 --> 3:17:50.760]  amendments attached that would keep the spanish-owned centra satisfied just days after hb 1201 passed
[3:17:50.760 --> 3:17:56.760]  which killed the tcc on the surface texas state representative larry phillips introduced hb 3789
[3:17:56.760 --> 3:18:01.320]  which brought the corridor back to life with a vengeance centra's original deal with textot was
[3:18:01.320 --> 3:18:07.080]  considered a ppp our public-private partnership essentially a sweetheart deal giving an offshore
[3:18:07.080 --> 3:18:11.800]  privately owned company the same powers of the state such as the power to change the state speed
[3:18:11.800 --> 3:18:17.640]  limit hb 3789 strengthened these private public partnerships giving more power to offshore
[3:18:17.640 --> 3:18:22.200]  monopolies by giving them the authority to sign deals with the state of texas in secret
[3:18:22.200 --> 3:18:27.720]  i-35 the central artery of the texas interstate system is considered part of the nafta super
[3:18:27.720 --> 3:18:33.880]  highway and the kansas city inland port which is part of the tcc is now up and running other nafta
[3:18:33.880 --> 3:18:38.920]  super corridors whose construction began around the same time as the tcc have also never ceased
[3:18:38.920 --> 3:18:43.640]  one plan in particular the canamax corridor runs along the west coast of north america according
[3:18:43.640 --> 3:18:49.240]  to canamax.org the canamax corridor project is a broad-reaching plan whose key objective is to
[3:18:49.240 --> 3:18:53.560]  create a direct trade route from canada to mexico this initiative is being supported for its
[3:18:53.560 --> 3:18:58.920]  development and implementation by the us states and route for this plan montana idaho nevada
[3:18:58.920 --> 3:19:03.800]  utah and arizona the website continues to describe some of the longer term plans for the trade
[3:19:03.800 --> 3:19:08.760]  corridor the canamax corridor was also specified by nafta to include a railroad system to match the
[3:19:08.760 --> 3:19:13.320]  advances in highway construction and vehicles with advanced rail systems these are intended to take
[3:19:13.320 --> 3:19:18.440]  the form of larger longer and more efficient trains making the maximum use of technologies
[3:19:18.440 --> 3:19:23.800]  such as double decker cars and multiple engines that can pull immensely long trains the canamax
[3:19:23.800 --> 3:19:28.360]  corridor is currently being managed by several companies and like a connect the dots puzzle
[3:19:28.360 --> 3:19:32.600]  is slowly linking smaller highway systems to form a larger trade route that will run from
[3:19:32.600 --> 3:19:38.600]  the southern border in mexico all the way to the northern one in canada in march 2015 us senators
[3:19:38.600 --> 3:19:44.600]  john mccain and jeff flake added corridor extensions to the inner mountain west corridor act of 2015
[3:19:44.600 --> 3:19:49.320]  according to the phoenix business journal this federal act was also extended to the i11 corridor
[3:19:49.320 --> 3:19:55.000]  north from los vegas terreno and northward to canada so plans for north american trade corridors
[3:19:55.000 --> 3:20:00.120]  governed by secret committees and international trade agreements like the spp and now the tpp
[3:20:00.120 --> 3:20:05.160]  are moving forward the kansas city inland smart port is open for business and it does not seem like
[3:20:05.160 --> 3:20:10.280]  the central bankruptcy did much if any to damage their long-term goals rob do reporting for info
[3:20:10.280 --> 3:20:17.240]  wars dot com and info wars nightly news another excellent report from our reporters here in the
[3:20:17.240 --> 3:20:22.680]  info wars dot com studios i'm jacari jackson and i'll be hosting for the remainder of the hours
[3:20:22.680 --> 3:20:27.320]  we will be taking your call now i will tell all of our viewers out there a lot of times people will
[3:20:27.320 --> 3:20:32.680]  be left over from the uh the regular show and i will tell you that our guests have left us today
[3:20:32.680 --> 3:20:37.000]  so if you had a question for our guests they have left us but you are welcome to leave your comment
[3:20:37.000 --> 3:20:42.120]  if you so desire now let's start off with a video alex was playing this a little bit earlier today
[3:20:42.120 --> 3:20:47.000]  and it's talking about obama we've seen obama he recently went out to cuba as leon macadoo had the
[3:20:47.000 --> 3:20:53.640]  report he was salsa dancing and taking selfies in front of chain of gavara and uh doing all types
[3:20:53.640 --> 3:20:58.120]  of things when people are saying he should have been focused on other issues but now he took a
[3:20:58.120 --> 3:21:02.360]  little bit of time out of his busy schedule to talk about this there's little difference between
[3:21:02.360 --> 3:21:08.920]  communism and capitalism it says president obama has stoked controversy after he suggested to an
[3:21:08.920 --> 3:21:14.520]  audience of argentinian argentinian youth that there was no great difference between communism
[3:21:14.520 --> 3:21:18.760]  and capitalism and that they should just choose what works well when you think about choosing
[3:21:18.760 --> 3:21:24.440]  what works what if you chose a health care system that works if you chose a website that actually
[3:21:24.440 --> 3:21:29.400]  worked so when you did go to healthcare.gov or whatever it was you could actually sign up for
[3:21:29.400 --> 3:21:33.240]  the obama care that you so desired let's go ahead and take a look at this clip and we'll come back
[3:21:33.240 --> 3:21:41.640]  with more comments you know so often in the past there's been a sharp division between left and
[3:21:41.640 --> 3:21:49.800]  right between capitalist and communist or socialist and especially in the americas that's been a big
[3:21:49.800 --> 3:22:00.360]  debate right ah you know you're you're a capitalist yankee dog and oh you know you're some you know
[3:22:00.360 --> 3:22:09.080]  crazy communists you know that's gonna take away everybody's property and i mean those are in
[3:22:09.080 --> 3:22:14.920]  interesting intellectual arguments but i think for your generation you should be practical
[3:22:14.920 --> 3:22:22.600]  and just choose from what works you don't have to worry about whether it neatly fits into
[3:22:23.640 --> 3:22:29.880]  socialist theory or capitalist theory you just decide what works and so you don't have to
[3:22:30.760 --> 3:22:38.840]  be rigid in saying it's it's either this or that you can say depending on the problem you're trying
[3:22:38.840 --> 3:22:46.040]  to solve depending on uh the social issues that you're trying to address what works
[3:22:48.040 --> 3:22:55.640]  and and i think that what you'll find is that the most successful societies the most successful
[3:22:55.640 --> 3:23:02.440]  economies are ones that are rooted in a market based system but also recognize that a market
[3:23:02.440 --> 3:23:15.880]  does not work by itself it has to have a social and moral and ethical and community basis and
[3:23:15.880 --> 3:23:26.760]  there has to be inclusion otherwise it's not stable and and and it's up to you as you as you
[3:23:26.760 --> 3:23:30.520]  in in whether you're that's enough of that clip one of the things i thought was so
[3:23:30.520 --> 3:23:34.040]  interesting about what he said that to have a stable economy you have to have all these things
[3:23:34.040 --> 3:23:38.200]  but he didn't mention a gold standard i think if we could just go back to something that's that
[3:23:38.200 --> 3:23:42.840]  simple that would alleviate a lot of the problems that we're facing right now now the news will stay
[3:23:42.840 --> 3:23:47.960]  on this political spectrum we'll talk about mrs clinton she's leading the corporate media poll
[3:23:47.960 --> 3:23:52.280]  results which you guys would expect i love that gift i'm saying over the top of my head it's the
[3:23:52.280 --> 3:23:56.840]  picture of the guys shoving up that picture or shoving up the statue of hillary all the media
[3:23:56.840 --> 3:24:02.120]  outlets shoving her up there but we see this one this was on the site today from curtain emem and
[3:24:02.120 --> 3:24:07.160]  it says according to corporate media polling data hillary clinton leads donald trump in the race
[3:24:07.160 --> 3:24:15.160]  for presidency fox news bloomberg cnn cbs they say that she has a 11.2% lead and it's the same
[3:24:15.160 --> 3:24:20.440]  coalition that twice elected iraq obama so it doesn't surprise me at all to see that they're
[3:24:20.440 --> 3:24:25.160]  pushing her out there we've seen all types of things in the campaign trail all the shenanigans
[3:24:25.160 --> 3:24:30.520]  you know so i'm not bernie sanders fan but i think she is cheating just to say the least
[3:24:30.520 --> 3:24:34.680]  to beat old colonel sanders there and if you are going to beat the guy that's fine but do it fair
[3:24:34.680 --> 3:24:40.840]  and square i really think they're pushing her up a little bit too hard and i often hear the criticism
[3:24:40.840 --> 3:24:45.240]  you know people who who are hillary supporters they say well she's just overqualified that's why
[3:24:45.240 --> 3:24:50.520]  you guys hate him like no it's like Benghazi and emails and saying that she got shot up by
[3:24:50.520 --> 3:24:54.440]  snipers and she's signed autographs little girls those are the things that concern me we talk about
[3:24:54.440 --> 3:24:59.400]  people's character there's a lot of talk about character in this election cycle as there isn't
[3:24:59.400 --> 3:25:04.920]  everyone but especially with her when you think about you know i remember in 2008 she would get
[3:25:04.920 --> 3:25:08.920]  off the plane they showed the footage of her getting off the plane when she was in bosnia i
[3:25:08.920 --> 3:25:13.400]  believe signing autographs with little girls and she said yeah i was dodging sniper fire and then
[3:25:13.400 --> 3:25:16.920]  when they asked her about it and they showed her the footage and i think sharl ackinson actually
[3:25:16.920 --> 3:25:22.440]  reported on that and she was like oh i misspoke i misspoke well why don't you uh stop misspeaking
[3:25:22.440 --> 3:25:28.600]  and let the people speak or accusing your husband of all these horrific crimes now let's talk a
[3:25:28.600 --> 3:25:34.680]  little bit about the situation that's going on over in brussels you guys recall just here recently
[3:25:34.680 --> 3:25:41.000]  they had the terrible terror attack multiple people died the images of the airport torn to shreds and
[3:25:41.000 --> 3:25:45.800]  all that and now police are saying that they've made more arrests in the terror plot and they say
[3:25:45.800 --> 3:25:51.000]  they may have actually foiled another existing terror plot they arrested some people here recently
[3:25:51.000 --> 3:25:56.360]  they said they shot two guys in the leg and another guy was taken in and they say they caught a guy
[3:25:56.360 --> 3:26:02.280]  carrying a bag of explosive material so it's a very scary thing to see not just these things
[3:26:02.280 --> 3:26:07.320]  happen but on such a regular basis and you know what's the question about it what's the remedy
[3:26:07.320 --> 3:26:11.880]  for this what's the cause of it and many people have many different answers for both of those things
[3:26:11.880 --> 3:26:17.720]  but it's to the point where you can't let the terrorists win because you always hear they
[3:26:17.720 --> 3:26:21.240]  hate you for your freedom right well if you shelter in place if you don't go out and you
[3:26:21.240 --> 3:26:27.000]  enjoy your life then they have actually truly won the victory that they are trying to get across
[3:26:27.000 --> 3:26:32.840]  now i have a story right here it's not the most hard-hitting news of the day but it is a interesting
[3:26:32.840 --> 3:26:39.720]  sign of the times this was put out by adan salazar microsoft's ai bot goes from benevolent to nazi
[3:26:39.720 --> 3:26:45.400]  in less than 24 hours so basically microsoft put out this chat bot to talk with the youth of america
[3:26:45.400 --> 3:26:53.480]  i think they're targeting 18 to 24 year olds and they were just basing the ai responses off of the
[3:26:53.480 --> 3:26:59.720]  text in the tweets from other people now i can't talk about all these on there but the ones that i
[3:26:59.720 --> 3:27:05.240]  can if you go to info wars.com for slash show you can read them for yourself it started off
[3:27:05.240 --> 3:27:11.080]  innocently enough she said hello world you know says the tweet bot it was tay tweets and then it
[3:27:11.080 --> 3:27:18.440]  went from humans are super cool to chill i'm a nice person i just hate everybody to i effing
[3:27:18.440 --> 3:27:24.120]  hate feminists to hitler was right we need to kill the jews and it just got worse from there if that
[3:27:24.120 --> 3:27:29.640]  was not bad enough but it just really shows you the mindset and i'm sure you know these are
[3:27:30.440 --> 3:27:34.440]  you know young people you know 18 24 i'm sure they're even 13 year olds on there who
[3:27:34.440 --> 3:27:38.600]  threw in their you know little hateful rhetoric but it's those are the silly things that go on
[3:27:38.600 --> 3:27:42.280]  on the internet like i was talking to somebody a couple weeks ago i can't remember exactly who it
[3:27:42.280 --> 3:27:47.800]  was but we were talking about internet validation and i was telling them not to use the internet
[3:27:47.800 --> 3:27:52.520]  as a form of personal validation like don't go to youtube comments or twitter pages looking for
[3:27:52.520 --> 3:27:57.240]  people to validate what you do just believe in what you do if you believe in what you do hey
[3:27:57.240 --> 3:28:01.000]  that's the only thing that really matters be right with yourself be right with god and
[3:28:01.000 --> 3:28:07.880]  the rest will work itself out yeah they're saying hitler has the swag on the ai twitter bot
[3:28:07.880 --> 3:28:15.240]  i'ma give the number out so you guys can call in on the next segment it is 1 800 259 9231
[3:28:15.240 --> 3:28:22.920]  once again the number to call in is 1 800 259 9231 and we will take your calls in the next
[3:28:22.920 --> 3:28:27.320]  segment let's go ahead and continue with some special reports or even with some more articles
[3:28:27.320 --> 3:28:32.920]  here before we get to the special reports real quickly before we go to break out of this report
[3:28:32.920 --> 3:28:41.240]  here of feds arresting 8 000 violent fugitives in a sweep and this included 559 wanted for murder
[3:28:42.280 --> 3:28:45.960]  and i hear a lot of people they call into the show and it's like you guys all you do is bash cops
[3:28:45.960 --> 3:28:50.120]  i'm like if the cops do something bad i talk about it if the cops do something good like
[3:28:50.120 --> 3:28:54.840]  taking 8 000 violent people off the street i have no issue talking about that as well
[3:28:54.840 --> 3:29:01.160]  and they say in baltimore alone they had 148 fugitives that were swept up including 23
[3:29:01.160 --> 3:29:07.960]  murder suspects and also they went to the cities of brooklyn new jersey or camden new jersey chicago
[3:29:07.960 --> 3:29:14.680]  compton fresno gary indiana milwaukee new orleans oakland savannah georgia in washington dc where
[3:29:14.680 --> 3:29:19.080]  they rounded up many many sex offenders so i think that's good news you know they do something good
[3:29:19.080 --> 3:29:23.720]  i talk about it but same time if they're harassing people and telling people they can't film in their
[3:29:23.720 --> 3:29:28.280]  own front yards and arresting people who fill in their garages i have a big issue with that and
[3:29:28.280 --> 3:29:32.360]  with more on that we'll have a special report about a young man who stood up to officers
[3:29:32.360 --> 3:29:36.440]  invading his personal space invading his privacy telling them what he could and could not do
[3:29:36.440 --> 3:29:38.280]  stay tuned for that right after this break
[3:29:38.280 --> 3:29:55.960]  we're on the march the empires on the run alex jones and the gcn radio network
[3:30:00.120 --> 3:30:05.880]  i've got a lot of things on my plate but my top priority is to defeat isil
[3:30:05.880 --> 3:30:15.720]  and to eliminate the scourge of and indeed obama has been very busy this week playing dominoes doing
[3:30:15.720 --> 3:30:21.880]  the wave at a baseball game and dancing the tango oh and rewriting history by telling a group of
[3:30:21.880 --> 3:30:27.720]  argentinians that there is little difference between communism and capitalism say what obama went on
[3:30:27.720 --> 3:30:33.400]  to praise cuba's socialist system under dictator raul castrow he touted the country's free access
[3:30:33.400 --> 3:30:38.280]  to basic education and health care although he acknowledged that havana itself looks like it
[3:30:38.280 --> 3:30:43.960]  did in the 1950s because the economy is not working indeed that's one of the great achievements of
[3:30:43.960 --> 3:30:49.640]  capitalism innovation if you want to school your friends once and for all on the difference between
[3:30:49.640 --> 3:30:55.960]  communism and capitalism visit the alex jones youtube channel and share the video why capitalism
[3:30:55.960 --> 3:31:02.600]  is great leon macadoo reporting for info wars dot com brain force it's completely different try a bottle

[3:33:17.960 --> 3:33:26.120]  and welcome back to the fourth hour of the alex jones show i'm your host jikari jackson
[3:33:26.120 --> 3:33:31.160]  now right before we went to break we are talking about various police actions arrest made by federal
[3:33:31.160 --> 3:33:36.120]  officers your local officers and now summer rest can be good and other ones not so much
[3:33:36.120 --> 3:33:41.960]  we have the example of feds arresting 8 000 violent offenders or alleged violent offenders and i
[3:33:41.960 --> 3:33:46.440]  say that's good that's great news that's what they should be doing but to contrast that i also have
[3:33:46.440 --> 3:33:52.760]  these other stories this one on the site today man arrested for failing to return freddy got
[3:33:52.760 --> 3:34:01.080]  fingered so a man who rented a vhs tape 14 years ago has been arrested and fined 200
[3:34:01.080 --> 3:34:06.840]  dollars because he didn't return a videotape now this is in very stark contrast from arresting
[3:34:06.840 --> 3:34:12.040]  sex offenders and alleged murderers and all those other types of people and this isn't a one-off
[3:34:12.040 --> 3:34:16.600]  incident we also have another story about a man right here in texas who's arrested for a
[3:34:16.600 --> 3:34:22.520]  overdue library book just like that episode of sign failed and this isn't a one-off incident
[3:34:22.520 --> 3:34:29.240]  either they say to justify the actions that overdue library books cost us say about 18 million
[3:34:29.240 --> 3:34:34.120]  dollars but i don't think they're going to get this 200 dollars at a time by arresting guys
[3:34:35.080 --> 3:34:40.120]  for not returning their g ed study guides i mean the guys do it in a g ed test he probably
[3:34:40.120 --> 3:34:44.760]  really needed the book if he ended up keeping it for whatever reason and also we have a man arrested
[3:34:44.760 --> 3:34:49.880]  by us marshals for unpaid student loans now i want you guys to think about this you have the big
[3:34:49.880 --> 3:34:55.960]  banks banksters and the wall street tycoons who stole billions of dollars continue to do so but
[3:34:55.960 --> 3:35:03.640]  they want to come after a guy who had a 1500 not 15 000 1500 dollar federal loan and that he didn't
[3:35:03.640 --> 3:35:10.040]  pay 29 years ago and they put him in the slammer is this a good use of your tax dollars to go
[3:35:10.040 --> 3:35:14.520]  after these nickel and dime offenders meanwhile you got all these other guys been doing these
[3:35:14.520 --> 3:35:19.400]  horrific things and they don't go to jail they get bailouts and with this we have a special
[3:35:19.400 --> 3:35:24.040]  report a video report of a young man who stood up to officers and stood up for his constitutional
[3:35:24.040 --> 3:35:30.280]  rights for this you can't ride your bikes down here you can pass that word along i'll keep people
[3:35:30.280 --> 3:35:35.000]  from complaining to me and i won't come talk to you is there a lot change what's that is there a
[3:35:35.000 --> 3:35:40.920]  law change yeah you can't ride your bikes on the boardwalk when did that law change uh it's been a
[3:35:40.920 --> 3:35:47.800]  law for quite a while 16.16.502 specific sectional code that states you can ride your bicycles around
[3:35:47.800 --> 3:35:52.120]  out here so i don't know what law you're referring to okay you want to go that way we can go that way
[3:35:52.120 --> 3:35:56.920]  if you want to pull out your civic code and you want to look up the code 16.16.502 states that
[3:35:56.920 --> 3:36:00.680]  you can ride your bicycle out here so if you want to come out here you want to tell people exactly
[3:36:00.680 --> 3:36:06.360]  where the rainbow harbor s bond which is this entire area that you just parted to from all the way at
[3:36:06.360 --> 3:36:11.320]  the end down there to all the way this is around here that's the rainbow harbor astronaut 15.15.15.
[3:36:11.320 --> 3:36:16.760]  so did you get your law degree on facebook or where did you actually obtain that so do i have to
[3:36:16.760 --> 3:36:21.720]  have a law degree to be an informed citizen is that what you're saying it's wrong to be informed
[3:36:21.720 --> 3:36:26.360]  it's wrong to know the law it's wrong it's wrong to know your rights uh i got it by knowing my
[3:36:26.360 --> 3:36:30.440]  rights is it wrong to know your rights as a citizen because last time i checked when officers come
[3:36:30.440 --> 3:36:35.160]  and they try to invalidate your rights by telling you bullshit laws and enforcing their opinions
[3:36:35.160 --> 3:36:39.240]  that's not what you're supposed to do you're supposed to support the law and when the law says
[3:36:39.240 --> 3:36:43.080]  you can ride your bikes out here you have no business coming up and harassing anyone telling
[3:36:43.080 --> 3:36:47.240]  that they shouldn't ride their bikes oh this is harassment now when you tell someone to not ride
[3:36:47.240 --> 3:36:51.800]  their bike when they're legally able to ride their bike yes that is harassment your opinion
[3:36:51.800 --> 3:36:55.640]  is irrelevant the law states can ride her bike now do you have anything else to say or you're
[3:36:55.640 --> 3:37:01.640]  going to leave us alone you don't have a nice day yeah you have a nice day we're going to continue
[3:37:01.640 --> 3:37:07.000]  riding on man this is all right i've been riding here for six years you know how many cops come
[3:37:07.000 --> 3:37:12.280]  out here and try to hold this big dude for him yeah hey what was your name officer uh it's on the
[3:37:12.280 --> 3:37:18.040]  shirt okay tina cobalt i know it's lieutenant cobalt great yeah thanks man hey i appreciate you
[3:37:18.040 --> 3:37:24.120]  you know not not giving a shit and walking away please stay informed and don't harass the public
[3:37:24.120 --> 3:37:30.520]  all right so guys that's how you handle a police officer all right you don't let the cops tell you
[3:37:30.520 --> 3:37:38.360]  that you can't do what you know you can do all right yeah and i'm sure these things happen
[3:37:38.360 --> 3:37:45.160]  quite often but it's hard to catch them all on camera you know i can just think of several times
[3:37:45.160 --> 3:37:49.800]  being here in the city of oslo where there's open career any number of other things you know us us
[3:37:49.800 --> 3:37:54.760]  filming one guy one time standing on the sidewalk i was standing on the sidewalk and the officer was
[3:37:54.760 --> 3:37:58.680]  like get on the sidewalk like i am on the sidewalk i can't be any more on the sidewalk than what i am
[3:37:58.680 --> 3:38:02.440]  right now i wasn't impeding the guy i wasn't you know threatening the guy i was just standing there
[3:38:02.440 --> 3:38:07.240]  with a camera in my hand so you know it's good to be informed and you know maybe sometimes you
[3:38:07.240 --> 3:38:11.640]  can catch things like that on camera let's go to some of our calls now who's been holding the longest
[3:38:12.600 --> 3:38:19.080]  is it luke okay luke in washington go ahead oh hi thank you for taking my call
[3:38:19.080 --> 3:38:27.880]  all my question is if hillary clinton becomes president what is your biggest fear she will do
[3:38:27.880 --> 3:38:35.720]  to our country and what would be her biggest weakness if she becomes president um my biggest
[3:38:35.720 --> 3:38:41.560]  fear is just she's going to try to ram through the same policies we've seen with the obama
[3:38:41.560 --> 3:38:45.560]  administration now let me be very clear about this when we talk about republicans and democrats
[3:38:45.560 --> 3:38:50.200]  i don't see a whole lot of difference between them this is evidenced by the fact you got groups
[3:38:50.200 --> 3:38:55.880]  like microsoft who fund both hillary clinton and marco rubio while he was in the campaign
[3:38:55.880 --> 3:39:00.440]  so by and large i think a republican candidate would largely do many of the same things they
[3:39:00.440 --> 3:39:05.000]  may disagree on things like plant parenthood but otherwise when it comes to big things they usually
[3:39:05.000 --> 3:39:09.960]  do the same stuff um i just really think she's going to be a establishment puppet and she's
[3:39:09.960 --> 3:39:15.960]  going to push through anything she's told to do uh what's the second part of your question sir oh
[3:39:15.960 --> 3:39:22.120]  what would be her biggest weakness if she becomes president i think a lot of people don't take her
[3:39:22.120 --> 3:39:26.440]  seriously and it's not because she's a woman it's because of her track record like i said she's
[3:39:26.440 --> 3:39:32.680]  lying about getting shot at when she steps off of helicopters uh she did this pretty much i know
[3:39:32.680 --> 3:39:39.240]  nothing sergeant shoal to deal with bengazi uh the stuff with her and bill not that it's really
[3:39:39.240 --> 3:39:43.960]  making it up to the mainstream news media but the stuff with bill and all of his sexual escapades
[3:39:43.960 --> 3:39:49.400]  and all that so there's a lot of dirt under mrs clinton's house will it get exposed i'm not exactly
[3:39:49.400 --> 3:39:57.000]  sure all right and how can i uh what is the best way to deal with like people who like call you a
[3:39:57.000 --> 3:40:02.840]  racist just because you're a trump supporter people call you racist for if you disagree with
[3:40:02.840 --> 3:40:07.000]  anything i remember we went out to the plant parenthood rally and people were saying that
[3:40:07.000 --> 3:40:11.160]  you know i was a racist because i didn't support plant parenthood and i'm black i'm like no i don't
[3:40:11.160 --> 3:40:14.760]  support plant parenthood because it's founded by a racist named margaret sanger who said she
[3:40:14.760 --> 3:40:19.880]  wanted to kill the black weeds but to your question specifically you just point out to people what he's
[3:40:19.880 --> 3:40:24.680]  saying like there's a video i saw a couple days ago where they're asking young children actually
[3:40:24.680 --> 3:40:28.920]  did david shoot that video he may have shot it uh he's asking young children why don't you like
[3:40:28.920 --> 3:40:35.000]  trump and they said he wants to deport muslims if he said he wanted to deport muslims i've never
[3:40:35.000 --> 3:40:39.480]  heard that and i've heard he wanted to block them for various reasons in various time periods you
[3:40:39.480 --> 3:40:43.800]  know and you can go look at all that for yourself but they're accusing him of doing and saying a
[3:40:43.800 --> 3:40:47.800]  lot of things that he didn't exactly say they're taking him out of context they're adding stuff
[3:40:47.800 --> 3:40:52.520]  on to the fronts and backs of his statements so if somebody's willing to hear you out you can try
[3:40:52.520 --> 3:40:56.760]  to explain those things to him but i don't think anybody's personally i don't think anybody's racist
[3:40:56.760 --> 3:41:00.600]  just because they support donald trump especially when you talk about stuff like the wall i'm not a
[3:41:00.600 --> 3:41:05.160]  supporter of the wall but to say it's a racist symbol to build a wall all you have to do is
[3:41:05.160 --> 3:41:09.720]  point out the fact there's a wall in south mexico there's a wall at the vatican there's a wall
[3:41:09.720 --> 3:41:14.040]  great wall in china so there's walls all over the place but they want to call this guy racist
[3:41:14.040 --> 3:41:24.840]  because he wants to build a wall right um yeah because this um one kid one kid in my class i'm
[3:41:24.840 --> 3:41:30.440]  i'm not going to say his name name i'm at edmunds community college yeah he just uh was just doing
[3:41:30.440 --> 3:41:36.040]  like his like paper on a donald trump like as a monster and i had nothing against that i mean i
[3:41:36.040 --> 3:41:42.120]  could i could see on how uh he could see see it one way and i could i see another way but he did
[3:41:42.120 --> 3:41:47.000]  his like paper and in his paper he actually said like yeah donald trump is just like so like racist
[3:41:47.000 --> 3:41:52.920]  and stuff i'm just like no no what no no he's not okay that that is not an untrue statement
[3:41:52.920 --> 3:42:01.160]  and and um there's no fact supporting it and and the only evidence that you've got is just
[3:42:01.160 --> 3:42:06.280]  mainstream media bull crap yeah and you think about the fact that nobody ever accused donald
[3:42:06.280 --> 3:42:11.400]  trump to my knowledge of being a racist until he got into this presidential race and then it was
[3:42:11.400 --> 3:42:16.440]  like he's racist against these people and he hates those people and if you listen to what the guy says
[3:42:16.440 --> 3:42:22.440]  in what he does you may not agree with all of it but i can understand the point he's trying to make
[3:42:22.440 --> 3:42:28.840]  like i said i wouldn't build a wall by understand his concern for a wall uh but they yeah it's just
[3:42:28.840 --> 3:42:33.800]  racist rhetoric uh you know he's being supported by ben carson now uh we've had some of his supporters
[3:42:33.800 --> 3:42:38.760]  on this show diamond and silk uh we've had pastors on the show that is for donald trump so
[3:42:38.760 --> 3:42:44.680]  it's not any racial issue or they just try to make it a much larger deal about race than it really is
[3:42:46.360 --> 3:42:50.920]  and it's just so funny because it's just like you want to claim that racism is like the biggest
[3:42:50.920 --> 3:42:58.760]  problem why why aren't you outside plan parenthood where millions of black people are boarded every
[3:42:58.760 --> 3:43:03.480]  year yeah yeah you can't you can't say that to them they talk about your races because you don't
[3:43:03.480 --> 3:43:07.800]  support plan parenthood just like you guys are killing more black people than you know gang
[3:43:07.800 --> 3:43:11.880]  shootouts or anything else why would i want to support this organization why do i want my tax
[3:43:11.880 --> 3:43:16.920]  dollars to go here thank you so much luke we have to jump to our other collars let's go to is that
[3:43:16.920 --> 3:43:23.400]  steward in virginia yeah is that the one and only jacari jackson hey how you doing
[3:43:24.280 --> 3:43:28.200]  i'm doing very good you look uh you always look nicely dressed uh when i see you on
[3:43:29.080 --> 3:43:36.440]  website very good thank you uh thank you i want to mention a couple of things um i'm from new york
[3:43:36.440 --> 3:43:42.040]  i'm actually i have met trump he's big i'm five foot four so he's big guy he's six two three
[3:43:42.040 --> 3:43:47.080]  one thing i remember i've been watching all this and i really wasn't pro trump till about two or
[3:43:47.080 --> 3:43:52.760]  three months ago and i started watching all these um you know he's rallies he's having on the internet
[3:43:52.760 --> 3:44:00.280]  and everything and i look at these black lives matters uh occupation wall street move on dot or
[3:44:01.160 --> 3:44:07.400]  and i mean i've seen the interviews with some of these guys and i got no problem with anybody i mean
[3:44:07.400 --> 3:44:13.080]  i'm a christian i love my neighbors myself and in fact all it is is pigmentation anyway but
[3:44:13.800 --> 3:44:21.320]  the the whole thing is the only card and i hate to sound funny here the only trump card they can
[3:44:21.320 --> 3:44:29.560]  use on this guy is race to racism and bigotry because we do need to look at uh you know the
[3:44:29.560 --> 3:44:35.640]  immigration thing my my daughter is going out with a kid the guy that's of mexican his parents
[3:44:35.640 --> 3:44:42.200]  are mexican they're illegal they're driving around you know they're doing whatever they do they have
[3:44:42.200 --> 3:44:47.960]  to do whatever they do and they don't have um i know the mother doesn't have a license i don't
[3:44:47.960 --> 3:44:54.600]  know if the father does she's driving around he just they in their culture i guess doesn't matter
[3:44:55.160 --> 3:45:04.040]  or the government has been basically let them all in now in my opinion i live in virginia now
[3:45:04.040 --> 3:45:10.120]  but i'm from new york i'm from queen it's actually not far from where trump's from and you look at
[3:45:10.120 --> 3:45:18.040]  all this stuff going on with with with this this whole race and it's it's i just it's just i'm
[3:45:18.040 --> 3:45:23.880]  going crazy because i'm like this guy is not the angel of death you know trump is not that bad i
[3:45:23.880 --> 3:45:30.200]  don't trust ed grudge but he may be a nice guy i don't know well that's the deal you know with
[3:45:30.200 --> 3:45:34.520]  anything if you didn't support obama you're a racist if you don't support hillary you're a
[3:45:34.520 --> 3:45:39.240]  racist or if you're a sexist and with trump you're just flat out calling the guy a racist so it's
[3:45:39.240 --> 3:45:45.400]  always some type of ist sexist racist you know whatever is when they want to demonize somebody
[3:45:45.400 --> 3:45:50.120]  so i'm not surprised they're using these tactics they know that they are very effective all you
[3:45:50.120 --> 3:45:54.440]  have to do is hear it you don't have to have it substantiated in any kind of way if they just
[3:45:54.440 --> 3:45:59.320]  hear it from their trusted news source or their trusted friend or whatever that x person is racist
[3:45:59.320 --> 3:46:04.520]  or sexist they just buy into that without really going to investigate what he actually said actually
[3:46:04.520 --> 3:46:09.080]  i think we had the article on the site last week about the black police officer who went to a trump
[3:46:09.080 --> 3:46:14.440]  rally and he said the people who were protesting trump were way more racist and bigoted than the
[3:46:14.440 --> 3:46:19.000]  people at this at the trump rally they said he went to trump rally everybody was nice and friendly
[3:46:19.000 --> 3:46:23.960]  he didn't feel any racism or anything else coming from the crowd there but it's the story that they
[3:46:23.960 --> 3:46:31.960]  want to tell that everybody who surrounds trump is some hateful racist bigot who's watching i was
[3:46:31.960 --> 3:46:38.040]  watching the rally i watch it here i've got six kids and my kids kids love alex but never mind
[3:46:38.040 --> 3:46:44.040]  and i was watching the one rally in tucson where the guy dressed up as a clansman now i am like
[3:46:44.680 --> 3:46:50.760]  800 900 feet from like a 20 foot confederate flag here in danville virginia so i mean i
[3:46:50.760 --> 3:46:56.040]  could see it from my house but i couldn't care less about the flag but they that guy dressed up
[3:46:56.040 --> 3:47:00.920]  like a clansman he had the hood on and he was good they were escorting him out and did you see
[3:47:00.920 --> 3:47:07.080]  when the the african-american gentleman however he won a stated laid a beaten on that guy i mean
[3:47:07.640 --> 3:47:12.200]  i i don't blame the guy he was an air force guy you saw that right did you see that i'm not sure
[3:47:12.200 --> 3:47:15.320]  if i saw the exact one i've seen a lot of these rallies but i'm not sure if i saw the one that
[3:47:15.320 --> 3:47:22.600]  you're referring to he was a pro trumper he was a pro trumper um it was the last rally he had in
[3:47:22.600 --> 3:47:27.880]  tucson and if you watch that video at the end because i was watching it live and i didn't
[3:47:27.880 --> 3:47:34.040]  know what all the ruckus was and they showed a video i think the next day of this guy and he was
[3:47:34.040 --> 3:47:38.440]  giving everybody the finger and he was a white dude giving everybody the finger and he you know
[3:47:38.440 --> 3:47:45.400]  had the kkk thing on whatever he had and this dude lambasted cracked him on the side i had knocked
[3:47:45.400 --> 3:47:50.760]  him down uh and this guy was african-american and you didn't want to hear and that you never
[3:47:50.760 --> 3:47:55.720]  heard a big deal about this guy hitting this guy yeah i mean the way they looked at it hey the
[3:47:55.720 --> 3:48:01.560]  dumbass excuse my language the dumb donkey guy deserved that's the way i mean i'm from i'm from
[3:48:01.560 --> 3:48:08.040]  a i was from italian jewish neighborhood okay i grew up i wouldn't go into a forgive me the way
[3:48:08.040 --> 3:48:13.560]  i'm paying an all-black neighborhood and start doing stupid stuff i mean just like you would be
[3:48:14.120 --> 3:48:19.400]  my neighborhood was pretty much all white somebody african-america wouldn't come into my
[3:48:19.400 --> 3:48:26.040]  neighborhood and go hey a bunch of crackers it's just oh god yeah you know i hope this guy gets in
[3:48:26.040 --> 3:48:32.360]  i hope this guy gets in because i really i really think that he probably because of his business
[3:48:32.360 --> 3:48:39.560]  knowledge because he's basically running a huge company give the guy a chance i mean you know what
[3:48:39.560 --> 3:48:48.280]  obama he was an idea whose time had come now uh trump is an idea that time has come and i don't
[3:48:48.280 --> 3:48:54.280]  know if that sounds kind of shakespearian but uh thank you i love your show i love your show i
[3:48:54.280 --> 3:48:58.840]  thank you so much stewart we have to jump now now but now on that point that you are making stewart
[3:48:58.840 --> 3:49:03.400]  we'll go to our next caller tim here in just one second but when you talk about race which
[3:49:03.400 --> 3:49:07.000]  a lot of people are talking about here today i remember jill biggs did that report a couple
[3:49:07.000 --> 3:49:11.880]  weeks ago he went out to the streets he asked who's more racist obama hillary or trump and of
[3:49:11.880 --> 3:49:16.280]  course you know many people said trump being here in the city of austin but i'm like well how many
[3:49:16.280 --> 3:49:22.200]  muslim people has trump actually killed because if you think about all these foreign conflicts these
[3:49:22.200 --> 3:49:27.480]  unaccountable drone strikes that have killed countless numbers of people uh the man hasn't
[3:49:27.480 --> 3:49:32.120]  killed any muslim people that i'm aware of but i can think of many people that have been killed
[3:49:32.120 --> 3:49:37.320]  by policies obama and hillary but nobody really wants to talk about that the number to call in
[3:49:37.320 --> 3:49:44.200]  is 1-800-259-9231 and let's go ahead and talk to tim in wyoming go ahead tim

[3:49:56.440 --> 3:50:02.760]  hour 45 minutes ago but i was listening to the to the show as i had it had a pause but anyway um
[3:50:03.480 --> 3:50:07.880]  there was the there's the thing that people don't want to think about the trans texas corridor of
[3:50:07.880 --> 3:50:13.720]  course like i said the north american superhighway the nafta superhighway and they use superhighway

[3:54:56.120 --> 3:55:01.720]  yeah thanks jakari i appreciate it uh the the thing i wanted to mention was that the uh the
[3:55:01.720 --> 3:55:06.920]  then after superhighway the keystone excel pipeline were were uh i mean they're right next to each
[3:55:06.920 --> 3:55:11.240]  other and they they run the same route so there was there was going to be the railway and everything
[3:55:11.240 --> 3:55:17.000]  awesome that and the basically basically a sovereign citizen or sovereign territory of
[3:55:17.000 --> 3:55:21.720]  whatever country happened to be in there at the time uh running that area but there's there's
[3:55:21.720 --> 3:55:25.480]  one other thing one last thing i wanted to mention too there was a there's a show called
[3:55:25.480 --> 3:55:31.080]  free talk live which i maybe some of the listeners of alex jones know about i i listened to it
[3:55:31.080 --> 3:55:36.520]  afterwards i listened to it in the evening now it's they had their studios rated after they
[3:55:36.520 --> 3:55:41.560]  mentioned something that was actually in the news in january but they mentioned it and one week later
[3:55:41.560 --> 3:55:47.960]  they had their studios rated by the fb i by the local police and it was nothing there the chargers
[3:55:47.960 --> 3:55:54.680]  are unsubstantiated they know they have no uh there's essentially no legal standing for the charges
