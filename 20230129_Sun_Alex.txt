[00:00.000 --> 00:26.560]  Infowars, tomorrow's news, today.
[00:26.560 --> 00:34.760]  Now, ladies and gentlemen, my job tonight is actually really easy, but it's a paradox
[00:34.760 --> 00:38.000]  because it's also extremely difficult.
[00:38.000 --> 00:43.880]  It's really easy because all I have to do is come on here and show you the video that
[00:43.880 --> 00:47.720]  has the establishment, the most afraid right now, show you the video that has the corrupt
[00:47.720 --> 00:53.080]  American media, the corrupt politicians, and big pharma so afraid right now, and that
[00:53.080 --> 01:02.120]  is the recent, most recent Project Veritas series of videos on the Pfizer executive bragging
[01:02.120 --> 01:12.280]  about how they knew COVID-19 came from a lab in Wuhan and insinuating that they, Pfizer,
[01:12.280 --> 01:20.200]  are doing similar, if not the exact same research with monkeys potentially right here in the
[01:20.200 --> 01:23.120]  United States of America.
[01:23.120 --> 01:30.120]  Now, as we predicted, this is barely getting any coverage at all on the mainstream news.
[01:30.120 --> 01:35.320]  In fact, as far as I could tell, and I can't claim that I was watching for the last 72
[01:35.320 --> 01:40.400]  hours, but let's just say I've been keeping a close eye on the cable news networks and
[01:40.400 --> 01:46.760]  the mainstream news, and the only show that covered this, I bet you can take a guess,
[01:46.760 --> 01:50.480]  on cable news was Tucker Carlson.
[01:50.480 --> 01:52.200]  That was it.
[01:52.200 --> 01:58.040]  Nothing else on Fox, and of course, nothing else on Pfizer Newsnet, Pfizer Newsnet 2, Pfizer
[01:58.040 --> 02:05.760]  Newsnet 3, Pfizer Newsnet 4, Pfizer Newsnet 5, Pfizer Newsnet 6, CNN, MSNBC, ABC News,
[02:05.760 --> 02:10.920]  CBS News, NBC News, I think you get the picture.
[02:10.920 --> 02:14.560]  So we'll just play some of the video, pretty easy, right?
[02:14.560 --> 02:21.720]  The hard part is how do we deal with the frustration of this, I mean, the FBI couldn't ask for
[02:21.720 --> 02:22.720]  better evidence.
[02:22.720 --> 02:26.640]  They wish they had effective agents as good as Project Veritas to get criminals admitting
[02:26.640 --> 02:29.240]  their crimes on tape like this.
[02:29.240 --> 02:30.240]  It's a gift.
[02:30.240 --> 02:32.840]  It's unbelievable, and nothing will be done.
[02:32.840 --> 02:34.720]  So how do we work through that frustration?
[02:34.720 --> 02:36.360]  But here's the video.
[02:36.360 --> 02:40.040]  This has big tech, big pharma, and the deep state scared.
[02:40.040 --> 02:42.880]  That's why they're banning it all over the Internet.
[02:42.880 --> 02:47.840]  The only place it's allowed to be on is Twitter, and let's just play some of this clip.
[02:47.840 --> 02:52.400]  Let's play some of the video that has the deep state, big pharma, and big tech shaken
[02:52.400 --> 02:53.400]  to their core.
[02:53.400 --> 02:58.560]  So that's one of the things they're considering, the future, maybe we could create new versions
[02:58.560 --> 03:00.560]  of the vaccines or things like that.
[03:00.560 --> 03:05.560]  Okay, so Pfizer ultimately is thinking about mutating COVID?
[03:05.560 --> 03:08.560]  Well, that is not what we say to the public.
[03:08.560 --> 03:09.560]  No.
[03:09.560 --> 03:13.440]  It's like, it was a fault that came up in a meeting, and we were like, why, why do we
[03:13.440 --> 03:14.440]  not?
[03:14.440 --> 03:15.440]  It was like, we're going to consider that.
[03:15.440 --> 03:16.440]  There will be more discussions.
[03:16.440 --> 03:17.440]  Okay.
[03:17.440 --> 03:18.440]  Exactly, actually.
[03:18.440 --> 03:19.440]  Like, we're like, wait a minute.
[03:19.440 --> 03:21.200]  Like, people won't like that.
[03:21.200 --> 03:22.200]  That's right.
[03:22.200 --> 03:27.240]  It appears that Pfizer is internally discussing the possibility of mutating the COVID virus
[03:27.240 --> 03:31.960]  themselves in order to tailor a vaccine to sell to the public.
[03:31.960 --> 03:37.920]  Listen to Walker describe in detail just how they would conduct such a scientific experiment.
[03:37.920 --> 03:42.920]  So, the way that we're thinking about it, don't tell anyone the story, you got to tell
[03:42.920 --> 03:43.920]  us.
[03:43.920 --> 03:44.920]  You got to tell us.
[03:44.920 --> 03:45.920]  You got to tell us.
[03:45.920 --> 03:46.920]  Okay, right.
[03:46.920 --> 03:53.280]  So, the way our work is like, we put them in the virus, in these monkeys, and then we
[03:53.280 --> 03:57.920]  successively, like, cause them to keep infecting each other, and we pull out serals from them
[03:57.920 --> 03:58.920]  and then we...
[03:58.920 --> 04:04.880]  He's explaining gain of function research, ladies and gentlemen, and this video has been
[04:04.880 --> 04:09.360]  taken down from YouTube, obviously the question would be, if there's anybody interested in
[04:09.360 --> 04:16.720]  doing a real investigation here, who contacted YouTube or who at YouTube made the decision
[04:16.720 --> 04:20.120]  to pull this video down, instead of sharing it with law enforcement.
[04:20.120 --> 04:23.880]  Now, we already have, in fact, it gets buried now.
[04:23.880 --> 04:28.280]  The news cycle is so insane that the Twitter files are just getting buried now, and if
[04:28.280 --> 04:32.600]  it wasn't for Matt Taibbi going and doing Fox News interviews and Elon Musk trying to
[04:32.600 --> 04:36.840]  get attention to this with his Twitter account, there would barely be anybody reading these
[04:36.840 --> 04:42.240]  Twitter files, exposing how the government was using Big Tech to censor Americans.
[04:42.240 --> 04:47.560]  And so, now we need to have an investigation to find out, thanks to the blueprint we've
[04:47.560 --> 04:51.640]  seen with the Twitter files of how the government goes around the First Amendment to use Big
[04:51.640 --> 04:57.600]  Tech to censor you, what happened at YouTube, who ordered YouTube to take down this project
[04:57.600 --> 05:02.000]  Veritas video.
[05:02.000 --> 05:11.000]  Hey, what's up, bone?
[05:11.000 --> 05:12.000]  Hey, McBreen.
[05:12.000 --> 05:13.000]  What's going on, man?
[05:13.000 --> 05:14.000]  I see.
[05:14.000 --> 05:17.280]  Hey, really like that work you did on the AI piece?
[05:17.280 --> 05:18.720]  I'm going to use that on the show today.
[05:18.720 --> 05:19.720]  No, no, I worked hard on that.
[05:19.720 --> 05:20.720]  Yeah.
[05:20.720 --> 05:23.240]  I'm working on another project, so I'm going to be up late again tonight, and I was hoping
[05:23.240 --> 05:25.240]  you had some Brain Force Plus.
[05:25.240 --> 05:28.240]  Oh, um, no.
[05:28.240 --> 05:31.040]  No, nothing, no.
[05:31.040 --> 05:34.040]  What about Brain Force Ultra?
[05:34.040 --> 05:36.040]  Um, no.
[05:36.040 --> 05:38.040]  Hmm, okay.
[05:38.040 --> 05:39.040]  Yeah.
[05:39.040 --> 05:40.040]  Thanks anyway.
[05:40.040 --> 05:41.040]  Yeah.
[05:41.040 --> 05:49.400]  Good luck with that project, though.
[05:49.400 --> 06:08.360]  That's it for this episode of Brain Force Plus and Brain Force Ultra, right now at
[06:08.360 --> 06:20.220]  just a minute and 10 minutes, Bob Casting live from the UN Stronghold, Austin, Texas.
[06:20.220 --> 06:28.480]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show, and now your host Owen Troyer.
[06:28.480 --> 06:34.480]  An honor and a privilege to spend this Sunday, January 29th, 2023 with you here on the Alex
[06:34.480 --> 06:35.480]  Jones Show.
[06:35.480 --> 06:43.480]  There's a lot of developing news dealing with the situation in Ukraine and now we were concerned
[06:43.480 --> 06:48.680]  the Biden administration would try to use a war with Russia to distract from all of the Biden
[06:48.680 --> 06:55.720]  crime family details coming to light. It looks like they're now just going pedal to the metal
[06:57.240 --> 07:03.480]  where Saturday it was a rumor that the Biden administration it was just oh it was just a
[07:03.480 --> 07:09.160]  rumor oh there were talks about the Biden administration sending fighter jets over to
[07:09.160 --> 07:15.560]  Ukraine and then this morning it was reported as fact that they are indeed having those talks
[07:16.760 --> 07:21.880]  that was reported on Fox News this morning so well it's just a rumor to okay yeah they are
[07:21.880 --> 07:25.640]  having the talk so I guess let me you know the next phase of this right do I have to tell you
[07:25.640 --> 07:31.160]  what comes next oh it's a rumor they may send some fighter jets to Ukraine I mean obviously that's
[07:31.160 --> 07:36.440]  ridiculous they wouldn't really do that it's just a rumor well yeah okay well they are talking about
[07:36.440 --> 07:43.800]  the sending the fighter jets now oh oh yep fighter jets are sent oh and of course it was what eight
[07:43.800 --> 07:49.640]  months ago or so Joe Biden said there'll be no tanks there'll be no jets that would mean World War
[07:49.640 --> 07:56.920]  III oh now he's doing that as all of the crimes he and his family members have committed are starting
[07:56.920 --> 08:03.640]  to come to light that's you know potential World War III not even the biggest story today
[08:05.560 --> 08:10.680]  no it has to be because look if World War III happens and and it's bad what's going on in
[08:10.680 --> 08:15.000]  Ukraine and there are people dying I don't want to be involved with that I don't want to I don't
[08:15.000 --> 08:20.040]  want to be involved in the propaganda that'll make that worse so that that is a serious thing
[08:20.040 --> 08:27.880]  and and if if Biden continues to escalate that situation it will get worse but no right now
[08:27.880 --> 08:36.840]  the big story is these COVID vaccines killing people as the numbers just continue to go up
[08:36.840 --> 08:49.560]  up and the fact that YouTube is under orders right now to censor project Veritas videos
[08:49.560 --> 08:54.200]  exposing that Pfizer executive admitting all the things that we knew were true
[08:56.840 --> 09:02.200]  like COVID-19 came out of a lab in Wuhan where they were doing gain of function research
[09:02.200 --> 09:07.640]  and now Pfizer is considering doing gain of function research or potentially already doing it
[09:07.640 --> 09:15.080]  themselves so that they can have vaccines for the future now a lot of people won't understand
[09:17.000 --> 09:23.640]  why that is and what's actually going on including Jordan Tristan Walker who knows how
[09:23.640 --> 09:28.920]  qualified this guy really is and I'm not I'm not saying that as an insult I mean it I mean
[09:28.920 --> 09:34.600]  does that guy seem qualified based on what you've seen that guy seems like an unhinged lunatic
[09:35.640 --> 09:42.600]  I'm just a liar I'm just a liar literally I'm just a liar which is what he was coached to say
[09:42.600 --> 09:48.360]  by the way because of the timeline we have with the response and these videos
[09:49.560 --> 09:53.240]  Pfizer got clued in and and look I I'm not going to say all the stuff from behind the
[09:53.240 --> 09:58.840]  scenes with project Veritas and I don't want to tip any hands here but Pfizer obviously
[09:58.840 --> 10:06.520]  knew this was coming somehow some way and they told either Jordan specifically or just in a
[10:06.520 --> 10:10.680]  general sense they told their employees if you ever get in a moment like this just say you're a
[10:10.680 --> 10:16.120]  liar just boom so as soon as he realized what was going on you notice he went right into his
[10:16.120 --> 10:22.760]  conniption fits I'm a liar I'm a liar I'm a liar so hey you know what good for Pfizer they made
[10:22.760 --> 10:32.520]  a diversity hire oops how'd that one work for you e the Jordan Tristan Walker diversity hire
[10:37.560 --> 10:47.800]  nice way to go now I said this before Walker's only way out of this now is to come out as a
[10:47.800 --> 10:52.440]  whistleblower and he might not even be smart enough to do that that's why it's like dude if
[10:52.440 --> 10:56.440]  you're not smart enough to realize what situation you're in right now and come out as a whistleblower
[10:56.440 --> 11:00.840]  then then how are you even smart enough to even have that job to begin with and just based off of
[11:00.840 --> 11:07.560]  your needs your hysterical reactions my guess is you were never qualified for this job ever but
[11:07.560 --> 11:14.680]  you're a nice minion you're a nice lemming you're a nice stooge maybe even you know you're not really
[11:14.680 --> 11:23.640]  qualified so you took the job and you became a yes man and the rest of the story is history
[11:24.520 --> 11:31.240]  so one cable news show over the entire weekend covered this and that was Tucker Carlson one
[11:32.280 --> 11:41.160]  uno so you're talking about one percent of weekend cable news starting on Friday
[11:41.160 --> 11:46.280]  really starting on Thursday after the video first came out on Wednesday covering this
[11:47.960 --> 11:52.040]  of course you've got info wars of course you've got banned out video and all the great hosts there
[11:53.400 --> 11:57.160]  and commentators there and you've got twitter which is allowing project veritas to still
[11:57.160 --> 12:00.600]  operate and share its videos where it's been seen over 20 million times
[12:02.840 --> 12:09.000]  but now the frustration where are the investigations where are the congressional
[12:09.000 --> 12:15.000]  hearings where I mean of course why isn't the American media up in arms about this we know why
[12:15.000 --> 12:20.840]  Pfizer owns the mainstream media with their billion dollars in marketing why isn't our congress
[12:20.840 --> 12:25.400]  up in arms about this we know why because Pfizer owns our congress with billions of dollars of
[12:25.400 --> 12:34.040]  campaign donations the answers here are simple you just see the world for what it is you are
[12:34.040 --> 12:40.440]  just enlightened informed and curious enough to find this information and care about the planet you
[12:40.440 --> 12:47.880]  live on and the future unlike I suppose Jordan Tristan Walker who thinks it's funny to mutate
[12:47.880 --> 12:52.760]  viruses in a lab but but see let me get back to the point that I got off track on the layman
[12:52.760 --> 12:56.840]  wouldn't even understand this I only understand this because I talked to doctors like Dr Peter
[12:56.840 --> 13:01.240]  McCullough who's going to be in studio with us on Tuesday I only understand this because I talked to
[13:01.240 --> 13:05.880]  doctors and I hear other doctors on other talk shows and everything why would they
[13:06.600 --> 13:11.960]  mutate a virus in a lab to get a vaccine because folks if you understand this then the
[13:11.960 --> 13:18.760]  entire vaccine industry maybe not the entire vaccine industry but most of the vaccine industry
[13:18.760 --> 13:24.840]  is defunct you'll never get another flu vaccine you'll never get another COVID vaccine and you'll
[13:24.840 --> 13:31.640]  realize most of these vaccines are totally worthless why do they mutate a virus to get a
[13:31.640 --> 13:37.480]  future vaccine because by the time their flu vaccine use the flu vaccine as as the example
[13:37.480 --> 13:44.440]  might be the best example by the time their flu vaccine hits the market the flu virus that it's
[13:44.440 --> 13:50.280]  vaccinating you for has already mutated and the vaccine is totally defunct and they know that
[13:50.280 --> 13:59.160]  they know that and they still put it into your arms every year a vaccine that they know is defunct
[13:59.160 --> 14:04.920]  a vaccine that they know will not stop the flu as they say it will because the flu virus has
[14:04.920 --> 14:11.000]  already mutated past the evolutionary stage of the vaccine that they just put to market same thing
[14:11.000 --> 14:20.520]  with COVID whoa whoa how much money do these companies make off their flu vaccines or other
[14:20.520 --> 14:26.040]  other virus vaccines or vaccines like this where by the time the vaccine hits the market whatever
[14:26.040 --> 14:32.840]  it is is already mutated meaning they're selling you a vaccine they know doesn't work if I they
[14:32.840 --> 14:39.880]  don't even let Amish sell milk but if I sell you milk that is expired that's a crime if I if I sell
[14:39.880 --> 14:46.360]  you perishable food that's expired you can't do that that's illegal but big pharma can sell you
[14:46.360 --> 14:52.920]  what is essentially the equivalent of an expired vaccine and that's what they do so that's why
[14:52.920 --> 14:58.360]  this is another reason why this video is so huge so when you understand the context they admit they
[14:58.360 --> 15:03.480]  know the vaccines don't work when they sell them to you they know that the virus came out of the
[15:03.480 --> 15:10.760]  Wuhan lab from gain of function research that they're now doing in a Pfizer lab or potentially
[15:10.760 --> 15:16.520]  could be doing in a Pfizer lab right here in the United States of America now I'm going to connect
[15:16.520 --> 15:23.080]  all this when we come back to another story of other undercover video not from Project Veritas
[15:23.800 --> 15:31.960]  of leftist educators bragging about how they deceive parents and knowingly rename critical
[15:31.960 --> 15:39.240]  race theory to other different words phrases what have you so that the parents don't know
[15:39.240 --> 15:45.800]  we're still teaching it and they laugh and they yes they grit their teeth about how they're deceiving
[15:45.800 --> 15:52.040]  you folks this is the entire psychology of the left this is why it's so dangerous and it's the
[15:52.040 --> 15:57.400]  exact same thing you saw in that Pfizer video laughing about lying to you about gain of function
[15:57.400 --> 16:07.880]  research the cavalry has arrived ultimate bone broth is the strongest highest quality chicken

[20:29.320 --> 20:39.640]  headline info wars.com youtube banned this project veritas video that exposed
[20:39.640 --> 20:45.960]  visor's gain of function virus work watch the censored project veritas video visor does not
[20:45.960 --> 20:53.160]  want you to see and be sure to share it with friends and family and it's on twitter still
[20:53.160 --> 21:00.200]  available there we have uploaded it to band.video as well and of course the good folks at project
[21:00.200 --> 21:09.560]  veritas are like us in that we are free to air in fact james oakief came up with the word distribution
[21:09.560 --> 21:16.520]  by proxy which is what you are now you are now the proxies of truth you are now the proxies of
[21:16.520 --> 21:25.400]  information you are now the proxies of veritas so as this video was going massively viral it's
[21:26.680 --> 21:31.000]  easily been seen a hundred million times all things considered but the numbers on twitter
[21:31.000 --> 21:40.440]  alone have it at just shy of 30 million views last i checked but youtube of course now still run by
[21:40.440 --> 21:49.400]  the deep state swamp american left is censoring the video james oakief announces this breaking youtube
[21:49.400 --> 21:56.520]  has taken down our fiser directed evolution bombshell it had 800 000 views video still exists
[21:56.520 --> 22:03.080]  on twitter with since this post it's more i'm gonna say 30 million views fiser is scrambling today
[22:03.080 --> 22:12.680]  per sources inside how does youtube how much does youtube cost elon musk and so other big
[22:12.680 --> 22:19.320]  accounts on twitter like kim dot com sharing this story as well and guys just for curiosity's sake
[22:19.880 --> 22:29.080]  what is the current number on the project veritas video upload from january 25th on twitter this
[22:29.080 --> 22:36.120]  is the one with the fiser employee sitting at dinner on the grinder date and admitting the
[22:36.120 --> 22:43.880]  directed evolution concept that they may be doing or thinking about doing how they knew the virus
[22:43.880 --> 22:53.320]  came out of the wuhan lab from gain of function research amongst other things so the questions
[22:53.320 --> 23:01.880]  are obvious then who contacted youtube to take the video down is it fiser that has that poll over
[23:01.880 --> 23:11.160]  youtube or was it an agent of the u.s government whether it be fbi or directly from the white house
[23:12.120 --> 23:21.320]  who made the call who made the call and so i don't know if they could put it on the screen but
[23:21.320 --> 23:29.400]  the last i saw the video was at 25 million views on twitter alone and so yeah it's just it's just
[23:29.400 --> 23:39.960]  up over 25 million views and that's just on the one original post from project veritas but okay what
[23:39.960 --> 23:47.640]  is the real issue here that is that that we're facing right now and that's the covid vaccines
[23:47.640 --> 23:53.800]  and killing people and so really you just kind of get a little insight into the type of scum
[23:53.800 --> 24:00.920]  that gets decompartmentalized and works for fiser and again you know part of me kind of feels bad
[24:00.920 --> 24:08.200]  for jordan tristan walker because clearly the guy was in way over his head probably never even belonged
[24:08.200 --> 24:12.760]  in the position he in fact no he definitely didn't just you can tell from his morals alone either
[24:12.760 --> 24:18.920]  because he's literally a liar his own words or because he thinks the stuff that he does at work
[24:18.920 --> 24:23.720]  is funny even though he knows it's evil via his own admissions from the ever undercover videos
[24:23.720 --> 24:29.800]  so jordan walker's only path to redemption now is to come out as a whistleblower and and you
[24:29.800 --> 24:35.240]  know i hope he sees the light i hope he sees the light because you can see in these videos this
[24:35.240 --> 24:42.760]  is a very unhealthy spiritual spiritually this is a sick person morally this person is bankrupt and
[24:42.760 --> 24:46.360]  there is a path to redemption for him and it's right there in front of him maybe he's not even
[24:46.360 --> 24:53.560]  smart enough to take it but aside from the craziness and the full expose into fiser thanks
[24:53.560 --> 24:58.600]  for these videos what's the real story we're facing right now that the covid 19 vaccines
[24:58.600 --> 25:07.240]  have killed at least 50 000 americans that we know of that we know of other
[25:08.440 --> 25:13.880]  individuals that do data analytics and insurance numbers and death toll numbers and all of this
[25:13.880 --> 25:20.120]  other stuff they think the number is actually somewhere around 300 000 americans have died
[25:20.120 --> 25:25.400]  from the covid 19 vaccine now you hear about it when it's a football player or a famous soccer
[25:25.400 --> 25:32.520]  player or a young hockey player because there's a there's a system of record there where you can
[25:32.520 --> 25:37.320]  go find oh this high school hockey player died or oh this professional football player died but
[25:38.120 --> 25:45.400]  you know the the mom that that is a secretary at the school or the the man who works at them
[25:45.400 --> 25:49.080]  is a mechanic at the car shop you're not going to hear about these ones they're just going to be
[25:49.080 --> 25:57.720]  heart attacks they're just going to be aneurysms and my heart breaks vance murphy vance murphy is
[25:57.720 --> 26:07.080]  reporting quote just got my last booster f the haters and this is from a lindsey leno on her
[26:07.080 --> 26:16.040]  facebook account here on her social media account and now she has passed of a cardiac arrest
[26:16.040 --> 26:25.720]  so i i don't i don't really my heart breaks for lindsey leno lindsey leno didn't deserve to die
[26:26.680 --> 26:31.400]  lindsey leno didn't deserve to be lied to and told the vaccine was safe and effective but
[26:32.040 --> 26:37.720]  i guess i'm jumping the shark assuming that a 36 year old woman bragging about her covid 19
[26:37.720 --> 26:42.600]  booster vaccine and then having the number one side effect from the covid 19 booster vaccine
[26:42.600 --> 26:46.920]  taking her life i guess they wouldn't like me to jump to that conclusion would they
[26:51.080 --> 26:51.480]  but no
[26:54.360 --> 27:03.000]  lindsey leno didn't deserve to be lied to about the safety or efficacy of a covid 19 vaccine
[27:03.000 --> 27:14.520]  i feel abandoned service member carolina stanek speaks out about her vaccine injury
[27:15.480 --> 27:20.280]  live interview with the gateway pundit that aired earlier today you can find it on the
[27:20.280 --> 27:27.880]  gateway pundit dot com so many stories i hear every day just like this whether it's just people
[27:27.880 --> 27:35.960]  talking to me or you're watching the news or talk radio it's just everywhere football player
[27:35.960 --> 27:41.720]  collapses suddenly after suffering from cardiac arrest during by stolston cup in norway
[27:44.120 --> 27:51.720]  i would suggest i would suggest these individuals join some of these lawsuits first lawsuit filed
[27:51.720 --> 27:56.280]  against fda for withholding dreadful vaccine safety data that's going to be a big one many many
[27:56.280 --> 28:02.200]  such lawsuits are going on now fiser's responding to the video coming out fiser claims it never
[28:02.200 --> 28:07.000]  conducted gain of function research in response to project veritas bombshell x was a well okay
[28:07.000 --> 28:12.120]  of course they're going to deny it but but here's what they do and we know fouchy was part of this
[28:12.120 --> 28:18.040]  his signatures on all the gain of function but why do i bring up this story woke school officials
[28:18.040 --> 28:22.760]  boast about secretly teaching crt without parental consent and there's undercover videos of them
[28:22.760 --> 28:27.080]  laughing about this how they know what they're doing is wrong how they know they're still
[28:27.080 --> 28:31.000]  teaching critical race theory they just rename it why am i tying this in folks this is the left
[28:31.000 --> 28:36.440]  psychology this is the political americans left psychology just like you saw in the undercover
[28:36.440 --> 28:41.000]  video with the school board just like you saw in the undercover video with the fiser executive
[28:41.000 --> 28:47.800]  they will knowingly consciously deceive you and lie to you for their political agenda do you
[28:47.800 --> 28:53.560]  understand this now you have to understand this i know you have friends and family that might be
[28:53.560 --> 28:58.360]  on the american left but it's just true they will lie for their political agenda
[29:01.160 --> 29:07.000]  i talk a lot about the great successes info wars this had i don't think anybody can deny it and it
[29:07.000 --> 29:12.520]  is because of listeners and viewers supporting us when we talk about the crew at info wars people
[29:12.520 --> 29:18.760]  behind the scenes the researchers the writers they really have been the mvps in this fight
[29:19.400 --> 29:24.120]  and we look at harrison smith and oh and shroyer and the hard work they engage in every day
[29:24.120 --> 29:29.800]  five six seven days a week it's really just incredible so for myself the whole info wars

[35:31.880 --> 35:37.640]  like most of the other media is and so they're not allowed to show you the project veritas
[35:37.640 --> 35:45.160]  fizer exposed video series but we're not beholding the big pharma and so we can but we are beholding
[35:45.160 --> 35:49.960]  to you the audience and you keep us on air that means we're doing a good job and so we appreciate
[35:49.960 --> 35:57.640]  that all right now i've only spent a half hour on that fizer deal and i should probably continue
[35:57.640 --> 36:05.480]  to cover it but there's other big news that we need to get to but that one really has them scared
[36:05.480 --> 36:09.880]  and i know there's more videos i don't know if and when project veritas is even planning to release
[36:09.880 --> 36:19.080]  them but they do have more video so i'm going to be looking forward to finding out if there's any
[36:19.080 --> 36:28.680]  interest from any members of congress in getting to the bottom of whatever it is
[36:28.680 --> 36:36.920]  that was being discussed in that project veritas video was there any interest after it was published
[36:36.920 --> 36:41.480]  from members of congress to do a little investigating into phizer's potential gain of function research
[36:41.480 --> 36:49.880]  but again just to kind of put an end cap in it why do i bring up the undercover recording of the
[36:49.880 --> 36:57.240]  liberal school administrators bragging about how they get around the laws by renaming what is critical
[36:57.240 --> 37:02.600]  race theory because you have to understand the psychology of these people it's funny to them
[37:02.600 --> 37:10.280]  they know they're lying they know they're deceiving you oh i don't do gain of function research and
[37:10.280 --> 37:15.240]  then they just change the definition of gain and gain of function oh we don't teach critical race
[37:15.240 --> 37:24.680]  theory ha ha ha ha yes we do we just renamed it we just we just call it different things we just
[37:24.680 --> 37:30.520]  call it culture and diversity and it's critical race theory that they're they're not allowed to
[37:30.520 --> 37:34.280]  teach kids how to be racist they're not allowed to teach kids how to hate each other or judge one
[37:34.280 --> 37:40.760]  another off of their skin color which is what the left is all about and so they're showing on the
[37:40.760 --> 37:44.600]  screen this ever undercover video of school administrators all leftist liberal school
[37:44.600 --> 37:49.560]  administrators bragging about how they deceive the parents and still teach critical race theory
[37:50.600 --> 37:57.880]  just like phizer just like anthony fouchy just like these big pharmaceutical companies lie to you
[37:57.880 --> 38:04.040]  do oh the vaccine is safe and effective when we tested it two years ago
[38:09.080 --> 38:13.560]  oh we're not doing gain of function research we're calling it directed evolution
[38:14.680 --> 38:22.600]  hehehe and he giggles in front of his grinder date so you have to understand the psychology
[38:22.600 --> 38:28.600]  of these people and that's what's so frustrating and you don't want to admit it you're a good person
[38:28.600 --> 38:33.000]  you don't want to assume this about your fellow human you're a good person out there listening
[38:34.440 --> 38:40.440]  you you don't want to hurt people you don't want to deceive people and and you don't want to think
[38:40.440 --> 38:43.080]  that there's others that might you don't want to think that it might be your friends and family
[38:43.080 --> 38:48.360]  you don't want to think that it might be anthony fouchy or people on tv or doctors or teachers
[38:48.360 --> 38:57.000]  but i'm sad to say we are witnessing a mass psychosis event we are witnessing mass mental illness
[38:57.000 --> 39:05.560]  mass stockholm syndrome the easiest way to describe it is american modern day liberalism
[39:08.440 --> 39:15.880]  it's not american it shouldn't be modern and it's anything but liberal but but that in and of itself
[39:15.880 --> 39:23.320]  is more proof about how they deceive oh i'm liberal oh i'm a liberal no you're not you're a fascist
[39:25.080 --> 39:31.080]  you love big government you love big tech you love big pharma even them calling themselves
[39:31.080 --> 39:39.080]  liberal is deceitful even them calling themselves liberals is a lie they're not they're fascist
[39:39.080 --> 39:47.160]  they're authoritarians they're statists they're brainwashed so that's why it's so important for
[39:47.160 --> 39:52.920]  you to understand this psychology so that you can recognize it and even though it might go against
[39:52.920 --> 39:59.320]  your current instincts and intuition wanting to judge somebody else or not judge somebody else
[39:59.320 --> 40:05.880]  is a bad guy but a good guy but now having to rethink that whole thing it's not the planet i
[40:05.880 --> 40:12.680]  want to live on but that's the reality of the situation i'm not the one promoting the propaganda
[40:12.680 --> 40:17.000]  i'm not the one lying and deceiving and manipulating people like phyzer has done
[40:20.200 --> 40:25.400]  but what do you expect when these are the type of doctors that work with the government doctor who
[40:25.400 --> 40:32.200]  claimed obesity can't be treated with diet and exercise tapped for role in usda's dietary guideline
[40:32.200 --> 40:41.080]  advisory committee i mean that's just absurd yeah if you are morbidly obese it is going to
[40:41.080 --> 40:46.200]  take a hell of a lot of work to get that weight off and get yourself healthy again yep that at
[40:46.200 --> 40:50.120]  times may seem impossible but it's not it is possible it's been proven it's possible and
[40:50.120 --> 40:54.600]  it is the most healthy way to do it and so what does the government do they hire you someone
[40:54.600 --> 41:00.840]  that says no just go have a surgery now just go under the knife go under the needle but actually
[41:00.840 --> 41:03.800]  there's nothing wrong with you being obese obesity is healthy now
[41:06.520 --> 41:11.400]  and why would that be does this they want you dead is that a big joke
[41:13.720 --> 41:19.160]  oh obesity is beautiful oh there's just nothing you can do about it oh you're just born this way
[41:20.840 --> 41:28.280]  why why do you lie to people like that what no it's it's it's horribly unhealthy it's definitely
[41:28.280 --> 41:33.640]  your diet that's causing it and your lack of exercise isn't helping and you should probably
[41:33.640 --> 41:43.720]  change something soon before you die or develop a severely life altering health issue but don't worry
[41:44.920 --> 41:51.000]  because the usda has hired dr fatima stanford who says there is no problem with you being obese at
[41:51.000 --> 42:00.440]  all and there's nothing you can do about it sick just sick so what do you expect what do you expect
[42:00.440 --> 42:06.280]  from our inept corrupt disgusting government who by the way i'm not going to spend much time on
[42:06.280 --> 42:13.640]  this is obviously protecting ray apps caught on video ray apps led break in of first step of first
[42:13.640 --> 42:19.320]  set of us capital barriers now we have video he was also in lead pack during break end of second set
[42:19.320 --> 42:28.280]  of barriers on january 6 project veritas or excuse me um the gateway pundit has the video so again
[42:28.280 --> 42:35.480]  there's ray apps right there at the front telling people to go in and nobody is arresting him amazing
[42:35.480 --> 42:42.840]  stuff oh yeah never when the uh american media and the democrats tried to drum up a bunch of riots
[42:42.840 --> 42:48.280]  this weekend we haven't even mentioned that yeah you only burned like two dozen buildings to the
[42:48.280 --> 42:52.680]  ground so i guess that's a failure for the american life they were hoping entire cities would burn
[42:53.480 --> 42:55.720]  sorry guys i guess you failed
[43:00.680 --> 43:06.760]  i talk a lot about the great successes info wars has had i don't think anybody can deny it and it is
[43:07.400 --> 43:12.120]  because of listeners and viewers supporting us when we talk about the crew at info wars people
[43:12.120 --> 43:18.280]  behind the scenes the researchers the writers they really have been the mvps in this fight
[43:19.000 --> 43:23.640]  and we look at harris and smith and oh and shroyer and the hard work they engage in every day
[43:23.640 --> 43:29.320]  five six seven days a week it's really just incredible so for myself the whole info wars
[43:29.320 --> 43:34.680]  crew i thank you for your past support i only encourage you now to realize that info wars

[44:15.160 --> 44:21.000]  they're all using the terms that info wars has popularized because we understand the enemy's
[44:21.000 --> 44:25.800]  operations and we know how to beat them but we can't do it without funding and we make it easy to

[46:24.200 --> 46:29.240]  myself i've been given so many opportunities because of this man and because of this platform
[46:29.240 --> 46:33.880]  and i would probably not even be half of where i am right now if it weren't for alex jones i mean

[47:26.280 --> 47:35.480]  all right i don't want to spend too much time on this but i do want to mention it here
[47:36.920 --> 47:44.840]  you had i mean the whole thing stinks obviously the american leftist liberal mainstream media
[47:45.480 --> 47:49.400]  has never seen an opportunity to start a riot that they didn't want to take
[47:49.400 --> 47:56.520]  and so the situation with an individual in memphis being pretty much brutally beaten
[47:57.160 --> 48:03.400]  by the police and then dying three days later they don't like you asking you know that though
[48:03.400 --> 48:06.280]  they don't let you talk about that they just say oh no they beat him to death right there
[48:06.280 --> 48:12.680]  well he died three days later in the hospital nonetheless it's a brutal video no doubt begs a
[48:12.680 --> 48:18.920]  lot of questions that you're not going to have asked or answered but situation is pretty dire
[48:18.920 --> 48:23.960]  when you watch that video of five police officers holding a guy back and just taking their shots at
[48:23.960 --> 48:28.760]  them until uh he is completely incapacitated and ultimately hospitalized and then dies
[48:31.560 --> 48:37.560]  now two incredible things about this phenomenon and then the larger takeaway
[48:39.880 --> 48:45.800]  when the media and the liberal left heard another big police brutality video leading to a death
[48:45.800 --> 48:52.200]  was about to come out they all jumped the shark and again started crying racism anti-black systemic
[48:52.200 --> 49:01.400]  racism white supremacy all the usual buzzwords and phrases and and stuff that they like to
[49:01.400 --> 49:07.640]  associate with police brutality well they got out a little ahead of themselves because the
[49:07.640 --> 49:16.600]  details hadn't emerged and it turned out that it was five black police officers that beat up the black
[49:16.600 --> 49:24.280]  individual that died and of course the chief of police there in Memphis is also black and so it's
[49:24.280 --> 49:29.560]  an amazing situation really when you have a situation and i don't know the exact demographics of
[49:29.560 --> 49:37.400]  Memphis but my guess is Memphis is probably demographically um one of the more black American
[49:37.400 --> 49:45.400]  areas in our country and i would also because most jurisdictions most police forces usually
[49:45.400 --> 49:50.840]  reflected pretty well if you look if you actually look at per capita numbers and demographics most
[49:50.840 --> 49:56.360]  most police stations are actually pretty representative pretty diverse even but my guess is
[49:56.360 --> 50:02.840]  the Memphis police department probably depicts that the same demographics of Memphis and so i
[50:02.840 --> 50:08.280]  don't think it's a surprise that you have five black cops or a black police chief if most of the
[50:08.280 --> 50:14.200]  population in Memphis is black okay but so they jumped the shark they called it racism and white
[50:14.200 --> 50:20.840]  supremacy well everybody involved was black and so now they were spinning out of control like a top
[50:20.840 --> 50:28.280]  trying to make this about white racism and making all these leaps and bounds saying well it's because
[50:28.840 --> 50:35.560]  policing itself is racist and and the idea of security is white supremacy and you know all
[50:35.560 --> 50:40.280]  this crazy stuff and you know the law having laws as white supremacists literally these are all the
[50:40.280 --> 50:46.120]  different arguments they were making trying to cope with the fact that this isn't an instance of
[50:46.840 --> 50:50.360]  white racism against a black person they just can't get over that fact it's just
[50:50.360 --> 50:59.880]  they're obsessed with it every day so they decided they were going to release the video
[50:59.880 --> 51:07.800]  after building it up for multiple days at prime time on a Friday night now you tell me what good
[51:07.800 --> 51:17.000]  that does you tell me who benefits from that crazy to think that the police
[51:17.000 --> 51:26.280]  were involved in that decision and still made it that is absurd that is obscene
[51:28.280 --> 51:33.080]  at the least you did it for television views which again why are the police interested in that
[51:33.080 --> 51:42.040]  at the most you did it hoping you would get riots right ahead of the weekend right on a Friday night
[51:42.040 --> 51:48.840]  right did you really do that what was the thought process involved in that why did you think that
[51:48.840 --> 51:55.720]  was a good idea because from anyone else they would say that seems like a bad idea to release it
[51:55.720 --> 52:04.200]  at prime time on a weekend right before you know would be the highest odds of getting
[52:04.200 --> 52:13.880]  violence in the streets and and you did just that I'm sorry I would believe the thought process
[52:15.320 --> 52:21.560]  should be we should put the video out when we could have the least amount of riding in the streets
[52:21.560 --> 52:27.080]  you went with let's put it out when we can have the most amount of riding in the streets interesting
[52:27.080 --> 52:35.240]  interesting but having said that they didn't get the big riots they wanted to and I think
[52:35.240 --> 52:41.400]  there's a couple reasons for that these things usually don't pop off in the winter like they do
[52:41.400 --> 52:47.480]  in summer for whatever reason call it the weather call it a spiritual vibration they just they
[52:47.480 --> 52:53.080]  summers when they're usually the worst it wasn't black police or it wasn't white police officers
[52:53.080 --> 52:59.160]  that killed a black guy so right then most people lost interest isn't that sadly ironic
[53:02.680 --> 53:09.480]  even though this instance of police brutality is far worse than what happened to George Floyd
[53:09.480 --> 53:17.400]  like not even in the same league like George Floyd is like that was handled with kid gloves
[53:17.400 --> 53:26.040]  that was handled like a George Floyd was handled like a Faber J egg compared to nickels
[53:32.520 --> 53:39.640]  so there you go so how do you explain that how do you explain all the riding and everything
[53:40.360 --> 53:46.040]  over George Floyd a situation that was handled like a Faber J egg and then the lack of riding
[53:46.040 --> 53:54.200]  over nickels a situation where it was like a bull in a china shop clear intent to do harm
[53:55.800 --> 54:05.000]  now people are asking some questions like how could this happen why would this happen is there
[54:05.000 --> 54:12.920]  something else behind this which yeah maybe it's fair to ask I would say so how why what motivated
[54:12.920 --> 54:17.000]  the cops to do something like this was there a prior relationship was there something else going on
[54:19.960 --> 54:22.680]  maybe it was the fact that they got charged with murder
[54:24.040 --> 54:27.640]  right out of the gates that helped quell some of the potential violence
[54:27.640 --> 54:32.360]  that we could have seen over the weekend but overall all I saw was a couple dozen police
[54:32.360 --> 54:38.120]  vehicles get smashed up a couple buildings burn a target of walmart burned to the ground at least
[54:38.120 --> 54:45.160]  so a couple dozen buildings couple dozen police cars you know that's that's light work for a leftist
[54:45.160 --> 54:50.280]  violent mob so all things considered you know they tried to they tried to drum it up they didn't
[54:50.280 --> 54:55.720]  get it they had all they didn't have all the characteristics they needed but again you try
[54:55.720 --> 55:01.480]  to think of it and you try to look at things for some universal consistency and again there's no
[55:01.480 --> 55:08.840]  denying that the george floyd situation was a one if it's a scale of one to ten of police brutality
[55:08.840 --> 55:14.840]  the george floyd situation was a one compared to this which is I mean nine maybe even ten
[55:16.360 --> 55:24.920]  and yet look at the difference in the response why why why the drastic inconsistency there
[55:24.920 --> 55:33.640]  okay but continuing in that vein we now have two separate occasions four overall two separate
[55:33.640 --> 55:38.200]  occasions of ray epps being right at the front of the january 6 mob when they're breaking through
[55:38.200 --> 55:43.560]  barriers and such no charges for him not to mention the videos from the prior night him
[55:43.560 --> 55:49.720]  saying we need to go into the capital no charges for him then there's the pulpulosi situation which
[55:49.720 --> 55:56.760]  continues to get weirder and weirder now it does appear at this point with the evidence we have
[55:57.560 --> 56:02.520]  that de pape did in well we know he broke in we have the video of him breaking in
[56:03.640 --> 56:11.320]  and he was essentially what it looks like trying to hold paul pulosi hostage waiting for nancy
[56:11.320 --> 56:19.800]  pelosi to get home uh that's with the evidence that we have that's what the situation appears to be
[56:19.800 --> 56:25.160]  now we're not like the fake news and the american left that wants to jump to a bunch of conclusions
[56:25.160 --> 56:29.560]  we wait to see the evidence and and and then try to reach a conclusion from from what we can
[56:30.360 --> 56:37.880]  see with what we have now the there's still odd things about this video pelosi seemingly relaxed
[56:37.880 --> 56:46.680]  with the drink the weirdness on the phone call pelosi in his underwear but de pape is basically
[56:47.400 --> 56:53.240]  i mean his comments even censor weird assaulter says sorry i didn't get more of them after
[56:53.240 --> 56:59.400]  attack tape released now i don't want to get too conspiratorial because i mean again what
[56:59.400 --> 57:05.080]  what it appears to be and what we know is that yeah and i don't think there was a third person
[57:05.080 --> 57:11.160]  or whatever's going on with this i don't i'm not buying into that any of that uh the one the one
[57:11.160 --> 57:16.200]  thing if i wanted to get conspiratorial or ask a question leading down a potential conspiracy
[57:16.200 --> 57:22.680]  theory like that i would just say could this potentially be some form of a justy small
[57:22.680 --> 57:28.280]  that situation now that's i'm not going to go down that road because again the conclusion
[57:28.280 --> 57:33.000]  i've reached based on the evidence is no de pape broke in and was basically holding him hostage
[57:33.000 --> 57:41.560]  uh until nancy got home and who knows what would happen if the police didn't send cops over there
[57:42.360 --> 57:46.280]  but no there's still weirdness there's still weirdness to that video and there's still weirdness
[57:46.280 --> 57:53.240]  to the whole situation no doubt the good news is the real red pill plus after over two years
[57:53.240 --> 57:57.480]  being sold out because the key ingredients are not available but supply chain right now is
[57:57.480 --> 58:02.280]  is finally back in stock in the last month the bad news is we eliminated run of it and it's
[58:02.280 --> 58:08.280]  almost sold out so we're in late january when i'm cutting this only seven days left to get the real
[58:08.280 --> 58:14.200]  red pill plus with all the key ingredients like preglonon and more at infowarstore.com for 50%
[58:14.200 --> 58:19.800]  off whether you're older young black or white doesn't matter you need to experience real red pill

[59:51.240 --> 59:57.240]  leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order it's alex jones
[01:00:03.880 --> 01:00:09.000]  all right i was already planning on covering this story and there had been multiple developments
[01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:15.240]  just since i guess really friday when i couldn't get to it
[01:00:17.800 --> 01:00:23.720]  and uh there's been multiple developments now so let me just try to read some of these headlines
[01:00:23.720 --> 01:00:30.440]  chicken farmers blame tainted feed after hen stop producing eggs and i got a video of there's
[01:00:30.440 --> 01:00:35.640]  multiple videos out there but i've got one video i'll play here now let me just tell you i talked
[01:00:35.640 --> 01:00:42.040]  to farmers i talked to homesteaders i talked to people that have chickens and what the conclusion
[01:00:42.040 --> 01:00:50.280]  they've reached is the big chicken feed manufacturers changed some of their ingredients and it's
[01:00:50.280 --> 01:00:55.880]  caused the hens to stop laying eggs whereas the farmers that are still feeding organic or even
[01:00:55.880 --> 01:01:01.880]  just table scraps even the farmers just feeding table scraps they're not having problems their hens
[01:01:01.880 --> 01:01:07.880]  are still laying eggs no problem but now an even bigger story really potentially it's
[01:01:07.880 --> 01:01:13.640]  all tied in though firefighting continues firefighters continue to assess damage after
[01:01:13.640 --> 01:01:21.800]  large fire at basra egg farm 100 000 chickens die in basra egg farm fire massive fire destroys
[01:01:21.800 --> 01:01:30.520]  commercial egg farm of top us supplier amid widespread egg shortage so uh you're seeing
[01:01:30.520 --> 01:01:36.200]  that footage on the screen my goodness just add this to the list of food processing plants and
[01:01:36.200 --> 01:01:41.400]  other such similar structures and infrastructure that have been attacked in the last two years
[01:01:41.400 --> 01:01:46.200]  ever since biden got into office that started happening oddly enough of course bill gates has
[01:01:46.200 --> 01:01:53.480]  invested over 10 years ago he invested in what he called eggless chickens or a chickenless eggs
[01:01:53.480 --> 01:01:58.680]  rather actually i'm sorry i've reversed that chickenless eggs um okay so that story continues
[01:01:58.680 --> 01:02:05.320]  but here is one individual talking about the egg shortage in clip 14 really conspiracy it's being
[01:02:05.320 --> 01:02:12.120]  confirmed not only here in our house but apparently all over the nation and nobody said anything about
[01:02:12.120 --> 01:02:17.880]  it because we all just seem to his winner they stopped laying in the winter as much and come to
[01:02:17.880 --> 01:02:24.040]  find out that everybody across the nation stopped getting eggs from their chickens all together
[01:02:24.040 --> 01:02:29.480]  nobody got a single egg all winter from there everybody's reporting end of september to
[01:02:30.760 --> 01:02:36.520]  like mid october the chicken stopped laying in our stop laying in september we hadn't had a single
[01:02:36.520 --> 01:02:43.480]  egg all winter well we discovered we have a little escape artist here luna our white leg
[01:02:43.480 --> 01:02:52.040]  horn there she can get out of the coop and just we can't contain her anyway she started laying
[01:02:52.040 --> 01:02:59.400]  again about a month ago and we discovered that that's weird she started to lay and nobody's
[01:02:59.400 --> 01:03:07.320]  laid in months like we have gone months we've gone months without any eggs at all so we started
[01:03:07.320 --> 01:03:10.520]  looking into it and then finally somebody said something in one of the chicken groups and they
[01:03:10.520 --> 01:03:16.600]  were like hey is anybody else's chickens not laid a single egg because we've had them for 50 years
[01:03:16.600 --> 01:03:22.920]  and we've never gone a winter without a single egg not one not one single egg well we started
[01:03:22.920 --> 01:03:27.480]  letting our chickens out and to free range we usually feed them you can see they're not even
[01:03:27.480 --> 01:03:32.280]  touching the feed anymore like this has been here for three days they don't want it and apparently
[01:03:33.080 --> 01:03:38.760]  everybody who's been feeding their chickens this type of feed has stopped getting eggs all together
[01:03:38.760 --> 01:03:42.600]  so people who aren't able to let their chickens free range or can't run around the yard at all
[01:03:42.600 --> 01:03:48.680]  aren't getting any eggs kind of convenient when eggs are the price of
[01:03:50.760 --> 01:03:56.920]  i don't even know gold at this point i guess but yeah so let's check over here and see if we
[01:03:56.920 --> 01:04:01.800]  have any today where they've been out wait to keep them up yesterday okay so all kinds of similar
[01:04:01.800 --> 01:04:08.520]  videos and we've posted some of those at info wars.com with the uh with the headline
[01:04:08.520 --> 01:04:20.200]  that i have in front of me here chicken farmers blame tainted feed after hen stopped producing
[01:04:20.200 --> 01:04:24.440]  eggs and like i said i just talked to some local farmers here i got friends at homestead that have
[01:04:24.440 --> 01:04:29.160]  chickens you know farmers market everything and they basically said the same thing the people
[01:04:29.160 --> 01:04:36.120]  that are having problems still getting eggs are the ones giving them just the most basic feed you
[01:04:36.120 --> 01:04:40.520]  know the mainline feed instead of either organic stuff that's harder to find or even table scraps
[01:04:40.520 --> 01:04:45.320]  is working or just letting them free range and so you know it'd be amazing imagine all of this stuff
[01:04:45.320 --> 01:04:50.040]  going on around you and not even having the basic instincts to look around and say huh
[01:04:50.600 --> 01:04:57.720]  something's going on here something going on things around here just don't add up
[01:04:57.720 --> 01:05:09.640]  cover commander here with an important message to humanity i have decided that all of you will
[01:05:09.640 --> 01:05:20.040]  take a special injection so that you will be safe but the injection is not ready and so i need all
[01:05:20.040 --> 01:05:29.640]  of you to stay indoors for the next 15 days to flatten the can i also need you to wear masks
[01:05:29.640 --> 01:05:38.440]  and i also need you to only shop at mega corporations that way we can consolidate control
[01:05:38.440 --> 01:05:47.000]  and bankrupt the world economy leaving companies that only i own profitable you will then be my
[01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:55.400]  slaves oh and then you get that special shot of freedom from cobra will move your immune system
[01:05:55.400 --> 01:06:02.440]  so you'll be dependent on me for the rest of your miserable lives and in competence joe
[01:06:02.440 --> 01:06:07.320]  biden has brought us to the brink of world war three we're at the brink of world war three just
[01:06:07.320 --> 01:06:13.560]  in case anybody doesn't know it as president i will bring back peace through strength peace
[01:06:13.560 --> 01:06:19.080]  through strength would have never happened if i was president there would not have been a war
[01:06:19.080 --> 01:06:24.520]  with russia in ukraine zero chance and lindsay would be happy with that that's better than any
[01:06:24.520 --> 01:06:30.600]  alternative wouldn't have happened and i will say this even now despite tremendous loss of lives
[01:06:30.600 --> 01:06:36.920]  and destruction of much of that country i would have a peace deal negotiated within 24 hours you
[01:06:36.920 --> 01:06:43.640]  could make a peace deal you could make a deal for both right now 24 so that was trump over the weekend
[01:06:43.640 --> 01:06:47.000]  by the way is that him kind of rubbing lindsay gramm's nose in it a little bit there do you
[01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:53.240]  guys get that that felt like a front rubbing lindsay gramm's nose in it a little bit like yeah
[01:06:53.240 --> 01:06:59.240]  lindsay i i know who you really are everybody does it's kind of a joke around here but no that
[01:06:59.240 --> 01:07:04.040]  was donald trump over the weekend in south carolina he was also rallying in new hampshire
[01:07:04.040 --> 01:07:09.560]  and the real story here is not donald trump but how biden is getting us closer to world war three
[01:07:09.560 --> 01:07:15.560]  by his own words by his own words he's even started world war three when a year ago he said
[01:07:15.560 --> 01:07:21.160]  look if we start sending tanks and airplanes over to ukraine that's world war three well now here
[01:07:21.160 --> 01:07:29.480]  we are and he's doing just that but but quickly on the trump front i guess the story here is that
[01:07:29.480 --> 01:07:40.440]  that i'm asking myself why is trump seemingly generating no momentum politically right now
[01:07:40.440 --> 01:07:44.680]  what is behind that because i had no idea he was speaking this weekend none
[01:07:46.920 --> 01:07:52.600]  and i do think republicans need to do a better job as far as outreach is concerned letting people
[01:07:52.600 --> 01:07:57.160]  know what's going on because anytime there's a leftist liberal democrat event in town you get
[01:07:57.160 --> 01:08:01.880]  50 different text messages emails everything the tv telling you about it when there's a
[01:08:01.880 --> 01:08:06.360]  conservative event in town you barely even hear about it like yesterday there was a
[01:08:06.360 --> 01:08:13.720]  texas march for life i didn't get a single email i was pleasantly surprised two weeks ago when i
[01:08:13.720 --> 01:08:20.040]  got an email the day before the texans or i guess that was last week excuse me yeah the day before
[01:08:20.040 --> 01:08:25.720]  the texan sort of vaccine choice rally i attended this week i was lucky enough to get an email before
[01:08:25.720 --> 01:08:31.240]  from the from a republican representative oh thank you for letting me know i showed up so did others
[01:08:32.360 --> 01:08:39.960]  but then nothing not a single email text nothing on the news about the texas right for life rally
[01:08:39.960 --> 01:08:45.880]  that happened yesterday so they do need to fill in the blanks as far as getting people informed
[01:08:45.880 --> 01:08:50.200]  to show up at these events when they do that conservatives show up that is the message we
[01:08:50.200 --> 01:08:57.800]  show up now when we got the email and the notification about texans for vaccine choice people showed up
[01:08:58.680 --> 01:09:04.520]  conservatives will show up if you let them know what's going on that's the problem so
[01:09:06.520 --> 01:09:11.960]  so even though trump had two big rallies and that generated some good clips barely any momentum
[01:09:11.960 --> 01:09:19.320]  from these rallies over the weekend and i guess is it really is it really the power of fox news
[01:09:19.320 --> 01:09:25.160]  where if if a tree falls in the forest and it doesn't fall it doesn't make a noise if fox news
[01:09:25.160 --> 01:09:32.040]  doesn't cover a trump speech or a trump rally then nobody knows about it and folks i'm speaking to
[01:09:32.040 --> 01:09:37.800]  you from a guy that spends hours every day consuming aggregating news and it barely was a blip on the
[01:09:37.800 --> 01:09:45.560]  radar but he was calling for peace says he's ready to turn new hampshire red when he's in new hampshire
[01:09:45.560 --> 01:09:53.320]  says we need blessings from god it's good stuff it is good stuff and and you know trump is looking
[01:09:53.320 --> 01:09:58.680]  healthy so but it's not generating anything it's not generating a buzz it's not generating any
[01:09:58.680 --> 01:10:05.800]  momentum nationwide it's seemingly falling on deaf ears deaf ears but okay it is happening
[01:10:05.800 --> 01:10:11.400]  and he's right about the biden situation now let's just look at these headlines
[01:10:11.400 --> 01:10:14.920]  with the situation in ukraine
[01:10:17.480 --> 01:10:23.960]  group of pentagon officials secretly lobbying sending f-16 jets to ukraine reports say
[01:10:25.480 --> 01:10:33.880]  now this was reported in sputnik and then also it was on fox news this morning and so uh i would
[01:10:33.880 --> 01:10:39.720]  bet you by the end of the week that they either have a deal on the table or they already have
[01:10:39.720 --> 01:10:47.560]  jets on the ground either in poland or germany i don't think they'll be able to get them right into
[01:10:47.560 --> 01:10:51.560]  ukraine they're gonna have a problem here folks seriously there will be a problem when they move
[01:10:51.560 --> 01:10:56.920]  those tanks into ukraine or they move whatever other heavy artillery or jets or whatever into
[01:10:56.920 --> 01:11:01.160]  ukraine the russians are going to blow it up immediately and maybe that's what they want maybe
[01:11:01.160 --> 01:11:05.800]  that's what biden wants i mean even germany has been like we don't want to do this you're just
[01:11:05.800 --> 01:11:10.280]  asking us to have to send these weapons into ukraine they're just going to get blown up immediately
[01:11:11.240 --> 01:11:15.080]  and biden finally convinced him to do it said fine we'll send tanks too we'll send
[01:11:15.080 --> 01:11:21.080]  tanks too we'll protect them we'll make sure they're good so germany was like okay all right
[01:11:21.080 --> 01:11:28.200]  and poland's there like wanting it too so my guess is by the end of the week we hear we hear
[01:11:28.200 --> 01:11:33.960]  something a little more solid as far as this is concerned joe biden admitted sending tanks to
[01:11:33.960 --> 01:11:39.240]  ukraine would be world war three months before he did it yep remember that from last week that's
[01:11:39.240 --> 01:11:46.440]  still a big deal Croatian president calls germany's we are at war with russia comment madness no it's
[01:11:46.440 --> 01:11:55.000]  it's an it's an unofficial illegal war that the west has launched against russia in ukraine
[01:11:55.880 --> 01:11:59.000]  yeah it's madness all right but but biden's the one that did it
[01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:07.800]  it and Zelensky is the one that did it so they're the mad ones russia seeks gains in
[01:12:07.800 --> 01:12:13.400]  ukraine before western tanks turn up they've already had their gains once again the western
[01:12:13.400 --> 01:12:19.160]  media behind the ball race against time to get tanks to ukraine before europe engulfed in russia
[01:12:19.160 --> 01:12:28.040]  war it's it's just a complete because here's the thing first of all the the people running the
[01:12:28.040 --> 01:12:32.760]  us military right now not all but but most people have put it in a position of leadership because
[01:12:32.760 --> 01:12:37.800]  they're far left and because they're completely clueless and so they really have no military
[01:12:38.760 --> 01:12:44.600]  strategic advantage at all over anybody so our military is inept as far as the leadership is
[01:12:44.600 --> 01:12:51.160]  concerned they also know really they know that starting this this war with russia could end in
[01:12:51.160 --> 01:12:55.640]  world war three and they know that essentially everything they've done to this point in this
[01:12:55.640 --> 01:13:00.440]  proxy war against russia has been done without congressional approval and certainly would not
[01:13:00.440 --> 01:13:05.800]  be approved by the american people so they've been trying to slow walk it and not really truly reveal
[01:13:05.800 --> 01:13:14.360]  what's going on but because of that now they're in a situation where the only thing they can do
[01:13:14.360 --> 01:13:19.880]  to stop russia is basically start a nuclear war russia has all the strategic leverage all the advantage
[01:13:19.880 --> 01:13:28.120]  and all the the corrupt leaders in the west that underestimated russia the whole time and lied to
[01:13:28.120 --> 01:13:33.560]  you the whole time all they have left to stop russia as a full on out war with russia which would
[01:13:33.560 --> 01:13:39.720]  lead to world war three and now they're so inept as well that this isn't a situation where the
[01:13:39.720 --> 01:13:44.360]  u.s. comes out and makes a big powerful speech with joe biden or somebody but it is joe biden
[01:13:44.360 --> 01:13:51.000]  that's the president and the world is taken the world is just completely taken by the
[01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:55.960]  speech and just so moved and so motivated that oh it's the right thing to get rid of putin or it's
[01:13:55.960 --> 01:14:01.480]  the right thing to do whatever that ain't gonna happen jack if biden goes up there and tries to
[01:14:01.480 --> 01:14:07.880]  deliver some rousing speech like that he'll fumble bumble slobber his whole way through it and the
[01:14:07.880 --> 01:14:18.840]  world will not laugh anymore but we'll look at the u.s. as a weakened state if not a completely
[01:14:18.840 --> 01:14:27.720]  defunct nation and so putin will rise and then jijin ping will rise and then the rest of the
[01:14:27.720 --> 01:14:36.040]  dominos will fall and biden will be standing there and the u.s. will be on the ground nowhere near
[01:14:36.040 --> 01:14:40.680]  the international superpower it once was respected as
[01:14:43.240 --> 01:14:50.680]  hungry's or bond ukraine's backers have drifted into war exactly just just kind of drifted you
[01:14:50.680 --> 01:15:03.160]  into it these incompetent corrupt bastards like joe biden here is the official russia account on
[01:15:03.160 --> 01:15:09.560]  twitter at the u.s. romstein airbase in germany nato confirmed they would boost supplies of
[01:15:09.560 --> 01:15:15.000]  modern heavy offensive weapons to Kiev this is yet another indication that the west plans to raise
[01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:19.400]  the stakes in the conflict prolonging it and raising the number of casualties and nobody's
[01:15:19.400 --> 01:15:24.040]  coming forward for peace except donald trump that they made sure couldn't get back into the white
[01:15:24.040 --> 01:15:30.040]  house loyal to the motherland joining russia's youth army oh this will scare this will scare people
[01:15:30.040 --> 01:15:37.480]  but see the difference is they do propaganda to russian's youth that makes them want to be strong

[01:19:57.960 --> 01:20:07.080]  leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order it's alex jones
[01:20:16.120 --> 01:20:20.280]  to the town of our free road a stranger one fine day
[01:20:21.480 --> 01:20:25.800]  all right i'm going to be able to get through the news right now and then we're going to open up
[01:20:25.800 --> 01:20:37.720]  the phone lines quickly before i do that though Novak Djokovic this morning won the 10th his 10th
[01:20:37.720 --> 01:20:46.280]  australian open a year after being banned from australia for refusing the covid-19 vaccine
[01:20:47.080 --> 01:20:53.880]  and this is truly an incredible story and throughout history there have been
[01:20:53.880 --> 01:20:57.720]  instances of great athletes being denied
[01:21:00.120 --> 01:21:06.440]  their true level of greatness one of the more historic examples could be
[01:21:06.440 --> 01:21:12.120]  ted williams a baseball player going to serve in a war or you could talk about ruben hurricane
[01:21:12.120 --> 01:21:21.320]  carter the boxing champion who was a victim of racism and spent time in jail instead of fighting
[01:21:21.320 --> 01:21:29.160]  for boxing titles and so Novak Djokovic who i believe now is either tied for the all-time
[01:21:29.160 --> 01:21:34.760]  lead in grand slam championships in fact guys pull up the number on the screen for me but
[01:21:35.480 --> 01:21:40.280]  there should be an asterisk there because the discrimination that Djokovic faced not being
[01:21:40.280 --> 01:21:47.800]  able to compete in multiple grand slam title tournaments because he refused the covid-19
[01:21:47.800 --> 01:21:55.320]  vaccine so could he have won the australian open the times he was denied because of his vaccine
[01:21:55.320 --> 01:22:08.920]  status well we'll never know but truly a momentous occasion for Djokovic and i would say now he
[01:22:08.920 --> 01:22:13.080]  probably has to be the most celebrated and accomplished tennis player of all time he's
[01:22:13.080 --> 01:22:20.200]  obviously not done winning titles yet anyway but good for him a man that stood up for his values
[01:22:22.680 --> 01:22:31.720]  and never sold out could have cost him a shot at being the number one all-time grand slam
[01:22:31.720 --> 01:22:40.200]  grand slam champion and instead he stuck by his principles and he may still yet accomplish that
[01:22:40.200 --> 01:22:46.360]  feat anyway so uh there you go guys can we put that on the screen by the way though what uh
[01:22:46.360 --> 01:22:52.040]  what is the record i think he's tied now i think there's two or three people that have 22 grand slam
[01:22:52.040 --> 01:22:58.760]  titles and so i think Djokovic would have to win one more to separate himself from that field
[01:22:59.480 --> 01:23:05.160]  of course could have already been if not for being denied access to some of the
[01:23:05.160 --> 01:23:14.600]  tournaments because of the vaccine status um no guys you'd want to search like all-time grand slam
[01:23:15.480 --> 01:23:21.240]  champions he's got 22 i think Nadal or or or Federer maybe tied with him
[01:23:23.080 --> 01:23:27.800]  i think Federer recently retired Nadal's probably not far off if he hasn't already either
[01:23:27.800 --> 01:23:32.440]  but Djokovic's still prime enough to win another title so i think he still needs one more though
[01:23:32.440 --> 01:23:39.480]  i think Nadal has 22 i'm not sure um but now it's just taking too long to get on the screen so i'm
[01:23:39.480 --> 01:23:45.960]  trying to kill time uh okay yeah they are tied now Nadal and Djokovic are now tied at 22 apiece
[01:23:46.760 --> 01:23:51.560]  so he needs one more could he have already won one more if not for the anti-vax stance
[01:23:51.560 --> 01:23:58.280]  causing him to be discriminated against in these tournaments you know we'll never know but he might
[01:23:58.280 --> 01:24:05.320]  not be done as it is all right we're going to take phone calls the rest of the way 877-789-2539
[01:24:05.320 --> 01:24:12.280]  877-789-2539 a couple segments of your calls anything we've discussed today is fair game
[01:24:13.160 --> 01:24:17.320]  a couple other issues though before we do that you know this whole notion and it's not just the
[01:24:17.320 --> 01:24:23.800]  obamas but i i'll use this as a starter obamas call for police reform after release of tyree
[01:24:23.800 --> 01:24:28.840]  nickel's body camera footage and linked to black lives matter toolkits oh yeah because black lives
[01:24:28.840 --> 01:24:35.000]  matters and so much good for the country but no i'm going to get into more of this tomorrow this
[01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:41.240]  response of okay because here's what they did they jumped the shark and they said this is another
[01:24:41.240 --> 01:24:46.360]  example of white supremacy well not a white person was involved oops so now what are they arguing
[01:24:46.360 --> 01:24:50.360]  well they're saying police just in general even if even if every police officer on the planet was
[01:24:50.360 --> 01:24:57.320]  black it would still be white supremacy okay so now they're back to their starting point where they
[01:24:57.320 --> 01:25:05.240]  were at years ago and they want total abolishment of the police now i find this funny because as
[01:25:05.240 --> 01:25:11.640]  usual liberals don't actually want what they ask for and i would actually play this game with them
[01:25:11.640 --> 01:25:17.480]  at this point i would say you know what i agree let's completely abolish the police let's just
[01:25:17.480 --> 01:25:25.560]  abolish the police all together now who's gonna enforce all your laws you ever thought about
[01:25:25.560 --> 01:25:33.160]  that one who's gonna enforce your mask mandates huh who's gonna enforce your vaccine mandates
[01:25:33.960 --> 01:25:41.560]  who's gonna come take our guns so yeah they've gone full circle and and it's back to we need
[01:25:41.560 --> 01:25:45.640]  to totally abolish the police so okay so so here's what you're really asking for
[01:25:45.640 --> 01:25:54.440]  for what you're really asking for is essentially eliminating any form of
[01:25:57.240 --> 01:26:02.120]  government that can be enforced it's really what you're what you're asking for i mean let's
[01:26:02.120 --> 01:26:06.440]  just let's let's let's reach the logical conclusion here if you abolish the police what's gonna happen
[01:26:06.440 --> 01:26:11.800]  no laws are going to be enforced and so you've effectively pretty much ended government how
[01:26:11.800 --> 01:26:21.960]  are you gonna enforce anything oh well they say they want a citizens police force uh i got news for
[01:26:21.960 --> 01:26:30.440]  you that's already what it is the police are already american citizens uh did you not know that
[01:26:30.440 --> 01:26:36.760]  is that how uninformed you are wow okay oh they want to citizens oh so volunteers
[01:26:36.760 --> 01:26:44.440]  oh how long is that gonna last how long are people gonna be volunteering themselves until
[01:26:44.440 --> 01:26:50.120]  the first and the second get shot and killed trying to stop a crime how many volunteers
[01:26:50.120 --> 01:27:00.200]  are you gonna have how's that gonna go yeah so what you're really asking for is the inability
[01:27:00.200 --> 01:27:08.280]  to ever enforce any laws ever again so a lawless society or you want a militarization of the streets
[01:27:09.080 --> 01:27:13.800]  that's all it is and that's the problem with the american left is that they don't have
[01:27:13.800 --> 01:27:19.000]  multi layers of thinking all they can think is abolish police well what comes next well i haven't
[01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:26.840]  thought about that clearly just like every other policy you push for abolish the police then what
[01:27:26.840 --> 01:27:38.600]  there'll be no more racism you guys are funny you guys are funny
[01:27:41.080 --> 01:27:44.600]  so we're gonna get more into that tomorrow but it's just incredible they squeeze
[01:27:44.600 --> 01:27:48.120]  racism out of any situation they can even when there's no white people involved
[01:27:49.160 --> 01:27:52.600]  but i'm gonna have more on that tomorrow and i'm glad the crew is pulling up these clips
[01:27:52.600 --> 01:27:57.320]  and let's just go ahead and put those in tomorrow's show folder too guys because i'm gonna i'm gonna
[01:27:57.320 --> 01:28:05.640]  dig more into that issue tomorrow now a couple other headlines air force general predicts war
[01:28:05.640 --> 01:28:11.240]  with china by 2025 and that's really what it comes down to folks the the russia war with world war
[01:28:11.240 --> 01:28:16.600]  three is like the starter but it's gonna be china that's gonna end up russia's gonna we're driving
[01:28:16.600 --> 01:28:21.480]  russia right into chinese arms i mean that's what it comes down to with the us under current
[01:28:21.480 --> 01:28:27.800]  leadership is driving russia right into the communist arms and i can't believe this is happening
[01:28:27.800 --> 01:28:34.040]  this is such a damn shame and it just shows like i don't have to come on air and convince you that
[01:28:34.040 --> 01:28:40.120]  germany is no longer nazi right so why do we have to have this whole debate that russia isn't
[01:28:41.080 --> 01:28:46.760]  hardcore oppressive communists anymore like why are we doing this bullcrap now we're gonna
[01:28:46.760 --> 01:28:53.960]  drive russia back into the arms of communism putin wants to westernize but here's our corrupt
[01:28:53.960 --> 01:28:59.800]  leadership just driving him in the arms of the commies what a shame everybody that's watching

[01:34:09.400 --> 01:34:20.600]  oh
[01:34:26.760 --> 01:34:32.840]  it is so the epitome of everything the left represents just utter embarrassment utter
[01:34:32.840 --> 01:34:40.920]  shame utter failure utter destruction but it's diversity and so we accept it it's just total
[01:34:40.920 --> 01:34:51.960]  collapse just complete embarrassment let me just i gotta take some calls folks we got bone
[01:34:51.960 --> 01:34:58.600]  brought plus i'm sorry that's just a little too much the dude in leotards has left the children's
[01:34:58.600 --> 01:35:06.680]  library and is now skating around uh doing figure skating and it's anything but i mean look i uh
[01:35:08.120 --> 01:35:13.880]  i'm not the best ice skater out there but even i could have put on a better performance than
[01:35:13.880 --> 01:35:19.240]  that i mean you couldn't find a dude that can ice skate i guess that's because all the dudes that
[01:35:19.240 --> 01:35:25.720]  can ice skate would rather just would rather just be themselves and and be gay or whatever
[01:35:25.720 --> 01:35:32.200]  then compete against women i guess that's what this comes down to i mean for real like how do
[01:35:32.200 --> 01:35:38.760]  you even how do you even explain this how do you even explain putting a dude dressed as a girl on
[01:35:38.760 --> 01:35:47.400]  the ice as a figure skater that can't even skate can't even skate i guess that's the level of
[01:35:47.400 --> 01:35:55.560]  competition oh so beautiful so brave so stunning and brave so courageous oh here you can't get up

[01:37:21.880 --> 01:37:30.200]  equation like jose called in from new york jose you're on the air go ahead hey oh and uh thanks
[01:37:30.200 --> 01:37:36.680]  for having me um it's a pleasure to be on the show um wanted to talk about a little bit of the
[01:37:36.680 --> 01:37:40.920]  psychology of the left that you were mentioning in the beginning of the show because i think it's
[01:37:40.920 --> 01:37:48.120]  very important for people to understand that we're at this stage now where like you said like you
[01:37:48.120 --> 01:37:53.320]  kind of have to like kind of prejudgement even though you as a person may not do that but
[01:37:54.040 --> 01:37:59.640]  you kind of have to prejudgement when it comes to the left and when it especially when it comes
[01:37:59.640 --> 01:38:07.240]  to the politics yeah it's like if i'm out in the woods and i see a nice big cuddly bear boy i would
[01:38:07.240 --> 01:38:11.960]  love that bear to be nice and cuddly and i'd love to just go up and give him a noogie you know and
[01:38:11.960 --> 01:38:16.920]  we'd have a good time snuggling one another it'd be great wouldn't it but no i'm a little smarter
[01:38:16.920 --> 01:38:23.000]  i know a bear could rip me to shreds if it wanted and oh let's say i know that that's a mother bear
[01:38:23.000 --> 01:38:27.800]  and the cubs are right there behind her oh well now i know i'm in big trouble i better get the
[01:38:27.800 --> 01:38:34.840]  hell out of dodge and so it's really just a survival instinct yeah that's a perfectly great
[01:38:34.840 --> 01:38:41.320]  example there's also a great book um by michael knows called speechless controlling words controlling
[01:38:41.320 --> 01:38:47.160]  minds in which the left always they don't have the left doesn't have to change the amendments they
[01:38:47.160 --> 01:38:54.200]  don't have to change laws they can simply influence the culture and just change the definition of a
[01:38:54.200 --> 01:39:01.160]  word no that's not a that's not a pedophile that's a minor attracted person yeah that's right that's
[01:39:01.160 --> 01:39:07.560]  how it stands that's how i i uh what are they doing with the age now it's uh i'm trans age now
[01:39:07.560 --> 01:39:15.640]  they're trans age when the hell is it gonna stop you could just be trans racial you could just be
[01:39:15.640 --> 01:39:20.520]  trans black you know it's funny though that's the one thing and that's the one thing they don't want
[01:39:20.520 --> 01:39:28.120]  to give up though isn't that amazing and we all know why yeah the one thing they'll never accept
[01:39:28.120 --> 01:39:34.120]  is trans race and we all know why because they like having the race race class groups because
[01:39:34.120 --> 01:39:41.720]  they use it to pit people against one another i think rachel doll is always ahead of his time
[01:39:41.720 --> 01:39:47.400]  eventually they'll use it against the right maybe and don't forget about the guy's name
[01:39:47.400 --> 01:39:58.440]  shan king i think was his name yeah uh yes um yeah shan king yeah and of course it's it's all
[01:39:58.440 --> 01:40:03.400]  insanity but it's what the left promotes but again it's funny they don't the one thing they'll never
[01:40:03.400 --> 01:40:09.560]  accept is trans race because they love manipulating racial groups and classifying racial groups and
[01:40:09.560 --> 01:40:15.000]  so if they make that just a spectrum well then most of their intellect goes away and most of their
[01:40:15.000 --> 01:40:21.880]  arguments become irrelevant hosay thanks for the call let's go to genie in kansas genie you're on the
[01:40:21.880 --> 01:40:30.280]  air go ahead yes oh and um this is the first time i've ever done anything like this so
[01:40:30.280 --> 01:40:42.840]  i'm pretty nervous about it um i wanted to state that um uh the country is going to go down the
[01:40:42.840 --> 01:40:49.880]  tubes because of what they're doing and this is what my take is they're letting these people
[01:40:49.880 --> 01:41:01.160]  across our border okay you know that most of them are like in their middle 20s or younger okay my uh
[01:41:01.160 --> 01:41:07.880]  experience with that was we've coming up through texas and there was we stopped and stayed at a
[01:41:07.880 --> 01:41:17.400]  hotel that just had been opened and the motel was full of these young men they all had new clothes
[01:41:18.280 --> 01:41:25.080]  and the lady that was living there told me that they come a bus comes get some every day
[01:41:25.880 --> 01:41:32.920]  early in the afternoon and brings them back at five okay what's going on with that and next
[01:41:32.920 --> 01:41:42.120]  you go on down they eliminate our oil reserve okay now they're shipping all our our weapons and
[01:41:42.120 --> 01:41:49.800]  everything away okay and then our young men are dying from all these shots you take a piece of
[01:41:49.800 --> 01:41:56.760]  paper and write that all down and see what you come up with they're going to let the chinese
[01:41:56.760 --> 01:42:04.520]  just walk in here and take us over we have no weapons we have no oil reserve we have no young
[01:42:04.520 --> 01:42:12.360]  men that would go into our military because they're all dead from the shots and our government has
[01:42:13.240 --> 01:42:23.720]  the replacement army well what you described is the situation we have our leader our president
[01:42:23.720 --> 01:42:29.880]  is a foreign agent and so everything you've just described is what would happen if your leader your
[01:42:29.880 --> 01:42:35.800]  president was a foreign agent and so that's exactly what we have now i've never been one talking about
[01:42:35.800 --> 01:42:41.000]  a land invasion because i just don't see it making any sense there's no purpose for anybody to do a
[01:42:41.000 --> 01:42:48.920]  land invasion of the united states if they can just basically suck dry our exports or if they can
[01:42:48.920 --> 01:42:54.760]  just suck dry well i'm running into a break here so i don't have time to go on and we'll take more
[01:42:54.760 --> 01:43:04.360]  calls after this i talk a lot about the great successes info wars this had i don't think anybody
[01:43:04.360 --> 01:43:10.440]  can deny it and it is because of listeners and viewers supporting us when we talk about the
[01:43:10.440 --> 01:43:16.360]  crew at info wars people behind the scenes the researchers the riders they really have been
[01:43:16.360 --> 01:43:21.560]  the mvps in this fight and we look at harrison smith and oh and shroyer and the hard work they
[01:43:21.560 --> 01:43:28.360]  engage in every day five six seven days a week it's really just incredible so for myself the whole
[01:43:28.360 --> 01:43:34.120]  info wars crew i thank you for your past support i only encourage you now to realize that info wars
[01:43:34.120 --> 01:43:38.600]  cannot stay on air if you do not support us i know you spread the word i know you pray for us
[01:43:38.600 --> 01:43:43.000]  and that's wonderful keep doing it but most viewers and listeners never go to info wars store
[01:43:43.000 --> 01:43:47.480]  dot com and you never buy great products that enrich and empower your life all at the same time
[01:43:47.480 --> 01:43:51.640]  keep us on air i know that less than one percent of our listeners actually go buy products in

[01:43:56.520 --> 01:44:01.560]  our funding problems will be over please take action now mark twain one of america's greatest
[01:44:01.560 --> 01:44:10.520]  riders and satirist in my's famously said more than 150 years ago rumors of his demise had been
[01:44:10.520 --> 01:44:16.040]  greatly exaggerated because the newspapers kept saying he died decades before he did die and it's
[01:44:16.040 --> 01:44:22.440]  the same sci-op today info wars is more influential and more powerful than ever because of your support
[01:44:22.440 --> 01:44:27.240]  because of the facts of what we've covered is coming true but if they can convince you we've been
[01:44:27.240 --> 01:44:32.600]  shut down if they can convince you that we're going away and you stop supporting you stop spreading
[01:44:32.600 --> 01:44:37.960]  the word then they do win ladies and gentlemen there's only one group of people that can shut
[01:44:37.960 --> 01:44:42.520]  down info wars and that's you the viewers and listeners if you decide we're done we're done

[01:47:03.800 --> 01:47:16.120]  world order it's alex jones all right final segment here with me christie lee taking over
[01:47:16.120 --> 01:47:22.920]  hosting sunday night live imagine this headline if donald trump was president petro dollar on
[01:47:22.920 --> 01:47:27.160]  shaky ground saudi arabia willing to discuss selling oil and other currencies so now you're
[01:47:27.160 --> 01:47:32.760]  going to have russia and saudi arabia selling oil and other currencies now imagine if this was
[01:47:32.760 --> 01:47:39.160]  going on when trump was president well i think we all know what the story would be trump selling us
[01:47:39.160 --> 01:47:44.120]  out trumps a foreign agent trumps working with saudi arabia trump russian collusion but when
[01:47:44.120 --> 01:47:50.200]  it's biden mum's the word by the way there's about to be more breaking news on the biden
[01:47:50.200 --> 01:47:53.960]  documents gato and so who's going to come out next in defense is george bush going to admit he
[01:47:53.960 --> 01:47:59.480]  stole secret documents too or maybe maybe uh al gore hunter biden reportedly used delaware house
[01:47:59.480 --> 01:48:06.520]  where classified documents were found as home office yeah the biden crime family all right let's
[01:48:06.520 --> 01:48:11.880]  take a couple more phone calls here final segment let's go to hopper in wisconsin hopper you're on
[01:48:11.880 --> 01:48:19.560]  on the alex jones show go ahead hey oh and uh i was wondering if you heard about uh
[01:48:20.600 --> 01:48:28.440]  jokovic traveling regularly to the pyramids in bosnia greater syria area called uh pyramid of
[01:48:28.440 --> 01:48:35.160]  the moon and pyramid of the sun he says he goes there to recharge his batterings like these pyramids
[01:48:35.160 --> 01:48:40.840]  are like twice as big as the pyramid and uh egypt which are like 500 feet these are like almost
[01:48:40.840 --> 01:48:45.240]  a thousand feet and they look like pyramids like the picture zone they found this like
[01:48:45.240 --> 01:48:51.480]  spear perfectly carved out and giant slabs of course like the other pyramid i thought with uh
[01:48:51.480 --> 01:48:57.720]  you know lunar new new year and the pyramid of the moon and in the moon some people see a rabbit
[01:48:57.720 --> 01:49:03.720]  some people see a face and you know all the nicola tesla stuff you and i have talked about over the
[01:49:03.720 --> 01:49:13.400]  years have you heard about that no i uh had not heard about this but i see this is actually an
[01:49:13.400 --> 01:49:19.480]  older story wimbledon champ novak jokovic inaugurates courts at controversial bosnian pyramids
[01:49:20.040 --> 01:49:24.280]  so i've not heard of that i'm amazed i haven't heard about these bosnian periods if they are such
[01:49:24.280 --> 01:49:29.480]  magnificent structures so uh that's a new one for me i'll uh look into that but maybe there's
[01:49:29.480 --> 01:49:34.360]  something there uh but i wouldn't think you know novak wouldn't keep a secret like that from us he'd
[01:49:34.360 --> 01:49:39.080]  like that oh they're still underground is why you don't hear about them ah no they're above ground
[01:49:39.080 --> 01:49:42.440]  they're above ground they're just buried they look like a hill they're like right well that's
[01:49:42.440 --> 01:49:47.000]  what i mean i mean they're not they haven't been estimated yeah and like you know christianity
[01:49:47.000 --> 01:49:52.120]  talks a lot about the pyramid also you know they say in the bible like the capstone and cornerstone
[01:49:52.120 --> 01:49:57.000]  which i think i actually think and i'm not trying to get to osotere here i actually think there's
[01:49:57.000 --> 01:50:02.920]  many of these pyramids that are still buried like that one in bosnia it you can see that one's pretty
[01:50:02.920 --> 01:50:08.360]  obvious but i think there's many ancient ancient structures that are buried that we don't know about
[01:50:08.360 --> 01:50:11.720]  and and where was that one it came out hopper thanks for the call i don't want to get off track
[01:50:11.720 --> 01:50:15.480]  here but there is the one they they basically excavated this pyramid they didn't even know
[01:50:15.480 --> 01:50:19.240]  it was there they thought it was just a little mound and they ended up excavating it and it was
[01:50:19.240 --> 01:50:23.320]  like a thousand feet tall and so there have been a couple cases like that i think there's a lot of
[01:50:23.320 --> 01:50:30.280]  that human history still out there hidden from us all right let's go to shon in california shon
[01:50:30.280 --> 01:50:36.920]  you're on the air go ahead hey on how you read me am i coming out and clear yeah we got you clear
[01:50:37.880 --> 01:50:43.160]  awesome sauce hey uh four quick stories here so i don't take too much of your time one is a quick
[01:50:43.160 --> 01:50:47.400]  and easy one it's a karma story down the road for me is a bookstore that was doing the drag queen
[01:50:47.400 --> 01:50:51.800]  story time oh well it seems that uh they're not going to have their release renewed and they're
[01:50:51.800 --> 01:50:58.840]  going to have to find a new location darn what a shame yeah i know i'm i'm crying a clown tears for
[01:50:58.840 --> 01:51:06.360]  them um second thing is with uh the polosi incident with paul polosi getting hammered and not with
[01:51:06.360 --> 01:51:13.400]  uh alcohol um it would appear that you know the the media is trying to portray his attacker is
[01:51:13.400 --> 01:51:19.800]  a quote unquote qanon guy and every time there's something that pops up they use the qanon angle
[01:51:19.800 --> 01:51:24.440]  as their scapegoat now whether it's the guy blocking off the bridge uh by havasu with the armored
[01:51:24.440 --> 01:51:30.920]  truck or protesters at the capital or this guy it's funny how they're always like a left wing
[01:51:30.920 --> 01:51:35.240]  or a year before they disappear off the map and then they come back as qanon it's almost as if uh
[01:51:35.240 --> 01:51:40.360]  someone had a program going on just saying well look that's why i i didn't want to get too conspiratorial
[01:51:40.360 --> 01:51:45.640]  with this i said maybe you've got like a justy small that type of situation or something similar but
[01:51:45.640 --> 01:51:50.200]  i mean look based off what we've seen it appears that yeah i mean he broke in he wanted to hold
[01:51:50.200 --> 01:51:55.640]  polosi hostage was it some giant act i mean that'd be the one conspiracy theory i guess i'd be willing
[01:51:55.640 --> 01:52:02.280]  to uh you know hear out but it's there's definitely weirdness uh him and his underwear him with the
[01:52:02.280 --> 01:52:07.880]  drink you know them both coming to the door i you know i don't know well it's just the media
[01:52:07.880 --> 01:52:14.440]  goes to it as a default and that's okay with that no no i'm fine that call him a qanon guy i agree
[01:52:14.440 --> 01:52:20.600]  let's find out who qanon is because exactly they like to use qanon now as this boogie man
[01:52:20.600 --> 01:52:25.720]  qanon the ultimate scapegoat but then who is qanon then oh let's just oh it's the perfect
[01:52:25.720 --> 01:52:30.040]  boogie man it's the perfect thing to blame for everything and then and then cast the entire
[01:52:30.040 --> 01:52:35.720]  trump support net over like we're they're all qanon no no i want to know who qanon is good
[01:52:35.720 --> 01:52:41.000]  go ahead find out tell us who qanon is say de pappy is qanon no no no my guess is it's the fbi
[01:52:41.000 --> 01:52:44.120]  and that's why they don't want you to know about it shon i'm sorry i gotta jump we have too many
[01:52:44.120 --> 01:52:54.040]  other calls uh let's go to john in florida john go ahead hello owin hi can you hear me yes look i
[01:52:54.040 --> 01:53:03.080]  got a uh a scenario i want your opinion on my uh my step uh my my great great grandson they moved
[01:53:03.080 --> 01:53:09.960]  in here with us my my step orders going through divorce and and she had to start him in in in uh
[01:53:09.960 --> 01:53:18.360]  uh and kindergarten and where my son went uh uh school at and uh he's riding the bus uh friday
[01:53:18.920 --> 01:53:24.760]  and and some white kid picks on him and i don't know where he picked up the word from but he calls
[01:53:24.760 --> 01:53:32.840]  him the n word so now they're uh banding off the bus a six year old they're banding him off the
[01:53:32.840 --> 01:53:41.560]  school bus uh we're the least uh uh systemic uh race people you'd ever want to meet my sister was
[01:53:41.560 --> 01:53:49.080]  married to a black man and my and his grandmother dated three black men and for them to pull this
[01:53:49.080 --> 01:53:54.840]  little kid off when uh you know kids say things they don't need to say i don't know where he picked
[01:53:54.840 --> 01:54:01.000]  it up from but they're pulling him off the bus is that fair well i mean i look there there seems to
[01:54:01.000 --> 01:54:05.960]  be a lot forget about the family history or whatever you know the situation the context
[01:54:05.960 --> 01:54:10.200]  of whatever went on in the bus i mean i i i don't i you know i don't even think i can offer a fair
[01:54:10.200 --> 01:54:17.320]  opinion on that but hearing you talk about that you know i i wonder how many other words he could
[01:54:17.320 --> 01:54:21.560]  say and not get kicked out of the bus it but i wouldn't suggest that social experiment no there
[01:54:21.560 --> 01:54:26.920]  was a situation though where a top high school quarterback the crew already has it up on the
[01:54:26.920 --> 01:54:32.760]  screen these guys are in my head hbcu coach apologizes after offering scholarship to student
[01:54:32.760 --> 01:54:41.400]  dropped by florida for rapping n word so marcus stokes was a top high school quarterback recruit
[01:54:42.040 --> 01:54:49.880]  got a scholarship from florida revoked because he was rapping to a song that used the n word
[01:54:49.880 --> 01:54:56.120]  and was then given a scholarship by a hbcu a historically black black college so i mean a
[01:54:56.120 --> 01:54:59.960]  black college offered him a scholarship obviously didn't care much about the n word hey can you
[01:54:59.960 --> 01:55:04.760]  play football yep your receivers are black do you care nope all right let's play some football
[01:55:04.760 --> 01:55:13.320]  oh no no no now they've taken away his scholarship so i mean look i it's this whole policing of
[01:55:13.320 --> 01:55:17.720]  language and it's gets like okay the n word is like the most offensive thing you can say now and
[01:55:17.720 --> 01:55:23.480]  again it all goes back to the last caller why don't they want everything is trans but they'll
[01:55:23.480 --> 01:55:30.200]  never accept trans race why because they love that dividing line they love keeping the races
[01:55:30.200 --> 01:55:34.360]  apart so if you're trans race well then marcus stokes could just identify as black and he
[01:55:34.360 --> 01:55:37.480]  could use the n word as much as he wants well the left doesn't want love they don't want that
[01:55:37.480 --> 01:55:41.560]  because they want to use that to destroy you see that would take way too many tools out of their
[01:55:41.560 --> 01:55:47.640]  arsenal to go down that road and so they just simply don't all right let's take one more caller
[01:55:47.640 --> 01:55:54.680]  let's go to marcus in idaho final caller tonight marcus go ahead hello oh and um i'll make this quick
[01:55:54.680 --> 01:56:02.600]  um the f a uh hack that happened uh recently about three weeks ago i think it was ai i think it was
[01:56:02.600 --> 01:56:10.280]  ai hacking ai and if that is true that um gives us huge consequences across the world because they
[01:56:10.280 --> 01:56:17.720]  are going to uh they're where does it stop from there and but itch itch um what is he gonna say
[01:56:17.720 --> 01:56:25.400]  he's just gonna smile and say well i've gotta go on paternity leave um so i like that too i've been
[01:56:25.400 --> 01:56:33.480]  calling him booty judge i kind of like that but it itch but it yes you know pete but itch yeah i
[01:56:33.480 --> 01:56:39.960]  can get behind that yeah and you know i've got to say that um alex jones keeps on saying we're
[01:56:39.960 --> 01:56:47.080]  winning um i i don't think we are um ronnie mcdaniel romney has uh just been put back into the place
[01:56:47.640 --> 01:56:55.000]  the whole system that we have is really broken now and sometimes sometimes the system collapsing
[01:56:55.000 --> 01:56:59.720]  is signs of victory and there's no doubt they're in their death rows right now going for more control
[01:56:59.720 --> 01:57:05.560]  by the way romney romney mcdaniel basically knew how unpopular she was you know the first thing she
[01:57:05.560 --> 01:57:10.360]  did after winning was announced that she's never running again so she's done after this so she's
[01:57:10.360 --> 01:57:16.120]  had two years and i'm out and i think she got the message when after the vote took place all the media
[01:57:16.120 --> 01:57:21.160]  went to harm eat dylan and all the media went to mike lindell and nobody wanted to hear from
[01:57:21.160 --> 01:57:25.640]  mcdaniel so she got the message there but i i get it it's the best of times it's the worst of
[01:57:25.640 --> 01:57:31.160]  times it's the it's the we're living that paradox no doubt but i i do think we're winning i do think
[01:57:31.160 --> 01:57:36.920]  the good in humanity rises up right before it's too late to save this planet and save civilization
[01:57:36.920 --> 01:57:41.400]  all right that does it for the alex joneshow this sunday stay tuned live though at info wars dot
