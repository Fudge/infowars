[02:02.920 --> 02:11.040]  Alex Jones your host again thank you for joining us all right I have been
[02:11.040 --> 02:14.480]  saying for the last five months that I believe that they are going to stage
[02:14.480 --> 02:23.720]  terror attacks on government buildings IRS military bases specifically Paul
[02:23.720 --> 02:33.840]  Watson wrote an article yesterday breaking this down in fact guys I
[02:33.840 --> 02:37.800]  didn't reprint that article the article the way to find it is it says as
[02:37.800 --> 02:44.200]  predicted Pentagon shooting blamed on 911 truth and it's the first link there it
[02:44.200 --> 02:50.640]  says on Wednesday and then that's the link to the report where we predict
[02:50.640 --> 02:55.840]  things like this are about to happen and take place and now you know there's
[02:55.840 --> 03:00.240]  been a Pentagon shooting last night where the reported shooter was killed and
[03:00.240 --> 03:04.600]  two police officers Pentagon Defense Force a Pentagon protective service were
[03:04.600 --> 03:08.440]  wounded one on the shoulder one on the thigh and this may be a lone nut but
[03:08.440 --> 03:13.840]  here's the problem I've seen Chris Matthews and Glenn Beck and others with
[03:13.840 --> 03:20.120]  the talking point the last few months that 911 truth is violent and that 911
[03:20.120 --> 03:29.520]  truth is going to attack and it has been declassified that our government and
[03:29.520 --> 03:33.720]  many other governments have staged countless terror attacks against their
[03:33.720 --> 03:39.200]  own people in the past as a way to create a police state culture with disdain
[03:39.200 --> 03:44.400]  and hatred by the military and police and mistrust not just hatred of the
[03:44.400 --> 03:51.400]  public and this guy who it now turns out was reportedly on medication had been
[03:51.400 --> 03:57.440]  depressed this graduate student drives across the country and then walks up
[03:57.440 --> 04:04.160]  stone-faced and shoots these two officers before he was killed the biggest
[04:04.160 --> 04:08.880]  issue here is there's been a media talking point out of the blue out of the
[04:08.880 --> 04:15.720]  wild blue yonder out of nowhere saying 911 truth is going to attack 911 truth
[04:15.720 --> 04:20.160]  is violent they work for Al Qaeda when on record Al Qaeda was set up by the U.S.
[04:20.160 --> 04:28.400]  government in 1979 it's a big news in ski that founded it brags about it and the
[04:28.400 --> 04:32.920]  Joe stack attack of a few weeks ago just unbelievable evidence that was staged we
[04:32.920 --> 04:37.560]  know the underwear bombing was staged they got him on the plane protecting our
[04:37.560 --> 04:42.160]  witnesses like Kurt Haskell were eyewitnesses to it on the Christmas
[04:42.160 --> 04:46.240]  Day underwear attack then it came out that the CIA ordered the state department
[04:46.240 --> 04:50.480]  to let that guy on the plane some type of security personnel got him past
[04:50.480 --> 04:56.960]  security past the body scanners in Amsterdam on to the plane and then now
[04:56.960 --> 05:00.960]  you have this I mean this is just incredible stay with us this is Alex
[05:00.960 --> 05:04.040]  Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power
[05:04.040 --> 05:07.960]  generator number one new climate legislation could easily double or
[05:07.960 --> 05:12.200]  triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control how
[05:12.200 --> 05:16.480]  much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total government
[05:16.480 --> 05:20.840]  control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming number
[05:20.840 --> 05:24.920]  three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and
[05:24.920 --> 05:29.480]  now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four
[05:29.480 --> 05:33.600]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of
[05:33.600 --> 05:37.600]  families lose their power from weather related onages number five a solar power
[05:37.600 --> 05:41.400]  generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks I
[05:41.400 --> 05:44.120]  really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions from
[05:44.120 --> 05:50.120]  science one of my oldest sponsors you can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com
[05:50.120 --> 05:54.800]  that's my solar backup.com remember the government doesn't own the Sun so go to

[08:45.680 --> 08:51.360]  was a Pentagon shooting last night and the news media went around the web
[08:51.360 --> 08:57.440]  within hours and found reported text comments by this guy questioning the
[08:57.440 --> 09:05.200]  wars and the official story of 9-11 that's just like when Poplowski and
[09:05.200 --> 09:10.120]  Hitsburg shot the three cops it turned out it was a domestic dispute turned out
[09:10.120 --> 09:13.920]  the guy hated me and had been all over the web attacking me we forced five
[09:13.920 --> 09:21.000]  newspapers to print retractions but not before they ran with headlines that he
[09:21.000 --> 09:28.000]  was an Alex Jones fan killed three cops within two hours of his arrest when he
[09:28.000 --> 09:34.560]  gave up in his mother's home the local writer who writes puff pieces for the
[09:34.560 --> 09:41.640]  ADL and Southern Prairie Law Center in the Pittsburgh Post Gazette had the IP
[09:41.640 --> 09:45.480]  addresses of the websites he was visiting we later got the full list CNN
[09:45.480 --> 09:50.240]  Fox News you name it and the world was told cop killer loves Alex Jones turned
[09:50.240 --> 09:55.200]  out he was actually attacking me and didn't like me because we don't believe
[09:55.200 --> 09:59.680]  that Jews are the source of all evil on the planet and then he thought I was an
[09:59.680 --> 10:06.720]  evil operative of Israel or something I am the main enemy of the Southern
[10:06.720 --> 10:11.880]  Prairie Law Center and the ADL and I'm in reports every week now they put out
[10:11.880 --> 10:17.200]  demonizing me Newsweek Time Magazine New York Times just there's new
[10:17.200 --> 10:25.800]  publications every day attacking yours truly and they lie about me they say I
[10:25.800 --> 10:32.520]  believe aliens control the planet don't talk about space aliens they say that
[10:32.680 --> 10:37.680]  well they just build strong men they just say ridiculous things about me that
[10:37.680 --> 10:46.040]  I haven't said in an attempt to discredit me but really all it does is make more
[10:46.040 --> 10:51.680]  people go to info wars.com more people go to prison planet.com and find out
[10:51.680 --> 10:55.200]  what we're really talking about and now these groups are going after mainline
[10:55.200 --> 10:59.960]  people like Congressman Tom Tancredo former congressman Michelle Bachman
[10:59.960 --> 11:06.840]  Ron Paul mainline groups that you know they mixed me in with Sarah Palin and
[11:06.840 --> 11:11.280]  people and so they're really losing all credibility it's kind of like CNN and
[11:11.280 --> 11:15.920]  MSNBC with the talking point that if you don't like government health care you
[11:15.920 --> 11:19.320]  secretly hate black people you're like what does it have to do with black
[11:19.320 --> 11:29.320]  people but in every case now over and over again within hours the mainstream
[11:29.320 --> 11:33.680]  media singles Alex Jones out Joe Stack flies that plane into a building two
[11:33.680 --> 11:39.800]  weeks ago within three hours the New York Daily News the Austin American
[11:39.800 --> 11:48.560]  statesman and and literally scores of other publications said that very
[11:48.560 --> 11:52.960]  deceptively they would put a line about many people support what happened like
[11:52.960 --> 11:59.040]  blogger Alex Jones in the next sentence so it legally they're not saying I did
[11:59.040 --> 12:02.840]  it but the average person reads it as if I'm supporting what happened when of
[12:02.840 --> 12:06.960]  course we decried it from the moment go and said watch they'll be blaming it on
[12:06.960 --> 12:12.320]  me within hours and then within hours they were blaming it on me I even saw
[12:12.320 --> 12:16.160]  one blog minutes after I went on air they put a blog out I saw a few days
[12:16.160 --> 12:19.120]  later going look at Jones he said they're gonna blame it on the tea party
[12:19.120 --> 12:22.320]  this crazy nut makes everything about him he says they're gonna blame it on
[12:22.320 --> 12:29.360]  him and then I was absolutely right hours later I mean look I mean I'm on
[12:29.360 --> 12:33.640]  the receiving end of this but Ploskey kills three cops because he's drunk at
[12:33.640 --> 12:37.360]  7 a.m. in the morning has got two pit bulls urinating everywhere he's an ex
[12:37.360 --> 12:41.480]  Marine his mother comes and says you're I'm throwing you out of the house she
[12:41.480 --> 12:45.840]  calls the cops on him he throws a fit and shoots three of them and within two
[12:45.840 --> 12:50.040]  hours of him giving up I don't know why they even let him give up
[12:53.040 --> 12:57.000]  my issue is if you do shoot three people in cold blood I don't know what
[12:57.000 --> 13:02.760]  whatever I guess his mother was in the house but within two hours of him being
[13:02.760 --> 13:10.600]  in custody I'm being blamed for it then it turned out it was the opposite and you
[13:10.600 --> 13:13.800]  have to ask yourself why are we under this level of attack because we
[13:13.800 --> 13:21.200]  understand how the new order works we have their number remember two years
[13:21.200 --> 13:25.800]  ago Jeremy Tallis we are changed New York political activist against the
[13:25.800 --> 13:30.800]  globalist totally peaceful you know Gandhi is their mascot be the change you
[13:30.800 --> 13:35.560]  want to see in the world that's a we are changed that's a Gandhi quote
[13:35.560 --> 13:46.600]  Jeremy Tallis is going to protest outside Laura Bush for the 9-11 workers
[13:46.600 --> 13:51.400]  police firemen and others dying from the deadly dust and out of an alleyway and I
[13:51.400 --> 13:53.800]  talked to four or five witnesses that were there and I didn't just believe
[13:53.800 --> 13:57.720]  Jeremy here comes this man screaming don't attack my daughter before he even
[13:57.720 --> 14:07.720]  runs into Jeremy with the wheelchair ramming him screaming don't attack
[14:07.720 --> 14:12.320]  don't attack and they had cops run out and stage an arrest but then the secret
[14:12.320 --> 14:16.400]  service got on the stand and said no it's not true he didn't attack anybody but
[14:16.400 --> 14:20.560]  they went to trial they had to refuse the plea bargain and face five years in
[14:20.560 --> 14:25.120]  prison and my listeners raised them some money people are saying how dare you
[14:25.120 --> 14:29.080]  Jones defend someone that would attack a little girl in a wheelchair talk about
[14:29.080 --> 14:32.360]  a Psyop I mean they sit there and think and turn out the guy did contracts with
[14:32.360 --> 14:38.960]  Bush and works with the Republicans that did it highly connected imagine me in
[14:38.960 --> 14:42.280]  the globalist okay how do we demonize 9-11 truth these people are confronting
[14:42.280 --> 14:47.960]  world leaders in New York Chicago LA Dallas every major city they're
[14:47.960 --> 14:53.000]  confronting Al Gore about climate fraud this 9-11 truth group has branched out
[14:53.000 --> 14:59.480]  into all frauds exposing all frauds fake climate garbage global government
[14:59.480 --> 15:03.520]  NAFTA cat and they're going to all these events and asking serious questions
[15:03.520 --> 15:07.760]  well what do we do we have somebody come out of an alleyway and start ramming
[15:07.760 --> 15:12.000]  them with a little girl in a wheelchair and then the New York Post had a
[15:12.000 --> 15:18.480]  printer retraction so we're attacking girls in wheelchairs we're supporting
[15:18.480 --> 15:23.480]  cop killers we're praising planes being flown to IRS buildings none of it true
[15:23.480 --> 15:32.920]  and they just grasp it straws and try to do anything they can and deceptively
[15:32.920 --> 15:39.680]  edit video from events and things to do anything they can to make us look bad
[15:39.680 --> 15:45.240]  because they're scared now there's no 9-11 truth violence anywhere in history
[15:45.240 --> 15:52.680]  and then suddenly all the major talking heads in the last few months starts
[15:52.680 --> 15:56.840]  saying 9-11 truth is going to kill Obama in the White House 9-11 truth is
[15:56.840 --> 16:00.640]  going to attack military bases 9-11 truth is going to attack government
[16:00.640 --> 16:08.440]  buildings and then wallah wallah a 9-11 truth are supposedly and they know this
[16:08.440 --> 16:12.240]  within hours from stuff on the internet who knows if it's real or not just
[16:12.240 --> 16:16.880]  postings on message boards kind of like they always say bin Laden says he's
[16:16.880 --> 16:20.920]  going to attack us again today in a new text message on a website and then two
[16:20.920 --> 16:27.080]  weeks later oh that wasn't real like a peel run headlines saying Al Qaeda
[16:27.080 --> 16:30.640]  leader says he's going to attack again and at the bottom of the article say
[16:30.640 --> 16:38.160]  this message was not confirmed and you catch the CIA run Intel Center uploading
[16:38.160 --> 16:43.680]  bin Laden and Adam Gadan videos and other videos in the same video layer as
[16:43.680 --> 16:47.200]  their logo the Al Qaeda logo is in the same video layer meaning was uploaded
[16:47.200 --> 16:53.400]  produced in the same place they have linguists that listen to the audio
[16:53.400 --> 16:59.800]  tapes of bin Laden not him it can't even pass voice key identification they're so
[16:59.800 --> 17:03.920]  lazy in the government they've got software where they can fake voices if
[17:03.920 --> 17:06.520]  they have a recording of it they don't even do that they just it's not even the
[17:06.520 --> 17:11.000]  same dialect they just think you're they put that blurred video out in 2002 of a
[17:11.000 --> 17:17.200]  fat guy in a cave with a nose twice the size of bin Laden's and then face print
[17:17.200 --> 17:22.480]  was done it wasn't even him as if you needed a face print to know that I mean
[17:22.480 --> 17:31.080]  that's how stupid they think you are and so out of the wild blue yonder and Paul
[17:31.080 --> 17:35.160]  Watson's got a new article that he just wrote about this that just now went up
[17:35.160 --> 17:46.520]  on prisonplanet.com they are reporting that this Pentagon shooter was a
[17:46.520 --> 17:52.160]  anti-government person yes and so now the police everybody need to be real
[17:52.160 --> 17:59.520]  scared of any 9-11 truthers because they're gonna get you see Glenn Beckin
[17:59.520 --> 18:04.200]  Chris Matthews they were right how did they know how did they know this was
[18:04.200 --> 18:08.520]  gonna happen now there's a small percentage chance they're weak-minded
[18:08.520 --> 18:13.840]  easily suggestible people and they've done studies they know of the media gets

[24:20.920 --> 24:30.400]  here's a short clip from just some of the news coverage last night from CBS now he
[24:30.400 --> 24:34.160]  calmly just walked up and reportedly did this I wonder if they'll ban the
[24:34.160 --> 24:38.200]  release of all the surveillance camera video like they did on the Pentagon
[24:38.200 --> 24:41.280]  attack on 9-11 let's go ahead and play a clip of this
[24:41.280 --> 24:47.680]  he was very calm there was no distress in his appearance he walked very very
[24:47.680 --> 24:51.280]  directly to the officers and engaged police say he approached a pair of
[24:51.280 --> 24:55.160]  Pentagon police officers and appeared to be reaching for an ID when he opened
[24:55.160 --> 25:00.520]  fire shots were fired between both both of our officers stained injuries that
[25:00.520 --> 25:06.800]  were minor mon mon life-threatening the suspect was struck in the head his
[25:06.800 --> 25:10.480]  injuries were a lot more severe the shootings happened at point blank range
[25:10.480 --> 25:15.440]  multiple shots were exchanged Fidel who was not wearing body armor was hit once
[25:15.440 --> 25:19.960]  in the head and once in the shoulder the officers sustained minor wounds one
[25:19.960 --> 25:23.840]  hidden the thigh the other in the shoulder the two officers now identified
[25:23.840 --> 25:27.480]  as John Amos and Marvin caraway have both been treated for their injuries and
[25:27.480 --> 25:32.440]  released police say bedel apparently acted alone but his motive remains somewhat
[25:32.440 --> 25:37.080]  of a mystery he reportedly had a history of depression and a person with the same
[25:37.080 --> 25:41.360]  name had posted anti-military rants and doubts about the 9-11 attacks on the
[25:41.360 --> 25:45.600]  internet along with this video on YouTube I'm happy to have the opportunity
[25:45.600 --> 25:50.280]  to talk with you today about information currency the invention that I've released
[25:50.280 --> 25:55.280]  to the public on Twitter CBS radio affiliate KNX posted this quote his
[25:55.280 --> 25:59.760]  father tells me his son is a grad student at San Jose State but says his son
[25:59.760 --> 26:04.080]  has been slipping all right and now it's coming out he'd been in psychiatric
[26:04.080 --> 26:08.960]  care reportedly and taking some type of anti-psychotics they they always are
[26:08.960 --> 26:14.240]  when it's a real shooting because it puts you into a dreamlike state it's now on
[26:14.240 --> 26:22.080]  the drug inserts for Prozac and other serotonin reuptake inhibitors that the
[26:22.080 --> 26:27.240]  drugs can cause psychotic behavior or suicide so we don't know if this was
[26:27.240 --> 26:33.880]  real or staged but here's another issue in operation Northwoods reported on by
[26:33.880 --> 26:39.840]  ABC news and the Associated Press as well as the Baltimore Sun headline US
[26:39.840 --> 26:44.000]  government plan to stage terror attacks in US cities another headline
[26:44.000 --> 26:50.000]  government secret plan to terrorize US cities and it called in Miami and DC of
[26:50.000 --> 26:57.480]  all places to stage shootings of military personnel who are in black ops to
[26:57.480 --> 27:04.160]  graze them or to actually not tell them and actually kill them they also talked
[27:04.160 --> 27:08.080]  about doing it at Guantanamo Bay with US army forces dressed up like humans
[27:08.080 --> 27:12.880]  that was from the 60s to attack the base and it was declassified two weeks ago
[27:12.880 --> 27:18.640]  that back during the Kennedy era Bobby Kennedy proposed bombing the US embassy
[27:18.640 --> 27:24.840]  in Honduras as a pretext to invade Honduras so there's just example after
[27:24.840 --> 27:30.800]  example of this and when you have declassified government plans to stage
[27:30.800 --> 27:37.560]  shootings of their own personnel as a pretext to have police state crackdowns
[27:37.560 --> 27:43.080]  or demonize a particular group you've got to pay attention I mean I mean where
[27:43.080 --> 27:45.800]  did Glenn Beck get off where did Chris Matthews get off and all these other
[27:45.800 --> 27:49.960]  hosts with a talking point the last two and a half months that 9 11 truth will
[27:49.960 --> 27:57.600]  try to kill the president 9 11 truth will try to attack military bases 9 11
[27:57.600 --> 28:03.120]  truth and then suddenly off of some message board comments under the same
[28:03.120 --> 28:07.480]  name anybody could have framed this guy well folks we have no idea what the
[28:07.480 --> 28:12.680]  truth is government lies so much has staged so many other events we just
[28:12.680 --> 28:19.840]  don't know we know the underwear bombing was a staged event it came out we
[28:19.840 --> 28:22.880]  written articles about it info wars.com and present planet.com the State
[28:22.880 --> 28:27.000]  Department was in several newspapers but it didn't become national news drudge
[28:27.000 --> 28:33.920]  report of all places did link to it the Detroit News and others reported that the
[28:33.920 --> 28:37.960]  State Department was ordered by a US intelligence agency to protect him and
[28:37.960 --> 28:43.360]  to help him get on the plane without a passport in Amsterdam for his flight to
[28:43.360 --> 28:48.280]  the US on Christmas Day and Kurt Haskell day one came out with his wife who's
[28:48.280 --> 28:53.400]  also a lawyer and said look somebody in a sharp dress suit went up right in
[28:53.400 --> 28:56.800]  front of me I was by the gate and said look I've already got him through
[28:56.800 --> 29:00.400]  security without a passport I'm authorized he went and talked to other
[29:00.400 --> 29:08.000]  supervisors in front of him and said let him on the plane and this person was so
[29:08.000 --> 29:12.760]  high powered that without any ID the underwear bomber got on the plane then
[29:12.760 --> 29:17.000]  once on the plane someone was videotaping from four aisles back the
[29:17.000 --> 29:21.880]  underwear bomber the entire time and passengers wondered why the camera was
[29:21.880 --> 29:27.320]  trained on him then they get him off the plane in Detroit they take him into
[29:27.320 --> 29:31.040]  customs they they announced they found a bomb the dog runs over to the bag they
[29:31.040 --> 29:35.080]  arrest somebody else and then Kurt Haskell told his story other witnesses
[29:35.080 --> 29:40.000]  came up and backed him up then the FBI said he was a liar and then a month
[29:40.000 --> 29:44.240]  later admitted it was all true and they helped him get on the plane now what is
[29:44.240 --> 29:48.680]  that that's a staged event to sell the naked body scanners and a lot more we'll
[29:48.680 --> 29:56.320]  be right back we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the

[33:06.080 --> 33:12.760]  welcome back ladies and gentlemen look at this deceptive headline from Fox news
[33:12.760 --> 33:18.960]  Pentagon shooter railed against us on the internet so the idea is he hated
[33:18.960 --> 33:26.880]  America whoever he was they always call the government and the IRS the US no
[33:26.880 --> 33:31.200]  that's not the US that's part of the parasite foreign offshore system that's
[33:31.200 --> 33:35.040]  hijacked our country and is destroying the Bill of Rights and Constitution in
[33:35.040 --> 33:40.400]  front of everyone and then they go on to say that it's his messages but then
[33:40.400 --> 33:47.840]  later they admit well they can't confirm that this was the same Jay Patrick that
[33:47.840 --> 33:52.920]  did this I mean it's so easy to frame somebody you just post something on a
[33:52.920 --> 33:57.920]  comment board you go out and commit a crime and then the person that supposedly
[33:57.920 --> 34:04.680]  did it is killed conveniently and take Austin with Joe Stack turns out that one
[34:04.680 --> 34:10.840]  of the top defense contractors that runs the remote control systems for the
[34:10.840 --> 34:18.520]  predator drones and other systems that a homeland security operative with that
[34:18.520 --> 34:22.840]  company owned the small hangar that Joe Stax plane was in and then you have all
[34:22.840 --> 34:26.560]  the witnesses saying the emergency crews were out there beforehand and that
[34:26.560 --> 34:31.720]  there was no one in the small plane as it flew over the highway multiple
[34:31.720 --> 34:35.000]  witnesses and now that's all been confirmed that multiple witnesses saw
[34:35.000 --> 34:40.360]  no one in the plane and that the witnesses were also correct about scores
[34:40.360 --> 34:45.360]  of fire trucks and emergency police and firemen from all over the county for an
[34:45.360 --> 34:52.160]  unscheduled drill that had never happened before in that location and it goes
[34:52.160 --> 34:58.280]  on and on and then within hours they demonize the tea party and then now
[34:58.280 --> 35:04.440]  this happens and within hours it's 9-11 truth and you have a government that has
[35:04.440 --> 35:08.400]  been caught staging terror attacks all over the world it came out two years
[35:08.400 --> 35:14.840]  ago that a year before that three years ago total Dick Cheney had planned to
[35:14.840 --> 35:20.400]  have Navy SEALs with fake Iranian patrol boats attack US ships in the
[35:20.400 --> 35:27.840]  Strait of Hormuz to blame it on Iran for World War three and then it turned out
[35:27.840 --> 35:32.360]  right at that time there were fake radio transmissions from blue patrol boats
[35:32.360 --> 35:36.240]  that it turned out were not from Iran and the media said oh it was just some
[35:36.240 --> 35:41.080]  pranker yeah a pranker in blue boats broadcasting we're gonna blow your ships
[35:41.080 --> 35:44.600]  up that weren't Iranian right at the time it's been declassified Cheney was
[35:44.600 --> 35:52.880]  proposing it and remember 888 you wake up CNN's reporting Georgia has been
[35:52.880 --> 35:56.760]  attacked by Russia Georgia has been attacked and then all over the foreign
[35:56.760 --> 36:04.160]  news British French it was confirmed that Georgian US backed forces attack
[36:04.160 --> 36:10.840]  South Ossetia the Russian-controlled enclave and went and that they used
[36:10.840 --> 36:17.040]  peacekeeper troops with the UN who were Georgian to hang grenade people inside
[36:17.040 --> 36:22.520]  the multinational bases literally Russians are standing at guard and people
[36:22.520 --> 36:25.800]  run up and slit their throats and throw hang grenades into their barracks I
[36:25.800 --> 36:30.960]  mean total sneak attack on record CNN later had to admit that it was true that
[36:30.960 --> 36:36.720]  well Georgia attacked this area but the Russians overreacted oh really they
[36:36.720 --> 36:40.760]  came in kicked them out and withdrew and I'm not saying the Russians are choir
[36:40.760 --> 36:45.320]  boys they're certainly corrupt and big government's bad just like the Iranians
[36:45.320 --> 36:50.760]  are corrupt just like every country on earth there's evil in high places is
[36:50.760 --> 36:55.440]  bad but who's the big empire America run by the private banks I mean I was
[36:55.440 --> 36:58.120]  driving in this morning listening to Bloomberg financial and it was
[36:58.120 --> 37:02.200]  reporting things already knew but just to hear it then I flipped to CNBC same
[37:02.200 --> 37:07.120]  thing record bonuses record profits the only part of the economy doing good as
[37:07.120 --> 37:14.720]  the banks as Greece and 15 other nations prepare to go completely under that's who
[37:14.720 --> 37:19.280]  runs our government is those banks they call the shots they write the
[37:19.280 --> 37:25.440]  legislation the banks wrote the greenhouse gas tax legislation where
[37:25.440 --> 37:32.040]  they'll be paid the money I mean it's just unspeakable how obvious all of this
[37:32.040 --> 37:41.240]  is I mean it's on record but a key article from Paul Joseph Watson of a
[37:41.240 --> 37:47.240]  prison planet calm as predicted Pentagon shooting blamed on 911 truth and the
[37:47.240 --> 37:51.040]  shooting also happened right as the Supreme Court is in deliberations for
[37:51.040 --> 37:55.840]  their ruling today then they'll announce it in a few months but they're in closed
[37:55.840 --> 38:00.520]  door meetings yesterday and today on the second amendment and right on me and
[38:00.520 --> 38:03.040]  even Limbaugh's pointed out that every time they're trying to pass a gun bill
[38:03.040 --> 38:07.360]  you have some bizarre mass shooting and if you don't know governments don't
[38:07.360 --> 38:12.760]  stage stuff you're not living in reality speaking of the Russians they've been
[38:12.760 --> 38:16.160]  caught doing it over and over again Hitler did it the communist Chinese did
[38:16.160 --> 38:22.080]  it false flag terror is one of the main tools if you've got a big empire and you
[38:22.080 --> 38:25.360]  want to invade other countries or crack down on domestic groups you stage
[38:25.360 --> 38:30.680]  stuff and blame it on them it's called a frame up by the way every two or three
[38:30.680 --> 38:34.240]  days I see a new YouTube video of police on their own squad car videos
[38:34.240 --> 38:39.520]  planting drugs on people so if you don't think that big government will plant
[38:39.520 --> 38:46.680]  terror attacks you're not living in reality by the way coming up later when
[38:46.680 --> 38:50.200]  Bob Chapman's on with someone to get into some video clips for body watching
[38:50.200 --> 38:55.160]  at prison planet TV and audio for radio listeners in New York City and in the
[38:55.160 --> 39:02.640]  state of New Mexico internal memos have come out admitting what we already knew
[39:02.640 --> 39:07.880]  every major police department state police you name it has quotas quotas on
[39:07.880 --> 39:15.160]  arrest quotas on DWI quotas on tickets and every time police complain they say
[39:15.160 --> 39:20.200]  you're a conspiracy theorist you're not told there's a quota and the commander
[39:20.200 --> 39:25.480]  of the state police sits there on TV saying this is not a quota you're just
[39:25.480 --> 39:28.920]  ordered to give out this many tickets and then they go to the actual definition
[39:28.920 --> 39:34.600]  of a quote and it is a quote folks the government normally lies most of what
[39:34.600 --> 39:40.960]  you hear is lies or spin they do it out of hand and people are finally starting
[39:40.960 --> 39:43.600]  to figure this out but I don't think the public's figuring out just how bad
[39:43.600 --> 39:48.440]  they are look if it's been declassified in the last 30 40 years really last 50
[39:48.440 --> 39:55.800]  that through the 40s 50s 60s 70s 80s 90s right until today they're constantly
[39:55.800 --> 40:01.000]  admitting oh yeah we marched troops into a nerve gas chamber and killed them and
[40:01.000 --> 40:05.320]  dissected their bodies and told their families they died of flu yeah we put
[40:05.320 --> 40:09.240]  troops on ships and sprayed uranium on them most of them died within a year
[40:09.240 --> 40:14.720]  yeah we took foster kids and radiated into death I mean literally thousands of
[40:14.720 --> 40:18.960]  news headlines where the government admits this giving black men syphilis
[40:18.960 --> 40:24.520]  just on and on and on on and on and on and on and on and then oh but the
[40:24.520 --> 40:31.240]  government wouldn't stage a shooting at the Pentagon no the government wouldn't
[40:31.240 --> 40:38.720]  and then it came out two weeks ago the government documents were released that
[40:38.720 --> 40:44.760]  Dick Cheney in White House Minutes wanted to have nuclear war on 888 2008
[40:44.760 --> 40:50.800]  with Russia I mean these people are out of their minds yeah they're crazy like a
[40:50.800 --> 40:55.360]  fox they there's a method of their madness but they're so confident they've
[40:55.360 --> 40:59.640]  gotten away with so much that's what criminals always go too far but these
[40:59.640 --> 41:05.040]  are criminals that have all the power and so how far will they go with Iran how
[41:05.040 --> 41:10.880]  far will they go domestically and again I would say this is probably a lone nut
[41:10.880 --> 41:18.840]  at the Pentagon with this shooting except for the fact that we saw all this
[41:18.840 --> 41:27.400]  pre-brainwashing and I was talking to Paul Watson this morning about all the
[41:27.400 --> 41:30.960]  pre-brainwashing and how the media is saying I live and truth is gonna kill
[41:30.960 --> 41:34.000]  they're gonna kill they're gonna start killing they're gonna kill look glen
[41:34.000 --> 41:37.560]  Beck mark my words they're gonna start killing and I'm like what an amazing
[41:37.560 --> 41:42.000]  statement we know these that these are government talking points and they want
[41:42.000 --> 41:45.520]  to get everybody afraid and say see I told you so when it happens and now
[41:45.520 --> 41:51.680]  suddenly these events are starting up and I said to Watson I said you've heard
[41:51.680 --> 41:55.960]  me the last few weeks saying I believe that the prime time for them to stage
[41:55.960 --> 42:04.680]  terror attacks is April 15th through April 19th because these people are
[42:04.680 --> 42:07.840]  pathological they tend to do things on the same day we know the feds bombed
[42:07.840 --> 42:12.800]  Oklahoma City on April 19th burned down Waco on April 19th and I said the
[42:12.800 --> 42:15.960]  Southern Parvy Law Center we know was running Elohim City where McVeigh was we
[42:15.960 --> 42:21.800]  have the federal affidavits from federal informants Carol Howell and from Terry
[42:21.800 --> 42:24.840]  Nichols that McVeigh was a government operative and being protected and was
[42:24.840 --> 42:27.840]  set up this has actually been in mainstream papers but never made it on
[42:27.840 --> 42:33.120]  nightly news big national news but it's been an AP it's been in the Salt Lake
[42:33.120 --> 42:41.680]  City paper it's been in the Daily Oklahoma and thanks to for your lawsuits by
[42:41.680 --> 42:48.000]  different activist groups and lawyers like Jesse Trenadu we've had on and I
[42:48.000 --> 42:52.680]  said if the Southern Parvy Law Center is on TV predicting that tea parties and
[42:52.680 --> 42:58.280]  barters and others are gonna carry out violence I said I really see them doing
[42:58.280 --> 43:02.880]  something you said well you didn't read my full article yesterday SPLC report
[43:02.880 --> 43:07.560]  heavy on smear thin on facts he said you didn't read their full report I said
[43:07.560 --> 43:10.000]  no I read your report I didn't read your full report he said we'll read it again
[43:10.000 --> 43:17.760]  they're predicting terror attacks in the middle to late April and they give the
[43:17.760 --> 43:24.040]  gun rights March in DC is an example of where that may happen and all they do is
[43:24.040 --> 43:26.640]  get a mentally ill person tell them they're gonna protect them or tell them
[43:26.640 --> 43:30.360]  it's part of a drill they march them out there or they set off a truck bomb or
[43:30.360 --> 43:34.600]  something God knows what they'll do it's just it's all coming to a head the
[43:34.600 --> 43:41.680]  entire globalist agenda is in trouble I mean Glenn Beck was saying birthers on
[43:41.680 --> 43:47.160]  his TV show first he demonizes truthers knowing a lot of conservatives don't
[43:47.160 --> 43:51.400]  like them thinking it's a Republican Democrat issue when it's not it's a
[43:51.400 --> 43:55.800]  truth issue and then he moves on to we don't know if this kamikaze guy was a
[43:55.800 --> 44:01.280]  birther or a truth or but we know or a constitutionalist oh see they're all bad
[44:01.280 --> 44:04.720]  now and then we get the Republican strategy internal memos that Politico
[44:04.720 --> 44:10.760]  reported on last Sunday where the Republican Party is targeting the true
[44:10.760 --> 44:15.480]  constitutionalist that started the Tea Party I don't need an internal report to
[44:15.480 --> 44:18.200]  tell me that they've been telling you that for months they're obviously coming
[44:18.200 --> 44:21.440]  out with talking points when you see every channel and every host saying the
[44:21.440 --> 44:26.880]  same thing well now we know it's a talking point and now Obama has launched
[44:26.880 --> 44:31.920]  the coffee party through his operatives and you see him promoting it on CNN
[44:31.920 --> 44:37.200]  everywhere else New York Times to counter the real coffee party that we've
[44:37.200 --> 44:41.000]  been developing to try to go in and really wake up the Tea Party before
[44:41.000 --> 44:47.280]  it's fully co-opted this is how the power structure works this is what they're
[44:47.280 --> 44:51.600]  paid to do is to balkanize us to keep us separate from each other to control
[44:51.600 --> 45:01.880]  us and we know let's look at one of the last terror attacks in the US and this
[45:01.880 --> 45:05.520]  came out the guy bragged about it on NPR we wrote a story about it back on
[45:05.520 --> 45:11.840]  December 8th of last year at info wars.com a federal informant who'd been
[45:11.840 --> 45:17.160]  sent to Venezuela to spy on people sent to New Orleans for Katrina a federal
[45:17.160 --> 45:24.840]  informant was then dispatched in 2006 to Austin and on record he hung out with
[45:24.840 --> 45:29.960]  the Palestinian professor who's cut his own throat slit his own guts bound
[45:29.960 --> 45:34.640]  himself his hands and feet with duct tape through himself in Lake Austin
[45:34.640 --> 45:41.280]  downtown I mean Houdini couldn't do that then his Imam called me we had him on
[45:41.280 --> 45:46.920]  they got the body back tortured to death just absolutely sliced up beat up
[45:46.920 --> 45:51.680]  bound Austin police are so incredibly corrupt folks I mean they could grab me
[45:51.680 --> 45:57.360]  slit my throat slit my guts open hog timey and throwing the lake and I mean
[45:57.360 --> 46:02.160]  that's like Fami Malik the Arkansas medical examiner that said that people
[46:02.160 --> 46:05.680]  could cut their own arms and legs off and be in plastic bags you can't cut
[46:05.680 --> 46:08.800]  your head and arms and legs off and put yourself in a plastic bag and then pour
[46:08.800 --> 46:13.360]  gasoline on yourself but he said so I mean that's the type of people we have
[46:13.360 --> 46:20.200]  that run Austin you want to have any idea about the higher ups and it turns
[46:20.200 --> 46:26.080]  out that guy was hanging out with him and he now is coming on the record people
[46:26.080 --> 46:28.720]  already said this about him and we've been warned about him but I couldn't go
[46:28.720 --> 46:32.560]  public as we couldn't prove it and he was going down to brave new books the
[46:32.560 --> 46:36.240]  Patriot hangout and everywhere else trying to get people on record to fire
[46:36.240 --> 46:40.920]  bomb that building then they could say oh look this Alex Jones connected group
[46:40.920 --> 46:45.440]  firebomb themselves and here's the weekly standard left-wing extremist plot
[46:45.440 --> 46:49.960]  to bomb RNC leads to copious national media coverage hand-wringing over
[46:49.960 --> 46:59.040]  dangers to Republic remember at the RNC in Minnesota and it's in the federal
[46:59.040 --> 47:02.120]  documents this guy over and over again pressured two young anarchists from
[47:02.120 --> 47:06.680]  Austin to firebomb to firebomb then they wouldn't do it he said okay I'm
[47:06.680 --> 47:13.240]  leaving and then he got them to show up where he was with the Moloff cocktails
[47:13.240 --> 47:20.280]  and that was enough now it was in the Denver Post that the police dressed up
[47:20.280 --> 47:23.360]  like anarchists and attacked other police in front of news cameras as the
[47:23.360 --> 47:27.040]  pretext to attack peaceful crowds and to demonize the First Amendment the same
[47:27.040 --> 47:32.120]  thing two years ago in in Ottawa Canada came out mainstream news Royal Mounted
[47:32.120 --> 47:39.360]  Police stage riot see once you know all this once you're living in this and
[47:39.360 --> 47:50.080]  seeing this you understand what you're facing and so every indicator is this
[47:50.080 --> 47:56.160]  was staged at the Pentagon yesterday and we know that the Pentagon protective
[47:56.160 --> 47:59.960]  services were intimately involved in running drills of the building being
[47:59.960 --> 48:03.320]  attacked in the year before the two months before and the day of the event
[48:03.320 --> 48:10.120]  they were running a drill this is ABC News and Associated Press of semi-fill
[48:10.120 --> 48:15.240]  martial law 9-1-1 martial law rise the police state or martial law 9-1 rise
[48:15.240 --> 48:18.280]  police state is the actual name long title just three hours long surely three
[48:18.280 --> 48:25.000]  films the Pentagon protective services were running a drill that day and of
[48:25.000 --> 48:28.600]  course that area of the building was empty and the list goes on and on and
[48:28.600 --> 48:34.080]  we've had eyewitnesses on this show who were in the Pentagon who talked about it
[48:34.080 --> 48:38.120]  was a small hole we have photos they could smell the cordyte it shot through
[48:38.120 --> 48:43.720]  all three rings and almost no wreckage no bodies no luggage no nothing and they
[48:43.720 --> 48:51.920]  seized all the video cameras that's how stupid they think you are and the CIA
[48:51.920 --> 48:56.600]  says in operation Northwoods we'll have a plane with certain tail numbers with
[48:56.600 --> 49:01.680]  CIA personnel undercover names will board it the aircraft will take off and
[49:01.680 --> 49:05.600]  land at a secure location we will then stage the death of all those people we
[49:05.600 --> 49:11.120]  know they're all gonna be given new identities and then we'll have another
[49:11.120 --> 49:16.520]  plane that takes up our remote control with the same tail numbers and we're
[49:16.520 --> 49:22.960]  gonna blow it up in the air and blame it on the Cubans I mean this is your
[49:22.960 --> 49:31.600]  government this is what is declassified army field manual declassified 2004
[49:31.600 --> 49:39.560]  teaches special ops captains in the army and above false flag you're in a
[49:39.560 --> 49:44.600]  village there's a nearby town that's getting political strength and
[49:44.600 --> 49:50.440]  organizing the people against the corrupt government that we control you
[49:50.440 --> 49:56.480]  kill some kids down by the water leave calling cards of the local leader that's
[49:56.480 --> 50:01.160]  how you false flag them and only real Americans fighting for America to see if
[50:01.160 --> 50:04.640]  we don't beat these people they're gonna take over and they're gonna create more
[50:04.640 --> 50:09.760]  havoc so it's a collateral damage in justifies the means so kill those kids
[50:09.760 --> 50:13.440]  that that'll that'll give us the upper hands we can bring democracy to this
[50:13.440 --> 50:18.400]  area yeah we got to kill a few innocent people but it's for the greater good man
[50:18.400 --> 50:22.120]  that's why we're shipping narcotics out of this country as well to ship it back
[50:22.120 --> 50:25.060]  to the US because we got to fund ourselves because the Communist and
[50:25.060 --> 50:33.320]  Congress won't give us the funding yes sir okay then ten years later you're
[50:33.320 --> 50:41.040]  wiring explosives in the World Trade Center but you're doing it for America
[50:41.040 --> 50:46.920]  aren't you doing it cuz you know America's just doesn't have what it takes
[50:46.920 --> 50:50.680]  anymore didn't unify enough so we got to have a Pearl Harbor event to get the
[50:50.680 --> 50:54.320]  people serious like Dick Cheney wrote the September 20th 2000 rebuilding

[01:02:54.160 --> 01:02:57.840]  russian communist paid homage friday to soviet leader joseph stalin while
[01:02:57.840 --> 01:03:07.000]  liberals accused the kremlin of convening to whitewash the dictator and it
[01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:11.640]  continues here now separately western media is criticizing russia which i
[01:03:11.640 --> 01:03:15.160]  think they should be criticized for this large sectors of the kremlin are
[01:03:15.160 --> 01:03:21.240]  talking good about communism and that's bad now meanwhile the communists
[01:03:21.240 --> 01:03:25.840]  conservatively killed 40 million people through linen and stalin 40 million
[01:03:25.840 --> 01:03:31.720]  mal killed 64 million according to the u.s. government encyclopedia britannica
[01:03:31.720 --> 01:03:38.880]  but the chinese government brags about it and says he killed over 80 million they
[01:03:38.880 --> 01:03:42.320]  say he was good his wife was bad they arrested mal's wife i mean did you know
[01:03:42.320 --> 01:03:46.800]  that it was kind of a revolution against him within china and things got a
[01:03:46.800 --> 01:03:50.800]  little better actually after that but the point is david Rockefeller got upset
[01:03:50.800 --> 01:03:56.400]  and wrote articles defending him in the new york times cnn comes out and says
[01:03:56.400 --> 01:04:05.560]  that mal was good and communism is good and good for women yeah good like a
[01:04:05.560 --> 01:04:10.200]  hole in the head so i thought i'd go over this and and and then asked the
[01:04:10.200 --> 01:04:14.720]  western media why are you criticizing russia for some of their kremlin being
[01:04:14.720 --> 01:04:20.640]  pro kami which you should it's bad it's dirty it's evil it's one of the top
[01:04:20.640 --> 01:04:26.000]  selling things in shirt shops is communist clothing i see yuppies running

[01:04:34.560 --> 01:04:39.800]  it's it's it's offensive to me but meanwhile the guardian is saying north

[01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:47.920]  to defectors in south korea so they executed the guy and they're saying
[01:04:47.920 --> 01:04:51.880]  that's bad well it is bad but but that's the kind of stuff mal did so you
[01:04:51.880 --> 01:04:57.520]  can't have it both ways mal is good but north korea and russia are bad russia

[01:08:02.800 --> 01:08:07.480]  Zhang Zhou Li is the president of the all-China women's Federation one of the
[01:08:07.480 --> 01:08:11.640]  top-ranking women in the Chinese government and witness to the major
[01:08:11.640 --> 01:08:17.800]  changes in women's status since the communist revolution among the first
[01:08:17.800 --> 01:08:21.680]  laws passed by Chairman Mao's government were statutes banning foot
[01:08:21.680 --> 01:08:27.600]  binding bride-selling dowry polygamy and concubines women were invited to leave
[01:08:27.600 --> 01:08:34.080]  the home and join a labor force Mao spoke those famous words women hold up
[01:08:34.080 --> 01:08:40.440]  half the sky if the statistics are any indication communism has been good for
[01:08:40.440 --> 01:08:42.720]  women
[01:08:46.280 --> 01:08:51.720]  constantly at colleges and at government buildings of Canada England the US
[01:08:51.720 --> 01:08:57.680]  they're putting up Mao statues that's been in the news at city halls there
[01:08:57.680 --> 01:09:03.960]  they're saying how great he is I've seen three different Obama's Zars say Mao is
[01:09:03.960 --> 01:09:09.520]  good Hugo Chavez is good because he's censoring the media and that we need to
[01:09:09.520 --> 01:09:15.680]  censor our media China has forced abortion with women women are uses
[01:09:15.680 --> 01:09:19.760]  slaves in the factories and it was declassified of course at the CIA
[01:09:19.760 --> 01:09:24.080]  finance the women's movement here in the United States it sounded good on the
[01:09:24.080 --> 01:09:28.280]  surface so they could break up the family so women wouldn't be at home so they
[01:09:28.280 --> 01:09:32.120]  could literally get everybody paying taxes and have the state start raising
[01:09:32.120 --> 01:09:35.720]  people's children the same globalist model that the West funded in
[01:09:35.720 --> 01:09:39.800]  communist China is now being implemented here in three months ago at Copenhagen
[01:09:39.800 --> 01:09:44.720]  they called for a global one-child policy modeled after China and admitted
[01:09:44.720 --> 01:09:50.280]  that China is the UN model the US and the top globalist in the mid 70s made
[01:09:50.280 --> 01:09:54.160]  deals with China and move all our technologies over there because they
[01:09:54.160 --> 01:09:57.680]  would adopt the globalist program then China would be built up into an
[01:09:57.680 --> 01:10:03.920]  industrial colossus to destroy all competition because no one can compete
[01:10:03.920 --> 01:10:09.080]  with a billion 500 million slaves and that's what they're just about a billion
[01:10:09.080 --> 01:10:16.120]  500 million India over a billion it is just incredible what's going on and to
[01:10:16.120 --> 01:10:23.240]  have the media praising a mass murderer is unprecedented now Wayne Paul is a
[01:10:23.240 --> 01:10:29.840]  CPA brother of Congressman Ron Paul he is a in the Fed activist a patriot of many
[01:10:29.840 --> 01:10:34.360]  decades exposing the IRS that is a collection agency for the fellow reserve
[01:10:34.360 --> 01:10:40.080]  and he joins us for the next 50 minutes here today will also open the phones up
[01:10:40.080 --> 01:10:44.000]  and cover other news and get Wayne Paul's take on what's going on but Wayne
[01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:49.600]  did you ever think you'd see CNN praising the greatest mass murderer in
[01:10:49.600 --> 01:10:57.680]  world history never in my life but what I have thought that Wayne so much has
[01:10:57.680 --> 01:11:06.000]  happened in in your you know decades of fighting the New World Order break down
[01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:15.120]  for people your worldview your family's worldview and and basically define the
[01:11:15.120 --> 01:11:20.360]  New World Order and we've come to that critical juncture now where the big
[01:11:20.360 --> 01:11:25.000]  private central banks are openly bankrupting the planet openly announcing
[01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:33.240]  world government yeah and I think we all have to sit back and and take a look
[01:11:33.240 --> 01:11:41.120]  at what's going on recognizing the fact that ten years ago had Alex Jones had
[01:11:41.120 --> 01:11:47.200]  such a an idea on a radio station he probably couldn't get enough sponsors
[01:11:47.200 --> 01:11:53.240]  that do we have them on yet today it makes sense with the understanding of our
[01:11:53.240 --> 01:12:00.560]  economic condition and the control of all the major banking cartels throughout
[01:12:00.560 --> 01:12:07.520]  the world that controls everything we do it's it's interesting to me that today
[01:12:07.520 --> 01:12:15.440]  educationally we as the people are much wiser today about the concept of a New
[01:12:15.440 --> 01:12:20.800]  World Order and what they're doing to our individual liberties and freedom that
[01:12:20.800 --> 01:12:27.720]  I think it's a fantastic time to be living just to see the changes in the
[01:12:27.720 --> 01:12:32.720]  understanding that the people have that they didn't have ten years ago Wayne
[01:12:32.720 --> 01:12:36.640]  Paul you're in the Obama deception I interviewed you up in an in the Fed
[01:12:36.640 --> 01:12:39.760]  rally that it later came out the army was watching because we're such evil
[01:12:39.760 --> 01:12:44.880]  Americans that want to get these foreign banks off our backs and and you talked
[01:12:44.880 --> 01:12:50.160]  about how the bankers took over the war powers act what social security really
[01:12:50.160 --> 01:12:54.600]  is how the bankers are able to violate the Constitution and Bill of Rights
[01:12:54.600 --> 01:13:01.080]  break it down in more detail here on the air today exactly what we're facing and
[01:13:01.080 --> 01:13:07.520]  how our form of government our Republic really got overthrown back in 1933 well
[01:13:07.520 --> 01:13:15.320]  it really goes back through the 1933 it goes back to 1913 when the Federal
[01:13:15.320 --> 01:13:24.160]  Reserve Act was first passed when that happened the Congress in effect gave up
[01:13:24.160 --> 01:13:30.600]  our liberties as it relates to our rights to banking and our rights to
[01:13:30.600 --> 01:13:39.840]  exchange property for services and it took only 20 years from 1913 to 1933
[01:13:39.840 --> 01:13:47.760]  before our federal government was bankrupt they spent more money and borrowed
[01:13:47.760 --> 01:13:52.560]  more money from the Federal Reserve in the first 20 years of their reserves
[01:13:52.560 --> 01:14:01.840]  existed that in 1933 Roosevelt declared the United States was bankrupt so since
[01:14:01.840 --> 01:14:08.080]  that time it's the Federal Reserve banking cartel that has manipulated or
[01:14:08.080 --> 01:14:17.040]  controlled whatever they saw fit for our economy in our life and it it's taken
[01:14:17.040 --> 01:14:24.640]  from 1933 to present or those of us who have been studying and researching this
[01:14:24.640 --> 01:14:31.160]  come to understand and are able to teach it to other people so we now have to
[01:14:31.160 --> 01:14:37.080]  start that change now one of the changes that's going on dramatically right now
[01:14:37.080 --> 01:14:44.880]  are the various states that are passing state laws as it relates to banking as
[01:14:44.880 --> 01:14:52.320]  it relates to gun control as it relates to carrying firearms and they're saying
[01:14:52.320 --> 01:14:57.440]  to the federal government constitutionally you can't come into this
[01:14:57.440 --> 01:15:02.400]  state and tell us whether we can have a gun or not and you can't come into this
[01:15:02.400 --> 01:15:08.720]  state and tell us that if we bank within the state we don't have to be under the
[01:15:08.720 --> 01:15:14.760]  federal regulation all these are things are exciting in terms of the changes
[01:15:14.760 --> 01:15:20.280]  that are taking place today well expanding on that you're absolutely
[01:15:20.280 --> 01:15:25.320]  right but 1933 was when they were able to bankrupt us and bring us into
[01:15:25.320 --> 01:15:30.720]  emergency rule 1913 was when they got their beachhead and then just a few
[01:15:30.720 --> 01:15:35.240]  years later they were able to bring us into receivership then they issued the
[01:15:35.240 --> 01:15:41.880]  social security card that was literally the debt servant system and that's when
[01:15:41.880 --> 01:15:47.280]  they began making us their dependence and expanding it and so we've been under
[01:15:47.280 --> 01:15:54.080]  their system since 33 completely under their thumb since 33 and all we've seen
[01:15:54.080 --> 01:15:58.160]  since then is a progression of social engineering booms and busts as the
[01:15:58.160 --> 01:16:02.360]  banks mass more and more power and now they brag that they've gotten more power
[01:16:02.360 --> 01:16:06.640]  out of the banker bailout they're establishing a bank of the world a
[01:16:06.640 --> 01:16:11.440]  global constitution will pay our carbon taxes to the bankers they admit this is
[01:16:11.440 --> 01:16:15.280]  meant to shut down competition vertically consolidate and integrate the
[01:16:15.280 --> 01:16:21.640]  economy into a worldwide monopoly controlled by this by this cartel and
[01:16:21.640 --> 01:16:25.640]  you're right the states are waking up the people are waking up we've never
[01:16:25.640 --> 01:16:29.600]  seen such an awakening it's past the house your brother's bill congressman
[01:16:29.600 --> 01:16:34.560]  Ron Paul who joined us yesterday to audit the private fellow reserve but I
[01:16:34.560 --> 01:16:37.360]  believe they're going to strike back and I believe they're going to do that Wayne
[01:16:37.360 --> 01:16:43.920]  through staging crises and staging wars and staging terror attacks to be
[01:16:43.920 --> 01:16:49.280]  blamed on the tea parties and the in the Fed groups what's your take on that
[01:16:49.280 --> 01:16:55.400]  well it's kind of interesting that you bring that up because if you look at our
[01:16:55.400 --> 01:17:03.160]  gubernatorial ways here in Texas alone and when the minority
[01:17:03.160 --> 01:17:13.280]  thought Texan was running against the two incumbents she was put on a show and
[01:17:13.280 --> 01:17:20.080]  the first thing the guy said is are you a believer he are you a truth or as real
[01:17:20.080 --> 01:17:25.360]  age to 9-11 unfortunately they didn't have anything to do with the race in
[01:17:25.360 --> 01:17:33.440]  Texas but it was used to make her look bad but the truth be known that whether
[01:17:33.440 --> 01:17:45.840]  it's 9-11 whether it's the the the killing that took place in Waco Ruby
[01:17:45.840 --> 01:17:55.520]  Red all of these are suspect as a basis to eliminate a little more of our
[01:17:55.520 --> 01:18:03.080]  freedom you know now you almost have to go through a complete body cavity
[01:18:03.080 --> 01:18:10.800]  search to get on an airplane and that's pretty demeaning in my opinion and it's
[01:18:10.800 --> 01:18:21.200]  pretty taking away a lot of my privacy and as a person handicapped that has a
[01:18:21.200 --> 01:18:28.680]  hard time standing going through a security line and having to stand there
[01:18:28.680 --> 01:18:36.400]  not being able to touch anything is really demeaning to me did you see the
[01:18:36.400 --> 01:18:41.680]  report of the boy that couldn't even walk he was four he was in leg braces he
[01:18:41.680 --> 01:18:45.120]  couldn't walk more than just a few feet they had just gotten him in that last
[01:18:45.120 --> 01:18:48.400]  month able to walk a few feet in a wheelchair they made him get out of the
[01:18:48.400 --> 01:18:54.040]  wheelchair without his parents help and go through the metal detector while he
[01:18:54.040 --> 01:18:58.720]  was crying it's it's all an act of submission recording our naked body
[01:18:58.720 --> 01:19:04.520]  because somebody might do something we're all guilty now that that's correct
[01:19:04.520 --> 01:19:11.360]  and I think we're gonna see more and more of that kind of thing as quote a
[01:19:11.360 --> 01:19:21.760]  deterrent to to terrorism and it's only going to take more and more of the
[01:19:21.760 --> 01:19:29.560]  freedom from us and they're doing that and they're also doing that in terms of
[01:19:29.560 --> 01:19:34.560]  taking our financial freedoms away from us yeah let's talk about that because
[01:19:34.560 --> 01:19:38.640]  they're raising taxes on every level police have been caught with quotas
[01:19:38.640 --> 01:19:43.840]  that are illegal all over the country and they're just building up this police
[01:19:43.840 --> 01:19:48.120]  state to forcibly extract this from us and I agree with you regardless of
[01:19:48.120 --> 01:19:53.640]  whether terror in each case is real or staged or not it's being focused on the
[01:19:53.640 --> 01:19:58.280]  average free person as a pretext to take our rights as the homeland security
[01:19:58.280 --> 01:20:02.600]  documents showed last year Wayne Paul stay with us we all know that the

[01:24:31.320 --> 01:24:35.520]  here they are from last night September 11th conspiracy theorist opens fire at
[01:24:35.520 --> 01:24:41.040]  Pentagon why are they so scared of people that talk about staged events but
[01:24:41.040 --> 01:24:45.080]  we're getting into that in the next hour after Wayne Paul leaves us Wayne is a
[01:24:45.080 --> 01:24:50.920]  CPA he's been battling the IRS exposing their activities for years whether you
[01:24:50.920 --> 01:24:54.600]  think the income tax is constitutional or not what we know is it
[01:24:54.600 --> 01:24:59.160]  constitutional is their treatment of people no due process their own special
[01:24:59.160 --> 01:25:04.040]  courts seizing things just because they feel like it just like the family court
[01:25:04.040 --> 01:25:08.680]  we know they violate the Constitution and Bella writes every day we know they
[01:25:08.680 --> 01:25:13.040]  drive people into suicide into desperation most people that own
[01:25:13.040 --> 01:25:18.360]  businesses can't pay all these taxes or they go under Wayne Paul you've been
[01:25:18.360 --> 01:25:22.520]  battling these guys for years you were talking about financial tyranny as we
[01:25:22.520 --> 01:25:27.040]  went to break talk about that now well one of the quick things I would like to
[01:25:27.040 --> 01:25:33.680]  point out is that last year the government in their infinite wisdom
[01:25:33.680 --> 01:25:41.080]  decrease the withholding tax tables that employers had withhold money from the
[01:25:41.080 --> 01:25:45.720]  employees to send to the government and they said here we're gonna give you a
[01:25:45.720 --> 01:25:53.520]  break the problem with that is they never change the tax rate for the year as
[01:25:53.520 --> 01:25:59.960]  it relates to the tax return so now we're filing tax returns for the year
[01:25:59.960 --> 01:26:09.400]  2009 and guess what many many more people owe taxes this year we're in
[01:26:09.400 --> 01:26:15.200]  far years they either broke even or got a few dollars back so they deceived the
[01:26:15.200 --> 01:26:20.200]  people in during the year saying they were going to give them a benefit but
[01:26:20.200 --> 01:26:25.560]  oh they forgot to change the tax rate tables and guess what we have to pay
[01:26:25.560 --> 01:26:31.200]  for it now so is it true that they're gonna charge is it true they're gonna
[01:26:31.200 --> 01:26:35.680]  try to charge penalties and interest if people don't have the money oh absolutely
[01:26:35.680 --> 01:26:43.640]  after April 15 penalty and interest accrues and most people who work at
[01:26:43.640 --> 01:26:49.440]  McDonald's are in an auto repair shop or you know for minimum or medium wage
[01:26:49.440 --> 01:26:53.600]  they don't even understand the system it's just taken out so a year or two
[01:26:53.600 --> 01:26:58.040]  from now they're gonna get hit with a big tax bill with masses of interest
[01:26:58.040 --> 01:27:02.920]  saying you didn't pay your tax and that's absolutely the case and that's
[01:27:02.920 --> 01:27:11.240]  probably the most frustrating part of my work is try to negate or eliminate
[01:27:11.240 --> 01:27:19.160]  penalties and interest on taxes because of errors the IRS made as well as errors
[01:27:19.160 --> 01:27:24.800]  that the taxpayer makes they're very they're not very willing to ever amend
[01:27:24.800 --> 01:27:33.760]  or adjust penalties and interest and the IRS makes a lot of mistakes don't they
[01:27:33.760 --> 01:27:45.440]  well there was GAO on it about 15 years ago where the GAO put 10 people in a
[01:27:45.440 --> 01:27:53.720]  room gave them all the same tax information and lo and behold when the
[01:27:53.720 --> 01:28:03.960]  10 returns were submitted there were 10 different answers so who's right and now
[01:28:03.960 --> 01:28:07.760]  what we found is they've changed the laws the last three years for CPAs you can
[01:28:07.760 --> 01:28:14.040]  tell us about that putting burden on you and so CPAs I've now found that I keep
[01:28:14.040 --> 01:28:18.560]  hiring are trying to make me pay more than I even owe under the fraudulent
[01:28:18.560 --> 01:28:22.840]  system because they're scared so they just say give me your money to them get
[01:28:22.840 --> 01:28:30.640]  every all your money everything must go yeah what happens is I'm I am now being
[01:28:30.640 --> 01:28:39.960]  audited under my tax preparer ID number to see my consistency or how I prepare
[01:28:39.960 --> 01:28:47.160]  returns and if they find something that they believe would be inconsistent to
[01:28:47.160 --> 01:28:54.600]  the code then they can then come and just attack me as a preparer because I
[01:28:54.600 --> 01:29:02.360]  consistently do something that they consider is not correct so they ought
[01:29:02.360 --> 01:29:10.000]  to prepare as much now as they audit the taxpayer well let's come back and get
[01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:14.480]  into more of the IRS abuse that you've seen because from all the reports I've
[01:29:14.480 --> 01:29:18.000]  seen they don't even follow due process nothing they just grab bank accounts do
[01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:27.480]  whatever they want well unfortunately that's the case and it's difficult to
[01:29:27.480 --> 01:29:37.760]  properly answer every IRS notice the majority DAO stated about six or eight
[01:29:37.760 --> 01:29:45.800]  years ago that probably 80% of IRS notices that are sent to people are
[01:29:45.800 --> 01:29:52.240]  incorrect notice absolutely 80% but they don't care stay there we're on the
[01:29:52.240 --> 01:30:03.320]  March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network hi folks this
[01:30:03.320 --> 01:30:06.800]  is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the silver lungs generator now

[01:30:19.040 --> 01:30:23.760]  viruses the silver lungs generator infuses the respiratory system with
[01:30:23.760 --> 01:30:28.760]  yourself produced nano silver solutions and also delivers the silver nano
[01:30:28.760 --> 01:30:33.120]  particles instantly into the bloodstream with continued legislation
[01:30:33.120 --> 01:30:37.360]  threatening the sale of nano silver products you can now produce pure and
[01:30:37.360 --> 01:30:42.240]  endless colloidal silver with the silver lungs generator very easy to follow

[01:31:03.680 --> 01:31:08.000]  solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily double
[01:31:08.000 --> 01:31:12.200]  or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control
[01:31:12.200 --> 01:31:16.240]  how much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total
[01:31:16.240 --> 01:31:20.120]  government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is
[01:31:20.120 --> 01:31:24.280]  coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously
[01:31:24.280 --> 01:31:28.560]  overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the
[01:31:28.560 --> 01:31:32.920]  problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every
[01:31:32.920 --> 01:31:36.600]  year thousands of families lose their power from weather-related onages number
[01:31:36.600 --> 01:31:40.800]  five a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of
[01:31:40.800 --> 01:31:44.200]  mind folks I really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions

[01:33:17.480 --> 01:33:22.560]  trends forecaster Wayne Paul CPA patriot in the fatter brother of
[01:33:22.560 --> 01:33:25.960]  Congressman Ron Paul is our guest we're gonna go back to him in a moment start
[01:33:25.960 --> 01:33:30.520]  taking your phone calls I wanted to first though thank one of our sponsors a
[01:33:30.520 --> 01:33:34.840]  cola blue the atmospheric water generator system they have little units that
[01:33:34.840 --> 01:33:37.640]  do seven and a half gallons a day that look like a water cooler without the
[01:33:37.640 --> 01:33:41.000]  water bottle on top grabs water out of the air puts it through a bunch of great
[01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:46.240]  filters very inexpensive works very very well a lot cheaper than bottle water
[01:33:46.240 --> 01:33:49.480]  that you can't guarantee is safe there's no fluoride in this ladies and

[01:34:14.440 --> 01:34:19.280]  and remember you may know all about the New World Order it's about waking
[01:34:19.280 --> 01:34:23.320]  somebody up every week and our numbers have exponentially been growing we'll
[01:34:23.320 --> 01:34:27.680]  talk about that more with Wayne Paul here in a moment but going back to Wayne I
[01:34:27.680 --> 01:34:32.280]  mean the outrageous you know the news reports of the IRS showing up at a house
[01:34:32.280 --> 01:34:37.440]  seizing it seizing the furniture seizing family photos grabbing wedding rings
[01:34:37.440 --> 01:34:42.840]  off women's fingers people committing suicide and it's done outside due process
[01:34:42.840 --> 01:34:47.120]  and it turns out Wrangles not paying taxes Geithner the head of the IRS isn't
[01:34:47.120 --> 01:34:51.720]  paying taxes Wrangles was the head of the tax committee it turns out close to
[01:34:51.720 --> 01:34:56.600]  half of Congress doesn't pay all their taxes or doesn't pay at all the EU
[01:34:56.600 --> 01:35:00.840]  bureaucrats wrote the laws where they pay a 17% income tax and the average
[01:35:00.840 --> 01:35:05.280]  Europeans over 50% I mean this is just so incredibly corrupt and when your
[01:35:05.280 --> 01:35:09.640]  brothers always on TV Ron Paul they'll say you want to get rid of the income
[01:35:09.640 --> 01:35:13.480]  tax sir how will we fund America and a lot of times he's at the Capitol he
[01:35:13.480 --> 01:35:17.680]  goes the Capitol behind me was built a hundred and something years before we
[01:35:17.680 --> 01:35:23.880]  even had the income tax so you know this country had a 10% growth rate yearly on
[01:35:23.880 --> 01:35:29.000]  average zero inflation until we got the income tax which is Ronald Reagan's own
[01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:33.240]  congressional commission found in 81 not one red cent of your income tax goes
[01:35:33.240 --> 01:35:37.360]  around the country it all goes to the bankers who now are fully bankrupting us
[01:35:37.360 --> 01:35:46.040]  by design that's absolutely correct and I think the important issue on the
[01:35:46.040 --> 01:35:55.640]  Gestapo tactics of the IRS should people should understand that they are the
[01:35:55.640 --> 01:36:03.720]  collector of the debt that our government owes the banking system and because of
[01:36:03.720 --> 01:36:09.440]  that they don't they feel they don't have to follow the law in fact that's
[01:36:09.440 --> 01:36:16.600]  what got me involved in IRS litigation some 35 years ago because the first kind
[01:36:16.600 --> 01:36:22.760]  of walk to my office after he told me his story he had a disability
[01:36:22.760 --> 01:36:28.840]  retirement and within five weeks after he came to my office he had gone back to
[01:36:28.840 --> 01:36:35.680]  drinking and he died of sclerosis of the liver and I look at that compared to the
[01:36:35.680 --> 01:36:42.320]  guy two weeks ago that flew his airplane into the IRS building why is not
[01:36:42.320 --> 01:36:53.360]  Congress looking at why this guy did it what what forces and me and a human
[01:36:53.360 --> 01:37:01.160]  being to such extremes that he says I gotta put a story out there I gotta
[01:37:01.160 --> 01:37:08.600]  kill myself if you know Congress ought to be sitting and bouncing up and down on
[01:37:08.600 --> 01:37:12.520]  the IRS and say no wait a minute what are you guys doing that's causing
[01:37:12.520 --> 01:37:20.600]  somebody to get so frustrated and so desperate that it turn around and flies
[01:37:20.600 --> 01:37:28.440]  their plane into a building well our country revolted over taxes a lot
[01:37:28.440 --> 01:37:33.080]  lower than what they are right now and the people were happy to pay taxes but
[01:37:33.080 --> 01:37:37.880]  they said no taxes without representation and also the taxes weren't
[01:37:37.880 --> 01:37:42.120]  being equally applied that's what really started the Civil War as you know in the
[01:37:42.120 --> 01:37:49.200]  1860s but I have stacks of news every day where they're increasing the tickets
[01:37:49.200 --> 01:37:55.400]  the fines the fees the regulations taxes on food taxes on the environment a 2.6
[01:37:55.400 --> 01:37:59.480]  billion tax they're trying to pass in Austin in the first three years 2.6
[01:37:59.480 --> 01:38:04.200]  billion that's more than all taxes in Austin in three years combined I mean
[01:38:04.200 --> 01:38:10.160]  it's just a cancer and the the only sector hiring is government that's
[01:38:10.160 --> 01:38:15.160]  admitted all the other industries are literally shutting down and it's like an
[01:38:15.160 --> 01:38:20.040]  orgy of criminality of the parasite class where do you see this going Wayne well
[01:38:20.040 --> 01:38:30.960]  I think by education by learning and by people becoming more knowledgeable about
[01:38:30.960 --> 01:38:39.040]  the way the system works we will eventually see the the rights of the
[01:38:39.040 --> 01:38:47.840]  people they will come back and through elections and we've had one just Tuesday
[01:38:47.840 --> 01:38:53.680]  in Texas that even though it was disappointing in some races it was
[01:38:53.680 --> 01:39:03.520]  encouraging and others because there are fundamental constitutional people that
[01:39:03.520 --> 01:39:10.440]  won elections this time around in Texas and therefore I don't think Governor
[01:39:10.440 --> 01:39:16.240]  Perry is going to be able to be as dogmatic enforceable on his liberal
[01:39:16.240 --> 01:39:22.440]  ideas is how he wants to run Texas you know he doesn't do anything for
[01:39:22.440 --> 01:39:27.200]  protecting the border he confiscates our property when it comes to the
[01:39:27.200 --> 01:39:33.440]  trans taxes quarter and he's trying he tried it one time to force our children
[01:39:33.440 --> 01:39:40.400]  to turn around and get shot all those things are going to change and I'll
[01:39:40.400 --> 01:39:45.920]  change it one person at a time and that will start to make differences and
[01:39:45.920 --> 01:39:50.880]  we're going to see changes take place absolutely Wayne Paul we're going to
[01:39:50.880 --> 01:39:55.360]  some of your calls here in a moment but I've got a big stack of this news we're

[01:39:57.800 --> 01:40:02.000]  break down the obvious staged event at the Pentagon and how they're coming after
[01:40:02.000 --> 01:40:08.880]  anyone that questions 9-11 I mean this is serious serious what's coming up so
[01:40:08.880 --> 01:40:14.520]  people need to definitely stay with us but the Wall Street Journal reports the
[01:40:14.520 --> 01:40:20.400]  end of the internet as we know it wired magazine says cybersecurity the end of
[01:40:20.400 --> 01:40:24.680]  the open free internet that's the headline so finally the media is paying
[01:40:24.680 --> 01:40:29.000]  attention to what we've broken down the last two months it's now past the house
[01:40:29.000 --> 01:40:32.520]  is in the Senate of what's in the cyber security bill people are finally
[01:40:32.520 --> 01:40:36.280]  reading the cyber security bill so good job to the audience getting this out to
[01:40:36.280 --> 01:40:41.520]  the media that we've requested you to do it's finally all over the news here's
[01:40:41.520 --> 01:40:45.080]  the drudge report linking to mainstream news big sis unleashed homeland
[01:40:45.080 --> 01:40:49.360]  security program digs into all internet communications tracking everything no

[01:40:59.400 --> 01:41:04.040]  this just went up Steve Watson it's also on prisonplanet.com former director of
[01:41:04.040 --> 01:41:07.200]  national intelligence calls for re-engineering the internet the world
[01:41:07.200 --> 01:41:12.040]  is one major cyber event away from total restriction of the web they are now
[01:41:12.040 --> 01:41:16.280]  openly coming out saying they want to end free speech on the web Wayne because
[01:41:16.280 --> 01:41:20.080]  they know we're winning the battle for hearts and minds we're waking the
[01:41:20.080 --> 01:41:24.440]  people up are you concerned about their open announcements that they want to
[01:41:24.440 --> 01:41:32.080]  censor the internet absolutely because that our basic freedom in liberty is to
[01:41:32.080 --> 01:41:38.120]  be able to speak those ideas and voice our opinions opinions are always great
[01:41:38.120 --> 01:41:43.560]  I you know I don't have to agree with you to listen to you but I also have to
[01:41:43.560 --> 01:41:48.920]  grant you the right to give me your opinion and your thoughts I think that
[01:41:48.920 --> 01:42:00.120]  is a basic constitutional right that we have and any attempt to stop that over
[01:42:00.120 --> 01:42:06.600]  the internet should absolutely be 600% opposed by every human being that
[01:42:06.600 --> 01:42:13.320]  wants to face the earth today absolutely I'm digging around here in my stack for
[01:42:13.320 --> 01:42:18.840]  that Wall Street Journal headline I've also got wired magazine admitting that
[01:42:18.840 --> 01:42:24.080]  total censorship of the web now being set up where the Pentagon will run every
[01:42:24.080 --> 01:42:28.560]  internet distribution system openly talking about censorship I mean these
[01:42:28.560 --> 01:42:33.320]  are very very desperate times Wayne I want to go to calls and go into the
[01:42:33.320 --> 01:42:36.920]  different issues that they're gonna raise but while we've got you here today
[01:42:36.920 --> 01:42:42.040]  talking about your brother Congressman Ron Paul watching him in and out of
[01:42:42.040 --> 01:42:46.680]  Congress in the last 30 years first went there in the 80s for a short stint
[01:42:46.680 --> 01:42:52.240]  and came back in the 90s going from no one co-sponsoring his bills to his
[01:42:52.240 --> 01:42:56.640]  bills now passing the house we've gone from maybe 1% of Americans going to
[01:42:56.640 --> 01:43:00.560]  Federal Reserve is private to some polls over 90% wanting to audit it or
[01:43:00.560 --> 01:43:05.280]  abolish it it's exponentially growing to see him get an 84% approval rating in
[01:43:05.280 --> 01:43:10.720]  Texas 80 plus percent of the vote in the Republican primary to see
[01:43:10.720 --> 01:43:18.360]  constitutionalist molded in your brother's stead you know mimicking what
[01:43:18.360 --> 01:43:23.800]  he's done as a prototype running at the state level everywhere I mean this has
[01:43:23.800 --> 01:43:31.960]  gotta be really exciting for you I think it is one of the most amazing things as
[01:43:31.960 --> 01:43:42.120]  you know I have four older brothers Ron being one of them and it's amazing to me
[01:43:42.120 --> 01:43:50.400]  I've been the closest to Ron in terms of philosophy understanding and learning as
[01:43:50.400 --> 01:43:59.480]  relates to privacy as relates to liberty but it was fascinating to see the
[01:43:59.480 --> 01:44:06.520]  other three brothers listen to him and slowly absorb what he was saying so even
[01:44:06.520 --> 01:44:13.680]  they have turned around and learned a lot over the last two years in terms of
[01:44:13.680 --> 01:44:20.400]  what Ron's been able to do and he he absolutely is a beacon of a shining light
[01:44:20.400 --> 01:44:27.960]  out there for other people to look at follow learn and understand from and
[01:44:27.960 --> 01:44:34.880]  when he started 35 years ago he said I'm just I want to do this for
[01:44:34.880 --> 01:44:40.760]  educational purposes I don't think I'll ever make a difference but if I can get
[01:44:40.760 --> 01:44:45.480]  one more people to understand or one more person to understand what I
[01:44:45.480 --> 01:44:52.680]  understand this country will be better off and I think that's happening today
[01:44:52.680 --> 01:44:57.040]  well it's another testament to what one person taking action and joining with
[01:44:57.040 --> 01:45:02.240]  others can do we have to the long view of history and take our country county
[01:45:02.240 --> 01:45:08.000]  state federal back and put out the truth versus the controlled corporate system
[01:45:08.000 --> 01:45:12.840]  and big government systems lies and in the end their tyranny will not stand no
[01:45:12.840 --> 01:45:16.800]  matter how many police how many black helicopters how many cameras how many
[01:45:16.800 --> 01:45:21.880]  spies how much surveillance false flag terror none of it is going to hold this
[01:45:21.880 --> 01:45:28.080]  together and we could see the momentum shifting against them right now but
[01:45:28.080 --> 01:45:33.040]  looking at what your brother's been able to do what you've been able to do but I
[01:45:33.040 --> 01:45:37.960]  just wonder because I'm 36 years old and I get exhausted doing four hours a day
[01:45:37.960 --> 01:45:43.440]  working on films reading legislation doing other interviews and I say no to
[01:45:43.440 --> 01:45:48.440]  most interviews now I don't know how your brother at what 74 years old that's
[01:45:48.440 --> 01:45:54.080]  right how he because I happen to know a lot about his schedule I mean the guy
[01:45:54.080 --> 01:46:02.520]  is working 1415 16 hours a day and I've never seen anyone as dynamic as your
[01:46:02.520 --> 01:46:10.880]  brother and I just he is absolutely possessed with liberty in a in a Thomas
[01:46:10.880 --> 01:46:18.600]  Jefferson type way you know burning in the minds of men just briefly what makes
[01:46:18.600 --> 01:46:27.320]  your brother tick well I think he's excited about the prospects of liberty
[01:46:27.320 --> 01:46:34.840]  he's excited about the young people learning about liberty and he just
[01:46:34.840 --> 01:46:43.040]  feels that that's where our future lies and I give the example of a local family
[01:46:43.040 --> 01:46:49.480]  here that I know personally whose son graduated from high school this year and
[01:46:49.480 --> 01:46:59.320]  he's 17 years old and his thesis paper for his senior year was written on the
[01:46:59.320 --> 01:47:08.200]  Federal Reserve he then had to give a talk in front of he had to defend his
[01:47:08.200 --> 01:47:17.040]  thesis in front of the parents and the and in front of his classmates as to
[01:47:17.040 --> 01:47:23.760]  why he felt as he did now when I was a senior in high school I wouldn't have
[01:47:23.760 --> 01:47:28.760]  had a clue as to what to talk about but here's a 17-year-old that's read more
[01:47:28.760 --> 01:47:33.840]  books in every book that runs ever printed and there's millions and there's
[01:47:33.840 --> 01:47:37.640]  millions in high school learning about the New World Order and learning about
[01:47:37.640 --> 01:47:40.480]  liberty and freedom that's why the globalists are so scared
[01:47:40.480 --> 01:47:45.240]  absolutely in fact I talked to Daniel Estolin who really does have sources in
[01:47:45.240 --> 01:47:51.240]  Bilderberg I even know their names off record and he said in 2006 they were
[01:47:51.240 --> 01:47:57.000]  deathly afraid of Ron Paul then again in 2008 and they and they said we may
[01:47:57.000 --> 01:48:00.120]  have to take him out and I brought this up to your brother and he knows this is
[01:48:00.120 --> 01:48:04.160]  a reality not because he had a chance to win the presidency at least at that
[01:48:04.160 --> 01:48:10.400]  time frame but because the hottest thing on campuses is anti-New World Order in
[01:48:10.400 --> 01:48:16.200]  the Fed displacing the phony right-wing and phony left-wing paradigm and that
[01:48:16.200 --> 01:48:22.280]  they are scared to death absolutely there's no doubt about it and if so if
[01:48:22.280 --> 01:48:29.120]  you take a look we just had an election in the state representative race in the
[01:48:29.120 --> 01:48:38.280]  seventh district a gentleman by the name of David Simpson beat in a primary a an
[01:48:38.280 --> 01:48:45.240]  incumbent of seven terms who in my opinion is a typical rhino and he got
[01:48:45.240 --> 01:48:51.000]  defeated and I think that's totally encouraging and it's something that I
[01:48:51.000 --> 01:48:57.320]  think is fantastic for everybody to see and witness the changes that are taking
[01:48:57.320 --> 01:49:02.600]  place let me throw this out there and we're going to calls in internal
[01:49:02.600 --> 01:49:06.760]  White House memos cast Sunstein memos White House regulations are in
[01:49:06.760 --> 01:49:12.200]  congressional hearings and internal Bilderberg group meanings their number
[01:49:12.200 --> 01:49:18.360]  one thing they talk about is us patriots and our ideas spreading worldwide we are
[01:49:18.360 --> 01:49:23.800]  the only thing standing between the globalist and world domination and the
[01:49:23.800 --> 01:49:28.080]  hellish eugenics system they want to set up I want listeners to really have a
[01:49:28.080 --> 01:49:32.200]  gut-check moment that's not rhetoric you just heard that's not hype this is the
[01:49:32.200 --> 01:49:39.360]  truth we are all that stands between humanity and absolute dehumanization
[01:49:39.360 --> 01:49:45.360]  this is this is the most scientific most wicked group humanity has ever faced
[01:49:45.360 --> 01:49:52.000]  and we are having an effect to the point of in their top councils they are
[01:49:52.000 --> 01:49:56.800]  afraid because they know that we know that they are a pack of criminals and
[01:49:56.800 --> 01:50:00.560]  illegitimate and if we keep carrying this message and if they can't demonize
[01:50:00.560 --> 01:50:05.480]  us what they're trying to do they're going down let's go ahead and take a
[01:50:05.480 --> 01:50:07.840]  call patent California you're on the air
[01:50:07.840 --> 01:50:12.400]  I like how you know good go ahead okay hey real quick you had a gentleman on
[01:50:12.400 --> 01:50:15.960]  yesterday the Marine he said he was kind of like we adapt and was kind of set up
[01:50:15.960 --> 01:50:19.720]  hey just I want to use him for presence because basically I'm a union
[01:50:19.720 --> 01:50:24.200]  plumber laid off San Jose they told us no work for two years they're gonna try to
[01:50:24.200 --> 01:50:28.520]  jam this healthcare bill down our throat with what 300 and some things taxes
[01:50:28.520 --> 01:50:32.480]  everybody's losing their job there's no word that then takes the union healthcare
[01:50:32.480 --> 01:50:36.720]  you paid for yeah oh it's it's unbelievable I paid 1046 an hour it's
[01:50:36.720 --> 01:50:41.960]  ridiculous I know and but what I see is who's gonna pay for this are they
[01:50:41.960 --> 01:50:46.000]  insane I really believe that we need to peacefully get up if they pass this
[01:50:46.000 --> 01:50:50.040]  healthcare bill and get to the streets peacefully say this is enough I'd stay

[01:54:52.600 --> 01:54:58.000]  back to pat pat I understand you can't be pushed any further you don't have
[01:54:58.000 --> 01:55:02.360]  money to pay eight hundred cities plus or sanctuary cities the illegals don't
[01:55:02.360 --> 01:55:07.120]  get arrested for no driver's license or insurance or drunk driving you do they're
[01:55:07.120 --> 01:55:09.920]  saying they're gonna take even if they make you lose your job they're gonna take
[01:55:09.920 --> 01:55:14.720]  your money that they made union people pay into all these years that's in the
[01:55:14.720 --> 01:55:18.320]  healthcare bill they're gonna take away your good healthcare they're talking
[01:55:18.320 --> 01:55:23.520]  about taking people's money markets and the government not insuring it they're
[01:55:23.520 --> 01:55:27.240]  saying they're gonna take pension funds and then only pay you part of it back I
[01:55:27.240 --> 01:55:32.080]  mean Wayne Paul I'm even blown away by how criminal this government is it does
[01:55:32.080 --> 01:55:37.360]  appear they've gone insane and are trying to make people revolt Wayne Paul and
[01:55:37.360 --> 01:55:44.800]  I think that is true you want to have peaceful resistance using liberty and
[01:55:44.800 --> 01:55:51.480]  freedom as your basis and you want to oppose the tyranny that's being put upon
[01:55:51.480 --> 01:55:59.000]  us by our present government they would just assume that you turn around and
[01:55:59.000 --> 01:56:03.240]  try to ride in the streets then they would have an excuse to put us all in
[01:56:03.240 --> 01:56:11.520]  prison but the answer is peaceful resistant through education and voicing
[01:56:11.520 --> 01:56:17.560]  the right of liberty through the Constitution creating the freedoms we
[01:56:17.560 --> 01:56:22.360]  need to live on a daily basis but what Pat's saying is what happens as he goes
[01:56:22.360 --> 01:56:27.000]  bankrupt and they show up to throw him out of his house when they're taxing him
[01:56:27.000 --> 01:56:31.600]  for a banker bailout that was never used for his house I mean what happens when
[01:56:31.600 --> 01:56:36.320]  we have ten times as many homeless people on the street I don't have an
[01:56:36.320 --> 01:56:40.800]  answer for that because that's a real possibility and it's something that we
[01:56:40.800 --> 01:56:46.480]  have to individually help each other as much as possible we're gonna find
[01:56:46.480 --> 01:56:51.880]  communities taking care of communities pretty soon the wealthiest nation in the
[01:56:51.880 --> 01:56:57.600]  world the apple of the planet's eye in just a few decades taken over like
[01:56:57.600 --> 01:57:02.120]  Nigeria or Greece and bankrupted by the criminal banks I mean this has been a
[01:57:02.120 --> 01:57:09.840]  premeditated heist anything else Pat I'm sorry about that Alex a two weeks
[01:57:09.840 --> 01:57:14.480]  weeks ago I went to the courthouse to stop my house at auction okay I filed a
[01:57:14.480 --> 01:57:18.680]  civil suit people don't know the rules about asking for the original docs and
[01:57:18.680 --> 01:57:22.280]  all that and I was talking out loud and next to me was the guy in a suit so I
[01:57:22.280 --> 01:57:26.040]  started talking to him about the Federal Reserve ended up he was from Chase one
[01:57:26.040 --> 01:57:29.480]  of the guys supposed to buy my house and I said the people understand what's
[01:57:29.480 --> 01:57:35.160]  going on and he looked at me and says 90% of them have no clue so I did what you
[01:57:35.160 --> 01:57:39.680]  said yesterday I printed out pages of info wars fall the Republic about
[01:57:39.680 --> 01:57:46.240]  fluoride etc I handed out 75 and 45 minutes and I had my Obama Joker shirt

[02:00:20.400 --> 02:00:28.840]  Alex Jones when Wayne Paul was on six months ago we couldn't get into it but
[02:00:28.840 --> 02:00:33.080]  he has a case with the IRS himself he wants to tell you about that now then
[02:00:33.080 --> 02:00:38.320]  Bob Chapman's coming up Wayne break down your saga with these scallywags
[02:00:38.320 --> 02:00:44.760]  approximately six months ago I was asked to be a witness in a trial in Federal
[02:00:44.760 --> 02:00:53.560]  Court in Las Vegas, Nevada dealing with 17 people who were contracting with each
[02:00:53.560 --> 02:01:01.720]  other under a gold and silver coin contract which is authorized under
[02:01:01.720 --> 02:01:10.640]  Title 31 of the US Code at that time or prior to that time of those 17 13 were
[02:01:10.640 --> 02:01:19.200]  acquitted by a jury the remaining three or four had hung juries and the
[02:01:19.200 --> 02:01:27.440]  government back six months ago now and tried these people for willful failure to
[02:01:27.440 --> 02:01:34.880]  file a tax return and it's all based upon the fact that you and I can have an
[02:01:34.880 --> 02:01:45.280]  agreement to do a work I can hire Alex to to fill me and I'll pay him $50 in
[02:01:45.280 --> 02:01:50.520]  coin money and there's even a congressional law even the Las Vegas
[02:01:50.520 --> 02:01:56.360]  Review Journal admitted what from the 80s stating that you're absolutely allowed
[02:01:56.360 --> 02:02:06.720]  to do that sure but yeah absolutely 1985 and that that was the gold bullion act
[02:02:06.720 --> 02:02:16.560]  and the silver Eagle Act which was the two deals that my brother was involved
[02:02:16.560 --> 02:02:25.200]  in in order to get it passed in Congress and what's happened since then is in
[02:02:25.200 --> 02:02:31.520]  the case that I witnessed that I was a witness for I spent about seven and a
[02:02:31.520 --> 02:02:39.120]  half hours and over two days on the stand as a witness for one of the
[02:02:39.120 --> 02:02:48.080]  defendant and I pointed out the the Congressional Act I pointed out Title
[02:02:48.080 --> 02:02:56.000]  31 of the US Code which is money and banking I pointed out the four or five
[02:02:56.000 --> 02:03:03.640]  uh tax cases that are available there's an 1899 tax case that and you helped him
[02:03:03.640 --> 02:03:10.360]  win and then now suddenly you're being audited as a CPA yeah well that standard
[02:03:10.360 --> 02:03:14.920]  procedure I believe well take take take of Treasury agent who found that it was
[02:03:14.920 --> 02:03:19.240]  all a scam he testified in some court cases for people Joe Bannister they
[02:03:19.240 --> 02:03:23.320]  indicted him tried to put him in prison but the jury let him go so the good
[02:03:23.320 --> 02:03:28.000]  news is more and more juries are learning the truth that is absolutely
[02:03:28.000 --> 02:03:37.640]  right but that's all part of education and all part of the the quiet resistance
[02:03:37.640 --> 02:03:44.120]  that we need to have in everything that we do you got one minute left when we
[02:03:44.120 --> 02:03:48.880]  really appreciate you spending time with us more on that case well I would like
[02:03:48.880 --> 02:03:55.360]  to if it's all right with you Alex I would like to put out a website that

[02:04:05.200 --> 02:04:16.080]  is the solution dot com and you can read about that court case and learn what
[02:04:16.080 --> 02:04:22.640]  what's been going on in that because that case is now up on appeal well for
[02:04:22.640 --> 02:04:26.240]  those that don't know and I got Bob Chapman online but I'm sure he's fine if

[02:04:47.960 --> 02:04:52.480]  trying to say no you can't have this form of constitutional really barter
[02:04:52.480 --> 02:04:56.440]  it's like saying you can't pay your neighbor and animal crackers if you
[02:04:56.440 --> 02:05:00.400]  agree with it stay there let me talk to you during the break and we're coming

[02:08:01.120 --> 02:08:08.600]  he's the t-rex of political talk Alex Jones on the GCN radio network
[02:08:08.600 --> 02:08:12.080]  all right doing a few more minutes with Wayne Ball because this issue he brought
[02:08:12.080 --> 02:08:16.000]  up is so important it's a case I followed closely and I didn't know he was
[02:08:16.000 --> 02:08:18.920]  ready to talk about it because at the time being involved in the court cases
[02:08:18.920 --> 02:08:22.480]  an expert witness he didn't want to discuss it I should have gotten to it
[02:08:22.480 --> 02:08:26.120]  earlier in the interview another expert on gold and currency in the markets is
[02:08:26.120 --> 02:08:29.360]  Bob Chapman of the international forecaster I'm Alex Jones of info
[02:08:29.360 --> 02:08:36.520]  wars dot com and under federal law 1985 and this other congressional laws you
[02:08:36.520 --> 02:08:41.760]  can trade in gold and silver and pay people in its face value so it's a ten
[02:08:41.760 --> 02:08:46.360]  dollar coin worth in federal reserve notes say five hundred and fifty dollars
[02:08:46.360 --> 02:08:53.160]  right now or six hundred dollars or more than the supposed you know tax rate
[02:08:53.160 --> 02:08:56.600]  of that would be 20 or 30 or whatever the percentage is in the of that amount
[02:08:56.600 --> 02:08:59.960]  but then some experts look at it to say now there's it's not even taxable
[02:08:59.960 --> 02:09:05.120]  regardless Wayne Paul went and was an expert witness and now they're auditing
[02:09:05.120 --> 02:09:13.040]  him this is what an evil oppressive Soviet style group the IRS is that that
[02:09:13.040 --> 02:09:17.440]  they would persecute people who even testify in court as a CPA this is the
[02:09:17.440 --> 02:09:21.840]  type of dirty tricks this criminal organization engages in and drives
[02:09:21.840 --> 02:09:27.280]  people to madness but but Wayne finish up your point boil down the essence of
[02:09:27.280 --> 02:09:31.520]  why gold is the solution and we'll put up this website you were plugging that
[02:09:31.520 --> 02:09:41.320]  has a lot of key info on it well I well when I was a witness I also prepared
[02:09:41.320 --> 02:09:47.560]  the tax return for the defendant and he had instructions from a federal judge
[02:09:47.560 --> 02:09:57.000]  that he had to prepare return based upon the fair market value of the coins he
[02:09:57.000 --> 02:10:04.880]  received and I turned around and said as a professional I had to prepare it
[02:10:04.880 --> 02:10:12.920]  based on the face value so I prepared to tax return for the defendant because
[02:10:12.920 --> 02:10:16.440]  that's the federal law you were pat you were following the congressional law and
[02:10:16.440 --> 02:10:20.320]  in the Constitution it's the Congress that's over that they're the boss not
[02:10:20.320 --> 02:10:27.120]  the IRS that works for foreign banks so I prepared to return and we couldn't
[02:10:27.120 --> 02:10:33.240]  decide what to do so we sent them to the the attorney sent them to the IRS so the
[02:10:33.240 --> 02:10:38.880]  IRS would tell us which was the correct one and guess what they never answered
[02:10:38.880 --> 02:10:45.280]  our question and so at trial the prosecuting attorney says why did you
[02:10:45.280 --> 02:10:50.560]  turn around prepared to tax return and I said well that's a dumb question but
[02:10:50.560 --> 02:10:56.080]  I'll answer it anyway I said the judge here and I pointed to the judge next to
[02:10:56.080 --> 02:11:02.600]  me I said he said I and the defendant had it prepared on fair market value and I
[02:11:02.600 --> 02:11:09.720]  said I had a prepared based upon what the law said and I said Mr. Prosecutor if
[02:11:09.720 --> 02:11:12.720]  you were sitting in the defendant's chair when you want to have all the
[02:11:12.720 --> 02:11:18.320]  ammunition you could get in order to defend yourself and of course he didn't
[02:11:18.320 --> 02:11:23.960]  like that is an answer but I think a few people in the courtroom understood what
[02:11:23.960 --> 02:11:28.840]  I was trying to say well cutting to the chaser this is so important what was the
[02:11:28.840 --> 02:11:40.800]  outcome of the case the outcome of the case is one person was acquitted the
[02:11:40.800 --> 02:11:48.640]  other one that I did was a witness for got sentenced to four years but is is out
[02:11:48.640 --> 02:11:54.920]  on bond pending appeal the third gentleman got something like 20 years
[02:11:54.920 --> 02:12:03.600]  and he's in jail but everything's under appeal right now going up to the federal
[02:12:03.600 --> 02:12:08.280]  I believe it's the fifth circuit if I'm not mistaken unbelievable let's bring
[02:12:08.280 --> 02:12:12.680]  Bob Chapman up talking about this Bob from your research talking with Wayne
[02:12:12.680 --> 02:12:17.360]  Paul CPA and brother of Ron Paul the congressman what's your take on this
[02:12:17.360 --> 02:12:24.480]  whole case well it they don't care what the Constitution says they they have
[02:12:24.480 --> 02:12:31.840]  their their own method of operating the court system and unfortunately you have
[02:12:31.840 --> 02:12:38.800]  no rights and by going to court you might conceivably win but the chances are
[02:12:38.800 --> 02:12:44.360]  very very strong that you won't because judges do what they're told to do most
[02:12:44.360 --> 02:12:51.640]  of them are appointed and so especially in federal district court and so you know
[02:12:51.640 --> 02:12:57.080]  you you don't get a good day in court yeah we have the night circuit court of
[02:12:57.080 --> 02:13:01.080]  appeals the night circuit of appeals two weeks ago ruled there's no fourth
[02:13:01.080 --> 02:13:04.640]  amendment police can come in your house without a warrant now with no with no
[02:13:04.640 --> 02:13:08.920]  probable cause I mean this is insane well what is going to lead to
[02:13:08.920 --> 02:13:14.760]  unfortunately ultimately is probably anarchy and you know maybe that's the
[02:13:14.760 --> 02:13:19.840]  intention of the power behind government I personally because of my political
[02:13:19.840 --> 02:13:28.240]  activities was audited 12 years in a row and I never was found to owe tax and
[02:13:28.240 --> 02:13:35.080]  because that's illegal because if they find that you do not own tax they can't
[02:13:35.080 --> 02:13:40.040]  audit you on the same night same items for the following three years they do
[02:13:40.040 --> 02:13:44.120]  it anyway well that's like you know the government accounting office and others
[02:13:44.120 --> 02:13:48.360]  80 plus percent of the letters they send there they're wrong even in their
[02:13:48.360 --> 02:13:52.600]  fraudulent system they're wrong and then they never get in trouble for it and
[02:13:52.600 --> 02:13:56.200]  then when they audit you and it costs you all this money over the audit they
[02:13:56.200 --> 02:14:00.760]  don't get in trouble but as a private citizen you frivolously sue somebody you
[02:14:00.760 --> 02:14:04.440]  can be opened up a serious liability I mean it's just a lawless disgusting
[02:14:04.440 --> 02:14:09.760]  filthy group will talk to Wayne Paul again soon as this case continues to
[02:14:09.760 --> 02:14:13.800]  unfold Wayne we appreciate your great courage and your tireless fight against
[02:14:13.800 --> 02:14:19.400]  the new world order thanks Alex I appreciate it have a great weekend say
[02:14:19.400 --> 02:14:23.920]  how to run for me next week okay I'll do it all right take care there he goes
[02:14:23.920 --> 02:14:29.280]  another great Texan okay going back to Bob Chapman with us for the rest of the
[02:14:29.280 --> 02:14:33.480]  hour Bob there's so much I want to cover here but every week we get you on in the
[02:14:33.480 --> 02:14:40.680]  third hour and I just have to say how do you call it I mean I've seen no expert
[02:14:40.680 --> 02:14:44.440]  not Nobel Prize winner sticklets not even Dr. Paul Greg Roberts and he's been
[02:14:44.440 --> 02:14:49.200]  very accurate not I mean Gerald Salon he does a great job on trends but the way
[02:14:49.200 --> 02:14:55.480]  you specifically two years ago called how the bailout would happen and then
[02:14:55.480 --> 02:15:00.800]  how they come back in 2010 and try to fully bankrupt the planet eight months
[02:15:00.800 --> 02:15:07.360]  ago how they were planning to bring down starting with Spain and Greece and then
[02:15:07.360 --> 02:15:11.920]  14 other nations that's now the media is now I was looking to Bloomberg financial
[02:15:11.920 --> 02:15:18.040]  last night this morning on the radio on my XM I have serious was it was like
[02:15:18.040 --> 02:15:21.840]  Bob Chapman was talking but they were snickering and giggling and saying how
[02:15:21.840 --> 02:15:24.960]  great it was and how the banks have record profits and how they've gotten
[02:15:24.960 --> 02:15:31.400]  more power and they're just laughing on CNBC and everywhere else they're saying
[02:15:31.400 --> 02:15:37.640]  Greece may have to give the private IMF World Bank and EU bankers their islands
[02:15:37.640 --> 02:15:41.840]  that are large parts of Greece it's an island to begin with Goldman Sachs it's
[02:15:41.840 --> 02:15:45.560]  come out 10 years ago and you wrote about this 10 years ago engineered this now
[02:15:45.560 --> 02:15:49.320]  they are fully running the country the same things that were done to the third
[02:15:49.320 --> 02:15:52.960]  world are now being done here they're openly announcing their bank of the
[02:15:52.960 --> 02:15:57.400]  world world government taking over in the next 16 months carbon taxes on
[02:15:57.400 --> 02:16:02.160]  everyone it's coming out police have quotas to arrest innocent people give
[02:16:02.160 --> 02:16:09.000]  out tickets I mean it is just it is hellish and it's one thing to know this
[02:16:09.000 --> 02:16:12.480]  is coming it's nothing to see it happening so Bob how do you do it a and
[02:16:12.480 --> 02:16:19.440]  B what's coming next now well first of all I do a terrific amount of research
[02:16:19.440 --> 02:16:25.800]  and you know I've been right I reading and writing for 50 years and so I'm very
[02:16:25.800 --> 02:16:31.600]  gifted in the fact that I have a photographic memory and I remember a
[02:16:31.600 --> 02:16:38.680]  little details that happened many many years ago even statistics and so I I've
[02:16:38.680 --> 02:16:44.880]  got a God-given gift and so I'm able to put together a lot of things that other
[02:16:44.880 --> 02:16:51.480]  people can't put together because I don't have that equipment but it really
[02:16:51.480 --> 02:16:58.120]  really takes a lot of hard work and you were just speaking about the situation
[02:16:58.120 --> 02:17:03.760]  in Greece and in Europe which we've discussed last week and and what you
[02:17:03.760 --> 02:17:08.040]  wrote about ten years ago you said Greece will be the first to go ten years
[02:17:08.040 --> 02:17:13.200]  ago you know well not only that I I thought Italy would be right with them
[02:17:13.200 --> 02:17:17.040]  and I don't think they're gonna be far hard far behind and one of the reasons
[02:17:17.040 --> 02:17:22.920]  is that Italy I believe and of course it's a secret I think they've I think
[02:17:22.920 --> 02:17:29.000]  they leased out which attempt amount of selling more than half the gold that
[02:17:29.000 --> 02:17:35.440]  they had and I think it's long gone and so they're any worse position than they
[02:17:35.440 --> 02:17:40.080]  were ten years ago and by the way 15 years ago you and many others and myself
[02:17:40.080 --> 02:17:44.960]  14 years ago exposed that the UN takes over National Parks and Land and Roads
[02:17:44.960 --> 02:17:49.200]  for the IMF and World Bank and that deals have been signed for the US and when
[02:17:49.200 --> 02:17:53.320]  they sold out 25 ports two years ago they admitted this was part of that and
[02:17:53.320 --> 02:17:57.200]  now they're telling Greece give us your islands and your infrastructure and now
[02:17:57.200 --> 02:18:00.400]  we've got the leader of the Democrats and the Senate saying they're gonna do
[02:18:00.400 --> 02:18:09.000]  that here in the United States I mean I mean absolutely I think what's going to
[02:18:09.000 --> 02:18:15.440]  happen in Europe is that the US will secretly be the largest donor to the
[02:18:15.440 --> 02:18:22.640]  bailout followed by France and Germany unfortunately for them and the so-called
[02:18:22.640 --> 02:18:26.320]  bailout will just be our tax money buying Greece to give it to the bankers
[02:18:26.320 --> 02:18:32.400]  right and I don't think they'll give up their islands but it was brought up
[02:18:32.400 --> 02:18:36.000]  there's no question and of course the brakes brought up the question of
[02:18:36.000 --> 02:18:41.640]  German gold and the Greeks got the goal back and it's in this issue coming out
[02:18:41.640 --> 02:18:46.000]  tomorrow the International Forecaster was a letter to the editor someone wrote
[02:18:46.000 --> 02:18:57.160]  to me and described how the whole thing went and so the explanations by the
[02:18:57.160 --> 02:19:02.800]  Greeks are untrue I've seen the other side of the story as well so let's just
[02:19:02.800 --> 02:19:08.520]  put it this way it's up for debate there's two sides to that story but what's
[02:19:08.520 --> 02:19:15.000]  going to happen is and and the reason the bankers did this that down the road
[02:19:15.000 --> 02:19:24.440]  here in a year or two there's 19 countries who are either in bankruptcy but
[02:19:24.440 --> 02:19:30.760]  not declared I guess the only one that might be declared as Iceland and or on
[02:19:30.760 --> 02:19:37.160]  the edge like the United States and and Great Britain and perhaps Ireland and
[02:19:37.160 --> 02:19:42.400]  Spain and Portugal as well and perhaps even Italy the point is they're gonna
[02:19:42.400 --> 02:19:47.000]  great gather them all together and have their big meeting and they're going to
[02:19:47.000 --> 02:19:52.120]  realign all the currencies there'll be domestic devaluations all over the world
[02:19:52.120 --> 02:19:56.960]  stay there let's start over on the big world government the bankers bankrupt

[02:24:19.640 --> 02:24:23.280]  Nobel Prize-winning economists federal reserve system is corrupt and

[02:24:27.920 --> 02:24:34.040]  continuing here I've got all these other news articles admitting here's Joseph
[02:24:34.040 --> 02:24:37.760]  Stickle it's again saying it's corrupt undermining our country IMF style
[02:24:37.760 --> 02:24:41.440]  austerity measures come to America everything that's been done in other
[02:24:41.440 --> 02:24:45.280]  countries now happening here we're coming to this critical juncture where
[02:24:45.280 --> 02:24:49.320]  we're going into total bondage to private banks who are setting up their own
[02:24:49.320 --> 02:24:54.440]  government and getting the G20 together to sign on to it Bob Chapman continue
[02:24:54.440 --> 02:25:02.480]  where we cut you off well I think that the Greek affair will call it was
[02:25:02.480 --> 02:25:07.400]  instigated and executed because they're gonna take all these countries down
[02:25:07.400 --> 02:25:11.960]  they're ready to do it it'll happen sometime over the next couple of years
[02:25:11.960 --> 02:25:19.480]  if probably more so a year or more from now but you know who knows but that's
[02:25:19.480 --> 02:25:24.080]  that's what they're steaming for now I was really surprised they pulled it that
[02:25:24.080 --> 02:25:32.600]  way and did it that way I just didn't expect it because most people who look
[02:25:32.600 --> 02:25:38.520]  at these kinds of things in Europe they do all about this I mean grief in
[02:25:38.520 --> 02:25:42.800]  Italy's problems wait a minute I mean you're saying you're surprised you
[02:25:42.800 --> 02:25:49.040]  predicted all of this I know but I'm surprised that they went at it this way
[02:25:49.040 --> 02:25:55.120]  because it's been common knowledge that the all these countries weren't we're
[02:25:55.120 --> 02:26:01.000]  problematic I thought they'd probably do something with the US execute some sort
[02:26:01.000 --> 02:26:08.320]  of a move which would take the country down and maybe they yet will to join
[02:26:08.320 --> 02:26:13.360]  the others so to speak but the culmination of the whole thing is that
[02:26:13.360 --> 02:26:19.240]  what they're about now is taking the whole world down and I think that's not
[02:26:19.240 --> 02:26:23.960]  too far away you know a year ago we talked about talked about three years
[02:26:23.960 --> 02:26:28.600]  and now we're talking about two years it but it could be a little bit more
[02:26:28.600 --> 02:26:33.920]  expeditious well what von Roompi saying head of the EU what ban Kyman head of
[02:26:33.920 --> 02:26:38.200]  the UN saying what Gordon Brown who really is the omnibudsman of this he
[02:26:38.200 --> 02:26:41.640]  says in the next 16 months they're gonna form their global banking
[02:26:41.640 --> 02:26:46.680]  constitution over all nations and they said from Copenhagen they don't care of
[02:26:46.680 --> 02:26:51.640]  nations don't sign on the executive branches will implement this and they're
[02:26:51.640 --> 02:26:56.960]  just celebrating well I don't know whether to be celebrating at that time
[02:26:56.960 --> 02:27:01.800]  because the people of the world I I think are finally gonna say no we had
[02:27:01.800 --> 02:27:08.480]  enough of this we are seeing riots in Indonesia riots in California or serious
[02:27:08.480 --> 02:27:15.320]  protests a riots in in European countries like Greece why do the Greeks
[02:27:15.320 --> 02:27:21.160]  and the Indonesians get what's going on but a lot of Americans don't well I
[02:27:21.160 --> 02:27:25.680]  don't think it's gotten a gift on difficult enough yet and of course not
[02:27:25.680 --> 02:27:31.320]  everybody listens to talk radio or goes on the internet and so you have half or
[02:27:31.320 --> 02:27:35.960]  more of the population that never never comes in contact with this sort of thing
[02:27:35.960 --> 02:27:41.120]  and so that's why they don't know in Europeans and and others in other
[02:27:41.120 --> 02:27:48.080]  countries a far more curious than Americans are Americans tend to be very
[02:27:48.080 --> 02:27:54.400]  provincial most Americans never leave the United States in fact most don't go
[02:27:54.400 --> 02:28:03.200]  more than 500 miles from where they were born and they think their government
[02:28:03.200 --> 02:28:06.120]  loves them and cares about them but more and more of the polls show they're
[02:28:06.120 --> 02:28:10.280]  waking up that that's not the case they think good guys run America when
[02:28:10.280 --> 02:28:14.000]  America's been captured by private banks
[02:28:14.200 --> 02:28:20.120]  among other things but the the strat of the the strata that's controlled by the
[02:28:20.120 --> 02:28:26.680]  Illuminous and that includes many other things but the bank is certainly the
[02:28:26.680 --> 02:28:30.760]  nexus of the whole thing that there's no question about that you know money
[02:28:30.760 --> 02:28:36.160]  makes it all work and banking is now Wall Street as well because they've many
[02:28:36.160 --> 02:28:41.160]  of them have become banks in order to get tarp funds so they didn't go totally
[02:28:41.160 --> 02:28:48.680]  bankrupt at that time and so I think it's a periphery of things you know
[02:28:48.680 --> 02:28:54.400]  seven major insurance companies got tarp money they haven't paid it back and I
[02:28:54.400 --> 02:28:59.040]  noticed with this cell thing they've had a record amount of money that's been
[02:28:59.040 --> 02:29:03.520]  requested before it's terminated and once they terminate these programs and
[02:29:03.520 --> 02:29:08.040]  the stimulus runs out things are going to head downward nice that's what's
[02:29:08.040 --> 02:29:12.720]  incredible I saw an NBC headline where they just cut Medicare and Medicaid by
[02:29:12.720 --> 02:29:20.760]  21% outside of any law they're cutting all the supposed services while jacking
[02:29:20.760 --> 02:29:25.760]  up the taxes I mean they've got to know that's going to cause a revolt well they
[02:29:25.760 --> 02:29:31.160]  also got to know that it's going to cause more unemployment too and so after
[02:29:31.160 --> 02:29:35.960]  this stimulus runs out it's going to be everybody for himself and next year will
[02:29:35.960 --> 02:29:41.640]  be horrendous and all of these things will start coming to four and and in
[02:29:41.640 --> 02:29:45.840]  in instituting what they're doing what you just described and I'm describing

[02:33:12.920 --> 02:33:17.720]  forecaster I want to get into a bunch of news with you on other interlocking
[02:33:17.720 --> 02:33:21.320]  subjects here in a moment but we got cut off by the break I had brought up the
[02:33:21.320 --> 02:33:24.920]  point for listeners that just joined us that they know they're driving everyone
[02:33:24.920 --> 02:33:28.160]  into bankruptcy they know they're destroying the economy we have all the
[02:33:28.160 --> 02:33:31.560]  internal globalist documents their public statements they want to end
[02:33:31.560 --> 02:33:36.400]  consumerism they they use it to get us in debt now they want to lower our carbon
[02:33:36.400 --> 02:33:40.160]  footprint they want to bankrupt us so we're dependent on government this is
[02:33:40.160 --> 02:33:46.600]  economic conquest this is bondage and you are agreeing with me it's
[02:33:46.600 --> 02:33:51.680]  to make a point as we ran into break right and I think we're going to see
[02:33:51.680 --> 02:33:58.440]  inflation build up very quickly over the next perhaps 12 months and after that
[02:33:58.440 --> 02:34:02.920]  they'll probably pull the plug and they'll take all of these nations down
[02:34:02.920 --> 02:34:07.040]  together in the whole world will go with them and that's where I think this is
[02:34:07.040 --> 02:34:15.080]  all headed and that's why they triggered grief as the governmental leader into
[02:34:15.080 --> 02:34:22.000]  the abyss so to speak and of course if they continue to have higher unemployment
[02:34:22.000 --> 02:34:27.640]  and lower economic output that will bring on deflation and cut off the
[02:34:27.640 --> 02:34:33.480]  inflation which is in process so that's the will be their way of getting rid of
[02:34:33.480 --> 02:34:39.360]  the inflation which they've created and will dive into a deflation or a
[02:34:39.360 --> 02:34:45.880]  depression and we will nation by nation get in trouble and then they'll have
[02:34:45.880 --> 02:34:51.960]  their big meeting and they'll try to institute a world currency which won't
[02:34:51.960 --> 02:34:57.320]  work and but they do I do think that they'll they will be able to put into
[02:34:57.320 --> 02:35:07.400]  place a world economic trading currency with G20 currencies in an index that
[02:35:07.400 --> 02:35:11.080]  would be weighted and I think that that's going to happen we're going to
[02:35:11.080 --> 02:35:15.520]  get more into gold and the economy and ways to stop this because if we expose
[02:35:15.520 --> 02:35:19.400]  these people and point out what they're doing it's going to be that much harder
[02:35:19.400 --> 02:35:22.000]  and people thought we couldn't beat Copenhagen and we did they thought we
[02:35:22.000 --> 02:35:26.640]  couldn't expose the flu fraud we've done that the media now admits it's a hoax
[02:35:26.640 --> 02:35:29.800]  they didn't think we could beat healthcare we've got a great chance of
[02:35:29.800 --> 02:35:33.320]  doing it now we've gone from it being impossible they told us to it's very
[02:35:33.320 --> 02:35:38.040]  hard for them to get it passed again the people are waking up and I wanted to
[02:35:38.040 --> 02:35:45.080]  shift gears into some other subjects now here with you Bob Chapman chief among
[02:35:45.080 --> 02:35:54.280]  them as predicted we now have all these big headlines 9-11 truther shoots
[02:35:54.280 --> 02:36:00.720]  police at Pentagon and within two hours of this event they had his name they had
[02:36:00.720 --> 02:36:05.120]  his supposed web comments on message boards you've got depending on the
[02:36:05.120 --> 02:36:09.120]  poll 36 to 84 percent it's it's wide-ranging with the lowest polls
[02:36:09.120 --> 02:36:14.840]  scientific or 36 our 9-11 truthers question the official story so I guess
[02:36:14.840 --> 02:36:19.920]  anytime a third of the country commits a crime they'll say they were a 9-11
[02:36:19.920 --> 02:36:25.640]  truther I saw Beck and O'Reilly and I also saw Matthews and others the last
[02:36:25.640 --> 02:36:29.080]  two months you've been on the show when I've been warning of this saying 9-11
[02:36:29.080 --> 02:36:34.920]  truthers are going to kill Obama attack bases mark my words and what an off the
[02:36:34.920 --> 02:36:39.680]  wall statement from peaceful 9-11 truth and who've just read Operation North
[02:36:39.680 --> 02:36:43.160]  was another things with the government admits what they do unless they were
[02:36:43.160 --> 02:36:47.160]  pre-programming people then I saw their whole agenda in trouble now they're
[02:36:47.160 --> 02:36:50.960]  tying it into birthers now they're saying birthers are terrorists when
[02:36:50.960 --> 02:36:54.120]  that's more than half of registered Republicans who question Obama's birth
[02:36:54.120 --> 02:36:58.040]  certificate and so you've got the patriots that recognize the enemy banks
[02:36:58.040 --> 02:37:02.520]  the new world order and they're going to need to run false flags against us and
[02:37:02.520 --> 02:37:06.680]  now more evidence the stacked thing was staged we know the underwear bombing
[02:37:06.680 --> 02:37:09.480]  was staged the feds even admitted they helped him get on the plane protecting
[02:37:09.480 --> 02:37:13.400]  him for part of national security operation that's mainstream news this
[02:37:13.400 --> 02:37:18.120]  thing stinks to high heaven becks now out today just absolutely going crazy
[02:37:18.120 --> 02:37:24.800]  saying see I told you see I told you and I'm trying to find my times of London
[02:37:24.800 --> 02:37:29.240]  headline here it is give me a document cam shot for prison planet dot TV viewers
[02:37:29.240 --> 02:37:34.960]  September 11 conspiracy theorist opens fire at Pentagon and within two hours of
[02:37:34.960 --> 02:37:39.920]  it they had these headlines going out Bob and then we had the case of Jeremy
[02:37:39.920 --> 02:37:44.360]  tell us we are changer out there protesting the police and firemen and
[02:37:44.360 --> 02:37:49.320]  medical workers dying from the dust at an event out of a dark doorway comes a
[02:37:49.320 --> 02:37:53.880]  man with a candy cap girl in a wheelchair screaming don't attack my
[02:37:53.880 --> 02:37:58.920]  daughter ramming and into him the witnesses all saw this that the news
[02:37:58.920 --> 02:38:02.440]  put out that 9 11 truth or attacks handicapped girl look at our stage that
[02:38:02.440 --> 02:38:05.560]  is and then they went to court and fought it and I told tell us don't
[02:38:05.560 --> 02:38:08.880]  play bargain when you have the witnesses and the secret service wouldn't lie
[02:38:08.880 --> 02:38:14.760]  NYPD did and said no he was attacked they attacked him and so they lost in
[02:38:14.760 --> 02:38:19.200]  court the New York Post had to retract the point is they're running serious
[02:38:19.200 --> 02:38:23.960]  psyops the Southern Prairie Law Center says they believe the Patriots a launch
[02:38:23.960 --> 02:38:27.800]  terror attacks in mid-April I've been saying that for months because I know
[02:38:27.800 --> 02:38:33.680]  there's five TV productions from MSNBC to HBO to CNN and Fox and CNBC
[02:38:33.680 --> 02:38:39.080]  demonizing yours truly Alex Jones and others in production to air in the
[02:38:39.080 --> 02:38:43.320]  middle of April so they'll have all these shows demonizing us right when they
[02:38:43.320 --> 02:38:47.320]  staged the event now by exposing it may not happen but I just gave people a
[02:38:47.320 --> 02:38:53.960]  briefing on what's going on but Bob I mean this stinks to High Heaven well
[02:38:53.960 --> 02:39:00.760]  it's just true positive that as you pointed out that they are running these
[02:39:00.760 --> 02:39:09.400]  psyops and they are using in-depth psychological warfare and propaganda and
[02:39:09.400 --> 02:39:15.000]  you could even see the timing of it because you've had access to it and you
[02:39:15.000 --> 02:39:19.560]  know goodness knows that it goes on every day and very subtle and and very
[02:39:19.560 --> 02:39:27.520]  professional to fashion on television and these poor souls who watch all these
[02:39:27.520 --> 02:39:34.640]  programs in the news they don't know which end is up and that makes up
[02:39:34.640 --> 02:39:40.760]  probably half the population and so it's up to us to be able to get the word to
[02:39:40.760 --> 02:39:44.600]  them and say hey stop you know something's wrong listen to what we've got
[02:39:44.600 --> 02:39:51.720]  to say and and maybe you'll find out what is really going on and that's one of
[02:39:51.720 --> 02:39:57.600]  the problems there is that a lot of these people don't go on the internet so
[02:39:57.600 --> 02:40:04.200]  that eliminates that source completely or almost completely and so we got to get
[02:40:04.200 --> 02:40:09.880]  them on the airwaves and we're doing it the question is are we doing it fast
[02:40:09.880 --> 02:40:14.440]  enough yes the urgency for all the listeners to get the articles Paul
[02:40:14.440 --> 02:40:18.080]  Watson and Kurt Nemo have written about this the urgency of getting the videos
[02:40:18.080 --> 02:40:21.840]  in the last two months when I laid all this out out to everyone you know saying
[02:40:21.840 --> 02:40:26.000]  look he predicted this and others did the urgency of understanding this paradigm
[02:40:26.000 --> 02:40:33.280]  because again in layman's terms for new listeners let me explain I know of five
[02:40:33.280 --> 02:40:40.280]  productions for cable news and TV and I noticed when I was contacted by several
[02:40:40.280 --> 02:40:42.720]  of the productions then learned about the other productions it's all about how
[02:40:42.720 --> 02:40:47.680]  the tea parties are evil 9-11 truth is evil we're gonna stage terror I see a
[02:40:47.680 --> 02:40:51.880]  talking point on the news with no evidence of this happening then it
[02:40:51.880 --> 02:40:56.880]  starts manifesting in the lead-up to these shows that are about to air I mean
[02:40:56.880 --> 02:41:01.800]  put two and two together folks they don't just produce a bunch of shows because
[02:41:01.800 --> 02:41:05.760]  it takes months to do this it's just like the US military massing around
[02:41:05.760 --> 02:41:09.400]  Afghanistan right before 9-11 and Bush signing the launch order to attack them
[02:41:09.400 --> 02:41:16.800]  the next month on September 10th I mean this is basic intelligence and their
[02:41:16.800 --> 02:41:20.520]  whole agenda is imploding the last time that happened in 1995 they bombed
[02:41:20.520 --> 02:41:28.960]  Oklahoma City Bob that's right that's right I you know you know some of these
[02:41:28.960 --> 02:41:35.480]  things are so similar and you know you you scratch your head and you say where
[02:41:35.480 --> 02:41:40.880]  are they gonna do it next and some of the underlying factors that are there
[02:41:40.880 --> 02:41:45.520]  and have been there to do these kind of things for a long time so there's plenty
[02:41:45.520 --> 02:41:49.640]  of fertile ground I mean just like I pointed out with Greece I mean everybody
[02:41:49.640 --> 02:41:54.240]  in Europe do for the last dozen years that they in Italy fudge their books in
[02:41:54.240 --> 02:42:00.120]  order to get accepted into the engolman sacks helped him engineer it that's
[02:42:00.120 --> 02:42:06.720]  right and in part JP Morgan Chase and Citigroup particularly in Italy they
[02:42:06.720 --> 02:42:11.400]  get some terrible trouble there and there's still court cases going on some
[02:42:11.400 --> 02:42:16.320]  of the shenanigans that they pulled well Bob it's a very simple equation the
[02:42:16.320 --> 02:42:20.000]  bankers are all registering record profits the rest of the economy is going
[02:42:20.000 --> 02:42:23.720]  under the nation states are going bankrupt the bankers are celebrating the
[02:42:23.720 --> 02:42:28.200]  birth of a world government they're gonna run through nothing but complete
[02:42:28.200 --> 02:42:33.520]  fraud that they took over the planet by getting us to accept their control of
[02:42:33.520 --> 02:42:37.680]  the issuance of currency and credit they're getting rich and powerful
[02:42:37.680 --> 02:42:43.640]  everybody else is imploding they're above the law they're above the tax laws
[02:42:43.640 --> 02:42:51.800]  I mean it's incredible but certainly above the law that's for sure and more
[02:42:51.800 --> 02:42:56.200]  and more people are becoming aware of that every day Bob I want to hit another
[02:42:56.200 --> 02:43:00.720]  subject and then get into gold with you here's the hill newspaper Microsoft
[02:43:00.720 --> 02:43:07.480]  exec pitches internet usage tax to pay for cyber security okay so there they are
[02:43:07.480 --> 02:43:11.400]  with the internet tax they also want you go web licensing to get online I told
[02:43:11.400 --> 02:43:16.520]  you they're announcing all this here is wired magazine this is not Alex Jones
[02:43:16.520 --> 02:43:22.880]  saying this cyber war hype intended to destroy the open internet and they go
[02:43:22.880 --> 02:43:27.920]  on to report that this is the end of freedom on the internet as they're
[02:43:27.920 --> 02:43:31.440]  about and this is the big another big symbol another indicator they're about
[02:43:31.440 --> 02:43:35.000]  to stage terror and bring in police state because when they finally do that
[02:43:35.000 --> 02:43:39.920]  they're gonna start shutting many areas of the web off selectively fury as EU
[02:43:39.920 --> 02:43:43.600]  approves GMO potato that's another article White House cybers are says
[02:43:43.600 --> 02:43:51.600]  there is no cyber war though and then I've got another one here I mean Bob it's
[02:43:51.600 --> 02:43:55.280]  I'm sure you heard about the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruling two weeks
[02:43:55.280 --> 02:44:01.680]  ago there's no Fourth Amendment right I heard about it and you know you're
[02:44:01.680 --> 02:44:06.920]  talking about this cyber thing I've got research here Milan court sentences
[02:44:06.920 --> 02:44:13.440]  Google officials to prison for a whistle-blowing video and then we got
[02:44:13.440 --> 02:44:20.600]  another one here from the out of the anti-counterfeiting trade agreement so
[02:44:20.600 --> 02:44:26.680]  that they can spy on you and we got another one here broadband attacks in
[02:44:26.680 --> 02:44:32.400]  Great Britain that they want to institute which is similar to what you
[02:44:32.400 --> 02:44:38.520]  just read from the Hill the French net is filtering as a filtering plan and
[02:44:38.520 --> 02:44:45.800]  it's moving forward in the assembly in in France Italy's government seeks
[02:44:45.800 --> 02:44:51.520]  control over online videos and just goes on and on you just got to do your
[02:44:51.520 --> 02:44:56.600]  homework on it but they are building up to it and that's one subject that I keep
[02:44:56.600 --> 02:45:01.960]  my research out because it comes up fairly often on the programs that I'm
[02:45:01.960 --> 02:45:05.960]  exactly here's another one info wars.net former director of national
[02:45:05.960 --> 02:45:09.600]  intelligence calls for re-engineering of the internet they're already seizing the
[02:45:09.600 --> 02:45:13.640]  whole system putting their control grid in I mean I want listeners to know when
[02:45:13.640 --> 02:45:17.360]  Bob and I get up here on the show and others we don't we're not just making
[02:45:17.360 --> 02:45:21.400]  this up to be shocking I've been telling you for years under internet to they were
[02:45:21.400 --> 02:45:24.440]  gonna do exactly what they're doing now because I was reading their own white
[02:45:24.440 --> 02:45:29.800]  papers this is not rocket science okay Bob I want to bring Ted Anderson up and
[02:45:29.800 --> 02:45:33.480]  come back in the next segment and take a few calls for you but I want to bring
[02:45:33.480 --> 02:45:36.960]  Ted Anderson up because he's got a deal and he's the owner of the Genesis
[02:45:36.960 --> 02:45:41.600]  Network he also owns minus resources where he's giving your 159 year
[02:45:41.600 --> 02:45:46.960]  membership and hard copy or twice a week in email 45 pages the most invaluable
[02:45:46.960 --> 02:45:52.000]  newsletter I know of folks and I mean no other guest has this much key info plus
[02:45:52.000 --> 02:45:55.000]  a lot of its articles we write you you'll notice Bob knows what the good
[02:45:55.000 --> 02:46:02.040]  stuff is it's over 45 pages sometimes even longer the point is a free year
[02:46:02.040 --> 02:46:07.760]  membership digital or hard copy from Bob Chapman when you buy one Frank and this
[02:46:07.760 --> 02:46:13.600]  comes out to $500 an ounce gold with this deal Ted throw out quickly because I
[02:46:13.600 --> 02:46:16.600]  didn't even tell Bob we were gonna do this I want to see what he's gonna say
[02:46:16.600 --> 02:46:20.600]  throw out your golden silver deals real fast and then we're gonna ask Bob how
[02:46:20.600 --> 02:46:24.040]  good a deal those are because I happen to know you can't find gold deals and
[02:46:24.040 --> 02:46:27.960]  silver deals anywhere near this anywhere you know some places do fake bait and
[02:46:27.960 --> 02:46:32.200]  switches this is real folks Ted Anderson yeah well the Frank is currently
[02:46:32.200 --> 02:46:38.320]  right now 261 61 and if you buy just the one coin you're gonna be able to get a
[02:46:38.320 --> 02:46:41.020]  full year subscription to the international forecaster just like
[02:46:41.020 --> 02:46:46.080]  Alex described now if you take the discount of that 159 off of there comes
[02:46:46.080 --> 02:46:51.000]  out to be about $520 gold and you have to turn back the clock more than 10
[02:46:51.000 --> 02:46:56.320]  years to be able to buy gold at that price we also have the Montana civil
[02:46:56.320 --> 02:47:02.080]  rounds there in 1873 that's also another great buy I know I've seen online those
[02:47:02.080 --> 02:47:08.920]  have gone over 20 bucks now and then the $20 Liberty Alex at $1363 for a $20
[02:47:08.920 --> 02:47:14.680]  Liberty which is a hundred-year-old coin you know US Eagles are over 1200 bucks
[02:47:14.680 --> 02:47:19.960]  right now and that coin is just absolutely a steal so really but what
[02:47:19.960 --> 02:47:24.640]  do you got on sovereigns Ted well sovereigns right now are at $318 also
[02:47:24.640 --> 02:47:29.280]  another really good buy but I can tell you right now I can't make a sweeter
[02:47:29.280 --> 02:47:33.720]  deal than for you to have the international forecaster and after
[02:47:33.720 --> 02:47:38.920]  calculating the discount you're buying gold at $520 an ounce Bob Chapman how
[02:47:38.920 --> 02:47:45.280]  good is that deal Ted just offered it is fantastic it does not get any better
[02:47:45.280 --> 02:47:50.320]  let me just add this to folks I really have storeable food I really have
[02:47:50.320 --> 02:47:55.040]  firearms because I read the banks you know a decade ago saying they're gonna
[02:47:55.040 --> 02:47:58.840]  get everybody in debt implode the world economy bringing a world government they
[02:47:58.840 --> 02:48:04.840]  run with planned austerity now ten years later I see it in the news with the IMF
[02:48:04.840 --> 02:48:08.560]  the World Bank the Federal Reserve the Harvard Business School head all saying
[02:48:08.560 --> 02:48:13.400]  a new way of life is here you're all gonna be slaves now but it's good for the
[02:48:13.400 --> 02:48:18.440]  earth headline bad economy good for carbon footprint I have a family to
[02:48:18.440 --> 02:48:23.600]  take care of so I've got gold I've got silver I've got food and I bought my
[02:48:23.600 --> 02:48:26.920]  gold and silver from Ted Anderson and let me tell you when gold when I bought
[02:48:26.920 --> 02:48:31.760]  for 260 bucks an ounce ten years ago went up to 500 I didn't sell it when it
[02:48:31.760 --> 02:48:35.800]  went to a thousand I didn't sell it when it went up to 1230 bucks I didn't sell
[02:48:35.800 --> 02:48:39.680]  it when it went back down to 950 I didn't sell it when it ran back up to
[02:48:39.680 --> 02:48:44.920]  1130 I didn't sell it I'm not selling it because I know they're in a concerted
[02:48:44.920 --> 02:48:50.200]  effort to devalue currencies worldwide and I will not be dependent on this
[02:48:50.200 --> 02:48:54.120]  stinking criminal government and that's the reason to get gold and silver a lot
[02:48:54.120 --> 02:48:56.960]  of you've got it for an investment you've done better than any other investment
[02:48:56.960 --> 02:49:00.240]  out there it's the best performing in the last decade period everybody knows
[02:49:00.240 --> 02:49:04.200]  that that's admitted the issue is that's not why I even have it I have it
[02:49:04.200 --> 02:49:09.360]  because it protects me Bob Chapman how important is that point it is the most
[02:49:09.360 --> 02:49:14.040]  important thing that you can do after you put in your defensive position which
[02:49:14.040 --> 02:49:19.920]  is food filter and weapons absolutely here's the number for all those different
[02:49:19.920 --> 02:49:23.440]  offers brokers will be there throughout the weekend if they're out to lunch or
[02:49:23.440 --> 02:49:26.280]  something there's usually 15 of them up there on the weekend leave her name and
[02:49:26.280 --> 02:49:29.080]  number they'll call your right back and you'll be able to get this deal because
[02:49:29.080 --> 02:49:32.680]  gold's still going up and Ted's giving you lower prices because he bought it when
[02:49:32.680 --> 02:49:36.080]  it was lower how long can you hold these deals Ted well I'm gonna hold it right
[02:49:36.080 --> 02:49:39.280]  through Sunday and then we'll see what Monday holds but yeah I can do it right

[02:55:24.280 --> 02:55:27.560]  that really is the good news though because I know your newsletter is got
[02:55:27.560 --> 02:55:32.320]  like a rocket tied to it my radio shows my websites my films that I've got
[02:55:32.320 --> 02:55:37.040]  Newsweek Time Magazine Southern Property Law Center ADL attacking me
[02:55:37.040 --> 02:55:42.760]  newspapers attack me every day is that not a good sign it certainly is and they
[02:55:42.760 --> 02:55:47.760]  don't attack me because they can't find me oh and they attack you somebody
[02:55:47.760 --> 02:55:53.560]  Incidentally you know Ted was talking about gold and you as well and its
[02:55:53.560 --> 02:55:59.080]  future and you know I had to point something up here and it's the a lot of
[02:55:59.080 --> 02:56:06.160]  people want to get into other currencies as opposed to or with being in
[02:56:06.160 --> 02:56:12.280]  gold and I want to point something out here and I'm going to give these you in
[02:56:12.280 --> 02:56:17.520]  three segments two double oh eight two double oh nine in year to date the US
[02:56:17.520 --> 02:56:25.360]  dollar in gold terms gold went up 1% against the dollar in 2008 and 2009 it
[02:56:25.360 --> 02:56:33.440]  went up 24.7% and though so far this year it's up 24.3% and the figures in the
[02:56:33.440 --> 02:56:41.000]  yen and in the euro and then the Swiss Frank and then the Rememby are similar I
[02:56:41.000 --> 02:56:46.320]  won't go into all the numbers but I don't let people know that no currency
[02:56:46.320 --> 02:56:50.800]  is going to save you you don't want to be in a currency you only want to be in
[02:56:50.800 --> 02:56:58.000]  gold and silver and that's the end of it well Bob we saw record prices for gold
[02:56:58.000 --> 02:57:02.880]  this week in Europe and it went up some in the US but not as much and the banks
[02:57:02.880 --> 02:57:07.360]  admit they are devaluing the currencies in a coordinated fashion why do they do
[02:57:07.360 --> 02:57:14.160]  that well I think the the main reason is that they know gold is going to take off
[02:57:14.160 --> 02:57:19.080]  and they're trying to soften the blow plus there's special problems in Europe
[02:57:19.080 --> 02:57:26.880]  right now pertaining to the euro and other currencies the the Danish corona and
[02:57:26.880 --> 02:57:33.400]  the Swedish corona are having very bad problems and of course the British pound
[02:57:33.400 --> 02:57:38.600]  is outside of the euro zone and they're having monstrous problems they're
[02:57:38.600 --> 02:57:45.600]  talking in terms of in England being the next Greek Greece and so this shows you
[02:57:45.600 --> 02:57:53.160]  the coordinated effort not only to diminu the value the value of these
[02:57:53.160 --> 02:57:59.600]  different currencies versus gold but the pending problem of bankruptcy they're
[02:57:59.600 --> 02:58:04.080]  evolving into it and that's why they started this whole thing in the first
[02:58:04.080 --> 02:58:08.000]  place they could have done this 10 years ago but they weren't ready now
[02:58:08.000 --> 02:58:11.640]  they're ready or they're being forced to one or the other and they go ahead with
[02:58:11.640 --> 02:58:17.360]  it and they think their police state control grid over Western Europe Eastern
[02:58:17.360 --> 02:58:21.440]  Europe the Mediterranean the United States and Asia and Latin America is
[02:58:21.440 --> 02:58:25.800]  going to be able to keep them in control they think we're like Argentina or
[02:58:25.800 --> 02:58:29.960]  Nigeria where the people aren't armed and they got away with this I don't see
[02:58:29.960 --> 02:58:33.320]  them being successful Bob stay with us just a few more minutes I want to talk
[02:58:33.320 --> 02:58:37.240]  about how you see this unfolding what's going to happen when they try to drop the
[02:58:37.240 --> 02:58:41.080]  hammer then we got Gerald Salente coming up
[02:58:41.080 --> 02:58:46.360]  America's number one stories for independent talk radio for over a
[02:58:46.360 --> 02:58:54.320]  decade we are the GCN radio network hundreds of nations have fallen to
[02:58:54.320 --> 02:58:59.600]  tyranny in the last century alone this is our last chance to not relive history
[02:58:59.600 --> 02:59:03.720]  as it finishing off this agenda that will be pulling the rug from underneath
[02:59:03.720 --> 02:59:09.400]  Americans at home tremendous influence on our president in Congress and they
[02:59:09.400 --> 02:59:14.520]  really are calling the shots I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American
[02:59:14.520 --> 02:59:18.880]  citizens to pay attention fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our
[02:59:18.880 --> 02:59:24.160]  nation the criminal offshore cartel hell bent on destroying sovereignty and on
[02:59:24.160 --> 02:59:28.440]  its ashes constructing world government Tim Geithner Bernanke the arsonists
[02:59:28.440 --> 02:59:31.960]  they're asking for more matches and the Congress is saying who do we make the
[02:59:31.960 --> 02:59:37.200]  checkout to today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we
[02:59:37.200 --> 02:59:42.880]  have seen a fall of the Republic get your copy of fall of the Republic on DVD
[02:59:42.880 --> 02:59:48.200]  at infowars.com we're watching online right now in super high quality at
[02:59:48.200 --> 02:59:51.720]  prisonplanet.tv
[02:59:53.880 --> 03:00:01.560]  waging war on corruption Alex Jones on the GCN radio network
[03:00:01.560 --> 03:00:14.800]  talking to Gerald Salente Webster Tarpoli Dr. Paul Craig Roberts Bob
[03:00:14.800 --> 03:00:21.960]  Chapman Max Kaiser we have the analyst and guest on who've been right over and
[03:00:21.960 --> 03:00:26.960]  over and over again I'd say 95% of the time and I've asked Bob and others well
[03:00:26.960 --> 03:00:31.000]  one of the most the analyst on TV and they've had articles about this get
[03:00:31.000 --> 03:00:35.160]  most of their predictions wrong and Bob and others have said well it's not that
[03:00:35.160 --> 03:00:39.400]  they're even stupid they're lying they're suckering the public they could be
[03:00:39.400 --> 03:00:42.960]  accurate they know what's going on it's like a few months ago George Soros was
[03:00:42.960 --> 03:00:46.080]  being interviewed for TV and he said well of course I know where the dollar
[03:00:46.080 --> 03:00:50.200]  and currencies are going but I'm not gonna tell you and they do know and now
[03:00:50.200 --> 03:00:53.480]  it turns out he's behind a lot of what's happening in Greece now they're
[03:00:53.480 --> 03:00:59.320]  setting it up here for the banker bailout they engage in financial terrorism
[03:00:59.320 --> 03:01:03.560]  to drive down the currencies Gerald Salente joining us via video Skype from
[03:01:03.560 --> 03:01:08.160]  New York top trends forecaster will be with us in just a moment but but
[03:01:08.160 --> 03:01:12.920]  finishing up on that point Bob Chapman of the loss of credibility the mainstream
[03:01:12.920 --> 03:01:17.400]  media to have them running around saying there's no new world order the banks
[03:01:17.400 --> 03:01:21.360]  didn't steal any money everything's fine and then separately on their own
[03:01:21.360 --> 03:01:26.000]  channels admitting world government is here I mean when I talk about mainstream
[03:01:26.000 --> 03:01:31.320]  media losing all confidence in the the public has in them they almost have a
[03:01:31.320 --> 03:01:36.840]  negative deficit now well that's right and you know if they don't do what
[03:01:36.840 --> 03:01:42.880]  they're told they don't keep their job and if they don't want to do what like
[03:01:42.880 --> 03:01:49.280]  CNBC if you don't do what they tell you to do you're out and we just saw that
[03:01:49.280 --> 03:01:54.440]  with Dylan Radigan and now he's on MSNBC and he's doing a lot of exposure
[03:01:54.440 --> 03:01:58.240]  some of the things same things that we're doing and I think that's terrific
[03:01:58.240 --> 03:02:04.040]  but generally speaking you can't tell the truth they won't allow you to and it's
[03:02:04.040 --> 03:02:08.400]  not only in the media it's everywhere look at the economists in the analysts for
[03:02:08.400 --> 03:02:12.840]  years I mean why are they wrong two-thirds of the time some of those
[03:02:12.840 --> 03:02:17.000]  brilliant people in the world only because they can't tell the truth because
[03:02:17.000 --> 03:02:21.920]  if they do they lose their job but more and more I was listening to Bloomberg
[03:02:21.920 --> 03:02:27.920]  last night this morning but Bloomberg financial on my XM Sirius and they were
[03:02:27.920 --> 03:02:31.840]  just giggling and laughing the bankers are taking over record profits ha ha ha
[03:02:31.840 --> 03:02:36.720]  the world collapsing is going to be good for us I mean you talk about Marie
[03:02:36.720 --> 03:02:41.960]  Antoinette as the people are starving outside the the Bastille and they say
[03:02:41.960 --> 03:02:46.040]  that they're starving they need bread and she said let them eat cake now it's
[03:02:46.040 --> 03:02:49.520]  been reported she didn't really say that but our modern bankers really are
[03:02:49.520 --> 03:02:55.040]  saying that and they should be reminded over and over and over again in a
[03:02:55.040 --> 03:03:00.640]  country of five million people in the late 1700s 300,000 of them lost their
[03:03:00.640 --> 03:03:09.000]  heads absolutely all the scum that serve this system is in a lot of trouble and
[03:03:09.000 --> 03:03:12.960]  none of their police state or armored vehicles are going to save them Bob
[03:03:12.960 --> 03:03:17.800]  Chapman thank you so much for spending time with us today my pleasure and I'll
[03:03:17.800 --> 03:03:21.560]  see you a little earlier next week all right take care absolutely because you're
[03:03:21.560 --> 03:03:25.840]  coming on before Jesse Ventura next Friday so Bob won't be with us in his
[03:03:25.840 --> 03:03:29.440]  normal third hour he'll be with us in the second hour next week we got Max
[03:03:29.440 --> 03:03:33.240]  Kaiser next week some congressman we're getting lined up a lot of really
[03:03:33.240 --> 03:03:38.280]  informative guests next week but I tell you I'm really excited about this next
[03:03:38.280 --> 03:03:41.680]  guest not only is he and I witness to the Chilean earthquake and we're glad he
[03:03:41.680 --> 03:03:47.120]  got out of it alive he is the top trans forecaster and three four years ago
[03:03:47.120 --> 03:03:52.200]  predicted exactly what's happening today and he got made fun of on some of the
[03:03:52.200 --> 03:03:55.640]  national TV stations when he said a lot of this but they shouldn't have been
[03:03:55.640 --> 03:03:59.440]  laughing because I've been aware of his work for more than a decade unfortunately
[03:03:59.440 --> 03:04:04.120]  almost all of it comes true because he's trends forecasting Gerald Salente for the
[03:04:04.120 --> 03:04:07.680]  balance of the hour after this quick break and we'll attempt to get to your
[03:04:07.680 --> 03:04:15.720]  calls Doug Toshia Caleb John anti-nazi and others that are calling in toll
[03:04:15.720 --> 03:04:20.600]  free number to join us 1-800-25-99231 and I'll go to your calls since you're
[03:04:20.600 --> 03:04:24.840]  holding from earlier try to ask your question in a form of a trans forecast
[03:04:24.840 --> 03:04:27.600]  because Gerald's a really smart guy he can talk about any subject he's one of
[03:04:27.600 --> 03:04:31.080]  the few guests that we can go to college from a previous hour on because he'll be
[03:04:31.080 --> 03:04:34.520]  able to comment on it wide range general knowledge of a lot of things a
[03:04:34.520 --> 03:04:39.720]  generalist rather than a specialist and that's what I tend to believe I am and
[03:04:39.720 --> 03:04:44.120]  so we'll talk to this gentleman on the other side of this break and we'll also
[03:04:44.120 --> 03:04:48.400]  give you his website and tell you how to get his very important trends journal
[03:04:48.400 --> 03:04:53.840]  that I read monthly it's as invaluable as the international forecaster with Bob
[03:04:53.840 --> 03:04:58.680]  Chapman if you want a free copy of that when you buy one Frank you can get it at
[03:04:58.680 --> 03:05:05.840]  800-686-2337 I folks this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the
[03:05:05.840 --> 03:05:10.240]  silver lungs generator now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver
[03:05:10.240 --> 03:05:14.280]  and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the
[03:05:14.280 --> 03:05:18.080]  solution through the lungs the respiratory system is the first line of
[03:05:18.080 --> 03:05:22.000]  defense for airborne pathogens and viruses the silver lungs generator
[03:05:22.000 --> 03:05:26.800]  infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano silver solutions
[03:05:26.800 --> 03:05:31.680]  and also delivers the silver nano particles instantly into the bloodstream
[03:05:31.680 --> 03:05:36.640]  with continued legislation threatening the sale of nano silver products you can
[03:05:36.640 --> 03:05:41.280]  now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the silver lungs generator
[03:05:41.280 --> 03:05:45.400]  very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided making

[03:06:00.480 --> 03:06:04.480]  this is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a
[03:06:04.480 --> 03:06:08.800]  solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily double
[03:06:08.800 --> 03:06:13.000]  or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control
[03:06:13.000 --> 03:06:17.000]  how much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total
[03:06:17.000 --> 03:06:20.880]  government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is
[03:06:20.880 --> 03:06:25.160]  coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously
[03:06:25.160 --> 03:06:29.320]  overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the
[03:06:29.320 --> 03:06:33.640]  problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every
[03:06:33.640 --> 03:06:37.360]  year thousands of families lose their power from weather-related onages number
[03:06:37.360 --> 03:06:41.520]  five a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of
[03:06:41.520 --> 03:06:44.920]  mind folks I really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions

[03:11:02.800 --> 03:11:07.240]  special offer for those that normally can't afford the trends journal right
[03:11:07.240 --> 03:11:11.440]  these are very difficult times we want people to be prepared we make it
[03:11:11.440 --> 03:11:17.120]  available to just about anyone that could afford it within their means okay
[03:11:17.120 --> 03:11:21.240]  let's let's cut to the chase here what happened in Chile you were there for the
[03:11:21.240 --> 03:11:26.040]  big massive earthquake and then let's get into what's currently happening with
[03:11:26.040 --> 03:11:31.160]  Greece and the world and the banks well it's important about Chile being that I
[03:11:31.160 --> 03:11:36.400]  escaped alive is that one of the top trends that we listed in our trends
[03:11:36.400 --> 03:11:43.440]  journal for 2010 is neo-survivalism the systems are breaking down at every
[03:11:43.440 --> 03:11:48.880]  level and people need to be aware of this because when the worst happens they
[03:11:48.880 --> 03:11:54.000]  have to be prepared you don't wait for things to happen if they do happen you
[03:11:54.000 --> 03:12:00.000]  must take the most advanced measures you can to survive physical physical
[03:12:00.000 --> 03:12:05.520]  psychological you name it and it really went into practice and what happened to
[03:12:05.520 --> 03:12:12.640]  us in Chile we got there on a Thursday night Saturday morning I was jolted out
[03:12:12.640 --> 03:12:16.920]  of bed I felt the first tremors I was with one of my colleagues who are on a
[03:12:16.920 --> 03:12:22.800]  South American tour fact-finding mission and you know knowing it was an
[03:12:22.800 --> 03:12:27.480]  earthquake zone I immediately you know just put on my pants put on my shoes
[03:12:27.480 --> 03:12:32.520]  grab my jacket by the time I grab my jacket we're on the 14th floor of the
[03:12:32.520 --> 03:12:38.400]  Crown Plaza Hotel the television when flying draws flew out of their bureaus
[03:12:38.400 --> 03:12:45.360]  chairs toppling over lamps Alex I was the first guy down 14 flights of stairs
[03:12:45.360 --> 03:12:50.600]  and what's astonishing is that there was only one other person besides my pal
[03:12:50.600 --> 03:12:55.840]  that was right behind me and that was somebody you know praying in Spanish as
[03:12:55.840 --> 03:13:00.440]  they were coming down the stairs the point being is that after the earthquake
[03:13:00.440 --> 03:13:06.200]  we as we started interviewing people most people froze either went under the
[03:13:06.200 --> 03:13:14.080]  desks they went into bathtubs hit under doorways they call the front desk they
[03:13:14.080 --> 03:13:19.920]  waited for tour operators they did not take proactive measures they didn't
[03:13:19.920 --> 03:13:24.480]  prepare for the worst and then I'm cutting through the story very quickly
[03:13:24.480 --> 03:13:29.440]  because when we finally got outside and we wanted to get away from the building
[03:13:29.440 --> 03:13:35.040]  all of a sudden you know this is 4 a.m. in Chile you know the the Ladens are
[03:13:35.040 --> 03:13:40.800]  out late at night having a good time 50 60 guys come screaming down the streets
[03:13:40.800 --> 03:13:46.000]  knocking over everybody and anything in their way and mugging them you know so
[03:13:46.000 --> 03:13:50.800]  we had to use a lot of defensive measures to stay alive and I'm mentioning
[03:13:50.800 --> 03:13:55.280]  this because these are the kind of conditions that exist today it's the
[03:13:55.280 --> 03:14:00.640]  products that you sell on your radio station it's about that solar panel it's
[03:14:00.640 --> 03:14:07.960]  about having that excess of food in the eventuality of a terrorism 2012 which is
[03:14:07.960 --> 03:14:13.560]  on the horizon it's about those food shortages it's about preparing for the
[03:14:13.560 --> 03:14:18.920]  worst if the worst doesn't happen great you were prepared but if the worst
[03:14:18.920 --> 03:14:25.680]  happens and you're not prepared guess what Jack you're dead in fact years ago
[03:14:25.680 --> 03:14:29.920]  you moved out of New York City and moved to a rural area and have been getting
[03:14:29.920 --> 03:14:34.560]  prepared and predicted the financial collapse in 2008 that you believe and
[03:14:34.560 --> 03:14:37.600]  now they're openly saying in the news will lead to total collapse in the next
[03:14:37.600 --> 03:14:42.640]  three years and again I don't think of myself as a tough guy I know you don't
[03:14:42.640 --> 03:14:49.480]  we're just regular guys but five years ago six years ago now I was in a restaurant
[03:14:49.480 --> 03:14:54.920]  of a Madeleine restaurant and I went in the bathroom my wife and son are
[03:14:54.920 --> 03:14:59.560]  outside eating in the main area and I come out everybody's screaming and
[03:14:59.560 --> 03:15:02.560]  yelling and I had to fight through people when a woman was turning purple
[03:15:02.560 --> 03:15:06.880]  choking and they got mad at me when I started doing a Heimlich saying no wait
[03:15:06.880 --> 03:15:12.600]  for 911 wait for the ambulance and they were just shouting call 911 call 911
[03:15:12.600 --> 03:15:19.920]  call 911 call 911 and I and they were and and then I this big piece of bread
[03:15:19.920 --> 03:15:22.520]  coughed out of her mouth they started thanking me but I figured I could be
[03:15:22.520 --> 03:15:27.720]  sued so I grabbed my family and fled 30 years ago half the men in there would
[03:15:27.720 --> 03:15:31.640]  have gone over to do in Heimlich it was like bizarre at first bad that I was
[03:15:31.640 --> 03:15:35.560]  gonna try to save her and then I was a hero once I did it and and it's like
[03:15:35.560 --> 03:15:39.680]  learned helplessness people just hide in their bathtubs or they call the police
[03:15:39.680 --> 03:15:43.840]  you know I hear these 911 calls where a woman calls the police when a killer is
[03:15:43.840 --> 03:15:48.600]  coming in to rape them and and and then it's bizarre to have a gun it's bizarre
[03:15:48.600 --> 03:15:52.520]  to know how to fight it's I mean I see it's like people in Nazi Germany running
[03:15:52.520 --> 03:15:56.520]  into pits to be shot or I saw the execution videos from Nigeria where they
[03:15:56.520 --> 03:15:59.960]  were killing people and directing them into the street to shoot more these guys
[03:15:59.960 --> 03:16:03.720]  could have run into an alley or got away they marched up under orders knowing
[03:16:03.720 --> 03:16:08.640]  they were gonna be killed and laid down and submitted I don't understand this
[03:16:08.640 --> 03:16:15.720]  Gerald he dropped again okay we'll try one more time and then that's it yeah
[03:16:15.720 --> 03:16:20.240]  let's do phone he didn't even hear my story there but there he is in an
[03:16:20.240 --> 03:16:23.840]  earthquake and I would imagine this is mainly Westerners in the hotel from what
[03:16:23.840 --> 03:16:29.000]  it sounds like and everyone is just submitting everyone is just groveling
[03:16:29.000 --> 03:16:35.720]  everyone is just in a catatonic fetal position but the criminals they knew when
[03:16:35.720 --> 03:16:38.840]  there was an earthquake it's time to steal within minutes they were out
[03:16:38.840 --> 03:16:42.360]  stealing and see that's the government never let a good crisis go to waste
[03:16:42.360 --> 03:16:49.280]  never let a good crisis go to waste okay okay Gerald you're back with us I was
[03:16:49.280 --> 03:16:53.880]  telling the story of a restaurant watching a woman choke and people trying
[03:16:53.880 --> 03:17:01.400]  to stop me from saving her saying call 911 yeah you know the other thing too is
[03:17:01.400 --> 03:17:06.440]  when all this violence broke out there are no police around you're on your own
[03:17:06.440 --> 03:17:11.640]  and and the other element of neo-survivalism is to belong to a group
[03:17:11.640 --> 03:17:16.760]  you know like-minded people start talking and thinking about this now I'm a
[03:17:16.760 --> 03:17:23.120]  close combat martial artist we contacted our a master John Perkins at a top
[03:17:23.120 --> 03:17:30.520]  attackproof.com and he sent out a global SOS within side of the hours we had
[03:17:30.520 --> 03:17:35.360]  direct connections to the embassy there were people in Chile and Argentina
[03:17:35.360 --> 03:17:41.560]  offering lodging and funds and one person contacted us and gave us an
[03:17:41.560 --> 03:17:47.320]  escape route and strategy to get to Mendoza Argentina and so it's those
[03:17:47.320 --> 03:17:53.160]  kind of things having a network of people that you could rely on because we
[03:17:53.160 --> 03:17:59.080]  only were able to go so far and then the others helped us go further so again
[03:17:59.080 --> 03:18:03.240]  it's about having your own community and you're part of a community that's all
[03:18:03.240 --> 03:18:09.480]  over the world and it was invaluable exactly well I wouldn't be here today I
[03:18:09.480 --> 03:18:13.240]  would still be stuck over there the airport was down the roads were
[03:18:13.240 --> 03:18:18.240]  destroyed you know so we had to use another strategy and it's that community
[03:18:18.240 --> 03:18:23.120]  and by the way all things are connected you know it goes back to the economy how
[03:18:23.120 --> 03:18:27.720]  are we going to have a strong economy well guess what you know I'm a believer
[03:18:27.720 --> 03:18:32.800]  in the golden rule those who have the gold rule and if we're gonna send all
[03:18:32.800 --> 03:18:38.840]  our money to China guess who's going to rule us if we start doing business with
[03:18:38.840 --> 03:18:44.920]  each other start being a community of Americans again guess what we'll survive
[03:18:44.920 --> 03:18:50.400]  and thrive it's all connected well I mean what do you call this learned
[03:18:50.400 --> 03:18:54.800]  helplessness because 50 years ago if a woman was choking most people would go
[03:18:54.800 --> 03:18:59.560]  over to a Heimlich 50 years ago I would imagine Westerners in that hotel would
[03:18:59.560 --> 03:19:04.360]  have gotten up and got out why do people wait for someone else to save them well
[03:19:04.360 --> 03:19:09.160]  you know you I heard the end of the story a similar story happened to me up
[03:19:09.160 --> 03:19:15.640]  in the Hudson New York I saw a guy that was started to choke his daughter didn't
[03:19:15.640 --> 03:19:21.120]  know what to do they yelled out for a doctor nobody knew what to do a woman
[03:19:21.120 --> 03:19:25.560]  went behind the guy I didn't know how to do the Heimlich maneuver and I saw her
[03:19:25.560 --> 03:19:30.440]  do it and I see I saw that she wasn't strong enough and she wasn't doing it
[03:19:30.440 --> 03:19:35.760]  you know I knowing how the body works a bit and I just moved her aside gently and
[03:19:35.760 --> 03:19:44.400]  I I started doing it on him and all of a sudden we're now gonna switch to phone
[03:19:44.400 --> 03:19:49.320]  it's okay go ahead and hand him the phone we had the phone as a backup but
[03:19:49.320 --> 03:19:55.840]  but the bigger issue was that I had to start I said I'll do the Heimlich you
[03:19:55.840 --> 03:19:58.800]  know because I had that in swim team like the half day course I didn't have
[03:19:58.800 --> 03:20:03.080]  the full certification but I put my hands under you know her rib cage right
[03:20:03.080 --> 03:20:06.880]  there in the bread basket and couple of heaves and a big piece of bread came out
[03:20:06.880 --> 03:20:15.440]  do we have Gerald back now okay well luckily we got 40 more minutes here and
[03:20:15.440 --> 03:20:18.720]  I skipped this break so we'll pick up the time we've lost here because I want to
[03:20:18.720 --> 03:20:25.160]  get into his trends and where he sees the economy is going with with Gerald
[03:20:25.160 --> 03:20:33.400]  Salente but again ladies and gentlemen it is not heroic to save someone who's
[03:20:33.400 --> 03:20:39.200]  choking you she would have died if it I mean she was turning blue I just been in
[03:20:39.200 --> 03:20:44.200]  the bathroom two minutes when I came out if no one would have called if no one
[03:20:44.200 --> 03:20:46.760]  would have helped her and just called the police and waited for them to get
[03:20:46.760 --> 03:20:51.120]  there in five minutes she would have choked I mean it's just chanting like
[03:20:51.120 --> 03:21:05.000]  parrots call 9-1-1 call 9-1-1 call 9-1-1 and that's what our society has turned
[03:21:05.000 --> 03:21:10.080]  into is just totally domesticated people alright Gerald Salente we got
[03:21:10.080 --> 03:21:14.360]  plenty of time I skipped that break threes the charm you're back with us so
[03:21:14.360 --> 03:21:19.040]  you you start doing the Heimlich on the person go ahead yeah and then you know
[03:21:19.040 --> 03:21:23.440]  the all of a sudden you know food came flying out of his mouth you know he was
[03:21:23.440 --> 03:21:28.640]  choking to death he was nearly blue and then we found out there was a doctor in
[03:21:28.640 --> 03:21:33.720]  the house the doctor was afraid to get involved and that's what's going on more
[03:21:33.720 --> 03:21:37.880]  and more people are afraid to get involved they're afraid to speak up
[03:21:37.880 --> 03:21:43.200]  they're afraid to regain their dignity and respect and that's why people are
[03:21:43.200 --> 03:21:49.160]  following their leaders when it we're in these times of survival people should
[03:21:49.160 --> 03:21:55.440]  be in survival mode and they're not doing it they still believe in hope and
[03:21:55.440 --> 03:22:01.280]  change and they'll make a million excuses as to why they're not doing what
[03:22:01.280 --> 03:22:05.160]  they should be doing it's like the lottery tickets syndrome instead of
[03:22:05.160 --> 03:22:09.120]  going out and getting an extra job or you know becoming an entrepreneur people
[03:22:09.120 --> 03:22:12.440]  really think they're gonna get a lottery ticket and that's gonna save them it's
[03:22:12.440 --> 03:22:18.840]  that it's that perceived hope exactly and and again you know they're
[03:22:18.840 --> 03:22:24.280]  buffaloing the people I was listening to Bob Chapman and and yourself about the
[03:22:24.280 --> 03:22:29.780]  moronic media that we have that keeps telling people everything's okay they
[03:22:29.780 --> 03:22:34.520]  keep rolling out these Wall Street shills that are selling things and
[03:22:34.520 --> 03:22:39.920]  telling people to invest I mean you have to be out of your mind I believe to put
[03:22:39.920 --> 03:22:45.560]  a penny into the equity markets what what imbecile doesn't see what's going
[03:22:45.560 --> 03:22:55.000]  on black pools high-frequency trading insider trading made-off sin whip off
[03:22:55.000 --> 03:23:01.000]  any any rookie out there that thinks that they have a shot in this game is
[03:23:01.000 --> 03:23:07.200]  like the person that's playing the lottery thinking if you're in it you
[03:23:07.200 --> 03:23:12.240]  could win it the only group winning is the casino
[03:23:12.240 --> 03:23:18.280]  Gerald Salente I want to now in the time we've got with you break down the
[03:23:18.280 --> 03:23:22.760]  trends you've been right about the economy spot on where it's going what
[03:23:22.760 --> 03:23:26.680]  the big predatory banks are doing I want to talk about where the economy is
[03:23:26.680 --> 03:23:31.440]  going your trends the resistance by the people more and more riots worldwide you
[03:23:31.440 --> 03:23:35.840]  predicted three years ago more and more you know big violent demonstrations in
[03:23:35.840 --> 03:23:41.760]  California yesterday more people lose everything they lose it as you say
[03:23:41.760 --> 03:23:46.040]  shootings going on people flying airplanes into buildings whether it
[03:23:46.040 --> 03:23:52.160]  staged or not stuff is starting to get crazy you know I've narrowed it down to
[03:23:52.160 --> 03:24:02.000]  six simple words Princeton Harvard Yale bullets bombs and banks it's all it's
[03:24:02.000 --> 03:24:10.480]  about say that again Princeton Harvard Yale bullets bombs and banks that's the
[03:24:10.480 --> 03:24:17.120]  whole game wrapped up in six simple words and they're robbing us blind and
[03:24:17.120 --> 03:24:22.840]  they're sending us to our death and you just look at the history going back to
[03:24:22.840 --> 03:24:27.480]  Woodrow Wilson that president of Princeton who put us into the Great
[03:24:27.480 --> 03:24:33.800]  War that every historian worth a nickel nose was the most unnecessary war of
[03:24:33.800 --> 03:24:39.160]  the 20th century to the wars following from the Yale Clinton group the
[03:24:39.160 --> 03:24:45.160]  McNamara group the you know the Ivy League boys the elites and they're
[03:24:45.160 --> 03:24:48.760]  running the country they're running the world they're running the banks they're
[03:24:48.760 --> 03:24:54.240]  running the military and so what what's going on now is they're just trying to
[03:24:54.240 --> 03:24:59.360]  keep this game afloat and it's a worldwide game they were jumping in
[03:24:59.360 --> 03:25:09.640]  stimulus money from China to India to the Australia UK South Korea Japan US you
[03:25:09.640 --> 03:25:15.720]  name the country all they're doing is printing fiat money to keep the Ponzi
[03:25:15.720 --> 03:25:22.400]  scheme going excuse me Ponzi was a piker let's call it a made-off scheme to keep
[03:25:22.400 --> 03:25:27.800]  it going so the people that think that there's going to be a recovery are
[03:25:27.800 --> 03:25:33.320]  going to be work they're going to be thrown out into the streets the real
[03:25:33.320 --> 03:25:38.520]  estate market is not recovering the unemployment numbers came out today
[03:25:38.520 --> 03:25:43.920]  they're applauding that they weren't as high as they believe they were going to
[03:25:43.920 --> 03:25:50.720]  be or predicted they were going to be we have to create 1.5 million jobs a year
[03:25:50.720 --> 03:25:57.120]  just to stay even and they're jumping up like train seals clapping their hands
[03:25:57.120 --> 03:26:02.800]  saying it wasn't as bad as they thought it was jobs are not being created
[03:26:02.800 --> 03:26:10.440]  they're being lost we're going to see the crash of 2010 Greece is the canary in
[03:26:10.440 --> 03:26:16.760]  the economic mine shaft and they're only the small player in it everyone's
[03:26:16.760 --> 03:26:23.840]  yelling about Greece Greece all the GDP is 13% excuse me the budget deficit is
[03:26:23.840 --> 03:26:30.800]  13% of their GDP it's only supposed to be 3% according to the European Monetary
[03:26:30.800 --> 03:26:37.920]  Union hey what is it in England oh about 13% a budget deficit to GDP and what
[03:26:37.920 --> 03:26:44.920]  is it in the United States oh about 11% of budget deficit to GDP this is a
[03:26:44.920 --> 03:26:52.040]  global sovereign debt crisis that's not going to end and our greatest fear Alex
[03:26:52.040 --> 03:27:03.360]  is when all else fails Princeton Harvard Yale bullets bombs and banks absolutely
[03:27:03.360 --> 03:27:08.440]  what's the word on war from your research it looks like an Iran attack is
[03:27:08.440 --> 03:27:13.080]  moving towards the front burner again pushing it out there and pushing it
[03:27:13.080 --> 03:27:19.600]  out there and we've said this over and over again if anybody invades Iran it's
[03:27:19.600 --> 03:27:25.920]  the beginning of World War three these are the Persians like them or not
[03:27:25.920 --> 03:27:32.880]  whatever your agenda ideology is put it on the shelf folks the Iranians for the
[03:27:32.880 --> 03:27:38.640]  Iraqis for eight years you remember Donald Rumsfeld giving Saddam Hussein
[03:27:38.640 --> 03:27:45.840]  those golden spurs to keep writing that war further and further into Iran that
[03:27:45.840 --> 03:27:51.640]  that the United States was a proxy in well the Iranians didn't give up one
[03:27:51.640 --> 03:27:58.200]  inch of territory lost nearly a million people and they're not going to go down
[03:27:58.200 --> 03:28:03.880]  if Israel or the United States attacks and now they've got 20 times the weapons
[03:28:03.880 --> 03:28:17.840]  that they did before unbelievable about another blow-up in the Middle East with
[03:28:17.840 --> 03:28:24.720]  them with Israel and the Palestinians there is no peace plan they the the
[03:28:24.720 --> 03:28:31.240]  conditions are worsening in the occupied territories the Israelis are
[03:28:31.240 --> 03:28:36.080]  continuing to take more and more settlement property the settlement
[03:28:36.080 --> 03:28:41.080]  property Palestinian property and now there's talk about demolishing more
[03:28:41.080 --> 03:28:46.840]  homes there is no freeze on a on on settlements so we're concerned also
[03:28:46.840 --> 03:28:51.960]  that something might happen there that will spill over into Lebanon even
[03:28:51.960 --> 03:28:55.880]  possibly Syria and spread throughout the Middle East these are all
[03:28:55.880 --> 03:29:05.960]  probabilities that are growing concerns shifting gears to domestically taxes on
[03:29:05.960 --> 03:29:11.400]  food multiple states every week are passing laws it's come out in New

[03:33:12.760 --> 03:33:15.640]  Christmas Day was staged to sell the naked body scanners they'd already
[03:33:15.640 --> 03:33:19.160]  ordered the witnesses all said the government let him on the plane there
[03:33:19.160 --> 03:33:23.120]  was an argument he had no ID turns out the state department was ordered by the
[03:33:23.120 --> 03:33:27.600]  CIA to let him on that was in mainstream five newspapers the state
[03:33:27.600 --> 03:33:31.840]  department admitted it but it got no attention the stack thing is very
[03:33:31.840 --> 03:33:37.280]  suspicious we've now discovered for two years the ford hood shooter was
[03:33:37.280 --> 03:33:41.720]  protected thought he was talking to al-qaeda the operative he was talking
[03:33:41.720 --> 03:33:46.840]  to is the guy that always runs patsy's so some of these are useful idiots in
[03:33:46.840 --> 03:33:52.120]  every case their parents warned them or family warned associated press parents
[03:33:52.120 --> 03:33:56.160]  of Pentagon shooter warned authorities and this guy looks like a complete
[03:33:56.160 --> 03:34:04.600]  psycho headlines 9-11 truth or shoots cops they're saying I mean folks here's
[03:34:04.600 --> 03:34:07.720]  the Watson's newest article Pentagon shooting now everyone's a terrorist I'm
[03:34:07.720 --> 03:34:11.400]  gonna ask Gerald Salenta about staged events get his take on that coming up
[03:34:11.400 --> 03:34:14.640]  but Gerald the last question and then I just want you to run through other
[03:34:14.640 --> 03:34:18.840]  predictions and pick your genius brain here because I mean folks I only give
[03:34:18.840 --> 03:34:23.200]  credit where it's due he really this guy's top trends forecaster and in
[03:34:23.200 --> 03:34:28.880]  Bob's great as well at the economics but a generalist here with Gerald Salenta
[03:34:28.880 --> 03:34:34.240]  just researches constantly it seems like they're they're pushing us towards a
[03:34:34.240 --> 03:34:38.080]  rebellion or is it just they don't care they're all busy stealing so they don't
[03:34:38.080 --> 03:34:42.160]  care if they raise hundreds of new taxes and just bankrupt everyone I mean where
[03:34:42.160 --> 03:34:47.040]  is that going well they don't care look at the lies that they live you know one
[03:34:47.040 --> 03:34:51.760]  of the I began my career I had a graduate school right I was involved with
[03:34:51.760 --> 03:34:56.400]  the mayor of campaign in Yonkers New York and then in Westchester politics as a
[03:34:56.400 --> 03:35:01.920]  campaign strategist and then they they sent me up to Albany you know all he's
[03:35:01.920 --> 03:35:05.520]  making the news now and I was the assistant to the secretary of the New
[03:35:05.520 --> 03:35:10.360]  York State Senate Alex it was the worst job ever out of my life and I had to
[03:35:10.360 --> 03:35:16.320]  lousy jobs the young guy as many of us did and what it would be is I'd be
[03:35:16.320 --> 03:35:20.160]  standing in the back of the chambers with my pal chit chatting about this or
[03:35:20.160 --> 03:35:25.480]  that the young guy in my 20s and all of a sudden a senator would walk in and my
[03:35:25.480 --> 03:35:30.680]  power would follow the senator like a little puppy dog and help pull out the
[03:35:30.680 --> 03:35:35.360]  chair to help him sit down and my friend would come back and I say hey what's the
[03:35:35.360 --> 03:35:40.760]  matter the cat can't sit down by himself he needs some help the point being all
[03:35:40.760 --> 03:35:47.600]  it was was watching grown men gravel and the way these politicians live yeah
[03:35:47.600 --> 03:35:51.760]  there's gonna be off with your heads because these are the kings and the
[03:35:51.760 --> 03:35:58.800]  queens and the noblemen of the 21st century they don't have a clue on how
[03:35:58.800 --> 03:36:05.320]  the rest of the people live they're so far removed from it look at the arrogance
[03:36:05.320 --> 03:36:11.320]  did you see that Charlie wrangle try to wrangle his way out of being a high
[03:36:11.320 --> 03:36:18.760]  pressure high power thief on TV who would believe this stuff listen Alex I
[03:36:18.760 --> 03:36:23.640]  grew up in the Bronx I used to go to Coney Island and Power Sades amusement
[03:36:23.640 --> 03:36:30.240]  park I know what a freak show looks like it's a freak show and that's who these
[03:36:30.240 --> 03:36:36.960]  people are they have no concern about any of us the only thing they're concerned
[03:36:36.960 --> 03:36:42.960]  about is maintaining their power and stealing as much as they can and this is
[03:36:42.960 --> 03:36:49.760]  another important note politicians get paid off very cheaply they don't doesn't
[03:36:49.760 --> 03:36:54.720]  take a lot to buy these guys out all they're doing is looking for the safe bet
[03:36:54.720 --> 03:37:00.240]  and a cushy wife will never have to work again in their lives or get their
[03:37:00.240 --> 03:37:07.840]  fingernails dirty absolutely now again three years ago I was reading the
[03:37:07.840 --> 03:37:12.680]  journal and you were talking about rebellions tax rebellions is the term
[03:37:12.680 --> 03:37:18.320]  you specifically used and that's the main basis of the Tea Party that's by
[03:37:18.320 --> 03:37:22.200]  partisan the Republicans have tried to take it over but that's not really being
[03:37:22.200 --> 03:37:27.440]  successful now Obama created separately the coffee party to love and worship the
[03:37:27.440 --> 03:37:31.200]  government turns out he's covertly running that so they're trying to take
[03:37:31.200 --> 03:37:37.240]  these over but I don't see that working so so now going forward how do you see
[03:37:37.240 --> 03:37:40.800]  the rebellions against government peacefully unfolding and do you see
[03:37:40.800 --> 03:37:50.680]  people violently lashing out it's up in the air because you were mentioning before about these full flags and stage events we don't
[03:37:50.680 --> 03:37:57.120]  remember the main to the Gulf of Tonkin incident that never happened so who knows
[03:37:57.120 --> 03:38:02.080]  what else so they can use something to rally the people around the government
[03:38:02.080 --> 03:38:08.600]  again I you know on my way down to Buenos Aires like I took my journal that I
[03:38:08.600 --> 03:38:14.720]  write in every day that I began writing right that I that I had written when
[03:38:14.720 --> 03:38:23.600]  9-11 happened and the quotes in there are amazing to relive you know 90 92% of
[03:38:23.600 --> 03:38:32.280]  the people were in favor of the United States bombing Afghanistan days after
[03:38:32.280 --> 03:38:39.680]  days after 9-11 Tony Blair came to the United States and my note was he can
[03:38:39.680 --> 03:38:47.160]  he's continually hitting on Iraq and then the same day that he's there the three
[03:38:47.160 --> 03:38:56.520]  days following the United States and the UK were carpet bombing Iraq so you look
[03:38:56.520 --> 03:39:03.080]  back at this you saw how unpopular Bush was before 9-11 and then you see his
[03:39:03.080 --> 03:39:10.000]  popularity mushrooming after that the same kind of thing can happen now one
[03:39:10.000 --> 03:39:14.760]  of the areas of war that I didn't mention that we're most concerned with as
[03:39:14.760 --> 03:39:20.640]  well is what's going on in Pakistan the United States is fighting a proxy war
[03:39:20.640 --> 03:39:28.520]  there using the Pakistani army the Obama this great Nobel Peace Prize winner I
[03:39:28.520 --> 03:39:34.920]  guess Norway is all well-stove backwards he has been sending more
[03:39:34.920 --> 03:39:42.640]  predator drones as you well know into Pakistan three times as many then Bush
[03:39:42.640 --> 03:39:50.120]  did during his last year in office thousands of innocent people are being
[03:39:50.120 --> 03:39:59.680]  killed there are over 200,000 Pakistanis living in the United States now with
[03:39:59.680 --> 03:40:04.840]  weapons of mass destruction available with the black market being wide open
[03:40:04.840 --> 03:40:11.040]  with the availability of biological warfare you don't need to be a member
[03:40:11.040 --> 03:40:17.280]  of an organized terrorist group you could just have maybe let's call it as
[03:40:17.280 --> 03:40:24.160]  old as the Old Testament an eye for an eye suppose your family is from South
[03:40:24.160 --> 03:40:31.360]  Waziristan or North Waziristan or the Swat Valley and a victim of Americans
[03:40:31.360 --> 03:40:37.480]  war you think you want to get even big time those are the kind of things
[03:40:37.480 --> 03:40:42.800]  we're looking for the United States will then use that as they have used it
[03:40:42.800 --> 03:40:50.160]  before to then rape us of our rights cramp down water on us and all of those
[03:40:50.160 --> 03:40:57.400]  sheeple that are looking for leaders will fall in line and follow the government
[03:40:57.400 --> 03:41:02.040]  wherever it takes them those are the concerns we have that will derail the
[03:41:02.040 --> 03:41:07.320]  revolution absolutely Gerald Salante because in many cases they don't have
[03:41:07.320 --> 03:41:11.280]  a stage a classic false flag if they attack a country they're gonna be real
[03:41:11.280 --> 03:41:15.520]  people to come after him you talk about World War one Germany was clearly the
[03:41:15.520 --> 03:41:20.440]  one that was set up in that then directly out of World War one came Adolf
[03:41:20.440 --> 03:41:24.640]  Hitler who was a really bad guy and did do horrible things and it now has been
[03:41:24.640 --> 03:41:30.480]  declassified that the British were so smart that in the 1920s Lord Milner's
[03:41:30.480 --> 03:41:34.120]  group and others said we're gonna pressure Germany they're gonna get a
[03:41:34.120 --> 03:41:39.120]  corrupt war leader and we'll fund them and then we'll destroy Europe again I
[03:41:39.120 --> 03:41:44.120]  mean these guys these guys are smart
[03:41:44.120 --> 03:41:48.680]  I wouldn't I wouldn't use the word smart I would say they're shrewd their
[03:41:48.680 --> 03:41:54.160]  sociopaths they're sick people and that's the only kind of people that do
[03:41:54.160 --> 03:41:59.040]  these things look what's going on now you mentioned Germany all of a sudden I
[03:41:59.040 --> 03:42:03.720]  mean what if people forget World War two now Germany sending more troops into
[03:42:03.720 --> 03:42:08.640]  Afghanistan what's going on and Germany openly runs the EU and it's now the
[03:42:08.640 --> 03:42:12.240]  third biggest arms producer in the world just like they secretly re-armed
[03:42:12.240 --> 03:42:16.520]  before World War two and they're calling the shots in the EU on Greece and
[03:42:16.520 --> 03:42:21.440]  everything else exactly and what about how it was everybody
[03:42:21.440 --> 03:42:27.120]  attention deficit disorder is World War two we're talking about it wasn't that
[03:42:27.120 --> 03:42:33.320]  long ago and now the Germans are now they're marching in Afghanistan where
[03:42:33.320 --> 03:42:39.440]  they march to next well we know the British are Germanic and they're
[03:42:39.440 --> 03:42:43.800]  always setting up world empires and when Germany started rising the British
[03:42:43.800 --> 03:42:47.600]  started World War one with them and it's a fact the British want to rule the
[03:42:47.600 --> 03:42:51.280]  world the government does and the Germans do and it's come out in the club of
[03:42:51.280 --> 03:42:55.320]  Rome documents it's come out in their treaties in Bilderberg that now it's
[03:42:55.320 --> 03:43:00.640]  eat global EU takeover through the banking system and this new Bank of the
[03:43:00.640 --> 03:43:04.360]  World Gordon Brown others are talking about they admit we're bankrupting the
[03:43:04.360 --> 03:43:08.560]  planet then we're gonna offer you the solution of the banks based in Europe
[03:43:08.560 --> 03:43:12.760]  running the planet and they're saying they have a democratic leader of the
[03:43:12.760 --> 03:43:16.720]  Senate say two days ago get ready for what's happening in Greece here and
[03:43:16.720 --> 03:43:20.840]  we've got to give our infrastructure to the banks so just like we're a third
[03:43:20.840 --> 03:43:24.400]  world country they're talking about taking our islands like they're doing
[03:43:24.400 --> 03:43:29.080]  Greece right now I mean will the people put up with this can homeland security
[03:43:29.080 --> 03:43:33.520]  keep enough of a clamp down on people to get away with this I don't think
[03:43:33.520 --> 03:43:38.920]  homeland security can do it but what they will do is they'll use the police
[03:43:38.920 --> 03:43:45.440]  state tactics that they did for example at the G20 meeting in Pittsburgh where
[03:43:45.440 --> 03:43:50.280]  they called basically martial law you know which is of course against the
[03:43:50.280 --> 03:43:55.480]  the Constitution but look at those photos of what happened you know you had
[03:43:55.480 --> 03:44:02.200]  these these red you had the more police they're dressed up with enough body armor
[03:44:02.200 --> 03:44:08.360]  to walk through the battle the bulge on scale wielding their batons beating up
[03:44:08.360 --> 03:44:14.400]  co-wrestling you know so that's what we're concerned about is that the the
[03:44:14.400 --> 03:44:20.440]  government will then use the local police as their enforcers well they are
[03:44:20.440 --> 03:44:25.240]  federalizing them and the videos were they would selectively anywhere in the
[03:44:25.240 --> 03:44:28.960]  city you couldn't be out there night and video on YouTube of women coming out of
[03:44:28.960 --> 03:44:33.280]  a shop old women with bags and the officer screaming pointing a billy club
[03:44:33.280 --> 03:44:37.000]  and they start saying well okay and then they let a police dog bite them and
[03:44:37.000 --> 03:44:41.040]  then no one was resisting them so they went to the university at night with the
[03:44:41.040 --> 03:44:45.000]  kids in the park you know eating food and drinking beer and said disperse and
[03:44:45.000 --> 03:44:51.160]  it wasn't even a protest and I'm I had P I had a cameraman arrested and and they
[03:44:51.160 --> 03:44:55.480]  took him to the pen they were torturing the we are change people in the pen at
[03:44:55.480 --> 03:45:01.640]  an at the U.S. Army was the U.S. Army called in terror reports on the info
[03:45:01.640 --> 03:45:06.400]  wars team and said we that we tried to attack the army base and then the police
[03:45:06.400 --> 03:45:14.560]  came after him I mean it's it's just and the police enjoyed it Gerald it's like
[03:45:14.560 --> 03:45:19.280]  a spirit of evil has come upon them or something well this is what happens in
[03:45:19.280 --> 03:45:25.000]  this kind of a climate of fear and and they're going to keep pumping it more
[03:45:25.000 --> 03:45:31.800]  and more unfortunately again there's the other other side too this could go many
[03:45:31.800 --> 03:45:38.640]  different ways because the the average the people are now starting to understand
[03:45:38.640 --> 03:45:45.560]  that the laws and justice you know one of my colleagues came up with the word
[03:45:45.560 --> 03:45:50.080]  justice we're talking about it it's only the crap down of the little people
[03:45:50.080 --> 03:45:58.480]  and he said yeah just us that's what justice is just us it's only the little
[03:45:58.480 --> 03:46:04.360]  people that they rough up you could you imagine how about roughing up rumsfeld
[03:46:04.360 --> 03:46:11.120]  how about roughing up Cheney a road how about roughing up a manual oh no no
[03:46:11.120 --> 03:46:17.480]  they always get the sweet deal like this other sociopath we have over here in
[03:46:17.480 --> 03:46:22.920]  New York this Elliott Spitzer remember him the former governor that used to
[03:46:22.920 --> 03:46:29.480]  bust John's and put and pass the law to put John's in jail and he gets caught
[03:46:29.480 --> 03:46:35.640]  with a hooker in Washington and what do they do they let him off they let all the
[03:46:35.640 --> 03:46:42.720]  big guys off it's just us that's the only ones that they're after and they're
[03:46:42.720 --> 03:46:49.160]  using the military powers they're using the police enforcement to crack down on
[03:46:49.160 --> 03:46:57.440]  the little people to keep them in line like they do in all third-world countries
[03:46:57.440 --> 03:47:03.120]  and America's gone from the most egalitarian nation on earth and this
[03:47:03.120 --> 03:47:09.800]  is a fact to the nation now of the the developed nations with a gap between the
[03:47:09.800 --> 03:47:16.800]  rich and the poor is the widest in the US of any of the major countries of the
[03:47:16.800 --> 03:47:25.040]  world so that's why we have what we have it's third-world military behavior
[03:47:25.040 --> 03:47:30.840]  because our public became third-world and very submissive to authority and
[03:47:30.840 --> 03:47:35.880]  tyranny and we lost our spirit of 1776 but it's being rekindled and the last
[03:47:35.880 --> 03:47:40.520]  14 years I read ran corporation documents I saw the preparations I saw
[03:47:40.520 --> 03:47:45.720]  the third-world type police force and it's all premeditated the bankers have
[03:47:45.720 --> 03:47:51.120]  the whole thing set up it's totally criminal and good Americans don't deserve
[03:47:51.120 --> 03:47:56.440]  this but a lot of the slack-jawed lazy yuppies do deserve what's gonna happen
[03:47:56.440 --> 03:48:00.440]  to them and the cops out there they're gonna take your pension fund too so I
[03:48:00.440 --> 03:48:03.200]  don't think you're immune from this I know a lot of police are upset about
[03:48:03.200 --> 03:48:08.360]  what's happening but at the top you got about a bunch of rotten scum promoting
[03:48:08.360 --> 03:48:12.040]  all the other scum up and kicking the good people out of government let's
[03:48:12.040 --> 03:48:15.000]  take a quick call from Doug in Oregon you're on the air with Gerald Salente

[03:49:19.400 --> 03:49:24.240]  thing and this is the perfect story of it this is why people have to act as a

[03:53:59.760 --> 03:54:02.960]  5633
[03:54:04.080 --> 03:54:10.720]  final segment I'll be back Sunday live 4 to 6 p.m. Central 5 to 7 Eastern Tasha in
[03:54:10.720 --> 03:54:17.000]  Canada you're on the air we're Gerald Salente go ahead hi there so here I am
[03:54:17.000 --> 03:54:22.120]  in Toronto Canada and there's two things that sort of concern me there's Bill C
[03:54:22.120 --> 03:54:27.720]  47 which regards is regarding the internet and it basically says they're
[03:54:27.720 --> 03:54:33.000]  going to intercept all your internet transmission decrypted and give it to
[03:54:33.000 --> 03:54:39.560]  any law enforcement agencies other organization yeah with no more simultaneously
[03:54:39.560 --> 03:54:43.920]  worldwide they are openly saying they're going to take over and start shutting
[03:54:43.920 --> 03:54:48.160]  down freedom on the internet go ahead and they also said they're going to give
[03:54:48.160 --> 03:54:51.920]  it to foreign government and I think that yes certainly a bit more than a
[03:54:51.920 --> 03:54:56.440]  house Gerald let's get a quick comment from him in your second question why are
[03:54:56.440 --> 03:55:00.840]  they openly coming after freedom on the internet because the internet is the
[03:55:00.840 --> 03:55:05.720]  freedom of the people and they want to shut that down you see they control the
[03:55:05.720 --> 03:55:11.000]  networks as we all know and now with the internet becoming the communications
[03:55:11.000 --> 03:55:15.520]  vehicle the world they're concerned that they're going to lose control and
[03:55:15.520 --> 03:55:19.960]  that's why they're taking it over and they won't stop Tasha what was your
[03:55:19.960 --> 03:55:24.920]  other question okay the other thing I want to mention was here in Toronto
[03:55:24.920 --> 03:55:29.800]  less than a week ago they installed cameras and all the buses and street
[03:55:29.800 --> 03:55:34.480]  cars and I didn't see any signs we just walked in like oh yeah they're building
[03:55:34.480 --> 03:55:37.640]  they're building a giant prison and I appreciate your call so we've got to cut
[03:55:37.640 --> 03:55:42.480]  you short look they set all this up beforehand they're openly saying this
[03:55:42.480 --> 03:55:47.120]  is in Wired magazine the end of the open internet that's the headline and some
[03:55:47.120 --> 03:55:50.720]  listeners think we're exaggerating this isn't a joke is it Gerald
[03:55:50.720 --> 03:55:56.440]  no it's not because again the internet was our freedom that's what's changing
[03:55:56.440 --> 03:56:04.120]  the whole game and the only reason why we're subjected to what we are is
[03:56:04.120 --> 03:56:09.560]  because in order to broadcast on a network as you well know it takes
[03:56:09.560 --> 03:56:14.920]  hundreds of millions of dollars but for the internet you know with a small
[03:56:14.920 --> 03:56:22.520]  budget you're a global voice you can't do that and have freedom and you can't
[03:56:22.520 --> 03:56:26.760]  and so they don't want the freedom and they're going to cut it down they're
[03:56:26.760 --> 03:56:31.920]  going to take over it unless it's stopped which is highly unlikely as we see it
[03:56:31.920 --> 03:56:36.840]  at this point and the alternative media you know yeah I mean literally info
[03:56:36.840 --> 03:56:40.880]  wars.com prison planet.com get more traffic than Rush Limbaugh and
[03:56:40.880 --> 03:56:44.760]  Glenn Beck combined just one of my sites and I'm just one of many people because
[03:56:44.760 --> 03:56:48.080]  if you tell the truth you get a giant audience the mainstream media is dying
[03:56:48.080 --> 03:56:52.520]  so they're going along with the shutdown of freedom on the web because we're
[03:56:52.520 --> 03:57:02.520]  going to overthrow them peacefully if they don't. People better appreciate the
[03:57:02.520 --> 03:57:05.600]  internet while they're still able to use it free and open shouldn't they Gerald?
[03:57:05.600 --> 03:57:11.160]  Yes they should and people better to become active in any way they can. Speak up, stand out.
[03:57:11.160 --> 03:57:18.600]  You know I have a vision of heaven and hell. To me hell is taking those last
[03:57:18.600 --> 03:57:24.800]  breaths and knowing that you weren't the person who you said or claimed you
[03:57:24.800 --> 03:57:32.160]  thought you were and people better die in dignity because to me it's hell if
[03:57:32.160 --> 03:57:40.360]  you don't and now is the choice to live or die to know that you were the
[03:57:40.360 --> 03:57:47.960]  person that you claim to be. Talk is cheap, it takes guts, it takes stamina and
[03:57:47.960 --> 03:57:54.040]  dignity and respect to be the person that you need to be and people need to
[03:57:54.040 --> 03:58:01.400]  shape up physically, spiritually, emotionally in order for this country to
[03:58:01.400 --> 03:58:06.880]  regain its greatness and I've given the formula before it's very simple and it's
[03:58:06.880 --> 03:58:11.880]  only a fact. We were the greatest nation on earth. When it wasn't about Wall Street
[03:58:11.880 --> 03:58:17.680]  we had strong main street. It wasn't about Walmart, it was about mom and pop and
[03:58:17.680 --> 03:58:22.680]  it wasn't about factory farms, it was family farms. We need to support each
[03:58:22.680 --> 03:58:27.720]  other. Absolutely Gerald Solente. The big challenge is here. The globalists have
[03:58:27.720 --> 03:58:31.240]  set up a scientific dictatorship and are moving against us but thanks to you and
[03:58:31.240 --> 03:58:34.560]  many others we got a chance to stop it. Gerald Solente will talk to you again
[03:58:34.560 --> 03:58:39.120]  very soon. Hey, thanks for having me on. Glad you got out of Chili Safe. Great job
[03:58:39.120 --> 03:58:43.920]  crew retransmission jam-packed with Wayne Paul and others coming up. Thank you
[03:58:43.920 --> 03:58:53.200]  for listening to GCN. Visit GCNLive.com today. This is Alex Jones with five good
[03:58:53.200 --> 03:58:57.200]  reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator. Number one, new
[03:58:57.200 --> 03:59:00.960]  climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill. Number two,
[03:59:00.960 --> 03:59:05.360]  our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows
[03:59:05.360 --> 03:59:09.760]  you to have. It's true. Total government control of electricity in the name of
[03:59:09.760 --> 03:59:14.200]  smart grid technology is coming. Number three, in some areas of the country the
[03:59:14.200 --> 03:59:18.960]  power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only
[03:59:18.960 --> 03:59:22.760]  compounding the problem. Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to
[03:59:22.760 --> 03:59:26.360]  local grids. Every year thousands of families lose their power from weather
[03:59:26.360 --> 03:59:30.720]  related onages. Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup
[03:59:30.720 --> 03:59:33.840]  insurance and peace of mind. Folks, I really believe in the solar power
[03:59:33.840 --> 03:59:37.520]  generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors. You
