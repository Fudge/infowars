[00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:09.653]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:09.653 --> 00:00:11.234]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.234 --> 00:00:13.155]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.155 --> 00:00:16.977]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:16.977 --> 00:00:24.381]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:24.381 --> 00:00:30.505]  We have an important broadcast lined up today, ladies and gentlemen, and I want to thank you for joining us.
[00:00:30.505 --> 00:00:31.626]  We are live October 27th.
[00:00:34.865 --> 00:00:39.308]  2009 on this Tuesday edition.
[00:00:39.308 --> 00:00:43.252]  And we are going to take calls for the full four hours.
[00:00:43.252 --> 00:00:55.562]  I do have Constitution Party's son, great researcher, lawyer in his own right, Tim Baldwin, on an article he wrote that's very informative about the nature of our constitutional republic.
[00:00:55.562 --> 00:01:03.749]  And then for the third, or is it fourth and final time, at least for the time being, I have Lindsey Williams coming on today in the third hour.
[00:01:04.727 --> 00:01:06.249]  And when I say open phones, I mean it.
[00:01:06.249 --> 00:01:10.935]  We're going to have open phones throughout the broadcast today, and we're going to get Lindsey on.
[00:01:10.935 --> 00:01:20.468]  And one minute into Lindsey being on the show, we're going to go to your phone calls for your questions and comments for him on the revelations he's been bringing forward about the implosion of the economy by design in the next two years.
[00:01:21.803 --> 00:01:23.244]  A lot of people wanted to talk to him on air.
[00:01:23.244 --> 00:01:27.005]  We took some calls during one of the interviews, but I want to give the listeners an opportunity to talk to him.
[00:01:27.005 --> 00:01:35.969]  I really always enjoy and find it very edifying and informative the different angles and directions that listeners take us in when we open the phones up.
[00:01:35.969 --> 00:01:37.829]  There are so many issues to go over.
[00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:48.613]  The global carbon tax, the dollar, the economy, the police state, world government openly being announced coming out into the open.
[00:01:48.613 --> 00:01:49.774]  Still people are in denial.
[00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:53.181]  We're going to have open phones today.
[00:01:53.181 --> 00:01:57.202]  In fact, I'm not even going to cover the news or get into all the news stories I have here in front of me.
[00:01:57.202 --> 00:02:06.185]  We're going to take at least 30 minutes of calls before I even do a short news blitz at about 35 after or so, and then we will continue with your calls throughout the broadcast today.
[00:02:06.185 --> 00:02:07.926]  The toll-free number to join us is 1-800-259-9231.
[00:02:07.926 --> 00:02:08.006]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:02:08.006 --> 00:02:09.407]  And we'll be simulcasting at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:02:20.359 --> 00:02:21.780]  In the last two and a half hours today.
[00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:26.802]  We'll go live today at 2.30 central time.
[00:02:26.802 --> 00:02:30.524]  Or an hour and a half into the show for others listening on stations that rebroadcast.
[00:02:30.524 --> 00:02:30.744]  But 1-800-259-9231.
[00:02:30.744 --> 00:02:30.804]  800-259-9231.
[00:02:30.804 --> 00:02:33.285]  Someone trying to forcibly inoculate you or your children.
[00:02:33.285 --> 00:02:37.327]  We've confirmed mainstream reports that they are giving the flu shots to children without their consent.
[00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:51.281]  More news is coming out about deaths in Europe and the U.S.
[00:02:51.281 --> 00:02:54.292]  and other neurological disorders and seizures from the vaccines.
[00:02:55.458 --> 00:03:11.526]  We have Ban Ki-moon, the Secretary General, the puppet, he heads up the General Assembly, runs absolutely nothing, but he is the titular head, the figurehead, the frontman, the puppet, the shill, the fraud, the pitchman, the spokesperson for the United Nations.
[00:03:11.526 --> 00:03:23.732]  We can do it, an editorial in the New York Times calling for one world government, and the cornerstone of it, he says, is the global carbon tax for a global, let me give you his quote, global governance structure.
[00:03:24.997 --> 00:03:41.564]  Meanwhile, I was on 93.7 for 3 hours and 20 minutes today, and had callers, it was the minority of them, and they were even screening calls trying to get some to disagree, which is fine with me, it's more interesting, saying I'm a liar, none of this is happening.
[00:03:41.564 --> 00:03:43.225]  I even talked about Lake Travis.
[00:03:44.791 --> 00:03:50.614]  30 years ago or more when my dad took his diving, his master diver final check out.
[00:03:50.614 --> 00:03:54.477]  They dove in over 120 feet of water in Lake Travis.
[00:03:54.477 --> 00:04:02.101]  It looked like the Caribbean 25, 30 years ago, but because of all the golf course runoff and all of the, um,
[00:04:04.281 --> 00:04:08.623]  Lawn fertilizer, it's turning into a green slime pit, but they're not going to stop there.
[00:04:08.623 --> 00:04:13.946]  A bunch of towns on Lake Travis are going to start dumping sewage directly into the lake.
[00:04:13.946 --> 00:04:22.430]  And I went on air, and I had the Austin American-Statesman article, and they got calls on and off air that didn't believe it.
[00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:27.853]  I mean, even when they admit they're going to dump sewage in your water, people don't believe it.
[00:04:27.853 --> 00:04:30.574]  See, real environmentalism isn't practiced.
[00:04:32.361 --> 00:04:34.662]  Everything's actually getting worse with the real environment.
[00:04:34.662 --> 00:04:41.145]  Genetic engineering, open air, cross-species, planting of pharmacological crops, toxic waste dumping everywhere.
[00:04:41.145 --> 00:04:43.266]  But they're going to tax carbon dioxide that plants breathe.
[00:04:43.266 --> 00:04:43.786]  Don't worry.
[00:04:43.786 --> 00:04:48.548]  Because it has a scary name, like dihydrogen monoxide, or water.
[00:04:48.548 --> 00:04:49.869]  So we'll go over that too.
[00:04:49.869 --> 00:04:51.890]  Just massively important radio broadcast.
[00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:55.171]  Obama's flu emergency and a lot more.
[00:04:55.171 --> 00:04:57.993]  Straight ahead, right here on the one and the only, The Big GCN.
[00:05:00.796 --> 00:05:03.799]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[00:05:03.799 --> 00:05:09.144]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[00:05:09.144 --> 00:05:11.186]  My answer would be all I can get.
[00:05:11.186 --> 00:05:16.191]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[00:05:16.191 --> 00:05:17.112]  How much do you want?
[00:05:17.352 --> 00:05:18.473]  When do you want it?
[00:05:18.473 --> 00:05:20.354]  Now or after the battle starts?
[00:05:20.354 --> 00:05:21.435]  When will you need it?
[00:05:21.435 --> 00:05:23.636]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[00:05:23.636 --> 00:05:24.977]  Will there be any food?
[00:05:24.977 --> 00:05:26.518]  Will it make your children sick?
[00:05:26.518 --> 00:05:31.782]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[00:05:31.782 --> 00:05:35.364]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[00:05:35.364 --> 00:05:38.827]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[00:05:39.167 --> 00:05:40.388]  How much will you need?
[00:05:40.388 --> 00:05:41.309]  We don't know.
[00:05:41.309 --> 00:05:42.410]  How much do you want?
[00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:43.331]  All you can get.
[00:05:43.331 --> 00:05:44.433]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:05:44.433 --> 00:05:47.496]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[00:05:47.496 --> 00:05:49.258]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[00:05:49.258 --> 00:05:50.179]  Again that number 1-800-409-5633.
[00:06:02.091 --> 00:06:06.114]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:06:06.114 --> 00:06:09.357]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:06:09.357 --> 00:06:10.778]  As we're finishing off this agenda...
[00:06:11.668 --> 00:06:14.169]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:06:14.169 --> 00:06:20.531]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:06:20.531 --> 00:06:25.733]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[00:06:25.733 --> 00:06:35.716]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[00:06:35.836 --> 00:06:38.198]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[00:06:38.198 --> 00:06:39.779]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:06:39.779 --> 00:06:42.240]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:44.362]  Today, it seems like nobody does care.
[00:06:44.362 --> 00:06:49.505]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[00:06:49.505 --> 00:06:54.528]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com.
[00:06:54.528 --> 00:06:58.631]  Or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:07:05.546 --> 00:07:09.569]  Toxins are in our foods, and chemicals are in our air.
[00:07:09.569 --> 00:07:11.830]  Chemicals are in our water supply.
[00:07:11.830 --> 00:07:17.714]  We purify our air, we purify our water, and yet we forget to purify our bodies.
[00:07:17.714 --> 00:07:22.858]  Funny, our bodies continue to absorb these deadly toxins and chemicals every day.
[00:07:22.858 --> 00:07:24.759]  Isn't it time to make a change?
[00:07:24.759 --> 00:07:26.340]  Maybe a life change?
[00:07:26.340 --> 00:07:28.522]  Get rid of toxins and chemicals.
[00:07:29.162 --> 00:07:30.683]  GetTheTee.com.
[00:07:30.683 --> 00:07:34.645]  Log on to GetTheTee.com and order your protection today.

[00:07:40.688 --> 00:07:47.632]  That's 928-308-0408.
[00:07:47.632 --> 00:07:53.435]  Cleanse from toxins and chemicals, lose some weight, and get free from unhealthy living.
[00:07:53.435 --> 00:07:55.617]  Order today at GetTheTee.com.
[00:08:01.607 --> 00:08:04.390]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[00:08:04.390 --> 00:08:16.483]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:16.483 --> 00:08:17.584]  Okay, here's the deal.
[00:08:19.892 --> 00:08:26.936]  The head of the United Nations has written a disgusting editorial admitting everything, but putting a horrid spin on it.
[00:08:26.936 --> 00:08:29.397]  It's titled, We Can Do It.
[00:08:29.397 --> 00:08:38.722]  It's as silly and mindless as the Bob the Builder, Yes We Can, slogan parroted by the Obamanoids.
[00:08:38.722 --> 00:08:43.605]  There's also a big Gallup poll out showing the majority of Americans consider themselves conservatives.
[00:08:44.554 --> 00:08:46.575]  And a year and a half ago, everybody hated Bush.
[00:08:46.575 --> 00:08:47.895]  They considered themselves liberals.
[00:08:47.895 --> 00:08:52.077]  So people just keep hoping the other party out of power will save them.
[00:08:52.077 --> 00:08:58.960]  Then they figure out very, very quickly that that is not the case.
[00:08:58.960 --> 00:09:00.960]  Then they jump into the arms of the other party.
[00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:12.705]  But more and more people are waking up to the fact that both parties, not just here but in other countries around the world, all the major parties, some countries that have parliaments, have three or four big parties, five or six big parties,
[00:09:13.685 --> 00:09:21.667]  ...are totally controlled and people are beginning to identify the banking structure, the actual power structure that controls the globe today.
[00:09:21.667 --> 00:09:27.389]  And people are learning very, very fast that they are eugenicists, that they have a depopulation agenda.
[00:09:27.389 --> 00:09:29.950]  So the good news is people are really starting to wake up.
[00:09:29.950 --> 00:09:34.971]  Thanks to you, the listeners of this radio show.
[00:09:34.971 --> 00:09:37.332]  We are a large part of the global resistance.
[00:09:38.277 --> 00:09:50.444]  And we're in our embryonic stage right now, but the good news is we are growing very, very quickly and we have a massive responsibility.
[00:09:50.444 --> 00:09:51.324]  I get frustrated.
[00:09:51.324 --> 00:09:57.568]  I get angry a lot because at a very basic level in my psyche, in my wiring,
[00:09:58.740 --> 00:10:23.391]  To know we have a bunch of criminal tyrants in control, to fully understand intellectually with the evidence that we have a criminal elite who are the most abusive and sickening and out-of-control evil that history has ever seen, and to understand that their plan is now unfolding against free humanity is enraging.
[00:10:23.391 --> 00:10:26.753]  And I burn with a passionate
[00:10:27.699 --> 00:10:47.923]  Consuming, overriding desire to expose these people and to meet them on the field of intellectual battle and to disassemble their lies and their tricks and their different forms of bamboozling chicanery that they use against the population.
[00:10:49.969 --> 00:11:06.046]  And once people begin to question the power structure, once people begin to not just take what the mainstream media and politicians present at face value, once you get the people to just start looking and digging around and poking around and questioning on their own, the victory
[00:11:07.110 --> 00:11:13.412]  Though it may take a lot of time to come to its final fruition, is assured.
[00:11:13.412 --> 00:11:18.713]  The question is, how bad will it get before this technological enslavement system is overthrown?
[00:11:18.713 --> 00:11:27.276]  Because the establishment, in literally thousands of books and publications and white papers, brags that they're fully aware of how humans are going to resist what they're doing.
[00:11:27.276 --> 00:11:33.738]  They study their own species, and they are a predator class feeding on their own species, and they believe their final revolution
[00:11:35.728 --> 00:11:43.572]  Their scientific dictatorship will allow them to perfect this technological enslavement system.
[00:11:43.572 --> 00:12:03.361]  But the good news is, no matter how slick and how fancy and how much balkanization and divide-and-conquer they use, and no matter how much poison they put in the water incrementally, raising the dose so that we don't notice everybody dropping dead around us, no matter all the tricks they play and no matter how much they press down on the accelerator,
[00:12:04.438 --> 00:12:06.858]  of oppression, it is going to come down.
[00:12:06.858 --> 00:12:12.599]  The New World Order is dead on arrival.
[00:12:12.599 --> 00:12:15.880]  Now, we're going to take your phone calls.
[00:12:15.880 --> 00:12:23.181]  I'm going to do a news blitz at about 35 or 40 after, but we're going to continue to take phone calls throughout the broadcast today.
[00:12:23.181 --> 00:12:29.742]  Lindsey Williams joins us for an hour, his fourth interview in the last week and a half with us, breaking key news here, and this interview will be pure calls.
[00:12:29.742 --> 00:12:32.743]  From one minute in, with him on air with us, we're going to be taking your calls.
[00:12:33.391 --> 00:12:36.072]  Okay, let's talk to Chris in Kansas.
[00:12:36.072 --> 00:12:38.652]  Chris, you're on the air.
[00:12:38.652 --> 00:12:39.873]  Hi, Alex.
[00:12:39.873 --> 00:12:41.513]  Yes, sir.
[00:12:41.513 --> 00:12:46.214]  Hi, I'm just calling to give you an update on what's happening here in Topeka, Kansas.
[00:12:46.214 --> 00:13:00.278]  On the CJ Online News article, which is our local paper, this lady, Jennifer Williams, who works for Cotton O'Neill Express Care here in Topeka, is actually not wanting to get the swine flu vaccine.
[00:13:01.068 --> 00:13:13.835]  And the policy there at the hospital explains that if they don't, they have to sign a waiver and then they have to wear a surgical mask all through the wintertime, for whatever reason.
[00:13:13.835 --> 00:13:25.522]  And anyway, she quoted an article from the New American, a magazine published by American Opinion Publishing, which turns out to be a subsidiary of the John Birch Society.
[00:13:28.012 --> 00:13:32.654]  It says in that article that this year's H1N1 flu vaccine contains squalene.
[00:13:32.654 --> 00:13:53.100]  However, the Kansas Department of Health and Environment says that the vaccine does not contain squalene, and I've been keeping up with you and all the articles here locally about the H1N1, and turns out that the public here said there's a poll on the newspaper for that.
[00:13:53.100 --> 00:13:57.462]  Forty-three percent of the people say yes, they are going to be getting the vaccine
[00:13:57.867 --> 00:14:00.309]  They believe it is safe and effective.
[00:14:00.309 --> 00:14:09.917]  Only 28% say no if they don't trust the vaccine and it has not been tested adequately for safety.
[00:14:09.917 --> 00:14:13.080]  I'll just give you an update on what was going on here.
[00:14:13.080 --> 00:14:15.963]  I will not be getting the vaccine myself.
[00:14:15.963 --> 00:14:17.964]  So, that's all I got for you Alex.
[00:14:17.964 --> 00:14:19.586]  Alright Chris, thank you so much.
[00:14:20.922 --> 00:14:34.292]  There are five different companies making the injectable H1N1 vaccine and one company making the live virus nasal, which the insert admits can breed the flu and spread the flu.
[00:14:34.292 --> 00:14:35.914]  That's why they released that first to spread it.
[00:14:37.006 --> 00:14:40.208]  It has mercury in it as the adjuvant.
[00:14:40.208 --> 00:14:52.974]  Mercury, according to Dr. Blaylock and other medical doctors we've had on here that are experts in this field, have stated that mercury is an adjuvant as well, not only a deadly heavy metal neurotoxin.
[00:14:52.974 --> 00:14:58.276]  The European version, some of the European versions do have squalene.
[00:14:58.276 --> 00:14:59.097]  Most of the U.S.
[00:14:59.097 --> 00:15:05.360]  versions do not have squalene, but they do have the cancer viruses, the mercury, and a bunch of other additives in them.
[00:15:06.590 --> 00:15:09.171]  Okay, let's talk to Allen in Florida.
[00:15:09.171 --> 00:15:11.751]  Allen, you're on the air.
[00:15:11.751 --> 00:15:15.432]  Yes, I got a situation I want to know about.
[00:15:15.432 --> 00:15:19.453]  It's unlawful searches by the Hillsborough County School District.
[00:15:19.453 --> 00:15:20.893]  What do I mean by that?
[00:15:20.893 --> 00:15:27.954]  When we get reports of children who say they're going to bring a gun to school, we actually contact the parents.
[00:15:27.954 --> 00:15:36.136]  And then, I don't know how we get away with this, but we actually go into the family's home and search the child's room looking for said firearm.
[00:15:36.721 --> 00:15:38.424]  But there's no warrants, nothing.
[00:15:38.424 --> 00:15:40.328]  Yeah, that's a knock and talk.
[00:15:40.328 --> 00:15:48.143]  That's a knock and talk and so they just kind of forced their way in, setting the common law precedent through custom.
[00:15:49.426 --> 00:15:54.067]  That they come in your home without a warrant, and they do it all over the place.
[00:15:54.067 --> 00:16:07.790]  If a child writes an essay that says, my dad's a captain in the Marine Corps, this is a real case, and he has an M-16, because they ask you to write about your parents, and they do it digitally, and they store it, and the feds get it, that's also been in the news, and then they use that.
[00:16:07.790 --> 00:16:13.191]  And I've seen reports where high school students, one guy was a straight-A student, no criminal record,
[00:16:13.931 --> 00:16:16.513]  His parents were divorced, he was living with his grandparents.
[00:16:16.513 --> 00:16:35.206]  They read his essay, his English teacher didn't think it was bad, about zombies attacking a fictitious school, and they came and arrested him, and he was sent to prison, juvenile prison, for writing it, and they said, we don't care if it's fictitious, you don't talk about shooting zombies at a school.
[00:16:35.206 --> 00:16:41.711]  And the funny thing was, in the sixth grade, it was sixth grade, intermediate, I wrote a story,
[00:16:43.762 --> 00:17:00.535]  uh... about zombies attacking the school and in the article uh... one of the young man who was in the same class with me name was Corey Strange black guy good friend of mine
[00:17:01.724 --> 00:17:07.148]  We kind of wrote different versions of him and I killing the zombies.
[00:17:07.148 --> 00:17:10.431]  And so, in America now, I would have been arrested.
[00:17:10.431 --> 00:17:14.014]  Doesn't matter how many TV shows and video games are about killing zombies.
[00:17:14.014 --> 00:17:16.255]  You do that now, you get arrested.
[00:17:16.255 --> 00:17:18.997]  Or they catch a pocket knife in your car, you get arrested.
[00:17:18.997 --> 00:17:24.762]  Or you bring plastic Dixie knives, forks, and spoons to cut up a cake for an after-school party for your teacher when you're a senior.
[00:17:24.762 --> 00:17:26.743]  I've seen articles of that happening repeatedly.
[00:17:26.743 --> 00:17:28.305]  You get arrested for the plastic knife.
[00:17:29.045 --> 00:17:30.987]  And it's all part of training everyone that they're a prisoner.
[00:17:30.987 --> 00:17:32.788]  Appreciate the call, Alan.
[00:17:32.788 --> 00:17:34.109]  Jason in Georgia.
[00:17:34.109 --> 00:17:36.791]  Jason, you're on the air.
[00:17:36.791 --> 00:17:37.492]  Yeah, Alex.
[00:17:37.492 --> 00:17:38.473]  How are you doing?
[00:17:38.473 --> 00:17:39.854]  Good.
[00:17:39.854 --> 00:17:40.154]  Great.
[00:17:40.154 --> 00:17:42.436]  Listen, just reporting in from South Georgia.
[00:17:42.436 --> 00:17:45.959]  I want to let you know, my wife's a pharmacist.
[00:17:45.959 --> 00:17:50.923]  And their hospital's trying to force everybody to take the vaccine.
[00:17:50.923 --> 00:17:55.867]  Oh, but Obama says they don't try to force anybody, even though they're forcing school kids to take it.
[00:17:57.125 --> 00:18:03.053]  Another point I wanted to get in, I've been following Tex Mars for quite a while.
[00:18:03.053 --> 00:18:14.448]  There's a youth group in town that sponsored a hardcore Christian rock group to come in and two of the members are doing the El Diablo sign on their promo flyer.
[00:18:17.435 --> 00:18:19.197]  Well, that's interesting.
[00:18:19.197 --> 00:18:24.462]  I mean, when it's obvious and people are doing that, a lot of them just do it because it means rebellion or having fun.
[00:18:24.462 --> 00:18:29.306]  But yes, Christianity certainly has been infiltrated by a lot of that.
[00:18:29.306 --> 00:18:34.751]  My only thing with the El Diablo is when you show UT fans doing it, they don't think they're worshipping the devil.
[00:18:35.731 --> 00:18:45.636]  You know, people can slow down video of myself when I'm waving my arms around and sometimes because I've broken my hand so many times and the tendons are out of alignment.
[00:18:45.636 --> 00:18:47.977]  I don't have any knuckles on my two middle fingers.
[00:18:47.977 --> 00:18:49.257]  Plus, I cut one finger off.
[00:18:49.257 --> 00:18:50.258]  They tend to curl back.
[00:18:50.258 --> 00:18:52.119]  I've got arthritis in the hand.
[00:18:52.119 --> 00:18:55.180]  People say, oh look, there's the elbow, you know, the El Diablo there.
[00:18:55.180 --> 00:18:56.301]  But when politicians do it,
[00:18:57.332 --> 00:19:01.874]  And the Pope does it, and everybody else does it, and puts their thumb on their two middle fingers.
[00:19:01.874 --> 00:19:09.036]  It is extremely obvious what's going on, and it's an occult sign, obviously, to the devil.
[00:19:09.036 --> 00:19:12.397]  But, you know, people also go overboard and show Ron Paul getting out of a car.
[00:19:12.397 --> 00:19:17.039]  And I happen to know Ron Paul has very bad arthritis, so does his brother Wayne.
[00:19:17.039 --> 00:19:25.302]  And so we have to be careful at the same time off of, you know, people slowing down video and saying, oh look,
[00:19:26.162 --> 00:19:30.906]  And I've even given a few speeches before when I've talked about the El Diablo, and I've done it, and people say, look!
[00:19:30.906 --> 00:19:32.908]  It's, you know, it's Alex, he's doing it.
[00:19:32.908 --> 00:19:40.874]  But certainly, if it's a Christian rock band, they're doing it on an album cover, that's pretty obvious what they're doing, and that's pretty serious, so I wouldn't send my children to that.
[00:19:40.874 --> 00:19:43.316]  Anything else, sir?
[00:19:43.316 --> 00:19:43.917]  Okay.
[00:19:43.917 --> 00:19:45.218]  We're gonna continue with phone calls.
[00:19:45.218 --> 00:19:46.139]  Hey, I'm doing a good job here.
[00:19:47.062 --> 00:19:50.526]  We're going to take a lot of them because I do want to shake the show up.
[00:19:50.526 --> 00:19:58.475]  It's really growing by leaps and bounds and I have a great responsibility to the listeners to cover a lot of topics and there's no better way to do that than to take your calls.
[00:20:00.748 --> 00:20:04.532]  Heart-related health problems affect millions of people each year.
[00:20:04.532 --> 00:20:14.682]  Maybe you're one of the many who suffer from issues related to angina pain, high blood pressure, congestive heart failure, unbalanced cholesterol, irregular heartbeat, or clogged arteries.
[00:20:14.682 --> 00:20:21.930]  There is a solution that doesn't involve expensive prescription drugs that only mask the problem and leave you with horrible side effects.
[00:20:22.150 --> 00:20:36.445]  If you're ready to live your life free of sickness, pain and fear, live your life with increased vitality, energy and youthfulness and experience your body healing itself, then you're ready for Heart and Body Extract from Healthy Hearts Club.
[00:20:36.445 --> 00:20:41.450]  Heart and Body Extract has a 23-year proven track record of using certified organic
[00:20:41.510 --> 00:20:41.870]  I think so.
[00:21:00.498 --> 00:21:02.659]  Why are you letting that search engine spy on you?
[00:21:02.659 --> 00:21:03.520]  Spy on me?
[00:21:03.520 --> 00:21:03.840]  Yeah.
[00:21:03.840 --> 00:21:08.903]  Don't you know Google, Yahoo, and other search engines record all your searches and store them in a giant database?
[00:21:08.903 --> 00:21:10.524]  You should use Startpage instead.
[00:21:10.524 --> 00:21:11.264]  Startpage?
[00:21:11.264 --> 00:21:11.685]  Yeah.
[00:21:11.685 --> 00:21:12.785]  Startpage.com.
[00:21:12.785 --> 00:21:15.747]  The new name for Ixquik, the world's most private search engine.
[00:21:15.747 --> 00:21:19.609]  They don't record your searches or your IP address, and the search results are great.
[00:21:19.609 --> 00:21:22.471]  Plus, Startpage is third-party certified, and it's totally free.
[00:21:22.751 --> 00:21:25.373]  I don't want Big Brother watching what I do on the internet.
[00:21:25.373 --> 00:21:26.954]  I'm adding StartPage to my browser.
[00:21:26.954 --> 00:21:27.254]  Right!

[00:21:30.576 --> 00:21:31.136]  Hello, folks.
[00:21:31.136 --> 00:21:32.497]  This is Alex Jones.
[00:21:32.497 --> 00:21:36.360]  There are some habits you need to break if you want to hold on to your privacy.
[00:21:36.360 --> 00:21:40.142]  That's why I'm inviting you to take the one-week StartPage challenge.

[00:21:48.688 --> 00:21:50.433]  Do yourself and your privacy a favor.

[00:21:54.745 --> 00:21:56.350]  That's StartPage.com
[00:22:00.489 --> 00:22:01.529]  Hello, Ted Anderson.
[00:22:01.529 --> 00:22:06.492]  Listeners of the network are familiar with the Federal Reserve Note and understand the risks of deficit spending.
[00:22:06.492 --> 00:22:14.555]  Therefore, with catastrophic events, it comes as no surprise that some banks have currently placed limits on the amount of cash depositors can remove from their accounts.
[00:22:14.555 --> 00:22:20.138]  A fractional reserve system means only a small portion of your deposit is held in reserve for immediate withdrawal.
[00:22:20.138 --> 00:22:27.101]  Deficit spending will skyrocket through FDIC if the government is forced to insure deposits during a bank run followed by a depressed economy.
[00:22:27.401 --> 00:22:33.004]  A current effort is underway by the Fed along with other central banks to increase liquidity for depositors.
[00:22:33.004 --> 00:22:38.067]  However, an increase in money supply without equal expansion in productivity can cause inflation.
[00:22:38.067 --> 00:22:46.011]  In order to achieve strength and stability, I recommend a conservative portion of all investments to be calmly repositioned into gold and silver.
[00:22:46.011 --> 00:22:48.693]  While paper investments currently have been driven by debt,
[00:22:49.153 --> 00:22:52.575]  Gold on its own has held value for over 6,000 years.
[00:22:52.575 --> 00:22:53.816]  For more information call 1-800-686-2237.
[00:22:53.816 --> 00:22:54.016]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:22:59.947 --> 00:23:01.709]  Say no to government vaccinations.
[00:23:01.709 --> 00:23:03.230]  Say no to toxic overload.
[00:23:03.230 --> 00:23:04.571]  Say no to chemicals.
[00:23:04.571 --> 00:23:06.513]  Say yes to liquid zeolite.
[00:23:06.513 --> 00:23:15.300]  When you have fatigue, problems concentrating, muscle weakness, headaches, digestion, memory loss, influenza, or joint pain, the solution may be as simple as detoxifying your body.
[00:23:15.300 --> 00:23:20.725]  Chemical-free liquid zeolite helps the body heal itself so that it can become stronger to fight off viruses.
[00:23:20.725 --> 00:23:22.326]  Why risk government vaccinations?
[00:23:22.526 --> 00:23:30.010]  Liquid Zeolite detoxifies the body by safely helping remove toxins and heavy metals, boosting energy levels, and promoting a strong immune system.
[00:23:30.010 --> 00:23:34.192]  Liquid Zeolite is tasteless, odorless, and so gentle you won't even know you're taking it.
[00:23:34.192 --> 00:23:36.914]  Feel great again in as little as three days to three weeks.
[00:23:36.914 --> 00:23:41.896]  Liquid Zeolite comes with a money-back guarantee, but it's only available at RestoreYourHealthNow.com.
[00:23:41.896 --> 00:23:45.798]  Learn how to get free bottles of Liquid Zeolite at RestoreYourHealthNow.com.
[00:23:45.798 --> 00:23:48.300]  That's RestoreYourHealthNow.com or call 1-800-976-0025.
[00:23:51.141 --> 00:23:52.702]  During the break, we were just talking about...
[00:24:10.640 --> 00:24:14.884]  How they give you the flu vaccine and it gives you the flu.
[00:24:14.884 --> 00:24:19.449]  And the inserts admit it gives you the flu in many cases and allows you to spread the flu.
[00:24:19.449 --> 00:24:25.195]  There's like the smallpox injection from 2002-2003 they tried to make first responders take.
[00:24:25.195 --> 00:24:26.095]  Killed a bunch of people.
[00:24:26.095 --> 00:24:28.398]  Caused an autoimmune response in the heart.
[00:24:28.398 --> 00:24:32.081]  If you had any type of buildup in your heart it would cause an autoimmune response.
[00:24:32.081 --> 00:24:34.143]  And just like if you get stung by a wasp,
[00:24:35.031 --> 00:24:38.233]  Your throat will swell up and you can choke to death.
[00:24:38.233 --> 00:24:39.494]  That's an autoimmune response.
[00:24:39.494 --> 00:24:41.175]  That's an allergic response.
[00:24:41.175 --> 00:24:46.278]  And it does that in your organs, in your pancreas, and we've got all the literature and it isn't stopping.
[00:24:46.278 --> 00:24:53.923]  And everyone I know knows someone who went on antidepressants for a car wreck or losing their job who commits suicide.
[00:24:53.923 --> 00:24:56.705]  Everyone I know knows people who've committed suicide.
[00:24:56.705 --> 00:25:03.730]  Everyone I know knows 25, 30-year-old men and women who are in great shape, don't use drugs, who are dying or have died of cancer.
[00:25:04.881 --> 00:25:14.146]  And they know, they knew in 1981 when Donald Rumsfeld headed the company, he got aspartame approved, he sold nuclear reactors in North Korea to Pakistan.
[00:25:14.146 --> 00:25:16.988]  Anything evil, he gets it approved.
[00:25:16.988 --> 00:25:28.115]  When he got serotonin reuptake inhibitors approved with the first one, Eli Lilly's Prozac, they knew it made large numbers commit suicide or become violent.
[00:25:29.011 --> 00:25:32.799]  And almost every military person who's on this stuff who works at the post office.
[00:25:32.799 --> 00:25:37.608]  When you're in the military, they pretty much automatically give you a job at the post office.
[00:25:37.608 --> 00:25:40.775]  And that's why in almost all these people that go in and shoot everybody, we're on it.
[00:25:42.657 --> 00:26:00.977]  And just to sit here and to know that they know it's going to make kids shoot people at school, they know it's going to make people commit suicide, then they give the kids death education about don't commit suicide, and they show them ways to commit suicide, and then suicide numbers explode, and then they put even more kids on the drugs, and they bring psychologists into the schools.
[00:26:01.317 --> 00:26:01.677]  We're good to go.
[00:26:24.264 --> 00:26:27.785]  They then set up systems to counter what they themselves have created.
[00:26:27.785 --> 00:26:37.128]  Just like the government's been caught and the Federal Reserve's been caught many, many times shipping in cocaine, heroin, laundering the drug proceeds, using it for black ops.
[00:26:37.128 --> 00:26:44.451]  The 1996 Solicitor General, Inspector General of the CIA confirmed in testimony they shipped in the majority of the cocaine in the 80s.
[00:26:46.733 --> 00:26:56.241]  CIA and Pentagon was caught shipping in tons and tons and tons and tons, tens of thousands of tons of pure heroin out of the Golden Triangle in Vietnam.
[00:26:56.241 --> 00:26:58.443]  The government is run by criminals.
[00:26:58.443 --> 00:27:08.230]  The mafia, the global mafia, uses government as their envelope of authority to feed parasitically off the population.
[00:27:08.230 --> 00:27:09.131]  And I'm sick of it.
[00:27:09.131 --> 00:27:10.532]  We've got to stop it.
[00:27:10.532 --> 00:27:12.274]  John in Florida, John you're on the air.
[00:27:13.305 --> 00:27:14.906]  Hey, lockstep to you, man.
[00:27:14.906 --> 00:27:21.291]  This is like some kind of Stepford Wive movie where everybody's hypnotized or something.
[00:27:21.291 --> 00:27:22.391]  I've never seen anything like it.
[00:27:22.391 --> 00:27:32.839]  But getting back to that drug thing, I just wanted to hit on it quick because have you ever heard of those guys that were running the drugs?
[00:27:32.839 --> 00:27:34.220]  The guy fell out of a parachute.
[00:27:34.220 --> 00:27:38.463]  His parachute didn't open in Knoxville, Tennessee, and it made the front page headlines.
[00:27:38.908 --> 00:27:39.348]  Yes, I saw that.
[00:27:39.348 --> 00:27:41.630]  I have seen no exaggeration in the last 14 years on air without looking.
[00:27:41.630 --> 00:27:41.930]  Limitless.
[00:27:41.930 --> 00:27:42.790]  I mean, I don't have a number.
[00:27:42.790 --> 00:27:43.251]  I see hundreds a year.
[00:27:43.251 --> 00:27:44.732]  So, hundreds a year for 14 years.
[00:28:08.732 --> 00:28:11.193]  We're talking 1,400 or more.
[00:28:11.193 --> 00:28:12.954]  I mean, I saw one two days ago.
[00:28:12.954 --> 00:28:16.776]  I see them every couple days.
[00:28:16.776 --> 00:28:28.703]  And where the state police in Texas, famous AP case, most of them don't get attention, an 18-wheeler in South Texas filled with pure cocaine, meaning it was coming directly from the source.
[00:28:28.703 --> 00:28:29.763]  It was uncut.
[00:28:29.763 --> 00:28:32.145]  This was coming in out of Central and South America.
[00:28:32.145 --> 00:28:33.966]  Pure cocaine.
[00:28:33.966 --> 00:28:36.207]  The driver told the state police, you better watch your butt.
[00:28:37.079 --> 00:28:44.561]  The FBI came in with the Justice Department, took the cocaine, and it disappeared, and it turned out it was a CIA shipment.
[00:28:44.561 --> 00:28:51.463]  CIA aircraft have crashed in Florida, Texas, Georgia, California, all over the country.
[00:28:51.463 --> 00:28:55.685]  Ships constantly get caught, the police get... I mean, it's been an esquire.
[00:28:55.685 --> 00:29:02.647]  They had a big article a few years ago of all these cases where DEA will go bust a plane or a truck, and the guy's driving and just say, you're in a lot of trouble, pal.
[00:29:04.236 --> 00:29:07.018]  And just sit there saying, watch yourself.
[00:29:07.018 --> 00:29:08.759]  You don't put me in handcuffs, buddy.
[00:29:08.759 --> 00:29:09.960]  This is national security.
[00:29:09.960 --> 00:29:14.563]  When they do, sometimes they get killed, or their wife gets killed, or their dog gets killed.
[00:29:14.563 --> 00:29:16.365]  I mean, they don't play games.
[00:29:16.365 --> 00:29:17.505]  And they ship it in.
[00:29:17.505 --> 00:29:23.129]  And the only people they bust for drugs are the cowboys and the people that don't pay their cut.
[00:29:23.129 --> 00:29:30.595]  And the military's used all over the world to go after anybody that's growing opium, the poppies, or growing the coca leaves.
[00:29:31.515 --> 00:29:33.336]  Or any drugs that they're not getting.
[00:29:33.336 --> 00:29:36.538]  But yes, I do remember that article.
[00:29:36.538 --> 00:29:38.639]  Yeah, it's like a total take-off.
[00:29:38.639 --> 00:29:41.140]  I can't believe how many people are doing drugs, though.
[00:29:41.140 --> 00:29:45.662]  But the latest PR move they got down here on a swine flu... Stay there.
[00:29:45.662 --> 00:29:46.002]  Stay there.
[00:29:46.002 --> 00:29:47.183]  I'm going to come back to you.
[00:29:47.183 --> 00:29:51.205]  Yeah, don't use any drugs, period.
[00:29:51.205 --> 00:29:52.605]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.605 --> 00:29:55.127]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.127 --> 00:29:57.808]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:00.120 --> 00:30:05.427]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[00:30:05.427 --> 00:30:09.973]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[00:30:09.973 --> 00:30:12.236]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[00:30:12.236 --> 00:30:13.878]  You don't have to cooperate.
[00:30:13.878 --> 00:30:14.900]  There is a solution.
[00:30:15.120 --> 00:30:23.542]  Inner Health Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.

[00:30:37.046 --> 00:30:42.627]  I love their Nutri-Cafe, great organic coffee infused with herbal extracts to boost your immune system.

[00:31:02.492 --> 00:31:06.513]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:31:06.513 --> 00:31:09.754]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:31:09.754 --> 00:31:11.154]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[00:31:11.894 --> 00:31:14.555]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:31:14.555 --> 00:31:20.938]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:31:20.938 --> 00:31:26.141]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[00:31:26.141 --> 00:31:36.126]  Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[00:31:36.246 --> 00:31:38.588]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[00:31:38.588 --> 00:31:40.169]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:31:40.169 --> 00:31:42.630]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:31:42.630 --> 00:31:44.752]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[00:31:44.752 --> 00:31:49.915]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[00:31:49.915 --> 00:31:59.021]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:32:01.294 --> 00:32:02.595]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:32:02.595 --> 00:32:08.178]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[00:32:08.178 --> 00:32:13.200]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[00:32:13.200 --> 00:32:18.783]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again.
[00:32:18.783 --> 00:32:24.006]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[00:32:24.006 --> 00:32:25.867]  They call it a survival seed bank.
[00:32:26.297 --> 00:32:31.100]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[00:32:31.100 --> 00:32:32.221]  And here's the best part.
[00:32:32.221 --> 00:32:35.302]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[00:32:35.302 --> 00:32:38.924]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[00:32:38.924 --> 00:32:42.106]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[00:32:42.106 --> 00:32:44.328]  That's survivalseedbank.com.
[00:32:44.328 --> 00:32:45.268]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[00:32:45.268 --> 00:32:45.468]  That's 877-327-0365.
[00:32:45.468 --> 00:32:46.589]  Remember, in a real crisis,
[00:32:55.427 --> 00:32:57.949]  Non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[00:32:57.949 --> 00:33:02.112]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[00:33:02.112 --> 00:33:07.956]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:07.956 --> 00:33:10.298]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:33:10.298 --> 00:33:19.244]  We have a couple television sets.
[00:33:24.335 --> 00:33:42.984]  I tuned a satellite out in the control room, and I was watching CNN, and they had these cute little children, little toddlers, in pretty little dresses with their mommies, lining them up, giving them the H1N1 shot.
[00:33:42.984 --> 00:33:47.066]  You take three flu shots with the Marisol, and they all have it.
[00:33:48.223 --> 00:33:53.829]  And you double your chances of Alzheimer's in hundreds of government and university studies.
[00:33:53.829 --> 00:33:59.014]  And you tell people this and they look at you like you're lying.
[00:33:59.014 --> 00:34:01.177]  And it's more than just denial.
[00:34:01.177 --> 00:34:03.719]  It's ingrained laziness.
[00:34:03.719 --> 00:34:05.181]  But it's more than that.
[00:34:05.181 --> 00:34:11.487]  Somehow they've tricked large numbers of people to think it's cute and funny to laugh at corruption or danger.
[00:34:12.452 --> 00:34:29.301]  And that it's cute and funny to laugh about government corruption, and that none of it exists, and the world's all happy and fun and good, and good people run the medical system, and good people run the water supply, and good people, and that everything's wonderful.
[00:34:29.301 --> 00:34:41.508]  And I'm gonna news blitz here in a moment after I take calls, but I was on 93.7, the number one morning talk station, talk slash rock and roll,
[00:34:42.935 --> 00:34:46.816]  And I was on there for three hours and 20 minutes today.
[00:34:46.816 --> 00:34:51.198]  And most of the callers agreed with me.
[00:34:51.198 --> 00:34:54.179]  We're thanking them for having me on.
[00:34:54.179 --> 00:34:59.660]  But some called in and just said, I'm a liar.
[00:34:59.660 --> 00:35:03.622]  And some were calling off air because they screen calls there.
[00:35:03.622 --> 00:35:05.022]  See if somebody can put a sentence together.
[00:35:08.044 --> 00:35:15.190]  And they thought I was making it up that sewage would be dumped in Lake Travis, the big pretty lake we have outside Austin.
[00:35:15.190 --> 00:35:17.512]  I mean, it was in the newspaper this morning.
[00:35:17.512 --> 00:35:20.775]  I heard about it a few weeks ago.
[00:35:20.775 --> 00:35:22.956]  And it really is a microcosm of the rest of the country.
[00:35:22.956 --> 00:35:28.561]  I mean, they really thought they wouldn't put sewage in the lake!
[00:35:28.561 --> 00:35:30.523]  You're a liar!
[00:35:30.523 --> 00:35:31.163]  Where is it?
[00:35:31.163 --> 00:35:32.004]  Where's your proof?
[00:35:35.592 --> 00:35:41.438]  And I like the host on the show, but even one of them was looking at me like I was crazy until I gave them the newspaper.
[00:35:41.438 --> 00:35:45.603]  But I mean, like, I'm gonna get up here and say there's mercury in the vaccines and there's not.
[00:35:45.603 --> 00:35:49.547]  Or, like, I'm gonna get up here and tell you it can give you brain damage.
[00:35:49.547 --> 00:35:50.528]  It's on the insert!
[00:35:50.528 --> 00:35:57.295]  I mean, I'm just... Literally, no exaggeration, hundreds of articles a day calling for world government.
[00:36:00.353 --> 00:36:14.879]  Presentatorial yesterday, I got it last night, so I say today, by the Secretary General of the UN, saying the cornerstone, the jewel in the crown, the nexus, the heart, the center of the wheel that all the spokes go out from,
[00:36:16.582 --> 00:36:20.165]  Is the global carbon tax, and that it's a tax for global government.
[00:36:20.165 --> 00:36:24.388]  And they're announcing they're going to tax your dogs, your cats, anything that eats meat.
[00:36:24.388 --> 00:36:28.271]  They're announcing they're going to tax all your energy, all your power, everything.
[00:36:28.271 --> 00:36:29.331]  They're going to home inspect.
[00:36:29.331 --> 00:36:34.115]  They're setting up weird army intelligence officers in every major city to run it.
[00:36:34.115 --> 00:36:36.096]  I mean, this is super creepy.
[00:36:36.096 --> 00:36:37.397]  Off the charts bad.
[00:36:37.397 --> 00:36:39.539]  I can't believe how bad the government is.
[00:36:39.539 --> 00:36:43.061]  I mean, that they can fine this many traders.
[00:36:43.061 --> 00:36:43.622]  Parasites.
[00:36:47.188 --> 00:36:51.470]  And people have been trained to just laugh it off and everything's going to be okay.
[00:36:51.470 --> 00:36:53.852]  No, everything is not going to be alright.
[00:36:53.852 --> 00:36:57.134]  And I told the Obama supporters this.
[00:36:57.134 --> 00:37:01.596]  You're going to be betrayed by Obama and he's now betrayed you and some are waking up.
[00:37:01.596 --> 00:37:05.098]  And I told Bush supporters he was nothing but a puppet there to pacify you.
[00:37:05.098 --> 00:37:08.440]  But you didn't care when he tripled government or spied on the American people.
[00:37:08.440 --> 00:37:10.201]  You didn't care when he started all these wars.
[00:37:10.201 --> 00:37:12.382]  You didn't care when he put in the police state grid.
[00:37:13.800 --> 00:37:16.926]  But now that Obama's continuing all these policies, you suddenly hate him.
[00:37:16.926 --> 00:37:26.223]  But all the Democrats that hated the war, Code Pink, and all these huge George Soros publications,
[00:37:28.533 --> 00:37:33.458]  And all the big democratic organizations are all announcing how great the wars are now.
[00:37:33.458 --> 00:37:50.615]  And suddenly, you don't see any peace rallies, or if there are, small ones, the police just show up and hit you with LRAD cannons and literally chase down women with billy clubs, beating their heads in with blood spewing in all directions, and police dogs, old women walk out, no one's allowed, over a million people in Pittsburgh, women walk out front,
[00:37:51.775 --> 00:37:59.579]  Businesses and police dogs run up and the women say, we're just shopping, and the police scream, get off the street and start biting them with dogs!
[00:37:59.579 --> 00:38:02.901]  I mean, that's worse than Hitler!
[00:38:02.901 --> 00:38:09.285]  We're already so far down the rat hole, it makes my head spin.
[00:38:09.285 --> 00:38:19.731]  And then some of the people in the office heard me talking about how everybody knows someone who's committed suicide on Prozac or a Prozac-type serotonin reuptake inhibitor drug, and how nuts it makes people
[00:38:21.724 --> 00:38:21.884]  I think?
[00:38:44.580 --> 00:38:49.824]  If I could just get Austin and Travis County to admit they're going to dump sewage in the lake, we could stop it.
[00:38:49.824 --> 00:38:50.625]  But you know what?
[00:38:50.625 --> 00:38:53.247]  They're just going to deny they're doing it until it's too late.
[00:38:53.247 --> 00:38:57.290]  I mean, that's how everything works around here.
[00:38:57.290 --> 00:39:02.254]  And so now, a lake that looked like the Caribbean 30 years ago is going to be a toilet.
[00:39:03.840 --> 00:39:05.941]  It's already screwed up, all the stuff they dump in it.
[00:39:05.941 --> 00:39:06.781]  They just don't care!
[00:39:06.781 --> 00:39:09.442]  And this is supposedly the environmentalist capital.
[00:39:09.442 --> 00:39:12.363]  They're not environmentalists, they want to steal your property.
[00:39:12.363 --> 00:39:30.071]  All the big state senators and former mayors and all the rest of them that stole over 15,000 acres under SOS Save Our Springs, the minute they stole all these farmers and ranchers' land, gave them in some cases one penny on the dollar, in some cases ten cents on the dollar, they built hotels and luxury homes all over it, now they're dumping sewer
[00:39:31.252 --> 00:39:32.034]  Water in the lake.
[00:39:32.034 --> 00:39:33.356]  And it's just all funny to them.
[00:39:33.356 --> 00:39:40.470]  It's all a big joke.
[00:39:40.470 --> 00:39:42.414]  They're all a bunch of crooks.
[00:39:42.414 --> 00:39:43.316]  And they think it's funny.
[00:39:45.953 --> 00:39:46.994]  And you know what the public's going to do?
[00:39:46.994 --> 00:39:54.763]  They're going to go out there and jet ski and fish and just wade around in the feces and just talk in the stink of the sewage.
[00:39:54.763 --> 00:39:55.423]  Oh, I love it.
[00:39:55.423 --> 00:39:56.545]  There's no sewage in here.
[00:39:56.545 --> 00:39:57.686]  Alex is a liar.
[00:39:57.686 --> 00:40:05.975]  Just like the government and the media, just like Hardin, Montana, admitted 14 time felons, 17 aliases, hiring all these other felons, coming in with
[00:40:06.235 --> 00:40:12.797]  Police cars marked up with private security firm trying to police people and the city council announcing he was going to be the new police chief.
[00:40:12.797 --> 00:40:14.878]  And then when it came out, he was a felon and a con artist.
[00:40:14.878 --> 00:40:16.639]  They all said in the newspaper, we don't care.
[00:40:16.639 --> 00:40:20.240]  We like him and we're just going to give him some more property to take over the town.
[00:40:20.240 --> 00:40:23.221]  And we like the detention center.
[00:40:23.221 --> 00:40:24.981]  People want to get hurt.
[00:40:24.981 --> 00:40:25.582]  And you know why?
[00:40:25.582 --> 00:40:29.783]  Because once you've given yourself over to evil and corruption, you start liking it.
[00:40:29.783 --> 00:40:32.404]  You start thinking sewage water is good and clean.
[00:40:33.837 --> 00:40:45.008]  You start thinking 51 million abortions they've had since 1973 with Roe v. Wade, you start thinking it's a wonderful good thing and it's not a human being, so why not just euthanize old people?
[00:40:45.008 --> 00:40:46.390]  Why not deny people healthcare?
[00:40:48.752 --> 00:40:53.174]  We are an evil, sickening, degenerate, scum-filled society.
[00:40:53.174 --> 00:41:04.400]  And we had better come to grips with that and understand that when you become corrupt and people stop caring about each other, and people stop being involved, and people get dumbed down, that bad things happen.
[00:41:04.400 --> 00:41:13.344]  That corrupt governments take you over, tax you to launch huge wars, ship your sons off to die in them, and now your daughters.
[00:41:13.344 --> 00:41:14.225]  We are a conquered
[00:41:17.583 --> 00:41:21.265]  Sewage pit.
[00:41:21.265 --> 00:41:25.328]  And the globalists are all stealing everything that's even nailed down and leaving the country.
[00:41:25.328 --> 00:41:29.710]  They've been leaving for three years.
[00:41:29.710 --> 00:41:41.538]  To know that the mainstream media comes right out after decades of denying it and just calmly announces, oh, by the way, we are chemtrailing you with a huge secret program.
[00:41:41.538 --> 00:41:45.500]  And then you look at the science, they're trying to heat the earth.
[00:41:47.984 --> 00:41:49.225]  Tell me why they're doing that.
[00:41:49.225 --> 00:41:51.767]  They won't say.
[00:41:51.767 --> 00:41:56.690]  They tell the public the Earth's heating, but they're trying to heat the Earth.
[00:41:56.690 --> 00:42:02.414]  NASA reports the planet's 20% darker from all the spraying.
[00:42:02.414 --> 00:42:07.817]  They admit they're spraying barium salts and aluminum dioxide on us, and people just say, oh, that guy, he's a nut.
[00:42:07.817 --> 00:42:09.138]  Oh, yeah, they just admit they're doing it.
[00:42:09.138 --> 00:42:09.358]  I'm a nut.
[00:42:10.697 --> 00:42:14.263]  Hey, you like your little kids being sprayed with aluminum dioxide and barium salts?
[00:42:14.263 --> 00:42:16.287]  You like your kids being injected with mercury?
[00:42:16.287 --> 00:42:22.759]  You like sodium fluoride and hundreds of other chemicals they add to the water to brain damage you and sterilize your butt?
[00:42:22.759 --> 00:42:23.941]  You think that's cute and funny?
[00:42:31.044 --> 00:42:42.647]  I mean, I can't even get Austinites to admit that they're openly announcing that two major towns, and now five other towns are announcing behind them, that they're going to dump sewage directly in the water.
[00:42:42.647 --> 00:42:44.868]  And I read the type of sewage treatment.
[00:42:44.868 --> 00:42:54.491]  It's a light treatment where they just break up all the feces and urine and tampons and everything else that gets flushed down the toilet and all the toilet paper.
[00:42:54.491 --> 00:42:57.712]  And they grind it up and then they spew it out into the water.
[00:43:04.096 --> 00:43:04.656]  And why not?
[00:43:04.656 --> 00:43:09.379]  In Los Angeles, the water supply they give the public is toilet to tap.
[00:43:09.379 --> 00:43:21.285]  It all comes out of the sewage treatment plant, with hundreds and hundreds of chemicals added, tastes like gasoline, and then the feds give LA awards for the best water in the country.
[00:43:21.285 --> 00:43:28.569]  That's like walking up to somebody and shooting them ten times in the head with a .45 and then saying, I'm gonna give you an award for the best haircut.
[00:43:32.625 --> 00:43:37.606]  I mean, it's just total, we have a mass mentally ill society.
[00:43:37.606 --> 00:43:38.946]  And I go back to this analogy.
[00:43:38.946 --> 00:43:46.407]  I'm going to put this parable, this side-by-side comparison in the new Fall of the Republic we're going to have out next year.
[00:43:46.407 --> 00:43:49.908]  It's on eugenics.
[00:43:49.908 --> 00:43:52.368]  We've told you who the globalists are, what their plan is, what they're doing currently.
[00:43:52.368 --> 00:43:57.549]  The next one's going to show you just exactly what their final plan is and what they're currently up to with the eugenics.
[00:43:57.549 --> 00:44:01.770]  And you go back to Mesoamerica, the Toltecs, the Olmecs, the Aztecs.
[00:44:02.944 --> 00:44:26.210]  The entire Mayan society, if you teleported back in time, 2,000 years ago, 1,500 years ago, 600 years ago, pre-Cortes, and you teleport yourself back there, and this is the Mayan historians, this is the Mayan archaeologists, this isn't some propaganda, and they would sacrifice tens of thousands of people a year, sometimes thousands a day,
[00:44:27.691 --> 00:44:39.219]  They did it for population control, believing the gods were telling them that the earth was too populated and all the other sub-tribes who they would go out and capture and keep as slaves had to be killed and the gods needed blood.
[00:44:39.219 --> 00:44:42.502]  And they would sit there cutting their wives, their daughters, their children's hearts out.
[00:44:42.502 --> 00:44:45.424]  They didn't just kill their neighbors.
[00:44:45.424 --> 00:44:47.986]  They would kill the handsomest, the smartest, the tallest.
[00:44:47.986 --> 00:44:49.467]  That's why the people are so short down there.
[00:44:49.467 --> 00:44:50.708]  Nothing wrong being short.
[00:44:50.708 --> 00:44:51.168]  It's a fact.
[00:44:54.139 --> 00:45:04.202]  Then certain tribal characteristics of the priest class, of certain facial expressions, certain facial traits were the only people allowed to live.
[00:45:04.202 --> 00:45:08.604]  And so that's why you have that certain look of people down there.
[00:45:08.604 --> 00:45:22.308]  And if you teleported, if you time-machined, if you climbed in a time machine and went back 700 years to what's in Mexico City in that valley today, you would witness unholy hell-raiser Hades.
[00:45:23.703 --> 00:45:34.587]  The priest dragging strings with glass through their tongues and hallucinations of pain through their genitalia, hearts being cut out, blood spilling.
[00:45:34.587 --> 00:45:41.189]  And if you told them your culture's crazy and sick and wrong, they would say you were nuts.
[00:45:41.189 --> 00:45:46.830]  You know the old parable of the king, an evil witch came and poisoned the well to make the people evil and insane.
[00:45:46.830 --> 00:45:50.732]  And the wise king went and drank from the well so he would be insane as well.
[00:45:50.732 --> 00:45:51.592]  I don't think that's wisdom.
[00:45:56.124 --> 00:45:57.004]  And what am I supposed to do?
[00:45:57.004 --> 00:46:06.507]  Drink from the well and go, yeah, abortion and killing old people's good, and the cover of Newsweek saying the case for killing granny and how great it is to euthanize people, even if they don't want it.
[00:46:06.507 --> 00:46:11.188]  So it goes from, it's a right to kill yourself, to, oh, we're going to kill you.
[00:46:11.188 --> 00:46:17.130]  And, oh, it's good to take foster children and test poisons on them and drugs and pesticides on them.
[00:46:17.130 --> 00:46:18.270]  And, oh, it's good.
[00:46:18.270 --> 00:46:20.170]  And it's good to put sewage in the water.
[00:46:20.170 --> 00:46:22.231]  And, oh, you get an award for the best water.
[00:46:23.294 --> 00:46:28.657]  It's an insane, decadent, blasphemous system.
[00:46:28.657 --> 00:46:41.585]  Most of the churches are whorehouses, 501c3 whores.
[00:46:41.585 --> 00:46:50.110]  And it just gets worse and worse and worse and worse and worse.
[00:46:52.429 --> 00:46:54.070]  Until total insanity.
[00:46:54.070 --> 00:47:09.523]  Until nothing but black uniformed police and citizen spies are dragging people out of their houses and taking them to slave camps and shooting people in the back of the head and raping your women and forced abortions and forced injections and mass death all around us like Africa where some countries 44% have HIV.
[00:47:12.128 --> 00:47:31.216]  And they're just gonna slowly turn the heat up and slaughter everybody and cops are gonna love their petty authority and love giving people tickets and helping the CPS take kids and they're gonna trust the system when they get cancer at 45 and their wife dies at 30 and their kids get Alzheimer's when they're 20 and they're just gonna love and trust the system and go right to hell.
[00:47:34.073 --> 00:47:45.919]  The whole country, the whole world sliding in to a wonderland as the establishment turns our atmosphere, our cultural atmosphere, our spiritual atmosphere into hell.
[00:47:45.919 --> 00:47:48.321]  The earth is being turned into hell.
[00:47:48.321 --> 00:47:57.826]  The earth is being turned into upside-down poison where everything good is derided and pulled down and stomped on and trampled and everything evil
[00:47:59.292 --> 00:48:03.934]  Is risen up and exalted as goodness and exalted as beauty.
[00:48:03.934 --> 00:48:09.937]  I'm going to come back and go to your calls and then do a news blitz.
[00:48:09.937 --> 00:48:11.697]  I'll get into that actually big news blitz.
[00:48:11.697 --> 00:48:13.318]  I'll do news blitz at 8 after next hour.
[00:48:13.318 --> 00:48:14.939]  I do want to continue with your calls at 1-800-259-9231.
[00:48:22.699 --> 00:48:33.822]  I do want to thank all the listeners that have gotten Fall of the Republic and who are feverishly making copies of the DVD that they ordered from the online video bookstore at Infowars.com.
[00:48:33.822 --> 00:48:48.767]  I want to thank everybody that's a PrisonPlanet.tv member who watches the live TV show and downloads and shares it with friends and who share all the other films that are in the highest online quality at PrisonPlanet.tv who are ripping the DivX copy from the site and giving it to everyone they know.
[00:48:51.283 --> 00:48:53.664]  And I just want to encourage you with the copies you've got.
[00:48:53.664 --> 00:48:55.365]  Please go put it on local access.
[00:48:55.365 --> 00:48:56.426]  Jump through the hoops to do it.
[00:48:56.426 --> 00:49:01.048]  You'll reach thousands in small towns, hundreds of thousands in big cities.
[00:49:01.048 --> 00:49:03.789]  Please, don't just make a hundred copies.
[00:49:03.789 --> 00:49:06.871]  Say you're going to make a hundred copies a week for the next six months.
[00:49:06.871 --> 00:49:07.951]  Get aggressive.
[00:49:07.951 --> 00:49:09.292]  Have a garage sale.
[00:49:09.292 --> 00:49:10.552]  Have an eBay sale.
[00:49:10.552 --> 00:49:11.913]  Sell all the crap you've got.
[00:49:11.913 --> 00:49:13.554]  Those baseball cards that don't matter.
[00:49:15.293 --> 00:49:18.134]  Make copies, get DVD burners, get aggressive.
[00:49:18.134 --> 00:49:22.095]  We can bring these people down if we can just show them what's really happening.
[00:49:22.095 --> 00:49:24.036]  Because a lot of people aren't still going to listen.
[00:49:24.036 --> 00:49:25.856]  A lot are waking up and will listen now.
[00:49:25.856 --> 00:49:43.162]  But a lot of others will see the film, poo-poo a lot of it, but later as the tyranny sets in on them, and later when we're off the air and things are a lot darker in the future, and no doubt things continue down this line, we won't be on the air within 5-10 years, maybe even sooner.
[00:49:45.063 --> 00:49:55.950]  People will remember what they saw, and these films will be even more important then than they are today, because they will be... They're not pressing it, we're reading their playbook.
[00:49:55.950 --> 00:49:58.492]  People are asking, Coach, how do you know what their next play is?
[00:49:58.492 --> 00:49:59.372]  How do you do it?
[00:49:59.372 --> 00:50:00.493]  I got their playbook right here.
[00:50:00.493 --> 00:50:04.356]  I know what their call signs are.
[00:50:04.356 --> 00:50:05.376]  Okay, see the other coach?
[00:50:05.376 --> 00:50:10.980]  He just gave... He just gave the order for a Hail Mary pass.
[00:50:10.980 --> 00:50:12.961]  They're gonna go deep with a 30-yard, 40-yard pass.
[00:50:14.411 --> 00:50:15.834]  And then they do a 40-yard pass.
[00:50:15.834 --> 00:50:17.759]  I mean, I know what they're doing.
[00:50:17.759 --> 00:50:18.781]  I know when they're going to kick.
[00:50:18.781 --> 00:50:21.066]  I know their game plan.
[00:50:21.066 --> 00:50:22.049]  It's all stated.
[00:50:22.049 --> 00:50:22.650]  It's all public.
[00:50:23.732 --> 00:50:32.737]  And a big chunk of the game plan is in Fall of the Republic available at InfoWars.com or by calling toll free 888-253-3139.
[00:50:32.737 --> 00:50:33.477]  Please don't wait.

[00:50:48.044 --> 00:50:54.835]  And allows us to have the capital to continue and expand in these hard times as things get worse and worse.
[00:50:54.835 --> 00:50:55.956]  We'll be right back.
[00:50:55.956 --> 00:50:58.160]  Continue with your phone calls on the other side.
[00:50:58.160 --> 00:50:59.282]  And a big news blitz coming up.
[00:51:01.946 --> 00:51:07.808]  How many times have you been in a situation where having a hidden audio or video recorder would have made a difference in your life?
[00:51:07.808 --> 00:51:12.950]  In the past, owning a hidden video recorder has been expensive and too much of a bother to carry.
[00:51:12.950 --> 00:51:13.570]  That was then.
[00:51:13.570 --> 00:51:15.451]  This is now.
[00:51:15.451 --> 00:51:17.632]  Introducing Diginet Spy Sunglasses.
[00:51:18.172 --> 00:51:24.235]  These sunglasses contain a small hidden camera that will record up to four hours of real-time audio and video.
[00:51:24.235 --> 00:51:33.459]  The DigiNet sunglasses are perfect for traffic stops, on lawful searches and seizures, town hall meetings, proving your innocence, or any other situation you'd like to record.
[00:51:33.459 --> 00:51:36.201]  And if sunglasses aren't for you, check out the DigiPen.
[00:51:36.901 --> 00:51:41.385]  It does the same great job as the sunglasses, but in the form of a functional pen.
[00:51:41.385 --> 00:51:42.907]  Video never lies.
[00:51:42.907 --> 00:51:44.568]  Watch Big Brother back.
[00:51:44.568 --> 00:51:46.350]  Visit Diginet.net.
[00:51:46.350 --> 00:51:49.332]  That's D-I-G-A-N-E-T dot net.
[00:51:49.332 --> 00:51:51.935]  D-I-G-A-N-E-T dot net.
[00:51:51.935 --> 00:51:53.616]  Diginet dot net.

[00:51:54.237 --> 00:51:54.537]  1-888-344-6681 today.
[00:52:03.240 --> 00:52:07.266]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:52:07.266 --> 00:52:10.511]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:52:10.511 --> 00:52:15.278]  As we're finishing off this agenda, we're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:52:15.720 --> 00:52:21.686]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:52:21.686 --> 00:52:26.891]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[00:52:26.891 --> 00:52:36.880]  Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[00:52:36.980 --> 00:52:39.321]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[00:52:39.321 --> 00:52:40.922]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:52:40.922 --> 00:52:43.384]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:52:43.384 --> 00:52:45.505]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[00:52:45.505 --> 00:52:50.647]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[00:52:50.647 --> 00:52:55.650]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com.
[00:52:55.650 --> 00:52:59.772]  Or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:53:02.065 --> 00:53:05.428]  When you hear the words water purification, what comes to mind?
[00:53:05.428 --> 00:53:09.332]  If it's Berkey Water Purification Systems, this message is for you.
[00:53:09.332 --> 00:53:13.075]  Did you know that over 60% of municipal water contains fluoride?
[00:53:13.075 --> 00:53:19.541]  At less than $0.02 per gallon, Berkey water filters purify treated and untreated water, remove dangerous chlorine,
[00:53:21.561 --> 00:53:21.881]  I think so.
[00:53:46.309 --> 00:53:49.271]  And ship all orders over $50 free of charge.
[00:53:49.271 --> 00:53:51.813]  Visit BigBerkeyWaterFilters.com.

[00:53:53.774 --> 00:53:54.575]  Or call 1-877-99-BERKEY.
[00:53:54.575 --> 00:53:55.175]  That's 1-877-99-BERKEY.
[00:54:13.058 --> 00:54:41.602]  If you would have teleported back 1,000, 1,500 years ago to Druidic England and you watched the chief's son being given mead to get him drunk and then being put on his knees and having his brains bashed out with jewels hanging off of his body and thrown into a peat bog so that the harvest would be good that year, you'd try to tell
[00:54:42.628 --> 00:54:47.611]  The Druids, that it was insane what they were doing, that it was stupid.
[00:54:47.611 --> 00:54:49.373]  And they would think that you were a lunatic.
[00:54:49.373 --> 00:54:51.294]  Same thing with the Aztecs.
[00:54:51.294 --> 00:54:52.855]  And it's the same thing today.
[00:54:52.855 --> 00:54:54.636]  People think sewage water is good to drink.
[00:54:54.636 --> 00:54:59.940]  They think hundreds of poisons put in the water supply under the name fluoride is good.
[00:54:59.940 --> 00:55:01.761]  They think world government is good.
[00:55:01.761 --> 00:55:06.264]  They don't say, wait, the media denied world government all these decades and now admits it.
[00:55:06.264 --> 00:55:08.265]  They go, no, I want world government.
[00:55:08.265 --> 00:55:09.786]  I want a carbon tax.
[00:55:09.786 --> 00:55:10.647]  I want to be a slave.
[00:55:11.587 --> 00:55:13.008]  But a lot of people don't.
[00:55:13.008 --> 00:55:16.391]  But the media says we are the insane ones.
[00:55:16.391 --> 00:55:23.096]  Just like if you were in Nazi Germany in 1940 and said, I don't like Hitler, they would arrest you and say you were insane.
[00:55:23.096 --> 00:55:25.258]  John in Illinois, you're on the air.
[00:55:25.258 --> 00:55:28.240]  Go ahead.
[00:55:28.240 --> 00:55:30.562]  Alex, first, we are Change Here Chicago.
[00:55:30.562 --> 00:55:31.903]  First, an item of business.
[00:55:31.903 --> 00:55:36.307]  Since Sunday, the podcast hasn't been serving up for some reason.
[00:55:37.370 --> 00:55:40.132]  iTunes claims it's on your end, but what the hell do I know?
[00:55:40.132 --> 00:55:44.876]  Okay, let me ask the IT guys.
[00:55:44.876 --> 00:55:52.901]  Do we know what's going on with the podcast, or is that a service we're not going to offer anymore?
[00:55:52.901 --> 00:55:54.042]  Yeah, we're trying to fix it.
[00:55:54.042 --> 00:55:56.124]  Again, I need to hire an extra IT person.
[00:55:56.124 --> 00:55:58.025]  The two guys I got are overwhelmed.
[00:55:58.025 --> 00:55:59.206]  That takes money.
[00:55:59.206 --> 00:56:04.450]  Then I've got to sit here and harangue people with products, because we're not funded by David Rockefeller, but we'll try to get that up for you.
[00:56:05.134 --> 00:56:06.454]  Okay, second item.
[00:56:06.454 --> 00:56:11.456]  On September 19th, me and another member of We Are Change confronted Richard Dreyfuss.
[00:56:11.456 --> 00:56:22.340]  He was appearing at a local movie theater, showing his films to promote his own personal charity of teaching civics to school children.
[00:56:22.340 --> 00:56:33.204]  And when I finally got up to Richard, I was wearing a big button of my cousin who was killed in the North Tower, and I asked him if he would support Charlie Sheen's call for a new investigation.
[00:56:34.349 --> 00:56:37.551]  And he cut me off and he said, can I tell you something?
[00:56:37.551 --> 00:56:44.054]  And I said, yes, we got to wait at least a generation before we investigate this.
[00:56:44.054 --> 00:56:44.815]  And I said, why?
[00:56:44.815 --> 00:56:54.200]  And then he started going into the civil war, why we couldn't have a Lincoln Memorial until 40 years after the civil war ended.
[00:56:54.200 --> 00:56:55.800]  Nothing made any sense.
[00:56:55.800 --> 00:56:57.781]  We got it on YouTube.
[00:56:57.781 --> 00:56:59.943]  It's called Richard Dreyfuss confronted on 9, 11,
[00:57:01.178 --> 00:57:01.839]  About 9-11.
[00:57:01.839 --> 00:57:03.740]  Well, let me say this.
[00:57:03.740 --> 00:57:21.813]  We Are Change, going and confronting politicians, something I pioneered because we had the internet at the time, it had just developed in the mid-90s to become popular, to go out and confront governors and politicians and the drug czar and Janet Reno.
[00:57:21.813 --> 00:57:26.297]  The way We Are Change, especially Chicago and LA and New York,
[00:57:27.057 --> 00:57:38.502]  And all over the world, people are going and confronting politicians and media people and movie stars, and every time you do it, hundreds of thousands of people, bare minimum, see it.
[00:57:38.502 --> 00:57:42.163]  You are revolutionizing things, and I want to commend what you're doing.
[00:57:42.163 --> 00:57:55.289]  Okay, well, we haven't had that many views on that video, but I want to ask everybody out there, we aren't changing anybody else, if they could please view the video, and if Richard Dreyfuss comes to your city to promote this charity,
[00:57:56.227 --> 00:58:00.248]  Uh, to teach civics to school children, to confront him.
[00:58:00.248 --> 00:58:03.429]  Why do we, you're promoting civics, Richard.
[00:58:03.429 --> 00:58:05.270]  Why can't we have answers?
[00:58:05.270 --> 00:58:07.711]  I would like to see, I would like to see the civics.
[00:58:07.711 --> 00:58:18.414]  I bet it's this, uh, civicsoid type garbage they're teaching about civics means turn your guns in, worship government.
[00:58:18.414 --> 00:58:25.016]  I'm with you, but Richard Dreyfuss, he's totally captured by these people and he was discussing with the person in front of us
[00:58:25.757 --> 00:58:29.279]  As he was leaving, he says, may God and the angels bless you.
[00:58:29.279 --> 00:58:32.721]  And Richard says, and Lucifer too!
[00:58:32.721 --> 00:58:34.001]  You're kidding.
[00:58:34.001 --> 00:58:34.542]  No!
[00:58:34.542 --> 00:58:36.783]  This is on video.
[00:58:36.783 --> 00:58:37.943]  We didn't get that part.
[00:58:37.943 --> 00:58:38.824]  I gotta go.
[00:58:38.824 --> 00:58:40.845]  Good job.

[00:59:55.899 --> 01:00:05.264]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:05.264 --> 01:00:05.844]  Big Brother.
[01:00:06.562 --> 01:00:08.323]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:08.323 --> 01:00:10.064]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:10.064 --> 01:00:11.665]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.665 --> 01:00:13.206]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.206 --> 01:00:17.408]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.408 --> 01:00:21.471]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:35.677 --> 01:00:36.318]  How's it going Alex?
[01:00:36.318 --> 01:00:38.239]  Actually I was looking on YouTube and I saw
[01:01:00.976 --> 01:01:06.020]  A video about a classified swine flu martial law plan and it has representative John Haller.
[01:01:06.020 --> 01:01:11.784]  And he's talking about this martial law plan, how they're going to redo the Bill of Rights, and how they're going to do everything.
[01:01:11.784 --> 01:01:12.665]  Just redo everything.
[01:01:12.665 --> 01:01:16.308]  Oh wait, this was to take effect and change and whatnot.
[01:01:16.308 --> 01:01:20.611]  Excuse me, this is a federal congressman saying this?
[01:01:20.611 --> 01:01:22.793]  Yeah, representative John Haller.
[01:01:22.793 --> 01:01:24.154]  I just actually saw this morning.
[01:01:24.154 --> 01:01:30.539]  It says, the topic of it says classified swine flu martial law plan.
[01:01:31.345 --> 01:01:32.866]  Okay, let me stop you, let me stop you.
[01:01:32.866 --> 01:01:34.046]  Is it on YouTube?
[01:01:34.046 --> 01:01:35.988]  It's on YouTube right now.
[01:01:35.988 --> 01:01:46.133]  Okay, now I'm going to write down the headline again, and guys, to the crew out there, I need you to write this down, because I want to find this on YouTube.
[01:01:46.133 --> 01:01:49.215]  It's, what's the title?
[01:01:49.215 --> 01:01:53.477]  Classified Swine Flu Martial Law Plan.
[01:01:57.762 --> 01:02:00.583]  Excuse me, is this a congressman on C-SPAN or where is this from?
[01:02:00.583 --> 01:02:01.023]  On C-SPAN, yeah.
[01:02:18.320 --> 01:02:29.208]  Well, you know under level six and under the executive order it states they can't have martial law, mass roundups, mass arrest, forced quarantines, forced injections.
[01:02:29.208 --> 01:02:31.550]  But you're saying, where is this congressman from?
[01:02:31.550 --> 01:02:35.733]  Pennsylvania, 12th district.
[01:02:35.733 --> 01:02:37.975]  12th district.
[01:02:37.975 --> 01:02:39.335]  I don't have to say get him on guys.
[01:02:39.335 --> 01:02:43.418]  12th district, Pennsylvania.
[01:02:43.418 --> 01:02:45.220]  And how do you pronounce his name again?
[01:02:46.551 --> 01:02:47.834]  Uh, John Haller.
[01:02:47.834 --> 01:02:50.358]  H-A-L-L-E-R.
[01:02:50.358 --> 01:02:52.782]  Okay, yeah, that's... that's the onion, sir.
[01:02:55.075 --> 01:03:08.639]  And I'm not mad at you, I'm not saying you're bad, but the name rung a bell, and what The Onion does, whether on purpose or not, is they put out very similar headlines and videos, and they're now nationwide, they're in most big cities.
[01:03:08.639 --> 01:03:23.724]  It's a fake newspaper, but they mirror what's really going on, and then every time I talk about all the real congressmen I had on, about how they were threatened with martial law last year, if they didn't hand over
[01:03:25.029 --> 01:03:30.570]  Full control of the foreign banks over the issuance of currency and credit that there would be martial law.
[01:03:30.570 --> 01:03:43.393]  So now when I have Congressman Ron Paul and Senator Inhofe went public and many others on about this, I'm having one of those memory slips.
[01:03:43.393 --> 01:03:43.573]  Who?
[01:03:43.573 --> 01:03:46.314]  No, it wasn't Alan Grayson.
[01:03:46.314 --> 01:03:50.095]  Who was the other congressman who originally, he's in my, who?
[01:03:52.128 --> 01:03:54.168]  Yes, Brad Sherman, that's it, from California.
[01:03:54.168 --> 01:03:57.209]  We even had him on the show that they were threatened with martial law.
[01:03:57.209 --> 01:04:05.711]  I get emails every week that I see trying to scan through them and see comments on YouTube going, Alex Jones is the one that put out the fake Onion video.
[01:04:05.711 --> 01:04:09.432]  Alex Jones is the one that said that Congress called for martial law.
[01:04:09.432 --> 01:04:11.932]  So do you see how they operate?
[01:04:11.932 --> 01:04:14.313]  I can have Paul on.
[01:04:14.313 --> 01:04:18.093]  We can have cover the Inhofe statements to the media.
[01:04:18.093 --> 01:04:20.714]  We can have other congressmen on.
[01:04:21.553 --> 01:04:23.294]  They don't care.
[01:04:23.294 --> 01:04:24.714]  They do straw men.
[01:04:24.714 --> 01:04:31.396]  They also go out on the web and say that I'm saying space aliens are landing, and that I'm saying all these things I never said.
[01:04:31.396 --> 01:04:32.557]  That's a straw man.
[01:04:32.557 --> 01:04:34.197]  But I'm not criticizing you.
[01:04:34.197 --> 01:04:35.017]  You took the bait.
[01:04:35.017 --> 01:04:46.001]  It's made to look like C-SPAN, but it's Onion-SPAN of you, and it's representative John Haller, Republican Pennsylvania 12th District, totally and completely fake.
[01:04:46.952 --> 01:04:49.855]  And put out after real congressmen went public.
[01:04:49.855 --> 01:04:51.677]  That's how the New World Order rolls.
[01:04:51.677 --> 01:04:59.685]  And they put classified swine flu, martial law plan, done by design, to discredit everything.
[01:05:00.285 --> 01:05:04.847]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:05:04.847 --> 01:05:05.748]  Number one.
[01:05:05.748 --> 01:05:09.190]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:05:09.190 --> 01:05:10.050]  Number two.
[01:05:10.050 --> 01:05:14.933]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:05:14.933 --> 01:05:15.673]  It's true.
[01:05:15.673 --> 01:05:20.556]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:05:20.556 --> 01:05:21.376]  Number three.
[01:05:21.376 --> 01:05:24.958]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:05:24.958 --> 01:05:28.660]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:05:28.860 --> 01:05:32.421]  Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:05:32.421 --> 01:05:36.102]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:05:36.102 --> 01:05:41.043]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:05:41.043 --> 01:05:46.085]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:05:46.085 --> 01:05:50.266]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:05:50.266 --> 01:05:52.047]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[01:05:52.047 --> 01:05:56.648]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com, or call 1-866-422-9000.

[01:06:00.210 --> 01:06:07.956]  Have you heard that millionaire, entrepreneur, businessman, your congressional candidate, and author Robert Beatles wrote a new book called Here's What You Do?
[01:06:07.956 --> 01:06:14.040]  You can buy it at here'swhatyoudo.net as an e-book for six bucks or the book for ten bucks.
[01:06:14.040 --> 01:06:17.002]  And we have an audio book on its way for you commuters as well.
[01:06:17.002 --> 01:06:22.886]  Here's What You Do tells you exactly what to do to survive and thrive in these harsh economic times.
[01:06:23.246 --> 01:06:24.847]  This book will work for anyone.
[01:06:24.847 --> 01:06:27.328]  Rich, poor, middle class, it doesn't matter.
[01:06:27.328 --> 01:06:32.951]  This book truly has the information that can make you wealthy and it will tell you how to protect your wealth as well.
[01:06:32.951 --> 01:06:35.032]  You know the government isn't looking out for you.
[01:06:35.032 --> 01:06:36.792]  You need to look out for yourself.
[01:06:36.792 --> 01:06:39.314]  The economy is bad, but it's probably going to get worse.
[01:06:39.314 --> 01:06:44.036]  You must prepare and make sure you are able to financially take care of yourself and your loved ones.
[01:06:44.036 --> 01:06:47.738]  Go to hereiswhatyoudo.net and start today.
[01:06:47.738 --> 01:06:49.899]  Again, it is hereiswhatyoudo.net.
[01:06:50.859 --> 01:06:52.760]  That's hereiswhatyoudo.net.
[01:06:52.760 --> 01:07:02.003]  One last time, it's hereiswhatyoudo.net.
[01:07:02.003 --> 01:07:06.044]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:07:06.044 --> 01:07:09.265]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:07:09.265 --> 01:07:14.087]  As they're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home.
[01:07:14.087 --> 01:07:17.928]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress.
[01:07:18.570 --> 01:07:20.452]  And they really are calling the shots.
[01:07:20.452 --> 01:07:25.437]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[01:07:35.768 --> 01:07:38.108]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[01:07:38.108 --> 01:07:39.689]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:07:39.689 --> 01:07:42.149]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:07:42.149 --> 01:07:44.270]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[01:07:44.270 --> 01:07:49.411]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[01:07:49.411 --> 01:07:54.432]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com.

[01:08:10.422 --> 01:08:12.003]  You want answers?
[01:08:12.003 --> 01:08:12.923]  Well, so does he.
[01:08:12.923 --> 01:08:17.747]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:17.747 --> 01:08:24.932]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:08:24.932 --> 01:08:32.177]  We are continuing with open phones today, coming up in about 25 minutes.
[01:08:32.177 --> 01:08:32.618]  We have
[01:08:34.173 --> 01:08:40.218]  Tim Baldwin, son of Chuck Baldwin, joining us about a very informative article about the history of our republic.
[01:08:40.218 --> 01:08:42.040]  Joining us.
[01:08:42.040 --> 01:08:45.202]  Then Lindsey Williams is coming on for a full hour.
[01:08:45.202 --> 01:08:46.864]  But it's only going to be phone calls.
[01:08:46.864 --> 01:08:48.545]  One phone call after the other.
[01:08:48.545 --> 01:08:53.029]  I'm going to do a news blitz here in just a moment.
[01:08:53.029 --> 01:08:56.332]  But first, let's run through four or five more calls quickly.
[01:08:56.332 --> 01:08:58.514]  David in Ohio, you're on the air.
[01:08:59.847 --> 01:09:01.729]  Yes sir, I'd like your input on this.
[01:09:01.729 --> 01:09:13.602]  I've been looking at the proper order to purpose structure and I come up with things are either planned, things can happen by accident, or things are experimental.
[01:09:13.602 --> 01:09:18.247]  Is there anything else to that line of thinking?
[01:09:19.215 --> 01:09:35.009]  Well, that's in the realm of human activity, then there's nature, both on terra firma, in the atmosphere, and then from space, meteor impacts, comets, solar radiation, fluctuations in the sun, dealing with weather.
[01:09:35.009 --> 01:09:44.256]  The sun is the greatest driver and arbiter of things non-human, but we spring from the life-giving energies of the sun, supplied to us by the Creator.
[01:09:45.477 --> 01:09:59.269]  But I agree with you and the establishment has chaos models where they can even predict major trends in human society and development that's what most of their surveillance grids and psychological algorithm
[01:10:00.578 --> 01:10:16.519]  Profiles that they garner from Google and Tevo and the cable systems and your cell phones and the NSA tapping is so they can predict random chaos models and find order in the chaos and so they can set up systems
[01:10:17.611 --> 01:10:31.134]  To get more power out of naturally occurring crises, and this is declassified that they do this, but then also they will trigger their own crises, provocateur crises, or purely carry out crises.
[01:10:31.134 --> 01:10:37.516]  And so this is what the social engineers are into, and they point out that they are the humans that are involved in this.
[01:10:37.516 --> 01:10:40.097]  They're the humans that care about this.
[01:10:40.097 --> 01:10:40.957]  They are the people that
[01:10:42.324 --> 01:10:44.608]  Have their business together and are focused.
[01:10:44.608 --> 01:10:50.638]  They also have to be very cold-blooded, very controlling and just horrible control freaks.
[01:10:50.638 --> 01:10:54.084]  And because good people who are just as intelligent, but
[01:10:56.032 --> 01:10:58.713]  Well actually what I was trying to do is come up with a very easy
[01:11:25.649 --> 01:11:26.249]  Absolutely.
[01:11:26.249 --> 01:11:28.331]  You have to vote on conscience and on morals.
[01:11:45.481 --> 01:11:51.805]  You have to vote on what's right, but people like to feel like it's a football team or baseball team.
[01:11:51.805 --> 01:11:53.206]  They want to have the bandwagon.
[01:11:53.206 --> 01:11:56.367]  They want to vote for the winner, George Bush, in 2001, 2000.
[01:11:56.367 --> 01:12:01.050]  They want to vote for the winner, Barack Obama, in 2008.
[01:12:01.050 --> 01:12:04.672]  They want to feel like they're part of the power structure.
[01:12:04.672 --> 01:12:10.376]  And so many of these fake churches and good old boys and mainline liberals and mainline conservatives, they are drunk
[01:12:11.397 --> 01:12:21.369]  Kind of how, you know, I looked at the banking thing.
[01:12:21.369 --> 01:12:26.475]  People's will was to have credit and more, but they never saw credit leads to receivership.
[01:12:27.776 --> 01:12:34.541]  And they never understood that the credit economy is run by a parasitic banking structure that creates fake paper.
[01:12:34.541 --> 01:12:45.849]  So how does a group with fake, made-up, unlimited fiat paper, how do they get control of a society when the society has real, tangible property, intellectual ideas, and labor?
[01:12:45.849 --> 01:12:48.931]  They create an economic structure where it is impossible
[01:12:49.511 --> 01:12:52.212]  to operate outside of the credit paradigm.
[01:12:52.212 --> 01:13:04.857]  They deindustrialize, they bankrupt, they tax, they regulate so that you are forced by wrecking the ship of society onto the wreckage of the ship that is the government to now serve them.
[01:13:04.857 --> 01:13:09.898]  Then they can remold society in the image that they wish to create.
[01:13:09.898 --> 01:13:13.960]  This is the heart of the spirit and the mindset of our adversary.
[01:13:14.656 --> 01:13:25.465]  Yeah, with this debt-based economy, even if everyone was allowed to bank 30% or could bank on what they made, the country would still run in debt because they're paying interest on the full amount of money printed.
[01:13:25.465 --> 01:13:26.706]  Yes.
[01:13:26.706 --> 01:13:28.147]  Yes.
[01:13:28.147 --> 01:13:29.067]  Thank you, sir.
[01:13:29.067 --> 01:13:29.648]  Well said.
[01:13:29.648 --> 01:13:30.328]  Very well said.
[01:13:30.328 --> 01:13:33.651]  I lose track of college.
[01:13:33.651 --> 01:13:34.592]  Was that Lewis or David?
[01:13:38.334 --> 01:13:38.754]  Okay, good.
[01:13:38.754 --> 01:13:39.475]  That's what I thought it was.
[01:13:39.475 --> 01:13:40.315]  Thank you, David.
[01:13:40.315 --> 01:13:53.600]  We're going to go to Bill, Eric, and Skip, then I'm going to do a little news blitz here, and then more in the next hour, because Williams is staggered at the end of the third hour, half of the third hour, and the first half of the fourth hour today.
[01:13:53.600 --> 01:13:57.102]  So two news blitzes I'm going to be doing here.
[01:13:57.102 --> 01:14:01.764]  You see, the creator of the universe, whether you believe in the creator or not, the laws of the universe
[01:14:02.990 --> 01:14:11.753]  Is about freedom and liberty and building and construction and brotherhood and love and all that's rewarding and all that's good.
[01:14:11.753 --> 01:14:18.455]  That's what springs from our basic programming.
[01:14:18.455 --> 01:14:20.556]  Where truth is honored.
[01:14:20.556 --> 01:14:23.437]  Where honor is number one.
[01:14:24.517 --> 01:14:37.006]  When your family is number one, when doing the right thing is number one, when being true, true blue, when people know you can be counted on, that is the greatest wealth.
[01:14:37.006 --> 01:14:47.074]  But they take that away and sell you debt and disease and weakness and lies and fraud and mental illness.
[01:14:47.074 --> 01:14:50.477]  Bill in Ohio, you're on the air.
[01:14:50.477 --> 01:14:51.778]  How's it going Alex?
[01:14:51.778 --> 01:14:52.098]  Good sir.
[01:14:53.061 --> 01:14:56.683]  Hey, you opened my eyes up about a year and a half ago, and I just want to say God bless you, man.
[01:14:56.683 --> 01:14:57.703]  I appreciate it.
[01:14:57.703 --> 01:14:59.864]  God bless you!
[01:14:59.864 --> 01:15:01.905]  I've got a quick story for ya.
[01:15:01.905 --> 01:15:06.387]  I, uh, I stopped a mosquito truck that was running down my street spraying chemicals in the air.
[01:15:06.387 --> 01:15:09.128]  Oh yeah, that's bad stuff.
[01:15:09.128 --> 01:15:18.432]  Yeah, and I asked them, you know, if they could show me a sheet, if, uh, what they were spraying in the air, and, uh, the girl just kept telling me, back away from the car, sir, or I'm gonna call the police.
[01:15:19.375 --> 01:15:21.257]  I was like, what are you talking about?
[01:15:21.257 --> 01:15:22.498]  I'm just trying to ask you a question.
[01:15:36.773 --> 01:15:43.457]  Eating krill and shrimp and worms and smaller fish that were coming out of rivers into the ocean.
[01:15:43.457 --> 01:15:48.160]  So it did really mess up pelicans and eagles and things like that that eat fish.
[01:15:48.160 --> 01:15:55.424]  But DDT, I've looked at the molecular makeup, I've interviewed toxicologists on the show, and there have been many books written on the subject.
[01:15:55.424 --> 01:16:01.787]  DDT is much less toxic to humans than the new chemicals they spray.
[01:16:01.787 --> 01:16:02.648]  And I got home
[01:16:04.212 --> 01:16:11.955]  About five and a half years ago, it was right after my grandmother had died, I remember, and I got home at about 3 a.m.
[01:16:11.955 --> 01:16:17.238]  from editing at the office, and a Cessna flew over at about 250 feet.
[01:16:17.238 --> 01:16:21.920]  I thought it was dangerously low at some of the big high-tension wires that were nearby.
[01:16:21.920 --> 01:16:24.901]  I believe it was illegal, unless they got an FAA waiver.
[01:16:24.901 --> 01:16:29.563]  And it had spray nozzles spraying a cloud, and I sat there to smell it, because I wanted to know what they were spraying.
[01:16:31.550 --> 01:16:34.732]  Curiosity killed the cat and it was a chemical.
[01:16:34.732 --> 01:16:43.296]  And I went inside and I search-engined Aerial Spraying Insect Eradication, Austin, Texas.
[01:16:43.296 --> 01:16:52.960]  And sure enough, they had a year-long contract for during the spring, summer, and fall to spray for some type of Chinese moth.
[01:16:54.332 --> 01:17:02.494]  And I read what the chemical was, very poisonous to humans, and just so happens to be associated with infertility in mammals.
[01:17:02.494 --> 01:17:14.577]  So how the globalists operate is, there are thousands of pesticides, and they'll pick the pesticides that interfere with human reproduction.
[01:17:14.577 --> 01:17:17.358]  And then it's hidden in plain view, the guy spraying it doesn't know.
[01:17:18.237 --> 01:17:23.844]  And then I tried to tell people on air about the spring and they laughed and giggled, but absolutely.
[01:17:23.844 --> 01:17:28.449]  I've been down at Port Aransas and this truck drives around at like 10 p.m.
[01:17:28.449 --> 01:17:34.256]  almost every time I'm down there if I go out to the 7-Eleven or whatever, or the local, it's not 7-Eleven, it's Stripes.
[01:17:34.997 --> 01:17:36.638]  You know, to buy some milk or whatever.
[01:17:36.638 --> 01:17:40.500]  My wife would be like, oh the kids are asleep, we forgot milk, go get some.
[01:17:40.500 --> 01:17:42.061]  And you know, eggs for breakfast.
[01:17:42.061 --> 01:17:47.064]  And I'd see the trucks driving around and boy, does it stink when you smell that poison.
[01:17:47.064 --> 01:17:49.526]  What was your other comment on that subject?
[01:17:49.526 --> 01:17:54.909]  Well actually now the county is now bringing me to court and putting charges against me.
[01:17:54.909 --> 01:18:02.053]  Fourth degree misdemeanor for enticing and trying to fight with a mosquito truck driver when all I was doing was asking questions.
[01:18:02.742 --> 01:18:04.264]  Oh, so see, it goes further.
[01:18:04.264 --> 01:18:07.007]  The person's on a power trip.
[01:18:07.007 --> 01:18:14.835]  Well, listen, listen, you just get a jury trial and you let them know you're going to sue them and you sue the individual for filing a false report.
[01:18:14.835 --> 01:18:16.337]  Doesn't matter if they win or not.
[01:18:16.337 --> 01:18:18.819]  You just sue them, then they're going to have to respond.
[01:18:18.819 --> 01:18:20.641]  They think you're just there to be a victim.
[01:18:20.641 --> 01:18:21.862]  Give them some of their own medicine.
[01:18:22.823 --> 01:18:29.187]  And call them in and say, did I just talk to you and you said get back from the truck?
[01:18:29.187 --> 01:18:32.108]  And you know, it's my right to ask what you're spraying.
[01:18:32.108 --> 01:18:33.609]  But see, they got all these new prisons.
[01:18:33.609 --> 01:18:35.710]  They gotta put people in them.
[01:18:35.710 --> 01:18:39.192]  And so that's why they're going after you.
[01:18:39.192 --> 01:18:41.594]  So, I mean, how did this end?
[01:18:41.594 --> 01:18:43.655]  The police came?
[01:18:43.655 --> 01:18:49.078]  No, the cops never showed up, but I had to go make a statement at the police department
[01:18:49.716 --> 01:18:54.321]  And even the cops said the county's been calling me like five times trying to put this thing through trial.
[01:18:54.321 --> 01:18:54.661]  He's like...
[01:18:55.185 --> 01:18:56.066]  This is crazy.
[01:18:56.066 --> 01:18:58.467]  Like, there's no evidence of any kind.
[01:18:58.467 --> 01:19:00.068]  Yeah, he's not going to rise through the ranks.
[01:19:00.068 --> 01:19:02.790]  They'll get rid of him and hire some felon or something.
[01:19:02.790 --> 01:19:07.433]  Or, you know, he'll end up washing police cars out back.
[01:19:07.433 --> 01:19:08.474]  I mean, this is insane.
[01:19:08.474 --> 01:19:11.376]  But, sir, I see articles like this in the news.
[01:19:11.376 --> 01:19:17.741]  I see articles every week where police come and arrest people for flying upside down American flags.
[01:19:17.741 --> 01:19:19.161]  They think it's illegal.
[01:19:19.161 --> 01:19:20.182]  When you're supposed to fly it.
[01:19:20.182 --> 01:19:22.384]  If the country isn't in crisis, I don't know when it ever will be.
[01:19:23.337 --> 01:19:30.524]  So I guess you walked back in your house and this control freak wrote the number down.
[01:19:30.524 --> 01:19:34.347]  Well, evidently I'm going next week for the trial.
[01:19:34.347 --> 01:19:38.050]  But I just thought, you know, it's my duty as an American to stand up and ask questions, you know?
[01:19:38.050 --> 01:19:40.693]  What is this Wicked counting?
[01:19:40.693 --> 01:19:42.715]  Lake County.
[01:19:42.715 --> 01:19:42.855]  Yeah.
[01:19:44.466 --> 01:19:53.876]  Hey man, I saw police bite old women coming out of shops with grocery bags with police dogs, and when the old women complained, they went ahead and arrested them and charged them.
[01:19:53.876 --> 01:19:55.738]  Those old women's lives are over.
[01:19:55.738 --> 01:19:59.162]  They'll definitely be paying most of their money to the probation man.
[01:20:00.677 --> 01:20:05.224]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:20:05.224 --> 01:20:09.570]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:20:09.570 --> 01:20:15.318]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:20:15.318 --> 01:20:15.759]  It's true.
[01:20:16.039 --> 01:20:21.741]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:20:21.741 --> 01:20:25.322]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:20:25.322 --> 01:20:30.043]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:20:30.043 --> 01:20:32.804]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:20:32.804 --> 01:20:36.125]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:20:37.265 --> 01:20:41.406]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:20:41.406 --> 01:20:46.468]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:20:46.468 --> 01:20:50.650]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:20:50.650 --> 01:20:52.430]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[01:20:52.430 --> 01:20:57.032]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[01:21:01.923 --> 01:21:05.950]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:21:05.950 --> 01:21:09.195]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:21:09.195 --> 01:21:10.617]  As we're finishing off this agenda...
[01:21:11.317 --> 01:21:14.020]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:21:14.020 --> 01:21:20.386]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:21:20.386 --> 01:21:25.591]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us, as American citizens, to pay attention.
[01:21:25.591 --> 01:21:28.914]  Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation.
[01:21:28.914 --> 01:21:35.580]  A criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty, and on its ashes constructing world government.
[01:21:35.680 --> 01:21:38.021]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[01:21:38.021 --> 01:21:39.622]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:21:39.622 --> 01:21:42.083]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:21:42.083 --> 01:21:44.205]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[01:21:44.205 --> 01:21:49.347]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[01:21:49.347 --> 01:21:54.370]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com.
[01:21:54.370 --> 01:21:58.432]  Or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:22:00.467 --> 01:22:07.153]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years, hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[01:22:07.153 --> 01:22:15.260]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[01:22:15.260 --> 01:22:23.447]  Is this a flaw-free enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[01:22:23.447 --> 01:22:28.191]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[01:22:28.511 --> 01:22:33.734]  Congressman Ron Paul states it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[01:22:33.734 --> 01:22:38.097]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[01:22:38.097 --> 01:22:39.178]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[01:22:39.178 --> 01:22:43.680]  I will give a silver dollar from the early 1900s to anyone who purchases this book.
[01:22:43.680 --> 01:22:48.583]  Call 1-800-686-2237 and order a copy today.
[01:22:48.583 --> 01:22:51.585]  It's critical that the public be made aware of the system.

[01:24:43.888 --> 01:24:49.172]  Let's go ahead and take a call from Eric in Florida and Skip, Victor, Amber, and others.
[01:24:49.172 --> 01:24:49.953]  You're on the air.
[01:24:49.953 --> 01:24:51.634]  Go ahead, Eric.
[01:24:51.634 --> 01:24:52.855]  Hi, good afternoon, Alex.
[01:24:52.855 --> 01:24:53.395]  How are you?
[01:24:53.395 --> 01:24:55.437]  Fighting as hard as I can.
[01:24:55.437 --> 01:24:58.600]  If this was the Alamo, I'd be up there swinging my musket.
[01:24:58.600 --> 01:24:59.020]  Yes, sir.
[01:24:59.020 --> 01:25:00.361]  That's a big 10-4.
[01:25:00.361 --> 01:25:12.410]  Hey, I've got something I want to get to, but first I want to say I did see a trailer for the Fall of the Republic, and it was, without a doubt, the most professional, the slickest of all your stuff.
[01:25:13.556 --> 01:25:25.602]  Everybody should see it, and I also want to just say to all your listeners that everybody should get out there and do their part, whatever that might be, whether it's talking to their neighbors, talking to a grocery store.
[01:25:25.602 --> 01:25:35.267]  Letters to the editor, calling in to talk radio and plugging the film, making copies of it, putting it on AXS TV, giving it to your congressman or woman.
[01:25:35.267 --> 01:25:42.451]  Whatever it takes, and the person they can't get through to, they need to just go ahead and skip over and go on to the next person.
[01:25:43.735 --> 01:25:58.225]  Yeah, don't waste time with ninnies, because they'll think you're trying to impress them or that you're on a power trip, and they'll get that little demonic glow of, I love being a slave, I think it's cute, I'm a deep down coward, so I've crime stopped, I've subconsciously decided I love tyranny.
[01:25:58.225 --> 01:26:03.249]  You know, you could put a bucket of sewage in front of them and they'd eat it like it was apple pie.
[01:26:03.249 --> 01:26:05.991]  Just move on from the biological slave.
[01:26:06.823 --> 01:26:11.926]  Hey Alex, I just want to point out I see a lot of people in my line of work.
[01:26:11.926 --> 01:26:16.929]  I'm a bartender and there's a lot of disgust and a lot of angst out there.
[01:26:16.929 --> 01:26:20.971]  But I want to go ahead and get right to the reason I called you.
[01:26:20.971 --> 01:26:26.614]  I just picked up my mail a little bit ago and I got something from our friends at FEMA in the mail.
[01:26:26.614 --> 01:26:28.595]  Oh, hmm.
[01:26:28.595 --> 01:26:32.858]  Yeah, and what it is is it says, let me get to the right page here.
[01:26:33.682 --> 01:26:37.223]  Uh, important information about your flood insurance coverage.
[01:26:37.223 --> 01:26:49.946]  Yeah, they federalize, I was about to say that, they're federalizing everything in the name of floodplains, and expanding the floodplains everywhere, even people on mountaintops are now being put on them, so FEMA can control development.
[01:26:49.946 --> 01:27:00.568]  Right, and on the one page it says, it's the acknowledgement of receipt, and it says the person listed on the policy as the named insurer should sign and date this form.
[01:27:01.243 --> 01:27:14.857]  Yeah, they announced 10 years ago in the 2000 census in 99 when they were getting rolling that they were going to start a yearly census by 2009 and that you're just now going to get stuff in the mail saying we're going to arrest you if you don't fill this out.
[01:27:14.857 --> 01:27:15.737]  No more Fifth Amendment.
[01:27:15.737 --> 01:27:23.866]  I mean you could be caught in a basement with 14 dead bodies covered with axe wounds all over them and the police couldn't compel you to incriminate yourself.
[01:27:24.426 --> 01:27:31.151]  But they get up there like roosters up on the church top and say, you've got to fill out every form we say.
[01:27:31.151 --> 01:27:35.093]  And everybody just rolls over like jellyfish and does it.
[01:27:35.093 --> 01:27:46.421]  And I just, I wanted to just bring that to you and your listeners attention because I think this is one of those examples of your color of law thing where it doesn't say you have to do it, but that you should do it.
[01:27:47.828 --> 01:27:49.849]  Absolutely, and you should drink fluoride water.
[01:27:49.849 --> 01:27:52.510]  They have public service announcements now on radio and TV.
[01:27:52.510 --> 01:27:56.092]  I've seen them, and I'm so busy I haven't even taped it.
[01:27:56.092 --> 01:28:00.114]  You know, you always catch it and you don't have a VCR or DVD recording or DVR recording.
[01:28:01.293 --> 01:28:06.096]  But they're now going, tap water, the healthiest, the best.
[01:28:06.096 --> 01:28:23.387]  Bottled water can be dangerous, and uses a few examples of where it's been bad bottled water, and it certainly can be if they don't clean the filtering systems when they're making it, and then when it finally gets overflowed, all the poison that's backed up, tens of thousands of gallons worth of water that's been treated, all of it then basically precipitates out into the bottled water.
[01:28:23.387 --> 01:28:29.851]  That's why you gotta filter it yourself, but they'll, all these public service announcements, don't drink bottled water, don't filter it,
[01:28:30.051 --> 01:28:30.752]  We're the government.
[01:28:30.752 --> 01:28:31.652]  We love you so much.
[01:28:31.652 --> 01:28:33.253]  We care so much about your teeth.
[01:28:33.253 --> 01:28:34.214]  Just please drink it.
[01:28:34.214 --> 01:28:35.155]  Everything's going to be fine.
[01:28:35.155 --> 01:28:36.355]  Just trust us.
[01:28:36.355 --> 01:28:37.696]  We care so much about you.
[01:28:37.696 --> 01:28:39.177]  Take the vaccine.
[01:28:39.177 --> 01:28:41.519]  Don't read all our government textbooks and policy reports.
[01:28:41.519 --> 01:28:43.300]  We want to poison you and sterilize you.
[01:28:43.300 --> 01:28:44.061]  Just believe us.
[01:28:44.061 --> 01:28:44.982]  We're so good.
[01:28:44.982 --> 01:28:45.782]  We just want to help you.
[01:28:45.782 --> 01:28:46.803]  Please.
[01:28:46.803 --> 01:28:47.543]  Oh my gosh.
[01:28:47.543 --> 01:28:48.044]  We love you.
[01:28:48.584 --> 01:28:51.127]  I mean, it's just so sick and evil.
[01:28:51.127 --> 01:29:01.617]  I mean, imagine that, if somebody would have made a science fiction movie 50 years ago, where they were putting poison in the water, and had public service announcements about, be sure and drink your fluoride water!
[01:29:01.617 --> 01:29:04.480]  Give it to your children!
[01:29:04.480 --> 01:29:05.421]  It's good!
[01:29:06.747 --> 01:29:08.748]  Don't believe the conspiracy theory?
[01:29:08.748 --> 01:29:10.970]  I mean, doesn't that creep all of you out?
[01:29:10.970 --> 01:29:12.471]  Can't you see through it?
[01:29:12.471 --> 01:29:14.312]  Can't you get your heads out of the sand?
[01:29:14.312 --> 01:29:16.333]  Can't you stand up for your family?
[01:29:16.333 --> 01:29:23.878]  Can't you go to the city councils and county commissioners and say, GET THE FLUORIDE OUT OF MY STINKING WATER, DOG MEAT!
[01:29:23.878 --> 01:29:27.820]  GET IT OUT, YOU FILTHY CONTROL FREAK ENVIRONMENTALIST MURDERER!
[01:29:27.820 --> 01:29:28.941]  YOU SON OF A BITCH!
[01:29:29.401 --> 01:29:30.682]  Killing my kids!
[01:29:30.682 --> 01:29:31.862]  Killing my wife!
[01:29:31.862 --> 01:29:34.083]  Killing my family, you little bastard!
[01:29:34.083 --> 01:29:36.965]  They deserve to all be in prison, or on death row!
[01:29:36.965 --> 01:29:41.387]  Not up there in their fancy suits, at their city councils, murdering us!
[01:29:41.387 --> 01:29:43.148]  Get some testosterone!
[01:29:43.148 --> 01:29:44.649]  Get some guts going!
[01:29:44.649 --> 01:29:47.951]  See through how we're all in pens, being euthanized!
[01:29:47.951 --> 01:29:49.872]  We're not animals, we're human beings!
[01:29:49.872 --> 01:29:51.512]  Wake up!
[01:29:51.512 --> 01:29:52.913]  We're on the march.
[01:29:52.913 --> 01:29:55.454]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:55.454 --> 01:29:58.136]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:01.832 --> 01:30:05.853]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:30:05.853 --> 01:30:09.094]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:30:09.094 --> 01:30:13.895]  As we're finishing off this agenda, that we're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:30:13.895 --> 01:30:20.277]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:30:20.277 --> 01:30:22.518]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[01:30:23.038 --> 01:30:23.358]  Tim Geithner?
[01:30:23.358 --> 01:30:23.878]  Bernanke?
[01:30:23.878 --> 01:30:24.539]  They're arsonists!
[01:30:24.539 --> 01:30:25.819]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:30:25.819 --> 01:30:28.060]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:30:41.966 --> 01:30:49.228]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[01:30:49.228 --> 01:30:58.351]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv
[01:31:01.155 --> 01:31:04.157]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:31:04.157 --> 01:31:09.502]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:31:09.502 --> 01:31:11.543]  My answer would be all I can get.
[01:31:11.543 --> 01:31:16.547]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[01:31:16.547 --> 01:31:17.468]  How much do you want?
[01:31:17.728 --> 01:31:18.849]  When do you want it?
[01:31:18.849 --> 01:31:20.730]  Now or after the battle starts?
[01:31:20.730 --> 01:31:21.811]  When will you need it?
[01:31:21.811 --> 01:31:24.012]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[01:31:24.012 --> 01:31:25.353]  Will there be any food?
[01:31:25.353 --> 01:31:26.874]  Will it make your children sick?
[01:31:26.874 --> 01:31:32.137]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[01:31:32.137 --> 01:31:35.720]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[01:31:35.720 --> 01:31:39.202]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[01:31:39.542 --> 01:31:40.763]  How much will you need?
[01:31:40.763 --> 01:31:41.664]  We don't know.
[01:31:41.664 --> 01:31:42.765]  How much do you want?
[01:31:42.765 --> 01:31:43.706]  All you can get.
[01:31:43.706 --> 01:31:44.807]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:31:44.807 --> 01:31:47.850]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[01:31:47.850 --> 01:31:49.632]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[01:31:49.632 --> 01:31:50.552]  Again that number 1-800-409-5633.
[01:32:00.097 --> 01:32:10.199]  This is Alex Jones, and I want to tell you all about Ecolablu, the state-of-the-art atmospheric water generators that produces purified drinking water right from the humidity in the air you breathe.
[01:32:10.199 --> 01:32:11.820]  No, this isn't science fiction.
[01:32:11.820 --> 01:32:12.880]  It's very real.
[01:32:12.880 --> 01:32:13.240]  I know.
[01:32:13.240 --> 01:32:17.461]  I use one every day in my own home, and it's available right now to you.
[01:32:17.461 --> 01:32:20.682]  Clean, great-tasting water, without all the pollutants.
[01:32:20.682 --> 01:32:28.884]  Make the decision today to claim your own water independence by ordering or own a Ecolablu atmospheric water generator for your home or business, just like I did.
[01:32:29.324 --> 01:32:36.029]  Their best seller, the Ecolablue 28, produces up to 7 gallons of water every day and is easy to use and economical.
[01:32:36.029 --> 01:32:44.736]  This system is free of chemicals and uses a multi-stage filtration system, including reverse osmosis, carbon filters, and ultraviolet lights.
[01:32:44.736 --> 01:32:49.440]  Generate your own pure water right from the humidity in the air by calling Ecolablue at 1-800-691-6043.
[01:32:49.440 --> 01:32:50.821]  That's 1-800-691-6043 or visit Ecolablue on the web
[01:32:57.226 --> 01:33:12.695]  Is it getting better?
[01:33:12.695 --> 01:33:17.538]  Is it getting better?
[01:33:17.538 --> 01:33:22.881]  Or do you feel the same?
[01:33:22.881 --> 01:33:25.183]  Will it make it easier on you now?
[01:33:29.985 --> 01:33:35.327]  In the end, Barack Obama should thank me for making Fall of the Republic.
[01:33:35.327 --> 01:33:40.068]  So should that sickening traitor, George W. Bush.
[01:33:40.068 --> 01:33:46.949]  Because these films, The Obama Deception and Fall of the Republic, document that they're just puppets and frontmen.
[01:33:46.949 --> 01:33:52.430]  And though they're guilty of many of the crimes carried out by their bosses, they are only frontmen.
[01:33:52.430 --> 01:33:53.631]  Foot soldiers.
[01:33:53.631 --> 01:33:54.711]  Enforcers.
[01:33:54.711 --> 01:33:55.251]  Capos.
[01:33:56.420 --> 01:34:00.882]  And they build them up and then destroy them and then bring in the next puppet.
[01:34:00.882 --> 01:34:02.903]  And that's why Follow the Republic is so important.
[01:34:02.903 --> 01:34:07.224]  It details the police state, the banking takeover, the global carbon tax, everything.
[01:34:07.224 --> 01:34:09.165]  This is the film for this time.
[01:34:09.165 --> 01:34:10.806]  This is my most powerful film.
[01:34:11.963 --> 01:34:13.725]  And everyone needs to see it.
[01:34:13.725 --> 01:34:20.250]  I'm asking you to order the DVD at Infowars.com today on the online video bookstore shopping cart.
[01:34:20.250 --> 01:34:22.132]  I'm asking you to make copies of it.
[01:34:22.132 --> 01:34:28.977]  I'm asking you to get a PrisonPlanet.tv membership and download the DivX version and burn it to disk and give it to everyone you know.
[01:34:28.977 --> 01:34:30.459]  I'm asking you to take action.
[01:34:30.459 --> 01:34:34.162]  I'm asking you to call the toll-free number 888-253-3139 and to not wait and not count on others.
[01:34:34.162 --> 01:34:35.083]  The Obama deception
[01:34:41.363 --> 01:34:42.384]  Has been devastating.
[01:34:42.384 --> 01:34:52.313]  They have written scores of mainstream news articles attacking me for the Obama deception and admitting it's hurt them.
[01:34:52.313 --> 01:34:54.355]  That's because of you taking action.
[01:34:54.355 --> 01:34:56.497]  Sure, I'm the quarterback.
[01:34:56.497 --> 01:35:03.002]  I got the ball downfield, but you have been the receivers that are marching down the enemy lines and we're having victories.
[01:35:03.002 --> 01:35:04.304]  Let's redouble our efforts.
[01:35:05.302 --> 01:35:07.427]  Because we're coming from behind here.
[01:35:07.427 --> 01:35:09.290]  We're putting points on the board.
[01:35:09.290 --> 01:35:12.698]  We have got to come from behind with a winning spirit and beat these people.
[01:35:13.533 --> 01:35:17.876]  And this is the big football game that actually matters for your family and your future.
[01:35:17.876 --> 01:35:20.418]  This tyranny is unlike any tyranny we've ever seen.
[01:35:20.418 --> 01:35:21.979]  This is not a boss hog tyranny.
[01:35:21.979 --> 01:35:23.160]  Those are bad enough.
[01:35:23.160 --> 01:35:30.264]  This is a scientifically crafted system that is designed to stop us from defeating them.
[01:35:30.264 --> 01:35:32.486]  But if we're aware of their tricks, we can stop them.
[01:35:32.486 --> 01:35:39.551]  The Obama deception and fall of the republic, both these films need to be gotten out to everybody.
[01:35:39.551 --> 01:35:39.771]  Okay.
[01:35:40.811 --> 01:35:46.893]  For the rest of this hour, I'm going to do a news blitz, then we've got open phones, 1-800-259-9231.
[01:35:46.893 --> 01:35:56.217]  I wanted to get Timothy Baldwin on, first time he's been with us, and he attended the University of West Florida, received a bachelor's degree in English, political science.
[01:35:56.217 --> 01:36:00.819]  There he went to Cumberland Law School, and we appreciate him coming on.
[01:36:00.819 --> 01:36:06.821]  He began his career at the State Attorney's Office in Florida.
[01:36:07.884 --> 01:36:09.585]  And it goes on from there.
[01:36:09.585 --> 01:36:11.506]  2006, Baldwin opened his law office in Pensacola.
[01:36:11.506 --> 01:36:14.267]  He's also helped his dad on his campaign for president.
[01:36:14.267 --> 01:36:20.409]  And we've had Chuck Baldwin on so many times in the last 12, 13, 14, 13 years I've been interviewing Chuck Baldwin.
[01:36:20.409 --> 01:36:21.670]  I thought we'd have him on.
[01:36:21.670 --> 01:36:26.672]  Plus, he's got a talent for breaking down history and the facts, just like his father.
[01:36:27.834 --> 01:36:28.575]  Chuck Baldwin.
[01:36:28.575 --> 01:36:42.643]  So Timothy Baldwin joins us for the next 25 minutes till this hour ends, then news blitz, then your phone calls for Skip, Victor, Amber, Cody, Dayton, and others that are patiently holding.
[01:36:42.643 --> 01:36:45.525]  We're going to get to you as well today.
[01:36:45.525 --> 01:36:49.207]  And I'm going to get into the New York Times, an article, an editorial written by the
[01:36:49.827 --> 01:36:50.968]  It's my pleasure to be on your show, Alex.
[01:36:50.968 --> 01:36:51.648]  Thank you for having me.
[01:37:19.053 --> 01:37:20.714]  It's good to have you.
[01:37:20.714 --> 01:37:25.457]  Well, growing up, seeing your dad fight the New World Order, it's good to see you fighting it today.
[01:37:25.457 --> 01:37:31.321]  Tell us a little bit about your take on the state of the world right now and this key point in history.
[01:37:31.321 --> 01:37:36.725]  When the New World Order is openly emerging, people are waking up, but we're in a limited window to defeat them.
[01:37:36.725 --> 01:37:41.728]  Then let's get into your latest article, Freedom's Destruction Through Constitutional Deconstruction.
[01:37:43.194 --> 01:38:03.105]  Well, you know, Alex, as you've highlighted on your show for so many years, the corruption of the federal government, I think it would be... You would have to have your head completely in the sand not to know... You know what?
[01:38:03.105 --> 01:38:06.567]  We lost your phone again and it's the exact same sound with our last guest.
[01:38:06.567 --> 01:38:07.667]  It may be our system.
[01:38:07.667 --> 01:38:09.508]  We had a huge crash.
[01:38:09.508 --> 01:38:10.149]  It is our system?
[01:38:11.482 --> 01:38:14.303]  We had a huge crash, Timothy, yesterday.
[01:38:14.303 --> 01:38:18.024]  Can we go to an analog phone or something else with him immediately?
[01:38:18.024 --> 01:38:22.826]  Because this is really... We're gonna go to the Genesis Network.
[01:38:22.826 --> 01:38:26.527]  We're gonna go back to them doing the phone calls for now.
[01:38:26.527 --> 01:38:27.247]  Till this is fixed.
[01:38:27.247 --> 01:38:29.828]  We're gonna go back to Mr. Baldwin.
[01:38:29.828 --> 01:38:33.029]  There I was, griping at my guest yesterday for bad phones.
[01:38:33.029 --> 01:38:33.949]  And I know that sound.
[01:38:33.949 --> 01:38:37.090]  That's us.
[01:38:37.090 --> 01:38:38.671]  And I go back to the issue of funding.
[01:38:43.180 --> 01:38:45.241]  I need to hire an extra IT person.
[01:38:45.241 --> 01:38:46.481]  Desperately.
[01:38:46.481 --> 01:38:48.242]  We need three.
[01:38:48.242 --> 01:38:53.124]  I mean, these guys were up here this weekend when we had a server crash with the mail server.
[01:38:53.124 --> 01:38:56.805]  We had this whole system go haywire Sunday where Burma's couldn't even do a show.
[01:38:56.805 --> 01:39:00.546]  I'm not complaining.
[01:39:00.546 --> 01:39:04.548]  We have had just constant issues and we've had consultants in here.
[01:39:04.548 --> 01:39:09.510]  They say our IT guys are extremely talented and are doing a fabulous job, but
[01:39:12.363 --> 01:39:19.170]  There's just too much for them to do, because they're busy fixing broken computers and all sorts of other stuff and dealing with this.
[01:39:19.170 --> 01:39:23.794]  So please continue to support us, ladies and gentlemen, because we have a great cost here.
[01:39:23.794 --> 01:39:35.065]  Okay, let's start over, Timothy Baldwin, with the point you were making about having to have your head examined if you think the government isn't out of control.
[01:39:35.065 --> 01:39:35.346]  Go ahead.
[01:39:36.092 --> 01:39:44.278]  Yeah, you know, Alex, I think the, as our founder said, that the evidences are clear of the usurpations and the abuses of government.
[01:39:44.278 --> 01:39:53.224]  I mean, you know, we can sit here and talk for months and months about the corruption that we've seen and what we believe it means and where it's leading us.
[01:39:53.224 --> 01:40:02.011]  I think that the evidence is very clear that they're trying to unite the nations in a global type economy and structure.
[01:40:02.011 --> 01:40:02.411]  Of course,
[01:40:02.952 --> 01:40:07.736]  This goes in line with their desire for power and money.
[01:40:07.736 --> 01:40:15.383]  It's the nature of mankind to use other people for their advantage, and this is what we're seeing.
[01:40:15.383 --> 01:40:29.255]  What I have tried to do is I have tried to study history, particularly our history, to see what cures there are for this type of abuse and this type of encroachment.
[01:40:30.649 --> 01:40:49.202]  You know, my conclusion is that it's similar to what Alexander Hamilton said, and of course, I'm no fan of Alexander Hamilton, but I believe what he said in the Federalist Papers was very true, and that is, to best preserve freedom, you need power to be able to check power.
[01:40:49.202 --> 01:40:56.407]  And of course, the context of what he said there was that the state governments were to be used to check the federal government.
[01:40:58.077 --> 01:40:59.799]  A separation of powers.
[01:40:59.799 --> 01:41:06.126]  Powers set against themselves and that was one of the few issues that the founders unanimously agreed upon.
[01:41:06.126 --> 01:41:16.077]  They just debated about how to arrange that structure and they did a lot off the Greek and of course the common law in England and of course off the Dutch system.
[01:41:16.077 --> 01:41:16.777]  As you know,
[01:41:17.458 --> 01:41:20.321]  But now that's been undermined by the foreign offshore corporations.
[01:41:20.321 --> 01:41:23.043]  That's why we need to take over the local governments.
[01:41:23.043 --> 01:41:27.907]  And that's why we need to also, as patriots, take over the government and have the long view of history.
[01:41:27.907 --> 01:41:37.956]  And that's why we need to financially support alternative media and institutions so that we can grow our power to then be able to face down the establishment.
[01:41:37.956 --> 01:41:39.297]  Go ahead.
[01:41:39.297 --> 01:41:44.382]  Well, you know, and this is something that I'm trying to educate people when I talk and when I write about this subject.
[01:41:44.847 --> 01:41:48.288]  You know, when you study our history, one thing is very clear.
[01:41:48.288 --> 01:41:54.430]  Our founders and the ratifiers of our Constitution rejected the national form of government.
[01:41:54.430 --> 01:42:06.494]  And they were very clear that what they wanted was a federal system, that is, the states had co-equal power with regard to all the powers that they retained under the 10th Amendment.
[01:42:06.494 --> 01:42:07.915]  And 9th.
[01:42:07.915 --> 01:42:08.995]  And the 9th Amendment as well.
[01:42:09.930 --> 01:42:13.111]  But the problem, what we have here, if we look through the U.S.
[01:42:13.111 --> 01:42:19.753]  Supreme Court decisions, we have a complete reversal of that idea and that understanding.
[01:42:19.753 --> 01:42:22.773]  And that starts after the Civil War, does it not?
[01:42:22.773 --> 01:42:36.177]  Well, it started before that because the U.S., particularly under Joseph Story's court and also, of course, John Marshall, they tried to establish through their decisions
[01:42:36.795 --> 01:42:45.201]  That the federal court, I mean, that the federal government was a supreme sovereignty over the state's sovereignties through the Supremacy Clause.
[01:42:45.201 --> 01:42:47.802]  And what they tried to establish was the U.S.
[01:42:47.802 --> 01:42:52.586]  Supreme Court has the ultimate final decision on what the Constitution means.
[01:42:52.586 --> 01:42:56.008]  And that's just contrary to what our federal system is all about.
[01:42:56.008 --> 01:43:00.251]  It is power checking power, state power checking federal power.
[01:43:00.251 --> 01:43:04.914]  And as you just mentioned, after the Civil War, they really were able to grab a hold of that idea
[01:43:05.467 --> 01:43:05.807]  Absolutely.
[01:43:05.807 --> 01:43:13.356]  And from the beginning, the founder stated it was a confederation of states that met to arbitrate their disputes in the Federal Congress, but that anytime a state wanted to leave,
[01:43:26.630 --> 01:43:28.211]  Yes, exactly.
[01:43:28.211 --> 01:43:31.773]  And you know, Alex, if there's one thing I would wish people would get a concept of, and that is
[01:43:54.542 --> 01:44:01.867]  The concept that the states have just as much power to defend freedom as any other sovereign country or sovereign state.
[01:44:01.867 --> 01:44:04.769]  But they must exercise that power.
[01:44:04.769 --> 01:44:09.632]  They must, and unfortunately for more than a hundred years the states have really not done that.
[01:44:09.632 --> 01:44:23.302]  It's only until recently that the states are actually becoming more aware of their powers under the Tenth Amendment, all the retained powers that they have, to try to once again reestablish these ideals of freedom that we hold.
[01:44:23.866 --> 01:44:26.030]  And it's good to see some of the states doing that.
[01:44:26.030 --> 01:44:33.382]  I'm sure you're very familiar with the Montana Firearms Freedom Act, which I am actually a part of that litigation, by the way.
[01:44:33.382 --> 01:44:33.943]  Well, good!
[01:44:33.943 --> 01:44:36.267]  And for those that don't know about it, why don't you tell people?
[01:44:37.099 --> 01:44:43.145]  Well, it's a law that was passed in Montana, and of course in Tennessee as well, and other states are introducing this bill.
[01:44:43.145 --> 01:44:47.689]  And it's got the feds very, very scared, and it's something you and your father helped lead.
[01:44:47.689 --> 01:44:51.352]  Another example of ideas, putting them into action.
[01:44:51.352 --> 01:44:53.995]  True leadership.
[01:44:53.995 --> 01:44:58.219]  And if others get behind this, it is a tide that is going to be unstoppable.
[01:44:59.233 --> 01:45:17.526]  Exactly, because what it says is, look, if we create this product, in this case it's a gun, but it could be anything, if we create this product and we sell it within our sovereign borders, in this case the state of Montana, then the federal regulations have no applicability in that state whatsoever.
[01:45:17.526 --> 01:45:20.929]  The Interstate Commerce Clause has no authority.
[01:45:20.929 --> 01:45:22.029]  Exactly.
[01:45:22.029 --> 01:45:23.210]  And that's what we're trying to do.
[01:45:23.210 --> 01:45:27.073]  And of course, I wasn't the great people in Montana that
[01:45:27.555 --> 01:45:28.056]  I don't think.
[01:45:45.743 --> 01:45:57.946]  Of US Supreme Court decisions that have, well actually I'll take that back, about 80 years of US Supreme Court decisions that have given Congress this power to just roughshod over state sovereignty and it's reversing all that.
[01:45:57.946 --> 01:46:07.228]  So it's very important but it's things like that that are going to protect freedom and it's going to really put the brakes on this New World Order.
[01:46:07.228 --> 01:46:14.670]  If we stop and think about it, the federal government has absolutely no power to do anything unless the states are behind them and supporting them.
[01:46:15.273 --> 01:46:23.737]  So as soon as the states realize that they have the power to stop this almost overnight, we may see a chance of restoration in this country.
[01:46:23.737 --> 01:46:30.220]  But until we get back to this idea, I don't believe that we're going to have much of a chance short of just outright revolution.
[01:46:30.220 --> 01:46:35.322]  And I don't think many people want to go down that road because of the cost it entails at this point.
[01:46:35.322 --> 01:46:41.925]  But the point is that we have to get back to the ideas of federalism, which were the protecting guardians of freedom in this country.
[01:46:43.357 --> 01:46:43.918]  Absolutely.
[01:46:43.918 --> 01:46:48.262]  Go through the battle plan that you break down in this article.
[01:46:48.262 --> 01:47:06.459]  Well, you're referring to the freedom of destruction through constitutional... Sure, and some of the other articles you and the Constitution Party, your father and others have been putting out, battle plans, dealing with the states, teaching people the right and proper duties of the state and the people that reside within the states.
[01:47:06.459 --> 01:47:08.441]  Well, that particular article that I wrote
[01:47:09.883 --> 01:47:23.872]  What I try to do is highlight the fact that during the Constitutional Convention debates, the founders and the ratifiers rejected this notion that the federal government has the power to negate state laws.
[01:47:23.872 --> 01:47:33.958]  In other words, under the Tenth Amendment, the state laws under their sovereignty was not to be negated by the federal laws.
[01:47:36.427 --> 01:47:37.668]  They rejected that idea.
[01:47:37.668 --> 01:47:53.440]  So, in other words, the states still have the power to do this, and it's through the constitutional amendment process that the states are to decide what they want the Constitution to be, to preserve the freedoms.
[01:47:53.440 --> 01:48:00.045]  And what I try to do is highlight the fact that this is not what has been told us over the past 100 years.
[01:48:00.045 --> 01:48:01.366]  We've been told that the U.S.
[01:48:01.366 --> 01:48:04.368]  Supreme Court and the federal government has sovereign
[01:48:05.217 --> 01:48:08.339]  ...of supreme sovereignty over the states, and it just is not true.
[01:48:08.339 --> 01:48:12.102]  It was rejected by the Founders and by the ratifiers specifically.
[01:48:12.102 --> 01:48:14.063]  The history is very clear on this subject, Alex.
[01:48:14.063 --> 01:48:19.287]  Of course, I'm sure you know this, but your listeners need to understand that this is very clear.
[01:48:19.287 --> 01:48:29.354]  We know that the Founders rejected the nationalistic idea that states are to have the same co-equal powers that the federal government has with regard to their powers.
[01:48:29.921 --> 01:48:35.928]  And that's co-equal on the few, the three powers delegated to the federal government.
[01:48:35.928 --> 01:48:46.341]  The states are actually superior to the federal government because all powers not expressly delegated to the federal government are expressly reserved to the states or the people.
[01:48:47.322 --> 01:48:48.082]  Exactly right.
[01:48:48.082 --> 01:49:07.986]  You know, if you take a look at what they rejected, what they actually proposed during the conventions for the federal government to have power to regulate, if you look at that, it mentioned agriculture, it mentioned education, it mentioned commerce in general, and they actually rejected those and removed those from the federal government's power.
[01:49:07.986 --> 01:49:15.468]  So yes, their power is very, very limited, and it's only been through this supposed living constitution idea
[01:49:16.279 --> 01:49:24.563]  That we have been defrauded, and criminally I think, defrauded from our natural rights of compact here.
[01:49:24.563 --> 01:49:37.509]  But the point of the matter is this, the states have the power to reclaim these powers that have been taken from them, because it's their power, it's the power that they got from the sovereigns of their state, that is the people.
[01:49:37.509 --> 01:49:44.733]  Yes, they've usurped our power, and now the state tells us they're God, and police are taught worshipping the government.
[01:49:45.729 --> 01:49:48.171]  Is what is patriotic.
[01:49:48.171 --> 01:49:48.791]  Right.
[01:49:48.791 --> 01:49:48.971]  Right.
[01:49:48.971 --> 01:49:49.892]  It's very dangerous.
[01:49:49.892 --> 01:49:52.074]  And we've just become so used to it.
[01:49:52.074 --> 01:49:55.156]  We've become mind slaves to their agenda.
[01:49:55.156 --> 01:50:00.460]  And we need a serious awakening and enlightenment of this understanding.
[01:50:00.460 --> 01:50:08.065]  But once people understand this, it will cause a tremendous movement, I believe, in restoring our republic.
[01:50:08.065 --> 01:50:15.110]  Because, you know, it's like the competition of commerce or the economic competition model.
[01:50:15.558 --> 01:50:16.959]  Absolutely, and the COINTELPRO operatives
[01:50:42.122 --> 01:50:46.306]  Every time we try to build something or a movement, they'll go, it's not instant.
[01:50:46.306 --> 01:50:47.027]  You're stupid.
[01:50:47.027 --> 01:50:48.849]  We need to just shoot everybody.
[01:50:48.849 --> 01:50:50.931]  They always turn out to be feds.
[01:50:50.931 --> 01:50:53.153]  They know we're in the right.
[01:50:53.153 --> 01:50:58.118]  And if we just orderly, in an orderly way, educate people, we're going to win.
[01:50:58.118 --> 01:50:58.598]  Stay there.
[01:50:58.598 --> 01:51:00.140]  We'll be right back with Timothy Baldwin.
[01:51:00.987 --> 01:51:05.589]  Worried that inflation will ruin your retirement or plans of sending your kids to college?
[01:51:05.589 --> 01:51:06.589]  Get a pencil.
[01:51:06.589 --> 01:51:08.870]  Discover how to turn $10,000 into possibly $431,000 in the next 12 to 18 months.
[01:51:08.870 --> 01:51:13.272]  For example, investors who took Scott Smith's advice and invested $10,000 in Silver Standard Resources turned it into $431,000.
[01:51:13.272 --> 01:51:16.153]  And those who invested in Seabridge Gold shares turned $10,000 into $800,000.
[01:51:29.359 --> 01:51:35.401]  Scott Smith is the former senior executive of Credit Suisse and editor of Swiss Confidential, an investment newspaper.
[01:51:38.444 --> 01:51:38.824]  I think so.
[01:52:02.156 --> 01:52:06.185]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:52:06.185 --> 01:52:09.411]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:52:09.411 --> 01:52:10.834]  As we're finishing off this agenda...
[01:52:11.542 --> 01:52:14.225]  That we're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:52:14.225 --> 01:52:20.591]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:52:20.591 --> 01:52:25.796]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[01:52:25.796 --> 01:52:35.785]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[01:52:35.885 --> 01:52:38.226]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[01:52:38.226 --> 01:52:39.827]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:52:39.827 --> 01:52:42.288]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:52:42.288 --> 01:52:44.410]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[01:52:44.410 --> 01:52:49.552]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[01:52:49.552 --> 01:52:58.677]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:53:00.953 --> 01:53:02.133]  The once mighty U.S.
[01:53:02.133 --> 01:53:05.174]  dollar has been replaced as the world's reserve currency.
[01:53:05.174 --> 01:53:07.835]  Trillions and trillions of dollars outside the U.S.
[01:53:07.835 --> 01:53:11.016]  will come rushing back to be redeemed into anything tangible.
[01:53:11.016 --> 01:53:15.298]  Foreigners will buy anything at any price to escape the soon worthless dollar.
[01:53:15.298 --> 01:53:22.880]  The once great dollar has been destroyed by our own reckless and irresponsible leaders, and Americans will soon be paying the price for this foolish behavior.
[01:53:23.400 --> 01:53:24.641]  Prepare now.
[01:53:24.641 --> 01:53:29.584]  Ready Reserve Foods is the manufacturer, unlike other companies that just broker canned foods.
[01:53:29.584 --> 01:53:35.087]  Ready Reserve controls the quality from start to finish with double enameled cans and nitrogen packaging.
[01:53:35.087 --> 01:53:39.890]  When purchasing from Ready Reserve Foods, you're buying factory direct at wholesale prices.
[01:53:39.890 --> 01:53:42.071]  Many companies do not even offer a catalog.
[01:53:42.071 --> 01:53:45.013]  We will be more than happy to send a catalog to you free of charge.
[01:53:45.513 --> 01:53:45.813]  Dial 1-800-453-2202.
[01:53:45.813 --> 01:53:45.893]  1-800-453-2202.
[01:53:45.893 --> 01:53:48.014]  Or visit our website at ReadyReserveFoods.com.
[01:53:48.014 --> 01:53:48.875]  Factory direct.
[01:53:48.875 --> 01:53:50.276]  Wholesale pricing from Ready Reserve Foods.
[01:53:50.276 --> 01:53:50.776]  Call us at 1-800-453-2202.
[01:53:50.776 --> 01:53:53.357]  Chuck Baldwin's politically active lawyer son, fighting the tyranny, joins us.
[01:54:12.213 --> 01:54:18.297]  Wrote the column, Freedom's Destruction Through Constitutional Deconstruction.
[01:54:18.297 --> 01:54:26.061]  Got about five minutes left, and I'm coming back with phone calls with the first five-minute segment, then a news blitz, then more phone calls, then Lindsey Williams.
[01:54:26.061 --> 01:54:32.745]  You want to hear about the UN openly announcing world government yet again, arrogantly, and how the carbon tax is the key to it all.
[01:54:32.745 --> 01:54:35.767]  And I think the key for us to understand
[01:54:36.690 --> 01:54:39.993]  Mr. Baldwin, is that we are running out of time.
[01:54:39.993 --> 01:54:54.504]  We are now here, inside the world government, instead of corruption that's running rampant, just stagnating, it's blooming, and now is the time for everybody to start seeing themselves as leaders and getting involved.
[01:54:54.504 --> 01:55:00.029]  And it doesn't mean we'll save the world by ourselves, but many hands make light work.
[01:55:00.029 --> 01:55:02.311]  Closing comments, Timothy Baldwin.
[01:55:03.646 --> 01:55:13.311]  Well Alex, I think that we are in fact short of time and I believe that we are at a decision similar to our founding fathers.
[01:55:13.311 --> 01:55:24.738]  Like Samuel Adams said, we either decide to declare our independence now and live as free men or we decide to just go along and live as slaves.
[01:55:24.738 --> 01:55:26.939]  And I truly believe that we are reaching that point.
[01:55:27.455 --> 01:55:32.858]  And as you said, we are not going to be able to save the world by ourselves, but we can try to save our communities.
[01:55:32.858 --> 01:55:34.720]  We can try to save our states.
[01:55:34.720 --> 01:55:43.825]  And that's exactly the model that the Founding Fathers gave to us to keep matters that affect us the most on a state and local level.
[01:55:43.825 --> 01:55:49.869]  And when we do that, we will keep the federal government and those people who would use us as their little pawns.
[01:55:50.290 --> 01:55:51.851]  We will keep them at bay.
[01:55:51.851 --> 01:56:02.701]  And we need zero compromise and to know the politician's tricks, both parties, and to really get aggressive and just say, look, I see through all your corporate scams.
[01:56:02.701 --> 01:56:04.823]  I know you got handbooks on how to lie to me.
[01:56:04.823 --> 01:56:06.765]  The games are over!
[01:56:06.765 --> 01:56:11.269]  And if that means following a corrupt judge as an investigative reporter,
[01:56:14.795 --> 01:56:21.164]  I mean, it's time to start playing hardball with this scum.
[01:56:21.164 --> 01:56:22.907]  They're all criminals.
[01:56:22.907 --> 01:56:24.930]  We need to go after them legally and lawfully.
[01:56:26.039 --> 01:56:32.262]  I agree with that, and I think, too, it's time for the people to really start what I would consider to be ignoring the federal government.
[01:56:32.262 --> 01:56:39.746]  In other words, you know, don't give them the flattery that they're getting from us.
[01:56:39.746 --> 01:56:40.666]  Ignore them.
[01:56:40.666 --> 01:56:47.409]  They're not officials, they're not authorities, and at the same time... Go ahead.
[01:56:47.409 --> 01:56:49.050]  They're illegitimate, Alex.
[01:56:49.050 --> 01:56:54.433]  And I think with that, if we can focus on our state legislators, our state governors, judges,
[01:56:55.035 --> 01:56:56.976]  Um, county commissioners, sheriffs.
[01:56:56.976 --> 01:57:07.920]  If we can start getting those people to realize our concerns and actually have them represent us, and not just us, but represent the principles of freedom, I think that we can restore this republic.
[01:57:07.920 --> 01:57:11.261]  But, unfortunately, not all states are going to go along with that.
[01:57:11.261 --> 01:57:17.704]  There will be some that, of course, ignore that and will go along with this agenda that has been shoved down our throats for so many years.
[01:57:17.704 --> 01:57:21.205]  But, Alex, it is time for us to step up.
[01:57:21.205 --> 01:57:23.586]  We cannot be lethargic any longer.
[01:57:24.062 --> 01:57:28.284]  We have to do this now, and that's why I appreciate what you're doing so much.
[01:57:28.284 --> 01:57:32.505]  Well, I appreciate what you're doing, Timothy Baldwin, and the footsteps of your father.
[01:57:32.505 --> 01:57:39.128]  But in closing, the good news is Republicans and Democrats I talk to now know both parties are controlled.
[01:57:39.128 --> 01:57:41.228]  They finally have figured it out.
[01:57:41.228 --> 01:57:44.089]  It's been a process, but more and more are waking up.
[01:57:44.089 --> 01:57:46.390]  And people aren't saying we need to fix the government.
[01:57:46.390 --> 01:57:50.492]  They're saying the whole thing's rotten, the whole thing's corrupt, the whole thing's evil.
[01:57:51.332 --> 01:57:52.873]  And it's over.
[01:57:52.873 --> 01:57:54.315]  And the establishment knows that.
[01:57:54.315 --> 01:57:58.558]  That's why they're trying to come in to intimidate people and to bring in this tyranny.
[01:57:58.558 --> 01:58:00.600]  But that is not going to work.
[01:58:00.600 --> 01:58:03.022]  And so I salute you and I appreciate you.
[01:58:03.022 --> 01:58:06.085]  Fire out a website where folks can learn more about what you're doing.
[01:58:06.085 --> 01:58:08.207]  The Tenth Amendment Center?
[01:58:08.207 --> 01:58:10.289]  Well, the Tenth Amendment Center is a great website.
[01:58:10.289 --> 01:58:11.510]  It's run by Michael Bolden.
[01:58:11.510 --> 01:58:13.111]  He does a great job.
[01:58:13.111 --> 01:58:18.596]  My website actually is www.LibertyDefenseLeague.com
[01:58:19.622 --> 01:58:24.963]  And folks can get involved with the Liberty Defense League at LibertyDefenseLeague.com.
[01:58:24.963 --> 01:58:27.323]  Vaya con Dios, Timothy.
[01:58:27.323 --> 01:58:28.384]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:58:28.384 --> 01:58:29.984]  Thank you for joining us.
[01:58:29.984 --> 01:58:39.725]  Back in 70 seconds, with the second half of this transmission, your phone calls, news blitz, and Lindsey Williams.

[01:58:50.717 --> 01:58:56.024]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[01:58:56.024 --> 01:59:00.550]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[01:59:00.550 --> 01:59:02.833]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[01:59:02.833 --> 01:59:04.455]  You don't have to cooperate.
[01:59:04.455 --> 01:59:05.497]  There is a solution.
[01:59:05.717 --> 01:59:14.141]  Inner Health Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.

[02:00:05.568 --> 02:00:06.890]  Big Brother.
[02:00:06.890 --> 02:00:07.871]  Mainstream media.
[02:00:08.627 --> 02:00:10.388]  Government cover-ups.
[02:00:10.388 --> 02:00:11.968]  You want answers?
[02:00:11.968 --> 02:00:13.529]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.529 --> 02:00:17.731]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.731 --> 02:00:22.412]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:22.412 --> 02:00:25.894]  I get behind on my news blitzes, but there's one coming up in the next segment.
[02:00:25.894 --> 02:00:27.234]  Key information.
[02:00:27.234 --> 02:00:28.775]  Skip in Louisiana.
[02:00:28.775 --> 02:00:29.515]  You're on the air.
[02:00:29.515 --> 02:00:30.215]  Welcome, Skip.
[02:00:30.215 --> 02:00:32.516]  Thanks for holding.
[02:00:32.516 --> 02:00:33.176]  Hey, man.
[02:00:33.176 --> 02:00:34.217]  Are you there?
[02:00:34.217 --> 02:00:34.577]  Yes, sir.
[02:00:34.577 --> 02:00:36.718]  All right, man.
[02:00:36.718 --> 02:00:36.998]  Listen.
[02:00:38.194 --> 02:00:41.976]  I've been on hold for like an hour, but that's alright.
[02:00:41.976 --> 02:00:43.496]  Okay, but you told us that's important.
[02:00:43.496 --> 02:00:43.957]  We know that now.
[02:00:43.957 --> 02:00:46.097]  I've had my volume go down and down and down.
[02:00:46.097 --> 02:00:49.959]  That might be Big Brother, but you never know.
[02:00:49.959 --> 02:00:52.981]  I doubt that, but go ahead.
[02:00:52.981 --> 02:00:55.382]  Anyway, you know what?
[02:00:55.382 --> 02:00:58.323]  I've watched your movie you just did.
[02:00:58.323 --> 02:01:00.664]  Alright?
[02:01:00.664 --> 02:01:01.904]  And it was awesome.
[02:01:01.904 --> 02:01:03.465]  Thank you.
[02:01:03.465 --> 02:01:07.667]  And there's one question I have.
[02:01:08.266 --> 02:01:11.693]  And I can't, I go to YouTube and I can't find it.
[02:01:11.693 --> 02:01:18.405]  And it is, it is about our president holding another office.
[02:01:21.431 --> 02:01:21.871]  The U.N.
[02:01:21.871 --> 02:01:23.792]  The U.N.
[02:01:23.792 --> 02:01:24.573]  Are you kidding?
[02:01:24.573 --> 02:01:30.296]  I mean, we have news clips in the film where they say, President of the World, the Chairman of the U.N.
[02:01:30.296 --> 02:01:34.098]  Security Council has all the power over the U.N.
[02:01:34.098 --> 02:01:35.579]  This is historic.
[02:01:35.579 --> 02:01:37.600]  AP headline.
[02:01:37.600 --> 02:01:38.941]  Obama cements U.S.
[02:01:38.941 --> 02:01:40.742]  relationship with the U.N.
[02:01:40.742 --> 02:01:41.883]  by coming first U.S.
[02:01:41.883 --> 02:01:43.504]  President to sit.
[02:01:43.504 --> 02:01:49.127]  I mean, that is the most important, most powerful position in the U.N.
[02:01:49.127 --> 02:01:49.968]  Are you saying
[02:01:50.828 --> 02:01:53.049]  That he is not currently the Chairman of the U.N.
[02:01:53.049 --> 02:01:53.989]  Security Council?
[02:01:53.989 --> 02:01:54.649]  No!
[02:01:54.649 --> 02:01:55.329]  No!
[02:01:55.329 --> 02:02:01.691]  I'm saying, why is this not covered by any mainstream media?
[02:02:01.691 --> 02:02:03.051]  Well, I mean, watch the film.
[02:02:03.051 --> 02:02:04.131]  I mean, it's fair use.
[02:02:04.131 --> 02:02:05.672]  We'll use a few short clips.
[02:02:05.672 --> 02:02:10.473]  We have CNN, Wolf Blitzer talking about it in another news clip.
[02:02:10.473 --> 02:02:13.034]  I mean, it should be a bigger deal.
[02:02:13.034 --> 02:02:14.154]  Our whole media, like,
[02:02:14.690 --> 02:02:19.173]  My God, you cannot hold two government offices at one time.
[02:02:19.173 --> 02:02:21.335]  Yeah, it violates Article 1, Section 9 of the U.S.
[02:02:21.335 --> 02:02:24.197]  Constitution, but what did Bush say about that?
[02:02:24.197 --> 02:02:27.179]  Why don't we bring this guy?
[02:02:27.179 --> 02:02:41.389]  Why don't the citizens of the United States bring this guy to the table and say, hey, you're a fascist, you know?
[02:02:41.389 --> 02:02:43.290]  Listen, I appreciate your call, Skip.
[02:02:46.098 --> 02:02:48.379]  Obama is a puppet, but he was given the U.N.
[02:02:48.379 --> 02:02:49.360]  Peace Prize.
[02:02:49.360 --> 02:02:58.545]  They intended the whole time to make him the head of the rotating 15-member Security Council.
[02:02:58.545 --> 02:03:00.346]  It is the true position in the U.N.
[02:03:00.346 --> 02:03:00.946]  The U.S.
[02:03:00.946 --> 02:03:02.607]  always acts like it doesn't like the U.N.
[02:03:02.607 --> 02:03:07.090]  The United States in 1945 created at the Presidio Naval Base in
[02:03:08.180 --> 02:03:09.482]  San Francisco.
[02:03:09.482 --> 02:03:10.903]  It's run.
[02:03:10.903 --> 02:03:13.306]  Only the Security Council has power.
[02:03:13.306 --> 02:03:19.373]  The rest of it is a debating society to suck in the third world nations so that they can be paid off at the UN.
[02:03:22.009 --> 02:03:23.871]  And yes, it's a big deal.
[02:03:23.871 --> 02:03:29.757]  That's why on the back cover of the Obama deception, I'll show you a close shot of that, I make the point.
[02:03:29.757 --> 02:03:32.619]  President Obama has brazenly violated Article 1, Section 9 of the U.S.
[02:03:32.619 --> 02:03:37.304]  Constitution by seating himself at the head of the United Nations Security Council, thus becoming the first U.S.
[02:03:37.304 --> 02:03:38.925]  President to chair the world body.
[02:03:38.925 --> 02:03:45.071]  That's why Henry Kissinger and all these elitists were there, just in awe, and mouths were hanging open when he did it.
[02:03:45.071 --> 02:03:46.552]  Because this was
[02:03:47.625 --> 02:03:51.388]  The Associated Press said Obama brings us into the New World Order.
[02:03:51.388 --> 02:03:55.732]  I mean, this is serious, serious big medicine.
[02:03:55.732 --> 02:03:57.294]  Powerful medicine.
[02:03:57.294 --> 02:03:58.795]  And it's poison medicine.
[02:03:58.795 --> 02:04:05.941]  I mean, this is big wampum for the New World Order to do this.
[02:04:05.941 --> 02:04:09.745]  It is just such a big deal to
[02:04:11.451 --> 02:04:14.412]  Have Barack Obama do this, and they're just training us.
[02:04:14.412 --> 02:04:20.956]  NLE09, FEMA, 14 nations, foreign troops training to quote, take on American domestic terrorists.
[02:04:20.956 --> 02:04:25.198]  And we have the DHS manual, it's gun owners, veterans, conservatives.
[02:04:25.198 --> 02:04:26.638]  They're just throwing the gauntlet down.
[02:04:26.638 --> 02:04:28.359]  World government, new world order.
[02:04:28.359 --> 02:04:39.564]  Coming up, I'm gonna get into Ban Ki-moon, the head of the United Nations, in the New York Times, in an editorial, saying global government's here.
[02:04:39.564 --> 02:04:40.565]  We're gonna tax your butt.
[02:04:42.335 --> 02:04:43.116]  Here it is right here!
[02:04:43.116 --> 02:04:45.540]  It's coming up!
[02:04:45.540 --> 02:04:48.925]  PrisonPlanet.tv viewers can see it right here in front of me.
[02:04:48.925 --> 02:04:51.789]  We'll be back after this quick break.
[02:04:51.789 --> 02:04:53.271]  And we will continue with your phone calls.
[02:04:53.271 --> 02:04:55.093]  First, I'm going to do a news blitz.
[02:04:55.093 --> 02:04:56.375]  Stay with us, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:04:56.375 --> 02:04:57.297]  We shall prevail.
[02:05:00.748 --> 02:05:04.130]  Have you ever wanted to generate your own supply of electrical power?
[02:05:04.130 --> 02:05:07.752]  If so, this is going to be the most important message you will ever hear.
[02:05:07.752 --> 02:05:12.334]  Solar-powered generators are now available from Solutions from Science in Thompson, Illinois.
[02:05:12.334 --> 02:05:17.917]  These emergency backup systems provide life-saving electrical power when you need it most, unlike gas generators.
[02:05:18.217 --> 02:05:22.980]  A solar generator runs quietly, emits no fumes, and produces electricity for free.
[02:05:22.980 --> 02:05:26.602]  It's like having an electric power plant running quietly in your own home.
[02:05:26.602 --> 02:05:31.425]  Run sump pumps, shortwave radios, computers, and even keep food from spoiling.
[02:05:31.425 --> 02:05:37.989]  Whether it's hurricanes, ice storms, brownouts, or blackouts, you'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again.
[02:05:37.989 --> 02:05:39.930]  When the power goes out, you'll be ready.
[02:05:40.410 --> 02:05:43.613]  With a solar power generator from Solutions from Science.
[02:05:43.613 --> 02:05:48.118]  Go to MySolarBackup.com and get off the grid today!
[02:05:48.118 --> 02:05:50.340]  That's MySolarBackup.com or call 877-327-0365.
[02:05:50.340 --> 02:05:50.641]  877-327-0365.
[02:05:50.641 --> 02:05:51.381]  Don't wait, call today!
[02:06:01.411 --> 02:06:04.413]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[02:06:04.413 --> 02:06:09.758]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[02:06:09.758 --> 02:06:11.799]  My answer would be all I can get.
[02:06:11.799 --> 02:06:16.803]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[02:06:16.803 --> 02:06:17.724]  How much do you want?
[02:06:17.984 --> 02:06:19.105]  When do you want it?
[02:06:19.105 --> 02:06:20.986]  Now or after the battle starts?
[02:06:20.986 --> 02:06:22.067]  When will you need it?
[02:06:22.067 --> 02:06:24.268]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[02:06:24.268 --> 02:06:25.609]  Will there be any food?
[02:06:25.609 --> 02:06:27.130]  Will it make your children sick?
[02:06:27.130 --> 02:06:32.393]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[02:06:32.393 --> 02:06:35.996]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[02:06:35.996 --> 02:06:39.458]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[02:06:39.798 --> 02:06:41.019]  How much will you need?
[02:06:41.019 --> 02:06:41.919]  We don't know.
[02:06:41.919 --> 02:06:43.020]  How much do you want?
[02:06:43.020 --> 02:06:43.960]  All you can get.
[02:06:43.960 --> 02:06:45.061]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:06:45.061 --> 02:06:48.103]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[02:06:48.103 --> 02:06:50.344]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[02:06:50.344 --> 02:06:51.304]  Again that number 1-800-409-5633.
[02:07:00.342 --> 02:07:05.669]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[02:07:05.669 --> 02:07:10.195]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[02:07:10.195 --> 02:07:12.478]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[02:07:12.478 --> 02:07:14.100]  You don't have to cooperate.
[02:07:14.100 --> 02:07:15.122]  There is a solution.
[02:07:15.342 --> 02:07:23.785]  Inner Health Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.
[02:07:23.785 --> 02:07:31.228]  Try their inner food with 20 organic ingredients full of dense nutrition that gives you the energy you need and will keep you well.
[02:07:31.228 --> 02:07:36.890]  It even won the award for best superfood of 2009 from our friend Mike Adams, the health ranger.
[02:07:37.270 --> 02:07:43.293]  I love their Nutri-Cafe, great organic coffee infused with herbal extracts to boost your immune system.
[02:07:43.293 --> 02:07:47.435]  Try all of their truly honest products that will keep you alive and healthy.
[02:07:47.435 --> 02:07:54.898]  Go to enerfood.com or give them a call right now, 866-762-9238.
[02:07:54.898 --> 02:07:58.200]  Click on their banner at infowars.com to see all the available discounts.
[02:08:02.617 --> 02:08:09.249]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:08:09.249 --> 02:08:12.215]  It's Alex Jones, and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:27.879 --> 02:08:36.771]  Alright, number one in the news that I want to get into is this article from the New York Times from two days ago.
[02:08:36.771 --> 02:08:38.473]  This is from Sunday.
[02:08:38.473 --> 02:08:42.318]  We Can Do It by Ban Kai Moon.
[02:08:43.407 --> 02:08:45.949]  The United Nations does exist for new listeners.
[02:08:45.949 --> 02:08:50.593]  He is the Secretary General of an organization called the United Nations.
[02:08:50.593 --> 02:08:52.695]  This was created by private corporate interest.
[02:08:52.695 --> 02:08:59.461]  It is a private corporate body like the World Trade Organization, the Ex-Im Bank, the IMF, the World Bank.
[02:08:59.461 --> 02:09:02.804]  Its stated goal is to exterminate at least 80% of the population.
[02:09:04.827 --> 02:09:12.872]  Though extremists want total death of the human species and have pledged to kill themselves when they're the last human standing.
[02:09:12.872 --> 02:09:24.038]  And we've read the policy reports and gone over it here when I spoke out against Dr. Eric Bianca, the UT professor, saying he wants to kill 90% of the public with an airborne Ebola.
[02:09:24.038 --> 02:09:24.879]  When I covered that,
[02:09:27.566 --> 02:09:37.192]  I got emails and calls from his graduate students working in bioweapons and other areas of science, saying, hey, he's a liberal, he only wants to kill 90%.
[02:09:37.192 --> 02:09:39.793]  Humans are a parasite, we all must be killed.
[02:09:39.793 --> 02:09:51.240]  So remember that, that their main goal is eco-science, the government policy book, written by the White House science czar, calling for world population reduction, sterilization of the water and vaccines.
[02:09:51.240 --> 02:09:52.701]  Just remember that.
[02:09:52.701 --> 02:09:54.682]  Keep this book right here, because it's the most
[02:09:56.245 --> 02:10:02.948]  Yeah, 1100 pages, but most concise and the most honest book by these enemies of humanity.
[02:10:02.948 --> 02:10:12.312]  Now, he says in this article, we want to thank John Kerry, Senator John Kerry and Senator Lindsey Graham for their leadership.
[02:10:12.312 --> 02:10:14.132]  He says we are on the verge of the U.S.
[02:10:14.132 --> 02:10:20.135]  Senate, this is the head of the U.N., the head of the puppet U.N., the head of the General Assembly, Ban Ki-moon.
[02:10:23.493 --> 02:10:32.060]  And he says, we are on the verge of passing the global greenhouse gas emissions tax inside the United States.
[02:10:32.060 --> 02:10:37.645]  And that is in paragraph 5 of the article.
[02:10:37.645 --> 02:10:37.925]  U.S.
[02:10:37.925 --> 02:10:38.866]  leadership is crucial.
[02:10:39.810 --> 02:10:47.955]  That is why I'm encouraged by the spirit of compromise shown in the bipartisan initiative announced last week by Senator John Kerry and Senator Lindsey Graham.
[02:10:47.955 --> 02:10:48.816]  Here was a pair of U.S.
[02:10:48.816 --> 02:10:56.441]  Senators, one Republican, one Democrat, coming together to bridge their party's differences to address climate change in a spirit of genuine give-and-take.
[02:10:56.441 --> 02:10:59.122]  And he's the guy who attacks Ron Paul.
[02:10:59.122 --> 02:11:00.203]  He knows who his enemy is.
[02:11:00.203 --> 02:11:03.525]  Lindsey Graham is an abomination.
[02:11:03.525 --> 02:11:07.788]  He is an absolute, total, and complete abomination.
[02:11:07.788 --> 02:11:09.129]  He says one thing and does another.
[02:11:11.502 --> 02:11:15.724]  It says, every day this critical December summit in Copenhagen grows closer.
[02:11:15.724 --> 02:11:21.567]  All agree that climate change is an existential threat to humankind.
[02:11:21.567 --> 02:11:24.068]  This is a way to say humankind is bad.
[02:11:24.068 --> 02:11:27.710]  Yet, agreement on what to do seems to elude us still.
[02:11:27.710 --> 02:11:29.571]  It goes on.
[02:11:29.571 --> 02:11:36.915]  He says in the third to last paragraph, a deal must include an equitable global governance structure
[02:11:38.658 --> 02:11:42.421]  All countries must have a voice in how resources are deployed and managed.
[02:11:42.421 --> 02:11:48.966]  Oh yes, you'll have a voice within the UN, controlled by private banks, on where the resources go.
[02:11:48.966 --> 02:11:53.889]  That is how trust will be built.
[02:11:53.889 --> 02:11:56.111]  And it goes on from there.
[02:11:56.111 --> 02:11:59.053]  And they are seizing complete control of everything.
[02:11:59.053 --> 02:12:07.980]  And you search engine the term global governance, hundreds of articles a week say global government or global governance, thousands per week
[02:12:09.850 --> 02:12:16.773]  Say, New World Order, and then describe it, a private banking dictatorship that controls every facet of your lives.
[02:12:16.773 --> 02:12:26.398]  Let's together go to a search engine, Yahoo, startpage.com, Google, let's go to Google, and let's type in global governance and click news.
[02:12:26.398 --> 02:12:28.539]  Let's do it together on screen.
[02:12:28.539 --> 02:12:32.621]  Let's punch up the computer and type it in for everybody.
[02:12:32.621 --> 02:12:34.182]  Global governance.
[02:12:34.182 --> 02:12:38.904]  Now I had callers this morning when I was on a local talk station, calling and saying I'm making this up.
[02:12:40.011 --> 02:12:43.652]  Global governance does not exist.
[02:12:43.652 --> 02:12:49.574]  Now there's the New York Times, Ban Ki-moon, that's the second link.
[02:12:49.574 --> 02:12:52.735]  But how many articles with global governance in it?
[02:12:52.735 --> 02:12:55.256]  It says 1,013.
[02:12:55.256 --> 02:13:02.058]  In the second block, they always have the top story, the newest on top, then under that they have a block that says, in the last week,
[02:13:03.834 --> 02:13:06.195]  That's what that link shows, that bottom green link.
[02:13:06.195 --> 02:13:11.359]  The last week, in the last seven days, 1,013 articles.
[02:13:11.359 --> 02:13:14.040]  See, when I say hundreds a week, it's far worse.
[02:13:14.040 --> 02:13:16.602]  People say, oh, he just says hundreds or says dozens.
[02:13:16.602 --> 02:13:21.745]  Yeah, I mean, I don't normally have the number in front of me, so I'll just lowball it.
[02:13:21.745 --> 02:13:24.627]  I'll say that China killed 64 million people, that's what the U.S.
[02:13:24.627 --> 02:13:25.247]  government says.
[02:13:25.247 --> 02:13:26.608]  China says they killed 80 million.
[02:13:26.608 --> 02:13:31.090]  1,013 new articles.
[02:13:36.687 --> 02:13:42.271]  With the term global governance.
[02:13:42.271 --> 02:13:47.335]  And then there's a Los Angeles Times article, I mentioned another article about this yesterday out of England.
[02:13:47.335 --> 02:13:51.058]  Los Angeles Times, FIDO, aka the climate criminal.
[02:13:51.058 --> 02:14:03.267]  Here, let's click on today's top story from 11 hours ago about how your dog, under global governance... Print that for me, I haven't seen this one.
[02:14:03.267 --> 02:14:05.769]  I mean, I could spend a million hours a day, there's not enough hours in the day.
[02:14:07.469 --> 02:14:09.229]  This is my news blitz.
[02:14:09.229 --> 02:14:11.330]  I should just spend the rest of the show on this.
[02:14:11.330 --> 02:14:16.971]  They're going to tax every form of meat, every form of plastic, every form of energy, home inspections.
[02:14:16.971 --> 02:14:18.312]  They're going to tax concrete.
[02:14:18.312 --> 02:14:19.992]  They're going to tax asphalt.
[02:14:19.992 --> 02:14:24.653]  They are openly announcing they're going to tax restaurants, coal, thousands, thousands.
[02:14:24.653 --> 02:14:33.075]  The climate bill in the House that's passed the House, now in the Senate, says 35 bureaucracies can do anything they want.
[02:14:33.075 --> 02:14:35.596]  Just like the gun bills they've introduced under Holder.
[02:14:38.522 --> 02:14:43.844]  States that he can just ban any guns he wants or ban you owning a gun without it being arrested or charged.
[02:14:43.844 --> 02:14:44.724]  You just can't own a gun anymore.
[02:14:44.724 --> 02:14:46.405]  You're put on a secret list.
[02:14:46.405 --> 02:14:52.047]  That's what they do now in these articles.
[02:14:52.047 --> 02:14:53.328]  This is how they operate.
[02:14:53.328 --> 02:14:56.069]  This is what they're up to.
[02:14:56.069 --> 02:15:00.991]  And no exaggeration, thousands of articles a day.
[02:15:02.501 --> 02:15:04.042]  State what they're going to tax.
[02:15:04.042 --> 02:15:06.604]  This is going to be hell.
[02:15:06.604 --> 02:15:08.725]  And they mean for you to go bankrupt.
[02:15:08.725 --> 02:15:12.808]  I always get calls and emails saying, well, who are they going to tax if they bankrupt us all?
[02:15:12.808 --> 02:15:13.969]  They print the money.
[02:15:13.969 --> 02:15:16.891]  They use the taxing system to destroy independence.
[02:15:16.891 --> 02:15:20.554]  The power to tax is the power to destroy, as Thomas Jefferson said.
[02:15:23.875 --> 02:15:24.836]  I don't know.
[02:15:42.799 --> 02:15:52.087]  Now come on, we do need to tax cars, and oil, and your house, and beef, and the crops you grow, because they're putting off carbon dioxide.
[02:15:52.087 --> 02:15:54.649]  Plants don't just put off oxygen.
[02:15:54.649 --> 02:15:56.010]  And yes, the plants are bad.
[02:15:56.010 --> 02:16:02.275]  I can pull up articles right now where they're talking about cutting trees down now.
[02:16:02.275 --> 02:16:03.776]  You can't make this up.
[02:16:03.776 --> 02:16:05.197]  In fact, people don't believe that.
[02:16:05.197 --> 02:16:10.602]  Jarren, search the term, environmental activists say trees
[02:16:13.055 --> 02:16:14.295]  Oh, I'm not joking.
[02:16:14.295 --> 02:16:14.836]  Trees are evil, too.
[02:16:14.836 --> 02:16:16.676]  Trees are poison.
[02:16:31.530 --> 02:16:46.695]  But FIDO, aka the climate criminal, some climate change activist, and it goes on, rather than come up with solutions that can actually work, so see, oh, we do believe carbon dioxide's a deadly poison, even though plants breathe it, and then they create oxygen humans breathe.
[02:16:46.695 --> 02:16:51.517]  We can't scare you with the word oxygen, so we'll scare you with the word carbon dioxide.
[02:16:51.517 --> 02:16:53.378]  The government cannot have my dog.
[02:16:53.378 --> 02:16:54.418]  And then it goes on.
[02:16:54.418 --> 02:16:57.439]  And this is being called for by the United Nations.
[02:17:00.839 --> 02:17:07.259]  And here in my stack, here's a Times of London, Climate Chief Lord Stern, give up meat to save the planet!
[02:17:08.018 --> 02:17:10.179]  And they're banning fireplaces.
[02:17:10.179 --> 02:17:11.580]  They're banning space heaters.
[02:17:11.580 --> 02:17:14.261]  But don't worry, California just wants to tax them.
[02:17:14.261 --> 02:17:18.744]  Oh, you can have the propane heater in Northern California on cold nights.
[02:17:18.744 --> 02:17:19.904]  You're just gonna pay a tax.
[02:17:19.904 --> 02:17:23.726]  And we're gonna come in your house with local inspectors that get part of the money.
[02:17:23.726 --> 02:17:28.349]  Because these little chicken-neck control freaks, they like to boss people around.
[02:17:28.349 --> 02:17:31.070]  These were the Tattletail Rats in school.
[02:17:31.070 --> 02:17:32.951]  And they are getting SWAT teams.
[02:17:32.951 --> 02:17:35.332]  And if you don't like it, they're gonna murder you and your family.
[02:17:35.332 --> 02:17:36.373]  After all, you're bad for the Earth.
[02:17:37.537 --> 02:17:43.078]  People will need to turn vegetarian in if the world is to conquer climate change according to leading authority on global warming.
[02:17:43.078 --> 02:17:45.059]  And it's being proposed.
[02:17:45.059 --> 02:17:46.479]  In fact, they've already started.
[02:17:46.479 --> 02:17:50.220]  Canada's now taxing cows.
[02:17:50.220 --> 02:17:52.180]  In fact, Google that.
[02:17:52.180 --> 02:17:56.401]  Canada... Just Google a tax on cows.
[02:17:56.401 --> 02:18:01.262]  A lot of sheep farmers and beef farmers in New Zealand and Australia are just stopping.
[02:18:01.262 --> 02:18:03.223]  Hundreds of dollars per cow.
[02:18:03.223 --> 02:18:05.243]  Fifty-something dollars to seventy-plus dollars.
[02:18:09.540 --> 02:18:10.181]  Oh, look at that!
[02:18:10.181 --> 02:18:12.443]  They'd shoot trees, wouldn't they?
[02:18:12.443 --> 02:18:15.986]  Climate law encourages deforestation, scientists say.
[02:18:15.986 --> 02:18:20.550]  A law of unintended consequences strikes again.
[02:18:20.550 --> 02:18:22.311]  The Kyoto Protocol.
[02:18:22.311 --> 02:18:29.697]  And then it gets into, I guess, how trees are evil, but that's not the exact headline I wanted.
[02:18:29.697 --> 02:18:31.519]  And this is meant to be outrageous.
[02:18:31.519 --> 02:18:35.883]  And then you're a criminal if you deny that it's happening.
[02:18:35.883 --> 02:18:36.263]  You're bad.
[02:18:37.654 --> 02:18:39.716]  If you deny that this is going on.
[02:18:39.716 --> 02:18:42.718]  You are evil if you deny that this is going on.
[02:18:42.718 --> 02:18:44.039]  You are wrong.
[02:18:44.039 --> 02:18:45.039]  You are racist.
[02:18:45.039 --> 02:18:46.600]  Oh, I don't like big government.
[02:18:46.600 --> 02:18:47.741]  Racist.
[02:18:47.741 --> 02:18:49.102]  Oh, I don't think we should have open borders.
[02:18:49.102 --> 02:18:49.883]  Racist.
[02:18:49.883 --> 02:18:51.084]  I don't want government-run healthcare.
[02:18:51.084 --> 02:18:51.404]  Racist.
[02:18:51.404 --> 02:18:55.667]  I was watching some congresswoman back there in the break room earlier when I was getting some java.
[02:18:56.596 --> 02:19:06.040]  And she was on there saying, there's a woman waiting for a heart transplant and she won't get it, and there's a girl waiting for a kidney transplant and she won't get it because of this blah, blah, blah.
[02:19:06.040 --> 02:19:10.302]  England, Australia, Canada, they all have longer waiting lists for these things than the United States.
[02:19:10.302 --> 02:19:12.483]  We have one of the fastest systems in the world.
[02:19:12.483 --> 02:19:14.144]  It's not perfect.
[02:19:14.144 --> 02:19:21.908]  I was on the radio this morning on another talk show, and the talk show was like, yeah, but the insurance companies, they don't want the government healthcare.
[02:19:21.908 --> 02:19:23.949]  The insurance companies wrote the stinking thing.
[02:19:25.017 --> 02:19:27.258]  See, everything is the opposite.
[02:19:27.258 --> 02:19:31.800]  The big oil companies wrote the carbon tax laws.
[02:19:31.800 --> 02:19:32.601]  They want it.
[02:19:32.601 --> 02:19:35.142]  They want to shut down their competition cold.
[02:19:35.142 --> 02:19:36.783]  That's on record.
[02:19:36.783 --> 02:19:46.167]  Just look at all the advertisements in the newspapers and magazines and TV from BP and ExxonMobil and Dutch Royal Shell calling for carbon taxes.
[02:19:46.167 --> 02:19:48.068]  I was in the airport in Los Angeles.
[02:19:48.068 --> 02:19:54.311]  Half the billboards in the concourse were about carbon taxes and it was all oil companies and computer companies pushing it.
[02:19:56.357 --> 02:19:58.388]  We'll be right back with more news.
[02:19:58.388 --> 02:19:59.876]  Your calls and Lindsey Williams.
[02:19:59.876 --> 02:20:00.318]  Stay with us.

[02:21:01.383 --> 02:21:03.546]  Why are you letting that search engine spy on you?
[02:21:03.546 --> 02:21:04.407]  Spy on me?
[02:21:04.407 --> 02:21:04.728]  Yeah.
[02:21:04.728 --> 02:21:09.775]  Don't you know Google, Yahoo, and other search engines record all your searches and store them in a giant database?
[02:21:09.775 --> 02:21:11.418]  You should use Startpage instead.
[02:21:11.418 --> 02:21:12.159]  Startpage?
[02:21:12.159 --> 02:21:12.579]  Yeah.
[02:21:12.579 --> 02:21:13.681]  Startpage.com.
[02:21:13.681 --> 02:21:16.405]  The new name for Ixquik, the world's most private search engine.
[02:21:16.625 --> 02:21:20.491]  They don't record your searches or your IP address, and the search results are great.
[02:21:20.491 --> 02:21:23.615]  Plus, StartPage is third-party certified, and it's totally free.
[02:21:23.615 --> 02:21:26.238]  I don't want Big Brother watching what I do on the internet.
[02:21:26.238 --> 02:21:27.841]  I'm adding StartPage to my browser.
[02:21:27.841 --> 02:21:28.141]  Right!

[02:21:31.466 --> 02:21:32.968]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones.
[02:21:33.368 --> 02:21:37.230]  There are some habits you need to break if you want to hold on to your privacy.
[02:21:37.230 --> 02:21:41.011]  That's why I'm inviting you to take the one-week StartPage challenge.

[02:22:03.018 --> 02:22:04.479]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[02:22:04.479 --> 02:22:10.524]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold for your IRA?
[02:22:10.524 --> 02:22:11.345]  That's right.
[02:22:11.345 --> 02:22:13.947]  Gold has been available to be placed in IRAs since 1986.
[02:22:13.947 --> 02:22:21.113]  Yet still, the financial industry refuses to recognize the value of real hard assets for your retirement.
[02:22:21.673 --> 02:22:29.816]  The truth be told, gold and silver has outperformed paper investments like stocks, bonds, and CDs, yet no word about IRAs.
[02:22:29.816 --> 02:22:35.299]  Perhaps the financial institutions want to maintain control of your assets by keeping you in paper.
[02:22:35.299 --> 02:22:38.320]  If you'd like to take a look at gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[02:22:41.101 --> 02:22:45.605]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low return on your paper investments.
[02:22:45.605 --> 02:22:45.885]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:22:45.885 --> 02:22:47.867]  Make sure that you secure your future.
[02:22:47.867 --> 02:22:48.467]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:22:48.467 --> 02:22:48.768]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[02:22:48.768 --> 02:22:48.988]  You worry.
[02:23:02.372 --> 02:23:04.434]  You see the signs and worry about the future.
[02:23:04.434 --> 02:23:07.076]  You worry about economic turmoil and food shortages.
[02:23:07.076 --> 02:23:09.197]  How to be prepared while preserving your sanity?
[02:23:09.197 --> 02:23:10.818]  Your answer may be at hand.
[02:23:10.818 --> 02:23:14.401]  Author Linda Runyon lived off the land, isolated from civilization.
[02:23:14.401 --> 02:23:19.645]  She knows that as long as the sun shines, there will be plenty of free food all over God's green earth.
[02:23:19.645 --> 02:23:23.628]  Perhaps the only sane insurance is knowledge of wild edible plants.
[02:23:23.628 --> 02:23:25.309]  The cost of learning is minimal.
[02:23:25.309 --> 02:23:28.212]  Wild food grows everywhere and you will see it everywhere.
[02:23:28.212 --> 02:23:31.154]  It's every bit organic and more nutritious than our modern diets.
[02:23:31.656 --> 02:23:40.301]  Well respected in her field, Linda's approach to teaching this subject includes books, flashcards, and video with an emphasis on health, safety, practicality, and joy.
[02:23:40.301 --> 02:23:45.123]  Learn how to identify it, where and when to find it, how to prepare, use, and store it.
[02:23:45.123 --> 02:23:49.146]  Go to Linda's website, ofthefield.com, and take advantage of special offers.
[02:23:49.146 --> 02:23:54.969]  Or if you're not online, call her 24-hour, toll-free order line at 888-51-EAT-FREE.
[02:23:54.969 --> 02:23:58.371]  That number again, 888-51-EAT-FREE.
[02:23:58.371 --> 02:24:00.392]  A little knowledge makes starvation impossible.
[02:24:03.530 --> 02:24:28.602]  The breacher man says it's the end of time And the Mississippi River, she's a gold mine The interest is up and the stock market's down And you're only getting mugged if you go downtown I live back in the woods, you see I live back in the woods, you see
[02:24:29.332 --> 02:24:32.355]  Yeah, country boys are putting fluoride in your water now.
[02:24:32.355 --> 02:24:33.275]  Brain damaging you.
[02:24:33.275 --> 02:24:36.698]  Gonna stand up against that?
[02:24:57.227 --> 02:24:59.949]  But can you keep your kids off Prozac and Ritalin?
[02:24:59.949 --> 02:25:00.869]  I've seen the statistics.
[02:25:00.869 --> 02:25:05.532]  They put more kids out in the country in this nation on drugs than anybody else.
[02:25:05.532 --> 02:25:08.214]  These country folks worship their doctors.
[02:25:08.214 --> 02:25:09.875]  They don't wake up to that.
[02:25:09.875 --> 02:25:21.002]  I want to play three minutes from my film, Follow the Republic, right now.
[02:25:21.002 --> 02:25:24.665]  But first we've got to crank this part up, right here.
[02:25:24.665 --> 02:25:26.246]  Because you can't make us run.
[02:25:28.287 --> 02:25:45.361]  Alright, let's go ahead and go to a clip from Foal the Republic dealing with Barack Obama becoming the chairman of the UN Security Council.
[02:25:45.361 --> 02:25:47.683]  For anybody out there who's in denial, here it is.
[02:25:48.888 --> 02:26:00.299]  The finance heads of the 20 industrialized nations met again in late September of 2009 at the G20 Summit in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.
[02:26:00.299 --> 02:26:08.266]  At that meeting, ministers called for an end to the dollar as the world reserve currency.
[02:26:08.266 --> 02:26:13.892]  They also called for a strengthening of global governance and called for a new world order
[02:26:15.814 --> 02:26:31.591]  While the bankers were busy carving up the world at the G20 Summit, Barack Obama was in New York City at the United Nations because he's got a new job to chair the United Nations Security Council, the most powerful position in the world government body.
[02:26:31.591 --> 02:26:33.553]  President Obama does what no other U.S.
[02:26:33.553 --> 02:26:34.974]  president ever has.
[02:26:36.496 --> 02:26:38.598]  President Obama presided over the U.N.'
[02:26:38.578 --> 02:26:40.340]  's most powerful body.
[02:26:40.340 --> 02:26:44.223]  That would be the Security Council.
[02:26:44.223 --> 02:26:45.805]  6,191st meeting of the Security Council.
[02:26:45.805 --> 02:26:50.249]  For a couple of hours, you could say Mr. Obama was president of the world.
[02:26:50.249 --> 02:26:54.893]  It is the story of a world that understands that no difference or division is worth destroying.
[02:26:54.893 --> 02:27:00.298]  All that we have built in my own country, it has brought Democrats and Republican leaders together.
[02:27:00.959 --> 02:27:01.259]  We're good.
[02:27:21.258 --> 02:27:23.602]  Any foreign government or institution.
[02:27:23.602 --> 02:27:28.350]  He swears an oath to protect and defend the Constitution of the United States.
[02:27:28.350 --> 02:27:34.300]  But now Barack Obama has sworn allegiance to the global government and the United Nations that he heads up.
[02:27:35.365 --> 02:27:37.827]  Let that sink in real good.
[02:27:37.827 --> 02:27:42.891]  Barack Obama now heads the United Nations Security Council.
[02:27:42.891 --> 02:27:46.094]  You cannot serve two masters, and Obama isn't.
[02:27:46.094 --> 02:27:51.238]  He's selling out the last vestiges of sovereignty that this country had.
[02:27:51.238 --> 02:27:55.362]  This, ladies and gentlemen, is the destruction of our nation, and it's also high treason.
[02:27:59.833 --> 02:28:02.974]  Obama's lies are obvious and out in the open.
[02:28:02.974 --> 02:28:04.754]  He hides in plain sight.
[02:28:04.754 --> 02:28:08.855]  And from the moment he took office, his lies have only increased.
[02:28:08.855 --> 02:28:19.898]  Despite the fact that his ratings have dramatically dropped since election day, from the mid 80s to the low 40s, a large portion of Americans still gullibly hang on his every word.
[02:28:19.898 --> 02:28:23.339]  It is bringing entertainment to thousands of people.
[02:28:23.339 --> 02:28:29.140]  Through its magic, we are able to enjoy a combination of the radio, motion pictures, and the stage,
[02:28:30.171 --> 02:28:33.073]  Right in the comfort of our own homes.
[02:28:33.073 --> 02:28:37.417]  Simply by pushing a button and turning a dial.
[02:28:37.417 --> 02:28:41.940]  These cells with their electrical charges are scanned by a stream of electrons.
[02:28:41.940 --> 02:28:45.483]  Completing 30 pictures a second.
[02:28:45.483 --> 02:28:49.086]  Compare that crude picture with these of today.
[02:28:49.930 --> 02:28:55.793]  And you can judge for yourself how far along the road to perfection television has traveled.
[02:28:55.793 --> 02:29:06.118]  Most people still today think that all entertainment to do with movies, drama, is there for nothing more than their entertainment.
[02:29:06.118 --> 02:29:08.259]  It never ever was that case.
[02:29:08.259 --> 02:29:14.902]  Of course, television can't perform such miracles as this, yet.
[02:29:14.902 --> 02:29:17.624]  But perhaps there's no harm wishing that it could.
[02:29:19.744 --> 02:29:26.969]  The greatest social messages are promoted through movies and drama, high drama... Alright.
[02:29:26.969 --> 02:29:39.399]  ...through the fixation of emotive sequences... Yeah, they knew men ran society at the local level, and the state didn't want that, so the messages about TV and culture were, men, you're in charge, the women are your slaves.
[02:29:39.399 --> 02:29:48.505]  That was the message in the 50s, and the CIA has declassified, it was meant to enrage women to then rebel in the 60s so they could break the family up.
[02:29:48.505 --> 02:29:49.166]  Now they've done it.
[02:29:51.897 --> 02:29:54.903]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[02:29:54.903 --> 02:29:58.510]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:00.759 --> 02:30:10.886]  This is Alex Jones, and I want to tell you all about Ecola Blue, the state-of-the-art atmospheric water generators that produces purified drinking water right from the humidity in the air you breathe.
[02:30:10.886 --> 02:30:12.487]  No, this isn't science fiction.
[02:30:12.487 --> 02:30:13.568]  It's very real.
[02:30:13.568 --> 02:30:13.928]  I know.
[02:30:13.928 --> 02:30:18.152]  I use one every day in my own home, and it's available right now to you.
[02:30:18.152 --> 02:30:21.374]  Clean, great-tasting water, without all the pollutants.
[02:30:21.374 --> 02:30:29.580]  Make the decision today to claim your own water independence by ordering or own a Ecola Blue atmospheric water generator for your home or business, just like I did.
[02:30:30.020 --> 02:30:36.708]  Their best seller, the Ecola Blue 28, produces up to 7 gallons of water every day and is easy to use and economical.
[02:30:36.708 --> 02:30:44.899]  This system is free of chemicals and uses a multi-stage filtration system, including reverse osmosis, carbon filters, and ultraviolet lights.
[02:30:45.399 --> 02:30:52.765]  Generate your own pure water right from the humidity in the air by calling a Coloblue at 1-800-691-6043.
[02:30:52.765 --> 02:30:55.527]  That's 1-800-691-6043.
[02:30:55.527 --> 02:31:00.711]  Or visit a Coloblue on the web at E-C-O-L-O-B-L-U-E dot com today.
[02:31:00.711 --> 02:31:05.254]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:31:05.254 --> 02:31:05.835]  Number one.
[02:31:06.155 --> 02:31:10.438]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:31:10.438 --> 02:31:15.342]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:31:15.342 --> 02:31:16.082]  It's true.
[02:31:16.082 --> 02:31:21.767]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:31:21.767 --> 02:31:25.369]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:31:25.369 --> 02:31:29.072]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:31:29.272 --> 02:31:30.052]  Number 4.
[02:31:30.052 --> 02:31:32.813]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:31:32.813 --> 02:31:36.495]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:31:36.495 --> 02:31:37.295]  Number 5.
[02:31:37.295 --> 02:31:41.437]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:31:41.437 --> 02:31:46.499]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[02:31:46.499 --> 02:31:50.660]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[02:31:50.660 --> 02:31:52.461]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[02:31:52.461 --> 02:31:57.063]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-866-422-9000.
[02:31:59.745 --> 02:32:00.605]  877-327-0365.
[02:32:00.605 --> 02:32:08.331]  Have you heard that millionaire, entrepreneur, businessman, your congressional candidate, and author Robert Beatles wrote a new book called Here's What You Do?
[02:32:08.331 --> 02:32:17.098]  You can buy it at here'swhatyoudo.net as an e-book for six bucks or the book for ten bucks and we have an audio book on its way for you commuters as well.
[02:32:17.378 --> 02:32:23.664]  Here's What You Do tells you exactly what to do to survive and thrive in these harsh economic times.
[02:32:23.664 --> 02:32:27.728]  This book will work for anyone, rich, poor, middle class, it doesn't matter.
[02:32:27.728 --> 02:32:33.034]  This book truly has the information that can make you wealthy and it will tell you how to protect your wealth as well.
[02:32:33.334 --> 02:32:35.416]  You know the government isn't looking out for you.
[02:32:35.416 --> 02:32:37.178]  You need to look out for yourself.
[02:32:37.178 --> 02:32:39.701]  The economy is bad, but it's probably going to get worse.
[02:32:39.701 --> 02:32:44.426]  You must prepare and make sure you are able to financially take care of yourself and your loved ones.
[02:32:44.426 --> 02:32:48.150]  Go to here'swhatyoudo.net and start today.
[02:32:48.150 --> 02:32:51.273]  Again, it is here'swhatyoudo.net.
[02:32:51.273 --> 02:32:53.175]  That's here'swhatyoudo.net.
[02:32:53.175 --> 02:32:55.277]  One last time, it's here'swhatyoudo.net.
[02:33:09.394 --> 02:33:12.496]  The Republic is falling now.
[02:33:12.496 --> 02:33:16.779]  Open world government is being heralded from the rooftops.
[02:33:16.779 --> 02:33:23.003]  You are being told that what you eat, everything you do, your dog, your cat, it's all going to be taxed.
[02:33:23.003 --> 02:33:24.364]  You're going to be taxed.
[02:33:24.364 --> 02:33:26.186]  You are a climate criminal.
[02:33:26.186 --> 02:33:29.948]  Carbon dioxide is a deadly chemical weapon.
[02:33:29.948 --> 02:33:31.009]  Trees are now evil.
[02:33:32.059 --> 02:33:46.770]  The globalists want it to be nonsensical and insane and have people parroting it as they dump toxic waste in the rivers and clear-cut and genetic engineer with cross-species and plant it everywhere as they inoculate and mutate the population with chemical and bioweapons.
[02:33:46.770 --> 02:33:50.013]  We're going to go to Lindsey Williams for the next hour.
[02:33:50.013 --> 02:33:52.215]  I know we have callers already holding.
[02:33:52.215 --> 02:33:54.416]  That doesn't matter.
[02:33:54.416 --> 02:33:57.038]  Because Lindsey can speak about any issue.
[02:33:57.038 --> 02:33:59.941]  We're going to take nothing but calls for Lindsey Williams in the next hour.
[02:34:00.796 --> 02:34:02.617]  That's why we have him back here.
[02:34:02.617 --> 02:34:07.620]  I'm going to briefly recap that in a moment, and we're going directly to Lindsey Williams for the next hour.
[02:34:07.620 --> 02:34:13.724]  Then I got a news blitz in the last 30 minutes today on the economy and the dollar and the police state issues I haven't gotten to.
[02:34:13.724 --> 02:34:20.488]  I did just spend the last 20 minutes or so, as promised, getting into the global government and the global carbon taxes that are being announced.
[02:34:20.488 --> 02:34:24.150]  Before I go any further, I want to tell you about the sponsors that made today's show possible.
[02:34:25.486 --> 02:34:27.531]  I want to let you know about Diginet.net.
[02:34:27.531 --> 02:34:30.238]  D-I-G-A-N-E-T dot net.
[02:34:30.238 --> 02:34:33.084]  They have a whole bunch of great units, like a hidden video pin.
[02:34:34.113 --> 02:34:35.313]  Or you just press one button.
[02:34:35.313 --> 02:34:37.834]  It's the ease of use that's so key with these.
[02:34:37.834 --> 02:34:42.094]  And it records hours and hours, depending on which unit you get, two to four hours.
[02:34:42.094 --> 02:34:46.595]  It has one to two channels available and records video and audio.
[02:34:46.595 --> 02:34:48.976]  Great for use with the police and others.
[02:34:48.976 --> 02:34:50.756]  So there's a true record of what happened.
[02:34:50.756 --> 02:34:56.977]  So they beat you almost half to death and then say that you were really Al Qaeda and that you sprouted vampire fangs and venom.
[02:34:56.977 --> 02:34:59.237]  You're going to have the evidence that that didn't really happen.
[02:34:59.237 --> 02:35:02.078]  Diginet.net, they have hidden camera sunglasses.
[02:35:02.618 --> 02:35:07.759]  It's all solid state, little bitty chip in them, and a little hidden camera.
[02:35:07.759 --> 02:35:08.400]  888-344-6681.
[02:35:08.400 --> 02:35:08.640]  888-344-6681.
[02:35:08.640 --> 02:35:13.261]  Diginet.net, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:35:13.261 --> 02:35:16.702]  Check them out today.
[02:35:16.702 --> 02:35:18.682]  Also, MySolarBackup.com.
[02:35:18.682 --> 02:35:20.503]  A lot of things can cut off your electrical power.
[02:35:20.503 --> 02:35:22.123]  Hurricanes, snow, ice storms.
[02:35:22.123 --> 02:35:25.604]  Listeners should move towards getting off the grid, and here's a good way to do just that.
[02:35:25.604 --> 02:35:29.325]  A solar power generator has been available for some time, and our listeners love it.
[02:35:29.325 --> 02:35:31.486]  From our longtime sponsor, Solutions from Science.
[02:35:31.946 --> 02:35:40.070]  You get an emergency power backup kit which consists of the power source, 800 watt generator, and a high-efficiency solar panel designed to provide endless electricity.
[02:35:40.070 --> 02:35:46.093]  Remember, too, that gas generators need gas, but in a blackout, gas pumps can't pump gas because they run on electricity.
[02:35:46.093 --> 02:35:48.794]  It's the perfect emergency backup for troubled times.
[02:35:48.794 --> 02:35:52.035]  The government doesn't own the sun yet, folks, so make your move today.
[02:35:52.035 --> 02:35:58.158]  MySolarBackup.com, that's MySolarBackup.com, one word, or give the great folks at MySolarBackup.com a call, 877-327-0368.
[02:36:01.880 --> 02:36:02.860]  Five.
[02:36:02.860 --> 02:36:05.521]  Okay, let me just recap.
[02:36:05.521 --> 02:36:14.945]  Lindsey Williams broke on this radio show last Monday, Tuesday, and Friday in successive one-hour interviews.
[02:36:14.945 --> 02:36:23.268]  The inside scoop from a former major top ten oil company executive that he got to know when he worked with him decades ago.
[02:36:23.268 --> 02:36:27.910]  Lindsey had the number one video on YouTube and Google off and on for months.
[02:36:27.910 --> 02:36:29.211]  Every week it was in the top ten.
[02:36:30.669 --> 02:36:39.377]  Tens of millions of views as he presented how there was enough oil to run the United States over and over and over again, a lot more than Saudi Arabia.
[02:36:39.377 --> 02:36:43.580]  He talked about that 20-something years ago with his best-selling book, The Energy Non-Crisis.
[02:36:43.580 --> 02:36:46.263]  And the guy called up and said, look, you're going to die.
[02:36:46.263 --> 02:36:49.906]  We're going to basically kill you if you don't shut up about this.
[02:36:49.906 --> 02:36:51.367]  But you can tell your people this.
[02:36:52.208 --> 02:36:57.572]  How they were going to lower oil prices from 150 a barrel to below 50 for the next year, and that indeed did happen.
[02:36:57.572 --> 02:37:05.797]  Lindsey got laughed at at the time when oil was at $147 when he premiered that information on Dr. Stan Monteith and then my show.
[02:37:05.797 --> 02:37:15.423]  Now, he talked to this gentleman who almost died recently, again, a couple weeks ago, and he broke the news here on our radio show, and we're very thankful for that.
[02:37:15.423 --> 02:37:19.286]  And I believe his story, and it fits in with all the MO I already have from their open announcements.
[02:37:20.533 --> 02:37:26.018]  But I want listeners to get a chance to ask your questions of Lindsey Williams.
[02:37:26.018 --> 02:37:29.061]  So, I know Vanessa, Victor, Amber, Dayton, Derek, everybody.
[02:37:29.061 --> 02:37:32.203]  I know you were already there before he came on.
[02:37:32.203 --> 02:37:32.584]  Doesn't matter.
[02:37:32.584 --> 02:37:33.465]  He can talk about all the issues.
[02:37:33.465 --> 02:37:38.789]  He's been fighting the Globeless for decades because he worked in and around them and with them, so he found out about it back in the 70s.
[02:37:38.789 --> 02:37:41.051]  We're going to have open phones.
[02:37:41.051 --> 02:37:44.754]  As soon as you hear a caller hang up, you can call in with your question only for Lindsey Williams.
[02:37:45.698 --> 02:37:48.841]  Alex, thank you for allowing me the privilege of being on your show this morning.
[02:37:48.841 --> 02:37:51.543]  Now, just before we went on air, I went on my computer to YouTube
[02:38:02.930 --> 02:38:05.092]  Congratulations, Alex.
[02:38:05.092 --> 02:38:11.076]  The most watched video on YouTube this morning, this hour, is Fall of the Republic.
[02:38:11.076 --> 02:38:16.579]  Alex, if anybody in America is ever going to turn this country around, it's going to be Alex Jones.
[02:38:16.579 --> 02:38:17.980]  Congratulations.
[02:38:17.980 --> 02:38:19.021]  I am so proud of you.
[02:38:19.021 --> 02:38:19.921]  I don't know what to do.
[02:38:19.921 --> 02:38:22.263]  I have watched your Fall of the Republic.
[02:38:22.263 --> 02:38:25.185]  Every person has got to get a copy of it.
[02:38:25.185 --> 02:38:29.408]  Copy it a thousand times, folks, and give it out to everybody you know.
[02:38:29.408 --> 02:38:30.949]  Alex, congratulations.
[02:38:31.308 --> 02:38:32.548]  Well, thank you, Lindsey.
[02:38:32.548 --> 02:38:42.312]  Yes, there are two director accounts, Change the Channel and one other, that have the full version uploaded, and I tell listeners that, and we're going to do a big promotion next week, promoting, getting it out to everybody.
[02:38:42.312 --> 02:38:45.793]  Maybe now is the time, because I did see it was already number one, I didn't mention that.
[02:38:45.793 --> 02:38:46.774]  That's just one version.
[02:38:46.774 --> 02:38:48.554]  There are over a thousand versions.
[02:38:48.554 --> 02:38:58.338]  If you Google, Follow the Republic, there's over, that was last night, a thousand versions of it, with ten thousand, a hundred thousand, three hundred thousand, four hundred thousand, two hundred thousand.
[02:38:58.338 --> 02:38:58.778]  It's already
[02:38:59.638 --> 02:39:03.682]  Several million last night, and I had like five minutes and counted up a few of the big ones.
[02:39:03.682 --> 02:39:07.865]  So, in five, six days, we launched it last Wednesday, so that's six days.
[02:39:07.865 --> 02:39:08.766]  Millions and millions.
[02:39:08.766 --> 02:39:11.128]  It's over two million views, conservatively.
[02:39:11.128 --> 02:39:13.530]  Very, very exciting with all the different versions.
[02:39:13.530 --> 02:39:17.373]  A strawman attack will be, well, this one only says 300,000, or this one only says 200,000.
[02:39:17.373 --> 02:39:18.173]  It's all of them together.
[02:39:18.934 --> 02:39:20.155]  Over 2 million.
[02:39:20.155 --> 02:39:28.221]  And like Obama deception, you'll go see 4 million here, a million there, 2 million here, half a million there, 100,000 here.
[02:39:28.221 --> 02:39:32.004]  It's over 20 million, just from what I've counted, months ago.
[02:39:32.004 --> 02:39:33.786]  But that's Obama deception.
[02:39:33.786 --> 02:39:34.627]  So thank you, Lindsey.
[02:39:34.627 --> 02:39:35.968]  And I want to say this to you, Pastor.
[02:39:37.182 --> 02:39:40.583]  And we've got to hurry and go to calls, because that's what we promised to have you here for today, and we're very blessed to have you.
[02:39:40.583 --> 02:39:49.205]  Maybe you could stay a little bit longer than past the half hour, though I have a news blitz coming up, so we can get to more of these, because I'm already going to you late here, but I want to just say this.
[02:39:49.205 --> 02:39:52.826]  The New World Order has created a counterfeit of Christianity.
[02:39:52.826 --> 02:40:02.149]  A Christianoid, as my uncle calls it, fake Christianity, of all the little glitter bugs and the rest of them up there on the screen, as Jack McClam calls them, to discredit
[02:40:03.436 --> 02:40:06.118]  Real Christianity and the teachings of Jesus.
[02:40:06.118 --> 02:40:16.747]  And you look at everything being fulfilled in prophecy, you look at all the reality and the great delusion how folks wouldn't know it was the Antichrist when it came because of the rap, you know, just all this propaganda.
[02:40:16.747 --> 02:40:24.574]  But I want to say this, God has really been working with me to be more focused, more professional, because I do have this great responsibility and I do recognize
[02:40:25.868 --> 02:40:36.792]  That unfortunately, it's a very dangerous position because they have tried to set me up and destroy me and I cheerfully take my licks, wherever they are, that I am the greatest threat to the New World Order.
[02:40:36.792 --> 02:40:39.233]  It's a crazy statement, but it's true.
[02:40:39.233 --> 02:40:42.074]  Because my listeners are the greatest threat to the New World Order.
[02:40:42.074 --> 02:40:43.495]  Next to Ron Paul.
[02:40:43.495 --> 02:40:44.755]  We're right up there with Ron Paul.
[02:40:44.755 --> 02:40:46.576]  Kind of twin peaks, as they say.
[02:40:47.723 --> 02:40:57.474]  And I've been praying every night to help me be more articulate, to help me be more honorable, to help me not be as worldly, to help me not be as obnoxious, to help me not lose my temper.
[02:40:57.474 --> 02:41:01.118]  And I just am overwhelmed and saying, why me God?
[02:41:01.118 --> 02:41:03.941]  But the discernment and everything God's opened up to me,
[02:41:05.069 --> 02:41:08.774]  It's a great comfort but also very painful to be able to understand what's happening.
[02:41:08.774 --> 02:41:09.936]  I know you're a lot older than I am.
[02:41:09.936 --> 02:41:21.171]  A pastor who's been fighting the globalists for almost 30 years and it's just amazing when you turn yourself over to God and just say, God help me be a vessel, a tool to fight tyranny.
[02:41:21.171 --> 02:41:22.192]  What God has done with
[02:41:22.973 --> 02:41:24.854]  Alex, I'm so proud of you.
[02:41:24.854 --> 02:41:25.254]  You can't imagine.
[02:41:25.254 --> 02:41:27.394]  When I heard, only days ago, from the elite.
[02:41:27.394 --> 02:41:31.055]  Now, you didn't use the word elite a moment ago, but I'm going to use it now.
[02:41:53.058 --> 02:42:06.225]  When I heard from one of them just a few days ago and what he said, everything you're doing, what you just got through saying, he said within two years we will not recognize America.
[02:42:06.225 --> 02:42:08.747]  Time is of the essence.
[02:42:08.747 --> 02:42:17.632]  Again, this elite told me after two years you will be so poor you will not be able to do anything.
[02:42:17.632 --> 02:42:19.153]  This is startling.
[02:42:19.153 --> 02:42:21.114]  He went on down to talk about
[02:42:21.966 --> 02:42:24.868]  2012, the dollar will be dead.
[02:42:24.868 --> 02:42:26.730]  We're talking two years.
[02:42:26.730 --> 02:42:31.073]  Again, he said war is planned after two years.
[02:42:31.073 --> 02:42:37.058]  He said inflation is going to escalate over a period of two years.
[02:42:37.058 --> 02:42:45.545]  And then the elite made it very plain that they have, he used this term, devil's messiah of a system.
[02:42:47.489 --> 02:42:50.832]  All of these things the Elite have planned, they know what they're doing.
[02:42:50.832 --> 02:42:59.740]  Let me stress, as powerful as I possibly can, there positively is a group of people out there that control the world.
[02:42:59.740 --> 02:43:02.863]  Everything you've heard on the Alex Jones Show is true.
[02:43:02.863 --> 02:43:09.149]  I only have the privilege of being on every now and then, but what Alex says every single day, I can back it up.
[02:43:09.149 --> 02:43:12.852]  I lived, I was the chaplain for the Elite for three years.
[02:43:13.405 --> 02:43:17.587]  On the Trans-Alaska Oil Pipeline, I lived with these people for three years.
[02:43:17.587 --> 02:43:20.168]  Very few people even get to know one of them.
[02:43:20.168 --> 02:43:24.230]  But by the providence of God, I had the privilege of living with them.
[02:43:24.230 --> 02:43:28.032]  Everything Alex Jones says about these people is true.
[02:43:28.032 --> 02:43:28.772]  I know.
[02:43:28.772 --> 02:43:29.473]  I lived it.
[02:43:29.473 --> 02:43:30.333]  I saw it.
[02:43:30.333 --> 02:43:32.294]  I sat across the dinner table from them.
[02:43:32.294 --> 02:43:34.375]  Alex, I am so proud of you.
[02:43:34.375 --> 02:43:35.355]  I don't know what to say.
[02:43:35.355 --> 02:43:37.236]  I just wish... Well, no, I'm proud of you.
[02:43:37.236 --> 02:43:42.419]  And, Pastor, I'm actually humbled because I've tried to whitewash
[02:43:43.510 --> 02:43:47.753]  Paper over how important the position I'm in because I don't want that.
[02:43:47.753 --> 02:43:53.537]  I don't have this high view of myself and I know that it's not Alex Jones that's helped wake up all these people.
[02:43:53.537 --> 02:44:00.542]  It was God working through me and my great listeners and we're involved in the most important thing that we could be.
[02:44:00.542 --> 02:44:04.424]  I've got the most important job that anybody could have.
[02:44:04.424 --> 02:44:07.707]  You have the most important job anybody could have.
[02:44:07.707 --> 02:44:08.968]  A old washerwoman
[02:44:09.828 --> 02:44:14.709]  Talking to our neighbors about the New World Order and about global tax has the most important job.
[02:44:14.709 --> 02:44:19.391]  We are fighting pure, unadulterated death.
[02:44:19.391 --> 02:44:20.891]  Total destruction.
[02:44:20.891 --> 02:44:22.111]  Kill, steal and destroy.
[02:44:22.111 --> 02:44:23.112]  That is the enemy.
[02:44:23.112 --> 02:44:24.792]  Kill, steal and destroy.
[02:44:24.792 --> 02:44:26.373]  That's like a big robot.
[02:44:26.373 --> 02:44:27.913]  Kill, steal, destroy.
[02:44:27.913 --> 02:44:29.454]  That's what eco-science says.
[02:44:29.454 --> 02:44:31.334]  That's what the globalists are pushing.
[02:44:31.334 --> 02:44:34.055]  Let's go to phone calls, Lindsey.
[02:44:34.055 --> 02:44:34.635]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:44:35.011 --> 02:44:35.431]  You bet.
[02:44:35.431 --> 02:44:36.452]  Good to have you here.
[02:44:36.452 --> 02:44:39.034]  Vanessa, you can address myself or Lindsey, but let's move quickly.
[02:44:39.034 --> 02:44:41.455]  Vanessa, thanks for holding her on the air.
[02:44:41.455 --> 02:44:42.216]  Hi, Alex.
[02:44:42.216 --> 02:44:45.018]  It's such an honor to speak with you and Lindsey today.
[02:44:45.018 --> 02:44:47.900]  So happy to be able to speak with you.
[02:44:47.900 --> 02:44:49.261]  Well, it's an honor to speak with you.
[02:44:49.261 --> 02:44:51.002]  Ma'am, go ahead.
[02:44:51.002 --> 02:44:56.125]  Well, thank you for shifting my paradigm, and it's made me a better parent and a better patriot.
[02:44:56.125 --> 02:45:03.630]  And I just want you to know that I'm going to be giving out copies of your Ball of the Republic to every trick-or-treater at my door this Halloween.
[02:45:03.630 --> 02:45:04.271]  That's a good idea.
[02:45:05.207 --> 02:45:09.010]  Yes, along with some information about the flu vaccine.
[02:45:09.010 --> 02:45:11.431]  And I understand this is a little bit off topic.
[02:45:11.431 --> 02:45:13.152]  I was on hold before.
[02:45:13.152 --> 02:45:13.653]  No, it's not.
[02:45:13.653 --> 02:45:14.053]  Go ahead.
[02:45:14.053 --> 02:45:15.994]  Lindsay can comment on this.
[02:45:15.994 --> 02:45:21.758]  Okay, I just wanted to know what your opinion was of this or your thoughts.
[02:45:21.758 --> 02:45:24.660]  It's really disturbing to me.
[02:45:24.660 --> 02:45:28.282]  Our school district in the area is performing reverse 911 type calls.
[02:45:30.051 --> 02:45:31.011]  Yes.
[02:45:31.011 --> 02:45:48.279]  They call up and tell you, we had an incident at the school today, or a storm may be coming, and the feds reported in the late 80s, they want to have all of us, where radios, TVs, even if they're not plugged in, they have transponders in them, by law they're beginning to put in them, where they're going to take over and make announcements.
[02:45:48.279 --> 02:45:52.841]  Yes, and they're promoting the free vaccines for public high schools.
[02:45:52.841 --> 02:45:56.543]  So you're getting automated phone calls, or are they having human beings call you?
[02:45:56.543 --> 02:45:59.344]  No, they are automated, and they're calling cell phones too.
[02:46:00.069 --> 02:46:01.590]  Robot calls, man.
[02:46:01.590 --> 02:46:20.946]  Yes, and I just, it's really scary and the last thing I want to say, and I'll let you go because I know you've got a lot of people to get to, they had a military helicopter land in our local elementary school's playground during school hours and made it part of an assembly, brought the kids out there, they were armed,
[02:46:22.239 --> 02:46:25.100]  And it sounds reasonable, but it's done to acclimate.
[02:46:25.100 --> 02:46:33.422]  Anderson High, where I graduated in 1993, they had an Army Reserve General, was the principal.
[02:46:33.422 --> 02:46:43.305]  And the year after I left, Roger Raessler, the younger brother of Alex and Nate Raessler, became a U2 football player, good friend of mine, he called me and said,
[02:46:44.298 --> 02:46:48.742]  Because I was already talking about the New World Order by the time I was a freshman in college.
[02:46:48.742 --> 02:46:51.024]  He said, you wouldn't believe it, Alex.
[02:46:51.024 --> 02:46:58.671]  They landed a helicopter and announced over the school, and this happened my last day of school too, or two days before, they landed a Cobra.
[02:46:58.671 --> 02:47:01.714]  But they said, they announced, this is your New World Order.
[02:47:01.714 --> 02:47:05.977]  And they had Marines take over, Hobbs Middle School, Pensacola, Florida, we have those articles.
[02:47:07.418 --> 02:47:13.461]  1998, and then the Marines took over the classrooms and said, the President wants you to know what martial law is like.
[02:47:13.461 --> 02:47:24.805]  In fact, guys, search engine, InfoWars.com, Helicopters Anderson High, Black Helicopter Anderson High, something like that.
[02:47:24.805 --> 02:47:31.808]  You'll see photos that we posted, because not only did Roger Reisler call me,
[02:47:34.776 --> 02:47:42.381]  But, then, I got sent photos years later of it happening again.
[02:47:42.381 --> 02:47:45.603]  I'm now remembering the whole story, but thank you for the call.
[02:47:45.603 --> 02:47:47.044]  I appreciate it.
[02:47:47.044 --> 02:47:50.506]  Lindsey Williams, your comment on the acclamation of the military taking over America.
[02:47:50.506 --> 02:47:53.008]  The elitists talk with me about this.
[02:47:53.008 --> 02:47:54.989]  I am so glad your caller brought this up.
[02:47:54.989 --> 02:47:56.970]  They call it the Devil's Messiah.
[02:47:56.970 --> 02:47:58.071]  Now, they have a word for it.
[02:47:58.724 --> 02:48:00.445]  Normally, you probably wouldn't hear this.
[02:48:00.445 --> 02:48:03.887]  It goes all the way back to what they've done to our schools.
[02:48:03.887 --> 02:48:07.349]  It goes to the humanism that was brought in by evolution.
[02:48:07.349 --> 02:48:09.570]  They have subverted the churches.
[02:48:09.570 --> 02:48:19.235]  Oh my goodness, in my new DVD set, I talk about what is done to the churches because I've been a pastor for 50 years or minister of the gospel, so I go into that.
[02:48:19.235 --> 02:48:23.158]  Every bit of this is a part of what the latest talk with me about.
[02:48:23.158 --> 02:48:25.799]  I think I dealt with part of this on your program last week.
[02:48:26.252 --> 02:48:28.994]  So, how far you'd like us to go?
[02:48:28.994 --> 02:48:29.674]  They did.
[02:48:29.674 --> 02:48:34.498]  This is their program.
[02:48:34.498 --> 02:48:35.358]  We'll continue.
[02:48:35.358 --> 02:48:36.699]  Let's get to some more of the calls, though.
[02:48:36.699 --> 02:48:37.260]  That's important.
[02:48:37.260 --> 02:48:41.583]  The total takeover of society through the schools and churches, that's been declassified.
[02:48:41.583 --> 02:48:44.925]  Victor in California, you're on the air with Lindsey Williams.
[02:48:44.925 --> 02:48:46.126]  How you doing, Alex?
[02:48:46.126 --> 02:48:46.406]  Good.
[02:48:46.406 --> 02:48:48.248]  Alex?
[02:48:48.248 --> 02:48:48.468]  Yes?
[02:48:48.468 --> 02:48:49.308]  I'm Victor.
[02:48:49.308 --> 02:48:53.211]  I'm a veteran from Iraq and Afghanistan.
[02:48:53.211 --> 02:48:55.613]  I served in Fort Bragg and
[02:48:56.149 --> 02:49:02.755]  I was just looking over this, on the internet, it says The Dome.
[02:49:02.755 --> 02:49:04.877]  Under The Dome by Stephen King.
[02:49:04.877 --> 02:49:12.985]  And it was on an exclusive PopEater.com interview with him.
[02:49:12.985 --> 02:49:19.831]  And I was wondering, because I noticed that The Simpsons had The Dome on their cartoon.
[02:49:20.518 --> 02:49:22.720]  And now this is coming out.
[02:49:22.720 --> 02:49:27.463]  Yes, it's predictive programming where they condition you that you've got to go under quarantine.
[02:49:27.463 --> 02:49:35.209]  They've got scores of TV shows about disaster, martial law, all so you're comfortable with it and almost expect it.
[02:49:35.209 --> 02:49:37.110]  Like, I keep hearing about this movie.
[02:49:37.110 --> 02:49:38.511]  I want to go see it now.
[02:49:38.511 --> 02:49:39.632]  So you're expecting it.
[02:49:39.632 --> 02:49:46.818]  You know, it's kind of like when you're growing up in middle school and the bully is saying, I'm going to be waiting for you when you get off the bus.
[02:49:48.103 --> 02:49:54.765]  You almost are glad when you're pulling up in the bus and you see him waiting over in the edge of the woods.
[02:49:54.765 --> 02:49:56.206]  You're almost glad to get it over with.
[02:49:56.206 --> 02:49:58.407]  You're almost glad when he finally punches you.
[02:49:58.407 --> 02:50:00.147]  Because now you can get it going.
[02:50:00.147 --> 02:50:01.688]  And that's the acclamation.
[02:50:01.688 --> 02:50:02.948]  And Lindsey talked about that.
[02:50:02.948 --> 02:50:05.289]  The Elite told him two weeks ago the same thing.
[02:50:05.289 --> 02:50:08.831]  We're using movies to condition you, Lindsey.
[02:50:08.831 --> 02:50:13.512]  Yes, they gave me a schedule of events in chronological order.
[02:50:13.512 --> 02:50:15.213]  I'm still sitting back startled.
[02:50:16.242 --> 02:50:18.643]  I think I gave those also in your program last week.
[02:50:18.643 --> 02:50:29.625]  A schedule of events in chronological order of their countdown according to their new altered timeline of approximately two years.
[02:50:29.625 --> 02:50:31.765]  And every bit of this is planned in advance.
[02:50:31.765 --> 02:50:37.166]  And I think probably, Alex, the only reason this gentleman gave me this is because he's over 85 years of age.
[02:50:37.166 --> 02:50:39.306]  He almost died last winter.
[02:50:39.306 --> 02:50:42.067]  Once you become a part of the elite, you never get away from them.
[02:50:42.660 --> 02:50:46.523]  And by the providence of God, I've known this man now for about 30 years.
[02:50:46.523 --> 02:50:48.484]  A number of times I've talked to him on the phone.
[02:50:48.484 --> 02:50:56.989]  When he gave me this only days ago, I was utterly appalled to know the entire plan of the elite for the next 30 years.
[02:50:56.989 --> 02:50:57.810]  All right, stay there.
[02:50:57.810 --> 02:51:00.291]  We're going to come back to Amber, Dayton, Derek, Matt, and others.
[02:51:00.291 --> 02:51:00.732]  Stay with us.
[02:51:01.502 --> 02:51:10.207]  Of the three million plus edible food plants that grow on earth, no other single plant can compare with the nutritional value of the powder, seeds, and oil of the hemp plant.
[02:51:10.207 --> 02:51:16.191]  At hempusa.org, we ship worldwide these nutritional products with free shipping to the US and Canada.
[02:51:16.191 --> 02:51:22.735]  At hempusa.org, we want to educate our listeners that edible hemp is not marijuana and is certified THC-free.
[02:51:23.300 --> 02:51:26.701]  Our powder is 50% protein and does not contain gluten.
[02:51:26.701 --> 02:51:29.142]  Gluten impairs the cells from absorbing nutrients.
[02:51:29.142 --> 02:51:35.725]  This nutrient-dense food can be stored up to five years when vacuum-packed and is priced affordably to be used as a storable food.
[02:51:35.725 --> 02:51:39.266]  HempUSA.org is a bulk shipper starting with five pounds and up.
[02:51:39.266 --> 02:51:41.067]  To allow this food to work for you, call 908-
[02:51:42.007 --> 02:51:46.309]  Call 908-691-2608 or go to hempusa.org and order today.
[02:51:46.309 --> 02:51:49.470]  The body will react and heal itself given the proper nutrition.
[02:51:49.470 --> 02:51:51.671]  This superfood will be your greatest asset.
[02:51:51.671 --> 02:51:55.333]  So try it today, store it today, and change your life.
[02:51:55.333 --> 02:51:56.473]  Call 908-691-2608 or order from hempusa.org.
[02:52:02.210 --> 02:52:06.233]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:52:06.233 --> 02:52:09.475]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:52:09.475 --> 02:52:14.639]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[02:52:14.639 --> 02:52:20.683]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:52:20.683 --> 02:52:22.905]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[02:52:23.445 --> 02:52:24.666]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[02:52:24.666 --> 02:52:26.588]  And right now in Washington DC, we have seen
[02:52:47.988 --> 02:52:49.629]  A Fall of the Republic.
[02:52:49.629 --> 02:53:01.193]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:53:01.193 --> 02:53:05.474]  Thomas Jefferson once said, when the people fear their government, there is tyranny.
[02:53:05.474 --> 02:53:08.735]  When the government fears the people, there is liberty.
[02:53:08.735 --> 02:53:16.538]  Our God-given right to life and liberty and the right to determine what is best for our lives and our family's health are in jeopardy if we the people
[02:53:16.798 --> 02:53:17.318]  We're good to go.
[02:53:38.288 --> 02:53:38.548]  Let's do it!
[02:54:06.949 --> 02:54:09.591]  As promised, Lindsey Williams is here taking your calls.
[02:54:09.591 --> 02:54:16.815]  We're almost through the calls it was holding on other issues, but everything the callers bring up ties into what Lindsey's been discussing.
[02:54:16.815 --> 02:54:19.197]  Amber in New York, you're on the air worldwide.
[02:54:19.197 --> 02:54:19.657]  Go ahead.
[02:54:19.657 --> 02:54:21.779]  Hi, Alex.
[02:54:21.779 --> 02:54:28.183]  I just wanted to thank you for being so strong for everybody and leading us through this trying time in our country.
[02:54:28.183 --> 02:54:30.845]  Well, ma'am, I hope I can live up to it.
[02:54:30.845 --> 02:54:34.307]  I'm just an average person, an example of what we can all do, but go ahead.
[02:54:35.285 --> 02:54:54.920]  Um, I wanted to know if you knew anything about, um, I live in Southern New York, and we have, um, these guys that pulled up a couple weeks ago and took out trucks and they tagged our driveway with a big, shiny address, you know, and it's on everybody's property.
[02:54:54.920 --> 02:55:03.287]  But the scarier thing is there's so much FEMA, um, posters up, like at the stores on the windows and, um,
[02:55:05.680 --> 02:55:16.326]  They're just training you to see posters about spying on your neighbors, and posters how the government wants to help you, and posters how the government loves you, and half the billboards.
[02:55:16.326 --> 02:55:17.107]  I'm not exaggerating.
[02:55:17.107 --> 02:55:18.628]  I'm going to do a piece on this for YouTube.
[02:55:18.628 --> 02:55:22.090]  Drive around and go, let's just randomly drive down a road and show the billboards.
[02:55:22.090 --> 02:55:23.090]  Tattle on your neighbors.
[02:55:23.090 --> 02:55:24.811]  Tattle on your kids.
[02:55:24.811 --> 02:55:27.012]  Don't use drugs.
[02:55:27.012 --> 02:55:28.173]  The government's your boss.
[02:55:28.173 --> 02:55:28.533]  It's like 1984.
[02:55:28.533 --> 02:55:30.655]  I appreciate your call.
[02:55:30.655 --> 02:55:34.337]  The elite are clearly bringing in a major police state, Lindsey Williams.
[02:55:34.337 --> 02:55:34.557]  Why?
[02:55:35.549 --> 02:55:39.550]  Oh, they positively are, because the name of the game is control.
[02:55:39.550 --> 02:55:43.151]  I've said it for 35 years since I've lived with these people.
[02:55:43.151 --> 02:55:44.451]  That's all they're after.
[02:55:44.451 --> 02:55:53.273]  You know, some of the people that I was with on the Trans-Alaska Oil Pipeline, they could have written a check for a million dollars a day for the rest of their life and never spent their fortunes.
[02:55:53.273 --> 02:56:03.555]  Everything is about control of people, control of nations, control of currencies, and it's control, not necessarily just dollars and cents, even though that's a part of their program.
[02:56:04.128 --> 02:56:10.653]  And everything imaginable in our society today is geared to programming people mentally.
[02:56:10.653 --> 02:56:18.219]  It's a psychological battle to prepare them for their timeline.
[02:56:18.219 --> 02:56:18.879]  Absolutely.
[02:56:18.879 --> 02:56:21.581]  Let's go ahead and take another phone call.
[02:56:21.581 --> 02:56:24.323]  Let's speak to... Thank you, Amber.
[02:56:24.323 --> 02:56:25.845]  Dayton in Louisiana.
[02:56:25.845 --> 02:56:27.646]  You're on the air, Dayton.
[02:56:27.646 --> 02:56:32.790]  Well, I want to thank you and Linda for being patriotic and trying to help our country out of this mess we're in.
[02:56:33.502 --> 02:56:39.568]  I'm a veteran of World War II, 84 years old, and I've lived in the best days of our country.
[02:56:39.568 --> 02:56:44.732]  But some of you younger people have got to stand up or we're going to lose everything we fought for.
[02:56:44.732 --> 02:56:49.377]  But I want to again thank both of you guys for doing what you're doing, and God bless you.
[02:56:49.377 --> 02:56:50.117]  Well, God bless you.
[02:56:50.117 --> 02:56:52.940]  Do you have any questions for Lindsey?
[02:56:52.940 --> 02:56:56.083]  Well, a lot of callers just want to thank us, and I want to explain something.
[02:56:57.452 --> 02:57:10.777]  We need your support and we appreciate it, but I need everybody just to warn the girls about how the Gardasil shot's killing them, how the flu shots are already killing and maiming people, how global government's being set up.
[02:57:10.777 --> 02:57:12.657]  I don't deserve a lot of thanks.
[02:57:12.657 --> 02:57:16.859]  How could I know this information and not warn people?
[02:57:16.859 --> 02:57:22.221]  I mean, it's common sense, and I'm not saying I don't like being thanked, but I mean, how do you know
[02:57:23.220 --> 02:57:30.723]  That they're putting poison in the water supply and bragging about it in government documents and not get upset, Lindsey Williams?
[02:57:30.723 --> 02:57:37.366]  Well, that's exactly the reaction I took here a few days ago when this individual gave me all this that literally shattered me.
[02:57:37.366 --> 02:57:40.067]  I mean, I was stunned.
[02:57:40.067 --> 02:57:44.349]  And the first thing that came to my mind, Alex, is just what you said just then.
[02:57:44.349 --> 02:57:52.093]  Can I, Lindsey Williams, sit here with this information told to me by one of the elite and do nothing about it?
[02:57:52.093 --> 02:57:52.413]  I said no.
[02:57:53.323 --> 02:57:58.004]  I must put my reputation on the line just as I did two years ago when you said it's going from $147 to $50.
[02:57:58.004 --> 02:58:11.026]  And I said, well, if the reputation has been established, maybe, maybe some of those people out there in America will listen to what I've got to say now on this new information.
[02:58:11.026 --> 02:58:16.027]  Yeah, same action, Alex, that you have.
[02:58:16.027 --> 02:58:17.487]  We'll be back with the final hour.
[02:58:17.487 --> 02:58:20.028]  More calls for Lindsey Williams.
[02:58:20.028 --> 02:58:21.248]  Derek in New Mexico.
[02:58:21.248 --> 02:58:22.028]  Matt in Texas.
[02:58:23.092 --> 02:58:28.696]  And many others straight ahead at 1-800-259-9231.
[02:58:28.696 --> 02:58:34.641]  Big news blitz coming up near the end of the show on a host of other economic news.
[02:58:34.641 --> 02:58:38.864]  And the Washington Times and Politico have been attacking me.
[02:58:38.864 --> 02:58:42.767]  I'll get into that.
[02:58:42.767 --> 02:58:46.509]  You are listening to GCN.
[02:58:46.509 --> 02:58:48.531]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[02:58:52.188 --> 02:58:55.850]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:58:55.850 --> 02:58:59.452]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:58:59.452 --> 02:59:04.254]  As they're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[02:59:04.254 --> 02:59:10.638]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:59:10.638 --> 02:59:12.879]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[02:59:13.439 --> 02:59:13.719]  Tim Geithner?
[02:59:13.719 --> 02:59:14.239]  Bernanke?
[02:59:14.239 --> 02:59:15.039]  They're arsonists!
[02:59:15.039 --> 02:59:16.180]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:59:16.180 --> 02:59:18.420]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:59:32.324 --> 02:59:34.446]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[02:59:34.446 --> 02:59:39.590]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the republic.
[02:59:39.590 --> 02:59:54.142]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:59:54.142 --> 02:59:56.524]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:59:56.524 --> 02:59:59.287]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[03:00:09.578 --> 03:00:12.479]  Lindsey Williams is our guest for another 40 minutes or so.
[03:00:12.479 --> 03:00:16.280]  He's taking your phone calls today.
[03:00:16.280 --> 03:00:23.623]  Let's go ahead and talk to... Who's up next here, John?
[03:00:23.623 --> 03:00:25.183]  Derek in New Mexico.
[03:00:25.183 --> 03:00:26.303]  Derek, you're on the air.
[03:00:26.303 --> 03:00:27.384]  Welcome.
[03:00:27.384 --> 03:00:28.284]  Hey, Alex.
[03:00:28.284 --> 03:00:29.004]  Hello, sir.
[03:00:29.004 --> 03:00:30.565]  I'm not gonna thank you anymore.
[03:00:30.565 --> 03:00:32.946]  I just wanted to get to some issues locally.
[03:00:32.946 --> 03:00:33.586]  I'm calling from, um...
[03:00:34.269 --> 03:00:35.310]  Albuquerque, New Mexico.
[03:00:35.310 --> 03:00:42.273]  And over here, man, it's propaganda everywhere with the DUIs, with the cops.
[03:00:42.273 --> 03:00:46.215]  If you've heard about the interlock, have you guys heard about the interlock here in New Mexico?
[03:00:46.215 --> 03:00:46.976]  Tell us about it.
[03:00:46.976 --> 03:00:54.060]  I have heard about it in other parts of the country, but the issue is, it's all about their good, we're bad, all the citizens are suspects.
[03:00:54.060 --> 03:00:55.681]  Oh, we're just big kids, Alex.
[03:00:55.681 --> 03:00:58.662]  We're just big kids that need to be told what to do.
[03:00:58.662 --> 03:00:59.383]  You know what I mean?
[03:00:59.383 --> 03:01:03.705]  And I was just wondering if we as a citizen can do something like recall every
[03:01:04.190 --> 03:01:07.832]  Official, just like Arnold did with his little stunt, recalling everybody.
[03:01:07.832 --> 03:01:12.073]  Why can't we recall local, state, federal, everybody?
[03:01:12.073 --> 03:01:15.335]  Because they're not doing the job for us anymore, at all.
[03:01:15.335 --> 03:01:16.515]  Well, they don't want to do the job.
[03:01:16.515 --> 03:01:17.736]  They want to suck off of you.
[03:01:17.736 --> 03:01:20.977]  But tell folks about the interlock.
[03:01:20.977 --> 03:01:26.660]  The interlock is something that you have to put the device in your car, meaning you have to blow into it to start your vehicle.
[03:01:26.660 --> 03:01:30.621]  You drink, even though it's American, it's a free country, you want to have a drink?
[03:01:30.621 --> 03:01:32.422]  No, you're going to have to have an interlock in your car.
[03:01:33.046 --> 03:01:33.806]  You know what I mean?
[03:01:33.806 --> 03:01:36.888]  Now, I know that DUI is a problem, but they're overblowing it.
[03:01:36.888 --> 03:01:38.229]  You know what I mean?
[03:01:38.229 --> 03:01:49.935]  Yeah, they're saying they want all cars to spy on you, guilty until proven innocent, with a sensor for alcohol
[03:01:50.595 --> 03:01:54.618]  Guilty until proven innocent, and now cameras they want in all cars.
[03:01:54.618 --> 03:01:57.160]  If the car's too hot, a child might get in it.
[03:01:57.160 --> 03:02:02.505]  All of you have to be watched by a police camera tied in with a cell phone that digitally transmits.
[03:02:02.505 --> 03:02:10.451]  Lindsey Williams, this complete control grid, face scanning cameras, license plate reading cameras, it's all going in.
[03:02:10.451 --> 03:02:19.038]  Yes, when I heard from this elite just days ago, he actually let me know that the elite are laughing at the gullible, stupid American.
[03:02:19.038 --> 03:02:20.019]  Now, forgive me, folks.
[03:02:20.683 --> 03:02:23.105]  That's exactly what they think we are.
[03:02:23.105 --> 03:02:32.951]  And if action is not taken immediately, our children, our grandchildren, and our great-great-grandchildren will forever be slaves to the elite.
[03:02:32.951 --> 03:02:34.652]  Because they think they have it made.
[03:02:34.652 --> 03:02:36.673]  I don't think they do.
[03:02:36.673 --> 03:02:42.417]  And it's only because of people like Alex Jones and others and Fall of the Republic.
[03:02:42.417 --> 03:02:49.001]  Oh my goodness, if ever we've got to do something, we have it now because they have altered that timeline
[03:02:49.443 --> 03:02:52.046]  And they know what they're going to do and when they're going to do it.
[03:02:52.046 --> 03:02:55.689]  Alex, it's all planned.
[03:02:55.689 --> 03:02:56.310]  Absolutely.
[03:02:56.310 --> 03:02:59.693]  Let's take another call here right now.
[03:02:59.693 --> 03:03:03.616]  Let's go to Matt in Texas.
[03:03:03.616 --> 03:03:04.998]  Matt, you're on the air.
[03:03:04.998 --> 03:03:12.345]  Hey Alex, Lindsey, I just wanted to say God bless the both of you and I just want to tell you all to keep fighting the good fight.
[03:03:14.781 --> 03:03:22.863]  And we pray, you know, me and my wife pray that every day that God builds the protection, the hedge around both of your families stronger than ever.
[03:03:22.863 --> 03:03:27.424]  And I just have a couple of quick points to make.
[03:03:27.424 --> 03:03:36.447]  I'm not going to go off into some biblical rant or anything like that, but this is addressed to Lindsay and you both, Alex.
[03:03:36.447 --> 03:03:37.747]  This is very, very important.
[03:03:38.223 --> 03:03:46.170]  My wife and I, we've studied in the Greek and Hebrew manuscripts for many, many years now, and my point is this.
[03:03:46.170 --> 03:03:49.653]  I'm only going to mention one biblical verse, and that's all.
[03:03:49.653 --> 03:03:50.774]  Okay, we're almost out of time.
[03:03:50.774 --> 03:03:52.956]  You don't have to apologize for it, sir.
[03:03:52.956 --> 03:03:53.596]  Okay.
[03:03:53.596 --> 03:04:01.123]  In Genesis 3.15, there are two seed lines that are talked about, one being Adam's and the other being Cain's.
[03:04:01.123 --> 03:04:05.847]  And what our studies are here is that these two seed lines, the Cain
[03:04:06.496 --> 03:04:07.336]  We're good to go.
[03:04:24.286 --> 03:04:43.663]  And all through the Bible, it talks about that they're builders of cities, that they're the heads of states, the kings, the queens, and they're using these tools, the four hidden dynasties, once again, you know, the political, the religious, the financial, and the educational system to steer this planet into affairs.
[03:04:43.663 --> 03:04:47.806]  And I'll suggest to everybody out there, it's K-E-N-I-T-E-S.
[03:04:47.806 --> 03:04:50.549]  Research these guys, the Kennites, through the sons of Cain,
[03:04:51.580 --> 03:04:53.663]  And they're... they're the bad guys.
[03:04:53.663 --> 03:04:54.704]  They're the ones that are controlling...
[03:05:01.581 --> 03:05:04.602]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[03:05:04.602 --> 03:05:09.924]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[03:05:09.924 --> 03:05:11.965]  My answer would be all I can get.
[03:05:11.965 --> 03:05:16.966]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[03:05:16.966 --> 03:05:18.147]  How much do you want?
[03:05:18.147 --> 03:05:19.287]  When do you want it?
[03:05:19.287 --> 03:05:21.148]  Now or after the battle starts?
[03:05:21.148 --> 03:05:22.228]  When will you need it?
[03:05:22.228 --> 03:05:24.429]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[03:05:24.429 --> 03:05:25.769]  Will there be any food?
[03:05:25.769 --> 03:05:27.090]  Will it make your children sick?
[03:05:27.290 --> 03:05:32.557]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[03:05:32.557 --> 03:05:36.162]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[03:05:36.162 --> 03:05:39.987]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[03:05:39.987 --> 03:05:41.209]  How much will you need?
[03:05:41.209 --> 03:05:42.110]  We don't know.
[03:05:42.110 --> 03:05:43.211]  How much do you want?
[03:05:43.211 --> 03:05:44.153]  All you can get.
[03:05:44.153 --> 03:05:44.954]  I'm Alex Jones.
[03:05:45.214 --> 03:05:48.276]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[03:05:48.276 --> 03:05:50.058]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[03:05:50.058 --> 03:05:50.958]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[03:06:00.523 --> 03:06:10.631]  This is Alex Jones, and I want to tell you all about Ecola Blue, the state-of-the-art atmospheric water generators that produces purified drinking water right from the humidity in the air you breathe.
[03:06:10.631 --> 03:06:12.253]  No, this isn't science fiction.
[03:06:12.253 --> 03:06:13.314]  It's very real.
[03:06:13.314 --> 03:06:13.674]  I know.
[03:06:13.674 --> 03:06:17.897]  I use one every day in my own home, and it's available right now to you.
[03:06:17.897 --> 03:06:21.120]  Clean, great-tasting water without all the pollutants.
[03:06:21.120 --> 03:06:29.327]  Make the decision today to claim your own water independence by ordering or own a Ecola Blue atmospheric water generator for your home or business, just like I did.
[03:06:29.767 --> 03:06:36.452]  Their best seller, the Ecolablue 28, produces up to 7 gallons of water every day and is easy to use and economical.
[03:06:36.452 --> 03:06:45.179]  This system is free of chemicals and uses a multi-stage filtration system, including reverse osmosis, carbon filters, and ultraviolet lights.
[03:06:45.179 --> 03:06:49.883]  Generate your own pure water right from the humidity in the air by calling Ecolablue at 1-800-691-6043.
[03:06:49.883 --> 03:06:50.103]  That's 1-800-691-6043.
[03:06:50.103 --> 03:06:51.244]  Or visit Ecolablue on the web
[03:06:57.809 --> 03:07:06.933]  Hi, it's MZ wondering how many of us Alex Jones fans intend to take the swine flu vaccine.
[03:07:06.933 --> 03:07:10.414]  I'm not, don't trust it, but then I don't want to get the disease either.
[03:07:10.414 --> 03:07:16.136]  So I use PureWorks, a unique disinfectant that comes in foam or spray form.
[03:07:16.136 --> 03:07:18.697]  PureWorks is not your typical hand disinfectant.
[03:07:18.697 --> 03:07:23.239]  There is no alcohol to dry your skin and it lasts for hours, not minutes.
[03:07:23.239 --> 03:07:25.960]  Use PureWorks to protect yourself from disease and infection.
[03:07:26.420 --> 03:07:32.146]  You can find out all about it and order it online at NoGerms.info.
[03:07:32.146 --> 03:07:34.408]  That's NoGerms.info.
[03:07:34.408 --> 03:07:42.957]  Don't introduce potentially dangerous chemicals or toxins into your body to keep you well when they could actually cause the sickness you want to avoid.
[03:07:42.957 --> 03:07:43.978]  Don't pick your nose.
[03:07:44.338 --> 03:07:48.899]  Don't shake hands, and don't handle banisters, rails, and doorknobs.
[03:07:48.899 --> 03:07:54.021]  Do try PureWorks, available online at wholesale pricing to Alex Jones listeners.
[03:07:54.021 --> 03:07:55.761]  Go to NoGerms.info.
[03:07:55.761 --> 03:07:57.982]  That's NoGerms.info.
[03:07:57.982 --> 03:07:59.703]  Be well and stay well.
[03:07:59.703 --> 03:08:01.843]  Best MZ.
[03:08:01.843 --> 03:08:04.624]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[03:08:04.624 --> 03:08:07.405]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:08:17.478 --> 03:08:23.061]  We are continuing with your phone calls today as promised for Pastor Lindsey Williams.
[03:08:23.061 --> 03:08:25.182]  Saeed in Canada.
[03:08:25.182 --> 03:08:27.283]  You're on the air with Lindsey Williams.
[03:08:27.283 --> 03:08:29.264]  Go ahead.
[03:08:29.264 --> 03:08:30.144]  Hi Lindsey.
[03:08:30.144 --> 03:08:31.365]  Hi Alex.
[03:08:31.365 --> 03:08:33.246]  I congratulate both of you.
[03:08:33.246 --> 03:08:38.008]  I always pray for your health, wealth, and your family's safety.
[03:08:38.008 --> 03:08:39.829]  And I really stand behind you.
[03:08:39.829 --> 03:08:45.892]  I'm a Muslim and I'd like to comment on your... I have a question basically for Lindsey.
[03:08:46.596 --> 03:08:59.406]  Lindsay, you're a pastor, you're a practicing Christian, and I, being a Muslim, ask you, you were mentioned about the devil's messiah lately when you spoke to the elitist.
[03:08:59.406 --> 03:09:05.651]  And in Christianity, the Bible also talks about it, informs us about it.
[03:09:05.651 --> 03:09:13.657]  Islam, the last prophet of God, Allah, the Almighty, also told us, Muhammad, peace be upon him, and Jesus, peace be upon him as well.
[03:09:14.856 --> 03:09:31.465]  They both told us about this messiah, or a false messiah, or devil, or a devil's messiah, or the Antichrist, or as in the revelations, in Islamic revelations, he's called Dajjal.
[03:09:31.465 --> 03:09:40.369]  And why don't we do something to reconcile the Judaic prophecies, the Christian prophecies, the Islamic prophecies,
[03:09:40.985 --> 03:09:50.893]  And what we know about scientifically and on ground what they're doing to prepare for that Antichrist that we know is going to come, and he's going to take advantage of this system.
[03:09:50.893 --> 03:09:59.899]  They have completed the One World Government, and I believe that he will just come out and take control of the One World Government and say, thank you very much, give me the control.
[03:09:59.899 --> 03:10:07.005]  Okay, listen, I appreciate your call, specifically the One World Government, even if you don't believe in God.
[03:10:07.850 --> 03:10:09.772]  The world government believes they are God.
[03:10:09.772 --> 03:10:12.053]  They're playing God.
[03:10:12.053 --> 03:10:15.356]  And they want to manifest this world system.
[03:10:15.356 --> 03:10:16.877]  You have worked with the elite.
[03:10:16.877 --> 03:10:18.578]  I've read their own documents, their own statements.
[03:10:18.578 --> 03:10:21.681]  They're all obsessed with the occult.
[03:10:21.681 --> 03:10:25.483]  They pray to a God, but it's not the God everybody thinks they're praying to.
[03:10:25.483 --> 03:10:26.885]  Lindsey Williams.
[03:10:26.885 --> 03:10:32.289]  Yeah, when George Bush used the expression, our former president, he said, God bless you.
[03:10:32.289 --> 03:10:33.670]  What God was he talking about?
[03:10:33.670 --> 03:10:36.652]  No, he was not talking about the creator of all heaven and earth.
[03:10:37.182 --> 03:10:40.864]  The one who sent his son to die for us on the cross and purchase our salvation.
[03:10:40.864 --> 03:10:46.787]  And when this elite talked with me just a few days ago, he was not talking about the Antichrist.
[03:10:46.787 --> 03:11:00.013]  When he mentioned the Devil's Messiah, he was talking about a system, a spirit of deception, which they have used over the years to subvert our schools, to bring in evolution, to fool the pastors,
[03:11:00.623 --> 03:11:07.926]  and to change our republic to a democracy and he went into these individuals as to how they have used this system to do that.
[03:11:07.926 --> 03:11:14.990]  He was not dealing with the Antichrist, the person or being that some religious groups are looking forward to.
[03:11:14.990 --> 03:11:19.192]  We dealt with the subject of the system.
[03:11:19.192 --> 03:11:20.332]  Let's go to another call.
[03:11:20.332 --> 03:11:21.413]  Eric in Wisconsin.
[03:11:21.413 --> 03:11:22.653]  You're on the air with Lindsey Williams.
[03:11:22.653 --> 03:11:23.073]  Go ahead.
[03:11:23.073 --> 03:11:26.215]  Hey, how you doing Alex?
[03:11:26.215 --> 03:11:26.655]  Good, go ahead.
[03:11:26.655 --> 03:11:27.996]  I have a couple questions actually.
[03:11:29.557 --> 03:11:31.057]  I have a couple questions.
[03:11:31.057 --> 03:11:35.638]  First off, for Lindsey, I have a couple questions.
[03:11:35.638 --> 03:11:40.519]  The person who brought me to Christ, I've been talking to him for several weeks now, trying to explain the New World Order to him.
[03:11:40.519 --> 03:11:41.679]  He doesn't want to hear it.
[03:11:41.679 --> 03:11:44.079]  He's a totally God-fearing person.
[03:11:44.079 --> 03:11:44.840]  He believes in Jesus.
[03:11:44.840 --> 03:11:47.180]  I mean, he's a wonderful person.
[03:11:47.180 --> 03:11:51.621]  What would, in Lindsey's opinion, be the best way to wake up Christians?
[03:11:51.621 --> 03:11:56.041]  And what would be his response to Romans 13?
[03:11:56.041 --> 03:11:57.762]  My goodness, I wish I could wake him up.
[03:11:57.762 --> 03:11:58.802]  I've been trying for
[03:11:59.363 --> 03:12:09.927]  I've been trying for 40 years to wake my pastor friends up, but they're so bound in thinking that the only thing they can do is what they're presently doing.
[03:12:09.927 --> 03:12:15.409]  And, of course, you have to understand that most of them are very happy with the paycheck they're getting.
[03:12:15.409 --> 03:12:18.310]  I think if they lost it, they'd probably be a lot better off.
[03:12:18.310 --> 03:12:20.851]  But I don't know how to wake them up.
[03:12:20.851 --> 03:12:28.074]  I wish I could, and I hope that Alex's DVD and the new one I've made, I hope it'll wake up a lot of pastors.
[03:12:30.539 --> 03:12:30.939]  I agree.
[03:12:30.939 --> 03:12:42.367]  I just watched a follow-up book the other day, and I'm familiar with Oath Keepers and We Are Change, and I think that people need to figure out where they fit in and get in.
[03:12:42.367 --> 03:12:56.216]  If you've ever pledged allegiance to any social position, I would be a member of Oath Keepers, as well as, if you're not, even if you're a college student or whatever, I'd get involved with We Are Change.
[03:12:56.216 --> 03:12:59.018]  And also, even a message to the elites,
[03:12:59.700 --> 03:13:01.341]  Are the people even involved with the elites?
[03:13:01.341 --> 03:13:04.363]  You know, these are people that are telling you to lie constantly.
[03:13:04.363 --> 03:13:07.945]  At what point do you think that these people are not lying to you?
[03:13:07.945 --> 03:13:09.546]  All right, I appreciate it.
[03:13:09.546 --> 03:13:10.327]  Go ahead, Lindsey.
[03:13:10.327 --> 03:13:26.277]  Yeah, the reason I know they're not lying to me is because for the past 35 years, they have not told me, these two individuals, and I've been in a number of individuals I'm in touch with, and these two individuals never, in the past 35 years, have ever told me anything that didn't happen.
[03:13:26.713 --> 03:13:34.682]  So, therefore, I think what they're saying today to be true, especially when you're 85 years of age and pacing the graveyard and you nearly died last winter.
[03:13:34.682 --> 03:13:38.887]  So, give this man credit for the fact that he's probably confessing everything.
[03:13:38.887 --> 03:13:39.568]  Absolutely.
[03:13:39.568 --> 03:13:41.430]  Let's go ahead and make another call.
[03:13:41.430 --> 03:13:42.571]  Robert in Colorado.
[03:13:42.571 --> 03:13:43.713]  You're on the air with Lindsey Williams.
[03:13:45.013 --> 03:13:47.115]  It's great talking to both of you guys.
[03:13:47.115 --> 03:13:49.057]  I've got a quick little point before I get to my main point.
[03:13:49.057 --> 03:13:53.001]  You were talking about all the propaganda that's pushing cap and trade.
[03:13:53.001 --> 03:13:56.805]  When I was at the gas station the other day, I actually saw something that was pretty interesting.
[03:13:56.805 --> 03:13:59.047]  It was actually against it.
[03:13:59.047 --> 03:14:03.251]  It was the gas station telling you how much more your gas prices will go up.
[03:14:03.871 --> 03:14:13.677]  I was in a locally owned Austin gas station and they had a little red flyer against cap-and-trade and I said, did the Dutch Royal Shell give this to you?
[03:14:13.677 --> 03:14:15.738]  And they said, no, the owner did.
[03:14:17.832 --> 03:14:22.636]  I mean, I think that's really great for businesses who are really kind of trying to inform people about what's happening.
[03:14:22.636 --> 03:14:24.977]  It's kind of when, uh, cigarette taxes, kind of same thing.
[03:14:24.977 --> 03:14:33.163]  But my main point is, is that, uh, you know, as I've been listening to the show, I've been getting more and more, you know, trying to organize, um, a small group of people in my local city.
[03:14:33.163 --> 03:14:36.405]  We, um, it's called, uh, Humans Against Insanity.
[03:14:36.405 --> 03:14:40.969]  And we've got blogs and we're trying to do, uh, trying to do little stuff on our school.
[03:14:40.969 --> 03:14:46.953]  But I ended up designing a poster for against the, uh, uh, educating people for against the vaccines.
[03:14:56.458 --> 03:15:03.724]  That's right.
[03:15:03.724 --> 03:15:06.166]  How do you know something is effective?
[03:15:06.166 --> 03:15:10.509]  You know it's effective if the establishment doesn't want it up, but I'm going to let you go.
[03:15:10.509 --> 03:15:11.250]  Here's the deal.
[03:15:11.250 --> 03:15:18.455]  I went to the first five or six callers that were on the board, but now the callers need to be specifically for questions for Lindsey Williams.
[03:15:18.455 --> 03:15:19.276]  I got him until 40 after, and
[03:15:22.034 --> 03:15:24.876]  If you missed what he covered in the last three shows, it's on his DVD.
[03:15:24.876 --> 03:15:31.001]  We'll tell you how to get that before he leaves us, but bottom line, these are calls for Lindsey Williams now.
[03:15:31.001 --> 03:15:31.901]  1-800-259-9231.
[03:15:31.901 --> 03:15:36.024]  But great, great job, Robert.
[03:15:36.024 --> 03:15:36.465]  Keep it up.
[03:15:36.465 --> 03:15:38.326]  Call me back on another day and tell me about it.
[03:15:38.326 --> 03:15:39.907]  Dan in Wisconsin, you're on the air.
[03:15:39.907 --> 03:15:41.408]  Go ahead.
[03:15:41.408 --> 03:15:44.591]  Yeah, hi Alex and Lindsey, thanks for what you're doing.
[03:15:44.591 --> 03:15:49.935]  Right to the point, Lindsey, as a chaplain, you probably know full well that in the Book of Revelations it says that
[03:15:51.305 --> 03:15:54.006]  There is going to come about a global dictator.
[03:15:54.006 --> 03:16:01.548]  And I'm wondering, even though we're supposed to be fighting evil and I do fight these guys every day the best I can, what can we do to actually stop all this?
[03:16:01.548 --> 03:16:04.269]  Because God said in the Bible that it is going to happen.
[03:16:04.269 --> 03:16:08.570]  There is going to come about a global government and a global dictator.
[03:16:08.570 --> 03:16:13.172]  And since that's already written... I want to comment and then get Lindsey's take.
[03:16:13.172 --> 03:16:13.352]  Look.
[03:16:15.336 --> 03:16:18.038]  The government loves the doctrine in the churches of Romans 13.
[03:16:18.038 --> 03:16:20.861]  The founding fathers were bad.
[03:16:20.861 --> 03:16:23.163]  Lay down to your King George III.
[03:16:23.163 --> 03:16:25.325]  He is bestowed upon us by God.
[03:16:25.325 --> 03:16:26.345]  It's a total distortion.
[03:16:26.345 --> 03:16:29.508]  I've had pastor after pastor after pastor on the radio.
[03:16:29.508 --> 03:16:34.953]  Almost all the prophets, Jesus, you name it, were killed by the government.
[03:16:36.147 --> 03:16:41.609]  Because they didn't follow orders and because, I mean, the Pharisees were the religious leaders.
[03:16:41.609 --> 03:16:48.811]  Christ went in and whipped them with a whip and overturned their tables with the money changers.
[03:16:48.811 --> 03:16:54.053]  Now, what we have here is, let's say it's the end of the world five years from now.
[03:16:54.053 --> 03:16:55.834]  I don't believe that, but whatever.
[03:16:55.834 --> 03:16:58.155]  Let's say all this is going to happen now.
[03:16:58.155 --> 03:17:04.777]  It's my job to let people know this is the world government system so they can warn others that it's bad to not be part of it.
[03:17:05.811 --> 03:17:08.213]  Total misinterpretation of that scripture that you're talking about in Romans.
[03:17:08.213 --> 03:17:10.916]  Pastors take it and twist it to mean exactly what they think it means.
[03:17:29.160 --> 03:17:31.561]  Oh my goodness, quick, let me give you this.
[03:17:31.561 --> 03:17:33.582]  Lend unto Caesar that which is Caesar's.
[03:17:33.582 --> 03:17:34.823]  Caesar was a dictator.
[03:17:34.823 --> 03:17:37.845]  We don't have a king in the United States of America.
[03:17:37.845 --> 03:17:40.566]  Who is Caesar in the United States of America?
[03:17:40.566 --> 03:17:42.527]  Come on folks, wake up!
[03:17:42.527 --> 03:17:48.750]  I beg of you pastors, the first three words of the Constitution, we the people.
[03:17:48.750 --> 03:17:55.514]  We are a constitutional republic, and in a constitutional republic you don't lend anything unto a king.
[03:17:56.027 --> 03:18:01.990]  The people are the... They're the ruling force of the United States of America.
[03:18:01.990 --> 03:18:09.573]  Quit preaching this business of trying to be obedient to a bunch of godless presidents and congressmen.
[03:18:09.573 --> 03:18:11.514]  That is not what the scriptures say at all.
[03:18:11.514 --> 03:18:21.958]  Well, Pastor, going back to Christ and to Paul, and you're the expert on this, so... And regardless of people believing God or not, this is what's governing our systems, so we should talk about it.
[03:18:21.958 --> 03:18:23.599]  But they were trying to set Christ up.
[03:18:24.653 --> 03:18:31.996]  They were trying to set Paul up, saying, should we pay taxes, knowing he'd be killed if he said no.
[03:18:31.996 --> 03:18:36.858]  And he said, look, the things that are God's are God's, the things that are Caesar, whose face on that?
[03:18:36.858 --> 03:18:38.339]  It's Caesar, it's his system.
[03:18:39.221 --> 03:18:43.703]  But, God also says, keep the commandments, don't be part of evil.
[03:18:43.703 --> 03:18:49.667]  Why were the Christians killed in Rome in the first 300 years A.D., or Common Era?
[03:18:49.667 --> 03:18:52.908]  Because they were saying no to following what Caesar said.
[03:18:52.908 --> 03:18:58.652]  These churches are so devilish on their face, Pastor Williams.
[03:18:58.652 --> 03:19:02.474]  Bible 1 C 3 is a noose around your neck.
[03:19:02.474 --> 03:19:06.856]  Separation of church and state is never in the Constitution of the United States of America.
[03:19:06.856 --> 03:19:08.537]  It's buzzwords they've put in your mind.
[03:19:08.948 --> 03:19:14.592]  Listen to Thomas Jefferson and be realistic, folks, and take the Bible for what it says.
[03:19:14.592 --> 03:19:21.597]  Thomas Jefferson, one of the founders of this nation, said, Rebellion to tyrants is obedience to God.
[03:19:21.597 --> 03:19:26.340]  Oh my goodness, preachers, I wish I could preach it in your pulpit every Sunday.
[03:19:26.340 --> 03:19:34.686]  The truth of a constitutional republic and the United States of America for what it is and what the Bible really says
[03:19:37.398 --> 03:19:40.419]  I don't know Alex.
[03:19:40.419 --> 03:19:43.600]  Rebellion against tyrants is obedience to God.
[03:19:43.600 --> 03:19:47.822]  And that's what the whole of the Bible says.
[03:19:47.822 --> 03:19:49.883]  But, I mean, look at Moses.
[03:19:49.883 --> 03:19:54.664]  He should have hit his knees to Ramses and said, Hail Ramses the Great.
[03:19:54.664 --> 03:19:55.565]  But no.
[03:19:55.565 --> 03:19:58.986]  So according to these preachers, Moses is of the devil.
[03:20:03.317 --> 03:20:05.339]  Remain in your houses.
[03:20:05.339 --> 03:20:11.104]  The President of the United States has declared martial law under Executive Order 11004.
[03:20:11.104 --> 03:20:12.466]  Will they do it?
[03:20:12.466 --> 03:20:15.068]  Will they pull the trigger this time?
[03:20:15.068 --> 03:20:21.014]  We all pray they stand down, but an engineered crisis seems more likely with each passing day.
[03:20:21.534 --> 03:20:23.715]  Think it can't happen here?
[03:20:23.715 --> 03:20:27.997]  Executive Order 10-990 locks down all highways.
[03:20:27.997 --> 03:20:32.880]  Executive Order 10-995 seizes control of all media outlets.
[03:20:32.880 --> 03:20:37.782]  Executive Order 10-998 controls all farms and food supplies.
[03:20:37.782 --> 03:20:42.605]  All these executive orders are now cocked, loaded, and waiting for the right crisis.
[03:20:43.525 --> 03:20:51.948]  So if you're worried about the possibility of martial law here in America, or have questions about how to survive it, go to MartialLawSurvival.com.

[03:21:01.704 --> 03:21:04.025]  Good day, Jim Newcomer from Midas Resources.
[03:21:04.025 --> 03:21:04.485]  October 27th, 2009.
[03:21:04.485 --> 03:21:05.485]  Gold opened this morning at $1037.90.
[03:21:05.485 --> 03:21:08.826]  A one ounce gold coin can be purchased for $1066.82, $533.41 for a half ounce, or $266.70 for the quarter ounce.
[03:21:08.826 --> 03:21:09.446]  That's $1066.82, $533.41, or $266.70.
[03:21:21.078 --> 03:21:31.563]  On June 4th, 1963, Executive Order 11110 was signed with the authority to strip the Federal Reserve Bank of its power to lend money to the United States government and interest.
[03:21:31.563 --> 03:21:34.764]  With the stroke of a pen, Kennedy would have put the Fed out of business.
[03:21:34.764 --> 03:21:38.166]  The November assassination quieted the production of the new currency.
[03:21:38.166 --> 03:21:40.927]  However, the Executive Order still stands unrepealed.
[03:21:41.147 --> 03:21:43.908]  Midas has the Kennedy vs. Fed document.
[03:21:43.908 --> 03:21:46.849]  Call 800-686-2237.
[03:21:46.849 --> 03:21:49.170]  Unlike your liberty, the paper is free.
[03:21:49.170 --> 03:21:52.051]  Call 800-686-2237.
[03:21:52.051 --> 03:21:55.773]  If you're interested in breaking the bondage of taxation and debt, call 800-686-2237.
[03:21:55.773 --> 03:21:55.953]  That's 800-686-2237.
[03:22:03.064 --> 03:22:07.112]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[03:22:07.112 --> 03:22:10.339]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[03:22:10.339 --> 03:22:11.761]  As we're finishing off this agenda...
[03:22:12.461 --> 03:22:15.142]  That we're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[03:22:15.142 --> 03:22:21.523]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[03:22:21.523 --> 03:22:26.704]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[03:22:26.704 --> 03:22:36.706]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[03:22:36.826 --> 03:22:39.167]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[03:22:39.167 --> 03:22:40.747]  They're asking for more matches!
[03:22:40.747 --> 03:22:43.207]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[03:22:43.207 --> 03:22:45.348]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[03:22:45.348 --> 03:22:50.489]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[03:22:50.489 --> 03:22:55.490]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com.

[03:23:57.782 --> 03:24:07.925]  Lindsey Williams is our guest.
[03:24:07.925 --> 03:24:11.366]  We're taking phone calls for him.
[03:24:11.366 --> 03:24:13.306]  Ruth in Louisiana, you're on the air.
[03:24:13.306 --> 03:24:14.887]  Welcome.
[03:24:14.887 --> 03:24:17.448]  Yes, Alex, you're awesome.
[03:24:17.448 --> 03:24:17.968]  You're awesome.
[03:24:17.968 --> 03:24:19.788]  Pastor Lindsey, you're awesome.
[03:24:19.788 --> 03:24:22.289]  Two-part question for Pastor Lindsey.
[03:24:23.292 --> 03:24:30.555]  Are they going to try to increase our interest rate on our mortgage to try to take our homes?
[03:24:30.555 --> 03:24:36.057]  Because if it goes so far, you know, we're not able to pay for it.
[03:24:36.057 --> 03:24:47.861]  Another question, if people that have gold and silver shares, bonds, or certificates, is that going to be safe or is that going to be worthless?
[03:24:47.861 --> 03:24:49.062]  Okay, appreciate your call.
[03:24:50.894 --> 03:24:52.976]  A piece of paper is worth what it's written on.
[03:24:52.976 --> 03:24:54.958]  It's nothing but a piece of paper.
[03:24:54.958 --> 03:24:59.021]  This gentleman did a few days ago, this silly, did talk with me about that.
[03:24:59.021 --> 03:25:00.042]  I'm so glad you asked.
[03:25:00.042 --> 03:25:03.565]  He said gold and silver are all you can depend on.
[03:25:03.565 --> 03:25:06.627]  He's talking about holding it in your hand.
[03:25:06.627 --> 03:25:12.032]  They know that nothing has any value except what is in their hand or their pocket.
[03:25:12.032 --> 03:25:14.774]  You need your own gold and silver in your hand.
[03:25:14.774 --> 03:25:17.937]  A piece of paper, again, let me stress, they do not trust it.
[03:25:18.410 --> 03:25:18.730]  Absolutely.
[03:25:18.730 --> 03:25:19.331]  That's a really good point.
[03:25:19.331 --> 03:25:20.712]  Let's continue and talk to Brad in Texas.
[03:25:20.712 --> 03:25:21.212]  Brad, you're on the air.
[03:25:21.212 --> 03:25:22.093]  Hello Alex and Lindsey.
[03:25:22.093 --> 03:25:23.094]  I have a quick question.
[03:25:23.094 --> 03:25:25.136]  You said that these people did have a religion.
[03:25:48.363 --> 03:25:57.450]  Um, what exactly religion is that and what is their code of ethics that you mentioned the other day?
[03:25:57.450 --> 03:25:59.651]  The elite positively have a code of ethics.
[03:25:59.651 --> 03:26:01.592]  They are not atheists.
[03:26:01.592 --> 03:26:03.153]  But, they worship a God.
[03:26:03.153 --> 03:26:06.376]  But not the same God which is the God of the Bible.
[03:26:06.376 --> 03:26:09.418]  The principle and power of this air is what they worship.
[03:26:09.418 --> 03:26:11.359]  They worship the God of this world.
[03:26:11.359 --> 03:26:16.803]  And when George Bush said, God bless you, he was talking about skull and bones God.
[03:26:17.290 --> 03:26:20.573]  He was not talking about the God who sent his son.
[03:26:20.573 --> 03:26:22.775]  And their rituals have now been videotaped.
[03:26:22.775 --> 03:26:23.796]  ABC News had it.
[03:26:23.796 --> 03:26:25.077]  It's Satan worship.
[03:26:25.077 --> 03:26:36.929]  They bow and pledge allegiance to the Prince of Darkness on the male side and to the goddess Eulogia on the other.
[03:26:36.929 --> 03:26:38.550]  Yes, this is true.
[03:26:38.550 --> 03:26:40.973]  They are Satanists.
[03:26:40.973 --> 03:26:41.413]  That's true.
[03:26:43.373 --> 03:26:46.336]  Let's go ahead and take another call.
[03:26:46.336 --> 03:26:48.698]  Let's talk to Trey in Connecticut.
[03:26:48.698 --> 03:26:51.120]  Trey, you're on the air.
[03:26:51.120 --> 03:26:51.560]  Hey, Alex.
[03:26:51.560 --> 03:26:52.061]  Hey, Lindsey.
[03:26:52.061 --> 03:26:53.562]  How are you guys doing today?
[03:26:53.562 --> 03:26:53.862]  Good.
[03:26:53.862 --> 03:26:55.444]  Speaking of skull and bones, there you are.
[03:26:55.444 --> 03:26:58.447]  Yeah, right next door.
[03:26:58.447 --> 03:27:01.189]  I'm just, you know, 45 minutes up the highway.
[03:27:01.189 --> 03:27:02.410]  From New Haven, Connecticut.
[03:27:02.410 --> 03:27:04.732]  Go ahead.
[03:27:04.732 --> 03:27:05.973]  No, New Haven, Connecticut.
[03:27:05.973 --> 03:27:07.655]  What's on your mind?
[03:27:07.655 --> 03:27:09.877]  I came across an article that ended up
[03:27:10.404 --> 03:27:16.711]  Yeah, I see a lot of that from the Disclosure Project run by the Rothschilds and others.
[03:27:22.011 --> 03:27:27.573]  We know there's a declassified program, part of it is declassified Bluebeam, to have staged alien landings.
[03:27:27.573 --> 03:27:29.933]  And I just cover what I can prove.
[03:27:29.933 --> 03:27:31.794]  We don't do the whole UFO thing.
[03:27:31.794 --> 03:27:34.915]  We don't dislike people that do.
[03:27:34.915 --> 03:27:42.677]  But the mainstream media tries to mix that in with the Federal Reserve being private or world government to discredit what we're doing.
[03:27:42.677 --> 03:27:46.998]  But Lindsey, you want to comment on Martians?
[03:27:46.998 --> 03:27:47.938]  Yes.
[03:27:47.938 --> 03:27:51.379]  For three months time, I didn't do a single radio talk show up until last week.
[03:27:51.946 --> 03:28:01.913]  And the reason I didn't is because I say it exactly like Alex just said, unless I know what I'm talking about, and I can prove it, I'm not going to say it.
[03:28:01.913 --> 03:28:17.104]  Now, when this man told me on the phone days ago what he did, I'm spreading it everywhere across this nation, from one side to the other, every radio show I can get on, everything I can possibly do, because I know it's going to happen just like he said it, because they have it planned.
[03:28:18.945 --> 03:28:20.665]  Alright, thank you so much, Trey.
[03:28:20.665 --> 03:28:25.026]  Joe in Connecticut, go ahead.
[03:28:25.026 --> 03:28:25.987]  He hung up.
[03:28:25.987 --> 03:28:27.327]  Let's go to Joe in Florida.
[03:28:27.327 --> 03:28:28.107]  Joe, go ahead.
[03:28:28.107 --> 03:28:30.868]  Okay, they're hanging up as we go to him here.
[03:28:30.868 --> 03:28:32.828]  I'm going to look at the call list then.
[03:28:32.828 --> 03:28:33.968]  Harry in Michigan.
[03:28:33.968 --> 03:28:34.928]  Harry, you're on the air.
[03:28:34.928 --> 03:28:36.709]  Oh, hi guys.
[03:28:36.709 --> 03:28:37.749]  How are you?
[03:28:37.749 --> 03:28:37.929]  Good.
[03:28:37.929 --> 03:28:39.189]  Hi, Harry.
[03:28:39.189 --> 03:28:41.050]  Uh, uh, Lindsey, I got a question.
[03:28:41.050 --> 03:28:44.470]  Uh, I'm, I'm, uh, a retired, uh, pipefitter.
[03:28:44.470 --> 03:28:46.831]  And, uh, I worked up on a, on a pipeline.
[03:28:47.617 --> 03:28:54.881]  And I know exactly what you're talking about with the cacto oil wells up there.
[03:28:54.881 --> 03:29:10.028]  And the people of the United States are just being taken as fools because we've got so much oil surplus up in Alaska and not to speak of what's down in the Gulf.
[03:29:10.028 --> 03:29:17.152]  And it's just a shame that America won't wake up and start casting pearls to swine
[03:29:18.825 --> 03:29:28.610]  I'm going to let you go sir.
[03:29:28.610 --> 03:29:32.473]  We're going to get a comment from Lindsey in our final segment with him.
[03:29:32.473 --> 03:29:34.794]  Straight ahead, we're going to continue with calls.
[03:29:34.794 --> 03:29:35.675]  We're going to talk to Pat.
[03:29:37.108 --> 03:29:39.390]  Matt, Pat, and others.
[03:29:39.390 --> 03:29:40.530]  1-800-259-9231.
[03:29:40.530 --> 03:29:44.953]  Final segment with Lindsey Williams.
[03:29:44.953 --> 03:29:47.875]  Then I've got a final news blitz coming up as well.
[03:29:47.875 --> 03:29:51.878]  Right here on the GCN Radio Network, I'm Alex Jones.
[03:29:51.878 --> 03:29:53.258]  We're on the march.
[03:29:53.258 --> 03:29:55.800]  The Empire's on the run.
[03:29:55.800 --> 03:29:58.482]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:00.939 --> 03:30:06.246]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[03:30:06.246 --> 03:30:10.772]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[03:30:10.772 --> 03:30:13.055]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[03:30:13.055 --> 03:30:14.677]  You don't have to cooperate.
[03:30:14.677 --> 03:30:15.719]  There is a solution.
[03:30:15.939 --> 03:30:24.365]  Inner Health Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.

[03:31:07.089 --> 03:31:10.330]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[03:31:10.330 --> 03:31:15.492]  As we're finishing off this agenda, we're pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home.
[03:31:15.492 --> 03:31:18.974]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress.
[03:31:19.614 --> 03:31:21.515]  And they really are calling the shots.
[03:31:21.515 --> 03:31:26.696]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us, as American citizens, to pay attention.
[03:31:26.696 --> 03:31:29.977]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation.
[03:31:29.977 --> 03:31:36.798]  The criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty, and on its ashes constructing world government.
[03:31:36.798 --> 03:31:39.159]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[03:31:39.159 --> 03:31:40.759]  They're asking for more matches!
[03:31:40.759 --> 03:31:43.200]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[03:31:43.200 --> 03:31:45.340]  Today, it seems like nobody does care.
[03:31:45.340 --> 03:31:48.061]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen
[03:31:48.842 --> 03:31:50.465]  A fall of the Republic.

[03:33:29.254 --> 03:33:31.116]  Final segment with Lindsey Williams.
[03:33:31.116 --> 03:33:33.398]  We'll let him go here in about 10 minutes.
[03:33:33.398 --> 03:33:37.382]  But let's continue with phone calls for our guests.
[03:33:37.382 --> 03:33:38.703]  I'm going to move rapid fire now.
[03:33:38.703 --> 03:33:40.605]  Please direct your question at Lindsey.
[03:33:40.605 --> 03:33:42.206]  We're going to jump to the next person.
[03:33:42.206 --> 03:33:43.828]  Pat in Oklahoma.
[03:33:43.828 --> 03:33:45.990]  You're on the air, Pat.
[03:33:45.990 --> 03:33:47.171]  Hi.
[03:33:47.171 --> 03:33:48.893]  My question is for Lindsey.
[03:33:52.000 --> 03:34:02.588]  I guess my question is, what is your comment, like, according to biblical prophecy, if we are in the last days, um, this one world government is going to have to come about?
[03:34:02.588 --> 03:34:09.654]  And do you think, um, maybe we're entering into a time of God's judgment on the nations?
[03:34:09.654 --> 03:34:13.497]  Well, definitely it's coming about, merely because it's biblical prophecy.
[03:34:13.497 --> 03:34:18.261]  Yet on the other hand, there may be some places that don't suffer it quite as much as others.
[03:34:18.261 --> 03:34:21.123]  And you'll have to understand that America has a biblical
[03:34:22.216 --> 03:34:30.979]  Constitutional, godly background, and I believe the Constitution is probably as close of a document as you'd find anywhere in the world to God-given.
[03:34:30.979 --> 03:34:39.061]  Now, the Word of God is the most God-given document on the face of this earth, but the Constitution definitely was inspired of the Lord.
[03:34:39.061 --> 03:34:44.762]  I would hope that America will not suffer as drastically as much of the rest of the world.
[03:34:44.762 --> 03:34:50.564]  I must admit outright that in my Bible study of 50 years, and I'm in my 70s,
[03:34:51.676 --> 03:34:56.577]  I cannot find America in the judgments.
[03:34:56.577 --> 03:34:58.078]  Now, you hear my words.
[03:34:58.078 --> 03:35:02.179]  I cannot find America in the judgments of the book of Revelation.
[03:35:02.179 --> 03:35:08.601]  Maybe we don't suffer as much as the rest of the world because maybe we'll see a repentance before that time.
[03:35:08.601 --> 03:35:11.042]  That's what I'm hoping for.
[03:35:11.042 --> 03:35:12.882]  Ma'am, I appreciate your call.
[03:35:12.882 --> 03:35:15.303]  Let's talk to Matt in California.
[03:35:15.303 --> 03:35:16.003]  Matt, go ahead.
[03:35:16.003 --> 03:35:17.964]  Hi, Pastor Lindsey.
[03:35:17.964 --> 03:35:18.904]  Hi, Alex.
[03:35:18.904 --> 03:35:19.064]  Hey.
[03:35:20.313 --> 03:35:27.219]  Hi, I'm a former Navy Submariner, and I'm now a seminary student, and I'd have a quick comment and a question for our guest.
[03:35:27.219 --> 03:35:30.382]  Just a question, or actually I'm going to go to the comment, about Genesis 3.15.
[03:35:30.382 --> 03:35:41.451]  I heard a caller calling in about it, and I just wanted to, I was sitting here doing my Hebrew studies, and I just wanted, people out there who are studying the Old Testament and the language, you can do a lot of damage if you don't know the languages fluently.
[03:35:41.451 --> 03:35:47.036]  And the passage is talking about what theologians call the Proto-Evangelium, and that's the first word of redemption.
[03:35:47.817 --> 03:35:55.919]  In a gospel germ form about Messiah Christ, that's what the seed is talking about in that passage, and that's how the original audience would have understood that passage.
[03:35:55.919 --> 03:36:03.080]  But, Pastor Lindsey, I have a question regarding the gentleman that's been giving you this information.
[03:36:03.080 --> 03:36:14.442]  I just was curious as to his theological disposition, whether he's atheist-agnostic, how many gods does he believe in, what does he believe about Jesus Christ, how to get saved.
[03:36:16.710 --> 03:36:29.774]  I am hoping, from the latest conversation that we've had, that probably the reason he's being honest with me and telling me many of these things is because I think something happened to him spiritually this past year.
[03:36:29.774 --> 03:36:36.896]  Now, I'm hoping to get much more in-depth into it, but I'm hoping for the best.
[03:36:36.896 --> 03:36:37.256]  Thank you.
[03:36:37.256 --> 03:36:39.837]  Alright, thank you so much.
[03:36:39.837 --> 03:36:42.338]  Good to hear from you.
[03:36:42.338 --> 03:36:43.218]  Who's up next here?
[03:36:45.472 --> 03:36:47.914]  Pat in Texas, you're on the air, go ahead.
[03:36:47.914 --> 03:36:49.595]  Hello.
[03:36:49.595 --> 03:36:55.119]  I have a, well, kind of a quick question for you both.
[03:36:55.119 --> 03:37:03.504]  I know everything is going on here and it's coming down to crunch time and all that, but is this happening all over the world too?
[03:37:03.504 --> 03:37:09.088]  Because I've never heard anybody mention that.
[03:37:09.088 --> 03:37:10.649]  That's pretty much my question.
[03:37:12.386 --> 03:37:13.747]  Yes.
[03:37:13.747 --> 03:37:21.730]  The financial crisis, the banking crisis, Iceland has declared bankruptcy, a number of other countries now on the verge of bankruptcy.
[03:37:21.730 --> 03:37:23.050]  Yes, this is worldwide.
[03:37:23.050 --> 03:37:28.973]  In fact, it is a new world order.
[03:37:28.973 --> 03:37:31.694]  And I think when you look in the scriptures, you'll find the same thing.
[03:37:31.694 --> 03:37:33.074]  It's global.
[03:37:33.074 --> 03:37:42.118]  But I'm hoping, and there again I express what I said to the prior caller, I am hoping that America is spared some of this because
[03:37:42.705 --> 03:37:50.652]  With our background, we will see a turnaround, godly, and we're finished.
[03:37:50.652 --> 03:37:51.933]  Okay.
[03:37:51.933 --> 03:37:53.594]  Does that answer your question?
[03:37:53.594 --> 03:37:55.936]  Yes, sir, it does.
[03:37:55.936 --> 03:37:56.877]  Thank you.
[03:37:56.877 --> 03:37:58.058]  Thank you so much.
[03:37:58.058 --> 03:37:59.679]  Let's talk to Mark in Texas.
[03:37:59.679 --> 03:38:00.440]  Mark, go ahead.
[03:38:00.440 --> 03:38:04.103]  Hey, good afternoon, Alex and Lindsay.
[03:38:04.103 --> 03:38:11.549]  This is great stuff everybody needs to be hearing about, and I'm glad to be on here and wanted to touch on a few things, if that's okay.
[03:38:11.934 --> 03:38:12.614]  Sure, go ahead.
[03:38:12.614 --> 03:38:14.975]  Do you have any questions for Lindsey?
[03:38:14.975 --> 03:38:16.196]  No, I just wanted to touch on it.
[03:38:16.196 --> 03:38:18.717]  Well, we're taking calls for Lindsey Williams.
[03:38:18.717 --> 03:38:19.357]  Yeah, definitely.
[03:38:19.357 --> 03:38:20.917]  I have a question for him, definitely.
[03:38:20.917 --> 03:38:23.018]  Then ask your question, please.
[03:38:23.018 --> 03:38:25.739]  Okay, well, it's more than a question.
[03:38:25.739 --> 03:38:37.464]  I just wanted to give a refresher of what I spoke with you once about, Alex, which was I mentioned this book that I got from research that has a Bible verse in it from Luke 12, 52, and it says that
[03:38:38.197 --> 03:38:44.742]  A lawyer says, whoa, and to them, you know, you hindered, you took away the knowledge from people you, you enter not in yourselves and you hinder those trying to enter in.
[03:38:44.742 --> 03:38:49.766]  And I, and I, you know, it was a guy that exposed the probate lawyer system.
[03:38:50.547 --> 03:39:01.930]  The probate lawyers, similar to all the things that these elites are doing, taking away, you know... Yeah, the probate lawyers most of the time go and sell you out, or... But that's another subject.
[03:39:01.930 --> 03:39:08.852]  Listen, I appreciate your call, but we don't have a lot of time left with Lindsey, and so we need questions addressed to Lindsey, not kind of pet projects.
[03:39:08.852 --> 03:39:12.713]  And I'm not trying to be mean to you, sir, but we normally have totally wide open phones.
[03:39:12.713 --> 03:39:14.194]  We don't screen your calls.
[03:39:14.194 --> 03:39:18.635]  And when I say that we need questions for Lindsey, and that's why he's here, that's what we're doing this for, okay?
[03:39:19.575 --> 03:39:23.316]  John in Texas, go ahead, you're on the air with Lindsey Williams.
[03:39:23.316 --> 03:39:25.136]  Lindsey, you keep talking about a timeline.
[03:39:25.136 --> 03:39:32.218]  I'd like to know where we are in the timeline right now and where and when the next part's going to take place.
[03:39:32.218 --> 03:39:33.998]  Yes, he did give me a timeline.
[03:39:33.998 --> 03:39:36.439]  I'll give you just a few of the expressions very quickly.
[03:39:36.439 --> 03:39:39.420]  Within two years, you will not recognize America.
[03:39:39.420 --> 03:39:44.501]  Again, he said, after two years, you will be so poor, you will not be able to rebel.
[03:39:44.966 --> 03:39:51.911]  He went on to say that nearly everyone will be working for the government, or the state, within two years.
[03:39:51.911 --> 03:39:59.037]  He kept repeating over and over and over their altered timeline of a two-year period, and they have some definite plans now.
[03:39:59.037 --> 03:40:02.600]  Whether they will succeed in accomplishing it or not is another story.
[03:40:02.600 --> 03:40:03.720]  I hope they don't.
[03:40:03.720 --> 03:40:05.842]  But on the other hand, that is their timeline.
[03:40:05.842 --> 03:40:08.444]  Okay.
[03:40:08.444 --> 03:40:11.306]  Well, what about the people who don't want to work for the government?
[03:40:11.306 --> 03:40:12.107]  What's going to happen to them?
[03:40:13.163 --> 03:40:22.271]  Well, there will be some mom-and-pop businesses that don't have mortgages that won't be taken over by all of this, but keep in mind there was one other thing he told me, too.
[03:40:22.271 --> 03:40:25.153]  He said war is planned after two years.
[03:40:25.153 --> 03:40:37.403]  Now, that is going to encompass so many new things that we never even thought of before, because when war comes in and the whole world eventually gets involved, you're talking a whole new ballgame here.
[03:40:37.403 --> 03:40:40.246]  And let me add, I appreciate your call, John.
[03:40:41.869 --> 03:40:47.433]  But they're announcing the feds are taking over the internet for our safety and may shut it off during emergencies.
[03:40:47.433 --> 03:40:49.835]  That's in my stack I'm about to cover.
[03:40:49.835 --> 03:40:53.677]  They're announcing the government's taking over every facet of our lives.
[03:40:53.677 --> 03:40:59.522]  And you may work for a big corporation, but it's going to rely on government contracts.
[03:40:59.522 --> 03:41:10.850]  Because the big Fortune 500, they want government contracts to control everything, because they control the government, and the government will only give them the contracts.
[03:41:11.829 --> 03:41:18.954]  It's these big corporations tying in with government and using that to perfect their tyranny.
[03:41:18.954 --> 03:41:22.257]  But by speaking out against this, we may be able to stop it.
[03:41:22.257 --> 03:41:23.878]  Let's jam in a few final calls.
[03:41:23.878 --> 03:41:25.159]  Virgil in Oklahoma.
[03:41:25.159 --> 03:41:27.721]  Virgil, you're on the air with Lindsey Williams.
[03:41:27.721 --> 03:41:29.542]  Alright, quick butt-kissing to you, Alex.
[03:41:29.542 --> 03:41:31.284]  Great job on the fall of the Republic.
[03:41:32.296 --> 03:41:36.240]  Um, Mr. Williams, can you elaborate on the Devil's Messiah?
[03:41:36.240 --> 03:41:40.404]  Or maybe point me to some research material where I can look this up further?
[03:41:40.404 --> 03:41:50.833]  Well, that's the term this elitist used for how they've taken over the churches and have the churches selling the people on tyranny, the clergy response teams, correct, Lindsey?
[03:41:50.833 --> 03:41:52.655]  Yeah, you won't find that on the internet.
[03:41:52.655 --> 03:41:56.838]  I mean, if I had not been talking with this individual, and if I had not known him for 35 years,
[03:41:58.027 --> 03:41:59.468]  All right, Virgil, thank you.
[03:41:59.468 --> 03:42:00.689]  Eric in California, go.
[03:42:00.689 --> 03:42:01.250]  That was explosive.
[03:42:01.250 --> 03:42:02.490]  Eric, go ahead, you're on the air.
[03:42:27.967 --> 03:42:30.127]  Yes, go ahead.
[03:42:30.127 --> 03:42:36.009]  The question for you, Lindsey, is that basically when you say the dollar is going to be dead, does that mean that necessarily it's going to zero?
[03:42:36.009 --> 03:42:41.090]  And if it's going to zero, what is going to happen to all the revolving lines of credit?
[03:42:41.090 --> 03:42:50.592]  Well, I don't believe that means they're going to slowly kill it and devalue it to monetize and pay off the fiat debt to themselves.
[03:42:50.592 --> 03:42:53.032]  Is that the intel you've got, Lindsey?
[03:42:53.032 --> 03:42:53.673]  That's correct.
[03:42:53.673 --> 03:42:55.733]  In fact, whenever you take a wheelbarrow load
[03:42:56.272 --> 03:43:00.196]  of dollars to the grocery store to buy a loaf of bread, you will know the dollar's dead.
[03:43:00.196 --> 03:43:05.560]  Okay, and that's gonna happen in two years?
[03:43:05.560 --> 03:43:10.024]  Uh, he said, he put it this way, I'll read, I'll give you his exact words.
[03:43:10.024 --> 03:43:17.271]  He said, uh, by 2012, within approximately two years, the dollar will be dead, and he used the word dead.
[03:43:17.271 --> 03:43:18.212]  Alright, thank you, Eric.
[03:43:18.212 --> 03:43:18.432]  Go ahead.
[03:43:20.834 --> 03:43:21.434]  That is correct.
[03:43:21.434 --> 03:43:23.816]  It will no longer be the reserve currency of the world.
[03:43:23.816 --> 03:43:25.577]  In fact, that was pretty much
[03:43:41.388 --> 03:43:43.209]  In fact, I've got a mainstream news article.
[03:43:43.209 --> 03:43:45.290]  Here's the New York Post, but it was all over the news two weeks ago.
[03:44:03.604 --> 03:44:07.946]  Dollar loses reserve status to yen and euro.
[03:44:07.946 --> 03:44:10.767]  Dollar loses reserve status to yen and euro.
[03:44:10.767 --> 03:44:16.989]  They've now gone more to buying euros and other currencies than they are the dollar.
[03:44:16.989 --> 03:44:18.570]  So it's already begun.
[03:44:18.570 --> 03:44:19.530]  Sometimes I read a headline.
[03:44:19.530 --> 03:44:20.291]  I can't seem to read it.
[03:44:20.291 --> 03:44:22.371]  I had one of those moments just now because I'm in a hurry.
[03:44:24.369 --> 03:44:28.654]  I'm going to give each caller 30 seconds, because I've got to go to a news blitz.
[03:44:28.654 --> 03:44:29.495]  I promise to do it.
[03:44:29.495 --> 03:44:36.803]  I'm disciplining myself here to take calls and cover news, and I'm trying to get better, because that's what I think is a better radio show.
[03:44:36.803 --> 03:44:41.388]  I could just settle into ranting for four hours, but I want to give people a more diverse view.
[03:44:41.388 --> 03:44:43.591]  Very quickly, Omar in Texas, go.
[03:44:44.744 --> 03:44:46.325]  Hey, how you doing there guys?
[03:44:46.325 --> 03:44:46.885]  Good, go ahead.
[03:44:46.885 --> 03:44:50.587]  I appreciate all the good work that you are doing.
[03:44:50.587 --> 03:44:52.828]  Hey, just a quick comment.
[03:44:52.828 --> 03:44:54.688]  The information, of course, is explosive.
[03:44:54.688 --> 03:44:55.869]  It's a blockbuster.
[03:44:55.869 --> 03:45:06.874]  But, Lindsey, you made a comment earlier about there's nowhere in the Bible concerning what's going to happen to America and all of this when everything comes crashing down.
[03:45:06.874 --> 03:45:14.377]  Basically, of course, there's nothing in the Bible that speaks of America's standing in these last days before the coming of our Savior.
[03:45:14.966 --> 03:45:28.518]  But I would just like to just, you know, I'm a member of the Mormon Church, and we get a lot of flack from other Christian faiths, but the Book of Mormon speaks specifically about what's going to happen to America.
[03:45:28.518 --> 03:45:33.943]  Okay, Omar, listen, if you don't have a question for Lindsey Williams, I appreciate your call.
[03:45:33.943 --> 03:45:36.966]  I'm not here debating different religions and different faiths with people.
[03:45:37.955 --> 03:45:39.016]  Okay.
[03:45:39.016 --> 03:45:43.999]  We're here talking about what Lindsey Williams was told by this individual.
[03:45:43.999 --> 03:45:46.520]  And last caller is Jen in Pennsylvania.
[03:45:46.520 --> 03:45:49.222]  Jen, you're on the air from Pennsylvania.
[03:45:49.222 --> 03:45:51.243]  Hi there.
[03:45:51.243 --> 03:45:53.364]  I just want to make a comment.
[03:45:53.364 --> 03:45:55.786]  First-time caller.
[03:45:55.786 --> 03:46:03.850]  But I had a revelation just the other day, and it may be on the table at some point in time.
[03:46:03.850 --> 03:46:04.491]  An epiphany.
[03:46:04.491 --> 03:46:04.831]  Go ahead.
[03:46:05.868 --> 03:46:09.711]  Yeah, something that, um, is the birthday of Christ.
[03:46:09.711 --> 03:46:16.375]  Um, September 11th, 03, was the birthday of Christ, BC.
[03:46:16.375 --> 03:46:23.400]  And, um, so, if that means anything as far as where we're at and why that particular day was chosen.
[03:46:23.400 --> 03:46:29.145]  Ma'am, ma'am, I mean, as close as we know with the calendars, AD is after death.
[03:46:29.145 --> 03:46:32.047]  So how would 03 be his birthday?
[03:46:32.047 --> 03:46:33.227]  BC.
[03:46:33.227 --> 03:46:33.868]  Oh, BC.
[03:46:33.868 --> 03:46:34.829]  I missed what you were saying.
[03:46:35.851 --> 03:46:38.272]  Yeah, it was September 11th.
[03:46:38.272 --> 03:46:42.074]  Wouldn't that be 33 B.C.?
[03:46:42.074 --> 03:46:46.916]  Um, from what I have seen in research.
[03:46:46.916 --> 03:46:50.597]  Do you have a question for Lindsay?
[03:46:50.597 --> 03:46:51.778]  I just wanted to make a comment.
[03:46:51.778 --> 03:46:55.239]  Ernest Martin's book, Star of Bethlehem, it just is significant.
[03:46:55.239 --> 03:46:59.121]  I thought today would be a good day to call, so basically if anybody wants to find
[03:46:59.622 --> 03:47:01.764]  The information, it's out there.
[03:47:01.764 --> 03:47:04.306]  Okay, thank you, and I'm not trying to be frustrated with you.
[03:47:04.306 --> 03:47:08.689]  It's that we have limited time, and I just wanted to get questions for Lindsey, but thank you so much.
[03:47:08.689 --> 03:47:10.971]  I appreciate your call.
[03:47:10.971 --> 03:47:19.939]  Lindsey, briefly, and I appreciate you coming on, you have a six DVD set, three of them are new, on this whole subject with your conversation a few weeks ago with this gentleman.
[03:47:19.939 --> 03:47:24.523]  Please give people quickly the toll-free number if they want to call and get that.
[03:47:24.523 --> 03:47:28.646]  When you call my new toll-free number, you will get an American operator.
[03:47:29.170 --> 03:47:33.193]  The number is 888-799-6111.
[03:47:33.193 --> 03:47:38.898]  We have seven operators standing by right now.
[03:47:38.898 --> 03:47:42.541]  And if you want to go to the web, go to prophecyclub.com.
[03:47:42.541 --> 03:47:46.565]  P-R-O-P-H-E-C-Y-C-L-U-B.com again.
[03:47:46.565 --> 03:47:48.767]  Toll-free number, new toll-free number, 888-799-6111.
[03:47:48.767 --> 03:47:49.787]  Six new DVDs and Alex,
[03:47:57.938 --> 03:48:01.801]  I want to say emphatically.
[03:48:01.801 --> 03:48:07.866]  The most startling information you will find anywhere on the face of this earth today is, number one, fall of the republic.
[03:48:07.866 --> 03:48:17.213]  The second most startling information I guarantee you'll ever hear is what this elite told me only days ago in my three new DVD series, the number is 888.
[03:48:21.782 --> 03:48:23.763]  Okay, Lindsey, we're out of time.
[03:48:23.763 --> 03:48:26.445]  We'll talk to you again soon, Lord Willen.
[03:48:26.445 --> 03:48:28.947]  Thank you so much for spending time with us.
[03:48:28.947 --> 03:48:30.408]  Thank you, Alex.
[03:48:30.408 --> 03:48:30.888]  Thank you.
[03:48:30.888 --> 03:48:32.409]  Take care.
[03:48:32.409 --> 03:48:34.850]  There goes Lindsey Williams, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:48:34.850 --> 03:48:38.052]  I have two sponsors, I want to thank, that made the last couple hours possible.
[03:48:38.052 --> 03:48:40.134]  We're going to come back in the final segment.
[03:48:40.134 --> 03:48:44.196]  I'm going to blitz through this stack of news.
[03:48:44.196 --> 03:48:45.817]  Just going through the headlines.
[03:48:45.817 --> 03:48:47.318]  That is coming up in the final segment.
[03:48:47.318 --> 03:48:48.039]  Stay with us for that.
[03:48:49.602 --> 03:48:54.744]  Before I end this segment, I want to tell you about two great sponsors we have.
[03:48:54.744 --> 03:48:56.564]  One of them is silverlungs.com.
[03:48:56.564 --> 03:48:59.465]  That's silverlungs.com.
[03:48:59.465 --> 03:49:11.028]  The Silver Lungs Generator Trademark is a highly cost-effective colloidal silver generator and lung delivery system that produces pure and endless colloidal silver and delivers the solution directly to the bloodstream.
[03:49:11.028 --> 03:49:16.330]  Check out their latest audio archive answering the most commonly asked questions at silverlungs.com.
[03:49:16.330 --> 03:49:18.791]  Now you can finally make sense out of what colloidal silver is.
[03:49:19.511 --> 03:49:21.032]  And how it works.
[03:49:21.032 --> 03:49:24.894]  Visit their link on PrisonPlanet.com or go to SilverLungs.com.
[03:49:24.894 --> 03:49:30.777]  That's SilverLungs, L-U-N-G-S dot com.
[03:49:30.777 --> 03:49:35.459]  Continuing with EcuadorCentral.com, like the South American country.
[03:49:36.678 --> 03:49:40.580]  It is your duty to know every option you have to protect you and your family.
[03:49:40.580 --> 03:49:48.384]  Whether you are looking for a rental property, a new start, or you just want to know your options, I urge you to go to EcuadorCentral.com.
[03:49:48.384 --> 03:49:49.904]  This website is great.
[03:49:49.904 --> 03:49:52.706]  It will give you all the information you want to know before you go.
[03:49:56.260 --> 03:49:59.784]  Go to EcuadorCentral.com and see what these folks are doing.
[03:49:59.784 --> 03:50:05.730]  Whether you are interested in real estate investment, travel, or just want to see pictures and videos, go to EcuadorCentral.com.
[03:50:05.730 --> 03:50:07.331]  That's the country, Ecuador.
[03:50:07.331 --> 03:50:09.954]  EcuadorCentral.com.
[03:50:09.954 --> 03:50:13.157]  Ladies and gentlemen, we want to thank those sponsors for making the show possible.
[03:50:13.157 --> 03:50:15.260]  I'm not going to do any plugs here in the final segment.
[03:50:15.260 --> 03:50:16.140]  I just want to say again,
[03:50:17.130 --> 03:50:30.118]  That yes, Fall of the Republic, even though there's thousands of versions, over a thousand versions on YouTube alone, one of the videos, it's all diluted by him being everywhere, was on the front page as the number one featured video today.
[03:50:30.118 --> 03:50:30.938]  I don't know if it still is.
[03:50:30.938 --> 03:50:33.700]  Let's go to YouTube and see if it is.
[03:50:33.700 --> 03:50:40.224]  I try to recoup making the $200,000 film, and let me tell you, being free on the web doesn't do that.
[03:50:40.224 --> 03:50:44.847]  So please buy the high quality DVD and other films like Endgame,
[03:50:46.255 --> 03:50:48.216]  And Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove.
[03:50:48.216 --> 03:50:54.580]  If you want to know the religion of the elite, all that at InfoWars.com, because that pays for what we're doing here.
[03:50:54.580 --> 03:50:58.803]  And PrisonPlanet.tv, it's in higher quality there than it is on YouTube, and easier to download.
[03:50:58.803 --> 03:51:01.365]  But yes, the film is free on YouTube right now.
[03:51:01.365 --> 03:51:02.626]  Get the link, get it out to everybody.
[03:51:04.830 --> 03:51:11.733]  If you're tired of paying too much for gas, diesel, or heating oil, Future Fuel Technologies has the answer you're looking for.
[03:51:11.733 --> 03:51:13.854]  It's called FFT Fuel Saver.
[03:51:13.854 --> 03:51:24.979]  FFT Fuel Saver is made using a patented formula that helps fuel burn cleaner, resulting in a 10-20% increase in fuel efficiency, and reduces emissions 30% or more.
[03:51:24.979 --> 03:51:28.541]  Each bottle of FFT Fuel Saver will save you money, increase your impact,
[03:51:30.162 --> 03:51:30.883]  We're good to go!
[03:52:05.509 --> 03:52:09.535]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[03:52:09.535 --> 03:52:12.779]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[03:52:12.779 --> 03:52:14.202]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[03:52:14.887 --> 03:52:17.910]  That we're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[03:52:17.910 --> 03:52:23.955]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[03:52:23.955 --> 03:52:29.140]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[03:52:29.140 --> 03:52:39.129]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[03:52:39.249 --> 03:52:41.591]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[03:52:41.591 --> 03:52:43.193]  They're asking for more matches!
[03:52:43.193 --> 03:52:45.635]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[03:52:45.635 --> 03:52:47.777]  Today, it seems like nobody does care.
[03:52:47.777 --> 03:52:52.922]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[03:52:52.922 --> 03:53:02.030]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:53:07.458 --> 03:53:10.681]  Times are tough, and many of us expect them to get worse.
[03:53:10.681 --> 03:53:13.863]  The warning signs have been everywhere for a very long time.
[03:53:13.863 --> 03:53:16.826]  Therefore, you have no excuse not to be prepared.
[03:53:16.826 --> 03:53:23.271]  If another Great Depression strikes America, how will you excuse your lack of preparation to your loved ones?
[03:53:23.271 --> 03:53:26.794]  There are numerous places you can buy freeze-dried food.
[03:53:26.794 --> 03:53:28.555]  Patriotfood.com is different.
[03:53:29.025 --> 03:53:33.308]  Because our dried food supplies are not sold in fancy tin cans.
[03:53:33.308 --> 03:53:40.412]  Our 25 varieties of bulk food are packaged in heavy-duty, food-grade plastic bags that will last 10 years.
[03:53:40.412 --> 03:53:43.174]  While our competition charges $3,000, we ship to you 135 pounds
[03:53:46.900 --> 03:53:47.880]  Alright, final segment.
[03:53:47.880 --> 03:53:49.141]  We're gonna move quick here.
[03:54:12.921 --> 03:54:17.922]  Ron Paul has some key articles that we have up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[03:54:17.922 --> 03:54:20.903]  Anything less than full disclosure is unacceptable.
[03:54:20.903 --> 03:54:35.326]  The Senate has entered Audit the Fed counterfeits that don't audit the private run-for-profit Federal Reserve and Ron Paul has an editorial about it.
[03:54:35.326 --> 03:54:37.487]  Anything less than full disclosure is unacceptable.
[03:54:38.848 --> 03:54:40.190]  Another Ron Paul report here.
[03:54:40.190 --> 03:54:45.256]  Ron Paul questions why Obama daughters haven't taken swine flu vaccine.
[03:54:45.256 --> 03:54:46.918]  And he makes the point that that's going on.
[03:54:46.918 --> 03:54:50.222]  It's a Paul Watson article with a video clip on that.
[03:54:50.222 --> 03:54:51.343]  That's right, they won't take it.
[03:54:51.343 --> 03:54:55.168]  The German government and the German army gets a clean flu vaccine.
[03:54:57.150 --> 03:54:57.911]  We're good to go.
[03:55:13.220 --> 03:55:16.402]  To dismantle and control, I would add, the financial industry.
[03:55:16.402 --> 03:55:17.782]  Capital Hill blew.
[03:55:17.782 --> 03:55:25.926]  That's what the new banker bailout does, is give them not unlimited money, they already got that in the last bill, but unlimited power to even manage your hot dog stand.
[03:55:25.926 --> 03:55:31.489]  And I first covered that reading the bill, but even Judge Napolitano's done reports documenting that's what it says.
[03:55:31.489 --> 03:55:36.692]  Circulation drops at US newspapers as readers turn to online news sources.
[03:55:36.692 --> 03:55:38.853]  There's the link to the Los Angeles Times.
[03:55:38.853 --> 03:55:41.054]  The newspapers are just completely imploding.
[03:55:41.474 --> 03:55:45.436]  Mainly because they're a bunch of propaganda and spin.
[03:55:45.436 --> 03:55:47.937]  Castro's sister worked for the CIA.
[03:55:47.937 --> 03:55:49.078]  The CIA now admits.
[03:55:49.078 --> 03:55:50.258]  So did Lee Harvey Oswald.
[03:55:50.258 --> 03:55:54.360]  That's recently been declassified, though they still have kept most of it classified.
[03:55:54.360 --> 03:55:59.903]  Of course, turns out that Benito Mussolini was British intelligence, MI5, and so was Adolf Hitler.
[03:55:59.903 --> 03:56:01.324]  London Guardian reporting on that.
[03:56:01.824 --> 03:56:04.990]  Fewer illegal migrants flown to Mexico.
[03:56:04.990 --> 03:56:12.244]  The Department of Homeland Security, the Arizona Republic reports, has massively cut back the number of illegal aliens they're arresting and deporting.
[03:56:13.274 --> 03:56:18.637]  That's right, the slave grids to keep the American people in, not new slaves out.
[03:56:18.637 --> 03:56:20.519]  They want more slaves.
[03:56:20.519 --> 03:56:27.663]  Obama's H1N1 national pandemic declaration could invoke FEMA response to pandemic, and that's now beginning.
[03:56:27.663 --> 03:56:31.566]  Helicopter crashes killing 14 Americans in Afghanistan.
[03:56:31.566 --> 03:56:35.408]  They're hiding a lot of deaths, claiming they're having daily helicopter crashes.
[03:56:35.408 --> 03:56:40.632]  Certainly some of those are true, but one of their favorite ways to hide the true death toll, especially when they're about to increase troops,
[03:56:41.392 --> 03:56:44.736]  Is by claiming it was all air accidents.
[03:56:44.736 --> 03:56:47.699]  Morale dips for American Marines in Afghanistan.
[03:56:47.699 --> 03:56:52.604]  And they're saying because the Marines won't want the war to continue and want more troops.
[03:56:52.604 --> 03:56:56.388]  Oh, if you support the troops, keep them in the meat grinder guarding the opium.
[03:56:56.388 --> 03:56:58.650]  No, if you support them, bring them home.
[03:56:58.650 --> 03:57:02.214]  Bosnia on the brink of new civil war, the London Telegraph reports.
[03:57:02.214 --> 03:57:03.155]  That's good for the globalists.
[03:57:04.400 --> 03:57:07.041]  Bo Diddle talks about the new world order on Fox News.
[03:57:07.041 --> 03:57:11.682]  Don Imus on Fox News Business shuts him down when Bo Diddle talks about world government.
[03:57:11.682 --> 03:57:13.503]  We've really woken up Bo.
[03:57:13.503 --> 03:57:15.984]  He's in Truth Rising talking about bombs in the buildings.
[03:57:15.984 --> 03:57:20.806]  What a turnaround for Bo Diddle, the famous New York detective.
[03:57:20.806 --> 03:57:21.846]  Tough guy.
[03:57:21.846 --> 03:57:26.207]  Swine flu scam reaches new heights with Obama's emergency declaration.
[03:57:26.207 --> 03:57:27.348]  Just covered that.
[03:57:27.348 --> 03:57:32.970]  Medicare fraud raises troubling questions about our government's ability to manage a medical bureaucracy.
[03:57:32.970 --> 03:57:33.450]  But you see,
[03:57:34.622 --> 03:57:35.983]  The government wants fraud.
[03:57:35.983 --> 03:57:44.867]  They want the programs to be overwhelmed so the government borrows more money from the banks that just make it up out of nowhere but get interest and real assets back.
[03:57:44.867 --> 03:57:50.891]  That's why they want the states bankrupt and the federal government bankrupt and always spin, spin, spin us into their control.
[03:57:50.891 --> 03:58:02.237]  The total police state of Afghanistan with the admitted puppet Mohammed Karzai staging the last election, Afghan police and kin-state type activity, open fire on demonstrators, killing a whole bunch of them.
[03:58:03.854 --> 03:58:06.895]  Podesta suggests legalizing pot and taxing it.
[03:58:06.895 --> 03:58:11.996]  Marijuana is not like heroin or cocaine that the government controls and launders and ships in.
[03:58:11.996 --> 03:58:22.939]  It can be grown everywhere and it's one of the few drugs that the government doesn't control and so they want to start taxing it just like Prozac, just like the lottery, just like prostitution in Nevada.
[03:58:22.939 --> 03:58:24.380]  They want their stinking cut of it.
[03:58:25.200 --> 03:58:27.342]  That is it for this radio transmission.
[03:58:27.342 --> 03:58:28.943]  Great job with the crew today.
[03:58:28.943 --> 03:58:31.406]  Hip hip hooray!
[03:58:31.406 --> 03:58:33.568]  Retransmission starts in 20 seconds.
[03:58:33.568 --> 03:58:34.188]  One place.
[03:58:34.188 --> 03:58:35.589]  Infowars.com.
[03:58:35.589 --> 03:58:37.932]  And the podcast should be back up for folks today.
[03:58:37.932 --> 03:58:38.932]  See you back live tomorrow.
[03:58:38.932 --> 03:58:43.537]  More powerful guests and info.

[03:58:51.141 --> 03:58:54.523]  Have you ever wanted to generate your own supply of electrical power?
[03:58:54.523 --> 03:58:58.146]  If so, this is going to be the most important message you will ever hear.
[03:58:58.146 --> 03:59:02.709]  Solar powered generators are now available from Solutions from Science in Thompson, Illinois.
[03:59:02.709 --> 03:59:08.313]  These emergency backup systems provide life-saving electrical power when you need it most, unlike gas generators.
[03:59:08.593 --> 03:59:13.356]  A solar generator runs quietly, emits no fumes, and produces electricity for free.
[03:59:13.356 --> 03:59:16.978]  It's like having an electric power plant running quietly in your own home.
[03:59:16.978 --> 03:59:21.800]  Run sump pumps, shortwave radios, computers, and even keep food from spoiling.
[03:59:21.800 --> 03:59:28.364]  Whether it's hurricanes, ice storms, brownouts, or blackouts, you'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again.
[03:59:28.364 --> 03:59:30.325]  When the power goes out, you'll be ready.
[03:59:30.805 --> 03:59:34.007]  With a solar-powered generator from Solutions from Science.
[03:59:34.007 --> 03:59:38.510]  Go to mysolarbackup.com and get off the grid today.
[03:59:38.510 --> 03:59:40.291]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
