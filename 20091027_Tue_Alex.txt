[08:16.320 --> 08:22.880]  okay here's the deal the head of the united nations has written a disgusting editorial
[08:22.880 --> 08:30.720]  admitting everything but putting a horrid spin on it titled we can do it it's a silly and mindless
[08:30.720 --> 08:39.920]  is the bob the builder yes we can slogan parroted by the obamanoids there's also a big gallant
[08:39.920 --> 08:45.440]  poll out showing the majority of americans consider themselves conservatives and a year and a half ago
[08:45.440 --> 08:50.640]  and everybody hated bush they considered themselves liberals so people just keep hoping the other party
[08:50.640 --> 08:58.000]  out of power will save them then they figure out very very quickly that that is not the case
[08:58.000 --> 09:03.600]  and then they jump into the arms of the other party but more and more people are waking up to
[09:03.600 --> 09:08.000]  the fact that both parties not just here but in other countries around the world all the major
[09:08.000 --> 09:12.720]  parties some countries that have parliaments and three or four big parties five or six big parties
[09:13.520 --> 09:18.080]  are totally controlled and people are beginning to identify the banking structure the actual power
[09:18.080 --> 09:24.960]  structure that controls the globe today and people are learning very very fast that they are eugenicist
[09:24.960 --> 09:30.240]  that they have a depopulation agenda so the good news is people are really starting to wake up thanks
[09:30.240 --> 09:38.560]  to you the listeners of this radio show we are a large part of the global resistance and we're in
[09:38.560 --> 09:44.960]  our embryonic stage right now but the good news is we are growing very very quickly and we have a
[09:44.960 --> 09:56.240]  massive responsibility i get frustrated i get angry a lot because at a very basic level in my
[09:56.240 --> 10:03.120]  psyche in my wiring to know we have a bunch of criminal tyrants in control to fully understand
[10:03.120 --> 10:10.960]  intellectually with the evidence that we have a criminal elite who are the most abusive and sickening
[10:10.960 --> 10:19.200]  and out of control evil that history has ever seen and to understand that their plan is now unfolding
[10:19.200 --> 10:30.720]  against free humanity is is is enraging and i burn with a passionate consuming overriding
[10:30.720 --> 10:36.720]  desire to expose these people and to meet them on the field of intellectual battle and to
[10:36.720 --> 10:44.960]  disassemble their lies and their tricks and their different forms of bamboozling chicanery
[10:45.760 --> 10:52.240]  that they use against the population and once people begin to question the power structure
[10:52.240 --> 10:57.840]  once people begin to not just take what the mainstream media and politicians present at face
[10:57.840 --> 11:02.640]  value once you get the people to just start looking and digging around and poking around
[11:02.640 --> 11:09.200]  and questioning on their own the victory though it may take a lot of time to come to
[11:09.920 --> 11:16.960]  its final fruition is assured the question is how bad will it get before this technological
[11:16.960 --> 11:20.800]  enslavement system is overthrown because the establishment in literally thousands of books
[11:20.800 --> 11:25.600]  and publications and white papers brags that they're fully aware of how humans are going to resist
[11:26.240 --> 11:30.800]  what they're doing they study their own species and they are a predator class feeding on
[11:30.800 --> 11:37.440]  their own species and they believe their final revolution their scientific dictatorship will
[11:37.440 --> 11:45.680]  allow them to perfect this technological enslavement system but the good news is no matter how slick
[11:45.680 --> 11:50.560]  and how fancy and how much balkanization and divide and conquer they use and no matter how
[11:50.560 --> 11:55.600]  much poison they put in the water incrementally raising the dose so that we don't notice everybody
[11:55.600 --> 12:02.480]  dropping dead around us no matter all the tricks they play and no matter how much they press down
[12:02.480 --> 12:09.280]  the accelerator of oppression it is going to come down the new world order is dead on arrival
[12:12.400 --> 12:18.320]  now we're going to take your phone calls i'm going to do a news blitz at about 35 or 40 after
[12:19.040 --> 12:22.080]  but we're going to continue to take phone calls throughout the broadcast today

[13:16.800 --> 13:21.520]  uh article from the new american a magazine published by american opinion publishing
[13:22.080 --> 13:29.120]  uh which turns out to be a subsidiary of the john birch society um and it says in that article
[13:29.120 --> 13:35.040]  that this year's h1n1 flu vaccine contains squalene however the kansas department of health
[13:35.040 --> 13:42.160]  and environment says that the vaccine does not contain squalene and uh i've been keeping up
[13:42.160 --> 13:48.960]  with you and all the articles here locally about the h1n1 and turns out that the public here
[13:49.440 --> 13:55.840]  said there's a poll on the newspaper for that step 43 percent of the people say yes they are
[13:55.840 --> 14:03.440]  going to be getting the vaccine they believe it is safe and effective only 28 percent say no if they
[14:04.080 --> 14:10.320]  don't trust the vaccine and it has not been tested adequately for safety i'll just give you an
[14:10.320 --> 14:17.120]  update on what was going on here um i will not be getting the vaccine myself uh so that's all i got
[14:17.120 --> 14:22.960]  for you alex all right christ thank you so much there are five different companies making the
[14:22.960 --> 14:32.000]  injectable h1n1 vaccine and one company making the live virus nasal which the inserted myths can
[14:32.000 --> 14:38.320]  breed the flu and spread the flu that's why they released that first to spread it it has mercury
[14:38.320 --> 14:42.960]  in it as the adjuvant mercury according to dr blaylock and other medical doctors we've had on
[14:42.960 --> 14:49.280]  here that are experts in this field have stated that mercury is an adjuvant as well not only a
[14:49.280 --> 14:56.960]  deadly heavy metal neurotoxin the european version some of the european versions do have
[14:56.960 --> 15:02.640]  squalene most of the u.s versions do not have squalene but they do have the cancer viruses
[15:02.640 --> 15:09.680]  the mercury and a bunch of other additives in them okay let's talk to alan in florida alan you're on
[15:09.680 --> 15:18.720]  the air yes i got a situation i don't know about it's unlawful searches by the uh hilsbrook county
[15:18.720 --> 15:23.760]  school district what do i mean by that when we get reports of the children who say they're going to
[15:23.760 --> 15:29.840]  bring a gun to school where she contact the parents and then i don't know how we get away with this
[15:29.840 --> 15:36.560]  but we actually go into the family's home and search the child's room looking for said firearm
[15:36.560 --> 15:41.920]  but there's no warrants nothing yeah that's a knock on talk that's a knock and talk and so they just
[15:41.920 --> 15:50.480]  kind of force their way in setting the common law precedent uh through custom that they come in your
[15:50.480 --> 15:56.800]  home without a warrant and they do it all over the place if a child writes an essay that says my dad's
[15:56.800 --> 16:01.040]  a captain in the marine corps this is a real case and he has an m16 because they ask you to write
[16:01.040 --> 16:05.440]  about your parents and they do it digitally and they store it and the feds get it that's also been
[16:05.440 --> 16:11.520]  the nose and then they use that and i've seen reports where high school students one guy was a
[16:11.520 --> 16:16.400]  straight a student no criminal record his parents were divorced he was living with his grandparents
[16:16.400 --> 16:22.080]  they read his essay his english teacher didn't think it was bad about zombies attacking a fictitious
[16:22.080 --> 16:30.640]  school and they came and arrested him and he was sent to prison juvenile prison for writing it and
[16:30.640 --> 16:35.040]  they said we don't care if it's fictitious you don't talk about shooting zombies at a school
[16:35.040 --> 16:41.680]  and the funny thing was in the sixth grade was it was sixth grade intermediate i wrote a story
[16:41.680 --> 16:54.240]  uh about the zombies attacking the school and in the article uh one of the young men who
[16:54.240 --> 17:01.920]  was in the same class with me name was quarry strange black guy good friend of mine we kind
[17:01.920 --> 17:08.720]  of wrote this different versions of him and i killing the zombies and so in america now i would
[17:08.720 --> 17:13.280]  have been arrested doesn't matter how many tv shows and video games are about killing zombies
[17:13.840 --> 17:18.720]  you do that now you get arrested or they catch a pocket knife in your car you get arrested
[17:18.720 --> 17:23.440]  or you bring plastic dixie knives forks and spoons to cut up a cake for an after school party for
[17:23.440 --> 17:27.360]  your teacher when you're a senior seeing articles without having repeatedly you get arrested for
[17:27.360 --> 17:31.600]  the plastic knife and it's all part of training everyone that they're a prisoner appreciate the
[17:31.600 --> 17:40.400]  call alan jason in georgia jason you're on the air yeah alex how are you doing good great listen
[17:40.400 --> 17:46.240]  just reporting in from south georgia want to let you know my wife's a pharmacist and their
[17:46.240 --> 17:52.960]  hospital's trying to force everybody to take the vaccine over obama says they don't try to force
[17:52.960 --> 17:59.280]  anybody even though they're forcing school kids to take it another point i wanted to get in i've
[17:59.280 --> 18:05.760]  been following text mars for quite a while um there's a youth group in town that sponsored a
[18:05.760 --> 18:12.720]  hardcore quote christian rock group to come in and two of the members are doing the al diablo
[18:12.720 --> 18:21.200]  side on their promo flyer well that's interesting um i mean when it's obvious and people are doing
[18:21.200 --> 18:26.080]  that a lot of them just do it because it means rebellion or having fun but yes christianity
[18:26.080 --> 18:31.520]  certainly has been infiltrated by a lot of that my only thing with the al diablo is when you show
[18:31.520 --> 18:37.920]  ut fans doing it they don't think they're worshiping the devil and you know people can slow down video
[18:38.880 --> 18:43.360]  of myself when i'm waving my arms around and sometimes because i've broken my hand so many
[18:43.360 --> 18:47.840]  times and the tendons are out of alignment i don't have any knuckles on my two middle fingers
[18:47.840 --> 18:52.720]  plus i cut one finger off they tend to curl back i've got arthritis in the hand people say oh look
[18:52.720 --> 18:58.160]  there's the elder you know the al diablo there but when politicians do it and the pope does it
[18:58.160 --> 19:03.360]  everybody else does it and puts their thumb on their two middle fingers it is extremely obvious
[19:03.360 --> 19:10.560]  what's going on and it's an occult sign obviously to the devil but you know people also go overboard
[19:10.560 --> 19:15.280]  and show ron paul getting out of a car and i have to know ron paul has a very bad arthritis so does
[19:15.280 --> 19:23.600]  his brother wane and uh so we have to be careful at the same time off of you know people slowing

[22:00.880 --> 22:04.800]  anderson listeners of the network are familiar with the federal reserve note and understand the
[22:04.800 --> 22:10.160]  risks of deficit spending therefore with catastrophic events it comes as no surprise that some banks
[22:10.160 --> 22:14.320]  have currently placed limits on the amount of cash depositors can remove from their accounts
[22:14.320 --> 22:18.880]  a fractional reserve system means only a small portion of your deposit is held in reserve for
[22:18.880 --> 22:23.840]  immediate withdrawal deficit spending will skyrocket through fdic if the government is forced to ensure
[22:23.840 --> 22:29.280]  deposits during a bank run followed by a depressed economy a current effort is underway by the fed
[22:29.280 --> 22:33.840]  along with other central banks to increase liquidity for depositors however an increase in
[22:33.840 --> 22:39.200]  money supply without equal expansion and productivity can cause inflation in order to achieve strength
[22:39.200 --> 22:44.720]  and stability i recommend a conservative portion of all investments to be calmly repositioned into
[22:44.720 --> 22:50.480]  gold and silver while paper investments currently have been driven by debt gold on its own has held

[24:16.480 --> 24:20.960]  the flu in many cases and allows you to spread the flu there's like the smallpox injection
[24:20.960 --> 24:25.920]  from 2000 and 2002 2003 they tried to make first responders take killed a bunch of people
[24:25.920 --> 24:30.000]  cause an autoimmune response in the heart if you had any type of buildup in your heart it would
[24:30.000 --> 24:36.320]  cause an autoimmune response and just like if you get stung by a wasp your throat will swell up
[24:36.320 --> 24:41.360]  and you could choke to death that's an autoimmune response that's an allergic response and it does
[24:41.360 --> 24:46.320]  that in your organs in your pancreas and we've got all the literature and it isn't stopping and
[24:46.320 --> 24:52.240]  everyone I know knows someone who went on antidepressants for a car wreck or losing their job
[24:52.240 --> 24:57.760]  who commit suicide everyone I know knows people who've committed suicide everyone I know knows
[24:57.760 --> 25:03.280]  25 30 year old men and women who are in great shape don't use drugs who are dying or have died of
[25:03.280 --> 25:09.200]  cancer and they know they knew in 1981 when Donald Rumsfeld headed the company he got
[25:09.200 --> 25:16.000]  aspartame approved he sold nuclear reactors in North Korea to Pakistan anything evil he gets
[25:16.000 --> 25:21.840]  it approved when he got serotonin reuptake inhibitors approved with the first one Eli Lilly's
[25:21.840 --> 25:29.840]  prozac they knew it made large numbers commit suicide or become violent and almost every
[25:29.840 --> 25:33.600]  military person who's on this stuff who works at the post office well when you're in the military
[25:33.600 --> 25:38.480]  they pretty much automatically give you a job at the post office and that's why and almost
[25:38.480 --> 25:44.400]  all these people that go in and shoot everybody were on it and and just to sit here and to know
[25:44.400 --> 25:48.400]  that they know it's going to make kids shoot people at school they know it's going to make
[25:48.400 --> 25:53.440]  people commit suicide then they give the kids death education about don't commit suicide
[25:53.440 --> 25:57.600]  and they show them ways to commit suicide and then suicide numbers explode and then they put
[25:57.600 --> 26:01.760]  even more kids on the drugs and they bring psychologists into the schools to interview
[26:01.760 --> 26:07.680]  everybody and put the idea in their head they know what they're doing it's it's a pure evil system
[26:07.680 --> 26:12.400]  where they reap evil and they sow greater evil and they reap even more evil and then so greater
[26:12.400 --> 26:18.960]  evil and they feed off the evil they institutionalize it the crises that the corruption and and and
[26:18.960 --> 26:25.920]  death and murder and disease and poisoning creates they then set up systems to counter
[26:25.920 --> 26:29.280]  what they themselves have created just like the government's been caught in the federal
[26:29.280 --> 26:35.520]  reserve has been caught many many times shipping in cocaine heroin laundering the drug proceeds
[26:35.520 --> 26:41.520]  using it for black ops the 1996 solicitor general inspector general of the cia confirmed

[37:17.200 --> 37:26.160]  democrats that hated the war code pink and all these huge george soros publications
[37:28.320 --> 37:32.720]  and all the big democratic organizations are all announcing how great the wars are now
[37:33.280 --> 37:38.000]  and suddenly you don't see any peace rallies or if there are small ones the police just show up
[37:38.000 --> 37:42.720]  and hit you with l rad cannons and literally chase down women with billy clubs beating their heads
[37:42.720 --> 37:47.680]  in with blood spewing in all directions and police dogs old women walk out no one's allowed
[37:47.680 --> 37:53.600]  over a million people in pittsburgh women walk out front businesses and police dogs run up and
[37:53.600 --> 37:57.920]  the women say we're just shopping and the police scream get off the street and start biting them
[37:57.920 --> 38:08.080]  with dogs i mean that's worse than hitler we're already so far down the rat hole it makes my
[38:08.080 --> 38:12.320]  head spin and then some of the people in the office heard me talking about how everybody knows
[38:13.200 --> 38:18.240]  someone who's committed suicide on prozac or prozac type serotonin reuptake inhibitor drug
[38:18.240 --> 38:25.600]  and how nuts it makes people that are on it how nuts it makes them and how they knew that day one
[38:25.600 --> 38:31.280]  and then the other producer slash director slash boardop walking and said oh yeah to buddy
[38:32.000 --> 38:36.240]  they put him on that stuff and he blew his head off two days before my son was born
[38:37.840 --> 38:42.800]  i mean it's just everywhere the scourge of government and psychiatry and and then and
[38:44.320 --> 38:48.480]  if i could just get austin and travis county to admit they're going to dump sewage
[38:48.480 --> 38:52.560]  in the lake we could stop it but you know what they're just going to deny they're doing it until
[38:52.560 --> 38:58.960]  it's too late i mean that's how everything works around here and so now a lake that looked like
[38:58.960 --> 39:04.640]  the caribbean 30 years ago is a toy is going to be a toilet it's already screwed up all
[39:04.640 --> 39:08.720]  the stuff they dump in it and they just don't care and this is supposedly the environmentalist
[39:08.720 --> 39:13.600]  capital they're not environmentalists they want to steal your property all the big state senators
[39:13.600 --> 39:19.120]  and former mayors and all the rest of them that stole over 15 000 acres under s os save our springs
[39:19.120 --> 39:23.920]  the minute they stole all these farmers and ranchers land gave them in some cases one penny on the
[39:23.920 --> 39:29.200]  dollar in some cases 10 cents on the dollar they built hotels and luxury homes all over it now they're
[39:29.200 --> 39:34.320]  dumping sewer water in the lake and it's just all funny to them it's all a big joke
[39:40.320 --> 39:43.280]  they're all a bunch of crooks and they think it's funny
[39:43.280 --> 39:49.440]  and you know what the public's going to do they're going to go out there and jet ski and fish and
[39:49.440 --> 39:55.280]  just wait around in the feces and and and and just talk in the stink of the sewage and oh i love it
[39:55.280 --> 39:59.600]  there's no sewage in here alex is a liar just like the government and the media and the cult just
[39:59.600 --> 40:05.760]  like harden montana admitted 14 time felons 17 aliases hiring all these other felons coming in
[40:05.760 --> 40:10.800]  with police cars marked up with private security firm trying to police people in the city council
[40:10.800 --> 40:13.920]  announcing he was going to be the new police chief and then when it came out he was a felon
[40:13.920 --> 40:17.920]  and a con artist they all said in the newspaper we don't care we like him and we're just going to
[40:17.920 --> 40:23.840]  give him some more property to take over the town when we like the detention center people want to
[40:23.840 --> 40:28.320]  get hurt and you know why because once you've given yourself over to evil and corruption you start
[40:28.320 --> 40:35.920]  liking it you start thinking sewage water is good and clean you start thinking 51 million abortions
[40:35.920 --> 40:41.280]  they've had since 1973 with roe v wade you start thinking it's a wonderful good thing and it's
[40:41.280 --> 40:46.400]  not a human being so why not just euthanize old people why not deny people health care
[40:48.640 --> 40:55.280]  we are an evil sickening degenerate scum filled society and we had better come to grips with that
[40:55.280 --> 40:59.200]  and understand that when you become corrupt and people stop caring about each other and people
[40:59.200 --> 41:05.280]  stop being involved and people get dumbed down that bad things happen that corrupt governments
[41:05.280 --> 41:11.840]  take you over tax you to launch huge wars ship your sons off to die in them and now your daughters
[41:13.200 --> 41:18.720]  we are a conquered sewage pit
[41:21.120 --> 41:25.200]  and the globalists are all stealing everything that's even nailed down and leaving the country
[41:25.200 --> 41:26.560]  they've been leaving for three years
[41:26.560 --> 41:36.480]  to know that the mainstream media comes right out after decades of denying it and just calmly
[41:36.480 --> 41:43.360]  announces oh by the way we are kim trailing you with a huge secret program and then you look
[41:43.360 --> 41:49.760]  at the science they're trying to heat the earth tell me why they're doing that they won't say
[41:49.760 --> 41:56.000]  they tell the public the earth's heating but they're trying to heat the earth
[41:56.560 --> 42:03.920]  nasa reports the planet's 20 darker from all the spring they admit their spring barium salts
[42:03.920 --> 42:08.480]  and aluminum dioxide on us and people just say oh that guy he's a nut oh yeah they just admit
[42:08.480 --> 42:13.200]  they're doing it i'm a nut hey you like your little kids being sprayed with aluminum dioxide
[42:13.200 --> 42:17.760]  and barium salts you like your kids being injected with mercury you like sodium fluoride
[42:17.760 --> 42:22.560]  and hundreds of other chemicals they add to the water to brain damage you and sterilize your butt
[42:22.560 --> 42:23.920]  you think that's cute and funny
[42:27.440 --> 42:28.160]  ah man
[42:30.800 --> 42:34.960]  i mean i can't even get austinites to admit that they're openly announcing
[42:35.680 --> 42:40.800]  that two major towns and now five other towns are announcing behind them that they're going to dump
[42:40.800 --> 42:46.240]  sewage directly in the water and i read the type of sewage treatment it's a light treatment
[42:46.240 --> 42:52.160]  where they just break up all the feces and urine and tampons and everything else that gets flushed
[42:52.160 --> 42:57.760]  down the toilet and all the toilet paper and they grind it up and then they spew it out into the water
[43:03.920 --> 43:09.520]  and why not in los angeles the water supply they give the public is toilet to tap it all
[43:09.520 --> 43:13.760]  comes out of the sewage treatment plant with hundreds and hundreds of chemicals added
[43:13.760 --> 43:18.800]  tastes like gasoline and then the feds give la awards for the best water in the country
[43:21.040 --> 43:24.480]  that's like walking up to somebody and shooting them 10 times in the head with a 45
[43:25.120 --> 43:28.560]  and then saying i'm going to give you an award for the best haircut
[43:32.400 --> 43:38.880]  i mean it's just it's just total we have a mass mentally ill society and i go back to this analogy
[43:38.880 --> 43:44.240]  and i'm going to put this parable this this this side by side comparison in the new
[43:44.240 --> 43:47.120]  fall of republic we're going to have out next year it's on eugenics
[43:49.680 --> 43:52.480]  we've told you who the global star what their plan is what they're doing currently the next
[43:52.480 --> 43:56.160]  one's going to show you just exactly what their final plan is and what they're currently up to
[43:56.160 --> 44:03.280]  with the eugenics and you go back to meso america the toll text them all next the aztecs the entire
[44:03.280 --> 44:12.000]  mayan society if you teleported back in time 2000 years ago 1500 years ago 600 years ago pre-court
[44:12.000 --> 44:18.880]  test and you teleport yourself back there and this is the mayan historians this is the mayan
[44:18.880 --> 44:24.480]  archaeologists this isn't some propaganda and they would sacrifice tens of thousands of people a
[44:24.480 --> 44:30.480]  year sometimes thousands a day they did it for population control believing that gods were telling
[44:30.480 --> 44:34.720]  them that the earth was too populated and the all the other sub tribes who they would go out and
[44:34.720 --> 44:39.840]  capture and keep as slaves had to be killed and the gods needed blood and they would sit there
[44:39.840 --> 44:43.680]  cutting their wives their daughters their children's hearts out they didn't just kill their neighbors
[44:45.200 --> 44:49.120]  they would kill the handsomest the smartest the tallest that's why the people are so short down
[44:49.120 --> 44:56.880]  there and nothing wrong being short it's a fact then certain tribal characteristics of the priest
[44:56.880 --> 45:03.680]  class of certain facial expressions search certain facial traits were where the only people allowed
[45:03.680 --> 45:09.760]  to live and so that's why you have that certain look of people down there and if you teleported
[45:09.760 --> 45:14.960]  if you time machine if you climbed in a time machine and went back 700 years to what's in
[45:14.960 --> 45:19.680]  mexico's city in that valley today you would witness unholy hellraiser
[45:19.680 --> 45:29.040]  Hades the priest dragging strings with glass through their tongues in hallucinations of pain
[45:29.040 --> 45:36.080]  through their genitalia hearts being cut out blood spilling and if you told them your culture is
[45:36.080 --> 45:42.880]  crazy and sick and wrong they would say you were nuts you know the old parable of the king an evil
[45:42.880 --> 45:47.920]  witch came and poisoned the well to make the people evil and insane and the wise king went and
[45:47.920 --> 45:51.600]  drank from the well so he would be insane as well i don't think that's wisdom
[45:55.840 --> 45:59.840]  and what am i supposed to drink from the well and go yeah abortion and killing old people's good
[45:59.840 --> 46:03.840]  and the cover of newsweek saying the case for killing granny and how great it is to euthanize
[46:03.840 --> 46:08.800]  people even if they don't want it so he goes from it's a right to kill yourself to oh we're
[46:08.800 --> 46:15.520]  going to kill you and oh it's good to take foster children and test poisons on them and drugs and
[46:15.520 --> 46:20.880]  and pesticides on them and oh it's good and it's good to put sewage in the water and oh you get
[46:20.880 --> 46:30.000]  an award for the best water it's an insane decadent blasphemous system most the churches are whore
[46:30.000 --> 46:52.720]  houses 501c 3 whores and it just gets worse and worse and worse and worse and worse until
[46:52.720 --> 46:58.160]  total insanity until nothing that lacked uniform police and citizens spies are dragging people
[46:58.160 --> 47:02.160]  out of their houses and taking them to slave camps and shooting people in the back of the head and
[47:02.160 --> 47:07.680]  raping your women and forced abortions and forced injections and mass death all around us like
[47:07.680 --> 47:15.200]  africa or some countries 44 have hiv and they're just going to slowly turn the heat up and slaughter
[47:15.200 --> 47:19.280]  everybody and cops are going to love their petty authority and love giving people tickets and
[47:19.280 --> 47:24.320]  helping the cps take kids and they're going to trust the system when they get cancer at 45 and
[47:24.320 --> 47:29.120]  their wife dies at 30 and their kids get Alzheimer's when they're 20 and they're just going to love
[47:29.120 --> 47:38.160]  and trust the system and go right to hell the whole country the whole world sliding in to a
[47:38.160 --> 47:43.920]  wonderland as the establishment turns our atmosphere our cultural atmosphere our spiritual
[47:43.920 --> 47:50.080]  atmosphere into hell the earth is being turned into hell the earth is being turned into upside
[47:50.080 --> 47:56.640]  down poison where everything good is derided and pulled down and stomped on and trampled and everything
[47:57.440 --> 48:03.920]  evil is risen up and and exalted as goodness and exalted as beauty

[54:35.600 --> 54:44.240]  a peat bog so that the harvest would be good that year you'd try to tell the druids that it was
[54:44.240 --> 54:49.200]  insane what they were doing that it was stupid and they would think that you were a lunatic
[54:49.200 --> 54:54.560]  same thing with the aztecs and it's the same thing today people think sewage water is good to drink
[54:54.560 --> 54:59.040]  they think hundreds of poisons put in the water supply under the name fluoride is good
[54:59.760 --> 55:04.240]  they think world government is good they don't say wait the media denied world

[1:03:01.280 --> 1:03:07.440]  or not is they put out very similar headlines and videos and they're now nationwide they're in
[1:03:07.440 --> 1:03:12.800]  most big cities it's a fake newspaper but they mirror what's really going on and then every
[1:03:12.800 --> 1:03:16.960]  time i talk about all the real congressman i had on about how they were threatened with
[1:03:16.960 --> 1:03:26.560]  martial law last year if they didn't hand over full control to the foreign banks
[1:03:27.200 --> 1:03:31.440]  over the issuance of currency and credit that there would be martial law so now when i have
[1:03:32.320 --> 1:03:40.960]  congressman ron paul and senator inhofe went public uh and and many others on about this
[1:03:40.960 --> 1:03:46.880]  yes i'm having one of those memory slips who no i wasn't alan grayson who who was the other
[1:03:46.880 --> 1:03:54.000]  congressman who originally he's in my who yes brad sherman that's it from california

[1:03:58.160 --> 1:04:03.200]  week that i see trying to scan through them and see comments on youtube going alex jones is the
[1:04:03.200 --> 1:04:08.160]  one that put out the fake onion video alex jones is the one that said that congress called for
[1:04:08.160 --> 1:04:16.800]  martial law so do you see how they operate i can have paul on we can have cover the inhofe
[1:04:16.800 --> 1:04:24.560]  statements to the media we can have uh other congressman on they don't care they do straw men
[1:04:24.560 --> 1:04:29.440]  they also go out on the web and say that i'm saying space aliens are landing and that i'm saying
[1:04:30.000 --> 1:04:34.880]  all these things i never said that's a straw man but but i'm not criticizing you you took the bait
[1:04:34.880 --> 1:04:41.680]  it's made to look like c span but it's onion span of you and its representative john howler
[1:04:41.680 --> 1:04:48.560]  republican pennsylvania 12th district totally and completely fake and put out after real congressman
[1:04:48.560 --> 1:04:55.120]  went public that's how the new order rolls and they put classified swine flu martial law plan
[1:04:56.320 --> 1:05:02.480]  done by design to discredit everything this is alex jones with five good reasons you should
[1:05:02.480 --> 1:05:07.760]  consider buying a solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily double or
[1:05:07.760 --> 1:05:12.880]  triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control how much power your
[1:05:12.880 --> 1:05:18.160]  electric company allows you to have it's true total government control of electricity in the name
[1:05:18.160 --> 1:05:23.440]  of smart grid technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is
[1:05:23.440 --> 1:05:28.720]  dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem
[1:05:28.720 --> 1:05:33.840]  number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of families
[1:05:33.840 --> 1:05:38.400]  lose their power from weather related onages number five a solar power generator provides
[1:05:38.400 --> 1:05:42.480]  powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks i really believe in the solar powered
[1:05:42.480 --> 1:05:47.280]  generators offered by solutions from science one of my oldest sponsors you can get more information

[1:07:13.120 --> 1:07:19.120]  americans at home and have turned an endless influence on our president in congress and they really
[1:07:19.120 --> 1:07:25.520]  are calling the shots i think it's incumbent upon all of us as american citizens to pay attention
[1:07:25.520 --> 1:07:31.360]  full of the republic identifies the enemies of our nation the criminal offshore cartel held
[1:07:31.360 --> 1:07:36.480]  bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government tim geithner
[1:07:36.480 --> 1:07:41.200]  Bernanke the arsonists they're asking for more matches and the congress is saying who do we make

[1:08:45.360 --> 1:08:50.560]  only going to be phone calls one phone call after the other i'm going to do a news blitz here in
[1:08:50.560 --> 1:08:58.240]  just a moment but first let's run through four or five more calls quickly david in ohio you're on the
[1:08:58.240 --> 1:09:06.720]  air yes sir i like your input on this i've been looking at the proper order to purpose structure
[1:09:06.720 --> 1:09:12.400]  and i come up with things are either planned things can happen by accident or things are
[1:09:12.400 --> 1:09:21.200]  experimental is there anything else to that a line of thinking well that's in the realm of human
[1:09:21.200 --> 1:09:28.240]  activity then there's nature both on terra firma in the atmosphere and then from space
[1:09:28.960 --> 1:09:34.000]  meteor impacts comets solar radiation fluctuations in the sun dealing with weather
[1:09:34.000 --> 1:09:40.160]  the sun is the greatest driver and arbiter of things non-human but we spring from the
[1:09:40.160 --> 1:09:47.360]  life-giving energies of the sun supplied to us by the creator but i agree with you and the
[1:09:47.360 --> 1:09:54.000]  establishment has chaos models where they can even predict major trends in human society and
[1:09:54.000 --> 1:10:00.560]  development that's what most of their surveillance grids and psychological algorithm profiles
[1:10:00.560 --> 1:10:08.080]  profiles that they garner from google and tivo and the cable systems and your cell phones and the
[1:10:08.080 --> 1:10:15.280]  nsa tapping is so they can predict random chaos models and find order in the chaos and so they
[1:10:15.280 --> 1:10:22.320]  can set up systems to get more power out of naturally occurring crises and this is declassified
[1:10:22.320 --> 1:10:28.800]  that they do this but then also they will trigger their own crises provocateur crises or purely
[1:10:28.800 --> 1:10:35.280]  carry out crises uh and show uh this is what the social engineers are into and they point out that
[1:10:35.280 --> 1:10:40.400]  they are the humans that are involved in this they're the humans that care about this they are the
[1:10:40.400 --> 1:10:46.160]  people that have their business together and are focused they also have to be very cold-blooded very
[1:10:46.160 --> 1:10:52.400]  controlling and and and just horrible control freaks and because good people who are just as
[1:10:52.400 --> 1:10:59.760]  intelligent but uh not as involved and the society's been designed to keep intelligent
[1:11:00.320 --> 1:11:06.800]  altruistic people from being involved or to have altruistic individuals and groups a lot of us have
[1:11:06.800 --> 1:11:13.120]  our energy sapped by false paradigms believing we're aiding and good when we're actually serving
[1:11:13.120 --> 1:11:18.960]  the aims of the scientific dictatorship but you're talking about philosophy here so please elaborate
[1:11:18.960 --> 1:11:26.720]  on your point well actually what i was trying to do is come up with a very easy method of
[1:11:26.720 --> 1:11:32.240]  determination you know and instead of voting for the lesser of two evils and taking us down an evil
[1:11:32.240 --> 1:11:40.000]  path in the end of you know going constitutional and what is unconstitutional snipping it off at
[1:11:40.000 --> 1:11:45.680]  the bud it's just not acceptable absolutely you have to vote on conscience and on morals you have
[1:11:45.680 --> 1:11:51.840]  to vote on what's right but people like to feel like it's a football team or baseball team they
[1:11:51.840 --> 1:11:57.840]  want to have the bandwagon they want to vote for the winner george bush in 2001 2000 they want to
[1:11:57.840 --> 1:12:04.480]  vote for the winner barack obama in 2008 they want to feel like they're part of the power structure
[1:12:04.480 --> 1:12:08.560]  and so many of these fake churches and good old boys and mainline liberals and mainline
[1:12:08.560 --> 1:12:16.000]  conservatives they are drunk on the imaginary power of associating their personal power with the power
[1:12:16.000 --> 1:12:23.200]  structure kind of how um you know i looked at the uh the banking thing people's will was to have credit
[1:12:23.200 --> 1:12:29.200]  and more but they never saw credit leads to receivership and they never understood that
[1:12:29.200 --> 1:12:35.040]  the credit economy is run by a parasitic banking structure that creates fake paper so how does a
[1:12:35.040 --> 1:12:40.960]  group with fake made up unlimited fiat paper how do they get control of a society when the
[1:12:40.960 --> 1:12:47.520]  society has real tangible property intellectual ideas and labor they create an economic structure
[1:12:47.520 --> 1:12:53.600]  where it is impossible to operate outside of the credit paradigm they deindustrialized they
[1:12:53.600 --> 1:13:00.640]  bankrupt they tax they regulate so that you are forced by wrecking the ship of society onto the
[1:13:00.640 --> 1:13:06.480]  wreckage of the ship that is the government to now serve them then they can remold society
[1:13:07.040 --> 1:13:13.200]  in the image that they wish to create this is the heart of the spirit and the mindset of our
[1:13:13.200 --> 1:13:19.280]  adversary yeah with this uh debt based economy even if everyone was allowed to bank 30 percent
[1:13:19.280 --> 1:13:23.280]  or could bank on what they made the country is still running debt because they're paying interest
[1:13:23.280 --> 1:13:33.200]  on the full amount of money printed yes yes thank you sir well said very well said i lose track of
[1:13:33.200 --> 1:13:40.560]  college was that louis or david okay good that's what i thought it was thank you david we're gonna

[1:14:10.560 --> 1:14:23.360]  good that's what springs from our basic programming or truth is honored where honor is number one
[1:14:24.320 --> 1:14:29.600]  when your family is number one when doing the right thing is number one when being true
[1:14:29.600 --> 1:14:34.000]  true blue when people know you can be counted on that is the greatest wealth
[1:14:34.000 --> 1:14:43.280]  but they take that away and sell you debt and disease and weakness and lies and fraud and mental
[1:14:43.280 --> 1:14:54.320]  illness bill in ohio you're on the air oh and alex good sir hey you opened my eyes up about
[1:14:54.320 --> 1:14:58.640]  a year and a half ago and i just want to say god bless you man i appreciate it god bless you
[1:14:58.640 --> 1:15:05.200]  i just had a quick story for you i uh i stopped a mosquito truck that was running down my street
[1:15:05.200 --> 1:15:10.960]  spraying chemicals in the air oh yeah it's bad stuff yeah and i asked them you know if they could
[1:15:10.960 --> 1:15:16.240]  show me a sheet if uh what they were spraying into the air and the girl just kept telling me
[1:15:16.240 --> 1:15:20.400]  back away from the car sir i'm gonna call the police and i was like what are you talking about i
[1:15:20.400 --> 1:15:24.480]  just had to try to ask you what you do is you go to the city council or the village or the county
[1:15:24.480 --> 1:15:30.720]  commissioners uh whoever's funding this and then you can get a list that way and the problem is
[1:15:30.720 --> 1:15:38.000]  they got rid of ddt and it did cause some problems in large birds that eat fish that were eating krill
[1:15:38.000 --> 1:15:43.840]  and shrimp and worms and smaller fish that were coming out of rivers into the ocean so it did really
[1:15:43.840 --> 1:15:50.080]  mess up pelicans and eagles and things like that to eat fish but ddt i've looked at the molecular
[1:15:50.080 --> 1:15:55.280]  makeup i've interviewed toxicologists on the show and there's been many books written on the subject
[1:15:55.280 --> 1:16:02.560]  ddt is much less toxic to humans uh than the new chemicals they spray and i got home
[1:16:04.080 --> 1:16:10.000]  about five and a half years ago it was right after my grandmother died i remember and i got home at
[1:16:10.000 --> 1:16:17.360]  about three a.m from editing at the office an assessment flew over at about 250 feet i thought
[1:16:17.360 --> 1:16:22.320]  it was dangerously low at some of the big high tension wires that were nearby i believe it was
[1:16:22.320 --> 1:16:27.840]  illegal unless they got an f a waiver and it had spray nozzles spraying a cloud and i sat there to
[1:16:27.840 --> 1:16:33.520]  smell it because i wanted to know what they were spraying uh curiosity killed the cat and it it was
[1:16:33.520 --> 1:16:43.120]  a chemical and i went inside and i search engineed uh aerial spraying insect eradication austin texas
[1:16:43.120 --> 1:16:50.240]  and sure enough they had a year long contract uh for during the spring summer and fall
[1:16:50.240 --> 1:16:57.600]  to spray for some type of uh chinese moth and i read what the chemical was very poisonous to
[1:16:57.600 --> 1:17:03.280]  humans and just so happens to be associated with infertility in mammals so how the globalist
[1:17:03.280 --> 1:17:11.360]  operate is there are thousands of pesticides and they'll pick the pesticides that interfere
[1:17:11.360 --> 1:17:17.360]  with human reproduction and then it's hidden in plain view the guy spraying it doesn't know
[1:17:18.080 --> 1:17:22.640]  and then i tried to tell people on air about the spring and they laughed and giggled but uh
[1:17:22.640 --> 1:17:28.640]  absolutely i've been down at port aransas and this truck drives around at like 10 p.m almost every
[1:17:28.640 --> 1:17:34.240]  time i'm down there if i go out to the 711 or whatever or the local it's not 711 it's stripes
[1:17:34.880 --> 1:17:39.680]  in order to buy some milk or whatever uh my wife would like how the kids are asleep we forgot milk
[1:17:39.680 --> 1:17:43.920]  we'll get some and you know eggs for breakfast and i see the truck's driving around and boy
[1:17:43.920 --> 1:17:48.400]  does it does it stink when you smell that poison what was your other comment on that subject
[1:17:49.040 --> 1:17:54.240]  um well actually now the the county is now bringing me to court and putting charges against
[1:17:54.240 --> 1:18:00.080]  me uh fourth degree misdemeanor for enticing uh and trying to fight with the uh mosquito truck
[1:18:00.080 --> 1:18:05.440]  driver when all i was doing was asking questions oh so see it goes further the person's on a power
[1:18:05.440 --> 1:18:11.360]  trip uh well listen listen you just get a jury trial and you let them know you're gonna sue them
[1:18:11.360 --> 1:18:16.400]  and you sue the individual for filing a false report that matter if if they win or not you
[1:18:16.400 --> 1:18:20.640]  just sue them then they're gonna have to respond they think you're just there to be a victim give
[1:18:20.640 --> 1:18:26.800]  them some of their own medicines and uh and and call them in and say did i just talk to you and
[1:18:26.800 --> 1:18:31.280]  you said get back from the truck uh and you know it's my it's my right to ask what you're spraying
[1:18:31.280 --> 1:18:36.640]  i mean see they got all these new prisons they gotta put people in them and so that's why they're
[1:18:36.640 --> 1:18:44.720]  going after you uh so so so i mean how did this end the police came um no the cops never showed
[1:18:44.720 --> 1:18:49.920]  up but i had to go file a i had to go make a statement at the police uh department and even
[1:18:49.920 --> 1:18:54.160]  the cops said the county's been calling me like five times trying to put this thing through trial
[1:18:54.160 --> 1:18:59.360]  he's like this is crazy he's like there's there's no evidence of any kind yeah he's not gonna rise
[1:18:59.360 --> 1:19:03.840]  through the ranks they'll get rid of him and hire some felon or something uh or you know he'll end up
[1:19:03.840 --> 1:19:10.160]  washing police cars out back uh i mean this is insane but but sir i see articles like this in
[1:19:10.160 --> 1:19:16.800]  the news i see articles every week where police come and arrest people for flying upside down
[1:19:16.800 --> 1:19:20.480]  american flags they think it's illegal when you're supposed to fly it if the country
[1:19:20.480 --> 1:19:25.920]  hadn't in crisis i don't know when it ever will be so so i guess you walk back in your house and

[1:19:34.160 --> 1:19:37.920]  but i just thought you know it's my duty as american to stand up and ask questions you know
[1:19:37.920 --> 1:19:46.640]  what is this wicked counting um weak counting yeah yeah and that's hey man i saw i saw police
[1:19:46.640 --> 1:19:51.360]  bite old women coming out of shops with grocery bags with police dogs and when the old women
[1:19:51.360 --> 1:19:55.520]  complained they went ahead and arrested them and charged them those old women's lives are over

[1:25:24.560 --> 1:25:30.560]  talking letters to the editor calling in to talk radio and plugging the film making copies of it

[1:25:47.360 --> 1:25:52.240]  that you're on a power trip and they'll get that little demonic glow of i love being a slave i think
[1:25:52.240 --> 1:25:58.080]  it's cute i'm a deep down coward so i've crime stopped i've subconsciously decided i love tyranny
[1:25:58.640 --> 1:26:03.120]  you know you could put a bucket of sewage in front of them and they ate it like it was apple pie
[1:26:03.120 --> 1:26:09.840]  just move on from the biological slave hey alex i just want to point out i i see a lot of people
[1:26:09.840 --> 1:26:16.000]  who uh in my line of work i'm a bartender and uh there's a lot of disgust and a lot of angst out
[1:26:16.000 --> 1:26:21.680]  there uh but i want to go ahead and i get right to the reason i called you uh i just picked up my
[1:26:21.680 --> 1:26:29.360]  mail a little bit ago and i got something from our friends at fema in the mail and uh yeah and what
[1:26:29.360 --> 1:26:36.000]  it is is it says uh let me get to the right page here uh important information about your flood
[1:26:36.000 --> 1:26:41.200]  insurance coverage yeah they federal i was about to say that they're federalizing everything in the
[1:26:41.200 --> 1:26:46.160]  name of flood plains and expanding the flood plains everywhere even people on mountaintops are
[1:26:46.160 --> 1:26:51.760]  now being put in them so fema can control development right and on the one page it says
[1:26:51.760 --> 1:26:57.840]  it's the acknowledgement of receipt and it says the person listed on the policy as the name insurer
[1:26:57.840 --> 1:27:05.040]  should sign and date this form yeah well they announced 10 years ago in the 2000 census in 99
[1:27:05.040 --> 1:27:10.000]  when they were getting rolling that they were going to start a yearly census by 2009 and
[1:27:10.000 --> 1:27:13.680]  that you're just now going to get stuff in the mail saying we're going to arrest you if you
[1:27:13.680 --> 1:27:18.080]  don't fill this out no more fifth amendment i mean you could be caught in a basement with 14 dead
[1:27:18.080 --> 1:27:24.240]  bodies covered with axe wounds all over them and the police couldn't compel you to incriminate yourself
[1:27:24.240 --> 1:27:30.160]  but they get up there like roosters up on the church top and say you've got to fill out every
[1:27:30.160 --> 1:27:36.560]  form we say and everybody just rolls over like jellyfish and does it and i just i want to just
[1:27:36.560 --> 1:27:41.920]  bring that to you and your listeners attention because uh i think this is one of those examples
[1:27:41.920 --> 1:27:46.400]  of your your color or law thing where it doesn't say you have to do it but that you should do it
[1:27:47.680 --> 1:27:52.000]  absolutely you should drink fluoride water they have public service announcements now on radio
[1:27:52.000 --> 1:27:56.880]  and tv i've seen them and i'm so busy i haven't even taped it you know you always catch it and
[1:27:56.880 --> 1:28:04.880]  you don't have a vcr dvd recording or dvr recording uh but uh they're now going tap water the healthiest
[1:28:04.880 --> 1:28:09.840]  the best the bottled water can be dangerous and uses a few examples of where it's been bad bottled
[1:28:09.840 --> 1:28:13.760]  water and it certainly can be if they don't clean the filtering systems when they're making it and
[1:28:13.760 --> 1:28:18.400]  then when it finally gets overflowed all the poison that's backed up tens of thousands of gallons
[1:28:18.400 --> 1:28:23.200]  worth of water that's been treated all of it then basically precipitates out into the bottled water
[1:28:23.200 --> 1:28:27.200]  that's why you got to filter it yourself but they'll all these public service announcements
[1:28:27.200 --> 1:28:31.600]  don't don't drink bottled water don't don't filter it we're the government we love you so much we
[1:28:31.600 --> 1:28:36.560]  care so much about your teeth just please drink it everything's gonna be fine just trust us we care
[1:28:36.560 --> 1:28:41.280]  so much about you take the vaccine oh don't read all our government textbooks and policy reports
[1:28:41.280 --> 1:28:45.520]  that we want to poison you and sterilize you just believe us we're so good oh we just want to help
[1:28:45.520 --> 1:28:52.080]  you please oh guys we love you i mean it's just so sick and evil i mean imagine that if somebody
[1:28:52.080 --> 1:28:56.240]  would have made a science fiction movie 50 years ago well they were putting poison in the water
[1:28:56.240 --> 1:29:02.400]  and had public service announcements about be sure and drink your fluoride water give it to your
[1:29:02.400 --> 1:29:10.800]  children it's good don't believe the conspiracy theory i mean doesn't that creep all of you out
[1:29:10.800 --> 1:29:16.160]  can't you see through it can't you get your heads out of the sand can't you stand up for your family
[1:29:16.160 --> 1:29:21.680]  can't you go to the city councils and county commissioners and say get the fluoride out of my
[1:29:21.680 --> 1:29:27.680]  stinking water dog meat get it out you filthy controlled freak environmentalist murderer

[1:29:53.840 --> 1:30:04.080]  the run alex jones and the gcn radio network hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in
[1:30:04.080 --> 1:30:10.400]  the last century alone this is our last chance to not relive history as we're finishing off this agenda
[1:30:11.200 --> 1:30:16.160]  that we're pulling the rug from underneath americans at home i've determined its influence
[1:30:16.160 --> 1:30:22.320]  on our president in congress and they really are calling the shots i think it's incumbent upon all of

[1:38:38.640 --> 1:38:49.520]  i need to hire an extra it person desperately we need three i mean these guys were up here this
[1:38:49.520 --> 1:38:55.200]  weekend when we had a server crash with the mail server we had this whole system go haywire sunday
[1:38:55.200 --> 1:39:02.800]  where bermas couldn't even do a show i'm not complaining uh we have had just constant issues
[1:39:02.800 --> 1:39:07.600]  and we've had consultants in here they say our it guys are extremely talented and are doing a
[1:39:07.600 --> 1:39:14.880]  fabulous job but uh there's just too much for them to do because they're busy fixing broken
[1:39:14.880 --> 1:39:20.400]  computers and all sorts other stuff and dealing with this but uh so please continue to support us
[1:39:20.400 --> 1:39:26.960]  ladies and gentlemen uh because we have a great cost here okay let's start over timothy bald one
[1:39:26.960 --> 1:39:31.120]  with the point you were making about having to have your head examined if you
[1:39:31.120 --> 1:39:38.080]  you think the government isn't out of control go ahead yeah you know alex i think the the
[1:39:38.080 --> 1:39:43.680]  by our as our founder said that the the evidences are clear of the usurpations and the abuses of
[1:39:43.680 --> 1:39:49.280]  government i mean you know we can sit here and talk for months and months about the corruption
[1:39:49.280 --> 1:39:54.400]  that we've seen and what we believe it means and where it's leading us i think that the evidence
[1:39:54.400 --> 1:40:00.960]  is very clear that they're trying to unite the nations in a global type economy and
[1:40:00.960 --> 1:40:07.600]  structure uh of course this goes um this goes in line with their their desire for power and money
[1:40:08.320 --> 1:40:13.520]  this is the nature of mankind uh to to use other people for their advantage and this is what we're
[1:40:13.520 --> 1:40:19.600]  seeing you know and and what i have what i have tried to do is i have tried to study history
[1:40:20.240 --> 1:40:28.160]  and are particularly our history to see what cures there are for this type of abuse and this
[1:40:28.160 --> 1:40:34.160]  type of encroachment and you know my conclusion is that it's similar to what alexander hampton
[1:40:34.160 --> 1:40:39.280]  said and of course i'm no i'm no fan of alexander hampton but i believe what he said in the federal
[1:40:39.280 --> 1:40:47.280]  newspapers was very true and that is to to um to best preserve freedom you need power to be able
[1:40:47.280 --> 1:40:53.920]  to check power and of course in the context of what he said there was that the state governments
[1:40:53.920 --> 1:40:59.680]  were to be used to check the federal government and that's something we have a separation of powers
[1:40:59.680 --> 1:41:05.280]  powers set against themselves and that was one of the few issues that the founders uh unanimously
[1:41:05.280 --> 1:41:11.280]  agreed upon they just debated about how to arrange uh that structure and they did a lot off the greek
[1:41:11.280 --> 1:41:16.640]  and of course the common law in england and of course off the dutch system uh as you know
[1:41:17.280 --> 1:41:21.280]  but now that's been undermined by the foreign offshore corporations that's why we need to take
[1:41:21.280 --> 1:41:26.480]  over the local governments and that's why we need to also as patriots take over the government and
[1:41:26.480 --> 1:41:31.520]  have the long view of history and that's why we need to financially support alternative media and
[1:41:31.520 --> 1:41:38.320]  institutions so that we can grow our power uh to then be able to face down the establishment go ahead
[1:41:39.120 --> 1:41:42.800]  well you know and and this is something that i'm trying to educate people when i when i talk
[1:41:42.800 --> 1:41:47.280]  and when i write about this subject you know if you when you study our history one thing is very
[1:41:47.280 --> 1:41:54.240]  clear our founders and and the ratifiers of our constitution rejected the national form of government
[1:41:54.240 --> 1:42:00.480]  and they uh they were very clear that what they wanted was a federal system that is the states
[1:42:00.480 --> 1:42:06.320]  had co-equal power with regard to all the powers that they retained under the tenth amendment
[1:42:06.320 --> 1:42:12.400]  and nine of course and the ninth amendment as well and but the problem what we have here if we look
[1:42:12.400 --> 1:42:18.240]  through the u.s supreme court decisions we have a complete reversal of that idea and that that uh
[1:42:18.240 --> 1:42:23.680]  that understanding and that starts after the civil war does it not well it started before
[1:42:23.680 --> 1:42:31.520]  that because the the u.s particularly under um under um joseph story's court and also of course
[1:42:31.520 --> 1:42:38.000]  john marshall they tried they tried to establish through their decisions that the federal court
[1:42:38.000 --> 1:42:43.440]  or me that the federal government was a supreme sovereignty over the state sop sovereignty through
[1:42:43.440 --> 1:42:48.720]  the supremacy clause and what they tried to establish was the u.s supreme court has the
[1:42:48.720 --> 1:42:54.400]  ultimate final decision on what the constitution means and that's just contrary to what our federal
[1:42:54.400 --> 1:43:00.560]  system is all about it is power checking power state power checking federal power and as you
[1:43:00.560 --> 1:43:05.760]  just mentioned after the civil war they really were able to grab a hold of that idea and force
[1:43:05.760 --> 1:43:10.400]  the states to do what they want them to want them to do and that's been one of the one of the biggest
[1:43:10.400 --> 1:43:16.560]  detrimental causes of freedom in in our country today absolutely uh and from the beginning the
[1:43:16.560 --> 1:43:23.360]  founder stated it was a confederation of states that met to arbitrate their disputes in the federal
[1:43:23.360 --> 1:43:29.840]  congress but that anytime a state wanted to leave or a state uh wanted to make deals with with with
[1:43:29.840 --> 1:43:33.920]  with with someone else they were allowed to do that under the ninth and tenth amendment
[1:43:33.920 --> 1:43:39.360]  we've seen a total reversal and then once you have a centralized federal all-powerful government
[1:43:39.360 --> 1:43:45.920]  it can then be taken over by foreign offshore governments or private institutions and that's
[1:43:45.920 --> 1:43:51.680]  now happened yes exactly and you know alex if there's one thing i would i would wish people
[1:43:51.680 --> 1:43:58.400]  would get a concept of and that is the concept that the states have just as much power to defend
[1:43:58.400 --> 1:44:04.800]  freedom as any other sovereign sovereign country or sovereign they must exercise that power they
[1:44:04.800 --> 1:44:09.600]  must and unfortunately for more than a hundred years the states have really not done that it's
[1:44:09.600 --> 1:44:15.440]  only until you know recently that the states were actually becoming more aware of their powers
[1:44:15.440 --> 1:44:20.560]  under the tenth amendment all the retained powers that they have to try to once again reestablish
[1:44:20.560 --> 1:44:25.520]  this uh these ideals of freedom that we hold and it's good to see some of the states doing that
[1:44:25.520 --> 1:44:30.880]  you may i'm sure you're very familiar with the montana uh firearms freedom act which i am actually
[1:44:30.880 --> 1:44:35.520]  a um a part of that litigation by the way well good for those that don't know about it why don't
[1:44:35.520 --> 1:44:41.120]  you tell people well it's a law that was passed in montana and of course in tennessee as well
[1:44:41.120 --> 1:44:45.520]  in other states are introducing this bill but it's got the feds very very scared and it's something
[1:44:45.520 --> 1:44:52.240]  you and your father helped lead another example of ideas putting them into action true leadership
[1:44:52.240 --> 1:44:58.160]  uh it and if others get behind this it is a tide that is going to be unstoppable
[1:44:58.880 --> 1:45:04.720]  exactly because what it says is look if if we create this product in this case it's a gun but
[1:45:04.720 --> 1:45:09.840]  it could be anything if we create this product and we when we sell it within our our sovereign
[1:45:09.840 --> 1:45:15.280]  borders in in this case the state of montana then the federal regulations have no uh no
[1:45:15.280 --> 1:45:20.000]  applicability in that state whatsoever the interstate commerce clause has no authority
[1:45:20.000 --> 1:45:25.920]  exactly and that's what we're trying to do and of course um you know i wasn't the um the great
[1:45:25.920 --> 1:45:30.640]  people in montana that that passed this i didn't influence them i don't think in doing this they
[1:45:30.640 --> 1:45:36.000]  did this on their own and it's catching on like wildfire similar to the state's sovereignty
[1:45:36.000 --> 1:45:40.480]  resolutions but this is something that something that has teeth this is something that has power
[1:45:40.480 --> 1:45:47.520]  behind it because essentially it is reversing about 130 years of us supreme court decisions
[1:45:47.520 --> 1:45:51.840]  that have well actually i'll take that back about 80 years of us supreme court decisions
[1:45:51.840 --> 1:45:56.480]  that have given congress his power to just rough shot over state sovereignty and it's
[1:45:56.480 --> 1:46:01.680]  reversing all that so it's very important but it's things like that that are going to protect
[1:46:02.480 --> 1:46:07.920]  freedom and it's going to to really put the brakes on this new world order if we think stop and
[1:46:07.920 --> 1:46:13.120]  think about it the federal government has absolutely no power to do anything unless the states are
[1:46:13.120 --> 1:46:18.000]  behind them and supporting them so as soon as the states realize that they have the power
[1:46:18.000 --> 1:46:24.080]  to stop this almost overnight we may we may see a chance of restoration in this country but until
[1:46:24.080 --> 1:46:28.800]  we get back to this idea i don't believe that we're going to have much of a chance short of just
[1:46:28.800 --> 1:46:33.280]  outright revolution now i don't think many people want to go down that road because it's of the
[1:46:33.280 --> 1:46:38.080]  cost it entails at this point but but the point is is that we have to get back to the ideas of
[1:46:38.080 --> 1:46:44.160]  federalism which were the protecting guardians of freedom in this country absolutely go through
[1:46:44.160 --> 1:46:51.280]  the battle plan that you break down on this article well um you're referring to the the
[1:46:51.280 --> 1:46:55.600]  freedoms destruction by through constitutional sure and some of the other articles you and the
[1:46:55.600 --> 1:47:00.400]  constitution party your father others have been putting out battle plans dealing with the states
[1:47:00.400 --> 1:47:04.960]  teaching people the right and proper duties of the state and the people that reside within the
[1:47:04.960 --> 1:47:11.360]  states well that that particular article that i wrote uh it really what i try to do is highlight
[1:47:11.360 --> 1:47:18.160]  the fact that during the constitutional convention debates the founders and the ratifiers rejected
[1:47:18.160 --> 1:47:24.720]  this notion that the federal government has the the power to negate state laws and that in other
[1:47:24.720 --> 1:47:31.520]  words under the tenth amendment uh the states the state laws under their sovereignty was not to be
[1:47:31.520 --> 1:47:39.520]  negated by federal uh the federal laws um they rejected that idea so in other words the states
[1:47:39.520 --> 1:47:45.760]  still have the power to do this and it's through the constitutional amendment process that um the
[1:47:45.760 --> 1:47:53.200]  states are to to decide um what they want the constitution to to be uh to preserve the freedoms
[1:47:53.200 --> 1:47:58.640]  and um what i try to do is highlight the fact that this is not what has been told us over the
[1:47:58.640 --> 1:48:03.520]  past 100 years we've been told that the u.s supreme court in the in the federal government
[1:48:03.520 --> 1:48:09.760]  has sovereign supreme sovereignty over the states and it just is not true it was rejected by by the
[1:48:09.760 --> 1:48:14.000]  founders and by the ratifier specifically the history is very clear on this subject alex of
[1:48:14.000 --> 1:48:18.480]  course i'm sure you know it's but your your listeners need to understand that it was this is
[1:48:18.480 --> 1:48:24.640]  very clear we we know that the founders rejected the nationalistic idea that state states are to
[1:48:24.640 --> 1:48:29.920]  have the same co-equal powers that the federal government has with regard to their powers and
[1:48:29.920 --> 1:48:34.960]  that's co-equal on the that's co-equal on the few the three powers delegated to the federal
[1:48:34.960 --> 1:48:39.600]  government the states are actually superior to the federal government because all powers not
[1:48:39.600 --> 1:48:46.320]  expressly delegated to the federal government are expressly reserved to the states or the people
[1:48:46.320 --> 1:48:50.960]  yeah exactly right because you know if you take a look at what they rejected what they actually
[1:48:50.960 --> 1:48:56.080]  proposed during the conventions for the federal government to have power to regulate if you look
[1:48:56.080 --> 1:49:03.120]  at that it it mentioned agriculture it mentioned education it mentioned commerce in general and
[1:49:03.120 --> 1:49:08.320]  they actually rejected those and removed those from the the federal government's power so yes
[1:49:08.320 --> 1:49:15.440]  their power is very very limited and it's only been through this supposed living constitution idea
[1:49:15.440 --> 1:49:23.040]  um that we have been defrauded and criminally i think defrauded from our our natural rights of
[1:49:23.040 --> 1:49:28.400]  compact here and but the but the point of it of the matter is this the states have the power
[1:49:28.400 --> 1:49:34.000]  to reclaim these powers that have been taken taken from them because it it's their power it's the
[1:49:34.000 --> 1:49:38.800]  power that they got from the sovereigns of their state that is the people yes they've usurped our
[1:49:38.800 --> 1:49:45.760]  power and now the state tells us their god and police are taught worshiping the government is
[1:49:45.760 --> 1:49:52.080]  what is patriotic right right it's very dangerous and we we've just come become so used to it we've
[1:49:52.080 --> 1:49:59.040]  become mind slaves to their agenda and we need a serious awakening and enlightenment enlightenment
[1:49:59.040 --> 1:50:05.120]  of this of this understanding but once people understand this it it will cause a a tremendous
[1:50:05.120 --> 1:50:10.960]  movement i believe in restoring our republic because you know it's like the competition of
[1:50:10.960 --> 1:50:18.000]  of of commerce or or the economic competition model this will be a competition of ideas
[1:50:18.000 --> 1:50:23.840]  that will allow the 50 states to once again find out what works best within their state within their
[1:50:23.840 --> 1:50:29.280]  borders and we can have freedom restored to this republic as long as we have this monopolized power
[1:50:29.280 --> 1:50:33.440]  that we are forced to accept at the federal government i don't think there's gonna be much
[1:50:33.440 --> 1:50:38.800]  hope to to get our get ourselves out of this but absolutely and the cohen the cohen tell
[1:50:38.800 --> 1:50:44.400]  me to break the cohen tell pro operives every time we try to build something or a movement
[1:50:44.400 --> 1:50:49.840]  they'll go it's not instant you're stupid we need to just shoot everybody they always turn out to be
[1:50:49.840 --> 1:50:56.880]  feds they know we're in the right and if we just orderly in an orderly way educate people we're
[1:50:56.880 --> 1:51:02.400]  going to win stay there we're right back with him at the Baldwin worried that inflation will ruin

[1:54:12.080 --> 1:54:16.800]  wrote the column freedoms destruction for constitutional deconstruction
[1:54:18.080 --> 1:54:22.320]  got about five minutes left and i'm coming back with phone calls with the first five minutes
[1:54:22.320 --> 1:54:26.640]  segment than a news blitz than more phone calls than lindsay williams you want to hear about the
[1:54:26.640 --> 1:54:32.400]  un openly announcing world government yet again arrogantly and how the carbon tax is the key to
[1:54:32.400 --> 1:54:40.000]  it all and i think the key for us to understand mr. Baldwin is that we are running out of time we
[1:54:40.000 --> 1:54:46.880]  are now here inside the world government instead of corruption that's running rampant just stagnating
[1:54:46.880 --> 1:54:53.840]  it's blooming and now is the time for everybody to start seeing themselves as leaders and getting
[1:54:53.840 --> 1:55:00.640]  involved and it doesn't mean we'll save the world by ourselves but many hands make light work closing
[1:55:00.640 --> 1:55:07.600]  comments timothy baldwin well alex um i think that we are in fact short short of time and i
[1:55:07.600 --> 1:55:14.000]  believe that we are at a decision where similar to our our founding fathers um but like samuel
[1:55:14.000 --> 1:55:20.800]  adams said we either decide to to declare independence now uh and live as free men or we
[1:55:20.800 --> 1:55:27.200]  decide to just uh go along and live as slaves and i truly believe that we are reaching that point
[1:55:27.200 --> 1:55:31.360]  and as you said we are not going to be able to save the world by ourselves but we can try to
[1:55:31.360 --> 1:55:36.240]  save our communities we can try to save our states and that's exactly the model that the
[1:55:36.240 --> 1:55:43.680]  founding fathers gave to us uh to keep uh matters that affect us the most on a state and local level
[1:55:43.680 --> 1:55:48.560]  and when we do that we will keep the federal government and those people who would use us
[1:55:48.560 --> 1:55:55.600]  as their little pawns we will keep them at bay uh to me and we need zero compromise and to know the
[1:55:55.600 --> 1:56:01.200]  politicians tricks both parties and to really get aggressive and just say look i see through all your
[1:56:01.200 --> 1:56:07.840]  corporate scams i know you got handbooks on a lot of me the games are over and if that means
[1:56:07.840 --> 1:56:15.040]  following a corrupt judge as an investigative reporter uh and catching him with hookers if that
[1:56:15.040 --> 1:56:22.080]  means uh you know i mean it's time to start playing hardball with this scum they're all criminals
[1:56:22.880 --> 1:56:28.160]  we need to go after them legally and lawfully i agree with that and i think too it's time for the
[1:56:28.160 --> 1:56:32.400]  people to really start um what i would consider to be ignoring the federal government in other
[1:56:32.400 --> 1:56:39.440]  words um you know don't give them the um the flattery that they're that they're getting from us
[1:56:39.440 --> 1:56:46.560]  um ignore them they're not officials they're not authorities and at the same time go ahead
[1:56:47.280 --> 1:56:52.480]  they're illegitimate alex and um i think with that if we can focus on our state legislators
[1:56:52.480 --> 1:56:58.560]  our state governors judges county commissioners sheriffs if we can start getting those people
[1:56:58.560 --> 1:57:04.000]  to realize our concerns and actually have them represent us and not just us but represent the
[1:57:04.000 --> 1:57:09.840]  principles of freedom i think that we can restore this republic but unfortunately not all states are
[1:57:09.840 --> 1:57:13.760]  going to go along with that there will be some that of course ignore that and we'll go along with
[1:57:13.760 --> 1:57:19.440]  this agenda that has been shoved down our throat for so many years but alex it is time for us to
[1:57:19.440 --> 1:57:26.320]  step up we we we cannot be left lethargic any longer we have to do this now and that's why
[1:57:26.320 --> 1:57:30.000]  i appreciate what you're doing so much well i appreciate what you're doing timothy baldwin
[1:57:30.000 --> 1:57:37.120]  in the footsteps of your father uh but in closing the good news is republicans and democrats i talk
[1:57:37.120 --> 1:57:42.480]  to now know both parties are controlled they finally have figured it out it's been a process but
[1:57:42.480 --> 1:57:47.200]  more more waking up and people aren't saying we need to fix the government they're saying the whole
[1:57:47.200 --> 1:57:53.680]  thing's rotten the whole thing's corrupt the whole thing's evil and it's over and the establishment
[1:57:53.680 --> 1:57:58.320]  knows that that's why they're trying to come in to intimidate people and to bring in this tyranny

[2:01:17.040 --> 2:01:26.560]  hold another office in the un at the un okay are you kidding i mean was all we have news clips
[2:01:26.560 --> 2:01:31.520]  in the film where they say president of the world the chairman of the un security council
[2:01:31.520 --> 2:01:39.680]  has all the power over the un this is historic ap headline uh obama cements u.s relationship with
[2:01:39.680 --> 2:01:47.120]  un by coming first u.s president to sit i mean that's a that is the most important most powerful
[2:01:47.120 --> 2:01:53.920]  position in the un are you saying that he is not currently the chairman of the un security council
[2:01:53.920 --> 2:02:03.040]  no no i'm saying why is this not covered by any mainstream media well i mean watch the film i mean
[2:02:03.040 --> 2:02:08.000]  we'd fit with fair use we'll use a few short clips we have cnn will blitzer talking about it and
[2:02:08.000 --> 2:02:15.600]  another news club i mean i mean it should be a bigger deal our whole media like my god you
[2:02:15.600 --> 2:02:20.960]  cannot hold two government offices at one time yeah it violates article one section none of the
[2:02:20.960 --> 2:02:28.320]  u.s constitution but what did bush say about that why don't we bring this guy why why don't the
[2:02:28.320 --> 2:02:38.000]  citizens of the united states bring this guy to the table and say hey you're you're uh a fascist
[2:02:38.960 --> 2:02:47.840]  you know well listen i appreciate your call skip look obama is a puppet but he was given
[2:02:47.840 --> 2:02:53.200]  the un peace prize they intended the whole time to make him the head of the rotating uh
[2:02:56.000 --> 2:03:01.600]  15 member security council it is the true position in the un the u.s always acts like it
[2:03:01.600 --> 2:03:08.240]  doesn't like to un the united states in 1945 created at the presidio naval base in san
[2:03:08.240 --> 2:03:15.200]  vertica it's run only the security council has power the rest of it is a debating society to
[2:03:15.200 --> 2:03:23.440]  suck in the third world nations to so that they can be paid off at the un and yes it's it's a big
[2:03:23.440 --> 2:03:27.760]  deal that's why on the back cover of the obama deception i'll show you a close shot of that
[2:03:28.400 --> 2:03:32.480]  i make the point president obama has brazenly violated article one section none of the u.s
[2:03:32.480 --> 2:03:36.560]  constitution by seating himself at the head of the united nation security council thus becoming
[2:03:36.560 --> 2:03:40.720]  the first u.s president to chair the world body that's why henry kissinger and all these elitists
[2:03:40.720 --> 2:03:48.080]  were there just in awe and mouths were hanging open when he did it because this was the associated
[2:03:48.080 --> 2:03:54.480]  press said obama brings us into the new world order i mean this this is serious serious big
[2:03:54.480 --> 2:04:00.800]  medicine powerful medicine and it's poison medicine i mean this is big wampum for the new world order
[2:04:00.800 --> 2:04:13.040]  uh to to do this it is it is just such a big deal to have barack obama do this and they're just
[2:04:13.040 --> 2:04:19.520]  training us in le09 fema 14 nations foreign troops training to quote take on american

[2:08:33.600 --> 2:08:44.640]  from two days ago this is from sunday we can do it by van ky moon the united nations does exist
[2:08:44.640 --> 2:08:49.760]  for new listeners he is the secretary general of an organization called the united nations
[2:08:50.400 --> 2:08:54.800]  this was created by private corporate interest it is a private corporate body like the world
[2:08:54.800 --> 2:09:01.520]  trade organization the xm bank the imf world bank its stated goal is to exterminate at least
[2:09:01.520 --> 2:09:10.160]  80% of the population though extremists want total death of the human species and have pledged
[2:09:10.160 --> 2:09:14.320]  to kill themselves when they're the last human standing and we've read the policy reports and
[2:09:14.320 --> 2:09:18.800]  gone over it here when i spoke out against dr eric pionka the ut professor saying he wants to kill
[2:09:18.800 --> 2:09:29.600]  90% of the public with an airborne abola when i covered that i got emails and calls from his
[2:09:29.600 --> 2:09:35.680]  graduate students working in bio weapons and other areas of science saying hey he's a liberal he
[2:09:35.680 --> 2:09:41.440]  only wants to kill 90% humans are a parasite we all must be killed so remember that that their main
[2:09:41.440 --> 2:09:46.640]  goal is eco science the government policy book written by the white house science are calling
[2:09:46.640 --> 2:09:52.720]  for world population reduction sterilization through the water and vaccines just remember that keep
[2:09:52.720 --> 2:09:59.360]  this book right here because it's the most concise 1100 pages but most concise and the
[2:09:59.360 --> 2:10:07.680]  most honest book by these enemies of humanity now he says in this article we want to thank
[2:10:07.680 --> 2:10:12.560]  john carrey senator john carrey and senator lindsay graham for their leadership he says we
[2:10:12.560 --> 2:10:16.800]  are on the verge of the u.s senate this is the head of the u.n the head of the puppet u.n the
[2:10:16.800 --> 2:10:26.800]  head of the general assembly ban chi moon and he says we are on the verge of passing the global
[2:10:26.800 --> 2:10:37.440]  greenhouse gas emissions tax inside the united states and that is in paragraph five of the article
[2:10:37.440 --> 2:10:43.200]  u.s leadership is crucial that is why i'm encouraged by the spirit of compromise shown the bipartisan
[2:10:43.200 --> 2:10:48.160]  initiative announced last week by senator john carrey and senator lindsay graham here was a
[2:10:48.160 --> 2:10:53.040]  pair of u.s senators one republican one democrat coming together to bridge their party differences
[2:10:53.040 --> 2:10:58.960]  to address climate change in a spirit of genuine give and take and he's the guy who attacks ron paul
[2:10:58.960 --> 2:11:06.880]  he knows who his enemy is lindsay graham is an abomination he is an absolute total and complete
[2:11:06.880 --> 2:11:13.840]  abomination he says one thing and does another it says every day this critical december summit
[2:11:13.840 --> 2:11:21.680]  and copenhagen grows closer all agree that climate change is existential threat to humankind so this
[2:11:21.680 --> 2:11:28.160]  is a way to say humankind is bad yet agreement on what to do seems to elude us still it goes on
[2:11:29.440 --> 2:11:36.880]  he says in the third to last paragraph a deal must include an equitable global governance structure
[2:11:38.480 --> 2:11:43.920]  all countries must have a voice and how resources are deployed and managed oh yes you'll have a voice
[2:11:43.920 --> 2:11:51.920]  within the un controlled by private banks on where the resources go that is how trust will be built
[2:11:53.680 --> 2:12:00.400]  and it goes on from there and they are seizing complete control of everything and you search
[2:12:00.400 --> 2:12:05.120]  engine the term global governance hundreds of articles a week say global government or global
[2:12:05.120 --> 2:12:13.840]  governance thousands per week say new world order and then describe it a private banking

[2:14:41.200 --> 2:14:44.720]  ban you owning a gun without it being arrested or charged you just can't own a gun anymore you're
[2:14:44.720 --> 2:14:53.760]  put on a secret list that's what they do now in these articles this is how they operate this is
[2:14:53.760 --> 2:15:02.880]  this is what they're up to and no exaggeration thousands of articles a day state what they're
[2:15:02.880 --> 2:15:09.360]  going to tax this is going to be hell and they mean for you to go bankrupt always get calls
[2:15:09.920 --> 2:15:13.840]  and email saying well who are they going to tax if they bankrupt the salt they print the money
[2:15:13.840 --> 2:15:19.440]  they use the taxing system to destroy independence the power to tax is the power to destroy as
[2:15:19.440 --> 2:15:28.480]  thomas jefferson said phyto aka the climate criminal la times some climate change activists would
[2:15:28.480 --> 2:15:32.560]  take your dog away and spend trillions on other efforts rather than come up with solutions that
[2:15:32.560 --> 2:15:38.160]  could actually work to offset carbon levels so see this is how they do it they know that you want
[2:15:38.160 --> 2:15:43.520]  a choice on whether you're for global taxes or not so they just make it a choice about now come on
[2:15:43.520 --> 2:15:50.640]  we do need to tax cars and oil and your house and beef and and and the crops you grow because
[2:15:50.640 --> 2:15:55.840]  they're putting off carbon dioxide plants don't just put off oxygen and yes the plants are bad
[2:15:55.840 --> 2:15:58.800]  i can pull up articles right now where there's talking about cutting trees down now
[2:16:02.160 --> 2:16:06.960]  you can't make this up in fact people don't believe that jaren search the term
[2:16:06.960 --> 2:16:16.880]  term environmental activists say trees create bad carbon footprint and you'll see them
[2:16:17.760 --> 2:16:20.880]  or if that doesn't bring it up last time i saw it was months ago it was a bunch of articles
[2:16:20.880 --> 2:16:28.720]  i see them all the time but about how we got to cut trees down now oh i'm not joking trees are
[2:16:28.720 --> 2:16:36.240]  able to trees poison but phyto aka the climate criminal some climate change activists and it
[2:16:36.240 --> 2:16:41.360]  goes on rather than come up with solutions that can actually work so see oh we we we do believe
[2:16:41.360 --> 2:16:45.520]  carbon dioxide is a deadly poison even though plants breathe it and then they create oxygen
[2:16:45.520 --> 2:16:50.320]  humans breathe we can't scare you with a word oxygen so we'll scare you with a word carbon
[2:16:50.320 --> 2:16:55.520]  dioxide the government cannot have my dog and then it goes on and this is being called for
[2:16:56.240 --> 2:16:57.440]  by the united nations
[2:16:57.440 --> 2:17:06.720]  and here in my stack here's a times of london climate chief lord stern give up meat to save
[2:17:06.720 --> 2:17:12.800]  the planet and they're banning fireplaces they're banning space eaters but don't worry california
[2:17:12.800 --> 2:17:18.560]  just wants to tax them oh you can have the propane heater in northern california on cold nights
[2:17:18.560 --> 2:17:22.560]  you're just going to pay a tax and we're going to come in your house with local inspectors
[2:17:22.560 --> 2:17:26.800]  to get part of the money because these little chicken neck control freaks they like to boss
[2:17:26.800 --> 2:17:33.120]  people around these were the tattletale rats in school and they are getting swap teams and if you
[2:17:33.120 --> 2:17:36.400]  don't like it they're going to murder you and your family after all you're bad for the earth
[2:17:37.440 --> 2:17:41.280]  people will need to turn vegetarian in if the world is to conquer climate change according
[2:17:41.280 --> 2:17:46.400]  to leading authority on global warming and it's being proposed in fact they've already started
[2:17:46.400 --> 2:17:57.360]  canada's now taxing cows back google that canada just google attacks on cows a lot of sheep farmers
[2:17:57.360 --> 2:18:02.480]  and beef farmers in new zealand and australia are just stopping hundreds of dollars per cow
[2:18:03.040 --> 2:18:05.200]  50 something dollars of 70 plus dollars
[2:18:09.280 --> 2:18:14.880]  oh look at that they'd shoot trees wouldn't they climate law encourages deforestation scientists
[2:18:14.880 --> 2:18:18.080]  say a law of unintended consequences strikes again
[2:18:20.320 --> 2:18:26.720]  the Kyoto protocol and then it gets into i guess how trees are evil but that's not the
[2:18:26.720 --> 2:18:33.520]  exact headline i wanted and this is meant to be outrageous and then you're a criminal if you
[2:18:33.520 --> 2:18:41.680]  deny that it's happening you're bad if you deny that this is going on you are evil if you deny
[2:18:41.680 --> 2:18:47.840]  that this is going on you are wrong you are racist you oh i don't like big government racist oh i don't

[2:25:20.640 --> 2:25:26.080]  now but first we got to crank this part up right here because you can't make us run
[2:25:26.080 --> 2:25:41.920]  all right let's go ahead and go to a clip from fold the republic dealing with barack obama
[2:25:41.920 --> 2:25:47.680]  becoming the chairman of the un security council for anybody out there who's in denial here it is
[2:25:48.720 --> 2:25:54.800]  the finance heads of the 20 industrialized nations met again in late september of 2009
[2:25:54.800 --> 2:26:04.400]  at the g20 summit in pittsburgh pennsylvania at that meeting ministers called for an end to the dollar
[2:26:04.400 --> 2:26:12.720]  as the world reserve currency they also called for a strengthening of global governance and called
[2:26:12.720 --> 2:26:19.120]  for a new world order while the bankers were busy carving up the world at the g20 summit
[2:26:19.120 --> 2:26:25.120]  barack obama was in new york city at the united nations because he's got a new job to chair the
[2:26:25.120 --> 2:26:31.760]  united nations security council the most powerful position in the world government body president
[2:26:31.760 --> 2:26:38.880]  obama does what no other u.s president ever has as president obama presided over the un's most
[2:26:38.880 --> 2:26:45.920]  powerful body that would be the security council 6191 first meeting of the security council for a
[2:26:45.920 --> 2:26:50.880]  couple of hours you could say mr. obama was president of the world it is the story of a
[2:26:50.880 --> 2:26:55.840]  world that understands that no difference or division is worth destroying all that we have
[2:26:55.840 --> 2:27:01.840]  built in my own country it has brought democrats and republican leaders together leaders like
[2:27:01.840 --> 2:27:08.640]  george schultz bill perry henry kissinger and sam nun who are with us here today barack obama is
[2:27:08.640 --> 2:27:15.360]  the first president to hold two posts simultaneously and there's a good reason for that it's illegal
[2:27:15.360 --> 2:27:21.760]  article one section nine of the constitution forbids any u.s president from serving any foreign
[2:27:21.760 --> 2:27:27.520]  government or institution he swears an oath to protect and defend the constitution of the united
[2:27:27.520 --> 2:27:33.280]  states but now barack obama has sworn allegiance to the global government and the united nations
[2:27:33.280 --> 2:27:41.760]  that he heads up let that sink in real good barack obama now heads the united nation security
[2:27:41.760 --> 2:27:49.520]  council you cannot serve two masters and obama isn't he's selling out the last vestiges of sovereignty
[2:27:49.520 --> 2:27:54.960]  that this country had this ladies and gentlemen is the destruction of our nation and it's also high
[2:27:54.960 --> 2:28:05.520]  treason obamas lies are obvious and out in the open he hides in plain sight and from the moment
[2:28:05.520 --> 2:28:11.200]  he took office his lies have only increased despite the fact that his ratings have dramatically
[2:28:11.200 --> 2:28:16.320]  dropped since election day from the mid eighties to the low forties a large portion of americans
[2:28:16.320 --> 2:28:22.080]  still gullibly hang on his every word it is bringing entertainment to thousands of people
[2:28:23.120 --> 2:28:28.720]  through its magic we are able to enjoy a combination of the radio motion pictures and the
[2:28:28.720 --> 2:28:36.080]  stage right in the comfort of our own homes simply by pushing a button and turning a dial
[2:28:36.080 --> 2:28:42.800]  these cells with their electrical charges are scanned by a stream of electrons completing 30
[2:28:42.800 --> 2:28:51.360]  pictures a second compare that crude picture with these of today and you can judge for yourself
[2:28:51.360 --> 2:28:58.400]  how far along the road to perfection television has traveled most people still today think that all
[2:28:58.400 --> 2:29:05.920]  entertainment to do with movies drama is is therefore nothing more than their entertainment
[2:29:05.920 --> 2:29:15.200]  it never ever was that case of course television can't perform such miracles as this yet but
[2:29:15.200 --> 2:29:23.760]  perhaps there's no harm wishing that it could the greatest social social messages are promoted
[2:29:23.760 --> 2:29:29.840]  through movies and drama high drama all right the fixation of emotive sequences yeah they knew
[2:29:29.840 --> 2:29:35.200]  men ran society at the local level and the state didn't want that so the messages about tv and
[2:29:35.200 --> 2:29:41.040]  culture were men you're in charge the women are your slaves that was the message in the 50s
[2:29:41.040 --> 2:29:46.560]  and the cia is declassified it was meant to enrage women to then rebel in the 60s so they
[2:29:46.560 --> 2:29:56.080]  could break the family up now they've done it we're on the march the empires on the run alex

[2:31:23.840 --> 2:31:29.120]  dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem
[2:31:29.120 --> 2:31:34.240]  number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of families
[2:31:34.240 --> 2:31:38.800]  lose their power from weather related onages number five a solar power generator provides
[2:31:38.800 --> 2:31:42.880]  powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks i really believe in the solar powered

[2:36:18.080 --> 2:36:23.120]  top 10 oil company executive that he got to know when he worked with him decades ago
[2:36:23.120 --> 2:36:28.480]  Lindsey had the number one video on youtube and google off and on for months every week it was in
[2:36:28.480 --> 2:36:35.200]  the top 10 tens of millions of views as he presented how there was enough oil to run the
[2:36:35.200 --> 2:36:40.240]  united states over and over and over again a lot more than saudi arabia he talked about that 20
[2:36:40.240 --> 2:36:44.480]  something years ago with his best-selling book the energy non-crisis and the guy called up and said
[2:36:44.480 --> 2:36:49.440]  look you're gonna die you're gonna we're gonna basically kill you if you don't shut up about
[2:36:49.440 --> 2:36:54.800]  this but you can tell your people this how they were gonna lower oil prices from 150 a barrel
[2:36:54.800 --> 2:36:59.200]  to below 50 for the next year and that indeed did happen. Lindsey got laughed at at the time when

[2:38:54.480 --> 2:38:58.720]  a hundred thousand three hundred thousand four hundred thousand two hundred thousand it's already
[2:38:59.520 --> 2:39:03.600]  several million last night i had like five minutes and counted up a few of the big ones
[2:39:03.600 --> 2:39:08.800]  so in five six days we launched it last wednesday so that's six days millions and millions it's
[2:39:08.800 --> 2:39:13.360]  over two million views conservatively very very exciting with all the different versions
[2:39:13.360 --> 2:39:16.640]  a strawman attack will be well this one only says three hundred thousand this one only says two
[2:39:16.640 --> 2:39:22.080]  hundred thousand it's all of them together over two million and like like obama deception
[2:39:22.080 --> 2:39:27.040]  you'll go see four million here a million there two million here half a million there
[2:39:27.040 --> 2:39:32.240]  hundred thousand here it's over twenty million just from what i've counted months ago uh but
[2:39:32.240 --> 2:39:37.360]  that's obama deception so thank you lindsay and i want to say this to you pastor and we've got a
[2:39:37.360 --> 2:39:40.160]  hurry and go to calls that's what we promised to have you here for today and we're very blessed
[2:39:40.160 --> 2:39:43.760]  to have you maybe could stay a little bit longer than past the half hour though i have a news
[2:39:43.760 --> 2:39:46.720]  blitz coming up so we can get to more of these because i'm already going to you later but
[2:39:47.440 --> 2:39:53.600]  i want to say this the the new world order has created a counterfeit of christianity a christianoid
[2:39:53.600 --> 2:39:58.480]  as my uncle calls it fake christianity of all the little glitter bugs and the rest of them up
[2:39:58.480 --> 2:40:05.120]  there on the screen as jack mclam calls them to discredit real christianity and the teachings of
[2:40:05.120 --> 2:40:10.640]  jesus and you look at everything being fulfilled in prophecy you look at all the reality and the
[2:40:10.640 --> 2:40:14.480]  great delusion how folks wouldn't know it was the antichrist when it came because of the rap
[2:40:14.480 --> 2:40:19.200]  you know just just all this propaganda but i want to say this god has really been working with me
[2:40:19.760 --> 2:40:24.560]  to be more focused more professional because i do have this great responsibility and i do recognize
[2:40:24.560 --> 2:40:29.600]  that unfortunately it's a very dangerous position because they have tried to set me up
[2:40:29.600 --> 2:40:35.920]  and destroy me and i cheerfully take my licks wherever they are that i am the greatest threat
[2:40:35.920 --> 2:40:40.560]  to the new world order it's an crazy statement but it's true because my listeners are the greatest
[2:40:40.560 --> 2:40:45.440]  threat to the new world order next to ron paul we're right up there with ron paul kind of twin
[2:40:45.440 --> 2:40:51.920]  peaks as they say and i've been praying every night to help me be more articulate to help me be more
[2:40:51.920 --> 2:40:57.280]  honorable to help me not be as worldly to help me not be as obnoxious to help me not lose my temper
[2:40:57.280 --> 2:41:03.600]  and i i just am overwhelmed and saying why me god but the discernment and everything god's opened up
[2:41:03.600 --> 2:41:08.800]  to me it's a great comfort but also very painful to be able to understand what's happening i know
[2:41:08.800 --> 2:41:12.800]  you're a lot older than i am a pastor has been fighting the globalists for almost 30 years and
[2:41:14.160 --> 2:41:19.280]  it's it's just amazing when you turn yourself over to god and just say god help me be a vessel
[2:41:19.280 --> 2:41:26.400]  a tool to fight tyranny what god has done with with myself and i think of what others could do
[2:41:26.400 --> 2:41:31.760]  if they listened to god and stood up and believed in god and said god i don't have all the answers
[2:41:31.760 --> 2:41:36.480]  and i'm not perfect but i'm going to take action and i'm going to stand up for goodness what we
[2:41:36.480 --> 2:41:43.520]  could do we could change this very quickly uh your comments on that alex i'm so proud of you
[2:41:43.520 --> 2:41:50.880]  you can't imagine when i heard only days ago from the elite now you didn't use the word elite a
[2:41:50.880 --> 2:41:56.880]  moment ago but i'm going to use it now when i after when i heard from one of them just a few days
[2:41:56.880 --> 2:42:03.760]  ago and what he said everything you're doing what you just got through saying he said within two years
[2:42:03.760 --> 2:42:12.160]  we will not recognize america time is of the essence again this this elite told me after two years
[2:42:12.160 --> 2:42:20.240]  you will be so poor you will not be able to do anything this is startling he went on down
[2:42:20.240 --> 2:42:28.880]  to talk about 2012 the dollar will be dead we are talking two years again he said war is planned
[2:42:28.880 --> 2:42:38.080]  after two years he said inflation is going to escalate over a period of two years and then
[2:42:38.080 --> 2:42:46.720]  the elite made it very plain that they have to use this term devil's messiah of a system alex
[2:42:47.280 --> 2:42:52.800]  all of these things the elite has planned they know what they're doing let me stress so it's
[2:42:52.800 --> 2:42:59.520]  powerful as i possibly can their positively is a group of people out there that control the world
[2:42:59.520 --> 2:43:04.800]  everything you've heard on the alex yon show is true i only have the privilege of being on every
[2:43:04.800 --> 2:43:11.200]  now and then but what alex says every single day i can back it up i lived i was the chaplain for the
[2:43:11.200 --> 2:43:17.440]  elite for three years on the trans Alaska oil pipeline i live with these people for three years
[2:43:17.440 --> 2:43:23.360]  very few people even get to know one of them but by the providence of god i had the privilege of
[2:43:23.360 --> 2:43:30.320]  living with them everything alex jones says about these people is true i know i lived it i saw it i
[2:43:30.320 --> 2:43:35.440]  sat across the dinner table from the alex i am so proud of you i don't know what to say i just
[2:43:35.440 --> 2:43:40.960]  wish no i'm proud of you and and and and and pastor i'm actually humbled because i've tried to
[2:43:41.680 --> 2:43:48.000]  whitewash paper over how important the position i'm in because i don't want that i don't have
[2:43:48.000 --> 2:43:52.800]  this high view of myself and i and i know that it's not alex jones that's helped wake up all these
[2:43:52.800 --> 2:43:58.800]  people it was god working through me and my great listeners and we're involved in the most important
[2:43:58.800 --> 2:44:04.960]  thing that we could be i've got the most important job that anybody could have you have the most
[2:44:04.960 --> 2:44:11.840]  important job anybody could have a old washerwoman talking to her neighbors about the new world
[2:44:11.840 --> 2:44:19.360]  ordering about global tax has the most important job we are fighting pure unadulterated death
[2:44:19.360 --> 2:44:25.360]  total destruction kill steal and destroy that is the enemy kill steal and destroy that's all like
[2:44:25.360 --> 2:44:31.200]  a big robot kill steal destroy that's what eco science says that's what the globalist are pushing
[2:44:31.200 --> 2:44:37.040]  let's go to phone calls lindsay thank you alex you bet good to have you here uh venezia you can

[2:45:34.640 --> 2:45:39.520]  may be coming and the feds reported in the late eighties they want to have all of us were radios
[2:45:39.520 --> 2:45:44.080]  tv's even if they're not plugged in they have transponders in them by law they're beginning
[2:45:44.080 --> 2:45:49.600]  to put in them where they're going to take over and make announcements yes and and they're promoting
[2:45:49.600 --> 2:45:54.880]  the free vaccines there's four public high schools so you're getting automated phone calls or are they
[2:45:54.880 --> 2:46:01.040]  having human beings call you no they are automated and they're calling cell phones too robot calls
[2:46:01.040 --> 2:46:06.960]  man yes and i i just it's it's really scary and the last thing i want to say and i'll let you go
[2:46:06.960 --> 2:46:13.440]  because i know you've got a lot of people to get to um they had a military helicopter land in um
[2:46:13.440 --> 2:46:18.160]  our local elementary schools playground um during school hours and made it part of an assembly
[2:46:18.160 --> 2:46:24.880]  we brought the kids out there they were armed um and it sounds reasonable but it's done to acclimate
[2:46:24.880 --> 2:46:32.400]  anderson high where i graduated in 1993 they had an army reserve general was the was the principal
[2:46:33.120 --> 2:46:39.040]  and then the year after i left roger rasler the younger brother of alex and nate rasler became
[2:46:39.040 --> 2:46:44.960]  a u2 football player good friend of mine he called me and said because i was already talking about
[2:46:44.960 --> 2:46:50.320]  the new world order by the time i was a freshman in college he said you wouldn't believe it alex
[2:46:50.880 --> 2:46:56.080]  they landed a helicopter and announced over the school and this happened my last day of school too
[2:46:56.080 --> 2:47:01.520]  or two days before they landed a cobra but they said they announced this is your new world order
[2:47:01.520 --> 2:47:05.920]  and they had marines takeover hobbs middle school pinzacola florida we have those articles
[2:47:06.720 --> 2:47:12.400]  1998 and then the marines took over the classrooms and said the president wants you to know what
[2:47:12.400 --> 2:47:21.760]  martial law is like in fact guys search engine info wars dot com helicopters anderson high
[2:47:22.640 --> 2:47:27.760]  black helicopter anderson high something like that you'll see photos that we posted
[2:47:28.480 --> 2:47:31.840]  because not only did roger rasler call me
[2:47:31.840 --> 2:47:43.600]  but then i got sent photos years later of it happening again i'm now remembering the whole
[2:47:43.600 --> 2:47:48.320]  story but uh thank you for the call i appreciate it uh lindsay williams your comment on the
[2:47:48.320 --> 2:47:53.680]  acclamation of the military taking over america the elitist talk with me about this i am so glad
[2:47:53.680 --> 2:47:58.560]  your caller brought this up they call it the devil's messiah now they have a word for it
[2:47:58.560 --> 2:48:02.400]  normally you probably wouldn't hear this it goes all the way back to what they've done
[2:48:02.400 --> 2:48:08.560]  to our schools it goes to the humanism that was brought in by evolution they have subverted
[2:48:08.560 --> 2:48:14.320]  the churches oh my goodness and my new dvd said i talk about what is done to the churches because
[2:48:14.320 --> 2:48:20.080]  i've been a pastor for 50 years or minister of the gospel so i go into that every bit of this
[2:48:20.080 --> 2:48:25.200]  is a part of what the latest talk with me about i think i dealt with part of this on your program
[2:48:25.200 --> 2:48:31.440]  last week so how far you'd like us to go um they did that this is their program
[2:48:34.400 --> 2:48:37.920]  we'll continue let's get to some more of the calls though that's important the total takeover
[2:48:37.920 --> 2:48:42.480]  of society through the schools and churches that's been declassified victor in california
[2:48:42.480 --> 2:48:50.160]  you're on the air with lindsay williams how you doing alex good alex yes i'm victor i'm a veteran
[2:48:50.160 --> 2:48:57.360]  from iraq and afghanistan i served in fort bragg and i was just looking over uh
[2:48:58.000 --> 2:49:07.360]  this on the internet it says the dome under the dome by steven king and it was an exclusive
[2:49:07.360 --> 2:49:17.680]  pop eater dot com interview with him and i was wondering like because i noticed that the simpsons
[2:49:17.680 --> 2:49:25.040]  had the dome on their cartoon and now this is coming out yes it's predictive programming
[2:49:25.040 --> 2:49:29.680]  where they condition you that you've got to go under quarantine they've got scores of tv shows
[2:49:29.680 --> 2:49:36.160]  about disaster martial law also you're comfortable with it and almost expect it like i keep hearing
[2:49:36.160 --> 2:49:41.040]  about this movie i want to go see it now so you're expecting it you're in you know it's kind of like
[2:49:41.040 --> 2:49:45.760]  when you're growing up in middle school and the bully is saying i'm going to be waiting for you
[2:49:45.760 --> 2:49:51.280]  when you get off the bus you almost are glad when you're pulling up in the bus and you see him waiting
[2:49:51.280 --> 2:49:57.040]  over in the edge of the woods you're almost glad to get it over with you're almost glad when he
[2:49:57.040 --> 2:50:01.840]  finally punches you because now you can get it going and that's the acclamation i pre and that
[2:50:01.840 --> 2:50:06.800]  lindsay talked about that the elite told him two weeks ago the same thing we're using movies to
[2:50:06.800 --> 2:50:14.240]  condition you lindsay yes they gave me a schedule of events in chronological order i'm still sitting
[2:50:14.240 --> 2:50:20.800]  back startled i think i gave those also in your program last week a schedule of events in chronological
[2:50:20.800 --> 2:50:29.440]  order of their countdown according to their new altered timeline of approximately two years
[2:50:29.440 --> 2:50:34.240]  and every bit of this is planned in advance and i think probably alex the only reason this gentleman
[2:50:34.240 --> 2:50:40.080]  gave me this is because he's over 85 years of age he almost died last winter once you become a part
[2:50:40.080 --> 2:50:45.440]  of the elite you never get away from and by the providence of god i've known this man now for
[2:50:45.440 --> 2:50:51.280]  about 30 years a number of times i've talked to him on the phone when he gave me this only days
[2:50:51.280 --> 2:50:57.840]  ago i was utterly appalled to know the entire plan of the elite put the next day there we're

[3:03:59.040 --> 3:04:05.280]  the other being canes and uh from one or two what our studies are here is that these two seed lines
[3:04:05.280 --> 3:04:11.120]  the cane seed line also known as the kenites these are the global elites controlling the four
[3:04:11.120 --> 3:04:16.640]  hidden dynasties the religion the political the financial and the educational systems and these
[3:04:16.640 --> 3:04:21.280]  are not these silly reptilian shape shifters that are talked about you know on other programs and
[3:04:21.280 --> 3:04:26.080]  stuff these this is a real group of people and all through the bible it talks about that they're
[3:04:26.080 --> 3:04:32.320]  builders of cities uh that they're the heads of states the kings the queens and uh they're using
[3:04:32.320 --> 3:04:38.960]  these tools the four hidden dynasties once again you know the political the religious the financial
[3:04:38.960 --> 3:04:45.440]  and uh the educational system to steer this planet into affairs and i suggest everybody out there is

[3:10:41.200 --> 3:10:46.800]  when this elite talked with me just a few days ago he was not talking about the antichrist when
[3:10:46.800 --> 3:10:52.800]  he'd mentioned the devil's messiah he was talking about a system a spirit of deception which they
[3:10:52.800 --> 3:11:00.800]  have used over the years to subvert our schools to bring in evolution to fool the pastors and to
[3:11:00.800 --> 3:11:06.240]  change our republic to a democracy and he went into these individuals as to how they have used
[3:11:06.240 --> 3:11:13.120]  this system to do that he was not dealing with the antichrist the person of being that uh some

[3:12:00.160 --> 3:12:06.160]  wake my past friends up uh but they're so bound in thinking that the only thing they can do
[3:12:06.880 --> 3:12:13.040]  is uh what they're presently doing and of course you have to understand that most of them are very
[3:12:13.040 --> 3:12:17.360]  happy with the paycheck they're getting uh i think if they lost it they'd probably be a lot better
[3:12:17.360 --> 3:12:25.840]  off but i i don't know how to wake him up i wish i could and i hope that alex dvd and the new one
[3:12:25.840 --> 3:12:34.000]  i've made i hope it'll wake up a lot of pastors i agree um i i just watched uh follow the book of
[3:12:34.000 --> 3:12:39.760]  the day and and i'm familiar with oath keepers and and we are changed i think that uh people need to
[3:12:39.760 --> 3:12:46.320]  figure out where they fit in and get in if you've ever pledged allegiance to any social
[3:12:48.320 --> 3:12:53.360]  position i would be a member of oath keepers as well as uh if if you're not even if you're like
[3:12:53.360 --> 3:12:58.000]  a college student or whatever i'd get involved with we are changed and also even to the you know
[3:12:58.000 --> 3:13:02.160]  a message to the elites or the people even involved with the elites you know these are people that
[3:13:02.160 --> 3:13:06.560]  are telling you to lie constantly at what point do you think that these people are not lying to you
[3:13:06.560 --> 3:13:14.720]  you know the reason the reason i know they're not lying to me is because for the past 35 years
[3:13:14.720 --> 3:13:19.680]  they've not told me this these two individuals and i've been the number of individuals i'm in
[3:13:19.680 --> 3:13:25.440]  touch with and these two individuals never in the past 35 years they've ever told me anything
[3:13:25.440 --> 3:13:29.920]  that didn't happen so therefore i take what they're saying today to be true especially when
[3:13:29.920 --> 3:13:35.280]  you're 85 years of age and facing the graveyard and you nearly died the last one though give this
[3:13:35.280 --> 3:13:39.840]  man credit for the fact that he's probably confessing everything absolutely let's go
[3:13:39.840 --> 3:13:43.760]  ahead and take another call robert and colorado you're on the air with lindsay williams
[3:13:44.560 --> 3:13:48.400]  hi it's great talking to both of you guys um i've got a quick little point before i get to
[3:13:48.400 --> 3:13:52.800]  my main point you were talking about all the propaganda that's uh pushing tap and trade
[3:13:52.800 --> 3:13:56.640]  when i was at the gas station the other day i actually saw something that was pretty interesting
[3:13:56.640 --> 3:14:03.120]  it was actually uh against it it was a gas station telling you how much more your gas prices will go
[3:14:03.120 --> 3:14:10.480]  up and i was in a locally owned austin gas station and they had a little red flyer uh against cap and
[3:14:10.480 --> 3:14:15.360]  trade and i said did i said did the dutch royal shell give this to you and they said no the owner
[3:14:15.360 --> 3:14:21.120]  did i mean i think that's really great for for businesses who are really kind of trying to
[3:14:21.120 --> 3:14:24.960]  inform people about what's happening it's kind of when uh cigarette taxes kind of same thing but
[3:14:24.960 --> 3:14:28.880]  my main point is is that uh you know as i've been listening to the show i've been getting more and
[3:14:28.880 --> 3:14:34.560]  more you know trying to organize um a small group of people in my local city we um it's called uh
[3:14:34.560 --> 3:14:40.320]  humans against insanity and we've got blogs and we're trying to do uh trying to do little stuff on
[3:14:40.320 --> 3:14:46.080]  our school but i ended up designing a poster for against the uh uh educating people for against
[3:14:46.080 --> 3:14:50.080]  the vaccines and uh and the swine food and everything like that i tried posting it around my
[3:14:50.080 --> 3:14:55.920]  school they've got a uh free speech zone we can post anything the posters were denied by the school
[3:14:55.920 --> 3:15:01.440]  to go on the main boards because because obviously they're for the uh the the healthy and vaccination
[3:15:01.440 --> 3:15:06.560]  and that's right how do you know something how do you know something is effective you know it's
[3:15:06.560 --> 3:15:11.040]  effective if the establishment doesn't want it up but i'm gonna i'm gonna let you go here's the deal
[3:15:11.040 --> 3:15:16.000]  i went to the first five or six callers that were on the board but now the callers need to be
[3:15:16.000 --> 3:15:22.640]  specifically for questions for lindsay williams i got him till 40 after and if you missed what he
[3:15:22.640 --> 3:15:26.480]  covered in the last three shows it's on his dvd we'll tell you how to get that before he leaves
[3:15:26.480 --> 3:15:35.120]  us but bottom line these are calls for lindsay williams now 1-800-259-9231 but uh great great
[3:15:35.120 --> 3:15:39.440]  job robert keep it up call me back on another day and tell me about it dan in wisconsin you're on
[3:15:39.440 --> 3:15:45.600]  the air go ahead yeah hi elix and uh lindsay thanks for what you're doing uh right to the point lindsay
[3:15:45.600 --> 3:15:51.440]  as a chaplain you probably know full well that in the book revelations it says that uh there is
[3:15:51.440 --> 3:15:55.360]  going to come about a global dictator and i'm wondering even though we're supposed to be fighting
[3:15:55.360 --> 3:16:01.360]  evil and i do fight these guys every day the best i can what can we do to actually stop all this
[3:16:01.360 --> 3:16:05.520]  because god said in the bible that it is going to happen there is going to come about a
[3:16:05.520 --> 3:16:11.600]  a global government and a global dictator and since that's already written i want to comment
[3:16:11.600 --> 3:16:17.440]  and then and then get lindsay's take look the government loves the doctrine in the churches
[3:16:17.440 --> 3:16:23.920]  of roman's 13 the founding fathers were bad lay down to your king george the third he is bestowed
[3:16:23.920 --> 3:16:29.360]  upon us by god it's a total distortion i've had pastor after pastor after pastor on the radio
[3:16:29.360 --> 3:16:37.520]  almost all the prophets jesus you name it were killed by the government because they didn't follow
[3:16:37.520 --> 3:16:42.640]  orders and because i mean the Pharisees were the were the religious leaders christ went in and whipped
[3:16:42.640 --> 3:16:50.800]  them with a whip and and and overturned their tables with the money changers now what we have
[3:16:50.800 --> 3:16:55.680]  here is let's say it's the end of the world five years from now i don't believe that but whatever
[3:16:55.680 --> 3:17:00.480]  let's say oh this is going to happen now it's my job to let people know this is the world
[3:17:00.480 --> 3:17:06.720]  government system so they can warn others that it's bad to not be part of it but instead christians
[3:17:06.720 --> 3:17:10.320]  think they're going to be teleported out of here they taught that in nazi germany they taught that
[3:17:10.320 --> 3:17:16.400]  in rwanda in 1993 and when they're not being telep you know uh teleported out of here they're
[3:17:16.400 --> 3:17:21.760]  really going to wonder what happened lindsay williams total misinterpretation of that scripture
[3:17:21.760 --> 3:17:27.440]  that you're talking about in roman's pastors take it and twist it to mean exactly what they
[3:17:27.440 --> 3:17:33.440]  think it means oh my goodness quick let me give you this lend on the seizure that which is ceasars
[3:17:33.440 --> 3:17:39.120]  ceasar was a dictator we don't have a king in the united states of america who is Caesar in the
[3:17:39.120 --> 3:17:45.680]  united states of america come on folks wake up i beg of you pastors the first three words of the
[3:17:45.680 --> 3:17:53.680]  constitution we the people we are a constitutional republic and in a constitutional republic you
[3:17:53.680 --> 3:18:00.960]  don't render anything onto a king the people of the of the they're the ruling force of the united
[3:18:00.960 --> 3:18:07.520]  states of america quick preaching this business of trying to be obedient to a bunch of godless
[3:18:07.520 --> 3:18:12.960]  presidents and congressmen that is not what the scriptures say well pastor going back to christ
[3:18:12.960 --> 3:18:18.640]  into paul and you're the expert on this so and regardless of people believe in god or not this
[3:18:18.640 --> 3:18:23.520]  is what's governing our systems so we should talk about it but they were trying to set christ up
[3:18:24.400 --> 3:18:31.760]  they were trying to set paul up saying should we pay taxes knowing he'd be killed if he said no
[3:18:31.760 --> 3:18:36.880]  and he said look the things that are gods or gods the things that are ceasar who's face on that it's
[3:18:36.880 --> 3:18:43.920]  ceasar it's his system but gods also says keep the commandments don't be part of evil why were
[3:18:43.920 --> 3:18:51.280]  the christians killed in roam in the first 300 years ad or common error because they were saying no
[3:18:51.280 --> 3:18:57.040]  to following what ceasar said what i mean these these churches are so devilish on their face pastor

[3:19:43.760 --> 3:19:52.000]  what the whole of the bible says but i mean look at moses he should have hit his knees to ramsees

[3:24:34.160 --> 3:24:43.360]  not able to pay for it another question if people that have gold and silver shares bonds or certificates

[3:24:50.640 --> 3:24:55.680]  a piece of paper is worth what it's written on it's nothing but a piece of paper this gentleman
[3:24:55.680 --> 3:25:01.120]  did a few days ago this really did talk with me about that i'm so glad you asked he said gold and
[3:25:01.120 --> 3:25:07.680]  silver all you can depend on he's talking about holding it in your hand they know that nothing
[3:25:07.680 --> 3:25:14.000]  has any value except what is in their hand or their pocket you need your own gold and silver in your
[3:25:14.000 --> 3:25:20.560]  hand a piece of paper again let me stress they do not trust it heaven reserve notes they laugh at it
[3:25:20.560 --> 3:25:26.080]  they don't use it they have nothing except that that they can hold original wealth comes from the
[3:25:26.080 --> 3:25:33.360]  land you need it in your hand piece of paper again is worth what it's written on alex absolutely
[3:25:34.400 --> 3:25:40.480]  that's a really good point let's continue and talk to brad in texas brad you're on the year
[3:25:41.280 --> 3:25:47.200]  hello alex and lindsay had a quick question you said that these people did have a religion
[3:25:49.280 --> 3:25:55.520]  what exactly religion is that and what is their code of ethics that you mentioned
[3:25:55.520 --> 3:26:02.960]  the other day the elite positively have a code of ethics they are not atheist but they worship a god
[3:26:02.960 --> 3:26:08.560]  but not the same god which is the god of the bible the prince of the power of this air is what they
[3:26:08.560 --> 3:26:15.360]  worship they worship the god of this world and when george bush said god bless you he was talking
[3:26:15.360 --> 3:26:21.280]  about skull and bones god he was not talking about the god who sent his son and their rituals
[3:26:21.280 --> 3:26:26.720]  have now been videotaped abc news had it it's satan worship they they bow and pledge allegiance
[3:26:26.720 --> 3:26:34.240]  to the prince of darkness on the male side and to the goddess eulogia on the other
[3:26:36.320 --> 3:26:45.040]  so yes this is true they they are uh they're satan that's true let's go ahead and take
[3:26:45.040 --> 3:26:51.920]  another call let's talk to trey in connecticut trey you're on the year uh hey alex hey lindsay
[3:26:51.920 --> 3:26:58.320]  how you guys doing today good speaking of skull and bones there you are yeah i'm right next door

[3:27:05.600 --> 3:27:11.680]  what's what's on your mind i came across an article that uh ended up catching my mind the other day
[3:27:11.680 --> 3:27:18.000]  um official disclosure of extraterrestrial life is imminent um yeah i see a lot of that from the
[3:27:18.000 --> 3:27:23.120]  disclosure project run by the rothschilds and others i don't we know there's a declassified
[3:27:23.120 --> 3:27:29.280]  program part of a declassified blue beam to have staged alien landings and i i just cover what i
[3:27:29.280 --> 3:27:36.160]  can prove we don't do the whole ufo thing we don't dislike people that do but the mainstream media
[3:27:36.160 --> 3:27:40.880]  tries to mix that in with the federal reserve being private or world government to discredit
[3:27:40.880 --> 3:27:48.400]  what we're doing uh but uh lindsay you want to comment on uh martians yes uh for three months
[3:27:48.400 --> 3:27:53.280]  time i didn't do a single radio talk show up until last week and the reason i didn't is because
[3:27:54.000 --> 3:28:00.320]  i say it exactly like alex alex just said unless i know what i'm talking about and i can prove it
[3:28:00.320 --> 3:28:06.480]  i'm not going to say it now when this man uh told me on the phone days ago what he did
[3:28:06.480 --> 3:28:10.560]  i'm spreading it everywhere across this nation from one side to the other every radio show
[3:28:10.560 --> 3:28:15.200]  i can get on everything i can possibly do because i know it's going to happen just

[3:33:33.600 --> 3:33:39.120]  continue with phone calls for our guests i'm going to move rapid fire now please direct
[3:33:39.120 --> 3:33:44.720]  your question at lindsay we're going to jump to the next person pat in oklahoma you're on the air pat
[3:33:44.720 --> 3:33:53.680]  pat hi um my question is for lindsay and um i guess my question is what is your comments
[3:33:53.680 --> 3:33:59.920]  like according to biblical prophecy if we are in the last days um this one world government is
[3:33:59.920 --> 3:34:07.120]  going to have to come about and do you think um maybe we're entering into a time of god's judgment
[3:34:07.120 --> 3:34:13.760]  on the nations well definitely it's coming about merely because it's biblical prophecy yet on the
[3:34:13.760 --> 3:34:18.400]  other hand there may be some places that don't suffer it quite as much as others and you'll
[3:34:18.400 --> 3:34:26.160]  have to understand that america has a biblical uh constitutional godly background and i believe
[3:34:26.160 --> 3:34:30.160]  the constitution is probably as close of a document as you'd find anywhere in the world
[3:34:30.160 --> 3:34:34.720]  to god given now the word of god is the most god given document on the face of this earth
[3:34:34.720 --> 3:34:42.080]  but the constitution definitely was inspired of the lord i would hope that america will not
[3:34:42.080 --> 3:34:48.480]  suffer as drastically as much of the rest of the world i must admit outright that in my bible study
[3:34:48.480 --> 3:34:57.840]  of 50 years and i'm in my 70s i cannot find america in the judgments now you hear my words
[3:34:57.840 --> 3:35:04.560]  i cannot find america in the judgments of the book of revelation maybe we don't suffer as much as
[3:35:04.560 --> 3:35:09.360]  the rest of the world because maybe we'll see a repentance before that time that's what i'm hoping
[3:35:09.360 --> 3:35:17.840]  for ma'am i appreciate your call let's talk to matt in california matt go ahead hi pastor lindsey
[3:35:17.840 --> 3:35:24.480]  hi alex hey hi matt hi i'm a former navy sub mariner and i'm now a seminary student and i just
[3:35:24.480 --> 3:35:28.720]  have a quick comment and a question for a guest um just a question or actually i'm gonna go to
[3:35:28.720 --> 3:35:33.920]  comment about jennison 315 i heard a caller calling in about it and i just wanted to i was sitting
[3:35:33.920 --> 3:35:37.360]  here doing my hebrus days and i just wanted people out there studying the old testament
[3:35:37.360 --> 3:35:42.400]  language you can do a lot of damage if you don't know the language is fluently and the the passage
[3:35:42.400 --> 3:35:46.960]  is talking about what theologians call the proto-evangelum and that's the first word of redemption
[3:35:47.760 --> 3:35:52.640]  in a gospel germ form about messiah christ that's what the seed is talking about in that passage
[3:35:52.640 --> 3:35:57.040]  and and that's how the original audience would have understood that passage but uh pastor lindsey
[3:35:57.040 --> 3:36:04.080]  have a question regarding the gentleman um that you uh that's been giving this information i just
[3:36:04.080 --> 3:36:09.680]  was curious as to his theological disposition whether he's uh atheist agnostic whether uh
[3:36:09.680 --> 3:36:14.400]  how many gods does he believe and what he believed about uh jesus christ uh how to get saved
[3:36:16.400 --> 3:36:22.800]  i am hoping from the latest conversation that we've had that probably the reason he's being
[3:36:22.800 --> 3:36:27.680]  honest with me and telling me many of these things is because i think something happened to him
[3:36:27.680 --> 3:36:34.720]  spiritually this past year now i'm hoping to get much more in depth into it but um i'm hoping for
[3:36:34.720 --> 3:36:43.200]  the best thank you all right thank you so much good to hear from you uh let's uh who's up next here
[3:36:45.360 --> 3:36:52.880]  pat in texas you're on the air go ahead hello um i have a well kind of a quick question for you both
[3:36:52.880 --> 3:36:59.760]  um i know everything is going on here and it's coming down to crunch time and all that
[3:37:00.480 --> 3:37:06.640]  but is this happening all over the world too because i've never heard anybody mention that
[3:37:08.960 --> 3:37:16.160]  that's pretty much my question lindsey yes uh the financial crisis the banking crisis
[3:37:16.720 --> 3:37:21.600]  iceland has declared bankruptcy a number of other countries now on the verge of bankruptcy
[3:37:21.600 --> 3:37:29.760]  yes this is worldwide in fact it is a it is a new world order and i think when you look in
[3:37:29.760 --> 3:37:35.520]  the scriptures you'll find the same thing it's global but i'm hoping and there again i just
[3:37:35.520 --> 3:37:41.680]  expressed what i said to the prayer prayer call it i am hoping that america is spared some of this
[3:37:41.680 --> 3:37:52.480]  because with our background we will see a turnaround godly and return okay um does that answer your
[3:37:52.480 --> 3:38:00.320]  question yes sir it does thank you thank you so much let's talk to mark and texas mark go ahead
[3:38:01.360 --> 3:38:06.640]  hey good afternoon alex and lindsey great stuff everybody needs to be hearing about and i'm
[3:38:06.640 --> 3:38:12.800]  glad to be on here and uh wanted to touch on a few things if that's okay sure go ahead you

[3:38:17.360 --> 3:38:23.440]  lindsey williams yeah definitely i have a question for him definitely ask your question please okay well
[3:38:23.440 --> 3:38:28.400]  it's more than a question um i i just wanted to give a refresher of what what i spoke with you
[3:38:28.400 --> 3:38:33.680]  once about alex which was um i mentioned this book that i got from research that has a bible
[3:38:33.680 --> 3:38:40.400]  verse in it um from luke 12 52 and it says that the lawyer says woe into them you know you hindered
[3:38:40.400 --> 3:38:44.240]  you took away the knowledge people you you enter not in your cells and you hinder those trying to
[3:38:44.240 --> 3:38:50.080]  enter again and and i and i you know it was a guy that exposed the probate lawyer system
[3:38:50.080 --> 3:38:54.800]  that they'll probate lawyer similar to all the things that these elites are doing taken away
[3:38:54.800 --> 3:39:01.680]  you know yeah the lawyers most of the time go and sell you out or but that's another subject
[3:39:01.680 --> 3:39:06.000]  i listen i appreciate your call but we don't have a lot of time left with lindsey and so we need
[3:39:06.000 --> 3:39:10.160]  questions addressed to lindsey not kind of pet projects and i'm not trying to be mean to you
[3:39:10.160 --> 3:39:14.960]  sir but we normally have totally wide open phones we don't screen your calls and when i say that we
[3:39:14.960 --> 3:39:19.440]  need questions for lindsey and that's why he's here that's what we're doing this for okay uh
[3:39:19.440 --> 3:39:24.080]  john in texas go ahead you're on the air with lindsey williams uh lindsey you keep talking
[3:39:24.080 --> 3:39:28.800]  about a timeline i'd like to know where we are in the timeline right now and where we're where
[3:39:28.800 --> 3:39:34.160]  where and when the next part is going to take place yes he did give me a timeline i'll give
[3:39:34.160 --> 3:39:39.280]  you just a few of the expressions very quickly within two years you will not recognize america
[3:39:39.280 --> 3:39:46.080]  again he said after two years you will be so poor you will not be able to rebel he went on to say
[3:39:46.080 --> 3:39:51.920]  that nellie everyone will be working for the government or the state within two years he
[3:39:51.920 --> 3:39:57.600]  kept repeating over and over and over their altered timeline of a two-year period and they
[3:39:57.600 --> 3:40:02.080]  have some definite plans now whether they will succeed in accomplishing it or not is another
[3:40:02.080 --> 3:40:09.600]  story i hope they don't but on the other hand that is their timeline okay well um what about the
[3:40:09.600 --> 3:40:13.680]  people who don't want to work for the government what's going to happen to them well there will be
[3:40:13.680 --> 3:40:19.520]  some mom and pop businesses that don't have mortgages that won't be taken over by all of this but
[3:40:19.520 --> 3:40:24.400]  keep in mind there was one other thing he told me too he said war is planned after two years
[3:40:24.400 --> 3:40:29.440]  now that is going to encompass so many new things that we never even thought off before
[3:40:29.440 --> 3:40:36.000]  because when war comes in and the whole world eventually gets involved you're talking a whole
[3:40:36.000 --> 3:40:42.480]  new ballgame here and let me add let me add i appreciate your call john but they're announcing
[3:40:42.480 --> 3:40:47.280]  the feds are taking over the internet for our safety and may shut it off during emergencies
[3:40:47.280 --> 3:40:51.680]  that's in my stack i'm about to cover they're announcing the government's taking over every
[3:40:51.680 --> 3:40:57.840]  facet of our lives and you may work for big corporation but it's going to rely on government
[3:40:57.840 --> 3:41:06.560]  contracts because the big fortune 500 they want government contracts to control everything
[3:41:06.560 --> 3:41:10.800]  because they control the government and the government will only give them the contracts
[3:41:11.600 --> 3:41:17.600]  it's these big corporations tying in with government and using that to perfect their
[3:41:17.600 --> 3:41:23.760]  tyranny but by speaking out against this we may be able to stop it let's jam in a few final calls
[3:41:23.760 --> 3:41:28.720]  virgil in oklahoma virgil you're on the air with lindsay williams all right quick but kissing
[3:41:28.720 --> 3:41:35.280]  to you alex great job on the uh fall of republic um mr williams can you elaborate on the devil's
[3:41:35.280 --> 3:41:40.240]  messiah or maybe point me to some research material where i could look at this up further
[3:41:40.240 --> 3:41:44.720]  well that's the term this elitist used for how they've taken over the churches and have the churches
[3:41:44.720 --> 3:41:51.600]  selling the people on tyranny the clergy response teams correct lindsay yeah you won't find that
[3:41:51.600 --> 3:41:56.400]  on the internet i mean if i had not been talking with this individual and if i had not known him
[3:41:56.400 --> 3:42:02.400]  for 35 years and spent hours and days with it personally at prude all day he would have never
[3:42:02.400 --> 3:42:07.120]  used this expression to me but then he went on to elaborate on how it includes everything from
[3:42:07.120 --> 3:42:12.480]  education to churches to the change of our country from a republic to a democracy and on and on and
[3:42:12.480 --> 3:42:19.120]  on it went and i try to explain it in detail in my dvds all right virgil thank you eric in california
[3:42:19.120 --> 3:42:31.280]  go that was explosive eric go ahead you're on the air yes go ahead um the question for you lindsay
[3:42:31.280 --> 3:42:35.120]  is that basically when you say that dollar is going to be dead does that mean that necessarily it's
[3:42:35.120 --> 3:42:40.960]  going to zero and if it's going to zero what is going to happen to all the revolving lines of credit
[3:42:40.960 --> 3:42:46.480]  well i don't believe that means they're going to slowly kill it and devalue it to monetize and pay
[3:42:46.480 --> 3:42:54.160]  off the fiat debt to themselves is that the intel you've got lindsay that's correct in fact remember
[3:42:54.160 --> 3:42:59.120]  you take a wheelbarrow load of dollars to the grocery store to buy a loaf of bread you will
[3:42:59.120 --> 3:43:07.200]  know the dollar's dead okay and that's going to happen in a few years uh he said he put it this
[3:43:07.200 --> 3:43:14.240]  way i'll read i'll give you his exact words he said uh by 2012 with approximately two years the
[3:43:14.240 --> 3:43:21.840]  dollar will be dead and he used the word dead all right thank you eric go ahead there it means it
[3:43:21.840 --> 3:43:27.200]  won't be the world currency you're still going to have dollars just like they have devalued pesos
[3:43:27.200 --> 3:43:33.360]  in mexico argentina it means the dollar will no longer be the world reserve currency and that's
[3:43:33.360 --> 3:43:38.080]  how we're buying all these cheap goods correct lindsay that is correct it will no longer be the
[3:43:38.080 --> 3:43:43.760]  reserve currency of the world in fact that was pretty much um brought to pass here a few weeks
[3:43:43.760 --> 3:43:49.120]  ago when opec said we're going to have a basket of currencies and you'll see this progressively
[3:43:49.120 --> 3:43:56.480]  over the next two years uh materialize in fact i've got a mainstream news article here's the
[3:43:56.480 --> 3:44:04.400]  new york post but it was all over the news two weeks ago dollar losses reverse dollar loses were
[3:44:05.040 --> 3:44:11.680]  reserve status to yen and euro dollar loses reserve status to yen and euro they've now gone
[3:44:11.680 --> 3:44:18.320]  more to buying yen uh euros and other currencies than they are the dollar so it's already begun
[3:44:18.320 --> 3:44:21.520]  sometimes i'll read a headline i can't seem to read it have one of those moments just now
[3:44:21.520 --> 3:44:28.000]  because i'm in a hurry uh i'm going to give each caller thirty seconds because i've got to go to
[3:44:28.000 --> 3:44:33.120]  a news blitz i promise to do it i'm discipling myself here to take calls and cover news and
[3:44:33.120 --> 3:44:37.360]  i'm trying to get better because that's what i think is a better radio show i could just settle
[3:44:37.360 --> 3:44:42.880]  into ranting for four hours but i want to give people a more diverse view very quickly omar in
[3:44:42.880 --> 3:44:48.160]  texas go hey how you doing there guys good go ahead we're sure the good work that you are
[3:44:48.160 --> 3:44:54.720]  and um lindy are doing hey just a quick comment um the information is of course is explosive as a
[3:44:54.720 --> 3:45:01.280]  blockbuster but lindy you made a comment earlier about there's nowhere in the bible um concerning

[3:56:38.000 --> 3:56:42.720]  the true death toll especially when they're about to increase troops is by claiming it was all air
[3:56:42.720 --> 3:56:48.960]  accidents uh morale dips for american marines in afghanistan and they're saying because the marines
[3:56:48.960 --> 3:56:54.240]  won't want the war to continue and want more troops oh if you support the troops keep them in

[3:57:32.800 --> 3:57:38.880]  but you see the government wants fraud they want the programs to be overwhelmed so the government
[3:57:38.880 --> 3:57:44.080]  borrows more money from the banks that just make it up out of nowhere but get interest in real assets

[3:58:16.960 --> 3:58:22.080]  and so they want to start taxing it just like prozac just like the lottery just like prostitution
