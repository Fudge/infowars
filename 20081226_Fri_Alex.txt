[00:24.640 --> 00:34.240]  and gentlemen welcome we've got the I don't know four or five million albums sold hip hop
[00:34.240 --> 00:45.240]  spoken word rap icon Paris joining us coming up on about an hour and a half from now in about 20
[00:45.240 --> 00:50.840]  minutes in studio we're gonna have Webster Griffin Tarpley who's down here with me for an interview
[00:50.840 --> 00:57.280]  for my new film about the economic collapse and Barack Obama being a puppet frontman and what
[00:57.280 --> 01:03.360]  we're going to see come from him and his betrayal of his supporters that we've already seen he's
[01:03.360 --> 01:08.600]  also going to be discussing in studio though particularly what his whole analysis on the
[01:08.600 --> 01:16.640]  Mumbai formerly Bombay attacks in the financial center of India and the clear false flag evidence
[01:16.640 --> 01:22.480]  there in so that is coming up at about 20 minutes with Webster Griffin Tarpley and then we have
[01:22.480 --> 01:30.040]  Jeffrey Smith the expert on GMO foods and crops and just the genocide against humanity and the
[01:30.040 --> 01:40.600]  planet earth that is going on dealing with that later in the last hour of the show today so the
[01:40.600 --> 01:48.960]  artist Paris running us from San Francisco in studio Webster Tarpley and Jeffrey Smith coming
[01:48.960 --> 01:56.720]  up on GMO the melamine and the milk all of it the deadly toxins and the plastics we of course
[01:56.720 --> 02:01.960]  have been talking about this for decades but scientists said don't use that type of plastic
[02:01.960 --> 02:08.920]  back in the 50s because it would sterilize not just mammals but amphibians reptiles and that's
[02:08.920 --> 02:14.280]  exactly why they put it in the plastic and then now it's finally breaking major news so we'll talk
[02:14.280 --> 02:18.400]  about it because what's old to us is new to the public public doesn't believe anything till the
[02:18.400 --> 02:24.640]  mainstream media finally has to admit it so we'll be discussing that coming up today trying to
[02:24.640 --> 02:28.520]  get people to consciously become aware of what's happening and myself included even though I know
[02:28.520 --> 02:35.360]  all this stuff I still slip up a lot and drink fluoridated water or eat and drink out of that
[02:35.360 --> 02:41.600]  type of plastic that's widely used I still eat some GMO food to my detriment and I'm really trying
[02:41.600 --> 02:47.080]  to focus myself and others I'm not using cell phones as much not having them around my children
[02:47.080 --> 02:54.480]  that's radiating your brain massive studies on that giving you brain tumors and a lot more so
[02:54.480 --> 03:04.480]  we'll be discussing that I'm gonna blitz through the news in the next segment the Rocky Mountain
[03:04.480 --> 03:11.560]  news is on the verge of going bankrupt if they're not sold they're saying 30 plus major papers
[03:11.560 --> 03:16.640]  including the Austin American States from where I live around for 150 something years it's on the
[03:16.640 --> 03:23.800]  verge of well-being sold and then financial trouble and this is a perfect storm of the
[03:23.800 --> 03:28.200]  mainstream media being discredited the internet most people getting their news from the web and
[03:28.200 --> 03:40.400]  not the horse and buggy pulp papers the wood pulp papers and it's also that the economy
[03:40.400 --> 03:46.320]  itself is is is imploding and so there's less ad revenue at a time when newspapers most of the
[03:46.320 --> 03:52.040]  morality hanging on by their fingernails on the cliff over the abyss of bankruptcy and
[03:52.040 --> 03:58.080]  extinction like the great dinosaurs you know I'm not really happy about the newspapers going
[03:58.080 --> 04:02.480]  bankrupt and being sold and being downsized everywhere because as bad as they are with
[04:02.480 --> 04:07.560]  corporate propaganda you still get some local news out of them and some of the multinational
[04:07.560 --> 04:14.120]  conglomerates are actually hailing all of this and cheerleading the fact praising the
[04:14.120 --> 04:19.800]  fact this is happening for further consolidation and vertical integration you've got about six
[04:19.800 --> 04:26.200]  families on over 90% of the newspapers in this country for conglomerates own over 90% of the
[04:26.200 --> 04:32.640]  TV cable and film production and you're only going to see a greater consolidation of that as
[04:32.640 --> 04:37.920]  well as the government comes in worldwide governments worldwide in unison restrict the
[04:37.920 --> 04:45.400]  first amendment on the web so don't hail the death of the newspapers because of the death of
[04:45.400 --> 04:51.800]  the net the free web is also ongoing it's already begun the websites are prison planet

[08:33.240 --> 08:38.600]  okay Paris joining us coming up at the bottom of the next hour Webster Tarpley in studio coming up
[08:38.600 --> 08:45.160]  in the next segment about the move by situation Obama and a lot more the Supreme Court is privately
[08:46.280 --> 08:51.160]  having a hearing amongst themselves today to decide on whether they are going to go forward
[08:51.800 --> 08:59.480]  with a court case dealing with Barack H Obama was he really born in Kenya or Hawaii as his mother
[08:59.480 --> 09:05.960]  claims why won't they release the original copy instead of a receipt of live birth so we're going
[09:05.960 --> 09:16.440]  to be watching that as it develops as well in the news today again as I mentioned will Supreme
[09:16.440 --> 09:21.880]  Court take on Obama's citizenship the US Supreme Court will consider today whether to take up a
[09:21.880 --> 09:28.120]  lawsuit challenging President elect Barack Obama's US citizenship and continuation of a New Jersey
[09:28.120 --> 09:35.400]  case embraced by some opponents of Obama's election the meeting of justices will coincide with a
[09:35.400 --> 09:42.120]  vigil by the filer supporters in Washington on the steps of the nation's highest court the suit
[09:42.120 --> 09:48.840]  originally sought to stay the election and was filed on behalf of Leo Donfrio against New Jersey
[09:48.840 --> 09:53.320]  Secretary of State Nina Michael Wells legal experts say the appeal has little chance of
[09:53.320 --> 09:57.640]  succeeding despite appearing on the court schedule legal record show it is only the tip of the
[09:57.640 --> 10:01.640]  iceberg of nationwide effort seeking to derail Obama's election over accusations that he has
[10:01.640 --> 10:07.160]  neither was born in the US citizen or that he later renounced his citizenship in Indonesia I
[10:07.160 --> 10:12.280]  personally think this is going nowhere the establishment is fully behind Obama both the
[10:12.280 --> 10:17.560]  Democratic and Republican parties and but we will certainly see what happens there
[10:17.560 --> 10:29.960]  golf oil CEO says gas could hit $1 a gallon by next year golf oil CEO Joe Petrosky said on
[10:29.960 --> 10:34.760]  Wednesday that the price of oil could sink to $20 per barrel and there was a chance gasoline
[10:34.760 --> 10:41.640]  prices could drop as low as $1 per gallon by early next year speaking at the South Shore
[10:41.640 --> 10:49.320]  Chamber of Commerce breakfast the Brockton native said that after speculators drove oil prices up
[10:49.320 --> 10:53.960]  there's a chance that the market will overshoot on the way back down resulting in much lower
[10:53.960 --> 11:00.600]  prices at the pump only about 30% of oil price increases up to $150 a barrel five months ago
[11:00.600 --> 11:05.160]  six months ago was speculation the rest was dollar devaluation there has been a global
[11:05.160 --> 11:12.920]  global currency devaluation in the last six months not just the dollar being devalued but
[11:12.920 --> 11:18.760]  all major currencies were devalued the IMF and World Bank a haunt showed that and so you've had
[11:18.760 --> 11:25.720]  all currencies dropping that's why it's appeared that the dollar has stayed its freefall in reality
[11:25.720 --> 11:32.600]  again they are all dropping Milwaukee neighborhoods could print their own money the Chicago Tribune
[11:32.600 --> 11:36.920]  reports two neighborhoods consider printing own currency for exclusive use in local stores
[11:38.760 --> 11:42.920]  and it goes into the fact that the barter system is now being looked at residents from
[11:42.920 --> 11:48.120]  a walking neighborhoods on river west and east side are scheduling to meet to discuss printing
[11:48.120 --> 11:52.520]  their own money the idea is that the local cash could be used in neighborhood stores and businesses
[11:52.520 --> 11:57.320]  thus encouraging local spending the result supporters hope would be a bustling local economy
[11:57.320 --> 12:01.400]  even as the rest of the nation deals with recession i think that's beautiful and the feds can't
[12:01.400 --> 12:07.080]  stop that if neighborhoods and then towns and then cities and then regions and states
[12:07.080 --> 12:11.800]  but again doing this this was uh very popular in europe still popular in some areas of europe
[12:11.800 --> 12:17.000]  very popular in this nation's founding and before its founding and has been basically
[12:17.000 --> 12:23.640]  extincted by the foreign banking cartel the money changers a really important news canadian prime
[12:23.640 --> 12:32.200]  minister wins suspension of parliament this is out of Reuters today it's up on info wars.com
[12:32.200 --> 12:36.520]  prisonplanet.com we have a link to it if you want to find it and buried in the article
[12:37.560 --> 12:42.680]  is the key every time i get up on air and say that australia canada
[12:44.280 --> 12:52.360]  scotland and 20 plus other commonwealth nations are owned and run by the queen canadians australians
[12:52.360 --> 12:56.680]  send me emails and laugh at me or go on the message board at prisonplanet.com and say i'm a liar
[12:57.960 --> 13:03.080]  because they don't even know how their own form of government works your parliaments are ceremonial
[13:04.600 --> 13:15.800]  and anytime the witch wants to suspend the parliament she can do that and i've studied
[13:15.800 --> 13:23.800]  the british government now in 1215 that for a while there was of course some liberty by the
[13:23.800 --> 13:33.320]  middle class and a a a balancing towards freedom and in the last 400 years there were some periods
[13:33.320 --> 13:39.080]  where the parliament in england did have the power those were times when they seized the king and
[13:39.080 --> 13:46.280]  chopped his head off and happened several times or imprisoned the king or queen but in the last
[13:46.280 --> 13:57.960]  200 years the the monarchy has been in full control and the queen owns most the oil most the timber
[13:57.960 --> 14:02.840]  most the gold most the diamonds and the natural resources of course this is all done illegally
[14:02.840 --> 14:08.280]  through fraud but they they love to advertise that they have no power that they're a bunch of
[14:08.280 --> 14:15.960]  boobies uh you know a bunch of maroons who can't get anything done and have to have their noses
[14:15.960 --> 14:26.120]  wiped for them but if you read this article the parliament was moving to remove
[14:29.240 --> 14:36.680]  steven harper the canadian prime minister and the queen stepped in because she likes what he's
[14:36.680 --> 14:44.680]  doing and has frozen the parliament and if you read the legalese it has been dissolved now she may
[14:44.680 --> 14:50.600]  reconfigure the parliament and i would challenge canadians that aren't aware of how their government
[14:50.600 --> 14:58.040]  works everyone serves at the queen's pleasure if the ceremonial parliament does what she wants
[14:59.080 --> 15:04.840]  then she stands down she's not just on your money there's not just crowns and all your highway signs
[15:04.840 --> 15:08.200]  when you're over in england no matter where you're at in england routinely in every major
[15:08.200 --> 15:13.160]  town they will just shut down large parts of the city roads and tell you that it is the queen's
[15:13.160 --> 15:19.560]  pleasure if she wants to boat up and down the the tames she will shut it down and make thousands
[15:19.560 --> 15:24.760]  of international ships and millions of dollars free sometimes for weeks she does what she wants
[15:24.760 --> 15:30.040]  when she wants last time i was in england uh they shut down large parts of the city and they would
[15:30.040 --> 15:35.400]  announce on uh you know loudspeakers and on the turbuses that her majesty has chosen to shut down
[15:35.400 --> 15:43.000]  part of the city today that is part of an exercise of power you know the queen doesn't want billboards
[15:43.000 --> 15:48.440]  up nationwide in england so they're not so there are no billboards outside the cities it's all about
[15:48.440 --> 15:54.440]  an exercise of power but this is not advertised it's not put out in the media very often but
[15:54.440 --> 16:01.160]  on the ground floor they let everybody know the entire british parliament is spied on
[16:01.880 --> 16:09.000]  by the illegitimate mi5 mi6 that serves under the direction of her majesty
[16:11.240 --> 16:16.280]  and that's why the queen through the executive powers that are again totally illegitimate hitler
[16:16.280 --> 16:20.840]  had total power but was illegitimate has been ordering government ministers arrested under
[16:20.840 --> 16:26.280]  terrorism charges for exposing government corruption so so we're seeing tyranny not just in england
[16:26.280 --> 16:30.920]  but in the united states and worldwide here in the united states the president the executive acts as
[16:30.920 --> 16:35.400]  a king now and you're hearing them say the governors are now federal officers serving at the pleasure
[16:35.400 --> 16:39.560]  of the president they can put troops tens of thousands on the streets they are going to do it
[16:40.280 --> 16:42.600]  but but here is roiders for those that are ignorant
[16:42.600 --> 16:50.360]  but canadian prime minister wins suspension of parliament suspension of parliament
[16:52.200 --> 16:55.800]  and she can expel it as well canadian prime ministers even harbour want a rare
[16:55.800 --> 17:00.600]  suspension of parliament on thursday managing to avoid being ousted by opposition party anger
[17:00.600 --> 17:04.760]  over the minority conservative government's economic plans and an attempt to cut off party
[17:04.760 --> 17:12.200]  financing governor general michelle gene governor general now that's the we're under a governor
[17:12.200 --> 17:17.720]  general under north com that serves at the discretion of the executive same thing that's
[17:17.720 --> 17:22.040]  and i keep telling canadians and others it's that your governor generals you're in a common
[17:22.040 --> 17:30.600]  wealth just like we have the 1776 war here that started in 1775 when the governor general came
[17:30.600 --> 17:35.720]  in and started removing governors appointing puppet governors removing legislatures putting in
[17:35.720 --> 17:41.720]  puppet legislatures removing judges and magistrates putting in puppets this is how imperial rule works
[17:41.720 --> 17:46.280]  face where you live face what you're under and then you can take your country's back
[17:46.840 --> 17:52.840]  but as long as you continue to live in denial we can't change anything roiders
[17:54.040 --> 17:59.320]  governor general michelle gene representative queen elizabeth canada's head of state see queen
[17:59.320 --> 18:05.560]  elizabeth canada's head of state he didn't harper agreed to harper's request to shut down parliament
[18:05.560 --> 18:12.840]  until january 26 parliament was reconvened just weeks ago of the october 14 election harper's
[18:12.840 --> 18:16.600]  request for suspension was unprecedented no prime minister had asked for parliament to be
[18:16.600 --> 18:21.240]  suspended to avoid a confidence vote in the house of commons let's see that power is always there
[18:21.240 --> 18:26.760]  if the little puppets don't don't don't do what they're told if the ceremonial legislatures and
[18:26.760 --> 18:33.800]  parliaments in congress what happened seven weeks ago congress did a no vote on giving the bankers
[18:33.800 --> 18:38.360]  unlimited total power to steal all the money they want with no review that was in there we read the
[18:38.360 --> 18:45.320]  bill and so the banker representative of the private bank of england via the federal reserve
[18:45.320 --> 18:50.360]  of local governorship the governor general of the banking elite Bernacke went in there with his puppet

[19:11.080 --> 19:16.040]  marshal law the government is illegitimate but they want to fool people with oh we got a brown

[24:19.800 --> 24:22.760]  well no more than an hour we're going to have webster tarply in
[24:23.720 --> 24:28.360]  studio with us and we're going to be talking about what really happened with the mu bi attacks all
[24:28.360 --> 24:32.680]  the evidence of false flag there with western intelligence trying to get the two nations
[24:32.680 --> 24:37.560]  fighting with each other and talk about the rock h obama and what his presidency is really going
[24:37.560 --> 24:42.680]  to mean to this nation also with the supreme court meeting today to consider further hearings
[24:43.560 --> 24:49.640]  on checking his us citizenship and demanding his original birth certificate will talk about that
[24:49.640 --> 24:55.000]  as well webster tarply in studio but he was listening out in the green room during the break
[24:55.000 --> 24:59.400]  when i was covering canadian prime minister win suspension of parliament and we just went live
[24:59.400 --> 25:04.760]  at prison planet dot tv so i'll recap that for the viewers out there canadian prime minister
[25:04.760 --> 25:08.680]  win suspension of parliament and it says governor general michelle gene the representative of the
[25:08.680 --> 25:14.360]  queen elizabeth canada's head of state agreed to harper's request to shut down parliament
[25:14.360 --> 25:19.080]  until january 26 parliament was reconvened just weeks ago after october 14th election
[25:19.080 --> 25:23.800]  now he lost control the government became the minority party but was refusing to allow elections
[25:23.800 --> 25:30.040]  within parliament to have a new prime minister seated that's how parliamentary systems work
[25:30.840 --> 25:35.240]  our country was much more similar to this until 1913 with the 17th amendment when states
[25:36.360 --> 25:42.840]  legislators stopped appointing senators that was their trump with states rights over total
[25:42.840 --> 25:48.120]  federalism but but this is imperium here because she is the head of state and canadians and
[25:48.120 --> 25:53.160]  australians and others in the 20 plus commonwealth nations always say oh well that's just figurative
[25:53.160 --> 25:57.720]  that's just ceremonial her as the head of state no no no if you read the charters of these common
[25:57.720 --> 26:04.360]  wells it is the parliaments that are ceremonial uh and it is the queen's governorship or through
[26:04.360 --> 26:09.400]  her governors uh there's actually the power so there it is in reuters and every time i
[26:10.040 --> 26:15.000]  mention these reports people just don't believe me and webster tarpleys written books on the
[26:15.000 --> 26:18.840]  british imperium written many articles on it in its form of government so in the time we have left
[26:18.840 --> 26:23.400]  in this limited segment webster i would love to uh well first off welcome you to the studio but then
[26:23.400 --> 26:28.840]  also give you a chance you bet give you a chance to break down the article thank you very much
[26:28.840 --> 26:33.240]  alex thank you thank you for inviting me it's wonderful to be here and congratulations to
[26:33.240 --> 26:37.400]  you for everything that you're doing uh this is the first i've heard of this they were supposed
[26:37.400 --> 26:43.560]  to be a vote of no confidence against harper by the by the parliament now remember under the uh
[26:43.560 --> 26:49.000]  canadian and indeed british commonwealth system the queen is the head of state of all of these
[26:49.000 --> 26:56.040]  places and it's about 70 countries it's a huge group and in the case of uh canada and australia
[26:56.040 --> 27:00.600]  we have these royal governors general and the royal governor general is the guy who's just
[27:00.600 --> 27:08.520]  done this this guy uh governor general michelle john so he's the personal representative of the queen
[27:08.520 --> 27:13.800]  and you can see that he has more power than the parliament and the uh and the prime minister meaning
[27:13.800 --> 27:21.240]  that we had this this agitation in canada in the 1960s and 70s saying that the the constitution had
[27:21.240 --> 27:27.480]  to be repatriated right they wanted to bring the constitution home to canada and uh it turns out that
[27:27.480 --> 27:32.440]  was not done uh i would say for people who have trouble with this concept there are two two examples
[27:32.440 --> 27:37.160]  you can see that the queen actually runs the show one is in the canadian nafta debate in other
[27:37.160 --> 27:43.720]  words to get the north american free trade agreement passed the queen named new senators to the canadian
[27:43.720 --> 27:48.600]  senate to to stack it right to pack it to make sure that there was that's right they're supposedly
[27:48.600 --> 27:53.480]  going to be elected but as soon as they didn't know the way she wanted she came in packed it
[27:53.480 --> 27:58.680]  yeah right and then the other one is maybe even more spectacular in australia gow whitlam uh about
[27:58.680 --> 28:03.960]  1975 was the prime minister of australia and he said look there's an oil crisis i'm going to make
[28:03.960 --> 28:09.080]  direct deals with arab oil producers oil for technology australia will produce technology
[28:09.080 --> 28:14.040]  for them we'll get our oil guaranteed and london new york said no and at that point the governor
[28:14.040 --> 28:19.160]  general of australia intervened to overthrow whitlam and impose malcolm frazier and it was a
[28:19.160 --> 28:24.680]  complicated thing because the the australian parliament immediately voted no confidence in
[28:24.680 --> 28:30.040]  the new puppet or a frazier and tried to get whitlam back and there was a period of about six months
[28:30.040 --> 28:35.480]  of of uh tremendous chaos who won that fight uh the queen again because see what the queen
[28:35.480 --> 28:40.280]  represented the queen is not she's not somebody like starlin and but she doesn't have all power but
[28:40.280 --> 28:45.960]  she represents the oligarchy as a whole in the word she's the spokesperson she's the doge if you
[28:45.960 --> 28:51.000]  like the dogeressa but she does have starlin s she just doesn't want to use the power because then
[28:51.000 --> 28:56.120]  that reveals that um these parliaments are really ceremonial but they're still dangerous within the
[28:56.120 --> 29:01.560]  ceremonial parliaments because they truly have been voted in so they hold the true organic
[29:01.560 --> 29:08.440]  rightful power and then could rally the people with their bully pulpit to throw out the oligarchy
[29:08.440 --> 29:12.440]  right and the question of rallying the people is the absolutely critical thing because if you
[29:12.440 --> 29:16.040]  don't rally the people then the oligarchs are going to run wild and we see that they're running
[29:16.040 --> 29:22.600]  wild it also shows that that the entire anglo-american world is now descending into a form of chaos
[29:22.600 --> 29:27.720]  emergency rule because they're having to now take the veil off the velvet glove off the iron
[29:27.720 --> 29:32.360]  fist and really show people the true machinery just like here in the u.s. they're announcing
[29:32.360 --> 29:36.360]  yes we're going to use regular army against the people yes the governors are now puppets
[29:36.360 --> 29:40.440]  of the president yes you're living under marshal law they're throwing the gauntlet down webster
[29:40.440 --> 29:44.920]  target let's finish up with this uh riveting information let me get back and then i get
[29:44.920 --> 29:48.200]  into a lot more state with us ladies and gentlemen more straight ahead

[33:29.800 --> 33:36.520]  state her governor generals control the bureaucracy they control the intelligence agencies they push
[33:36.520 --> 33:41.640]  through all of the attacks on the internet free speech in canada it is the governor general if
[33:41.640 --> 33:45.960]  you read deeply into the last six months they're saying we're only gonna let you have a few thousand
[33:45.960 --> 33:51.640]  websites you can visit they've all got to be certified we're talking chinese communist level
[33:51.640 --> 33:58.040]  censorship or even greater china allows millions of sites to be visited and restricts millions
[33:58.040 --> 34:02.280]  canada's talking about just a few thousand and it's not being done even by law they're the
[34:02.280 --> 34:07.160]  regulators because again the governor general controls the commerce and the parliament doesn't
[34:07.160 --> 34:11.880]  do what they want they just remove them as they've just done they suspend them or expel them and that
[34:11.880 --> 34:16.680]  will be the next move if they don't play ball as they as you talked about them winning a fight
[34:16.680 --> 34:22.520]  decades ago in australia similarly and so that's why you see australia announcing what two weeks
[34:22.520 --> 34:27.400]  ago that they are going to only have a few thousand websites that you can visit headlines you know
[34:27.400 --> 34:33.400]  web to have chinese style censorship in australia google that in hundreds of headlines and the news
[34:33.400 --> 34:38.760]  was saying this is good because obviously they're the mainstream media they also want to team up
[34:38.760 --> 34:43.960]  like for like with the establishment to restrict the burgeoning exploding alternative media now
[34:43.960 --> 34:47.640]  here in the united states as webster was just saying they're trying to bring in a similar
[34:47.640 --> 34:53.800]  system of total executive power dictatorial power over the states over the congress threatening them
[34:53.800 --> 35:00.440]  with martial law north com trips on the streets the question is uh from the onset of this nation
[35:00.440 --> 35:07.160]  in 1776 that was a rebellion as i said earlier against the very same sex coberg gothers the very
[35:07.160 --> 35:13.960]  same german family that had just been in for two generations by then in england uh you know king
[35:13.960 --> 35:20.280]  george the third removing governors removing legislators appointing governor generals bringing
[35:20.280 --> 35:26.760]  back in uh this type of system and we had a war over it because the british soldiers were coming
[35:26.760 --> 35:33.480]  to then disarm the people and to put troops on the streets of the 13 colonies so same families
[35:33.480 --> 35:39.640]  same players same nations same groups those that don't know history are doomed to repeat it and
[35:39.640 --> 35:45.160]  that's why it's so important to study history and now in canada she just says you know what
[35:45.160 --> 35:49.160]  parliament you're no longer in authority i'm keeping steven harper and power because he's
[35:49.160 --> 35:54.840]  han showing the north american union he's han showing uh letting the banks loot canada and changing
[35:54.840 --> 35:59.240]  the rules he is going along with all that and webster tarpoli is just an amazing historian
[35:59.240 --> 36:04.440]  and written papers and books on the subject so so webster uh i i want to get into move by but but
[36:04.440 --> 36:10.760]  let's get back into this and flesh it all out because this is so so vitally important well i
[36:10.760 --> 36:15.800]  would say the the only adequate answer to what the queen and her governor general have done would
[36:15.800 --> 36:20.840]  be a nationwide open ended general strike saying bring the parliament back together and let them vote
[36:20.840 --> 36:25.880]  and we don't accept dictation from from london or any place else but as soon as you say that you
[36:25.880 --> 36:31.720]  see the predicament of the anglo-american world in none of these countries do we have um organizations
[36:31.720 --> 36:36.120]  that would be interested in mass struggle or even capable of conducting a mass struggle and that's
[36:36.120 --> 36:40.600]  due to the propaganda through the media well it's due to the atomization i mean political parties
[36:40.600 --> 36:45.240]  used to exist they're largely gone they largely exist on television they don't have organization
[36:45.240 --> 36:50.200]  it's infiltration it's infiltration of the labor unions the media everything has been has been
[36:50.200 --> 36:56.920]  commandeered right but that's the the the question now for all of us is uh we we've got to find ways
[36:56.920 --> 37:02.120]  to create new institutions and that means institutions i mean it means ultimately the end
[37:02.120 --> 37:06.440]  of this you know offices in cities right if you had a if you had an organization with
[37:06.440 --> 37:12.360]  offices in 500 or a thousand american cities let's say you could mount a protest against the things
[37:12.360 --> 37:18.200]  that obama is going to be doing i mean we've got to look ahead now to this period of the 20th of
[37:18.200 --> 37:22.920]  january the inauguration till about may 1st okay i want to do that the hundred days to
[37:22.920 --> 37:28.840]  but i want to put bookends on the discussion of the shadow government roundtable group
[37:28.840 --> 37:34.360]  governor general uh uh uh maritime or administrative law system that the british
[37:34.360 --> 37:40.600]  imperium uh the anglo-american establishment is using finish up breaking down how this shadow
[37:40.600 --> 37:45.240]  government operates on the commonwealth's how they're trying through executive set one up
[37:45.240 --> 37:50.760]  here and across europe again and and and finish up because that's key how they're doing this
[37:50.760 --> 37:56.280]  because they're under attack they're losing their power uh you know they have uh uh you've
[37:56.280 --> 38:00.920]  gotten into a crisis and and then let's get into move by and then into obama just in in
[38:00.920 --> 38:05.320]  terms of the british system the british system is a copy of the venetian system the the british
[38:05.320 --> 38:11.480]  monarch is the doge or in this case the female doge of the entire oligarchy and this was copied
[38:11.480 --> 38:15.800]  the the french model of a monarchy is a little bit different like something like louis louis the
[38:15.800 --> 38:21.880]  14th that's absolutism and that's that's a step beyond although that also has positive features
[38:21.880 --> 38:26.120]  that that's divine right of kings yeah pretty much and that was tried in england that was
[38:26.120 --> 38:30.520]  tried by uh by james the first and charles the first and as you mentioned before charles the first
[38:30.520 --> 38:37.720]  got his head cut off back in about 1640 and since then you've had these things the rise of the
[38:37.720 --> 38:44.440]  wig party the the english wig party of the great nobility who are about equal to the king and
[38:44.440 --> 38:51.160]  the king or the monarch becomes a spokesperson for that group so the british model is the monarch
[38:51.160 --> 38:56.440]  expresses the collective will of the oligarchy now there have been time they only seeded power
[38:56.440 --> 39:02.200]  because of 1215 and then other struggles in 1640 when they found that the middle class the upper
[39:02.200 --> 39:08.520]  middle class the gentry uh continue to overthrow the monarchy so the two inner bread and combined
[39:08.520 --> 39:14.120]  forces yeah well the outcome of all that process and it's a complicated one is that that by uh well
[39:14.120 --> 39:19.720]  by 1688 right by the so-called glorious revolution you have the oligarchy in england putting in
[39:20.280 --> 39:25.560]  william of orange right william and mary and that's a that's a venetian doge system where the
[39:25.560 --> 39:30.120]  oligarchy picks the king gets rid of one king right gets rid of james the second brings in
[39:30.120 --> 39:37.240]  uh william and mary and from about 1688 to 1832 you've got this perfect oligarchy and it's gotten
[39:37.240 --> 39:41.400]  you know they've had some rocky time since the the one example that you want to point to king
[39:41.400 --> 39:48.200]  edward the seventh is an example of somebody who really did uh combine in himself this kind of uh
[39:48.200 --> 39:52.840]  power because he had been the prince of wales under queen victoria so that meant he had about
[39:52.840 --> 39:58.280]  50 or 60 years where the mother was the queen he called he called her my eternal mother
[39:58.280 --> 40:03.880]  her she never she never decided to leave the scene so the prince of wales edward the seventh
[40:04.440 --> 40:08.920]  created this unparalleled network and he created the alliance system that brought on world war
[40:08.920 --> 40:14.840]  one in other words if you wanted to say one person who did most to cause world war one
[40:14.840 --> 40:20.440]  that would be king edward the seventh because he created this triple entente right to crush
[40:20.440 --> 40:25.480]  germany between russia france and the british and even he detached italy from the uh
[40:25.480 --> 40:32.280]  from the german austrian coalition so this is very
[40:55.480 --> 41:13.640]  very evil institution and it with the with the british monarchy you're getting very close to the
[41:14.200 --> 41:18.360]  to the to bring him in and also become king of king of england he was brought in out of germany
[41:18.360 --> 41:22.680]  and then go against uh louis the 14th here's a question and i've studied this quite a bit but
[41:22.680 --> 41:26.840]  you probably know more obviously uh was it just there have been so much interbreeding with the
[41:26.840 --> 41:31.800]  original normans and the french and others that the british line uh were having trouble
[41:31.800 --> 41:35.560]  having children is that why because they had all those little states in germany how did
[41:35.560 --> 41:40.520]  the german royal line which hadn't been dominant previously end up populating all the major royal
[41:40.520 --> 41:47.240]  thrones uh by 1750 well i i would say maybe a little bit later and a lot of these people are the
[41:47.240 --> 41:53.000]  the um well the germans were controlled by 1700 the nieces and nephews of of queen victoria
[41:53.000 --> 41:57.640]  that that's again edward the seventh was known as the uncle of europe because all of the uh
[41:58.360 --> 42:03.720]  the you know the czar of russia was his nephew the german kaiser was his nephew the austrian
[42:03.720 --> 42:08.680]  they had blood there yeah but the the big thing is that queen queen victoria had a lot of children
[42:08.680 --> 42:13.560]  and the intermarriage they are meant that you you have a kind of a merger of many or most of the
[42:13.560 --> 42:18.360]  european royal houses with the british one because the british of course had the you know they had
[42:18.360 --> 42:23.960]  naval supremacy they had financial supremacy they had sure kind of a pecking order supremacy i mean
[42:23.960 --> 42:29.480]  the kaiser willhelm poor guy emperor william the second of germany was obsessed with the idea
[42:29.480 --> 42:34.920]  that edward the seventh of england was you know much more prestigious and much more uh you know he
[42:34.920 --> 42:40.840]  had much greater rank in the world all the gaukical you know universe than than he did so uh it's
[42:40.840 --> 42:46.440]  basically a united thing and that and that's what you see uh today but again what she's what the queen
[42:46.440 --> 42:51.880]  is representing here is the decision that you know comes from the city of london it comes from the
[42:51.880 --> 42:56.120]  toronto financial district it comes really from wall speed too because there are a lot of people
[42:56.120 --> 43:02.120]  there who are sort of dual you know loyalty people are looking to the to the british as the as the
[43:02.120 --> 43:07.000]  homeland also noticed that the 700 billion dollar bailout that we fought against and tried you know
[43:07.000 --> 43:12.760]  to stop and there was which is now 8.4 trillion right right uh that was a british model bailout
[43:12.760 --> 43:17.160]  and it was the the whole idea from that came from gordon brown allister darlin they had met
[43:17.160 --> 43:21.560]  that that he's marvin king right he was he was the big inspiration of that now we've got a funny
[43:21.560 --> 43:27.880]  situation if you look at city bank city bank got 25 billion i think under the first round of the
[43:27.880 --> 43:33.480]  bailout the gordon brown british model bailout and began to go bankrupt the second time right so
[43:33.480 --> 43:38.520]  now city bank had to get a second bailout this one was done under the swiss model this was done
[43:38.520 --> 43:43.560]  under the bad bank model where you create this separate bank and put all the toxic derivatives
[43:43.560 --> 43:47.400]  into that one and throw it overboard and now they're going to go bankrupt again so what do you do
[43:47.400 --> 43:52.440]  when they go bankrupt for the third time you've tried the british model it failed you try the
[43:52.440 --> 43:58.600]  swiss model i think it's clear the city bank is a candidate for chapter 11 uh reorganization
[43:58.600 --> 44:02.680]  and wipe out the derivatives let me digress then we'll get more into the bailout the banker take
[44:02.680 --> 44:06.360]  over and then and then move into move by because i want to spend time on them then obama coming up
[44:06.360 --> 44:11.480]  the next hour uh isn't it extremely dangerous i mean they don't do this a lot to have the queen
[44:11.480 --> 44:16.520]  go ahead and come right out in the open and and basically a show canadians and the world
[44:16.520 --> 44:22.200]  that these are commonwealth are really governed by the shadow government and and that their
[44:22.200 --> 44:29.480]  parliaments do serve uh uh basically at the pleasure and a ceremonial uh uh legates it's
[44:29.480 --> 44:33.960]  dangerous and i think the question there was who's going to do something about it now you have uh
[44:33.960 --> 44:38.680]  this left-wing thing called the new democratic party are they going to do anything how about
[44:38.680 --> 44:43.480]  it new democrats are you going to fight for for some notion of rule of law that's the question
[44:43.480 --> 44:48.200]  why are they what why is the queen and harp we're going after the liberals i think it's a
[44:48.200 --> 44:52.120]  combination of two things it's on the one side the idea that they think that nobody will fight
[44:52.120 --> 44:57.080]  is there a canadian trade union federation of their the québécois how about the québécois
[44:57.080 --> 45:01.400]  how about the will the canadian media will the canadian media tell people what this is what
[45:01.400 --> 45:07.400]  they're seeing yeah it's it's uh that's unlikely but there might be you know again what the the
[45:07.400 --> 45:12.040]  challenge is if somebody pulls a coup d'etat this is a cold coup by the queen now it's a coup
[45:12.760 --> 45:17.320]  the only answer to a cold coup of any kind is an open-ended nationwide general strike and there
[45:17.320 --> 45:22.200]  should be a and there should be a million canadians right now protesting in ottawa and that should
[45:22.200 --> 45:27.240]  be a general strike in other words shut it down uh did the model for all this stuff is the cop
[45:27.240 --> 45:36.360]  push in germany in uh what 1920 1921 a group of a sort of proto proto fascist uh civil servants
[45:36.360 --> 45:41.400]  and officers took over the government this is a cop and the answer to that was the social democratic
[45:41.400 --> 45:47.480]  party and the trade union said we're shutting it all down nothing moves and hendler tried that with
[45:47.480 --> 45:51.720]  the munich push a few years later right that's in it that's a second attempt at the cop put
[45:51.720 --> 45:55.560]  but the cop which is it is a case where they actually did seize the government in berlin and
[45:55.560 --> 46:00.680]  then had to give it up because the the ruling elite got scared and they said oh my god somebody's
[46:00.680 --> 46:06.600]  fighting we better back off and we'll try again another day they understand something that causes
[46:06.600 --> 46:10.440]  random explosions to be dangerous to them right but in this case there was there was a they had
[46:10.440 --> 46:14.520]  organization which we don't have and there was we don't have a social democratic party or anything
[46:14.520 --> 46:19.080]  like it we don't have a trade union we don't have a real liberal arm it's all infiltrated well we
[46:19.080 --> 46:23.800]  don't have mass organizations right that's the biggest thing is there's a complete atomization
[46:23.800 --> 46:29.080]  of the of the us well that's infiltration uh by the left gatekeepers uh and by the right gatekeepers
[46:29.080 --> 46:33.400]  into any organization i mean if we try to have a meeting of 200 people a provocateur shows up and
[46:33.400 --> 46:37.880]  tries to cause a problem so that gets into the whole other area of the science of dealing with
[46:37.880 --> 46:42.920]  them and throwing them out i mean i let very few in my office because i had folks show up randomly
[46:42.920 --> 46:46.440]  uh you know with the videotape and then try to claim we did something to him you know then run
[46:46.440 --> 46:51.720]  around there's major coantel pro in this town webster well the only way you fight the uh
[46:51.720 --> 46:56.920]  the arrogance of secret intelligence agencies and people who do this is with mass organization and
[46:56.920 --> 47:01.560]  that's it's got to start with mass there's got to be more organizations too not just even you say mass
[47:01.560 --> 47:07.480]  those are easy to infiltrate with the with this tool the enemies developed uh what about a general
[47:07.480 --> 47:12.680]  manifesto of liberty and thousands of groups then joining together spontaneously and what the enemy
[47:12.680 --> 47:19.400]  is most worried about in their own uh military uh projections and that is flash mobs well uh
[47:19.400 --> 47:23.560]  a united front in other words a united problem because right now we don't have such an umbrella
[47:23.560 --> 47:27.960]  organization so we'd have to it would only the only thing we could do right now it would be realistic
[47:27.960 --> 47:32.680]  is to say let's have a united front i've talked about calling something like americans against
[47:32.680 --> 47:37.720]  fascism i believe this is an anti-fascist country i think that's the one thing we can still say
[47:37.720 --> 47:44.040]  about the u.s the american people are opposed to fascism and the stuff with obama it comes from
[47:44.040 --> 47:47.960]  the crimes of bush cheney and the neocons a lot of people thought they were voting against the
[47:47.960 --> 47:53.080]  devil they knew unfortunately they didn't know the devil they were getting who is several
[47:53.080 --> 47:58.760]  circles deeper in the inferno than bush and cheney right he comes from there pretty much
[47:58.760 --> 48:03.080]  but he's not he's not the bottom he's not quite the bottom still there's something even worse than
[48:03.080 --> 48:08.840]  than obama coming from the wings but uh the uh a lot of people thought they were voting against
[48:08.840 --> 48:13.400]  that and of course a lot of people are voting because they see a depression and they say well
[48:13.400 --> 48:17.800]  you know let's get these reactionary republicans out of there and let's get a democrat and maybe
[48:17.800 --> 48:21.720]  meanwhile the enemy had already seen that people were going to rebel after eight years of this
[48:21.720 --> 48:27.880]  so years ago they had groomed and prepared this foundation front with all of these stalinesque
[48:27.880 --> 48:33.320]  and and and and leninist cover points when really he's a corporatist to the core right and he's a
[48:33.320 --> 48:40.200]  musolini and and certainly he does have these overtones of of of soviet style totalitarianism
[48:40.200 --> 48:45.080]  beyond any doubt but the the ultimate they're borrowing from every i mean the most horrible
[48:45.080 --> 48:51.320]  pieces from every machine of dehumanization and and combining in here it's a cookbook and that's
[48:51.320 --> 48:57.320]  the cookbook of the of the cia people power coup or color revolution it's the key of 2004 cookbook
[48:57.320 --> 49:04.680]  it's the syphilis georgia 2003 2004 cookbook they've tried it someplace else they they've even tried
[49:05.240 --> 49:09.960]  in north of israel and lebanon to come in with these color revolutions but it seems like the
[49:09.960 --> 49:14.840]  color revolutions are blowing up on every front yeah but see that was the lebanon one is interesting
[49:14.840 --> 49:19.880]  because there they tried to do the cedars revolution with the rich christian marinites and so forth
[49:19.880 --> 49:24.520]  and they ran right up against in this case a real mass organization has below you can you can say
[49:24.520 --> 49:28.280]  what you want about hezbollah right you wouldn't want to endorse everything they do but that is an
[49:28.280 --> 49:33.080]  authentic mass organization and they stopped at cold and they showed that they could put more people
[49:33.080 --> 49:38.520]  into the streets than the than the hysterical mass media and you know the u.s. embassy and all
[49:38.520 --> 49:43.880]  their paid shills so that's a that's a real good example i mean you don't again we're not gonna
[49:43.880 --> 49:48.680]  we don't want to find a hezbollah here but no but i'm also an organization yeah exactly a mass
[49:48.680 --> 49:53.720]  organization stops them right now we don't have it so what we've got to do is i mean during the
[49:53.720 --> 49:58.920]  phase that we're in now up until january 20th the main thing i think is to educate people right
[49:58.920 --> 50:04.040]  to denounce these people as they come forward right oh robert gates who's he well that's big
[50:04.040 --> 50:11.080]  new burjinski's office boy from 1977 to 1979 that's a that's a guy who was up to his neck in the

[55:01.560 --> 55:07.480]  them to run around the 50 60 70s 80s this just didn't begin with brzezinski to menace governments
[55:07.480 --> 55:11.800]  that the establishment didn't like and then after they let the extremist muslims take over then the
[55:11.800 --> 55:17.800]  west has a new enemy and recycles that uh but the point of uh robert gates the secretary defense
[55:17.800 --> 55:24.840]  that obama has said he's keeping over uh being literally uh the brzezinski uh man at the al-qaeda
[55:24.840 --> 55:32.760]  desk with its founding uh its organization in the late 1970s i think gates gates sets the stage
[55:32.760 --> 55:38.120]  from a couple of points of view uh last wednesday i got up in the morning go outside get the washington
[55:38.120 --> 55:44.600]  post gates will stay at the pentagon reading this thing in the afternoon reports coming in
[55:44.600 --> 55:53.160]  Mumbai terrorism so the same day that the world learned in the papers that obama had uh essentially
[55:53.160 --> 55:59.000]  accepted the dictation of his handlers to keep gates at the pentagon throw out all this stuff
[55:59.000 --> 56:06.120]  about hope and change uh change no more change gates stays at the pentagon now robert gates who is
[56:06.120 --> 56:14.600]  this person uh robert gates first of all was as brzezinski says from 1977 to 1979 80 when
[56:14.600 --> 56:19.640]  brzezinski came to the national security council of the jimmy carter twilateral administration
[56:19.640 --> 56:24.280]  every morning the first person he saw in the morning was robert gates and the last person
[56:24.280 --> 56:30.040]  he saw in the evening when he left was robert gates so robert gates was his right hand man
[56:30.040 --> 56:37.080]  his girl friday his uh his office boy his gopher his minion and we see this with these apprentices
[56:37.080 --> 56:43.080]  with these sith lords just like kashkari is paulson's long-term servant minion now handing out the
[56:43.080 --> 56:50.120]  8.4 trill right so gates uh gates is a clone of zbigniew brzezinski they say he's a republican
[56:50.120 --> 56:55.240]  that this doesn't matter at all his former cia director we're going to get to it his career
[56:55.240 --> 57:01.000]  was sponsored by by zbigniew brzezinski now recently gates signaled to all of us what he's
[57:01.000 --> 57:05.000]  going to do and he gave a he gave a speech i don't know if you saw this it's the carnegie
[57:05.000 --> 57:10.360]  endowment for international peace yes with jessica mathews the real think tank that really
[57:10.360 --> 57:15.320]  makes a lot of policy it's a pretty high level one it's older uh jessica mathews of course this
[57:15.320 --> 57:20.760]  is the daughter of barbara tuckman this is the daughter of kuhn lobe warburg all this stuff
[57:20.760 --> 57:27.240]  the attempted nazi kuhn the 30s right but she so she's there uh and and gates is in a he's in a
[57:27.240 --> 57:32.760]  mood of nostalgia and he says hey jessica speaking to a gathering at the uh at the
[57:32.760 --> 57:37.880]  carnegie endowment he says jessica do you remember when both of us worked for his big new brzezinski
[57:37.880 --> 57:44.040]  at the uh national security council and we got this invitation to go to algears in algeria
[57:44.040 --> 57:49.560]  on april first i believe it was of 1978 because that was the national day and there was an
[57:49.560 --> 57:55.640]  opportunity to meet with the iranian leadership in other words the komeini acts the komeini guys
[57:55.640 --> 58:00.760]  the komeini prime minister the komeini defense minister and the komeini foreign minister got
[58:00.760 --> 58:05.800]  that guy was yazdi he was the most important of these and he says jessica you remember
[58:05.800 --> 58:10.200]  house big new gabas beach and he laid it all out for the iranians and he said to them in a private
[58:10.200 --> 58:15.000]  meeting look iranians stay there we've got a break back in 70 seconds with this riveting it vital

[59:25.800 --> 59:34.760]  it's now time to take the revolution at the next level waging war on corruption alex jones
[59:34.760 --> 59:49.800]  on the gcm radio network big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well
[59:49.800 --> 59:59.400]  so does he he's alex jones on the gcm radio network and now live from austin texas alex jones
[1:00:00.360 --> 1:00:06.920]  and we're certainly in studio with us we're getting into right now the real obama administration the
[1:00:06.920 --> 1:00:12.920]  real players and individuals that he is putting in place and if it is possible it's an even more
[1:00:12.920 --> 1:00:18.920]  cold-blooded wicked group of anglo-american oligarchs but now with left cover and we were
[1:00:18.920 --> 1:00:25.800]  getting into just just one person of countless robert gates that he is bringing in to continue on
[1:00:25.800 --> 1:00:32.600]  a secretary of defense meeting with the come up the the comaniacs uh in 78 right as they're being
[1:00:32.600 --> 1:00:39.720]  about to be installed uh there uh uh in iran so let's continue with the founding of al ciaida
[1:00:39.720 --> 1:00:46.680]  and then that will be a perfect uh segway into mubai all of the just happened in india so gates
[1:00:46.680 --> 1:00:51.880]  is is a is is a clone of brisinski he was his office boy at the national security council 70
[1:00:51.880 --> 1:00:59.080]  77 to 79 and then you get uh brisinski coming out with this proposition that islamic fundamentalism
[1:00:59.080 --> 1:01:05.240]  is the greatest bulwark against soviet communism and soviet imperialism so brisinski plays the
[1:01:05.240 --> 1:01:10.840]  islamic fundamentalist card with the vengeance brisinski is the founder of islamic modern islamic
[1:01:10.840 --> 1:01:16.440]  fundamentalism he's the one who who made these people great so we have then the secret meeting
[1:01:16.440 --> 1:01:21.800]  and i cover this in uh in obama the postmodern coup it was actually so hot that there was some
[1:01:21.800 --> 1:01:25.240]  some some of the additions around the world say hey wait a minute can you prove this well
[1:01:25.240 --> 1:01:29.720]  in meantime i can because gates has come out and said it so gates meets but that's in so many
[1:01:29.720 --> 1:01:33.880]  historical records i mean i mean i knew that 15 years ago and i didn't know one day in general
[1:01:33.880 --> 1:01:42.200]  but the specific meeting and here's your specific meeting okay and it comes to the hostages because
[1:01:42.200 --> 1:01:46.680]  here we have brisinski meeting with yazdi now they're in power the commanding x of c's power
[1:01:46.680 --> 1:01:51.800]  they're they're running iran like the shah is is fled he's in the u.s at this point so brisinski
[1:01:51.800 --> 1:01:56.920]  talks to the foreign minister yazdi who's a environmentalist wacko he's a crazy eugenicist
[1:01:56.920 --> 1:02:05.000]  yeah genesis he's a paul pot he's a paul pot of of of iran is the idea a lifehater yeah so he uh
[1:02:05.000 --> 1:02:09.960]  he um they're talking so brisinski and this is gates telling the story so gates is telling the
[1:02:09.960 --> 1:02:16.440]  tarnagy endowment you know brisinski laid it all out he said look we don't like komane but
[1:02:17.480 --> 1:02:20.920]  we're going to give you all the weapons the shah had ordered everything the shah wanted
[1:02:20.920 --> 1:02:24.760]  we're going to give you we're going to give you all the weapons right the hawk missiles the uh
[1:02:24.760 --> 1:02:30.760]  you know every spare parts for your airplanes because we have a common enemy it's the soviets
[1:02:30.760 --> 1:02:36.600]  to your north the soviets are our common enemy so we're going to arm you so the the the intent
[1:02:36.600 --> 1:02:42.600]  is clear what what gates is trying to do is to say remember that our basic approach to iran over
[1:02:42.600 --> 1:02:48.360]  decades is to play iran against the russians in a war centered on the caspian sea yeah that's why
[1:02:48.360 --> 1:02:52.200]  we're in the middle east to begin with i mean it's not just about weapons contracts or oil
[1:02:52.200 --> 1:02:55.960]  it's not so much even about israel though that's a part of it it's really about and this is stated
[1:02:55.960 --> 1:03:00.760]  by the pentagon the encirclement of russia the containment of china right world power of which
[1:03:00.760 --> 1:03:04.600]  these other things that you mentioned the oil and the israelis are subsets but it's about world
[1:03:04.600 --> 1:03:07.160]  domination because when you're dealing with the russians and that's always good when you have
[1:03:07.160 --> 1:03:13.000]  subsets because that gets all the power blocks together when you have them unified with gain
[1:03:13.000 --> 1:03:17.080]  right which is what bush failed to do which is now what obama will try to do so that is the
[1:03:17.080 --> 1:03:21.320]  nuance we're hearing there's going to be nuance and that's going to be a more nuanced more more
[1:03:21.320 --> 1:03:27.160]  serpentine uh Byzantine uh deployment yeah the new the nuances instead of you bombing iran
[1:03:27.160 --> 1:03:32.520]  prosk you play iran against the russians and get get rid of both of them that way rather than
[1:03:32.520 --> 1:03:37.400]  ending up bogged down in the war yourself so what gate says then brzezinski tells the iranians look
[1:03:37.400 --> 1:03:42.280]  we're going to give you all the weapons you want and they say fine give us the shah and brzezinski
[1:03:42.280 --> 1:03:46.120]  gets all huffy and says no we can't give you the shah because that that would have been a tremendous
[1:03:46.120 --> 1:03:52.760]  political suicide for carter so out of this meeting then comes the idea of doing what let's get some
[1:03:52.760 --> 1:03:57.640]  hostages taken this this is not the part that the gates will tell you gates will not admit to this
[1:03:57.640 --> 1:04:03.480]  part but the whole business for the hostages in iran was to say we want the komani acts to take
[1:04:03.480 --> 1:04:09.720]  the u.s embassy personnel as hostages because with that the whole u.s bureaucracy has an excuse a
[1:04:09.720 --> 1:04:15.080]  cover story if anybody says why are you shipping weapons to iran they could say we're doing it
[1:04:15.080 --> 1:04:19.880]  to save the lives of these four hostages and we know they did give them the armaments and they did
[1:04:19.880 --> 1:04:25.240]  and that's iran contra now so we gotta break again we're gonna come back and have plenty of time
[1:04:25.240 --> 1:04:31.240]  the long segment then let's get into what happened in mubai uh different place same story same story

[1:07:46.920 --> 1:07:51.000]  the alex jones show because there's a war on for your mind
[1:07:51.000 --> 1:08:02.760]  okay webster let's get right back into how the islamo fascist as the neocons like to call them
[1:08:02.760 --> 1:08:09.240]  were actually put into power vis a big new brzezinski and of course secretary of defense gates at
[1:08:09.240 --> 1:08:14.920]  the time who was the man handling iran contra and this is a historical fact and you bring this up
[1:08:14.920 --> 1:08:20.200]  to conservatives and i mean i had a you know special forces guy black ops guy who's now a
[1:08:20.200 --> 1:08:24.120]  lawyer you know with the terrorism center and he's saying we've got to have basically world war
[1:08:24.120 --> 1:08:28.280]  three because the iranians are going to nuke us and kill us and oh my god the islamo fascist
[1:08:28.280 --> 1:08:32.120]  when it's a fact that the that there were that there were already you know the these
[1:08:32.120 --> 1:08:37.640]  extremist muslims and they were energized by the west so continue so the basic idea is that that
[1:08:37.640 --> 1:08:45.240]  that brzezinski gates and and carter and cyrus vance well trilaterals all uh over through the
[1:08:45.240 --> 1:08:51.240]  shah not only did they overthrow the shah but they insisted on bringing in komeini not a general's
[1:08:51.240 --> 1:08:57.000]  coup not this guy bactar who was around but it had to be komeini because islamic fundamentalism
[1:08:57.000 --> 1:09:03.240]  was the great ball walking and soviet communism so after this april 1978 meeting in algears with
[1:09:03.240 --> 1:09:08.280]  brzezinski and yazdi there was agreement that the u.s is going to continue to deliver weapons and
[1:09:08.280 --> 1:09:13.240]  then there's a side agreement between brzezinski and yazdi that nobody talks about i believe
[1:09:13.240 --> 1:09:17.480]  in which they say all right we're going to have a taking of hostages and there's a lot of stuff
[1:09:18.200 --> 1:09:22.120]  and i'd go through it and i got a part on the carter administration in this book
[1:09:22.120 --> 1:09:26.840]  now the october surprise was then the freeing of the hostages right and the trick was to try to
[1:09:26.840 --> 1:09:32.280]  make sure that the hostages were not freed under carter before november 1980 because that would
[1:09:32.280 --> 1:09:37.400]  have gotten carter reelected or or by the and then as soon as reagan's elected they release him right
[1:09:37.400 --> 1:09:42.520]  now there was there were then hearings uh this guy gary sick you may remember him gary sick from
[1:09:42.520 --> 1:09:47.320]  the state department or whatever he was he promoted these hearings about the october surprise and back
[1:09:47.320 --> 1:09:53.880]  in my book george bush the unauthorized biography 1992 i read about the fact that there were lots
[1:09:53.880 --> 1:09:58.920]  of reports that george bush the elder personally flew to paris one night in a private jet to meet
[1:09:58.920 --> 1:10:04.120]  with some iranians and then come back we know that kissinger was reported to be negotiating with
[1:10:04.120 --> 1:10:09.320]  iranians and and others uh uh you know dick uh whatever his name was the guy in the the other
[1:10:09.320 --> 1:10:14.360]  guy in the reagan national security council um the thing that barbara hanager has written about
[1:10:14.360 --> 1:10:21.480]  but now when when those hearings started the soviet government moscow sent a whole uh
[1:10:21.480 --> 1:10:26.840]  bunch of of information to the senate committee actually the house committee with lee hamilton
[1:10:26.840 --> 1:10:31.560]  our dear friend lee hamilton was such a good investigator as we know from 9 11 and it said
[1:10:31.560 --> 1:10:39.000]  look here's all the information about robert gates up to his neck in iran contra or what was
[1:10:39.000 --> 1:10:45.000]  then going to be called iran contra and above all the october surprise so this guy is dirty now the
[1:10:45.000 --> 1:10:50.200]  other dimension on him is as he writes in his own memoirs and this i write about in uh in uh
[1:10:50.200 --> 1:10:56.600]  9 11 synthetic terra made in usa gates wrote his memoirs and he said we considered creating
[1:10:56.600 --> 1:11:02.920]  an arab legion of fighters from all the arab countries to go into afghanistan which is not
[1:11:02.920 --> 1:11:09.960]  arab but muslim and fight the soviets but we decided not to do it yeah bunk you did decide to do it
[1:11:09.960 --> 1:11:18.040]  and it's called al-qaeda so robert gates is fighting his own illegitimate child we might say right
[1:11:18.040 --> 1:11:23.160]  robert gates at the pentagon is directing the worldwide struggle against al-qaeda which he
[1:11:23.160 --> 1:11:30.200]  founded and when his when he was named back in uh 2006 i put out a short release about this thing
[1:11:30.200 --> 1:11:34.520]  this guy should not be the head of the pentagon because he's the founder of al-qaeda let's expand
[1:11:34.520 --> 1:11:39.160]  on that they're not fighting al-qaeda uh as we know five years ago i reported in cyhurst three
[1:11:39.160 --> 1:11:43.880]  and a half years ago and then last year the white house at whitehouse.gov puts out a press release
[1:11:43.880 --> 1:11:52.120]  saying we are funding uh pro-democracy forces here are the four groups uh in eastern iraq into
[1:11:52.920 --> 1:11:57.880]  iran and they are these wahhabis groups and there was one little curd group tacked on
[1:11:57.880 --> 1:12:02.520]  and then it turned out the guy commanding the largest group was the number three listed by
[1:12:02.520 --> 1:12:09.080]  the fbi number three in al-qaeda and they're staging terror attacks all over iran and iran is now
[1:12:09.080 --> 1:12:16.120]  suing the united states for blowing up mass schools police stations and then bush i remember last
[1:12:16.120 --> 1:12:21.880]  year with mohammed carzai on the one in the rose garden said we need to go into iran because iran
[1:12:21.880 --> 1:12:27.240]  is funding al-qaeda in afghanistan and carzai even though he's this puppet unicoil you know narcotics
[1:12:27.240 --> 1:12:32.200]  trafficker he he says excuse me mr president he knew this was on tv overseas and this was like
[1:12:32.200 --> 1:12:38.680]  saying that you know spiderman really lives or or that santa claus is real he said uh iran is she
[1:12:38.680 --> 1:12:45.800]  eyed and they're actually helping us uh fight uh the wahhabis which are suny and uh we're friends
[1:12:45.800 --> 1:12:51.480]  with iran and bush said no that's not true iran is al-qaeda and we saw many other people say this
[1:12:51.480 --> 1:12:55.720]  so so of course bush knows that's not the case they're talking to the public like their complete
[1:12:55.720 --> 1:13:01.800]  morons and so al-qaeda clearly just this catchall for muslim groups they don't control but then when
[1:13:01.800 --> 1:13:09.080]  they have real terror attacks at stage let's now get into mumbai well we know uh obama first of all
[1:13:09.080 --> 1:13:14.680]  is the greatest paki basher of all time in other words obama is the guy who ran for president
[1:13:14.680 --> 1:13:18.760]  saying i'm gonna bomb the hell out of pakistan and then magically the crisis appears and the
[1:13:18.760 --> 1:13:23.560]  crisis appears now let me stress again i do not believe there's going to be an attack on iran no
[1:13:23.560 --> 1:13:29.000]  because i not not that i can see i'll be very surprised okay but israel says they may go in
[1:13:29.000 --> 1:13:34.520]  i think this is uh this is a lot of wrestling and it's so there's a negotiation going on but as i ran
[1:13:35.080 --> 1:13:40.440]  still part of this or have they broken off from the neocons you look at uh it's not the neocons
[1:13:40.440 --> 1:13:43.800]  i mean i know it's the i know it's the i know it's the i know it's the liberal region ski is the
[1:13:43.800 --> 1:13:49.240]  i understand it's the difference is that it's the harvard phd but i'm the harvard boutique yeah it's
[1:13:49.240 --> 1:13:53.720]  that office but what i'm saying is i'm saying did they break off during the neocon time they break
[1:13:53.720 --> 1:13:59.000]  off before uh there have there's been a period of bad relations okay but and and you know there's
[1:13:59.000 --> 1:14:04.280]  mass politics and other things that go into this but right now obama ran on a brzezinski platform
[1:14:04.280 --> 1:14:08.520]  which is to say i'm going to bomb and destroy pakistan and i'm going to negotiate with iran
[1:14:08.520 --> 1:14:13.160]  what are you going to negotiate with iran you're going to negotiate the terms by which iran becomes
[1:14:13.160 --> 1:14:19.160]  a cat's paw for the us in the caspian sea against the enemy to the north and that's of course it's
[1:14:19.160 --> 1:14:26.200]  still russia bust up the uh the baku caspian sea uh oil thing get an iranian fleet in the
[1:14:26.200 --> 1:14:31.560]  caspian sea an iranian fleet with nuclear weapons if you look at brzezinski's track record his track
[1:14:31.560 --> 1:14:37.400]  record is delivering very advanced military hardware why did the west held up why did the
[1:14:37.400 --> 1:14:43.800]  west help deliver the the components uh england the us to iran yeah because that was geopolitics
[1:14:43.800 --> 1:14:48.040]  then and it's geopolitics now this geo strategic because he likes to say now if you look at what
[1:14:48.040 --> 1:14:52.920]  brzezinski writes he goes as far as he can he says once we normalize relations between the us
[1:14:52.920 --> 1:14:59.000]  and iran iran could be could resume its usual role of being a positive factor in regional
[1:14:59.000 --> 1:15:03.560]  stability now there used to be this thing called sento remember the central treaty organization
[1:15:03.560 --> 1:15:09.320]  i think it was turkey iraq iran pakistan it fell apart really in the in the 60s it fell apart
[1:15:09.320 --> 1:15:13.480]  during the during the vietnam war but they'd like they'd like to get back to this the idea would be
[1:15:13.480 --> 1:15:18.360]  play iran against the russian now moving to pakistan this is a totally different story
[1:15:18.360 --> 1:15:24.360]  the whole business in afghanistan is now being run for one purpose and one purpose only break up
[1:15:24.360 --> 1:15:30.040]  pakistan destroy it with iran you want to negotiate you'd like to have a different government but
[1:15:30.040 --> 1:15:35.480]  for the moment it's going to be a puppet ultimately their schedule to be carved up into six or seven
[1:15:35.480 --> 1:15:42.440]  parts as well but the hot the front burner let's say the hot topic is is pakistan now why pakistan
[1:15:43.000 --> 1:15:49.000]  because it's a chinese ally it's it has a border with china and china needs the pipelines that come
[1:15:49.000 --> 1:15:53.960]  through it and china has said in an indian uh pakistan conflict they are now siding they said
[1:15:53.960 --> 1:15:58.360]  two days ago with pakistan yeah and this is a this is a you know long-term thing remember the
[1:15:58.360 --> 1:16:04.520]  sino-soviet split india went with the russians but pakistan went most decidedly with the chinese
[1:16:04.520 --> 1:16:08.920]  because they have a common border if you look at pakistan it goes from the arabian sea
[1:16:08.920 --> 1:16:14.840]  and it joins pak it joins with china above india above then you've got napal and all that yeah but
[1:16:14.840 --> 1:16:19.400]  they're further down the main thing is that there's a common border between pakistan and china and
[1:16:19.400 --> 1:16:24.920]  there's this port guadar we got it you got to get rid of the old map of the persian gulf and get a
[1:16:24.920 --> 1:16:31.880]  really big brzezinski style map guadar is this deep water port at the arabian sea so it's south
[1:16:32.520 --> 1:16:38.600]  west pakistan not so far from iran but above all the straits of hummus are there so the idea with
[1:16:38.600 --> 1:16:45.240]  the chinese is if they could get tankers coming from saudi arabia iraq iran from those tanker
[1:16:45.240 --> 1:16:51.160]  terminals coming out of the straits of hummus they could build a pipeline that would go up pakistan
[1:16:51.160 --> 1:16:55.720]  that's a pipeline it's not there yet but they need that and let's stop that's their only avenue
[1:16:55.720 --> 1:16:59.720]  except for russia but russia doesn't have big terminals near there and it's landlocked because
[1:16:59.720 --> 1:17:02.920]  therefore you get away from the you also got the you also got the himalayas so they can't get it
[1:17:02.920 --> 1:17:07.160]  from russia uh well you can maybe go around it but the main thing is the anglo-american fleets
[1:17:07.160 --> 1:17:11.400]  the anglo-american naval domination of the persian gulf and the arabian sea is key to the
[1:17:11.400 --> 1:17:16.680]  work around that and if you can if you're china and you get you make pakistan into your energy
[1:17:16.680 --> 1:17:22.040]  corridor you can do two things you can have a pipeline that goes directly from iran to pakistan
[1:17:22.040 --> 1:17:27.880]  to china there you have your guaranteed oil supply with no anglo-american air fleet anywhere and then
[1:17:27.880 --> 1:17:32.120]  you can develop the railway cities and then have china dominate the region now let's stop right there
[1:17:32.120 --> 1:17:35.320]  because we're almost out of time but we have a little bit left in this segment and a five minute
[1:17:35.320 --> 1:17:42.840]  segment now how does the move by bombay situation play into all of this and what is your analysis
[1:17:42.840 --> 1:17:46.520]  of what really happened there okay first of all this is basically it's coming you know as if
[1:17:46.520 --> 1:17:51.800]  on q right it's just when they need it remember there's an indian u.s nuclear accord that was
[1:17:51.800 --> 1:17:56.920]  approved in october in the hurley burley and brouhaha the presidential campaign we might have missed
[1:17:56.920 --> 1:18:01.960]  the fact that india has now become the spear point of the u.s the british and the israelis
[1:18:01.960 --> 1:18:06.760]  in eurasia it's what the british used to call a continental dagger india is a continental dagger
[1:18:06.760 --> 1:18:13.080]  it's 1.2 billion pieces of cannon fodder from the point of view of the u.s the british uh and the
[1:18:13.080 --> 1:18:17.320]  israeli so the idea is to play them against china play them against russia play them against
[1:18:17.320 --> 1:18:24.200]  pakistan play them to to bust up any possibility of eurasian of a coalition yeah a coalition so uh
[1:18:25.160 --> 1:18:29.240]  the other side of it is this port of godard that has become operational this year and they
[1:18:29.240 --> 1:18:34.280]  can begin they could build a pipeline up there that would go straight into china it would cut
[1:18:34.280 --> 1:18:39.080]  about 25 percent of the cost and would save them about 12 i understand i understand why it's happening
[1:18:39.080 --> 1:18:43.640]  but what i mean looking at that's who we have let's look at the attacks you basically got five or
[1:18:43.640 --> 1:18:48.600]  six indications right first thing is anything happening in the indian subcontinent the british
[1:18:48.600 --> 1:18:53.560]  are always the prime suspect always look for the old colonial power the british were there for 200
[1:18:53.560 --> 1:19:00.200]  250 years anything in india pakistan looked to the british what do we find that the initial reports
[1:19:00.200 --> 1:19:06.280]  were that they were british citizens they were pakistani origin british citizens were some of
[1:19:06.280 --> 1:19:11.560]  the killers those were early reports that then somehow uh disappeared so what do we got there
[1:19:11.560 --> 1:19:16.760]  rickston mosque finnsbury mosque maybe they have an operation up in leeds in yorkshire
[1:19:16.760 --> 1:19:21.960]  they can recruit pakistanis they get him out of her majesties prisons they can brainwash him
[1:19:21.960 --> 1:19:28.120]  they can send him over that's number one secondly the israeli israel in india have this tremendously
[1:19:28.120 --> 1:19:34.120]  developed special relations like the the indians are always buying hardware webster stay there webster
[1:19:34.120 --> 1:19:38.440]  stay there we've got a break again this is so important you know i may have you just come back

[1:24:04.280 --> 1:24:09.400]  in another room here's a sunday show and i'll have to tell folks when that is on here on the gc
[1:24:09.400 --> 1:24:16.280]  network this is radio and it uh it's available of course on demand like all the shows are but uh
[1:24:16.280 --> 1:24:21.800]  for me it's a whole week it's a weekly show i tape it on friday afternoon and it comes on saturday
[1:24:21.800 --> 1:24:27.400]  afternoon two o'clock eastern so one o'clock central all right good folks can hear that on demand
[1:24:27.400 --> 1:24:30.680]  okay a little bit of time we have left we're gonna bring you back in on the move by attacks
[1:24:30.680 --> 1:24:34.520]  because it's so important they say they're going into pakistan they say there's going to be a crisis
[1:24:34.520 --> 1:24:41.000]  there and then on cue it starts and you were talking about the israeli situation uh and this
[1:24:41.000 --> 1:24:45.960]  could be a reverse false flag could be a setup but they were wearing the large hindu sect Zionist
[1:24:46.840 --> 1:24:53.560]  wristbands uh they they had lsd cocaine classic mind control uh you have the intelligence chief
[1:24:53.560 --> 1:24:59.000]  who'd been saying who just caught them months ago the indians uh he busted a carray yes yes
[1:24:59.000 --> 1:25:02.920]  they killed them yes well let's get into that because that i mean the evidence there's hundreds
[1:25:02.920 --> 1:25:08.520]  of pieces uh only terrorism chiefs that had exposed the indian government was staging terror attacks
[1:25:08.520 --> 1:25:14.680]  they all die within minutes right so basically the british we've done the israelis general misrahi
[1:25:14.680 --> 1:25:20.760]  the head of the of the israeli armed forces ground forces goes to the disputed area of kashmir
[1:25:20.760 --> 1:25:26.040]  that's a bigger front to the muslim pakistani side of it right the whole kashmir issue is
[1:25:26.040 --> 1:25:31.480]  something that we should uh we should go through it's basically india is occupying islamic populations
[1:25:31.480 --> 1:25:36.040]  the un resolutions on kashmir is that they are supposed to be free elections who's blocking
[1:25:36.040 --> 1:25:42.040]  the free elections is india not pakistan so uh the israelis are very big you could also say look
[1:25:42.040 --> 1:25:47.160]  look at the ineptitude look at the stupidity of these of the indian special forces right
[1:25:47.160 --> 1:25:51.480]  they were trained by the israelis and now they're screwing it all up well no no they went on for
[1:25:51.480 --> 1:25:58.120]  65 hours they stood they stand down and don't shoot and then five of the terrorism chiefs
[1:25:58.120 --> 1:26:02.760]  and deputies who'd all criticize the government they are the ones that only magically get triple
[1:26:02.760 --> 1:26:09.240]  tapped a piece right impossible but now concerning this the the the uh the us let's not forget the
[1:26:09.240 --> 1:26:13.880]  the the us in the in the so-called federally administered tribal areas in other words the
[1:26:13.880 --> 1:26:21.000]  northwest frontier the northwest area of pakistan that that's along the afghan border the the cia
[1:26:21.000 --> 1:26:26.760]  in addition to flying these predator drones is they also have uh stations i mean they have uh
[1:26:26.760 --> 1:26:31.880]  strong points right they have they have centers of operations among the federally administered
[1:26:31.880 --> 1:26:38.360]  tribal areas and we can assume that they're busily recruiting patsies fanatics crazies
[1:26:38.360 --> 1:26:43.640]  mercenaries hooligans whatever to also become terrors what one of the things the pakistanis
[1:26:43.640 --> 1:26:49.000]  ought to do is to kick the cia out of those federally administered tribal areas not let them
[1:26:49.000 --> 1:26:54.520]  in there anymore okay in the few minutes we got ready now two more the hindus the hindus the rss
[1:26:54.520 --> 1:27:01.960]  okay there's this thing the rss is a hindu extremist racist organization with strong fascist
[1:27:01.960 --> 1:27:08.280]  overtone they killed gondi yeah in effect they have been they're the descendants of the killers of
[1:27:08.280 --> 1:27:12.280]  gondi exactly they're because he wouldn't kill muslims right because he was not in favor of
[1:27:12.280 --> 1:27:16.600]  religious war so here we have the religious war party and sure enough the us and the british are
[1:27:16.600 --> 1:27:20.040]  backing and they're the ones tied in with israel that would be as far as i can see the ones with
[1:27:20.040 --> 1:27:25.960]  the with this blue uh or the sorry pink the pink arm band that the one guy was wearing but the
[1:27:25.960 --> 1:27:30.120]  see the rss has been killing people all over india for years and years you never hear about and
[1:27:30.120 --> 1:27:35.160]  it's rss infiltrators that keep doing false flags and muslims look you go you have a terrorist swamp
[1:27:35.160 --> 1:27:39.560]  then you have the rss provides the etiology for that then you have the bjp which is the governing
[1:27:39.560 --> 1:27:43.640]  party and they are now bidding fair to take over the government again in the backlash to what has
[1:27:43.640 --> 1:27:48.280]  just gone on and they give the conduit or the tunnel for the people to be brought in but but
[1:27:48.280 --> 1:27:53.880]  putting an end cap on this because it's about the end cap is the raw r a w you heard about the isi
[1:27:53.880 --> 1:28:00.760]  right now everybody knows the isi about the raw the research and uh um whatever they call it the
[1:28:00.760 --> 1:28:07.160]  research and uh something oh research an analysis wing the research and analysis wing of indian
[1:28:07.160 --> 1:28:14.520]  intelligence they are up in afghanistan recruiting crazies from afghanistan to bring them down and
[1:28:14.520 --> 1:28:20.600]  have them engage in terrorism against pakistan so the indians have a real dirty aspect maybe
[1:28:20.600 --> 1:28:25.160]  maybe these well it's these same groups setting off bombings the last few months trying to overthrow
[1:28:25.160 --> 1:28:29.880]  the pakistani government and they're admittedly west right back and and the pakistani government
[1:28:29.880 --> 1:28:35.400]  has been saying the west is staging this is a pretext that was the final point to bring pressure
[1:28:35.400 --> 1:28:41.320]  in on pakistan or even overthrow them so when you come back in a few hours we will break down that
[1:28:41.320 --> 1:28:45.720]  but in the last minute we have to talk about that just what is the point of all this the point of it
[1:28:45.720 --> 1:28:50.840]  is to play india against pakistan bring in a radical government bring in a radical war government
[1:28:50.840 --> 1:28:55.640]  india and if you if you put if you play india against pakistan you destroy both in other words
[1:28:55.640 --> 1:29:01.960]  the indian military would inflict grievous damage on pakistan but india is a country with one billion
[1:29:01.960 --> 1:29:08.120]  hindu's but there are 200 million muslims that'll cause tribal warfare so it's just like iran iraq
[1:29:08.120 --> 1:29:12.920]  being played off against each other both sides being funded by the us it's much bigger it's huge
[1:29:12.920 --> 1:29:18.040]  it's not 60 million and 20 million it's not 60 million 20 million both sides it's uh it's it's
[1:29:18.040 --> 1:29:21.720]  hundreds of millions against the billion plus and nuke's on both sides which in the in the case of
[1:29:21.720 --> 1:29:25.400]  the middle east the absolute and then that's the brookings institution and others coming out in
[1:29:25.400 --> 1:29:30.360]  rand a few months ago saying we need a world war something on that scale okay webster thank you

[1:36:07.640 --> 1:36:12.040]  know uh who you are i mean breakdown you what sold three four million albums worked on a lot of other
[1:36:12.040 --> 1:36:18.600]  huge albums yeah yeah i've um you know basically been making counter establishment hip hop that um
[1:36:18.600 --> 1:36:22.600]  that uh you know challenges the system is life affirming music that i've been making
[1:36:23.160 --> 1:36:31.000]  for the entirety of my career i started in uh in 1990 and uh was have been on a lot of different
[1:36:31.000 --> 1:36:39.960]  labels and uh and i am now completely independent and um well completely independent but distributed
[1:36:39.960 --> 1:36:46.440]  by universal uh ironically enough because they have noticed the fact that uh that there are people
[1:36:46.440 --> 1:36:52.840]  out here who hunger for this kind of material and um you know i have produced a public enemy and dead
[1:36:52.840 --> 1:36:58.200]  prayers and and uh the coup and a lot of other groups that are out there that represent these
[1:36:58.200 --> 1:37:09.080]  same sentiments and uh i'm still doing it peris uh let's let's go back to 2001 and then look at what
[1:37:09.080 --> 1:37:15.400]  happened there and your views and take on that and then let's accelerate forward to what's happening
[1:37:15.400 --> 1:37:20.280]  today uh geopolitically what's happening uh in different sectors of the world in your take
[1:37:20.280 --> 1:37:29.480]  on somebody like barack h obama well you know 2001 my my current company and that my last record
[1:37:29.480 --> 1:37:36.360]  which was sonic jihad which i guess got on your radar a while ago um occurred as a result of our
[1:37:36.360 --> 1:37:42.920]  response to 911 and you know after after doing a lot of independent research and and actually uh
[1:37:42.920 --> 1:37:47.960]  viewing some of your films and so can i look up a lot of the information that was available online
[1:37:47.960 --> 1:37:53.160]  i came to the conclusion as have you and most of the people listening to you that self that 911
[1:37:53.160 --> 1:37:59.160]  was a self-inflicted wound as you like to put it and uh seeing the response seeing the erosion of
[1:37:59.160 --> 1:38:04.360]  our civil liberties seeing the shredding of the bill of rights seeing the increase in intolerance
[1:38:04.360 --> 1:38:12.840]  seeing the increase in racism and racist wars uh around the world led me to want to become
[1:38:12.840 --> 1:38:19.880]  um more involved in making the protest statements and to endorsing material that reflects that
[1:38:19.880 --> 1:38:26.760]  viewpoint and so guerrilla funk was formed and my first record sonic jihad came out um
[1:38:29.400 --> 1:38:34.280]  it was pretty much a sale to buy you know a lot of the mainstream press outlets
[1:38:34.280 --> 1:38:40.360]  ms mbc fox knows the whole thing and it was embraced by people who recognized truth and uh
[1:38:40.360 --> 1:38:46.920]  uh they did well enough to get on universal's radar to allow me to be able to sign other artists
[1:38:46.920 --> 1:38:56.120]  to uh you know kind of rally the people uh around that that you know felt the same who were also
[1:38:56.120 --> 1:39:01.960]  disenfranchised and unavailable you know unable to come out through traditional outlets and
[1:39:03.000 --> 1:39:09.400]  you know i've seen the whole thing kind of uh you know in in some respects things have gotten
[1:39:09.400 --> 1:39:14.120]  worse than some when some respects things have gotten better at least from outside looking in
[1:39:14.120 --> 1:39:19.640]  well before we get into what's happening currently uh uh just uh you know finishing up on along the
[1:39:19.640 --> 1:39:24.280]  lines of the music you put out right i mean i have to say i mean i like some hip-hop i like some
[1:39:24.280 --> 1:39:28.680]  rap you know i grew up listening to a lot of it in dallas but but even then i only like certain
[1:39:28.680 --> 1:39:32.680]  people and others it sounded terrible but i mean i mean it's the same with every genre
[1:39:32.680 --> 1:39:39.160]  classical country rock and roll but particularly i don't know hard of really anybody
[1:39:39.160 --> 1:39:44.440]  else who when i listen to the music it sounds a hundred percent in my mind like i can't imagine
[1:39:44.440 --> 1:39:51.800]  it sounding uh any better with the beat uh your voice uh you know uh bringing in the the choir
[1:39:51.800 --> 1:39:56.920]  like you do with what would you do i mean just all of it so i mean i am really a fan just of
[1:39:56.920 --> 1:40:02.040]  your sound and then why it's a hundred percent then the message especially in some of those songs
[1:40:02.040 --> 1:40:06.920]  you did in that uh album after nine eleven i mean that's why i say i think it's really the anthem
[1:40:06.920 --> 1:40:11.720]  for nine eleven truth i mean i like uh immortal technique a lot of other folks and he's he's
[1:40:11.720 --> 1:40:16.200]  great and has a really great sound as well i just don't think that uh it's consistently as powerful
[1:40:16.200 --> 1:40:20.280]  uh as yours i mean i hate to i'm not trying to choose sides i'm just saying i mean i mean
[1:40:20.280 --> 1:40:27.160]  they're really only two real sides to so i like the difference between me and the moral technique
[1:40:27.160 --> 1:40:32.840]  those aren't the choices you know but uh uh i appreciate that man really i do i just always
[1:40:32.840 --> 1:40:36.760]  said that i was going to make music that i wouldn't be ashamed of in a few years
[1:40:36.760 --> 1:40:41.080]  that's really kind of my litmus test like when i'm when i'm doing things i want to treat each
[1:40:41.080 --> 1:40:45.560]  project as though i'll never get the chance to do it again which is a you know that's
[1:40:46.120 --> 1:40:50.520]  that's pretty legitimate well that's how life really works that's how life really works now
[1:40:50.520 --> 1:40:57.400]  now shifting gears uh everything is nuanced in the work like i just had webster tarpley in here
[1:40:57.400 --> 1:41:02.680]  with all the documents the united states funded the iranians to come to power gave them the weapons
[1:41:02.680 --> 1:41:10.520]  that's on record gates and brzezinski admit it now they're the guys behind obama and whereas i want
[1:41:10.520 --> 1:41:15.400]  to i mean i hate george bush call for his arrest you know terrorist and and and but you know people
[1:41:15.400 --> 1:41:19.400]  see this two-dimensional like well well you're against bush you must be for obama or if i'm
[1:41:19.400 --> 1:41:23.720]  against obama i must be for mccain when i'm against mccain i'm saying no they're all
[1:41:23.720 --> 1:41:28.120]  bought and paid for but then i look at who will be able to carry the new world order agenda further
[1:41:28.120 --> 1:41:35.160]  who will neutralize the left to stand down and say uh you know yes to war yes to a police day
[1:41:35.160 --> 1:41:41.160]  and then who will actually pacify the public so the abuse of black people minorities everybody
[1:41:41.160 --> 1:41:44.840]  can continue and you know nine ten months ago i said oh i like obama he says he'll get us out of
[1:41:44.840 --> 1:41:49.800]  the war he won't spy on the american people without warrants and then now he's gone backs i mean i'm
[1:41:49.800 --> 1:41:53.080]  just setting the table here and then i want you to take a lot of time going over this and so now
[1:41:53.080 --> 1:41:58.280]  with horror i'm seeing this now whereas i like seeing people happy in relations being good and
[1:41:58.280 --> 1:42:02.360]  black folks i see everywhere really i mean you can see a visual you know feeling good hey white
[1:42:02.360 --> 1:42:07.080]  people aren't all racist they elected a black guy whereas i wish that was a good beautiful thing
[1:42:07.080 --> 1:42:11.640]  i know that in the end it's going to be a huge betrayal and it's going to be designed to actually
[1:42:11.640 --> 1:42:17.080]  make everybody in a way even blame black people in the end when brock obama is a new world order
[1:42:17.080 --> 1:42:21.480]  frontman now if you disagree that's fine but i mean break down i mean i've laid that out it's so
[1:42:21.480 --> 1:42:27.400]  nuanced and and and the public only sees it you know in shades of black and white pun intended
[1:42:27.400 --> 1:42:37.000]  where do you see this going you know just like in uh a mubai cia masad mi6 are publicly funding the
[1:42:37.000 --> 1:42:42.280]  radical hindus the radical muslims bring them in so that they can get a radical group in control
[1:42:42.280 --> 1:42:48.040]  of india to then attack pakistan and i mean right there see that's nuanced i'm not against the hindus
[1:42:48.040 --> 1:42:53.720]  i'm not against the muslims i'm not against any i i want them to see how through tribal control
[1:42:53.720 --> 1:43:00.040]  they're being manipulated well i'm hoping that's not the case i do i really do i hope that's not
[1:43:00.040 --> 1:43:05.480]  the case the one thing that that causes me to have great pause about obama is the fact that
[1:43:05.480 --> 1:43:09.560]  the establishment immediately embraced him when he came out that's the one thing that you know
[1:43:09.560 --> 1:43:15.960]  so this whole idea of him being an agent of change and some kind of a uh a freedom fighter for
[1:43:15.960 --> 1:43:23.640]  social justice is pretty much scratched off the list for me um in terms of him being perhaps you
[1:43:23.640 --> 1:43:29.960]  know a lesser of many evils that's probably how i look at him at this point as a black man of course
[1:43:29.960 --> 1:43:35.320]  it it does make me feel good to see me being reflected in a position of power i'm not gonna lie
[1:43:35.320 --> 1:43:42.760]  about that but by the same token you know as a as a uh somebody that has progressive values
[1:43:42.760 --> 1:43:46.600]  man you know i am i am disheartened by some of the things that i've seen and some of the things
[1:43:46.600 --> 1:43:51.320]  that i've heard him say a lot of a lot of what he said during the campaign i wanted to chalk
[1:43:51.320 --> 1:43:57.240]  up to him needing to say to be able to get elected but now you know this whole idea of
[1:43:57.240 --> 1:44:02.760]  reaching across the aisle and you know i'm somebody who who has pretty hard left leaning
[1:44:02.760 --> 1:44:08.120]  positions man and and and i'm actually out for blood i don't want to reconcile with anybody
[1:44:08.120 --> 1:44:13.720]  you know i don't want to see um everything swept under the rug and everything be forgiven and you
[1:44:13.720 --> 1:44:19.640]  know us try to kind of forge this new path in this new direction with people who i am um
[1:44:20.840 --> 1:44:27.640]  you know ardently opposed to i want to see things happen the right way for change and i you know
[1:44:27.640 --> 1:44:32.200]  whether or not he's going to be the one to do it it's still it's still you know uh
[1:44:32.200 --> 1:44:40.200]  um we still don't know yet but i do know that i'm not in a in a reconciled mood well um and
[1:44:41.400 --> 1:44:47.560]  i've seen the establishment say that obama will bring the people back to trusting the government
[1:44:48.120 --> 1:44:54.600]  and and then look at who he's appointing it's all the same people yeah yeah exactly now as far as
[1:44:54.600 --> 1:44:59.240]  the people trust in the government i don't know if that'll ever happen again um i think that
[1:44:59.240 --> 1:45:05.720]  that first of all this economy has to turn around if it is to turn around before anybody pays
[1:45:05.720 --> 1:45:10.120]  attention to what anybody in the government has to say but that's it paris this is a designed
[1:45:10.120 --> 1:45:13.720]  and i want you to speak to this i have all the documents and i know you're well read gone you've
[1:45:13.720 --> 1:45:19.880]  got an economics degree there uh but i mean what's happening is uh the people under clinton and and
[1:45:19.880 --> 1:45:24.680]  the republican supported it's all one group they changed the uh glass deagle act they made the
[1:45:24.680 --> 1:45:30.680]  laws where the banks could do this they have designed this to implode markets so the establishment
[1:45:30.680 --> 1:45:35.400]  can then come in cut off liquidate everybody else have the real economy implode and the banks
[1:45:35.400 --> 1:45:41.800]  over capitalized in the quote bailout with now 8.4 trillion as of december 5th 2008 and then buy up
[1:45:41.800 --> 1:45:46.680]  what's left of the real economy and obama is the biggest cheerleader for that and when the bailout
[1:45:46.680 --> 1:45:51.240]  wasn't about to happen he got up there and and got on his bully pulpit and said we need this so
[1:45:51.240 --> 1:45:55.880]  i that's what i'm saying paris what are your feelings about this auto bailout then well i
[1:45:55.880 --> 1:46:03.160]  mean i see it as a distraction because 25 billion 40 billion compared to 8.4 trillion according to
[1:46:03.160 --> 1:46:08.440]  bloomberg and ap in seven weeks uh you know the whole debate about should we bail the autos out
[1:46:08.440 --> 1:46:15.000]  that's a diversion but i'm against socialism but if we're going to uh uh uh devalue the currency
[1:46:15.000 --> 1:46:19.160]  and turn up the printing presses i just say give every american fifty thousand dollars that's basically
[1:46:19.160 --> 1:46:23.320]  what the safe point uh four trillion comes out to i just say give it directly to the people
[1:46:23.320 --> 1:46:28.520]  because we're the ones that are going to pay it back in taxes anyways interesting well i know
[1:46:28.520 --> 1:46:33.000]  they just came out with the jobs for today so something over at over half a million jobs lost
[1:46:33.000 --> 1:46:38.280]  today and that's almost two million jobs lost since january it is year so it's definitely rough
[1:46:38.280 --> 1:46:43.000]  out there exactly and it's accelerating so i mean specifically what i'm saying here is in
[1:46:43.000 --> 1:46:48.520]  studying the world what i do is i just go to what the truth is and and and i go to what the real
[1:46:48.520 --> 1:46:56.120]  policy reports of the elite say and then and then i go diametrically opposed to them and and so and so
[1:46:56.120 --> 1:47:00.280]  my job's easy so it's contrarian there you go well let's bring a woman i'm just against their agenda
[1:47:00.280 --> 1:47:05.400]  because i know their agenda is bad for humanity here's another one i'm not against the tens of
[1:47:05.400 --> 1:47:09.960]  millions of people by chase manhattan city bank displaced in mexico driven off their ancestral
[1:47:09.960 --> 1:47:14.680]  lands through phony environmental movements using the left to force them into mexico city then into
[1:47:14.680 --> 1:47:19.480]  the united states i don't blame them wanting a better life i am against them being abused i've
[1:47:19.480 --> 1:47:23.800]  gone out and protested out at the femacant north of austin where they keep them without due process
[1:47:23.800 --> 1:47:29.080]  but at the same time i understand the globalist plan is to dissolve borders to drive down wages
[1:47:29.080 --> 1:47:36.200]  so paris shouldn't i be totally against something that is the cornerstone uh of the big banks uh
[1:47:36.200 --> 1:47:43.320]  against the united states see how that's nuanced which would be what well all i'm stating immigration
[1:47:43.320 --> 1:47:47.800]  yes i mean i know you bring that up in that and that you're certainly against the oppression of
[1:47:47.800 --> 1:47:52.360]  these people but at the same time i'm i'm going to the next level and i know you can grasp all
[1:47:52.360 --> 1:47:56.040]  this you're probably smarter than i am i've been more successful in business than i am so
[1:47:56.040 --> 1:48:01.240]  so i'm asking you the question give the new world order wants open borders and then actually
[1:48:01.240 --> 1:48:06.600]  wants to stir americans up with third world populations they bring in to divide and conquer
[1:48:06.600 --> 1:48:10.920]  what should i do should i go along with what the big foundations and the money wants to divide
[1:48:10.920 --> 1:48:14.920]  and conquer i just know that it's easy to scapegoat a population and i know that that this plays
[1:48:14.920 --> 1:48:21.320]  directly into the hands of america's racist legacy i agree you know so just in in in terms of looking
[1:48:21.320 --> 1:48:28.200]  at a particular group of people and and you know kind of galvanizing this this uh joda plumber
[1:48:28.200 --> 1:48:33.880]  public against them i'm i'm opposed to that now in terms of what the end result is going to be
[1:48:33.880 --> 1:48:38.600]  like this this this solution of borders and i'm i don't know if i even look into it that far
[1:48:38.600 --> 1:48:46.360]  i understand you know from where i'm sitting i see a a group of people who want a better life who
[1:48:46.920 --> 1:48:55.160]  you know are pretty much the kind of the end result of america's foreign policy of
[1:48:56.840 --> 1:49:01.240]  economically depriving people and you know so when you see people who want to come here to
[1:49:01.240 --> 1:49:06.440]  to kind of from what they think anyway because i've got first of all i don't necessarily know
[1:49:06.440 --> 1:49:09.880]  that america gives you the better life let me say that out the gate because i've traveled a
[1:49:09.880 --> 1:49:16.200]  bunch of other places where things seem to be a lot easier and a lot more people and uh they're
[1:49:16.200 --> 1:49:22.760]  not at least from at least right now they're not in uh any kind of danger of being invaded by america
[1:49:22.760 --> 1:49:27.400]  so all right let me throw this in i don't know paris paris let me throw this in yeah talk about
[1:49:27.400 --> 1:49:30.920]  nuance that's what i'm saying every as you know everything is five or six i don't think that
[1:49:30.920 --> 1:49:35.720]  anything occurs on the global stage by chance well well this is what i'm saying exactly but i want
[1:49:35.720 --> 1:49:38.920]  your take on this i want your take on this and we'll come back and talk about after the break
[1:49:38.920 --> 1:49:41.800]  and we're going to plug your new record and the website the rest of which is great stuff
[1:49:41.800 --> 1:49:46.920]  okay exactly they are announcing they're going to put 20 000 us troops on the treats of america
[1:49:46.920 --> 1:49:51.560]  the army document says it's going to be against the american people for civil insurrection but
[1:49:51.560 --> 1:49:56.200]  then they put out public press releases that it's going to be stopping the illegal aliens on the
[1:49:56.200 --> 1:50:01.560]  border but i know because they already did that two years ago that that stage and they're not even
[1:50:01.560 --> 1:50:07.880]  going to do that so you're right it's nuance they are using it as a stereotype catch all
[1:50:07.880 --> 1:50:13.400]  false galvanization to get people to rally around accepting a police state i guess so so
[1:50:13.400 --> 1:50:18.840]  what what are you are you thinking that there's going to be some kind of a national event that
[1:50:18.840 --> 1:50:23.720]  really brings this immigration debate to the surface because honestly that's that's kind of
[1:50:23.720 --> 1:50:29.160]  been squash lately i haven't heard that a lot i know that people become more intolerant as
[1:50:29.160 --> 1:50:34.600]  economic times get harder yes i know that well listen we'll take on this when we get back um
[1:50:35.640 --> 1:50:42.040]  i mean how to pull he made my point my point is yes they work both sides we'll be right back

[1:53:53.560 --> 1:54:00.040]  general it was deputy ag at the time covering up the murder of an Oklahoma city bombing a person
[1:54:00.040 --> 1:54:05.000]  they thought was a government agent that they were trying to get rid of they killed people
[1:54:05.000 --> 1:54:10.680]  involved with the trial exposing it that Jesse trying to do story is up on prisonplanet.com
[1:54:10.680 --> 1:54:15.400]  I could do a whole show on that and we aren't next week with Jesse trying to do again for two hours
[1:54:16.280 --> 1:54:21.160]  huge information we have the government documents that the that the federal government did carry
[1:54:21.160 --> 1:54:30.040]  out that bombing Paris the point I was trying to make is that yes the the global architects do all
[1:54:30.040 --> 1:54:34.760]  these evil things the name of America the press populations then they go in with Ford Foundation
[1:54:34.760 --> 1:54:38.760]  money and others and we have the Carnegie documents and all of it on this congressional hearings
[1:54:38.760 --> 1:54:44.840]  and then they foment rebellion and and then basically you know the average white guy you know
[1:54:44.840 --> 1:54:49.800]  uh you know taken as you know two-year-old for a walk down the street gets the blame as the evil
[1:54:49.800 --> 1:54:54.200]  new world order mastermind and you know just like uh you know black guys get blamed for supposedly
[1:54:54.200 --> 1:54:58.440]  being murderers because people think oj did something you know it it's this lowest common
[1:54:58.440 --> 1:55:05.720]  denominator and and yes they're going to use uh the uh huge uh social crises of 30 million people
[1:55:05.720 --> 1:55:09.560]  in this country you know who'll work for almost nothing uh you know because of what was done
[1:55:09.560 --> 1:55:14.760]  to Mexico by our own government by the globalist uh they then come in here and the government then
[1:55:14.760 --> 1:55:20.520]  uses that the name of going after them to actually oppress the entire population that was the point
[1:55:20.520 --> 1:55:29.880]  I was trying to make oh yeah well I got you in that regard I got you man it's uh it it as a rule
[1:55:29.880 --> 1:55:33.720]  of thumb I'm I take a contrarian stance when it comes to what the government has to say to
[1:55:34.360 --> 1:55:39.000]  you know when I'm told something is a particular way I choose to look at it the other way too just
[1:55:39.000 --> 1:55:44.120]  based on the history you know based on the history of oppression based on the policies
[1:55:44.120 --> 1:55:49.800]  and how they've affected people over the over time so yeah I know you know there's a lot going on
[1:55:49.800 --> 1:55:54.280]  we've got about 30 minutes left with you and instead of instead of myself sitting here guiding
[1:55:54.280 --> 1:55:59.800]  the interview what do you want to get into now Paris I actually I looked to come on your show
[1:55:59.800 --> 1:56:04.280]  and have you got the interview oh absolutely absolutely I mean I mean what I'm saying is
[1:56:04.280 --> 1:56:08.280]  but yeah I've got a million questions but is there anything really eating at you right now
[1:56:08.280 --> 1:56:11.800]  something you want to you know tell millions of people and nothing that you haven't heard
[1:56:11.800 --> 1:56:21.720]  over and over and over again you know um I you know I'm always just just uh I feel good to be
[1:56:21.720 --> 1:56:26.440]  in the presence of people who feel the same for change you know ordinarily when I do interviews
[1:56:26.440 --> 1:56:32.280]  I come on and and you know that there's a there's a pretty strong chance that there'll be adversarial
[1:56:32.280 --> 1:56:37.560]  you know and and to know that I can be a part of a community where people do question what the
[1:56:37.560 --> 1:56:43.320]  government has to say where people look at uh uh you know the events that have taken place
[1:56:44.520 --> 1:56:49.880]  on the day of 9 11 and everything that's occurred since 9 11 and can digest that and know exactly
[1:56:49.880 --> 1:56:55.800]  what's happening I mean it feels good to be a part of that community really well absolutely we all
[1:56:55.800 --> 1:56:59.560]  are you know together in our fight for liberty and speaking of that we're about to come back
[1:56:59.560 --> 1:57:05.640]  and start the next hour uh you know as being what I would call a a black leader not just you know a
[1:57:05.640 --> 1:57:10.760]  uh uh leader of folks that want freedom but particularly a black leader um I mean here's
[1:57:10.760 --> 1:57:15.800]  an example I see on the New York Daily News where that they're grabbing black children the CPS is
[1:57:15.800 --> 1:57:20.520]  and testing pesticide on them till they die and then I ask why aren't black leaders talking about
[1:57:20.520 --> 1:57:26.680]  that so and I don't think anybody knows about that that's my first time hearing of it so there you
[1:57:26.680 --> 1:57:31.560]  go the problem is is that people don't know about it it's not it's disinformation there's a lot of
[1:57:31.560 --> 1:57:36.120]  disinformation out there but there's also just a lot of lack of information you know a lot of
[1:57:36.120 --> 1:57:39.800]  people don't know where to turn and most people do get their news I mean you know most people do
[1:57:39.800 --> 1:57:47.880]  get their information you know wrong as it often is from TV nobody reads you know that I mean it
[1:57:47.880 --> 1:57:53.400]  wouldn't be so easy to pull the wool over America's eyes uh if people read more what is it 9% of the

[2:00:17.400 --> 2:00:22.600]  paris uh four million it's about four million exactly well so now it's four million yeah since
[2:00:22.600 --> 2:00:28.200]  the last time i had you on the show yeah you're also branching out into film making and and producing
[2:00:28.200 --> 2:00:34.520]  films and distributing films are quite a uh eclectic uh group of films the last time i checked
[2:00:35.160 --> 2:00:41.000]  yes yeah that's that's the next uh that's the final frontier for me is to uh branch out of just
[2:00:41.000 --> 2:00:46.040]  doing music alone start start doing films and you know putting out messages in the visual medium
[2:00:46.040 --> 2:00:52.840]  the first uh project is called sounds like a revolution and it'll be out uh third quarter of
[2:00:52.840 --> 2:00:59.720]  next year and it's really it's a film about um you know musicians who who want to make a difference
[2:00:59.720 --> 2:01:08.440]  and and kind of details the consequences uh that we've all faced uh as a result of of our beliefs
[2:01:08.440 --> 2:01:18.120]  in you know this post-911 environment where um you know dissent is stifled and the media outlets
[2:01:18.120 --> 2:01:27.240]  that we have come to rely upon self-censor um it features me and uh uh michael franti and anti flag
[2:01:27.240 --> 2:01:35.160]  and the dixie chicks are in it um henry roland's uh the coup uh i believe it's going to be
[2:01:35.160 --> 2:01:41.240]  narrated by eric abadu it's pretty involved undertake wow yeah so that's one of them you know
[2:01:41.240 --> 2:01:46.760]  another one is uh called nation building which is kind of along the same lines but it's more hip hop
[2:01:46.760 --> 2:01:53.160]  centric and uh you know there are some other films that are kind of already in stages various
[2:01:53.160 --> 2:01:58.360]  stages of completion i don't really want to start films from from the beginning i know
[2:01:59.000 --> 2:02:04.120]  when you make your films you pretty much doing from start to end i'm looking really to buy into
[2:02:04.120 --> 2:02:09.640]  existing films now i understand and that's great let's shift people kind of haven't you know uh
[2:02:09.640 --> 2:02:17.720]  they they're they can't you know finish them because of economics let's let's uh shift gears uh now
[2:02:17.720 --> 2:02:21.560]  now should prospective filmmakers run stuff by us should they email you at garyle funker
[2:02:21.560 --> 2:02:28.040]  send you a trailer absolutely yep please do and uh and you're going to be putting these out on
[2:02:28.040 --> 2:02:33.240]  go ahead um well because ordinarily you know people who uh who are making films most most
[2:02:33.240 --> 2:02:38.440]  people who are independent filmmakers you know have money issues so if they can send that send
[2:02:38.440 --> 2:02:43.480]  send their uh you know their their films and whatever stage of completion that they're in
[2:02:43.480 --> 2:02:47.960]  to us you know how review it and see if we can fit it into what we're doing over here and of course
[2:02:47.960 --> 2:02:53.240]  the message has to be consistent and um you know my film deal is actually with of indy
[2:02:53.240 --> 2:03:00.920]  through universal and the record side is through fontana universal well that is exciting uh so

[2:09:35.080 --> 2:09:40.280]  getting your stuff out that way more and more alternative powerful anti-establishment information
[2:09:40.280 --> 2:09:44.600]  is being allowed out because the old media as you know the establishment media is having
[2:09:44.600 --> 2:09:49.640]  trouble selling their tired old propaganda their products and it's kind of if you can't beat them
[2:09:50.440 --> 2:09:55.960]  join them i'm seeing this everywhere we're even you know i am accepted not on big national tv shows
[2:09:55.960 --> 2:10:02.200]  but on mainline radio international media by liberal conservative journals they're having to
[2:10:02.200 --> 2:10:06.280]  admit that everything i talked about you talked about and others talked about is coming true can
[2:10:06.280 --> 2:10:12.760]  you speak to that the fact that that this struggle of awakening i really see a chance of us turning
[2:10:12.760 --> 2:10:19.240]  the corner here yeah well i agree with you i think that um you know at least in at least
[2:10:19.240 --> 2:10:26.760]  in in in my experience it's it's amazing like i went on hannity and coms and and i was being
[2:10:26.760 --> 2:10:33.240]  broadcast from a satellite i guess you know i got a satellite feed in san francisco because i'm from
[2:10:33.240 --> 2:10:40.360]  the bay area out here in california and uh the people that worked at fox knew the music and were
[2:10:40.360 --> 2:10:45.400]  warm man and and and really embraced the message and they were like man we can't stand working here
[2:10:45.400 --> 2:10:50.520]  which was which was not what i expected i've had seen in fox people behind the scenes tell me the
[2:10:50.520 --> 2:10:55.160]  same thing i've had i've had host call me at the office after i was on a few times and saying
[2:10:55.160 --> 2:11:00.200]  we got record ratings the last two days you were on uh but but you are now banned this wasn't from
[2:11:00.200 --> 2:11:05.880]  programming this was from the business office right from the board said do not put him back on so
[2:11:05.880 --> 2:11:10.840]  exactly we've got the people on the inside more than anybody know when it's all staged yeah and
[2:11:10.840 --> 2:11:16.200]  they you know and and and people just appreciate appreciate it when somebody comes out you know
[2:11:16.200 --> 2:11:23.800]  like you or me comes out and says what needs to be said and and and can can uh put out material
[2:11:23.800 --> 2:11:28.680]  that people can relate to man that reflects their real life existence i think that the the success
[2:11:28.680 --> 2:11:34.520]  that i've had is that i've really kind of taken pains to endear myself to the public so that
[2:11:34.520 --> 2:11:39.880]  that people understand that i really do care you know i mean this is not this is not like a
[2:11:39.880 --> 2:11:45.000]  a fast track to riches doing what we do by any stretch of the oh you've got incredible talent
[2:11:45.000 --> 2:11:49.080]  and had plenty of chances to sell out and i'm not saying i've got some great talent but i've been
[2:11:49.080 --> 2:11:53.400]  approached i mean i've been approached many times but um you know this is this is like uh this is
[2:11:53.400 --> 2:11:57.960]  taking the hard road you know and uh and and sticking with it and remaining consistent man
[2:11:57.960 --> 2:12:02.120]  that's just kind of been my focus does that make it that much sweeter to be as successful as you
[2:12:02.120 --> 2:12:07.640]  are over and over again uh taking the uh taking the road being self-made creating your own
[2:12:07.640 --> 2:12:13.240]  distribution system everything you did of course i mean being able to do what i want to do kind of
[2:12:13.240 --> 2:12:16.600]  when i want to do it and you know to work with the people that i want to work with because
[2:12:16.600 --> 2:12:23.080]  i'm at the stage in my career now where you know i don't i don't want to uh do just anything obviously
[2:12:23.080 --> 2:12:28.600]  i think the the lowest point in my career was producing a tony braxton record i don't know if
[2:12:28.600 --> 2:12:33.160]  you know who that is yeah yeah but it was like i was going through the motions man you know and
[2:12:33.160 --> 2:12:38.600]  and the music was like uh something you would hear in the dentist office and you know to me music
[2:12:38.600 --> 2:12:44.120]  is only really engaging when it moves you you know emotionally well your music certainly
[2:12:44.120 --> 2:12:49.160]  moves me i see it more as poetry uh with the music in the background really well thank you
[2:12:49.160 --> 2:12:54.200]  thank you speaking of the way the world's changing you know i i witnessed urban warfare
[2:12:54.200 --> 2:12:59.000]  trips in the marines and army training to take over our cities arrest our citizens confiscate
[2:12:59.000 --> 2:13:04.200]  our guns and that was the really the wake-up call for me in 96 97 when i physically saw this
[2:13:04.920 --> 2:13:09.000]  and had always heard the stories but then found out it was true and now they're announcing yeah
[2:13:09.000 --> 2:13:14.440]  troops on the streets of america the governors won't be in charge uh the the executive branch
[2:13:14.440 --> 2:13:18.840]  is above congress congress was threatened seven weeks ago with marshal law uh if they didn't go
[2:13:18.840 --> 2:13:23.800]  along with the banker takeover bill uh and i mean i mean it's i think one reason people
[2:13:23.800 --> 2:13:29.640]  are waking up now is because it is it is late in the game and and the establishment is really i mean
[2:13:29.640 --> 2:13:33.640]  the queen of england just abolished the parliament in canada because they were about to throw her
[2:13:33.640 --> 2:13:38.440]  people out and said i am the head of state and and then pulled out her director general that's
[2:13:38.440 --> 2:13:43.080]  in roiders who really is the dictator and so they're even having to admit now the commonwealth
[2:13:43.080 --> 2:13:51.240]  nations never got off them under the queen that's in roiders today can you speak specifically just
[2:13:51.240 --> 2:13:58.280]  to the expanding police state well yeah well you know that the for example the uh the uh
[2:13:58.280 --> 2:14:01.960]  patriot act is not going to be repealed i know that a lot of people thought that that was going
[2:14:01.960 --> 2:14:06.280]  to be the case when obama came in the power and there was going to be like this large cash infusion
[2:14:06.280 --> 2:14:11.320]  in the social programs and you know an immediate pull out of iraq and that kind of stuff and it's
[2:14:11.320 --> 2:14:15.640]  unrealistic to think that that would be the case you know they just said troops for three more years
[2:14:15.640 --> 2:14:21.880]  are going to be there oh really yeah and that yeah they just said yesterday uh three more years and
[2:14:22.680 --> 2:14:29.000]  of the main force of 160 000 and uh then a permanent force of 50 000 basically forever
[2:14:29.000 --> 2:14:33.720]  i think the way that we can frame this moving forward is to look at this this economic downturn
[2:14:33.720 --> 2:14:39.240]  which is which is probably the worst in this country's history it will be yep um as being
[2:14:39.240 --> 2:14:48.120]  the 2008 2009 9 11 financial 9 11 i agree there you go and so when you look at it that way and
[2:14:48.120 --> 2:14:52.680]  you look at you know you say you say a traumatized mind is a susceptible mind like you can you can
[2:14:53.240 --> 2:14:58.040]  mold public perception and and have the public be behind whatever you want them to be behind
[2:14:58.040 --> 2:15:03.480]  when they're traumatized you can look at this this this economic violence being visited on the
[2:15:03.480 --> 2:15:10.040]  american people as having the same effect as 9 11 well again oh i don't even blame obama
[2:15:10.040 --> 2:15:13.880]  he is a complete and total puppet i'm sorry to tell folks just like every other president
[2:15:13.880 --> 2:15:18.280]  since kennedy but he is going to end up they're not going to blame all this on bush even though
[2:15:18.280 --> 2:15:23.080]  he's a puppet as well that's what i'm saying paris they're going to set him up uh the people
[2:15:23.080 --> 2:15:27.800]  really believe he's going to bring change and change things uh it's like bill hick said the
[2:15:27.800 --> 2:15:31.800]  basically take the president in and show him the subruder film and then say any questions
[2:15:31.800 --> 2:15:35.800]  and and and so that's my whole point is i want people to get it out of their heads
[2:15:35.800 --> 2:15:38.920]  that there's going to be any change other than the fact that this guy can string a sentence
[2:15:38.920 --> 2:15:44.520]  together and bush couldn't and this guy is eloquent and you know and has a nice smile uh
[2:15:44.520 --> 2:15:49.880]  yeah i mean he's so it's not as insulting to have obama because you know he is slick and smart
[2:15:49.880 --> 2:15:53.880]  compared to bush up there it's kind of insulting to have this you know monkey up there every day
[2:15:53.880 --> 2:15:58.280]  so with obama it's going to be a lot better but that's it in packaging i mean i guess they're
[2:15:58.280 --> 2:16:02.440]  going to kind of dress themselves up when they rape us instead of you know doing it would just
[2:16:02.440 --> 2:16:08.200]  no clothes on and we're both pessimists so you know i can't even say that i'm cautiously optimistic
[2:16:08.200 --> 2:16:13.640]  anymore i'm just a pessimist about the whole thing and you know hopefully i'll be proven wrong
[2:16:13.640 --> 2:16:17.640]  but chances are i won't be and we'll both still be doing this the few years from now
[2:16:18.520 --> 2:16:22.120]  you know when i can do party music and you can make comedies then we'll all be cool
[2:16:22.120 --> 2:16:29.720]  man i you know actually i would love to make weird documentaries uh you know about
[2:16:30.760 --> 2:16:35.960]  uh subcultures and things and and i'd love to make you know things about nature i'd love to
[2:16:35.960 --> 2:16:41.480]  make documentaries about wales i like wales i like you know who's in there running the shows
[2:16:41.480 --> 2:16:45.400]  looking at me where did you know that there's a whale called the uh uh bowhead whale that lives
[2:16:45.400 --> 2:16:50.600]  about 250 years i do now i mean that it while now i'm looking at my guy and they're looking at me
[2:16:50.600 --> 2:16:55.640]  like a weirdo they're like well no man i that's not weird man you think you think i hate to say
[2:16:55.640 --> 2:16:59.800]  this because it's helically shade what you think i've got the box and i do too man i you know
[2:16:59.800 --> 2:17:05.160]  there's very little in in mainstream media that speaks to me you know and that's why i stay in
[2:17:05.160 --> 2:17:09.320]  my lane doing what i do well i mean the point i was making is that i have all these other thoughts
[2:17:09.320 --> 2:17:13.480]  and other things but you feel like that you know you don't want to waste time with any of that when
[2:17:13.480 --> 2:17:18.440]  there are more urgent things to discuss exactly that's the point is actually i'm sick of this
[2:17:18.440 --> 2:17:23.480]  but the fire in my belly just drives me to do it because i have no future if i don't my family has
[2:17:23.480 --> 2:17:29.160]  no future and so i'm kind of mad like my life's been stolen in a way well yeah and then that
[2:17:29.160 --> 2:17:34.520]  happens once you become enlightened that's the truth is it's difficult to sit by and just
[2:17:34.520 --> 2:17:40.360]  you know uh take what spoon fair to you when you know better exactly i mean that's the point that
[2:17:40.360 --> 2:17:44.280]  i've been making for quite a while now when you know better man and none of this is acceptable
[2:17:44.280 --> 2:17:48.920]  well that's it i mean i would love to take three vacations a year and spend more time with my
[2:17:48.920 --> 2:17:54.280]  family right and i want to and i can't disengage because there's always a hundred more stories
[2:17:54.280 --> 2:17:59.320]  a hundred more crimes a thousand it just it's driving me nuts somebody gotta keep it towards
[2:17:59.320 --> 2:18:05.480]  burning so there it is you have this network set up man don't waste it that's how i look at it i'm
[2:18:05.480 --> 2:18:10.520]  now finally in the driver's seat to be able to reach people globally doing what i do in a way
[2:18:10.520 --> 2:18:14.440]  that is a little bit more comfortable than it's been in the past because i have this this uh
[2:18:14.440 --> 2:18:19.240]  relationship with universal where they manufacture and they distribute everything so you know i i
[2:18:19.240 --> 2:18:25.000]  treated very seriously and i treat each project as though you know i won't as though it's my last
[2:18:25.000 --> 2:18:28.920]  well you know people always look at folks that have been somewhat successful and it's like
[2:18:28.920 --> 2:18:32.200]  even though we're doing good work sometimes they get mad at us and i just say to them hey
[2:18:32.200 --> 2:18:36.840]  i want to see you do well get in there do the decades of hard work and because but
[2:18:36.840 --> 2:18:40.600]  so many people come into this uh the enlightenment movement or whatever you want to call it and
[2:18:40.600 --> 2:18:46.440]  they want instant success does life work that way uh usually uh paris well i you just gotta work for
[2:18:46.440 --> 2:18:51.400]  it like anything else but i do know this i do know that you know there are a lot more there are
[2:18:51.400 --> 2:18:55.640]  there are a lot of hip hop artists and musical uh you know personalities that i want to work with
[2:18:56.200 --> 2:19:01.560]  that are whose abilities i really respect but more often than not what they have to say doesn't
[2:19:01.560 --> 2:19:07.240]  doesn't jive of what i'm doing you know it's like you can't you can't make messages that
[2:19:07.240 --> 2:19:12.840]  are degrading to people and come out on gorilla fuck you just can't do it well and again let's
[2:19:12.840 --> 2:19:17.400]  talk about that in the final segment it's come out as you know in documents and programs that
[2:19:17.400 --> 2:19:22.760]  the establishment wants to put out this degrading message not just in hip hop or rap but in rock
[2:19:22.760 --> 2:19:28.360]  and roll and everything and that's been done by design the cia has been involved in that uh and
[2:19:28.360 --> 2:19:33.400]  and so that's why you see this degrading materialistic mindlessness and that's why it's so refreshing
[2:19:33.400 --> 2:19:37.560]  to see what you're doing paris because it really grabs you in your soul but also
[2:19:37.560 --> 2:19:41.800]  intellectually and it's gonna be through artists such as yourself that we turn the corner on this

[2:25:03.480 --> 2:25:07.080]  i didn't write a note what was the point i said i was going to ask you when we came back it was
[2:25:07.080 --> 2:25:12.360]  something really important you i have no idea i don't either i don't either it'll as soon as you
[2:25:12.360 --> 2:25:16.280]  leave it'll pop back in my head but i had some really important question to ask you but hell
[2:25:16.280 --> 2:25:20.440]  it doesn't matter i'm busy running around behind the scenes line up a bunch of other stuff um
[2:25:21.080 --> 2:25:27.000]  in closing i mean there's so much going on out there what where do you see things going in the
[2:25:27.000 --> 2:25:35.560]  future with so many people waking up uh i you know that who knows who knows man i can only hope
[2:25:35.560 --> 2:25:40.040]  that it doesn't it doesn't get violent and bloody and out of control you know i know that that's
[2:25:40.040 --> 2:25:45.160]  probably that's probably an optimistic statement right there i know that uh things have to change
[2:25:45.160 --> 2:25:48.760]  you know i know that all the wealth can't be maintained by you know such a small portion
[2:25:48.760 --> 2:25:54.600]  of the population i know that things can't remain as unequal as they've been i know that times are
[2:25:54.600 --> 2:25:58.440]  harder than they've ever been and i know that people are going through it man and and you know
[2:25:58.440 --> 2:26:04.040]  there are all of these artificial things in place to keep people in line to keep sheep like sheep
[2:26:04.040 --> 2:26:10.040]  people in line you know uh you know kind of lockstep with what the government has going on
[2:26:10.040 --> 2:26:14.760]  or what the agenda is and you know people are waking up the only real way to make them wake up
[2:26:14.760 --> 2:26:21.560]  though is by doing what we do by hitting them with with information and and uh entertainment
[2:26:22.120 --> 2:26:27.800]  sources that provide information that goes against the grain what they see on tv all day long
[2:26:27.800 --> 2:26:31.080]  absolutely i remember what it was it was uh this is a great segue here at the end
[2:26:31.080 --> 2:26:38.680]  uh government wanting to push mtv in the past choosing what it wanted to push oh right uh i uh
[2:26:38.680 --> 2:26:43.160]  you know talk to so many people in the music industry who say you know something that that
[2:26:43.160 --> 2:26:49.480]  is unpopular but anti-human anti-liberating anti-woman man uh the establishment will push that
[2:26:49.480 --> 2:26:54.520]  while trying to block things that are socially uh responsible but we've seen that happen in hip hop
[2:26:54.520 --> 2:26:58.600]  alone i mean just if i just take hip hop i mean because that's that's obviously my genre and that's
[2:26:58.600 --> 2:27:02.760]  what i started in when i first started in the early nineties the groups were you know me and
[2:27:02.760 --> 2:27:07.160]  public enemy and boogie down productions x clan and all of these groups that reflected
[2:27:07.160 --> 2:27:13.320]  this afrocentric um sensibility that wanted to see the community advance right it wasn't
[2:27:13.320 --> 2:27:17.480]  an anti-white sensibility it was it was something that we're really wanted to see people do better
[2:27:17.480 --> 2:27:25.080]  overall and that those those types of messages have been squashed for the most part and and you
[2:27:25.080 --> 2:27:30.680]  know the the rise against the rap you know we see a direct correlation between the messages and
[2:27:30.680 --> 2:27:35.880]  then the outcomes in our community which just prepares the black males to go into the prison
[2:27:35.880 --> 2:27:42.120]  system of course exactly exactly you know that big business you know in the same way that there
[2:27:42.120 --> 2:27:45.320]  are college towns and i'll have to tell you your listeners is but in the same way that there are
[2:27:45.320 --> 2:27:51.000]  college towns there are towns where the entire you know economy is driven by a prison you know
[2:27:51.000 --> 2:27:56.040]  well take truly a texas where they arrested 56 black people in one month none of them with drugs
[2:27:56.040 --> 2:28:00.120]  with no evidence because the only business in that town was a prison and they put the black

[2:35:48.200 --> 2:35:52.360]  looking at the contracts that were a great deal best of all i've ever been offered and i just uh
[2:35:52.360 --> 2:35:55.800]  didn't even i was trying to finish something having a new baby and it didn't matter but i wanted to
[2:35:55.800 --> 2:35:59.080]  since i couldn't talk to you behind the scenes i wanted to apologize for not getting on the ball
[2:35:59.080 --> 2:36:02.520]  with that but i'll work on that paris and i've been honored to talk to you everybody get acid
[2:36:02.520 --> 2:36:06.600]  reflux and we'll talk to you soon my friend i appreciate it man thank you i'm honored to be
[2:36:06.600 --> 2:36:12.040]  here take care all right there he goes ladies and gentlemen uh yeah great guy look i trust paris
[2:36:12.040 --> 2:36:17.800]  but i'm a little bit scaredy universal and that's just one of the many offers i've had uh and he
[2:36:17.800 --> 2:36:25.240]  brought it up earlier so i went ahead and talked about it i mean i probably had 60 70 offers in
[2:36:25.240 --> 2:36:30.840]  the last 10 years i mean i i i have been in the office in the big glistening building in la
[2:36:30.840 --> 2:36:36.360]  offered a radio show to be as big as rushland ball with the contract in front of me but in that case
[2:36:36.360 --> 2:36:40.200]  i had to be controlled what i said and i said no with the paris thing whatever i wanted say whatever
[2:36:40.200 --> 2:36:45.240]  i wanted and i knew it would put it really out there in a big way and i'd try some other distributions
[2:36:45.240 --> 2:36:50.360]  or another outfit who's a lot smaller and that that was all right uh it's just that then i can't
[2:36:50.360 --> 2:36:56.120]  put them out for free i can't say make copies i can't leave it up on google video and so i you
[2:36:56.120 --> 2:36:59.960]  know turned down tens of millions of dollars that's just how it works here folks and then i get
[2:36:59.960 --> 2:37:05.240]  screamed at and yelled at for trying to sell a few thousand copies myself to be able to maybe
[2:37:05.240 --> 2:37:11.160]  make a film and the films do lose money i pay for stuff with advertising and i pay for it uh you
[2:37:11.160 --> 2:37:15.800]  know a few other ways and i got a small inheritance a few years ago i really want to know side issue
[2:37:15.800 --> 2:37:21.880]  but it doesn't burn me it doesn't get my crawl i feel sorry for people that have no idea how many
[2:37:21.880 --> 2:37:27.320]  deals i've turned down what i've turned down you have no idea i mean most people say they wouldn't
[2:37:27.320 --> 2:37:32.600]  sell out and i'm not saying that would be that if i did it with paris uh it's just that uh
[2:37:33.880 --> 2:37:40.120]  i can't even if something might have some of that involved or or might lead down a road because to me
[2:37:40.120 --> 2:37:48.280]  the fact that i've put out 21 films the fact that i've made 20 myself and i've made 19 and
[2:37:48.280 --> 2:37:55.240]  produced two no i've made 20 and produced two uh the fact that uh they reach hundreds of millions
[2:37:55.240 --> 2:38:02.360]  online for free that that we contract that is what i want instead of money that's what i want
[2:38:03.560 --> 2:38:08.920]  and uh the death threats everything to come with it uh and that would have all pretty much ended
[2:38:08.920 --> 2:38:13.960]  if i uh if i did that so so that so it wasn't selling out that i refused because i could whatever
[2:38:13.960 --> 2:38:20.440]  i wanted i could say uh it was that uh it would be a sell out because the video wouldn't be available
[2:38:20.440 --> 2:38:24.440]  everywhere and but that that's universals in i shouldn't be getting into it but he brought it
[2:38:24.440 --> 2:38:31.000]  up on air so that's out of the bag on that um i'm actually a pretty darn good guys the whole
[2:38:31.000 --> 2:38:36.920]  point here folks i mean i don't know anybody else uh even in this movement i won't take questionable
[2:38:36.920 --> 2:38:42.520]  advertising i won't be involved in any of this stuff um because it doesn't mean anything to me
[2:38:42.520 --> 2:38:47.800]  who i am is what is valuable what i stand for what i believe in i mean i know they've approached
[2:38:47.800 --> 2:38:52.520]  alternative news people alternative health people wanting to buy them out uh and i know a lot of
[2:38:52.520 --> 2:38:57.160]  people out there have said no because you know what they're not going to be involved in poisoning
[2:38:57.160 --> 2:39:01.480]  children but a lot of people will sell out and that's why we've seen a lot of these things happen
[2:39:01.480 --> 2:39:07.880]  uh but that's a side issue they're separately uh paris is somebody who never sold out and has made
[2:39:07.880 --> 2:39:12.280]  it big repeatedly all right i apologize to uh jeffrey r smith we're making him hold five minutes
[2:39:12.280 --> 2:39:16.600]  we're really honored to have him and i've got his bio here but uh i hate to make folks talk about
[2:39:16.600 --> 2:39:20.600]  themselves but it's better if you just describe yourself and introduce yourself we we carry some
[2:39:20.600 --> 2:39:26.200]  of your amazing books and videos seeds of deception genetically engineered foods by jeffrey m smith
[2:39:26.200 --> 2:39:33.320]  keep calling him r smith i'm out of my mind today and uh genetic uh roulette uh also and the gmo
[2:39:33.320 --> 2:39:39.000]  dvd uh film and audio cd trilogy all available at info wars dot com i hope you'll support us and
[2:39:39.000 --> 2:39:45.480]  support him uh by going to info wars dot com and getting those jeffrey m smith good to have you back
[2:39:45.480 --> 2:39:49.800]  with us thank you very much all right great to be here good to have you here you know i never
[2:39:49.800 --> 2:39:55.160]  asked you this have you ever been approached to sell out no i haven't i i've often thought if
[2:39:55.160 --> 2:40:00.920]  monsanto's willing to give me millions of dollars to stop talking about him i could just funnel that
[2:40:00.920 --> 2:40:07.560]  into anti-gmo activities and maybe i'd sell out but no i have never been asked to sell out in any
[2:40:07.560 --> 2:40:12.360]  in any form well that's when you know the new world order is real buddy when they come at you over
[2:40:12.360 --> 2:40:19.880]  and over again so far so far i protected myself in fact i i knew that other people that had written
[2:40:19.880 --> 2:40:24.360]  books before i published seeds of deception some friends of mine published a book against the
[2:40:24.360 --> 2:40:28.600]  grain they're about to publish it and three days before it came off the printer a threatening letter
[2:40:28.600 --> 2:40:34.840]  from monsanto's attorney forced the publisher to stop the presses and cancel the publication so
[2:40:34.840 --> 2:40:39.000]  they were eventually able to print print it somewhere else but i decided to turn down an offer
[2:40:39.560 --> 2:40:43.960]  for by a publisher to publish my books but i could publish it myself because i knew that
[2:40:43.960 --> 2:40:49.320]  they couldn't stop me so it didn't let them yeah that's why i haven't gone with with big film
[2:40:49.320 --> 2:40:54.040]  production companies that have wanted to bring in professional teams all those folks and do tv series
[2:40:54.040 --> 2:40:59.960]  and a bunch of other stuff folks don't know about because exactly by signing on to that then it brings
[2:40:59.960 --> 2:41:05.240]  other people into control and then and then you could lose control yeah there's a lot of people
[2:41:05.240 --> 2:41:10.360]  that've been wanting to uh option my first book see the deception for a film but i'm very cautious
[2:41:10.920 --> 2:41:15.800]  about you know losing the control because they might just flick it so that it may may make
[2:41:15.800 --> 2:41:19.880]  monsanto out to be benevolent well that happened to jessie ventura i think he got like three million
[2:41:19.880 --> 2:41:24.520]  bucks to do a year tv show and msnbc was a three-year contract a couple million a year i'm going from
[2:41:24.520 --> 2:41:27.960]  memory here what he told me in the car he's also talked about it here on air some but when he was
[2:41:27.960 --> 2:41:32.840]  here visiting us and uh they didn't tell him you know it had golden handcuffs in there but he you
[2:41:32.840 --> 2:41:36.680]  know he he did and they said right after he signed it it's like all right now you're out of the game
[2:41:36.680 --> 2:41:41.080]  for the war we're about to have and they just basically bought his contract out and he sat there
[2:41:41.080 --> 2:41:45.560]  for three years and then that's why he finally now was able to go public in the last year and a half
[2:41:45.560 --> 2:41:51.960]  because that contract was up saying he could do no other media so i mean they do it yeah it's true
[2:41:51.960 --> 2:41:58.360]  what i do is um i try like you're getting information out there on on youtube and on my my website
[2:41:58.360 --> 2:42:04.920]  in fact uh just uh four weeks ago i got an email from india saying that uh they found that the
[2:42:04.920 --> 2:42:10.360]  genetically engineered bt cotton is causing massive deaths and reproductive failures in buffalo
[2:42:10.360 --> 2:42:16.360]  and cow and that hundreds or thousands of people in the region who are touching the cotton that's
[2:42:16.360 --> 2:42:20.920]  genetically engineered to produce this toxic pesticide are developing allergic reactions
[2:42:20.920 --> 2:42:27.000]  like itching okay so what i did is i said i said to them please let's document this let's get
[2:42:27.000 --> 2:42:31.400]  it videotaped and so we were able to raise money to get an investigative team in there with a video
[2:42:31.400 --> 2:42:36.760]  camera and two veterinarians and a reporter and a project leader so that that will be able to
[2:42:36.760 --> 2:42:41.240]  be put out for everyone to see what's really happening there absolutely no no let's go back
[2:42:41.240 --> 2:42:44.760]  and i'm really going to try to give you the floor so just you're going to be running here uh what you
[2:42:44.760 --> 2:42:50.280]  think is most important uh the melamine the the estrogen mimicking endocrine disruptors in the
[2:42:50.280 --> 2:42:55.800]  plastics uh the gmo the india situation i mean because you really are one of the leading experts
[2:42:55.800 --> 2:43:00.440]  tell folks who you are then about some of your books and videos we have available at info wars.com
[2:43:00.440 --> 2:43:04.440]  and also on your own side give folks that and and and then you've got the floor sir whatever you
[2:43:04.440 --> 2:43:08.600]  think is most important to tell people because this is a public service announcement is what this is
[2:43:08.600 --> 2:43:12.920]  in the truest sense so people have a chance to know what's in their food in their water
[2:43:12.920 --> 2:43:18.840]  and and ways to try to protect themselves great well my expertise is really on the genetically
[2:43:18.840 --> 2:43:24.600]  engineered foods and crops that's where you take genes from one species and you force them into the
[2:43:24.600 --> 2:43:31.080]  dna of other species causing massive collateral damage in fact in the dna and loss of unpredicted
[2:43:31.080 --> 2:43:38.520]  side effects now these were originally introduced in our food supply widely in 1996 now is because
[2:43:38.520 --> 2:43:43.880]  the first bush administration believed that genetically engineered foods largely produced
[2:43:43.880 --> 2:43:51.000]  from the monsanto company would increase us exports and what happened was they they told
[2:43:51.000 --> 2:43:56.680]  the fda to promote the biotechnology industry the fda then created a new position for michael
[2:43:56.680 --> 2:44:02.360]  taylor monsanto's former attorney and later monsanto's vice president to be in charge of policy
[2:44:02.360 --> 2:44:07.320]  the policy came out with a blatant lie claiming that the agency wasn't aware of any information
[2:44:07.320 --> 2:44:11.400]  showing that gmo's were significantly different different gmo's means genetically modified
[2:44:11.400 --> 2:44:17.480]  organisms as a result of that lie they said no safety studies are necessary come on santo and
[2:44:17.480 --> 2:44:22.440]  others don't even have to tell the fda in order to put these foods on the market well we know now
[2:44:22.440 --> 2:44:29.720]  seven years after that policy came out in 1999 44 000 internal secret numbers from the fda were
[2:44:29.720 --> 2:44:35.080]  made public because of a lawsuit it turns out the overwhelming consensus among the fda's own
[2:44:35.080 --> 2:44:41.160]  scientists were in fact that genetically engineered foods could create allergies toxins new diseases
[2:44:41.160 --> 2:44:46.280]  and nutritional problems that it was different from normal foods and then in fact the scientists
[2:44:46.280 --> 2:44:50.680]  were appalled that it was going to be put on the market quickly and had urged their superiors
[2:44:50.680 --> 2:44:56.520]  like michael taylor to require long-term safety study now i'll say i'll footnote this by saying
[2:44:56.520 --> 2:45:02.360]  michael taylor is now on the obama transition team overseeing agriculture and that that concerns me
[2:45:02.360 --> 2:45:08.120]  although hopefully he's reformed but what's happened since then uh the gmo's have been out
[2:45:08.120 --> 2:45:13.160]  on the market since 1996 there's uh now eight commercialized genetically engineered food
[2:45:13.160 --> 2:45:17.560]  crops we'll go over them in a minute and what i did is in my second book genetic roulette
[2:45:17.560 --> 2:45:25.160]  i documented with help of more than 30 scientists all of the known health risks of gmo's and we've
[2:45:25.160 --> 2:45:31.800]  linked gmo's to thousands of toxic and allergic reactions in humans thousands of six sterile
[2:45:31.800 --> 2:45:37.640]  and dead livestock and damage to virtually every organ in every system studied in animal
[2:45:38.520 --> 2:45:43.240]  and that came out last year but last month two government studies came out which i
[2:45:43.240 --> 2:45:49.640]  blogged about on my huffington post blog and it turns out the an austrian government commission
[2:45:49.640 --> 2:45:57.320]  study showed that uh when mother when parent mice were fed genetically engineered corn which is
[2:45:57.320 --> 2:46:04.440]  currently approved on our diet that it had a reduction in the number of offspring and in
[2:46:04.440 --> 2:46:09.400]  the health of the offspring is judged by the weight of the offspring so it caused a level of
[2:46:09.400 --> 2:46:17.000]  infertility and damage in the next generation and the italian government commission to study which
[2:46:17.000 --> 2:46:22.520]  also came out last month showing that the corn creates an immune response suggesting that it
[2:46:22.520 --> 2:46:29.320]  might create allergies or inflammatory responses or immune responses in humans so we continue to pile
[2:46:29.320 --> 2:46:33.560]  on information showing that genetically engineered foods are unsafe so i realized i didn't really
[2:46:33.560 --> 2:46:39.160]  talk about myself now i can talk about myself in the context of my work um i've been working on
[2:46:39.160 --> 2:46:45.000]  genetically engineered foods for about a dozen years i worked at a gmo detection laboratory
[2:46:45.000 --> 2:46:50.520]  as a vice president of marketing i ran for u.s congress to raise the awareness of the issue
[2:46:50.520 --> 2:46:55.640]  i've published uh seeds of deception and genetic roulette i have a film out which is available
[2:46:55.640 --> 2:47:01.480]  online for free called your milk on drugs just say no another one called hidden dangers and kids
[2:47:01.480 --> 2:47:08.440]  meals and i've been traveling to about 30 countries counseling senior political leaders
[2:47:08.440 --> 2:47:14.760]  speaking to the media and the public about the dangers and more recently my institute for responsible
[2:47:14.760 --> 2:47:20.520]  technology has put together what's called the campaign for healthier eating in america it's
[2:47:20.520 --> 2:47:27.000]  their campaign designed to achieve the consumer rejection tipping point of genetically engineered
[2:47:27.000 --> 2:47:33.880]  foods in the united states and we think we can do this before the end of 2009 now a tipping point
[2:47:33.880 --> 2:47:41.320]  is something where we turn the use of the genetically engineered ingredients into a marketing liability
[2:47:41.880 --> 2:47:47.640]  forcing food companies to take it out of their products or face reduced sale now this happened
[2:47:47.640 --> 2:47:54.200]  with bovine growth hormone genetically modified drug inserted into cows to increase milk supply
[2:47:54.200 --> 2:48:00.200]  we had a kind of a tipping point against rbgh by consumers because of the obvious health dangers
[2:48:00.200 --> 2:48:05.080]  which i'll tell you about in a minute and that occurred about two and a half years ago and since
[2:48:05.080 --> 2:48:11.240]  then uh more and more dairies and retail stores and chains have taken out of their products the
[2:48:11.240 --> 2:48:16.600]  most recent one to take it out with subway they announced it two weeks ago walmart earlier this
[2:48:16.600 --> 2:48:23.640]  year starbucks the end of last year kroger in february even 40 the top yeah even borden's is now
[2:48:23.640 --> 2:48:29.640]  you can't hardly find the growth hormone milk now so this is one area where we're having massive
[2:48:29.640 --> 2:48:34.920]  victories against these global crime cartels this is so exciting what's happening so we're
[2:48:34.920 --> 2:48:42.280]  having victories consumers can vote absolutely in fact we our organization was part of the
[2:48:42.280 --> 2:48:47.800]  group of organizations that engineered this tipping point it wasn't just random we started educating
[2:48:47.800 --> 2:48:54.280]  people about the health risks of the bovine growth hormone the milk itself has more pus it has more
[2:48:54.280 --> 2:49:00.760]  antibiotics it has more growth hormone it also has more of a hormone called insulin like growth
[2:49:00.760 --> 2:49:07.640]  factor one igf one which in high levels in humans can cause candle is linked to cancer
[2:49:07.640 --> 2:49:12.920]  and high rates of fraternal twins and it's in much much higher levels in the milk that comes
[2:49:12.920 --> 2:49:17.640]  from these treated cows that's why we see all these twins suddenly everywhere yeah in fact there
[2:49:17.640 --> 2:49:22.520]  was a study that came out in the journal of uh reproductive medicine where they compared the
[2:49:22.520 --> 2:49:28.920]  fraternal rate twin rate in the united states to the uk now the uk there's a band of the use of
[2:49:28.920 --> 2:49:33.800]  bovine growth hormone in fact it's banned in most industrialized countries in all of europe canada
[2:49:33.800 --> 2:49:39.640]  japan australia new zealand but it was put through in the united states when michael taylor monsanto's
[2:49:39.640 --> 2:49:44.200]  former attorney was in charge of policy it's a monsanto it was a monsanto drug until they sold
[2:49:44.200 --> 2:49:49.160]  it off to elia lily this fall because they saw the writing on the wall that it was going down
[2:49:49.160 --> 2:49:58.280]  um but uh we we know that the that the white paper that michael taylor wrote while he was the deputy
[2:49:58.280 --> 2:50:04.520]  commissioner of policy stated that not only were they not going to lay allow not going to
[2:50:04.520 --> 2:50:12.920]  require labeling of dairy products that contained rbgh they were he was even suggesting that if some
[2:50:12.920 --> 2:50:19.720]  dairy were to label it as rbgh free they should also put the disclaimer that according to the fga
[2:50:19.720 --> 2:50:23.080]  there's no difference well they tried to threaten dairies they tried to threaten dairies as you
[2:50:23.080 --> 2:50:27.800]  know to stop doing that with a bluff just like there's something going on in canada about that
[2:50:27.800 --> 2:50:31.560]  and it's not stay there when we come back we're gonna talk about this but the key here is with the
[2:50:31.560 --> 2:50:37.480]  estrogen hormones in the in the mimickers in the milk in the plastic we can have a tipping point
[2:50:37.480 --> 2:50:43.960]  we can have a tipping point on the melamine on all of it we'll be right back silver is mankind's

[2:53:51.400 --> 2:53:57.960]  preeminent experts on gmo and not just gmo foods but the policies around the world and the fight
[2:53:57.960 --> 2:54:04.280]  against them overwhelmingly in every poll it's 85-95-99 some polls against these people know
[2:54:04.280 --> 2:54:08.600]  they're bad especially the cross species genetically modified organisms where they put cockroach
[2:54:08.600 --> 2:54:12.920]  genes and tomatoes or for some reason they use the cockroaches one of the favorites is such old
[2:54:12.920 --> 2:54:22.760]  genetics or in salmon I mean pig genes human genes and pigs approving cloned milk approving
[2:54:22.760 --> 2:54:27.240]  cloned animals milk from cloned animals the list just goes on and on we're gonna go back to him

[2:54:33.800 --> 2:54:39.960]  bookstore shopping cart and get seeds of deception seeds of deception by jeff ream smith exposing
[2:54:39.960 --> 2:54:43.400]  industry and government lies about the safety genetically engineered foods you're eating
[2:54:43.400 --> 2:54:48.520]  seeds of deception exposing expose by jeff ream smith documents significant health dangers
[2:54:48.520 --> 2:54:53.240]  and genetically modified GM foods and the intense industry influence of political corruption these
[2:54:53.240 --> 2:54:59.640]  are well done like like textbooks but beautiful color pages I mean just lavish very easy to
[2:54:59.640 --> 2:55:05.720]  understand but all the scientific data they have the we have a deadly gamble combo that has the two
[2:55:05.720 --> 2:55:14.040]  books and the two films with the audio CD in fact for what is it 1995 we have the GMO trilogy dvd
[2:55:14.040 --> 2:55:19.640]  CD set that's probably the best deal and most people don't read they watch things three disc set
[2:55:19.640 --> 2:55:23.480]  that explains why GMO's genetically modified organisms threaten your health the environment
[2:55:23.480 --> 2:55:31.000]  and future generations give this this christmas instead of a GMO fruitcake or GMO cotton shirt
[2:55:31.000 --> 2:55:37.880]  that it's got all sorts of poisons leaching into you I mean seriously folks go to info wars.com and
[2:55:37.880 --> 2:55:41.880]  support the alternative media but more importantly educate yourself your friends and family learn
[2:55:41.880 --> 2:55:48.600]  how to identify these approvingly very dangerous creations that we're eating and consuming and
[2:55:48.600 --> 2:55:55.000]  wearing that info wars.com genetic roulette of the GMO trilogy and the deadly gamble combo with all
[2:55:55.000 --> 2:56:00.680]  of them in it and then of course seeds of deception this is a short segment but let's continue sir
[2:56:00.680 --> 2:56:05.880]  with where you left off about tipping points we're having victory after victory worldwide
[2:56:05.880 --> 2:56:11.560]  when we're actually able to reach out and educate the public this is very encouraging absolutely
[2:56:11.560 --> 2:56:16.920]  with genetically modified foods the tipping point of consumer rejection in europe happened in
[2:56:16.920 --> 2:56:24.120]  april of 1999 because there is high-profile media coverage on the food safety aspects of GMOs
[2:56:24.120 --> 2:56:28.040]  as a result within a single week virtually every major food company
[2:56:28.040 --> 2:56:33.000]  committed to stop using GM ingredients for the european brand so the tipping point caused the
[2:56:33.000 --> 2:56:38.680]  swift rejection of GMOs there now what's needed here in order to create the tipping point are two
[2:56:38.680 --> 2:56:45.160]  fundamental pieces the first is knowledge of the health dangers of GMOs and the second is information
[2:56:45.160 --> 2:56:49.800]  on how to avoid them so we have a new non-gmo shopping guide and i'll be happy to link that over
[2:56:49.800 --> 2:56:55.560]  to info wars i'll deal with that after after the show plug your side plug your side people should
[2:56:55.560 --> 2:57:00.600]  buy it right now plug it okay they can do they could it's actually free uh to look at and you
[2:57:00.600 --> 2:57:05.160]  can also buy it at cost and bundles of 50 so you can give it out to your friends good so it's free
[2:57:05.160 --> 2:57:09.320]  online where you can print it off but i recommend buying it in bundles that saves the work in the
[2:57:09.320 --> 2:57:16.760]  time yes yes so responsible technology dot org responsible technology dot org you can go to
[2:57:16.760 --> 2:57:22.120]  our shopping guide the non-gmo shopping guide you can look at it online you can print it out
[2:57:22.120 --> 2:57:27.560]  but we also we we can ship it we recommend getting these brochures that are also talk about the gmo
[2:57:27.560 --> 2:57:33.320]  health risks when you give them out together the health risks brochures tells people why to avoid
[2:57:33.320 --> 2:57:40.920]  GMOs and the non-gmo shopping guide tells people how very simple very simple only 14 pages long
[2:57:40.920 --> 2:57:46.520]  very well done everybody should get these what it does is what we're asking doctors to give it
[2:57:46.520 --> 2:57:51.320]  out as patient education materials we're asking religions to give it out to their congregations
[2:57:51.320 --> 2:57:55.800]  parent teacher organizations to give it out to children so that all the parents know what to buy
[2:57:55.800 --> 2:58:01.080]  and also it's being made available for free through natural food stores as well and there's a new film
[2:58:01.080 --> 2:58:05.720]  and there's a new film out available the world according to monsanto we're gonna be back in

[3:00:15.560 --> 3:00:21.480]  the estrogen endocrine disruptors that are in many types of plastic and how it's being changed
[3:00:21.480 --> 3:00:28.360]  worldwide but we haven't reached the tipping point here yet but this new film tell us about the world
[3:00:28.360 --> 3:00:36.200]  according come on santa well this is an amazing film i think that if this film was widely seen in
[3:00:36.200 --> 3:00:41.480]  the united states the tipping point would follow soon after so we're actually recommending for
[3:00:41.480 --> 3:00:47.800]  individuals to host home showing parties and to host free public showings and we have hand out
[3:00:47.800 --> 3:00:53.080]  materials that you can give to people after they see this film because of the level of outrage and
[3:00:53.080 --> 3:00:59.880]  the level of motivation to be anti-gmo campaigner is greater in the 30 minutes after seeing the film
[3:00:59.880 --> 3:01:05.720]  the world according to monsanto than any time in a person's life it just it shows first of all the
[3:01:05.720 --> 3:01:12.920]  background of this company monsanto whose intention is to replace nature with its genetically engineered
[3:01:12.920 --> 3:01:17.960]  patented creation and they brag i mean i mean tell the listeners they brag that they mean
[3:01:17.960 --> 3:01:22.600]  to take everything over so then we don't have a choice no it's definitely true i talked to
[3:01:22.600 --> 3:01:29.080]  someone who had come and come back in 1999 from a conference where arthur anison consulting who
[3:01:29.080 --> 3:01:34.040]  had been monsanto's consultant they were also and runs a consultant of course they had bragged about
[3:01:34.040 --> 3:01:39.560]  that i had worked with the monsanto executives first asking them to describe their ideal future
[3:01:39.560 --> 3:01:45.720]  in 15 to 20 years and the executives described the world in which 100 of all commercial seeds
[3:01:45.720 --> 3:01:50.440]  in the world were genetically engineered and patented and anison consulting worked backwards
[3:01:50.440 --> 3:01:57.000]  from that goal to create the strategy and tactics to achieve it and so their intention is to replace
[3:01:57.000 --> 3:02:02.520]  our food with nature now i've talked to a number of people who used to work in monsanto one person
[3:02:02.520 --> 3:02:08.760]  i spoke to this year he said about the bovine growth hormone that changes our milk he said the
[3:02:08.760 --> 3:02:16.760]  three scientists that he talked to who were doing the actual food safety studies on the drug themselves
[3:02:16.760 --> 3:02:21.080]  switched to organic milk which doesn't allow the drug because they were concerned about the
[3:02:21.080 --> 3:02:27.160]  potential influence on their health of increased levels of igf one which is linked to cancer he
[3:02:27.160 --> 3:02:32.360]  also told me that other scientists were indicating that they had found adverse effects of feeding
[3:02:32.360 --> 3:02:36.760]  their genetically engineered crops to rodents i don't know if it was mice or rats and we're
[3:02:36.760 --> 3:02:43.880]  trying to figure out how to describe it in such a way that the adverse impacts were not apparent
[3:02:43.880 --> 3:02:50.360]  to anyone who might look at the study so this is the and another person told me that he he was
[3:02:50.360 --> 3:02:56.280]  originally recruited to go to monsanto by and and he looked at online or he looked at the
[3:02:56.280 --> 3:03:03.560]  documents that were done by the former ceo robert chipiro of monsanto that that glowed about the
[3:03:03.560 --> 3:03:08.520]  positive impacts of genetic engineering for health and feeding the world and all that so he decided
[3:03:08.520 --> 3:03:15.720]  to take the job and when he was in st louis he actually stood up at a meeting of all these new
[3:03:15.720 --> 3:03:20.200]  recruits and said and describe all these great things that robert chipiro wanted for the world
[3:03:20.200 --> 3:03:24.200]  and how great it was that they're working for genetic engineering he was pulled aside after
[3:03:24.200 --> 3:03:29.960]  the meeting by a vice president of monsanto and he told me that the vice president said to him
[3:03:29.960 --> 3:03:35.240]  now wait a minute what my what robert chipiro says is one thing what we do is something else
[3:03:35.240 --> 3:03:39.880]  he's the face man who tells a story we don't even understand what he's talking about we're here to
[3:03:39.880 --> 3:03:45.640]  make money then he discovered that the genetically engineered cotton that was being fed to the gary
[3:03:45.640 --> 3:03:50.440]  cows down the street from him that was from monsanto's field trials that it had a potentially
[3:03:50.440 --> 3:03:56.120]  dangerous protein that had been the result of this kind of random primitive way that they
[3:03:56.120 --> 3:04:01.240]  genetically engineer crops he tried to complain and say this could be endangering the cows
[3:04:01.240 --> 3:04:06.920]  and the food supply and no one in the company listened instead they ostracized them he tried
[3:04:06.920 --> 3:04:12.280]  to blow the whistle to government officials in california to university professors no one listened
[3:04:12.280 --> 3:04:17.320]  to him so he left the company saying he's not going to be part of this disaster and that's covered
[3:04:17.320 --> 3:04:21.480]  in the film long segment coming up plenty of time to get into this and the big key here and we'll
[3:04:21.480 --> 3:04:25.720]  talk to jeff ryan spend the bottles when we get back because this is a fight for our lives there
[3:04:25.720 --> 3:04:30.840]  are hundreds of gmo foods but what eight or nine big main staple croppings they're about to go into
[3:04:30.840 --> 3:04:36.120]  hundreds and hundreds where basically everything will be gmo so we either stop it now it's already
[3:04:36.120 --> 3:04:40.920]  been devastating to all of us a lot of us are gonna probably already die from this or they take over
[3:04:42.680 --> 3:04:47.800]  alex jones here with a question what does humidity mean to you most people think of hot and sticky

[3:08:39.800 --> 3:08:44.920]  powerful story uh jeffery and smith tell folks uh where they can get it i know monsanto film
[3:08:44.920 --> 3:08:50.600]  dot com monsanto film dot com uh the people's lives depend on this and i want to be clear here
[3:08:52.120 --> 3:08:56.200]  uh i mean i'm somebody who does my research when i was first on air 13 years ago i was more of a
[3:08:56.200 --> 3:09:01.160]  mainline but only for about a year kind of libertarian ron paul conservative and i still
[3:09:01.160 --> 3:09:06.120]  have a many issues but uh ron paul now is concerned about gmo because he's researching he's a medical
[3:09:06.120 --> 3:09:11.640]  doctor i over the years went and read the case studies i had Nobel prize winners on i had executives
[3:09:11.640 --> 3:09:16.120]  and genetic engineers who headed up companies made millions a year who where their rats would die
[3:09:16.120 --> 3:09:20.760]  or their rats would be sterile or the animals would get sick and they would go say we've got to
[3:09:20.760 --> 3:09:25.560]  go back and fix this they'd say no because they fire with these gene guns in randomly and get
[3:09:25.560 --> 3:09:29.960]  mutations and then take the mutation they like and breed it there's a lot of stuff science the
[3:09:29.960 --> 3:09:37.640]  point is i have done oh probably 300 400 500 hours i probably read 20 books on the subject probably
[3:09:37.640 --> 3:09:44.200]  watched 20 30 films hundreds of talks had hundreds of guests on uh jeff riam smith is
[3:09:44.200 --> 3:09:48.600]  one of the leading figures in fighting this one of the most successful he is very conservative
[3:09:48.600 --> 3:09:53.480]  and he'll admit that uh it's it's frankly far worse than he's even saying let me explain something to
[3:09:54.120 --> 3:09:59.400]  this is devastating us there's a reason that one in three has cancer from one in 33 now
[3:09:59.400 --> 3:10:03.880]  just 50 years ago there's a reason diabetes is up several thousand percentage points there's a reason
[3:10:03.880 --> 3:10:08.040]  the sperm counts down by 80 plus percent on average there's a reason women are infertile
[3:10:08.040 --> 3:10:12.920]  there's a reason melamine and and and and all of this uh separate from genetic engineering is
[3:10:12.920 --> 3:10:19.160]  hurting us and aspartame uh and i will tell you it's by design is eugenics i mean it's like
[3:10:19.160 --> 3:10:23.400]  bare pharmaceutical shipping on over a million doses of factor eight every one of them filled
[3:10:23.400 --> 3:10:27.640]  with hiv and hepatitis a b and c knowing it would kill everybody that got it or make them very ill
[3:10:27.640 --> 3:10:34.360]  you know that's on record now even on msnbc this is real you need to get this film uh jeff riam smith
[3:10:34.360 --> 3:10:40.920]  though where's the best place for folks to get it well online monsantofilm.com is the way to get
[3:10:40.920 --> 3:10:46.040]  it um it'll be on your site i'm sure very soon yeah i'm going to carry it you know you'll be
[3:10:46.040 --> 3:10:50.040]  getting it soon from us i think you put an order in today but um monsanto the the world
[3:10:50.040 --> 3:10:54.200]  according to monsanto i gotta give you the backstory in this i've been interviewed dozens of times
[3:10:54.200 --> 3:11:00.360]  for uh by filmmakers about 14 film crews have come to my little town in iowa and i got a call
[3:11:00.360 --> 3:11:06.280]  from this french woman uh marie monique robin uh and you know it was it was kind of standard for me
[3:11:06.280 --> 3:11:12.360]  to start giving filmmakers the background about gmo's and who to speak to and what the story was
[3:11:12.360 --> 3:11:18.360]  and the disc the discrediting and the disruptions and the deception it turns out she had been studying
[3:11:18.360 --> 3:11:26.840]  this so solidly for so many months she knew more than any other filmmaker i had ever spoken with
[3:11:27.560 --> 3:11:32.280]  in fact more than most anti-gmo activists that i've seen around the world in my 30 countries of
[3:11:32.280 --> 3:11:38.520]  travel she was so well prepared and she was going to visit the people that i had just written about
[3:11:38.520 --> 3:11:44.600]  all over the world all over the country and so i was excited about this film i actually went to paris
[3:11:44.600 --> 3:11:49.720]  and saw the the run through of the of the film before it was done and arranged to have it available
[3:11:49.720 --> 3:11:55.240]  in the united states because i did not want it to be um you know yeah it's very well done it's very
[3:11:55.240 --> 3:11:59.720]  well done oh it's incredible it's incredible at least people absolutely shaking one one reviewer
[3:11:59.720 --> 3:12:05.560]  said you will freeze the blood in your vein and what it does is it it talks about the history of
[3:12:05.560 --> 3:12:11.240]  monsanto and all of the dealings that they had with agent orange and the lies and the apparently
[3:12:11.240 --> 3:12:16.600]  rigged research and dumping toxic waste dumping toxic waste in poor neighborhoods and earlier i
[3:12:16.600 --> 3:12:21.240]  didn't finish my point i ever do and just briefly what i'm saying is i didn't believe that gmail was
[3:12:21.240 --> 3:12:26.120]  bad i bought the propaganda that it was going to save everybody and feed the world went in truth
[3:12:26.120 --> 3:12:31.320]  that actually destroys farmers and is designed so they're dependent so agribusiness could take over
[3:12:31.320 --> 3:12:37.240]  so my point is i really researched this and found out that that i was wrong uh the 13 years ago but
[3:12:37.240 --> 3:12:42.680]  go ahead no and exactly what happens with people is that there's so much money's been spent on
[3:12:42.680 --> 3:12:46.520]  convincing people that it's going to feed the world when they realize how dangerous it is that
[3:12:46.520 --> 3:12:51.720]  the average gm crop reduces yield that it actually destroys farmers it's quite a wake-up call and
[3:12:51.720 --> 3:12:57.000]  this comes out in this beautiful film it taught we talked to someone from the epa whose colleague
[3:12:57.000 --> 3:13:03.320]  was basically trashed when she discovered apparently rigged research by monsanto uh we talked to a
[3:13:03.320 --> 3:13:09.160]  whistleblower at the fda who lost his job when he tried to get proper studies done on bovine growth
[3:13:09.160 --> 3:13:15.560]  hormone uh there's it shows how monsanto's claims that their roundup herbicide is biodegradable
[3:13:15.560 --> 3:13:21.160]  was declared false and illegal by judges in two countries how there's possible cancer effects it
[3:13:21.160 --> 3:13:27.400]  was being covered up bob about their herbicide and each time when this is discovered somehow
[3:13:27.400 --> 3:13:33.480]  monsanto gets the upper hand and stifles the research and ends up booting out the researcher
[3:13:33.480 --> 3:13:39.880]  or keeping him quiet now with gmo this is all a lead-up to gmo's which is much worse than the
[3:13:39.880 --> 3:13:45.400]  agent on the dbt the pcb's and aniston where they said they didn't want to lose a dollar of business
[3:13:45.400 --> 3:13:49.720]  so they weren't going to inform the people locally that they were being poisoned year after year
[3:13:49.720 --> 3:13:55.560]  but the gmo's is absolutely the worst and is it the the work that this this movie does it makes
[3:13:55.560 --> 3:14:03.640]  it absolutely clear that it was political collusion industry manipulation lies and deception that allowed
[3:14:03.640 --> 3:14:08.440]  these very dangerous genetically engineered crops in fact there was one point where she's doing this
[3:14:08.440 --> 3:14:14.440]  rare interview with the former fda pro biotech manager and he's trying to argue for the safety
[3:14:14.440 --> 3:14:19.080]  of gmo's saying there's absolutely no question that these foods are safe and then she pulls out
[3:14:19.080 --> 3:14:25.960]  from her own notes a 1991 memo in which he himself admitted that gmo that the genetically
[3:14:25.960 --> 3:14:31.160]  modern genetic modification might have been responsible for a deadly epidemic in the 1980s
[3:14:31.160 --> 3:14:35.720]  that killed about a hundred americans and caused five ten thousand to fall sick from a genetically
[3:14:35.720 --> 3:14:39.880]  engineered food supplement called el tryptophan and he was like humming and hawing he just caught
[3:14:39.880 --> 3:14:46.040]  absolutely off guard not realizing that this woman has done her studies done her research
[3:14:46.040 --> 3:14:51.800]  it all he she also talks to dr arport poos tie from scotland i think he's been on your show he's
[3:14:51.800 --> 3:14:58.120]  he actually um was fired from his job after 35 years and silenced with threats of a lawsuit when
[3:14:58.120 --> 3:15:03.240]  he found that genetically engineered crops are inherently dangerous and caused massive damage
[3:15:03.240 --> 3:15:07.800]  to rats that were fed a genetically engineered potato and by the way he was the head guy he was
[3:15:07.800 --> 3:15:13.720]  the head guy there yeah he was actually he was the guy that had been given three million dollar grant
[3:15:13.720 --> 3:15:19.640]  by the u k government to create the ideal testing protocol for gmo that was going to be instituted
[3:15:19.640 --> 3:15:25.000]  into e u law and he had been studying it you know with a team of about 20 or 30 people in three
[3:15:25.000 --> 3:15:30.040]  different institutes so he was like the leading person in the world doing the most official
[3:15:30.040 --> 3:15:35.560]  research on gmo's and was canned because he discovered that they were bad now when he went
[3:15:35.560 --> 3:15:41.000]  public with his concerns initially he was a hero at his prestigious institute but then allegedly
[3:15:41.000 --> 3:15:47.320]  montanto called clinton or someone at the white house someone at the white house called blare
[3:15:47.320 --> 3:15:53.080]  and someone from from the prime minister's office in the u k phone the director of the institute
[3:15:53.080 --> 3:15:58.760]  where this guy worked and the next morning he was fired from his job and by the way he he was at
[3:15:58.760 --> 3:16:03.320]  top uh i'm a genetic engineer he told me on air several times he believed in it he wanted it to
[3:16:03.320 --> 3:16:09.000]  work but he couldn't engage in mass murder absolutely he was concerned because he realized
[3:16:09.000 --> 3:16:14.520]  that the potatoes that had caused such damage and they caused potentially pre cancer spell growth
[3:16:14.520 --> 3:16:19.320]  molar brains livers and testicles partial atrophy of the liver damaged immune system i mean these
[3:16:19.320 --> 3:16:24.840]  this is after 10 days of being a genetic engineer crop i mean he realized that if his if his potatoes
[3:16:24.840 --> 3:16:30.680]  had been submitted to the same flimsy superficial terrible research safety studies that that had
[3:16:30.680 --> 3:16:35.080]  gotten other products in the market the potatoes would have flown onto the market and assumed
[3:16:35.080 --> 3:16:42.120]  to say i want to stop you i want to stop you in 10 days in rats in rodents which they study because
[3:16:42.120 --> 3:16:46.440]  physiologically or the weather metabolic system works they're the closest to humans
[3:16:46.440 --> 3:16:50.840]  uh next to pigs but rats are cheaper uh and from the scientists i've talked to you that's not my
[3:16:50.840 --> 3:16:56.680]  opinion that's a fact uh that's why they test mice and rats and other rodents skinny pigs uh
[3:16:56.680 --> 3:17:02.840]  that in 10 days devastating effects i mean this is an imagine we're all eating other stuff like
[3:17:02.840 --> 3:17:08.040]  this right now you know even there's some studies that didn't get on to this world according to
[3:17:08.040 --> 3:17:13.240]  my standards she got a lot of beautiful stuff on uh but there was this woman a senior scientist at
[3:17:13.240 --> 3:17:18.600]  the russian national academy of sciences who fed rats genetically engineered soy that we do eat
[3:17:19.160 --> 3:17:25.560]  the mother rats and more than half of the offspring died within three weeks and compared to only one
[3:17:25.560 --> 3:17:30.520]  out of 10 death rate when the mothers were eating non-genetically engineered ladies and gentlemen
[3:17:30.520 --> 3:17:35.720]  you understand we're eating this this is deadly that's why there's i mean i was talking to a
[3:17:35.720 --> 3:17:39.720]  medical doctor the other day she talked about how when she was going to the albert einstein medical
[3:17:39.720 --> 3:17:45.320]  institution i talked to hybrid medicals as well you know we were graduating 30 40 years ago they
[3:17:45.320 --> 3:17:50.840]  would if there was a child in the ward that had cancer it was like going to look at you know you
[3:17:50.840 --> 3:17:56.280]  know the last right whale i mean it was so rare that it was like oh my god and now there's just
[3:17:56.280 --> 3:18:01.000]  kids all around me my neighborhood dying people dying everywhere oh so i mean it's a this is a
[3:18:01.000 --> 3:18:07.720]  holocaust you know it's interesting this particular scientist she was harassed she was set up in
[3:18:07.720 --> 3:18:11.800]  the tax they had she came to her office once and there was a paper that had been burned on her desk
[3:18:11.800 --> 3:18:17.640]  she had samples stolen and she was eventually taken off the ability to do any more gmo research
[3:18:17.640 --> 3:18:23.560]  because her director was pressured by his director so another scientist at this institute went up to
[3:18:23.560 --> 3:18:29.320]  her and tried to cut to comfort her by actually saying well maybe the genetically engineered
[3:18:29.320 --> 3:18:36.200]  so i will solve the overpopulation problem on the earth oh they were supposed to comfort her
[3:18:37.160 --> 3:18:41.800]  now another team in in italy stop stop stop stop sir this is too i gotta have you back next this
[3:18:41.800 --> 3:18:46.120]  is too incredible and we're running out of time we've got one then before this break in is a segment
[3:18:47.080 --> 3:18:51.960]  specifically the name of this lady where this was oh don't worry the overpopulation
[3:18:51.960 --> 3:18:56.200]  because i've actually found sir it's all by design i know you don't go that far you stick with the
[3:18:56.200 --> 3:19:00.840]  you know this area but but but it always comes up go back to that little story a little more
[3:19:00.840 --> 3:19:07.080]  specifics sure sure all right her name is dr arena ermacoba and uh there was an interesting
[3:19:07.080 --> 3:19:12.280]  thing about her about her research she had she had done this research three times when she said
[3:19:12.280 --> 3:19:19.640]  mother uh rat genetically engineered soy and each time is a huge death rate and also smaller
[3:19:19.640 --> 3:19:24.760]  offspring really run like offspring and uh a very interesting twist happened
[3:19:24.760 --> 3:19:27.560]  after she did her three research studies which i'll tell you about after the break
[3:19:28.120 --> 3:19:31.800]  what i'm gonna do because the interest of time i'm gonna skip this break for the internet
[3:19:31.800 --> 3:19:36.920]  blasters and video folks watching at prison planet dot tv and we'll come back and get into
[3:19:36.920 --> 3:19:43.800]  all the other areas when we return time is too valuable stay with us now that the election

[3:24:28.040 --> 3:24:37.720]  there can't be a scene with me and i'm getting real shot down and i'm feeling me
[3:24:39.640 --> 3:24:47.000]  no more with the nice guy hey the globalists are not nice guys and we need to stop being
[3:24:47.000 --> 3:24:52.520]  nice guys right back to them all right finishing up jeff ryanow it's a little bit
[3:24:52.520 --> 3:24:57.320]  skill to when i got behind the scenes talking when we come back you were finishing up with these these
[3:24:57.320 --> 3:25:04.760]  these rats that have been bred together that had been fed gmo the embryos themselves were a different
[3:25:04.760 --> 3:25:11.480]  genetics finish up with that and then and then and then recap in any more specifics you've got
[3:25:11.480 --> 3:25:15.640]  about she goes to them and they say you know she's a she's a strut and they say don't worry this
[3:25:15.640 --> 3:25:21.240]  will contribute to world overpopulation which of course she was compartmentalized she she wasn't told
[3:25:21.240 --> 3:25:24.840]  that that was the whole point i know you won't go that far i will i've made the film in game
[3:25:24.840 --> 3:25:29.320]  blueprint for global enslavement then let's get into the 64 billion dollar or trillion dollar
[3:25:29.320 --> 3:25:36.440]  question uh the fight is now they are proliferating gmo into everything and now is the time to stop
[3:25:36.440 --> 3:25:41.240]  them go ahead absolutely all right let's just talk about the reproductive issues because there's
[3:25:41.240 --> 3:25:47.080]  more about reproduction and this and the failure of of animals who've been fed gmo's to reproduce
[3:25:47.080 --> 3:25:51.880]  it's actually not just in the laboratory we're seeing it among livestock and i'll show you i'll
[3:25:51.880 --> 3:25:57.000]  tie it all together right now so we left off with arena ermikova it was at the EU parliament
[3:25:57.000 --> 3:26:02.360]  offices i we had just given a talk and she tells me that she can't do any more studies because
[3:26:02.360 --> 3:26:06.360]  um they've been she's been taken off the job and that someone tried to comfort her
[3:26:06.360 --> 3:26:11.560]  saying that maybe it'll solve the overpopulation problem now at that at that conference she also
[3:26:11.560 --> 3:26:17.960]  showed a slide of testicles of rats that were fed genetically engineered soy and compared to
[3:26:17.960 --> 3:26:22.600]  the testicles of rats that were fed regular soy the testicles of rats that were fed regular soy
[3:26:22.600 --> 3:26:29.800]  were pink those that were fed GM soy were blue a completely different color they showed she
[3:26:29.800 --> 3:26:35.960]  showed slides of the cells they were completely different structure in mice in italy they were
[3:26:35.960 --> 3:26:40.200]  fed genetically engineered soy from a different group they looked under an electron microscope
[3:26:40.200 --> 3:26:46.120]  and found damage in the small and in the in the young sperm cells associated with the mice that
[3:26:46.120 --> 3:26:51.720]  were fed genetically engineered soy they looked into the DNA or the cells of the embryos from the
[3:26:51.720 --> 3:26:57.160]  offspring of mice that were fed GM soy and they function differently there's a temporary disruption
[3:26:57.160 --> 3:27:02.760]  in the production of RNA from the DNA in these mice compared to when the mothers were and fathers
[3:27:02.760 --> 3:27:09.800]  were fed non GM soy now let's we fast forward to last month and mice that were fed corn that
[3:27:09.800 --> 3:27:16.120]  was genetically engineered also showed infertility issues and damage in the offspring now we look
[3:27:16.120 --> 3:27:22.200]  at what's happened in Iowa and around the world around the country a few years ago when certain
[3:27:22.200 --> 3:27:29.560]  varieties of genetically engineered corn appeared to be causing sterility in pigs and cow i talked
[3:27:29.560 --> 3:27:34.760]  to one farmer jerry roseman and he said you know he tried everything couldn't figure out what was
[3:27:34.760 --> 3:27:40.440]  going on and then he found some other people that also had sterility and their pigs and it turns out
[3:27:40.440 --> 3:27:45.960]  they were feeding the same genetically engineered corn so he went to the company garsk and said
[3:27:45.960 --> 3:27:50.920]  your corn they went as a group to the all three of them and said your corn may be causing our pigs
[3:27:50.920 --> 3:27:57.640]  to become sterile so they gave him a sample of corn and they the garsk never got back to him so
[3:27:57.640 --> 3:28:01.880]  they had uh one of the garsk reps called the headquarters and he said you're never going
[3:28:01.880 --> 3:28:06.760]  to believe this jeffrey jerry they lost your sample so they claimed that they lost the sample
[3:28:06.760 --> 3:28:11.320]  it's their jerry calling back says don't worry i've been saving 20 000 bushels of corn to do
[3:28:11.320 --> 3:28:17.000]  research on you're welcome to come to get more and they never did when he hit the papers a year later
[3:28:17.000 --> 3:28:21.560]  garsk immediately went on television and the radio and papers and said we've done our studies and it
[3:28:21.560 --> 3:28:27.960]  wasn't the corn the same study that's supposedly on this missing sample every time it was broadcast
[3:28:27.960 --> 3:28:33.320]  on radio television or newspaper or magazine jerry would get more calls from more farmers
[3:28:33.320 --> 3:28:39.160]  that said you know i'm having the same problem he no one was able no one was willing to do the
[3:28:39.160 --> 3:28:45.880]  research on his corn to see if that was causing the problem in fact supposedly a usda or a
[3:28:45.880 --> 3:28:50.680]  university group was going to get together and try and create a study that was specifically
[3:28:50.680 --> 3:28:55.080]  designed to disprove that it was the corn because they weren't even going to test his corn well he
[3:28:55.080 --> 3:29:00.840]  had to do his own study and he took his own corn and he fed it to his his cows and his bulls and
[3:29:00.840 --> 3:29:09.080]  immediately they got sterile also and and there's more well this is this is the biggest story
[3:29:09.080 --> 3:29:15.320]  let's come back in our final segment with you jeffrey smith and again talk about the proliferation
[3:29:15.880 --> 3:29:21.080]  of all of these systems and and how we stop it and of course humans are also becoming sterile
[3:29:21.080 --> 3:29:27.480]  or infertile right in line with the other mammals that are eating this ladies and gentlemen this
[3:29:27.480 --> 3:29:38.760]  is by design make no mistake we're on the march the empires on the run alex jones and the gcn radio
[3:29:38.760 --> 3:29:46.600]  network doctors around the world claim that cancer and other diseases cannot live in a ph
[3:29:46.600 --> 3:29:51.880]  balanced alkaline environment but as you know most people are overly acidic due to stress acidic
[3:29:51.880 --> 3:29:57.160]  diet and lack of exercise ph balance is the foundation of energy abundance and perfect health
[3:29:57.160 --> 3:30:02.120]  as well as prevention of disease people who alkalize the water they drink experience normalized
[3:30:02.120 --> 3:30:07.400]  blood sugar mental clarity and loss of weight it was intended for human beings to drink alkaline
[3:30:07.400 --> 3:30:12.760]  water but due to modern way of life most people are overly acidic the fact is that disease simply
[3:30:12.760 --> 3:30:17.400]  cannot exist in an alkaline environment fat accumulates if a person consumes too much acid
[3:30:17.400 --> 3:30:23.320]  on a regular basis and doesn't neutralize it do your part alkalize and supercharge your body now

[3:30:48.600 --> 3:30:55.080]  the enemy struck america on september 11th but who is the enemy bin laden this is his m o we have
[3:30:55.080 --> 3:30:59.240]  to look to the middle east we have to look to his home of bin laden fabled enemies is the first

[3:31:04.520 --> 3:31:09.880]  states some u.s. investigators believe that there are israelis again very much engaged in spying
[3:31:09.880 --> 3:31:16.680]  in and on the u.s. i'm aware that some israeli citizens have been detained and laden's connections
[3:31:16.680 --> 3:31:22.200]  to the cia the hijackers ties to the fbi the saudi arabian connection the israeli intelligence

[3:31:46.760 --> 3:31:51.320]  greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers than when drinking the water that's
[3:31:51.320 --> 3:31:56.120]  because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate and others are absorbed into the skin

[3:33:15.800 --> 3:33:24.760]  volunteer great digger for when you dig my a study would you make a shallow of eating gmo
[3:33:24.760 --> 3:33:32.680]  for several years and watching my sperm count drop to nothing i've seen the studies testicles
[3:33:32.680 --> 3:33:36.200]  dribbling everything people can laugh at that this is wife and death folks this is a game
[3:33:38.120 --> 3:33:45.000]  you can't do it with a young because they can't opt in how do we do controlled studies on humans
[3:33:45.000 --> 3:33:51.160]  i know there are volunteers who want to save humanity from this the genetics of sterilization
[3:33:51.160 --> 3:33:56.840]  of mammals is getting out in the open air cross species naturally into other food crops as you
[3:33:56.840 --> 3:34:02.680]  know jeffrey answering those questions how do we get human studies what human data do we have
[3:34:02.680 --> 3:34:06.520]  from populations that have been eating gmo the west is where the sperm counts are dropping where
[3:34:06.520 --> 3:34:10.520]  we do eat it i mean i think that's evidence right there but i mean you understand the the wide
[3:34:10.520 --> 3:34:15.720]  question right there's actually three or four questions embedded in that first of all what
[3:34:15.720 --> 3:34:21.160]  kind of evidence do we have from human studies that have already done been done and there's only
[3:34:21.160 --> 3:34:26.600]  been one human feeding study and it showed that genes that are inserted into into genetically
[3:34:26.600 --> 3:34:33.160]  engineered soy in this case transferred into the dna of the bacteria living inside our intestines
[3:34:33.160 --> 3:34:37.400]  and continue to produce these genetically engineered protein long after the person that
[3:34:37.400 --> 3:34:43.400]  stopped eating the gm soybean now this means that if we eat genetically engineered corn chips
[3:34:43.400 --> 3:34:49.080]  genetically engineered to produce the pesticide called vt if that also were to transfer to our
[3:34:49.080 --> 3:34:53.240]  bacteria inside our intestines it might turn it into living pesticide factories
[3:34:53.240 --> 3:35:01.480]  possibly for the rest of our lives now if it does disrupt the gut bacteria which is involved in
[3:35:02.120 --> 3:35:09.720]  immune defense and and digestion and protecting against intrusions into the blood then we would
[3:35:09.720 --> 3:35:15.560]  end up seeing digestive problems allergies immune problems gut leaky gut and other things which is
[3:35:15.560 --> 3:35:20.440]  what we're seeing when i give talks to medical medical groups they say you know we've seen a lot
[3:35:20.440 --> 3:35:26.200]  of gastrointestinal problems maybe this gene transfer quick example crones didn't exist 50 years ago
[3:35:26.200 --> 3:35:30.920]  now it's prolific somebody in my office has got it every time they eat gmo they have to only eat
[3:35:30.920 --> 3:35:36.120]  whole foods every time they don't eat gmo they have to go to the hospital uh just just people's
[3:35:36.120 --> 3:35:42.120]  guts are disintegrating and they use crones and other names as ketchals so it certainly could
[3:35:42.120 --> 3:35:48.040]  be gmo related now in terms of what's been happening to the population associated with gmo's
[3:35:48.040 --> 3:35:52.120]  there's very little surveillance in fact health candidates said that they would actually do
[3:35:52.120 --> 3:35:57.640]  monitoring of the canadian citizens to see if eating gmo's was going to cause problems and
[3:35:57.640 --> 3:36:01.640]  that within a year they did abandon the study saying was too difficult we do know that soon
[3:36:01.640 --> 3:36:07.560]  after gm's soy was introduced to the uk soy allergies skyrocketed by 50 percent there's
[3:36:07.560 --> 3:36:13.560]  many reasons why that may be the case due to genetically engineered soy now uh so you can't
[3:36:13.560 --> 3:36:19.800]  we can't particularly look at the at the whole issues of the united states in terms of statistics
[3:36:19.800 --> 3:36:26.040]  we see migraines going up we see you know low birth weight uh going up we see allergies going up we
[3:36:26.040 --> 3:36:31.480]  see gastrointestinal problems going up these certainly might have a contributor in the genetically
[3:36:31.480 --> 3:36:37.000]  engineered crops but in terms of how do we actually do studies on gmo's with humans we know when we
[3:36:37.000 --> 3:36:42.200]  put a drug on the market there's a four phase clinical trial you do clinical trials you do
[3:36:42.200 --> 3:36:47.160]  post marketing surveillance you do you know uh uh thick population you do a healthy population
[3:36:47.160 --> 3:36:55.160]  there's a whole protocol that's never been done with gmo's and gmo's offer a special problem
[3:36:55.160 --> 3:37:00.360]  because it's not a particular chemical that's always the same when you test it they are actually
[3:37:00.360 --> 3:37:06.440]  living organisms that change dramatically as a result of the process of genetic engineering
[3:37:06.440 --> 3:37:11.640]  and so therefore the levels of toxins or allergens and whatnot might be completely different if it's
[3:37:11.640 --> 3:37:17.480]  grown in one climate versus another or picked at a different time or happens to be a different
[3:37:17.480 --> 3:37:23.640]  subspecies within that particular plant so you really can't do a properly controlled study
[3:37:23.640 --> 3:37:29.400]  with genetically engineered organisms you they just they typically grow it under ideal conditions
[3:37:29.400 --> 3:37:34.360]  and then the other thing that they do is they isolate the the and the ingredient that's been
[3:37:34.360 --> 3:37:40.440]  produced by the inserted gene and just use that in their animal feeding studies but you see the
[3:37:40.440 --> 3:37:45.640]  whole plant is different when you're genetically engineered two to four percent of a dna is different
[3:37:45.640 --> 3:37:51.480]  hundreds of thousands of mutations are lined up and down the dna any of those any one of which
[3:37:51.480 --> 3:37:56.680]  can cause a deadly toxin or carcinogen and it's never tested for when they put these things on
[3:37:56.680 --> 3:38:03.880]  the market so right now we don't have a proper testing protocol but what we do have is a bunch of
[3:38:03.880 --> 3:38:09.720]  a false assumptions that allow these industry funded studies that basically test nothing
[3:38:09.720 --> 3:38:15.000]  to be rubber stamped by regulatory agencies around the world and then put into our food supply
[3:38:15.000 --> 3:38:19.000]  where then what actually first they put into the environment where cross pollinate
[3:38:19.000 --> 3:38:23.400]  and the self-propagating genetic pollution can easily outlast the effects of global warming
[3:38:23.400 --> 3:38:27.800]  and nuclear waste and then they put it in our food where they're feeding the products of this
[3:38:27.800 --> 3:38:34.840]  infant science to millions of people so it's a huge uncontrolled experiment which can be devastating
[3:38:34.840 --> 3:38:40.920]  to the health and life of the population and maybe already had and the way to get rid of it
[3:38:40.920 --> 3:38:46.680]  the way to stop it it turns out to be easier to stop than any of the most most many of the big
[3:38:46.680 --> 3:38:52.040]  problems are facing we think that as little as five percent of us shoppers us consumers
[3:38:52.040 --> 3:38:58.200]  15 million people conscientiously avoiding brands that can change GM ingredients by avoiding them
[3:38:58.200 --> 3:39:03.080]  it turns it creates these products which carry no consumer benefit there's no advantage to using
[3:39:03.080 --> 3:39:09.160]  GMOs by these food companies if they see they're losing market share we can plunge we can easily
[3:39:09.160 --> 3:39:13.240]  get them to remove it jeffrey we need that many people jeffrey i'm going to let you go because
[3:39:13.240 --> 3:39:20.760]  again i got behind the day you have agreed graciously to join us coming up and that is of
[3:39:20.760 --> 3:39:29.640]  course uh next friday at 11 20 central standard time uh for a little bit over an hour and so we
[3:39:29.640 --> 3:39:34.600]  look forward well actually it'll be about an hour and 30 minute interview to continue to break down
[3:39:34.600 --> 3:39:40.520]  the facts giving people the sources i would point people at info wars dot com uh in the alex jones
[3:39:40.520 --> 3:39:48.040]  recommend sections of books and videos uh to get the gmo a video an audio trilogy for 1995
[3:39:48.040 --> 3:39:54.600]  and the other books that are excellent uh that you have written so uh in summation though just
[3:39:54.600 --> 3:40:02.440]  spend about two minutes if you can please serve uh specifically explaining the latest numbers
[3:40:02.440 --> 3:40:09.080]  i know they're always changing how many staple crops uh have it uh and then and then how they're
[3:40:09.080 --> 3:40:14.760]  trying to roll it out basically into everything i mean i've spread even tea even different uh
[3:40:14.760 --> 3:40:20.840]  uh essential oil plants uh just basically strawberries i mean everything and and so this
[3:40:20.840 --> 3:40:25.480]  is a make it or break it it's already at at armageddon level and then they're about to go
[3:40:26.200 --> 3:40:32.440]  you know two alphas and turries uh at warp speed right so there's eight commercialized
[3:40:32.440 --> 3:40:37.000]  genetically engineered crops for food uh the four major ones that have been in our diet for
[3:40:37.000 --> 3:40:44.520]  for years and years are soy corn cotton seed and canola oils there's also hawaiian papaya
[3:40:45.080 --> 3:40:52.040]  and a little bit of zucchini and crookneck squash starting this year just harvested will be sugar
[3:40:52.040 --> 3:40:57.560]  from genetically engineered sugar beet and also for the first time in our diet yellow uh white
[3:40:57.560 --> 3:41:02.120]  corn it used to be just yellow corn but a little bit of white of white corn has also been introduced
[3:41:02.120 --> 3:41:08.600]  this year there's been between 100 and 200 different species i've heard the number 173
[3:41:08.600 --> 3:41:13.880]  different species that have been field trialed around the world including 50 000 different
[3:41:13.880 --> 3:41:18.760]  field trials in the united states now these are species that have been that are experimental
[3:41:18.760 --> 3:41:24.600]  that have not yet been introduced into our food supply that are awaiting approval there's also
[3:41:24.600 --> 3:41:30.360]  genetically engineered salmon that one that the company wants to introduce that and the FDA may
[3:41:30.360 --> 3:41:36.680]  fast track rules that allow approvals of that salmon before obama steps in and there's also
[3:41:36.680 --> 3:41:40.520]  even a even a company that wants to introduce genetically engineered insects and eventually
[3:41:40.520 --> 3:41:46.360]  mosquitoes and so imagine trying to do a recall there now what we've identified with genetically
[3:41:46.360 --> 3:41:52.200]  engineered crops are a long list of derivatives particularly of the soy and corn but they don't
[3:41:52.200 --> 3:41:58.200]  carry the name soy or corn in them but you have to know that they're created primarily from soy
[3:41:58.200 --> 3:42:03.720]  or corn like uh multidextrin and dextrose and things and we've got that list on responsible
[3:42:03.720 --> 3:42:09.320]  technology dot org sign up for the campaign for health you're eating in america you can either
[3:42:09.320 --> 3:42:14.120]  be a free member or you can be a donating member you can you can get all sorts of information
[3:42:14.120 --> 3:42:19.320]  you can sign up for a free syndicated monthly column which you can also go on my blog at huffington
[3:42:19.320 --> 3:42:25.640]  post we want to keep people aware as this moves forward not only with what to avoid but what steps
[3:42:25.640 --> 3:42:31.800]  we can take yes sir and and i want folks to make a commitment because you know they the social
[3:42:31.800 --> 3:42:36.120]  engineers know that we habitualize using a cell phone that radiates our brain thousands of studies
[3:42:36.120 --> 3:42:40.600]  we habitualize drinking out of cheap plastics with the endocrine disruptors leaching out of them
[3:42:40.600 --> 3:42:46.920]  we habitualize ourself uh smoking we habitualize ourselves to the gmo which is far worse as you
[3:42:46.920 --> 3:42:52.360]  know the study show than even smoking so so of course you're not going to have gmo uh tobacco
[3:42:52.360 --> 3:42:57.320]  so they are moving into every level now is the time we have to habitualize you know it's like
[3:42:57.320 --> 3:43:01.560]  getting in shape not that i'm good at that you have to totally commit to it and make it your life
[3:43:01.560 --> 3:43:06.440]  or you can't just do it halfway there are no half measures this is the biggest issue out there
[3:43:06.440 --> 3:43:12.920]  overall for health for our society for our world and this gmo revolution is so wild now and so
[3:43:12.920 --> 3:43:17.720]  dangerous we've got to put the genie back in the bottle and i just want to commend you and thank you
[3:43:17.720 --> 3:43:22.680]  for all your work and we'll talk to you next friday coming up in seven days sir great see you then
[3:43:22.680 --> 3:43:27.480]  alec thank you take care uh and by the way i would add folks if you don't want to buy the dvd uh the
[3:43:27.480 --> 3:43:33.480]  world according to monsanto it's on google video it's on youtube so but i would buy it from them
[3:43:34.760 --> 3:43:39.720]  and uh go to uh monsantofilm.com and and just get this sucker i'm not selling it we just
[3:43:39.720 --> 3:43:43.640]  bought some it will be soon but so later you get it at info wars.com you're watching this on
[3:43:43.640 --> 3:43:48.200]  you know prison planet dot tv in a few weeks but and we need money i mean you send us money you buy
[3:43:48.200 --> 3:43:53.000]  our videos our books our materials we'll just have more guests on and more and people do more radio
[3:43:53.000 --> 3:43:58.120]  shows and do everything we can here to fight it let me tell you i feel good fighting the new world
[3:43:58.120 --> 3:44:02.520]  order i feel really good uh fighting the new world order uh on prison planet dot tv i will give you
[3:44:02.520 --> 3:44:06.760]  the image of tarpaul he'll be with us the last 12 minutes or so uh popping in to finish up on the
[3:44:06.760 --> 3:44:12.680]  move by uh situation he was with us for the first um first uh hour or so uh today that's about to
[3:44:12.680 --> 3:44:18.360]  rebroadcast at info wars.com or re-stream re-transmit one of my pet pieces people calling internet
[3:44:18.360 --> 3:44:21.800]  broadcasting which is wonderful in revolution broadcasting now that's transmitting we're
[3:44:21.800 --> 3:44:26.600]  transmitting there broadcasting on amp and fm shortwave uh but i wanted to tell you about two
[3:44:26.600 --> 3:44:32.120]  sponsors that also make this show possible sodium fluoride mercury lead all these toxins in the
[3:44:32.120 --> 3:44:37.480]  water supplies the pesticide the herbicides the motor oil the runoff it's all there and the place
[3:44:37.480 --> 3:44:44.440]  to check out is a colo blue dot com e-c-o-l-o blue dot com um you've heard willy nelson everybody else
[3:44:44.440 --> 3:44:49.000]  talk about uh these systems it is an atmospheric water generator for the home we have one here in
[3:44:49.000 --> 3:44:53.960]  our office uh and we've been loving it for months and then someone when we were out for three days
[3:44:53.960 --> 3:44:58.280]  of Thanksgiving turned it off so that's why i'm not drinking it now you've got to recycle it once
[3:44:58.280 --> 3:45:02.920]  you start it back up as we did the other day and and the it'll be ready tomorrow because it's got
[3:45:02.920 --> 3:45:07.320]  carbon filters once you restart it you gotta run a few gallons through it but they do uh seven and
[3:45:07.320 --> 3:45:14.840]  a half gallons a day very easy to use they have five filters inside of it uh and uh it's just
[3:45:14.840 --> 3:45:19.720]  absolutely amazing very easy to use perhaps water out of the air no fluoride no nothing
[3:45:19.720 --> 3:45:25.240]  eight six six five eight five forty forty four this isn't out of some river with a hundred cities up
[3:45:25.240 --> 3:45:29.400]  up up river with a sewage running into it this is out of the air then through five filters

[3:46:24.440 --> 3:46:30.360]  if you have your own bread this is so important to do to protect yourself the depression coming on
[3:46:30.360 --> 3:46:35.160]  the wars the new world order just all of it eight hundred four oh nine five six three three or eat
[3:46:35.160 --> 3:46:41.240]  foods direct dot com for the balance of the show the 14 minutes or so we have left webster
[3:46:41.240 --> 3:46:46.680]  griffin tarpley for round two we ran out of time and we covered obama we covered the queen
[3:46:46.680 --> 3:46:51.400]  taking over canada today uh yes it's in Reuters we're not getting showing she rules when it finally
[3:46:51.400 --> 3:46:55.960]  comes down to her being thrown out she says i rule boom parliament you're gone uh huge so when that
[3:46:55.960 --> 3:47:01.000]  re so when we rebroadcast coming up you'll hear that the first hour we got into moon by you've got
[3:47:01.000 --> 3:47:07.320]  the floor breakdown why this is a clear intelligence operation well it's the uh obama policy of uh
[3:47:07.320 --> 3:47:13.320]  bashing pakistan dividing it into uh five or six parts remember was iristan sin punjab
[3:47:13.320 --> 3:47:19.800]  balochistan prashtunistan and and and more and more the immediate framework the us indian nuclear
[3:47:19.800 --> 3:47:24.920]  deal so the u.s has a nuclear alliance with india on the other side the urgency to get out there
[3:47:24.920 --> 3:47:30.440]  and stop the pakistani chinese alliance which is building up people say that's right they were
[3:47:30.440 --> 3:47:36.920]  getting friendly making deals for the first time in decades just magically so that's got to be
[3:47:36.920 --> 3:47:41.880]  stopped the other thing is the pakistani military fed up with the constant obama policy because
[3:47:41.880 --> 3:47:47.160]  obama is the one who demanded it the bombing and killing of pakistani civilians by these predator
[3:47:47.160 --> 3:47:51.640]  drones in the northwest area i mean imagine suppose they came around here start killing people
[3:47:51.640 --> 3:47:56.520]  you'd get your your backup pretty soon so the pakistani military had cut the supply line at
[3:47:56.520 --> 3:48:02.280]  least once saying look you want to get your truck convoy up into uh afghanistan we're stopping it no
[3:48:02.280 --> 3:48:07.320]  trucks for the next two or three days this was a big shock for the anglo americans and and for
[3:48:07.320 --> 3:48:13.240]  nato and finally gates gates in position at the pentagon now i just founder of al-qaeda founder
[3:48:13.240 --> 3:48:20.200]  of al-qaeda part of the conspiracy to take the hostages in iran and uh part of the october surprise
[3:48:20.200 --> 3:48:25.640]  so as dirty as as can be uh and this guy's now confirmed right this is the the new face of hope
[3:48:25.640 --> 3:48:31.800]  and change is Robert gates now i would say it's five or six components in the in the in the patsy
[3:48:31.800 --> 3:48:38.200]  operation because this is obviously a false flag the british colonial power with uh british
[3:48:38.200 --> 3:48:44.600]  british presidents reported people from britistan mosk vinsbury mosk british prisons leads yorkshire
[3:48:44.600 --> 3:48:50.360]  whatever it is the us the cia outpost in the federally administered tribal areas recruiting
[3:48:50.360 --> 3:48:56.440]  patsy's recruiting terrorists there the israelis big israeli india special relation general
[3:48:56.440 --> 3:49:04.280]  misrahi's visit to uh the jamoon kashmir very very it's that's a little bit like charon going on
[3:49:04.280 --> 3:49:09.400]  the temple mount something like this right big provocation get them all riled up uh there's
[3:49:09.400 --> 3:49:13.560]  also the fact that the israelis are apparently training indian special forces which may be why
[3:49:13.560 --> 3:49:21.160]  they did such a poor job then you get into the raw right the raw story the research and analysis
[3:49:21.160 --> 3:49:26.760]  wing the indian intelligence intelligence organization everybody knows the isi they've
[3:49:26.760 --> 3:49:32.280]  been demonized u.s media have never talked about the raw r a w raw deal is what you're
[3:49:32.280 --> 3:49:38.520]  going to get from them and they're into going into afghanistan picking up crazies there mujahideen
[3:49:38.520 --> 3:49:43.880]  whether they are uh taliban fighters and getting them into pakistan so that they can essentially
[3:49:43.880 --> 3:49:48.680]  wage armed civil war against the pakistani government so those guys are terrorists but
[3:49:48.680 --> 3:49:54.360]  not the way you'd normally think now the raw leads us then to this world of hindu terrorism
[3:49:54.360 --> 3:49:59.720]  and this is very very big u.s media never interested in this stuff um happens every week
[3:50:00.520 --> 3:50:03.800]  happens every week but you never hear about it in particular the guy that you're mentioning
[3:50:03.800 --> 3:50:10.360]  and i think this guy kakare kakare the anti-terrorism boss of mumbai i think is the hero of our time
[3:50:10.360 --> 3:50:16.200]  who busted a hindu extremist group army captain really staging the last train bombing blaming
[3:50:16.200 --> 3:50:19.800]  it on muslims so he goes in there with his commanders they all get killed in the first
[3:50:19.800 --> 3:50:23.960]  minute it's clear that there were snipers who were given the specific task of eliminating
[3:50:23.960 --> 3:50:28.120]  kakare and three four five of his closest because he'd been on the news saying the government
[3:50:28.120 --> 3:50:34.280]  staging the terror saying in particular that this was being done through hindu paxi not islamic but
[3:50:34.280 --> 3:50:38.520]  hindu paxi this is a big thing there's a whole world of hindu terrorism that they wanted to not
[3:50:38.520 --> 3:50:43.960]  and he's killed during the melee hold on let's continue phase one of the insiders plan for a
[3:50:43.960 --> 3:50:48.520]  one world government has been initiated with the recent bailout international bankers and power

[3:55:04.360 --> 3:55:08.760]  minutes go ahead and finish up with where this is going well it's going to be a new phase of world
[3:55:08.760 --> 3:55:13.560]  confrontation see the the anglo-american empire is collapsing financially everybody can see this
[3:55:13.560 --> 3:55:18.920]  right what's going on in london and above all new york is a total financial collapse we seem to be
[3:55:18.920 --> 3:55:24.040]  in a phase of deflation and strength of the dollar but i think this is an illusion and it's only a
[3:55:24.040 --> 3:55:28.600]  passing phase it's because a lot of people are trying to deleverage they're trying to pay down
[3:55:28.600 --> 3:55:33.400]  debt which is largely dollar denominated everybody's dumping their assets right now right so there's
[3:55:33.400 --> 3:55:37.720]  a glut of all commodities the hedge funds are in liquidation more everybody's selling selling
[3:55:37.720 --> 3:55:44.040]  selling to try to get dollars to pay off debt so you don't go bankrupt but with this seven trillion
[3:55:44.040 --> 3:55:50.920]  and some odd injected we can i think look forward to a phase of hyperinflation in 2009 and in
[3:55:50.920 --> 3:55:56.280]  the words we're going through a valley of deflation we had hyperinflation already clearly beginning
[3:55:56.280 --> 3:56:00.280]  in july august with the oil price you know up to a we're now seeing the depression of main
[3:56:00.280 --> 3:56:05.480]  street in a real economy that will now soon be an overlay of hyperinflation right so phase of deflation
[3:56:05.480 --> 3:56:11.720]  hyper stack inflation actually yes exactly the worst of both hyperinflationary depression
[3:56:11.720 --> 3:56:15.880]  hyper stack inflation we're going to need a new term you're exactly right and that and that's what
[3:56:15.880 --> 3:56:22.360]  we should do so the point is now when the anglo-american banking system and currency collapses
[3:56:22.360 --> 3:56:26.840]  the entire anglo-american ruling elite goes nuts and that's what we saw with the queen the queen is
[3:56:26.840 --> 3:56:32.520]  expressing that her her oligarchy over there and not happy campers they're going nuts because they've
[3:56:32.520 --> 3:56:38.200]  got northern rock they've got gordon brown allister thawling at the exchequer and merman king at the
[3:56:38.200 --> 3:56:41.640]  bank really trying to keep this thing the other they can't do it so they say we've got to have
[3:56:41.640 --> 3:56:46.120]  outside events and that's what rand said as you know a month ago and this pub was all over far
[3:56:46.120 --> 3:56:51.400]  and press rand corporation said we need a war bigger than iraq bigger than iran we need something
[3:56:51.400 --> 3:56:57.880]  of world war proportions and obama says it's going to be pakistan and remember that brzezinski
[3:56:57.880 --> 3:57:01.880]  is the big power at rand in other words if there's a bleeding ideologue of the rand corporation it's
[3:57:01.880 --> 3:57:05.640]  it's big my god so they're gonna who knows what they're gonna do so now look that what we've got
[3:57:05.640 --> 3:57:11.720]  us british and israel against the world was bad enough but now it's us britain israel
[3:57:12.360 --> 3:57:18.440]  plus india most likely plus georgia that's not much but that's showing india never really got
[3:57:18.440 --> 3:57:23.320]  away from england the crown is showing its power again yeah it's it's oligarchy the oligarchy
[3:57:23.320 --> 3:57:27.960]  unfortunately is based in the religion that's an unfortunate fact but then the british occupation
[3:57:27.960 --> 3:57:34.280]  but now in addition to georgia ucraine split but but uh yushenka wants to go with the us and the
[3:57:34.280 --> 3:57:41.000]  british and the imf and nato poland reliable nato puppet latvia lithuania estonia and we're
[3:57:41.000 --> 3:57:46.920]  headed into a polish missile crisis and there will be an attempt to cut the russian gas deliveries
[3:57:46.920 --> 3:57:52.280]  from russia into western europe they got to get an anti russian hysteria in europe and that'll be
[3:57:52.280 --> 3:57:56.440]  blamed on russia even though the west is talking about even though it'll be ukraine and poland
[3:57:56.440 --> 3:58:01.000]  cutting it off and stealing the gas for their own purposes and probably selling and you got
[3:58:01.000 --> 3:58:05.640]  this thing about the collinian grad x click right this little piece of pressure that separate from
[3:58:05.640 --> 3:58:11.400]  the rest it's basically a piece of pressure yeah it's right out on the ocean hold on we're out
