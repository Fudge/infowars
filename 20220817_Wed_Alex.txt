[00:00.000 --> 00:11.440]  And it's time for humanity to stand up in the Info War and say, I don't know what's going
[00:11.440 --> 00:18.400]  to happen at the end of this, but you want to fight, you better believe, you got one!
[00:18.400 --> 00:46.240]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[00:46.240 --> 00:51.480]  Celia Farber points out how the mass media tradition of obsessing over the deaths of
[00:51.480 --> 00:59.200]  celebrities has been absent since 2021, as a clear tactic to deflect mass death by COVID
[00:59.200 --> 01:00.280]  shots.
[01:00.280 --> 01:05.680]  And the death of Anne Haish marks a return to this mainstream media tradition.
[01:05.680 --> 01:08.680]  And the whole story is very strange.
[01:08.680 --> 01:14.480]  Just before the crash, Haish visited the Glass Hair Design Salon in Venice and purchased
[01:14.480 --> 01:19.600]  a red wig, where she posed for a picture with the salon's owner, who did not notice her
[01:19.600 --> 01:22.160]  to be impaired in any way.
[01:22.160 --> 01:27.360]  Minutes later, Haish crashed into an apartment complex where residents tried helping her
[01:27.360 --> 01:32.080]  out of the vehicle before the car was put in reverse and sped off.
[01:32.080 --> 01:37.520]  Videos then show her car recklessly speeding down a residential street and nearly hitting
[01:37.520 --> 01:38.960]  a pedestrian.
[01:38.960 --> 01:44.200]  She then hits a car before finally crashing the Mini Cooper into a house where it bursts
[01:44.200 --> 01:45.200]  into flames.
[01:45.200 --> 01:49.200]  But this is where the story gets really strange.
[01:49.200 --> 01:54.560]  While being carried to the ambulance, we see that her legs are secured, and she is covered
[01:54.560 --> 01:57.680]  in what looks like a cloth body bag.
[01:57.680 --> 02:02.240]  We are told that she couldn't breathe, and yet they covered her face, and the reason
[02:02.240 --> 02:07.400]  these details were noticed is because we see her become fully conscious while frantically
[02:07.400 --> 02:11.280]  trying to escape the body bag and leg straps.
[02:11.280 --> 02:16.320]  Nothing was reported about this, and Haish's former boyfriend said that Anne was stable
[02:16.320 --> 02:18.360]  and expected to pull through.
[02:18.360 --> 02:23.760]  But then we are told she is in a coma, and then we are told that while her heart is still
[02:23.760 --> 02:27.720]  beating, she is legally dead, according to California law.
[02:27.720 --> 02:31.920]  But she will be kept on life support for possible organ donation.
[02:31.920 --> 02:37.600]  And then, right in the middle of the ancient three-day festival to honor the goddess Diana,
[02:37.600 --> 02:43.440]  known as Nemeralia, they pulled a plug on Anne Haish and let her die.
[02:43.440 --> 02:49.640]  This is quite similar to what happened in Paris 25 years ago on the satanic inverted
[02:49.640 --> 02:56.440]  Nemeralia, August 31st, when Princess Diana was looked after as she bled to death in
[02:56.440 --> 02:59.360]  a tunnel dedicated to the goddess Diana.
[02:59.360 --> 03:05.600]  Many believe that Princess Diana was about to expose the royal family, and Anne Haish,
[03:05.600 --> 03:11.680]  who recently starred in a movie exposing chemtrails, was currently promoting her most recent film
[03:11.680 --> 03:15.520]  that was exposing the horrors of child sex trafficking.
[03:15.520 --> 03:20.680]  Child sex trafficking, along with all human trafficking, is the biggest business in the
[03:20.680 --> 03:21.680]  world.
[03:21.680 --> 03:26.760]  The slavery business is at an all-time high, and the thugs who run it are known for their
[03:26.760 --> 03:28.880]  satanic rituals.
[03:28.880 --> 03:34.320]  Ritual murders have always been, at a base level, a form of crowd control.
[03:34.320 --> 03:39.160]  The Anne Haish story has caused many to look back into the mysterious death of Michael
[03:39.160 --> 03:40.400]  Hastings.
[03:40.400 --> 03:46.440]  Journalist Michael Hastings had just published a story for Rolling Stone that resulted in
[03:46.440 --> 03:52.400]  the resignation of commander of U.S. forces in Afghanistan, and was working on a story
[03:52.400 --> 03:55.160]  of CIA director John Brennan.
[03:55.160 --> 04:01.000]  The day before he died, Hastings emailed friends to warn them that the feds were interviewing
[04:01.000 --> 04:06.640]  his close friends and associates, and told them he was on to a big story, and needed
[04:06.640 --> 04:09.240]  to go off the radar for a bit.
[04:09.240 --> 04:15.080]  Early the next morning, Hastings' silver Mercedes hit a palm tree and exploded, somehow launching
[04:15.080 --> 04:19.120]  the engine block 60 yards away from the car.
[04:19.120 --> 04:25.240]  Former counterterrorism czar Richard Clark told the Huffington Post that Hastings' crash
[04:25.240 --> 04:32.400]  was consistent with a car-cyber attack, and that intelligence agencies for major powers
[04:32.400 --> 04:36.040]  are able to remotely seize control of a person's vehicle.
[04:36.040 --> 04:41.320]  He added that if there was a cyber attack on Hastings' car, whoever did it would probably
[04:41.320 --> 04:43.800]  get away with it.
[04:43.800 --> 04:46.760]  Reporting for InfoWars, this is Greg Rees.
[04:46.760 --> 04:55.560]  Very important report now live at band.video and infowars.com.
[04:55.560 --> 05:01.000]  It's Wednesday, August 17th, main transmission kicks off in T-minus 60 seconds.
[05:01.000 --> 05:09.480]  The cavalry for your immune system, the cavalry for your health, and the cavalry to keep InfoWars
[05:09.480 --> 05:14.120]  on the air with funding has now arrived, a 360 win.
[05:14.120 --> 05:21.120]  It's sold out for a year, DNA Force Plus with the PQQ and the CoQ-10 and all the patented
[05:21.120 --> 05:28.920]  documented super ingredients to completely turbocharge your immune system and your body
[05:28.920 --> 05:34.360]  is finally back in stock, and despite the fact it's going to sell out quick, I want those
[05:34.360 --> 05:38.720]  of you that haven't experienced it to get it, and I want long-term supporters to experience
[05:38.720 --> 05:43.880]  it as well, so it is 50% off out of the gates for a limited time.
[05:43.880 --> 05:51.240]  DNA Force Plus, finally back in stock at infowarsstore.com for 50% off.
[05:51.240 --> 05:55.240]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is a symbiotic relationship.
[05:55.240 --> 05:58.800]  Supporting InfoWars defeats the globalist, and this product does amazing things for your
[05:58.800 --> 05:59.800]  body.
[05:59.800 --> 06:25.800]  Let's get started right now.
[06:25.800 --> 06:35.240]  There's no turning back now, we've chosen which side we're on, Team Freedom or Team
[06:35.240 --> 06:36.240]  Daemon.
[06:36.240 --> 06:46.880]  We are now inside the operational phase of global cultural and economic societal collapse
[06:46.880 --> 06:55.760]  and the mass force depopulation that has already begun according to all major insurance actuaries.
[06:55.760 --> 07:01.640]  Good deaths in every western country that has taken the experimental injections.
[07:01.640 --> 07:02.640]  Incredible time to be alive.
[07:02.640 --> 07:08.680]  Look, we've got massive political news here in the U.S. with the primaries last night
[07:08.680 --> 07:13.320]  roaming in Alaska and other areas.
[07:13.320 --> 07:19.520]  We have huge military news, huge economic news, huge Mar-a-Lago raid news where the FBI just
[07:19.520 --> 07:25.400]  three days ago said Trump's lying, we don't have his passports, and of course they did.
[07:25.400 --> 07:26.400]  This is all important.
[07:26.400 --> 07:27.400]  This is all big.
[07:27.400 --> 07:33.040]  But when I'm looking at all these stories and the guests we have today, for me, two
[07:33.040 --> 07:37.360]  things are the biggest.
[07:37.360 --> 07:44.320]  The new COVID lockdowns and new viruses they are telling us are about to arrive.
[07:44.320 --> 07:49.760]  Round two of the hell we've just seen the last two and a half years and the fact that
[07:49.760 --> 07:54.440]  the system censored and suppressed the truth and is now fully discredited but is coming
[07:54.440 --> 07:58.200]  back again for more.
[07:58.200 --> 08:05.000]  And we must form more opposition against it ahead of that, not just sit here flat footed
[08:05.000 --> 08:13.720]  and then Senate reports, DHS reports, journalistic reports confirming millions and millions and
[08:13.720 --> 08:21.000]  millions of people walking right across mainly the Texas border now, not just Arizona.
[08:21.000 --> 08:27.160]  Arizona used to be the worst, now it's Texas by far, and massive human smuggling run by
[08:27.160 --> 08:35.240]  the Biden administration through NGOs, non-governmental organizations, with on camera thousands of
[08:35.240 --> 08:38.800]  children at bus stops and airports a day.
[08:38.800 --> 08:42.600]  We filmed it, others have filmed it, Savannah Hernandez just came out from the border, she
[08:42.600 --> 08:47.560]  filmed it and talked to DHS, what's the blowers?
[08:47.560 --> 08:53.680]  Even as young as six months old with no paperwork, not with their parents being given to other
[08:53.680 --> 09:03.720]  people with no paperwork, actual child kidnapping and trafficking on an industrial scale.
[09:03.720 --> 09:07.320]  I mean there are more people coming across the border with undocumented kids that disappear
[09:07.320 --> 09:11.920]  than go to Disney World every day or six flags across the country.
[09:11.920 --> 09:17.080]  I mean this is ultra massive that the government is doing this.
[09:17.080 --> 09:21.280]  This is an illegitimate criminal government case closed.
[09:21.280 --> 09:29.480]  The entire Justice Department at the top are involved in this and are directing it, incredible.
[09:29.480 --> 09:30.480]  So that's coming up today.
[09:30.480 --> 09:39.960]  We have Savannah Hernandez joining us in the second hour on this subject and so much more.
[09:39.960 --> 09:44.600]  She's got exclusive footage, we're going to be really focusing on this because this is
[09:44.600 --> 09:48.880]  just next level, absolute next level.
[09:48.880 --> 09:53.480]  We know the globalists are obsessed with child trafficking, obsessed with pedophilia, obsessed
[09:53.480 --> 09:58.160]  with sexualization of children and I've got reports pouring in from across the country
[09:58.160 --> 10:02.560]  that are confirmed that three-year-olds are being asked by pediatricians are you a boy
[10:02.560 --> 10:06.880]  or girl and if the boy is confused, the girl is confused, they put it in their chart which
[10:06.880 --> 10:11.680]  is then put in a computer and the beginning of taking your child's identity away and the
[10:11.680 --> 10:17.800]  decision process of your children being taken away from you by the biomedical police state.
[10:17.800 --> 10:21.080]  We've got that.
[10:21.080 --> 10:24.080]  It's just unbelievable.
[10:24.080 --> 10:28.400]  We've got a mixed bag here, despite all the polls showing a massive political realignment
[10:28.400 --> 10:32.840]  against the Democrats, we have the Rhino and Neocons there that we have to worry about
[10:32.840 --> 10:38.280]  and Down Hall is a very important report saying it's panic time for Senate Republicans.
[10:38.280 --> 10:43.720]  These are panic time because these races are close and with election fraud the Democrats
[10:43.720 --> 10:47.320]  could gain seats in the Senate, not the other way around.
[10:47.320 --> 10:52.560]  Republicans running around wetting themselves with excitement that oh, we're about to take
[10:52.560 --> 11:00.280]  over the country even if we get more Senate seats and take the Senate and take the House.
[11:00.280 --> 11:06.440]  So many Republicans are basically Democrats and a Republican in name only, that's the
[11:06.440 --> 11:15.080]  big problem, but the good news is this, we have leaders like Ron DeSantis and we have
[11:15.080 --> 11:23.720]  leaders like Bolsonaro and Victor Orban and others that understand what's going on.
[11:23.720 --> 11:28.920]  Now I'll say this, I like Donald Trump and I know the system doesn't like him and I know
[11:28.920 --> 11:33.040]  I've been persecuted by nothing in my life for supporting him and that made me kind of
[11:33.040 --> 11:38.640]  pigheadedly support him a few years ago even though I disagree with his warped speed because
[11:38.640 --> 11:44.920]  I thought that we had to keep him in office because of the nightmare scenario if Hillary
[11:44.920 --> 11:50.040]  or Biden got in that before they were officially running.
[11:50.040 --> 12:00.960]  But that said, I am supporting DeSantis, DeSantis is just gone from being awesome to being unbelievably
[12:00.960 --> 12:06.640]  good and I don't just watch a man's actions as Christ said, judge a tree by his fruits.
[12:06.640 --> 12:14.320]  I can also look in his eyes on HD video and I see the real sincerity of a father and a
[12:14.320 --> 12:19.840]  husband who loves his children in this country and that he's getting red-pilled more and
[12:19.840 --> 12:25.880]  more each day and that he's white-pilled about the future and we stand up but he's black-pilled
[12:25.880 --> 12:34.920]  if we don't, he has basic self-preservation instincts and I'm a DeSantis guy.
[12:34.920 --> 12:39.080]  And if we can use DeSantis' leadership to get Trump back on the straight and narrow,
[12:39.080 --> 12:42.240]  that's all the better.
[12:42.240 --> 12:48.760]  But Trump will not talk about his poison vaccines anymore, that's a plus, but he still says
[12:48.760 --> 12:52.480]  he won't say the V word but he's still proud of it.
[12:52.480 --> 12:56.240]  DeSantis came out in a press conference yesterday, we're going to play clip sub next segment
[12:56.240 --> 13:01.240]  and the whole thing's on infoawards.com, I suggest you go watch it, it's about 45
[13:01.240 --> 13:02.240]  minutes long.
[13:02.240 --> 13:06.720]  We're going to play a little three minute clip when we come back where he annihilates
[13:06.720 --> 13:13.720]  Big Pharma, he annihilates the biomedical police state and he annihilates the lies that
[13:13.720 --> 13:19.280]  they've told about it and he says he was wrong and he was lied to and the vaccine doesn't
[13:19.280 --> 13:21.880]  help you, it hurts you.
[13:21.880 --> 13:28.600]  What's all Trump needs to do is say I was lied to by Birx and Fauci and they were holding
[13:28.600 --> 13:33.560]  the country hostage and I thought it was a regular vaccine and it turns out they shouldn't
[13:33.560 --> 13:36.480]  be pushing it on children, they shouldn't be making people take it.
[13:36.480 --> 13:40.400]  He's already saying that, but he's to come out all the way and say I was lied to and
[13:40.400 --> 13:51.160]  decouple his pig-headed butt that I still love, he's real, he's just pig-headed and that's
[13:51.160 --> 13:55.760]  a positive thing when he's fighting for us, it's not when he won't admit he's wrong,
[13:55.760 --> 14:01.200]  Bolsonaro apologized and said it was bad from the start, I shouldn't have halfway supported
[14:01.200 --> 14:05.400]  it though I was never for forced injection.
[14:05.400 --> 14:11.760]  And now DeSantis has come out in a bunch of speeches and said this is bad news, that's
[14:11.760 --> 14:16.720]  all we want so we can stop poisoning the newborn babies on the six month olds and everybody
[14:16.720 --> 14:21.360]  and they got public schools all over blue cities and blue states trying to make the injections
[14:21.360 --> 14:26.000]  mandatory to go to school, damn it.
[14:26.000 --> 14:33.160]  So I choose children over Trump and I'm going to say it, I'm not going to get sucked into
[14:33.160 --> 14:39.840]  politics and just support Trump because I hate the Democrats, if Trump doesn't come out
[14:39.840 --> 14:45.480]  against these shots and if he doesn't stand with the children, if he doesn't go on the
[14:45.480 --> 14:54.400]  offense to admit there's major problems, then I'm really caught between a rock and
[14:54.400 --> 15:02.480]  a hard place because I don't want Kamala Harris or Michael Obama or any of those people and
[15:02.480 --> 15:07.400]  I know you don't but I cannot support Trump when the evidence is out that it's killing
[15:07.400 --> 15:12.120]  all these people and maiming others if he continues to do this and I think we should
[15:12.120 --> 15:14.920]  open the phones up today on this subject.
[15:14.920 --> 15:17.640]  What do we do with Trump if he won't stop it?
[15:17.640 --> 15:25.600]  Now he's already turned the ship around about 80 degrees, now he needs to turn it around
[15:25.600 --> 15:32.080]  all the rest of the way, now he needs to turn it around another 100 degrees and go the opposite
[15:32.080 --> 15:38.720]  direction away but he's only turned part way away, he's only turned part way around.
[15:38.720 --> 15:45.000]  We need a full turning around and going the opposite direction because I will not be part
[15:45.000 --> 15:50.640]  of the poisoning of these six month old babies, damn it and I don't mean that as taking Lord's
[15:50.640 --> 15:56.600]  name in vain, I mean damn these people to hell including Trump if he doesn't stop it,
[15:56.600 --> 15:58.240]  people are our enemies.

[19:05.040 --> 19:10.240]  highest quality signature reducing Faraday cages, the Pentagon and other US government
[19:10.240 --> 19:17.400]  agencies and now they have produced specifically for us this made America onion line at a very

[19:42.480 --> 19:48.440]  In this insane world you are crazy if you don't protect your signature, your identity
[19:48.440 --> 19:52.920]  from identity theft, hackers, criminals, corporations, governments.
[19:52.920 --> 20:00.920]  This is one of the hottest items out there today that's exclusively available at infowarstore.com.
[20:00.920 --> 20:18.040]  Including a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[20:18.040 --> 20:26.080]  What we need, what America and the world absolutely must have is leaders like Ron DeSantis to
[20:26.080 --> 20:32.040]  come out against these poison shots and say we were lied to and reverse this depopulation
[20:32.040 --> 20:34.320]  we are witnessing.
[20:34.320 --> 20:38.460]  DeSantis is again just over the top with what he's doing.
[20:38.460 --> 20:41.720]  This is absolutely presidential material.
[20:41.720 --> 20:46.320]  This is what Trump should be like and I've been hammering this point and he's doing
[20:46.320 --> 20:53.600]  it now and we have someone that is better than Trump, way better than Trump and I want
[20:53.600 --> 20:58.120]  Trump to decouple himself from the poison shot now but I'm not gonna sit here and hold
[20:58.120 --> 20:59.120]  my breath.
[20:59.120 --> 21:03.840]  Here is DeSantis in the best two and a half minutes out there nailing these bastards.
[21:03.840 --> 21:08.960]  And what was right now people are doing looking at the research are saying oh man the mass
[21:08.960 --> 21:10.200]  will hurt the kids.
[21:10.200 --> 21:15.960]  Now we banned the mass in Florida with the legislature, with the parents bill of rights
[21:15.960 --> 21:21.240]  and other actions but you know the reality is that was not grounded in data.
[21:21.240 --> 21:23.040]  It was not grounded in evidence.
[21:23.040 --> 21:27.440]  It was basically the current thing you know people would put in their Twitter profile
[21:27.440 --> 21:33.120]  a mask and a syringe and that was like their identity and it was ridiculous.
[21:33.120 --> 21:35.960]  They lied to us about the mRNA shots.
[21:35.960 --> 21:39.740]  They said if you take it you will not get COVID that is false.
[21:39.740 --> 21:45.280]  That is not true and they continue to say even now when the evidence is so overwhelming
[21:45.280 --> 21:50.840]  that not only is that not true people that have multiple boosters you know you're definitely
[21:50.840 --> 21:51.920]  at risk of getting it.
[21:51.920 --> 21:53.800]  There's no question about that.
[21:53.800 --> 22:00.840]  So it's just time and time again I think you've seen ideology placed over data and evidence
[22:00.840 --> 22:06.160]  and then what happens is that they will say something like okay six weeks of mass will
[22:06.160 --> 22:07.160]  end COVID.
[22:07.160 --> 22:08.200]  So that's what they claim.
[22:08.200 --> 22:12.760]  It doesn't happen and then what they will do is they will kind of move the goalposts
[22:12.760 --> 22:19.760]  and say well you know only 95% wore it so now and they will constantly try to shift because
[22:19.760 --> 22:23.840]  they will never admit that their ideology was incorrect.
[22:23.840 --> 22:26.680]  So that's very very dangerous when you're looking at all these things.
[22:26.680 --> 22:30.800]  So that's a problem with our society that we're grappling with and what I've said in
[22:30.800 --> 22:34.320]  the state of Florida because we've taken on woke corporations.
[22:34.320 --> 22:37.640]  We've taken on ESG obviously in the classroom.
[22:37.640 --> 22:47.080]  We've battled a lot of ideologies but what I've said is that the state of Florida is
[22:47.080 --> 22:50.680]  the place where woke goes to die.
[22:50.680 --> 22:57.080]  We are not going to let this state, we're not going to let this state descend into some
[22:57.080 --> 22:58.880]  type of woke dumpster fire.
[22:58.880 --> 23:01.760]  We're going to be following common sense.
[23:01.760 --> 23:05.520]  We're going to be following facts and that's just really really important.
[23:05.520 --> 23:07.720]  So anyways thank you guys for being here.
[23:07.720 --> 23:08.720]  God bless you all.
[23:08.720 --> 23:13.760]  Well John has given us the sandwich.
[23:13.760 --> 23:19.000]  No mistake about that and I got a message for President Trump.
[23:19.000 --> 23:25.160]  You are the real president, we're reelected by a landslide, I have fought for you, 95%
[23:25.160 --> 23:29.400]  of what you've done has been incredible, you have amazing courage and energy and I respect
[23:29.400 --> 23:38.760]  you but if you continue to let this poison be pushed on our people and our children,
[23:38.760 --> 23:41.800]  I'm coming after you.
[23:41.800 --> 23:48.600]  I'm not risking my life and going through hell to sit here and then have it on my conscience
[23:48.600 --> 23:53.360]  all these dead and dying children and others that are taking your stupid evil warp speed
[23:53.360 --> 23:59.320]  crap that you got fooled and roped into but we all just heard the sandwich.
[23:59.320 --> 24:01.720]  He says we now know we were lied to.
[24:01.720 --> 24:05.120]  That's the Rubicon you're crossing right now Trump.
[24:05.120 --> 24:10.880]  We all know you know it doesn't work and it's a lie and it's poisonous.
[24:10.880 --> 24:20.880]  The side effects are the real effect and so I want everybody to call Mar-a-Lago, call
[24:20.880 --> 24:28.160]  their information line, call Trump's resorts, he'll get the word, everybody I know that
[24:28.160 --> 24:29.160]  talks to Trump.
[24:29.160 --> 24:35.600]  In fact I could probably get a hold of him, I'm going to get a hold of his ass and say
[24:35.600 --> 24:40.760]  what are you doing?
[24:40.760 --> 24:43.320]  Stop it.
[24:43.320 --> 24:46.560]  What do you think you've been a part of?
[24:46.560 --> 24:54.440]  De-couple now, reject it now and you will be forgiven.
[24:54.440 --> 24:59.040]  We don't think you did this on purpose but if you continue then you're doing it on purpose,
[24:59.040 --> 25:03.080]  the evidence is overwhelming.
[25:03.080 --> 25:07.800]  We're not going to allow you to join the New World Order and destroy us and depopulate
[25:07.800 --> 25:10.600]  us Trump.
[25:10.600 --> 25:20.120]  Look at this, Jack Mesobot retweeted it, Patricia Carvalos, look at this, this is a real tweet.
[25:20.120 --> 25:25.760]  I just had my fourth dose after receiving, listen to this carefully, I just had my fourth
[25:25.760 --> 25:33.400]  dose after recovering three months, listen to that again, I've just had my fourth dose
[25:33.400 --> 25:40.560]  after recovering three months from actively having COVID-19, no you have the spike protein,
[25:40.560 --> 25:48.440]  protein poisoning you, sweetheart, read it again, I've just had my fourth dose after
[25:48.440 --> 25:55.800]  recovering from three months of actively having COVID-19, now listen to the Stockholm syndrome,
[25:55.800 --> 26:03.700]  listen to the mind control and I'm very happy to be boosted thanks science, so she murders
[26:03.700 --> 26:08.040]  logic here, doesn't see what's being done to her and then has the cult statement of
[26:08.040 --> 26:13.080]  thanks science like she's just trumped everybody.
[26:13.080 --> 26:17.760]  I forget the name of the show, I'm not a huge TV watcher but it was on 15, 16, 17 years
[26:17.760 --> 26:24.840]  ago about pimps and prostitutes and it was this prostitute with cigarette burns all over
[26:24.840 --> 26:33.000]  and broken arm and leg beat up by her pimp and she's in the hospital room and the pimp
[26:33.000 --> 26:40.480]  comes in and she says to the pimp right in front of the poor woman's mother, front of
[26:40.480 --> 26:49.120]  the sex slaves mother, baby, she says to the pimp, I'm going to get better, I'm going
[26:49.120 --> 26:52.240]  to get back up on my feet, I'm going to get back down on the street, baby, please don't,
[26:52.240 --> 26:58.160]  oh baby and they start interviewing the pimp and they go well how do you treat her, he
[26:58.160 --> 27:04.680]  goes I treat her bad, that's how she likes it, well how much do you pay her, I pay her
[27:04.680 --> 27:12.480]  nothing, I might give her a bucket of chicken and that's the American people and that's
[27:12.480 --> 27:17.000]  the left and that's the people signed up for this evil, this mind control, this Stockholm
[27:17.000 --> 27:19.640]  syndrome.
[27:19.640 --> 27:24.440]  She's had four shots, she's been sick for months after the first few shots and now she's
[27:24.440 --> 27:29.320]  gotten another shot and thinks COVID's taking her life over but this shot was 100% effective
[27:29.320 --> 27:37.160]  they said but the shot gives you the disease but she can't help it, she can't admit she
[27:37.160 --> 27:43.080]  was lied to, she can't admit the systems out to get her just like that poor prostitute
[27:43.080 --> 27:48.280]  with broken arm and leg and cigarette burns all over, her hair falling out, you can tell
[27:48.280 --> 27:53.800]  she's been a beautiful woman and in comes the swaggering arrogant devil right in front
[27:53.800 --> 27:59.920]  of the mother, oh baby baby I'm sorry I'm so let you down I'm gonna get back on the
[27:59.920 --> 28:06.160]  street right now as soon as I get better baby, oh baby, oh baby baby, that's right you better
[28:06.160 --> 28:12.480]  get your ass back on the street bitch and the mother looks at him and says what have
[28:12.480 --> 28:26.000]  you done to my baby, what have you done to my baby he says shut up you old bitch and
[28:26.000 --> 28:29.760]  that's what they've done to America and that's what they've done to us and they think they're
[28:29.760 --> 28:34.000]  gonna bully me and lie about me and harass me and attack me and it's gonna make me roll
[28:34.000 --> 28:39.600]  over well guess what I haven't had my will broken I'm not under Stockholm syndrome and

[34:07.400 --> 34:12.120]  great reset cutting off the power worldwide news and the Tucker Carlson is taking it into
[34:12.120 --> 34:16.240]  the danger zone as well everybody's up in their game or they're rolling over you're
[34:16.240 --> 34:19.920]  either going to get more hardcore or you're going to die you're going to either fight
[34:19.920 --> 34:25.880]  or you're going to be a slave Carlson came right out we'll hit it next segment and said
[34:25.880 --> 34:31.080]  the FBI is the prime suspect with the pipe bombs and laid out the evidence January 6 as it just
[34:31.080 --> 34:35.640]  came out the FBI planted the pipe bombs and the bombs with the Whitmer case now they're
[34:35.640 --> 34:42.480]  having the next trial they already found the other people basically hung juries in the
[34:42.480 --> 34:47.880]  whole Whitmer kidnapping plat that was fake that's all coming out so it's an incredible
[34:47.880 --> 34:54.640]  time to be alive and to really find out who we are because it's in the crucible it's
[34:54.640 --> 35:01.160]  in the fire then it'll be shown who we are do we break under the assault or do we rise
[35:01.160 --> 35:08.520]  the occasion and become even stronger I pray to God to send the Holy Spirit to give me
[35:08.520 --> 35:16.280]  more discernment more will and more strength I willingly turn over my will to God and
[35:16.280 --> 35:23.520]  ask God to purge me of my imperfections and raise me up as a symbol of resistance and
[35:23.520 --> 35:40.280]  pro-human future in the name of our Lord and Savior Christ Jesus amen now let me give
[35:40.280 --> 35:46.360]  you some good news as I get so many questions on the street so many questions from family
[35:46.360 --> 35:49.720]  so many questions from crew I'm going to say it again and I'm going to get back to the
[35:49.720 --> 35:56.120]  good news we don't have four hundred million dollars we don't have three hundred million
[35:56.120 --> 36:00.920]  dollars we don't have a hundred million dollars we don't have ten million dollars I saw ten
[36:00.920 --> 36:06.760]  pool last night I ended up watching it early this morning I got up at four a.m. he had
[36:06.760 --> 36:12.720]  Jack Pasobicon they were saying nice things about me overall but he said listen Alex is
[36:12.720 --> 36:19.840]  so successful I'm sure he does have money I'm sure he does have trust for his kids I'm
[36:19.840 --> 36:24.360]  sure that when he says he doesn't have a bunch of money it's true but he's got some hidden
[36:24.360 --> 36:28.800]  somewhere and I need everybody to know wouldn't be bad if I had money because I could fight
[36:28.800 --> 36:35.680]  harder but I don't yes there's about four hundred thousand dollars in trust funds for
[36:35.680 --> 36:41.000]  my four children and most of it was put there before I was ever sued and it feels dumb even
[36:41.000 --> 36:48.840]  having it there because it's being devalued and my son's 19 he's used some of it the
[36:48.840 --> 36:53.200]  other children have used some of it for things they wanted to do so it was probably six hundred
[36:53.200 --> 36:56.840]  thousand dollars a few years ago it's about four hundred thousand now and that's the total
[36:56.840 --> 37:04.200]  of money that's there four hundred thousand roughly you may be less no there's no extra
[37:04.200 --> 37:11.480]  money do I own a lake cabin did I have a smaller house after I had a bigger house I bought
[37:11.480 --> 37:17.040]  as an investment I put all the money back in yes have I been somewhat wise about raising
[37:17.040 --> 37:21.680]  funds from this operation yes I'm in these debt positions they go oh we hear you got
[37:21.680 --> 37:25.680]  a ranch in East Texas where is it I don't have a ranch my dad and his brother have a
[37:25.680 --> 37:30.760]  ranch and I don't want them to die so I get it but yeah I'll be the heir to a large ranch
[37:30.760 --> 37:36.480]  that we've had since the 1820s we have the Mexican land grant paperwork still laminated
[37:36.480 --> 37:49.040]  an old family Bible from the mid 1820s that's all on we've been in Texas I don't have extra
[37:49.040 --> 37:54.600]  money we've got a couple million dollars in the info wars account and that's all needed
[37:54.600 --> 38:00.680]  for payroll and rent and electricity and legal and buying product of the future we don't
[38:00.680 --> 38:05.680]  have twenty percent of what we need for a company this large on this level of attack
[38:05.680 --> 38:13.240]  but God will provide or I'll take us out of the game I personally personally with everything
[38:13.240 --> 38:21.520]  I've got going on have less than two million dollars and that is emergency funds to continue
[38:21.520 --> 38:27.600]  the fight on and stay on air no matter what happens an equivalent operation like this
[38:27.600 --> 38:32.400]  would have a hundred million dollars in reserve to run a small town newspaper cost ten million
[38:32.400 --> 38:37.680]  dollars a year a mid-sized city newspaper thirty million a big city paper a couple hundred
[38:37.680 --> 38:47.160]  million those are newspapers money ain't what it used to be I am on E and I've got a destination
[38:47.160 --> 38:55.400]  I've got to get to where I need a half a tank and they know that we gave them all the discover
[38:55.400 --> 39:00.000]  they asked for even though it was unprecedented and they twisted it and lied and use it as
[39:00.000 --> 39:10.280]  a blueprint to try to de-platform us but the good news is this by filing federal bankruptcy
[39:10.280 --> 39:16.760]  under certified federal law we can put before the families who are being used by these ambulance
[39:16.760 --> 39:21.560]  chasing Democrat lawyers the fact that there isn't all this money and that they're being
[39:21.560 --> 39:27.440]  used to use their children not just against the second amendment but against the first
[39:27.440 --> 39:34.440]  amendment itself as well but the good news is when our suppliers call us and I talk
[39:34.440 --> 39:40.120]  to the owners of companies whether it's t-shirt manufacturers or whether it's water filter
[39:40.120 --> 39:45.240]  manufacturers or whether it's supplement manufacturers and they say we see all this news are you
[39:45.240 --> 39:50.960]  going to be on air do we need you to pay a hundred percent up front for product you buy
[39:50.960 --> 39:55.360]  instead of fifty percent I say to them the same thing I'm telling you a status report
[39:55.360 --> 40:05.760]  if people purchase products at the level they did two years ago we will be able to pay for
[40:05.760 --> 40:10.840]  the bankruptcy pay for the lawsuits pay for the show trials pay for the appeals and stay
[40:10.840 --> 40:16.920]  on the air for years and years and years and probably win but regardless the world's so
[40:16.920 --> 40:21.120]  dangerous then if we don't turn this around it's not going to matter like having your
[40:21.120 --> 40:27.480]  toe cut off versus your head we're all in the gallows here we're all in the guillotine
[40:27.480 --> 40:31.240]  but it's so critical to keep us on air because the enemy knows we're the number one resistance
[40:31.240 --> 40:38.640]  point worldwide that world leaders like or bond and Bolsonaro on record are listening
[40:38.640 --> 40:45.320]  and DeSantis is listening and Trump is listening and they're listening to you so we will stay
[40:45.320 --> 40:50.960]  on air and the good news is the supply chain breakdowns all that has gotten better for
[40:50.960 --> 40:55.000]  now we were able to put the money in to get all the great products to come back in they're
[40:55.000 --> 40:59.200]  starting to come back in and that will project us into the future to be able to stay on air
[40:59.200 --> 41:06.080]  strong and not stop fighting thanks to your support and so that's the great news and finally

[48:16.800 --> 48:21.680]  it's all the facts we know that now we need Trump to do the same thing or what do we do
[48:21.680 --> 48:29.200]  about Trump he's just got to do it Bolsonaro and the Santas have done Orban has come out
[48:29.200 --> 48:34.040]  and said the shot doesn't work and was a lie just decouple yourself so we can stop giving
[48:34.040 --> 48:42.120]  this shot that erases immune systems and doesn't protect people and makes people sick what do

[49:28.120 --> 49:34.080]  back to the stack I was already mentioning top Biden advisor Anita Dunn I've all just
[49:34.080 --> 49:41.560]  massive conflict of interest she worked for Pfizer but it's okay I've just had my fourth
[49:41.560 --> 49:47.520]  dose after recovering three months from actually having covered after the first shots and I'm
[49:47.520 --> 49:58.000]  very happy to be boosted thanks science yeah doesn't work it's all I think science mass
[49:58.000 --> 50:07.160]  care nearly half of pregnant women in Pfizer trial miscarried 82% in the first trimester
[50:07.160 --> 50:15.240]  let's play a clip out of New Zealand in a small town of 13,107 a woman visiting family
[50:15.240 --> 50:21.560]  members that died in a car wreck years before and she notices massive numbers of people
[50:21.560 --> 50:28.200]  buried it's not just her anecdotal observation it's what all the insurance actuaries show
[50:28.200 --> 50:33.440]  a small town of pleasant drive through a peaceful cemetery disrupted by truckloads of freshly
[50:33.440 --> 50:39.160]  laid graves and this is what the funeral homes are telling us what the epidemiologists
[50:39.160 --> 50:49.160]  are telling us what the pathologists are telling us here's the club that's us so far 66 whole
[50:49.160 --> 51:11.680]  67,68,69,70,71,72,73,74,75,76,77,78,79,80,81,82,83,85,86,87,88,89,90,91,92,93,94 94 dead bodies these
[51:11.680 --> 51:20.600]  are all freshly buried in our small town of Omaru just come to check my babies and look
[51:20.600 --> 51:33.920]  at all these new graves mate why why why so many we never have this many I've come here
[51:33.920 --> 51:41.680]  for the last eight nine years or 21s and 22s these are all deaths and the last year like
[51:41.680 --> 51:51.040]  fresh as my these are all fresh they haven't even got headstones yet so we've just counted
[51:51.040 --> 52:03.680]  how many was that 99 98 92 92 new graves in Omaru wow that's from rise Melbourne
[52:03.680 --> 52:15.280]  but it's not just their anecdotal take they're right Indiana life insurance CEO says deaths
[52:15.280 --> 52:24.240]  are up 40% among people ages 18 to 64 and if you look at that that's a multi thousand
[52:24.240 --> 52:29.640]  percentage increase usually deaths are up 1% 2% or down 1 or 2 it goes up and down but
[52:29.640 --> 52:37.800]  now it's 40% ultra massive life insurance CEO says deaths up 40% German insurance company
[52:37.800 --> 52:45.800]  say up 40% huge huge numbers insurance group sees death rates 40% over pre pandemic levels
[52:45.800 --> 52:53.120]  above 2000 since the vaccine was brought in oh but AP says vaccines didn't cause increase
[52:53.120 --> 52:57.960]  in deaths life insurance payouts there are increased deaths they admit life insurance
[52:57.960 --> 53:06.200]  CEO says deaths up 40% amongst those ages 18 to 64 first class action settlement in nation
[53:06.200 --> 53:12.240]  reached over health care workers over vaccine mandates quadruple vax jail biden test positive
[53:12.240 --> 53:19.480]  for covid washwall public three phases of covid locking you down training you for the
[53:19.480 --> 53:28.600]  new system and then the great reset now it's over 20 doctors dead from heart attacks young
[53:28.600 --> 53:38.280]  doctors in Canada death cult programming expose a professional sporting events gives us great
[53:38.280 --> 53:50.680]  warning of the future and it goes on and on that's the reality the big story is they're
[53:50.680 --> 53:59.160]  killing us all right out in the open and I think we're fools and can't see what they're
[53:59.160 --> 54:11.280]  doing to us but the good news is and I said I'd get to this let's go ahead and get to
[54:11.280 --> 54:15.240]  it now project veritas is reporting record numbers of FBI and Justice Department and
[54:15.240 --> 54:20.280]  DHS whistleblowers Tucker Carlson's been reporting on it there are good people there and they
[54:20.280 --> 54:25.400]  are so key in exposing this whole thing but here's a Carlson looking at at the FBI and
[54:25.400 --> 54:32.320]  its bombs just like with the fake Whitmer kidnapping they planted bombs that sex operatives controlling
[54:32.320 --> 54:36.440]  people that's come out in court in the last couple days but here's Tucker Carlson laying
[54:36.440 --> 54:42.120]  out the rest of the story but the truth is there are still questions about the FBI's
[54:42.120 --> 54:50.320]  behavior on and around January 6 and given what happened in Michigan where we know beyond
[54:50.320 --> 54:57.840]  question that the FBI tried to create an act of terror it's fair to ask what exactly did
[54:57.840 --> 55:04.600]  happen on January 6 and why is the FBI still hiding footage critically of the person who
[55:04.600 --> 55:10.960]  planted a pipe bomb outside the DNC on January 6 while Kamala Harris was apparently inside
[55:10.960 --> 55:16.000]  something that she lied about for months what exactly is going on here we're of course not
[55:16.000 --> 55:22.160]  alleging anything we don't know the answer but we know for a fact given the FBI's behavior
[55:22.160 --> 55:26.080]  and we report this with great sadness over the last several years it is worth getting
[55:26.080 --> 55:31.080]  to the bottom of this in fact we have to if we're going to restore confidence in federal
[55:31.080 --> 55:36.960]  law enforcement no one is asking these questions really apart from revolver news and here's
[55:36.960 --> 55:46.240]  what they've come up with watch this camera one shows the pipe bomber walking up to the
[55:46.240 --> 55:49.960]  DNC grounds at roughly 740 to PM he sits on bench one then he gets up and walks off screen
[55:49.960 --> 55:55.120]  according to the FBI he walks the length of the DNC building and ten minutes later he
[55:55.120 --> 56:01.360]  comes back to the same bench area and sits on bench two there at 750 to PM camera to
[56:01.360 --> 56:06.200]  captures the pipe bomber sitting on bench two and we are told planting the pipe bomb
[56:06.200 --> 56:10.640]  by the side of the bench next to the bush we are told the pipe bomber plants the pipe
[56:10.640 --> 56:15.720]  bomb there but we can't see it camera two is occluded by a giant bush that blocks the
[56:15.720 --> 56:21.640]  scene the pipe bomber even looks at camera to head on for some reason it's very frustrating
[56:21.640 --> 56:26.840]  because we can't see the moment the pipe bomber plants the pipe bomb but the FBI can that's
[56:26.840 --> 56:30.880]  because the whole scene should be captured on camera one as well and much more clearly
[56:30.880 --> 56:36.920]  than camera two camera one has a clear shot of both benches if the FBI released the full

[59:35.480 --> 59:39.760]  that they can but they're not going to be able to do it prove that censorship doesn't
[59:39.760 --> 59:44.280]  work by the great reset thank you Alex Jones I really appreciate you having me on and I
[59:44.280 --> 59:51.760]  appreciate you writing this book and getting the information out there leading a frontal
[59:51.760 --> 1:00:16.720]  assault on the lies of the new world order it's Alex Jones
[1:00:16.720 --> 1:00:24.280]  most banned network in the world watch this camera one shows the pipe bomber walking up
[1:00:24.280 --> 1:00:30.880]  to the DNC grounds at roughly 740 to PM he sits on bench one then he gets up walks off
[1:00:30.880 --> 1:00:36.680]  screen according to the FBI he walks the length of the DNC building and 10 minutes later he
[1:00:36.680 --> 1:00:43.080]  comes back to the same bench area and sits on bench two air at 750 to PM camera to captures
[1:00:43.080 --> 1:00:48.040]  the pipe bomber sitting on bench two and we are told planting the pipe bomb by the side
[1:00:48.040 --> 1:00:52.720]  of the bench next to the bush we are told the pipe bomber plants the pipe bomb there
[1:00:52.720 --> 1:00:58.080]  but we can't see it camera two is occluded by a giant bush that blocks the scene the
[1:00:58.080 --> 1:01:03.200]  pipe bomber even looks a camera to head on for some reason it's very frustrating because
[1:01:03.200 --> 1:01:08.400]  we can't see the moment the pipe bomber plants the pipe bomb but the FBI can that's because
[1:01:08.400 --> 1:01:12.760]  the whole scene should be captured on camera one as well and much more clearly than camera
[1:01:12.760 --> 1:01:19.040]  two camera one has a clear shot of both benches if the FBI released the full tape from camera
[1:01:19.040 --> 1:01:24.760]  one we could see the pipe bomber planting the bomb
[1:01:24.760 --> 1:01:32.400]  okay so what exactly happened outside the DNC on January 6th and why is no one asking
[1:01:32.400 --> 1:01:39.480]  that question and why has the Department of Justice not told us we've heard everything
[1:01:39.480 --> 1:01:43.880]  they want us to know about January 6th why not more about this Darren Beatty of Revolver
[1:01:43.880 --> 1:01:47.320]  News is one of the few people who is pressing for answers he joins us tonight thanks so
[1:01:47.320 --> 1:01:52.840]  much for coming on so we explained to us for those who may have been confused by the tape
[1:01:52.840 --> 1:01:57.560]  which we just played that was evocative raised questions what do you think this what is going
[1:01:57.560 --> 1:02:04.240]  on here what does this add up to you well first what it definitively shows this piece
[1:02:04.240 --> 1:02:10.760]  at revolver.news available right now shows definitively and without question that the
[1:02:10.760 --> 1:02:18.960]  FBI is withholding hiding concealing from the public critical footage of the pipe bomber
[1:02:18.960 --> 1:02:27.080]  actually planting the bomb actually placing the bomb down and the question is why would
[1:02:27.080 --> 1:02:33.040]  they do that why would they hide precisely the piece of footage that would be most likely
[1:02:33.040 --> 1:02:40.040]  to help them get the public to catch and identify the perpetrator and furthermore given that
[1:02:40.040 --> 1:02:45.280]  we know that they're hiding this footage and that the bomb was placed outside of the democrat
[1:02:45.280 --> 1:02:51.680]  national committee building allegedly by some MAGA Trump supporter January 6th pipe bomber
[1:02:51.680 --> 1:02:57.040]  why aren't democrats demanding to Merrick Garland to Steven D'Antuono to Christopher
[1:02:57.040 --> 1:03:03.000]  Ray that they release this piece of critical footage what do you think the answer I mean
[1:03:03.000 --> 1:03:07.600]  that is so bizarre I mean they they're constantly telling you that right-wing extremists are
[1:03:07.600 --> 1:03:12.840]  the great terror threat that we face so here you have a case where someone somebody actually
[1:03:12.840 --> 1:03:17.400]  did put a pipe bomb outside the DNC and they don't seem interested in finding out who it
[1:03:17.400 --> 1:03:23.640]  was that does not make sense at all it doesn't make sense at all and look if people read
[1:03:23.640 --> 1:03:29.880]  the full piece of revolver news you'll see that this is just one of many absolutely
[1:03:29.880 --> 1:03:37.200]  mind-blowing coincidences related to the pipe bomb situation keep in mind we know this pipe
[1:03:37.200 --> 1:03:43.400]  bomb that was allegedly planted the evening before wasn't discovered until after the
[1:03:43.400 --> 1:03:48.960]  RNC pipe bomb was discovered at 1240 that means there was an entire morning of people
[1:03:48.960 --> 1:03:56.120]  walking by of pedestrians of motorists of DNC security who didn't see it and even the
[1:03:56.120 --> 1:04:03.920]  secret service itself which we know by reports swept the area checked entrances the pipe
[1:04:03.920 --> 1:04:10.080]  bomb was placed just feet away from an exit to the DNC building and the secret service
[1:04:10.080 --> 1:04:16.200]  missed it and they missed it so that the actual pipe bomb would first be discovered at the
[1:04:16.200 --> 1:04:23.680]  RNC discovered at 1240 and so when it was reported the Capitol Police responded to it
[1:04:23.680 --> 1:04:29.840]  just a minute before that first and decisive assault on the Capitol perimeter so everything
[1:04:29.840 --> 1:04:36.400]  was timed in just such a remarkable fashion as to be frankly unbelievable and I think
[1:04:36.400 --> 1:04:42.200]  everyone needs to pose these questions very directly and very forcefully to Merrick Garland
[1:04:42.200 --> 1:04:48.080]  to Christopher Ray and to Stephen D'Antuono because we really need answers at this point.
[1:04:48.080 --> 1:04:52.200]  And to Liz Cheney why is the January 6th committee not interested in this I think I don't know
[1:04:52.200 --> 1:04:54.560]  what the answer is but it's certainly bizarre.
[1:04:54.560 --> 1:04:57.760]  Darren Beatty thanks for your reporting on this.
[1:04:57.760 --> 1:04:58.760]  Thank you.

[1:06:00.800 --> 1:06:15.120]  Live from Austin, Texas broadcasting from Austin, Texas broadcasting worldwide it's
[1:06:15.120 --> 1:06:16.120]  Alex Jones.
[1:06:16.120 --> 1:06:22.160]  Hi we're going to look at the admissions that the US government under Biden is involved
[1:06:22.160 --> 1:06:27.240]  in public child trafficking giving children to people with no documents no evidence who
[1:06:27.240 --> 1:06:31.760]  they are including little bitty babies that's coming up with exclusive information but if
[1:06:31.760 --> 1:06:35.840]  you just joined us here in the second hour I played a clip in the middle of the first
[1:06:35.840 --> 1:06:42.160]  hour of Governor DeSantis of Florida saying they lied to us about these shots these mRNA
[1:06:42.160 --> 1:06:47.680]  shots they don't work they're hurting people it's all a lie it's a hoax we go down that
[1:06:47.680 --> 1:06:53.800]  path we stop all the poisoning the globalists go to prison the nightmares if not new lockdowns
[1:06:53.800 --> 1:06:59.960]  more forced injections global vaccine passports are already here so I open the phones up and
[1:06:59.960 --> 1:07:05.320]  I ask the question if DeSantis is hitting on all cylinders what do we do about Trump
[1:07:05.320 --> 1:07:09.840]  I like Trump I know they hate him I know he's for real but he's wrong he wanted me he was
[1:07:09.840 --> 1:07:15.080]  wrong about these shots he says he won't say the V word now a month ago but he's still
[1:07:15.080 --> 1:07:20.400]  proud of it what do we do I'm going to get to a lot of callers right now you're all
[1:07:20.400 --> 1:07:25.000]  awesome I'm gonna be each 60 seconds we can move the next person let's talk to spike
[1:07:25.000 --> 1:07:33.160]  in Texas spike you're on the air good afternoon Alex I have a suggestion you know Trump has
[1:07:33.160 --> 1:07:39.560]  got a lot of legal problems right now all right he's getting old he's had a real real
[1:07:39.560 --> 1:07:47.120]  good record of endorsing candidates he should graciously step aside endorse DeSantis and
[1:07:47.120 --> 1:07:55.840]  have MTG as their running mate for vice president I love it why do you think Trump obviously
[1:07:55.840 --> 1:08:01.080]  is not stupid and knows the shot was a lie why is he being pigheaded you know I don't
[1:08:01.080 --> 1:08:05.520]  know whether it's threats against his family or whether he just doesn't listen to people
[1:08:05.520 --> 1:08:10.040]  I don't know but this is a way out of it for him he can step out of the whole mess with
[1:08:10.040 --> 1:08:17.360]  the vaccines by doing this beautifully said spike anything else the prosecutor and the
[1:08:17.360 --> 1:08:25.440]  judge are not human in your trial I hate to tell you they're replicants of some kind well
[1:08:25.440 --> 1:08:31.480]  they sure act like Chuck E cheese animatrons I can't in Florida Ken you're on the air
[1:08:31.480 --> 1:08:40.200]  go ahead yep hey Alex how you doing just portal inside on on Trump and the vaccine are you
[1:08:40.200 --> 1:08:47.240]  there I am sir yep so I am I'm listening a lot but I've never heard this brought up
[1:08:47.240 --> 1:08:56.320]  I read Anthony Fauci I mean Kennedy's book on Anthony Fauci and he expresses in there
[1:08:56.320 --> 1:09:02.000]  that Trump took a million dollars from Pfizer and I just never heard anybody bring that up
[1:09:02.000 --> 1:09:07.240]  he did Trump took campaign money I think it's more than a million yeah so I mean I mean
[1:09:07.240 --> 1:09:13.000]  there you go to me that's you know nobody brings it up and that connects the dots so
[1:09:13.000 --> 1:09:18.600]  anyway that's all I had to say I agree so what should be done what should Trump do shoot
[1:09:18.600 --> 1:09:24.960]  man I don't know either we call them out on it he needs to acknowledge it and of course
[1:09:24.960 --> 1:09:29.840]  this himself himself from it but I mean it's to me it'd be hard to do if you take a million
[1:09:29.840 --> 1:09:35.080]  dollars from the thing of course it was before all this took place so well said sir thank
[1:09:35.080 --> 1:09:41.880]  you for calling let's talk to stony wolf in Michigan stony you're on the air oh hey there
[1:09:41.880 --> 1:09:49.200]  Alex first-time caller do you here's what I think if the Sanis I'll take to Sanis over
[1:09:49.200 --> 1:09:56.080]  Trump if he does not admit to his mistake on the clock shots and that he was hoodwinked
[1:09:56.080 --> 1:10:03.320]  and he stopped the warp speed if he doesn't stop the warp speed and his his gloating that's
[1:10:03.320 --> 1:10:10.560]  his Achilles Achilles heel millions of course have been injured and of course we gotta get
[1:10:10.560 --> 1:10:19.040]  Fosse and Birx out there and put them on trial but I think the good news here is that Trump
[1:10:19.040 --> 1:10:25.280]  at this time is working to boost the primary candidates because he has this massive following
[1:10:25.280 --> 1:10:31.880]  and which would also help the Santas whether he runs as VP or runs as president because
[1:10:31.880 --> 1:10:37.480]  it's going to help create an America first agenda no matter what we know that's the
[1:10:37.480 --> 1:10:41.560]  paradox Trump's getting a lot of good people elected he's trading momentum so he's he's
[1:10:41.560 --> 1:10:47.800]  a flawed vessel but that's why I'm still behind him absolutely yes me too but I'll take them
[1:10:47.800 --> 1:10:54.480]  both but he's got to shut up above them clock shots he just has to shut up about it and
[1:10:54.480 --> 1:11:00.160]  admit it yes and get out of his ego thank you stony great points all right let's go to New
[1:11:00.160 --> 1:11:05.880]  York talk to David David you're on the air go ahead Alex how you doing today good
[1:11:05.880 --> 1:11:13.600]  man hey brother I really like your question I think you're identifying in your question
[1:11:13.600 --> 1:11:19.280]  that we have a void in leadership we're not finding that Martin Luther King someone who
[1:11:19.280 --> 1:11:25.960]  would lead people to really get something done you're right January 6 was a botch and
[1:11:25.960 --> 1:11:32.400]  Trump needs to say yeah brother we appreciate what you've done but your role may not be
[1:11:32.400 --> 1:11:38.840]  being at the head of your movement we need leadership who can mobilize the people to
[1:11:38.840 --> 1:11:43.000]  take this government in this country back and the people are pissed about the poison
[1:11:43.000 --> 1:11:48.040]  shot it doesn't work it hurts people he could decouple and save himself and be a great leader
[1:11:48.040 --> 1:11:53.520]  again how do we put pressure on him to get him to stop it I think you're doing it and
[1:11:53.520 --> 1:11:57.840]  I appreciate it I mean I think he's got to be told it's okay to repent it's okay to say
[1:11:57.840 --> 1:12:03.440]  you were wrong it's okay to say I don't know what to do and maybe somebody else has got
[1:12:03.440 --> 1:12:08.600]  to make this decision for him but you ought to shut up about it until you know if he's
[1:12:08.600 --> 1:12:14.000]  really conflicted about it yes sir thank you all right let's take a call from Virginia
[1:12:14.000 --> 1:12:22.280]  let's talk to owl owl in Virginia you're on the air so I was going I was going back in
[1:12:22.280 --> 1:12:28.040]  watching an old video about ten years old of Webster Tarpley I'll give an interview
[1:12:28.040 --> 1:12:33.400]  to you breaking down eco science with John P. Holdren if Trump does not come out against
[1:12:33.400 --> 1:12:39.880]  the eugenics movement and the great reset nothing else matters because they're just
[1:12:39.880 --> 1:12:43.640]  going to tie him up for four more years and we don't have time for that as much as it's
[1:12:43.640 --> 1:12:49.040]  funny to laugh at Liz Cheney and the rest of the clowns we need him to come out and
[1:12:49.040 --> 1:12:53.880]  address the issues and it somebody needs to give this man a crash course and now that's
[1:12:53.880 --> 1:12:58.320]  the point I meant to make I'm glad you called and say more in a moment don't hang up but
[1:12:58.320 --> 1:13:03.520]  exactly we can celebrate Cheney this evil idiot warmonger daughter not knowing how
[1:13:03.520 --> 1:13:10.680]  stupid she looks losing they had four candidates she got like 29% the other person got 63%
[1:13:10.680 --> 1:13:19.720]  she lost she lost massively she lost just massively but she's a joke our supposed champion
[1:13:19.720 --> 1:13:23.640]  is in bed with them when it comes to these poison shots and it's it's a non-negotiable
[1:13:23.640 --> 1:13:34.080]  issue it's late it's laid out from whether it's Bill Gates talking about using vaccines
[1:13:34.080 --> 1:13:39.960]  or I mean John P. Holdren says in the eco science book using vaccines as a way to lower
[1:13:39.960 --> 1:13:44.280]  population that's right guys the book is in the conference room by the TV I was just

[1:14:23.760 --> 1:14:28.960]  forum and that's why we're not going to get leadership from Donald Trump is because he's
[1:14:28.960 --> 1:14:34.480]  in on it until he proves otherwise he's in on his daughter is the world economic forum

[1:14:44.800 --> 1:14:49.960]  in Trump's working for the other side too we need to realize that we need actual leadership

[1:20:33.120 --> 1:20:39.880]  dot com breaking biden whistleblower exposes secret night flights of illegal immigrant
[1:20:39.880 --> 1:20:45.160]  children thousands of kids per week with no paperwork being given to adults with no paperwork
[1:20:45.160 --> 1:20:50.720]  and no background checks will be playing exclusive clips that she's gotten in her investigations
[1:20:50.720 --> 1:20:54.960]  getting her analysis for being at the border and more but first let's hear jack the sub
[1:20:54.960 --> 1:20:58.560]  it break it down this is according to post one you'll dot com so saav's working with
[1:20:58.560 --> 1:21:04.400]  them to put this all together an anonymous whistleblower has come forward sitting down
[1:21:04.400 --> 1:21:10.800]  with saav Hernandez who works as a travel youth care worker for a federally funded contractor
[1:21:10.800 --> 1:21:16.480]  and shares the tens of thousands of unaccompanied migrant children so two to five thousand a
[1:21:16.480 --> 1:21:22.560]  week are being bust and flown throughout the united states and handed off to quote unvetted
[1:21:22.560 --> 1:21:29.200]  adult sponsors the employee and she actually gives us the name mvm ink said the company's
[1:21:29.200 --> 1:21:34.880]  main focus is getting unaccompanied minors from quote point a shelters to point b sponsors
[1:21:34.880 --> 1:21:39.960]  across the united states however due to the overwhelming number of border crossings the
[1:21:39.960 --> 1:21:45.000]  employees shared that new hires for mvm are not given proper background checks says there's
[1:21:45.000 --> 1:21:49.120]  been a lot of people hired the background hasn't even come in yet but they're already
[1:21:49.120 --> 1:21:54.400]  working this is the same company that was exposed exposed to be flying migrants in
[1:21:54.400 --> 1:21:58.080]  the middle of the night to new york keep in mind by the way in new york city mayor eric
[1:21:58.080 --> 1:22:03.800]  adams just said that these migrants um and we don't know if that's minors or or just
[1:22:03.800 --> 1:22:08.000]  all that are coming into new york city he's going to put them up in a luxury hotel in
[1:22:08.000 --> 1:22:13.040]  new york city's time square that's just so nice of him due to the massive amounts of
[1:22:13.040 --> 1:22:18.960]  this that are pouring across the border employees are not being vetted the people that we handed
[1:22:18.960 --> 1:22:24.520]  off to are not always completely vetted she's even gotten email up and this is incredible
[1:22:24.520 --> 1:22:29.360]  multiple issues that were brought to the mvm site managers attention including ts's and
[1:22:29.360 --> 1:22:36.480]  a ts is a travel escort taking the liberty of quote accepting alternate documents without
[1:22:36.480 --> 1:22:45.360]  approval let's go to 50 000 for you here no serious country would be doing this unless
[1:22:45.360 --> 1:22:51.080]  there were a specific reason you guys you're looking at an operation all right you need
[1:22:51.080 --> 1:22:59.520]  to understand that we are looking at an operation of not only human trafficking but in this case
[1:22:59.520 --> 1:23:05.840]  child trafficking we don't know and they don't know who these children are why they're coming
[1:23:05.840 --> 1:23:14.160]  across the border a 10 year old girl was just raped and impregnated in ohio over this we're
[1:23:14.160 --> 1:23:20.400]  told that her mother may have known something about it the stuff that's going on is completely
[1:23:20.400 --> 1:23:26.040]  insane and the biden regime rather than actually get to the bottom of it or stop it end the
[1:23:26.040 --> 1:23:32.760]  situation they're exacerbating it they're setting up a toxic toxic incentive structure
[1:23:32.760 --> 1:23:40.000]  and people good people honest people are falling into it this needs to stop and this entire
[1:23:40.000 --> 1:23:45.280]  situation needs to be shut down this is government run child smuggling and we tomorrow is today
[1:23:45.280 --> 1:23:49.000]  but now they're for years showing you this them loading children giving babies over to
[1:23:49.000 --> 1:23:53.160]  people with no paperwork savannah and it should be with us the rest of the hour that exclusive
[1:23:53.160 --> 1:23:59.960]  clips coming up but big picture what are we facing here alex after getting this whistleblower
[1:23:59.960 --> 1:24:04.000]  interview and also sitting down with an active national guard member that was willing to put
[1:24:04.000 --> 1:24:07.960]  his entire career on the line to expose the open borders horrors that he's seeing as a
[1:24:07.960 --> 1:24:12.640]  result of joe biden's policy what we're seeing is a mass invasion what we're seeing is our
[1:24:12.640 --> 1:24:17.680]  government coming out and completely trying to derail our country corrupt our country
[1:24:17.680 --> 1:24:21.840]  you know jack the soviet basically just laid out what my entire report was about regarding
[1:24:21.840 --> 1:24:25.920]  employees not receiving proper background checks regarding these children being potentially
[1:24:25.920 --> 1:24:30.200]  housed with cartel members that are passing off as kids and on top of that again just
[1:24:30.200 --> 1:24:36.280]  to reiterate these kids are being handed off to improperly identified adult sponsors so
[1:24:36.280 --> 1:24:41.680]  this is government corruption and like you said essentially child smuggling happening
[1:24:41.680 --> 1:24:46.320]  on a federal level and the amink the same company that was already caught shipping migrants
[1:24:46.320 --> 1:24:51.120]  in the middle of the night to new york city they signed a federal contract with joe biden's
[1:24:51.120 --> 1:24:56.800]  administration back in 2021 for 136 million dollars so i want people to understand that
[1:24:56.800 --> 1:25:00.960]  the biggest and most sinister angle of this story is that we are passing off innocent
[1:25:00.960 --> 1:25:07.080]  children to unvetted improperly identified adults via our taxpayer dollars joe biden
[1:25:07.080 --> 1:25:11.560]  funding all of this and again just to reiterate those numbers as well my source saying they
[1:25:11.560 --> 1:25:15.760]  moved between two to five thousand children per week and that's just in his office there
[1:25:15.760 --> 1:25:20.920]  are four or five offices in texas for mvm ink so that total store around eight to ten thousand
[1:25:20.920 --> 1:25:26.000]  children per week estimates of 30 to 40 thousand children per month my source saying that as
[1:25:26.000 --> 1:25:30.520]  well oftentimes these children will come through the system two times because their sponsors
[1:25:30.520 --> 1:25:34.880]  decide that they don't want them anymore alexa what we're seeing right now is unprecedented
[1:25:34.880 --> 1:25:40.400]  in numbers of children being used as a tool to you know for illegal immigrants to make
[1:25:40.400 --> 1:25:44.600]  money off of another point that i wanted to make and i wanted to highlight with this because
[1:25:44.600 --> 1:25:50.800]  i asked my source why would one of these illegal immigrants want to be a sponsor for some of
[1:25:50.800 --> 1:25:54.640]  these children and it's because the office of refugee resettlement is giving them this
[1:25:54.640 --> 1:25:58.640]  document i provided that with the crew if they want to put this up but basically what
[1:25:58.640 --> 1:26:02.720]  this document is is when these kids are coming across the border the government is issuing
[1:26:02.720 --> 1:26:06.960]  them their own form of social security number so these kids can enroll in schools and then
[1:26:06.960 --> 1:26:11.280]  they're putting the sponsors identification on this paper as well the sponsors oftentimes
[1:26:11.280 --> 1:26:15.120]  asking when these kids are being handed over to them hey where is this paper because these
[1:26:15.120 --> 1:26:20.120]  sponsors are then going to sanctuary cities they're using this form of federal identification
[1:26:20.120 --> 1:26:24.720]  to go get driver's license to be a part of america to utilize our resources every single
[1:26:24.720 --> 1:26:29.120]  day and again the tax payers are funding it and they're not vetting they're not vetting
[1:26:29.120 --> 1:26:34.400]  any of we have that famous visual play later where we go in with undercover cop in mcallin
[1:26:34.400 --> 1:26:38.920]  and we show this happening and the man comes out and says yeah i'm here to get kids he
[1:26:38.920 --> 1:26:44.400]  says and these load kids in with some creepy dude in a van who drives off and this one
[1:26:44.400 --> 1:26:49.160]  that we got on kate you know delivering babies to the airport with no id just hands them
[1:26:49.160 --> 1:26:54.600]  off and they say is this your baby she goes yes it's my baby then she hands over child
[1:26:54.600 --> 1:27:01.960]  it for child i mean this is unbelievable exactly elix and what of the i mean when you check
[1:27:01.960 --> 1:27:07.200]  into a hotel or get rent a car they want your documents but when it's or flan an airplane
[1:27:07.200 --> 1:27:14.640]  tsa but but on the border here's little kids just hand them all out exactly elix and during
[1:27:14.640 --> 1:27:18.120]  this interview one of the most sinister quotes one of the most shocking things that i heard
[1:27:18.120 --> 1:27:23.000]  from the eyewitness account of this employee was and i quote we knew at the beginning that
[1:27:23.000 --> 1:27:26.760]  we were handing these kids off to families we knew it was a family reunification because
[1:27:26.760 --> 1:27:30.080]  they would be crying they would be hugging you could tell they were excited to see each
[1:27:30.080 --> 1:27:34.280]  other now they're handing these kids off to these adult sponsors the sponsors aren't
[1:27:34.280 --> 1:27:38.000]  even looking at the kid the children coming forward and then admitting yeah i'm not related
[1:27:38.000 --> 1:27:42.160]  to this person yeah nambla nambla sponsors we're gonna play these clips coming up tell
[1:27:42.160 --> 1:27:47.280]  us about a few of these exclusive clips we're about to play sure elix so the clips that
[1:27:47.280 --> 1:27:51.680]  i sent over to the crew are again this employee's eyewitness account of what he has heard from
[1:27:51.680 --> 1:27:55.800]  children of him passing off children to adults that they again they don't know they're not
[1:27:55.800 --> 1:28:02.200]  related to absolutely horrific it's his eyewitness account of these adult sponsors not being
[1:28:02.200 --> 1:28:07.680]  thoroughly vetted not being given background checks so again these kids having to be handled
[1:28:07.680 --> 1:28:11.440]  by employees who are not being given proper background checks my own source saying he worked
[1:28:11.440 --> 1:28:15.800]  with the company for over six months before being given a background check cartel members
[1:28:15.800 --> 1:28:20.160]  throwing their identification away at the border so that way they can get into the u s
[1:28:20.160 --> 1:28:26.160]  easier those cartel members passing off his children so these other migrant kids potentially
[1:28:26.160 --> 1:28:30.680]  being housed with them and then to top it all off these employees not being properly
[1:28:30.680 --> 1:28:35.360]  trained handing these kids over to adults that are not being properly identified that
[1:28:35.360 --> 1:28:39.320]  are not even all right savannah hernandez stay right there stay right there everybody

[1:34:32.040 --> 1:34:39.540]  party lawsuits how do i stay on the attack and it's simple it's because i get to know
[1:34:39.540 --> 1:34:48.880]  people like savannah hernandez and tucker carlson and bolson aro and all these other
[1:34:48.880 --> 1:34:54.400]  great souls of every race color and creed who are humans who i love who are brothers

[1:37:44.800 --> 1:37:50.360]  and watch the mass smuggling for you you don't have to wait around it's not like it's just
[1:37:50.360 --> 1:37:56.800]  happening everywhere using little children as a get out of jail free card is insane
[1:37:56.800 --> 1:38:00.920]  exactly alex and another whistleblower interview that i recently conducted viewers can also
[1:38:00.920 --> 1:38:05.680]  find this on my band.video channel saf says was with an active national guardsman and
[1:38:05.680 --> 1:38:10.680]  he provided me with a video that he took of a young seven-year-old migrant girl who was
[1:38:10.680 --> 1:38:15.680]  abandoned at the border of the human smugglers that she was with threw her into some barbed
[1:38:15.680 --> 1:38:20.280]  wire and left her there for border patrol and national guard to find so this is what national
[1:38:20.280 --> 1:38:25.880]  guard is seeing every single day stories as well of abandoned seven-month-old babies at
[1:38:25.880 --> 1:38:31.600]  the border the cartel is well you know dipping men's bodies in acid mutilating these bodies
[1:38:31.600 --> 1:38:35.480]  and then throwing them onto the u.s. side of the border or crossing over and leaving them
[1:38:35.480 --> 1:38:39.760]  on the u.s. side of the border as an intimidation tactic just to give viewers an idea of who
[1:38:39.760 --> 1:38:45.040]  the cartel is and how far they're willing to go to intimidate our law enforcement officers
[1:38:45.040 --> 1:38:48.800]  so they're mishandling children they're trafficking children they're putting children in these
[1:38:48.800 --> 1:38:52.920]  horrible situations the cartel is running rampant at the border right now the wall street
[1:38:52.920 --> 1:38:56.080]  journal just came out with an article that said in the fiscal year of twenty twenty
[1:38:56.080 --> 1:39:00.600]  two there were almost two million illegal immigrants in just one year that crossed over
[1:39:00.600 --> 1:39:05.440]  because of Joe Biden's open border policy and again we have all of these them democratic
[1:39:05.440 --> 1:39:09.680]  governors like Muriel Bowser and Eric Adams coming forward and saying oh it's Republican
[1:39:09.680 --> 1:39:13.400]  governors that are busing illegal immigrants to our states and to our sanctuary cities
[1:39:13.400 --> 1:39:18.240]  no it's not I actually interviewed again the employee of one of these companies and he
[1:39:18.240 --> 1:39:22.800]  said no it's actually us it's the Biden administration that is funding all of this it's the Biden
[1:39:22.800 --> 1:39:26.760]  administration that is paying for us to put two to three hundred children on a charter
[1:39:26.760 --> 1:39:30.920]  flight that we're sending to New York to California to Oregon to Washington again all of this
[1:39:30.920 --> 1:39:34.840]  happening in the middle of the night set up and we're gonna play the exclusive clip next
[1:39:34.840 --> 1:39:40.000]  segment but but here's a clip going viral little two minute nine second clip of the
[1:39:40.000 --> 1:39:44.440]  kids being smuggled across the border here it is for those of us in the audience who
[1:39:44.440 --> 1:39:49.320]  might not know what NVM Inc is can you explain to us what your company is and what they do
[1:39:49.320 --> 1:39:57.960]  it's a company that focuses on getting uh they call it UCs unaccompanied children unaccompanied
[1:39:57.960 --> 1:40:04.120]  minors getting them from point A to point B and most of the time point A is from a
[1:40:04.120 --> 1:40:13.440]  shelter uh all of all two of Texas and all across the country and point B is with a sponsor
[1:40:13.440 --> 1:40:19.440]  most of the time it's family member but maybe the numbers are so crazy that it's no longer
[1:40:19.440 --> 1:40:26.920]  family members it's family friends uh people who are willing to take them in and a lot
[1:40:26.920 --> 1:40:34.240]  of the times they don't even know each other so my job is to show up I get a new folder
[1:40:34.240 --> 1:40:41.320]  that tells me where I'm going who's my partner and where we're gonna be picking kids up and
[1:40:41.320 --> 1:40:47.760]  my job is to be with them on airplanes be with them on the buses sometimes it's buses
[1:40:47.760 --> 1:40:53.600]  and sometimes it's charter planes when it's charter planes we move anywhere between 200
[1:40:53.600 --> 1:40:59.840]  to 300 kids on one plane it won't just be one plane it will be two or three planes at
[1:40:59.840 --> 1:41:08.200]  a time that leave I do know that when we start off we'll drop off in Texas so we'll go from
[1:41:08.200 --> 1:41:14.720]  one plane in Texas to another and then these same charter planes we'll go to New York we'll
[1:41:14.720 --> 1:41:20.480]  go to California we'll go to Washington and then they'll finish off in Oregon or another
[1:41:20.480 --> 1:41:27.000]  state nearby so it's not just one state it's not just one drop off you go to one destination
[1:41:27.000 --> 1:41:32.160]  drop off the kids are getting off there and then you continue on so if you could give
[1:41:32.160 --> 1:41:37.720]  us an estimate how many children per month you think are being moved just in the Texas
[1:41:37.720 --> 1:41:46.280]  area like I said it's between all the offices it's in the thousands I say 8 to 10 but that's
[1:41:46.280 --> 1:41:54.600]  in one week so in the months I would say around 40,000 30,000 kids 30 to 40,000 children
[1:41:54.600 --> 1:42:01.040]  a month being given away to perfect strangers with no record this is Jeffrey Epstein Island
[1:42:01.040 --> 1:42:08.720]  on warp speed Savannah Hernandez exactly Alex and my source as well telling me that oftentimes
[1:42:08.720 --> 1:42:14.000]  these sponsors will decide that they don't want this child anymore the adults their parents
[1:42:14.000 --> 1:42:17.520]  will decide yeah I don't want to have to take care of this child anymore so then they'll
[1:42:17.520 --> 1:42:22.360]  put them back into the system so even with this 30 to 40,000 number of children that
[1:42:22.360 --> 1:42:26.800]  we're seeing being transported across the country oftentimes this is the same child
[1:42:26.800 --> 1:42:33.520]  that is being put through the social welfare system God these people are evil if the left
[1:42:33.520 --> 1:42:37.360]  can't abort them before they're born they're going to run them through hell now God I would
[1:42:37.360 --> 1:42:42.520]  want to be these leftist the left are just satanic pedophile monsters but whistleblowers
[1:42:42.520 --> 1:42:46.800]  and investigative journalists like Savannah Hernandez and platforms to expose it are
[1:42:46.800 --> 1:42:51.160]  going to bring them down that's why keeping us on air folks is so critical we're going

[1:47:14.280 --> 1:47:20.000]  three and a half years ago right out of college in texas he hired savannah hernandez then
[1:47:20.000 --> 1:47:25.600]  she left to go work for some of the biggest catering organizations in america and now
[1:47:25.600 --> 1:47:31.360]  you can see her becoming a major investigative journalist in the fight against tyranny info
[1:47:31.360 --> 1:47:39.160]  wars mission is finding the leaders and giving them the platform to launch from I literally
[1:47:39.160 --> 1:47:44.920]  had a vision 25 years ago sitting in waterloo house house eating a chicken fried steak and
[1:47:44.920 --> 1:47:51.600]  drinking a iced tea by myself and I saw the future and the message was you are to build
[1:47:51.600 --> 1:47:56.080]  the platform to launch the generation of leaders to fight the new world order at the critical
[1:47:56.080 --> 1:48:00.960]  point they try to take over that really happened I told you for decades of that happened and
[1:48:00.960 --> 1:48:11.600]  now you're witnessing the stories up on info wars.com deHS whistleblower lays out and exposes
[1:48:11.600 --> 1:48:15.680]  the secret night flights of illegal immigrant children thousands of kids per week being
[1:48:15.680 --> 1:48:21.000]  given to people with no IDs savannah hernandez we just played that powerful clip of the whistleblower
[1:48:21.000 --> 1:48:26.480]  we've got an exclusive clip here talking about the kids being moved and the sponsors email
[1:48:26.480 --> 1:48:29.240]  tell us about this clip.
[1:48:29.240 --> 1:48:33.880]  So alex what this clip entails is again that email that corroborates that yes these employees
[1:48:33.880 --> 1:48:38.440]  are handing these children off to improperly identified adults I actually reached out to
[1:48:38.440 --> 1:48:42.640]  the company for comment and of course mvm being said well this is factually false because
[1:48:42.640 --> 1:48:46.160]  of course it goes into the verbiage right they use this on a technicality where they
[1:48:46.160 --> 1:48:51.240]  try to say oh well it's not our responsibility to sponsor or to let these sponsors that's
[1:48:51.240 --> 1:48:56.480]  the office of refugee resettlements job but it is the employees jobs to identify the adults
[1:48:56.480 --> 1:49:02.200]  that they're handing which is the stop there back up 30 seconds which is the sorrow sky
[1:49:02.200 --> 1:49:07.400]  that ran the european invasion the NGOs are in charge of the board of patrol they certify
[1:49:07.400 --> 1:49:12.480]  the fraud and the board of patrol has to follow the orders of the president.
[1:49:12.480 --> 1:49:17.680]  Actually alex this is corruption at again the highest levels in our government so knowing
[1:49:17.680 --> 1:49:21.520]  that these kids are being passed off to adults that are being improperly identified is horrifying
[1:49:21.520 --> 1:49:27.080]  but it's not surprising in the slightest and that's what again this email corroborates.
[1:49:27.080 --> 1:49:30.120]  What is it like for you because I'm going to talk about yourself but your journey you've
[1:49:30.120 --> 1:49:34.720]  talked about it before but coming here to work not you know being a smart lady but being
[1:49:34.720 --> 1:49:39.080]  very young out of college what is your learning curve been because it's been amazing you've
[1:49:39.080 --> 1:49:43.480]  gone from really awesome we first hired you to like Obi-Wan Kenobi level in just three
[1:49:43.480 --> 1:49:48.960]  years well what has that process been like alex again I always say it on your show and
[1:49:48.960 --> 1:49:52.400]  I'll say it again that I have you to thank I always tell people was classically trained
[1:49:52.400 --> 1:49:56.400]  by alex jones one of the most important things that you taught me is to just be there be
[1:49:56.400 --> 1:50:00.800]  on the ground and be give a voice to my fellow americans one of the most important things
[1:50:00.800 --> 1:50:04.880]  that you taught me into anybody listening who wants to get into this understand that nobody
[1:50:04.880 --> 1:50:08.640]  wants polish people anymore okay we don't want people that are reading off of a teleprompter
[1:50:08.640 --> 1:50:13.080]  we don't want these politicians that are polished and pretty and say exactly what they're supposed
[1:50:13.080 --> 1:50:17.440]  to and follow the narrative no we want people like alex jones we want that type of energy
[1:50:17.440 --> 1:50:20.880]  the people who are going to fight for this country fight for their fellow men give them
[1:50:20.880 --> 1:50:25.960]  a voice and stand up to government corruption so again alex the reason why I think the journey
[1:50:25.960 --> 1:50:29.960]  has been so successful is because I got to be trained under you initially you're one
[1:50:29.960 --> 1:50:33.480]  of the most popular people right now because you have been consistently right because do
[1:50:33.480 --> 1:50:37.760]  not wait for the mainstream media to give you permission to report on certain stories
[1:50:37.760 --> 1:50:41.800]  or facts you were always the first one doing it and that's the most important thing that
[1:50:41.800 --> 1:50:45.800]  you taught me and that's why even some of my my clips have made it onto tucker carlson
[1:50:45.800 --> 1:50:49.240]  because for example when I saw that there was a baby formula shortage I thought what
[1:50:49.240 --> 1:50:53.480]  would alex do alex would immediately go to the grocery stores and take video of what's
[1:50:53.480 --> 1:50:58.000]  going on shoot a report about it and go talk to fellow americans and again multiple of
[1:50:58.000 --> 1:51:02.600]  my clips used on tucker show because of that mentality that you taught me so anybody watching
[1:51:02.600 --> 1:51:08.720]  right now as well understand that americans want the truth americans want the brunt abrasive
[1:51:08.720 --> 1:51:13.840]  truth right it's not pretty all the time but this is the type of format that americans
[1:51:13.840 --> 1:51:17.800]  love and why are we seeing so many of these america first politicians so widely popular
[1:51:17.800 --> 1:51:22.720]  like kerry lake you know ron desantis Blake masters joe kent it's because they're real
[1:51:22.720 --> 1:51:27.240]  life people alex and again we all took a page out of your book we decided to throw away
[1:51:27.240 --> 1:51:31.240]  the teleprompters we decided to throw away the lights the camera the makeup and just say
[1:51:31.240 --> 1:51:35.480]  you know what this is what's going on in america and we need a fight for it well all the credit
[1:51:35.480 --> 1:51:40.360]  goes to listeners backing us and so the enemy thinks they're going to shut us down they might
[1:51:40.360 --> 1:51:45.640]  be able to but they'll never shut down how we were an example to others and I'm so proud
[1:51:45.640 --> 1:51:49.960]  of that I'm so proud of the listeners who deserve more credit than I do for backing us
[1:51:49.960 --> 1:51:54.080]  because without them it wouldn't have happened let's go ahead and play a few minutes of this
[1:51:54.080 --> 1:51:59.880]  exclusive clip here this is the ig sponsors email and 30 seconds tell us what this clip
[1:51:59.880 --> 1:52:06.960]  is so again alex this clip is the email corroboration that these employees are handing off children
[1:52:06.960 --> 1:52:11.200]  to improperly identified adults that they're not related to and they have they've never
[1:52:11.200 --> 1:52:17.200]  met before so that's what this is the smoking gun of illegal child trafficking being ordered
[1:52:17.200 --> 1:52:21.800]  to the border patrol that run by NGOs that run the operation under soros here is the
[1:52:21.800 --> 1:52:27.360]  mass trafficking that makes jeffrey eppstein blush this is a thousand a ten thousand times
[1:52:27.360 --> 1:52:31.320]  we're talking forty thousand a month in texas alone a million times jeffrey eppstein here
[1:52:31.320 --> 1:52:37.080]  it is so when you land in these cities um you're meeting these sponsors that are there
[1:52:37.080 --> 1:52:42.880]  to pick up the children all right and when we get to these cities we're told to wait
[1:52:42.880 --> 1:52:48.680]  for them the values claim regarding the sponsors as well like how are the children tied to these
[1:52:48.680 --> 1:52:54.240]  sponsors yes so the children give the name to the to the people of the shelters and the
[1:52:54.240 --> 1:53:00.920]  shelters will reach out to this person and then they will they have they have their process
[1:53:00.920 --> 1:53:09.680]  that is very easy to how can you say when they look into the person if they see they're
[1:53:09.680 --> 1:53:14.680]  not related they don't care they'll prove it and they send the kid off to this person
[1:53:14.680 --> 1:53:18.920]  and the sponsor will tell us oh i'm not a family member i'm not the kid's father i'm
[1:53:18.920 --> 1:53:23.960]  not the kid's mother i'm not blood related it's just a friend and it makes you wonder
[1:53:23.960 --> 1:53:31.120]  like what do you mean just a friend like who are you but we're not allowed to to to bring
[1:53:31.120 --> 1:53:36.480]  these things up as long as it's a person on the paper as long as it's a person who shows
[1:53:36.480 --> 1:53:43.280]  up and gives you the proper documentation then we leave the child so when we first started
[1:53:43.280 --> 1:53:50.440]  doing this they were always family members and a lot of the times now kids will say it
[1:53:50.440 --> 1:53:55.480]  or we find out ourselves that they're not related in the beginning we can easily tell
[1:53:55.480 --> 1:54:01.720]  that it was a family because they would cry they would hold them but now it's no more
[1:54:01.720 --> 1:54:07.040]  crying no more hugging it's just hey i'm here to pick you up and that's it they won't look
[1:54:07.040 --> 1:54:13.880]  at the kid they will be upset that they have to show up to the airport and it just it's
[1:54:13.880 --> 1:54:20.160]  weird it's very weird inside and frustrating because you get to know the kid throughout
[1:54:20.160 --> 1:54:24.680]  the day and you want to be happy for them but then when you get to where you're going
[1:54:24.680 --> 1:54:30.800]  and you're like this is the person that they approved like it's kind of upsetting i'm guessing
[1:54:30.800 --> 1:54:35.920]  they're overwhelmed and they can't find family members and if they can't find family members
[1:54:35.920 --> 1:54:40.160]  they want to get these kids out of the shelter as soon as possible so they won't prove
[1:54:40.160 --> 1:54:45.280]  anybody that the kids say hey i want to go with him or i want to go with her you said
[1:54:45.280 --> 1:54:49.360]  that you guys are so overwhelmed right now overwhelmed to the point where mvm ink is
[1:54:49.360 --> 1:54:54.720]  mass hiring people and they're not being properly trained which is leading to negligence when
[1:54:54.720 --> 1:54:59.120]  it comes to identifying these children and their sponsors properly can can you talk
[1:54:59.120 --> 1:55:05.000]  to us about that it's one of the emails that i showed you it's an email where they're
[1:55:05.000 --> 1:55:12.240]  pinpointing that hey you guys are accepting stuff that was the IDs that were not approved
[1:55:12.240 --> 1:55:18.240]  you are guys are letting these kids go with people who are not on the list who were not
[1:55:18.240 --> 1:55:23.680]  approved and sometimes there are people who were not even on any documents for the child
[1:55:24.480 --> 1:55:30.480]  and it tends to happen where these sponsors will show up and they will say uh i'm here
[1:55:30.480 --> 1:55:35.760]  for the kid but it's really the sister or a neighbor because the sponsor didn't feel like
[1:55:35.760 --> 1:55:42.240]  going and these kids are being sent off with neighbors with people who who are nowhere near
[1:55:42.240 --> 1:55:47.920]  related to these kids and it's just a mess right now none none of the rules that we're supposed to
[1:55:47.920 --> 1:55:53.760]  follow are being followed and that's why that email that notice went out saying hey you guys
[1:55:54.480 --> 1:56:00.400]  need to pick it up and you guys need to accept the proper documentation i want to see if you
[1:56:00.400 --> 1:56:06.640]  say the biggest thing is what's going on right now is too many uh border crossings too many kids
[1:56:07.920 --> 1:56:12.880]  and these companies will take all this money from taxpayer money and the millions
[1:56:12.880 --> 1:56:20.720]  but they won't do the hiring process the right way a lot of people get hired and their background
[1:56:20.720 --> 1:56:26.960]  hasn't even come in yet don't get emails a month or two months into the job saying hey you need
[1:56:26.960 --> 1:56:32.400]  to do your background and it's crazy because you know it could be a child defender it could be a
[1:56:32.400 --> 1:56:39.280]  bad person and they have access to kids every day if we allow this to continue it's on us
[1:56:39.280 --> 1:56:48.240]  us biden told the third world to come here the un set up the basis they did it and now it's happening
[1:56:48.240 --> 1:56:52.720]  when we come back i'm going to show you a clip from a year and a half ago in mcallin texas
[1:56:52.720 --> 1:56:57.360]  where a man comes out to confront us because they undercover police inside while he's ready

[2:00:27.920 --> 2:00:33.360]  over to random people and flown all over the u.s. for democratic party this again is is
[2:00:33.360 --> 2:00:39.600]  is of times bigger than jeffrey ebbstein and it's just being done and it's so evil we can't admit
[2:00:39.600 --> 2:00:48.320]  it's happening but the children are calling out to god for justice and we are who god works through
[2:00:48.320 --> 2:00:53.520]  savannah hernandez incredible job of these clubs please join us again tomorrow because everybody's
[2:00:53.520 --> 2:00:58.640]  focused on trump and the marlago raid i don't give a damn about that that's it's bad but whatever
[2:00:59.200 --> 2:01:04.400]  we need trump and we need everybody talking about the human smuggling and the elite the illegal
[2:01:04.400 --> 2:01:10.320]  activity happening so closing comments about hernandez a hundred percent agree alex everybody's
[2:01:10.320 --> 2:01:15.600]  focused in on the uh trump fbi raid but again there's bigger issues going on here uh in this
[2:01:15.600 --> 2:01:20.160]  country right now we need to be focused in on saving our children and again uh just with the
[2:01:20.160 --> 2:01:24.560]  border right that crisis in itself is horrible but then we also need to focus in on the sexualization
[2:01:24.560 --> 2:01:29.520]  of our children in schools be targeting of our children by the lgbtq community we need to focus
[2:01:29.520 --> 2:01:33.600]  in on the fact that you know children are still experiencing the repercussion of the government
[2:01:33.600 --> 2:01:38.880]  and forced color 19 lockdowns of the vaccine side effects so we need to stand up but we need to save
[2:01:38.880 --> 2:01:43.440]  uh the kids nationwide and worldwide if this is not something that we can rally behind the
[2:01:43.440 --> 2:01:48.000]  innocence of children and saving them then we're a lost country so we need to keep this at the
[2:01:48.000 --> 2:01:52.480]  forefront elix again thank you for highlighting this story and making sure that it was seen
[2:01:52.480 --> 2:01:57.360]  by the masses don't take me you're you're doing we're supposed to do this i mean
[2:01:58.880 --> 2:02:02.880]  you're a great person i'm not i'm not used to it because the mainstream media doesn't typically
[2:02:02.880 --> 2:02:06.880]  focus on this type of no but all i'm saying is i think what you're saying is we're we're supposed
[2:02:06.880 --> 2:02:13.040]  to defend the children i know you are but like think how sick this is yeah a hundred percent

[2:02:36.720 --> 2:02:42.320]  of these damn pedophiles exactly their whole energy is pedophile their whole energy is rape
[2:02:42.320 --> 2:02:47.840]  of children they are vampirically drinking their innocence in fact i mentioned this here's this
[2:02:47.840 --> 2:02:52.640]  slime bag coming out uh year and a half ago about the kids he's picking up here it is
[2:02:52.640 --> 2:02:59.200]  and they're gonna be permitted because and we're because we're not in control that we can't stop
[2:02:59.200 --> 2:03:07.440]  me so we can either pay for it or pay for it that's the way how to get it i know that's what i'm trying
[2:03:07.440 --> 2:03:14.880]  i mean because we're all we're stuck in for one way or another yeah but they feel privileged they
[2:03:14.880 --> 2:03:20.080]  feel entitled and after speaking to people in there they're not they don't they don't care to
[2:03:20.080 --> 2:03:24.960]  pick me up after themselves you'll be all married for free and they don't care
[2:03:24.960 --> 2:03:31.200]  now so we have some that all right that's mainly on the developer, commercial developer,
[2:03:31.200 --> 2:03:36.880]  restaurant owner that's constantly creating new businesses and we can't allow people to stop
[2:03:37.680 --> 2:03:43.200]  so we provide commercial affidavits for support so therefore but they gotta work
[2:03:43.200 --> 2:03:49.680]  like ma's the flame these are the people coming and getting the children
[2:03:50.800 --> 2:03:55.840]  he came out to confront a savannah and it's absolutely disgusting elix because i want to
[2:03:55.840 --> 2:04:00.560]  hone in on a point that you made earlier too right we were forced to pay for abortions via our
[2:04:00.560 --> 2:04:04.800]  taxpayer dollars and now that that kind of went away because of the overturner of evade now we're
[2:04:04.800 --> 2:04:09.280]  being forced to pay for the trafficking of children across the country via our open borders via these
[2:04:09.280 --> 2:04:14.160]  NGOs so americans need to wake up and get angry with how these taxpayer dollars are being allocated
[2:04:14.160 --> 2:04:17.840]  more importantly how these children are being shipped throughout the us in the middle of the
[2:04:17.840 --> 2:04:23.760]  night under this administration people need to get loud get angry and again share this report so
[2:04:23.760 --> 2:04:28.240]  americans all across the country can understand what's really going on savannah i want to go
[2:04:28.240 --> 2:04:33.120]  with you in the next few weeks to the board let's go together definitely elix let's go yuma is still
[2:04:33.120 --> 2:04:36.640]  crazy they're trying to close the border up but again this is still a very big issue the last
[2:04:36.640 --> 2:04:41.840]  time i was in yuma saw a little three-year-old child wandering around around alone absolutely
[2:04:41.840 --> 2:04:46.800]  mortified terrified and traumatized because he was abandoned in the desert by these smugglers

[2:06:35.200 --> 2:06:39.760]  yeah it's kind of weird i mean they they grabbed some alex jones's texts the other day and the
[2:06:39.760 --> 2:06:45.440]  line is that alex jones is the real criminal not jeffrey fc right but the second they got his texts
[2:06:45.440 --> 2:06:49.200]  you know you you know everything everything embarrassing thing he's ever said of course
[2:06:49.200 --> 2:06:54.240]  is going to be in the new york times but they are affirmatively protecting jeffrey ebbstein
[2:06:54.240 --> 2:06:59.040]  who's not even alive anymore i just i it's just one of the weirdest things i've ever seen
[2:06:59.920 --> 2:07:09.680]  you saw what happened today the fbi arrested a group of militiamen who had a plan to go in
[2:07:09.680 --> 2:07:17.200]  and to kidnap the governor of mission you were saying the news tonight
[2:07:18.080 --> 2:07:23.360]  good afternoon earlier today attorney general dana nestle was joined by officials from the
[2:07:23.360 --> 2:07:30.240]  department of justice and the fbi to announce state and federal charges against 13 members
[2:07:30.240 --> 2:07:36.080]  of two militia groups who are preparing to kidnap and possibly kill me these guys are
[2:07:36.080 --> 2:07:42.240]  hatching violent and deranged schemes like the one against governor widmer that the fbi and local
[2:07:42.240 --> 2:07:48.400]  law enforcement uncovered and stopped last week you know it's a sort of behavior you might expect
[2:07:48.400 --> 2:07:54.400]  from isis and it shouldn't shock the conscience of every america it's a sort of behavior you might
[2:07:54.400 --> 2:08:03.280]  expect from isis and it should shock the conscience of our american failure to condemn these folks
[2:08:03.280 --> 2:08:11.040]  is stunning and refused to condemn white supremacists and hate groups like these two
[2:08:11.040 --> 2:08:18.000]  michigan militia groups this is serious stuff attacking governor widmer on the same day this
[2:08:18.000 --> 2:08:24.400]  plot was exposed it's despicable and the president's saying things in my debate with him like
[2:08:25.440 --> 2:08:32.080]  to the proud boys and all white supremacist group stand down but stand ready and he said
[2:08:32.080 --> 2:08:41.760]  i'll tell us stand back and stand by i just told him to stand down and stand by he said stand back
[2:08:41.760 --> 2:08:49.120]  and stand down but stand ready stand back and stand by he told them we're grateful to the fbi
[2:08:49.120 --> 2:08:55.840]  and law enforcement to discover these domestic terrorists and stop them thank you to the fearless
[2:08:55.840 --> 2:09:04.320]  fbi agents
[2:09:09.200 --> 2:09:12.320]  all the way down i was watching as if there were detonators
[2:09:12.320 --> 2:09:20.320]  floor by floor instead of popping out
[2:09:20.320 --> 2:09:34.880]  i saw from the corner boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom just like 20 straight
[2:09:34.880 --> 2:09:43.200]  hits just went down and as the bombs are gone people just started running and i sat there and
[2:09:43.200 --> 2:09:48.000]  watched a few of them explode and i just turned around and i just started running for my life
[2:09:48.000 --> 2:09:54.320]  because at that point world trade center was coming right down from the corner boom boom boom boom
[2:09:56.960 --> 2:10:12.320]  the bombs have gone people just started running and i sat there and watched a few of them explode
[2:10:12.320 --> 2:10:17.760]  ruthless criminals they're all out and they fund the radical muslims they
[2:10:17.760 --> 2:10:19.760]  attack America
[2:10:19.760 --> 2:10:23.560]  they attack our free speech, they attack who we are
[2:10:23.560 --> 2:10:25.920]  but humanity's waking up
[2:10:25.920 --> 2:10:28.480]  and aware of it
[2:10:28.480 --> 2:10:30.480]  they'll never get away with it
[2:10:30.480 --> 2:10:34.000]  because no matter what happens in four wars, you will continue on
[2:10:34.000 --> 2:10:40.500]  in the fight
[2:10:40.500 --> 2:10:42.960]  alright, we're gonna go to your phone calls now
[2:10:42.960 --> 2:10:45.520]  the only way that a building can accelerate
[2:10:45.520 --> 2:10:49.040]  as it collapses is by having pre-engineered
[2:10:49.040 --> 2:10:53.240]  precisely timed and precisely placed explosives
[2:10:53.240 --> 2:11:00.240]  in other words, controlled demolition
[2:11:00.640 --> 2:11:02.920]  stay in attack formation
[2:11:02.920 --> 2:11:04.800]  I'm on the leader
[2:11:04.800 --> 2:11:08.000]  let's go ahead and take your phone calls, Bo
[2:11:08.000 --> 2:11:11.200]  in Arizona, you're on the air, welcome
[2:11:11.200 --> 2:11:13.520]  hey, Mr. Jones, coming through alright?
[2:11:13.520 --> 2:11:15.640]  I'll declare, brother
[2:11:15.640 --> 2:11:19.520]  alright, it's an honor to finally get through to you and get to chat with you
[2:11:19.520 --> 2:11:23.080]  I just wanted to plug real quick the vitamin mineral fusion
[2:11:23.080 --> 2:11:26.200]  our construction, it's the only way I can
[2:11:26.200 --> 2:11:29.760]  my water retention is through the roof taking this stuff, so I just made a huge
[2:11:29.760 --> 2:11:33.600]  order along with the book and I just got Alex's war, I can't wait to watch it tonight
[2:11:33.600 --> 2:11:36.960]  thank you for keeping us on air in the fight, brother, I love you
[2:11:36.960 --> 2:11:39.240]  yes, sir, thanks for spearheading
[2:11:39.240 --> 2:11:42.600]  with the Trump DeSantis thing
[2:11:42.600 --> 2:11:47.960]  Trump's hubris has always been in his way
[2:11:47.960 --> 2:11:51.440]  and I think the only way really left to get through to him
[2:11:51.440 --> 2:11:54.880]  is through his faith and letting him know
[2:11:54.880 --> 2:11:59.360]  now that you aren't even saying vaccine, you are becoming complicit
[2:11:59.360 --> 2:12:03.800]  in this whole thing and killing people
[2:12:03.800 --> 2:12:11.600]  and eventually God is going to pull back his shield of protection
[2:12:11.600 --> 2:12:15.800]  so I think that's the only way if someone could get through to him on a
[2:12:15.800 --> 2:12:17.920]  Christ-based level
[2:12:17.920 --> 2:12:22.800]  I don't, outside of that, I don't know, I mean, you know, we hope and we pray
[2:12:22.800 --> 2:12:27.720]  DeSantis is doing great things, if he did move out of the way like a caller said earlier, wow, that would be
[2:12:27.720 --> 2:12:33.480]  impressive, I'd love to see NGT or Lauren Boebert or something like that with a VP nomination
[2:12:33.480 --> 2:12:35.400]  well, we love you, thanks for holding
[2:12:35.400 --> 2:12:38.440]  let's talk to Steve in Colorado, Steve, go ahead
[2:12:38.440 --> 2:12:44.760]  hey Alex, good to hear from you, we're praying for you brother, the blood of the Lord Jesus Christ over your life
[2:12:44.760 --> 2:12:51.160]  we're protecting you with prayer and I am so glad to be on the air to tell you some things that have been on my heart
[2:12:51.160 --> 2:12:57.600]  well, let me first thank you, Steve, for those prayers because without you we wouldn't be here, thank you
[2:12:57.600 --> 2:13:03.800]  yeah, we're lifting you up, Psalm 91, you know, getting back to the Trump question your caller just mentioned
[2:13:03.800 --> 2:13:12.040]  something, I have a biblical reference and model here, in 1 Chronicles chapter 21, King David, he was a good man
[2:13:12.040 --> 2:13:18.840]  but he was provoked by Satan to number the people and it brought a curse down on the nation
[2:13:18.840 --> 2:13:23.680]  that's exactly what's going on here, we're being chipped, marked and numbered by this system
[2:13:23.680 --> 2:13:28.400]  Trump got buffaloed into it, of course he should have never had Alex Azar in IH
[2:13:28.400 --> 2:13:31.320]  he should have fired Fauci day one when he came into office
[2:13:31.320 --> 2:13:34.520]  alright, Trump is a King David archetype, he definitely is
[2:13:34.520 --> 2:13:40.600]  right, and you know what David did though, he repented immediately of it, Alex, he said this was my fault
[2:13:40.600 --> 2:13:44.120]  he said, look, kill me and my family but spare these sheep
[2:13:44.120 --> 2:13:47.560]  exactly, Trump must repent like the Santas did
[2:13:47.560 --> 2:13:53.280]  yes, absolutely, you were right on it with saying that and our listeners I think are paying attention to it too
[2:13:53.280 --> 2:13:59.440]  and I just really appreciate that, and if you get Dr. David Martin back on again, I think you've had him on before
[2:13:59.440 --> 2:14:04.600]  but he has got some outstanding stuff, he is talking about where they're going with all of this
[2:14:04.600 --> 2:14:10.040]  I'm trying to get Martin on, I had a family problem one day, blew up, went off the air, he thought it was personal
[2:14:10.040 --> 2:14:12.920]  he hasn't come on, but I really want to get him on
[2:14:12.920 --> 2:14:19.080]  yeah, we'll get him back on, but you know, he's saying that the monkeypox is actually going to be the effects of the vaccine
[2:14:19.080 --> 2:14:20.080]  when it's coming out the fall
[2:14:20.080 --> 2:14:27.000]  oh, absolutely, they admit the vaccine can cause monkeypox type reactions, plus we have these people raping dogs
[2:14:27.000 --> 2:14:30.520]  so now they're sick, I mean, it is insane, thank you so much, Steve
[2:14:30.520 --> 2:14:33.920]  Catherine and Michigan, got a minute and a half, go ahead Catherine
[2:14:33.920 --> 2:14:37.960]  Alex Jones, hi, it's a pleasure to speak with you, how are you?
[2:14:37.960 --> 2:14:39.840]  I'm okay, go ahead
[2:14:39.840 --> 2:14:47.480]  listen, I've been following you for about 15 years and that report from Savannah Hernandez was by far one of the most disturbing things I've ever heard in my life
[2:14:47.480 --> 2:14:55.000]  and I'm absolutely beside myself right now, I was listening while I was on hold, so thank you for airing that and I hope people share that report
[2:14:55.000 --> 2:14:57.440]  thank you for keeping us on air to expose it
[2:14:57.440 --> 2:15:07.160]  yes, yes sir, I wanted to call to talk about your book that's coming out the great reset and the war for the world and I want to talk about a couple of things that I did
[2:15:07.160 --> 2:15:17.360]  I never wanted to order the book from Amazon and I ordered it from them because, not because I like Amazon, but because I wanted your numbers to chart and keep charting
[2:15:17.360 --> 2:15:21.760]  right now I'm seeing Amazon charts number seven this week for your book
[2:15:21.760 --> 2:15:26.520]  the second thing that I did is I went to my local library
[2:15:26.520 --> 2:15:35.600]  I have a library card and often times people that have library cards can simply go online and submit a suggestion for a book to the library
[2:15:35.600 --> 2:15:44.920]  I actually went to the library and asked the librarian if I could please order or request an order of the copy of your book, The Great Reset
[2:15:44.920 --> 2:15:49.960]  she had me fill out a little flip of paper, she said she'd send it into the central library
[2:15:49.960 --> 2:15:55.960]  hold on, Katherine, don't hang up, I want to hear on the other side what happened when you did that, Katherine and Michigan, stay with us
[2:16:29.960 --> 2:16:40.960]  so it is a true 360 win-win situation when you go to infowarstore.com and get DNA Force Plus finally our flagship product back in stock

[2:17:56.960 --> 2:18:06.960]  the globalists are fighting around the clock to destroy the family to destroy heterosexual relationships to annihilate our marriages and the studies are all clear
[2:18:06.960 --> 2:18:16.960]  the number one cause of marital splits is that there's problems in the bedroom and the number one issue men have is erectile dysfunction
[2:18:16.960 --> 2:18:33.960]  ladies and gentlemen the left makes big jokes about this because they don't want people having lasting good love and relationships they want to break up society and we are so excited to have the number one natural male enhancement pill in the world available as a major sponsor now

[2:18:56.960 --> 2:19:10.960]  the great reset in the war for the world is the book that the government doesn't want you to read that most of the big powerful companies trying to control your life the big tech companies they don't want you to read this book
[2:19:10.960 --> 2:19:29.960]  I control what you think what you do what you read but you don't want that and Alex Jones doesn't want that and this book shows you what's happening and gives you the sort of playbook for how to fight against it and so by buying this book you're going to prove that censorship doesn't work that freedom is alive in this country
[2:19:29.960 --> 2:19:44.960]  this is a central reading and you know I would go right now and buy it before the censorship kicks in it's not going to be available in bookstores it's not going to be available in libraries they're going to try to take it down from every platform that they can but they're
[2:19:44.960 --> 2:19:57.960]  not going to be able to do it prove that censorship doesn't work by the great reset thank you Alex Jones I really appreciate you having me on and I appreciate you writing this book and getting the information out there
[2:19:57.960 --> 2:20:04.960]  leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order it's Alex Jones
[2:20:10.960 --> 2:20:20.960]  and we are back live on this Wednesday August 17th Worldwide broadcast I'm your host Alex Jones special guest joining us next segment I'm taking your calls right now
[2:20:20.960 --> 2:20:37.960]  Catherine in Michigan was bringing up trying to put our new book coming out next week the great reset in the world for the world in libraries and the response she got so finish your story I appreciate you calling Catherine
[2:20:37.960 --> 2:20:51.960]  Hi Alex Jones thanks for holding me over so I went to the library and went up to a librarian's desk and asked if there's a form that I could fill out to order the book and they didn't have any forms she handed me a little ripped up piece of paper like a piece of
[2:20:51.960 --> 2:21:08.960]  printer paper and said write the name of the book in the author and we'll send it to our central library headquarters or whatever it is and we'll request them to order the book for you so I turned into paper I thought I'll never see that paper again and lo and behold I
[2:21:08.960 --> 2:21:24.960]  checked the library's database and they obliged me they ordered one copy of the great reset and the war for the world and it's on order right now and being sent to the district library
[2:21:24.960 --> 2:21:39.960]  Well that's beautiful because librarians still believe in the First Amendment in most cases everybody should go to the library and ask them to order a copy of the great reset and the war for the world beautifully said yes thank you so much and that's the purpose of my call was to encourage people you
[2:21:39.960 --> 2:21:54.960]  can do it you can take a little bit of action it will cost you not one penny to go to your library and request that they order a copy of the great reset and much to my pleasant surprise and thrill they did it and so there's one copy in circulation
[2:21:54.960 --> 2:22:03.960]  Beautiful job Catherine everybody does it will change the world thank you let's talk to folks in Las Vegas, Nevada let's talk to Trent Trent you're on the air
[2:22:03.960 --> 2:22:22.960]  What's up Alex? Welcome sir. I was going over the things that Trump did while being president and campaigning like the campaign of Trump was completely different than the president Trump campaign promises were locked her up you know build a wall
[2:22:22.960 --> 2:22:39.960]  All these three word phrases but once he gets in he pardons the five megabanks for rampant fraud and corruption, city group, JP Morgan, Barclays, UBS and Deutsche Bank. Deutsche Bank he reported like $300 million to
[2:22:39.960 --> 2:22:55.960]  He openly talks about her sexual fantasies with Ivanka on like the Howard Stern show and Oprah or Good Morning America or whatever saying that if she wasn't his daughter he'd be married to her he has the Epstein connections he was introduced to Melania through
[2:22:55.960 --> 2:23:11.960]  Ghislaine Maxwell and Epstein Roy Cohn and Alan Dershowitz where his lawyers Alan Dershowitz is part of the Epstein thing Roy Cohn. So you don't think Trump's good so what do you think of what do you think of Governor DeSantis
[2:23:11.960 --> 2:23:33.960]  I don't trust any of them I think DeSantis might be better than Trump but I feel like people are just being funneled to DeSantis just like people were funneled to Trump I don't trust DeSantis I don't think any of them should be trusted I think all of them should be guilty until proven innocent just based off of the political climate
[2:23:33.960 --> 2:23:42.960]  I appreciate your call interesting points Trent thank you let's talk to Texas Patriot you're on the air thanks for holding and we'll go to Dave.
[2:23:42.960 --> 2:24:03.960]  So yeah I just wanted to say some information about what you and Savannah just talked about about all the trafficking of people coming she should really look into stuff going on and Del Rio of Laughlin Air Force Base because they are flying people out of there at night.
[2:24:03.960 --> 2:24:13.960]  It's incredible I mean mass child trafficking out of the open giving babies to people that don't know their names I mean this is just total criminal activity.
[2:24:13.960 --> 2:24:14.960]  Exactly.
[2:24:14.960 --> 2:24:23.960]  But yeah I just wanted to bring that up so you can look into that as well Texas Rangers are already on it they're watching planes coming out of there they've been watching planes coming out of there.
[2:24:23.960 --> 2:24:26.960]  Brother we've been down there for two years showing it it's incredible.
[2:24:26.960 --> 2:24:27.960]  All right.
[2:24:27.960 --> 2:24:30.960]  Where do you think this goes.
[2:24:30.960 --> 2:24:33.960]  I don't know where it goes.
[2:24:33.960 --> 2:24:39.960]  You can't you can't stop the federal government from you know committing their crimes.
[2:24:39.960 --> 2:24:42.960]  The federal government is going to 100% rub.
[2:24:42.960 --> 2:24:43.960]  Thank you Texas Patriot.
[2:24:43.960 --> 2:24:46.960]  David Chicago go ahead.
[2:24:46.960 --> 2:25:03.960]  Hey thanks Alex just wanted to say something here about I just watched your documentary with Aaron Russo where you interviewed him the other night and that was it was pretty compelling and really I mean I think everybody should take a look at that.
[2:25:03.960 --> 2:25:06.960]  Yeah that was 2000 2006.
[2:25:06.960 --> 2:25:07.960]  Yeah something like that.
[2:25:07.960 --> 2:25:08.960]  Yeah it was great.
[2:25:08.960 --> 2:25:09.960]  It was great.
[2:25:09.960 --> 2:25:24.960]  But hey what what made me call in is is you know everybody has on their mind you know what what kind of leader should we look to is it going to be Trump is it going to be dissent this is going to be this is going to be that you know leaders are temporary.
[2:25:24.960 --> 2:25:32.960]  You know he's he's it's principles not personalities I was taught that over 35 years ago.
[2:25:32.960 --> 2:25:35.960]  I agree it's what you stand for versus your rhetoric.
[2:25:35.960 --> 2:25:45.960]  Absolutely if we let those things be the guiding light those people that reflect the principles those people that espouse them and the principles I'm talking about.
[2:25:45.960 --> 2:25:50.960]  For our you know temporal government is the Constitution the Bill of Rights.
[2:25:50.960 --> 2:26:03.960]  I mean just think about every info warrior out there all of us listening this just think about if all of our leaders and representatives followed the Constitution and followed the Bill of Rights.
[2:26:03.960 --> 2:26:04.960]  End of story.
[2:26:04.960 --> 2:26:08.960]  We wouldn't be talking about exactly we got to get back to basics.
[2:26:08.960 --> 2:26:09.960]  Thank you Dave.
[2:26:09.960 --> 2:26:11.960]  And in Maryland you're on the air.
[2:26:11.960 --> 2:26:12.960]  Go ahead.
[2:26:12.960 --> 2:26:13.960]  Hey Alex.
[2:26:13.960 --> 2:26:16.960]  Thanks for having me on God bless you.
[2:26:16.960 --> 2:26:21.960]  I just saw Alex's war and I preordered the same book.
[2:26:21.960 --> 2:26:23.960]  And I can't wait to get that.
[2:26:23.960 --> 2:26:24.960]  Thank you.
[2:26:24.960 --> 2:26:35.960]  With the Trump with the Trump dissenters thing I'm thinking that I know Trump is flawed that's his and I don't think he's ever going to admit that he was wrong about the vaccine.
[2:26:35.960 --> 2:26:42.960]  But he he woke up a lot of people to even be read pills.
[2:26:42.960 --> 2:26:45.960]  So no I agree the enemy legitimately hates him.
[2:26:45.960 --> 2:26:49.960]  So there's a paradox like they really hate him like that's real.
[2:26:49.960 --> 2:26:50.960]  Yeah.
[2:26:50.960 --> 2:26:55.960]  And also while we're on Trump I ordered some.
[2:26:55.960 --> 2:27:00.960]  I just got my let's go brandy shirt from the info war store.

[2:33:23.960 --> 2:33:38.960]  SD plus Lieutenant American Special Forces to Purple Hearts, Stalingrad and Leningrad.
[2:33:38.960 --> 2:33:53.960]  Special Forces Texas Thunder Bob Howe's a real person.
[2:33:53.960 --> 2:34:06.960]  Let me tell you something. These folks have been a sponsor for years and they had the great satellite phones, but China broke down and all that happened and we haven't had this sponsored six months, but they've got something even better.
[2:34:06.960 --> 2:34:13.960]  So when you go to the website info wars off grid dot com, there's solar panels and the very best survival gear everything else.
[2:34:13.960 --> 2:34:22.960]  But what they really got is not just satellite phones back in stock, but something even better, something that takes any cell phone in my hand.
[2:34:22.960 --> 2:34:27.960]  And turns it into a sat phone that can't be tracked as 100% ready to go.
[2:34:27.960 --> 2:34:36.960]  It is very competitively priced probably one of the lowest cost out there and it supports broadcast so Robert how good to have you here with us.
[2:34:36.960 --> 2:34:45.960]  You're the CEO of Galileo and spokesman for the satellite phone store at Robert is a satellite and off-grid communications expert working in the preparedness community for over 10 years.
[2:34:45.960 --> 2:34:55.960]  He has his own podcast blazing press that airs on rumble and as a free speech activist Robert is a minister to an online church and the father of five children.
[2:34:55.960 --> 2:35:03.960]  And we are so excited to have him info wars off grid dot com info wars one word info wars off grid dot com.
[2:35:03.960 --> 2:35:06.960]  So Bob Howe good to have you here ladies and gentlemen.
[2:35:06.960 --> 2:35:11.960]  It's so good to have you tell us about this incredibly easy to use product.
[2:35:11.960 --> 2:35:22.960]  It's a great product Alex as you know you've probably been looking into it it's it's a it's a device that connects directly to your cell phone.
[2:35:22.960 --> 2:35:35.960]  Actually they have a package where you can get a cell phone and the baby together and you don't even have to have it connected to the Internet or to cellular service and it will Bluetooth directly to your baby device.
[2:35:35.960 --> 2:35:46.960]  They have it pre programmed if you get the package the full package which also includes Galileo service for you know monthly service which is a.
[2:35:46.960 --> 2:35:56.960]  It's a it's like a social media satellite network kind of set up on the side where you can talk to your or get your information from social media influencers like yourself.
[2:35:56.960 --> 2:36:07.960]  And what it does is basically they send you a cell a cell phone and a baby and it connects to satellite so this becomes your keypad.
[2:36:07.960 --> 2:36:21.960]  This you can send messages directly through the baby to a satellite now you can send messages directly through Internet or cellular data but if it's ever down it'll default to the satellite communicator.
[2:36:21.960 --> 2:36:30.960]  So any any kind of you know disaster or God forbid we get hacked like a solar wind hack you know how that how that went a while back.
[2:36:30.960 --> 2:36:38.960]  Canada was all out not too long ago I mean the whole grid seemed to be down on in Canada and people were freaking out because they couldn't even use their cell phones.
[2:36:38.960 --> 2:36:41.960]  This is a great way to keep in touch.
[2:36:41.960 --> 2:36:51.960]  You know we have disasters periodically in the country whether it's hurricanes or earthquakes but who knows what may be coming ahead with all the political turmoil.
[2:36:51.960 --> 2:36:58.960]  I'm kind of just bracing myself after I listen to a lot of your great commentary and giving heads up on things that are to come.
[2:36:58.960 --> 2:37:05.960]  And how you've been so accurate I'm just kind of hoping that you're you're not that accurate you know I'm saying Alex.
[2:37:05.960 --> 2:37:07.960]  Because you've been very accurate.
[2:37:07.960 --> 2:37:13.960]  I hear you what's exciting is you guys have satellite phones right now people want them for us off the grid dot com.
[2:37:13.960 --> 2:37:22.960]  But this system takes any system and makes it untraceable they don't know where you are and you can send messages this is the future.
[2:37:22.960 --> 2:37:33.960]  And what it is it's it's basically encrypted so it's short burst communication whereas a satellite data is more of a stream of data.
[2:37:33.960 --> 2:37:39.960]  This will actually alert five people that you designate if you need to let them know where you're at.
[2:37:39.960 --> 2:37:45.960]  Let's just say the grid goes down and you've got friends and family in different parts of the country or state wherever you live.
[2:37:45.960 --> 2:37:47.960]  You want them to know where you where you're at.
[2:37:47.960 --> 2:37:48.960]  Well and that's key.
[2:37:48.960 --> 2:37:50.960]  This is I would use the term above the grid.
[2:37:50.960 --> 2:37:52.960]  This is direct satellite.
[2:37:52.960 --> 2:37:58.960]  This is direct satellite directly to satellite and the most secure communication is bivvy to bivvy.
[2:37:58.960 --> 2:38:09.960]  Now if you're you can text directly from your Bluetooth to bivvy without any cellular service or Internet you can text to anybody that has a text.
[2:38:09.960 --> 2:38:15.960]  If they're on grid somewhere else in the world you could literally be out in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean.
[2:38:15.960 --> 2:38:17.960]  You could be in the Antarctic.
[2:38:17.960 --> 2:38:19.960]  You're going to get a signal wherever you're at.
[2:38:19.960 --> 2:38:21.960]  This is next level.
[2:38:21.960 --> 2:38:29.960]  And so you're communicating with people and letting them know if they need to let's say everything goes down and they need to get to where you're at.
[2:38:29.960 --> 2:38:33.960]  Well there's no gas and there's no electricity and so they get on a bicycle.
[2:38:33.960 --> 2:38:38.960]  They're going to be able to find you if you're hiding under a rock in some out out of the middle area woods.
[2:38:38.960 --> 2:38:41.960]  They're going to know exactly your location if you let them know.
[2:38:41.960 --> 2:38:45.960]  Now you don't have to let them know but this is only for people now they have.
[2:38:45.960 --> 2:38:56.960]  So it's also an emergency emergency location device so whether you're in the old fields of of Alaska or whether you're in Tajikistan whatever you need this.
[2:38:56.960 --> 2:38:57.960]  Yes.
[2:38:57.960 --> 2:39:06.960]  Now you can sign up for the service where they where you just press a panic button and the local first responders will get the message of where you're at.
[2:39:06.960 --> 2:39:10.960]  But you don't have to sign up and you can do this anonymously.

[2:40:41.960 --> 2:40:48.960]  And they're looking at this very seriously about sending this out to a global to their global network.
[2:40:48.960 --> 2:40:58.960]  And I'm not sure if you're familiar with in fact I was going to drop just so that you know who they are it was well let me see if I can remember the name there.

[2:41:20.960 --> 2:41:22.960]  But this little baby is the next level.
[2:41:22.960 --> 2:41:32.960]  Yeah well you know the cell phones because of the grid down and or the supply chain breakdown in China.
[2:41:32.960 --> 2:41:38.960]  You know having all a lot of the control of what we produce now all comes from China whether it's chips or well they come from Taiwan.
[2:41:38.960 --> 2:41:41.960]  But can you imagine if they take over Taiwan what's going to happen.
[2:41:41.960 --> 2:41:46.960]  I can tell you but but the supply is like 80% of the key chips are made there.
[2:41:46.960 --> 2:41:52.960]  Yeah every everything comes out of there and I mean everything would literally shut down if they took China or Taiwan over.
[2:41:52.960 --> 2:42:00.960]  And it's really frightening but when we saw what happened with that recent supply chain choke on the on the shipping.
[2:42:00.960 --> 2:42:07.960]  It affected everything food it affected everything and including components for your cars trucks tractor equipment.
[2:42:07.960 --> 2:42:11.960]  But the mother necessity is a mother of invention though.

[2:48:45.960 --> 2:49:00.960]  Now you know while supplies last you know if there's ever any major event that happens which I don't see is something that I do see something happening the way things are going.
[2:49:00.960 --> 2:49:15.960]  You know the way the news cycle is nowadays it's like something big is happening every day and and setting up for something much larger and if anything does happen on a large scale whatever it could be war in another country that affects us maybe we get involved.
[2:49:15.960 --> 2:49:17.960]  You're going to see these disappear.
[2:49:17.960 --> 2:49:21.960]  These are going to disappear just like the satellite phones did everybody's going to get them.
[2:49:21.960 --> 2:49:31.960]  The same thing happened with sat phones like I said these are these are not satellite phones but they are text messaging devices that are satellite and I think they're almost.
[2:49:31.960 --> 2:49:35.960]  Is as important of a tool as a satellite phone.
[2:49:35.960 --> 2:49:44.960]  Not to mention all the other devices people like like ham and and side but you know side bands or whatever but they these are great but they will disappear.
[2:49:44.960 --> 2:49:51.960]  If there is something that goes oh yeah side band and short waves great you know my uncle was like the world champion of that like age 10.
[2:49:51.960 --> 2:49:54.960]  That's all important how the government still communicates with the submarines.
[2:49:54.960 --> 2:49:58.960]  But the average person doesn't have ham radio operated webinar how to use it.
[2:49:58.960 --> 2:50:03.960]  This is something direct to sad that is reliable that everybody needs right now.
[2:50:03.960 --> 2:50:11.960]  Yeah and you know the government or the military uses their radium network the radium network is very is a very.
[2:50:11.960 --> 2:50:15.960]  There's only four networks in the whole world and there's two in the United States.
[2:50:15.960 --> 2:50:27.960]  A radium network is what the military uses and they came in and they bought up all the satellite phones without question because satellite phone store and they still have some in now.
[2:50:27.960 --> 2:50:37.960]  They just did get a new shipment but you know they're still very thin on the satellite phones but these we have some of but like I said your audience may buy them all up.
[2:50:37.960 --> 2:50:51.960]  So you know I encourage everybody to go get one now while there's still the time because whenever the big events happen and we told our audience because I do I do broadcast myself to a much smaller audience by the way but.
[2:50:51.960 --> 2:50:57.960]  No we've heard of you we've heard of you Bob Halk Texas Fort special thunder.
[2:50:57.960 --> 2:51:00.960]  Tell us about your show tell us about right now.
[2:51:00.960 --> 2:51:10.960]  Can I tell you a little story about yourself and this goes back you know back to Newtown why I've known about you ever since the beginning about 2010.
[2:51:10.960 --> 2:51:19.960]  People would say you know I was on YouTube doing my thing I started YouTube and people say you sound like Alex Jones and I was like who's Alex Jones you know I would just be out there talking about.
[2:51:19.960 --> 2:51:23.960]  I love that point it's not that we're listening to each other we know the truth.
[2:51:23.960 --> 2:51:36.960]  Exactly and I would be talking about scripture and Bible and how it relates to world events and people would say you know you sound like Alex Jones I kept hearing that and so I said OK who's this Alex Jones I went and checked him out I'm like OK.
[2:51:36.960 --> 2:51:46.960]  I was really the pieces were put together on some things that I didn't know that I was like wow this guy's right on the same wavelength I am they were right.
[2:51:46.960 --> 2:51:56.960]  Well back I got to tell you the story I've had an online fellowship church that I've had ever since 2010 and we've always met.
[2:51:56.960 --> 2:52:07.960]  You know in smaller groups on the side of my show and one day we said we felt really led to pray for you and this is an honest to God true story with my friends.
[2:52:07.960 --> 2:52:19.960]  Holy Spirit Holy Spirit I we felt led to pray for you and we prayed for you and I don't know what it was but I really believe it was a Holy Spirit that told us to pray for you.
[2:52:19.960 --> 2:52:28.960]  Within that week Newtown took place I'm not going to even go into the name because it's got such a stigma but you know what I'm talking about Newtown happened.
[2:52:28.960 --> 2:52:45.960]  What ended up happening is that week you played my video tell me this isn't amazing you played my video that I had shown the the the actual map where it said the word right there on the map of from the dark night rising.
[2:52:45.960 --> 2:52:51.960]  And it was all about isn't that weird why would that name be on the map of the dark night right.
[2:52:51.960 --> 2:53:02.960]  I've got to say it before they do it exactly and so what happened that week you prayed on the rate on the on the broadcast you talked about the Lord you talked about how this was a terrible event.
[2:53:02.960 --> 2:53:15.960]  I even think you you wept on the rate on the on that broadcast and then mentioned our name and I said look at that guys we prayed for him and look at what happened and then guess what then I'm supposed to be on your show on Friday the day that you got sued.
[2:53:15.960 --> 2:53:20.960]  Tell me that's not divine orchestration.
[2:53:20.960 --> 2:53:22.960]  No God's real God's 100% real.
[2:53:22.960 --> 2:53:32.960]  You had to put me off because you were in court that day but I'll tell you what I always thought and I always wanted to contact you about that and tell you I always try I tried twice.
[2:53:32.960 --> 2:53:46.960]  You know that was you know before I could get through but I really felt that that was from God and that God was going to protect you going into the future whatever was going to come and it ended up being that was what they went after so.
[2:53:46.960 --> 2:53:53.960]  They want to use it against the first amendment and the second amendment so people say how are you taking it.
[2:53:53.960 --> 2:53:56.960]  We have thousands of children dying away from these shots.
[2:53:56.960 --> 2:53:58.960]  We have pure evil happening.
[2:53:58.960 --> 2:54:02.960]  What's happening to us as adults is nothing compared to the children.
[2:54:02.960 --> 2:54:07.960]  This is all part of God's plan we just got to be steadfast and truthful and God will win the end.
[2:54:07.960 --> 2:54:14.960]  And I gotta say something about you to Alex I see you out there doing the work not just talking about it.
[2:54:14.960 --> 2:54:19.960]  You know I have to bring up Isaiah 58 this is the way I see what you're doing.
[2:54:19.960 --> 2:54:31.960]  It says it talks about how you know the religious elites out there and I'm going to liken it in a way to your political stance because I think it's not just political.
[2:54:31.960 --> 2:54:34.960]  I think what you have is a heart for what is true.
[2:54:34.960 --> 2:54:36.960]  You know it truly is an infill war.
[2:54:36.960 --> 2:54:39.960]  You know in the beginning was the word.
[2:54:39.960 --> 2:54:40.960]  It was a message.
[2:54:40.960 --> 2:54:41.960]  It was a concept.
[2:54:41.960 --> 2:54:42.960]  It was an idea.
[2:54:42.960 --> 2:54:49.960]  It was what was true and there's also a false truth a false light and that's the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.
[2:54:49.960 --> 2:54:55.960]  Well you're wanting to get that message out to the people and there's a battle and it's a spiritual battle.
[2:54:55.960 --> 2:54:56.960]  It's not just a political battle.
[2:54:56.960 --> 2:55:04.960]  It's a kingdom not of this world but it the kingdoms of the world are threatened by it right because it isn't it is within the heart.
[2:55:04.960 --> 2:55:11.960]  So one of the things that I saw today when I was thinking about this I was thinking you know Alex is out there on the front lines just like with these kids.
[2:55:11.960 --> 2:55:19.960]  Out there on the border you're calling attention to what's happening just like your previous guest really great guest you had on there was amazing.
[2:55:19.960 --> 2:55:31.960]  But it talks about the elites that say they're fasting there say they're doing religious service to God they they have all these trappings of religiosity but they don't really do what they preach.
[2:55:31.960 --> 2:55:38.960]  And who was the Samaritan was the one that did instead of what the religious people did walking past the guy that was dying.
[2:55:38.960 --> 2:55:45.960]  The Samaritan went and picked up the guy that was on the side of the road and they helped him and Jesus said who was really doing the love of God.
[2:55:45.960 --> 2:55:48.960]  It wasn't the religious people that were trying to be holy.
[2:55:48.960 --> 2:55:49.960]  It was the guy who helped.
[2:55:49.960 --> 2:55:57.960]  So I want to read you this one passage that I really thought encapsulates the heart of what you're doing here at Info Wars.
[2:55:57.960 --> 2:56:11.960]  Is this not the kind of fasting that I have chosen to lose the chains of injustice to untie the cords of the yoke to set the oppressed free and to break every yoke of bondage.
[2:56:11.960 --> 2:56:21.960]  Is it not to share your food with the hungry to provide the poor wander with shelter when you see the naked to clothe them and not to turn away from your own flesh and blood.
[2:56:21.960 --> 2:56:27.960]  Then your light will break forth like the dawn and your healing will quickly appear.
[2:56:27.960 --> 2:56:33.960]  Then your righteousness will go out before you and the glory of your of the Lord will be your rear guard.
[2:56:33.960 --> 2:56:36.960]  Then you will call upon the Lord and he will answer you.
[2:56:36.960 --> 2:56:39.960]  You will cry for help and he will say here I am.
[2:56:39.960 --> 2:56:48.960]  If you do away with the yoke of oppression with the point of the finger and malicious talk and if you spend yourselves on behalf of the hungry and satisfy the needs of the oppressed.
[2:56:48.960 --> 2:56:53.960]  Then your light will rise in the darkness and the light and your night will become like noon day.
[2:56:53.960 --> 2:56:59.960]  The Lord will guide you always and he will satisfy your needs in a sun scorched land and he will strengthen your frame.
[2:56:59.960 --> 2:57:01.960]  And that's what we're praying for you Alex.

[2:59:59.960 --> 3:00:01.960]  S. B. Flisken.
[3:00:01.960 --> 3:00:05.960]  American Lieutenant Special Forces Unit Black Blight.
[3:00:05.960 --> 3:00:08.960]  Two Purple Hearts, Leningrad and Siberia.
[3:00:08.960 --> 3:00:11.960]  Youngest man to be decorated by the President.
[3:00:11.960 --> 3:00:17.960]  You rob the Federal Reserve Depository, Life Sentence, New York Maximum Security Penitentiary.
[3:00:17.960 --> 3:00:21.960]  I'm ready to kick your ass out of the world, war hero.
[3:00:35.960 --> 3:00:36.960]  Who are you?
[3:00:36.960 --> 3:00:37.960]  How?
[3:00:37.960 --> 3:00:39.960]  Police Commissioner.
[3:00:39.960 --> 3:00:41.960]  Bob Hawk.
[3:00:41.960 --> 3:00:44.960]  Special Forces Unit Texas Thunder.
[3:00:44.960 --> 3:00:46.960]  We heard of you too, Flisken.
[3:00:46.960 --> 3:00:48.960]  Why are we talking?
[3:00:48.960 --> 3:00:50.960]  I have a deal for you.
[3:00:50.960 --> 3:00:55.960]  You receive full pardon for every criminal action you've committed in the United States.
[3:00:55.960 --> 3:00:57.960]  It was an accident.
[3:00:57.960 --> 3:01:00.960]  About an hour ago, a small jet went down inside New York City.
[3:01:00.960 --> 3:01:03.960]  The President was on board.
[3:01:03.960 --> 3:01:05.960]  President of what?
[3:01:05.960 --> 3:01:07.960]  That's not funny, Flisken.
[3:01:07.960 --> 3:01:12.960]  You go in, find the President, bring him out in 24 hours, and you're a free man.
[3:01:12.960 --> 3:01:14.960]  24 hours, huh?
[3:01:14.960 --> 3:01:15.960]  I'm making you an offer.
[3:01:15.960 --> 3:01:16.960]  Bullshit.
[3:01:16.960 --> 3:01:17.960]  Straight, just like I said.
[3:01:17.960 --> 3:01:18.960]  I'll think about it.
[3:01:18.960 --> 3:01:20.960]  No time. Give me an answer.
[3:01:20.960 --> 3:01:22.960]  Get a new President.
[3:01:22.960 --> 3:01:25.960]  We're still at war, Flisken. We need him alive.
[3:01:25.960 --> 3:01:30.960]  I don't give a fuck about your war, or your President.
[3:01:30.960 --> 3:01:32.960]  Is that your answer?
[3:01:32.960 --> 3:01:33.960]  I'm thinking about it.
[3:01:33.960 --> 3:01:48.960]  I think hard.
[3:01:48.960 --> 3:01:50.960]  All right, Bob Huck.
[3:01:50.960 --> 3:01:53.960]  Signs us now from M4sOffGrid.com
[3:01:53.960 --> 3:01:58.960]  with an incredible product at FunCM4 that everybody should have now
[3:01:58.960 --> 3:02:05.960]  and get initiated into off-grid satellite communications.
[3:02:05.960 --> 3:02:11.960]  Give us a two-minute pitch on why we should go to off-grid right now in 4soffgrid.com.
[3:02:11.960 --> 3:02:16.960]  Well, you can get yourself connected in case there's ever a major disaster,
[3:02:16.960 --> 3:02:23.960]  and we know that they've been telegraphing in the news about potential nuclear events
[3:02:23.960 --> 3:02:26.960]  in connection with the Trump raid.
[3:02:26.960 --> 3:02:29.960]  You never know what they're thinking or what they're going to do.
[3:02:29.960 --> 3:02:35.960]  If it is a global war that breaks out, or there's such a huge potential,
[3:02:35.960 --> 3:02:41.960]  you want to have the ability to connect to your loved ones in case of a grid down.
[3:02:41.960 --> 3:02:45.960]  Now, the solar wind hack back a few years ago was a very big hack,
[3:02:45.960 --> 3:02:50.960]  and they said that that could set a precedence for things to come.
[3:02:50.960 --> 3:02:56.960]  And if they could shut down government infrastructure, critical infrastructure,
[3:02:56.960 --> 3:03:05.960]  you're talking about potentially lights, electricity, energy, gas, diesel, food.
[3:03:05.960 --> 3:03:11.960]  We've got so many crises unfolding right now, why wouldn't you want to have an extra backup?
[3:03:11.960 --> 3:03:18.960]  And this is a very cheap solution monthly to be able to have that little bit of insurance.
[3:03:18.960 --> 3:03:21.960]  And they say this is personal insurance to keep you in touch with loved ones
[3:03:21.960 --> 3:03:25.960]  that might not be in your local vicinity.
[3:03:25.960 --> 3:03:27.960]  And that way, you always have the ability.
[3:03:27.960 --> 3:03:31.960]  Unless, of course, they decide to destroy all satellites,
[3:03:31.960 --> 3:03:35.960]  you're going to have the ability to communicate to loved ones.
[3:03:35.960 --> 3:03:41.960]  And I think that's the most important thing, is keeping touch, keeping communications open.
[3:03:41.960 --> 3:03:43.960]  Well, that's a good point you make.
[3:03:43.960 --> 3:03:46.960]  I mean, New York a month ago ran nuclear war drills saying,
[3:03:46.960 --> 3:03:49.960]  if you're under local radio, that won't be on the air,
[3:03:49.960 --> 3:03:51.960]  but satellites will be during a nuclear war.
[3:03:51.960 --> 3:03:52.960]  It's just that simple.
[3:03:52.960 --> 3:03:57.960]  One of the basic things people need is this sat phone connector to any cell phone.
[3:03:57.960 --> 3:04:01.960]  Everybody should go to infowordsoffgrid.com and get it right now.
[3:04:01.960 --> 3:04:03.960]  Yes, they should.
[3:04:03.960 --> 3:04:05.960]  And you know, you're supporting the Info War.
[3:04:05.960 --> 3:04:08.960]  I'm going to get myself some of that DNA force.
[3:04:08.960 --> 3:04:13.960]  I tell you, if they're messing with the genome and the DNA and they're trying to edit it,
[3:04:13.960 --> 3:04:18.960]  I'm going to get some of that DNA force to make sure that everything is perfect in my body.
[3:04:18.960 --> 3:04:20.960]  There's no doubt it counters that.
[3:04:20.960 --> 3:04:21.960]  All right, Bob Howe.
[3:04:21.960 --> 3:04:22.960]  Thank you so much for the time.
[3:04:22.960 --> 3:04:23.960]  I look forward to speaking to you again.
[3:04:23.960 --> 3:04:25.960]  And come on as a guest and talk about your ministry and what you're doing.
[3:04:25.960 --> 3:04:26.960]  Rather, we love you.
[3:04:26.960 --> 3:04:27.960]  Okay.
[3:04:27.960 --> 3:04:28.960]  Thank you very much, Alex.
[3:04:28.960 --> 3:04:29.960]  Love you too.
[3:04:29.960 --> 3:04:30.960]  We got a lot of people praying for you.
[3:04:30.960 --> 3:04:31.960]  I need it.
[3:04:31.960 --> 3:04:32.960]  All right.
[3:04:32.960 --> 3:04:37.960]  Kate Dowley is about to take over an Owen Schreuer in 55 minutes with the war room,
[3:04:37.960 --> 3:04:42.960]  3 to 6 p.m. central info wars.com forward slash show and band out video.
[3:04:42.960 --> 3:04:44.960]  And we got a great audience of amazing activists.
[3:04:44.960 --> 3:04:48.960]  But when you get activated, when you spread the articles, when you spread the links,
[3:04:48.960 --> 3:04:49.960]  it's unstoppable.
[3:04:49.960 --> 3:04:51.960]  So please realize your tip of spear.
[3:04:51.960 --> 3:05:20.960]  They're right back with Kate Dowley.
[3:06:01.960 --> 3:06:03.960]  Hi, welcome back to the Alex Jones show.
[3:06:03.960 --> 3:06:06.960]  I'm Kate Dowley, your host for the hour.
[3:06:06.960 --> 3:06:09.960]  And from the Kate Dowley show, KateDowleyRadio.com.
[3:06:09.960 --> 3:06:17.960]  I am marked safe today from criticizing, just merely criticizing the FBI raids as I was warned.
[3:06:17.960 --> 3:06:20.960]  Liz Cheney's delusional speeches.
[3:06:20.960 --> 3:06:23.960]  Non-blinking, non-blinking psychotic anger.
[3:06:23.960 --> 3:06:28.960]  And the IRS agent SWAT teams that are moving in for the kill.
[3:06:28.960 --> 3:06:29.960]  I feel safe.
[3:06:29.960 --> 3:06:34.960]  I'm not safe from chemtrails, but totally safe from those four things for the next 24 hours,
[3:06:34.960 --> 3:06:35.960]  I hope.
[3:06:35.960 --> 3:06:42.960]  Also, this just in, I just wanted to say, this is a true headline from Daily Tech News.
[3:06:42.960 --> 3:06:49.960]  Wind-powered cargo ships are about to change history as they move goods through the ocean now.
[3:06:49.960 --> 3:06:56.960]  A possible launch of these wind-powered ships is due to make their official breakthrough in 2024.
[3:06:56.960 --> 3:06:58.960]  This was breaking news.
[3:06:58.960 --> 3:07:00.960]  Wind-powered ships.
[3:07:00.960 --> 3:07:06.960]  What a time to be alive in 2022.
[3:07:06.960 --> 3:07:08.960]  Not all they need is a band of pirates.
[3:07:08.960 --> 3:07:11.960]  I know where they can get a slew of them.
[3:07:11.960 --> 3:07:13.960]  How about Washington for starters?
[3:07:13.960 --> 3:07:18.960]  And how about every nook and cranny city and county in the country that's being taken over?
[3:07:18.960 --> 3:07:23.960]  So, I was up at seven this morning, and I do research well into the night every night,
[3:07:23.960 --> 3:07:25.960]  and I usually do four or five hours a day.
[3:07:25.960 --> 3:07:28.960]  That's no joke for ten years, okay?
[3:07:28.960 --> 3:07:32.960]  And I was already tired of the left-right paradigm headlines.
[3:07:32.960 --> 3:07:33.960]  I just hate it.
[3:07:33.960 --> 3:07:34.960]  It's just getting old.
[3:07:34.960 --> 3:07:39.960]  I wonder if they're getting tired of putting forth these narratives because I'm getting tired of reading them.
[3:07:39.960 --> 3:07:43.960]  But of course, Liz was fired every so often.
[3:07:43.960 --> 3:07:50.960]  They seem to sacrifice one of their little sacrificial lambs, those doing their bidding, you know,
[3:07:50.960 --> 3:07:56.960]  to Satan and then give Dominion software arrest.
[3:07:56.960 --> 3:08:05.960]  So, especially after we realized that we have 180,000 IRS agents plus to take your assets,
[3:08:05.960 --> 3:08:07.960]  they don't want your money.
[3:08:07.960 --> 3:08:08.960]  They can print money.
[3:08:08.960 --> 3:08:09.960]  They can print money.
[3:08:09.960 --> 3:08:13.960]  They can print all the money they wish to like they've been doing for decades.
[3:08:13.960 --> 3:08:16.960]  But they want your assets, and they want your kids.
[3:08:16.960 --> 3:08:18.960]  You thought I was going to say asses, didn't you?
[3:08:18.960 --> 3:08:19.960]  They want your asses.
[3:08:19.960 --> 3:08:22.960]  They want your assets, and they want your kids.
[3:08:22.960 --> 3:08:23.960]  That's what they want.
[3:08:23.960 --> 3:08:24.960]  That's what they're after.
[3:08:24.960 --> 3:08:25.960]  And it is.
[3:08:25.960 --> 3:08:26.960]  It's terrifying.
[3:08:26.960 --> 3:08:32.960]  But today, I want to bring you some working research in this hour because I feel like I can bring you some facts,
[3:08:32.960 --> 3:08:35.960]  and then you can decide if it's some sort of conspiracy theory.
[3:08:35.960 --> 3:08:38.960]  I bet that just made the FBI so happy.
[3:08:38.960 --> 3:08:40.960]  The FBI is so happy for me to say that.
[3:08:40.960 --> 3:08:45.960]  But spoiler alert, this is a conspiracy of several people.
[3:08:45.960 --> 3:08:48.960]  So I'll go over the facts, and then you get to decide, okay?
[3:08:48.960 --> 3:08:50.960]  But this is a big deal.
[3:08:50.960 --> 3:08:58.960]  What I'm about to talk about, because it turns COVID-19 and it turns the entire narrative of the medical cabal on its head.
[3:08:58.960 --> 3:09:00.960]  So you decide.
[3:09:00.960 --> 3:09:07.960]  I know that whenever I hear the word toxicology, my brain kind of shuts off because of the last two and a half years
[3:09:07.960 --> 3:09:11.960]  having to deal with all these horrendous lies and headlines.
[3:09:11.960 --> 3:09:12.960]  And yours might, too.
[3:09:12.960 --> 3:09:15.960]  But don't let it because you're going to want to hear this, okay?
[3:09:15.960 --> 3:09:19.960]  And it's going to come from my research I've done over the last two years on this subject,
[3:09:19.960 --> 3:09:24.960]  and then also William Engdahl did a great piece at williamengdahl.com, a toxicology piece.
[3:09:24.960 --> 3:09:26.960]  And so that's why I say the word toxicology.
[3:09:26.960 --> 3:09:31.960]  But you're not going to be able to forget what I'm about to spell out because it's that vital.
[3:09:31.960 --> 3:09:34.960]  So we had, I'm going to take you back a hundred years.
[3:09:34.960 --> 3:09:41.960]  We had several outbreaks of really unique symptoms back in 1907, 1915, and 16.
[3:09:41.960 --> 3:09:46.960]  Outbreak of sickness in New York City and New Jersey kind of were where the hubs were.
[3:09:46.960 --> 3:09:48.960]  So keep that in mind.
[3:09:48.960 --> 3:09:52.960]  The director of the Rockefeller Institute, his name was Simon Flexner.
[3:09:52.960 --> 3:09:53.960]  MD.
[3:09:53.960 --> 3:09:54.960]  Simon Flexner.
[3:09:54.960 --> 3:09:56.960]  Remember that name.
[3:09:56.960 --> 3:09:58.960]  It's kind of like a Dick Cheney.
[3:09:58.960 --> 3:10:01.960]  Honey, whenever I see Dick Cheney, I always think 9-11.
[3:10:01.960 --> 3:10:02.960]  Why is that?
[3:10:02.960 --> 3:10:05.960]  Anyway, Dick Cheney.
[3:10:05.960 --> 3:10:08.960]  So that's kind of a Dick Cheney guy, Simon Flexner.
[3:10:08.960 --> 3:10:17.960]  And this was a huge opportunity to come up with a new discovery, a brand new discovery that the world had never known,
[3:10:17.960 --> 3:10:19.960]  and he was about to deliver it to you.
[3:10:19.960 --> 3:10:22.960]  There he is, director of Rockefeller Institute.
[3:10:22.960 --> 3:10:31.960]  And what his discovery was, was he and Paul Lewis, was this invisible thing that they invisible to the naked eye,
[3:10:31.960 --> 3:10:33.960]  and they wanted to call a virus.
[3:10:33.960 --> 3:10:35.960]  They named it a virus.
[3:10:35.960 --> 3:10:41.960]  And they said that it was caused, all these couple of outbreaks that were just kind of strange,
[3:10:41.960 --> 3:10:44.960]  with strange symptoms, called it poliomyelitis.
[3:10:44.960 --> 3:10:47.960]  Poliomyelitis, I'm sorry, poliomyelitis.
[3:10:47.960 --> 3:10:49.960]  I'm like the name murderer or so, you know that.
[3:10:49.960 --> 3:10:51.960]  Anyway, poliomyelitis.
[3:10:51.960 --> 3:10:58.960]  So the word poliomyelitis simply means this, inflammation of the spinal cords, gray matter.
[3:10:58.960 --> 3:11:06.960]  And there were about 2,500 or more New Yorkers, mostly kids, and they had this form of poliomyelitis,
[3:11:06.960 --> 3:11:10.960]  including paralysis and even death, not all of them, but some of them.
[3:11:10.960 --> 3:11:17.960]  And orthopedic surgeons at the time began to kind of find this number of paralyzed children all of the sudden.
[3:11:17.960 --> 3:11:19.960]  They couldn't figure out why.
[3:11:19.960 --> 3:11:29.960]  So from 1900 to 1950, 1950s, every key phase of the business was controlled by people that were tied to the Rockefeller Medical Cabal.
[3:11:29.960 --> 3:11:32.960]  And I'll explain this, I'll explain how they did this.
[3:11:32.960 --> 3:11:37.960]  The fraud started with claims by the director of the Rockefeller Institute, Simon Flexner,
[3:11:37.960 --> 3:11:41.960]  that he and Paul Lewis, his colleague, had isolated a pathogen.
[3:11:41.960 --> 3:11:43.960]  This is where it's important to realize this.
[3:11:43.960 --> 3:11:49.960]  They isolated this pathogen, invisible, even smaller than bacteria, they said,
[3:11:49.960 --> 3:11:55.960]  which they claimed was causing paralysis, sickness, in the series of these outbreaks.
[3:11:55.960 --> 3:12:01.960]  And the reason I'm talking about this today is because whenever you talk about vaccines or medicine,
[3:12:01.960 --> 3:12:06.960]  and we're going to be talking more about vaccines, because I know they have a whole bushel more to sell you, to push you into,
[3:12:06.960 --> 3:12:10.960]  is that everybody plays the polio trump card.
[3:12:10.960 --> 3:12:12.960]  So we're about to blow that out of the water.
[3:12:12.960 --> 3:12:21.960]  So how did they isolate this new invisible thing that they were declaring to the world, the Rockefeller Institute, as a new discovery?
[3:12:21.960 --> 3:12:23.960]  How did they do that?
[3:12:23.960 --> 3:12:25.960]  Well, here's the facts.
[3:12:25.960 --> 3:12:32.960]  In a paper published in 1909, in the Journal of the American Medical Association, the AMA,
[3:12:32.960 --> 3:12:37.960]  Simon Flexner claimed that he and Lewis had isolated poliomyelitis,
[3:12:37.960 --> 3:12:42.960]  this virus that was responsible, and they reported that they successfully
[3:12:42.960 --> 3:12:50.960]  passages, quote, passages poliomyelitis through several monkeys, from monkey to monkey.
[3:12:50.960 --> 3:12:53.960]  Now, I know you're asking yourself, why did they have to do that?
[3:12:53.960 --> 3:12:55.960]  It's a good question.
[3:12:55.960 --> 3:13:03.960]  They began by injecting diseased human spinal cord tissue of a young boy who had died,
[3:13:03.960 --> 3:13:09.960]  presumably from this invisible virus that they claimed to be a virus,
[3:13:09.960 --> 3:13:16.960]  and they took this spinal cord, this diseased spinal cord tissue, and they put it into the brains of monkeys.
[3:13:16.960 --> 3:13:18.960]  Seriously?
[3:13:18.960 --> 3:13:21.960]  Yeah, they put it into the brains of monkeys.
[3:13:21.960 --> 3:13:30.960]  And after the monkey fell ill, a suspension of its diseased spinal cord tissue was injected into the brains of other monkeys,
[3:13:30.960 --> 3:13:32.960]  and they fell ill.
[3:13:32.960 --> 3:13:38.960]  They proclaimed that the Rockefeller Institute doctors had proven poliomyelitis,
[3:13:38.960 --> 3:13:43.960]  virus causality, for the mystery disease.
[3:13:43.960 --> 3:13:51.960]  Why did they have to inject the brains of monkeys with diseased spinal cord to discover a virus?
[3:13:51.960 --> 3:13:53.960]  Why did they have to take that stuff?
[3:13:53.960 --> 3:13:55.960]  Seems odd, doesn't it?
[3:13:55.960 --> 3:13:57.960]  If you have a bacteria, something's wrong with you.
[3:13:57.960 --> 3:14:00.960]  It's really easy to go, well, there's a bacteria.
[3:14:00.960 --> 3:14:02.960]  We can see that under the microscope.
[3:14:02.960 --> 3:14:05.960]  This is something that is affecting you, right?
[3:14:05.960 --> 3:14:10.960]  And many of the things that we incurred, like black plague and all these things, were bacterias.
[3:14:10.960 --> 3:14:15.960]  And we also had poor sanitation, and that's how things spread, okay?
[3:14:15.960 --> 3:14:20.960]  So why did they have to inject this into the brains of monkeys?
[3:14:20.960 --> 3:14:26.960]  Why couldn't they just take the sample of spinal cord tissue and tell you what was in it?
[3:14:26.960 --> 3:14:28.960]  Why couldn't they do that?
[3:14:28.960 --> 3:14:30.960]  This is where it gets so interesting.
[3:14:30.960 --> 3:14:35.960]  Wouldn't a virus, if it was an actual thing, be able to just be identified on its own?
[3:14:35.960 --> 3:14:36.960]  You'd be surprised.
[3:14:36.960 --> 3:14:43.960]  When I had Judy Mike of its own, I asked her if virus had to be taken from somebody, a swab, like snot, whatever it is.
[3:14:43.960 --> 3:14:49.960]  And it had to be processed or passaged through five different things, kidney cells,
[3:14:49.960 --> 3:14:54.960]  which are really easily like diseased monkey kidney cells, and all these different things,
[3:14:54.960 --> 3:14:57.960]  then to show you what virus you have.
[3:14:57.960 --> 3:14:59.960]  Did you know that?
[3:14:59.960 --> 3:15:06.960]  The sample has to be drug through disease in order to tell you that you're sick.
[3:15:06.960 --> 3:15:11.960]  Ooh, that's a really big tell on what I'm about to tell you as well.
[3:15:11.960 --> 3:15:19.960]  So, Flexner and Lewis admitted that we failed utterly to discover bacteria as a cause,
[3:15:19.960 --> 3:15:23.960]  either in film preparations or in cultures that could account for the disease.
[3:15:23.960 --> 3:15:29.960]  And since among our long series of propagations of this virus, no one showed in the lesions,
[3:15:29.960 --> 3:15:31.960]  they basically said this.
[3:15:31.960 --> 3:15:36.960]  We decided that it was going to be this new discovery called a virus,
[3:15:36.960 --> 3:15:42.960]  because we couldn't find a bacteria, not because they proved it was ever a virus.
[3:15:42.960 --> 3:15:44.960]  They never proved it.
[3:15:44.960 --> 3:15:45.960]  Ever.
[3:15:45.960 --> 3:15:47.960]  A virus was a made-up word.
[3:15:47.960 --> 3:15:49.960]  They just couldn't prove it was a bacteria.
[3:15:49.960 --> 3:15:51.960]  So they came to an assumption.
[3:15:51.960 --> 3:15:53.960]  You have to stay tuned for the rest of this.
[3:15:53.960 --> 3:15:54.960]  I'll be right back.
[3:15:54.960 --> 3:15:55.960]  I'm Kate Daly, your guest.
[3:15:55.960 --> 3:16:00.960]  Several years ago, I approached one of the top companies in the U.S.
[3:16:00.960 --> 3:16:04.960]  that supplies the highest quality signature-reducing Faraday cages,
[3:16:04.960 --> 3:16:07.960]  the Pentagon, and other U.S. government agencies.
[3:16:07.960 --> 3:16:12.960]  And now they have produced specifically for us this made-in-America onion line
[3:16:12.960 --> 3:16:14.960]  at a very affordable price,
[3:16:14.960 --> 3:16:17.960]  whether it's small pouches that protect your cell phone,
[3:16:17.960 --> 3:16:21.960]  or big pouches that protect laptops and iPads,
[3:16:21.960 --> 3:16:24.960]  or big bags that promote whatever electronics you want to put in it,
[3:16:24.960 --> 3:16:26.960]  like desktop computers.
[3:16:26.960 --> 3:16:32.960]  It is all exclusively available at InfoWarsTour.com under the Redux name.
[3:16:32.960 --> 3:16:35.960]  Redux is InfoWars, taking the highest quality products
[3:16:35.960 --> 3:16:39.960]  and bringing them directly to you at InfoWarsTour.com.
[3:16:39.960 --> 3:16:43.960]  In this insane world, you are crazy if you don't protect your signature,
[3:16:43.960 --> 3:16:48.960]  your identity from identity theft, hackers, criminals, corporations, governments.
[3:16:48.960 --> 3:17:16.960]  This is one of the hottest items out there today that's exclusively available at InfoWarsTour.com.
[3:17:28.960 --> 3:17:34.960]  So it is a true 360 win-win situation when you go to InfoWarsTour.com
[3:17:34.960 --> 3:17:39.960]  and get DNA Force Plus, finally, our flagship product back in stock.
[3:17:39.960 --> 3:17:42.960]  It keeps us on the air, and it's going to sell out quick.
[3:17:42.960 --> 3:17:50.960]  But despite that, we're offering it for 50% off at InfoWarsTour.com
[3:17:50.960 --> 3:17:55.960]  to support our longtime viewers and listeners and for new folks to take advantage of it.
[3:17:55.960 --> 3:17:58.960]  People say Alex Jones is crazy. He's a conspiracy theory guy.
[3:17:58.960 --> 3:18:01.960]  He's a nutcase. He's got these rants and all that.
[3:18:01.960 --> 3:18:09.960]  What they miss is that this guy's ahead of the curve on so many different topics of signal, not noise.
[3:18:09.960 --> 3:18:15.960]  If you look at the signal, and you compare that to PBS and NPR and BBC
[3:18:15.960 --> 3:18:21.960]  and we'll do what Alex Jones put out there versus what your collective body has put out there.
[3:18:21.960 --> 3:18:25.960]  And if you're a human being and just watching it, you say, well, Alex Jones is ahead of this.
[3:18:25.960 --> 3:18:27.960]  Not only that, he kind of explained it.
[3:18:27.960 --> 3:18:30.960]  You are one of the great thinkers of this.
[3:18:30.960 --> 3:18:35.960]  That is very rare. You've got to go back almost to the revolutionary generation and see that.
[3:18:35.960 --> 3:18:38.960]  In this new book, I've got to tell you, when Tony Lyons first approached me,
[3:18:38.960 --> 3:18:42.960]  I read this thing. I go, this is it. This is no beetry.
[3:18:42.960 --> 3:18:44.960]  You're not going to be flipping pages here. You're going to be having a pin out.
[3:18:44.960 --> 3:18:46.960]  You're going to be underlining stuff.
[3:18:46.960 --> 3:18:49.960]  The Great Reset by Alex Jones.
[3:18:49.960 --> 3:18:54.960]  Order your copy now at Amazon or InfowarsTour.com.
[3:18:54.960 --> 3:19:00.960]  We are now living in the void, sliding towards collapse in the strange space
[3:19:00.960 --> 3:19:03.960]  between what we've known and what's to come.
[3:19:03.960 --> 3:19:08.960]  And right now, the most important thing to remember is don't panic.
[3:19:08.960 --> 3:19:12.960]  Stay calm because now is the time that we must get our bearings
[3:19:12.960 --> 3:19:16.960]  and steer the ship onto a safe sound course.
[3:19:16.960 --> 3:19:20.960]  There is nothing stopping we, the people, from making our own rules
[3:19:20.960 --> 3:19:23.960]  and building our own society.
[3:19:23.960 --> 3:19:25.960]  All we got to do is survive the crash.
[3:19:25.960 --> 3:19:28.960]  And right now, we still have time to prepare.
[3:19:28.960 --> 3:19:32.960]  The world fiat currency system is racing towards zero.
[3:19:32.960 --> 3:19:39.960]  It's time to convert it into hard assets now, including food, water, and survival gear
[3:19:39.960 --> 3:19:41.960]  to keep us strong and at the ready.
[3:19:41.960 --> 3:19:45.960]  Go to preparedtoday.com for the essentials,

[3:20:10.960 --> 3:20:12.960]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[3:20:12.960 --> 3:20:15.960]  So glad you're listening today. I'm Kate Daly, your guest host.
[3:20:15.960 --> 3:20:18.960]  Glad to be here from KateDalyRadio.com and the Kate Daly Show.
[3:20:18.960 --> 3:20:21.960]  Well, I'm also marked safe from monkeypox.
[3:20:21.960 --> 3:20:24.960]  I forgot that one because I'm a heterosexual female.
[3:20:24.960 --> 3:20:28.960]  Yeah. Anyway, they're trying to sell that hard.
[3:20:28.960 --> 3:20:30.960]  And I hope people aren't paying attention to that.
[3:20:30.960 --> 3:20:32.960]  There's going to be a lot of these.
[3:20:32.960 --> 3:20:36.960]  And maybe today's show will have some impact on the way you view the world
[3:20:36.960 --> 3:20:37.960]  and on your perspective.
[3:20:37.960 --> 3:20:38.960]  I'm hoping that happens.
[3:20:38.960 --> 3:20:40.960]  By the way, you're hearing about all these supplements.
[3:20:40.960 --> 3:20:43.960]  Get them in bulk right now.
[3:20:43.960 --> 3:20:47.960]  I have a feeling that so many of these things will end up being outlawed.
[3:20:47.960 --> 3:20:48.960]  Karma has to win.
[3:20:48.960 --> 3:20:50.960]  And we might as well name the country.
[3:20:50.960 --> 3:20:54.960]  Seriously, while they're renaming all the forts, Fort Bragg, and all these different names,
[3:20:54.960 --> 3:20:57.960]  renaming them, we might as well just rename America.
[3:20:57.960 --> 3:20:58.960]  Pfizerica.
[3:20:58.960 --> 3:21:01.960]  I mean, we are bought and sold by Pfizer now.
[3:21:01.960 --> 3:21:05.960]  So because Pfizer's so dangerous, let me tell you the path that they took
[3:21:05.960 --> 3:21:08.960]  to get themselves into the medical cabal.
[3:21:08.960 --> 3:21:12.960]  This is really interesting and really interesting what they admitted to
[3:21:12.960 --> 3:21:16.960]  when they came up with this invention called a virus.
[3:21:16.960 --> 3:21:17.960]  Okay.
[3:21:17.960 --> 3:21:21.960]  So Simon Flexner, Rockefeller Institute, and Paul Lewis,
[3:21:21.960 --> 3:21:26.960]  who isolated this so-called virus, admitted, and I quote,
[3:21:26.960 --> 3:21:32.960]  we failed to obtain such bacteria from the human material studied by us.
[3:21:32.960 --> 3:21:36.960]  We felt that they could be excluded from consideration,
[3:21:36.960 --> 3:21:39.960]  we just didn't find bacteria.
[3:21:39.960 --> 3:21:44.960]  So we came up with a whole new discovery instead of finding out what it really was.
[3:21:44.960 --> 3:21:46.960]  So convenient.
[3:21:46.960 --> 3:21:49.960]  Anyway, especially when you're trying to make a name for yourself.
[3:21:49.960 --> 3:21:55.960]  So what they did was make this bizarre claim, a leap of faith, not a scientific claim.
[3:21:55.960 --> 3:21:57.960]  It was never based on any science.
[3:21:57.960 --> 3:22:01.960]  Based on greed, based on a takeover, never on any science.
[3:22:01.960 --> 3:22:03.960]  I love the word science, don't you?
[3:22:03.960 --> 3:22:07.960]  Anyway, where is Bill Nye, the entertainer guy when you need him, right?
[3:22:07.960 --> 3:22:14.960]  So they took their hypothesis of this thing and they said they had made it a fact
[3:22:14.960 --> 3:22:16.960]  with no proof whatsoever.
[3:22:16.960 --> 3:22:20.960]  And they said therefore the infecting agent of the epidemic, polio,
[3:22:20.960 --> 3:22:27.960]  belongs to the class of the minute and filterable viruses that have not thus far been demonstrated
[3:22:27.960 --> 3:22:32.960]  because, you know, we just made it up so we really can't demonstrate it with certainty under the microscope.
[3:22:32.960 --> 3:22:34.960]  You get that, right?
[3:22:34.960 --> 3:22:37.960]  They couldn't show you what it is on its own.
[3:22:37.960 --> 3:22:42.960]  They can't take a sample from you and show you a virus.
[3:22:42.960 --> 3:22:49.960]  They have to passage it, dredge it through five different diseases, comes out on the other end
[3:22:49.960 --> 3:22:52.960]  and then they say you have this particular virus.
[3:22:52.960 --> 3:22:54.960]  It's very crafty, it's very clever.
[3:22:54.960 --> 3:23:01.960]  Simon Flexner simply asserted it must be named this discovery of polio that was killing the monkeys.
[3:23:01.960 --> 3:23:04.960]  Instead of, you know, where they were like injecting into them
[3:23:04.960 --> 3:23:07.960]  because they couldn't find any other explanation.
[3:23:07.960 --> 3:23:10.960]  So this was not scientific isolation.
[3:23:10.960 --> 3:23:17.960]  It was just speculation, assumptions and honestly, they just wanted to come up with something new.
[3:23:17.960 --> 3:23:23.960]  So they admitted this in December 18th, 1909 in the JMA.
[3:23:23.960 --> 3:23:26.960]  J-A-M-A, I should say that better.
[3:23:26.960 --> 3:23:31.960]  The nature of the virus of epidemic poliomyelitis.
[3:23:31.960 --> 3:23:34.960]  Sounds really like, oh, we got this nail, doesn't it?
[3:23:34.960 --> 3:23:36.960]  Sounds really medically.
[3:23:36.960 --> 3:23:41.960]  Okay, the so-called virus they were injecting into the monkeys wasn't pure.
[3:23:41.960 --> 3:23:43.960]  Get this.
[3:23:43.960 --> 3:23:47.960]  It wasn't just a virus sample either from the infected.
[3:23:47.960 --> 3:23:49.960]  This is what they put into it.
[3:23:49.960 --> 3:23:56.960]  Raid spinal cord, fecal matter, flies were ground up, yeah, flies.
[3:23:56.960 --> 3:24:00.960]  And they also, they injected this into the monkeys to induce paralysis.
[3:24:00.960 --> 3:24:06.960]  Well, I'm sure it was if you put all those foreign diseases and grotesque things right into a brain.
[3:24:06.960 --> 3:24:07.960]  I'm sure it would.
[3:24:07.960 --> 3:24:15.960]  It also contained an undetermined amount of contaminants along with it that were unnamed, you know, in the other category.
[3:24:15.960 --> 3:24:22.960]  So until Jonas Salt came along and won approval for the U.S. government in April 1955 for the polio vaccine,
[3:24:22.960 --> 3:24:24.960]  which by the way was already starting to wane.
[3:24:24.960 --> 3:24:26.960]  It was already going down.
[3:24:26.960 --> 3:24:28.960]  It was actually unneeded at that point.
[3:24:28.960 --> 3:24:36.960]  No scientific proof of existence of a virus causing poliomyelitis or infantile paralysis is what they used to call it.
[3:24:36.960 --> 3:24:42.960]  That became the infantile paralysis was the first thing that the government really supported on research,
[3:24:42.960 --> 3:24:44.960]  government money, your money.
[3:24:44.960 --> 3:24:48.960]  And they came up with that, eventually became the March of Dimes.
[3:24:48.960 --> 3:24:49.960]  You'll recognize that.
[3:24:49.960 --> 3:24:57.960]  So what they did was the medical world took over Flexner's word that it has to be a virus.
[3:24:57.960 --> 3:24:59.960]  It just has to be.
[3:24:59.960 --> 3:25:01.960]  It was acclaimed by everyone.
[3:25:01.960 --> 3:25:04.960]  So if you're Simon Flexner and you work for Rockefeller, what do you want?
[3:25:04.960 --> 3:25:09.960]  Oh, you want everybody to acclaim and say how wonderful you are and that you did this thing.
[3:25:09.960 --> 3:25:13.960]  You didn't, but it helps to have some good press.
[3:25:13.960 --> 3:25:18.960]  You know, like when so much of our mainstream media is owned.
[3:25:18.960 --> 3:25:23.960]  So he arranged for his brother, Abraham Flexner, who was only a school teacher,
[3:25:23.960 --> 3:25:28.960]  no medical background whatsoever, to head a joint study with the American Medical Association.
[3:25:28.960 --> 3:25:30.960]  Remember, no medical background.
[3:25:30.960 --> 3:25:34.960]  He went around to all of the schools, all of the medical schools at the time.
[3:25:34.960 --> 3:25:39.960]  There were 165 of them and they took this new Flexner report.
[3:25:39.960 --> 3:25:40.960]  Sounds official, doesn't it?
[3:25:40.960 --> 3:25:46.960]  And they closed down half of the medical schools and they said that they just needed to be closed down.
[3:25:46.960 --> 3:25:47.960]  That's all there was to it.
[3:25:47.960 --> 3:25:51.960]  The school teachers walking around going, yep, you and you, like Oprah, did you get a car?
[3:25:51.960 --> 3:25:54.960]  Like you get, you know, you get to get closed and you get to get closed.
[3:25:54.960 --> 3:25:55.960]  That sort of thing.
[3:25:55.960 --> 3:26:00.960]  It changed everything we know about the medical world because it was a kind of a silent takeover.
[3:26:00.960 --> 3:26:07.960]  And what they did was they deemed them that they weren't, you know, hip enough to go along with the AMA
[3:26:07.960 --> 3:26:14.960]  and be controlled and they liked their homeopathic remedies and the country doctor up to that point.
[3:26:14.960 --> 3:26:16.960]  This is how they trained.
[3:26:16.960 --> 3:26:21.960]  They trained the country doctors that were solving problems left and right without all the side effects of pharma.
[3:26:21.960 --> 3:26:22.960]  So what do you have to do?
[3:26:22.960 --> 3:26:26.960]  If you're trying to tab a takeover and you invent something called a virus,
[3:26:26.960 --> 3:26:28.960]  you want to control the medical schools.
[3:26:28.960 --> 3:26:30.960]  So that's all they learn about, right?
[3:26:30.960 --> 3:26:32.960]  And so they also take it as fact.
[3:26:32.960 --> 3:26:36.960]  It's really easy to do that when you own the medical schools
[3:26:36.960 --> 3:26:39.960]  and you get rid of any medical schools that won't go along with you.
[3:26:39.960 --> 3:26:42.960]  Smart, very smart.
[3:26:42.960 --> 3:26:49.960]  So the Flexler Report from the Rockefeller Institute wanted to destroy medicine and replace it with pharma.
[3:26:49.960 --> 3:26:55.960]  So really what they were saying was we want to get rid of health and we want to replace it with pharma.
[3:26:55.960 --> 3:26:58.960]  And the outcome of the report was very predetermined.
[3:26:58.960 --> 3:27:02.960]  So the Rockefellers and the AMA were about to take over
[3:27:02.960 --> 3:27:09.960]  and the Rockefeller money went into all these select schools and they were able to vet all the professors, right?
[3:27:09.960 --> 3:27:20.960]  And they were actually able to target chiropractic, osteopaths, independent, holistic, you know, schools
[3:27:20.960 --> 3:27:24.960]  just so they can make it so that you had to join the AMA.
[3:27:24.960 --> 3:27:25.960]  It's very smart.
[3:27:25.960 --> 3:27:31.960]  The Rockefeller money went to all of this and they had to accept Pasteur's germ theory of disease.
[3:27:31.960 --> 3:27:33.960]  They had to accept it.
[3:27:33.960 --> 3:27:40.960]  There was no debate which claims one germ to one disease reductionism.
[3:27:40.960 --> 3:27:46.960]  Rockefeller-controlled media launched a coordinated witch hunt against all these different forms of alternative medicine.
[3:27:46.960 --> 3:27:56.960]  And that's when things like marijuana, all these different things started to be demonized by the Flexler Report.
[3:27:56.960 --> 3:28:02.960]  They started to demonize any kind of natural vitamin, herbal remedy and chiropractic.
[3:28:02.960 --> 3:28:03.960]  Why?
[3:28:03.960 --> 3:28:09.960]  Because pharma, when they started all their chemical use and they started making all these chemicals, right?
[3:28:09.960 --> 3:28:16.960]  They wanted those chemicals to win and they wanted those chemicals that were used in World War II with the Nazis.
[3:28:16.960 --> 3:28:20.960]  I mean, they really wanted these chemicals to prevail and they were about to.
[3:28:20.960 --> 3:28:27.960]  So, the Rockefeller Institute's virology laboratory came about.
[3:28:27.960 --> 3:28:29.960]  That's how it came about.
[3:28:29.960 --> 3:28:30.960]  That's how they named it.
[3:28:30.960 --> 3:28:33.960]  It was a brand new entire field of study.
[3:28:33.960 --> 3:28:35.960]  Not only that, it's a laboratory.
[3:28:35.960 --> 3:28:41.960]  It's an independent field separate from bacteriology during the 1920s.
[3:28:41.960 --> 3:28:43.960]  Isn't that crazy?
[3:28:43.960 --> 3:28:46.960]  And they realized they could manipulate far easier.
[3:28:46.960 --> 3:28:50.960]  Just claim the deadly pathogens were invisible germs.
[3:28:50.960 --> 3:28:51.960]  Easy stuff.
[3:28:51.960 --> 3:28:53.960]  Be right back on The Alex Jones Show.
[3:28:53.960 --> 3:28:55.960]  I'm Kate Dahlia, your guest host.

[3:29:35.960 --> 3:29:39.960]  finally our flagship product back in stock.
[3:29:39.960 --> 3:29:42.960]  It keeps us on the air and it's going to sell out quick.
[3:29:42.960 --> 3:29:50.960]  But despite that, we're offering it for 50% off at infowarstore.com
[3:29:50.960 --> 3:29:55.960]  to support our longtime viewers and listeners and for new folks to take advantage of it.
[3:29:55.960 --> 3:30:02.960]  Alex Jones expanded his broadcast by selling a line of products focused on healing from the toxic world
[3:30:02.960 --> 3:30:08.960]  of a corrupt system, which has allowed Info Wars to remain a free public broadcast
[3:30:08.960 --> 3:30:12.960]  to combat the dangerous lies of the mainstream media.
[3:30:12.960 --> 3:30:19.960]  Alex Jones is patient zero for alternative facts.
[3:30:19.960 --> 3:30:22.960]  Do you understand what I have said?
[3:30:22.960 --> 3:30:25.960]  Yes, I believe what I said was true.
[3:30:25.960 --> 3:30:28.960]  Yes, you believe everything you say is true, but it isn't.
[3:30:28.960 --> 3:30:31.960]  Your beliefs do not make something true.
[3:30:31.960 --> 3:30:34.960]  That is what we're doing here.
[3:30:34.960 --> 3:30:39.960]  There's going to be a large set of plaintiffs who are going to be dividing up the corpse of Info Wars
[3:30:39.960 --> 3:30:41.960]  in the bankruptcy estate.
[3:30:41.960 --> 3:30:47.960]  The Info Wars audience has mobilized and awakened the world to the threat that is globalism.
[3:30:47.960 --> 3:30:50.960]  And with your continued support, we will keep going.
[3:30:50.960 --> 3:30:55.960]  Join us now and support the Info War.
[3:30:55.960 --> 3:30:58.960]  People say Alex Jones is crazy. He's a conspiracy theory guy. He's a nutcase.
[3:30:58.960 --> 3:31:01.960]  He's got these rants and all that.
[3:31:01.960 --> 3:31:09.960]  What they miss is that this guy is ahead of the curve on so many different topics of signal, not noise.
[3:31:09.960 --> 3:31:15.960]  If you look at the signal and you compare that to PBS and NPR and BBC
[3:31:15.960 --> 3:31:21.960]  and we'll do what Alex Jones put out there versus what your collective body has put out there.
[3:31:21.960 --> 3:31:25.960]  And if you're a sent in human being and just watching it, you say, well, Alex Jones was ahead of this.
[3:31:25.960 --> 3:31:27.960]  Not only that, he kind of explained it.
[3:31:27.960 --> 3:31:30.960]  You are one of the great thinkers of this.
[3:31:30.960 --> 3:31:35.960]  It is very rare. You've got to go back almost to the revolutionary generation and see that.
[3:31:35.960 --> 3:31:39.960]  In this new book, I've got to tell you, when Tony Lyons first approached me, I read this thing.
[3:31:39.960 --> 3:31:43.960]  I go, this is it. This is no Beatrix. You're not going to be flipping pages.
[3:31:43.960 --> 3:31:46.960]  You're going to be having a pinout. You're going to be underlining stuff.

[3:32:44.960 --> 3:32:48.960]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is a symbiotic relationship.
[3:32:48.960 --> 3:32:53.960]  Supporting InfoWars defeats the globalist and this product does amazing things for your body.
[3:32:53.960 --> 3:32:56.960]  Take action now.
[3:32:56.960 --> 3:33:07.960]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[3:33:07.960 --> 3:33:22.960]  So ironically, the word virus comes from Latin. You know the meaning? Poison.
[3:33:22.960 --> 3:33:27.960]  Poison. Anyway, I know. Fun fact.
[3:33:27.960 --> 3:33:33.960]  Virology was a creation of the Rockefeller Medical Cabal.
[3:33:33.960 --> 3:33:43.960]  Let me repeat that. Virology was a creation of the Rockefellers, the Medical Cabal, the Takeover.
[3:33:43.960 --> 3:33:55.960]  And in medicine, diseases like smallpox, measles, poliomyelitis declared to be caused by invisible pathogens, specific viruses, right?
[3:33:55.960 --> 3:34:03.960]  If scientists could isolate the invisible virus, theoretically they could find vaccines to protect people from harm.
[3:34:03.960 --> 3:34:17.960]  Wow. So their theory was then launched and the government got in on financing an entire vaccine program.
[3:34:17.960 --> 3:34:27.960]  An entire vaccine program built on the back of pharma, who by the way had done their experimentation in World War II and were ready to go.
[3:34:27.960 --> 3:34:33.960]  That's really something I think that needs to sink in for people to see this in the big picture.
[3:34:33.960 --> 3:34:42.960]  Because the perspective of what we've been taught and how true this Truman Show really is, is vital to us fighting this.
[3:34:42.960 --> 3:34:47.960]  You have to know what game you're playing in order to fight it, right?
[3:34:47.960 --> 3:34:52.960]  So they never proved it was contagious. They never proved it was infectious.
[3:34:52.960 --> 3:34:55.960]  Or a disease caused by an airborne virus.
[3:34:55.960 --> 3:35:02.960]  Now it's starting to make sense why the doctors and nurses and doctors' offices of sick people don't get sick.
[3:35:02.960 --> 3:35:05.960]  When your spouse has the flu, you don't get the flu.
[3:35:05.960 --> 3:35:11.960]  When somebody in your household had what they called COVID, you didn't get it.
[3:35:11.960 --> 3:35:19.960]  Why is that? How could that be if it's so rapid, so infectious that you must wear a hazmat suit with a hose coming out of your head?
[3:35:19.960 --> 3:35:22.960]  Ah, because that was a lie.
[3:35:22.960 --> 3:35:29.960]  So the lie of the contagious infectious disease caused by an airborne virus was launched.
[3:35:29.960 --> 3:35:36.960]  And then of course you have to have the solution kind of like how they developed the vaccine before they even named COVID.
[3:35:36.960 --> 3:35:40.960]  It was so simple because they already had the shots ready. You already have them in production.
[3:35:40.960 --> 3:35:46.960]  You don't need to know what the virus is. You already have the cure. I like that.
[3:35:46.960 --> 3:35:48.960]  It's backwards, but I like it, right?
[3:35:48.960 --> 3:35:55.960]  And so if you can control a populace by saying that people can spread it,
[3:35:55.960 --> 3:36:00.960]  because back in the day people were told to wear masks and cover up and stay home,
[3:36:00.960 --> 3:36:03.960]  then of course you have all the control in the world, right?
[3:36:03.960 --> 3:36:06.960]  All you have to do is say it's highly contagious.
[3:36:06.960 --> 3:36:13.960]  And so they even admitted that they had not proven how the disease even enters the body of a human being.
[3:36:13.960 --> 3:36:16.960]  And as one experienced doctor pointed out in a medical journal, they said,
[3:36:16.960 --> 3:36:24.960]  our present knowledge of the possible methods of contagion is based almost entirely upon the work done in the city at the Rockefeller Institute.
[3:36:24.960 --> 3:36:30.960]  Interesting how they're the only ones that seem to know all about virology and no one else.
[3:36:30.960 --> 3:36:31.960]  Amazing.
[3:36:31.960 --> 3:36:36.960]  So there was some pushback. Several doctors came out and said, you know, this is not a thing.
[3:36:36.960 --> 3:36:39.960]  This is not a finding. What in the world are we doing?
[3:36:39.960 --> 3:36:42.960]  But they had to have three things happen during this time.
[3:36:42.960 --> 3:36:48.960]  There was a plan, a conspiracy between the people at Rockefeller and the AMA,
[3:36:48.960 --> 3:36:52.960]  and they wanted public health. And in a free society, you don't need public health.
[3:36:52.960 --> 3:36:55.960]  They wanted public health controlled at a federal level.
[3:36:55.960 --> 3:36:59.960]  They wanted Johns Hopkins to be the mouthpiece and training ground for the medical cabal.
[3:36:59.960 --> 3:37:03.960]  During the COVID thing, Loved, what did you often hear about?
[3:37:03.960 --> 3:37:08.960]  You often heard Johns Hopkins telling you what was going on, right?
[3:37:08.960 --> 3:37:11.960]  And then they honestly invented that brand new thing called virus.
[3:37:11.960 --> 3:37:20.960]  So they could come up with an entire vaccine program at a time when we had great sanitation and we did not need a vaccine program.
[3:37:20.960 --> 3:37:25.960]  But they were going to push it on the people and they were going to tell you you needed it and make you very, very, very afraid.
[3:37:25.960 --> 3:37:32.960]  So during the 1930s, they had economic depression and war, outbreaks, a little few outbreaks here and there.
[3:37:32.960 --> 3:37:36.960]  And I do have a big question for you.
[3:37:36.960 --> 3:37:40.960]  What caused those? Because along comes DDT, World War II.
[3:37:40.960 --> 3:37:44.960]  They start spraying the fields. Henry Cum was a consultant to the U.S. Army.
[3:37:44.960 --> 3:37:48.960]  He oversaw the field studies of spraying DDT at the time.
[3:37:48.960 --> 3:37:50.960]  They said it was safe. It wasn't.
[3:37:50.960 --> 3:37:53.960]  And he later became a part of the Rockefeller Institute.
[3:37:53.960 --> 3:37:56.960]  Isn't that amazing? Yeah, little job promotion.
[3:37:56.960 --> 3:38:00.960]  The use of DDT, they said, was against typhus and malaria.
[3:38:00.960 --> 3:38:02.960]  Did you know that we didn't have a problem with malaria?
[3:38:02.960 --> 3:38:08.960]  I think we had like six deaths from malaria in the entire United States for like a course of like four years.
[3:38:08.960 --> 3:38:12.960]  There was no need for this, but they came over and they started spraying it.
[3:38:12.960 --> 3:38:16.960]  They started telling you you had to spray your cows with it, all your vegetables, all your fruits, everything.
[3:38:16.960 --> 3:38:22.960]  And that it needed to be covered with this DDT so that you wouldn't have these things, right?
[3:38:22.960 --> 3:38:27.960]  So they started spraying it and all of a sudden polio started this huge outbreak
[3:38:27.960 --> 3:38:32.960]  and started to, all these polio symptoms, okay, started to show up.
[3:38:32.960 --> 3:38:35.960]  Why were they showing up? This was so strange, right?
[3:38:35.960 --> 3:38:42.960]  And what a correlation, though. What a correlation from cases to when they were spraying.
[3:38:42.960 --> 3:38:48.960]  Because why did it start to wane, even when we didn't have Jonas Salk and the vaccine,
[3:38:48.960 --> 3:38:52.960]  is because they started, a year before it started to wane on the polio cases,
[3:38:52.960 --> 3:38:56.960]  they were, they were, the farmers were told to spray less
[3:38:56.960 --> 3:39:02.960]  because there was some information coming out saying that it was more dangerous and toxic than they had thought.
[3:39:02.960 --> 3:39:07.960]  And that there were untested side effects. Yeah. Crazy, right?
[3:39:07.960 --> 3:39:12.960]  So the toxic effect on all of these vegetables and plants, and you have to remember,
[3:39:12.960 --> 3:39:14.960]  this is when we started mass producing food.
[3:39:14.960 --> 3:39:16.960]  This is about the time we started mass producing food.
[3:39:16.960 --> 3:39:21.960]  Chemicals were going into the food and we needed all these little agencies running around
[3:39:21.960 --> 3:39:25.960]  to try to, like the FDA and that's provided cover for pharma.
[3:39:25.960 --> 3:39:27.960]  That's why they were erected.
[3:39:27.960 --> 3:39:32.960]  But the FDA, you know, to be there to help us through the use of all these chemicals
[3:39:32.960 --> 3:39:34.960]  and make us so-called safe.
[3:39:34.960 --> 3:39:38.960]  They didn't say take the chemicals out, they would just say reduce the chemicals.
[3:39:38.960 --> 3:39:45.960]  It's interesting that it used to be DDT and today we have glyphosate over spring.
[3:39:45.960 --> 3:39:49.960]  Huh. Are they doing it to us again?
[3:39:49.960 --> 3:39:55.960]  Autism started to spike in 1995 when they started over spraying glyphosate.
[3:39:55.960 --> 3:39:57.960]  That's kind of interesting correlation.
[3:39:57.960 --> 3:40:01.960]  That comes from Stephanie Sinoff, Dr. Stephanie Sinoff from MIT.
[3:40:01.960 --> 3:40:05.960]  So you just keep renaming it and you just keep calling it safe,
[3:40:05.960 --> 3:40:10.960]  still poisoning us from the sky, from everything.
[3:40:10.960 --> 3:40:13.960]  It's kind of amazing how they were able to do it.
[3:40:13.960 --> 3:40:16.960]  So Henry Cum became the director of polio research,
[3:40:16.960 --> 3:40:19.960]  the same guy who oversaw the DDT spraying.
[3:40:19.960 --> 3:40:21.960]  Doesn't it make you feel warm and cozy?
[3:40:21.960 --> 3:40:22.960]  It does me.
[3:40:22.960 --> 3:40:23.960]  I love that.
[3:40:23.960 --> 3:40:27.960]  And he also funded the polio vaccine research of Jonas Salk.
[3:40:27.960 --> 3:40:28.960]  I know.
[3:40:28.960 --> 3:40:30.960]  It's kind of like they're all in a big old bed together.
[3:40:30.960 --> 3:40:31.960]  Doesn't it feel like that?
[3:40:31.960 --> 3:40:35.960]  They're all cozy in a big old bed, just all sleeping together.
[3:40:35.960 --> 3:40:40.960]  So there were doctors that gave pushback.
[3:40:40.960 --> 3:40:41.960]  They didn't do enough.
[3:40:41.960 --> 3:40:43.960]  It didn't do enough, and people didn't know what to say.
[3:40:43.960 --> 3:40:45.960]  In fact, there were doctors that came out and said,
[3:40:45.960 --> 3:40:48.960]  vitamin C is a powerful detox.
[3:40:48.960 --> 3:40:50.960]  That can actually help those symptoms.
[3:40:50.960 --> 3:40:53.960]  They didn't go to the cause yet, but they went to the symptoms and they said,
[3:40:53.960 --> 3:40:56.960]  vitamin C, vitamin C, vitamin C.
[3:40:56.960 --> 3:40:59.960]  And they enrolled them in certain things to show people,
[3:40:59.960 --> 3:41:03.960]  hey, we're actually curing people with these vitamins.
[3:41:03.960 --> 3:41:04.960]  Yeah, they didn't like that.
[3:41:04.960 --> 3:41:08.960]  So what the Rockefeller Institute did was they called that Quackery.
[3:41:08.960 --> 3:41:10.960]  Quackery.
[3:41:10.960 --> 3:41:11.960]  Not what we're doing.
[3:41:11.960 --> 3:41:13.960]  What you're doing is quackery.
[3:41:13.960 --> 3:41:14.960]  And those people were alive.
[3:41:14.960 --> 3:41:21.960]  So the Jonas Salk polio shot then sent out 90 million infected polio shots,
[3:41:21.960 --> 3:41:25.960]  all diseased with monkey kidney virus.
[3:41:25.960 --> 3:41:26.960]  Okay.
[3:41:26.960 --> 3:41:27.960]  And didn't tell anybody.
[3:41:27.960 --> 3:41:28.960]  They admitted it later.
[3:41:28.960 --> 3:41:29.960]  I know.
[3:41:29.960 --> 3:41:30.960]  It's always later.
[3:41:30.960 --> 3:41:35.960]  But they sent those out and then cancer went through the roof a decade later.
[3:41:35.960 --> 3:41:37.960]  Interesting, right?
[3:41:37.960 --> 3:41:42.960]  So we have DDT and it was banned in 1972.
[3:41:42.960 --> 3:41:45.960]  Polio then really didn't kind of come up.
[3:41:45.960 --> 3:41:46.960]  The symptoms of polio.
[3:41:46.960 --> 3:41:47.960]  Okay.
[3:41:47.960 --> 3:41:48.960]  So-called polio.
[3:41:48.960 --> 3:41:51.960]  So DDT use goes down.
[3:41:51.960 --> 3:41:53.960]  Polio symptoms go down.
[3:41:53.960 --> 3:41:56.960]  Polio shot starts giving people polio.
[3:41:56.960 --> 3:41:58.960]  It was a whole nother scare.
[3:41:58.960 --> 3:42:02.960]  People started getting it from the shot and they never said you couldn't get it from the shot.
[3:42:02.960 --> 3:42:05.960]  But we got a lot of cases from the shot.
[3:42:05.960 --> 3:42:08.960]  They never in the media as such, of course.
[3:42:08.960 --> 3:42:10.960]  They would never admit to that.
[3:42:10.960 --> 3:42:11.960]  Of course not.
[3:42:11.960 --> 3:42:17.960]  But we got chronic fatigue syndromes and we had meningitis and we had Guillain-Barre syndrome
[3:42:17.960 --> 3:42:18.960]  and we had MS.
[3:42:18.960 --> 3:42:21.960]  All these things started cropping up.
[3:42:21.960 --> 3:42:23.960]  Cancer, one in three in cancer.
[3:42:23.960 --> 3:42:30.960]  And in the year 2022, after we've been taking all their poison remedies for cancer and still dying,
[3:42:30.960 --> 3:42:35.960]  are we ever going to go back to the start of this cabal and ask how these things are happening
[3:42:35.960 --> 3:42:37.960]  and how they're able to pedal these things through pharma?
[3:42:37.960 --> 3:42:40.960]  Are we ever going to ask those kinds of questions?
[3:42:40.960 --> 3:42:43.960]  Are we ever going to see the entire vaccine program for what it is?
[3:42:43.960 --> 3:42:46.960]  Because if there's anything great that's come out of the last two and a half years,
[3:42:46.960 --> 3:42:51.960]  it is an eye-opening experience to be able to see how far your government will go

[3:47:10.960 --> 3:47:12.960]  Welcome back on The Alex Jones Show.
[3:47:12.960 --> 3:47:15.960]  I'm Kay Dally, your guest host for the hour.
[3:47:15.960 --> 3:47:20.960]  So let's get right back to this because there's so much to explore,
[3:47:20.960 --> 3:47:23.960]  and I had a huge question going into this research that I needed to solve.
[3:47:23.960 --> 3:47:27.960]  I needed an answer, so I'll give you one theory or a theory, working theory.
[3:47:27.960 --> 3:47:34.960]  But DDT went away in 1972, as I was saying, and the polio cases fell
[3:47:34.960 --> 3:47:36.960]  even before the shot came about.
[3:47:36.960 --> 3:47:38.960]  You can do your homework on this.
[3:47:38.960 --> 3:47:44.960]  By the way, only 1% of all the polio cases had a problem with paralysis or death.
[3:47:44.960 --> 3:47:46.960]  Very similar to our numbers today.
[3:47:46.960 --> 3:47:51.960]  You know why? With blovid, because you know how it's always 1%?
[3:47:51.960 --> 3:47:53.960]  The vulnerable with 1%?
[3:47:53.960 --> 3:47:56.960]  It's because all of them are that way.
[3:47:56.960 --> 3:47:58.960]  It's always the 1%.
[3:47:58.960 --> 3:48:00.960]  They just want all of you.
[3:48:00.960 --> 3:48:02.960]  It's like munch housings by government.
[3:48:02.960 --> 3:48:07.960]  They want all of you to think you're all vulnerable instead of just the 1%,
[3:48:07.960 --> 3:48:09.960]  which has always been that way.
[3:48:09.960 --> 3:48:15.960]  The Rockefeller Institute and Simon Flexner report that ousted our country doctor
[3:48:15.960 --> 3:48:19.960]  and ousted the way that we did things that actually worked,
[3:48:19.960 --> 3:48:26.960]  and then we got pharma on steroids in their AMA, Rockefeller, Johns Hopkins,
[3:48:26.960 --> 3:48:28.960]  public health cabal.
[3:48:28.960 --> 3:48:30.960]  Public health, what is our main job?
[3:48:30.960 --> 3:48:33.960]  To ensure that you get your vaccines.
[3:48:33.960 --> 3:48:35.960]  How perfect, right?
[3:48:35.960 --> 3:48:37.960]  Give me a break.
[3:48:37.960 --> 3:48:43.960]  So we had this toxic poisoning from DDT that we think was causing the polio surge
[3:48:43.960 --> 3:48:47.960]  because right when they stopped the spring and they started reducing the spring,
[3:48:47.960 --> 3:48:48.960]  those symptoms went away.
[3:48:48.960 --> 3:48:51.960]  You always have to ask what caused something, right?
[3:48:51.960 --> 3:48:54.960]  And I've done some shows on this, so I hope this piece of the puzzle
[3:48:54.960 --> 3:48:58.960]  is making more sense to you today in this presentation.
[3:48:58.960 --> 3:49:00.960]  But let me just say this.
[3:49:00.960 --> 3:49:09.960]  The same Rockefeller group financed the Nazi eugenics at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institutes in Germany
[3:49:09.960 --> 3:49:13.960]  in the 1930s called the American Eugenics Society.
[3:49:13.960 --> 3:49:17.960]  So when I asked last week some questions and I said, hey,
[3:49:17.960 --> 3:49:22.960]  is the Nazi program still just continuing under pharma?
[3:49:22.960 --> 3:49:25.960]  What do you think the answer to that is?
[3:49:25.960 --> 3:49:31.960]  So what caused the initial outbreak in 1915 and 1907?
[3:49:31.960 --> 3:49:34.960]  Because DDT wasn't introduced until it was actually,
[3:49:34.960 --> 3:49:37.960]  it was a Nobel Prize given for its invention,
[3:49:37.960 --> 3:49:41.960]  but it wasn't actually introduced into our system until the 40s.
[3:49:41.960 --> 3:49:44.960]  So really spraying all the time.
[3:49:44.960 --> 3:49:46.960]  So what happened to cause that?
[3:49:46.960 --> 3:49:48.960]  And it just kept getting to me.
[3:49:48.960 --> 3:49:50.960]  I could not answer that question.
[3:49:50.960 --> 3:49:57.960]  So I went back and I looked at New Jersey where they had a majority of the cases in also New York
[3:49:57.960 --> 3:50:03.960]  and there was a Calco Chemical Company that was founded in 1915
[3:50:03.960 --> 3:50:10.960]  at a site close to Bownbrook, New Jersey and it was adjacent to this Raritan River.
[3:50:10.960 --> 3:50:16.960]  So to manufacture coal tar, you know, things and also make synthetic dye stuffs.
[3:50:16.960 --> 3:50:18.960]  Synthetic dye stuffs came from pharma.
[3:50:18.960 --> 3:50:20.960]  That was the precursor to pharma.
[3:50:20.960 --> 3:50:23.960]  Before that we used, you know, dyes from flowers.
[3:50:23.960 --> 3:50:24.960]  We used dyes from things.
[3:50:24.960 --> 3:50:30.960]  And in the field, you guys, we used wild cucumbers and certain flowers to keep the pests away.
[3:50:30.960 --> 3:50:32.960]  We didn't need all these chemicals.
[3:50:32.960 --> 3:50:36.960]  They introduced all these chemicals at the turn of the century.
[3:50:36.960 --> 3:50:41.960]  So America, it became America's cyanide Calco Chemical Division.
[3:50:41.960 --> 3:50:47.960]  And it was interesting because it was very, very close to the area that had the major outbreak.
[3:50:47.960 --> 3:50:51.960]  And then, of course, that river ran through New York and out to the ocean.
[3:50:51.960 --> 3:50:54.960]  And they had some cases going on there.
[3:50:54.960 --> 3:50:56.960]  That's kind of interesting.
[3:50:56.960 --> 3:51:02.960]  So you had all these new synthetic dyes and clothing and fibers and chemicals and everything.
[3:51:02.960 --> 3:51:09.960]  And it's interesting cyanide comes up because a vet just told me that the VA told him he needed B12
[3:51:09.960 --> 3:51:12.960]  and they gave him the cyanide version of it.
[3:51:12.960 --> 3:51:17.960]  It says C-Y-A-N in the very, very first part of it instead of the methyl version.
[3:51:17.960 --> 3:51:21.960]  You always want the methyl version of B12, but they wanted to give him the cyanide version
[3:51:21.960 --> 3:51:23.960]  and he was like, are they trying to kill me?
[3:51:23.960 --> 3:51:30.960]  Well, and so one theory of mine was that this was a spike affecting the immune system.
[3:51:30.960 --> 3:51:35.960]  There had to be something affecting the immune system if they came up with this so-called virus out of thin air.
[3:51:35.960 --> 3:51:37.960]  So what was it?
[3:51:37.960 --> 3:51:39.960]  Was it chemical poisoning?
[3:51:39.960 --> 3:51:41.960]  They started using this.
[3:51:41.960 --> 3:51:43.960]  They started bleaching the flower.
[3:51:43.960 --> 3:51:45.960]  They started doing all of these things at the turn of the century.
[3:51:45.960 --> 3:51:52.960]  They started using this huge amount of chemicals in our massive food production supply chain that we didn't have before.
[3:51:52.960 --> 3:51:54.960]  It used to be local.
[3:51:54.960 --> 3:51:58.960]  You got it from farmers and you made things yourself.
[3:51:58.960 --> 3:52:04.960]  But now we had massive food production, so we started having all these chemicals that pharma introduced, right,
[3:52:04.960 --> 3:52:06.960]  used in all of these things.
[3:52:06.960 --> 3:52:09.960]  Is that why we had the outbreaks in New Jersey and New York?
[3:52:09.960 --> 3:52:12.960]  Just asking the question, right?
[3:52:12.960 --> 3:52:19.960]  Because it was only like what, 32 miles from Boundbrook, New Jersey to Trenton, where Trenton was a huge outbreak?
[3:52:19.960 --> 3:52:21.960]  Strange.
[3:52:21.960 --> 3:52:23.960]  Just a working theory.
[3:52:23.960 --> 3:52:31.960]  And so dye wastewater is considered to be pretty harmful, toxin, carcinogenic to human aquatic life, right?
[3:52:31.960 --> 3:52:37.960]  And what's funny is that when you think of this type of thing, you think people out there, these hippies fighting for the EPA,
[3:52:37.960 --> 3:52:42.960]  they love EPA control even though the EPA is such a cabal and so horrific.
[3:52:42.960 --> 3:52:49.960]  But this is more of like this leftist, you know, I'm going to fight for the chemicals in the water, right?
[3:52:49.960 --> 3:52:55.960]  And it's interesting because we don't ever really look at were we being poisoned.
[3:52:55.960 --> 3:53:02.960]  Was it just our body responding, our immune system responding to all the toxic chemicals they were starting to use?
[3:53:02.960 --> 3:53:04.960]  Pharma was starting to use these.
[3:53:04.960 --> 3:53:11.960]  Everybody was starting to use these and all of a sudden these certain symptoms started cropping up that really hadn't cropped up before.
[3:53:11.960 --> 3:53:22.960]  Hazardous effects of dyes and all their synthetic dyes, dysfunction of the central nervous system, kidney, reproductive system, brain, liver, all of these things.
[3:53:22.960 --> 3:53:24.960]  So let me ask you this.
[3:53:24.960 --> 3:53:29.960]  Was this a way to, you have the FDA crop up and they go after the companies, right?
[3:53:29.960 --> 3:53:33.960]  And they say, okay, you can use less product, less chemicals in the products, right?
[3:53:33.960 --> 3:53:39.960]  We're going to engage how you're doing and we're going to keep tabs on you and you have to go through our control.
[3:53:39.960 --> 3:53:45.960]  But was that an effort to not have it go linked back to pharma?
[3:53:45.960 --> 3:53:49.960]  To not have it say, well, the pharma is the one producing these chemicals.
[3:53:49.960 --> 3:53:52.960]  Pharma is the bad guy in this equation.
[3:53:52.960 --> 3:53:56.960]  No, it was the companies using the chemicals they were given, right?
[3:53:56.960 --> 3:53:58.960]  They were the bad guy, the sole bad guy.
[3:53:58.960 --> 3:54:02.960]  They might have been a bad guy at the time, but they were the sole bad guy.
[3:54:02.960 --> 3:54:08.960]  So was the FDA there to provide cover so that the pharma could get away with this?
[3:54:08.960 --> 3:54:18.960]  And then when they brought the whole vaccine and all their medicines to the forefront, nobody questioned them because the Rockefeller Institute made them into the hero, saving the day.
[3:54:18.960 --> 3:54:21.960]  Here we come to save the day, you know?
[3:54:21.960 --> 3:54:23.960]  I mean, look at it.
[3:54:23.960 --> 3:54:25.960]  What do we do in medicine?
[3:54:25.960 --> 3:54:29.960]  The doctors will tell you that we wouldn't be anywhere if it wasn't for vaccines.
[3:54:29.960 --> 3:54:31.960]  They have saved us.
[3:54:31.960 --> 3:54:33.960]  How so?
[3:54:33.960 --> 3:54:35.960]  Really?
[3:54:35.960 --> 3:54:37.960]  Do they really believe that?
[3:54:37.960 --> 3:54:41.960]  How many times are we injected with something that hurts our immune system?
[3:54:41.960 --> 3:54:44.960]  Because you either get a bacteria, right?
[3:54:44.960 --> 3:54:50.960]  Or you are, your immune system is reacting to something that's happening.
[3:54:50.960 --> 3:54:51.960]  It would have to be that.
[3:54:51.960 --> 3:54:54.960]  We're consistently sprayed all the time, right?
[3:54:54.960 --> 3:54:55.960]  Like cattle.
[3:54:55.960 --> 3:54:57.960]  We should just start mowing seriously.
[3:54:57.960 --> 3:55:00.960]  That's how it feels anyway.
[3:55:00.960 --> 3:55:11.960]  So there was a lot more to that story about the chemical manufacturing because a couple years later, they started getting reports that maybe some things were happening with the people, you think?
[3:55:11.960 --> 3:55:18.960]  But there had to be an answer to some chemical poisoning and that chemical plant was the only new thing in the area.
[3:55:18.960 --> 3:55:20.960]  It was the only thing that had changed.
[3:55:20.960 --> 3:55:23.960]  And when you go to certain areas, you have to say, okay, what in that area changed?
[3:55:23.960 --> 3:55:24.960]  What was different?
[3:55:24.960 --> 3:55:26.960]  What would have been causing these symptoms all of a sudden?
[3:55:26.960 --> 3:55:31.960]  They spray in the spring, right, and people were getting all these symptoms in the summer.
[3:55:31.960 --> 3:55:33.960]  It was like the summertime disease.
[3:55:33.960 --> 3:55:36.960]  Isn't that interesting?
[3:55:36.960 --> 3:55:39.960]  So, and they're spraying again right now.
[3:55:39.960 --> 3:55:42.960]  Right now we're back into the fall and spray season, right?
[3:55:42.960 --> 3:55:43.960]  Cover your heads.
[3:55:43.960 --> 3:55:49.960]  So are doctors taught in medical school, is there a section called chemical poisoning?
[3:55:49.960 --> 3:55:56.960]  That would be interesting, wouldn't it, because they would start to really see the effects of what pharma does to the body and what chemicals do to the body.
[3:55:56.960 --> 3:55:59.960]  Our bodies weren't made for chemicals.
[3:55:59.960 --> 3:56:04.960]  Do they question why we need an entire vaccine program if we have great sanitation?
[3:56:04.960 --> 3:56:06.960]  Why doesn't anyone question that?
[3:56:06.960 --> 3:56:12.960]  Why are we consistently taught that we have to have all of these shots to be okay?
[3:56:12.960 --> 3:56:16.960]  We also were taught that it was infectious and contagious.
[3:56:16.960 --> 3:56:17.960]  Really?
[3:56:17.960 --> 3:56:28.960]  So does that explain why Amazon workers, postal workers, people at Costco that worked there and of course Walmart workers never got sick if they were so-called around people all the time?
[3:56:28.960 --> 3:56:30.960]  In the heart of COVID.
[3:56:30.960 --> 3:56:32.960]  Lovid.
[3:56:32.960 --> 3:56:33.960]  You know?
[3:56:33.960 --> 3:56:37.960]  It must not be very contagious and it must not be very infectious.
[3:56:37.960 --> 3:56:44.960]  Maybe it just means that your immune system has either been hit pretty hard or not hit hard and that your immune system is reacting.
[3:56:44.960 --> 3:56:49.960]  And this is why whole families of people don't get sick at the same time.
[3:56:49.960 --> 3:56:53.960]  Because maybe it's not so infectious and not so contagious.
[3:56:53.960 --> 3:56:59.960]  Have you ever wondered why antibiotics don't work for virus but only bacteria?
[3:56:59.960 --> 3:57:00.960]  Hmm.
[3:57:00.960 --> 3:57:02.960]  I hear crickets.
[3:57:02.960 --> 3:57:04.960]  Have you ever wondered why?
[3:57:04.960 --> 3:57:06.960]  Could this possibly answer that question?
[3:57:06.960 --> 3:57:08.960]  Oh yeah, that doesn't touch a virus.
[3:57:08.960 --> 3:57:11.960]  You just have to go home and take some vitamin C and some Tylenol.
[3:57:11.960 --> 3:57:13.960]  Boy, what a convenient answer.
[3:57:13.960 --> 3:57:17.960]  And why would the control take over happen if they weren't trying to hide something?
[3:57:17.960 --> 3:57:21.960]  Why did they need to take control of all the hospital training grounds for the doctors?
[3:57:21.960 --> 3:57:25.960]  All of the different buildings they had and the places they had.
[3:57:25.960 --> 3:57:29.960]  Why did they have to control that if they weren't trying to control what they were learning?
[3:57:29.960 --> 3:57:31.960]  Because what they were doing was just fine.
[3:57:31.960 --> 3:57:33.960]  Buy extra supplements right now.
[3:57:33.960 --> 3:57:36.960]  Buy as many as you can to help your immune system.
[3:57:36.960 --> 3:57:37.960]  Please.
[3:57:37.960 --> 3:57:40.960]  You need to do this and you need to have a whole lot of them.
[3:57:40.960 --> 3:57:43.960]  I'm Kate Deli, your guest host for the Alex Jones Show.
[3:57:43.960 --> 3:58:12.960]  Thank you so much.
[3:58:19.960 --> 3:58:22.960]  So it is a true 360 win-win situation.
[3:58:22.960 --> 3:58:25.960]  When you go to infowarstore.com and get DNA Force Plus,
[3:58:25.960 --> 3:58:29.960]  finally our flagship product back in stock.
[3:58:29.960 --> 3:58:32.960]  It keeps us on the air and it's going to sell out quick.
[3:58:32.960 --> 3:58:40.960]  But despite that, we're offering it for 50% off at infowarstore.com
[3:58:40.960 --> 3:58:45.960]  to support our longtime viewers and listeners and for new folks to take advantage of it.
[3:58:45.960 --> 3:58:48.960]  I don't care if you work in a cafeteria or a pump gas,
[3:58:48.960 --> 3:58:52.960]  or whether you're a farmer, a rancher, a doctor, a lawyer, or a millionaire.
[3:58:52.960 --> 3:58:55.960]  Fortune and Money Magazine have all done these profiles.
[3:58:55.960 --> 3:58:56.960]  You see it every year.
[3:58:56.960 --> 3:58:58.960]  30 different tax returns, 30 different answers.
[3:58:58.960 --> 3:59:01.960]  50 different tax returns, 50 different answers.
[3:59:01.960 --> 3:59:04.960]  And almost all of them just screw you over,
[3:59:04.960 --> 3:59:07.960]  especially the big firms and the big tax grids,
[3:59:07.960 --> 3:59:10.960]  because they're part of the system and they don't want the general public
[3:59:10.960 --> 3:59:12.960]  understanding this and knowing this.
[3:59:12.960 --> 3:59:15.960]  So it's a very important situation with inflation
[3:59:15.960 --> 3:59:17.960]  and all the things out there hurting everybody.
[3:59:17.960 --> 3:59:21.960]  To be able to do things tax-wise, it's legal and lawful,
[3:59:21.960 --> 3:59:23.960]  that allows you to keep more of your money.
[3:59:23.960 --> 3:59:28.960]  We wouldn't even be here if I hadn't gotten great tax advice in the last few years.
[3:59:28.960 --> 3:59:32.960]  The only way you fail is not writing down the URL,
[3:59:32.960 --> 3:59:37.960]  but you can just go to the website, www.johnstaxrelief.com.
