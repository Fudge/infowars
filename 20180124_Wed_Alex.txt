[00:00.000 --> 00:29.360]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:29.360 --> 00:32.880]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are back live broadcasting worldwide.
[00:32.880 --> 00:39.240]  Thank you so much for joining us on this live Wednesday, the 24th day of January, 2018.
[00:39.240 --> 00:43.720]  We're going to be live here for the next four hours, and then Owen Schreuer, Roger Stone
[00:43.720 --> 00:46.400]  and others take over for the War Room.
[00:46.400 --> 00:49.120]  This is, again, Imple Wars Live is what I call it.
[00:49.120 --> 00:50.320]  It's the Alex Jones show.
[00:50.320 --> 00:56.920]  I've been on air here in this very slot now for 20 years, been on air for almost 23 total.
[00:56.920 --> 01:01.520]  And I've never been living through crazier, more interesting, more tumultuous times, as
[01:01.520 --> 01:03.440]  I know almost all of you would agree.
[01:03.440 --> 01:07.880]  I don't think anybody would disagree that the world isn't more crazy, more wild than
[01:07.880 --> 01:08.880]  it's ever been.
[01:08.880 --> 01:11.560]  More happens in a week than used to happen in, you know, a whole month.
[01:11.560 --> 01:13.240]  It is just crazy.
[01:13.240 --> 01:18.120]  And all the awakening that's happening, here's a London Telegraph article.
[01:18.120 --> 01:25.240]  The world must wake up as a threat from tech giants and their worldwide authoritarian takeover.
[01:25.240 --> 01:26.840]  Where have I heard that before?
[01:26.840 --> 01:28.480]  That's what they're doing.
[01:28.480 --> 01:31.080]  In fact, I never even got to it yesterday.
[01:31.080 --> 01:32.400]  We just pulled me yesterday's stack.
[01:32.400 --> 01:36.320]  There was an article out of Breitbart where Rupert Murdoch, who's got the president's
[01:36.320 --> 01:44.040]  ear now, is lobbying for internet censorship even worse than what we previously heard from.
[01:44.040 --> 01:49.240]  Because see, it's not just the big tech giants, it's news corps jockeying in to control the
[01:49.240 --> 01:50.240]  internet.
[01:50.240 --> 01:51.240]  It is just a mess.
[01:51.240 --> 01:55.560]  So I'm going to get to that coming up, because all this other news hasn't distracted from
[01:55.560 --> 01:57.080]  it, but it's really central.
[01:57.080 --> 01:58.080]  It's really important.
[01:58.080 --> 02:01.400]  You've got the big telecoms want to take over, you've got the big tech giants want to take
[02:01.400 --> 02:05.200]  over, and they all want monopolies, and those deals are being made right now.
[02:05.200 --> 02:10.440]  And as much as I like seeing, they had a CNN out.
[02:10.440 --> 02:14.820]  We knew that was coming, and that's all part of the AT&T Time Warner merger.
[02:14.820 --> 02:18.720]  And so you're going to see some different behavior now out of CNN, or you're going to
[02:18.720 --> 02:25.200]  see as Murdoch's told the president, they are going to spin it off and shell it to Bezos
[02:25.200 --> 02:31.480]  or Soros is the word, oh my gosh, unbelievable.
[02:31.480 --> 02:36.160]  And this is Rupert Murdoch talking to the president daily, even though he supported Hillary
[02:36.160 --> 02:39.600]  Clinton over the president and tried to stop the president.
[02:39.600 --> 02:43.200]  He is the biggest sickofant brown-noser on the planet.
[02:43.200 --> 02:47.520]  You've got to hand it to him at almost 90 years old, though he's smart and he works
[02:47.520 --> 02:49.440]  really hard.
[02:49.440 --> 02:52.160]  But can you just leave the internet alone?
[02:52.160 --> 02:54.520]  Can you just leave our free speech alone?
[02:54.520 --> 03:00.200]  He's asking Facebook to completely censor everything that mainstream news off and not
[03:00.200 --> 03:02.760]  even let you post it.
[03:02.760 --> 03:08.400]  And then he wants to make Facebook pay to then have access to what he calls real news,
[03:08.400 --> 03:11.600]  The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal and Fox.
[03:11.600 --> 03:12.600]  Wow.
[03:12.600 --> 03:16.880]  So again, we got the left trying to take over the web, and they're the big powerful group
[03:16.880 --> 03:19.720]  that's close to doing it worldwide with George Soros and the UN.
[03:19.720 --> 03:21.200]  They're the big issue.
[03:21.200 --> 03:23.600]  They're the big cyclops we're facing.
[03:23.600 --> 03:26.480]  But behind that comes Rupert Murdoch and everybody else.
[03:26.480 --> 03:27.960]  It just never ends.
[03:27.960 --> 03:28.960]  So that's coming up.
[03:28.960 --> 03:33.360]  But the big news, when we return, ladies and gentlemen, I just want to get it out there
[03:33.360 --> 03:35.680]  that we're going to cover that today.
[03:35.680 --> 03:41.600]  The big news is on drudgereport.com, and it just fits to all their public statements.
[03:41.600 --> 03:48.520]  Report missing FBI text messages include threats of violence against the president, and it's
[03:48.520 --> 03:52.320]  top linked up on drudgereport.com.
[03:52.320 --> 03:59.000]  So we're going to be covering that in great detail and all the other news that's on drudgereport.com.
[03:59.000 --> 04:00.000]  Good one.
[04:00.000 --> 04:02.400]  Evidence suggests massive scandal brewing at FBI.
[04:02.400 --> 04:06.080]  Bustleblower, secret society held off site meetings.
[04:06.080 --> 04:11.160]  Mystery, five months of missing messages, agents texted about deleting text that they're
[04:11.160 --> 04:13.080]  caught doing it.
[04:13.080 --> 04:19.000]  Total absconding, total obstruction, total racketeering, red-handed, open and shut, threats
[04:19.000 --> 04:26.640]  of violence, knives out at the bureau, poll 58 percent, the FBI hiding something.
[04:26.640 --> 04:32.360]  Collusion course, Congress tightening news around investigation, Mueller leaks obstruction
[04:32.360 --> 04:35.040]  witnesses.
[04:35.040 --> 04:41.600]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is on like donkey kong, and it's all coming up straight ahead
[04:41.600 --> 04:44.120]  on the other side of this global transmission.
[04:44.120 --> 04:49.600]  No, in Alaska earthquake, fear grows from Mount St. Helens volcano, eruption after mega
[04:49.600 --> 04:52.680]  massive 8.2.
[04:52.680 --> 04:54.320]  That's ultra huge.
[04:54.320 --> 04:59.640]  We'll be back infowars.com, newswars.com.
[04:59.640 --> 05:03.000]  Introducing Cell Force by Infowars Life.
[05:03.000 --> 05:07.080]  Cell Force focuses on mitochondria efficiency and protection.
[05:07.080 --> 05:09.840]  Mitochondria produce over 95 percent of your energy.
[05:09.840 --> 05:12.840]  They are your body's cellular engines.
[05:12.840 --> 05:17.160]  Cell Force helps promote your cellular energy production by supporting mitochondria, much
[05:17.160 --> 05:19.640]  like a cellular engine overhaul.
[05:19.640 --> 05:23.640]  Because when your mitochondria don't run at 100 percent efficiency, then they start
[05:23.640 --> 05:26.560]  producing reactive oxygen species.
[05:26.560 --> 05:31.720]  Top scientists agree that aging is most likely caused by cellular damage, resulting from
[05:31.720 --> 05:34.640]  these reactive oxygen species.
[05:34.640 --> 05:39.680]  The antioxidants found in Cell Force are some of the most powerful available on the market.
[05:39.680 --> 05:44.520]  The stronger the antioxidant, the better its ability to scavenge for these reactive oxygen
[05:44.520 --> 05:47.040]  species and other free radicals.
[05:47.040 --> 05:52.320]  Boost, protect, and adapt with Cell Force from Infowars Life.
[05:52.320 --> 06:17.120]  Head to infowarslife.com or call 1-888-253-3139.
[06:17.120 --> 06:30.440]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center, in the heart of the Resistance.
[06:30.440 --> 06:31.440]  It's Alex Jones.
[06:31.440 --> 06:32.440]  It's Wednesday, the 24th of January, 2018.
[06:32.440 --> 06:33.440]  I am your host, Alex Jones.
[06:33.440 --> 06:38.440]  We're going to be here for the next four hours live in the War Room with Owen Schroyer.
[06:38.440 --> 06:42.840]  Paul Watson with Huge Breaking News joins us, the bottom of the hour from London, England.
[06:42.840 --> 06:48.240]  Dan Lyman, our Infowars.com reporter in Europe, is at Davos.
[06:48.240 --> 06:50.080]  We have footage and articles he's filed.
[06:50.080 --> 06:56.520]  He's going to be joining us via video Skype from Davos, so we did get somebody to Davos.
[06:56.520 --> 06:58.960]  I'm like, who are we going to send?
[06:58.960 --> 07:02.040]  We're down to the wire here, and then like, wait, we have Dan Lyman.
[07:02.040 --> 07:04.040]  He's in Switzerland.
[07:04.040 --> 07:05.920]  So Dan Lyman is going to be joining us.
[07:05.920 --> 07:07.520]  Great reporter coming up.
[07:07.520 --> 07:09.520]  Here's a story from Clifford Cunningham.
[07:09.520 --> 07:15.960]  Cliffard, global order in distress, that's their words at Davos, as Trump passes one
[07:15.960 --> 07:17.080]  year in office.
[07:17.080 --> 07:19.680]  Their authoritarian world government is in big trouble.
[07:19.680 --> 07:22.600]  We'll be talking about that in the third hour today.
[07:22.600 --> 07:29.800]  Now, ladies and gentlemen, here is the big news from DrudgeReport.com.
[07:29.800 --> 07:30.800]  Good one.
[07:30.800 --> 07:36.200]  Evidence suggests massive scandal brewing at the FBI.
[07:36.200 --> 07:43.880]  New York Post, whistleblower, secret society, held offsite meetings, pajamas media, mystery,
[07:43.880 --> 07:51.160]  five months of missing messages, the Hill, agent texted about deleting text.
[07:51.160 --> 07:52.160]  That would be absconding.
[07:52.160 --> 07:53.160]  That would be obstruction.
[07:53.160 --> 07:55.920]  That would be racketeering, and if indeed that's true.
[07:55.920 --> 08:06.160]  Threats of violence, Infowars.com, knives out for the bureau, poll, 58% think FBI hiding,
[08:06.160 --> 08:07.160]  something.
[08:07.160 --> 08:12.360]  And that's with one of those skewed partisan polls, more like 70%, obviously, have IQs
[08:12.360 --> 08:15.640]  above 70% and understand what's going on here.
[08:15.640 --> 08:21.920]  The entire House of Cards fell a month and a week ago, about five weeks ago, when those
[08:21.920 --> 08:29.960]  text messages began to come out of colluding and secretly meeting and meeting with McCabe,
[08:29.960 --> 08:37.720]  and then drip, drip, drip, the next week, oh, and you are setting up an insurance policy
[08:37.720 --> 08:44.240]  to stop the president-elect, oh, and then you're talking about deleting text messages,
[08:44.240 --> 08:49.400]  and there's secret societies, and you're talking about, you need to take this piece
[08:49.400 --> 08:53.840]  of crap out.
[08:53.840 --> 08:58.960]  That is all beginning to come to the surface, and they're in full panic mode.
[08:58.960 --> 09:07.760]  When you've got Nunez's memo, the four pages, on the secret FISA court rulings on the spying
[09:07.760 --> 09:12.840]  on Trump that shows, from the congressional sources and others that I've talked to, and
[09:12.840 --> 09:17.520]  that Jack Vasovic's talked to, and that Roger Stone's talked to, that clearly shows them
[09:17.520 --> 09:23.280]  lying to Congress when they said that Obama and others weren't involved getting the FISA
[09:23.280 --> 09:32.480]  memo and getting the FISA ruling for the wiretaps that they did after they were already spying
[09:32.480 --> 09:37.600]  on the president, and the media has successfully confused people, as usual, William Benny headed
[09:37.600 --> 09:41.200]  up the National Security Agency in operations.
[09:41.200 --> 09:44.200]  I was already going to get into our sources and what is in the memo and what was going
[09:44.200 --> 09:48.600]  to next come out, then he sends us this, and he says to his knowledge, he was just pointed
[09:48.600 --> 09:54.880]  out to him yesterday, this had just come out, and it is, memorandum, opinion and order,
[09:54.880 --> 10:01.680]  top secret, United States Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, and is the 99-page document
[10:01.680 --> 10:06.920]  that is the two-year history of this, but about 10% is blacked out, and Nunez is talking
[10:06.920 --> 10:12.960]  about the secret sections of the FISA memo, but no one had ever reported on this except
[10:12.960 --> 10:18.320]  for a press release when it first came out, so it was new yesterday because it was getting
[10:18.320 --> 10:19.320]  attention.
[10:19.320 --> 10:23.640]  It's like if you found what a dinosaur fell down 25 million years ago and died, but you
[10:23.640 --> 10:27.960]  find it skull while you're digging with a backhoe in your backyard, you just discovered
[10:27.960 --> 10:30.280]  the T-Rex.
[10:30.280 --> 10:35.800]  The media totally ignored it and said, oh, it's old news, and didn't even point out it's
[10:35.800 --> 10:43.360]  the main memo that Nunez is talking about having damning information that's still classified.
[10:43.360 --> 10:47.560]  So think about that, it's the classic thing with, these aren't the droids you're looking
[10:47.560 --> 10:54.560]  for, move along, move along, when they're driving into Los Isles spaceport, and these
[10:54.560 --> 10:57.440]  aren't the droids you're looking for, these aren't the droids you're looking for, and
[10:57.440 --> 10:59.520]  just move along, move along.
[10:59.520 --> 11:05.360]  This is as big as the WikiLeaks ever was about the illegal spying, totally bombshell.
[11:05.360 --> 11:10.120]  The FISA court pushes back and says it's illegal, what's happening to the president?
[11:10.120 --> 11:12.680]  President-elect and then candidate Trump.
[11:12.680 --> 11:17.160]  You think that's big news, oh, just that's Alex Jones, that's old news, just, you know,
[11:17.160 --> 11:19.280]  move along, move along, nothing there.
[11:19.280 --> 11:22.840]  That's the same crazy guy that tells you, you know, the televisions and smart phones
[11:22.840 --> 11:25.960]  have embedded microphones and cameras that are watching you, and then, of course, decades
[11:25.960 --> 11:26.960]  later they admit it.
[11:26.960 --> 11:32.680]  So, getting into the big news here, report missing FBI text messages include threats
[11:32.680 --> 11:43.040]  of violence against Trump, Paul Joseph Watson article, then he gets in to where Phil Mudd,
[11:43.040 --> 11:48.600]  the head of counterterrorism from the FBI, formerly under Mueller, formerly also at the
[11:48.600 --> 11:55.760]  CIA as the head of counterterrorism, brought over by Obama to the FBI, saying on TV, we're
[11:55.760 --> 12:02.240]  going to kill the president, and hashtag Hunt Republicans, and all this endless violence
[12:02.240 --> 12:06.360]  talk and trying to target Scalise and the Republican leadership.
[12:06.360 --> 12:10.640]  We actually have Republican freedom caucus individuals and people like Rand Paul and
[12:10.640 --> 12:15.920]  others in Scalise that are standing up to deep state, that are trying to restore the
[12:15.920 --> 12:22.480]  Republic, that do have honor, and they've been shot at.
[12:22.480 --> 12:28.760]  And I'll never forget, Will Blitzer had a friend on the man that shot those people at
[12:28.760 --> 12:35.920]  the baseball practice, and the friend said, he's not a bad man, he's not a killer, he's
[12:35.920 --> 12:39.720]  not a psycho, he was standing up against politics that are evil.
[12:39.720 --> 12:45.800]  And Will Blitzer nods his head and says, thank you, that's who they are, trying to get crazy
[12:45.800 --> 12:47.600]  people to go out and do this.
[12:47.600 --> 12:53.320]  They're just seeing in, pushing us, claim GOP shooter, wasn't evil, infowars.com.
[12:53.320 --> 12:57.720]  So Paul has all that linked in the article, of course they're in private messages.
[12:57.720 --> 13:03.800]  If they're on TV saying, the government's going to kill Trump, that's bold.
[13:03.800 --> 13:06.880]  You know they're doing it in private, and that's reportedly what's going on.
[13:06.880 --> 13:07.880]  That's on drudgerport.com.
[13:07.880 --> 13:08.880]  We're going to cover it.
[13:08.880 --> 13:14.640]  Let's get to this clip here, Senator Ron Johnson on alleged secret society.
[13:14.640 --> 13:18.000]  They were holding secret meetings off site, that's a fact.
[13:18.000 --> 13:23.920]  They call it a secret society, because that's what a secret group inside a group is, is
[13:23.920 --> 13:29.880]  a clique, a cabal, a conspiracy.
[13:29.880 --> 13:34.320]  So here is the senator breaking down these bombshell developments.
[13:34.320 --> 13:40.360]  What this is all about is further evidence of corruption, more than bias, but corruption
[13:40.360 --> 13:43.720]  at the highest levels of the FBI in that secret society.
[13:43.720 --> 13:48.120]  We have an informant that's talking about a group that were holding secret meetings
[13:48.120 --> 13:50.120]  off site.
[13:50.120 --> 13:52.480]  There's so much smoke here, there's so much suspicion.
[13:52.480 --> 13:53.480]  Let's stop there.
[13:53.480 --> 13:58.120]  A secret society, secret meetings off site of the Justice Department.
[13:58.120 --> 14:00.240]  And you have an informant saying that.
[14:00.240 --> 14:01.240]  Yes.
[14:01.240 --> 14:03.040]  Is there anything more about that?
[14:03.040 --> 14:04.040]  No.
[14:04.040 --> 14:05.040]  Let me do it.
[14:05.040 --> 14:07.040]  That's, that's, this is not a distraction.
[14:07.040 --> 14:12.240]  Again, this is, this is bias, potentially corruption at the highest levels of the FBI
[14:12.240 --> 14:16.680]  that is now investigating and now there's, and by the way, Robert Mueller used to run
[14:16.680 --> 14:18.520]  the FBI.
[14:18.520 --> 14:23.000]  He is in no position to do an investigation over this kind of misconduct.
[14:23.000 --> 14:26.440]  So I think at this point in time, we probably should be looking at a special counsel to
[14:26.440 --> 14:30.280]  undertake this investigation, but Congress is going to have to continue to dig.
[14:30.280 --> 14:31.280]  Yeah.
[14:31.280 --> 14:33.560]  That's not enough to then play political football.
[14:33.560 --> 14:37.120]  We need grand juries to start indicting these FBI agents now.
[14:37.120 --> 14:41.200]  They obviously have good FBI agents and others that were witness to all this.
[14:41.200 --> 14:46.200]  And a lot of them obviously have copies of the text that are now going to Congress.
[14:46.200 --> 14:51.400]  We have reached the most dangerous point in this country's history, in my opinion right
[14:51.400 --> 15:01.000]  now, because we have a serious embedded criminal cabal, a La Cosa Nostra, our thing.
[15:01.000 --> 15:04.920]  It's not an Italian conspiracy, but it's the same thing.
[15:04.920 --> 15:11.160]  A secret society, our little thing of less than 30 FBI agents and Justice Department
[15:11.160 --> 15:15.960]  people at the top that were so arrogant and so crazy, they thought they could get away
[15:15.960 --> 15:20.440]  with saying the American people are Russian agents and Russia runs everything and Facebook
[15:20.440 --> 15:22.360]  is banning people by the thousands an hour.
[15:22.360 --> 15:23.560]  It's all over the news.
[15:23.560 --> 15:25.840]  Paul Watson's coming up about it.
[15:25.840 --> 15:27.680]  First they said, notice is saying, you're a Russian bot.
[15:27.680 --> 15:28.680]  We have evidence.
[15:28.680 --> 15:29.680]  People go, what?
[15:29.680 --> 15:34.400]  Yeah, don't criticize any Democrats or your band and then they ban you as a Russian agent.
[15:34.400 --> 15:37.720]  That's beyond book burning, beyond McCarthyism.
[15:37.720 --> 15:38.720]  And it's happening.
[15:38.720 --> 15:42.040]  They're making their move like they're not giving up.
[15:42.040 --> 15:49.520]  So as far as I'm concerned, the safest thing to do would just to be have Trump just go
[15:49.520 --> 15:52.200]  ahead and have the army go ahead and arrest these people.
[15:52.200 --> 15:53.200]  That's all.
[15:53.200 --> 15:54.200]  And we're in a red alert right now.
[15:54.200 --> 15:58.200]  We had to have the army just to arrest these people.
[15:58.200 --> 15:59.880]  Fully cooked, ready to eat bacon.
[15:59.880 --> 16:04.680]  I'm talking thick meaty, center cut, presidential bacon, savory and delicious.
[16:04.680 --> 16:05.680]  I buy some.
[16:05.680 --> 16:06.680]  I use some.
[16:06.680 --> 16:07.680]  I store some.

[18:12.160 --> 18:16.520]  Mexico where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade grown Arabica beans.
[18:16.520 --> 18:21.840]  We have now managed to secure these sought after beans in a highly customized blend.

[20:01.600 --> 20:20.640]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[20:20.640 --> 20:37.760]  A lot of people that have been listening to the show for 20 years, they go, Alex, in
[20:37.760 --> 20:44.960]  the last segment you just called for the president, if need be, to use the armed services to
[20:44.960 --> 20:51.360]  arrest the leaders of a criminal cabal openly plotting the president's assassination, the
[20:51.360 --> 20:57.560]  overthrow of our electoral process, the takeover of our elections and a one party system to
[20:57.560 --> 21:05.280]  be formed where all political dissent against the leftist globalist Soros program is outlawed.
[21:05.280 --> 21:10.400]  And yes, that is the only sure, strong response.
[21:10.400 --> 21:15.920]  And then once that group has been removed within the Constitution and Bill of Rights,
[21:15.920 --> 21:18.360]  we will revert right back to the rule of law.
[21:18.360 --> 21:24.240]  But there is COG provisions, and I guarantee you George Washington, if stuff like this
[21:24.240 --> 21:28.960]  was going on, would go arrest the people that were doing it because they're not trying
[21:28.960 --> 21:29.960]  to get elected.
[21:29.960 --> 21:32.600]  They're not trying to change laws or win in court.
[21:32.600 --> 21:39.200]  They are plotting inside the government to defraud voters, call all the voters agents
[21:39.200 --> 21:48.800]  of a foreign power, intimidate them, arrest them, threaten them, censor them, sabotage
[21:48.800 --> 21:53.200]  the recovery of the economy.
[21:53.200 --> 21:58.120]  And it just goes on and on from there.
[21:58.120 --> 22:02.960]  And it's extremely frustrating to watch this happen and hear about a special council that's
[22:02.960 --> 22:08.160]  going to deal with it maybe, and then they just cover up what goes on over and over again.
[22:08.160 --> 22:11.640]  Remember we need grand juries, state and federal, to start indicting these people.
[22:11.640 --> 22:14.640]  That's another way to do it from the grassroots.
[22:14.640 --> 22:19.560]  But you've got them in their text messages, it's now coming out from Congress, saying,
[22:19.560 --> 22:23.320]  we erased most of the text, don't worry.
[22:23.320 --> 22:27.040]  And the informants that have come forward have said, it's secret societies, they're meeting
[22:27.040 --> 22:33.140]  off site, they're plotting violence against the president, and I can turn on the former
[22:33.140 --> 22:37.400]  head of counterterrorism, as the people that send out the teams to kill people, send out
[22:37.400 --> 22:42.040]  the Navy SEALs and everybody, saying we're going to kill the president, and you already
[22:42.040 --> 22:46.200]  had the Democrats attack the Republican leadership at the baseball game and try to decapitate
[22:46.200 --> 22:53.000]  it with the New York Times writing a blueprint on where they are and that there's no security.
[22:53.000 --> 22:56.400]  I mean, this is incredible what's going on.
[22:56.400 --> 23:00.160]  So they're on television saying they're going to kill our president, they're going to have
[23:00.160 --> 23:05.200]  Homeland Security under their control, federalize all 50 states and federalize elections and
[23:05.200 --> 23:10.720]  let illegal aliens vote, overthrow the country completely, and then arrest conservatives,
[23:10.720 --> 23:12.560]  libertarians, Christians, you name it.
[23:12.560 --> 23:13.560]  They've announced it.
[23:13.560 --> 23:19.080]  And you go to rallies in Austin, L.A., New York, almost every person we talked to said,
[23:19.080 --> 23:22.480]  we're getting guillotines ready, we're going to kill conservatives, we're going to kill
[23:22.480 --> 23:24.560]  Trump and his family, we're going to kill you.
[23:24.560 --> 23:28.800]  In fact, I'll play that next segment, I never got to that yesterday.
[23:28.800 --> 23:32.160]  And they're all nodding, we're going to kill the conservatives and the Christians, we're
[23:32.160 --> 23:36.040]  going to kill them and these are marches with hundreds of thousands of people not in their
[23:36.040 --> 23:39.360]  head, we're going to kill you.
[23:39.360 --> 23:47.020]  Now they're obviously not going to kill anybody, but they are on board for it.
[23:47.020 --> 23:48.920]  They are scum of the earth.
[23:48.920 --> 23:55.000]  We have hardcore real authoritarianism here that wants to overthrow the country and that
[23:55.000 --> 23:58.800]  wants to arrest and torture and kill its opposition.
[23:58.800 --> 24:03.120]  Yeah, that guy was just screaming FU and spitting on us and everything.
[24:03.120 --> 24:06.320]  I'm going to play the women saying they want to, they're going to guillotine everybody
[24:06.320 --> 24:10.400]  and have a communist utopia when we come back.
[24:10.400 --> 24:16.320]  So understand if you just tuned in, all I'm saying is this is the climate we've now reached
[24:16.320 --> 24:20.160]  where we have to have serious discussions about what are we going to do if they kill
[24:20.160 --> 24:25.160]  the president and then order their local governments and their local federal branches
[24:25.160 --> 24:30.000]  to come arrest thousands of resistance leaders because we are the resistance to the foreign
[24:30.000 --> 24:32.600]  mega banks that took the country over.
[24:32.600 --> 24:39.000]  We are the resistance to globalism, communism, socialism, you know, the godless heathen that
[24:39.000 --> 24:42.280]  want to ban Christianity, that want to bring in radical Islam.
[24:42.280 --> 24:47.640]  We are the resistance to the overthrow of the West and we are legitimately trying to
[24:47.640 --> 24:51.920]  have prosperity, legitimately trying to have free open societies, legitimately trying to
[24:51.920 --> 24:54.000]  be tolerant.
[24:54.000 --> 24:56.240]  Everybody knows I'm a libertarian, Trump's a libertarian.
[24:56.240 --> 24:58.120]  We are very tolerant, open people.
[24:58.120 --> 24:59.600]  We are good people.
[24:59.600 --> 25:00.600]  I am a good person.
[25:00.600 --> 25:03.680]  I care about everybody, no matter what color you are, where you came from, if you want
[25:03.680 --> 25:05.920]  to be a hardworking good person, I love you.
[25:05.920 --> 25:10.560]  I want prosperity and they have congressional hearings saying censor me, shut me up, I'm
[25:10.560 --> 25:11.880]  a Russian agent.
[25:11.880 --> 25:14.280]  That's those are the dangerous enemies, folks.
[25:14.280 --> 25:15.840]  They're the ones starting all this.
[25:15.840 --> 25:18.400]  They want to arrest everybody.
[25:18.400 --> 25:19.720]  That's what Hitler did.
[25:19.720 --> 25:21.080]  That's what Stalin did.
[25:21.080 --> 25:22.360]  That's what Lenin did.
[25:22.360 --> 25:23.600]  That's what Mao did.
[25:23.600 --> 25:25.280]  That's what Videl Castro did.
[25:25.280 --> 25:28.320]  That's what Hugo Chavez did.
[25:28.320 --> 25:31.320]  And it always leads to total collapse.
[25:31.320 --> 25:34.520]  They get contained in their own command and control country and it falls apart within
[25:34.520 --> 25:42.280]  a decade or they start attacking their neighbors and people organize and kick the tyrants butts.
[25:42.280 --> 25:49.000]  And Peter Schiff and Dianne Feinstein and all these people are sick, evil authoritarians
[25:49.000 --> 25:53.560]  that have had their hands around this country's throat, holding our economy underwater.
[25:53.560 --> 25:56.120]  For too long.
[25:56.120 --> 26:01.960]  And they want to bring in authoritarianism and have staged elections.
[26:01.960 --> 26:07.920]  All 50 attorney generals, including 20-something Democrats wrote letters last year to Obama
[26:07.920 --> 26:11.840]  and then to Trump saying please reverse the executive orders and laws federalizing the
[26:11.840 --> 26:13.960]  election.
[26:13.960 --> 26:17.040]  Something Trump hasn't done yet, by the way, even though he was critical of what Obama
[26:17.040 --> 26:20.680]  did in the 11th hour.
[26:20.680 --> 26:25.360]  And you've got Newsweek saying Russian bots might be behind hashtag release the memo.
[26:25.360 --> 26:26.360]  Oh, see?
[26:26.360 --> 26:34.760]  Oh, and I bet Russian bots are behind the memo, too, itself, that is a boil down of
[26:34.760 --> 26:40.120]  what's in the classified areas of the FISA memorandum that no one gave any attention
[26:40.120 --> 26:41.640]  till we put it up yesterday.
[26:41.640 --> 26:46.160]  And we said Nunes has got his own memo with this and a blueprint coming out, but this is
[26:46.160 --> 26:49.240]  a big chunk of it and the media spun that misdirected.
[26:49.240 --> 26:53.440]  These aren't the droids you're looking for.
[26:53.440 --> 26:54.440]  Move along.
[26:54.440 --> 27:00.520]  Just like the Hill is reporting that Trump blamed Samsung for deleting 50,000 emails.
[27:00.520 --> 27:03.800]  Trump said that these corrupt agents had deleted them.
[27:03.800 --> 27:09.600]  We have witnesses and they invert reality and go look, Trump blamed Samsung.
[27:09.600 --> 27:14.880]  Remember how they all made it about who broke in and got the WikiLeaks of Podesta instead
[27:14.880 --> 27:16.640]  of what did Podesta do?
[27:16.640 --> 27:22.120]  Just in, Trump blamed Samsung for missing text messages between FBI agents critical of Trump.
[27:22.120 --> 27:23.120]  The Hill.
[27:23.120 --> 27:24.120]  There's this tweet.
[27:24.120 --> 27:27.880]  Where are the 50,000 important text messages between the FBI?
[27:27.880 --> 27:35.880]  Lovers, Lisa Page and Peter Strock blaming Samsung, yes, they blame Samsung saying it
[27:35.880 --> 27:36.880]  must be an accident.
[27:36.880 --> 27:38.040]  No, they did.
[27:38.040 --> 27:42.960]  That Samsung hardcodes it, but again, these aren't the droids you're looking for.
[27:42.960 --> 27:43.960]  Play the clip.
[27:43.960 --> 27:49.680]  Let me see your identification, you don't need to see his identification.
[27:49.680 --> 27:51.240]  We don't need to see his identification.
[27:51.240 --> 27:53.240]  These aren't the droids you're looking for.
[27:53.240 --> 27:56.840]  These aren't the droids we're looking for.
[27:56.840 --> 27:57.840]  He can go about his business.
[27:57.840 --> 27:58.840]  You can go about your business.
[27:58.840 --> 27:59.840]  Move along.
[27:59.840 --> 28:00.840]  Move along.
[28:00.840 --> 28:01.840]  Move along.
[28:01.840 --> 28:17.080]  And here it is right here, folks.
[28:17.080 --> 28:18.960]  These aren't the droids you're looking for.
[28:18.960 --> 28:25.840]  Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court memorandum opinion and order declassified.
[28:25.840 --> 28:30.080]  And then Nunes has got the blacked out parts that he says are even more damning and the
[28:30.080 --> 28:31.840]  media just says, oh, that's old news.
[28:31.840 --> 28:32.960]  Don't look at it.
[28:32.960 --> 28:35.120]  These aren't the droids you're looking for.
[28:35.120 --> 28:36.120]  Move along.
[28:36.120 --> 28:40.080]  Doesn't matter what William Benny says, he just used to run the NSA.
[28:40.080 --> 28:41.080]  He's a moron.
[28:41.080 --> 28:44.560]  According to them, CNN, they know everything.
[28:44.560 --> 28:45.560]  Media matters.
[28:45.560 --> 28:46.560]  Run by George Soros.
[28:46.560 --> 28:48.600]  They said that it's not even real.
[28:48.600 --> 28:50.200]  Well, yes, sir.
[28:50.200 --> 28:51.200]  Mr. Soros, sir.
[28:51.200 --> 28:55.320]  Oh, and CNN says he was never a Nazi collaborator, even though he wrote a book admitting it
[28:55.320 --> 28:58.560]  and was on TV singing.
[28:58.560 --> 28:59.560]  This is Dan Billard.
[28:59.560 --> 29:02.680]  The IRS money you can't pay are tax debts crippling you.
[29:02.680 --> 29:05.480]  I've defended people from the IRS for over 30 years.

[29:11.720 --> 29:12.720]  case.
[29:12.720 --> 29:16.400]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX to finally get free of IRS debt.

[30:19.240 --> 30:23.320]  auto-ship because we hold back a surplus for auto-ship customers.
[30:23.320 --> 30:28.840]  Number three, we're giving you free shipping on all orders above $50, listeners have been

[30:58.840 --> 31:02.400]  InfoWare's Life is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine.
[31:02.400 --> 31:07.160]  We have found an extraordinary new natural way to help alleviate seasonal distress symptoms,
[31:07.160 --> 31:12.520]  including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort and respiratory health
[31:12.520 --> 31:13.920]  and normal breathing.
[31:13.920 --> 31:14.920]  This is pollen block.
[31:14.920 --> 31:20.280]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs from
[31:20.280 --> 31:26.320]  specific farms experienced less seasonal distress symptoms like runny nose, itchy watery eyes
[31:26.320 --> 31:32.760]  and excessive mucus production, they began studying the effects in their public trials.
[31:32.760 --> 31:38.920]  Now we are introducing the fruit of the research, a fast-acting chewable tablet, just two tablets
[31:38.920 --> 31:43.720]  at the first sign of seasonal distress, and fast-acting pollen block starts working in
[31:43.720 --> 31:47.480]  about 15 minutes to help alleviate seasonal distress.
[31:47.480 --> 31:53.800]  Enjoy the air you breathe naturally with fast-acting pollen block, available now at infowarslife.com
[31:53.800 --> 31:58.720]  or by calling toll 3, triple A 253-3139.
[31:58.720 --> 32:00.800]  Frank in North Carolina, thanks for holding so long.
[32:00.800 --> 32:01.800]  Go ahead.
[32:01.800 --> 32:06.160]  Well, I just have to say something, man, it seems like every time I turn on your broadcast,
[32:06.160 --> 32:07.160]  you're bragging.
[32:07.160 --> 32:08.160]  It just gets old, man.
[32:08.160 --> 32:11.440]  I'm going to shut you down right now, okay?
[32:11.440 --> 32:13.680]  We're taking calls about your nomination.
[32:13.680 --> 32:18.240]  Do you understand they're having congressional hearings trying to shut us down?
[32:18.240 --> 32:20.320]  Do you understand I'm ringing the alarm?
[32:20.320 --> 32:23.560]  If that was happening to anybody else, I'd be freaked out.
[32:23.560 --> 32:26.120]  I mean, what's it going to take, us being shut down?
[32:26.120 --> 32:27.120]  Is that what you want, Frank?
[32:27.120 --> 32:28.120]  Yeah, you know what?
[32:28.120 --> 32:29.120]  I'll take it.
[32:29.120 --> 32:30.120]  Put him on pause again.
[32:30.120 --> 32:31.120]  Hey, Frank!
[32:31.120 --> 32:35.640]  Do you understand it's not bragging to say, we are the tip of the spear, we're under attack,
[32:35.640 --> 32:36.640]  we need your help?
[32:36.640 --> 32:40.960]  As much begging as I do, we can barely pay the bills and grow in the face of this.
[32:40.960 --> 32:43.920]  I'm not going to just stop growth and let them start pushing us backwards.
[32:43.920 --> 32:44.920]  Do you understand?
[32:44.920 --> 32:46.160]  I need your help, Frank!
[32:46.160 --> 32:48.440]  I need your help, Frank!
[32:48.440 --> 32:53.440]  Go to infowarstore.com right now and help fund the info.
[32:53.440 --> 32:54.720]  Do you understand?
[32:54.720 --> 32:56.400]  I need your help, Frank!
[32:56.400 --> 33:03.400]  Free press needs your help, Frank!
[33:26.400 --> 33:36.280]  Our country is already in a civil emergency.
[33:36.280 --> 33:42.200]  The Democrats, CNN, MSNBC, Democrats in Congress, they're already calling in a civil emergency.
[33:42.200 --> 33:47.520]  They're already calling for the president to be removed and martial law declared.
[33:47.520 --> 33:51.880]  Documents came out a few weeks ago from the whole Soros operation, trying to trigger martial
[33:51.880 --> 33:55.440]  law back in 2015, causing a race war.
[33:55.440 --> 34:01.080]  They failed, but now we learn about criminal cabals, organizing lies to blame not just
[34:01.080 --> 34:05.200]  the president but the American people for being Russian agents, to then try to overthrow
[34:05.200 --> 34:11.120]  the election, hold the new national election that under Obama's executive order will be
[34:11.120 --> 34:13.000]  controlled by Homeland Security.
[34:13.000 --> 34:16.120]  We'll never have a real election again.
[34:16.120 --> 34:19.720]  They're trying to bring in a permanent, deep state dictatorship.
[34:19.720 --> 34:26.480]  So, if there aren't instant indictments by grand juries with these open and shut tases
[34:26.480 --> 34:34.120]  against the Clinton cabal inside the FBI, if we don't see grand juries take action immediately,
[34:34.120 --> 34:35.120]  what are we supposed to do?
[34:35.120 --> 34:39.960]  Sit here and wait for them because dredgerport.com has the infowarstore.com report that Paul
[34:39.960 --> 34:44.480]  Watson's about to break down.
[34:44.480 --> 34:48.400]  Missing FBI text messages include threats of violence against Trump.
[34:48.400 --> 34:54.000]  And then Paul links to all the times the Democrats are saying, let's kill the president, let's
[34:54.000 --> 34:59.360]  go out and shoot up their baseball games, hashtag hunt Republicans.
[34:59.360 --> 35:08.120]  So, Paul Watson joins us to talk about this, but the question is, we're already in a civil
[35:08.120 --> 35:09.120]  emergency.
[35:09.120 --> 35:15.440]  I don't want that to see another branch of the government working with the states go
[35:15.440 --> 35:20.760]  arrest the Democrat Party leadership because when you tend to go into these type of third
[35:20.760 --> 35:28.760]  world crises historically, the group stopping one coup becomes its own coup.
[35:28.760 --> 35:33.200]  But when you're faced with the real coup, what do you do?
[35:33.200 --> 35:38.080]  So Paul Joseph Watson joins us from London, England to give us his latest take on all
[35:38.080 --> 35:40.920]  of these incredible revelations.
[35:40.920 --> 35:43.120]  I mean, is the House of Cards falling?
[35:43.120 --> 35:50.480]  And dredgerport has the headline, you know, FBI collision course as the wheels completely
[35:50.480 --> 35:57.520]  go off, collision course, Congress tightening noose on investigation, well, I mean, it's
[35:57.520 --> 36:03.880]  not just the investigation, it's the bold, crazy fraud of what they tried, Paul, just
[36:03.880 --> 36:08.640]  like you got letters from Twitter saying, we may ban you, you're a Russian agent.
[36:08.640 --> 36:12.200]  And what hundreds of thousands of other people and now I'm told today they're deleting the
[36:12.200 --> 36:15.480]  accounts saying we're all Russian agents.
[36:15.480 --> 36:20.760]  I mean, this is an incredible attempted takeover by the multinational globalist who are the
[36:20.760 --> 36:23.200]  outside power that have hijacked our country.
[36:23.200 --> 36:24.200]  We try to take it back.
[36:24.200 --> 36:28.720]  You try to take yours back with Briggs and they say that the Briggs run by the Russians.
[36:28.720 --> 36:29.720]  This is incredible.
[36:29.720 --> 36:32.760]  Paul Watson, what point in history are we at right now?
[36:32.760 --> 36:36.400]  Well, we're at a monumental point in history, Alex.
[36:36.400 --> 36:39.040]  And you can tell that because they're panicking so much.
[36:39.040 --> 36:43.000]  You can see it in Davos where it's, you know, Merkel and the Prime Minister of India panicking
[36:43.000 --> 36:48.360]  that popular populism is on the rise, they're contriving fake moral panics about the post
[36:48.360 --> 36:53.360]  truth world and fake news, which are again, just an excuse to distract from the fact that
[36:53.360 --> 36:58.360]  they're losing control of the narrative, they're losing the power to manufacture consent.
[36:58.360 --> 37:02.720]  So they have to come up with all these reasons as to why that's not really happening.
[37:02.720 --> 37:09.120]  And it's really the evil Russians and the, you know, the people in America who voted
[37:09.120 --> 37:14.080]  for Trump, the deplorables, but with this new development, Alex and the articles upon
[37:14.080 --> 37:19.000]  drudges, he said, they really are panicking because it seems as though after Peter Strock
[37:19.000 --> 37:24.360]  got exposed, of course, was the top FBI investigator who said they needed an insurance policy in
[37:24.360 --> 37:25.360]  case Trump won.
[37:25.360 --> 37:30.320]  Of course, some of the messages, the thousands of messages that are missing were his messages.
[37:30.320 --> 37:35.520]  It seemed that the secret society that we're now all talking about started to panic after
[37:35.520 --> 37:40.000]  he got exposed and now apparently they're all using burner phones.
[37:40.000 --> 37:44.880]  So they're all really paranoid about anything they say being exposed because as you probably
[37:44.880 --> 37:49.600]  saw and are going to play later, Congressman Ron Johnson went on Fox News last night and
[37:49.600 --> 37:55.320]  said, they've got a whistleblower who says that they're holding secret meetings offsite.
[37:55.320 --> 38:00.160]  Now isn't that interesting, Alex, and you're all in the clip right now, because the same
[38:00.160 --> 38:06.960]  source that said these text messages contain violent threats against Donald Trump, the
[38:06.960 --> 38:13.080]  same source said that these secret offsite, secret society meetings were taking place
[38:13.080 --> 38:15.600]  a month before it was in the news.
[38:15.600 --> 38:19.680]  So if you want to look at this report and claim that this is fake news or whatever, the source
[38:19.680 --> 38:24.560]  of it was way ahead of this story a month ago, and in fact, more than a month.
[38:24.560 --> 38:29.540]  It's a guy who goes by the Monica Thomas Paine on Twitter, got a huge following, a big
[38:29.540 --> 38:31.400]  intelligence website.
[38:31.400 --> 38:36.760]  He tweeted, bearing in mind that Ron Johnson just revealed this last night on Fox News
[38:36.760 --> 38:40.240]  that this secret society was having offsite meetings.
[38:40.240 --> 38:43.600]  This source tweeted, which is the source of this article that's on Drudge.
[38:43.600 --> 38:49.320]  Well, what I hear about private meeting away from FBI HQ by high ranking FBI agents trying
[38:49.320 --> 38:51.860]  to get their stories and alibi straight.
[38:51.860 --> 38:58.320]  So he's talking about offsite meetings involving FBI top brass a month before it was in the
[38:58.320 --> 39:04.800]  news two and a half months before it was in the news, he's talking about FBI secret societies.
[39:04.800 --> 39:09.960]  So he was blowing the whistle on this from his sources weeks and weeks before it became
[39:09.960 --> 39:11.080]  public.
[39:11.080 --> 39:15.760]  And that is the same source that says some of these missing text messages contain violent
[39:15.760 --> 39:17.820]  threats against President Trump.
[39:17.820 --> 39:23.960]  So he's been right on this very issue of FBI secret societies proven correct a month ago.
[39:23.960 --> 39:28.440]  He foresaw this because he had the intel before even Congress had it.
[39:28.440 --> 39:31.640]  And that's the basis of the story that we're now putting out today.
[39:31.640 --> 39:37.080]  Well, we also have Jim Jordan and others that weeks before info comes out, they say, let
[39:37.080 --> 39:39.480]  me just have a hypothesis here.
[39:39.480 --> 39:43.920]  Let's just say you've got McCabe meeting with Strach and all these other people together
[39:43.920 --> 39:48.280]  and then they use the dossier to go get the fake warrant.
[39:48.280 --> 39:51.760]  And then of course, he already has the documents, he releases them a week later, two weeks later.
[39:51.760 --> 39:57.120]  They're already doing that and they're already telegraphing to our sources that that these
[39:57.120 --> 40:00.640]  people were so stupid, they're even talking about how they deleted text.
[40:00.640 --> 40:01.760]  That's in the news.
[40:01.760 --> 40:04.960]  They're even talking about previously how they're going to stop Trump.
[40:04.960 --> 40:07.520]  And so it's very open and shut.
[40:07.520 --> 40:11.520]  And I guess the Democrats are just going to hold on and force all of this to be brought
[40:11.520 --> 40:12.520]  out.
[40:12.520 --> 40:14.080]  I think we're in a very dangerous point though, Paul.
[40:14.080 --> 40:22.200]  The rats are cornered, the entire Comey, Mueller, Clinton, crime cabal is set to be brought
[40:22.200 --> 40:27.200]  down by FBI agents who are now informing the Congress.
[40:27.200 --> 40:29.000]  I don't see how they get out of this.
[40:29.000 --> 40:34.200]  They push so far trying to remove Trump that you can't just let them go off into abstention
[40:34.200 --> 40:35.200]  now.
[40:35.200 --> 40:36.200]  They've got to be indicted.
[40:36.200 --> 40:38.080]  They've got to go to prison.
[40:38.080 --> 40:39.080]  Exactly.
[40:39.080 --> 40:41.880]  And Republican Congressmen have alluded to that fact.
[40:41.880 --> 40:43.720]  Here's another thing, Alex.
[40:43.720 --> 40:47.240]  You know, people are calling up Adam Schiff saying, oh, I'm not a Russian bot and it's
[40:47.240 --> 40:51.040]  all very funny and everything because, of course, we've seen the Twitter internal analysis.
[40:51.040 --> 40:55.280]  It wasn't Russian bots behind the release, the memo hashtag.
[40:55.280 --> 41:00.320]  People should be calling up Trey Gowdy because Judge Napolitano made this point and nobody
[41:00.320 --> 41:01.880]  else has picked up on it.
[41:01.880 --> 41:08.560]  You can go on the House floor and reveal supposedly classified information and be protected under
[41:08.560 --> 41:14.680]  the Constitution because Dianne Feinstein did it in 2014 with the torture memos.
[41:14.680 --> 41:19.120]  So they will be completely protected if they reveal the details of this four-page Pfizer
[41:19.120 --> 41:22.800]  memo, if they get in front of the House and do it tonight.
[41:22.800 --> 41:27.360]  So why isn't everybody calling Trey Gowdy and all these other Republican Congressmen
[41:27.360 --> 41:28.800]  asking them to do that?
[41:28.800 --> 41:32.080]  I mean, they go on about it being worse than the KGB.
[41:32.080 --> 41:36.520]  If it's really that bad, surely in the interest of the American people, they need to go in
[41:36.520 --> 41:40.680]  front of Congress and reveal the details of it.
[41:40.680 --> 41:49.600]  Paul, this is such an epic time to be alive, edge of our seats, but then first Trump's a
[41:49.600 --> 41:53.280]  Russian, then Drudge is a Russian, then I'm a Russian, then you're a Russian, Roger Stone's
[41:53.280 --> 41:54.280]  a Russian.
[41:54.280 --> 41:59.880]  Now, I was reading, first it was 60,000, now it's 200 plus thousand people have gotten
[41:59.880 --> 42:04.240]  emails from Twitter saying, you're a Russian or you're a Russian bot, and this is really
[42:04.240 --> 42:06.520]  pissing people off.
[42:06.520 --> 42:10.840]  And new Twitter accounts that are just libertarian, Christian, conservative, pro-military, we're
[42:10.840 --> 42:15.960]  all being told we're Russian agents by Peter Schiff, who clearly wants to intimidate us
[42:15.960 --> 42:16.960]  into silence.
[42:16.960 --> 42:18.960]  I mean, how criminal is that?
[42:18.960 --> 42:23.280]  Well, it's not only criminal, it's dangerous for the world.
[42:23.280 --> 42:25.720]  I mean, look at what's happening globally, Alex.
[42:25.720 --> 42:30.520]  Sweden and Estonia are sending out pamphlets to all their citizens, millions of people
[42:30.520 --> 42:32.920]  saying, prepare for war.
[42:32.920 --> 42:36.840]  This has made war with Russia infinitely more close, whereas, you know, and originally
[42:36.840 --> 42:39.200]  Trump was looking at a proper reset.
[42:39.200 --> 42:43.640]  This is endangering the planet, because it's actually causing Trump to be more hawkish
[42:43.640 --> 42:47.160]  towards Russia, just to prove he's not a Russian agent.
[42:47.160 --> 42:49.740]  So now what, you know, we're selling weapons to Ukraine.
[42:49.740 --> 42:54.040]  This is causing massive deep stabilization across the world, and that's the bigger issue,
[42:54.040 --> 42:56.520]  I think, than just conspiracy theories about us being Russian agents.
[42:56.520 --> 42:58.640]  Let's talk about that when we come back.
[42:58.640 --> 43:04.960]  I'm so excited, the new product at m4warslife.com, in a glass bottle, two-month servings filled
[43:04.960 --> 43:09.800]  to the brim, filled to the absolute top, the real red pill.
[43:09.800 --> 43:15.240]  This is a heart and brain pill, a new tropic, but it doesn't have any stimulants in it.
[43:15.240 --> 43:18.200]  But boy, does it stimulate, because it's beyond that.
[43:18.200 --> 43:24.240]  Quite frankly, I just went off what I saw medical doctors prescribing to their patients,
[43:24.240 --> 43:30.840]  but it wasn't prescription, but they were charging people $100, $200 for the formulae,
[43:30.840 --> 43:35.920]  and I came up with our own formulae, working with scientists and developers, non-GMO, made
[43:35.920 --> 43:41.760]  right here in America, 120 capsules, and ladies and gentlemen, you add the preglonone to
[43:41.760 --> 43:47.000]  it, which is the precursor to all the hormones that your body has to have to even make the
[43:47.000 --> 43:48.720]  hormones in your glands.
[43:48.720 --> 43:51.480]  It is amazing.
[43:51.480 --> 44:00.240]  Red pill, now available at m4warsstore.com, and your purchase of the operation.
[44:00.240 --> 44:04.280]  Over a year in the making, produced by one of the top organic firms in the country, that
[44:04.280 --> 44:08.920]  if you want proven studies and documentation, I'm going to speak for hours, just on the
[44:08.920 --> 44:13.480]  files I have here, of what this is proven to do, the ingredients in this.
[44:13.480 --> 44:18.640]  This is the ultimate immune system boost for this time of year, any time of the year,
[44:18.640 --> 44:24.840]  immune wall is incredible, and folks, other formulas that aren't even as good are $70-80.
[44:24.840 --> 44:26.400]  It's a great deal at $39.
[44:26.400 --> 44:32.520]  Immune wall, beta-glucans, olive leaf, and so much more, it is concentrated, you need
[44:32.520 --> 44:34.120]  to go read what is in here.
[44:34.120 --> 44:39.080]  The mushroom blend of the most expensive, highest quality mushrooms that just incredibly
[44:39.080 --> 44:40.080]  accelerate.
[44:40.080 --> 44:43.120]  A citrus peel blend, I mean, this is the next level.
[44:43.120 --> 44:47.280]  It's now available, ladies and gentlemen, immune wall, I think it's beyond seasonal.
[44:47.280 --> 44:52.560]  Quick-glucan, olive leaf, and more, immune wall, infowarsstore.com, infowarslive.com,
[44:52.560 --> 44:58.960]  or triple-eight, 253-3139.
[44:58.960 --> 45:05.280]  I want to plow into all of this, but I'm going to spend a few minutes here first, just encouraging
[45:05.280 --> 45:10.800]  listeners to understand that when you buy t-shirts, or water filtration systems, or
[45:10.800 --> 45:18.920]  books, or videos, or other material from infowarsstore.com, you are funding the revolution.
[45:18.920 --> 45:23.840]  I mean, I cannot say it any clear, and so it is essential that you purchase the products
[45:23.840 --> 45:24.840]  at infowarsstore.com.
[45:24.840 --> 45:28.520]  I don't want to thank everybody that has, but we've got the best fluoride-free toothpaste
[45:28.520 --> 45:33.680]  with colloidal silver and with high-quality atomic iodine, and you cannot beat that for
[45:33.680 --> 45:34.680]  children and adults.
[45:34.680 --> 45:38.880]  We've got the best mouthwash designed by Dr. Jones, that's my dad, with colloidal silver
[45:38.880 --> 45:40.400]  and iodine as well.
[45:40.400 --> 45:46.840]  Infowarslive.com, or triple-eight, 253-3139, and your purchase of the products stands with
[45:46.840 --> 45:50.760]  us, stands with America, stands with Trump, stands against the globalists and their satanic
[45:50.760 --> 45:54.560]  pedophile armies, and that's who they are, and they know we know who they are, and they're
[45:54.560 --> 45:59.760]  coming back against us, so we need your support.
[45:59.760 --> 46:04.500]  Introducing Fluorolive, the new probiotic line developed exclusively by Infowarslive.
[46:04.500 --> 46:09.640]  After years of research on the human microbiome, not all probiotics are made the same.
[46:09.640 --> 46:13.840]  Fluorolive probiotics use a unique targeted delivery system that bypasses the stomach
[46:13.840 --> 46:17.960]  and releases directly into the intestines for maximum effect.
[46:17.960 --> 46:22.440]  This is critical because stomach acid kills most probiotics, so if you don't have a targeted
[46:22.440 --> 46:27.040]  delivery probiotic, then you're cheating your gut health and your wallet.
[46:27.040 --> 46:31.480]  Fluorolive supports your body's core, where you need it most, including digestion, regularity,
[46:31.480 --> 46:33.960]  immunity, the gut lining, and metabolism.
[46:33.960 --> 46:38.040]  Did you know that over 80% of your immune system is located in your gut?
[46:38.040 --> 46:42.880]  That's why increasing gut probiotic levels is so important for overall health.
[46:42.880 --> 46:47.320]  Fluorolive is sold as a 15-billion probiotic for everyday maintenance care and a 50-billion
[46:47.320 --> 46:50.680]  probiotic for a 30-day advanced gut restoration program.
[46:50.680 --> 46:54.920]  Head to Infowarslive.com to pick up your bottle of Fluorolive probiotics today.
[46:54.920 --> 47:24.760]  That's Infowarslive.com.
[47:24.920 --> 47:30.160]  I'm Alex Jones, your host, Paul Watson is my guest.
[47:30.160 --> 47:36.920]  Everyone knows that we warned of plans to instigate martial law using Sibyl unrest by the Clintons
[47:36.920 --> 47:38.440]  and Obama.
[47:38.440 --> 47:42.120]  I first learned about that from the Chief of Police of San Antonio who had been in Army
[47:42.120 --> 47:46.360]  Intelligence and then had people in the Army warn him about it and that Clinton was using
[47:46.360 --> 47:51.400]  Delta Force to go around and get towns and cities ready for martial law.
[47:51.400 --> 47:54.160]  He was considering not leaving office.
[47:54.160 --> 47:57.920]  Then Obama continued to plan and that's been mainstream news.
[47:57.920 --> 48:03.320]  So then people say, oh, but now you want President Trump to do something to the Clintons.
[48:03.320 --> 48:08.000]  Yeah, I don't want martial law over the country, over Congress, over anybody.
[48:08.000 --> 48:12.920]  We need to have the top cabal of the FBI and the Clintons and the rest of them and Clapper
[48:12.920 --> 48:17.160]  and Brennan and all these other people that lie to Congress and are part of this cabal
[48:17.160 --> 48:20.920]  locked up until they can be tried by juries.
[48:20.920 --> 48:21.920]  They're dangerous.
[48:21.920 --> 48:26.760]  They're an organized crime syndicate just running around the worst I've ever seen and
[48:26.760 --> 48:28.720]  they're paid off by the Communist Chinese.
[48:28.720 --> 48:30.040]  They're arrogant.
[48:30.040 --> 48:32.560]  Phil Mudd should be in a jail cell right now.
[48:32.560 --> 48:37.680]  He is the former head of counterterrorism of the CIA and the FBI, an adjunct protege
[48:37.680 --> 48:42.440]  of Mueller saying the government's going to kill this guy and all of a sudden he has so
[48:42.440 --> 48:47.040]  much anger for the president on TV, he starts spitting everywhere and he's a guy that could
[48:47.040 --> 48:48.560]  get that kind of stuff done.
[48:48.560 --> 48:53.360]  If you had a terrorist that had bombed 50 buildings and he was walking around saying,
[48:53.360 --> 48:59.560]  I'm going to blow up your school next week, he's a clear and present danger to everybody.
[48:59.560 --> 49:06.480]  And then Paul mentions top Marine Corps general said, get ready.
[49:06.480 --> 49:08.880]  We're in more danger of war now than ever.
[49:08.880 --> 49:11.280]  We're going to war.
[49:11.280 --> 49:14.440]  That was just a few weeks ago.
[49:14.440 --> 49:19.000]  And the Republican platform didn't say arm the western side of the Ukrainians, so they
[49:19.000 --> 49:22.360]  called that Russian meddling or helping the Russians.
[49:22.360 --> 49:24.520]  So now Trump sent a bunch of weapons over there.
[49:24.520 --> 49:25.520]  This is all out of control.
[49:25.520 --> 49:28.880]  We can put those headlines up on screen that we found.
[49:28.880 --> 49:33.600]  Top Democrats warn of ongoing attack down the headliner in the break about the Republican
[49:33.600 --> 49:34.600]  platform.
[49:34.600 --> 49:39.680]  Again, no mention of arming the Ukrainians, but now all that's happened.
[49:39.680 --> 49:40.680]  US troops are massing.
[49:40.680 --> 49:47.320]  Again, I'm going to find the article top Marine general says that he believes that the world
[49:47.320 --> 49:48.680]  is going to war.
[49:48.680 --> 49:52.440]  And then he says specifically with Russia, because of all this, when he visited troops
[49:52.440 --> 49:58.320]  on the Russian border, we're going to put that headline up to Paul Joseph Watson.
[49:58.320 --> 49:59.400]  You were getting into this.
[49:59.400 --> 50:03.520]  What do we do with this cabal?
[50:03.520 --> 50:10.960]  Well, you're talking about the Russia thing again, with the release the memo MSNBC apparently
[50:10.960 --> 50:15.640]  just showing my tweets and your tweets saying that this has proof where Russian bots and
[50:15.640 --> 50:20.680]  where part of the Russian bot network, because we tweeted the hashtag release the memo, even
[50:20.680 --> 50:26.560]  though the daily beast again, which is hardly Trump sympathetic, is it, and Twitter's own
[50:26.560 --> 50:32.200]  internal analysis, we posted this today, has thus far found authentic American American
[50:32.200 --> 50:37.480]  accounts and not Russian imposters or automated bots are driving the hashtag release the memo
[50:37.480 --> 50:38.480]  tag.
[50:38.480 --> 50:41.920]  There are no preliminary indications that the Twitter activity either driving the hashtag
[50:41.920 --> 50:45.640]  or engaging with it is either from predominantly Russian.
[50:45.640 --> 50:49.640]  So that's daily beast and it's Twitter's own internal analysis.
[50:49.640 --> 50:54.200]  That's not us saying that yet still MSNBC apparently from a message that somebody just
[50:54.200 --> 50:59.280]  sent me on Twitter is throwing up my tweets and your tweets saying, look, this proves
[50:59.280 --> 51:01.520]  where part of the Russian bot network.
[51:01.520 --> 51:03.200]  It's absolutely conspiracy theory.
[51:03.200 --> 51:06.160]  They accuse us of being conspiracy theorists.
[51:06.160 --> 51:07.160]  This is conspiracy theory.
[51:07.160 --> 51:12.120]  But Paul, they said they intend to overturn the election overturn the congressional elections.
[51:12.120 --> 51:14.520]  They federalize the elections under Obama.
[51:14.520 --> 51:15.560]  Trump hasn't reversed it.
[51:15.560 --> 51:18.640]  And they say they're going to arrest everybody.
[51:18.640 --> 51:21.920]  When you oppose the EU, they say you're a Russian agent and now Germany wants to arrest
[51:21.920 --> 51:23.480]  people that oppose the EU.
[51:23.480 --> 51:25.080]  This is their excuse to come get us, buddy.
[51:25.080 --> 51:26.080]  They're serious.
[51:26.080 --> 51:28.640]  They're really getting desperate.
[51:28.640 --> 51:33.520]  And as I mentioned before the break, you got the expansion of NATO, you got the arms sales
[51:33.520 --> 51:34.920]  to Ukraine.
[51:34.920 --> 51:40.040]  You got neocons within the Trump administration that trying to prove it's not a Russian proxy
[51:40.040 --> 51:45.120]  by becoming antagonistic towards Russia and look at the effect, Estonia to issue how to
[51:45.120 --> 51:49.720]  prepare for war leaflets to 1.3 million citizens.
[51:49.720 --> 51:51.680]  You've got Sweden doing the same thing.
[51:51.680 --> 51:55.160]  Swedes told how to prepare for war as Russia fears grow.
[51:55.160 --> 52:01.000]  They've sent out these brochures to 4.7 million households, warning them for the first time
[52:01.000 --> 52:05.040]  in more than half a century of what they should do in the event of war.
[52:05.040 --> 52:10.040]  And suddenly left us all over the world, hate Russia and want war with it because communists
[52:10.040 --> 52:14.880]  don't run it anymore and they don't get to stomp and murder and rape Christians anymore.
[52:14.880 --> 52:18.040]  That's why Bernie Sanders, all of them would go there and have their honeymoons because
[52:18.040 --> 52:20.560]  that's the place where they get to hurt the Christians.
[52:20.560 --> 52:23.560]  That's the place where they get that.
[52:23.560 --> 52:28.800]  They have power finally and now it's not under their control anymore, Paul.
[52:28.800 --> 52:34.840]  Well, exactly, meanwhile, arming the worst jihadist in Syria that literally cut people's
[52:34.840 --> 52:38.080]  hearts out and eat them on camera, that's conservative.
[52:38.080 --> 52:40.120]  Because they murder Christians.
[52:40.120 --> 52:44.400]  Now, obviously, Estonia is a member of NATO under the treaty.
[52:44.400 --> 52:46.440]  The United States would have to defend it.
[52:46.440 --> 52:48.040]  This is what this is all leading to.
[52:48.040 --> 52:49.040]  This is the real danger.
[52:49.040 --> 52:53.880]  In fact, there's an article which he can talk about, which really encapsulates it.
[52:53.880 --> 52:59.840]  A year ago, Maddow explained how MSN would use Russiagate to escalate Cold War and they
[52:59.840 --> 53:04.840]  laid it out and they give all the examples, expanding NATO, a permanent military presence
[53:04.840 --> 53:10.400]  in Syria, assigning the neocon Russian Hawk Kurt Volcker, a special representative to
[53:10.400 --> 53:14.800]  the Ukraine, shutting down a Russian consulate in San Francisco.
[53:14.800 --> 53:19.600]  They're doing all this to prove they're not Russian agents and it's increasing the likelihood
[53:19.600 --> 53:21.800]  of World War III.
[53:21.800 --> 53:22.880]  It's incredible, Alex.
[53:22.880 --> 53:24.520]  This is the real danger.
[53:24.520 --> 53:28.340]  And then you go back to the so-called violent threats that were included in these missing
[53:28.340 --> 53:29.840]  FBI text messages.
[53:29.840 --> 53:32.800]  I mean, this is not an out there proposition.
[53:32.800 --> 53:35.280]  You had bus feed internal communications.
[53:35.280 --> 53:39.920]  We featured this back in May last year where they were talking about Trump's assassination.
[53:39.920 --> 53:44.840]  We've had top London Times journalists wishing for the assassination of Trump.
[53:44.840 --> 53:48.840]  You had, I think, there's a state senator in Missouri who said, quote, I hope Trump
[53:48.840 --> 53:50.200]  is assassinated.
[53:50.200 --> 53:51.960]  They all talk like this.
[53:51.960 --> 53:57.680]  So why shouldn't we expect these antagonistic anti-Trump FBI agents to talk like this too?
[53:57.680 --> 54:03.320]  The question is whether it went beyond talk and something more dark, something more sinister,
[54:03.320 --> 54:06.520]  which is what Madd talked about when he said, you know, the government's just going to kill
[54:06.520 --> 54:07.520]  this guy.
[54:07.520 --> 54:09.600]  So how far along the path did it go?
[54:09.600 --> 54:10.600]  That's the question.
[54:10.600 --> 54:14.320]  I'm really surprised that all these people saying kill the president are still walking
[54:14.320 --> 54:15.320]  around.
[54:15.320 --> 54:17.600]  I mean, the president has rights too.
[54:17.600 --> 54:18.600]  And I'm serious.
[54:18.600 --> 54:21.240]  These people are threatening all of us, our country, our recovery.
[54:21.240 --> 54:22.240]  I'm done.
[54:22.240 --> 54:23.240]  And here's the other thing, Paul.
[54:23.240 --> 54:25.880]  Do they think they're really going to kill the president and then get away with it?
[54:25.880 --> 54:31.360]  Because I'm here to tell them that they should know that the military, former and current,
[54:31.360 --> 54:34.840]  is all, has them in their sights right now.
[54:34.840 --> 54:38.680]  Don't these people get that the sleeping giant isn't asleep anymore, that this isn't a one-way
[54:38.680 --> 54:39.680]  street?
[54:39.680 --> 54:43.960]  Well, you would think that would want to be one of the things that gave them pause for
[54:43.960 --> 54:44.960]  thought.
[54:44.960 --> 54:45.960]  And then you've got the media.
[54:45.960 --> 54:50.720]  Remember before the election, the guy jumped up on stage and tried to attack Trump.
[54:50.720 --> 54:52.680]  Secret service rushed around and dragged him away.
[54:52.680 --> 54:54.920]  The next day he was up on CNN.
[54:54.920 --> 54:59.480]  They were lionizing him, giving him a platform to spread his hysterical message.
[54:59.480 --> 55:04.440]  So the media doesn't, if they did kill Trump, a lot of people in the media would openly
[55:04.440 --> 55:05.440]  celebrate it.
[55:05.440 --> 55:06.440]  The resistance.
[55:06.440 --> 55:10.800]  They'd be out on the streets with bloons and they'd be getting drunk.
[55:10.800 --> 55:11.800]  They'd love it.
[55:11.800 --> 55:14.520]  I mean, we'd become so vulgar as a society.
[55:14.520 --> 55:18.440]  This is openly what people would embrace and welcome at this point.
[55:18.440 --> 55:20.880]  And Paul, they admit they're trying to start a race war.
[55:20.880 --> 55:24.840]  It's not working, but they keep pushing it, documents to tell plan for civil unrest and
[55:24.840 --> 55:26.400]  martial law in Baltimore.
[55:26.400 --> 55:27.960]  I mean, what are we supposed to do?
[55:27.960 --> 55:30.720]  Because I'm not somebody that wants to do offensive stuff.
[55:30.720 --> 55:34.880]  I mean, we're winning the Info War here and we're winning culturally, but they're not
[55:34.880 --> 55:36.200]  going to let us win.
[55:36.200 --> 55:40.520]  My gut tells me they're going to pull something big now that they're getting exposed with
[55:40.520 --> 55:41.520]  Russia gate.
[55:41.520 --> 55:42.520]  What do you think, Paul?
[55:42.520 --> 55:48.080]  Well, I mean, you'd hope that we could just be the voice of reason and prevent anything
[55:48.080 --> 55:49.080]  like that happening.
[55:49.080 --> 55:51.120]  But they're so demented at this point.
[55:51.120 --> 55:56.080]  I've long predicted that one of these Antifa members, one of these SJWs will go postal.
[55:56.080 --> 56:01.440]  And that happened, by the way, James T. Hodgkinson, that could have been a massacre way worse
[56:01.440 --> 56:02.440]  than it was.
[56:02.440 --> 56:05.160]  If not for responsible people with guns who stopped it.
[56:05.160 --> 56:09.040]  There was the PIA 39 terrorist in San Francisco over Christmas.
[56:09.040 --> 56:10.640]  That got glossed over, didn't it?
[56:10.640 --> 56:12.360]  This guy planned a massacre.
[56:12.360 --> 56:13.920]  You went on his Facebook page.
[56:13.920 --> 56:18.360]  It was all CNN, MSNBC, and Tifa the whole way.
[56:18.360 --> 56:20.040]  Nobody even picked up on that.
[56:20.040 --> 56:24.520]  So you've got all these demented people on the fringes, obviously the vast majority of
[56:24.520 --> 56:25.920]  them aren't going to do anything.
[56:25.920 --> 56:28.400]  They can barely crawl out their pajamas.
[56:28.400 --> 56:33.640]  But some of them are actually psychotic and will kill large numbers of people and think
[56:33.640 --> 56:38.960]  that they're in the right for doing it because Trump is either a Russian agent or the new
[56:38.960 --> 56:39.960]  Hitler.
[56:39.960 --> 56:43.120]  And they've been fed that narrative, Alex, for the past 18 months.
[56:43.120 --> 56:44.120]  That's right.
[56:44.120 --> 56:45.120]  Paul, stay there.
[56:45.120 --> 56:46.840]  They're going to think they're the good guys.
[56:46.840 --> 56:50.840]  Do two more segments with us because we've got video that's on infowars.com.
[56:50.840 --> 56:55.160]  When we come back, they can send all this, their attack on free speech, CNN has like
[56:55.160 --> 56:57.640]  a mall area by the convention center in Atlanta.
[56:57.640 --> 57:02.360]  They banned a guy from wearing our CNN, infowars.com is fake news shirt.
[57:02.360 --> 57:03.360]  So that's coming up.
[57:03.360 --> 57:06.520]  So get your CNN is fake news shirt, infowars.com.
[57:06.520 --> 57:10.880]  We've had eight different designs, six of them are sold out.
[57:10.880 --> 57:18.080]  There's two other CNN versions that we have an infowars.com that are collectors additions.
[57:18.080 --> 57:19.600]  I believe that's one of our shirts.
[57:19.600 --> 57:23.840]  But regardless, they're all there, infowars.com, infowarslife.com.
[57:23.840 --> 57:27.040]  This thing's got hundreds of thousands of views just on one Facebook channel by them
[57:27.040 --> 57:28.240]  trying to ban it.
[57:28.240 --> 57:33.000]  The guy was at a boat show at the convention center and then it's part of it and he wanders
[57:33.000 --> 57:37.520]  over and it's CNN property in this little mall area and they throw him out for a speech,
[57:37.520 --> 57:41.880]  which is their right to do, but it's our right to show what incredible authoritarians they
[57:41.880 --> 58:10.600]  are infowarsstore.com I'm Alex Jones stay with us.
[58:10.600 --> 58:14.960]  In the history of infowars life, we brought out a lot of amazing products like survival
[58:14.960 --> 58:20.000]  shield X2, super male vitality and so many others with its unique delivery system and
[58:20.000 --> 58:24.200]  proprietary manufacturing process designed for maximize effects.
[58:24.200 --> 58:30.600]  This formula is the platinum standard of multivitamin mineral products and this part is most important.
[58:30.600 --> 58:35.880]  The ingredients in vitamin mineral fusion are either plant derived or of the highest
[58:35.880 --> 58:37.560]  quality lab standard.
[58:37.560 --> 58:38.920]  That means it's clean.
[58:38.920 --> 58:39.920]  That means it's pure.
[58:39.920 --> 58:44.120]  And rest secured, you're finding the tip of the spear in the infowars, that's infowarslife.com
[58:44.120 --> 58:45.800]  and vitamin mineral fusion.
[58:45.800 --> 58:50.360]  Take action now before we sell out.
[58:50.360 --> 58:51.960]  Matt and Ohio, you're on the air.
[58:51.960 --> 58:52.960]  Another Matt, go ahead.
[58:52.960 --> 58:57.720]  Hey listen, I just wanted to say real quick, I'm a long time listener of infowars and
[58:57.720 --> 59:02.960]  I just wanted to say that the t-shirts that you guys are offering are absolutely fantastic
[59:02.960 --> 59:07.240]  and that really is a great way to deal with this battle in the infowars.
[59:07.240 --> 59:11.880]  It might seem like a simple thing but they particularly these slogan t-shirts that you
[59:11.880 --> 59:14.600]  guys got up right now are absolutely amazing.
[59:14.600 --> 59:15.600]  Well thank you.
[59:15.600 --> 59:20.880]  My favorite new one is the don't tread on me but it says won't tread on me and it's
[59:20.880 --> 59:25.640]  a big day glow snake, Gadsden snake and then it's got the American flag infowars.com on
[59:25.640 --> 59:26.640]  the right arm.
[59:26.640 --> 59:31.960]  I mean that's a great way just to meet like-minded people and spread the word and also exercise
[59:31.960 --> 59:32.960]  free speech.
[59:32.960 --> 59:38.520]  The newest one is trigger warning t-shirt, trigger warning t-shirt which is the symbol
[59:38.520 --> 59:43.000]  of a trigger with a yield sign in the infowars.com on the back.
[59:43.000 --> 59:52.280]  That is the new shirt of the month available exclusively at infowarsstore.com.
[59:52.280 --> 01:00:13.760]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:00:13.760 --> 01:00:26.400]  Coming up in the next segment with Paul Watson, we're just going to get into the crazy climate
[01:00:26.400 --> 01:00:30.960]  as all the secret societies and Democrat cabals and their plans for violence begin
[01:00:30.960 --> 01:00:31.960]  to come out.
[01:00:31.960 --> 01:00:37.600]  FBI agents are set to testify to Congress, they're already informing on just the incredible
[01:00:37.600 --> 01:00:41.600]  corruption going on there and why Hillary was so arrogant.
[01:00:41.600 --> 01:00:47.160]  That video sent to us this morning that we've now posted to infowars.com is from Kerry
[01:00:47.160 --> 01:00:52.080]  Leadingham and it's already got 170,000 views.
[01:00:52.080 --> 01:00:54.920]  It's at CNN Center in Atlanta.
[01:00:54.920 --> 01:01:01.280]  Now to explain this, it's their private property, they have a right to throw this guy out that
[01:01:01.280 --> 01:01:07.600]  Kerry posted video of this individual being thrown out but he's simply wearing a CNN
[01:01:07.600 --> 01:01:21.640]  is fake new shirt and he's simply wearing the CNN shirt of radio listeners I'm setting
[01:01:21.640 --> 01:01:30.880]  this up and it's in a big kind of mall chaos, some restaurants, some shops and then CNN's
[01:01:30.880 --> 01:01:36.520]  offices are up above but it's CNN's property, they own that little slash kind of mall area
[01:01:36.520 --> 01:01:43.160]  as their chaos CNN center and attached to it is the convention center where he was looking
[01:01:43.160 --> 01:01:47.800]  at the boat show so they remove him out of there.
[01:01:47.800 --> 01:01:51.160]  Now again, you hear about people wearing NRA shirts being removed from shopping malls
[01:01:51.160 --> 01:01:52.160]  as well.
[01:01:52.160 --> 01:01:57.120]  It shows the leftist authoritarianism, we were all enjoying the Atlanta boat show when
[01:01:57.120 --> 01:02:03.320]  we went for dinner break at CNN building, got kicked out for a t-shirt on our friend.
[01:02:03.320 --> 01:02:30.480]  So there it is, I'm about to play the video and then get Paul Watson's take, here it is.
[01:02:30.480 --> 01:02:35.400]  So CNN has no ratings, they're falling apart, they're attached to the convention center
[01:02:35.400 --> 01:02:39.360]  and people say well it's their property, no I understand but their anti-free speech is
[01:02:39.360 --> 01:02:45.080]  the point and it just shows how the media is all into censorship on the streets, anti-fogal
[01:02:45.080 --> 01:02:49.120]  point guns that if you try to go to the Austin Capitol for memorial for a woman killed by
[01:02:49.120 --> 01:02:54.600]  a legal alien who they set free, if you try to go online they censor you, CNN puts out
[01:02:54.600 --> 01:02:59.160]  fake polls, they're in the WikiLeaks giving Hillary the questions beforehand in Dona Brazil,
[01:02:59.160 --> 01:03:02.680]  I mean it just shows their total culture, Paul.
[01:03:02.680 --> 01:03:07.400]  Well it's the total hostility to the first amendment to freedom of speech, like that's
[01:03:07.400 --> 01:03:12.760]  an offensive t-shirt, I mean who cares, they make more, if the more a big deal they make
[01:03:12.760 --> 01:03:17.440]  out of it the more it just reflects on themselves, I mean CNN is a joke at this point, even after
[01:03:17.440 --> 01:03:23.000]  the whole Trump was mentally deranged, he had dementia thing was completely demolished,
[01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:27.880]  they was still on that Alex, I mean ask how I get over that, Brian Stelter who said it
[01:03:27.880 --> 01:03:33.120]  was reckless conspiracy theories to speculate on Hillary Clinton's health, even after the
[01:03:33.120 --> 01:03:38.480]  doctor came out and said Trump was completely fine, he still said no this hasn't been resolved
[01:03:38.480 --> 01:03:42.480]  yet, so that's why they're fake news because when they're fake news narrative that Trump
[01:03:42.480 --> 01:03:47.200]  had dementia that he was unfair, it was completely debunked, they just kept on with it, so that's
[01:03:47.200 --> 01:03:53.120]  the essence of fake news, he got Jim Acosta, how can he still call himself a reporter,
[01:03:53.120 --> 01:03:58.080]  I mean I don't pretend to be non-partisan Alex, but people like him do, he's a far-left
[01:03:58.080 --> 01:04:00.560]  activist as is virtually everyone that works there.
[01:04:00.560 --> 01:04:05.080]  So they're all on video at the DNC dancing and looking at Hillary like she's a rock star
[01:04:05.080 --> 01:04:08.120]  and there's so many fake news things with Acosta, I don't know where to begin, I mean
[01:04:08.120 --> 01:04:14.200]  he said Trump did not visit Congressman Scalise, they also said again that there was no Martin
[01:04:14.200 --> 01:04:18.160]  Luther King bust when there's video when they're in there with it, I mean these people
[01:04:18.160 --> 01:04:24.440]  know their liars Paul. And they had like a year ago they probably had like three commentators
[01:04:24.440 --> 01:04:29.080]  who were vaguely pro-Trump, I think they just fired the last one, so it's like a complete
[01:04:29.080 --> 01:04:35.440]  echo chamber at CNN, even for the back and forth of good TV, they don't want that anymore,
[01:04:35.440 --> 01:04:41.600]  no, they said socialism was cool Alex, I mean did you cover that tweet, he was an environmental
[01:04:41.600 --> 01:04:47.040]  hero, he's a socialist before it was cool talking about MLK, while Venezuelans are literally
[01:04:47.040 --> 01:04:52.160]  having to butcher zoo animals to stay alive, CNN is telling them, they hate the zoo animals
[01:04:52.160 --> 01:04:57.380]  four years ago Paul, they're basically eating dead people now.
[01:04:57.380 --> 01:05:01.720]  You know I've got some talking points here about caveman from infowarslife.com, but instead
[01:05:01.720 --> 01:05:05.960]  of going on those talking points, let me just give you what I've experienced personally.
[01:05:05.960 --> 01:05:10.520]  From all the wives tales in every culture we know that the bones have the essence, we
[01:05:10.520 --> 01:05:14.760]  know chicken noodle soup is great for people that are sick, again in every culture this
[01:05:14.760 --> 01:05:21.480]  has been reported because it works, and there's no way to quantify how strong this is, but
[01:05:21.480 --> 01:05:28.040]  the amount of bone protein and the amount of marrow and the amount of concentrated life
[01:05:28.040 --> 01:05:31.200]  force that is in this is incredible.
[01:05:31.200 --> 01:05:35.080]  Ladies and gentlemen, whether it's for your joints, whether it's for your arteries and
[01:05:35.080 --> 01:05:40.320]  your veins, whether it's for your brain, whether it's for energy, this ladies and gentlemen
[01:05:40.320 --> 01:05:47.280]  is the strongest, most concentrated bone broth formula out there, and it's amazing.
[01:05:47.280 --> 01:05:51.560]  Find out for yourself today at infowarsstore.com, what you can do for your family, and again
[01:05:51.560 --> 01:06:11.120]  I want to thank you all for your support, your funding, the information war in 2018.
[01:06:11.120 --> 01:06:32.800]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are back live, I am your host Alex Jones, Paul Watson's riding
[01:06:32.800 --> 01:06:37.600]  shotgun with us for another segment, then I'm going to get into all the congressional
[01:06:37.600 --> 01:06:41.760]  testimony, all the new videos with senators and House members that have talked to the
[01:06:41.760 --> 01:06:47.400]  informants, the FBI, that witnessed the cabal inside of the Justice Department trying to
[01:06:47.400 --> 01:06:51.960]  frame President Trump, the American people, and any conservative Christian libertarian
[01:06:51.960 --> 01:06:55.480]  you name it, as a Russian operative.
[01:06:55.480 --> 01:07:02.520]  It's so bold, it's so crazy, that is all coming up, I'm going to open the phones up as well.
[01:07:02.520 --> 01:07:08.760]  These reports on infowars.com, missing FBI text messages include threats of violence
[01:07:08.760 --> 01:07:14.120]  against Trump, FBI agents sent jaw-dropping text about no Russia collusion, that was
[01:07:14.120 --> 01:07:18.440]  Strock, six months into it he goes, man I'm really concerned, this is all fake, there's
[01:07:18.440 --> 01:07:24.760]  nothing here, well just make up some stuff like Mueller does, so again I wonder if Strock's
[01:07:24.760 --> 01:07:33.680]  the one that's turned state's evidence, Senator Ron Johnson, FBI informant says secret society
[01:07:33.680 --> 01:07:39.200]  held secret meetings off-site, all of that is on DrudgeReport.com, NewsWars.com, but
[01:07:39.200 --> 01:07:43.360]  I want to shift gears into something even bigger right now, and that's Vegas, we've
[01:07:43.360 --> 01:07:48.280]  had senators come out, we've had Congressman Perry come out of Pennsylvania and say he's
[01:07:48.280 --> 01:07:52.960]  talked to sources that show clear credible evidence that ISIS was involved, not just
[01:07:52.960 --> 01:07:56.920]  them taking credit, not just them a week before putting out graphics saying they were going
[01:07:56.920 --> 01:08:05.440]  to attack, not now Strock, the FBI admits, okay, that Strock on the mind, now they're
[01:08:05.440 --> 01:08:14.520]  coming out admitting that the so-called main Vegas shooter was reportedly a gun runner,
[01:08:14.520 --> 01:08:19.040]  had gone to the Middle East, did have these contacts, was involved in this, they're looking
[01:08:19.040 --> 01:08:25.080]  at multiple shooters, the whole dam on this is breaking, we have an article on infowars.com
[01:08:25.080 --> 01:08:30.040]  that we're going to put on screen for folks that Paul Watson's about to talk about, Paul.
[01:08:30.040 --> 01:08:36.920]  Yeah, it's ISIS group puts crosshairs on Vegas hotel in threat to shed dirty blood,
[01:08:36.920 --> 01:08:42.680]  that's out today, it's PJ Media, so they put out yet another video in which they zero in
[01:08:42.680 --> 01:08:47.760]  on a strip hotel, it's not the Mandalay Bay Hotel but it is a hotel in Vegas, it says
[01:08:47.760 --> 01:08:51.520]  the disbeliever West will see our power through the jihad of sincere people and the sacrifice
[01:08:51.520 --> 01:08:57.320]  of monotheists, so basically they're threatening to attack Las Vegas again, now remember, when
[01:08:57.320 --> 01:09:02.920]  they claimed responsibility for the Las Vegas massacre, everyone came out and said, oh, ISIS
[01:09:02.920 --> 01:09:07.920]  claims responsibility for everything, no, that's not true, people went back and found
[01:09:07.920 --> 01:09:13.200]  that even ISIS attacks that had been done by ISIS sympathizers, ISIS didn't even claim
[01:09:13.200 --> 01:09:17.880]  responsibility for them, if they were not directly involved, they only claim responsibility
[01:09:17.880 --> 01:09:22.480]  if they're directly involved, they did for the Las Vegas massacre, of course, they had
[01:09:22.480 --> 01:09:28.400]  propaganda before it happened, saying they were targeting Las Vegas, they teased, there's
[01:09:28.400 --> 01:09:33.160]  another headline, ISIS teases Vegas in upcoming sequel to original film threatening America
[01:09:33.160 --> 01:09:37.280]  that was November 29th, so they're obsessed with Las Vegas, they've threatened to attack
[01:09:37.280 --> 01:09:43.160]  it again today, we had the Congressman Scott Perry come out about a week ago on Fox News,
[01:09:43.160 --> 01:09:47.520]  saying that there's a terrorist connection to the Las Vegas massacre, and of course,
[01:09:47.520 --> 01:09:51.960]  we had the source, the former Trump campaign official, who by the way is connected to the
[01:09:51.960 --> 01:09:57.440]  same source that reveals today the threatening violent message as the President Trump, which
[01:09:57.440 --> 01:10:01.880]  has been proven correct, because the same source behind that predicted the secret society
[01:10:01.880 --> 01:10:06.880]  one month before it was in the news, but this source came out, the former Trump campaign
[01:10:06.880 --> 01:10:13.240]  official and said, Stephen Paddock made an ISIS tape where he sat down and basically pledged
[01:10:13.240 --> 01:10:19.120]  allegiance to ISIS before the massacre, so this ISIS connection to the Las Vegas massacre
[01:10:19.120 --> 01:10:24.080]  isn't going away, they've already confirmed they're looking at different suspects, potentially
[01:10:24.080 --> 01:10:28.160]  outside suspects that may have been involved in the attack other than Paddock, so this
[01:10:28.160 --> 01:10:32.920]  is starting to come together that it's a wider plot and that it was a terrorist plot, and
[01:10:32.920 --> 01:10:37.560]  they've offered no other explanation, no other motive.
[01:10:37.560 --> 01:10:44.480]  And Paul, day one, our FBI sources, the day after it happened, said they went to the
[01:10:44.480 --> 01:10:52.240]  Middle East, there was a woman visiting days before, gun runner, we were the first to break
[01:10:52.240 --> 01:10:59.520]  all of that and those were real sources, so this guy had the classic cut out of all of
[01:10:59.520 --> 01:11:04.560]  this, I then received even more information, I'm not allowed to release on air, we had
[01:11:04.560 --> 01:11:10.080]  individuals travel here from another state with video of his brother and I'm just going
[01:11:10.080 --> 01:11:12.680]  to leave it at that and then they made the decision with their lawyers not to let us
[01:11:12.680 --> 01:11:17.280]  use it, which is fine, now that the FBI has it, they know what's going on here and it
[01:11:17.280 --> 01:11:22.640]  is unbelievable, what's your best thinking on this, I think our army intelligence source
[01:11:22.640 --> 01:11:27.520]  that laid out the Saudi Arabians having a big convention there, some groups use that
[01:11:27.520 --> 01:11:31.360]  as the cover with thousands of people coming in from the Middle East to get in, then they
[01:11:31.360 --> 01:11:35.320]  needed weapons, so they made contacts with a gun runner, they'd gotten weapons before
[01:11:35.320 --> 01:11:40.600]  from and then use that as the cut out and the cover for the mass shooting operation,
[01:11:40.600 --> 01:11:44.760]  which was a message against Trump just weeks before he rolled up the whole wild hobbyist
[01:11:44.760 --> 01:11:49.680]  globalist arm that was fighting the Clintons inside Saudi Arabia.
[01:11:49.680 --> 01:11:54.640]  I think obviously it was a massively wider plot than it was, he'd researched other targets,
[01:11:54.640 --> 01:11:59.040]  he was attempting to hit one of the, what was it, the fuel tank nearby to cause a massive
[01:11:59.040 --> 01:12:04.400]  explosion, it was obviously a terrorist attack, how can it not have a motive, I mean even
[01:12:04.400 --> 01:12:10.040]  with the Texas church massacre, they found some kind of motive behind that, it's absolutely
[01:12:10.040 --> 01:12:15.920]  incredible that this was just one guy, just some random miltoist guy who went postal,
[01:12:15.920 --> 01:12:19.280]  there's all kinds of questions about whether other people involved and now they've admitted
[01:12:19.280 --> 01:12:23.280]  that they're investigating other people, there's surveillance tapes of things that we were
[01:12:23.280 --> 01:12:27.400]  told didn't happen, casualties that weren't even attended to for like two hours.
[01:12:27.400 --> 01:12:30.840]  All the eyewitnesses, the sheriff a few days into it said obviously he had help and it's
[01:12:30.840 --> 01:12:35.120]  horrible, we're looking at that evidence and then he comes out, oh no there's no help
[01:12:35.120 --> 01:12:38.840]  and looks like he's being told a lie, I mean the guy looked like he was about to kill himself,
[01:12:38.840 --> 01:12:44.920]  I mean why did the sheriff suddenly look normal saying yeah there's people helping him, looking
[01:12:44.920 --> 01:12:49.960]  like he was just totally depressed when he went up there and said no one helped him.
[01:12:49.960 --> 01:12:54.840]  Also the contradiction of if he had an escape plan which they say he planned to escape after
[01:12:54.840 --> 01:13:00.040]  the attack right, why did he shoot himself in the head and then there's a massive disconnection
[01:13:00.040 --> 01:13:04.840]  between the actual timeline we were originally told and what happened with him being discovered,
[01:13:04.840 --> 01:13:08.560]  so none of these questions have been answered, they said what, it'd take a year from when
[01:13:08.560 --> 01:13:14.440]  it took place to have any kind of clue, I think it's ISIS Alex, I mean that's what I thought
[01:13:14.440 --> 01:13:17.840]  when it first happened, it was later confirmed in terms of then making a call for it.
[01:13:17.840 --> 01:13:23.080]  We had a few weeks before we're going to attack Vegas and he's going to be drenched in blood.
[01:13:23.080 --> 01:13:27.840]  And they don't claim responsibility for attacks, they're not involved in, that's a myth, that's
[01:13:27.840 --> 01:13:31.560]  a myth that the news media put out straight afterwards and people actually pointed out,
[01:13:31.560 --> 01:13:35.720]  no that's not true and they, you know they won't claim responsibility for attacks that
[01:13:35.720 --> 01:13:38.280]  are done in their name if they weren't directly involved.
[01:13:38.280 --> 01:13:42.840]  That's right and Paul let's be clear, let's be 100% clear, the FBI has had to change the
[01:13:42.840 --> 01:13:47.720]  story six different times, the local sheriff's department has as well and as you said the
[01:13:47.720 --> 01:13:52.000]  whole timeline's wrong, multiple shooters, the witnesses, the people saying get out of
[01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:57.440]  here you'll be dead in 45 minutes, the hundreds of rounds fired down the hall, I mean gun
[01:13:57.440 --> 01:14:03.200]  battles around the town, I mean this was a fiasco and all we're saying is we're being
[01:14:03.200 --> 01:14:07.040]  lied to and they call us fake news for that, well you know what, we've been proven right
[01:14:07.040 --> 01:14:08.040]  again.
[01:14:08.040 --> 01:14:15.240]  Paul, how much information did we know about 9-11 within like three days, we knew the
[01:14:15.240 --> 01:14:19.000]  embaltive, most of the people involved in it what, within like a week or two, they had
[01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:23.920]  all the names, they had all the passports, were here what, four months later and we don't
[01:14:23.920 --> 01:14:28.080]  know anything about this, it's absolutely insane, there's obviously some kind of cover-up
[01:14:28.080 --> 01:14:32.840]  taking place, for what reason I don't know, but I genuinely think it was a terrorist attack
[01:14:32.840 --> 01:14:36.120]  and it involved ISIS from everything that I've seen.
[01:14:36.120 --> 01:14:42.840]  Well, I was shown footage and then deleted it because we weren't allowed to use it,
[01:14:42.840 --> 01:14:47.040]  it was very interesting and I'll just say it's been given to the FBI and it just adds
[01:14:47.040 --> 01:14:52.920]  to all of this, but this brother, I mean the brother is clearly the whole family's plastic
[01:14:52.920 --> 01:14:56.080]  intelligence cutouts, doesn't they just have hundreds of thousands of dollars a week to
[01:14:56.080 --> 01:15:03.280]  magically go basically launder through the casinos, that's what the casinos are for Paul.
[01:15:03.280 --> 01:15:07.040]  It's incredible, there's also been several deaths of people who were down at the scene
[01:15:07.040 --> 01:15:12.800]  involved in the shooting, you had the eyewitnesses who were working the stalls, working for the
[01:15:12.800 --> 01:15:17.560]  concert, they were selling the merchandise, selling the food, the FBI came and wiped their
[01:15:17.560 --> 01:15:22.640]  phones and their laptops the next day or a couple of days later, completely wiped them,
[01:15:22.640 --> 01:15:27.960]  they never got them back, I mean is that routine operating procedure from what I read, it wasn't
[01:15:27.960 --> 01:15:34.440]  in all cases, so there's questions about that, why are they destroying evidence, so it's
[01:15:34.440 --> 01:15:37.240]  a big question mark, still hang over it for me Alex.
[01:15:37.240 --> 01:15:41.080]  What an incredible time to be alive, Paul Watson, thank you so much, the official story
[01:15:41.080 --> 01:15:45.040]  of Vegas has collapsed and congressmen and others are now saying that they've been given
[01:15:45.040 --> 01:15:50.320]  intelligence, it was ISIS and that more ISIS attacks are now playing, thank you Paul, we'll
[01:15:50.320 --> 01:15:56.840]  be back with all the big clips and more straight ahead, stay with us.
[01:15:56.840 --> 01:16:01.720]  Hear that, that's the sound of a house being trashed while a gang of thieves ransacked

[01:20:18.040 --> 01:20:22.520]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:20:22.520 --> 01:20:29.920]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[01:20:29.920 --> 01:20:34.800]  The fact that the world is so crazy right now makes my job really easy.
[01:20:34.800 --> 01:20:38.400]  Used to I'd come in here and go through several hundred articles and then try to get through
[01:20:38.400 --> 01:20:44.560]  most of them in three or four hours because I would change the topic every five minutes.
[01:20:44.560 --> 01:20:49.880]  There's not even a day out of the month goes by now where I go through half the stories.
[01:20:49.880 --> 01:20:50.880]  And I probably should.
[01:20:50.880 --> 01:20:56.120]  A lot of it's really important because the war news, the economy news, the Russiagate
[01:20:56.120 --> 01:21:06.360]  news, the leftist temper tantrums and violence all over the world is so insane that you can't
[01:21:06.360 --> 01:21:07.360]  turn away.
[01:21:07.360 --> 01:21:12.880]  And now Russiagate, that we've all known as completely ridiculous and fake, Russia can
[01:21:12.880 --> 01:21:14.880]  barely run its own country.
[01:21:14.880 --> 01:21:18.480]  It's the biggest in the world.
[01:21:18.480 --> 01:21:23.560]  China is literally, even the Washington Post admits, running almost every U.S. university
[01:21:23.560 --> 01:21:24.800]  controlling Hollywood.
[01:21:24.800 --> 01:21:27.480]  I mean, it's not the Chinese people, it's the Communist Chinese.
[01:21:27.480 --> 01:21:34.880]  But if you wanted to have some hysteria, China's got more control the U.S. than Trump does
[01:21:34.880 --> 01:21:36.920]  in many respects.
[01:21:36.920 --> 01:21:41.040]  But then there's this hoax where they have hearings and say, I'm a Russian and now Twitter
[01:21:41.040 --> 01:21:44.320]  sending out hundreds of thousands of emails.
[01:21:44.320 --> 01:21:48.640]  But three of our crew have gotten them saying, you are a Russian bot.
[01:21:48.640 --> 01:21:53.200]  And then the news is running with it today saying, proof Alex Jones is a Russian bot.
[01:21:53.200 --> 01:21:59.000]  Paul Watson's a Russian bot because I want to cut our taxes.
[01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:03.480]  And because FBI agents are blowing the whistle and we're catching them with their text messages
[01:22:03.480 --> 01:22:07.760]  making up lies about Russiagate, I'm a Russian bot.
[01:22:07.760 --> 01:22:16.760]  Think about the magnitude of those lies, but then there's the surrealness of all this.
[01:22:16.760 --> 01:22:21.520]  Because the reality is it's the Clintons in bed with the Russians and the Chinese and
[01:22:21.520 --> 01:22:28.880]  the rest of it and then to see Senator Ron Johnson on the secret society that the informants
[01:22:28.880 --> 01:22:30.480]  have told them about.
[01:22:30.480 --> 01:22:36.360]  And they have the text messages that say, today is the first day of the new secret society.
[01:22:36.360 --> 01:22:38.880]  And then the media goes, oh, well, did they really have one?
[01:22:38.880 --> 01:22:41.440]  What do you think a criminal cabal is?
[01:22:41.440 --> 01:22:47.280]  I've been calling it a criminal rogue group in the FBI.
[01:22:47.280 --> 01:22:56.840]  A La Cosa Nostra, which means our thing, then we're going to get to other incredible clips.
[01:22:56.840 --> 01:23:04.640]  But here is Senator Ron Johnson is further evidence of corruption, more than bias, but
[01:23:04.640 --> 01:23:08.640]  corruption at the highest levels of the FBI in that secret society.
[01:23:08.640 --> 01:23:12.960]  We have, we have an informant that's talking about a group that we're holding secret meetings
[01:23:12.960 --> 01:23:16.080]  off site that there's, there's so much smoke here.
[01:23:16.080 --> 01:23:17.080]  There's so much suspicion.
[01:23:17.080 --> 01:23:18.080]  Let's, let's stop there.
[01:23:18.080 --> 01:23:22.120]  A secret society, the secret meetings off site of the Justice Department.
[01:23:22.120 --> 01:23:23.120]  Correct.
[01:23:23.120 --> 01:23:24.960]  And you have an informant saying that.
[01:23:24.960 --> 01:23:25.960]  Yes.
[01:23:25.960 --> 01:23:27.880]  Is there anything more about that?
[01:23:27.880 --> 01:23:29.920]  No, we have to dig into it.
[01:23:29.920 --> 01:23:31.720]  That's, that's, this is not a distraction.
[01:23:31.720 --> 01:23:37.400]  Again, this is, this is bias potentially corruption at the highest levels of the FBI that is now
[01:23:37.400 --> 01:23:43.360]  investigating and now there's, and by the way, Robert Mueller used to run the FBI.
[01:23:43.360 --> 01:23:47.840]  He is in no position to do an investigation over this kind of misconduct.
[01:23:47.840 --> 01:23:51.280]  So I think at this point in time, we probably should be looking at a special counsel to
[01:23:51.280 --> 01:23:56.480]  undertake this investigation, but Congress is going to have to continue to dig.
[01:23:56.480 --> 01:23:58.280]  It's not just that he used to run the FBI.
[01:23:58.280 --> 01:24:03.800]  He covered up for the Clinton crimes, the Obama crimes, Comey did that.
[01:24:03.800 --> 01:24:09.400]  Then you've got them recommending the president, oh sir, McCabe's a good guy.
[01:24:09.400 --> 01:24:15.520]  He's not partisan and then he's the ring leader of it, the attorney general and Ron Rosenstein,
[01:24:15.520 --> 01:24:23.360]  the deputy attorney general, recommend McCabe, who is in the text messages as the ring leader.
[01:24:23.360 --> 01:24:24.960]  Sir, you can trust McCabe.
[01:24:24.960 --> 01:24:31.400]  He'll take care of you.
[01:24:31.400 --> 01:24:32.400]  It's incredible.
[01:24:32.400 --> 01:24:35.400]  It's like the school bus drivers, Jeffrey Dahmer.
[01:24:35.400 --> 01:24:40.640]  It's like Jeffrey will take care of the kids by Jeffrey and imagine you're the president
[01:24:40.640 --> 01:24:45.040]  now who had all these people recommended to him and they're the ones running the cabal
[01:24:45.040 --> 01:24:48.840]  that's been caught.
[01:24:48.840 --> 01:24:55.240]  Robert Mueller heads up one of the big law firms that you hire because it's all the former
[01:24:55.240 --> 01:25:00.400]  top FBI people and Justice Department people show that if they sign off on your foreign
[01:25:00.400 --> 01:25:03.720]  deal, you don't get indicted by the FBI.
[01:25:03.720 --> 01:25:10.280]  They're in the club and that's how Mueller's involved in 10 different Russian companies.
[01:25:10.280 --> 01:25:14.880]  He's got millions of dollars per company in some cases and never made an investment,
[01:25:14.880 --> 01:25:19.720]  but on the regular prospectus, you've got to invest money to be part of it.
[01:25:19.720 --> 01:25:25.400]  It's a giant cash machine and they're all incredibly corrupt and they thought Hillary
[01:25:25.400 --> 01:25:26.400]  was going to get in.
[01:25:26.400 --> 01:25:30.600]  They thought they were invincible and then they whipped themselves up into a fury into
[01:25:30.600 --> 01:25:35.680]  a frenzy believing they could stop Trump once he was president-elect and now a year later
[01:25:35.680 --> 01:25:37.280]  it is blowing up.
[01:25:37.280 --> 01:25:39.980]  I mean, I've never heard of anything like this in U.S. history.
[01:25:39.980 --> 01:25:47.840]  This is spectacular conspiracy and admitting they deleted thousands of text messages.
[01:25:47.840 --> 01:25:53.200]  Let's go to Bob Goodlat, hence DOJ may tap NSA for missing text.
[01:25:53.200 --> 01:25:56.360]  Oh yeah, they've all been recorded and the president's got all of them.
[01:25:56.360 --> 01:25:57.360]  That's why they know.
[01:25:57.360 --> 01:26:00.040]  They've just got to wait till it all comes out and then we'll go to this other clip.
[01:26:00.040 --> 01:26:01.040]  Here it is.
[01:26:01.040 --> 01:26:06.480]  Joe DeGeneres said on my radio show that the NSA has every text message, that we can get
[01:26:06.480 --> 01:26:09.600]  those text messages if need be.
[01:26:09.600 --> 01:26:12.160]  What do you know about that?
[01:26:12.160 --> 01:26:18.320]  We should search every place to find them because I think they still exist in some form somewhere.
[01:26:18.320 --> 01:26:21.800]  I'm pleased that Attorney General Sessions has made a commitment to investigate this
[01:26:21.800 --> 01:26:27.000]  and find them, but we should also undertake whether there is some way to gather them from
[01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:28.240]  some other source.
[01:26:28.240 --> 01:26:34.160]  It is very important, but even the text messages we have are alarming and the secret society
[01:26:34.160 --> 01:26:41.720]  just harks back to the text we saw before in December talking about the insurance policy.
[01:26:41.720 --> 01:26:44.800]  What has been going on in that five month period of time?
[01:26:44.800 --> 01:26:49.520]  Well we know one thing for sure and that is that these people hostile to the president
[01:26:49.520 --> 01:26:56.320]  have not been conducting themselves in a manner that befits the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
[01:26:56.320 --> 01:27:03.120]  They built this big giant illegal thing that records everything and we've got it from the
[01:27:03.120 --> 01:27:07.800]  WikiLeaks and the Vault 1 through 8 CIA leaks that came out last year.
[01:27:07.800 --> 01:27:10.760]  We know exactly how it works, the name of the program you name it.
[01:27:10.760 --> 01:27:13.760]  They go into their name, into their social security number.
[01:27:13.760 --> 01:27:19.920]  You enter that and then it goes in and even for the last six, seven years, everything
[01:27:19.920 --> 01:27:20.920]  is recorded.
[01:27:20.920 --> 01:27:25.000]  Before that it was just key people but still a lot of folks and I've seen some of the files
[01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:28.680]  we published with my name, Trump's name, where hundreds of thousands were being watched when
[01:27:28.680 --> 01:27:30.360]  Obama first got in.
[01:27:30.360 --> 01:27:36.920]  But that was just in that DEA data dump that Sheriff Arpaio got that he released the world.
[01:27:36.920 --> 01:27:41.640]  They go right into your file, just like you go into a computer file and then it's okay.
[01:27:41.640 --> 01:27:46.160]  He's got a Twitter, he's got a Facebook, he's got a YouTube, he's got his private email,
[01:27:46.160 --> 01:27:47.880]  he's got these cell phones.
[01:27:47.880 --> 01:27:50.480]  Let's see who he's associated with, his wife, his son, his daughter.
[01:27:50.480 --> 01:27:54.040]  They've all got cell phones and then they've got maps of who you talk to and you can just
[01:27:54.040 --> 01:27:59.680]  go right into all the voice mails, all the text messages, all the voice memos, all of
[01:27:59.680 --> 01:28:03.080]  the everything, the snapchats, everything.
[01:28:03.080 --> 01:28:07.880]  Because as that goes over the fiber, it's all caught at the big data centers and it's
[01:28:07.880 --> 01:28:11.560]  all recorded and it's all put into the record.
[01:28:11.560 --> 01:28:17.520]  So yes, everything these FBI agents did on burner phones is also recorded but they think
[01:28:17.520 --> 01:28:22.880]  that that's not gonna be nexused out because it's phones they bought at Walmart or whatever
[01:28:22.880 --> 01:28:27.960]  but still because the proximity and where they're at and all the rest of it, you could
[01:28:27.960 --> 01:28:32.240]  geo-locate a map about when those calls are made and where and overlay it and figure out
[01:28:32.240 --> 01:28:34.160]  who had the phones and who they were.
[01:28:34.160 --> 01:28:42.200]  But yeah, that's the best thing they've got is the burner phones but there's travel log
[01:28:42.200 --> 01:28:48.760]  proximity maps and predictive systems that know how you travel in your daily life and
[01:28:48.760 --> 01:28:50.960]  even the average FBI agent would know that till now.
[01:28:50.960 --> 01:28:56.400]  So they'll overlay that and have the entire data map fully recorded.
[01:28:56.400 --> 01:28:58.000]  Fully cooked, ready to eat bacon.
[01:28:58.000 --> 01:29:02.760]  I'm talking thick meaty, center cut, presidential bacon, savory and delicious.
[01:29:02.760 --> 01:29:03.760]  I buy some.
[01:29:03.760 --> 01:29:04.760]  I use some.
[01:29:04.760 --> 01:29:05.760]  I store some.
[01:29:05.760 --> 01:29:06.760]  Awesome.
[01:29:06.760 --> 01:29:11.880]  No refrigeration needed with a 10 year shelf life, NASA pack technology, bacon.
[01:29:11.880 --> 01:29:17.400]  Fully cooked, fully hydrated, ready to eat right from the pack bacon or warm and served.

[01:29:27.560 --> 01:29:29.080]  Do you owe the IRS money you can't pay?
[01:29:29.080 --> 01:29:30.640]  Are tax debts crippling you?
[01:29:30.640 --> 01:29:33.440]  I've defended people from the IRS for over 30 years.

[01:29:35.680 --> 01:29:39.480]  I wrote the book on IRS settlement and I'm telling you there's no such thing as a hopeless
[01:29:39.480 --> 01:29:40.480]  case.

[01:29:59.040 --> 01:30:00.040]  Go ahead.
[01:30:00.040 --> 01:30:02.360]  Oh, Alex, you can rent any day of the week.
[01:30:02.360 --> 01:30:06.000]  Thank you, sir, for doing what you do and being a patriot and doing your best to save
[01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:12.920]  America and encouraging us as fellow patriots to do that in our local areas as well.
[01:30:12.920 --> 01:30:19.200]  As a longtime InfoWars listener, I want to say thanks for the awesome BrainForce Anthroplex.
[01:30:19.200 --> 01:30:21.600]  My girlfriend would like to say thanks for the Anthroplex too.
[01:30:21.600 --> 01:30:22.600]  Thank you.
[01:30:22.600 --> 01:30:26.600]  I use the Biotru Selenium, the super blue toothpaste for you folks who aren't big normal
[01:30:26.600 --> 01:30:27.600]  toothpaste fans.
[01:30:27.600 --> 01:30:32.360]  The super blue is awesome and thank you so much, Alex, for the InfoWars Life products.
[01:30:32.360 --> 01:30:33.560]  They are quality.
[01:30:33.560 --> 01:30:38.200]  I can't wait to get some more and thank you so much for doing that for us to keep us healthy.
[01:30:38.200 --> 01:30:39.200]  Absolutely.
[01:30:39.200 --> 01:30:44.520]  Thank you because then we could all, as educated patriots, help our other countrymen and women
[01:30:44.520 --> 01:30:49.440]  understand that there's a bigger problems going on and if we can get our houses in order
[01:30:49.440 --> 01:30:58.920]  and be good to each other and ourselves, we can take our country back.
[01:30:58.920 --> 01:31:03.000]  Over a year in the making, produced by one of the top organic firms in the country, that
[01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:07.840]  if you want proven studies and documentation, I'm going to speak for hours just on the files
[01:31:07.840 --> 01:31:12.160]  I have here of what this is proven to do, the ingredients in this.
[01:31:12.160 --> 01:31:17.280]  This is the ultimate immune system boost for this time of year, any time of the year.
[01:31:17.280 --> 01:31:23.520]  But immune wall is incredible and folks, other formulas that aren't even as good are $70-80.
[01:31:23.520 --> 01:31:25.080]  It's a great deal at $39.
[01:31:25.080 --> 01:31:31.000]  Immune wall, beta-glucans, olive leaf, and so much more, it is concentrated.
[01:31:31.000 --> 01:31:36.160]  You need to go read what is in here, the mushroom blend of the most expensive, highest quality
[01:31:36.160 --> 01:31:41.320]  mushrooms that just incredibly accelerate, a citrus peel blend, I mean this is the next
[01:31:41.320 --> 01:31:42.320]  level.
[01:31:42.320 --> 01:31:45.760]  It's now available, ladies and gentlemen, immune wall, I think it's beyond seasonal,
[01:31:45.760 --> 01:31:48.320]  beta-glucan, olive leaf, and more.
[01:31:48.320 --> 01:31:56.880]  Immune wall, infowarsstore.com, infowarslife.com, or triple-eight, 2533139.
[01:31:56.880 --> 01:32:00.200]  Infowars Life is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine.
[01:32:00.200 --> 01:32:04.800]  We have found extraordinary new natural way to help alleviate seasonal distress symptoms
[01:32:04.800 --> 01:32:09.720]  including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort, and respiratory
[01:32:09.720 --> 01:32:11.760]  health and normal breathing.
[01:32:11.760 --> 01:32:12.760]  This is pollen blood.
[01:32:12.760 --> 01:32:18.120]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs from
[01:32:18.120 --> 01:32:24.280]  specific farms experienced less seasonal distress symptoms like runny nose, itchy watery eyes,
[01:32:24.280 --> 01:32:25.840]  and excessive mucus production.
[01:32:25.840 --> 01:32:30.640]  They began studying the effects in published trials, in their published trials.
[01:32:30.640 --> 01:32:36.760]  Now we are introducing the fruit of the research of fast-acting chewable tablets, just two tablets
[01:32:36.760 --> 01:32:41.560]  at the first sign of seasonal distress, and fast-acting pollen block starts working in
[01:32:41.560 --> 01:32:45.160]  about 15 minutes to help alleviate seasonal distress.
[01:32:45.160 --> 01:32:49.400]  Enjoy the air you breathe naturally with fast-acting pollen block, available now at
[01:32:49.400 --> 01:33:00.040]  infowarslife.com, or by calling till three, triple-eight, 2533139.
[01:33:00.040 --> 01:33:19.040]  We are listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:33:19.040 --> 01:33:36.920]  You know, we have a great team here at infowars, and I don't spend enough time thanking them
[01:33:36.920 --> 01:33:41.240]  for the great job they do, or how they think of all the different angles and things that
[01:33:41.240 --> 01:33:42.240]  I miss.
[01:33:42.240 --> 01:33:47.120]  But Darren McBreen remembered a clip, and if you can bring Darren in here, because he'll
[01:33:47.120 --> 01:33:53.120]  probably know the date, but this was when Trump was still running in memory serves, but
[01:33:53.120 --> 01:34:00.240]  he was the nominee, and they were going completely ape, and Newt Gennrich said something that
[01:34:00.240 --> 01:34:01.240]  was 100% true.
[01:34:01.240 --> 01:34:03.800]  That's what frustrates me about Newt Gennrich.
[01:34:03.800 --> 01:34:12.480]  He's ultra smart, ultra aware, incredible speaker, but he used to work for Nelson Rockefeller
[01:34:12.480 --> 01:34:17.280]  and others, and when the globalists want, he'll go along with them.
[01:34:17.280 --> 01:34:22.280]  Yeah, they found the article, March 4th, 2016, Gennrich Establishment Scared of Trump, because
[01:34:22.280 --> 01:34:25.720]  he didn't belong to the secret society.
[01:34:25.720 --> 01:34:29.400]  Darren remembered that he had said that, and see, I was right, it was back during the campaign.
[01:34:29.400 --> 01:34:32.320]  I guess he wasn't even the nominee yet.
[01:34:32.320 --> 01:34:37.600]  But the fact that Gennrich said that, I just had to provide, though, that you can't trust
[01:34:37.600 --> 01:34:42.680]  Gennrich, except when he's telling you the truth 98% of the time, it's some of the best
[01:34:42.680 --> 01:34:46.200]  info out there, but then occasionally he'll pull a little globalist stuff, but that's
[01:34:46.200 --> 01:34:47.200]  a side issue.
[01:34:47.200 --> 01:34:49.480]  I should have just got right to the meat potatoes.
[01:34:49.480 --> 01:34:54.160]  Darren remembered that, and that ties into all of this right now, because that's why the
[01:34:54.160 --> 01:34:55.880]  globalists don't like Trump.
[01:34:55.880 --> 01:34:58.200]  He is his own guy.
[01:34:58.200 --> 01:35:01.160]  He isn't a good old boy's club.
[01:35:01.160 --> 01:35:03.960]  When he's not hanging out with his family, he's hanging out with his wife, or if he's
[01:35:03.960 --> 01:35:10.880]  not married a woman, and he likes to hang out with blue collar workers, and eat hamburgers
[01:35:10.880 --> 01:35:13.080]  literally on his construction sites.
[01:35:13.080 --> 01:35:20.380]  And he's just a blue collar billionaire who is about sticking it to the elites.
[01:35:20.380 --> 01:35:22.000]  And he's never been in their club.
[01:35:22.000 --> 01:35:23.800]  He's never done it in their cabals.
[01:35:23.800 --> 01:35:26.320]  He's never joined their big groups.
[01:35:26.320 --> 01:35:30.560]  And he came out during the campaign and said, I've paid off all these people and it's legal,
[01:35:30.560 --> 01:35:31.560]  but it's wrong.
[01:35:31.560 --> 01:35:34.880]  I don't know how to turn things back on, they have been screwing the country over, these
[01:35:34.880 --> 01:35:38.240]  people are all bought and paid for, I'm an independent.
[01:35:38.240 --> 01:35:42.880]  I will take the controls off that have been screwing you.
[01:35:42.880 --> 01:35:48.320]  And Gennrich made that point back in March of a year and a half ago or longer.
[01:35:48.320 --> 01:35:50.600]  We should flashback that article and retweet it.
[01:35:50.600 --> 01:35:54.480]  Remember when Gennrich said Trump wasn't part of a secret society?
[01:35:54.480 --> 01:35:56.040]  Because that's the secret to Trump.
[01:35:56.040 --> 01:35:58.600]  He is his own guy.
[01:35:58.600 --> 01:35:59.600]  Does it mean he's perfect?
[01:35:59.600 --> 01:36:00.600]  No.
[01:36:00.600 --> 01:36:04.120]  Let me tell you something before I play this clip.
[01:36:04.120 --> 01:36:08.360]  The fact that they've gotten him to send major heavy weapons to the Russian border, they
[01:36:08.360 --> 01:36:10.800]  basically doubled what was there under Obama.
[01:36:10.800 --> 01:36:15.040]  And they put US special operations all over the Russian border and they're massing Marines
[01:36:15.040 --> 01:36:19.120]  and they've got the head of the Marine Corps close to the Russian border, saying there's
[01:36:19.120 --> 01:36:22.000]  300 Marines here today, there may be 3,000 next week.
[01:36:22.000 --> 01:36:26.600]  We're probably going to have a war with Russia.
[01:36:26.600 --> 01:36:31.680]  And that is all the neocons and the Democrats making this Russia thing up, desperate to keep
[01:36:31.680 --> 01:36:34.240]  us from getting all those Russian resources.
[01:36:34.240 --> 01:36:35.240]  Russia's perfect.
[01:36:35.240 --> 01:36:37.560]  They've got more resources than Africa.
[01:36:37.560 --> 01:36:41.080]  Russia has the most resources than Africa.
[01:36:41.080 --> 01:36:45.760]  Russia's a country, also basically two continents together and then you've got Eurasia and then
[01:36:45.760 --> 01:36:48.360]  of course you've got Africa that its own continent.
[01:36:48.360 --> 01:36:53.800]  But all the demographics, all the numbers, all the facts show, Russia needs the US.
[01:36:53.800 --> 01:36:54.960]  The US needs Russia.
[01:36:54.960 --> 01:36:57.720]  And they're questioning any communists now.
[01:36:57.720 --> 01:36:58.920]  I mean, I think they go too far.
[01:36:58.920 --> 01:37:03.000]  They basically arrest communists in Russia now and stuff, but he says they work for Soros
[01:37:03.000 --> 01:37:04.000]  and it's been proven.
[01:37:04.000 --> 01:37:08.600]  The point is, is that things are getting crazy.
[01:37:08.600 --> 01:37:14.680]  And Russia has been moving its supersonic missiles to the borders with Europe.
[01:37:14.680 --> 01:37:18.640]  They've been moving them up the border with North Korea and they've been saying, okay,
[01:37:18.640 --> 01:37:21.120]  we're ready to have a war, let's go.
[01:37:21.120 --> 01:37:28.360]  And it's such a travesty that the secret globalist societies, the good old boys, the
[01:37:28.360 --> 01:37:32.200]  sycophants, you know, Phil Mudd goes, you've disrespected our intelligence community.
[01:37:32.200 --> 01:37:34.600]  We're going to kill you.
[01:37:34.600 --> 01:37:38.200]  And Schumer, you mess with our intelligence agencies.
[01:37:38.200 --> 01:37:39.920]  They got seven ways to Sunday.
[01:37:39.920 --> 01:37:44.400]  You mean all the blue blood Ivy League leftists that have it out for the country that all
[01:37:44.400 --> 01:37:48.360]  wanted to be secret agents who all went and got your little CIA cards.
[01:37:48.360 --> 01:37:53.760]  They're embarrassing scum, all the people that actually do the killing and the tracking
[01:37:53.760 --> 01:38:00.680]  and the engaging and all the work hates you to a person.
[01:38:00.680 --> 01:38:06.960]  So it's also a besmirch of US intelligence agencies to actually say that Phil Mudd and
[01:38:06.960 --> 01:38:12.240]  other little chicken neck cowards like Chuckie Schumer represent them.
[01:38:12.240 --> 01:38:15.160]  And the point is our government leadership has been evil.
[01:38:15.160 --> 01:38:19.720]  Our intelligence agencies recognize that, but it's really up to we, the people.
[01:38:19.720 --> 01:38:23.680]  But if our own military and our own intelligence agencies are trying to get the face sucker
[01:38:23.680 --> 01:38:27.200]  off of us, the least the American people can do is join in and doing it.
[01:38:27.200 --> 01:38:28.200]  And you have done that.
[01:38:28.200 --> 01:38:30.800]  You're the reason we're here.
[01:38:30.800 --> 01:38:34.920]  And it's recognized by the president and others that in full wars was the computer program
[01:38:34.920 --> 01:38:41.200]  reboot operation to let us recognize we're under globalist control, foreign occupation,
[01:38:41.200 --> 01:38:45.160]  and that it was hurting us economically and how they use economics to control to launch
[01:38:45.160 --> 01:38:48.800]  the reboot first through our military and intelligence agencies.
[01:38:48.800 --> 01:38:52.320]  I mean, I could have in here from SEAL team six, you name it all up and tell you, they
[01:38:52.320 --> 01:38:58.680]  would get called in and told required viewing Alex Jones 10, 15 years ago.
[01:38:58.680 --> 01:39:00.480]  And it wasn't that I was that special.
[01:39:00.480 --> 01:39:05.040]  It's that I was the only person that actually read government documents and had those type
[01:39:05.040 --> 01:39:09.520]  of guests on who wasn't a leftist because the leftist obsessed with COG and government
[01:39:09.520 --> 01:39:12.240]  works because they want to run it and get into it.
[01:39:12.240 --> 01:39:14.320]  I just want to live here in Texas and be left alone.
[01:39:14.320 --> 01:39:18.600]  I don't want to be up there in the secret societies and the butt-pissing operations that I want
[01:39:18.600 --> 01:39:19.600]  to be left alone.
[01:39:19.600 --> 01:39:24.200]  Only reason I'm doing this is because I'm not going to be some globalist slave of Antifa
[01:39:24.200 --> 01:39:28.080]  and a bunch of pot bellies and a bunch of scum like Bernie Sanders who wants to run
[01:39:28.080 --> 01:39:29.080]  my life.
[01:39:29.080 --> 01:39:33.440]  It ain't happening, but I've kind of gone on a rant here.
[01:39:33.440 --> 01:39:38.160]  The point is, is that I'm glad that McBreen remembered this because this is the truth.
[01:39:38.160 --> 01:39:40.880]  Trump is not in a secret society.
[01:39:40.880 --> 01:39:44.600]  His society is going up on the stage and saying it's about you and your family.
[01:39:44.600 --> 01:39:45.680]  That's real value.
[01:39:45.680 --> 01:39:46.680]  You make the world work.
[01:39:46.680 --> 01:39:51.920]  I admire you and I'm going to get out of your way.
[01:39:51.920 --> 01:39:54.200]  Trump admires working families.
[01:39:54.200 --> 01:39:59.080]  Trump admires white people, black people, Hispanics, women, old, young.
[01:39:59.080 --> 01:40:01.280]  Trump admires hard-working, strong people.
[01:40:01.280 --> 01:40:02.360]  He's all about it.
[01:40:02.360 --> 01:40:03.440]  He's obsessed with it.
[01:40:03.440 --> 01:40:05.000]  He works 18 hours a day.
[01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:08.160]  They've gotten to cut back a little bit to like 14, thank God, because he was getting
[01:40:08.160 --> 01:40:09.960]  exhausted six months ago.
[01:40:09.960 --> 01:40:11.840]  He's real people.
[01:40:11.840 --> 01:40:14.080]  That's why the scum is so upset.
[01:40:14.080 --> 01:40:16.960]  They're crapping themselves.
[01:40:16.960 --> 01:40:19.200]  He was so real.
[01:40:19.200 --> 01:40:26.160]  Him and his dad played possum for decades while they were planning all this and waiting
[01:40:26.160 --> 01:40:27.160]  for the right time.
[01:40:27.160 --> 01:40:28.160]  And guess what?
[01:40:28.160 --> 01:40:29.160]  It happened.
[01:40:29.160 --> 01:40:33.600]  Again, his dad, I've confirmed from the highest levels, massive amounts of money in the John
[01:40:33.600 --> 01:40:37.480]  Birch society in the 50s and 60s.
[01:40:37.480 --> 01:40:39.680]  Same thing with people like Donald Trump.
[01:40:39.680 --> 01:40:44.120]  And I've talked to the old guys that have been in the meetings just two days ago with
[01:40:44.120 --> 01:40:47.720]  Trump, 25 years ago, saying, I wish somebody'd run to stop this.
[01:40:47.720 --> 01:40:48.720]  I'd get behind him.
[01:40:48.720 --> 01:40:49.720]  He didn't even want to.
[01:40:49.720 --> 01:40:55.240]  When he says that, he doesn't need to do that to feel powerful.
[01:40:55.240 --> 01:40:56.680]  He was looking for somebody to back.
[01:40:56.680 --> 01:40:58.440]  They never showed up.
[01:40:58.440 --> 01:41:00.760]  Just like he says in speeches, they never came along.
[01:41:00.760 --> 01:41:03.560]  I've talked to people that were in the meetings 25 years ago.
[01:41:03.560 --> 01:41:06.480]  When Trump was saying, who do we get to do this?
[01:41:06.480 --> 01:41:08.320]  Why are we doing this with napkin gap?
[01:41:08.320 --> 01:41:10.520]  Why are they out to get the country?
[01:41:10.520 --> 01:41:13.480]  He's not perfect, but he's not out to screw you.
[01:41:13.480 --> 01:41:16.720]  He doesn't have it out or America.
[01:41:16.720 --> 01:41:17.720]  You understand that?
[01:41:17.720 --> 01:41:18.720]  All right.
[01:41:18.720 --> 01:41:19.720]  Let's go to Newt Gendritch here.
[01:41:19.720 --> 01:41:22.480]  Let's go ahead and roll Newt Gendritch telling it like it is.
[01:41:22.480 --> 01:41:23.480]  Here it is.
[01:41:23.480 --> 01:41:27.840]  And now they're faced with a very real prospect of Donald Trump becoming the leader of the
[01:41:27.840 --> 01:41:30.800]  party and it absolutely drives them crazy.
[01:41:30.800 --> 01:41:32.760]  They just cannot imagine sharing.
[01:41:32.760 --> 01:41:34.320]  No, because he's an outsider.
[01:41:34.320 --> 01:41:35.320]  He's not them.
[01:41:35.320 --> 01:41:36.520]  He's not part of the club.
[01:41:36.520 --> 01:41:37.520]  He's uncontrollable.
[01:41:37.520 --> 01:41:40.560]  You know, he hasn't been through the initiation rights.
[01:41:40.560 --> 01:41:43.520]  He didn't belong to the secret society.
[01:41:43.520 --> 01:41:45.440]  And I think that they don't see him.
[01:41:45.440 --> 01:41:48.040]  They have no idea how to relate to him.
[01:41:48.040 --> 01:41:52.200]  That's right because they're not normal, good, honorable people.
[01:41:52.200 --> 01:41:55.640]  An alpha male that's strong and successful doesn't have to see you fail to feel powerful.
[01:41:55.640 --> 01:42:00.000]  In fact, when they see you fail as a good person, it hurts a real alpha male.
[01:42:00.000 --> 01:42:03.560]  And that's really what this is the return of, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:42:03.560 --> 01:42:06.520]  And that's why they're so scared and that's why they're crapping themselves.
[01:42:06.520 --> 01:42:07.520]  Is Trump perfect?
[01:42:07.520 --> 01:42:08.520]  No.
[01:42:08.520 --> 01:42:09.520]  Is he delivering perfectly?
[01:42:09.520 --> 01:42:10.520]  No.
[01:42:10.520 --> 01:42:11.520]  But is he trying as hard as he can?
[01:42:11.520 --> 01:42:12.520]  Absolutely.
[01:42:12.520 --> 01:42:13.520]  Newt Gendritch.
[01:42:13.520 --> 01:42:16.360]  Trump didn't belong to the secret societies.
[01:42:16.360 --> 01:42:17.360]  And you look at who did.
[01:42:17.360 --> 01:42:18.920]  People like Zuckerberg at Harvard.
[01:42:18.920 --> 01:42:19.920]  And I got to say it.
[01:42:19.920 --> 01:42:22.080]  Harvard is the cancer.
[01:42:22.080 --> 01:42:26.520]  People want to say, oh, it's Catholics, oh, it's Jews, oh, it's this or that.
[01:42:26.520 --> 01:42:30.480]  No, there's good Catholics, good Jews, good agnostics, good everything.
[01:42:30.480 --> 01:42:36.080]  They're basically Harvard, pinhead, want to be elitists who hate everybody and think they're
[01:42:36.080 --> 01:42:39.040]  better than everybody who want to be in the cool club.
[01:42:39.040 --> 01:42:42.240]  Just like Gerald Salenty always says, they're the white shoe boys that always wanted to
[01:42:42.240 --> 01:42:43.240]  be class president.
[01:42:43.240 --> 01:42:44.600]  That's who they are.
[01:42:44.600 --> 01:42:46.320]  And they hate you.
[01:42:46.320 --> 01:42:47.680]  They hate America.
[01:42:47.680 --> 01:42:48.940]  They hate Trump.
[01:42:48.940 --> 01:42:51.080]  They are the scum of the earth.
[01:42:51.080 --> 01:42:52.800]  Stay with us.
[01:42:52.800 --> 01:42:58.120]  Not a group you developed living defense for us.
[01:42:58.120 --> 01:42:59.520]  It took you over a year to do it.
[01:42:59.520 --> 01:43:01.240]  Why is this so good?
[01:43:01.240 --> 01:43:05.800]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[01:43:05.800 --> 01:43:10.560]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in
[01:43:10.560 --> 01:43:11.560]  my system.
[01:43:11.560 --> 01:43:16.800]  But right now we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful
[01:43:16.800 --> 01:43:22.080]  to your body that lives off a host mechanism right now with all the refugees spreading
[01:43:22.080 --> 01:43:23.320]  disease around.
[01:43:23.320 --> 01:43:25.960]  We have biological warfare going on everywhere.
[01:43:25.960 --> 01:43:26.960]  These are all parasites.
[01:43:26.960 --> 01:43:29.640]  Tell us about all the stuff that says there's so many things that are in it.
[01:43:29.640 --> 01:43:30.880]  You have the neem in there.
[01:43:30.880 --> 01:43:34.000]  You have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood.
[01:43:34.000 --> 01:43:37.400]  I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[01:43:37.400 --> 01:43:38.400]  All right.
[01:43:38.400 --> 01:43:40.400]  Well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[01:43:40.400 --> 01:43:41.600]  It just came back in yesterday.
[01:43:41.600 --> 01:43:42.600]  Living Defense, infowarslife.com.
[01:43:42.600 --> 01:43:47.280]  And folks, you can't lose full of stuff that's great for your body, period.
[01:43:47.280 --> 01:43:50.560]  And you support the broadcast, infowarslife.com.
[01:43:50.560 --> 01:43:52.800]  Thank you, Dr. Group, from the Global Healing Center.
[01:43:52.800 --> 01:43:56.000]  Thank you so much for all your work, sir, on this great product.
[01:43:56.000 --> 01:43:58.080]  Frank in North Carolina, thanks for holding so long.
[01:43:58.080 --> 01:43:59.080]  Go ahead.
[01:43:59.080 --> 01:44:00.840]  I just have to say something, man.
[01:44:00.840 --> 01:44:04.760]  It seems like every time I turn on your broadcast, you're bragging.
[01:44:04.760 --> 01:44:05.760]  It just gets old, man.
[01:44:05.760 --> 01:44:08.720]  I'm going to shut you down right now, okay?
[01:44:08.720 --> 01:44:10.960]  We're taking calls about your nomination.
[01:44:10.960 --> 01:44:15.080]  Do you understand they're having congressional hearings trying to shut us down?
[01:44:15.080 --> 01:44:18.360]  Do you understand I'm ringing the alarm?
[01:44:18.360 --> 01:44:20.800]  If that was happening to anybody else, I'd be freaked out.
[01:44:20.800 --> 01:44:23.360]  I mean, what's it going to take us being shut down?
[01:44:23.360 --> 01:44:24.360]  Is that what you want, Frank?
[01:44:24.360 --> 01:44:25.360]  You know what, Alex?
[01:44:25.360 --> 01:44:26.360]  I'll put him on pause again.

[01:44:33.800 --> 01:44:38.160]  As much begging as I do, we can barely pay the bills and grow in the face of this.
[01:44:38.160 --> 01:44:41.240]  I'm not going to just stop growth and let them start pushing us backwards.
[01:44:41.240 --> 01:44:42.240]  You understand?
[01:44:42.240 --> 01:44:43.400]  I need your help, Frank.

[01:47:00.960 --> 01:47:15.800]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:47:15.800 --> 01:47:16.800]  Welcome back.
[01:47:16.800 --> 01:47:17.800]  I'm your host Alex Jones.
[01:47:17.800 --> 01:47:20.160]  If you've just joined us, I'm going to hit some other news we haven't gotten to yet.
[01:47:20.160 --> 01:47:22.240]  Big earthquakes, economic news.
[01:47:22.240 --> 01:47:28.680]  We've got a guest joining us with one of our reporters from Switzerland covering the World
[01:47:28.680 --> 01:47:32.160]  Economic Forum, he's made some very interesting discoveries.
[01:47:32.160 --> 01:47:35.520]  Daniels has got an article going up in the next few minutes about it.
[01:47:35.520 --> 01:47:38.800]  Antifa is up on top of the frozen mountain in the middle of nowhere, financed by George
[01:47:38.800 --> 01:47:43.280]  Soros as usual, helicoptered in with their signs.
[01:47:43.280 --> 01:47:47.640]  But being a renomob, they're calling for socialism, not communism, like they normally do.
[01:47:47.640 --> 01:47:52.160]  And they're not calling for killing US cops, they're calling for global warming carbon
[01:47:52.160 --> 01:47:53.680]  taxes paid to them.
[01:47:53.680 --> 01:47:55.360]  In fact, it just went live.
[01:47:55.360 --> 01:48:00.000]  But Soros deploys Antifa at Davos.
[01:48:00.000 --> 01:48:07.040]  But Jack Pasobic is really a smart cookie and he started tweeting out on his Twitter
[01:48:07.040 --> 01:48:13.080]  the fact that Trump's not in a secret society, as Newt Gennrich said, but who is in a secret
[01:48:13.080 --> 01:48:14.080]  society?
[01:48:14.080 --> 01:48:19.520]  So we should create a whole meme about this, about, oh, the Clinton FBI crime syndicate,
[01:48:19.520 --> 01:48:21.600]  they're a secret society.
[01:48:21.600 --> 01:48:24.120]  And we can put on screen, John Podesta.
[01:48:24.120 --> 01:48:30.640]  Who's in a secret, spirit cookie, Alistair Crowley society.
[01:48:30.640 --> 01:48:34.760]  So did somebody say secret society?
[01:48:34.760 --> 01:48:40.240]  And you can have a, oh, Ravanovitch, who they say is like 70 something, but it's like a
[01:48:40.240 --> 01:48:49.400]  vampire, she looks like she's 40, they all worship her, did someone say secret society?
[01:48:49.400 --> 01:48:50.400]  We're not creepy.
[01:48:50.400 --> 01:48:57.000]  We just have vampire teeth and they say, sir, we'll have the blood, the semen and the breast
[01:48:57.000 --> 01:48:58.000]  milk.
[01:48:58.000 --> 01:48:59.000]  They're waiting for you.
[01:48:59.000 --> 01:49:00.000]  Oh, good.
[01:49:00.000 --> 01:49:05.160]  And sir, the entertainment will be waiting for you in the hot tub.
[01:49:05.160 --> 01:49:06.320]  Good.
[01:49:06.320 --> 01:49:12.080]  So that's what this all comes down to, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:49:12.080 --> 01:49:15.960]  It's all too rich, isn't it, my friends?
[01:49:15.960 --> 01:49:21.640]  Go to somebody say secret, again, here's Newt Gennrich back in March of 2016, pointing
[01:49:21.640 --> 01:49:25.760]  out that Trump's not part of the good old boy club.
[01:49:25.760 --> 01:49:29.760]  And now they're faced with a very real prospect of Donald Trump becoming the leader of the
[01:49:29.760 --> 01:49:32.720]  party and it absolutely drives him crazy.
[01:49:32.720 --> 01:49:36.200]  They just cannot imagine sharing, well, because he's an outsider.
[01:49:36.200 --> 01:49:37.200]  He's not them.
[01:49:37.200 --> 01:49:38.360]  He's not part of the club.
[01:49:38.360 --> 01:49:39.360]  He's uncontrollable.
[01:49:39.360 --> 01:49:42.440]  You know, he hasn't been through the initiation rights.
[01:49:42.440 --> 01:49:45.360]  He didn't belong to the secret society.
[01:49:45.360 --> 01:49:47.320]  And I think that they don't see him.
[01:49:47.320 --> 01:49:50.080]  They have no idea how to relate to him.
[01:49:50.080 --> 01:49:55.080]  But see, the globalists create their own little cabals, their own little cults to keep people
[01:49:55.080 --> 01:49:59.480]  on the reservation and control them so they'll do terrible things.
[01:49:59.480 --> 01:50:02.080]  I'm part of American society.
[01:50:02.080 --> 01:50:05.840]  I'm part of believing in the country and knowing free markets the way to go and knowing we're
[01:50:05.840 --> 01:50:09.600]  not perfect, but our history is illustrious and our high points are a lot better than
[01:50:09.600 --> 01:50:10.600]  our low points.
[01:50:10.600 --> 01:50:15.280]  And I want to make the country great and I don't want to bring it down.
[01:50:15.280 --> 01:50:18.640]  Although you go to college or public school, I mean, every college out there except a few
[01:50:18.640 --> 01:50:22.920]  Christian ones, they just demonize America like it's Satan's rear end.
[01:50:22.920 --> 01:50:28.480]  And they never criticize North Korea or Venezuela or all the other horrible disasters that
[01:50:28.480 --> 01:50:30.040]  are collectivism.
[01:50:30.040 --> 01:50:33.920]  They just harp and harp and harp and harp because they're the moral high ground.
[01:50:33.920 --> 01:50:34.920]  They're the good guys.
[01:50:34.920 --> 01:50:39.000]  Well, most Christians or libertarians or conservatives or just free market folks or
[01:50:39.000 --> 01:50:41.320]  classical liberals aren't about grandstandings.
[01:50:41.320 --> 01:50:44.000]  We just sit here and let them run the world.
[01:50:44.000 --> 01:50:46.040]  Now they want to ban us off the internet.
[01:50:46.040 --> 01:50:47.960]  Now they want to say we're Russian agents.
[01:50:47.960 --> 01:50:50.560]  Now they want to shut us up.
[01:50:50.560 --> 01:50:52.720]  So we're finding out we've got to do something.
[01:50:52.720 --> 01:50:53.800]  We've got to stand up.
[01:50:53.800 --> 01:50:57.760]  And so the sleeping giant is awake and they keep acting like we're still asleep.
[01:50:57.760 --> 01:51:03.520]  See, they thought we were always awake, but they had intimidated us.
[01:51:03.520 --> 01:51:08.280]  And now that we're awake, they keep trying to scare us and they never listened.
[01:51:08.280 --> 01:51:10.920]  Psychopaths, sociopaths, narcissists like this as well.
[01:51:10.920 --> 01:51:11.920]  They never listened.
[01:51:11.920 --> 01:51:14.440]  They just have their own program going on internally in their mind.
[01:51:14.440 --> 01:51:16.440]  So they always tell us that we're an echo chamber.
[01:51:16.440 --> 01:51:17.440]  Where were the echo chamber?
[01:51:17.440 --> 01:51:21.040]  Hand in your ass to you.
[01:51:21.040 --> 01:51:22.160]  I'm not an echo chamber.
[01:51:22.160 --> 01:51:23.160]  I listen to it.
[01:51:23.160 --> 01:51:24.160]  I watch it all.
[01:51:24.160 --> 01:51:27.640]  I really think through it.
[01:51:27.640 --> 01:51:31.480]  Like CNN came out with more than, it's like a hundred other publications.
[01:51:31.480 --> 01:51:32.480]  It's all over TV.
[01:51:32.480 --> 01:51:34.000]  I can't even keep track of it.
[01:51:34.000 --> 01:51:37.840]  They are so scared of Neil Strauss because he's had a whole bunch of number one New York
[01:51:37.840 --> 01:51:42.440]  Times bestselling books and a lot of them get turned into movies.
[01:51:42.440 --> 01:51:45.600]  And he wants to write this big book with me and I'm very happy.
[01:51:45.600 --> 01:51:46.600]  You know, he came.
[01:51:46.600 --> 01:51:50.560]  I met with him some and we hit it off and he said he's never seen it where he sent out
[01:51:50.560 --> 01:51:54.400]  the proposal and there's already folks wanting to publish it, but we sent the proposal out
[01:51:54.400 --> 01:51:56.920]  so, you know, get a nice bidding war going.
[01:51:56.920 --> 01:52:04.880]  And they tattled within 24 hours and CNN's like, well, we contacted United Artists that
[01:52:04.880 --> 01:52:05.880]  represents him.
[01:52:05.880 --> 01:52:09.280]  And, you know, they're saying they did this on their own and they're not going to be part
[01:52:09.280 --> 01:52:10.280]  of this.
[01:52:10.280 --> 01:52:16.000]  Ooh, they think it's cool to be on television saying we're going to ban Alex.
[01:52:16.000 --> 01:52:18.800]  We're not going to let him publish a book.
[01:52:18.800 --> 01:52:19.800]  Hey dummies.
[01:52:19.800 --> 01:52:25.800]  Just like you got Milo's book ban ended up selling twice as many.
[01:52:25.800 --> 01:52:27.240]  We already thought all that through.
[01:52:27.240 --> 01:52:31.800]  We don't just like you just arrogantly do something and then freak out when something
[01:52:31.800 --> 01:52:32.800]  happens.
[01:52:32.800 --> 01:52:39.680]  All through and I, I was never going to publish a book except for the fact that they'll said
[01:52:39.680 --> 01:52:44.960]  yes, but they're going to try to ban it and then he laid out his plan and they're, they're
[01:52:44.960 --> 01:52:46.720]  walking into it better than we even thought.
[01:52:46.720 --> 01:52:52.520]  So we, and then they can't help it to that they have to book them.
[01:52:52.520 --> 01:52:56.760]  This is killing a book before it ever got out of mommy.
[01:52:56.760 --> 01:53:01.960]  This is like a boarding a book and this is the new thing they did.
[01:53:01.960 --> 01:53:04.240]  The sabbages had a bunch of number one New York times.
[01:53:04.240 --> 01:53:07.040]  He writes one about China's influence over America.
[01:53:07.040 --> 01:53:08.200]  It made it to the publishing.
[01:53:08.200 --> 01:53:11.960]  They printed 100,000 of them and then they went, sorry, Mr. Savage will pay you.
[01:53:11.960 --> 01:53:12.960]  The Chinese don't like it.
[01:53:12.960 --> 01:53:16.320]  We're not going to ship it to the stores.
[01:53:16.320 --> 01:53:20.440]  The listeners are kind of like, oh, well, you know, the Chinese government says Michael
[01:53:20.440 --> 01:53:21.800]  Savage book can't come out.
[01:53:21.800 --> 01:53:24.200]  I mean, we're just kind of used to it all of us, aren't we?
[01:53:24.200 --> 01:53:28.120]  Because we don't whine, but this is outrageous.
[01:53:28.120 --> 01:53:33.840]  And now you, you know what, we're calling all the publishers and, and, and CNN says
[01:53:33.840 --> 01:53:36.960]  anybody publishes it will destroy you.
[01:53:36.960 --> 01:53:42.000]  I mean, what a knuckle dragon thug.
[01:53:42.000 --> 01:53:44.840]  Yeah, there it is.
[01:53:44.840 --> 01:53:47.040]  Michael Savage's China lobby censoring new book.
[01:53:47.040 --> 01:53:51.280]  I mean, wait till you experience this folks.
[01:53:51.280 --> 01:53:55.040]  I mean, I'm not liberated to get into it, but one reason I said I didn't want to be
[01:53:55.040 --> 01:54:01.600]  in big movies is about six, seven years ago, they wanted me to play this big leading role,
[01:54:01.600 --> 01:54:04.400]  a supporting role, but it was a big role, wasn't, wasn't the leader was a big supporting
[01:54:04.400 --> 01:54:07.720]  role in a big science fiction movie that came out.
[01:54:07.720 --> 01:54:10.200]  And I said, you know, there's a total, total payoff.
[01:54:10.200 --> 01:54:13.000]  I mean, you don't get, come on, Alex, you're a good actor and you'll be over here and
[01:54:13.000 --> 01:54:17.600]  I was like, yeah, and Hollywood cannot believe people that I just said no.
[01:54:17.600 --> 01:54:18.920]  And I said no to a bunch of it.
[01:54:18.920 --> 01:54:22.920]  It's, it's, it's fact, it's really, I don't kind of peacock around and get arrogant
[01:54:22.920 --> 01:54:27.320]  about stuff, but I love turning Hollywood down and all that stuff.
[01:54:27.320 --> 01:54:28.920]  It's, it's one of my second joining us.
[01:54:28.920 --> 01:54:30.320]  Everybody else falls over themselves.
[01:54:30.320 --> 01:54:33.000]  These politicians would, any of many, it's a joke.
[01:54:33.000 --> 01:54:36.120]  The real rock star thing to do is, you know, just burn them, baby.
[01:54:36.120 --> 01:54:39.520]  I can, you couldn't pay me enough to be part of what you do, but I'm sorry.
[01:54:39.520 --> 01:54:40.520]  I'm sorry.
[01:54:40.520 --> 01:54:45.760]  The point is, is that because it's not about the power, personal power, it's about these
[01:54:45.760 --> 01:54:53.520]  power worshipers not worshiping their God, not worshiping that big fact.
[01:54:53.520 --> 01:54:58.360]  If Hollywood was a creature, it'd be like a giant wart covered job of the hut child
[01:54:58.360 --> 01:55:02.800]  molester with pus pouring out of its eyes, with flies all over it in the middle of a
[01:55:02.800 --> 01:55:05.440]  giant junk heap for eternity.
[01:55:05.440 --> 01:55:08.120]  I don't want to have my spirit with that.
[01:55:08.120 --> 01:55:12.600]  So if I could metaphysically turn down huge amounts of money and turn down fame in the
[01:55:12.600 --> 01:55:15.040]  system, that's a ritual sacrifice.
[01:55:15.040 --> 01:55:20.400]  I mean, I'm not into magic, you know, as your little Kraliites are, that's all you trying
[01:55:20.400 --> 01:55:22.480]  to simulate what really goes on in the real world.
[01:55:22.480 --> 01:55:26.720]  But in front of God, it's a ritual to turn that down.
[01:55:26.720 --> 01:55:30.920]  You see, to not be part of Babylon and to want to try to build our own world here.
[01:55:30.920 --> 01:55:32.160]  That's what, that's what America is about.
[01:55:32.160 --> 01:55:37.200]  It's what, it's what this whole thing is about is doing new stuff, our own thing, where is
[01:55:37.200 --> 01:55:42.600]  it based on your sick secret societies, but where it's based on real brotherhood of man
[01:55:42.600 --> 01:55:47.640]  and humanity building the new future based on what individuals really stand for, not
[01:55:47.640 --> 01:55:51.520]  off what systems, artificial systems you shut up that we're supposed to all be imprisoned
[01:55:51.520 --> 01:55:52.680]  by.
[01:55:52.680 --> 01:55:55.360]  So that's a side issue.
[01:55:55.360 --> 01:56:00.480]  Speaking of that, though, we can't build this without capital to project the ideas and to
[01:56:00.480 --> 01:56:03.720]  defend the ideas from the enemy's attempts to shut it down.
[01:56:03.720 --> 01:56:07.480]  So I haven't even really plugged a day yet other than saying we have the CNN, this fake
[01:56:07.480 --> 01:56:11.720]  news t-shirts that a guy got thrown out of CNN Center, it's like a little mall by the
[01:56:11.720 --> 01:56:12.720]  convention center.
[01:56:12.720 --> 01:56:13.720]  They said you can't have that here.
[01:56:13.720 --> 01:56:14.720]  Just total authoritarians.
[01:56:14.720 --> 01:56:19.640]  You get those shirts that helps fill the operation that a lot of new supplements out our new
[01:56:19.640 --> 01:56:27.000]  pollen block from the quail, the Japanese quail that are fed a special diet.
[01:56:27.000 --> 01:56:29.920]  That's 51% off out of the gates, 1776.
[01:56:29.920 --> 01:56:30.920]  It really works.
[01:56:30.920 --> 01:56:32.240]  I'm amazed at how good it works.
[01:56:32.240 --> 01:56:36.880]  It knocks my seasonal discomfort caused by pollen down by about 80%.
[01:56:36.880 --> 01:56:38.400]  It's, it's some days 90.
[01:56:38.400 --> 01:56:42.480]  I say today it's about 80, which is the pollen just off the charts of Cedar and all the rest
[01:56:42.480 --> 01:56:43.480]  of us.
[01:56:43.480 --> 01:56:44.480]  Unbelievable right now.
[01:56:44.480 --> 01:56:49.280]  But infowarstore.com and we have a new product up there that's 50% off out of the gates,
[01:56:49.280 --> 01:56:56.520]  but I'm not even going to plug bodies, ultimate turmeric formula, whole body support because
[01:56:56.520 --> 01:56:59.840]  I don't have time to do it properly, but I'll just say this.
[01:56:59.840 --> 01:57:03.320]  This is the strongest, most concentrated turmeric.
[01:57:03.320 --> 01:57:07.640]  We looked at 10 leading competitors that cost even more money and their derivatives or their
[01:57:07.640 --> 01:57:09.880]  extracts and they're not even a fraction.
[01:57:09.880 --> 01:57:15.040]  This is 400 plus milligrams per serving of concentrated, fresh, high quality turmeric
[01:57:15.040 --> 01:57:19.560]  with a bunch of other organic compounds that are known to synergistically supercharge it.
[01:57:19.560 --> 01:57:24.760]  Everybody knows or you should know about turmeric, it's a 60 day supply, big order that's now
[01:57:24.760 --> 01:57:25.760]  available.
[01:57:25.760 --> 01:57:31.360]  Bodies, bodies, bodies, you look at the leading competitors, what they got in it versus us.
[01:57:31.360 --> 01:57:34.320]  That is, that is capsule size right there.
[01:57:34.320 --> 01:57:37.720]  And we just absolutely devastate the competition.
[01:57:37.720 --> 01:57:42.000]  We're not just tomorrow's news today, we're the highest quality supplements out there.
[01:57:42.000 --> 01:57:47.040]  infowarstore.com, help fund the victory against the globalist.

[01:58:47.440 --> 01:58:52.440]  Introducing Floor Life, the new probiotic line developed exclusively by InfoWarsLife
[01:58:52.440 --> 01:58:55.360]  after years of research on the human microbiome.
[01:58:55.360 --> 01:58:57.400]  Not all probiotics are made the same.
[01:58:57.400 --> 01:59:01.960]  Floor Life probiotics use a unique targeted delivery system that bypasses the stomach
[01:59:01.960 --> 01:59:06.080]  and releases directly into the intestines for maximum effect.
[01:59:06.080 --> 01:59:10.560]  This is critical because stomach acid kills most probiotics, so if you don't have a targeted
[01:59:10.560 --> 01:59:14.760]  delivery probiotic, then you're cheating your gut health and your wallet.
[01:59:14.760 --> 01:59:19.640]  Floor Life supports your body's core, where you need it most, including digestion, regularity,
[01:59:19.640 --> 01:59:22.080]  immunity, the gut lining and metabolism.
[01:59:22.080 --> 01:59:26.160]  Did you know that over 80% of your immune system is located in your gut?
[01:59:26.160 --> 01:59:27.160]  That's why.
[01:59:27.160 --> 01:59:30.840]  Having gut probiotic levels is so important for overall health.
[01:59:30.840 --> 01:59:35.480]  Floor Life is sold as a 15 billion probiotic for everyday maintenance care and a 50 billion
[01:59:35.480 --> 01:59:38.840]  probiotic for a 30 day advanced gut restoration program.
[01:59:38.840 --> 01:59:43.080]  Head to infowarslife.com to pick up your bottle of Floor Life probiotics today.
[01:59:43.080 --> 01:59:50.080]  That's infowarslife.com.
[01:59:50.080 --> 02:00:03.080]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[02:00:03.080 --> 02:00:09.320]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones coming to you live from the
[02:00:09.320 --> 02:00:11.520]  front lines of the info war.
[02:00:11.520 --> 02:00:15.760]  See, I wasn't as patient as Donald Trump.
[02:00:15.760 --> 02:00:21.680]  He created his real estate empire, then created his media empire, played possum all the whole
[02:00:21.680 --> 02:00:26.880]  time behind the scenes, preparing his move to try to overthrow the globalist.
[02:00:26.880 --> 02:00:31.720]  I just had to go directly to radio and television 20 plus years ago, and it came together like
[02:00:31.720 --> 02:00:37.200]  a horse in carriage with you, the listeners and viewers that are the heart of 1776.
[02:00:37.200 --> 02:00:38.720]  Dan Lyman is going to be joining us.
[02:00:38.720 --> 02:00:41.200]  We can show you some b-roll right now if you're a TV viewer.
[02:00:41.200 --> 02:00:43.840]  Some of the footage he shot in Switzerland at Debo's.
[02:00:43.840 --> 02:00:51.600]  Again, he's going to be joining us coming up in the next segment infowars.com reporter.
[02:00:51.600 --> 02:00:52.920]  Also, you guys might want to print it.
[02:00:52.920 --> 02:00:53.920]  I forgot to tell you.
[02:00:53.920 --> 02:00:59.240]  There's a new Kit Daniels article on infowars.com about Antifa Rats, always highly financed by
[02:00:59.240 --> 02:01:02.360]  their Lord Demon King Soros.
[02:01:02.360 --> 02:01:03.360]  They are also there.
[02:01:03.360 --> 02:01:08.640]  I mean, you've got the helicopters faring in, the rulers of the universe, the big tech
[02:01:08.640 --> 02:01:16.640]  companies, the Hollywood folks, who are there telling us that they are saviors of the earth
[02:01:16.640 --> 02:01:20.720]  and that you must let them run your entire life and control you or the earth will die,
[02:01:20.720 --> 02:01:24.320]  and that they are just total saviors.
[02:01:24.320 --> 02:01:27.280]  Like all these Hollywood movies that are coming out about, you know, where the daughter
[02:01:27.280 --> 02:01:32.480]  is marrying the cool tech owner, and he's really cool, and Bill and Linda Gates are
[02:01:32.480 --> 02:01:38.600]  helping, and this is truly sick, and there's all these old eugenicists, you know, sitting
[02:01:38.600 --> 02:01:43.880]  back, all these old eugenicists going, oh, let's get Bono.
[02:01:43.880 --> 02:01:45.480]  He's groovy and cool.
[02:01:45.480 --> 02:01:50.360]  Let him keep 99% of the African money just as long as he tells folks climate change so
[02:01:50.360 --> 02:01:55.760]  we can get that carbon tax in and kill about a billion people in the third world in the
[02:01:55.760 --> 02:01:57.000]  next few decades.
[02:01:57.000 --> 02:02:01.760]  But first, I want to play this clip since I mentioned it and didn't get to it.
[02:02:01.760 --> 02:02:08.240]  We've got a good lot getting into DOJ, may get NSA, missing text.
[02:02:08.240 --> 02:02:13.080]  We've got Senator Ron Johnston about the secret society and the criminal activity of the Clinton
[02:02:13.080 --> 02:02:20.240]  operas and the FBI, but we also have Terry Krushy, former senior FBI agent, who I want
[02:02:20.240 --> 02:02:25.320]  to get on the show, by the way, hashtag release the memo talking about just how incredible
[02:02:25.320 --> 02:02:30.360]  the activities of these people inside the FBI are.
[02:02:30.360 --> 02:02:33.160]  There's a lot of political dirty tricks going on here.
[02:02:33.160 --> 02:02:37.800]  I don't think this trail is going to stop at the door of the Russians.
[02:02:37.800 --> 02:02:42.720]  I think it's going to stop where the Democratic Party came through the door of the FBI.
[02:02:42.720 --> 02:02:45.840]  And I think this is Watergate Part 2.
[02:02:45.840 --> 02:02:48.480]  I think this is Hillary and Bill Clinton Part 2.
[02:02:48.480 --> 02:02:52.360]  We put up with all of this and the Clintons during my time in the FBI.
[02:02:52.360 --> 02:02:54.640]  And it was one scandal after another.
[02:02:54.640 --> 02:03:00.680]  And I think that if you look at past practices, remember what we always say, that the best
[02:03:00.680 --> 02:03:03.400]  predictor of future behavior is past behavior.
[02:03:03.400 --> 02:03:08.000]  This is all way to looking like the things I saw when I was there.
[02:03:08.000 --> 02:03:09.000]  That's right.
[02:03:09.000 --> 02:03:10.000]  That's so powerful.
[02:03:10.000 --> 02:03:12.120]  Let's play as we have time before we go to break.
[02:03:12.120 --> 02:03:16.280]  Senator Ron Johnson, I don't know what he had to say before we go to break, because what
[02:03:16.280 --> 02:03:17.280]  they're saying is true.
[02:03:17.280 --> 02:03:18.280]  This isn't high.
[02:03:18.280 --> 02:03:19.680]  In fact, it's worse than what they're saying.
[02:03:19.680 --> 02:03:24.760]  But the fact that this is coming out, it's recognized they've gone too far.
[02:03:24.760 --> 02:03:26.080]  They've got to be prosecuted.
[02:03:26.080 --> 02:03:30.160]  I understand not poking the bear and letting them go into abstention, keeping their billions
[02:03:30.160 --> 02:03:34.320]  of stolen Haitian money and Russian money, the Clintons.
[02:03:34.320 --> 02:03:37.480]  But they're not going to go away.
[02:03:37.480 --> 02:03:40.040]  So that's what it comes down to.
[02:03:40.040 --> 02:03:41.040]  Here it is.
[02:03:41.040 --> 02:03:47.120]  What this is all about is further evidence of corruption, more than bias, but corruption
[02:03:47.120 --> 02:03:50.720]  at the highest levels of the FBI in that secret society.
[02:03:50.720 --> 02:03:54.880]  We have an informant that's talking about a group that we're holding secret meetings
[02:03:54.880 --> 02:03:55.880]  offsite.
[02:03:55.880 --> 02:03:57.960]  There's so much smoke here.
[02:03:57.960 --> 02:03:58.960]  There's so much suspicion.
[02:03:58.960 --> 02:04:04.880]  Let's stop there, a secret society, secret meetings offsite of the Justice Department.
[02:04:04.880 --> 02:04:06.960]  And you have an informant saying that.
[02:04:06.960 --> 02:04:08.440]  Yes.
[02:04:08.440 --> 02:04:09.800]  Is there anything more about that?
[02:04:09.800 --> 02:04:12.200]  No, we have to dig into it.
[02:04:12.200 --> 02:04:13.680]  This is not a distraction.
[02:04:13.680 --> 02:04:19.280]  Again, this is bias, potentially corruption at the highest levels of the FBI that is now
[02:04:19.280 --> 02:04:20.280]  investigating.
[02:04:20.280 --> 02:04:25.280]  And by the way, Robert Mueller used to run the FBI.
[02:04:25.280 --> 02:04:29.800]  He is in no position to do an investigation over this kind of misconduct.
[02:04:29.800 --> 02:04:33.240]  So I think at this point in time, we probably should be looking at a special counsel to
[02:04:33.240 --> 02:04:36.760]  undertake this investigation, but Congress is going to have to continue to dig.
[02:04:36.760 --> 02:04:37.760]  Yeah, that's not enough.
[02:04:37.760 --> 02:04:39.360]  They've got to be indicted now.
[02:04:39.360 --> 02:04:43.560]  These are clear and present cabal of organized crime that infiltrated our government, that
[02:04:43.560 --> 02:04:46.640]  want to overthrow it for the Communist Chinese and their foreign powers.
[02:04:46.640 --> 02:04:47.640]  They're accusing us of that.
[02:04:47.640 --> 02:04:48.640]  They're all on the payroll.
[02:04:48.640 --> 02:04:50.400]  He didn't just used to run it.
[02:04:50.400 --> 02:04:52.920]  Him and Comey brought this whole nest of crooks in.
[02:04:52.920 --> 02:04:59.080]  That's all their little babies introducing cell force by info wars life.
[02:04:59.080 --> 02:05:03.520]  Cell force focuses on mitochondria efficiency and protection.
[02:05:03.520 --> 02:05:06.280]  Mitochondria produce over 95% of your energy.
[02:05:06.280 --> 02:05:09.280]  They are your body's cellular engines.
[02:05:09.280 --> 02:05:13.600]  Cell force helps promote your cellular energy production by supporting mitochondria, much
[02:05:13.600 --> 02:05:16.060]  like a cellular engine overhaul.
[02:05:16.060 --> 02:05:20.560]  Because when your mitochondria don't run at 100% efficiency, then they start producing
[02:05:20.560 --> 02:05:23.000]  reactive oxygen species.
[02:05:23.000 --> 02:05:28.200]  Top scientists agree that aging is most likely caused by cellular damage, resulting from
[02:05:28.200 --> 02:05:31.080]  these reactive oxygen species.
[02:05:31.080 --> 02:05:36.120]  The antioxidants found in cell force are some of the most powerful available on the market.
[02:05:36.120 --> 02:05:40.960]  The stronger the antioxidant, the better its ability to scavenge for these reactive oxygen
[02:05:40.960 --> 02:05:43.800]  species and other free radicals.
[02:05:43.800 --> 02:05:48.760]  Boost, protect and adapt with cell force from info wars life.
[02:05:48.760 --> 02:05:55.760]  Head to infowarslife.com or call 1-888-253-3139.
[02:06:18.760 --> 02:06:28.160]  All right, Dan Lyman has been doing work for info wars for a few years.
[02:06:28.160 --> 02:06:29.160]  Great reporter.
[02:06:29.160 --> 02:06:30.160]  Very prolific.
[02:06:30.160 --> 02:06:35.120]  A Twitter at Citizen Analyst, Facebook at Citizen Analyst as well.
[02:06:35.120 --> 02:06:39.080]  He's an American writer, political analyst and cultural commentator after years, fronting
[02:06:39.080 --> 02:06:40.080]  a rock band.
[02:06:40.080 --> 02:06:43.400]  He answered the call to treat journalism in defense of western civilization.
[02:06:43.400 --> 02:06:49.360]  He now serves as foreign correspondent in Switzerland for info wars and I was thinking
[02:06:49.360 --> 02:06:55.240]  we got to send a crew, but man, budgetarily that's expensive and I went, Dan Lyman.
[02:06:55.240 --> 02:06:58.800]  The great kid Daniel said Dan Lyman and I'm like, of course, Dan Lyman is amazing.
[02:06:58.800 --> 02:07:02.960]  We just need to get him a crew or something in the future because he's one manning it
[02:07:02.960 --> 02:07:03.960]  right now.
[02:07:03.960 --> 02:07:07.960]  But he's part of the great team and again, all reason I say that is because our team
[02:07:07.960 --> 02:07:08.960]  is everything.
[02:07:08.960 --> 02:07:12.720]  I just want to talk about the great team we've been forming, we've been expanding, we've
[02:07:12.720 --> 02:07:20.520]  upped it more than 10 full time writer reporters, three or four new TV reporters just last year.
[02:07:20.520 --> 02:07:24.360]  I want to double that the next year, but again, it's all up to you, the listeners and you've
[02:07:24.360 --> 02:07:25.360]  built it.
[02:07:25.360 --> 02:07:26.360]  I thank you.
[02:07:26.360 --> 02:07:27.960]  I'm just saying we grow as you want us to grow.
[02:07:27.960 --> 02:07:28.960]  You are the info war.
[02:07:28.960 --> 02:07:29.960]  You are the resistance.
[02:07:29.960 --> 02:07:30.960]  So Dan's there.
[02:07:30.960 --> 02:07:31.960]  Daniel says an article.
[02:07:31.960 --> 02:07:32.960]  He worked on with him.
[02:07:32.960 --> 02:07:33.960]  He's got some video of this.
[02:07:33.960 --> 02:07:34.960]  TV viewers can see.
[02:07:34.960 --> 02:07:41.160]  Soros deploys anti-foot devos, anti-foot parents establishment talking points outside the meeting
[02:07:41.160 --> 02:07:47.040]  and there's video of that again, up on info wars.com and prisonplanet.com right now.
[02:07:47.040 --> 02:07:51.840]  So let's just get Dan Lyman's take on what he's witnessed as somebody that lives in Switzerland
[02:07:51.840 --> 02:07:55.720]  but going to this very remote area where the globalists go to be away from everybody.
[02:07:55.720 --> 02:08:01.160]  I've got articles here where even top Silicon Valley folks are saying world must wake up
[02:08:01.160 --> 02:08:03.240]  the threat from tech giants.
[02:08:03.240 --> 02:08:06.280]  That's the one in Telegraph and their authoritarianism.
[02:08:06.280 --> 02:08:10.360]  And of course we've seen press releases from Davos admitting their global government is
[02:08:10.360 --> 02:08:11.360]  in trouble.
[02:08:11.360 --> 02:08:16.560]  So what's the mood there as it kicks off with Trump's set to speak there tomorrow?
[02:08:16.560 --> 02:08:17.560]  Dan?
[02:08:17.560 --> 02:08:18.560]  Hello, Alex.
[02:08:18.560 --> 02:08:19.560]  Good to be with you tonight.
[02:08:19.560 --> 02:08:21.480]  Thanks for joining us.
[02:08:21.480 --> 02:08:23.520]  So what's your first approximation?
[02:08:23.520 --> 02:08:28.360]  Well, so far it's been uneventful on the outside.
[02:08:28.360 --> 02:08:31.600]  It's a very low key crowd outside.
[02:08:31.600 --> 02:08:36.520]  Basically you see a lot of media personalities, tourists, just the standard ski crowd outside
[02:08:36.520 --> 02:08:40.440]  of the kind of the conference center area and the media area.
[02:08:40.440 --> 02:08:46.080]  But today I did a little bit more exploring up on the hill, which is back behind the center.
[02:08:46.080 --> 02:08:50.520]  And I did find that Antifa house, which I found pretty surprising as I had not encountered
[02:08:50.520 --> 02:08:53.120]  any activists or protesters yet.
[02:08:53.120 --> 02:08:57.320]  But what's interesting about this house is its proximity to the venue.
[02:08:57.320 --> 02:09:01.600]  And also it's basically on a bend in the road where a lot of media personalities are walking
[02:09:01.600 --> 02:09:02.600]  through.
[02:09:02.600 --> 02:09:06.000]  There's a lot of cameras there, a lot of TV broadcasting trucks.
[02:09:06.000 --> 02:09:09.280]  So it's very prominently displayed to these people there.
[02:09:09.280 --> 02:09:14.800]  And what's also interesting is that for someone to have access to that many balconies in Switzerland,
[02:09:14.800 --> 02:09:18.920]  they either own the house or they rent the whole thing or they've rented it out for the
[02:09:18.920 --> 02:09:22.000]  entire week, which would be incredibly expensive.
[02:09:22.000 --> 02:09:26.400]  So I do have my suspicions as to how they had access to all those balconies to hang
[02:09:26.400 --> 02:09:27.400]  the propaganda.
[02:09:27.400 --> 02:09:31.640]  Well, look, we know Soros funds that he's got billions of stolen dollars as a Nazi collaborator
[02:09:31.640 --> 02:09:33.120]  and all of his other criminal activities.
[02:09:33.120 --> 02:09:37.720]  But really, it's just you there reporting on what locals think on, you know, when Trump
[02:09:37.720 --> 02:09:41.360]  comes in, what locals think, we can read the press releases put out by the globalists
[02:09:41.360 --> 02:09:44.960]  that are up there taking drugs and having sex with, you know, all their different prostitutes.
[02:09:44.960 --> 02:09:47.840]  I mean, we know what goes on there.
[02:09:47.840 --> 02:09:51.720]  And of course, we had the former board member of Davos on just yesterday, Ted Malin, should
[02:09:51.720 --> 02:09:53.360]  be reporting on it as well.
[02:09:53.360 --> 02:09:58.400]  And he said that they're really panicking that they're really in decline right now.
[02:09:58.400 --> 02:09:59.400]  Very true.
[02:09:59.400 --> 02:10:04.520]  And I also saw that Macron, he spoke earlier today, and from the inside, he said that globalism
[02:10:04.520 --> 02:10:06.080]  is in crisis.
[02:10:06.080 --> 02:10:12.160]  There's no question that the theme of this entire confab this year is basically anti-Trump.
[02:10:12.160 --> 02:10:17.880]  So I think it's fantastic that he has the brass to show up there and just lay down the
[02:10:17.880 --> 02:10:18.880]  law.
[02:10:18.880 --> 02:10:19.880]  It looks like tomorrow.
[02:10:19.880 --> 02:10:24.080]  Well, there's so many angles to this, a lot of undercover stuff you can obviously do too.
[02:10:24.080 --> 02:10:27.640]  If you can find anti-fun with bars, they're in and what they're saying, what they're doing,
[02:10:27.640 --> 02:10:32.320]  they're just paying them, but again, these are the big billionaires that try to get all
[02:10:32.320 --> 02:10:37.480]  the world leaders in line to really try to set up their own secret society-style cabal
[02:10:37.480 --> 02:10:40.280]  like we've been hearing about inside the FBI.
[02:10:40.280 --> 02:10:41.280]  Correct.
[02:10:41.280 --> 02:10:43.920]  There's no question about it.
[02:10:43.920 --> 02:10:47.520]  And that's why I think this visit from Trump is going to be so interesting.
[02:10:47.520 --> 02:10:48.680]  He does arrive tomorrow.
[02:10:48.680 --> 02:10:54.960]  I think he's scheduled to have a private dinner with a bunch of European CEOs if I'm not mistaken.
[02:10:54.960 --> 02:10:59.440]  I could see definitely with the way things are going in the U.S. with the corporate tax
[02:10:59.440 --> 02:11:03.160]  cuts and just the general prosperity that seems to be taking hold.
[02:11:03.160 --> 02:11:07.680]  I wouldn't be surprised if he starts sucking a little business our way out there.
[02:11:07.680 --> 02:11:09.880]  And it definitely seems feasible.
[02:11:09.880 --> 02:11:14.320]  And I think that that will add an added element of suspense to the entire event.
[02:11:14.320 --> 02:11:18.200]  Well, since you say that, I don't know if you've talked to somebody that gave you inside
[02:11:18.200 --> 02:11:22.960]  info, but that's the word, the media tried to spin it, oh, he's going to sell out to
[02:11:22.960 --> 02:11:23.960]  the establishment.
[02:11:23.960 --> 02:11:27.880]  First, the establishment didn't exist a few years ago, the media told us, the corporate
[02:11:27.880 --> 02:11:28.880]  media.
[02:11:28.880 --> 02:11:32.640]  Now, now it exists and Trump's selling out to it.
[02:11:32.640 --> 02:11:34.880]  No, he's not just doing a victory lap.
[02:11:34.880 --> 02:11:38.680]  He's not just doing a up the keister maneuver.
[02:11:38.680 --> 02:11:43.840]  He is going like he always does to go, come on guys, globalism, getting together, being
[02:11:43.840 --> 02:11:47.640]  managed, going in and screwing countries over, playing nations off against each other.
[02:11:47.640 --> 02:11:48.960]  That's not the way to go.
[02:11:48.960 --> 02:11:54.480]  Come to America, just like Lee Cook of Apple just announced $350 billion dollars to be
[02:11:54.480 --> 02:12:00.240]  spent here in the next year, just like Japan, South Korea all announcing, he's their cheerleading
[02:12:00.240 --> 02:12:02.760]  for America, like he said he would do.
[02:12:02.760 --> 02:12:08.440]  And he's going to break off those meetings, dominate with a star appeal and his momentum
[02:12:08.440 --> 02:12:10.480]  and basically break up Davos.
[02:12:10.480 --> 02:12:14.960]  So I wasn't going to say it, but you kind of pre-looted it.
[02:12:14.960 --> 02:12:22.600]  This is, or foreshadowed it, this is, Trump is going to literally break up Davos and their
[02:12:22.600 --> 02:12:26.760]  fools to invite him in because he wouldn't even send, remember, when he was president
[02:12:26.760 --> 02:12:31.120]  of elect or just got in last year, he sent like Cartelucci there.
[02:12:31.120 --> 02:12:33.720]  So he kind of dissed him last year with a backhand.
[02:12:33.720 --> 02:12:37.080]  This year he's going in there to blow it sky high.
[02:12:37.080 --> 02:12:40.520]  And I kind of hold back my news because I want to make sure he gets in there and everything,
[02:12:40.520 --> 02:12:42.320]  but they're so arrogant, they're not going to listen to me.
[02:12:42.320 --> 02:12:45.560]  The point is, is I can now tell you he's going in to blow up the Death Star.
[02:12:45.560 --> 02:12:47.680]  So that's pretty exciting.
[02:12:47.680 --> 02:12:48.680]  It is definitely.
[02:12:48.680 --> 02:12:53.760]  And I think there's an added element of Providence, some delicious irony, the fact that Trump
[02:12:53.760 --> 02:12:56.640]  pulled us out of the Paris climate treaty.
[02:12:56.640 --> 02:13:00.760]  And then like on cue this weekend, we were just dumped on with snow.
[02:13:00.760 --> 02:13:04.800]  There was nearly six feet of snow that fell in this region up in the mountains and on
[02:13:04.800 --> 02:13:05.800]  the ground.
[02:13:05.800 --> 02:13:08.280]  I mean, you can't walk anywhere that hasn't been pre-cleared for you.
[02:13:08.280 --> 02:13:13.480]  I ended up falling into a snow hole just drifting off the beaten path just briefly.
[02:13:13.480 --> 02:13:14.880]  There is a lot of snow on the ground.
[02:13:14.880 --> 02:13:17.160]  The helipad was shut down for a while.
[02:13:17.160 --> 02:13:22.240]  The traffic coming in and out of town is monstrous because a lot of these people who would normally
[02:13:22.240 --> 02:13:28.120]  get ferried in by helicopter now have to take in these vans, these private limousines.
[02:13:28.120 --> 02:13:29.920]  So it's quite a sight to behold.
[02:13:29.920 --> 02:13:33.840]  And it's almost like the Trump incursor struck Davos already.
[02:13:33.840 --> 02:13:34.840]  That's right.
[02:13:34.840 --> 02:13:37.680]  And again, they want to be up the top of a mountain like Mont Blanc.
[02:13:37.680 --> 02:13:39.120]  They want to be on top of it.
[02:13:39.120 --> 02:13:43.680]  But Trump is going to Davos to politically destroy it, to politically blow it up, to
[02:13:43.680 --> 02:13:49.280]  break it up while it's on its knees and bring that cabal that's there trying to destroy
[02:13:49.280 --> 02:13:51.960]  nation states to heal.
[02:13:51.960 --> 02:13:56.560]  And he'll give them quarter and invite them back into the U.S. Republic as a devastating
[02:13:56.560 --> 02:13:58.240]  victory against the EU.
[02:13:58.240 --> 02:13:59.240]  That's the inside baseball.
[02:13:59.240 --> 02:14:07.200]  Because he sent Scaramucci, again, an underling with not a lot of power at that time, into
[02:14:07.200 --> 02:14:12.960]  the situation just to surveil it and to reconnoiter the situation.
[02:14:12.960 --> 02:14:18.160]  But now he himself is going to plant his sword in the heart of the dragon.
[02:14:18.160 --> 02:14:20.800]  I think this is going to be spectacular.
[02:14:20.800 --> 02:14:21.800]  I do too.
[02:14:21.800 --> 02:14:23.520]  I think even the entrance will be spectacular.
[02:14:23.520 --> 02:14:28.360]  There are only two, if not one, tiny little two-lane roads that come in and out of Davos.
[02:14:28.360 --> 02:14:30.920]  So I'm not sure how they're even going to get them there.
[02:14:30.920 --> 02:14:32.800]  It's been very private.
[02:14:32.800 --> 02:14:36.560]  However they're ferrying these people to and from, they can park them underground.
[02:14:36.560 --> 02:14:41.720]  So the possibility of kind of filming someone exiting a vehicle or even pulling in is quite
[02:14:41.720 --> 02:14:42.720]  slim.
[02:14:42.720 --> 02:14:43.720]  Security is very tight.
[02:14:43.720 --> 02:14:46.800]  I've tried to get some footage of the front of the building, which I've managed to get
[02:14:46.800 --> 02:14:47.800]  a little bit.
[02:14:47.800 --> 02:14:52.200]  But even filming from across the street on private property, I was yelled at by security
[02:14:52.200 --> 02:14:53.920]  and police to put the camera away.
[02:14:53.920 --> 02:14:56.280]  So as you can imagine, it is very tight.
[02:14:56.280 --> 02:15:00.920]  There are Swiss military helicopters flying around at all times above and hovering and
[02:15:00.920 --> 02:15:02.600]  just kind of keeping an eye on everything.
[02:15:02.600 --> 02:15:06.760]  So however the president comes in, if he's coming in, in the beast or something else,
[02:15:06.760 --> 02:15:09.200]  it's going to be spectacular to behold.
[02:15:09.200 --> 02:15:14.240]  And again, I would go talk to the Swiss police and go, look, man, I'm in full wars.
[02:15:14.240 --> 02:15:15.240]  You know who we are.
[02:15:15.240 --> 02:15:16.240]  We've been there before.
[02:15:16.240 --> 02:15:17.240]  They know who we are.
[02:15:17.240 --> 02:15:20.600]  And just I'm pressed so that, you know, I mean, you know what you're doing, but I wouldn't
[02:15:20.600 --> 02:15:21.600]  act paranoid around them.
[02:15:21.600 --> 02:15:25.560]  I just, I just go up and say, look, we're not showing your security procedures.
[02:15:25.560 --> 02:15:26.560]  We're just like everybody else.
[02:15:26.560 --> 02:15:30.080]  This idea that, you know, I'm sorry we have more viewers than the CIA in the U.S.
[02:15:30.080 --> 02:15:34.520]  I mean, I know if we were a discredited whore operation, you know, we would be cool, but
[02:15:34.520 --> 02:15:35.520]  just absolutely.
[02:15:35.520 --> 02:15:36.520]  All right.
[02:15:36.520 --> 02:15:43.800]  Dan Lyman is there up atop the mountain in the middle of the Swiss Alps for our big
[02:15:43.800 --> 02:15:44.800]  victory lap.
[02:15:44.800 --> 02:15:47.800]  But more than that, Trump just doesn't do factory laps.
[02:15:47.800 --> 02:15:52.240]  He's going in there to bring back the spoils and bring back the booty of the collapsing
[02:15:52.240 --> 02:15:53.240]  EU.
[02:15:53.240 --> 02:15:54.240]  Stay with us.
[02:15:54.240 --> 02:15:59.080]  Here's a special message for those of you who owe the IRS at least 10,000 or more in
[02:15:59.080 --> 02:16:00.240]  back taxes.
[02:16:00.240 --> 02:16:04.840]  The IRS has special programs in place that could eliminate or reduce your tax debt by
[02:16:04.840 --> 02:16:06.480]  thousands of dollars.
[02:16:06.480 --> 02:16:12.880]  Call the federal tax management helpline that has been set up for you, 800-503-8625.
[02:16:12.880 --> 02:16:16.080]  Stop the wage garnishments, levies, and tax liens now.
[02:16:16.080 --> 02:16:19.880]  Once you've qualified and enrolled, the IRS will stop all the collection activities
[02:16:19.880 --> 02:16:20.880]  against you.
[02:16:20.880 --> 02:16:24.760]  These unique programs have been allocated to help the economy and significantly reduce
[02:16:24.760 --> 02:16:26.920]  or eliminate your tax burden.

[02:21:15.380 --> 02:21:16.380]  people from here.
[02:21:16.380 --> 02:21:21.700]  And then he's like, we got Dan Lyman in Switzerland and he lives in Switzerland with his wife
[02:21:21.700 --> 02:21:22.700]  and family.
[02:21:22.700 --> 02:21:27.540]  And he does a great job for infowars.com, Twitter at Citizen Analyst.
[02:21:27.540 --> 02:21:31.140]  And again, if he has trouble getting us info through when the internet goes up and down
[02:21:31.140 --> 02:21:35.300]  because of the thousands of people that are there, he'll be able to still post at Citizen
[02:21:35.300 --> 02:21:40.620]  Analyst on Twitter, so be sure and follow that at Citizen Analyst on Facebook.
[02:21:40.620 --> 02:21:44.540]  I'm gonna let you get back to Trump's arrival tomorrow and interviewing the locals, everything
[02:21:44.540 --> 02:21:45.540]  else you're doing.
[02:21:45.540 --> 02:21:53.740]  We'll follow at infowars.com, Dan, but I talked to folks about what Trump is planning.
[02:21:53.740 --> 02:21:59.540]  One particular individual talked to Trump about four days ago and a lot of this information
[02:21:59.540 --> 02:22:06.380]  I get, I tend to not want to put on air just because I want the main mission to take place.
[02:22:06.380 --> 02:22:12.980]  But while you were talking, I just figured, they figured it out already what he's doing.
[02:22:12.980 --> 02:22:16.420]  So I shouldn't always just hold back and then not get the big scoops.
[02:22:16.420 --> 02:22:22.820]  But Trump told an individual I talked to that, I'm not gonna quote him exactly, but he just
[02:22:22.820 --> 02:22:27.660]  said, I'm gonna go up there, those people are on their last legs and I'm gonna tell
[02:22:27.660 --> 02:22:32.860]  them how to cowate the cabbage and I'm gonna bring back a lot of new factories and new
[02:22:32.860 --> 02:22:34.060]  industry in the United States.
[02:22:34.060 --> 02:22:38.380]  I'm gonna go in there and out negotiate these guys and these guys are a bunch of amateurs
[02:22:38.380 --> 02:22:44.260]  and they're a bunch of idiots and the EU are a bunch of idiots and a bunch of authoritarians
[02:22:44.260 --> 02:22:49.060]  and he is going to relish eating their lunch.
[02:22:49.060 --> 02:22:50.060]  No question.
[02:22:50.060 --> 02:22:52.940]  There was an interesting article a couple of days ago that drudging to the headline
[02:22:52.940 --> 02:22:58.820]  it was the New York Times, Fox in the Henhouse, Trump goes to the globalist den or whatever.
[02:22:58.820 --> 02:23:03.540]  And I thought that was a shocking bit of truth from the New York Times, but I think a more
[02:23:03.540 --> 02:23:07.460]  apropos headline would have been a line in the Viper bit.
[02:23:07.460 --> 02:23:09.940]  These people are, they're no match for Trump.
[02:23:09.940 --> 02:23:14.700]  Trump is the one man wrecking crew and I don't think a lot of us could have even foreseen
[02:23:14.700 --> 02:23:17.580]  the effect that he would have had on European politics.
[02:23:17.580 --> 02:23:22.140]  You see this nationalist populist wave that's just washing across the continent from east
[02:23:22.140 --> 02:23:23.140]  to west.
[02:23:23.140 --> 02:23:26.920]  I mean, I did a story the other day at News Wars about Switzerland is even introducing
[02:23:26.920 --> 02:23:31.780]  a referendum to sever some of the ties that they have with the EU, namely the open border
[02:23:31.780 --> 02:23:32.900]  agreements.
[02:23:32.900 --> 02:23:34.540]  So you see this kind of coming in.
[02:23:34.540 --> 02:23:37.740]  I think Victor Orban kind of was pioneering this whole thing.
[02:23:37.740 --> 02:23:43.100]  And with the rise of Trump has come the rise of nationalist populism in Europe and is very
[02:23:43.100 --> 02:23:44.100]  powerful.
[02:23:44.100 --> 02:23:47.980]  And you can tell that these globalists and Davos are terrified, even with the name of
[02:23:47.980 --> 02:23:53.620]  the confab this year is, have it written down here, creating a shared future in a fractured
[02:23:53.620 --> 02:23:54.620]  world.
[02:23:54.620 --> 02:23:59.020]  If that's not a dig at Trump and also revealing their cards, I don't know what it is.
[02:23:59.020 --> 02:24:01.020]  Well, Dan, here's the deal.
[02:24:01.020 --> 02:24:04.740]  And I've talked to Lord Moncton about this and others and I've talked to people at the
[02:24:04.740 --> 02:24:05.740]  State Department.
[02:24:05.740 --> 02:24:08.660]  Because they bounce stuff off Trump's thinking about.
[02:24:08.660 --> 02:24:14.100]  I'm all about the UN or global bodies if they're elected, if people want to be part
[02:24:14.100 --> 02:24:18.300]  of them, if nations want to come together and unilaterally, you know, make deals with
[02:24:18.300 --> 02:24:20.980]  each other or have larger combines, that's fine.
[02:24:20.980 --> 02:24:25.300]  But you can't do it with the UN or NATO or all these groups because they were set up
[02:24:25.300 --> 02:24:29.140]  by the Rockefellers and Rothschilds to be authoritarian.
[02:24:29.140 --> 02:24:33.420]  And so we're all about alliances, we're all about countries, I'm all about world citizens,
[02:24:33.420 --> 02:24:36.660]  I'm all about being able to live wherever you want, I hope nations would, you know,
[02:24:36.660 --> 02:24:37.660]  make it simpler.
[02:24:37.660 --> 02:24:40.540]  I'm all about freedom, just like you live in, you know, Switzerland.
[02:24:40.540 --> 02:24:43.660]  But that's not what they're doing, they're creating a one world government that tracks
[02:24:43.660 --> 02:24:48.340]  what you do, that taxes all carbon, that exempts all these big corporations and is bringing
[02:24:48.340 --> 02:24:49.340]  in a hellish system.
[02:24:49.340 --> 02:24:52.500]  I mean, these groups rape third world countries.
[02:24:52.500 --> 02:24:58.700]  They push race war, they're ruthless with this whole candy liberal coding garbage.
[02:24:58.700 --> 02:25:04.940]  So that's what's happening here and the EU's on its last leg, look at this article here
[02:25:04.940 --> 02:25:05.940]  out of London Telegraph.
[02:25:05.940 --> 02:25:09.180]  I mean, this reads like M4 Wars five years ago.
[02:25:09.180 --> 02:25:14.940]  World must wake up to threat from tech giants, Silicon Valley billionaire Mark Binoff has
[02:25:14.940 --> 02:25:19.020]  compared the current crisis of trust facing the tech giants to the financial crisis of
[02:25:19.020 --> 02:25:23.340]  a decade ago, urging regulators to wake up to the threat from Google, Facebook and other
[02:25:23.340 --> 02:25:24.700]  dominant firms.
[02:25:24.700 --> 02:25:28.220]  The outspoken entrepreneur accused some of the industry's most influential bosses of
[02:25:28.220 --> 02:25:33.100]  advocating responsibility and being ignorant, how powerful and sophisticated they become.
[02:25:33.100 --> 02:25:39.580]  Regulators now have a choice, but to intervene, he said, we are in a new world a decade ago.
[02:25:39.580 --> 02:25:43.580]  You had banks talking about collateralized debt obligations and credit default swaps
[02:25:43.580 --> 02:25:47.020]  saying they were great for the economy, regulators weren't paying attention.
[02:25:47.020 --> 02:25:51.820]  The government needs to come to the point of true north, he said in a panel discussion
[02:25:51.820 --> 02:25:53.820]  the World Economic Forum at Switzerland.
[02:25:53.820 --> 02:25:59.220]  I mean, these groups are super authoritarian, they're bigger than governments and they're
[02:25:59.220 --> 02:26:00.220]  doing whatever they want.
[02:26:00.220 --> 02:26:06.660]  And then the answer is Rupert Murdoch going, oh, Trump, shut them down, bust them up and
[02:26:06.660 --> 02:26:11.860]  then shut down all the independent media and make people pay to get news core and the New
[02:26:11.860 --> 02:26:12.860]  York Times.
[02:26:12.860 --> 02:26:15.620]  And the New York Times goes, yeah, yeah, we like that.
[02:26:15.620 --> 02:26:20.540]  So get rid of the Silicon Valley monopoly and have the old media come in and do it.
[02:26:20.540 --> 02:26:24.420]  I mean, good God, this is insane.
[02:26:24.420 --> 02:26:28.580]  Speaking of the New York Times is interestingly the trains that are running kind of within
[02:26:28.580 --> 02:26:34.140]  an hour radius of Davos, which are being frequented by journalists and people that are visiting
[02:26:34.140 --> 02:26:35.140]  the event.
[02:26:35.140 --> 02:26:40.260]  The New York Times took out an ad on all these trains and it just says truth.
[02:26:40.260 --> 02:26:42.460]  More important now than ever, the New York Times.
[02:26:42.460 --> 02:26:43.460]  You wouldn't normally see that.
[02:26:43.460 --> 02:26:45.140]  I hope you took a photo of that.
[02:26:45.140 --> 02:26:46.820]  That tweet is gold.
[02:26:46.820 --> 02:26:47.820]  I do have that.
[02:26:47.820 --> 02:26:48.820]  I do.
[02:26:48.820 --> 02:26:49.820]  And I'll put that up on Twitter.
[02:26:49.820 --> 02:26:53.140]  That tweet is at real Alex Jones and that present planet right now.
[02:26:53.140 --> 02:26:56.180]  Tell us more of the bombshell, the things you've seen.
[02:26:56.180 --> 02:27:01.140]  Well, I think another thing that's very interesting is that the word you were saying five years
[02:27:01.140 --> 02:27:04.740]  ago, the London Telegraph is writing, you know, our headlines five years later.
[02:27:04.740 --> 02:27:08.980]  The word globalism in general, not too long ago, when you said that to people, they looked
[02:27:08.980 --> 02:27:10.820]  at you like you were a loon.
[02:27:10.820 --> 02:27:15.980]  But I have seen the word global and globalism so many times all over Davos this week.
[02:27:15.980 --> 02:27:21.220]  And in the mainstream press that it's amazing, it's all just out in the open now all the
[02:27:21.220 --> 02:27:22.220]  way through.
[02:27:22.220 --> 02:27:24.420]  I mean, we're talking about secret societies and the FBI now.
[02:27:24.420 --> 02:27:28.900]  So all the things that we've been talking about for years and you for decades now are
[02:27:28.900 --> 02:27:29.900]  mainstream.
[02:27:29.900 --> 02:27:30.900]  It's incredible.
[02:27:30.900 --> 02:27:34.620]  All I was about to say, just early last year, it was like in February, it's almost a year
[02:27:34.620 --> 02:27:39.460]  ago, they had a front page New York Times article going, we can see we can pull it up.
[02:27:39.460 --> 02:27:44.060]  It was something like, is globalism real and here are the people that believe in it?
[02:27:44.060 --> 02:27:49.740]  And then it's an article about me saying I'm insane and that it doesn't exist.
[02:27:49.740 --> 02:27:56.820]  But it's admitted global authoritarian technocracy unelected in their own words.
[02:27:56.820 --> 02:27:57.820]  No question.
[02:27:57.820 --> 02:28:01.860]  And I think one of the things also this week that's very interesting, one of the, there
[02:28:01.860 --> 02:28:03.940]  are seven women co-chairing the event.
[02:28:03.940 --> 02:28:07.900]  One of them is IMF head, Christine Lagarde, who is a big global warmest.
[02:28:07.900 --> 02:28:10.580]  She's constantly pushing that agenda.
[02:28:10.580 --> 02:28:16.260]  And she's on record, you can look up her quotes where she says, fixing global warming is really
[02:28:16.260 --> 02:28:21.220]  about destroying the global economic system that's been based on capitalism forever.

[02:29:58.980 --> 02:30:03.580]  We have found an extraordinary new natural way to help alleviate seasonal distress symptoms

[02:30:09.140 --> 02:30:10.540]  and normal breathing.
[02:30:10.540 --> 02:30:11.540]  This is pollen block.
[02:30:11.540 --> 02:30:16.900]  In the 1960s researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs from
[02:30:16.900 --> 02:30:22.940]  specific farms experienced less seasonal distress symptoms like runny nose, itchy watery eyes
[02:30:22.940 --> 02:30:25.100]  and excessive mucus production.
[02:30:25.100 --> 02:30:29.700]  But against studying the effects in published trials, in their published trials, now we
[02:30:29.700 --> 02:30:35.500]  are introducing the fruit of the research, a fast acting chewable tablet, just two tablets

[02:31:00.260 --> 02:31:03.900]  of going with those talking points, let me just give you what I've experienced personally.
[02:31:03.900 --> 02:31:08.460]  From all the wives, tales and every culture we know that the bones have the essence.

[02:31:11.700 --> 02:31:18.180]  Again in every culture this has been reported because it works and there's no way to quantify
[02:31:18.180 --> 02:31:23.300]  how strong this is but the amount of bone protein and the amount of marrow and the amount
[02:31:23.300 --> 02:31:29.140]  of concentrated life force that is in this is incredible.

[02:33:18.900 --> 02:33:21.420]  Jones show.
[02:33:21.420 --> 02:33:27.820]  Well, there's the New York Times that Dan Lyman was just mentioning from two days ago.
[02:33:27.820 --> 02:33:30.460]  Works in the globalist hen house.
[02:33:30.460 --> 02:33:31.700]  Devo so waits.
[02:33:31.700 --> 02:33:33.260]  Trump's arrival.
[02:33:33.260 --> 02:33:34.260]  Just a year ago.
[02:33:34.260 --> 02:33:35.740]  We can put it on screen.
[02:33:35.740 --> 02:33:38.220]  The crew found it.
[02:33:38.220 --> 02:33:45.260]  They had a headline about Trump era and the fight against globalism and how it's delusional
[02:33:45.260 --> 02:33:46.460]  and does it even exist.
[02:33:46.460 --> 02:33:51.100]  If you guys can throw that back on screen for TV viewers.
[02:33:51.100 --> 02:33:52.100]  There it is.
[02:33:52.100 --> 02:33:53.100]  Globalism.
[02:33:53.100 --> 02:34:01.820]  The policy theory bullied by Trump and then it shows a swastika and says media and it's
[02:34:01.820 --> 02:34:06.820]  a guy wearing a Hillary for prison infowars.com shirt.
[02:34:06.820 --> 02:34:09.380]  Now remember, let me see if my memory serves.
[02:34:09.380 --> 02:34:11.380]  I thought that was in February of last year.
[02:34:11.380 --> 02:34:13.180]  Can we put the date up?
[02:34:13.180 --> 02:34:14.180]  I liked it.
[02:34:14.180 --> 02:34:15.180]  Not last year.
[02:34:15.180 --> 02:34:16.180]  Now a year.
[02:34:16.180 --> 02:34:17.180]  Year and two months ago.
[02:34:17.180 --> 02:34:18.180]  Punch that back up for me.
[02:34:18.180 --> 02:34:19.660]  I want to see what date that New York Times.
[02:34:19.660 --> 02:34:20.660]  Okay.
[02:34:20.660 --> 02:34:21.660]  November 14th.
[02:34:21.660 --> 02:34:23.860]  Wow, so I was wrong.
[02:34:23.860 --> 02:34:26.060]  That didn't come out after the election.
[02:34:26.060 --> 02:34:27.060]  That came out during it.
[02:34:27.060 --> 02:34:28.060]  See, my memory fell sometimes.
[02:34:28.060 --> 02:34:29.060]  That was a few months before.
[02:34:29.060 --> 02:34:30.580]  That was right after the president was elected.
[02:34:30.580 --> 02:34:31.580]  I knew that.
[02:34:31.580 --> 02:34:36.140]  So then it goes on to say I'm insane.
[02:34:36.140 --> 02:34:37.620]  Globalism doesn't exist.
[02:34:37.620 --> 02:34:40.780]  The globalists call their world government system globalism.
[02:34:40.780 --> 02:34:44.220]  They say a technocracy of unelected systems runs it.
[02:34:44.220 --> 02:34:45.380]  It's anti-human.
[02:34:45.380 --> 02:34:46.380]  It's transhumanist.
[02:34:46.380 --> 02:34:47.380]  It's post-human.
[02:34:47.380 --> 02:34:51.620]  I can quote hundreds of top globalists saying it.
[02:34:51.620 --> 02:34:53.940]  And then they go on and say I'm crazy.
[02:34:53.940 --> 02:34:54.940]  It doesn't exist.
[02:34:54.940 --> 02:34:59.140]  Well, it reminded me that was Dan Lyman quoting some of the Davos people saying we're getting
[02:34:59.140 --> 02:35:01.380]  rid of your existing capitalism.
[02:35:01.380 --> 02:35:03.860]  We're replacing it with mega rich.
[02:35:03.860 --> 02:35:04.980]  But you live in socialism.
[02:35:04.980 --> 02:35:07.460]  You're not allowed to join the capitalist system.
[02:35:07.460 --> 02:35:09.540]  I mean, you talk about the new class system.
[02:35:09.540 --> 02:35:10.540]  This is it.
[02:35:10.540 --> 02:35:15.980]  This is like the opposite of what people like Marx even envisioned, which was bad enough.
[02:35:15.980 --> 02:35:18.180]  So you have a classless society?
[02:35:18.180 --> 02:35:23.340]  Well, yeah, you have no class, but it's a total stratified society where globalists
[02:35:23.340 --> 02:35:30.220]  of the new royalty offshore tax exempt above the law diplomatic community on mountaintops
[02:35:30.220 --> 02:35:36.780]  protected by the government taxpayers and into the midst of it, like a baseball bat
[02:35:36.780 --> 02:35:44.500]  into a beehive comes the Fox and Trump does look like a big old Red Fox, doesn't he?
[02:35:44.500 --> 02:35:48.580]  And so a year later, a year and two months later, let's put it back on screen.
[02:35:48.580 --> 02:35:52.020]  They go Fox in the globalist 10 house.
[02:35:52.020 --> 02:35:53.020]  I ticked.
[02:35:53.020 --> 02:35:54.020]  Wait a minute.
[02:35:54.020 --> 02:35:56.340]  The New York Times and he just tweeted it.
[02:35:56.340 --> 02:35:57.340]  We retreated it.
[02:35:57.340 --> 02:35:58.340]  Real Alice Jones.
[02:35:58.340 --> 02:36:03.860]  Dan Lyman just tweeted from the train up the mountain, New York Times adds truth is
[02:36:03.860 --> 02:36:10.340]  more important now than ever.
[02:36:10.340 --> 02:36:16.020]  Fake fake news at New York Times takes out advertising on all local trains around hashtag
[02:36:16.020 --> 02:36:20.820]  Davos hashtag World Economic Forum.
[02:36:20.820 --> 02:36:22.260]  And Twitter will probably just ban it.
[02:36:22.260 --> 02:36:23.260]  You can copy it.
[02:36:23.260 --> 02:36:24.260]  Put it on yours before they do.
[02:36:24.260 --> 02:36:28.180]  You know, it is or say it's a Russian bot, you know, just showing the New York Times
[02:36:28.180 --> 02:36:29.340]  saying their truth.
[02:36:29.340 --> 02:36:30.460]  That's a Russian bot.
[02:36:30.460 --> 02:36:39.620]  How about it says sh dash T whole or baloney whole New York Times Bravo Sierra just make
[02:36:39.620 --> 02:36:41.020]  it classy.
[02:36:41.020 --> 02:36:42.500]  We should have our own New York Times ads.
[02:36:42.500 --> 02:36:46.140]  Well, I could have had fun about the bag full of stickers like that.
[02:36:46.140 --> 02:36:49.900]  New York Times Bravo Sierra kids like what's that mean money?
[02:36:49.900 --> 02:36:52.500]  It means BS.
[02:36:52.500 --> 02:36:58.260]  So Dan, you were getting into that before the break, requote those people under Secretary
[02:36:58.260 --> 02:36:59.260]  of State strobe Talbot.
[02:36:59.260 --> 02:37:03.420]  I mean, there's hundreds of these quotes publicly where they say, we're going to end
[02:37:03.420 --> 02:37:04.420]  the family.
[02:37:04.420 --> 02:37:05.420]  We're going to end free market.
[02:37:05.420 --> 02:37:06.420]  We're going to run your life.
[02:37:06.420 --> 02:37:10.420]  We're going to, and then they're going to live on jumbo jets and mountain tops and
[02:37:10.420 --> 02:37:17.580]  be a tax exempt and have Bernie Sanders go seven houses and a couple hundred thousand
[02:37:17.580 --> 02:37:24.540]  dollar cars and 10 million in the bank, white people don't know what it's like to be poor.
[02:37:24.540 --> 02:37:25.540]  Dan Lyman.
[02:37:25.540 --> 02:37:26.540]  Right.
[02:37:26.540 --> 02:37:30.700]  And the New York Times says they want to talk about the truth and publish the truth.
[02:37:30.700 --> 02:37:32.500]  Well, if they do, the truth is out there.
[02:37:32.500 --> 02:37:33.500]  It's easy to find.
[02:37:33.500 --> 02:37:37.380]  They've been fawning over the, the global warming fixes that everyone's going to come
[02:37:37.380 --> 02:37:38.500]  up with this week.
[02:37:38.500 --> 02:37:43.580]  This is from 2015 investors business daily, a quote from the, at the time, she might
[02:37:43.580 --> 02:37:46.740]  still be was the UN's framework convention on climate change.
[02:37:46.740 --> 02:37:51.060]  She was the executive secretary, Christiana Figueres.
[02:37:51.060 --> 02:37:55.180]  She said, this is the first time in the history of mankind that we are setting ourselves to
[02:37:55.180 --> 02:38:00.140]  the task of intentionally within a defined period of time to change the economic development
[02:38:00.140 --> 02:38:05.820]  model that has been raining for at least the last 50 years since the industrial revolution.
[02:38:05.820 --> 02:38:09.780]  If that doesn't tell you what the whole global warming agenda is about, I mean, the New York
[02:38:09.780 --> 02:38:11.140]  Times could easily cover this.
[02:38:11.140 --> 02:38:12.140]  It's out there.
[02:38:12.140 --> 02:38:18.700]  And by the way, that model wasn't perfect, but if you study the British Empire, the Dutch
[02:38:18.700 --> 02:38:24.820]  Empire, the Soviet Union that was forming at that time, what the Germans and the Austrian
[02:38:24.820 --> 02:38:30.860]  Hungarian Empire's core system did and what was left of what the, what the Spanish and
[02:38:30.860 --> 02:38:34.020]  Portuguese had set up, there was no existing order.
[02:38:34.020 --> 02:38:37.500]  That's why Hitler made a move for it because there was no order.
[02:38:37.500 --> 02:38:43.220]  The British Empire was collapsed, was in retreat financially and decadent and leaderless
[02:38:43.220 --> 02:38:46.660]  and part Nazi looking up the king of England was a Nazi.
[02:38:46.660 --> 02:38:52.020]  He Edward the eight, he had to, had to advocate and all the rest of it.
[02:38:52.020 --> 02:38:55.220]  They were having me that the king of the EU was a Nazi plan.
[02:38:55.220 --> 02:38:56.460]  And again, they go, Oh, yeah, right.
[02:38:56.460 --> 02:38:57.460]  Look it up.
[02:38:57.460 --> 02:38:58.460]  It's mainstream news.
[02:38:58.460 --> 02:38:59.460]  Okay.
[02:38:59.460 --> 02:39:00.460]  Can't make this crap up.
[02:39:00.460 --> 02:39:01.460]  And I'm like cursed with knowledge, cursed with knowing this.
[02:39:01.460 --> 02:39:02.460]  It's fun to learn it.
[02:39:02.460 --> 02:39:05.380]  But then it's like you're talking to the public and I think you're speaking Chinese to them
[02:39:05.380 --> 02:39:06.380]  or something, man.
[02:39:06.380 --> 02:39:10.620]  And yeah, there's the king, anyone with Hitler and his wife show.
[02:39:10.620 --> 02:39:12.020]  You're dealing with all of this.
[02:39:12.020 --> 02:39:14.420]  There's photos in with his kids in the back of the car with Hitler.
[02:39:14.420 --> 02:39:18.220]  I mean, these people, he was German, but let me get back to what I was saying.
[02:39:18.220 --> 02:39:21.780]  Cause I kind of was the forest for the trees.
[02:39:21.780 --> 02:39:25.860]  You had America at the end of that coming in with the Bretton Woods agreement and the
[02:39:25.860 --> 02:39:28.860]  system and doing some positive things.
[02:39:28.860 --> 02:39:29.860]  Yeah.
[02:39:29.860 --> 02:39:31.780]  There's ever the eighth of the Eagles nest.
[02:39:31.780 --> 02:39:32.940]  See right there.
[02:39:32.940 --> 02:39:35.060]  And it just goes on and on.
[02:39:35.060 --> 02:39:37.820]  And then the globalist went, wait, we don't want America to just turn all these countries
[02:39:37.820 --> 02:39:41.740]  loose and have freedom worldwide and real economic globalism where we all just free
[02:39:41.740 --> 02:39:42.980]  for all, do whatever we want.
[02:39:42.980 --> 02:39:47.660]  A bunch of companies got together like they always do and said, no, the plan of Hitler
[02:39:47.660 --> 02:39:51.620]  and this literally happened, merged with the British empire will be a new economic system
[02:39:51.620 --> 02:39:53.620]  where we buy these countries off and take control.
[02:39:53.620 --> 02:39:55.260]  We'll use Western money to do it.
[02:39:55.260 --> 02:39:59.780]  And then we'll deindustrialize the West to leverage control and bring shipping and manufacturing
[02:39:59.780 --> 02:40:02.700]  to China, India, Mexico and other areas.
[02:40:02.700 --> 02:40:06.140]  Then we'll leverage the West out and use that as an economic control arm to come in with
[02:40:06.140 --> 02:40:07.900]  absolute full control of the West.
[02:40:07.900 --> 02:40:08.900]  And that's globalism.
[02:40:08.900 --> 02:40:12.820]  And they wrote books admitting it and Donald Trump said, you know what, this doesn't work.
[02:40:12.820 --> 02:40:14.100]  It screws people over.
[02:40:14.100 --> 02:40:15.420]  It's we're going to blow it up.
[02:40:15.420 --> 02:40:16.420]  Okay.
[02:40:16.420 --> 02:40:21.340]  And it's so easy to blow up because it's so tenuous and so authoritarian.
[02:40:21.340 --> 02:40:25.380]  And so unelected and so shadowy that, okay, I'm going to get us out of TPP that Obama
[02:40:25.380 --> 02:40:26.380]  signed secret.
[02:40:26.380 --> 02:40:27.380]  Boom.
[02:40:27.380 --> 02:40:28.380]  Whole thing's blown up right there.
[02:40:28.380 --> 02:40:33.220]  The thing is, it's so secret that it counted on us never knowing it was there.
[02:40:33.220 --> 02:40:38.580]  That's how a year ago and two months, 14 months ago, the New York Times could say there's no
[02:40:38.580 --> 02:40:39.580]  globalism.
[02:40:39.580 --> 02:40:40.700]  There's no technocracy.
[02:40:40.700 --> 02:40:41.780]  It doesn't exist.
[02:40:41.780 --> 02:40:46.380]  And 14 months later, red alert, the fox is in our main command base.
[02:40:46.380 --> 02:40:47.380]  He's in the Death Star.
[02:40:47.380 --> 02:40:49.420]  God, he's about to blow it.
[02:40:49.420 --> 02:40:51.820]  I mean, Dan, this is incredible.
[02:40:51.820 --> 02:40:56.980]  Their whole, can we roll the video in the background of the Wizard of Oz curtain scene
[02:40:56.980 --> 02:40:58.700]  when Toto pulls the curtain back?
[02:40:58.700 --> 02:41:03.660]  Because their greatest power was they didn't exist like the devil, but they did.
[02:41:03.660 --> 02:41:11.060]  And once we get people to admit they exist, game over, baby, sorry, go ahead.
[02:41:11.060 --> 02:41:14.620]  They're wounded animals now at this point.
[02:41:14.620 --> 02:41:15.620]  There goes info wars.
[02:41:15.620 --> 02:41:16.620]  There goes the audience.
[02:41:16.620 --> 02:41:17.620]  There goes Matt Rudge.
[02:41:17.620 --> 02:41:18.620]  Look at Toto right there.
[02:41:18.620 --> 02:41:19.620]  I'm not the biggest thing around.
[02:41:19.620 --> 02:41:20.620]  I'm not trying to be cool.
[02:41:20.620 --> 02:41:22.620]  Just dog it.
[02:41:22.620 --> 02:41:24.980]  And look what the dog does.
[02:41:24.980 --> 02:41:26.540]  I think if it were symbol should be a dog.
[02:41:26.540 --> 02:41:28.220]  I've been thinking about what our symbol ought to be.
[02:41:28.220 --> 02:41:29.460]  I think it's a sheepdog.
[02:41:29.460 --> 02:41:30.460]  It's a dog.
[02:41:30.460 --> 02:41:32.460]  What do you think?
[02:41:32.460 --> 02:41:33.460]  Sounds good to me.
[02:41:33.460 --> 02:41:34.460]  I like the sound of that.
[02:41:34.460 --> 02:41:35.460]  I know I'm ranting.
[02:41:35.460 --> 02:41:36.460]  I apologize.
[02:41:36.460 --> 02:41:37.460]  I mean, what do you, you heard my whole rant though.
[02:41:37.460 --> 02:41:38.460]  It's true.
[02:41:38.460 --> 02:41:41.780]  They had to operate by stealth, but they wanted total control at the end.
[02:41:41.780 --> 02:41:43.340]  So they uncloak their world government.
[02:41:43.340 --> 02:41:46.340]  We said, whoa, everybody warned us about this.
[02:41:46.340 --> 02:41:47.340]  Bye bye.
[02:41:47.340 --> 02:41:48.340]  No.
[02:41:48.340 --> 02:41:50.580]  This is whatever work.
[02:41:50.580 --> 02:41:54.700]  And I think the, the awakening, it is definitely happening, you know, at the voter level, but
[02:41:54.700 --> 02:41:58.140]  you know, even when you see kind of glimpses of it in what people are talking about, you
[02:41:58.140 --> 02:42:01.300]  know, the, the article you just presented from the telegraph about, you know, we have
[02:42:01.300 --> 02:42:03.180]  to be cautious about these tech giants.
[02:42:03.180 --> 02:42:08.180]  I think there's an element of self preservation that is awakening certain people in the upper
[02:42:08.180 --> 02:42:12.540]  echelons and the elites where they say, you know what, my family is not going to have
[02:42:12.540 --> 02:42:17.100]  a future at some point down the line or my offspring or even myself if things get too,
[02:42:17.100 --> 02:42:18.140]  you know, weird enough.
[02:42:18.140 --> 02:42:22.660]  So I think there's an element of self preservation that is waking certain people up within the
[02:42:22.660 --> 02:42:24.900]  globalist elite empire.
[02:42:24.900 --> 02:42:27.780]  And that's going to work against them as well, because then you're going to have people on
[02:42:27.780 --> 02:42:29.380]  the inside that are blowing them up.
[02:42:29.380 --> 02:42:33.300]  People like Ted Malick, who I've been working, has been working to do that for years.
[02:42:33.300 --> 02:42:34.300]  That's right.
[02:42:34.300 --> 02:42:37.500]  Dan Lyman, we're going to follow you tomorrow and ride through Trump's incredible historic
[02:42:37.500 --> 02:42:40.540]  visit and the amazing tweets you're putting out.
[02:42:40.540 --> 02:42:41.700]  You are awesome.
[02:42:41.700 --> 02:42:42.700]  Yeah.
[02:42:42.700 --> 02:42:46.460]  Translating the New York timeshine from truth to obey.
[02:42:46.460 --> 02:42:47.460]  That's what they're saying.
[02:42:47.460 --> 02:42:48.460]  We are the truth.
[02:42:48.460 --> 02:42:49.460]  We are the facts.
[02:42:49.460 --> 02:42:53.740]  No, you're owned by the corrupt kingpin out of Mexico, Carlos Slim, and the Washington
[02:42:53.740 --> 02:42:54.740]  Post.
[02:42:54.740 --> 02:43:00.580]  I want to plow into all of this, but I'm going to spend a few minutes here first, just encouraging
[02:43:00.580 --> 02:43:06.980]  listeners to understand that when you buy t-shirts or water filtration systems or books
[02:43:06.980 --> 02:43:14.220]  or videos or other material from infostore.com, you are funding the revolution.
[02:43:14.220 --> 02:43:19.140]  I mean, I cannot say it any clear, and so it is essential that you purchase the products
[02:43:19.140 --> 02:43:20.140]  at infostore.com.
[02:43:20.140 --> 02:43:23.780]  I don't want to thank everybody that has, but we've got the best fluoride-free toothpaste
[02:43:23.780 --> 02:43:27.660]  with colloidal silver and with high-quality atomic iodine in it.
[02:43:27.660 --> 02:43:30.060]  You cannot beat that for children and adults.
[02:43:30.060 --> 02:43:34.180]  We've got the best mouthwash designed by Dr. Jones, that's my dad, with colloidal silver
[02:43:34.180 --> 02:43:42.020]  and iodine as well, infowarslife.com, or AAA-253-3139, and your purchase of the products stands
[02:43:42.020 --> 02:43:45.540]  with us, stands with America, stands with Trump, stands against the globalists and their
[02:43:45.540 --> 02:43:47.180]  satanic pedophile armies.
[02:43:47.180 --> 02:43:50.300]  And that's who they are, and they know we know who they are, and they're coming back
[02:43:50.300 --> 02:43:54.220]  against us so we need your support.
[02:43:54.220 --> 02:43:56.300]  Frank in North Carolina, thanks for holding so long.
[02:43:56.300 --> 02:43:57.300]  Go ahead.
[02:43:57.300 --> 02:43:59.300]  Yeah, I just have to say something, man.
[02:43:59.300 --> 02:44:02.980]  It seems like every time I turn on your broadcast, you're bragging.
[02:44:02.980 --> 02:44:03.980]  It just gets old, man.
[02:44:03.980 --> 02:44:06.940]  I'm going to shut you down right now, okay?
[02:44:06.940 --> 02:44:09.180]  We're taking calls about your nomination.
[02:44:09.180 --> 02:44:13.300]  Do you understand they're having congressional hearings trying to shut us down?
[02:44:13.300 --> 02:44:15.860]  Do you understand I'm ringing the alarm?
[02:44:15.860 --> 02:44:19.060]  If that was happening to anybody else, I'd be freaked out.
[02:44:19.060 --> 02:44:21.620]  I mean, what's it going to take, us being shut down?
[02:44:21.620 --> 02:44:22.620]  Is that what you want, Frank?
[02:44:22.620 --> 02:44:23.620]  You know what, Alex?
[02:44:23.620 --> 02:44:25.620]  Hey, put him on pause again.
[02:44:25.620 --> 02:44:30.180]  Hey, Frank, do you understand it's not bragging to say we are the tip of the spear, we're
[02:44:30.180 --> 02:44:32.060]  under attack, we need your help?
[02:44:32.060 --> 02:44:36.420]  As much begging as I do, we can barely pay the bills and grow in the face of this.
[02:44:36.420 --> 02:44:39.420]  I'm not going to just stop growth and let them start pushing us backwards.
[02:44:39.420 --> 02:44:40.420]  Do you understand?
[02:44:40.420 --> 02:44:41.620]  I need your help, Frank.
[02:44:41.620 --> 02:44:43.900]  I need your help, Frank.
[02:44:43.900 --> 02:44:49.180]  Go to infowarstore.com right now and help fund the Info Wars.
[02:44:49.180 --> 02:44:50.180]  Do you understand?
[02:44:50.180 --> 02:44:51.900]  I need your help, Frank.
[02:44:51.900 --> 02:44:55.300]  Free press needs your help, Frank.
[02:44:55.300 --> 02:45:01.460]  I am very proud to announce the introduction of the highest quality Info Wars biome defense
[02:45:01.460 --> 02:45:02.900]  probiotic.
[02:45:02.900 --> 02:45:09.620]  We wanted to come out with the largest spectrum of high quality known probiotics that have
[02:45:09.620 --> 02:45:17.300]  been proven to improve overall digestion and health and detoxification in the body.
[02:45:17.300 --> 02:45:22.260]  Biome defense is an exclusive blend of 50 billion live and active cultures from over
[02:45:22.260 --> 02:45:28.940]  23 different probiotic strains that are known to support digestion and intestinal function.
[02:45:28.940 --> 02:45:33.540]  Our researchers are confident that we have been able to develop what will be the leading
[02:45:33.540 --> 02:45:36.060]  probiotic on the market.
[02:45:36.060 --> 02:45:41.140]  Secure your biome defense in ultra strength or regular strength at infowarslife.com today

[02:45:44.740 --> 02:45:48.980]  We've been testing this formula for years, but this is the limited first run to the public,

[02:45:59.220 --> 02:46:04.580]  a lot of money while you get high quality products and fund the Info War, a 360 win.
[02:46:04.580 --> 02:46:09.540]  Number one, when you choose auto ship before checkout, we give you 10% off on your order
[02:46:09.540 --> 02:46:11.140]  at infowarsore.com.
[02:46:11.140 --> 02:46:14.980]  Number two, you're also able to get items that are out of stock when you sign up for
[02:46:14.980 --> 02:46:19.100]  auto ship because we hold back a surplus for auto ship customers.
[02:46:19.100 --> 02:46:24.300]  Number three, we're giving you free shipping on all orders above $50.
[02:46:24.300 --> 02:46:28.380]  Customers have been requesting this for years because it's so easy to forget to reorder
[02:46:28.380 --> 02:46:30.180]  the products that you need each month.
[02:46:30.180 --> 02:46:34.780]  Just go to infowarsore.com, select your favorite product or products, click on auto ship and

[02:46:37.900 --> 02:46:43.220]  As you know, I coined the term 360 win and with the new auto ship feature at infowarslife.com,
[02:46:43.220 --> 02:46:44.580]  this is a sure win.
[02:46:44.580 --> 02:46:46.180]  10% off on auto ship.
[02:46:46.180 --> 02:46:52.020]  Win win win at infowarslife.com, free shipping on orders above $50 and all out of stock items
[02:46:52.020 --> 02:46:58.100]  are never out of stock when you sign up for auto ship.
[02:46:58.100 --> 02:47:11.100]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[02:47:11.100 --> 02:47:12.100]  Welcome back.
[02:47:12.100 --> 02:47:13.100]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[02:47:13.100 --> 02:47:15.660]  I'm going to co-host some of the next hour with Roger Stone, and the war room is coming
[02:47:15.660 --> 02:47:20.500]  up with Owen Schroyer and Roger Stone and others.
[02:47:20.500 --> 02:47:23.660]  I don't normally put out fake news on purpose, obviously, we get things wrong sometimes.
[02:47:23.660 --> 02:47:30.100]  If I got cut off by the break, I was saying, Carlos Slim, the Middle Eastern slash Mexican
[02:47:30.100 --> 02:47:35.460]  kingpin who made billions off U.S. taxpayers running the Obama phone scam, he owns the
[02:47:35.460 --> 02:47:36.460]  New York Times.
[02:47:36.460 --> 02:47:40.500]  So when they put up full page ads or put out these big billboards on the train saying,
[02:47:40.500 --> 02:47:46.780]  the New York Times, truth, it's really amazing humor.
[02:47:46.780 --> 02:47:48.500]  Truth is more important now than ever.
[02:47:48.500 --> 02:47:52.740]  Yes, New York Times, it really is.
[02:47:52.740 --> 02:47:55.380]  And then the jokes, obviously, are flowing with that.
[02:47:55.380 --> 02:47:59.540]  The New York Times, BS is more important now than ever.
[02:47:59.540 --> 02:48:03.340]  Or lying about WMDs in Iraq is more important than ever.
[02:48:03.340 --> 02:48:07.420]  Or saying, Hillary had a 99% chance of winning in the lead up, and the day of the election,
[02:48:07.420 --> 02:48:08.420]  it was just 98.
[02:48:08.420 --> 02:48:12.020]  And about an hour before she lost, it was like 70%.
[02:48:12.020 --> 02:48:14.580]  I mean, it just made up crap.
[02:48:14.580 --> 02:48:17.220]  We are the New York Times, an appeal to authority.
[02:48:17.220 --> 02:48:23.860]  We are, right now, 99% chance Trump will not be elected.
[02:48:23.860 --> 02:48:25.780]  And the New York Times, total proof he's a Russian agent.
[02:48:25.780 --> 02:48:28.660]  I mean, you've destroyed yourself.
[02:48:28.660 --> 02:48:29.660]  You're a joke.
[02:48:29.660 --> 02:48:32.980]  And then I got cut off, the fake news part was I was saying, and the Washington Post.
[02:48:32.980 --> 02:48:35.740]  It's not like I was saying, Carlos Slim owns the Washington Post.
[02:48:35.740 --> 02:48:40.220]  I was going to say, Bezos, the richest man in the world, who gets all his money off government
[02:48:40.220 --> 02:48:45.780]  subsidies, basically, is in existential war with Trump in America, and it's just such
[02:48:45.780 --> 02:48:50.220]  a jerk, and I've just had enough, man.
[02:48:50.220 --> 02:48:52.700]  And he got, he won't even pay for it though, that's why he's so smart.
[02:48:52.700 --> 02:48:57.660]  He got 600 million with the Washington Post from the CIA to run the disinfo, and what
[02:48:57.660 --> 02:48:58.660]  do they call for?
[02:48:58.660 --> 02:48:59.660]  Banning me.
[02:48:59.660 --> 02:49:00.660]  I'm a Russian.
[02:49:00.660 --> 02:49:07.140]  I mean, this guy's got $110 billion, and he wants me shut off the air.
[02:49:07.140 --> 02:49:09.020]  And it's like, why?
[02:49:09.020 --> 02:49:11.820]  Because your eyes point different directions, your mind points straight.
[02:49:11.820 --> 02:49:15.020]  I'm not mad at you, your eyes point different directions, like a hammerhead or something.
[02:49:15.020 --> 02:49:18.220]  Like a gecko, his eyes are like a tamillion.
[02:49:18.220 --> 02:49:20.100]  I mean, is he even human?
[02:49:20.100 --> 02:49:24.140]  I don't know, but get off my back, dirt bag.
[02:49:24.140 --> 02:49:26.380]  Ideas are bulletproof, jerk.
[02:49:26.380 --> 02:49:29.860]  You thought you'd launch all this, thought you'd all get away with it, got your money,
[02:49:29.860 --> 02:49:33.980]  but your big system to screw us is over, and you're going to get your monopolies taken
[02:49:33.980 --> 02:49:36.740]  away, and if you keep pushing, you're going to get your ass handed to you.
[02:49:36.740 --> 02:49:40.380]  So just keep running your bug-eyed mouth, buddy.
[02:49:40.380 --> 02:49:44.020]  Anyways, Dan Lyman tells us what else you're going to investigate while you're there at
[02:49:44.020 --> 02:49:47.460]  Davos in Switzerland.
[02:49:47.460 --> 02:49:48.620]  Trip by the Santifa House.
[02:49:48.620 --> 02:49:50.620]  I did find it towards the end of today.
[02:49:50.620 --> 02:49:52.340]  I'm just going to keep an eye on that.
[02:49:52.340 --> 02:49:55.900]  What I did find interesting was they have the Molotov cocktail theme with the Trump
[02:49:55.900 --> 02:49:58.260]  name on it and global war.
[02:49:58.260 --> 02:50:01.380]  They've crossed out warming, you know, the end of warming.
[02:50:01.380 --> 02:50:05.900]  So I don't know if that's a signal to all of us that we should be keeping an eye out
[02:50:05.900 --> 02:50:07.900]  for what they have planned possibly for the end of the week.
[02:50:07.900 --> 02:50:11.100]  Well, they call for violence against Trump, so you got them saying, Trump, Molotov cocktail
[02:50:11.100 --> 02:50:14.300]  sounds like, you know, they're saying, burn the place down.
[02:50:14.300 --> 02:50:15.300]  Right.
[02:50:15.300 --> 02:50:18.260]  I mean, that would turn the Davos into victims.
[02:50:18.260 --> 02:50:22.340]  They'd probably say a Trump did it or something.
[02:50:22.340 --> 02:50:26.300]  Yeah, they'd find a way to blame him.
[02:50:26.300 --> 02:50:30.660]  I live about an hour outside of Zurich, and there were already posters going up last week
[02:50:30.660 --> 02:50:36.460]  around town basically in protest of Trump, and the local media was putting a lot of energy
[02:50:36.460 --> 02:50:40.940]  into covering the fact that people were protesting in Zurich and supposedly around the country
[02:50:40.940 --> 02:50:41.940]  that Trump was coming in.
[02:50:41.940 --> 02:50:45.140]  So is Switzerland the same where the mainstream media's corporate whores, but you were telling
[02:50:45.140 --> 02:50:47.900]  me that people in general like Trump, though?
[02:50:47.900 --> 02:50:54.060]  I would say that in general, I haven't encountered as much anti-Trumpism as I have around other
[02:50:54.060 --> 02:50:55.060]  parts of Europe.
[02:50:55.060 --> 02:50:56.260]  I lived in Iceland last year.
[02:50:56.260 --> 02:51:01.620]  I encountered that all the time, even just for being American, I put away the MAGA hat
[02:51:01.620 --> 02:51:03.020]  after the election.
[02:51:03.020 --> 02:51:10.300]  But here, it's not quite as bad, I would say, but definitely the local media is pretty lame.
[02:51:10.300 --> 02:51:16.340]  Like I was saying, Switzerland, the local, they cover national news from each country.
[02:51:16.340 --> 02:51:17.820]  It's very lame news.
[02:51:17.820 --> 02:51:22.620]  But what I found very encouraging about living here is that the party in power is the Swiss
[02:51:22.620 --> 02:51:23.620]  People's Party.
[02:51:23.620 --> 02:51:28.420]  They're the one that have put forth this referendum, which some people are calling Swagsit, to
[02:51:28.420 --> 02:51:31.380]  basically sever ties with the EU and close their borders.
[02:51:31.380 --> 02:51:35.780]  So I think that there is definitely a lot more hope for Switzerland than there is for
[02:51:35.780 --> 02:51:39.300]  a lot of the rest of Europe, at least timing-wise right now.
[02:51:39.300 --> 02:51:42.460]  All right, well, we're on at night time for you every day, so we'll have you on every
[02:51:42.460 --> 02:51:45.380]  day as this unfolds tomorrow, Friday, right through Saturday.
[02:51:45.380 --> 02:51:46.380]  We'll do some special transmissions.
[02:51:46.380 --> 02:51:48.380]  Dan Lyman, thank you so much for infoworks.com.
[02:51:48.380 --> 02:51:49.380]  Cheers.
[02:51:49.380 --> 02:51:50.380]  Thank you.
[02:51:50.380 --> 02:51:51.380]  Thank you.
[02:51:51.380 --> 02:51:52.380]  All right.
[02:51:52.380 --> 02:51:53.380]  Rodgers got huge news coming up.
[02:51:53.380 --> 02:51:56.300]  I just want to remind listeners of something.
[02:51:56.300 --> 02:51:57.380]  I get so excited.
[02:51:57.380 --> 02:52:01.700]  Most talk show hosts plug every segment, and they got, oh, and I could have had all those
[02:52:01.700 --> 02:52:02.700]  sponsors too.
[02:52:02.700 --> 02:52:04.340]  I just don't like doing it.
[02:52:04.340 --> 02:52:09.260]  So we just sell books, videos, water filtration, air filtration, the highest quality supplements,
[02:52:09.260 --> 02:52:13.140]  but you need to go to infoworksstore.com for your own family, but plus for the info wars
[02:52:13.140 --> 02:52:17.700]  so we can send Dan Lyman up that mountain, because believe me, even the place we're putting
[02:52:17.700 --> 02:52:18.700]  him in is expensive.
[02:52:18.700 --> 02:52:19.700]  It is very expensive.
[02:52:19.700 --> 02:52:25.860]  So infoworksstore.com, infowarslife.com, bodies, the ultimate turmeric formula just came in
[02:52:25.860 --> 02:52:26.860]  this week.
[02:52:26.860 --> 02:52:28.420]  I think this is going to be one of our best sellers.
[02:52:28.420 --> 02:52:29.420]  We don't know about turmeric.
[02:52:29.420 --> 02:52:30.740]  Look it up yourself.
[02:52:30.740 --> 02:52:33.180]  The pollen block is now in as well.
[02:52:33.180 --> 02:52:34.420]  It's amazing.
[02:52:34.420 --> 02:52:36.580]  We've got the real red pill.
[02:52:36.580 --> 02:52:38.540]  We've got so much more.
[02:52:38.540 --> 02:52:43.900]  So infoworksstore.com, infowarslife.com, or triple A, two, five, three, three, one, three,
[02:52:43.900 --> 02:52:44.900]  nine.
[02:52:44.900 --> 02:52:47.420]  So it's a 60 day supply, a big bottle.
[02:52:47.420 --> 02:52:48.900]  It's the new bodies.
[02:52:48.900 --> 02:52:49.900]  Find out about it.
[02:52:49.900 --> 02:52:51.220]  In fact, here's a promo piece I shot.
[02:52:51.220 --> 02:52:55.620]  We're going to premiere right now, and I'll come back with Roger Stone and give you the
[02:52:55.620 --> 02:53:02.300]  standard pitch for our new product bodies, which is the ultimate turmeric formula out
[02:53:02.300 --> 02:53:07.420]  there on the market from our deep research, the purity, the concentration, the quality,
[02:53:07.420 --> 02:53:13.220]  and the other synergistic organic compounds that are added to it so that it's bioavailable
[02:53:13.220 --> 02:53:16.260]  and gets into your bloodstream.
[02:53:16.260 --> 02:53:20.980]  I've got a big list of the facts here, and I guess I'll go over some of it for you.
[02:53:20.980 --> 02:53:22.380]  But here's the bottom line.
[02:53:22.380 --> 02:53:27.260]  Talking to Paul Watson about two years ago, I said, which of the products do you use and
[02:53:27.260 --> 02:53:28.620]  like the most?
[02:53:28.620 --> 02:53:31.460]  And he said, listen, what I really want is a turmeric product.
[02:53:31.460 --> 02:53:33.500]  He goes, you've seen the studies.
[02:53:33.500 --> 02:53:34.500]  You know what it does.
[02:53:34.500 --> 02:53:36.220]  You know what it's been proven to do.
[02:53:36.220 --> 02:53:41.940]  It's crazy, and I've read a lot of them out there are adulterated or watered down.
[02:53:41.940 --> 02:53:43.340]  I said, well, let me look into it.
[02:53:43.340 --> 02:53:49.820]  And so it then took us off and on several years to finally come out with this because
[02:53:49.820 --> 02:53:55.220]  I want to bring you the very best product we can get.
[02:53:55.220 --> 02:54:01.660]  I want it to be what myself and my family take, and we've done it.
[02:54:01.660 --> 02:54:08.460]  Turmeric has been used for thousands of years for its known therapeutic effects and is the
[02:54:08.460 --> 02:54:16.420]  subject of well over 10,000 published scientific articles and studies.
[02:54:16.420 --> 02:54:23.660]  Plain turmeric root contains on average about 3% of the active ingredient, the curcuminoids.
[02:54:23.660 --> 02:54:31.380]  But our powerful blend contains turmeric extract containing 95% curcuminoids.
[02:54:31.380 --> 02:54:34.180]  Did you hear what I'm saying?
[02:54:34.180 --> 02:54:38.140]  Most of the brands out there are at 3% or less and are adulterated.
[02:54:38.140 --> 02:54:41.540]  This is 95%.
[02:54:41.540 --> 02:54:47.060]  Body ease ultimate turmeric formula is also fortified with peppering.
[02:54:47.060 --> 02:54:51.940]  Peppering, many studies have shown, helps accelerate the absorption of the turmeric compounds,
[02:54:51.940 --> 02:54:53.700]  the curcuminoids in the body.
[02:54:53.700 --> 02:54:56.300]  Now let's get to Boswellia.
[02:54:56.300 --> 02:55:02.340]  Boswellia is a iubetic herb that has been studied for its anti-inflammatory properties.
[02:55:02.340 --> 02:55:07.220]  In fact, the active ingredient, boswellic acid, has been shown in studies to inhibit
[02:55:07.220 --> 02:55:10.620]  one of the enzymes that actually cause the inflammation response.
[02:55:10.620 --> 02:55:16.460]  Body ease also contains the organic herbs, spiramins, sage, lemon balm, and thyme.
[02:55:16.460 --> 02:55:23.500]  As an added bonus, all of the ingredients we just listed contain very potent antioxidants.
[02:55:23.500 --> 02:55:28.060]  In fact, turmeric's curcuminoids are some of the most potent and naturally occurring
[02:55:28.060 --> 02:55:32.380]  free radical, scavenging antioxidants available on the market.
[02:55:32.380 --> 02:55:36.900]  If you're a radio listener, you've got to go to m4store.com and go to the body ease page
[02:55:36.900 --> 02:55:40.460]  so you can actually see the video the TV viewers can see right now.
[02:55:40.460 --> 02:55:44.380]  If you look at our turmeric product, it's bright yellow-orange the way it's supposed
[02:55:44.380 --> 02:55:45.380]  to be.
[02:55:45.380 --> 02:55:49.260]  That's because the active compound in curcuminoids is orange.
[02:55:49.260 --> 02:55:53.540]  So again, it's not just the concentration, it's not just the studies we've done, it's
[02:55:53.540 --> 02:55:54.940]  not just the test.
[02:55:54.940 --> 02:55:58.820]  It's how vibrant and bright our product is.
[02:55:58.820 --> 02:56:05.620]  The recommended MSRP is $59.95 and is a great deal because of the quality and concentration.
[02:56:05.620 --> 02:56:15.420]  But out of the gates, we're offering bodies for 50% off $29.95 at m4store.com so you and
[02:56:15.420 --> 02:56:18.860]  your children and your wife, your husband, can experience it for yourself.

[02:56:23.740 --> 02:56:28.140]  the globalist and trying to restore not just our republic, but freedom worldwide.
[02:56:28.140 --> 02:56:32.100]  Ladies and gentlemen, I am so excited about bodies.
[02:56:32.100 --> 02:56:34.220]  I hope you will try it for yourself.

[02:56:49.540 --> 02:56:54.540]  It's at m4store.com right now.
[02:56:54.540 --> 02:56:56.860]  And by the way, that's our newest product.
[02:56:56.860 --> 02:57:01.820]  I told you that the X2 at 40% off and the secret 12 will be gone today and nobody's
[02:57:01.820 --> 02:57:05.820]  bad, but that special is still up, which isn't good because it's going to be sold out for
[02:57:05.820 --> 02:57:09.020]  probably a month and I want to sell some of the full price to help fund the operation.
[02:57:09.020 --> 02:57:10.020]  How do we do?
[02:57:10.020 --> 02:57:13.300]  We sell it really low price till it's about to sell out and then we'll go back to regular
[02:57:13.300 --> 02:57:14.300]  price, which is fine.
[02:57:14.300 --> 02:57:17.580]  A lot of folks want to buy that, that supports us until more comes in.
[02:57:17.580 --> 02:57:18.740]  Now we're going to probably sell out of it.
[02:57:18.740 --> 02:57:23.140]  I won't have it for months, but that 40% off is still up at m4store.com as I was watching
[02:57:23.140 --> 02:57:24.860]  and they had the website up and I saw it right there.
[02:57:24.860 --> 02:57:30.940]  So when I get off here, I'm going to the shipping department a couple miles away and I'm going
[02:57:30.940 --> 02:57:33.140]  to get all that changed and all that dialed in.
[02:57:33.140 --> 02:57:34.700]  So you want that special as well.
[02:57:34.700 --> 02:57:35.700]  It's ending today.
[02:57:35.700 --> 02:57:41.260]  If I can get it done, m4store.com, we'll be back with hour number four.
[02:57:41.260 --> 02:57:44.660]  Please stay with us and please spread the links.
[02:57:44.660 --> 02:57:48.020]  M4Ware's Wipe is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine.
[02:57:48.020 --> 02:57:52.820]  We have found extraordinary new natural way to help alleviate seasonal distress symptoms,
[02:57:52.820 --> 02:57:58.180]  including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort and respiratory health
[02:57:58.180 --> 02:57:59.580]  and normal breathing.
[02:57:59.580 --> 02:58:00.580]  This is pollen blood.
[02:58:00.580 --> 02:58:05.900]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs from
[02:58:05.900 --> 02:58:11.940]  specific farms experienced less seasonal distress symptoms like runny nose, itchy watery eyes
[02:58:11.940 --> 02:58:13.580]  and excessive mucus production.
[02:58:13.580 --> 02:58:18.420]  They began studying the effects in public trials, in their public trials.
[02:58:18.420 --> 02:58:24.540]  Now we are introducing the fruit of the research, a fast-acting chewable tablet, just two tablets
[02:58:24.540 --> 02:58:29.340]  at the first sign of seasonal distress and fast-acting pollen block starts working in
[02:58:29.340 --> 02:58:32.860]  about 15 minutes to help alleviate seasonal distress.

[02:58:47.420 --> 02:58:51.460]  Over a year in the making, produced by one of the top organic firms in the country, that
[02:58:51.460 --> 02:58:56.340]  if you want proven studies and documentation, I'm going to speak for hours just on the files
[02:58:56.340 --> 02:59:00.620]  I have here of what this is proven to do, the ingredients in this.
[02:59:00.620 --> 02:59:05.780]  This is the ultimate immune system boost for this time of year, any time of the year.
[02:59:05.780 --> 02:59:11.980]  But immune wall is incredible and folks, other formulas that aren't even as good are $70-80.
[02:59:11.980 --> 02:59:13.540]  It's a great deal at $39.
[02:59:13.540 --> 02:59:19.660]  Immune wall, beta-glucans, olive leaf, and so much more, it is concentrated, you need
[02:59:19.660 --> 02:59:21.260]  to go read what is in here.
[02:59:21.260 --> 02:59:26.260]  The mushroom blend of the most expensive, highest quality mushrooms that just incredibly
[02:59:26.260 --> 02:59:30.260]  accelerate a citrus peel blend, I mean, this is the next level.
[02:59:30.260 --> 02:59:34.940]  It's now available, ladies and gentlemen, immune wall, I think is beyond seasonal, beta-glucan,
[02:59:34.940 --> 02:59:36.820]  olive leaf, and more.
[02:59:36.820 --> 02:59:49.060]  Immune wall m4ware's store.com, m4ware's life.com, or triple A 253-3139.
[02:59:49.060 --> 03:00:13.580]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[03:00:13.580 --> 03:00:18.500]  You know, people ask me why I do what I do, I don't want power over people and I don't
[03:00:18.500 --> 03:00:24.340]  want to have power, but I also don't want to be a slave, and so it's personal.
[03:00:24.340 --> 03:00:28.740]  The globalists want to screw me over, screw the West over, make me their slave, mount
[03:00:28.740 --> 03:00:31.140]  my head on the wall politically, I'm not going to put up with it.
[03:00:31.140 --> 03:00:35.900]  And the globalists had the New York Times 14 months ago say, globalism doesn't exist,
[03:00:35.900 --> 03:00:40.820]  it's made up, Donald Trump supporters are insane, Alex Jones is a liar, until two days
[03:00:40.820 --> 03:00:45.540]  ago they said, okay, globalism is real, Trump is the fox in the globalist hen house, our
[03:00:45.540 --> 03:00:49.700]  technocracy is imploding, that is success.
[03:00:49.700 --> 03:00:54.420]  And thanks to Drudge Report and others, we're here, because I can track it, it was, I mean,
[03:00:54.420 --> 03:00:58.860]  just 10 years ago, no one would talk about it, but Drudge would link to some of our articles
[03:00:58.860 --> 03:01:03.340]  about Bilderberg and the media would flip out and then George Norrie would have me on.
[03:01:03.340 --> 03:01:06.700]  And I'd do hundreds of local radio interviews to get the word out.
[03:01:06.700 --> 03:01:12.460]  So I'm just giving credit where it's due in the history of this, we have come so far.
[03:01:12.460 --> 03:01:17.700]  And then now, meanwhile, we've got top links on drudgereport.com, the reports that Watson's
[03:01:17.700 --> 03:01:22.820]  got from Congressional sources and others and other journalists that have proven they've
[03:01:22.820 --> 03:01:27.580]  got their ear to the ground, that there was a some kind of conspiracy talking about physically
[03:01:27.580 --> 03:01:29.260]  taking the Trump out.
[03:01:29.260 --> 03:01:33.420]  Now the FBI agents admit that they deleted the messages, there's texts where they talk
[03:01:33.420 --> 03:01:34.860]  about deleting them.
[03:01:34.860 --> 03:01:38.940]  This is explosive, and I got to tell Roger Stone something, Roger, I'm worried about
[03:01:38.940 --> 03:01:43.940]  what these corner rats are going to do, in my own gut level, but also spiritually, intellectually
[03:01:43.940 --> 03:01:46.100]  the kind of internet of souls here.
[03:01:46.100 --> 03:01:52.060]  I pick up Danger Will Robinson, yes, we're winning, it's gone from the wheels going off
[03:01:52.060 --> 03:01:57.820]  the Russia canard to an exploding like a truck bomb, but these people never give up.
[03:01:57.820 --> 03:02:03.820]  I think we're about to see, I think the president's in danger, I think we all are, they might
[03:02:03.820 --> 03:02:08.580]  set a nuke off, I mean, God knows what this rogue state's going to be, and I just think
[03:02:08.580 --> 03:02:12.660]  it's time to take the gloves off, something we probably talked about, I know the president
[03:02:12.660 --> 03:02:17.260]  had discussed, I don't know if we can get into this, but they really make a move, we're
[03:02:17.260 --> 03:02:21.220]  already kicking their ass financially, we're already winning, but they want to turn the
[03:02:21.220 --> 03:02:23.980]  table over, we can't let them do that, what are we going to do, Roger?
[03:02:23.980 --> 03:02:29.460]  No, Alex, I think you're absolutely right, look, as we have said here at Info Wars for
[03:02:29.460 --> 03:02:38.180]  some time, the entrenched political establishment had a plan A, a plan B, a plan C, and yes,
[03:02:38.180 --> 03:02:45.180]  a plan D, plan A was the electoral college and a recount, that failed.
[03:02:45.180 --> 03:02:53.020]  Plan B was the phony Russian collusion claim and the appointment by a rogue acting attorney
[03:02:53.020 --> 03:03:01.420]  general, Rod Rosenstein, of a rogue special prosecutor, and now his entire inquiry has
[03:03:01.420 --> 03:03:08.300]  been stripped bare and exposed as the partisan hit job and the completely extra judicial
[03:03:08.300 --> 03:03:16.140]  and illegal proceeding that it is, then there's plan C, the 25th amendment, I have a long
[03:03:16.140 --> 03:03:23.540]  piece up at Info Wars about that, and now we come sadly, and I think chillingly, to
[03:03:23.540 --> 03:03:26.660]  the potential of plan D.
[03:03:26.660 --> 03:03:33.100]  Why have these email messages, these text messages disappeared, because they entail
[03:03:33.100 --> 03:03:35.940]  a physical threat to the president?
[03:03:35.940 --> 03:03:45.500]  We now know that James Clapper, the NSA advisor under Obama, was looking for a way to stall
[03:03:45.500 --> 03:03:52.500]  Donald Trump's inauguration, to stop him from being sworn in with his hand on the Bible,
[03:03:52.500 --> 03:03:58.980]  and now chillingly, we know what they were talking about and what they now seek to hide,
[03:03:58.980 --> 03:04:02.860]  a physical threat to take out the president.
[03:04:02.860 --> 03:04:09.340]  The deep state is capable of anything, our history tells us this, we've already had
[03:04:09.340 --> 03:04:16.060]  two coup d'etats in this country, a violent one in the case of John F. Kennedy, a peaceful
[03:04:16.060 --> 03:04:22.340]  one in the case of Richard Nixon, and now the question is, what will they try next?
[03:04:22.340 --> 03:04:24.340]  They are capable of anything.
[03:04:24.340 --> 03:04:29.740]  Don't forget Lincoln, and the Ford Theater, and then was it Taft, who's the other one
[03:04:29.740 --> 03:04:34.180]  that got shot by the bullet, then he died of blood poisoning?
[03:04:34.180 --> 03:04:37.460]  It was Hayes, I believe, Rutherford v. Hayes.
[03:04:37.460 --> 03:04:38.460]  Let's look it up, I'm sure you're right.
[03:04:38.460 --> 03:04:39.460]  Garfield.
[03:04:39.460 --> 03:04:40.460]  Pardon me, what am I saying?
[03:04:40.460 --> 03:04:41.460]  Garfield.
[03:04:41.460 --> 03:04:42.460]  Okay, Garfield.
[03:04:42.460 --> 03:04:43.460]  Okay, there's this little same grouping there.
[03:04:43.460 --> 03:04:46.580]  So we'll be right back, tomorrow's news today, with Roger Stone.
[03:04:46.580 --> 03:04:50.740]  Democrats have been caught scheming plan D, I mean, Phil Mudd had meted it, they said
[03:04:50.740 --> 03:04:54.180]  we're going to kill him, well, see what happens, buddy.
[03:04:54.180 --> 03:05:00.500]  I'm so excited, the new product at infowarslife.com, in a glass bottle, two month servings filled
[03:05:00.500 --> 03:05:05.300]  to the brim, filled to the absolute top, the real red pill.
[03:05:05.300 --> 03:05:10.780]  This is a heart and brain pill, a new tropic that doesn't have any stimulants in it, but
[03:05:10.780 --> 03:05:13.740]  boy does it stimulate, because it's beyond that.
[03:05:13.740 --> 03:05:20.060]  Quite frankly, I just went off what I saw medical doctors prescribing to their patients,
[03:05:20.060 --> 03:05:26.380]  but it wasn't prescription, but they were charging people $100, $200 for the formulae,
[03:05:26.380 --> 03:05:31.300]  and I came up with our own formulae, working with some scientists and developers, non-GMO,
[03:05:31.300 --> 03:05:37.060]  made right here in America, 120 capsules, and ladies and gentlemen, you add the preglinone
[03:05:37.060 --> 03:05:42.500]  to it, which is the precursor to all the hormones that your body has to have to even make the
[03:05:42.500 --> 03:05:47.020]  hormones in your glands, it is amazing.
[03:05:47.020 --> 03:06:06.100]  Good pill, now available at infowarsstore.com, and your purchase fuzz the operation.
[03:06:06.100 --> 03:06:12.860]  Waging war on corruption, it's Alex Jones.
[03:06:12.860 --> 03:06:21.580]  All right, Roger Stone about to take over, but we have Phil Mudd, former counterterrorism
[03:06:21.580 --> 03:06:26.460]  head of the FBI and CIA, a Mueller protégé saying, you know, we're going to kill the
[03:06:26.460 --> 03:06:35.460]  president soon, you've got Clapper Brennan on TV, with CNN correspondent and foreign
[03:06:35.460 --> 03:06:40.820]  affairs expert, military expert, Wolf Blitzer saying, we're going to get rid of him extrajudicially
[03:06:40.820 --> 03:06:46.180]  soon, you've got hashtag on Republicans, you've got the attempt to kill the Republican leadership,
[03:06:46.180 --> 03:06:50.540]  the patriot leadership at the baseball game, their old buddies, you've got all this happening,
[03:06:50.540 --> 03:06:55.580]  but Congress knows they tried to kill him, and notice as soon as they tried to kill everybody
[03:06:55.580 --> 03:07:04.180]  and almost killed Scalise and Rand Paul, suddenly Senator Ron Johnson, suddenly Trey Gowdy,
[03:07:04.180 --> 03:07:09.700]  suddenly Jim Jordan, suddenly everybody, Nunez, everybody took the gloves off, and now there's
[03:07:09.700 --> 03:07:10.900]  no more games here.
[03:07:10.900 --> 03:07:13.940]  You're not going to go away, Hillary, you won a war, you got one.
[03:07:13.940 --> 03:07:18.300]  And so we've got these astounding clips already played, where they talk about the secret society,
[03:07:18.300 --> 03:07:22.900]  how they deleted the text messages, how they admit they have, how they don't have FBI informants
[03:07:22.900 --> 03:07:26.020]  who are FBI agents informing to Congress about this.
[03:07:26.020 --> 03:07:32.460]  I mean, do the calculus here, Forrest Roger, Trump now knows they're never going to go
[03:07:32.460 --> 03:07:36.660]  away, as I've told him many times, he knows that, he knows they're never going to stop,
[03:07:36.660 --> 03:07:40.260]  they're not going to go to elbow like Napoleon, they're not going to quit, they're dug in
[03:07:40.260 --> 03:07:44.780]  like Hitler in the right chancellery, or, you know, with what happened with the whole
[03:07:44.780 --> 03:07:49.780]  Narco situation down in Central and South America, you know, with those kingpins that
[03:07:49.780 --> 03:07:52.660]  wouldn't give up, they're not giving up.
[03:07:52.660 --> 03:07:59.260]  And now we've got the word from high level sources, it's on DrudgeReport.com, InfoWars.com,
[03:07:59.260 --> 03:08:05.060]  that they have been scheming a plan, and that the missing FBI text messages include threats
[03:08:05.060 --> 03:08:08.140]  of violence against Trump and trying to organize it.
[03:08:08.140 --> 03:08:13.100]  I mean, and I got to say, Mueller and Comey and them, these guys are crazy.
[03:08:13.100 --> 03:08:17.340]  I mean, I just can't imagine the hutzpah of this, it'd be one thing if the president
[03:08:17.340 --> 03:08:21.860]  was like a horrible guy, but I mean, the fact that he's a real American, they hate America
[03:08:21.860 --> 03:08:28.820]  so much and they love sucking off Hillary's, you know, pig pits so much that they just
[03:08:28.820 --> 03:08:33.660]  seeing in all of them, they don't get it, we beat your ass, Phil, we're going to crush
[03:08:33.660 --> 03:08:37.100]  you, we're never giving up, you sons of bitches.
[03:08:37.100 --> 03:08:41.500]  And if you want a physical fight, fill your hand as I've told you, we know you're getting
[03:08:41.500 --> 03:08:42.500]  ready to start it.
[03:08:42.500 --> 03:08:46.380]  And if you think you're getting away with any of it, we're committed, this ain't talk,
[03:08:46.380 --> 03:08:48.740]  you know it's not talk.
[03:08:48.740 --> 03:08:53.220]  Roger Takeover, I'm getting pissed here, I'm going to have to punch out here, InfoWars.com,
[03:08:53.220 --> 03:08:54.220]  go ahead.
[03:08:54.220 --> 03:08:55.220]  Alex, thank you.
[03:08:55.220 --> 03:08:56.900]  Look, I think you're absolutely right.
[03:08:56.900 --> 03:09:03.220]  You'll remember just weeks ago when I gave an interview to TMZ and I said that the American
[03:09:03.220 --> 03:09:10.100]  people will not stand for the illegitimate removal of Donald Trump through some bogus
[03:09:10.100 --> 03:09:14.180]  trumped up process, they're just not going to allow it.
[03:09:14.180 --> 03:09:19.740]  I go back to a stunning interview that Owen Schreuer did with a number of members of the
[03:09:19.740 --> 03:09:21.940]  Pipe Fitters Union.
[03:09:21.940 --> 03:09:29.900]  Let's be as clear as we possibly can because the SOBs at Media Matters just waiting to
[03:09:29.900 --> 03:09:32.420]  pervert and twist our words.
[03:09:32.420 --> 03:09:35.180]  We do not advocate violence.
[03:09:35.180 --> 03:09:37.540]  We do not countenance violence.
[03:09:37.540 --> 03:09:42.620]  We are not proposing violence, but we will not be run over.
[03:09:42.620 --> 03:09:46.040]  We will not see our Constitution shredded.
[03:09:46.040 --> 03:09:53.820]  We will not see a duly elected president removed just because Robert Mueller and James Comey
[03:09:53.820 --> 03:10:00.580]  trump up some phony process-oriented allegation against him.
[03:10:00.580 --> 03:10:07.380]  Here today on Fox, I heard a terrific interview with my friend, Judge Andrew Napolitano,
[03:10:07.380 --> 03:10:10.860]  who is sounding the clarion call.
[03:10:10.860 --> 03:10:17.860]  Under no circumstances should the president grant an interview with Robert Mueller.
[03:10:17.860 --> 03:10:21.180]  This is a perjury trap.
[03:10:21.180 --> 03:10:23.540]  Mueller is taking advantage of the fact that the president-
[03:10:23.540 --> 03:10:26.540]  He's going to say no matter what, he finds it to be perjury.
[03:10:26.540 --> 03:10:27.540]  Exactly.
[03:10:27.540 --> 03:10:32.220]  He's going to mention the violence of these people, here's a clip of Antifa shot out in
[03:10:32.220 --> 03:10:36.340]  California and then there's hours of this with young women saying they want a utopia
[03:10:36.340 --> 03:10:39.660]  and a communist program to start killing people and I know you're going to get to your whole
[03:10:39.660 --> 03:10:43.820]  point about Trump shouldn't meet with Mueller because the guy's a total fraud.
[03:10:43.820 --> 03:10:46.420]  I totally agree, but let's play this clip.
[03:10:46.420 --> 03:10:50.340]  Hey guys, it's Fleckis.
[03:10:50.340 --> 03:10:53.180]  This week we're at the women's march.
[03:10:53.180 --> 03:10:56.540]  What is the number one reason that everyone is here?
[03:10:56.540 --> 03:11:05.260]  What brings you here today?
[03:11:05.260 --> 03:11:06.260]  Everything.
[03:11:06.260 --> 03:11:07.260]  Look at these zombies.
[03:11:07.260 --> 03:11:09.260]  Basically everything that he stands on as a platform, to be honest.
[03:11:09.260 --> 03:11:11.620]  I had the three times I've been here with Trump so far.
[03:11:11.620 --> 03:11:17.540]  Well, I work for a tribe for a lot of time, so about five years, so a lot of negativity
[03:11:17.540 --> 03:11:25.380]  towards the tribes, I'm not down with that, and also, you know, just the bulls***.
[03:11:25.380 --> 03:11:27.140]  What are you protesting Trump for?
[03:11:27.140 --> 03:11:30.900]  You know, he's a conservative, I don't like conservatism.
[03:11:30.900 --> 03:11:37.100]  I got ahead of people because of my position as a white male, I think that my position
[03:11:37.100 --> 03:11:39.660]  as a white male, I agree I'm bad.
[03:11:39.660 --> 03:11:45.020]  This is a power to say something, like myself, and I think that's what's going to help change
[03:11:45.020 --> 03:11:46.020]  things.
[03:11:46.020 --> 03:11:47.020]  I think I'll fake this guy.
[03:11:47.020 --> 03:11:48.020]  What did your sign say?
[03:11:48.020 --> 03:11:51.580]  It says kill Donald Trump, and then it says kill Mike Pence, and then it says it's guillotine
[03:11:51.580 --> 03:11:52.580]  time, bitches.
[03:11:52.580 --> 03:12:00.620]  He's like repealed all these protective sort of stuff that's supposed to protect immigrants
[03:12:00.620 --> 03:12:03.060]  in this country.
[03:12:03.060 --> 03:12:09.460]  It's like so hypocritical, too, and I mean-
[03:12:09.460 --> 03:12:12.780]  Do you think we need any immigration reform, though?
[03:12:12.780 --> 03:12:13.780]  Hit pause real quick.
[03:12:13.780 --> 03:12:18.660]  No, she's got a Planned Parenthood shirt on, which you can all be for whatever you believe
[03:12:18.660 --> 03:12:20.260]  about, birth control, whatever.
[03:12:20.260 --> 03:12:23.660]  Planned Parenthood is eugenics, and was the main advisor to Adolf Hitler.
[03:12:23.660 --> 03:12:27.220]  So they're calling everybody Nazis, and she's wearing a Hitler shirt.
[03:12:27.220 --> 03:12:28.220]  Here, let's go back.
[03:12:28.220 --> 03:12:30.300]  I don't want to, I don't know, I don't want to speak on that.
[03:12:30.300 --> 03:12:31.820]  What does that, what does it mean?
[03:12:31.820 --> 03:12:37.060]  I think that we should kill Donald Trump, and then we should also kill Mike Pence because
[03:12:37.060 --> 03:12:38.860]  I wouldn't want him in office either.
[03:12:38.860 --> 03:12:44.060]  I'm not against an outsider, per se, but I don't think that because you're an outsider,
[03:12:44.060 --> 03:12:45.740]  therefore you're qualified.
[03:12:45.740 --> 03:12:47.460]  What do you think makes Trump very unqualified?
[03:12:47.460 --> 03:12:49.260]  He's never been president.
[03:12:49.260 --> 03:12:54.540]  I'm not here to support somebody's capitalist trying to make money off of the struggles
[03:12:54.540 --> 03:12:59.380]  of women and women of color and people of color in this country.
[03:12:59.380 --> 03:13:00.380]  I'm actually upset.
[03:13:00.380 --> 03:13:05.660]  What is your ideal, political or social structure?
[03:13:05.660 --> 03:13:10.460]  Communist utopia, but I mean that's pretty hard to do.
[03:13:10.460 --> 03:13:14.780]  I mean, they're just lazy girls, probably never had a job, bows of the clown.
[03:13:14.780 --> 03:13:16.140]  We're going to kill everybody.
[03:13:16.140 --> 03:13:17.140]  It's cute.
[03:13:17.140 --> 03:13:21.900]  Until the killer, until the killing, yeah, yeah, nice hair, Roger Skype Springer, we're
[03:13:21.900 --> 03:13:27.900]  going to go back to him in a minute, but looking at this here, this guy goes, well, he's never
[03:13:27.900 --> 03:13:28.900]  qualified.
[03:13:28.900 --> 03:13:29.900]  He's never been president.
[03:13:29.900 --> 03:13:30.900]  He is president.
[03:13:30.900 --> 03:13:35.140]  He's more qualified than he ran the first time against all odds and one, but they don't
[03:13:35.140 --> 03:13:36.140]  even know.
[03:13:36.140 --> 03:13:40.380]  I mean, everything they say is a cliche unintentional humor because these people are the biggest
[03:13:40.380 --> 03:13:45.860]  losers on the planet and now they want a physical war with us and attack our reporters all over
[03:13:45.860 --> 03:13:50.980]  the country and they'll punch you and you punch them, they freak out and call the police.
[03:13:50.980 --> 03:13:53.060]  They're literally in law on land, Roger.
[03:13:53.060 --> 03:13:56.800]  Yeah, that was an extremely telling video.
[03:13:56.800 --> 03:14:03.340]  She's for a communist utopia without knowing how many people that that has murdered.
[03:14:03.340 --> 03:14:09.640]  Look, the left is in the tizzy, but as you've pointed out again and again, these street
[03:14:09.640 --> 03:14:15.540]  activities are the backdrop for a political takedown of the president.
[03:14:15.540 --> 03:14:18.620]  I don't think the situation could be any clearer.
[03:14:18.620 --> 03:14:25.700]  Robert Mueller seeks to euker the president to box him into some kind of obstruction charge,
[03:14:25.700 --> 03:14:31.340]  taking advantage of his low quasciousness and the fact that he's never a man that has
[03:14:31.340 --> 03:14:33.780]  a paucity of words.
[03:14:33.780 --> 03:14:37.020]  They know the case that they're structuring against the president.
[03:14:37.020 --> 03:14:40.060]  The president doesn't know.
[03:14:40.060 --> 03:14:42.020]  This is a suicide mission.
[03:14:42.020 --> 03:14:44.020]  This is a death wish.
[03:14:44.020 --> 03:14:45.180]  It's a setup.
[03:14:45.180 --> 03:14:46.180]  It's a trap.
[03:14:46.180 --> 03:14:47.180]  I know you know that.
[03:14:47.180 --> 03:14:49.420]  I know you talk to the president occasionally.
[03:14:49.420 --> 03:14:52.020]  How has he been maneuvered into this fiasco?
[03:14:52.020 --> 03:14:55.620]  Well, it hasn't happened until it's happened.
[03:14:55.620 --> 03:15:01.020]  Where we are now is his lawyers are negotiating with the special prosecutor.
[03:15:01.020 --> 03:15:05.300]  We're told that some portion of the interview might be live.
[03:15:05.300 --> 03:15:11.300]  Some portion of it might be in writing, responding to written questions.
[03:15:11.300 --> 03:15:17.020]  Here I guess is the point, when you look at the laws that have been broken by Mueller
[03:15:17.020 --> 03:15:19.300]  and Comey, they pay out in comparison.
[03:15:19.300 --> 03:15:20.300]  No, exactly.
[03:15:20.300 --> 03:15:23.980]  Why would you have Jeffrey Dahmer or Charlie Manson out of prison go interview the president?
[03:15:23.980 --> 03:15:28.180]  I mean, Mueller should be locked up right now for all the crimes and things he's done.
[03:15:28.180 --> 03:15:29.860]  Not be interviewing our president.
[03:15:29.860 --> 03:15:36.700]  He's a Clinton stool attendant, a groom of the stool that worships Hillary Clinton's
[03:15:36.700 --> 03:15:37.700]  feces.
[03:15:37.700 --> 03:15:38.700]  I mean, that's what he does.
[03:15:38.700 --> 03:15:39.700]  He worships crime.
[03:15:39.700 --> 03:15:40.700]  He worships evil.
[03:15:40.700 --> 03:15:44.820]  All criminal operations have been caught and he seems to go back into a rattle somewhere
[03:15:44.820 --> 03:15:47.620]  and suck on Hillary Clinton's poisonous snake teeth.
[03:15:47.620 --> 03:15:49.220]  Well, they ride back with Roger Stone.
[03:15:49.220 --> 03:15:50.700]  By the way, I just trolled the media right there.
[03:15:50.700 --> 03:15:52.500]  That'll be in the news today.
[03:15:52.500 --> 03:15:57.860]  The answer to being in control of your own health care is freedom from insurance.
[03:15:57.860 --> 03:16:01.940]  Become part of a group of self-pay patients that come together to share in each other's
[03:16:01.940 --> 03:16:03.700]  medical expenses.
[03:16:03.700 --> 03:16:08.660]  Individual share amounts begin at $107 a month and $347 for families.
[03:16:08.660 --> 03:16:10.780]  This is from three health sharing programs.
[03:16:10.780 --> 03:16:12.860]  Holistic treatments may be eligible for sharing.
[03:16:12.860 --> 03:16:13.860]  See guidelines.
[03:16:13.860 --> 03:16:17.100]  Discount programs available for dental, vision, and pharmacy.

[03:16:29.940 --> 03:16:30.940]  I use some.

[03:16:31.940 --> 03:16:32.940]  Awesome.

[03:16:37.540 --> 03:16:38.540]  Bacon.

[03:16:54.540 --> 03:16:59.100]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected
[03:16:59.100 --> 03:17:01.340]  by you, but the symptoms are there.
[03:17:01.340 --> 03:17:06.260]  Loss of energy, blood sugar, spikes, and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat
[03:17:06.260 --> 03:17:09.900]  are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.

[03:17:15.620 --> 03:17:17.460]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[03:17:17.460 --> 03:17:19.940]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[03:17:19.940 --> 03:17:22.980]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look, and I'm telling everyone how much
[03:17:22.980 --> 03:17:23.980]  healthier I feel.

[03:17:58.180 --> 03:18:02.140]  Digestive enzymes assist in the digestive process and increase the bioavailability of
[03:18:02.140 --> 03:18:05.500]  nutrients by breaking down foods into easily absorbable components.
[03:18:05.500 --> 03:18:09.780]  They also help prevent discomfort from indigestion caused by fermentation of undigested food
[03:18:09.780 --> 03:18:11.620]  particles in the gut.
[03:18:11.620 --> 03:18:14.060]  Digestive enzyme production declines as we age.
[03:18:14.060 --> 03:18:18.140]  Carnivore is filled with digestive enzymes like those naturally present in the body.

[03:18:25.740 --> 03:18:28.540]  commonly associated with high meat diets.
[03:18:28.540 --> 03:18:32.740]  Just one pill with every high protein meal helps increase the bioavailability and absorption
[03:18:32.740 --> 03:18:36.740]  of amino acids, the building blocks to your muscles.

[03:20:20.380 --> 03:20:21.380]  Welcome back.
[03:20:21.380 --> 03:20:24.060]  You're at Freedom Command Central.
[03:20:24.060 --> 03:20:25.060]  That's right.
[03:20:25.060 --> 03:20:31.860]  It's the Alex Jones show, and sitting in for Alex Jones, your genial host, Roger Stone.
[03:20:31.860 --> 03:20:39.100]  I tuned into MSNBC last night, probably one of the 10 or 11 people who were watching,
[03:20:39.100 --> 03:20:47.140]  to watch Lawrence O'Donnell, who appeared not to be sober, go into a harangue against
[03:20:47.140 --> 03:20:49.060]  yours truly.
[03:20:49.060 --> 03:20:56.060]  I'm not exaggerating when I tell you that he used my name 40 times in a 5-minute clip,
[03:20:56.420 --> 03:21:02.260]  and his objection, well, it was because I was quoted in yesterday's Washington Post
[03:21:02.260 --> 03:21:09.380]  as saying that under no circumstances whatsoever should President Trump grant an interview
[03:21:09.380 --> 03:21:12.100]  to Robert Mueller.
[03:21:12.100 --> 03:21:19.100]  I was disappointed to hear that Attorney General Jeff Sessions granted Mueller an interview,
[03:21:19.620 --> 03:21:25.460]  but then pretty much everything Jeff Sessions does disappoints me these days.
[03:21:25.460 --> 03:21:31.940]  But now it's absolutely clear that what Mueller seeks to do is to euker the president into
[03:21:31.940 --> 03:21:35.700]  some process-oriented charge.
[03:21:35.700 --> 03:21:42.700]  In other words, having spent literally hundreds of millions of dollars in a sham investigation
[03:21:43.140 --> 03:21:50.140]  into Russian collusion, Mueller has produced no evidence whatsoever that the Russian state
[03:21:50.620 --> 03:21:57.220]  conspired, coordinated, or colluded with Donald Trump and his campaign, or his campaign, to
[03:21:57.220 --> 03:22:02.340]  affect the outcome of the 2016 election.
[03:22:02.340 --> 03:22:09.340]  But compared to some bogus, pardon the expression, trumped up charge that Mueller might manufacture,
[03:22:10.420 --> 03:22:17.420]  let's look at the charges that Mr. Mueller, and Mr. Comey, and Mr. McCabe, and Mr. Rosenstein
[03:22:18.460 --> 03:22:20.860]  would be facing.
[03:22:20.860 --> 03:22:27.340]  Violation of 18 U.S. Code 242, deprivation of rights under color of law.
[03:22:27.340 --> 03:22:34.340]  Violation of 18 U.S. Code 871, threats against the president and successors to the presidency.
[03:22:34.980 --> 03:22:41.620]  Violation of 18 U.S. Code 1510, obstruction of criminal investigation.
[03:22:41.620 --> 03:22:46.620]  Violation of 18 U.S. Code 2381, treason.
[03:22:46.620 --> 03:22:53.620]  Violation of 18 U.S. Code 2384, seditious conspiracy.
[03:22:53.620 --> 03:23:00.620]  Violation of 18 U.S. Code 2385, advocating the overthrow of the government.
[03:23:03.740 --> 03:23:10.460]  Penalties for these crimes are quite severe, in some cases they include capital punishment.
[03:23:10.460 --> 03:23:14.100]  So the game of chicken has begun.
[03:23:14.100 --> 03:23:20.540]  The president needs to recognize that he has the whip hand in this proceeding.
[03:23:20.540 --> 03:23:27.540]  He has the justice department, and if he had a cognizant active attorney general who understood
[03:23:29.460 --> 03:23:36.460]  the breadth of this conspiracy, he would have the initiative.
[03:23:36.460 --> 03:23:43.460]  Unfortunately, there is still no evidence that sleepy Jeff Sessions will do his job under
[03:23:43.460 --> 03:23:50.460]  the Constitution. There is no evidence that he is ready to proceed.
[03:23:50.460 --> 03:24:01.460]  And therefore, in my view, the unsung heroes to date are Congressman Matt Gaetz, Congressman Jim Jordan,
[03:24:01.460 --> 03:24:07.460]  Congressman Trey Gowdy, Congressman Ron DeSantis.
[03:24:07.460 --> 03:24:14.460]  Thanks to these gutsy congressmen, true patriots, every one of them, the entire cover-up and
[03:24:15.780 --> 03:24:22.780]  partisan nature of Robert Mueller's bogus inquiry is strip naked for everyone to see.
[03:24:24.780 --> 03:24:31.780]  How long will this charade go on? We here at InfoWars have been very clear in what we
[03:24:31.780 --> 03:24:36.780]  think is the right course of action.
[03:24:36.780 --> 03:24:42.780]  The president should fire Mr. Rosenstein forthwith.
[03:24:42.780 --> 03:24:49.780]  He has caused the relationship between Rosenstein and Mueller, where Mueller gave Rosenstein
[03:24:50.780 --> 03:24:55.780]  his first position in public service, is a conflict of interest.
[03:24:55.780 --> 03:25:02.780]  Having dispatched Mr. Rosenstein, the president must give a direct order to his attorney general
[03:25:04.780 --> 03:25:11.780]  for the appointment of a special prosecutor in the matter of Uranium One.
[03:25:11.780 --> 03:25:22.780]  How ironic that Mueller, Comey, McCabe, and Rosenstein, the very four men seeking to remove the president,
[03:25:22.780 --> 03:25:29.780]  are up to their knees in the corruption of Uranium One.
[03:25:30.780 --> 03:25:37.780]  Uranium One, you can go to the InfoWars.com site and see a 5,000-word piece that I wrote there
[03:25:38.780 --> 03:25:43.780]  outlining the etymology of this treasonous crime.
[03:25:43.780 --> 03:25:50.780]  This is the biggest, from a financial point of view, treasonous financial crime in U.S. history.
[03:25:50.780 --> 03:25:57.780]  And the role of those four gentlemen is absolutely clear.
[03:25:57.780 --> 03:26:01.780]  So the path forward here is obvious.
[03:26:01.780 --> 03:26:09.780]  The president has the power to save himself, to save the Constitution, to save the republic,
[03:26:09.780 --> 03:26:14.780]  to save the results of the 2016 elections.
[03:26:14.780 --> 03:26:22.780]  Will he do so in time, or will he be lulled to sleep by second-rate lawyers
[03:26:22.780 --> 03:26:30.780]  who tell him to march into an inquiry with Robert Mueller that can only end badly?
[03:26:30.780 --> 03:26:35.780]  Today, my friend Judge Andrew Napolitano gave an incredible interview
[03:26:35.780 --> 03:26:42.780]  in which he outlined all of the reasons why the president must resist the invitation
[03:26:42.780 --> 03:26:50.780]  to essentially set himself up for an obstruction or a perjury rap.
[03:26:50.780 --> 03:26:57.780]  The fact that Mr. Mueller is now focused on the dismissal of General Flynn
[03:26:57.780 --> 03:27:06.780]  and the dismissal of Mr. Comey tells me that when it comes to Russian collusion, he has nothing.
[03:27:06.780 --> 03:27:13.780]  We have gone full cycle here, even though it has cost the taxpayers millions.
[03:27:13.780 --> 03:27:16.780]  Let me be absolutely clear.
[03:27:16.780 --> 03:27:19.780]  The president should fire Rosenstein.
[03:27:19.780 --> 03:27:25.780]  He should pardon General Flynn, and he should challenge Mr. Mueller.
[03:27:25.780 --> 03:27:28.780]  There is no better path forward.
[03:27:28.780 --> 03:27:32.780]  Again, at the risk of sounding like a broken record,
[03:27:32.780 --> 03:27:39.780]  under no circumstances should the president submit to an interview with Mr. Mueller.
[03:27:39.780 --> 03:27:44.780]  Now, if you're enjoying the expanded programming here at InfoWars,
[03:27:44.780 --> 03:27:49.780]  if you like David Knight with real news in the morning, as I do,
[03:27:49.780 --> 03:27:55.780]  if you enjoy the Alex Jones show midday and you're digging on the war room

[03:27:59.780 --> 03:28:06.780]  I recognize that this expanded programming is only possible through viewer and listener support.
[03:28:06.780 --> 03:28:13.780]  We don't have any corporatist benefactors who subsidize our operations here at InfoWars.

[03:28:34.780 --> 03:28:42.780]  This is the very best immune, all-natural immune formula on the market today.
[03:28:42.780 --> 03:28:48.780]  And with the flu surrounding us, there is no better deal on the InfoWars site.
[03:28:48.780 --> 03:28:52.780]  Folks, go to the site now. We need your help.
[03:28:52.780 --> 03:28:55.780]  It's a no-brainer. A big Berkey water filter is the one you need, period.
[03:28:55.780 --> 03:29:00.780]  You need a water filter that removes chlorine, fluoride, pharmaceuticals, BPA, and other endocrine disruptors,
[03:29:00.780 --> 03:29:03.780]  pesticides, bacteria, viruses, and much more, right?
[03:29:03.780 --> 03:29:05.780]  And does it all at only 2 cents per gallon.

[03:29:21.780 --> 03:29:26.780]  The answer to being in control of your own healthcare is freedom from insurance.
[03:29:26.780 --> 03:29:32.780]  Become part of a group of self-pay patients that come together to share in each other's medical expenses.
[03:29:32.780 --> 03:29:37.780]  Individual share amounts begin at $107 a month and $347 for families.
[03:29:37.780 --> 03:29:39.780]  Choose from three health sharing programs.
[03:29:39.780 --> 03:29:41.780]  Holistic treatments may be eligible for sharing.
[03:29:41.780 --> 03:29:42.780]  See guidelines.
[03:29:42.780 --> 03:29:46.780]  Discount programs available for dental, vision, and pharmacy.
[03:29:46.780 --> 03:29:51.780]  Go to libertyoncall.org. That's libertyoncall.org.
[03:30:16.780 --> 03:30:19.780]  Right now are absolutely amazing.

[03:31:16.780 --> 03:31:22.780]  Mouthwash features natural oils and ancient ingredients used since Aboriginal and Biblical times.
[03:31:22.780 --> 03:31:27.780]  Instead of containing fluoride, our super blue line is loaded with a good halogen iodine
[03:31:27.780 --> 03:31:32.780]  and an array of other beneficial compounds that have been hand selected for their oral health benefits.
[03:31:32.780 --> 03:31:39.780]  Super blue, fluoride-free mouthwash and toothpaste are the first and only to contain all of these natural ingredients.
[03:31:39.780 --> 03:31:42.780]  Xylitol, nano silver, and iodine.
[03:31:42.780 --> 03:31:46.780]  What is the difference with our super blue fluoride-free products?
[03:31:46.780 --> 03:31:51.780]  Refresh your breath and invigorate your oral health routine at infowarscore.com.

[03:31:53.780 --> 03:31:56.780]  Frank in North Carolina, thanks for holding so long. Go ahead.
[03:31:56.780 --> 03:31:58.780]  Yeah, I just have to say something, man.
[03:31:58.780 --> 03:32:02.780]  It seems like every time I turn on your broadcast, you're bragging.
[03:32:02.780 --> 03:32:03.780]  It just gets old, man.
[03:32:03.780 --> 03:32:05.780]  I'm going to shut you down right now, okay?
[03:32:05.780 --> 03:32:08.780]  We're taking calls about your nomination.
[03:32:08.780 --> 03:32:12.780]  Do you understand they're having congressional hearings trying to shut us down?
[03:32:12.780 --> 03:32:15.780]  Do you understand I'm ringing the alarm?
[03:32:15.780 --> 03:32:18.780]  If that was happening to anybody else, I'd be freaked out.
[03:32:18.780 --> 03:32:20.780]  I mean, what's it going to take us being shut down?
[03:32:20.780 --> 03:32:22.780]  Is that what you want, Frank?
[03:32:22.780 --> 03:32:23.780]  You know what, Alex?
[03:32:23.780 --> 03:32:24.780]  I'll put it on pause again.
[03:32:24.780 --> 03:32:27.780]  Hey, Frank, do you understand it's not bragging to say,
[03:32:27.780 --> 03:32:30.780]  we are the tip of the spear, we're under attack, we need your help.
[03:32:30.780 --> 03:32:35.780]  As much bagging as I do, we can barely pay the bills and grow in the face of this.
[03:32:35.780 --> 03:32:38.780]  I'm not going to just stop growth and let them start pushing us backwards.
[03:32:38.780 --> 03:32:40.780]  Do you understand? I need your help, Frank.
[03:32:40.780 --> 03:32:42.780]  I need your help, Frank.
[03:32:42.780 --> 03:32:48.780]  Go to infowarstore.com right now and help fund the info war.
[03:32:48.780 --> 03:32:50.780]  Do you understand? I need your help, Frank.
[03:32:50.780 --> 03:33:05.780]  Free press needs your help, Frank.
[03:33:20.780 --> 03:33:26.780]  Welcome back.
[03:33:26.780 --> 03:33:32.780]  I'm your host, Roger Stone, and you are on the Alex Jones show.
[03:33:32.780 --> 03:33:37.780]  We here at Info Wars are inordinately proud of the fact that we have been consistently
[03:33:37.780 --> 03:33:40.780]  bringing you tomorrow's news today.
[03:33:40.780 --> 03:33:46.780]  We have got a now long established track record of telling you in advance what's
[03:33:46.780 --> 03:33:49.780]  about to break in the mainstream media.
[03:33:49.780 --> 03:33:56.780]  So it's no surprise that our long time listeners have lost faith with the FBI.
[03:33:56.780 --> 03:34:03.780]  You know, when I was growing up, the FBI was revered as an honest law enforcement
[03:34:03.780 --> 03:34:07.780]  organization of extraordinary integrity.
[03:34:07.780 --> 03:34:13.780]  J. Edgar Hoover's book, The Masters of Deceit, was the textbook given out in the
[03:34:13.780 --> 03:34:19.780]  public schools to explain the dangers of communism and the way they sought to
[03:34:19.780 --> 03:34:21.780]  subvert our democracy.
[03:34:21.780 --> 03:34:26.780]  Well, today, sadly, thanks to Mr. Comey and Mr. Mueller,
[03:34:26.780 --> 03:34:32.780]  mainstream America no longer holds the Bureau in such high regard.
[03:34:32.780 --> 03:34:38.780]  A new poll released by Rasmussen, a respected survey research firm,
[03:34:38.780 --> 03:34:47.780]  shows that 49% of likely U.S. voters believe that a special prosecutor
[03:34:47.780 --> 03:34:53.780]  should be named to investigate senior FBI officials and their handling of
[03:34:53.780 --> 03:34:58.780]  Hillary Clinton and their abuse of Donald Trump.
[03:34:58.780 --> 03:35:06.780]  Only 31% of voters disagreed, with a staggering 19% undecided.
[03:35:06.780 --> 03:35:11.780]  As this story develops, I predict that the number of those seeking a
[03:35:11.780 --> 03:35:17.780]  special prosecutor or favoring the appointment of one will only grow.
[03:35:17.780 --> 03:35:20.780]  You heard it here first on Infowars.
[03:35:20.780 --> 03:35:24.780]  We have been advocating the appointment of a special counsel to look into
[03:35:24.780 --> 03:35:27.780]  Uranium One for months.
[03:35:27.780 --> 03:35:32.780]  Again, Infowars, tomorrow's news today.
[03:35:32.780 --> 03:35:38.780]  I can't help but chuckle to see Chuck Schumer, the glad-handing
[03:35:38.780 --> 03:35:44.780]  semi-glick of American politics, get some of his just desserts.
[03:35:44.780 --> 03:35:49.780]  Having virtually destroyed the credibility of the Democratic Party
[03:35:49.780 --> 03:35:55.780]  by staging a government shutdown in which, incredibly, he argued that
[03:35:55.780 --> 03:36:00.780]  funding for people in this country illegally was more important than
[03:36:00.780 --> 03:36:06.780]  the paychecks of our men and women in the front lines of military service.
[03:36:06.780 --> 03:36:13.780]  They now have so completely whipsawed the Democratic Party that the
[03:36:13.780 --> 03:36:19.780]  illegal aliens and those advocating amnesty have stormed Chuck's
[03:36:19.780 --> 03:36:22.780]  palatial New York City home.
[03:36:22.780 --> 03:36:28.780]  They no longer are satisfied with the extension of DACA, the so-called
[03:36:28.780 --> 03:36:33.780]  defer action for childhood arrivals, but now they are demanding full
[03:36:33.780 --> 03:36:35.780]  amnesty.
[03:36:35.780 --> 03:36:38.780]  I have four words for the dreamers.
[03:36:38.780 --> 03:36:41.780]  Not gonna happen.
[03:36:41.780 --> 03:36:43.780]  Not going to happen.
[03:36:43.780 --> 03:36:44.780]  That's four words.
[03:36:44.780 --> 03:36:48.780]  While the American people are undoubtedly the most generous people in the
[03:36:48.780 --> 03:36:54.780]  world, while we export billions of dollars in foreign aid to countries
[03:36:54.780 --> 03:37:00.780]  big and small, everything has a limit, including the patience of the
[03:37:00.780 --> 03:37:02.780]  American people.
[03:37:02.780 --> 03:37:05.780]  Our limit was reached some time ago.
[03:37:05.780 --> 03:37:06.780]  Now, let there be no doubt.
[03:37:06.780 --> 03:37:08.780]  We need immigrants.
[03:37:08.780 --> 03:37:14.780]  Our country was built on immigrants, legal ones that add to our society
[03:37:14.780 --> 03:37:17.780]  and become productive American citizens.
[03:37:17.780 --> 03:37:22.780]  That's why our country's immigration policies need to be revamped top to
[03:37:22.780 --> 03:37:29.780]  bottom and these endless chain immigration put an end to the H1B
[03:37:29.780 --> 03:37:32.780]  visas that take jobs from our graduates.
[03:37:32.780 --> 03:37:37.780]  These are just a few things, a few fundamental reforms that we need.
[03:37:37.780 --> 03:37:44.780]  There can be no rewarding of illegal behavior while those who have gone
[03:37:44.780 --> 03:37:49.780]  through the process who are going by the book wait patiently in line for
[03:37:49.780 --> 03:37:51.780]  their citizenship.
[03:37:51.780 --> 03:37:56.780]  As for Chuck Schumer, I guess he didn't get much sleep last night as the
[03:37:56.780 --> 03:38:03.780]  protesters were chanting outside his palatial Manhattan apartment.
[03:38:03.780 --> 03:38:08.780]  If Chuck won't let us dream, we won't let him sleep.
[03:38:08.780 --> 03:38:11.780]  Well, you won't be sleeping much, Chuck.
[03:38:11.780 --> 03:38:13.780]  You made your bed.
[03:38:13.780 --> 03:38:16.780]  Now try to sleep in it.
[03:38:16.780 --> 03:38:22.780]  I do want to bring your attention to an extraordinary, there we have the
[03:38:22.780 --> 03:38:27.780]  protesters outside Chuck Schumer's palatial apartment.
[03:38:27.780 --> 03:38:33.780]  As we have reported, the president has named Jeff Berman as the U.S.
[03:38:33.780 --> 03:38:37.780]  attorney for the Southern District of New York.
[03:38:37.780 --> 03:38:44.780]  Mr. Berman, an associate of former mayor and U.S. attorney, Rudy Giuliani
[03:38:44.780 --> 03:38:49.780]  has a long and distinguished legal career and is eminently qualified for
[03:38:49.780 --> 03:38:51.780]  this position.
[03:38:51.780 --> 03:38:58.780]  But lo and behold, Democratic Senator Kirsten Gillibrand has put a hold on
[03:38:58.780 --> 03:39:00.780]  his nomination.
[03:39:00.780 --> 03:39:06.780]  Mr. Berman now serves in the position of U.S. attorney and can do so legally
[03:39:06.780 --> 03:39:13.780]  for 128 days before the president must either put his nomination to a vote or
[03:39:13.780 --> 03:39:18.780]  I should say Mitch McConnell shall or withdraw the nomination.
[03:39:18.780 --> 03:39:24.780]  Incredibly, Senator Gillibrand has announced that she will blue slip the
[03:39:24.780 --> 03:39:30.780]  nomination and, sadly, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Chuck
[03:39:30.780 --> 03:39:34.780]  Grassley, has announced that he will honor that blue slip.
[03:39:34.780 --> 03:39:40.780]  What is Ms. Gillibrand's objection to the appointment of an honest prosecutor
[03:39:40.780 --> 03:39:45.780]  in Manhattan? Well, quite simply, that Mr. Berman's law firm has done work
[03:39:45.780 --> 03:39:50.780]  for Deutsche Bank and Deutsche Bank has been a lender to the Trump
[03:39:50.780 --> 03:39:54.780]  organization for their real estate projects.
[03:39:54.780 --> 03:39:59.780]  There's no accusation of illegality or nothing inappropriate.
[03:39:59.780 --> 03:40:05.780]  The sad truth is that Kirsten Gillibrand will oppose any appointment by
[03:40:05.780 --> 03:40:08.780]  Donald Trump for an honest prosecutor.
[03:40:08.780 --> 03:40:14.780]  Why? Quite simply, a first year law student can take a list of Senator
[03:40:14.780 --> 03:40:19.780]  Chuck Schumer's contributors and his votes in the United States Senate
[03:40:19.780 --> 03:40:26.780]  and marry them. He is the greatest single recipient of special interest
[03:40:26.780 --> 03:40:33.780]  money in the U.S. Senate. Chuck Schumer, quite sadly, is a for sale and
[03:40:33.780 --> 03:40:38.780]  everyone in the U.S. Senate knows it. God forbid that a prosecutor might
[03:40:38.780 --> 03:40:43.780]  know it. And therefore, Senator Gillibrand, who is merely a sock puppet
[03:40:43.780 --> 03:40:48.780]  for Senator Schumer, thwarts the appointment of an honest prosecutor
[03:40:48.780 --> 03:40:53.780]  in Manhattan. Shame on you, Senator, shame on you.
[03:40:53.780 --> 03:40:59.780]  We beseech Senator Grassley to ignore her blue slip as he has done for
[03:40:59.780 --> 03:41:04.780]  a number of judicial appointments and give the people an honest prosecutor

[03:43:13.780 --> 03:43:18.780]  energy, low sex drive and muscle loss. Alpha Power is packed with some of the

[03:43:51.780 --> 03:43:55.780]  You know, I've got some talking points here about caveman from InfoWarsLife.com
[03:43:55.780 --> 03:43:58.780]  but instead of going with those talking points, let me just give you what I've
[03:43:58.780 --> 03:44:02.780]  experienced personally. From all the wives, tales and every culture, we know
[03:44:02.780 --> 03:44:06.780]  that the bones have the essence. We know chicken noodle soup is great for people
[03:44:06.780 --> 03:44:10.780]  that are sick. Again, in every culture, this has been reported because it
[03:44:10.780 --> 03:44:16.780]  works and there's no way to quantify how strong this is but the amount of bone
[03:44:16.780 --> 03:44:22.780]  protein and the amount of marrow and the amount of concentrated life force that
[03:44:22.780 --> 03:44:27.780]  is in this is incredible. Ladies and gentlemen, whether it's for your joints,
[03:44:27.780 --> 03:44:31.780]  whether it's for your arteries and your veins, whether it's for your brain,
[03:44:31.780 --> 03:44:36.780]  whether it's for energy, this, ladies and gentlemen, is the strongest, most
[03:44:36.780 --> 03:44:41.780]  concentrated bone broth formula out there and it's amazing.
[03:44:41.780 --> 03:44:45.780]  Find out for yourself today at InfoWarsStore.com. What do you do for your family?
[03:44:45.780 --> 03:44:48.780]  And again, I want to thank you all for your support. You are funding the
[03:44:48.780 --> 03:44:52.780]  Information War in 2018.
[03:44:52.780 --> 03:44:56.780]  InfoWarsLife is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine. We have
[03:44:56.780 --> 03:45:00.780]  found extraordinary new natural way to help alleviate seasonal distress
[03:45:00.780 --> 03:45:05.780]  symptoms including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort and
[03:45:05.780 --> 03:45:10.780]  respiratory health and normal breathing. This is pollen blood. In the 1960s
[03:45:10.780 --> 03:45:14.780]  researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs from
[03:45:14.780 --> 03:45:18.780]  specific farms experienced less seasonal distress symptoms like runny nose,
[03:45:18.780 --> 03:45:23.780]  itchy watery eyes and excessive mucus production. They began studying the
[03:45:23.780 --> 03:45:27.780]  effects in published trials, in their published trials. Now we are introducing
[03:45:27.780 --> 03:45:32.780]  the fruit of the research, a fast-acting chewable tablet, just two, two tablets
[03:45:32.780 --> 03:45:37.780]  at the first sign of seasonal distress and fast-acting pollen block starts
[03:45:37.780 --> 03:45:41.780]  working in about 15 minutes to help alleviate seasonal distress. Enjoy the air
[03:45:41.780 --> 03:45:45.780]  you breathe naturally with fast-acting pollen block available now at

[03:45:52.780 --> 03:45:56.780]  Introducing Floralife, the new probiotic line developed exclusively
[03:45:56.780 --> 03:46:01.780]  by InfoWarsLife after years of research on the human microbiome. Not all
[03:46:01.780 --> 03:46:05.780]  probiotics are made the same. Floralife probiotics use a unique targeted
[03:46:05.780 --> 03:46:09.780]  delivery system that bypasses the stomach and releases directly into the
[03:46:09.780 --> 03:46:13.780]  intestines for maximum effect. This is critical because stomach acid kills
[03:46:13.780 --> 03:46:17.780]  most probiotics so if you don't have a targeted delivery probiotic then
[03:46:17.780 --> 03:46:21.780]  you're cheating your gut health and your wallet. Floralife supports your
[03:46:21.780 --> 03:46:25.780]  body's core where you need it most including digestion, regularity,
[03:46:25.780 --> 03:46:29.780]  the gut lining and metabolism. Did you know that over 80% of your
[03:46:29.780 --> 03:46:33.780]  immune system is located in your gut? That's why increasing gut probiotic
[03:46:33.780 --> 03:46:37.780]  levels is so important for overall health. Floralife is sold as a 15
[03:46:37.780 --> 03:46:41.780]  billion probiotic for everyday maintenance care and a 50 billion probiotic
[03:46:41.780 --> 03:46:44.780]  for a 30-day advanced gut restoration program. Head to
[03:46:44.780 --> 03:46:48.780]  InfoWarsLife.com to pick up your bottle of Floralife probiotics today.
[03:46:48.780 --> 03:46:55.780]  That's InfoWarsLife.com
[03:46:55.780 --> 03:47:00.780]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[03:47:00.780 --> 03:47:05.780]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, you're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[03:47:05.780 --> 03:47:30.780]  And now your host, Roger Stone.
[03:47:30.780 --> 03:47:35.780]  Welcome back. I'm Roger Stone sitting in for Alex Jones.
[03:47:35.780 --> 03:47:42.780]  There's been much discussion in recent days about not only the four-page
[03:47:42.780 --> 03:47:47.780]  memo which Democrats on the House Intelligence Committee have stoutly
[03:47:47.780 --> 03:47:55.780]  refused to let the American people see and the ten-page memo which outlines
[03:47:55.780 --> 03:48:01.780]  the entire trail of treason and conspiracy that was revealed yesterday
[03:48:01.780 --> 03:48:10.780]  here at InfoWars. Now, Judge Andrew Napolitano, my friend of almost 30 years,
[03:48:10.780 --> 03:48:15.780]  has come up with a legal way for the American people to see what the
[03:48:15.780 --> 03:48:22.780]  Democrats are so anxious to withhold from the American public.
[03:48:22.780 --> 03:48:25.780]  The House Intelligence Committee votes to release it and it seems as though
[03:48:25.780 --> 03:48:29.780]  there will soon be tremendous pressure to do so. And if it doesn't,
[03:48:29.780 --> 03:48:34.780]  I am suggesting that one of those members of Congress that you just ran on the
[03:48:34.780 --> 03:48:38.780]  screen should take this to the floor of the House of Representatives and release
[03:48:38.780 --> 03:48:42.780]  it there because the Constitution protects anything that is said there.
[03:48:42.780 --> 03:48:46.780]  As Senator Feinstein did this with torture memos, these members of
[03:48:46.780 --> 03:48:49.780]  Congress should do it with this because the rest of Congress and the American
[03:48:49.780 --> 03:48:54.780]  public is entitled to know. We put the Constitution in the hands of people to
[03:48:54.780 --> 03:48:58.780]  protect it and they've abused that power. We need to know who the abusers were
[03:48:58.780 --> 03:49:02.780]  and what they did.
[03:49:02.780 --> 03:49:09.780]  And there you have it, a brilliant analysis by Judge Andrew Napolitano.
[03:49:09.780 --> 03:49:15.780]  I first met Judge Napolitano when I ran the campaign of New Jersey
[03:49:15.780 --> 03:49:22.780]  Governor Thomas Cain in 1981, which resulted in the closest election in
[03:49:22.780 --> 03:49:30.780]  New Jersey history, decided by 1,208 votes out of more than 2 million cast.
[03:49:30.780 --> 03:49:36.780]  And Judge Napolitano, literally a distinguished lawyer but not yet in
[03:49:36.780 --> 03:49:43.780]  public service, came to the fore as Tom Cain's attorney, one of his lead
[03:49:43.780 --> 03:49:49.780]  attorneys in that recount process. A great legal scholar, a great friend,
[03:49:49.780 --> 03:49:55.780]  and the man I believe that Donald Trump should put next on the US Supreme
[03:49:55.780 --> 03:50:03.780]  Court. And he has proposed a solution. If Congressman Gates and Congressman
[03:50:03.780 --> 03:50:09.780]  Gowdy and Congressman DeSantis and Congressman Jordan fail to get the
[03:50:09.780 --> 03:50:14.780]  Democrats or a majority of the Intelligence Committee to make this
[03:50:14.780 --> 03:50:20.780]  information public, after all, hapless Adam Schiff argues it's too
[03:50:20.780 --> 03:50:26.780]  complicated for the people to understand than one of them should surely
[03:50:26.780 --> 03:50:31.780]  read it into the public record. The American people have a right to know
[03:50:31.780 --> 03:50:38.780]  exactly what has transpired here and who has violated the Constitution
[03:50:38.780 --> 03:50:45.780]  and the law in an illegitimate effort to smear Donald Trump and his family
[03:50:45.780 --> 03:50:52.780]  and to illegitimately take down his presidency. In essence, trying to do
[03:50:52.780 --> 03:50:57.780]  what they could not do at the ballot box last November.
[03:50:57.780 --> 03:51:03.780]  You know, this would be funny, laughable if it wasn't so outrageous.
[03:51:03.780 --> 03:51:09.780]  Ronald College has announced that General James Clapper will be teaching
[03:51:09.780 --> 03:51:18.780]  a course on ethics. Yes, Clapper, the man who lied to the US Congress under
[03:51:18.780 --> 03:51:24.780]  oath, perjured himself when he said there was no metadata collection
[03:51:24.780 --> 03:51:32.780]  program by the US government. Clapper's lie was proved when the
[03:51:32.780 --> 03:51:37.780]  Edward Snowden, a whistleblower, came forward and exposed that this
[03:51:37.780 --> 03:51:44.780]  program was not only in existence, but it was robust. Why, you ask, is Mr.
[03:51:44.780 --> 03:51:50.780]  Clapper not in a federal penitentiary where he belongs? Why is there one
[03:51:50.780 --> 03:51:57.780]  rule of law for some, but not others? Let's be clear, this shaved head
[03:51:57.780 --> 03:52:03.780]  criminal belongs behind bars. He doesn't belong at the head of a classroom
[03:52:03.780 --> 03:52:10.780]  talking about ethics because he has none. James Clapper, a national
[03:52:10.780 --> 03:52:18.780]  disgrace. While we are on the subject, I must admit that the entire
[03:52:18.780 --> 03:52:26.780]  mainstream media silence over the missing text messages by FBI agents
[03:52:26.780 --> 03:52:32.780]  is somewhat shocking. You see, I'm old enough to remember the public
[03:52:32.780 --> 03:52:39.780]  furor over the missing 18 and a half minutes from the so-called Nixon
[03:52:39.780 --> 03:52:45.780]  White House tapes. There was an immediate call for the president's
[03:52:45.780 --> 03:52:50.780]  impeachment when it was revealed that 18 and a half minutes of evidence
[03:52:50.780 --> 03:52:57.780]  in the Watergate scandal had disappeared. Loyal secretary Rose Mary Woods
[03:52:57.780 --> 03:53:03.780]  took the rap for that erasure claiming that while transcribing the tape,
[03:53:03.780 --> 03:53:08.780]  she had picked up the phone inadvertently leaving her foot on a
[03:53:08.780 --> 03:53:13.780]  transcription panel that controlled the dictabelt from which she was
[03:53:13.780 --> 03:53:20.780]  transcribing, erasing what many believe was seminal evidence in the
[03:53:20.780 --> 03:53:27.780]  Watergate scandal. Where are the mainstream media mavians now?
[03:53:27.780 --> 03:53:36.780]  Jake Tapper and Wolf Blitzer and Anderson Cooper, where is their
[03:53:36.780 --> 03:53:44.780]  outrage? Where is their demand for justice? What we actually saw yesterday
[03:53:44.780 --> 03:53:52.780]  on ABC incredibly was a complete twisting in which they said that the
[03:53:52.780 --> 03:53:58.780]  president's comments on this misstated the number of missing text messages
[03:53:58.780 --> 03:54:05.780]  and the period for which they are missing. Wrong. Read the story.
[03:54:05.780 --> 03:54:10.780]  Why is it coincidental that the Twitter messages, pardon me, the text
[03:54:10.780 --> 03:54:17.780]  messages go missing at almost exactly the time that Mr. Mueller became
[03:54:17.780 --> 03:54:23.780]  the special prosecutor? Well, today, shillingly, we seem to have an
[03:54:23.780 --> 03:54:29.780]  answer. According to true pundit, let's see if we can put that up, we
[03:54:29.780 --> 03:54:35.780]  now believe that what FBI agents were talking about was a physical
[03:54:35.780 --> 03:54:41.780]  threat against the president. Yes, they were talking about the A word,
[03:54:41.780 --> 03:54:46.780]  assassination. The American people have an absolute right to know what's
[03:54:46.780 --> 03:54:53.780]  in this material. And does anyone really believe that anything is
[03:54:53.780 --> 03:55:00.780]  erased permanently, that there is no indelible record at the NSA? I, for
[03:55:00.780 --> 03:55:07.780]  one, do not believe it. Let the truth be told. Let us see what's in the
[03:55:07.780 --> 03:55:16.780]  record. Now, before we leave, I would be remiss if I did not say yet
[03:55:16.780 --> 03:55:21.780]  again that Alex Jones has mapped out a really vigorous plan for the
[03:55:21.780 --> 03:55:27.780]  expansion of our reporting here at Info Wars. Not only do you have
[03:55:27.780 --> 03:55:33.780]  David Knight who does a terrific job with the real news. I tune in first
[03:55:33.780 --> 03:55:37.780]  thing when I get up because I want to find out what's going on in the
[03:55:37.780 --> 03:55:42.780]  world. And David Knight does a phenomenal job of looking across the
[03:55:42.780 --> 03:55:48.780]  media landscape and curating the very best stories to bring us up to
[03:55:48.780 --> 03:55:54.780]  date on what's transpired overnight. Midday, of course, you have Alex
[03:55:54.780 --> 03:56:00.780]  Jones and his historic legendary Alex Jones show. Just yesterday, he
[03:56:00.780 --> 03:56:05.780]  made history by bringing our attention to a hundred page document that
[03:56:05.780 --> 03:56:11.780]  outlined the entire conspiracy in front of the FISA court. We now know
[03:56:11.780 --> 03:56:17.780]  from this document that there was an illicit attempt by the Obama
[03:56:17.780 --> 03:56:23.780]  administration to put the entire Trump campaign and Trump tower under
[03:56:23.780 --> 03:56:29.780]  surveillance. And then, of course, you have our expanded coverage here at
[03:56:29.780 --> 03:56:35.780]  the war room. Now, none of this is free. And we cannot continue this
[03:56:35.780 --> 03:56:41.780]  dynamic expansion unless you go to the Info Wars store and support what
[03:56:41.780 --> 03:56:46.780]  we are doing. If you look at the Info Wars store now, you have 25% off
[03:56:46.780 --> 03:56:53.780]  Brain Force Plus. This is still, despite my new love for Immune Wall, my
[03:56:53.780 --> 03:56:59.780]  number one favorite product. Why? Because it enhances your mental
[03:56:59.780 --> 03:57:05.780]  acuity, your mental organization, your mental energy when you're putting
[03:57:05.780 --> 03:57:13.780]  in these long days. And at 25% off, that's a terrific price. And if you
[03:57:13.780 --> 03:57:19.780]  sign up for the auto ship program, you will never be without. I made that
[03:57:19.780 --> 03:57:25.780]  mistake once. I will never make it again. You can get delivery every 30
[03:57:25.780 --> 03:57:32.780]  days, every 60 days, every 90 days at your request. The very best of the
