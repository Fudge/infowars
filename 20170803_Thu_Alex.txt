[00:00.000 --> 00:13.760]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're live, we're broadcasting worldwide today.
[00:13.760 --> 00:17.680]  Milo Yiannopoulos is going to be in studio with us for two hours.
[00:17.680 --> 00:19.640]  Roger Stone's going to join us in the fourth hour.
[00:19.640 --> 00:26.040]  I'm going to co-host that with Anthony Cummings today because we have breaking news not just
[00:26.040 --> 00:31.800]  from Roger but from my other sources of how Trump is now being isolated inside of the
[00:31.800 --> 00:37.320]  White House ahead of his removal from office.
[00:37.320 --> 00:40.480]  And that of course is a coup d'etat.
[00:40.480 --> 00:42.920]  Now I learned this information yesterday afternoon.
[00:42.920 --> 00:44.480]  I called Roger.
[00:44.480 --> 00:49.960]  He was also getting a similar intel from White House sources, including as high as you can
[00:49.960 --> 00:50.960]  pretty much get.
[00:50.960 --> 00:53.000]  I'm going to leave it at that.
[00:53.000 --> 01:00.000]  And then I saw the headline, Kelly cracks down on West Wing back channels to Trump.
[01:00.000 --> 01:02.840]  They want no one to communicate with him but them.
[01:02.840 --> 01:04.960]  It's all coming up today.
[01:04.960 --> 01:07.680]  Learn next year's news today here at Imple Wars.
[01:07.680 --> 01:10.520]  But first, Debbie Wasserman Schultz is in trouble.
[01:10.520 --> 01:14.080]  Congress is launching criminal investigations.
[01:14.080 --> 01:18.920]  Professional liar Debbie Wasserman Schultz thinks she still lives in the carefree days
[01:18.920 --> 01:21.680]  of Clinton and Obama's land of corruption.
[01:21.680 --> 01:26.960]  A magically delicious place where anything goes as long as you defend your crimes by
[01:26.960 --> 01:30.480]  debasing them as racist and Islamophobic.
[01:30.480 --> 01:32.160]  Oh, I see nothing.
[01:32.160 --> 01:33.480]  I was not here.
[01:33.480 --> 01:38.000]  I did not even get up this morning.
[01:38.000 --> 01:39.000]  What about diversity?
[01:39.000 --> 01:45.240]  It really has been a challenge that the Capitol Police has faced systemically with diversity.
[01:45.240 --> 01:48.560]  Diversity in your leadership, diversity in recruitment.
[01:48.560 --> 01:51.120]  How are you focusing in on improving that?
[01:51.120 --> 01:56.840]  And I mean, I don't mean that in disrespect, but it is hard to take your word for it.
[01:56.840 --> 02:02.680]  Investors.com reports Chris Gowen, a WAN's lawyer and a longtime associate of the Clintons
[02:02.680 --> 02:07.920]  claim that this is clearly a right wing media driven prosecution by a United States attorney's
[02:07.920 --> 02:12.400]  office that wants to prosecute people for working while Muslim.
[02:12.400 --> 02:17.760]  Schultz said the whole thing raises troubling concerns about due process, fair treatment
[02:17.760 --> 02:20.800]  and potential ethnic and religious profiling.
[02:20.800 --> 02:27.480]  Of course, crooked Schultz kept Muslim Brotherhood sympathizer, IT staffer Imran Awan on her
[02:27.480 --> 02:33.160]  staff long after all the other House Democrats had dropped Awan due to the DC police probe
[02:33.160 --> 02:34.400]  back in February.
[02:34.400 --> 02:35.400]  Why?
[02:35.400 --> 02:37.160]  Well, the plot is thickening.
[02:37.160 --> 02:43.200]  Roger Stone reports that Awan was with Seth Rich hours before his murder.
[02:43.200 --> 02:48.560]  And Pulitzer Prize winning journalist Seymour Hirsch recently revealed inside information
[02:48.560 --> 02:51.320]  tying Seth Rich to WikiLeaks.
[02:51.320 --> 02:57.520]  He offered a sample, an extensive sample, you know, I'm sure a dozen of emails and said
[02:57.520 --> 02:58.520]  I want money.
[02:58.520 --> 03:04.480]  That later, WikiLeaks did get the password, he had a drop box, a protective drop box,
[03:04.480 --> 03:05.480]  which isn't hard to do.
[03:05.480 --> 03:11.200]  He also, this is also in the FDA report, he also let people know, but he also, the word
[03:11.200 --> 03:16.800]  was passed according to the FDA report, I also shared this box with a couple of friends.
[03:16.800 --> 03:25.840]  Now, does this arrogant outburst from Wasserman Schultz become clearer when she is denied
[03:25.840 --> 03:30.000]  access to Awan's laptop by the Capitol Police Chief?
[03:30.000 --> 03:35.680]  Members' equipment is members' equipment, it is not, it is not, under my understanding
[03:35.680 --> 03:40.800]  the Capitol Police is not able to confiscate members' equipment when the member is not
[03:40.800 --> 03:41.800]  under investigation.
[03:41.800 --> 03:44.800]  It is their equipment and it's supposed to be returned.
[03:44.800 --> 03:50.480]  I think there are extenuating circumstances in this case and I think that, you know, working
[03:50.480 --> 03:59.360]  through my counsel and, you know, the necessary personnel, if that in fact is the case and
[03:59.360 --> 04:03.400]  with the permission of, through the investigation, we will return the equipment.
[04:03.400 --> 04:06.880]  But until that's accomplished, I can't return the equipment.
[04:06.880 --> 04:12.400]  I think you're violating the rules when you conduct your business that way and you expect
[04:12.400 --> 04:14.040]  that there would be consequences.
[04:14.040 --> 04:20.560]  The Awan family, who are all under investigation, had been collectively paid four million taxpayer
[04:20.560 --> 04:28.200]  dollars for part-time, no-show, IT work by House Democrats since 2009.
[04:28.200 --> 04:33.080]  Investors.com writes, Imran and Abid both had run-ins with the law, including public
[04:33.080 --> 04:36.600]  drunkenness and accusations of insurance fraud.
[04:36.600 --> 04:42.640]  Yet Democrats in the House gave them wide-ranging access to their emails and other potentially
[04:42.640 --> 04:44.280]  sensitive information.
[04:44.280 --> 04:45.280]  Why?
[04:45.280 --> 04:46.280]  It's simple.
[04:46.280 --> 04:49.960]  The Awan's have dirt, dirt and more dirt on Schultz.
[04:49.960 --> 04:55.720]  In the coming weeks, Debbie Wasserman Schultz will reveal a nasty woman's status surpassing
[04:55.720 --> 04:57.720]  her comrade Hillary Clinton.
[04:57.720 --> 04:58.720]  Well, almost.
[04:58.720 --> 05:02.120]  John Bown reported for Infowars.com.
[05:02.120 --> 05:03.120]  Hunters.
[05:03.120 --> 05:08.200]  A 44-year-old father was beat by gang of teenagers and knocked out with a skateboard after he
[05:08.200 --> 05:11.640]  asked them to stop smoking marijuana on a Dallas train.
[05:11.640 --> 05:15.160]  The group of teenagers included young men and women who punched the father and threw
[05:15.160 --> 05:19.440]  against the train's doors before arriving at the station near Deep Ellum in Dallas,
[05:19.440 --> 05:20.440]  Texas.
[05:20.440 --> 05:25.800]  In world news, 22.5% of the German population now has a migrant background.
[05:25.800 --> 05:30.360]  Migrants and their children make up an estimated 18.6 million people in Germany.
[05:30.360 --> 05:34.440]  According to the federal statistical office, which attributed the shocking statistic to
[05:34.440 --> 05:38.880]  German Chancellor Angela Merkel and her open border policies.
[05:38.880 --> 05:43.160]  In contrast, President Trump plans to overhaul immigration laws in America as part of his
[05:43.160 --> 05:46.520]  wide-ranging agenda to tighten border security.
[05:46.520 --> 05:50.880]  The president is working with two senators to draft a bill to create a skills-based immigration
[05:50.880 --> 05:55.560]  program that gives priority to Americans by cutting down on work visa abuse, among
[05:55.560 --> 05:56.560]  other things.
[05:56.560 --> 06:01.080]  For more breaking news and reports, check back at Infowars.com throughout the day.
[06:01.080 --> 06:02.560]  This is Kit Daniels reporting.
[06:02.560 --> 06:06.880]  After being sold out for months, our best-selling Super Blue Florida toothpaste is now back
[06:06.880 --> 06:08.760]  in stock at InfowarsStore.com.
[06:08.760 --> 06:11.520]  The first shipment of Super Blue sold out in one week.
[06:11.520 --> 06:13.600]  I thought it would be a six-month supply for listeners.
[06:13.600 --> 06:17.800]  And since then, people are beating down our doors, wanting to be able to resupply their
[06:17.800 --> 06:18.800]  Super Blue.
[06:18.800 --> 06:20.680]  Research across the board is clear.
[06:20.680 --> 06:22.040]  In fact, it's certified.
[06:22.040 --> 06:25.920]  When bacteria infect your gums, it can enter your bloodstream, and even contribute to blood
[06:25.920 --> 06:27.200]  clots and heart attacks.
[06:27.200 --> 06:31.640]  That's why the Last Surgeon General's report on oral health warns that your oral health
[06:31.640 --> 06:34.200]  can have a serious impact on your entire body.
[06:34.200 --> 06:37.440]  Super Blue fluoride-free toothpaste is a groundbreaking new formula that's loaded with
[06:37.440 --> 06:40.960]  good halogen iodide, so the bad halogen fluoride.
[06:40.960 --> 06:45.240]  Super Blue contains natural oils and ingredients used since biblical times to help wipe out
[06:45.240 --> 06:47.680]  bad bacteria and eliminate bad breath.
[06:47.680 --> 06:52.120]  Just some of the ingredients in Super Blue, chosen by our dental experts, include xylitol,
[06:52.120 --> 06:55.240]  peppermint oil, iodine, nano silver, and more.
[06:55.240 --> 07:00.320]  Learn more about Infowars Life Super Blue toothpaste at InfowarsLife.com and support

[07:07.520 --> 07:12.880]  a lot of money while you get high-quality products and fund the InfoWare, a 360 win.

[07:17.840 --> 07:19.440]  at InfowarsShore.com.

[07:23.280 --> 07:27.360]  AutoShip because we hold back a surplus for AutoShip customers.
[07:27.360 --> 07:32.600]  Number three, we're giving you free shipping on all orders above $50.
[07:32.600 --> 07:36.680]  Customers have been requesting this for years because it's so easy to forget to reorder
[07:36.680 --> 07:38.480]  the products that you need each month.
[07:38.480 --> 07:43.120]  Just go to InfowarsStore.com, select your favorite product or products, click on AutoShip, and

[08:03.080 --> 08:05.080]  This is a national emergency.
[08:05.080 --> 08:07.080]  Important instructions will follow.
[08:07.080 --> 08:08.080]  What do you want?
[08:08.080 --> 08:09.080]  What the fuck?
[08:09.080 --> 08:10.080]  Got to level.
[08:10.080 --> 08:11.080]  So we'll just wait here.
[08:11.080 --> 08:12.080]  Got to level.
[08:12.080 --> 08:13.080]  Got to level.
[08:13.080 --> 08:14.080]  Got to level.
[08:14.080 --> 08:15.080]  We'll deal.
[08:15.080 --> 08:16.080]  Shot fired.
[08:16.080 --> 08:24.080]  This message is transmitted at the request with the president of the United States
[08:24.080 --> 08:27.240]  of America and the Office of Homeland Security.
[08:27.240 --> 08:31.440]  In compliance with the United Nations, the president of the United States has declared
[08:31.440 --> 08:32.440]  martial law.
[08:32.440 --> 08:33.440]  Curfee is now in place.
[08:33.440 --> 08:34.440]  Return to your homes.
[08:34.440 --> 08:35.440]  Projects are on, man.
[08:35.440 --> 08:36.440]  We're going to have to work people outside of your homes.
[08:36.440 --> 08:37.440]  We will result in you being arrested on site.
[08:37.440 --> 08:38.440]  In what is asked to be filed, the party tonight of Oregon's Connecticut used as a weapon.
[08:38.440 --> 08:39.440]  We'll be deemed an enemy of the state and we'll be arrested on site.
[08:39.440 --> 08:40.440]  U.N. peacekeeping here since have severed all data, transmission and telephone communication.
[08:40.440 --> 08:41.440]  We'll be in place.
[08:41.440 --> 08:42.440]  We'll be in place.
[08:42.440 --> 08:43.440]  We'll be in place.
[08:43.440 --> 08:44.440]  We'll be in place.
[08:44.440 --> 08:45.440]  We'll be in place.
[08:45.440 --> 08:46.440]  We'll be in place.
[08:46.440 --> 08:47.440]  We'll be in place.
[08:47.440 --> 08:48.440]  We'll be in place.
[08:48.440 --> 08:49.440]  We'll be in place.
[08:49.440 --> 08:50.440]  We'll be in place.
[08:50.440 --> 08:57.440]  U.N. peacekeeping here since have severed all data, transmission and telephone communications
[08:57.440 --> 08:58.440]  for national security.
[08:58.440 --> 09:04.440]  In violation of martial law, we'll result in immediate arrests and trial for treason.
[09:04.440 --> 09:06.440]  All traitors will be shot.
[09:06.440 --> 09:11.440]  America is now engaged in civil war.
[09:11.440 --> 09:16.440]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[09:16.440 --> 09:22.440]  It's Alex Jones.
[09:22.440 --> 09:27.440]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for joining us as we broadcast worldwide already
[09:27.440 --> 09:31.440]  Thursday, the third day of August 2017.
[09:31.440 --> 09:34.440]  Milo Unopolis is launching his new book.
[09:34.440 --> 09:37.440]  It was already a number one New York Times bestseller.
[09:37.440 --> 09:43.440]  When they canceled it via political correctness a few months ago, he's suing the publisher
[09:43.440 --> 09:46.440]  and he's reissued it himself coming out today.
[09:46.440 --> 09:49.440]  Dangerous is the name of the book.
[09:49.440 --> 09:54.440]  It's available at infowarstore.com and of course many other places.
[09:54.440 --> 09:58.440]  He'll be in studio with us for two hours today.
[09:58.440 --> 10:03.440]  Then I don't normally preempt folks that are hosted the fourth hour.
[10:03.440 --> 10:05.440]  Anthony Cummings is going to be hosting the fourth hour.
[10:05.440 --> 10:09.440]  I've invited him to ride shotgun with myself and Roger Stone.
[10:09.440 --> 10:15.440]  I got some really important information from one of my Winehouse sources yesterday afternoon.
[10:15.440 --> 10:21.440]  I finally got a hold of Roger at about 11 o'clock at night, central time last night.
[10:21.440 --> 10:30.440]  He had some very important conversations yesterday, very lengthy important conversations.
[10:30.440 --> 10:34.440]  I got off the phone at about 11.30 at night.
[10:34.440 --> 10:42.440]  And I got in bed with my tablet, my laptop, my iPad where everyone would call a stupid thing.
[10:42.440 --> 10:51.440]  And I began doing some final surfing and guess what I saw pop up in the news feed.
[10:51.440 --> 11:00.440]  Establishment news they force feed you when you fire up the iPad.
[11:00.440 --> 11:08.440]  Exactly what I had just been talking to Stone about and when I had been talking to my other source at 4 o'clock in the afternoon.
[11:08.440 --> 11:13.440]  Kelly cracks down on West Wing back channels to Trump.
[11:13.440 --> 11:20.440]  Now remember when we give you these sources information, we're not making it up.
[11:20.440 --> 11:25.440]  That's why we told you Trump would announce no expansion of the war, no plan to topple Assad.
[11:25.440 --> 11:29.440]  Three days later he said those exact words back in April.
[11:29.440 --> 11:36.440]  That's why we told you that Flynn would be out and that would be McMaster.
[11:36.440 --> 11:41.440]  Just like we told you last week, four days before it broke.
[11:41.440 --> 11:49.440]  Specifically that previous would be out by the end of the week and that General Kelly was in the front running to be chief of staff.
[11:49.440 --> 11:56.440]  And the reason this matters is there's a battle for the heart and soul of the Trump White House and the Trump presidency right now.
[11:56.440 --> 12:06.440]  And by extension you the listeners and viewers who we're interfacing with are the American resistance to this.
[12:06.440 --> 12:17.440]  Now this piece of news out of Politico that broke last night is just more confirmation of what our sources were telling us.
[12:17.440 --> 12:25.440]  But again these sources are so high level you couldn't get a better source of White House information.
[12:25.440 --> 12:37.440]  Now that said, the media has gone from freaking out about those sources and giving us a lot of attention because they know we have those sources to total silence on it.
[12:37.440 --> 12:43.440]  Because they don't have the sources and the source we have.
[12:43.440 --> 12:46.440]  And they're upset about it.
[12:46.440 --> 12:58.440]  Now the information I've got is so big that I don't even know how to properly break it all down.
[12:58.440 --> 13:01.440]  I was pretty tired at 11.30 when I climbed into bed.
[13:01.440 --> 13:03.440]  I've been up since 6 a.m.
[13:03.440 --> 13:07.440]  But I couldn't go to sleep for about three hours after I had all this information.
[13:07.440 --> 13:16.440]  I got back out of bed, went down to the kitchen table, sat there in red news and wrote notes for three hours.
[13:16.440 --> 13:22.440]  Then I went to bed about 2.30 in the morning, ended up oversleeping.
[13:22.440 --> 13:25.440]  I never sleep till 9 in the morning. I slept till 9 this morning.
[13:25.440 --> 13:33.440]  And as soon as I got up I just got in the shower and I'm just still having the same conversation that I have with myself with you.
[13:33.440 --> 13:37.440]  I don't know what to do about this.
[13:37.440 --> 13:40.440]  And I'm not 100% sure what all this means.
[13:40.440 --> 13:54.440]  But in Roger's words, in his text message to me at 11 at night when he was finally ready to talk to me, or 10.30, was, this is seven days in May.
[13:54.440 --> 14:08.440]  Now that's a Burt Lancaster movie where the Pentagon, a group of generals, decided to have a soft coup against the president.
[14:08.440 --> 14:14.440]  And then I got on the phone with him and basically was told the same information that I got from my sources.
[14:14.440 --> 14:18.440]  But his source was even more high level.
[14:18.440 --> 14:22.440]  I'm just going to stop right there.
[14:22.440 --> 14:29.440]  Seven days in May 1964, Burt Lancaster, Kurt Douglas, powerful film.
[14:29.440 --> 14:31.440]  We ought to do a review of seven days in May.
[14:31.440 --> 14:37.440]  I think we've done one before five or six years ago.
[14:37.440 --> 14:44.440]  But we're not watching a movie about a military coup.
[14:44.440 --> 14:46.440]  We are in it.
[14:46.440 --> 14:48.440]  What did Rush Limbaugh say last week?
[14:48.440 --> 14:51.440]  We played the clip and pull up the headline.
[14:51.440 --> 15:01.440]  Rush Limbaugh, headline, Democrats are contacting generals to plan a coup.
[15:01.440 --> 15:02.440]  That was the headline.
[15:02.440 --> 15:08.440]  Generals are being contacted by the Democrats in deep state to plot a coup.
[15:08.440 --> 15:12.440]  That's Rush Limbaugh, 20 million listeners a day.
[15:12.440 --> 15:19.440]  The mouth of the not completely traitorous Republican Party.
[15:19.440 --> 15:24.440]  Blue blood, elitist, but still free market, not out to destroy the country.
[15:24.440 --> 15:29.440]  And then you've got the neo-Conrinos and the Democrats, they're cancer.
[15:29.440 --> 15:32.440]  You've got Sean Hannity saying that word for word.
[15:32.440 --> 15:34.440]  There's a plan to overthrow the president.
[15:34.440 --> 15:36.440]  But forget Sean Hannity and Rush Limbaugh.
[15:36.440 --> 15:38.440]  You have Al Gore.
[15:38.440 --> 15:40.440]  You have Brennan.
[15:40.440 --> 15:47.440]  You have Clapper all on TV last week, days after a top evangelical pastor
[15:47.440 --> 15:51.440]  met with the president for hours, met with senior members of Congress for hours,
[15:51.440 --> 15:56.440]  and they told him they're shopping a plan to overthrow the president
[15:56.440 --> 16:00.440]  and contacting former and current generals to help them carry it out.
[16:00.440 --> 16:02.440]  That's how you do it.
[16:02.440 --> 16:08.440]  They had the McCormick-Dickstein committee hearings back in the late 1930s
[16:08.440 --> 16:11.440]  about how Spedley Butler, Commandant of the Marine Corps,
[16:11.440 --> 16:15.440]  two-time Congressional Medal of Honor winner, was contacted by the Bushes,
[16:15.440 --> 16:20.440]  by Prescott Bush and Brown Brother Harriman in a Nazi group,
[16:20.440 --> 16:25.440]  and asked to overthrow Franklin Delano Roosevelt.
[16:25.440 --> 16:27.440]  And then they said no.
[16:27.440 --> 16:30.440]  And they had punished the plotters because they thought it would bring the country down.
[16:30.440 --> 16:34.440]  It was so dangerous and so painful and so treacherous and stretched into
[16:34.440 --> 16:38.440]  some of the most powerful families in the country, including the Kennedys.
[16:38.440 --> 16:41.440]  Yes, the Kennedys early on were on the Nazi payroll.
[16:41.440 --> 16:43.440]  That is a fact.
[16:43.440 --> 16:45.440]  They were in bed with sex operatives.
[16:45.440 --> 16:46.440]  They were getting paid off.
[16:46.440 --> 16:49.440]  But back then, Hitler was seen as good in the mid-30s.
[16:49.440 --> 16:52.440]  Joseph Kennedy and the rest of it.
[16:52.440 --> 16:53.440]  They were seen as anti-communist.
[16:53.440 --> 16:56.440]  Time magazine, you know, was saying Hitler's the greatest guy.
[16:56.440 --> 16:57.440]  The liberals loved him.
[16:57.440 --> 17:02.440]  He was for eugenics and sterilizing the minorities and a vegetarian and animal rights activist.
[17:02.440 --> 17:09.440]  I mean, he followed the whole template.
[17:09.440 --> 17:14.440]  But I digress, we're looking at a more organized operation.
[17:14.440 --> 17:18.440]  And I don't know if Kelly and Mattis are in on it.
[17:18.440 --> 17:24.440]  I don't know if they're, quote, isolating the president to, quote, protect him from a coup.
[17:24.440 --> 17:29.440]  He seems to trust him and he's got good instincts or whether they're playing a double game.
[17:29.440 --> 17:35.440]  But they are isolating him and not letting anybody get info to him.
[17:35.440 --> 17:39.440]  I'm not going to name names here.
[17:39.440 --> 17:49.440]  And they're quoted in the news like he's some mentally ill, mentally retarded, you know, cousin you keep in the attic or the basement.
[17:49.440 --> 17:58.440]  And about, yeah, he kind of goes with whatever, you know, he put out that disinfo, Politico says, quote, in the general.
[17:58.440 --> 18:00.440]  And Politico is such fake news.
[18:00.440 --> 18:03.440]  Who knows if the general even said that?
[18:03.440 --> 18:05.440]  General Kelly is chief of staff.
[18:05.440 --> 18:08.440]  You know that he was being spied on by Obama.
[18:08.440 --> 18:09.440]  He just got that.
[18:09.440 --> 18:10.440]  It was in the New York Times.
[18:10.440 --> 18:11.440]  They said they were spying on him.
[18:11.440 --> 18:14.440]  They have the intercepts now of the attorney general.
[18:14.440 --> 18:16.440]  They have the intercepts of his family.
[18:16.440 --> 18:17.440]  They were spying.
[18:17.440 --> 18:21.440]  They bragged they were spying and you've got them saying, because, you know, the president's dumb.
[18:21.440 --> 18:23.440]  He'll say any disinfo.
[18:23.440 --> 18:24.440]  He gets told.
[18:24.440 --> 18:26.440]  Somebody told him.
[18:26.440 --> 18:31.440]  And somebody gave him a Breitbart article saying he was being spied on.
[18:31.440 --> 18:33.440]  And so now he's gone off half cocked.
[18:33.440 --> 18:39.440]  Breitbart showed a screenshot like we did days after we did of the New York Times saying wiretaps picked it up.
[18:39.440 --> 18:41.440]  So see, remember all that?
[18:41.440 --> 18:42.440]  They were saying, oh, we're spying.
[18:42.440 --> 18:43.440]  Trump goes, that's illegal.
[18:43.440 --> 18:44.440]  They go, we never spied.
[18:44.440 --> 18:45.440]  You're crazy.
[18:45.440 --> 18:46.440]  It's only in hundreds of newspapers.
[18:46.440 --> 18:48.440]  And we only quoted it on CNN and Fox News.
[18:48.440 --> 18:50.440]  And we only had congressional hearings about it.
[18:50.440 --> 18:56.440]  And they're only using the intercepts now and leaking them everywhere, selectively edited.
[18:56.440 --> 19:00.440]  They're only leaking all his phone calls with world leaders right now.
[19:00.440 --> 19:03.440]  But they think you're so stupid that they're saying he's crazy.
[19:03.440 --> 19:10.440]  But don't worry, General Kelly, General Kelly will make sure none of that information gets to Trump.
[19:10.440 --> 19:26.440]  And then McMaster, the head of the national security, he will fire anybody that talks about globalism to the president on his staff that writes papers about radical Islam and globalism being allied against America,
[19:26.440 --> 19:30.440]  which it is and which Bandit is exposed, well, guess what?
[19:30.440 --> 19:35.440]  It's now come out that McMaster will fire anybody that talks about it or is an anti-globalist.
[19:35.440 --> 19:39.440]  So what do you call this?
[19:39.440 --> 19:41.440]  I call it a mess.
[19:41.440 --> 19:43.440]  But you got a bunch of different factions.
[19:43.440 --> 19:45.440]  These guys are acting just like Alexander Haig.
[19:45.440 --> 19:48.440]  Remember when Reagan got shot, Haig runs out and goes, I've got the codes.
[19:48.440 --> 19:49.440]  I'm in charge.
[19:49.440 --> 19:50.440]  I am now the president.
[19:50.440 --> 19:52.440]  I am the president.
[19:52.440 --> 19:54.440]  No, no, none of these generals ever got elected to office.
[19:54.440 --> 19:56.440]  They never did anything that Trump did.
[19:56.440 --> 19:57.440]  Trump's the maverick.
[19:57.440 --> 19:58.440]  We elected him.
[19:58.440 --> 20:27.440]  He's the president, not you.
[20:28.440 --> 20:35.440]  Are you one of the 15 million men who suffer from an enlarged prostate?
[20:35.440 --> 20:40.440]  If your life revolves around finding the closest bathroom, if you're tired of waking up many times a night to urinate,
[20:40.440 --> 20:43.440]  then you need to know about prostate miracle.
[20:43.440 --> 20:48.440]  Prostate miracle contains beta-cytyl sterol, which is 3,000 times stronger than salt-bowl metal.

[21:06.440 --> 21:11.440]  The first shipment of super blue sold out in one week. I thought it would be a six month supply for listeners.

[22:00.440 --> 22:06.440]  It's been said any society is only three missed meals away from chaos. Those times may be near.
[22:06.440 --> 22:12.440]  Think about it. Our country faces multiple terrorist threats and aggressions from Russia and North Korea.
[22:12.440 --> 22:17.440]  Social unrest and violent marches yet again may lead to looting of stores and city shutdowns.
[22:17.440 --> 22:23.440]  And a crumbling infrastructure leaves our power grid vulnerable to long-term outages from a single cyber attack.
[22:23.440 --> 22:29.440]  When the chaos from any one of these threats arises, the government knows it can't provide during a widespread national emergency.
[22:29.440 --> 22:35.440]  That's why you need your own plan for self-reliance. That's where my patriot supply comes in.

[24:22.440 --> 24:30.440]  Roger Stove is joining us with huge breaking news about the isolation of the president ahead of an attempted physical coup.
[24:30.440 --> 24:35.440]  You have Al Goreb. You have Brennan, formerly the CIA, that Trump fired.
[24:35.440 --> 24:38.440]  Shades of Kennedy firing the CIA director and getting killed a year later.
[24:38.440 --> 24:43.440]  You have him saying, don't worry about impeachment. We're about to remove him in the next few months.
[24:43.440 --> 24:46.440]  It's going to be bipartisan and we've all got to work together.
[24:46.440 --> 24:52.440]  And they're calmly on TV talking about it so everyone accepts it when it happens.
[24:52.440 --> 24:59.440]  They've got all these movies and TV shows and dramas where the president's killed and then there is a succession.
[24:59.440 --> 25:06.440]  And you've got major publications talking about what happens when the president gets killed and how COG kicks in
[25:06.440 --> 25:13.440]  and how don't worry the Democrats, the failing collapsing party with the Republican leadership that's sabotaging their own party by design.
[25:13.440 --> 25:22.440]  How they are going to come in and reorganize things and have new elections and magically the Democrats are going to win.
[25:22.440 --> 25:25.440]  They're not going to let us have the 2018 election.
[25:25.440 --> 25:31.440]  That's going to only reaffirm populist and Trumpites and Ron Paul types and info orders.
[25:31.440 --> 25:36.440]  They know that we just took control of the vast majority of state houses and governorships.
[25:36.440 --> 25:40.440]  They know we're taking control of the Supreme Court and other federal courts.
[25:40.440 --> 25:43.440]  They know we're going to get gains in Congress.
[25:43.440 --> 25:46.440]  So the headlines are Republicans turning on Trump.
[25:46.440 --> 25:47.440]  Trump's going down.
[25:47.440 --> 25:49.440]  Trump has low approval rating.
[25:49.440 --> 25:52.440]  Trump, Trump, Trump's a traitor.
[25:52.440 --> 26:00.440]  But all the patriots from Lou Dobbs to myself to Sean Hannity to Rush Limbaugh to Matt Drudge.
[26:00.440 --> 26:06.440]  Anybody that knows the facts are telling you, look, the Democrat think tanks are saying overthrow Trump.
[26:06.440 --> 26:10.440]  Now they've moved from saying at the think tanks to saying it on the news.
[26:10.440 --> 26:17.440]  And imagine if Republicans were out here saying go after Obama when he was in kill Obama overthrow Obama.
[26:17.440 --> 26:19.440]  It would have been the end of the world.
[26:19.440 --> 26:21.440]  But we knew he was unpopular.
[26:21.440 --> 26:23.440]  We knew we were going to intellectually beat them.
[26:23.440 --> 26:27.440]  We didn't want him to be hurt.
[26:27.440 --> 26:37.440]  And that's what's crazy is that they are buying into the propaganda that they can kill Trump or remove Trump and not turn him into a martyr.
[26:37.440 --> 26:41.440]  The Senate Republican leadership has always been a bunch of blue blood scum.
[26:41.440 --> 26:44.440]  They're the ones whose heads are on the chopping block.
[26:44.440 --> 26:48.440]  They're the ones who helped pass Obamacare the monumental screw job.
[26:48.440 --> 26:53.440]  And you've got flake and McMaster and others out promoting globalism.
[26:53.440 --> 26:57.440]  You've got people in the Trump administration on the inside.
[26:57.440 --> 27:05.440]  You've got senators out promoting new world order right as it quakes and shakes and prepares to collapse.
[27:05.440 --> 27:10.440]  All putting on a giant act.
[27:10.440 --> 27:19.440]  Meanwhile, a Jamie White article from infowars.com, China runs drill to censor harmful websites.
[27:19.440 --> 27:28.440]  Continuation of Chai-Com Internet censorship that our own government and media has been now adopting.
[27:28.440 --> 27:29.440]  Think about that.
[27:29.440 --> 27:37.440]  And that leads us now to this next huge, gigantic, mega massive piece of news.
[27:37.440 --> 27:40.440]  Remember these headlines out of zero hedge?
[27:40.440 --> 27:45.440]  Remember these headlines out of World Tribune, out of infowars.com in January of this year?
[27:45.440 --> 27:52.440]  As the clock ticked down, Obama created Ministry of Truth to counter fake news.
[27:52.440 --> 27:56.440]  The coming crackdown on free speech.
[27:56.440 --> 27:58.440]  Now here it is.
[27:58.440 --> 28:03.440]  Funds to counter Russia extremists gathered dust at State Department.
[28:03.440 --> 28:11.440]  $80 million that Obama signed when he was still in office when President Trump was president-elect.
[28:11.440 --> 28:19.440]  The whole bill is about Russia and RT and infowars with no proof claiming infowars is part of some Russian operation.
[28:19.440 --> 28:22.440]  And it said that it was there to counter me.
[28:22.440 --> 28:28.440]  And you've seen the members of the Federal Election Commission calling for more investigations.
[28:28.440 --> 28:34.440]  And the FBI counter espionage investigation going on against Breitbart and infowars and Drudge.
[28:34.440 --> 28:35.440]  Ridiculous.
[28:35.440 --> 28:41.440]  Totally ridiculous, but they passed $80 million a year to fund this out of the State Department.
[28:41.440 --> 28:47.440]  Now go back to Public Affairs, The Washington Post magazine, three years ago.
[28:47.440 --> 28:48.440]  The headline.
[28:48.440 --> 28:53.440]  Congress legalizes CIA engaging in domestic propaganda lying.
[28:53.440 --> 28:55.440]  Now they've got the funding.
[28:55.440 --> 28:57.440]  And here's the line.
[28:57.440 --> 29:02.440]  CNN goes, Trump's getting easy on ISIS.
[29:02.440 --> 29:06.440]  Trump's blocking funds to counter extremism, ISIS.
[29:06.440 --> 29:22.440]  The bill that Obama signed is about domestic media listing it as enemy with no proof so you can engage in operations against it using the CIA and army special forces in America, including killing people.
[29:22.440 --> 29:23.440]  That's right.
[29:23.440 --> 29:24.440]  That's right, folks.
[29:24.440 --> 29:26.440]  Under espionage, they can kill people.
[29:26.440 --> 29:29.440]  They want to kill me saying I'm a Russian agent.
[29:29.440 --> 29:32.440]  As if the military is going to follow those orders.
[29:32.440 --> 29:34.440]  Everybody knows who the real traders are.
[29:34.440 --> 29:35.440]  And here it is right here.
[29:35.440 --> 29:39.440]  It says ISIS loses on the battlefield and moves to spy attacks on Europe.
[29:39.440 --> 29:42.440]  And Trump and Tillerson aren't doing anything to stop ISIS.
[29:42.440 --> 29:47.440]  Really, it's Trump that just smashed Obama's ISIS army and Hillary's ISIS army.
[29:47.440 --> 29:48.440]  They're the founders of it.
[29:48.440 --> 29:54.440]  So now they say they won't fight ISIS using this when it's meant to kill the free press.
[29:54.440 --> 29:59.440]  That's the lies. The lies within lies within lies.
[30:24.440 --> 30:26.440]  It's available at infoworksstore.com.

[30:53.440 --> 30:55.440]  And you can't support an organization that didn't fight in order.
[30:55.440 --> 30:57.440]  Look at the response we're getting.
[30:57.440 --> 30:59.440]  Whoever changed the world together.
[30:59.440 --> 31:00.440]  You are the info war.
[31:00.440 --> 31:26.440]  Thank you.
[31:26.440 --> 31:52.440]  Thank you.
[31:52.440 --> 32:18.440]  Thank you.
[32:18.440 --> 32:29.440]  Right now we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism right now with all the refugees spreading disease around.
[32:29.440 --> 32:32.440]  We have biological warfare going on everywhere.
[32:32.440 --> 32:33.440]  These are all parasites.
[32:33.440 --> 32:34.440]  Tell us about all the stuff.
[32:34.440 --> 32:35.440]  There's so many things that are in it.
[32:35.440 --> 32:37.440]  You have the neem in there.
[32:37.440 --> 32:40.440]  You have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood.
[32:40.440 --> 32:43.440]  I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[32:43.440 --> 32:44.440]  All right.
[32:44.440 --> 32:46.440]  Well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[32:46.440 --> 32:49.440]  It just came back in yesterday. Living Defense, infowarslife.com.
[32:49.440 --> 32:50.440]  And folks, you can't lose.
[32:50.440 --> 32:52.440]  It's full of stuff that's great for your body, period.
[32:52.440 --> 32:56.440]  And you support the broadcast, infowarslife.com.
[32:56.440 --> 32:58.440]  Thank you, Dr. Group, from the Global Healing Center.
[32:58.440 --> 33:02.440]  Thank you so much for all your work, sir, on this great product.
[33:02.440 --> 33:04.440]  This is a national emergency.
[33:04.440 --> 33:06.440]  Important instructions will follow.
[33:06.440 --> 33:16.440]  What do you want?
[33:16.440 --> 33:24.440]  This message is transmitted at the request of the President of the United States of America
[33:24.440 --> 33:26.440]  and the Office of Homeland Security.
[33:26.440 --> 33:28.440]  In compliance with the United Nations,
[33:28.440 --> 33:31.440]  the President of the United States has declared martial law.
[33:31.440 --> 33:36.440]  Curfew is now in place. Return to your homes.
[33:36.440 --> 33:38.440]  If you are looking for outside of your homes,
[33:38.440 --> 33:41.440]  we will be assaulting you being arrested on site.
[33:41.440 --> 33:43.440]  In what says to me by law,
[33:43.440 --> 33:45.440]  the Guardian of the Night of Orleans,
[33:45.440 --> 33:47.440]  Connecticut, used as a weapon,
[33:47.440 --> 33:49.440]  will be deemed an enemy of the state
[33:49.440 --> 33:51.440]  and will be arrested on site.
[33:51.440 --> 33:53.440]  U.N. peacekeeping terrorists
[33:53.440 --> 33:55.440]  have severed all data transmissions
[33:55.440 --> 33:58.440]  and telephoned communications for national security.
[33:58.440 --> 34:02.440]  In violation of martial law, we will be assaulting immediate arrests
[34:02.440 --> 34:04.440]  and trial for treason.
[34:04.440 --> 34:06.440]  All traitors will be shot.
[34:06.440 --> 34:11.440]  America is now engaged in civil war.
[34:11.440 --> 34:14.440]  If you are receiving this transmission,
[34:14.440 --> 34:16.440]  you are the resistance.
[34:16.440 --> 34:19.440]  Meanwhile, Al Gore spends 30-plus percent more energy
[34:19.440 --> 34:22.440]  on one house than the average person.
[34:22.440 --> 34:26.440]  The truth about the climate crisis is still inconvenient.
[34:26.440 --> 34:28.440]  The water cycle is disrupted,
[34:28.440 --> 34:30.440]  so we get these rain bombs.
[34:30.440 --> 34:32.440]  The ice starts melting faster.
[34:32.440 --> 34:34.440]  Rain bomb is what they're calling it?
[34:34.440 --> 34:36.440]  Yeah, that's what some scientists are calling them now.
[34:36.440 --> 34:40.440]  Yeah, you can see the glaciers just literally exploding.
[34:40.440 --> 34:42.440]  Then you probably want to go to the doctor.
[34:42.440 --> 34:45.440]  And unfortunately, that's happening a lot more frequently.
[34:45.440 --> 34:47.440]  The new studies indicate we're in danger.
[34:47.440 --> 34:50.440]  It affects the spread of tropical diseases.
[34:50.440 --> 34:52.440]  Now it's going way up.
[34:52.440 --> 34:54.440]  It has really increased dramatically.
[34:54.440 --> 34:57.440]  It challenges to the governance of some countries.
[34:57.440 --> 34:59.440]  The droughts get deeper and longer.
[34:59.440 --> 35:02.440]  That really concerned me because I was worried that ice melt
[35:02.440 --> 35:05.440]  is increasing dramatically.
[35:05.440 --> 35:11.440]  And the number of people that are becoming climate refugees already
[35:11.440 --> 35:15.440]  is beginning to create some political unrest.
[35:15.440 --> 35:18.440]  All these horrible consequences that scientists are predicting.
[35:18.440 --> 35:22.440]  How did you find the moral courage to rise up and solve this?
[35:22.440 --> 35:25.440]  We need to hear this as a wake-up call.
[35:25.440 --> 35:27.440]  We need to defend ourselves.
[35:27.440 --> 35:30.440]  Also, climate refugees are beginning to create
[35:30.440 --> 35:32.440]  the instability in parts of Europe.
[35:32.440 --> 35:34.440]  And this is just the beginning.
[35:34.440 --> 35:38.440]  Tick-borne diseases, which are really exploding this year,
[35:38.440 --> 35:40.440]  even worse sea level rise,
[35:40.440 --> 35:42.440]  and even worse catastrophes,
[35:42.440 --> 35:47.440]  devastating the tremendous amount of anxiety every single day.
[35:47.440 --> 35:49.440]  Unfortunately, getting worse.
[35:49.440 --> 35:52.440]  That should be an alarm bell to the human race
[35:52.440 --> 35:55.440]  spreading these tropical diseases elsewhere.
[35:55.440 --> 35:59.440]  The relationship between humanity and microbes
[35:59.440 --> 36:01.440]  has always been mediated by climate.
[36:01.440 --> 36:05.440]  And a warmer, wetter, more chaotic climate
[36:05.440 --> 36:09.440]  favors the microbes and works against us.
[36:09.440 --> 36:11.440]  The resistance to civil rights laws
[36:11.440 --> 36:13.440]  was just as fierce, if not more so,
[36:13.440 --> 36:16.440]  than the resistance to solving the climate crisis.
[36:16.440 --> 36:19.440]  I know we get it now.
[36:19.440 --> 36:21.440]  You sometimes can find ways to convince them.
[36:21.440 --> 36:23.440]  But we're running out of time.
[36:23.440 --> 36:25.440]  We're in a race against time.
[36:25.440 --> 36:27.440]  What were you doing watching Dancing with the Stars?
[36:27.440 --> 36:30.440]  Didn't you really take this seriously?
[36:30.440 --> 36:32.440]  But what are you smoking?
[36:32.440 --> 36:35.440]  Mark Dice did a great job just editing down
[36:35.440 --> 36:37.440]  just the words of him.
[36:37.440 --> 36:39.440]  And I've said this for many years.
[36:39.440 --> 36:41.440]  They engage in open-air genetic engineering,
[36:41.440 --> 36:44.440]  pharmacological crops, human animals,
[36:44.440 --> 36:48.440]  spicing, animal, animal, plant, plant, plant, animal, spicing.
[36:48.440 --> 36:52.440]  It gives rise to superviruses, mutated bacteria.
[36:52.440 --> 36:55.440]  And then they say, oh, look, there's new diseases.
[36:55.440 --> 36:57.440]  Oh, look, Lyme's disease is spreading
[36:57.440 --> 37:01.440]  when it came from a U.S. weapons laboratory.
[37:01.440 --> 37:03.440]  That's been declassified, Plum Island.
[37:03.440 --> 37:05.440]  Oh, it's the earth heating up.
[37:05.440 --> 37:09.440]  Pay me more money for my carbon tax company in London,
[37:09.440 --> 37:11.440]  or you're all dead.
[37:11.440 --> 37:13.440]  Move out of your beachside homes.
[37:13.440 --> 37:15.440]  We're going to be underwater by 2013.
[37:15.440 --> 37:17.440]  The Antarctic and Arctic will be totally melted.
[37:17.440 --> 37:19.440]  They're actually record size.
[37:19.440 --> 37:20.440]  All lies.
[37:20.440 --> 37:22.440]  Polar bears can't swim.
[37:22.440 --> 37:30.440]  But then notice he goes on to talk about the refugees pouring in.
[37:30.440 --> 37:34.440]  When Peter Sutherland, who helped found the EU,
[37:34.440 --> 37:37.440]  became the head of the refugee program six years ago
[37:37.440 --> 37:40.440]  and began advertising for Muslims to come into Europe
[37:40.440 --> 37:42.440]  that they were going to open the borders of Turkey,
[37:42.440 --> 37:46.440]  open the borders in Italy, in Macedonia,
[37:46.440 --> 37:49.440]  in other areas to let people by ship and by foot
[37:49.440 --> 37:52.440]  and by train and by car get in
[37:52.440 --> 37:56.440]  and then give them free housing to incentivize more people coming
[37:56.440 --> 38:01.440]  and then say, oh, they're climate refugees.
[38:01.440 --> 38:04.440]  We warned you the third world was going to collapse
[38:04.440 --> 38:06.440]  because they're the same people looting the third world.
[38:06.440 --> 38:09.440]  They're the same ones then advertising in the third world.
[38:09.440 --> 38:13.440]  They say refugees, come here.
[38:13.440 --> 38:17.440]  And then they point at the refugees and say, see,
[38:17.440 --> 38:22.440]  we told you so when it's the UN using them as a weapon system
[38:22.440 --> 38:24.440]  to bring down the West.
[38:24.440 --> 38:28.440]  And then folks that Trump has brought in
[38:28.440 --> 38:30.440]  to the National Security Council
[38:30.440 --> 38:33.440]  and brought in the State Department are writing papers on this.
[38:33.440 --> 38:35.440]  For the State Department, I have it in my stack
[38:35.440 --> 38:42.440]  getting fired by McMaster for writing papers quoting globalists,
[38:42.440 --> 38:47.440]  quoting Peter Sutherland, Al Gore,
[38:47.440 --> 38:51.440]  and of course George Soros in the BBC saying,
[38:51.440 --> 38:53.440]  we're getting rid of the West, we're getting rid of Europe,
[38:53.440 --> 38:56.440]  we're getting rid of free market, we're using Muslims to do it,
[38:56.440 --> 38:59.440]  admitting the plan.
[38:59.440 --> 39:04.440]  And they don't want that being given out in the government.
[39:04.440 --> 39:08.440]  And Trump's a really smart guy when it comes to basic free market policy
[39:08.440 --> 39:10.440]  and trying to run the country.
[39:10.440 --> 39:12.440]  But folks that have talked to the president recently,
[39:12.440 --> 39:15.440]  when you talk to him, reportedly,
[39:15.440 --> 39:17.440]  those that have talked to him at length,
[39:17.440 --> 39:21.440]  I mean hour-long conversations,
[39:21.440 --> 39:23.440]  he doesn't know about a lot of this
[39:23.440 --> 39:25.440]  and they're isolating him more and more.
[39:25.440 --> 39:28.440]  The one little pinhole he gets now is Sean Hannity
[39:28.440 --> 39:30.440]  that he watches most nights.
[39:30.440 --> 39:33.440]  That's the pinhole.
[39:33.440 --> 39:36.440]  And so thank God, and that's why they're trying to fire him
[39:36.440 --> 39:39.440]  because they are trying to isolate the president
[39:39.440 --> 39:41.440]  so that he doesn't know what's going on.
[39:41.440 --> 39:45.440]  And that's why Roger Stone is going to be joining us in the fourth hour.
[39:45.440 --> 39:47.440]  He has his sources.
[39:47.440 --> 39:53.440]  I have my sources.
[39:53.440 --> 39:56.440]  Let's just say MSM doesn't have these sources.
[39:56.440 --> 39:58.440]  And here it is.
[39:58.440 --> 40:01.440]  Kelly cracks down on West Wing back channels to Trump.
[40:01.440 --> 40:04.440]  The new White House Chief of Staff is making it his first party
[40:04.440 --> 40:08.440]  to gain control over the information that gets to the president.
[40:08.440 --> 40:14.440]  And he says disinformation,
[40:14.440 --> 40:17.440]  like what the president's been saying since January,
[40:17.440 --> 40:20.440]  that Obama spied on him and his campaign.
[40:20.440 --> 40:22.440]  They were in hundreds of newspapers.
[40:22.440 --> 40:26.440]  They were in the New York Times 22 times that we found.
[40:26.440 --> 40:29.440]  Remember back in April, they were in the news saying,
[40:29.440 --> 40:31.440]  we never said we spied on him.
[40:31.440 --> 40:33.440]  We never said we had intercepts proving Russia.
[40:33.440 --> 40:34.440]  That's illegal.
[40:34.440 --> 40:35.440]  Trump's crazy.
[40:35.440 --> 40:38.440]  And we found 22 New York Times articles,
[40:38.440 --> 40:44.440]  some of them front page saying wiretaps of Trump and his campaign.
[40:44.440 --> 40:48.440]  Then we got from Sheriff Arpaio's office,
[40:48.440 --> 40:51.440]  as he was outgoing,
[40:51.440 --> 40:55.440]  the NSA intercepts with my personal business phone number
[40:55.440 --> 41:00.440]  that I never even used in my office up until five years ago.
[41:00.440 --> 41:02.440]  They even had that.
[41:02.440 --> 41:06.440]  They had the Mar-Lago number to the private bedroom of the president
[41:06.440 --> 41:10.440]  that I had that I'd never had the nerve to use.
[41:10.440 --> 41:12.440]  I'm looking at these numbers.
[41:12.440 --> 41:14.440]  That's his private number at Trump Tower.
[41:14.440 --> 41:16.440]  That's the main switchboard number at Trump Tower.
[41:16.440 --> 41:18.440]  That's his Mar-Lago number.
[41:18.440 --> 41:20.440]  That's his old cell phone they turned off.
[41:20.440 --> 41:22.440]  I'm like, and there's my old business number
[41:22.440 --> 41:25.440]  that I hardly ever used a landline I mainly used
[41:25.440 --> 41:28.440]  for doing like coast-to-coast interviews or whatever.
[41:28.440 --> 41:29.440]  I go do that at the office,
[41:29.440 --> 41:31.440]  paste my kids' woke-up middle of the night.
[41:31.440 --> 41:32.440]  And yeah, there it is.
[41:32.440 --> 41:34.440]  January 20th, Inauguration Day.
[41:34.440 --> 41:38.440]  Wiretap data using inquiry of Trump aides.
[41:38.440 --> 41:39.440]  And he said, hey, never.
[41:39.440 --> 41:45.440]  But here's Kelly being quoted in Politico,
[41:45.440 --> 41:50.440]  saying that, well, we've got to stop this info,
[41:50.440 --> 41:54.440]  get the president, because he just goes with whatever he sees
[41:54.440 --> 41:57.440]  like the data about him being wiretapped.
[41:57.440 --> 41:59.440]  You mean like he read in The New York Times
[41:59.440 --> 42:01.440]  or Obama saying, we're giving all our data
[42:01.440 --> 42:05.440]  and all our wiretap data over to make sure Trump can't hide it.
[42:05.440 --> 42:07.440]  We're giving it to good people inside good agencies.
[42:07.440 --> 42:09.440]  That means the deep state.
[42:09.440 --> 42:10.440]  Remember all that?
[42:10.440 --> 42:14.440]  But they talk to you like you are a idiot
[42:14.440 --> 42:24.440]  with the IQ of a watermelon or an onion or a zucchini.
[42:24.440 --> 42:27.440]  It's so incredible.
[42:27.440 --> 42:30.440]  And I want to think, you know, General Kelly's a good guy.
[42:30.440 --> 42:32.440]  He did a great job at Homeland Security.
[42:32.440 --> 42:35.440]  69% decreasing illegals coming across.
[42:35.440 --> 42:36.440]  They're building the border wall.
[42:36.440 --> 42:37.440]  They're securing.
[42:37.440 --> 42:41.440]  Trump trusting that he's got a good career in the military
[42:41.440 --> 42:42.440]  at the Marine Corps.
[42:42.440 --> 42:44.440]  We don't know enough about him.
[42:44.440 --> 42:45.440]  But I'll tell you this.
[42:45.440 --> 42:50.440]  Mattis, mad dog Mattis, you know, as he's got,
[42:50.440 --> 42:52.440]  I don't know why I got that nickname.
[42:52.440 --> 42:54.440]  He's pretty much the opposite of that.
[42:54.440 --> 42:56.440]  You know, the so-called intellectual historical Marine
[42:56.440 --> 42:58.440]  Corps general.
[42:58.440 --> 42:59.440]  Okay.
[42:59.440 --> 43:00.440]  He slaughtered a bunch of jihadis.
[43:00.440 --> 43:04.440]  He deserved it in some battles in Iraq.
[43:04.440 --> 43:05.440]  Okay.
[43:05.440 --> 43:06.440]  Great.
[43:06.440 --> 43:07.440]  Same thing with McMaster.
[43:07.440 --> 43:08.440]  Okay.
[43:08.440 --> 43:10.440]  Back in the first Gulf War before that, whatever,
[43:10.440 --> 43:11.440]  he was a tank commander.
[43:11.440 --> 43:12.440]  Okay.
[43:12.440 --> 43:13.440]  Great.
[43:13.440 --> 43:17.440]  McMaster is purging people that are patriots.
[43:17.440 --> 43:20.440]  And McMaster has been saying, we're going to take out a sob
[43:20.440 --> 43:24.440]  and the president says he's not.
[43:24.440 --> 43:33.440]  So all I know is they're isolating the president.
[43:33.440 --> 43:38.440]  And they're working with the media to try to get rid of
[43:38.440 --> 43:42.440]  Trump's long-term security head, the former New York City
[43:42.440 --> 43:45.440]  police detective, and other people that are family
[43:45.440 --> 43:47.440]  confidants that Trump supports.
[43:47.440 --> 43:52.440]  And they've taken his cell phone away like he's a baby.
[43:52.440 --> 43:54.440]  And the media sits there and says, you know, take away his
[43:54.440 --> 43:55.440]  Twitter.
[43:55.440 --> 43:56.440]  He's the president.
[43:56.440 --> 43:58.440]  He's a media president.
[43:58.440 --> 44:00.440]  He defeated the odds of the American people and got elected.
[44:00.440 --> 44:04.440]  And I'm sick of hearing that mad dog Mattis is the man of,
[44:04.440 --> 44:08.440]  you know, the world and that General Kelly is and that they
[44:08.440 --> 44:11.440]  know best and that they're the co-presidents.
[44:11.440 --> 44:13.440]  And here's the big news.
[44:13.440 --> 44:15.440]  More is coming up.
[44:15.440 --> 44:21.440]  Little birdies told me that Mattis and Kelly have a rule that
[44:21.440 --> 44:25.440]  not one of them can be out of town when the other one is.
[44:25.440 --> 44:28.440]  They have to always have somebody there to babysit the
[44:28.440 --> 44:29.440]  president.
[44:29.440 --> 44:33.440]  So somebody's got to stay there 24 hours a day making sure
[44:33.440 --> 44:38.440]  that the president doesn't make any military decisions alone
[44:38.440 --> 44:41.440]  as if he is alone, as if there isn't a bunker full of
[44:41.440 --> 44:45.440]  military underneath the White House or a bunch of trucks
[44:45.440 --> 44:47.440]  following him around everywhere he goes in aircraft with
[44:47.440 --> 44:49.440]  mobile command centers.
[44:49.440 --> 44:53.440]  But it's the fact that they're telling the press that behind
[44:53.440 --> 44:56.440]  the scenes and telling Congress that, oh, don't worry,
[44:56.440 --> 44:57.440]  we're in control.
[44:57.440 --> 45:01.440]  The president is arrogant and it's belligerent and it's
[45:01.440 --> 45:02.440]  treasonous.
[45:02.440 --> 45:06.440]  Now, I'm not saying they are involved in treason.
[45:06.440 --> 45:11.440]  I'm saying that type of talk and that type of behavior is what
[45:11.440 --> 45:15.440]  we get out of Al Franken, you know, the failed comedian.
[45:15.440 --> 45:19.440]  And Pelosi, you can hardly walk now and is stumbling around
[45:19.440 --> 45:22.440]  dizzy and thinks that George W. Bush is still in office.
[45:22.440 --> 45:27.440]  Clearly has dementia and all these other weirdos.
[45:27.440 --> 45:31.440]  And then you got a guy who works 18 hours a day, got great
[45:31.440 --> 45:32.440]  instincts.
[45:32.440 --> 45:35.440]  Sorry, $4 trillion now on the stock market.
[45:35.440 --> 45:38.440]  Up, you know, 20-something percent.
[45:38.440 --> 45:41.440]  Hundreds of billions of new jobs coming back in, securing
[45:41.440 --> 45:44.440]  our borders, getting the V8 line back out.
[45:44.440 --> 45:46.440]  And they're sitting there acting like this incredibly
[45:46.440 --> 45:49.440]  accomplished person, the number one TV host ever.
[45:49.440 --> 45:53.440]  Highest ratings, highest grossing, super successful hotels,
[45:53.440 --> 45:56.440]  super successful golf courses, all of this.
[45:56.440 --> 45:58.440]  And they've got articles in National Review called the
[45:58.440 --> 46:04.440]  Debt of a Salesman because he didn't get rid of Obamacare in
[46:04.440 --> 46:05.440]  the first six months.
[46:05.440 --> 46:08.440]  It's his fault and he's a failure and he never did anything
[46:08.440 --> 46:09.440]  in his life.
[46:09.440 --> 46:16.440]  This from some hack writer we've never heard of.
[46:16.440 --> 46:20.440]  Mattis and Kelly came up through the U.S. Marine Corps.
[46:20.440 --> 46:24.440]  They came up through something set up by John Paul Jones
[46:24.440 --> 46:28.440]  250-something years ago.
[46:28.440 --> 46:31.440]  Doesn't mean they're not accomplished men, but they came
[46:31.440 --> 46:32.440]  through a system.
[46:32.440 --> 46:34.440]  Donald Trump didn't come through a system.
[46:34.440 --> 46:38.440]  He came through on his own will.
[46:38.440 --> 46:40.440]  He's ultra accomplished.
[46:40.440 --> 46:43.440]  And I'm sick of people saying he's not accomplished in
[46:43.440 --> 46:45.440]  playing these games.
[46:45.440 --> 46:48.440]  All these foreigners they bring into lectures like John
[46:48.440 --> 46:57.440]  Oliver, let me tell you, Trump will never be president.
[46:57.440 --> 47:02.440]  Playing these junior high mind games with everybody.
[47:02.440 --> 47:13.440]  And again, they're all over the news saying that President
[47:13.440 --> 47:17.440]  Trump will be soon removed from office and it's totally normal
[47:17.440 --> 47:18.440]  and no big deal.
[47:18.440 --> 47:20.440]  He'll just be cued out.
[47:20.440 --> 47:21.440]  He'll be liquidated.
[47:21.440 --> 47:23.440]  He'll be neutralized.
[47:23.440 --> 47:26.440]  Those are words for kill.
[47:26.440 --> 47:29.440]  And then our congressional sources have confirmed yes.
[47:29.440 --> 47:31.440]  They plan to kill him.
[47:31.440 --> 47:33.440]  They plan to murder the president.
[47:33.440 --> 47:35.440]  Is it going to be a lone nut?
[47:35.440 --> 47:39.440]  Is it going to be some right winger they wind up?
[47:39.440 --> 47:42.440]  They're plotting it right now and now they're cutting him
[47:42.440 --> 47:46.440]  off from information, cutting him off so that they can try
[47:46.440 --> 47:49.440]  to deal the death blow.
[47:49.440 --> 47:54.440]  Now our Mattis and Kelly in on it.
[47:54.440 --> 47:56.440]  I don't know.
[47:56.440 --> 47:57.440]  But I know this.
[47:57.440 --> 48:00.440]  They need to come out and say Politico quoted us wrong.
[48:00.440 --> 48:03.440]  We're not saying the president believes whatever he last read.
[48:03.440 --> 48:05.440]  We're not going to that Democratic Party deep state
[48:05.440 --> 48:06.440]  talking point.
[48:06.440 --> 48:08.440]  We know the president's correct.
[48:08.440 --> 48:10.440]  There was illegal spying on him.
[48:10.440 --> 48:13.440]  I mean, they're in the news admitting that the CIA has
[48:13.440 --> 48:16.440]  computer programs watching and listening to you in live time
[48:16.440 --> 48:19.440]  illegally and that private corporations are doing it.
[48:19.440 --> 48:24.440]  I know I told you that 20 years ago, but now it's mainstream news.
[48:24.440 --> 48:32.440]  Congress is trying to pass laws to finally restrict it.
[48:32.440 --> 48:36.440]  And now we told you about this in January.
[48:36.440 --> 48:38.440]  Now it's in mainstream news.
[48:38.440 --> 48:41.440]  They plan to use continue government to overthrow the president.
[48:41.440 --> 48:42.440]  What are you going to do about?
[48:42.440 --> 48:45.440]  I'm going to keep hammering and hammering and hammering.
[48:45.440 --> 48:51.440]  And the disinfo is so bad that CNN has a headline that Trump won't
[48:51.440 --> 48:54.440]  use 80 million that was given to him by this Congress.
[48:54.440 --> 49:00.440]  They don't say pass by Obama in his last weeks in office to fight
[49:00.440 --> 49:03.440]  ISIS propaganda.
[49:03.440 --> 49:06.440]  Trump just defeated with our military ISIS that Obama and the
[49:06.440 --> 49:11.440]  globalists created and propped up and turned loose on Christians.
[49:11.440 --> 49:15.440]  The money is to counter domestic media that's pro Trump.
[49:15.440 --> 49:22.440]  They list Breitbart and info wars in the legislation.
[49:22.440 --> 49:25.440]  The headline should be Trump's not using the money Obama set aside
[49:25.440 --> 49:27.440]  to destroy the free press.
[49:27.440 --> 49:29.440]  Instead, they turn it around and say, oh, he's not battling ISIS
[49:29.440 --> 49:32.440]  with the money when he's the one crushing it.
[49:32.440 --> 49:34.440]  See how they invert everything.
[49:34.440 --> 49:36.440]  They are a pack of lying scum.
[49:36.440 --> 49:39.440]  Total traders aligned with radical Islam.
[49:39.440 --> 49:41.440]  Period.
[49:41.440 --> 49:43.440]  And it's coming out and people understand that globalism and the
[49:43.440 --> 49:46.440]  EU and the Vatican are allied with radical Islam to literally take
[49:46.440 --> 49:49.440]  over because there's a billion and a half Muslims in 20 years.
[49:49.440 --> 49:51.440]  There's going to be three billion.
[49:51.440 --> 49:53.440]  They're the folks having an average of six kids and they decided
[49:53.440 --> 49:55.440]  to take over with the Muslims.
[49:55.440 --> 49:57.440]  It's a fact.
[49:57.440 --> 49:59.440]  I was never anti Islam.
[49:59.440 --> 50:01.440]  I was never wanting to war with these people because I wanted to
[50:01.440 --> 50:03.440]  contain it in their own hellhole.
[50:03.440 --> 50:05.440]  Skip this network break please.
[50:05.440 --> 50:08.440]  I never wanted to do that.
[50:08.440 --> 50:10.440]  But now it's out of control.
[50:10.440 --> 50:14.440]  It's uncontained and it will destroy and murder and annihilate
[50:14.440 --> 50:18.440]  everything that is open and free and I stand against it.
[50:18.440 --> 50:21.440]  It is the unholy alliance of globalism with radical Islam
[50:21.440 --> 50:24.440]  and they're all desperate to keep that from coming out because
[50:24.440 --> 50:27.440]  when the world learns that the Republican and Democratic
[50:27.440 --> 50:31.440]  leadership are wedded to orthodox radical Islam and Hillary
[50:31.440 --> 50:35.440]  and Obama were the founders of ISIS, it's game over.
[50:35.440 --> 50:39.440]  And General Flynn knew that and that's why Mattis and others
[50:39.440 --> 50:41.440]  wanted him removed.
[50:41.440 --> 50:45.440]  That Brennan is a sworn Wahhabist.
[50:45.440 --> 50:52.440]  And I'm telling you Mattis and McMaster and Kelly, all of them
[50:52.440 --> 50:56.440]  are moving into that area where we know Brennan and Mueller are
[50:56.440 --> 50:59.440]  where they're both took off radical Islam off the list.
[50:59.440 --> 51:01.440]  Won't let anybody track it or stop it.
[51:01.440 --> 51:04.440]  Let them bring in people that are known al-Qaeda.
[51:04.440 --> 51:07.440]  And you look at this nest of people in there.
[51:07.440 --> 51:10.440]  Imagine how pissed they are having to follow Trump's orders
[51:10.440 --> 51:13.440]  to annihilate ISIS and al-Qaeda.
[51:13.440 --> 51:15.440]  That's the facts.
[51:15.440 --> 51:19.440]  What you see is General Flynn's plan, even though he's gone,
[51:19.440 --> 51:21.440]  Trump's following through with it.
[51:21.440 --> 51:24.440]  That's the only reason the radical jihad forces that criminals
[51:24.440 --> 51:28.440]  and our government allied with and empowered is being smashed.
[51:28.440 --> 51:33.440]  That's the only reason.
[51:33.440 --> 51:36.440]  We better hear from McMaster and we better hear from all these
[51:36.440 --> 51:39.440]  other guys that think they're the president.
[51:39.440 --> 51:42.440]  That globalism is an enemy of America, that Islam is an enemy
[51:42.440 --> 51:45.440]  of freedom and that they're not going along with it.
[51:45.440 --> 51:53.440]  Or we got to start beating the drum to expose these people.
[51:53.440 --> 51:57.440]  And by the way, these guys are in charge of all the death squads
[51:57.440 --> 51:59.440]  and all the hit teams, but here's the good news.
[51:59.440 --> 52:02.440]  They know they're under surveillance too.
[52:02.440 --> 52:05.440]  And they know anything happens to Trump, anything happens to me,
[52:05.440 --> 52:07.440]  anything happens.
[52:07.440 --> 52:11.440]  They are the suspects, number one.
[52:11.440 --> 52:17.440]  And I've been watching them real close.
[52:17.440 --> 52:22.440]  I've been watching them real, real, real, real, real close.
[52:22.440 --> 52:25.440]  And I want them to know.
[52:25.440 --> 52:30.440]  I know Brennan and I know Mueller are on the Wahhabist payroll.
[52:30.440 --> 52:36.440]  I know McMasters is in there trying to promote globalism.
[52:36.440 --> 52:43.440]  And I know that the others are isolating the president right now.
[52:43.440 --> 52:45.440]  And that's not a good thing.
[52:45.440 --> 52:50.440]  And when they list what they're isolating him on,
[52:50.440 --> 52:55.440]  it's from any outside info like he's being spied on by the Democrats.
[52:55.440 --> 52:58.440]  Which is of course what they're afraid of because it's illegal what they did
[52:58.440 --> 53:03.440]  and he can go after them for their illegal use of the FISA court anytime they want
[53:03.440 --> 53:07.440]  because they didn't get the FISA authorization and in some cases they did
[53:07.440 --> 53:14.440]  and then they use it illegally, he has them.
[53:14.440 --> 53:17.440]  And they're maneuvering him for destruction.
[53:17.440 --> 53:21.440]  I don't know if McMasters is pure evil.
[53:21.440 --> 53:23.440]  I don't know if Mattis is pure evil.
[53:23.440 --> 53:30.440]  I don't know if all these people are 100% bad
[53:30.440 --> 53:33.440]  or they're playing some triple quadruple game against the globalist
[53:33.440 --> 53:36.440]  and Trump knows what he's doing.
[53:36.440 --> 53:41.440]  But I see them in the news going along with propaganda against the president
[53:41.440 --> 53:45.440]  and you know you guys swore an oath to protect and defend the Constitution
[53:45.440 --> 53:50.440]  and to protect and defend the president and his duly sworn duties
[53:50.440 --> 53:53.440]  and his orders and to execute him.
[53:53.440 --> 53:58.440]  And he's bringing America back, carrying the country on his shoulders
[53:58.440 --> 54:03.440]  and the least you can do is go out there and defend the president
[54:03.440 --> 54:07.440]  and stop talking out of both sides of your mouths.
[54:07.440 --> 54:11.440]  This is a lot bigger than you guys retiring with some Saudi deal
[54:11.440 --> 54:14.440]  or some five million dollar a year defense contract
[54:14.440 --> 54:19.440]  so you can go play golf and live in your big fancy house with your stupid trophy wife.
[54:19.440 --> 54:23.440]  The globalists want to kill the country and are you really going to ally
[54:23.440 --> 54:26.440]  with a billion and a half Muslims and really sell us out to them
[54:26.440 --> 54:30.440]  because that's what's going on and do you think you're ever going to get away with that?
[54:30.440 --> 54:33.440]  You think Trump is your problem?
[54:33.440 --> 54:37.440]  Trump's only one wave in this, one manifestation of the awakening.
[54:37.440 --> 54:41.440]  You're never putting the genie back in the bottle.
[54:41.440 --> 54:44.440]  You must join with us.
[54:44.440 --> 54:46.440]  You must join with the Republic.
[54:46.440 --> 54:48.440]  You must join with prosperity.
[54:48.440 --> 54:50.440]  You must join with Christianity.
[54:50.440 --> 54:52.440]  You must join with common sense.
[54:52.440 --> 54:54.440]  You must join with the Renaissance.
[54:54.440 --> 55:03.440]  You must join with your ancestors and be honorable.
[55:03.440 --> 55:07.440]  The old unwritten tradition in the US military is to not put people in charge of things
[55:07.440 --> 55:13.440]  that haven't shown their brass and who also come from bad families.
[55:13.440 --> 55:15.440]  In general, you had to come from good families
[55:15.440 --> 55:18.440]  because you got to trust the genetic type of a person.
[55:18.440 --> 55:23.440]  You guys are turning your back on your families, on your bloodline,
[55:23.440 --> 55:27.440]  on everything you are in this New World Order believing you're in this big,
[55:27.440 --> 55:31.440]  multi-dimensional, complex system of joining with Islam
[55:31.440 --> 55:34.440]  and the grand chess board to project power into the future
[55:34.440 --> 55:39.440]  and to control Islam as your magic key to control Russia and China.
[55:39.440 --> 55:41.440]  And all it's going to do is bring us down.
[55:41.440 --> 55:45.440]  It wants to destroy the West. It wants to bring it down.
[55:45.440 --> 55:47.440]  It wants to enslave everything.
[55:47.440 --> 55:51.440]  You do not join with Islam. You do not join with cancer.
[55:51.440 --> 55:59.440]  It eats your guts out and then it kills you.
[55:59.440 --> 56:03.440]  Now, here's the facts.
[56:03.440 --> 56:06.440]  We have the globalists trying to shut us down every front.
[56:06.440 --> 56:09.440]  But despite that, you have increased your funding
[56:09.440 --> 56:11.440]  and support of our operations and your prayers
[56:11.440 --> 56:14.440]  and you're spreading the links and articles on every platform you can.
[56:14.440 --> 56:18.440]  Nothing can stop you. You are our social media team listeners.
[56:18.440 --> 56:21.440]  We need you to take action and we need your financial support.
[56:21.440 --> 56:24.440]  We've ended the big free shipping specials.
[56:24.440 --> 56:26.440]  A lot of those products were about to sell out,
[56:26.440 --> 56:29.440]  so we've ended those specials as I said we would today.
[56:29.440 --> 56:35.440]  But we're launching in the month of August the 1776 Defend America specials.
[56:35.440 --> 56:42.440]  Brain force, normally $35 is 55% off 1776.

[57:22.440 --> 57:26.440]  Big huge concentrated bottle with colloidal silver and more.
[57:26.440 --> 57:30.440]  It's 11% off at 1776.

[58:04.440 --> 58:11.440]  And we have ended the specials that we had.
[58:11.440 --> 58:15.440]  These are the new specials, the 1776 specials.
[58:15.440 --> 58:19.440]  And I see on there it says free shipping.
[58:19.440 --> 58:22.440]  Here's the problem, I have these ad meetings and then half the time they get them wrong.
[58:22.440 --> 58:24.440]  And that's okay because we have a few crew here.
[58:24.440 --> 58:26.440]  That's okay because that's your game.
[58:26.440 --> 58:28.440]  It says free shipping, I guess they continue.
[58:28.440 --> 58:29.440]  Free shipping and I didn't know about it.
[58:29.440 --> 58:30.440]  We'll see how long that goes.
[58:30.440 --> 58:31.440]  I've got it in that.
[58:31.440 --> 58:34.440]  So I'm going to say as part of the 1776 special that runs for the month,
[58:34.440 --> 58:37.440]  the free shipping only is going to go until next Monday.
[58:37.440 --> 58:39.440]  Okay, so I guess free shipping continues.
[58:39.440 --> 58:44.440]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen, with the second hour with Milo,
[58:44.440 --> 58:51.440]  Inapples in studio.
[58:51.440 --> 58:57.440]  As most of you already know, I am a voracious consumer of news and information.
[58:57.440 --> 59:00.440]  And in the last four or five years doing more and more research,
[59:00.440 --> 59:05.440]  I came across the fact that the elite establishment is fully aware of the fact
[59:05.440 --> 59:10.440]  that our ancient ancestors in many cases had much better nutrition than we do today.
[59:10.440 --> 59:15.440]  And our ancient ancestors sought out the bones of the animals that they were hunting,
[59:15.440 --> 59:17.440]  killing, and then processing.
[59:17.440 --> 59:22.440]  And so I set out to develop caveman, but to not just have concentrated bone broth
[59:22.440 --> 59:27.440]  from chicken, but seven other superfood ingredients known for cleansing
[59:27.440 --> 59:30.440]  and supercharging the body at the same time.
[59:30.440 --> 59:33.440]  Info wars isn't just fighting the globalist.
[59:33.440 --> 59:38.440]  We're getting results and we're expanding in the face of the complete media assault
[59:38.440 --> 59:41.440]  and winning because of your support.
[59:41.440 --> 59:44.440]  Caveman is finally back at the info war store.
[59:44.440 --> 59:49.440]  You can get 25% off the regular price for a limited time only at infowarslife.com
[59:49.440 --> 1:00:18.440]  or by calling toll free triple A 253 3139.
[1:00:19.440 --> 1:00:35.440]  So President Trump's breaking down some of the new acts he's involved in.
[1:00:35.440 --> 1:00:41.440]  And we also have the transcripts being leaked where we've got the president talking to the Mexican president
[1:00:41.440 --> 1:00:44.440]  saying, look, we're not going to have NAFTA and GATT and all this.
[1:00:44.440 --> 1:00:47.440]  You know, you're going to pay for the wall and we're propping up your country.
[1:00:47.440 --> 1:00:49.440]  You get hundreds of billions of dollars from us.
[1:00:49.440 --> 1:00:50.440]  You're going to do this.
[1:00:50.440 --> 1:00:52.440]  You've got a southern wall.
[1:00:52.440 --> 1:00:55.440]  Quit acting like, you know, what we're trying to do is wrong.
[1:00:55.440 --> 1:00:56.440]  You control your border.
[1:00:56.440 --> 1:00:59.440]  I mean, the transcripts are powerful.
[1:00:59.440 --> 1:01:02.440]  And this is how they think they're hurting Trump.
[1:01:02.440 --> 1:01:05.440]  Washington Post obtains full transcripts of president's confidential talks
[1:01:05.440 --> 1:01:11.440]  with Mexico and Australia developing.
[1:01:11.440 --> 1:01:14.440]  And now six months in, Trump's about to have his first working vacation.
[1:01:14.440 --> 1:01:17.440]  They're saying, oh, he's lazy.
[1:01:17.440 --> 1:01:18.440]  He said he'd never play golf.
[1:01:18.440 --> 1:01:21.440]  He said he wouldn't play golf during crises.
[1:01:21.440 --> 1:01:25.440]  And he also said that he wouldn't take as many vacations, which he hasn't.
[1:01:25.440 --> 1:01:28.440]  Then they point out that, oh, his vacations cost more because of security.
[1:01:28.440 --> 1:01:31.440]  That's the Democrats ever were saying killing.
[1:01:31.440 --> 1:01:34.440]  Are you going to take the millions of dollars it costs for him to travel
[1:01:34.440 --> 1:01:36.440]  versus the four trillion in the stock market?
[1:01:36.440 --> 1:01:39.440]  Now it's 400 plus billion in new jobs.
[1:01:39.440 --> 1:01:43.440]  And in the economy coming back, right as they try to throw a wet blanket on it.
[1:01:43.440 --> 1:01:45.440]  Simply incredible.
[1:01:45.440 --> 1:01:49.440]  Milo Yiannopoulos is going to be with us for two hours in studio coming up.
[1:01:49.440 --> 1:01:54.440]  Ladies and gentlemen to talk about censorship, how his book was banned in America.
[1:01:54.440 --> 1:01:55.440]  And so much more.
[1:01:55.440 --> 1:02:02.440]  But first, here is President Trump in several clips talking about some of the new legislation,
[1:02:02.440 --> 1:02:06.440]  some of the new acts, some of the new things he's actually doing.
[1:02:06.440 --> 1:02:09.440]  That's what the media keeps pitching the fact that he hasn't gotten anything done.
[1:02:09.440 --> 1:02:14.440]  When he's gotten more done than any president I've ever seen in the first two or three years.
[1:02:14.440 --> 1:02:18.440]  I mean, he's got the economy back to where Reagan had it.
[1:02:18.440 --> 1:02:20.440]  It took Reagan four years.
[1:02:20.440 --> 1:02:23.440]  But again, they've got to invert reality.
[1:02:23.440 --> 1:02:27.440]  They passed legislation to start shutting down free media in America.
[1:02:27.440 --> 1:02:29.440]  They went for infowars and Breitbart by name.
[1:02:29.440 --> 1:02:34.440]  They turned around and say, Trump's not using the money to shut down ISIS when he's destroying ISIS.
[1:02:34.440 --> 1:02:36.440]  And the money's meant to shut down the press.
[1:02:36.440 --> 1:02:37.440]  That's how they deceive.
[1:02:37.440 --> 1:02:39.440]  Here's a few clips of the president.
[1:03:07.440 --> 1:03:13.440]  According to the way the United States issues green cards to nationals from other countries,
[1:03:13.440 --> 1:03:20.440]  green cards provide permanent residency, work authorization, and fast track to citizenship.
[1:03:20.440 --> 1:03:27.440]  For decades, the United States was operated and has operated a very low-skilled immigration system,
[1:03:27.440 --> 1:03:33.440]  issuing record numbers of green cards to low-wage immigrants.
[1:03:33.440 --> 1:03:38.440]  This policy has placed substantial pressure on American workers, taxpayers, and community resources.
[1:03:38.440 --> 1:03:44.440]  Among those hit the hardest in recent years have been immigrants and, very importantly,
[1:03:44.440 --> 1:03:49.440]  minority workers competing for jobs against brand new arrivals.
[1:03:49.440 --> 1:03:55.440]  And it has not been fair to our people, to our citizens, to our workers.
[1:03:55.440 --> 1:04:05.440]  The RAIS Act ends chain migration and replaces our low-skilled system with a new points-based system for receiving a green card.
[1:04:05.440 --> 1:04:12.440]  This competitive application process will favor applicants who can speak English,
[1:04:12.440 --> 1:04:21.440]  financially support themselves and their families, and demonstrate skills that will contribute to our economy.
[1:04:21.440 --> 1:04:30.440]  The RAIS Act prevents new migrants and new immigrants from collecting welfare and protects U.S. workers from being displaced.
[1:04:30.440 --> 1:04:35.440]  And that's a very big thing. They're not going to come in and just immediately go and collect welfare.
[1:04:35.440 --> 1:04:39.440]  That doesn't happen under the RAIS Act. They can't do that.
[1:04:39.440 --> 1:04:48.440]  Crucially, the green card reforms and the RAIS Act will give American workers a pay raise by reducing unskilled immigration.
[1:04:48.440 --> 1:04:53.440]  This legislation will not only restore our competitive edge in the 21st century,
[1:04:53.440 --> 1:04:58.440]  but it will restore the sacred bonds of trust between America and its citizens.
[1:04:58.440 --> 1:05:02.440]  This legislation demonstrates our compassion for struggling Americans.
[1:05:02.440 --> 1:05:10.440]  A 44-year-old father was beat by gang of teenagers and knocked out with a skateboard after he asked them to stop smoking marijuana on a Dallas train.
[1:05:10.440 --> 1:05:18.440]  The group of teenagers included young men and women who punched the father and threw it against the train's doors before arriving at the station near Deep Ellum in Dallas, Texas.
[1:05:18.440 --> 1:05:24.440]  In World News, 22.5% of the German population now has a migrant background.
[1:05:24.440 --> 1:05:29.440]  Migrants and their children make up an estimated 18.6 million people in Germany.
[1:05:29.440 --> 1:05:37.440]  According to the Federal Statistical Office, which attributed the shocking statistic to German Chancellor Angela Merkel and her open border policies.
[1:05:37.440 --> 1:05:45.440]  In contrast, President Trump plans to overhaul immigration laws in America as part of his wide-ranging agenda to tighten border security.
[1:05:45.440 --> 1:05:55.440]  The president is working with two senators to draft a bill to create a skills-based immigration program that gets priority to Americans by cutting down on work visa abuse, among other things.
[1:05:55.440 --> 1:06:09.440]  For more breaking news and reports, check back at infowars.com throughout the day. This is Kid Daniels reporting.
[1:06:26.440 --> 1:06:39.440]  And so I set out to develop Caveman, but to not just have concentrated bone broth from chicken, but seven other superfood ingredients known for cleansing and supercharging the body at the same time.
[1:06:39.440 --> 1:06:49.440]  Info Wars isn't just fighting the globalist. We're getting results and we're expanding in the face of the complete media assault and winning because of your support.
[1:06:49.440 --> 1:07:01.440]  Caveman is finally back at the Info Wars store. You can get 25% off the regular price for a limited time only at infowarslife.com or by calling toll-free AAA 253 3139.
[1:07:01.440 --> 1:07:10.440]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide while also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[1:07:10.440 --> 1:07:19.440]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[1:07:19.440 --> 1:07:31.440]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend. Discover and try a bag of the Patriot blend 100% organic coffee at infowarslife.com.
[1:07:31.440 --> 1:07:45.440]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally. Hands down, this is my favorite coffee and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[1:07:45.440 --> 1:07:53.440]  Dropped by the site today, order a bag or two and I don't think you're going to be disappointed. Available in original or with our immune support infusion blend.
[1:07:53.440 --> 1:08:02.440]  You will be supporting a free press all the while enjoying a truly great tasting cup of my favorite coffee available at infowarslife.com.
[1:08:02.440 --> 1:08:24.440]  That's why we're just out here doing simple things pointing out that we're meant to be in nature and be natural and this is where we find the source that God made to transcend the New World Order. And that's why they want to try to keep us out of it.
[1:08:33.440 --> 1:08:50.440]  One more thing you need to know about these people, I know how to face this stone. They literally crawl out from under rocks, they have green milk and skin, and they run around screaming, we love Satan, we want to eat babies.
[1:08:50.440 --> 1:09:10.440]  I have them on video. Hillary's in the creepy with six of men. She sleeps in the same room with that creepy with a woman whose mother wears the hood over her head.
[1:09:10.440 --> 1:09:27.440]  That woman number one is ugly. Imagine how bad she smells man. I'm told her and Obama just stink. Obama and Hillary both smell like sulfur.
[1:09:27.440 --> 1:09:34.440]  It's a room vampire pot and a car.
[1:09:34.440 --> 1:09:51.440]  A hobbling round coming after us must fear it gets close to that evil and I feel it go out.
[1:09:51.440 --> 1:09:53.940]  We're such self-centered crap
[1:09:53.940 --> 1:09:55.440]  We don't even notice
[1:09:55.440 --> 1:09:58.440]  And it's self-rising up against us
[1:09:58.440 --> 1:10:01.440]  Millions of pointed people
[1:10:01.440 --> 1:10:03.440]  If the fair was to happen
[1:10:03.440 --> 1:10:06.440]  I'm so pissed
[1:10:06.440 --> 1:10:10.440]  We're gonna stare your daughter at the mall
[1:10:10.440 --> 1:10:14.440]  Oh, oh, oh
[1:10:14.440 --> 1:10:18.440]  We're gonna stare your wife, your son
[1:10:18.440 --> 1:10:22.440]  Oh, oh, oh
[1:10:22.440 --> 1:10:25.440]  We're gonna stare you with a book tonight
[1:10:25.440 --> 1:10:28.440]  And then the police chief is gonna say
[1:10:28.440 --> 1:10:31.440]  We love lost in my lips
[1:10:31.440 --> 1:10:33.440]  We love our Muslims
[1:10:33.440 --> 1:10:35.440]  Oh, they're so good
[1:10:35.440 --> 1:10:54.440]  I was watching Fox News that is here in studio with us
[1:10:54.440 --> 1:10:57.440]  And first they said it's a hateful book even though we haven't read it
[1:10:57.440 --> 1:10:59.440]  We're not gonna allow it to be on the New York Times bestseller list
[1:10:59.440 --> 1:11:02.440]  Which they've announced they do to conservative libertarian books
[1:11:02.440 --> 1:11:06.440]  And then they pulled it and said we're not going to issue the books we've printed now
[1:11:06.440 --> 1:11:10.440]  Modern book burning where the books are destroyed
[1:11:10.440 --> 1:11:13.440]  Before they ever hit the bookstore shelves
[1:11:13.440 --> 1:11:16.440]  His crime is not playing into their official narrative
[1:11:16.440 --> 1:11:19.440]  He's with us here for the next two hours to cover the waterfront
[1:11:19.440 --> 1:11:21.440]  Here in Austin the book is now out
[1:11:21.440 --> 1:11:23.440]  We sell it at infowarstore.com
[1:11:23.440 --> 1:11:25.440]  Dangerous with Milo
[1:11:25.440 --> 1:11:27.440]  And it's got him there with his German Shepherd on the back
[1:11:27.440 --> 1:11:28.440]  Milo, good to have you here
[1:11:28.440 --> 1:11:29.440]  Lovely to meet you
[1:11:29.440 --> 1:11:30.440]  And love to see you again
[1:11:30.440 --> 1:11:32.440]  Yeah, a lot of folks are very excited you're here
[1:11:32.440 --> 1:11:34.440]  Well, thank you. Thanks so much for having me
[1:11:34.440 --> 1:11:37.440]  It's a show that I like to watch even when I'm not on it
[1:11:37.440 --> 1:11:39.440]  Which is the highest compliment I can pay you
[1:11:39.440 --> 1:11:40.440]  Well, thanks for putting up with me
[1:11:40.440 --> 1:11:42.440]  People in our business, you know, that's about as high a compliment as you can pay me
[1:11:42.440 --> 1:11:44.440]  It was good to meet you at the RNC and, you know, Trump won
[1:11:44.440 --> 1:11:46.440]  The other fake polls proved wrong
[1:11:46.440 --> 1:11:49.440]  They've got new fake polls out saying Trump's super unpopular
[1:11:49.440 --> 1:11:53.440]  But the box and computer evidence we have shows he's more popular than ever
[1:11:53.440 --> 1:11:57.440]  Yeah, I mean, I just don't trust anything I read anymore
[1:11:57.440 --> 1:12:00.440]  I just don't believe a bit of it
[1:12:00.440 --> 1:12:03.440]  And it's the most extraordinary thing that's happened to the American media
[1:12:03.440 --> 1:12:05.440]  Which has always been the dumbest media
[1:12:05.440 --> 1:12:07.440]  It's always been the stupidest media of anywhere in the world
[1:12:07.440 --> 1:12:10.440]  I mean, you go to Britain, you know, you've got sharp, smart, brilliant
[1:12:10.440 --> 1:12:13.440]  Incredibly gifted, waspish gadflies
[1:12:13.440 --> 1:12:16.440]  Whether it's the tabloid media or whatever
[1:12:16.440 --> 1:12:17.440]  It comes from American media
[1:12:17.440 --> 1:12:20.440]  And they are, by some margin, the dumbest people
[1:12:20.440 --> 1:12:23.440]  That's the dumbest press anywhere in the western world
[1:12:23.440 --> 1:12:29.440]  And we've gone from sort of pitying them to being, I think, in open warfare with them
[1:12:29.440 --> 1:12:32.440]  Anybody who actually believes in freedom, the First Amendment, the Second Amendment
[1:12:32.440 --> 1:12:36.440]  Any of the things that make this wonderful country, you know, such a fantastic place to live
[1:12:36.440 --> 1:12:37.440]  If you care about any of that stuff
[1:12:37.440 --> 1:12:40.440]  I think you have no option but to be in open warfare against the establishment
[1:12:40.440 --> 1:12:42.440]  That's right, because they are in open war with us
[1:12:42.440 --> 1:12:44.440]  Well, they started it
[1:12:44.440 --> 1:12:47.440]  They're saying kill the president, now they've got Al Gore
[1:12:47.440 --> 1:12:51.440]  They've got Brennan on TV saying we're about to remove the president in a coup
[1:12:51.440 --> 1:12:54.440]  I mean, this is like the twilight zone that they're openly doing this
[1:12:54.440 --> 1:12:56.440]  They banned your book, let's start there
[1:12:56.440 --> 1:13:00.440]  It's now out, dangerous, was banned
[1:13:00.440 --> 1:13:02.440]  Go through that for folks
[1:13:02.440 --> 1:13:03.440]  Well, I had a deal with Simon & Schuster
[1:13:03.440 --> 1:13:07.440]  And the publishing industry is perhaps even worse than the journalism industry
[1:13:07.440 --> 1:13:11.440]  It's about the most left wing of all of the American establishment industries of all
[1:13:11.440 --> 1:13:13.440]  They did a contract with me
[1:13:13.440 --> 1:13:17.440]  And in the contract, in the legal contract, it specifically describes me as controversial
[1:13:17.440 --> 1:13:18.440]  And as a provocateur
[1:13:18.440 --> 1:13:21.440]  So they knew when they signed a deal with me that I was controversial
[1:13:21.440 --> 1:13:22.440]  And that's the whole point
[1:13:22.440 --> 1:13:24.440]  That's why they wanted me, exactly
[1:13:24.440 --> 1:13:27.440]  Now, later on, leftist pressure got to them
[1:13:27.440 --> 1:13:35.440]  And they decided that they're probably going to lose, you know, Roxanne Gay, this fat feminist woman who writes endlessly about how much she eats
[1:13:35.440 --> 1:13:39.440]  Was going to pull her book, and apparently some people out there in America buy stuff like that
[1:13:39.440 --> 1:13:45.440]  And all these other people, they were going to lose so much money from their leftist authors that they, I think they did a business calculation
[1:13:45.440 --> 1:13:49.440]  They said, you know what, let's cut this guy loose because otherwise it's going to cause us problems with our liberal
[1:13:49.440 --> 1:13:55.440]  And they also want to set the president for no platforming where they just put everybody into the phantom zone like YouTube's doing now
[1:13:55.440 --> 1:14:01.440]  Where we don't ban your video, it's still there in another dimension digitally, just no one can see it
[1:14:01.440 --> 1:14:02.440]  Yeah, no one can see it
[1:14:02.440 --> 1:14:07.440]  There's an interstitial over it in case you accidentally do happen upon this contraband material
[1:14:07.440 --> 1:14:10.440]  You can't comment on it, you can't vote on it
[1:14:10.440 --> 1:14:16.440]  I mean, we're going to let you put it up there for people who really, really, really, that you directly send to it
[1:14:16.440 --> 1:14:21.440]  But no one's going to happen upon it, which is of course how everybody gets views on YouTube, it's by people, you know, with our related videos
[1:14:21.440 --> 1:14:24.440]  Or, you know, recommended for you, that's how these sites work
[1:14:24.440 --> 1:14:30.440]  So by denying conservatives and libertarians access to the mechanisms through which these sites grow so quickly
[1:14:30.440 --> 1:14:34.440]  And how people most importantly grow their audiences and grow their businesses
[1:14:34.440 --> 1:14:40.440]  Effectively, you're kind of like cutting them off whilst, you know, in this very slippery way that technically, well, technically we're allowing you on the platform
[1:14:40.440 --> 1:14:44.440]  But all of the best features of the platform, we're going to switch off for you because we don't like what you said
[1:14:44.440 --> 1:14:52.440]  And that's what the Nazis did, they first put you in a ghetto, then they starve you out, they marginalize you, then they ship you off to the forced labor camp
[1:14:52.440 --> 1:14:54.440]  And then of course, they shoot you in the head
[1:14:54.440 --> 1:14:59.440]  Well, I'm hoping Google executives aren't going to come for us with AK-47s
[1:14:59.440 --> 1:15:07.440]  But, you know, the left is calling for murder, for death, for civil war, I mean, you've had your events canceled because they're out there attacking people savagely, I think they have come
[1:15:07.440 --> 1:15:15.440]  I mean, look, people used to laugh at, you know, right-wing media for saying stuff like this and then everything became true
[1:15:15.440 --> 1:15:23.440]  You know, UC Berkeley, I couldn't give a talk about cultural appropriation, the most bizarre, pointless, abstract, academic, you know, nonsense
[1:15:23.440 --> 1:15:29.440]  You're just another way the left is trying to pretend that everybody's racist, and I wanted to give a talk about cultural appropriation, I wanted to wear a Native American headdress
[1:15:29.440 --> 1:15:35.440]  You know, it's a silly campy talk from a British fag who likes to crack fat jokes and they wouldn't allow it to proceed
[1:15:35.440 --> 1:15:38.440]  Something as unthreatening as me, you know, they wouldn't allow it to proceed
[1:15:38.440 --> 1:15:42.440]  So can you imagine what they're doing behind the scenes to people who are not unthreatening?
[1:15:42.440 --> 1:15:50.440]  But, you know, and they burn the town up, they had $100,000 worth of damage to UC Berkeley itself, $500,000 worth of damage to downtown Berkeley
[1:15:50.440 --> 1:15:53.440]  And to say nothing of the violence at the inauguration
[1:15:53.440 --> 1:15:59.440]  And they beat up white lesbian women just because they were white, they must be racist and they deserve to be beat up too, even though they're liberals
[1:15:59.440 --> 1:16:02.440]  I mean, it is just frossing piranha-like behavior
[1:16:02.440 --> 1:16:11.440]  Well, there's this hierarchy of privilege that they've assembled that I talk about in the book, you know, I'm searching for sort of the perfect weapon in our culture war
[1:16:11.440 --> 1:16:14.440]  I want a sort of disabled Muslim lesbian immigrant
[1:16:14.440 --> 1:16:15.440]  Tranny
[1:16:15.440 --> 1:16:16.440]  Yep, yep, thank you
[1:16:16.440 --> 1:16:20.440]  You know, who happens somehow to be a conservative because when we find her, it's all over
[1:16:20.440 --> 1:16:24.440]  You know, when we find her, the identity politics wars are done
[1:16:24.440 --> 1:16:26.440]  But, no, this is hierarchical
[1:16:26.440 --> 1:16:28.440]  I identify as a leprechaun
[1:16:28.440 --> 1:16:32.440]  Do you? Do you? Well, you've got that cheeky smile of the Irish
[1:16:32.440 --> 1:16:33.440]  And I'm not too tall
[1:16:33.440 --> 1:16:34.440]  I can see you as a leprechaun
[1:16:34.440 --> 1:16:35.440]  And I'm bow-legged
[1:16:35.440 --> 1:16:38.440]  Me like a jarbs, me like a jarbs
[1:16:38.440 --> 1:16:41.440]  I'm going to be the first male leprechaun to have a baby too
[1:16:41.440 --> 1:16:43.440]  Really? Really? That's that'll be exciting
[1:16:43.440 --> 1:16:47.440]  This is, you heard it here first, well, I identify as a New York Times best-selling author
[1:16:47.440 --> 1:16:51.440]  Which, despite the machinations of Simon and Schuster, I actually am in the real world
[1:16:51.440 --> 1:16:55.440]  Let's go back to this, because we just glaze over as libertarians and conservatives
[1:16:55.440 --> 1:16:59.440]  You know, we get knocked down, we get back up, we don't turn into drama queens
[1:16:59.440 --> 1:17:03.440]  Imagine if the left had a book banned, a book banned
[1:17:03.440 --> 1:17:05.440]  So your book was banned when it was number one on Amazon
[1:17:05.440 --> 1:17:09.440]  In the top ten on New York Times, banned
[1:17:09.440 --> 1:17:10.440]  Clearly going to number one
[1:17:10.440 --> 1:17:13.440]  So let's talk about that, roll through that and where you are now
[1:17:13.440 --> 1:17:16.440]  Yeah, well, I mean, the book hadn't been released yet
[1:17:16.440 --> 1:17:20.440]  And Simon is used to cave to leftist pressure, I think, because they did a business calculation
[1:17:20.440 --> 1:17:24.440]  And said, you know, the amount of, the left hates this guy so much
[1:17:24.440 --> 1:17:26.440]  That it's going to impact our business elsewhere
[1:17:26.440 --> 1:17:28.440]  Well, the thing, they're not entitled to do that
[1:17:28.440 --> 1:17:31.440]  If they were planning to cave to leftist pressure, they thought it might be a risk
[1:17:31.440 --> 1:17:32.440]  They shouldn't have signed a deal with me
[1:17:32.440 --> 1:17:35.440]  This actually isn't so much a free speech thing as a contract thing
[1:17:35.440 --> 1:17:38.440]  As a, you know, are they going to stick to their word?
[1:17:38.440 --> 1:17:39.440]  They did a deal with me
[1:17:39.440 --> 1:17:41.440]  These publishers like to make money from conservatives
[1:17:41.440 --> 1:17:44.440]  They will sign up Mark Levin and Rush Limbaugh
[1:17:44.440 --> 1:17:47.440]  And all these other big selling authors make money from them
[1:17:47.440 --> 1:17:50.440]  And use that money to give Lena Dunham, Amy Schumer and Hillary Clinton
[1:17:50.440 --> 1:17:52.440]  Multi-million dollar advances they never own back
[1:17:52.440 --> 1:17:54.440]  So they make money out of conservatives
[1:17:54.440 --> 1:17:57.440]  They make money out of you guys by selling books from people you like
[1:17:57.440 --> 1:18:01.440]  And they kind of, you know, they publish conservative authors with tweezers
[1:18:01.440 --> 1:18:02.440]  Like holding their nose while they're doing it
[1:18:02.440 --> 1:18:05.440]  They're probably happy to collect checks, but they don't really want to be associated
[1:18:05.440 --> 1:18:07.440]  So they do these things called imprints
[1:18:07.440 --> 1:18:10.440]  Where conservative authors, for instance, with Simon and Schuster
[1:18:10.440 --> 1:18:11.440]  Aren't published by Simon and Schuster
[1:18:11.440 --> 1:18:13.440]  They're published by threshold editions
[1:18:13.440 --> 1:18:15.440]  So Simon and Schuster can say, oh, that's just the conservative imprint
[1:18:15.440 --> 1:18:17.440]  But they're probably happy to collect the money, you know
[1:18:17.440 --> 1:18:19.440]  Again, they're putting people in ghettos
[1:18:19.440 --> 1:18:21.440]  Exactly, but they are, they are
[1:18:21.440 --> 1:18:24.440]  But then the ghettos become the most popular avant-garde areas
[1:18:24.440 --> 1:18:26.440]  Don't they understand the Streisand effect?
[1:18:26.440 --> 1:18:29.440]  No, and the problem is, if you're going to throw a house party
[1:18:29.440 --> 1:18:32.440]  And say if you go to their house party, you can't come to our house party
[1:18:32.440 --> 1:18:34.440]  You better make sure your party's the best one
[1:18:34.440 --> 1:18:38.440]  And unfortunately for them, libertarians and conservatives are throwing the best parties right now
[1:18:38.440 --> 1:18:41.440]  You know, we're so much more joyful and fun
[1:18:41.440 --> 1:18:43.440]  And more inclusive, we don't care what you're like
[1:18:43.440 --> 1:18:45.440]  As long as you're not hitting us over the head with bike locks
[1:18:45.440 --> 1:18:48.440]  No, exactly, I mean, it's an adherence to principle
[1:18:48.440 --> 1:18:51.440]  Like we just want to be able to say, do and be whatever we want and get left alone
[1:18:51.440 --> 1:18:52.440]  But isn't that the big secret?
[1:18:52.440 --> 1:18:56.440]  We'll call ourselves conservatives because we, you know, don't mind the attacks
[1:18:56.440 --> 1:19:00.440]  But I've always just been a libertarian, free thinking, open society guy
[1:19:00.440 --> 1:19:03.440]  It's the left trying to kill classical liberalism
[1:19:03.440 --> 1:19:05.440]  And so I see them as very anti-liberal
[1:19:05.440 --> 1:19:07.440]  I don't think these terms mean anything
[1:19:07.440 --> 1:19:09.440]  Well, it's a kind of quirk of linguistic history, isn't it?
[1:19:09.440 --> 1:19:11.440]  The left in America are called liberal
[1:19:11.440 --> 1:19:14.440]  When they have nothing to do with the liberals, they have no liberal qualities
[1:19:14.440 --> 1:19:15.440]  They don't believe in any liberal things
[1:19:15.440 --> 1:19:19.440]  Classical liberalism was supposed to be about doing whatever you want so long as
[1:19:19.440 --> 1:19:22.440]  It doesn't hurt anybody else, JS Mill on liberty, the harm principle
[1:19:22.440 --> 1:19:28.440]  You know, do whatever you want provided that you don't, your actions don't negatively impact the people around you
[1:19:28.440 --> 1:19:31.440]  Well, that's literally the opposite of the American left
[1:19:31.440 --> 1:19:33.440]  You know, they seem to want to regulate
[1:19:33.440 --> 1:19:36.440]  Run every language, every, I mean, they want total control
[1:19:36.440 --> 1:19:38.440]  Well, you could wear, I mean, you know, what if I want dreadlocks?
[1:19:38.440 --> 1:19:40.440]  No, you're white, that makes you a racist
[1:19:40.440 --> 1:19:45.440]  No, that's, you know, this cultural appropriation thing I was going to talk about, UC Berkeley
[1:19:45.440 --> 1:19:47.440]  Is another way the left tries to imply everyone's racist
[1:19:47.440 --> 1:19:51.440]  It says, if you haven't suffered the injustices as a member of a particular culture
[1:19:51.440 --> 1:19:54.440]  Sure, it starts with banning Halloween parties and soon it's everything
[1:19:54.440 --> 1:19:58.440]  Milo Yiannopoulos is whether it's the new book available everywhere, dangerous with Milo
[1:19:58.440 --> 1:20:01.440]  They don't want you to read it, well, it's available at infowarstore.com

[1:22:10.440 --> 1:22:11.440]  That's a tall order
[1:22:11.440 --> 1:22:16.440]  But you can get all of that with properly designed participating whole life insurance
[1:22:16.440 --> 1:22:19.440]  Most people think life insurance pays after you're dead
[1:22:19.440 --> 1:22:20.440]  That's true
[1:22:20.440 --> 1:22:24.440]  But you can have tax-free access to use your life insurance while you're alive

[1:24:21.440 --> 1:24:23.440]  Looking for an adventure
[1:24:23.440 --> 1:24:27.440]  But don't annoy a liberal because they control language
[1:24:27.440 --> 1:24:29.440]  Don't have a Halloween party, don't have a costume party
[1:24:29.440 --> 1:24:30.440]  Don't try to have a speech
[1:24:30.440 --> 1:24:32.440]  Don't try to publish a book
[1:24:32.440 --> 1:24:36.440]  Don't criticize Muslims that are cutting people's gendals off and throwing gays off buildings
[1:24:36.440 --> 1:24:39.440]  Because if you do, we'll call for you to be put in prison
[1:24:39.440 --> 1:24:41.440]  My loyanopoulos is our guest
[1:24:41.440 --> 1:24:43.440]  We're going to open the phones up in the second hour
[1:24:43.440 --> 1:24:47.440]  The book is dangerous, banned by a major publisher
[1:24:47.440 --> 1:24:50.440]  So finish up with the saga of that because it's so interesting
[1:24:50.440 --> 1:24:51.440]  Because it was just in the news
[1:24:51.440 --> 1:24:54.440]  Well, he deserves to have his book when it's the bestseller pulled
[1:24:54.440 --> 1:24:57.440]  I mean, this is unprecedented digital book burning
[1:24:57.440 --> 1:24:58.440]  It is
[1:24:58.440 --> 1:25:03.440]  And it was just the most remarkable thing for me to have them cave to leftist pressure
[1:25:03.440 --> 1:25:04.440]  I mean, they're not entitled to do that
[1:25:04.440 --> 1:25:06.440]  If you're going to do that, don't sign deals with conservatives
[1:25:06.440 --> 1:25:07.440]  Don't take our money
[1:25:07.440 --> 1:25:09.440]  Don't take our readers' money
[1:25:09.440 --> 1:25:10.440]  Go try and make money if you can
[1:25:10.440 --> 1:25:14.440]  Off Amy Schumer and Lena Dunham so long as people find these
[1:25:14.440 --> 1:25:15.440]  Which they can't
[1:25:15.440 --> 1:25:17.440]  They just force feed us these people
[1:25:17.440 --> 1:25:21.440]  These people were instructed to find beautiful and instructed to find talented
[1:25:21.440 --> 1:25:25.440]  Remember, they banned you off Twitter for criticizing women as the Ghostbusters
[1:25:25.440 --> 1:25:27.440]  That Ghostbusters movie was so awful
[1:25:27.440 --> 1:25:28.440]  It bankrupted the studio
[1:25:28.440 --> 1:25:31.440]  I had the temerity to criticize Leslie Jones-Pomps
[1:25:31.440 --> 1:25:33.440]  And by the way, I actually stood up for her
[1:25:33.440 --> 1:25:38.440]  I said it was a shame that she had to do that whole stereotypical black woman routine
[1:25:38.440 --> 1:25:42.440]  And it would be nice if somebody could just happen to be a black woman on screen
[1:25:42.440 --> 1:25:44.440]  And didn't have to play up to the stereotype
[1:25:44.440 --> 1:25:47.440]  I thought if I was the kind of person to be offended by that kind of thing
[1:25:47.440 --> 1:25:48.440]  I might have found it patronizing
[1:25:48.440 --> 1:25:49.440]  I was sticking up for her
[1:25:49.440 --> 1:25:51.440]  And they still came for me anyway
[1:25:51.440 --> 1:25:52.440]  Well, that's the thing
[1:25:52.440 --> 1:25:54.440]  People say, hey, I'm not being racist, don't ban me
[1:25:54.440 --> 1:25:57.440]  We need to say, listen, everybody's got free speech
[1:25:57.440 --> 1:25:58.440]  As long as you don't call for violence
[1:25:58.440 --> 1:26:00.440]  But instead, they can call for violence
[1:26:00.440 --> 1:26:01.440]  Then we're restricted
[1:26:01.440 --> 1:26:02.440]  Well, they do call for violence
[1:26:02.440 --> 1:26:04.440]  And they don't just call for it, but they do it
[1:26:04.440 --> 1:26:06.440]  And they do it outside my college talks
[1:26:06.440 --> 1:26:08.440]  They do it with the president's inauguration
[1:26:08.440 --> 1:26:09.440]  They do it all over the place
[1:26:09.440 --> 1:26:11.440]  And they're perfectly happy to threaten it
[1:26:11.440 --> 1:26:12.440]  And they're perfectly happy to see through on their threats
[1:26:12.440 --> 1:26:16.440]  And when you see Yvette Falaka, for instance, that's a schoolteacher
[1:26:16.440 --> 1:26:17.440]  She's a schoolteacher
[1:26:17.440 --> 1:26:21.440]  A member of By Any Means Necessary, which is kind of like Antifa Light
[1:26:21.440 --> 1:26:24.440]  You know, they won't quite admit that they go and smash things up
[1:26:24.440 --> 1:26:26.440]  But By Any Means Necessary, the clue's in the name, isn't it?
[1:26:26.440 --> 1:26:27.440]  You know, she's a schoolteacher
[1:26:27.440 --> 1:26:30.440]  And she's going on Tucker Carlson proudly saying this
[1:26:30.440 --> 1:26:31.440]  We're very happy that we got Milo shut down
[1:26:31.440 --> 1:26:32.440]  We're very happy
[1:26:32.440 --> 1:26:35.440]  And he's like, well, you're using violence to stop political speech
[1:26:35.440 --> 1:26:37.440]  That's like the definition of fascism
[1:26:37.440 --> 1:26:39.440]  And she says, no, he is a hate monger
[1:26:39.440 --> 1:26:40.440]  And calling for genocide
[1:26:40.440 --> 1:26:42.440]  I said, what do you mean calling for genocide?
[1:26:42.440 --> 1:26:43.440]  Where's your evidence?
[1:26:43.440 --> 1:26:44.440]  And she said, he's just hateful
[1:26:44.440 --> 1:26:47.440]  You know, you push them to a certain point
[1:26:47.440 --> 1:26:48.440]  And it's the same old thing
[1:26:48.440 --> 1:26:50.440]  You get to a certain point with liberals
[1:26:50.440 --> 1:26:51.440]  You get to a certain point with progressives
[1:26:51.440 --> 1:26:53.440]  And it's just, I don't like you
[1:26:53.440 --> 1:26:54.440]  Therefore, you're evil
[1:26:54.440 --> 1:26:56.440]  Therefore, you can't be allowed a platform
[1:26:56.440 --> 1:26:58.440]  This idea of hate speech, which really just means you're conservative
[1:26:58.440 --> 1:27:00.440]  And I don't have any facts to disprove you
[1:27:00.440 --> 1:27:02.440]  So we must drive you out of public life
[1:27:02.440 --> 1:27:03.440]  This is what happened with this book
[1:27:03.440 --> 1:27:05.440]  Unfortunately, I mean, I went out, I raised money myself
[1:27:05.440 --> 1:27:06.440]  I got it published
[1:27:06.440 --> 1:27:08.440]  I started my own imprint, in fact
[1:27:08.440 --> 1:27:10.440]  And now I hope to publish other people
[1:27:10.440 --> 1:27:12.440]  Isn't that the way to get around the censorship?
[1:27:12.440 --> 1:27:15.440]  Is this we just leave the structure and build our own?
[1:27:15.440 --> 1:27:16.440]  I think it is
[1:27:16.440 --> 1:27:18.440]  And conservatives have been talking about this for decades
[1:27:18.440 --> 1:27:20.440]  But they spend a lot of time talking and not much time doing
[1:27:20.440 --> 1:27:22.440]  And I think one of the things that you and I have in common
[1:27:22.440 --> 1:27:24.440]  Is that we've actually gone out and done the things
[1:27:24.440 --> 1:27:25.440]  I mean, you've built your own network
[1:27:25.440 --> 1:27:28.440]  You've built your own entirely parallel media ecosystem
[1:27:28.440 --> 1:27:30.440]  So that you don't have to be reliant on these people
[1:27:30.440 --> 1:27:32.440]  Which is exactly what conservatives would be doing
[1:27:32.440 --> 1:27:34.440]  If they put their money where their mouth is
[1:27:34.440 --> 1:27:36.440]  Instead of writing ponderous articles
[1:27:36.440 --> 1:27:38.440]  For National Review and Commentary magazine
[1:27:38.440 --> 1:27:39.440]  About how we ought to do it
[1:27:39.440 --> 1:27:40.440]  You've gone and done it
[1:27:40.440 --> 1:27:41.440]  I've started publishing imprint
[1:27:41.440 --> 1:27:42.440]  And now I can publish not just me
[1:27:42.440 --> 1:27:43.440]  But other people too
[1:27:43.440 --> 1:27:44.440]  You know, other people I like
[1:27:44.440 --> 1:27:45.440]  Who can't find
[1:27:45.440 --> 1:27:46.440]  That which doesn't kill you
[1:27:46.440 --> 1:27:47.440]  Only makes you stronger
[1:27:47.440 --> 1:27:49.440]  During the break, you said some important things
[1:27:49.440 --> 1:27:51.440]  About thinning the herd
[1:27:51.440 --> 1:27:53.440]  What their pressure's done to us
[1:27:53.440 --> 1:27:57.440]  Yeah, I think the progressive mission
[1:27:57.440 --> 1:28:00.440]  To make it as expensive and difficult
[1:28:00.440 --> 1:28:02.440]  And stressful and exhausting and complicated
[1:28:02.440 --> 1:28:04.440]  As possible to be a conservative
[1:28:04.440 --> 1:28:05.440]  Or a libertarian in public life
[1:28:05.440 --> 1:28:07.440]  Has an inevitable effect
[1:28:07.440 --> 1:28:10.440]  And it is that only people with superhuman stamina
[1:28:10.440 --> 1:28:12.440]  And resources are able to survive
[1:28:12.440 --> 1:28:13.440]  So you need to have money
[1:28:13.440 --> 1:28:15.440]  You need to be one of those people
[1:28:15.440 --> 1:28:17.440]  That just can take the licks and keep on getting up
[1:28:17.440 --> 1:28:20.440]  Now, you and I both have some personal qualities
[1:28:20.440 --> 1:28:23.440]  That mean that we'll take it
[1:28:23.440 --> 1:28:24.440]  We'll get up the next day
[1:28:24.440 --> 1:28:25.440]  And we'll come back twice as hard
[1:28:25.440 --> 1:28:27.440]  But everybody is like that
[1:28:27.440 --> 1:28:28.440]  And certainly most of the people on the left
[1:28:28.440 --> 1:28:29.440]  Aren't like that
[1:28:29.440 --> 1:28:31.440]  But to survive at all in conservative media
[1:28:31.440 --> 1:28:33.440]  In public, you have to be like that
[1:28:33.440 --> 1:28:34.440]  Because of what they do to you
[1:28:34.440 --> 1:28:36.440]  And that's, I think, one of the reasons
[1:28:36.440 --> 1:28:38.440]  There's so little talent on the conservative
[1:28:38.440 --> 1:28:39.440]  Right in America
[1:28:39.440 --> 1:28:41.440]  And what's crazy is people think
[1:28:41.440 --> 1:28:44.440]  Getting attacked by scum
[1:28:44.440 --> 1:28:46.440]  And by people that are control freaks is bad
[1:28:46.440 --> 1:28:49.440]  It's good, it's the animating contest of liberty
[1:28:49.440 --> 1:28:50.440]  It's like if we didn't have gravity
[1:28:50.440 --> 1:28:52.440]  We'd be jellyfish
[1:28:52.440 --> 1:28:53.440]  These people are making us stronger
[1:28:53.440 --> 1:28:55.440]  It's enjoyable now
[1:28:55.440 --> 1:28:57.440]  To have them put more weight on me
[1:28:57.440 --> 1:28:58.440]  And then break free
[1:28:58.440 --> 1:28:59.440]  Because like doomsday
[1:28:59.440 --> 1:29:01.440]  Every time they attack, we get stronger
[1:29:01.440 --> 1:29:02.440]  Yes, what does not break me
[1:29:02.440 --> 1:29:04.440]  Only makes me more fabulous
[1:29:04.440 --> 1:29:06.440]  Come on, let's just compare it
[1:29:06.440 --> 1:29:08.440]  Those of us that have made it through their attacks
[1:29:08.440 --> 1:29:09.440]  Are like doomsday now
[1:29:09.440 --> 1:29:10.440]  And that's how they see it
[1:29:10.440 --> 1:29:11.440]  We're indestructible
[1:29:11.440 --> 1:29:13.440]  No wonder they hate us so much
[1:29:13.440 --> 1:29:15.440]  No wonder they fear us so much
[1:29:15.440 --> 1:29:17.440]  No wonder they cannot allow our college talks
[1:29:17.440 --> 1:29:19.440]  Or our TV shows or our media appearances
[1:29:19.440 --> 1:29:23.440]  To proceed unedited, untrammeled, unsabotaged
[1:29:23.440 --> 1:29:25.440]  Because after everything they've thrown at us
[1:29:25.440 --> 1:29:26.440]  The fact that we're still standing
[1:29:26.440 --> 1:29:28.440]  And still just as defiant
[1:29:28.440 --> 1:29:30.440]  And have just as big audiences
[1:29:30.440 --> 1:29:33.440]  If not even more huge than before
[1:29:33.440 --> 1:29:34.440]  Makes us terrible
[1:29:34.440 --> 1:29:35.440]  Exactly, and Trump's the same
[1:29:35.440 --> 1:29:36.440]  So let's look at Trump
[1:29:36.440 --> 1:29:38.440]  And talk about where you see him going
[1:29:38.440 --> 1:29:39.440]  What he's done right, what he's done wrong
[1:29:39.440 --> 1:29:41.440]  Six months in with Milo Yiannopoulos
[1:29:41.440 --> 1:29:42.440]  The new best-selling book
[1:29:42.440 --> 1:29:45.440]  Dangerous, available at infowarstore.com

[1:30:19.440 --> 1:30:21.440]  And I've been testing this formula
[1:30:21.440 --> 1:30:23.440]  And making changes to this formula
[1:30:23.440 --> 1:30:24.440]  For over 10 years
[1:30:24.440 --> 1:30:26.440]  It's available at infowarstore.com

[1:30:37.440 --> 1:30:38.440]  It's been incredible

[1:30:49.440 --> 1:30:51.440]  I cannot sell something
[1:30:51.440 --> 1:30:53.440]  Unless it helps somebody
[1:30:53.440 --> 1:30:54.440]  And you can't support an organization
[1:30:54.440 --> 1:30:55.440]  That didn't fight hard
[1:30:55.440 --> 1:30:57.440]  Look at the response we're getting
[1:30:57.440 --> 1:30:58.440]  Whoever changed the world together
[1:30:58.440 --> 1:30:59.440]  You are the Info War
[1:30:59.440 --> 1:31:28.440]  God bless you all.
[1:31:29.440 --> 1:31:30.440]  The larger the particle

[1:32:01.440 --> 1:32:04.440]  Thousands of years ago
[1:32:04.440 --> 1:32:06.440]  There was a basic form of chivalry
[1:32:06.440 --> 1:32:09.440]  Our ancestors would hear the drums of war
[1:32:09.440 --> 1:32:11.440]  Giving the warriors of the tribe a chance
[1:32:11.440 --> 1:32:14.440]  To organize and prepare a defense
[1:32:14.440 --> 1:32:17.440]  Sixty years ago, when foreign air forces
[1:32:17.440 --> 1:32:19.440]  Were approaching filled with bombs
[1:32:19.440 --> 1:32:21.440]  They had drums of their own
[1:32:21.440 --> 1:32:22.440]  Air raid sirens
[1:32:22.440 --> 1:32:24.440]  But in the 21st century
[1:32:24.440 --> 1:32:27.440]  There are silent weapons for quiet war
[1:32:27.440 --> 1:32:29.440]  Pathogens added to the food and water
[1:32:29.440 --> 1:32:31.440]  Into the lining of plastics

[1:32:33.440 --> 1:32:34.440]  Turn off our hormones
[1:32:34.440 --> 1:32:37.440]  And accelerate our journey towards death

[1:33:33.440 --> 1:33:34.440]  That's right
[1:33:34.440 --> 1:33:35.440]  The mountain might get him
[1:33:35.440 --> 1:33:37.440]  But the law never will
[1:33:37.440 --> 1:33:40.440]  The only way they know how
[1:33:40.440 --> 1:33:42.440]  Milo is here in studio with us
[1:33:42.440 --> 1:33:44.440]  He's already got the best-selling book
[1:33:44.440 --> 1:33:46.440]  That they pulled off the shelves
[1:33:46.440 --> 1:33:48.440]  And now it's back reborn with his own
[1:33:48.440 --> 1:33:51.440]  Publishing operation already climbing the charts
[1:33:51.440 --> 1:33:52.440]  And a much better cover
[1:33:52.440 --> 1:33:54.440]  Than Simon issues to have as well
[1:33:54.440 --> 1:33:55.440]  I look far more handsome
[1:33:55.440 --> 1:33:56.440]  Than they wanted me to look
[1:33:56.440 --> 1:33:58.440]  Which is of course the most important thing

[1:34:06.440 --> 1:34:08.440]  That is the best URL ever
[1:34:08.440 --> 1:34:09.440]  I bet you paid handsomely for it
[1:34:09.440 --> 1:34:10.440]  I am jealous
[1:34:10.440 --> 1:34:12.440]  I won't tell you how much I paid for it
[1:34:12.440 --> 1:34:13.440]  But I'm very happy to have acquired
[1:34:13.440 --> 1:34:14.440]  Dangerous.com
[1:34:14.440 --> 1:34:15.440]  I'm gonna keep...
[1:34:15.440 --> 1:34:16.440]  I'm gonna...
[1:34:16.440 --> 1:34:17.440]  Once the book is kind of...
[1:34:17.440 --> 1:34:18.440]  The book tour is over
[1:34:18.440 --> 1:34:19.440]  I'm gonna hand it over
[1:34:19.440 --> 1:34:20.440]  To the imprint that we set up
[1:34:20.440 --> 1:34:21.440]  Dangerous Books
[1:34:21.440 --> 1:34:23.440]  That is like the best
[1:34:23.440 --> 1:34:24.440]  In this whole media climate
[1:34:24.440 --> 1:34:26.440]  I couldn't think of a better...
[1:34:26.440 --> 1:34:27.440]  Well, I'll give you an email address
[1:34:27.440 --> 1:34:28.440]  Alexatdangerous.com
[1:34:28.440 --> 1:34:29.440]  If you're gay
[1:34:29.440 --> 1:34:31.440]  The blaze would be pretty good
[1:34:31.440 --> 1:34:32.440]  I'm sorry
[1:34:32.440 --> 1:34:33.440]  I'm sorry
[1:34:33.440 --> 1:34:34.440]  I'm sorry
[1:34:34.440 --> 1:34:35.440]  Oh, Glenn Beck's
[1:34:35.440 --> 1:34:36.440]  One more of a fag than I am
[1:34:36.440 --> 1:34:38.440]  Oh, there's no doubt
[1:34:38.440 --> 1:34:40.440]  I'm sorry
[1:34:40.440 --> 1:34:42.440]  No, I'll leave that to the other...
[1:34:42.440 --> 1:34:43.440]  The other big gay
[1:34:43.440 --> 1:34:44.440]  That'll be in the news
[1:34:44.440 --> 1:34:45.440]  I'll leave that to the other big
[1:34:45.440 --> 1:34:47.440]  Gay-lord in conservative media
[1:34:47.440 --> 1:34:48.440]  No
[1:34:50.440 --> 1:34:52.440]  Tonight at dinner in Dallas
[1:34:52.440 --> 1:34:53.440]  Hilionopoulos
[1:34:53.440 --> 1:34:55.440]  And Glenn Beck at Gay Lords
[1:34:55.440 --> 1:34:56.440]  Sorry
[1:34:56.440 --> 1:34:57.440]  They got food there
[1:34:57.440 --> 1:34:59.440]  He called me a threat to the Republic
[1:34:59.440 --> 1:35:00.440]  He called me Goebbels
[1:35:00.440 --> 1:35:03.440]  And they say that we have loose mouths
[1:35:03.440 --> 1:35:05.440]  I mean, what is wrong with them?
[1:35:05.440 --> 1:35:07.440]  Well, you know, he's the new guy
[1:35:07.440 --> 1:35:08.440]  Who goes around as the Judas Code
[1:35:08.440 --> 1:35:10.440]  And goes, conservatives are all faking frauds
[1:35:10.440 --> 1:35:11.440]  I'm one, I'm sorry
[1:35:11.440 --> 1:35:15.440]  He crawls around on failed establishment publications
[1:35:15.440 --> 1:35:17.440]  Always trying to sabotage everything
[1:35:17.440 --> 1:35:19.440]  You just see his name in the New York Times
[1:35:19.440 --> 1:35:20.440]  You're like, what are you doing?
[1:35:20.440 --> 1:35:22.440]  And he thinks it's some kind of victory
[1:35:22.440 --> 1:35:24.440]  It's like, I am parking my tanks on their lawn
[1:35:24.440 --> 1:35:26.440]  I'm making this insurgency
[1:35:26.440 --> 1:35:28.440]  Into the enemy territory
[1:35:28.440 --> 1:35:30.440]  No, they're laughing at you
[1:35:30.440 --> 1:35:31.440]  They've, you know, they have...
[1:35:31.440 --> 1:35:32.440]  Well, that's what...
[1:35:32.440 --> 1:35:33.440] ...neuded you
[1:35:33.440 --> 1:35:35.440]  He's like, what's the one in Game of Thrones?
[1:35:35.440 --> 1:35:36.440]  That is...
[1:35:37.440 --> 1:35:38.440]  He's a Gelder
[1:35:38.440 --> 1:35:39.440]  He's a eunuch
[1:35:39.440 --> 1:35:40.440]  He's a eunuch
[1:35:40.440 --> 1:35:41.440]  They've cut it off
[1:35:41.440 --> 1:35:42.440]  They've chopped it off
[1:35:42.440 --> 1:35:43.440]  Well, the word is actually
[1:35:43.440 --> 1:35:44.440]  And I'm not against this
[1:35:44.440 --> 1:35:46.440]  Glenn Beck actually was a woman
[1:35:46.440 --> 1:35:48.440]  That transitioned into a man
[1:35:48.440 --> 1:35:49.440]  Do you think so?
[1:35:49.440 --> 1:35:51.440]  Actually, I heard he's pregnant
[1:35:51.440 --> 1:35:52.440]  Really?
[1:35:52.440 --> 1:35:53.440]  No, no, I'm serious
[1:35:53.440 --> 1:35:54.440]  This is breaking
[1:35:54.440 --> 1:35:56.440]  Every day, the Daily Mail seems to find
[1:35:56.440 --> 1:35:57.440]  Some new pregnant man
[1:35:57.440 --> 1:35:58.440]  And I just know
[1:35:58.440 --> 1:35:59.440]  Given a couple of days
[1:35:59.440 --> 1:36:00.440]  The next one's going to be Glenn
[1:36:00.440 --> 1:36:02.440]  56 from Texas
[1:36:03.440 --> 1:36:04.440]  Let me bring you the...
[1:36:04.440 --> 1:36:05.440]  Let me give the next news
[1:36:05.440 --> 1:36:06.440]  It's my baby
[1:36:07.440 --> 1:36:08.440]  Wow
[1:36:08.440 --> 1:36:09.440]  Well, that really would be something
[1:36:09.440 --> 1:36:10.440]  I'm going to be honest
[1:36:10.440 --> 1:36:12.440]  I've had a relationship with one back for a long time
[1:36:12.440 --> 1:36:13.440]  What would your celebrity name be?
[1:36:13.440 --> 1:36:15.440]  Alec Glalix
[1:36:18.440 --> 1:36:19.440]  Glalix
[1:36:19.440 --> 1:36:22.440]  Your celebrity couple name is Glalix
[1:36:22.440 --> 1:36:24.440]  The Glalix empire that attacked Earth
[1:36:24.440 --> 1:36:25.440]  From its Mars base
[1:36:25.440 --> 1:36:28.440]  The little Glenn Beck Alex Jones clone babies
[1:36:28.440 --> 1:36:30.440]  That would be an ugly baby
[1:36:32.440 --> 1:36:34.440]  To the extent that it was Glenn's, yeah
[1:36:34.440 --> 1:36:35.440]  No, no, you're being nice
[1:36:35.440 --> 1:36:37.440]  I mean, Glenn is a good-looking woman
[1:36:41.440 --> 1:36:42.440]  He has...
[1:36:42.440 --> 1:36:43.440]  I'm sure he has some virtues
[1:36:43.440 --> 1:36:45.440]  I haven't discovered any of them yet
[1:36:45.440 --> 1:36:46.440]  What it is is being hyper jealous
[1:36:46.440 --> 1:36:48.440]  Of anybody getting more attention than him
[1:36:48.440 --> 1:36:50.440]  I think that's it
[1:36:50.440 --> 1:36:51.440]  I think I've noticed that about him
[1:36:51.440 --> 1:36:54.440]  When I started to get a bit of a media profile
[1:36:54.440 --> 1:36:56.440]  And I teased him lightly
[1:36:56.440 --> 1:36:57.440]  In a bright bar column
[1:36:57.440 --> 1:36:59.440]  Just a little bit of gentle teasing
[1:36:59.440 --> 1:37:00.440]  And he comes down on me
[1:37:00.440 --> 1:37:02.440]  Like a ton of bricks on his radio show
[1:37:02.440 --> 1:37:04.440]  Saying this guy is a threat to the Republic
[1:37:04.440 --> 1:37:05.440]  He's the new Goebbels
[1:37:05.440 --> 1:37:06.440]  Oh, he takes himself really seriously
[1:37:06.440 --> 1:37:07.440]  Oh, my goodness
[1:37:07.440 --> 1:37:08.440]  He's really not a woman
[1:37:08.440 --> 1:37:09.440]  He's Moses
[1:37:09.440 --> 1:37:11.440]  He's just missing the big beard
[1:37:11.440 --> 1:37:13.440]  Like he went up on the mountain, Milo
[1:37:13.440 --> 1:37:14.440]  He came down
[1:37:14.440 --> 1:37:15.440]  You're supposed to bow down to him
[1:37:15.440 --> 1:37:17.440]  I don't think he's ever recovered
[1:37:17.440 --> 1:37:19.440]  From that march he did
[1:37:19.440 --> 1:37:21.440]  Which... it's a sort of mess...
[1:37:21.440 --> 1:37:23.440]  There's something messianic about him
[1:37:23.440 --> 1:37:25.440]  Except it's a sort of tragedy
[1:37:25.440 --> 1:37:27.440]  In the... in the Hegelian sense of tragedy
[1:37:27.440 --> 1:37:29.440]  Where you've got these sort of warring ideas
[1:37:29.440 --> 1:37:30.440]  About good and evil
[1:37:30.440 --> 1:37:31.440]  And he no longer...
[1:37:31.440 --> 1:37:33.440]  He no longer has a conservative moral compass
[1:37:33.440 --> 1:37:35.440]  So he doesn't really understand
[1:37:35.440 --> 1:37:36.440]  What's right and wrong anymore
[1:37:36.440 --> 1:37:39.440]  He just knows that he's really, really, really important
[1:37:41.440 --> 1:37:43.440]  What's up with the creepy sweaters, too?
[1:37:43.440 --> 1:37:47.440]  He dresses like an elderly gay antiques dealer
[1:37:51.440 --> 1:37:53.440]  You just imagined that these horse-to-nay glasses
[1:37:53.440 --> 1:37:55.440]  That he's looking down his nose at...
[1:37:55.440 --> 1:37:57.440]  You know, at this new-bile young boys
[1:37:57.440 --> 1:37:59.440]  In the antiques shop or something
[1:37:59.440 --> 1:38:01.440]  Oh, my goodness
[1:38:01.440 --> 1:38:02.440]  Oh, boy
[1:38:02.440 --> 1:38:03.440]  Well, you know, that's nothing
[1:38:03.440 --> 1:38:04.440]  The good news is that was yesterday's
[1:38:04.440 --> 1:38:06.440]  They said he could never do broadcasts
[1:38:06.440 --> 1:38:09.440]  Because he was too busy always designing the interior
[1:38:09.440 --> 1:38:10.440]  And, like...
[1:38:10.440 --> 1:38:12.440]  Look at the offices in the blaze
[1:38:12.440 --> 1:38:14.440]  You know, no wonder the network's gone to shit
[1:38:14.440 --> 1:38:16.440]  He spent all the time picking the drapes
[1:38:16.440 --> 1:38:18.440]  And forgot to come up with a business model
[1:38:18.440 --> 1:38:19.440]  That's what they said
[1:38:19.440 --> 1:38:20.440]  But, again, I love it
[1:38:20.440 --> 1:38:21.440]  Yours is called Dangerous
[1:38:21.440 --> 1:38:23.440]  Which is real-heart, dangerous to tyrants
[1:38:23.440 --> 1:38:25.440]  The best name ever
[1:38:25.440 --> 1:38:26.440]  He picked the blaze
[1:38:26.440 --> 1:38:28.440]  Do you not get the Freudian slip?
[1:38:29.440 --> 1:38:31.440]  You know what's so ridiculous about him?
[1:38:31.440 --> 1:38:33.440]  I mean, say what you want about Tommy Lahren
[1:38:33.440 --> 1:38:34.440]  I think she's pretty cool
[1:38:34.440 --> 1:38:35.440]  Are you attracted to Glenn Beckle?
[1:38:35.440 --> 1:38:36.440]  Get him right there
[1:38:36.440 --> 1:38:37.440]  He looks like a chipmunk
[1:38:37.440 --> 1:38:38.440]  No
[1:38:38.440 --> 1:38:39.440]  So, the only...
[1:38:39.440 --> 1:38:41.440]  The only personality on his network
[1:38:41.440 --> 1:38:44.440]  That ever had any hope of making it big-time
[1:38:44.440 --> 1:38:46.440]  He just neglected and mismanaged
[1:38:46.440 --> 1:38:47.440]  And later said he would never have hired
[1:38:47.440 --> 1:38:48.440]  If he'd ever seen her or met her
[1:38:48.440 --> 1:38:49.440]  Tommy Lahren, you know?
[1:38:49.440 --> 1:38:50.440]  Absolutely
[1:38:50.440 --> 1:38:51.440]  I mean, say what you want about it
[1:38:51.440 --> 1:38:53.440]  I think she was silly for doing what she did on the view
[1:38:53.440 --> 1:38:54.440]  I think it's...
[1:38:54.440 --> 1:38:57.440]  You know, I don't think she should have let them...
[1:38:57.440 --> 1:38:58.440]  You sort of bully her into doing it
[1:38:58.440 --> 1:39:01.440]  Well, Dana Loche is a firecracker, too
[1:39:01.440 --> 1:39:04.440]  Oh, okay, so Dana's got some spunk, as we say
[1:39:04.440 --> 1:39:06.440]  I mean, to quote Glenn Zeppelin,
[1:39:06.440 --> 1:39:08.440]  I can watch the honey drip can't keep away
[1:39:08.440 --> 1:39:09.440]  Right, but she...
[1:39:09.440 --> 1:39:11.440]  But she had a career before she went there
[1:39:11.440 --> 1:39:13.440]  You know, she was a bright bar before she had it
[1:39:13.440 --> 1:39:14.440]  You know, I'm talking about people
[1:39:14.440 --> 1:39:16.440]  That the Blades could have incubated out of nowhere
[1:39:16.440 --> 1:39:18.440]  And turned into media stars
[1:39:18.440 --> 1:39:19.440]  The only one that I can think of
[1:39:19.440 --> 1:39:22.440]  That could have been, you know, a sensation
[1:39:22.440 --> 1:39:25.440]  He has been so rude about
[1:39:25.440 --> 1:39:26.440]  And, you know, just...
[1:39:26.440 --> 1:39:27.440]  And this is a thing
[1:39:27.440 --> 1:39:28.440]  That's because he's jealous
[1:39:28.440 --> 1:39:30.440]  Like, when people are huge
[1:39:30.440 --> 1:39:31.440]  I want them on my show
[1:39:31.440 --> 1:39:32.440]  Because they're interesting
[1:39:32.440 --> 1:39:34.440]  And I want us all to get bigger together
[1:39:34.440 --> 1:39:35.440]  But so many other talk shows
[1:39:35.440 --> 1:39:37.440]  Are violently jealous of everybody else
[1:39:37.440 --> 1:39:38.440]  Of course
[1:39:38.440 --> 1:39:39.440]  And it's so ugly
[1:39:39.440 --> 1:39:40.440]  And it's so petty
[1:39:40.440 --> 1:39:43.440]  And it just makes you look like such a bitch, you know
[1:39:43.440 --> 1:39:44.440]  One good thing about Drudges
[1:39:44.440 --> 1:39:45.440]  He's been a big kingmaker
[1:39:45.440 --> 1:39:47.440]  He's really helped a lot of people
[1:39:47.440 --> 1:39:49.440]  He seems to not be, you know,
[1:39:49.440 --> 1:39:51.440]  Going with the trend of being jealous
[1:39:51.440 --> 1:39:52.440]  No, no, no
[1:39:52.440 --> 1:39:53.440]  And he's perfectly...
[1:39:53.440 --> 1:39:55.440]  You see, he's just got such brilliant
[1:39:55.440 --> 1:39:56.440]  Natural journalistic instincts
[1:39:56.440 --> 1:39:57.440]  He loves characters
[1:39:57.440 --> 1:39:59.440]  And he loves the arc of celebrity
[1:39:59.440 --> 1:40:00.440]  He loves building people up
[1:40:00.440 --> 1:40:01.440]  And then watching them get his trouble
[1:40:01.440 --> 1:40:03.440]  And then getting themselves out of it
[1:40:03.440 --> 1:40:05.440]  Exactly, he gets the real soap opera of life
[1:40:05.440 --> 1:40:06.440]  Of course
[1:40:06.440 --> 1:40:07.440]  And he's kind of the window
[1:40:07.440 --> 1:40:08.440]  Through which he sees the world
[1:40:08.440 --> 1:40:09.440]  He's the perfect tabloid journalist
[1:40:09.440 --> 1:40:10.440]  Because he sees everything
[1:40:10.440 --> 1:40:11.440]  In terms of personality
[1:40:11.440 --> 1:40:12.440]  Who's up, who's down
[1:40:12.440 --> 1:40:13.440]  You know, you get, you know
[1:40:13.440 --> 1:40:14.440]  In the New York Post or whatever
[1:40:14.440 --> 1:40:15.440]  You get the winners of the week
[1:40:15.440 --> 1:40:16.440]  And losers of the week
[1:40:16.440 --> 1:40:17.440]  You know, that's how Drudge operates
[1:40:17.440 --> 1:40:18.440]  And it's fantastic
[1:40:18.440 --> 1:40:19.440]  And it's fascinating
[1:40:19.440 --> 1:40:20.440]  And it's brilliant
[1:40:20.440 --> 1:40:21.440]  And it's how we've come to see politics
[1:40:21.440 --> 1:40:23.440]  It's how we've come to see all sorts of things
[1:40:23.440 --> 1:40:24.440]  You know, he'll...
[1:40:24.440 --> 1:40:25.440]  He's the dominant window
[1:40:25.440 --> 1:40:27.440]  Gestalt of our modern world
[1:40:27.440 --> 1:40:30.440]  And not very keen on Glenn Beck anymore
[1:40:30.440 --> 1:40:31.440]  No
[1:40:31.440 --> 1:40:33.440]  He's very mean about Beck
[1:40:33.440 --> 1:40:35.440]  In all kinds of subtle and delightful ways
[1:40:35.440 --> 1:40:36.440]  Absolutely
[1:40:36.440 --> 1:40:38.440]  Well, you know, expanding on all this
[1:40:38.440 --> 1:40:39.440]  Speaking of the devil
[1:40:39.440 --> 1:40:40.440]  We've got a funder operation
[1:40:40.440 --> 1:40:42.440]  The book's available at M4store.com
[1:40:42.440 --> 1:40:44.440]  Dangerous.com
[1:40:44.440 --> 1:40:48.440]  Not at the flaming Ember...
[1:40:48.440 --> 1:40:50.440]  The blaze, you know
[1:40:50.440 --> 1:40:53.440]  Its end was always prophesied
[1:40:53.440 --> 1:40:54.440]  In its name
[1:40:54.440 --> 1:40:56.440]  You know, it's gonna go down
[1:40:56.440 --> 1:40:58.440]  It's got so many metaphors
[1:40:58.440 --> 1:41:00.440]  The blaze, it burns
[1:41:00.440 --> 1:41:01.440]  Exactly how it started
[1:41:01.440 --> 1:41:03.440]  And exactly how it'll end
[1:41:03.440 --> 1:41:05.440]  It's kind of like naming it Shooting Star
[1:41:05.440 --> 1:41:07.440]  Just the Icarus network
[1:41:07.440 --> 1:41:09.440]  That's why it shows info war
[1:41:09.440 --> 1:41:10.440]  It goes on forever
[1:41:10.440 --> 1:41:11.440]  Of course
[1:41:11.440 --> 1:41:13.440]  And so we're just chronicling that
[1:41:13.440 --> 1:41:14.440]  In an obnoxious way
[1:41:14.440 --> 1:41:16.440]  But seriously, we have the 1776 specials
[1:41:16.440 --> 1:41:18.440]  Of the new specials for the month of August
[1:41:18.440 --> 1:41:20.440]  Keeping with my trend of just discounting
[1:41:20.440 --> 1:41:21.440]  Everything more and more
[1:41:21.440 --> 1:41:22.440]  Because folks love that
[1:41:22.440 --> 1:41:23.440]  Our BrainForce Neutropic
[1:41:23.440 --> 1:41:24.440]  Which I'll be taking today
[1:41:24.440 --> 1:41:25.440]  When I do a two-hour interview
[1:41:25.440 --> 1:41:27.440]  For his show with Milo later
[1:41:27.440 --> 1:41:28.440]  I'm on your brain pills today
[1:41:28.440 --> 1:41:29.440]  Really, you're kidding
[1:41:29.440 --> 1:41:31.440]  No, no, I had them in the brain...
[1:41:31.440 --> 1:41:32.440]  Of the BrainForce pills, yeah
[1:41:32.440 --> 1:41:33.440]  Do they kick in?
[1:41:33.440 --> 1:41:35.440]  I do feel more awake than I was earlier
[1:41:35.440 --> 1:41:37.440]  I'm not gonna lie
[1:41:37.440 --> 1:41:39.440]  I don't know whether it's just your energy
[1:41:39.440 --> 1:41:40.440]  Or the studio lights
[1:41:40.440 --> 1:41:41.440]  Or the BrainForce
[1:41:41.440 --> 1:41:42.440]  But I do feel more lively
[1:41:42.440 --> 1:41:43.440]  Than I did two hours ago
[1:41:43.440 --> 1:41:44.440]  Well BrainForce, well thank you

[1:42:49.440 --> 1:42:50.440]  And we've got on there
[1:42:50.440 --> 1:42:52.440]  As seen on HBO
[1:42:52.440 --> 1:42:54.440]  That's one of the things
[1:42:54.440 --> 1:42:56.440]  I like about you the most
[1:42:56.440 --> 1:42:57.440]  It's one of the things
[1:42:57.440 --> 1:42:58.440]  That we have in common
[1:42:58.440 --> 1:43:00.440]  I've got to tell you, so the beginning of my book
[1:43:00.440 --> 1:43:01.440]  Is all of the mean things
[1:43:01.440 --> 1:43:02.440]  People have said about me
[1:43:02.440 --> 1:43:04.440]  So all the worst things
[1:43:04.440 --> 1:43:05.440]  That people have said about me
[1:43:05.440 --> 1:43:06.440]  But it genuinely entertains me
[1:43:06.440 --> 1:43:07.440]  Oh, it's so fun
[1:43:07.440 --> 1:43:08.440]  They don't realize
[1:43:08.440 --> 1:43:09.440]  They think they're dead
[1:43:09.440 --> 1:43:10.440]  My wife is so sick of my guilty pleasure
[1:43:10.440 --> 1:43:11.440]  I'm like hunting out
[1:43:11.440 --> 1:43:13.440]  The most horrible thing
[1:43:13.440 --> 1:43:14.440]  I didn't say it
[1:43:14.440 --> 1:43:15.440]  The most hated man on the internet
[1:43:15.440 --> 1:43:16.440]  He doesn't have feelings
[1:43:16.440 --> 1:43:17.440]  The ultimate troll
[1:43:17.440 --> 1:43:19.440]  Bullying bleach blonde tantrum starter
[1:43:19.440 --> 1:43:21.440]  Trump troll with daddy issues
[1:43:21.440 --> 1:43:23.440]  Monstrous, trollish, goblin prince
[1:43:25.440 --> 1:43:27.440]  Undignified, cold and low
[1:43:27.440 --> 1:43:29.440]  Polarizing and counterproductive
[1:43:29.440 --> 1:43:30.440]  Doesn't deserve Twitter
[1:43:30.440 --> 1:43:32.440]  Idiot, transphobic, hate monger
[1:43:32.440 --> 1:43:34.440]  An icon of the fringe internet
[1:43:34.440 --> 1:43:36.440]  And then flamboyant homosexual
[1:43:36.440 --> 1:43:37.440]  With movie star good looks
[1:43:37.440 --> 1:43:38.440]  I don't know how that got in there
[1:43:38.440 --> 1:43:41.440]  But what are the things I like about you
[1:43:41.440 --> 1:43:42.440]  And I think it comes from
[1:43:42.440 --> 1:43:44.440]  The self-confidence of knowing that
[1:43:44.440 --> 1:43:45.440]  If they didn't make you
[1:43:45.440 --> 1:43:46.440]  They can't break you
[1:43:46.440 --> 1:43:48.440]  Well, I also like laughing at myself
[1:43:48.440 --> 1:43:50.440]  I mean, I do do goofy stuff
[1:43:50.440 --> 1:43:51.440]  You do do goofy stuff
[1:43:51.440 --> 1:43:52.440]  Although I have to tell you
[1:43:52.440 --> 1:43:53.440]  And we're going to talk about this one
[1:43:53.440 --> 1:43:54.440]  Because I'm going to interview you
[1:43:54.440 --> 1:43:56.440]  After this for my channel
[1:43:56.440 --> 1:43:58.440]  I want to tell you that you have been
[1:43:58.440 --> 1:43:59.440]  Vindicated in a way that
[1:43:59.440 --> 1:44:01.440]  Even I didn't anticipate
[1:44:01.440 --> 1:44:03.440]  There is of course that famous clip
[1:44:03.440 --> 1:44:04.440]  Of you talking about frogs
[1:44:04.440 --> 1:44:05.440]  Yes
[1:44:05.440 --> 1:44:06.440]  Well, the Daily Mail
[1:44:06.440 --> 1:44:07.440]  In the last seven days
[1:44:07.440 --> 1:44:09.440]  Released a story saying that
[1:44:09.440 --> 1:44:11.440]  Chemicals that are going through
[1:44:11.440 --> 1:44:12.440]  Our water system
[1:44:12.440 --> 1:44:14.440]  Partly as a result of contraceptives
[1:44:14.440 --> 1:44:16.440]  Are turning fish transgender
[1:44:16.440 --> 1:44:18.440]  Now technically they've become intersex
[1:44:18.440 --> 1:44:19.440]  So they're not transgender so much as
[1:44:19.440 --> 1:44:20.440]  No gender
[1:44:20.440 --> 1:44:21.440]  But I mean it's
[1:44:21.440 --> 1:44:23.440]  Sort of those laws of the universe
[1:44:23.440 --> 1:44:24.440]  You wait long enough
[1:44:24.440 --> 1:44:25.440]  Alex Jones turns out to be right
[1:44:25.440 --> 1:44:26.440]  Well sure
[1:44:26.440 --> 1:44:28.440]  I mean I was reading articles about it
[1:44:28.440 --> 1:44:29.440]  And then I just made the comment
[1:44:29.440 --> 1:44:30.440]  Like five years ago
[1:44:30.440 --> 1:44:31.440]  Listen, you know
[1:44:31.440 --> 1:44:32.440]  There's always people that are
[1:44:32.440 --> 1:44:34.440]  Naturally you have different sexual
[1:44:34.440 --> 1:44:35.440]  Preferences
[1:44:35.440 --> 1:44:36.440]  I'm saying chemically
[1:44:36.440 --> 1:44:38.440]  It's mainly giving people cancer
[1:44:38.440 --> 1:44:40.440]  But they ignored all that part
[1:44:40.440 --> 1:44:42.440]  And I said the gay frog thing on purpose
[1:44:42.440 --> 1:44:44.440]  Then Howard Stern thought it was funny
[1:44:44.440 --> 1:44:45.440]  It's so funny
[1:44:45.440 --> 1:44:46.440]  But it's like
[1:44:46.440 --> 1:44:47.440]  It's so funny
[1:44:47.440 --> 1:44:48.440]  But it's one of those things that
[1:44:48.440 --> 1:44:49.440]  You know, you have these
[1:44:49.440 --> 1:44:50.440]  You have these moments of
[1:44:50.440 --> 1:44:52.440]  Sort of metaphoric rhetorical
[1:44:52.440 --> 1:44:54.440]  Kind of excess
[1:44:54.440 --> 1:44:55.440]  Well I feed the trolls
[1:44:55.440 --> 1:44:56.440]  I do it on purpose
[1:44:56.440 --> 1:44:57.440]  No I know you do
[1:44:57.440 --> 1:44:58.440]  I know you of course
[1:44:58.440 --> 1:44:59.440]  I know you do
[1:44:59.440 --> 1:45:01.440]  And I will tell these outrageous jokes
[1:45:01.440 --> 1:45:02.440]  And it's like
[1:45:02.440 --> 1:45:03.440]  If you're John Oliver
[1:45:03.440 --> 1:45:04.440]  Or John Stuart
[1:45:04.440 --> 1:45:05.440]  Or Bill Maher
[1:45:05.440 --> 1:45:06.440]  You're allowed to talk about
[1:45:06.440 --> 1:45:07.440]  Current issues
[1:45:07.440 --> 1:45:08.440]  You're allowed to be a journalist
[1:45:08.440 --> 1:45:09.440]  And you're allowed to crack jokes
[1:45:09.440 --> 1:45:10.440]  And be a media personality
[1:45:10.440 --> 1:45:11.440]  Be entertaining
[1:45:11.440 --> 1:45:12.440]  Have like an entertainment news
[1:45:12.440 --> 1:45:14.440]  Magazine kind of show
[1:45:14.440 --> 1:45:15.440]  And it's perfectly fine
[1:45:15.440 --> 1:45:16.440]  But if you're on the right
[1:45:16.440 --> 1:45:18.440]  You're the most jokie bit
[1:45:18.440 --> 1:45:20.440]  Will get thrown back at you
[1:45:20.440 --> 1:45:21.440]  A year later
[1:45:21.440 --> 1:45:22.440]  You know in general
[1:45:22.440 --> 1:45:23.440]  As serious
[1:45:23.440 --> 1:45:24.440]  Well so okay
[1:45:24.440 --> 1:45:26.440]  Now we finish talking about Syria
[1:45:26.440 --> 1:45:28.440]  Do you think the frogs are gay?
[1:45:28.440 --> 1:45:29.440]  And it's
[1:45:29.440 --> 1:45:30.440]  What are you doing?
[1:45:30.440 --> 1:45:31.440]  Like nobody who watched that show
[1:45:31.440 --> 1:45:33.440]  Thinks it's so disingenuous
[1:45:33.440 --> 1:45:34.440]  Well I thought this joke was funny
[1:45:34.440 --> 1:45:36.440]  About you know the other gay frog WB
[1:45:36.440 --> 1:45:37.440]  Hello my baby
[1:45:37.440 --> 1:45:38.440]  Hello my darling
[1:45:38.440 --> 1:45:40.440]  Hello my good time pal
[1:45:40.440 --> 1:45:42.440]  And we're making jokes about all this
[1:45:42.440 --> 1:45:43.440]  It's clearly like
[1:45:43.440 --> 1:45:44.440]  Like here's the headline
[1:45:44.440 --> 1:45:45.440]  Jones believes
[1:45:45.440 --> 1:45:48.440]  Trump's having sex with goblins
[1:45:48.440 --> 1:45:52.440]  And I just like to say the word goblins
[1:45:52.440 --> 1:45:53.440]  It's a good one
[1:45:53.440 --> 1:45:55.440]  And you also like satanic and satan
[1:45:55.440 --> 1:45:56.440]  But you use
[1:45:56.440 --> 1:45:58.440]  I like how you use it
[1:45:58.440 --> 1:46:00.440]  You use it metaphorically sometimes
[1:46:00.440 --> 1:46:02.440]  You know just to mean really really bad
[1:46:02.440 --> 1:46:03.440]  You know
[1:46:03.440 --> 1:46:04.440]  Or I say
[1:46:04.440 --> 1:46:06.440]  I'm wearing my satanic conservative outfit
[1:46:06.440 --> 1:46:08.440]  With a fancy wristwatch
[1:46:08.440 --> 1:46:09.440]  This isn't really fancy
[1:46:09.440 --> 1:46:11.440]  Because you're suggesting that
[1:46:11.440 --> 1:46:12.440]  That's how they see you
[1:46:12.440 --> 1:46:13.440]  Exactly
[1:46:13.440 --> 1:46:14.440]  But then it's misrepresented
[1:46:14.440 --> 1:46:16.440]  As you describing yourself as satanic
[1:46:16.440 --> 1:46:17.440]  Because these people take
[1:46:17.440 --> 1:46:19.440]  You know if it were on the left
[1:46:19.440 --> 1:46:21.440]  Be a perfectly well understood entertainment
[1:46:21.440 --> 1:46:23.440]  You know a blend of entertainment
[1:46:23.440 --> 1:46:24.440]  Social commentary
[1:46:24.440 --> 1:46:25.440]  News and all the rest of it
[1:46:25.440 --> 1:46:26.440]  Which the left is allowed to do
[1:46:26.440 --> 1:46:27.440]  They have dozens of shows
[1:46:27.440 --> 1:46:28.440]  They're on all the networks
[1:46:28.440 --> 1:46:29.440]  You know just go watch any of them
[1:46:29.440 --> 1:46:30.440]  Right they're allowed to do it
[1:46:30.440 --> 1:46:32.440]  They can do silly skits and spoofs
[1:46:32.440 --> 1:46:34.440]  And dress up in silly costumes
[1:46:34.440 --> 1:46:35.440]  And make fun of the news
[1:46:35.440 --> 1:46:36.440]  And then make serious points
[1:46:36.440 --> 1:46:37.440]  And Jones do it of course
[1:46:37.440 --> 1:46:38.440]  Who's the master of this
[1:46:38.440 --> 1:46:40.440]  You know used to retreat into this
[1:46:40.440 --> 1:46:41.440]  I'm just a comedian
[1:46:41.440 --> 1:46:42.440]  Whenever something he said seriously
[1:46:42.440 --> 1:46:44.440]  Got thrown back at him later
[1:46:44.440 --> 1:46:45.440]  And he couldn't stand it up
[1:46:45.440 --> 1:46:46.440]  Or he couldn't justify
[1:46:46.440 --> 1:46:47.440]  He's like oh well I'm just a comedian
[1:46:47.440 --> 1:46:48.440]  I'm on comedy central after all
[1:46:48.440 --> 1:46:50.440]  Yeah but you're probably the most influential
[1:46:50.440 --> 1:46:52.440]  Political commentator of your generation
[1:46:52.440 --> 1:46:53.440]  So give it a rest
[1:46:53.440 --> 1:46:55.440]  You know but it's perfectly allowed
[1:46:55.440 --> 1:46:56.440]  On the left
[1:46:56.440 --> 1:46:57.440]  But if you're on the right
[1:46:57.440 --> 1:46:58.440]  Or even just libertarian
[1:46:58.440 --> 1:47:00.440]  You have to you know
[1:47:00.440 --> 1:47:01.440]  You're held to these
[1:47:01.440 --> 1:47:02.440]  Because again they want to set the rules
[1:47:02.440 --> 1:47:04.440]  And not have competition intellectually
[1:47:04.440 --> 1:47:05.440]  Because they're anti-intellectual
[1:47:05.440 --> 1:47:06.440]  But expanding on that
[1:47:06.440 --> 1:47:08.440]  What about the paradigm of
[1:47:08.440 --> 1:47:09.440]  All their major news shows
[1:47:09.440 --> 1:47:11.440]  Have almost no viewers
[1:47:11.440 --> 1:47:12.440]  They're now cancelling
[1:47:12.440 --> 1:47:14.440]  I think I never even celebrated this week ago
[1:47:14.440 --> 1:47:16.440]  They've cancelled Megan Kelly's show early
[1:47:16.440 --> 1:47:17.440]  I meant to ask you about that
[1:47:17.440 --> 1:47:18.440]  Are you devastated
[1:47:18.440 --> 1:47:20.440]  I'm devastated
[1:47:20.440 --> 1:47:21.440]  But separately
[1:47:21.440 --> 1:47:22.440]  Separately though
[1:47:22.440 --> 1:47:23.440]  Let me bring this up
[1:47:23.440 --> 1:47:24.440]  Because you're an expert
[1:47:24.440 --> 1:47:25.440]  I don't want your take on it
[1:47:25.440 --> 1:47:27.440]  All their top news shows
[1:47:27.440 --> 1:47:28.440]  That still have viewers
[1:47:28.440 --> 1:47:30.440]  Are Colbert and John Oliver
[1:47:30.440 --> 1:47:32.440]  And they do have big audiences
[1:47:32.440 --> 1:47:34.440]  But they're posing as real newsmen
[1:47:34.440 --> 1:47:36.440]  When they have dozens and dozens
[1:47:36.440 --> 1:47:38.440]  Sometimes hundreds of writers
[1:47:38.440 --> 1:47:39.440]  On full time staff
[1:47:39.440 --> 1:47:41.440]  To read off a teleprompter
[1:47:41.440 --> 1:47:42.440]  They have fake laugh tracks
[1:47:42.440 --> 1:47:44.440]  Playing in the background
[1:47:44.440 --> 1:47:45.440]  All of it's fake
[1:47:45.440 --> 1:47:47.440]  And then they pose and say
[1:47:47.440 --> 1:47:48.440]  We're fake news
[1:47:48.440 --> 1:47:49.440]  And then edit things
[1:47:49.440 --> 1:47:50.440]  What does it say about them
[1:47:50.440 --> 1:47:52.440]  That their last bastion
[1:47:52.440 --> 1:47:54.440]  Are comedians
[1:47:54.440 --> 1:47:55.440]  And bad comedians
[1:47:55.440 --> 1:47:58.440]  I think they use it as a sort of therapy
[1:47:58.440 --> 1:48:01.440]  I think they use it as a kind of
[1:48:01.440 --> 1:48:03.440]  As an emotional support mechanism
[1:48:03.440 --> 1:48:04.440]  A ghost dance
[1:48:04.440 --> 1:48:05.440]  Like they're losing
[1:48:05.440 --> 1:48:06.440]  But they can still laugh at us
[1:48:06.440 --> 1:48:07.440]  And as long as they can still be
[1:48:07.440 --> 1:48:09.440]  Sarcastic and snarky
[1:48:09.440 --> 1:48:11.440]  Somehow they can at least keep up the fiction
[1:48:11.440 --> 1:48:12.440]  That they might be in the right
[1:48:12.440 --> 1:48:14.440]  I watched that John Oliver segment
[1:48:14.440 --> 1:48:15.440]  About your show
[1:48:15.440 --> 1:48:17.440]  And he's supposed to be a comedian
[1:48:17.440 --> 1:48:19.440]  Not a single one of his punchlines landed
[1:48:19.440 --> 1:48:20.440]  Not a single
[1:48:20.440 --> 1:48:21.440]  I mean there's just
[1:48:21.440 --> 1:48:22.440]  By the end of it
[1:48:22.440 --> 1:48:23.440]  I was trying to work out something
[1:48:23.440 --> 1:48:24.440]  To ask you about it
[1:48:24.440 --> 1:48:26.440]  And it was so boring
[1:48:26.440 --> 1:48:27.440]  And so rubbish
[1:48:27.440 --> 1:48:28.440]  Compete
[1:48:28.440 --> 1:48:29.440]  I mean look
[1:48:29.440 --> 1:48:31.440]  Neither of us are difficult people
[1:48:31.440 --> 1:48:32.440]  To satirize
[1:48:32.440 --> 1:48:33.440]  Let's be honest
[1:48:33.440 --> 1:48:34.440]  Because we like to have fun
[1:48:34.440 --> 1:48:35.440]  With ourselves
[1:48:35.440 --> 1:48:37.440]  Because we enjoy laughing at ourselves
[1:48:37.440 --> 1:48:38.440]  We're not difficult people to satirize
[1:48:38.440 --> 1:48:39.440]  Yet they can't do it
[1:48:39.440 --> 1:48:41.440]  Because they're such bad comedians
[1:48:41.440 --> 1:48:43.440]  It's not just that their last resort
[1:48:43.440 --> 1:48:44.440]  Is a comedy
[1:48:44.440 --> 1:48:46.440]  Their last resort is to unfunny comedy
[1:48:46.440 --> 1:48:47.440]  It's awful
[1:48:47.440 --> 1:48:48.440]  It just makes me
[1:48:48.440 --> 1:48:49.440]  You know
[1:48:49.440 --> 1:48:51.440]  It just makes me sad
[1:48:51.440 --> 1:48:53.440]  Because America's produced great comedians
[1:48:53.440 --> 1:48:54.440]  Bill Burr, Joan Rivers
[1:48:54.440 --> 1:48:57.440]  And these days it seems like a sort of
[1:48:57.440 --> 1:48:59.440]  Particularly unsatisfying branch
[1:48:59.440 --> 1:49:01.440]  Of leftist activism
[1:49:01.440 --> 1:49:02.440]  Exactly
[1:49:02.440 --> 1:49:03.440]  And they're getting more desperate
[1:49:03.440 --> 1:49:05.440]  As even their big comedy shows
[1:49:05.440 --> 1:49:06.440]  Less and less viewers
[1:49:06.440 --> 1:49:07.440]  I'm tempted to show a tweet
[1:49:07.440 --> 1:49:08.440]  Or not a tweet
[1:49:08.440 --> 1:49:10.440]  A text from Megan Kelly
[1:49:10.440 --> 1:49:12.440]  She's also put some tweets out
[1:49:12.440 --> 1:49:14.440]  The last tweet I sent her
[1:49:14.440 --> 1:49:16.440]  The last
[1:49:16.440 --> 1:49:19.440]  Text I sent her was
[1:49:19.440 --> 1:49:20.440]  I probably shouldn't do it
[1:49:20.440 --> 1:49:21.440]  But the point was
[1:49:21.440 --> 1:49:22.440]  I told her I said
[1:49:22.440 --> 1:49:23.440]  Come on
[1:49:23.440 --> 1:49:24.440]  I said you watch
[1:49:24.440 --> 1:49:25.440]  This is going
[1:49:25.440 --> 1:49:26.440]  I can hear your producer saying do it
[1:49:26.440 --> 1:49:27.440]  Come on do it
[1:49:27.440 --> 1:49:28.440]  Well okay later I'll talk about it
[1:49:28.440 --> 1:49:29.440]  Maybe I gotta pull it up
[1:49:29.440 --> 1:49:30.440]  But the point is
[1:49:30.440 --> 1:49:31.440]  I told her I said
[1:49:31.440 --> 1:49:32.440]  You think you've destroyed me
[1:49:32.440 --> 1:49:34.440]  I said mark my words
[1:49:34.440 --> 1:49:35.440]  You're gonna be burned up by this
[1:49:35.440 --> 1:49:37.440]  And your job's gonna be terminated
[1:49:37.440 --> 1:49:39.440]  And I told her that in person too
[1:49:39.440 --> 1:49:40.440]  We've got the audio
[1:49:40.440 --> 1:49:41.440]  I haven't aired that yet
[1:49:41.440 --> 1:49:42.440]  Rob do pull that audio up
[1:49:42.440 --> 1:49:43.440]  And pull the text up later
[1:49:43.440 --> 1:49:45.440]  And it wasn't an arrogance
[1:49:45.440 --> 1:49:47.440]  I knew that she was gonna edit it
[1:49:47.440 --> 1:49:48.440]  And try to destroy me
[1:49:48.440 --> 1:49:50.440]  And it wasn't that I was that strong
[1:49:50.440 --> 1:49:52.440]  It's that America's totally turned
[1:49:52.440 --> 1:49:53.440]  Against the establishment
[1:49:53.440 --> 1:49:54.440]  And when they built it up
[1:49:54.440 --> 1:49:56.440]  Like David versus Goliath
[1:49:56.440 --> 1:49:57.440]  And that they were the David
[1:49:57.440 --> 1:49:58.440]  Everybody saw her as the Goliath
[1:49:58.440 --> 1:50:00.440]  And I knew that they could have run
[1:50:00.440 --> 1:50:02.440]  A dead dying dog
[1:50:02.440 --> 1:50:03.440]  Up against her
[1:50:03.440 --> 1:50:04.440]  With maggots all over it
[1:50:04.440 --> 1:50:05.440]  And the people would have chosen
[1:50:05.440 --> 1:50:07.440]  The dead dying dog over her
[1:50:07.440 --> 1:50:09.440]  Because they see her as Medusa
[1:50:09.440 --> 1:50:10.440]  And that's my point to them
[1:50:10.440 --> 1:50:11.440]  Is everyone is sick of them
[1:50:11.440 --> 1:50:13.440]  She's also not hugely talented
[1:50:13.440 --> 1:50:14.440]  And I think
[1:50:14.440 --> 1:50:15.440]  She's not exactly
[1:50:15.440 --> 1:50:17.440]  I mean you know she
[1:50:17.440 --> 1:50:19.440]  I think she got a show
[1:50:19.440 --> 1:50:21.440]  Because she was mean to Trump
[1:50:21.440 --> 1:50:22.440]  She got a show
[1:50:22.440 --> 1:50:23.440]  Because she dared to ask
[1:50:23.440 --> 1:50:24.440]  Trump a difficult question
[1:50:24.440 --> 1:50:26.440]  Which he completely bested her on
[1:50:26.440 --> 1:50:27.440]  By the way
[1:50:27.440 --> 1:50:29.440]  You know he completely flattened it
[1:50:29.440 --> 1:50:31.440]  With that amazing only Rosie O'Donnell
[1:50:31.440 --> 1:50:33.440]  Like won the presidency
[1:50:33.440 --> 1:50:34.440]  For me in that moment
[1:50:34.440 --> 1:50:36.440]  You know like I was like
[1:50:36.440 --> 1:50:37.440]  You've called women
[1:50:37.440 --> 1:50:38.440]  Dogs, be you know that
[1:50:38.440 --> 1:50:39.440]  Only Rosie O'Donnell
[1:50:39.440 --> 1:50:40.440]  What's the old talk
[1:50:40.440 --> 1:50:41.440]  Okay done
[1:50:41.440 --> 1:50:42.440]  You're my guy
[1:50:42.440 --> 1:50:43.440]  Stay there
[1:50:43.440 --> 1:50:43.440]  Like I've got the Madame President

[1:50:51.440 --> 1:50:52.440]  I've never seen it

[1:50:53.440 --> 1:50:54.440]  It shows they were trying
[1:50:54.440 --> 1:50:55.440]  To steal the election
[1:50:55.440 --> 1:50:56.440]  Yeah they were sure they were
[1:50:56.440 --> 1:50:57.440]  So here's the blueprint
[1:50:57.440 --> 1:50:58.440]  But you know that's the moment
[1:50:58.440 --> 1:50:59.440]  I knew he definitely won
[1:50:59.440 --> 1:51:01.440]  When I saw that
[1:51:03.440 --> 1:51:04.440]  And the rise

[1:55:51.600 --> 1:55:55.600]  You've started in the Newsweek special with these wonderful pictures of Hillary looking
[1:55:55.600 --> 1:55:59.640]  intense and serious and statesman-like, setting you up for the features.
[1:55:59.640 --> 1:56:03.160]  She was focused for the job of her life, it was her destiny.
[1:56:03.160 --> 1:56:07.520]  She was born to do it, she was born to be America's first female president.
[1:56:07.520 --> 1:56:12.280]  And all these wonderful features that Newsweek prepared before it knew the results of the
[1:56:12.280 --> 1:56:17.280]  election, explaining why she'd won, why Trump had lost, and towards the end of the special
[1:56:17.280 --> 1:56:20.640]  you've got all these things about how, oh, Trump lives in a fantasy world where facts
[1:56:20.640 --> 1:56:23.000]  are irrelevant despite his great claim that he-
[1:56:23.000 --> 1:56:24.240]  And that's why he was defeated.
[1:56:24.240 --> 1:56:25.720]  And that's why he was defeated.
[1:56:25.720 --> 1:56:26.720]  This one, Park Ridge.
[1:56:26.720 --> 1:56:29.680]  He stood against the siren of beauty.
[1:56:29.680 --> 1:56:31.520]  Look at this lovely lifetime special.
[1:56:31.520 --> 1:56:32.520]  Oh there's Bill Clinton.
[1:56:32.520 --> 1:56:34.520]  Park Ridge to Pennsylvania Avenue.
[1:56:34.520 --> 1:56:35.520]  Oh.
[1:56:35.520 --> 1:56:36.520]  And he was commencing-
[1:56:36.520 --> 1:56:40.680]  Oh there she is, the little CIA operative in college.
[1:56:40.680 --> 1:56:43.720]  Loving, loving, leading the ladies.
[1:56:43.720 --> 1:56:50.840]  You know, it's a political dynasty from the beloved rapist in chief, all the way down
[1:56:50.840 --> 1:56:52.720]  to no first housewife.
[1:56:52.720 --> 1:56:54.440]  She's not going to take it lying down.
[1:56:54.440 --> 1:56:55.440]  She's going to get the office.
[1:56:55.440 --> 1:56:57.240]  Oh no, this is her second time in the White House.
[1:56:57.240 --> 1:56:58.240]  She's in charge.
[1:56:58.240 --> 1:56:59.240]  Yes, she's in charge.
[1:56:59.240 --> 1:57:00.240]  Oh, look.
[1:57:00.240 --> 1:57:01.240]  There she is with Al Gore, baby.
[1:57:01.240 --> 1:57:02.240]  Oh, guys, it wasn't-
[1:57:02.240 --> 1:57:05.040]  Her and Tipper are going to get the sack tonight.
[1:57:05.040 --> 1:57:06.040]  Beautiful.
[1:57:06.040 --> 1:57:12.400]  Anyway, it goes on and on, oh look, look, look, Senate and state as her victory, Newsweek
[1:57:12.400 --> 1:57:13.400]  is charting.
[1:57:13.400 --> 1:57:18.040]  It's about her victory after victory, the meteoric rise of the magical queen.
[1:57:18.040 --> 1:57:19.040]  It's inexorable.
[1:57:19.040 --> 1:57:20.040]  Inexorable.
[1:57:20.040 --> 1:57:21.040]  It's unstoppable.
[1:57:21.040 --> 1:57:22.040]  Rise.
[1:57:22.040 --> 1:57:23.040]  Nothing could-
[1:57:23.040 --> 1:57:24.040]  Destiny.
[1:57:24.040 --> 1:57:29.200]  Nothing could possibly have stopped it.
[1:57:29.200 --> 1:57:32.520]  At the state department, and we all know what a great success, what a terrific success
[1:57:32.520 --> 1:57:33.520]  is-
[1:57:33.520 --> 1:57:34.520]  Failed states, Libya, ISIS, al-Qaeda.
[1:57:34.520 --> 1:57:35.520]  Wonderful.
[1:57:35.520 --> 1:57:36.520]  She likes football.
[1:57:36.520 --> 1:57:37.520]  She's a winner.
[1:57:37.520 --> 1:57:39.520]  Oh, and now we get to the really good stuff.
[1:57:39.520 --> 1:57:42.080]  The new war on Hillary, the misogyny.
[1:57:42.080 --> 1:57:45.600]  Oh, they attacked her, but she fought through?
[1:57:45.600 --> 1:57:48.240]  And there she is, looking noble and defiant.
[1:57:48.240 --> 1:57:49.240]  Noble and defiant.
[1:57:49.240 --> 1:57:50.240]  Noble and defiant.
[1:57:50.240 --> 1:57:51.240]  Oh, she's beautiful.
[1:57:51.240 --> 1:57:52.240]  And look-
[1:57:52.240 --> 1:57:56.440]  A lover of the ladies, a descendant.
[1:57:56.440 --> 1:57:57.800]  And she's also her own woman.
[1:57:57.800 --> 1:57:58.800]  Let's not forget.
[1:57:58.800 --> 1:57:59.800]  Letting Hillary be Hillary-
[1:57:59.800 --> 1:58:00.800]  Oh, that's-
[1:58:00.800 --> 1:58:01.800]  She wasn't fake at all.
[1:58:01.800 --> 1:58:07.600]  Merging from her husband's shadow, to be a real convincing and authentic person.
[1:58:07.600 --> 1:58:09.200]  Rolling out of the mouth of hell.
[1:58:09.200 --> 1:58:10.680]  Why have you become Churchill?
[1:58:10.680 --> 1:58:11.680]  Friends with Obama.
[1:58:11.680 --> 1:58:12.680]  Oh, and-
[1:58:12.680 --> 1:58:13.680]  Hold on.
[1:58:13.680 --> 1:58:15.680]  We've got to go to break.
[1:58:15.680 --> 1:58:19.040]  The exciting conclusion in 70 Seconds with Michael Yonopoulos.
[1:58:19.040 --> 1:58:20.040]  We're not done yet.
[1:58:20.040 --> 1:58:23.520]  Ladies and gentlemen, get ready for Newsweek.
[1:58:23.520 --> 1:58:24.520]  They're not fake news.
[1:58:24.520 --> 1:58:28.040]  No Hillary won, and they told you even state-by-state how she won.
[1:58:28.040 --> 1:58:29.040]  That's right.
[1:58:29.040 --> 1:58:31.160]  And it matches just how they tried to steal it that night.
[1:58:31.160 --> 1:58:32.160]  But everything's okay.
[1:58:32.160 --> 1:58:34.080]  Newsweek said, I want to kill liberals.
[1:58:34.080 --> 1:58:35.080]  I never said it.
[1:58:35.080 --> 1:58:36.080]  Does it matter?
[1:58:36.080 --> 1:58:37.400]  That's why they're called fake news.
[1:58:37.400 --> 1:58:38.400]  That's why they're collapsing.
[1:58:38.400 --> 1:58:43.880]  Third hour, straight ahead, spread the word, be part of the revolution, in full wars.

[1:58:50.880 --> 1:58:51.880]  Website.
[1:58:51.880 --> 1:58:52.880]  I-
[1:58:52.880 --> 1:58:56.520]  Today, I'm excited to announce the new limited shipment of DNA forces finally arrived
[1:58:56.520 --> 1:58:58.640]  at the M4's warehouse in Austin, Texas.
[1:58:58.640 --> 1:59:02.760]  We have thousands of listeners on the waiting list who've signed up for auto-ship to receive
[1:59:02.760 --> 1:59:06.560]  out-of-stock products like DNA Force, and we are now once again expected to sell out
[1:59:06.560 --> 1:59:07.560]  very, very soon.
[1:59:07.560 --> 1:59:11.520]  And when it comes to a formula that is such a game-changer like DNA Force, we never know
[1:59:11.520 --> 1:59:15.160]  when we will be able to secure an additional supply of the key ingredients.
[1:59:15.160 --> 1:59:20.360]  The secret behind DNA Force is its powerful lineup of patented ingredients like CoQ-10,
[1:59:20.360 --> 1:59:24.840]  systematic enzymes, NAR-lipolic acid, BioPQQ, and many others.
[1:59:24.840 --> 1:59:30.400]  BioPQQ alone is backed by an unprecedented 175 clinical studies, and just one batch of
[1:59:30.400 --> 1:59:33.360]  this stuff costs us more than $30,000.
[1:59:33.360 --> 1:59:36.040]  Visit m4slife.com and read the reviews for yourself.
[1:59:36.040 --> 1:59:41.640]  Over 700 reviews have given DNA Force an unheard of 4.8 out of 5 stars through our third-party
[1:59:41.640 --> 1:59:44.160]  certified review agency Power Review.
[1:59:44.160 --> 1:59:48.840]  Take advantage of this new limited shipment and get DNA Force today at m4slife.com before
[1:59:48.840 --> 1:59:49.840]  it sells out again.
[1:59:49.840 --> 2:00:11.480]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center, where Milo Unopolis is pouring
[2:00:11.480 --> 2:00:17.920]  over the winner of the 2016 elections, your in a time machine, and Hillary just won.
[2:00:17.920 --> 2:00:36.880]  We are returning from our interdimensional portal to the center spread of the Newsweek
[2:00:36.880 --> 2:00:40.480]  special explaining how Hillary won and why Trump lost.
[2:00:40.480 --> 2:00:41.640]  And this is serious, Hillary.
[2:00:41.640 --> 2:00:42.640]  This is sensible, Hillary.
[2:00:42.640 --> 2:00:43.640]  This is Hillary.
[2:00:43.640 --> 2:00:48.120]  This is work, Hillary, work, Hillary, because this is time for Hillary for play and this
[2:00:48.120 --> 2:00:49.120]  is Hillary for work.
[2:00:49.120 --> 2:00:50.840]  And this is Hillary for work with sensible hair.
[2:00:50.840 --> 2:00:55.480]  She's sitting down and she's working with her predecessor in the Oval Office.
[2:00:55.480 --> 2:00:58.440]  She's getting the job done.
[2:00:58.440 --> 2:01:00.440]  She looks like she's about to accomplish something, doesn't she?
[2:01:00.440 --> 2:01:02.440]  A lot of foreign payments coming into the foundation.
[2:01:02.440 --> 2:01:06.600]  You just raked in a few more billion, put a few more dictators in charge.
[2:01:06.600 --> 2:01:11.640]  This morning I tweeted a rainbow hashtag to my gay followers to pander to them.
[2:01:11.640 --> 2:01:15.640]  On the same morning as I accepted 50 million from Saudi Arabia, how's that?
[2:01:15.640 --> 2:01:17.920]  And Barack, let's out a hearty chuckle.
[2:01:17.920 --> 2:01:20.520]  It's the Democrat Party for you.
[2:01:20.520 --> 2:01:21.520]  Obama's bad cop.
[2:01:21.520 --> 2:01:26.880]  Oh, this is Newsweek setting her up as the tough, the tough one.
[2:01:26.880 --> 2:01:29.680]  Obama needed her to do the hard job and she did it.
[2:01:29.680 --> 2:01:31.080]  She's the tough one in the partnership.
[2:01:31.080 --> 2:01:34.320]  I mean, not difficult with Obama, of course, who has so many things in common with Glenn
[2:01:34.320 --> 2:01:35.320]  Beckers.
[2:01:35.320 --> 2:01:36.320]  We were talking earlier.
[2:01:36.320 --> 2:01:42.440]  Well, I could have been married to a man, as the late Great Joan Rivers revealed to
[2:01:42.440 --> 2:01:43.440]  us all.
[2:01:43.440 --> 2:01:44.440]  You don't talk about that.
[2:01:44.440 --> 2:01:45.440]  Talk about it.
[2:01:45.440 --> 2:01:46.440]  And there she is.
[2:01:46.440 --> 2:01:47.440]  And there she is.
[2:01:47.440 --> 2:01:48.440]  You see the universe.
[2:01:48.440 --> 2:01:49.880]  And again, we're not transphobic.
[2:01:49.880 --> 2:01:51.960]  We're proud that we had the first tranny leader.
[2:01:51.960 --> 2:01:55.480]  No, it shows us as the progressive nation of values that we are.
[2:01:55.480 --> 2:01:56.480]  No.
[2:01:56.480 --> 2:01:59.000]  I'll tell you, though, she is a good-looking tranny.
[2:01:59.000 --> 2:02:02.480]  There's that picture, isn't there, of the in the dress with the lump.
[2:02:02.480 --> 2:02:03.480]  Have you seen that picture?
[2:02:03.480 --> 2:02:04.480]  Yeah, what is that?
[2:02:04.480 --> 2:02:05.480]  Who knows?
[2:02:05.480 --> 2:02:06.480]  Who knows?
[2:02:06.480 --> 2:02:07.480]  It's not.
[2:02:07.480 --> 2:02:08.480]  Is that her sex gun?
[2:02:08.480 --> 2:02:09.480]  Who knows?
[2:02:09.480 --> 2:02:10.480]  Who knows?
[2:02:10.480 --> 2:02:11.480]  Anyway.
[2:02:11.480 --> 2:02:13.240]  Keep your hand on your gun.
[2:02:13.240 --> 2:02:17.160]  So this is her being, this is the approval of the previous...
[2:02:17.160 --> 2:02:20.240]  And she's the lady, Lord Snapping Turtle, that tells our kids what to eat.
[2:02:20.240 --> 2:02:21.240]  That's totally normal.
[2:02:21.240 --> 2:02:24.600]  Do you know how many American school children hate this woman?
[2:02:24.600 --> 2:02:25.600]  And it's wonderful.
[2:02:25.600 --> 2:02:28.240]  It's better than anything any conservative ever did to the reputation of...
[2:02:28.240 --> 2:02:29.240]  Worse than prison food.
[2:02:29.240 --> 2:02:30.960]  No, that's what they say.
[2:02:30.960 --> 2:02:35.360]  You know, I speak, you probably have young fans, too, but I have these people email me
[2:02:35.360 --> 2:02:37.880]  13-year-old girls who say, we don't like the Obamas.
[2:02:37.880 --> 2:02:38.880]  I say, why?
[2:02:38.880 --> 2:02:39.880]  This is school dinners.
[2:02:39.880 --> 2:02:40.880]  They won't let us eat.
[2:02:40.880 --> 2:02:43.360]  We go in in the morning and we get one tiny...
[2:02:43.360 --> 2:02:45.960]  They say that's why suddenly the young kids are all turning against them.
[2:02:45.960 --> 2:02:48.480]  They go, you're the ones that feed us a risen gruel.
[2:02:48.480 --> 2:02:52.200]  We've got this post-millennial conservative generation, and the reason is they weren't
[2:02:52.200 --> 2:02:53.200]  allowed school dinners.
[2:02:53.200 --> 2:02:55.680]  They didn't get sausages and burgers.
[2:02:55.680 --> 2:03:01.560]  They got these tiny bits of green crap, thanks to Michelle Obama, this sort of hectoring,
[2:03:01.560 --> 2:03:02.560]  nanny-ing...
[2:03:02.560 --> 2:03:04.080]  And then the gravy looks like flam.
[2:03:04.080 --> 2:03:05.640]  Oh, okay.
[2:03:05.640 --> 2:03:06.640]  Let's continue to the big victory.
[2:03:06.640 --> 2:03:07.640]  There it is.
[2:03:07.640 --> 2:03:08.640]  And there it is.
[2:03:08.640 --> 2:03:09.640]  Oh.
[2:03:09.640 --> 2:03:10.640]  Look at the beautiful...
[2:03:10.640 --> 2:03:11.640]  Madam President!
[2:03:11.640 --> 2:03:12.840]  It's the moment we've all been waiting for.
[2:03:12.840 --> 2:03:15.320]  It is the inevitable Hillary victory.
[2:03:15.320 --> 2:03:16.960]  You know, by the way, when...
[2:03:16.960 --> 2:03:17.960]  Talk about the Grinch.
[2:03:17.960 --> 2:03:20.880]  Look at how Cain looks like the Grinch that's told Christmas.
[2:03:20.880 --> 2:03:22.520]  He put some green paint on that face.
[2:03:22.520 --> 2:03:24.320]  It's sinister, isn't it?
[2:03:24.320 --> 2:03:25.820]  And just the...
[2:03:25.820 --> 2:03:26.840]  You know what, actually, this is...
[2:03:26.840 --> 2:03:28.840]  He's starring in Stephen King's new hit.
[2:03:28.840 --> 2:03:30.840]  He's the clown.
[2:03:30.840 --> 2:03:31.840]  If you just...
[2:03:31.840 --> 2:03:32.840]  Pennywise.
[2:03:32.840 --> 2:03:37.200]  If you just Google Creepy, Tim Cain, Creepy comes up first.
[2:03:37.200 --> 2:03:42.520]  Tim Cain, space, and the next suggestion, yeah, when they're not censoring Google autocomplete,
[2:03:42.520 --> 2:03:45.360]  as of course they did during the election, to make the results more flattering to Hillary
[2:03:45.360 --> 2:03:46.360]  Hillary.
[2:03:46.360 --> 2:03:47.360]  For Madam President.
[2:03:47.360 --> 2:03:52.440]  It's just an algorithm mistake, of course, you know, just a mistake in the algorithms.
[2:03:52.440 --> 2:03:54.560]  She's a lady, in case you needed to be told.
[2:03:54.560 --> 2:03:57.000]  This is about women's victory right now.
[2:03:57.000 --> 2:03:58.240]  Women's victory, because this is all about...
[2:03:58.240 --> 2:03:59.240]  You're not pandering.
[2:03:59.240 --> 2:04:02.920]  I'm with her, you know, nothing to do with policy or substance.
[2:04:02.920 --> 2:04:07.520]  She has no future, but she's with the mob boss, failed state, ISIS-backing lady that
[2:04:07.520 --> 2:04:10.040]  lied that she was, you know, shot out on a tarmac in Serbia.
[2:04:10.040 --> 2:04:11.040]  Sharing the White House.
[2:04:11.040 --> 2:04:12.040]  There we go.
[2:04:12.040 --> 2:04:14.280]  Oh, now he's going to be the first man.
[2:04:14.280 --> 2:04:15.280]  Back there we go.
[2:04:15.280 --> 2:04:16.760]  Rapist in chief, back in the Oval Office.
[2:04:16.760 --> 2:04:18.760]  Remindings they're rape whistles.
[2:04:18.760 --> 2:04:23.920]  Oh, I saw that for a joke, I was like, why are you advertising what's actually a really
[2:04:23.920 --> 2:04:24.920]  cool product?
[2:04:24.920 --> 2:04:28.280]  Because I was watching that, and I was like, I want one of those, and I'm definitely asking
[2:04:28.280 --> 2:04:29.280]  for one when I go to Austin.
[2:04:29.280 --> 2:04:32.880]  You're going to get one, can we go over to the warehouse and get you a rape whistle?
[2:04:32.880 --> 2:04:33.880]  Please, please.
[2:04:33.880 --> 2:04:36.960]  Get us two, we're going to blow them together, I think they're about to sell out.
[2:04:36.960 --> 2:04:39.560]  I want on-air rape whistles.
[2:04:39.560 --> 2:04:41.880]  Long segment coming up, we have a lot of ads towards the end and starting the hour.
[2:04:41.880 --> 2:04:43.280]  We'll get to the end of the Newsweek special.
[2:04:43.280 --> 2:04:46.640]  We're going to get back into your book, we're going to open the phones up, and then Roger
[2:04:46.640 --> 2:04:48.520]  Stone's joining us with really serious news.
[2:04:48.520 --> 2:04:51.600]  They're isolating the president ahead of a coup, and openly saying they're getting ready
[2:04:51.600 --> 2:04:54.520]  to kill him on national television with Will Plitzer.
[2:04:54.520 --> 2:04:59.200]  So, yeah, I'm just saying hashtag HuntRepublicans, so we're having fun here, but it's pretty
[2:04:59.200 --> 2:05:00.200]  dangerous.
[2:05:00.200 --> 2:05:06.520]  A 44-year-old father was beaten by gang of teenagers and knocked out with a skateboard
[2:05:06.520 --> 2:05:10.280]  after he asked them to stop smoking marijuana on a Dallas train.
[2:05:10.280 --> 2:05:13.800]  The group of teenagers included young men and women who punched the father and threw
[2:05:13.800 --> 2:05:18.760]  him against the train's doors before arriving at the station near Deep Ellum in Dallas, Texas.
[2:05:18.760 --> 2:05:24.440]  In World News, 22.5% of the German population now has a migrant background.
[2:05:24.440 --> 2:05:29.320]  Students and their children make up an estimated 18.6 million people in Germany.
[2:05:29.320 --> 2:05:33.080]  According to the Federal Statistical Office, which attributed the shocking statistic to
[2:05:33.080 --> 2:05:37.560]  German Chancellor Angela Merkel and her open border policies.
[2:05:37.560 --> 2:05:41.680]  In contrast, President Trump plans to overhaul immigration laws in America as part of his
[2:05:41.680 --> 2:05:45.120]  wide-ranging agenda to tighten border security.
[2:05:45.120 --> 2:05:49.480]  The president is working with two senators to draft a bill to create a skills-based immigration
[2:05:49.480 --> 2:05:54.480]  program that gives priority to Americans by cutting down on work visa abuse, among other
[2:05:54.480 --> 2:05:55.480]  things.
[2:05:55.480 --> 2:05:59.720]  For more breaking news and reports, check back at infowars.com throughout the day.
[2:05:59.720 --> 2:06:02.000]  This is Kid Daniels reporting.
[2:06:02.000 --> 2:06:06.360]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years
[2:06:06.360 --> 2:06:11.080]  of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature
[2:06:11.080 --> 2:06:12.600]  to detoxify the body.
[2:06:12.600 --> 2:06:17.480]  That's why I'm introducing Z-Shield, Toxic Metal and Chemical Defense Support.
[2:06:17.480 --> 2:06:22.680]  It's made in the USA, it's filled with known compounds from nature that are absolutely
[2:06:22.680 --> 2:06:25.720]  associated with detoxifying the body and it supports the info war.
[2:06:25.720 --> 2:06:28.000]  It is a classical 360 win.
[2:06:28.000 --> 2:06:32.480]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year and now we believe
[2:06:32.480 --> 2:06:37.160]  we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly
[2:06:37.160 --> 2:06:38.160]  get.
[2:06:38.160 --> 2:06:41.360]  You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family and you owe it to the future of this
[2:06:41.360 --> 2:06:46.400]  country and the world that patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you
[2:06:46.400 --> 2:06:51.640]  can be because we need you, the remnant of America, to reignite those brush fires the
[2:06:51.640 --> 2:06:54.320]  next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be.
[2:06:54.320 --> 2:06:57.640]  Thanks to your support and your prayers together, we're changing the world.
[2:06:57.640 --> 2:07:02.040]  Now it's time to change our bodies with Z-Shield and infowarslife.com.
[2:07:02.040 --> 2:07:05.040]  They use their media to assassinate real news.
[2:07:05.040 --> 2:07:09.240]  They use their schools to teach children that their president is another Hitler.
[2:07:09.240 --> 2:07:13.880]  They use their movie stars and singers and comedy shows and award shows to repeat their
[2:07:13.880 --> 2:07:16.600]  narrative over and over again.
[2:07:16.600 --> 2:07:22.080]  And then they use their ex-president to endorse the resistance, all to make them march, make
[2:07:22.080 --> 2:07:28.880]  them protest, make them scream racism and sexism and xenophobia and homophobia, to smash windows,
[2:07:28.880 --> 2:07:34.440]  burn cars, shut down interstates and airports, bully and terrorize the law-abiding until
[2:07:34.440 --> 2:07:40.520]  the only option left is for the police to do their jobs and stop the madness.
[2:07:40.520 --> 2:07:44.600]  And when that happens, they'll use it as an excuse for their outrage.
[2:07:44.600 --> 2:07:51.200]  The only way we stop this, the only way we save our country and our freedom is to fight
[2:07:51.200 --> 2:07:55.680]  this violence of lies with the clenched fist of truth.
[2:07:55.680 --> 2:08:22.360]  I'm the National Rifle Association of America and I'm Freedom's Safest Place.
[2:08:22.360 --> 2:08:48.480]  I'm the National Rifle Association of America and I'm Freedom's Safest Place.
[2:08:48.480 --> 2:08:57.400]  Now, by the way, we were talking about the rape whistles, and John Oliver did a really
[2:08:57.400 --> 2:09:01.800]  great piece that I want more of, I'm serious, but he goes, rape whistles, why would you
[2:09:01.800 --> 2:09:03.320]  do that with Bill Clinton?
[2:09:03.320 --> 2:09:09.000]  Well, the reason is, is that Bill Clinton had to settle a bunch of rape cases, including
[2:09:09.000 --> 2:09:15.160]  biting women on the face while he raped them, he's well known, but the Newsweek article
[2:09:15.160 --> 2:09:20.880]  says that Trump invented a bunch of fake sex victims of the Clintons.
[2:09:20.880 --> 2:09:26.240]  One of them was a 13-year-old girl kidnapped, raped by seven men until she had a prolapse,
[2:09:26.240 --> 2:09:30.800]  her body came out of her, she could never have kids again, they raped her so hard, Hillary
[2:09:30.800 --> 2:09:34.880]  represented them, admitted they were guilty, and made jokes that we have audio love of
[2:09:34.880 --> 2:09:39.200]  getting them off, so they're obsessed with this, but they make the joke, listen, we took
[2:09:39.200 --> 2:09:43.480]  over Bill Clinton's campaign, Hillary's campaign, blowing whistles, that's why we sold these
[2:09:43.480 --> 2:09:47.480]  at cost, people blew whistles, screaming, you're a rapist, they took over hundreds of
[2:09:47.480 --> 2:09:51.440]  their events, and we probably won the election for Trump, our audience that did that, so
[2:09:51.440 --> 2:09:55.480]  Oliver acts like we're crazy, we're insane, Milo Yiannopoulos is here with us, they don't
[2:09:55.480 --> 2:09:59.120]  know why we did it, he knows full well why well he did it, and we're about to sell out
[2:09:59.120 --> 2:10:02.760]  of these, I'm glad that he reminded us that we had some overstock of these, we need to
[2:10:02.760 --> 2:10:10.080]  bring these back, Bill Clinton's a rapist, Bill Clinton's a rapist, a few times Bill
[2:10:10.080 --> 2:10:13.800]  Clinton would be talking and he'd say, and I'll tell you what that means, that means
[2:10:13.800 --> 2:10:19.080]  you're a rapist, I mean he got torn up, so here's John Oliver looking down his nose at
[2:10:19.080 --> 2:10:24.560]  us, the little chimney sweep, here it is, pick up a Bill Clinton rape whistle, which
[2:10:24.560 --> 2:10:29.160]  according to info wars should be used to let Bill know you're in the crowd and that you
[2:10:29.160 --> 2:10:37.800]  know the truth, that truth by the way, you just spent six dollars on a whistle, oh that's
[2:10:37.800 --> 2:10:43.760]  right, we bought this, and by the way, all the time the 3-9-11 was an inside job bumper
[2:10:43.760 --> 2:10:49.560]  sticker that we most assuredly did not ask, yeah but here's the thing, they say I said
[2:10:49.560 --> 2:10:53.680]  that the government did 9-11, I'm saying criminal elements were Saudi Arabia, I think congressmen
[2:10:53.680 --> 2:10:58.280]  on like Jones confirming it, we're proving right on that again, and in the news today
[2:10:58.280 --> 2:11:02.120]  they are saying that they're admitting they're trying to pass laws to stop appliances from
[2:11:02.120 --> 2:11:05.640]  spying on us, but before we go there Milo, I've been ranting you've got the floor, let's
[2:11:05.640 --> 2:11:08.720]  talk about the rape whistle, let's finish up with the Newsweek Madame President.
[2:11:08.720 --> 2:11:12.560]  I'm very happy to have this, I came in and I saw a mug, and I wanted a mug, and I asked
[2:11:12.560 --> 2:11:15.520]  your producer if I could have a mug, but I have exes, and we'll be exiting the building
[2:11:15.520 --> 2:11:19.400]  with the greatest piece of merchandise I've ever hoped for, so thank you for my whistle.
[2:11:19.400 --> 2:11:23.960]  Right, let's get through to the end of this, because we're on the home stretch, sharing
[2:11:23.960 --> 2:11:26.160]  the White House, there she is, she's on it.
[2:11:26.160 --> 2:11:30.120]  Well I turn back for someone to just join us, she just won, oh she just won, her meteoric
[2:11:30.120 --> 2:11:37.440]  unstoppable rise, Madame President, dum dum dum dum, dum dum dum dum dum dum dum dum.
[2:11:37.440 --> 2:11:41.600]  Here is the red, white and blue, she's dressed for the occasion, she's with her running mate,
[2:11:41.600 --> 2:11:44.440]  everything is perfect and beautiful and celebratory, do you remember that moment by the way on
[2:11:44.440 --> 2:11:45.440]  election night?
[2:11:45.440 --> 2:11:46.440]  Yes, when she won.
[2:11:46.440 --> 2:11:47.440]  You were on air I think, and I was...
[2:11:47.440 --> 2:11:50.800]  Well there it is, it says Madame President, that was the moment she won, they've got
[2:11:50.800 --> 2:11:52.840]  photos of it.
[2:11:52.840 --> 2:11:55.520]  How can it be fake in this picture of it?
[2:11:55.520 --> 2:11:59.240]  This is just one, you know, and the publication of this, I know I said this already, but
[2:11:59.240 --> 2:12:05.720]  the publication of this thing, this object, as soon as I saw this, I knew that he had
[2:12:05.720 --> 2:12:06.720]  won.
[2:12:06.720 --> 2:12:10.080]  I knew that Donald Trump was going to be the next president, because the good Lord above,
[2:12:10.080 --> 2:12:14.360]  the hubris, the hubris of it, the good Lord above would not have allowed this to stand,
[2:12:14.360 --> 2:12:15.360]  you know.
[2:12:15.360 --> 2:12:18.880]  It's like a Titanic going, not even God could sink this ship.
[2:12:18.880 --> 2:12:22.360]  That's exactly what it was, and of course there's only one inevitable rule of history,
[2:12:22.360 --> 2:12:27.200]  you know, that hubris, that grand, and you see it in the great Greek tragedies, you see
[2:12:27.200 --> 2:12:28.600]  it in history time and time again.
[2:12:28.600 --> 2:12:29.600]  Don't tempt the fates.
[2:12:29.600 --> 2:12:35.120]  Don't tempt the fates, and if this isn't tempting the fates, I don't know what is.
[2:12:35.120 --> 2:12:39.680]  So you've got Madame President, the red, white, and blue, beautiful, she's a lady,
[2:12:39.680 --> 2:12:44.400]  she's the winner, she won because she's a woman, not because she was a...
[2:12:44.400 --> 2:12:46.680]  You better get out of the way.
[2:12:46.680 --> 2:12:50.800]  Sharing the White House, there she is, welcoming back in, now I have to, you know, I will break
[2:12:50.800 --> 2:12:53.840]  with possibly you and some of your audience and say that, you know, there's some things
[2:12:53.840 --> 2:12:57.800]  about Bill that were kind of cool, like he was sort of a cool customer, even though,
[2:12:57.800 --> 2:12:58.800]  you know...
[2:12:58.800 --> 2:12:59.800]  He was a rapist and a drug addict.
[2:12:59.800 --> 2:13:02.920]  He was a rapist and a drug addict, and whatever, but he was like an evil Benny Hill.
[2:13:02.920 --> 2:13:06.800]  Putting somebody like that back in the White House was, I mean, well, there it is.
[2:13:06.800 --> 2:13:08.880]  I mean, he already porky-pigged it for eight years.
[2:13:08.880 --> 2:13:10.520]  It's happened, it's happened.
[2:13:10.520 --> 2:13:12.680]  Why would Trump bother to make up rape victims?
[2:13:12.680 --> 2:13:13.680]  You don't need to.
[2:13:13.680 --> 2:13:14.680]  There's dozens of them.
[2:13:14.680 --> 2:13:16.960]  All you've got to do is pick up a newspaper from the 90s.
[2:13:16.960 --> 2:13:20.040]  Okay, so there's all this, oh look, and there's her...
[2:13:20.040 --> 2:13:21.600]  There's the shark attack photo.
[2:13:21.600 --> 2:13:24.000]  Look at the shark attack.
[2:13:24.000 --> 2:13:26.280]  Triumphantly exclaiming.
[2:13:26.280 --> 2:13:29.160]  The demon clown is fighting for us.
[2:13:29.160 --> 2:13:35.000]  Full demon-possessed Linda Blair, prepare for hell.
[2:13:35.000 --> 2:13:37.440]  This was just after the 360 head turn.
[2:13:37.440 --> 2:13:39.440]  Finally, she can finally find the head coming back.
[2:13:39.440 --> 2:13:44.440]  Look at the shot, and she's going to spew green, green, green, green, that's the shot.
[2:13:44.440 --> 2:13:46.440]  The head comes back.
[2:13:46.440 --> 2:13:51.440]  Look, here's the face.
[2:13:51.440 --> 2:13:56.440]  We done?
[2:13:56.440 --> 2:13:57.440]  Good.
[2:13:57.440 --> 2:13:58.440]  Right, sorry.
[2:13:58.440 --> 2:14:01.440]  You can get into it, you see, I love you.
[2:14:01.440 --> 2:14:02.440]  All right, look.
[2:14:02.440 --> 2:14:03.440]  You're pulling his eyes.
[2:14:03.440 --> 2:14:04.440]  I love you.
[2:14:04.440 --> 2:14:05.440]  Try.
[2:14:05.440 --> 2:14:14.560]  After the 360 revolution is complete and immediately before the ejection of the goo, a photographer
[2:14:14.560 --> 2:14:17.160]  manages to catch her head in the forward position.
[2:14:17.160 --> 2:14:19.440]  There it is.
[2:14:19.440 --> 2:14:23.440]  Fighting for us, fighting what nobody knows, what the primaries taught us.
[2:14:23.440 --> 2:14:26.440]  Did she stole it from Marty Sanders and he bent over?
[2:14:26.440 --> 2:14:29.920]  What the primaries taught us is that the Clintons run the Democrat party, but I'm sure that's
[2:14:29.920 --> 2:14:30.920]  not what the article says.
[2:14:30.920 --> 2:14:33.440]  We haven't got time to read the whole thing, but I'm pretty sure Newsweek did.
[2:14:33.440 --> 2:14:38.240]  She won fair and square, battling and remembering the legacy.
[2:14:38.240 --> 2:14:42.080]  Remembering little rock moments from her past, you see, now they've established her victory.
[2:14:42.080 --> 2:14:43.960]  They're giving you a little nostalgic tour.
[2:14:43.960 --> 2:14:47.600]  Again, it's a lifetime movie moment, you know, a little nostalgic tour.
[2:14:47.600 --> 2:14:52.680]  The only endearing thing about her is that she likes women, which is something at least
[2:14:52.680 --> 2:14:53.680]  you can get behind.
[2:14:53.680 --> 2:14:56.560]  And then she's got Webster Hubble's daughter.
[2:14:56.560 --> 2:14:59.600]  The only thing I have in common with her is that we both fuck blacks.
[2:14:59.600 --> 2:15:00.600]  Oh, sorry.
[2:15:00.600 --> 2:15:01.600]  Let's delete that.
[2:15:01.600 --> 2:15:02.600]  Sorry.
[2:15:02.600 --> 2:15:03.600]  Sorry.
[2:15:03.600 --> 2:15:04.600]  We're not allowed to.
[2:15:04.600 --> 2:15:05.600]  I didn't know I was allowed to say that.
[2:15:05.600 --> 2:15:09.360]  Well, she did say blacks are super predators and they got the law passed to put blacks
[2:15:09.360 --> 2:15:13.320]  in jail three times more for the same crime, and then they blamed Trump for it.
[2:15:13.320 --> 2:15:14.320]  No.
[2:15:14.320 --> 2:15:17.200]  Her husband passed the bill that destroyed the black family.
[2:15:17.200 --> 2:15:23.040]  You know, of this constant war on drugs, you know, the crime bill that ripped apart black
[2:15:23.040 --> 2:15:25.880]  families and caused most of the problems in the black community these days.
[2:15:25.880 --> 2:15:27.400]  Oh, a night of firsts.
[2:15:27.400 --> 2:15:28.400]  A night of firsts.
[2:15:28.400 --> 2:15:29.400]  A night of firsts.
[2:15:29.400 --> 2:15:31.280]  They're on the pure goddess outfit.
[2:15:31.280 --> 2:15:32.880]  You know, they're white and pure.
[2:15:32.880 --> 2:15:39.760]  This is the messianic, you know, long lens shot that we've come to know as God save
[2:15:39.760 --> 2:15:41.440]  a queen.
[2:15:41.440 --> 2:15:44.880]  This is actually known in the industry as the Glenbeck, you know, the messianic long
[2:15:44.880 --> 2:15:45.880]  lens.
[2:15:45.880 --> 2:15:46.880]  The Lord.
[2:15:46.880 --> 2:15:47.880]  He's looking down on high.
[2:15:47.880 --> 2:15:52.200]  Just learn to take this person very seriously, very seriously and shot from below to make
[2:15:52.200 --> 2:15:56.360]  them look more substantial and titanic, you know, it's it's called the Glenbeck.
[2:15:56.360 --> 2:15:57.360]  There we go.
[2:15:57.360 --> 2:15:58.360]  And we've got all looking.
[2:15:58.360 --> 2:15:59.360]  There's her.
[2:15:59.360 --> 2:16:00.360]  There's Webster Hubble.
[2:16:00.360 --> 2:16:05.520]  There's there's Mr. Ed leading through to get a bottle, a bucket of grain, a horse is
[2:16:05.520 --> 2:16:06.520]  a horse.
[2:16:06.520 --> 2:16:07.520]  Of course.
[2:16:07.520 --> 2:16:08.520]  Of course.
[2:16:08.520 --> 2:16:09.520]  That is, of course.
[2:16:09.520 --> 2:16:11.080]  Unless the horse is the famous Webster Hubble.
[2:16:11.080 --> 2:16:14.920]  Well, is that on look?
[2:16:14.920 --> 2:16:15.920]  There's Bill.
[2:16:15.920 --> 2:16:16.760]  Lovely.
[2:16:16.760 --> 2:16:17.760]  Okay.
[2:16:17.760 --> 2:16:18.760]  On the table.
[2:16:18.760 --> 2:16:21.840]  I have no comment to make about that.
[2:16:21.840 --> 2:16:25.880]  You know, there were moments when you kind of got the, you know, this is that a lobster
[2:16:25.880 --> 2:16:26.880]  ring?
[2:16:26.880 --> 2:16:27.880]  No.
[2:16:27.880 --> 2:16:28.880]  It's a scorpion.
[2:16:28.880 --> 2:16:29.880]  It's a scorpion.
[2:16:29.880 --> 2:16:30.880]  You like it?
[2:16:30.880 --> 2:16:31.880]  I do.
[2:16:31.880 --> 2:16:32.880]  Yeah.
[2:16:32.880 --> 2:16:33.880]  I like it more.
[2:16:33.880 --> 2:16:34.880]  It was a lobster.
[2:16:34.880 --> 2:16:35.880]  Why?
[2:16:35.880 --> 2:16:36.880]  Scorpions are cool on lobsters, aren't they?
[2:16:36.880 --> 2:16:37.880]  Lobsters are just tasty.
[2:16:37.880 --> 2:16:38.880]  Scorpions are dangerous.
[2:16:38.880 --> 2:16:39.880]  Lobsters are psychic.
[2:16:39.880 --> 2:16:40.880]  Yeah.
[2:16:40.880 --> 2:16:41.880]  I've got I've got a dragon.
[2:16:41.880 --> 2:16:42.880]  I've got a snake and I've got a scorpion because they're dangerous.
[2:16:42.880 --> 2:16:43.880]  I understand.
[2:16:43.880 --> 2:16:44.880]  Lobsters aren't very dangerous.
[2:16:44.880 --> 2:16:45.880]  I'm sorry.
[2:16:45.880 --> 2:16:46.880]  They're a little nip.
[2:16:46.880 --> 2:16:51.520]  Again, we're doing a review of the fake news report, but the real report is Dangerous,
[2:16:51.520 --> 2:16:53.680]  the new best-selling book, which was banned.
[2:16:53.680 --> 2:16:54.680]  You can't make that up.
[2:16:54.680 --> 2:16:58.000]  But back from the dead, published by Milo Yiannopoulos, available at m4warstore.com.
[2:16:58.000 --> 2:16:59.000]  What is it?
[2:16:59.000 --> 2:17:02.680]  Well, that's a beautiful, more beautiful photos, newsweek's really getting into it
[2:17:02.680 --> 2:17:03.680]  now.
[2:17:03.680 --> 2:17:06.760]  And then, of course, what we've all been waiting for, the moment that we've been waiting for,
[2:17:06.760 --> 2:17:10.400]  which is when they explain how and why she beat the Donalds.
[2:17:10.400 --> 2:17:11.400]  This is really rich.
[2:17:11.400 --> 2:17:16.480]  And they've got the state breakdowns and, oh my gosh, and how he got caught lying about
[2:17:16.480 --> 2:17:17.640]  Bill being a rapist.
[2:17:17.640 --> 2:17:18.640]  Oh, look.
[2:17:18.640 --> 2:17:23.160]  This is this is Bill Clinton is not a rapist, Bill Clinton, not a rapist, apparently.
[2:17:23.160 --> 2:17:28.520]  Of course, we have whistles, so we know that what did I do wrong there?
[2:17:28.520 --> 2:17:29.520]  You think I'd be better.
[2:17:29.520 --> 2:17:30.520]  No, I'm selling defective ones.
[2:17:30.520 --> 2:17:31.520]  No, no, no.
[2:17:31.520 --> 2:17:32.520]  They're good whistles.
[2:17:32.520 --> 2:17:33.520]  You think I'd be better.
[2:17:33.520 --> 2:17:34.520]  Blow harder.
[2:17:34.520 --> 2:17:35.520]  I'd be better at blowing.
[2:17:35.520 --> 2:17:36.520]  There we go.
[2:17:36.520 --> 2:17:37.520]  Right.
[2:17:37.520 --> 2:17:44.720]  I'm waiting Donalds, so this is the piece-by-piece deconstruction analysis of postgame.
[2:17:44.720 --> 2:17:49.680]  Postgame analysis is a deconstruction of just how badly wrong he got the debates, the debates
[2:17:49.680 --> 2:17:50.680]  they've got.
[2:17:50.680 --> 2:17:51.680]  And there she is.
[2:17:51.680 --> 2:17:55.160]  There she is, calmly explaining while he looms over her in a sinister, wasn't that great
[2:17:55.160 --> 2:17:58.280]  with him prowling behind her like a, like a, like a predator.
[2:17:58.280 --> 2:18:04.120]  He was like a lion, you know, just prowling around, just waiting to strike, you know,
[2:18:04.120 --> 2:18:05.120]  you're a lion.
[2:18:05.120 --> 2:18:08.440]  And you'd be in jail.
[2:18:08.440 --> 2:18:09.440]  You'd be in jail.
[2:18:09.440 --> 2:18:11.240]  Oh my goodness.
[2:18:11.240 --> 2:18:12.240]  Just wonderful.
[2:18:12.240 --> 2:18:14.480]  There she is, sort of calmly and reasonably explaining-
[2:18:14.480 --> 2:18:15.920]  Do you have a crush on Trump?
[2:18:15.920 --> 2:18:16.920]  Yeah, of course.
[2:18:16.920 --> 2:18:17.920]  Of course.
[2:18:17.920 --> 2:18:22.000]  I told the New York Times I was Trump sexual, and I didn't think they'd print it, but they
[2:18:22.000 --> 2:18:23.000]  did.
[2:18:23.000 --> 2:18:24.000]  The back of the-
[2:18:24.000 --> 2:18:28.080]  Do you like golden toads?
[2:18:28.080 --> 2:18:29.160]  What is a golden toad?
[2:18:29.160 --> 2:18:30.160]  That's Donald Trump.
[2:18:30.160 --> 2:18:31.160]  Golden toad?
[2:18:31.160 --> 2:18:32.320]  His spirit animal's a golden toad.
[2:18:32.320 --> 2:18:33.320]  He doesn't look like it.
[2:18:33.320 --> 2:18:34.320]  No, no.
[2:18:34.320 --> 2:18:37.680]  Well, see, when I look at him, I don't see any particular physical features.
[2:18:37.680 --> 2:18:40.320]  It's more an impression of greatness, you know.
[2:18:40.320 --> 2:18:41.320]  Stafely power.
[2:18:41.320 --> 2:18:44.400]  No, of strength, of masculinity, of confidence.
[2:18:44.400 --> 2:18:45.400]  Of will.
[2:18:45.400 --> 2:18:46.400]  Of will.
[2:18:46.400 --> 2:18:50.960]  Literally, the will to power, you know, somebody who willed his way to the presidency, who
[2:18:50.960 --> 2:18:55.640]  just by sheer force of personality and will now occupies the Oval Office.
[2:18:55.640 --> 2:18:56.640]  Is there anything hotter than that?
[2:18:56.640 --> 2:18:57.640]  That's right.
[2:18:57.640 --> 2:18:58.640]  Let's skip this one break.
[2:18:58.640 --> 2:18:59.640]  Go ahead.
[2:18:59.640 --> 2:19:00.640]  Anything hotter than that?
[2:19:00.640 --> 2:19:01.640]  I don't think there is.
[2:19:01.640 --> 2:19:02.640]  Well, I mean, I think the fact that he's actually from knowing folks that know him
[2:19:02.640 --> 2:19:06.680]  in the White House and more, he really is trying to do what's best for prosperity for
[2:19:06.680 --> 2:19:08.680]  the people, for two-way streets on trade.
[2:19:08.680 --> 2:19:12.840]  I mean, he's just trying to be fair and not have it out to get America that the globalist
[2:19:12.840 --> 2:19:15.280]  and the leftist want to mount America's head on the wall.
[2:19:15.280 --> 2:19:18.660]  I mean, they fundamentally want to dominate America.
[2:19:18.660 --> 2:19:20.960]  I just think he's wonderful.
[2:19:20.960 --> 2:19:22.280]  But you're right.
[2:19:22.280 --> 2:19:24.240]  And there she is.
[2:19:24.240 --> 2:19:25.240]  Look, look, look, look, look.
[2:19:25.240 --> 2:19:29.480]  See, this is a triumphant post-debate picture where she's posing as though she's already
[2:19:29.480 --> 2:19:30.480]  one.
[2:19:30.480 --> 2:19:35.600]  But do you think, do you think that the Democrat campaign was spending so much time staging
[2:19:35.600 --> 2:19:38.840]  the victory pictures, working with Newsweek to have nice photos of her?
[2:19:38.840 --> 2:19:42.240]  Yes, they were too busy laughing and celebrating how they were invincible because they just
[2:19:42.240 --> 2:19:43.240]  stole the nomination.
[2:19:43.240 --> 2:19:44.240]  They knew Trump was going to win.
[2:19:44.240 --> 2:19:45.240]  They were going to steal it.
[2:19:45.240 --> 2:19:48.520]  They forgot to actually fight the election, or they thought they didn't need to.
[2:19:48.520 --> 2:19:51.960]  So they were spending all their time working with Newsweek on photos like this because
[2:19:51.960 --> 2:19:52.960]  this was at the debate.
[2:19:52.960 --> 2:19:54.220]  You know, this, this was set up.
[2:19:54.220 --> 2:19:58.640]  And now they're spending all their time exactly trying to convince us that the Russians stole
[2:19:58.640 --> 2:19:59.640]  the election.
[2:19:59.640 --> 2:20:03.360]  Oh, well, there's a name for this in psychology, which escapes me for the moment.
[2:20:03.360 --> 2:20:06.280]  But it's, you know, when you, when you put all of the world's ills, you're looking for
[2:20:06.280 --> 2:20:09.240]  a bad actor to explain to the world's ills, ills, right?
[2:20:09.240 --> 2:20:13.040]  Well, feminism does it with the patriarchy, you know, Black Lives Matter does it with
[2:20:13.040 --> 2:20:14.040]  white people.
[2:20:14.040 --> 2:20:15.040]  It's a boogeyman.
[2:20:15.040 --> 2:20:16.040]  I mean, Hitler did it with the Jews.
[2:20:16.040 --> 2:20:17.040]  Right.
[2:20:17.040 --> 2:20:21.720]  And the Democrat Party, the Democrat Party unable or unwilling to examine its own failings,
[2:20:21.720 --> 2:20:26.280]  its own arrogance, its own lack of ability to accomplish anything, and its own structural
[2:20:26.280 --> 2:20:27.280]  weakness.
[2:20:27.280 --> 2:20:30.520]  You know, Pelosi, and I've had grandparents that got old and got seen now, I'm not making
[2:20:30.520 --> 2:20:35.160]  fun of it, but she's in power, stumbling around looking like a Botox Barbie doll, going
[2:20:35.160 --> 2:20:37.920]  George W is in Hawaii.
[2:20:37.920 --> 2:20:38.920]  Where is that?
[2:20:38.920 --> 2:20:43.680]  And then, and then you've got Maxine Waters going to Putin with Trump.
[2:20:43.680 --> 2:20:44.680]  They attack Korea.
[2:20:44.680 --> 2:20:46.400]  What do I mean?
[2:20:46.400 --> 2:20:47.400]  It's like what planet?
[2:20:47.400 --> 2:20:52.520]  The one that gets me, the one that is like through the embodiment of sheer evil is Debbie
[2:20:52.520 --> 2:20:53.520]  Wasserman Schultz.
[2:20:53.520 --> 2:20:54.520]  Now, if you've ever-
[2:20:54.520 --> 2:20:57.520]  Look at the head cops who've got the laptops and the guys are playing in the country.
[2:20:57.520 --> 2:20:59.120]  You're in a lot of trouble, man.
[2:20:59.120 --> 2:21:00.120]  Yeah.
[2:21:00.120 --> 2:21:01.120]  And you know what it is, if you-
[2:21:01.120 --> 2:21:02.120]  She even says you're a racist, too.
[2:21:02.120 --> 2:21:04.120]  It's a white woman to a white cop.
[2:21:04.120 --> 2:21:05.120]  You're a racist.
[2:21:05.120 --> 2:21:06.120]  Ow!
[2:21:06.120 --> 2:21:07.120]  I don't know.
[2:21:07.120 --> 2:21:08.120]  Just randomly.
[2:21:08.120 --> 2:21:09.120]  You better not let us out.
[2:21:09.120 --> 2:21:10.120]  You better not-
[2:21:10.120 --> 2:21:11.120]  Isn't this lovely?
[2:21:11.120 --> 2:21:12.120]  Look at this.
[2:21:12.120 --> 2:21:13.120]  Look at this.
[2:21:13.120 --> 2:21:14.120]  It's beautiful.
[2:21:14.120 --> 2:21:15.120]  A worshiper.
[2:21:15.120 --> 2:21:16.120]  Here.
[2:21:16.120 --> 2:21:17.120]  Why you talking about it?
[2:21:17.120 --> 2:21:18.120]  I'm going to bow down right now.
[2:21:18.120 --> 2:21:19.120]  Go ahead.
[2:21:19.120 --> 2:21:25.320]  I was just going to say, there's- I'll let you-
[2:21:25.320 --> 2:21:26.320]  Don't you do it!
[2:21:26.320 --> 2:21:27.320]  No, okay.
[2:21:27.320 --> 2:21:28.320]  All right.
[2:21:28.320 --> 2:21:29.320]  Fine.
[2:21:29.320 --> 2:21:30.320]  No, there-
[2:21:30.320 --> 2:21:31.640]  I forgot what I was going to say.
[2:21:31.640 --> 2:21:32.640]  It's got-
[2:21:32.640 --> 2:21:33.640]  Oh, no, no, wait.
[2:21:33.640 --> 2:21:38.720]  If you've ever read The Twits by Roald Dahl, there's a moment at the beginning of the
[2:21:38.720 --> 2:21:43.920]  book where he's explaining how even if you are physically conventionally unattractive,
[2:21:43.920 --> 2:21:48.600]  if you have like, you know, wonky eyes and bad teeth and all the rest of it, if you have
[2:21:48.600 --> 2:21:51.320]  a good heart and a good soul, it will shine through you and you'll always somehow look
[2:21:51.320 --> 2:21:52.320]  beautiful.
[2:21:52.320 --> 2:21:53.880]  You'll always radiate the goodness that's within you.
[2:21:53.880 --> 2:21:57.320]  And then he turns to talk about his lead two characters, Mr. and Mrs. Twit, and he says,
[2:21:57.320 --> 2:22:00.040]  if you're evil, if you're wicked, if you have nothing but dark thoughts-
[2:22:00.040 --> 2:22:01.040]  Are you killing?
[2:22:01.040 --> 2:22:02.040]  It will-
[2:22:02.040 --> 2:22:03.040]  Stop it.
[2:22:03.040 --> 2:22:08.400]  It will show on the face and you'll start to, you know, and over the years it gradually
[2:22:08.400 --> 2:22:09.400]  becomes-
[2:22:09.400 --> 2:22:10.400]  The portrait of Darian Gray.
[2:22:10.400 --> 2:22:13.000]  Well, yeah, it's something of the same principle.
[2:22:13.000 --> 2:22:14.960]  That's Debbie Wasserman Schultz.
[2:22:14.960 --> 2:22:17.560]  You know, you can sort of see the darkness within her.
[2:22:17.560 --> 2:22:20.040]  Oh, she looks like the Joker or something.
[2:22:20.040 --> 2:22:24.920]  She looks totally like a bug-eyed shitsue dog on PCP.
[2:22:24.920 --> 2:22:27.360]  That's your description.
[2:22:27.360 --> 2:22:29.200]  But yeah, and here we go.
[2:22:29.200 --> 2:22:34.840]  There's more harkening back to her heroic and triumphant victory on the stage with Donald
[2:22:34.840 --> 2:22:35.840]  Trump.
[2:22:35.840 --> 2:22:38.720]  And now look, oh, look, look, look, look, look, the comedians.
[2:22:38.720 --> 2:22:44.320]  This is the entertainment industry united in their love and adulation for the candidate.
[2:22:44.320 --> 2:22:45.240]  Everybody was behind her.
[2:22:45.240 --> 2:22:50.240]  The whole country loved her in the face of this sexist, misogynist, white supremacist
[2:22:50.240 --> 2:22:54.680]  monster that she was running against that actually was none of those things.
[2:22:54.680 --> 2:22:55.680]  Exactly.
[2:22:55.680 --> 2:22:59.120]  My buddy Shane Stoner said you posted on Facebook asking about good restaurants and people were
[2:22:59.120 --> 2:23:00.120]  giving you bad advice.
[2:23:00.120 --> 2:23:03.120]  He says the Stoner steakhouse will buy you a steak if you come in there.
[2:23:03.120 --> 2:23:04.120]  Oh, well, thank you very much.
[2:23:04.120 --> 2:23:06.760]  It's a great steakhouse, but it's out by the lake if you're ever out here.
[2:23:06.760 --> 2:23:07.760]  Really nice lake.
[2:23:07.760 --> 2:23:10.520]  If I ever come back with more time, then I will be-
[2:23:10.520 --> 2:23:11.520]  Absolutely.
[2:23:11.520 --> 2:23:12.520]  But I can tell you about some good places downtown.
[2:23:12.520 --> 2:23:13.520]  Thank you so much.
[2:23:13.520 --> 2:23:17.120]  I'm going to pull up the Megyn Kelly text and I'm going to actually show you what I said
[2:23:17.120 --> 2:23:18.120]  to her.
[2:23:18.120 --> 2:23:19.120]  Oh, good.
[2:23:19.120 --> 2:23:20.120]  Well, let me get to the end of this while you're doing that.
[2:23:20.120 --> 2:23:21.120]  So there we go.
[2:23:21.120 --> 2:23:22.840]  There's her victorious farewell goodbye.
[2:23:22.840 --> 2:23:23.840]  She's wonderful.
[2:23:23.840 --> 2:23:29.440]  Newsweek, oh, Newsweek, by the way, inserts an ad for itself claiming that it can explain
[2:23:29.440 --> 2:23:30.440]  the Bible.
[2:23:30.440 --> 2:23:31.440]  The Bible.
[2:23:31.440 --> 2:23:33.040]  So misunderstood, it's a sin.
[2:23:33.040 --> 2:23:34.840]  So misunderstood, it's a sin.
[2:23:34.840 --> 2:23:42.160]  Newsweek says about its own coverage of the Bible in the pages of this, and then we all
[2:23:42.160 --> 2:23:45.440]  know what that's like, and you say, oh, and here, and you know, it's always interesting
[2:23:45.440 --> 2:23:49.600]  the headlines that get picked by friendly media, and it's like, if you have to say it, you
[2:23:49.600 --> 2:23:50.600]  know?
[2:23:50.600 --> 2:23:51.600]  It's like, Hillary the human.
[2:23:51.600 --> 2:23:53.600]  Well, I mean, if you've got to say it-
[2:23:53.600 --> 2:23:54.600]  Exactly.
[2:23:54.600 --> 2:23:56.800]  This is the moments when you're like-
[2:23:56.800 --> 2:24:03.320]  Because remember Joe Biden went, I know she's a robot and you hate her, but she's big office.
[2:24:03.320 --> 2:24:08.640]  Hillary the human, like, okay, all right, fine, if you insist, and there, of course-
[2:24:08.640 --> 2:24:11.640]  She's looking at some little black kid she wants to put in prison.
[2:24:11.640 --> 2:24:13.840]  That's what I meant by my joke.
[2:24:13.840 --> 2:24:15.200]  She's like, look at these super predators.
[2:24:15.200 --> 2:24:16.400]  Sorry for the language earlier.
[2:24:16.400 --> 2:24:18.160]  That's what I was getting at with my joke earlier.
[2:24:18.160 --> 2:24:21.520]  As long as we're able to delay it for our radio stations, we have to delete it out,
[2:24:21.520 --> 2:24:22.520]  but it's fine.
[2:24:22.520 --> 2:24:23.520]  Sorry about that.
[2:24:23.520 --> 2:24:24.520]  Sorry about that.
[2:24:24.520 --> 2:24:25.520]  Oh, and then we have Queen Makers.
[2:24:25.520 --> 2:24:26.520]  Queen Makers, wonderful.
[2:24:26.520 --> 2:24:29.160]  And it's a little message like here she is with her girlfriend.
[2:24:29.160 --> 2:24:30.160]  Well, maybe.
[2:24:30.160 --> 2:24:33.160]  I mean, Queen, you know, there's a little, there's a little, there's a little subtext.
[2:24:33.160 --> 2:24:34.160]  Subtext.
[2:24:34.160 --> 2:24:35.960]  It's a little Islamic, juicy.
[2:24:35.960 --> 2:24:39.320]  This is a mischievous sub-editor at Newsweek.
[2:24:39.320 --> 2:24:41.960]  But listen, Uma Abadi's mother promotes gentle mutilation of women.
[2:24:41.960 --> 2:24:43.480]  She's a big Islamic scholar on it.
[2:24:43.480 --> 2:24:44.480]  Oh, she has.
[2:24:44.480 --> 2:24:47.680]  I wonder if, when Hillary's, you know, hanging out with Uma, if there's even any business
[2:24:47.680 --> 2:24:48.680]  down there.
[2:24:48.680 --> 2:24:51.520]  If there's anything left, or maybe that's what they're into.
[2:24:51.520 --> 2:24:53.040]  Maybe they have cheese graters.
[2:24:53.040 --> 2:24:55.240]  I'm not trying, I mean, it's great.
[2:24:55.240 --> 2:24:57.040]  The Muslims are doing this, folks.
[2:24:57.040 --> 2:25:00.840]  We're not the ones, they'll say, they make jokes about gentle mutilation, but they won't
[2:25:00.840 --> 2:25:03.400]  even say it's the Muslims doing it, and that we're against it.
[2:25:03.400 --> 2:25:05.120]  No, it's like, okay, I'm a gay man.
[2:25:05.120 --> 2:25:08.840]  I can't make jokes about Muslims who want me dead and are killing other gay people.
[2:25:08.840 --> 2:25:09.840]  No, you're not allowed to.
[2:25:09.840 --> 2:25:12.880]  No, I'm the hateful one for making jokes about it on TV.
[2:25:12.880 --> 2:25:16.040]  Why is the left, though, in love with the most radical forms of Islam that are like
[2:25:16.040 --> 2:25:17.520]  foam at the mouth psychopaths?
[2:25:17.520 --> 2:25:20.840]  Oh, because Islam hates the West just as much as they do.
[2:25:20.840 --> 2:25:23.960]  They see it as the most effective route to tear down all the institutions they hate so
[2:25:23.960 --> 2:25:24.960]  much.
[2:25:24.960 --> 2:25:29.760]  Like, you know, and all of the principles and the motivating forces behind the country
[2:25:29.760 --> 2:25:33.800]  they hate so much, freedom and democracy and liberty, all of these things are profoundly
[2:25:33.800 --> 2:25:36.400]  antithetical to radical Islam, to Islam in general, frankly.
[2:25:36.400 --> 2:25:39.280]  I want you to look in that camera then, and in a few minutes before we go to break, we're
[2:25:39.280 --> 2:25:42.360]  come back and take calls, get into all the other topics you want to cover, as we've been
[2:25:42.360 --> 2:25:45.200]  analyzing the gatekeepers of reality.
[2:25:45.200 --> 2:25:48.160]  Oh, look at the final picture, her and Joe Biden.
[2:25:48.160 --> 2:25:53.360]  My final thing, this is the smug final conclusion to the...
[2:25:53.360 --> 2:25:55.640]  We're in charge, we're running things.
[2:25:55.640 --> 2:26:00.840]  And there she is, back in her presidential outfit, she's in her sober blue with the flags
[2:26:00.840 --> 2:26:02.560]  behind her, surrounded by stuff.
[2:26:02.560 --> 2:26:05.040]  With Joe Biden, you had good positive numbers with Democrats.
[2:26:05.040 --> 2:26:10.800]  Joe Biden, she's back in her pearls, she's looking presidential and she's ready to get
[2:26:10.800 --> 2:26:11.800]  to work.
[2:26:11.800 --> 2:26:17.440]  And wouldn't it have been wonderful if that glorious, sunny, democratic future had come
[2:26:17.440 --> 2:26:18.440]  to pass.
[2:26:18.440 --> 2:26:22.640]  And there's one final big, big centerfold right there of the victory, the night cheese,
[2:26:22.640 --> 2:26:23.640]  the victory.
[2:26:23.640 --> 2:26:24.640]  There's photos of it.
[2:26:24.640 --> 2:26:29.560]  And what they do, this is a photo from the DNC, and they're including it in here, making
[2:26:29.560 --> 2:26:32.440]  it look like it's the election night victory photo.
[2:26:32.440 --> 2:26:35.920]  This is just after her speech in a room full of people who, of course, already love her,
[2:26:35.920 --> 2:26:36.920]  most of whom are paid to be.
[2:26:36.920 --> 2:26:39.440]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[2:26:39.440 --> 2:26:40.440]  Look at Bill right here.
[2:26:40.440 --> 2:26:41.840]  I mean, talk about Day of the Dead.
[2:26:41.840 --> 2:26:46.360]  But do you remember all those wonderful pictures of him where people, like, photographers
[2:26:46.360 --> 2:26:49.600]  would catch him at certain moments, and you could sort of read on his face like one of
[2:26:49.600 --> 2:26:52.040]  a done, like, don't do it, don't do it, this woman, win.
[2:26:52.040 --> 2:26:55.760]  You know, it's almost like, you could sort of almost read some sort of Stockholm syndrome
[2:26:55.760 --> 2:26:56.760]  on the face.
[2:26:56.760 --> 2:26:58.640]  And it's like, no, don't do this, America.
[2:26:58.640 --> 2:27:00.800]  Well, you know the two hate each other.
[2:27:00.800 --> 2:27:01.800]  Well...
[2:27:01.800 --> 2:27:04.080]  I don't know if she had to get Webster in to impregnate her.
[2:27:04.080 --> 2:27:06.320]  I don't know anything about that.
[2:27:06.320 --> 2:27:08.520]  No, no, no, seriously, Bill is literally her beard.
[2:27:08.520 --> 2:27:09.520]  You didn't know that?
[2:27:09.520 --> 2:27:10.520]  I mean, look...
[2:27:10.520 --> 2:27:11.600]  It's nothing against her.
[2:27:11.600 --> 2:27:12.600]  She likes women.
[2:27:12.600 --> 2:27:13.600]  No, we're progressive.
[2:27:13.600 --> 2:27:16.120]  We're for progressive America.
[2:27:16.120 --> 2:27:17.640]  We have no problem whatsoever with this.
[2:27:17.640 --> 2:27:18.640]  But we're being homophobic.
[2:27:18.640 --> 2:27:23.120]  We establish this with Michelle Obama that we're a very progressive, we have a very progressive
[2:27:23.120 --> 2:27:24.120]  vision for the United States.
[2:27:24.120 --> 2:27:27.520]  Seriously, Michelle Obama does look like a man.
[2:27:27.520 --> 2:27:28.520]  Yeah.
[2:27:28.520 --> 2:27:29.520]  Yeah.
[2:27:29.520 --> 2:27:31.680]  I mean, I'm almost into it.
[2:27:31.680 --> 2:27:33.600]  I must say, you like black men, so...
[2:27:33.600 --> 2:27:34.600]  I would.
[2:27:34.600 --> 2:27:35.600]  Cut the hair a bit shorter, yeah?
[2:27:35.600 --> 2:27:36.600]  Then I'm in.
[2:27:36.600 --> 2:27:40.080]  So, would you like to date Michelle Obama?
[2:27:40.080 --> 2:27:43.760]  Well, she wouldn't be able to open her mouth, but yes, I would.
[2:27:43.760 --> 2:27:48.560]  Now, what the word is, is that her and Obama aren't really an item.
[2:27:48.560 --> 2:27:50.440]  What is it with these Democrat couples?
[2:27:50.440 --> 2:27:51.440]  You're a good-looking guy.
[2:27:51.440 --> 2:27:56.000]  Do you want to propose to him, to Michelle Obama right now, on-air, camera one, Milo?
[2:27:56.000 --> 2:27:57.000]  Go ahead.
[2:27:57.000 --> 2:27:58.000]  Milo, camera one.
[2:27:58.000 --> 2:27:59.000]  No.
[2:27:59.000 --> 2:28:00.000]  I will not be bullied into this.
[2:28:00.000 --> 2:28:03.680]  I am not going to take to the air to propose to Michelle Obama.
[2:28:03.680 --> 2:28:09.400]  I'm not going to go live on-air on InfoWars, suggesting that Michelle Obama should cut
[2:28:09.400 --> 2:28:14.920]  her hair shorter and that we should shack up together in my beachfront mansion in Miami.
[2:28:14.920 --> 2:28:19.680]  I will not be bullied into going on to the air with you and extending the warm hand
[2:28:19.680 --> 2:28:20.680]  of friendship and...
[2:28:20.680 --> 2:28:22.800]  By the way, he reaches out.
[2:28:22.800 --> 2:28:28.280]  But if he does call, my current boyfriend is going to be in for a nasty shock.
[2:28:28.280 --> 2:28:29.280]  All right.
[2:28:29.280 --> 2:28:30.280]  There you go.
[2:28:30.280 --> 2:28:32.920]  And see, that's not transphobia.
[2:28:32.920 --> 2:28:33.920]  That is embracing it.
[2:28:33.920 --> 2:28:35.880]  Do you know they call it the cotton ceiling?
[2:28:35.880 --> 2:28:36.880]  Did you know that?
[2:28:36.880 --> 2:28:37.880]  There's a...
[2:28:37.880 --> 2:28:42.640]  You know, like the glass ceiling, that imaginary upper limit beyond which women can't pass
[2:28:42.640 --> 2:28:44.120]  in corporate environments.
[2:28:44.120 --> 2:28:48.840]  Well, transgender people say that there's a bigotry involved in dating trannies.
[2:28:48.840 --> 2:28:53.080]  So, basically, when you find out that someone you thought was a woman is actually a man
[2:28:53.080 --> 2:28:56.160]  and you don't want to sleep with them, you're the weird one.
[2:28:56.160 --> 2:28:57.160]  You're a bigot.
[2:28:57.160 --> 2:28:59.640]  It's called the cotton ceiling because you don't want to peel back the underwear.
[2:28:59.640 --> 2:29:00.640]  Isn't that amazing?
[2:29:00.640 --> 2:29:04.320]  It's my favorite expression in the world called the cotton ceiling.
[2:29:04.320 --> 2:29:09.960]  Transgender people can't pass the cotton ceiling because their potential sexual partners are
[2:29:09.960 --> 2:29:13.120]  so off-put by their pasts.
[2:29:13.120 --> 2:29:18.120]  I'm fairly relaxed about people not wanting to have sex with women who have penises.
[2:29:18.120 --> 2:29:20.880]  But apparently, that's a new form of bigotry that we didn't know about.
[2:29:20.880 --> 2:29:23.760]  Well, I think it's all just people's taste is what it comes down to.
[2:29:23.760 --> 2:29:26.280]  And the left is trying to say, we're going to pick what your taste is.
[2:29:26.280 --> 2:29:27.840]  We're going to tell you what's funny.
[2:29:27.840 --> 2:29:28.840]  We're going to tell you who to like.
[2:29:28.840 --> 2:29:30.240]  We're going to tell you what the new trend is.
[2:29:30.240 --> 2:29:32.480]  How about humanity just decide?
[2:29:32.480 --> 2:29:36.760]  How about people just get on with their own individual lives, be left to their own conclusions,
[2:29:36.760 --> 2:29:40.280]  be left to their own preferences, be left to their own beliefs, allowed to say, do, and
[2:29:40.280 --> 2:29:43.000]  be whatever they want in the privacy of their own home so long as it doesn't affect what
[2:29:43.000 --> 2:29:44.000]  happens.
[2:29:44.000 --> 2:29:45.120]  That sounds like a Thomas Jefferson view.
[2:29:45.120 --> 2:29:46.600]  Sounds like America to me.
[2:29:46.600 --> 2:29:47.600]  Sounds like America.
[2:29:47.600 --> 2:29:48.600]  America with Milo.
[2:29:48.600 --> 2:29:50.000]  These weathers, the book is dangerous.
[2:29:50.000 --> 2:29:51.000]  Stay weathers.
[2:29:51.000 --> 2:29:52.000]  We're going to give the number.
[2:29:52.000 --> 2:29:53.000]  I'll take your call.
[2:29:53.000 --> 2:30:03.000]  Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[2:30:03.000 --> 2:30:04.400]  Why is the fungus?
[2:30:04.400 --> 2:30:05.480]  Why is the mold?
[2:30:05.480 --> 2:30:07.320]  Why is the yeast taking over?
[2:30:07.320 --> 2:30:08.320]  What is going on?
[2:30:08.320 --> 2:30:09.320]  What has changed?
[2:30:09.320 --> 2:30:14.240]  Dr. Group, the new product, Myco ZX supports normal fungal and yeast balance proprietary
[2:30:14.240 --> 2:30:17.080]  blend of herbs and enzymes made with high quality ingredients.
[2:30:17.080 --> 2:30:22.240]  Yeah, fungus is a growing epidemic and I've been testing this formula and making changes
[2:30:22.240 --> 2:30:24.560]  to this formula for over 10 years.
[2:30:24.560 --> 2:30:25.560]  It's available at M4WareStore.com.
[2:30:25.560 --> 2:30:26.560]  We also have free shipping.
[2:30:26.560 --> 2:30:32.240]  Order $50 or more and 10% off and you sign up for auto-ship additionally on top of that.
[2:30:32.240 --> 2:30:33.240]  Please.
[2:30:33.240 --> 2:30:35.000]  We only have a limited supply of this.
[2:30:35.000 --> 2:30:36.000]  I want to get your reviews on here.
[2:30:36.000 --> 2:30:37.000]  What do you have to say?
[2:30:37.000 --> 2:30:38.000]  For me, it's Ben Crow.
[2:30:38.000 --> 2:30:43.600]  Myco ZX, antifungal, antifungus, anti-yeast, get it today.
[2:30:43.600 --> 2:30:44.600]  Limited around, we'll be monthly.
[2:30:44.600 --> 2:30:45.600]  We'll get more.
[2:30:45.600 --> 2:30:46.600]  M4WareStore.com.
[2:30:46.600 --> 2:30:47.600]  M4WareStore.com.
[2:30:47.600 --> 2:30:49.720]  Our triple A, two, five, three, three, one, three, nine.
[2:30:49.720 --> 2:30:55.000]  I cannot sell something unless it helps somebody and you can't support an organization that
[2:30:55.000 --> 2:30:56.000]  didn't fight in order.
[2:30:56.000 --> 2:30:57.000]  Look at the response we're getting.
[2:30:57.000 --> 2:30:59.040]  Whoever changed the world together.
[2:30:59.040 --> 2:31:00.040]  You are the M4Ware.
[2:31:00.040 --> 2:31:01.040]  God bless you all.
[2:31:01.040 --> 2:31:08.120]  Hey, did you know that you can now preserve your own food for up to 25 years and still
[2:31:08.120 --> 2:31:11.120]  maintain its nutrition and flavor?
[2:31:11.120 --> 2:31:12.120]  That's right.
[2:31:12.120 --> 2:31:16.800]  Now's the time to build your own food storage with Harvest Rights Freeze Dryers.
[2:31:16.800 --> 2:31:22.280]  Go to M4WareStore.com to learn more and check out this innovative and smart technology that's
[2:31:22.280 --> 2:31:23.280]  easy to use.
[2:31:23.280 --> 2:31:24.280]  And let me tell you something.
[2:31:24.280 --> 2:31:29.960]  It is perfect for freeze drying fruits, vegetables, meats, dairy products, desserts, and entire
[2:31:29.960 --> 2:31:30.960]  meals.
[2:31:30.960 --> 2:31:31.960]  Woo!
[2:31:31.960 --> 2:31:32.960]  That's what I'm talking about.
[2:31:32.960 --> 2:31:37.360]  And when compared to traditional methods of preservation, like canning or dehydrating,
[2:31:37.360 --> 2:31:41.120]  you know, like what you get at the grocery store, there is no comparison.
[2:31:41.120 --> 2:31:47.200]  Harvest Right Freeze Dryers retain 97% of the food's taste, color, and nutritional value
[2:31:47.200 --> 2:31:50.680]  and have a shelf life of up to 25 years.
[2:31:50.680 --> 2:31:54.120]  Now that's what I call the miracle of food preservation.
[2:31:54.120 --> 2:31:58.280]  Harvest Right is truly the world's best, most affordable freeze dryer.
[2:31:58.280 --> 2:31:59.280]  So what are you waiting for?
[2:31:59.280 --> 2:32:02.160]  Check it out right now at M4WareStore.com.
[2:32:02.160 --> 2:32:06.920]  As most of you already know, I am a voracious consumer of news and information.
[2:32:06.920 --> 2:32:11.520]  And in the last four or five years doing more and more research, I came across the fact that
[2:32:11.520 --> 2:32:16.640]  the elite establishment is fully aware of the fact that our ancient ancestors, in many
[2:32:16.640 --> 2:32:19.760]  cases, had much better nutrition than we do today.
[2:32:19.760 --> 2:32:25.360]  And our ancient ancestors sought out the bones of the animals that they were hunting, killing,
[2:32:25.360 --> 2:32:26.360]  and then processing.
[2:32:26.360 --> 2:32:31.720]  And so I set out to develop Caveman, but to not just have concentrated bone broth from
[2:32:31.720 --> 2:32:38.520]  chicken, but seven other superfood ingredients known for cleansing and supercharging the
[2:32:38.520 --> 2:32:40.160]  body at the same time.
[2:32:40.160 --> 2:32:45.040]  M4Ware isn't just fighting the globalist, we're getting results and we're expanding
[2:32:45.040 --> 2:32:50.040]  in the face of the complete media assault and winning because of your support.
[2:32:50.040 --> 2:32:52.960]  Caveman is finally back at the M4Ware store.
[2:32:52.960 --> 2:32:58.440]  You can get 25% off the regular price for a limited time only at m4warslife.com or by
[2:32:58.440 --> 2:33:04.680]  calling toll-free, triple-A, two-five, three, three, one, three, nine.
[2:33:04.680 --> 2:33:11.960]  I have sworn upon the altar of God eternal hostility against every form of tyranny over
[2:33:11.960 --> 2:33:14.320]  the mind of man.
[2:33:14.320 --> 2:33:30.400]  Thomas Jefferson, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[2:33:30.400 --> 2:33:34.280]  Waging war on corruption, trashing the lies and disinformation.
[2:33:34.280 --> 2:33:40.200]  I'm your host, Alex Jones, Milo Yiannopoulos, one of the biggest icons in the new conservative
[2:33:40.200 --> 2:33:41.200]  movement.
[2:33:41.200 --> 2:33:46.560]  Well, right, we are the next wave of awakening of renaissance and human liberty worldwide.
[2:33:46.560 --> 2:33:52.600]  Now, we've got some big news breaking on m4wars.com and more of this will be in the second installment
[2:33:52.600 --> 2:33:55.160]  with Roger Stone coming up in the fourth hour.
[2:33:55.160 --> 2:33:59.480]  I'm commandeering that and we'll be co-hosting with the great Anthony Cummium.
[2:33:59.480 --> 2:34:06.040]  McMaster purging key Trump allies, deep state coup rooting out patriots from the White House.
[2:34:06.040 --> 2:34:07.760]  We have this from inside the White House.
[2:34:07.760 --> 2:34:12.400]  I have not even given you the data dump that other people would kill for.
[2:34:12.400 --> 2:34:14.840]  Okay, I'm going to just say this.
[2:34:14.840 --> 2:34:20.960]  This comes from the highest levels, highest levels.
[2:34:20.960 --> 2:34:26.120]  And we had a lot of discussions about whether to release this information or not.
[2:34:26.120 --> 2:34:32.000]  I called Roger and separately he got the same information yesterday from multiple White
[2:34:32.000 --> 2:34:36.400]  House sources, highest level.
[2:34:36.400 --> 2:34:38.520]  And it is crazy what's going on.
[2:34:38.520 --> 2:34:40.480]  So that's coming up in the next hour.
[2:34:40.480 --> 2:34:42.080]  Roger Stone will be joining us.
[2:34:42.080 --> 2:34:45.680]  I don't know what to say at this point.
[2:34:45.680 --> 2:34:50.280]  Briefly, we need your support.
[2:34:50.280 --> 2:34:53.840]  They took our Google advertising away that was going to bring in $5 million and that's
[2:34:53.840 --> 2:34:54.840]  not profit.
[2:34:54.840 --> 2:34:55.840]  That's $5 million.
[2:34:55.840 --> 2:34:57.280]  And people say, oh, that's no big deal.
[2:34:57.280 --> 2:34:59.200]  I'm paying for one video stream a month.
[2:34:59.200 --> 2:35:03.680]  We send out to everybody for free $50 plus thousand dollars and that's when it's not getting
[2:35:03.680 --> 2:35:04.680]  a bunch of bandwidth.
[2:35:04.680 --> 2:35:07.920]  I mean, RIT, we've got some of the biggest companies out there that even supply Google
[2:35:07.920 --> 2:35:08.920]  with bandwidth.
[2:35:08.920 --> 2:35:12.160]  We've got so many people watching our streams, listening to the streams, all of it.
[2:35:12.160 --> 2:35:17.600]  It's costing a lot of money, hundreds and hundreds of thousands a month, which is good.
[2:35:17.600 --> 2:35:19.520]  But it's just exponentially growing.
[2:35:19.520 --> 2:35:22.840]  As we get censored off YouTube and Google and Facebook and Twitter, people are coming
[2:35:22.840 --> 2:35:24.400]  to infowars.com.
[2:35:24.400 --> 2:35:26.360]  They're coming to our streams.
[2:35:26.360 --> 2:35:27.880]  So we lost, you know, $5 million.
[2:35:27.880 --> 2:35:32.640]  It was $3.3 million we made last year off of the ads we had on Google.
[2:35:32.640 --> 2:35:33.640]  Then they banned us.
[2:35:33.640 --> 2:35:35.680]  It was trending to be $5 million this year.
[2:35:35.680 --> 2:35:39.840]  And that was like the extra money we had budgeted for what we were going to do this year.
[2:35:39.840 --> 2:35:43.600]  Now you've come through supporting us more, buying T-shirts, buying Bill Clinton rape
[2:35:43.600 --> 2:35:47.160]  whistles, you know, all of it, but we need support now more than ever.
[2:35:47.160 --> 2:35:48.400]  Look at Milo Yiannopoulos.
[2:35:48.400 --> 2:35:53.160]  They took his book, number one on Amazon, is in the top 10 on New York Times bestseller.
[2:35:53.160 --> 2:35:54.800]  It was going to go to number one.
[2:35:54.800 --> 2:35:55.800]  They didn't know what to do.
[2:35:55.800 --> 2:35:59.360]  So they banned the book that they were already printing, would not allow it to go on store
[2:35:59.360 --> 2:36:00.360]  shelves.
[2:36:00.360 --> 2:36:02.240]  He's suing them for $10 million.
[2:36:02.240 --> 2:36:06.720]  It's an act of resistance to get this book and to make it top of the charts again, just
[2:36:06.720 --> 2:36:09.080]  to show them they're not going to be victorious.
[2:36:09.080 --> 2:36:11.520]  It's available at infowarstore.com.
[2:36:11.520 --> 2:36:13.320]  It's available at dangerous.com.
[2:36:13.320 --> 2:36:16.480]  Yeah, you can get it at Amazon just to make a point, make it number one again.
[2:36:16.480 --> 2:36:20.640]  But I was told by a little bird off record that they do other things like just don't
[2:36:20.640 --> 2:36:21.800]  let it show up as top.
[2:36:21.800 --> 2:36:25.120]  I mean, that's happened to me when in-game was the number one documentary years ago.
[2:36:25.120 --> 2:36:26.120]  I put it out 10 years ago.
[2:36:26.120 --> 2:36:27.120]  It was number one for a week.
[2:36:27.120 --> 2:36:30.440]  It was causing us to sell thousands of extra a day just because it was number one.
[2:36:30.440 --> 2:36:32.320]  And then they just knocked it out completely.
[2:36:32.320 --> 2:36:33.320]  It didn't even show up.
[2:36:33.320 --> 2:36:37.360]  When you're at the top of the charts, it has an effect, it has a bumping effect on sales.
[2:36:37.360 --> 2:36:41.000]  So they'll only let people go to number one who they want to sell more copies.
[2:36:41.000 --> 2:36:44.280]  Remember, the New York Times four or five years ago said, we're not letting conservatives
[2:36:44.280 --> 2:36:46.000]  be number one on the New York Times list.
[2:36:46.000 --> 2:36:47.560]  In fact, we're just banning them.
[2:36:47.560 --> 2:36:53.600]  We know that last week, this week it wasn't the case, but last week I had the top selling
[2:36:53.600 --> 2:36:59.280]  hardcover nonfiction book in the country by a considerable margin, by over 7,000 copies.
[2:36:59.280 --> 2:37:03.200]  But they put me at number five, and they put me after a book that I had outsold by two
[2:37:03.200 --> 2:37:04.200]  to one.
[2:37:04.200 --> 2:37:08.880]  The one they put at number one was a book about Trump and Bannon because it was written
[2:37:08.880 --> 2:37:09.880]  by a liberal.
[2:37:09.880 --> 2:37:10.880]  Just crammed that earpiece and shoved it in.
[2:37:10.880 --> 2:37:11.880]  Yes.
[2:37:11.880 --> 2:37:12.880]  I don't know.
[2:37:12.880 --> 2:37:13.880]  I'm having a kind of Mariah Carey.
[2:37:13.880 --> 2:37:14.880]  Why are you scared to shove it in there all the way?
[2:37:14.880 --> 2:37:15.880]  There you go.
[2:37:15.880 --> 2:37:16.880]  Go ahead.
[2:37:16.880 --> 2:37:17.880]  She goes to cramming big things into small-
[2:37:17.880 --> 2:37:18.880]  Oh, that's not what I meant.
[2:37:18.880 --> 2:37:19.880]  Never mind.
[2:37:19.880 --> 2:37:20.880]  Never mind.
[2:37:20.880 --> 2:37:21.880]  That dirty mind over there.
[2:37:21.880 --> 2:37:22.880]  I can't help it.
[2:37:22.880 --> 2:37:23.880]  I can't help it.
[2:37:23.880 --> 2:37:24.880]  There we go.
[2:37:24.880 --> 2:37:27.920]  You know, if you ever see Mariah Carey in concerts, she's constantly touching her earpieces,
[2:37:27.920 --> 2:37:29.920]  become like a tick.
[2:37:29.920 --> 2:37:32.920]  I've got a tick.
[2:37:32.920 --> 2:37:38.080]  What they did was they put me behind a book that I outsold by two to one.
[2:37:38.080 --> 2:37:41.480]  I sold double the number of copies, but they put me behind it at number five.
[2:37:41.480 --> 2:37:44.160]  And the number one book, I'd outsold by 6,000 copies.
[2:37:44.160 --> 2:37:50.240]  I sold by far and away, by a clear margin, the most hardcover nonfiction books last week,
[2:37:50.240 --> 2:37:52.640]  and The New York Times put me at number five because they just wouldn't let me have the
[2:37:52.640 --> 2:37:53.640]  number five.
[2:37:53.640 --> 2:37:56.640]  Because they know it will create the cascade to make it number one, and then you'll just
[2:37:56.640 --> 2:37:58.960]  stay there for six months, and that makes them look bad.
[2:37:58.960 --> 2:37:59.960]  Yeah, exactly.
[2:37:59.960 --> 2:38:03.920]  And, you know, because, and this is the same reason that retailers, you know, we had a
[2:38:03.920 --> 2:38:07.320]  huge fight with Barnes & Noble to finally get the book on the shelves of Barnes & Noble
[2:38:07.320 --> 2:38:10.880]  because they know that once people start to see it around, it creates demand.
[2:38:10.880 --> 2:38:12.880]  When it's in stock at Amazon, you get the green tick.
[2:38:12.880 --> 2:38:16.680]  People are more likely to buy it than when it's out of stock.
[2:38:16.680 --> 2:38:20.880]  So this is, you know, this is, so the story is we're winning the culture war, whether
[2:38:20.880 --> 2:38:25.440]  you call it libertarian, conservative, evangelical Christians don't like being kicked around,
[2:38:25.440 --> 2:38:26.800]  most defending them.
[2:38:26.800 --> 2:38:29.920]  Whatever people that don't want to be killed by Muslims, you know, like the nightclub getting
[2:38:29.920 --> 2:38:30.920]  shot up.
[2:38:30.920 --> 2:38:33.920]  And then they tried to spin that in the media that I said, gays deserve to die.
[2:38:33.920 --> 2:38:38.720]  I said, why are gays so liberal when they're the ones getting killed by these people getting
[2:38:38.720 --> 2:38:40.840]  shot and they turned that into I was blaming them.
[2:38:40.840 --> 2:38:44.480]  No, I was saying, why aren't you for being defending yourself?
[2:38:44.480 --> 2:38:45.480]  It's the same thing.
[2:38:45.480 --> 2:38:47.560]  And this, you know, this is, but I didn't shoot the people.
[2:38:47.560 --> 2:38:49.640]  No, I'm saying you need to like, you know, defend yourself.
[2:38:49.640 --> 2:38:52.120]  You're the bad guy for saying, why don't you stick up for your own interests?
[2:38:52.120 --> 2:38:55.400]  It's the same thing as a sort of weird, weird quirk of America that I haven't worked out
[2:38:55.400 --> 2:38:56.400]  yet.
[2:38:56.400 --> 2:39:00.240]  Why so many, look at camera one, talk to those audience out there.
[2:39:00.240 --> 2:39:04.840]  The weird quirk of America, I haven't really worked out why so many of my fellow Jews are
[2:39:04.840 --> 2:39:11.080]  so liberal in America when the left has been, has been opposed to the existence of Israel,
[2:39:11.080 --> 2:39:13.960]  has been actively denying Israel's right to exist.
[2:39:13.960 --> 2:39:16.120]  I mean, your viewers are going to have various different points.
[2:39:16.120 --> 2:39:20.000]  But the Soros documents came out, he wants to destroy Israel, but this is always been
[2:39:20.000 --> 2:39:25.080]  so weird to me why so many well educated, wealthy Jews in America are so left wing.
[2:39:25.080 --> 2:39:26.080]  Why are they all Democrats?
[2:39:26.080 --> 2:39:27.080]  I don't get it.
[2:39:27.080 --> 2:39:28.280]  I don't understand this.
[2:39:28.280 --> 2:39:34.400]  I don't understand why gays, unless I just don't get why gays listen to women like this,
[2:39:34.400 --> 2:39:38.920]  who want to pander to them, who want to say, oh, you know, after a tragedy, let love win,
[2:39:38.920 --> 2:39:44.360]  let's stop the hate, let's have rainbow hashtags on Twitter, yet she'll take tens of millions
[2:39:44.360 --> 2:39:48.480]  of dollars from countries that, you know, that want us dead and that fund terrorists
[2:39:48.480 --> 2:39:50.200]  that throw us off roofs.
[2:39:50.200 --> 2:39:55.640]  You know, that pander to and mollycoddle radical Islam and the gap between what they say and
[2:39:55.640 --> 2:40:00.680]  what they do, between how they describe themselves to us and what they actually do for us is
[2:40:00.680 --> 2:40:01.680]  remarkable.
[2:40:01.680 --> 2:40:04.680]  And I was interviewed by somebody from Mediaite the other day and he's like, well, what about
[2:40:04.680 --> 2:40:08.080]  this, this anti-LGBT, anti-gay Trump presidency?
[2:40:08.080 --> 2:40:10.160]  And I said, what are you talking about?
[2:40:10.160 --> 2:40:11.600]  I don't care what he says.
[2:40:11.600 --> 2:40:18.120]  I don't care if the White House issues some lame, gushing, national gay pride proclamation.
[2:40:18.120 --> 2:40:21.600]  I want him to stop Muslims coming into the country so I don't get killed.
[2:40:21.600 --> 2:40:23.040]  Like what are you on about?
[2:40:23.040 --> 2:40:28.360]  And the gap between, you know, speaking and action is key to understanding the liberal
[2:40:28.360 --> 2:40:29.360]  market.
[2:40:29.360 --> 2:40:31.680]  Well, the point is, is that the so-called left ones control the culture.
[2:40:31.680 --> 2:40:36.040]  It's a power trip and a lot of people existentially through it feel like they're in power when
[2:40:36.040 --> 2:40:37.040]  they're not.
[2:40:37.040 --> 2:40:40.680]  They're imagining with reflected glory from Hillary that they're in charge and now that
[2:40:40.680 --> 2:40:44.960]  their idol has fallen, they don't know what to do and are attacking more than ever to
[2:40:44.960 --> 2:40:48.720]  bully people into submission and that's backfiring spectacularly.
[2:40:48.720 --> 2:40:51.360]  So let me ask you this question.
[2:40:51.360 --> 2:40:53.720]  Where are they culturally on the so-called left?
[2:40:53.720 --> 2:40:56.840]  And where do you see it going as they get more and more histrionic, more and more desperate?
[2:40:56.840 --> 2:40:58.720]  But first, a toll-free number to join us.
[2:40:58.720 --> 2:41:07.680]  Your questions for Milo Yiannopoulos on his dangerous tour, 800-259-9231-800-259-9231.
[2:41:07.680 --> 2:41:13.600]  First-time callers, quick questions or comments for Milo, 800-259-9231.
[2:41:13.600 --> 2:41:17.680]  Many of the crew that, I know Daria is a big fan, they want to pop that answer question.
[2:41:17.680 --> 2:41:19.040]  They're welcome to as well.
[2:41:19.040 --> 2:41:20.720]  But really, where are they right now?
[2:41:20.720 --> 2:41:23.280]  Because we sit here and laugh about it and we're winning.
[2:41:23.280 --> 2:41:24.800]  They're saying kill the president.
[2:41:24.800 --> 2:41:25.800]  They're saying coup d'etat.
[2:41:25.800 --> 2:41:29.760]  They've got former CIA directors on TV saying we're about to overthrow him.
[2:41:29.760 --> 2:41:32.800]  We've got congressmen saying, yeah, they're shopping in on the hill.
[2:41:32.800 --> 2:41:36.040]  Limboss talked to congress folks who are saying they're trying to get top generals to lead
[2:41:36.040 --> 2:41:37.040]  a coup.
[2:41:37.040 --> 2:41:38.040]  I mean, that's illegal.
[2:41:38.040 --> 2:41:41.560]  So we sit here and joke about this, but you know, we've got leftist threatening Paul
[2:41:41.560 --> 2:41:45.640]  Watson saying we're going to purge you soon, we're going to kill you soon.
[2:41:45.640 --> 2:41:48.360]  And then Twitter promotes them saying they're going to kill us.
[2:41:48.360 --> 2:41:55.680]  I mean, I think the bad news is they're throwing everything they have at legitimately elected
[2:41:55.680 --> 2:41:56.680]  president.
[2:41:56.680 --> 2:42:02.680]  The good news is in cultural terms, in big civilizational terms, over decades, that is,
[2:42:02.680 --> 2:42:04.400]  they are going to lose.
[2:42:04.400 --> 2:42:10.720]  We've had 30 years of the nannying, pole-clutching, pandering social justice left of the political
[2:42:10.720 --> 2:42:14.280]  correctness of all of the kind of stuff that people reacted against so violently.
[2:42:14.280 --> 2:42:16.080]  Of crazy-eyed control freaks.
[2:42:16.080 --> 2:42:17.080]  Yes, exactly.
[2:42:17.080 --> 2:42:19.320]  And you're absolutely right in everything you say about those people.
[2:42:19.320 --> 2:42:22.400]  I've listened to you when you talk about them and you write about them.
[2:42:22.400 --> 2:42:26.400]  The way you describe it is accurate, exactly what they are, swivel-eyed, lunatic control
[2:42:26.400 --> 2:42:32.240]  freaks who just, you know, who live to legislate other people's behavior, language, dress codes,
[2:42:32.240 --> 2:42:34.000]  speech codes, you name it.
[2:42:34.000 --> 2:42:37.400]  This is what these people wake up in the morning working out new, you know, working out hand.
[2:42:37.400 --> 2:42:38.400]  They're buzz kills.
[2:42:38.400 --> 2:42:41.040]  Well, yeah, this is what I'm about to say.
[2:42:41.040 --> 2:42:48.040]  They're funless, joyless, this horrible, anodyne, faceless America they want to build this kind
[2:42:48.040 --> 2:42:53.600]  of, this ugly, joyless hell where no one can tell a joke, no one can have an interesting
[2:42:53.600 --> 2:42:54.600]  or fun.
[2:42:54.600 --> 2:42:56.920]  And the buildings, all they admit, have to be ugly.
[2:42:56.920 --> 2:43:02.920]  Well, you can't, nobody can wear a costume, nobody can tell a joke, nobody can have a
[2:43:02.920 --> 2:43:10.560]  particular hairstyle, nobody can do or say or be anything except this narrow little band
[2:43:10.560 --> 2:43:11.560]  of what they tell you.
[2:43:11.560 --> 2:43:15.960]  And they're always fighting with each other over what that is, isn't that why they're
[2:43:15.960 --> 2:43:17.560]  going to go down there fighting with themselves?
[2:43:17.560 --> 2:43:22.280]  Well, it's another mechanism of control requiring you to sign up for a definition that constantly
[2:43:22.280 --> 2:43:26.440]  changes because it requires you to always be, it means that you're always in fear because
[2:43:26.440 --> 2:43:30.320]  you never know what's going to be racist today because the definition of racist...
[2:43:30.320 --> 2:43:33.080]  They're always moving the goalposts and enlarging, exactly.
[2:43:33.080 --> 2:43:34.080]  This is why they're going to lose.
[2:43:34.080 --> 2:43:37.440]  They're going to lose, in my view, mostly because they're so funless.
[2:43:37.440 --> 2:43:39.560]  Look how much fun we've had on the show today.
[2:43:39.560 --> 2:43:43.000]  We've been laughing, we've been joking, we've been enjoying ourselves.
[2:43:43.000 --> 2:43:45.480]  People at home are enjoying themselves.
[2:43:45.480 --> 2:43:50.680]  Compare that with CNN, with the gloomy, the sad CNN meme.
[2:43:50.680 --> 2:43:57.520]  We manage the sort of populist, nationalist, conservative and libertarian movement manage
[2:43:57.520 --> 2:44:05.000]  to find some joy in what is otherwise a completely funless progressive left established.
[2:44:05.000 --> 2:44:06.000]  So where does it go?
[2:44:06.000 --> 2:44:10.640]  Because they've gone to the 99%ile of let's have a coup, let's kill Trump, let's imprison
[2:44:10.640 --> 2:44:11.640]  everybody.
[2:44:11.640 --> 2:44:12.640]  I mean, there's only 1% more.
[2:44:12.640 --> 2:44:14.840]  It's for them to start the violence at a new level.
[2:44:14.840 --> 2:44:15.840]  I mean, what?
[2:44:15.840 --> 2:44:16.840]  Well, they're not in power.
[2:44:16.840 --> 2:44:20.120]  It seems to me far fetched that they're actually going to try to kill the president.
[2:44:20.120 --> 2:44:22.120]  I mean, are they really going to assassinate Trump?
[2:44:22.120 --> 2:44:24.120]  I mean, it seems a lot.
[2:44:24.120 --> 2:44:25.600]  That would really blow up in their face.
[2:44:25.600 --> 2:44:27.200]  I can't imagine they'd go there.
[2:44:27.200 --> 2:44:28.320]  Even him into a martyr?
[2:44:28.320 --> 2:44:29.320]  Come now.
[2:44:29.320 --> 2:44:32.800]  You know, of all people to turn into a martyr, Donald Trump, you know, would be an obvious
[2:44:32.800 --> 2:44:34.480]  smart choice.
[2:44:34.480 --> 2:44:37.000]  You know, this is...
[2:44:37.000 --> 2:44:39.960]  But look, I really firmly...
[2:44:39.960 --> 2:44:43.880]  See, if I was Matthew Vellion, somebody would actually go after Trump to ensure we totally
[2:44:43.880 --> 2:44:44.880]  went.
[2:44:44.880 --> 2:44:45.880]  I don't want that to happen.
[2:44:45.880 --> 2:44:48.040]  Oh, I see, if you were doing a false flag or something.
[2:44:48.040 --> 2:44:49.560]  Yeah, I mean, sorry, go ahead.
[2:44:49.560 --> 2:44:52.240]  Yeah, no, no, no.
[2:44:52.240 --> 2:44:56.720]  You worry because you don't know how these people, when you think about this family.
[2:44:56.720 --> 2:44:59.800]  Well, I'm actually trying to get them to think, don't kill him, it's going to blow up in your
[2:44:59.800 --> 2:45:00.800]  face.
[2:45:00.800 --> 2:45:04.480]  I'm explaining that to them because they're so enraged, they're not thinking in a multi-dimensional
[2:45:04.480 --> 2:45:05.480]  way.
[2:45:05.480 --> 2:45:08.280]  I think they're obviously trying to unseat him from the presidency in any way they can.
[2:45:08.280 --> 2:45:11.120]  I think that far I will go.
[2:45:11.120 --> 2:45:16.080]  And the ways in which they're doing it are dishonest and sneaky and miserable, and the
[2:45:16.080 --> 2:45:19.360]  commentary is depressing and angry and furious all the time.
[2:45:19.360 --> 2:45:23.440]  And I really firmly believe that one of the main ways that we have, one of the main tools
[2:45:23.440 --> 2:45:27.480]  that we have at our disposal, is fun, and joy, and mischief.
[2:45:27.480 --> 2:45:32.280]  Whether it's the Mimi Trolley hoards that carried Trump into the White House, or whether
[2:45:32.280 --> 2:45:37.960]  it's just enjoying ourselves, people are attracted to fun, happy people, and if we
[2:45:37.960 --> 2:45:38.960]  can tell the truth.
[2:45:38.960 --> 2:45:40.480]  Exactly, and laughing at the left.
[2:45:40.480 --> 2:45:45.040]  If we can tell the truth, but wrap it in a good joke, if we can be more fun than the
[2:45:45.040 --> 2:45:46.040]  other side.
[2:45:46.040 --> 2:45:48.200]  No, I agree, that's why I like your show, because I need to get more, I mean, I could
[2:45:48.200 --> 2:45:49.200]  be funny when I want.
[2:45:49.200 --> 2:45:53.960]  I tend to get so serious, and because we are in such serious times, but it's important
[2:45:53.960 --> 2:45:57.600]  to have some fun sometimes, as well, before we go any further with some phone calls.
[2:45:57.600 --> 2:46:00.280]  Again, free shipping was supposed to end yesterday.
[2:46:00.280 --> 2:46:04.080]  I notice they haven't ended it yet, but the specials did end, but free shipping one more
[2:46:04.080 --> 2:46:06.480]  day and it is going to end today.
[2:46:06.480 --> 2:46:07.480]  But here are the new specials.
[2:46:07.480 --> 2:46:12.160]  We're having the 1776 specials in the month of August.
[2:46:12.160 --> 2:46:17.720]  We have, Brainforce, our amazing Neutropic, 1776, that's 55% off, we've never done that
[2:46:17.720 --> 2:46:21.560]  before, the people love it, I want people that haven't tried it to try it.
[2:46:21.560 --> 2:46:26.040]  Amazing Neutropic uses the top ingredients out there known for a healthy, focused brain
[2:46:26.040 --> 2:46:27.040]  with energy.
[2:46:27.040 --> 2:46:31.440]  We have Survival Shield, the Good Halogen, X2, 55% off, we've never done that.
[2:46:31.440 --> 2:46:34.440]  I want folks to enjoy that, we just got a big shipment in.

[2:47:11.040 --> 2:47:14.400]  That's back in stock, John Oliver's attacking it saying it's horrible, that it tastes terrible,
[2:47:14.400 --> 2:47:18.400]  it tastes okay with water, it tastes great with milk and some ice, but just don't believe
[2:47:18.400 --> 2:47:21.840]  me, try it for yourself, but what matters is the energy, the stamina, you think a bowl
[2:47:21.840 --> 2:47:25.800]  of chicken noodle soup is good, this is chicken noodle soup squared, the next power, that's

[2:47:51.480 --> 2:47:54.920]  I wasn't going to go back to this, but I was just looking at the pictures before, I actually
[2:47:54.920 --> 2:47:56.440]  started reading it.
[2:47:56.440 --> 2:48:00.360]  Madeline Albright's a good looking man.
[2:48:00.360 --> 2:48:05.520]  The baboons weren't interested, but Hillary Rodham Clinton was warming to her subject,
[2:48:05.520 --> 2:48:10.280]  well even the monkeys don't care, while a couple of primates watched from a nearby
[2:48:10.280 --> 2:48:15.720]  boulder, more taken by the remnants of a lavish picnic than their high profile visitor, the
[2:48:15.720 --> 2:48:28.840]  first lady delivered an exegesis on women's advancements, but isn't it interesting, I mean
[2:48:28.840 --> 2:48:39.760]  if you take the, if you take the primates as a proxy for the rest of us, you know, those
[2:48:39.760 --> 2:48:53.040]  of us who are messy and scrappy and you know, we are ungrateful ignoring her, her sermon
[2:48:53.040 --> 2:48:56.960]  on the mount about women's empowerment, well that's a pretty good metaphor, it's a pretty
[2:48:56.960 --> 2:49:01.120]  good allegory for what happened in the election, isn't it, the rest of us, she was banging
[2:49:01.120 --> 2:49:04.440]  on about women and the rest of us just weren't that interested, we were more interested
[2:49:04.440 --> 2:49:10.240]  in the picnic, and we were more interested, women were more interested just in having
[2:49:10.240 --> 2:49:14.160]  a good life, I mean I was only taking the mickey out of the pictures, well a creepy
[2:49:14.160 --> 2:49:18.400]  woman telling women how much she loves them, now I've actually started reading it, it's
[2:49:18.400 --> 2:49:22.320]  even better, I told you, you've got to get this, you can write a whole book about this,
[2:49:22.320 --> 2:49:25.520]  oh you've got to get this, since I started plugging it, it's gone from like four dollars
[2:49:25.520 --> 2:49:30.280]  on, eBay to like 50, yeah, yeah, yeah, because I want to republish this, well if you've been
[2:49:30.280 --> 2:49:34.640]  smart, you would have bought 5,000 of them and it's not driving the price up on the
[2:49:34.640 --> 2:49:39.240]  ship, well maybe I've let people into your secrets, it's actually going on, I've actually
[2:49:39.240 --> 2:49:45.440]  been trying to corner the market and the Madame President, the most unintentional comedy
[2:49:45.440 --> 2:49:51.200]  in the galaxy, give that back, you can have the right whistle but you can't have that,
[2:49:51.200 --> 2:49:55.640]  I have, this is a dilemma I've got in front of me, you know what, I've already ordered
[2:49:55.640 --> 2:50:01.080]  more, you may have it to show on C-SPAN, promise you will and I'll give it to you, this is
[2:50:01.080 --> 2:50:06.320]  a right whistle blown by Alex Jones or the Madame President Newsweek special, if I only
[2:50:06.320 --> 2:50:10.080]  got to pick one, I don't think I'd be able to choose, I don't think I'd be able to choose,
[2:50:10.080 --> 2:50:14.320]  I'm taking both, you can actually, but promise you'll show it on C-SPAN, I'll promise to
[2:50:14.320 --> 2:50:19.320]  try, maybe what I'll do is I'll take a purple folder and say it's my notes and I'll produce
[2:50:19.320 --> 2:50:28.280]  it, just say, well one of the reasons I wrote the book is things like this, this will be
[2:50:28.280 --> 2:50:32.360]  a day long remember, I hope it's live, I hope it's live, if it was, now we've given it away
[2:50:32.360 --> 2:50:37.120]  but they don't watch this show, but what you do is you just tape the audio and then if
[2:50:37.120 --> 2:50:41.040]  they don't play it you go here is the censored and then you're, that words will get 10 million
[2:50:41.040 --> 2:50:44.920]  views, great hero of the conservative movement, Matt Purdy my cameraman with me who always
[2:50:44.920 --> 2:50:48.520]  does this stuff, we have to, we have to, you have to tape Megan Kelly, I have to take
[2:50:48.520 --> 2:50:52.240]  him, like here's the thing, I've not been, I've not been taping you today, I'm like
[2:50:52.240 --> 2:50:55.720]  where's my phone, because I, because I know I don't, I don't have to, we're live, where's
[2:50:55.720 --> 2:51:00.040]  my phone, but I taped her because she's a lying snake who just got her show canceled,

[2:54:34.600 --> 2:54:36.920]  blackholing anything the left doesn't like.
[2:54:36.920 --> 2:54:40.920]  Yeah, well you and I are going to have a conversation after this show and let's see if it ends up
[2:54:40.920 --> 2:54:42.760]  in the YouTube black hole or not.
[2:54:42.760 --> 2:54:46.200]  But you can search for me on YouTube and subscribe to that and you can find me on Facebook as
[2:54:46.200 --> 2:54:47.200]  well.
[2:54:47.200 --> 2:54:49.320]  And a lot of them say we don't ban it, just no one can see it.
[2:54:49.320 --> 2:54:52.360]  No, well yeah, so they put a screen up in front of it that you have to click through
[2:54:52.360 --> 2:54:55.800]  to get to it, no comments, no voting, they won't promote it.
[2:54:55.800 --> 2:54:56.800]  You can't share it.
[2:54:56.800 --> 2:54:59.400]  You can't share it and these are all of the, well what else, what are you going to be on
[2:54:59.400 --> 2:55:00.400]  YouTube for then?
[2:55:00.400 --> 2:55:01.400]  You know, the whole point.
[2:55:01.400 --> 2:55:03.400]  And of course that's just the precursor to outright bans.
[2:55:03.400 --> 2:55:04.400]  Of course.
[2:55:04.400 --> 2:55:08.320]  Now, we're going to go to your phone calls right now, but you were pointing out that
[2:55:08.320 --> 2:55:12.200]  all of us should be taking a victory lap because despite the fact we're being persecuted, they're
[2:55:12.200 --> 2:55:14.920]  falling and Megyn Kelly's having her show cancelled.
[2:55:14.920 --> 2:55:18.680]  You should take the credit for that because I think the credit is yours.
[2:55:18.680 --> 2:55:23.200]  I think you should take the victory lap there, you know, now without getting into the subject
[2:55:23.200 --> 2:55:28.960]  matter of the specific interview you did with her, the mess around that and the fact that
[2:55:28.960 --> 2:55:33.840]  she was undermined by your cleverness in recording everything that you communicated
[2:55:33.840 --> 2:55:35.880]  with her and all the rest of it.
[2:55:35.880 --> 2:55:39.880]  And also the stupidity of the rest of the media, I mean look, they can believe whatever
[2:55:39.880 --> 2:55:42.800]  they want about you or about me.
[2:55:42.800 --> 2:55:44.200]  They can say what they like.
[2:55:44.200 --> 2:55:47.880]  They can call us whatever names they want, but it doesn't matter.
[2:55:47.880 --> 2:55:52.520]  If somebody is influential, is a big presence in public life and has a huge fan base, they're
[2:55:52.520 --> 2:55:53.520]  of course newsworthy.
[2:55:53.520 --> 2:55:55.520]  That's the definition of newsworthy.
[2:55:55.520 --> 2:56:01.000]  It's not, you know, the way that they treated her for daring to interview you just because
[2:56:01.000 --> 2:56:03.640]  you have a big audience is it was remarkable.
[2:56:03.640 --> 2:56:07.360]  And I think combination of that and the way that you conducted yourself and the way you
[2:56:07.360 --> 2:56:10.200]  handled that interview was really smart.
[2:56:10.200 --> 2:56:12.200]  And I think you should take a victory lap for the end.
[2:56:12.200 --> 2:56:13.200]  Well, I appreciate that.
[2:56:13.200 --> 2:56:16.360]  I mean, I know I was walking into a trap, but I knew that no matter what they did, it was
[2:56:16.360 --> 2:56:17.920]  meant to be my destruction.
[2:56:17.920 --> 2:56:20.640]  People hate the mainstream, no matter what they do, they're done.
[2:56:20.640 --> 2:56:22.240]  So it's, I mean, they're that pathetic.
[2:56:22.240 --> 2:56:23.240]  All right.
[2:56:23.240 --> 2:56:27.440]  We got Ben, Teresa, we got Van, we got Adam, we got Dan and many others, and who's been
[2:56:27.440 --> 2:56:29.560]  holding the longest here?
[2:56:29.560 --> 2:56:31.600]  Let's go to Dan in Florida.
[2:56:31.600 --> 2:56:32.600]  You're on the air with Milo.
[2:56:32.600 --> 2:56:33.600]  Go ahead, Dan.
[2:56:33.600 --> 2:56:37.560]  Alex Milo, you guys are my heroes.
[2:56:37.560 --> 2:56:38.560]  Thanks for taking my call.
[2:56:38.560 --> 2:56:39.560]  Thanks for calling, buddy.
[2:56:39.560 --> 2:56:40.560]  Go ahead.
[2:56:40.560 --> 2:56:44.040]  First off, first off, I just wanted to plug the products because they're amazing.
[2:56:44.040 --> 2:56:50.400]  And I got BrainForce, Knockout, X2, SuperMail, Caveman, Blood and Marrow Fusion to really
[2:56:50.400 --> 2:56:51.400]  change my life.
[2:56:51.400 --> 2:56:52.880]  It's quite a pill lineup for the morning.
[2:56:52.880 --> 2:56:57.080]  I mean, you don't get to cereal in the morning because you've got a lot of pills.
[2:56:57.080 --> 2:56:58.080]  It works.
[2:56:58.080 --> 2:56:59.080]  You've got to take the SuperMail Vitality.
[2:56:59.080 --> 2:57:00.480]  I'll give it a try.
[2:57:00.480 --> 2:57:01.480]  I promise to try.
[2:57:01.480 --> 2:57:02.480]  Go ahead.
[2:57:02.480 --> 2:57:03.480]  Sorry, sorry.
[2:57:03.480 --> 2:57:07.880]  I've lost 25 pounds this year since I started taking it all regularly.
[2:57:07.880 --> 2:57:08.880]  I feel great.
[2:57:08.880 --> 2:57:14.720]  Anyway, I just wanted to, what you prefaced with about YouTube actually segues into what
[2:57:14.720 --> 2:57:16.960]  I wanted to ask Milo and you.
[2:57:16.960 --> 2:57:21.480]  So in April, I started my own YouTube channel and it was going pretty well.
[2:57:21.480 --> 2:57:24.840]  I got up to about 1,400 subscribers.
[2:57:24.840 --> 2:57:29.680]  And on August 1st, right when that whole YouTube thing was going down, I woke up and
[2:57:29.680 --> 2:57:35.200]  found that my channel had been hit with three copyright strikes all at once and deleted.
[2:57:35.200 --> 2:57:40.440]  And then YouTube wouldn't even let me appeal it, they suspended my account.
[2:57:40.440 --> 2:57:41.680]  So I'm just kind of having.
[2:57:41.680 --> 2:57:42.680]  That's right.
[2:57:42.680 --> 2:57:45.120]  They get rid of the little guys up front.
[2:57:45.120 --> 2:57:47.800]  But once you're big, they don't want to make a big example, so they do it slowly.
[2:57:47.800 --> 2:57:51.920]  That's why you've got to do stuff that's purely yours or say, I'm going to analyze this news
[2:57:51.920 --> 2:57:54.400]  clip under fair use and then do that.
[2:57:54.400 --> 2:57:55.400]  Yeah.
[2:57:55.400 --> 2:57:58.040]  And then they, and then, and then, but they'll still strike you, but when you appeal it,
[2:57:58.040 --> 2:57:59.040]  they generally.
[2:57:59.040 --> 2:58:00.480]  But as he said, they're not even letting people appeal now.
[2:58:00.480 --> 2:58:01.480]  No.
[2:58:01.480 --> 2:58:05.040]  Well, I get every day, practically every day, I get an email from them saying, your
[2:58:05.040 --> 2:58:07.560]  video is not suitable for monetization.
[2:58:07.560 --> 2:58:08.960]  And it's about some old video.
[2:58:08.960 --> 2:58:09.960]  We do, too.
[2:58:09.960 --> 2:58:10.960]  I don't have that many videos on my channel.
[2:58:10.960 --> 2:58:15.280]  I mean, I have like, I don't know, 650,000 subscribers and I, but all my old college
[2:58:15.280 --> 2:58:17.800]  talks are on there and they're going to be on there again in the new tour, a troll academy
[2:58:17.800 --> 2:58:18.800]  coming later in the year.
[2:58:18.800 --> 2:58:21.320]  But I get emails almost every day.
[2:58:21.320 --> 2:58:24.200]  They knew videos they've discovered from my archives is just like, no, we're not letting
[2:58:24.200 --> 2:58:25.400]  this guy have any ad revenue.
[2:58:25.400 --> 2:58:28.100]  So, you know, I mean, it was never really a big thing for me.
[2:58:28.100 --> 2:58:29.100]  But I did go from making.
[2:58:29.100 --> 2:58:34.280]  Our revenue is down 60, no, 76% since they did this on YouTube.
[2:58:34.280 --> 2:58:35.280]  They're strangling us.
[2:58:35.280 --> 2:58:36.280]  It wasn't a big thing for me.
[2:58:36.280 --> 2:58:39.840]  I don't have a big operation like you, but I think I was earning maybe 20K a month from
[2:58:39.840 --> 2:58:40.840]  YouTube and now it's it.
[2:58:40.840 --> 2:58:41.840]  Hold on.
[2:58:41.840 --> 2:58:42.840]  Stay there.
[2:58:42.840 --> 2:58:43.840]  It's about $800.
[2:58:43.840 --> 2:58:44.840]  I want to be specific.
[2:58:44.840 --> 2:58:45.840]  It's 77% of our YouTube money.
[2:58:45.840 --> 2:58:46.840]  Yeah, exactly.
[2:58:46.840 --> 2:58:49.680]  But the point is they are literally doing it on purpose.

[3:00:11.640 --> 3:00:16.800]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[3:00:16.800 --> 3:00:20.840]  Unfortunately, all good things come to an end.
[3:00:20.840 --> 3:00:25.720]  Milo is on his dangerous tour with the band book now back in Prennix, where they burn
[3:00:25.720 --> 3:00:26.720]  it.
[3:00:26.720 --> 3:00:27.720]  Milo Yolopoulos joins us.
[3:00:27.720 --> 3:00:30.320]  I'm Alex Jones, and then I'm going to be doing a taped interview with him.
[3:00:30.320 --> 3:00:32.280]  It's going to air later in the week on his YouTube channel.
[3:00:32.280 --> 3:00:36.240]  Nightly News is coming up tonight, but I got Roger Stone in the next segment with big breaking
[3:00:36.240 --> 3:00:37.240]  news.
[3:00:37.240 --> 3:00:39.640]  Let's jam in a few more phone calls here with Milo.
[3:00:39.640 --> 3:00:44.840]  Let's go ahead and talk to Adam and then Ben.
[3:00:44.840 --> 3:00:47.840]  Adam, you're on the air from California.
[3:00:47.840 --> 3:00:50.840]  Hello, Alex and Milo.
[3:00:50.840 --> 3:00:56.080]  I'm a huge fan of InfoWars and Milo, I love your outspoken honesty, especially on the
[3:00:56.080 --> 3:00:58.520]  topic of Jewish control in America.
[3:00:58.520 --> 3:01:01.840]  I don't know if I quite said that, but all right.
[3:01:01.840 --> 3:01:07.600]  Yeah, there's a video of you on the Rubin Report where you say the Jews do run everything.
[3:01:07.600 --> 3:01:10.120]  You're vastly overrepresented in the media in banking.
[3:01:10.120 --> 3:01:15.120]  Well, yeah, I know what I think, yes, yes.
[3:01:15.120 --> 3:01:16.120]  Okay, let's let him respond.
[3:01:16.120 --> 3:01:17.120]  Thank you, Adam.
[3:01:17.120 --> 3:01:18.120]  Go ahead.
[3:01:18.120 --> 3:01:20.880]  No, I think we were talking about anti-Semitism, and I said, well, one example of something
[3:01:20.880 --> 3:01:26.080]  that is not anti-Semitic is merely pointing out that we as Jews are vastly overrepresented
[3:01:26.080 --> 3:01:30.120]  in industries perceived to be powerful, like the media and like banking, and that is perfectly
[3:01:30.120 --> 3:01:31.760]  true and not an anti-Semitic observation.
[3:01:31.760 --> 3:01:33.440]  So that was the point we were making in that show.
[3:01:33.440 --> 3:01:37.520]  I mean, my deal is a lot of the anti-Jew crowd, they attribute magical powers.
[3:01:37.520 --> 3:01:40.520]  They're always saying everything I have is Jewish, and Jews tell me what to do.
[3:01:40.520 --> 3:01:45.400]  And it's just like, it's just an excuse for people not to be successful.
[3:01:45.400 --> 3:01:48.840]  And they do the same thing that the left, you know, that the Democrat Party does with
[3:01:48.840 --> 3:01:51.520]  Russia, that the left does with the straight white male patriarchy.
[3:01:51.520 --> 3:01:53.520]  I think there's a certain...
[3:01:53.520 --> 3:01:54.520]  Exactly.
[3:01:54.520 --> 3:01:55.520]  The Russians made me successful.
[3:01:55.520 --> 3:01:56.520]  I think there's...
[3:01:56.520 --> 3:01:57.520]  Or the Jews...
[3:01:57.520 --> 3:02:02.440]  Some people do the same thing with Jews, and it's just as intellectually unsatisfying
[3:02:02.440 --> 3:02:03.440]  when they do it.
[3:02:03.440 --> 3:02:04.440]  Actually, it just gets old.
[3:02:04.440 --> 3:02:05.440]  Yeah.
[3:02:05.440 --> 3:02:08.960]  I mean, you know, and personally, I've experienced it.
[3:02:08.960 --> 3:02:14.160]  If somebody falls on a banana peel, I mean, it gets a little old, but I'll let the caller
[3:02:14.160 --> 3:02:15.160]  get on and talk about it.
[3:02:15.160 --> 3:02:19.920]  Let's go ahead and talk to Ben in Pennsylvania, you're on the air with Milo.
[3:02:19.920 --> 3:02:21.920]  Hey, guys.
[3:02:21.920 --> 3:02:24.920]  Hey, buddy.
[3:02:24.920 --> 3:02:31.320]  First of all, first thing I want to say is Caveman, John Oliver needs to try that because
[3:02:31.320 --> 3:02:35.520]  that little twat has obviously been shoved in the locker way too much and he was in school.
[3:02:35.520 --> 3:02:37.040]  You can tell from the face, can't you?
[3:02:37.040 --> 3:02:40.840]  You can tell that's a face that's been jammed against a wall.
[3:02:40.840 --> 3:02:41.840]  Well, probably...
[3:02:41.840 --> 3:02:45.440]  You're the guy I think you have been, at least not without you wanting to...
[3:02:45.440 --> 3:02:46.440]  Well, only consensually.
[3:02:46.440 --> 3:02:47.440]  No.
[3:02:47.440 --> 3:02:48.440]  Sorry.
[3:02:48.440 --> 3:02:49.440]  Carry on.
[3:02:49.440 --> 3:02:52.000]  But yeah, Caveman's phenomenal.
[3:02:52.000 --> 3:02:55.200]  Put that in milk or almond milk, and it's fantastic.
[3:02:55.200 --> 3:02:56.200]  It does the trick.
[3:02:56.200 --> 3:02:57.200]  It takes away anything.
[3:02:57.200 --> 3:03:01.200]  I have a bad urge to snack, but whenever I have that, I take some Caveman and I'm good.
[3:03:01.200 --> 3:03:08.080]  But the topic I wanted to get to is Milo, you touched on it a little bit with left-wing
[3:03:08.080 --> 3:03:13.840]  gay being so against Trump, it blows my mind.
[3:03:13.840 --> 3:03:20.840]  I got an argument at work the other day with Issella, he's a gay man, and he was offended
[3:03:20.840 --> 3:03:26.000]  by the fact that I have an Info Wars Trump sticker on my bumper.
[3:03:26.000 --> 3:03:29.240]  And he just said, you know, I didn't know that you could be so anti-gay.
[3:03:29.240 --> 3:03:30.640]  And I was like, are you kidding me?
[3:03:30.640 --> 3:03:34.280]  I think Donald Trump is probably the most gay friendly character we've ever had.
[3:03:34.280 --> 3:03:36.280]  You can see how homophobic Alex Jones is at this very moment.
[3:03:36.280 --> 3:03:38.280]  Here's to freedom of speech.
[3:03:38.280 --> 3:03:39.280]  Cheers.
[3:03:39.280 --> 3:03:41.640]  Ah, this is a delicious Jewish-made drink.
[3:03:41.640 --> 3:03:42.640]  Stop it.
[3:03:42.640 --> 3:03:43.640]  You're gonna say that's anti-semitic.
[3:03:43.640 --> 3:03:44.640]  Stop it.
[3:03:44.640 --> 3:03:45.640]  I'm making jokes at the anti-Semite.
[3:03:45.640 --> 3:03:46.640]  Stop it.
[3:03:46.640 --> 3:03:47.640]  That's gonna be extracted out for something.
[3:03:47.640 --> 3:03:48.640]  I'm sorry, caller.
[3:03:48.640 --> 3:03:49.640]  Go ahead.
[3:03:49.640 --> 3:03:50.640]  Let's see.
[3:03:50.640 --> 3:03:51.640]  I mean, if you're making...
[3:03:51.640 --> 3:03:53.640]  I don't know if you can see the screen, is it?
[3:03:53.640 --> 3:03:58.200]  I don't know if you can see the screen, but we're drinking Cosmos while you're talking
[3:03:58.200 --> 3:04:01.200]  about how homophobic it was.
[3:04:01.200 --> 3:04:06.200]  We're kissing with pink Cosmos.
[3:04:06.200 --> 3:04:12.360]  You're probably drinking such a high-end drink because I have Jewish heritage and it's because
[3:04:12.360 --> 3:04:13.360]  of me.
[3:04:13.360 --> 3:04:14.360]  Oh, that's true.
[3:04:14.360 --> 3:04:15.360]  You did it all, huh?
[3:04:15.360 --> 3:04:16.360]  Exactly.
[3:04:16.360 --> 3:04:17.360]  No, but seriously, Ben, I apologize for not arguing.
[3:04:17.360 --> 3:04:18.360]  Go ahead.
[3:04:18.360 --> 3:04:19.360]  Finish your point.
[3:04:19.360 --> 3:04:20.360]  It just...
[3:04:20.360 --> 3:04:25.040]  I was just saying, I argued with this guy and it didn't get very far because my belief
[3:04:25.040 --> 3:04:28.760]  is liberalism is a legitimate mental disorder and you can't really argue with them because
[3:04:28.760 --> 3:04:30.360]  it's like picking on the special kid in school.
[3:04:30.360 --> 3:04:31.360]  Well, that's very compassionate.
[3:04:31.360 --> 3:04:33.560]  This could be chilled a bit more.
[3:04:33.560 --> 3:04:35.560]  You know, I think maybe two, three degrees.
[3:04:35.560 --> 3:04:37.560]  So we need to chill the Vakamor.
[3:04:37.560 --> 3:04:38.560]  Maybe a little bit.
[3:04:38.560 --> 3:04:39.560]  Yeah.
[3:04:39.560 --> 3:04:40.560]  It's good, then.
[3:04:40.560 --> 3:04:42.920]  Yeah, well, I mean, hey, it's good celebrating Madam President.
[3:04:42.920 --> 3:04:43.920]  Here's to Madam President.
[3:04:43.920 --> 3:04:44.920]  Madam President.
[3:04:44.920 --> 3:04:45.920]  Oh.
[3:04:45.920 --> 3:04:46.920]  Here's to you, though.
[3:04:46.920 --> 3:04:47.920]  Here's to First Lady.
[3:04:47.920 --> 3:04:48.920]  Oh.
[3:04:48.920 --> 3:04:54.760]  Here is to your book, Back From the Dead, back to number one, Dangerous.
[3:04:54.760 --> 3:04:56.760]  We have a week four on The New York Times best of all of us.
[3:04:56.760 --> 3:04:57.760]  We salute you, my friend.
[3:04:57.760 --> 3:04:58.760]  Well done.
[3:04:58.760 --> 3:04:59.760]  Well done.
[3:04:59.760 --> 3:05:00.760]  We'll be back.
[3:05:00.760 --> 3:05:07.520]  A 44-year-old father was beat by gang of teenagers and knocked out with a skateboard after he
[3:05:07.520 --> 3:05:10.880]  asked them to stop smoking marijuana on a Dallas train.
[3:05:10.880 --> 3:05:14.480]  The group of teenagers included young men and women who punched the father and threw them
[3:05:14.480 --> 3:05:19.320]  against the train's doors before arriving at the station near Deep Ellum in Dallas, Texas.
[3:05:19.320 --> 3:05:25.040]  In world news, 22.5% of the German population now has a migrant background.
[3:05:25.040 --> 3:05:29.920]  Migrants and their children make up an estimated 18.6 million people in Germany.
[3:05:29.920 --> 3:05:33.680]  According to the Federal Statistical Office, which attributed the shocking statistic to
[3:05:33.680 --> 3:05:38.120]  German Chancellor Angela Merkel and her open border policies.
[3:05:38.120 --> 3:05:42.320]  In contrast, President Trump plans to overhaul immigration laws in America as part of his
[3:05:42.320 --> 3:05:45.720]  wide-ranging agenda to tighten border security.
[3:05:45.720 --> 3:05:50.080]  The president is working with two senators to draft a bill to create a skills-based immigration
[3:05:50.080 --> 3:05:55.000]  program that gives priority to Americans by cutting down on work visa abuse, among other
[3:05:55.000 --> 3:05:56.000]  things.

[3:06:00.320 --> 3:06:02.520]  This is Kid Daniels reporting.
[3:06:02.520 --> 3:06:06.040]  After being sold out for months, our best-selling Super Blue fluoride toothpaste is now back
[3:06:06.040 --> 3:06:07.880]  in stock at infowarstore.com.
[3:06:07.880 --> 3:06:10.680]  The first shipment of Super Blue sold out in one week.
[3:06:10.680 --> 3:06:12.760]  I thought it would be a six-month supply for listeners.
[3:06:12.760 --> 3:06:17.000]  And since then, people are beating down our doors, wanting to be able to resupply their
[3:06:17.000 --> 3:06:18.000]  Super Blue.
[3:06:18.000 --> 3:06:19.880]  Research across the board is clear.
[3:06:19.880 --> 3:06:21.240]  In fact, it's certified.
[3:06:21.240 --> 3:06:25.120]  When bacteria infect your gums, it can enter your bloodstream, and even contribute to blood
[3:06:25.120 --> 3:06:26.120]  clots and heart attacks.
[3:06:26.120 --> 3:06:30.840]  That's why the last Surgeon General's report on oral health warns that your oral health
[3:06:30.840 --> 3:06:33.480]  can have a serious impact on your entire body.
[3:06:33.480 --> 3:06:36.640]  Super Blue fluoride-free toothpaste is a groundbreaking new formula that's loaded with
[3:06:36.640 --> 3:06:39.840]  good halogen iodide, some of the bad halogen fluoride.
[3:06:39.840 --> 3:06:44.400]  Super Blue contains natural oils and ingredients used since biblical times to help wipe out
[3:06:44.400 --> 3:06:46.840]  bad bacteria and eliminate bad breath.
[3:06:46.840 --> 3:06:51.240]  Just some of the ingredients in Super Blue chosen by our dental experts include xylitol,
[3:06:51.240 --> 3:06:54.360]  peppermint oil, iodide, nano silver, and more.

[3:07:16.600 --> 3:07:17.600]  core.
[3:07:17.600 --> 3:07:21.600]  Nearly every other selenium supplement on the market is produced with synthetic selenium.
[3:07:21.600 --> 3:07:26.720]  The Biotrusillinium is made from a source of 100% organic mustard seed.
[3:07:26.720 --> 3:07:30.240]  The effects of the essential trace mineral selenium are well known.
[3:07:30.240 --> 3:07:35.280]  From supporting the thyroid gland and immune system to DNA production and eyesight, Biotrusillinium
[3:07:35.280 --> 3:07:40.440]  is also the perfect supercharger to survival shield X2 nascent iodide as both help support
[3:07:40.440 --> 3:07:42.480]  a healthy thyroid and many other systems.

[3:08:21.500 --> 3:08:28.500]  This message is transmitted at the request with the president of the United States of America and the Office of Homeland Security.
[3:08:28.500 --> 3:08:33.500]  In compliance with the United Nations, the president of the United States has declared martial law.
[3:08:33.500 --> 3:08:53.500]  Curfew is now in place. Return to your homes. We have to walk people outside of your homes. We will be arrested on site.
[3:08:53.500 --> 3:09:00.500]  U.N. peacekeeping comparisons have severed all data transmissions and telephone communications for national security.
[3:09:00.500 --> 3:09:13.500]  Any violation of martial law will result in immediate arrests and trial for treason. All traitors will be shot. America is now engaged in civil war.
[3:09:13.500 --> 3:09:18.500]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[3:09:18.500 --> 3:09:24.500]  It's Alex Jones.
[3:09:24.500 --> 3:09:34.500]  I catch myself saying this on air more often. I've been on there 22 years and previously, maybe every two or three years, I would say this is the most important broadcast I've ever done.
[3:09:34.500 --> 3:09:49.500]  Because as time goes on, bigger and bigger events happen, the acceleration of technology, the compacting of time as we move towards the singularity, things are getting more intense.
[3:09:49.500 --> 3:09:59.500]  There isn't an historian. There isn't an analyst. There isn't a futurist out there that disagrees with that fact.
[3:09:59.500 --> 3:10:09.500]  Knowledge is increasing. Populations are increasing. Crises are intensifying. But I've never gotten on air with something as big as this.
[3:10:09.500 --> 3:10:26.500]  When you look at the constellation of facts, we have world leaders like Al Gore and Brennan formerly of the CIA, the director and others, Clapper,
[3:10:26.500 --> 3:10:31.500]  on the same program together last week with Wolf Blitzer talking about removing the president.
[3:10:31.500 --> 3:10:37.500]  And Blitzer says, you mean impeachment? They go, no, we're going to just remove him. It's about to happen the next few months.
[3:10:37.500 --> 3:10:40.500]  And everybody needs to get behind it so there's not a civil war.
[3:10:40.500 --> 3:10:46.500]  While they call for a civil war and violence everywhere.
[3:10:46.500 --> 3:10:56.500]  Then I get in contact with some of my sources in DC yesterday and of course a few weeks ago we had the pastor on who met with Trump, Pastor Brown, a top of Angelical,
[3:10:56.500 --> 3:11:00.500]  at the big prayer meeting two weeks ago and then he was in a congressional meeting all day.
[3:11:00.500 --> 3:11:07.500]  And top congressman told him they're shopping martial law and the removal of the president, the killing of the president.
[3:11:07.500 --> 3:11:12.500]  And he's confirmed now, talking to the congressman again, it's the killing.
[3:11:12.500 --> 3:11:20.500]  The secret service visited him and said, who's the congressman? And he said to the secret service, it's all over the news. It's Al Gore.
[3:11:20.500 --> 3:11:26.500]  It's Brennan. They're all saying they're going to remove the president. They're in major publications saying killing.
[3:11:26.500 --> 3:11:32.500]  They're saying hashtag hunt Republicans, top Democrat strategists. They're funding cop killer groups.
[3:11:32.500 --> 3:11:39.500]  And CNN says when a cop gets randomly shot, well, cops better be good people and they'll stop getting shot in the back.
[3:11:39.500 --> 3:11:43.500]  I'm not just a pure defender of the police. When they do something wrong, I'll speak out.
[3:11:43.500 --> 3:11:51.500]  But I don't just randomly say go kill cops because some other cop might have done something in another state. That's crazy.
[3:11:51.500 --> 3:11:55.500]  So they're trying to bring this country into anarchy so they can turn us in another.
[3:11:55.500 --> 3:12:01.500]  Venezuela or North Korea and Roger Stone. I talked to Roger Stone last night. He contacted me via text.
[3:12:01.500 --> 3:12:10.500]  I contacted him back and he said this is seven days in May, which of course is a famous 1960s film with Kurt Douglas and Burt Lancaster.
[3:12:10.500 --> 3:12:14.500]  It's excellent dealing with generals and an attempted coup.
[3:12:14.500 --> 3:12:19.500]  And we see the Democrats. Limbaugh talked about it last week are shopping to generals, a coup against Trump.
[3:12:19.500 --> 3:12:29.500]  So I've talked to him at length. And since this morning, we've been mulling what we can get into here on air because I have my sources in the Pentagon,
[3:12:29.500 --> 3:12:39.500]  my sources in Congress, my sources in the judiciary, my sources in army special operations, all telling me the same thing.
[3:12:39.500 --> 3:12:48.500]  Then I talked to him and he's telling me even more important information that is congruent with this from very high level sources.
[3:12:48.500 --> 3:12:53.500]  And a lot of times we sit on info and never release it because we don't want to give up sources.
[3:12:53.500 --> 3:13:03.500]  But at a certain point when the president's being isolated ahead of a coup and being treated like he's a child, it's treasonous.
[3:13:03.500 --> 3:13:13.500]  Now, no sooner had I hung the phone up last night that one of the things we discussed popped up on Politico because they never hold back what they know.
[3:13:13.500 --> 3:13:18.500]  And it's Kelly. Kelly cracks down on West Wing back channels to Trump.
[3:13:18.500 --> 3:13:26.500]  The new Winehouse Heat with Staff is making its first priority to gain control of the information that gets to the president.
[3:13:26.500 --> 3:13:30.500]  By the way, Anthony Kumiya hosts the show every two weeks as his own great compound media.
[3:13:30.500 --> 3:13:34.500]  He has given us the first 30 minutes that they'll be popping in towards the end of this 30 minutes.
[3:13:34.500 --> 3:13:37.500]  But he was happy to give us his time. This is the only time he could get Roger on.
[3:13:37.500 --> 3:13:42.500]  So I appreciate Anthony Kumiya riding shotgun. Well, this is the great work he does. So he'll be popping in.
[3:13:42.500 --> 3:13:44.500]  We'll go a little bit longer than 30 minutes if we need to.
[3:13:44.500 --> 3:13:50.500]  But that's the facts here. And then Kelly's reportedly quoted saying, yeah, you know, Trump believes whatever he's first given.
[3:13:50.500 --> 3:13:53.500]  Like he thought he was being wiretapped by Obama, which he never was.
[3:13:53.500 --> 3:13:57.500]  They were all over the newspapers saying they were wiretapping him. They were on CNN saying they were doing it.
[3:13:57.500 --> 3:14:00.500]  Then when Trump said that's illegal, they went, we never said that.
[3:14:00.500 --> 3:14:07.500]  So they quote things that Trump's doing that Trump's supposedly wrong about that are admittedly true.
[3:14:07.500 --> 3:14:15.500]  Then they got McMaster firing people that say globalism is allied with Islam to flood our borders when the UN admits that.
[3:14:15.500 --> 3:14:21.500]  So Trump is the real deal, but he's drawing from the swamp to drain the swamp.
[3:14:21.500 --> 3:14:25.500]  Kind of like Treasure Island. You go out to get a ship to take you to find treasure.
[3:14:25.500 --> 3:14:27.500]  The problem is the pirates know before you what you're doing.
[3:14:27.500 --> 3:14:31.500]  They are the folks showing up to help you crew the ship.
[3:14:31.500 --> 3:14:35.500]  So it's Treasure Island. You got a few people in the White House that are good guys.
[3:14:35.500 --> 3:14:38.500]  Everybody else is led by Long John Silver.
[3:14:38.500 --> 3:14:44.500]  Now, who is the Long John Silver now that previous and now that others are gone?
[3:14:44.500 --> 3:14:47.500]  We're going to talk about that with Roger Stone and see how much he'll tell you.
[3:14:47.500 --> 3:14:50.500]  We're skipping this break coming up because there may not be a show soon, folks.
[3:14:50.500 --> 3:14:53.500]  They have this coup of Trump. They're coming after everybody else.
[3:14:53.500 --> 3:14:59.500]  And at that point, we have no choice but to defend the Republic because they're not going to give us quarter.
[3:14:59.500 --> 3:15:01.500]  They want to extinguish the Republic forever.
[3:15:01.500 --> 3:15:05.500]  Roger Stone, thank you for joining us. The most important transmission ever so far.
[3:15:05.500 --> 3:15:09.500]  I'm sure we'll just get more intense in the weeks and days to come, but we are on the razor's edge.
[3:15:09.500 --> 3:15:11.500]  Please break it down.
[3:15:11.500 --> 3:15:15.500]  Well, Alex, like you, I had a sleepless night.
[3:15:15.500 --> 3:15:20.500]  As you know, Donald Trump ran for president as a non-interventionist.
[3:15:20.500 --> 3:15:31.500]  When his generals, Mattis, Kelly, and McMasters recommended 150,000 ground troops for Syria,
[3:15:31.500 --> 3:15:43.500]  on the tail end of what many believe was a false flag use of chemical weapons in Syria allegedly by Assad, pardon me.
[3:15:43.500 --> 3:15:53.500]  And what I think has happened here in the effort to oust Priebus and Spicer in the establishment Republicans
[3:15:53.500 --> 3:15:57.500]  who were essentially junior leaders to the deep state.
[3:15:57.500 --> 3:16:03.500]  We've had, in essence, what I think is a soft coup in progress.
[3:16:03.500 --> 3:16:15.500]  Now, the reason I say this is because a source at the very highest level of the administration tells me that Kelly seeks to choke off all communications
[3:16:15.500 --> 3:16:22.500]  between the president and his associates, friends, and many supporters.
[3:16:22.500 --> 3:16:34.500]  Secondarily, that the generals, Kelly, McMaster, and Mattis have agreed that no two of them will be out of town at the same time.
[3:16:34.500 --> 3:16:38.500]  In other words, like the president needs to be babysat.
[3:16:38.500 --> 3:16:49.500]  And quite incredibly, that any military order given by the president must have the unanimous notification and approval of the three generals.
[3:16:49.500 --> 3:16:52.500]  That borders on the treasonous.
[3:16:52.500 --> 3:16:59.500]  At a minimum, it is the usurpation of civilian control of government that was vested in Donald Trump.
[3:16:59.500 --> 3:17:03.500]  Donald Trump does not need to be babysat.
[3:17:03.500 --> 3:17:05.500]  He is not incontinent.
[3:17:05.500 --> 3:17:10.500]  He has won the greatest election victory, perhaps, in American history.
[3:17:10.500 --> 3:17:20.500]  Plus, the law says he's the commander-in-chief. The law says those generals will execute his orders.
[3:17:20.500 --> 3:17:27.500]  By this morning, a lot of it was starting to already come out, which shows how we've got to start going on air the minute we learn this stuff.
[3:17:27.500 --> 3:17:31.500]  Well, look, there is, as you know, some precedence for this.
[3:17:31.500 --> 3:17:47.500]  General Alexander Haig and the Defense Secretary James Schlesinger essentially had a pact that any military order given by President Richard Nixon in the closing days of his administration would have to be approved by them.
[3:17:47.500 --> 3:17:49.500]  They were also usurping.
[3:17:49.500 --> 3:18:01.500]  And the words at the final days of Nixon, they're behaving like these are the things you do, cutting off the info, removing the powers. They're already rendering him gilded.
[3:18:01.500 --> 3:18:07.500]  At least they're trying. They're already cutting off his appendages ahead of the big event.
[3:18:07.500 --> 3:18:10.500]  Well, let me go one step further, Alex.
[3:18:10.500 --> 3:18:21.500]  And that is, while it is true that previous ran too lucrative, I'm not suggesting that anybody should be able to get through to the president.
[3:18:21.500 --> 3:18:27.500]  But I do think that he cannot be cut off from some of his most trusted aides and supporters.
[3:18:27.500 --> 3:18:31.500]  And the president is a naturally inquisitive chief executive.
[3:18:31.500 --> 3:18:37.500]  During the campaign, he would pick up the phone and call individual state directors to check on how the campaign was going.
[3:18:37.500 --> 3:18:50.500]  But you will recall that H.R. Bob Haldeman and his psychic, John Ehrlichman, very carefully isolated Nixon, pre-Watergate, to the point that cabinet members could not get through.
[3:18:50.500 --> 3:18:57.500]  And they use the paranoia about leakers to get him to actually do the things they finally removed him with.
[3:18:57.500 --> 3:19:03.500]  That is absolutely the case. That isolation, I think, led to Watergate.
[3:19:03.500 --> 3:19:13.500]  In other words, there is a happy medium. The door should just not be open and nobody wanders into the Oval Office who feels like it, as it was under Mr. Pribis.
[3:19:13.500 --> 3:19:18.500]  But on the other hand, the generals seek to totally control information.
[3:19:18.500 --> 3:19:25.500]  Well, Roger, I think obviously somebody needs to know this. I don't know how much we can say, but let's stop me if you need to.
[3:19:25.500 --> 3:19:37.500]  But the president calls people, has hour-long conversations with them, says, send the data here, and then the data via email, via phone, is literally misdirected somewhere else.
[3:19:37.500 --> 3:19:46.500]  And then you confirm, someone confirms to the president that this is indeed his number that he's gotten, but that they have used the NSA to hijack it.
[3:19:46.500 --> 3:19:52.500]  And then we have Kelly in the middle of it saying he's going to cut people off from the president.
[3:19:52.500 --> 3:19:57.500]  Now, I mean, I really think the information you've got is too dangerous not to go ahead and release.
[3:19:57.500 --> 3:20:01.500]  I'm just telling you, my spider sense says we need to release it.
[3:20:01.500 --> 3:20:09.500]  Well, Alex, let me say this. Everything I have, you have said I have heard to be anecdotally true.
[3:20:09.500 --> 3:20:18.500]  More than one person has told me that they were instructed to send things to the president, but that they could not get the information to him.
[3:20:18.500 --> 3:20:25.500]  But here, more importantly, are the things specifically that the president has not been briefed on.
[3:20:25.500 --> 3:20:41.500]  He has not been briefed on the super secret FISA court decision of November that absolutely proves that the Obama administration was surveilling tens of thousands of Americans for political purposes.
[3:20:41.500 --> 3:20:47.500]  Something Mr. Brennan and Mr. Clapper and Ms. Rice, and yes, Obama are up to their knees in.
[3:20:47.500 --> 3:20:52.500]  So this is Watergate Square to infinity. But the good news is I hear Trump has been briefed now.
[3:20:52.500 --> 3:21:08.500]  Well, let's hope that is the case. Let me go on. The president was is not been briefed on the case against Sheriff Joe Arpaio has not been told about the egregious misconduct of the Justice Department under Barack Obama in that case.
[3:21:08.500 --> 3:21:19.500]  The president has not been briefed about the secret grand jury currently assessing whether they can cook up an indictment against the journalist Julian Assange.
[3:21:19.500 --> 3:21:33.500]  The president has not been briefed on the plan of Jeff Sessions and Chris Christie with the support of General Kelly to crack down on medicinal marijuana in the states.
[3:21:33.500 --> 3:21:46.500]  I worked for Donald Trump for 40 years. I know that hell is to be paid when he is not told the necessary information or when information you give him is incomplete.
[3:21:46.500 --> 3:21:58.500]  He likes to know everything before he makes decisions. As I've said many times on this show, my experience is when he has all the information, he almost always makes the right decision.
[3:21:58.500 --> 3:22:09.500]  Let me stop you, Roger. That's my next point. You read the political article and others. They say they're getting this from Kelly. This is basically a leak where the president believes whatever he's given, which is not true.
[3:22:09.500 --> 3:22:20.500]  And so he's got to restrict it as a gatekeeper. They're openly acting like the president's addled. And again, they give the example. The president believed the news he was given from Breitbart.
[3:22:20.500 --> 3:22:29.500]  I'm just going to direct the text on Vannon that Obama was spying on his campaign. Obama's people went on TV during the campaign and said it. They said it when he was president-elect.
[3:22:29.500 --> 3:22:39.500]  They said it 22 times the New York Times in the month of January. We've shown the actual newspapers and they just said they have communiques of Sessions talking to Russians last week.
[3:22:39.500 --> 3:22:47.500]  So they're saying he's crazy because he believed Breitbart. He's now the president. He knows he was spied on.
[3:22:47.500 --> 3:22:58.500]  He knows what the FBI was doing. He knows all this. So again, they're playing these games. What is Kelly doing? What is this? Or are they lying?
[3:22:58.500 --> 3:23:07.500]  Because we have the intel. This is going on. He's cutting folks off. But Politico has him criticizing the president. I guess the president isn't seeing this.
[3:23:07.500 --> 3:23:19.500]  And that's why they don't want him having access to the internet. All he's got is Sean Hannity now. Let's just say it. A few people he talks to on the phone, like you occasionally, and Sean Hannity who he religiously watches.
[3:23:19.500 --> 3:23:28.500]  That's why Sean Hannity after Trump is one of the most important people in America now because he gets it. He understands it and Trump watches him.
[3:23:28.500 --> 3:23:38.500]  So we've all got a lobby Hannity and Lou Dobbs to keep hammering the truth of the plan coup. Because again, we just sit here calmly with all these people on TV.
[3:23:38.500 --> 3:23:48.500]  Brennan Gore saying they're about to overthrow Trump, that they're shopping into generals. We have the generals cutting Trump's access off. I mean, this is textbook preparation for coup.
[3:23:48.500 --> 3:24:03.500]  This is indeed a crude version of seven days in May. Alex, let me stress a couple things that the FISA document not being revealed to the president is shielding the deep state.
[3:24:03.500 --> 3:24:19.500]  The last thing the generals want is to see the indictment of Brennan Rogers, Rice, Rhodes, presumably Jarrett and Obama et al. So they're covering for their deep state brethren.
[3:24:19.500 --> 3:24:38.500]  I believe now that Steve Bannon has assisted the generals in taking power and played sadly an instrumental role in the ousting of Anthony Scaramucci. I suspect the generals will find Steve's nationalist and non-interventionist views problematic.
[3:24:38.500 --> 3:24:44.500]  And my guess is that it's only a matter of time before the generals move on him too.
[3:24:44.500 --> 3:24:54.500]  I was about to say that's my next piece. Policy-wise, Bannon's done a good job with Trump and Trump's done what he said he'd do. But is that Trump or is that Bannon or is that a mix? That's my question.
[3:24:54.500 --> 3:25:03.500]  Obviously, Trump's very proud that he's been delivering. It's Trump. He likes Bannon because he echoes his own common sense, Americana, populist, nationalist, free market views.
[3:25:03.500 --> 3:25:16.500]  But separately then, who is the Long John Silver? Who's the leader or is it a group still vying? It appears to me it's McMaster who is purging people who are anti-globalist, anti-open border to Islam.
[3:25:16.500 --> 3:25:26.500]  It appears more and more McMaster is some type of Soros bot. I mean, he appears to have the Soros stamp.
[3:25:26.500 --> 3:25:37.500]  Well, but Alex, the other thing I tell you is that General Kelly brought with him from Homeland Security, a woman named Kristen Nielsen.
[3:25:37.500 --> 3:25:46.500]  Kristen Nielsen's role at Homeland Security was ensuring that no one who was loyal and worked for Donald Trump or his election was hired.
[3:25:46.500 --> 3:25:56.500]  She was a never-Trumper to the bitter end. She's now going over as deputy White House chief of staff where she will presumably play the same role.
[3:25:56.500 --> 3:25:59.500]  This is a Trump White House staff with no Trumpers.
[3:25:59.500 --> 3:26:11.500]  So what we see happening is, they've got some mild flip-floppers like Priebus and Spicer playing both sides, weak people but still articulate and decent in some ways.
[3:26:11.500 --> 3:26:19.500]  Then we get a Scaramucci hardcore patriot. They magnify his few mistakes, spoof him, e-mails, calls. We're trying to really take action.
[3:26:19.500 --> 3:26:25.500]  Trump ejects him under pressure and then we get real deep staters taking control.
[3:26:25.500 --> 3:26:38.500]  What was done to Scaramucci is really extraordinary. Despite the fact that he took and passed as his mandatory two drug tests before going to work at the White House, the rumor was spread that he was a drug user.
[3:26:38.500 --> 3:26:44.500]  He's never used drugs in his life. They do that to me because I have energy. They say Trump's on drugs because he has energy.
[3:26:44.500 --> 3:26:53.500]  Lies were told about his personal life. Lies were told connecting him in romantic relationships that did not exist.
[3:26:53.500 --> 3:27:02.500]  He was followed by government agents. This was a classic deep state takedown. What was Scaramucci's sin?
[3:27:02.500 --> 3:27:08.500]  He's not a deep stator. He's committed to the Trump agenda, not the general's agenda.
[3:27:08.500 --> 3:27:17.500]  I'm confident that his greatest days of public service may yet be ahead of him. He knows how to make money.
[3:27:17.500 --> 3:27:24.500]  The sale of his company will be done shortly and he'll be awash in hundreds of millions of dollars.
[3:27:24.500 --> 3:27:32.500]  But what we have here is a slow motion deep state coup. They will block any move on Comey or Mueller.
[3:27:32.500 --> 3:27:40.500]  They will isolate the president so he doesn't see the blade coming. They will slow motion walk him into the 18 election.
[3:27:40.500 --> 3:27:51.500]  They're going to wrap the Republican Congress around his neck when frankly the president can very easily rebound by starting to challenge establishment Republicans and primaries.
[3:27:51.500 --> 3:28:00.500]  The president wants to send a shot her around the world, go to Alabama and get Jeff Sessions Senate seat for a Trump supporter.
[3:28:00.500 --> 3:28:09.500]  Someone who pledges to support the president to the bitter end, not Mitch McConnell's establishment Republican candidate, Luther Strange.
[3:28:09.500 --> 3:28:10.500]  That's right. Let me paraphrase.
[3:28:10.500 --> 3:28:12.500]  That's the shot heard around the world.
[3:28:12.500 --> 3:28:15.500]  I agree. Let me paraphrase here.
[3:28:15.500 --> 3:28:29.500]  It's a Churchill. Men and women are not generally made by even overall who they are, but by the times they live in and then responding and meeting that measure or surpassing it.
[3:28:29.500 --> 3:28:36.500]  We are seeing open globalist war against everything basic and honest. We're seeing the most radical elements of Islam pouring in.
[3:28:36.500 --> 3:28:41.500]  We're seeing attacks on the family. We're seeing attacks on our stock market, attacks on our economy.
[3:28:41.500 --> 3:28:50.500]  It's so clear we're seeing open calls to kill our president, to arrest us, to shut down the free press, total censorship coming into play.
[3:28:50.500 --> 3:29:00.500]  I want the audience to understand I don't have words to describe the epic over the top battle we're in and the fact that we're winning when we fight.
[3:29:00.500 --> 3:29:05.500]  So how would you characterize this historic moment we're in, Roger Stone?
[3:29:05.500 --> 3:29:11.500]  It's really clear, Alex. The president has everything at hand to save himself.
[3:29:11.500 --> 3:29:24.500]  He has the skills, the cunning, the information in the FISA court warrant, the powerful issue of building the wall and what is already booming as an economy.
[3:29:24.500 --> 3:29:35.500]  They hope to lull him to sleep before he realizes that he can still destroy the deep state and lead in the direction that he delineated in the election.
[3:29:35.500 --> 3:29:41.500]  Wow, let's come in and have final comments and some questions by Anthony Comey of Compound Media and the great work he does.
[3:29:41.500 --> 3:29:45.500]  Straight ahead, Anthony Comey will have some key questions. Straight ahead, please stay with us, Roger Stone.
[3:29:45.500 --> 3:29:57.500]  We're on the march. The Empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[3:30:16.500 --> 3:30:24.500]  Yeah, fungus is a growing epidemic and I've been testing this formula and making changes to this formula for over 10 years.
[3:30:24.500 --> 3:30:29.500]  It's available at informerstore.com. We also have free shipping orders. $50 or more and 10% off.
[3:30:29.500 --> 3:30:34.500]  We sign up for auto ship additionally on top of that. Please, we only have a limited supply of this.
[3:30:34.500 --> 3:30:37.500]  I want to get your reviews on here what you have to say for me. It's been a crow.
[3:30:37.500 --> 3:30:45.500]  MycoZX, antifungal, antifungus, anti yeast, get it today, limit it around, it'll be months until we get more.
[3:30:45.500 --> 3:30:49.500]  Informerstore.com and ForwardsLife.com are AAA-253-33139.
[3:30:49.500 --> 3:30:55.500]  I cannot sell something unless it helps somebody and you can't support an organization that didn't fight in order.
[3:30:55.500 --> 3:31:01.500]  Look at the response we're getting. We ever changed the world together. You are the Info War. God bless you all.
[3:31:01.500 --> 3:31:08.500]  It's not just our water we need to filter. It's not just our food that needs to be cleaned. It's the air we're breathing, especially for our children.
[3:31:08.500 --> 3:31:14.500]  The artificial particulates, the chemicals is absolutely weighing down our immune systems.
[3:31:14.500 --> 3:31:23.500]  The same team based right here in America that brought you the Alexa Pure groundbreaking water filtration systems have now developed Alexa Pure Breeze.
[3:31:23.500 --> 3:31:31.500]  Whether it's your home or office, you owe it to yourself, your coworkers, your family, your children, to the best job you can to purify your air.
[3:31:31.500 --> 3:31:39.500]  The elite are masters at poisoning our environment while themselves doing things that mitigate or avoid most of the toxic effects for themselves.
[3:31:39.500 --> 3:31:45.500]  The general public doesn't. The Alexa Pure Breeze will be a steal at $300, $400, $500.
[3:31:45.500 --> 3:31:55.500]  One of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean. This is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house replacing older, more expensive filters that didn't do as good a job.
[3:31:55.500 --> 3:32:01.500]  Find out why this system is so revolutionary today and then FullWarStore.com.
[3:32:01.500 --> 3:32:06.500]  As most of you already know, I am a voracious consumer of news and information.
[3:32:06.500 --> 3:32:19.500]  And in the last four or five years doing more and more research, I came across the fact that the elite establishment is fully aware of the fact that our ancient ancestors in many cases had much better nutrition than we do today.
[3:32:19.500 --> 3:32:26.500]  And our ancient ancestors sought out the bones of the animals that they were hunting, killing, and then processing.
[3:32:26.500 --> 3:32:39.500]  And so I set out to develop Caveman, but to not just have concentrated bone broth from chicken, but seven other superfood ingredients known for cleansing and supercharging the body at the same time.
[3:32:39.500 --> 3:32:49.500]  Info Wars isn't just fighting the globalist. We're getting results and we're expanding in the face of the complete media assault and winning because of your support.
[3:32:49.500 --> 3:33:01.500]  Caveman is finally back at the Info Wars store. You can get 25% off the regular price for a limited time only at infowarslife.com or by calling toll free triple A 253 3139.
[3:33:01.500 --> 3:33:24.500]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance. It's Alex Jones.
[3:33:32.500 --> 3:33:41.500]  Just to keep it coming and put your head up to me because I'm the one that's going to make you burn.
[3:33:41.500 --> 3:33:46.500]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are broadcasting worldwide. Anthony Cooney is such a saint.
[3:33:46.500 --> 3:33:53.500]  I've been courting him to try to, as soon as I launched some stressful radio shows again, which we're about to do with new host, to get him to be a contributor or part of that.
[3:33:53.500 --> 3:34:01.500]  He's got compound media with a lot of great hosts, a lot of great work he does. Be sure and subscribe to that. A lot of it's free, but subscription helps pay for it. It's one of the big corporate funding.
[3:34:01.500 --> 3:34:06.500]  That's compoundmedia.com, amazing host, amazing analysis, and a lot of great humor as well.
[3:34:06.500 --> 3:34:14.500]  He's had one of the top shows on XM, top shows on threshold radio, and has been kicked off and fired for being politically incorrect.
[3:34:14.500 --> 3:34:21.500]  A couple years ago, some people shot cops in the back of the head. He said it was wrong. They fired him off XM off the opening Anthony show.
[3:34:21.500 --> 3:34:29.500]  But he has been really nice because Roger was busy on a plane, couldn't get on until the fourth hour today to let us jump in on him.
[3:34:29.500 --> 3:34:35.500]  He said, hey, take the whole hour. And I said, no, I want to get you in here. I know you've been listening a few minutes, but Roger's been breaking down.
[3:34:35.500 --> 3:34:43.500]  I've got my sources. A lot of this comes from the very top of the White House. You saw, I didn't want to say it because the media make a big deal out of it.
[3:34:43.500 --> 3:34:48.500]  Now they know it's true. They don't give us credit, which is fine. But I don't want to shoot our mouth off here.
[3:34:48.500 --> 3:34:53.500]  But there's a lot of crazy stuff going on right now. And Trump is just counting on the American people.
[3:34:53.500 --> 3:35:01.500]  But what do you make, Anthony? You haven't talked in a few weeks on all of the news, Al Gore, Brennan saying overthrow the president, coup d'etat.
[3:35:01.500 --> 3:35:10.500]  I mean, I know the president doesn't look like a fascist. You're not a fascist. If somebody walks up and puts a gun to your head and you jerk the gun away from them, you're protecting yourself.
[3:35:10.500 --> 3:35:17.500]  What do you think of this and what should the president do? And then ask a few questions of stone and I'm going to turn the rest of this hour over to you, my friend.
[3:35:17.500 --> 3:35:27.500]  Thanks, Alex. I am stunned. Is it a coup supposed to take place kind of secretly? Isn't it supposed to be? There's supposed to be some element of surprise to it.
[3:35:27.500 --> 3:35:36.500]  We have seen this obvious attempt to overthrow this democratically elected president of the United States.
[3:35:36.500 --> 3:35:56.500]  I never thought I'd live in a time in this country where we are absolutely looking at a segment of the society that is hell bent on overthrowing our elected president and inserting a progressive government,
[3:35:56.500 --> 3:36:19.500]  which is, of course, a horribly fascist, oppressive government in its place and having so much support from so many people in this country that were supposed to be, I guess you could call it newscasters, entertainers,
[3:36:19.500 --> 3:36:33.500]  all these people that have the eyes and ears of the American people are completely involved in trying to overthrow this president.
[3:36:33.500 --> 3:36:41.500]  I've seen presidents in past history in this country that have gotten zero cooperation from the other side of the aisle.
[3:36:41.500 --> 3:36:49.500]  We've seen that before. It's a political game that's gone on for as long as this country has been the United States of America.
[3:36:49.500 --> 3:36:57.500]  But one thing I haven't seen is this concerted effort to absolutely remove a president that is so accepted.
[3:36:57.500 --> 3:37:10.500]  I mean, the cause for assassination that you see on social media from people that just are literally asking somebody to eliminate the president with impunity.
[3:37:10.500 --> 3:37:12.500]  Or Madonna saying blow up the White House.
[3:37:12.500 --> 3:37:20.500]  Meanwhile, HR McMaster are letters now out saying let Susan Rice keep her security clearance when she's the one illegally spying on people and giving secrets away.
[3:37:20.500 --> 3:37:24.500]  I mean, it's crazy. They lost. They can't deal with it.
[3:37:24.500 --> 3:37:30.500]  And now what do you make of Al Gore of Brennan saying, oh, a big event's coming.
[3:37:30.500 --> 3:37:32.500]  It's not impatient. We're just going to remove him.
[3:37:32.500 --> 3:37:38.500]  What are they things going to happen if they kill him or are they arrest him outside of law?
[3:37:38.500 --> 3:37:42.500]  What's going to happen, Anthony Cooney? And I want to ask Roger Stone that question.
[3:37:42.500 --> 3:37:47.500]  Oh, man, Alex, I would love to say what would happen is the American people would rise up.
[3:37:47.500 --> 3:37:56.500]  There would be a revolution that is so needed in this country and we get back to what did make this country great again.
[3:37:56.500 --> 3:38:07.500]  But I see too much support from too many people that say and do these things with complete impunity that I'm a little disheartened by the whole thing.
[3:38:07.500 --> 3:38:14.500]  Thinking, unfortunately, that they'll get away with whatever the hell they want to do to this president.
[3:38:14.500 --> 3:38:17.500]  Well, that's the problem. You hit the bell on the head. Coos are done in secret.
[3:38:17.500 --> 3:38:20.500]  It's in a hundred publications or more. I've seen the last month.
[3:38:20.500 --> 3:38:23.500]  Coo, Coo, Coo, kill him, arrest him, put him in a patty wagon.
[3:38:23.500 --> 3:38:27.500]  Stone, three months ago, first predicted, they're going to say he's mentally ill.
[3:38:27.500 --> 3:38:31.500]  Roger, I know you've got to get on to your next report for infowars.com.
[3:38:31.500 --> 3:38:37.500]  We officially worked with infowars as a correspondent. We're launching a show here in just about a month.
[3:38:37.500 --> 3:38:40.500]  We're launching Davids in just about a week and a half roundtable programs.
[3:38:40.500 --> 3:38:46.500]  Your show is going to be the war room, but expanding on that is going to be real news with David Knight.
[3:38:46.500 --> 3:38:51.500]  I mean, this is so surreal. Like, like Anthony was saying, I don't know what to do.
[3:38:51.500 --> 3:38:56.500]  And then they have weird articles going, Jones wants a revolution and to kill people.
[3:38:56.500 --> 3:39:01.500]  They have fake quotes in Newsweek and I'm like, is this real or is it a matrix?
[3:39:01.500 --> 3:39:07.500]  There's fake Newsweek articles about me where I want to kill people and they have fake quotes, but no attribution.
[3:39:07.500 --> 3:39:13.500]  And then they're everywhere saying, kill everybody. What is going on, Roger Stone?
[3:39:13.500 --> 3:39:18.500]  Alex, I'm just reviewing this story you just put up. This is truly extraordinary.
[3:39:18.500 --> 3:39:25.500]  McMaster essentially allowing Susan Rice to keep for top security clearance.
[3:39:25.500 --> 3:39:36.500]  Only this morning it was learned that the unmasking and the use of the surveillance material collected on Republicans and Trump staffers was more extensive than thought as determined.
[3:39:36.500 --> 3:39:43.500]  There's now no doubt McMaster. I asked you who Long John Silver was here on the ship. Isn't it McMaster? Isn't he the leader?
[3:39:43.500 --> 3:39:47.500]  It appears that way. It appears that he is the ringleader.
[3:39:47.500 --> 3:39:49.500]  He's the fifth lord then.
[3:39:49.500 --> 3:39:59.500]  Yes, but it's interesting that he does not have good chemistry with the president, whereas John Kelly, who has a better bedside manner.
[3:39:59.500 --> 3:40:03.500]  So is he the Rasputin? Kelly controls the president, but the master calls the shots?
[3:40:03.500 --> 3:40:10.500]  Well, I actually think you have a triumvirate here. I think that he and Mattis and McMaster are in league.
[3:40:10.500 --> 3:40:19.500]  It's unclear that there's any one senior official. I'm not sure who Al Hague is, but it may well be McMaster.
[3:40:19.500 --> 3:40:22.500]  He is a member of the Council on Foreign Relations.
[3:40:22.500 --> 3:40:37.500]  He is essentially down with the State Department of Rex Tillerson, which is sadly being dominated by former aides to Mitt Romney and, of course, Condoleezza Rice and the Bush people.
[3:40:37.500 --> 3:40:43.500]  And the Trump agenda being sublimated for a mainstream media agenda.
[3:40:43.500 --> 3:40:56.500]  One thing will be very interesting. You'll know for sure how deep the control is this November when the last tranche of JFK assassination documents are scheduled to be released.
[3:40:56.500 --> 3:41:08.500]  I know firsthand that the CIA and the FBI are fighting with the president, arguing that he put it off another 25 years, which he has the authority to do.
[3:41:08.500 --> 3:41:14.500]  The president did allow a small tranche of documents released just last week.
[3:41:14.500 --> 3:41:21.500]  And already scholars are learning a number of things about that period they did not know.
[3:41:21.500 --> 3:41:30.500]  It's incredible to have Susan Rice so discredited with the National Security Clarence and going after Bannon, who thinks he's been playing possum and getting along with these guys.
[3:41:30.500 --> 3:41:38.500]  Again, I'm very nebulous on Bannon because the agenda has been so good so far and so pure in many cases.
[3:41:38.500 --> 3:41:41.500]  And I know a lot of this is Bannon.
[3:41:41.500 --> 3:41:48.500]  And then to watch him, though, playing double games with these guys that would hang him out to dry in a second, I think he's playing a very dangerous game.
[3:41:48.500 --> 3:41:50.500]  What do you think, Roger?
[3:41:50.500 --> 3:42:09.500]  I was very critical of Steve several months ago on this program because, in my view, he would not step up against Jared Kushner and Dina Habib Powell, Gary Cohn and the other, the Goldman Sachs wing, as it were, of the Trump White House.
[3:42:09.500 --> 3:42:16.500]  I kind of backed off my criticism because I think he deserves credit working with the president on Paris.
[3:42:16.500 --> 3:42:23.500]  And he, to his credit, the courts upheld the travel ban and he got that ball rolling for the president.
[3:42:23.500 --> 3:42:30.500]  But this double game of assisting the generals in the hope that they'll eat you last is unrealistic.
[3:42:30.500 --> 3:42:37.500]  You know, I understand Steve would like to, you know, maybe leave under good circumstances and get a great book deal.
[3:42:37.500 --> 3:42:48.500]  And I appreciate that, but he picks his fights and I think he's now paying the extraordinary price for never weighing into the personnel process.
[3:42:48.500 --> 3:42:52.500]  He has no allies because he wouldn't help any Trump person to get hired.
[3:42:52.500 --> 3:42:54.500]  Yeah, absolutely, absolutely.
[3:42:54.500 --> 3:42:55.500]  Because we talk about generals.
[3:42:55.500 --> 3:42:57.500]  Trump loves our military.
[3:42:57.500 --> 3:43:00.500]  Our military is great, but these generals are more political than anybody.
[3:43:00.500 --> 3:43:03.500]  And Trump, I think, is starting to understand that.
[3:43:03.500 --> 3:43:07.500]  Let's bring Anthony Cummings, who's hosting this hour, ComtownMedia.com back in.
[3:43:07.500 --> 3:43:09.500]  Anthony, your perspective.
[3:43:09.500 --> 3:43:17.500]  If one thing happens during this whole disaster that has been watching the curtain being pulled aside,
[3:43:17.500 --> 3:43:25.500]  that will be what history sees as the good thing that has happened during this term.
[3:43:25.500 --> 3:43:28.500]  We are seeing how this machine really works.
[3:43:28.500 --> 3:43:30.500]  We thought there were two sides.
[3:43:30.500 --> 3:43:32.500]  We thought we had Democrats and Republicans.
[3:43:32.500 --> 3:43:37.500]  We thought we had a voice in an election when a regular guy got elected president.
[3:43:37.500 --> 3:43:41.500]  We saw how this machine comes to life and it's one unit.
[3:43:41.500 --> 3:43:46.500]  They're all united in keeping the outsiders out of this machine.
[3:43:46.500 --> 3:43:52.500]  And when we see somebody like Donald Trump try to do things like save our, secure our borders,
[3:43:52.500 --> 3:43:58.500]  make America safe, increase jobs and productivity, keep us a world leader.
[3:43:58.500 --> 3:44:04.500]  This is something that cannot happen and we are seeing the curtain pulled aside
[3:44:04.500 --> 3:44:08.500]  and watching these people try to bring down a president.
[3:44:08.500 --> 3:44:11.500]  You know what you just said is the heart of this.
[3:44:11.500 --> 3:44:13.500]  Trump is for real. Doesn't mean he's perfect.
[3:44:13.500 --> 3:44:15.500]  I can't run my own company half good.
[3:44:15.500 --> 3:44:17.500]  But he is for real.
[3:44:17.500 --> 3:44:19.500]  The results are real. I'm getting chills.
[3:44:19.500 --> 3:44:25.500]  He's this lion under total attack surrounded by all these swamp dwellers that got into power because they kissed.
[3:44:25.500 --> 3:44:32.500]  But not because they were a lion and they better understand that it happened.
[3:44:32.500 --> 3:44:34.500]  Trump is Toto. The American people are Toto.
[3:44:34.500 --> 3:44:35.500]  We pulled the curtain back.
[3:44:35.500 --> 3:44:40.500]  They may destroy a Roger Stoner, Allen Jones and Anthony Cooney and Matt Rudge and Donald Trump.
[3:44:40.500 --> 3:44:45.500]  They're not going to destroy the awakening and they better understand they're fighting with Trump
[3:44:45.500 --> 3:44:47.500]  and don't and are getting their ass kicked.
[3:44:47.500 --> 3:44:50.500]  Imagine they don't get now the curtains back.
[3:44:50.500 --> 3:44:52.500]  Everybody's watching who's conscious.
[3:44:52.500 --> 3:44:56.500]  They're ass hanging out and I'm not just saying that to sound positive.
[3:44:56.500 --> 3:44:59.500]  We all should celebrate that this is bloody. This is painful.
[3:44:59.500 --> 3:45:03.500]  But thank good Lord Jesus, little baby Jesus.
[3:45:03.500 --> 3:45:05.500]  We are finally getting the poison out.
[3:45:05.500 --> 3:45:09.500]  This is a revival of America, Anthony.
[3:45:09.500 --> 3:45:13.500]  I just hope people continue to be motivated, increase the fight.
[3:45:13.500 --> 3:45:18.500]  I mean, it's nice and everything to get on social media and actually speak openly.
[3:45:18.500 --> 3:45:20.500]  Expose yourself to these people.
[3:45:20.500 --> 3:45:22.500]  Let them call you names.
[3:45:22.500 --> 3:45:28.500]  If they're calling you names, it means you're doing the job that needs to be done by these awakened American people.
[3:45:28.500 --> 3:45:31.500]  I'm not interrupting because it's like, I think these things driving to work and somehow never saying.
[3:45:31.500 --> 3:45:32.500]  You just said it.
[3:45:32.500 --> 3:45:36.500]  We should put ourselves with Trump literally up on the cross.
[3:45:36.500 --> 3:45:37.500]  Because that's what this is.
[3:45:37.500 --> 3:45:38.500]  And I'm not being blasphemous.
[3:45:38.500 --> 3:45:40.500]  We're all supposed to be Christ-like.
[3:45:40.500 --> 3:45:45.500]  I mean, literally they are destroying, attacking, killing his companies, trying to kill him and his family.
[3:45:45.500 --> 3:45:47.500]  Because that's honorable.
[3:45:47.500 --> 3:45:53.500]  We're winning through that. We should all be literally ready to be attacked by the bots and all of it.
[3:45:53.500 --> 3:45:55.500]  Because we know we're right and you're right.
[3:45:55.500 --> 3:45:57.500]  That's what true empowerment is.
[3:45:57.500 --> 3:45:59.500]  It's not going with the flow.
[3:45:59.500 --> 3:46:03.500]  When the flow is a lie, it's changing things when that's what is needed.
[3:46:03.500 --> 3:46:04.500]  Anthony.
[3:46:04.500 --> 3:46:09.500]  Alex, people might say, wow, that sounds overdramatic on the cross.
[3:46:09.500 --> 3:46:11.500]  Well, people have to be martyred.
[3:46:11.500 --> 3:46:12.500]  It's amazing.
[3:46:12.500 --> 3:46:14.500]  And I don't mean literally killed.
[3:46:14.500 --> 3:46:17.500]  Your reputation, your job.
[3:46:17.500 --> 3:46:25.500]  Things like this will be put in jeopardy when you come forward and try to support what is great and what is good for this country.
[3:46:25.500 --> 3:46:28.500]  That is the tactic they're using to keep people quiet.
[3:46:28.500 --> 3:46:33.500]  The fear factor of losing everything you've worked your life for because you're being called a name.
[3:46:33.500 --> 3:46:37.500]  Just because you're disagreeing with the policies of this machine.
[3:46:37.500 --> 3:46:38.500]  That's right.
[3:46:38.500 --> 3:46:41.500]  We've got to call the bluff on the bullies.
[3:46:41.500 --> 3:46:44.500]  I'm going to let you take over.
[3:46:44.500 --> 3:46:46.500]  Skip on this break to get some more time.
[3:46:46.500 --> 3:46:47.500]  Anthony Coombs on media.com.
[3:46:47.500 --> 3:46:48.500]  Roger Stone, Roger Stone.
[3:46:48.500 --> 3:46:49.500] com.
[3:46:49.500 --> 3:46:50.500]  Stone cold truth.com.
[3:46:50.500 --> 3:46:54.500]  Roger, two minute closing comment here on this huge epic battle in the middle of it.
[3:46:54.500 --> 3:46:56.500]  Who could be bored right now?
[3:46:56.500 --> 3:46:57.500]  I mean, I could hardly sleep.
[3:46:57.500 --> 3:46:59.500]  Like you said, you couldn't sleep.
[3:46:59.500 --> 3:47:02.500]  Regardless, this is not a boring time.
[3:47:02.500 --> 3:47:08.500]  I think that the generals do not want the president to realize the weapons at his disposal.
[3:47:08.500 --> 3:47:10.500]  He needs to do two things.
[3:47:10.500 --> 3:47:13.500]  Nobody in the Washington is afraid of Donald Trump.
[3:47:13.500 --> 3:47:15.500]  They've forgotten his potency in the election.
[3:47:15.500 --> 3:47:18.500]  And it's been a long time since he punished anybody.
[3:47:18.500 --> 3:47:24.500]  He has in the FISA court decision everything he needs to cause the arrest and prosecution
[3:47:24.500 --> 3:47:30.500]  of Mr. Rhodes, Admiral Rogers, Mr. Brennan, Mr. Clapper, Valerie Jarrett.
[3:47:30.500 --> 3:47:34.500]  And yes, what did the president know and when did he know it?
[3:47:34.500 --> 3:47:41.500]  Additionally, Alex, his popularity among the people is at a long time high.
[3:47:41.500 --> 3:47:47.500]  30,000 people in Ohio, which he's very proud of, 27,000 in Pennsylvania.
[3:47:47.500 --> 3:47:51.500]  The poll show that he has gained rather than lost.
[3:47:51.500 --> 3:47:59.500]  If he were to intervene in a bunch of primaries across the country taking on some of his establishment
[3:47:59.500 --> 3:48:05.500]  Republican recalcitrant blockers, Mitch McConnell will do underwear.
[3:48:05.500 --> 3:48:09.500]  I've got, I'm glad we're skipping this break coming up because we knew it was coming.
[3:48:09.500 --> 3:48:12.500]  We knew they said in the next month they're going to move against Trump.
[3:48:12.500 --> 3:48:16.500]  With the separation of powers, a grand jury cannot go after the president.
[3:48:16.500 --> 3:48:18.500]  It's only Congress that can do it.
[3:48:18.500 --> 3:48:22.500]  But they don't want to wait because Trump is dismantling their globalist crime syndicate.
[3:48:22.500 --> 3:48:27.500]  Robert Mueller, the Clinton puppet Wall Street Journal is now reporting this just broke minutes ago.
[3:48:27.500 --> 3:48:29.500]  It's on infowars.com.
[3:48:29.500 --> 3:48:36.500]  Special Counsel Mueller in Panels, Washington, that's a picked DC jury, grand jury.
[3:48:36.500 --> 3:48:41.500]  Special Counsel Mueller in Panels, Washington, grand jury in Russia probe.
[3:48:41.500 --> 3:48:47.500]  And so it begins, ladies and gentlemen, so that Trump can't even take out this guy they slipped in.
[3:48:47.500 --> 3:48:55.500]  They're in paneling a grand jury in controlled in DC by Debbie Wasserman Schultz.
[3:48:55.500 --> 3:49:00.500]  Oh my God, they're accelerating the time table because they know there's criminal investigations of the of the Seth Rich thing.
[3:49:00.500 --> 3:49:05.500]  Special Counsel Robert Mueller has in panel the grand jury in Washington and investigate Russia's interference.
[3:49:05.500 --> 3:49:11.500]  2016 elections, a sign that his inquiry is growing in intensity and entered a new phase according to people familiar.
[3:49:11.500 --> 3:49:14.500]  So they said, oh, it'll take years. That was to make Trump think he had that.
[3:49:14.500 --> 3:49:20.500]  The grand jury, which began its work in recent weeks, is a sign that Mr. Mueller's inquiry is ramping up and it will likely continue for months.
[3:49:20.500 --> 3:49:23.500]  They've got a picked grand jury in the District of Criminals.
[3:49:23.500 --> 3:49:26.500]  Under Debbie Wasserman Schultz control.
[3:49:26.500 --> 3:49:34.500]  Mr. Mueller is investigating Russia's efforts to influence the 2016 election and whether President Donald Trump campaign associates collided with Kremlin as part of it.
[3:49:34.500 --> 3:49:39.500]  A spokesman from Mueller declined to comment. Moscow has declined seeking to influence the election.
[3:49:39.500 --> 3:49:41.500]  Mr. Trump has vigorously disputed it.
[3:49:41.500 --> 3:49:47.500]  Ty Cobbs, Special Counsel, the president said that wasn't aware of Mr. Mueller has started using a new grand jury.
[3:49:47.500 --> 3:49:50.500]  Grand jury matters are typically secret, of course they're not now.
[3:49:50.500 --> 3:49:56.500]  Mr. Cobbs said the White House favors anything that accelerates the conclusion of this work fairly.
[3:49:56.500 --> 3:49:59.500]  The White House has committed to fully cooperating with Mr. Mueller.
[3:49:59.500 --> 3:50:02.500]  Wow, this is next level stuff.
[3:50:02.500 --> 3:50:07.500]  So they are getting ready right now, these traders, these scumbags.
[3:50:07.500 --> 3:50:11.500]  The Mueller secretly and tarmac meetings with the Russians with uranium transfers.
[3:50:11.500 --> 3:50:13.500]  Roger Stone.
[3:50:13.500 --> 3:50:16.500]  Alex, you're absolutely right.
[3:50:16.500 --> 3:50:21.500]  Mr. Mueller is the executioner, the intended executioner.
[3:50:21.500 --> 3:50:30.500]  Congressman Greg Jarrett pointed out this morning that because of his relationship with Comey, because he actually coached Comey.
[3:50:30.500 --> 3:50:42.500]  And more importantly, because Mueller himself auditioned with the president immediately after Comey's firing for Comey's job, but was passed over.
[3:50:42.500 --> 3:50:45.500]  He has obvious conflicts of interest.
[3:50:45.500 --> 3:50:47.500]  He's a butthurt quisling.
[3:50:47.500 --> 3:50:50.500]  What does Trump do to flush this guy out of the toilet?
[3:50:50.500 --> 3:50:58.500]  Well, here's the other stunning thing I learned last night, and that is perhaps I've been too harsh on Jeff Sessions.
[3:50:58.500 --> 3:51:01.500]  He is evidently captive in his own department.
[3:51:01.500 --> 3:51:10.500]  I am told that the first ring of assistance there had been told not to carry out his orders and that he's been unable to get a phone call through to the president.
[3:51:10.500 --> 3:51:18.500]  So what they do is they talk crap about Sessions, Trump stops talking to him, then Sessions is locked up, total intelligence soft.
[3:51:18.500 --> 3:51:23.500]  He's got to get a council together, everybody to suss it out and move against the enemy.
[3:51:23.500 --> 3:51:25.500]  Well, exactly.
[3:51:25.500 --> 3:51:31.500]  And if Mr. Mueller has a grand jury, it's time for Mr. Sessions to have a grand jury.
[3:51:31.500 --> 3:51:33.500]  They want to remove our president.
[3:51:33.500 --> 3:51:35.500]  Let's put their president in jail.
[3:51:35.500 --> 3:51:36.500]  Here's the thing.
[3:51:36.500 --> 3:51:39.500]  Why don't people have political, geopolitical, military understanding?
[3:51:39.500 --> 3:51:40.500]  You and I have it.
[3:51:40.500 --> 3:51:42.500]  I always thought I was average.
[3:51:42.500 --> 3:51:43.500]  I get around.
[3:51:43.500 --> 3:51:45.500]  Generals, CIA people, they don't know.
[3:51:45.500 --> 3:51:47.500]  They're like children.
[3:51:47.500 --> 3:51:50.500]  Don't they understand what's going on here?
[3:51:50.500 --> 3:51:52.500]  Even the enemy is so idle.
[3:51:52.500 --> 3:51:56.500]  They're easily defeated if the president is conscious of this operation.
[3:51:56.500 --> 3:52:02.500]  There's two more words that I think the president would find very, very useful at this juncture.
[3:52:02.500 --> 3:52:04.500]  Term, limits.
[3:52:04.500 --> 3:52:07.500]  He wrote about them as early as 2000.
[3:52:07.500 --> 3:52:08.500]  He has always supported them.
[3:52:08.500 --> 3:52:13.500]  They strike fear in the heart of the Washington power brokers and their Republican establishment.
[3:52:13.500 --> 3:52:19.500]  And if he begins to beat the drum, he will get enormous political leverage from the American people.
[3:52:19.500 --> 3:52:20.500]  All right.
[3:52:20.500 --> 3:52:21.500]  I'm going to let Anthony have the final comment here.
[3:52:21.500 --> 3:52:23.500]  I want to tell listeners.
[3:52:23.500 --> 3:52:27.500]  Never before has the world, not just America, been in such a crosshair.
[3:52:27.500 --> 3:52:32.500]  But it's the Chinese character for opportunity is also crisis.
[3:52:32.500 --> 3:52:34.500]  We are in the crucible right now.

[3:52:38.500 --> 3:52:41.500]  Please spread the articles, the videos, our analysis.
[3:52:41.500 --> 3:52:42.500]  The world's ready for it.
[3:52:42.500 --> 3:52:46.500]  The enemy recognizes us as dangerous because we know the truth.
[3:52:46.500 --> 3:52:48.500]  We have free shipping that ends today.
[3:52:48.500 --> 3:52:50.500]  It was extended one day because they didn't take it down.
[3:52:50.500 --> 3:52:58.500]  We have the new 1776 special, 55% off on brain force, survival shields, secret 12, oil oregano, bio selenium.
[3:52:58.500 --> 3:53:05.500]  The new super blue mouthwash with colloidal silver, the John Oliver challenge, 30% off on the chocolate or strawberry flavored bone broth.

[3:53:10.500 --> 3:53:14.500]  But whatever you do, stand up to these bullies, speak out, take action.
[3:53:14.500 --> 3:53:16.500]  Roger Stone, amazing job, Anthony Cummings.
[3:53:16.500 --> 3:53:19.500]  Thank you so much for your great work and your great comments.
[3:53:19.500 --> 3:53:23.500]  I'm going to hand this over to you in the last six, seven minutes to have final comments.
[3:53:23.500 --> 3:53:26.500]  Again, Anthony, thank you so much and thank you, Roger Stone.
[3:53:26.500 --> 3:53:28.500]  Bottom line, history is happening.
[3:53:28.500 --> 3:53:30.500]  Everybody needs to be focused in a way.
[3:53:30.500 --> 3:53:35.500]  Back to Anthony Cummings from Compound Media.
[3:53:35.500 --> 3:53:36.500]  Thanks, Alex.
[3:53:36.500 --> 3:53:40.500]  Man, yeah, we are in a hell of a time.
[3:53:40.500 --> 3:53:50.500]  It's like I said, I never dreamt I would be around when we see people moving against the president.
[3:53:50.500 --> 3:53:55.500]  And so obviously, Alex was just saying it before, how do we see this?
[3:53:55.500 --> 3:53:58.500]  And how do so many other Americans actually see this?
[3:53:58.500 --> 3:54:01.500]  And then others are blinded to it.
[3:54:01.500 --> 3:54:09.500]  I sometimes think they're not as naive or just plain stupid as I would be led to believe,
[3:54:09.500 --> 3:54:14.500]  but that they actually don't care that this is happening.
[3:54:14.500 --> 3:54:21.500]  Getting rid of Donald Trump, every look, everyone can't be involved in what's going on.
[3:54:21.500 --> 3:54:26.500]  There is absolutely a coup in the midst of taking place right now.
[3:54:26.500 --> 3:54:33.500]  Not everyone's involved that considers themselves liberal, Democrat, the left, progressive, whatever you want to call it.
[3:54:33.500 --> 3:54:41.500]  But they actually believe that regardless of what it takes to remove Donald Trump,
[3:54:41.500 --> 3:54:49.500]  that he's so evil and so detrimental to this country that it would still be a good thing, regardless of how he's removed.
[3:54:49.500 --> 3:54:55.500]  Not realizing it spells the absolute end of America as we know it.
[3:54:55.500 --> 3:55:06.500]  They would rather live in a country where a power base is so strong that they could remove an elected president of these United States,
[3:55:06.500 --> 3:55:10.500]  and it would just still be a grand, great place to live.
[3:55:10.500 --> 3:55:20.500]  You just go to sleep in the Matrix, in the little pod, and have your steak, and it's juicy, and the glass of wine,
[3:55:20.500 --> 3:55:22.500]  and you don't have to worry about a thing.
[3:55:22.500 --> 3:55:31.500]  Well, the truth of the matter is, if they're able to get away with that, what the hell type of freedoms do you think you have?
[3:55:31.500 --> 3:55:33.500]  The American people.
[3:55:33.500 --> 3:55:34.500]  What's next?
[3:55:34.500 --> 3:55:35.500]  Exactly.
[3:55:35.500 --> 3:55:36.500]  The sky's the limit.
[3:55:36.500 --> 3:55:37.500]  What's next?
[3:55:37.500 --> 3:55:38.500]  Sorry.
[3:55:38.500 --> 3:55:40.500]  Yeah, well, how are they fina-
[3:55:40.500 --> 3:55:42.500]  We are financing them.
[3:55:42.500 --> 3:55:49.500]  We have to pump our hard-earned money and actually pay people to abuse us.
[3:55:49.500 --> 3:55:55.500]  What kind of a sick cuckolding is it that you don't get angry at that?
[3:55:55.500 --> 3:56:01.500]  That we shovel boatloads of cash into this system that does nothing but screw us?
[3:56:01.500 --> 3:56:06.500]  And finally, a guy shows up that wants to bet on humanity and ride that wave.
[3:56:06.500 --> 3:56:08.500]  He'll be on top of that wave. That's a leader.
[3:56:08.500 --> 3:56:15.500]  And they're trying to stop him, but just the idea of it puts $4 trillion in the stock market, $400 billion in new jobs,
[3:56:15.500 --> 3:56:20.500]  and the economy rushes back for a minute, like gasping for air, and they're all pissed and howling,
[3:56:20.500 --> 3:56:22.500]  because they don't like us being successful.
[3:56:22.500 --> 3:56:27.500]  They want to be the little grimy worms that look at us all poor down below them.
[3:56:27.500 --> 3:56:28.500]  They want to bring feudalism back.
[3:56:28.500 --> 3:56:29.500]  Well, I tell them this.
[3:56:29.500 --> 3:56:31.500]  They get the delay ready.
[3:56:31.500 --> 3:56:32.500]  Fuck you.
[3:56:32.500 --> 3:56:35.500]  I'm sick of your fucking bullshit.
[3:56:35.500 --> 3:56:39.500]  I am. Get out of my way. Get out of the way.
[3:56:39.500 --> 3:56:44.500]  Bravo, Alex. Man, that really does say it all.
[3:56:44.500 --> 3:56:50.500]  We all have to get to that point where we say that they don't want us to be successful,
[3:56:50.500 --> 3:56:58.500]  because if we don't need them, if we don't need the government to help us constantly with our lives,
[3:56:58.500 --> 3:57:00.500]  what could they possibly hold over our heads?
[3:57:00.500 --> 3:57:06.500]  They want us to be cattle and sheep, and they want the economy to be lousy,
[3:57:06.500 --> 3:57:11.500]  so they could tell you that we'll help you, we'll make it better, and they never make it better,
[3:57:11.500 --> 3:57:15.500]  because they want to keep us down like this.
[3:57:15.500 --> 3:57:20.500]  So when Trump comes in, a businessman, and we're looking at record levels in the stock market,
[3:57:20.500 --> 3:57:24.500]  the consumer confidence is way up, jobs, small businesses,
[3:57:24.500 --> 3:57:30.500]  these are things that petrify the government leaders in this country,
[3:57:30.500 --> 3:57:35.500]  because, again, it's like a parent when the child goes off to college.
[3:57:35.500 --> 3:57:41.500]  They sit there and cry because they know, oh, they really don't need us anymore.
[3:57:41.500 --> 3:57:44.500]  They're out on their own. They're living their life.
[3:57:44.500 --> 3:57:47.500]  The globalists have emptiness syndrome.
[3:57:47.500 --> 3:57:51.500]  Yeah, so when the government sees that happen, they blatantly,
[3:57:51.500 --> 3:57:54.500]  and they don't even, you know what it is? They don't have the time.
[3:57:54.500 --> 3:57:59.500]  Trump works so quickly that they don't have the time to do this covertly,
[3:57:59.500 --> 3:58:03.500]  so they've thrown the curtains open, and they're telling us,
[3:58:03.500 --> 3:58:08.500]  yeah, we're going to remove the guy that you elected that is making America great,
[3:58:08.500 --> 3:58:11.500]  and there's literally nothing you can do about it.
[3:58:11.500 --> 3:58:17.500]  I am stunned at the turn of events that I've seen transpire over the past year.
[3:58:17.500 --> 3:58:22.500]  Never mind even before that. But you can't turn away. I mean, you can't turn away, though.
[3:58:22.500 --> 3:58:25.500]  I mean, let's face it. Is this not edge of your seat stuff, Anthony?
[3:58:25.500 --> 3:58:31.500]  It's the most edge of your seat historic stuff I've ever seen in my lifetime, Alex.
[3:58:31.500 --> 3:58:34.500]  What a great guy. Compoundmedia.com, folks. Go check it out today.
[3:58:34.500 --> 3:58:37.500]  Thank you so much, my friend. Thanks, Alex.
[3:58:37.500 --> 3:58:48.500]  All right. Nightly news tonight. We got big break of stuff then, too.
