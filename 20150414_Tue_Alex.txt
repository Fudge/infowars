[00:00.000 --> 00:08.980]  the news is over the top big brother mainstream media some believe government
[00:08.980 --> 00:16.100]  cover-ups you want answers so do we so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN
[00:16.100 --> 00:24.540]  radio and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones well this is one of those
[00:24.540 --> 00:28.420]  days where my head is spinning we don't have a guest until the third hour and
[00:28.420 --> 00:31.640]  that's kind of a good thing because it's gonna take some time to cover all
[00:31.640 --> 00:37.720]  this and I've got to get to it in fact I'm gonna go back into some of the
[00:37.720 --> 00:44.280]  earlier articles that I didn't even cover yesterday properly as well like
[00:44.280 --> 00:49.420]  kids being taken from their parents all over the country for playing you know in
[00:49.420 --> 00:53.720]  their backyard or walking to the park a half mile away come at ten year olds and
[00:53.720 --> 01:00.480]  stuff 11 year olds calling it neglect we've got forced inoculation we've
[01:00.480 --> 01:06.200]  got just this entire push going on that really shows us the totalitarian world
[01:06.200 --> 01:12.920]  we're going into and then stacks of news like this CBS investigation TSA
[01:12.920 --> 01:20.040]  screeners at DIA manipulated system to grope men's genitals homosexual TSA
[01:20.040 --> 01:25.480]  workers would sit there picking out good-looking men that struck their fancy
[01:25.480 --> 01:32.080]  and then they would grope them now we've known this is going on we've written
[01:32.080 --> 01:36.480]  countless articles about it happening to good-looking women and them settling
[01:36.480 --> 01:42.200]  lawsuits where they go so far as this go my god you're so beautiful will you
[01:42.200 --> 01:48.240]  date me and they've done this what was to miss USA and in Dallas and they
[01:48.240 --> 01:56.000]  settled another suit was it an Amarillo where the multiple TSA guys came in like
[01:56.000 --> 01:59.880]  it was Central Park you know where they gang raped women and we just like baby
[01:59.880 --> 02:04.480]  I got to have your number they just are so disconnected from reality that this
[02:04.480 --> 02:14.300]  is what they're doing I've had TSA at LAX call me mr. stinky feet when I was
[02:14.300 --> 02:19.080]  wearing brand new shoes that only worn a few times I was out there on a TV show
[02:19.080 --> 02:24.000]  and had and a neurotic about taking two or three showers or baths a day and
[02:24.000 --> 02:29.120]  had put fresh socks on at my hotel got in the taxi driven to the thing I had
[02:29.120 --> 02:32.920]  totally clean feet want to say you could have eaten off of them but I mean it was
[02:32.920 --> 02:38.400]  close to that so it wasn't I even had stinky feet nobody they were just two
[02:38.400 --> 02:42.720]  black guys being racial saying mr. stinky feet and it's just all about
[02:42.720 --> 02:48.600]  petty people some of them are white races want to mess with minorities some
[02:48.600 --> 02:50.920]  of them are black races want to mess with white people some of them are
[02:50.920 --> 02:54.360]  pedophiles want to grow up little kids some of them want to grow up women some
[02:54.360 --> 02:58.440]  want to grow up men I told the story of Vegas and I'm not climbing on the best
[02:58.440 --> 03:03.880]  looking guy around but I didn't want to do the naked body scanner so you know
[03:03.880 --> 03:07.600]  opted to be searched you can tell when they're just doing a real search versus
[03:07.600 --> 03:12.560]  the groping and I mean this guy took four minutes it seemed like it took an
[03:12.560 --> 03:16.720]  hour and he got down on his knees in front of me and was just smacking his
[03:16.720 --> 03:23.240]  lips and it was it was totally homoerotic I mean he was just really
[03:23.240 --> 03:26.560]  telling me he was a listener just listen to the show told me what was on the show
[03:26.560 --> 03:30.520]  the day before her we do the show from my Las Vegas hotel room in between
[03:30.520 --> 03:36.880]  shooting Jesse Ventura's TV show and he was just overcome with with lust I
[03:36.880 --> 03:41.200]  mean it was like when I had women look you know getting excited before I was
[03:41.200 --> 03:45.480]  married or whatever and you're about to not to get graphic but jumping the sack
[03:45.480 --> 03:49.240]  you know that passionate look I mean it was like down his knees looking at me

[03:55.760 --> 04:02.040]  this is unbelievable and I look down he was smacking his lips I mean I have
[04:02.040 --> 04:07.160]  experienced this told you the story many times here it is confirmed and if it

[04:18.960 --> 04:24.120]  oh but it's okay because they're gay
[04:26.240 --> 04:30.960]  woman claims US Airport security staff singled her out for her breasts of course
[04:30.960 --> 04:35.000]  I've been there before when TSA was really out of control I gotta say they're
[04:35.000 --> 04:38.240]  not as bad as they used to be I'm just gonna be honest they were really arrogant
[04:38.240 --> 04:41.840]  a few years ago and I've seen them go and they'll point at some super hot woman

[08:30.800 --> 08:36.320]  infernal leavening service shut up in 1913 we have a quote on the front page
[08:36.320 --> 08:49.200]  of info wars dot com by Ron Paul where he said that 2015 is basically a lot like
[08:49.200 --> 08:56.840]  2014 the year before that just more tyranny and yet another Ron Paul quote
[08:56.840 --> 09:08.120]  2013 the hundred year anniversary marks 1913 and his quote was 1913 wasn't a
[09:08.120 --> 09:16.680]  very good year 1913 gave us the income tax the 16th amendment and the IRS
[09:16.680 --> 09:23.520]  Ron Paul one of our daily infographic quotes I tell you I want to get some
[09:23.520 --> 09:31.560]  infographic images memes going of and that's William Blake I spent about an
[09:31.560 --> 09:34.800]  hour this morning when I should have been researching news and information
[09:34.800 --> 09:46.120]  reading William Blake quotes a listener posted a William Blake page of poetry in
[09:46.120 --> 09:50.800]  the comments of info wars dot com yesterday and it was very thought
[09:50.800 --> 09:55.120]  provoking extremely powerful and so I stayed up pretty late last night reading
[09:55.120 --> 09:59.360]  William Blake poetry and then I thought why not read some of his quotes so I
[09:59.360 --> 10:05.800]  got into those and it was just pure veritas I just resonated with every
[10:05.800 --> 10:10.280]  single line of it and have experienced those exact same thoughts organically and
[10:10.280 --> 10:18.200]  independently that's when you know you're dealing with real truth veritas
[10:18.200 --> 10:27.080]  intense riveting beautiful more valuable than all the gems and jewels and
[10:27.080 --> 10:35.520]  metals and possessions of this world or this dimension really help crystallize
[10:35.520 --> 10:41.360]  things for me and if I have time I meant to come into the office and actually get
[10:41.360 --> 10:47.200]  the guys to go to some of the quote sites and print me voluminous pages of
[10:47.200 --> 10:59.880]  William Blake truth so that I could go over those on air and read some of those
[10:59.880 --> 11:08.240]  but alas never got around to it I love this William Blake quote I took some
[11:08.240 --> 11:11.720]  screenshots of some of these when I tell the truth it's not for the sake of
[11:11.720 --> 11:17.640]  convincing those who don't know it but for the sake of defending those that do
[11:17.640 --> 11:22.760]  all of this just common sense where mercy love and pity dwell their God is
[11:22.760 --> 11:28.840]  dwelling to just quotes like that imagination is the real eternal world
[11:28.840 --> 11:35.560]  of which this vegetable universe is but a faint shadow the tigers of wrath are
[11:35.560 --> 11:42.240]  wiser than the horses of instruction or mercy love and pity dwell their God is
[11:42.240 --> 11:49.240]  dwelling when the greenwoods laugh with the joy with the voice of joy and the
[11:49.240 --> 11:55.200]  dimpling stream runs laughing by when the air does laugh with our merry wit and
[11:55.200 --> 12:00.800]  the green hills laugh with the noise of it these aren't even the best I took
[12:00.800 --> 12:06.120]  hundreds of these screenshots love seeketh not itself to please nor for
[12:06.120 --> 12:10.520]  itself have any care but for another gives its ease and builds a heaven and
[12:10.520 --> 12:20.320]  hell's despair if the doors of perception were cleansed everything would
[12:20.320 --> 12:27.440]  appear to man as it is infinite the fool sees not the same tree that a wise man
[12:27.440 --> 12:39.760]  sees I love this quote this is real simple stuff compared to his poetry it
[12:39.760 --> 12:48.040]  is easier to forgive an enemy than to forgive a friend boy in that trip the
[12:48.040 --> 12:52.680]  burden asked to spider a web man friendship
[12:54.000 --> 12:58.480]  oh this is my favorite quote of the hundreds I read this morning I must
[12:58.480 --> 13:04.600]  create a system or be enslaved by another man's I will not reason and
[13:04.600 --> 13:08.760]  compare my businesses to create
[13:11.840 --> 13:16.760]  great things are done when men in mountains meet great challenge is what
[13:16.760 --> 13:25.120]  makes us great that's all the theory of great men and great women the tree which
[13:25.120 --> 13:30.520]  moves some to tears of joy is in the eyes of others only a green thing that
[13:30.520 --> 13:36.920]  stands in its way some see nature all ridicule and deformity and some scare
[13:36.920 --> 13:42.080]  see nature at all but to the eyes of the man of imagination nature is
[13:42.080 --> 13:52.640]  imagination itself the thankful receiver bears a plentiful harvest and
[13:52.640 --> 14:00.320]  that's just a few quotes of hundreds and hundreds you know it's funny I was
[14:00.320 --> 14:07.440]  reading what they even give the enlisted soldiers now in the US Army you've all
[14:07.440 --> 14:10.640]  seen it in the news the founding fathers are bad they wouldn't be welcome in the
[14:10.640 --> 14:16.080]  military don't be part of the tea party or you'll be court-martialed just
[14:16.080 --> 14:20.800]  outrageous totalitarian stuff that just shows us where the controllers want to
[14:20.800 --> 14:25.280]  take us and they have to say outrageous stuff to get us there to prepare us to
[14:25.280 --> 14:29.440]  accept it they're conditioning us because it's not as outrageous two years ago I
[14:29.440 --> 14:34.600]  came out sent to us from folks at Fort Hood the commanding general saying if
[14:34.600 --> 14:37.840]  you go to a tea party meeting or you're an evangelical Christian and if you give
[14:37.840 --> 14:43.160]  them money see the globalists don't want us forming an Americana political
[14:43.160 --> 14:48.680]  movement that's what the IRS persecutions all of it is about if you're part of
[14:48.680 --> 14:53.120]  that legal lawful stuff you can do in your own time we will arrest you we will
[14:53.120 --> 14:57.200]  indict you we will put you in the brig we will imprison you and no one believed
[14:57.200 --> 15:00.800]  me for about a week till Fox News checked into it called the base and the
[15:00.800 --> 15:06.480]  base admitted largest military base in the world admitted yes indeed we did
[15:06.480 --> 15:18.520]  say that people couldn't believe that two years ago now today on a daily basis
[15:18.520 --> 15:23.280]  there's new memos new sensitivity training and I have the new one today
[15:23.280 --> 15:31.560]  from the daily caller historical influences equal opportunity management
[15:31.560 --> 15:41.400]  institute and this is what's taught in the sexism courses in the military and
[15:41.400 --> 15:46.320]  it goes on to say the term we the people is racist that the great man theory that
[15:46.320 --> 15:50.360]  is held that by some to explain history by the impact of great men well that's
[15:50.360 --> 15:54.880]  what happens great men great women who shift things and who aren't there to be
[15:54.880 --> 15:58.480]  sold out or bought off to believe in the great ideals of humanity that's called
[15:58.480 --> 16:03.520]  leadership but oh they're saying imagine teaching the military we're not about
[16:03.520 --> 16:10.400]  great men we're not about daring greatly I mean if I wanted to sabotage the US
[16:10.400 --> 16:16.080]  military this is what I would teach I mean this is outrageous crap this is
[16:16.080 --> 16:24.360]  soul-killing poison but here's William Blake about the great men seen as the
[16:24.360 --> 16:31.160]  great liberal poet of all time the liberals now worship him they don't
[16:31.160 --> 16:35.560]  even read what he wrote because they say the opposite they say the opposite of
[16:35.560 --> 16:40.080]  what Martin Luther King said or Gandhi said but yet they claim all these people
[16:40.080 --> 16:46.080]  these are mafia thugs with the idiot camp followers that wrap themselves in
[16:46.080 --> 16:53.760]  all the laurels that are not theirs they are imposters they are pretenders they
[16:53.760 --> 16:59.120]  are frauds let me just read you the headlines because this is why I get so
[16:59.120 --> 17:02.680]  upset before I go on air and then can't even get to it because I'm so shaken by
[17:02.680 --> 17:06.560]  all the news I've read that then I just I almost like don't want to give you the
[17:06.560 --> 17:11.000]  bad news like your grandma died but we need to know the truth and the whole of
[17:11.000 --> 17:15.960]  it make preparation for it to quote Patrick Henry and his famous speech
[17:15.960 --> 17:20.720]  give me liberty or give me death so let me just do it defense department the
[17:20.720 --> 17:26.360]  Bible Constitution and Declaration of Independence are all sexist and it goes
[17:26.360 --> 17:30.520]  on to say racist I mean you cannot make this up you just cannot make this up
[17:30.520 --> 17:40.600]  that's daily color stop on info wars.com too let's go to the next one we
[17:40.600 --> 17:46.280]  told you that something was suspicious about this dirty bomb drill and I got
[17:46.280 --> 17:50.320]  it wrong I told bigs look I don't care they told you can't go to it because I
[17:50.320 --> 17:52.840]  guarantee of the dirty bomb drill is just legitimized troops on the streets
[17:52.840 --> 17:57.040]  and they'll be doing the real training somewhere else well that's how it usually
[17:57.040 --> 18:01.240]  is now they just lied and said it was dirty bomb training and now we have the
[18:01.240 --> 18:06.600]  role-playing memo from the army and we have from the video another video
[18:06.600 --> 18:11.160]  they're training to take on veterans gun owners patriots and they say that in the
[18:11.160 --> 18:17.480]  memo I mean wow no wonder they said info wars isn't welcome there because the
[18:17.480 --> 18:20.640]  citizen press that got in was like 50 yards away and you have to boost the
[18:20.640 --> 18:27.040]  audio to even hear it but man I'm gonna be getting to that I mean you have the
[18:27.040 --> 18:31.680]  government that's illegitimate preparing for total war against us because we hold

[33:21.480 --> 33:26.680]  network here's another William Blake quote men are admitted into heaven not
[33:26.680 --> 33:30.400]  because they have curved and govern their passions or have no passions but
[33:30.400 --> 33:34.480]  because they have cultivated their understandings the treasures of heaven
[33:34.480 --> 33:39.880]  are not negations of passion but realities of intellect from which all the
[33:39.880 --> 33:49.120]  passion emanates uncurbed in their eternal glory and that's from a man in
[33:49.120 --> 34:00.000]  the very oppressive times of the 17 and 1800s in Victorian England where they
[34:00.000 --> 34:05.080]  were taking a very aggressive dominant group of people and putting them through
[34:05.080 --> 34:12.920]  imperial training to be submissive and agroble to oppression of course that
[34:12.920 --> 34:16.520]  didn't work out too well at the same time over here in the United States which
[34:16.520 --> 34:21.240]  William Blake was a big supporter of the American Revolution I don't mean to go
[34:21.240 --> 34:30.240]  off into a side area on that we know that the TSA all over the country with
[34:30.240 --> 34:37.040]  people like Miss USA and others go inside the women's bodies in front of
[34:37.040 --> 34:43.480]  people and this is all an act of total domination over the public to see how
[34:43.480 --> 34:47.400]  much we will accept and top psychiatrists and child psychologists have gone
[34:47.400 --> 34:53.680]  public you can just Google it and said over and over again that that's how
[34:53.680 --> 34:57.880]  pedophiles train children is they first touch them and test them and that the
[34:57.880 --> 35:01.680]  groping of children in airports is going to prime children to accept
[35:01.680 --> 35:07.200]  pedophiles attacking them and then how many thousands of articles have you
[35:07.200 --> 35:12.560]  seen with the hundreds of cases of the TSA being caught being pedophiles
[35:12.560 --> 35:17.520]  outside of work and that's because if you were a pedophile what would you
[35:17.520 --> 35:22.680]  crave a badge in a uniform where you can mess with kids I'm not saying even a
[35:22.680 --> 35:28.680]  large part of TSA are pedophiles I'm saying statistically we know that
[35:28.680 --> 35:38.200]  juvenile workers teachers truancy officers CPS workers are the highest
[35:38.200 --> 35:46.240]  level of pedophilia because that's where they go craving the authority and the
[35:46.240 --> 35:51.120]  respect of the office to then carry out their operations it's well known in
[35:51.120 --> 35:56.000]  criminology that psychopaths also seek power sociopaths but pedophiles
[35:56.000 --> 36:00.160]  deviants and others seek power then they recruit more people in under them to
[36:00.160 --> 36:05.960]  protect them and the pyramid of evil grows they can do it in the Vatican they
[36:05.960 --> 36:10.120]  can do it in a Protestant church they can do it in a prison they can do it in a
[36:10.120 --> 36:16.480]  office building in a school it can be any institution can be taken over by
[36:16.480 --> 36:21.280]  cults and the most common throughout history from Rome right through today is
[36:21.280 --> 36:29.040]  the sex cult now if they use moral compass arguments then they will create
[36:29.040 --> 36:34.400]  cults of homosexuality because then if that's suppressed they can use that for
[36:34.400 --> 36:38.840]  blackmail and then you go to the next level and then it becomes underage
[36:38.840 --> 36:48.920]  16 15 then 10 then 5 then newborn babies then snuff films the top of the
[36:48.920 --> 36:53.320]  pyramid to even get into the highest levels of the power structure in the
[36:53.320 --> 36:57.880]  angle American establishment and this is come out many times you have to rape
[36:57.880 --> 37:02.400]  small children and then they like to starve them to death while telling them
[37:02.400 --> 37:06.720]  they'll never see their mommy again in dungeons and Paul Watson's death stories
[37:06.720 --> 37:09.280]  on this I have if you don't live in Europe you don't know about it they've
[37:09.280 --> 37:14.240]  had a bunch of stories in France the Netherlands and other countries Sweden
[37:14.240 --> 37:20.200]  you name it where they find the dungeons protected by the government with the
[37:20.200 --> 37:26.480]  toddlers that are in cages and after they've been raped and used up they then
[37:26.480 --> 37:32.800]  are terrified in the dark by Satanist dressed up in demon outfits and they
[37:32.800 --> 37:36.880]  believe that it's torturing the soul and horrifying them until the child goes
[37:36.880 --> 37:45.480]  into catatonic zombie state is the best way to really hurt a child and that's
[37:45.480 --> 37:48.480]  why it's not enough for them when the baby fights off the scalpel and the
[37:48.480 --> 37:52.160]  knife and the womb I mean that's a pleasure but it's not a hundred percent
[37:52.160 --> 37:55.760]  conscious so it doesn't give them the real satanic energy they need the true
[37:55.760 --> 38:00.800]  sacrament and if you're a new listener don't know about this just type in
[38:00.800 --> 38:05.880]  children found in dungeon in Europe you know millions march against pedophile
[38:05.880 --> 38:09.240]  rings protecting government and I mean there's just hundreds of cases and it
[38:09.240 --> 38:13.920]  turns out the top judges the top prime ministers are involved and then it all
[38:13.920 --> 38:17.240]  stops because the government comes out and says it's national security we
[38:17.240 --> 38:21.080]  can't release it they just said in England last month the prime minister said
[38:21.080 --> 38:24.560]  and the head of MI6 said the MI5 they were they were all quoted saying this is
[38:24.560 --> 38:32.560]  national security we have to shut it down it cannot be public because when
[38:32.560 --> 38:37.720]  you learn the people running things want to put children in cages two-year-olds
[38:37.720 --> 38:41.920]  and have them I mean reportedly the Satanist will sit in there just for
[38:41.920 --> 38:45.840]  hours like it's music the begging sobbing children ten seconds of that
[38:45.840 --> 38:49.960]  would tear my guts out ten seconds of that in their presence would make me so
[38:49.960 --> 38:54.760]  violent I guarantee you I could smash people's brains out with one hand but
[38:54.760 --> 39:00.120]  see we're that's torture for me and hell that's heaven for them
[39:00.960 --> 39:04.440]  yep there's a headline national security could be threatened by the news
[39:04.440 --> 39:12.080]  story and what headline is that that's out of the what the Daily Mail go to the
[39:12.080 --> 39:17.880]  top I'm gonna give them the source that that's the Daily Beast yeah I want to
[39:17.880 --> 39:23.680]  show them it was actually in the BBC headline petafile scandal national
[39:23.680 --> 39:27.520]  security threat and then they say in the article could bring down the entire
[39:27.520 --> 39:32.440]  government so they're gonna cover it up see you commit a crime so big that it
[39:32.440 --> 39:36.600]  would bring the whole system down if it came out and then you're protected that's
[39:36.600 --> 39:43.400]  what too big to fail is where they sign you on to 2.2 global quadrillion and fake
[39:43.400 --> 39:49.280]  made-up money many many many many many times bigger than all the real assets in
[39:49.280 --> 40:01.400]  the world and then nothing can be done because it's so attached to everything
[40:01.400 --> 40:10.000]  else there it is Daily Mail Royal was part of suspected
[40:10.000 --> 40:13.440]  petafile ring me investigated by Scotland Yard but the anger was shut down for
[40:13.440 --> 40:18.760]  national security reasons that's pretty close the actual headline is petafile
[40:18.760 --> 40:22.560]  scandal national security threat is the actual headline now maybe click web
[40:22.560 --> 40:26.320]  because it's a couple months old maybe you're searching news that's getting
[40:26.320 --> 40:29.840]  drowned out all the new stuff there's hundreds of news articles a day about it
[40:29.840 --> 40:35.640]  and again the police go in low level I want to do something about it when they
[40:35.640 --> 40:39.720]  dig into a dungeon that's got you know 30 40 skeletons in it five six little
[40:39.720 --> 40:44.120]  kids who are just gone you know they weigh half of what they should their
[40:44.120 --> 40:49.680]  eyes just stare out they've been savagely raped and then they try to do
[40:49.680 --> 40:52.960]  something and they find out the police chiefs involved and they find out the
[40:52.960 --> 40:58.160]  governor's involved and it just goes up the chain CBS for investigation TSA
[40:58.160 --> 41:06.200]  screeners at DIA manipulated system to grope man's genitals a CBS for
[41:06.200 --> 41:09.000]  investigation has learned that to transportation security administration
[41:09.000 --> 41:12.280]  screeners at Denver International Airport have been fired after they were
[41:12.280 --> 41:15.840]  discovered manipulating passenger screening systems to allow a male TSA
[41:15.840 --> 41:20.280]  employee to fondle the genital areas of attractive male passengers it happened
[41:20.280 --> 41:24.240]  roughly a dozen times according to information gathered by CBS news that
[41:24.240 --> 41:27.800]  probably means it's about a thousand times worse according to law enforcement
[41:27.800 --> 41:32.240]  reports obtained by CBS for investigation a male TSA screener told a female
[41:32.240 --> 41:36.920]  colleague in 2014 that he grew up smell passengers who come through the screening
[41:36.920 --> 41:44.840]  area at DIA he related that when a male he finds attractive comes to be screened
[41:44.840 --> 41:48.520]  of a screening machine he will alert another TSA screener yeah they hit the
[41:48.520 --> 41:53.400]  button on you to indicate to the screening computer that the party being
[41:53.400 --> 41:57.640]  searched is a female when the screener does this the scanning machine will
[41:57.640 --> 42:03.240]  indicate an anomaly in the genital area that allows the TSA screener to
[42:03.240 --> 42:06.760]  conduct a pat down search of the area so see the scanner hones in on your
[42:06.760 --> 42:11.560]  genitals already they pass those around that's come out but then it knows it
[42:11.560 --> 42:17.560]  was women this isn't a female this is a male so now we we're gonna have to
[42:17.560 --> 42:23.000]  grope you although the TSA learned of the accusation in 2014 the anonymous tip
[42:23.000 --> 42:25.840]  for one of the agency's own employees report show that it would be nearly
[42:25.840 --> 42:30.160]  three months before anything was done folks this is nothing notice they'll
[42:30.160 --> 42:35.320]  tell you about this though but not about the Dinecore Halliburton sex slave
[42:35.320 --> 42:38.680]  rings which are in the Chicago Tribune I mean it comes out it's not a big story
[42:38.680 --> 42:43.320]  hidden cameras reveal airport workers stealing from luggage seeing in and it
[42:43.320 --> 42:47.680]  just goes over Miami and how they rob people and they'll rob you right there
[42:47.680 --> 42:52.640]  while they're checking your bags yeah I told the story many times is about two
[42:52.640 --> 42:57.760]  years after 9-11 I was a 9-11 truth event flew back I went to Tiffany's and
[42:57.760 --> 43:01.040]  bought like a hundred dollar rattle and a hundred dollar teeth and thing for my
[43:01.040 --> 43:10.160]  newborn daughter she was three months old and they opened the little Tiffany
[43:10.160 --> 43:19.800]  blue present boxes and just stole only one of them rattles just stole it just
[43:19.800 --> 43:24.080]  you know it's all part of freedom I'm just saying this is all happened to me so
[43:24.080 --> 43:27.640]  imagine how widespread it is I don't even fly that much probably more than
[43:27.640 --> 43:33.760]  most people but not like a business traveler something I haven't even gotten
[43:33.760 --> 43:41.200]  into this whole quadrant of news over here but we will before I get into
[43:41.200 --> 43:46.480]  Jorge Ramos recognizes historic nature of two GOP Latinos Latinos running for
[43:46.480 --> 43:53.520]  White House Hillary Clinton surprises with early attack on CEO pay more class
[43:53.520 --> 43:58.640]  warfare garbage we'll be breaking that down Auburn woman Sue's Bates College
[43:58.640 --> 44:03.800]  says chick flicks were expected she's calling it sexual harassment or
[44:03.800 --> 44:11.800]  discrimination because she expected the job to be playing tennis and watching
[44:11.800 --> 44:19.160]  chick flicks to be the executive assistant to the head of the school and
[44:19.160 --> 44:23.760]  so she's saying I don't want to work I want to party and I actually have a
[44:23.760 --> 44:28.920]  lawsuit here this is mainstream news Sun Journal this reads like the onion but
[44:28.920 --> 44:34.040]  it's real serious well she's a woman and she feels harassed because she has to
[44:34.040 --> 44:44.120]  work like the woman that called the police because her big Mac was cold so
[44:44.120 --> 44:47.600]  they arrested her for a false police report people are really becoming
[44:47.600 --> 44:57.200]  delusional that's the type of news I have Dutch anti-Islam MP rallies German
[44:57.200 --> 45:01.440]  protesters we're gonna look at that now they're trying to ban that we're going
[45:01.440 --> 45:04.560]  to look at this huge story Bundy Ranch type standoff brewing in southern
[45:04.560 --> 45:08.720]  Oregon it's one of the oldest gold mines in the United States and it's
[45:08.720 --> 45:14.400]  privately owned and without law the BLM is just ordering them in letters under
[45:14.400 --> 45:17.760]  their authority because they're God come like Obama you know opening the borders
[45:17.760 --> 45:23.280]  up or launching new wars because he says so or shutting off power plants now the
[45:23.280 --> 45:27.520]  BLM is just saying you will shut down so that's the new Bundy Ranch situation
[45:27.520 --> 45:36.960]  heating up we'll break all of that down but I want to drill into National Guard
[45:36.960 --> 45:41.880]  riot drill features angry right wingers as roleplayers first and tie that into
[45:41.880 --> 45:45.120]  the latest news I already mentioned it but I want to drill into this first then
[45:45.120 --> 45:48.280]  I'll continue with news in the next hour open the phones up right into the
[45:48.280 --> 45:56.200]  third hour but first off we got a few thousand bottles of this as a test to
[45:56.200 --> 45:59.640]  see how the listeners like it obviously always going to be carrying it it's a
[45:59.640 --> 46:02.840]  very high quality product and we're almost sold out of these and it'll be

[46:08.480 --> 46:12.920]  we get that so that's always a marketing ploy one of the most popular ones to
[46:12.920 --> 46:17.600]  say we're selling out to create the perception of scarcity but there really
[46:17.600 --> 46:22.760]  will be scarcity with child ease it is the leading formula in the country

[54:46.360 --> 54:52.800]  just accelerating out in the open and then meanwhile National Guard riot drill
[54:52.800 --> 54:56.680]  features angry right wingers as roleplayers this is the drill that we
[54:56.680 --> 55:03.360]  were banned from in Richmond by San Francisco same place I went to in the
[55:03.360 --> 55:09.840]  year 1999 for urban warrior 2000 and I watched the Marines with foreign troops
[55:09.840 --> 55:13.600]  trained with roleplayers screaming I'm an America no not the camp please don't
[55:13.600 --> 55:19.440]  take my guns man made a two hour film up close showing the Marines doing it and a
[55:19.440 --> 55:25.240]  bunch of people watch it and said I had hired actors it couldn't be real
[55:25.240 --> 55:28.320]  Rick link later told me that story about another director telling him that
[55:28.320 --> 55:32.720]  can't be real and he he actually had people that work for him out there he
[55:32.720 --> 55:36.160]  said who were actually hired as roleplayers to do it
[55:36.160 --> 55:39.360]  course it was in the news they were doing the drills it was Marines trained to
[55:39.360 --> 55:42.760]  fight overseas you get there they were trained to take on the American people
[55:42.760 --> 55:48.840]  and I'll have it in video the armored vehicles the the Coronado landing the
[55:48.840 --> 55:53.440]  landing ships and the public back in 2000 said when the film came out they
[55:53.440 --> 55:57.160]  said that's not real just like when we gave you the document six and a half
[55:57.160 --> 56:00.840]  years ago saying gun owners veterans conservatives libertarians we broke that
[56:00.840 --> 56:05.680]  are the number one enemy people said it's fake it's a hoax now people go well

[01:01:11.920 --> 01:01:16.080]  citizen I don't recognize you that's the cue for them to be Billy Club while the
[01:01:16.080 --> 01:01:19.760]  feds you can see the Homeland Security guys and their khakis and black shirts
[01:01:19.760 --> 01:01:24.800]  overseeing their minions of course in a real battle I wonder what happened to the
[01:01:24.800 --> 01:01:35.040]  fella in the black shirt commanding him you idiots of course the larger plan is
[01:01:35.040 --> 01:01:40.440]  to get a civil war going that'll take out both sides because we're all a bunch
[01:01:40.440 --> 01:01:50.800]  of morons if we have this stupid civil war oh my gosh it's ridiculous it's those
[01:01:50.800 --> 01:01:55.280]  but you know what we like to follow authority and as a bunch of jack boots
[01:01:55.280 --> 01:01:58.920]  up there in Hillary's level or the federal level say do it you know they'll
[01:01:58.920 --> 01:02:03.440]  do it Fox News will come out when they blow up federal buildings and blame it
[01:02:03.440 --> 01:02:06.800]  on us and say the Patriots did it and turn on the libertarian movement in two
[01:02:06.800 --> 01:02:14.040]  seconds they'll be sitting there dumbfounded is the opposition to the
[01:02:14.040 --> 01:02:23.280]  takeover of America is framed for the false flags and at that moment if we
[01:02:23.280 --> 01:02:27.800]  don't hit the streets in mass with banner hangs and posters everywhere and
[01:02:27.800 --> 01:02:30.840]  getting the word out even if they shut the internet off you can create the
[01:02:30.840 --> 01:02:34.640]  simple graphic saying the government's been taken over criminal stage the
[01:02:34.640 --> 01:02:36.800]  attack
[01:02:39.440 --> 01:02:46.920]  encouraging others to take action I mean of a hundred citizens per city scale
[01:02:46.920 --> 01:02:50.920]  billboards you can turn those into your own message system the enemy so badly
[01:02:50.920 --> 01:02:54.360]  court into they'll never be able to expunge all the truth will you will use
[01:02:54.360 --> 01:02:58.480]  basic nonviolent French resisting tactics they had violent and nonviolent
[01:02:58.480 --> 01:03:04.920]  now that'll just get the word out daring this whole operation and it's it's
[01:03:04.920 --> 01:03:11.160]  not it's not gonna fly dogs not gonna hunt boats not gonna float
[01:03:13.800 --> 01:03:18.880]  and I think the system knows that I think they know that we've blown wide open
[01:03:18.880 --> 01:03:27.800]  and others have blown wide open these false flags over and over again and you
[01:03:27.800 --> 01:03:30.520]  know a lot of people that are only in the alternative media because they want
[01:03:30.520 --> 01:03:33.080]  to be famous or successful and there's nothing wrong with that in the final
[01:03:33.080 --> 01:03:38.360]  equation they're just not as effective because they don't have the energy to
[01:03:38.360 --> 01:03:44.000]  keep doing it because they really take it personal so they end up quitting because
[01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:48.200]  they don't get all the fame and fortune they wanted when it's not about fame
[01:03:48.200 --> 01:03:53.080]  and fortune it's about defending humanity but I tell you most people that
[01:03:53.080 --> 01:03:56.880]  are like that would be upset by seeing other people understanding how things
[01:03:56.880 --> 01:04:01.860]  work and putting out news that's popular with the people not me when I see
[01:04:01.860 --> 01:04:06.440]  hundreds of websites and hundreds of other people prominently coming up with
[01:04:06.440 --> 01:04:10.040]  just as good as reports as we are breaking major news we just link to
[01:04:10.040 --> 01:04:17.880]  their stuff and promote them because it's not about being the big enchilada as
[01:04:17.880 --> 01:04:21.280]  much as I get upset about how Glenn Beck lies about me and attacks me he does a
[01:04:21.280 --> 01:04:27.480]  lot of good overall so thank God he's there exposing agenda 21 and the New

[01:04:36.640 --> 01:04:42.400]  he's got surrounding him whatever he's still not openly against the people like

[01:11:09.920 --> 01:11:13.920]  see some of the commandos that they're sending to get us but see they're not
[01:11:13.920 --> 01:11:18.560]  meant to beat us they're just meant to chew everything up and be a simulant for
[01:11:18.560 --> 01:11:22.800]  war so the globalist can stage terror attacks in the civil war and claim we're
[01:11:22.800 --> 01:11:27.920]  doing blow-up infrastructure yeah yeah yeah let's hear some of the Obama
[01:11:27.920 --> 01:11:31.040]  brigades right now there and you laugh it's in the New York Times that these
[01:11:31.040 --> 01:11:44.040]  very guys train to take on gun owners and veterans
[01:11:44.040 --> 01:12:02.040]  because of Obama I'm the next lawyer because of Obama I'm inspired to be the
[01:12:02.040 --> 01:12:07.120]  next engineer because of Obama I'm inspired to be the next bar hey what's
[01:12:07.120 --> 01:12:12.400]  that Obama corps they wear the red jackets and they go this is what I wear
[01:12:12.400 --> 01:12:16.440]  the I mean that it's in there too it's really creepy it's a PSA here here let's
[01:12:16.440 --> 01:12:20.640]  go back to them when they do the karate chop stuff go ahead I'm pretty scared
[01:12:20.640 --> 01:12:30.440]  right now
[01:12:30.440 --> 01:12:44.200]  hey can we queue up Obama's signature national security forces as big and
[01:12:44.200 --> 01:12:48.440]  just as strong as our military which is the federalized police within their
[01:12:48.440 --> 01:12:53.320]  little brigade spy tattletail grips made up of the Boy Scouts and these
[01:12:53.320 --> 01:12:56.160]  groups and I'm not knocking the Boy Scouts but I can show you the New York
[01:12:56.160 --> 01:13:00.000]  Times and hundreds of other articles where it shows the Girl Scouts and Boy
[01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:04.000]  Scouts training to quote take on veterans and gun owners and the Tea Party
[01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:07.480]  going back six years
[01:13:08.360 --> 01:13:14.760]  we cannot continue to rely only on our military in order to achieve the national
[01:13:14.760 --> 01:13:18.960]  security objectives that we've set we've got to have a civilian national
[01:13:18.960 --> 01:13:25.760]  security force that's just as powerful just as strong just as well funded our
[01:13:25.760 --> 01:13:31.520]  military accounts for 50 plus percent of global defense spending so they want
[01:13:31.520 --> 01:13:35.840]  something as big as the largest military in the world domestically for us and the
[01:13:35.840 --> 01:13:39.400]  enemy designated is the Constitution the Bible the Declaration of
[01:13:39.400 --> 01:13:45.560]  Independence and any great man I mean you can go read the Army training manual
[01:13:45.560 --> 01:13:50.920]  mainstream news it's on info wars.com I mean you can't make this up George
[01:13:50.920 --> 01:13:54.680]  Washington quote wouldn't be welcome in today's army yeah because he actually
[01:13:54.680 --> 01:14:00.600]  founded it and actually led troops in battle in in hundreds of battles and had
[01:14:00.600 --> 01:14:03.520]  incredible prowess people all around him would get shot everybody was shooting
[01:14:03.520 --> 01:14:07.360]  at him and then he would just ride out there like a Trenton his hat had a
[01:14:07.360 --> 01:14:12.160]  bullet holes holes in his uniform yeah I guess he wouldn't be welcome in today's
[01:14:12.160 --> 01:14:17.400]  army. These people are total criminal traders and and they just run around
[01:14:17.400 --> 01:14:21.720]  bossing everyone with his helpless general public and you go down to UT you
[01:14:21.720 --> 01:14:26.240]  go out to LA where our reporters have been and you go up to say we want to put
[01:14:26.240 --> 01:14:35.080]  all gun owners in slave camps and Mark Dice talks to 15 people and 14 of them go
[01:14:35.080 --> 01:14:38.640]  yeah and by the way some of them act educated they go listen you don't tell me
[01:14:38.640 --> 01:14:43.280]  man I'm sick of these people they'll sit back in a minute and take your pension
[01:14:43.280 --> 01:14:47.160]  fund in your business and put you in a lockup they'll even go put a uniform on
[01:14:47.160 --> 01:14:50.120]  and a bunch of cowards will chain you down and come in there and stomp your
[01:14:50.120 --> 01:14:55.200]  intestines out go down to UT and we say we want to abort kids up to age five
[01:14:55.200 --> 01:15:01.160]  you bet let's do it we want to take gun owners and put them in FEMA camps let's
[01:15:01.160 --> 01:15:06.440]  do it yes we can because they these people don't can't have a job they have no
[01:15:06.440 --> 01:15:11.480]  minds they just go to college forever and they just imagine the power and they
[01:15:11.480 --> 01:15:14.880]  had a White House petition with over 50,000 signatures to create communist
[01:15:14.880 --> 01:15:20.600]  militias to round up gun owners on the White House dot gov and they just dream
[01:15:20.600 --> 01:15:25.800]  of like some type of weird Soviet revolution against us I mean it's not
[01:15:25.800 --> 01:15:29.960]  directed out of Russia it's directed out of the Pentagon out of George Soros out
[01:15:29.960 --> 01:15:38.760]  of the big think tanks and Hillary goes we descend men to fund camps to teach
[01:15:38.760 --> 01:15:42.360]  him about diversity everybody laughs because what a weird statement no they're
[01:15:42.360 --> 01:15:45.040]  they're getting ready they got to hide it and play with you with their moral
[01:15:45.040 --> 01:15:50.080]  authority and get everybody in line they'll already take your kids if they're
[01:15:50.080 --> 01:15:53.920]  seen playing in the backyard they'll already come and take your kids now
[01:15:53.920 --> 01:15:57.920]  without even a law and say didn't inoculate them now they're passing laws to
[01:15:57.920 --> 01:16:01.520]  do it they're coming
[01:16:01.880 --> 01:16:07.320]  don't play games people they've conquered hundreds of other countries they'll
[01:16:07.320 --> 01:16:13.360]  conquer you if you don't understand they are your enemy 100% I'm just here
[01:16:13.360 --> 01:16:17.120]  calling them the enemy because they are tens of thousands of veterans and gun
[01:16:17.120 --> 01:16:22.640]  groups and Christian groups persecuted indicted arrested and they go on MSNBC
[01:16:22.640 --> 01:16:28.160]  and go of course we're persecuting you you're bad racist groups see I'm a racist
[01:16:28.160 --> 01:16:35.880]  according to them so I deserve to be locked up I've been dehumanized
[01:16:35.880 --> 01:16:44.040]  Dinesh the Sousa still in prison serving as ten months prison sentence for not
[01:16:44.040 --> 01:16:49.520]  even violating campaign law he pled guilty so wouldn't get ten years per
[01:16:49.520 --> 01:16:54.760]  count I get five friends to give money to a Senate campaign but Hillary can
[01:16:54.760 --> 01:16:59.400]  openly take tens of millions from Saudi Arabian princes publicly and the news
[01:16:59.400 --> 01:17:07.680]  ask is that legal this is how the new world order rolls and everybody that
[01:17:07.680 --> 01:17:10.720]  goes along with it in the government you're just empowering the whole stinking
[01:17:10.720 --> 01:17:16.440]  house of cards to come down because history shows it will come down let's
[01:17:16.440 --> 01:17:24.560]  go to this next clip Florida man flips off cops he's an Air Force veteran he
[01:17:24.560 --> 01:17:30.440]  ran for city commissioner and lost he flipped off the armored tank the LRAD
[01:17:30.440 --> 01:17:34.480]  so they chased him down 23-year-old Florida man who ran for city
[01:17:34.480 --> 01:17:37.800]  commissioner I bet money's a listener was pulled over by camouflage
[01:17:37.800 --> 01:17:41.600]  deputies in an armored car after he flipped them off with his middle finger
[01:17:41.600 --> 01:17:46.160]  Lucas Jewel said he was angry with the county sheriff's deputies were turning
[01:17:46.160 --> 01:17:49.600]  his town into Baghdad like military force after all Gainesville is a college
[01:17:49.600 --> 01:17:53.040]  town mostly filled University Florida students but deputies felt the need to
[01:17:53.040 --> 01:17:56.440]  dress up like soldiers because it was orange and blue weekend a three-day
[01:17:56.440 --> 01:18:00.240]  celebration of festivities highlighted by scrimmage football game between
[01:18:00.240 --> 01:18:03.120]  Florida Gators you know you might actually need to do that because
[01:18:03.120 --> 01:18:06.040]  society's degenerating the point is you should have left him alone for flipping
[01:18:06.040 --> 01:18:10.400]  you off and not acted like a thug I would even be worried if they had armored
[01:18:10.400 --> 01:18:14.040]  vehicles if they weren't for the American people and crushing free speech if
[01:18:14.040 --> 01:18:17.640]  they every once in a while had a standoff or something happening but no
[01:18:17.640 --> 01:18:21.320]  because I'm for the citizens having armored vehicles so cops whatever just
[01:18:21.320 --> 01:18:25.480]  don't try to restrict us let's go to the deputies pulling them over
[01:18:52.320 --> 01:19:00.720]  Mr. Jewel stand between the headlights where I told you to if I have to ask
[01:19:00.720 --> 01:19:05.840]  you again you will be put in handcuffs and arrested for resistance look at me
[01:19:05.840 --> 01:19:11.840]  do you understand thank you you didn't call it start back why do they take
[01:19:11.840 --> 01:19:17.800]  your pension from cop now mr. Jewel the reason that you're being stopped is for
[01:19:17.800 --> 01:19:23.120]  improper hand signal which I don't know anything about a Supreme Court ruling
[01:19:23.120 --> 01:19:27.960]  that you can flick a cop off what I do know about that extending your arm out
[01:19:27.960 --> 01:19:34.120]  the driver's side window of a vehicle and flicking somebody off as an improper
[01:19:34.120 --> 01:19:39.240]  hand signal and again it does stir up trouble and I wouldn't have done it but
[01:19:39.240 --> 01:19:43.480]  people are getting mad because the government above you is wallace shutting
[01:19:43.480 --> 01:19:47.640]  off the power plants shutting off our industry opening the borders completely
[01:19:47.640 --> 01:19:54.400]  out launching all these wars people are sick of it we're tired of it we know the

[01:24:32.840 --> 01:24:38.840]  here in just a moment and then come out talk to Biggs and then go back to your
[01:24:38.840 --> 01:24:43.560]  calls and then we've got a lot of other important news up on info wars comm and
[01:24:43.560 --> 01:24:49.840]  prisonplanet.com if you look at one of our major YouTube channels it has 495
[01:24:49.840 --> 01:24:53.520]  million views you add that together with our other official channels we have
[01:24:53.520 --> 01:24:57.600]  about 700 million views and you add that to all the other channels that carry
[01:24:57.600 --> 01:25:03.840]  our material it's really over a billion I always tend to underestimate but MSNBC
[01:25:03.840 --> 01:25:08.120]  said last year 300 million it's it's it's it's more like a billion those more
[01:25:08.120 --> 01:25:13.240]  like 800 million back then but what I'm getting at here is our Twitter though
[01:25:13.240 --> 01:25:17.680]  only has 300,000 followers our Facebook's only about two and a half million our
[01:25:17.680 --> 01:25:23.880]  main Facebook under a million and that's because it's all gained we don't have
[01:25:23.880 --> 01:25:29.080]  any fake followers Hillary and it's turned out Obama and others 90 plus
[01:25:29.080 --> 01:25:34.360]  percent that's mainstream news look it up other Twitter followers are fake they're
[01:25:34.360 --> 01:25:37.800]  just given them by Twitter and Facebook they're just given other people's
[01:25:37.800 --> 01:25:42.200]  Twitter accounts but it's folks that really aren't active so it's all an
[01:25:42.200 --> 01:25:46.920]  illusion we really have two and a half million Facebook followers we really
[01:25:46.920 --> 01:25:53.000]  have 300,000 people on Twitter I came to Twitter late fans made the sites I
[01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:56.080]  never promoted until a few years ago so if you got in early it got bigger we
[01:25:56.080 --> 01:25:59.440]  people to follow us at real Alex Jones because we really send you breaking news
[01:25:59.440 --> 01:26:02.840]  breaking video you name it but the big issue is the reason you also need to
[01:26:02.840 --> 01:26:06.760]  support us is they're doing everything they can to game it remember the Navy
[01:26:06.760 --> 01:26:09.800]  Seals groups that were exposing Benghazi kept having their Facebooks and
[01:26:09.800 --> 01:26:12.880]  Twitter shut down or they wouldn't let them promote a meme every time we have
[01:26:12.880 --> 01:26:16.240]  some meme that's getting hundreds of thousands of shares is about to hit
[01:26:16.240 --> 01:26:22.280]  millions they kill it that's why if you go to other people's YouTube channels
[01:26:22.280 --> 01:26:25.720]  that are small they'll have videos with like a thousand views ten thousand views
[01:26:25.720 --> 01:26:28.960]  that an Alex Jones video with a million and a half eight hundred thousand three
[01:26:28.960 --> 01:26:33.760]  million views four million views three hundred thousand views because they don't
[01:26:33.760 --> 01:26:37.320]  have governors on those nobody sites and I'm not saying you're a nobody that's how
[01:26:37.320 --> 01:26:41.580]  they see it there's governors slapped on that when we hit a peak the algorithm
[01:26:41.580 --> 01:26:46.880]  cuts off we've talked to top consultants people inside Google this is how they
[01:26:46.880 --> 01:26:52.000]  operate Hillary critic says her campaign paid to have hashtags removed and
[01:26:52.000 --> 01:27:02.720]  again can we punch up my YouTube about page for folks and maybe maybe just go
[01:27:02.720 --> 01:27:05.360]  there yourself and put on screen because people can't see that where the
[01:27:05.360 --> 01:27:09.720]  cameras aimed on it I want to zoom in on the million subscribers and the four
[01:27:09.720 --> 01:27:13.200]  hundred ninety five thousand views I mean four hundred ninety five million
[01:27:13.200 --> 01:27:19.160]  plus views Hillary there was a viral hashtag getting millions of retweets an
[01:27:19.160 --> 01:27:24.400]  hour yesterday hashtag why I'm not voting for Hillary mainly by liberals
[01:27:24.400 --> 01:27:29.480]  upset with what a tyrant she is she just paid turned him an article about it
[01:27:29.480 --> 01:27:33.040]  critic says campaign paid to have hashtag removed and they didn't we look
[01:27:33.040 --> 01:27:36.160]  they just removed it social media now plays an instrumental role in political
[01:27:36.160 --> 01:27:39.920]  campaigns that's why Zuckerberg and others at Facebook and Twitter they
[01:27:39.920 --> 01:27:43.760]  meet with the Clintons they meet with the communist Chinese their head of
[01:27:43.760 --> 01:27:48.080]  censorship a few months ago to learn how to do this so that's how they're trying
[01:27:48.080 --> 01:27:52.320]  to game it but it's not working they can't stop you at the low intensity level
[01:27:52.320 --> 01:27:55.880]  reposting our videos giving them to friends and family and that leads me to
[01:27:55.880 --> 01:28:00.880]  this point right here you go to our main YouTube channel the Alex Jones channel
[01:28:00.880 --> 01:28:04.200]  that I've been in lawsuits to keep up okay I mean that you know I mean I've
[01:28:04.200 --> 01:28:08.880]  been in battles with people just to keep this up so I mean it's and I'm not
[01:28:08.880 --> 01:28:12.360]  complaining this is a war we get stronger every time we learn how the system
[01:28:12.360 --> 01:28:17.600]  works there's a video we put out yesterday that only has 35,000 views it
[01:28:17.600 --> 01:28:21.400]  should have 10 million views by now of course they put a governor on it but
[01:28:21.400 --> 01:28:25.400]  regardless get it repost it to your channel make copies of it air it on your
[01:28:25.400 --> 01:28:29.640]  local radio show don't let them stop you the video the feds don't want you to
[01:28:29.640 --> 01:28:32.920]  see we're gonna retweet it at real Alex Jones we're gonna post it back to
[01:28:32.920 --> 01:28:40.680]  Facebook right now and it's the 14 minutes or so epic stand down of the
[01:28:40.680 --> 01:28:44.240]  feds last year and why it was so important why the Bundy Ranch is the
[01:28:44.240 --> 01:28:50.240]  second shot heard around the world it's a very important video and it needs to be
[01:28:50.240 --> 01:28:54.960]  seen so let's do a test the power of the people go to info wars com to that page
[01:28:54.960 --> 01:28:59.240]  where it's being reposted right now go to Twitter go to Facebook retweet it
[01:28:59.240 --> 01:29:03.880]  post on your Facebook email it out let's see if we can push that up over a
[01:29:03.880 --> 01:29:08.320]  million our last Bundy Ranch video has a million 400,000 views and I mean
[01:29:08.320 --> 01:29:11.920]  that's a big deal the stat listen Hillary can't get a couple thousand views on
[01:29:11.920 --> 01:29:15.720]  her things Obama's videos on the White House site on average about 5,000 views
[01:29:15.720 --> 01:29:21.720]  they're a joke we're dominating what I'm trying to do is get the audience in the
[01:29:21.720 --> 01:29:25.000]  mindset of realizing you're the power of the show the reason we reached 20
[01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:28.440]  million people a week is because you're taking action but it's a fraction of you
[01:29:28.440 --> 01:29:33.720]  that are really active what if more of you tell folks about our M&M stations in
[01:29:33.720 --> 01:29:37.440]  your area what if you get an ad in the paper telling folks about tuning into
[01:29:37.440 --> 01:29:40.800]  the show what if you put up a billboard what if you hand out cards of friends
[01:29:40.800 --> 01:29:44.240]  and family what if you buy the products I mean that's how you support the
[01:29:44.240 --> 01:29:49.320]  transmission you have the power you take action you're unstoppable we're on the

[01:33:33.040 --> 01:33:38.760]  to you from FEMA region six formerly Texas Austin we've been taken over by
[01:33:38.760 --> 01:33:41.800]  foreign banks they're openly training the military to take on gun owners
[01:33:41.800 --> 01:33:45.600]  veterans conservatives libertarians they're publicly teaching the military
[01:33:45.600 --> 01:33:49.360]  that George Washington's bad that the Bible and Constitution is bad it's now
[01:33:49.360 --> 01:33:54.720]  being taught Pentagon and army-wide even to enlisted that's daily caller today the
[01:33:54.720 --> 01:33:59.160]  Bible is listed as racist and evil this is just the takeover and they're not
[01:33:59.160 --> 01:34:06.280]  gonna stop meanwhile we have some of the most incredible news ever judicial watch
[01:34:06.280 --> 01:34:10.880]  highly respected they get four-year documents I've never seen judicial watch
[01:34:10.880 --> 01:34:19.480]  where they were putting out Bravo Sierra and talking to Joe Biggs last year when
[01:34:19.480 --> 01:34:23.440]  he went down there to the border we wanted to kind of do an ode to the
[01:34:23.440 --> 01:34:28.960]  Veritas project who crosses an ISIS fighter from Canada across the Great
[01:34:28.960 --> 01:34:32.480]  Lakes and then basically went in and you know simulated an attack on a public
[01:34:32.480 --> 01:34:38.200]  place with bio weapons Joe Biggs crossed the Rio Grande right where he thought
[01:34:38.200 --> 01:34:42.320]  they'd probably try to cross because it's so easy to come in in the middle at a
[01:34:42.320 --> 01:34:47.400]  city park on the edge of El Paso and and he said this is that place that he
[01:34:47.400 --> 01:34:50.640]  would cross now last year it was being rumored by Border Patrol and ice that
[01:34:50.640 --> 01:34:54.960]  there was radical Islamist jihadis training over there since then they've
[01:34:54.960 --> 01:34:58.240]  arrested a bunch of them and judicial watch is confirmed on both sides of the
[01:34:58.240 --> 01:35:02.480]  border with the FBI said a month ago ISIS is operating in all 50 states there's a
[01:35:02.480 --> 01:35:06.240]  major recruiting drive Saudi Arabia behind it the same folks Saudi Arabia
[01:35:06.240 --> 01:35:10.760]  quarterbacking 9-11 that's in the New York Post today how the FBI is white
[01:35:10.760 --> 01:35:16.080]  washing the Saudi connection in 9-11 told you that 14 years ago where are the
[01:35:16.080 --> 01:35:20.600]  apologies to me folks that's your inside job part of it why is the FBI covering
[01:35:20.600 --> 01:35:24.840]  it up because if it comes out what Senator Graham and others are saying
[01:35:24.840 --> 01:35:31.720]  it's over for the globalist and so let's specifically go to the New York Post
[01:35:31.720 --> 01:35:38.000]  because that's out today how the FBI is white washing the Saudi connection to
[01:35:38.000 --> 01:35:43.720]  9-11 that same paper has criticized me and we're not trying to defend ourselves
[01:35:43.720 --> 01:35:47.040]  here we don't need to we just want to remind you that that the truth does end
[01:35:47.040 --> 01:35:52.680]  up coming out as the Bible states now we're going to go over what I covered
[01:35:52.680 --> 01:35:55.840]  last hour of your new viewer or listener and I'm up here claiming that they came
[01:35:55.840 --> 01:36:00.240]  onto the Bible's racist and sexist the army now teaches that in official
[01:36:00.240 --> 01:36:05.480]  manuals we're going to go over that meanwhile ISIS is coming into the US
[01:36:05.480 --> 01:36:12.840]  we've had real credible threats ourselves by real groups I mean these are
[01:36:12.840 --> 01:36:17.280]  concerned to quote law enforcement they're threatening all sorts of media
[01:36:17.280 --> 01:36:20.320]  they're now putting out videos they're gonna blow up the White House and all
[01:36:20.320 --> 01:36:24.880]  the rest of this and take over the US and launch it in 9-11 the FBI said all
[01:36:24.880 --> 01:36:28.560]  50 states last month are infiltrated now whether this is real or a false flag
[01:36:28.560 --> 01:36:32.720]  they don't need to false flag ISIS is a real group being funded and protected
[01:36:32.720 --> 01:36:37.480]  but they're real crazies on the ground I don't know how they're gonna have open
[01:36:37.480 --> 01:36:39.800]  borders and then pull something off like this and I have the government getting
[01:36:39.800 --> 01:36:43.320]  in trouble but Joe rams me about 15 minutes ago and he said look at this
[01:36:43.320 --> 01:36:49.480]  from judicial watch ISIS camp a few miles from Texas Mexican authorities
[01:36:49.480 --> 01:36:54.640]  confirm ISIS is operating a camp just a few miles from El Paso Texas according
[01:36:54.640 --> 01:36:58.760]  judicial watch sources that include a Mexican army field great officer and a
[01:36:58.760 --> 01:37:02.920]  Mexican federal police inspector the exact location of terrorist group has
[01:37:02.920 --> 01:37:06.400]  established its base is around eight miles from the US border in an area
[01:37:06.400 --> 01:37:12.240]  known as Ann Arpa situated just between Juarez in the Mexican state of Chihuahua
[01:37:12.240 --> 01:37:20.320]  another ISIS cell is west of Juarez in Porto Palomas targets the New Mexico
[01:37:20.320 --> 01:37:27.240]  towns of Columbus and Deming for easy access the United States the same
[01:37:27.240 --> 01:37:31.600]  acknowledged source confirmed and it goes on from there and of course they
[01:37:31.600 --> 01:37:37.440]  can also attack Fort Bliss now Joe Biggs is going to deploy in the Info War
[01:37:37.440 --> 01:37:42.120]  today down there and we've got sources in ice for petroleum and we've got
[01:37:42.120 --> 01:37:46.680]  sources with aircraft that are legally able to fly to Mexico Joe says he wants
[01:37:46.680 --> 01:37:51.480]  to go in and try to discover the base himself and I'm trying to talk him down
[01:37:51.480 --> 01:37:54.720]  from actually going in on the ground but I bet we can probably get with some
[01:37:54.720 --> 01:37:59.680]  people that we know and trust to go cover this it needs to be exposed a be
[01:37:59.680 --> 01:38:03.720]  fortune favors the bold and see it's going to be one hell of international
[01:38:03.720 --> 01:38:07.360]  story we can really catch them with their pants down because we know Obama's
[01:38:07.360 --> 01:38:10.720]  helping fund all this with the Muslim Brotherhood the rest of it it's part of
[01:38:10.720 --> 01:38:13.560]  some larger plan he could use terror attacks as a smoke screen to declare
[01:38:13.560 --> 01:38:20.800]  martial law Joe Biggs what's insane here is this is where you predicted that I
[01:38:20.800 --> 01:38:23.360]  said well where do you want to go to simulate this he goes well I would come
[01:38:23.360 --> 01:38:26.080]  through El Paso because the military base is there they might want to attack
[01:38:26.080 --> 01:38:30.920]  that and it's just right across and our sources say that it's wide open on the
[01:38:30.920 --> 01:38:34.000]  border patrol and they just let him walk across under orders and since then it's
[01:38:34.000 --> 01:38:38.720]  come out that they get reprimanded or fired if they even stop them so of
[01:38:38.720 --> 01:38:44.200]  course this is a protected corridor for Al Qaeda now known as ISIS I don't know
[01:38:44.200 --> 01:38:47.120]  how you predicted the exact spot we're going to play that report in a moment
[01:38:47.120 --> 01:38:50.200]  and then go to these callers some of them that disagree like Dave don't hang up
[01:38:50.200 --> 01:38:55.000]  Dave this is amazing Joe Biggs we're going to again play this video of where
[01:38:55.000 --> 01:38:58.000]  you simulated the beheading right there on the border to show it's wide open
[01:38:58.000 --> 01:39:01.880]  what is your take on this I mean like I said before I was stationed there for
[01:39:01.880 --> 01:39:05.040]  quite some time that's why I last served in the military that was my last duty
[01:39:05.040 --> 01:39:09.400]  station and when these reports came out about a year ago I'm sitting there
[01:39:09.400 --> 01:39:14.640]  thinking myself alright right around El Paso where would I come through and my
[01:39:14.640 --> 01:39:19.400]  prediction was Sunland Park which is just on the edge of that big gate that we
[01:39:19.400 --> 01:39:24.320]  showed you that was wide open it's just they open the gates it's just it's just
[01:39:24.320 --> 01:39:29.000]  west of that and it basically is just desert and there's no gate in that one
[01:39:29.000 --> 01:39:34.000]  area whatsoever it goes right across the Rio Grande and it's at the most waist
[01:39:34.000 --> 01:39:36.880]  deep in some areas and then the others like you see in the video coming up
[01:39:36.880 --> 01:39:42.040]  about ankle deep so it's a very easy area to cross and in this document right
[01:39:42.040 --> 01:39:47.640]  here it says between Santa Teresa and Sunland Park so that's the exact spot
[01:39:47.640 --> 01:39:53.600]  that I had of a 2,200 mile border you picked the exact spot that judicial
[01:39:53.600 --> 01:39:58.200]  watch the same folks that got thousands of bombshell documents the same folks
[01:39:58.200 --> 01:40:02.120]  that exposed at the FBI was ordered to stand down before 9-11 I mean this is
[01:40:02.120 --> 01:40:04.920]  this they're very credible because the amount of the corruption that happens
[01:40:04.920 --> 01:40:08.160]  out there to the amount that the fact that they're letting all these illegals
[01:40:08.160 --> 01:40:11.160]  come through and they're trying to exploit that they know that that is a
[01:40:11.160 --> 01:40:14.960]  number one spot that you know word travels fast out there and that's where
[01:40:14.960 --> 01:40:19.520]  all these illegals are coming up through because there's so much interaction
[01:40:19.520 --> 01:40:23.280]  between people who live in wires who work in El Paso they go back to ours so
[01:40:23.280 --> 01:40:26.640]  there's a huge amount of traffic in between that area so I mean that would
[01:40:26.640 --> 01:40:30.520]  be the key spot if anyone was going to do it to go to well I've seen a lot of
[01:40:30.520 --> 01:40:35.120]  controlled left that poses his right wing libertarian medium always saying
[01:40:35.120 --> 01:40:38.160]  there's no al-Qaeda there's no ISIS there's none there's none when it's just
[01:40:38.160 --> 01:40:42.120]  rucksacks and literature and there I mean the numbers are in the thousands
[01:40:42.120 --> 01:40:46.800]  every month from the released ice numbers that have been mainstream news of
[01:40:46.800 --> 01:40:51.560]  others than Mexicans that are Islamists coming in well the Mexican army says
[01:40:51.560 --> 01:40:55.280]  that they discovered documents in Arabic and Urdu as well as plans for Fort
[01:40:55.280 --> 01:40:58.160]  Bliss the sprawling military installation the house of the US Army's first
[01:40:58.160 --> 01:41:01.960]  armoured division which is what I was a part of and the Muslim prayer rugs were
[01:41:01.960 --> 01:41:06.880]  discovered in documents with documents during this operation just a week ago so
[01:41:06.880 --> 01:41:09.880]  they're fine all this stuff it's happening it's right at the border we've
[01:41:09.880 --> 01:41:14.160]  been saying this forever that this is so insecure meanwhile we have all these
[01:41:14.160 --> 01:41:19.000]  people with technology who are bringing it to the you know to Washington saying
[01:41:19.000 --> 01:41:22.560]  hey we've got these ideas we've got this technology that can help secure the
[01:41:22.560 --> 01:41:26.280]  border and they were rejecting it all and let's go further this is the Washington
[01:41:26.280 --> 01:41:30.720]  Times today terror targets US troops urged to keep low-profile avoid military
[01:41:30.720 --> 01:41:34.880]  swaying in public so they're telling him secretly attacks are imminent the FBI
[01:41:34.880 --> 01:41:38.360]  says they're in all 50 states but in all these military drills including the
[01:41:38.360 --> 01:41:42.320]  dirty bomb drill you were banned from we get the video and it's trying to take on
[01:41:42.320 --> 01:41:46.840]  gun owners and patriots they admit it was a drill I guess where we supposedly
[01:41:46.840 --> 01:41:51.720]  dirty bomb so we're the threat not ISIS that Obama helped find and they're
[01:41:51.720 --> 01:41:56.560]  letting them come through they let ISIS come in and they restrain us they
[01:41:56.560 --> 01:42:02.640]  practiced and they tried to set up all of these programs within the country to
[01:42:02.640 --> 01:42:06.520]  just make us look bad you know these guys all these movies were the patriots
[01:42:06.520 --> 01:42:11.680]  gonna blow things up it's mind-blowing I mean like I've said before when you go
[01:42:11.680 --> 01:42:15.840]  and fight for a country I mean you're willing to sacrifice your life because
[01:42:15.840 --> 01:42:19.880]  you believe in something and to come back and to find out that you are now a
[01:42:19.880 --> 01:42:24.640]  bigger threat you're now listed as the number one terror threat Joe you are
[01:42:24.640 --> 01:42:27.360]  listed as number one enemy it's disgusting well you know why because
[01:42:27.360 --> 01:42:30.040]  you're willing to stand up against it yeah they know you're willing to go and
[01:42:30.040 --> 01:42:34.000]  expose what's happening you are the enemy I mean it's just because we're not
[01:42:34.000 --> 01:42:38.280]  traitors we're bad we're not here to just be told what to do and have our
[01:42:38.280 --> 01:42:41.000]  destiny controlled by a bunch of criminals that want to abuse us we don't
[01:42:41.000 --> 01:42:45.160]  want to obama care we don't want to turn our guns in we don't want to have a
[01:42:45.160 --> 01:42:50.080]  hundred percent taxation we're bad because we have some free will I want to
[01:42:50.080 --> 01:42:53.720]  go to your report and guys put the YouTube up on screen before we play the
[01:42:53.720 --> 01:42:56.680]  video we can because I want to show the date of this when did you go down there
[01:42:56.680 --> 01:43:01.960]  if you remember I don't remember the exact day it was I went a couple times
[01:43:01.960 --> 01:43:05.640]  we're gonna pull it up if you just go to YouTube and type in the video a man
[01:43:05.640 --> 01:43:11.240]  simulates beheading on Mexico Mexican Texas border you can find it man crosses
[01:43:11.240 --> 01:43:15.320]  U.S. border dresses ISIS terrorist simulates beheading and the date of that
[01:43:15.320 --> 01:43:21.480]  was September 5th 2014 so that was about eight nine months ago so simply
[01:43:21.480 --> 01:43:25.880]  amazing we predicted it you predicted it Joe you were the one that decided how to
[01:43:25.880 --> 01:43:29.600]  run the whole thing let's go ahead and go to this special report go ahead and
[01:43:29.600 --> 01:43:33.160]  get suited up get ready start looking into aircraft looking into our border
[01:43:33.160 --> 01:43:37.040]  patrol sources and you make the decision whether you can find someone that wants
[01:43:37.040 --> 01:43:40.160]  to go into one of those dangerous areas of Mexico with you on ground or you can
[01:43:40.160 --> 01:43:44.360]  try to get an aircraft that's already licensed to fly to Mexico as many hours
[01:43:44.360 --> 01:43:49.040]  as you need a prop plane or whatever get in there no expense is spared get in
[01:43:49.040 --> 01:43:52.920]  there find that al-qaeda base Roger that good job Joe Biggs deploying pray for him
[01:43:52.920 --> 01:43:57.080]  all right I tell you ladies and gentlemen this is the real deal let's go to him and
[01:43:57.080 --> 01:44:01.360]  our crew who went with you Josh Owens last time yeah say that guy's always in
[01:44:01.360 --> 01:44:04.600]  the thick of it here's their report from the border predicting eight months ago
[01:44:04.600 --> 01:44:12.040]  exactly what's now happening
[01:44:12.040 --> 01:44:15.040]  terror alert and believe in attack by the terrorist group
[01:44:15.040 --> 01:44:20.920]  ISIS is imminent on or before September 11 the 13th anniversary of the worst
[01:44:20.920 --> 01:44:25.800]  attack on American soil info wars investigates just miles from the
[01:44:25.800 --> 01:44:30.920]  center of El Paso Texas where we were able to cross the river from Mexico into
[01:44:30.920 --> 01:44:35.840]  America thousands of other than Mexicans cross our borders from over 75
[01:44:35.840 --> 01:44:40.560]  different countries info wars is showing you time and time again that our
[01:44:40.560 --> 01:44:45.800]  borders are intentionally left unsecured and now these ISIS psychopaths are
[01:44:45.800 --> 01:44:50.720]  ready to strike its targets on American soil we know our government has
[01:44:50.720 --> 01:44:55.720]  created and funded ISIS so whether or not this is a real threat or a false flag
[01:44:55.720 --> 01:45:00.880]  the globalists are now one step closer to their end game stripping us of all
[01:45:00.880 --> 01:45:05.080]  our liberties so we dressed up like an ISIS jihadi to be as obvious as
[01:45:05.080 --> 01:45:33.800]  possible to show and to illustrate just how wide open the border really is
[01:45:35.080 --> 01:46:04.960]  thank you Obama for leaving your son
[01:46:04.960 --> 01:46:11.360]  southern borders open so ISIS can terrorize America I should thank you
[01:46:11.360 --> 01:46:29.160]  president Obama we claim this land for surreal law if ISIS can enter America
[01:46:29.160 --> 01:46:32.760]  then anyone can and the borders are wide open we're being collapsed in the
[01:46:32.760 --> 01:46:36.960]  North American Union Stephanie Nancy Rick Mario we're gonna go to your calls
[01:46:36.960 --> 01:46:43.960]  right now but first off Dave in Missouri disagrees so he goes to the head of the
[01:46:43.960 --> 01:46:49.800]  line why does so many people from Missouri call their actual Clinton
[01:46:49.800 --> 01:46:57.800]  supporters Dave what do you disagree with well hello Alex how's it going is
[01:46:57.800 --> 01:47:03.280]  the same guy that went by the name Smitty well you said first-time callers
[01:47:03.280 --> 01:47:07.080]  and I tried to get through and they hung up on me so I had to call back and say
[01:47:07.080 --> 01:47:13.000]  that my name is Dave so you're so you lied to get on air well Alex you lie
[01:47:13.000 --> 01:47:17.120]  about everything that you you know say so why wouldn't I lie to get on the air
[01:47:17.120 --> 01:47:21.560]  I'm just you know taking cue from you my friend okay well we said first time
[01:47:21.560 --> 01:47:26.360]  callers but you're special we want to start having you on via Skype so you
[01:47:26.360 --> 01:47:30.360]  called yesterday under the name Smitty go ahead and what do you have to say
[01:47:30.360 --> 01:47:35.320]  about all this well first of all is Joe big really the best that you can
[01:47:35.320 --> 01:47:40.640]  possibly do out of everybody in the military you pick Joe big this guy is
[01:47:40.640 --> 01:47:46.400]  a knuckle-dragger he is he probably has about oh I don't know a 75 or 80 IQ and
[01:47:46.400 --> 01:47:51.120]  it's pretty ridiculous that you you know you would think that you know first of
[01:47:51.120 --> 01:47:55.120]  all it would be really difficult to get in it shows you know how how good your
[01:47:55.120 --> 01:47:58.960]  show really is and how many people you know really listen to your show I think
[01:47:58.960 --> 01:48:04.600]  you have a few illusions of grandeur mr. Jones first of all second of all yeah
[01:48:04.600 --> 01:48:09.320]  Joe big he's he's kind of a he's kind of a funny little guy I love his profile
[01:48:09.320 --> 01:48:13.600]  picture on Facebook though it kind of looks like a little boy to men motif and
[01:48:13.600 --> 01:48:19.360]  I think you should probably you know go and you you guys are a boy band I could
[01:48:19.360 --> 01:48:23.560]  probably be your producer if you want to do but you've got a lot of troop hating
[01:48:23.560 --> 01:48:29.000]  going on and you know why wouldn't you guys people like you be the number one
[01:48:29.000 --> 01:48:33.240]  terror threat if you you know the way that you talk about how much that's
[01:48:33.240 --> 01:48:36.560]  right the Tea Party has the lowest crime rate out there looking up to yourself
[01:48:36.560 --> 01:48:40.480]  so we're bad and you know we like free market and private property and freedom
[01:48:40.480 --> 01:48:46.360]  we're so evil Joe is a really smart guy and he was distinguished in the US Army
[01:48:46.360 --> 01:48:50.800]  as an enlisted person a rose of the ranks very quick and he's been wounded
[01:48:50.800 --> 01:48:54.760]  repeatedly in combat and I like hanging out with him and he's just a regular guy
[01:48:54.760 --> 01:48:59.040]  he doesn't have a bunch of pretensions like you and he's got courage and so
[01:48:59.040 --> 01:49:03.000]  that's why I hired him because he was the one that exposed the fact that they
[01:49:03.000 --> 01:49:07.600]  killed Hastings and then everything he said turned out to be true they murdered
[01:49:07.600 --> 01:49:11.680]  Michael Hastings his friend I said man you've already going to school for
[01:49:11.680 --> 01:49:15.640]  journalism you're about to graduate and our TF why don't you come down here and
[01:49:15.640 --> 01:49:20.640]  work for us that's the kind of people I'm looking for real regular people okay
[01:49:20.640 --> 01:49:24.160]  that's what we're looking for here is people that don't say they're left or
[01:49:24.160 --> 01:49:27.840]  right but that want freedom and then you call in with a bunch of names because
[01:49:27.840 --> 01:49:33.400]  you're not a real liberal you're a totalitarian on a power trip I'm
[01:49:33.400 --> 01:49:37.680]  absolutely a real liberal what do you mean I'm not a real liberal liberals that
[01:49:37.680 --> 01:49:41.400]  are out there are overriding every major freedom we've got power grabbing
[01:49:41.400 --> 01:49:46.840]  everything so you think it's good for the IRS to persecute the Tea Party and
[01:49:46.840 --> 01:49:52.000]  Christian groups absolutely those are the biggest most hateful groups that are
[01:49:52.000 --> 01:49:56.760]  out there why listen jackass even if they were hateful it's called the First
[01:49:56.760 --> 01:50:00.920]  Amendment do you understand selectively harassing people is the essence of
[01:50:00.920 --> 01:50:07.360]  tyranny so you're gonna try and tell me that when Republican gets in office
[01:50:07.360 --> 01:50:11.160]  they're not gonna do the exact same thing when Nixon did it he had to leave
[01:50:11.160 --> 01:50:15.280]  office Nixon did it he left office if Bush got caught doing this he'd be out
[01:50:15.280 --> 01:50:21.240]  of office I would absolutely be going after Bush for this I did go after Bush
[01:50:21.240 --> 01:50:26.120]  Nixon is absolutely ancient history you are such a child you are such a you
[01:50:26.120 --> 01:50:29.760]  think you get power because the Democratic Party commits all these crimes
[01:50:29.760 --> 01:50:33.640]  and like you're part of this big mafia and you feel tough you're a totalitarian
[01:50:33.640 --> 01:50:38.960]  wannabe you're not even one of the totalitarians I want to hear you own
[01:50:38.960 --> 01:50:43.000]  galactically you don't believe probably in spirituality I want you to own the
[01:50:43.000 --> 01:50:47.640]  persecution say God if this is true I don't want you to do it I join with the
[01:50:47.640 --> 01:50:51.720]  persecution of the innocent I think it's cute I mean because you I mean you own
[01:50:51.720 --> 01:50:55.120]  it you want to be part of this right skip the break too important skip the
[01:50:55.120 --> 01:50:59.800]  break we're skipping the break I don't believe I'm I sir I am I believe in
[01:50:59.800 --> 01:51:03.640]  science you don't believe in right and wrong so it's okay for you to persecute
[01:51:03.640 --> 01:51:07.680]  people but when you get persecuted it's persecution and you whine you're a you
[01:51:07.680 --> 01:51:10.520]  don't even have you're not even a moral relativist you don't even have common
[01:51:10.520 --> 01:51:18.640]  sense or logic you are the funniest man on the radio I just I laugh all the time
[01:51:18.640 --> 01:51:22.960]  when I listen to you because listen to this I laugh all these attacks that are
[01:51:22.960 --> 01:51:26.840]  designed for weak-minded people to think he's winning the debate when you be
[01:51:26.840 --> 01:51:30.520]  thrown out of debate for what you're doing you would be thrown out of debate
[01:51:30.520 --> 01:51:34.120]  for cutting me off every time I try and get a sentence out of my mouth no every
[01:51:34.120 --> 01:51:40.920]  time you spew another serpent-laden forked-tongue vomit basket okay I tell
[01:51:40.920 --> 01:51:44.600]  you what you got two minutes go ahead and spew more hatred to people all right
[01:51:44.600 --> 01:51:50.120]  that sounds good first of all like I was saying Joe Big kind of seems a little
[01:51:50.120 --> 01:51:55.120]  bit like a sissy but I bet you think he would be a really good friend to me and
[01:51:55.120 --> 01:52:01.400]  my roommate as like I said his Facebook picture is absolutely just fabulous he
[01:52:01.400 --> 01:52:08.800]  looked really nice and like I said you as a 19-year-old fabulous as well you
[01:52:08.800 --> 01:52:13.760]  know what are you gonna do if Hillary doesn't get the nomination and then
[01:52:13.760 --> 01:52:18.160]  Elizabeth Warren does because you hate women so much you're gonna you're going
[01:52:18.160 --> 01:52:23.400]  to hate Elizabeth Warren too until a bunch of lies about her as well because
[01:52:23.400 --> 01:52:27.240]  you hate women you hate Muslim you hate women you hate everybody who is not
[01:52:27.240 --> 01:52:32.400]  the exact same as you and it's very well here's the deal Elizabeth Warren does
[01:52:32.400 --> 01:52:34.760]  have the big globalist behind her because I know Hillary's pretty much in
[01:52:34.760 --> 01:52:40.040]  trouble and she's not as criminal as Hillary with her long record but she's
[01:52:40.040 --> 01:52:44.760]  been flip-flopping on a lot of issues and so I have a lot of problems with her
[01:52:44.760 --> 01:52:48.000]  and there's no way that she would actually follow her policies that she
[01:52:48.000 --> 01:52:54.080]  claims she supports because that's not what Wall Street wants but I don't detest
[01:52:54.080 --> 01:52:58.960]  Elizabeth Warren the senator no but it's because of her policies it has
[01:52:58.960 --> 01:53:04.680]  nothing to do with the fact that she's a woman I mean I mean that's a moral mind
[01:53:04.680 --> 01:53:10.480]  game thinking women are weak-minded that you say I don't like women so women are
[01:53:10.480 --> 01:53:14.360]  then gonna say I don't like Alex this guy claims he likes me you know I mean
[01:53:14.360 --> 01:53:18.880]  here's the deal you don't know about the company of women obviously Joe Biggs
[01:53:18.880 --> 01:53:22.760]  and I do so don't sit there and tell me what women want all day I know what they
[01:53:22.760 --> 01:53:27.920]  want believe me are you kidding me if you think that I don't have plenty of
[01:53:27.920 --> 01:53:31.640]  female friends that are no I bet you've got other fellow travelers that are
[01:53:31.640 --> 01:53:35.960]  isolated and don't have families and aren't happy and and hate humanity and
[01:53:35.960 --> 01:53:41.160]  and only like what isn't the standard genetic code of a mammal I understand you
[01:53:41.160 --> 01:53:46.360]  are a revolutionary against humanity because because you can't win within
[01:53:46.360 --> 01:53:50.680]  the paradigm of humanity that that is the natural paradigm so you construct
[01:53:50.680 --> 01:53:57.040]  artificial paradigms no that's false all I'm looking for is actual real unity I
[01:53:57.040 --> 01:54:02.440]  am a unity yeah yeah that's right let's have the IRS go and seize the bank
[01:54:02.440 --> 01:54:06.520]  accounts of Christian groups and tell the military you can't be in the tea
[01:54:06.520 --> 01:54:11.160]  party or evangelical Christian group or we will arrest you do you understand
[01:54:11.160 --> 01:54:15.480]  sir that that's like North Korea do you understand that's the opposite of
[01:54:15.480 --> 01:54:20.960]  classical liberalism to tell the military that you can't be a evangelical
[01:54:20.960 --> 01:54:25.960]  Christian or that you can't be in the tea party do you support that do you
[01:54:25.960 --> 01:54:32.720]  remember when the military my question you authoritarian I'm sorry would you
[01:54:32.720 --> 01:54:36.360]  repeat the question sir I couldn't understand is it good that Fort Hood told
[01:54:36.360 --> 01:54:40.400]  all of their army soldiers you cannot go to a tea party event or be part of
[01:54:40.400 --> 01:54:46.120]  evangelical group or you will be court marshal are have those claims even been
[01:54:46.120 --> 01:54:51.040]  substantiated sir we got the document from Fort Hood Fort Hood responded to the
[01:54:51.040 --> 01:54:56.080]  local paper and Fox News and basically defended it at first and then said we're
[01:54:56.080 --> 01:55:01.680]  gonna withdraw it for now and now it's back and it's in the news today hey you
[01:55:01.680 --> 01:55:07.000]  support second the IRS on the tea party you support second and on libertarian
[01:55:07.000 --> 01:55:11.040]  think tanks so is that where your tyranny stops do you support court
[01:55:11.040 --> 01:55:16.640]  marshaling people for their religious views answer the question answer the
[01:55:16.640 --> 01:55:23.120]  question I yeah would you stop screaming answer the question answer it no the
[01:55:23.120 --> 01:55:28.320]  answer is no and here's the thing yeah I'm just gonna try and settle down
[01:55:28.320 --> 01:55:32.200]  because uh you're you're kind of making me shake a little bit so let me take a
[01:55:32.200 --> 01:55:38.160]  deep breath haha okay is this for real what do you mean is this for real how can
[01:55:38.160 --> 01:55:43.040]  you how can you sit there and you if it's your opinion is okay you want it
[01:55:43.040 --> 01:55:48.240]  you're saying oh no no no my opinion is you can live however you want don't try
[01:55:48.240 --> 01:55:54.720]  to teach my five-year-olds how to suck a golf ball through a garden hose oh my
[01:55:54.720 --> 01:55:59.280]  goodness would you would you start to class up a little bit give me a break
[01:55:59.280 --> 01:56:06.200]  that's what's going on that's what's going on the schools yeah you if only
[01:56:06.200 --> 01:56:11.240]  you knew how much it actually did go on in the schools and how much I was
[01:56:11.240 --> 01:56:16.240]  shaping the mind of the youth of today and I'm sure you shape it when you get
[01:56:16.240 --> 01:56:20.480]  caught you get caught you're gonna get some major trouble oh so now you're
[01:56:20.480 --> 01:56:24.680]  gonna accuse me of things and that's just ridiculous I'm not accusing you
[01:56:24.680 --> 01:56:28.080]  like if you get caught you're gonna get trouble in the public court of public
[01:56:28.080 --> 01:56:32.880]  opinion now go ahead and catch yourself tell us what you done it's called common
[01:56:32.880 --> 01:56:38.640]  core it when we've it we've implemented the new system to show people how to
[01:56:38.640 --> 01:56:43.520]  think for themselves how to think independently and not have to conform to
[01:56:43.520 --> 01:56:50.480]  the traditional methods of conditioning it for just brainwashing it's
[01:56:50.480 --> 01:56:53.920]  ridiculous and I'm you're changing them two plus two equals whatever you say
[01:56:53.920 --> 01:56:58.880]  you're screwing them up yeah no that's not true that that's the simplificate
[01:56:58.880 --> 01:57:02.440]  and oversimplification of what's going on that's a complete oversimplification
[01:57:02.440 --> 01:57:09.000]  of what we're teaching no it's not we're teaching okay so I actually taught
[01:57:09.000 --> 01:57:13.840]  two plus two they actually teach fuzzy math what are you talking about no we
[01:57:13.840 --> 01:57:19.560]  teach how to do math problems by not using the traditional methods of you
[01:57:19.560 --> 01:57:23.360]  know writing them down on paper carry the one carry the two you take away ten
[01:57:23.360 --> 01:57:29.760]  you take away 70 and we show them how to you know make it you why would you want
[01:57:29.760 --> 01:57:33.520]  a school where you you have are criticized for getting a wrong answer so

[01:58:48.840 --> 01:58:55.320]  Hi I'm Alex Jones when I got on air 20 years ago I weighed 180 pounds I lift
[01:58:55.320 --> 01:58:59.880]  weights five days a week I could swim two three miles then I discovered the new
[01:58:59.880 --> 01:59:04.160]  world order the globalist their agenda I started an access television show I was
[01:59:04.160 --> 01:59:08.200]  so dedicated to my work and hanging around with radio guys that I began
[01:59:08.200 --> 01:59:14.080]  drinking I began smoking cigars and then even cigarettes I transformed from
[01:59:14.080 --> 01:59:19.400]  looking like a white Bruce Lee to looking like a job of the hut so I began a
[01:59:19.400 --> 01:59:24.760]  journey five years ago to shed the almost 100 pounds I started taking
[01:59:24.760 --> 01:59:30.120]  super male vitality and saw dramatic results in just a few weeks when I added

[02:00:08.880 --> 02:00:16.480]  cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio
[02:00:16.480 --> 02:00:23.400]  network and now live from Austin, Texas Alex Jones
[02:00:25.680 --> 02:00:29.560]  Steph Hahn in New York and Nancy Rick Mario and others thanks for holding her
[02:00:29.560 --> 02:00:36.840]  on the air go ahead all right I know you were questioning it that I was a real
[02:00:36.840 --> 02:00:41.680]  loser or fake loser but no he's a real loser I went to high school with these
[02:00:41.680 --> 02:00:47.560]  kids and that's how they that's exactly how they act see you got them when you
[02:00:47.560 --> 02:00:51.000]  I know I know loser Dave is still listening he's still talking about him
[02:00:51.000 --> 02:00:55.280]  but you got him when he said oh hang on let me take a deep breath because what
[02:00:55.280 --> 02:01:02.360]  happens is this they know that he got the sense that wait a minute if what this
[02:01:02.360 --> 02:01:06.360]  guy is saying is true then he has to drop on my whole entire argument so what
[02:01:06.360 --> 02:01:09.960]  they do is this when you do tell him something that they actually might come
[02:01:09.960 --> 02:01:13.200]  into the senses and be like wait a minute no I actually do think that that is
[02:01:13.200 --> 02:01:17.360]  wrong but I don't want to believe what you're saying because I just already
[02:01:17.360 --> 02:01:21.760]  want to write you off as and so that's why he says oh I don't know if that's
[02:01:21.760 --> 02:01:25.440]  even true but but then he's already saying he wants to basically arrest the
[02:01:25.440 --> 02:01:31.880]  tea party yeah and in the sense his whatever soul is still left in them
[02:01:31.880 --> 02:01:36.120]  kind of jumps out and says wait a minute hang on what he just said is
[02:01:36.120 --> 02:01:41.080]  actually wrong maybe Alex Jones is right maybe that that is a problem maybe
[02:01:41.080 --> 02:01:44.360]  that is something that I should look into but then the right then just the
[02:01:44.360 --> 02:01:47.920]  whole evil side that he's been brainwashed but I don't think that
[02:01:47.920 --> 02:01:50.760]  then you're gonna get that credit and it's just incredible and then your whole
[02:01:50.760 --> 02:01:57.280]  arguments gonna fall on top so these kind of kids they grew up see Dave you
[02:01:57.280 --> 02:02:02.080]  moron yes understand you're a new breed of liberalism see you weren't like the
[02:02:02.080 --> 02:02:05.960]  original liberals that Alex Jones was trying to tell you now what they're
[02:02:05.960 --> 02:02:10.240]  breeding is these new liberals where where everyone's a victim you're always a
[02:02:10.240 --> 02:02:14.080]  victim so what they do they're victims but they're elite and we're a mantle of
[02:02:14.080 --> 02:02:18.360]  royal roads that they're intellectuals and you're not and all they do is go
[02:02:18.360 --> 02:02:22.000]  you're racist I'm intellectual you're racist I'm intellectual Joe Biggs is a
[02:02:22.000 --> 02:02:26.000]  knuckle-dragger you're a trailer trash I'm an elitist you're scum and it's just
[02:02:26.000 --> 02:02:30.460]  like and in translation in translation what they're saying is oh you're a
[02:02:30.460 --> 02:02:34.000]  bully and I'm a victim you're a bully and I'm a victim so in their mind they
[02:02:34.000 --> 02:02:37.320]  think that they're always right because as long as they call you the bully then
[02:02:37.320 --> 02:02:40.960]  they're still the innocent victim the innocent by Stephen you're quite the
[02:02:40.960 --> 02:02:43.640]  philosopher you ought to launch a YouTube channel or something and describe
[02:02:43.640 --> 02:02:50.400]  this new mutated totalitarian that thinks it's liberal they know that they're
[02:02:50.400 --> 02:02:55.200]  totalitarians how do they not know that they're not even what they think they
[02:02:55.200 --> 02:03:00.520]  are because we grew up very spoiled because I can already tell that kid probably
[02:03:00.520 --> 02:03:04.240]  grew up on the East Coast somewhere maybe in the Midwest but probably on the
[02:03:04.240 --> 02:03:08.160]  East Coast or maybe even on another coast like in Cali but point is is this
[02:03:08.160 --> 02:03:11.560]  those kids they're they're very spoiled you have to think of like the spoiled
[02:03:11.560 --> 02:03:16.240]  kid who's who's rich who never really ran into a gang member who never really
[02:03:16.240 --> 02:03:20.160]  got into a confrontation they never got into a confrontation with the
[02:03:20.160 --> 02:03:23.760]  government where the government is treating them wrong see you're only
[02:03:23.760 --> 02:03:29.600]  smart enough to have read books and understand that this I understand that
[02:03:29.600 --> 02:03:34.320]  this stuff has now unfortunately with kids they've been brainwashed that they're
[02:03:34.320 --> 02:03:40.480]  a victim they've I mean this is a new breed of kids man and I'm seeing it you
[02:03:40.480 --> 02:03:45.280]  know I'm there these entitled spoiled brats that think you they owe you
[02:03:45.280 --> 02:03:48.720]  something and usually they're white and they come up to you and say we've got to
[02:03:48.720 --> 02:03:52.040]  get rid of all the white people you're a racist and you're just standing there
[02:03:52.040 --> 02:03:56.680]  you've done nothing and you go I don't want to abort the black people they go
[02:03:56.680 --> 02:04:02.200]  yeah yeah whatever I mean they just have no I mean I tell you people think the
[02:04:02.200 --> 02:04:06.080]  mark dice videos are fake we've been out there they're real people think ours are
[02:04:06.080 --> 02:04:10.680]  fake no we'll talk to ten trendies and nine of them will say let's kill babies
[02:04:10.680 --> 02:04:16.400]  up to age five or let's put gun owners in slave camps and then as long as you
[02:04:16.400 --> 02:04:23.520]  say for Obama I mean it's just and then they have the papers all over the
[02:04:23.520 --> 02:04:28.720]  country right about our abortion video saying it must not have been real or or
[02:04:28.720 --> 02:04:31.760]  or they went and found one woman who said yes abort the baby she was why I
[02:04:31.760 --> 02:04:34.640]  didn't really mean it because they're kind of having that moment of truth of
[02:04:34.640 --> 02:04:38.240]  themselves going wow we we really do want to kill kids up to age five now and
[02:04:38.240 --> 02:04:42.040]  we really want to put people in forced labor camps but but Jones is a cook
[02:04:42.040 --> 02:04:47.440]  because he got us to say it no you said it look in the mirror thank you so much

[02:11:55.600 --> 02:12:00.480]  posted a Facebook page post last night my mayor and city managers say stating
[02:12:00.480 --> 02:12:06.040]  that they are entertaining the idea of denying citizens utilities if their
[02:12:06.040 --> 02:12:09.760]  children cause any kind of vandalism the city property or public that is huge
[02:12:09.760 --> 02:12:14.760]  here actually going to come in and turn off your utilities did you show tip that
[02:12:14.760 --> 02:12:18.760]  did you send that to show tips at info wars dot com no it's both it's posted on
[02:12:18.760 --> 02:12:22.840]  my website conspiracy news dot com it's also on my Facebook page that's huge
[02:12:22.840 --> 02:12:26.000]  let me just stop you for a minute Rick as you call in with some good tips when
[02:12:26.000 --> 02:12:30.520]  you get in so I appreciate it the reason we do first-time callers is just so we
[02:12:30.520 --> 02:12:34.960]  get new people who try to get in a chance to come on right but but but
[02:12:34.960 --> 02:12:38.720]  expanding on that for those that don't know I meant to do a whole show on this
[02:12:38.720 --> 02:12:43.320]  today but right out of time government worldwide is now going past law
[02:12:43.320 --> 02:12:48.080]  Obama's an example of that and just saying you don't take vaccines we won't
[02:12:48.080 --> 02:12:51.440]  let you have a job or travel you don't take vaccines you won't get your tax
[02:12:51.440 --> 02:12:57.320]  exemption for each kid $15,000 a year in Australia equivalent you don't do what
[02:12:57.320 --> 02:13:01.720]  we say we're going to turn your power off we claim your kid did something no
[02:13:01.720 --> 02:13:05.280]  judge no jury we'll turn your utilities off yes they're going to use the fact
[02:13:05.280 --> 02:13:10.360]  that we're domesticated in these control grids to really start jacking with us
[02:13:10.360 --> 02:13:15.000]  and it's a revolution by government to engage in criminal activity in such a
[02:13:15.000 --> 02:13:20.360]  mass scale that by force to sure it becomes the common practice through what
[02:13:20.360 --> 02:13:25.560]  is known in common law as a taking go ahead well actually admitted that on
[02:13:25.560 --> 02:13:29.760]  their local interview on the local TV station WCIA out of Champaign Illinois
[02:13:29.760 --> 02:13:35.880]  is it really called WCIA yes it's called WCIA is out of Champaign Illinois it's
[02:13:35.880 --> 02:13:39.600]  the local television station but the city manager the mayor basically admitted
[02:13:39.600 --> 02:13:44.320]  in the interview and dialogue interview that juvenile court system here doesn't
[02:13:44.320 --> 02:13:47.040]  have any teeth they don't have enough teeth to make anything stick on these
[02:13:47.040 --> 02:13:51.600]  kids so instead of going through the proper court proceedings and charging
[02:13:51.600 --> 02:13:54.840]  people and getting restitution for damages or anything like that that they
[02:13:54.840 --> 02:13:58.560]  are considering entertaining the option of turning off the utilities and it's
[02:13:58.560 --> 02:14:02.880]  going and that'll sound good to turn the utilities off to some you know family
[02:14:02.880 --> 02:14:05.280]  lists their kids be bad but now they won't be playing video games in there
[02:14:05.280 --> 02:14:09.280]  all day they'll be out robbing more and again it's not in line with
[02:14:09.280 --> 02:14:12.920]  legislation we will look that up we'll do a story and link to yours good job
[02:14:12.920 --> 02:14:18.120]  Rick from Illinois over at the top we got dr. Glidden coming up in just a
[02:14:18.120 --> 02:14:21.400]  moment I got to move quick here but I promise I get to you guys Mario in
[02:14:21.400 --> 02:14:27.400]  California you're on the year yeah hi hey Alex been a long time listener first
[02:14:27.400 --> 02:14:32.680]  time college I was calling about the drought in California here the other
[02:14:32.680 --> 02:14:37.520]  day I was watching the news and the they were saying the the water district just
[02:14:37.520 --> 02:14:41.840]  passed a new law putting new restrictions on all water use to do the
[02:14:41.840 --> 02:14:45.400]  round certain LA city yep they're not letting you build new plants they're
[02:14:45.400 --> 02:14:49.280]  not letting anybody build new for 30 40 years new reservoirs they're just going
[02:14:49.280 --> 02:14:52.600]  to jack up prices on you and they're training you to accept that right now
[02:14:52.600 --> 02:14:57.640]  yeah so I was going to ask how can we expose like how do you show that it's
[02:14:57.640 --> 02:15:01.560]  an artificial you tie it into the artificial scarcity thing ran 15 years
[02:15:01.560 --> 02:15:05.040]  ago in California by Enron where they got caught turning the power off and
[02:15:05.040 --> 02:15:08.320]  jacking up prices claiming there was artificial scarcity when there wasn't
[02:15:08.320 --> 02:15:11.960]  you explained that they didn't let the infrastructure ever develop for what was
[02:15:11.960 --> 02:15:16.320]  needed to now hold you hostage and double and triple charge you and that select
[02:15:16.320 --> 02:15:20.760]  corporations like Nesty get the water for free that's how you do it got a jump
[02:15:20.760 --> 02:15:25.320]  Mario great question God bless you now I'll get to the other callers as they
[02:15:25.320 --> 02:15:28.160]  haven't been holding as long after we've been talking to Peter Glidden for a
[02:15:28.160 --> 02:15:33.960]  while Dr. Glidden is a very busy fellow with his private practice in the books
[02:15:33.960 --> 02:15:37.880]  he's written all the work he does he's received his degree from the University
[02:15:37.880 --> 02:15:41.160]  of Massachusetts in Amherst and Indy from Barrister University in Seattle

[02:16:04.880 --> 02:16:10.120]  about vaccines first then I wanted to ask him this is really an expert on if we
[02:16:10.120 --> 02:16:13.000]  have the best medical system in the world why are illnesses such as heart
[02:16:13.000 --> 02:16:17.320]  disease arthritis diabetes type 2 high blood pressure and obesity autism
[02:16:17.320 --> 02:16:21.040]  heartburn and cancer getting worse instead of better how is 21st century
[02:16:21.040 --> 02:16:25.040]  American medical system similar to 9-11 what is the real problem with Obamacare
[02:16:25.040 --> 02:16:28.120]  how are naturopathic physicians different from MDs we're gonna get some
[02:16:28.120 --> 02:16:32.680]  concrete examples about naturopathic treat heartburn arthritis all this and
[02:16:32.680 --> 02:16:38.040]  more all I know is is it people like chiropractors are in the same
[02:16:38.040 --> 02:16:42.400]  constellation of groups that were around along with MD medicine the MD
[02:16:42.400 --> 02:16:46.560]  medicine is trying to phase out MD medicine wanted to do surgery on my
[02:16:46.560 --> 02:16:50.480]  back when I shot a 50 cal handheld over a hundred times and forever did reason
[02:16:50.480 --> 02:16:55.400]  that day through my back out my spine bent to the left like three inches look
[02:16:55.400 --> 02:17:01.240]  like a basically a bow on the x-ray I went to a chiropractor it was painful
[02:17:01.240 --> 02:17:06.400]  took three sessions they popped it 98% back and now it's totally back and the
[02:17:06.400 --> 02:17:09.840]  pain all left within two weeks miraculous they would shut that down if
[02:17:09.840 --> 02:17:15.240]  they could so that's just an example dr. Glidden thank you so much for joining
[02:17:15.240 --> 02:17:17.520]  us I want to just spend the few minutes we have here before the break on
[02:17:17.520 --> 02:17:21.800]  vaccines and medical tyranny it's here the bill is past the committee they
[02:17:21.800 --> 02:17:24.480]  have the votes in the House and Senate they say they say to be on the
[02:17:24.480 --> 02:17:29.080]  governor's desk in a month forced inoculation Australia's taking away
[02:17:29.080 --> 02:17:34.680]  the tax write-offs worth $15,000 for a family of four if you don't take the
[02:17:34.680 --> 02:17:38.960]  vaccines I mean this is really a scary time let's think about that government
[02:17:38.960 --> 02:17:44.520]  forcing us to put in us vaccines on record on the inserts that can kill us
[02:17:44.520 --> 02:17:48.680]  dr. Glidden your take on this I mean we've got a rebel now and the question is
[02:17:48.680 --> 02:17:53.520]  how well you know it's a good time for civil disobedience just saying no it's
[02:17:53.520 --> 02:17:58.800]  the same thing as Obamacare forcing people to gain access to pay monthly
[02:17:58.800 --> 02:18:03.640]  checks for medical insurance to give them access to MD directed medicine it
[02:18:03.640 --> 02:18:06.920]  doesn't give them access to chiropractors nature paths homey a pass
[02:18:06.920 --> 02:18:12.400]  I evaded practitioners it's a one-trick pony and this is just another arm of the
[02:18:12.400 --> 02:18:20.560]  octopus my advice just say no the vaccine science is fuzzy science at best if
[02:18:20.560 --> 02:18:26.560]  you look at the vaccine research objectively scientifically from an
[02:18:26.560 --> 02:18:33.280]  unbiased an unbiased unprejudiced point of view then you would not be a fan nor
[02:18:33.280 --> 02:18:39.360]  an advocate of vaccines you know drugs are like guns it's not the drug it's
[02:18:39.360 --> 02:18:44.960]  how it's used thank God for Novocaine thank God for morphine thank God for
[02:18:44.960 --> 02:18:49.640]  the sterile technique but for goodness sake vaccines well you know if they
[02:18:49.640 --> 02:18:55.920]  work that would be one thing quite frankly they do not and God only knows
[02:18:55.920 --> 02:19:03.120]  what they're putting in them my advice just say no this is in fact the tip of
[02:19:03.120 --> 02:19:06.800]  the iceberg that's right they're coming in and taking the velvet glove off the
[02:19:06.800 --> 02:19:11.480]  iron fist because in the higher educated areas upwards of 70% of people in
[02:19:11.480 --> 02:19:14.920]  areas in northern California and other areas the higher educated the less
[02:19:14.920 --> 02:19:19.600]  vaccines people aren't taking it many other areas about 30% of the country
[02:19:19.600 --> 02:19:23.720]  aren't taking them with children higher with adults it's panicking the system so
[02:19:23.720 --> 02:19:27.480]  now they're coming in and saying we're gonna force you to do it simply amazing
[02:19:27.480 --> 02:19:32.480]  well one of the reasons is follow the money right I mean the pharmaceutical
[02:19:32.480 --> 02:19:36.600]  industry is in cahoots with the federal government the federal government has
[02:19:36.600 --> 02:19:42.520]  contracts you know died in the wall you have to make so many vaccines a year
[02:19:42.520 --> 02:19:46.920]  we're gonna prepay you for them and so they already have the vaccine now they
[02:19:46.920 --> 02:19:50.880]  have to get rid of them they have to get some of their money back so there's an
[02:19:50.880 --> 02:19:54.920]  economic factor that's it well well my kids aren't taking vaccines and either
[02:19:54.920 --> 02:19:58.400]  of mine that's right dr. Glidden stay there we'll be back to break down key

[02:23:59.640 --> 02:24:09.880]  medical doctors on average individually are great people I have a surgery on my
[02:24:09.880 --> 02:24:16.680]  leg that didn't go too well when I was 16 I had a hernia surgery hard to believe
[02:24:16.680 --> 02:24:20.880]  just a week and a half ago it went superlative but that was something that
[02:24:20.880 --> 02:24:25.840]  medically had to be fixed it came out a few years ago that the federal government
[02:24:25.840 --> 02:24:30.560]  with MD medicine tried to shut down chiropractors everybody I know uses
[02:24:30.560 --> 02:24:36.640]  chiropractors rich people poor people it works great the Queen of England uses
[02:24:36.640 --> 02:24:42.200]  naturopaths so the point is you deserve the choice and what Dr. Glidden just hit
[02:24:42.200 --> 02:24:47.320]  under Obamacare it doesn't force 37 million people extra to go out and get
[02:24:47.320 --> 02:24:53.720]  insurance that covers everything no only MD medicine and drugs and now drugs are
[02:24:53.720 --> 02:24:56.960]  planting MD medicine and more and more of what they're allowed to do is give
[02:24:56.960 --> 02:25:02.520]  drugs like at the VA not even the surgeries Dr. Glidden I want to give
[02:25:02.520 --> 02:25:06.920]  you the floor in this short segment in the next long segment coming up after
[02:25:06.920 --> 02:25:12.280]  all the years of lecturing hundreds of thousands of you know people in tens of
[02:25:12.280 --> 02:25:18.920]  thousands of hours I want you to talk about the key intel that you've developed
[02:25:18.920 --> 02:25:22.280]  that really gets people to wake up if we have the best medical system in the
[02:25:22.280 --> 02:25:25.040]  world why are illnesses such as heart disease arthritis and type of diabetes
[02:25:25.040 --> 02:25:28.560]  high blood pressure and other things exploding what's really going on Dr.
[02:25:28.560 --> 02:25:32.200]  Glidden how do we reverse it well here's the deal you know the best place to
[02:25:32.200 --> 02:25:36.800]  hide something is in plain sight I mean look at 9-11 right it's a control the
[02:25:36.800 --> 02:25:42.320]  demolition right in front of everybody's face and nobody sees it for what it is we
[02:25:42.320 --> 02:25:45.720]  don't have a free medical market in the United States we haven't had a free
[02:25:45.720 --> 02:25:50.840]  medical market since the early 1920s after something called the Flexner report
[02:25:50.840 --> 02:25:57.120]  that was when the MD profession rose to ascendancy and listen your medical
[02:25:57.120 --> 02:26:01.960]  doctor might be the nicest person that God ever created but your medical
[02:26:01.960 --> 02:26:06.760]  doctor bless their hearts does not know what's best for you they only know what
[02:26:06.760 --> 02:26:11.040]  they've been trained in and what they've been trained in is one small piece of the
[02:26:11.040 --> 02:26:16.400]  pie of medical science medical doctors don't practice medicine nobody
[02:26:16.400 --> 02:26:22.240]  practices medicine medicine is a vast domain there's chiropractic medicine
[02:26:22.240 --> 02:26:27.760]  naturopathic medicine ayurvedic medicine homeopathic medicine on and on and
[02:26:27.760 --> 02:26:33.760]  on the type of medicine the philosophy of healing the philosophy of medical
[02:26:33.760 --> 02:26:39.320]  treatment that your MD is trained in is referred to as aloe pathic medicine
[02:26:39.320 --> 02:26:46.160]  right I practice naturopathic medicine MD's practice aloe pathic medicine
[02:26:46.160 --> 02:26:52.040]  aloe pathic medicine is most spectacularly fantastic for surgery when
[02:26:52.040 --> 02:26:57.600]  it's necessary for a handful of infectious diseases and for trauma but
[02:26:57.600 --> 02:27:02.000]  that's the long and the short of it for most of the conditions that most people
[02:27:02.000 --> 02:27:08.200]  go to the doctor for most of the time aloe pathic MD directed medicine does
[02:27:08.200 --> 02:27:14.160]  not work well they wanted to shut my back open when when most back surgeries we
[02:27:14.160 --> 02:27:17.680]  know fail and all I needed to do was have my spine line back up and now it's
[02:27:17.680 --> 02:27:21.680]  fine yeah that's right and do you when the back surgery fails do you get a
[02:27:21.680 --> 02:27:27.120]  refund no because it's also it's a self-policing industry and you know that
[02:27:27.120 --> 02:27:31.680]  get this right remember the best place to hide something in plain sight the
[02:27:31.680 --> 02:27:35.880]  leading cause of death in the United States MD directed medical treatments
[02:27:35.880 --> 02:27:40.680]  the leading cause of bankruptcy in the United States MD directed medical
[02:27:40.680 --> 02:27:45.320]  treatments and this is what happens when an industry becomes monopolized right
[02:27:45.320 --> 02:27:50.720]  it's good to be the king when you're the king what you say goes no matter what so
[02:27:50.720 --> 02:27:56.120]  even though while the MD's have been driving the bus of medicine arthritis is
[02:27:56.120 --> 02:28:02.680]  going up type 2 diabetes is escalating obesity in the childhood population
[02:28:02.680 --> 02:28:07.400]  obesity in the United States has risen to one third of the childhood
[02:28:07.400 --> 02:28:11.680]  population in the last 20 years with in five years they're saying you're gonna
[02:28:11.680 --> 02:28:17.120]  have diabetes it's crazy type 2 it's all chronic diseases across the board are
[02:28:17.120 --> 02:28:22.320]  on the rise and out of control and the reason for this is because the MDs are
[02:28:22.320 --> 02:28:27.440]  the wrong dog for this hunt look we wouldn't we don't go to chiropractors for
[02:28:27.440 --> 02:28:32.080]  open-heart surgery right if you you know have a bullet in your arm heaven
[02:28:32.080 --> 02:28:35.680]  forbid you're not gonna go to the chiropractor because that's not their
[02:28:35.680 --> 02:28:39.440]  thing they're not trained in it you go to the person that's trained in that well
[02:28:39.440 --> 02:28:45.480]  if it were a perfect world it would be illegal for MDs to treat chronic
[02:28:45.480 --> 02:28:49.720]  disease look at how they're even in war look at how they're even in a war now
[02:28:49.720 --> 02:28:53.920]  against nutritionist they the FDA and it doesn't even want them to be able to
[02:28:53.920 --> 02:28:56.920]  tell people that eating vitamin C can help you they want to shut everything
[02:28:56.920 --> 02:29:02.920]  down where they take over society it's a big bad voodoo daddy Alex we can talk
[02:29:02.920 --> 02:29:07.600]  about that in the next segment if most people had any idea of the control that
[02:29:07.600 --> 02:29:11.960]  the FDA and the FTC have over the delivery of nutritional supplements in
[02:29:11.960 --> 02:29:15.600]  this country there would in fact be a revolution we're going to break in a

[02:33:47.040 --> 02:33:55.040]  and then I start interrupting because it starts coming to me I'm like wait a minute they're trying to shut down nutritionists now too
[02:33:55.040 --> 02:34:01.040]  and they just want to run everything and I've got to pay all my money into government run healthcare and they want to forcibly
[02:34:01.040 --> 02:34:09.040]  inoculate me I mean these people are tyrants and I think about the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany and how
[02:34:09.040 --> 02:34:17.040]  under mouse China how they use medical tyranny for the state because it has so much authority
[02:34:17.040 --> 02:34:23.040]  but I'm going to try to shut up here and get Dr. Glitton to really break down this medical system
[02:34:23.040 --> 02:34:29.040]  and how much control the FDA and FTC have over delivery of vitamins and nutritional supplements they're moving right now
[02:34:29.040 --> 02:34:37.040]  with the states try to just ban them and they're trying to lower how much vitamins and minerals you need
[02:34:37.040 --> 02:34:43.040]  and they're trying to say you know you don't need any fat well your brain will die if you don't need fat
[02:34:43.040 --> 02:34:49.040]  they confuse it with trans fats notice the Michelle Obama school lunches it's all how many calories you get
[02:34:49.040 --> 02:34:57.040]  not that it's GMO are full of all these additives I mean I eat additives now folks I get sick
[02:34:57.040 --> 02:35:03.040]  I remember growing up I eat Doritos or something so hard I want to go lay down I didn't know about Florida I drink Florida water
[02:35:03.040 --> 02:35:09.040]  I drink headache then they have the media attacking that saying you know for sure by the drink fluoride
[02:35:09.040 --> 02:35:17.040]  when they admittedly say it is your brain so we need to fight for true medical freedom and supplement
[02:35:17.040 --> 02:35:23.040]  freedom in this country that's also one of the ways we fund our operation self fund is I go out and research
[02:35:23.040 --> 02:35:27.040]  one of the best supplements well you have a super high quality they have over 400 products but around 17 years
[02:35:27.040 --> 02:35:37.040]  they have a business system where you can sign up for 10 bucks and get 30% off the retail and get free shipping
[02:35:37.040 --> 02:35:43.040]  when you sign up for auto ship at info wars health dot com so it's a win-win-win sell at your store
[02:35:43.040 --> 02:35:49.040]  sell at your friends and family and then a lot of people are very successful at it most folks just end up being able to
[02:35:49.040 --> 02:35:58.040]  make enough to you know pay for their key essentials and that gets demonized but then I talk to veterinarians
[02:35:58.040 --> 02:36:04.040]  and they know it's all about giving the 90 essentials to cows and horses and pigs to make them healthy
[02:36:04.040 --> 02:36:09.040]  and they don't want to give vaccines to their dogs and cats and pigs because they know it ends up killing them
[02:36:09.040 --> 02:36:16.040]  I've worked for a large animal vet and a small animal vet I worked for a large animal vet a whole year full time
[02:36:16.040 --> 02:36:26.040]  and I saw it all and it's just it's so frustrating it's key folks that you experience God's creations for yourself
[02:36:26.040 --> 02:36:31.040]  things like child ease the new product we've just come out with it's from one of the leading manufacturers
[02:36:31.040 --> 02:36:36.040]  of organic supplements in the country we probably labeled it but added a few things to it it's just got basic things in it
[02:36:36.040 --> 02:36:47.040]  like chamomile flour and hawthorn berry and catnip and lemon balm and so many other key things that are just natural
[02:36:47.040 --> 02:36:57.040]  clove fruit it's inexpensive try it for yourself see what it does to your children see what it does to you when you take it

[02:38:43.040 --> 02:38:48.040]  okay drglitten I'm gonna shut up and try to have you go through your if we have the best medical system in the world
[02:38:48.040 --> 02:38:54.040]  why is cancer diabetes arthritis obesity autism everything skyrocketing it's not just over diagnosis
[02:38:54.040 --> 02:38:59.040]  we know it's happening in our own families until we get off the GMO get the proper nutrients
[02:38:59.040 --> 02:39:03.040]  but the medical doctors won't tell us that so continue with your breakdown
[02:39:03.040 --> 02:39:07.040]  well it's because they're not trained in it I mean you know you don't know what you don't know and
[02:39:07.040 --> 02:39:12.040]  chiropractors aren't trained in open heart surgery they don't know about that so they shouldn't be giving any
[02:39:12.040 --> 02:39:17.040]  advice about it one of the greatest ironies here is that when it comes to chronic disease
[02:39:17.040 --> 02:39:22.040]  the research has been done the clinical experience has been done the results are in
[02:39:22.040 --> 02:39:29.040]  all chronic diseases are related directly to nutrient deficiencies period if you have arthritis
[02:39:29.040 --> 02:39:35.040]  it's not because you have the arthritis gene it's not because you have a voodoo curse it's because your body
[02:39:35.040 --> 02:39:40.040]  has run out of the nutrients that it needs to keep your joints healthy you have type 2 diabetes
[02:39:40.040 --> 02:39:45.040]  it's because your body has run out of the minerals necessary to metabolize sugar
[02:39:45.040 --> 02:39:52.040]  the way that God in nature intended it if you have heartburn it's not because of an over production of
[02:39:52.040 --> 02:39:57.040]  stomach acid it's because of an under production of stomach acid what makes your stomach produce
[02:39:57.040 --> 02:40:03.040]  not enough acid because your calcium deficient and salt deficient we are deficient in
[02:40:03.040 --> 02:40:08.040]  essential nutrients is that why whole milk seems to be the best thing to kill heartburn for me
[02:40:08.040 --> 02:40:15.040]  well that's because you're getting milk that is extracted from cows who are feeding on
[02:40:15.040 --> 02:40:23.040]  grass that's grown in soil that has calcium in it calcium you know a cow's body cannot make calcium
[02:40:23.040 --> 02:40:28.040]  and a plant's body cannot make calcium or any of the other minerals the only way that
[02:40:28.040 --> 02:40:34.040]  minerals get into the food supply is through the soil but because of agricultural farming
[02:40:34.040 --> 02:40:40.040]  you know the industrial farming the pesticides that they use kill the bacteria in the soil
[02:40:40.040 --> 02:40:47.040]  that help the plant to extract the minerals from the soil the greatest irony here Alex I got to tell
[02:40:47.040 --> 02:40:52.040]  you man I've been doing this for 25 years clinically I've been a licensed naturopathic physician
[02:40:52.040 --> 02:40:59.040]  for 22 years I've been in the front lines of private practice and the delivery of naturopathic
[02:40:59.040 --> 02:41:04.040]  medical therapeutics for quarter of a century and I'm here to tell you that most chronic
[02:41:04.040 --> 02:41:10.040]  disease conditions will yield to the proper nutrition and it's not that difficult I mean
[02:41:10.040 --> 02:41:16.040]  we've been socialized to believe oh my god I have to go and visit the doctor I have to do
[02:41:16.040 --> 02:41:22.040]  my copay I have to sit at the feet of the almighty white coat so that they can figure things out
[02:41:22.040 --> 02:41:27.040]  well it's important to have a good diagnosis so that you know you know you're not going to die
[02:41:27.040 --> 02:41:33.040]  tomorrow and it's not a tumor pressing on your brain that's causing your symptoms but for most
[02:41:33.040 --> 02:41:39.040]  people once they know what the problem is there's a nutritional solution that's science-based
[02:41:39.040 --> 02:41:46.040]  and clinically verified it's right here today right now so what can people do well you know we
[02:41:46.040 --> 02:41:52.040]  need to be socially active we need to get involved we need to you know knock down the politicians
[02:41:52.040 --> 02:41:58.040]  who are forwarding these ridiculous pieces of legislation but in the meantime you can take
[02:41:58.040 --> 02:42:06.040]  your own health back right now with simple stuff simple solutions and you know I've been doing
[02:42:06.040 --> 02:42:12.040]  this for such a long time I've had a very frustrating supplement companies people don't you know
[02:42:12.040 --> 02:42:17.040]  you can only get as a licensed physician I'm here to tell you that Dr. Wallach's nutritional
[02:42:17.040 --> 02:42:23.040]  the products Dr. Wallach's health recovery strategies produce the most remarkable consistent
[02:42:23.040 --> 02:42:31.040]  and effective health resolutions of anything that I've ever seen it's simple it's easy it's right
[02:42:31.040 --> 02:42:38.040]  at your fingertips folks you need the 90 essential nutrients and a little bit of education absolutely
[02:42:38.040 --> 02:42:45.040]  and look I go back to the chiropractic situation I only promote what I really believe in my back
[02:42:45.040 --> 02:42:50.040]  they were saying was gonna have to have surgery they were claiming that the disc weren't herniated
[02:42:50.040 --> 02:42:56.040]  but were no no they were they weren't fully herniated but they were bulging they were all bulging out
[02:42:56.040 --> 02:43:01.040]  on one side as it swung out towards the left then I'd have to have surgery no way my back was
[02:43:01.040 --> 02:43:07.040]  gonna fail completely in a few weeks I find out who supposedly from reviews the best chiropractor
[02:43:07.040 --> 02:43:13.040]  is it's like three miles away I go over there it's a woman fifty something years old and
[02:43:13.040 --> 02:43:17.040]  over thirty years she starts jumping up on top of everything x-rays the back moves back
[02:43:17.040 --> 02:43:22.040]  half the way I'm in already a little bit less pain they hook electricity up to my back
[02:43:22.040 --> 02:43:27.040]  and it does all this scanning to loosen the muscles so they'll unhook from being strained
[02:43:27.040 --> 02:43:31.040]  and pulling my back the wrong way I come back two days later come back again the next week
[02:43:31.040 --> 02:43:36.040]  and all the pain was gone and the back went back ninety eight percent still a little bit crooked
[02:43:36.040 --> 02:43:42.040]  I kept going back that was fixed I mean I'm it's just miraculous and I'm not selling stock
[02:43:42.040 --> 02:43:47.040]  and chiropractor companies I'm saying I know that works and people like James Randy say
[02:43:47.040 --> 02:43:52.040]  it's a fraud and isn't real well bull crap I mean they just popped my back back instead
[02:43:52.040 --> 02:43:57.040]  of having to have surgery you know and I'm sick of this attitude of connecting some fake
[02:43:57.040 --> 02:44:03.040]  preacher you know who says he's healing people with a radio transmitter in his ear to people
[02:44:03.040 --> 02:44:08.040]  saying hey you have lesions on your arms you don't ever get fresh vegetables do you there's
[02:44:08.040 --> 02:44:13.040]  no vitamin K in your blood and then you start eating the vegetables and the scurvy goes away
[02:44:13.040 --> 02:44:18.040]  I mean I know so many old people who have scurvy and you know my dad would see patients
[02:44:18.040 --> 02:44:22.040]  you know he's a dentist or a surgeon he'd say you know you have bloody lesions on your arms
[02:44:22.040 --> 02:44:27.040]  are you eating any you know green vegetables well no not really well you need to I mean
[02:44:27.040 --> 02:44:32.040]  it's just crazy that scurvy's made a comeback but they won't even call it scurvy my dad
[02:44:32.040 --> 02:44:37.040]  he's retired now so many people with their teeth falling out because they just weren't
[02:44:37.040 --> 02:44:42.040]  even eating any vegetables or have they written a little bit of them they're so depleted they
[02:44:42.040 --> 02:44:47.040]  weren't getting it I mean here's what happened I was in incredible shape but ate like a pig
[02:44:47.040 --> 02:44:51.040]  when I was like twenty twenty one twenty two running six miles every other day lifting weights
[02:44:51.040 --> 02:44:55.040]  I mean bench press three hundred and forty pounds three and fifty pounds squat six hundred
[02:44:55.040 --> 02:44:59.040]  I mean I was addicted to working out that's why I did it it wasn't even a narcissistic thing
[02:44:59.040 --> 02:45:03.040]  I started working out with these UT football players I was already in shape before that
[02:45:03.040 --> 02:45:07.040]  just went into crazy shape got addicted to working out two hours a day
[02:45:07.040 --> 02:45:13.040]  but I was going with them to all you could eat Chinese and Mexican food and you know
[02:45:13.040 --> 02:45:19.040]  cafeteria all you can eat well then I start doing radio and TV I quit doing that keep
[02:45:19.040 --> 02:45:23.040]  eating like that and gain ninety eight or nine nine pounds I don't know about a hundred
[02:45:23.040 --> 02:45:29.040]  eighty three to about two hundred and seventy nine so ninety seven pounds ninety eight
[02:45:29.040 --> 02:45:35.040]  pounds then I start jogging working out now I'm fat hurts my knees this is about five years ago
[02:45:35.040 --> 02:45:39.040]  start swimming two miles every other day lose some weight but now I finally get on the
[02:45:39.040 --> 02:45:45.040]  m4worshealth.com longevity beyond taking tangerine and the rest of the alex pack products
[02:45:45.040 --> 02:45:50.040]  and I wasn't even taking it every day suddenly with the same amount of working out I lost
[02:45:50.040 --> 02:45:55.040]  thirty five forty pounds then I was told hey this type of iodine hey once you try to
[02:45:55.040 --> 02:46:00.040]  boost your testosterone naturally supermail vitality oxy powder flush your intestines out
[02:46:00.040 --> 02:46:07.040]  with Dr. Group that together another I don't know I mean I've lost almost seventy pounds
[02:46:07.040 --> 02:46:11.040]  and I've gained almost a hundred so another twenty five thirty pounds to go the point is
[02:46:11.040 --> 02:46:15.040]  is that just in forty five days a month ago a month and a half ago I lost another six
[02:46:15.040 --> 02:46:20.040]  pounds and gained muscle I mean this is real this is real I mean if you don't get
[02:46:20.040 --> 02:46:24.040]  vitamin C you die if you don't get vitamin B12 you die if you don't get vitamin D3
[02:46:24.040 --> 02:46:29.040]  you die and they're trying to lower via the UN Codex Alimentarius with corporations as
[02:46:29.040 --> 02:46:34.040]  you know Dr. Glendon down to vitamin C and things that aren't even really survivable
[02:46:34.040 --> 02:46:40.040]  a lot of experts believe what's behind that Dr. Glendon money money money money and money
[02:46:40.040 --> 02:46:47.040]  the medical profession doesn't get rich by keep by healing things they get rich by keeping
[02:46:47.040 --> 02:46:52.040]  people sick and this is I think one of the biggest disconnects that we have not been
[02:46:52.040 --> 02:46:57.040]  educated on in the school system and it's not just in the United States it's all around
[02:46:57.040 --> 02:47:03.040]  the world again your medical doctor does not practice medicine they practice allopathic
[02:47:03.040 --> 02:47:10.040]  medicine and allopathic medicine believes that the human body is a biochemical bag it's
[02:47:10.040 --> 02:47:16.040]  a bag of biochemicals waiting to break there is no spiritual force inside the human body
[02:47:16.040 --> 02:47:22.040]  there is no ability of the human body to heal itself or to fix itself so the medical doctor
[02:47:22.040 --> 02:47:29.040]  is trained not to cure the condition not to cure the condition but to manage the symptoms
[02:47:29.040 --> 02:47:34.040]  I mean for goodness sake medical doctors don't even know how to cure heartburn they can
[02:47:34.040 --> 02:47:39.040]  manage it with the little purple pill but they can't cure it because you don't want to cure
[02:47:39.040 --> 02:47:44.040]  it because you then can't sell more bottles every month well and to do you think that the
[02:47:44.040 --> 02:47:50.040]  profession that doesn't even know how to cure heartburn is going to be able to cure cancer
[02:47:50.040 --> 02:47:56.040]  no this is what people don't understand we're taking the wrong dog to the hunt ladies and
[02:47:56.040 --> 02:48:03.040]  gentlemen my radio show used to be called fire your MD now not because I hate the MDs
[02:48:03.040 --> 02:48:08.040]  I love the MDs when I need the MDs when we go to the MDs for what they're good at but
[02:48:08.040 --> 02:48:13.040]  for most of the conditions that most people go to the medical doctor for most of the time
[02:48:13.040 --> 02:48:22.040]  arthritis type 2 diabetes high blood pressure obesity etc etc etc they've got nothing for
[02:48:22.040 --> 02:48:28.040]  you except symptoms suppressive expensive pharmaceutical agents the intention of which
[02:48:28.040 --> 02:48:34.040]  is not to cure the condition but simply to manage it just ask yourself this question
[02:48:34.040 --> 02:48:40.040]  how good do you feel are you healthier now than you were a year ago are you healthier
[02:48:40.040 --> 02:48:45.040]  now than you were 10 years ago no you're not and it's not because you're getting older
[02:48:45.040 --> 02:48:51.040]  it's not because you have a bad gene and it's not because of some electromagnetic Russian
[02:48:51.040 --> 02:48:57.040]  satellite it's because your body is lacking the 90 essential nutrients and you are eating
[02:48:57.040 --> 02:49:02.040]  food every day that's hurting your body well I mean I would go to big beef production
[02:49:02.040 --> 02:49:06.040]  ranches I mean where they have you know 100,000 had a cattle or whatever I mean some of the
[02:49:06.040 --> 02:49:11.040]  biggest ones in the country were in East Texas and I'd be out there with a whole bunch of
[02:49:11.040 --> 02:49:16.040]  vets and a whole bunch of their hands with huge stock yard areas running the cattle through
[02:49:16.040 --> 02:49:20.040]  and I would hear them talk about it and they'd say well the problem is that grass is getting
[02:49:20.040 --> 02:49:25.040]  red on that chemical fertilizer that's only got you know a couple of ingredients that's
[02:49:25.040 --> 02:49:28.040]  what the plant needs is those three and I'd be hearing you know guys with you know medical
[02:49:28.040 --> 02:49:35.040]  degrees and from from A&M mainly vets veterinary medicine animal husbandry talk about it they
[02:49:35.040 --> 02:49:40.040]  would be saying that's why you got to give them this special feed that has they'd say
[02:49:40.040 --> 02:49:45.040]  like 67 of the vitamins and nutrients or I like this other one with 84 and I know Wallach's
[02:49:45.040 --> 02:49:49.040]  a famous veterinarian he also has medical degree but that's where he came up with all this
[02:49:49.040 --> 02:49:53.040]  as well but when I hear Wallach I mean this is what I've been hearing from vets forever
[02:49:53.040 --> 02:49:58.040]  he just took it to another scientific level that no you really need 90 things and my dad
[02:49:58.040 --> 02:50:03.040]  before dead doctors don't lie was ever on the radio in the early 90s my dad would always
[02:50:03.040 --> 02:50:08.040]  talk about that that the trace elements aren't there to then release the different enzymes
[02:50:08.040 --> 02:50:11.040]  and help your body build the enzymes for things he called ring structures I don't know all
[02:50:11.040 --> 02:50:15.040]  the science amount of chemists like he has he also has a degree in that as part of his
[02:50:15.040 --> 02:50:21.040]  degree to then let your body metabolize and uptake it so explain that to me when we come
[02:50:21.040 --> 02:50:25.040]  back because you know they say we only need a few vitamins and minerals but why do you
[02:50:25.040 --> 02:50:31.040]  and Dr. Wallach say it's 90 and then why if it's known that cows say up in the Dakotas
[02:50:31.040 --> 02:50:34.040]  if they don't have the proper minerals they freeze the death but if they have them they
[02:50:34.040 --> 02:50:41.040]  don't freeze in the winter I mean that's why look the business of animal production is
[02:50:41.040 --> 02:50:45.040]  money making that's why they don't play games there folks they know it's all about the minerals
[02:50:45.040 --> 02:50:49.040]  because they don't want sick animals but with us it's the inverse because they want to
[02:50:49.040 --> 02:50:54.040]  sick so they can keep milk and it's like breast cancer you'll never hear let's find the cause
[02:50:54.040 --> 02:51:01.040]  it's let's find the treatment let's find the cure.

[02:54:09.040 --> 02:54:13.040]  yes we do some of the funding of this major media operation every few weeks to an interview
[02:54:13.040 --> 02:54:18.040]  with somebody who's promoting products that we sell and promote but these are products
[02:54:18.040 --> 02:54:23.040]  that I got talked into taking about five years ago and I wish I'd done it earlier because
[02:54:23.040 --> 02:54:27.040]  as soon as I had all this even though I was eating pretty organic and healthy that stuff
[02:54:27.040 --> 02:54:34.040]  still a lot of it from debilitated soils it just supercharged my life and it's done that
[02:54:34.040 --> 02:54:42.040]  for so many friends and family info wars health.com info wars life.com is my group of products

[02:55:05.040 --> 02:55:11.040]  up there and get his health alerts and get his Dr. Glitten.com insider there on the site
[02:55:11.040 --> 02:55:17.040]  as well okay Dr. Glitten finish up with your breakdown here because it's not just like they're
[02:55:17.040 --> 02:55:21.040]  already doing all this bad now they're in a major offensive to totally take over is that
[02:55:21.040 --> 02:55:25.040]  because as I've said part of it at least is that there is a huge awakening we see that
[02:55:25.040 --> 02:55:30.040]  happening with labeling and people waking up to GMO people waking up to what true organic
[02:55:30.040 --> 02:55:35.040]  vitamins can do is it because there's that wake up happening and they're trying to counter
[02:55:35.040 --> 02:55:40.040]  offensive or are they trying to sew things up they've always been trying to sew things
[02:55:40.040 --> 02:55:44.040]  up they've always been trying to monopolize the medical marketplace and that's really
[02:55:44.040 --> 02:55:50.040]  been a train that's moving down the track since the early 1920s this is just another iteration
[02:55:50.040 --> 02:55:56.040]  and most people in America most people all around the world they just don't have any
[02:55:56.040 --> 02:56:01.040]  education they don't have any perspective on this and because everybody is sick all of
[02:56:01.040 --> 02:56:06.040]  the time all around the world people look around and they just assume that that's the way that
[02:56:06.040 --> 02:56:11.040]  it is oh you know life that that's just life you have to be sick the older that you get
[02:56:11.040 --> 02:56:16.040]  the worse your health is and that's not the truth the only reason that we get sick with
[02:56:16.040 --> 02:56:21.040]  a chronic disease is because we're eating all the wrong food all the time and our body
[02:56:21.040 --> 02:56:27.040]  is devoid of the 90 essential nutrients it's that simple all it takes really is a little
[02:56:27.040 --> 02:56:33.040]  bit of education here if you're smart enough to pass the driver's license test folks you're
[02:56:33.040 --> 02:56:38.040]  smart enough to know what to do to support your body let's just take bodybuilders fix
[02:56:38.040 --> 02:56:41.040]  itself let's take bodybuilders and they got the natural ones and the unnatural ones but
[02:56:41.040 --> 02:56:45.040]  all of them will tell you it doesn't matter how many steroids you take or what you do
[02:56:45.040 --> 02:56:50.040]  and how much you work out if you don't take natural pure vitamins that's what Schwarzenegger
[02:56:50.040 --> 02:56:54.040]  said people claim the government says you only need the RDA but he said it's like saying
[02:56:54.040 --> 02:56:59.040]  you only need a hundred cops in a town but what have you had one on every corner I mean
[02:56:59.040 --> 02:57:03.040]  it's the argument of you need them there and you need the other vitamins to be able to
[02:57:03.040 --> 02:57:07.040]  metabolize the other vitamins and nutrients they've all got to be there or they don't
[02:57:07.040 --> 02:57:11.040]  get metabolized is that correct yeah and this is the this is the meat and potatoes
[02:57:11.040 --> 02:57:15.040]  of the holistic approach right and this is what naturopathic physicians are trained in
[02:57:15.040 --> 02:57:22.040]  MDs are trained in a reductionistic approach naturopathic doctors chiropractors homeopaths
[02:57:22.040 --> 02:57:27.040]  irevated practitioners are trained in a holistic approach and you know if you took your car
[02:57:27.040 --> 02:57:32.040]  in to be tuned up and all they did was put air in the tires well you know the car wouldn't
[02:57:32.040 --> 02:57:38.040]  be running so great you need to do it across the board fix well when you take all 90 essential
[02:57:38.040 --> 02:57:44.040]  nutrients into your body switches start to turn on that have been turned off for years

[02:59:51.040 --> 02:59:55.040]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[02:59:55.040 --> 03:00:07.040]  from his central Texas command center deep behind enemy lines the information war
[03:00:07.040 --> 03:00:12.040]  continues it's Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[03:00:20.040 --> 03:00:23.040]  I want to have Dr. Glidden back in the next few months to take an hour of phone
[03:00:23.040 --> 03:00:27.040]  calls and get your questions but really what he broke down really is the truth
[03:00:27.040 --> 03:00:34.040]  and is an indictment of the system and now the AMA big pharma FDA are moving in
[03:00:34.040 --> 03:00:41.040]  to try to shut down because they know under Obamacare we're not going to get
[03:00:41.040 --> 03:00:45.040]  even worse health care computerized health care big pharma health care what
[03:00:45.040 --> 03:00:48.040]  about that point I made earlier because I've talked to medical managers my dad
[03:00:48.040 --> 03:00:51.040]  managed when he retired over a hundred dental offices he also did consulting for
[03:00:51.040 --> 03:00:55.040]  major hospitals he testified in the legislature he was getting me a pretty
[03:00:55.040 --> 03:00:59.040]  big wheel and he got out because he said there's no way to follow the law
[03:00:59.040 --> 03:01:03.040]  under Obamacare it's selectively meant to shut down the dental offices and
[03:01:03.040 --> 03:01:07.040]  medical clinics that aren't part of the big boys so as MD medicine gets
[03:01:07.040 --> 03:01:12.040]  attacked in this consolidation we're going to see major resistance but I mean
[03:01:12.040 --> 03:01:17.040]  what's your take on that angle that we've got a really rebel with with our actions
[03:01:17.040 --> 03:01:24.040]  now against this because they're going for broke and again I've lost dr. Glendon's
[03:01:24.040 --> 03:01:29.040]  audio we're gonna we're gonna we're gonna work on that with dr. Glendon it
[03:01:29.040 --> 03:01:34.040]  happened earlier and I'm not sure what's going on but I'm not sure if it's on
[03:01:34.040 --> 03:01:39.040]  his end or our end but it happened earlier and I wanted to try to get him to
[03:01:39.040 --> 03:01:45.040]  answer that question but again that's what we try to do here is promote things
[03:01:45.040 --> 03:01:49.040]  that help you that help us that help everybody that we know have had good
[03:01:49.040 --> 03:01:53.040]  effects for ourselves and the system doesn't want that they they want to sell
[03:01:53.040 --> 03:01:58.040]  you a light bulb that breaks in three months instead of in 20 years and then
[03:01:58.040 --> 03:02:01.040]  they could have made the old-fashioned light bulbs last for years but they did
[03:02:01.040 --> 03:02:04.040]  because they want to keep selling you the same light bulbs we're not going with
[03:02:04.040 --> 03:02:07.040]  the planned obsolescent system we want to promote things that build humanity
[03:02:07.040 --> 03:02:14.040]  make us stronger because then humans will create new powerful dramatic
[03:02:14.040 --> 03:02:21.040]  systems whatever messed up his audio on his end or our end okay good okay I want
[03:02:21.040 --> 03:02:24.040]  to be able to say bye to him dr. Glendon go ahead and answer that question I
[03:02:24.040 --> 03:02:28.040]  mean I see them even coming after MD medicine now and making it pure
[03:02:28.040 --> 03:02:32.040]  government pure big pharma so they're gonna replace surgery now that can be
[03:02:32.040 --> 03:02:37.040]  good sometimes with drugs well it's a it's bad and it's getting worse and it's
[03:02:37.040 --> 03:02:41.040]  because you know the monopoly just rolls forward and the people are uneducated
[03:02:41.040 --> 03:02:45.040]  everybody's dumbed down because they put fluoride in the water and what are you
[03:02:45.040 --> 03:02:50.040]  gonna do you have to vote with your feet right so if there's a legislator in
[03:02:50.040 --> 03:02:54.040]  your area that says that if they get elected they're gonna strike down
[03:02:54.040 --> 03:02:58.040]  Obamacare then you have to vote for them you have to support for them you have
[03:02:58.040 --> 03:03:03.040]  to give the people in the system who are rallying against the system because
[03:03:03.040 --> 03:03:08.040]  there are people there your vote and your support and in the meantime for
[03:03:08.040 --> 03:03:13.040]  goodness sake get your own health squared away first get your own health
[03:03:13.040 --> 03:03:17.040]  squared away first it's a million times easier than you think it is
[03:03:17.040 --> 03:03:22.040]  absolutely well dr. Peter Glendon thank you so much for the time dr. Glendon
[03:03:22.040 --> 03:03:27.040]  dot com that webinar I'll try to watch that as well because even though I know
[03:03:27.040 --> 03:03:31.040]  all this it's taking me five five and a half years to slowly like turning a big
[03:03:31.040 --> 03:03:35.040]  ship around to slowly start changing direction now I've changed direction
