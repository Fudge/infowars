[00:00.000 --> 00:11.720]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does
[00:11.720 --> 00:37.880]  he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:37.880 --> 00:45.040]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are live and it is Monday, the eighth day of April 2013. We're
[00:45.040 --> 00:51.000]  going to be here live for the next three hours. There is just all sorts of insanity breaking
[00:51.000 --> 01:00.120]  out all over the world. In Egypt, in Libya, in Syria, in North Africa, Christians are
[01:00.120 --> 01:09.720]  being mass murdered and just torched and beheaded and raped and killed everywhere. Black Libyans
[01:09.720 --> 01:16.080]  are being hacked up with machetes and machine-gunned daily. And it's just back of foreign newspapers
[01:16.080 --> 01:20.280]  because the Peace Prize winner is running it all with NATO.
[01:20.280 --> 01:24.880]  I mean, I have stacks of these articles every day to the point of I don't even get to them.
[01:24.880 --> 01:29.680]  It's like, oh, Coptic Christians under siege as mob attacks Cairo Cathedral trying to burn
[01:29.680 --> 01:34.880]  it down, London Independent. Israel closes Gaza Crossing after rockets fired. Gaza, I
[01:34.880 --> 01:43.120]  mean, it just goes on and on and on until it is not even a news item anymore. It is
[01:43.120 --> 01:49.160]  just not even a news item that all of this craziness is going on.
[01:49.160 --> 01:55.120]  And it's now normal to have the Department of Defense have training manuals for the military
[01:55.120 --> 02:01.120]  that quote evangelical Christians and Catholics period are extremist and they put them in
[02:01.120 --> 02:06.400]  a category right next to Al Qaeda. And it's on Fox News, it's not even a news item. Just
[02:06.400 --> 02:10.200]  as Fox News doesn't become a national story.
[02:10.200 --> 02:16.160]  MSNBC host in a promo ad running says your kids don't belong to you, they belong to the
[02:16.160 --> 02:20.240]  state and the collective. And the only place that cares about it is DrudgeReport.com. It's
[02:20.240 --> 02:28.040]  on the left hand side of DrudgeReport.com. MSNBC host, your kids belong to the collective.
[02:28.040 --> 02:33.420]  And that's why the White House said last week, the Drudge Report is causing us problems.
[02:33.420 --> 02:39.260]  The Drudge Report is causing us problems because we can't control the narrative. I mean, what
[02:39.260 --> 02:43.600]  is there? There's M4worsh.com, there's Drudge Report, Beck covers some of this stuff, Limbaugh
[02:43.600 --> 02:47.680]  a little bit, but he won't talk about Republicans that are going along with it really.
[02:47.680 --> 02:51.800]  I mean, this country, Michael Savage talks about some of this stuff. And of course, they're
[02:51.800 --> 02:59.080]  not perfect. But I mean, at least they'll say communism's not a good idea. America has
[02:59.080 --> 03:05.080]  lost its moral rudder and compass, and so is the entire Western world for that matter.
[03:05.080 --> 03:10.440]  And now Katie barred the door. I mean, Katie barred the door. I was driving into work this
[03:10.440 --> 03:14.800]  morning, listening to local AM talk radio.
[03:14.800 --> 03:19.520]  And I heard caller after caller going, Obamacare gives me free healthcare. Obama cares about
[03:19.520 --> 03:25.720]  me. And the host would say, well, you know, it doubles healthcare prices this year. It
[03:25.720 --> 03:31.420]  hires 16,000 IRS agents. It was written by the insurance companies. It's a giant scam.
[03:31.420 --> 03:35.760]  It does have death panels, rationing of care. And the people would laugh at him going, that's
[03:35.760 --> 03:40.320]  a talking point from the Republican Party.
[03:40.320 --> 03:46.600]  Now, the Republican Party's bought and paid for at the top by the very same people. It's
[03:46.600 --> 03:58.340]  bought and paid for by the very same people at every level. And Mitt Romney with the big
[03:58.340 --> 04:05.880]  insurance companies a decade ago or more wrote what became Obamacare. I mean, heaven help
[04:05.880 --> 04:11.080]  us. It's all about rah, rah, I'm in the winning camp. I'm a Democrat and my guy's in power.
[04:11.080 --> 04:15.560]  And when Republicans in power, rah, rah, my guy's in, I'm winning. Meanwhile, foreign
[04:15.560 --> 04:24.160]  special interests are gutting this country up one side and down the other.
[04:24.160 --> 04:31.080]  That's what's going on in this nation. That's what's happening. And America has just gotten
[04:31.080 --> 04:38.440]  in a position of a bunch of TV head iPod surfing, iPad surfing, people who cannot take action
[04:38.440 --> 04:42.680]  to even save their own future. There is not an initiative in this country. A hundred and
[04:42.680 --> 04:49.580]  one million people don't work in this country of the supposed workforce. Basically, close
[04:49.580 --> 04:52.900]  to half the country doesn't work in this country.
[04:52.900 --> 04:56.720]  And they're now saying, hey, let's enslave the other group and make them serve us. We'll
[04:56.720 --> 05:00.880]  be back with all the big news.
[05:00.880 --> 05:05.580]  Now that we have moved into the winter season, there is an increased need to support our
[05:05.580 --> 05:11.200]  immunity and health. At Silver Lungs, we are committed to meeting your needs by providing
[05:11.200 --> 05:16.640]  a full selection of silver based products. Our most popular silver based products are

[06:10.160 --> 06:15.320]  are stockpiling food, gold and weapons. But how will these items help if you or one of

[08:03.200 --> 08:11.920]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[08:11.920 --> 08:28.400]  We have a full raft of guests joining us. Dr. Steve Pachinik who is on the DMZ will
[08:28.400 --> 08:32.340]  be with us for about 10 minutes at the bottom of the hour with any updates on the North
[08:32.340 --> 08:40.860]  Korea, South Korea crisis that's continuing to basically escalate. And then we've got
[08:40.860 --> 08:47.720]  Dan Bongino, the Secret Service agent on who's gone public defending the Second Amendment.
[08:47.720 --> 08:52.920]  We've got him popping in on the broadcast. We've got Mike Glenn who's obviously known
[08:52.920 --> 08:58.800]  as the Stinger, a very famous basketball player to talk about the real black history and a
[08:58.800 --> 09:02.780]  lot of really interesting things that he's written about in his books and how it ties
[09:02.780 --> 09:04.880]  into modern day things that are happening.
[09:04.880 --> 09:10.800]  He's also involved with mfowarsteam.com, mfowarshealth.com. And then I'm gonna go into overdrive today
[09:10.800 --> 09:17.200]  with Antonio Buhler, the West Point grad, no criminal record, film police grabbing on
[09:17.200 --> 09:24.520]  women. And so he simply went over to film it and they got in his face, grabbed on him
[09:24.520 --> 09:30.160]  and they've now had a grand jury indict him a year later.
[09:30.160 --> 09:34.480]  Why don't they go indict George Washington or the Bill of Rights? How about you indict
[09:34.480 --> 09:40.340]  a newborn baby and cut its spinal cord with a pair of scissors? I mean, that's what they
[09:40.340 --> 09:45.040]  do every hour in this country. Babies that are born out on the table, nine months old,
[09:45.040 --> 09:48.200]  people begging to adopt it, just kill it.
[09:48.200 --> 09:53.100]  I say indict all the babies and put them on death row. I mean, again, you got the cops
[09:53.100 --> 10:00.280]  going around with high death sunglasses, videoing us, government breaking in to our computers,
[10:00.280 --> 10:04.560]  Google breaking into our computers, all of it illegal. But they're trying to put people
[10:04.560 --> 10:08.160]  in prison for life in Illinois who film or tape the police.
[10:08.160 --> 10:15.000]  This is the upside down world. By the way, I heard that police chief Art Acevedo wants
[10:15.000 --> 10:20.080]  to come on the broadcast. Because I guess he heard me talking about how he should move
[10:20.080 --> 10:25.080]  back to Cuba, where they take the guns from the general citizens. He supposedly fled there
[10:25.080 --> 10:28.520]  as a child with his parents from the tyranny of Cuba.
[10:28.520 --> 10:35.600]  And now he says you shouldn't be able to have a 15 round mag, shut down the gun shows. And
[10:35.600 --> 10:40.320]  he said in his speech, you either go along with this or you're with the criminals. Hey,
[10:40.320 --> 10:47.640]  Art, crimes dropped 49% because of the proliferation of firearms since 1991, FBI's own numbers.
[10:47.640 --> 10:54.000]  Stop putting out the Southern Poverty Law Center, ADL, Million Mom, 13 Bureaucrat March,
[10:54.000 --> 10:57.640]  14 Bureaucrat March, I've been out to these in Austin. Stop sitting there with all your
[10:57.640 --> 10:59.240]  fake bluster.
[10:59.240 --> 11:05.360]  You bet I want you to come in here whenever you want this week, come in the studio. I
[11:05.360 --> 11:10.680]  can't wait. I can't wait, come in studio. Came up to Jucari Jackson, they were out there
[11:10.680 --> 11:16.160]  at the 15 Bureaucrat and 14 Communist March down at the Capitol demonizing the Second
[11:16.160 --> 11:19.000]  Amendment here in Austin, Texas.
[11:19.000 --> 11:24.240]  And R.J. Saaveda came over and said that he wants to come on and confront me. Well, come
[11:24.240 --> 11:30.860]  on, that'll make some good radio, I tell you. And he's a nice guy, he's like, hey, here's
[11:30.860 --> 11:35.000]  my car and I live over here by you. We ought to come over to the house and have a beer
[11:35.000 --> 11:36.000]  sometime.
[11:36.000 --> 11:39.960]  And I'm like, come over and have a beer and what, drive home? He said, no, of course not,
[11:39.960 --> 11:47.280]  wait a few hours. Anyways, I like to have a beer. It's just all anthropology, sociology
[11:47.280 --> 11:51.840]  as he's here trying to calm the natives and get us to turn in our boom sticks and go on
[11:51.840 --> 11:52.840]  the reservation.
[11:52.840 --> 12:00.120]  He's gonna pat me on the head. He's definitely a slick one, a fed if I've ever seen one.
[12:00.120 --> 12:07.140]  And so we will certainly get him in here. I'm looking forward to that. So let's call
[12:07.140 --> 12:12.800]  his office and tell him Art wants to come in here now. Bring him in, bring him in, bring
[12:12.800 --> 12:15.240]  him in.
[12:15.240 --> 12:22.160]  Speaking of Second Amendment news, Obama to bring some Sandy Hook families on Air Force
[12:22.160 --> 12:27.720]  One. He had to pimp out the dead children some more. Or to bring on people that sit
[12:27.720 --> 12:32.840]  there and look and act like actors. They're sitting there laughing while watching this.
[12:32.840 --> 12:39.480]  Two seconds later, turn your guns in. I mean, it's like, wow, man, my kids have been killed
[12:39.480 --> 12:44.060]  like this. I'd be saying, why was Adam Lanza on all these psychotropic drugs, which has
[12:44.060 --> 12:45.060]  now come out.
[12:45.060 --> 12:50.160]  And of course, it's now come out again. People said last week, it's breaking. He was on seven
[12:50.160 --> 12:57.080]  psychotropics. Holmes, the supposed Batman shooter. Remember, I saw the video saying
[12:57.080 --> 13:00.660]  I thought they'd pull false flags with triggers in the movie. And the media asked, why does
[13:00.660 --> 13:03.040]  Alex connect Batman to the last two shootings?
[13:03.040 --> 13:10.740]  I connected it before it happened. And it turned out that he was on seven drugs that
[13:10.740 --> 13:16.680]  came out early on. But finally, it was in the LA Times last week. So now, it's official,
[13:16.680 --> 13:25.840]  seven psychotropic drugs and then under government psychiatric care with a top Air Force officer.
[13:25.840 --> 13:34.400]  And he was in a DARPA program that was in computer mind interface, virtual reality mind
[13:34.400 --> 13:40.720]  control. And then his dad was involved with the big six mega banks writing key software.
[13:40.720 --> 13:47.700]  I mean, just talk about the same history Harrison Kleibold's parents in both involved with DARPA.
[13:47.700 --> 13:48.700]  Look that up.
[13:48.700 --> 13:58.720]  Man, I tell you, who knows if any of this is even real or true. By the way, Adan Salazar
[13:58.720 --> 14:04.000]  found two different people from the Batman shooting that are admitted actors. In fact,
[14:04.000 --> 14:08.040]  some of them are in pretty good sized movies that were official victims in it.
[14:08.040 --> 14:12.720]  And they're in Aurora. And I told him back at the time I said, don't do that report.
[14:12.720 --> 14:19.040]  We don't need to get off into that because the public just isn't ready for it. But I
[14:19.040 --> 14:23.920]  want him to go dig those up again. You've got the promo reels and it's not like people
[14:23.920 --> 14:25.720]  are saying, hey, this guy's an actor.
[14:25.720 --> 14:29.320]  Hey, that guy's an actor. Hey, this guy looks alike. There's a lot of schizophrenics out
[14:29.320 --> 14:33.560]  there that think I'm Bill Hicks or whatever when I'm actually a reptoid. I mean, come
[14:33.560 --> 14:42.360]  on, we all know the truth. But expanding on this, these are people that are admitted actors.
[14:42.360 --> 14:48.520]  And I don't mean just all these wannabe actors. I mean, they're really actors. And they're
[14:48.520 --> 14:54.820]  on the news going, look, I have my pay stub. Yes, I saw it all. One guy acted alone. We
[14:54.820 --> 14:56.920]  need to restrict the Second Amendment.
[14:56.920 --> 15:07.000]  And I mean, they've even had Al Qaeda out there with a cut, okay, roll, take three on
[15:07.000 --> 15:10.880]  CNN. And the Russians were able to descramble it and put it out where they're literally
[15:10.880 --> 15:16.880]  going. Okay, ready, action. Okay, as soon as I say action, start firing the guns. Okay,
[15:16.880 --> 15:23.920]  action. Are you ready CNN? Okay, okay, amateur actors, amateur CIA guys, we need an actor,
[15:23.920 --> 15:26.160]  Gary, right out of Team America.
[15:26.160 --> 15:33.920]  Hold on, okay, I'm ready to go. Yes, we are here in Syria where Assad is hurting the children.
[15:33.920 --> 15:38.540]  And as you can hear, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow. There are dead here. Yes, they are
[15:38.540 --> 15:51.280]  killing us. Help us America, help us America. I mean, we did reports on that a year ago.
[15:51.280 --> 15:56.200]  Where they've got all these fake people out there, just like the babies in the incubators
[15:56.200 --> 15:57.200]  in 1990.
[15:57.200 --> 16:02.040]  And just like all the other lies where they have the daughter of the PR firm come in there
[16:02.040 --> 16:07.560]  and say that Koresh molested them. I mean, it just goes on and on and on to the point
[16:07.560 --> 16:12.720]  of they say, okay, we're gonna burn down Dorner. Get the fire, set the fire, burn him up. I
[16:12.720 --> 16:17.260]  want that cabin burnt down. We have the fire. We have placed the fire. The fire is ignited.
[16:17.260 --> 16:22.040]  We have a fire. All right, good job team. That does not mean we burn that down. That's
[16:22.040 --> 16:24.360]  a conspiracy theory.
[16:24.360 --> 16:29.320]  That sounds like the ravings of a fascist.
[16:29.320 --> 16:38.400]  You guys have got to stop that, please. That is funny. Man, you know what sounds like the
[16:38.400 --> 16:47.440]  ravings of a fascist? Let's queue up this Colorado state rep where they're giving secret
[16:47.440 --> 16:52.560]  service the power to engage in police actions against citizens.
[16:52.560 --> 17:00.960]  That's federal police with a state bill, the state being fully federalized, SB13-013. ATF,
[17:00.960 --> 17:06.680]  of course, has got the giant spy databases they're setting up. Army says evangelicals
[17:06.680 --> 17:12.200]  and Catholics, period, are extremists and put them on a map next to Al-Qaeda. Yeah,
[17:12.200 --> 17:13.200]  there it is.
[17:13.200 --> 17:24.560]  A member of the state legislature, Diane DeGette, she says that, and we talked about this last
[17:24.560 --> 17:27.960]  week, but I mean, I just got to play this clip again. She says, hey, we've got to get
[17:27.960 --> 17:33.560]  rid of the magazines. After you use them, you can only use them once. So again, a lot
[17:33.560 --> 17:40.640]  of this is just the people that are anti-liberty are dumber than a sack of bricks.
[17:40.640 --> 17:45.840]  I mean, they are dumber than a dead possum that's been dead for five days on the side
[17:45.840 --> 17:51.180]  of the road that's got bureaucrats crawling all over it. I mean, these people are as dumb
[17:51.180 --> 17:58.400]  as the day is long. They are stupid. And that's who the globalists get to run for office.
[17:58.400 --> 18:04.000]  Just the dumbest, stupidest morons out there.
[18:04.000 --> 18:08.960]  Okay, so let's go ahead and go to this clip of her saying, we gotta ban the magazines
[18:08.960 --> 18:11.600]  because then they're no good after you use them once. Here it is.
[18:11.600 --> 18:16.880]  I do think that we can pass those. And just very briefly to your last question, what's
[18:16.880 --> 18:25.240]  the efficacy of banning these magazine clips? I will tell you, these are ammunition, they're
[18:25.240 --> 18:30.800]  bullets. So the people who have those now, they're going to shoot them. And so if you
[18:30.800 --> 18:37.880]  ban them in the future, the number of these high capacity magazines is going to decrease
[18:37.880 --> 18:42.460]  dramatically over time because the bullets will have been shot and there won't be any
[18:42.460 --> 18:47.200]  more available.
[18:47.200 --> 18:53.120]  The road to hell is paved with useful idiot morons and this woman wins the grand idiot
[18:53.120 --> 19:00.040]  award. The grand dupe, sucker, schmuck, fool, dumb ass, I have to use that term, it's the
[19:00.040 --> 19:04.540]  only way to describe it. And man, listen, they got legions of these people. I've had
[19:04.540 --> 19:08.360]  a carpet cleaner in my house, saw a gun case, and started to call the police.
[19:08.360 --> 19:14.240]  And I had to call their manager and say, stop them, stop them, they're mentally ill. I mean,
[19:14.240 --> 19:19.680]  that's America, ladies and gentlemen, dumber than a box of rocks, thinking Obama's gonna
[19:19.680 --> 19:27.000]  give them free healthcare. And you wanna talk about the ravings of a control freak authoritarian,
[19:27.000 --> 19:28.480]  the ravings of a fascist.
[19:28.480 --> 19:34.600]  The story's up on DrudgeReport.com, MSNBC host. Four kids belong to the collective, it's
[19:34.600 --> 19:38.720]  on the left-hand side of DrudgeReport.com. It's an Infowars.com story, but it scrolled
[19:38.720 --> 19:42.480]  off, it's from yesterday. I'm gonna get it posted back up on Infowars.com, where she
[19:42.480 --> 19:47.920]  says your kids belong to us, and this is an MSNBC promo video.
[19:47.920 --> 19:52.120]  They're not gonna stop, okay? They're gonna raise your taxes till you live in a 200 square
[19:52.120 --> 19:57.740]  foot coffin box with government pitos in there teaching your kids, like Jocelyn Eldridge
[19:57.740 --> 20:00.400]  said, how to masturbate. That's who these people are.

[22:31.000 --> 22:35.200]  why banks, stock workers, investment advisors want to talk about gold IRAs? They've been
[22:35.200 --> 22:40.080]  available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your
[22:40.080 --> 22:44.880]  retirement. Gold is outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs. If you would like
[22:44.880 --> 22:51.240]  to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237. Don't get left behind by rising inflation

[24:15.480 --> 24:39.720]  All right, Alex Jones here back live. Dr. Pachinik's popping in for like 10 minutes.
[24:39.720 --> 24:45.440]  From the DMZ, the latest on North Korea, we'll get into that. But here's the headline, MSNBC
[24:45.440 --> 24:50.360]  hosts, your kids belong to the collective. And there she is with this arrogant, lisping,
[24:50.360 --> 24:56.640]  crazed look in her eye. These are dominators. These are people that can't build anything.
[24:56.640 --> 25:03.480]  So they see their empires building as they take you over. These are slave masters who
[25:03.480 --> 25:09.880]  wanna be able to, like the UN has pushed and Jocelyn Elders, quote, reach down and show
[25:09.880 --> 25:15.840]  the kids how to do it. And you're like, that's outrageous. Why are they so outrageous?
[25:15.840 --> 25:21.480]  Because it's about breaking you. It's about Stockholm syndrome. It's about going for it
[25:21.480 --> 25:27.980]  all and then going for it all again and going. They're like hopping around demons. People
[25:27.980 --> 25:32.960]  that hate you having a nice family, hate your swimming pool, hate your wealth. That's all
[25:32.960 --> 25:38.280]  they talk about. Disgusting America with all its wealth and people that have things. You
[25:38.280 --> 25:43.080]  hear it. Meanwhile, they're in helicopters and jets and giant government buildings. They
[25:43.080 --> 25:44.160]  hate you.
[25:44.160 --> 25:49.020]  They have an instinct towards total domination. They have an instinct that if you gain something,
[25:49.020 --> 25:56.520]  they're losing something because they're predators. These people are total and complete predators.
[25:56.520 --> 25:59.600]  The reason I'm bringing up Jocelyn Elders is I was talking about how the state controls
[25:59.600 --> 26:02.880]  your kids. And one of the IT guys that was up here last night, he goes, remember Jocelyn
[26:02.880 --> 26:12.320]  Elders? Go and reach down and help the kindergartners. That voice, reach down and help them. I mean,
[26:12.320 --> 26:17.120]  it's just like, what? Is there no end to you people?
[26:17.120 --> 26:23.880]  And now we've got Melissa Harris-Perry engaged in total neuro-linguistic programming. People
[26:23.880 --> 26:26.280]  always asking me, do you know about this? Do you know about that? So I went and studied
[26:26.280 --> 26:32.300]  it. And it's a quack science they use that I guess only works on people that are unconscious.
[26:32.300 --> 26:37.120]  And they'll say something that they know is what people agree with. Your children belong
[26:37.120 --> 26:43.280]  to you to trigger synapses in the brain. They go, that's right, they do, they're mine. Normal
[26:43.280 --> 26:48.080]  mammalian response. But actually, we need to strengthen public education.
[26:48.080 --> 26:53.840]  We haven't supported it, which is a lie. More funding to communist education, government
[26:53.840 --> 26:57.200]  reeducation camps than the other nation in the history of the world meant to take over
[26:57.200 --> 27:02.400]  society in their own documents that Charlotte Iserby details in her book Deliberate Dumbing
[27:02.400 --> 27:05.720]  Down. So first she says something that's true to get you, then she gives you a lie.
[27:05.720 --> 27:12.040]  It's all scripted off a teleprompter, official MSNBC ad. Your kids belong to you, and they're
[27:12.040 --> 27:19.000]  your responsibility. And then, by the way, we haven't been supportive of public education.
[27:19.000 --> 27:23.660]  But now that's all over, because your kids belong to the whole community. And she sells
[27:23.660 --> 27:28.000]  it like, we're gonna take a weight off you. Let your kids stay till eight at night at
[27:28.000 --> 27:30.320]  the public school, like they're now pushing.
[27:30.320 --> 27:37.580]  Let's have over the summer, you know what, all the time, all the time, all the time,
[27:37.580 --> 27:45.920]  the whole thing is a psych warfare event with a crazed nobody that goes to Delphi Technique
[27:45.920 --> 27:50.740]  and Rand Corporation events. They're all funded by this, it's on record. You can look it up,
[27:50.740 --> 27:54.020]  all these federal bureaucrats at that level. That's a federal agent you're looking at right
[27:54.020 --> 27:55.020]  there.
[27:55.020 --> 28:00.820]  MSNBC is a globalist propaganda command base, raining down racial and cultural division
[28:00.820 --> 28:05.640]  with the government as the unifier. The Roman model of balkanize everybody, and then it
[28:05.640 --> 28:11.920]  bundles the sticks together. True fascism is the sticks bundled together, tied together.
[28:11.920 --> 28:17.600]  The fasci, that's what fascism comes from. Bulk break us into pieces so we're not strong,
[28:17.600 --> 28:23.440]  and then the state ties us together with hatchets above it. The sword, the weapon, the gun,
[28:23.440 --> 28:25.860]  you don't have a gun, the state has the gun.
[28:25.860 --> 28:30.520]  These are naked conscious authoritarians, running around with their tongues hanging
[28:30.520 --> 28:35.880]  out like wild wolves. And you're in such a trance, people are like, the government loves
[28:35.880 --> 28:41.560]  me, Obama wants to give me something free. Obama is CIA raised from birth, Ford Foundation,
[28:41.560 --> 28:46.460]  Rockefeller Foundation, literal Manchurian candidate of the New World Order to bring
[28:46.460 --> 28:50.680]  in hell and death.
[28:50.680 --> 29:00.520]  Ladies and gentlemen, he rides the white horse of pestilence and death. Now let's go ahead
[29:00.520 --> 29:04.540]  and go to this clip. We're gonna go to break and come back with it. We got time, go out
[29:04.540 --> 29:07.180]  to break with it. Here's the evil.
[29:07.180 --> 29:11.900]  We have never invested as much in public education as we should have because we've always had
[29:11.900 --> 29:17.320]  kind of a private notion of children. Your kid is yours and totally your responsibility.
[29:17.320 --> 29:21.400]  We haven't had a very collective notion of these are our children. So part of it is we
[29:21.400 --> 29:25.480]  have to break through our kind of private idea that kids belong to their parents or
[29:25.480 --> 29:29.140]  kids belong to their families and recognize that kids belong to whole communities.
[29:29.140 --> 29:33.160]  Once it's everybody's responsibility and not just the households, then we start making
[29:33.160 --> 29:34.960]  better investments.
[29:34.960 --> 29:43.560]  All right, folks, we'll be right back. That's official MSNBC and courts have said in California
[29:43.560 --> 29:47.960]  your kids don't belong to you. And they've also come out and said they'll give kids shots
[29:47.960 --> 29:49.680]  without your consent.
[29:49.680 --> 29:56.880]  We're on the march. The Empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[29:56.880 --> 30:05.400]  In the last two years alone, the U.S. has seen huge losses to our food supply in 2011
[30:05.400 --> 30:10.680]  storms and floods raged across the U.S., costing us 20 billion in lost crops alone. In 2012,
[30:10.680 --> 30:14.920]  we saw the largest drought in the country in more than 50 years. You may think out of
[30:14.920 --> 30:19.420]  sight, out of mind. And so you don't think you will be affected. The fact is you are.
[30:19.420 --> 30:24.380]  We all are. Food shortages drive prices up for everyone. You might not be able to control
[30:24.380 --> 30:29.280]  Mother Nature, but you can control your food prices by freezing the cost and availability
[30:29.280 --> 30:33.560]  of your food supply with E Foods Direct. Be prepared before you need it with nutrient

[33:02.840 --> 33:09.840]  The answer to 1984 is 1776. You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[33:32.840 --> 33:44.480]  Monday through Friday, from 11 a.m. until 2 p.m. Central Standard Time, we are here
[33:44.480 --> 33:51.120]  live, ladies and gentlemen. And we, of course, are back weeknight, 7 o'clock, with InfoWars
[33:51.120 --> 33:56.040]  Nightly News. I'm just gonna get a 10-minute update from Dr. Steve Puchenik here, and then
[33:56.040 --> 34:00.960]  I'm gonna get back into all the world news and the incredible attacks that are accelerating
[34:00.960 --> 34:03.600]  on the First Amendment, you name it, the ATF.
[34:03.600 --> 34:09.280]  On the federal website has put out the bid for data mining to spy illegally on all gun
[34:09.280 --> 34:14.940]  owners and your web activity. Google, the NSA front, is breaking into all the computers
[34:14.940 --> 34:21.320]  with its Google cars and other systems with passcodes, stealing your data for the NSA
[34:21.320 --> 34:22.880]  and the foreign six banks that run it.
[34:22.880 --> 34:29.600]  I mean, it is just wall-to-wall criminal activity. There are tens of thousands of private intelligence
[34:29.600 --> 34:35.640]  groups now that have been given full national security access to everything. So understand,
[34:35.640 --> 34:40.480]  it's not just Nixon spying on you with your IRS records, and he was gonna go to jail for
[34:40.480 --> 34:42.240]  that until he stepped down.
[34:42.240 --> 34:51.760]  Now thousands and thousands, including quasi-foreign mercenary groups, are given above top-secret
[34:51.760 --> 34:56.360]  clearances to listen to your phones, get in your computers, your bank accounts, and they
[34:56.360 --> 35:01.560]  put it on the news. Intelligence agencies, look at your bank account every day. Intelligence
[35:01.560 --> 35:04.760]  agencies, listen to you, private contractors.
[35:04.760 --> 35:10.560]  I mean, it is just the age of the criminal. Every criminal on Earth turned loose, the
[35:10.560 --> 35:15.400]  government recruiting them, to absolutely implode and rob everyone. This is like the
[35:15.400 --> 35:20.720]  French Revolution, the Jacobins, the opposite of our revolution. This is an Illuminati crazy
[35:20.720 --> 35:23.400]  person orgy.
[35:23.400 --> 35:29.640]  We're seeing a wall-to-wall orgy with the TSA, their vanguard, openly training us to
[35:29.640 --> 35:34.460]  be groped, to have our families groped for prisoner training. And they're buying billions
[35:34.460 --> 35:38.440]  of bullets and armored vehicles and setting up checkpoints all over the place and putting
[35:38.440 --> 35:39.960]  the military on the street.
[35:39.960 --> 35:47.300]  I mean, they are just running wild. And their main drive is destroying the family, destroying
[35:47.300 --> 35:52.760]  men and women, destroying normalcy. This is a group of mentally ill deviants. What do
[35:52.760 --> 35:56.320]  you think the Nazis were? A bunch of deviants. What do you think the communists were? A bunch
[35:56.320 --> 35:57.320]  of deviants.
[35:57.320 --> 36:02.260]  I mean, have you read about Hitler, Mao Zedong, Stalin, Lenin? These are their own writings,
[36:02.260 --> 36:07.320]  the stuff they were into. Ultimate weirdos who don't like those of us that just wanna
[36:07.320 --> 36:11.320]  go home to our wife and kids and be normal, that never get tired of a steak, never get
[36:11.320 --> 36:17.080]  tired of fishing, never get tired of a sunset, never get tired of our wives, of our husbands.
[36:17.080 --> 36:23.960]  We are anathema to them. They like burning cities, starving children, black uniforms,
[36:23.960 --> 36:29.780]  hell on earth. And I, for one, have had enough of it. I've had enough of it. And it's time
[36:29.780 --> 36:35.840]  for the strong and the decent and the normal to rise up and to call out the enemy and call
[36:35.840 --> 36:36.960]  it out for what it is.
[36:36.960 --> 36:42.240]  They are on mainstream news. I have the Fox News. And Fox News is like, is this good?
[36:42.240 --> 36:48.120]  They're like, well, maybe. All Catholics and all evangelical Christians listed in a file,
[36:48.120 --> 36:53.000]  let's show people, as being with Al-Qaeda. It shows their names and they teach the military,
[36:53.000 --> 36:57.160]  that's extremism. Army labeled evangelicals as religious extremists, let's scroll down.
[36:57.160 --> 37:02.080]  And it actually shows the document, if you click on it if you're watching on TV at prison.tv,
[37:02.080 --> 37:07.680]  right next to it. You can actually just blow it up then, just blow it up there on the screen
[37:07.680 --> 37:08.680]  for everybody.
[37:08.680 --> 37:12.400]  You can just go back to the actual page and just blow it up on that screen like I did
[37:12.400 --> 37:17.960]  yesterday. And then it's right side up. It's just incredible. This is a psychological warfare
[37:17.960 --> 37:24.020]  tactic where they're totally beyond gaslighting everyone. They are just creating total learned
[37:24.020 --> 37:31.260]  helplessness and a mass Stockholm syndrome effect using normalcy bias.
[37:31.260 --> 37:37.600]  And they are on purpose frying everyone's brains right now, with MSNBC officially in
[37:37.600 --> 37:42.280]  promo saying, the state runs your children, the collective is here. We're taking your
[37:42.280 --> 37:46.700]  guns and they've got their talking point minions calling in to talk radio going. There are
[37:46.700 --> 37:51.880]  no bullets, there are no drones, there are no checkpoints, there is no TSA, the healthcare
[37:51.880 --> 37:54.120]  is all free, everything is wonderful.
[37:54.120 --> 37:58.720]  And you hear them giggling and snickering, saying to the host, I heard it this morning,
[37:58.720 --> 38:01.680]  calling in in a group. The host didn't even know what was happening as I was driving into
[38:01.680 --> 38:07.320]  work on 590 going, that's just in your chain emails. None of this is happening. None of
[38:07.320 --> 38:11.720]  this is happening as if we're so weak minded, they sit there and tell us this isn't happening.
[38:11.720 --> 38:15.760]  I'm sorry, let's go to Dr. Steve Pechenik, who doesn't need an introduction. He flew
[38:15.760 --> 38:19.640]  out there to cover it, former top hostage negotiator for the State Department and crisis
[38:19.640 --> 38:20.640]  manager.
[38:20.640 --> 38:23.960]  Helped get the Camp David Accords through, was involved with General Boykin founding
[38:23.960 --> 38:30.300]  Delta Force in 1979. And has also been involved using psychological warfare to overthrow governments.
[38:30.300 --> 38:33.480]  And he says, he just told us during the break, he's gotta leave very soon because they're
[38:33.480 --> 38:38.600]  putting major pressure on him now. The globalist intelligence groups to kick him out of the
[38:38.600 --> 38:45.000]  country. And he's there on the DMZ with official, well, the Korean government because they know
[38:45.000 --> 38:49.600]  him, he was involved in the democratization of the country, has got an attache attached
[38:49.600 --> 38:50.600]  to him.
[38:50.600 --> 38:54.200]  And he can give us a report on what's happening to him right now and the latest from North
[38:54.200 --> 38:57.880]  Korea. But first off, Doc, what do you think about my rant about authoritarianism?
[38:57.880 --> 39:06.280]  You know, it's ironic. You and I have telepathic feelings. You're far more assertive and a
[39:06.280 --> 39:12.040]  little bit, quite frankly, without being facetious, you're far more historically referenced. I
[39:12.040 --> 39:15.960]  was so impressed with the Plato and the Nietzsche reference that I was taken aback and I had
[39:15.960 --> 39:20.200]  to go read some. But let me just get back to exactly what you were saying. This is not
[39:20.200 --> 39:25.240]  a rant. Let's make it very clear. One of the things that I learned here on the DMZ's own
[39:25.240 --> 39:30.360]  and in Korea and in interviewing our soldiers, our special soldiers, soldiers coming out
[39:30.360 --> 39:35.120]  of the Ranger schools in Fort Lewis is one thing. And I've learned it repeatedly. That
[39:35.120 --> 39:41.240]  was the one reason why I came here. Number one, this problem is not our problem. We have
[39:41.240 --> 39:46.840]  contributed to this problem in South Korea through many, many ways. I would not be surprised
[39:46.840 --> 39:53.200]  that our POTUS, Obama and Hillary, when they went to Myanmar, decided that when we shifted
[39:53.200 --> 40:00.360]  all our assets into the Far East, including our sink pack, as well as Marines into Australia,
[40:00.360 --> 40:06.080]  there was no reason for it. We don't need now military forces in order to re-ensure
[40:06.080 --> 40:11.880]  our financial interests. What I found now in South Korea was exactly the opposite of
[40:11.880 --> 40:16.840]  what you found in America and what I have found. And we've come to the same conclusion.
[40:16.840 --> 40:23.020]  I came out of here yesterday after coming to the DMZ, talking to hundreds of South Koreans.
[40:23.020 --> 40:29.600]  There was not one South Korean, despite this whole crisis in warm hungry, who was upset,
[40:29.600 --> 40:36.000]  disgusted with America, or upset about some Kim Jong-un, and they thought it was a joke.
[40:36.000 --> 40:41.440]  They had a highly amount of disrespect for us. They said we should leave. And I've said
[40:41.440 --> 40:47.680]  that for 20 years. We do not need a base in Seoul. That base is worth billions of dollars.
[40:47.680 --> 40:52.960]  We have made a lot of money by selling it back to South Korea. They have asked us for
[40:52.960 --> 40:58.560]  repeatedly to leave. South Korea does not need our help. North Korea will go through
[40:58.560 --> 41:04.840]  its own crisis as a baby goes through its crisis, and eventually it will resolve itself.
[41:04.840 --> 41:10.040]  Our business is not to respond to symptoms, it's to prevent them. If we have any effective
[41:10.040 --> 41:15.200]  system, it should be in the prevention of crisis. That's really prevention. But instead,
[41:15.200 --> 41:21.560]  we have a president, we've had three sequiturs, sequestering presidents, Clinton, Bush, and
[41:21.560 --> 41:28.560]  Obama, who have repeatedly gone into rendition, and into sequestration, and into wars that
[41:28.560 --> 41:35.120]  were false, and have continuously lied to the American public. I cannot emphasize enough
[41:35.120 --> 41:41.160]  your impassioned as well as mine. Now, I've worked with five, six presidents. None of
[41:41.160 --> 41:47.800]  them were as vitriolic in their attempt to control the American public for everything
[41:47.800 --> 41:52.800]  that everybody said about Nixon. He never tried to control the American public. He looked
[41:52.800 --> 41:59.320]  at the IRS. He created a lot of welfare programs. We went to a war that he did not want. It
[41:59.320 --> 42:05.040]  was started by John F. Kennedy and LBJ, who had the dignity to leave. We have people in
[42:05.040 --> 42:11.760]  the White House who have no dignity, no competency, and who are totally sociopaths. We have a
[42:11.760 --> 42:18.280]  military industrial complex that's creating and fomenting these so-called crises. I knew
[42:18.280 --> 42:24.080]  the minute we were shifting our entire sink tank, our Navy, and our Marines into Australia
[42:24.080 --> 42:31.640]  while Hillary and Obama were conniving in Myanmar, Burma, I knew we would be getting
[42:31.640 --> 42:38.120]  into trouble in the South China Sea. We are irrelevant. I cannot tell you, after talking
[42:38.120 --> 42:45.400]  to hundreds of intelligence operatives here, Koreans, we are so irrelevant, they are so
[42:45.400 --> 42:50.040]  prosperous, that when I look back at this entire issue, do you know what I come out
[42:50.040 --> 42:55.960]  of it with? The same conclusion you came out of it. I go through TSA, I had to go twice
[42:55.960 --> 43:03.680]  through three times to TSA in Miami, San Francisco, and elsewhere. They were pathetic. The minorities
[43:03.680 --> 43:08.720]  who ran it were illiterate. They could not speak English. The ones who could speak English
[43:08.720 --> 43:13.560]  were dumb. And they were looking at things that were totally irrelevant. There is no
[43:13.560 --> 43:20.880]  counter-terrorism. There is no security. What we have created is a dysfunctional, self-destructive
[43:20.880 --> 43:26.320]  government. It must stop. It will not stop from the constitutional amendments that we
[43:26.320 --> 43:32.080]  have or our legislators. They are incompetent. The Constitution is antiquated. We have to
[43:32.080 --> 43:37.800]  renovate it. We have to get rid of our legislators. They do no longer represent our interests.
[43:37.800 --> 43:43.680]  It's crony capitalism. And we can no longer really abide by presidential elections. It's
[43:43.680 --> 43:52.760]  just a joke. It's just one CIA asset. As many as most people won't realize, even Clinton,
[43:52.760 --> 44:00.880]  the slick willy, a total sociopath, a drug addict, was recruited at Yale as a CIA asset.
[44:00.880 --> 44:06.320]  I was on the board in the Fulbright, where we gave out Fulbright scholarships to CIA
[44:06.320 --> 44:11.080]  potential candidates when he went to Oxford and his roommate was strove to hell, but he
[44:11.080 --> 44:15.840]  never even finished the education. He ended up in Moscow, elsewhere. He doesn't talk
[44:15.840 --> 44:22.400]  about it. Then he goes to MENA, services our CIA through drugs and to the third-world country.
[44:22.400 --> 44:29.880]  Then we get Bush, who's a total moron, completely CIA asset, run by Cheney, run by a whole group
[44:29.880 --> 44:35.240]  of guys who were dysfunctional and were thrown out by Bush Sr., and yet they come up to the
[44:35.240 --> 44:38.880]  top because of the power elite within the Republican Party.
[44:38.880 --> 44:40.600]  Sure, and Doc, let's tie this in.
[44:40.600 --> 44:41.800]  That power elite will destroy itself.
[44:41.800 --> 44:44.760]  Sure, you're there on the DMZ. I want to get a little bit into that before you've got to
[44:44.760 --> 44:49.080]  leave us. But look at how Rumsfeld, in the mid-'90s with Clinton, helps transfer the
[44:49.080 --> 44:53.880]  reactors that are the type that could create the fissile material for A-bombs. Look at
[44:53.880 --> 44:57.920]  how you said the big defense contractors are there trying to sell weapons to everybody
[44:57.920 --> 45:04.440]  during this crisis. They stand to gain from destabilization instead of just having a free
[45:04.440 --> 45:08.960]  market system. You were telling me yesterday how you were in the restaurant surrounded
[45:08.960 --> 45:14.280]  by CIA people casing you. You told Chris you've got to split soon because they're starting
[45:14.280 --> 45:16.000]  to put pressure on you.
[45:16.000 --> 45:18.840]  Describe the atmosphere there, because here it is, North Korea show signs-
[45:18.840 --> 45:23.840]  Here's the atmosphere. It's very clear. On the DMZ zone, in some ways, I'm a lot more
[45:23.840 --> 45:28.480]  protected because there's very little they can do to me. Either there's no grounds on
[45:28.480 --> 45:33.480]  which they can arrest me because, basically, I'm providing information literally to you
[45:33.480 --> 45:38.840]  and to the American public. I have not violated the First Amendment. What's happening is I'm
[45:38.840 --> 45:46.760]  seeing more and more surrounding me within other confines, in Seoul and the DMZ, more
[45:46.760 --> 45:52.280]  and more American soldiers who stand out, who really have no idea of what they're doing.
[45:52.280 --> 45:58.080]  In Fort Lewis, for Fort Bragg, I asked them repeatedly, what is your mission statement?
[45:58.080 --> 46:02.560]  I don't want their secrecy. They say, it's so complex. I say, why is it so complex when
[46:02.560 --> 46:08.240]  there's psychological warfare? I asked them, how many weeks did you get in military intelligence
[46:08.240 --> 46:13.480]  at Fort Wachuca, which is what we do in military intelligence? You know how many weeks? Two
[46:13.480 --> 46:14.480]  weeks, it was worthless.
[46:14.480 --> 46:15.480]  No, they're babies.
[46:15.480 --> 46:18.640]  Not just babies, they're the point here in our country.
[46:18.640 --> 46:22.520]  Well, they say complex because they don't know.
[46:22.520 --> 46:28.560]  No, they know. What's happening is they're being brainwashed by a competent system that
[46:28.560 --> 46:35.880]  no longer functions. Let me put it simply, as you said, in medicine, we say to the patient,
[46:35.880 --> 46:42.960]  above all else, do no harm. Here, we have done harm to Korea. We have done harm to Pakistan.
[46:42.960 --> 46:48.960]  We have done harm to Afghanistan. We have done harm to Iraq, to Syria, to the world.
[46:48.960 --> 46:55.960]  It is time to come back to our country, rehabilitate ourselves, take care of ourselves, the Korean
[46:55.960 --> 47:02.960]  Peninsula has better traffic, better infrastructure, cleaner places than we do.
[47:02.960 --> 47:07.120]  Sure. You've heard of will to power. You've heard of will to power. What about will to
[47:07.120 --> 47:08.120]  evil?
[47:08.120 --> 47:14.840]  Well, it's not will to evil. Alex, I have to a little bit disagree what I talked about,
[47:14.840 --> 47:20.480]  and most people don't understand it. Twenty years ago, I publicly stated that Bush Jr.
[47:20.480 --> 47:28.160]  in an American public was following a self-destructive course of the republic and in turn creating
[47:28.160 --> 47:34.000]  an empire. We are no longer a republic and we will die like Rome, but what we are in
[47:34.000 --> 47:41.440]  an empire is we have centurion guards in sync packs, SOCOM, CENTCOM, all these fancy words
[47:41.440 --> 47:46.840]  including Petraeus, Jim Dempsey, the worst chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff I've
[47:46.840 --> 47:51.960]  ever seen, Admiral Mullen, the worst chiefs of staff I've ever had. If we had Eisenhower,
[47:51.960 --> 47:56.920]  we had Patton, we have a George Marshall, these men would have been fired. You're not,
[47:56.920 --> 48:01.320]  you're talking about six, seven hundred men within 30 days. Any one of us who fought in
[48:01.320 --> 48:05.960]  the Korean War or World War Two and my family fought in the Korean War, these men would
[48:05.960 --> 48:11.400]  have been summarily fired. We don't have that because the leadership is incompetent, it's
[48:11.400 --> 48:15.400]  dysfunctional, and we're continuing to go into a self-destructive course.
[48:15.400 --> 48:19.600]  Sure, they watch their own CIA produced movies, worshiping themselves and actually drink their
[48:19.600 --> 48:20.600]  own Kool-Aid.
[48:20.600 --> 48:25.920]  Well, that's true, but they produce the movies in order to create for themselves a fantasy
[48:25.920 --> 48:26.920]  that they want to see.
[48:26.920 --> 48:32.120]  No, I know, they're a bunch of delusional peacocks.
[48:32.120 --> 48:36.640]  None of them, none of them are effective assassins. There were times that I sat there and I couldn't
[48:36.640 --> 48:41.360]  believe it. They had a subcontract down in Lebanon, and I won't give the name because
[48:41.360 --> 48:45.960]  he knows exactly what I'm talking about, where they literally blew up 84 innocent men and
[48:45.960 --> 48:51.920]  women. Years later, I looked at him and I said, this is impossible. On the other hand,
[48:51.920 --> 48:58.120]  we have had some great CIA leaders like Don Gregg, Jim Lilly, Paul Redman, all of whom
[48:58.120 --> 49:05.480]  were bred out of the old OSS and were dedicated selflessly to our country. But we now have
[49:05.480 --> 49:11.760]  a CIA that is as lazy and incompetent as our generals. They are overpaid because they're
[49:11.760 --> 49:16.800]  funded by third party payments. So instead of coming into our agency, they're funded
[49:16.800 --> 49:24.160]  by the ASAIC, Northrop Grumman, Lockheed, L3 Communications, and you'll see they get
[49:24.160 --> 49:30.560]  double the pay and half the capability. We do not need the CIA. We do not need this military.
[49:30.560 --> 49:36.320]  It is dysfunctional. If the American public understands how self-destruction, we have
[49:36.320 --> 49:44.080]  lost every single war since World War Two. We have lost the Korean War, the Vietnam War.
[49:44.080 --> 49:49.560]  We have gone into an absurd war. Absolutely. Bottom line, bottom line. What's the current
[49:49.560 --> 49:58.520]  situation? We have lost the Pakistan War. We have lost the Korean, the Egyptian War,
[49:58.520 --> 50:04.240]  Libya. And so we have a bunch of liberals. We have a bunch of idiot Republicans who have
[50:04.240 --> 50:09.480]  no idea about foreign policy. It is time to devolve the government. And if we can't do
[50:09.480 --> 50:15.200]  that, then separate the United States into the effective components it belongs to. And
[50:15.200 --> 50:20.080]  that's what I've said in the state of emergency. I have repeatedly stated let the governors
[50:20.080 --> 50:25.320]  take care of their own states and the rest be damned. The federal government is a totally
[50:25.320 --> 50:33.120]  useless cancer on our American way of life. If we do not change the Constitution, eliminate
[50:33.120 --> 50:39.760]  the representatives who are totally fat and lazy and incompetent. And if we do not eliminate
[50:39.760 --> 50:43.960]  our generals who are incompetent. He's all the way in South Korea. Sometimes he's I think
[50:43.960 --> 50:48.320]  loses our audio, but we may get one more update tomorrow specifically on what's happening
[50:48.320 --> 50:53.080]  on the DMZ. But it's just a bunch of warmongering by all sides to grandstand and make government
[50:53.080 --> 50:58.580]  bigger and make the public more scared. Just like staging terror attacks, Kim Jong Un stages
[50:58.580 --> 51:04.800]  these events. Imagine waking one morning only to find your family shivering in the dark
[51:04.800 --> 51:09.760]  because you couldn't afford to pay your electric bill. That's closer than you think. You probably
[51:09.760 --> 51:13.780]  hadn't heard about this yet because the liberal media has been suppressing what is fast becoming
[51:13.780 --> 51:20.000]  the most shocking news story of 2012. Obama's secret war on coal that could increase your
[51:20.000 --> 51:26.040]  already high power bill as much as 400% in coming months. As shocking as it sounds, it
[51:26.040 --> 51:30.880]  will be just a matter of time before the lights start going out across America. But here's
[51:30.880 --> 51:36.880]  some good news. There's an underground video at exposed123.com that thousands of smart
[51:36.880 --> 51:41.860]  patriots have used to end their slavery to the corrupt electricity monopoly. The video
[51:41.860 --> 51:47.080]  at exposed123.com has already been banned by Google. And the liberal media is doing
[51:47.080 --> 51:51.440]  everything in its power to take it down and keep America in the dark. So watch it now
[51:51.440 --> 51:56.760]  at exposed123.com before it's too late. Again, that's exposed123.com.
[51:56.760 --> 52:05.160]  In the last two years alone, the US has seen huge losses to our food supply. In 2011, storms
[52:05.160 --> 52:10.400]  and floods raged across the US costing us 20 billion in lost crops alone. In 2012, we
[52:10.400 --> 52:14.720]  saw the largest drought in the country in more than 50 years. You may think out of sight,
[52:14.720 --> 52:19.920]  out of mind, and so you don't think you will be affected. The fact is you are. We all are.
[52:19.920 --> 52:24.640]  Food shortages drive prices up for everyone. You might not be able to control mother nature,
[52:24.640 --> 52:29.720]  but you can control your food prices by freezing the cost and availability of your food supply
[52:29.720 --> 52:33.640]  with E Foods Direct. Be prepared before you need it. With nutrient dense food you can

[53:56.160 --> 54:14.840]  Water Filters, for the love of clean water. All right, folks. Yeah, Dr. Pechenik is in
[54:14.840 --> 54:19.040]  South Korea. And that's why he couldn't hear me sometimes. The line sounds pretty good,
[54:19.040 --> 54:23.760]  but sometimes it's only one way. Kind of like cell phones do that sometimes. He's telling
[54:23.760 --> 54:27.720]  me a lot during the breaks. Bottom line, he's saying his access is being denied. He's being
[54:27.720 --> 54:31.200]  blocked. He's got folks creeping around, but he wanna make a big deal out of that.
[54:31.200 --> 54:35.560]  But he has had a chance to talk to a lot of the military. And they said that there basically
[54:35.560 --> 54:41.380]  is no mission. I mean, the mission is look like they're doing something. But it's all
[54:41.380 --> 54:46.400]  for show. Just like North Korea pretty much is all for show. But if it gets too escalated,
[54:46.400 --> 54:53.080]  North Korea has attacked before. And so the big thing is, he believes don't stir it all
[54:53.080 --> 54:58.480]  up. So the West has an excuse to dominate that area of Asia, and that things might end
[54:58.480 --> 55:00.800]  up good down the road.
[55:00.800 --> 55:03.560]  Is that an accurate statement in closing, Dr. Pechenik?
[55:03.560 --> 55:09.440]  Yeah, the basic two points that everybody has to look at is, April 15th is the anniversary
[55:09.440 --> 55:15.680]  Kim Il Sung. April 30th, you may see rockets in celebration. But let me tell you very simply,
[55:15.680 --> 55:20.920]  we are irrelevant. The North Korea is irrelevant. The only country that's relevant right here
[55:20.920 --> 55:24.600]  is South Korea. And quite frankly, they do not need our military help.
[55:24.600 --> 55:29.240]  It's as simple as that. And let us get out of every other country and worry about our
[55:29.240 --> 55:31.600]  own country. That's the summary.
[55:31.600 --> 55:35.880]  Well the empire is getting more delusional when the White House press secretary, former
[55:35.880 --> 55:41.860]  secretary gets up and says, I'm told to lie to everybody. And then the MSNBC host laugh.
[55:41.860 --> 55:48.840]  What do you make of their move to get our guns? And MSNBC host saying things like, your
[55:48.840 --> 55:54.000]  children belong to the state. That's being run as an hourly promo. What are they trying
[55:54.000 --> 55:55.000]  to do?
[55:55.000 --> 55:59.040]  The whole point of the state running, the government running the United States of America
[55:59.040 --> 56:04.840]  has got two issues. One, it's totally self-delusion. Two, it's out of desperation. Three, it's
[56:04.840 --> 56:10.480]  total incompetency. Number four, there is no way in hell that the US federal government
[56:10.480 --> 56:16.000]  can run anything other than barely itself, because there's no way they're gonna garner
[56:16.000 --> 56:23.840]  300 million guns. I carry, I conceal weapons. Half of the South that I know carries concealed
[56:23.840 --> 56:29.960]  weapons and quoting physicians, everyone else. So, you know, Obama has no idea what America's
[56:29.960 --> 56:36.040]  about. Nobody in Washington DC has an idea about America. Nobody's ever read American
[56:36.040 --> 56:41.600]  Revolution or George Washington. We're born of the gun, not because we want to kill. We're
[56:41.600 --> 56:46.480]  born of the gun because we have always been mistrustful of George Washington having said
[56:46.480 --> 56:51.640]  the following, do not make a president, he will eventually become a king. If he is a
[56:51.640 --> 56:56.880]  king, then we will have to depose him. That's what we're about. We're a democracy. It's
[56:56.880 --> 57:01.320]  time to come home, take care of ourselves, take care of our children, bring back our
[57:01.320 --> 57:07.440]  army that has lost all the wars since the Second World War. Get rid of the CIA, get
[57:07.440 --> 57:08.440]  rid of-
[57:08.440 --> 57:13.920]  Sure, if they think the globalists are gonna dominate America, they couldn't even hold
[57:13.920 --> 57:19.320]  Baghdad. Resistance is victory, and all the billions of bullets and all of it is blustered
[57:19.320 --> 57:24.040]  by a criminal group that knows they should all be going to jail for the too big to fail.
[57:24.040 --> 57:30.000]  And look, Americans buying hundreds of millions of guns a year, hundreds of millions, folks.
[57:30.000 --> 57:35.320]  Americans, the last two years, 70 million background checks to buy guns, and half of
[57:35.320 --> 57:40.080]  them out there aren't even through that system. The people are voting, buying the bullets.
[57:40.080 --> 57:44.920]  America is actually awake. It's a psy-op that we're not awake. It's a psy-op that we've
[57:44.920 --> 57:50.520]  embraced communism. It's all a load of bull, and I only hope that we can shift back to
[57:50.520 --> 57:54.920]  the state's 10th Amendment before it goes to a full bore civil war.
[57:54.920 --> 58:01.400]  We will get back our power, trust me. I have a full faith in the American public. That's
[58:01.400 --> 58:06.360]  why I came forth, tried to sacrifice my life. I don't wanna make myself a hero. This is
[58:06.360 --> 58:12.040]  the 10th time. I did it eight times to the United States government without any remuneration,
[58:12.040 --> 58:18.000]  but I won our army. I won intelligence. I won the White House, and I won every other
[58:18.000 --> 58:24.760]  institution, particularly the TSA, Homeland Security, the FBI, and every other element
[58:24.760 --> 58:31.360]  that is there to continue their self-destructive behavior, America will retaliate. They have
[58:31.360 --> 58:36.760]  no idea what the American public is like from the east coast to the west coast and the north
[58:36.760 --> 58:38.720]  coast. Absolutely. God bless you. God, thanks for
[58:38.720 --> 58:46.440]  coming on with us. This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio
[58:46.440 --> 58:52.760]  Network. A little over a year ago, I began to do a
[58:52.760 --> 58:57.760]  lot of research into why, even if I had a pretty good-sized meal, that I was still starving.
[58:57.760 --> 59:02.760]  My research led me to a well-known fact that most of the soils that we grow our crops on
[59:02.760 --> 59:07.920]  here in the United States and across the industrialized world are almost completely depleted of almost
[59:07.920 --> 59:13.640]  all of the key minerals and trace elements that our bodies need to rebuild themselves,
[59:13.640 --> 59:18.680]  fight off cancer, and be healthy. I then searched out the best vitamin and mineral
[59:18.680 --> 59:23.680]  company out there and discovered Youngchevity. The Youngchevity products are designed to
[59:23.680 --> 59:28.080]  give you the real nutrition you need, and once you've got that, you don't have to eat
[59:28.080 --> 59:34.700]  as much to be satisfied. I've lost 37 pounds in two months, simply getting the vitamins
[59:34.700 --> 59:40.540]  and minerals I need. Check it out for yourself. It's incredible. Go to InfowarsTeam.com today

[59:49.760 --> 59:58.760]  Waging war on corruption, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:04.760 --> 01:00:12.760]  Big Brother. Mainstream media. Government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does he.
[01:00:12.760 --> 01:00:21.760]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:21.760 --> 01:00:45.760]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are live. Thank you so much for joining us. We're now into hour
[01:00:45.760 --> 01:00:52.760]  number two. Dan Bongino, the former Secret Service agent, who has spoken out for the
[01:00:52.760 --> 01:00:58.760]  Second Amendment eloquently, will be popping in to join us at the bottom of the hour. You've
[01:00:58.760 --> 01:01:05.760]  heard Dr. Pachenik on the last three shows in a row, and he definitely is a very interesting
[01:01:05.760 --> 01:01:10.760]  person, with a long history at the highest levels of the, quote, intelligence community.
[01:01:10.760 --> 01:01:15.760]  And the whole government and homeland security system has become like a movie star thing,
[01:01:15.760 --> 01:01:20.760]  where they're secret agents and they're cool because they have this title. And it's all
[01:01:20.760 --> 01:01:26.760]  just a bunch of bad liars who are bringing drugs into the country and building a prison
[01:01:26.760 --> 01:01:33.760]  state, basically reintroducing slavery to America, and exporting predatory government
[01:01:33.760 --> 01:01:37.760]  everywhere because these people don't know how to produce anything.
[01:01:37.760 --> 01:01:44.760]  They're the opposite of a renaissance. They are an authoritarian cancer. And you've got
[01:01:44.760 --> 01:01:50.760]  people like Dr. Pachenik, who's, you can go look up news articles where they finger him
[01:01:50.760 --> 01:01:54.760]  overthrowing governments and manipulating the communists to kill the prime minister
[01:01:54.760 --> 01:02:00.760]  of Italy, and just right there running the Camp David Accords at the start of Delta Force.
[01:02:00.760 --> 01:02:06.760]  I mean, he really is an insider insider. And he's here, first came on with us like 12 years
[01:02:06.760 --> 01:02:15.760]  ago because I saw a blurb where he'd put out on his website that Bin Laden had died a long
[01:02:15.760 --> 01:02:19.760]  time ago, and he showed even mainstream articles admitting that he was dying of kidney failure
[01:02:19.760 --> 01:02:21.760]  a year before, CBS News and stuff.
[01:02:21.760 --> 01:02:27.760]  So I called and got him on, and that created a storm in the Council on Foreign Relations.
[01:02:27.760 --> 01:02:32.760]  I'll put it to you that way. And a bunch of stuff happened behind the scenes that I'm
[01:02:32.760 --> 01:02:37.760]  not at liberty to discuss. But you need to understand, ladies and gentlemen, the Pentagon
[01:02:37.760 --> 01:02:44.760]  listens to this show, okay? I'm not bragging. For me, I'm just a regular guy, puts his pants
[01:02:44.760 --> 01:02:47.760]  on one leg at a time.
[01:02:47.760 --> 01:02:53.760]  In fact, one of my biggest problems is I don't put on airs and act like I'm on a power trip,
[01:02:53.760 --> 01:02:59.760]  which to the general public means everything nowadays, like a peacock or a parrot displaying
[01:02:59.760 --> 01:03:09.760]  feathers. We under-promise, over-deliver here. I mean, we're making history. And I say that
[01:03:09.760 --> 01:03:15.760]  so people know we're like on a trench run through the Death Star. And this is not a
[01:03:15.760 --> 01:03:16.760]  joke.
[01:03:16.760 --> 01:03:23.760]  I mean, I don't know how anybody out there can be bored. I don't know how anybody can
[01:03:23.760 --> 01:03:29.760]  sit there and watch our criminal government give the reactors to make the A-bombs in North
[01:03:29.760 --> 01:03:39.760]  Korea 17 years ago bipartisan. Here's the deal, the elite are dysfunctional. They've
[01:03:39.760 --> 01:03:47.760]  got a cosmology and a philosophy of eugenics.
[01:03:47.760 --> 01:03:53.760]  But they're not serious people, even in their own ideology. They're just a bunch of crooks.
[01:03:53.760 --> 01:03:59.760]  I mean, they've just WikiLeaks a whole bunch of documents, millions of pages of it, they're
[01:03:59.760 --> 01:04:07.760]  saying. And it's Stephen Kissinger talking about all the crimes he's committing and how
[01:04:07.760 --> 01:04:12.760]  we can do the criminal stuff right away, the illegal stuff right away.
[01:04:12.760 --> 01:04:19.760]  That's a quote, but the unconstitutional stuff will have to wait till later. And that's
[01:04:19.760 --> 01:04:23.760]  why they make fun of the Constitution, the Bill of Rights all day. Because if you follow
[01:04:23.760 --> 01:04:29.760]  the Bill of Rights, the Constitution, it binds down tyrants. The only problem is it produces
[01:04:29.760 --> 01:04:34.760]  so much freedom and so much wealth that everybody becomes decadent slobs.
[01:04:34.760 --> 01:04:45.760]  And when you're fat, dumb and happy, you don't care anymore. 1.7 million diplomatic cables
[01:04:45.760 --> 01:04:53.760]  released with Eric Kissinger in there. We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen, with
[01:04:53.760 --> 01:04:59.760]  a ton of news straight ahead. Stay with us.

[01:06:05.760 --> 01:06:10.760]  economic system runs from bad to worse. The globalist model is to shut down societies

[01:07:55.760 --> 01:08:13.760]  Big brother. Mainstream media. Government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does he. He's Alex
[01:08:13.760 --> 01:08:21.760]  Jones on the GCN radio network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:08:21.760 --> 01:08:25.760]  All right, we're into hour number two, and I still haven't mentioned, obviously, that
[01:08:25.760 --> 01:08:32.760]  Margaret Thatcher died. We've got coverage of that up at infowars.com. We've got several
[01:08:32.760 --> 01:08:41.760]  guests joining us, including a Secret Service agent that's spoken out for the Second Amendment.
[01:08:41.760 --> 01:08:47.760]  There's a lot of amazing news out there today. You know, some of it is just so ridiculous.
[01:08:47.760 --> 01:08:58.760]  It came out in USA Today a few years ago that 73% of Obama's Twitter followers are fake.
[01:08:58.760 --> 01:09:04.760]  And of course, of course, they're fake. And now it's come out that Obama doesn't control
[01:09:04.760 --> 01:09:09.760]  his own Twitter account. Well, of course, he doesn't. The guy is a total and complete
[01:09:09.760 --> 01:09:16.760]  puppet. And all of this, why does North Korea love to grandstand and threaten to nuke?
[01:09:16.760 --> 01:09:20.760]  Why does the West love to grandstand and say we're on the edge of World War III? Because
[01:09:20.760 --> 01:09:25.760]  it gives government more power no matter what country you're in. Why did Homeland Security
[01:09:25.760 --> 01:09:32.760]  a month ago say, cut Homeland Security funding and terrorists will attack?
[01:09:32.760 --> 01:09:39.760]  Because they can never reverse their takeover. They've just got to expand it and expand it
[01:09:39.760 --> 01:09:47.760]  and expand it. They want to wreck society so they can consolidate it. That's what authoritarian
[01:09:47.760 --> 01:09:55.760]  centralized systems always do over and over.
[01:09:55.760 --> 01:10:01.760]  And there's articles out about the Democrats freaking out over Obamacare as their constituents
[01:10:01.760 --> 01:10:07.760]  learn that it doubles the price on average, that it doesn't cover preexisting and that
[01:10:07.760 --> 01:10:17.760]  they're just gonna get cut from full time to part time. And as doctors and people quit
[01:10:17.760 --> 01:10:24.760]  in mass, this is what it looks like when you let the ogres take over.
[01:10:24.760 --> 01:10:29.760]  All they know how to do is steal stuff, not build anything, not do anything. You think
[01:10:29.760 --> 01:10:33.760]  the government class is gonna work hard? You think the corporate class that works with
[01:10:33.760 --> 01:10:41.760]  government at the top? No, no, why should they work hard? Why should they innovate if
[01:10:41.760 --> 01:10:45.760]  they can just shut down their competition cuz they control the government?
[01:10:45.760 --> 01:10:56.760]  You become North Korea when you have this type of system in place. I want to open the
[01:10:56.760 --> 01:11:01.760]  phones up for first time callers here to give me your take on just how insane this world
[01:11:01.760 --> 01:11:08.760]  has gotten. You heard the clip we've played? MSNBC host, your kids belong to the collective.
[01:11:08.760 --> 01:11:17.760]  MSNBC host, your kids belong to the collective. And they now run promos saying your kids belong
[01:11:17.760 --> 01:11:24.760]  to the government.
[01:11:24.760 --> 01:11:32.760]  This is the incredible creepiness of what our society has become. And not only are we
[01:11:32.760 --> 01:11:39.760]  held hostage by Kim Jong-un, who Japan's freaking out cuz they can actually be hit by his nukes,
[01:11:39.760 --> 01:11:48.760]  there's no doubt about that. And just as government creates this abomination where this nobody
[01:11:48.760 --> 01:11:54.760]  joke is threatening to nuke the US and Japan. It's the same thing where these nobody jokes
[01:11:54.760 --> 01:11:58.760]  that have gotten in control of government are threatening terror attacks if we don't
[01:11:58.760 --> 01:12:02.760]  give them more money and let them stick their hands down our pants as an act of domination.
[01:12:02.760 --> 01:12:09.760]  That's what a crazy joke all this has become. I mean, look at this Fox News headline. Army
[01:12:09.760 --> 01:12:18.760]  manual, evangelicals are religious extremists. A US Army training instructor, well, no, it's
[01:12:18.760 --> 01:12:22.760]  the manual. This is Southern Poverty Law Center manual, it's what it is. I've seen it a hundred
[01:12:22.760 --> 01:12:23.760]  times, literally.
[01:12:23.760 --> 01:12:27.760]  Listed evangelical Christians and Catholicism as examples of religious extremism along with
[01:12:27.760 --> 01:12:32.760]  Al Qaeda, Hamas, during a briefing with the Army Reserve Unit based in Pennsylvania. Click
[01:12:32.760 --> 01:12:37.760]  here for the most important and then it goes through it. We find this offensive to have
[01:12:37.760 --> 01:12:44.760]  evangelical Christians and Catholic Church to be listed among it and then it goes on.
[01:12:44.760 --> 01:12:48.760]  Army spokesman George Wright told Fox News that it was an isolated incident not condoned
[01:12:48.760 --> 01:12:57.760]  by the Department of the Army, pure bull. Pure bull, that is Southern Poverty Law Center.
[01:12:57.760 --> 01:13:04.760]  I even recognize the way they format the text. If you pull up the MIAC reports, the Homeland
[01:13:04.760 --> 01:13:12.760]  Security reports, the FBI reports, there are literally over 100 modern FBI manuals. And
[01:13:12.760 --> 01:13:17.760]  it's all the same font officially put out by the Southern Poverty Law Center, the ADL
[01:13:17.760 --> 01:13:18.760]  has a hand in it.
[01:13:18.760 --> 01:13:25.760]  I mean, I instantly see it and know who did it. These are foreign groups who are here
[01:13:25.760 --> 01:13:31.760]  saying, if you're a gun owner, a conservative, a returning veteran, a Christian, period,
[01:13:31.760 --> 01:13:37.760]  you're a terrorist. These people bad mouth George Washington. And you know what, folks,
[01:13:37.760 --> 01:13:43.760]  if you wanna live under this, that's fine. I mean, I cannot believe that people go Alex
[01:13:43.760 --> 01:13:48.760]  Jones is radical, Alex Jones is scary, Alex Jones is spooky.
[01:13:48.760 --> 01:13:54.760]  And that's a Glenn Beck quote. I'm spooky. I'm spooky because I recognize what's going
[01:13:54.760 --> 01:13:58.760]  on. I'm freaking out about it, saying, hey, we're in deep trouble. No, I'm pointing out
[01:13:58.760 --> 01:14:07.760]  stuff that is spooky. I'm not spooky. I'm talking about things that are spooky, real
[01:14:07.760 --> 01:14:08.760]  spooky.
[01:14:08.760 --> 01:14:15.760]  I mean, we've got a bunch of people that have studied authoritarianism, and that are on
[01:14:15.760 --> 01:14:21.760]  giant out of control power trips who really want to have a pure authoritarian takeover.
[01:14:21.760 --> 01:14:31.760]  A toll free number to join us, 800-259-9231, 800-259-9231. Guys, can you queue up Joe Biden
[01:14:31.760 --> 01:14:36.760]  calling for a new world order? And then I saw headlines in Gawker and a bunch of other
[01:14:36.760 --> 01:14:43.760]  places saying, Christmas has come early, the conspiracy tards are gonna have fun with this
[01:14:43.760 --> 01:14:44.760]  cuz it doesn't exist.
[01:14:44.760 --> 01:14:49.760]  They had a public policy poll, that's Democratic Party Group, out last week saying, do you
[01:14:49.760 --> 01:15:00.760]  believe in the imaginary new world order? And then like shocking one third believe in
[01:15:00.760 --> 01:15:08.760]  the imaginary new world order. I mean, it's like saying, a third believe in the imaginary
[01:15:08.760 --> 01:15:09.760]  Atlantic Ocean.
[01:15:09.760 --> 01:15:24.760]  I mean, it's like you're informed and you're smart, and people marvel at it. I mean, so
[01:15:24.760 --> 01:15:31.760]  much of why we have a problem in this society is people aren't really stupid. They're ignorant,
[01:15:31.760 --> 01:15:37.760]  and they're lazy, and they don't want to know. I mean, I sit there and people watch. I went
[01:15:37.760 --> 01:15:40.760]  and swam in the river yesterday, and after I was drying off, I watched people for about
[01:15:40.760 --> 01:15:43.760]  ten minutes sitting there drying off before I got in the car.
[01:15:43.760 --> 01:15:48.760]  I shot a video report as well while I was drying off. It's of ants and men is the name
[01:15:48.760 --> 01:15:53.760]  of it. And I watched how insecure men are, big tough looking men and women with their
[01:15:53.760 --> 01:15:58.760]  kids. And just everybody's so scared of what people think of them and how they look, and
[01:15:58.760 --> 01:16:00.760]  it's just such chains.
[01:16:00.760 --> 01:16:05.760]  There's incredible chains on people to where they can laugh at you and go, you believe
[01:16:05.760 --> 01:16:11.760]  in authoritarianism, it doesn't exist. Let's laugh at Charlton Heston, he believed in freedom.
[01:16:11.760 --> 01:16:16.760]  And a normal person, a well-adjusted person, looks at that and says, look at that sophomoric
[01:16:16.760 --> 01:16:22.760]  propaganda. But the propaganda is sophomoric because it's targeting sophomoric arrested
[01:16:22.760 --> 01:16:26.760]  development people.
[01:16:26.760 --> 01:16:31.760]  We had the Secret Service show up here again this morning, and none of the managers were
[01:16:31.760 --> 01:16:35.760]  there. Rob do works for about seven or eight at night, so he gets here at 1030. I was actually
[01:16:35.760 --> 01:16:40.760]  here, I was actually taking a shower, because I went to exercise this morning. I got a shower
[01:16:40.760 --> 01:16:47.760]  back there. And Tim Frugier was over on the other side, so they just told him, yeah, Alex
[01:16:47.760 --> 01:16:48.760]  should be here in ten minutes.
[01:16:48.760 --> 01:16:52.760]  I was actually there about two minutes. And I come back out there because they have a
[01:16:52.760 --> 01:16:58.760]  subpoena for an idiot that went on the Infowars.com comments and said he wanted to go after somebody,
[01:16:58.760 --> 01:17:03.760]  I don't know what yet. And I told people, and I said, they didn't come back in ten minutes,
[01:17:03.760 --> 01:17:07.760]  of course, and they got sheriff deputies driving around the parking lot right now.
[01:17:07.760 --> 01:17:12.760]  And let me tell you how government works. If they can get you to not take a subpoena,
[01:17:12.760 --> 01:17:17.760]  they'll go say we didn't take the subpoena, and then SWAT team us and grab all our computers,
[01:17:17.760 --> 01:17:21.760]  try to shut us down for a while. Now if somebody else up above them will say don't do that,
[01:17:21.760 --> 01:17:23.760]  don't give Alex Jones attention.
[01:17:23.760 --> 01:17:27.760]  See, I'm not worried. I'm not worried, whatever happens to me, I'm trying to do the right
[01:17:27.760 --> 01:17:35.760]  thing for the children, the million plus children that CPS takes every year and rapes and jostling
[01:17:35.760 --> 01:17:40.760]  elders where they teach them how to masturbate. I mean, it's a pervert guilt. I mean, you
[01:17:40.760 --> 01:17:42.760]  think I'm worried about my life?
[01:17:42.760 --> 01:17:47.760]  I know you've got kids pinned down all over the country, raping the daylights out of them
[01:17:47.760 --> 01:17:52.760]  right now. And I feel guilty that I'm not kicking down doors, stopping them right now,
[01:17:52.760 --> 01:17:55.760]  and I just sit here trying to wake people up. You think I care? You think I'm worried
[01:17:55.760 --> 01:18:01.760]  about you? You think I'm like you, a coward, a sack of garbage? You think I'm like you?
[01:18:01.760 --> 01:18:07.760]  I'm not like you. I'm a red-blooded person who is not even near good, but that simply
[01:18:07.760 --> 01:18:09.760]  doesn't wanna hurt innocent people.
[01:18:09.760 --> 01:18:13.760]  You people are a bunch of delusional scum. And I'm gonna tell you something, society
[01:18:13.760 --> 01:18:18.760]  is going to collapse. This country is going to be judged. So you have all your parcel
[01:18:18.760 --> 01:18:22.760]  birth abortions and you shoot your kids up and watch them have convulsions and brain
[01:18:22.760 --> 01:18:27.760]  damage them. This country is run by psycho killer demons, folks. That's all I gotta tell
[01:18:27.760 --> 01:18:30.760]  you. That's all I gotta tell you.
[01:18:30.760 --> 01:18:35.760]  And you know what? I seem crazy to people because I'm awake and I see it. That's why
[01:18:35.760 --> 01:18:39.760]  at first it's just so shocking he yelled at Piers Morgan. We don't need to be like that
[01:18:39.760 --> 01:18:45.760]  and say I know you want my guns because you wanna enslave me. But you notice nobody else
[01:18:45.760 --> 01:18:48.760]  invited me on. You notice everybody else is scared to death.
[01:18:48.760 --> 01:18:52.760]  And I went down and confronted Piers Morgan when he was in Houston, walked in behind the
[01:18:52.760 --> 01:18:56.760]  scenes, there's video of it. And he jumped when he saw me and then later off camera,
[01:18:56.760 --> 01:19:01.760]  his people said, no, no, it was the highest ratings we ever got. It's on record, but we're
[01:19:01.760 --> 01:19:04.760]  not gonna have you back on. We're trying to get you back on.
[01:19:04.760 --> 01:19:09.760]  But Piers and higher ups, this is with the producer in front of my crew, the hires up
[01:19:09.760 --> 01:19:14.760]  just say it's giving you too much attention. Exactly. If I was losing, they would have
[01:19:14.760 --> 01:19:19.760]  me everywhere. I'd be sticking my tongue out on the cover of Time magazine. But ladies
[01:19:19.760 --> 01:19:24.760]  and gentlemen, we're not losing. And we're not winning because we're something special.
[01:19:24.760 --> 01:19:28.760]  We're winning because we've got a pulse and we're not pure evil. That's all you gotta
[01:19:28.760 --> 01:19:34.760]  do is be able to recognize good versus evil. Two plus two equals four. If you can do that,
[01:19:34.760 --> 01:19:40.760]  if you can just recognize the evil running rampant all over the place.
[01:19:40.760 --> 01:19:47.760]  If you can simply recognize that and simply understand that, then everything else falls
[01:19:47.760 --> 01:19:51.760]  into place. But if you can't recognize that we're in deep trouble, you'll never recognize
[01:19:51.760 --> 01:19:56.760]  it as stuff gets worse and worse. You've already said nothing's wrong. So you'll go down with
[01:19:56.760 --> 01:20:00.760]  the ship. You won't even fix the holes in the ship because you're a delusion. Do you
[01:20:00.760 --> 01:20:04.760]  suffer from low functioning adrenal or thyroid gland? Did you know that mercury from your
[01:20:04.760 --> 01:20:08.760]  dental fillings comes off your teeth both as a vapor and as metal particles into your
[01:20:08.760 --> 01:20:12.760]  body? Wherever mercury deposits in your body, it stops cells from functioning normally.
[01:20:12.760 --> 01:20:17.760]  Animal studies show that mercury causes kidney function to drop by 60 percent. Mercury deposited
[01:20:17.760 --> 01:20:21.760]  into your adrenals or thyroid will cause a corresponding drop in function. The number
[01:20:21.760 --> 01:20:25.760]  one method by which your body detoxifies itself of mercury is glutathione. The number one
[01:20:25.760 --> 01:20:30.760]  superfood that helps turn on all 75 trillion cells in your body to produce glutathione
[01:20:30.760 --> 01:20:36.760]  is non-denatured whey protein from grass-fed cows. After investigating most high-end whey
[01:20:36.760 --> 01:20:41.760]  proteins on the market, only one is the most non-denatured, the most active, the most complete,
[01:20:41.760 --> 01:20:45.760]  and in our opinion, the most powerful, in what nature originally put into the fresh

[01:22:29.760 --> 01:22:33.760]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson. Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors
[01:22:33.760 --> 01:22:38.760]  won't talk about gold IRAs? They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry
[01:22:38.760 --> 01:22:42.760]  won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement. Gold is outperformed paper investments,
[01:22:42.760 --> 01:22:49.760]  yet no word about IRAs. If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[01:22:49.760 --> 01:22:55.760]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns, call 800-686-2237. Secure
[01:22:55.760 --> 01:23:03.760]  your future and call 1-800-686-2237.
[01:23:03.760 --> 01:23:09.760]  Curious about what comes next? Next is the feeling of vulnerability you get after you
[01:23:09.760 --> 01:23:14.760]  arrive home to discover your house has been ransacked by burglars. Fool the bad guys with
[01:23:14.760 --> 01:23:20.760]  a new improved fake TV. You asked for it, we listened, and we made our new fake TV three
[01:23:20.760 --> 01:23:25.760]  times brighter than our previous model. The brightness of our new fake TV is equivalent
[01:23:25.760 --> 01:23:31.760]  to a 40-inch TV. It simulates the color and motion of a real TV while you're away from
[01:23:31.760 --> 01:23:36.760]  home. And when burglars think someone is home watching television, they're likely to pass
[01:23:36.760 --> 01:23:42.760]  your house and move on to an easier target. The new, brighter fake TV is only $39.95 and
[01:23:42.760 --> 01:23:53.760]  includes free shipping. Go to faketv.com or call 1-877-5FAKETV. That's 877-532-5388. Or
[01:23:53.760 --> 01:24:17.760]  go to faketv.com. Fake TV, the burglar deterrent.
[01:24:17.760 --> 01:24:31.760]  Right now, in Egypt, in Libya, in Syria, NATO, CENTCOM, U.S. military forces are arming and
[01:24:31.760 --> 01:24:38.760]  trading Al Qaeda who are blowing up and burning churches as we speak. New videos every day
[01:24:38.760 --> 01:24:43.760]  of Christian families begging as their heads are chopped off, as mosques are burned to
[01:24:43.760 --> 01:24:49.760]  the ground, and Al Qaeda has given U.S. satellite data to carry out the operations.
[01:24:49.760 --> 01:24:56.760]  Now, see, I guess that is spooky what I just said. It's true because our government is
[01:24:56.760 --> 01:25:01.760]  gone, ladies and gentlemen. It's totally taken over by foreign mega banks that are completely
[01:25:01.760 --> 01:25:11.760]  disconnected from reality and get away with anything they want. And China's pure evil,
[01:25:11.760 --> 01:25:21.760]  Russia's pure evil, it's all evil. Having a country not completely run by evil is
[01:25:21.760 --> 01:25:30.760]  extremely rare. I got the famous basketball player Mike Glenn known as The Stinger coming
[01:25:30.760 --> 01:25:33.760]  on, really interesting guy, so I wanted to get him on and talk about a host of issues.
[01:25:33.760 --> 01:25:42.760]  Antonio Buehler. Buehler is gonna be in studio with us. Yep, Austin says you can't film police,
[01:25:42.760 --> 01:25:46.760]  you'll be indicted. They spin it and say, well, he was interfering with the police.
[01:25:46.760 --> 01:25:54.760]  Yeah, they run over and start grabbing on his camera. And so they've had a grand jury
[01:25:54.760 --> 01:26:02.760]  and die him. And they tried to tell me three weeks ago we couldn't hand out magazines
[01:26:02.760 --> 01:26:09.760]  in Austin. I don't have to drive far now to see National Guard running checkpoints at
[01:26:09.760 --> 01:26:10.760]  traffic control in Austin.
[01:26:10.760 --> 01:26:16.760]  I don't have to go far to find TSA doing checkpoints, searching bags and cars without warrants.
[01:26:16.760 --> 01:26:22.760]  I can just go like two miles from here. Told you it was coming 12 years ago, but now I
[01:26:22.760 --> 01:26:27.760]  can just go down and show you. And then I know what else is gonna come. And then the
[01:26:27.760 --> 01:26:32.760]  weird Enviro inspectors with their badges, the little green uniforms and badges, are
[01:26:32.760 --> 01:26:34.760]  gonna order their way into my home.
[01:26:34.760 --> 01:26:44.760]  And if I tell them they can't come, well, they'll just come with a SWAT team and kill
[01:26:44.760 --> 01:26:51.760]  me. Cuz they're the good guys. Now they get on the news and tell me my kids belong to
[01:26:51.760 --> 01:26:56.760]  them. I knew their textbooks have said that forever, but now they're just openly saying
[01:26:56.760 --> 01:27:00.760]  it. And the yuppies will just go whenever they think it's popular.
[01:27:00.760 --> 01:27:06.760]  The state runs kids? Well, here's my kids. You'll arrest me if I don't take shots? There's
[01:27:06.760 --> 01:27:11.760]  no law? But even if there was a law, it'd be unconstitutional. Okay, fine. Lie to me
[01:27:11.760 --> 01:27:16.760]  and say it's the law, I gotta take shots. I mean, it's criminals have gotten away with
[01:27:16.760 --> 01:27:19.760]  everything and now they're gonna take your pension fund.
[01:27:19.760 --> 01:27:24.760]  By the way, that's being announced that they're gonna take rich people's pension funds of
[01:27:24.760 --> 01:27:28.760]  after tax money, only the rich people of course. And when they're done, they'll get your money
[01:27:28.760 --> 01:27:37.760]  too. This is the season of the takeover though. 100 plus million people out of work, 50 million
[01:27:37.760 --> 01:27:42.760]  on food stamps, and that number's gonna just increase until they got everybody on the dole.
[01:27:42.760 --> 01:27:45.760]  You'll either work for the government, or you'll be a bureaucrat with the government,
[01:27:45.760 --> 01:27:50.760]  or you'll work for a corporation that's fed by the government, or you'll be on welfare.
[01:27:50.760 --> 01:27:56.760]  And who do they demonize in all the homeland security and FEMA training manuals? Conservative,
[01:27:56.760 --> 01:28:02.760]  libertarian, returning veterans, gun owners, Christians. It says evangelical Christians,
[01:28:02.760 --> 01:28:08.760]  Christian Catholics, period, you're with Al-Qaeda, Fox News.
[01:28:08.760 --> 01:28:16.760]  While I was sent from Phoenix in 1999, a famous FBI training manual for police and it said,
[01:28:16.760 --> 01:28:21.760]  those that believe in the Constitution, those that call themselves constitutionalist, or
[01:28:21.760 --> 01:28:28.760]  make frequent references to the Constitution, they are terrorists. And if you see someone
[01:28:28.760 --> 01:28:30.760]  talking like that, call the FBI.
[01:28:30.760 --> 01:28:35.760]  And you can turn on now the sitcoms and dramas, and every show, if somebody talks about their
[01:28:35.760 --> 01:28:41.760]  rights, everybody laughs at them and points. And the public is so peer pressure driven,
[01:28:41.760 --> 01:28:47.760]  well, I better not, someone will laugh at me. That's the end of the world. You shouldn't
[01:28:47.760 --> 01:28:52.760]  fear cowardly jellyfish who don't have their own opinion because they're so dumbed down,
[01:28:52.760 --> 01:28:53.760]  them laughing at you.
[01:28:53.760 --> 01:29:00.760]  It's like having a, do you get mad when a squirrel taunts you and barks at you and laughs
[01:29:00.760 --> 01:29:05.760]  at you? Squirrels do that, they actually kind of have their own laugh. I mean, do you get
[01:29:05.760 --> 01:29:09.760]  mad when a squirrel? No, it's a squirrel, who cares about it? I mean, do you care when
[01:29:09.760 --> 01:29:13.760]  some victim? It'd be like if you had some mentally ill victim laughing at you on the
[01:29:13.760 --> 01:29:18.760]  side of the street corner, you see schizophrenics talking to themselves, laughing. Like, don't
[01:29:18.760 --> 01:29:23.760]  laugh at me, you're schizophrenic. I feel bad, you're laughing at me.
[01:29:23.760 --> 01:29:29.760]  And that's what it is. I mean, you've got mentally ill people trained to accept total
[01:29:29.760 --> 01:29:36.760]  tyranny. And then if they laugh at you, I mean, I heard callers on the radio going,
[01:29:36.760 --> 01:29:42.760]  aha, you Republicans are mad, we got Obamacare. Aha, and they laugh like their team's winning.
[01:29:42.760 --> 01:29:46.760]  It's like a football game when the Republicans wrote the Obamacare.
[01:29:46.760 --> 01:29:56.760]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:56.760 --> 01:30:05.760]  You prepare by purchasing gold, food and firearms. But if you don't have a home security system,
[01:30:05.760 --> 01:30:10.760]  then you're missing a critical weapon in your arsenal for home protection. When you're

[01:30:59.760 --> 01:31:05.760]  In the last two years alone, the U.S. has seen huge losses to our food supply. In 2011,
[01:31:05.760 --> 01:31:10.760]  storms and floods raged across the U.S., costing us $20 billion in lost crops alone. In 2012,
[01:31:10.760 --> 01:31:14.760]  we saw the largest drought in the country in more than 50 years. You may think out of
[01:31:14.760 --> 01:31:19.760]  sight, out of mind, and so you don't think you will be affected. The fact is, you are.
[01:31:19.760 --> 01:31:24.760]  We all are. Food shortages drive prices up for everyone. You might not be able to control

[01:32:00.760 --> 01:32:04.760]  I had tried everything. I'd cut back the amount of food I was eating. I was lifting weights
[01:32:04.760 --> 01:32:09.760]  and jogging, but nothing was working. My body was literally starving for minerals and trace
[01:32:09.760 --> 01:32:15.760]  elements as well as key vitamins. And as soon as I had that, I immediately could eat half
[01:32:15.760 --> 01:32:20.760]  of what I was eating previously and be satisfied. Now there are hundreds of great products at
[01:32:20.760 --> 01:32:26.760]  info wars team dot com, but I want to point out the three that have helped me lose 37
[01:32:26.760 --> 01:32:34.760]  pounds in just two months. Products like Beyond Tangy Tangerine, Holland Burst and Rebound.
[01:32:34.760 --> 01:32:38.760]  When I started taking the Tangy Tangerine and other products every day, I lost more
[01:32:38.760 --> 01:32:44.760]  than 37 pounds in just two months. Now that's results. I want to challenge my listeners
[01:32:44.760 --> 01:32:49.760]  to go to info wars team dot com and to order just three of their products. And you will
[01:32:49.760 --> 01:32:54.760]  see the changes in the way you look, feel and in your appetite almost immediately. Start

[01:33:02.760 --> 01:33:08.760]  We now take you live to the Central Texas command center in the heart of the resistance.
[01:33:08.760 --> 01:33:18.760]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show. Well, Dan Bongino is a now retired senior
[01:33:18.760 --> 01:33:23.760]  Secret Service agent that led details all over the world with Obama and others. And
[01:33:23.760 --> 01:33:27.760]  he's going to be joining us. He's a pro Second Amendment guy. There's also a funny conspiracy
[01:33:27.760 --> 01:33:32.760]  about him out there on the Internet. So we'll we'll be we'll be talking. We were just laughing
[01:33:32.760 --> 01:33:36.760]  during the break talking about it. So we're gonna be talking to him here in just a moment.
[01:33:36.760 --> 01:33:40.760]  First off, ladies and gentlemen, I want to encourage all of you to remember the show
[01:33:40.760 --> 01:33:44.760]  is growing by leaps and bounds because you are spreading the word and we're here defending
[01:33:44.760 --> 01:33:50.760]  the Bill of Rights, the Constitution. When you buy propure water filters with 10 percent
[01:33:50.760 --> 01:33:54.760]  off of promo code water, you don't just get a great water filter at the lowest price.
[01:33:54.760 --> 01:34:02.760]  You also. Reaching over here to get my survival seed vault, you also save a ton of money and
[01:34:02.760 --> 01:34:06.760]  we also have the lowest price out there on the survival seed vault. Great way to start
[01:34:06.760 --> 01:34:10.760]  your garden, your summer garden, your fall garden. Little late to the spring garden.
[01:34:10.760 --> 01:34:15.760]  This is one of the best products out there. But we're carrying a whole line of seeds that
[01:34:15.760 --> 01:34:19.760]  for a year we've been investigating, looking at six different great products right now
[01:34:19.760 --> 01:34:24.760]  in Infowars store dot com. And when you go to Infowars store dot com and shop with the
[01:34:24.760 --> 01:34:29.760]  good guys, that allows me to hire reporters, video editors to make more films, do the nightly
[01:34:29.760 --> 01:34:32.760]  news, to have more researchers for the radio show.
[01:34:32.760 --> 01:34:37.760]  So again, ladies and gentlemen, you can also support the broadcast with Operation Sleeping
[01:34:37.760 --> 01:34:42.760]  Giant, where you can get a membership for $5.95 a month to see the nightly news, the

[01:35:03.760 --> 01:35:08.760]  and so much more. Great way to wake people up and support our operation and pay for the
[01:35:08.760 --> 01:35:14.760]  bandwidth. Prison planet dot TV. And yes, this is the best deal we've got of all the
[01:35:14.760 --> 01:35:20.760]  seeds on the site. Survival seed vault, garden in a can. It is just thousands and thousands
[01:35:20.760 --> 01:35:27.760]  of seeds, just a massive variety of non GMO, non hybrids. So they produce their own seeds
[01:35:27.760 --> 01:35:32.760]  later as you can replant. It's all there. Check it out. Infowars store dot com. Or if
[01:35:32.760 --> 01:35:38.760]  you have questions or want to order via the phone, 888-253-3139.
[01:35:38.760 --> 01:35:45.760]  Now, I think it's best to introduce our guest this way. This is our guest who recently retired
[01:35:45.760 --> 01:35:52.760]  to go into the private sector from the Secret Service, Dan Bongino, talking about the Second
[01:35:52.760 --> 01:35:58.760]  Amendment, extremely impassioned defense of our most basic of rights.
[01:35:58.760 --> 01:36:05.760]  That flag represents something. Men and women have died horrible deaths. Horrible deaths,
[01:36:05.760 --> 01:36:11.760]  my uncle being one of them. Shot in the back in Vietnam to protect your very right. We
[01:36:11.760 --> 01:36:18.760]  live in a society of wolves. You do not fight back by creating more sheep.
[01:36:18.760 --> 01:36:23.760]  Our next guest says there is no such thing as gun control, only people control. You just
[01:36:23.760 --> 01:36:27.760]  saw him giving a passionate speech at a rally in Maryland. Joining us now is former Secret
[01:36:27.760 --> 01:36:32.760]  Service agent Dan Bongino. Dan, thanks a lot for joining us. What do you mean there's no
[01:36:32.760 --> 01:36:36.760]  such thing as gun control, only people control? Tell me what that means.
[01:36:36.760 --> 01:36:41.760]  Tucker, this is part of your ideological ploy by this administration. They're not being
[01:36:41.760 --> 01:36:45.760]  authentic with America, whether it's the sequester healthcare or the gun control issue. What
[01:36:45.760 --> 01:36:50.760]  they do is they manipulate an emotional crisis, a national emotional crisis, to further an
[01:36:50.760 --> 01:36:57.760]  ideological agenda, which involves the evaporation, the slow disintegration of your civil rights,
[01:36:57.760 --> 01:37:02.760]  your liberties, your ability to live and let live. And it's a disturbing pattern that,
[01:37:02.760 --> 01:37:05.760]  frankly, is really starting to get under my skin.
[01:37:05.760 --> 01:37:11.760]  All right, there you go, and it's under my skin. Dan Bongino joins us. And again, I saw
[01:37:11.760 --> 01:37:16.760]  this clip a while back and said that's the type of Secret Service or people in government
[01:37:16.760 --> 01:37:23.760]  period we need. That's founding father type statements we're hearing. Bongino.com is his
[01:37:23.760 --> 01:37:29.760]  website. He's now left the Secret Service happily to start his own private high profile
[01:37:29.760 --> 01:37:37.760]  client list dealing with crisis and assessment mitigation. And he, again, graduated with
[01:37:37.760 --> 01:37:43.760]  honors out of the Secret Service Academy back in 99. He's run high profile operations all
[01:37:43.760 --> 01:37:49.760]  over the world with the POTUS, and so he's a senior guy when he left. And we're excited
[01:37:49.760 --> 01:37:54.760]  to have him on with us. And it's good to see people out there defending the Second Amendment
[01:37:54.760 --> 01:37:56.760]  so eloquently. So Dan, good to have you on with us.
[01:37:56.760 --> 01:37:59.760]  Great to be here. Thanks for having me.
[01:37:59.760 --> 01:38:05.760]  Wow. So much is going on in the world. What do you make of now the move to have some of
[01:38:05.760 --> 01:38:11.760]  the victims of the parents on Air Force One with Obama of Sandy Hook?
[01:38:11.760 --> 01:38:16.760]  Well, listen, these are unfortunately, you know, these parents were subject to an unspeakable
[01:38:16.760 --> 01:38:20.760]  tragedy. I think everybody's life changed. Everybody knows where they were when they
[01:38:20.760 --> 01:38:26.760]  heard about these events in Sandy Hook. I know I was actually driving to a funeral for
[01:38:26.760 --> 01:38:31.760]  a family member, which just compounded my misery. But, you know, Alex, guns don't have
[01:38:31.760 --> 01:38:36.760]  rights, you know, people do. And that's one thing that's been lost in this. You know,
[01:38:36.760 --> 01:38:42.760]  this is not about gun control. He's manipulating those folks and using them as political props
[01:38:42.760 --> 01:38:48.760]  to further an agenda that really has nothing to do, unfortunately, and I mean that, with
[01:38:48.760 --> 01:38:54.760]  actually preventing events similar to that from happening again, there are ways to stop
[01:38:54.760 --> 01:38:59.760]  any Sandy Hooks from happening in the future. But the president's really not interested
[01:38:59.760 --> 01:39:02.760]  in those. He's interested in political games, and that's what he's doing right now.
[01:39:02.760 --> 01:39:05.760]  And that's why I wanted to get you on the Secret Service, probably the leading experts
[01:39:05.760 --> 01:39:11.760]  worldwide in protecting a high profile individual like the president that could have governments,
[01:39:11.760 --> 01:39:17.760]  terrorists, you name it, wanting to target them. What would you do as an expert to protect
[01:39:17.760 --> 01:39:18.760]  the schools?
[01:39:18.760 --> 01:39:22.760]  Right. You know, what's good for the goose is not good for the gander at these situations.
[01:39:22.760 --> 01:39:27.760]  You know, what model of security that you know of, what model of security involved,
[01:39:27.760 --> 01:39:33.760]  you know, unarmed security and all these kind of nonsensical measures, gun-free zones. How
[01:39:33.760 --> 01:39:36.760]  come we don't do that when I was a Secret Service agent around the president? Well,
[01:39:36.760 --> 01:39:40.760]  you know, we don't need guns here, folks. We're just going to declare a gun-free zone
[01:39:40.760 --> 01:39:44.760]  360 degrees around the president and walk around. If I were to say that, your listeners
[01:39:44.760 --> 01:39:48.760]  right now are probably laughing, like that's ridiculous. Of course, but it's not ridiculous
[01:39:48.760 --> 01:39:53.760]  when it comes to your kids. I mean, that's exactly, I just described to you exactly the
[01:39:53.760 --> 01:39:58.760]  security situation that your benevolent class of politicians, these so-called angels, and
[01:39:58.760 --> 01:40:02.760]  I use air quotes there, are prescribing for your children. No system that defends their
[01:40:02.760 --> 01:40:08.760]  kids, by the way, just yours. Now, you have things, armed school security, man traps,
[01:40:08.760 --> 01:40:12.760]  which we have situations where you can put, they call it a man trap, a door that won't
[01:40:12.760 --> 01:40:16.760]  open until another door closes one person at a time at school. You have things like
[01:40:16.760 --> 01:40:20.760]  entering mental health records into nicks. Now, I'm a libertarian, so I'm always careful
[01:40:20.760 --> 01:40:24.760]  with that, but mental health records that have been vetted through some judicial review,
[01:40:24.760 --> 01:40:28.760]  entering them into nicks, which is the gun check background system. You have harsh penalties
[01:40:28.760 --> 01:40:33.760]  for criminals who misuse firearms. I mean, there are real things that have worked. None
[01:40:33.760 --> 01:40:37.760]  of them are in this legislation at all. This is, again, guns don't have rights. People
[01:40:37.760 --> 01:40:41.760]  do. They are taking away your rights. There's nothing to do with guns at all. This is a
[01:40:41.760 --> 01:40:47.760]  simple political ploy to get you all to applaud while your civil liberties continue to dissipate
[01:40:47.760 --> 01:40:51.760]  like an Alka-Seltzer tablet, a bad drink of water.
[01:40:51.760 --> 01:40:58.760]  Well, expanding on that, we have the FBI crime statistics that are the model of statistics
[01:40:58.760 --> 01:41:02.760]  worldwide, because so many statistics are bogus, but these are 80 years old, where they
[01:41:02.760 --> 01:41:09.760]  collect them from thousands of jurisdictions. And 49% drop in violent crime since 1991,
[01:41:09.760 --> 01:41:14.760]  and they directly draw the line to the proliferation of the Second Amendment. And the fact that
[01:41:14.760 --> 01:41:19.760]  criminals are scared in places like Texas or Arizona to break in somebody's house because
[01:41:19.760 --> 01:41:20.760]  they know there's a gun on the other side.
[01:41:20.760 --> 01:41:24.760]  But in Chicago or New York, where they've disarmed the people, the crime rates are the
[01:41:24.760 --> 01:41:30.760]  highest in the world. In Chicago, even worse than Mexico, the murder capital is a country.
[01:41:30.760 --> 01:41:35.760]  I mean, the proof is right there. My own police chief here in Austin says, hey, you shouldn't
[01:41:35.760 --> 01:41:39.760]  have high-capacity mags, and you're with the criminals if you do that. Well, criminals
[01:41:39.760 --> 01:41:45.760]  are gonna have high-capacity mags regardless. And so, well, what do you say to those numbers?
[01:41:45.760 --> 01:41:51.760]  Right. Well, I can give you an on-the-ground example of this. I was a police officer with
[01:41:51.760 --> 01:41:55.760]  the NYPD and a Secret Service agent for a combined 16 years, 12 in the Secret Service
[01:41:55.760 --> 01:42:01.760]  with the NYPD. Alex, I never, ever arrested a criminal or investigated a criminal or,
[01:42:01.760 --> 01:42:05.760]  frankly, heard of an agent or a cop who was investigated or arrested, someone who had
[01:42:05.760 --> 01:42:11.760]  a gun legally. I'm not saying legal gun owners occasionally are not involved in crimes. But
[01:42:11.760 --> 01:42:16.760]  the thing is, it's so exceedingly rare that to forfeit away your civil liberties for a
[01:42:16.760 --> 01:42:22.760]  group of folks, legal gun owners, that are not the problem seems to me like an obvious
[01:42:22.760 --> 01:42:29.760]  scam. It's a scam. You know, they're called lawbreakers for a reason. Alex, they don't
[01:42:29.760 --> 01:42:34.760]  give a damn, pardon my language, about the law. They don't care. They are not interested
[01:42:34.760 --> 01:42:38.760]  in your magazine limit. As a matter of fact, you don't determine the amount of ammunition,
[01:42:38.760 --> 01:42:43.760]  amount of rounds you need in your firearm to defend yourself in a gunfight. Not you,
[01:42:43.760 --> 01:42:48.760]  not a bureaucrat. The bad guy attacking you does. When he stops shooting, then you're
[01:42:48.760 --> 01:42:55.760]  done too. Nobody, they have a bureaucrat like a Dianne Feinstein, so disingenuously, who's
[01:42:55.760 --> 01:42:59.760]  defended by men with guns, by the way, claim that if you're a talented shooter, whatever
[01:42:59.760 --> 01:43:06.760]  her ridiculous words were, you only need less than 10 rounds. It's so ridiculous that to
[01:43:06.760 --> 01:43:11.760]  any common sense thinking individual, you would almost laugh hysterically if you could
[01:43:11.760 --> 01:43:16.760]  evaluate this outside of the emotions attached to the issue. This is only going to impact
[01:43:16.760 --> 01:43:22.760]  law-abiding gun owners who have done absolutely nothing wrong. They just want to live and
[01:43:22.760 --> 01:43:28.760]  be left alone by a government just absolutely obsessed with a further encroachment on your
[01:43:28.760 --> 01:43:29.760]  civil right.
[01:43:29.760 --> 01:43:38.760]  It's amazing. And then you see Bloomberg, who has up to 15 people on his quote security
[01:43:38.760 --> 01:43:43.760]  detail, and then they'll even rough people up, cameramen that come up and ask him questions.
[01:43:43.760 --> 01:43:49.760]  I mean, it's clear the government wants to have the monopoly of guns, just like the greatest
[01:43:49.760 --> 01:43:53.760]  mass murderer in history said, political power goes out of the barrel of a gun. Mao Zedong
[01:43:53.760 --> 01:43:58.760]  wasn't for government gun control. What do you make, and again, he was a senior secret
[01:43:58.760 --> 01:44:05.760]  service agent when he retired to go into private security practice. Dan Bongino joins us. What
[01:44:05.760 --> 01:44:10.760]  made you leave the secret service and decide to go into the private sector?
[01:44:10.760 --> 01:44:15.760]  Well, I resigned. I wish I had retired. I would have been able to keep my health benefits
[01:44:15.760 --> 01:44:22.760]  and pension and all of that. My wife and I took an enormous financial hit. You know,
[01:44:22.760 --> 01:44:27.760]  Alex, there comes a point in your life where you have to determine. My father said to me
[01:44:27.760 --> 01:44:31.760]  when I was younger, fight the good fight. And I said, well, what's the good fight?
[01:44:31.760 --> 01:44:36.760]  He said, well, that's for you to determine. And he got that from two Timothy 4-7. I fought
[01:44:36.760 --> 01:44:42.760]  the good fight. I ran the race. I've kept the faith. I knew my good fight was this one.
[01:44:42.760 --> 01:44:47.760]  Our ideological battle and our generation is not what we went through in the Civil War,
[01:44:47.760 --> 01:44:52.760]  you know, defending the country and abolishing the scourge of slavery. It's not our revolution
[01:44:52.760 --> 01:44:57.760]  where we fought for the very ideas of limited government freedom. That's not it. But we're
[01:44:57.760 --> 01:45:02.760]  fighting now with an ideology, a pernicious, dangerous, and historically deadly ideology
[01:45:02.760 --> 01:45:09.760]  that says that other men and women have been imbued with some special powers to reign over
[01:45:09.760 --> 01:45:14.760]  your life and take your liberty and to move forward. And this is somehow a benevolent
[01:45:14.760 --> 01:45:19.760]  way, knighted by the Lord himself, that these men should take control of your life. This
[01:45:19.760 --> 01:45:23.760]  is our fight. This is our time. I left because I knew that was my fight. And I knew with
[01:45:23.760 --> 01:45:28.760]  the Hatch Act and it would be unfair and it would be disingenuous to sit there and have
[01:45:28.760 --> 01:45:32.760]  to listen to any more of these speeches. And I would have died for the President of the
[01:45:32.760 --> 01:45:36.760]  United States no matter what. It's not a political thing. We're not a banana republic
[01:45:36.760 --> 01:45:41.760]  here. We're not a third world country. We do our damage at the voting booth. But I couldn't
[01:45:41.760 --> 01:45:46.760]  contribute to this anymore. You were either in this fight or you were not, folks. And
[01:45:46.760 --> 01:45:51.760]  if you are not, you are going to rue the day that you let this happen and know that today
[01:45:51.760 --> 01:45:55.760]  is the best it was ever going to be, that your children had less than you have and have
[01:45:55.760 --> 01:46:00.760]  no American dream because you refused to get in this fight. This is it. Right now, you're
[01:46:00.760 --> 01:46:03.760]  at the event horizon. Action matters.
[01:46:03.760 --> 01:46:07.760]  Wow, I like this, what you're saying. You're absolutely right. We're at the crossroads.
[01:46:07.760 --> 01:46:12.760]  Now, the future of this country has been set. Have you seen the video that started airing
[01:46:12.760 --> 01:46:19.760]  as a promo last week? Our MSNBC host, in fact, cue that up, guys. MSNBC host says your kids
[01:46:19.760 --> 01:46:22.760]  belong to the collective. Have you seen that?
[01:46:22.760 --> 01:46:26.760]  I've heard of it. I didn't see the video, but I know exactly what you're speaking. I
[01:46:26.760 --> 01:46:29.760]  was afraid to watch it for obvious reasons.
[01:46:29.760 --> 01:46:35.760]  But I mean, it's so over the top how authoritarian and the Democrats have become because I'm
[01:46:35.760 --> 01:46:39.760]  not even a Republican. I'm more of a constitutional libertarian. I mean, these people, I've read
[01:46:39.760 --> 01:46:44.760]  a lot of history books. I mean, these people are really creepy. And I'm having to argue
[01:46:44.760 --> 01:46:47.760]  with my wife, who's got a degree in French and history.
[01:46:47.760 --> 01:46:51.760]  She's wanting to get out of the US. And I respect the fact that, obviously, you left
[01:46:51.760 --> 01:46:55.760]  the Secret Service. You can run for office and try to fight this. We should talk about
[01:46:55.760 --> 01:47:01.760]  that. But I mean, it's just the creepy meter is broken. It's off the chart here with all
[01:47:01.760 --> 01:47:03.760]  the weirdness of these people.
[01:47:03.760 --> 01:47:08.760]  Right, and don't you see what they're doing, folks? They're leveraging, they're not crisis
[01:47:08.760 --> 01:47:14.760]  managing, they're crisis leveraging. They're using a national emotional crisis to get you
[01:47:14.760 --> 01:47:17.760]  to believe things that simply aren't true.
[01:47:17.760 --> 01:47:24.760]  Why is this country different than any country in the history of mankind? Why are we the
[01:47:24.760 --> 01:47:29.760]  most prosperous? Why is today, right now, the most prosperous human beings have ever
[01:47:29.760 --> 01:47:34.760]  had it in this place at this time? Because we were unique. We developed, unique, that's
[01:47:34.760 --> 01:47:40.760]  an overused word, not in this case. Men sat down and developed that piece of paper, that
[01:47:40.760 --> 01:47:45.760]  Constitution, which, for the first time in human history, decide that won in a battle,
[01:47:45.760 --> 01:47:51.760]  decided not to take more power, but to limit their power. They realized that the real power
[01:47:51.760 --> 01:47:55.760]  was in the hearts of individual men, not of government ruling over them.
[01:47:55.760 --> 01:48:00.760]  It was such a unique situation. It was unheard of that we had won this revolution, and the
[01:48:00.760 --> 01:48:06.760]  men who had led it didn't draw up a constitution that made them monarchs and kings and aristocrats.
[01:48:06.760 --> 01:48:11.760]  It made them civil servants. It made them servants to the people. That's what-
[01:48:11.760 --> 01:48:14.760]  They tried to make George Washington the king, and he got really angry.
[01:48:14.760 --> 01:48:18.760]  Right, he left. What is it that King George said after he stepped down after his second
[01:48:18.760 --> 01:48:21.760]  term, although he could have ran, and you and I know this house, he could have ran four
[01:48:21.760 --> 01:48:25.760]  more times and won each time. He said, if this is true, he must be the greatest man
[01:48:25.760 --> 01:48:31.760]  who ever lived. These men understood the danger of losing your liberty, your real liberty,
[01:48:31.760 --> 01:48:35.760]  something you can put teeth in, your economic liberty, your money, your healthcare liberty.
[01:48:35.760 --> 01:48:40.760]  Well, look, they demonize America all day, looking at our problems, but if you look at
[01:48:40.760 --> 01:48:46.760]  other cultures, it's been the best. And liberty created so much wealth that now a bunch of
[01:48:46.760 --> 01:48:51.760]  spoiled brat collectivists who don't dream of building their own world, their own creation,
[01:48:51.760 --> 01:48:55.760]  they dream of making us be their slaves. And so the bigger the government gets, the more
[01:48:55.760 --> 01:49:03.760]  power they have. Let's play the clip of the MSNBC host in a promo, Melissa Harris-Perry,
[01:49:03.760 --> 01:49:08.760]  saying your kids belong to the collective, and folks, they mean to the state. Here it is.
[01:49:08.760 --> 01:49:13.760]  We have never invested as much in public education as we should have because we've always had
[01:49:13.760 --> 01:49:19.760]  kind of a private notion of children. Your kid is yours and totally your responsibility.
[01:49:19.760 --> 01:49:23.760]  We haven't had a very collective notion of these are our children. So part of it is we
[01:49:23.760 --> 01:49:27.760]  have to break through our kind of private idea that kids belong to their parents or
[01:49:27.760 --> 01:49:31.760]  kids belong to their families and recognize that kids belong to whole communities. Once
[01:49:31.760 --> 01:49:35.760]  it's everybody's responsibility and not just the households, then we start making better
[01:49:35.760 --> 01:49:42.760]  investments. Dan, what'd you make of that? What human being on the planet? The real question
[01:49:42.760 --> 01:49:46.760]  for any of your listeners who may be on the other side of the political fence. What human
[01:49:46.760 --> 01:49:52.760]  being on the planet cares about your children more than you do? What? The answer is none.
[01:49:52.760 --> 01:49:59.760]  There is no way that is true. There is no collective. There are groups of human beings
[01:49:59.760 --> 01:50:03.760]  who live in this land at this time right now under this governing system. Alex, there is
[01:50:03.760 --> 01:50:08.760]  no collective. There's no collective mind. There's no collective money. It's individual
[01:50:08.760 --> 01:50:14.760]  money taken by people. There is no collective heart or mind that cares about your kids either.
[01:50:14.760 --> 01:50:20.760]  Well, statistically, the government is five to seven times more likely to abuse children
[01:50:20.760 --> 01:50:24.760]  than any other group. That's the Justice Department's own numbers. I mean, this is the worst group
[01:50:24.760 --> 01:50:28.760]  to give kids to. Look at North Korea. Look at Nazi Germany. I know you know all this.
[01:50:28.760 --> 01:50:32.760]  I want to come back and talk about how we take this country back and what you're doing
[01:50:32.760 --> 01:50:37.760]  over there on your website. Very, very interesting site. We'll give that address out to all of
[01:50:37.760 --> 01:50:43.760]  the viewers and the listeners. Bongino dot com. Very exciting to see libertarian
[01:50:43.760 --> 01:50:49.760]  constitutionalists like yourself out there speaking out and running for office.
[01:50:49.760 --> 01:50:53.760]  We're going to come back and talk about what you're doing and where you see this this political
[01:50:53.760 --> 01:51:17.760]  fight going straight ahead. On the other side, I'm Alex Jones and Paul Ward's dot com.

[01:52:53.760 --> 01:52:59.760]  We'll be right back.

[01:53:35.760 --> 01:53:41.760]  But rather, we have formulated our silver gel using the natural skin nourishing chemistry of aloe vera
[01:53:41.760 --> 01:53:47.760]  to quickly penetrate and nourish the skin while delivering the silver more effectively.

[01:54:09.760 --> 01:54:17.760]  Was an inside job. Just like it always is. Dan Bongino has got a big announcement tomorrow.
[01:54:17.760 --> 01:54:24.760]  I know what it is, but you can just we'll tell you about it tomorrow. State right run in Maryland.
[01:54:24.760 --> 01:54:30.760]  Well, they shouldn't need it. They're trying to take the guns there right now. I was asking you during the break
[01:54:30.760 --> 01:54:34.760]  about your philosophy and when it all clicked for you. And that was pretty powerful.
[01:54:34.760 --> 01:54:40.760]  Please repeat that, Dan. Well, I was I was sad when it all really punched me in the gut.
[01:54:40.760 --> 01:54:46.760]  I was at the USC campus listening to a speech by the president and I just watched this.
[01:54:46.760 --> 01:54:54.760]  All the 18 and 22 year old kids just sat there and just endless rounds of applause over these just old,
[01:54:54.760 --> 01:55:01.760]  you know, formally, you know, deadly, historically ideas that were just being regurgitated in such flowery words.
[01:55:01.760 --> 01:55:06.760]  And I just could not believe it. You know, I say it almost half jokingly,
[01:55:06.760 --> 01:55:11.760]  but not that it was one of those Star Wars films where the Natalie Portman character says,
[01:55:11.760 --> 01:55:15.760]  here it is, that all collapses to thunderous rounds of applause.
[01:55:15.760 --> 01:55:22.760]  Yeah, this is how Liberty dies. You know, not with people booing it, but with thundering applause.
[01:55:22.760 --> 01:55:28.760]  And you're sitting there. You described it as he promotes total collectivism and the kids are soaking it in your spirit.
[01:55:28.760 --> 01:55:32.760]  I made a decision right there to break with it. Yeah, I couldn't take it.
[01:55:32.760 --> 01:55:38.760]  And I knew it was going to be just a devastating financial decision and hardship on my on my wife and I.
[01:55:38.760 --> 01:55:46.760]  But in order to avoid just embarrassing the White House completely and leaving there, I fulfill my assignment.
[01:55:46.760 --> 01:55:49.760]  I waited a couple of months to not make up because I really wanted it.
[01:55:49.760 --> 01:55:54.760]  I did not want it to be a distraction for my real messenger. And I just walked away.
[01:55:54.760 --> 01:55:59.760]  And I remember my boss being just stunned. But that was it. That was the moment I went back to my, you know, family.
[01:55:59.760 --> 01:56:06.760]  And I said, Paula, you know, I can't do this anymore. I mean, you if you are not doing something, action matters.
[01:56:06.760 --> 01:56:12.760]  You are not part of the problem. You're the problem. You are allowing this to happen.
[01:56:12.760 --> 01:56:18.760]  This whole, oh, I give up. You know, we've lost a few political fights. You don't get to give up, folks.
[01:56:18.760 --> 01:56:22.760]  It's not a golf game. You can't walk off the golf course. The president's not.
[01:56:22.760 --> 01:56:28.760]  This is a boxing match. When you stop punching, I got news for you. The other guy's hitting you harder.
[01:56:28.760 --> 01:56:34.760]  You don't have a choice. This is your. That's right. People think, oh, it's work to fight evil folks.
[01:56:34.760 --> 01:56:39.760]  A total authoritarianism is taking over. OK, that's the way it always works. They're not going to give up.
[01:56:39.760 --> 01:56:45.760]  And if we just stood up, we'd beat them. That's why it's very exciting that you're going to run for statewide office in Maryland.
[01:56:45.760 --> 01:56:52.760]  And do you have children? I have two daughters. Yeah. Well, I have two daughters and a son.
[01:56:52.760 --> 01:56:56.760]  And let me tell you, it's beyond anger. It's beyond disgust. It's love.
[01:56:56.760 --> 01:57:05.760]  But the feelings I have when I look at them and I think of how corrupt this system is, it is a feeling of determination to stand against this evil.
[01:57:05.760 --> 01:57:10.760]  Yeah. I mean, how are we going to look our kids in the eye and say, you know, Isabelle, that's my daughter.
[01:57:10.760 --> 01:57:17.760]  You know, this is the best it's ever going to be. Daddy stole away your American dream because we had a we had a so-called save.
[01:57:17.760 --> 01:57:20.760]  And I use that term loosely at best. Save our economy.
[01:57:20.760 --> 01:57:25.760]  Now, we couldn't deal with, you know, six months of economic hardship for continued prosperity.
[01:57:25.760 --> 01:57:31.760]  We had a steal away. This is the best car you're ever going to drive in. This is the nicest home you're ever going to live in.
[01:57:31.760 --> 01:57:35.760]  This is the finest food you're ever going to eat. This is it today.
[01:57:35.760 --> 01:57:41.760]  And you're going to have TSA grab all over you when it's all theater. Right. You have drones watching you in a Starbucks.
[01:57:41.760 --> 01:57:49.760]  We could the president's AG couldn't even answer the question that if you're in a Starbucks with your kid in the United States, on our our country.
[01:57:49.760 --> 01:57:54.760]  I've got to ask you this. What do you make of the two billion bullets they're buying, the armored vehicles, all that craziness?
[01:57:54.760 --> 01:58:00.760]  The fact that they won't answer the question is more disturbing than anything. I mean, they create their own paranoia.
[01:58:00.760 --> 01:58:07.760]  What do they need that for? Just answer the question. It's our money, our tax dollars. Why in a recession would you need that?
[01:58:07.760 --> 01:58:12.760]  I find it ironic they put out a release saying they were cutting all this training because of the sequester.
[01:58:12.760 --> 01:58:16.760]  Well, what do you do with the bullets then if you don't need them? I don't understand.
[01:58:16.760 --> 01:58:23.760]  They're trying to drop the supply. Yeah, I think it's an economic battle against the law abiding firearm owners who you can't get the ammo.
[01:58:23.760 --> 01:58:26.760]  You know, it's not the gun that does the damage. It's it's the bullet.

[02:00:04.760 --> 02:00:12.760]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover ups. You want answers? Well, so does he.
[02:00:12.760 --> 02:00:29.760]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:29.760 --> 02:00:34.760]  You know, I know I gave the number out and we ran out of time and then I got Bongino on Dan Bongino.
[02:00:34.760 --> 02:00:39.760]  But I'm a good judge of character and I've watched some of his speeches.
[02:00:39.760 --> 02:00:45.760]  Man, that guy is that guy is for real. Doesn't mean I agree with everything he stands for, because I haven't had time to follow his full platform.
[02:00:45.760 --> 02:00:49.760]  He'll be announcing a big statewide thing tomorrow in Maryland.
[02:00:49.760 --> 02:00:55.760]  Put it to you that way. It's just that, man, it's good to talk to people that aren't scum.
[02:00:55.760 --> 02:01:00.760]  Like the like the sheriff of Milwaukee County. Because it gets to me, man.
[02:01:00.760 --> 02:01:06.760]  It gets to me watching the evil just run wild. And then people act like you're weird if you get upset by it.
[02:01:06.760 --> 02:01:17.760]  I just am sick of it. I'm sick and tired of it. And I demand that men wake up and say no, no, no, no, no, no.
[02:01:17.760 --> 02:01:22.760]  Because if we were all doing our job, we wouldn't be in this position right now.
[02:01:22.760 --> 02:01:31.760]  These globalists are evil. And the only thing they got on us is that they're so evil that I guarantee if I start trying to wake up something like Bongino at first, he would think I was crazy.
[02:01:31.760 --> 02:01:35.760]  He said he liked the Piers Morgan stuff and has followed the show before.
[02:01:35.760 --> 02:01:43.760]  But still, the problem is people don't want to admit evil because it would be too crazy to admit it.
[02:01:43.760 --> 02:01:48.760]  Because it's so over the top. It's like if you saw your neighbor burying dead bodies in the backyard,
[02:01:48.760 --> 02:01:57.760]  there have been cases where people don't call the police because they just can't imagine it was the shape of a body and that they saw the guy doing it.
[02:01:57.760 --> 02:02:04.760]  It's learned helplessness. And so I understand why people don't want to believe this because it's so over the top.
[02:02:04.760 --> 02:02:12.760]  It came out for about eight years that Hitler. It was about seven years that Hitler was killing people and arresting people in mass and stuff.
[02:02:12.760 --> 02:02:18.760]  And the U.S. newspaper said they didn't call it a conspiracy theory. They called it rumors.
[02:02:18.760 --> 02:02:20.760]  They didn't use the term conspiracy theory back then.
[02:02:20.760 --> 02:02:26.760]  J. Edgar Hoover put out the term conspiracy theory saying that there's no organized crime.
[02:02:26.760 --> 02:02:30.760]  That's a conspiracy theory. That was in, I think, in 1952.
[02:02:30.760 --> 02:02:34.760]  And I had that one time from some PBS special around here.
[02:02:34.760 --> 02:02:41.760]  We've played the clip years ago with his famous congressional testimony on film saying there's no such thing as La Cosa Nostra
[02:02:41.760 --> 02:02:50.760]  and it's a conspiracy theory. But the point is, is that they called it rumors.
[02:02:50.760 --> 02:02:56.760]  And then it was rumors that Stalin, because even under Stalin, our government, our media was saying he was good.
[02:02:56.760 --> 02:03:01.760]  And then by the late 40s, it was all their rumors. Stalin's killing people.
[02:03:01.760 --> 02:03:07.760]  Yeah, just 30 million. It later came out. The Russians admit, you know, you know what, I just don't get it.
[02:03:07.760 --> 02:03:11.760]  It'd be like if I told my kids a monster's real, they'd say, no, it's not.
[02:03:11.760 --> 02:03:16.760]  No, it's not because they want to deny it. But see, these monsters are real.
[02:03:16.760 --> 02:03:22.760]  So we got a guest coming up and then I'll go to Daniel and Solomon and.
[02:03:22.760 --> 02:03:26.760]  A bunch of other people that are patiently holding Alan and Terry and Shirley.
[02:03:26.760 --> 02:03:33.760]  Am I pronouncing that right? Shirley, I can't put Shirley as a cool name, Alaska.
[02:03:33.760 --> 02:03:38.760]  But I mean, I'm going to be honest with you, I've been pretty crazed lately on air and off air.
[02:03:38.760 --> 02:03:47.760]  I told my wife this. And she's learned that when I do this, like every year, every six months, she's like, oh, my God, something's about to happen.
[02:03:47.760 --> 02:03:53.760]  I'm not going to exaggerate here with you. I mean, I'm just gonna be honest with everybody.
[02:03:53.760 --> 02:03:58.760]  The level of I don't even get chills anymore now, as much as I used to about the New World Order.
[02:03:58.760 --> 02:04:04.760]  Now I get like fight mode. OK, I mean, it's to that point, like it's right there.
[02:04:04.760 --> 02:04:09.760]  I mean, and I guess Obi-Wan Kenobi would call it a disturbance in the force or Darth Vader.
[02:04:09.760 --> 02:04:17.760]  The last time I felt it was in the presence of my old master and to be sarcastic, keep using the Star Wars analogy since Bonjino did.
[02:04:17.760 --> 02:04:23.760]  Now, every minute I was sitting there this morning after I'd exercised, sitting there in the edge of the woods.
[02:04:23.760 --> 02:04:29.760]  And I was just like totally overwhelmed with my God. It's about to get really bad.
[02:04:29.760 --> 02:04:34.760]  I don't know what it's going to be. A nuke going off. Maybe North Korea is about to go nuclear.
[02:04:34.760 --> 02:04:38.760]  I don't know. Maybe they're about to hit Japan with a nuke or something. I don't know.
[02:04:38.760 --> 02:04:42.760]  All I know is my spidey sense is.
[02:04:42.760 --> 02:04:49.760]  Ten times what it's ever been, just like danger, Will Robinson, danger, danger, danger.
[02:04:49.760 --> 02:04:53.760]  I mean, that's all I can tell you. And I'm sure you're feeling it. My wife's feeling it.
[02:04:53.760 --> 02:04:59.760]  Pray to God for protection, because I'm telling you, the hammer is about to come down.
[02:04:59.760 --> 02:05:08.760]  Devastating events like earthquakes, tornadoes, floods, hurricanes or the threat of martial law have highlighted the need for Americans to prepare for emergencies.
[02:05:08.760 --> 02:05:12.760]  As a result, millions are stockpiling food, gold and weapons.

[02:08:00.760 --> 02:08:05.760]  Music
[02:08:05.760 --> 02:08:10.760]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[02:08:10.760 --> 02:08:14.760]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:08:14.760 --> 02:08:41.760]  Music
[02:08:41.760 --> 02:08:47.760]  Oh, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:08:47.760 --> 02:08:53.760]  I just ran down the other side of the building. I was having a quick meeting on some equipment purchases.
[02:08:53.760 --> 02:08:59.760]  Nobody in radio or TV works like I do. I'm not complaining about it. I'm just letting you know why I'm out of breath.
[02:08:59.760 --> 02:09:06.760]  This building is so big. With the construction we're doing, I have to go around the building to get to the other side.
[02:09:06.760 --> 02:09:16.760]  I'm certainly not in good shape like basketball players. I just ran down here to get back on air as we expand the info war here.
[02:09:16.760 --> 02:09:20.760]  We're going to go to our guest here in just a moment.
[02:09:20.760 --> 02:09:29.760]  But first, I want to play a short clip of Biden calling for a new world order, which separately the FBI has taught doesn't exist.
[02:09:29.760 --> 02:09:39.760]  You're a terrorist if you say this exists. So I guess people better talk to Biden. Maybe he's gone insane because he's talking to the import export bank about something that doesn't exist.
[02:09:39.760 --> 02:09:41.760]  Here it is.
[02:09:41.760 --> 02:09:54.760]  The affirmative task we have now is to actually create a new world order because the global order is changing again.
[02:09:54.760 --> 02:10:03.760]  And the institutions and the rules that worked so well in the post-World War II era for decades, they need to be strengthened and some have to be changed.
[02:10:03.760 --> 02:10:10.760]  So we have to do what we do best. We have to lead. We have to lead. We have to update the global rules of the road.
[02:10:10.760 --> 02:10:17.760]  We have to do it in a way that maximizes benefits for everyone because obviously it's overwhelmingly in our interest.
[02:10:17.760 --> 02:10:30.760]  This is not a zero sum game. It's overwhelmingly in our interest that China prosper, that Mongolia prosper, that nations big and large, East and West.
[02:10:30.760 --> 02:10:37.760]  We have to level the playing field so the American companies and workers can compete in the world that the competition is fair.
[02:10:37.760 --> 02:10:43.760]  OK, so he's talking about a new world order and that sounds good. Everybody, you know, is fair. Everybody's happy.
[02:10:43.760 --> 02:10:51.760]  Apple has plants that are the worst in China with people committing suicide off of them to the point they had to put suicide nets up.
[02:10:51.760 --> 02:11:01.760]  And meanwhile, the Democratic Party, to a great extent, and a lot of Republicans as well, are so dumb, they don't even know that clips are reusable.
[02:11:01.760 --> 02:11:09.760]  Here's state rep out in Colorado. I just can't get over this saying we got to ban over 15 round mags because you throw them away after that.
[02:11:09.760 --> 02:11:19.760]  You know, you could only use them use use them once the bullets are gone, like it's a disposable air freshener can or something.
[02:11:19.760 --> 02:11:23.760]  So a lot of it isn't just authoritarians. They are up on top.
[02:11:23.760 --> 02:11:30.760]  They actually believe Obamacare is going to give them free health care when on record, it's already doubling it this year.
[02:11:30.760 --> 02:11:37.760]  Doesn't cover preexisting conditions, sets up death panels. It was written by the insurance companies, written by Mitt Romney.
[02:11:37.760 --> 02:11:42.760]  I mean, it's all just one. When he says our interests, he means the big mega banks that want to get rid of the middle class.
[02:11:42.760 --> 02:11:44.760]  Here is this clip. Go ahead.
[02:11:44.760 --> 02:11:53.760]  I do think that we can pass those. And just very briefly, to your last question, what's the efficacy of banning these magazine clips?
[02:11:53.760 --> 02:12:02.760]  I will tell you, these are ammunition. They're bullets. So the people who have those now, they're going to shoot them.
[02:12:02.760 --> 02:12:16.760]  And so if you ban if you ban them in the future, the number of these high capacity magazines is going to decrease dramatically over time because the bullets will have been shot and there won't be any more available.
[02:12:16.760 --> 02:12:25.760]  Diane DeGette, Democrat from Colorado. And I mean, how do you deal with people that really think the government's going to give everything free forever and then it won't wreck the society?
[02:12:25.760 --> 02:12:33.760]  How do you deal with people that don't know crimes drop forty nine percent because of the proliferation of firearms, FBI statistics?
[02:12:33.760 --> 02:12:41.760]  How do you deal with people that think that GMO food is healthy and that there shouldn't be labeling?
[02:12:41.760 --> 02:12:49.760]  How do you deal with people that support the government saying they're going to put aspartame in milk and thousands of other products and not tell you what's in there?
[02:12:49.760 --> 02:12:56.760]  I mean, this is way past liberal conservative, folks. This is about common sense and a society gone mad now.
[02:12:56.760 --> 02:13:08.760]  You know, I've got info worse health dot com, and I like to every week or so get a guest on who's involved with the longevity products that I'm heavily involved with the beyond tangy tangerine, all of it.
[02:13:08.760 --> 02:13:16.760]  And I was looking at a list of people I could have one that are involved. There's a bunch of really cool people we're going to be getting on very soon, including some.
[02:13:16.760 --> 02:13:24.760]  Well, I'm just going to leave it at that. But I saw this thing. I said, Mike Glenn, the stinger, I wasn't even a big basketball fan because I didn't watch a lot of TV.
[02:13:24.760 --> 02:13:30.760]  You know, I'd watch the playoffs with my mom, who was a bigger sports fan than my dad, a basketball.
[02:13:30.760 --> 02:13:34.760]  Well, my dad was always working too hard to get into sports, but I mean, I was a fan of the stinger.
[02:13:34.760 --> 02:13:38.760]  I said, Mike Glenn. And then I went, wait a minute, I've seen him do interviews.
[02:13:38.760 --> 02:13:48.760]  And one time I was staying at somebody's house and read a few chapters on one of the books about, you know, the real black history in this country and some of the amazing people that you never, never hear of.
[02:13:48.760 --> 02:13:52.760]  And then I was kind of at a quandary. Should I have him on about Young Jevity and info worse health dot com?
[02:13:52.760 --> 02:13:57.760]  Or should I get Mike Glenn on about his books, which I've ordered and I'm going to end up reading?
[02:13:57.760 --> 02:14:01.760]  Because I remember going, wait, I read part of one of his books. I had to leave the book there.
[02:14:01.760 --> 02:14:05.760]  And because so many times you're busy, you don't finish a book, even though it was interesting.
[02:14:05.760 --> 02:14:08.760]  I didn't have time. I was visiting some friends a few years ago.
[02:14:08.760 --> 02:14:15.760]  So I wanted to get him on today about also he has a basketball camp for hearing impaired children.
[02:14:15.760 --> 02:14:20.760]  He's just a really, really, really interesting individual. Mike Glenn dot com.
[02:14:20.760 --> 02:14:31.760]  And he's the guy that got so many of the other big NBA people like Theo Ratliff and others that we've had on the show, got them on the Young Jevity products.
[02:14:31.760 --> 02:14:35.760]  And those testimonies are up at info worse health dot com. But these really are miraculous.
[02:14:35.760 --> 02:14:40.760]  But I don't have him on the infomercial. We'll plug it later in the hour and go to some of your phone calls here.
[02:14:40.760 --> 02:14:43.760]  But, Mike, it's good to have you on the stinger.
[02:14:43.760 --> 02:14:48.760]  Thank you so much. It's a pleasure for me to be all thanks for that wonderful introduction.
[02:14:48.760 --> 02:14:50.760]  Just happy to spend some time with you, sir.
[02:14:50.760 --> 02:14:53.760]  You bet. Wow. Where should we start?
[02:14:53.760 --> 02:14:59.760]  Talk about your books, because what's interesting about them is you don't just cover the folks that are more famous.
[02:14:59.760 --> 02:15:05.760]  Some of them are in there. But you talk about just how interesting, because I personally like Buffalo Soldiers, all that stuff.
[02:15:05.760 --> 02:15:10.760]  I mean, black history in America is not exactly what we're taught on the nightly news.
[02:15:10.760 --> 02:15:13.760]  Well, you are so right, Alex. Appreciate your asking me about that.
[02:15:13.760 --> 02:15:19.760]  And Alex, I grew up in a household where my dad was the coach as well as the teacher and my mom was a teacher.
[02:15:19.760 --> 02:15:23.760]  So we were reading. We had study periods even in the summertime.
[02:15:23.760 --> 02:15:29.760]  And mom had this question after the study period. She said, okay, now what lesson did you learn from what you read?
[02:15:29.760 --> 02:15:32.760]  So we always had to be able to tell a lesson that we learned.
[02:15:32.760 --> 02:15:38.760]  If we had a speaker in school or we read a magazine, newspaper or book, she wanted to know what lesson did you learn.
[02:15:38.760 --> 02:15:42.760]  So this kind of stayed with me, Alex, throughout my life.
[02:15:42.760 --> 02:15:48.760]  And after retiring from pro basketball, I decided to write some books and center them around lessons that I learned,
[02:15:48.760 --> 02:15:55.760]  whether they were lessons from my collection of books that I owned, thousands of books that I've collected, rare first edition books.
[02:15:55.760 --> 02:15:59.760]  And I decided to just start writing series on lessons that I've learned.
[02:15:59.760 --> 02:16:09.760]  My first one was I went to my NBA teammates, ex-teammates, Bulls, opponents, and it was titled Lessons in Success from the NBA's Top Players.
[02:16:09.760 --> 02:16:15.760]  And I went to all of those players, Alex, Michael, Jordan, Shaquille, O'Neal, Karl Malone, John Stockton, all of them.
[02:16:15.760 --> 02:16:21.760]  And I asked them what's the two most important lessons they learned to be successful in basketball and life.
[02:16:21.760 --> 02:16:23.760]  So the first book was very interesting.
[02:16:23.760 --> 02:16:27.760]  A lot of coaches, a lot of teams, a lot of individuals bought it.
[02:16:27.760 --> 02:16:31.760]  All the NBA players loved to get other people's perspectives on what made them successful.
[02:16:31.760 --> 02:16:36.760]  And then I did a lot of other history and research through the books in my library as well.
[02:16:36.760 --> 02:16:38.760]  I started writing biographies.
[02:16:38.760 --> 02:16:41.760]  I started writing about the integration of sports history.
[02:16:41.760 --> 02:16:47.760]  I looked at history before Jackie Robinson. I looked at African American athletes that preceded Jackie Robinson,
[02:16:47.760 --> 02:16:52.760]  who were kind of just swept under the carpet, forgotten, and never mentioned again.
[02:16:52.760 --> 02:16:54.760]  So I told a lot of their stories in one of my books.
[02:16:54.760 --> 02:17:01.760]  And then I also wrote on Frederick Douglass the pre-Civil War years of Frederick Douglass and its impact on America and society.
[02:17:01.760 --> 02:17:08.760]  So those were kind of some passionate areas that I've written about, talked about, gone to a lot of places and discussed them,
[02:17:08.760 --> 02:17:11.760]  and really enjoy even exhibiting Alex.
[02:17:11.760 --> 02:17:17.760]  I collect rare first-edition books, so oftentimes I will bring with me some first-edition books
[02:17:17.760 --> 02:17:22.760]  so people can see the power of these books as documents of American history.
[02:17:22.760 --> 02:17:24.760]  For one of my favorite ones is Frederick Douglass' book,
[02:17:24.760 --> 02:17:30.760]  A Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass and America's Slave, written by himself, which he wrote in 1845.
[02:17:30.760 --> 02:17:33.760]  And it was published in the Anti-Slavery Office of Boston.
[02:17:33.760 --> 02:17:39.760]  So I'll take this book and I'll show them when it was published and the content,
[02:17:39.760 --> 02:17:42.760]  but the book itself is a document of history.
[02:17:42.760 --> 02:17:49.760]  So I try to combine all of these things together and make it very fun and interesting and bring history to life
[02:17:49.760 --> 02:17:55.760]  and try to, you know, foster literacy and research and study as well.
[02:17:55.760 --> 02:18:00.760]  You know, I've actually got a painting of Frederick Douglass in there in the office.
[02:18:00.760 --> 02:18:04.760]  We're going to create a new set that's got a bunch of paintings of famous people that I admire.
[02:18:04.760 --> 02:18:09.760]  And I've actually read the book you're speaking of probably 20 years ago.
[02:18:09.760 --> 02:18:13.760]  Amazing quotes and ideas about liberty.
[02:18:13.760 --> 02:18:14.760]  I paraphrased one of them.
[02:18:14.760 --> 02:18:16.760]  He said, liberty and freedom is never given.
[02:18:16.760 --> 02:18:19.760]  It's taken, it's demanded, to paraphrase that quote.
[02:18:19.760 --> 02:18:21.760]  Absolutely right.
[02:18:21.760 --> 02:18:22.760]  What a tremendous giant.
[02:18:22.760 --> 02:18:23.760]  You're so right, Alex.
[02:18:23.760 --> 02:18:24.760]  And it's so worthy of everybody.
[02:18:24.760 --> 02:18:28.760]  It should be a must-read for all who haven't read it in all schools as well
[02:18:28.760 --> 02:18:35.760]  because he certainly was a proponent of that, fighting for liberty continuously and agitating and petitioning
[02:18:35.760 --> 02:18:41.760]  and understanding how freedom works and how things that are not for your freedom work against you.
[02:18:41.760 --> 02:18:48.760]  So one of his first speeches, as a matter of fact, my mom, one of her favorite quotes was this one that I've kind of carried with me
[02:18:48.760 --> 02:18:54.760]  and I've labeled one of my exhibits that it was, as Frederick Douglass says, a young boy about eight years old,
[02:18:54.760 --> 02:19:01.760]  Sophia Old and her husband Hugh had been the people that were in charge of him, had enslaved him,
[02:19:01.760 --> 02:19:05.760]  and she had taught him how to read at his request and he learned a few things
[02:19:05.760 --> 02:19:11.760]  and they were going to show her husband Hugh what he had learned and all of a sudden Hugh said,
[02:19:11.760 --> 02:19:13.760]  hey, what are you doing teaching that slave how to read?
[02:19:13.760 --> 02:19:18.760]  Don't you know that if he learns how to read he won't be fit to be a slave anymore?
[02:19:18.760 --> 02:19:22.760]  So that was a quote that Frederick Douglass remembered the rest of his life,
[02:19:22.760 --> 02:19:26.760]  my mom's favorite quote as a teacher and it was kind of important to me once you learn how to read
[02:19:26.760 --> 02:19:32.760]  it won't be fit to be a slave anymore and it was a proponent of, he said that was the pathway from slavery to freedom
[02:19:32.760 --> 02:19:36.760]  was through reading and literacy and learning who you are, what you are, what liberty is.
[02:19:36.760 --> 02:19:42.760]  Mine as well, I mean, growing up I happened to get into history books just because they were so action packed every page
[02:19:42.760 --> 02:19:46.760]  and then if you know history you know how humans act over and over again
[02:19:46.760 --> 02:19:51.760]  so I can now recognize the oppression and the modern attempts at slavery today that are more sophisticated
[02:19:51.760 --> 02:19:57.760]  like I have all the Department of Education documents and they're in Charlotte Iserby's phone book size book
[02:19:57.760 --> 02:20:03.760]  when she was the head of policy there where they actually planned to dumb everybody down
[02:20:03.760 --> 02:20:09.760]  so they could be brought into a collective and they're now coming out saying, you know, the state owns your children
[02:20:09.760 --> 02:20:15.760]  and the state will control what you do. What's your view on the new authoritarianism we see growing today?
[02:20:15.760 --> 02:20:20.760]  I think you guys are mentioning points there and I think that's why it's so important that we continue to read,
[02:20:20.760 --> 02:20:26.760]  to study, to learn, to look before the surface because Alex you're so right, everything is so short term
[02:20:26.760 --> 02:20:32.760]  surface, look at the top, keep it moving to short attention span so you really never, people really never
[02:20:32.760 --> 02:20:38.760]  look below the surface and see the long term implications and what is actually said and take time to dig deeper.
[02:20:38.760 --> 02:20:46.760]  So I totally agree with you, I think there's so much of that in society today that everything rather than being elevated
[02:20:46.760 --> 02:20:52.760]  you don't have people in positions that can help elevate the thinking, the thought process that goes into
[02:20:52.760 --> 02:20:59.760]  progression, you have so many people all across the page, the book is just, that now is just talking
[02:20:59.760 --> 02:21:05.760]  and there's really not much substance to it so I think there is a dumbing down for sure and even when you read
[02:21:05.760 --> 02:21:10.760]  from people of a century ago you're, wow, look at how they wrote and thought, it was a lot that went into it
[02:21:10.760 --> 02:21:14.760]  maybe more so than we see on a day to day basis today.
[02:21:14.760 --> 02:21:18.760]  Well you're absolutely right about that, I mean there's so many great quotes I just pulled up here of Frederick Douglas
[02:21:18.760 --> 02:21:25.760]  but people might not get all they work for in this world but they must certainly work for all they get
[02:21:25.760 --> 02:21:34.760]  and then he goes on to say, this is a shortened version of it, power concedes nothing without a demand, it never did and it never will.
[02:21:34.760 --> 02:21:41.760]  Yes, that was one of his most famous ones as well and you know he was just saying that you have to continue to work
[02:21:41.760 --> 02:21:50.760]  and to agitate and to knock down walls of resistance and to fight hard for what you want and you know it's a glorious
[02:21:50.760 --> 02:21:58.760]  quote that was very well said by Frederick Douglas in 1857 so yes he has some fabulous quotes, I mean all of his
[02:21:58.760 --> 02:22:04.760]  three books were just fabulous documents of American history and good history books as well as just perspectives on
[02:22:04.760 --> 02:22:07.760]  liberation and self empowerment.
[02:22:07.760 --> 02:22:14.760]  Mike Glenn the Stinger, NBA legend is our guest, mikeglenn.com, here's another one, the limits of tyrants are prescribed
[02:22:14.760 --> 02:22:23.760]  by the endurance of those of whom they oppress, you see they want to break us now with the whole you know police state,
[02:22:23.760 --> 02:22:29.760]  the wars, all of it, Mike what is your view on where humanity is today?
[02:22:29.760 --> 02:22:37.760]  Well I think there's still, as long as there are voices out there, we always have both sides of the coin out there
[02:22:37.760 --> 02:22:45.760]  and I think we have to be really diligent in keeping forth the positive voices on humanity to break down barriers
[02:22:45.760 --> 02:22:53.760]  that separate people, bring people together, show a light of leadership in a progressive way that gives opportunity,
[02:22:53.760 --> 02:23:01.760]  you know supports working hard, achieving goals, believing you can do things, not allowing people to suppress you.
[02:23:01.760 --> 02:23:09.760]  Exactly, but see Frederick Douglas talked about a real progression meaning humans getting better, what about the
[02:23:09.760 --> 02:23:13.760]  socialists that take the word progressive and have now created counterfeits, how do you deal with that?
[02:23:13.760 --> 02:23:20.760]  Yeah it's not an easy thing to do and you have to keep your voice heard, I think Alex you certainly, and the more we hear
[02:23:20.760 --> 02:23:29.760]  voices that show another way, a better way, I think through all these voices that it gives opportunity for people to find
[02:23:29.760 --> 02:23:34.760]  a best path, as long as they believe that they can do it, as long as they have the energy to fight, to push, to achieve,
[02:23:34.760 --> 02:23:42.760]  to learn, to grow, they'll create those opportunities, so that's one thing I do Alex, whether it's through nutrition,
[02:23:42.760 --> 02:23:47.760]  whether it's through history, whether it's through deaf people, learn to be assimilated into mainstream,
[02:23:47.760 --> 02:23:53.760]  I want people to know that they can empower themselves, they can have their dreams, they can live their dreams,
[02:23:53.760 --> 02:23:57.760]  they can accomplish things and the self empowerment.
[02:23:57.760 --> 02:24:05.760]  Well Mike that's what I picked up reading one of your books is that I get the thrill out of teaching somebody something
[02:24:05.760 --> 02:24:12.760]  or I get the thrill out of seeing people excel and there are just so many out there that are so pitiful, they think when
[02:24:12.760 --> 02:24:18.760]  someone else excels that's bringing them down and there are people that have excelled that think they excel by bringing
[02:24:18.760 --> 02:24:24.760]  others down and it's just really sad, here's one more Frederick Douglass quote, the life of a nation is secure only
[02:24:24.760 --> 02:24:31.760]  while the nation is honest, truthful and virtuous, but there's so many unhappy people out there and I think they're
[02:24:31.760 --> 02:24:38.760]  unhappy because they're not building others up, tell us about your foundation and the basketball camp and how many
[02:24:38.760 --> 02:24:42.760]  folks that have been deaf or hearing impaired that you've helped.
[02:24:42.760 --> 02:24:48.760]  Well thanks very much Alex, my dad actually started the sports program there at Georgia School for the Deaf before I was born
[02:24:48.760 --> 02:24:56.760]  so he coached every sport they had there at the deaf school and so I grew up loving basketball and I would go to basketball
[02:24:56.760 --> 02:25:03.760]  camp and I noticed that my deaf friends could never go, I spent countless hours at the deaf school, they had the dormitories
[02:25:03.760 --> 02:25:10.760]  there, I would stay in his classrooms, went to the dormitories, went to the gym, went to all the practices and I noticed
[02:25:10.760 --> 02:25:15.760]  they could never go to camp, they were always sad and the summer I would ask them did you guys go to basketball camp
[02:25:15.760 --> 02:25:20.760]  and they said there was no camp, so Alex I kind of made a promise to myself that one day I would like to start a camp
[02:25:20.760 --> 02:25:26.760]  just for deaf kids because I thought they deserved a chance to go, they were great basketball players, they loved the game
[02:25:26.760 --> 02:25:32.760]  like anybody else did so why shouldn't they have an opportunity to live their dreams and go as far as their talents
[02:25:32.760 --> 02:25:38.760]  would take them so when I got to the NBA I talked about it at several places and as a member of the New York Knicks
[02:25:38.760 --> 02:25:45.760]  I started the nation's first basketball camp for deaf kids, this was 33 years ago so I started the free camp
[02:25:45.760 --> 02:25:51.760]  first I had about 30 kids to come to that first camp on Long Island, New York at Mill Neck School for the Deaf
[02:25:51.760 --> 02:25:58.760]  and then I started expanding it, girls and boys and kids were coming from all across the country to this free camp
[02:25:58.760 --> 02:26:08.760]  and it meant so much to them to have an opportunity to go to camp, to be included, to interact with other kids
[02:26:08.760 --> 02:26:14.760]  to meet pro NBA players, to come inside autographs and take pictures, it was just the best week of their life
[02:26:14.760 --> 02:26:23.760]  so I decided that each year I would have this camp and I would dedicate each week to tell the students this will be the best week of your life
[02:26:23.760 --> 02:26:30.760]  all of our staff members, we tell them on the first day, welcome, we're glad to have you here, this is the camp for you
[02:26:30.760 --> 02:26:36.760]  and our mission is for you to have the best week of your life so each year I average from 80 to 100 kids
[02:26:36.760 --> 02:26:42.760]  and you take that over the 33 years, some years I would do two camps, one in New York and one in Atlanta
[02:26:42.760 --> 02:26:48.760]  now I just do the one in Atlanta, every summer we start on Father's Day, it's kind of a tribute to my dad
[02:26:48.760 --> 02:26:56.760]  who he's passed on now but the heritage, the legacy from him is this camp that kind of lives through me
[02:26:56.760 --> 02:27:03.760]  and so we start on that day and we have kids and Alex is just the best week of my life, I mean all the coaches are there because they care
[02:27:03.760 --> 02:27:09.760]  nobody is there because they're getting money to be, how much money am I going to get, it's all about caring about the kids
[02:27:09.760 --> 02:27:15.760]  giving them an opportunity, loving the game of basketball and just having as much fun as you can with it
[02:27:15.760 --> 02:27:22.760]  so it's a blessing to end my life and I'm just so blessed to have people like Young Jimmy, we give them nutrition
[02:27:22.760 --> 02:27:29.760]  Dr. Wallach has come in and talked to them about nutrition to help their health, help their game, so we expand them
[02:27:29.760 --> 02:27:36.760]  Martin Luther King Jr., the 3rd brothers come in, Andrew Young, I mean we've just had not only basketball players
[02:27:36.760 --> 02:27:40.760]  not only people in nutrition but people from various walks of life, other sports
[02:27:40.760 --> 02:27:45.760]  Roddy White, an all pro football receiver came in and talked to us a couple of years ago
[02:27:45.760 --> 02:27:51.760]  he said I've never been to a basketball camp and certainly never been to a camp for deaf kids, that's one of the best camps I've ever been to
[02:27:51.760 --> 02:27:57.760]  the kids loved him, I mean just the hugs, the love, the real from heart to heart Alex cannot be beat
[02:27:57.760 --> 02:28:03.760]  and so I think it's really a model my camp is where you've got girls and boys, I have kids that can hear also
[02:28:03.760 --> 02:28:07.760]  they have to come to the camp, I tell them look you may have a deaf coach, you're going to have some deaf teammates
[02:28:07.760 --> 02:28:11.760]  but I want you to learn to get along with kids that are very different from you
[02:28:11.760 --> 02:28:14.760]  they may speak different, look different, they may not speak at all
[02:28:14.760 --> 02:28:18.760]  but I want you all to get along and form a basketball team and we're going to play ball
[02:28:18.760 --> 02:28:21.760]  and that's what we do every summer and we love it
[02:28:21.760 --> 02:28:26.760]  Well I tell you people are blessed to be able to go to that and it's another example of private individuals taking action
[02:28:26.760 --> 02:28:29.760]  building their dreams and helping others
[02:28:29.760 --> 02:28:33.760]  Mike Glenn is our guest, I tell you when I saw that name on a piece of paper I said wow
[02:28:33.760 --> 02:28:39.760]  he's doing interviews about health and the things you discovered with that
[02:28:39.760 --> 02:28:42.760]  but I said I want him on about all this other stuff that I knew you were doing
[02:28:42.760 --> 02:28:46.760]  so the stinger, the stinger is on with us right now MikeGlenn.com
[02:28:46.760 --> 02:28:50.760]  we're going to post this video, this radio interview of your TV viewer
[02:28:50.760 --> 02:28:53.760]  you're obviously seeing it now but for radio listeners by tomorrow
[02:28:53.760 --> 02:28:57.760]  we'll have this interview posted up at InfowarsHealth.com if you're a radio listener
[02:28:57.760 --> 02:28:59.760]  and want to be able to see the TV side
[02:28:59.760 --> 02:29:03.760]  we're going to go to break and come back and talk about health issues
[02:29:03.760 --> 02:29:07.760]  Younggevity, you were one of the people that got into it very very early
[02:29:07.760 --> 02:29:10.760]  you've gotten so many other MBA people into it as well
[02:29:10.760 --> 02:29:14.760]  because anything I promote is something I truly believe in
[02:29:14.760 --> 02:29:18.760]  and Younggevity and the products at InfowarsHealth.com are the best out there
[02:29:18.760 --> 02:29:24.760]  but also it funds our operation just like you were saying Younggevity helping fund stuff for deaf kids
[02:29:24.760 --> 02:29:30.760]  I don't think people know that Dr. Wallach has won against the Food and Drug Administration himself three times
[02:29:30.760 --> 02:29:32.760]  with other lawyers seven times
[02:29:32.760 --> 02:29:38.760]  we've had some of those lawyers on, these are the famous cases that allow supplementation period
[02:29:38.760 --> 02:29:41.760]  and I just can't believe the type of guess we get on
[02:29:41.760 --> 02:29:44.760]  but these guys never brag about themselves like Dr. Wallach and others
[02:29:44.760 --> 02:29:47.760]  so we'll brag on them with Mike Glenn, the stinger
[02:29:47.760 --> 02:29:49.760]  straight ahead I'm Alex Jones

[02:33:17.760 --> 02:33:21.760]  well we've got the stinger on with us here
[02:33:21.760 --> 02:33:24.760]  Mike Glenn, very famous NBA player
[02:33:24.760 --> 02:33:26.760]  for those of you that don't follow the NBA
[02:33:26.760 --> 02:33:27.760]  like I didn't follow it much
[02:33:27.760 --> 02:33:29.760]  and I always like watching the stinger
[02:33:29.760 --> 02:33:33.760]  but I guess people like the guy that's a little bit smaller
[02:33:33.760 --> 02:33:34.760]  and everybody else is kicking their butt
[02:33:34.760 --> 02:33:35.760]  I think that might be what it is
[02:33:35.760 --> 02:33:37.760]  is that why you were so popular Mike?
[02:33:37.760 --> 02:33:38.760]  yeah that's part of it man
[02:33:38.760 --> 02:33:41.760]  the little guy that always shot the ball so well from the outside
[02:33:41.760 --> 02:33:44.760]  that's how I earned the nickname the stinger Alex
[02:33:44.760 --> 02:33:47.760]  and then I played the game like you're trying to live
[02:33:47.760 --> 02:33:49.760]  you're just playing as an expression of who you are
[02:33:49.760 --> 02:33:51.760]  so played hard and played fair
[02:33:51.760 --> 02:33:54.760]  and you know I think people like the way I played the game too
[02:33:54.760 --> 02:33:58.760]  you've got a film coming out that just won a big Christian award
[02:33:58.760 --> 02:34:00.760]  and you're going to be doing screenings on that
[02:34:00.760 --> 02:34:02.760]  the system obviously doesn't want films like this out there
[02:34:02.760 --> 02:34:04.760]  but it's got some really good reviews
[02:34:04.760 --> 02:34:05.760]  tell us about that
[02:34:05.760 --> 02:34:06.760]  yeah thanks very much Alex
[02:34:06.760 --> 02:34:09.760]  it's called the spirit of love movie dot com
[02:34:09.760 --> 02:34:12.760]  the spirit of love movie dot com
[02:34:12.760 --> 02:34:15.760]  and it traces my growing up around deaf kids
[02:34:15.760 --> 02:34:19.760]  and then it goes all the way, goes forward to
[02:34:19.760 --> 02:34:21.760]  by running this basketball camp for deaf kids
[02:34:21.760 --> 02:34:26.760]  kids coming in and different personalities and characters
[02:34:26.760 --> 02:34:29.760]  and going through the camp and having an all star game at the end
[02:34:29.760 --> 02:34:32.760]  where we play against very good kids that can hear and talk
[02:34:32.760 --> 02:34:34.760]  so it's a great movie
[02:34:34.760 --> 02:34:37.760]  I mean so many great messages of sharing inclusion
[02:34:37.760 --> 02:34:41.760]  and it's like the film says the spirit of love movie dot com
[02:34:41.760 --> 02:34:43.760]  the Mike Glantz story
[02:34:43.760 --> 02:34:45.760]  so we were in Texas doing all star weekend
[02:34:45.760 --> 02:34:47.760]  at the Texas Christian Film Festival
[02:34:47.760 --> 02:34:50.760]  and we won the most inspirational movie of that festival
[02:34:50.760 --> 02:34:54.760]  and then we have four out of five dubs from that rating agency as well
[02:34:54.760 --> 02:34:56.760]  so right now we're doing screenings
[02:34:56.760 --> 02:34:58.760]  we're looking for the right distributor
[02:34:58.760 --> 02:35:00.760]  my producer Dollar A is out of Denver
[02:35:00.760 --> 02:35:02.760]  and so we got a screening in Denver in May
[02:35:02.760 --> 02:35:05.760]  we have one in Atlanta coming up in May
[02:35:05.760 --> 02:35:09.760]  and so we encourage people just go to the spirit of love movie dot com
[02:35:09.760 --> 02:35:11.760]  we got to Facebook and all those social media things
[02:35:11.760 --> 02:35:13.760]  Alex said I'm not the best at but we got it there
[02:35:13.760 --> 02:35:16.760]  so they can interact that way as well
[02:35:16.760 --> 02:35:18.760]  well very exciting what you're doing
[02:35:18.760 --> 02:35:20.760]  I mean already so successful monetarily
[02:35:20.760 --> 02:35:22.760]  everything and to still be working so hard
[02:35:22.760 --> 02:35:23.760]  that's what it's all about
[02:35:23.760 --> 02:35:25.760]  Mike Glenn is our guest
[02:35:25.760 --> 02:35:27.760]  I wanted to have some positive things today
[02:35:27.760 --> 02:35:30.760]  now you're also on the sports advisory board for Younggevity
[02:35:30.760 --> 02:35:32.760]  which is by the way folks
[02:35:32.760 --> 02:35:34.760]  growing to be one of the biggest vitamin mineral companies out there
[02:35:34.760 --> 02:35:37.760]  and that's why I chose them as a sponsor a few years ago
[02:35:37.760 --> 02:35:40.760]  because that's seen amazing effects here on crew members
[02:35:40.760 --> 02:35:43.760]  even though it's not advertised as weight loss losing 97 pounds
[02:35:43.760 --> 02:35:45.760]  myself and stamina
[02:35:45.760 --> 02:35:47.760]  because I'd gotten out of shape doing nothing for about 10 years
[02:35:47.760 --> 02:35:49.760]  my mother triathlete
[02:35:49.760 --> 02:35:51.760]  just says it's incredible
[02:35:51.760 --> 02:35:54.760]  and it's all available at info horse health dot com
[02:35:54.760 --> 02:35:55.760]  and your purchase there
[02:35:55.760 --> 02:35:58.760]  on the site of info horse health dot com I should add
[02:35:58.760 --> 02:36:01.760]  also funds our operation to a great extent
[02:36:01.760 --> 02:36:02.760]  and what we're doing
[02:36:02.760 --> 02:36:04.760]  so you're buying from the good guys
[02:36:04.760 --> 02:36:07.760]  and helping us build our liberty oriented media organization
[02:36:07.760 --> 02:36:12.760]  but you got Theo Ratliff and other famous NBA stars in on it
[02:36:12.760 --> 02:36:14.760]  Theo was going to have to retire that's on record
[02:36:14.760 --> 02:36:17.760]  gave him what 10 more years in it and 30 something million dollars
[02:36:17.760 --> 02:36:19.760]  break down your experience with Doc Wallet
[02:36:19.760 --> 02:36:24.760]  when that started and why you promote Younggevity
[02:36:24.760 --> 02:36:25.760]  well thanks very much Alex
[02:36:25.760 --> 02:36:28.760]  about 14 years ago a friend of mine named Bill Oliver
[02:36:28.760 --> 02:36:29.760]  who worked at Fickle Cell
[02:36:29.760 --> 02:36:32.760]  and Doc had helped him with a lot of Fickle Cell patients
[02:36:32.760 --> 02:36:36.760]  with how they could be healthier through mineral nutrition
[02:36:36.760 --> 02:36:40.760]  and so he insisted I mean he was very persistent
[02:36:40.760 --> 02:36:43.760]  and he insisted that I try these minerals
[02:36:43.760 --> 02:36:47.760]  and so I did use them
[02:36:47.760 --> 02:36:50.760]  and it really helped me tremendously
[02:36:50.760 --> 02:36:52.760]  and I started sharing the story with others
[02:36:52.760 --> 02:36:55.760]  and Theo is a very interesting story also
[02:36:55.760 --> 02:36:58.760]  because I was talking to one of the other players on the Hawks
[02:36:58.760 --> 02:37:01.760]  I was doing color analysis for him on TV
[02:37:01.760 --> 02:37:03.760]  and he'd had some problems the health problems
[02:37:03.760 --> 02:37:05.760]  that he couldn't find a solution to
[02:37:05.760 --> 02:37:08.760]  and Theo overheard me I wasn't even talking to Theo
[02:37:08.760 --> 02:37:10.760]  and Theo was having problems himself
[02:37:10.760 --> 02:37:13.760]  he had a detached bone and I think you've had him over
[02:37:13.760 --> 02:37:14.760]  he's probably gone over
[02:37:14.760 --> 02:37:16.760]  got to go over it again it's important
[02:37:16.760 --> 02:37:19.760]  okay Theo had a detached bone in his hip
[02:37:19.760 --> 02:37:20.760]  that was his biggest problem
[02:37:20.760 --> 02:37:23.760]  and in his knee he had bone to bone arthritis
[02:37:23.760 --> 02:37:26.760]  it would swell so big after games they would have to drain it
[02:37:26.760 --> 02:37:28.760]  he had a problem with his ankle
[02:37:28.760 --> 02:37:30.760]  he had a problem with his wrist
[02:37:30.760 --> 02:37:32.760]  and a degenerative disc in his back
[02:37:32.760 --> 02:37:34.760]  Theo was finished that's why Philadelphia
[02:37:34.760 --> 02:37:36.760]  traded him to Atlanta
[02:37:36.760 --> 02:37:38.760]  they knew the guy was at the end of his rope
[02:37:38.760 --> 02:37:40.760]  and his career was going to be over
[02:37:40.760 --> 02:37:42.760]  so he was facing all of these surgeries
[02:37:42.760 --> 02:37:44.760]  the doctors could not help him
[02:37:44.760 --> 02:37:46.760]  and so he said Mike I want to talk to you
[02:37:46.760 --> 02:37:48.760]  about what you talked to Alan about
[02:37:48.760 --> 02:37:49.760]  so we took him out to dinner
[02:37:49.760 --> 02:37:51.760]  we told him he was mentally deficient
[02:37:51.760 --> 02:37:53.760]  he would never get healthy through all the surgeries
[02:37:53.760 --> 02:37:56.760]  and all the things that they were recommending to him
[02:37:56.760 --> 02:37:59.760]  so we put him on 90th century nutrients
[02:37:59.760 --> 02:38:00.760]  he was very diligent
[02:38:00.760 --> 02:38:02.760]  we introduced him to Doc
[02:38:02.760 --> 02:38:04.760]  Theo regrouped cartilage in his knee
[02:38:04.760 --> 02:38:06.760]  his back was fine
[02:38:06.760 --> 02:38:07.760]  they gave him MRIs
[02:38:07.760 --> 02:38:09.760]  they did all kinds of things
[02:38:09.760 --> 02:38:10.760]  and Theo was fine
[02:38:10.760 --> 02:38:13.760]  so he signed several more contracts
[02:38:13.760 --> 02:38:15.760]  he got everybody's family on it
[02:38:15.760 --> 02:38:18.760]  Theo became a big proponent for longevity
[02:38:18.760 --> 02:38:20.760]  and Phil Oliver the guy that introduced me
[02:38:20.760 --> 02:38:22.760]  and I we said man we need a drink
[02:38:22.760 --> 02:38:25.760]  an energy drink a nutrition drink
[02:38:25.760 --> 02:38:27.760]  that we can put Theo's picture on
[02:38:27.760 --> 02:38:30.760]  and we can really share it with other athletes
[02:38:30.760 --> 02:38:33.760]  so we tossed around and came up with the idea of rebound
[02:38:33.760 --> 02:38:36.760]  because it's a basketball term to rebound the basketball
[02:38:36.760 --> 02:38:38.760]  and he rebounded his career
[02:38:38.760 --> 02:38:40.760]  so we came up with the name rebound
[02:38:40.760 --> 02:38:42.760]  and so Doug Wallach and Steve Wallach
[02:38:42.760 --> 02:38:44.760]  and also Richard Renner they all worked with us
[02:38:44.760 --> 02:38:47.760]  and we came together they had a wonderful product
[02:38:47.760 --> 02:38:49.760]  we sampled the different flavors
[02:38:49.760 --> 02:38:51.760]  and we came up with one
[02:38:51.760 --> 02:38:53.760]  there are a couple that worked very well
[02:38:53.760 --> 02:38:55.760]  and had one with no green tea for zero
[02:38:55.760 --> 02:38:57.760]  a caffeine effect
[02:38:57.760 --> 02:38:59.760]  and from there rebound hit the market
[02:38:59.760 --> 02:39:01.760]  about seven years ago and it has not stopped
[02:39:01.760 --> 02:39:03.760]  it's just grown like wildfire
[02:39:03.760 --> 02:39:05.760]  and Alex I'm so appreciative of you
[02:39:05.760 --> 02:39:07.760]  also furnishing this voice
[02:39:07.760 --> 02:39:09.760]  to be heard about nutrition
[02:39:09.760 --> 02:39:10.760]  about rebound
[02:39:10.760 --> 02:39:12.760]  we've seen instrumental growth
[02:39:12.760 --> 02:39:14.760]  other NBA players are taking it
[02:39:14.760 --> 02:39:16.760]  other football players, baseball players
[02:39:16.760 --> 02:39:17.760]  little leagueers
[02:39:17.760 --> 02:39:19.760]  everybody is beginning to see
[02:39:19.760 --> 02:39:21.760]  they can have a real nutritious advantage
[02:39:21.760 --> 02:39:23.760]  that's what athletes live for
[02:39:23.760 --> 02:39:25.760]  we live for that little bit of difference
[02:39:25.760 --> 02:39:26.760]  because that's the difference
[02:39:26.760 --> 02:39:27.760]  well take Gatorade
[02:39:27.760 --> 02:39:29.760]  Gatorade's got three ingredients
[02:39:29.760 --> 02:39:32.760]  Younggeviti products up to ninety
[02:39:32.760 --> 02:39:34.760]  and I mean here's the bottom line
[02:39:34.760 --> 02:39:36.760]  I don't promote things that I don't believe in
[02:39:36.760 --> 02:39:38.760]  and you know I've told people to buy silver
[02:39:38.760 --> 02:39:40.760]  when it was four dollars an ounce
[02:39:40.760 --> 02:39:41.760]  and it's gone up to fifty at some point
[02:39:41.760 --> 02:39:42.760]  thirty something right now
[02:39:42.760 --> 02:39:44.760]  I said get gold when it was
[02:39:44.760 --> 02:39:45.760]  you know three hundred bucks an ounce
[02:39:45.760 --> 02:39:47.760]  and it's gone as high as two thousand
[02:39:47.760 --> 02:39:48.760]  you know the point is
[02:39:48.760 --> 02:39:50.760]  I really promote what I personally
[02:39:50.760 --> 02:39:52.760]  decide to do
[02:39:52.760 --> 02:39:55.760]  and I mean my dad's an oral surgeon
[02:39:55.760 --> 02:39:56.760]  and a dentist
[02:39:56.760 --> 02:39:57.760]  he knows a lot of other physicians
[02:39:57.760 --> 02:39:58.760]  he's in healthcare management
[02:39:58.760 --> 02:40:00.760]  not just in dental stuff
[02:40:00.760 --> 02:40:03.760]  and he says doctors are seeing classical scurvy
[02:40:03.760 --> 02:40:05.760]  with people that are on fast food diets
[02:40:05.760 --> 02:40:07.760]  and you know don't get the green leafy vegetables
[02:40:07.760 --> 02:40:09.760]  no one will tell them you've got scurvy
[02:40:09.760 --> 02:40:12.760]  hospitals don't even say eat fruit
[02:40:12.760 --> 02:40:14.760]  no one will tell anybody
[02:40:14.760 --> 02:40:17.760]  that America has off the chart diabetes
[02:40:17.760 --> 02:40:18.760]  and off the chart cancer
[02:40:18.760 --> 02:40:21.760]  because the fertilizers they're using
[02:40:21.760 --> 02:40:22.760]  have three chemicals
[02:40:22.760 --> 02:40:24.760]  or three minerals in them
[02:40:24.760 --> 02:40:25.760]  not the ninety
[02:40:25.760 --> 02:40:28.760]  and it's not rocket science
[02:40:28.760 --> 02:40:31.760]  that people need the rebound
[02:40:31.760 --> 02:40:32.760]  the beyond tangy tangerine
[02:40:32.760 --> 02:40:33.760]  the polymers plus
[02:40:33.760 --> 02:40:35.760]  all this stuff
[02:40:35.760 --> 02:40:36.760]  and that's why we sell it
[02:40:36.760 --> 02:40:37.760]  at the lowest prices
[02:40:37.760 --> 02:40:39.760]  at infowarshealth.com
[02:40:39.760 --> 02:40:41.760]  people can sign up and get free shipping there

[02:40:44.760 --> 02:40:45.760]  and get free shipping
[02:40:45.760 --> 02:40:46.760]  that's a big discount
[02:40:46.760 --> 02:40:47.760]  you can pay ten bucks
[02:40:47.760 --> 02:40:48.760]  and become a distributor
[02:40:48.760 --> 02:40:49.760]  and get discounts
[02:40:49.760 --> 02:40:50.760]  I mean but bottom line
[02:40:50.760 --> 02:40:51.760]  it's a win-win-win
[02:40:51.760 --> 02:40:52.760]  I don't get taxpayer money
[02:40:52.760 --> 02:40:53.760]  to fund my operation
[02:40:53.760 --> 02:40:54.760]  like MSNBC
[02:40:54.760 --> 02:40:55.760]  I have sponsors
[02:40:55.760 --> 02:40:56.760]  and I have products
[02:40:56.760 --> 02:40:57.760]  I sell
[02:40:57.760 --> 02:40:58.760]  that I believe in
[02:40:58.760 --> 02:41:00.760]  and it's very very simple
[02:41:00.760 --> 02:41:01.760]  I look look
[02:41:01.760 --> 02:41:02.760]  I'm the same way
[02:41:02.760 --> 02:41:03.760]  three years ago
[02:41:03.760 --> 02:41:04.760]  hey longevity is great
[02:41:04.760 --> 02:41:05.760]  yeah I know who Wallach is
[02:41:05.760 --> 02:41:06.760]  I believe in it
[02:41:06.760 --> 02:41:07.760]  they'll be a sponsor
[02:41:07.760 --> 02:41:08.760]  kind of sat there
[02:41:08.760 --> 02:41:09.760]  then I watch my wife
[02:41:09.760 --> 02:41:10.760]  my mother
[02:41:10.760 --> 02:41:11.760]  my crew
[02:41:11.760 --> 02:41:12.760]  go crazy with it
[02:41:12.760 --> 02:41:13.760]  and then I finally tried it
[02:41:13.760 --> 02:41:14.760]  more stamina
[02:41:14.760 --> 02:41:16.760]  I mean all of it
[02:41:16.760 --> 02:41:17.760]  one side effect is
[02:41:17.760 --> 02:41:18.760]  I feel like I'm 25 again
[02:41:18.760 --> 02:41:20.760]  I want to kick everybody's ass
[02:41:20.760 --> 02:41:21.760]  but excuse me
[02:41:21.760 --> 02:41:22.760]  but I mean I mean really
[02:41:22.760 --> 02:41:23.760]  my body was missing out on this
[02:41:23.760 --> 02:41:24.760]  oh yeah everybody is
[02:41:24.760 --> 02:41:25.760]  I mean if you can't live
[02:41:25.760 --> 02:41:26.760]  a regular diet
[02:41:26.760 --> 02:41:27.760]  and live here in America
[02:41:27.760 --> 02:41:28.760]  and not be missing
[02:41:28.760 --> 02:41:29.760]  some of those
[02:41:29.760 --> 02:41:30.760]  90th century nutrients
[02:41:30.760 --> 02:41:31.760]  it's just impossible to do it
[02:41:31.760 --> 02:41:32.760]  I don't care if you're an athlete
[02:41:32.760 --> 02:41:33.760]  if you think you've got
[02:41:33.760 --> 02:41:34.760]  the best nutritionists
[02:41:34.760 --> 02:41:35.760]  and doctors and all this
[02:41:35.760 --> 02:41:36.760]  you'll be like the old rat
[02:41:36.760 --> 02:41:37.760]  that's falling apart
[02:41:37.760 --> 02:41:38.760]  with the best money positions
[02:41:38.760 --> 02:41:39.760]  and everything all around you
[02:41:39.760 --> 02:41:40.760]  daily
[02:41:40.760 --> 02:41:41.760]  and your body's falling apart
[02:41:41.760 --> 02:41:42.760]  so he saw the picture
[02:41:42.760 --> 02:41:43.760]  so everybody has in there
[02:41:43.760 --> 02:41:44.760]  I would just encourage him
[02:41:44.760 --> 02:41:45.760]  I take 90th century
[02:41:45.760 --> 02:41:46.760]  daily also
[02:41:46.760 --> 02:41:47.760]  I would just encourage him
[02:41:47.760 --> 02:41:48.760]  I take 90th century
[02:41:48.760 --> 02:41:49.760]  daily also
[02:41:49.760 --> 02:41:50.760]  I would just encourage him
[02:41:50.760 --> 02:41:51.760]  I take 90th century
[02:41:51.760 --> 02:41:52.760]  daily also
[02:41:52.760 --> 02:41:53.760]  and all of these former athletes
[02:41:53.760 --> 02:41:54.760]  Alex that I see
[02:41:54.760 --> 02:41:55.760]  and all the retired players
[02:41:55.760 --> 02:41:56.760]  meetings
[02:41:56.760 --> 02:41:57.760]  and all of these things
[02:41:57.760 --> 02:41:58.760]  so many hip replacements
[02:41:58.760 --> 02:41:59.760]  knee replacements
[02:41:59.760 --> 02:42:00.760]  and they're always asking me
[02:42:00.760 --> 02:42:01.760]  Mike isn't it hard for you
[02:42:01.760 --> 02:42:02.760]  to get up in the morning
[02:42:02.760 --> 02:42:03.760]  sometimes
[02:42:03.760 --> 02:42:04.760]  and no
[02:42:04.760 --> 02:42:05.760]  it's not hard for me
[02:42:05.760 --> 02:42:06.760]  to get up any more than at all
[02:42:06.760 --> 02:42:07.760]  you know
[02:42:07.760 --> 02:42:09.760]  I'm taking 90th century
[02:42:09.760 --> 02:42:10.760]  Listen Ted Anderson
[02:42:10.760 --> 02:42:11.760]  had been to three doctors
[02:42:11.760 --> 02:42:12.760]  he was going to have
[02:42:12.760 --> 02:42:13.760]  to have knee surgery
[02:42:13.760 --> 02:42:14.760]  when I'd go up to Minnesota
[02:42:14.760 --> 02:42:15.760]  the owner of this network
[02:42:15.760 --> 02:42:16.760]  we're on
[02:42:16.760 --> 02:42:17.760]  he would
[02:42:17.760 --> 02:42:18.760]  he would hobble around
[02:42:18.760 --> 02:42:19.760]  all over the place
[02:42:19.760 --> 02:42:20.760]  and then he went on
[02:42:20.760 --> 02:42:21.760]  all the longevity
[02:42:21.760 --> 02:42:22.760]  and the surgery
[02:42:22.760 --> 02:42:23.760]  isn't needed
[02:42:23.760 --> 02:42:24.760]  the pain is gone
[02:42:24.760 --> 02:42:25.760]  I mean
[02:42:25.760 --> 02:42:26.760]  break down
[02:42:26.760 --> 02:42:27.760]  from what you know
[02:42:27.760 --> 02:42:28.760]  from Dr. Wallach
[02:42:28.760 --> 02:42:29.760]  what are the
[02:42:29.760 --> 02:42:30.760]  what are the
[02:42:30.760 --> 02:42:31.760]  what are the vitamins
[02:42:31.760 --> 02:42:32.760]  and minerals doing
[02:42:32.760 --> 02:42:33.760]  and why won't the system
[02:42:33.760 --> 02:42:34.760]  tell people this
[02:42:34.760 --> 02:42:35.760]  because surely
[02:42:35.760 --> 02:42:36.760]  the system knows this as well
[02:42:36.760 --> 02:42:37.760]  I guess they want you to be sick
[02:42:37.760 --> 02:42:38.760]  so they can do surgery on you
[02:42:38.760 --> 02:42:39.760]  or what's going on
[02:42:39.760 --> 02:42:40.760]  Yeah well you're absolutely right
[02:42:40.760 --> 02:42:41.760]  there's
[02:42:41.760 --> 02:42:42.760]  as you know
[02:42:42.760 --> 02:42:43.760]  there's so much money
[02:42:43.760 --> 02:42:45.760]  in the pharmaceutical industry
[02:42:45.760 --> 02:42:46.760]  so many lobbyists
[02:42:46.760 --> 02:42:47.760]  so much money
[02:42:47.760 --> 02:42:48.760]  every commercial you see
[02:42:48.760 --> 02:42:50.760]  you're going to be totally inundated
[02:42:50.760 --> 02:42:51.760]  with all these
[02:42:51.760 --> 02:42:53.760]  messages and images
[02:42:53.760 --> 02:42:55.760]  of this is how you go to be healthy
[02:42:55.760 --> 02:42:56.760]  and anytime you hear something
[02:42:56.760 --> 02:42:57.760]  contrary to that
[02:42:57.760 --> 02:42:58.760]  you just automatically
[02:42:58.760 --> 02:42:59.760]  go against it
[02:42:59.760 --> 02:43:00.760]  I know
[02:43:00.760 --> 02:43:01.760]  that's not what I heard
[02:43:01.760 --> 02:43:02.760]  that's not what I saw
[02:43:02.760 --> 02:43:03.760]  so it takes a really
[02:43:03.760 --> 02:43:04.760]  open-minded person
[02:43:04.760 --> 02:43:06.760]  to empower themselves
[02:43:06.760 --> 02:43:07.760]  to have health
[02:43:07.760 --> 02:43:08.760]  and have a better life
[02:43:08.760 --> 02:43:09.760]  and that's the message
[02:43:09.760 --> 02:43:10.760]  of whether it's history
[02:43:10.760 --> 02:43:11.760]  or science
[02:43:11.760 --> 02:43:13.760]  or nutrition and health
[02:43:13.760 --> 02:43:14.760]  you have to empower yourself
[02:43:14.760 --> 02:43:15.760]  to make a change
[02:43:15.760 --> 02:43:17.760]  in your own life
[02:43:17.760 --> 02:43:18.760]  and so what happens
[02:43:18.760 --> 02:43:19.760]  to athletes
[02:43:19.760 --> 02:43:20.760]  Alex is
[02:43:20.760 --> 02:43:21.760]  we sweat out
[02:43:21.760 --> 02:43:22.760]  all of our nutrition
[02:43:22.760 --> 02:43:24.760]  at an accelerated pace
[02:43:24.760 --> 02:43:25.760]  so that's why
[02:43:25.760 --> 02:43:26.760]  we don't have calcium
[02:43:26.760 --> 02:43:27.760]  that's why our bones
[02:43:27.760 --> 02:43:28.760]  get brittle
[02:43:28.760 --> 02:43:29.760]  that's why they need
[02:43:29.760 --> 02:43:30.760]  so many knee replacements
[02:43:30.760 --> 02:43:31.760]  and hip replacements
[02:43:31.760 --> 02:43:32.760]  it's so common
[02:43:32.760 --> 02:43:33.760]  and then you have things
[02:43:33.760 --> 02:43:34.760]  from diabetes
[02:43:34.760 --> 02:43:35.760]  and other things
[02:43:35.760 --> 02:43:36.760]  because we sweat out
[02:43:36.760 --> 02:43:37.760]  daily
[02:43:37.760 --> 02:43:38.760]  from all the practice
[02:43:38.760 --> 02:43:39.760]  all the sweat
[02:43:39.760 --> 02:43:40.760]  we lose a soup of nutrients
[02:43:40.760 --> 02:43:41.760]  not just one
[02:43:41.760 --> 02:43:42.760]  you can't just take
[02:43:42.760 --> 02:43:43.760]  two or three nutrients
[02:43:43.760 --> 02:43:44.760]  and replace
[02:43:44.760 --> 02:43:45.760]  the whole soup
[02:43:45.760 --> 02:43:46.760]  that you're sweating out
[02:43:46.760 --> 02:43:47.760]  daily
[02:43:47.760 --> 02:43:48.760]  and so we have to
[02:43:48.760 --> 02:43:49.760]  get this message
[02:43:49.760 --> 02:43:50.760]  to athletes
[02:43:50.760 --> 02:43:51.760]  when they take it
[02:43:51.760 --> 02:43:52.760]  when they reveal
[02:43:52.760 --> 02:43:53.760]  we just do it
[02:43:53.760 --> 02:43:54.760]  at an accelerated pace
[02:43:54.760 --> 02:43:55.760]  everybody's gotta happen
[02:43:55.760 --> 02:43:56.760]  for everybody
[02:43:56.760 --> 02:43:57.760]  if you're losing
[02:43:57.760 --> 02:43:58.760]  your nutrients
[02:43:58.760 --> 02:43:59.760]  you're gonna have
[02:43:59.760 --> 02:44:00.760]  some kind of disease
[02:44:00.760 --> 02:44:01.760]  or illness
[02:44:01.760 --> 02:44:02.760]  as a result
[02:44:02.760 --> 02:44:03.760]  from it
[02:44:03.760 --> 02:44:04.760]  it's just a cause
[02:44:04.760 --> 02:44:05.760]  and effect situation
[02:44:05.760 --> 02:44:06.760]  so now we get
[02:44:06.760 --> 02:44:07.760]  a lot of athletes
[02:44:07.760 --> 02:44:08.760]  to understand that
[02:44:08.760 --> 02:44:09.760]  that you have to really
[02:44:09.760 --> 02:44:10.760]  so I have to take it
[02:44:10.760 --> 02:44:11.760]  twice a day
[02:44:11.760 --> 02:44:12.760]  I'm still working out
[02:44:12.760 --> 02:44:13.760]  I'm still maintaining
[02:44:13.760 --> 02:44:14.760]  I'm still very active
[02:44:14.760 --> 02:44:15.760]  I'm still
[02:44:15.760 --> 02:44:16.760]  I'm the analyst
[02:44:16.760 --> 02:44:17.760]  for the Atlanta Hawks
[02:44:17.760 --> 02:44:18.760]  and doing a lot of work
[02:44:18.760 --> 02:44:19.760]  like that
[02:44:19.760 --> 02:44:20.760]  so
[02:44:20.760 --> 02:44:21.760]  like Dr. Wallach
[02:44:21.760 --> 02:44:22.760]  man
[02:44:22.760 --> 02:44:23.760]  Doc is like
[02:44:23.760 --> 02:44:24.760]  the best athlete

[02:44:25.760 --> 02:44:26.760]  the only doctor

[02:44:30.760 --> 02:44:31.760]  on it
[02:44:31.760 --> 02:44:32.760]  and they're seeing
[02:44:32.760 --> 02:44:33.760]  the results
[02:44:33.760 --> 02:44:34.760]  by the way

[02:44:45.760 --> 02:44:46.760]  he looks in an accident

[02:48:51.760 --> 02:48:52.760]  father had created
[02:48:52.760 --> 02:48:53.760]  two sons that were

[02:48:54.760 --> 02:48:55.760]  baseball at a

[02:48:56.760 --> 02:48:57.760]  level so when you

[02:48:58.760 --> 02:48:59.760]  love that kind of
[02:48:59.760 --> 02:49:00.760]  support that kind of
[02:49:00.760 --> 02:49:01.760]  direction it can

[02:49:02.760 --> 02:49:03.760]  many wonderful
[02:49:03.760 --> 02:49:04.760]  things so we have
[02:49:04.760 --> 02:49:05.760]  to recognize that
[02:49:05.760 --> 02:49:06.760]  Alex we have to
[02:49:06.760 --> 02:49:07.760]  take care of
[02:49:07.760 --> 02:49:08.760]  these fathers and
[02:49:08.760 --> 02:49:09.760]  recognize these men
[02:49:09.760 --> 02:49:10.760]  and encourage others
[02:49:10.760 --> 02:49:11.760]  to do likewise
[02:49:11.760 --> 02:49:12.760]  there are countless
[02:49:12.760 --> 02:49:13.760]  examples around us
[02:49:13.760 --> 02:49:14.760]  we just don't
[02:49:14.760 --> 02:49:15.760]  always recognize
[02:49:15.760 --> 02:49:16.760]  them and pay
[02:49:16.760 --> 02:49:17.760]  homage to them for
[02:49:17.760 --> 02:49:18.760]  the outstanding
[02:49:18.760 --> 02:49:19.760]  work they do
[02:49:19.760 --> 02:49:20.760]  well sure I mean
[02:49:20.760 --> 02:49:21.760]  if you look at the
[02:49:21.760 --> 02:49:22.760]  collectivist and
[02:49:22.760 --> 02:49:23.760]  the socialist they
[02:49:23.760 --> 02:49:24.760]  want the state to be
[02:49:24.760 --> 02:49:25.760]  the dad I read a
[02:49:25.760 --> 02:49:26.760]  Hitler quote about
[02:49:26.760 --> 02:49:27.760]  that yesterday and
[02:49:27.760 --> 02:49:28.760]  they say if you build
[02:49:28.760 --> 02:49:29.760]  up fathers you're
[02:49:29.760 --> 02:49:30.760]  tearing down single
[02:49:30.760 --> 02:49:31.760]  mothers single
[02:49:31.760 --> 02:49:32.760]  mothers is some
[02:49:32.760 --> 02:49:33.760]  incredible stuff but
[02:49:33.760 --> 02:49:34.760]  you're four times
[02:49:34.760 --> 02:49:35.760]  more likely to end
[02:49:35.760 --> 02:49:36.760]  up in drugs or are in
[02:49:36.760 --> 02:49:37.760]  a state where the
[02:49:37.760 --> 02:49:38.760]  dad isn't there and
[02:49:38.760 --> 02:49:39.760]  so even if things
[02:49:39.760 --> 02:49:40.760]  aren't perfect it
[02:49:40.760 --> 02:49:41.760]  still doesn't matter
[02:49:41.760 --> 02:49:42.760]  having the dad there
[02:49:42.760 --> 02:49:43.760]  is what it's all
[02:49:43.760 --> 02:49:44.760]  about and we and
[02:49:44.760 --> 02:49:45.760]  it's like you know
[02:49:45.760 --> 02:49:46.760]  having four wheels on
[02:49:46.760 --> 02:49:47.760]  a car the dads too
[02:49:47.760 --> 02:49:48.760]  the moms too you've
[02:49:48.760 --> 02:49:49.760]  got to have those
[02:49:49.760 --> 02:49:50.760]  four wheels and
[02:49:50.760 --> 02:49:51.760]  that's why fatherhood
[02:49:51.760 --> 02:49:52.760]  is under assault and
[02:49:52.760 --> 02:49:53.760]  you just can't argue
[02:49:53.760 --> 02:49:54.760]  with the results of
[02:49:54.760 --> 02:49:55.760]  having a dad at
[02:49:55.760 --> 02:49:56.760]  home you're
[02:49:56.760 --> 02:49:57.760]  absolutely right man

[02:49:58.760 --> 02:49:59.760]  is an assault on him
[02:49:59.760 --> 02:50:00.760]  I mean I even see
[02:50:00.760 --> 02:50:01.760]  cases in society I'm
[02:50:01.760 --> 02:50:02.760]  very much familiar
[02:50:02.760 --> 02:50:03.760]  with you saw Michael
[02:50:03.760 --> 02:50:04.760]  Jackson's there they
[02:50:04.760 --> 02:50:05.760]  will always be
[02:50:05.760 --> 02:50:06.760]  kind of negative he
[02:50:06.760 --> 02:50:07.760]  was too hard on
[02:50:07.760 --> 02:50:08.760]  Michael this than the
[02:50:08.760 --> 02:50:09.760]  other he created the
[02:50:09.760 --> 02:50:10.760]  greatest figure group
[02:50:10.760 --> 02:50:11.760]  baby is in the world

[02:50:12.760 --> 02:50:13.760]  tremendous thing and
[02:50:13.760 --> 02:50:14.760]  you look at Venus and
[02:50:14.760 --> 02:50:15.760]  Serena and what their
[02:50:15.760 --> 02:50:16.760]  dad who had this
[02:50:16.760 --> 02:50:17.760]  dream that he could
[02:50:17.760 --> 02:50:18.760]  raise two daughters
[02:50:18.760 --> 02:50:19.760]  that could be great
[02:50:19.760 --> 02:50:20.760]  tennis players and he
[02:50:20.760 --> 02:50:21.760]  went about doing it
[02:50:21.760 --> 02:50:22.760]  from looking at a video
[02:50:22.760 --> 02:50:23.760]  so there are tremendous
[02:50:23.760 --> 02:50:24.760]  things that these

[02:50:25.760 --> 02:50:26.760]  they're always people
[02:50:26.760 --> 02:50:27.760]  trying to put them down
[02:50:27.760 --> 02:50:28.760]  so I totally agree

[02:54:43.760 --> 02:54:44.760]  Elephants
[02:54:44.760 --> 02:54:46.760]  I've seen this on TV
[02:54:46.760 --> 02:54:47.760]  In Africa they'll reach
[02:54:47.760 --> 02:54:48.760]  with their trunks
[02:54:48.760 --> 02:54:49.760]  way down into the mud
[02:54:49.760 --> 02:54:51.760]  and find the minerals
[02:54:51.760 --> 02:54:52.760]  and eat them
[02:54:52.760 --> 02:54:53.760]  And you'll see deer
[02:54:53.760 --> 02:54:55.760]  go up to certain rock formations
[02:54:55.760 --> 02:54:56.760]  and they just sit there
[02:54:56.760 --> 02:54:59.760]  eating, chewing on rocks
[02:54:59.760 --> 02:55:00.760]  And you're like
[02:55:00.760 --> 02:55:01.760]  oh the deer are crazy
[02:55:01.760 --> 02:55:03.760]  No, their body knows
[02:55:03.760 --> 02:55:05.760]  it needs minerals
[02:55:05.760 --> 02:55:07.760]  And the old timers
[02:55:07.760 --> 02:55:08.760]  and this has just gotten
[02:55:08.760 --> 02:55:09.760]  bigger the last decade
[02:55:09.760 --> 02:55:10.760]  You can get it in Himalayan salt
[02:55:10.760 --> 02:55:11.760]  some of the trace stuff
[02:55:11.760 --> 02:55:13.760]  You can also get it
[02:55:13.760 --> 02:55:15.760]  in some of the clays
[02:55:15.760 --> 02:55:16.760]  But the old timers
[02:55:16.760 --> 02:55:17.760]  across the board knew
[02:55:17.760 --> 02:55:18.760]  especially when women
[02:55:18.760 --> 02:55:19.760]  were pregnant
[02:55:19.760 --> 02:55:20.760]  that you were supposed
[02:55:20.760 --> 02:55:21.760]  to eat clay
[02:55:21.760 --> 02:55:22.760]  People go
[02:55:22.760 --> 02:55:23.760]  oh look at the old timers
[02:55:23.760 --> 02:55:24.760]  eating clay, they're crazy
[02:55:24.760 --> 02:55:25.760]  It's the real
[02:55:25.760 --> 02:55:26.760]  wide spectrum minerals
[02:55:26.760 --> 02:55:27.760]  And I'm done plugging that
[02:55:27.760 --> 02:55:30.760]  We're back on fathers
[02:55:30.760 --> 02:55:31.760]  with the stinger
[02:55:31.760 --> 02:55:32.760]  Mike Glenn
[02:55:32.760 --> 02:55:33.760]  Mike, finish up your point
[02:55:33.760 --> 02:55:34.760]  about the guy that was homeless
[02:55:34.760 --> 02:55:36.760]  Yes, Derek Anderson
[02:55:36.760 --> 02:55:38.760]  Derek Anderson was
[02:55:38.760 --> 02:55:39.760]  a homeless young man
[02:55:39.760 --> 02:55:41.760]  and he had a son
[02:55:41.760 --> 02:55:43.760]  And at 15
[02:55:43.760 --> 02:55:45.760]  he worked two jobs
[02:55:45.760 --> 02:55:47.760]  to raise this one-year-old son
[02:55:47.760 --> 02:55:48.760]  And often he would
[02:55:48.760 --> 02:55:49.760]  sleep in the gym
[02:55:49.760 --> 02:55:51.760]  But he was so determined
[02:55:51.760 --> 02:55:52.760]  to be a success
[02:55:52.760 --> 02:55:54.760]  Practice ball, got a scholarship
[02:55:54.760 --> 02:55:56.760]  Went to University of Kentucky
[02:55:56.760 --> 02:55:58.760]  Won a national championship
[02:55:58.760 --> 02:56:00.760]  Played in the NBA
[02:56:00.760 --> 02:56:02.760]  And that gym that he slept in
[02:56:02.760 --> 02:56:03.760]  from being homeless
[02:56:03.760 --> 02:56:04.760]  as a 15-year-old
[02:56:04.760 --> 02:56:06.760]  is now named after him
[02:56:06.760 --> 02:56:08.760]  And his one-year-old son
[02:56:08.760 --> 02:56:10.760]  that he was taken care of
[02:56:10.760 --> 02:56:11.760]  now works with him
[02:56:11.760 --> 02:56:13.760]  as an adult in his business
[02:56:13.760 --> 02:56:14.760]  And this is the kind of
[02:56:14.760 --> 02:56:17.760]  example that the father can be
[02:56:17.760 --> 02:56:18.760]  And I see it oftentimes
[02:56:18.760 --> 02:56:20.760]  and we don't hear about it
[02:56:20.760 --> 02:56:21.760]  He's the kind of person
[02:56:21.760 --> 02:56:23.760]  that comes to my camp
[02:56:23.760 --> 02:56:24.760]  that tells my deaf kids
[02:56:24.760 --> 02:56:26.760]  that they can be successful
[02:56:26.760 --> 02:56:27.760]  And he's an example
[02:56:27.760 --> 02:56:28.760]  of that fatherhood
[02:56:28.760 --> 02:56:30.760]  starting at age 15
[02:56:30.760 --> 02:56:32.760]  in those kind of circumstances
[02:56:32.760 --> 02:56:33.760]  to be a tremendous success
[02:56:33.760 --> 02:56:35.760]  National championship
[02:56:35.760 --> 02:56:36.760]  NBA champ
[02:56:36.760 --> 02:56:37.760]  Olympian champ
[02:56:37.760 --> 02:56:38.760]  Derek Anderson
[02:56:38.760 --> 02:56:40.760]  So outstanding young man
[02:56:40.760 --> 02:56:41.760]  with a new book called
[02:56:41.760 --> 02:56:42.760]  Stamina
[02:56:42.760 --> 02:56:43.760]  And I just wanted to
[02:56:43.760 --> 02:56:44.760]  praise him as well
[02:56:44.760 --> 02:56:46.760]  since you mentioned fatherhood
[02:56:46.760 --> 02:56:47.760]  and what a tremendous father
[02:56:47.760 --> 02:56:50.760]  he was and is to his son
[02:56:50.760 --> 02:56:51.760]  Well it was Hitler that said
[02:56:51.760 --> 02:56:54.760]  first you've got the women
[02:56:54.760 --> 02:56:55.760]  first you get the women
[02:56:55.760 --> 02:56:56.760]  then you've got the children
[02:56:56.760 --> 02:56:57.760]  so follow the men
[02:56:57.760 --> 02:56:58.760]  And socialists,
[02:56:58.760 --> 02:57:00.760]  authoritarians, fascists
[02:57:00.760 --> 02:57:04.760]  always target the children
[02:57:04.760 --> 02:57:05.760]  and the women
[02:57:05.760 --> 02:57:06.760]  and try to remove men
[02:57:06.760 --> 02:57:07.760]  out of the equation
[02:57:07.760 --> 02:57:08.760]  And we're seeing that
[02:57:08.760 --> 02:57:09.760]  happening today
[02:57:09.760 --> 02:57:10.760]  And that's why
[02:57:10.760 --> 02:57:11.760]  the work you're doing
[02:57:11.760 --> 02:57:12.760]  Mike Glenn
[02:57:12.760 --> 02:57:13.760]  MikeGlenn.com
[02:57:13.760 --> 02:57:14.760]  The Stinger NBA legend
[02:57:14.760 --> 02:57:15.760]  Thank you so much
[02:57:15.760 --> 02:57:16.760]  for your time
[02:57:16.760 --> 02:57:17.760]  And I look forward
[02:57:17.760 --> 02:57:18.760]  to speaking to you again
[02:57:18.760 --> 02:57:19.760]  And if you ever come through
[02:57:19.760 --> 02:57:20.760]  town in Austin
[02:57:20.760 --> 02:57:21.760]  I'd love to get you in studio
[02:57:21.760 --> 02:57:22.760]  I will certainly do that
[02:57:22.760 --> 02:57:23.760]  Alex I appreciate you
[02:57:23.760 --> 02:57:24.760]  greatly as well now
[02:57:24.760 --> 02:57:25.760]  You take care
[02:57:25.760 --> 02:57:26.760]  All the best to you
[02:57:26.760 --> 02:57:27.760]  You too
[02:57:27.760 --> 02:57:28.760]  Take care folks
[02:57:28.760 --> 02:57:29.760]  There goes Mike Glenn
[02:57:29.760 --> 02:57:31.760]  And he's got some big dogs
[02:57:31.760 --> 02:57:32.760]  there in the background
[02:57:32.760 --> 02:57:34.760]  Let him take care of those
[02:57:34.760 --> 02:57:36.760]  I'm going to go into overdrive
[02:57:36.760 --> 02:57:39.760]  Antonio Beeler
[02:57:39.760 --> 02:57:40.760]  You remember about a year ago
[02:57:40.760 --> 02:57:41.760]  got arrested filming
[02:57:41.760 --> 02:57:42.760]  the cops in Austin
[02:57:42.760 --> 02:57:43.760]  No criminal record
[02:57:43.760 --> 02:57:44.760]  West Point grad
[02:57:44.760 --> 02:57:45.760]  The point is
[02:57:45.760 --> 02:57:46.760]  is that good people
[02:57:46.760 --> 02:57:48.760]  that aren't like criminals
[02:57:48.760 --> 02:57:49.760]  are now caught up
[02:57:49.760 --> 02:57:50.760]  in the system all the time
[02:57:50.760 --> 02:57:51.760]  Veterans are having
[02:57:51.760 --> 02:57:52.760]  their kids taken
[02:57:52.760 --> 02:57:53.760]  for no reason
[02:57:53.760 --> 02:57:54.760]  And if they can go after
[02:57:54.760 --> 02:57:56.760]  veterans and people
[02:57:56.760 --> 02:57:58.760]  the sky is the limit
[02:57:58.760 --> 02:57:59.760]  And a Travis County
[02:57:59.760 --> 02:58:00.760]  grand jury indicted him
[02:58:00.760 --> 02:58:03.760]  last week
[02:58:03.760 --> 02:58:04.760]  for filming the police
[02:58:04.760 --> 02:58:05.760]  And Ardey Saaveda
[02:58:05.760 --> 02:58:06.760]  the police chief said
[02:58:06.760 --> 02:58:07.760]  well you can film police
[02:58:07.760 --> 02:58:09.760]  you can't interfere
[02:58:09.760 --> 02:58:10.760]  Well there happens
[02:58:10.760 --> 02:58:11.760]  to be footage
[02:58:11.760 --> 02:58:12.760]  of what happened
[02:58:12.760 --> 02:58:13.760]  Not just from his camera
[02:58:13.760 --> 02:58:14.760]  but from across the street
[02:58:14.760 --> 02:58:15.760]  He's filming the cops
[02:58:15.760 --> 02:58:16.760]  They stop that
[02:58:16.760 --> 02:58:17.760]  He's backing up
[02:58:17.760 --> 02:58:18.760]  and the cops start
[02:58:18.760 --> 02:58:19.760]  going at him
[02:58:19.760 --> 02:58:20.760]  and he says
[02:58:20.760 --> 02:58:21.760]  What are you doing?
[02:58:21.760 --> 02:58:22.760]  What are you doing?
[02:58:22.760 --> 02:58:24.760]  And so he hasn't arrived yet
[02:58:24.760 --> 02:58:25.760]  but we'll
[02:58:25.760 --> 02:58:26.760]  Oh he is here?
[02:58:26.760 --> 02:58:27.760]  He is here
[02:58:27.760 --> 02:58:28.760]  Okay good
[02:58:28.760 --> 02:58:29.760]  He just got here
[02:58:29.760 --> 02:58:30.760]  right on time
[02:58:30.760 --> 02:58:31.760]  So what's going to happen is
[02:58:31.760 --> 02:58:32.760]  I'm going to take your calls
[02:58:32.760 --> 02:58:33.760]  for a couple segments
[02:58:33.760 --> 02:58:34.760]  while we get this set up
[02:58:34.760 --> 02:58:35.760]  that he's going to be coming in
[02:58:35.760 --> 02:58:36.760]  We're going into overdrive

[03:00:17.760 --> 03:00:19.760]  live from Austin, Texas
[03:00:19.760 --> 03:00:21.760]  Alex Jones
[03:00:28.760 --> 03:00:29.760]  Alright folks
[03:00:29.760 --> 03:00:31.760]  We're going to have Antonio Beeler
[03:00:31.760 --> 03:00:33.760]  who's here in studio
[03:00:33.760 --> 03:00:34.760]  If you're watching on TV
[03:00:34.760 --> 03:00:36.760]  here's the new issue of our magazine
[03:00:36.760 --> 03:00:37.760]  Look right here
[03:00:37.760 --> 03:00:38.760]  People didn't believe this
[03:00:38.760 --> 03:00:39.760]  when I first reported it
[03:00:39.760 --> 03:00:41.760]  because I was down at the Texas coast
[03:00:41.760 --> 03:00:43.760]  and my crew was being given tickets
[03:00:43.760 --> 03:00:44.760]  and threatened with arrest
[03:00:44.760 --> 03:00:46.760]  and they handed out magazines anywhere downtown
[03:00:46.760 --> 03:00:48.760]  It was so outrageous
[03:00:48.760 --> 03:00:50.760]  listeners didn't believe me
[03:00:50.760 --> 03:00:52.760]  until I got back up here
[03:00:52.760 --> 03:00:54.760]  and showed the photos and the video online
[03:00:54.760 --> 03:00:56.760]  Like I'm going to make this up
[03:00:56.760 --> 03:00:58.760]  I mean sometimes I get stuff wrong folks
[03:00:58.760 --> 03:01:00.760]  or I flip numbers around
[03:01:00.760 --> 03:01:02.760]  or say somebody's name wrong
[03:01:02.760 --> 03:01:04.760]  I almost said Patrick Douglas earlier
[03:01:04.760 --> 03:01:06.760]  I know it's Frederick Douglas
[03:01:06.760 --> 03:01:08.760]  but I mean there it is
[03:01:08.760 --> 03:01:09.760]  getting the ticket
[03:01:09.760 --> 03:01:10.760]  in America
[03:01:10.760 --> 03:01:12.760]  So we're going to be talking to him
[03:01:12.760 --> 03:01:14.760]  He's now been indicted
[03:01:14.760 --> 03:01:16.760]  for filming police in Austin
[03:01:16.760 --> 03:01:18.760]  I mean super creepville
[03:01:18.760 --> 03:01:19.760]  And the average cops in Austin
[03:01:19.760 --> 03:01:20.760]  I'm in all over the country
[03:01:20.760 --> 03:01:21.760]  are pretty nice overall
[03:01:21.760 --> 03:01:22.760]  Doesn't matter
[03:01:22.760 --> 03:01:24.760]  They're being given orders and policies
[03:01:24.760 --> 03:01:25.760]  that are out of control
[03:01:25.760 --> 03:01:27.760]  Let's go ahead and take some calls
[03:01:27.760 --> 03:01:28.760]  in this segment and the next
[03:01:28.760 --> 03:01:30.760]  and Antonio Beeler's going to be in studio with us
[03:01:30.760 --> 03:01:32.760]  Daniel in Kentucky
[03:01:32.760 --> 03:01:33.760]  Thanks for holding brother
[03:01:33.760 --> 03:01:34.760]  You're on the air
[03:01:34.760 --> 03:01:35.760]  Go ahead
[03:01:35.760 --> 03:01:38.760]  Alex, thanks for taking my call
[03:01:38.760 --> 03:01:40.760]  The socialists and communists
[03:01:40.760 --> 03:01:41.760]  in the world
[03:01:41.760 --> 03:01:42.760]  They want everything we've got
[03:01:42.760 --> 03:01:43.760]  They want our money
[03:01:43.760 --> 03:01:45.760]  They want your silver and gold
[03:01:45.760 --> 03:01:47.760]  They want of course your guns
[03:01:47.760 --> 03:01:48.760]  And as we heard
[03:01:48.760 --> 03:01:51.760]  I just realized it's the slaver media
[03:01:51.760 --> 03:01:53.760]  That's why they always talk about black slavery all day
[03:01:53.760 --> 03:01:55.760]  because I don't want you to recognize the current slaver
[03:01:55.760 --> 03:01:57.760]  The globalists are slavers
[03:01:57.760 --> 03:01:58.760]  They fit the definition
[03:01:58.760 --> 03:01:59.760]  I'm going to do a piece on that
[03:01:59.760 --> 03:02:01.760]  They are slavers
[03:02:01.760 --> 03:02:02.760]  But they have fancy propaganda
[03:02:02.760 --> 03:02:03.760]  Go ahead
[03:02:03.760 --> 03:02:05.760]  The most precious thing you have
[03:02:05.760 --> 03:02:06.760]  is your children
[03:02:06.760 --> 03:02:08.760]  And they've admitted that
[03:02:08.760 --> 03:02:09.760]  That's what they want too
[03:02:09.760 --> 03:02:11.760]  And I think we have a president
[03:02:11.760 --> 03:02:12.760]  that is looking for a crisis
[03:02:12.760 --> 03:02:14.760]  I don't know if they want to do this
[03:02:14.760 --> 03:02:15.760]  over a period of time
[03:02:15.760 --> 03:02:16.760]  No, no, they're trying to start a civil war
[03:02:16.760 --> 03:02:17.760]  Everybody agrees
[03:02:17.760 --> 03:02:19.760]  And you know, there's four crisis areas
[03:02:19.760 --> 03:02:22.760]  Maybe this North Korea thing
[03:02:22.760 --> 03:02:24.760]  Maybe he's hoping something happens there
[03:02:24.760 --> 03:02:27.760]  I think it could be the financial state
[03:02:27.760 --> 03:02:28.760]  of our country
[03:02:28.760 --> 03:02:31.760]  We're 16, what, 17 trillion dollars in debt
[03:02:31.760 --> 03:02:34.760]  And Ben Bernanke back years ago
[03:02:34.760 --> 03:02:35.760]  gave a speech
[03:02:35.760 --> 03:02:37.760]  And he said in a financial crisis
[03:02:37.760 --> 03:02:38.760]  he would do certain things
[03:02:38.760 --> 03:02:41.760]  He would bring the interest rates down to zero
[03:02:41.760 --> 03:02:43.760]  He would pump money into the economy
[03:02:43.760 --> 03:02:45.760]  He would let the government buy securities
[03:02:45.760 --> 03:02:47.760]  the Federal Reserve buy securities
[03:02:47.760 --> 03:02:50.760]  One thing that he said that has not been done yet
[03:02:50.760 --> 03:02:52.760]  is devaluing the currency
[03:02:52.760 --> 03:02:54.760]  And I think that's how they're going to
[03:02:54.760 --> 03:02:56.760]  If they're going to pay the debt back
[03:02:56.760 --> 03:02:57.760]  that's how they're going to do it
[03:02:57.760 --> 03:02:59.760]  Oh, there's no doubt they're already doing it
[03:02:59.760 --> 03:03:00.760]  It's just that
[03:03:00.760 --> 03:03:03.760]  It's like a couple pieces of the cake have been taken out
[03:03:03.760 --> 03:03:04.760]  But soon to be the whole cake
[03:03:04.760 --> 03:03:08.760]  And they're just going to absolutely wreck people's savings and future
[03:03:08.760 --> 03:03:11.760]  Which again will force us on to welfare
[03:03:11.760 --> 03:03:12.760]  Which is the goal
[03:03:12.760 --> 03:03:14.760]  You're absolutely right, sir
[03:03:14.760 --> 03:03:16.760]  Another thing I want to make a comment about GMOs
[03:03:16.760 --> 03:03:19.760]  It's through your program and Mike Adams
[03:03:19.760 --> 03:03:20.760]  and Natural News
[03:03:20.760 --> 03:03:22.760]  that my wife and I have learned about GMOs
[03:03:22.760 --> 03:03:24.760]  and the dangers of them
[03:03:24.760 --> 03:03:25.760]  And I'll tell you a little story
[03:03:25.760 --> 03:03:26.760]  Back in the fall
[03:03:26.760 --> 03:03:30.760]  I took my wife in for a heart catheterization test
[03:03:30.760 --> 03:03:32.760]  And I had a book with me
[03:03:32.760 --> 03:03:33.760]  that I was going to read
[03:03:33.760 --> 03:03:34.760]  while I was waiting
[03:03:34.760 --> 03:03:35.760]  called Seeds of Deception
[03:03:35.760 --> 03:03:37.760]  by Jeffrey Smith
[03:03:37.760 --> 03:03:38.760]  No, no, we sell it
[03:03:38.760 --> 03:03:39.760]  Yeah, go ahead
[03:03:39.760 --> 03:03:42.760]  Anyway, the doctor and his nurse
[03:03:42.760 --> 03:03:43.760]  the cardiologist and his nurse
[03:03:43.760 --> 03:03:44.760]  was going to come in
[03:03:44.760 --> 03:03:46.760]  and talk to us before the procedure
[03:03:46.760 --> 03:03:48.760]  And I didn't have it with me
[03:03:48.760 --> 03:03:49.760]  I had it on the little desk
[03:03:49.760 --> 03:03:51.760]  by where we were sitting
[03:03:51.760 --> 03:03:52.760]  And he looks over and he said
[03:03:52.760 --> 03:03:53.760]  Seeds of Deception
[03:03:53.760 --> 03:03:54.760]  What's that about?
[03:03:54.760 --> 03:03:56.760]  And so he listened to me
[03:03:56.760 --> 03:03:57.760]  for about three minutes
[03:03:57.760 --> 03:03:59.760]  tell him the dangers of GMOs
[03:03:59.760 --> 03:04:02.760]  and how the FDA released that
[03:04:02.760 --> 03:04:04.760]  into our system
[03:04:04.760 --> 03:04:06.760]  back in 95 and 96
[03:04:06.760 --> 03:04:07.760]  without proper testing
[03:04:07.760 --> 03:04:10.760]  And so he was really concerned about that
[03:04:10.760 --> 03:04:14.760]  So I think we need to tell the Infowars warriors
[03:04:14.760 --> 03:04:15.760]  to talk to people
[03:04:15.760 --> 03:04:16.760]  Oh yeah, listen, listen
[03:04:16.760 --> 03:04:17.760]  there are a lot of smart people
[03:04:17.760 --> 03:04:19.760]  but they went to college
[03:04:19.760 --> 03:04:20.760]  went to math
[03:04:20.760 --> 03:04:22.760]  went and got their PhD or their doctorate
[03:04:22.760 --> 03:04:25.760]  and they've always been so focused on the system
[03:04:25.760 --> 03:04:27.760]  now they're paying off their college bills
[03:04:27.760 --> 03:04:30.760]  now they're trying to raise their kids
[03:04:30.760 --> 03:04:31.760]  now they're trying to get
[03:04:31.760 --> 03:04:33.760]  you know, home
[03:04:33.760 --> 03:04:35.760]  to go visit grandma
[03:04:35.760 --> 03:04:36.760]  and before you know it
[03:04:36.760 --> 03:04:37.760]  you're 80 years old and you're dead
[03:04:37.760 --> 03:04:38.760]  meanwhile the globalists
[03:04:38.760 --> 03:04:40.760]  have just got all the time in the world
[03:04:40.760 --> 03:04:41.760]  social engineering
[03:04:41.760 --> 03:04:42.760]  we need to become aware of it
[03:04:42.760 --> 03:04:44.760]  but the fact that they'd come out and say
[03:04:44.760 --> 03:04:46.760]  your children belong to the state
[03:04:46.760 --> 03:04:47.760]  you can see the article up at
[03:04:47.760 --> 03:04:48.760]  drugsreport.com
[03:04:48.760 --> 03:04:49.760]  it's on the left hand side
[03:04:49.760 --> 03:04:51.760]  shows you how crazy these people are
[03:04:51.760 --> 03:04:53.760]  Alright, I'm going to do the whole hour

[03:07:08.760 --> 03:07:10.760]  President Ronald Reagan
[03:07:10.760 --> 03:07:11.760]  requested that Carnivora
[03:07:11.760 --> 03:07:13.760]  be sent directly to the White House
[03:07:13.760 --> 03:07:14.760]  at a time when only the President
[03:07:14.760 --> 03:07:16.760]  could obtain this world class healer
[03:07:16.760 --> 03:07:17.760]  now

[03:08:40.760 --> 03:08:44.760]  experiencing an erection of collectivism
[03:08:44.760 --> 03:08:45.760]  lasting 4 hours
[03:08:45.760 --> 03:08:47.760]  stop watching MSNBC
[03:08:47.760 --> 03:08:49.760]  that's a funny John Rapoport headline
[03:08:49.760 --> 03:08:51.760]  Ron Paul
[03:08:51.760 --> 03:08:53.760]  launches homeschooling program
[03:08:53.760 --> 03:08:55.760]  my wife wants to use it
[03:08:55.760 --> 03:08:56.760]  he's not even a sponsor yet
[03:08:56.760 --> 03:08:57.760]  but I will get him
[03:08:57.760 --> 03:09:01.760]  MSNBC hosts your kids belong to the collective
[03:09:01.760 --> 03:09:04.760]  we've reposted that article that's up on Drudge right now
[03:09:04.760 --> 03:09:06.760]  it is necessary and proper for the feds
[03:09:06.760 --> 03:09:09.760]  to regulate US citizens from cradle to grave
[03:09:09.760 --> 03:09:11.760]  Bilderberg 2013
[03:09:11.760 --> 03:09:13.760]  probably England, possibly Germany
[03:09:13.760 --> 03:09:15.760]  breaking news there
[03:09:15.760 --> 03:09:17.760]  Senator McCain says
[03:09:17.760 --> 03:09:19.760]  he doesn't understand an effort to protect the second amendment
[03:09:19.760 --> 03:09:21.760]  I mean it's just the bill of rights get rid of it
[03:09:21.760 --> 03:09:23.760]  new DARPA robot looks like a human
[03:09:23.760 --> 03:09:25.760]  ATF to spy on gun owners
[03:09:25.760 --> 03:09:27.760]  via massive database
[03:09:27.760 --> 03:09:29.760]  so I can finally relax into the fourth hour here
[03:09:29.760 --> 03:09:31.760]  I was so angry today
[03:09:31.760 --> 03:09:34.760]  just so pent up over what's going on
[03:09:34.760 --> 03:09:35.760]  because I'm an extremist
[03:09:35.760 --> 03:09:37.760]  that I can barely even do the show
[03:09:37.760 --> 03:09:38.760]  let's take a few calls
[03:09:38.760 --> 03:09:40.760]  and we've got our guest here in studio
[03:09:40.760 --> 03:09:42.760]  not only can you not hand out magazines
[03:09:42.760 --> 03:09:44.760]  or have an Infoworks bumper sticker in Austin
[03:09:44.760 --> 03:09:47.760]  according to South by Southwest
[03:09:47.760 --> 03:09:48.760]  that command the police
[03:09:48.760 --> 03:09:50.760]  you cannot film police now
[03:09:50.760 --> 03:09:53.760]  so they're not going to like 300,000 bumper stickers
[03:09:53.760 --> 03:09:55.760]  they're going to be in the next magazine
[03:09:55.760 --> 03:10:00.760]  that's 300,000 they're going to be hitting the streets in Austin
[03:10:00.760 --> 03:10:02.760]  to be posted in legal and lawful areas
[03:10:02.760 --> 03:10:04.760]  like on your own private property
[03:10:04.760 --> 03:10:06.760]  but that's my answer
[03:10:06.760 --> 03:10:08.760]  you don't like it take this
[03:10:08.760 --> 03:10:11.760]  if you give me a problem it'll be a million next
[03:10:11.760 --> 03:10:15.760]  okay let's go to Terry in Florida
[03:10:15.760 --> 03:10:16.760]  you're on the air
[03:10:16.760 --> 03:10:18.760]  we're not going to be pushed around anymore folks
[03:10:18.760 --> 03:10:20.760]  Terry you're on the air welcome
[03:10:20.760 --> 03:10:22.760]  hey Alex thanks for having me
[03:10:22.760 --> 03:10:24.760]  thank you for holding brother go ahead
[03:10:24.760 --> 03:10:25.760]  God bless you
[03:10:25.760 --> 03:10:28.760]  I have ordered some magazines a week ago
[03:10:28.760 --> 03:10:31.760]  you guys sent me so many more than I ordered
[03:10:31.760 --> 03:10:33.760]  and I appreciate it
[03:10:33.760 --> 03:10:36.760]  and I have my fiancé passed them in school
[03:10:36.760 --> 03:10:39.760]  she works at a school down there in the college
[03:10:39.760 --> 03:10:40.760]  she's passing them out
[03:10:40.760 --> 03:10:42.760]  well let me give you a secret
[03:10:42.760 --> 03:10:44.760]  we get thrills
[03:10:44.760 --> 03:10:46.760]  like Johnny Appleseed planted appleseeds
[03:10:46.760 --> 03:10:48.760]  and Santa Claus brings presents
[03:10:48.760 --> 03:10:50.760]  we like spreading info around
[03:10:50.760 --> 03:10:52.760]  that's what we're looking for
[03:10:52.760 --> 03:10:55.760]  that's what floats our boat that Marilyn Monroe sorry
[03:10:55.760 --> 03:10:57.760]  I'm doing the job trust me
[03:10:57.760 --> 03:10:58.760]  I do everything I could
[03:10:58.760 --> 03:11:01.760]  I even write it down with markers everywhere I go
[03:11:01.760 --> 03:11:03.760]  to inform people about it
[03:11:03.760 --> 03:11:05.760]  and I like the job that you do
[03:11:05.760 --> 03:11:09.760]  and the thing I call about is the tax hike
[03:11:09.760 --> 03:11:12.760]  that Obama put in right now
[03:11:12.760 --> 03:11:14.760]  I'm making a $1,200 check
[03:11:14.760 --> 03:11:17.760]  and they take like 400 plus dollars out of it
[03:11:17.760 --> 03:11:19.760]  and I'm forced to get insurance
[03:11:19.760 --> 03:11:22.760]  and my tax preparer told me
[03:11:22.760 --> 03:11:24.760]  if I didn't have insurance next year
[03:11:24.760 --> 03:11:29.760]  I would have to pay a $400 plus penalty
[03:11:29.760 --> 03:11:32.760]  yeah actually I think that's going to be every month or so
[03:11:32.760 --> 03:11:34.760]  it's $5,000 a year penalty
[03:11:34.760 --> 03:11:37.760]  depending and they got some waiver where it's only $2,000
[03:11:37.760 --> 03:11:39.760]  it doubles the premiums already this year
[03:11:39.760 --> 03:11:41.760]  it's meant to bankrupt everything
[03:11:41.760 --> 03:11:44.760]  and of course payroll tax went up for poorest Americans
[03:11:44.760 --> 03:11:46.760]  I mean it's just brutal
[03:11:46.760 --> 03:11:50.760]  but again only fascism with a collectivist bent
[03:11:50.760 --> 03:11:52.760]  fascism generally is collectivist at the grassroots
[03:11:52.760 --> 03:11:54.760]  it could only come with a fake liberal
[03:11:54.760 --> 03:11:55.760]  with a peace prize
[03:11:55.760 --> 03:11:57.760]  it's all part of a sick joke
[03:11:57.760 --> 03:11:59.760]  psy-op that's going on
[03:11:59.760 --> 03:12:01.760]  so Terry good to hear from you thanks for holding
[03:12:01.760 --> 03:12:05.760]  Shirlia in Alaska you're on the air welcome
[03:12:05.760 --> 03:12:08.760]  Hi my name is Shirlia
[03:12:08.760 --> 03:12:10.760]  Shirlia very pretty name
[03:12:10.760 --> 03:12:14.760]  hey I'm from I'm a redneck from Texas man I can hardly talk
[03:12:14.760 --> 03:12:17.760]  I love it but I went there actually twice
[03:12:17.760 --> 03:12:20.760]  well listen you're on the air go ahead
[03:12:20.760 --> 03:12:23.760]  and talk about everything you were talking about earlier
[03:12:23.760 --> 03:12:26.760]  fathers are important because
[03:12:26.760 --> 03:12:30.760]  a house divided cannot stand and that's exactly what they're doing
[03:12:30.760 --> 03:12:34.760]  and that's really sad because I didn't grow up a lot of father
[03:12:34.760 --> 03:12:38.760]  and went through all the hardships so that was true
[03:12:38.760 --> 03:12:42.760]  and then nutrition is true when you're talking about people eating clay
[03:12:42.760 --> 03:12:46.760]  it's a thing called Pica and it's where people have
[03:12:46.760 --> 03:12:52.760]  like mineral deficiencies and they'll start eating things that aren't food
[03:12:52.760 --> 03:12:56.760]  yeah that's what animals do from squirrels to grizzly bears
[03:12:56.760 --> 03:13:00.760]  that's what they do but again that's because they're extremist conspiracy theorists
[03:13:00.760 --> 03:13:04.760]  and so that's why we promote the longevity products at m4shealth.com
[03:13:04.760 --> 03:13:07.760]  because being healthy is a revolution against these tyrants
[03:13:07.760 --> 03:13:09.760]  thank you so much for the call
[03:13:09.760 --> 03:13:13.760]  let's talk to Solomon in Colorado
[03:13:13.760 --> 03:13:16.760]  where the state rep there believes that clips are disposable
[03:13:16.760 --> 03:13:20.760]  so you have to get rid of the ban the clips so that there aren't any more clips out there
[03:13:20.760 --> 03:13:23.760]  I mean that does give us an idea about our enemy folks
[03:13:23.760 --> 03:13:25.760]  they are dumber than dirt
[03:13:25.760 --> 03:13:27.760]  go ahead you're on the air
[03:13:27.760 --> 03:13:30.760]  hey Alex thanks for taking my phone call
[03:13:30.760 --> 03:13:34.760]  good fan of yours man appreciate what you do
[03:13:34.760 --> 03:13:35.760]  thank you
[03:13:35.760 --> 03:13:39.760]  you know I was just listening to you earlier how you were talking about
[03:13:39.760 --> 03:13:43.760]  people don't see the evil going on
[03:13:43.760 --> 03:13:47.760]  well Bible says that we're going to be living in days
[03:13:47.760 --> 03:13:51.760]  where good is called evil and evil is called good
[03:13:51.760 --> 03:13:54.760]  and I really believe that we're in those days Alex
[03:13:54.760 --> 03:13:57.760]  and people just don't want to see what's going on
[03:13:57.760 --> 03:14:00.760]  by the way Fox News on their radio section
[03:14:00.760 --> 03:14:03.760]  posts stuff that basically comes from m4wars.com
[03:14:03.760 --> 03:14:08.760]  it should be top Fox News CNN everywhere
[03:14:08.760 --> 03:14:10.760]  that the army manuals
[03:14:10.760 --> 03:14:13.760]  clearly Southern Poverty Law Center
[03:14:13.760 --> 03:14:18.760]  I can tell the typeset the graphic is from one of their previous graphics
[03:14:18.760 --> 03:14:20.760]  I mean I see this all the time I know who it is
[03:14:20.760 --> 03:14:25.760]  saying quote all Catholics are extremists next to Al Qaeda
[03:14:25.760 --> 03:14:28.760]  and then evangelical Protestants
[03:14:28.760 --> 03:14:30.760]  I mean that but see it's not even a big deal now
[03:14:30.760 --> 03:14:32.760]  it's like the state owns your kids
[03:14:32.760 --> 03:14:34.760]  you will take shots
[03:14:34.760 --> 03:14:36.760]  the TSA will be on your highways
[03:14:36.760 --> 03:14:38.760]  we're buying billions of bullets
[03:14:38.760 --> 03:14:40.760]  and Christians are terrorists
[03:14:40.760 --> 03:14:42.760]  and it's not even a news item
[03:14:42.760 --> 03:14:48.760]  you see I mean that shows you how deep into this crazy Orwellville we've gotten
[03:14:48.760 --> 03:14:51.760]  one the sad thing about it is
[03:14:51.760 --> 03:14:57.760]  America is asleep and the church is asleep just as well
[03:14:57.760 --> 03:15:03.760]  and you know I've seen where Obama wants to try to stop Social Security now
[03:15:03.760 --> 03:15:09.760]  and you know it's really sad for especially for
[03:15:09.760 --> 03:15:12.760]  elderly who has worked all their lives for Social Security
[03:15:12.760 --> 03:15:17.760]  and now for our youth because they have nothing to work for
[03:15:17.760 --> 03:15:20.760]  the model of the healthcare the way it's written
[03:15:20.760 --> 03:15:23.760]  now they admit the death panels now have you noticed that
[03:15:23.760 --> 03:15:26.760]  of course it was written by insurance companies to make you buy a product
[03:15:26.760 --> 03:15:29.760]  and then they can adulterate the product
[03:15:29.760 --> 03:15:32.760]  it would be better to have a pure socialist system of healthcare than this
[03:15:32.760 --> 03:15:36.760]  but see socialism wasn't created by angels
[03:15:36.760 --> 03:15:38.760]  and I'm not saying socialism is good
[03:15:38.760 --> 03:15:40.760]  I'm saying better than this fascistic system that they call socialist
[03:15:40.760 --> 03:15:45.760]  it was created by eugenicists that want to control society
[03:15:45.760 --> 03:15:48.760]  and want to reduce the population
[03:15:48.760 --> 03:15:50.760]  and so you've got these fools
[03:15:50.760 --> 03:15:53.760]  I mean it makes me physically ill calling in to talk radio going because I've heard them
[03:15:53.760 --> 03:15:57.760]  oh you're just mad that Obama's giving us something free and redistributing wealth
[03:15:57.760 --> 03:16:00.760]  when he works for the big six mega banks
[03:16:00.760 --> 03:16:04.760]  absolutely sworn to destroy this culture and this society
[03:16:04.760 --> 03:16:05.760]  thank you for the call
[03:16:05.760 --> 03:16:07.760]  we're gonna go to our guest till about 40 after
[03:16:07.760 --> 03:16:08.760]  then I'll go to Mike
[03:16:08.760 --> 03:16:12.760]  then I'll go to Steve, Chris, Nelson and others that are patiently holding
[03:16:12.760 --> 03:16:14.760]  but let me show TV viewers that are watching
[03:16:14.760 --> 03:16:18.760]  this Austin, Texas government press release
[03:16:18.760 --> 03:16:21.760]  this is the office of the police chief
[03:16:21.760 --> 03:16:24.760]  you guys can just document, Kamen, I have it right here
[03:16:24.760 --> 03:16:27.760]  statement from chief Art Acevedo
[03:16:27.760 --> 03:16:34.760]  regarding Antonio Bieler grand jury indictments
[03:16:34.760 --> 03:16:37.760]  he said we appreciate the thorough investigative and review process
[03:16:37.760 --> 03:16:40.760]  where they told you to drop your case against them
[03:16:40.760 --> 03:16:44.760]  and Antonio Bieler joins us, he's a political activist in Austin, Texas
[03:16:44.760 --> 03:16:47.760]  most well known for his activism and police accountability
[03:16:47.760 --> 03:16:52.760]  which stemmed from his controversial arrest in Austin on New Year's Day 2012
[03:16:52.760 --> 03:16:56.760]  after he witnessed a woman he alleges was being abused by Austin police officers
[03:16:56.760 --> 03:17:00.760]  his activist work is funneled through the peaceful streets project
[03:17:00.760 --> 03:17:02.760]  he found it with the help of other local activists
[03:17:02.760 --> 03:17:04.760]  and that's why they're now indicting him
[03:17:04.760 --> 03:17:07.760]  he is a West Point graduate, an airport ranger, qualified former military officer
[03:17:07.760 --> 03:17:10.760]  with TERS in Kosovo and Iraq, he also works as a teacher
[03:17:10.760 --> 03:17:13.760]  homeschooling specialist, that's terrorist
[03:17:13.760 --> 03:17:16.760]  man, you're a veteran too, that's the worst part
[03:17:16.760 --> 03:17:19.760]  and college and MBA admissions consultant
[03:17:19.760 --> 03:17:22.760]  during the breaks you're out here doing that
[03:17:22.760 --> 03:17:28.760]  Antonio Bieler.com is the website, we'll put that up on screen for folks
[03:17:28.760 --> 03:17:31.760]  we're going to skip this break because we're in overdrive right now
[03:17:31.760 --> 03:17:35.760]  I gotta tell you, here is the magazine
[03:17:35.760 --> 03:17:37.760]  where our reporters, for TV viewers out there
[03:17:37.760 --> 03:17:40.760]  other folks can just go to Infowars.com and see it
[03:17:40.760 --> 03:17:43.760]  look right here, it's our reporters
[03:17:43.760 --> 03:17:46.760]  or our crew being given tickets for handing out magazines
[03:17:46.760 --> 03:17:48.760]  and the police admitted to me on the phone
[03:17:48.760 --> 03:17:50.760]  we've never been told to do this before but we're going to do it
[03:17:50.760 --> 03:17:52.760]  and until I went down there and threatened to sue them
[03:17:52.760 --> 03:17:55.760]  then they backed off and said, we're sorry
[03:17:55.760 --> 03:17:58.760]  which is even creepier, because if I was to sue them
[03:17:58.760 --> 03:18:00.760]  they'd probably just indict me for it
[03:18:00.760 --> 03:18:04.760]  which I guess you've got to be, well now we're indicting Alex for handing out magazines
[03:18:04.760 --> 03:18:08.760]  so Antonio, I mean wow, a year later
[03:18:08.760 --> 03:18:10.760]  because you have it backed down
[03:18:10.760 --> 03:18:13.760]  they are now, everybody's seen the footage from across the street
[03:18:13.760 --> 03:18:14.760]  somebody else shot that
[03:18:14.760 --> 03:18:17.760]  I mean the cop comes at you and is grabbing at you
[03:18:17.760 --> 03:18:18.760]  not wanting it to be on tape
[03:18:18.760 --> 03:18:21.760]  and now the good grand jury
[03:18:21.760 --> 03:18:26.760]  hey, same kind of folks indicted the guy in Williamson County they knew was innocent
[03:18:26.760 --> 03:18:29.760]  I mean so maybe you need to go to prison boy
[03:18:29.760 --> 03:18:31.760]  well they want me to, that's for sure
[03:18:31.760 --> 03:18:33.760]  they don't like it when people are out there exposing them for their crimes
[03:18:33.760 --> 03:18:37.760]  well I'll tell you, but we're sure a free country
[03:18:37.760 --> 03:18:40.760]  did you ever imagine when you were in Kosovo and Iraq
[03:18:40.760 --> 03:18:43.760]  in places you'd be indicted for this?
[03:18:43.760 --> 03:18:49.760]  no, and quite frankly, everyone told me how I was protecting freedoms overseas and all that stuff
[03:18:49.760 --> 03:18:52.760]  but I feel like I'm doing more to do it by fighting the police here
[03:18:52.760 --> 03:18:55.760]  because the police are the real domestic terrorists unfortunately in this country
[03:18:55.760 --> 03:18:58.760]  well they certainly are trying to turn them into that, yeah
[03:18:58.760 --> 03:19:02.760]  and I'm sure, I mean like in New York they would have just probably beat you to death
[03:19:02.760 --> 03:19:06.760]  I mean as bad as they are, it's kind of bad like when
[03:19:06.760 --> 03:19:10.760]  the Austin police are in my opinion pretty good compared to a lot of them
[03:19:10.760 --> 03:19:11.760]  but I agree with you, the EU is totally wrong
[03:19:11.760 --> 03:19:14.760]  and I guess Ace Aveda is doubling down on you
[03:19:14.760 --> 03:19:16.760]  it's actually kind of funny, I mean
[03:19:16.760 --> 03:19:21.760]  when's the last time you saw a police chief give a press release for someone who got indicted on class C misdemeanor
[03:19:21.760 --> 03:19:23.760]  it's a traffic ticket, right?
[03:19:23.760 --> 03:19:28.760]  and so they couldn't get me on the felony because there's six witnesses that say the cops lied
[03:19:28.760 --> 03:19:30.760]  there was video, there was audio, two videos actually
[03:19:30.760 --> 03:19:33.760]  so they knew that they couldn't do that but they had the same face
[03:19:33.760 --> 03:19:38.760]  so they went ahead and got me on four misdemeanors for failure to obey
[03:19:38.760 --> 03:19:43.760]  failure to obey the order of a police officer
[03:19:43.760 --> 03:19:45.760]  but the message, the way the media said was
[03:19:45.760 --> 03:19:49.760]  oh, you're allowed to film, you got to obey and not film when we say
[03:19:49.760 --> 03:19:54.760]  right, they'll come up with an order and then when you don't jump through the hoops fast enough
[03:19:54.760 --> 03:19:58.760]  when they tell you to go move back 60 feet and you only move back 50 feet
[03:19:58.760 --> 03:20:00.760]  then they can arrest you for failure to obey
[03:20:02.760 --> 03:20:04.760]  well my only issue is this
[03:20:04.760 --> 03:20:07.760]  America is being collapsed
[03:20:07.760 --> 03:20:11.760]  do the cops think the globalists that are taking over this country are going to care about their rights
[03:20:11.760 --> 03:20:13.760]  after they've taken yours?
[03:20:13.760 --> 03:20:15.760]  and that's the thing that bothers me the most about it
[03:20:15.760 --> 03:20:18.760]  is they're dispensable, they're just like soldiers
[03:20:18.760 --> 03:20:21.760]  the government doesn't care about them, they'll throw them to the side just like the soldiers
[03:20:21.760 --> 03:20:22.760]  well in fact they hate them
[03:20:22.760 --> 03:20:27.760]  there's nobody they hate more than a citizen trained to fight after they're done with you
[03:20:27.760 --> 03:20:30.760]  as long as you're on their side doing their bidding
[03:20:30.760 --> 03:20:35.760]  you're okay, but once you stand up and become an oathkeeper for example
[03:20:35.760 --> 03:20:36.760]  then you become a threat
[03:20:36.760 --> 03:20:38.760]  well they're really scared of oathkeepers
[03:20:38.760 --> 03:20:39.760]  yep, definitely
[03:20:39.760 --> 03:20:43.760]  now they're taking veterans' children if they get caught with half a marijuana cigarette
[03:20:43.760 --> 03:20:45.760]  imagine, they can also plant that on you
[03:20:45.760 --> 03:20:48.760]  I mean it should all be decriminalized right now
[03:20:48.760 --> 03:20:52.760]  the government ships in the hard drugs, they're trying to put the kids on the hard prescription drugs
[03:20:52.760 --> 03:20:54.760]  I mean what a joke, end it all now
[03:20:54.760 --> 03:21:00.760]  yeah, well I mean the drug war is used to punish the people
[03:21:00.760 --> 03:21:03.760]  and help out the prison systems, the pharmaceutical companies
[03:21:03.760 --> 03:21:05.760]  and it just feeds the system
[03:21:05.760 --> 03:21:08.760]  the more people in the system, the more people in jail, the better off they are
[03:21:08.760 --> 03:21:12.760]  well yeah, people can make excuses about this
[03:21:12.760 --> 03:21:14.760]  but we have the largest prison population in the world
[03:21:14.760 --> 03:21:17.760]  for those that don't know about your case, recap what happened
[03:21:17.760 --> 03:21:20.760]  I was a designated driver on New Year's Day 2012
[03:21:20.760 --> 03:21:22.760]  I was driving my buddy home, we were running out of gas
[03:21:22.760 --> 03:21:25.760]  pulled into 7-11 on Lamar and West 10th
[03:21:25.760 --> 03:21:27.760]  and there was a DUI stop in progress
[03:21:27.760 --> 03:21:29.760]  we watched it, we didn't want to get involved
[03:21:29.760 --> 03:21:31.760]  we were getting ready to leave
[03:21:31.760 --> 03:21:36.760]  and all of a sudden Robert Snyder and APD cops are ripping the female passenger out of the car
[03:21:36.760 --> 03:21:37.760]  throwing it to the ground
[03:21:37.760 --> 03:21:39.760]  Patrick Aborski joined in
[03:21:39.760 --> 03:21:42.760]  they were twisting our arms behind our back in a torture move
[03:21:42.760 --> 03:21:44.760]  and so I tried to take pictures
[03:21:44.760 --> 03:21:46.760]  and when she started screaming, begging me to record it
[03:21:46.760 --> 03:21:48.760]  I started yelling to the cops, telling them to stop
[03:21:48.760 --> 03:21:50.760]  Aborski then assaulted me
[03:21:50.760 --> 03:21:52.760]  started pushing me around
[03:21:52.760 --> 03:21:54.760]  and then because he assaulted me
[03:21:54.760 --> 03:21:56.760]  he had to have an excuse to assault me
[03:21:56.760 --> 03:21:58.760]  so he said I spit in his face
[03:21:58.760 --> 03:22:00.760]  which is a 30 degree felony, carries 2-10 years
[03:22:00.760 --> 03:22:04.760]  but unfortunately for him, there was multiple cameras typing it
[03:22:04.760 --> 03:22:06.760]  yeah, there was a guy across the street
[03:22:06.760 --> 03:22:08.760]  who stepped forward, who had cell phone video
[03:22:08.760 --> 03:22:10.760]  and there were other witnesses who stepped forward
[03:22:10.760 --> 03:22:16.760]  and so I'm probably one of the luckiest guys to ever get charged with a bogus felony
[03:22:16.760 --> 03:22:19.760]  because I had a bunch of witnesses who were willing to step forward
[03:22:19.760 --> 03:22:21.760]  all of them were pretty credible witnesses too
[03:22:21.760 --> 03:22:23.760]  but man, let me tell you, that is so scary
[03:22:23.760 --> 03:22:27.760]  to falsely, because I've seen this so many times in my life
[03:22:27.760 --> 03:22:30.760]  I've had it threatened with me when I knew cops were dealing drugs in Dallas
[03:22:30.760 --> 03:22:32.760]  and they said we'll plant drugs on you
[03:22:32.760 --> 03:22:35.760]  we'll say you stole stereo equipment when they knew I didn't have a criminal record
[03:22:35.760 --> 03:22:36.760]  didn't steal stuff
[03:22:36.760 --> 03:22:39.760]  and then beat me up behind closed doors
[03:22:39.760 --> 03:22:41.760]  saying next time you're dead, basically
[03:22:41.760 --> 03:22:46.760]  imagine framing people and feeling good about it
[03:22:46.760 --> 03:22:49.760]  and it would be one thing if you framed an axe murderer
[03:22:49.760 --> 03:22:50.760]  who you know had gotten out wrong with that
[03:22:50.760 --> 03:22:52.760]  I still wouldn't do that, because then you'd become the devil
[03:22:52.760 --> 03:22:53.760]  you're fighting
[03:22:53.760 --> 03:22:55.760]  but imagine just framing innocent people
[03:22:55.760 --> 03:22:58.760]  like Michael Morton, just with pleasure
[03:22:58.760 --> 03:22:59.760]  I mean they just do it
[03:22:59.760 --> 03:23:01.760]  and it seems like the better a person is
[03:23:01.760 --> 03:23:03.760]  the more fun it is to frame them
[03:23:03.760 --> 03:23:07.760]  yeah, and it's amazing because I was waiting for people to come out
[03:23:07.760 --> 03:23:10.760]  good cops on the inside to come out and say we reject this
[03:23:10.760 --> 03:23:12.760]  to go after the police chief
[03:23:12.760 --> 03:23:15.760]  but Internal Affairs, the police chief, Anthony Hippolito
[03:23:15.760 --> 03:23:19.760]  they all lined up and supported this cover-up
[03:23:19.760 --> 03:23:20.760]  it was essentially a cover-up
[03:23:20.760 --> 03:23:22.760]  and they were willing to destroy my life and Norma's life
[03:23:22.760 --> 03:23:24.760]  in order to protect this corrupt cop
[03:23:24.760 --> 03:23:26.760]  it was disgusting
[03:23:26.760 --> 03:23:31.760]  well, you know, I could sit here and show cops doing horrible things every day on this show
[03:23:31.760 --> 03:23:33.760]  if I wanted to demonize police
[03:23:33.760 --> 03:23:37.760]  but there is a culture in government of unaccountability
[03:23:37.760 --> 03:23:42.760]  I mean it's like the state police that put their hands of the two sisters in their bodies
[03:23:42.760 --> 03:23:45.760]  I mean you could see the woman foisting her hand in the vaginal area
[03:23:45.760 --> 03:23:47.760]  then into the other area
[03:23:47.760 --> 03:23:50.760]  and the state police said well that's normal, this is our new thing
[03:23:50.760 --> 03:23:51.760]  and I was like whoa
[03:23:51.760 --> 03:23:54.760]  I'm not going to go along with this
[03:23:54.760 --> 03:23:56.760]  I mean you're not doing this to my wife and children
[03:23:56.760 --> 03:23:58.760]  and then everybody freaked out about it
[03:23:58.760 --> 03:24:01.760]  so now they've indicted the police that did this
[03:24:01.760 --> 03:24:03.760]  but the head of the state police
[03:24:03.760 --> 03:24:06.760]  and before that the local commander defended it
[03:24:06.760 --> 03:24:09.760]  it shows they're really getting out of touch
[03:24:09.760 --> 03:24:14.760]  and the only reason that became an issue was because the Dodds were willing to come forward with a lawsuit
[03:24:14.760 --> 03:24:16.760]  if that didn't happen
[03:24:16.760 --> 03:24:19.760]  no, no, the state police said we do this all the time
[03:24:19.760 --> 03:24:23.760]  not only is it illegal to do a cavity search without a warrant or an emergency
[03:24:23.760 --> 03:24:25.760]  the same glove
[03:24:25.760 --> 03:24:27.760]  it was disgusting
[03:24:27.760 --> 03:24:29.760]  but not only were
[03:24:29.760 --> 03:24:30.760]  two girls, one glove
[03:24:30.760 --> 03:24:31.760]  exactly
[03:24:31.760 --> 03:24:33.760]  and both front and back
[03:24:33.760 --> 03:24:35.760]  let's show that folks
[03:24:35.760 --> 03:24:38.760]  can you show the women, state police do cavity search of women
[03:24:38.760 --> 03:24:40.760]  and the thing is Hellerson and Farrell
[03:24:40.760 --> 03:24:42.760]  those were the two cops
[03:24:42.760 --> 03:24:44.760]  they were the ones who did the deeds
[03:24:44.760 --> 03:24:46.760]  but everyone in the chain of command
[03:24:46.760 --> 03:24:49.760]  the entire department of public safety rallied behind those guys
[03:24:49.760 --> 03:24:51.760]  not one cop came out and said this is wrong
[03:24:51.760 --> 03:24:53.760]  well I mean that's what the blood draws are all about
[03:24:53.760 --> 03:24:55.760]  they know the beer is there, sit out to the liquor store
[03:24:55.760 --> 03:24:57.760]  sit outside, pull them over
[03:24:57.760 --> 03:24:59.760]  they don't do that, they want you to go drink
[03:24:59.760 --> 03:25:01.760]  and they want to put you in jail for two beers
[03:25:01.760 --> 03:25:04.760]  instead of going after people who are drunk, reckless driving
[03:25:04.760 --> 03:25:06.760]  you don't need drunk driving charges
[03:25:06.760 --> 03:25:08.760]  reckless driving is a felony
[03:25:08.760 --> 03:25:10.760]  but no, no, we're not going to have people for reckless driving
[03:25:10.760 --> 03:25:12.760]  which we had on the old code
[03:25:12.760 --> 03:25:14.760]  because reckless driving regardless
[03:25:14.760 --> 03:25:16.760]  now it's two beers you're going to go to jail
[03:25:16.760 --> 03:25:18.760]  and I sat there, I'm not even going to say the guy's name
[03:25:18.760 --> 03:25:20.760]  but a well known cop, I sat there in a restaurant
[03:25:20.760 --> 03:25:22.760]  with my children
[03:25:22.760 --> 03:25:26.760]  a few weeks ago and watched him drink tequila shots and beer
[03:25:26.760 --> 03:25:30.760]  and it just so happened I then came out of the movie theater
[03:25:30.760 --> 03:25:32.760]  after he did, it was a restaurant by it
[03:25:32.760 --> 03:25:34.760]  yeah, you can just roll the video
[03:25:34.760 --> 03:25:36.760]  yeah, there it is
[03:25:36.760 --> 03:25:38.760]  and I watched the guy go out and get in the vehicle
[03:25:38.760 --> 03:25:40.760]  now I'll be honest, I think the guy had a couple beers
[03:25:40.760 --> 03:25:42.760]  a couple tequila shots, he's a big guy
[03:25:42.760 --> 03:25:44.760]  I think he could drive fine in it for two hours
[03:25:44.760 --> 03:25:46.760]  but I'll guarantee you if they made him blow, DWI
[03:25:46.760 --> 03:25:50.760]  right, and if it was someone that didn't have the magic costume on
[03:25:50.760 --> 03:25:52.760]  they would get arrested for that
[03:25:52.760 --> 03:25:56.760]  well exactly, but my whole point is the heaviest drinkers I know are cops
[03:25:56.760 --> 03:25:58.760]  how do they sit there and pull somebody over
[03:25:58.760 --> 03:26:02.760]  and then they blow a 0.9 or whatever
[03:26:02.760 --> 03:26:04.760]  and then they go to jail, and now they take your kids
[03:26:04.760 --> 03:26:08.760]  now they, I mean it's any way to get us in the system
[03:26:08.760 --> 03:26:12.760]  I'm seeing cases every day where pot smokers are having their kids taken
[03:26:12.760 --> 03:26:14.760]  I mean that's basically revolution time right there
[03:26:14.760 --> 03:26:18.760]  when the cops want to stick their fingers in your butt
[03:26:18.760 --> 03:26:20.760]  I mean I'm sorry to use that term for listeners
[03:26:20.760 --> 03:26:22.760]  but I mean, you know, this is Twilight Zone
[03:26:22.760 --> 03:26:24.760]  I mean I worked as a large animal vet
[03:26:24.760 --> 03:26:26.760]  and when we would do exams on cows
[03:26:26.760 --> 03:26:28.760]  the vet would change his glove every time
[03:26:28.760 --> 03:26:30.760]  a cow gets better treatment than we do
[03:26:30.760 --> 03:26:32.760]  how does TSA do that?
[03:26:32.760 --> 03:26:34.760]  well they're the government
[03:26:34.760 --> 03:26:40.760]  and the problem is that people have this inability to separate the government from people
[03:26:40.760 --> 03:26:42.760]  if people can't do it, if it's a crime when a person does it
[03:26:42.760 --> 03:26:44.760]  and then all of a sudden when that person has authority from the government
[03:26:44.760 --> 03:26:46.760]  they can do it, you know, that should be a problem
[03:26:46.760 --> 03:26:48.760]  people shouldn't say just because you're a government employee
[03:26:48.760 --> 03:26:50.760]  you can commit these crimes
[03:26:50.760 --> 03:26:52.760]  but we live in a society where authority is everything
[03:26:52.760 --> 03:26:54.760]  and people think that you have to give respect to people
[03:26:54.760 --> 03:26:56.760]  and therefore those people on the other hand
[03:26:56.760 --> 03:27:00.760]  have the right to commit crimes
[03:27:00.760 --> 03:27:02.760]  that is completely backwards
[03:27:02.760 --> 03:27:04.760]  in the old days when this country was trying to follow Bill of Rights
[03:27:04.760 --> 03:27:06.760]  if you did have a uniform
[03:27:06.760 --> 03:27:08.760]  you had to be commissioned by Congress
[03:27:08.760 --> 03:27:10.760]  to even have a uniform in the military
[03:27:10.760 --> 03:27:12.760]  that's why they didn't want police to wear uniforms
[03:27:12.760 --> 03:27:14.760]  because they're like, that's the military
[03:27:14.760 --> 03:27:16.760]  but New York started it first
[03:27:16.760 --> 03:27:18.760]  you had guys in suits
[03:27:18.760 --> 03:27:20.760]  and let me tell you, they better behave themselves
[03:27:20.760 --> 03:27:22.760]  or they were in trouble
[03:27:22.760 --> 03:27:24.760]  because people knew you've got to keep that authority in check
[03:27:24.760 --> 03:27:26.760]  it's called a servant, not an official
[03:27:26.760 --> 03:27:28.760]  right, and I would love to go back to the days
[03:27:28.760 --> 03:27:30.760]  when they were public servants
[03:27:30.760 --> 03:27:32.760]  well, again, for me the biggest thing is
[03:27:32.760 --> 03:27:34.760]  I've seen the video
[03:27:34.760 --> 03:27:36.760]  is you don't spit on him
[03:27:36.760 --> 03:27:38.760]  and the fact that he'd try to put you in jail
[03:27:38.760 --> 03:27:40.760]  for what was it, maybe seven years if he'd have got you?
[03:27:40.760 --> 03:27:42.760]  two to ten years
[03:27:42.760 --> 03:27:44.760]  yeah, yeah, so the average is about seven I was reading
[03:27:44.760 --> 03:27:46.760]  so seven years in jail
[03:27:46.760 --> 03:27:48.760]  and they would sleep good
[03:27:48.760 --> 03:27:50.760]  sending you to jail
[03:27:50.760 --> 03:27:52.760]  because you didn't follow his orders
[03:27:52.760 --> 03:27:54.760]  right, to teach me respect
[03:27:54.760 --> 03:27:56.760]  and he told me when I was in the truck
[03:27:56.760 --> 03:27:58.760]  it was just me and him
[03:27:58.760 --> 03:28:00.760]  he said, you don't F with police, you F with the wrong cop
[03:28:00.760 --> 03:28:02.760]  and now you're going to F and pay
[03:28:02.760 --> 03:28:04.760]  and by that he meant you're going to go to jail
[03:28:04.760 --> 03:28:06.760]  for a crime you didn't commit
[03:28:06.760 --> 03:28:08.760]  but what really makes me mad is, yeah, this guy's a horrible, terrible person
[03:28:08.760 --> 03:28:10.760]  and he should go to jail for what he did
[03:28:10.760 --> 03:28:12.760]  but what really makes me mad is the fact that
[03:28:12.760 --> 03:28:14.760]  it's clear, there's no question
[03:28:14.760 --> 03:28:16.760]  that he lied and he committed the felony crimes
[03:28:16.760 --> 03:28:18.760]  that night, and yet
[03:28:18.760 --> 03:28:20.760]  Chief Acevedo and other members
[03:28:20.760 --> 03:28:22.760]  of the Austin Police Department continue to
[03:28:22.760 --> 03:28:24.760]  to support this notion that I was a criminal
[03:28:24.760 --> 03:28:26.760]  that night
[03:28:26.760 --> 03:28:28.760]  well here's the deal, if Acevedo doesn't say turn your guns in
[03:28:28.760 --> 03:28:30.760]  Fidel Castro loves everybody
[03:28:30.760 --> 03:28:32.760]  I mean, he says he doesn't like Fidel Castro
[03:28:32.760 --> 03:28:34.760]  but Fidel Castro says the citizens shouldn't have guns
[03:28:34.760 --> 03:28:36.760]  he says, you know, turn these guns in
[03:28:36.760 --> 03:28:38.760]  turn these mags in, you know, or
[03:28:38.760 --> 03:28:40.760]  you're for the criminals, criminals can get guns illegally
[03:28:40.760 --> 03:28:42.760]  criminals are going to get guns anyways, you're going to use
[03:28:42.760 --> 03:28:44.760]  a universal background check to take our guns
[03:28:44.760 --> 03:28:46.760]  we all know what this is about
[03:28:46.760 --> 03:28:48.760]  Art Acevedo's a smart guy, he knows
[03:28:48.760 --> 03:28:50.760]  he says he wants to come in, I know he listens
[03:28:50.760 --> 03:28:52.760]  come on, let's go
[03:28:52.760 --> 03:28:54.760]  you know, I'll be civil with you
[03:28:54.760 --> 03:28:56.760]  he's a smart talker
[03:28:56.760 --> 03:28:58.760]  but let me tell you, if he doesn't do that
[03:28:58.760 --> 03:29:00.760]  the police union will have him out
[03:29:00.760 --> 03:29:02.760]  so all it is, is that
[03:29:02.760 --> 03:29:04.760]  our local gang is not as bad as other gangs
[03:29:04.760 --> 03:29:06.760]  on average, but they are still a gang
[03:29:06.760 --> 03:29:08.760]  and look at New York
[03:29:08.760 --> 03:29:10.760]  I mean, I've talked to
[03:29:10.760 --> 03:29:12.760]  Austin cops that have asked directions
[03:29:12.760 --> 03:29:14.760]  of New York cops, and they scream at you
[03:29:14.760 --> 03:29:16.760]  I've seen them do it to terrorists
[03:29:16.760 --> 03:29:18.760]  to little kids in a family
[03:29:18.760 --> 03:29:20.760]  I mean, no respect for themselves
[03:29:20.760 --> 03:29:22.760]  no respect for anything, on just a wild
[03:29:22.760 --> 03:29:24.760]  power trip
[03:29:24.760 --> 03:29:26.760]  the cops in New York smoke cigars
[03:29:26.760 --> 03:29:28.760]  on duty, with their hats on
[03:29:28.760 --> 03:29:30.760]  sideways
[03:29:30.760 --> 03:29:32.760]  what does that tell you?
[03:29:32.760 --> 03:29:34.760]  they have no respect for themselves, for their
[03:29:34.760 --> 03:29:36.760]  uniform, or for the people
[03:29:36.760 --> 03:29:38.760]  exactly, because even if you were a corrupt person
[03:29:38.760 --> 03:29:40.760]  you'd want to treat the public with respect
[03:29:40.760 --> 03:29:42.760]  because you want your family treated with respect
[03:29:42.760 --> 03:29:44.760]  we're going to come back, talk about your case
[03:29:44.760 --> 03:29:46.760]  and your website, and take phone calls
[03:29:46.760 --> 03:30:14.760]  Antonio Bieler is our guest
[03:30:17.760 --> 03:30:19.760]  but we can't do that
[03:30:19.760 --> 03:30:20.760]  without your help
[03:30:20.760 --> 03:30:22.760]  by getting the films, bumper stickers
[03:30:22.760 --> 03:30:24.760]  and t-shirts at infowars.com
[03:30:24.760 --> 03:30:26.760]  you will wake up people in your area
[03:30:26.760 --> 03:30:28.760]  and support our operation
[03:30:28.760 --> 03:30:30.760]  as we move to the next level
[03:30:30.760 --> 03:30:32.760]  we need your help
[03:30:32.760 --> 03:30:34.760]  to spread the word like never before
[03:30:34.760 --> 03:30:36.760]  they wish to hide themselves
[03:30:36.760 --> 03:30:38.760]  during this tectonic battle
[03:30:38.760 --> 03:30:40.760]  between the forces of freedom and darkness
[03:30:40.760 --> 03:30:42.760]  you are the response
[03:30:42.760 --> 03:30:44.760]  to the globalist technocrats
[03:30:44.760 --> 03:30:46.760]  and their program of
[03:30:46.760 --> 03:30:48.760]  global eugenics dehumanization
[03:30:48.760 --> 03:30:50.760]  and ultimate extermination
[03:30:50.760 --> 03:30:52.760]  the war is here
[03:30:52.760 --> 03:30:54.760]  it's an infowar
[03:30:54.760 --> 03:30:56.760]  the spirit of 1776
[03:30:56.760 --> 03:30:58.760]  versus the mindset
[03:30:58.760 --> 03:31:00.760]  of 1984
[03:31:00.760 --> 03:31:02.760]  we've lived in this neighborhood
[03:31:02.760 --> 03:31:04.760]  for years, we have an alarm
[03:31:04.760 --> 03:31:06.760]  system, and all of our doors have
[03:31:06.760 --> 03:31:08.760]  deadbolts, they kicked in our door
[03:31:08.760 --> 03:31:10.760]  and were in and out of our house in about
[03:31:10.760 --> 03:31:12.760]  five minutes, the police arrived in about
[03:31:12.760 --> 03:31:14.760]  20 minutes, but they were long gone
[03:31:14.760 --> 03:31:16.760]  with our TV, jewelry, and my
[03:31:16.760 --> 03:31:18.760]  guns. I kept thinking, what if
[03:31:18.760 --> 03:31:20.760]  my family had been home?
[03:31:20.760 --> 03:31:22.760]  The police officer said that more than
[03:31:22.760 --> 03:31:24.760]  85% of break-ins are through a door
[03:31:24.760 --> 03:31:26.760]  and that deadbolts alone don't
[03:31:26.760 --> 03:31:28.760]  stop intruders. The officer told
[03:31:28.760 --> 03:31:30.760]  me to go to easyarmor.net
[03:31:30.760 --> 03:31:32.760]  if we wanted something that would actually
[03:31:32.760 --> 03:31:34.760]  stop an intruder. EasyArmor
[03:31:34.760 --> 03:31:36.760]  reinforces all of the weak points
[03:31:36.760 --> 03:31:38.760]  on your doors and is guaranteed to
[03:31:38.760 --> 03:31:40.760]  prevent kick-ins. I was surprised
[03:31:40.760 --> 03:31:42.760]  with how little EasyArmor costs
[03:31:42.760 --> 03:31:44.760]  and I installed EasyArmor
[03:31:44.760 --> 03:32:10.760]  in about 30 minutes.
[03:32:14.760 --> 03:32:16.760]  Free Food Waste Recycling System from Tereganics
[03:32:16.760 --> 03:32:18.760]  Finally, a way to recycle all your
[03:32:18.760 --> 03:32:20.760]  food and plant waste safely and effectively
[03:32:20.760 --> 03:32:22.760]  and stop using fertilizers.

[03:32:24.760 --> 03:32:26.760]  Rather than decomposition, the Bokashi
[03:32:26.760 --> 03:32:28.760]  system uses fermentation to break down
[03:32:28.760 --> 03:32:30.760]  waste, so it takes less time to create
[03:32:30.760 --> 03:32:32.760]  nutrient-dense humus for crops or gardens
[03:32:32.760 --> 03:32:34.760]  with no turning and no obnoxious odors.

[03:32:58.760 --> 03:33:12.760]  Life's getting better.
[03:33:12.760 --> 03:33:16.760]  Antonio Beeler is our guest.
[03:33:16.760 --> 03:33:18.760]  You know what? You're anti-police.
[03:33:18.760 --> 03:33:20.760]  Michael Morton, you know,
[03:33:20.760 --> 03:33:23.760]  they blocked testing the bloody bandana day one.
[03:33:23.760 --> 03:33:26.760]  For some reason, they wanted to put him in jail.
[03:33:26.760 --> 03:33:28.760]  It turned out they knew it, kept him in jail.
[03:33:28.760 --> 03:33:30.760]  That's a good thing.
[03:33:30.760 --> 03:33:32.760]  I mean, maybe they should human sacrifice him
[03:33:32.760 --> 03:33:34.760]  to the government. See, instead of just sacrificing
[03:33:34.760 --> 03:33:36.760]  people like other cultures did, they now
[03:33:36.760 --> 03:33:38.760]  just put you in prison to rot and then let
[03:33:38.760 --> 03:33:40.760]  the violent offenders out. What's wrong with that?
[03:33:40.760 --> 03:33:42.760]  I mean, if you care about liberty,
[03:33:42.760 --> 03:33:44.760]  obviously, that's a bad idea.
[03:33:44.760 --> 03:33:46.760]  Do you, Antonio, do you want to
[03:33:46.760 --> 03:33:48.760]  worship government right now?
[03:33:48.760 --> 03:33:50.760]  Worship R.A. Seveda,
[03:33:50.760 --> 03:33:52.760]  kneel to him, worship
[03:33:52.760 --> 03:33:54.760]  him, and maybe he'll work
[03:33:54.760 --> 03:33:56.760]  with the grand jury to drop the charges.
[03:33:56.760 --> 03:33:58.760]  Well, the first thing, R.A. Seveda is a politician
[03:33:58.760 --> 03:34:00.760]  and he doesn't care about anyone's rights.
[03:34:00.760 --> 03:34:02.760]  I don't want to worship anyone. I want people to
[03:34:02.760 --> 03:34:04.760]  be free, and I don't think that we should
[03:34:04.760 --> 03:34:06.760]  have to bow down before cops or
[03:34:06.760 --> 03:34:08.760]  politicians. That's how an extremist would talk.
[03:34:08.760 --> 03:34:10.760]  Yeah, exactly, and that's what
[03:34:10.760 --> 03:34:12.760]  we are. We are extremists. They paint us
[03:34:12.760 --> 03:34:14.760]  as extremists. The Southern Poverty Law
[03:34:14.760 --> 03:34:16.760]  Center that you were referencing before,
[03:34:16.760 --> 03:34:18.760]  anyone who even invokes the Bill of Rights
[03:34:18.760 --> 03:34:20.760]  is an extremist.
[03:34:20.760 --> 03:34:22.760]  I think they should
[03:34:22.760 --> 03:34:24.760]  exhume the body of George Washington
[03:34:24.760 --> 03:34:26.760]  and publicly, publicly
[03:34:26.760 --> 03:34:28.760]  hanging for being a patriot.
[03:34:28.760 --> 03:34:30.760]  And Thomas Jefferson, too?
[03:34:30.760 --> 03:34:32.760]  Well, they're all terrorists, exactly.
[03:34:32.760 --> 03:34:34.760]  I think you're an extremist.
[03:34:34.760 --> 03:34:36.760]  No, no, no, seriously,
[03:34:36.760 --> 03:34:38.760]  I'm being sarcastic, obviously, before the news
[03:34:38.760 --> 03:34:40.760]  picks that up. What do you
[03:34:40.760 --> 03:34:42.760]  make of all this?
[03:34:42.760 --> 03:34:44.760]  Now America's about licking government boots
[03:34:44.760 --> 03:34:46.760]  and where is your case going
[03:34:46.760 --> 03:34:48.760]  currently? Well, so
[03:34:48.760 --> 03:34:50.760]  we'll fight these stupid charges, and
[03:34:50.760 --> 03:34:52.760]  Norma was indicted as well
[03:34:52.760 --> 03:34:54.760]  on resisting arrest, even though it was an illegal
[03:34:54.760 --> 03:34:56.760]  arrest. So we'll fight these, and then we'll
[03:34:56.760 --> 03:34:58.760]  go ahead and we'll file 1983
[03:34:58.760 --> 03:35:00.760]  civil rights lawsuits against the cops.
[03:35:00.760 --> 03:35:02.760]  But I don't have any
[03:35:02.760 --> 03:35:04.760]  faith in the system working to protect
[03:35:04.760 --> 03:35:06.760]  me or other people, so we're going
[03:35:06.760 --> 03:35:08.760]  out and doing direct action. We're trying to
[03:35:08.760 --> 03:35:10.760]  expose the cops, the criminal cops,
[03:35:10.760 --> 03:35:12.760]  for what they do, videotape them, share
[03:35:12.760 --> 03:35:14.760]  the stories of abuse, and try to change
[03:35:14.760 --> 03:35:16.760]  the culture in America where people
[03:35:16.760 --> 03:35:18.760]  stop automatically worshipping authority
[03:35:18.760 --> 03:35:20.760]  and they start asking questions, and
[03:35:20.760 --> 03:35:22.760]  when they see a cop doing something illegal, they call them
[03:35:22.760 --> 03:35:24.760]  out for it. That's actually an idea.
[03:35:24.760 --> 03:35:26.760]  We could have like
[03:35:26.760 --> 03:35:28.760]  a set of scarecrows, like images
[03:35:28.760 --> 03:35:30.760]  of cops out there,
[03:35:30.760 --> 03:35:32.760]  and then it'll be mandatory
[03:35:32.760 --> 03:35:34.760]  that when you see one,
[03:35:34.760 --> 03:35:36.760]  that it's a felony if you don't
[03:35:36.760 --> 03:35:38.760]  get out and worship just the
[03:35:38.760 --> 03:35:40.760]  uniform. Or we could just put a bunch of
[03:35:40.760 --> 03:35:42.760]  scarecrows with people with cameras in their hand and
[03:35:42.760 --> 03:35:44.760]  just terrorize the cops.
[03:35:44.760 --> 03:35:46.760]  Well, my whole issue
[03:35:46.760 --> 03:35:48.760]  is, I run into a lot of Austin cops
[03:35:48.760 --> 03:35:50.760]  and they say they're pro Second Amendment, pro this and that.
[03:35:50.760 --> 03:35:52.760]  I mean, when they were giving tickets out to
[03:35:52.760 --> 03:35:54.760]  our crew, under orders, later I went down,
[03:35:54.760 --> 03:35:56.760]  they all were like shaking my hand and going, oh, we
[03:35:56.760 --> 03:35:58.760]  think it's bull as well, and we went to
[03:35:58.760 --> 03:36:00.760]  the higher-ups and said, you know, is this right?
[03:36:00.760 --> 03:36:02.760]  And then they said, no, don't do it anymore.
[03:36:02.760 --> 03:36:04.760]  My point is, why do they need to be told
[03:36:04.760 --> 03:36:06.760]  you don't have to do this?
[03:36:06.760 --> 03:36:08.760]  I mean, give people tickets for handing
[03:36:08.760 --> 03:36:10.760]  out magazines in downtown Austin.
[03:36:10.760 --> 03:36:12.760]  Yeah, no, people should stand
[03:36:12.760 --> 03:36:14.760]  up and say, no, I'm not going to do this.
[03:36:14.760 --> 03:36:16.760]  I'm not going to participate in this. I'm not going to
[03:36:16.760 --> 03:36:18.760]  go after people who aren't committing a
[03:36:18.760 --> 03:36:20.760]  crime, and I'm not going to cover up for
[03:36:20.760 --> 03:36:22.760]  criminal cops. They should stand up and say, I'm
[03:36:22.760 --> 03:36:24.760]  going to do what's right, and
[03:36:24.760 --> 03:36:26.760]  I want to be called a hero. I want
[03:36:26.760 --> 03:36:28.760]  to be called a courageous good cop.
[03:36:28.760 --> 03:36:30.760]  Well, prove it to us. Why were they, because
[03:36:30.760 --> 03:36:32.760]  I saw the video, and I'm not a
[03:36:32.760 --> 03:36:34.760]  special forces guy like you
[03:36:34.760 --> 03:36:36.760]  where they teach you how to be
[03:36:36.760 --> 03:36:38.760]  tortured so you know how to resist torture. I guess
[03:36:38.760 --> 03:36:40.760]  that's how you knew that, but I mean, it's 101
[03:36:40.760 --> 03:36:42.760]  to grab the handcuffs and lift the arms up
[03:36:42.760 --> 03:36:44.760]  high. I've had cops do that to me when I'm
[03:36:44.760 --> 03:36:46.760]  not even resisting as a way to cause
[03:36:46.760 --> 03:36:48.760]  pain, I guess, because that's how they feel powerful.
[03:36:48.760 --> 03:36:50.760]  Why were they,
[03:36:50.760 --> 03:36:52.760]  why was he doing that to the woman?
[03:36:52.760 --> 03:36:54.760]  I think he was just trying to teach her a lesson.
[03:36:54.760 --> 03:36:56.760]  He was trying to show who was boss and
[03:36:56.760 --> 03:36:58.760]  was trying to hurt her, and I think it probably
[03:36:58.760 --> 03:37:00.760]  has to do with training, either
[03:37:00.760 --> 03:37:02.760]  formal training or
[03:37:02.760 --> 03:37:04.760]  unformal training. Yeah, what is it when somebody isn't resisting where they
[03:37:04.760 --> 03:37:06.760]  all jump on your head with their knees and
[03:37:06.760 --> 03:37:08.760]  all the time break people's necks? I mean,
[03:37:08.760 --> 03:37:10.760]  and they shout stop resisting the entire
[03:37:10.760 --> 03:37:12.760]  time because it's part of their training. They know
[03:37:12.760 --> 03:37:14.760]  that there are certain procedures that
[03:37:14.760 --> 03:37:16.760]  they need to go through to cover up their
[03:37:16.760 --> 03:37:18.760]  crimes. But why don't they go join
[03:37:18.760 --> 03:37:20.760]  like a jujitsu club or a boxing club
[03:37:20.760 --> 03:37:22.760]  because I guarantee you there's real guys want to fight
[03:37:22.760 --> 03:37:24.760]  with you there, not just jump on some
[03:37:24.760 --> 03:37:26.760]  woman who's handcuffed. I just don't get it.
[03:37:26.760 --> 03:37:28.760]  Well, if you're a bully, you don't want someone to
[03:37:28.760 --> 03:37:30.760]  fight back, and if you have a badge and gun, people are
[03:37:30.760 --> 03:37:32.760]  less likely to fight back. And in Austin,
[03:37:32.760 --> 03:37:34.760]  Texas, you get paid very well to be a bully.
[03:37:34.760 --> 03:37:36.760]  Snyder, who assaulted Norma,
[03:37:36.760 --> 03:37:38.760]  he was only on the force for three years. He
[03:37:38.760 --> 03:37:40.760]  made $88,000 last year.
[03:37:40.760 --> 03:37:42.760]  Patrick Aborski, who's only been on the force for
[03:37:42.760 --> 03:37:44.760]  12, 13 years, who assaulted
[03:37:44.760 --> 03:37:46.760]  me, he made nearly $130,000
[03:37:46.760 --> 03:37:48.760]  last year. That's right. They're on the special
[03:37:48.760 --> 03:37:50.760]  Praetorian Guard DWI detail.
[03:37:50.760 --> 03:37:52.760]  Snyder's not. Well, the point
[03:37:52.760 --> 03:37:54.760]  is the more people they arrest, the more money they get. Oh,
[03:37:54.760 --> 03:37:56.760]  yeah. I mean, I heard
[03:37:56.760 --> 03:37:58.760]  that they make this, the
[03:37:58.760 --> 03:38:00.760]  county makes $6,500 per
[03:38:00.760 --> 03:38:02.760]  DUI arrest in this county.
[03:38:02.760 --> 03:38:04.760]  Patrick Aborski had over 300
[03:38:04.760 --> 03:38:06.760]  arrests last year alone.
[03:38:06.760 --> 03:38:08.760]  Well, you know what's a real bounty? They can make up to
[03:38:08.760 --> 03:38:10.760]  $500,000 on a kid,
[03:38:10.760 --> 03:38:12.760]  and that's why they're now taking people's kids
[03:38:12.760 --> 03:38:14.760]  if they find marijuana on them. They're calling it
[03:38:14.760 --> 03:38:16.760]  a narcotic. Yeah, they've been taking kids
[03:38:16.760 --> 03:38:18.760]  for a long time. Perry did
[03:38:18.760 --> 03:38:20.760]  with those Mormon
[03:38:20.760 --> 03:38:22.760]  kids or whatever in North Texas.
[03:38:22.760 --> 03:38:24.760]  And then it came
[03:38:24.760 --> 03:38:26.760]  out, they weren't, last time I checked, doing anything
[03:38:26.760 --> 03:38:28.760]  went to them. And again, they
[03:38:28.760 --> 03:38:30.760]  always choose some group that people think is a little
[03:38:30.760 --> 03:38:32.760]  weird, but then, oh, we burned
[03:38:32.760 --> 03:38:34.760]  down the Davidians because he might have been doing something
[03:38:34.760 --> 03:38:36.760]  with young women. I mean, oh, good,
[03:38:36.760 --> 03:38:38.760]  let's kill them. That'll fix it. Right, exactly.
[03:38:38.760 --> 03:38:40.760]  Same with the
[03:38:40.760 --> 03:38:42.760]  Ruby Ridge, you know, oh, white supremacists.
[03:38:42.760 --> 03:38:44.760]  So, therefore, we're justified in killing them.
[03:38:44.760 --> 03:38:46.760]  It turned out he
[03:38:46.760 --> 03:38:48.760]  wasn't. They kept coming to him saying, I'll give
[03:38:48.760 --> 03:38:50.760]  you all this money. You just saw off this shotgun.
[03:38:50.760 --> 03:38:52.760]  And they told him, you're a former Special Forces
[03:38:52.760 --> 03:38:54.760]  Green Beret. In fact, I want to get
[03:38:54.760 --> 03:38:56.760]  him back on the show, Randy Weaver.
[03:38:56.760 --> 03:38:58.760]  We want you to infiltrate the white supremacists.
[03:38:58.760 --> 03:39:00.760]  And he said, no, I'm not going to do that.
[03:39:00.760 --> 03:39:02.760]  And so they set him up and then
[03:39:02.760 --> 03:39:04.760]  shot his wife holding the baby and
[03:39:04.760 --> 03:39:06.760]  shot the little kid in the back. Yeah, disgusting.
[03:39:06.760 --> 03:39:08.760]  And Lon Horiuchi was very proud of himself. I mean,
[03:39:08.760 --> 03:39:10.760]  listen, I'm not that tough of a guy,
[03:39:10.760 --> 03:39:12.760]  but I've done a lot of fights growing up in Dallas. For whatever
[03:39:12.760 --> 03:39:14.760]  reason, it was rough compared to this town, which I love the
[03:39:14.760 --> 03:39:16.760]  fact that people aren't getting in fights over nothing.
[03:39:16.760 --> 03:39:18.760]  But my whole deal is if, like, some big
[03:39:18.760 --> 03:39:20.760]  guys acting tough
[03:39:20.760 --> 03:39:22.760]  and, you know, doing stuff, I like
[03:39:22.760 --> 03:39:24.760]  start thinking about what I'm going to do to them,
[03:39:24.760 --> 03:39:26.760]  how much I want to fight them because they're bigger than
[03:39:26.760 --> 03:39:28.760]  I am. It's just an instinct, I guess,
[03:39:28.760 --> 03:39:30.760]  Napoleon complex, you could call it. But
[03:39:30.760 --> 03:39:32.760]  you know, I mean, it's like I'll show you
[03:39:32.760 --> 03:39:34.760]  you know, like Yoda
[03:39:34.760 --> 03:39:36.760]  to Count Dooku or something.
[03:39:36.760 --> 03:39:38.760]  And but I couldn't. But then it's
[03:39:38.760 --> 03:39:40.760]  embarrassing if someone's weaker than me
[03:39:40.760 --> 03:39:42.760]  to even imagine doing something to them.
[03:39:42.760 --> 03:39:44.760]  And then I see with thugs
[03:39:44.760 --> 03:39:46.760]  throughout history, they get more excited the
[03:39:46.760 --> 03:39:48.760]  weaker you are. I mean, you know, these
[03:39:48.760 --> 03:39:50.760]  guys were so manly, you know,
[03:39:50.760 --> 03:39:52.760]  they want to, you know, like go get in a bar fight with, you know,
[03:39:52.760 --> 03:39:54.760]  like the real deal. And
[03:39:54.760 --> 03:39:56.760]  we've seen it before. We've seen the cops
[03:39:56.760 --> 03:39:58.760]  become extra aggressive
[03:39:58.760 --> 03:40:00.760]  towards the smaller women that they deal
[03:40:00.760 --> 03:40:02.760]  with. And Patrick Hraborski has a history
[03:40:02.760 --> 03:40:04.760]  of abusing women. And we're going to
[03:40:04.760 --> 03:40:06.760]  expose that as well. What's your proof?
[03:40:06.760 --> 03:40:08.760]  Well, we have people who've
[03:40:08.760 --> 03:40:10.760]  been afraid to come forward because they're afraid
[03:40:10.760 --> 03:40:12.760]  of the Austin Police Department. But we have
[03:40:12.760 --> 03:40:14.760]  contacts both through direct contacts
[03:40:14.760 --> 03:40:16.760]  and through defense attorneys who know that
[03:40:16.760 --> 03:40:18.760]  this guy has been abusing people for years.
[03:40:18.760 --> 03:40:20.760]  Every defense attorney in town knows who he
[03:40:20.760 --> 03:40:22.760]  is. And we're going to expose that.
[03:40:22.760 --> 03:40:24.760]  And so now they've indicted you.
[03:40:24.760 --> 03:40:26.760]  Yeah, they've indicted me. Fortunately, it's not
[03:40:26.760 --> 03:40:28.760]  for the felony. They just threw a bunch of misdemeanors
[03:40:28.760 --> 03:40:30.760]  at me. Same with Norma. Same with
[03:40:30.760 --> 03:40:32.760]  another woman who was arrested
[03:40:32.760 --> 03:40:34.760]  for filming cops.
[03:40:34.760 --> 03:40:36.760]  You know, I knew a guy who was a
[03:40:36.760 --> 03:40:38.760]  Home Depot manager. He's been on the
[03:40:38.760 --> 03:40:40.760]  show before, but
[03:40:40.760 --> 03:40:42.760]  he got pulled over
[03:40:42.760 --> 03:40:44.760]  and they said that he'd
[03:40:44.760 --> 03:40:46.760]  thrown a cigarette out the window, which
[03:40:46.760 --> 03:40:48.760]  if I remember, he hadn't even done.
[03:40:48.760 --> 03:40:50.760]  And some famous cop, he's like a captain now,
[03:40:50.760 --> 03:40:52.760]  and there's squad car video
[03:40:52.760 --> 03:40:54.760]  of this. And the guy's, you know, he's paralyzed
[03:40:54.760 --> 03:40:56.760]  chest down. He has hand controls.
[03:40:56.760 --> 03:40:58.760]  And the cop goes, what are these? He goes, those are my hand
[03:40:58.760 --> 03:41:00.760]  controls. He goes, get out. He goes, my wife's
[03:41:00.760 --> 03:41:02.760]  got to get out and get my wheelchair. But yeah, he goes,
[03:41:02.760 --> 03:41:04.760]  no, I said get out now. And he
[03:41:04.760 --> 03:41:06.760]  couldn't. So he beats him up because he
[03:41:06.760 --> 03:41:08.760]  won't walk. And then I see these TSA
[03:41:08.760 --> 03:41:10.760]  videos where they say like the 90-year-old woman
[03:41:10.760 --> 03:41:12.760]  get up and she's like, I'm dying
[03:41:12.760 --> 03:41:14.760]  of cancer. And then they drag him out and all this.
[03:41:14.760 --> 03:41:16.760]  It's like crazy people. I
[03:41:16.760 --> 03:41:18.760]  mean, I don't get
[03:41:18.760 --> 03:41:20.760]  I just don't get it. Have you seen the video of them
[03:41:20.760 --> 03:41:22.760]  breaking pro-lifers arms?
[03:41:22.760 --> 03:41:24.760]  I haven't seen that, but I've seen hundreds of videos
[03:41:24.760 --> 03:41:26.760]  of cops committing violent crimes over the
[03:41:26.760 --> 03:41:28.760]  past year because once you get victimized,
[03:41:28.760 --> 03:41:30.760]  you just get consumed by it.
[03:41:30.760 --> 03:41:32.760]  Have you seen all the videos where people are in
[03:41:32.760 --> 03:41:34.760]  wheelchairs and they say get up? Yeah,
[03:41:34.760 --> 03:41:36.760]  there's a really sad video of
[03:41:36.760 --> 03:41:38.760]  a woman who just dumps the guy out on
[03:41:38.760 --> 03:41:40.760]  his face. He's sitting in a jail
[03:41:40.760 --> 03:41:42.760]  in a wheelchair. Well, some of those cases
[03:41:42.760 --> 03:41:44.760]  we followed where they really are quadriplegics,
[03:41:44.760 --> 03:41:46.760]  the bones are like sponge and it breaks
[03:41:46.760 --> 03:41:48.760]  their bones. Yeah, it can't be good for them.
[03:41:48.760 --> 03:41:50.760]  And then they laugh at him as the person's there
[03:41:50.760 --> 03:41:52.760]  defecating and urinating all
[03:41:52.760 --> 03:41:54.760]  over themselves. It's like, oh, you threw
[03:41:54.760 --> 03:41:56.760]  a quadriplegic on the ground? This is the
[03:41:56.760 --> 03:41:58.760]  new I mean, those people should be
[03:41:58.760 --> 03:42:00.760]  run out of the police force. But no, they're not
[03:42:00.760 --> 03:42:02.760]  right. And what all I'm asking is
[03:42:02.760 --> 03:42:04.760]  for the so-called good, courageous
[03:42:04.760 --> 03:42:06.760]  cops to step up and stand
[03:42:06.760 --> 03:42:08.760]  up to these bullies, start protecting the people
[03:42:08.760 --> 03:42:10.760]  from these bullies. No one has stood
[03:42:10.760 --> 03:42:12.760]  up to Patrick Borsky. I want someone to stand up to
[03:42:12.760 --> 03:42:14.760]  him or Robert Snyder or
[03:42:14.760 --> 03:42:16.760]  Martinez, who we saw. I saw a woman
[03:42:16.760 --> 03:42:18.760]  at South by Southwest because she
[03:42:18.760 --> 03:42:20.760]  tried to stand up for her own dignity. What
[03:42:20.760 --> 03:42:22.760]  happened? They were just clearing the
[03:42:22.760 --> 03:42:24.760]  streets at the end of the night and he's like, get
[03:42:24.760 --> 03:42:26.760]  off the road. And she goes, I am getting off the road.
[03:42:26.760 --> 03:42:28.760]  And then he pushes her and then she
[03:42:28.760 --> 03:42:30.760]  stands up and she's like, what are you doing? And then he
[03:42:30.760 --> 03:42:32.760]  wrestled her down. Two more cops
[03:42:32.760 --> 03:42:34.760]  joined in on the assault. And then
[03:42:34.760 --> 03:42:36.760]  you can hear other cops out there saying, stop
[03:42:36.760 --> 03:42:38.760]  resisting, stop resisting. It was completely
[03:42:38.760 --> 03:42:40.760]  absurd. I'll tell you what's creepy is I've
[03:42:40.760 --> 03:42:42.760]  been downtown
[03:42:42.760 --> 03:42:44.760]  to go see a movie at the Alamo Drafthouse
[03:42:44.760 --> 03:42:46.760]  downtown. Sometimes they only show films there and
[03:42:46.760 --> 03:42:48.760]  I won't go on 6th Street. They got some nice
[03:42:48.760 --> 03:42:50.760]  restaurants down on 4th and stuff. And I've
[03:42:50.760 --> 03:42:52.760]  seen cops with shaved heads, Satan
[03:42:52.760 --> 03:42:54.760]  tattoos on them, black gloves.
[03:42:54.760 --> 03:42:56.760]  They're like, get off the street.
[03:42:56.760 --> 03:42:58.760]  And then one time, he goes, hi Jones,
[03:42:58.760 --> 03:43:00.760]  how you doing? I was like, whoa, that's
[03:43:00.760 --> 03:43:02.760]  a criminal. I mean, my
[03:43:02.760 --> 03:43:04.760]  immediate instinct was prepare for combat.
[03:43:04.760 --> 03:43:06.760]  That's a bad guy right there.
[03:43:06.760 --> 03:43:08.760]  And what's
[03:43:08.760 --> 03:43:10.760]  scary is back when I was in college, that was like
[03:43:10.760 --> 03:43:12.760]  the thug bouncers. Most bouncers
[03:43:12.760 --> 03:43:14.760]  aren't bad guys. He's running to guys that were
[03:43:14.760 --> 03:43:16.760]  on it for a power trip where you walk in with a
[03:43:16.760 --> 03:43:18.760]  really good looking woman into a bar and they go,
[03:43:18.760 --> 03:43:20.760]  what you doing, pretty boy?
[03:43:20.760 --> 03:43:22.760]  And that's why I quit going down
[03:43:22.760 --> 03:43:24.760]  to 6th Street. I'm not a pretty boy now.
[03:43:24.760 --> 03:43:26.760]  But the point is, is that
[03:43:26.760 --> 03:43:28.760]  my God, we're just turning, I mean, we
[03:43:28.760 --> 03:43:30.760]  know North Korea, Mexico, all these
[03:43:30.760 --> 03:43:32.760]  other countries, you turn loose, you worship
[03:43:32.760 --> 03:43:34.760]  government. Thugs get in, you
[03:43:34.760 --> 03:43:36.760]  never get out of it. Generations of
[03:43:36.760 --> 03:43:38.760]  slavery. I mean, we're going into this.
[03:43:38.760 --> 03:43:40.760]  And it's really crazy. Have you seen the shaved
[03:43:40.760 --> 03:43:42.760]  head? And I'm not saying everybody with shaved heads is bad. I was
[03:43:42.760 --> 03:43:44.760]  down there talking about shaved head
[03:43:44.760 --> 03:43:46.760]  goons that South by Southwest reportedly sent out
[03:43:46.760 --> 03:43:48.760]  when the cops wouldn't do the wrong thing anymore.
[03:43:48.760 --> 03:43:50.760]  And then the code enforcers
[03:43:50.760 --> 03:43:52.760]  wouldn't do the wrong thing. They then sent goons out.
[03:43:52.760 --> 03:43:54.760]  You know, the point is, it's the
[03:43:54.760 --> 03:43:56.760]  muscle type guy. Some guy had a shaved head. He goes,
[03:43:56.760 --> 03:43:58.760]  hey, what's wrong with the shaved head?
[03:43:58.760 --> 03:44:00.760]  My hair's all falling out soon. Mine will probably be shaved.
[03:44:00.760 --> 03:44:02.760]  My point is, is that what is
[03:44:02.760 --> 03:44:04.760]  this, I mean, if these guys
[03:44:04.760 --> 03:44:06.760]  don't have their butts kicked properly,
[03:44:06.760 --> 03:44:08.760]  I mean, I just don't understand
[03:44:08.760 --> 03:44:10.760]  why they're wanting to dominate people.
[03:44:10.760 --> 03:44:12.760]  Well, it's human nature.
[03:44:12.760 --> 03:44:14.760]  Not my nature. No, not
[03:44:14.760 --> 03:44:16.760]  yours. And there are people, if you have morals,
[03:44:16.760 --> 03:44:18.760]  ethical, you know, groundings,
[03:44:18.760 --> 03:44:20.760]  you don't want to hurt people. Well, it's not even that.
[03:44:20.760 --> 03:44:22.760]  It's shameful to want
[03:44:22.760 --> 03:44:24.760]  to dominate people that are under your control.
[03:44:24.760 --> 03:44:26.760]  Right, but the Stanford Prison
[03:44:26.760 --> 03:44:28.760]  experiment was one that showed us that when you
[03:44:28.760 --> 03:44:30.760]  give people power, authority, and control,
[03:44:30.760 --> 03:44:32.760]  that a huge segment of the population
[03:44:32.760 --> 03:44:34.760]  will go ahead and abuse that. 92%.
[03:44:34.760 --> 03:44:36.760]  Yeah, I
[03:44:36.760 --> 03:44:38.760]  didn't know the number. They began to desire
[03:44:38.760 --> 03:44:40.760]  to kill people for no reason. Yeah, and
[03:44:40.760 --> 03:44:42.760]  you have examples through
[03:44:42.760 --> 03:44:44.760]  military and whatnot throughout the ages
[03:44:44.760 --> 03:44:46.760]  where torture becomes a
[03:44:46.760 --> 03:44:48.760]  pastime for these people.
[03:44:48.760 --> 03:44:50.760]  Well, I mean, it's what happens when weak
[03:44:50.760 --> 03:44:52.760]  people take on the mantle of being men.
[03:44:54.760 --> 03:44:56.760]  You know what you ought to do with the Office of the
[03:44:56.760 --> 03:44:58.760]  Police Department? You ought to, like, say, hey, let's have a
[03:44:58.760 --> 03:45:00.760]  charity boxing match.
[03:45:00.760 --> 03:45:02.760]  I guarantee you it'd make a million dollars. Let's say,
[03:45:02.760 --> 03:45:04.760]  give it to Children's Charity or something.
[03:45:04.760 --> 03:45:06.760]  The CPS charity one maybe helps disabled
[03:45:06.760 --> 03:45:08.760]  kids. I bet they
[03:45:08.760 --> 03:45:10.760]  check it out when they have a boxing match. Would you have a boxing
[03:45:10.760 --> 03:45:12.760]  match with one of those guys? Well, some of those
[03:45:12.760 --> 03:45:14.760]  guys are pretty pumped up on steroids.
[03:45:14.760 --> 03:45:16.760]  Come on, I'll do it. I'll do it.
[03:45:16.760 --> 03:45:18.760]  I'll do it. It would depend. I boxed
[03:45:18.760 --> 03:45:20.760]  in college and the difference of 20 pounds
[03:45:20.760 --> 03:45:22.760]  is huge, so, yeah.
[03:45:22.760 --> 03:45:24.760]  I'm not afraid. Well, yeah, I mean.
[03:45:24.760 --> 03:45:26.760]  When they're in the wrong, you can't stomp somebody
[03:45:26.760 --> 03:45:28.760]  in the wrong? Well, I'd rather stomp them
[03:45:28.760 --> 03:45:30.760]  through direct action, through, you know,
[03:45:30.760 --> 03:45:32.760]  exposing them. Come on, challenge them to a
[03:45:32.760 --> 03:45:34.760]  boxing match.
[03:45:34.760 --> 03:45:36.760]  There's a guy in downtown named Vess who's,
[03:45:36.760 --> 03:45:38.760]  you know, roided out. He's huge and we
[03:45:38.760 --> 03:45:40.760]  saw him assaulting the victim of
[03:45:40.760 --> 03:45:42.760]  an altercation on two different
[03:45:42.760 --> 03:45:44.760]  occasions. That's a guy I don't want to step in the ring with.
[03:45:46.760 --> 03:45:48.760]  I don't think that's scary.
[03:45:48.760 --> 03:45:50.760]  I couldn't even wake up till the guy's twice bigger than I am.
[03:45:50.760 --> 03:45:52.760]  How many fights you been in? You've been in the military
[03:45:52.760 --> 03:45:54.760]  over there in Iraq. Yeah, well,
[03:45:54.760 --> 03:45:56.760]  unfortunately, I haven't been in
[03:45:56.760 --> 03:45:58.760]  any fights in a long time.
[03:45:58.760 --> 03:46:00.760]  I don't believe in fighting. You know, the fun,
[03:46:00.760 --> 03:46:02.760]  I'm going to get into it. I'm just joking around.
[03:46:02.760 --> 03:46:04.760]  Anyways, I just
[03:46:04.760 --> 03:46:06.760]  don't get it. I just don't get men
[03:46:06.760 --> 03:46:08.760]  wanting to fight somebody that's weaker than
[03:46:08.760 --> 03:46:10.760]  them. I just don't get it. Or worse,
[03:46:10.760 --> 03:46:12.760]  men who abuse women, right?
[03:46:12.760 --> 03:46:14.760]  Like they did to Norma on New Year's Day.
[03:46:14.760 --> 03:46:16.760]  They weren't even looking for a fight. They were just looking
[03:46:16.760 --> 03:46:18.760]  to throw her around because, one, they knew that she
[03:46:18.760 --> 03:46:20.760]  couldn't fight back even if she wanted to because she was so much smaller.
[03:46:20.760 --> 03:46:22.760]  And, two, they had these badges and guns
[03:46:22.760 --> 03:46:24.760]  on, which meant that if she fought back,
[03:46:24.760 --> 03:46:26.760]  you know, it would have been a death wish.
[03:46:26.760 --> 03:46:28.760]  And so they abused her because they could and
[03:46:28.760 --> 03:46:30.760]  they enjoyed it.
[03:46:30.760 --> 03:46:32.760]  It's just so alien to me.
[03:46:32.760 --> 03:46:34.760]  I mean, I just can't get it. I just don't
[03:46:34.760 --> 03:46:36.760]  understand it.
[03:46:36.760 --> 03:46:38.760]  Have you noticed that they, it seems
[03:46:38.760 --> 03:46:40.760]  like they promote those people.
[03:46:40.760 --> 03:46:42.760]  Yeah, and I don't want to use
[03:46:42.760 --> 03:46:44.760]  his name because, you know, people take it the wrong way
[03:46:44.760 --> 03:46:46.760]  but in the Dorner Manifesto, which I think
[03:46:46.760 --> 03:46:48.760]  was tampered with, but regardless, he made
[03:46:48.760 --> 03:46:50.760]  the point very clear that the
[03:46:50.760 --> 03:46:52.760]  people involved in the Rodney King beating
[03:46:52.760 --> 03:46:54.760]  are now the superintendents.
[03:46:54.760 --> 03:46:56.760]  They're up at the very top of the team. Yeah, but it
[03:46:56.760 --> 03:46:58.760]  shows how twisted he was from
[03:46:58.760 --> 03:47:00.760]  that culture that he'd go shoot somebody's
[03:47:00.760 --> 03:47:02.760]  you know,
[03:47:02.760 --> 03:47:04.760]  girlfriend to get at him or somebody's
[03:47:04.760 --> 03:47:06.760]  daughter. Oh, yeah. And it just whacked
[03:47:06.760 --> 03:47:08.760]  out. Yeah, I mean, I definitely. And then the cops
[03:47:08.760 --> 03:47:10.760]  burned him up and said
[03:47:10.760 --> 03:47:12.760]  they didn't and burned him up
[03:47:12.760 --> 03:47:14.760]  in front of us and said they'd burn him up. Yeah.
[03:47:14.760 --> 03:47:16.760]  Oh, man, it's bad. I think
[03:47:16.760 --> 03:47:18.760]  the police being out of control is a
[03:47:18.760 --> 03:47:20.760]  manifestation of the culture being out of control.
[03:47:20.760 --> 03:47:22.760]  Yeah, and I think it's really important that
[03:47:22.760 --> 03:47:24.760]  people who are raising children go out
[03:47:24.760 --> 03:47:26.760]  of their way to tell their kids not to
[03:47:26.760 --> 03:47:28.760]  respect authority just because
[03:47:28.760 --> 03:47:30.760]  it's authority. Get them to question
[03:47:30.760 --> 03:47:32.760]  everything. Get them to challenge, well, why
[03:47:32.760 --> 03:47:34.760]  is this person above me? Why does this person
[03:47:34.760 --> 03:47:36.760]  have authority over me? And get them to believe that
[03:47:36.760 --> 03:47:38.760]  they're sovereign, free individuals. And then
[03:47:38.760 --> 03:47:40.760]  when the cops are rounding people up,
[03:47:40.760 --> 03:47:42.760]  putting them in boxcars like they did in Germany,
[03:47:42.760 --> 03:47:44.760]  then people can stand up and say, no. Well, why are you
[03:47:44.760 --> 03:47:46.760]  being anti-police? They were doing their job in Germany.
[03:47:46.760 --> 03:47:48.760]  Yeah, well, that's the problem.
[03:47:48.760 --> 03:47:50.760]  Doing your job is not sufficient. If you're
[03:47:50.760 --> 03:47:52.760]  doing an unethical, immoral job,
[03:47:52.760 --> 03:47:54.760]  you should either quit or resist.
[03:47:54.760 --> 03:47:56.760]  I think you're going a little too far about
[03:47:56.760 --> 03:47:58.760]  Germany and Russia and China.
[03:47:58.760 --> 03:48:00.760]  I think it's a good idea. We turn all our guns in,
[03:48:00.760 --> 03:48:02.760]  worship the government, then they'll treat us
[03:48:02.760 --> 03:48:04.760]  nice. Actually, they won't. People say, well, I
[03:48:04.760 --> 03:48:06.760]  just grovel. They'll be nice to me.
[03:48:06.760 --> 03:48:08.760]  No, no, no. Bad guys will then get in
[03:48:08.760 --> 03:48:10.760]  that like to torture people.
[03:48:10.760 --> 03:48:12.760]  Yeah, I mean, when you give them an inch,
[03:48:12.760 --> 03:48:14.760]  they take a mile. Well, I don't know about all the specifics
[03:48:14.760 --> 03:48:16.760]  and all the cases and all the cops you're talking
[03:48:16.760 --> 03:48:18.760]  about. And again, I'll just be honest.
[03:48:18.760 --> 03:48:20.760]  And I'm not saying this because I live here because
[03:48:20.760 --> 03:48:22.760]  I don't even live in Austin anymore. I live outside
[03:48:22.760 --> 03:48:24.760]  Austin. I've been all over the country. I know you have
[03:48:24.760 --> 03:48:26.760]  too. I mean, let me tell you, the cops are a lot worse
[03:48:26.760 --> 03:48:28.760]  in other areas. Yeah, I mean, it is
[03:48:28.760 --> 03:48:30.760]  creepville, man. Have you been around New York?
[03:48:30.760 --> 03:48:32.760]  I lived in New York, you know,
[03:48:32.760 --> 03:48:34.760]  and it's degrees of bad.
[03:48:34.760 --> 03:48:36.760]  And what I'm looking for is I'm just
[03:48:36.760 --> 03:48:38.760]  looking for the good cops. No, I know, but have you seen it
[03:48:38.760 --> 03:48:40.760]  where like pot-bellied cops have sideways hats on
[03:48:40.760 --> 03:48:42.760]  smoking cigarettes? Well, I've seen the cops
[03:48:42.760 --> 03:48:44.760]  in New York do some pretty crazy stuff.
[03:48:44.760 --> 03:48:46.760]  So, but it's degrees
[03:48:46.760 --> 03:48:48.760]  of bad. And all I want are the good cops
[03:48:48.760 --> 03:48:50.760]  to stand up and start outing the bad cops, start
[03:48:50.760 --> 03:48:52.760]  arresting the bad cops. But I mean, if we let the cops, and then
[03:48:52.760 --> 03:48:54.760]  Art Acevedo will like fire a woman
[03:48:54.760 --> 03:48:56.760]  cop because she punched somebody
[03:48:56.760 --> 03:48:58.760]  who was, I think, on
[03:48:58.760 --> 03:49:00.760]  tape spitting in their face.
[03:49:00.760 --> 03:49:02.760]  So then,
[03:49:02.760 --> 03:49:04.760]  that's a crime of passion. I think they said
[03:49:04.760 --> 03:49:06.760]  she lied about it, but then
[03:49:06.760 --> 03:49:08.760]  it's all about burning a few cops
[03:49:08.760 --> 03:49:10.760]  to act like you're doing your job. Oh, exactly.
[03:49:10.760 --> 03:49:12.760]  And so Art Acevedo will tell you, if
[03:49:12.760 --> 03:49:14.760]  you ask him about it, he'll say, no, I've
[03:49:14.760 --> 03:49:16.760]  fired cops before.
[03:49:16.760 --> 03:49:18.760]  But he fires them because they fail
[03:49:18.760 --> 03:49:20.760]  to tell the truth about how
[03:49:20.760 --> 03:49:22.760]  they committed a crime so that they can cover
[03:49:22.760 --> 03:49:24.760]  up for it. The problem with that female
[03:49:24.760 --> 03:49:26.760]  officer was she wasn't honest with her chain
[03:49:26.760 --> 03:49:28.760]  of command about what she did, so they
[03:49:28.760 --> 03:49:30.760]  weren't able to cover up for it. Patrick
[03:49:30.760 --> 03:49:32.760]  Oborski, he did it the right way.
[03:49:32.760 --> 03:49:34.760]  He stuck to his lie, and he told the
[03:49:34.760 --> 03:49:36.760]  chain of command exactly what happened, and then they rallied
[03:49:36.760 --> 03:49:38.760]  behind him. Have you
[03:49:38.760 --> 03:49:40.760]  run into him yet? I have. I've run
[03:49:40.760 --> 03:49:42.760]  into him a couple of times. The first time was
[03:49:42.760 --> 03:49:44.760]  pretty passionate. I called him a coward.
[03:49:44.760 --> 03:49:46.760]  And then the other times,
[03:49:46.760 --> 03:49:48.760]  he hides his face from
[03:49:48.760 --> 03:49:50.760]  me. He runs away, like all cowards
[03:49:50.760 --> 03:49:52.760]  do.
[03:49:52.760 --> 03:49:54.760]  I think we should handle this by a boxing
[03:49:54.760 --> 03:49:56.760]  match. Have you seen the movie
[03:49:56.760 --> 03:49:58.760]  El Cib with Charlton Heston? You know, it's actually a true story.
[03:49:58.760 --> 03:50:00.760]  No. In the old days, they just put two
[03:50:00.760 --> 03:50:02.760]  guys in our ring with swords.
[03:50:02.760 --> 03:50:04.760]  People were pretty nice back then, though,
[03:50:04.760 --> 03:50:06.760]  because you didn't want to mess with somebody unless you could really back it up.
[03:50:06.760 --> 03:50:08.760]  Well, exactly, and that's the thing. They hide
[03:50:08.760 --> 03:50:10.760]  behind their badges. Patrick Oborski
[03:50:10.760 --> 03:50:12.760]  would never stand up to even
[03:50:12.760 --> 03:50:14.760]  the women that he abuses without his
[03:50:14.760 --> 03:50:16.760]  badge and his gun. Now, come on.
[03:50:16.760 --> 03:50:18.760]  It's not abuse to, like, tackle
[03:50:18.760 --> 03:50:20.760]  a woman. That's friendly.
[03:50:20.760 --> 03:50:22.760]  They twisted her arms.
[03:50:22.760 --> 03:50:24.760]  The torture movie is called Strapido,
[03:50:24.760 --> 03:50:26.760]  so that was definitely torture,
[03:50:26.760 --> 03:50:28.760]  but we have other stories where he
[03:50:28.760 --> 03:50:30.760]  chokes women, where he presses upon them
[03:50:30.760 --> 03:50:32.760]  when he's buckling them in, where he
[03:50:32.760 --> 03:50:34.760]  ripped a woman out of the car so hard
[03:50:34.760 --> 03:50:36.760]  he ripped the woman's sleeve off of the
[03:50:36.760 --> 03:50:38.760]  jacket. And these are not
[03:50:38.760 --> 03:50:40.760]  one-off instances. These are just the stories
[03:50:40.760 --> 03:50:42.760]  we know about with Patrick Oborski.
[03:51:10.760 --> 03:51:12.760]  Tarp, the national debt was at
[03:51:12.760 --> 03:51:14.760]  11 trillion gold, trading around
[03:51:14.760 --> 03:51:16.760]  $850 per ounce. Close to
[03:51:16.760 --> 03:51:18.760]  2012, the national debt exceeded
[03:51:18.760 --> 03:51:20.760]  16.4 trillion. Gold doubled
[03:51:20.760 --> 03:51:22.760]  to $1600 per ounce.
[03:51:22.760 --> 03:51:24.760]  The 20 trillion threshold for the national
[03:51:24.760 --> 03:51:26.760]  debt is inevitable. Politicians
[03:51:26.760 --> 03:51:28.760]  in Washington have a ferocious appetite
[03:51:28.760 --> 03:51:30.760]  for spending and stimulus. What's worse,
[03:51:30.760 --> 03:51:32.760]  a printing press to finance.
[03:51:32.760 --> 03:51:34.760]  A hundred years ago, we had a gold standard
[03:51:34.760 --> 03:51:36.760]  to limit this madness, but now you have
[03:51:36.760 --> 03:51:38.760]  to adopt your own gold standard.
[03:51:38.760 --> 03:51:40.760]  Don't be fooled with paper promises.

[03:52:00.760 --> 03:52:02.760]  In the last two years alone,
[03:52:02.760 --> 03:52:04.760]  the U.S. has seen huge losses to our food
[03:52:04.760 --> 03:52:06.760]  supply. In 2011, storms
[03:52:06.760 --> 03:52:08.760]  and floods raged across the U.S.
[03:52:08.760 --> 03:52:10.760]  costing us $20 billion in lost crops alone.
[03:52:10.760 --> 03:52:12.760]  In 2012, we saw the largest drought
[03:52:12.760 --> 03:52:14.760]  in the country in more than 50 years.
[03:52:14.760 --> 03:52:16.760]  You may think out of sight, out of mind
[03:52:16.760 --> 03:52:18.760]  and so you don't think you will be affected.
[03:52:18.760 --> 03:52:20.760]  The fact is, you are. We all are.
[03:52:20.760 --> 03:52:22.760]  Food shortages drive prices

[03:52:36.760 --> 03:52:38.760]  You can hope for the best, but hope
[03:52:38.760 --> 03:52:40.760]  won't feed you. Do what I've done and get your

[03:53:58.760 --> 03:54:00.760]  of clean water.
[03:54:28.760 --> 03:54:30.760]  Oh, Mike in New York's been holding
[03:54:30.760 --> 03:54:32.760]  for a while, I didn't even read the screen.
[03:54:32.760 --> 03:54:34.760]  Daughter taken due to owning guns.
[03:54:34.760 --> 03:54:36.760]  Mike in New York,
[03:54:36.760 --> 03:54:38.760]  wow, the child predators had
[03:54:38.760 --> 03:54:40.760]  their way with you. Tell us what happened, Mike.
[03:54:40.760 --> 03:54:42.760]  Yeah, thanks for taking my call,
[03:54:42.760 --> 03:54:44.760]  Alex. Well,
[03:54:44.760 --> 03:54:46.760]  it's a pretty long story, but I'll try to
[03:54:46.760 --> 03:54:48.760]  get to the point as fast as I can.
[03:54:48.760 --> 03:54:50.760]  I've been in and out of family court
[03:54:50.760 --> 03:54:52.760]  and my ex-wife's been trying
[03:54:52.760 --> 03:54:54.760]  to get my daughter away from me
[03:54:54.760 --> 03:54:56.760]  and finally found a way. My mom's
[03:54:56.760 --> 03:54:58.760]  a pistol permit holder
[03:54:58.760 --> 03:55:00.760]  and grew up in a family
[03:55:00.760 --> 03:55:02.760]  hunting all my life,
[03:55:02.760 --> 03:55:04.760]  exposed to guns all my life.
[03:55:04.760 --> 03:55:06.760]  No criminal background whatsoever. In fact,
[03:55:06.760 --> 03:55:08.760]  speeding tickets I can count on one hand
[03:55:08.760 --> 03:55:10.760]  how many I have. I'm an ex-vet
[03:55:10.760 --> 03:55:12.760]  which, thank God, they don't know about
[03:55:12.760 --> 03:55:14.760]  inside the court at this point.
[03:55:14.760 --> 03:55:16.760]  It's just, it's sick and
[03:55:16.760 --> 03:55:18.760]  perverted, Alex. Oh, I know.
[03:55:18.760 --> 03:55:20.760]  So, so they took your daughter
[03:55:20.760 --> 03:55:22.760]  because you own guns.
[03:55:22.760 --> 03:55:24.760]  That's the reason. They're demanding
[03:55:24.760 --> 03:55:26.760]  that I hand in a firearm that
[03:55:26.760 --> 03:55:28.760]  in fact was my
[03:55:28.760 --> 03:55:30.760]  father's who is now deceased
[03:55:30.760 --> 03:55:32.760]  and by law that goes
[03:55:32.760 --> 03:55:34.760]  to my mother who is
[03:55:34.760 --> 03:55:36.760]  next in line and I have two older brothers
[03:55:36.760 --> 03:55:38.760]  that are in line to actually
[03:55:38.760 --> 03:55:40.760]  receive that and they're demanding that I
[03:55:40.760 --> 03:55:42.760]  steal, in essence,
[03:55:42.760 --> 03:55:44.760]  this rifle from my mother
[03:55:44.760 --> 03:55:46.760]  to hand it in to them. So check
[03:55:46.760 --> 03:55:48.760]  this out to get my daughter two hours
[03:55:48.760 --> 03:55:50.760]  a week at a family center
[03:55:50.760 --> 03:55:52.760]  under supervised
[03:55:52.760 --> 03:55:54.760]  visitation because I'm a threat to
[03:55:54.760 --> 03:55:56.760]  society. Meanwhile, I have no record, like I
[03:55:56.760 --> 03:55:58.760]  said. Now
[03:55:58.760 --> 03:56:00.760]  has your daughter been handed over to the CPS
[03:56:00.760 --> 03:56:02.760]  PBPs, pot-bellied?
[03:56:02.760 --> 03:56:04.760]  My ex-wife has
[03:56:04.760 --> 03:56:06.760]  full custody over her right now. They took away
[03:56:06.760 --> 03:56:08.760]  all my parental rights.
[03:56:08.760 --> 03:56:10.760]  Okay, so that's what's happened. Yeah, they use that as a tool
[03:56:10.760 --> 03:56:12.760]  now. If the husband has guns
[03:56:12.760 --> 03:56:14.760]  in the divorce, the guns are
[03:56:14.760 --> 03:56:16.760]  automatically taken.
[03:56:16.760 --> 03:56:18.760]  That's what they're saying. They're not saying take guns for mentally
[03:56:18.760 --> 03:56:20.760]  ill people that have been adjudicated, you know, that think
[03:56:20.760 --> 03:56:22.760]  they're Saint Jerome, to quote
[03:56:22.760 --> 03:56:24.760]  Ghostbusters. They are
[03:56:24.760 --> 03:56:26.760]  doing this
[03:56:26.760 --> 03:56:28.760]  literally across
[03:56:28.760 --> 03:56:30.760]  the board and people, you know, I
[03:56:30.760 --> 03:56:32.760]  shot a special report last week, headline
[03:56:32.760 --> 03:56:34.760]  gun confiscation
[03:56:34.760 --> 03:56:36.760]  and mass arrest
[03:56:36.760 --> 03:56:38.760]  have begun and I explain
[03:56:38.760 --> 03:56:40.760]  it's going on everywhere but
[03:56:40.760 --> 03:56:42.760]  it's not being announced like it's a big deal. People are in
[03:56:42.760 --> 03:56:44.760]  the comments going, you fear-monger,
[03:56:44.760 --> 03:56:46.760]  there's no mass arrest. Folks,
[03:56:46.760 --> 03:56:48.760]  they are arresting millions
[03:56:48.760 --> 03:56:50.760]  of people a year for marijuana
[03:56:50.760 --> 03:56:52.760]  and tens of thousands
[03:56:52.760 --> 03:56:54.760]  have their kids taken permanently, I mean
[03:56:54.760 --> 03:56:56.760]  gone. Okay, I mean there are families
[03:56:56.760 --> 03:56:58.760]  on the run because they supposedly
[03:56:58.760 --> 03:57:00.760]  got caught with a bowl of marijuana, you know, engineer
[03:57:00.760 --> 03:57:02.760]  vets and I don't even believe
[03:57:02.760 --> 03:57:04.760]  that, folks. And again,
[03:57:04.760 --> 03:57:06.760]  I'm the first guy to give the, quote, police the
[03:57:06.760 --> 03:57:08.760]  benefit of the doubt but when the system's so corrupt
[03:57:08.760 --> 03:57:10.760]  that I grew up in Dallas
[03:57:10.760 --> 03:57:12.760]  where the sheriff later went to jail
[03:57:12.760 --> 03:57:14.760]  for drug dealing and that's when I was
[03:57:14.760 --> 03:57:16.760]  death-threaded over, was talking about it
[03:57:16.760 --> 03:57:18.760]  because I mean, you know, I didn't like drugs. I'd be at
[03:57:18.760 --> 03:57:20.760]  parties and drugs would be delivered by the cops
[03:57:20.760 --> 03:57:22.760]  and by sheriff's deputies
[03:57:22.760 --> 03:57:24.760]  and
[03:57:24.760 --> 03:57:26.760]  you know, it was just so insulting
[03:57:26.760 --> 03:57:28.760]  to have them then pull us and our buddies over
[03:57:28.760 --> 03:57:30.760]  and I don't want to get off into that whole story.
[03:57:30.760 --> 03:57:32.760]  I'm really sorry to hear,
[03:57:32.760 --> 03:57:34.760]  you know, the cops would pull us over, want to search the car
[03:57:34.760 --> 03:57:36.760]  and I'd go, you deal drugs. Well, we all went to
[03:57:36.760 --> 03:57:38.760]  jail, you know, it was just, I'm going to teach you
[03:57:38.760 --> 03:57:40.760]  respect, boy. Respect, you're a
[03:57:40.760 --> 03:57:42.760]  drug dealer in a
[03:57:42.760 --> 03:57:44.760]  in a
[03:57:44.760 --> 03:57:46.760]  monkey outfit
[03:57:46.760 --> 03:57:48.760]  in a Santa Claus outfit, in a Captain
[03:57:48.760 --> 03:57:50.760]  Crunch outfit. I mean,
[03:57:50.760 --> 03:57:52.760]  it's ridiculous, you dress up in
[03:57:52.760 --> 03:57:54.760]  a uniform even for a
[03:57:54.760 --> 03:57:56.760]  masquerade party and everybody kisses your rump.
[03:57:56.760 --> 03:57:58.760]  I mean, it's about what you
[03:57:58.760 --> 03:58:00.760]  stand for, what you
[03:58:00.760 --> 03:58:02.760]  people wear a suit and everybody suddenly
[03:58:02.760 --> 03:58:04.760]  you know, trust them.
[03:58:04.760 --> 03:58:06.760]  I apologize to all the callers that are
[03:58:06.760 --> 03:58:08.760]  holding, I've got to end this four-hour transmission
