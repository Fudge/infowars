[00:00.000 --> 00:12.600]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.600 --> 00:36.240]  he's alex jones on the gcn radio network and now live from austin texas alex jones
[00:36.240 --> 00:40.840]  well I've got to say it my head is spinning right now the news is just
[00:40.840 --> 00:50.200]  unbelievable off the charts right now on this Tuesday the 22nd day of July 2014
[00:50.200 --> 00:58.720]  global transmission we've got one guest joining us in the one o'clock hour and
[00:58.720 --> 01:04.080]  that is the mother of the man who's in jail accused of creating and running the
[01:04.080 --> 01:08.800]  silk road website and the reason that's so important she's in studio too isn't
[01:08.800 --> 01:17.440]  she on skype she's here in Austin is that they could say if someone was
[01:17.440 --> 01:23.000]  talking about violence on my message board on prisonplanet.com or commenting
[01:23.000 --> 01:28.840]  on info wars.com about violence that I'm guilty and that the whole media system
[01:28.840 --> 01:36.720]  is guilty here under this precedent they're trying to set and police have
[01:36.720 --> 01:40.960]  been caught especially in Seattle doing this even came out mainstream news the
[01:40.960 --> 01:46.240]  last decade quite a few times that the Seattle police would sell each other
[01:46.240 --> 01:52.920]  drugs and then have that sealed that a confidential informant would sell it to
[01:52.920 --> 01:59.400]  the officer to then get the bar or the restaurant and the restaurant was
[01:59.400 --> 02:04.080]  involved in no type of drug dealing and then the cops wouldn't even fence the
[02:04.080 --> 02:08.280]  the the seizure of the popular bar restaurant they would then personally
[02:08.280 --> 02:15.040]  own it while being police officers and it turned out over a hundred bars and
[02:15.040 --> 02:19.040]  restaurants were owned by cops that they'd stolen in Seattle and became a
[02:19.040 --> 02:25.800]  national scandal that's what this is but on the internet and it's very very very
[02:25.800 --> 02:30.040]  dangerous I knew a narcotics trafficking police officer when I grew up in
[02:30.040 --> 02:35.120]  Rockwall Texas outside Dallas I went to high school there three years and moved
[02:35.120 --> 02:45.880]  down here and he owned a bar that he'd taken from somebody and he was the guy
[02:45.880 --> 02:51.280]  running a bunch of the drugs so I personally experienced it and I wasn't
[02:51.280 --> 02:57.560]  even in the drug culture it's just that you you would see it go on and people
[02:57.560 --> 03:01.400]  talked and later a whole bunch of them did go to jail so that's not just
[03:01.400 --> 03:08.920]  speculation the feds busted them but that's the pot calling the kettle black
[03:08.920 --> 03:17.080]  the immigration news is off the charts insane the Middle East news is off the
[03:17.080 --> 03:22.760]  charts insane the shoot down of the airliner news is off the charts insane
[03:22.760 --> 03:32.480]  the Russian government has released the radar scans and data showing that there
[03:32.480 --> 03:42.160]  were fighter jets in and around the doomed passenger liner MH 17 and now Kiev
[03:42.160 --> 03:47.320]  has censored MH 17 air traffic control recordings security services confiscated
[03:47.320 --> 03:52.080]  tapes immediately after incident that is now confirmed mainstream news we're
[03:52.080 --> 03:59.040]  gonna be breaking that down coming up here today so I've been saying you know
[03:59.040 --> 04:02.720]  probably the Russians shot it down just because it is a war zone and they weren't
[04:02.720 --> 04:06.480]  supposed to fly in that area and everybody's been asking who has a brain
[04:06.480 --> 04:11.400]  between their their ears why was the plane to redirect with there and a lot
[04:11.400 --> 04:18.600]  of people helicopter pilots police officers air traffic controllers the
[04:18.600 --> 04:23.160]  last few days have been telling me on and off air that look I bet they had jets
[04:23.160 --> 04:28.160]  order it by radio or force it into that zone just because that's what
[04:28.160 --> 04:33.560]  experiences they've seen before and now that's coming out so that's why open the
[04:33.560 --> 04:37.040]  phones up to the former air traffic controllers current ones Air Force
[04:37.040 --> 04:42.760]  weapons systems people police officer helicopter pilots because they they know
[04:42.760 --> 04:47.680]  how stuff really works and that's what's coming out here and man if NATO was
[04:47.680 --> 04:51.640]  involved in this it they are just so evil because I can see the Russians
[04:51.640 --> 04:55.920]  shooting a plane down a war zone I must say it's a good thing but I mean stuff

[09:11.440 --> 09:15.560]  the headlines on CNBC I look on the headlines at drudge report.com
[09:15.560 --> 09:22.680]  world net daily countless other sites every night and every day and clearly
[09:22.680 --> 09:29.400]  what we're seeing is a world disintegrating on many fronts but for
[09:29.400 --> 09:32.480]  every action there's an equal and opposite reaction Newtonian physics
[09:32.480 --> 09:37.840]  there are a lot of good things happening as well a lot of renaissance as the old
[09:37.840 --> 09:44.280]  dinosaur media implodes the new true media is the is launching into a new
[09:44.280 --> 09:50.240]  golden age so take heart for all the negative things we talk about here
[09:50.240 --> 09:55.480]  there are so many good things happening as well look at these headlines at
[09:55.480 --> 10:02.200]  drudge report.com court rules Obamacare subsidies illegal and so I went to look
[10:02.200 --> 10:07.920]  what Obama was saying to check that out and he's saying oh don't worry the
[10:07.920 --> 10:18.840]  subsidies will just continue the subsidies are not going to stop many
[10:18.840 --> 10:23.360]  legal analysts are calling it a potentially crippling blow a massive
[10:23.360 --> 10:30.400]  setback premiums poised to spike for millions almost everyone I know at
[10:30.400 --> 10:33.560]  pre-existing conditions was kicked off their healthcare and can't get it now
[10:33.560 --> 10:39.680]  I told you it was written to put you on a death panel just like the veterans
[10:39.680 --> 10:44.960]  newspapers are claiming it's a wording glitch Obama law professor says I
[10:44.960 --> 10:49.360]  wouldn't bet on law survival of course it wouldn't survive if there was any
[10:49.360 --> 10:55.840]  justice in this country here's the problem Boehner every time something is
[10:55.840 --> 11:01.960]  found unconstitutional or found to be a total fraud or found to be completely
[11:01.960 --> 11:08.200]  wrecking the system by design goes in and says we'll just pass a amendment to
[11:08.200 --> 11:13.720]  quote fix it because the very same special interests that run Obama are
[11:13.720 --> 11:17.640]  the ones that wrote this bill this bipartisan nightmare bill written by
[11:17.640 --> 11:24.520]  the blue blood rhino neocon country club kleptocrat crony capitalist anti
[11:24.520 --> 11:33.440]  free market anti-gun knuckle dragon snot-nosed aliens and by the way I was
[11:33.440 --> 11:36.640]  introduced this last week into a term I didn't know about I mean I learned about
[11:36.640 --> 11:40.060]  Walmartians five six years ago with that popular website that shows all the
[11:40.060 --> 11:44.600]  bizarre weirdos with back breast and the rest of it at Walmart and people
[11:44.600 --> 11:50.000]  were all walking around in their underwear and I was introduced to a term
[11:50.000 --> 11:58.080]  called aliens and I said what's that an illegal alien and Anthony Gucci already
[11:58.080 --> 12:01.480]  said no no no and he gave me the exact term go ask him the exact term it's
[12:01.480 --> 12:05.840]  something alien and it's these trust fund multi-generational trust fund rich
[12:05.840 --> 12:12.920]  people who literally are completely disconnected from reality they don't have
[12:12.920 --> 12:19.760]  any social skills and they just wander around you know living in their mansions
[12:19.760 --> 12:23.720]  of their high-rise apartments and we'll just walk over to your table and start
[12:23.720 --> 12:28.000]  you know hitting on your girlfriend right in front of you and just have no
[12:28.000 --> 12:36.160]  connection to reality and don't realize how socially awkward and weird they are
[12:37.120 --> 12:41.560]  and now that all these trendies are moving to Austin all these trust fund
[12:41.560 --> 12:46.160]  people who have been on trust funds for 50 years and I'm meeting them and running
[12:46.160 --> 12:51.560]  into them as a Texan I'm not somebody who's been exposed to a lot of this and
[12:51.560 --> 12:57.560]  these are weirdos hey Alex yes the term is just aliens it's just aliens just
[12:57.560 --> 13:04.160]  aliens explains it all so you've heard of that too no Anthony pulled me in but
[13:04.160 --> 13:06.960]  then people were talking to have a dinner with they all knew they were called
[13:06.960 --> 13:11.440]  aliens and I guess that's just the younger varieties a trustifarian or you
[13:11.440 --> 13:19.680]  know trust baby well when they get older aliens exactly these Republicans are a
[13:19.680 --> 13:27.840]  bunch of disconnected aliens the the trust fund Republicans have no idea how
[13:27.840 --> 13:32.880]  much danger they're in and that when this system comes down they're not gonna
[13:32.880 --> 13:36.520]  be left alone by the Democrats they've made deals with underclaward and
[13:36.520 --> 13:43.840]  piven in the collapse of the society and these people are just as weird as the
[13:43.840 --> 13:51.400]  wall Martians and you've got all these billionaire and millionaire Democrats
[13:51.400 --> 13:55.120]  you know Democrats on average I just saw an article in the Wall Street Journal
[13:55.120 --> 13:58.680]  last week about it are richer and have more money than Republicans Hillary
[13:58.680 --> 14:02.560]  Clinton's worth hundreds of millions of dollars that we know of and then runs
[14:02.560 --> 14:07.360]  around giving speeches about how poor she is and again she made her money in
[14:07.360 --> 14:14.520]  inside swindles and cattle deals and and and frauds on record Bill Clinton in an
[14:14.520 --> 14:20.320]  audit last year spends 50 plus percent of the 20 30 40 million depending on the
[14:20.320 --> 14:28.360]  year money that comes into his stinking foundation and what does he pay for
[14:28.360 --> 14:36.880]  mansions and private jets get to pull the report up from last year we covered
[14:36.880 --> 14:41.840]  it I want to say he spent 15 million of it or something on just the jets alone
[14:41.840 --> 14:50.440]  15 million dollars on the jets to fly around to be paid 12 million dollars in
[14:50.440 --> 14:56.120]  speaking fees they just threw that headline up 12 million dollars in
[14:56.120 --> 15:00.360]  speaking fees and he won't even pay when he's going to get paid a million
[15:00.360 --> 15:07.240]  dollars as a delayed payoff to give a speaking you know event Bill Clinton
[15:07.240 --> 15:11.240]  Foundation has spent more than 15 million on travel expenses there you go
[15:11.240 --> 15:18.200]  New York Post but it was it was 15 million just last year to fly around and
[15:18.200 --> 15:23.640]  to be paid by governments and others a million dollars per speaking engagement
[15:23.640 --> 15:30.240]  Hillary's paid a couple hundred thousand and then the money to fly there comes
[15:30.240 --> 15:34.240]  from people that gave money to his foundation to help black Haitian
[15:34.240 --> 15:39.440]  children you're not helping black Haitian children you're helping Bill
[15:39.440 --> 15:45.440]  Clinton on a wide-body 50 million dollar jet with hookers you want to know
[15:45.440 --> 15:51.360]  your money for Haiti went it went to Bill Clinton on jets with hookers porn
[15:51.360 --> 15:58.440]  stars you name it that's where your money goes get that through your head and
[15:58.440 --> 16:02.840]  I'll hand it to me at least he's not raping women these days at least you
[16:02.840 --> 16:09.360]  know at least either piece paying them the point is I'm done with this fraud
[16:09.360 --> 16:18.960]  these people are disconnected from reality and are building a system you
[16:18.960 --> 16:24.440]  know I'm sorry it's it's a hundred six million they've been paid in speeches
[16:24.440 --> 16:28.440]  yeah I'm just going for memory Bill Clinton's hundred to six million dollar
[16:28.440 --> 16:35.640]  speech circuit windfall CNN that was a year ago the reason I'm throwing on
[16:35.640 --> 16:38.640]  different numbers of 15 million here 20 million there are 30 million there is
[16:38.640 --> 16:42.400]  different articles will quote different time periods and you know different
[16:42.400 --> 16:47.160]  areas does Bill Clinton have a secret blonde mistress code named Energizer I
[16:47.160 --> 16:55.200]  don't know to bears live in the woods I'm sorry I've got all this news and I've
[16:55.200 --> 17:01.680]  now gone off the reservation as usual how did I even get to this point the
[17:01.680 --> 17:06.880]  Democratic leadership the Republican leadership the whole system is
[17:06.880 --> 17:12.120]  disconnected there is a report out today from the Congressional Budget Office
[17:12.120 --> 17:16.720]  looking at the number of green cards that the Senate immigration bill would
[17:16.720 --> 17:23.560]  provide and it is enough to admit every single person in Honduras Guatemala and
[17:23.560 --> 17:31.520]  El Salvador folks that is twilight zone level there's already 30 million people
[17:31.520 --> 17:38.680]  here let's bring in 150 million the country will collapse before another 20
[17:38.680 --> 17:44.440]  million are brought in I mean this is a military attack on the country while
[17:44.440 --> 17:49.480]  Bill Clinton is flying around on luxury 50 million dollar jets costing 15
[17:49.480 --> 17:55.040]  million dollars a year loaded with hookers with money from little black
[17:55.040 --> 18:01.280]  kids stolen from little black kids I mean if there's a hot place in hell we
[18:01.280 --> 18:05.680]  know where he's going and it doesn't matter you go out of the average black
[18:05.680 --> 18:11.320]  person 90% vote for the Democrats and they'll say shut up crackerhead I love
[18:11.320 --> 18:16.560]  Bill Clinton you're just mad he's the first black president if you want to
[18:16.560 --> 18:21.360]  abort black people if you steal the money from the black babies if you are
[18:21.360 --> 18:27.000]  a total criminal who's a racist on record and part of the party that founded
[18:27.000 --> 18:33.000]  the Ku Klux Klan then you're loved by the average black person I mean I can't
[18:33.000 --> 18:36.960]  take it anymore if your organization was founded to fight the Ku Klux Klan like
[18:36.960 --> 18:42.200]  the NRA you're called by black commentators the KKK by Jamie Fox and
[18:42.200 --> 18:48.000]  everybody else I mean you talk about ignorant you talk about upside down you
[18:48.000 --> 18:54.400]  talk about screwed up you know how guilty I would be if I took any money for

[24:20.520 --> 24:29.960]  well let's look at some of the headlines up on info wars dot com before I get
[24:29.960 --> 24:33.960]  into some of the top stories that are incredibly important again Alex Jones
[24:33.960 --> 24:40.480]  here back live how Matt drudge changed the world that video special report we
[24:40.480 --> 24:45.920]  premiered here on the air yesterday is up on info wars dot com and prison
[24:45.920 --> 24:52.880]  wanted dot com as the top story right now with about 1800 comments on it and I
[24:52.880 --> 24:58.440]  wanted to do a whole article about it but I think we're gonna write that
[24:58.440 --> 25:04.520]  article and then add it to the video that drudge is top link to in the middle
[25:04.520 --> 25:10.120]  column at drudge report dot com and about 97% of people on YouTube voted it
[25:10.120 --> 25:20.960]  thumbs up but I noticed the 3% of trolls got very very very upset and we're like
[25:20.960 --> 25:25.000]  why are you groveling to Matt drudge why are you see they don't want us to
[25:25.000 --> 25:29.760]  celebrate victories we've had for freedom of the press because regardless
[25:29.760 --> 25:35.240]  what you think about Matt drudge he is a icon of the underdog being successful
[25:35.240 --> 25:42.560]  it's pure Americana American drink and we need to celebrate examples of where
[25:42.560 --> 25:49.040]  grassroots media supplanted state-run media and has the establishment pulling
[25:49.040 --> 25:55.360]  their hair out and I know I shouldn't respond to trolls but I just love
[25:55.360 --> 26:00.280]  explaining why I love to talk about our successes and other people's successes
[26:00.280 --> 26:07.240]  you see I revel in other people's successes I revel in an inventor coming
[26:07.240 --> 26:11.080]  up with a barret 50 cow on their garage and making billions of dollars I
[26:11.080 --> 26:15.920]  revel in someone coming up with a better sprocket and making billions of
[26:15.920 --> 26:20.160]  dollars I revel in someone riding a beautiful symphony and being celebrated
[26:20.160 --> 26:25.880]  I revel in someone coming up with a pacemaker that saves millions of lives
[26:25.880 --> 26:29.880]  when I see somebody with their private helicopter and their mansion on the
[26:29.880 --> 26:35.160]  hill who made their money the old-fashioned way producing things to
[26:35.160 --> 26:40.600]  empower humanity I absolutely celebrate them but I don't just celebrate the fact
[26:40.600 --> 26:49.920]  that they have bobbles I celebrate the fact that they are winners and did it
[26:49.920 --> 27:03.880]  swimming upstream and is the major icon of the new media Renaissance revolution
[27:03.880 --> 27:11.160]  like they call it Gutenberg's press because Gutenberg invented it when the
[27:11.160 --> 27:16.320]  histories are written if humanity survives drudge will be the central
[27:16.320 --> 27:26.920]  name the logo to a great extent the symbol of the beginning of the end of
[27:26.920 --> 27:34.240]  information control I mean that's a big deal and so we should do more videos
[27:34.240 --> 27:38.960]  celebrating that when I get Joseph Farah on and I celebrate the Western
[27:38.960 --> 27:42.200]  Journalism Center I mean it was at the top of the list of the Clinton enemies
[27:42.200 --> 27:50.080]  list to be shut down that was declassified this year and Joseph Farah
[27:50.080 --> 27:53.440]  has thousands of pages of it hasn't released it all yet because it's so
[27:53.440 --> 27:59.360]  damning and so dangerous they're worried about being sued the stuff in the
[27:59.360 --> 28:03.880]  names that are in there only 35 pages got released and it was shut down Joseph
[28:03.880 --> 28:08.840]  Farah shut down world net daily if they're able to grow the four world net
[28:08.840 --> 28:14.440]  daily this is like 93 94 if this happens the people will have control of
[28:14.440 --> 28:19.280]  information it will cause a revolution it will cause a Renaissance that will end
[28:19.280 --> 28:25.520]  our monopoly of information I mean those are quotes man this is heavy Hillary
[28:25.520 --> 28:29.720]  Clinton Bill Clinton wrote this thing it was sent out to the media to say when
[28:29.720 --> 28:32.800]  someone questions us you call them a conspiracy theorist you call them an
[28:32.800 --> 28:42.840]  extremist they still have that playbook today so I have world net daily on even
[28:42.840 --> 28:47.000]  though they're not perfect even though I don't agree with them on every issue they
[28:47.000 --> 28:50.600]  don't agree with me on every issue I'm not perfect I hear rebroadcast all the
[28:50.600 --> 28:53.240]  time where I disagree with what I've said because I didn't say it with the
[28:53.240 --> 29:01.360]  exact parlance that I intended I mean it's come out in political how the
[29:01.360 --> 29:05.680]  Clintons get people kicked off MSNBC that even mildly criticize them they're
[29:05.680 --> 29:11.740]  thugs they're scum when I admire trailblazers and I admire the real
[29:11.740 --> 29:19.480]  John Wayne type characters of this nation's history like George Washington I
[29:19.480 --> 29:26.000]  detest the polar opposite a 180 Hillary Clinton and people like that I mean
[29:26.000 --> 29:30.720]  there's no movies about George Washington folks because he was so epic how
[29:30.720 --> 29:35.640]  incredible he was they don't want you to know that you belong to something that
[29:35.640 --> 29:43.600]  cool I mean they made a movie about it was accurate it would be unbelievable so
[29:43.600 --> 29:47.520]  see we they don't want us celebrating our successes well you know what I'm gonna

[34:04.240 --> 34:10.320]  federal bills court panel says most obamacare sums of these illegal
[34:10.320 --> 34:13.520]  it's basically the federalization of state health care systems
[34:13.520 --> 34:19.280]  formerly run by the legislatures that's cnbc and obama's law firm has come out
[34:19.280 --> 34:23.440]  and said well we are just going to continue this that's what the president
[34:23.440 --> 34:30.240]  plans to do that's just some of the news on that front
[34:30.240 --> 34:36.640]  getting into the other incredible news that's up on info wars dot com and
[34:36.640 --> 34:40.720]  prisonplanet dot com
[34:40.720 --> 34:47.280]  gutierrez says to la raza obama promised to stop deportation of our people
[34:47.280 --> 34:51.440]  we're going to be playing that clip governor rick perry says he's going to
[34:51.440 --> 34:55.920]  send the national guard to the border and then i guess have them
[34:55.920 --> 34:59.600]  hand them over to ice who will then put them on buses and bust them into the
[34:59.600 --> 35:04.320]  country see that's the issue is that ice is
[35:04.320 --> 35:08.880]  over the deportation and they have stopped basically all
[35:08.880 --> 35:16.720]  deportations 99 of them have been stopped
[35:19.760 --> 35:24.400]  now continuing here ladies and gentlemen
[35:24.400 --> 35:29.120]  with what's unfolding with the border situation
[35:29.120 --> 35:32.960]  senate immigration bill would provide enough green cards
[35:32.960 --> 35:36.160]  to admit every single person in honduras
[35:36.160 --> 35:43.440]  Guatemala and al salvador hundreds of millions of people
[35:43.440 --> 35:46.800]  this is the complete end of the country and i know i just keep saying that but
[35:46.800 --> 35:51.280]  it's it's it's too amazing
[35:52.000 --> 35:55.200]  it is just too
[35:55.920 --> 36:01.280]  amazing that they're actually doing it
[36:01.280 --> 36:06.400]  and what we have is an incredibly blackmailed government
[36:06.400 --> 36:10.880]  we saw more nsa whistleblowers go public yesterday
[36:10.880 --> 36:18.240]  and document the fact that nsa intercepts illegally of all
[36:18.240 --> 36:25.680]  digital communications have been used for decades to blackmail
[36:25.680 --> 36:29.840]  you have to understand these systems are international
[36:29.840 --> 36:34.320]  that's why google and microsoft and atnt and verizon
[36:34.320 --> 36:37.840]  and these companies are more of the nsa and the nsa itself
[36:37.840 --> 36:41.840]  because they straddle national lines
[36:42.000 --> 36:47.360]  and they basically sell the data to the highest bidder or access to mining
[36:47.360 --> 36:50.880]  that data and here's a headline today book
[36:50.880 --> 36:56.640]  israelis tried to blackmail bill clinton with loinsky tape
[36:56.640 --> 37:03.680]  you see that's why our country is in so much
[37:03.680 --> 37:09.520]  trouble because we are just so incredibly corrupt
[37:09.520 --> 37:13.200]  and now the special interests are so reckless
[37:13.200 --> 37:17.680]  they're willing to bring in 30 million illegals
[37:17.680 --> 37:23.200]  give them id cards so they can vote and then try to bring another 30 40 50
[37:23.200 --> 37:26.240]  million they want to issue over 100 million
[37:26.240 --> 37:29.920]  green cards and the new senate bill
[37:29.920 --> 37:32.640]  the bills that bush brought forward and obama had brought forward have been
[37:32.640 --> 37:35.760]  basically the same bill in the last 10 years
[37:35.760 --> 37:39.280]  they've done it five different times three times under bush now twice under
[37:39.280 --> 37:43.760]  obama and it it lets everybody who's here
[37:43.760 --> 37:49.680]  then bring family members in so by fiat outside of law because they can't
[37:49.680 --> 37:54.560]  pass that that law that bill if you've got family in the
[37:54.560 --> 37:58.000]  us you just tell the board patrol i've got family
[37:58.000 --> 38:04.160]  and say st louis missouri when you come into mcowen texas or brownsville
[38:04.160 --> 38:08.400]  and they say okay here's your unlimited voucher
[38:08.400 --> 38:16.560]  to go wherever you want in the us just an open check on greyhound
[38:16.560 --> 38:21.600]  and they hand you the voucher and they'll take any idea you've got any
[38:21.600 --> 38:25.520]  consul matricula you name it i remember having the leader of the
[38:25.520 --> 38:28.720]  republican senate on like eight nine years ago from colorada
[38:28.720 --> 38:31.440]  he'd done a stunt in the Denver Post reported on it
[38:31.440 --> 38:36.640]  where he went out in one day and got four consul matriculas himself
[38:36.640 --> 38:40.480]  under different names at the mexican consulate
[38:41.440 --> 38:45.280]  or mexican embassy
[38:45.760 --> 38:49.520]  you go down to houston you go to dallas there's big giant buildings with big
[38:49.520 --> 38:52.960]  mexican flags flying on the top of them and just huge parking lots full of
[38:52.960 --> 38:57.280]  people just going in getting any name they want
[38:58.080 --> 39:02.800]  and by the way mexico runs like this mexico has collapsed
[39:02.800 --> 39:06.800]  they say cancun's not even safe to go to anymore travel advisories
[39:06.800 --> 39:10.400]  the entire place i was in mexico four years ago
[39:10.400 --> 39:13.920]  the last time let me tell you it was scary
[39:14.160 --> 39:19.360]  i was in kozumel where i'd probably been 20 times before
[39:19.360 --> 39:23.200]  and it was scary
[39:23.600 --> 39:29.200]  and then we got off in southern mexico to go uh see some pyramids and it was
[39:29.200 --> 39:34.400]  scary and it hadn't been scary like that even 10 years ago
[39:34.400 --> 39:38.320]  i remember the bus being pulled over the turbos and mexican trips demanding
[39:38.320 --> 39:40.560]  money
[39:41.680 --> 39:45.840]  from the bus driver who then cried and gave them
[39:45.840 --> 39:51.280]  his day's tips from three different trips out to the pyramids
[39:52.000 --> 39:58.960]  that's mexico and we're now going to live like that
[40:00.880 --> 40:05.200]  why are all these people fleeing the third world because it's the third world
[40:05.200 --> 40:10.160]  and by every measurement every sociological measurement look it up
[40:10.160 --> 40:15.200]  the united states is now a third world country in most areas
[40:15.200 --> 40:18.480]  look it up the united states trails last in income
[40:18.480 --> 40:23.040]  last in education last in test scores we are a third world country
[40:23.040 --> 40:29.280]  california is going to be the next mexico city
[40:29.680 --> 40:34.320]  mexico city was the staging ground from central and south america and southern
[40:34.320 --> 40:40.080]  mexico it was only 10 million people in 1980 mexico
[40:40.080 --> 40:47.200]  city is now estimated at 35 million people
[40:49.040 --> 40:51.920]  and now they've moved them to the maquiladoras and now they're being moved
[40:51.920 --> 40:55.920]  into the us and then they will pivot and bring in their families 30 million is
[40:55.920 --> 41:02.000]  60 million they bring in their families 90 million they bring in their families
[41:02.000 --> 41:07.440]  180 million people within 10 years and that's in the senate bill
[41:07.440 --> 41:13.760]  180 million people
[41:14.400 --> 41:20.320]  in the next 10 years or the new birth rate of latin america
[41:20.320 --> 41:28.400]  over the next decade transferred to us game over the new world order means to
[41:28.400 --> 41:31.200]  conquer us they use isis to bring down the
[41:31.200 --> 41:34.560]  middle east and al-qaeda they use the former
[41:34.560 --> 41:39.520]  nazis to bring down the ukraine overthrow it
[41:39.520 --> 41:43.280]  and we're being conquered right now
[41:43.440 --> 41:49.840]  and if rick perry just sends some people down to the border
[41:50.160 --> 41:55.200]  and engages in some uh grandstanding
[41:57.920 --> 42:02.080]  that is not going to be enough
[42:02.080 --> 42:07.360]  it's not going to be enough to have some national guards stand around the border
[42:07.360 --> 42:14.240]  and then uh apprehend semi-legals and then give them the eyes who then put
[42:14.240 --> 42:18.320]  some on buses and i don't even have the money or the reporters
[42:18.320 --> 42:21.520]  just send reporters to all of this in arizona and texas but we're going to
[42:21.520 --> 42:25.440]  send our reporters back out to cover the supposed national guard
[42:25.440 --> 42:29.440]  and to go back to the place where the buses come in to videotape that and
[42:29.440 --> 42:33.360]  show it's still going on and our ice whistleblower tells us it's
[42:33.360 --> 42:38.640]  still going on every day in multiple cities in texas alone
[42:38.640 --> 42:43.280]  and it's going on in california and it's going on in arizona
[42:43.280 --> 42:48.160]  and if sheriff arpaio tries to stop them the fed suing and swat team rate them
[42:48.160 --> 42:51.120]  and search through all their goods this is what our country
[42:51.120 --> 42:57.840]  has turned into ladies and gentlemen here's the headline cbs news governor
[42:57.840 --> 43:16.080]  rick perry deploying up to 1 000 national guard troops to border
[43:16.080 --> 43:20.000]  we'll be covering more of that coming up
[43:20.000 --> 43:23.600]  budget to transport illegals across the usa approaches
[43:23.600 --> 43:30.640]  $100 million and that's just been this summer
[43:30.640 --> 43:34.400]  they already want another 3.7 billion because they're going to run out early
[43:34.400 --> 43:41.600]  of the 2015 budget that's 5.508 billion and that's from
[43:41.600 --> 43:47.440]  the senate appropriations committee with that information
[43:47.440 --> 43:50.640]  again louis gutierrez i'm going to play this uh clip in a minute
[43:50.640 --> 43:54.880]  to la raza obama assured steps to take
[43:54.880 --> 44:00.240]  the deportation of our people to stop it of our people
[44:00.240 --> 44:04.160]  you mean anybody who's got brown skin from south of the border
[44:04.160 --> 44:08.320]  is now the people under the democratic party who then get free goodies if they
[44:08.320 --> 44:12.160]  vote for gun control and socialism and obama cared
[44:12.160 --> 44:20.080]  rob everybody this is a political takeover ladies and gentlemen
[44:20.080 --> 44:23.520]  and of course this is the new political ruling class
[44:23.520 --> 44:26.240]  and it's not based on private property or the family
[44:26.240 --> 44:31.120]  or the right to self-defense it is based on leftist ideology
[44:31.120 --> 44:35.360]  that flies completely in the face
[44:37.920 --> 44:43.920]  of what i would call his panic culture that's pro family pro private property
[44:43.920 --> 44:47.840]  pro male role models female role models traditional stuff
[44:47.840 --> 44:51.920]  it's all run by these weird little socialist
[44:51.920 --> 44:56.880]  globalist foundation creatures that professor homo moto who heads up his
[44:56.880 --> 45:01.360]  uc davis sociology department
[45:05.280 --> 45:08.640]  he's pointing out i mean he's he's he's from the rockefeller foundation
[45:08.640 --> 45:12.240]  he's an insider he's gotten awards from the system that this is a political
[45:12.240 --> 45:14.560]  takeover
[45:14.560 --> 45:19.840]  because we're a democracy now not a republic if 51% vote to make the 49%
[45:19.840 --> 45:24.480]  slaves according to the democrats that happens now in a republic
[45:24.480 --> 45:28.000]  you can get 51% of people to vote to ban guns it doesn't happen
[45:28.000 --> 45:31.520]  because you can't get rid of free speech or the right to defense
[45:31.520 --> 45:35.600]  or the right to private property or the right to a jury or a right to not be
[45:35.600 --> 45:38.800]  incriminated or a right to not have your house searched without warrants
[45:38.800 --> 45:42.080]  all those things are on the wayside right now and by the way they don't have
[45:42.080 --> 45:45.040]  that in latin america they don't have any of that except
[45:45.040 --> 45:47.920]  maybe in chili
[45:48.800 --> 45:55.440]  irs seeks help destroying another 3200 hard drives
[45:58.160 --> 46:04.000]  so they're still destroying everything uh engaging in the takeover
[46:04.000 --> 46:07.040]  here's another one on the border situation again i mentioned this but i
[46:07.040 --> 46:11.200]  want to read from it now governor rick perry deploying up to 1000
[46:11.200 --> 46:14.800]  national guard troops to the border governor rick perry
[46:14.800 --> 46:18.880]  announced last night that he is activating up to 1000 national guard
[46:18.880 --> 46:22.080]  troops to the us-mexico border as he
[46:22.080 --> 46:25.600]  accused the federal government of offering lip service on border security
[46:25.600 --> 46:29.040]  go all the way perry they're shipping them in the buses into the country
[46:29.040 --> 46:32.480]  part of the takeover they've ended deportations effectively
[46:32.480 --> 46:35.760]  except for super hardcore felons and most of those have stopped
[46:35.760 --> 46:38.480]  the announcement comes as the obama administration is still struggling to
[46:38.480 --> 46:42.400]  deal with influx of more than 50 000 unaccompanied
[46:42.400 --> 46:46.320]  miners it's about 100 000 a month we know of folks
[46:46.320 --> 46:49.680]  that's just the miners they count it's adults women children you name it
[46:49.680 --> 46:53.760]  seek as the miners then shut down the system most from central america
[46:53.760 --> 46:57.920]  who have crossed the united states in the past year the additional resources
[46:57.920 --> 47:01.040]  are not aimed at the children themselves perry said describing them
[47:01.040 --> 47:03.760]  instead as force multiplier to help the texas
[47:03.760 --> 47:08.080]  department of public safety combat the brutal drug cartels
[47:08.080 --> 47:12.000]  that are preying upon our communities
[47:12.000 --> 47:16.240]  well i know the guards been down there before and i know they don't shoot back
[47:16.240 --> 47:20.080]  when the cartels shoot at them and i know the state police haven't been
[47:20.080 --> 47:25.600]  shooting back they've been getting their boats shot up
[47:25.600 --> 47:29.600]  this country just abs no other country bends over like this i mean that's all i
[47:29.600 --> 47:33.280]  can say because it's part of the plan you want to
[47:33.280 --> 47:37.600]  grease the skids to implode the country now let's play this clip where
[47:37.600 --> 47:42.080]  representative lewis gutierrez the democrat of illinois
[47:42.080 --> 47:46.400]  said president barack obama's deferred action for childhood arrivals program
[47:46.400 --> 47:50.160]  was a down payment to the hispanic community before more grants of amnesty
[47:50.160 --> 47:53.680]  for illegal immigrants it is de facto legalization they won't have
[47:53.680 --> 47:59.360]  immigration hearings for five years they get given drivers license
[47:59.360 --> 48:03.200]  in in colorada and california other places it's a game over
[48:03.200 --> 48:08.000]  in illinois and notice it's our people they're branding it this is our
[48:08.000 --> 48:13.440]  psychology works that if you are hispanic you support wide open borders
[48:13.440 --> 48:19.200]  and the democratic party and turning your guns in
[48:19.200 --> 48:23.520]  so this new political class of el jefez can turn us
[48:23.520 --> 48:27.040]  into a mixture of guatemala mexico and venezuela
[48:27.040 --> 48:32.400]  i mean have you been to venezuela folks i've been to guatemala and honduras and
[48:32.400 --> 48:36.160]  let me tell you they're scary
[48:40.000 --> 48:42.560]  let's go ahead and go to gutierrez here's the club
[48:42.560 --> 48:46.320]  and you see that there is no progress on the issue it's time for the president
[48:46.320 --> 48:50.080]  of the united states to step forward because the power to
[48:50.080 --> 48:58.000]  to stop deportations and uh and uh we will fight if i don't want to go i
[48:58.000 --> 49:03.760]  would like to stay here i this is chicago i'm part of chicago
[49:03.760 --> 49:10.480]  and this is the genius of it they've got these people fleeing desperate
[49:10.480 --> 49:14.080]  nations who just want like living here and i get it compared to where they
[49:14.080 --> 49:19.280]  came from but they're politically handled by monsters
[49:19.280 --> 49:24.240]  by the big chicago crime syndicate by the new york crime syndicate by the la
[49:24.240 --> 49:28.400]  crime syndicate they're being used and the country will be collapsed
[49:28.400 --> 49:31.760]  so he's in a life boat and what i'd like to stay
[49:31.760 --> 49:35.040]  to put a human face on it
[49:35.840 --> 49:39.760]  but you need to free latin america you need to put in economic development
[49:39.760 --> 49:43.440]  there but the imf world bank goes oh we
[49:43.440 --> 49:46.960]  understand that mr johns we want to do that but now they want to put money into
[49:46.960 --> 49:51.440]  again to centralize systems that only make things worse the globalist want us
[49:51.440 --> 49:54.480]  poor and bankrupted they've done this on purpose in africa and
[49:54.480 --> 49:59.600]  latin america and asia i've interviewed the top technicians involved in it
[49:59.600 --> 50:02.480]  i've interviewed the former chief economist of the world bank
[50:02.480 --> 50:07.360]  joseph sticklas i've interviewed john perkins who was a economic hitman
[50:07.360 --> 50:11.040]  over whole countries he would go in and meet with the presidents and say
[50:11.040 --> 50:14.160]  you either take this billion dollars in a swiss bank account or we're going to
[50:14.160 --> 50:18.400]  kill you is that clear and if they didn't sign
[50:18.400 --> 50:21.360]  over all the infrastructure and then double and triple prices and break the
[50:21.360 --> 50:24.480]  country down with a list of demands that would
[50:24.480 --> 50:28.320]  make the country go bankrupt so the globals would have a permanent
[50:28.320 --> 50:32.240]  poor client state they would kill the president or prime minister
[50:32.240 --> 50:38.640]  or have the u.s army or marine corps invade or fund rebels
[50:39.920 --> 50:43.440]  you understand that and people go yes the america is evil and then and then
[50:43.440 --> 50:46.640]  and then americans get blamed for it no no no we're under the same thing
[50:46.640 --> 50:50.160]  they're going to do this here now mark my words
[50:50.160 --> 50:53.600]  and look i'm smart i'll be fine throughout all this
[50:53.600 --> 50:57.200]  but the general public just trying to work and live you're screwed okay

[01:00:56.480 --> 01:01:00.080]  what do you think of rick perry saying he's going to put a thousand
[01:01:00.080 --> 01:01:07.360]  national guard on the texas border because obama quote
[01:01:07.360 --> 01:01:11.440]  doesn't know what he's doing no no obama knows exactly
[01:01:11.440 --> 01:01:16.000]  what he's doing and he says they're there just to help the border patrol and
[01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:20.240]  help the state police he said that obama's
[01:01:20.240 --> 01:01:25.040]  paying lip service no he's not he's crushing the border ending america as we
[01:01:25.040 --> 01:01:27.760]  know it and bringing us into the north american union
[01:01:27.760 --> 01:01:31.280]  and then merging that with failed central america this is a
[01:01:31.280 --> 01:01:34.800]  form of siege on the country clowered and piven
[01:01:34.800 --> 01:01:38.400]  that's what we need to hear from rick perry
[01:01:38.400 --> 01:01:46.560]  and then have trucks load the illegals up
[01:01:47.360 --> 01:01:52.560]  and drive them up to the mexico border right there on the bridge and dump them
[01:01:52.560 --> 01:01:56.480]  out and then not let them go back by and let a huge crisis start and let the
[01:01:56.480 --> 01:02:00.000]  whole world see the border is collapsed and that the mexican
[01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:03.840]  troops will try to push them back over escalated into a crisis
[01:02:03.840 --> 01:02:08.320]  that's what obama's done creating the crisis hoping now that we all just
[01:02:08.320 --> 01:02:12.400]  let let this collapse accelerate
[01:02:12.400 --> 01:02:17.200]  mean ladies and gentlemen central and south america are in total collapse
[01:02:17.200 --> 01:02:21.520]  and they're opening up a condo it a corridor
[01:02:21.520 --> 01:02:25.440]  to bring down the united states that is not rhetoric
[01:02:25.440 --> 01:02:30.160]  we are red level emergency right now
[01:02:31.520 --> 01:02:34.400]  and then under political correctness is everything's going bankrupt and cities
[01:02:34.400 --> 01:02:37.120]  are full of hundreds of thousands of illegals of peace begging for
[01:02:37.120 --> 01:02:40.320]  everything the system will use them as a
[01:02:40.320 --> 01:02:44.560]  political football and will also exploit them to drive down wages
[01:02:44.560 --> 01:02:47.840]  and will exploit them to be a desperate political clasps
[01:02:47.840 --> 01:02:52.880]  totally dependent on them segregation was a great evil
[01:02:52.880 --> 01:02:56.720]  but under it that which does not kill you only makes you stronger
[01:02:56.720 --> 01:02:59.760]  black communities in many areas were becoming as wealthy
[01:02:59.760 --> 01:03:06.720]  or more wealthy than the white areas by the 1950s blacks basically owned
[01:03:06.720 --> 01:03:10.880]  their own universities all over the country
[01:03:10.880 --> 01:03:15.440]  their own restaurants hotels businesses
[01:03:15.440 --> 01:03:19.680]  and the segregation had made them wealthy
[01:03:20.320 --> 01:03:25.680]  the democrats switched from being the klan to embracing them on record
[01:03:25.680 --> 01:03:30.000]  and domesticated them with welfare and now blacks
[01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:34.080]  on average live in third world conditions in this country and have almost
[01:03:34.080 --> 01:03:37.840]  90% of legitimacy everyone knows the numbers
[01:03:37.840 --> 01:03:42.800]  so you take people from suits and ties owning their own businesses very proud
[01:03:42.800 --> 01:03:46.480]  of themselves being very successful under open
[01:03:46.480 --> 01:03:51.760]  attack in many areas of the country
[01:03:52.880 --> 01:03:59.920]  to now being failed failed on average that's the
[01:03:59.920 --> 01:04:06.560]  plan for everybody you look at these trust fund kids
[01:04:06.560 --> 01:04:10.640]  they're failed i run into rich hispanic trust fund kids
[01:04:10.640 --> 01:04:16.960]  they're failed snot noses run to which rich white trust funds snot noses
[01:04:16.960 --> 01:04:22.000]  they're failed but they're not failed in a ghetto with a gun
[01:04:22.960 --> 01:04:25.040]  i'm not saying everybody with trust funds bad but everybody knows the
[01:04:25.040 --> 01:04:28.640]  statistics prosperity ladies and gentlemen creates
[01:04:28.640 --> 01:04:32.160]  monsters adversity creates men
[01:04:32.880 --> 01:04:36.640]  and that is the great paradox of liberty
[01:04:36.640 --> 01:04:39.840]  is that as we create liberty it then creates slobs
[01:04:39.840 --> 01:04:43.040]  within except tyranny so i want to give the number out
[01:04:43.040 --> 01:04:46.320]  to get your take on rick perry and what he should do about the border
[01:04:46.320 --> 01:04:50.400]  and how we put pressure on him and where you think all this is going
[01:04:50.400 --> 01:04:53.760]  i think it's going according to the globalist plan 800
[01:04:53.760 --> 01:05:01.280]  259 92 31 800 25 9 9 2 3 1 city of austin tap water

[01:08:27.280 --> 01:08:32.560]  they plan on over 100 million green cards in the new senate immigration bill
[01:08:32.560 --> 01:08:37.280]  that's directly from the senate budget office
[01:08:37.280 --> 01:08:40.720]  and the committee handling it
[01:08:41.040 --> 01:08:45.120]  they are advertising the borders up and worldwide
[01:08:45.120 --> 01:08:50.640]  as a fiat amnesty to implode the country and bankrupt the nation
[01:08:50.640 --> 01:08:56.080]  and the waves of illegals are only expanding and accelerating
[01:08:56.080 --> 01:08:59.360]  if the next few waves are allowed in in the next few months
[01:08:59.360 --> 01:09:02.480]  it will set the precedent the numbers will be so overwhelming
[01:09:02.480 --> 01:09:06.560]  we won't ever be able to basically stop it
[01:09:08.240 --> 01:09:13.920]  and then it's political suicide for anyone who wants to have a stable
[01:09:13.920 --> 01:09:19.840]  country now if you are the globalist you love it
[01:09:19.840 --> 01:09:23.680]  because you live in luxembourg switzerland or london
[01:09:23.680 --> 01:09:27.120]  or paris and and you live in big armored fortresses and you don't care
[01:09:27.120 --> 01:09:31.440]  you fly to work on helicopters just like the elite of mexico like carlo
[01:09:31.440 --> 01:09:35.280]  slim who made his money out of monopolies
[01:09:35.280 --> 01:09:42.560]  and out of globalist deals and out of the big banks and the money laundering
[01:09:43.840 --> 01:09:48.640]  so this is a mobster system that we're going into
[01:09:48.640 --> 01:09:53.600]  headlong and i don't know who put up the white flags on the brooklyn bridge
[01:09:53.600 --> 01:09:58.480]  today but it was dramatic and it's got the whole city of
[01:09:58.480 --> 01:10:03.520]  more than 10 million people this is 18 million the whole metro area
[01:10:03.520 --> 01:10:08.080]  talking about why is there white flags flying over the brooklyn bridge
[01:10:08.080 --> 01:10:12.400]  and then anti-terrorism teams went up the flags were up there for
[01:10:12.400 --> 01:10:15.040]  two hours
[01:10:16.560 --> 01:10:22.160]  and everyone's saying what does it mean well a black flag means no surrender
[01:10:22.160 --> 01:10:29.840]  a black flag with a skull on it means no surrender no quarter given
[01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:35.200]  it means if you capture us you need to kill us and if we capture you we're
[01:10:35.200 --> 01:10:38.640]  going to kill you and then they started adding
[01:10:38.640 --> 01:10:42.320]  other things to the skull and crossbones to mean that we will
[01:10:42.320 --> 01:10:48.160]  torture you as well but that's where the black flag comes
[01:10:48.160 --> 01:10:52.800]  from it predates the pirates of the caribbean a good thousand years
[01:10:52.800 --> 01:10:58.880]  that's why al-qaeda uses a black flag the white flag everybody knows what that
[01:10:58.880 --> 01:11:02.480]  means it means we surrender
[01:11:03.760 --> 01:11:08.160]  we surrender unconditionally
[01:11:08.160 --> 01:11:17.280]  or it can mean you wish to parlay or have a conversation
[01:11:19.120 --> 01:11:23.280]  and i would guess this was put up there because the country is wide open right
[01:11:23.280 --> 01:11:28.800]  now and by every yardstick we are in a crisis
[01:11:28.800 --> 01:11:32.800]  that's why i think it's fine to have micro fm stations in cities
[01:11:32.800 --> 01:11:37.280]  as long as they don't interfere with other stations and private property
[01:11:37.280 --> 01:11:40.480]  because we're our nation is under attack and being destroyed
[01:11:40.480 --> 01:11:45.200]  there won't be any future of freema the press if we don't stand together now
[01:11:45.200 --> 01:11:48.640]  that's why it's time for civil disobedience you decide what should be
[01:11:48.640 --> 01:11:52.960]  done yourself but projecting things up on the
[01:11:52.960 --> 01:11:57.200]  side of big buildings at big public events
[01:11:57.200 --> 01:12:01.040]  parachuting into public events to get attention like lord montan did
[01:12:01.040 --> 01:12:04.320]  at the big un power grab meeting in durban south africa
[01:12:04.320 --> 01:12:10.320]  when they were censoring free speech running up white flags so that then
[01:12:10.320 --> 01:12:14.240]  when the local town asked why later you mail a letter in
[01:12:14.240 --> 01:12:18.240]  showing a photograph of you doing it with your back turned or whatever
[01:12:18.240 --> 01:12:21.920]  or saying who you are running it up on the police station
[01:12:21.920 --> 01:12:25.600]  running it up at the city council running it up at the post office
[01:12:25.600 --> 01:12:29.520]  i mean the illegals have been pulling down american flags
[01:12:29.520 --> 01:12:34.160]  running up mexican flags for about 10 years they get it
[01:12:34.160 --> 01:12:37.440]  so what you do is you you hang the the american flag upside down
[01:12:37.440 --> 01:12:41.360]  but above it the white flag if you really want to get it right
[01:12:41.360 --> 01:12:46.560]  america's into stress we've effectively surrendered
[01:12:46.560 --> 01:12:52.720]  american flag on bottom upside down or your state flag on bottom upside down
[01:12:52.720 --> 01:12:56.640]  and i know america has been bad and hadn't been perfect but we had some
[01:12:56.640 --> 01:13:00.240]  ideas that the globalists want to get rid of and everybody wanted to come here
[01:13:00.240 --> 01:13:04.000]  because we were exceptional we're now exceptionally
[01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:10.160]  corrupt exceptionally pathetic exceptionally evil
[01:13:10.160 --> 01:13:14.960]  exceptionally mesmerized in a trance state
[01:13:14.960 --> 01:13:19.680]  obsessed with things that don't matter i mean when a grown man when i'm at the
[01:13:19.680 --> 01:13:23.920]  gym comes over and goes hey uh what you think of the
[01:13:23.920 --> 01:13:27.840]  baseball game last night of the football game i go sorry i just don't have time to
[01:13:27.840 --> 01:13:31.120]  follow it and i look at you like you're weird
[01:13:31.120 --> 01:13:34.400]  and i'll say man you know the whole country's collapsing i'm just trying to
[01:13:34.400 --> 01:13:38.240]  protect myself my family and warn others it's like weird and
[01:13:38.240 --> 01:13:42.080]  extraordinary to be informed people are like
[01:13:42.080 --> 01:13:45.200]  these people ask oh you aren't you that radio tv guy
[01:13:45.200 --> 01:13:48.640]  yeah it's kind of weird what you talk about it's kind of scary i don't
[01:13:48.640 --> 01:13:52.400]  i don't think i like to focus on negative things and i'm like yeah well
[01:13:52.400 --> 01:13:56.640]  that's why we're in so much trouble you know i get it
[01:13:56.640 --> 01:14:02.080]  i could pull up anchor and live pretty cheap in some south pacific island and
[01:14:02.080 --> 01:14:06.400]  go buy a dive shop just as a front for the
[01:14:06.400 --> 01:14:10.480]  fact that i'm really a political person you know uh running from
[01:14:10.480 --> 01:14:14.560]  persecution and just have a little business
[01:14:14.560 --> 01:14:21.840]  and rent out scuba gear to people and just watch the world burn
[01:14:21.840 --> 01:14:26.640]  and so so i get
[01:14:27.680 --> 01:14:35.360]  i get why you think it's a loser mentality to be involved or care
[01:14:35.360 --> 01:14:38.800]  it's people that cared that built this country
[01:14:38.800 --> 01:14:42.160]  it's people that stood up for ideas and values are willing to die for it
[01:14:42.160 --> 01:14:48.400]  that beat the that defeated the greatest empire the world had ever seen
[01:14:48.400 --> 01:14:51.440]  and that's why that history is not even taught anymore because they don't want
[01:14:51.440 --> 01:14:54.880]  you to know why you were exceptional they've taught you you're exceptional
[01:14:54.880 --> 01:15:00.080]  because you drink like beer wear leave eyes and watch nfl football
[01:15:00.080 --> 01:15:03.760]  they taught you you're exceptional
[01:15:04.960 --> 01:15:10.800]  because you love barack obama they taught you you're exceptional
[01:15:10.800 --> 01:15:14.800]  because you buy into the republicans and john mccain
[01:15:14.800 --> 01:15:19.680]  know what you are is people living in a house living in a fortress
[01:15:19.680 --> 01:15:23.840]  living in a system that had the most inventions the most science the most
[01:15:23.840 --> 01:15:30.240]  trailblazers the toughest fighters the best people in the world
[01:15:30.240 --> 01:15:35.200]  on average were in this country and nobody wanted to mess with us
[01:15:35.200 --> 01:15:41.600]  because we came from slaves and indentured servants and political prisoners
[01:15:41.600 --> 01:15:45.520]  and soldiers and fighters and inventors and farmers
[01:15:45.520 --> 01:15:50.560]  and people that couldn't be free in europe and other parts of the world
[01:15:50.560 --> 01:15:56.320]  who came here in the bottom of wooden ships with rats and sewage
[01:15:56.320 --> 01:16:01.680]  to then carve out a new world in the middle of native tribes that were
[01:16:01.680 --> 01:16:05.280]  killing each other 24-7
[01:16:09.760 --> 01:16:13.680]  your ancestors are people that would crowd on ships when about
[01:16:13.680 --> 01:16:18.240]  a third of them were getting lost and would come across the ocean
[01:16:18.240 --> 01:16:21.920]  and a third of the people sometimes more would die on the ship look it up
[01:16:21.920 --> 01:16:26.240]  you were black more than half and you got here and you survived and you lived
[01:16:26.240 --> 01:16:30.320]  and your your ancestors were tough as nails
[01:16:30.400 --> 01:16:34.000]  and now look what you've become look what i've become
[01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:41.200]  what have i become my sweetest friend everyone i know
[01:16:41.200 --> 01:16:47.920]  goes away in the end and you could have it all
[01:16:47.920 --> 01:16:56.880]  my empire of dirt i will let you in i will make you hurt
[01:16:57.920 --> 01:17:03.200]  and now we're at the end of the republic and the fall of the empire has just
[01:17:03.200 --> 01:17:08.480]  begun the long slide into third world
[01:17:08.480 --> 01:17:12.400]  overlaid with technocratic hell
[01:17:13.120 --> 01:17:16.560]  we're gonna go to eric daniel fred chris tim and others
[01:17:16.560 --> 01:17:22.160]  we come back in the next segment but you are seeing just the epic fall of our
[01:17:22.160 --> 01:17:25.600]  country and the republican leadership rick
[01:17:25.600 --> 01:17:28.960]  perry's being praised by republicans
[01:17:28.960 --> 01:17:33.760]  who he's getting tough with obama saying obama's paying lip service to border
[01:17:33.760 --> 01:17:36.560]  security
[01:17:36.560 --> 01:17:41.520]  obama set a plan with the mexican and guatemalan president
[01:17:41.520 --> 01:17:46.240]  to open a corridor up with more than 15 trains a day
[01:17:46.240 --> 01:17:49.760]  it's 15 on average with thousands per train
[01:17:49.760 --> 01:17:54.080]  up to the country and aircraft landing at military bases authorized to then
[01:17:54.080 --> 01:17:57.600]  ship the illegals all over the country
[01:17:58.480 --> 01:18:02.400]  but the public says there's a crisis we don't know what to do
[01:18:02.400 --> 01:18:08.080]  so rick perry will deploy the national guard to deliver the illegals to ice to
[01:18:08.080 --> 01:18:10.960]  give them bus tickets
[01:18:11.680 --> 01:18:15.280]  so i'm going to put a bounty out
[01:18:16.240 --> 01:18:20.720]  five thousand dollars to whoever gets the footage in the interviews
[01:18:20.720 --> 01:18:27.520]  of the border patrol and the national guard in texas delivering the
[01:18:27.520 --> 01:18:33.920]  illegals to ice then you stake out the ice
[01:18:33.920 --> 01:18:37.200]  facility they were they release them in buses at night
[01:18:37.200 --> 01:18:40.800]  they know you're out there they'll hold them and until you're gone
[01:18:40.800 --> 01:18:44.720]  and then you catch the buses getting out and you give us the footage
[01:18:44.720 --> 01:18:49.120]  i'm sending reporters down there but they can't catch it every time
[01:18:49.120 --> 01:18:53.440]  because they stop shipping when they see that we're there
[01:18:53.440 --> 01:18:56.800]  and then we'll have the footage
[01:18:56.800 --> 01:19:03.440]  of the entire circle being completed of rick perry helping obama
[01:19:03.440 --> 01:19:08.720]  ship the illegals in and those two met and i'm sure it's a plan
[01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:13.200]  just us talking about this may make rick perry do the right thing
[01:19:13.200 --> 01:19:18.000]  let me tell you something rick perry is a gigantic snake ladies and gentlemen
[01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:23.520]  he's a former democrat flip republican
[01:19:23.520 --> 01:19:27.360]  he used to support gun control when he was a democrat
[01:19:27.360 --> 01:19:30.880]  anyone that ever supports gun control is a piece of trash

[01:22:05.280 --> 01:22:08.880]  patriot supply several years ago matt was sitting in his two bedroom
[01:22:08.880 --> 01:22:11.680]  apartment frustrated with the direction this country was headed
[01:22:11.680 --> 01:22:14.640]  and the charlottes willing to sell us out for a quick buck

[01:24:45.040 --> 01:24:48.000]  they wanted to deny the border was open months ago when they'd ordered the
[01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:51.680]  stand down four months ago they wanted to deny that they were
[01:24:51.680 --> 01:24:55.520]  basically ending deportations and releasing people for three to five
[01:24:55.520 --> 01:25:00.320]  years and giving them a driver's license it's all out in the open now
[01:25:00.320 --> 01:25:06.480]  and if we can make Rick Perry come out and tell the truth about what's going
[01:25:06.480 --> 01:25:11.760]  on in texas it's game over if we had one leader
[01:25:11.760 --> 01:25:15.680]  Rand Paul and Ted Cruz are talking about how it's deliberate
[01:25:15.680 --> 01:25:19.840]  and that's why their stars are rising
[01:25:20.480 --> 01:25:26.640]  they're for real. Rick Perry knows exactly what's going on on the border
[01:25:26.640 --> 01:25:30.960]  and he knows obama isn't paying lip service obama is engaged in deliberate
[01:25:30.960 --> 01:25:33.680]  remember Perry said he wouldn't meet with obama when he came
[01:25:33.680 --> 01:25:37.360]  and wouldn't shake his hand he did both that's the thing about Perry
[01:25:37.360 --> 01:25:42.000]  he always does the opposite of what he says i've been under him for over 10
[01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:45.600]  years i know all about him he's been on the show
[01:25:45.600 --> 01:25:49.840]  calling me a big fat pig you gotta find that clip
[01:25:49.840 --> 01:25:52.960]  one time he walks up he goes is that alex jones you're on the air with
[01:25:52.960 --> 01:25:56.080]  down at the Capitol we had a reporter grabs away he goes you big old fat
[01:25:56.080 --> 01:26:01.760]  sweaty hog i mean Perry does not like me folks
[01:26:02.400 --> 01:26:08.000]  and i want to believe in Rick Perry i don't want to just sit here and say he's
[01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:12.000]  a horrible person and the state police have been down there
[01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:17.200]  stopping the hardened criminals and trying to shame ice into deporting them
[01:26:17.200 --> 01:26:20.800]  so i mean maybe Perry's doing some good but i don't
[01:26:20.800 --> 01:26:23.520]  trust him i'm sorry i said i go to your calls
[01:26:23.520 --> 01:26:27.200]  eric and ohio on rick Perry what do you think he's doing say he's gonna send a
[01:26:27.200 --> 01:26:31.040]  thousand guard down there well as a former member of the
[01:26:31.040 --> 01:26:33.920]  ohio national guard i thought it was i thought it was going to be a great thing
[01:26:33.920 --> 01:26:37.600]  i don't know a whole lot about the governor of texas
[01:26:37.600 --> 01:26:40.800]  and now after listening to you talk about him i don't know if it was a great thing
[01:26:40.800 --> 01:26:43.440]  or not i mean well you notice i mean before i even
[01:26:43.440 --> 01:26:46.800]  read the article this morning in cbs news i knew what it was going to say
[01:26:46.800 --> 01:26:50.480]  they're just there to be eyes and ears for the state police not actually grab
[01:26:50.480 --> 01:26:53.280]  anybody and they're there of the mexican cartel
[01:26:53.280 --> 01:26:56.960]  shooting people i guess they have more targets that they're not going to grab
[01:26:56.960 --> 01:27:01.440]  the illegals and deport them if Perry needs Perry needs to create a state
[01:27:01.440 --> 01:27:04.400]  facility and throw them in there to force a crisis
[01:27:04.400 --> 01:27:09.840]  show that show that the feds can't deploy the illegals into the country
[01:27:09.840 --> 01:27:13.120]  well see i thought maybe hopefully with him sending those trips down maybe they
[01:27:13.120 --> 01:27:17.520]  started training that southwest corner of the united states and the rest of the
[01:27:17.520 --> 01:27:20.240]  states wouldn't you know gather their national guard and
[01:27:20.240 --> 01:27:24.800]  go down on the border and start helping too so no no i agree and see it sounds
[01:27:24.800 --> 01:27:28.000]  like they're doing something but rick Perry's put the national guard on the
[01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:31.520]  border before and they don't do anything
[01:27:31.520 --> 01:27:34.640]  listen it's like saying hire more border patrol
[01:27:34.640 --> 01:27:37.280]  70% it came out last week the border patrol now
[01:27:37.280 --> 01:27:40.720]  are running the aiding and abetting and giving papers to
[01:27:40.720 --> 01:27:44.320]  and releasing the illegals so now the border patrol
[01:27:44.320 --> 01:27:48.000]  is an illegal alien importation agency remember the
[01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:52.400]  senior border patrol agent on fox news last week said our job is now to complete
[01:27:52.400 --> 01:27:58.480]  the smuggling cycle remember that yes so what i'm saying is this is a thousand
[01:27:58.480 --> 01:28:04.160]  troops to literally help conveyor belt the illegals in
[01:28:04.160 --> 01:28:08.560]  because who does the national guard couple up to
[01:28:09.040 --> 01:28:12.720]  the state yes but they're going to be coupling up to ice
[01:28:12.720 --> 01:28:16.000]  who are they going to give the people to
[01:28:17.360 --> 01:28:21.680]  the border patrol and then what does the border patrol do
[01:28:21.680 --> 01:28:27.360]  turn over over the federal government and what does the federal government do
[01:28:27.360 --> 01:28:30.640]  give a green card so the national guard
[01:28:30.640 --> 01:28:36.400]  will literally be like baggage handlers for the illegals
[01:28:37.120 --> 01:28:40.480]  and see that's the thing about it is i thought it was such a great thing and
[01:28:40.480 --> 01:28:44.800]  i believe 100% what you're saying and that's that puts me to shame and
[01:28:44.800 --> 01:28:47.920]  being a no no no don't be put to shame sir i study this
[01:28:47.920 --> 01:28:52.880]  18 hours a day but but see how simple it is once you see it
[01:28:52.880 --> 01:28:56.160]  and if we just get that across look the border patrol is all saying what i'm
[01:28:56.160 --> 01:29:00.080]  saying the head of the union the deputy head
[01:29:00.080 --> 01:29:04.720]  senior agents are on tv saying when i'm no one's listening to them
[01:29:04.720 --> 01:29:09.040]  rick perry's going obama isn't doing a very good job on security
[01:29:09.040 --> 01:29:13.200]  it'd be like if somebody lowered the drawbridge to the enemy to the castle
[01:29:13.200 --> 01:29:16.880]  and then the enemy overruns the castle and you say gee that guy that opened the
[01:29:16.880 --> 01:29:20.720]  drawbridge at 3 a.m he didn't do a very good job no no
[01:29:20.720 --> 01:29:24.400]  he was working for the other side he did a great job
[01:29:24.400 --> 01:29:32.240]  you see what i'm saying yes sir so i don't think rick perry is that stupid
[01:29:32.240 --> 01:29:35.360]  in fact i know he's not a god bless you i appreciate your call sir don't feel
[01:29:35.360 --> 01:29:38.720]  bad that no i got up saw it went oh good something's

[01:29:41.360 --> 01:29:44.960]  read the article he's gonna say they're not gonna be doing anything
[01:29:44.960 --> 01:29:49.040]  and sure enough that's what's going on it is unbelievable
[01:29:49.040 --> 01:29:52.400]  we're on the back more calls the empires all lots and i'm gonna race through your

[01:35:27.200 --> 01:35:31.120]  terrorist and drug dealers that's what the establishment's putting out now
[01:35:31.120 --> 01:35:35.280]  as isis declares that they're going to use it
[01:35:35.280 --> 01:35:39.360]  but notice the west is actually funding isis and of course they're told to do
[01:35:39.360 --> 01:35:43.200]  that just to demonize it i mean it's totally cia run on record
[01:35:43.200 --> 01:35:47.440]  a big article how matt drudge changed the world with a video report
[01:35:47.440 --> 01:35:50.560]  and again even if you don't like matt drudge most people do
[01:35:50.560 --> 01:35:54.160]  he has the most diverse website of liberal conservative libertarian foreign
[01:35:54.160 --> 01:35:57.360]  news local news videos shot on the street
[01:35:57.360 --> 01:36:03.680]  he's been doing that since 1995 he had a big email list and stuff before that
[01:36:03.680 --> 01:36:07.520]  back in the 92 93 94
[01:36:08.000 --> 01:36:11.040]  but that's why we did this video report that's going viral
[01:36:11.040 --> 01:36:14.720]  is to celebrate that you are the media
[01:36:14.720 --> 01:36:17.920]  i mean matt drudge is out there fighting to keep the media free and open
[01:36:17.920 --> 01:36:21.440]  fighting to keep the internet free and open fighting to defend journalists
[01:36:21.440 --> 01:36:26.000]  that are being persecuted regardless of their political views
[01:36:26.000 --> 01:36:31.200]  and then i see a bunch of leftists on info wars dot com they're a minority but
[01:36:31.200 --> 01:36:33.520]  they're about a 20 percent of the comments
[01:36:33.520 --> 01:36:37.760]  basically calling for matt drudge to be shut down you people are not liberals
[01:36:37.760 --> 01:36:42.960]  folks you are part of a totalitarian gang
[01:36:42.960 --> 01:36:46.400]  that want to silence your opposition look at how the irs has been used on pro
[01:36:46.400 --> 01:36:52.480]  life tea party grips you name it to bully everyone
[01:36:52.480 --> 01:36:56.400]  shame on you and if the republicans were acting like this i'd say shame on
[01:36:56.400 --> 01:37:00.480]  them where is your instinct to be free
[01:37:00.480 --> 01:37:04.240]  where is your instinct to to not butcher the society
[01:37:04.240 --> 01:37:07.200]  i mean people are getting the five thousand dollar fines now from obama
[01:37:07.200 --> 01:37:09.920]  care people are getting kicked off by the millions
[01:37:09.920 --> 01:37:13.840]  people are finding out it's doubling your prices
[01:37:13.840 --> 01:37:18.160]  admit we were right about it being a giant screw job
[01:37:19.200 --> 01:37:23.040]  and as long as the globalists can run the country and manage crises
[01:37:23.040 --> 01:37:27.680]  they're going to keep creating crises to get what they want
[01:37:27.680 --> 01:37:30.400]  like the imploded border let's move quick through calls now
[01:37:30.400 --> 01:37:34.320]  daniel in colorado you're on the air go ahead
[01:37:34.320 --> 01:37:38.160]  absolutely alex uh i just wanted to touch base uh on a
[01:37:38.160 --> 01:37:42.000]  rick perry absolutely and uh just how he uh
[01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:44.960]  how he's just too faced is all hell man i mean
[01:37:44.960 --> 01:37:48.320]  you were just posting the article a couple weeks ago about him
[01:37:48.320 --> 01:37:52.480]  talking about not even shaking obama's hand or acknowledging him and
[01:37:52.480 --> 01:37:55.680]  you know here you got him cooperating with him so
[01:37:55.680 --> 01:37:58.800]  it's just like i'm so done with all these senators
[01:37:58.800 --> 01:38:03.440]  uh pointing fingers at him but you know that i mean holding his hand when the
[01:38:03.440 --> 01:38:06.560]  doors are closed it's like if you are
[01:38:06.560 --> 01:38:10.320]  if you're you're part of the problem if if you're not helping
[01:38:10.320 --> 01:38:14.240]  and you're you're not helping towards exactly the federal government's been
[01:38:14.240 --> 01:38:18.080]  hijacked it's ordered the drawbridge lowered
[01:38:18.080 --> 01:38:23.120]  already the the more people poured into the castle that can live in it
[01:38:23.120 --> 01:38:27.280]  the lifeboat's sinking and we can't even get a debate going
[01:38:27.280 --> 01:38:31.760]  about this this being premeditated when scores of border patrol agents are
[01:38:31.760 --> 01:38:35.600]  being fired or being gag ordered for going on
[01:38:35.600 --> 01:38:40.240]  television in this show and saying no we were ordered to stand down four
[01:38:40.240 --> 01:38:43.840]  months ago and the border patrol said go to this
[01:38:43.840 --> 01:38:48.560]  place you will see the bus brought in we give them vouchers and we broke it
[01:38:48.560 --> 01:38:53.680]  info wars i don't deserve credit i don't want credit
[01:38:53.680 --> 01:38:57.520]  the media knows folks they know what's going on
[01:38:57.520 --> 01:39:01.840]  little info wars and by little we've got like seven or eight reporters
[01:39:01.840 --> 01:39:05.920]  counting news reporters camera people and writers
[01:39:05.920 --> 01:39:09.440]  we have a tiny operation compared to even you know the austin american
[01:39:09.440 --> 01:39:12.000]  statesman has like 800 employees or something and
[01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:17.520]  hundreds of writers and a huge budget
[01:39:17.680 --> 01:39:23.120]  they are doing it on purpose they're not telling you what's going on go ahead
[01:39:23.120 --> 01:39:27.680]  absolutely another thing is uh that whole white flag thing is uh that's i mean
[01:39:27.680 --> 01:39:32.720]  that's got obama administration written all over it i mean just like the hollywood
[01:39:32.720 --> 01:39:36.160]  subliminal messages of the new world order i mean they're just teaching you
[01:39:36.160 --> 01:39:39.760]  to accept it they're saying hey forget about your second amendment
[01:39:39.760 --> 01:39:43.600]  forget about your ammunition lay down and uh you won't die
[01:39:43.600 --> 01:39:47.600]  i mean they're throwing that white flag up in our own country
[01:39:47.600 --> 01:39:51.840]  i mean it's i i think it's it's deteriorating so fast
[01:39:51.840 --> 01:39:58.720]  that before the elections come in 2016 uh hell will be untapped already i mean
[01:39:58.720 --> 01:40:03.760]  on american soil i agree with you i mean i i i didn't
[01:40:03.760 --> 01:40:06.640]  think obama would try to stay in office i thought he would try to put in a
[01:40:06.640 --> 01:40:10.000]  permanent dictatorship of the bureaucracy but it looks like he could go
[01:40:10.000 --> 01:40:13.440]  for a permanent dictatorship with everything we're seeing being deployed
[01:40:13.440 --> 01:40:16.880]  all the preparations and my gut told me it's somebody who's
[01:40:16.880 --> 01:40:21.360]  gonna let it get a bunch of attention let it peak with why is there a white
[01:40:21.360 --> 01:40:23.920]  flag and they're gonna claim either we've given
[01:40:23.920 --> 01:40:26.560]  into al-qaeda and isis we shouldn't be working with them
[01:40:26.560 --> 01:40:29.760]  or we've given in with our borders being open or both
[01:40:29.760 --> 01:40:35.120]  i think it will be i think it will be that but you but you're right
[01:40:35.120 --> 01:40:39.920]  they're so in our face now that this could be some shine
[01:40:39.920 --> 01:40:43.040]  where they they allowed nukes to be brought into manhattan like obama said
[01:40:43.040 --> 01:40:47.600]  a few months ago that's his biggest fear and that this was a message
[01:40:47.600 --> 01:40:51.280]  to saudi arabia or somebody that you know that hey
[01:40:51.280 --> 01:40:55.440]  you either post the big white flags it looks like it was professionally done
[01:40:55.440 --> 01:40:57.600]  that you know that's the sign that you're going to give in and do what we
[01:40:57.600 --> 01:41:00.720]  want and we're going to set the nukes off i don't know it
[01:41:00.720 --> 01:41:05.360]  this is like a movie folks you're living in a movie i appreciate your call
[01:41:05.360 --> 01:41:07.920]  fred in new york what do you think the white flags are what do you think of
[01:41:07.920 --> 01:41:12.160]  rick barry hey alex uh well i think it's just the front
[01:41:12.160 --> 01:41:15.600]  uh what they're doing this is nothing is going to happen
[01:41:15.600 --> 01:41:18.640]  you know like you were saying they just going to put people right there just
[01:41:18.640 --> 01:41:21.920]  to look around and you know they're going to be like big flies they choose
[01:41:21.920 --> 01:41:24.160]  going to go around them they're going to look at them
[01:41:24.160 --> 01:41:28.560]  you know hand it to the border patrol in that's it that's all it is uh more
[01:41:28.560 --> 01:41:32.640]  taxpayer money being wasted and nothing they're not going to do anything about it
[01:41:32.640 --> 01:41:36.080]  nothing nothing oh i agree they're just going to let the
[01:41:36.080 --> 01:41:40.560]  border get worse and worse until every city in town has at least a 50 000 100
[01:41:40.560 --> 01:41:44.320]  000 illegals in it and then it'll all be about how
[01:41:44.320 --> 01:41:47.680]  we've got to take care of them or we're racist and we've got to turn our guns
[01:41:47.680 --> 01:41:52.400]  in or we're racist or we've got to uh support obama care we're
[01:41:52.400 --> 01:41:55.840]  racist remember you're racist if you say there's death panels
[01:41:55.840 --> 01:42:01.040]  they're calling it a glitch at the va it's in the documents that it's a death
[01:42:01.040 --> 01:42:03.360]  list and they decide to not give care
[01:42:03.360 --> 01:42:07.360]  oh you got a brain tumor that's 95 percent operable if it's gotten out in two
[01:42:07.360 --> 01:42:11.200]  months we're not going to give you surgery for a year
[01:42:11.200 --> 01:42:15.120]  that's the model in europe you're 75 year old veteran
[01:42:15.120 --> 01:42:18.320]  you're a 50 year old veteran they're done with you
[01:42:18.320 --> 01:42:22.160]  go home and die and you know what america likes it
[01:42:22.160 --> 01:42:29.520]  america's going to take it because we have run up the collective white flag
[01:42:29.520 --> 01:42:33.680]  we are a joke go ahead i know the thing that you
[01:42:33.680 --> 01:42:37.040]  are not mentioning too much that i think is very important
[01:42:37.040 --> 01:42:41.760]  is like you guys are talking about people coming from mexico a lot in central america
[01:42:41.760 --> 01:42:45.600]  uh people do not realize that people in south america especially
[01:42:45.600 --> 01:42:51.440]  ecuador karun colombia the amount of muslims and people from india
[01:42:51.440 --> 01:42:55.200]  they make a close south america they stay over there
[01:42:55.200 --> 01:42:59.440]  and they start moving up country to country and they pay thousands of dollars
[01:42:59.440 --> 01:43:04.480]  to get here and uh i wouldn't be surprised if
[01:43:04.480 --> 01:43:08.560]  al-qaeda is all the way down in south america well they admit they are
[01:43:08.560 --> 01:43:12.320]  oh they've caught them they're they're catching
[01:43:12.320 --> 01:43:18.240]  all sorts of isis al-qaeda people from jordan and saudi arabia and
[01:43:18.240 --> 01:43:24.960]  from egypt and from pakistan and that's happening it's in the local news
[01:43:24.960 --> 01:43:28.320]  again they're going to search you at the airport and check baby diapers
[01:43:28.320 --> 01:43:32.720]  but the border is wide open great points it's all a hoax
[01:43:32.720 --> 01:43:37.440]  homeland security is the takeover army to end america
[01:43:37.440 --> 01:43:41.520]  to end the states when the country goes completely bankrupt by design
[01:43:41.520 --> 01:43:47.600]  it's clowered and piven it's agenda 21 it's the wrecking of the country on
[01:43:47.600 --> 01:43:50.960]  purpose and i'm going to tell the police something and the bureaucrats and all of
[01:43:50.960 --> 01:43:54.960]  you you're not going to get your pension funds and the dollar is going to be
[01:43:54.960 --> 01:43:57.600]  devalued but it's the only job you've got you're
[01:43:57.600 --> 01:44:00.160]  going to go along with it you're going to salute when you're
[01:44:00.160 --> 01:44:02.800]  told to you're going to do whatever you're told
[01:44:02.800 --> 01:44:05.760]  you're going to have a civil war with the american people you're going to be
[01:44:05.760 --> 01:44:09.520]  slaughtered and you will follow the orders because you don't have the moral
[01:44:09.520 --> 01:44:13.280]  courage to say no now now that's a possible future
[01:44:13.280 --> 01:44:16.960]  i'm not saying that's who you are i'm saying that's what the elite think you
[01:44:16.960 --> 01:44:19.120]  are
[01:44:20.400 --> 01:44:24.000]  by frankly it's the border patrol and the military
[01:44:24.000 --> 01:44:26.880]  and the police are the ones that are saying the borders wide open and these
[01:44:26.880 --> 01:44:31.280]  are criminals and we're in a crisis and they're getting in trouble and getting
[01:44:31.280 --> 01:44:35.280]  fired over so as usual the american people
[01:44:35.280 --> 01:44:38.080]  have no idea what's going on on average
[01:44:38.080 --> 01:44:41.760]  even the average republican has no idea i mean they tune into these republican
[01:44:41.760 --> 01:44:44.560]  talk shows where they're like oh bomb was dumb
[01:44:44.560 --> 01:44:48.000]  he he he doesn't know what's going on at the border
[01:44:48.000 --> 01:44:51.280]  while kata could get in and get us he doesn't know
[01:44:51.280 --> 01:44:54.960]  they set the deal up a year ago with guatemala in mexico that's come out in
[01:44:54.960 --> 01:45:00.000]  the news it's all on purpose i'm trying not to get
[01:45:00.000 --> 01:45:04.240]  angry because it exhausts me
[01:45:05.440 --> 01:45:08.720]  let's go to paul joseph watson then we'll go to tim
[01:45:08.720 --> 01:45:12.080]  chris steve jason and many others that are
[01:45:12.080 --> 01:45:16.160]  patiently holding paul watson i want to get into
[01:45:16.160 --> 01:45:19.600]  tf sensors mh 17 air traffic control recordings
[01:45:19.600 --> 01:45:22.880]  security services confiscate tapes immediately after incident the russians
[01:45:22.880 --> 01:45:26.800]  have now released everything on their end videos of the rebels being shocked
[01:45:26.800 --> 01:45:31.120]  that that it was a commercial plane uh what does your gut tell you now a week
[01:45:31.120 --> 01:45:35.360]  into this or not quite a week six days into this really happened
[01:45:35.360 --> 01:45:38.240]  i don't know what really happened elix because there's been no proper
[01:45:38.240 --> 01:45:42.240]  investigation but that hasn't stopped kiev and washington
[01:45:42.240 --> 01:45:48.080]  from basically basing their entire case on youtube videos and facebook posts
[01:45:48.080 --> 01:45:51.360]  there's an amazing exchange which is going to go up on info wars shortly
[01:45:51.360 --> 01:45:54.000]  after get off air i've just done the article between
[01:45:54.000 --> 01:45:57.280]  us state department deputy spokesperson marie half
[01:45:57.280 --> 01:46:03.200]  and ap reporter matt lee and credit to him because he actually does his job
[01:46:03.200 --> 01:46:07.040]  and challenges authority challenges the official narrative and he basically
[01:46:07.040 --> 01:46:10.960]  says look the russians have just provided radar satellite
[01:46:10.960 --> 01:46:14.560]  imagery showing that there were these ukrainian fighter jets following the
[01:46:14.560 --> 01:46:18.720]  plane shortly before it was shot down what have you presented in terms of
[01:46:18.720 --> 01:46:21.600]  quote forensic evidence and it's amazing because he
[01:46:21.600 --> 01:46:24.880]  basically backs her into a corner and she's forced to admit that their
[01:46:24.880 --> 01:46:29.520]  entire case rests on dubious youtube videos
[01:46:29.520 --> 01:46:33.440]  and facebook posts that have since been proven fraudulent
[01:46:33.440 --> 01:46:37.360]  so it's it's a seven-minute clip maybe we'll get a chance to play it later on
[01:46:37.360 --> 01:46:41.520]  but again it just shows you know any questioning of the official narrative
[01:46:41.520 --> 01:46:45.520]  is derided as a quote russian propaganda you know we were called
[01:46:45.520 --> 01:46:49.120]  asad propagandists last august when we said that the
[01:46:49.120 --> 01:46:52.320]  gupta chemical weapons attack couldn't have been launched by
[01:46:52.320 --> 01:46:56.640]  government forces turns out mit report which came out later
[01:46:56.640 --> 01:47:01.600]  again not the kremlin not russia today mit said that that attack was
[01:47:01.600 --> 01:47:05.440]  impossible to have been launched from government forces in syria so
[01:47:05.440 --> 01:47:08.800]  were we asad propagandists for pointing out the truth that was later
[01:47:08.800 --> 01:47:11.680]  verified in triplicate again are we going to be
[01:47:11.680 --> 01:47:14.720]  put in kremlin propagandists for pointing out the fact that
[01:47:14.720 --> 01:47:19.840]  their entire case is based on youtube videos and social media posts and they've
[01:47:19.840 --> 01:47:23.920]  just admitted it in a press conference
[01:47:23.920 --> 01:47:26.560]  we're going to play that clip at the bottom the next hour after our guest
[01:47:26.560 --> 01:47:30.640]  leaves us paul but i tell you what is your overall
[01:47:30.640 --> 01:47:34.720]  worldview right now on the dollar devaluation on all the wars being
[01:47:34.720 --> 01:47:38.160]  started on the border being collapsed
[01:47:38.160 --> 01:47:41.520]  clearly this is an orchestrated event where do you think it's going and how is
[01:47:41.520 --> 01:47:45.600]  it going for the establishment well obviously they tried to seize on it
[01:47:45.600 --> 01:47:50.320]  immediately to control the narrative in context it occurred
[01:47:50.320 --> 01:47:53.680]  a day after the bricks countries came out and announced their
[01:47:53.680 --> 01:47:57.040]  anti-dollar anti-imf system i don't think there was any
[01:47:57.040 --> 01:48:00.080]  coincidence there you've got ukrainian forces losing
[01:48:00.080 --> 01:48:03.760]  battles in in key areas of the country so the timing was very
[01:48:03.760 --> 01:48:08.000]  coincidental and then you've got the the question of air traffic control
[01:48:08.000 --> 01:48:11.680]  tapes now in the case of the original malaysian airliner
[01:48:11.680 --> 01:48:15.440]  that disappeared back in march they released transcripts of the air traffic
[01:48:15.440 --> 01:48:20.000]  control tapes within three days of the incident here we are nearly a week
[01:48:20.000 --> 01:48:23.920]  later we've got nothing whatsoever no transcripts from air traffic control
[01:48:23.920 --> 01:48:27.840]  and why is that well it's because ukrainian security forces
[01:48:27.840 --> 01:48:31.200]  the very first thing they did after the plane crash
[01:48:31.200 --> 01:48:35.680]  was seize the air traffic control tapes and we've heard nothing more of them
[01:48:35.680 --> 01:48:39.680]  since so we've had this whole media propaganda firestorm about the rebels
[01:48:39.680 --> 01:48:42.320]  are preventing people from investigating when they've let all the
[01:48:42.320 --> 01:48:45.840]  international investigators in you know the rebels are preventing us from getting
[01:48:45.840 --> 01:48:48.320]  the black boxes they've handed the black boxes over
[01:48:48.320 --> 01:48:53.120]  and it's actually Kiev ukraine that are concealing the evidence of the air
[01:48:53.120 --> 01:48:55.600]  traffic control tapes which will tell us
[01:48:55.600 --> 01:48:59.360]  if that airliner was being followed by ukrainian
[01:48:59.360 --> 01:49:02.320]  jet fighters but it seems they're very reticent
[01:49:02.320 --> 01:49:06.240]  to be transparent and release that information maybe because it disagrees
[01:49:06.240 --> 01:49:09.280]  with the official narrative and the russians have now released
[01:49:09.280 --> 01:49:15.200]  their radar files computer files showing that there were jets shadowing
[01:49:15.200 --> 01:49:18.880]  the malaysian aircraft yeah actual evidence not
[01:49:18.880 --> 01:49:23.200]  facebook posts that turn out to be fake i mean this state department spoke
[01:49:23.200 --> 01:49:26.720]  some sight of this facebook post by Igor Strelkov one of these
[01:49:26.720 --> 01:49:30.480]  ukrainian rebel commanders saying that he was bragging about
[01:49:30.480 --> 01:49:33.040]  accepting responsibility for taking down the plane
[01:49:33.040 --> 01:49:36.240]  turns out this facebook page the russian equivalent
[01:49:36.240 --> 01:49:42.160]  was a fake made by fans according to rebels who spoke to buzzfeed max sedan
[01:49:42.160 --> 01:49:45.040]  so the words can't even be attributed to the rebel commander
[01:49:45.040 --> 01:49:49.360]  and the post makes reference to the shootdown of a military transport plane
[01:49:49.360 --> 01:49:52.640]  not a civilian airliner so that's one of the key
[01:49:52.640 --> 01:49:56.320]  pieces of evidence that the u.s government is resting their narrative on
[01:49:56.320 --> 01:50:00.320]  a fake facebook post that's since been completely debunked
[01:50:00.320 --> 01:50:04.640]  and it's not like we're just questioning the u.s government for the first time
[01:50:04.640 --> 01:50:08.400]  all they do is lie when the truth would serve them better
[01:50:08.400 --> 01:50:14.640]  and they overthrew ukraine they started all this their funding isis
[01:50:14.640 --> 01:50:19.600]  it's not our government and it's on russia's doorstep and russia is not
[01:50:19.600 --> 01:50:22.960]  expanding and russia is leaving everyone alone
[01:50:22.960 --> 01:50:28.640]  i mean it's it's completely immoral our government is run by evil people and the
[01:50:28.640 --> 01:50:34.240]  whole world is seeing it paul and america's losing the moral high ground
[01:50:34.240 --> 01:50:38.400]  and it's giving evil communist chinese the moral high ground

[01:54:17.760 --> 01:54:22.720]  incomplete in my view without clonal silver we have it in nano-sized
[01:54:22.720 --> 01:54:26.400]  particles the strongest out there we found the best laboratory
[01:54:26.400 --> 01:54:30.640]  the strongest we could get we've inspected it uh it is
[01:54:30.640 --> 01:54:35.120]  extremely powerful and i've personally used it with a chest cold that killed
[01:54:35.120 --> 01:54:39.440]  two members of my family and that i couldn't kick with antibiotics
[01:54:39.440 --> 01:54:43.040]  that killed tens of thousands across the country this winter
[01:54:43.040 --> 01:54:47.040]  and and i believe it was the clonal silver that finally defeated it
[01:54:47.040 --> 01:54:50.240]  the antibiotics didn't do anything
[01:54:51.040 --> 01:54:53.840]  it's sold out

[01:56:44.800 --> 01:56:48.160]  health dot com let's go back to paul watson in this
[01:56:48.160 --> 01:56:52.080]  segment and then we're going to go to calls and then go to our guest
[01:56:52.080 --> 01:56:55.840]  but paul watson other points on just the big picture
[01:56:55.840 --> 01:56:59.120]  because the globalists have the power and have the weapons and still have the
[01:56:59.120 --> 01:57:03.040]  dollar but pr wise they're failing on all fronts
[01:57:03.040 --> 01:57:07.760]  how do you see this ending um i don't i don't think there's going to be a
[01:57:07.760 --> 01:57:11.440]  massive imminent war i just think this is more of a regional
[01:57:11.440 --> 01:57:14.080]  pressure valve that they're trying to release because you got to remember that
[01:57:14.080 --> 01:57:18.400]  you know russia's economy is what 130th the size of the us
[01:57:18.400 --> 01:57:21.520]  their army is relatively weak in comparison so
[01:57:21.520 --> 01:57:24.800]  in a face-to-face war that's not going to work out well for russia so i don't
[01:57:24.800 --> 01:57:28.640]  think it's going into into that kind of apocalyptic scenario
[01:57:28.640 --> 01:57:33.280]  but again it definitely shows just the hubris and the arrogance of washington
[01:57:33.280 --> 01:57:37.280]  in thinking that their credit credibility rests on their name alone when
[01:57:37.280 --> 01:57:40.560]  they've been caught lying innumerable times in the past
[01:57:40.560 --> 01:57:45.520]  again last year we almost went to war based on a complete fabrication which
[01:57:45.520 --> 01:57:49.040]  was again centered around youtube videos
[01:57:49.040 --> 01:57:52.400]  so washington's standard for forensic evidence
[01:57:52.400 --> 01:57:56.560]  in situations that could very easily lead to war and conflict
[01:57:56.560 --> 01:58:02.480]  is now probably less solid than an internet conspiracy theorist so that
[01:58:02.480 --> 01:58:05.280]  very pejorative term that they use against us
[01:58:05.280 --> 01:58:09.280]  their evidence is even below that standard is beyond that paul
[01:58:09.280 --> 01:58:13.040]  they say for two years if you use chemical weapons of sod that's the red
[01:58:13.040 --> 01:58:16.640]  line and then they have the saudi arabians launch a chemical attack
[01:58:16.640 --> 01:58:20.480]  they get caught in triplicate even the u n says it's them
[01:58:20.480 --> 01:58:23.680]  and nobody gets in trouble syhersh came out and said the chemical attack was a
[01:58:23.680 --> 01:58:27.200]  false flag that's two-time Pulitzer prize winner
[01:58:27.200 --> 01:58:30.480]  i mean they just of course they do false flags all the time
[01:58:30.480 --> 01:58:33.520]  there's like a child molester gets released from prison and a kid gets
[01:58:33.520 --> 01:58:37.120]  molested by somebody that matches the id the cops are going to go to the child
[01:58:37.120 --> 01:58:39.920]  molester's house our government's like a bunch of child molesters
[01:58:39.920 --> 01:58:45.440]  i mean they are just the scum of the earth gcn the genesis those women at the
[01:58:45.440 --> 01:58:50.160]  state department i mean they look like psychopathic witches
[01:58:50.160 --> 01:58:55.600]  alex jones here for info wars dot com in the month of july we have got giant

[01:59:47.520 --> 01:59:50.560]  dead ants
[01:59:50.560 --> 02:00:06.000]  waging war on corruption alex jones on the gcm radio network
[02:00:06.000 --> 02:00:10.800]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups
[02:00:10.800 --> 02:00:18.160]  you want answers well so does he he's alex jones on the gcm radio network
[02:00:18.160 --> 02:00:28.640]  and now live from austin texas alex jones
[02:00:28.640 --> 02:00:31.840]  all right paul watson again we've got the mother of
[02:00:31.840 --> 02:00:35.840]  the shilt road captive political prisoner coming up for a couple
[02:00:35.840 --> 02:00:39.280]  segments and i promise i'll go to tim
[02:00:39.280 --> 02:00:44.160]  and everybody else jason steve mj chris we're gonna get to all of you
[02:00:44.160 --> 02:00:48.800]  going back to paul watson uh you had an article last week dealing with this silk road
[02:00:48.800 --> 02:00:52.320]  situation i think this is really important because
[02:00:52.320 --> 02:00:57.040]  if they start arresting people for what other folks do on a message board
[02:00:57.040 --> 02:01:01.200]  whether it's file sharing or talking about drugs or whatever
[02:01:01.200 --> 02:01:04.640]  or talking about violence i mean that sets the precedent like the old soviet
[02:01:04.640 --> 02:01:08.240]  union or nazi germany where if your neighbor does something wrong
[02:01:08.240 --> 02:01:12.880]  you go to jail and this is classic autocratic totalitarianism in my view
[02:01:12.880 --> 02:01:17.280]  headline feds hijack silk road case in bid to dismantle internet freedom
[02:01:17.280 --> 02:01:21.440]  tell us about what's coming up paul yeah this is again it's it's a chilling
[02:01:21.440 --> 02:01:23.920]  precedent they're trying to use this case to create
[02:01:23.920 --> 02:01:27.520]  bad law which is basically based around what they call
[02:01:27.520 --> 02:01:32.080]  transferred intent which as he said is a website owner for example being
[02:01:32.080 --> 02:01:36.480]  responsible for criminal behavior of one of the users so it could be a just a
[02:01:36.480 --> 02:01:40.160]  violent comment threatening somebody you would then be criminally responsible
[02:01:40.160 --> 02:01:44.400]  for that behavior it could also be isps becoming
[02:01:44.400 --> 02:01:48.080]  responsible for their users browsing habits
[02:01:48.080 --> 02:01:52.960]  so if somebody visits a child porn website then the isp becomes liable
[02:01:52.960 --> 02:01:56.320]  for that behavior and of course we've seen with the internet filters
[02:01:56.320 --> 02:02:00.000]  most of them have got nothing to do with child porn or whatever they block
[02:02:00.000 --> 02:02:04.000]  perfectly legitimate sites so this is basically the entree
[02:02:04.000 --> 02:02:07.440]  to massive internet censorship some people have said that it's
[02:02:07.440 --> 02:02:11.040]  it's just a real threat of soap and pipper which attracted huge
[02:02:11.040 --> 02:02:13.520]  demonstrations and we actually won those battles
[02:02:13.520 --> 02:02:18.480]  this has flown under the radar aside from the legalities of silk road
[02:02:18.480 --> 02:02:22.000]  itself the feds are trying to hijack this case
[02:02:22.000 --> 02:02:25.440]  to dismantle freedom on the internet and also push this
[02:02:25.440 --> 02:02:29.600]  trusted id system where everybody has to get a government permission basically
[02:02:29.600 --> 02:02:35.040]  to use the web so it's a massive case it is massive we'll talk to the man's
[02:02:35.040 --> 02:02:38.960]  mother via skype coming up in the next segment
[02:02:38.960 --> 02:02:43.520]  but expanding on that google you know says that they scan your attachments
[02:02:43.520 --> 02:02:47.040]  and copy them and so does microsoft and all these systems when you use their
[02:02:47.040 --> 02:02:50.480]  email to make sure you're not sending something illegal
[02:02:50.480 --> 02:02:53.440]  well that's like saying you're going to open all the mail to make sure there's
[02:02:53.440 --> 02:02:58.320]  not something illegal it's prior to a strain it's guilty until proven innocent
[02:02:58.320 --> 02:03:01.840]  and it's being done by groups with proven criminal intent
[02:03:01.840 --> 02:03:06.720]  to dominate and control markets and to steal intellectual property
[02:03:06.720 --> 02:03:09.040]  i mean if you try to walk into government buildings without a warrant
[02:03:09.040 --> 02:03:11.680]  and search all their stuff they'd get in your face
[02:03:11.680 --> 02:03:15.520]  this again is an inversion of the the basic
[02:03:15.520 --> 02:03:20.640]  things that of this country was founded on well exactly and i mean
[02:03:20.640 --> 02:03:23.920]  you know they're watching us more than ever yet they're becoming less and less
[02:03:23.920 --> 02:03:26.160]  transparent that's the whole nature of government
[02:03:26.160 --> 02:03:29.920]  we're expected to be more open we're expected to have our email read our phone
[02:03:29.920 --> 02:03:32.560]  calls listen to and just be happy with it because
[02:03:32.560 --> 02:03:36.160]  you know terrorists or whatever reason and yet government's becoming more and
[02:03:36.160 --> 02:03:39.600]  more secretive as it becomes more corrupt which is a direct
[02:03:39.600 --> 02:03:42.880]  relationship that we know takes place so again this
[02:03:42.880 --> 02:03:45.920]  this case is massive and it's it's a shame that it's not got a lot of
[02:03:45.920 --> 02:03:49.040]  attention but i think the interview that you've got coming up will really bring
[02:03:49.040 --> 02:03:52.560]  some fresh light to it and make people understand that if
[02:03:52.560 --> 02:03:56.880]  ross olbrich loses this case they're going to then use this law to come
[02:03:56.880 --> 02:04:00.720]  after website operators and owners who's users commit
[02:04:00.720 --> 02:04:03.600]  so-called criminal behavior and they're going to be responsible for it so it's
[02:04:03.600 --> 02:04:07.040]  going to have a massive chilling effect we need to see
[02:04:07.040 --> 02:04:11.600]  the dinosaur press the new media all come together
[02:04:11.600 --> 02:04:14.080]  i don't expect the whole dinosaur press to do but there are some people of
[02:04:14.080 --> 02:04:17.280]  conscience left there like that ap reporter you were talking about
[02:04:17.280 --> 02:04:20.880]  questioning the whole fake ukraine shootdown narrative
[02:04:20.880 --> 02:04:23.840]  we need to all come together and say look we need to agree on freedom of
[02:04:23.840 --> 02:04:27.680]  speech because they only want to take that away to then take the bank
[02:04:27.680 --> 02:04:30.960]  accounts the financial freedom the travel freedom this is all part of a
[02:04:30.960 --> 02:04:34.880]  total package and that's why i want to see an article to mara paul
[02:04:34.880 --> 02:04:38.400]  really looking at what matt drudge has done for everybody's free speech
[02:04:38.400 --> 02:04:42.800]  in the last 20 years because he's under attack constantly
[02:04:42.800 --> 02:04:46.640]  and i like this special report we put out the video but i just don't think it
[02:04:46.640 --> 02:04:51.200]  does justice uh you know the the little article
[02:04:51.200 --> 02:04:55.840]  took to to to how important it is to stand together
[02:04:55.840 --> 02:05:00.320]  so it was a great job paul we'll be back
[02:05:00.720 --> 02:05:04.800]  hi i'm dr edward group it took me 20 years

[02:08:42.320 --> 02:08:46.560]  the silk road you remember a lot of posts that were on there
[02:08:46.560 --> 02:08:51.040]  from john mackafee and things in debates about what he was talking about
[02:08:51.040 --> 02:08:56.160]  on that site well his mother joins us lin
[02:08:56.160 --> 02:09:01.040]  olbrich the mother of ross olbrich the man accused of creating and running the

[02:09:37.840 --> 02:09:41.920]  and to give her view on what's happening
[02:09:41.920 --> 02:09:45.520]  and she's learned of course it will set a massive precedent from the lawyers

[02:10:15.280 --> 02:10:21.600]  sopa syspa it will become a draconian tool of total control openly run by the
[02:10:21.600 --> 02:10:26.560]  nsa and the corporations that have divided up the spoils
[02:10:26.560 --> 02:10:31.040]  that said understand i've had the fbi here
[02:10:31.040 --> 02:10:34.320]  repeatedly i've had the secret service here
[02:10:34.320 --> 02:10:39.920]  repeatedly i've had the state police here i've had the atf here
[02:10:39.920 --> 02:10:43.600]  i've had them all here they come here and they say
[02:10:43.600 --> 02:10:49.600]  what is this on your message board do you know about this are you part of this
[02:10:49.600 --> 02:10:53.120]  and i look at them and i go you know i have a website visited
[02:10:53.120 --> 02:10:56.800]  i have millions of people a day and you're trying to act like i've done
[02:10:56.800 --> 02:11:02.560]  something wrong to convince me i have so that you can act like i'm supporting
[02:11:02.560 --> 02:11:06.480]  someone on here saying they want to kill a cop
[02:11:06.480 --> 02:11:12.640]  and if you have a subpoena for the ip address of that person that's fine
[02:11:12.640 --> 02:11:15.520]  i'm not going to fight that subpoena the person shouldn't be on their sand kill
[02:11:15.520 --> 02:11:19.040]  cops but don't try to connect me to it or claim
[02:11:19.040 --> 02:11:25.040]  that i am aiding and abetting this when we have moderators and we use a third
[02:11:25.040 --> 02:11:31.440]  party system how dare you that's why again they
[02:11:31.440 --> 02:11:37.040]  swat team amish all over the country they'll move fbi in or others next door
[02:11:37.040 --> 02:11:40.240]  for some cases a year and a half famous case for years ago
[02:11:40.240 --> 02:11:45.280]  we had the amish folks on and they kept begging please give us cheese and milk
[02:11:45.280 --> 02:11:47.600]  and the amish would just keep giving them cheese and milk
[02:11:47.600 --> 02:11:55.920]  and say i feel bad just take money oh no no no after a year of that they got them
[02:11:55.920 --> 02:12:00.320]  to start selling them cheese which they would then take across state lines and
[02:12:00.320 --> 02:12:04.000]  sell to farmers market and they swat team them shoved them down put guns in
[02:12:04.000 --> 02:12:07.840]  their head for the jury they tell you how the how the feds work
[02:12:07.840 --> 02:12:11.520]  the jury sees your swat team well these amish must be bad
[02:12:11.520 --> 02:12:15.200]  see how freakish that is and when the fbi comes in here
[02:12:15.200 --> 02:12:20.160]  they'll go and try to get me to feel bad like i did something because someone
[02:12:20.160 --> 02:12:24.960]  said something violent on the website and then there's a gag order in the
[02:12:24.960 --> 02:12:29.040]  subpoena and so then i can't talk about it i can just say the fbi was here
[02:12:29.040 --> 02:12:32.880]  people go oh you liar being a drama queen and then a year later some guy gets
[02:12:32.880 --> 02:12:35.120]  convicted in federal court of threatening to kill a cop
[02:12:35.120 --> 02:12:38.800]  and putting the guy's address out and it talks about me and the fbi visit
[02:12:38.800 --> 02:12:43.520]  i mean i'm not you know i have to deal with this folks
[02:12:43.680 --> 02:12:47.920]  and i actually just laugh now i mean that doesn't happen that many times over
[02:12:47.920 --> 02:12:52.560]  years maybe 10 times different agencies and then now they've got files or mo
[02:12:52.560 --> 02:12:55.600]  and don't even do that they just go here's the subpoena give us the stuff
[02:12:55.600 --> 02:12:59.440]  and i'm here on some coffee treat me normal i'll treat you normal
[02:12:59.440 --> 02:13:03.600]  don't come in here and go oh so you're going along with these people wanting
[02:13:03.600 --> 02:13:08.160]  to kill cops no i'm not well why'd you remove the post then
[02:13:08.160 --> 02:13:13.520]  we have moderators that do that we'll put the post back up
[02:13:13.520 --> 02:13:16.640]  oh you want to get me to give the order to put up killing the cops so you can
[02:13:16.640 --> 02:13:21.520]  imprison me you know i got cameras in here boys
[02:13:21.520 --> 02:13:26.560]  get out of my office give me the subpoena and get out of here
[02:13:27.040 --> 02:13:31.280]  i mean i don't know how these people sleep at night when they go out and set up
[02:13:31.280 --> 02:13:39.760]  innocent people all the time it's shameful shameful and disgusting
[02:13:39.760 --> 02:13:43.600]  atf there's and i'm gonna go to our guests they're the atf
[02:13:43.600 --> 02:13:46.320]  the atf
[02:13:46.880 --> 02:13:50.720]  we'll have gun range totes at big gun ranges there's famous cases of this
[02:13:50.720 --> 02:13:54.000]  you've heard about them we've covered them
[02:13:54.000 --> 02:13:59.280]  and a guy'll have an m4 semi-automatic 223
[02:14:00.080 --> 02:14:05.280]  rifle and sometimes they malfunction and shoot two rounds
[02:14:05.280 --> 02:14:09.200]  they'll put them in federal prison even admitting knowing it was an accident
[02:14:09.200 --> 02:14:12.640]  because the guy is a veteran with no criminal record
[02:14:12.640 --> 02:14:15.920]  that's who they want folks that's why you know the government is
[02:14:15.920 --> 02:14:21.200]  evil now that said they can use a case that on the surface
[02:14:21.200 --> 02:14:24.400]  you can say it's a little more questionable
[02:14:24.400 --> 02:14:28.560]  but if you but if he doesn't get out of this and they're able to get this
[02:14:28.560 --> 02:14:32.880]  it's going to set a precedent to put everybody in jail
[02:14:32.880 --> 02:14:36.880]  for what other people say or do on any platforms including telecoms
[02:14:36.880 --> 02:14:39.920]  this is the end of internet freedom as we know it
[02:14:39.920 --> 02:14:44.000]  and it's extremely draconing and i want to thank lin olbrich for holding again
[02:14:44.000 --> 02:14:48.800]  the mother of the creator of the silk road free ross.org
[02:14:48.800 --> 02:14:51.280]  and she joins us to talk about this important case
[02:14:51.280 --> 02:14:55.040]  paul watson wrote the article last week feds hijack silk road case
[02:14:55.040 --> 02:14:58.800]  in bid to dismantle internet freedom government using charges against ross
[02:14:58.800 --> 02:15:02.240]  olbrich as trojan horse to pass chilling laws
[02:15:02.240 --> 02:15:06.000]  that would make website owners criminally responsible for users actions
[02:15:06.000 --> 02:15:11.120]  and again i've already experienced the feds trying to trick me into this so
[02:15:11.120 --> 02:15:14.720]  this is serious people thank you very very much for coming on ma'am and we're
[02:15:14.720 --> 02:15:17.440]  sorry for what you and your family are going through
[02:15:17.440 --> 02:15:20.960]  oh thank you so much and thank you for the opportunity to talk about it i
[02:15:20.960 --> 02:15:24.640]  really appreciate that um one of the things that
[02:15:24.640 --> 02:15:28.960]  paul joseph watson wrote as well is that he said this is the biggest threat to
[02:15:28.960 --> 02:15:32.320]  the future of the internet since sofa and pipa
[02:15:32.320 --> 02:15:37.840]  that it's really very serious and that precedent will be set here
[02:15:37.840 --> 02:15:42.560]  um another attorney um scott greenfield on his blog simple justice
[02:15:42.560 --> 02:15:47.120]  he said this is the birth of law as applied to our digital future
[02:15:47.120 --> 02:15:50.480]  watch it as a spectator at your peril so
[02:15:50.480 --> 02:15:54.000]  the lawyers are watching it they know precedent will be set
[02:15:54.000 --> 02:15:58.960]  and um i'm trying to call attention to people this is much bigger than a case
[02:15:58.960 --> 02:16:05.120]  of my son one man or one website as you said it
[02:16:05.120 --> 02:16:08.800]  is ushering in and could potentially usher in precedent
[02:16:08.800 --> 02:16:11.920]  that could affect everyone and the kind of internet we're going to have in the
[02:16:11.920 --> 02:16:15.200]  21st century talk about your son's case for those
[02:16:15.200 --> 02:16:17.840]  that may not know about it's been publicized internationally but for
[02:16:17.840 --> 02:16:20.240]  those who don't know give us some background you've been talking to him
[02:16:20.240 --> 02:16:25.200]  how the case is going where he's being held how he's holding up
[02:16:25.200 --> 02:16:30.160]  yeah he's being held at mdc brooklyn which is a transitional facility
[02:16:30.160 --> 02:16:33.280]  it's the kind of place that people that come from federal prison go when can i
[02:16:33.280 --> 02:16:37.840]  go back to prison this place is horrible uh and he's been there for
[02:16:37.840 --> 02:16:43.760]  nine months he's only now recently been allowed to access
[02:16:43.760 --> 02:16:48.560]  discovery the evidence that the prosecutors have that was ordered in
[02:16:48.560 --> 02:16:53.040]  february there was a five month delay while we're waiting and waiting to have
[02:16:53.040 --> 02:16:57.360]  this so he can access it his trial is november third so it's
[02:16:57.360 --> 02:17:03.600]  quite the time constraint and so he's now working
[02:17:03.600 --> 02:17:07.840]  very diligently on that i on the other hand and my family
[02:17:07.840 --> 02:17:11.680]  are working at raising funds to pay his attorneys who are doing
[02:17:11.680 --> 02:17:17.440]  a great job and a mountain of work really working with us financially to
[02:17:17.440 --> 02:17:23.440]  fight this thing so his case is it's interesting there's
[02:17:23.440 --> 02:17:26.720]  some interesting aspects to it that we can talk about
[02:17:26.720 --> 02:17:31.520]  one of the main things that um joseph watson addresses in his
[02:17:31.520 --> 02:17:36.160]  article and what you touched on is the principle of transferred intent
[02:17:36.160 --> 02:17:41.280]  which makes one person responsible for the actions and even the intentions
[02:17:41.280 --> 02:17:44.480]  of another person and so in this case it would be
[02:17:44.480 --> 02:17:51.920]  the website host provides a platform makes him a conspirator
[02:17:51.920 --> 02:17:57.520]  and responsible for what users do on a site and you can just imagine
[02:17:57.520 --> 02:18:00.960]  what kind of precedent that could set and be impacted it could have on the
[02:18:00.960 --> 02:18:04.880]  internet making website hosts responsible for what users do on their
[02:18:04.880 --> 02:18:07.840]  site and i remember when this all broke i'd seen silk road
[02:18:07.840 --> 02:18:11.360]  before when mac when mackinville was talking about it a few years ago
[02:18:11.360 --> 02:18:16.320]  and i went and looked i mean it wasn't all discussions about drug culture and
[02:18:16.320 --> 02:18:20.080]  things that people were doing or how many red bulls to drink or whatever
[02:18:20.080 --> 02:18:22.960]  there was a lot of stuff going on on there
[02:18:22.960 --> 02:18:27.040]  but again it would just set a precedent that that i'm guilty
[02:18:27.040 --> 02:18:31.680]  when somebody goes on info wars dot com out of a million plus people a day
[02:18:31.680 --> 02:18:34.640]  and you know says uh we ought to shoot the president
[02:18:34.640 --> 02:18:37.680]  well i don't agree with that i don't want to make obama a martyr
[02:18:37.680 --> 02:18:41.600]  i don't agree i don't agree with offensive violence i'm a libertarian
[02:18:41.600 --> 02:18:47.680]  but i've had the feds here trying to imply i am and it's really scary
[02:18:47.680 --> 02:18:51.600]  yeah from what i understand from my research um i never was on silk road
[02:18:51.600 --> 02:18:54.960]  or you know i'm not that familiar with it directly
[02:18:54.960 --> 02:18:58.800]  is that it was designed to be an anonymous marketplace that
[02:18:58.800 --> 02:19:03.120]  had some restrictions as you mentioned but basically was consumer driven
[02:19:03.120 --> 02:19:07.360]  so if they wanted to sell on pasteurized milk and not drugs i mean it wasn't
[02:19:07.360 --> 02:19:10.960]  promoted as far as i can see as a drug website although that is what the
[02:19:10.960 --> 02:19:15.200]  prosecution is alleging um it was basically seems to me a free
[02:19:15.200 --> 02:19:19.760]  market experiment um i'm not saying it was all benign i'm just
[02:19:19.760 --> 02:19:21.760]  sure i mean i mean that's why they're talking about like
[02:19:21.760 --> 02:19:25.760]  basically getting rid of craigslist uh because sometimes people pick women up
[02:19:25.760 --> 02:19:27.680]  and kill them well i mean that could have been
[02:19:27.680 --> 02:19:30.000]  done in the old days with a phone book or at a bar
[02:19:30.000 --> 02:19:33.520]  i mean are you gonna ban walking up and talking to a woman at the tennis courts
[02:19:33.520 --> 02:19:38.880]  because you know a killer might do it i mean ted bundy picked women up with his
[02:19:38.880 --> 02:19:41.920]  Volkswagen in front of malls are we in a band
[02:19:41.920 --> 02:19:45.840]  going to malls because a bad guy might might pick women up there and kill them
[02:19:45.840 --> 02:19:50.080]  i mean it's just it's just so ridiculous that's all the internet is
[02:19:50.080 --> 02:19:54.000]  is the same as calling somebody on the telephone or or going to a flea market
[02:19:54.000 --> 02:19:56.800]  are we going to ban flea markets because somebody might be selling pot
[02:19:56.800 --> 02:20:00.080]  at the flea market we'll be right back stay with us

[02:24:31.280 --> 02:24:35.680]  facilitating this message board and marketplace where some people
[02:24:35.680 --> 02:24:38.400]  might have been discussing selling each other drugs
[02:24:38.400 --> 02:24:42.640]  you know we've seen the famous cases in Seattle that if I was your lawyer
[02:24:42.640 --> 02:24:47.040]  his lawyer I would be using as the example if it went to jury
[02:24:47.040 --> 02:24:51.680]  or to shake up the federal prosecution that gets about a 98%
[02:24:51.680 --> 02:24:55.440]  conviction rate because they'll rig stuff the only way to beat them
[02:24:55.440 --> 02:24:58.320]  is generally and I've talked to top lawyers on this is to bring out all
[02:24:58.320 --> 02:25:01.440]  their past corruption and to start campaigns against the
[02:25:01.440 --> 02:25:05.520]  prosecutors themselves and their corruption because they're usually
[02:25:05.520 --> 02:25:08.240]  so corrupt if you start an investigation of them they'll
[02:25:08.240 --> 02:25:10.640]  drop it and I'm just telling you how people really
[02:25:10.640 --> 02:25:15.280]  win it's because it's so rigged I would bring up cops known and feds known
[02:25:15.280 --> 02:25:20.880]  for selling each other drugs in in in restaurant or bar bathrooms
[02:25:20.880 --> 02:25:24.400]  not telling the court that that they're using a confidential informant
[02:25:24.400 --> 02:25:28.720]  and then using this to take the bar it's real famous in Seattle where over 100
[02:25:28.720 --> 02:25:32.160]  bars were owned by cops who had set up the bar
[02:25:32.160 --> 02:25:37.520]  themselves to take it over but but I'm just throwing out legal ideas here
[02:25:37.520 --> 02:25:42.640]  what exactly is he facing well one of the counts is a continuing criminal
[02:25:42.640 --> 02:25:47.680]  enterprise which is the kingpin charge I believe that has a mandatory minimum of
[02:25:47.680 --> 02:25:52.400]  30 years it may be 20 well I mean you know it gets to be
[02:25:52.400 --> 02:25:55.920]  you know we kind of ridiculous because there's four counts against him
[02:25:55.920 --> 02:26:01.600]  holder needs a kingpin I mean a holder's name should be kingpin
[02:26:01.600 --> 02:26:06.560]  holder in fact from now on that's his name kingpin holder
[02:26:06.560 --> 02:26:11.520]  I'm serious go ahead so kingpin holder who lets all these big banks
[02:26:11.520 --> 02:26:13.760]  launder hundreds of billions of drug money every year
[02:26:13.760 --> 02:26:18.960]  and all the rest of it he wants to put your son in jail for 30 years as a kingpin
[02:26:18.960 --> 02:26:26.240]  yeah and you know that's usually reserved for mafia bosses and drug cartel
[02:26:26.240 --> 02:26:30.560]  this is because he had a platform where other people they allegedly
[02:26:30.560 --> 02:26:34.960]  where other people did these things one of the things I wanted to point out was
[02:26:34.960 --> 02:26:38.400]  the kind of language they use in their replies and
[02:26:38.400 --> 02:26:42.880]  one of the things they say is well it's okay that our this doesn't really fit
[02:26:42.880 --> 02:26:47.040]  because federal laws are expansive and adaptable especially when it comes to
[02:26:47.040 --> 02:26:51.360]  the internet this isn't writing and I find that extremely alarming
[02:26:51.360 --> 02:26:54.960]  that they would think that in total opposition to the constitution oh yeah
[02:26:54.960 --> 02:26:58.000]  that's the season is just be as blatant as you can
[02:26:58.000 --> 02:27:03.520]  just just be open about the power grab right they just say it and they say the
[02:27:03.520 --> 02:27:08.160]  long arm of the law is far or the law is far longer
[02:27:08.160 --> 02:27:12.720]  than you would imagine this sort of thing it's very ominous language I wish that
[02:27:12.720 --> 02:27:17.280]  long arm would do something about itself
[02:27:17.280 --> 02:27:22.080]  oh count on that right um the other interesting thing you know congress
[02:27:22.080 --> 02:27:26.560]  passed in the 80s the communications decency act
[02:27:26.560 --> 02:27:31.760]  section 230 which protects website hosts from transferred intent you know
[02:27:31.760 --> 02:27:34.640]  being responsible for other people's actions and intentions
[02:27:34.640 --> 02:27:38.000]  in civil cases so if Ross were being sued
[02:27:38.000 --> 02:27:41.600]  by an individual in civil court for the exact same conduct
[02:27:41.600 --> 02:27:44.640]  he would be immune but because it's the federal government
[02:27:44.640 --> 02:27:48.240]  bringing the charges criminal charges in in federal court
[02:27:48.240 --> 02:27:52.960]  criminal court he's facing you know decades and decades
[02:27:52.960 --> 02:27:58.800]  and our lawyer says this is um arbitrary discriminatory enforcement but
[02:27:58.800 --> 02:28:02.480]  as well opens up a very dangerous anomaly
[02:28:02.480 --> 02:28:07.360]  that will be part of setting precedent for other website hosts
[02:28:07.360 --> 02:28:11.280]  to be held criminally liable well it's also a great way to set people up I mean
[02:28:11.280 --> 02:28:15.680]  you just send 2030 confidential federal informants
[02:28:15.680 --> 02:28:19.440]  on to the message board you don't like and have them all start talking about
[02:28:19.440 --> 02:28:23.920]  killing people or selling drugs or child porn and then you just go arrest
[02:28:23.920 --> 02:28:28.240]  whoever has that forum well that's really a good point because
[02:28:28.240 --> 02:28:33.040]  they say that intent all they need to be sufficiently
[02:28:33.040 --> 02:28:37.680]  prove intent is what happens on the forum what happens on the website
[02:28:37.680 --> 02:28:41.680]  doesn't have to be an actual act that they prove happened listen I've had the
[02:28:41.680 --> 02:28:46.240]  FBI asked me why I let people ask me why I let
[02:28:46.240 --> 02:28:49.840]  people threaten to kill cops on my website and I said well number one we
[02:28:49.840 --> 02:28:51.840]  have moderators and took it down number one
[02:28:51.840 --> 02:28:55.120]  there's tens of thousands about hundreds of thousands of posts a day
[02:28:55.120 --> 02:28:58.640]  and I said you I said you know what just get out of here
[02:28:58.640 --> 02:29:04.720]  but but again that's how bad they are I mean it's really creepy
[02:29:04.720 --> 02:29:08.400]  yeah and they could use this to expand that
[02:29:08.400 --> 02:29:12.640]  um I thought that Paul Joseph Watson made some other very interesting points
[02:29:12.640 --> 02:29:16.320]  as well he said it could lead to possible it is a
[02:29:16.320 --> 02:29:18.960]  is a website how it's responsible for hate speech
[02:29:18.960 --> 02:29:23.440]  can maybe taken you know held criminally liable for hate speech on comments
[02:29:23.440 --> 02:29:25.920]  I want to do five more minutes with you Lynn if you can and I'm going right to
[02:29:25.920 --> 02:29:29.120]  calls folks another breaking news and there is a bunch of breaking news
[02:29:29.120 --> 02:29:32.960]  border agent pulls gun on Boy Scouts detained for taking photos
[02:29:32.960 --> 02:29:37.520]  on the northern border but the southern borders wide open and they let
[02:29:37.520 --> 02:29:40.560]  border agents get shot nothing's they're not allowed to shoot back
[02:29:40.560 --> 02:29:44.160]  so the Mexican drug cartels shoot the board patrols told to run but Boy Scouts
[02:29:44.160 --> 02:29:47.440]  are out taking pictures so they come and point guns at their heads

[02:33:29.520 --> 02:33:33.680]  it's just when we had them calling up here going what's the obama deception
[02:33:33.680 --> 02:33:38.080]  asking people questions and then
[02:33:38.080 --> 02:33:42.080]  when they showed up they were asking us about the obama deception and saying
[02:33:42.080 --> 02:33:45.040]  you know why are these people on your site threatening police and i'm just
[02:33:45.040 --> 02:33:48.880]  like come on man you you've already talked to us
[02:33:48.880 --> 02:33:53.840]  that's happened a couple times by the way just on that front different ribs
[02:33:53.840 --> 02:33:57.360]  and you sit there and you start talking to them and you and you and you say
[02:33:57.360 --> 02:34:01.280]  you're really trying to set me up for no reason when you know full well i'm a
[02:34:01.280 --> 02:34:04.480]  good person and full well that we have moderators
[02:34:04.480 --> 02:34:08.160]  that took that down and full well that you're only here with
[02:34:08.160 --> 02:34:12.400]  a subpoena to find out who this person is and i'll comply with that subpoena
[02:34:12.400 --> 02:34:15.920]  because i don't agree with people doing stuff like that
[02:34:15.920 --> 02:34:21.120]  what is your problem and they started asking tim fruget questions i said tim
[02:34:21.120 --> 02:34:24.720]  don't answer their questions i think it's time for you guys to go
[02:34:24.720 --> 02:34:29.280]  i hope someday you become real americans i don't know how you sleep at night
[02:34:29.280 --> 02:34:32.640]  and when one guy was laughing and i said you don't know how corrupt the system
[02:34:32.640 --> 02:34:38.160]  is then he goes no i don't know i don't know that was another case
[02:34:38.160 --> 02:34:42.480]  and he's being sarcastic like it's funny like you're on a winning team
[02:34:42.480 --> 02:34:46.080]  with the corruption messing with the first amendment
[02:34:46.080 --> 02:34:50.160]  and messing with people that are trying to stop a civil war in this country
[02:34:50.160 --> 02:34:56.080]  and trying to keep civilization afloat it didn't gain folks when the borders wide
[02:34:56.080 --> 02:34:59.120]  open but they're pointing guns at boy scouts
[02:34:59.120 --> 02:35:02.160]  that were taking photos of a bridge for a book report
[02:35:02.160 --> 02:35:06.960]  so it just says in the local news report federal agents
[02:35:06.960 --> 02:35:13.760]  federal border agents probably customs ran over and put guns to their heads
[02:35:13.760 --> 02:35:17.120]  because they're trained like attack dogs citizens you go after
[02:35:17.120 --> 02:35:22.080]  illegals you red carpet veterans get put on death list
[02:35:22.080 --> 02:35:25.440]  illegals get free health care
[02:35:27.040 --> 02:35:32.080]  that's kcc i news we wrote a story about it kit daniels did an info wars dot
[02:35:32.080 --> 02:35:35.520]  com just broke now i'm gonna stop ranting
[02:35:35.520 --> 02:35:38.960]  lin albricht the mother of ross albricht free ross
[02:35:38.960 --> 02:35:44.720]  dot org everyone should try to politically support this young man
[02:35:44.720 --> 02:35:47.760]  because if because the site's still up and running and operating
[02:35:47.760 --> 02:35:51.760]  they just want to set the precedent to go after everybody else they've been
[02:35:51.760 --> 02:35:54.960]  trying this for a while and the problem is it's like
[02:35:54.960 --> 02:35:58.560]  erin schwarz man i'm not trying to scare you but i'm sure you thought of this
[02:35:58.560 --> 02:36:01.680]  when schwarz said he was going to battle him was going to defeat him and got
[02:36:01.680 --> 02:36:05.280]  engaged to be married i believe they went and killed him and hung him
[02:36:05.280 --> 02:36:08.560]  and then and then his father said he killed him with the pressure no i believe
[02:36:08.560 --> 02:36:12.400]  they killed erin schwarz because he was fighting similar things
[02:36:12.400 --> 02:36:16.720]  for publishing free open research at mit that was 30 years old
[02:36:16.720 --> 02:36:21.280]  as an example of being able to share files the public has paid for
[02:36:21.280 --> 02:36:25.120]  so i think your son because he's been chosen out of all this
[02:36:25.120 --> 02:36:28.080]  and they've tried to set up these file-sharing sites and others for music
[02:36:28.080 --> 02:36:33.120]  they've lost recently i think your son ross is in danger
[02:36:33.120 --> 02:36:42.400]  because he's in the hands of the real king pence
[02:36:42.400 --> 02:36:48.080]  we uh yeah that's very sobering um i wanted to let you know
[02:36:48.080 --> 02:36:52.720]  and uh and the lawyer just told me there's going to be another round of
[02:36:52.720 --> 02:36:56.640]  motions coming up at the end of july that's going to address cutting edge
[02:36:56.640 --> 02:37:01.440]  fourth amendment issues in the case and uh build on the recent supreme court
[02:37:01.440 --> 02:37:05.520]  opinion um on privacy in the digital age
[02:37:05.520 --> 02:37:08.480]  you know a lot of people are asking how the government find the silk road
[02:37:08.480 --> 02:37:12.160]  server um there's been lots of things floated about
[02:37:12.160 --> 02:37:15.920]  parallel construction in the case and so far the government has not answered
[02:37:15.920 --> 02:37:19.360]  that question uh so there's i think there's a lot more that's
[02:37:19.360 --> 02:37:25.040]  going to be addressed and coming out that'll be very interesting
[02:37:25.040 --> 02:37:30.000]  and meanwhile we need your help because um we have to fight this battle and we're
[02:37:30.000 --> 02:37:33.680]  fighting a goliath they have unlimited resources
[02:37:33.680 --> 02:37:38.160]  they um have unlimited manpower and we're a small group of people
[02:37:38.160 --> 02:37:43.520]  with very limited resources and um whatever help you can give if you can

[02:37:46.320 --> 02:37:51.200]  anyone to stand beside us with ideas skills um anything you can offer
[02:37:51.200 --> 02:37:54.640]  to help us fight this i i feel like it's a battle worth fighting it's going to
[02:37:54.640 --> 02:37:57.280]  impact all of us yeah and for those that don't know it came
[02:37:57.280 --> 02:38:02.240]  out in reuters uh last year in august just about a year ago on august 5th
[02:38:02.240 --> 02:38:05.040]  what i've been telling people that i was told by a
[02:38:05.040 --> 02:38:09.600]  mid-level dea agent uh at the gym one time he was putting his shirt on with
[02:38:09.600 --> 02:38:11.760]  his badge on his neck and he goes i've been looking at the weights with the guy for
[02:38:11.760 --> 02:38:15.920]  like a year and he goes alex don't tell anybody i'm dea oh my god i mean he
[02:38:15.920 --> 02:38:19.440]  goes and then i've never told anybody he was dea like big deal and then later he
[02:38:19.440 --> 02:38:23.840]  was pretty honest about he said look this is like 10 years ago he goes look
[02:38:23.840 --> 02:38:27.680]  it's all listened to we have access to everything what you say is true
[02:38:27.680 --> 02:38:30.960]  uh and we've got control of the switches at the telecoms
[02:38:30.960 --> 02:38:34.800]  well that's exactly what reuters then said that they're in
[02:38:34.800 --> 02:38:40.240]  everything everything your webcams everything you say on the phone they're
[02:38:40.240 --> 02:38:43.600]  in the nsa so they go lie in federal affidavits to
[02:38:43.600 --> 02:38:48.320]  judges and the judges know to certify it to then go use illegal evidence in
[02:38:48.320 --> 02:38:52.800]  court see it's systematic criminal operations and the argument is well
[02:38:52.800 --> 02:38:56.240]  we're stopping drug dealing no they're not they're only shutting down small
[02:38:56.240 --> 02:39:02.480]  cowboys and again i have had family in the cia
[02:39:02.480 --> 02:39:09.040]  well the army who did some of the cia uh who who said that they finally quit
[02:39:09.040 --> 02:39:13.440]  back in the 80s when they were sent to engage in drug dealing and assassinations
[02:39:13.440 --> 02:39:17.440]  in chicago uh and i mean that's just an example of how
[02:39:17.440 --> 02:39:21.360]  corrupt the system is it's the public is so naive
[02:39:21.360 --> 02:39:25.360]  all you can do is decriminalize and it's not the drug culture is good either
[02:39:25.360 --> 02:39:29.600]  it's terrible it's that the government just like the mafia and the government
[02:39:29.600 --> 02:39:33.040]  ran prohibition with alcohol and it tripled the size of the gangs and
[02:39:33.040 --> 02:39:36.640]  corrupted the government when they ended alcohol prohibition they brought out
[02:39:36.640 --> 02:39:40.880]  drug prohibition to be their new business and it's been growing ever
[02:39:40.880 --> 02:39:46.640]  since we have to discredit the whole system any comments to that
[02:39:46.640 --> 02:39:50.640]  well yeah i think that the people there's so many people in prison who are
[02:39:50.640 --> 02:39:56.080]  either innocent or nonviolent and it just seems like the um
[02:39:56.080 --> 02:40:00.160]  it's draconian how they're the repercussions for
[02:40:00.160 --> 02:40:03.680]  for these things and our prisons are just
[02:40:03.680 --> 02:40:11.760]  overflowing and um yes i um i you know agree that um we need to
[02:40:11.760 --> 02:40:17.920]  get back to the rule of law and um have fair trials and it's true i've heard
[02:40:17.920 --> 02:40:21.280]  over and over that the prosecution will throw everything at a person to try to
[02:40:21.280 --> 02:40:24.240]  get them to plead to things they didn't do
[02:40:24.240 --> 02:40:28.240]  necessarily do and that just seems wrong
[02:40:28.240 --> 02:40:32.000]  you shouldn't you have a right to a fair trial
[02:40:32.000 --> 02:40:35.680]  and that's what we're trying to get for ross again uh linda olbrich the mother
[02:40:35.680 --> 02:40:40.000]  of ross olbrich free ross dot org the silk road creator
[02:40:40.000 --> 02:40:44.240]  um how are his spirits after nine months in the federal federal
[02:40:44.240 --> 02:40:48.080]  dungeon well you know um ross is a very
[02:40:48.080 --> 02:40:51.920]  positive person by nature he's an austin boy by the way
[02:40:51.920 --> 02:40:55.920]  raised there and um but very positive and resilient
[02:40:55.920 --> 02:41:01.760]  and um sees the bigger picture in this and he stays positive he taught a
[02:41:01.760 --> 02:41:07.120]  physics class in there to inmates and a yoga class and he um
[02:41:07.120 --> 02:41:10.640]  now of course concentrating on discovery since he's finally been given the
[02:41:10.640 --> 02:41:15.600]  material so he stays he keeps his spirit up but it's a challenge it's not easy
[02:41:15.600 --> 02:41:19.760]  it's been very difficult and um i'm proud of him for how he's handling it but um
[02:41:19.760 --> 02:41:24.560]  yeah it's hard well he's taking it as a challenge in a boot camp and uh we'll
[02:41:24.560 --> 02:41:27.120]  all pray for him and i'm sure he'll get through this
[02:41:27.120 --> 02:41:30.720]  and i'll be another political prisoner uh when the history books are written when
[02:41:30.720 --> 02:41:33.120]  we defeat the globalist and bring him to justice but
[02:41:33.120 --> 02:41:36.640]  we have grown a giant vicious unaccountable evil
[02:41:36.640 --> 02:41:40.800]  wicked oppressive sickening kingpin government
[02:41:40.800 --> 02:41:43.920]  uh that now wants to shut down our free speech
[02:41:43.920 --> 02:41:46.560]  and and they're trying to overthrow every country that they don't control right
[02:41:46.560 --> 02:41:49.520]  now they've opened our borders they're just illegitimate
[02:41:49.520 --> 02:41:53.440]  and the good news is most feds i talk to are not even bad men or women
[02:41:53.440 --> 02:41:57.680]  but they have special cadres under the justice department that that are the
[02:41:57.680 --> 02:42:01.840]  political operatives and they're the folks going after your son
[02:42:01.840 --> 02:42:06.800]  and uh it's just it's it's it's disgusting all right well we'll get
[02:42:06.800 --> 02:42:11.840]  updates from you as this unfolds and i hope people will try to aid his defense
[02:42:11.840 --> 02:42:16.480]  at free ross dot o r g i know the electronic frontier foundation others
[02:42:16.480 --> 02:42:20.240]  are trying to help and i know that uh a lot of other
[02:42:20.240 --> 02:42:24.960]  folks are out there we're all gonna hang together hang separate thank you
[02:42:24.960 --> 02:42:28.720]  thank you elks thank you very much what a sweet lady
[02:42:28.720 --> 02:42:34.640]  uh wow and her son's very smart built a very successful powerful website
[02:42:34.640 --> 02:42:39.120]  and i have personally experienced uh this myself
[02:42:39.120 --> 02:42:46.000]  uh where they have gone around to almost every liberty reporter out there
[02:42:46.000 --> 02:42:49.840]  sending them with different reporters names even spoofing their email
[02:42:49.840 --> 02:42:55.600]  addresses child porn trying to get people to open it
[02:42:55.600 --> 02:43:00.320]  um we just don't open any attachments here unless we've talked to somebody
[02:43:00.320 --> 02:43:04.880]  over the telephone about it and can confirm they've sent it
[02:43:04.880 --> 02:43:08.880]  but the default position is when that happens
[02:43:08.880 --> 02:43:14.560]  we call the feds file reports and make them do work for sending it
[02:43:14.560 --> 02:43:18.320]  so if that ever happens to you you just expose the fact that that they're
[02:43:18.320 --> 02:43:23.040]  doing that um and i want to say something everybody's
[02:43:23.040 --> 02:43:26.800]  working with the system this thing will come down one way or another
[02:43:26.800 --> 02:43:30.640]  and you've signed on to stuff that makes the nazis look like
[02:43:30.640 --> 02:43:34.800]  amateurs i mean you're signed on to some really bad evil
[02:43:34.800 --> 02:43:39.680]  sky's the limit you name it it's going on and by your tacit go along get along
[02:43:39.680 --> 02:43:42.480]  all of you including the general public not just the feds
[02:43:42.480 --> 02:43:46.000]  you are now aiding and abetting this i am not aiding and abetting it
[02:43:46.000 --> 02:43:48.880]  i want to get as far away from this evil as i can that's why
[02:43:48.880 --> 02:43:56.720]  i'm boldly fighting it boldly boldly boldly
[02:43:56.720 --> 02:44:00.720]  because i'm in a death battle here i know they could set me up any moment kill
[02:44:00.720 --> 02:44:03.920]  me you name it i'm ready i don't like it i don't even get
[02:44:03.920 --> 02:44:09.520]  off on the thrill of it long time ago i did
[02:44:09.520 --> 02:44:13.760]  i'm committed to being a good person i'm committed to being honorable
[02:44:13.760 --> 02:44:17.360]  i'm committed to fulfilling my family name and i'm committed to bringing down
[02:44:17.360 --> 02:44:22.080]  tyranny i'm on the humanities team
[02:44:22.640 --> 02:44:26.400]  and it's because that's what i'm made of
[02:44:27.040 --> 02:44:30.640]  and i'm looking for a few good men out there and women
[02:44:30.640 --> 02:44:34.240]  who are looking for the same thing it's time to say no
[02:44:34.240 --> 02:44:37.680]  it's time to turn the corner stuff's gonna get a lot worse a lot quicker
[02:44:37.680 --> 02:44:41.200]  the system made us deny this was going on for a long time while they grew their
[02:44:41.200 --> 02:44:46.160]  premeditated takeover well we've caught them flat footed
[02:44:46.160 --> 02:44:48.160]  and the globalists know that and they're freaked out and all their
[02:44:48.160 --> 02:44:51.520]  communicators they say that they're losing the info war
[02:44:51.520 --> 02:44:55.520]  their own people are freaking out it's it's a gut check time
[02:44:55.520 --> 02:44:59.680]  i mean their own people now are faced with the fact of whoa
[02:44:59.680 --> 02:45:03.280]  this is really premeditated america destroying
[02:45:03.280 --> 02:45:08.320]  family destroying evil evil
[02:45:10.560 --> 02:45:15.600]  and the government's being converted right now to just absolute corruption
[02:45:15.600 --> 02:45:19.040]  there's a battle going on right now in corporations and governments and
[02:45:19.040 --> 02:45:21.520]  everywhere else
[02:45:22.000 --> 02:45:27.200]  about the future we're going to have we're going to collectively together
[02:45:27.200 --> 02:45:29.840]  about the decisions we make where we spend our money
[02:45:29.840 --> 02:45:34.640]  who we support what we do who we stand up against
[02:45:34.720 --> 02:45:39.440]  on whether this goes through or not complying being cowardly caring about
[02:45:39.440 --> 02:45:43.680]  political pressure caring about peer pressure
[02:45:43.680 --> 02:45:48.320]  that media creates political correctness has brought us to the verge
[02:45:48.320 --> 02:45:54.160]  of a ruination of rack and ruin
[02:45:54.400 --> 02:45:58.400]  we are on the verge everything you've seen is the table being set
[02:45:58.400 --> 02:46:01.920]  the feast hasn't begun but let me tell you they're dingin the
[02:46:01.920 --> 02:46:05.600]  dinner bell right now that's what all hell's breaking loose right now
[02:46:05.600 --> 02:46:08.080]  ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding
[02:46:08.080 --> 02:46:11.520]  dinner bell is activated
[02:46:11.520 --> 02:46:15.840]  dinner bell is activated and in the minute it takes
[02:46:15.840 --> 02:46:19.040]  everybody to get up from the kitchen in the living room
[02:46:19.040 --> 02:46:24.480]  and to go in and wash their hands and to sit down and start eating
[02:46:24.800 --> 02:46:30.720]  politically is about six months in my gut
[02:46:31.360 --> 02:46:36.400]  they're going to start eating us politically it's going to get bad
[02:46:36.400 --> 02:46:39.920]  all the tyranny you've seen is just the prelude
[02:46:39.920 --> 02:46:42.880]  the opening act
[02:46:44.160 --> 02:46:46.560]  it's actually in the thunderstorm blowing and you feel a little bit of wind
[02:46:46.560 --> 02:46:49.840]  if you smell ozone it feels good on your cheeks and 30 minutes later windows
[02:46:49.840 --> 02:46:54.880]  are breaking and trees are falling over all we've seen is just the wind
[02:46:54.880 --> 02:46:58.240]  a little bit of wind and now it's kind of kind of blowing us a little bit we're
[02:46:58.240 --> 02:47:02.400]  like ooh that storm's strong it's about to hit
[02:47:02.400 --> 02:47:10.160]  like a hurricane a typhoon
[02:47:10.160 --> 02:47:14.240]  and i feel sorry for people that hadn't batten down the hatches out there
[02:47:14.240 --> 02:47:17.360]  let's go to tim and maryland thanks for holding you're a trooper
[02:47:17.360 --> 02:47:22.720]  go ahead hey can you hear me yes sir hey how you doing alex it's great to talk
[02:47:22.720 --> 02:47:26.480]  to you i'm a big fan by a lot of your product thank you
[02:47:26.480 --> 02:47:30.160]  i got a question but i just wanted to put this out here
[02:47:30.160 --> 02:47:34.080]  for people that really just don't understand what's going on
[02:47:34.080 --> 02:47:37.840]  a lot of people just don't know the language of the way these people speak
[02:47:37.840 --> 02:47:40.880]  to us their listeners know exactly what they're doing
[02:47:40.880 --> 02:47:45.040]  you can see it in the hollywood the political people all the demonic
[02:47:45.040 --> 02:47:47.840]  symbolism they use they're telling you who they worship
[02:47:47.840 --> 02:47:53.040]  what side they're on and pretty much i get i get frustrated with people try to
[02:47:53.040 --> 02:47:57.600]  write you off like this i'd be like oh you're crazy
[02:47:57.600 --> 02:48:00.720]  you think the illuminati's gonna get us but like when you really
[02:48:00.720 --> 02:48:04.720]  dig deep into it and do your research like the average person doesn't even
[02:48:04.720 --> 02:48:08.080]  know what the illuminati is or what it's even about
[02:48:08.080 --> 02:48:11.280]  or who's just what the spider is that they're in the middle of the web with
[02:48:11.280 --> 02:48:14.880]  the illuminati so once you figure that out and you
[02:48:14.880 --> 02:48:17.920]  figure out that it's more in a physical battle and that's
[02:48:17.920 --> 02:48:22.800]  really a spiritual battle that we're getting that that's coming upon us
[02:48:22.800 --> 02:48:26.400]  and i honestly feel like like you said about all the babies we were
[02:48:26.400 --> 02:48:29.120]  we were boarded and i haven't done the right thing
[02:48:29.120 --> 02:48:32.640]  on my life but i've got my life saved i gave it to christ
[02:48:32.640 --> 02:48:36.880]  and he's uh and i know he's forgiven me you know i was uh
[02:48:36.880 --> 02:48:40.240]  i was like 15 years old and i didn't i didn't know any better than i had in
[02:48:40.240 --> 02:48:43.440]  abortion and you know i ran the streets i've
[02:48:43.440 --> 02:48:46.560]  done all sorts of stuff i'm not proud about you know like selling
[02:48:46.560 --> 02:48:50.640]  selling drugs and you know just just being out on the corner
[02:48:50.640 --> 02:48:54.400]  just not knowing that there's something better out here for all of us
[02:48:54.400 --> 02:48:57.760]  because like you talked to a lot of people in the inner city and i live in
[02:48:57.760 --> 02:49:01.840]  baltimore now and i grew up in texas so it's like
[02:49:01.840 --> 02:49:05.360]  i go down to the city and it's like you see a bomb
[02:49:05.360 --> 02:49:09.440]  and i don't i mean no disrespect but you see a bomb on every corner
[02:49:09.440 --> 02:49:13.280]  and it's it's it's heartbreaking because like you say about like people like
[02:49:13.280 --> 02:49:17.360]  george bush people give some kind of they feel some kind of way when they give
[02:49:17.360 --> 02:49:20.080]  money to these people like they're doing something good but they don't know
[02:49:20.080 --> 02:49:23.120]  their real motive they don't know their real agenda behind what
[02:49:23.120 --> 02:49:26.240]  they're doing and then you see these veterans on the street
[02:49:26.240 --> 02:49:30.160]  you see that with missing arm and missing leg begging for money and it really
[02:49:30.160 --> 02:49:33.680]  just breaks my heart how insensitive people are
[02:49:33.680 --> 02:49:37.280]  to the common man that's standing right next to you but you're going to willing
[02:49:37.280 --> 02:49:39.920]  to keep your money to one of these don't listen to
[02:49:39.920 --> 02:49:44.880]  hillary speaker go buy the newest jvcd and you don't even know what jvc
[02:49:44.880 --> 02:49:47.440]  represents and like i was talking about with the
[02:49:47.440 --> 02:49:50.960]  spiritual about it people are getting caught up
[02:49:50.960 --> 02:49:54.320]  i really feel like we're being judged right now honestly
[02:49:54.320 --> 02:49:59.520]  i feel like i'm not saying god is taking his heads of protection off of us or

[02:56:35.120 --> 02:56:39.840]  alex great presentations today thank you i uh want to talk to you about the
[02:56:39.840 --> 02:56:42.800]  opportunity for opening up a new front in the info war
[02:56:42.800 --> 02:56:47.680]  just a few quick uh thoughts on it you often refer to the rights of passage
[02:56:47.680 --> 02:56:51.520]  which men and women come across that they uh
[02:56:51.520 --> 02:56:56.080]  cross over a threshold and develop into uh you know to the next level of
[02:56:56.080 --> 02:56:59.280]  themselves and what i think we're dealing with with
[02:56:59.280 --> 02:57:02.320]  a lot of the people that are coming to this country from
[02:57:02.320 --> 02:57:06.160]  third world nations so to speak is that we're dealing with a whole
[02:57:06.160 --> 02:57:09.440]  group of people that have never been up they're stunted
[02:57:09.440 --> 02:57:13.200]  they've never been allowed to understand what freedom is
[02:57:13.200 --> 02:57:19.120]  is and what self-determination is and although i am not for the illegal
[02:57:19.120 --> 02:57:22.720]  immigration i do believe that we have the opportunity to speak
[02:57:22.720 --> 02:57:26.880]  directly to these people in their languages
[02:57:26.880 --> 02:57:30.400]  to them oh yeah there listen the democrats are reaching out to them
[02:57:30.400 --> 02:57:33.200]  and that's how they're converting them over to them that's why they want the
[02:57:33.200 --> 02:57:36.560]  poorest latin americans who've literally lived in dirt shacks and are just
[02:57:36.560 --> 02:57:41.280]  desperate to get food uh because they don't want the middle class
[02:57:41.280 --> 02:57:44.480]  latin americans coming up here because they they'd be great
[02:57:44.480 --> 02:57:48.960]  to get up here i mean they work hard smart you know got it all together
[02:57:48.960 --> 02:57:52.560]  they want unwashed people up here because they'll fall right into the
[02:57:52.560 --> 02:57:56.800]  democrats hands the democrats are giving them a fish
[02:57:56.800 --> 02:58:02.400]  why don't we teach them how to fish i agree but the influx is so huge
[02:58:02.400 --> 02:58:06.000]  that we could never do that i mean even the feds aren't able to handle these
[02:58:06.000 --> 02:58:10.640]  numbers just a ground war just another front i
[02:58:10.640 --> 02:58:15.040]  agree with with your views on the other points and i'm not making the case
[02:58:15.040 --> 02:58:20.160]  for the illegal crossing and no i hear you but we've got to convert them to
[02:58:20.160 --> 02:58:24.000]  liberty we don't want to be the enemies with
[02:58:24.000 --> 02:58:27.680]  these people we want to understand that they're being directed
[02:58:27.680 --> 02:58:31.760]  and try and actually i found that they're the probably some of the most

[03:00:37.360 --> 03:00:41.760]  like our governor quomo up here pretty much carbon copies of each other
[03:00:41.760 --> 03:00:46.320]  they act the exact same way the only thing that i wanted to say is that um
[03:00:46.320 --> 03:00:49.680]  here last week on our local news they have a mailing
[03:00:49.680 --> 03:00:52.720]  center up here its name is the sikorsky mailing
[03:00:52.720 --> 03:00:55.920]  center it's in big flats new york at the almyra
[03:00:55.920 --> 03:00:59.200]  corning regional airport they wanted to put
[03:00:59.200 --> 03:01:04.400]  uh immigration facility in there and the only reason why they got turned down
[03:01:04.400 --> 03:01:08.960]  supposedly was because of faa regulations i'm just wondering if that
[03:01:08.960 --> 03:01:13.840]  might be a ruse to to try to you know to try to
[03:01:13.840 --> 03:01:18.160]  stop people stop people from opposing that absolutely they're putting them on
[03:01:18.160 --> 03:01:21.440]  military bases we caught them building a huge secret fema camp
[03:01:21.440 --> 03:01:24.640]  on the border last week our reporters are going back down there right now
[03:01:24.640 --> 03:01:28.960]  to bust them there get them ready and then deploy them
[03:01:28.960 --> 03:01:33.440]  and then through different federal agencies with the 3.7 billion obama
[03:01:33.440 --> 03:01:37.440]  wants just for the summer they pay democrat families
[03:01:37.440 --> 03:01:42.000]  six thousand dollars a month for a new business to then get the illegals get
[03:01:42.000 --> 03:01:45.520]  them drivers license and get them ready to vote to take the guns
[03:01:45.520 --> 03:01:48.560]  so it's a organized racketeering criminal operation
[03:01:48.560 --> 03:01:52.080]  that's what obama is doing with the border organized criminal op
[03:01:52.080 --> 03:01:55.120]  hiding in plain view they should all be arrested
[03:01:55.120 --> 03:01:59.440]  agree um yeah that's pretty much all that i want to say
[03:01:59.440 --> 03:02:04.960]  great points brother have a great day mj in illinois you're on the air go ahead
[03:02:04.960 --> 03:02:08.720]  okay right quick alex um when i heard about rick perry
[03:02:08.720 --> 03:02:11.760]  i just wanted to say i didn't trust him because i think one of the reasons why
[03:02:11.760 --> 03:02:15.360]  he's doing this tactic is because i think he's positioning himself to
[03:02:15.360 --> 03:02:19.200]  potentially run for president of course again that's why where his class is now
[03:02:19.200 --> 03:02:22.560]  it's a reinvention of him the big republicans thought he would get in
[03:02:22.560 --> 03:02:25.840]  last time i mean they i mean they really like him
[03:02:25.840 --> 03:02:29.520]  one other quick point alex i have a issue with ted cruise
[03:02:29.520 --> 03:02:33.120]  um i i the verdict is out with him as far as me trusting him
[03:02:33.120 --> 03:02:37.520]  i know this past weekend the propaganda's glenn beck was on the border handing out
[03:02:37.520 --> 03:02:41.360]  the soccer balls and the stuffed animals with the kids serving meals
[03:02:41.360 --> 03:02:45.600]  and ted cruise was alongside with him a few months prior
[03:02:45.600 --> 03:02:49.840]  ted cruise was at dinner with newt gingers and a couple other neacon talk
[03:02:49.840 --> 03:02:52.720]  show host oh i know listen he's a he's a lawyer
[03:02:52.720 --> 03:02:56.640]  he's a politician he's positioning himself to run in one for president

[03:03:04.880 --> 03:03:09.440]  uh so i mean you know rick perry has a good bunch of good talk
[03:03:09.440 --> 03:03:12.960]  i mean ted cruise says obama's imploding the border on purpose
[03:03:12.960 --> 03:03:16.640]  and it's scary and a tyrant we don't hear that out of rick perry
[03:03:16.640 --> 03:03:21.360]  we hear that out of rand paul so yeah i mean i i totally trust rand paul
[03:03:21.360 --> 03:03:25.360]  i 90 trust i like ted cruise but it's qualified
[03:03:25.360 --> 03:03:28.720]  because we just we don't know him long enough yet and then when you talk about
[03:03:28.720 --> 03:03:30.720]  something like newt yenridge i mean give me a break
[03:03:30.720 --> 03:03:33.600]  he wrote multiple books calling for world government
[03:03:33.600 --> 03:03:37.040]  and microchipping the entire population i'm not kidding
[03:03:37.040 --> 03:03:42.960]  so i mean yenridge is horrible i hear you i appreciate your call mj
[03:03:42.960 --> 03:03:46.800]  jordan in north carolina you're on the air go ahead
[03:03:46.800 --> 03:03:50.880]  hey mr jones uh my name's jordan i'm from north carolina welcome
[03:03:50.880 --> 03:03:55.120]  20 years old i just wanted to encourage you and thank you um
[03:03:55.120 --> 03:03:58.000]  you have young people listening and i mean i really feel like that's what
[03:03:58.000 --> 03:04:00.880]  matters right now not that other people and other
[03:04:00.880 --> 03:04:04.480]  generations don't matter but i mean my generation is the one that's going to
[03:04:04.480 --> 03:04:09.280]  have to deal with the majority of this and i agree people've always said that
[03:04:09.280 --> 03:04:12.240]  but but now we're all going to deal with it it's here
[03:04:12.240 --> 03:04:16.000]  but yes a lot of older folks have been set in their ways
[03:04:16.000 --> 03:04:19.600]  and the globalists are targeting young people young people need to step up and
[03:04:19.600 --> 03:04:22.960]  be leaders like you're doing and and and and let people know what's
[03:04:22.960 --> 03:04:26.640]  happening and ron paul talks about it the young people are really waking up
[03:04:26.640 --> 03:04:30.480]  right now so it's a very positive thing right and exactly
[03:04:30.480 --> 03:04:33.360]  that's what i'm getting at um i know this affects us all
[03:04:33.360 --> 03:04:37.280]  directly every day whether we feel it see it or not but um
[03:04:37.280 --> 03:04:40.640]  what i wanted to ask you or what are things that i can really target on that
[03:04:40.640 --> 03:04:44.400]  are happening to my generation that i can be like hey look this is right in
[03:04:44.400 --> 03:04:48.720]  your face like whether you see it or not i mean it's so easy to try and talk to
[03:04:48.720 --> 03:04:52.160]  people about stuff like this yeah people are ready to hear now and a lot
[03:04:52.160 --> 03:04:56.160]  people think they're disempowered so they think oh what can i do
[03:04:56.160 --> 03:05:01.040]  well the teacher may have power like buying organic
