[00:00.000 --> 00:11.400]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well
[00:11.400 --> 00:18.960]  so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin
[00:18.960 --> 00:24.640]  Texas Alex Jones John McCain one-man
[00:24.640 --> 00:30.160]  Hungarian dialectic in motion playing both sides to successfully roll out 53
[00:30.160 --> 00:36.160]  annual defense bills and blaze a trail of unchecked ties to ISIS leaders are we
[00:36.160 --> 00:43.160]  completely lost our sense of any moral caring and concern about thousands and
[00:43.160 --> 00:47.800]  thousands of people who are murdered who are made refugees who are dying as we
[00:47.800 --> 00:54.600]  speak and the president secretary of state says that we should not light our
[00:54.600 --> 01:01.240]  hair on fire do we give a damn about what's happening in the streets of
[01:01.240 --> 01:06.360]  Ramadi and the thousands of refugees and the people and innocent men women and
[01:06.360 --> 01:10.160]  children that are dying and being executed and their bodies burned in the
[01:10.160 --> 01:16.720]  street everyone in the national security team recommended arming ISIS and the
[01:16.720 --> 01:20.800]  president by himself turned it down we've determined that Bashar Assad has
[01:20.800 --> 01:24.800]  killed about a hundred a hundred and fifty people with chemical weapons Seymour
[01:24.800 --> 01:28.920]  Hirsch says Barack Obama refused to acknowledge the fact that the Al Qaeda
[01:28.920 --> 01:34.280]  affiliated al-Nusra front was a suspect of the crime they want to get Iran to get
[01:34.280 --> 01:38.200]  Iran they wanted to stabilize Syria that's the whole point and they're
[01:38.200 --> 01:41.840]  trying to find it which method is going to work better they decide they probably
[01:41.840 --> 01:47.240]  better invade with troops and then the pretext is going to be Assad's a bad guy
[01:47.240 --> 01:53.720]  who uses chemical weapons now if this cover story is created in 2012 maybe
[01:53.720 --> 01:59.680]  before and we're just playing it out today this is obviously you know making
[01:59.680 --> 02:04.760]  the facts fit a lie now McCain has been roped in once again to ISIS McCain
[02:04.760 --> 02:08.960]  responded on his official Twitter account remarking another nutty conspiracy
[02:08.960 --> 02:12.840]  theory from the Russian internet trolls I'm very proud to be a target of
[02:12.840 --> 02:18.360]  America's enemies in a response to a staged ISIS beheading video which pro
[02:18.360 --> 02:23.880]  Russian hackers claim was found on one of his staffers electronic devices pro
[02:23.880 --> 02:29.040]  Moscow hacktivist outfit cyber Burkitt released the video cyber Burkitt
[02:29.040 --> 02:33.520]  previously took credit for hacking NATO websites and obtaining correspondence
[02:33.520 --> 02:37.840]  from within the United States Embassy in Ukraine the group insisted that the
[02:37.840 --> 02:41.440]  footage was hacked from a device belonging to one of McCain's assistants
[02:41.440 --> 02:46.680]  during a trip to Ukraine last month but there was no accompanying evidence for
[02:46.680 --> 02:51.280]  this claim the video replete with desert scenery professional lighting and a
[02:51.280 --> 02:56.240]  director appears to be the same video doled out to the masses through the
[02:56.240 --> 03:00.640]  propaganda arm of the Pentagon look at this video from Turkish media network
[03:00.640 --> 03:09.240]  canal D's highly successful TV show Valley of the Wolves it shows the exact
[03:09.240 --> 03:14.400]  same setup as the recent beheading videos from ISIS he followed up with a
[03:14.400 --> 03:18.040]  subsequent tweet in which he stated first they doctored pictures to say I
[03:18.040 --> 03:23.880]  met with ISIS now Russian internet trolls say I staged ISIS executions proud
[03:23.880 --> 03:28.600]  to be their number one adversary but are we supposed to just look the other way
[03:28.600 --> 03:32.960]  mr. McCain when you're a pictured meeting with the likes of Abdul Hakim
[03:32.960 --> 03:38.400]  Belhaj who's now the leader of ISIS forces in Libya Belhaj who implemented
[03:38.400 --> 03:43.920]  the brutality of Sharia law in Libya and worked directly with US and NATO forces
[03:43.920 --> 03:47.680]  during the overthrow of Gaddafi and let's be honest here there's clear evidence
[03:47.680 --> 03:51.960]  in my judgment that the Libya consulate that was attacked on the 9-11
[03:51.960 --> 03:55.240]  anniversary was very much involved in moving you know obtaining surface
[03:55.240 --> 03:59.080]  terror missiles and other arms militias and transferring of the other Turks to
[03:59.080 --> 04:03.600]  the rebels in Syria I just don't think it's in our interest to be doing that
[04:03.600 --> 04:06.400]  sort of thing based on the fact that you mentioned Alex the chances are pretty
[04:06.400 --> 04:10.160]  good it's all gonna come back and fight us some day how do we know that the
[04:10.160 --> 04:14.720]  arms that are going to the Syrian rebels are not gonna get into the hands of
[04:14.720 --> 04:19.400]  ISIS because if we had people who could were there to funnel it to the right
[04:19.400 --> 04:23.080]  people and I know these people and I know who they are and I know how to do
[04:23.080 --> 04:27.920]  it and so do other people tomorrow about the arms deal from Benghazi getting
[04:27.920 --> 04:33.040]  into the hands of the Syrian rebels that didn't happen the 15,000 stinger
[04:33.040 --> 04:37.360]  missiles didn't happen it didn't happen it didn't happen why would you think such
[04:37.360 --> 04:41.880]  a thing ponds like senator John McCain would have us believe that two plus two
[04:41.880 --> 04:47.560]  equals five that the sky isn't blue as the stench of treason wafts through the
[04:47.560 --> 04:51.560]  halls of Congress well no no no I don't we're gonna have a fight because it's
[04:51.560 --> 04:55.640]  patently falls this is the same Rand Paul that said we didn't want to have
[04:55.640 --> 05:00.360]  anything to do with with anything to do in the Middle East by the way I prefer
[05:00.360 --> 05:07.040]  Barack Obama for George W. Bush well if you haven't figured it out by now these
[05:07.040 --> 05:11.640]  guys are corporate spokesman they're not leaders I mean they both started
[05:11.640 --> 05:16.000]  illegal wars hell they both tortured people they bailed out criminal
[05:16.000 --> 05:21.280]  corporations and they spied on you they both violated the Constitution and they
[05:21.280 --> 05:25.760]  even committed war crimes so what's it gonna take I mean what will it take to
[05:25.760 --> 05:30.520]  finally wake you up think about it if Joseph Stalin ran for president as a
[05:30.520 --> 05:35.520]  Democrat and Adolf Hitler ran as a Republican one of them would end up
[05:35.520 --> 05:41.160]  leading our country its politics incorporated in your choice between the
[05:41.160 --> 05:46.760]  two parties is a myth because in reality it is a two-party tyranny with one

[08:14.960 --> 08:33.200]  of the info war
[08:33.200 --> 08:41.000]  welcome my friends it is Tuesday the 21st day of July 2015 I'm your host Alex
[08:41.000 --> 08:46.880]  Jones and there's so much important news today that I had cleared the decks of
[08:46.880 --> 08:51.160]  two guests that we already had booked for the broadcast and we're going to
[08:51.160 --> 08:55.960]  reschedule both Larry Nichols the Clinton insider with the latest intel and
[08:55.960 --> 09:03.960]  Tosh Plumlee the CIA whistleblower to interviews next week but then getting
[09:03.960 --> 09:10.720]  into the office I knew that yesterday Joe Biggs info wars reporter had gone out
[09:10.720 --> 09:17.320]  to the different armed services recruiting centers in central Texas to
[09:17.320 --> 09:24.200]  investigate what they were basically doing to protect themselves and to draw
[09:24.200 --> 09:27.000]  attention to the fact that they're not allowed to be armed when they're
[09:27.000 --> 09:31.480]  obviously soft targets and something that Islamic extremists have been
[09:31.480 --> 09:34.960]  targeting for years there's not just the attack of last week or the Garland
[09:34.960 --> 09:39.880]  situation there have been other Army Navy Air Force Marine recruiting
[09:39.880 --> 09:44.480]  centers that have been attacked before but it's kept very quiet and is out of
[09:44.480 --> 09:52.600]  the headlines very quick whenever you see a situation like a white
[09:52.600 --> 09:57.080]  supremacist who's on amnesiac drugs going in and killing nine innocent black
[09:57.080 --> 10:01.600]  people it's made the biggest news story for a month used to remove Confederate
[10:01.600 --> 10:07.400]  flags to try to pass anti-free speech laws to have Homeland Security get more
[10:07.400 --> 10:13.240]  funding under FEMA to set up a domestic extremist monitoring network of secret
[10:13.240 --> 10:19.960]  police but when you have foreigners pouring in who aren't compatible because
[10:19.960 --> 10:26.320]  of their Wahhabist Saudi Arabia extremist background we're told that we
[10:26.320 --> 10:31.240]  need to just understand it's not terrorism and so I've been on the phone
[10:31.240 --> 10:35.880]  with Joe Biggs jacari Jackson is out there with him as well they're going to
[10:35.880 --> 10:46.120]  be on with us at 1208 or eight minutes into the next hour at the major Army
[10:46.120 --> 10:51.640]  Navy Marine Corps Air Force recruiting center at South Park Meadows in South
[10:51.640 --> 10:59.000]  Austin Paul Watson is going to do a quick article on this and then we're
[10:59.000 --> 11:03.360]  going to have video by the next hour to add to the article here is the breaking
[11:03.360 --> 11:12.600]  news Joe went out there to several different recruiting centers and the
[11:12.600 --> 11:16.160]  recruiters inside wouldn't talk to him said we've been ordered not to talk to
[11:16.160 --> 11:22.320]  anybody that was two days ago he went back out there yesterday in his Army
[11:22.320 --> 11:31.680]  uniform with a head down 556 m4 and they appreciated the protection and said
[11:31.680 --> 11:34.720]  okay come on in we're gonna tell you what's going on we're getting death
[11:34.720 --> 11:41.880]  threats at recruiting centers all over the country in Las Vegas in areas of
[11:41.880 --> 11:46.480]  Florida and we're getting activity we're not even supposed to tell you about the
[11:46.480 --> 11:51.960]  specifics right here in central Texas in San Marcos and we've reached out to
[11:51.960 --> 11:56.280]  San Marcos they say they're not allowed to talk about it while Biggs was there a
[11:56.280 --> 12:03.520]  guy in a beat-up Marine Corps uniform was driving around in circles around the
[12:03.520 --> 12:07.880]  recruiting center at South Park Meadows while he was standing guard for seven
[12:07.880 --> 12:16.360]  hours yesterday pulled up looked at Biggs rolled down the window was Arabic gave
[12:16.360 --> 12:21.680]  Biggs a very suspicious look and sped off it appears there are people just
[12:21.680 --> 12:26.800]  where he's at that are casing things and there are phone calls being made and
[12:26.800 --> 12:33.240]  threats and they've been told don't talk about it again ISIS was allowed to
[12:33.240 --> 12:39.440]  recruit on Facebook on YouTube on Twitter the Free Syrian Army for five
[12:39.440 --> 12:45.160]  years has been recruiting in the United States the UK and Europe heavily they get
[12:45.160 --> 12:53.480]  more fighters from Europe in the United States and from the stands under Russia
[12:53.480 --> 13:00.080]  then they do out of Saudi Arabia and Qatar and other areas so they've allowed
[13:00.080 --> 13:04.200]  to recruit these groups they've put them in power they've changed the name to
[13:04.200 --> 13:09.280]  ISIS Obama has said the answer isn't bombing them and what you've got is
[13:09.280 --> 13:18.760]  fellow travelers who are buying into the ideology lone wolves bots operating on
[13:18.760 --> 13:22.920]  their own the globalists don't want this they want a Saudi Arabian NATO backed
[13:22.920 --> 13:27.400]  proxy army that the Pentagon's exposed two years ago and told Obama they weren't
[13:27.400 --> 13:31.840]  gonna back so they just switched this new strategy so sort of the Pentagon's
[13:31.840 --> 13:35.200]  credit into the military's credit they've been not going along with this and
[13:35.200 --> 13:40.520]  dragging their feet and leaking the information they don't want these attacks
[13:40.520 --> 13:44.320]  because it exposes that the West is supporting these groups and the borders
[13:44.320 --> 13:49.240]  wide open that's why there can be five more attacks ten more attacks 20 more
[13:49.240 --> 13:53.320]  attacks they are never gonna say it's Islamic extremism they could attack
[13:53.320 --> 13:59.560]  police departments shopping malls schools anything they're doing this there
[13:59.560 --> 14:05.400]  were more attacks all over the Middle East Africa and Europe this week ships
[14:05.400 --> 14:09.760]  getting blown up refineries getting blown up France is getting hit every few
[14:09.760 --> 14:13.320]  days they're covering most of them up just saying oh this refinery blew up
[14:13.320 --> 14:18.400]  that refinery blew up somebody just shot a cop we don't know what's going on the
[14:18.400 --> 14:23.160]  political correctness so they can bring in the massive numbers of people whose
[14:23.160 --> 14:27.800]  cultures aren't compatible and then play off the clash of civilizations use the
[14:27.800 --> 14:32.240]  threat as a way to federalize local police which they'll then double back and
[14:32.240 --> 14:36.560]  use on the Patriots the veterans the gun owners which Homeland Security admits
[14:36.560 --> 14:44.720]  is the domestic terror and their main enemy now even the Washington Post had
[14:44.720 --> 14:49.960]  to admit that there are big demonstrations that the Army recruiting
[14:49.960 --> 14:56.880]  centers in Chattanooga the Marine Corps recruiting centers and other centers by
[14:56.880 --> 15:02.880]  people that understand what's going on they invoked Islamophobia to go take
[15:02.880 --> 15:07.120]  out Iraq that hadn't done anything to us and was opposing radical Jihad and not
[15:07.120 --> 15:11.520]  lionizing Saddam the truth is he was a good guy compared to these people they're
[15:11.520 --> 15:14.560]  trying to take out a sod a good guy compared to these people a good guy
[15:14.560 --> 15:18.720]  compared to Saddam by the way of all these people one of the better people
[15:18.720 --> 15:23.520]  some could say actually a good guy Gaddafi not a good guy but starts working
[15:23.520 --> 15:27.240]  with the West for eight years get set up they bring in Al Qaeda ruin the country
[15:27.240 --> 15:35.480]  that was the plan this is so big and I got so upset when I learned about this
[15:35.480 --> 15:39.640]  and I mean this isn't an act the crew knows it I could barely go on air 15
[15:39.640 --> 15:44.000]  minutes ago and luckily we had a John Bowne report on this very subject how
[15:44.000 --> 15:48.400]  John McCain has been caught funding the Free Syrian Army and ISIS so it fit in
[15:48.400 --> 15:58.760]  together see this is a normal response to physically get angry physically because
[15:58.760 --> 16:04.800]  I projected out my mind how the story will go it'll probably be ignored nothing
[16:04.800 --> 16:16.320]  will be done about it there'll be more attacks it's insane by the way called
[16:16.320 --> 16:19.760]  Joe I know he's followed a report we're just gonna go to him live next hour we
[16:19.760 --> 16:23.280]  please have him tweets we can add it to Watson's article five or six tweets
[16:23.280 --> 16:27.480]  breaking down what happened that he's here in Austin South Park meadows was
[16:27.480 --> 16:31.600]  told they're getting threats all over the country everything you told me that
[16:31.600 --> 16:35.520]  they've been told that they're not supposed to talk to the media and that
[16:35.520 --> 16:39.440]  they're really concerned and they know they're sitting ducks because we're
[16:39.440 --> 16:44.160]  breaking the fact that we were told by the people we're not gonna say who but
[16:44.160 --> 16:50.400]  the folks that work there that yes they're getting confirmed reports from
[16:50.400 --> 16:55.240]  Nevada from Florida and other states that they're getting threats and they're
[16:55.240 --> 17:00.960]  getting threats in San Marcos but aren't at liberty to go into details that's
[17:00.960 --> 17:09.000]  south of Austin we have the governor's calling for arming the recruiting
[17:09.000 --> 17:18.240]  centers but it's insane especially in states where it's legal to own guns why
[17:18.240 --> 17:24.720]  don't we just have folks that have concealed carry who are off-duty be able
[17:24.720 --> 17:30.120]  to then when they're on duty have a sidearm and it's because for the last
[17:30.120 --> 17:34.360]  decade or so anytime a high-level operative of the globalist Secretary
[17:34.360 --> 17:38.720]  of State Defense Department secretary you name it is at a base they disarm all
[17:38.720 --> 17:43.800]  the trips knowing that there's a very low probability but it could happen that
[17:43.800 --> 17:46.880]  one I'm gonna shoot somebody see that's their attitude they want every one
[17:46.880 --> 17:52.680]  disarmed and all of this is going on in the midst of the vets who are on
[17:52.680 --> 17:57.000]  basically any form of disability it's not just mental problems not just
[17:57.000 --> 18:00.920]  diagnosed with PTSD or whatever which they hand that designation out like
[18:00.920 --> 18:05.280]  it's nothing that then you're told sorry you can't buy guns anymore and the
[18:05.280 --> 18:11.280]  police are coming by mr. Johnson mr. Sanchez mr. Chowl whatever your name is
[18:11.280 --> 18:15.040]  every race color and creed you're being screwed over you're having your rights
[18:15.040 --> 18:20.800]  taken and it's been done to the vets well even longer than 10 years Clinton
[18:20.800 --> 18:24.560]  started it it kind of stopped under Bush started up at the end of his
[18:24.560 --> 18:30.600]  administration and then it's been in hyper warp since Obama got in and they've
[18:30.600 --> 18:36.120]  disarmed over a million veterans under Obama and you'll read the Bloomberg
[18:36.120 --> 18:40.000]  headlines gun confiscations begin in California the federally funded task
[18:40.000 --> 18:44.120]  force has a list today more than 50 people they're gonna visit most of them
[18:44.120 --> 18:50.640]  veterans that are disabled or have PTSD or who have traumatic brain injuries so
[18:50.640 --> 18:55.800]  imagine you can hardly talk but you're you still got your IQ you got blown up in
[18:55.800 --> 19:00.840]  IED or and you know maybe your legs are blown off in some of the cases and they
[19:00.840 --> 19:05.440]  come in and they go hello mr. Jones hello mr. Sanchez we don't want any
[19:05.440 --> 19:09.760]  trouble but it's been designated now with your medical records that you're
[19:09.760 --> 19:13.920]  disabled you can't have your gun and they said in Bloomberg and in the
[19:13.920 --> 19:17.480]  Associated Press and in all the articles that were out yesterday they said
[19:17.480 --> 19:20.880]  we're modeling this if I could just pull those out of the stack thank you
[19:20.880 --> 19:28.200]  in the LA Times too we're modeling this after the VA how they decide whether a
[19:28.200 --> 19:34.360]  veteran can have a gun or not so the gun confiscation has begun by stealth it's
[19:34.360 --> 19:40.160]  just out in the open but don't worry the original El Chapo Caitlyn Jenner gets a
[19:40.160 --> 19:44.200]  courage award because he got his hair done and wears a dress he didn't even
[19:44.200 --> 19:47.800]  he isn't even the real El Chapo he didn't even have it removed I mean

[24:34.640 --> 24:40.240]  too much I can throw a rod or blow the engine I am just completely overwhelmed
[24:40.240 --> 24:45.640]  with news I don't even know how to cover all this there's a new video that MSNBC
[24:45.640 --> 24:51.840]  is defending of another Planned Parenthood ghoul
[24:53.120 --> 24:58.080]  talking about how they haggle about the prices for harvesting organs from the
[24:58.080 --> 25:08.920]  babies they kill and it just makes me so sick to see these people that call
[25:08.920 --> 25:17.720]  themselves the left being so evil and so parasitic and they even look like
[25:17.720 --> 25:25.640]  villains from movies and then I see the Republican leadership working with them
[25:28.160 --> 25:32.920]  and you hear I'm talking about low balling on the body parts and how to
[25:32.920 --> 25:37.520]  get the prices down or how to sell them for more it physically turns your stomach
[25:37.520 --> 25:41.600]  as they run around saying we have the moral high ground we have the moral
[25:41.600 --> 25:46.760]  high ground we are your God do as we say your kids belong to us when they're
[25:46.760 --> 25:52.800]  clearly predators and they know their predators I remember with Mike Hansen
[25:52.800 --> 25:56.400]  he's got two or three of the TV reports and then we dug through the archives and
[25:56.400 --> 26:00.080]  could never find it I interviewed Michael Dell he was there interviewed all
[26:00.080 --> 26:04.480]  these former Dallas Cowboys they had a smart growth conference in Austin in
[26:04.480 --> 26:10.120]  like 1997 and I went to it at the Austin Convention Center they just finished it
[26:10.120 --> 26:14.640]  and I went in there and they let me in and I would go you're taking people's
[26:14.640 --> 26:18.280]  property and turning around and selling it for a profit it's not even for the
[26:18.280 --> 26:22.720]  earth you're stealing property and they would go get out of my way and yet of
[26:22.720 --> 26:33.680]  course we are and I walked up to this famous Dallas Cowboy and I I said yes
[26:33.680 --> 26:36.560]  I was just watching the conference you admit it's a big business and Bank of
[26:36.560 --> 26:40.840]  America's here he goes get out of my way to shove me out of the way as soon as
[26:40.840 --> 26:44.800]  you heard what I was saying and and they would look at me and go of course we
[26:44.800 --> 26:50.880]  are and it was just so predatory it's like in a Disney movie or something where
[26:50.880 --> 26:54.120]  you're at the bad guys hideout and the criminals are standing around with the
[26:54.120 --> 26:58.080]  robbed loot they're going this is really good oh yeah put that little one in the
[26:58.080 --> 27:08.880]  dungeon yeah I mean that's like Skexies out of the Dark Crystal when I was
[27:08.880 --> 27:12.000]  growing up around my family that were really nice loving good hard-working
[27:12.000 --> 27:16.560]  people I thought when I went and saw archetypes in movies of corrupt
[27:16.560 --> 27:21.960]  gangsters or of serial killers or of whatever the case was that that was
[27:21.960 --> 27:27.960]  Hollywood overdoing it until I met real New York Mafia and they act just like
[27:27.960 --> 27:32.200]  that I'm not saying they're the ultimate evil I'm just saying they really act
[27:32.200 --> 27:36.840]  over-the-top and you know the the fake crying and all of it and the oil is so
[27:36.840 --> 27:43.840]  much oil and then meanwhile you get around really wicked people the Mafia
[27:43.840 --> 27:51.120]  is like angels compared to them on average and they're like oh yes I mean
[27:51.120 --> 27:55.560]  you just cannot understand the evil we're dealing with I mean I know you do
[27:55.560 --> 28:02.640]  it's just just this new video makes me so angry I can't stand to even play it
[28:02.640 --> 28:06.880]  because I think I'll start smashing things I've kind of reached the point
[28:06.880 --> 28:10.880]  where I can't put up with it anymore we got borders wide open they're bringing
[28:10.880 --> 28:15.480]  radical Islamists to stand allowing them to recruit allowing them to gear up and
[28:15.480 --> 28:21.080]  when they start having terror attacks our freedoms will be taken and they
[28:21.080 --> 28:25.720]  admit the Homeland Security gear up is for the Patriots
[28:28.640 --> 28:32.720]  and then I think about how they have thousands of pharmacological crops
[28:32.720 --> 28:41.720]  growing open air that grow everything from live AIDS virus to chemicals yes
[28:41.720 --> 28:45.840]  you can program corn to grow basically anything you want and that stuff's
[28:45.840 --> 28:49.440]  jumping into other crops and spreading and all these new mystery diseases are
[28:49.440 --> 28:53.240]  spreading and neurological disorders are spreading and if you look at the graph
[28:53.240 --> 28:59.680]  within another 15 years basically 80% of people will have cancer 77% of people
[28:59.680 --> 29:03.040]  have neurological disorders there's just gonna be people flopping around having
[29:03.040 --> 29:06.920]  seizures and dying of cancer everywhere already you go to a grocery store or a
[29:06.920 --> 29:12.920]  mall and half the kids look like they've been shot with a mutation gun I mean I
[29:12.920 --> 29:17.520]  guess it is biblical I guess it's the mass plagues and then no one even cares
[29:17.520 --> 29:22.840]  because everything is being lectured by Caitlyn Jenner in a giant publicity
[29:22.840 --> 29:29.720]  stunt for reality TV I mean what a fantastic world where world governments
[29:29.720 --> 29:34.680]  here they put fluoride in the water GMOs mutating everything and then we're
[29:34.680 --> 29:39.600]  obsessed with a guy in a dress I mean it's just it's just it's it's it's
[29:39.600 --> 29:45.920]  Freakazoid it's Twilight Zone it's like the whole world's on PCP and if you're
[29:45.920 --> 29:52.400]  saying they say you're insane we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex
[29:52.400 --> 29:56.800]  Jones and the GCN radio network
[29:58.080 --> 30:04.160]  do you feel depressed have you recently lost a job or a girlfriend well
[30:04.160 --> 30:08.600]  according to Wesley Clark then you're ripe for radicalization that's right
[30:08.600 --> 30:12.760]  not content with the Fed saying that pain with cash was a sign of potential
[30:12.760 --> 30:16.840]  terrorism Clark has doubled down and suggests that the aforementioned people
[30:16.840 --> 30:21.560]  should be locked away in internment camps well we've got to identify the
[30:21.560 --> 30:26.240]  people who are most likely to be radicalized there are always a certain
[30:26.240 --> 30:29.560]  number of young people who are alienated they don't get a job they lost a
[30:29.560 --> 30:34.120]  girlfriend their family doesn't feel happy here if someone supported Nazi
[30:34.120 --> 30:38.000]  Germany at the expense of the United States we didn't say that was freedom of
[30:38.000 --> 30:43.960]  speech yeah we put him in a camp we they were prisoners of war so if these
[30:43.960 --> 30:47.880]  people are radicalized and they don't support the United States and they're
[30:47.880 --> 30:52.680]  disloyal to the United States it's our right and our obligation to segregate
[30:52.680 --> 30:58.280]  them from the normal community you can find more reports on info wars.com

[33:54.960 --> 34:01.160]  body parts jokes about buying a Lamborghini with the profits now again
[34:01.160 --> 34:05.800]  the way to shut this down is to have folks to open an open market for the
[34:05.800 --> 34:13.080]  body parts and then it'll drive up prices and I love the fact that what
[34:13.080 --> 34:17.920]  Sean Davis points out in the Twitter if you wrote a horror script where an
[34:17.920 --> 34:23.720]  abortionist haggle over baby body parts prices over wine and Lamborghini talk

[35:29.760 --> 35:38.320]  it's just it's crazy these people are demons they just appear it's start
[35:38.320 --> 35:42.320]  crawling out of trash cans one guy ran and hid in the dumpster I mean they're
[35:42.320 --> 35:47.320]  like demons and when you confront them they'll actually just basically roll
[35:47.320 --> 35:53.680]  around on the ground like in Christ time saying we are legion you are legion
[35:53.680 --> 36:00.960]  I'm sick of you oh it's like wearing the glasses folks I'm telling you it's like
[36:00.960 --> 36:05.520]  they live that maybe I should just settle down and play that six minute piece
[36:05.520 --> 36:09.080]  of McBrain put together from they live and we had Rowdy Piper on because you
[36:09.080 --> 36:13.120]  know I feel like Rowdy Piper we trying to get his buddy to put the glasses on he
[36:13.120 --> 36:18.360]  won't do it he goes put these glasses on or start eating concrete man I mean
[36:18.360 --> 36:27.640]  once you see it there's no going back just take the red pill people do you
[36:27.640 --> 36:34.120]  really want to side with ghoul women over 200 bottle red wine talking about
[36:34.120 --> 36:39.920]  Lamborghinis and but baby from baby part sales I mean do you really want
[36:39.920 --> 36:48.120]  that on your conscience I don't even know like to show at this point I just
[36:48.120 --> 36:53.960]  you know why don't like it when the cops pull me over and give me a ticket it's
[36:53.960 --> 36:56.240]  not that I'm mad they're giving me a ticket for speeding I shouldn't be
[36:56.240 --> 37:00.120]  speeding it's dangerous it's not good I get we got to have small in order it's
[37:00.120 --> 37:03.840]  that they'll be sure reason you were speeding ten miles over the speed
[37:03.840 --> 37:08.000]  limit like is there a reason you're not arresting people selling baby parts is
[37:08.000 --> 37:13.240]  there a reason everything's so high and mighty whenever it's just the hypocrisy
[37:13.240 --> 37:18.640]  of it whenever Donald Trump says McCain's no hero when it's been in mainstream
[37:18.640 --> 37:23.680]  news that he blew up the deck of a ship and got away with it and was a trustee
[37:23.680 --> 37:28.960]  at the Hanoi Hilton and is an and and help cover up the missing MIAs and is a
[37:28.960 --> 37:35.440]  total piece of crap but so what if Trump said something about veterans that was
[37:35.440 --> 37:39.080]  bad which he didn't he actually supports and I'm not defending Trump overall but
[37:39.080 --> 37:45.600]  he supports treating people at the VA not having death list so see really
[37:45.600 --> 37:51.840]  supporting troops you you get attacked really supporting him get attacked and
[37:51.840 --> 37:55.480]  then the veterans groups can weigh in and the Republican leadership and go the
[37:55.480 --> 37:58.360]  very Republican leadership going along with putting the troops on don't treat
[37:58.360 --> 38:03.120]  list can go you don't care about our veterans you have attacked all veterans
[38:03.120 --> 38:08.480]  and then the veterans groups bought and paid for go that's right you have
[38:08.480 --> 38:14.280]  attacked all veterans no he attacked John McCain same way he said a bunch of
[38:14.280 --> 38:18.280]  these illegals coming in are criminals he didn't say Mexicans were criminals he
[38:18.280 --> 38:22.360]  said a bunch of the illegals coming in are fleeing justice and are not good
[38:22.360 --> 38:28.240]  immigrants Mexico's collapsed of course he's telling the truth that's
[38:28.240 --> 38:33.600]  indisputable but they change it to Donald Trump doesn't like Mexicans and
[38:33.600 --> 38:38.640]  says they're lazy criminals never said that you go to the actual species said
[38:38.640 --> 38:41.760]  a lot of people from Latin America are hard-working good Christian people that
[38:41.760 --> 38:45.840]  I'd like to hire but a lot of them now are criminals and we need to stop them so
[38:45.840 --> 38:52.240]  they turn that around it's the same deal and then they can have a bunch of ghouls
[38:53.520 --> 38:58.960]  sitting around in every video drinking expensive wine in fancy restaurants
[38:58.960 --> 39:04.400]  talking about Lamborghinis and man I'm telling you folks I've been around them
[39:04.400 --> 39:09.360]  I even have it on video now they will come over and in a Linda Blair voice go
[39:09.360 --> 39:15.360]  nobody wants the black people like whoa what was that right we'll kill you
[39:15.360 --> 39:19.800]  someday right I mean number one time I was down there protesting the Fortune
[39:19.800 --> 39:23.800]  500 and all the communists were down there that a fortune 100 meeting at the
[39:23.800 --> 39:27.880]  four seasons and they can be said we're going to kill you someday and they're
[39:27.880 --> 39:34.040]  not trying to talk like demons they are this little red bearded Papa Smurf like
[39:34.040 --> 39:40.000]  guy with these other people and they're just they're just weak soulless vessels
[39:40.000 --> 39:45.080]  that I guess the lowest common denominator demon jumps into I guess
[39:45.080 --> 39:50.200]  they jump into pigs you know like Christ said and I guess that's what it's really
[39:50.200 --> 39:54.640]  coming down to whatever it is metaphysical galactic energy wavelengths
[39:54.640 --> 40:00.040]  group consciousness I don't know but it's always trendy women lisping driving
[40:00.040 --> 40:05.480]  brand new Mercedes drinking 200 bottle red wine talking and smacking and going
[40:05.480 --> 40:10.240]  let me try not to chop them up in too big a piece is gonna get all the goodies
[40:10.240 --> 40:19.320]  I'm just kind of thrusting around yeah yeah like their Amy Winehouse singing
[40:19.320 --> 40:25.960]  some some blues jazz riff but you're not on stage turning on a bunch of men you're
[40:25.960 --> 40:31.480]  a sick freak talking about baby parts it's not like you're in front of your
[40:31.480 --> 40:35.320]  husband in the bedroom you're talking about dead body parts and they're just
[40:35.320 --> 40:44.560]  wiggling around in their chair I can't handle it anymore I'm about to throw up
[40:44.560 --> 40:49.720]  actually said throw up my throat I want away from these people I don't like them
[40:49.720 --> 40:54.760]  they say our kids belong to them you understand they're coming they're coming

[41:06.160 --> 41:11.120]  you'll know it's a lowball sitting around like their horse traders talking
[41:11.120 --> 41:16.720]  about babies and the women come in it's not a child don't worry dear you paid

[41:34.280 --> 41:50.640]  I love you and these are the people lecturing everybody excuse me
[41:55.200 --> 41:58.760]  the second sting video has been released showing a Planned Parenthood
[41:58.760 --> 42:03.280]  official haggling over the price of aborted baby tissue and body parts
[42:03.280 --> 42:08.080]  during the gruesome conversation medical director council president Dr. Mary
[42:08.080 --> 42:14.400]  Gator even jokes that she wishes to buy a Lamborghini with the profits yeah as
[42:14.400 --> 42:19.320]  if you'll ever be able to use it or be happy you demon look at those eyes she's
[42:19.320 --> 42:24.400]  got those shark eyes they always do and Sean Davis says he wrote a horror
[42:24.400 --> 42:30.480]  script with abortionist haggle over baby parts prices one wine over wine and
[42:30.480 --> 42:34.280]  Lamborghini I can't even read I'm so angry excuse me if you wrote a horror
[42:34.280 --> 42:39.120]  script where abortionist haggle over baby parts prices over wine and Lamborghini
[42:39.120 --> 42:42.920]  talk nobody would believe it exactly
[42:46.360 --> 42:51.720]  yeah let's go ahead and play the piece with the folks haggling over the dead
[42:51.720 --> 42:55.400]  baby parts and the Lamborghinis and the red wine and all the rest of it here it
[42:55.400 --> 43:00.320]  is hello I'm Cecil Richards president of Planned Parenthood Federation of
[43:00.320 --> 43:06.080]  America I want to be really clear the allegation that Planned Parenthood
[43:06.080 --> 43:14.280]  profits in any way from tissue donation is not true the footage you're about to
[43:14.280 --> 43:16.840]  see was taken from an undercover meeting with top-level Planned Parenthood
[43:16.840 --> 43:20.680]  abortion doctor executive some viewers may find this disturbing what would you
[43:20.680 --> 43:37.720]  expect for intact tissue what what sort of compensation what sort of it shall be
[43:37.720 --> 43:40.480]  unlawful for any person knowingly to acquire or see where otherwise transfer
[43:40.480 --> 43:51.160]  any human fetal tissue for valuable consideration hit pause that's US code
[43:51.160 --> 43:56.720]  now expanding on this before I play more you just saw the head of Planned
[43:56.720 --> 44:02.600]  Parenthood sit there obviously lying I mean it been caught we know it notice her
[44:02.600 --> 44:09.760]  spin we don't sell or we're not profiting from fetal tissue donation so
[44:09.760 --> 44:13.080]  now it's a donation now they go oh yeah we're doing something with your dead
[44:13.080 --> 44:19.560]  baby parts it's a donation thank you for your organ harvesting donation and of
[44:19.560 --> 44:24.560]  course they're not making a profit because they're non-profit the Lamborghinis
[44:24.560 --> 44:29.880]  and the helicopters and the and the fancy dinners every day and the lunches
[44:29.880 --> 44:40.320]  haggling over the goods that are melted down into cosmetics and everything else
[44:40.320 --> 44:42.760]  that's all part of the non-profit and then the people are paid by the non-profit
[44:42.760 --> 44:49.000]  for profit so it's all legal twisting with mr. Maddow and others defending it
[44:49.000 --> 44:52.480]  you know Rachel Maddow has attacked me now I'm told I've only seen it twice three
[44:52.480 --> 44:57.080]  times for selling high-quality nutraceuticals at affordable prices
[44:57.080 --> 45:01.520]  that funder operation when GNC does it Whole Foods that's okay when we sell
[45:01.520 --> 45:07.200]  high-quality products we're snakehole salesmen but when you defend baby part
[45:07.200 --> 45:12.600]  selling it's trendy and it's liberal because you're the moral high ground
[45:12.600 --> 45:17.160]  you're a woman with a short haircut like this lady and if a woman has a short
[45:17.160 --> 45:22.960]  haircut it means she's smarter than you she's more moral than you no matter what
[45:22.960 --> 45:30.920]  she does she's the boss learn it on February 6 2015 investigators posing as
[45:30.920 --> 45:34.920]  fetal tissue procurement company met with the president of the Planned Parenthood
[45:34.920 --> 45:43.360]  Medical Directors Council that's the head of the council Dr. Mary Gatta now
[45:43.360 --> 45:48.880]  let's go to the tape we'll be exhibiting at the medical directors
[45:48.880 --> 45:57.720]  meeting in a couple of weeks I don't know if you'll be attending she's the
[45:57.720 --> 46:07.480]  president and liberal and liberal I'm liberal I rule so we had just started
[46:07.480 --> 46:10.720]  the conversation this is where the point there are startup that they have been
[46:10.720 --> 46:14.200]  about a year in business there are no proper company that's connecting new
[46:14.200 --> 46:18.520]  surfers with people who don't make tissue our volume thank you for giving it to me
[46:18.520 --> 46:22.320]  is a hundred a year with 60 in the second trimester and we're just starting to talk
[46:22.320 --> 46:27.000]  about how the process with no genics down in Los Angeles when I was there okay
[46:27.000 --> 46:32.000]  to back up a little bit PPFA our parent body is on boil it's a donation but we
[46:32.000 --> 46:35.640]  have to ask for a waiver to do it and we have to lay out for them or our
[46:35.640 --> 46:40.280]  programs going to be liked and the mechanics of it was that Heather
[46:40.280 --> 46:44.320]  know the genics person would come to the site and our staff would sign the
[46:44.320 --> 46:48.400]  patients up and get consent of my head we would look at the tissue and take what
[46:48.400 --> 46:56.320]  you required so this conversation for this
[46:56.320 --> 47:02.440]  conversation for this discussion as I was leaving they have been paying by the
[47:02.440 --> 47:06.920]  case and there's some discussion about doing it in a different way or I don't
[47:06.920 --> 47:12.920]  suppose this audio probably doesn't translate too well over am radio a lot
[47:12.920 --> 47:16.200]  of our stations are am affiliates anybody who wants to go to infowars.com
[47:16.200 --> 47:20.000]  and see the video and it's very clear to hear what she says and there's close
[47:20.000 --> 47:23.000]  caption we're gonna go back to more in a moment because I want to put this on
[47:23.000 --> 47:30.440]  record but notice now because there's heat on this the last few years with the
[47:30.440 --> 47:34.080]  pro-life group saying it's happening first they go it's insane it's not
[47:34.080 --> 47:38.640]  happening MSNBC and CNN say so and we're women with short haircuts you do what
[47:38.640 --> 47:43.600]  we say Janet Reno burned down Waco but she had a short haircut so it's okay and
[47:43.600 --> 47:51.440]  then now they're like you got to give them a sign the forms and you know you
[47:51.440 --> 47:56.760]  get more money the bigger the baby is and she goes over giving the woman $200
[47:56.760 --> 48:01.480]  $400 in her dollars oh you're but you waited till seven months we're gonna
[48:01.480 --> 48:04.880]  bring in a special medical team and you're gonna get a couple thousand
[48:04.880 --> 48:08.920]  dollars sweetie what we're not gonna tell you is we're gonna get hundreds of
[48:08.920 --> 48:13.400]  thousands because we can get full size and then they it's come out at other
[48:13.400 --> 48:18.120]  abortions around the country they keep that baby alive they don't suck its
[48:18.120 --> 48:23.720]  brains out they get it out and then they got it right there make sure all those
[48:23.720 --> 48:28.280]  organs are kept in proper perspective so they can be gotten out quickly now
[48:28.280 --> 48:31.160]  people like this doctor who's on there who's on the council they like to keep
[48:31.160 --> 48:34.600]  their hands clean so you know she probably don't even know all the stuff
[48:34.600 --> 48:38.160]  that's going on that's how compartmentalized this is but that's what we
[48:38.160 --> 48:41.400]  know from China and other countries where this goes on you can go read
[48:41.400 --> 48:46.520]  snopes snopes last time I checked it's a woman with a cat she's a woman with a
[48:46.520 --> 48:51.200]  cat in an apartment so she says what's real and what's not China doesn't sell
[48:51.200 --> 48:59.280]  organs and again Bill Clinton's not a liar either but before they do the
[48:59.280 --> 49:06.120]  vivisection on your baby there's a lot of money involved human vivisection has
[49:06.120 --> 49:12.520]  been listed as a form of torture but hey if it's for a baby why not have a
[49:12.520 --> 49:16.880]  woman with a short haircut says it's okay you know it is because there are
[49:16.880 --> 49:27.840]  bosses let's go back okay so I'd like what what would what would you expect
[49:27.840 --> 49:41.400]  for intact tissue what what sort of compensation what sort of okay I don't
[49:41.400 --> 49:45.440]  think so I'd like to I would like to know here's the haggling what would make
[49:45.440 --> 49:48.360]  you happy it would work for you I'm gonna skip the work break but no more
[49:48.360 --> 49:52.160]  today I'm but I'm getting too upset I just can't even play ads anymore when
[49:52.160 --> 49:57.800]  this is going on the reason I'm getting so angry is I'm angry I can barely go
[49:57.800 --> 50:02.040]  there right now because I'm watching the video of her with this vampire look if
[50:02.040 --> 50:05.040]  I was scripting for a female evil vampire in a movie like a head female
[50:05.040 --> 50:09.800]  vampire she'd be it her lips come back like some type of reptiles or something
[50:09.800 --> 50:13.440]  mechanically away from the teeth and the tongue comes out when she talks about
[50:13.440 --> 50:17.440]  baby parts well first why don't you tell me what she's saying I mean she's just
[50:17.440 --> 50:28.960]  sitting there salivating over all the profits and just looks like evil incarnate
[50:28.960 --> 50:33.720]  oh I just if I gave you my real ammo on these people I know exactly what they're
[50:33.720 --> 50:38.200]  up to oh my god I just know too much like Norris Barkley says I'm not crazy
[50:38.200 --> 50:46.080]  cuz I didn't know enough I know too much I mean these people Joseph Mingola did
[50:46.080 --> 50:51.720]  stuff like this and he's known as the angel of death and this is the angel of
[50:51.720 --> 50:57.600]  death flying free but can we go out to break the last minute of this hour with
[50:57.600 --> 51:04.680]  the angel of death place okay I don't think so I'd like to I would like to
[51:04.680 --> 51:18.920]  know what would make you happy what would work for you no I don't look at it
[51:18.920 --> 51:28.360]  that way I know you want to play that game I get it you know what if you
[51:28.360 --> 51:32.080]  low ball all all act pleasantly surprised and you'll know it's a low ball
[51:32.080 --> 51:37.840]  okay what I want to know is what would what would you back it up a minute I
[51:37.840 --> 51:43.160]  want to play all this again we'll give you all our supplies see dead babies
[51:43.160 --> 51:48.160]  dehumanizing us with supplies you notice in work and in the West under
[51:48.160 --> 51:56.120]  UNESCO rules human labor is called human resources it's all in your face with
[51:56.120 --> 52:03.160]  these ghouls who are weak who are evil but are willing and able to manipulate
[52:03.160 --> 52:08.240]  many women that have hearts I mean I've got a bleeding heart people I love
[52:08.240 --> 52:14.600]  innocence I love people of every human derivation I love honor I love strength
[52:14.600 --> 52:21.240]  I love dignity and I sit here watching humans torn apart all around me their
[52:21.240 --> 52:25.400]  minds torn apart their futures torn apart victims of political correctness
[52:25.400 --> 52:30.440]  that is a science to destabilize the human community for globalist
[52:30.440 --> 52:36.360]  dismantlement and rendering down into a suboid slave class and they have White
[52:36.360 --> 52:40.160]  House run publications when I talk about this put out transcripts and make
[52:40.160 --> 52:46.760]  jokes this isn't a joke fool you're drinking fluoride you're eating GMO
[52:46.760 --> 52:52.240]  you're gonna die a horribly excruciating death your children probably are the
[52:52.240 --> 52:59.040]  time of judgments coming from your own system God judges us just letting us be
[52:59.040 --> 53:04.120]  under you and none of your evil friends are gonna come see you when you're
[53:04.120 --> 53:10.080]  dying of cancer in the hospital I mean don't you have any common sense what is
[53:10.080 --> 53:14.080]  superstition it's God's fearing people that are heathen don't have a
[53:14.080 --> 53:17.360]  relationship with God or the universe but they still feel it and feel like they
[53:17.360 --> 53:21.160]  should be worried about what they're up to and you people have no connection to
[53:21.160 --> 53:25.360]  God no connection to common sense no connection to empathy that's why you

[01:00:08.360 --> 01:00:15.960]  cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio
[01:00:15.960 --> 01:00:22.880]  network and now live from Austin, Texas Alex Jones
[01:00:32.600 --> 01:00:39.440]  the haggling over the dead babies and their giblets sounds like they're
[01:00:39.440 --> 01:00:45.320]  arguing over chicken gizzards or something and they sit there you know
[01:00:45.320 --> 01:00:52.880]  just really getting off on the haggling it's up on infowars.com it's been
[01:00:52.880 --> 01:00:55.920]  years since I've talked about compensation so let me just figure out
[01:00:55.920 --> 01:01:00.040]  what others are getting and if this is the ballpark and it's fine if it's
[01:01:00.040 --> 01:01:03.800]  still low then we can bump it up Gatter says the head of Palin Parenthood's
[01:01:03.800 --> 01:01:20.080]  Council adding that I want a Lamborghini while cackling with laughter and just
[01:01:20.080 --> 01:01:25.160]  the animal in me I mean a raccoon if you try to kill its babies I don't care
[01:01:25.160 --> 01:01:28.280]  if it's the toughest pit bull that raccoon is gonna jump on its back hold
[01:01:28.280 --> 01:01:32.600]  on to its ears and start chewing its eyeballs out I mean raccoons will drown
[01:01:32.600 --> 01:01:38.520]  bloodhounds and coon dogs they will get on top of them and push them into the
[01:01:38.520 --> 01:01:45.680]  water and they weigh maybe 10% of the dog a rat if you're trying to grab it and
[01:01:45.680 --> 01:01:52.240]  kill it will bite you this is an info war will we stand up for our young will
[01:01:52.240 --> 01:02:01.240]  we stand up for in history three things are honored children women and warriors
[01:02:01.240 --> 01:02:07.440]  and of course the witch doctors the scientists they're honored as well but
[01:02:07.440 --> 01:02:13.000]  the greatest honored are children women and warriors so they use this in a warrior
[01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:16.160]  honor because back in the old tribal days you know your wars would go off and
[01:02:16.160 --> 01:02:19.160]  fight and die for the tribe and then these are the they were gonna go fight
[01:02:19.160 --> 01:02:23.440]  some vicious men they're gonna come and conquer and enslave and basically kill
[01:02:23.440 --> 01:02:27.840]  the older women the men and just take the children away that's how many
[01:02:27.840 --> 01:02:32.240]  cultures worked and so the warriors were honored because they were going to
[01:02:32.240 --> 01:02:38.520]  protect you and now we just put them on death list and don't give them treatment
[01:02:38.520 --> 01:02:43.560]  it's it's the very same thing and it's because more and more our economy is
[01:02:43.560 --> 01:02:47.040]  geared by the mega banks and not to produce we could produce so much wealth
[01:02:47.040 --> 01:02:50.600]  the globalists admit this that it's unlimited they argue that's bad for the
[01:02:50.600 --> 01:02:54.920]  earth whatever they could do it in innovative ways they want a frozen
[01:02:54.920 --> 01:02:58.360]  feudal system
[01:03:01.240 --> 01:03:05.720]  where there's very limited resources and so they can control you with those
[01:03:05.720 --> 01:03:09.280]  limited resources and basically buy your daughter for ten dollars she's gonna
[01:03:09.280 --> 01:03:13.640]  starve to death if she doesn't they don't want you independent and notice
[01:03:13.640 --> 01:03:17.920]  they sell the feminism as about making women independent all it does is make
[01:03:17.920 --> 01:03:23.600]  women alone working two three jobs turned into total sex objects and the
[01:03:23.600 --> 01:03:28.720]  family broke down and their kids belonging to the state every metric
[01:03:28.720 --> 01:03:34.920]  shows women are devastated other than professional women who then have the
[01:03:34.920 --> 01:03:39.680]  house husband who takes care of the kids and then she goes and fools around on
[01:03:39.680 --> 01:03:44.880]  him and the man says I am now miserable taking care of my children and being at
[01:03:44.880 --> 01:03:47.880]  home I know what it is to be a feminist that was in the New York magazine Paul
[01:03:47.880 --> 01:03:51.480]  Watson did a piece on it are you kidding it would be wonderful to be home with my
[01:03:51.480 --> 01:03:55.400]  children wonderful to keep the house clean wonderful to do all that stuff I
[01:03:55.400 --> 01:04:00.120]  mean they're implying that that isn't fulfilling I love being home at night or
[01:04:00.120 --> 01:04:05.840]  on the weekend and taking care of my kids I love it it's so much better than
[01:04:05.840 --> 01:04:10.320]  what men have historically had to do going out and put it on the line in the
[01:04:10.320 --> 01:04:16.200]  factories and in the fields and in the I mean my grandmother's especially my
[01:04:16.200 --> 01:04:20.440]  dad's mother was looking these beautiful sundresses and 50 style dresses
[01:04:20.440 --> 01:04:24.400]  school teacher working hard taking care at the house my grandfather cuts all
[01:04:24.400 --> 01:04:29.800]  over him out there running combines out there you know doing construction on the
[01:04:29.800 --> 01:04:34.280]  side pouring concrete working on highway crews and they own land and were
[01:04:34.280 --> 01:04:38.840]  upper middle class but working from sun up to sundown and then there was his
[01:04:38.840 --> 01:04:46.320]  wife up there on a pedestal absolutely empowered beautiful and strong they
[01:04:46.320 --> 01:04:51.480]  have inverted that completely when you take down men you take down the whole
[01:04:51.480 --> 01:04:56.280]  society and they've done it they're a boarding humanity they are ghouls they
[01:04:56.280 --> 01:05:01.280]  are enemies here is an update on the Chattanooga shooting over the weekend
[01:05:01.280 --> 01:05:06.000]  one of the victims died of his injuries and now the death toll is six including
[01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:09.800]  the shooter and the FBI is telling people not to jump to conclusions and that
[01:05:09.800 --> 01:05:12.720]  the shooter may not have had terrorist ties but may have suffered from
[01:05:12.720 --> 01:05:16.280]  depression so here we have another potential mass murder suicide pill
[01:05:16.280 --> 01:05:20.480]  incident thanks big pharma of course mr. Abdulzee's father was initially on a
[01:05:20.480 --> 01:05:24.760]  terror watch list and mr. Abdulzee's himself made some interesting trips to
[01:05:24.760 --> 01:05:28.520]  the Middle East over the last few years but don't look at any of that it's not
[01:05:28.520 --> 01:05:32.440]  a terrorist attack this can only be considered an isolated incident but
[01:05:32.440 --> 01:05:35.960]  that didn't stop general Wesley Clark calling for internment camps for
[01:05:35.960 --> 01:05:40.240]  disloyal Americans over the weekend the retired general told MSNBC in World
[01:05:40.240 --> 01:05:43.200]  War two if someone supported Nazi Germany at the expense of the United
[01:05:43.200 --> 01:05:46.720]  States we didn't say that was freedom of speech we put him in a camp they were
[01:05:46.720 --> 01:05:50.200]  prisoners of war Clark's remarks reveal the mindset of the upper echelon of
[01:05:50.200 --> 01:05:53.480]  government those who disagree with our so-called leaders are now to be rounded

[01:08:32.640 --> 01:08:38.780]  aborted baby parts and organs meanwhile MSNBC is shilling for Planned

[01:08:51.540 --> 01:08:55.900]  and to bring the nation down into a one-world government absolutely on

[01:09:24.180 --> 01:09:27.260]  lipstick on she'd rather have a bag on her head I guess and live in a slave
[01:09:27.260 --> 01:09:34.380]  dungeon or she wouldn't she just gets off on the degeneracy the aberrance of
[01:09:34.380 --> 01:09:38.700]  supporting horrible killers that hate the West because the spoiled rotten pigs
[01:09:38.700 --> 01:09:44.620]  that sit in the West living off of it all they can do is crap all over it all
[01:09:44.620 --> 01:09:48.260]  day because they have never lived in the real world I want to throw up
[01:09:48.260 --> 01:09:56.340]  Sweden's committing suicide like the rest of Europe Reverend Graham Billy Graham
[01:09:56.340 --> 01:10:00.500]  son the head of his coalition says we're under attack stop all immigration of
[01:10:00.500 --> 01:10:04.740]  Muslims the US and that's not a tongue-in-cheek satire piece he's serious
[01:10:04.740 --> 01:10:10.580]  so this is really escalating quickly so we have the Swedish immigration officer
[01:10:10.580 --> 01:10:15.340]  exposes a jihadist sympathizer we have the Reverend Graham coming out saying
[01:10:15.340 --> 01:10:18.980]  stop immigration of all Muslims of the country till something can be put in
[01:10:18.980 --> 01:10:22.980]  place to stop the radicalized ones coming in I just want to know why
[01:10:22.980 --> 01:10:31.580]  Homeland Security says the number one threat in America I want to know why
[01:10:31.580 --> 01:10:34.460]  the number one threat were told as gun owners returning veterans conservatives
[01:10:34.460 --> 01:10:38.780]  libertarians when they're doing nothing on the terrorism Richter scale doesn't
[01:10:38.780 --> 01:10:43.420]  even show up not even a blip and Islamic terror is blowing stuff up in France
[01:10:43.420 --> 01:10:47.340]  every couple days shooting up police departments blowing up Turkish
[01:10:47.340 --> 01:10:52.660]  facilities attacking all over Africa attacking all over Kuwait just just
[01:10:52.660 --> 01:10:57.220]  almost on a daily basis attacks in garland attacks on recruiting centers
[01:10:57.220 --> 01:11:04.620]  and it's oh it's not Islamic terror it's not radical terror yes it is now Joe
[01:11:04.620 --> 01:11:10.300]  Biggs this weekend and yesterday highly decorated Army veteran former staff
[01:11:10.300 --> 01:11:19.180]  sergeant in his own right is physically angry around the office just like I am
[01:11:19.180 --> 01:11:24.100]  about the fact that they're not allowing these recruiting centers to be armed I
[01:11:24.100 --> 01:11:28.500]  mean Biggs has a whole gun safe right there in his office right up by the
[01:11:28.500 --> 01:11:33.780]  front door and then so does every other office and it's not that we're gun nuts
[01:11:33.780 --> 01:11:37.220]  we're free we're exercising our birthright and we're not sitting ducks
[01:11:37.220 --> 01:11:42.220]  we're ready we're ready and that's why people I predict aren't going to be
[01:11:42.220 --> 01:11:48.540]  targeting this facility when we're here because we fight back and these colors
[01:11:48.540 --> 01:11:53.620]  don't run we represent the real America the pro-freedom pro-family pro-private
[01:11:53.620 --> 01:11:56.900]  property system that made us the greatest country in the world or everybody
[01:11:56.900 --> 01:12:02.500]  wanted to come here and so Joe Biggs went out there when he went out there and
[01:12:02.500 --> 01:12:05.940]  wasn't in his army uniform and wasn't armed the army recruiters and the other
[01:12:05.940 --> 01:12:09.780]  recruiters we're gonna say exactly who it's a joint service all four services
[01:12:09.780 --> 01:12:14.100]  there it's a large facility South Park Meadows wouldn't talk to him he went out
[01:12:14.100 --> 01:12:18.820]  there it stood guard for more than six hours yesterday in his army sergeant
[01:12:18.820 --> 01:12:23.580]  uniform with his M4
[01:12:23.700 --> 01:12:31.940]  truly protecting this Republic and they I don't want to give away too much they
[01:12:31.940 --> 01:12:36.440]  don't get in trouble but it's duty to disregard treasonous orders they
[01:12:36.440 --> 01:12:39.620]  called him in and he's going to recap what they told him the article is on
[01:12:39.620 --> 01:12:44.900]  info wars.com right now red linked exclusive military recruiting centers
[01:12:44.900 --> 01:12:53.420]  nationwide receive threats are receiving threats armed forces locations on alert
[01:12:53.420 --> 01:12:58.740]  after Chattanooga shooting and they are disarmed Florida Nevada Texas everything
[01:12:58.740 --> 01:13:03.860]  from death threats to we're gonna get you and believe me Biggs doesn't hype
[01:13:03.860 --> 01:13:11.300]  stuff up that isn't real he saw something very concerning yesterday and
[01:13:11.300 --> 01:13:15.780]  multiple tours in Iraq multiple tours in Afghanistan when he says it was an
[01:13:15.780 --> 01:13:19.780]  Arab man in a beat-up uniform that he believes was casing a facility I talked
[01:13:19.780 --> 01:13:23.820]  to him this morning I believe him and and and then again in San Marcos out of
[01:13:23.820 --> 01:13:27.980]  Austin they're getting bizarre calls threats people casing them there is
[01:13:27.980 --> 01:13:32.740]  undoubtedly a lot of people who are basically bots or fellow travelers with
[01:13:32.740 --> 01:13:37.380]  ISIS that are thinking because the media is hyping it up to sexy about hitting
[01:13:37.380 --> 01:13:40.820]  recruiting centers and Obama and the globalists are not going to be able to
[01:13:40.820 --> 01:13:43.380]  cover this up
[01:13:43.460 --> 01:13:48.380]  simply over the top so joining us is Joe Biggs Jakari Jackson's also out there
[01:13:48.380 --> 01:13:53.020]  investigating doing a fabulous job we'll talk to him after the break but Joe
[01:13:53.020 --> 01:13:57.140]  Biggs tell us where you are and break down for the radio and TV audience
[01:13:57.140 --> 01:14:03.060]  exactly what's unfolding so as you can see I'm standing in front of the
[01:14:03.060 --> 01:14:10.420]  rear and South Park and knows this is in South Austin right off of I-35 now I
[01:14:10.420 --> 01:14:13.700]  decided to come out here yesterday I was out here doing some reporting with
[01:14:13.700 --> 01:14:17.460]  Jakari Jackson and I saw a gentleman out here and you know and I was you know I
[01:14:17.460 --> 01:14:21.180]  thought to myself I need to be out here as well there's no way that one person
[01:14:21.180 --> 01:14:24.860]  should be sitting out here to do this themselves and I just felt obligated so
[01:14:24.860 --> 01:14:29.620]  I went home I grabbed my my vest my gun my kit and I came out here and sit guard
[01:14:29.620 --> 01:14:32.460]  until about 8 30 at night last night so I was out here for about six and a half
[01:14:32.460 --> 01:14:36.260]  hours I got home I was able to talk to some other people and get some more
[01:14:36.260 --> 01:14:39.740]  people organized so now we have some people this location up in Round Rock
[01:14:39.740 --> 01:14:46.100]  down in San Marcos possibly Midland San Antonio's throughout the state and I
[01:14:46.100 --> 01:14:48.620]  really want to get a lot of people throughout the country to come out and
[01:14:48.620 --> 01:14:52.500]  do this exact same thing because it's pretty pathetic that our own armed
[01:14:52.500 --> 01:14:56.540]  servicemen can't be armed when they're back here and yet we trust them to go
[01:14:56.540 --> 01:15:01.140]  overseas and fight for our country for these freedoms but they were returned
[01:15:01.140 --> 01:15:05.300]  sure your sky's breaking up a bit and we're gonna see if it stabilizes in a
[01:15:05.300 --> 01:15:08.180]  moment but I want to make a correction because I was going off what I was told
[01:15:08.180 --> 01:15:13.380]  by one of the other reporters by the news director that I thought you were in
[01:15:13.380 --> 01:15:17.100]  uniform out there you're just out there in a basic tactical outfit with a black
[01:15:17.100 --> 01:15:21.900]  t-shirt on in the Texas heat so we appreciate you doing that Joe and
[01:15:21.900 --> 01:15:25.700]  Jacarie now I understand why you went out there is they're not allowed to be
[01:15:25.700 --> 01:15:29.180]  armed you want to draw attention to it but the threats of the big news tell us
[01:15:29.180 --> 01:15:33.860]  exactly without giving away too much to get them in trouble repeat to me what you
[01:15:33.860 --> 01:15:38.940]  told myself and do so yesterday I was saying out here in front of the center
[01:15:38.940 --> 01:15:44.420]  and one of the higher-ranking individuals and armed services behind me came up and
[01:15:44.420 --> 01:15:49.700]  said that they got intel from higher-ups in that branch that locations in Las
[01:15:49.700 --> 01:15:54.380]  Vegas throughout Florida and the one in San Marcos had been receiving threats on
[01:15:54.380 --> 01:15:58.020]  the one in San Marcos was getting a lot of calls hangups was very odd this is
[01:15:58.020 --> 01:16:02.620]  that they've never had to happen before so that's something that's very very
[01:16:02.620 --> 01:16:06.900]  strange so we now know that they're active threats happening at different
[01:16:06.900 --> 01:16:10.460]  locations across the country there's no telling how many other locations are
[01:16:10.460 --> 01:16:15.420]  probably receiving similar threats now just a second ago before we went live I
[01:16:15.420 --> 01:16:20.500]  saw that a man had called in and said that he had planted a bomb at a Florida
[01:16:20.500 --> 01:16:24.860]  National Guard armor so that is something that's happening right now as
[01:16:24.860 --> 01:16:29.860]  well let's update call Watson's article that they're now bomb threats coming in
[01:16:29.860 --> 01:16:33.300]  so from what I heard from you the San Marcos thing is just creepy the other
[01:16:33.300 --> 01:16:36.740]  facilities are actually getting threats we're coming to get you things like that
[01:16:36.740 --> 01:16:41.860]  there's a lot of chatter on Twitter and Facebook specifically Joe what do you make
[01:16:41.860 --> 01:16:48.180]  of the fact that the media is still saying this is not Islamic I mean of
[01:16:48.180 --> 01:16:51.460]  course it is I mean this guy was continuously going overseas of the
[01:16:51.460 --> 01:16:55.660]  Middle East was radicalized at some point I mean you even look at his quote
[01:16:55.660 --> 01:17:00.340]  in the in his high school yearbook you know there's a numerous signs that
[01:17:00.340 --> 01:17:04.660]  something like this was going to happen and even a tweet coming by the ISIS
[01:17:04.660 --> 01:17:08.420]  accounts predicting that this would happen in about the day okay well just
[01:17:08.420 --> 01:17:13.300]  to show how credible we are you've been tweeting for a day that there are threats
[01:17:13.300 --> 01:17:16.860]  in Florida I've been covering it since the start of the show this just broke in
[01:17:16.860 --> 01:17:21.180]  the last few minutes indeed bomb threats men claiming bombs have been
[01:17:21.180 --> 01:17:26.820]  planted mainstream news will put it on screen in Florida so exactly confirming
[01:17:26.820 --> 01:17:31.380]  the type of threats that we were told about yesterday and again that's how to
[01:17:31.380 --> 01:17:37.260]  news 13 out of Orlando man says he planted a bomb at National Guard Armory
[01:17:37.260 --> 01:17:43.020]  in Florida so this is escalating Joe yeah exactly and the pathetic thing is
[01:17:43.020 --> 01:17:46.740]  though is our armed servicemen can't protect themselves here now a lot of
[01:17:46.740 --> 01:17:49.980]  governors have signed these bills allowing the National Guard to be able
[01:17:49.980 --> 01:17:53.060]  to protect themselves but they also have private security that stand guard
[01:17:53.060 --> 01:17:57.820]  around a gated fence at these facilities and in a facility like this you
[01:17:57.820 --> 01:18:01.580]  don't have a fence protecting it you don't have hired securities stand out
[01:18:01.580 --> 01:18:05.900]  here so it takes a group of patriots like over to my left men to come out here
[01:18:05.900 --> 01:18:10.260]  take time away from their job to come out here and stand guard so we need people
[01:18:10.260 --> 01:18:14.540]  across this country to rally together you know what America when something
[01:18:14.540 --> 01:18:19.860]  happens at tragedy Americans come together and that's what we do we fight
[01:18:19.860 --> 01:18:22.980]  for each other we stand up for each other that's what it's all about I'm not
[01:18:22.980 --> 01:18:26.700]  gonna sit around and let these guys have to come in and out of out of work and be
[01:18:26.700 --> 01:18:32.540]  fearful for their lives because of what happened well it's a treasonous order to
[01:18:32.540 --> 01:18:38.100]  say I mean I understand in the barracks or or you know at certain events yeah
[01:18:38.100 --> 01:18:42.100]  don't bring your guns don't bring your firearms but to say its soft targets
[01:18:42.100 --> 01:18:46.980]  out in the open that no one can be armed I mean at least the officers should be
[01:18:46.980 --> 01:18:50.540]  armed I mean that's it's been like that in every culture it's really unprecedented
[01:18:50.540 --> 01:18:55.100]  since Bill Clinton took the guns off the basis I mean this is a treasonous
[01:18:55.100 --> 01:18:59.340]  activity yeah exactly and this is something we need to change this is
[01:18:59.340 --> 01:19:03.860]  something we need to bring awareness to this needs to be changed not only do we
[01:19:03.860 --> 01:19:06.780]  need the National Guard to be able to protect themselves but these locations
[01:19:06.780 --> 01:19:10.220]  are spread throughout the country in very rural areas sometimes in the middle of
[01:19:10.220 --> 01:19:13.980]  the woods sometimes like right here this is a strip mall if something were to
[01:19:13.980 --> 01:19:17.660]  happen this is an opportune spot for someone to do something to get multiple
[01:19:17.660 --> 01:19:22.260]  people so we need to change that law we need to allow these men and women to
[01:19:22.260 --> 01:19:26.540]  sit in here trying to recruit more people to protect our country they have
[01:19:26.540 --> 01:19:29.860]  the same ability to protect themselves in combat as they do back here in the
[01:19:29.860 --> 01:19:34.340]  homeland sure and you know we can look at 9-11 and radical Islamists being
[01:19:34.340 --> 01:19:37.940]  protected and understand they're using these attacks to take our liberties no
[01:19:37.940 --> 01:19:41.980]  the answer is arm the American people so that no matter who's gonna try something
[01:19:41.980 --> 01:19:46.860]  the degenerate scumbag in South Carolina or the degenerate scumbags coming in
[01:19:46.860 --> 01:19:51.060]  wanting to kill people they just can't do it then we can reform our military and
[01:19:51.060 --> 01:19:54.580]  not have it be a tool of the globalist that's a separate debate from not
[01:19:54.580 --> 01:20:01.340]  giving the troops health care and allowing them to be sitting ducks we we

[01:25:38.300 --> 01:25:44.580]  heat in South Austin just wanted to get your take on this situation with him
[01:25:44.580 --> 01:25:49.460]  saying it's not Islamic chair now the threats coming in with a reported bomb
[01:25:49.460 --> 01:25:54.940]  in Florida hours after we first broke this what is your take on it Jacarie
[01:25:54.940 --> 01:25:59.420]  Jackson? Jacarie Jackson reporting from South Austin in front of the armed
[01:25:59.420 --> 01:26:02.980]  service armed services recruiting station yes I'm out here with Joe Biggs
[01:26:02.980 --> 01:26:06.540]  Alex and when we think about all the things that our fighting men and women
[01:26:06.540 --> 01:26:10.220]  go through and then we tell them that when they come back home they can't
[01:26:10.220 --> 01:26:14.780]  carry a firearm just like you and I both know Master Sergeant CJ Grisham US Army
[01:26:14.780 --> 01:26:19.020]  retired he was out walking with his son in the country they said in the country
[01:26:19.020 --> 01:26:22.100]  they said also pulled up so why do you have this gun he's like there's a bunch
[01:26:22.100 --> 01:26:25.340]  of wild game out here I need to be able to defend myself and then the guy says
[01:26:25.340 --> 01:26:28.580]  you're really displaying and takes him to jail and this is the things that we
[01:26:28.580 --> 01:26:32.060]  talk about the people go overseas to fight for these rights and then we rob
[01:26:32.060 --> 01:26:36.340]  them from them when they return to the US soil now a little bit ago about 30
[01:26:36.340 --> 01:26:40.380]  minutes ago before we went on camera here a lady came over with her two
[01:26:40.380 --> 01:26:44.060]  sons she didn't want to talk on camera but she came over she said son you see
[01:26:44.060 --> 01:26:47.540]  these guys out here this is what the second amendment it's all about it's
[01:26:47.540 --> 01:26:51.220]  about being able to defend yourself and defend others it's not people running
[01:26:51.220 --> 01:26:54.340]  around you know shooting guns in the air like they want you to believe Alex you
[01:26:54.340 --> 01:26:58.300]  and I have both been to countless open carry rallies I've never seen a single
[01:26:58.300 --> 01:27:03.660]  person shot no crime period and look at the sign behind you Jacari it says armed
[01:27:03.660 --> 01:27:09.940]  forces recruiting center armed armed yes that's a very good point but they're
[01:27:09.940 --> 01:27:14.980]  not our yes that's exactly right so this is the things that we want people to
[01:27:14.980 --> 01:27:18.300]  know when they talk about the armed services that you can't even be armed
[01:27:18.300 --> 01:27:21.180]  in one of these facilities and the guys will come up every now again and say
[01:27:21.180 --> 01:27:24.420]  hey thank you guys for being out here you know don't thank me I'm a civilian but
[01:27:24.420 --> 01:27:28.220]  they come out and shake my head I say no sir thank you and all the talk on the
[01:27:28.220 --> 01:27:31.060]  internet saying that info wars hates the military and all this stuff we don't
[01:27:31.060 --> 01:27:34.100]  hate the military we may question some of the orders that they're given like you
[01:27:34.100 --> 01:27:37.060]  know if they're disarming people in Hurricane Katrina we may hate that order
[01:27:37.060 --> 01:27:41.620]  that doesn't mean that it's the republics military we hate the treasonous orders
[01:27:41.620 --> 01:27:46.140]  coming down preparing them for tyrannical action we're fighting for the
[01:27:46.140 --> 01:27:49.860]  heart and soul of our military and we're fighting to get them the medical
[01:27:49.860 --> 01:27:53.540]  treatment they deserve not throwing them in the trash while using them to push
[01:27:53.540 --> 01:27:57.820]  the establishment agenda exactly right so we love our truth we support our
[01:27:57.820 --> 01:28:01.560]  truth we just don't support everything that they're told to do so with that in
[01:28:01.560 --> 01:28:04.780]  mind we said the least that we can do you know of course Joe Big Sur he's a
[01:28:04.780 --> 01:28:08.740]  combat veteran that's at least I do it's coming here you know my concealed carry
[01:28:08.740 --> 01:28:12.660]  got my custom-made holster from head down firearms thank you to those guys to
[01:28:12.660 --> 01:28:17.060]  be out here and be able to protect the troops just a little bit that I can that's
[01:28:17.060 --> 01:28:23.580]  right now I'm here with my 357 Magnum Smith and Wesson and the reason I have
[01:28:23.580 --> 01:28:26.860]  this is in a jam I don't have to think I don't have to load it I don't have to
[01:28:26.860 --> 01:28:31.540]  cock it it's just ready and I can shoot pretty much center of mass at about 80
[01:28:31.540 --> 01:28:36.020]  yards with this accurately and it's a seven-shot revolver and I got my M4
[01:28:36.020 --> 01:28:40.100]  right here that just so happens to be from hdfirearms.com one of our great
[01:28:40.100 --> 01:28:43.900]  sponsors helping support the broadcast but that's a completely you know
[01:28:43.900 --> 01:28:47.940]  different issue it comes down to the fact that we're aware this is going on
[01:28:47.940 --> 01:28:53.020]  we're sick of having our freedoms taken for imaginary patriot terror when we
[01:28:53.020 --> 01:28:59.380]  know the real terror threat in this country is not from domestic sources and
[01:28:59.380 --> 01:29:04.940]  if there is any terror attacks during Jade Helm expect it to be blamed on the
[01:29:04.940 --> 01:29:08.180]  liberty movement we're not just going to sit here and be set up anymore jacari
[01:29:08.180 --> 01:29:11.860]  yeah I'm just like you did the video a few years ago they say and you're a
[01:29:11.860 --> 01:29:15.660]  terrorist if you pay what cash if you wear blue jeans if you do all types of
[01:29:15.660 --> 01:29:19.060]  benign behavior then we saw the guy come out the other day saying if you just
[01:29:19.060 --> 01:29:21.540]  recently broke up with your girlfriend you're right for a terrorist
[01:29:21.540 --> 01:29:24.500]  recruiting station you know these are type of things that they want you to
[01:29:24.500 --> 01:29:28.500]  believe but it's not a mass hysteria of terror out here just people defending
[01:29:28.500 --> 01:29:32.220]  that country absolutely and the globalists have annihilated any basic
[01:29:32.220 --> 01:29:35.020]  American culture or human culture that's why they want to get rid of the
[01:29:35.020 --> 01:29:39.500]  religion bitter clingers and the guns is because this is one of the few rights
[01:29:39.500 --> 01:29:43.820]  of a free person is being armed and they hate it they want to take it from us
[01:29:43.820 --> 01:29:51.300]  it's their religion to disarm us we're on the march the empire job run great
[01:29:51.300 --> 01:29:56.660]  job to carry joe lex jones and the gc young's coming up at work
[01:29:56.660 --> 01:30:03.180]  economic upheaval has enveloped the european union this year as a result of
[01:30:03.180 --> 01:30:06.340]  bailout practices that have done nothing but make these countries more
[01:30:06.340 --> 01:30:10.260]  insolvent well french president french while haland has proposed a solution he
[01:30:10.260 --> 01:30:13.500]  recently suggested that every member of the eurozone transfer all their
[01:30:13.500 --> 01:30:16.460]  sovereignty to a newly created federal government in other words it would
[01:30:16.460 --> 01:30:19.460]  essentially be a united states of europe the government would have a prime
[01:30:19.460 --> 01:30:22.700]  minister a parliament a federal budget and a federal treasury that's a pretty
[01:30:22.700 --> 01:30:26.380]  good suggestion since your original eurozone bureaucracy and parliament
[01:30:26.380 --> 01:30:29.340]  didn't do anything to help these financial crises except make the banks
[01:30:29.340 --> 01:30:32.500]  richer let's create another big bureaucracy that we could feed money
[01:30:32.500 --> 01:30:36.100]  into therefore kicking the can down the road just a little bit farther michael
[01:30:36.100 --> 01:30:39.300]  schneider notes that during times of emergency the elites are often able to
[01:30:39.300 --> 01:30:42.220]  push through things that they would never be able to accomplish under normal
[01:30:42.220 --> 01:30:46.260]  circumstances and for those of you keeping score a year ago the euro to
[01:30:46.260 --> 01:30:51.580]  dollar ratio was 1.35 today it's come down to 1.08 clearly the european union

[01:37:17.020 --> 01:37:22.660]  powerful safe formula instead of having cuz I noticed melatonin doesn't work all
[01:37:22.660 --> 01:37:26.980]  the time valerian doesn't work all the time but if I take them together if I
[01:37:26.980 --> 01:37:30.700]  said you'll be on coast-to-coast AM till 3 in the morning and I had to drink two
[01:37:30.700 --> 01:37:35.660]  cups of coffee to do it then I can't go to bed till 6 a.m. suddenly I go to
[01:37:35.660 --> 01:37:40.580]  sleep then I got to get up in an hour and I'm just shot well I'll take valerian
[01:37:40.580 --> 01:37:46.420]  I'll take magnesium powder I'll take melatonin to back I think about all
[01:37:46.420 --> 01:37:52.460]  together to do it well guess what it's just all right here in one pill it's all
[01:37:52.460 --> 01:37:59.060]  right here ladies and gentlemen in one pill and believe me it is knockout we've
[01:37:59.060 --> 01:38:02.900]  had this for a few months before the mass production of it happened and it's
[01:38:02.900 --> 01:38:06.620]  got a black label because let me tell you in a moon and stars because it's
[01:38:06.620 --> 01:38:11.300]  going to be sleepy time when you take this you want the ultimate formula for
[01:38:11.300 --> 01:38:22.340]  1995 and to support this transmission info wars life dot com or 888-253-3139
[01:38:22.340 --> 01:38:27.300]  and we did do a very limited run so I think it'll probably sell out in a week
[01:38:27.300 --> 01:38:30.580]  or so then it'll be a few months till we get more in but then we'll get reviews
[01:38:30.580 --> 01:38:33.220]  and it'll be even more popular because we've you know it's the third party
[01:38:33.220 --> 01:38:36.820]  reviews is why our products are so popular we are going to sell out the
[01:38:36.820 --> 01:38:39.860]  next few days I've been telling you of x2 survival shield makes an iodine
[01:38:39.860 --> 01:38:44.780]  supermail vitality did sell out I'm going to give you a little news flash the
[01:38:44.780 --> 01:38:49.940]  only thing different about super female vitality is it has frisky goatweed has
[01:38:49.940 --> 01:38:55.620]  a different name corny goatweed it's got a scientific name and it's more of an
[01:38:55.620 --> 01:39:00.380]  aphrodisiac it has all the same stuff the male stuff has in it and it does some
[01:39:00.380 --> 01:39:04.180]  other things to your body not just the libido but it's super female quite
[01:39:04.180 --> 01:39:08.860]  frankly is the formula I like best even more than super male but group debates
[01:39:08.860 --> 01:39:12.060]  that with me it's different for everybody they go Alex it's not too good if
[01:39:12.060 --> 01:39:16.460]  you say you take female vitality on air whatever the point is is that I take the
[01:39:16.460 --> 01:39:20.580]  female vitality it will sell out the next week and it will be two months
[01:39:20.580 --> 01:39:24.060]  back ordered to even get that the new orders in it's going to sell out
[01:39:24.060 --> 01:39:29.180]  super male did sell out as I told you info wars life calm and that's how we
[01:39:29.180 --> 01:39:32.660]  find our operation so I want to thank you all now let's get this network break
[01:39:32.660 --> 01:39:38.100]  coming up because I went long here I just want to thank all of you for your
[01:39:38.100 --> 01:39:42.660]  support for your prayers we're not perfect here but we're real and we don't
[01:39:42.660 --> 01:39:47.620]  compromise and we're teleprompter free and I get enraged when I see sicko
[01:39:47.620 --> 01:39:51.540]  people sitting around licking their lips drinking wine come up Lamborghinis
[01:39:51.540 --> 01:39:55.740]  they're gonna buy with dead baby part money and then the fact that MSNBC makes
[01:39:55.740 --> 01:40:00.740]  jokes about it these are sick anti-human parasite filth who promise a bunch of
[01:40:00.740 --> 01:40:05.580]  disenfranchised idiots a bigger free lunch if they'll just vote for them I
[01:40:05.580 --> 01:40:09.380]  have no doubt that the people running the Democratic Party are worse than
[01:40:09.380 --> 01:40:12.660]  Stalin if they get full control I mean I mean that when I say it they are
[01:40:12.660 --> 01:40:18.820]  committed servants of pure evil I mean we're facing premeditated evil you go
[01:40:18.820 --> 01:40:22.140]  but that's crazy look at history that's what you get most the time because
[01:40:22.140 --> 01:40:26.020]  that's who wants control that's who's willing to do the horrible things to get
[01:40:26.020 --> 01:40:30.900]  control and good people stand down and they take over in fact any prosperous
[01:40:30.900 --> 01:40:34.900]  nation that's incredibly wealthy and gets decadent tends to fall to this every
[01:40:34.900 --> 01:40:39.060]  time but if you'll spread the word about info wars and others fighting and if
[01:40:39.060 --> 01:40:42.940]  you'll support them and support these pro-life groups financially that are
[01:40:42.940 --> 01:40:45.780]  getting undercover videos I have no connection to them you should be
[01:40:45.780 --> 01:40:49.260]  flooding them with donations they're going to be sued if you will stand
[01:40:49.260 --> 01:40:55.980]  financially and morally with us nothing can stop us but that's what Thomas
[01:40:55.980 --> 01:40:59.940]  Jefferson said all the evil men in tyranny to flourish and triumph is that
[01:40:59.940 --> 01:41:06.580]  good men do nothing stop doing nothing take action good men and women everywhere
[01:41:06.580 --> 01:41:11.020]  you have the power and I salute you I want to thank you for all of your
[01:41:11.020 --> 01:41:21.260]  support now joining us in studio is my son Rex Jones he's a little bit nervous
[01:41:21.260 --> 01:41:26.740]  he's done a lot I don't know 15 or 20 video reports that he conceived some of
[01:41:26.740 --> 01:41:32.100]  them himself 100% others are 50 50 others are 60 40 but overall these
[01:41:32.100 --> 01:41:35.860]  reports you're seeing are written up with Rex with a little bit oversight by
[01:41:35.860 --> 01:41:41.180]  myself and Rob do and Josh Owens and others and Jacarie Jackson and Darren
[01:41:41.180 --> 01:41:46.060]  McBreen and Leanne McAdoo and and and David Knight of all taking him under
[01:41:46.060 --> 01:41:49.940]  their wing and during the summer he's here a few days a week when he's not
[01:41:49.940 --> 01:41:56.660]  in tennis camp or in other camps Christian camp and he's here with us and
[01:41:56.660 --> 01:42:01.580]  he wants to be part of the info war he likes to read adult history books he is
[01:42:01.580 --> 01:42:07.500]  undoubtedly cut out for this and I intend for him to eclipse what I've done
[01:42:07.500 --> 01:42:14.860]  and he's he's way greater person than I was at 12 and I'm not building you up
[01:42:14.860 --> 01:42:17.620]  Rex I want you to know you're always thank you dad for letting me be on air
[01:42:17.620 --> 01:42:21.820]  he has a passion for it not as a narcissist but as someone who wants to
[01:42:21.820 --> 01:42:26.180]  help people and who wants to fight tyranny he has a sense of justice and
[01:42:26.180 --> 01:42:32.420]  in Christ in his heart and and I was pretty wicked when I was 12 Rex is is
[01:42:32.420 --> 01:42:36.220]  just I love you so much and I didn't mean to get you up here sweetheart and
[01:42:36.220 --> 01:42:40.140]  tell people how much I love you but it you're so handsome you're you're you're
[01:42:40.140 --> 01:42:44.060]  a good little knight who's gonna grow up to I know be a great fighter against the
[01:42:44.060 --> 01:42:47.900]  enemy and I just thank God every day that he's given me a son like this and
[01:42:47.900 --> 01:42:51.020]  two daughters as well I love you so much I'm so proud of you tell us about this
[01:42:51.020 --> 01:42:56.020]  report that we're about to premiere here on air well thanks dad the report the
[01:42:56.020 --> 01:42:59.580]  we're about to roll out the number one environmental threat to humanity today
[01:42:59.580 --> 01:43:04.300]  is gonna it's gonna be very exciting I learned a lot when I was when I was
[01:43:04.300 --> 01:43:07.460]  rolling out that when I was rolling out and doing the research for this report
[01:43:07.460 --> 01:43:11.780]  and I really hope you enjoy it but just to clarify before we actually play the
[01:43:11.780 --> 01:43:17.100]  report this is not I'm not talking about a supernova or an asteroid hitting the
[01:43:17.100 --> 01:43:21.980]  earth I'm talking about the biggest threats that humanity has created against
[01:43:21.980 --> 01:43:26.720]  humans so we're our hope but we're also our greatest threat within that
[01:43:26.720 --> 01:43:30.980]  paradox lies the way out of this and understanding it and people that hate
[01:43:30.980 --> 01:43:34.900]  humanity people that love to dump people down they have no right to be in
[01:43:34.900 --> 01:43:38.980]  leadership positions and historically they will destroy us the type of
[01:43:38.980 --> 01:43:42.980]  disasters they create with the technology we now have will destroy us and
[01:43:42.980 --> 01:43:48.380]  their evil confidence will be their undoing the problem is it may be all of
[01:43:48.380 --> 01:43:52.100]  our undoing so we're gonna go to this report and come back with some articles
[01:43:52.100 --> 01:43:56.180]  where we show pharmacological crops and other things that are just really
[01:43:56.180 --> 01:44:03.020]  dangerous here is this report I'm Rex Jones reporting for info wars.com I'm
[01:44:03.020 --> 01:44:07.100]  here at the Greenbelt in Austin where most people here think that pollution
[01:44:07.100 --> 01:44:11.540]  such as littering and runoff are the two biggest problems in our world today
[01:44:11.540 --> 01:44:15.500]  and if you look around here that's easy to see there are things such as empty
[01:44:15.500 --> 01:44:21.340]  beer cans, beer bottles, abandoned shirts, abandoned pants, styrofoam cups, all sorts
[01:44:21.340 --> 01:44:25.060]  of pollutants we've picked up a little bit of garbage from our surrounding area
[01:44:25.060 --> 01:44:29.620]  but this is just a small version of the landfills and dirty creeks and rivers
[01:44:29.620 --> 01:44:34.100]  that the government likes to paint in our head as an idea of pollution what
[01:44:34.100 --> 01:44:38.180]  they're really trying to cover up is much bigger than a little landfill in
[01:44:38.180 --> 01:44:42.460]  fact it is starting to consume the whole world what is it you're about to
[01:44:42.460 --> 01:44:53.180]  find out we've talked about garbage on the ground what about the garbage in our
[01:44:53.180 --> 01:44:58.300]  rivers and streams this garbage is called runoff and it drifts through our
[01:44:58.300 --> 01:45:04.140]  whole planet's water system of rivers lakes and oceans to form a giant trash
[01:45:04.140 --> 01:45:10.620]  continent in the Pacific Ocean which I'm gonna go in Gargia. Is Gargia the biggest
[01:45:10.620 --> 01:45:18.780]  threat to the environment today? I think not but before we leave the water let's
[01:45:18.780 --> 01:45:23.700]  separate the facts and myths of the Pacific Island garbage patch first it's
[01:45:23.700 --> 01:45:27.460]  not a giant island of garbage as depicted in this picture here it's
[01:45:27.460 --> 01:45:31.260]  actually made up of very small and microscopic pieces of plastic that
[01:45:31.260 --> 01:45:36.260]  covers 5,000 square kilometers in the North Pacific gyre the jet stream and
[01:45:36.260 --> 01:45:40.140]  southern tree winds create a giant circling region of water another myth
[01:45:40.140 --> 01:45:44.780]  is that plastic is killing animals while it's true that plastic is being found
[01:45:44.780 --> 01:45:48.900]  in the stomachs of dead birds and fish it's not yet known if the plastic is the
[01:45:48.900 --> 01:45:53.900]  actual cause of death also small water insects crabs and barnacles have
[01:45:53.900 --> 01:45:58.100]  thrived on the particles and are now found in abundance across the ocean in
[01:45:58.100 --> 01:46:01.500]  addition to being an eyesore and potentially deadly to marine life
[01:46:01.500 --> 01:46:05.540]  runoff is not the biggest problem we face in our environment now let's take
[01:46:05.540 --> 01:46:14.740]  to the skies and cover a different kind of pollution air pollution has been
[01:46:14.740 --> 01:46:19.180]  with us since humans first learned how to harness fire in 1952 pollutants from
[01:46:19.180 --> 01:46:24.680]  factories and home fireplaces mixed with air condensation killed at least 4,000
[01:46:24.680 --> 01:46:28.540]  people in London over the course of several days a few years earlier in
[01:46:28.540 --> 01:46:33.200]  1948 severe industrial air pollution created a deadly smog that
[01:46:33.200 --> 01:46:38.860]  affixiated 20 people in Denora, Pennsylvania and made 7,000 more sick
[01:46:38.860 --> 01:46:44.180]  acid rain first discovered in the 1850s was another problem resulting from cold
[01:46:44.180 --> 01:46:48.820]  powered plants regulations and technology have helped clean up most of
[01:46:48.820 --> 01:46:53.460]  these problems so now pollution is not as much of a problem in developed first
[01:46:53.460 --> 01:46:58.220]  world nations in China and other emerging countries air pollution is a huge
[01:46:58.220 --> 01:47:02.780]  problem and it spread through the jet stream mercury black carbon dust and
[01:47:02.780 --> 01:47:06.620]  ozone are just a few of the pollutants that are carried by the jet stream over
[01:47:06.620 --> 01:47:11.180]  the Pacific Ocean and are being dumped in the United States currently China is
[01:47:11.180 --> 01:47:15.580]  building up to four dirty coal burning power plants a month it consumes over
[01:47:15.580 --> 01:47:21.380]  four times the cold in the United States Obama led EPA regulations that will
[01:47:21.380 --> 01:47:25.460]  shutter most of our coal burning plants by 2030 so you can look forward to the
[01:47:25.460 --> 01:47:29.740]  higher power prices and breathing the dirty air produced by China another
[01:47:29.740 --> 01:47:35.380]  environmental danger is called CCD or colony collapse disorder this happens
[01:47:35.380 --> 01:47:40.300]  when a hive of bees is unexplainably wiped out nearly all CCD is being caused
[01:47:40.300 --> 01:47:45.620]  by either RFID radiation or Monsanto pollen that bees carry to other normal
[01:47:45.620 --> 01:47:51.100]  crops Albert Einstein once said that if the bees were wiped out all of humanity
[01:47:51.100 --> 01:47:56.020]  would vanish within four years recently Harvard researchers linked pesticide use
[01:47:56.020 --> 01:48:00.900]  specifically neonicotinoid insecticides acts as nerve poisons and mimic the
[01:48:00.900 --> 01:48:05.740]  effects of nicotine as a major cause of colony collapse disorder over the last
[01:48:05.740 --> 01:48:10.900]  six years American beekeepers have lost 30% of their highs each winter on
[01:48:10.900 --> 01:48:14.860]  average and as companies like Monsanto keep producing neonicotinoid
[01:48:14.860 --> 01:48:21.140]  insecticides future colony collapses are guaranteed now let's look at an unseen
[01:48:21.140 --> 01:48:26.980]  pollutant nuclear radiation we don't know what the exact full fallout from the
[01:48:26.980 --> 01:48:31.220]  nuclear bomb testing in leaps for nuclear power plants are but the issue is
[01:48:31.220 --> 01:48:34.900]  brought to the forefront when the Fukushima power plant reactors melted
[01:48:34.900 --> 01:48:41.140]  down after a tsunami hit Japan on March 11th 2011
[01:48:44.660 --> 01:48:50.060]  since that time countless gallons of radioactive cool water has poured into
[01:48:50.060 --> 01:48:53.900]  the Pacific Ocean radiation spikes have been found along West Coast beaches and
[01:48:53.900 --> 01:48:57.980]  there are more and more reports about massive sea life die-offs in dead zones
[01:48:57.980 --> 01:49:02.100]  being created in the ocean can't see the radiation but the effects in the rise
[01:49:02.100 --> 01:49:06.620]  of cancers and birth defects in Japan is a direct result it's disasters like
[01:49:06.620 --> 01:49:11.380]  Fukushima Chernobyl and Three Mile Island or a full-scale nuclear war that
[01:49:11.380 --> 01:49:15.140]  could potentially end all life on earth but it is not the biggest threat to our
[01:49:15.140 --> 01:49:20.820]  environment now that we've covered litter runoff CCD particulates coming in
[01:49:20.820 --> 01:49:24.180]  through the jet stream and nuclear radiation coming from places like
[01:49:24.180 --> 01:49:28.380]  Fukushima I'm about to tell you what I consider the biggest threat to humanity
[01:49:28.380 --> 01:49:34.500]  is GMOs real danger is not what is seen but what is unseen not only have GMOs
[01:49:34.500 --> 01:49:39.660]  been linked to numerous health problems but the pollen blow off from Monsanto
[01:49:39.660 --> 01:49:44.860]  farms to other normal farms is causing unseen and unprecedented mutation
[01:49:44.860 --> 01:49:49.660]  within the normal biosphere everything we've talked about before this we knew
[01:49:49.660 --> 01:49:54.380]  the dangers and we knew how to deal with it but with GMO crops the answer still
[01:49:54.380 --> 01:49:57.860]  remains a mystery because we don't know what's going to happen within these
[01:49:57.860 --> 01:50:01.460]  mutations after three or four generations have passed here's our
[01:50:01.460 --> 01:50:07.180]  friend Jeffrey Smith to talk about GMOs and their dangers all of the toxins
[01:50:07.180 --> 01:50:14.100]  that are released into the environment GMOs are of a special class you see with
[01:50:14.100 --> 01:50:20.020]  genetic engineering you have pollution of the gene pool it's a self-propagating
[01:50:20.020 --> 01:50:25.740]  genetic pollution the genes that we released in this generation already can
[01:50:25.740 --> 01:50:32.260]  outlast nuclear waste they can go on forever we have no technology to fully
[01:50:32.260 --> 01:50:37.500]  clean up this type of pollution certainly we can reduce it dramatically but
[01:50:37.500 --> 01:50:42.140]  until we have some technique to identify GMOs at a distance we are stuck with
[01:50:42.140 --> 01:50:47.300]  GMOs possibly forever imagine being hired by a company that says we have a
[01:50:47.300 --> 01:50:51.860]  little problem we'd like you to organize the recall of our salmon from the
[01:50:51.860 --> 01:50:56.100]  ocean there's a company that wants to introduce genetically modified mosquitoes
[01:50:56.100 --> 01:51:01.740]  imagine trying to do a recall there GM pollen has already contaminated the
[01:51:01.740 --> 01:51:06.940]  indigenous corn varieties of Mexico and we have no technology to clean that up
[01:51:06.940 --> 01:51:13.000]  what we've done is irreversible damage and this is something that is highly
[01:51:13.000 --> 01:51:17.460]  irresponsible unconscionable and it was done over the objections of
[01:51:17.460 --> 01:51:22.300]  scientists over the objections of science a collusion between government
[01:51:22.300 --> 01:51:26.620]  and industry there are two main reasons why people genetically modified foods
[01:51:26.620 --> 01:51:32.300]  they either drink poison or produce poison the poison drinkers are called
[01:51:32.300 --> 01:51:37.580]  herbicide tolerant most popular variety is roundup ready let me explain
[01:51:37.580 --> 01:51:41.900]  one Santos scientists found bacteria growing in a chemical waste dump near
[01:51:41.900 --> 01:51:46.380]  their factory surviving in the presence of their herbicide called roundup so
[01:51:46.380 --> 01:51:50.100]  they had the brilliant idea let's put it in the food supply so they took the gene
[01:51:50.100 --> 01:51:54.580]  from the bacterium that allowed it to survive applications of roundup and put
[01:51:54.580 --> 01:51:59.940]  it into soybean corn cotton canola etc so now you can spray the field with
[01:51:59.940 --> 01:52:04.380]  roundup and it kills all of the other plant biodiversity in the field but not
[01:52:04.380 --> 01:52:09.180]  the roundup ready soy and roundup ready corn the other variety of genetically
[01:52:09.180 --> 01:52:14.180]  modified crops produces a poison if they take a gene from a soil bacterium that
[01:52:14.180 --> 01:52:19.500]  produces a natural insecticide and put it into the DNA of the plant so every
[01:52:19.500 --> 01:52:23.540]  single cell of every single plant in millions of acres has its own little
[01:52:23.540 --> 01:52:27.860]  spray bottle that can kill an insect by destroying its digestive system what
[01:52:27.860 --> 01:52:33.180]  these changes mean is that the plant might produce more allergens more toxins
[01:52:33.180 --> 01:52:37.860]  more anti nutrients more carcinogens or even less of these we don't know it's a
[01:52:37.860 --> 01:52:43.180]  genetic roulette in fact the process of approval of these GM crops do not
[01:52:43.180 --> 01:52:47.620]  evaluate these type of changes in Monsanto's own studies which they
[01:52:47.620 --> 01:52:50.820]  conveniently left out of their published paper which we were covered later
[01:52:50.820 --> 01:52:54.920]  they found that in cooked GM soy there was as much as seven times more of a
[01:52:54.920 --> 01:52:59.140]  known allergen called trypsin inhibitor and about a doubling of an anti nutrient
[01:52:59.140 --> 01:53:03.580]  called soy lectin which blocks the absorption of certain nutrients and
[01:53:03.580 --> 01:53:07.900]  genetically modified corn a gene which is normally switched off was switched
[01:53:07.900 --> 01:53:12.140]  on to produce an allergen and other proteins were truncated or changed in
[01:53:12.140 --> 01:53:16.340]  shape which can change a harmless protein into a potentially deadly one in
[01:53:16.340 --> 01:53:20.860]  fact when they looked at that corn variety they found 43 different proteins
[01:53:20.860 --> 01:53:24.300]  that had significantly changed the levels of expression because of the
[01:53:24.300 --> 01:53:29.060]  genetic insertion so these could be called wreaking havoc with our health or
[01:53:29.060 --> 01:53:33.420]  the environment but no one has evaluated them genetically modified foods and
[01:53:33.420 --> 01:53:37.580]  crops are one of the most dangerous health and environmental catastrophes
[01:53:37.580 --> 01:53:42.460]  we're facing and yet very few people know about it now you know why we here at
[01:53:42.460 --> 01:53:46.580]  info wars believe that GMOs are the biggest threats to our planet today we
[01:53:46.580 --> 01:53:51.300]  know the true dangers of a cigarette butt left flying out unattended in a field
[01:53:51.300 --> 01:53:55.620]  but do we really know the dangers of GMOs and can we trust our government to
[01:53:55.620 --> 01:54:00.780]  tell us I'm Rex Schillings reporting for info wars.com
[01:54:00.780 --> 01:54:06.180]  well done my apprentice well Rex Jones is here with us and he's got some other
[01:54:06.180 --> 01:54:10.140]  added points because it's much worse than he was even breaking down there and I
[01:54:10.140 --> 01:54:14.220]  agree with his overall analysis the GMO is the biggest threat because it's
[01:54:14.220 --> 01:54:18.780]  already happening we already know it's caused a bunch of problems and it's
[01:54:18.780 --> 01:54:22.540]  just getting more and more out of control and the establishment just doesn't
[01:54:22.540 --> 01:54:27.420]  care and they're already putting GMO salmon in the ocean obviously nuclear
[01:54:27.420 --> 01:54:33.140]  war is a bigger threat by itself but it hasn't happened yet the establishment
[01:54:33.140 --> 01:54:37.260]  has shown they're just going forward with this giant mad scientist island of
[01:54:37.260 --> 01:54:42.660]  Dr. Maru disaster so Rex I noticed you did some research in the last few days
[01:54:42.660 --> 01:54:47.100]  yes and pulled up a whole bunch of news articles illustrating about pharmacological
[01:54:47.100 --> 01:54:52.260]  crops starlink what we know is already going on and this is just what we know
[01:54:52.260 --> 01:54:59.460]  and it's off the chart and saying absolutely like take this one article
[01:54:59.460 --> 01:55:05.060]  protogene officials may face jail slash contamination could be AIDS vaccine or
[01:55:05.060 --> 01:55:11.780]  blood thickener in the crop protogene officials may face jail time for they
[01:55:11.780 --> 01:55:15.180]  actually contaminated they've been caught with contaminated crops they
[01:55:15.180 --> 01:55:20.540]  almost went to jail for this a while ago because the crop was found with AIDS
[01:55:20.540 --> 01:55:24.980]  vaccine in it I'm not kidding you AIDS back live virus live virus it was
[01:55:24.980 --> 01:55:28.700]  growing the virus absolutely and they planted it open air well you shouldn't
[01:55:28.700 --> 01:55:33.580]  plant it in a in a I mean everybody knows seeds get out and pollen blows you
[01:55:33.580 --> 01:55:35.900]  shouldn't plant it inside a green absolutely that's one of the biggest
[01:55:35.900 --> 01:55:40.580]  that's absolutely that's one of the biggest threats with GMO is the pollen
[01:55:40.580 --> 01:55:44.340]  blow-off there's like you'd have a Monsanto farm then you have an organic
[01:55:44.340 --> 01:55:50.700]  farm right next to it naturally the way plants reproduce is pollen from one
[01:55:50.700 --> 01:55:55.500]  plant is carried by pollinators to another plant or the wind that is a
[01:55:55.500 --> 01:56:03.340]  pollinator absolutely so even so with that threat it means that organic crops
[01:56:03.340 --> 01:56:09.660]  can be contaminated by Monsanto or other major big pharma regime crop like
[01:56:09.660 --> 01:56:15.780]  that very easily and another like studies show that this isn't good like a rat
[01:56:15.780 --> 01:56:25.260]  fed a lot rats fit a lifetime of GMO of GMO corn 70% of females die early and
[01:56:25.260 --> 01:56:29.260]  they grow corn and they grow tumors I don't want to look like the dude in
[01:56:29.260 --> 01:56:33.860]  Mad Max that has big lumps all over his bodies all over his body and is
[01:56:33.860 --> 01:56:37.500]  completely insane I don't think that that's a very interesting against
[01:56:37.500 --> 01:56:42.380]  mutations now I don't care I don't want and again this is associated press and
[01:56:42.380 --> 01:56:47.780]  Reuters this is Reuters this particular one protein officials may face jail for
[01:56:47.780 --> 01:56:52.620]  contamination could be AIDS vaccine let me have the other article I'll give
[01:56:52.620 --> 01:56:58.500]  folks a source on that just in case they circle are doubting us this is a Mike
[01:56:58.500 --> 01:57:02.920]  Adams natural news article new GMO study rats fed lifetime of GM corn grow
[01:57:02.920 --> 01:57:08.340]  tumors 70% of females die early and that links through to the grocer dot co dot
[01:57:08.340 --> 01:57:14.740]  UK and through the new shock government study by the government itself GMO is
[01:57:14.740 --> 01:57:19.220]  even so bad like Taco Bell the worst of the worst the people that scrape grease
[01:57:19.220 --> 01:57:24.060]  off the bottom of the well let's not go into that break down the actual report
[01:57:24.060 --> 01:57:29.220]  on Starlink corn alright so Starlink corn a genetically modified foods food
[01:57:29.220 --> 01:57:34.180]  source back a little while ago they recalled almost actually I think it
[01:57:34.180 --> 01:57:38.180]  was all of their all of their corn tortillas that they sold in grocery
[01:57:38.180 --> 01:57:42.860]  stores as Taco Bell products because they were not approved to sell to the
[01:57:42.860 --> 01:57:45.980]  public that's right in Starlink corn have been linked to massive health
[01:57:45.980 --> 01:57:49.700]  problems and animals there was a feed corn oh they had to recall it from being
[01:57:49.700 --> 01:57:52.740]  fed to animals oh yeah I'm just giving you examples of what's happened in the
[01:57:52.740 --> 01:57:56.620]  last decade you have dozens more of these articles and then like another
[01:57:56.620 --> 01:58:02.260]  example of when companies big companies like Monsanto they've made roundup
[01:58:02.260 --> 01:58:06.300]  ready corn that's the New York Times let's get into that New York Times weed
[01:58:06.300 --> 01:58:11.020]  killer long cleared is doubted so 30 years ago an environmental protection
[01:58:11.020 --> 01:58:15.100]  agency committed committee determined that the popular read weed killer
[01:58:15.100 --> 01:58:19.340]  roundup might cause cancer 60 they knew all along and told you it was safe to
[01:58:19.340 --> 01:58:24.580]  drink tell us stay there Rex Jones doing a great job a little nervous around the
[01:58:24.580 --> 01:58:28.780]  dinner table he's completely fluent but you're doing a super good job when we
[01:58:28.780 --> 01:58:32.460]  come back we got five more minutes for our next guest joins us on the gun grab
[01:58:32.460 --> 01:58:35.620]  if you're on social security and get disability money they're coming for
[01:58:35.620 --> 01:58:38.420]  your guns we've got a daily caller investigative journalist that broke the
[01:58:38.420 --> 01:58:44.820]  news joining us so stay with us this is GCN the Genesis communications radio
[01:58:44.820 --> 01:58:47.180]  network
[01:58:48.180 --> 01:58:52.060]  ladies and gentlemen you haven't really ever heard firearms manufacturers and
[01:58:52.060 --> 01:58:55.700]  sponsors on my syndicated radio show or the nightly news or the news website
[01:58:55.700 --> 01:59:00.220]  info wars.com because the companies I've been approached by were not the
[01:59:00.220 --> 01:59:04.180]  highest quality and they weren't as affordable as they should be so I
[01:59:04.180 --> 01:59:08.820]  refused probably 30 40 firearms manufacturers over the years will then
[01:59:08.820 --> 01:59:14.420]  about six months ago we get contacted by head down firearms HD firearms.com
[01:59:14.420 --> 01:59:18.220]  own and run by a bunch of former Navy SEALs special ops people their
[01:59:18.220 --> 01:59:21.940]  veterans their patriots their listeners of the radio show and they want to
[01:59:21.940 --> 01:59:25.900]  support the broadcast it's always about security whether it's for yourself your
[01:59:25.900 --> 01:59:30.260]  wife your loved ones go to their website HDfirearms.com buy right off their
[01:59:30.260 --> 01:59:34.300]  website and they'll just send it to the FFL dealer of your choice you can pick
[01:59:34.300 --> 01:59:37.020]  it up at the gun show you can pick it up at the local sporting goods store
[01:59:37.020 --> 01:59:44.180]  whatever you do get your head down firearm today the spirit of 1776 lives

[01:59:49.740 --> 01:59:55.620]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[02:00:03.900 --> 02:00:11.700]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does
[02:00:11.700 --> 02:00:19.220]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[02:00:19.220 --> 02:00:22.700]  Alex Jones
[02:00:27.660 --> 02:00:32.260]  stories up on info wars.com explosive military recruiting centers nationwide
[02:00:32.260 --> 02:00:35.340]  perceived threats armed forces locations on alert up for Chattanooga
[02:00:35.340 --> 02:00:39.820]  shooting and now there's a purported bombscare with a man saying he planted a
[02:00:39.820 --> 02:00:44.540]  bomb in a recruiting center in Florida that's from news 13 Orlando that's being
[02:00:44.540 --> 02:00:48.980]  added to our article on info wars.com Rex Jones is here with us you were
[02:00:48.980 --> 02:00:54.420]  getting into weed killer New York Times now they're basically admitting that back
[02:00:54.420 --> 02:00:59.300]  when it was approved scientists thought it would potentially grow tumors. Yes sir
[02:00:59.300 --> 02:01:04.780]  and another thing about this is the roundup ready corn if it's basically
[02:01:04.780 --> 02:01:07.620]  what they what they did with that is they added genes so it would be more
[02:01:07.620 --> 02:01:14.180]  resistant and even totally tolerate roundup but that's not all if these
[02:01:14.180 --> 02:01:18.500]  genes if the corn can totally tolerate roundup that means that they can
[02:01:18.500 --> 02:01:28.060]  saturate an entire field with this known to cause cancer and pesticide but does
[02:01:28.060 --> 02:01:31.380]  that mean it's gonna get into our food stuff this is kind of thing that rots
[02:01:31.380 --> 02:01:36.860]  out bugs stomachs. That's right the studies on the honey bees. Absolutely. Well it is
[02:01:36.860 --> 02:01:41.740]  getting in the food supply as it bio accumulates in it. Yes traces of this
[02:01:41.740 --> 02:01:46.620]  roundup there's not there's not really a surefire way to get rid of a hundred
[02:01:46.620 --> 02:01:50.460]  percent of pesticide sure you can get rid of eighty percent sure you can get
[02:01:50.460 --> 02:01:53.460]  rid of ninety percent sure you can get rid of ninety five percent well what
[02:01:53.460 --> 02:01:56.780]  about that other five percent this is kind of thing that's been shown to
[02:01:56.780 --> 02:02:00.660]  create problems. That's right now let's go to some of the other articles you dug
[02:02:00.660 --> 02:02:03.540]  up and this is stuff you went and printed off I've seen a lot of this but a lot of
[02:02:03.540 --> 02:02:07.500]  that I hadn't even seen before what's this Harvard report. Okay this is actually
[02:02:07.500 --> 02:02:11.820]  from Harvard one of our most one of our one of the best colleges in this
[02:02:11.820 --> 02:02:17.300]  country. So study strengthens link between neonicotinoids and collapse of
[02:02:17.300 --> 02:02:20.580]  honeybee colonies I don't even know if I pronounced that right but earlier in the
[02:02:20.580 --> 02:02:24.700]  video I was talking about collapse of honeybees. This stuff ties into GMO
[02:02:24.700 --> 02:02:29.980]  crops as well as this as neonicotinoids can be put on crops that have been
[02:02:29.980 --> 02:02:36.260]  engineered to be more resistant to them bees will come to these crops try to
[02:02:36.260 --> 02:02:41.140]  pollinate and then be killed or take this poison back to their hive and cause
[02:02:41.140 --> 02:02:45.540]  total collapse. That's right but who needs bees I mean you know it's racist if
[02:02:45.540 --> 02:02:48.700]  you don't want to kill them all. Well Albert Einstein said that if they all
[02:02:48.700 --> 02:02:53.340]  died we'd be gone in four years. I guess Albert Einstein's a racist. That's right
[02:02:53.340 --> 02:02:57.260]  let's go anybody that questions the official system is racist don't like
[02:02:57.260 --> 02:03:00.180]  death panels you're racist don't turn your guns in you're racist don't want to
[02:03:00.180 --> 02:03:02.980]  plan parenthood to make hundreds of millions of dead babies you're racist.
[02:03:02.980 --> 02:03:07.100]  Let's go to some of the other articles. Okay my final my one of my final
[02:03:07.100 --> 02:03:12.020]  articles would be about how Monsanto likes to launch damage control over GMO
[02:03:12.020 --> 02:03:17.140]  cancer studies. So biotech giant Monsanto has launched a desperate damage
[02:03:17.140 --> 02:03:21.140]  control effort in the aftermath aftermath of French study which found
[02:03:21.140 --> 02:03:26.340]  that rats fed on Monsanto genetically engineered corn were far more likely to
[02:03:26.340 --> 02:03:33.860]  suffer tumors, organ failure and death. And you've just got article after article
[02:03:33.860 --> 02:03:38.900]  continuing on out into infinity. Oh absolutely if you look if you actually
[02:03:38.900 --> 02:03:44.900]  look at the dangers of GMO crops if you look up GMO danger online there are
[02:03:44.900 --> 02:03:49.060]  countless studies by well-known colleges by well-known professors all sorts of
[02:03:49.060 --> 02:03:53.900]  people in the mainstream media likes to get into the mindset of oh I'm sorry
[02:03:53.900 --> 02:03:58.340]  that that study was incomplete oh I'm sorry that study is irrelevant we have
[02:03:58.340 --> 02:04:05.700]  these new studies done by the very people that make the crops that show the exact
[02:04:05.700 --> 02:04:09.820]  opposite and that they're good for you. Put two and two together folks if you
[02:04:09.820 --> 02:04:14.860]  have a shred of gray matter in your brain connect the dots. Well the public has
[02:04:14.860 --> 02:04:17.460]  done it so that's why I don't want us to even know if this stuff's in there and
[02:04:17.460 --> 02:04:22.660]  stop labeling but when you look at the generation of the human brain the body
[02:04:22.660 --> 02:04:27.340]  all of this cocktail of poisonous killings. So we don't have a suicide pack
[02:04:27.340 --> 02:04:30.780]  with these corporations who are you genesis and are doing this on purpose
[02:04:30.780 --> 02:04:35.860]  it's like Bayer normally putting HIV in their factor 8 for hemophilia acts to
[02:04:35.860 --> 02:04:40.980]  kill them. I think his mic got turned off just now
[02:04:40.980 --> 02:04:45.340]  turn this mic back on I'm sorry go ahead and finish up. Just the final thing I'd
[02:04:45.340 --> 02:04:49.820]  like to say before we go out to break would have to be do your own thinking
[02:04:49.820 --> 02:04:56.420]  okay don't watch the programs on CNN that say oh don't listen to them these
[02:04:56.420 --> 02:05:01.340]  studies. He doesn't have a teleprompter. Do you feel depressed? Have you recently
[02:05:01.340 --> 02:05:06.100]  lost a job or a girlfriend? Well according to Wesley Clark then you're
[02:05:06.100 --> 02:05:10.860]  ripe for radicalization. That's right not content with the Fed saying that pain
[02:05:10.860 --> 02:05:14.540]  with cash was a sign of potential terrorism. Clark has doubled down and
[02:05:14.540 --> 02:05:18.860]  suggests that the aforementioned people should be locked away in internment camps.
[02:05:18.860 --> 02:05:24.020]  Well we've got to identify the people who are most likely to be radicalized.
[02:05:24.020 --> 02:05:27.980]  There are always a certain number of young people who are alienated. They
[02:05:27.980 --> 02:05:31.940]  don't get a job, they lost a girlfriend, their family doesn't feel happy here. If
[02:05:31.940 --> 02:05:36.820]  someone supported Nazi Germany at the expense of the United States we didn't
[02:05:36.820 --> 02:05:41.020]  say that was freedom of speech. We put him in a camp. They were
[02:05:41.020 --> 02:05:46.580]  prisoners of war so if these people are radicalized and they don't support the
[02:05:46.580 --> 02:05:50.660]  United States and they're disloyal to the United States it's our right and our
[02:05:50.660 --> 02:05:55.180]  obligation to segregate them from the normal community. You can find more

[02:08:32.940 --> 02:08:38.860]  Coming up at the bottom of the hour it was the daily caller that broke the
[02:08:38.860 --> 02:08:43.860]  story. Late last week that was in the LA Times on Sunday they came out in the
[02:08:43.860 --> 02:08:47.220]  city and said yeah the VA knows how to take guns from people that have problems
[02:08:47.220 --> 02:08:52.460]  why social security is going to basically be run by the VA and they're
[02:08:52.460 --> 02:08:56.860]  going to decide which people on social security get their guns taken because if
[02:08:56.860 --> 02:09:00.540]  it's found you can't take care of yourself maybe you're paralyzed from the
[02:09:00.540 --> 02:09:04.540]  stomach down maybe you had PTSD but but physical stuff as well you're going to
[02:09:04.540 --> 02:09:10.980]  have your guns taken. Newton no jury no judge no law you're not a felon this is
[02:09:10.980 --> 02:09:17.860]  the 68 gun control act with Obama just expanding it outside of law and they're
[02:09:17.860 --> 02:09:21.940]  reporting it like it's no big deal that's coming up at the bottom of the
[02:09:21.940 --> 02:09:28.980]  hour Patrick Howley from the Daily Caller will be joining us to go over all of
[02:09:28.980 --> 02:09:36.020]  this it is simply incredible. In other news and there is a ton of it Swedish
[02:09:36.020 --> 02:09:42.140]  immigration officer exposes jihadist sympathizer liking ISIS homepages she
[02:09:42.140 --> 02:09:46.740]  says this shows Islamophobia when she said stuff like great job or women
[02:09:46.740 --> 02:09:50.420]  joining it wonderful you're so beautiful and I guess she likes wearing
[02:09:50.420 --> 02:09:54.460]  lipstick and not having to wear a hood over her head. Sweden's reputation as a
[02:09:54.460 --> 02:09:59.380]  place where extreme liberalism has run rampant that means anything anti-western
[02:09:59.380 --> 02:10:02.900]  make me aliens coming to say we're killing everyone on earth they go oh
[02:10:02.900 --> 02:10:07.060]  it's liberal it's anti-human was cemented further after it was revealed
[02:10:07.060 --> 02:10:11.260]  the top official responsible for the country's immigration policy is a jihadist
[02:10:11.260 --> 02:10:17.540]  sympathizer. The country also wants to pay to bring jihadist year into Sweden
[02:10:17.540 --> 02:10:22.500]  from around the world to rehabilitate them from their PTSD and then they've
[02:10:22.500 --> 02:10:28.460]  had other top officials she's one of the top people it's in Paul's article two
[02:10:28.460 --> 02:10:32.260]  months ago he made a video which he documented how Sweden was a case study
[02:10:32.260 --> 02:10:35.060]  in what happens to countries where they embrace the mental disorder known as
[02:10:35.060 --> 02:10:40.780]  extreme liberalism social counselors socialist counselors in Sweden want to
[02:10:40.780 --> 02:10:44.820]  offer psychological help and taxpayer funded jobs to help recruiting ISIS
[02:10:44.820 --> 02:10:49.820]  jihadists reintegrate into Western society after they got bored of stoning
[02:10:49.820 --> 02:10:55.180]  women and throwing gaze off buildings in Iraq and Syria so they want to teach
[02:10:55.180 --> 02:10:58.700]  your five-year-old how to be gay but then it's okay oh but you throw gaze off
[02:10:58.700 --> 02:11:02.860]  buildings that's sexy ooh that's liberal and you smoke a hookah how different the
[02:11:02.860 --> 02:11:06.500]  story is not a bizarre so bizarre that many people thought it was a hoax but it
[02:11:06.500 --> 02:11:10.340]  wasn't a hoax prominent voices of Sweden are actually calling on taxpayers to come
[02:11:10.340 --> 02:11:13.900]  to the aid of jihad militants who re-enter the country and it just goes on
[02:11:13.900 --> 02:11:17.980]  to talk about how one of the heads of the program is is a white guy going to
[02:11:17.980 --> 02:11:24.900]  join ISIS continuing here and again this article is coming up as I just
[02:11:24.900 --> 02:11:29.940]  mentioned ATF works with FBI and VA to get veterans guns taken away Patrick
[02:11:29.940 --> 02:11:33.580]  Halley's coming up to go over that Reverend Graham has come out and said
[02:11:33.580 --> 02:11:37.900]  we're under attack stop all immigration of Muslims to the US it's kind of like
[02:11:37.900 --> 02:11:45.500]  ban the rebel flag is some racist used it that type of police state move will
[02:11:45.500 --> 02:11:48.700]  end up being used against everybody I do think if you come from a radicalized
[02:11:48.700 --> 02:11:52.900]  country and you won't disavow it or you have any connection to it you shouldn't
[02:11:52.900 --> 02:11:56.140]  be able to come here I mean I agree with that I think it being too broad will be
[02:11:56.140 --> 02:12:00.220]  used to then poo poo the whole thing but it shows how concerned the public is
[02:12:00.220 --> 02:12:03.340]  getting because people aren't compatible that no so they say do you think
[02:12:03.340 --> 02:12:07.500]  women should wear hoods over their heads and have their genitals mutilated they
[02:12:07.500 --> 02:12:11.100]  say well yes of course do you think liquor store should be legal no well
[02:12:11.100 --> 02:12:14.980]  see okay well if you were a citizen you could hold those views we call you a
[02:12:14.980 --> 02:12:18.820]  cook but since you're a radical Islamist you're not coming here because
[02:12:18.820 --> 02:12:23.580]  you're gonna get upset I mean I didn't used to believe it five years ago and
[02:12:23.580 --> 02:12:28.580]  I hear about Sharia law in England in the United States and now in Detroit and
[02:12:28.580 --> 02:12:33.820]  London I mean people selling R rated movies have folks come in and like
[02:12:33.820 --> 02:12:38.900]  ransack their video stores I mean it's just like and they'll walk up to folks
[02:12:38.900 --> 02:12:46.380]  and tell women at night you need to wear you know clothes that are longer and the
[02:12:46.380 --> 02:12:51.180]  left is like oh how sexy oh we love it oh no never call radical Islamist is to
[02:12:51.180 --> 02:12:55.380]  misogynist and it's because you're mentally ill and have a death wish here's
[02:12:55.380 --> 02:12:59.020]  the article MSNBC shills for Planned Parenthood a second damning video is
[02:12:59.020 --> 02:13:03.300]  released footage shows the head of the National Council a medical doctor a
[02:13:03.300 --> 02:13:07.020]  Planned Parenthood smacking her lips drinking wine and talking about a
[02:13:07.020 --> 02:13:10.980]  Lamborghini she's gonna purchase with the organs the organ money from the
[02:13:10.980 --> 02:13:15.580]  babies and how the bigger the baby and the older the baby in unero the higher
[02:13:15.580 --> 02:13:20.220]  the payment can be to even get mothers to start gestating I guess to deliver
[02:13:20.220 --> 02:13:25.060]  them to the termination centers but it's okay because she's a liberal drinking
[02:13:25.060 --> 02:13:30.100]  wine going oh she's real skinny with short hair oh yeah society bows to me
[02:13:30.100 --> 02:13:38.380]  because I go oh I mean it is just total sickening evil on display that is all
[02:13:38.380 --> 02:13:44.940]  coming up I told you about this a few years ago in Germany said it was coming
[02:13:44.940 --> 02:13:50.980]  to the U.S. in Seattle they're doing away with single family homes they're
[02:13:50.980 --> 02:13:57.340]  banning new ones being built that's a gender 21 tyranny through zoning we
[02:13:57.340 --> 02:14:00.340]  told you that was coming we were crazy cooks we told you they were gonna try to
[02:14:00.340 --> 02:14:06.340]  restrict families from having children with new taxes that's now being announced
[02:14:06.340 --> 02:14:11.020]  we told you to have tax boxes in the cars track you by the mile and tax you
[02:14:11.020 --> 02:14:15.540]  that's all now being announced in Washington state of course that's one
[02:14:15.540 --> 02:14:19.820]  of the new beta testing centers they've already collapsed California so they're
[02:14:19.820 --> 02:14:29.700]  moving on this is the program this is the plan this is how they take over they
[02:14:29.700 --> 02:14:32.740]  don't want you being alone they don't want you being able to have privacy
[02:14:32.740 --> 02:14:37.340]  they want you in big giant compact Warren Buffett owned high rises where they
[02:14:37.340 --> 02:14:40.460]  can gouge the daylight side of you and raise taxes higher and higher on you and
[02:14:40.460 --> 02:14:46.540]  you can't escape so that's coming up as well there's lots of propaganda pieces
[02:14:46.540 --> 02:14:49.780]  out as they get ready for this big global government announcement for carbon
[02:14:49.780 --> 02:14:52.940]  taxes as world temperatures decline they're announcing with their record
[02:14:52.940 --> 02:14:57.420]  high levels and the polar bears are all dying a submarine launches under siege
[02:14:57.420 --> 02:15:01.340]  drone in a first for US Navy you believe that's the first time they've launched
[02:15:01.340 --> 02:15:06.900]  undersea drones I'm a jet pilot from Pluto
[02:15:06.900 --> 02:15:12.340]  new study shows probability of obese people reaching normal weight less than
[02:15:12.340 --> 02:15:19.700]  1% that's just some of the news we're gonna be going over but first off we're
[02:15:19.700 --> 02:15:25.300]  joined by Anthony Uchiarty who I drug in here to help me do a plug for our newest
[02:15:25.300 --> 02:15:30.940]  product to join the family of info wars life calm products and that's knockout
[02:15:30.940 --> 02:15:34.580]  now we did a limited run of this so there's really no need to even plug it
[02:15:34.580 --> 02:15:39.020]  because it'll be sold out in a week we are sold out a super male vitality we're
[02:15:39.020 --> 02:15:43.960]  about to sell out of survival shield nasa and iodine x2 we have plenty of
[02:15:43.960 --> 02:15:47.340]  prostate guard because it sold out so quick last time we ordered a lot of it
[02:15:47.340 --> 02:15:52.620]  it is the highest quality prostate formula out there and obviously just
[02:15:52.620 --> 02:15:55.700]  doesn't help the prostate but the government actually admits the saw
[02:15:55.700 --> 02:15:58.900]  palmetto and other things that are in it are good for the prostate but it's good
[02:15:58.900 --> 02:16:01.820]  for a lot of things we're talking about that with Anthony Uchiarty briefly as
[02:16:01.820 --> 02:16:06.340]  well but first off knockout tell folks how we set about to create this and why
[02:16:06.340 --> 02:16:11.660]  it's so exciting I'm exciting very excited about it I have trouble sleeping
[02:16:11.660 --> 02:16:16.540]  sometimes especially since I've lost a lot of weight and my kids wake up
[02:16:16.540 --> 02:16:19.860]  sometimes so then once I wake up I've trouble going back to sleep I've told
[02:16:19.860 --> 02:16:22.980]  the story where I'm on coast to coast a m till 3 4 in the morning or other
[02:16:22.980 --> 02:16:28.100]  overnight shows that I just can't go to bed at 3 or 4 I end up staying up till
[02:16:28.100 --> 02:16:33.260]  5 or 6 then my kids get up at 6 30 or 7 I've gotten an hour of sleep not with
[02:16:33.260 --> 02:16:36.980]  knockout I can take this because we've had it for about six months before we
[02:16:36.980 --> 02:16:41.020]  actually got a manufacturer we have the testers I can take knockout 30 minutes
[02:16:41.020 --> 02:16:45.820]  before I'm done working and then it starts hitting and I'm telling you within
[02:16:45.820 --> 02:16:50.940]  an hour of taking it sometimes 45 minutes I can't stay awake simply amazing I
[02:16:50.940 --> 02:16:54.540]  can take it at 9 o'clock at night if I want to go to bed at 10 and the reason
[02:16:54.540 --> 02:17:00.860]  we developed this was because I said you know I got to take sometimes I take
[02:17:00.860 --> 02:17:03.660]  melatonin it quits working if I take valerian it quits working I take them
[02:17:03.660 --> 02:17:07.140]  together it has mixed results I want something that's got everything in it
[02:17:07.140 --> 02:17:11.140]  known to work together without side effects to knock me out let me tell you
[02:17:11.140 --> 02:17:16.020]  it knocks this guy out it takes a lot to knock me out I've told the story it
[02:17:16.020 --> 02:17:19.740]  took him double the curary to put me under four months ago when I had surgery
[02:17:19.740 --> 02:17:24.740]  took them nine times with conventional opiate based anesthesia is when I was
[02:17:24.740 --> 02:17:29.140]  16 nine times they conducted an investigation because of it and blood
[02:17:29.140 --> 02:17:32.580]  tested me thinking I've been on opiates or something which I wasn't have that
[02:17:32.580 --> 02:17:37.340]  tolerance so this stuff knocks me out and figures you already tell us about
[02:17:37.340 --> 02:17:41.300]  knockout so knockouts really unique and I think really it was made for you over
[02:17:41.300 --> 02:17:43.860]  anyone else because you have so much trouble sleeping like you were just
[02:17:43.860 --> 02:17:47.580]  telling everyone and you used to say hey I take melatonin it works sometimes and
[02:17:47.580 --> 02:17:51.420]  it does work sometimes I'm gonna break down why it may not be working and it
[02:17:51.420 --> 02:17:54.020]  is good and we do have it in this formula we do have a good dose of
[02:17:54.020 --> 02:17:58.780]  melatonin okay but melatonin is a hormone it's made by the pineal gland and it
[02:17:58.780 --> 02:18:02.060]  just tells your body when to wake up when to sleep it's you know part of your
[02:18:02.060 --> 02:18:05.420]  rhythm section in your brain where wake up when the sun comes up you go to sleep
[02:18:05.420 --> 02:18:08.900]  when it goes down but sometimes when you just kind of put that hormone in there
[02:18:08.900 --> 02:18:12.500]  it doesn't totally work with the body so that's why we like to take the natural
[02:18:12.500 --> 02:18:17.060]  approach that's why we have L tryptophan in there okay and L tryptophan
[02:18:17.060 --> 02:18:22.220]  stuff is in Turkey right it's in all meats and you actually get only a very
[02:18:22.220 --> 02:18:26.660]  very small amount of it in meat and fruit so what happens is it's the biochemical
[02:18:26.660 --> 02:18:31.340]  precursor to serotonin and serotonin here's where it's unique it can naturally
[02:18:31.340 --> 02:18:36.820]  be converted by the body into melatonin so as always with info wars life we're
[02:18:36.820 --> 02:18:39.820]  trying to give the body what it needs to do its own thing instead of just
[02:18:39.820 --> 02:18:44.060]  attacking it with different ingredients that sometimes do work we're using things
[02:18:44.060 --> 02:18:47.940]  like L tryptophan and it's interesting to note that if you look up L tryptophan
[02:18:47.940 --> 02:18:52.860]  it's so powerful one of the things that they did was in the 90s they had this
[02:18:52.860 --> 02:18:56.100]  company had imported a bunch of it from Japan and China and it was
[02:18:56.100 --> 02:19:00.260]  contaminated and that gave L tryptophan a bad name and the FDA actually banned it
[02:19:00.260 --> 02:19:04.580]  for a period of time and everyone freaked out about it this is US based L
[02:19:04.580 --> 02:19:08.980]  tryptophan as always US based and of course we have valerian root extract
[02:19:08.980 --> 02:19:12.780]  which is my personal favorite if we go back to ancient Greece and ancient Rome
[02:19:12.780 --> 02:19:18.220]  Galen actually said this was his cure for this is from ancient Greece ancient
[02:19:18.220 --> 02:19:22.500]  Rome traditionally used he prescribed it as a remedy for insomnia of course he
[02:19:22.500 --> 02:19:25.540]  was a prominent Greek physician so this has been used for thousands and
[02:19:25.540 --> 02:19:29.020]  thousands of years but most sleep formulas this is my biggest issue we'll
[02:19:29.020 --> 02:19:33.660]  just have melatonin it'll be the same price as knockout so this is $19 for
[02:19:33.660 --> 02:19:36.860]  the same price as many just plain melatonin supplements has lemon balm
[02:19:36.860 --> 02:19:41.460]  gabba melatonin L tryptophan valerian root extract and more so it and no

[02:24:26.340 --> 02:24:31.100]  of it the last week really breaking the news drudge linking to it forcing the
[02:24:31.100 --> 02:24:34.900]  mainstream media to cover it over the weekend that they're going to use
[02:24:34.900 --> 02:24:40.620]  systems that are secret from the VA where they determine whose guns to
[02:24:40.620 --> 02:24:44.980]  basically take from veterans well now they're going to use that on social
[02:24:44.980 --> 02:24:50.940]  security recipients we see this model where oh you get welfare we're going to
[02:24:50.940 --> 02:24:57.340]  force inoculations on you oh you get a government tax credit for kids we're
[02:24:57.340 --> 02:25:03.700]  going to force inoculations on you oh you're on social security disability for
[02:25:03.700 --> 02:25:11.580]  physical or mental maybe you've gotten narcolepsy can't have guns so that's
[02:25:11.580 --> 02:25:18.300]  where this is going very very serious that's in the next segment finishing up
[02:25:18.300 --> 02:25:24.500]  Anthony Gutiarty prostiguard is really an amazing formula and people are
[02:25:24.500 --> 02:25:29.900]  freaking out over it it's like knockout it has everything in it known to help
[02:25:29.900 --> 02:25:37.380]  the prostate and that's why it's so popular and on top of it it's at a low
[02:25:37.380 --> 02:25:41.340]  price right and you know you talk about salt on meadow which is super powerful
[02:25:41.340 --> 02:25:44.460]  and super important and even the myoclinic has great things to say about
[02:25:44.460 --> 02:25:47.860]  it even the US government has great things to say about it but as always
[02:25:47.860 --> 02:25:50.780]  with these products we're looking beyond that because that's been a staple for a
[02:25:50.780 --> 02:25:55.500]  long time but then we look at things like lycopene or plant sterols and those
[02:25:55.500 --> 02:25:59.220]  are on the forefront of the new salt palmetto so as always kind of like with
[02:25:59.220 --> 02:26:03.380]  knockout we're looking at sure here's the staple traditional use of a super
[02:26:03.380 --> 02:26:07.100]  powerful herb or a compound or whatever but we're looking 10 years in the future
[02:26:07.100 --> 02:26:10.900]  what's going to be the next salt palmetto and that is of course lycopene or
[02:26:10.900 --> 02:26:14.380]  the plant sterols so we're going to put those in there now and then in 10 years
[02:26:14.380 --> 02:26:17.820]  this is going to be the foundation for the additional you know formulations
[02:26:17.820 --> 02:26:21.140]  that others are doing this is what has been the thread over and over again I
[02:26:21.140 --> 02:26:23.900]  mean look at the nascent iodine how many nascent iodine products are out there
[02:26:23.900 --> 02:26:27.620]  now even if you just Google nascent iodine it used to be barren we used to
[02:26:27.620 --> 02:26:31.100]  just dominate it now how many competitors are out there trying to
[02:26:31.100 --> 02:26:34.820]  imitate it right they're not going to be able to imitate it but how many are out
[02:26:34.820 --> 02:26:37.700]  there trying to imitate these things that's why it's always important to be
[02:26:37.700 --> 02:26:41.900]  on the cutting edge and looking at the research on PubMed national library
[02:26:41.900 --> 02:26:45.940]  medicine national library of congress medicine because you need to know what
[02:26:45.940 --> 02:26:49.780]  is going to be the big thing in 5 to 10 because most supplement manufacturers are
[02:26:49.780 --> 02:26:53.540]  lazy they're not into it they're not trying to put out something cutting edge
[02:26:53.540 --> 02:26:57.740]  they're just marketers who hire some really sexy models and really glitzy TV
[02:26:57.740 --> 02:27:02.580]  advertising that's why all the real big supplement folks I don't want to call
[02:27:02.580 --> 02:27:05.260]  them foodies people that love good food are called foodies what do you call
[02:27:05.260 --> 02:27:10.060]  supplement folks smart people the facilities we use the three big labs we
[02:27:10.060 --> 02:27:13.700]  use love us because we'll actually put together a high quality product and
[02:27:13.700 --> 02:27:19.380]  actually pay for it so they appreciate that but it's really simple if all these
[02:27:19.380 --> 02:27:23.020]  things are good if they all work together why not put them all in one pill
[02:27:23.020 --> 02:27:27.540]  now some of its cutting edge like knockout or prostagard in the case of
[02:27:27.540 --> 02:27:33.380]  x2 we just went and got a deeper source of iodine so it's the strongest purest
[02:27:33.380 --> 02:27:37.460]  out there and it has a better effect that it's not in the alcohol that seems
[02:27:37.460 --> 02:27:42.140]  to bind with iodine and we believe from our research make it not nascent or not
[02:27:42.140 --> 02:27:45.860]  atomically charged to go through all the science where it's able to be absorbed
[02:27:45.860 --> 02:27:51.340]  by the body I mean we made iodine popular nobody else was pushing this now as
[02:27:51.340 --> 02:27:55.740]  you said there's always competitors who are even mad at us because they're too
[02:27:55.740 --> 02:27:59.420]  lazy to go figure out how to get deep earth crystals I mean I'm sure they could
[02:27:59.420 --> 02:28:04.980]  do it and they're too lazy to not stick it in you know other things like alcohol
[02:28:04.980 --> 02:28:08.620]  that ruin it I mean look I was taking iodine it was giving me stomach aches
[02:28:08.620 --> 02:28:12.540]  it was giving more energy I was losing weight so I went out and developed with
[02:28:12.540 --> 02:28:17.700]  group in a palm oil organic base where it's injected in and a patented system
[02:28:17.700 --> 02:28:23.020]  with Russian technology as a gas and it doesn't hurt my stomach and it turns
[02:28:23.020 --> 02:28:28.500]  bright blue on paper because that's the color of iodine crystals is electric
[02:28:28.500 --> 02:28:34.020]  purple not red and again I don't want to get into it all we've had chemists look
[02:28:34.020 --> 02:28:38.700]  at it something weird is happening when iodine especially from an ocean source
[02:28:38.700 --> 02:28:43.420]  is added into alcohol it just turns it into grunge you know I would equate it
[02:28:43.420 --> 02:28:47.100]  to we have these three manufacturers right and we're always I would equate
[02:28:47.100 --> 02:28:51.340]  them to being Albert Einstein okay as an example and most people are going up to
[02:28:51.340 --> 02:28:55.100]  Albert Einstein saying what's three plus three what's three plus three that's the
[02:28:55.100 --> 02:28:58.260]  other people making their supplements right but what's the cheapest yeah it was
[02:28:58.260 --> 02:29:01.060]  the cheapest thing spending 10 cents but I'm saying we're giving him these
[02:29:01.060 --> 02:29:04.740]  algorithms and we're making him solve them these chemists are so excited about
[02:29:04.740 --> 02:29:07.580]  us because we're so interesting we're always pushing the bar you know we're
[02:29:07.580 --> 02:29:10.340]  always spending the money on the research they're excited about it as
[02:29:10.340 --> 02:29:14.100]  opposed to these other companies many new companies also by the way popping up
[02:29:14.100 --> 02:29:17.260]  you know spamming everybody with ads and stuff like that and they just take
[02:29:17.260 --> 02:29:20.620]  the temperate 10 cent bottle stuff that I see all the time I see well I mean
[02:29:20.620 --> 02:29:24.220]  exactly but beyond that most big manufacturers they only want one or two
[02:29:24.220 --> 02:29:28.820]  ingredients because then they never have a supply chain problem that too we put
[02:29:28.820 --> 02:29:33.460]  you know 10 things in each product or more and we cold press the supermails
[02:29:33.460 --> 02:29:38.580]  for female fatality much more expensive we use the raw fresh herbs because we
[02:29:38.580 --> 02:29:41.820]  really want to be the best and it does cause supply problems but it doesn't
[02:29:41.820 --> 02:29:45.020]  matter we're still the best and our market share is growing free market
[02:29:45.020 --> 02:29:48.900]  ideas it's funding the info war it's beautiful info wars life comm to
[02:29:48.900 --> 02:29:56.620]  show yours thank you Anthony's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[02:29:58.300 --> 02:30:02.700]  economic upheaval has enveloped the European Union this year as a result of
[02:30:02.700 --> 02:30:06.020]  bailout practices that have done nothing but make these countries more in
[02:30:06.020 --> 02:30:09.740]  solvent well French president Francois Hollande has proposed a solution he
[02:30:09.740 --> 02:30:13.020]  recently suggested that every member of the eurozone transfer all their
[02:30:13.020 --> 02:30:15.940]  sovereignty to a newly created federal government in other words it would
[02:30:15.940 --> 02:30:18.940]  essentially be a united states of Europe the government would have a prime
[02:30:18.940 --> 02:30:22.180]  minister a parliament a federal budget and a federal treasury that's a pretty
[02:30:22.180 --> 02:30:25.860]  good suggestion since your original eurozone bureaucracy and parliament
[02:30:25.860 --> 02:30:28.820]  didn't do anything to help these financial crises except make the banks
[02:30:28.820 --> 02:30:32.340]  richer let's create another big bureaucracy that we can feed money into
[02:30:32.340 --> 02:30:35.620]  therefore kicking the can down the road just a little bit farther Michael

[02:34:37.060 --> 02:34:41.980]  on info wars.com this is actually in the New York magazine feminist not
[02:34:41.980 --> 02:34:46.980]  allowing your wife to sleep with other men is sexist but it's not good for you
[02:34:46.980 --> 02:34:53.300]  to do it yeah the dad stays home and takes care of the kids while mom goes
[02:34:53.300 --> 02:34:57.700]  out and has two sexual partners a week I'm not kidding she'll tell me about how
[02:34:57.700 --> 02:35:04.940]  she had sex with Paulo and I'm glad because I'm a feminist know what you
[02:35:04.940 --> 02:35:08.300]  are is a dominated idiot and statistically your marriage will end and
[02:35:08.300 --> 02:35:13.660]  your kids will end up completely unhappy but that's the type of news up on
[02:35:13.660 --> 02:35:20.900]  info wars.com it's all designed to make us dumb dependent worldly stupid easily
[02:35:20.900 --> 02:35:27.860]  controllable morons who have no values so we'll stand for nothing this is
[02:35:27.860 --> 02:35:37.020]  scientifically focused it's over the top now it was last Friday that I saw an
[02:35:37.020 --> 02:35:40.940]  article in the Daily Caller linked up at drubsreport.com and I knew this was
[02:35:40.940 --> 02:35:47.420]  coming but there it was Obama has promised upwards of 20 initiatives that
[02:35:47.420 --> 02:35:51.220]  he didn't announce he just said we've got as many as 20 initiative 20
[02:35:51.220 --> 02:35:55.700]  initiatives earlier this year that he would start announcing later this year
[02:35:55.700 --> 02:36:02.180]  well it's now later this year gun import bans restrictions on bullets
[02:36:02.180 --> 02:36:09.020]  supporting groups suing gun manufacturers trying to put local databases
[02:36:09.020 --> 02:36:16.140]  through the NIC system and then designating people unable to own guns
[02:36:16.140 --> 02:36:22.020]  who are not restricted under the 68 gun control act it says if you've been
[02:36:22.020 --> 02:36:27.580]  declared mentally incompetent or are a felon or have a restraining order against
[02:36:27.580 --> 02:36:36.500]  you for domestic violence that you can't own or buy a gun at that time and they
[02:36:36.500 --> 02:36:41.060]  have selectively enforced this they have misapplied it the Brady bill got
[02:36:41.060 --> 02:36:47.660]  struck down because of it at the Supreme Court the problem is that we know the
[02:36:47.660 --> 02:36:57.220]  model is the VA and the VA for now about 16 17 years since the end of the
[02:36:57.220 --> 02:37:01.300]  Clinton administration through Bush now really bad under Obama it's intensified
[02:37:01.300 --> 02:37:06.540]  have put over a million veterans on a no-buy list and most the time it's
[02:37:06.540 --> 02:37:11.140]  because they collapsed and had heat stroke and they call it ptsd or they've
[02:37:11.140 --> 02:37:18.620]  had arms or legs blown off or they have a brain injury and have a speech
[02:37:18.620 --> 02:37:22.020]  impediment well that's exactly who needs to have a gun is somebody with no
[02:37:22.020 --> 02:37:25.580]  criminal record who got an arm or a leg blown off and who has a side of their
[02:37:25.580 --> 02:37:33.540]  face blown off so they can't be preyed upon by predators I mean it's handicap
[02:37:33.540 --> 02:37:36.820]  folks oh I use a politically incorrect term but it's okay to disarm them just
[02:37:36.820 --> 02:37:42.540]  just just just say disabled see how they replace rights with just a bunch of foe
[02:37:42.540 --> 02:37:48.020]  papering over to get you diverted you know aboard all the black babies 52% of
[02:37:48.020 --> 02:37:51.340]  blacks are aborted but you know ban the rebel flag is nothing to do with slavery
[02:37:51.340 --> 02:37:58.500]  this is the mind control and sure enough here's the article Obama pushes to end
[02:37:58.500 --> 02:38:04.820]  gun background checks Obama pushes to extend I had a 40 and slip Obama pushes
[02:38:04.820 --> 02:38:10.900]  to extend gun background checks to social security and it goes on to say
[02:38:10.900 --> 02:38:15.020]  there's no simple way to identify that group but a strategy used by the
[02:38:15.020 --> 02:38:18.860]  Department of Veterans Affairs since the creation of the background check system
[02:38:18.860 --> 02:38:24.220]  is reporting anyone who's been declared incompetent to manage their pension or
[02:38:24.220 --> 02:38:30.660]  disability payments and assigned a fiduciary boom so you have a fiduciary
[02:38:30.660 --> 02:38:34.540]  might be your lawyer might be your bank banker you trust might be your dad
[02:38:34.540 --> 02:38:41.820]  your mom your mother your father your son your daughter and so you got your arm
[02:38:41.820 --> 02:38:46.260]  blown off your leg blown off you've got an injury it's not mental now see and
[02:38:46.260 --> 02:38:51.340]  we knew this they're just coming in and and I mean I know lots of veterans I
[02:38:51.340 --> 02:38:55.300]  know a famous football player was a UT football player than an NFL football
[02:38:55.300 --> 02:38:59.660]  player didn't want me to say his name on air but I met him at a birthday party a
[02:38:59.660 --> 02:39:03.140]  few years ago and I looked him up I'm not a huge football follower but I even knew
[02:39:03.140 --> 02:39:10.940]  who he was and he's a grandfather now no criminal record but in Vietnam he was
[02:39:10.940 --> 02:39:14.860]  at UT got out of UT went to Vietnam for two tours and then went join the NFL
[02:39:14.860 --> 02:39:18.580]  he's pretty famous but the point is he went to buy his 10-year-old grandson a
[02:39:18.580 --> 02:39:22.740]  20-year rifle hadn't bought a gun in a long time you already had guns and they
[02:39:22.740 --> 02:39:26.540]  said sorry you can't buy that you've been put on a list and he went back and
[02:39:26.540 --> 02:39:33.020]  couldn't find out exactly but he'd had heat stroke in Vietnam and had been in
[02:39:33.020 --> 02:39:36.300]  the hospital for a week from it
[02:39:36.580 --> 02:39:43.140]  heat exhaustion and they just said well that could have been PTSD so just it's
[02:39:43.140 --> 02:39:47.580]  probably that you can't buy guns anymore and we might actually come take them
[02:39:47.580 --> 02:39:52.820]  from you well now the coming and taking is gonna begin so here's the headline
[02:39:52.820 --> 02:39:57.060]  from Patrick Howley investigative reporter on the political beat for
[02:39:57.060 --> 02:40:03.540]  dailycaller.com ATF works with FBI and VA to get veterans guns taken away and
[02:40:03.540 --> 02:40:09.180]  he joins us to break this down I saw the Daily Caller reporting on it last week
[02:40:09.180 --> 02:40:13.300]  they're reporting on it more finding details today but this is no judge no
[02:40:13.300 --> 02:40:19.100]  jury no nothing a lot of folks are in a car rack they'll tell you oh go to a
[02:40:19.100 --> 02:40:23.020]  psychologist they'll say you know I think you have PTSD we're gonna pay for
[02:40:23.020 --> 02:40:28.820]  these psychology meetings or if you get a divorce generally it's the woman side
[02:40:28.820 --> 02:40:34.300]  they'll get up and say we like to call for family evaluation and for counseling
[02:40:34.300 --> 02:40:38.980]  for the children and both parents and the court loves that because it's tens of
[02:40:38.980 --> 02:40:43.360]  thousands of dollars a year for both parties and then it signs on and then
[02:40:43.360 --> 02:40:46.540]  you're in the system there and it's like you know how about we just say I see
[02:40:46.540 --> 02:40:50.260]  this on the news all the time let's just say you have PTSD from this divorce how
[02:40:50.260 --> 02:40:53.700]  would you like to get all this paid for on your insurance boom your guns are
[02:40:53.700 --> 02:40:59.020]  gone so they get everybody trapped first on the system not telling you then
[02:40:59.020 --> 02:41:03.540]  this happens so this is the biggest strike the biggest attack on the second
[02:41:03.540 --> 02:41:09.620]  amendment I've ever seen and it's been done just as a no big deal routine kind
[02:41:09.620 --> 02:41:13.300]  of like Planned Parenthood new videos out with their their national director of
[02:41:13.300 --> 02:41:17.940]  their council that's like their vice chairman this female doctor is on tape
[02:41:17.940 --> 02:41:21.420]  going yeah I want to buy a Lamborghini and we want the lowest price on these
[02:41:21.420 --> 02:41:27.820]  body parts for the organ harvesting and she just matter of fact calling it the
[02:41:27.820 --> 02:41:33.820]  supplies we need the supplies can you get us the supplies can you get us the
[02:41:33.820 --> 02:41:38.060]  product it's the same thing here yeah we got to get these bitter clingers we're
[02:41:38.060 --> 02:41:41.620]  not gonna stop the illegal aliens having guns or criminals or open borders you
[02:41:41.620 --> 02:41:44.740]  know we're just gonna go we've been going after the veterans now it's gonna be
[02:41:44.740 --> 02:41:50.340]  the old people so they can be preyed upon so joining us is Patrick Howley
[02:41:50.340 --> 02:41:55.380]  Patrick I tell you this is bold this is bold and of course they're gonna
[02:41:55.380 --> 02:41:59.660]  camels nose under the tent flap like to did with Clinton and the vets but this
[02:41:59.660 --> 02:42:04.420]  is intensifying the vets just complain yes suddenly I can't buy guns then you
[02:42:04.420 --> 02:42:08.940]  get in New York California in Illinois where they're more bold they have the
[02:42:08.940 --> 02:42:13.180]  state federally funded task forces they come and say hey up but only we trouble
[02:42:13.180 --> 02:42:17.220]  we're just taking your guns we're taking in for psychological evaluation don't
[02:42:17.220 --> 02:42:23.540]  give us trouble or we're gonna have to arrest you your medical record show that
[02:42:23.540 --> 02:42:28.020]  you were given a designation 20 years ago 10 years ago five years ago and it's
[02:42:28.020 --> 02:42:33.780]  not that you even are mentally ill or considered violent it's that you just
[02:42:33.780 --> 02:42:36.980]  had some type of psychological counseling I mean this is so draconian
[02:42:36.980 --> 02:42:40.580]  you've really ferreted into this you've really dug into this what can you tell
[02:42:40.580 --> 02:42:44.900]  us well first of all thanks for having me and thanks for highlighting this
[02:42:44.900 --> 02:42:48.980]  issue because a lot of publications wouldn't the Los Angeles Times picked it
[02:42:48.980 --> 02:42:53.940]  up just recently but a few weeks ago essentially I started this off by
[02:42:53.940 --> 02:42:57.820]  obtaining a memo through a source from inside the Federal Bureau of
[02:42:57.820 --> 02:43:04.300]  Investigation showing that the FBI and they broke this down every month the
[02:43:04.300 --> 02:43:09.620]  Department of Veterans Affairs sends a CD-ROM disc with the names new names each
[02:43:09.620 --> 02:43:14.020]  month of veterans who they feel should be on the national instant criminal
[02:43:14.020 --> 02:43:18.340]  background check list now these are people who did not commit crimes these
[02:43:18.340 --> 02:43:21.340]  are not criminals these are not people who should be on the national instant
[02:43:21.340 --> 02:43:25.620]  criminal background check system but these are people who the VA has determined
[02:43:25.620 --> 02:43:30.260]  through their own counseling services and their own VA health services so if
[02:43:30.260 --> 02:43:33.700]  these veterans actually do manage to get off the secret paper waiting lists and
[02:43:33.700 --> 02:43:38.980]  get in to the facilities to get a real doctor's appointment they just might say
[02:43:38.980 --> 02:43:43.700]  something or do something that will set off the VA will put them on the list the
[02:43:43.700 --> 02:43:49.300]  FBI does not review these cases the FBI does not investigate these cases the
[02:43:49.300 --> 02:43:54.940]  FBI merely takes the CD-ROM disc from the VA and immediately puts these people on
[02:43:54.940 --> 02:44:00.820]  the national instant criminal background check system and it's up to the VA so we
[02:44:00.820 --> 02:44:04.820]  know that the FBI and the VA are working together on this hundreds of thousands
[02:44:04.820 --> 02:44:07.780]  of veterans have been put on the national instant criminal background check
[02:44:07.780 --> 02:44:12.700]  system without their knowledge for things such as you know switching their
[02:44:12.700 --> 02:44:17.300]  bank account to auto pay debit card they don't want to cash a paycheck because
[02:44:17.300 --> 02:44:22.340]  nobody does anymore so they just have the their pension and benefits put
[02:44:22.340 --> 02:44:26.100]  directly onto their debit card so that is enough to get you on to the list
[02:44:26.100 --> 02:44:31.540]  having a nurse in your house to cook for household tours if you're old or
[02:44:31.540 --> 02:44:34.780]  injured that's enough to get you on the list as far as I'm concerned that those
[02:44:34.780 --> 02:44:37.860]  are the kind of people who need guns because you know if somebody breaks into
[02:44:37.860 --> 02:44:41.220]  their house but that's enough to get you on to the list let me just stop you this
[02:44:41.220 --> 02:44:44.700]  is incredible you have the FBI memo you've linked to it in your articles you
[02:44:44.700 --> 02:44:47.540]  broke this story I think it's important to point that out I said the Bayley
[02:44:47.540 --> 02:44:52.260]  Caller did you did great job there they're trying to get rid of investigative
[02:44:52.260 --> 02:44:56.900]  journalists that actually dig into the meat here so my interpretation watching
[02:44:56.900 --> 02:45:01.180]  this since Clinton's time is dead on to what the memo says they just use
[02:45:01.180 --> 02:45:06.220]  anything the fact that a nurse comes and sees you twice a week the fact that
[02:45:06.220 --> 02:45:09.420]  you've got enough money to have a lady that comes and cooks for you some or a
[02:45:09.420 --> 02:45:14.260]  maid a helper I mean that's what we all hope we can have in world this is just
[02:45:14.260 --> 02:45:18.380]  wild to say you're incompetent you shouldn't have a gun and they've got a
[02:45:18.380 --> 02:45:22.940]  bunch of politically motivated socialists and others in their tasks with
[02:45:22.940 --> 02:45:28.900]  doing this no judge no jury no nothing you just can't get a gun and now the new
[02:45:28.900 --> 02:45:34.420]  phase is they're coming to take the guns I mean this is the gun confiscation of
[02:45:34.420 --> 02:45:39.020]  the veterans and now it's going to be the social security crowd but don't think
[02:45:39.020 --> 02:45:46.580]  that the AARP is going to say a word please continue the AARP is definitely
[02:45:46.580 --> 02:45:51.340]  on board with the Obama agenda 100% I mean they're one of his biggest
[02:45:51.340 --> 02:45:54.460]  supporters the funny thing is and it's not funny but I use that term in a dark
[02:45:54.460 --> 02:45:59.380]  way is that a lot of these things like having a nurse or switching your payments
[02:45:59.380 --> 02:46:03.340]  to debit or all these trivial things that get people on the list were suggested
[02:46:03.340 --> 02:46:10.340]  to the veterans by the VA I've talked about who said I didn't need a nurse to
[02:46:10.340 --> 02:46:14.100]  come by the VA said you do need a nurse we've decided that you need a nurse
[02:46:14.100 --> 02:46:17.660]  we're going to give you one the veteran says okay and then the VA puts them down
[02:46:17.660 --> 02:46:21.300]  on the list now they have a nurse so it's the VA actually driving these
[02:46:21.300 --> 02:46:27.260]  numbers but you know now as we know my source has come back with even more
[02:46:27.260 --> 02:46:32.300]  documents and found that ATF is now involved ATF is now working behind the
[02:46:32.300 --> 02:46:39.100]  scenes with the FBI on enforcing these cases ATF I mean your viewers know ATF
[02:46:39.100 --> 02:46:44.300]  very well this is the enforcement arm so we know that the FBI and the VA has
[02:46:44.300 --> 02:46:47.740]  been putting these people on the list now that they're on the list ATF knows
[02:46:47.740 --> 02:46:52.620]  about it and ATF can come and knock on your door and they're gonna have guns
[02:46:52.620 --> 02:46:57.380]  when they come so they're clearly from your research correct me am I wrong I've
[02:46:57.380 --> 02:47:00.780]  read your series of articles they're gearing up is what you're saying this
[02:47:00.780 --> 02:47:05.180]  is a major offensive oh absolutely and especially the fact that they're going
[02:47:05.180 --> 02:47:08.740]  after the Social Security Administration now every single person in this
[02:47:08.740 --> 02:47:12.820]  country who gets Social Security benefits which is basically everyone
[02:47:12.820 --> 02:47:17.540]  everyone I know over a certain age who is in the Social Security system anything
[02:47:17.540 --> 02:47:21.660]  you say related to the Social Security Administration anything you put down in
[02:47:21.660 --> 02:47:26.340]  your medical records that can now be used against you to send ATF agents to
[02:47:26.340 --> 02:47:30.460]  your house to take away your guns and President Obama who's in the last days
[02:47:30.460 --> 02:47:34.260]  of his presidency and he was a media who doesn't report on this kind of thing
[02:47:34.260 --> 02:47:37.900]  um you know it's just gonna start enforcing this and what can people do
[02:47:37.900 --> 02:47:41.740]  they can they can write to you Alex or they can write to me or they can write
[02:47:41.740 --> 02:47:45.540]  to another journalist and said hey I had an ATF agent come to my house but
[02:47:45.540 --> 02:47:48.940]  that's not going to be page one in the New York Times you know Obama's not
[02:47:48.940 --> 02:47:52.860]  going to see any political consequences for this but the crackdown is starting
[02:47:52.860 --> 02:47:58.220]  now that's right the the crackdown on Social Security recipients having their
[02:47:58.220 --> 02:48:03.380]  guns taken is accelerating I remember the headline two years ago in Bloomberg
[02:48:03.380 --> 02:48:08.460]  gun confiscation begins in California that's not an info wars dot com headline
[02:48:08.460 --> 02:48:12.660]  or a daily caller dot com headline or something on drudge report dot com that
[02:48:12.660 --> 02:48:18.740]  is their words to condition people and it's like veterans that can't take care
[02:48:18.740 --> 02:48:23.580]  of themselves or who are mentally ill and then you find out it's in some of
[02:48:23.580 --> 02:48:26.940]  the cases I've seen it'll be like a 25 year old vet that has both his legs
[02:48:26.940 --> 02:48:33.300]  blown off and they go you know you're too depressed to have a 45 you know 9-11
[02:48:33.300 --> 02:48:41.460]  1911 well that's exactly who needs to have a gun I mean I'm 41 and I've gotten
[02:48:41.460 --> 02:48:45.300]  the point where if some thug tries to attack me I've got a gun in my car I'm
[02:48:45.300 --> 02:48:48.180]  just gonna shoot him I'm not gonna fight him I was 18 I might have just fought
[02:48:48.180 --> 02:48:51.460]  him I could probably still beat him but I'm not gonna give him that chance if
[02:48:51.460 --> 02:48:55.340]  they're assaulting me with my children I've got a job to stay alive well
[02:48:55.340 --> 02:48:59.660]  imagine if I if I had an arm and a leg blown off or both legs blown off or was
[02:48:59.660 --> 02:49:04.300]  paralyzed chest down those people need to be protected this is outrageous
[02:49:04.300 --> 02:49:10.700]  praying on old people and veterans it's just despicable oh of course it is and
[02:49:10.700 --> 02:49:15.180]  it reflects tremendous contempt on the part of the progressive establishment
[02:49:15.180 --> 02:49:20.260]  the progress of elite and let's be clear they are the elite when it when it
[02:49:20.260 --> 02:49:23.460]  comes to veterans when it comes to people who have served this country when
[02:49:23.460 --> 02:49:28.060]  it comes to what they perceive as the radical right or disenfranchised right
[02:49:28.060 --> 02:49:33.540]  wing right men you know they're not doing anything about the cartels coming
[02:49:33.540 --> 02:49:38.340]  over the border there are fast and furious guns being left at crime scenes
[02:49:38.340 --> 02:49:42.620]  here in the United States you know but if one of those people with a fast and
[02:49:42.620 --> 02:49:47.460]  the furious Eric Holder gun comes in and and tries to rob you and you're a 68
[02:49:47.460 --> 02:49:51.300]  year old with no knees because they got blown off in Vietnam maybe you're gonna
[02:49:51.300 --> 02:49:54.660]  end up on this list and you're not gonna be able to have a firearm to protect
[02:49:54.660 --> 02:49:58.020]  yourself I can't tell you how many phone calls I've gotten on air how many
[02:49:58.020 --> 02:50:02.100]  letters I'll start sending them to you or give them to my reporters and how
[02:50:02.100 --> 02:50:06.300]  people I've met in person that go you're telling the truth I went in and I can't
[02:50:06.300 --> 02:50:09.500]  get a gun now and have no criminal record but I'm a veteran they told me it's
[02:50:09.500 --> 02:50:13.860]  something in my record I can't tell you how many people in Texas because of all
[02:50:13.860 --> 02:50:17.780]  these Californians moving in mainly not not in Californians but people that are
[02:50:17.780 --> 02:50:23.180]  socialists and if they hear you shooting on your 200 acre ranch they call the
[02:50:23.180 --> 02:50:27.380]  police on you and the police go well they feel threatened we're taking your
[02:50:27.380 --> 02:50:32.220]  guns so they just roll out this red carpet to anti gunners everywhere so
[02:50:32.220 --> 02:50:36.540]  outside of law outside they're just taking the guns I mean this is a real
[02:50:36.540 --> 02:50:41.780]  line in the sand that they're crossing when you congressional investigations we
[02:50:41.780 --> 02:50:45.460]  need the VA defunded they're already denying healthcare to the vets they're
[02:50:45.460 --> 02:50:49.740]  already putting them on no don't treat death list I mean the VA is a useless
[02:50:49.740 --> 02:50:54.300]  organization and now it's the Social Security Administration is gonna take
[02:50:54.300 --> 02:51:00.020]  this system and the policies and take 65 and up people's guns investors and

[02:54:42.040 --> 02:54:48.980]  emergency they want the guns from the good people I think it's dawning on the
[02:54:48.980 --> 02:54:54.180]  public in fact I know it is the true criminal evil is taking over and they
[02:54:54.180 --> 02:54:57.140]  got some really bad things planned it's why they want to wage war on gun owners
[02:54:57.140 --> 02:55:03.340]  veterans and now they're going to harass with their social workers with their
[02:55:03.340 --> 02:55:08.500]  bureaucrats backed up by the ATF the folks barbecuing little kids at Waco
[02:55:08.500 --> 02:55:13.940]  coming after our guns I want to get Patrick Howley investigative journals
[02:55:13.940 --> 02:55:19.340]  from dailycaller.com on routinely and really beat the drum until it becomes a
[02:55:19.340 --> 02:55:23.100]  national story LA Times picked it up two weeks after he started reporting it I
[02:55:23.100 --> 02:55:27.420]  didn't know about it until a week ago so it just shows how we need to get these
[02:55:27.420 --> 02:55:31.420]  stories out to people I didn't know about this for a week I guess I read his
[02:55:31.420 --> 02:55:35.980]  third or fourth article and posted it on info wars.com we need to get
[02:55:35.980 --> 02:55:42.060]  aggressive because it's on they are coming for the guns not of criminals
[02:55:42.060 --> 02:55:50.700]  they're coming for people 65 and up sir other points need to be made here
[02:55:50.700 --> 02:55:54.380]  there's going to be more shoes to drop what else are you investigating right
[02:55:54.380 --> 02:55:59.580]  now well I mean I just think it's so interesting as you reported on earlier
[02:55:59.580 --> 02:56:03.220]  in the show how we see these armed civilians now taking it upon themselves
[02:56:03.220 --> 02:56:09.340]  to go to these recruitment centers in response to these jihadi threats and you
[02:56:09.340 --> 02:56:12.060]  know defend these recruitment centers because they know that the feds are not
[02:56:12.060 --> 02:56:15.140]  going to do it so I think it's very interesting right now that we see
[02:56:15.140 --> 02:56:20.180]  veterans being targeted for being disarmed we see older people patriotic
[02:56:20.180 --> 02:56:25.660]  people you know so-called right-wing people who are being disarmed just as
[02:56:25.660 --> 02:56:29.420]  we have this situation where jihadis are coming over and shooting people
[02:56:29.420 --> 02:56:34.980]  shooting Marines and forcing citizens to go to these recruitment centers and
[02:56:34.980 --> 02:56:39.060]  stand guard and take it upon themselves and do their patriotic duty to stand
[02:56:39.060 --> 02:56:43.660]  guard and so I think the timing right now is very interesting I think the
[02:56:43.660 --> 02:56:49.180]  timing is especially when you have a White House supported riots in Baltimore
[02:56:49.180 --> 02:56:53.620]  and in Ferguson Missouri and other places around the country that only a
[02:56:53.620 --> 02:56:57.460]  certain kind of people are being targeted for being disarmed the reason
[02:56:57.460 --> 02:57:02.180]  magazine comment section on reason.com was the subject of a department of
[02:57:02.180 --> 02:57:06.180]  justice inquiry where they were trying to find out the names of the commenters
[02:57:06.180 --> 02:57:09.660]  but they're not trying to find out who the cartels are that are running over
[02:57:09.660 --> 02:57:13.740]  the border they're not trying to find out who is burning down the buildings in
[02:57:13.740 --> 02:57:17.700]  Ferguson you know so it's selective prosecution and as we become more and
[02:57:17.700 --> 02:57:21.860]  more as as they stoke the flames of this division and bring us closer and
[02:57:21.860 --> 02:57:27.420]  closer to a violent point God forbid God forbid a violent point they are doing
[02:57:27.420 --> 02:57:31.260]  everything they can to disarm the people who they think are going to be on the
[02:57:31.260 --> 02:57:37.860]  other side. Absolutely I mean it looks like they're trying to run the air's
[02:57:37.860 --> 02:57:41.460]  playbook or the Saul Alinsky playbook and I would always hear that about Obama
[02:57:41.460 --> 02:57:44.780]  eight years ago he was running I was like come on it's not that bad I mean I
[02:57:44.780 --> 02:57:48.940]  didn't like Obama obviously but McCain was horrible too now we really see they
[02:57:48.940 --> 02:57:53.660]  really mean it these are like weirdos 60s communist radicals with nuclear
[02:57:53.660 --> 02:57:57.380]  weapons and they're crazy I mean I remember the famous story if you knew
[02:57:57.380 --> 02:58:00.020]  five more minutes stay with us if you've got to go understand we got a woman at
[02:58:00.020 --> 02:58:04.980]  right but the famous first inauguration of the Clintons Ron Silver the now
[02:58:04.980 --> 02:58:10.020]  deceased Hollywood producer and star was how dare those F-16s fly over so
[02:58:10.020 --> 02:58:13.660]  ignorant so weird you know they're threatening us and Hillary Clinton goes
[02:58:13.660 --> 02:58:19.340]  silver those are our planes now that shows how disconnected but it is they've
[02:58:19.340 --> 02:58:24.380]  dominated they've taken over they run the country they've got the big punchbowl
[02:58:24.380 --> 02:58:29.020]  all of themselves and they just can't help but use it as a porta potty I mean
[02:58:29.020 --> 02:58:32.500]  I hate to use that allegory but I mean these people really are mentally ill
[02:58:32.500 --> 02:58:37.340]  radicals who want to start a civil war they are criminals they are enemies they
[02:58:37.340 --> 02:58:41.460]  are treacherous they are seditious they are insane they are mentally ill they
[02:58:41.460 --> 02:58:45.980]  sell body parts of children they're ghouls I mean they're villains we'll be

[02:59:48.700 --> 02:59:55.660]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[03:00:00.540 --> 03:00:06.260]  from his central texas command center deep behind enemy lines the information
[03:00:06.260 --> 03:00:14.340]  war continues it's alex jones and the gcn radio network I myself have gotten
[03:00:14.340 --> 03:00:18.900]  too comfortable with the tyranny by successive approximation by incrementalism
[03:00:18.900 --> 03:00:23.540]  to where I was just sitting here this weekend going I'm not even this upset
[03:00:23.540 --> 03:00:28.340]  that they're gonna start confiscating it's well over a million vets since
[03:00:28.340 --> 03:00:33.380]  Clinton that have had their guns taken most the time for no reason and then I
[03:00:33.380 --> 03:00:39.060]  saw the LA Times reporting on like it was good they're not even hiding it and
[03:00:39.060 --> 03:00:42.420]  then I realized I've got to make a big deal out of this this week that's what
[03:00:42.420 --> 03:00:45.540]  we're fighting against is the normalization of the bottom dropping
[03:00:45.540 --> 03:00:49.820]  out and just living under total tyranny I've been ranting Patrick Halley you've
[03:00:49.820 --> 03:00:53.060]  got the floor of the last four minutes to go over other points you'd like to
[03:00:53.060 --> 03:00:56.620]  make about this and other things you've got on your radar screen with their
[03:00:56.620 --> 03:01:02.580]  anti-gun push you know this is something that has been in the works for a long
[03:01:02.580 --> 03:01:05.900]  time one of president Obama's major political disappointments was how the
[03:01:05.900 --> 03:01:09.900]  Senate blocked his background checks bill when it came up but through in a
[03:01:09.900 --> 03:01:15.020]  filibuster Ted Cruz thankfully was able to save that from going through and so
[03:01:15.020 --> 03:01:19.140]  he was very unhappy he had the new town families out there and saying this is a
[03:01:19.140 --> 03:01:24.340]  shameful day for the Senate so now that he's in his legacy building mode he is
[03:01:24.340 --> 03:01:30.900]  is really focusing on disarmament and and getting guns away from the kinds of
[03:01:30.900 --> 03:01:36.740]  people that he doesn't want to have guns and you know the gangbangers in
[03:01:36.740 --> 03:01:43.780]  inner cities they have guns okay cartels coming across the border have guns a
[03:01:43.780 --> 03:01:49.180]  lot of people are in the Progressive Coalition have guns but why is it that
[03:01:49.180 --> 03:01:54.020]  veterans and why is it that a certain kind of older more conservative leading
[03:01:54.020 --> 03:01:59.380]  person is now being targeted you know I think that's what you said earlier about
[03:01:59.380 --> 03:02:03.300]  the fact that they always thought that a civil war was gonna occur in this
[03:02:03.300 --> 03:02:08.860]  country or that the civil war is still going on I think that comes straight off
[03:02:08.860 --> 03:02:13.300]  the 60s college campuses I think Obama's trained in that I think Hilary
[03:02:13.300 --> 03:02:16.820]  Clinton certainly is trained on that personal friend of Saul linsky and I
[03:02:16.820 --> 03:02:20.060]  think that as long as the progressive movement is still able to get all this
[03:02:20.060 --> 03:02:24.060]  money from Europe and from George Soros and from these big-time socialist
[03:02:24.060 --> 03:02:29.060]  billionaires to keep their supremacy going there the red the heat heated up
[03:02:29.060 --> 03:02:33.860]  ridiculous nonsense rhetoric violent divisive rhetoric of 60s college
[03:02:33.860 --> 03:02:38.340]  campuses is going to continue to dominate the political conversation in this
[03:02:38.340 --> 03:02:42.860]  country and they'll use CNN they'll use the media they'll use their the New York
[03:02:42.860 --> 03:02:46.900]  Times and their media apparatus to get their their points out and to put that
[03:02:46.900 --> 03:02:53.740]  propaganda out there but the the fever dreams of their 60s radical student days
[03:02:53.740 --> 03:03:00.860]  live on now in public policy and I think that's a very scary thing I just keep
[03:03:00.860 --> 03:03:05.380]  thinking there's got to be some into it it gets more bizarre more weird more
[03:03:05.380 --> 03:03:10.340]  crazy by the minute I go back to the example of Ron Silver saying how dare
[03:03:10.340 --> 03:03:14.380]  them threaten us with jets you know that's the military that's that's how
[03:03:14.380 --> 03:03:19.900]  anti-american they are and then Hilary's like no those are our jets now I mean
[03:03:19.900 --> 03:03:24.540]  it's they've dominated and taken over and already wrecked things so bad what do
[03:03:24.540 --> 03:03:27.100]  they think's gonna happen when they push people all the way to the wall
[03:03:27.100 --> 03:03:31.260]  they're gonna have a civil war and then put libertarians and conservatives in
[03:03:31.260 --> 03:03:34.980]  internment camps fun camps that Hilary talked about and Wesley Clark talked
[03:03:34.980 --> 03:03:38.820]  about I mean I mean they really are villains but they're so weak and
[03:03:38.820 --> 03:03:42.780]  pathetic don't they know once they push things into real revolution they're
[03:03:42.780 --> 03:03:46.340]  gonna get their butts kicked well they're certainly trying to stamp out the
[03:03:46.340 --> 03:03:52.460]  ideology you know I have a sister who's 16 and ask her about any political
[03:03:52.460 --> 03:03:57.500]  issue based on her schooling and public education or private education on
[03:03:57.500 --> 03:04:01.820]  college campuses and she will recite the most left-wing propaganda I've ever
[03:04:01.820 --> 03:04:06.060]  heard in my entire life they are they're brainwashing these children they they
[03:04:06.060 --> 03:04:10.820]  are stamping out the ideology that they don't like they think that they can get
[03:04:10.820 --> 03:04:13.620]  the young people to march and lockstep with the progressive movement and
[03:04:13.620 --> 03:04:17.500]  there aren't going to be any young libertarians or young right-wingers you
[03:04:17.500 --> 03:04:21.660]  know cropping up in the future and so the ones who already exist need to be
[03:04:21.660 --> 03:04:25.740]  taken care of and I don't think it's gonna come to internment camps but
[03:04:25.740 --> 03:04:29.740]  what's the difference when you have ETF knocking down your door and a gun in
[03:04:29.740 --> 03:04:34.140]  the face and saying give us guns because you know you have a nurse and so
[03:04:34.140 --> 03:04:37.220]  therefore you you're on the criminal background check sure it's the same thing
[03:04:37.220 --> 03:04:41.540]  and I mean it's like Seinfeld's a big liberal and he said my daughter I said
[03:04:41.540 --> 03:04:45.540]  hey you have a boyfriend and she goes that's sexist I mean just it's a cult
[03:04:45.540 --> 03:04:52.180]  they really are a cult by every sense thank you so much Patrick Howley daily
