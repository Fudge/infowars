[03:09.000 --> 03:13.000]  defeating the enemy believing you can defeat them knowing you can defeat them
[03:13.000 --> 03:19.000]  identifying them is the beginning of victory then you've got to simply have

[04:12.000 --> 04:16.000]  talking to the talk show host mr. Miller and he was talking about how they're
[04:16.000 --> 04:22.000]  noticing that info wars calm and prison planet calm is driving the news how
[04:22.000 --> 04:27.000]  everything we cover weeks and months before exactly as we cover it ends up

[08:06.000 --> 08:09.000]  radio network
[08:18.000 --> 08:24.000]  we are going live for three and a half hours today oh we're live all four hours
[08:24.000 --> 08:35.000]  radio this 20th day of October this Tuesday 20th day of October 2009 we're
[08:35.000 --> 08:39.000]  going to sample cast the last three and a half hours coming up in T-minus 22
[08:39.000 --> 08:46.000]  minutes at prisonplanet.tv for all the viewers over there because I want to
[08:46.000 --> 08:52.000]  show a few clips later in the broadcast from fall of the Republic because
[08:52.000 --> 08:57.000]  guess what I'm holding in my hot little hands we got some advanced copies of
[08:57.000 --> 09:03.000]  these last week and we got a couple thousand in yesterday but the big bulk
[09:03.000 --> 09:09.000]  shipment of these babies came in today and I am holding fall of the Republic
[09:09.000 --> 09:21.000]  or fall as Charlie Sheen calls it I am holding fall in my hands right now
[09:21.000 --> 09:28.000]  this is an incredible level of satisfaction six months of blood sweat
[09:28.000 --> 09:31.000]  and tears would take a normal documentary filmmaker I'm not bragging
[09:31.000 --> 09:38.000]  conservatively a year or two to make this but we put our essence into these
[09:38.000 --> 09:48.000]  films and to be holding this weapon system in my hand it is it is like I've
[09:48.000 --> 09:55.000]  had another child the sense of satisfaction and reward and a completion
[09:55.000 --> 10:05.000]  and wholesomeness and goodness the pat on the head I get from the universe just
[10:05.000 --> 10:13.000]  is absolutely fulfilling fulfillment all these people out there that want
[10:13.000 --> 10:19.000]  money and power and fame and it means nothing to all the people out there that
[10:19.000 --> 10:24.000]  Madison Avenue is made to feel insecure and weak the first thing they do is make
[10:24.000 --> 10:29.000]  you feel insecure and weak and pathetic so they can then sell you their mind
[10:29.000 --> 10:35.000]  system sell you their worldview sell you their ideas which are death and
[10:35.000 --> 10:39.000]  destruction and tyranny and weakness and you get weaker and weaker and you
[10:39.000 --> 10:44.000]  think oh if I just buy into their plan more maybe then I'll get fulfillment
[10:44.000 --> 10:48.000]  but when you actually stand against tyranny when you actually say I don't
[10:48.000 --> 10:52.000]  care if they kill me I don't care if they imprison me I don't care if they
[10:52.000 --> 11:03.000]  torture me I don't care what they do to me it's so liberating
[11:03.000 --> 11:08.000]  and I could say this is the most fulfilling thing in my life but but it is
[11:08.000 --> 11:14.000]  at a ingrained hardwired level more satisfying to see new children come into
[11:14.000 --> 11:20.000]  the world and to love my children but it's inexorably attached to that it is
[11:20.000 --> 11:27.000]  like a child because through films like this through works like this we are
[11:27.000 --> 11:31.000]  going to reach millions and millions and millions of people's minds that is
[11:31.000 --> 11:37.000]  such a sacred honor it is such a limitlessly important thing it is so
[11:37.000 --> 11:55.000]  crushingly humbling to make a commitment to make and commitment to goodness
[11:55.000 --> 12:01.000]  and it doesn't mean I'm perfect that's the lie of the New World Order it tells
[12:01.000 --> 12:05.000]  you you've got to be perfect that's what the devil does is whispers into your
[12:05.000 --> 12:10.000]  psyche into your conscience oh you're not good you're not going to have all the
[12:10.000 --> 12:14.000]  answers you're worthless oh you're trying to be good but there's no point
[12:14.000 --> 12:18.000]  nobody else is going to be good nobody else cares no but you know why don't
[12:18.000 --> 12:21.000]  you go ahead and cheat why don't you go ahead and try to get ahead why don't
[12:21.000 --> 12:27.000]  you go ahead and join the evil but once you ignore that and just stand up to
[12:27.000 --> 12:38.000]  goodness stand up for goodness stand up in goodness and say no to the
[12:38.000 --> 12:46.000]  corruption no to the evil things just change in your life and I just want
[12:46.000 --> 12:58.000]  people so badly to experience the fight against the New World Order and to see
[12:58.000 --> 13:08.000]  the results that come out of standing up against tyranny that's what I want
[13:08.000 --> 13:13.000]  people to experience that's what I want people to know that's what I want
[13:13.000 --> 13:23.000]  people to understand because it is indescribable how good it is and how
[13:23.000 --> 13:34.000]  fulfilling it is to know that at least my films are polished and focused and
[13:34.000 --> 13:40.000]  getting better and better each time and really represent the truth and really
[13:40.000 --> 13:49.000]  represent a deep view into what I know and what I understand and to be able to
[13:49.000 --> 13:58.000]  at least at one level put a message out that is very close to pure when you
[13:58.000 --> 14:04.000]  come up here when anybody gets up on the radio and you engage in two three
[14:04.000 --> 14:10.000]  four hours of radio a day or in the case of what I do and I'm doing a lot of
[14:10.000 --> 14:14.000]  interviews some days I've done ten eleven twelve hours of talking you're going to
[14:14.000 --> 14:18.000]  make a lot of mistakes you're going to stumble your English is going to get
[14:18.000 --> 14:28.000]  bad you're going to get tongue tied and it's frustrating because in your
[14:28.000 --> 14:33.000]  psyche in your intellect in your intellectual understanding what you're
[14:33.000 --> 14:37.000]  trying to put in simple words is so much more complex and so much more
[14:37.000 --> 14:42.000]  detailed and so clear and if you could only get people to see what you're
[14:42.000 --> 14:46.000]  seeing and to understand what you're understanding and to read the globalist
[14:46.000 --> 14:50.000]  documents and to see them on video announcing not just that there's a
[14:50.000 --> 14:54.000]  world government but what that world government's going to consist of pure
[14:54.000 --> 15:01.000]  bondage if you could just get people to see what you've discovered I use the
[15:01.000 --> 15:04.000]  analogy a lot because I've read quite a bit of criminology and I've seen the
[15:04.000 --> 15:11.000]  basic psychology played out over and over again of when a neighbor sees
[15:11.000 --> 15:15.000]  something suspicious looks like a bundle looks like a dead body being put in the
[15:15.000 --> 15:23.000]  back of a car and then years later the serial killer neighbor gets caught
[15:23.000 --> 15:28.000]  kidnapping some woman or some child and so police finally show up at the house
[15:28.000 --> 15:33.000]  go into the basement of the backyard and dig up 15 20 35 people 40 something
[15:33.000 --> 15:40.000]  people depending on the cases and the neighbor just can't believe that their
[15:40.000 --> 15:46.000]  neighbor was actually a murderer that went out and prayed on people like a big
[15:46.000 --> 15:51.000]  black spider a big hairy spider and drug them back into their nest to torture
[15:51.000 --> 15:58.000]  them to death in their little dungeons and see I have seen the new world
[15:58.000 --> 16:01.000]  orders documents I've read where they're putting poison in our water I've read
[16:01.000 --> 16:04.000]  where they're chemtrailing us and they're bragging about it I've read where
[16:04.000 --> 16:08.000]  they plan to take all our children at birth and raise them in dormitories and
[16:08.000 --> 16:12.000]  kill the majority of us and have control by weapons releases and I've read where
[16:12.000 --> 16:16.000]  they invented aids of soft kill weapon that attacks Africans more than any other
[16:16.000 --> 16:21.000]  group that's race specific I've read Dick Cheney where he talks about the use of
[16:21.000 --> 16:25.000]  race specific bio weapons in the September 20 2000 rebuilding America's
[16:25.000 --> 16:31.000]  defenses I know about the dead bodies in the basement I've seen them covered in
[16:31.000 --> 16:37.000]  maggots I see it every time I just have a inkling of fear or doubt about the path
[16:37.000 --> 16:41.000]  I'm on fighting these people I just think about all the innocence they're tearing
[16:41.000 --> 16:45.000]  limb from limb that they're having their way with and then I'm just completely
[16:45.000 --> 16:53.000]  filled with energy and resistance against this tyranny and it is so fulfilling
[16:53.000 --> 16:57.000]  to be able to make a film that I'm proud of to make a film that's high quality to
[16:57.000 --> 17:03.000]  make a film that's truthful that I've done my best to make sure is a hundred
[17:03.000 --> 17:08.000]  percent accurate that I've done my best to make sure is pure that I've done my
[17:08.000 --> 17:16.000]  best and that my great crew Aaron Dykes and Rob Jacobson and Rob Dube and all
[17:16.000 --> 17:21.000]  the other people in this office and all the other camera people that have done
[17:21.000 --> 17:27.000]  such a great job and Jason Douglas and everyone else and Michael McWhorter and
[17:27.000 --> 17:35.000]  Glenn Dill and Derek Eimkopf and Will and everybody else in this office that
[17:35.000 --> 17:40.000]  made this film possible and to see it and and to know that if I'm allowed by
[17:40.000 --> 17:44.000]  the good Lord above to just live a little bit longer I'm not afraid of death
[17:44.000 --> 17:48.000]  I'm not afraid of imprisonment I'm not I'm committed and I know I'll probably
[17:48.000 --> 17:53.000]  find my true strength when I go through more tribulations but my flesh doesn't
[17:53.000 --> 17:58.000]  want it but at the same time I just ask God for more time to make even better
[17:58.000 --> 18:04.000]  films and more informative films and it is so fulfilling to be on this path and
[18:04.000 --> 18:09.000]  to see my team working together our great IT guys and everybody here in the
[18:09.000 --> 18:13.000]  office the people that answer the phones the people that pack the videos people
[18:13.000 --> 18:17.000]  that ship them out to you everybody here my wife and family that puts up with
[18:17.000 --> 18:21.000]  me working long hours and when I finally take a break I'm stumbling around
[18:21.000 --> 18:26.000]  like a zombie at my house I can only think now and basically operate when
[18:26.000 --> 18:31.000]  I'm fighting the new world order I'm officially completely passed burnout
[18:31.000 --> 18:36.000]  I'm now completely a creature of resistance completely a tool completely
[18:36.000 --> 18:41.000]  filled with resistance resistance is that tree
[18:46.000 --> 18:52.000]  I now and completely a slave but a slave of life a slave of goodness I am now
[18:52.000 --> 18:55.000]  completely turning myself over to this
[18:55.000 --> 19:03.000]  I turned myself over a long time ago but I recognize I'm completely turned over

[36:02.000 --> 36:09.000]  transmission because you get the DVD and you put it in your DVD burner and you
[36:09.000 --> 36:12.000]  make copies of this and you give it to other people and tell them to make
[36:12.000 --> 36:16.000]  copies mainstream news admits my last film the Obama deception the most
[36:16.000 --> 36:21.000]  powerful we ever released the most viral we ever released has devastated them
[36:21.000 --> 36:25.000]  right wingers watch it thinking that they're about to see Obama bashed and
[36:25.000 --> 36:30.000]  find out it comes in and attacks Bush and Obama and we literally unlock their
[36:30.000 --> 36:33.000]  minds because as long as they're kept in the left right paradigm like a
[36:33.000 --> 36:38.000]  football game back and forth they can never be effective or stand up or
[36:38.000 --> 36:42.000]  wake up but once they understand it's all staged then their minds are open to
[36:42.000 --> 36:48.000]  the bigger picture this film America's last stand follow the Republic
[36:48.000 --> 36:52.000]  documents how an offshore corporate cartel is bankrupting us accounted by
[36:52.000 --> 36:55.000]  design leaders are now declaring that world government has arrived and the
[36:55.000 --> 36:59.000]  dollar will be replaced with a new global currency President Obama has
[36:59.000 --> 37:02.000]  brazenly violated article one section of the US Constitution by seating
[37:02.000 --> 37:05.000]  himself at the head of the United Nations Security Council thus
[37:05.000 --> 37:08.000]  becoming the first US president to chair the world body a scientific
[37:08.000 --> 37:12.000]  dictatorship is in its final stages of completion and laws protecting basic
[37:12.000 --> 37:16.000]  human rights are being abolished worldwide an iron curtain of high-tech
[37:16.000 --> 37:21.000]  tyranny is now descending on the planet over the planet a worldwide regime
[37:21.000 --> 37:26.000]  controlled by an unelected corporate elite is implementing a planetary
[37:26.000 --> 37:30.000]  carbon tax system that will dominate all human activity and establish a
[37:30.000 --> 37:35.000]  system of neo feudal slavery the image makers of carefully packaged Obama as
[37:35.000 --> 37:39.000]  the world's savior he is the Trojan horse manufactured to passify the public
[37:39.000 --> 37:43.000]  just long enough for the globalist to complete their master plan this film
[37:43.000 --> 37:47.000]  reveals the architecture of the new world order and what the power elite
[37:47.000 --> 37:51.000]  have in store for humanity more importantly communicates how we the people
[37:51.000 --> 37:55.000]  can take control of our government turn the criminal tide and bring the

[41:48.000 --> 41:53.000]  sit back shut up while he goes through the four pages of notes he's got from
[41:53.000 --> 41:56.000]  this meeting with an insider that's been proven to be very accurate in the past
[41:56.000 --> 42:00.000]  the inside knowledge also mirrors my inside connections and intel and
[42:00.000 --> 42:04.000]  government white papers and corporate white papers i'm tracking so this is one
[42:04.000 --> 42:07.000]  perspective from one high-level top globalist though so there's different
[42:07.000 --> 42:11.000]  interpretations you gotta be so later in the hour next hour we'll try to break
[42:11.000 --> 42:14.000]  that down but i will before we go to lindsay williams waiting in the wings
[42:14.000 --> 42:20.000]  right now i want to go to ted anderson for one update today because gold
[42:20.000 --> 42:28.000]  shot up above one thousand sixty six dollars an all-time total high and to
[42:28.000 --> 42:32.000]  be able to make these films to be able to do this radio should be able to fund
[42:32.000 --> 42:36.000]  myself we have sponsors so you know i talk about this being something totally
[42:36.000 --> 42:40.000]  pure something i can really be proud of a hundred percent whereas the radio show
[42:40.000 --> 42:44.000]  i'm ranting i'm raving it's not polished it's not completely focused but it's
[42:44.000 --> 42:49.000]  effective it's the same thing with our sponsors if i've got to have sponsors
[42:49.000 --> 42:53.000]  i might as well go find sponsors i believe in i get a great a color blue
[42:53.000 --> 42:56.000]  water filter i believe in works great for me i call them and say you want to be
[42:56.000 --> 43:02.000]  sponsors they go absolutely we're already listeners i ted anderson starts
[43:02.000 --> 43:06.000]  this network when another little network i was on went under i went with him
[43:06.000 --> 43:11.000]  twelve years ago never censored me only supported me he's a moral sweetheart also
[43:11.000 --> 43:15.000]  happens to have the best prices on gold and silver i found it you're getting the
[43:15.000 --> 43:19.000]  deals i get so i bring him on this is also but but let me tell you when he does
[43:19.000 --> 43:26.000]  these loss leader deals i know the markup he buys this gold and silver when it's
[43:26.000 --> 43:30.000]  low and then when it goes up he sells it at the lower price that's how he's
[43:30.000 --> 43:34.000]  becoming such a force in metal he's been doing it thirty years but thirteen years
[43:34.000 --> 43:39.000]  almost twelve and a half with minus resources
[43:39.000 --> 43:43.000]  like i've seen it with a two hundred and thirty four dollar coin four dollar
[43:43.000 --> 43:48.000]  markup because i get the actual sheets on what these costing nobody else is
[43:48.000 --> 43:51.000]  selling coins with a four dollar four dollars he's selling a two hundred and
[43:51.000 --> 43:56.000]  something dollar coin and making four dollars and that's making that's just
[43:56.000 --> 44:00.000]  one example sometimes it's five dollars sometimes it's ten dollars if it's like
[44:00.000 --> 44:04.000]  a thousand dollar you know full ounce coin but make it ten bucks he does that
[44:04.000 --> 44:09.000]  through bulk but when he does deals where he bought gold at a thousand and
[44:09.000 --> 44:13.000]  he's selling it to you while he still has it when it's a thousand sixty six
[44:13.000 --> 44:17.000]  from when the market was marked in at a thousand or when he's still selling
[44:17.000 --> 44:22.000]  silver he bought at twelve dollars an ounce when it's eighteen dollars an
[44:22.000 --> 44:26.000]  ounce or almost eighteen seventeen something that's an insane deal
[44:26.000 --> 44:30.000]  yet i gotta go to lindsay williams i appreciate you coming on appreciate lindsay
[44:30.000 --> 44:35.000]  holding but briefly tell folks the coins you've got the off the the offer and
[44:35.000 --> 44:39.000]  the number they call well right now the coins that i'm working with right now
[44:39.000 --> 44:43.000]  the british sovereigns are two ninety three francs are two thirty eight same
[44:43.000 --> 44:47.000]  price i did yesterday but gold went up higher today you're right about that
[44:47.000 --> 44:52.000]  the asian markets drove gold up to one thousand just under one thousand sixty
[44:52.000 --> 44:56.000]  when the new york market opened up and dropped it down to about a thousand
[44:56.000 --> 44:59.000]  fifty one but the new bottom looks like it's a thousand fifty
[44:59.000 --> 45:04.000]  yeah it just hits that level i'm i'm just hoping i can get a chance to buy
[45:04.000 --> 45:07.000]  gold again in a thousand five but i don't think i'm gonna get it
[45:07.000 --> 45:11.000]  the dollar dropping again i mean it's just crazy what's going on in the
[45:11.000 --> 45:16.000]  marketplace anybody be a fool to think that this fiat currency is going to hold
[45:16.000 --> 45:20.000]  together so i really do if you're if you're interested at all in gold and
[45:20.000 --> 45:25.000]  silver the walking liberties at eight sixty nine francs at two hundred and
[45:25.000 --> 45:30.000]  thirty eight british sovereigns at two ninety three they're a good buy and
[45:30.000 --> 45:34.000]  alex i just have to say if you get small pieces of gold and silver in your
[45:34.000 --> 45:39.000]  hand and everything falls apart like i think it's going to be darn happy you
[45:39.000 --> 45:44.000]  have it darn happy absolutely eight hundred six eight six two two three
[45:44.000 --> 45:48.000]  seven eight hundred six eight six two two three seven i bought some silver last
[45:48.000 --> 45:53.000]  ten how long can you hold the silver deal
[45:53.000 --> 45:57.000]  well you know i'm pretty sure we're gonna be looking at twenty dollars over here
[45:57.000 --> 46:01.000]  pretty soon just because silver keeps on punching up to that eighteen dollar level
[46:01.000 --> 46:05.000]  and then backs up to it backs down to about seventeen thirty nine
[46:05.000 --> 46:10.000]  you know i would have to assume that sometime before the end of october
[46:10.000 --> 46:14.000]  that we're gonna see eighteen nineteen dollars over and walking liberties are
[46:14.000 --> 46:18.000]  going to be at eight sixty nine that's when you've got frank's and gold you've
[46:18.000 --> 46:21.000]  got a lot of other coins but these are the special deal you've got sovereigns
[46:21.000 --> 46:25.000]  eight hundred six eight six two two three seven how long till you run out of
[46:25.000 --> 46:30.000]  those well you know i'm just kind of keeping my finger on the pulse here
[46:30.000 --> 46:34.000]  as long as i can continue to get these little dips that i'm getting down to
[46:34.000 --> 46:39.000]  that one thousand fifty one fifty five level i'm gonna hold it at this price
[46:39.000 --> 46:42.000]  but if it jumps over one thousand sixty and holds
[46:42.000 --> 46:45.000]  you know prices are going to rise that's just the way it's going to be eight
[46:45.000 --> 46:49.000]  hundred six eight six two two three seven eight hundred six eight six two
[46:49.000 --> 46:54.000]  two three seven or minus resources dot com tell them alex jones since you are
[46:54.000 --> 46:57.000]  going to be paying a higher price which is still a great deal ted thank you
[46:57.000 --> 47:02.000]  thanks alex you bet okay

[48:14.000 --> 48:18.000]  listening audience everything i just heard alex say here a few moments ago
[48:18.000 --> 48:22.000]  was the truth now alex said give me a brief background okay i will and make it
[48:22.000 --> 48:27.000]  very brief because there's so much else to be said for three years time i was
[48:27.000 --> 48:32.000]  the chaplain to the elite of the world how did it happen i was a missionary in
[48:32.000 --> 48:36.000]  the state of alaska that was when they began building the trans-alaska oil
[48:36.000 --> 48:40.000]  pipeline i heard that thirty five thousand the roughest toughest customers
[48:40.000 --> 48:43.000]  drinking this honor his folks on the face of the earth we're going to be that
[48:43.000 --> 48:48.000]  bill that pipeline i went to aliaska pipeline service company i said do you
[48:48.000 --> 48:52.000]  need a chaplain on the pipeline they laughed at me they said we never had a
[48:52.000 --> 48:56.000]  chaplain on the pipeline before in our life finally they allowed me i guess i
[48:56.000 --> 49:00.000]  kept going back and back enough persistence paid off they gave me the
[49:00.000 --> 49:04.000]  poodle bay area all the way down to galbraith lake seven work camps
[49:04.000 --> 49:09.000]  uh... about six months later the personnel relations band with aliaska came
[49:09.000 --> 49:13.000]  to me and said chaplain you're saving us thousands of dollars of counseling fees
[49:13.000 --> 49:18.000]  we'd like to give you executive status alex i had not the slightest idea but
[49:18.000 --> 49:22.000]  this was by the providence of god folks please listen to this
[49:22.000 --> 49:27.000]  i can put it no other way i'm just an ordinary everyday person like you i was
[49:27.000 --> 49:31.000]  nothing but an aviation missionary flying around out in the bush of alaska
[49:31.000 --> 49:36.000]  but by the providence of god god put me into the board meetings with the elite
[49:36.000 --> 49:42.000]  of the world that very few people ever get to know personally one-on-one
[49:42.000 --> 49:46.000]  and for three years time i sat across the dinner table from them i lived in the
[49:46.000 --> 49:51.000]  dorms with them i was able to pick their brains and to analyze their mindset
[49:51.000 --> 49:55.000]  and to write three books later about how these people think and do and has a
[49:55.000 --> 49:59.000]  result for the past thirty-five years i have been in touch with some of these
[49:59.000 --> 50:04.000]  people and i still have the phone numbers personally that i can call them
[50:04.000 --> 50:08.000]  and they will not allow me to give out their names one of them is over eighty-five
[50:08.000 --> 50:15.000]  years of age and just recently in fact days ago only a few days ago i talked
[50:15.000 --> 50:19.000]  with him on the telephone and he gave me all of this information alex i honestly
[50:19.000 --> 50:24.000]  believe that by the providence of god i was given this information so that i can
[50:24.000 --> 50:28.000]  back up everything that you and others like you are saying
[50:28.000 --> 50:33.000]  folks it is true the fall of the republic or i'm so glad you've got this dvd

[52:18.000 --> 52:20.000]  and they really are calling the shots
[52:20.000 --> 52:25.000]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention
[52:25.000 --> 52:28.000]  full of the republic identifies the enemies of our nation
[52:28.000 --> 52:33.000]  the criminal offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty
[52:33.000 --> 52:35.000]  and on its ashes constructing world government
[52:35.000 --> 52:39.000]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, and arsonists they're asking for more matches
[52:39.000 --> 52:42.000]  and the Congress is saying who do we make the checkout to

[54:07.000 --> 54:09.000]  it's rolling around the bend
[54:09.000 --> 54:12.000]  and I ain't seen the sunshine
[54:12.000 --> 54:14.000]  I don't know when
[54:14.000 --> 54:16.000]  I'm stuck in fools in prison
[54:16.000 --> 54:19.000]  and time keeps dragging on
[54:19.000 --> 54:21.000]  We are back live
[54:21.000 --> 54:25.000]  Okay, Lindsay, people are chomping at the bit to hear this info
[54:25.000 --> 54:26.000]  they want to hear it all
[54:26.000 --> 54:28.000]  I know you to tell it more in the DVD
[54:28.000 --> 54:30.000]  we'll talk about that coming up in the next hour
[54:30.000 --> 54:33.000]  but this is a short segment, next one's short, long one coming up
[54:33.000 --> 54:36.000]  but I'm going to just sit back
[54:36.000 --> 54:39.000]  he called you, thought he was close to dying
[54:39.000 --> 54:42.000]  spilt his guts to you about the whole agenda
[54:42.000 --> 54:45.000]  start going through the bullet points
[54:45.000 --> 54:48.000]  you've got the floor
[54:48.000 --> 54:51.000]  all of the republic, I'll tell you how long you've got
[54:51.000 --> 54:53.000]  he told me, he made it very plain
[54:53.000 --> 54:55.000]  I'm going to give you his exact statements
[54:55.000 --> 54:57.000]  you want to punch lines, here they are
[54:57.000 --> 54:59.000]  I'll give them to you just as he told me
[54:59.000 --> 55:03.000]  now keep in mind folks, this is a man who knows everything
[55:03.000 --> 55:05.000]  that goes on behind closed doors
[55:05.000 --> 55:07.000]  he's over 85 years of age
[55:07.000 --> 55:09.000]  he almost died last winter
[55:09.000 --> 55:11.000]  he confessed, basically all I can say is
[55:11.000 --> 55:14.000]  he told me everything that you can imagine
[55:14.000 --> 55:17.000]  I have never had such information given to me before
[55:17.000 --> 55:19.000]  he said, quote, within two years
[55:19.000 --> 55:22.000]  you will not recognize America
[55:22.000 --> 55:25.000]  everything you're saying on this DVD
[55:25.000 --> 55:28.000]  of yours, Alex Jones, they fall out the republic
[55:28.000 --> 55:31.000]  it is true, you have two years or less
[55:31.000 --> 55:33.000]  and it's gone
[55:33.000 --> 55:35.000]  your children and your grandchildren
[55:35.000 --> 55:38.000]  according to him will be nothing but slaves
[55:38.000 --> 55:41.000]  to the elite for the rest of their lives
[55:41.000 --> 55:44.000]  folks, we are selling our children
[55:44.000 --> 55:47.000]  to the elite within two years
[55:47.000 --> 55:50.000]  unless they think that they have it made
[55:50.000 --> 55:52.000]  I'd like to prove them wrong Alex
[55:52.000 --> 55:54.000]  and I think you're going to prove them wrong also
[55:54.000 --> 55:56.000]  the next statement, he said
[55:56.000 --> 55:59.000]  the elite have altered their timeline
[55:59.000 --> 56:01.000]  and we'll go into this more later in the show
[56:01.000 --> 56:03.000]  as we go along, but you've got to understand
[56:03.000 --> 56:05.000]  that the elite are not divine
[56:05.000 --> 56:07.000]  they're human beings
[56:07.000 --> 56:09.000]  they think they're divine most of the time
[56:09.000 --> 56:11.000]  but they have had to alter their timeline
[56:11.000 --> 56:13.000]  they did it because you gave them
[56:13.000 --> 56:16.000]  two and one half trillion approximately dollars
[56:16.000 --> 56:18.000]  in the last two to three months
[56:18.000 --> 56:20.000]  of the Bush administration
[56:20.000 --> 56:23.000]  and they have had to change a few things around
[56:23.000 --> 56:25.000]  next great statement he made
[56:25.000 --> 56:28.000]  after two years, and folks this is startling
[56:28.000 --> 56:30.000]  I'm quoting him verbatim
[56:30.000 --> 56:33.000]  after two years you will be so poor
[56:33.000 --> 56:35.000]  you will not be able to rebel
[56:35.000 --> 56:38.000]  now they have a timeline
[56:38.000 --> 56:40.000]  a two year period, folks
[56:40.000 --> 56:43.000]  we must do something within this period of time
[56:43.000 --> 56:46.000]  or we are slaves
[56:46.000 --> 56:48.000]  and we'll never be able to get out of this treaty
[56:48.000 --> 56:51.000]  that our president is signing here
[56:51.000 --> 56:53.000]  just in a matter of days
[56:53.000 --> 56:56.000]  please understand what Alex is saying about this
[56:56.000 --> 56:59.000]  it is only a part of the elite program
[56:59.000 --> 57:02.000]  to be able to bring about what he said to me
[57:02.000 --> 57:05.000]  he said after two years you will be so poor
[57:05.000 --> 57:07.000]  that you will not be able to rebel against him
[57:07.000 --> 57:09.000]  you won't be able to buy an airline ticket
[57:09.000 --> 57:11.000]  you won't be able to go somewhere to a rally
[57:11.000 --> 57:14.000]  you won't be able to have another Boston Tea Party
[57:14.000 --> 57:17.000]  they have it planned as far as inflation is concerned
[57:17.000 --> 57:19.000]  his next statement
[57:19.000 --> 57:23.000]  in the inflation will escalate over a period of two years
[57:23.000 --> 57:25.000]  again, crude oil prices
[57:25.000 --> 57:27.000]  they will fluctuate a little bit
[57:27.000 --> 57:29.000]  but they are still going to stay
[57:29.000 --> 57:33.000]  down way below what they were when it was $147 barrel
[57:33.000 --> 57:36.000]  oh please, all the gold you can Alex
[57:36.000 --> 57:39.000]  it's my time you take in order to sell gold
[57:39.000 --> 57:42.000]  I beg of you, get all the gold and silver you can
[57:42.000 --> 57:45.000]  in your hands because he said to me
[57:45.000 --> 57:48.000]  he said gold and silver are all you can rely on
[57:48.000 --> 57:51.000]  he again said this is their currency
[57:51.000 --> 57:54.000]  it's what they depend on
[57:54.000 --> 57:56.000]  they don't depend on a piece of paper
[57:56.000 --> 57:58.000]  they laugh at that
[57:58.000 --> 58:01.000]  again, by 2012 the dollar will be dead
[58:01.000 --> 58:04.000]  now, I'm just giving you the best I can
[58:04.000 --> 58:07.000]  the statements as I looked them very fast
[58:07.000 --> 58:09.000]  as he was giving them to me
[58:09.000 --> 58:12.000]  2010-2012 is a timeline for them
[58:12.000 --> 58:15.000]  I know it's a part of the Mayan calendar also
[58:15.000 --> 58:17.000]  which I don't pay much attention to
[58:17.000 --> 58:19.000]  but whenever a person like this is the elite
[58:19.000 --> 58:21.000]  remember, two years ago
[58:21.000 --> 58:24.000]  he said to me the price of crude oil is going
[58:24.000 --> 58:26.000]  for $147 a barrel
[58:26.000 --> 58:28.000]  for $50 a barrel
[58:28.000 --> 58:30.000]  everybody thought I was crazy
[58:30.000 --> 58:32.000]  in fact, I don't think you should be on your show
[58:32.000 --> 58:35.000]  at first with that Alex, it was so sparkling
[58:35.000 --> 58:38.000]  we had you on as soon as we learned about it

[1:00:17.000 --> 1:00:20.000]  and now live from Austin, Texas
[1:00:20.000 --> 1:00:22.000]  Alex Jones
[1:00:26.000 --> 1:00:28.000]  Alright Lindsey Williams
[1:00:28.000 --> 1:00:30.000]  continuing we're into hour number two
[1:00:30.000 --> 1:00:32.000]  you were going through
[1:00:32.000 --> 1:00:34.000]  yesterday we didn't get into the chronology
[1:00:34.000 --> 1:00:36.000]  of events he gave you
[1:00:36.000 --> 1:00:39.000]  we had just gotten up to the point
[1:00:39.000 --> 1:00:41.000]  where he was talking about bringing in inflation
[1:00:41.000 --> 1:00:43.000]  over the next two years
[1:00:43.000 --> 1:00:45.000]  I just want to add that I run into a lot of
[1:00:45.000 --> 1:00:47.000]  high-powered people in Austin over the years
[1:00:47.000 --> 1:00:49.000]  and I've heard repeatedly
[1:00:49.000 --> 1:00:52.000]  for people who are extremely wealthy
[1:00:52.000 --> 1:00:55.000]  and once I ran into a very well-known person
[1:00:55.000 --> 1:00:57.000]  who knew who I was
[1:00:57.000 --> 1:01:00.000]  and just told me I'm leaving the country
[1:01:00.000 --> 1:01:02.000]  this is two years ago they said
[1:01:02.000 --> 1:01:04.000]  in the next few years America won't exist
[1:01:04.000 --> 1:01:07.000]  and I said what does that mean they said you'll see
[1:01:07.000 --> 1:01:09.000]  and I went and looked up I vaguely knew who they were
[1:01:09.000 --> 1:01:11.000]  I went and looked them up and
[1:01:11.000 --> 1:01:13.000]  didn't even know they were worth billions of dollars
[1:01:13.000 --> 1:01:15.000]  other stuff so the point is
[1:01:15.000 --> 1:01:17.000]  there's a lot of intel backing up when Lindsey sang
[1:01:17.000 --> 1:01:19.000]  Lindsey continue
[1:01:19.000 --> 1:01:21.000]  You're right Alex they have a two-year
[1:01:21.000 --> 1:01:24.000]  timeline and folks I wish I could stress to this
[1:01:24.000 --> 1:01:26.000]  to you more
[1:01:26.000 --> 1:01:28.000]  the first time I met the elite years ago
[1:01:28.000 --> 1:01:30.000]  I was appalled
[1:01:30.000 --> 1:01:32.000]  that there could be people on the face of the earth
[1:01:32.000 --> 1:01:34.000]  who would intentionally manipulate governments
[1:01:34.000 --> 1:01:36.000]  people, nations, currencies
[1:01:36.000 --> 1:01:38.000]  and totally control it
[1:01:38.000 --> 1:01:41.000]  and I need to elaborate again
[1:01:41.000 --> 1:01:43.000]  there positively is a group of people
[1:01:43.000 --> 1:01:45.000]  on the face of the earth who control the world
[1:01:45.000 --> 1:01:47.000]  and they've got 2012
[1:01:47.000 --> 1:01:49.000]  he said the dollar will be dead
[1:01:49.000 --> 1:01:51.000]  now here's the next one that he said that
[1:01:51.000 --> 1:01:53.000]  I'm still shaking
[1:01:53.000 --> 1:01:56.000]  I must admit I'm appalled
[1:01:56.000 --> 1:01:59.000]  he said war is planned after two years
[1:01:59.000 --> 1:02:01.000]  folks they plan these things
[1:02:01.000 --> 1:02:03.000]  they know where they're going
[1:02:03.000 --> 1:02:05.000]  they know what they're doing
[1:02:05.000 --> 1:02:07.000]  and they're going to do it exactly
[1:02:07.000 --> 1:02:09.000]  as they said they were going to
[1:02:09.000 --> 1:02:11.000]  because they know exactly
[1:02:11.000 --> 1:02:13.000]  please believe me
[1:02:13.000 --> 1:02:15.000]  whenever I say that the elite
[1:02:15.000 --> 1:02:17.000]  know exactly what they're going to accomplish
[1:02:17.000 --> 1:02:19.000]  and how they're going to go about it
[1:02:19.000 --> 1:02:22.000]  and they have war planned in 2012
[1:02:22.000 --> 1:02:25.000]  or somewhere along in that area
[1:02:25.000 --> 1:02:27.000]  and he even told me where it was going to start
[1:02:27.000 --> 1:02:29.000]  how it was going to happen
[1:02:29.000 --> 1:02:32.000]  what would happen it would spread through the entire world
[1:02:32.000 --> 1:02:34.000]  and every bit of this is
[1:02:34.000 --> 1:02:36.000]  I'll elaborate more on point after point
[1:02:36.000 --> 1:02:38.000]  as Alex wants it
[1:02:38.000 --> 1:02:40.000]  we must take action
[1:02:40.000 --> 1:02:42.000]  immediately
[1:02:42.000 --> 1:02:44.000]  get this DVD by Alex Jones
[1:02:44.000 --> 1:02:46.000]  please get out
[1:02:46.000 --> 1:02:48.000]  millions of copies of it
[1:02:48.000 --> 1:02:50.000]  do you realize that we've got two years
[1:02:50.000 --> 1:02:52.000]  they haven't planned
[1:02:52.000 --> 1:02:54.000]  they gave me the figure
[1:02:54.000 --> 1:02:56.000]  two years over and over and over
[1:02:56.000 --> 1:02:58.000]  you have two years or your children
[1:02:58.000 --> 1:03:00.000]  and grandchildren will be slaves
[1:03:00.000 --> 1:03:02.000]  as Alex said a moment ago
[1:03:02.000 --> 1:03:04.000]  he heard somebody who was one of the rich people
[1:03:04.000 --> 1:03:06.000]  that said we're leaving America
[1:03:06.000 --> 1:03:08.000]  he said you won't know America in two years time
[1:03:08.000 --> 1:03:10.000]  this is exactly what this gentleman said to me
[1:03:10.000 --> 1:03:12.000]  he said within two years
[1:03:12.000 --> 1:03:14.000]  you will not recognize
[1:03:14.000 --> 1:03:16.000]  the United States of America
[1:03:16.000 --> 1:03:18.000]  now if I could put it in everyday
[1:03:18.000 --> 1:03:20.000]  terms so that even
[1:03:20.000 --> 1:03:22.000]  I could understand it
[1:03:22.000 --> 1:03:24.000]  the elite are laughing at the gullible
[1:03:24.000 --> 1:03:26.000]  stupid American who has fallen
[1:03:26.000 --> 1:03:28.000]  for every line
[1:03:28.000 --> 1:03:30.000]  that they've put out there for you
[1:03:30.000 --> 1:03:32.000]  you've taken that baseball apple pie and beer
[1:03:32.000 --> 1:03:34.000]  you've run with it
[1:03:34.000 --> 1:03:36.000]  you're satisfied to take their job
[1:03:36.000 --> 1:03:38.000]  just over broke
[1:03:38.000 --> 1:03:40.000]  and accept what they have given you
[1:03:40.000 --> 1:03:42.000]  and you have not risen up
[1:03:42.000 --> 1:03:44.000]  and rebelled
[1:03:44.000 --> 1:03:46.000]  you've got to do something folks
[1:03:46.000 --> 1:03:48.000]  now please
[1:03:48.000 --> 1:03:50.000]  I beg of you
[1:03:50.000 --> 1:03:52.000]  alright here we go
[1:03:52.000 --> 1:03:54.000]  within two years nearly everyone will be working
[1:03:54.000 --> 1:03:56.000]  for the federal government
[1:03:56.000 --> 1:03:58.000]  did you hear this
[1:03:58.000 --> 1:04:00.000]  he said this
[1:04:00.000 --> 1:04:02.000]  he said everyone
[1:04:02.000 --> 1:04:04.000]  will be working for the federal government
[1:04:04.000 --> 1:04:06.000]  think about it for a moment
[1:04:06.000 --> 1:04:08.000]  General Motors
[1:04:08.000 --> 1:04:10.000]  so who stepped in and bailed them out
[1:04:10.000 --> 1:04:12.000]  who is the CEO of General Motors right now
[1:04:12.000 --> 1:04:14.000]  the president of the United States of America
[1:04:14.000 --> 1:04:16.000]  who is the CEO of Pricewater
[1:04:16.000 --> 1:04:18.000]  everybody who works for General Motors at Pricewater
[1:04:18.000 --> 1:04:20.000]  is working for the federal government right now
[1:04:20.000 --> 1:04:22.000]  how about the banks
[1:04:22.000 --> 1:04:24.000]  they're taking over five or six or seven or eight almost every weekend
[1:04:24.000 --> 1:04:26.000]  do you realize that
[1:04:26.000 --> 1:04:28.000]  they want to narrow it down to nine
[1:04:28.000 --> 1:04:30.000]  come on you got to hear the figure
[1:04:30.000 --> 1:04:32.000]  put it down
[1:04:32.000 --> 1:04:34.000]  write it down and watch it happen
[1:04:34.000 --> 1:04:36.000]  they're going to narrow it down to nine major banks
[1:04:36.000 --> 1:04:38.000]  then they'll be able to bail out
[1:04:38.000 --> 1:04:40.000]  and they already have
[1:04:40.000 --> 1:04:42.000]  bail out the ones that will lift
[1:04:42.000 --> 1:04:44.000]  stay right there
[1:04:44.000 --> 1:04:46.000]  vertical integration of the economy
[1:04:46.000 --> 1:04:48.000]  criminal consolidation
[1:04:48.000 --> 1:04:50.000]  the globalist IMF World Bank
[1:04:50.000 --> 1:04:52.000]  G20 documents say as much
[1:04:52.000 --> 1:04:54.000]  as your source told you
[1:04:54.000 --> 1:04:56.000]  we're going to continue to go through this
[1:04:56.000 --> 1:04:58.000]  and the information we didn't get to yesterday
[1:04:58.000 --> 1:05:00.000]  we're recapping right now with Lindsay Williams
[1:05:00.000 --> 1:05:02.000]  the illusion created by the power elite
[1:05:02.000 --> 1:05:04.000]  is a lie that covers even
[1:05:04.000 --> 1:05:06.000]  the food they want you to eat
[1:05:06.000 --> 1:05:08.000]  will you continue to be their profit center
[1:05:08.000 --> 1:05:10.000]  buying their processed food that makes you sick
[1:05:10.000 --> 1:05:12.000]  go to the doctor and buy their drugs
[1:05:12.000 --> 1:05:14.000]  you don't have to cooperate

[1:08:10.440 --> 1:08:11.440]  You want answers?
[1:08:11.440 --> 1:08:13.600]  Well, so does he.
[1:08:13.600 --> 1:08:36.520]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network, and now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[1:08:36.520 --> 1:08:38.120]  Lindsey Williams is our guest.
[1:08:38.120 --> 1:08:39.360]  Okay, Lindsey, continue.
[1:08:39.360 --> 1:08:43.960]  We're going through this former CEO of a major oil company and insider who you've worked
[1:08:43.960 --> 1:08:44.960]  with.
[1:08:44.960 --> 1:08:46.960]  People say, well, why don't you give us his name?
[1:08:46.960 --> 1:08:48.960]  I deal with that with sources all the time.
[1:08:48.960 --> 1:08:55.120]  That's Journalism 101, is that if you ever give up your sources before a whistleblower
[1:08:55.120 --> 1:09:00.440]  gives you info, they go look and see if you've ever given up sources.
[1:09:00.440 --> 1:09:04.320]  So when I get a Department of Homeland Security internal document saying all veterans, gun
[1:09:04.320 --> 1:09:10.320]  owners, conservatives, are their number one enemy, libertarians, I don't, when I first
[1:09:10.320 --> 1:09:13.560]  broke that and the, and the Mayak report, people said, oh, it's not real.
[1:09:13.560 --> 1:09:17.360]  They called the phone numbers on it and they said, no, this is real, where'd you get it?
[1:09:17.360 --> 1:09:19.160]  And for two days, people didn't believe it was real.
[1:09:19.160 --> 1:09:21.600]  The national news picked it up.
[1:09:21.600 --> 1:09:23.080]  We can't give you our sources.
[1:09:23.080 --> 1:09:26.400]  A lot of times we have sources on the air, whistleblowers, you name it, if they want
[1:09:26.400 --> 1:09:28.040]  to go public.
[1:09:28.040 --> 1:09:32.240]  But we'll talk about why Lindsey thinks this guy's talking to him, but keep running through
[1:09:32.240 --> 1:09:36.680]  it all, then we'll go back through it and get blow by blow through what he told you.
[1:09:36.680 --> 1:09:37.680]  Go ahead, Lindsey Williams.
[1:09:37.680 --> 1:09:42.840]  Well, two years ago, Alex, when this gentleman called me and you remember that he threatened
[1:09:42.840 --> 1:09:47.200]  me and he said, Chaplain, you're saying some things that you can't say anymore.
[1:09:47.200 --> 1:09:50.320]  And he said, if you don't quit saying this and this and this, we are going to do this
[1:09:50.320 --> 1:09:51.320]  and this and this.
[1:09:51.320 --> 1:09:54.120]  I had not talked to the man in 25 years.
[1:09:54.120 --> 1:10:00.680]  I think it's satisfactory to say that after he and I agreed to agree and he said the
[1:10:00.680 --> 1:10:07.280]  price of, and then I said, by the way, how's your family, where have you been living, what
[1:10:07.280 --> 1:10:08.600]  are you doing?
[1:10:08.600 --> 1:10:12.960]  And he told me these things, he became friendly to me, and at that point, he said the price
[1:10:12.960 --> 1:10:16.960]  of crude oil is going from $147 to $50 a barrel.
[1:10:16.960 --> 1:10:21.560]  I think the mere fact of his credibility and saying that three months later, it took place
[1:10:21.560 --> 1:10:23.760]  exactly like he said.
[1:10:23.760 --> 1:10:27.680]  Even people in Wall Street said, you're crazy, it can't happen, it'll impact the world
[1:10:27.680 --> 1:10:29.040]  too much.
[1:10:29.040 --> 1:10:33.840]  But the mere fact of what this man said back then, you better believe what he's saying
[1:10:33.840 --> 1:10:34.840]  today too.
[1:10:34.840 --> 1:10:37.400]  It's going to take place exactly like he said it.
[1:10:37.400 --> 1:10:42.960]  And when he said to me, war will take place after two years.
[1:10:42.960 --> 1:10:47.480]  Now get his words well, war will take place after two years.
[1:10:47.480 --> 1:10:53.960]  It reminded me so much, Alex, of Major General Smedley Butler, who wrote the famous book.
[1:10:53.960 --> 1:10:59.600]  Eisenhower said that he said, I'm nothing compared to this Smedley Butler.
[1:10:59.600 --> 1:11:02.200]  He said, he is a man amongst men.
[1:11:02.200 --> 1:11:06.280]  President Eisenhower said that about him, it's Smedley Butler, wrote in his book.
[1:11:06.280 --> 1:11:09.040]  He said war is a racket, it always has been.
[1:11:09.040 --> 1:11:14.640]  It is possibly the oldest, easily the most profitable, surely the most vicious.
[1:11:14.640 --> 1:11:19.680]  It is the only one in which the profits are reckoned in dollars and the losses in lives.
[1:11:19.680 --> 1:11:23.680]  Only a small inside group knows what it is about.
[1:11:23.680 --> 1:11:29.200]  It is conducted for the benefit of the very few at the expense of the very many.
[1:11:29.200 --> 1:11:33.160]  Out of war, a few people make huge fortunes.
[1:11:33.160 --> 1:11:37.120]  And that's the first thing that came to my mind was what Smedley Butler had said when
[1:11:37.120 --> 1:11:41.400]  this man said, war will break out in approximately two years.
[1:11:41.400 --> 1:11:43.360]  It will begin in the Middle East.
[1:11:43.360 --> 1:11:46.320]  It will spread to the entire world.
[1:11:46.320 --> 1:11:50.080]  People, we have a maximum of two years.
[1:11:50.080 --> 1:11:54.520]  And if Alex and the others out there like him have not turned this country around in
[1:11:54.520 --> 1:12:00.880]  two years, well, if you have not risen up and rebelled against the tyrants within two years,
[1:12:00.880 --> 1:12:05.120]  and I'm quite sure you remember what was said by one of the great men of America in
[1:12:05.120 --> 1:12:10.440]  past years, he said rebellion to tyrants is obedience to God.
[1:12:10.440 --> 1:12:15.280]  That was Thomas Jefferson, one of the writers and founders of this country.
[1:12:15.280 --> 1:12:21.920]  And if we haven't risen up successfully in two years' time and turned this thing around,
[1:12:21.920 --> 1:12:23.280]  our republic is gone.
[1:12:23.280 --> 1:12:26.840]  Let me just add something about Smedley Butler.
[1:12:26.840 --> 1:12:32.440]  Two-time congressional medal of honor winner took over all these different nations for
[1:12:32.440 --> 1:12:37.520]  the globalist, and then they came to him in the mid-30s and said, we want to have a coup.
[1:12:37.520 --> 1:12:39.440]  We're going to link up with Hitler.
[1:12:39.440 --> 1:12:43.640]  We want you to lead 500,000 man army to take over the U.S.
[1:12:43.640 --> 1:12:48.080]  He played along until he could go to the McCormick-Dickstein committee and blow the whistle.
[1:12:48.080 --> 1:12:52.720]  That's mainline history, but it's not widely known and not widely taught, but it is mainline
[1:12:52.720 --> 1:12:54.600]  history.
[1:12:54.600 --> 1:13:00.400]  And Butler finally woke up like a lot of people in the Pentagon, like Fox Fallon, who
[1:13:00.400 --> 1:13:01.960]  was a big globalist.
[1:13:01.960 --> 1:13:05.960]  When they finally told the brass a few years ago, we're going to overthrow America, a lot
[1:13:05.960 --> 1:13:08.120]  of generals quit and left and are refusing.
[1:13:08.120 --> 1:13:14.960]  So there are a lot of aces in the hole out there, like Smedley Butler still.
[1:13:14.960 --> 1:13:18.680]  A lot of people we think are our friends are going to turn out not being our friends.
[1:13:18.680 --> 1:13:23.280]  A lot of people we didn't think were our friends are going to end up being our friends.
[1:13:23.280 --> 1:13:26.440]  And I just wanted to add that about Smedley Butler.
[1:13:26.440 --> 1:13:33.680]  And the Rand Corporation documents and others have stated that they do plan to stage a new
[1:13:33.680 --> 1:13:40.040]  war to help build their new world order, because a war will unify the people around the governments
[1:13:40.040 --> 1:13:41.160]  to follow their orders.
[1:13:41.160 --> 1:13:43.680]  Go ahead, Lindsey Williams.
[1:13:43.680 --> 1:13:46.040]  Well, you're exactly right.
[1:13:46.040 --> 1:13:51.120]  And they will unite everything together using this as the final straw that both the Camels
[1:13:51.120 --> 1:13:56.280]  back so to speak, because after they have an escalated inflation over two year period
[1:13:56.280 --> 1:14:00.920]  after they basically have buried the dollar, because now OPEC is not going to use it anymore.
[1:14:00.920 --> 1:14:01.920]  They're going to use it back.
[1:14:01.920 --> 1:14:06.760]  So if you protest, they're going to use the enemy sedition act saying we're at war.
[1:14:06.760 --> 1:14:11.920]  You can't protest the carbon tax and the citizen tattletales and they'll stage terror attacks
[1:14:11.920 --> 1:14:13.960]  and say the foreigners are doing it.
[1:14:13.960 --> 1:14:14.960]  This is their plan.
[1:14:14.960 --> 1:14:17.760]  Yes, that's exactly their plan.
[1:14:17.760 --> 1:14:20.840]  And everything that you have said, Alex is true.
[1:14:20.840 --> 1:14:22.240]  Oh my goodness.
[1:14:22.240 --> 1:14:26.320]  I wish I could open up the mind of every one of your audience out there and put into them
[1:14:26.320 --> 1:14:27.320]  point.
[1:14:27.320 --> 1:14:28.320]  You are saying is true.
[1:14:28.320 --> 1:14:32.440]  Yes, this is not just some alarmist out here.
[1:14:32.440 --> 1:14:33.440]  These are facts.
[1:14:33.440 --> 1:14:40.040]  And this gentleman just days ago backed up everything that you are saying, Alex.
[1:14:40.040 --> 1:14:43.760]  It's so amazing how that he basically said exactly what you said.
[1:14:43.760 --> 1:14:48.600]  But then I noticed on yesterday that something really kind of caught your ear.
[1:14:48.600 --> 1:14:53.680]  It was the expression that this man used, Devils Messiah.
[1:14:53.680 --> 1:15:00.280]  By the way, we've had a number of phone calls come into our 800 service, our toll free service.
[1:15:00.280 --> 1:15:07.280]  And they are fascinated with the idea that this man would use such an expression as Devils
[1:15:07.280 --> 1:15:08.280]  Messiah.
[1:15:08.280 --> 1:15:09.280]  Well, give us the data dump.
[1:15:09.280 --> 1:15:10.760]  Tell us specifically what he said.
[1:15:10.760 --> 1:15:11.760]  You've got the floor.
[1:15:11.760 --> 1:15:12.760]  Tell us.
[1:15:12.760 --> 1:15:13.760]  Yeah.
[1:15:13.760 --> 1:15:14.760]  Let me clarify just a little bit.
[1:15:14.760 --> 1:15:17.120]  He's not talking about a man.
[1:15:17.120 --> 1:15:18.800]  He's not talking about the Antichrist.
[1:15:18.800 --> 1:15:22.200]  No, no, I'm not one of those people at all.
[1:15:22.200 --> 1:15:24.560]  This isn't what this man was talking about.
[1:15:24.560 --> 1:15:31.840]  This man was talking about a system, a spirit, a deception that they have used over a period
[1:15:31.840 --> 1:15:32.960]  of years.
[1:15:32.960 --> 1:15:37.040]  And he went back and gave some things that I was appalled that he would give.
[1:15:37.040 --> 1:15:41.640]  In fact, I'm even wondering where this man that gave me this information, if maybe he
[1:15:41.640 --> 1:15:44.800]  hasn't had some change of heart as far as his-
[1:15:44.800 --> 1:15:46.640]  Well, specifically, word for word.
[1:15:46.640 --> 1:15:47.640]  Tell us what he said.
[1:15:47.640 --> 1:15:48.640]  Yeah.
[1:15:48.640 --> 1:15:51.720]  He said that the elite have taken away America's God.
[1:15:51.720 --> 1:15:53.520]  Now, here's what I did.
[1:15:53.520 --> 1:15:56.080]  I went back and I have it right here in my hand right now.
[1:15:56.080 --> 1:16:01.480]  The first textbook, I mean, this is how far this man went back and started enumerating.
[1:16:01.480 --> 1:16:06.080]  The first textbook ever used by our school in the United States of America was the original
[1:16:06.080 --> 1:16:07.760]  MacGuffin's Reader.
[1:16:07.760 --> 1:16:13.920]  And the MacGuffin Reader was written and the first schools in America that were ever held
[1:16:13.920 --> 1:16:20.800]  were established for the purpose of teaching people how to read, teaching them how to read
[1:16:20.800 --> 1:16:25.520]  so they could read the Bible and listen to just one section here out of the MacGuffin
[1:16:25.520 --> 1:16:26.520]  Reader.
[1:16:26.520 --> 1:16:29.000]  And this is the first textbook, by the way, of the American school.
[1:16:29.000 --> 1:16:31.000]  I wish we had it back again today.
[1:16:31.000 --> 1:16:34.720]  He says, oh my God, do not allow me to sin.
[1:16:34.720 --> 1:16:36.000]  Help me to do as I was told.
[1:16:36.000 --> 1:16:39.240]  This is on page 54 of the original MacGuffin Reader.
[1:16:39.240 --> 1:16:42.400]  He says, let me do unto others as I would have them do unto me.
[1:16:42.400 --> 1:16:44.720]  Our God can see all we do.
[1:16:44.720 --> 1:16:51.720]  God has an ear to all we say, let all I do be fit for his eye, and it goes on and on
[1:16:51.720 --> 1:16:52.720]  and on.
[1:16:52.720 --> 1:16:59.960]  He said, we had to remove, listen to this, folks, we had to remove the God of America
[1:16:59.960 --> 1:17:03.320]  before they could ever conquer the republic.
[1:17:03.320 --> 1:17:06.080]  And then go back and look at Webster's Dictionary.
[1:17:06.080 --> 1:17:10.800]  I have a picture of this in my new DVD, Webster's Dictionary.
[1:17:10.800 --> 1:17:16.800]  The original Webster's Dictionary was written for the purpose of preserving the language
[1:17:16.800 --> 1:17:22.080]  of the Scriptures so that the Bible would always have the same meaning regardless of
[1:17:22.080 --> 1:17:26.040]  how much time might change the way the people used the words.
[1:17:26.040 --> 1:17:31.800]  And I have a reproduction of the original Webster's Dictionary, big, huge book, written
[1:17:31.800 --> 1:17:36.560]  for the purpose of maintaining the language of the Scriptures.
[1:17:36.560 --> 1:17:39.240]  They had to remove all of this.
[1:17:39.240 --> 1:17:45.200]  They had to take away America's God, the devil's Messiah, and actually when he spoke of the
[1:17:45.200 --> 1:17:50.600]  devil's Messiah, he was talking about the system of what they have done in order to
[1:17:50.600 --> 1:17:56.400]  remove all righteousness, decency, and honesty from the government and from the political
[1:17:56.400 --> 1:17:59.040]  system of the United States of America.
[1:17:59.040 --> 1:18:02.520]  Then he went into the schools, oh my goodness, evolution.
[1:18:02.520 --> 1:18:04.680]  We talked about the subject of evolution.
[1:18:04.680 --> 1:18:09.840]  He said basically what they've done is they've caused human beings to think that their nation
[1:18:09.840 --> 1:18:13.120]  would evolutionize animals so that they will act like them.
[1:18:13.120 --> 1:18:16.280]  And that's exactly what they're acting like out on the streets now.
[1:18:16.280 --> 1:18:22.240]  Then he went into the churches, Alex, I wish you could have heard this conversation between
[1:18:22.240 --> 1:18:23.240]  the two of us.
[1:18:23.240 --> 1:18:28.000]  He went into the churches, he went back and talked about 501c3.
[1:18:28.000 --> 1:18:30.360]  Now, I remember this well.
[1:18:30.360 --> 1:18:36.800]  I was a pastor of Grace Baptist Church in Hollywood, Florida, at the time of 1964 when
[1:18:36.800 --> 1:18:44.720]  the government came in and said, we would like for you to accept a 501c3 organizational
[1:18:44.720 --> 1:18:52.600]  status so that we can grant all of your parishioners who give money to your church a tax deduction
[1:18:52.600 --> 1:18:53.600]  for them.
[1:18:53.600 --> 1:18:54.600]  They asked.
[1:18:54.600 --> 1:18:58.160]  They said, we'd like to ask you if you'd be willing to do this.
[1:18:58.160 --> 1:19:02.360]  Then about 1966 and 67, they required it.
[1:19:02.360 --> 1:19:03.360]  I never took it.
[1:19:03.360 --> 1:19:05.760]  As a pastor, I said, this is a trap.
[1:19:05.760 --> 1:19:08.800]  There's no way in this world I'm going to accept this.
[1:19:08.800 --> 1:19:12.000]  This was a part of the plan of the elite.
[1:19:12.000 --> 1:19:15.720]  They had to remove God from the schools, from education.
[1:19:15.720 --> 1:19:20.160]  They entered evolution so that humans make their evolutionized animals.
[1:19:20.160 --> 1:19:27.560]  Then they came over to the churches and deceived the pastors in 1964 and 65 with 501c3.
[1:19:27.560 --> 1:19:32.640]  By the way, folks, please, you've heard this expression, separation of church and state.
[1:19:32.640 --> 1:19:37.720]  I challenge you right now to go and read the Constitution of the United States of America
[1:19:37.720 --> 1:19:42.640]  and you tell me anywhere in that document that the expression, separation of church
[1:19:42.640 --> 1:19:44.920]  and state is used.
[1:19:44.920 --> 1:19:49.920]  We'll continue with how you talked about how they're federalizing the churches, having
[1:19:49.920 --> 1:19:55.760]  them fill out dossiers on their members straight ahead and then get into other areas in the
[1:19:55.760 --> 1:19:57.880]  notes you made that we haven't even covered yet.
[1:19:57.880 --> 1:20:00.120]  Lindsay Williams, stay with us.
[1:20:00.120 --> 1:20:02.800]  Do you have trouble getting through the day?
[1:20:02.800 --> 1:20:06.360]  Do you feel tired and worn out, pounding expensive energy drinks?
[1:20:06.360 --> 1:20:07.360]  It's a proven fact.
[1:20:07.360 --> 1:20:11.280]  Many people do not get the proper daily intake of essential vitamins and nutrients.
[1:20:11.280 --> 1:20:15.720]  With the lifestyles we lead, eating fruits and vegetables is sometimes easier said than
[1:20:15.720 --> 1:20:16.720]  done.
[1:20:16.720 --> 1:20:18.360]  Introducing Choose For Health.

[1:21:01.320 --> 1:21:03.320]  Mike Stenerson from Midas Resources.
[1:21:03.320 --> 1:21:06.240]  And no time in history have precious metals been more important.
[1:21:06.240 --> 1:21:08.840]  Certainly not my 17 years in the industry.
[1:21:08.840 --> 1:21:11.200]  Nearly 100 banks have been shuttered this year.
[1:21:11.200 --> 1:21:14.400]  As many as 200 more banks are suspect by year's end.
[1:21:14.400 --> 1:21:16.840]  The FDIC is operating in the red.
[1:21:16.840 --> 1:21:17.840]  Who pays for that?
[1:21:17.840 --> 1:21:19.120]  Is your money safe?
[1:21:19.120 --> 1:21:23.200]  The dollar has lost over 95% of its value in the last 60 years.
[1:21:23.200 --> 1:21:26.640]  No fiat currency has ever survived the government printing presses.
[1:21:26.640 --> 1:21:27.800]  Ours is not immune.
[1:21:27.800 --> 1:21:30.240]  The time is now to be proactive.
[1:21:30.240 --> 1:21:32.240]  Anything tied to the dollar is at risk.
[1:21:32.240 --> 1:21:37.280]  CDs, annuities, 401Ks, IRAs, stocks, bonds, you name it.
[1:21:37.280 --> 1:21:41.080]  So decide do you want to leave a legacy of wealth or debt for your family.
[1:21:41.080 --> 1:21:42.400]  The choice is yours.
[1:21:42.400 --> 1:21:47.720]  Call me at 1-800-686-2237, extension 116.
[1:21:47.720 --> 1:21:51.320]  Call 1-800-686-2237, extension 116.
[1:21:51.320 --> 1:21:54.720]  Be proactive, not reactive.
[1:21:54.720 --> 1:22:02.120]  Call 1-800-686-2237, extension 116.
[1:22:02.120 --> 1:22:05.880]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[1:22:05.880 --> 1:22:09.000]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[1:22:09.000 --> 1:22:13.360]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans
[1:22:13.360 --> 1:22:14.360]  at home.
[1:22:14.360 --> 1:22:19.400]  We've turned an endless influence on our president and Congress, and they really are calling
[1:22:19.400 --> 1:22:20.400]  the shots.
[1:22:20.400 --> 1:22:25.360]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[1:22:25.360 --> 1:22:30.840]  Full of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel
[1:22:30.840 --> 1:22:35.520]  held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[1:22:35.520 --> 1:22:37.920]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists.
[1:22:37.920 --> 1:22:42.040]  They're asking for more matches, and the Congress is saying, who do we make the checkout to?
[1:22:42.040 --> 1:22:47.440]  Today, it seems like nobody does care, and right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen
[1:22:47.440 --> 1:22:49.280]  a fall of the Republic.
[1:22:49.280 --> 1:22:55.360]  Get your copy of Full of the Republic on DVD at infowars.com or watch it online right

[1:23:00.240 --> 1:23:05.240]  If you believe Obama is creating runaway inflation, I'll tell you how to profit from this insanity
[1:23:05.240 --> 1:23:06.840]  with a free kit.
[1:23:06.840 --> 1:23:13.320]  Just the facts, Obama is spending like a drunken sailor, $700 billion for TARP, $122 billion
[1:23:13.320 --> 1:23:16.120]  for AIG, more for Fannie and Freddie.
[1:23:16.120 --> 1:23:17.120]  The result?
[1:23:17.120 --> 1:23:23.760]  A deficit of over $1.8 trillion and the probability of interest rates going above 18% and inflation
[1:23:23.760 --> 1:23:25.360]  above 20%.
[1:23:25.360 --> 1:23:29.880]  Now the good news, Scott Smith, the former chief investment analyst at Credit Suisse
[1:23:29.880 --> 1:23:35.560]  and editor of Swiss Confidential and Investment Newsletter, created a free inflation survival
[1:23:35.560 --> 1:23:36.560]  kit.
[1:23:36.560 --> 1:23:41.880]  He outlines how these circumstances created opportunities to turn $10,000 into as much
[1:23:41.880 --> 1:23:46.520]  as $431,000 in 12 to 18 months.
[1:23:46.520 --> 1:23:53.160]  If you're thinking about gold, get this free kit now by calling 888-314-8782.
[1:23:53.160 --> 1:24:10.200]  It's 888-314-8782 or go to the website inflationsurvivalkit.com.
[1:24:23.160 --> 1:24:47.880]  Just did a four minute radio interview, we try to cover all the bases here.
[1:24:47.880 --> 1:24:51.560]  Lindsey Williams is our guest, I want to open up the phones for Lindsey at the end of this
[1:24:51.560 --> 1:24:59.760]  hour, specifically quick questions for him, only for Lindsey, 1-800-259-9231.
[1:24:59.760 --> 1:25:02.920]  By the way, we've sent Lindsey back up for Friday, haven't we?
[1:25:02.920 --> 1:25:06.720]  What time is he on Friday so I can plug that?
[1:25:06.720 --> 1:25:09.320]  One o'clock so we can break more of this down central time.
[1:25:09.320 --> 1:25:12.800]  Okay, Lindsey, short segment, long segment coming up.
[1:25:12.800 --> 1:25:17.640]  I need to, okay, so just so you said taking over the churches, because even if you don't
[1:25:17.640 --> 1:25:22.280]  believe in Christ or Christianity or even Buddha or Muhammad or any of that, they're
[1:25:22.280 --> 1:25:29.440]  attacking all of those, but especially Christianity, because if you don't owe allegiance to a God,
[1:25:29.440 --> 1:25:32.760]  you'll owe it to a state, or if you don't owe allegiance to your family, you'll owe
[1:25:32.760 --> 1:25:33.760]  it to the state.
[1:25:33.760 --> 1:25:37.920]  They're wrecking anything that they don't control, but using the churches as you said
[1:25:37.920 --> 1:25:40.880]  with the clergy response teams, finish up with that.
[1:25:40.880 --> 1:25:44.640]  Let's get into the chronology and other things he said, because we didn't get to all of it
[1:25:44.640 --> 1:25:45.640]  yesterday.
[1:25:45.640 --> 1:25:50.600]  Alex, I'm going to save until Friday the subject of money.
[1:25:50.600 --> 1:25:52.200]  Now, I haven't even touched on it.
[1:25:52.200 --> 1:25:54.280]  I didn't touch on it yesterday.
[1:25:54.280 --> 1:25:58.800]  I am dealing with another subject today, and I'm so glad you're going to take calls at
[1:25:58.800 --> 1:26:00.600]  the end of the program.
[1:26:00.600 --> 1:26:05.440]  Everybody in the listening audience, I'm wanting you right now, please be here on Friday.
[1:26:05.440 --> 1:26:11.840]  I have not even told you anything about the money side of this whole situation, and the
[1:26:11.840 --> 1:26:15.040]  most sensitive part of anybody is an atomizer, real pocket.
[1:26:15.040 --> 1:26:20.280]  Now, on Friday, I will take the entire one-hour program that Alex is allowing me to be on
[1:26:20.280 --> 1:26:25.440]  with him, and I'm going to talk about nothing, but what this man said to me about money.
[1:26:25.440 --> 1:26:28.760]  I am going to give you a chronological order.
[1:26:28.760 --> 1:26:32.120]  Now, please understand this, and if you have any trouble with this word, look it up.
[1:26:32.120 --> 1:26:33.320]  I know it's a big one.
[1:26:33.320 --> 1:26:39.320]  I'm going to give a schedule of events in chronological order over the next two years
[1:26:39.320 --> 1:26:45.600]  of what you can expect in relation to your money, your 501s, all of these retirement
[1:26:45.600 --> 1:26:48.200]  programs, everything else imaginable.
[1:26:48.200 --> 1:26:52.200]  We did get into this subject, and so now, I'm going to go back to this, but I just thought
[1:26:52.200 --> 1:26:53.200]  I needed to say that.
[1:26:53.200 --> 1:26:54.200]  And by the way, I was wrong.
[1:26:54.200 --> 1:26:55.560]  You're on it noon central.
[1:26:55.560 --> 1:26:56.560]  Go ahead.
[1:26:56.560 --> 1:26:57.560]  Yeah.
[1:26:57.560 --> 1:27:02.000]  If you're on the program today, please, you will want to be back here on Friday.
[1:27:02.000 --> 1:27:04.400]  Let's cover all the other areas, because a lot we haven't covered.
[1:27:04.400 --> 1:27:08.560]  Finish up with the church, takeover, and then let's go to the other issues.
[1:27:08.560 --> 1:27:12.880]  And somewhere in your constitution, anywhere you can, you read it from end to end, you
[1:27:12.880 --> 1:27:17.440]  need to read it anyway, see if you can find the word separation of church and state.
[1:27:17.440 --> 1:27:22.520]  Now, one of the first things I learned when I lived with the elite back at Fruto years
[1:27:22.520 --> 1:27:26.480]  ago and had an opportunity to sit across the dinner table from these people, sit in
[1:27:26.480 --> 1:27:27.480]  that board meeting.
[1:27:27.480 --> 1:27:34.200]  One of the things I learned was, listen to their buzz words, nowhere in the constitution
[1:27:34.200 --> 1:27:40.520]  of the United States of America, will you find the expression separation between or
[1:27:40.520 --> 1:27:42.880]  separation off church and state.
[1:27:42.880 --> 1:27:49.200]  It is a buzz word, they've planted it in your mind, they've caused the pastors to think.
[1:27:49.200 --> 1:27:56.160]  You see, in the constitution and in the writings of our founding fathers, the state was ordered
[1:27:56.160 --> 1:27:59.000]  not to get involved with the church.
[1:27:59.000 --> 1:28:04.960]  The state was told to quit meddling, never meddle with the church, but the church was
[1:28:04.960 --> 1:28:07.920]  allowed to meddle in the state all they wanted to.
[1:28:07.920 --> 1:28:11.120]  Pastors used to preach electoral sermons.
[1:28:11.120 --> 1:28:15.680]  They talked about candidates, you can't do that today, your hands are bound, you are
[1:28:15.680 --> 1:28:16.680]  literally tied.
[1:28:16.680 --> 1:28:20.920]  The first amendment says, Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion
[1:28:20.920 --> 1:28:23.000]  or prohibiting a free exercise thereof.
[1:28:23.000 --> 1:28:26.200]  That means no jurisdiction for government.
[1:28:26.200 --> 1:28:30.080]  And how long are you pastors going to sit out there and be panzers?
[1:28:30.080 --> 1:28:36.080]  Now, please forgive me, I've been a pastor for 50 years or a minister of some type, 50
[1:28:36.080 --> 1:28:41.240]  years time, and I'm a graduate of a good Christian Bible college in college.
[1:28:41.240 --> 1:28:45.080]  Folks, please, get off your duff.
[1:28:45.080 --> 1:28:49.640]  Pastors, you ought to be preaching electoral sermons, you ought to be talking about prostitution,
[1:28:49.640 --> 1:28:53.200]  you ought to be talking about what's happening to our republic, you ought to be out there
[1:28:53.200 --> 1:28:57.800]  learning and teaching courses on the constitution in your church.
[1:28:57.800 --> 1:29:04.080]  If you don't, Homeland Security has you right where they want you, you are under their finger.
[1:29:04.080 --> 1:29:09.000]  And whenever you, again, one of these Homeland Security meetings, and they suggest to you
[1:29:09.000 --> 1:29:13.440]  that you should need to go and get all this information from your churches, don't even
[1:29:13.440 --> 1:29:19.320]  realize that they are going to use this to the destruction of your church members whenever
[1:29:19.320 --> 1:29:24.720]  they get ready to perform what they want to do in pulling the strings two years from now
[1:29:24.720 --> 1:29:28.200]  pastors, you are getting set up.
[1:29:28.200 --> 1:29:31.920]  You literally are being used as pawns.
[1:29:31.920 --> 1:29:36.800]  This man went into this separation of church and state, there is no such thing.
[1:29:36.800 --> 1:29:38.840]  In fact, the state ought to stay out of the church.
[1:29:38.840 --> 1:29:42.080]  You have no business having a Bible, one C three.
[1:29:42.080 --> 1:29:47.200]  In fact, you should be meddling in the state and telling your congressman what to do and
[1:29:47.200 --> 1:29:48.200]  defend themselves.
[1:29:48.200 --> 1:29:51.240]  Let's get into, let's get into other areas when we come back.
[1:29:51.240 --> 1:29:58.400]  We're on the march, the empires on the run, Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[1:29:58.400 --> 1:30:04.120]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[1:30:04.120 --> 1:30:08.460]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition
[1:30:08.460 --> 1:30:09.460]  do you want?
[1:30:09.460 --> 1:30:15.000]  My answer would be all I can get in the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones.
[1:30:15.000 --> 1:30:16.480]  Food is your only ammunition.
[1:30:16.480 --> 1:30:17.720]  How much do you want?
[1:30:17.720 --> 1:30:18.720]  When do you want it?
[1:30:18.720 --> 1:30:20.760]  Now or after the battle starts?
[1:30:20.760 --> 1:30:21.880]  When will you need it?
[1:30:21.880 --> 1:30:24.000]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[1:30:24.000 --> 1:30:25.360]  Will there be any food?
[1:30:25.360 --> 1:30:26.800]  Will it make your children sick?
[1:30:26.800 --> 1:30:30.940]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center
[1:30:30.940 --> 1:30:32.100]  and be immunized?
[1:30:32.100 --> 1:30:35.880]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[1:30:35.880 --> 1:30:39.480]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[1:30:39.480 --> 1:30:40.720]  How much will you need?
[1:30:40.720 --> 1:30:41.720]  We don't know.
[1:30:41.720 --> 1:30:42.720]  How much do you want?
[1:30:42.720 --> 1:30:43.720]  All you can get.
[1:30:43.720 --> 1:30:44.720]  I'm Alex Jones.
[1:30:44.720 --> 1:30:52.400]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day, call 1-800-409-5633 or check it
[1:30:52.400 --> 1:31:00.120]  out on the web at eFoodsDirect.com, again that number 1-800-409-5633.
[1:31:00.120 --> 1:31:04.800]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want
[1:31:04.800 --> 1:31:05.800]  you to eat.
[1:31:05.800 --> 1:31:09.320]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you
[1:31:09.320 --> 1:31:10.320]  sick?
[1:31:10.320 --> 1:31:12.240]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[1:31:12.240 --> 1:31:13.920]  You don't have to cooperate.
[1:31:13.920 --> 1:31:15.200]  There is a solution.
[1:31:15.200 --> 1:31:18.800]  Inner health botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing
[1:31:18.800 --> 1:31:23.600]  products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.

[1:31:28.720 --> 1:31:31.000]  energy you need and will keep you well.

[1:31:36.200 --> 1:31:37.200]  manager.
[1:31:37.200 --> 1:31:41.920]  I love their NutriCafe, great organic coffee infused with herbal extracts to boost your
[1:31:41.920 --> 1:31:43.120]  immune system.

[1:32:00.040 --> 1:32:04.160]  This is Alex Jones, and I want to tell you all about a cola blue, the state of the art
[1:32:04.160 --> 1:32:08.760]  atmospheric waters generators that produces purified drinking water right from the humidity
[1:32:08.760 --> 1:32:09.920]  in the air you breathe.
[1:32:09.920 --> 1:32:11.720]  No, this isn't science fiction.
[1:32:11.720 --> 1:32:12.720]  It's very real.
[1:32:12.720 --> 1:32:17.600]  I know, I use one every day in my own home, and it's available right now to you.
[1:32:17.600 --> 1:32:20.640]  Clean great tasting water without all the pollutants.
[1:32:20.640 --> 1:32:24.840]  Make the decision today to claim your own water independence by ordering your own a
[1:32:24.840 --> 1:32:29.280]  cola blue atmospheric water generator for your home or business, just like I did.
[1:32:29.280 --> 1:32:34.440]  Their best seller, the a cola blue 28, produces up to 7 gallons of water every day and is easy
[1:32:34.440 --> 1:32:36.000]  to use and economical.
[1:32:36.000 --> 1:32:40.640]  This system is free of chemicals and uses a multi-stage filtration system, including
[1:32:40.640 --> 1:32:44.960]  reverse osmosis, carbon filters, and ultraviolet lights.
[1:32:44.960 --> 1:32:49.280]  Generate your own pure water right from the humidity in the air by calling a cola blue
[1:32:49.280 --> 1:32:59.240]  at 1-800-691-6043, that's 1-800-691-6043, or visit a cola blue on the web at ECOLOBLUE.com
[1:32:59.240 --> 1:33:00.240]  today.
[1:33:00.240 --> 1:33:07.000]  While ever become a reality in America, some fear any nuclear, biological, or chemical
[1:33:07.000 --> 1:33:10.840]  attack on U.S. territory might trigger just that.
[1:33:10.840 --> 1:33:14.920]  And as KSLA News 12 Jeff Ferrell discovered, the clergy would help the government with
[1:33:14.920 --> 1:33:18.000]  potentially their biggest problem, us.
[1:33:18.000 --> 1:33:21.360]  From my cold, yet you have me.
[1:33:21.360 --> 1:33:27.400]  Charlton Heston's famous declaration captures a truly American value, the overarching desire
[1:33:27.400 --> 1:33:29.360]  to protect our freedoms.
[1:33:29.360 --> 1:33:34.400]  But gun confiscation is exactly what happened during the state of emergency following Hurricane
[1:33:34.400 --> 1:33:35.960]  Katrina in New Orleans.
[1:33:35.960 --> 1:33:41.920]  U.S. troops also arrived, something far easier to do even now thanks to last year's elimination
[1:33:41.920 --> 1:33:45.400]  of the 1878 Posse Commitatus Act.
[1:33:45.400 --> 1:33:50.720]  That forbid U.S. troops from policing on American soil.
[1:33:50.720 --> 1:33:55.160]  If martial law weren't enacted here at home, like depicted in the movie The Siege, easing
[1:33:55.160 --> 1:33:58.400]  public fears and quelling dissent would be critical.
[1:33:58.400 --> 1:34:02.920]  And that's exactly what the clergy response team, as it's called, helped accomplish in
[1:34:02.920 --> 1:34:03.920]  New Orleans.
[1:34:03.920 --> 1:34:07.480]  Jeff, the primary thing that we say to anybody is let's cooperate and get this thing over
[1:34:07.480 --> 1:34:10.920]  with, and then we'll settle the differences once the crisis is over.
[1:34:10.920 --> 1:34:15.600]  Such clergy response teams would walk a tightrope between the needs of the government versus
[1:34:15.600 --> 1:34:17.240]  the wishes of the public.
[1:34:17.240 --> 1:34:21.920]  In a lot of cases, these clergy would already be known in the neighborhoods in which they're
[1:34:21.920 --> 1:34:24.360]  helping to diffuse that situation.
[1:34:24.360 --> 1:34:28.520]  For the clergy, one of the biggest tools that they will have in helping calm the public
[1:34:28.520 --> 1:34:35.760]  down or obey the law is the Bible itself, specifically Romans, Romans 13.
[1:34:35.760 --> 1:34:39.440]  Because the government has established all the law, you know, and that's what we believe
[1:34:39.440 --> 1:34:40.440]  in the Christian faith.
[1:34:40.440 --> 1:34:42.000]  That's what's stated in the scripture.
[1:34:42.000 --> 1:34:47.080]  Civil rights advocates believe the amount of public cooperation may depend largely on
[1:34:47.080 --> 1:34:51.760]  how long they expect a suspension of their rights might last.
[1:34:51.760 --> 1:34:54.480]  Jeff Farrell, KSLA News 12 reporting.
[1:34:54.480 --> 1:34:58.880]  Coming to Tuporville during Hurricane Katrina, the clergy response team provided 38 chaplains
[1:34:58.880 --> 1:35:02.560]  a day around the clock at eight different camps.
[1:35:02.560 --> 1:35:16.520]  Cyrus Jones from 1810 to 1913 made his great-grandchildren believe you could live to 103.
[1:35:16.520 --> 1:35:22.920]  103 is forever when you're just a little kid.
[1:35:22.920 --> 1:35:27.040]  So, Cyrus Jones lived forever.
[1:35:27.040 --> 1:35:28.040]  Grave digger.
[1:35:28.040 --> 1:35:29.040]  Grave digger.
[1:35:29.040 --> 1:35:34.680]  When you dig my grave, would you make a shout out to me?
[1:35:34.680 --> 1:35:36.280]  We're going to be taking your phone calls for Lindsey.
[1:35:36.280 --> 1:35:39.080]  He'll be back with us on Friday to go through the rest of the timeline.
[1:35:39.080 --> 1:35:42.760]  We're going to do some other areas he hasn't covered yet, but I wanted to play that clergy
[1:35:42.760 --> 1:35:45.000]  response team clip backing up what Lindsey was talking about.
[1:35:45.000 --> 1:35:48.960]  Before we go any further, I want to say about a few of our sponsors.
[1:35:48.960 --> 1:35:54.520]  One of them has a link up on infowars.com, write this name down.
[1:35:54.520 --> 1:35:58.160]  I don't claim to be a medical doctor or anything about it, but I've had medical doctors on
[1:35:58.160 --> 1:36:03.440]  that have pointed out there's one thing out there that's natural, it's antiviral and antibacterial,
[1:36:03.440 --> 1:36:05.320]  and that's colloidal silver.
[1:36:05.320 --> 1:36:09.880]  And the silver lung system we have here is an inhaler, and it's a great sponsor.
[1:36:09.880 --> 1:36:15.120]  You should find out more at silverlungs.com, S-I-L-V-E-R-L-U-N-G-S.com, silverlungs.com.

[1:36:53.080 --> 1:37:01.400]  That's equadorcentral.com, equador is spelled E-C-U-A-D-O-R, equador, as in the South American
[1:37:01.400 --> 1:37:04.880]  country, equadorcentral.com.

[1:37:31.520 --> 1:37:40.960]  And again, we are 26 hours and 22 minutes away.
[1:37:40.960 --> 1:37:47.520]  At three o'clock central tomorrow, we're going to launch Fall of the Republic at prismplanet.tv.

[1:37:58.840 --> 1:38:01.200]  who these people are.
[1:38:01.200 --> 1:38:05.760]  How to stop them, what their overall game plan is, how they've mesmerized the public,
[1:38:05.760 --> 1:38:11.480]  infowars.com to order prismplanet.tv to watch it online.
[1:38:11.480 --> 1:38:22.720]  And you can also call 888-253-3139, 888-253-3139, or write to me, Alex Jones, at PO Box 19549,
[1:38:22.720 --> 1:38:24.720]  Austin, Texas, 787-60.
[1:38:24.720 --> 1:38:30.200]  Okay, Lindsay, I want to go to David, Eric, Jim, Matt, and Jim.
[1:38:30.200 --> 1:38:34.160]  And at least those five calls, those first five on the board, and have quick questions
[1:38:34.160 --> 1:38:35.160]  from you can answer.
[1:38:35.160 --> 1:38:38.880]  And on Friday, we'll finish up with the timeline and what he said would happen with money.
[1:38:38.880 --> 1:38:41.800]  But there's other areas of this to cover briefly.
[1:38:41.800 --> 1:38:45.800]  Some of the areas we haven't gotten into yet, some of the other notes from your discussion
[1:38:45.800 --> 1:38:50.520]  with this insider on things he said, other areas we haven't covered, Lindsay.
[1:38:50.520 --> 1:38:55.880]  Before the election, I was told that McCain is all of a man.
[1:38:55.880 --> 1:38:56.880]  Well, they didn't get him.
[1:38:56.880 --> 1:39:01.480]  You see, the elite are not defined.
[1:39:01.480 --> 1:39:06.560]  This new president we've got now, he made the statement the other day, Obama said, America
[1:39:06.560 --> 1:39:08.560]  is a Muslim nation.
[1:39:08.560 --> 1:39:14.240]  I beg your pardon, Mr. Obama, America is not a Muslim nation.
[1:39:14.240 --> 1:39:20.640]  And George Whitfield, a great reformer back in the early days of America, had a great
[1:39:20.640 --> 1:39:23.120]  influence on Benjamin Franklin.
[1:39:23.120 --> 1:39:25.440]  And I won't take time to read Benjamin Franklin's statement.
[1:39:25.440 --> 1:39:28.920]  There's about a paragraph long here, but I know we're getting along with time.
[1:39:28.920 --> 1:39:31.160]  This is one area I haven't covered.
[1:39:31.160 --> 1:39:35.280]  And what we've got to have, and there's only one way to turn all this around, we've got
[1:39:35.280 --> 1:39:38.360]  to have divine intervention.
[1:39:38.360 --> 1:39:39.680]  But it must be turned around.
[1:39:39.680 --> 1:39:43.480]  Or we're going to lose the Republic just as Alex is talking about.
[1:39:43.480 --> 1:39:47.320]  So this is one of the areas we haven't covered yet.
[1:39:47.320 --> 1:39:48.800]  And I don't know where to go from there.
[1:39:48.800 --> 1:39:52.320]  I know we've got a lot of phone calls here, Alex, so maybe you want to take them.
[1:39:52.320 --> 1:39:56.600]  Well, we're going to go over that timeline and detail on Friday, but go over some of
[1:39:56.600 --> 1:39:59.240]  that timeline of what he said was going to happen.
[1:39:59.240 --> 1:40:00.920]  Let me, let's do that now, Lindsay.
[1:40:00.920 --> 1:40:01.920]  Okay.
[1:40:01.920 --> 1:40:06.040]  Let's see if I can find some timeline notes here right quick.
[1:40:06.040 --> 1:40:08.080]  I gave them all the other day on our DVD.
[1:40:08.080 --> 1:40:11.680]  Well, by the way, we're going to give that number out in a moment, but people should
[1:40:11.680 --> 1:40:12.680]  get ready.
[1:40:12.680 --> 1:40:13.680]  But I mean, let's cover some of that now.
[1:40:13.680 --> 1:40:14.680]  People need to know this now.
[1:40:14.680 --> 1:40:18.680]  And then we'll flesh it all out Friday, but I just know you should get page after page
[1:40:18.680 --> 1:40:19.680]  of notes.
[1:40:19.680 --> 1:40:21.680]  I want to, more of what he told you.
[1:40:21.680 --> 1:40:22.680]  Yeah.
[1:40:22.680 --> 1:40:26.160]  When you see more and more people working for the federal government, the more you see
[1:40:26.160 --> 1:40:30.400]  working for the federal government, the more they put on their payroll through everything
[1:40:30.400 --> 1:40:35.440]  like General Motors Christ, the little banks, the healthcare system, all the rest, the closer
[1:40:35.440 --> 1:40:38.120]  you know you're getting to it, the stock market.
[1:40:38.120 --> 1:40:42.600]  The stock market will continue to go up and up and up and up.
[1:40:42.600 --> 1:40:46.960]  And whenever it gets to a peak, you will probably, I don't know what the peak will
[1:40:46.960 --> 1:40:47.960]  be.
[1:40:47.960 --> 1:40:48.960]  It didn't give me a number.
[1:40:48.960 --> 1:40:53.040]  However, you see this get so high that it's getting utterly ridiculous.
[1:40:53.040 --> 1:40:57.600]  Watch out, because at that point, we'll probably be at the end of this two year period.
[1:40:57.600 --> 1:40:59.440]  And you're going to see a major crash.
[1:40:59.440 --> 1:41:04.360]  Well, that makes perfect sense in the midst of Main Street dying and the midst of everything
[1:41:04.360 --> 1:41:08.720]  falling apart and the government federalizing everything with fiat currency at Prince up
[1:41:08.720 --> 1:41:11.920]  and all these select corporations operating with contracts.
[1:41:11.920 --> 1:41:15.960]  If you don't have the contract or you can't get the carbon tax allotment, you're shut
[1:41:15.960 --> 1:41:16.960]  down.
[1:41:16.960 --> 1:41:19.000]  And that's what they're doing in their own documents.
[1:41:19.000 --> 1:41:23.520]  They will run the stock market up as that image of everything being okay when really
[1:41:23.520 --> 1:41:27.480]  it's only jacked up because it's reflecting devalued dollars.
[1:41:27.480 --> 1:41:30.120]  Just like gold isn't really up in price.
[1:41:30.120 --> 1:41:32.440]  It's that the dollar is dropping in value.
[1:41:32.440 --> 1:41:38.120]  Yes, that's right, gold, whenever you, well, a few moments ago, we were talking about the
[1:41:38.120 --> 1:41:42.160]  price of gold today, a thousand and whatever was 50 or 60 dollars.
[1:41:42.160 --> 1:41:43.640]  No gold is not increased at all.
[1:41:43.640 --> 1:41:49.200]  The dollar has only decreased, but gold still buys the same thing it would buy 30, 40 years
[1:41:49.200 --> 1:41:50.200]  ago.
[1:41:50.200 --> 1:41:52.960]  One ounce gold will still buy that brand new suit.
[1:41:52.960 --> 1:41:58.520]  But that much of American paper won't buy you anything.
[1:41:58.520 --> 1:42:04.120]  Let's see, you are going to see our currency continue to go down in value.
[1:42:04.120 --> 1:42:10.920]  And when you see this dropping very rapidly, watch out, you're getting pretty close to
[1:42:10.920 --> 1:42:15.760]  this time, reserve currency status.
[1:42:15.760 --> 1:42:19.600]  America is losing it very rapidly and you will see it lose it even faster.
[1:42:19.600 --> 1:42:21.520]  Oh, I said something on yesterday.
[1:42:21.520 --> 1:42:24.760]  I need to elaborate on it again very briefly right here.
[1:42:24.760 --> 1:42:27.520]  Alex, one of the last people that they're going to touch is you.
[1:42:27.520 --> 1:42:32.800]  Now, I know everybody thinks, well, I've got personality complex here.
[1:42:32.800 --> 1:42:35.800]  They're going to get us next, no, they aren't.
[1:42:35.800 --> 1:42:45.720]  I've been let know that the media will not, the mass media, the secular media, they know
[1:42:45.720 --> 1:42:50.680]  if they touch you, that likewise they lose their freedom also and one thing that they
[1:42:50.680 --> 1:42:55.560]  must have, they must have the media out there to be able to convince you.
[1:42:55.560 --> 1:43:00.120]  The media is their method of getting you all the information that they want.
[1:43:00.120 --> 1:43:04.080]  Well, Lindsay, it's already confirmed that tens of billions are spent in sitcoms and
[1:43:04.080 --> 1:43:10.960]  dramas and news being paid by the federal government to put anti-gun, anti-family, pro-Euthanasia,
[1:43:10.960 --> 1:43:13.320]  pro-carbon tax messages.
[1:43:13.320 --> 1:43:14.480]  That's all admitted now.
[1:43:14.480 --> 1:43:16.480]  That's publicly declassified.
[1:43:16.480 --> 1:43:18.040]  So, so exactly.
[1:43:18.040 --> 1:43:20.380]  They think they've got total domination.
[1:43:20.380 --> 1:43:24.600]  If they shut me down, it highlights everything I've said.
[1:43:24.600 --> 1:43:27.200]  Instead they just ignore it.
[1:43:27.200 --> 1:43:28.280]  That's correct.
[1:43:28.280 --> 1:43:32.840]  And this is what I was led to believe that they're not going to bother you, talk to
[1:43:32.840 --> 1:43:37.200]  a host, they're not going to stop me from saying, this man, let me know this material.
[1:43:37.200 --> 1:43:39.560]  I'm amazed that he dared to do it.
[1:43:39.560 --> 1:43:42.360]  And the media is their method of getting their word out.
[1:43:42.360 --> 1:43:49.240]  They know if they touch them, the public, the media in Washington, all over the country,
[1:43:49.240 --> 1:43:54.800]  secular media, that they cannot stop you without stopping them also.
[1:43:54.800 --> 1:43:56.080]  So praise the Lord.
[1:43:56.080 --> 1:43:59.800]  One of the final things that you'll have is a shutdown.
[1:43:59.800 --> 1:44:04.320]  If they ever stop, shut down, start to shut down Alex Jones and others like him.
[1:44:04.320 --> 1:44:05.320]  You watch out.
[1:44:05.320 --> 1:44:06.320]  You've had it.
[1:44:06.320 --> 1:44:07.320]  I mean, that definitely is the end.
[1:44:07.320 --> 1:44:08.320]  That's the last thing they'll do.
[1:44:08.320 --> 1:44:10.600]  Did he say they are planning that?
[1:44:10.600 --> 1:44:11.600]  Hold on.
[1:44:11.600 --> 1:44:14.360]  Did they say they are planning that later, though?
[1:44:14.360 --> 1:44:15.360]  Oh, positively.
[1:44:15.360 --> 1:44:21.600]  Oh, whenever you've got the next war, in fact, whenever they create this crisis that's supposed
[1:44:21.600 --> 1:44:27.320]  to take place after two years, and you made a plan, they have, war is planned, war is
[1:44:27.320 --> 1:44:28.320]  in the order.
[1:44:28.320 --> 1:44:30.920]  They haven't even said where it's going to begin in the Middle East and spread through
[1:44:30.920 --> 1:44:31.920]  the world.
[1:44:31.920 --> 1:44:33.320]  Whenever that happens, it's over.
[1:44:33.320 --> 1:44:36.000]  I mean, you may as well chalk it up at that point.
[1:44:36.000 --> 1:44:42.440]  If the American people and the public have not risen up and had bigger than Tea Party,
[1:44:42.440 --> 1:44:53.040]  listen, I don't know how to say it, this King George, he merely put a tax on tea and the
[1:44:53.040 --> 1:44:58.040]  American people rose up and had the Boston Tea Party, and you gave them two and one-half
[1:44:58.040 --> 1:45:01.960]  trillion dollars in the last two months of the Bush administration, and you didn't even
[1:45:01.960 --> 1:45:04.280]  rise up at all and didn't do anything about it.
[1:45:04.280 --> 1:45:10.720]  Folks, I get alarmed whenever I talk about things like this, and you just sit there with
[1:45:10.720 --> 1:45:17.160]  your jail, be job, just overbroke, you sit there and let them do this to you.
[1:45:17.160 --> 1:45:22.720]  You listen to Alex Jones' day after day, and you're not taking up action against these
[1:45:22.720 --> 1:45:23.720]  people.
[1:45:23.720 --> 1:45:26.560]  Well, I think our listeners are, I just think it's the general public.
[1:45:26.560 --> 1:45:31.960]  I mean, I made the point, I went Saturday night with my children, we went over to Michael's,
[1:45:31.960 --> 1:45:37.680]  the art store, to buy some more paints and pen and ink, because the kids paint almost
[1:45:37.680 --> 1:45:43.600]  every day, and then I went to Michael's and I walked over afterwards, my wife was home,
[1:45:43.600 --> 1:45:48.760]  but I took the kids out myself, and I went and got them food and sat down at Jason's
[1:45:48.760 --> 1:45:54.680]  deli, and every person, including people behind the counter, were wearing UT football jerseys,
[1:45:54.680 --> 1:45:59.640]  which is fine, but they've had their tribalism, they've had their raw, raw, you've got that
[1:45:59.640 --> 1:46:04.040]  raw, raw instinct to defend your freedom, but they take it and misappropriate it.
[1:46:04.040 --> 1:46:07.680]  If I could get people to wear shirts with the Bill of Rights on it, if I could get it to
[1:46:07.680 --> 1:46:12.240]  be as exciting to stand up against tyranny, that's your whole future, that's your job,
[1:46:12.240 --> 1:46:15.280]  that's your children, that's a government trying to make you take shots.
[1:46:15.280 --> 1:46:20.320]  I like football as much as the next person, but how can I morally just sit around three,
[1:46:20.320 --> 1:46:25.440]  four nights a week watching sports on my whole country and the whole world falls to the hands
[1:46:25.440 --> 1:46:26.440]  of the New World Order?
[1:46:26.440 --> 1:46:29.960]  Let's, let's take some calls and we'll go through the entire chronology and finish
[1:46:29.960 --> 1:46:34.200]  other areas we haven't hit on Friday with Lindsey Williams at high noon, second hour
[1:46:34.200 --> 1:46:35.200]  here on the show.
[1:46:35.200 --> 1:46:39.800]  But before we go to David, Eric, Jim, Matt and Jim, we're going to keep you to five
[1:46:39.800 --> 1:46:46.480]  minutes into the next hour, then David Ray Griffin's joining us before we do that.
[1:46:46.480 --> 1:46:50.240]  Lindsey, because you haven't plugged this yet and I want you to, I know as soon as you
[1:46:50.240 --> 1:46:57.320]  learned this last week, you ran in, hired a studio, did a three DVD set, laying out
[1:46:57.320 --> 1:47:03.400]  this whole thing and you talk about your other videos being dorky, well, speak for yourself.
[1:47:03.400 --> 1:47:07.840]  Your presentation on what was going to happen with oil was seen tens of millions of times
[1:47:07.840 --> 1:47:10.960]  and that's why you got death threaded over it by these people.
[1:47:10.960 --> 1:47:11.960]  And then that was a blessing.
[1:47:11.960 --> 1:47:13.800]  You learned all this other info.
[1:47:13.800 --> 1:47:18.760]  So I think people should call the toll free number and get this new three DVD set.
[1:47:18.760 --> 1:47:21.000]  You're just now putting out just now available.
[1:47:21.000 --> 1:47:22.880]  Give people the toll free number to get it.
[1:47:22.880 --> 1:47:33.240]  The toll free number is a new toll free number, 888-799-6111.
[1:47:33.240 --> 1:47:35.280]  Now we have seven operators standing by right now.
[1:47:35.280 --> 1:47:37.120]  I called them this morning.
[1:47:37.120 --> 1:47:43.720]  We had marvelous response on yesterday folks, six DVDs, yes, my three new ones, nothing
[1:47:43.720 --> 1:47:44.720]  from the past.
[1:47:44.720 --> 1:47:47.680]  You're not getting anything you've ever gotten from me before.
[1:47:47.680 --> 1:47:49.160]  All of this is brand new.
[1:47:49.160 --> 1:47:52.000]  I'm giving you three DVDs as a gift.
[1:47:52.000 --> 1:47:57.800]  You purchased my three DVDs I made last week in studio, professionally done, numerous cameras,
[1:47:57.800 --> 1:48:01.240]  beautiful, full color cover on the outside of our program.
[1:48:01.240 --> 1:48:03.880]  I mean, you've never seen us do anything this professionally.
[1:48:03.880 --> 1:48:13.240]  The number is toll free, new number, 888-799-6111.
[1:48:13.240 --> 1:48:16.200]  I beg of you, copy these DVDs.
[1:48:16.200 --> 1:48:18.200]  They are not copy written.
[1:48:18.200 --> 1:48:20.800]  I plead with you, get millions of them out.
[1:48:20.800 --> 1:48:22.600]  Give it every place you can.
[1:48:22.600 --> 1:48:31.040]  Again, the toll free number, 888-799-6111.
[1:48:31.040 --> 1:48:32.040]  Thank you.
[1:48:32.040 --> 1:48:33.480]  And we'll give it out again right before you leave.
[1:48:33.480 --> 1:48:34.480]  All right, let's go to calls.
[1:48:34.480 --> 1:48:35.480]  David in Florida.
[1:48:35.480 --> 1:48:36.480]  David, you're on the air.
[1:48:36.480 --> 1:48:37.480]  Yeah, Alex.
[1:48:37.480 --> 1:48:38.480]  How are you doing?
[1:48:38.480 --> 1:48:39.480]  And how are you doing, Lindsay?
[1:48:39.480 --> 1:48:40.480]  I got a question.
[1:48:40.480 --> 1:48:45.120]  I got a question for you about Obama.
[1:48:45.120 --> 1:48:50.240]  If the elite that you know aren't in control of him, and Alex has done the Obama deception
[1:48:50.240 --> 1:48:54.760]  in the fall of the republic, who is in control of Obama?
[1:48:54.760 --> 1:48:58.480]  And I have one more question I have to answer that.
[1:48:58.480 --> 1:49:00.400]  Obama is totally out of control.
[1:49:00.400 --> 1:49:06.400]  And I was told by this individual just days ago that they've got problems with Obama.
[1:49:06.400 --> 1:49:08.920]  Now, I cannot say what he told me.
[1:49:08.920 --> 1:49:12.160]  And I'm sorry, you'll just have to forgive me.
[1:49:12.160 --> 1:49:16.580]  But there's one equation that he made that I can't use, but I'll tell you this.
[1:49:16.580 --> 1:49:21.600]  If I was Obama, I'd be shaking in my shoes right now because he's so proud, hearty, arrogant.
[1:49:21.600 --> 1:49:27.480]  He bucks them, and he will not get by with too much more before they take some action.
[1:49:27.480 --> 1:49:30.840]  And they are displeased with some of the things that Obama's doing.
[1:49:30.840 --> 1:49:34.920]  Even though he's going along with some of their skull-duggery, yet on the other hand,
[1:49:34.920 --> 1:49:39.920]  this man is in trouble because they wanted McCain, and now Obama is out of control.
[1:49:39.920 --> 1:49:41.400]  Let me just say this.
[1:49:41.400 --> 1:49:42.400]  Let me just say this.
[1:49:42.400 --> 1:49:44.840]  There's two major power blocks in the New World Order.
[1:49:44.840 --> 1:49:47.360]  And they're all intermarried and interwoven.
[1:49:47.360 --> 1:49:50.280]  He got four times the Wall Street money McCain did.
[1:49:50.280 --> 1:49:54.400]  I think that's the certification that they knew he was going to win because of where
[1:49:54.400 --> 1:49:55.400]  he was in the polls.
[1:49:55.400 --> 1:49:59.280]  He's bringing in the carbon tax, the division, he's bringing it all in.
[1:49:59.280 --> 1:50:01.160]  And Lindsey, I'm not poo-pooing your info.
[1:50:01.160 --> 1:50:05.200]  It's turned out to be very accurate in the past, but there are different power blocks.
[1:50:05.200 --> 1:50:07.440]  This guy's almost 90 years old.
[1:50:07.440 --> 1:50:08.440]  He's talking to people.
[1:50:08.440 --> 1:50:13.200]  No doubt there are large parts of the power block that are angry at him.
[1:50:13.200 --> 1:50:17.560]  But I think all the evidence is Obama is establishment.
[1:50:17.560 --> 1:50:23.040]  They could do something to him as part of their false flag to bring in tyranny and race
[1:50:23.040 --> 1:50:26.120]  riots and division.
[1:50:26.120 --> 1:50:31.360]  So and remember in the past, he's changed what he said to you before, and it's very
[1:50:31.360 --> 1:50:37.080]  sophisticated what these guys say, but I'll get your take on that when we come back.
[1:50:37.080 --> 1:50:42.560]  But my point is Obama is being used as the image to sell wider wars, tyranny, all this
[1:50:42.560 --> 1:50:43.800]  stuff.
[1:50:43.800 --> 1:50:50.000]  And so that's why Obama is the lure we use to get people to find out about the New World
[1:50:50.000 --> 1:50:51.000]  Order.
[1:50:51.000 --> 1:50:53.320]  They think they're getting an Obama film and it is somewhat about him, but it's really
[1:50:53.320 --> 1:50:57.360]  about the whole power structure and who the banks are and how to stop them.
[1:50:57.360 --> 1:51:27.320]  That's what the films do, we'll be right back.
[1:51:58.320 --> 1:52:02.320]  and tell them Big Jim Farmer sent you.
[1:52:02.320 --> 1:52:06.480]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[1:52:06.480 --> 1:52:09.640]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[1:52:09.640 --> 1:52:13.960]  As they're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans
[1:52:13.960 --> 1:52:14.960]  at home.
[1:52:14.960 --> 1:52:19.640]  I've turned a tremendous influence on our president in Congress, and they really are
[1:52:19.640 --> 1:52:20.640]  calling the shots.
[1:52:20.640 --> 1:52:25.920]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[1:52:25.920 --> 1:52:29.280]  The fall of the republic identifies the enemies of our nation.
[1:52:29.280 --> 1:52:35.120]  The criminal offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing
[1:52:35.120 --> 1:52:36.120]  world government.
[1:52:36.120 --> 1:52:40.480]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists, they're asking for more matches and the Congress
[1:52:40.480 --> 1:52:42.640]  is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[1:52:42.640 --> 1:52:48.520]  Today seems like nobody does here, and right now in Washington D.C. we have seen a fall
[1:52:48.520 --> 1:52:49.840]  of the republic.

[1:54:21.840 --> 1:54:30.640]  Two more segments left with Lindsey Williams, and we've got another guest coming up.
[1:54:30.640 --> 1:54:33.120]  We'll be back with us Friday, 12 noon.
[1:54:33.120 --> 1:54:38.600]  Lindsey, you heard my points just now before the break.
[1:54:38.600 --> 1:54:41.560]  Obama got four times the Wall Street money of McCain.
[1:54:41.560 --> 1:54:44.560]  They said it, the media said he was like a god, it was going to save us all.
[1:54:44.560 --> 1:54:47.240]  He's been given the Nobel Peace Prize.
[1:54:47.240 --> 1:54:50.760]  I'm not disagreeing with you, and I believe you were told these things, your predictions
[1:54:50.760 --> 1:54:55.680]  that you were given were accurate in the past, it mirrors what we got from inside Bilderberg.
[1:54:55.680 --> 1:54:59.040]  But Obama and McCain, they own both of these guys.
[1:54:59.040 --> 1:55:00.200]  What are you saying?
[1:55:00.200 --> 1:55:02.440]  What are they saying?
[1:55:02.440 --> 1:55:11.520]  John F. Kennedy, I touched this very cautiously, John F. Kennedy was quite a patriotic American.
[1:55:11.520 --> 1:55:15.880]  He did most everything that they wanted back in those days, but John F. Kennedy touched
[1:55:15.880 --> 1:55:21.840]  one sore spot to the Federal Reserve, and was going to tell the whole story when he
[1:55:21.840 --> 1:55:25.600]  got to Texas, and as a result, you know what happened to him.
[1:55:25.600 --> 1:55:30.040]  Now Obama is touching a few spots that they don't like, yes, I agree with you.
[1:55:30.040 --> 1:55:34.720]  He's doing almost everything that they want, both of them were their man, so to speak.
[1:55:34.720 --> 1:55:39.120]  Are they just racist, maybe deep down, and they want to crush him?
[1:55:39.120 --> 1:55:40.120]  No, not necessarily.
[1:55:40.120 --> 1:55:46.600]  These people are not racist at all, quite to the contrary, that, yeah, I won't get
[1:55:46.600 --> 1:55:50.000]  into that subject right now, but no, they're not racist at all.
[1:55:50.000 --> 1:55:53.600]  It's just that he's touching a few points that they don't necessarily like.
[1:55:53.600 --> 1:55:58.080]  He told you this, you're just reporting what he said, let's take another call then.
[1:55:58.080 --> 1:56:02.080]  Let's talk to Eric in Pennsylvania, you're on the air, Eric.
[1:56:02.080 --> 1:56:04.600]  Hey, Lindsay, hey, Alex.
[1:56:04.600 --> 1:56:05.600]  Hi, Eric.
[1:56:05.600 --> 1:56:08.840]  Hey, Lindsay Williams, you're on our website, it's really cool, man.
[1:56:08.840 --> 1:56:11.920]  I checked it out a few months ago, you got a lot of good info on there.
[1:56:11.920 --> 1:56:12.920]  Well, thank you.
[1:56:12.920 --> 1:56:17.960]  You know, they made me close down my official website back two years ago, and I said, you
[1:56:17.960 --> 1:56:20.800]  either do that or we're going to take action against you, but yes.
[1:56:20.800 --> 1:56:22.720]  Eric, do you have any quick questions?
[1:56:22.720 --> 1:56:25.200]  Yeah, absolutely, I do.
[1:56:25.200 --> 1:56:30.840]  I was watching a Jordan Maxwell interview last week, and he was talking about how the Vatican
[1:56:30.840 --> 1:56:33.520]  runs the whole global government thing.
[1:56:33.520 --> 1:56:37.920]  Now with all your meetings with the elites behind the scenes, have you ever heard this
[1:56:37.920 --> 1:56:38.920]  before?
[1:56:38.920 --> 1:56:39.920]  Do you agree with that?
[1:56:39.920 --> 1:56:40.920]  No.
[1:56:40.920 --> 1:56:41.920]  Okay.
[1:56:41.920 --> 1:56:42.920]  Thank you, Eric.
[1:56:42.920 --> 1:56:43.920]  Hold on.
[1:56:43.920 --> 1:56:44.920]  I've not heard that subject at all.
[1:56:44.920 --> 1:56:47.680]  We did not go into that with the gentleman the other day.
[1:56:47.680 --> 1:56:54.200]  He touched on the, uh, Satan's, uh, let's say Satan's Messiah, Odell's Messiah, he
[1:56:54.200 --> 1:56:57.040]  called it, but it didn't deal with that subject at all.
[1:56:57.040 --> 1:56:59.080]  Yeah, I just want to be clear.
[1:56:59.080 --> 1:57:01.640]  The Vatican's called for New World Order.
[1:57:01.640 --> 1:57:03.960]  The Protestant leaders are pushing it.
[1:57:03.960 --> 1:57:08.840]  Pat Robertson saying you can't stand against Obama, he's of the Lord.
[1:57:08.840 --> 1:57:09.840]  People get confused.
[1:57:09.840 --> 1:57:12.800]  All these major nations are controlled by the New World Order, and I would say the city
[1:57:12.800 --> 1:57:16.600]  of, uh, you know, the Vatican is as well.
[1:57:16.600 --> 1:57:21.720]  Um, so absolutely, but, but, but the establishment plays people off against each other with different
[1:57:21.720 --> 1:57:23.320]  pieces of the New World Order.
[1:57:23.320 --> 1:57:28.760]  This is an international financial elite that control the purse strings of the planet.
[1:57:28.760 --> 1:57:30.560]  And that's their main power structure.
[1:57:30.560 --> 1:57:31.560]  Lindsey.
[1:57:31.560 --> 1:57:32.560]  Yes.
[1:57:32.560 --> 1:57:33.920]  The game is control.
[1:57:33.920 --> 1:57:35.240]  It's not paper.
[1:57:35.240 --> 1:57:36.840]  It's gold and silver.
[1:57:36.840 --> 1:57:41.120]  And these people, if I, uh, some of them that I met when I was on transit, last oil pipeline
[1:57:41.120 --> 1:57:44.600]  could write a check for a million dollars every day the rest of their life and ever spend
[1:57:44.600 --> 1:57:45.600]  all their money.
[1:57:45.600 --> 1:57:51.200]  The name of the game is control, control of masses of people, manipulation of nations,
[1:57:51.200 --> 1:57:52.200]  currencies.
[1:57:52.200 --> 1:57:55.400]  Because if you have control, you can just make yourself a hundred trillion bucks and
[1:57:55.400 --> 1:57:56.640]  have the slaves pay for it.
[1:57:56.640 --> 1:57:57.640]  If you want.
[1:57:57.640 --> 1:57:58.640]  Sure.
[1:57:58.640 --> 1:57:59.640]  And you pay for it.
[1:57:59.640 --> 1:58:04.720]  You don't want to have trillion dollars in the last two months of the Bush administration.
[1:58:04.720 --> 1:58:05.880]  They love you.
[1:58:05.880 --> 1:58:07.400]  They're laughing at you.
[1:58:07.400 --> 1:58:10.240]  I mean, this actually was brought out in this conversation.
[1:58:10.240 --> 1:58:12.800]  The elite are laughing at you stupid Americans.
[1:58:12.800 --> 1:58:16.360]  I mean, it's time for you to sit up and take notice.
[1:58:16.360 --> 1:58:18.560]  These people think that you're totally dumb.
[1:58:18.560 --> 1:58:19.560]  You ought.
[1:58:19.560 --> 1:58:20.560]  You've got plenty of sense.
[1:58:20.560 --> 1:58:24.160]  Now get up and do something about it.
[1:58:24.160 --> 1:58:28.960]  We have to get past all the media hype in the sports and the entertainment and the celebrities
[1:58:28.960 --> 1:58:30.480]  and get down to real issues.
[1:58:30.480 --> 1:58:35.800]  An international private banking cartel is engaged in a Ponzi scheme overthrow of the
[1:58:35.800 --> 1:58:36.800]  US.
[1:58:36.800 --> 1:58:42.920]  The Ponzi scheme has been to destroy the United States.
[1:58:42.920 --> 1:58:45.400]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[1:58:50.600 --> 1:58:55.240]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[1:58:55.240 --> 1:58:59.600]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[1:58:59.600 --> 1:59:03.920]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company
[1:59:03.920 --> 1:59:05.240]  allows you to have.
[1:59:05.240 --> 1:59:06.240]  It's true.
[1:59:06.240 --> 1:59:10.940]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[1:59:10.940 --> 1:59:15.280]  Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[1:59:15.280 --> 1:59:19.280]  And now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[1:59:19.280 --> 1:59:22.760]  Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[1:59:22.760 --> 1:59:26.480]  Over a year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related onages.
[1:59:26.480 --> 1:59:31.240]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[1:59:31.240 --> 1:59:35.000]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science,
[1:59:35.000 --> 1:59:36.400]  one of my oldest sponsors.

[2:00:05.360 --> 2:00:10.160]  Big brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[2:00:10.160 --> 2:00:11.160]  You want answers?
[2:00:11.160 --> 2:00:13.400]  Well, so does he.
[2:00:13.400 --> 2:00:17.520]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[2:00:17.520 --> 2:00:22.520]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[2:00:22.520 --> 2:00:26.240]  David Ray Grevins coming up for the rest of the hour, then open phones and a huge news
[2:00:26.240 --> 2:00:29.960]  blitz in the fourth hour today.
[2:00:29.960 --> 2:00:36.440]  We are only 26 hours away from the release of Fall of the Republic at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[2:00:36.440 --> 2:00:41.040]  Lindsey Williams, who I really appreciate as our guest right now, let's talk to who's
[2:00:41.040 --> 2:00:43.840]  up next here, John.
[2:00:43.840 --> 2:00:44.840]  That's who I thought.
[2:00:44.840 --> 2:00:45.840]  Matt, in Ohio.
[2:00:45.840 --> 2:00:46.840]  You're on the air with Lindsey Williams.
[2:00:46.840 --> 2:00:47.840]  Go ahead.
[2:00:47.840 --> 2:00:48.840]  Hello.
[2:00:48.840 --> 2:00:52.680]  I had a quick question here.
[2:00:52.680 --> 2:00:54.400]  I just tuned in, so I apologize.
[2:00:54.400 --> 2:00:58.280]  I wasn't able to listen to part of the show here.
[2:00:58.280 --> 2:01:04.960]  I'm 70 Adventists, and I had done some research about Ellen G. White, a writer from the 1800s.
[2:01:04.960 --> 2:01:13.080]  She also had visions that she made predictions based on, and the question that I have is
[2:01:13.080 --> 2:01:18.240]  based on something that she wrote about, obviously, she said there's going to be a second Great
[2:01:18.240 --> 2:01:23.000]  Depression, and we all know that that's pretty much on the way, but she also talked about
[2:01:23.000 --> 2:01:24.920]  a national Sunday law.
[2:01:24.920 --> 2:01:27.000]  Can you elaborate on that?
[2:01:27.000 --> 2:01:31.120]  Here's the deal, and I appreciate your call.
[2:01:31.120 --> 2:01:36.760]  I'm a Christian, but this is a secular radio show that I have pastors on, and all this
[2:01:36.760 --> 2:01:42.280]  ever turns into a Seventh-day Adventist, Jehovah's Witness, Baptist, Catholic stuff, and all of
[2:01:42.280 --> 2:01:46.040]  them asking who's right and whose vision's right and who's this and that.
[2:01:46.040 --> 2:01:49.880]  The bankers are announcing they're engineering a crisis to bring in a one-world government
[2:01:49.880 --> 2:01:51.040]  and destroy the dollar.
[2:01:51.040 --> 2:01:56.760]  They're deploying 379,000 regular army troops incrementally on the streets of America.
[2:01:56.760 --> 2:02:00.280]  All this stuff's happening, and I can prove it, they're getting ready to put carbon taxes
[2:02:00.280 --> 2:02:08.600]  on flying, on TV sets, on beef, total control, and I have, I've probably been sent that Seventh-day
[2:02:08.600 --> 2:02:12.360]  Adventist book probably 200 times, I mean, they're all over the office.
[2:02:12.360 --> 2:02:17.000]  I've read it years ago, and it talks about a second depression.
[2:02:17.000 --> 2:02:18.720]  I mean, I'm not bashing anybody.
[2:02:18.720 --> 2:02:21.320]  I'm not bashing Mormons, Seventh-day Adventists, any of it.
[2:02:21.320 --> 2:02:23.680]  I'm sure there's a lot of nice people in all those groups.
[2:02:23.680 --> 2:02:28.760]  It's just, I don't gauge my decisions according to all that, and yes, they talk about there
[2:02:28.760 --> 2:02:33.160]  being a law, you've got to have church on Sunday, and stuff like that.
[2:02:33.160 --> 2:02:38.760]  I mean, it's a totally separate subject than what we're talking about with the banks imploding.
[2:02:38.760 --> 2:02:41.040]  I don't see them making you have church on Sunday.
[2:02:41.040 --> 2:02:44.880]  I see the feds taking over the churches, and they can say whatever they want as long as
[2:02:44.880 --> 2:02:49.440]  they worship the government, though they are banning rabbis having meetings at their houses
[2:02:49.440 --> 2:02:53.520]  and Christians having prayer meetings at their houses, so maybe that is going to happen.
[2:02:53.520 --> 2:02:55.000]  I don't know.
[2:02:55.000 --> 2:02:59.560]  Lindsay Williams, we've got sidetracked, we've got two minutes left, but your comments on
[2:02:59.560 --> 2:03:00.560]  that?
[2:03:00.560 --> 2:03:03.640]  Yes, I really don't have any comments on that because that is not what this gentleman
[2:03:03.640 --> 2:03:04.840]  and I talked about.
[2:03:04.840 --> 2:03:09.240]  We talked about the secular part of it, and I've given you that, and on Friday I will
[2:03:09.240 --> 2:03:13.600]  talk about everything he had to say about money, what's going to happen, the timeline,
[2:03:13.600 --> 2:03:16.240]  a chronological breakdown, and so on.
[2:03:16.240 --> 2:03:19.480]  We stayed with that because that's his expertise.
[2:03:19.480 --> 2:03:24.640]  But what do you think of the fact that the establishment uses divide and conquer?
[2:03:24.640 --> 2:03:26.960]  And so there's just all these hundreds of groups.
[2:03:26.960 --> 2:03:32.280]  Each group has all the answers they're told, and then everybody just debates, and no matter
[2:03:32.280 --> 2:03:35.400]  how many guests I have on about the Vatican being corrupt and being a big part of the
[2:03:35.400 --> 2:03:39.280]  New World Order, I always get emails and calls going, you never talk about the Vatican.
[2:03:39.280 --> 2:03:43.200]  Well, you know, do you work for them when I'm a Protestant and my family, you know,
[2:03:43.200 --> 2:03:47.720]  the Heir's family and others help found Texas in a Protestant revolution?
[2:03:47.720 --> 2:03:53.720]  And then I know that they came out that Israel put out a propaganda hit on me knowing they
[2:03:53.720 --> 2:03:59.400]  can play people off against each other with this fable that I work for the Vatican or
[2:03:59.400 --> 2:04:00.400]  something.
[2:04:00.400 --> 2:04:01.400]  It's just pointless.
[2:04:01.400 --> 2:04:06.120]  They're trying to forcibly inoculate people, world governments coming down on us, all the
[2:04:06.120 --> 2:04:10.280]  big governments, all the big religions are New World Order controlled now.
[2:04:10.280 --> 2:04:12.680]  That doesn't mean you're New World Order controlled.
[2:04:12.680 --> 2:04:16.560]  You can stand up against the global government, and the big government they use to force
[2:04:16.560 --> 2:04:18.280]  all of this on us.
[2:04:18.280 --> 2:04:22.840]  Pastor Williams, thank you so much for spending time with us today.
[2:04:22.840 --> 2:04:28.280]  We'll go over the last part of the timeline and the chronological order, high noon, Friday.
[2:04:28.280 --> 2:04:30.800]  I really appreciate you spending time with us.
[2:04:30.800 --> 2:04:32.200]  We've got 30 seconds.
[2:04:32.200 --> 2:04:35.040]  Fire out that number for folks to get the new DVD.
[2:04:35.040 --> 2:04:40.680]  Seven hours of DVD viewing, professionally done before numerous cameras.
[2:04:40.680 --> 2:04:45.440]  You've never seen anything like it, the number toll-free number, I beg of you, copy these
[2:04:45.440 --> 2:04:46.640]  DVDs.
[2:04:46.640 --> 2:04:54.120]  The toll-free number is 888-799-6111.
[2:04:54.120 --> 2:04:55.120]  We're out of time.
[2:04:55.120 --> 2:04:56.120]  We're out of time.
[2:04:56.120 --> 2:04:58.120]  Lindsay, I'll see you Friday at noon, okay?
[2:04:58.120 --> 2:04:59.120]  Thank you.
[2:04:59.120 --> 2:05:00.120]  God bless you.
[2:05:00.120 --> 2:05:01.120]  We'll be right back.
[2:05:01.120 --> 2:05:27.960]  We'll be right back.
[2:05:27.960 --> 2:05:55.880]  We'll be right back.
[2:05:57.960 --> 2:06:25.400]  We'll be right back.
[2:06:25.400 --> 2:06:51.800]  We'll be right back.
[2:06:51.800 --> 2:07:18.200]  We'll be right back.
[2:07:18.200 --> 2:07:44.600]  We'll be right back.
[2:07:44.600 --> 2:08:12.120]  We'll be right back.
[2:08:14.600 --> 2:08:22.240]  And just a moment, we're going to be talking to David Ray Griffin, best-selling author,
[2:08:22.240 --> 2:08:27.960]  35 books on philosophy, Religion, Politics, he's had a lot of great books, but New Pearl
[2:08:27.960 --> 2:08:32.400]  Harbor revisited, was a publisher's week, pick of the week, and we're going to get his
[2:08:32.400 --> 2:08:37.440]  response on all the new big 9-11 developments and does he think that the establishment's
[2:08:37.440 --> 2:08:41.080]  going to have to stage some new terror to get control?
[2:08:41.080 --> 2:08:46.000]  Jundala, it's admitted over in Iran, is an al-Qaeda offshoot, formally commanded by
[2:08:46.000 --> 2:08:50.200]  the number three in al-Qaeda, Bush admitted they were funding them to stage terror attacks
[2:08:50.200 --> 2:08:51.200]  inside Iran.
[2:08:51.200 --> 2:08:56.560]  They just blew up a military-based headquarters, killed a bunch of top generals and people,
[2:08:56.560 --> 2:09:01.760]  Iran's swearing revenge, and the White House is continuing the operations of Bush, so we'll
[2:09:01.760 --> 2:09:05.480]  talk about government-sponsored terror with David Ray Griffin, and all the attempted debunking
[2:09:05.480 --> 2:09:14.120]  that's been going on, the piece they had a month or so ago on one of the big TV channels,
[2:09:14.120 --> 2:09:19.680]  National Geographic, I've had Professor Stephen Jones on, I've had some of the other participants
[2:09:19.680 --> 2:09:24.440]  from the TV show on, like the founder of Architects and Engineers for 9-11 Truth, Richard Gage,
[2:09:24.440 --> 2:09:30.840]  he says they lied to him, swore it would be fair, swore they'd premiere and present their
[2:09:30.840 --> 2:09:37.200]  information, showed them a fake final cut that was nothing like what they actually saw.
[2:09:37.200 --> 2:09:43.560]  So we'll talk about that too with David Ray Griffin coming up here today.
[2:09:43.560 --> 2:09:54.920]  Just briefly, we are 25 hours and 15 minutes exactly, 25 hours and 15 minutes exactly on
[2:09:54.920 --> 2:09:56.680]  my mark.
[2:09:56.680 --> 2:10:06.360]  The atomic clock says 109, 57, 58, 59, on my mark right now, we are 25 hours, 15 minutes
[2:10:06.360 --> 2:10:08.400]  from the release of Fall of the Republic.
[2:10:08.400 --> 2:10:14.760]  We detail how Obama is controlled by the very interests of Wall Street.
[2:10:14.760 --> 2:10:19.160]  We detail how he's being built up to be actually destroyed by these people, to be blamed for
[2:10:19.160 --> 2:10:21.420]  their entire agenda.
[2:10:21.420 --> 2:10:25.120]  We detail it all in Fall of the Republic, that's why I'm being demonized for the Obama
[2:10:25.120 --> 2:10:30.720]  deception right now by national media, because this, when you watch this film, it's an indictment
[2:10:30.720 --> 2:10:35.760]  of the entire corrupt military industrial complex, you can get the DVD right now at
[2:10:35.760 --> 2:10:40.760]  infowars.com, they're now shipping out today, they're shipping them in mass right now and
[2:10:40.760 --> 2:10:45.400]  it premieres at prismplanet.tv at 3pm central tomorrow when the show ends.
[2:10:45.400 --> 2:10:49.160]  Two other sponsors I want to tell you about for the balance of the hour, David Ray Griffin
[2:10:49.160 --> 2:10:50.320]  is our guest.
[2:10:50.320 --> 2:10:55.080]  One of the sponsors I want to tell you about is Front Sight Firearms Training, it's family
[2:10:55.080 --> 2:11:01.120]  fun, the premier firearm training institute in the country, no drill instructor, no tough
[2:11:01.120 --> 2:11:05.920]  guy attitude, how to properly use a handgun, a rifle, a shotgun, they have two day courses,
[2:11:05.920 --> 2:11:11.560]  four day courses, five day courses, they also have a lot of free online stuff at FrontSight.com,
[2:11:11.560 --> 2:11:19.840]  F-R-O-N-T-S-I-G-H-T.com, and they've got a deal where you get a 30 plus state concealed
[2:11:19.840 --> 2:11:25.480]  weapons permit, a free Springfield Armory XT pistol in the caliber of your choice when
[2:11:25.480 --> 2:11:30.960]  you sign up for the five day firearms training course that is extremely inexpensive.
[2:11:30.960 --> 2:11:35.160]  Long before I even knew what Front Sight was like 10 years ago, eight, nine years ago, everybody
[2:11:35.160 --> 2:11:38.760]  I knew, police, military, locals all went there.
[2:11:38.760 --> 2:11:42.960]  This is above military and law enforcement level training, a lot of Marines and people
[2:11:42.960 --> 2:11:47.560]  go into theater, go there to get tuned up on their snipering.
[2:11:47.560 --> 2:11:52.880]  FrontSight.com, ladies and gentlemen, FrontSight.com, check out the free deal or get on their free
[2:11:52.880 --> 2:11:53.880]  mailing list.
[2:11:53.880 --> 2:11:55.880]  They're at FrontSight.com.
[2:11:55.880 --> 2:12:01.480]  Okay, let's go ahead now and go to David Ray Griffin.
[2:12:01.480 --> 2:12:06.200]  He has a long bio, but he's kind of one of the omnibudsman or the omnibudsman of the
[2:12:06.200 --> 2:12:08.520]  9-11 Truth Movement.
[2:12:08.520 --> 2:12:12.720]  He just devastates the disinformation that the debunkers keep putting out, the lies, the
[2:12:12.720 --> 2:12:18.400]  distortions, how they keep changing their story, and there's so much to talk about.
[2:12:18.400 --> 2:12:22.120]  We've got this former prime minister coming out and saying he got a warning 10 minutes
[2:12:22.120 --> 2:12:23.120]  before.
[2:12:23.120 --> 2:12:26.760]  Danish prime minister, you know, that the towers were going to fall.
[2:12:26.760 --> 2:12:28.360]  That ties into Giuliani.
[2:12:28.360 --> 2:12:30.560]  We've got the debunking going on.
[2:12:30.560 --> 2:12:34.360]  We've got so many things that are happening, but David Ray Griffin, first off, great to
[2:12:34.360 --> 2:12:35.360]  have you here.
[2:12:35.360 --> 2:12:40.280]  And what do you think is most important today that you would like to cover first?
[2:12:40.280 --> 2:12:48.880]  Well, of course, I have my new book on World Trade Center 7, and in my mind and in that
[2:12:48.880 --> 2:12:58.680]  of many other people who've read it, it provides the most convincing evidence yet that the
[2:12:58.680 --> 2:13:07.840]  official story about the World Trade Center is false, and not simply false, but that they
[2:13:07.840 --> 2:13:16.240]  have just told lie upon lie, and in my book, I deal with the question of scientific fraud,
[2:13:16.240 --> 2:13:22.360]  which is a technical term put out by the National Science Foundation and others that involves
[2:13:22.360 --> 2:13:28.760]  omission of data, falsification of data, and fabrication of data, and they do all of these,
[2:13:28.760 --> 2:13:33.080]  and they do them very blatantly and obviously.
[2:13:33.080 --> 2:13:38.080]  So the NIST report, all of it, is basically like Piltdown Man, really the jaw of a pig,
[2:13:38.080 --> 2:13:39.560]  not the missing link.
[2:13:39.560 --> 2:13:45.920]  Yeah, I mean, they even contradict what they had put out in previous reports before they
[2:13:45.920 --> 2:13:50.560]  came up with their new theory, and so you can see they're lying.
[2:13:50.560 --> 2:13:56.080]  And for a lot of people whose eyes glaze over when you talk about steel temperatures and
[2:13:56.080 --> 2:14:02.480]  what fire can do to steel and what you need for a straight down symmetrical collapse, when
[2:14:02.480 --> 2:14:10.200]  they see that people are just lying, for many people, that's the most convincing thing.
[2:14:10.200 --> 2:14:14.440]  I want to go over that, but first let's get into some other issues, because this is key,
[2:14:14.440 --> 2:14:20.680]  the book is key, the consortium, the consolidation of the really vetted hardcore data that you've
[2:14:20.680 --> 2:14:25.280]  put together in this book, and we, again, respect who's one of the foremost bona fide
[2:14:25.280 --> 2:14:27.720]  researchers, David Ray Griffin.
[2:14:27.720 --> 2:14:33.200]  You were, though, in the National Geographic hit piece, give us your take on how that was
[2:14:33.200 --> 2:14:36.280]  shot, guarantees that were made.
[2:14:36.280 --> 2:14:43.600]  You agree with Jones, Professor Jones, and architect and engineer, others who were speaking
[2:14:43.600 --> 2:14:44.600]  out.
[2:14:44.600 --> 2:14:45.600]  Richard Gage.
[2:14:45.600 --> 2:14:47.560]  Yeah, Richard Gage.
[2:14:47.560 --> 2:14:50.800]  And what do you think of them shooting a missile into a chicken coop and saying, that's the
[2:14:50.800 --> 2:14:51.800]  Pentagon?
[2:14:51.800 --> 2:14:55.800]  I mean, it was almost like this was made to be a joke, but go ahead.
[2:14:55.800 --> 2:15:02.360]  Well, yes, I agree with what Richard said, that they were very deceptive in the way they
[2:15:02.360 --> 2:15:09.880]  approached us, and we've done this enough, we know to be cautious and to take these things
[2:15:09.880 --> 2:15:19.960]  with a grain of salt, but still the level of duplicity here was really extreme.
[2:15:19.960 --> 2:15:27.040]  And then, as you say, these experiments they formed, and part of the duplicity was that
[2:15:27.040 --> 2:15:33.400]  they scheduled this interview with us where we were watching what was supposedly the virtually
[2:15:33.400 --> 2:15:43.080]  final cut while they were filming us, and they didn't tell us ahead of time that the
[2:15:43.080 --> 2:15:49.080]  crux of their argument against us was going to be these scientific experiments, and they
[2:15:49.080 --> 2:15:52.720]  scheduled at a time that Stephen Jones could not be there.
[2:15:52.720 --> 2:15:57.840]  Now, in fairness to them, they did hope that originally hope he was going to be there,
[2:15:57.840 --> 2:16:03.640]  but he suggested they bring in Kevin Ryan instead, and even though they first contacted
[2:16:03.640 --> 2:16:07.000]  Kevin and he was willing to come, they did not bring him.
[2:16:07.000 --> 2:16:10.400]  So we didn't have a single scientist sitting around there.
[2:16:10.400 --> 2:16:14.280]  Let's put this in layman's terms, though, okay, because I know you're being technical.
[2:16:14.280 --> 2:16:17.320]  They said, we want to show you basically the final cut.
[2:16:17.320 --> 2:16:20.760]  They get you in a room, you're there to see it, and they go, what do you think of this
[2:16:20.760 --> 2:16:21.760]  experiment?
[2:16:21.760 --> 2:16:24.000]  We're going to shoot a missile into a plywood box.
[2:16:24.000 --> 2:16:31.200]  Yeah, and all three experiments, you know, for National Geographic, which really has
[2:16:31.200 --> 2:16:38.200]  earned a good reputation over the years with its quality magazine, they should be just
[2:16:38.200 --> 2:16:45.960]  horribly embarrassed by this, because what they presented as scientific experiments
[2:16:45.960 --> 2:16:49.560]  were just totally laughable.
[2:16:49.560 --> 2:16:55.080]  The other one that is even more outrageous was the thermite experiment.
[2:16:55.080 --> 2:17:00.000]  First of all, we had all stressed, Stephen Jones had particularly stressed the difference
[2:17:00.000 --> 2:17:08.440]  between ordinary thermite, which is an incendiary, and nanothermite, which is a high explosive.
[2:17:08.440 --> 2:17:15.240]  And the argument has been that it was basically nanothermite with maybe some help from ordinary
[2:17:15.240 --> 2:17:20.840]  thermite and thermate, which has sulfur at it, or used to bring the building down.
[2:17:20.840 --> 2:17:27.760]  Well, the guy said, well, you know, I couldn't get any nanothermite, you know, an ordinary
[2:17:27.760 --> 2:17:30.960]  person can't get that, so we had to use what we had.
[2:17:30.960 --> 2:17:37.680]  So what he did is took a bag of ordinary thermite, put it up next to a steel column, didn't
[2:17:37.680 --> 2:17:39.480]  even make it into a shaped charge.
[2:17:39.480 --> 2:17:43.960]  Now, you know, if you take thermite and turn it into a shaped charge, it will cause some
[2:17:43.960 --> 2:17:50.240]  real damage to a piece of steel, but not just a bag of thermite that you set on fire.
[2:17:50.240 --> 2:17:54.920]  And then he said, there, there's proof that nanothermite could have not brought down the
[2:17:54.920 --> 2:17:55.920]  World Trade Center.
[2:17:55.920 --> 2:17:58.280]  But David Ray Griffin, it's worse than that.
[2:17:58.280 --> 2:18:03.600]  I have seen Dr. Jones and others' thermite experiments with a cup of it on an engine
[2:18:03.600 --> 2:18:06.440]  block, regular thermite burns right through.
[2:18:06.440 --> 2:18:11.360]  This stuff didn't even sparkle like sparklers, it really looked staged, and then they say
[2:18:11.360 --> 2:18:16.720]  on the show, they couldn't even prove there's such a thing as explosive thermite, despite
[2:18:16.720 --> 2:18:22.440]  the fact there are scores of patents, NASA uses it on rocket decouplers, a bunch of NIST
[2:18:22.440 --> 2:18:28.920]  scientists are top explosive thermite, thermate experts to just deny that there's even such
[2:18:28.920 --> 2:18:31.800]  a thing when it's at least 30 years old.
[2:18:31.800 --> 2:18:35.040]  I mean, I couldn't believe how ridiculous the show was.
[2:18:35.040 --> 2:18:40.080]  Yeah, and here they were, they were coming up on the anniversary of 9-11, and I think
[2:18:40.080 --> 2:18:45.960]  they, they took the people who had become most visible, myself and Dylan Avery and Richard
[2:18:45.960 --> 2:18:55.280]  Gage and Stephen Jones, and the attempt was to discredit us with this, and what they ended
[2:18:55.280 --> 2:19:02.240]  up doing was simply discrediting themselves and discrediting National Geographic, because
[2:19:02.240 --> 2:19:11.000]  even ordinary citizens who have no understanding of scientific method and, and, and, and so
[2:19:11.000 --> 2:19:15.600]  on, they could see these were obviously ridiculous experiments.
[2:19:15.600 --> 2:19:21.080]  And by the way, you're not just putting a good face on this, I was horrified by it,
[2:19:21.080 --> 2:19:26.040]  but then within days, everyone I talked to, even skeptics said that was ridiculous, it
[2:19:26.040 --> 2:19:28.040]  really did blow up in their face.
[2:19:28.040 --> 2:19:33.880]  Yeah, yeah, so it didn't do the 9-11 truth movement any harm, I would say, all in all
[2:19:33.880 --> 2:19:40.520]  it did good because it, it, it showed how desperate the defenders are that they would
[2:19:40.520 --> 2:19:43.600]  go to such ridiculous lengths to try to discredit us.
[2:19:43.600 --> 2:19:49.240]  All right, we're going to come back, talk about your book and Building 7, the key data,
[2:19:49.240 --> 2:19:56.200]  then we're going to get into not just the physical evidence, but all the people that
[2:19:56.200 --> 2:20:00.960]  got warnings to get out of the towers while the, stay there.
[2:20:26.600 --> 2:20:28.080]  the results as well.
[2:20:28.080 --> 2:20:50.760]  Here's what Dr. Goodman has to say about his experience with the product.
[2:20:50.760 --> 2:20:58.560]  Feel to order your two months supply of heart and body extract today, call 1-866-295-5305

[2:21:01.200 --> 2:21:03.320]  Why are you letting that search engine spy on you?
[2:21:03.320 --> 2:21:04.320]  Spy on me?
[2:21:04.320 --> 2:21:08.000]  Yeah, don't you know Google, Yahoo and other search engines record all your searches and
[2:21:08.000 --> 2:21:09.560]  store them in a giant database?
[2:21:09.560 --> 2:21:11.400]  You should use start page instead.
[2:21:11.400 --> 2:21:12.400]  Start page?
[2:21:12.400 --> 2:21:13.400]  Yeah, startpage.com.
[2:21:13.400 --> 2:21:16.400]  The new name for Xquik, the world's most private search engine.
[2:21:16.400 --> 2:21:20.280]  They don't record your searches or your IP address, and the search results are great.
[2:21:20.280 --> 2:21:23.240]  Plus, start page is third party certified, and it's totally free.
[2:21:23.240 --> 2:21:26.720]  I don't want big brother watching what I do on the internet, I'm adding start page
[2:21:26.720 --> 2:21:27.720]  to my browser.

[2:22:01.720 --> 2:22:03.720]  Mike Stenerson from ITUS Resources.
[2:22:03.720 --> 2:22:06.640]  At no time in history have precious metals been more important.
[2:22:06.640 --> 2:22:09.240]  Certainly not my 17 years in the industry.
[2:22:09.240 --> 2:22:11.600]  Nearly 100 banks have been shuttered this year.
[2:22:11.600 --> 2:22:14.800]  As many as 200 more banks are suspect by year's end.
[2:22:14.800 --> 2:22:17.240]  The FDIC is operating in the red.
[2:22:17.240 --> 2:22:18.240]  Who pays for that?
[2:22:18.240 --> 2:22:19.520]  Is your money safe?
[2:22:19.520 --> 2:22:23.600]  The dollar has lost over 95% of its value in the last 60 years.
[2:22:23.600 --> 2:22:27.040]  No fiat currency has ever survived the government printing presses.
[2:22:27.040 --> 2:22:28.200]  Ours is not immune.
[2:22:28.200 --> 2:22:30.640]  The time is now to be proactive.
[2:22:30.640 --> 2:22:32.720]  Anything tied to the dollar is at risk.
[2:22:32.720 --> 2:22:37.680]  CDs, annuities, 401Ks, IRAs, stocks, bonds, you name it.
[2:22:37.680 --> 2:22:41.480]  So decide do you want to leave a legacy of wealth or debt for your family?
[2:22:41.480 --> 2:22:42.800]  The choice is yours.
[2:22:42.800 --> 2:22:48.120]  Call me at 1-800-686-2237 extension 116.
[2:22:48.120 --> 2:22:52.320]  Call 1-800-686-2237 extension 116.
[2:22:52.320 --> 2:22:55.120]  Be proactive, not reactive.
[2:22:55.120 --> 2:23:01.000]  Call 1-800-686-2237 extension 116.
[2:23:01.000 --> 2:23:05.000]  The following message is proudly and patriotically brought to you by the owners of Ready Reserve
[2:23:05.000 --> 2:23:06.000]  Foods, Inc.
[2:23:06.000 --> 2:23:10.120]  It is generally not the place for a business or corporation to make an editorial stand,
[2:23:10.120 --> 2:23:11.560]  but times have changed.
[2:23:11.560 --> 2:23:15.480]  It has become very obvious that our government is completely out of control and has decoupled
[2:23:15.480 --> 2:23:18.120]  from any constraints placed on it by the Constitution.
[2:23:18.120 --> 2:23:22.080]  It is also obvious that they are racing at breakneck speeds to place our once sovereign
[2:23:22.080 --> 2:23:25.440]  nation under the control of a global socialist government.
[2:23:25.440 --> 2:23:29.200]  These treasonous leaders, and we use the term treasonous because their actions and behavior
[2:23:29.200 --> 2:23:33.880]  can easily be regarded as treason, have over time systematically destroyed our culture,
[2:23:33.880 --> 2:23:36.800]  our industries, and now the US dollar.
[2:23:36.800 --> 2:23:41.360]  This is our country, and they, the leaders, have sold us to the globalists.
[2:23:41.360 --> 2:23:46.200]  The future for America and Americans operating as a sovereign and free people is all but
[2:23:46.200 --> 2:23:47.200]  over.
[2:23:47.200 --> 2:23:48.200]  Get prepared now.
[2:23:48.200 --> 2:23:57.480]  Call Ready Reserve Foods at 1-800-453-2202, 1-800-453-2202, that's 1-800-453-2202 or
[2:23:57.480 --> 2:24:05.200]  www.readyreservefoods.com.
[2:24:05.200 --> 2:24:09.320]  Coming up in 35 minutes when we start the final hour I got a huge news blitz on the global
[2:24:09.320 --> 2:24:15.440]  carbon tax, on the unfolding police state, a huge stack of viral news and your phone
[2:24:15.440 --> 2:24:17.240]  calls are going to be covering.
[2:24:17.240 --> 2:24:26.400]  And I think I'm going to play some clips today from fall of the republic ahead of it airing
[2:24:26.400 --> 2:24:27.400]  to Mars.
[2:24:27.400 --> 2:24:28.400]  Some exclusive clips coming up.
[2:24:28.400 --> 2:24:32.880]  I've also interviewed Jesse Ventura again when I was out in Los Angeles last week filming
[2:24:32.880 --> 2:24:39.240]  some final episodes of his upcoming TV show on TruTV, and I've got an 11 minute interview
[2:24:39.240 --> 2:24:48.000]  I did with him on the set, and we're going to be posting that up on the website later
[2:24:48.000 --> 2:24:49.000]  today.
[2:24:49.000 --> 2:24:50.000]  All right.
[2:24:50.000 --> 2:24:51.000]  Going back to David Ray Greffin.
[2:24:51.000 --> 2:24:53.600]  David, hell, I may just play some of that on air next hour.
[2:24:53.600 --> 2:24:57.240]  David, this is a short segment, long segment coming up.
[2:24:57.240 --> 2:24:59.520]  Obviously, why is 9-11 important?
[2:24:59.520 --> 2:25:00.720]  It was eight years ago.
[2:25:00.720 --> 2:25:06.120]  Well, because this is a false flag event meant to launch this global empire and to take our
[2:25:06.120 --> 2:25:07.600]  liberties here at home.
[2:25:07.600 --> 2:25:11.600]  I mean, all the good old boys and conservatives that loved the war, I kept telling them this
[2:25:11.600 --> 2:25:13.760]  homeland security is for you.
[2:25:13.760 --> 2:25:19.160]  And they list leftist, political activist of all stripes, conservatives, libertarians,
[2:25:19.160 --> 2:25:22.680]  in these DHS reports, proving everything you and others talked about.
[2:25:22.680 --> 2:25:28.000]  So why is 9-11 important today and then get into your Building 7 book?
[2:25:28.000 --> 2:25:31.040]  Well, there's so many reasons it's important.
[2:25:31.040 --> 2:25:40.840]  One of those is that many people are now talking about Afghanistan being the new Vietnam.
[2:25:40.840 --> 2:25:46.720]  And just like Vietnam, Afghanistan, the war is based on a huge lie.
[2:25:46.720 --> 2:25:53.440]  Everybody admits now that Vietnam was based on lies, a couple lies, Tonkin Gulf being
[2:25:53.440 --> 2:25:55.360]  one.
[2:25:55.360 --> 2:26:01.520]  But people haven't recognized yet in general that the war in Afghanistan is also based
[2:26:01.520 --> 2:26:03.600]  on a lie.
[2:26:03.600 --> 2:26:11.080]  And Building 7 coming down in absolute free fall for over two seconds, that by itself
[2:26:11.080 --> 2:26:18.600]  gives the lie to the official story that Muslim terrorists brought down these three buildings
[2:26:18.600 --> 2:26:24.080]  by crashing planes into two of them.
[2:26:24.080 --> 2:26:28.200]  And you know, this administration as well as the previous one, and this one even more
[2:26:28.200 --> 2:26:34.920]  than the previous one, is justifying the war in Afghanistan on the basis of 9-11, saying
[2:26:34.920 --> 2:26:40.680]  over and over, we've got to stop those people, Osama bin Laden and Al Qaeda, the ones who
[2:26:40.680 --> 2:26:43.640]  attacked us on 9-11.
[2:26:43.640 --> 2:26:53.480]  And that's the big lie that now Americans and millions of Afghans are being killed for.
[2:26:53.480 --> 2:26:57.440]  Start getting into your book, start getting into your book for us.
[2:26:57.440 --> 2:27:04.680]  Okay, well, the first part of the book deals with one kind of scientific fraud.
[2:27:04.680 --> 2:27:08.200]  That is the omission of evidence.
[2:27:08.200 --> 2:27:15.760]  And here we have the things that you've talked a lot about on your shows, the omission of
[2:27:15.760 --> 2:27:27.560]  the steel in the rubble that had obviously been melted and even sulfidized to take the
[2:27:27.560 --> 2:27:29.520]  piece of steel in particular.
[2:27:29.520 --> 2:27:35.760]  There was a piece of steel identified in the appendix to the FEMA report that they said
[2:27:35.760 --> 2:27:38.240]  looked like a piece of Swiss cheese.
[2:27:38.240 --> 2:27:39.720]  It had holes in it.
[2:27:39.720 --> 2:27:46.200]  There was an inch thick piece of cheese, a piece of steel, that holes had been burned
[2:27:46.200 --> 2:27:47.200]  into.
[2:27:47.200 --> 2:27:52.160]  Fire can, of course, not even come close to doing any such thing, and yet it happened.
[2:27:52.160 --> 2:27:58.280]  It was reported in the appendix to the FEMA report with the stipulation, this demands
[2:27:58.280 --> 2:28:00.640]  further study.
[2:28:00.640 --> 2:28:06.440]  When this took over the job, it said we will deal with all the recommendations in the FEMA
[2:28:06.440 --> 2:28:07.440]  report.
[2:28:07.440 --> 2:28:08.440]  They did not.
[2:28:08.440 --> 2:28:10.160]  They simply ignored this one.
[2:28:10.160 --> 2:28:17.560]  They even lied and said no steel was recovered from Building 7.
[2:28:17.560 --> 2:28:23.080]  I mean, just incredible lies, and again, even if you believe the official story, why have
[2:28:23.080 --> 2:28:29.040]  they changed their story so many times, different permutations of lies, and then now the bald
[2:28:29.040 --> 2:28:33.680]  face lie, and then we have all the firemen and police saying on video live on CNN and
[2:28:33.680 --> 2:28:34.680]  everywhere, get back.
[2:28:34.680 --> 2:28:36.200]  They're going to bring down 7.
[2:28:36.200 --> 2:28:40.520]  They're blowing it up, and then newscasts reporting it had already fallen exactly the
[2:28:40.520 --> 2:28:41.520]  way it did fall.
[2:28:41.520 --> 2:28:45.320]  I mean, I guess we've just got to come to grips with that it's an inside job and that
[2:28:45.320 --> 2:28:48.720]  people aren't, some of them, aren't ready to face that fear.
[2:28:48.720 --> 2:28:51.800]  Yeah, these were further things they omitted.
[2:28:51.800 --> 2:28:57.800]  They omitted all the testimonies about explosions going off in the building.
[2:28:57.800 --> 2:29:03.640]  Both those explosions that were reported just as the building was about to come down, and
[2:29:03.640 --> 2:29:09.880]  both those explosions reported by Barry Jennings and Michael Hess quite early in the morning.
[2:29:09.880 --> 2:29:16.400]  In fact, the longest section of my book deals with the testimony of Barry Jennings and Michael
[2:29:16.400 --> 2:29:21.560]  Hess and the treatment of it by NIST and by the BBC.
[2:29:21.560 --> 2:29:27.720]  That's quite a long story, which as you know ends up with Barry Jennings dying evidently
[2:29:27.720 --> 2:29:34.920]  two days before the NIST report is issued, which says there was no evidence of explosions
[2:29:34.920 --> 2:29:35.920]  in the building.
[2:29:35.920 --> 2:29:39.160]  David Ray Griffin, when we come back, we'll tell folks the title of your new book, How
[2:29:39.160 --> 2:29:41.960]  to Get It, and you'll continue going through all these lies.
[2:29:41.960 --> 2:29:45.160]  Long segment coming up, plenty of time for you to break all this down.
[2:29:45.160 --> 2:29:47.120]  David Ray Griffin is our guest.
[2:29:47.120 --> 2:29:51.760]  I'm Alex Jones.
[2:29:51.760 --> 2:29:53.040]  We're on the march.
[2:29:53.040 --> 2:29:55.480]  The Empire's on the run.
[2:29:55.480 --> 2:30:00.640]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[2:30:00.640 --> 2:30:04.760]  This is Alex Jones, and I want to tell you all about a cola blue, the state-of-the-art
[2:30:04.760 --> 2:30:09.360]  atmospheric water generators that produces purified drinking water right from the humidity
[2:30:09.360 --> 2:30:10.560]  in the air you breathe.
[2:30:10.560 --> 2:30:12.360]  No, this isn't science fiction.
[2:30:12.360 --> 2:30:13.360]  It's very real.
[2:30:13.360 --> 2:30:14.360]  I know.
[2:30:14.360 --> 2:30:18.200]  I use one every day in my own home, and it's available right now to you.
[2:30:18.200 --> 2:30:21.280]  Clean, great tasting water without all the pollutants.
[2:30:21.280 --> 2:30:25.480]  Make the decision today to claim your own water independence by ordering your own a
[2:30:25.480 --> 2:30:29.920]  cola blue atmospheric water generator for your home or business, just like I did.

[2:31:00.640 --> 2:31:05.280]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want
[2:31:05.280 --> 2:31:06.280]  you to eat.
[2:31:06.280 --> 2:31:09.800]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you
[2:31:09.800 --> 2:31:10.800]  sick?
[2:31:10.800 --> 2:31:12.760]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[2:31:12.760 --> 2:31:14.400]  You don't have to cooperate.
[2:31:14.400 --> 2:31:15.720]  There is a solution.
[2:31:15.720 --> 2:31:19.960]  Your health botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products
[2:31:19.960 --> 2:31:24.160]  for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.

[2:32:00.640 --> 2:32:03.960]  Have you ever wanted to generate your own supply of electrical power?
[2:32:03.960 --> 2:32:07.840]  If so, this is going to be the most important message you will ever hear.
[2:32:07.840 --> 2:32:12.280]  Solar power generators are now available from Solutions from Science in Thompson, Illinois.
[2:32:12.280 --> 2:32:16.720]  These emergency backup systems provide life-saving electrical power when you need it most.
[2:32:16.720 --> 2:32:21.920]  Unlike gas generators, a solar generator runs quietly, emits no fumes, and produces electricity
[2:32:21.920 --> 2:32:22.920]  for free.
[2:32:22.920 --> 2:32:26.560]  It's like having an electric power plant running quietly in your own home.
[2:32:26.560 --> 2:32:31.280]  Run some bumps, shortwave radios, computers, and even keep food from spoiling.
[2:32:31.280 --> 2:32:35.760]  Whether it's hurricanes, ice storms, brownouts, or blackouts, you'll never have to suffer
[2:32:35.760 --> 2:32:37.880]  through painful power outages again.
[2:32:37.880 --> 2:32:40.320]  When the power goes out, you'll be ready.
[2:32:40.320 --> 2:32:46.200]  For the solar power generator from Solutions from Science, go to mysolarbackup.com and
[2:32:46.200 --> 2:32:48.080]  get off the grid today.

[2:32:58.760 --> 2:33:21.480]  Don't wait, call today.
[2:33:21.480 --> 2:33:31.840]  We are 25 hours and 27 minutes away from the launch of Fall of the Republic premiering
[2:33:31.840 --> 2:33:35.400]  tomorrow at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[2:33:35.400 --> 2:33:38.760]  I'll definitely place some clips of the film tomorrow in the run-up to its premiere.
[2:33:38.760 --> 2:33:42.200]  I'm going to maybe play some next hour.
[2:33:42.200 --> 2:33:45.960]  It's just sometimes with our DVD playback system in here, it shudders a little bit and
[2:33:45.960 --> 2:33:46.960]  doesn't do it justice.
[2:33:46.960 --> 2:33:48.560]  I don't know if I want to premiere it that way.
[2:33:48.560 --> 2:33:51.640]  I may just put some sneak peeks up on PrisonPlanet.tv.
[2:33:51.640 --> 2:33:58.000]  We may place this never-before-seen Ventura interview where he talks about the new 9-11
[2:33:58.000 --> 2:34:00.520]  revelations, talks about Obama's peace prize.
[2:34:00.520 --> 2:34:04.440]  In fact, I'll definitely do that next hour in your calls.
[2:34:04.440 --> 2:34:05.840]  David Ray Griffin is our guest.
[2:34:05.840 --> 2:34:10.240]  David, tell us about the name of your new book, how many 9-11 books you've written,
[2:34:10.240 --> 2:34:16.000]  and continue through the evidence of the fact that they blew those buildings to bits.
[2:34:16.000 --> 2:34:24.480]  This is my, believe it or not, 8th 9-11 book, not counting the little book on Osama bin
[2:34:24.480 --> 2:34:25.480]  Laden.
[2:34:25.480 --> 2:34:29.520]  If you count it, that would make nine.
[2:34:29.520 --> 2:34:36.680]  But as I say, most people have told me this one is the most convincing because of the
[2:34:36.680 --> 2:34:45.440]  massive fraud and lies in the book to deal with more of the omissions.
[2:34:45.440 --> 2:34:52.480]  Another one of these, of course, is the evidence for explosives and thermitic materials in
[2:34:52.480 --> 2:34:56.560]  particular in the dust.
[2:34:56.560 --> 2:35:04.760]  You know, but maybe not all your listeners know this rather humorous story about a reporter
[2:35:04.760 --> 2:35:12.480]  who saw the discussion between Michael Newman of NIST, who handles public relations, and
[2:35:12.480 --> 2:35:19.640]  the Stephen Jones group in which Jones and others had said, well, did you check the dust
[2:35:19.640 --> 2:35:21.520]  for thermite?
[2:35:21.520 --> 2:35:27.640]  And thermite is a generic term, which includes both ordinary and nanothermite.
[2:35:27.640 --> 2:35:32.840]  And they said, no, well, this reporter said, well, why didn't you?
[2:35:32.840 --> 2:35:38.960]  And Newman says, well, there's no use, because there was no evidence of that.
[2:35:38.960 --> 2:35:41.800]  And she says, well, how do you know there was no evidence for it?
[2:35:41.800 --> 2:35:42.800]  But he didn't look.
[2:35:42.800 --> 2:35:49.120]  And he said, look, it'd be a waste of time, and the taxpayer's money, to go looking for
[2:35:49.120 --> 2:35:51.680]  something that isn't there.
[2:35:51.680 --> 2:35:54.000]  And so this is a sample.
[2:35:54.000 --> 2:36:00.600]  You know, if people think NIST is this great organization with rigorous scientific method,
[2:36:00.600 --> 2:36:07.440]  all you have to do is read this book and you see that it's almost as laughable as that
[2:36:07.440 --> 2:36:11.960]  national geographic program.
[2:36:11.960 --> 2:36:19.600]  And in fact, I quote a former scientist who worked at NIST.
[2:36:19.600 --> 2:36:21.680]  He worked there during part of the period.
[2:36:21.680 --> 2:36:26.280]  They were working on the World Trade Center Tower report.
[2:36:26.280 --> 2:36:30.480]  And he said, you know, NIST has become totally politicized.
[2:36:30.480 --> 2:36:37.400]  And so I begin the book with that discussion that NIST has become a political, not a scientific,
[2:36:37.400 --> 2:36:40.040]  scientific agency.
[2:36:40.040 --> 2:36:44.800]  And the rest of my book bears that out on every issue, whether you're talking about
[2:36:44.800 --> 2:36:53.400]  the origin of the fires, the temperatures the steel could have reached, or the nature
[2:36:53.400 --> 2:36:56.880]  of the collapse.
[2:36:56.880 --> 2:37:04.200]  And so besides ignoring, well, the other evidence, of course, is, you know, and I'm sure you've
[2:37:04.200 --> 2:37:10.400]  talked about it a lot on your show, is the new evidence of the nanothermite in the World
[2:37:10.400 --> 2:37:14.000]  Trade Center dust.
[2:37:14.000 --> 2:37:23.760]  And this is, I think, one of the two most convincing things to the ordinary person, because,
[2:37:23.760 --> 2:37:28.160]  as Neil Tarrant said when he was asked about this, you know, the interviewer on Danish
[2:37:28.160 --> 2:37:34.160]  TV said, well, just because you found all that nanothermite in the dust, what makes
[2:37:34.160 --> 2:37:37.240]  you think that was what was used to bring down the building?
[2:37:37.240 --> 2:37:40.760]  And he said, well, why else would have it been there?
[2:37:40.760 --> 2:37:43.000]  I mean, we're not talking about a few specs.
[2:37:43.000 --> 2:37:49.920]  We're talking about an enormous amount of nanothermite that was still unexploded.
[2:37:49.920 --> 2:37:54.160]  And so they say, this is not the smoking gun, this is the loaded gun.
[2:37:54.160 --> 2:37:55.360]  The gun was still loaded.
[2:37:55.360 --> 2:37:58.200]  You put a torch to it, it explodes.
[2:37:58.200 --> 2:38:03.120]  And yet the defenders of the official story try to say, oh, this was just, you know, these
[2:38:03.120 --> 2:38:04.120]  are red chips.
[2:38:04.120 --> 2:38:05.480]  This was just primer paint.
[2:38:05.480 --> 2:38:11.760]  Well, put a match to some primer paint and see if it explodes.
[2:38:11.760 --> 2:38:17.080]  And then you have all the film footage from mainline TV crews of this white yellow metal
[2:38:17.080 --> 2:38:21.640]  just pouring out and dropping for hundreds and hundreds of feet when aluminum doesn't
[2:38:21.640 --> 2:38:24.640]  act in any way like that.
[2:38:24.640 --> 2:38:28.680]  And then you have them saying there was enough heat in Tower 1 and 2 to suddenly make the
[2:38:28.680 --> 2:38:30.720]  buildings explode top down.
[2:38:30.720 --> 2:38:36.000]  Meanwhile, columns, giant columns right next to men and women waving their shirts.
[2:38:36.000 --> 2:38:37.280]  Humans aren't burning.
[2:38:37.280 --> 2:38:42.920]  They're not melting, but giant columns right next to them are after the fire department
[2:38:42.920 --> 2:38:48.800]  had reported that in both towers, the fires were not as strong as they had been.
[2:38:48.800 --> 2:38:53.960]  And in one tower, almost completely dissipating, we have the firefighter tapes.
[2:38:53.960 --> 2:38:54.960]  Yeah.
[2:38:54.960 --> 2:38:58.360]  You know, and there's just example after example.
[2:38:58.360 --> 2:39:03.400]  Let's talk about the Van Jones affair for a second.
[2:39:03.400 --> 2:39:09.880]  The premise there of why he had to resign was that anybody who signed a document saying
[2:39:09.880 --> 2:39:16.360]  there should be a new investigation, therefore even just suggesting that maybe the official
[2:39:16.360 --> 2:39:24.520]  story wasn't true, that such a person is unworthy to be a public servant because there's something
[2:39:24.520 --> 2:39:27.480]  obviously wrong with his mind.
[2:39:27.480 --> 2:39:34.600]  Well, if people really know what the official story is, if they know how NIST explanation,
[2:39:34.600 --> 2:39:41.280]  which is the official story about the towers, if they know their explanation, there has
[2:39:41.280 --> 2:39:47.120]  to be something wrong with their mind if they believe that.
[2:39:47.120 --> 2:39:52.840]  And the most obvious example of this, now to skip to the final chapter of my book, is
[2:39:52.840 --> 2:39:58.120]  their own admission that the building came down in free fall.
[2:39:58.120 --> 2:40:01.400]  Now, we had been saying virtual free fall.
[2:40:01.400 --> 2:40:08.280]  They admitted after David Chandler proved it, that the building came down in absolute
[2:40:08.280 --> 2:40:09.280]  free fall.
[2:40:09.280 --> 2:40:12.040]  Now, this is, of course, free fall through the air, not through a vacuum.
[2:40:12.040 --> 2:40:15.760]  So there's a slight resistance from the air.
[2:40:15.760 --> 2:40:22.360]  But if you had dropped a brick off the top of the building at the same time the top floor
[2:40:22.360 --> 2:40:30.360]  of the building, the roofline, started coming down for the first two and a quarter seconds,
[2:40:30.360 --> 2:40:36.840]  the brick and the top floor of the building would have gone along at the same rate.
[2:40:36.840 --> 2:40:46.040]  Now, when NIST put out its preliminary report, what it called its draft for public comment
[2:40:46.040 --> 2:40:52.200]  in August of 2008, Shymes Zunder in a technical briefing explained
[2:40:52.200 --> 2:41:00.440]  why absolute free fall would be impossible, because he said, there are things in the way.
[2:41:00.440 --> 2:41:06.800]  And free fall means that the stuff coming down is not encountering anything, it's encountering
[2:41:06.800 --> 2:41:07.800]  zero resistance.
[2:41:07.800 --> 2:41:12.400]  And he said, well, you know, there's all that steel, all that concrete, all that stuff
[2:41:12.400 --> 2:41:17.040]  there, so that would use up energy, moving that out of the way, so it couldn't be in
[2:41:17.040 --> 2:41:18.040]  free fall.
[2:41:18.040 --> 2:41:24.320]  Well, then David Chandler got on YouTube, put a piece on there and showed, slowed it
[2:41:24.320 --> 2:41:32.000]  down, measured it, and showed that it was absolute free fall for over two seconds.
[2:41:32.000 --> 2:41:36.120]  And now NIST has had to change their story again and admit, okay, there was some free
[2:41:36.120 --> 2:41:37.120]  fall.
[2:41:37.120 --> 2:41:38.120]  Yeah.
[2:41:38.120 --> 2:41:41.080]  And, but they didn't change their theory.
[2:41:41.080 --> 2:41:49.200]  They still have a theory of progressive collapse, based on fire, and still deny, of course,
[2:41:49.200 --> 2:41:54.200]  that explosives were used, and you know, we know, anybody who knows anything about these
[2:41:54.200 --> 2:42:01.560]  things, knows that for this to come down with a horizontal roof line, virtually horizontal
[2:42:01.560 --> 2:42:10.480]  coming down, and in free fall, that means all 82 steel columns had to be removed simultaneously.
[2:42:10.480 --> 2:42:17.200]  There's no way, even if this had been a towering infernal, that fire could have caused this.
[2:42:17.200 --> 2:42:21.520]  And so now what they have is an absolute contradiction in their final report.
[2:42:21.520 --> 2:42:29.080]  They've got a theory that says free fall is impossible, as Sundar himself had explained,
[2:42:29.080 --> 2:42:34.800]  and yet they admit as an empirical fact that free fall occurred.
[2:42:34.800 --> 2:42:42.040]  And one thing I pointed out in the book is very revealing, in the draft for public comment,
[2:42:42.040 --> 2:42:47.440]  they kept saying after every statement of this nature, and this is consistent with physical
[2:42:47.440 --> 2:42:53.480]  principles, and this is consistent with physical principles, sort of ad nauseam.
[2:42:53.480 --> 2:43:00.400]  In the final report, which came out in November, they removed all of those statements.
[2:43:00.400 --> 2:43:05.200]  They were no longer claiming that their final report was consistent with the principles
[2:43:05.200 --> 2:43:06.200]  of physics.
[2:43:06.200 --> 2:43:10.080]  Now, again, you're being very academic about this, and that's very important, because that's
[2:43:10.080 --> 2:43:14.800]  who we want to really focus on this, is scientist, researchers, scholars.
[2:43:14.800 --> 2:43:21.960]  But to put it in layman terms for camp following debunkers, who really think that the official
[2:43:21.960 --> 2:43:29.960]  story is 100% true, I think it's important to note here that six of the 10 commission
[2:43:29.960 --> 2:43:35.120]  members have made statements like fraud, cover-up, criminal cover-up, there should be a criminal
[2:43:35.120 --> 2:43:41.040]  investigation, they had lawyer, farmers, got a book from the commission coming out saying
[2:43:41.040 --> 2:43:46.560]  total cover-up, a lie, we agreed day one to not tell the truth to the public.
[2:43:46.560 --> 2:43:53.480]  These are all statements, and not only have they lied the whole time, they're constantly
[2:43:53.480 --> 2:44:02.520]  changing the goalpost, and constantly changing their stories, and then making fun of us when
[2:44:02.520 --> 2:44:05.000]  we've never seen buildings do this in history.
[2:44:05.000 --> 2:44:08.280]  When you've got firemen and police saying get back, they're going to blow it up.
[2:44:08.280 --> 2:44:12.640]  When you have the PNAC document saying we need to have a giant Pearl Harbor 3000 dead
[2:44:12.640 --> 2:44:18.640]  level event, we've got lying about the WMDs, we've got Cheney wanting to blow up ships
[2:44:18.640 --> 2:44:23.680]  three years ago and blaming on the Iranians, that's now public, Foxfowl and their admiral
[2:44:23.680 --> 2:44:29.760]  were resigning, we've got Gulf of Tonkin, all these other events, I mean you'd have
[2:44:29.760 --> 2:44:39.360]  to be insane not to know that every arrow, every dotted line, everything aims an inside
[2:44:39.360 --> 2:44:44.840]  job, I mean I wish it wasn't an inside job, I wish that I didn't have to go up against
[2:44:44.840 --> 2:44:47.880]  these people, I know you were doing other things and already acclaimed before you got
[2:44:47.880 --> 2:44:53.320]  involved in this, worldwide is the best selling author and researcher and lecturer and theologian.
[2:44:53.320 --> 2:44:59.280]  I mean it's just conscience demands that they're saying the earth is flat, we have to say it's
[2:44:59.280 --> 2:45:04.600]  round and I know that's a bit of a rant there, but what's your thoughts on the statement
[2:45:04.600 --> 2:45:05.600]  I just made?
[2:45:05.600 --> 2:45:15.480]  Well, I agree and let me go back to this point about the physical impossibility of this.
[2:45:15.480 --> 2:45:24.080]  We know our most vicious criticism have come from the left, people such as George Mombio,
[2:45:24.080 --> 2:45:31.640]  people such as Alexander Coburn and those two in particular have accused us of believing
[2:45:31.640 --> 2:45:33.560]  in magic.
[2:45:33.560 --> 2:45:43.040]  Well what I just described to you about the official report on Building 7 is magic, for
[2:45:43.040 --> 2:45:50.640]  building to come down without the steel being removed by explosives in absolute free fall,
[2:45:50.640 --> 2:45:56.040]  meaning there was zero resistance, that's magic, that's a miracle.
[2:45:56.040 --> 2:46:01.480]  And as I point out in the book, it is not allowed, one of the reasons this is unscientific
[2:46:01.480 --> 2:46:08.520]  report, it is not allowed in science to appeal to a miracle, you know the joke about the
[2:46:08.520 --> 2:46:15.360]  guy up on the blackboard, the physicist, he's got all these formula covering board after
[2:46:15.360 --> 2:46:19.960]  board after board and then at the very bottom it says, and then a miracle occurred.
[2:46:19.960 --> 2:46:26.520]  Well you can't do that, but that is what NIST did, they gave us 600 pages, 600 and some
[2:46:26.520 --> 2:46:33.800]  pages of graphs and explanations and arguments and so on, and then in the final pages they
[2:46:33.800 --> 2:46:38.360]  say, well then a miracle occurred, the building came down in absolute free fall.
[2:46:38.360 --> 2:46:42.280]  You're talking about seven, three miracles occurred that day.
[2:46:42.280 --> 2:46:48.360]  Yeah, now they haven't admitted that the Twin Towers came down in absolute free fall.
[2:46:48.360 --> 2:46:55.400]  I think if somebody went back and measured those the way that Chandler did, I don't know
[2:46:55.400 --> 2:47:00.480]  that somebody has, now maybe somebody has, but I haven't seen it, maybe there would
[2:47:00.480 --> 2:47:06.520]  be a period there, a few seconds where they're coming down in absolute free fall too, that
[2:47:06.520 --> 2:47:11.640]  would be important to find out, but if even one of them has, you know, and it would still
[2:47:11.640 --> 2:47:15.800]  be a miracle if they were just coming down in virtual free fall, you can't even come
[2:47:15.800 --> 2:47:19.080]  close to free fall without explosives.
[2:47:19.080 --> 2:47:24.360]  Now they've done the calculations, pardon, well you and others and physicists and engineers
[2:47:24.360 --> 2:47:31.280]  have done the calculations with the pancake, I mean there's a major pause between each
[2:47:31.280 --> 2:47:34.760]  pancake and each structural failure.
[2:47:34.760 --> 2:47:41.520]  That's right, if you had, but NIST gave up the pancake theory later on, although that's
[2:47:41.520 --> 2:47:44.960]  complex because there are different meanings of the pancake theory.
[2:47:44.960 --> 2:47:53.960]  They gave up the theory that the fellow from MIT had articulated, but they still have an
[2:47:53.960 --> 2:47:59.960]  element of that and that's the point, there should have been a delay and there is a very
[2:47:59.960 --> 2:48:13.320]  good paper by McQueen and somebody on the Journal of 9-11 Studies showing that with the regard
[2:48:13.320 --> 2:48:19.760]  to the towers, with the south tower, this idea that the top part came down and banged
[2:48:19.760 --> 2:48:25.160]  into the lower part, there would have had to be a jolt, which would have been that delay
[2:48:25.160 --> 2:48:27.360]  you're talking about.
[2:48:27.360 --> 2:48:30.440]  And there was no jolt.
[2:48:30.440 --> 2:48:34.800]  David, I want to throw in a few other points for you to leave us here in about 10 minutes.
[2:48:34.800 --> 2:48:40.480]  I know you've been talking to Charlie Sheen because he's told me about it and he is a
[2:48:40.480 --> 2:48:44.960]  guy making $50 million a year.
[2:48:44.960 --> 2:48:46.480]  He's got his own life.
[2:48:46.480 --> 2:48:50.960]  He is a scholarly fellow despite the tabloid stuff from 10-15 years ago.
[2:48:50.960 --> 2:48:56.200]  He really has researched all this, he's fundamentally upset about it, he wrote his 20 bullet points
[2:48:56.200 --> 2:49:03.640]  and put it in a question and answer format to try to get media attention and obviously
[2:49:03.640 --> 2:49:06.800]  they'll never address his 20 points.
[2:49:06.800 --> 2:49:09.360]  They only want to attack him the man.
[2:49:09.360 --> 2:49:14.520]  Overall, what did you think about Charlie Sheen and his going public again?
[2:49:14.520 --> 2:49:21.760]  Well, I think it's great and it was paralleled in France with this famous French comedian
[2:49:21.760 --> 2:49:23.840]  John Marie Begaard.
[2:49:23.840 --> 2:49:25.360]  He's the top comedian.
[2:49:25.360 --> 2:49:34.160]  He gets thousands of people showing up for his shows and they did threaten him at first
[2:49:34.160 --> 2:49:37.840]  and said, you know, he's going to destroy your career and all that.
[2:49:37.840 --> 2:49:42.760]  He did go quiet for a while but he finally decided, look, this is just too important.
[2:49:42.760 --> 2:49:45.800]  If it hurts my career, so be it.
[2:49:45.800 --> 2:49:52.240]  And he's now making these really hilarious DVDs, little videos about various parts of
[2:49:52.240 --> 2:49:54.200]  the official story.
[2:49:54.200 --> 2:50:03.160]  So, but, you know, this shows you, even with people of the stature of Begaard and now in
[2:50:03.160 --> 2:50:09.480]  France another fellow, Matthew Kosovitz, a well-known actor over there coming out and
[2:50:09.480 --> 2:50:15.440]  Charlie Sheen over here along with Daniel Sunjata.
[2:50:15.440 --> 2:50:23.160]  The media is not going to deal with it no matter what, even if we have celebrities involved.
[2:50:23.160 --> 2:50:30.840]  And so, we can no longer rely on them and you've known this for a long time, of course,
[2:50:30.840 --> 2:50:36.320]  but the truth moving in general now needs to take an in-run around them, not rely on
[2:50:36.320 --> 2:50:38.480]  them to educate the American people.
[2:50:38.480 --> 2:50:43.480]  I agree with you, stay there David, David, we got to go to break, but I've talked to
[2:50:43.480 --> 2:50:44.480]  these actors.
[2:50:44.480 --> 2:50:46.480]  They're not doing this for attention.
[2:50:46.480 --> 2:50:48.680]  This hurts their career in many respects.
[2:50:48.680 --> 2:50:52.400]  They're doing it because they want to show the courage to other people.
[2:50:52.400 --> 2:50:58.960]  They understand it's a crime, you can't just let it hang out there, their conscience is
[2:50:58.960 --> 2:51:01.560]  demanding, they stand up, so I salute all of them.
[2:51:01.560 --> 2:51:06.000]  For thousands of years, Native American healing has been practiced in North America.
[2:51:06.000 --> 2:51:10.320]  The Native Americans discovered an astonishing healing plant called Siaga.
[2:51:10.320 --> 2:51:15.640]  This pesticide-free, wild-crafted, all-natural wonder is hand-picked by a medicine man and
[2:51:15.640 --> 2:51:19.920]  effectively combined with other all-natural and sacred ingredients into a product called

[2:52:02.840 --> 2:52:06.560]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[2:52:06.560 --> 2:52:09.720]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[2:52:09.720 --> 2:52:14.080]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans
[2:52:14.080 --> 2:52:15.080]  at home.
[2:52:15.080 --> 2:52:20.080]  We have tremendous influence on our president and Congress, and they really are calling
[2:52:20.080 --> 2:52:21.080]  the shots.
[2:52:21.080 --> 2:52:26.080]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[2:52:26.080 --> 2:52:29.360]  Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation.
[2:52:29.360 --> 2:52:35.200]  The criminal offshore cartel hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing
[2:52:35.200 --> 2:52:36.200]  world government.
[2:52:36.200 --> 2:52:40.560]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, and Arsonists, they're asking for more matches, and the Congress
[2:52:40.560 --> 2:52:42.560]  is saying, who do we make the checkout to?
[2:52:42.560 --> 2:52:48.640]  Today seems like nobody does here, and right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall
[2:52:48.640 --> 2:52:49.640]  of the Republic.

[2:54:26.960 --> 2:54:31.320]  David Ray Griffins, our guest, eight books on 9-11.
[2:54:31.320 --> 2:54:37.960]  He's in a battle with the establishment, exposing them, but absolutely, that's what
[2:54:37.960 --> 2:54:43.480]  Charlie Sheen and so many others at ASNER have said, and all the attacks they've gone
[2:54:43.480 --> 2:54:46.160]  through, they're doing this because they've looked at the evidence, and if you look at
[2:54:46.160 --> 2:54:50.440]  the evidence and it says, inside job, how could anyone in their right mind not speak
[2:54:50.440 --> 2:54:51.440]  out against it?
[2:54:51.440 --> 2:54:52.440]  It's like the banker bailout.
[2:54:52.440 --> 2:54:56.680]  Now they want another one, and either we expose these people and speak out against them or
[2:54:56.680 --> 2:55:07.560]  things are just going to get worse and worse and worse and worse and worse as a society.
[2:55:07.560 --> 2:55:15.000]  And let me mention one way, I was going to say that my new book may be useful to make
[2:55:15.000 --> 2:55:17.800]  an in-run around the mainstream media.
[2:55:17.800 --> 2:55:23.360]  The group of scientists are talking about taking that book, writing a letter, getting
[2:55:23.360 --> 2:55:29.520]  a lot of signatures, and sending a report to the National Science Foundation because
[2:55:29.520 --> 2:55:36.000]  it has said, if you know cases of scientific fraud, please report them to us.
[2:55:36.000 --> 2:55:42.800]  And there's also the Union of Concerned Scientists, they're also concerned about fraud, and there's
[2:55:42.800 --> 2:55:50.760]  also the Commerce Department, now under new management, that NIST is an agency of.
[2:55:50.760 --> 2:55:56.600]  And so they're going to send my book along with the letters explaining why they're reporting
[2:55:56.600 --> 2:56:00.480]  fraud to these three agencies.
[2:56:00.480 --> 2:56:04.680]  And so this may be one way that we can get something.
[2:56:04.680 --> 2:56:05.680]  It's a long shot.
[2:56:05.680 --> 2:56:09.400]  These are all long shots, but at least there may be a chance here.
[2:56:09.400 --> 2:56:13.760]  But if we fire enough torpedoes of truth, we're going to sink their lives, we just continue
[2:56:13.760 --> 2:56:15.040]  to have breakthrough by breakthrough.
[2:56:15.040 --> 2:56:20.080]  In fact, in closing, we have a high-level prime minister saying he went into a security
[2:56:20.080 --> 2:56:24.080]  briefing that morning five to ten minutes before the tower collapsed and was told it's
[2:56:24.080 --> 2:56:25.280]  going to collapse.
[2:56:25.280 --> 2:56:26.280]  Same things Giuliani said.
[2:56:26.280 --> 2:56:30.080]  I mean, it just piles up and piles up and piles up.
[2:56:30.080 --> 2:56:31.080]  Yeah.
[2:56:31.080 --> 2:56:39.920]  And you know, one thing I mentioned in an article on Blogger, 9-11 Blogger, is this, you know,
[2:56:39.920 --> 2:56:46.160]  another left organization that is critical of us, the new statesman, put out a report
[2:56:46.160 --> 2:56:53.080]  a few weeks ago, a front-page story saying 50 people in the world who count, rather absurdly,
[2:56:53.080 --> 2:57:00.400]  they included me in that, that I was listed as number 41, as if I'm the 41st most important
[2:57:00.400 --> 2:57:02.120]  person in the world.
[2:57:02.120 --> 2:57:06.840]  That of course is ridiculous, but what they were showing recognition of is that the 9-11
[2:57:06.840 --> 2:57:13.360]  truth movement is, because that's what they put me there, they said top truther, they're
[2:57:13.360 --> 2:57:16.440]  recognizing the importance of the 9-11 truth movement.
[2:57:16.440 --> 2:57:22.080]  So even though almost all the time they either ignore us or ridicule us, they know about us,
[2:57:22.080 --> 2:57:25.920]  they know we're gathering strength, they know that we're important.
[2:57:25.920 --> 2:57:26.920]  Absolutely.
[2:57:26.920 --> 2:57:29.680]  Fire out the name of the book one more time for folks.
[2:57:29.680 --> 2:57:35.040]  The mysterious collapse of World Trade Center 7, why the final official report about World
[2:57:35.040 --> 2:57:42.280]  Trade, about 9-11, is unscientific and false, found at all good bookstores and if you don't
[2:57:42.280 --> 2:57:46.320]  have a good bookstore, amazon.com.
[2:57:46.320 --> 2:57:51.120]  David Regrethen, always great to speak with you, Godspeed, we'll talk to you again soon.
[2:57:51.120 --> 2:57:52.520]  Thank you, Alex.
[2:57:52.520 --> 2:57:54.720]  There he goes, ladies and gentlemen.
[2:57:54.720 --> 2:57:59.080]  We are going to start the fourth and final hour.
[2:57:59.080 --> 2:58:07.600]  We are now 25 hours and two minutes away from Fall of the Republic, this information warfare
[2:58:07.600 --> 2:58:14.800]  salvo launching, dropping with all the people that are in it, G. Edward Griffin, Gerald
[2:58:14.800 --> 2:58:23.040]  Salente, Jesse Ventura, Alan Watt, professors, just the list goes on and on of who was in
[2:58:23.040 --> 2:58:26.040]  this film.
[2:58:26.040 --> 2:58:28.640]  It is up to you how explosive this documentary is going to be.
[2:58:28.640 --> 2:58:33.480]  If it's as explosive as Obama deception, it will be hugely successful, but we think it's
[2:58:33.480 --> 2:58:35.880]  going to be even bigger, but that is up to you now.
[2:58:35.880 --> 2:58:43.360]  I've made the film, I'm giving you the ball.
[2:58:43.360 --> 2:58:45.960]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[2:58:45.960 --> 2:58:51.640]  Be sure to visit GCNLive.com today.
[2:58:51.640 --> 2:58:54.640]  Hello this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[2:58:54.640 --> 2:58:59.000]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition
[2:58:59.000 --> 2:59:00.000]  do you want?
[2:59:00.000 --> 2:59:05.560]  My answer would be all I can get in the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones.
[2:59:05.560 --> 2:59:07.000]  What is your only ammunition?
[2:59:07.000 --> 2:59:08.240]  How much do you want?
[2:59:08.240 --> 2:59:09.240]  When do you want it?
[2:59:09.240 --> 2:59:11.280]  Now or after the battle starts?
[2:59:11.280 --> 2:59:12.400]  When will you need it?
[2:59:12.400 --> 2:59:14.520]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[2:59:14.520 --> 2:59:15.840]  Will there be any food?
[2:59:15.840 --> 2:59:17.320]  Will it make your children sick?
[2:59:17.320 --> 2:59:21.440]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center
[2:59:21.440 --> 2:59:22.600]  and be immunized?
[2:59:22.600 --> 2:59:26.400]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[2:59:26.400 --> 2:59:30.000]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[2:59:30.000 --> 2:59:31.240]  How much will you need?
[2:59:31.240 --> 2:59:32.240]  We don't know.
[2:59:32.240 --> 2:59:33.240]  How much do you want?
[2:59:33.240 --> 2:59:34.240]  All you can get.
[2:59:34.240 --> 2:59:35.240]  I'm Alex Jones.
[2:59:35.240 --> 2:59:38.240]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[2:59:38.240 --> 2:59:45.760]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at eFoodsDirect.com.
[2:59:45.760 --> 3:00:08.560]  Again that number, 1-800-409-5633 Waging war on corruption, Alex Jones on the GCM Radio
[3:00:08.560 --> 3:00:25.200]  News.
[3:00:25.200 --> 3:00:27.200]  Here we are in the fourth hour today.
[3:00:27.200 --> 3:00:31.800]  Coming up later in the hour, I'm going to play the second half live.
[3:00:31.800 --> 3:00:36.680]  Number 14, my interview with Jesse Ventura, Prison Planet.tv viewers watching live right
[3:00:36.680 --> 3:00:37.680]  now.
[3:00:37.680 --> 3:00:38.680]  You'll see it.
[3:00:38.680 --> 3:00:43.680]  It's a great audio interview for all the wonderful radio listeners that are out there.
[3:00:43.680 --> 3:00:48.920]  I haven't really spent any time announcing this since Charlie Sheen was on.
[3:00:48.920 --> 3:00:51.120]  And I know we've gotten more than 10.
[3:00:51.120 --> 3:00:57.280]  We got like five yesterday and I think they said we got more than five in the last week.
[3:00:57.280 --> 3:00:58.280]  These are already coming in.
[3:00:58.280 --> 3:01:00.000]  In fact, give me a close shot of this, guys.
[3:01:00.000 --> 3:01:04.240]  If you go to 20minuteswiththepresident.com, in fact, we'll pull that web address up.
[3:01:04.240 --> 3:01:08.360]  It's just 20withthepresident.com.
[3:01:08.360 --> 3:01:17.800]  Awesome website put together by Curt and M.O. and Janae Meadows, our graphics lady.
[3:01:17.800 --> 3:01:23.360]  The deadline is to get it into us, the Charlie Sheen 20 minutes with the president contest
[3:01:23.360 --> 3:01:26.480]  by November 15th on that Sunday.
[3:01:26.480 --> 3:01:33.160]  Then Charlie and I will have Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday to judge.
[3:01:33.160 --> 3:01:35.960]  And we're shooting for that Thursday or Friday to announce it.
[3:01:35.960 --> 3:01:36.960]  I got to talk to Charlie.
[3:01:36.960 --> 3:01:39.320]  I've been talking to him in about four or five days.
[3:01:39.320 --> 3:01:43.520]  I got to talk to him, find out when he wants to be available because he's very busy to
[3:01:43.520 --> 3:01:47.360]  come on the show and to announce who the winners are.
[3:01:47.360 --> 3:01:52.520]  But you have got 20 days.
[3:01:52.520 --> 3:01:54.960]  And by the way, you can make two or three entries if you want.
[3:01:54.960 --> 3:01:57.260]  You can make 10 entries if you want.
[3:01:57.260 --> 3:01:58.400]  You can do it with actors.
[3:01:58.400 --> 3:01:59.720]  You can do it with video clips.
[3:01:59.720 --> 3:02:02.200]  You can do it with two black guys, two white guys.
[3:02:02.200 --> 3:02:04.840]  Two aborigines, two women.
[3:02:04.840 --> 3:02:07.000]  It doesn't matter.
[3:02:07.000 --> 3:02:09.680]  The bullet points are the most important part to cover.
[3:02:09.680 --> 3:02:14.960]  Read the contest rules at 20 minutes with the president.com.
[3:02:14.960 --> 3:02:17.160]  That's 20 minutes with the president.com.
[3:02:17.160 --> 3:02:22.200]  And again, we're going to pull that web address up for people watching on prisonplanet.tv.
[3:02:22.200 --> 3:02:27.600]  We have a banner up on infowars.com on the front page right below the flash player for
[3:02:27.600 --> 3:02:28.840]  the radio show.
[3:02:28.840 --> 3:02:30.480]  You'll see Charlie Sheen's face.
[3:02:30.480 --> 3:02:32.480]  Click on that.
[3:02:32.480 --> 3:02:34.480]  That will take you to 20minuteswithpresident.com.
[3:02:34.480 --> 3:02:35.480]  We're getting a lot of entries now.
[3:02:35.480 --> 3:02:41.280]  I'm going to have Kurt Nemo today and tomorrow start just posting some of the entries and
[3:02:41.280 --> 3:02:43.960]  articles up on infowars.com.
[3:02:43.960 --> 3:02:50.640]  We're going to be posting them all every few days as they come in with links up on 20 minutes
[3:02:50.640 --> 3:02:51.640]  with the president.com.
[3:02:51.640 --> 3:02:57.560]  As you can look at the entries, but there is the site, gorgeous site.
[3:02:57.560 --> 3:03:02.400]  And again, you can watch the submissions right there at that third link there at the bottom.
[3:03:02.400 --> 3:03:04.280]  I don't think we posted any of the submissions yet.
[3:03:04.280 --> 3:03:06.160]  They just started pouring in last week.
[3:03:06.160 --> 3:03:10.000]  And I've just been trying to find time to watch them because we're busy releasing Follow
[3:03:10.000 --> 3:03:13.920]  the Republic.
[3:03:13.920 --> 3:03:19.160]  And old promotion to do with that, but it is all coming up.
[3:03:19.160 --> 3:03:25.080]  And the whole point of this is whoever you are, if you do an entry using the script
[3:03:25.080 --> 3:03:29.680]  of 20 minutes with the president in any adaptation you wish, the one guy judging into Charlie
[3:03:29.680 --> 3:03:41.000]  Sheen, I'll give him my input first place $14,000 second place $1,000 third place $500.
[3:03:41.000 --> 3:03:44.800]  Because when I told Charlie said, yeah, we'll do a $10,000 prize, he then said, let's make
[3:03:44.800 --> 3:03:48.680]  it where after taxes, you get $10,000.
[3:03:48.680 --> 3:03:54.120]  And that's about $13,500, but I thought, you know, 14,000 is actually making sure you
[3:03:54.120 --> 3:03:55.920]  get 10 grand after taxes.
[3:03:55.920 --> 3:04:00.760]  This is a real $10,000 prize, but that's not the reason.
[3:04:00.760 --> 3:04:05.120]  The reason to get involved is this will put the 20 points and the 20 minutes with the
[3:04:05.120 --> 3:04:09.640]  president 2020 vision squarely in front of the American people.
[3:04:09.640 --> 3:04:12.640]  And no doubt the hundreds of entries, no doubt we're going to get hundreds.
[3:04:12.640 --> 3:04:16.640]  The good, the bad, the ugly, the, you know, the mediocre, the excellent, these are going
[3:04:16.640 --> 3:04:21.320]  to be seen some millions of times, some thousands of times, regardless, tens of millions of
[3:04:21.320 --> 3:04:24.080]  views of 20 minutes with the president.
[3:04:24.080 --> 3:04:27.040]  You can't buy media attention like that for 911 truth.
[3:04:27.040 --> 3:04:32.880]  If you tried to buy $14,000 worth of ads that wouldn't buy you 50 ads, 100 ads on local
[3:04:32.880 --> 3:04:33.880]  TV.
[3:04:33.880 --> 3:04:41.180]  So just one more thing we're doing, Charlie Sheen's idea that we've got a surprise was
[3:04:41.180 --> 3:04:45.920]  actually his dad's idea, Martin Sheen at dinner.
[3:04:45.920 --> 3:04:50.160]  And I'll tell you about that when we get back, okay.
[3:04:50.160 --> 3:04:54.420]  And there's more coming up with 20 minutes with the president as well.
[3:04:54.420 --> 3:04:58.080]  So you'll want to stay with us on the other side of this quick break.
[3:04:58.080 --> 3:05:01.000]  Your calls coming up 1-800-25-99231.
[3:05:01.000 --> 3:05:05.640]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want
[3:05:05.640 --> 3:05:06.640]  you to eat.
[3:05:06.640 --> 3:05:10.120]  Will you continue to be their profit center buying their processed food that makes you
[3:05:10.120 --> 3:05:13.080]  sick, go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[3:05:13.080 --> 3:05:14.760]  You don't have to cooperate.
[3:05:14.760 --> 3:05:16.000]  There is a solution.
[3:05:16.000 --> 3:05:20.160]  Inner health botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love have been providing products
[3:05:20.160 --> 3:05:24.440]  for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.

[3:05:37.040 --> 3:05:38.040]  manager.
[3:05:38.040 --> 3:05:42.760]  I love their NutriCafe, great organic coffee infused with herbal extracts to boost your

[3:08:09.760 --> 3:08:20.560]  All right, we're back live, we're going to open the phones up on any issue you wish you
[3:08:20.560 --> 3:08:23.960]  discuss at 1-800-259-9231.
[3:08:23.960 --> 3:08:30.800]  I have my three stacks of news here that I intend to go through as well.
[3:08:30.800 --> 3:08:33.560]  This is just pretty much the raw interview.
[3:08:33.560 --> 3:08:39.240]  Going up in the next 20 minutes at infowars.com and then prismplanet.com will be the two-part
[3:08:39.240 --> 3:08:43.720]  interview with Jesse Ventura, where he talks about Obama and his peace prize, where he
[3:08:43.720 --> 3:08:49.280]  talks about broken promises, the war, where he talks about the two-party system.
[3:08:49.280 --> 3:08:52.400]  He gets in the 9-11 commission going public.
[3:08:52.400 --> 3:08:55.480]  Many of them saying the entire investigation's a fraud.
[3:08:55.480 --> 3:08:59.160]  He talks about a host of issues with me when I was out there last Wednesday.
[3:08:59.160 --> 3:09:04.440]  We were in a warehouse here off the side of where we were shooting, and so that's what
[3:09:04.440 --> 3:09:07.480]  you're going to see in the background if you're a prismplanet.tv viewer.
[3:09:07.480 --> 3:09:13.920]  If you're not a prismplanet.tv member, folks, we air stuff much of it here exclusively first.
[3:09:13.920 --> 3:09:14.920]  At least two hours.
[3:09:14.920 --> 3:09:19.360]  Today, we're doing three and a half hours simulcast on prismplanet.tv with the radio
[3:09:19.360 --> 3:09:20.360]  show.
[3:09:20.360 --> 3:09:25.600]  It turns into a complete television show with video clips, audio, documents, all of it.
[3:09:25.600 --> 3:09:27.440]  And it's your prismplanet.tv membership.
[3:09:27.440 --> 3:09:31.760]  I want to thank all of you that are members that makes what we're doing here possible.
[3:09:31.760 --> 3:09:34.720]  You're the people making so much of this possible, and I want to thank you.
[3:09:34.720 --> 3:09:40.120]  So when you see a film like Follow the Republic coming out, you financed this.
[3:09:40.120 --> 3:09:41.120]  You did this.
[3:09:41.120 --> 3:09:42.800]  So I salute you, and I thank you.
[3:09:42.800 --> 3:09:49.520]  And it is premiering tomorrow, 3 p.m. Central, when the show ends, at prismplanet.tv.
[3:09:49.520 --> 3:09:56.000]  And I'm begging you, start your engines, burn the DivEx copies off the site, burn them
[3:09:56.000 --> 3:09:57.000]  to disc.
[3:09:57.000 --> 3:10:00.280]  I want to see this explode big time from day one.
[3:10:00.280 --> 3:10:04.160]  This system is afraid of the American people when you take action.
[3:10:04.160 --> 3:10:06.080]  I'll talk more about that before the show ends.
[3:10:06.080 --> 3:10:12.320]  But as for Charlie Sheen 9-1-1 contest, when $14,000 spread the truth virally, all of you
[3:10:12.320 --> 3:10:14.320]  that make entries win.
[3:10:14.320 --> 3:10:19.320]  And then, yes, got to say it was Martin Sheen's idea, want to give him credit, we're sitting
[3:10:19.320 --> 3:10:23.480]  around the table talking about the contest, it was Charlie and mine's idea, about four
[3:10:23.480 --> 3:10:28.360]  or five days before we launched 20 months with the president at Charlie's home in Los
[3:10:28.360 --> 3:10:33.840]  Angeles while the fires were burning nearby and raining ash down on us, literally outside.
[3:10:33.840 --> 3:10:39.160]  But beautiful sunsets, though, big, red sunsets out there with the fires.
[3:10:39.160 --> 3:10:47.200]  And Martin had the idea of taking little segments of each one of the contest entries and clipping
[3:10:47.200 --> 3:10:54.480]  those together later with a big master video that Aaron Dixon, myself, will put together.
[3:10:54.480 --> 3:10:57.680]  You saw how good that piece, me and Aaron, put together, mainly Aaron.
[3:10:57.680 --> 3:11:01.680]  I directed it, but he did most of the work on that incredible piece that's an extra on
[3:11:01.680 --> 3:11:05.880]  this DVD, Charlie Sheen's message to the president.
[3:11:05.880 --> 3:11:10.040]  One of the extras, there it is, right there.
[3:11:10.040 --> 3:11:15.160]  It's up on 20minuteswiththepresident.com, be sure and check out the new site.
[3:11:15.160 --> 3:11:18.760]  And then Charlie does have some other ideas for 9-Eleven Truth down the road, I'll just
[3:11:18.760 --> 3:11:24.600]  leave it at that, but the winner will also be on the show with Charlie and myself coming
[3:11:24.600 --> 3:11:31.480]  up about a week or so after we'll announce the winners on that Thursday or Friday and
[3:11:31.480 --> 3:11:36.640]  probably end up having the winner, we'll have to call them beforehand.
[3:11:36.640 --> 3:11:39.440]  We'll either have the winner on that day with us or the next week because it'll take some
[3:11:39.440 --> 3:11:44.120]  time to judge them, then get a hold of the winner and then have them on with Charlie.
[3:11:44.120 --> 3:11:48.120]  So that's some of the legwork we've got to do, so it's hard to pick an exact date.
[3:11:48.120 --> 3:11:55.440]  But within a week of November 15th, when you've got to have your submissions in, we will announce
[3:11:55.440 --> 3:11:58.680]  who the winner is and then have them on the show with Charlie, that's probably the easiest
[3:11:58.680 --> 3:11:59.680]  way to do it.
[3:11:59.680 --> 3:12:03.360]  Okay, so 20minuteswiththepresident.com, very excited.
[3:12:03.360 --> 3:12:04.960]  People are very excited about it.
[3:12:04.960 --> 3:12:07.040]  It's having an explosive response already.
[3:12:07.040 --> 3:12:10.320]  I'm surprised how many submissions we've got already coming in and again we'll be linking
[3:12:10.320 --> 3:12:15.800]  them all up at 20minuteswiththepresident.com for everybody to see in the days to come.
[3:12:15.800 --> 3:12:18.920]  In fact, I asked Kurt Nemo this morning to do it, but he's so busy with 100 other things.
[3:12:18.920 --> 3:12:20.920]  It should be up by tomorrow, if not today.
[3:12:20.920 --> 3:12:25.600]  20minuteswiththepresident.com will also post a lot of the entries up on infowars.com.
[3:12:25.600 --> 3:12:31.600]  Okay, let's go ahead and go to this part two of the Jesse Ventura interview, part one
[3:12:31.600 --> 3:12:36.480]  and two are going to be posted again in the next 20 minutes up on infowars.com for you
[3:12:36.480 --> 3:12:38.760]  to spread virally as well.
[3:12:38.760 --> 3:12:43.760]  Here is part of my talk with Jesse Ventura last Wednesday in Los Angeles.
[3:12:43.760 --> 3:12:49.600]  Governor, in closing 9-11, it's now come out that six of the 10 commissioners are on record
[3:12:49.600 --> 3:12:53.320]  saying that they believe there should be a new investigation and that the Pentagon was
[3:12:53.320 --> 3:12:54.320]  deceptive.
[3:12:54.320 --> 3:12:56.760]  That's even been in the Washington Post.
[3:12:56.760 --> 3:12:59.360]  Many people have called for a new investigation.
[3:12:59.360 --> 3:13:03.680]  Do you think, A, we should have an investigation and B, that we'll ever see one?
[3:13:03.680 --> 3:13:09.480]  A, I think we absolutely should have a real investigation, an investigation where you
[3:13:09.480 --> 3:13:17.440]  give subpoena power to where people are not allowed to testify together and I view the
[3:13:17.440 --> 3:13:21.600]  Warren Commission and the 9-11 Commission, they weren't there to seek the truth.
[3:13:21.600 --> 3:13:25.240]  They were there to cover up the truth and that's what they were designed to do in my
[3:13:25.240 --> 3:13:26.240]  opinion.
[3:13:26.240 --> 3:13:29.200]  Absolutely, I think there should be a new investigation.
[3:13:29.200 --> 3:13:30.320]  Will there be one?
[3:13:30.320 --> 3:13:32.400]  I have my doubts on that.
[3:13:32.400 --> 3:13:37.360]  Now, what will have to happen is it will have to come from the grassroots.
[3:13:37.360 --> 3:13:40.000]  There will have to be so much political pressure put on.
[3:13:40.000 --> 3:13:42.040]  Well, like right now, it goes even farther.
[3:13:42.040 --> 3:13:47.240]  Alex, did you see the thing where the attorney for the 9-11 Commission, the lead attorney,
[3:13:47.240 --> 3:13:48.240]  Mr. Farmer?
[3:13:48.240 --> 3:13:50.240]  He's got a book coming out saying it was all a cover-up.
[3:13:50.240 --> 3:13:55.840]  Well, he came out and said that at some point the government decided the United States people
[3:13:55.840 --> 3:13:57.640]  were not going to hear the truth.
[3:13:57.640 --> 3:14:00.840]  Now, what more smoking gun do we need than that?
[3:14:00.840 --> 3:14:02.600]  Are you listening, Geraldo?
[3:14:02.600 --> 3:14:03.600]  Absolutely.
[3:14:03.600 --> 3:14:05.960]  They say we're crazy, we're evil, we're bad.
[3:14:05.960 --> 3:14:10.720]  Six of the 10 Commission members, two of their four lawyers, the head lawyer, is saying it's
[3:14:10.720 --> 3:14:12.040]  a fraud and a cover-up.
[3:14:12.040 --> 3:14:16.160]  Three members are saying there should be criminal charges against the White House of the Pentagon
[3:14:16.160 --> 3:14:20.840]  for lying, saying that they did lie to them, but that the decision was made to deceive
[3:14:20.840 --> 3:14:22.600]  the American people.
[3:14:22.600 --> 3:14:27.960]  And that's why, Jesse, I really appreciate your courage in going public for 9-11 Truth
[3:14:27.960 --> 3:14:32.920]  because if we don't expose this, they're going to continue to commit these Gulf of Tonkens,
[3:14:32.920 --> 3:14:35.040]  these Operation Age Acts, these programs.
[3:14:35.040 --> 3:14:36.040]  Absolutely.
[3:14:36.040 --> 3:14:41.240]  And it comes back to the very thing that people need to remember and remember this, dissension
[3:14:41.240 --> 3:14:44.040]  is the greatest form of patriotism.
[3:14:44.040 --> 3:14:49.600]  If you don't hold your elected officials' feet to the fire, for lack of a better term,
[3:14:49.600 --> 3:14:51.740]  you are going to get bad government.
[3:14:51.740 --> 3:14:52.740]  Remember that.
[3:14:52.740 --> 3:14:54.840]  You don't want to go along to get along.
[3:14:54.840 --> 3:14:56.920]  Governor, great seeing you.
[3:14:56.920 --> 3:15:05.640]  Really as always, Alex, great to talk to you.
[3:15:05.640 --> 3:15:10.160]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[3:15:10.160 --> 3:15:13.320]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[3:15:13.320 --> 3:15:18.400]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans
[3:15:18.400 --> 3:15:19.400]  at home.
[3:15:19.400 --> 3:15:24.560]  They have tremendous influence on our president in Congress, and they really are calling the
[3:15:24.560 --> 3:15:26.880]  shots.
[3:15:26.880 --> 3:15:32.040]  Now is the time for all good men and women to come to the aid of their country.
[3:15:32.040 --> 3:15:39.040]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[3:15:39.040 --> 3:15:44.920]  One of the greatest events in history is taking place before our very eyes.
[3:15:44.920 --> 3:15:56.720]  It's up to every man, woman and child in the United States to decide.
[3:15:56.720 --> 3:16:01.360]  Whether we're going to be fooled by the slick propaganda of the social engineers, or whether
[3:16:01.360 --> 3:16:04.560]  we're going to restore the Republic.
[3:16:04.560 --> 3:16:09.760]  We have seen this erosion to the point where today seems like nobody does care, and right
[3:16:09.760 --> 3:16:19.360]  now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[3:16:19.360 --> 3:16:21.360]  Who's going to soak up the derivatives?
[3:16:21.360 --> 3:16:22.920]  Who's going to soak up the debt?
[3:16:22.920 --> 3:16:24.720]  Who's going to be penalized?
[3:16:24.720 --> 3:16:30.200]  Ken Ronds, CEO, Ken Lay, was involved in discussions with you at the White House about helping
[3:16:30.200 --> 3:16:34.720]  develop this type of policy, this trading scheme.
[3:16:34.720 --> 3:16:35.720]  I don't know.
[3:16:35.720 --> 3:16:39.440]  Do you think it's consistent with the spirit of that provision of constitution to hand
[3:16:39.440 --> 3:16:41.720]  out a half a trillion dollars to foreigners?
[3:16:41.720 --> 3:16:45.400]  Will we choose liberty, or will we choose tyranny?
[3:16:45.400 --> 3:16:47.960]  The Republic is hanging by a thread.
[3:16:47.960 --> 3:16:48.960]  You don't have a president.
[3:16:48.960 --> 3:16:50.960]  You have an actor.
[3:16:50.960 --> 3:16:51.960]  Tim Geithner?
[3:16:51.960 --> 3:16:54.840]  Okay, I didn't communicate to my guys.
[3:16:54.840 --> 3:16:59.360]  We have like an 11-minute interview with Jesse Ventura, and I said I want to play the second
[3:16:59.360 --> 3:17:01.160]  half of it.
[3:17:01.160 --> 3:17:03.600]  And so we started in the second half of the second half.
[3:17:03.600 --> 3:17:08.040]  So what I'm going to do is I'm going to cue this up to the front, and we'll go out to
[3:17:08.040 --> 3:17:10.560]  break with the first part of the second part.
[3:17:10.560 --> 3:17:15.200]  So from the beginning of that file you have, go ahead and play it.
[3:17:15.200 --> 3:17:16.200]  Thank you.
[3:17:16.200 --> 3:17:24.040]  I'm Tim Geithner, and this is the Alex Jones show.
[3:17:24.040 --> 3:17:27.040]  Why do you think Obama's approval rating has dropped in the low 40s?
[3:17:27.040 --> 3:17:28.040]  Because he had to make hard decisions, and he's making them.
[3:17:28.040 --> 3:17:32.680]  Any elected official, hey, when I first got elected, my approval rating was, I think,
[3:17:32.680 --> 3:17:35.840]  71 or 72, the highest in Minnesota history.
[3:17:35.840 --> 3:17:42.600]  Well, by the time you're in office, the length of time, every time you make a decision, Alex,
[3:17:42.600 --> 3:17:44.080]  someone's not going to like it.
[3:17:44.080 --> 3:17:47.480]  You're going to have people that do like it, but you're going to have people that don't.
[3:17:47.480 --> 3:17:52.760]  And too many of us are one-issue people, so that when a public official makes a decision
[3:17:52.760 --> 3:17:58.080]  on that one issue that maybe impacts you or you feel negative about, all of a sudden now
[3:17:58.080 --> 3:18:01.040]  you have a negative agenda towards this elected official.
[3:18:01.040 --> 3:18:04.040]  So it's a natural thing that happens, yes.
[3:18:04.040 --> 3:18:08.880]  When you're first elected, your approval rating is sky-high.
[3:18:08.880 --> 3:18:13.600]  But the longer you're in office, I actually sunk below 50% at one point.
[3:18:13.600 --> 3:18:19.360]  I was down to 45, and the press came at me, and they said, well, you've been as high as
[3:18:19.360 --> 3:18:22.280]  70%, your approval rating's now under 50.
[3:18:22.280 --> 3:18:26.280]  Well, I looked at him and said, well, gee, if I'm at 45, I'm seven points up, because
[3:18:26.280 --> 3:18:28.360]  I won with 37.
[3:18:28.360 --> 3:18:32.440]  Remember in a three-person race, those numbers dropped drastically.
[3:18:32.440 --> 3:18:38.240]  So no matter even at 45%, I was still seven points higher than what I won the election
[3:18:38.240 --> 3:18:39.240]  with.
[3:18:39.240 --> 3:18:40.800]  So how can they accuse me of failing?
[3:18:40.800 --> 3:18:41.800]  Absolutely.
[3:18:41.800 --> 3:18:42.800]  Two final questions.
[3:18:42.800 --> 3:18:46.000]  I'll let you get back to working on the TV show here, by the way, I'm honored to be
[3:18:46.000 --> 3:18:47.000]  part of it.
[3:18:47.000 --> 3:18:50.080]  We're honored to have you.
[3:18:50.080 --> 3:18:51.680]  I'm excited to be involved.
[3:18:51.680 --> 3:18:56.160]  No, it's great getting to hang out with you, but seriously, you were against the banker
[3:18:56.160 --> 3:18:59.800]  bailout back last year when they first launched it.
[3:18:59.800 --> 3:19:01.400]  Now they want a new bailout.
[3:19:01.400 --> 3:19:02.760]  They did a bait and switch.
[3:19:02.760 --> 3:19:04.960]  They kept the trillions of dollars for themselves.
[3:19:04.960 --> 3:19:06.360]  They're not loaning it.
[3:19:06.360 --> 3:19:07.360]  What's your view on that?
[3:19:07.360 --> 3:19:11.440]  Well, if you want a true bailout, you have to do what I did in Minnesota.
[3:19:11.440 --> 3:19:16.640]  When we had a budget surplus in Minnesota, I gave the money directly to the people.
[3:19:16.640 --> 3:19:21.440]  If you want to truly stimulate the economy, give it to the public.
[3:19:21.440 --> 3:19:22.440]  Absolutely.
[3:19:22.440 --> 3:19:24.120]  Because we will spend it.
[3:19:24.120 --> 3:19:26.120]  And will that not stimulate the economy?
[3:19:26.120 --> 3:19:27.880]  Isn't that what they want?
[3:19:27.880 --> 3:19:30.280]  Us with money spending our money?
[3:19:30.280 --> 3:19:31.280]  But they're not.
[3:19:31.280 --> 3:19:32.280]  They're hoarding it.
[3:19:32.280 --> 3:19:34.960]  Well, they're giving it to the banks rather than the people.
[3:19:34.960 --> 3:19:36.480]  And the banks are like a middleman.
[3:19:36.480 --> 3:19:38.800]  And then they loan it back to us at interest.
[3:19:38.800 --> 3:19:39.800]  Exactly.
[3:19:39.800 --> 3:19:46.560]  If you truly want a stimulus package, in my opinion, you give the money directly to the
[3:19:46.560 --> 3:19:47.560]  people.
[3:19:47.560 --> 3:19:51.640]  What do you think of Ron Paul and others move to audit the private secretive Federal Reserve?
[3:19:51.640 --> 3:19:54.400]  I think it's a great idea.
[3:19:54.400 --> 3:19:56.400]  I don't agree with Ron Paul on everything.
[3:19:56.400 --> 3:19:59.400]  One thing is called life.
[3:19:59.400 --> 3:20:04.440]  Men, are you urinating more frequently?
[3:20:04.440 --> 3:20:06.400]  Do you wake up to urinate?
[3:20:06.400 --> 3:20:08.080]  Don't ignore your prostate health.
[3:20:08.080 --> 3:20:12.160]  See your doctor for checkups and call for a free bottle of beta-prostate.
[3:20:12.160 --> 3:20:16.600]  Beta-prostate is a natural supplement that helps your body support prostate health.
[3:20:16.600 --> 3:20:21.680]  Your prostate affects the quality of your life, including your sleeping habits and intimacy.
[3:20:21.680 --> 3:20:27.080]  Beta-prostate has plant sterols shown to support healthy urine flow and healthy sleeping habits.
[3:20:27.080 --> 3:20:32.520]  And beta-prostate is so powerful, you'd have to take 100 sawpaw metal capsules to get the
[3:20:32.520 --> 3:20:36.080]  same plant sterols found in one beta-prostate.
[3:20:36.080 --> 3:20:39.120]  Few customers can get a free bottle of beta-prostate.
[3:20:39.120 --> 3:20:40.800]  You only pay shipping and handling.
[3:20:40.800 --> 3:20:46.480]  To get your free bottle of beta-prostate, call 1-800-360-8306.
[3:20:46.480 --> 3:20:49.440]  That's 1-800-360-8306.
[3:20:49.440 --> 3:20:52.520]  This offer is for one free bottle per household.
[3:20:52.520 --> 3:20:55.360]  Call now and try beta-prostate for free.
[3:20:55.360 --> 3:20:58.360]  Call 1-800-360-8306.
[3:20:58.360 --> 3:21:03.120]  That's 1-800-360-8306.
[3:21:03.120 --> 3:21:06.880]  Thousands of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[3:21:06.880 --> 3:21:10.040]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[3:21:10.040 --> 3:21:14.400]  As we're finishing off this agenda, we're pulling the rug from underneath the Americans
[3:21:14.400 --> 3:21:15.400]  at home.
[3:21:15.400 --> 3:21:20.560]  We have tremendous influence on our president and Congress, and they really are calling the
[3:21:20.560 --> 3:21:21.560]  shots.
[3:21:21.560 --> 3:21:26.360]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us, as American citizens, to pay attention.
[3:21:26.360 --> 3:21:29.680]  Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation.
[3:21:29.680 --> 3:21:35.520]  A criminal off-short cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes, constructing
[3:21:35.520 --> 3:21:36.520]  world government.
[3:21:36.520 --> 3:21:38.920]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists.
[3:21:38.920 --> 3:21:42.840]  They're asking for more matches, and the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[3:21:42.840 --> 3:21:48.920]  Today seems like nobody does care, and right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall
[3:21:48.920 --> 3:21:49.920]  of the Republic.
[3:21:49.920 --> 3:21:56.360]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at infowars.com or watch it online right

[3:22:01.360 --> 3:22:04.760]  Before you throw away your used batteries, you need to listen to this.
[3:22:04.760 --> 3:22:06.920]  Now going green can save money.
[3:22:06.920 --> 3:22:10.960]  Go green and save money by giving life to your used batteries by charging them with
[3:22:10.960 --> 3:22:12.440]  the Renaissance Charger.
[3:22:12.440 --> 3:22:16.680]  The Renaissance Charger uses a new revolutionary battery charging technology that effectively
[3:22:16.680 --> 3:22:20.440]  extends a life of new batteries and gives new life to used batteries.
[3:22:20.440 --> 3:22:26.200]  Invented by legendary audio genius John Bedini, this unique and patented charging system rejuvenates
[3:22:26.200 --> 3:22:31.360]  the electrochemical plate structure in the battery without additives, increasing capacity
[3:22:31.360 --> 3:22:33.600]  and maintaining cell integrity.
[3:22:33.600 --> 3:22:37.040]  Renaissance Charger offers a full line of products made in the USA for all types and
[3:22:37.040 --> 3:22:38.680]  sizes of batteries.
[3:22:38.680 --> 3:22:43.240]  Find out why our customers tell us the Renaissance Charger is the only battery charger they will
[3:22:43.240 --> 3:22:44.240]  ever use.

[3:23:01.560 --> 3:23:06.640]  Hi it's MZ wondering how many of us Alex Jones fans intend to take the swine flu vaccine.
[3:23:06.640 --> 3:23:10.320]  I'm not, don't trust it, but then I don't want to get the disease either.
[3:23:10.320 --> 3:23:16.320]  So I use PureWorks, a unique disinfectant that comes in foam or spray form.
[3:23:16.320 --> 3:23:18.640]  PureWorks is not your typical hand disinfectant.
[3:23:18.640 --> 3:23:23.160]  There is no alcohol to dry your skin and it lasts for hours not minutes.
[3:23:23.160 --> 3:23:26.320]  Use PureWorks to protect yourself from disease and infection.
[3:23:26.320 --> 3:23:34.480]  You can find out all about it and order it online at nogerms.info, that's nogerms.info.
[3:23:34.480 --> 3:23:39.360]  Don't introduce potentially dangerous chemicals or toxins into your body to keep you well
[3:23:39.360 --> 3:23:43.040]  when they could actually cause the sickness you want to avoid.
[3:23:43.040 --> 3:23:48.800]  Don't pick your nose, don't shake hands and don't handle banisters, rails and doorknobs.
[3:23:48.800 --> 3:23:53.920]  Do try PureWorks, available online at wholesale pricing to Alex Jones listeners.
[3:23:53.920 --> 3:23:57.880]  Go to nogerms.info, that's nogerms.info.
[3:23:57.880 --> 3:24:00.400]  Be well and stay well, best MZ.
[3:24:00.400 --> 3:24:13.920]  All right, newsboard's coming up.
[3:24:13.920 --> 3:24:18.160]  I will go to a ton of news here at the end of the transmission.
[3:24:18.160 --> 3:24:20.160]  Let's go to Hunter and Anglin first though.
[3:24:20.160 --> 3:24:21.160]  Hunter, you're on the air.
[3:24:21.160 --> 3:24:22.160]  Thanks for holding.
[3:24:22.160 --> 3:24:23.160]  Yes, Alex.
[3:24:23.160 --> 3:24:26.680]  I'm a new listener.
[3:24:26.680 --> 3:24:32.360]  I was back home on leave probably six months ago and my brother was burning a whole bunch
[3:24:32.360 --> 3:24:38.400]  of copies of the Obama deception to take to a gun show down in Salt Lake and so I watched
[3:24:38.400 --> 3:24:41.760]  it and a lot of it just made common sense.
[3:24:41.760 --> 3:24:45.680]  Everything that you said, you said don't just take my word for it, research it yourself
[3:24:45.680 --> 3:24:46.680]  so that's what I do.
[3:24:46.680 --> 3:24:52.480]  But I just had a couple of statements with Obama's program to increase school throughout
[3:24:52.480 --> 3:24:55.120]  the year and the length of the school days.
[3:24:55.120 --> 3:24:59.360]  The United States, I'm in the Air Force, the United States Air Force decided instead of
[3:24:59.360 --> 3:25:04.000]  giving the people an hour and a half, three days a week during duty hours to work out
[3:25:04.000 --> 3:25:09.720]  for their PT test, they now decided as of January 1st that that will be done on your
[3:25:09.720 --> 3:25:11.720]  own time and not during work hours.
[3:25:11.720 --> 3:25:14.440]  I want to point out that Americans aren't lazy.
[3:25:14.440 --> 3:25:19.360]  We work more hours than anybody in the world, that's a statistic you can pull up.
[3:25:19.360 --> 3:25:22.640]  We have less vacation, everything, they are forcing us.
[3:25:22.640 --> 3:25:26.360]  First they make the women go work, now they take your kids away.
[3:25:26.360 --> 3:25:30.640]  Also we could pay taxes to the bankers to fund their empire.
[3:25:30.640 --> 3:25:37.160]  And another thing, since I am a new listener, I do get into some conversation with people
[3:25:37.160 --> 3:25:44.240]  at my work and there was an NCL in my shop today, he's like oh, there was another theorist
[3:25:44.240 --> 3:25:49.720]  in his Texel school class, he was cross training to this career field.
[3:25:49.720 --> 3:25:55.920]  He said this person who worked the flight line at Lingley Air Force Base on 9-11 was
[3:25:55.920 --> 3:26:01.440]  telling people in the class that one of the, an F-15 that came back was missing one of
[3:26:01.440 --> 3:26:02.440]  the missiles.
[3:26:02.440 --> 3:26:07.440]  And everyone was making fun of the, he said everyone was making fun of them calling them
[3:26:07.440 --> 3:26:09.800]  nuts and crazy and things like that.
[3:26:09.800 --> 3:26:14.800]  Even though we've got generals that have gone public and other people and witnesses and
[3:26:14.800 --> 3:26:22.700]  what the state police said they saw in Pennsylvania, that two AIM-9s or these air-to-air missiles
[3:26:22.700 --> 3:26:29.160]  were fired into Flight 93.
[3:26:29.160 --> 3:26:35.640]  And my brother has your subscription to the prison planet, I'm going to burn the video,
[3:26:35.640 --> 3:26:39.480]  I have some couple friends here in England, we're going to go to the houses and flip
[3:26:39.480 --> 3:26:43.760]  them through the mailbox and try and get as much as out there as possible because you
[3:26:43.760 --> 3:26:47.480]  know it is very important that people know this and hopefully you know we're not too
[3:26:47.480 --> 3:26:51.760]  late and I appreciate your time.
[3:26:51.760 --> 3:26:56.520]  Well awesome, awesome my friend, I mean the explosive power of the people taking action,
[3:26:56.520 --> 3:27:01.240]  we have a criminal foreign banking takeover happening and the people are standing up and
[3:27:01.240 --> 3:27:05.480]  saying no and this film chronicles who the criminals are, what their master plan is,
[3:27:05.480 --> 3:27:06.480]  how to stop them.
[3:27:06.480 --> 3:27:10.480]  That's why Fall of the Republic is so important, it is up to you the listeners how big this
[3:27:10.480 --> 3:27:11.480]  film gets.
[3:27:11.480 --> 3:27:15.680]  I make it, I put it out there, it is a weapon, use it.
[3:27:15.680 --> 3:27:20.640]  Thank you so much, good to hear from you Hunter, an American in the Air Force in England.
[3:27:20.640 --> 3:27:23.360]  Ted in Delaware, Ted you're on the air, welcome.
[3:27:23.360 --> 3:27:25.280]  Hey Alex, how you doing?
[3:27:25.280 --> 3:27:26.280]  Good.
[3:27:26.280 --> 3:27:31.960]  Hey, I got a relatively quick, I'm what you would call a noob in this, I've recently
[3:27:31.960 --> 3:27:35.960]  been a noob for maybe a year, you know I knew something was wrong, I was staring at the
[3:27:35.960 --> 3:27:38.240]  pool and you pushed me in.
[3:27:38.240 --> 3:27:45.800]  But now I sort of feel like, I need a little bit more than the DVDs, I don't have the information
[3:27:45.800 --> 3:27:54.640]  like you do 10 years of researching, so I can't really express to people, you know face-to-face,
[3:27:54.640 --> 3:28:01.560]  I would like to maybe get a poetic sort of letter to the police and the military, something
[3:28:01.560 --> 3:28:06.320]  we could print out in mass, just the people, the people, the new people like me that can
[3:28:06.320 --> 3:28:12.040]  really get out there and get out to these people, maybe a letter, just somewhat poetic,
[3:28:12.040 --> 3:28:16.400]  somewhat facts, you know small that we can all print out and hand to people.
[3:28:16.400 --> 3:28:22.120]  Okay, Pat Buchanan, for World That Daily, it's syndicated all over the place but World
[3:28:22.120 --> 3:28:31.200]  Had an incredible article about Oathkeepers to the military today, Jack McClam's Vampire
[3:28:31.200 --> 3:28:37.400]  Killer 2000, a letter to the police and military written back in the mid-90s, the police read
[3:28:37.400 --> 3:28:44.000]  it, it's like revelation, it came true, Vampire Killer 2000, it's everywhere, my police state
[3:28:44.000 --> 3:28:49.920]  films, listeners are welcome to write up their own idea of a message to the police and military,
[3:28:49.920 --> 3:28:55.120]  we should reach out to them, they are waking up and send it to writersandinfowars.com, we'll
[3:28:55.120 --> 3:29:01.080]  post it, let me be clear, I don't have all the energy to even produce all the answers
[3:29:01.080 --> 3:29:05.860]  I know, I talk about it here on the show, all we talk about is solutions, solutions
[3:29:05.860 --> 3:29:11.840]  is identifying the criminal bankers and bringing them to justice, that's number one, and not
[3:29:11.840 --> 3:29:16.000]  paying this national debt to these foreign banks, arresting these crooks, we've given
[3:29:16.000 --> 3:29:19.400]  them tens of trillions of our own money, we've got to point out it's fraud, I mean what
[3:29:19.400 --> 3:29:24.320]  if we just let Madoff keep running Ponzi schemes and if he put a gold crown on and announced
[3:29:24.320 --> 3:29:29.720]  he was God, well we have to follow him, no, he's a fraud, it's like what was the solution
[3:29:29.720 --> 3:29:34.080]  to ending slavery in this country, black people started revolting and white people started
[3:29:34.080 --> 3:29:37.960]  revolting against it, and they said this is inhuman and wrong and evil, and they were
[3:29:37.960 --> 3:29:44.160]  called kooky minorities in 1800, but 60 something years later it was illegal, you know black
[3:29:44.160 --> 3:29:49.160]  people 60 years ago, 50 years ago couldn't eat in white restaurants, now they can, you
[3:29:49.160 --> 3:29:56.280]  just say I'm not your slave, we're on the march, the empire's on the run, Alex Jones
[3:29:56.280 --> 3:30:03.680]  and the GCN radio network, this is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider
[3:30:03.680 --> 3:30:08.440]  buying a solar power generator, number one, new climate legislation could easily double
[3:30:08.440 --> 3:30:12.800]  or triple your electric bill, number two, our new energies are wants to control how
[3:30:12.800 --> 3:30:17.520]  much power your electric company allows you to have, it's true, total government control
[3:30:17.520 --> 3:30:22.360]  of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming, number three, in some
[3:30:22.360 --> 3:30:27.880]  areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded, and now new socialist legislation
[3:30:27.880 --> 3:30:32.320]  is only compounding the problem, number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local
[3:30:32.320 --> 3:30:37.000]  grids, every year thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages, number
[3:30:37.000 --> 3:30:41.920]  five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind, folks
[3:30:41.920 --> 3:30:45.560]  I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of
[3:30:45.560 --> 3:30:52.760]  my oldest sponsors, you can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com, that's mysolarbackup.com,

[3:31:03.200 --> 3:31:07.720]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone, this is our last
[3:31:07.720 --> 3:31:12.960]  chance to not relive history, is it finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the
[3:31:12.960 --> 3:31:18.040]  rug from underneath the Americans at home, I have tremendous influence on our president
[3:31:18.040 --> 3:31:23.280]  in Congress and they really are calling the shots, I think it's incumbent upon all of
[3:31:23.280 --> 3:31:28.760]  us as American citizens to pay attention, full of the republic identifies the enemies
[3:31:28.760 --> 3:31:34.320]  of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty and on
[3:31:34.320 --> 3:31:38.960]  its ashes constructing world government, Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists, they're
[3:31:38.960 --> 3:31:43.120]  asking for more matches and the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[3:31:43.120 --> 3:31:48.960]  Today seems like nobody does care, and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall
[3:31:48.960 --> 3:31:50.320]  of the republic.

[3:32:15.400 --> 3:32:20.200]  combined, and money will soon be more valuable as toilet paper due to the nation's 12 trillion
[3:32:20.200 --> 3:32:24.520]  dollar debt which is why gold is now over a thousand dollars an ounce, according to the

[3:33:59.760 --> 3:34:10.880]  Richard Belzer, I blink Belzer. Yeah, I saw this like a week ago. We posted it up on info wars.com
[3:34:10.880 --> 3:34:17.040]  and prison planet.com. And then I keep forgetting to play it. And I wanted to play it just to
[3:34:17.040 --> 3:34:22.480]  illustrate he's a pretty big actor, a big comedian. And he goes on Bill Maher and brings up how the
[3:34:22.480 --> 3:34:28.240]  fellow reserves the real government runs it all. And a lot of people have known this, but now the
[3:34:28.240 --> 3:34:33.360]  majority know it the vast majority in every major poll and are angry and want to audit it and want
[3:34:33.360 --> 3:34:38.560]  to abolish it. It is the real government. And we are on the path towards bringing these people to
[3:34:38.560 --> 3:34:44.240]  justice. I want to play this clip and then we're going to do a news blitz and then take a bunch
[3:34:44.240 --> 3:34:49.200]  of other calls from Ray, Jim, Chris and others. But here he is on Bill Maher and Bill Maher just
[3:34:49.200 --> 3:34:53.520]  makes jokes about this, even though Kennedy did sign an executive order to start abolishing the
[3:34:53.520 --> 3:34:58.800]  fellow reserve, even though this is the true shadow government, even though the Federal Reserve is
[3:34:58.800 --> 3:35:06.400]  private. Bill Maher knows that, so he doesn't joke about that. The truth is coming out any way
[3:35:06.400 --> 3:35:14.000]  you slice it or dice it. But here is the clip. Quickly, in 1910, Senator Aldrich on his private
[3:35:14.000 --> 3:35:18.960]  train brought a bunch of billionaire bankers, the Morgans, all these different people of
[3:35:18.960 --> 3:35:24.400]  Warburgs down to this place called Jekyll Island off the coast of Georgia. And they figured out
[3:35:24.400 --> 3:35:29.520]  a way to create the Federal Reserve because central banks were looked down upon by the people
[3:35:29.520 --> 3:35:34.000]  and they caused a lot of problems. By creating the Federal Reserve, they convinced the Congress
[3:35:34.000 --> 3:35:38.640]  and the people that the Federal Reserve is a government arm. It's not. They borrow money
[3:35:38.640 --> 3:35:46.080]  from private banks. We're owned by banks and you can't alter that. John Kennedy wanted to
[3:35:46.080 --> 3:35:51.040]  stop borrowing and wanted to stop using the Federal Reserve, use silver certificates to
[3:35:51.040 --> 3:35:56.800]  determine the value of the dollar, and print money through the Treasury. So they exploded his head.
[3:35:56.800 --> 3:36:02.480]  The point is... Well, that's quite a connection you make. Yeah. Well, let's forget the Kennedy
[3:36:02.480 --> 3:36:06.400]  part. He did want to do that. He did want to buy the Federal... Isn't it the Federal Reserve?
[3:36:06.400 --> 3:36:09.840]  I've heard a lot of reasons why he gets shot. I never heard of that. Well, that's the reason.
[3:36:09.840 --> 3:36:15.360]  And that's the scam. It's not billions of dollars that banks control. It's trillions. You don't
[3:36:15.360 --> 3:36:20.080]  mess with the banks. And the Senate at Urban said this place is owned by the banks on the
[3:36:20.080 --> 3:36:26.080]  floor of the Senate. Federal Reserve has been rapidly increasing the rate at which it's printing
[3:36:26.080 --> 3:36:31.120]  dollars. In fact, it took 200 years for the money... That's good. And the folks at Federal
[3:36:31.120 --> 3:36:35.280]  Jack added some of their own comments on that video. I want to do a news blitz and then,
[3:36:35.280 --> 3:36:40.320]  as I said, end the show with your calls today. But before I do that, I also want this hour,
[3:36:40.320 --> 3:36:44.960]  I want to tell you about a few of the sponsors that have made today's radio show possible
[3:36:44.960 --> 3:36:50.000]  and the rebroadcast is coming up with David Ray Griffin and, of course, Lindsey Williams.
[3:36:50.000 --> 3:36:55.360]  So you don't want to miss that on this Tuesday, October 20th, 2009 edition.
[3:36:57.120 --> 3:37:01.680]  MySolarBackup.com. A lot of things can cut off your electrical power, hurricanes, snow,
[3:37:01.680 --> 3:37:04.720]  and ice storms. Listeners should move towards getting off the grid. And here's a good way to
[3:37:04.720 --> 3:37:10.240]  do just that. A solar power generator is now available from our longtime sponsor. We're getting
[3:37:10.240 --> 3:37:16.400]  reviews from listeners. They love it. Solutions from science. You get an emergency power backup
[3:37:16.400 --> 3:37:23.600]  kit, which consists of the power source 1800-1800 watt generator and a high efficiency solar panel
[3:37:23.600 --> 3:37:26.960]  designed to provide endless electricity. Remember, too, that gas generators need gas,
[3:37:26.960 --> 3:37:30.720]  but in the blackout, gas pumps can't pump gas because they run on electricity.
[3:37:31.760 --> 3:37:35.920]  It's the perfect emergency backup for troubled times. The government doesn't own
[3:37:35.920 --> 3:37:44.160]  the sun yet, so make your move. Now go to one word, www.MySolarBackup.com. That's MySolarBackup.com
[3:37:44.160 --> 3:37:53.680]  or give them a call at 877-327-0365. That's 877-327-0365. And in closing, and then on to the news blitz,
[3:37:54.240 --> 3:38:00.320]  from the same great folks at Solutions from Science, survivalseedbank.com. In a real crisis,
[3:38:00.320 --> 3:38:04.960]  having non-hybrid seeds means having the ability to grow an endless supply of nutrient-dense food
[3:38:04.960 --> 3:38:09.360]  to feed your loved ones. There have been many times in American history, pilgrims, for example,
[3:38:09.360 --> 3:38:14.560]  when seeds have the highest value of any barter item. There's a war on against non-hybrid seeds
[3:38:14.560 --> 3:38:18.880]  waged by the global elite who want to control us by controlling the food supply, plus gardening's
[3:38:18.880 --> 3:38:26.000]  fun, folks, especially healthy, non-GMO organic seeds. Governments are storing seeds. The UN
[3:38:26.000 --> 3:38:29.600]  is storing seeds. Globals of every stripe are storing seeds. They're the Arctic Circle. Why
[3:38:29.600 --> 3:38:34.480]  do you think this is? You know why. Control and power. Solutions from Science is trying to get
[3:38:34.480 --> 3:38:38.240]  seeds out of the globalist hands and into the hands of the people, one seed bank at a time,
[3:38:38.240 --> 3:38:42.720]  one family at a time. A survivalseedbank from Solutions from Science contains enough open
[3:38:42.720 --> 3:38:48.640]  pollinated seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden. Seeds in the survivalseedbank are hand
[3:38:48.640 --> 3:38:53.840]  picked for exceptional germination rates. Order a couple of seed banks today while you still can.
[3:38:53.840 --> 3:39:05.600]  Go to survivalseedbank.com or 877-327-0365. That's 877-327-0365. Survivalseedbank.com.
[3:39:05.680 --> 3:39:10.160]  Okay. Let me just news blitz some of the news I have here. You know they've come out and announced
[3:39:10.160 --> 3:39:15.440]  what we've known for over a decade, that the Pentagon and the Department of Energy and the
[3:39:15.440 --> 3:39:20.080]  Department of Commerce and the Department of Education and Department of Labor and all these
[3:39:20.080 --> 3:39:29.120]  federal departments have multi-billion dollar budgets a year. A piece to go out and pay for the
[3:39:29.120 --> 3:39:38.160]  scripts to be written in dramas, sitcoms, TV shows, game shows, children's shows especially.
[3:39:38.160 --> 3:39:43.120]  I mean when I watch children's cartoons a couple times a year randomly, I'll usually be on vacation,
[3:39:43.120 --> 3:39:48.400]  turn the TV on, just to let my kids watch some TV every once in a while and it's like,
[3:39:48.400 --> 3:39:53.040]  oh the earth is bad, there's too many people, the UN's going to save us, the UN fights off
[3:39:53.040 --> 3:39:59.280]  the aliens, parents are bad, microchips in your body, you're good, the government knows best
[3:40:00.480 --> 3:40:04.320]  and they've got a list of these. Well here it is, CIA to monitor internet chatter for
[3:40:04.320 --> 3:40:11.120]  anti-government sentiment. The CIA admits in Wired magazine and a bunch of other places that they
[3:40:11.120 --> 3:40:16.400]  are going to track the American people and the Pentagon is countering the American people with
[3:40:16.400 --> 3:40:22.480]  blogs and operatives and hired think tanks and hired PR firms and that's who's out attacking us
[3:40:22.480 --> 3:40:26.800]  on Info Wars and Prison Planet and YouTube. I mean they don't even hide it. They have a weird
[3:40:26.800 --> 3:40:32.400]  Wikipedia group who give themselves brigade awards and they actually get teenagers to help them and
[3:40:32.400 --> 3:40:37.040]  they go, yeah I'm special ops, black ops, fighting the evil Alex Jones, that son of a
[3:40:37.040 --> 3:40:43.280]  bitch is a traitor and they're all proud of themselves putting out propaganda and demonizing
[3:40:43.280 --> 3:40:50.240]  Ron Paul. I mean it's real folks and it's going on everywhere so that article is important.
[3:40:50.960 --> 3:40:56.080]  The scientists who work for government accused of spying, it looks like on the FBI affidavit,
[3:40:56.080 --> 3:41:02.880]  they've got him recorded asking for petty sums. I mean turns out he worked for an Israeli company,
[3:41:02.880 --> 3:41:07.840]  they already suspected him of spying, he worked in space space weapons, space vehicles, spy
[3:41:07.840 --> 3:41:16.480]  satellites, this is a master scientist. For 10,000 bucks he gave them data cards, he gave them memory
[3:41:16.480 --> 3:41:26.240]  sticks, USB drives, the little sticks, it says in the affidavit, with total satellite data information,
[3:41:26.240 --> 3:41:30.880]  what they're doing, how they're doing it, nuclear weapons systems, he wanted to give them for
[3:41:30.880 --> 3:41:38.080]  $10,000 and it looks bad with these Israeli companies, one of them it says, paid him 200
[3:41:38.080 --> 3:41:43.840]  something here is $225,000 for one Israeli company he worked for. Now they haven't proven yet that
[3:41:43.840 --> 3:41:49.040]  that's a front but most big Israeli companies are, but the point is this guy would sell out
[3:41:51.120 --> 3:41:54.640]  but see he's low level, he's a high level scientist but low level compared to Sandy
[3:41:54.640 --> 3:42:01.760]  Berger stealing the highest level NSA intercepts out of Congress. In the bubble room, they've got
[3:42:01.760 --> 3:42:06.160]  a room where intelligence committee people can see documents and it was incriminating stuff on
[3:42:06.160 --> 3:42:12.720]  Clinton so he stuck it in his pants and his sock, he didn't get in trouble and as bad as that is
[3:42:12.720 --> 3:42:17.920]  to steal incriminating information, I read the affidavit, I scanned over the articles, I spent
[3:42:17.920 --> 3:42:23.840]  about 30 minutes on this and this guy looks as guilty as sin, it's kind of encouraging that the FBI
[3:42:23.840 --> 3:42:31.040]  would actually bust a criminal but at the same time, if they are setting him up, it's the biggest
[3:42:31.040 --> 3:42:40.080]  setup I've ever seen because they have video, they have recordings, they had meetings in hotel rooms
[3:42:40.080 --> 3:42:45.920]  and for $9,000, I said 10, he asked for 10, he got nine for some reason, he gave him, oh here's
[3:42:45.920 --> 3:42:50.640]  a bunch of satellite data worth tens of billions of dollars potentially and he was like, I'll give
[3:42:50.640 --> 3:42:58.800]  you all the nukes secrets because he worked on nukes as well. I mean this is insane and my question
[3:42:58.800 --> 3:43:04.640]  is if Israel's been caught spying on us more than even the Russians, why is Israel allowed to run the
[3:43:04.640 --> 3:43:14.880]  one company that controls over 95% of all telephone routing and caller ID systems in the country?
[3:43:14.880 --> 3:43:19.680]  Why does Israel have a company that's government controlled that guards most of the US nuclear
[3:43:19.680 --> 3:43:25.120]  weapons stockpile? I mean my whole issue is Israel's always in fighting with themselves
[3:43:25.120 --> 3:43:29.600]  and killing each other in government and all that, subterfuge, our government is a joke,
[3:43:29.600 --> 3:43:36.240]  ladies and gentlemen. I thought I would just mention that. So many threats to federal officials
[3:43:36.240 --> 3:43:41.440]  that secret service maker tail investigations into financial crimes, this is from the Boston Globe
[3:43:41.440 --> 3:43:53.520]  reposted at cryptong.com but there's the Boston Globe and I remember scores of articles. I mean
[3:43:53.520 --> 3:43:58.400]  literally, I can't keep track, I could say 50, 100, I don't know, I've probably seen 50 of us,
[3:43:58.400 --> 3:44:03.440]  probably more, articles the last three or four years. We could search engine this right now in
[3:44:03.440 --> 3:44:14.560]  fact. FBI cuts number of white collar fraud investigators. Try searching that. If you're a
[3:44:14.560 --> 3:44:18.560]  multi-millionaire or a billionaire, there are almost no investigators for you. They've cut
[3:44:18.560 --> 3:44:23.280]  them down to nothing and they put the investigators not on middle class people making 100 grand a year.
[3:44:24.400 --> 3:44:30.880]  They put the fraud investigators on blue collar. People making $20,000 a year.
[3:44:30.880 --> 3:44:39.280]  Hard work. I mean, because again, crooks run the system and now they're going to cut it again.
[3:44:39.280 --> 3:44:44.480]  Just like more than half of Congress, it's come out, doesn't pay taxes and then doesn't get in
[3:44:44.480 --> 3:44:48.640]  trouble. Just like the Treasury Secretary doesn't pay them and doesn't get in trouble.
[3:44:48.640 --> 3:45:02.480]  FBI cuts white collar crime force. Yeah, click on that and then that's a blog and then it'll
[3:45:02.480 --> 3:45:10.720]  have a link to the actual article. But what was the source on that? Point is it's all over
[3:45:10.720 --> 3:45:15.280]  mainstream news that that's going on. I mean, here's Boston Globe, the unprecedented number of
[3:45:15.280 --> 3:45:20.080]  death threats against President Obama, a rise in racist hate groups, and a new wave of anti-government
[3:45:20.080 --> 3:45:22.960]  fur were threatened to overwhelm the U.S. Secret Service according to government officials and
[3:45:22.960 --> 3:45:29.040]  reports, raising new questions about a 144-year-old agency overall mission. And then it goes on to
[3:45:29.040 --> 3:45:33.840]  say the Secret Service is basically going to stop investigating all different types of white collar
[3:45:33.840 --> 3:45:39.280]  crime. And I mean, it's the same across the board. They've always got excuses. We are worried about
[3:45:39.280 --> 3:45:44.880]  weak dollar Euro group chief says 16 countries that use the Euro single currency are worried
[3:45:44.880 --> 3:45:48.400]  by the weakness of the dollar on currency markets. The head of the Euro group said Monday,
[3:45:48.400 --> 3:45:52.160]  they may do what they did a couple years ago and go in and buy dollars trying to prop it up,
[3:45:52.160 --> 3:45:59.440]  but it's only putting off the inevitable fraud inquiry slashes cars. I vote to 48% setting
[3:45:59.440 --> 3:46:05.920]  stage for runoff. This Unicol executive, this, this fraud, we told you when they had the election,
[3:46:06.560 --> 3:46:11.840]  I was at six months ago, I forget that it was a complete fraud. And now they've had to admit
[3:46:11.840 --> 3:46:16.800]  it's a fraud. But see in America, we can't admit that many elections are frauds, even though they've
[3:46:16.800 --> 3:46:22.480]  been caught because they'll give you an Obama after eight years of clear fraud. People go,
[3:46:22.480 --> 3:46:26.480]  Oh, well, then Democrats can get elected. There must not be fraud. But now that they're in power,
[3:46:26.480 --> 3:46:30.320]  Republicans aren't going to be able to get elected. It's all stage. Ladies and gentlemen,
[3:46:30.320 --> 3:46:39.040]  they put in the establishment candidates. Senator Hagel owns the electronic voting machines
[3:46:39.040 --> 3:46:43.040]  that over 80% of his ballots were cast for in Nebraska. I mean, these guys,
[3:46:43.680 --> 3:46:47.840]  he owned the company before it came to center. The polls said he was going to lose by 14 to 16
[3:46:47.840 --> 3:46:53.200]  points, spending on the poll. He said, I'm going to win one by over 14. That's a 30 point swing
[3:46:53.200 --> 3:46:59.760]  almost. Polls never did that before. 99% of us don't want naft and gadget continues.
[3:47:01.280 --> 3:47:06.640]  80 plus percent don't want open borders. It continues. 99% don't want the beggar bail out.
[3:47:06.640 --> 3:47:12.560]  It continues because the government is rogue and criminal. And these bankers are going to steal
[3:47:12.560 --> 3:47:17.120]  everything and leave us with a police state to protect their exit with the money if we don't
[3:47:17.120 --> 3:47:22.320]  stand up against them. And they're going to use the carbon tax to shake all the money out of our
[3:47:22.320 --> 3:47:28.160]  pockets. Speaking of that, I mentioned this yesterday. I've never got to it. Here is Reuters.
[3:47:28.160 --> 3:47:38.720]  And they say in this article, and they do this as a stunt that, that they may not allow
[3:47:40.960 --> 3:47:47.520]  there to be a world cup in South Africa because of the carbon footprint, the evil carbon dioxide
[3:47:47.520 --> 3:47:53.120]  that plants breathe that are put out by the jets. And it says in the article that they're looking
[3:47:53.120 --> 3:47:56.160]  at what they're going to have to do, or maybe they'll just put a tax. The first thing they say,
[3:47:56.160 --> 3:48:00.400]  oh, we may cancel it. Everybody gets scared. They just put a big tax on it. Now I have another
[3:48:00.400 --> 3:48:05.600]  article here in my stack where Schwarzenegger has to sign a waiver bill for carbon footprint
[3:48:05.600 --> 3:48:14.960]  just to allow a new NFL stadium. He's banning TV sets over 40 inches. Forget just the tax
[3:48:14.960 --> 3:48:19.600]  saying they use too much energy. They're setting the precedent to micromanage your lives. They've
[3:48:19.600 --> 3:48:25.520]  already banned almost all over Europe, uh, space eaters, those outdoor propane or butane space
[3:48:25.520 --> 3:48:29.280]  eaters that work so great. You see it outdoor restaurants. They're banning them. They're
[3:48:29.280 --> 3:48:34.000]  banning fireplaces. Don't believe me. California is looking at it. Google it for folks right now.
[3:48:35.520 --> 3:48:41.600]  Europe, Europe, some European nations ban space eaters. You'll see BBC and they report it like
[3:48:41.600 --> 3:48:46.880]  it's good carbon emissions from next year's soccer world cup are expected to soar from 2006
[3:48:46.880 --> 3:48:51.600]  benchmarks sent by Germany host nation in South Africa said Monday, harmful emissions accelerate
[3:48:51.600 --> 3:48:56.400]  global warming and major sports events total made up. Humans are exhaling this, including
[3:48:56.400 --> 3:49:01.440]  Olympic and World Cup tournaments. The F I F A 2000 a cup will be the largest carbon footprint of
[3:49:01.440 --> 3:49:06.560]  any major event with the goal to be climate neutral. South Africa's water environment resource
[3:49:06.560 --> 3:49:12.880]  minister said she said the estimate carbon footprint of Africa's first soccer cup is
[3:49:12.880 --> 3:49:19.440]  896,000 tons of carbon dioxide. Oh, how deadly the plants will breathe it air travel to visits
[3:49:19.440 --> 3:49:23.120]  and long haul destinations expected to make 67% of the country's total carbon emissions
[3:49:23.120 --> 3:49:27.440]  during that one month event next year. This footprint is almost 10 times the footprint
[3:49:27.440 --> 3:49:32.000]  of the cup in Germany, adding that Germany did not include air travel in its carbon footprint.
[3:49:32.000 --> 3:49:35.760]  Then you go on to some other articles I have on it where they mentioned what there it is EU
[3:49:35.760 --> 3:49:40.400]  threatens to ban patio eaters. If you pull it up, they already did it. That's an article from a
[3:49:40.400 --> 3:49:44.960]  year over a year and a half ago. That's times of London right there. I mean, I mean this hit in
[3:49:44.960 --> 3:49:52.080]  the game. Where's my Schwarzenegger? Here's my Schwarzenegger LA times Los Angeles. Are you
[3:49:52.080 --> 3:50:00.480]  ready for some NFL football? Where's where is Hank Williams, Jr.? Are you ready for some football?
[3:50:00.480 --> 3:50:06.880]  Yeah. Governor Schwarzenegger wants some football and jobs. Governor Schwarzenegger said he's going
[3:50:06.880 --> 3:50:10.880]  to sign an environmental exemption bill that will clear the way for construction of the LA
[3:50:10.880 --> 3:50:18.720]  stadium and its large carbon footprint. Oh, see all this means is they get to build. In Austin,
[3:50:18.720 --> 3:50:24.560]  they stole tens of thousands of acres under SOS saying it'd be parkland. They took it all, gave it
[3:50:24.560 --> 3:50:29.360]  to the local swindlers, gave it to the big environmental bodies, the banks, and then turned
[3:50:29.360 --> 3:50:37.520]  around and built all over it. This is how they roll. Turns out the federal government AP's reporting
[3:50:37.520 --> 3:50:42.880]  is paying off doctors to support Obama. He goes out these events and hands them white lab coats.
[3:50:43.440 --> 3:50:45.680]  He asked them to put it on to look official. That's confirmed.
[3:50:48.480 --> 3:50:51.840]  Cities and counties are having to shut down and lay off workers everywhere. It's only going to get
