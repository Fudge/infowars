[00:00.000 --> 00:02.000]  We've got it.
[00:07.380 --> 00:09.380]  Waging war on corruption
[00:11.420 --> 00:17.460]  It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the info war
[00:23.820 --> 00:26.580]  Welcome my friends welcome and thank you for joining us
[00:26.580 --> 00:31.360]  It's a big day for the world not just America the hog wallops
[00:32.000 --> 00:38.620]  Are playing the Kebler elves in the greatest game on earth what they call?
[00:39.840 --> 00:43.760]  Acorn skipping right now and the entire planet's future
[00:44.960 --> 00:47.320]  Basically depends on this football game
[00:49.160 --> 00:51.720]  Of course, I'm being sarcastic I
[00:51.720 --> 00:55.800]  Don't write this stuff. It just comes up off the top of my head
[00:56.640 --> 01:00.600]  It is Super Bowl Sunday the big game
[01:01.360 --> 01:03.360]  endless hype
[01:03.920 --> 01:08.000]  Children are taught this is Americana. This is what you value
[01:08.640 --> 01:13.480]  Not your health not your family not your culture because you don't have a culture
[01:14.080 --> 01:16.080]  It's a plastic
[01:16.080 --> 01:20.880]  Global corporate culture that's force fed to you that promotes torture
[01:21.400 --> 01:23.640]  Secret war record cancer rates
[01:24.240 --> 01:25.840]  Families broken up
[01:25.840 --> 01:31.120]  Giant prisons biggest in the world and a government that's publicly shipping the narcotics into the nation
[01:31.880 --> 01:33.880]  all of it wrapped in a
[01:34.720 --> 01:36.720]  American flag but
[01:39.000 --> 01:43.760]  I'm gonna have to do a special newscast on this in the future a little review
[01:43.760 --> 01:50.200]  every action-adventure movie I watched is supposedly set in our contemporary world as
[01:52.360 --> 01:55.840]  Pro checkpoint police state New World Order
[01:57.360 --> 02:02.120]  Images throughout it and you see the shows like Breaking Bad on TV where
[02:02.720 --> 02:09.700]  Ron Paul, you know the methhead is a fan of Ron Paul all of that is propaganda, but the fact that it's so
[02:09.700 --> 02:15.780]  Complete and so across the board is really just more evidence of
[02:17.260 --> 02:22.180]  Just how criminal this system is I watched law-abiding citizen earlier in the week
[02:23.140 --> 02:24.340]  reviewed it
[02:24.340 --> 02:30.540]  Well on the treadmill and the whole thing is get rid of the Bill of Rights Constitution have checkpoints torture people
[02:30.540 --> 02:36.380]  It's what the good guys do and the prosecutor at the end agrees. It's good to torture and have no liberties or freedom
[02:36.380 --> 02:42.940]  This movie source code the guy that's gonna detonate a homemade atomic bomb in Chicago
[02:43.620 --> 02:46.500]  Which I've says me the next globalist target. It's one of the big ones
[02:47.140 --> 02:49.780]  I've seen their preconditioning propaganda for it
[02:50.220 --> 02:57.780]  The bad guy builds the bomb with an American flag on it. So see it's the image of people that are in the American flag
[02:57.780 --> 03:05.660]  Separately from when it's government approved you're terrorist and he's he's a right-wing scum anti-government
[03:06.220 --> 03:09.260]  And he wants to nuke everything
[03:10.220 --> 03:13.500]  But don't worry that the helicopter pilot
[03:14.220 --> 03:20.900]  Who's really dead in a vegetative state, but that they've revived his brain to send him into the hyperdimensional
[03:20.900 --> 03:28.420]  Vortex to go back and save everyone and oh, it's just so magical. Oh, it's so wonderful
[03:29.140 --> 03:32.660]  So they just make fake military heroes that you know
[03:32.660 --> 03:37.900]  They've learned not to use a pat Tillman because he could get out of hand or a private lynch and then they have to kill people
[03:38.660 --> 03:43.060]  No, they just always have the hero the torturer who's military
[03:43.940 --> 03:48.300]  The good guy that knows the Bill of Rights is bad and the cops all agree and
[03:48.300 --> 03:53.980]  You know learn that and of course this guy he stops the ever-present bombers
[03:55.060 --> 03:59.420]  You know, we've gone over the statistics, but I thought I'd go back into some of those later in the transmission
[03:59.980 --> 04:01.980]  you got a better chance of
[04:04.020 --> 04:06.020]  Dying in the water drowned
[04:07.580 --> 04:13.940]  You've got a better chance dying from honeybee stings or a deer jumping out in front of your car or
[04:13.940 --> 04:18.660]  From champagne corks, and I have the CDC's on numbers here
[04:19.260 --> 04:21.260]  then you do of
[04:22.220 --> 04:25.740]  Dying from terrorists, but every TV show movie
[04:26.540 --> 04:29.200]  Everything is about terrorists are under every
[04:31.220 --> 04:36.880]  Table and you're just supposed to shake and fear and trust no one but the government
[04:37.380 --> 04:41.820]  And that brings me to the big top story that ended up being all over national news
[04:41.820 --> 04:44.580]  The Paul Watson put out Friday
[04:45.580 --> 04:53.500]  TSA trained Super Bowl hot dog sellers spot terrorist Fox News picked it up TSA deploys wiener watchers at the Super Bowl
[04:53.500 --> 04:56.660]  We're gonna break it all down straight ahead and I ran. We'll be back
[04:59.700 --> 05:01.500]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones
[05:01.500 --> 05:04.620]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings

[05:23.100 --> 05:29.900]  perfumes deodorants or antibacterials your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes
[05:29.900 --> 05:36.920]  itching sores and deteriorating clothing called lint if you want something better if you want something you've never had before you

[06:07.300 --> 06:25.740]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance from deep in the heart of FEMA region six Austin, Texas
[06:26.460 --> 06:29.620]  Transmitting worldwide it's Alex Jones
[06:29.620 --> 06:37.180]  It is Super Bowl Sunday
[06:39.220 --> 06:42.900]  Let's get ready to rumble
[06:44.180 --> 06:46.740]  All of America is watching
[06:47.620 --> 06:51.700]  Feeling manly they don't have a bill of rights or constitution
[06:51.780 --> 06:57.540]  The first amendment is openly being shredded in front of everyone's eyes the federal government has announced
[06:57.540 --> 07:01.780]  It will secretly kill US citizens or arrest you and have you disappear into a black hole
[07:02.500 --> 07:07.540]  Taxes at the county city state federal international level are
[07:08.660 --> 07:13.300]  Exploding school children are being taught to spy on their parents, but by golly
[07:14.900 --> 07:20.420]  You can go sit around with your friends and just everybody can get a real serious look on their face and oh
[07:20.420 --> 07:28.420]  Oh stop my heart breathe real deep that you know when they have the kickoffs and when they have special teams and when they have a
[07:28.900 --> 07:31.700]  When they have them get up there for a for a field goal
[07:32.420 --> 07:37.540]  I mean why I've been in restaurants when people are watching a football game and and and and and you see this
[07:38.260 --> 07:40.420]  Electricity in their eyes that you see for nothing else
[07:41.140 --> 07:43.140]  I wish people
[07:43.220 --> 07:48.340]  Had a little comments about the bill of rights and constitution and our heritage that made America so great
[07:48.340 --> 07:50.580]  On the backs of their cars, but instead
[07:51.300 --> 07:53.780]  No, they've got their favorite sports team
[07:54.900 --> 08:00.100]  And see I've read all the government documents and read them here on air where the anthropologists sociologists
[08:01.060 --> 08:06.900]  Psychologists talk about using sports going back a hundred years ago to create arrested development in men
[08:08.020 --> 08:10.020]  To take your normal tribal energies
[08:10.740 --> 08:14.740]  And to arrest your development and to make you obsessed with lotteries
[08:14.740 --> 08:23.940]  Uh with sports and with things that don't matter so the global social engineers can go about life actually controlling society
[08:25.300 --> 08:27.860]  You see until just 50 60 years ago or so
[08:28.500 --> 08:32.020]  Sports were something that children were into
[08:32.900 --> 08:36.820]  And they were something that the very poorest classes were into
[08:37.700 --> 08:41.780]  The very poorest people were into gambling
[08:41.780 --> 08:43.780]  And they were into sports
[08:47.220 --> 08:52.420]  And in Rome it was called bread and circus welfare you they gave you bread
[08:53.060 --> 08:55.940]  That was the welfare doll for everybody to make you dependent
[08:56.580 --> 09:02.660]  In the lower classes and circuses government free sponsored sporting events
[09:04.020 --> 09:07.620]  And that's what the culture was into so here's the deal
[09:07.620 --> 09:15.620]  I like football growing up as much as the next person. I like basketball, baseball all of it. Okay
[09:18.260 --> 09:23.700]  But at the end of the day it's being used by social engineers
[09:25.460 --> 09:32.020]  To totally distract society from real things that are happening and that's why i'm upset about it and I know that
[09:32.020 --> 09:39.940]  A lot of people aren't conscious of this and I think you should be conscious of it. You see you need to see yourself
[09:41.220 --> 09:47.540]  As a winner you need to have successes in your life that aren't through somebody else
[09:49.620 --> 09:56.100]  And it is very very sick how men sit around and get just crazed looks in their eyes
[09:56.100 --> 10:03.700]  And argue with each other and show off to each other who knows the most about golf or who knows the most about this or that
[10:03.940 --> 10:08.180]  I'm not saying sports aren't a good thing if you're playing them. It's good. It's healthy
[10:08.500 --> 10:10.500]  It's something that should be part of your life
[10:10.820 --> 10:13.540]  But when it's everything in your life
[10:14.180 --> 10:20.180]  And the family's breaking down and society is degenerating and all these other things are unfolding
[10:22.340 --> 10:24.340]  It is very very sick
[10:24.340 --> 10:28.100]  And every civilization that is on the verge of
[10:29.060 --> 10:31.060]  giant wars imperial
[10:33.540 --> 10:35.540]  Tasmanian devil behavior
[10:36.580 --> 10:39.060]  expansionist wars corruption and collapse
[10:39.940 --> 10:41.380]  sports
[10:41.380 --> 10:43.140]  promiscuity
[10:43.140 --> 10:45.140]  family breaking down
[10:46.020 --> 10:49.220]  Decadence and and people saying I don't care
[10:49.220 --> 10:55.220]  Devil take the rest. I don't care about anybody but myself. Those are always the hallmarks
[10:56.020 --> 10:58.020]  the signpost
[10:58.020 --> 11:00.420]  For a society that is in deep trouble
[11:02.340 --> 11:04.340]  Nazi Germany
[11:04.900 --> 11:08.500]  In the build-up to Hitler totally obsessed with
[11:09.620 --> 11:13.140]  Sports with entertainment with gambling
[11:14.420 --> 11:16.420]  And people got an attitude of so what?
[11:16.420 --> 11:20.020]  Same thing has happened in every other culture. I mean here's an article
[11:20.820 --> 11:22.820]  Right here out of CBS news
[11:24.100 --> 11:26.100]  That
[11:26.180 --> 11:31.300]  Reminds me of a CNN story two days three days ago about a national survey
[11:32.100 --> 11:33.620]  headline
[11:33.620 --> 11:35.620]  consumer staying single
[11:36.660 --> 11:41.620]  And it went through the number that in just the last 30 years. They've doubled the number of
[11:41.620 --> 11:47.380]  Single people and within another two decades
[11:48.420 --> 11:55.860]  70% of people in this country will be single now. That's not a judgment about you being
[11:57.140 --> 12:01.940]  Single so you're bad. There's a lot of reasons for that. Some people are divorced. They choose to be single
[12:02.900 --> 12:04.900]  Whatever the case is but
[12:05.940 --> 12:07.940]  Expanding on that
[12:07.940 --> 12:09.940]  Expanding on that
[12:11.620 --> 12:16.980]  You cannot deny that in the textbooks we've read here on air the globalist white papers
[12:16.980 --> 12:21.940]  We've read the un documents the Planned Parenthood documents going back 50 60 70 years
[12:23.060 --> 12:25.060]  That we've done special reports on they say
[12:25.620 --> 12:31.700]  We're going to push not getting married. We're going to push open relationships. We're going to push
[12:32.420 --> 12:34.260]  chemicals in the water
[12:34.260 --> 12:38.100]  To reduce fertility and confuse sexual gender identity
[12:38.660 --> 12:45.460]  There's so much of this stuff in our water folks that the runoff into streams and rivers you can just type in fish now
[12:46.340 --> 12:50.500]  Either sterile or bisexual lizards amphibians the frogs
[12:51.620 --> 12:53.620]  It's so bad that the shrimp
[12:54.740 --> 13:01.780]  Are committing suicide in the Gulf of Mexico. There it is sex turns off many young Japanese men study
[13:01.780 --> 13:06.020]  Guys people won't believe about the shrimp committing suicide type in
[13:07.140 --> 13:09.140]  a shrimp commit suicide
[13:09.700 --> 13:12.980]  Prozac making shrimp commit suicide. It's a u.s. government report
[13:13.780 --> 13:17.380]  So much prozac is getting into the water out of the Mississippi
[13:18.980 --> 13:23.460]  Because of sewage runoff and some people are on serotonin reuptake inhibitors
[13:25.300 --> 13:29.300]  So much of it's running into the Mississippi other rivers that the shrimp
[13:29.300 --> 13:35.300]  Are on the mind-blasting fluoride-based chemical
[13:36.980 --> 13:39.220]  Now there's the headline that's not a mother nature network
[13:39.220 --> 13:44.820]  But it was originally MSNBC shrimp on prozac commit suicide study finds that shrimp swimming in prozac at every water
[13:45.780 --> 13:47.140]  tend to
[13:47.140 --> 13:50.740]  Just basically swim. We'll put it back on screen. I need to read the headline. Thanks
[13:51.300 --> 13:52.340]  Uh
[13:52.340 --> 13:56.900]  Yeah, because I was going to read the rest of the article and I I I hadn't read the the the rest of the headlines
[13:56.900 --> 13:58.740]  I won't be able to finish it
[13:58.740 --> 14:04.660]  The study finds that shrimp swimming in prozac at every water tend to swim towards the light making them easier pray
[14:05.860 --> 14:10.740]  And if you actually read deeper into the study, it's that they're not afraid of predators anymore
[14:12.260 --> 14:18.340]  It it it puts the humans and mammals and this is in the studies from the early 80s before they approved it
[14:18.820 --> 14:24.740]  Eli Lilly's prozac and there were hundreds of other variants of it over the next few decades worldwide that came out
[14:25.060 --> 14:27.060]  More than 30 variants here in the u.s
[14:27.060 --> 14:29.060]  But um
[14:30.420 --> 14:32.420]  What ends up happening
[14:33.860 --> 14:37.860]  Is every time the police pull up at a house and the woman's chopped her children up or
[14:38.020 --> 14:42.580]  Driven a car off a bridge with her kids in it or every time they go to a school
[14:42.580 --> 14:45.780]  There's a bunch of people shot in every case that I've ever seen
[14:46.900 --> 14:51.380]  They're on serotonin reuptake inhibitors because it's in the hallucinogen
[14:52.500 --> 14:54.500]  psychotropic class and on record
[14:54.500 --> 14:56.500]  Just go research it
[14:57.220 --> 15:00.740]  Puts you into a dream state into a highly suggestible
[15:01.460 --> 15:02.980]  hypnotized
[15:02.980 --> 15:04.980]  sleep state
[15:07.220 --> 15:11.540]  I mean I a few times I'm not putting these women down but in college and stuff dated girls
[15:11.540 --> 15:17.060]  I found out we're on serotonin reuptake inhibitors and I didn't even know but after a few dating four or five of them
[15:17.060 --> 15:19.060]  I would say are you taking SSRI's?
[15:20.740 --> 15:22.740]  And they'd be like yes, I do
[15:22.740 --> 15:28.340]  And I'm not going to get into how I figured out and could tell they were it's just that it's like they weren't there
[15:29.540 --> 15:34.580]  And they would well not going to get into it. The point is is they were in dream states
[15:35.460 --> 15:38.900]  Now I haven't even gotten into Iran. It's escalating towards war
[15:39.540 --> 15:42.740]  Uh a huge group of government documents and reports out
[15:43.300 --> 15:46.820]  Where the globalists are openly talking about staging false flags
[15:47.220 --> 15:51.780]  These are in public documents like you and I are idiots and don't read them saying this
[15:51.780 --> 15:53.780]  So then when they stage the attacks
[15:54.180 --> 15:57.780]  They can grandstand as heroes and we're like but you said you'd stage them

[17:26.740 --> 17:34.340]  Is only compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from
[17:34.420 --> 17:40.820]  Weather related onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks
[17:40.820 --> 17:45.460]  I really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions from science one of my oldest sponsors
[17:45.620 --> 17:51.380]  You can get more information at www dot my solar backup dot com. That's my solar backup dot com
[17:51.620 --> 17:59.300]  Remember the government doesn't own the sun. So go to my solar backup dot com or call one eight seven seven three two seven zero three six five
[18:01.460 --> 18:02.980]  Hi folks, this is alex jones
[18:02.980 --> 18:08.500]  I want to tell you about the silver lungs generator now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver
[18:08.500 --> 18:13.700]  And deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs
[18:14.260 --> 18:18.420]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses
[18:18.900 --> 18:24.980]  The silver lungs generator infuses the respiratory system with your self produced nano silver solutions
[18:25.300 --> 18:29.940]  And also delivers the silver nano particles instantly into the bloodstream
[18:30.420 --> 18:34.100]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nano silver products
[18:34.100 --> 18:39.540]  You can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the silver lungs generator
[18:40.020 --> 18:45.780]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided making production fast and simple go to
[18:46.820 --> 18:53.140]  www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the silver lungs generator. That's
[18:54.500 --> 18:56.500]  www.silverlungs.com
[18:56.500 --> 19:07.860]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone. This is our last chance to not relive history
[19:08.020 --> 19:10.020]  As we're finishing off this agenda
[19:10.420 --> 19:12.980]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath americans at home
[19:13.300 --> 19:19.140]  I've turned an endless influence on our president in congress and they really are calling the shots
[19:19.300 --> 19:24.340]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as american citizens to pay attention
[19:24.340 --> 19:29.620]  Full of the republic identifies the enemies of our nation the criminal off-short cartel
[19:29.940 --> 19:36.740]  Hell bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government. Tim Geithner, Bernanke and arsonists
[19:36.900 --> 19:42.820]  They're asking for more matches and the congress is saying who do we make the check out to today seems like nobody does care
[19:43.060 --> 19:45.060]  And right now in washington dc
[19:45.300 --> 19:52.980]  We have seen a fall of the republic yet your copy of full of the republic on dvd at info wars dot com
[19:52.980 --> 19:58.180]  We're watching online right now in super high quality at prisonplanet.tv
[20:01.140 --> 20:08.820]  Coast to coast direct from austin you're listening to the alex jones broadcasting network network
[20:11.940 --> 20:17.540]  We now take you live to the central texas command center and the heart of the resistance
[20:17.540 --> 20:23.060]  You're listening to the alex jones show
[20:24.500 --> 20:26.500]  But the point that I was getting to
[20:27.860 --> 20:33.300]  Before I went to break and then I got off into shrimp committing suicide and here's the salon magazine headline
[20:34.100 --> 20:38.180]  uh breaking that down prozac make shrimp commit suicide
[20:39.940 --> 20:44.900]  Well, it's the same thing with humans. They now have to put on the inserts of those drugs that it increases suicide
[20:44.900 --> 20:48.020]  It's funny how they give it to people who they claim are suicidal
[20:48.420 --> 20:52.020]  And then when the suicide problem gets worse their answer is we'll put you on three or four
[20:52.580 --> 20:56.740]  Of these drugs at once the these are drug pushing companies
[20:57.700 --> 21:03.460]  But I got into that just seeing the cbs news headline sex turns off many young japanese men
[21:06.100 --> 21:12.100]  And they just think it's gross they just they just the uh the study shows they're pretty much just asexual
[21:12.100 --> 21:14.100]  And that's what the
[21:14.820 --> 21:20.820]  This being all a that the rockerfeller foundation publicly has written about that we've done reports on and linked to
[21:21.300 --> 21:26.420]  Just type in rockerfeller foundation on chemicals and water to reduce fertility and sex drive
[21:27.220 --> 21:29.220]  1952 1965
[21:30.180 --> 21:35.220]  Uh rockerfeller foundation vaccines to reduce fertility covertly added to population
[21:35.540 --> 21:40.100]  Or just type in white house science our current czar talks about different things
[21:40.100 --> 21:43.940]  They like to add to the water to do it. See this is all going on, but it's not
[21:44.500 --> 21:47.780]  Manly to get upset about having your food and water jacked
[21:48.660 --> 21:51.620]  And your culture dying and the end of the west
[21:53.140 --> 21:54.420]  No, no, no, no, no
[21:54.420 --> 21:59.060]  That's not manly when you're being assaulted to actually be scientific informed and warning people
[21:59.380 --> 22:04.900]  I'm just supposed to put on a big jersey go to a bar and eat a bunch of uh gmo stuff
[22:05.540 --> 22:07.540]  With fat all over it soaked
[22:07.540 --> 22:09.540]  Uh in msg and get brain damage
[22:10.580 --> 22:13.140]  Uh and scream and yell and act tough
[22:13.860 --> 22:16.740]  And then I would be a real man. I hear it as rockerfeller
[22:16.820 --> 22:21.620]  In fact, you guys are uh pulling it up from info wars.com then just link to the foundation itself
[22:21.940 --> 22:23.940]  But rockerfeller foundation documents
[22:24.660 --> 22:27.220]  Sterilence and vaccines. Good job pulling that up
[22:27.780 --> 22:32.340]  Rockerfeller foundation developed vaccines for mass scale fertility reduction
[22:32.340 --> 22:39.380]  And uh then you can link to the 1968 yearly report. That's just one of many and then of course what's called for was done exactly
[22:40.340 --> 22:45.140]  And I've seen the university reports where they laugh. They said well by uh 2020
[22:45.460 --> 22:50.980]  Most men won't even be able to get a get a woman pregnant and most men won't want to
[22:51.940 --> 22:56.900]  Uh and of course I've shown you the plant parenthood doc where they talked about the chemicals in the food and water
[22:56.900 --> 23:03.780]  Uh and from the 1950s we can pull that up for folks maybe uh where they say we're going to encourage homosexuality and we're going to jack your food and water
[23:04.340 --> 23:09.700]  And then of course they've had hundreds of publications attack me for republishing that they never it's a straw man
[23:09.700 --> 23:15.700]  They always just say I'm bashing gay people and saying the government did it. It's not a discussion of what people are doing sexually
[23:16.100 --> 23:23.780]  You understand they say they did it to you. Does it mean that there weren't people doing this normally or naturally or whatever in 2000 years ago?
[23:23.780 --> 23:31.620]  Or 500 years ago or whatever. No the point is the frogs the male frogs think they're females now
[23:32.340 --> 23:35.540]  That's not when I say that about a frog. I'm not bashing the gay frog
[23:36.260 --> 23:38.260]  But the chemical got in the water
[23:38.500 --> 23:44.180]  There's so much of it in our water it runs off and makes him in fact it actually changes them in reproduction
[23:44.340 --> 23:48.180]  They end up being a mathrodites that people won't believe that look up, uh
[23:49.380 --> 23:51.540]  Laykes and streams fitness
[23:51.540 --> 23:58.020]  lakes and streams, fish, hemaphrodites, fish sterile, or frog sterile, and I've seen reports
[23:58.020 --> 24:03.780]  of in some rivers two-thirds of fish sterile because of chemicals in water. See, I'm telling
[24:03.780 --> 24:14.020]  you about a poison, but here's CBS, call Japan the incredible shrinking country. Fewer babies
[24:14.020 --> 24:18.600]  mean Japan's population could plunge by 30% in coming decades and already has. There are
[24:18.600 --> 24:22.780]  many reasons for this demographic freefall. For instance, Japan has all but closed foreign
[24:22.780 --> 24:27.980]  immigrants. Yeah, but countries could always grow without immigrants. The United States
[24:27.980 --> 24:34.500]  had a two, for every two people in 1900, you look these numbers up, on average had about
[24:34.500 --> 24:41.580]  four and a half children. That's the ones that lived. You know, the old families that
[24:41.580 --> 24:47.340]  they told you weren't trendy, and you know, all the shows, you know, the programming
[24:47.340 --> 24:52.460]  of, oh, having kids is horrible. Oh my gosh, you got kids, it's terrible. My wife even
[24:52.460 --> 24:56.100]  has like trendies come up and hiss at her at old foods and say, you've got three kids,
[24:56.100 --> 25:00.580]  that's not good for the earth. I mean, there is sex-changing chemicals found at Potomac
[25:00.580 --> 25:06.460]  River. And that's National Geographic News, and it talks about the fish and the frogs
[25:06.460 --> 25:12.140]  and things being hemaphrodites or being sterilized. But again, I'm bashing the gay fish. Now,
[25:12.140 --> 25:19.140]  let's continue here. Propaganda everywhere. Almost every new cartoon, sitcoms, dramas,
[25:19.140 --> 25:26.060]  it's hellish to have children, hellish to be married. And again, this is being done.
[25:26.060 --> 25:31.260]  If it was your choice normally, that always happened. That's fine. We're not bashing single
[25:31.260 --> 25:36.860]  families here. The point is this modern culture is designed to wreck the family. That's why
[25:36.860 --> 25:42.020]  it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy of it being horrible. Just like every action-adventure
[25:42.020 --> 25:47.020]  movie I see, I saw two in the last week, law-abiding citizen in source code. But in both of these
[25:47.020 --> 25:51.940]  right-wingers or terrorists, checkpoints are everywhere, SWAT teams are everywhere, and
[25:51.940 --> 25:56.820]  the right-wing guy in source code wants to nuke Chicago. It doesn't happen in reality,
[25:56.820 --> 26:02.340]  but it's a simulated reality. See, it's out of the propaganda that you know what they're
[26:02.340 --> 26:09.140]  going to do next. And I'm now digressing. But it goes on. There are many reasons for
[26:09.140 --> 26:14.940]  the demographic freefall. But young Japanese men are taking some of the blame for Japan's
[26:14.940 --> 26:21.340]  population decline. Studies show young males are apathetic about dating and disinterested
[26:21.340 --> 26:28.300]  in sex. Ladies and gentlemen, by the time I was 13 years old, well, I mean, I remember
[26:28.300 --> 26:32.900]  being, you know, in first grade and the other boys were going, girls, ooh, and I just thought
[26:32.900 --> 26:36.740]  they were cute and sweet and wanted to be friends with them, you know. And the same thing when
[26:36.740 --> 26:40.660]  I was 13 years old, you know, I thought the college girls were the most beautiful thing
[26:40.660 --> 26:45.280]  on earth, and I just knew they smelled good, they looked good, and I'd never seen anything
[26:45.280 --> 26:51.040]  prettier than that. I mean, we're talking worship here. Now, thank God, despite the
[26:51.040 --> 26:55.780]  fluoride and misfying all day and things, I still had enough of my olfactory nerves
[26:55.780 --> 27:00.260]  lined up, it's a lot of its smell. My eyes were still cued up, right? Everything was
[27:00.260 --> 27:04.540]  still, you know, pointed in the right direction. And I'm fulfilled. I've got a wife, I've
[27:04.540 --> 27:11.140]  got children. It's wonderful. But we also understand that we're tribal, and it's us
[27:11.140 --> 27:15.540]  for the family against the New World Order. Families have always been about defending
[27:15.540 --> 27:19.860]  each other. And hey, we may have problems, but remember, we're the only people in the
[27:19.860 --> 27:24.020]  world that care about each other and have got each other's backs. That's the oldest
[27:24.020 --> 27:30.700]  thing in human existence, just like a mound of meerkats. Man, they all know each other's
[27:30.700 --> 27:36.420]  tail. They get little squabbles, but they're on each other's teams. Honey badgers, wolves,
[27:36.420 --> 27:48.020]  coyotes, bears, otters, whales, rats, mice. This is what it is to be colony mammals.
[27:48.020 --> 27:54.740]  That's what we are. We're colony mammals that can change our destiny and have free will
[27:54.740 --> 28:00.220]  and can build spacecraft that go to foreign planets. And they gave you Mozart, Beethoven,
[28:00.220 --> 28:12.380]  Brom, quantum mechanics, the full integrated predictive future program systems you know
[28:12.380 --> 28:17.860]  as search engines, which are actually crystal ball integration systems to map human activity
[28:17.860 --> 28:25.340]  for over the horizon time prediction qualities. Humans can do incredible things. The globalists
[28:25.340 --> 28:31.380]  know that, they're scared of you. And so that's why society's collapsing. And when Nancy Pelosi
[28:31.380 --> 28:36.100]  comes out and says, it's goober having abortions and less people, this will save money. How
[28:36.100 --> 28:43.220]  is 1.3 children the average American? Two people have average 1.3 children. How is that going
[28:43.220 --> 28:48.420]  to replace the society? Well, the globalists have said in Wired Magazine, other places
[28:48.420 --> 28:52.420]  that they plan on just setting up a world government and exterminating most people.
[28:52.420 --> 28:56.940]  So that's why they've got control the west and you see populations plunging. We'll come
[28:56.940 --> 28:58.940]  back with the Iran situation.
[28:58.940 --> 29:04.500]  Hi, this is Alex Jones. Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid
[29:04.500 --> 29:09.300]  seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle? Did you know that in a real meltdown,
[29:09.300 --> 29:13.140]  non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold? It's true, seeds have
[29:13.140 --> 29:16.620]  all performed even gold and silver before in this country. And it's possible that could
[29:16.620 --> 29:21.180]  even happen again. So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect
[29:21.180 --> 29:27.380]  mix of non-hybrid seeds. They call it a survival seed bank and it can produce an endless supply
[29:27.380 --> 29:31.940]  of nutrient dense food for you and your family. And here's the best part. These seeds have
[29:31.940 --> 29:36.620]  not been genetically modified in any way and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full
[29:36.620 --> 29:43.460]  acre crisis garden. So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com. That's survivalseedbank.com

[32:22.140 --> 32:27.260]  expanded nationwide. This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has

[33:18.780 --> 33:27.380]  Okay, let me just finish up with Japan that signed on to the same globalist program. They
[33:27.380 --> 33:29.340]  drink the sodium fluoride, they take all the vaccines and they warm up their microwave
[33:29.340 --> 33:34.300]  dinners in the little, uh, between all eight line packaging, their soft drinks, their juice
[33:34.300 --> 33:41.780]  boxes. This is CBS News. Studies show young males are apathetic about dating and disinterested
[33:41.780 --> 33:49.500]  in sex. One college student says, I'm not the guy. In fact, for people watching on prisonplanet.tv,
[33:49.500 --> 33:53.020]  not listening on the radio, show people the photo of these guys. These are not men. These
[33:53.020 --> 33:58.980]  are, these are, these are gilded asexual drones that the UN said they would create when Julian
[33:58.980 --> 34:03.740]  Huxley set this program up. He was the first director general of UNESCO. You may have heard
[34:03.740 --> 34:07.500]  of his brother's book, Brave New World, who he went public about. And so this is actually
[34:07.500 --> 34:14.260]  the plan to make you all asexual drones. Look at them, asexual drones. I mean, they don't
[34:14.260 --> 34:18.660]  even want to have sex with anything. This is what they've been turned into. That's what
[34:18.660 --> 34:24.340]  the globalists want. Continuing here, one college student says, it's not that guys don't
[34:24.340 --> 34:30.900]  like women, but it's just easier and more fun to hang out with other guys. Another says,
[34:30.900 --> 34:38.220]  if you want a date, you have to ask the guy out for yourself. That's what a girl says.
[34:38.220 --> 34:44.900]  Once a male chauvinist paradise, Japan is suddenly the home of assertive women. Oh yeah,
[34:44.900 --> 34:48.500]  under Hitler, it was first you get the women, then you've got the children, so follow the
[34:48.500 --> 34:55.580]  men. Once a male chauvinist paradise, Japan is suddenly the home of assertive women and
[34:55.580 --> 35:02.380]  so-called grass feeder men. Sensitive, even asexual creatures, overshadowed by their
[35:02.380 --> 35:08.100]  female peers. I can't tell you about all the documents we've shown you here on air where
[35:08.100 --> 35:12.940]  they said they do this, and they are trying to jack the food, the water, the most, the
[35:12.940 --> 35:18.780]  toilet paper, as bisphenol a mixed in with it. It's kind of like aspartame. We start
[35:18.780 --> 35:23.340]  exposing it in the last few decades. So most people stop drinking it in soft drinks. So
[35:23.340 --> 35:28.700]  they just put it in now over 10,000 products. It's in all the sugar gums. It's in most
[35:28.700 --> 35:32.780]  the chocolates. You think, well, this is sugar chocolate. Read the label. Read the label
[35:32.780 --> 35:39.860]  of the juicy fruit, the big red, the winter green. Read it. Read it. The candy mince,
[35:39.860 --> 35:45.100]  the bread, the TV dinners. You think you're eating a TV dinner with a Salisbury steak and
[35:45.100 --> 35:50.980]  some potatoes? It's got aspartame in it. Highly addictive breakdown of what alcohol, because
[35:50.980 --> 35:57.420]  you know why? What alcohol is hellishly addictive? You think regular alcohol is addictive? What
[35:57.420 --> 36:03.340]  alcohol is addictive? There's probably nothing more addictive than arsenic. You know, there's
[36:03.340 --> 36:09.620]  big problems going back hundreds of years with arsenic addicts. But I digress with
[36:09.620 --> 36:15.620]  science here. The point is, is that these food additives are really drugs, many of them.
[36:15.620 --> 36:20.060]  You know, this all predates even regulation, but they're all grandfathered. Did you know
[36:20.060 --> 36:24.740]  that all the major fast food chains, you can pull this up, pull it up. Chicken McNuggets
[36:24.740 --> 36:29.620]  has, people won't believe it. Chicken McNuggets, it'll be CNN AP Reuters from like five years
[36:29.620 --> 36:35.460]  ago. Chicken McNuggets has silicone in it. Now, now, now, now, now you think some silicone
[36:35.460 --> 36:40.020]  in a woman's breast breaking out is bad and it gives them cancer, leukemia, all this stuff
[36:40.020 --> 36:45.700]  proven just a little bit leaking. But hey, why not eat it? Why wonder why the kidney
[36:45.700 --> 36:51.940]  failure is happening? Why even wonder? I mean, remember in China three years ago, they killed,
[36:51.940 --> 36:58.540]  they executed a bunch of top factory owners because they were putting between all A in
[36:58.540 --> 37:02.300]  the milk products and in the cheeses because it could fool the testing they were putting
[37:02.300 --> 37:09.340]  in to get around fake milk, powdered milk. Now, there it is. All McNuggets not created
[37:09.340 --> 37:15.340]  equal and it's a CNN article, as you can see there about the silicone, but it sure makes
[37:15.340 --> 37:21.820]  them fluffy and puff up and have that special taste. See, poisons are addictive, but I'm
[37:21.820 --> 37:28.700]  digressing if the government says it's okay. I mean, they care about you and I'm the extremist.
[37:28.700 --> 37:35.220]  I should be a good dad pull over get a big old fried chicken from any of these big chains
[37:35.220 --> 37:39.780]  and I should just take my son and put the ball game on and go, here you go, son, you'll
[37:39.780 --> 37:48.660]  be lucky if you don't have, you know, kidney failure. They also contain dimethyl polysiloxine,
[37:48.660 --> 37:55.860]  an anti foaming agent, also used in silly putty. That's another one. And they've got
[37:55.860 --> 38:01.980]  the silicone, the pull that back up. It's a small memorable reading. I just want to give
[38:01.980 --> 38:09.500]  this a CNN, but can they tell you they don't remove it. That is the tertiary by the hydrone
[38:09.500 --> 38:15.180]  quinoneon. Is that correct? Did I get that right? I mean, come on, you know, I'm an
[38:15.180 --> 38:20.820]  extremist, you know, I'm a weirdo. Again, I talk to people on the street or I sometimes
[38:20.820 --> 38:25.700]  have, I get drug out to some family dinner with some friends or something and they're
[38:25.700 --> 38:30.580]  like, I like your show, but do you really believe all this stuff you say? Gee, I'm the
[38:30.580 --> 38:35.420]  only show I know that everything I say, I document. I mean, everything I've been saying
[38:35.420 --> 38:40.300]  here from the Rockefeller Foundation and sterilants and vaccines and cancer viruses
[38:40.300 --> 38:45.940]  and vaccines, I put it on screen. I mean, I could say right now, United States has the
[38:45.940 --> 38:51.660]  highest cancer rate in the world up on average over 2000% depending on the type. You could
[38:51.660 --> 38:55.900]  type that into a search engine to get World Health Organization reports. They never ask
[38:55.900 --> 39:01.180]  why it's skyrocketing. They just ask, give us more money. We'll find a cure. Oh, really?
[39:01.180 --> 39:07.860]  To the vaccines where you add on average more than 40 cancer viruses per major vaccine
[39:07.860 --> 39:15.060]  tested and your body fights it off and fights it off and finally gives up and you die. You
[39:15.060 --> 39:18.900]  wonder why everybody's getting allergies. I got family that's lived in Austin their entire
[39:18.900 --> 39:23.300]  life, never had allergies. They've got them now. All the big studies show it's linked
[39:23.300 --> 39:28.580]  to your body already so overwhelmed with all the additives and all the crud that it just
[39:28.580 --> 39:32.700]  starts fighting everything. And you better be glad you got allergies because you know
[39:32.700 --> 39:40.060]  what that means? It means your body is fighting hard because when you stop having them, your
[39:40.060 --> 39:45.980]  body's not going to fight that cancer either. You know, most people get cancer every week.
[39:45.980 --> 39:50.540]  Most people under 30, you can look this up, get cancer every week. People who are above
[39:50.540 --> 39:54.420]  60 on average are getting cancer every day but fighting it off. You can pull those numbers
[39:54.420 --> 40:01.660]  up. Those are general breakdowns. It varies from study to study. But you're not told
[40:01.660 --> 40:06.100]  all that, are you? You're told, take these antibiotics that are linked to cancer because
[40:06.100 --> 40:11.100]  they shut down your immune system. Take all these shots. Everything's going to be great.
[40:11.100 --> 40:19.140]  And then as breast cancer is up several thousand percentile, we never talk about finding a
[40:19.140 --> 40:27.220]  cause where it's always find the cure. I mean that'd be like if I fell off a cliff, a hundred
[40:27.220 --> 40:31.980]  foot cliff and broke both my legs and they came and said, now as soon as we mend your
[40:31.980 --> 40:36.060]  legs and put them in cast and they heal in six weeks, we want you to jump right back
[40:36.060 --> 40:42.420]  off that cliff again because we're finding a cure to your broken legs. How about don't
[40:42.420 --> 40:46.420]  jump off a cliff? Yeah, here's the Daily Mail. Two fizzy drinks a week can raise your chances
[40:46.420 --> 40:51.780]  of getting pancreatic cancer by 87 percent. That's a big study. And then they send these
[40:51.780 --> 40:59.300]  studies. We don't know why. Of course, it turns out the ones with the aspartame it's
[40:59.300 --> 41:05.500]  even higher. I'll tell you why. I was telling you about this phenol A and all the rest of
[41:05.500 --> 41:10.300]  it. But remember melamine three years ago? They executed the people in China that did
[41:10.300 --> 41:15.500]  it. Thousand sick, hundreds dying. But over here they got pediatric wards full of little
[41:15.500 --> 41:20.580]  kids having a failure, but they just don't even test. It's just, well, we don't test
[41:20.580 --> 41:26.260]  why it's happening. We're just gonna, we're just gonna put your baby on dialysis now or
[41:26.260 --> 41:33.420]  try to get him some kidney replacements because our own FDA, the Loving FDA came out with
[41:33.420 --> 41:40.220]  about a year into that three years ago. Type in headline FDA some melamine, not bad or
[41:40.220 --> 41:47.980]  type in this Washington Post, another one. 90 percent of major corn syrup brands have
[41:47.980 --> 41:56.460]  high levels of lead and mercury in them. How about that? How about that one? You could
[41:56.460 --> 42:01.220]  type that in and look at it. And then they never ask in the article why. I went and did
[42:01.220 --> 42:09.380]  some research and found out why. I went and did some research and found out why. Maybe
[42:09.380 --> 42:13.600]  I shouldn't tell you. Maybe I should have you go look it up. Would you like me to tell
[42:13.600 --> 42:20.300]  you why? Or do you even care? Are you listening to this radio show? And do you hear? I understand.
[42:20.300 --> 42:27.220]  I'm a weirdo. Again, I go out to eat with people who aren't listeners sometimes or at
[42:27.220 --> 42:32.420]  events or church or whatever. And they say, do you really believe all this? I mean, I,
[42:32.420 --> 42:38.940]  you know, wow, you're, it's really weird that you know all this. It's weird. See, I should
[42:38.940 --> 42:47.420]  be at a sports bar right now sticking my chest out, acting tough in a real, you know, shallow
[42:47.420 --> 42:52.940]  way with people that aren't my friends and who don't care about me. And again, I should
[42:52.940 --> 43:00.420]  have my kids there having to meet MSG so they're brain damaged. That's what a man does.
[43:00.420 --> 43:05.260]  A little over a year ago, I began to do a lot of research into why, even though I had
[43:05.260 --> 43:10.180]  a pretty good size meal that I was still starving. And my research led me to a well-known fact
[43:10.180 --> 43:14.380]  that most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the United States and across the
[43:14.380 --> 43:19.780]  industrialized world are almost completely depleted of almost all of the key minerals
[43:19.780 --> 43:24.820]  and trace elements that our bodies need to rebuild themselves, fight off cancer, and
[43:24.820 --> 43:30.740]  be healthy. I then searched out the best vitamin and mineral company out there and discovered
[43:30.740 --> 43:35.380]  Young Jevity. The Young Jevity products are designed to give you the real nutrition you
[43:35.380 --> 43:40.020]  need. And once you've got that, you don't have to eat as much to be satisfied. I've

[44:02.880 --> 44:07.620]  buying a solar power generator. Number one, new climate legislation could easily double
[44:07.620 --> 44:11.980]  or triple your electric bill. Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how
[44:11.980 --> 44:16.700]  much power your electric company allows you to have. It's true. Total government control
[44:16.700 --> 44:22.020]  of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming. Number three, in some areas of
[44:22.020 --> 44:27.060]  the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded. And now new socialist legislation
[44:27.060 --> 44:31.500]  is only compounding the problem. Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local
[44:31.500 --> 44:36.140]  grids. Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages. Number
[44:36.140 --> 44:41.140]  five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind. Folks,
[44:41.140 --> 44:44.740]  I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of
[44:44.740 --> 44:51.940]  my oldest sponsors. You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com. That's mysolarbackup.com.

[46:00.900 --> 46:05.860]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone. This is our last
[46:05.860 --> 46:11.380]  chance to not relive history. As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug
[46:11.380 --> 46:17.580]  from underneath Americans at home. I have tremendous influence on our president in Congress,
[46:17.580 --> 46:22.820]  and they really are calling the shots. I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American
[46:22.820 --> 46:28.060]  citizens to pay attention. For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the
[46:28.060 --> 46:33.700]  criminal offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty, and on its ashes constructing
[46:33.700 --> 46:38.340]  world government. Tim Geithner, Bernanke, and arsonists, they're asking for more matches,
[46:38.340 --> 46:42.180]  and the Congress is saying, who do we make the checkout to? Today it seems like nobody
[46:42.180 --> 46:58.220]  does care, and right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[30:25.120 --> 47:29.620]  live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting world-wide, it's Alex Jones.
[47:29.620 --> 47:38.100]  Alright, look, I tend to get in here, do all this preparation for hours at home, an hour
[47:38.100 --> 47:42.100]  before airtime here in the office, and they never even cover anything I've got in front
[47:42.100 --> 47:48.740]  of me. And there's got to be, like, I don't know, 15 or more mainstream news articles
[47:48.740 --> 47:53.500]  demonizing us, which I love, just the last 24 hours, and I haven't even mentioned any
[47:53.500 --> 47:57.620]  of those, because it really shows we're hurting them bad. The more demonization the better,
[47:57.620 --> 48:01.100]  the more attacks the better, the more enjoyable it is, because it means I'm hurting these
[48:01.100 --> 48:06.620]  globalists. They did find one of the articles, it's Seattle Post Intelligence, sir, not
[48:06.620 --> 48:15.940]  Washington Post, and a big study that came out in 2009, study Mercury found in high fructose
[48:15.940 --> 48:21.860]  corn syrup, researchers reported finding Mercury in nearly 50% of tested samples of
[48:21.860 --> 48:26.380]  commercial high fructose corn syrup, a separate study by a nonprofit group found Mercury in
[48:26.380 --> 48:37.500]  nearly a third of 55 popular brand name foods and drinks, where HFCS is the first and second
[48:37.500 --> 48:43.460]  ingredient. Folks, they are authorized by the criminal government to do this, and here's
[48:43.460 --> 48:49.700]  the deal, this is done on purpose. Remember, five years ago when Bayer Pharmaceutical finally
[48:49.700 --> 48:55.420]  got convicted in France and Australia, not here in the US, Bayer that funded the Nazis
[48:55.420 --> 49:00.500]  thing, yeah, that was part of the experiments, all of it, eugenicists, the big drug companies,
[49:00.500 --> 49:05.620]  almost all scientists globally, 100 years ago were eugenicists, they believed in master
[49:05.620 --> 49:10.700]  race reducing population. They found in all the major drug companies that are out there,
[49:10.700 --> 49:16.020]  that's why they're still the same, but it came out in court, and you can look this up,
[49:16.020 --> 49:23.140]  just type in Bayer knew factor eight had HIV hepatitis for 10 years and shipped it out
[49:23.140 --> 49:28.060]  to everybody knowing it was a death sentence, and they didn't just do that, they didn't
[49:28.060 --> 49:35.660]  just know for 10 years and not care, they're eugenicists, they believe this was good for
[49:35.660 --> 49:40.740]  the hemophiliacs to die, you can pull up the newscast on it, you can pull up the minutes
[49:40.740 --> 49:45.420]  of their executives laughing about it, and you're like, but that doesn't sound human,
[49:45.420 --> 49:53.660]  they're not a globalist, they think of you as dumb animals, they get off on it, I mean
[49:53.660 --> 49:58.660]  are they right, are they right, I mean is this what people deserve, is this what people
[49:58.660 --> 50:05.100]  want, is this who you really are, I mean I'm here telling you that most products that
[50:05.100 --> 50:12.620]  are processed have melamine, and have bisphene all A, and have aspartame, and have fluoride,
[50:12.620 --> 50:17.700]  and thousands of studies together, their own documents, and then I find the documents
[50:17.700 --> 50:23.820]  where they admit they're doing it on purpose, and I have to then sit there and watch the
[50:23.820 --> 50:34.260]  perpetrators on the news as philanthropists, giving money to GMO our food and force vaccinations,
[50:34.260 --> 50:41.660]  there it is hemophiliac suits as Bayer products cause HIV hepatitis C, that's from 2003, it's
[50:41.660 --> 50:46.260]  been, they've since won those cases and people have been to prison for it, it's out of the
[50:46.260 --> 50:51.900]  sun times, I doubt that link will still work for 2003, but good job finding that old article.
[50:51.900 --> 50:57.340]  Yeah, we were just digging around there and found a tape from 1999 on my radio show where
[50:57.340 --> 51:06.220]  I had the doctor on who worked in the Arkansas prisons, and they were, the jail guards were
[51:06.220 --> 51:13.700]  told by the state, sell drugs to all your inmates because we'll take blood from them
[51:13.700 --> 51:17.420]  every two, three days, doesn't matter if they're like scarecrow zombies, they want their cocaine
[51:17.420 --> 51:21.980]  and methamphetamine, and it doesn't, and this all came out in the news, it doesn't matter
[51:21.980 --> 51:27.660]  if they've all got HIV and hepatitis, the company in Canada was buying the blood out
[51:27.660 --> 51:31.220]  of Arkansas and all their prisons, Clinton was getting part of the money, it's called
[51:31.220 --> 51:36.340]  the Arkansas blood scandal, you can pull it up, and a week after I interviewed that doctor,
[51:36.340 --> 51:42.700]  they fire bombed his clinic, the same night they robbed the hemophiliac society in Canada
[51:42.700 --> 51:46.540]  to try to get the computers, but it didn't help them, but it didn't matter, they didn't
[51:46.540 --> 51:52.700]  get in trouble, I mean, I guess in France they put some people in jail, some executives,
[51:52.700 --> 51:59.380]  but that was just a small part of it, and just imagine, yeah, we'll buy as much blood
[51:59.380 --> 52:06.220]  as you got, where you got? Well, we got a bunch of people with HIV and AIDS and hepatitis
[52:06.220 --> 52:11.420]  and tuberculosis and everything else you want, give us all the blood we can get, and then
[52:11.420 --> 52:15.740]  I interviewed the guy and he gets fire bombed, in fact, just type in for folks, we'll show
[52:15.740 --> 52:20.140]  them, and listeners on radio can do this if you're not watching at prisonplanet.tv, just
[52:20.140 --> 52:24.940]  type in Arkansas blood scandal, and that'll give folks a place to start, and people are
[52:24.940 --> 52:30.180]  like, well, then why don't they just kill you? Most common question, I say it almost
[52:30.180 --> 52:34.700]  every show, because if they kill me, it underlines everything I say, it highlights it, it puts
[52:34.700 --> 52:42.660]  20 exclamation points behind it. Also, I'm under such incredible surveillance by multi-agencies,
[52:42.660 --> 52:47.620]  and I've been sent letters from the Army, leaked, that Ron Paul and myself have Army
[52:47.620 --> 52:58.700]  intelligence watching us, and going over all of that, you know, there it was that we have
[52:58.700 --> 53:03.540]  rallies and stuff, they have plain clothes Army there watching us, saying, don't let
[53:03.540 --> 53:09.140]  them know you're an Army, they may kill you, yes, I might kill you, they say, how ridiculous.
[53:09.140 --> 53:13.100]  Of course, I shouldn't be sarcastic and go, oh, yes, we might kill you. Now, look at this
[53:13.100 --> 53:18.700]  Daily Mail article, it was also in L.A. Times, Muslim businesswoman becomes terrorist suspect
[53:18.700 --> 53:24.340]  after he tech staff, he's going to blow away the competition, and we'll show folks a document
[53:24.340 --> 53:31.260]  cam here of this, this guy runs a major telecommunications company in Quebec, and they were going to
[53:31.260 --> 53:35.860]  a trade show, and he said, I want to blow away the competition with our products, and
[53:35.860 --> 53:40.860]  they raided his house, said he was a terrorist, arrested him, indefinitely detained him, and
[53:40.860 --> 53:47.580]  told his wife he is a terrorist, but wait, it gets better. Two young Brits, as you know,
[53:47.580 --> 53:56.980]  last week, a guy and his girlfriend, that's probably his crime right there, he likes blondes,
[53:56.980 --> 54:00.660]  two British friends were detained at Los Angeles airport, after Department of Homeland Security
[54:00.660 --> 54:05.260]  misinterpreted several statements on their Twitter, and one message was, we're going
[54:05.260 --> 54:10.580]  to party, paint the town red, yeah, burn it down, you know, that kind of statement, it
[54:10.580 --> 54:15.540]  was, yeah, we're going to party, yeah, we're going to destroy L.A., awesome, man, I'm going
[54:15.540 --> 54:21.140]  to visit this and that, I mean, the system knows that it was a figure of speech, but
[54:21.140 --> 54:28.460]  it's about the mindlessness of it, oh, a five-year-old was arrested today for running at recess,
[54:28.460 --> 54:32.220]  people won't believe that, show them this, because I thought it was just the kid arrested
[54:32.220 --> 54:37.140]  for touching the other kid's leg in tag and being sexually charged with sexual assault,
[54:37.140 --> 54:44.380]  then I found AP town hall, I found just scores of list of all over the nation, five-year-olds,
[54:44.380 --> 54:49.260]  seven-year-olds are arrested and charged under juvenile court, the parents don't know their
[54:49.260 --> 54:53.300]  rights, wave their kids' rights, and that's their life's over, they're in the system,
[54:53.300 --> 55:00.300]  for jogging at recess, type in running now illegal at recess, I thought you just got
[55:00.300 --> 55:05.780]  in trouble, no, no, no, you go to jail.
[55:05.780 --> 55:12.300]  So this is the new system, now, I know the holy sacrament of bunch of steroid heads running
[55:12.300 --> 55:18.540]  around fighting with each other on the field, true manliness, true manliness, not protecting
[55:18.540 --> 55:24.180]  your kids from all this, but the true manliness is about to happen in 30 minutes, and all
[55:24.180 --> 55:30.820]  the propaganda and the terrible music and just all of the cheap cultural death that's
[55:30.820 --> 55:36.180]  destroying our culture is coming up in the good wholesome football game, and all the
[55:36.180 --> 55:41.140]  people, you know, there are 200 pounds overweight, there's the town hall article by George Will
[55:41.140 --> 55:48.900]  where it says, arresting five-year-olds, running at recess, Washington, called to a
[55:48.900 --> 55:53.740]  Florida school that could not cope, police led the disorderly student away in handcuffs,
[55:53.740 --> 56:04.660]  all 40 pounds of the five-year-old, the crime, running at recess, anyways, imagine all of
[56:04.660 --> 56:09.860]  the people drinking the poison, 200 pounds overweight, starving for nutrients, eating
[56:09.860 --> 56:17.180]  all the calories, but devoid of nutrients, the self-propelled stomachs, rolling into
[56:17.180 --> 56:23.340]  the TSA facility, everyone gets a genital grove, small children taught to be molested,
[56:23.340 --> 56:29.980]  psychologists to put it on record, TSA, feds out of jurisdiction, big Jumbotron screens
[56:29.980 --> 56:37.180]  with Janet Napolitano, oh, you did find Arkansas Times contaminated, blah, we'll just put that
[56:37.180 --> 56:42.660]  up then, better late than never, bloody awful how money and politics contaminated Arkansas's
[56:42.660 --> 56:48.460]  prison plasma program was always corrupt, an open vampire system, I'm sorry, let me
[56:48.460 --> 56:54.740]  continue here, TSA is now popping up at checkpoints all over the country, oh, you will not escape
[56:54.740 --> 56:58.820]  pedophiles grabbing your genitals and your children's genitals, but here it is, TSA trains
[56:58.820 --> 57:04.460]  Super Bowl hot dog sellers to spot terrorists, Viper search team to be out in force before
[57:04.460 --> 57:10.060]  Sunday's big game, Drudge picked that up Friday, and Fox News does this all the time now, they
[57:10.060 --> 57:16.580]  took our article, left our name on it, published it, and put on the headline, TSA deploys wiener
[57:16.580 --> 57:25.060]  watchers at Super Bowl, and again, little control freaks spying on everyone, they're
[57:25.060 --> 57:29.700]  teaching us not to trust each other, but trust the big jumbo screen of Homeland Security
[57:29.700 --> 57:35.220]  head who openly ordered the underwear bomber to be put on the plane, that's on record,
[57:35.220 --> 57:39.180]  I mean the government runs the terrorists, it's the foreign banks that have hijacked
[57:39.180 --> 57:44.100]  America and the TV shows all of it selling you a terror threat that doesn't exist, honey
[57:44.100 --> 57:50.860]  bees are far more deadly than terrorists, we'll be right back.
[57:50.860 --> 57:55.180]  I've been telling you about E-Foods Direct for a while now, here are my top 10 reasons

[58:51.420 --> 58:56.180]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones, I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings,

[59:17.180 --> 59:23.440]  risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores and deteriorating

[01:00:05.900 --> 01:00:25.060]  Okay, the incredible moment, the great alignment of the planets is going to happen in 30 minutes,
[01:00:25.060 --> 01:00:31.380]  we're going to see real men out there running into each other and trying to put a pig skin
[01:00:31.380 --> 01:00:38.260]  across the yard line, that's what's important and we're going to be discussing that, look
[01:00:38.260 --> 01:00:42.300]  here's the deal, I might even go to a football game occasionally if our country wasn't in
[01:00:42.300 --> 01:00:47.220]  such dire straits, I want to be clear about that, now I will cover the rest of the news
[01:00:47.220 --> 01:00:54.940]  in the next segment and then I will go to your phone calls for the last 45 minutes of
[01:00:54.940 --> 01:01:02.500]  the show today, I want to give first time callers a chance here on the Sunday show because
[01:01:02.500 --> 01:01:07.780]  we can take thousands of calls here and I love hearing callers that are able to get
[01:01:07.780 --> 01:01:13.860]  to on a routine basis but I don't screen your calls so sometimes I do notice a few of the
[01:01:13.860 --> 01:01:18.300]  same people there which is great but I want to give others a chance, am I wrong in the
[01:01:18.300 --> 01:01:25.020]  direction I'm taking the broadcast, is it wrong that I'm upset about melamine in the
[01:01:25.020 --> 01:01:31.380]  food or mercury and lead in the soft drinks at high levels, am I wrong when CNBC says
[01:01:31.380 --> 01:01:36.460]  mercury is good for kids we shouldn't be upset about it, I have that clip, you can just type
[01:01:36.460 --> 01:01:41.140]  it into YouTube and find it or when I have news across the country saying mercury is
[01:01:41.140 --> 01:01:47.860]  good for your brain, maybe I am the crazy person, maybe I am the bad man, you know I
[01:01:47.860 --> 01:01:51.660]  read all these government documents where they put additives in the plastic to feminize
[01:01:51.660 --> 01:01:55.620]  men and hyperfeminize women where the women end up getting breast cancer early and the
[01:01:55.620 --> 01:02:07.100]  men are basically women, the women are amazons who grow taller, live less, lifespans, that's
[01:02:07.100 --> 01:02:11.100]  the new system, little bitty men, these big giant women, I guess house slaves for the
[01:02:11.100 --> 01:02:15.820]  new world order, I guess that's just a re uptake on what the Romans did and what plantations
[01:02:15.820 --> 01:02:20.060]  did here in the United States, it's very very sad, the more I learn about anthropology,
[01:02:20.060 --> 01:02:24.340]  sociology, psychology, through the lens of the globalist master architects I can just
[01:02:24.340 --> 01:02:30.940]  see they've taken all their old slave systems and added on top of them, I haven't even gotten
[01:02:30.940 --> 01:02:45.340]  to the fact that terrorism is a giant hoax and that it's basically a psychological compulsion
[01:02:45.340 --> 01:02:55.940]  or a hypnotic suggestion, compulsion toward just the entire culture is just every show,
[01:02:55.940 --> 01:03:01.220]  cop show, terrorist are everywhere and people are now blurring that with reality and that's
[01:03:01.220 --> 01:03:06.540]  why I see newscast of police running checkpoints randomly with the TSA jerking families out
[01:03:06.540 --> 01:03:11.860]  and they're acting like every car has like 85 foot cobras breathing fire in them because
[01:03:11.860 --> 01:03:18.220]  the cops believe the world is a TV show, they just believe the total mass delusion, so I'm
[01:03:18.220 --> 01:03:21.380]  going to open the phones up and we got to break here in a moment and come back, I'm
[01:03:21.380 --> 01:03:24.900]  going to give the number out for everybody but that's when the phones are going to open
[01:03:24.900 --> 01:03:31.820]  up and I want to hear from the full audience but the phones are not open yet and I want
[01:03:31.820 --> 01:03:37.580]  to hear from you on all the subjects I've raised, there's another psychological warfare
[01:03:37.580 --> 01:03:43.780]  tactic here where they hype Iraq war for so many years when it finally happens even though
[01:03:43.780 --> 01:03:47.580]  you're against it and though they're lying about WMD's you're like hurry up and get it
[01:03:47.580 --> 01:03:53.540]  over with, it's kind of like a few times in school I'd have the bully in my last period
[01:03:53.540 --> 01:03:59.060]  class with me saying you know I'm going to beat you up after school and after a while
[01:03:59.060 --> 01:04:03.420]  you're like well I can't wait for the bell to ring for this to happen, I mean I remember
[01:04:03.420 --> 01:04:08.980]  being a few times being I guess in the lunch room a few periods before school ended or
[01:04:08.980 --> 01:04:16.340]  one time the guy was in my math class, last class I had of the day, I guess both times
[01:04:16.340 --> 01:04:20.580]  were in seventh grade or maybe eighth grade and I was just, I remember even though the
[01:04:20.580 --> 01:04:24.500]  kid had flunked in one case like three grades it was a lot bigger than me, he'd been threatening
[01:04:24.500 --> 01:04:29.580]  me at lunch I was kind of scared but I was tired of the day taking so long I was like
[01:04:29.580 --> 01:04:33.580]  hurry up then I was kind of happy to go out behind the school by the end of it I was
[01:04:33.580 --> 01:04:41.420]  finding him and it's the same psychological thing that they always hype it and hype it
[01:04:41.420 --> 01:04:45.780]  and hype it so it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy, again that's a psychological warfare
[01:04:45.780 --> 01:04:51.740]  tactic, a self-fulfilling prophecy where you just expect it to happen and so you almost
[01:04:51.740 --> 01:04:55.460]  acquiesce to it and I knew that was one of their psychological warfare tactics about
[01:04:55.460 --> 01:04:59.660]  a decade ago, looked it up in psychology and actually found it was one of their tactics.
[01:05:25.820 --> 01:05:30.460]  an endless supply of nutrient dense food for you and your family and here's the best part

[01:08:27.140 --> 01:08:33.980]  the web friday but it was and i saw comments on some neocon blogs that reposted our article
[01:08:33.980 --> 01:08:41.860]  saying jones is making this up the third paragraph is a link to the u n and to the desert news
[01:08:41.860 --> 01:08:48.460]  mainstream news with the headline u n leaders consider world tax to fund social protection
[01:08:48.460 --> 01:08:55.060]  services oh you gotta help women with the u n raping forces i mean every u n pcb force
[01:08:55.060 --> 01:08:58.540]  out there is known for kidnapping kids you name it i mean they have the worst record
[01:08:58.540 --> 01:09:02.780]  out there but it's always it's for the women and children we need a global tax and global
[01:09:02.780 --> 01:09:06.900]  regulations and a global court run by the big mega banks that have bankrupted all your
[01:09:06.900 --> 01:09:12.260]  countries through derivatives and and and then even on my own website but then even
[01:09:12.260 --> 01:09:19.700]  on other big neocon sites where they post my articles they post our articles and then
[01:09:19.700 --> 01:09:25.780]  they call us liars i mean there is a world government it's unelected it's out of control
[01:09:25.780 --> 01:09:31.980]  and its goal is hegemonic control so that once it's got that control to reduce our population

[01:12:17.700 --> 01:12:23.500]  adopted in by the pentagon and by the white house and then they have the quotes here you
[01:12:23.500 --> 01:12:29.700]  might want to go read them where they say we need to have a provocation whatever it takes
[01:12:29.700 --> 01:12:33.620]  to say that i ran attacked us that's what we need to get this new war launched and sells

[01:13:02.540 --> 01:13:07.700]  thing it would be far more preferable the united states could cite as an iranian provocation
[01:13:07.700 --> 01:13:12.300]  justification for the air strikes before launching them clearly the more outrageous the more deadly
[01:13:12.300 --> 01:13:15.380]  and the more unprovoked the iranian action the better off the united states would be
[01:13:15.380 --> 01:13:22.540]  i mean this is all thinly thinly veiled but i thought i would go further before i got
[01:13:22.540 --> 01:13:27.260]  back into that here's curts latest article today us and israel set stage for false flag
[01:13:27.260 --> 01:13:32.340]  attack on iran days after clapper puts out this report saying we need a big provocation
[01:13:32.340 --> 01:13:38.780]  we need to be hit and hit hard he comes out publicly not in a white paper to the insiders
[01:13:38.780 --> 01:13:42.820]  that's public but i think we're animals and don't read it are you an animal do you do
[01:13:42.820 --> 01:13:49.780]  you read what they say and he he says oh my gosh al qaeda with iran of course the two

[01:13:56.820 --> 01:14:01.940]  and we got to give all our rights up and iran's going to hit us preemptively yeah exactly
[01:14:01.940 --> 01:14:05.940]  what iran wants is to be attacked that's why they've let israel the u.s. and england blow
[01:14:05.940 --> 01:14:12.500]  up power plants military bases generals police stations and dams and launch stucks net attacks
[01:14:12.500 --> 01:14:17.860]  iran has laid there and taken it all but now oh my gosh they're going to blow stuff up here

[01:22:02.220 --> 01:22:09.180]  and november 2012 i'm demonstrating that he's a leader who can command confidence in short
[01:22:09.180 --> 01:22:13.420]  of a new 9 11 event or oklahoma city i can't think of how he could do that what do you
[01:22:13.420 --> 01:22:20.020]  think war with iran will be an october surprise i mean don't act like well why would government

[01:33:48.060 --> 01:33:54.060]  i won't get to it fully here tonight so i'll get to it tomorrow or the next day uh but um

[01:34:00.460 --> 01:34:06.620]  out on air but we like to show it to you from the centers for disease control uh world almanac
[01:34:06.620 --> 01:34:13.340]  and others and scientific american uh we have the number one cause of deaths down to the least
[01:34:13.340 --> 01:34:21.420]  likely and terrorism depending on which gradient you look at uh is way way way down the line in
[01:34:21.420 --> 01:34:29.500]  the 30s honey bees deer jumping out in front of you they kill more people uh than uh terrorist
[01:34:30.300 --> 01:34:37.260]  and no one can deny so let's just say the terrorists are real okay uh should we give up our whole way
[01:34:37.260 --> 01:34:43.020]  of life and have people grabbing our genitals to get on airplanes and confiscating gold out of our
[01:34:44.140 --> 01:34:50.380]  i saw it like i think i sent it to you john or maybe i sent it to watson for an article there was
[01:34:50.380 --> 01:34:58.220]  something like eight tsa people arrested just in one day stealing out of bags and then i saw some
[01:34:58.220 --> 01:35:01.980]  other crazy number where it's like hundreds and hundreds of them are getting caught and they're
[01:35:01.980 --> 01:35:07.180]  like raping people in parking lots and pedophilia and i mean it's it's like on a daily basis
[01:35:07.180 --> 01:35:12.620]  they're getting caught and busted i mean just type in tsa into a search engine click news
[01:35:12.620 --> 01:35:19.260]  and it was just in fact do it right now it was just type tsa and then click news on the evil google
[01:35:19.260 --> 01:35:25.980]  and right there it's just wall to wall with the crimes they're committing and pleading guilty to
[01:35:25.980 --> 01:35:31.740]  and robbing people i mean who protects us from the protectors we'll see our bill of rights and
[01:35:31.740 --> 01:35:37.020]  constitution does because the founders knew statistically in history look at all those
[01:35:37.020 --> 01:35:42.140]  articles there's hundreds of them they knew statistically that government always uses the
[01:35:42.140 --> 01:35:47.580]  excuse of keeping you safe and always becomes the great abuser it's the great danger governments killed
[01:35:47.580 --> 01:35:53.980]  over 250 million people in the 20th century alone it's the number one cause of unnatural death
[01:35:55.340 --> 01:35:59.820]  but they've got you scared of something that kills less people than champagne courts that's
[01:35:59.820 --> 01:36:06.380]  what i'm saying any way you slice it it's not a real threat it's destroying our bill of rights
[01:36:06.380 --> 01:36:11.100]  and constitution it's being used to overthrow our republic and all over the world is being used to
[01:36:11.100 --> 01:36:19.980]  take liberties it is a hoax and a scam now there it is average number of deaths per year in the us
[01:36:19.980 --> 01:36:28.380]  being washed 53 dogs 31 spiders 6.5 rattlesnake 5.5 mountain lion one alligator 0.3 bear 0.5
[01:36:28.380 --> 01:36:34.860]  scorpion 0.5 we just go through the numbers oh boy you just go look at the numbers for yourself
[01:36:34.860 --> 01:36:42.060]  but every movie i try to rent is about terrorist science fiction current whatever tv shows it's
[01:36:42.060 --> 01:36:47.820]  all brainwashing all right let's go to your calls christen um maryland you're on the air go ahead
[01:36:50.140 --> 01:36:54.620]  finally yes sir i've only got a minute so i'll try to make this brief but just to let you know
[01:36:54.620 --> 01:36:58.060]  that i've learned so much from you throughout all the years and i try to apply it every day
[01:36:58.060 --> 01:37:03.740]  day to day but it's so hard the work that you've got to do it's like i feel for you every day
[01:37:03.740 --> 01:37:08.300]  you've got to get up there and just steer the herd or they're just so mentally immediate
[01:37:08.300 --> 01:37:12.860]  decided drones it's just almost impossible but they're brain damage victims from chemical and
[01:37:12.860 --> 01:37:17.900]  psychological warfare and biological warfare on record and you don't need to feel for me brother
[01:37:17.900 --> 01:37:23.180]  i'm trying to survive just like you are this is not a heroic deed it's a survival mechanism deed
[01:37:23.180 --> 01:37:29.100]  but remember think how far we've come how many people are waking up now uh incredible things
[01:37:29.100 --> 01:37:34.220]  are happening but people are in a trance it's up to us to wake them up go ahead i know i don't
[01:37:34.220 --> 01:37:38.780]  mean we go through this redundantly daily but what it comes down to that when you finally do
[01:37:38.780 --> 01:37:43.580]  engage them and you catch them on something then they look at you like they have this split second
[01:37:43.580 --> 01:37:50.460]  glare in their eye like it's true but i can't believe it so well there's such cowards that
[01:37:50.460 --> 01:37:56.220]  they can't believe it's happening that's why almost all women when a guy comes up with a gunner and
[01:37:56.220 --> 01:38:01.340]  knifes is getting my car even though statistically they're dead and they know they're dead they get
[01:38:01.340 --> 01:38:06.380]  in the car just like people in nazi germany ran into those pits to be shot they'd watch one group
[01:38:06.380 --> 01:38:11.580]  run in with their kids and be shot and they'd do it themselves and even even hold their hat and and
[01:38:11.580 --> 01:38:16.380]  curtsy to the nazi because it was just like i'm going to be polite about this i'm going to submit
[01:38:16.380 --> 01:38:22.220]  to authority well here's the deal i'm not doing it i see it and i'm warning the people and it
[01:38:22.220 --> 01:38:26.620]  doesn't take a majority to beat this scum we're trying to fix things peacefully but we're not
[01:38:26.620 --> 01:38:30.860]  going to their death camps people can't laugh about that now they're on record saying they'll
[01:38:30.860 --> 01:38:36.540]  arrest citizens and kill us whenever they want no judge no jury the government is lawless and
[01:38:36.540 --> 01:38:42.540]  treason filled go ahead well it's just like you've been as you've painstakingly delineated
[01:38:42.540 --> 01:38:47.500]  meticulously i mean ten years ago even i probably would have to all right because i've always been
[01:38:47.500 --> 01:38:54.220]  prone to the conspiracy theories quote unquote i mean questioning known liars being conspiracy
[01:38:54.220 --> 01:38:58.540]  theorist is that they brought a stake out and it was totally pink and uncooked you said that's not
[01:38:58.540 --> 01:39:03.420]  been cooked i wanted it medium and they say sir it's been cooked and it's raw with maggots coming
[01:39:03.420 --> 01:39:10.620]  out exactly thinking thinking is conspiracy theory now okay sorry go ahead you come out
[01:39:10.620 --> 01:39:15.580]  ten years later i mean it's like either you are either a prophet or you just saw the writing on
[01:39:15.580 --> 01:39:20.460]  a wall so well you interpret it it's just beyond no i told you there'd be military on the streets
[01:39:20.460 --> 01:39:24.300]  that they'd be saying they'd secretly arrest citizens i told you how they'd censor the internet
[01:39:24.300 --> 01:39:29.180]  with a cocktail of systems and it's not because i'm smart sir they all wrote white papers i've got
[01:39:29.180 --> 01:39:35.980]  ran corporation brookings and cfr all saying what they're going to do boy a terror attack would
[01:39:35.980 --> 01:39:42.700]  sure be nice we'll say low right wing groups work with al qaeda and arrest them all boy president
[01:39:42.700 --> 01:39:49.020]  it's your help if that would happen alex has gone to the point where and i don't need to tell you
[01:39:49.020 --> 01:39:53.500]  you know you know you're you're you're head and shoulders above of anyone else but i'm even concerned
[01:39:53.500 --> 01:39:57.820]  about making this phone call to you in a way i hear you and i appreciate your call chris listen
[01:39:57.820 --> 01:40:02.780]  you got to get through that fear yes they're announcing the censorship and the secret arrest

[01:40:08.140 --> 01:40:14.220]  the military the police are waking up okay and and and you know what you just got to stop caring
[01:40:14.220 --> 01:40:23.660]  the answer to 1984 is 1776 our four bearers were rag tag three percent of the population
[01:40:23.660 --> 01:40:30.540]  on record were anti redcoat and anti abuse by the end of the war they were five percent okay
[01:40:30.540 --> 01:40:37.820]  three percent and they and they and they said you know what we're standing up against an army
[01:40:37.820 --> 01:40:44.300]  who the french and the spanish and the russians and the arabs nobody'd ever beat the british
[01:40:44.300 --> 01:40:50.940]  military okay until they ran into the wild british of the colonies mixed in with the germans
[01:40:50.940 --> 01:40:55.340]  and everybody else and the point is is they and they got their butt kicked over seven years
[01:40:55.340 --> 01:41:01.900]  because we didn't give up okay the minute we lose is when we're afraid fear is the enemy

[01:41:08.380 --> 01:41:11.900]  there's no other way to go because they're the other ways eugenics and death
[01:41:11.900 --> 01:41:18.220]  okay uh austin in oregon you're on the air go ahead hey alex great show god bless go ahead uh

[01:41:24.460 --> 01:41:29.980]  the whole global death cult thing uh what do you thought about that kind of scenario happening at
[01:41:29.980 --> 01:41:36.700]  like the olympics of london or any kind of bio attack really i mean it seems like it's kind of in
[01:41:36.700 --> 01:41:41.820]  the cards still and uh you can write about a lot of other kind of false flag things going on but
[01:41:41.820 --> 01:41:46.220]  what do you think about that kind of bio attack happening well here's the deal by exposing a
[01:41:46.220 --> 01:41:51.740]  massive bio attack and then it's in the cards that can back them off just like they've said war with
[01:41:51.740 --> 01:41:56.140]  iran is imminent for a year but now a hundred thousand us troops are massing the missiles are
[01:41:56.140 --> 01:42:00.060]  getting in place and now the secretary defense said yeah israel's getting ready to hit them
[01:42:00.060 --> 01:42:04.940]  in the next four months but then when we're anti-war they say be quiet conspiracy theorist
[01:42:04.940 --> 01:42:10.140]  there's no plan to hit iran kind of like last week obama came out and said yeah my drones are
[01:42:10.140 --> 01:42:14.220]  killing people and they said that's classified don't talk about it it's well known the drones
[01:42:14.220 --> 01:42:19.820]  are doing that they mean it's classified three speeches classified don't talk about it as if
[01:42:19.820 --> 01:42:25.020]  the president is some kept minion and that's what the system's trying to do is train people that you
[01:42:25.020 --> 01:42:28.780]  have no free speech to even speak out against the drones because that's national security
[01:42:30.060 --> 01:42:35.980]  but but but but here here's what concerns me all over the place brother they're hyping the the
[01:42:35.980 --> 01:42:41.580]  airborne abola the airborne mouse pox stuff that kills over 90 of those that come in contact with it
[01:42:41.580 --> 01:42:46.860]  and admitting that governments our own governments produced it so they're kind of introducing the
[01:42:46.860 --> 01:42:53.420]  attack to people and they always do that ahead of releasing it so they're already bio attacking us
[01:42:53.420 --> 01:42:57.260]  at small levels but they could go with a hot bio attack that kills billions
[01:43:01.900 --> 01:43:07.500]  hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone this is our last chance
[01:43:07.500 --> 01:43:12.700]  to not relive history as we're finishing off this agenda that we're pulling the rug from
[01:43:12.700 --> 01:43:18.860]  underneath the Americans at home have tremendous influence on our president in congress and they
[01:43:18.860 --> 01:43:25.580]  really are calling the shots i think it's incumbent upon all of us as american citizens to pay attention
[01:43:25.580 --> 01:43:31.420]  full of the republic identifies the enemies of our nation the criminal offshore cartel hell
[01:43:31.420 --> 01:43:36.460]  bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government tim geithner
[01:43:36.460 --> 01:43:41.180]  Bernanke the arsonists they're asking for more matches and the congress is saying who do we make
[01:43:41.180 --> 01:43:47.020]  the check out to today seems like nobody does care and right now in washington dc we have seen

[01:47:50.540 --> 01:47:56.780]  to caucus Tuesday night for ron paul yes if you don't know where your caucus location is
[01:47:57.340 --> 01:48:04.140]  just google your county republican party website and they'll have all the information there in terms
[01:48:04.140 --> 01:48:10.380]  of how to you know find put your address in and get your precinct number and then the address of the
[01:48:10.380 --> 01:48:19.340]  caucus okay so that having been said the driver behind my calling today alex is that i generally
[01:48:19.340 --> 01:48:26.620]  listen to your show on my cell phone in the car i've got a bluetooth and yesterday i was driving
[01:48:26.620 --> 01:48:36.780]  around doing errands all day and the number to your telephone you know call to listen to your
[01:48:36.780 --> 01:48:42.700]  telephone call was jammed well i know there's a bunch of systems where we have people can call
[01:48:42.700 --> 01:48:47.500]  and listen to it to numbers i know we've got that it might have been down yesterday and i appreciate
[01:48:47.500 --> 01:48:54.380]  your call but we also have the free um uh droid and iphone apps that are at the listen section
[01:48:54.380 --> 01:48:58.460]  of info wars.com so we'll have to look into that it might not have been jammed it might have just
[01:48:58.460 --> 01:49:02.540]  been a technical difficulty but they're openly calling for censorship and twitter and google are
[01:49:02.540 --> 01:49:08.060]  now saying they'll censor under any government request no judge no jury it's very serious so
[01:49:08.060 --> 01:49:13.420]  thank you so much for the call michael in texas no michelle in texas go ahead you're on the air
[01:49:15.580 --> 01:49:22.540]  oh hi alex can you hear me yes i can welcome hi um well i just want to ask you what do you think
[01:49:22.540 --> 01:49:27.660]  about the nevada caucuses last night i mean they haven't even reported all the votes yet
[01:49:28.700 --> 01:49:32.620]  yeah there was a fraud in iowa fraud in south carolina certified and confirmed
[01:49:33.260 --> 01:49:39.500]  and ron paul many polls was in first place there and there is massive election fraud i told people
[01:49:39.500 --> 01:49:42.860]  just because he wins all the straw polls and in many national polls is number one they're
[01:49:42.860 --> 01:49:47.260]  going to try to steal it people say well then why should ron paul run because he's injecting real
[01:49:47.260 --> 01:49:52.460]  ideas and it's it's building the movement for liberty but i mean we're in deep deep trouble look
[01:49:52.460 --> 01:49:56.780]  at how they gave him least time in the debates look at how they said he can't win i mean they're
[01:49:56.780 --> 01:50:03.820]  engaged in every trick they can uh and uh yeah i mean we haven't gotten the proof yet in nevada
[01:50:03.820 --> 01:50:11.340]  of fraud but we got it in iowa and south carolina yeah i mean i basically sat here on the cnn
[01:50:11.340 --> 01:50:19.820]  website and i watched that last late night caucus and 183 votes went to ron paul and
[01:50:19.820 --> 01:50:25.580]  i'm just me and all the other people on facebook page we blow it we blow it up we repost all the
[01:50:25.580 --> 01:50:30.460]  pictures every day we're doing the money bombs like we're doing everything we can and it just
[01:50:30.460 --> 01:50:37.500]  blows my mind that that one caucus that many people showed up i mean imagine the other counties
[01:50:37.500 --> 01:50:43.020]  and precinct i mean i'm sorry imagine all the other precincts that had that type of turnout for
[01:50:43.020 --> 01:50:48.860]  ron well look i mean here's the deal election fraud has been caught all over the country
[01:50:48.860 --> 01:50:54.060]  the voting machine systems are built where you can't find out and and prove anything
[01:50:54.060 --> 01:50:58.780]  they're designed for fraud that's come out in congressional testimony and people have to wake
[01:50:58.780 --> 01:51:03.820]  up to just how bad this is and get paper ballots back that are counted precinct by precinct and
[01:51:03.820 --> 01:51:10.300]  then tallyed properly but even iowa had that and they admittedly cheated on that and have now
[01:51:10.300 --> 01:51:15.660]  nullified the iowa caucuses and say we don't know who won we're going to give it to santorum
[01:51:15.660 --> 01:51:20.700]  and and that's hidden in plain view we're just trained to accept anything these days it's it's
[01:51:20.700 --> 01:51:25.100]  it's crazy i appreciate your call we have a private fellow reserve that controls our money
[01:51:25.100 --> 01:51:31.820]  we didn't have it till 1913 uh let's talk to bill in georgia you're on the air bill oh yeah good
[01:51:31.820 --> 01:51:37.900]  evening hi how you doing good man good good um hey kudos to you i really appreciate everything

[01:51:42.540 --> 01:51:49.020]  almighty uh steroid bowl is going they're like the other color faith not fair that's what we need
[01:51:49.020 --> 01:51:54.860]  to have more of and um you know i was wondering what were you thinking about that uh obama
[01:51:54.860 --> 01:52:01.820]  disqualification of disqualification trial here in uh lana well i mean he's in contempt he does
[01:52:01.820 --> 01:52:06.220]  have a fake social security number that's been proven the kenyan government says that there's
[01:52:06.220 --> 01:52:10.860]  a record of him being born there but it was removed it's cut out of the book i mean george
[01:52:10.860 --> 01:52:16.220]  w bush in the election had the secret service go over there and that's been confirmed and it
[01:52:16.220 --> 01:52:22.060]  wasn't public it took a foyer request to get that i mean uh the state department ruled his dad was
[01:52:22.060 --> 01:52:27.820]  not his dad and kicked him out of the country his dad looked nothing like him i mean yeah no obama
[01:52:27.820 --> 01:52:32.860]  is an enigma wrapped in a riddle who reads off a teleprompter i appreciate your call uh let's go
[01:52:32.860 --> 01:52:39.740]  ahead and talk to john in texas moving quick here john welcome hello alex hey buddy hey good to talk
[01:52:39.740 --> 01:52:46.460]  to you i just wanted to thank you for waking up as many people as you have you know i paid a high
[01:52:46.460 --> 01:52:55.340]  price for being awakened and um i've been ostracized from my family uh because of that and that's
[01:52:55.340 --> 01:52:58.940]  unfortunate wow i don't believe in freedom and debate in the first amendment i thought they
[01:52:58.940 --> 01:53:04.220]  were americans oh they're they're they're agricultural people but they are so totally brainwashed
[01:53:04.860 --> 01:53:09.900]  that they just don't get it well you know they call that uh well there's a couple different
[01:53:09.900 --> 01:53:16.620]  syndromes but it's the stock home syndrome and uh it happens in every culture people really get
[01:53:16.620 --> 01:53:21.900]  comfortable and think the governments they're sweet daddy that loves them and and i would just
[01:53:21.900 --> 01:53:27.740]  keep working on your family well i'm vocally passionate about good science a healthy environment
[01:53:27.740 --> 01:53:33.980]  responsible informed educators non-gmo food production oh they love gmo why don't you give
[01:53:33.980 --> 01:53:39.660]  them all the thousands of studies it sterilizes every rat they feed it to i had i had an argument
[01:53:39.660 --> 01:53:48.220]  that's two thanksgivings ago with a phd and a phd candidate about gmo's and i was basically told
[01:53:48.220 --> 01:53:55.500]  to leave oh i know they get on listen they get on pattle good then don't let them
[01:53:55.500 --> 01:54:00.380]  door hit them on the rear end i mean look find people that are your spiritual family
[01:54:00.380 --> 01:54:05.820]  who are awake i mean this happened in nazi germany this happened in 1776 here in the us
[01:54:05.820 --> 01:54:11.500]  this is going to happen again and uh you know people especially salesmen will tell you families
[01:54:11.500 --> 01:54:16.540]  the hardest to sell on anything you could be selling snow cones in hell and people wouldn't
[01:54:16.540 --> 01:54:22.700]  buy it if you were family so don't feel bad brother and i support you i bought your tapes
[01:54:22.700 --> 01:54:28.860]  and i'm a member and hang in there and i know i'm preaching to the choir all i can say is we
[01:54:28.860 --> 01:54:33.260]  need to organize to the point where we can be effective no i hear you but you're not just
[01:54:33.260 --> 01:54:38.700]  talking to the choir we know we have our regular listeners we've got computer systems and analytics
[01:54:38.700 --> 01:54:45.740]  and numbers and breakdowns we got 15 million listeners or website visitors total views and
[01:54:45.740 --> 01:54:53.660]  listens a week now growing now three four months it'll be like 18 million but the point is about
[01:54:53.660 --> 01:55:00.060]  35 percent of that is new every week they come through most of them never come back again
[01:55:00.060 --> 01:55:05.980]  but a you know a small percent i think it's like six percent or so each month seven percent
[01:55:05.980 --> 01:55:11.740]  that sticks so 35 new every month and we just keep getting bigger they do they come by
[01:55:12.540 --> 01:55:18.620]  they don't you know that they listen they check it out they leave but some stay and so that's
[01:55:18.620 --> 01:55:23.820]  how it works i mean that look look look look when the depression continues when the breakdown of
[01:55:23.820 --> 01:55:30.220]  society happens when all this accelerates they'll remember what you said who's up next here
