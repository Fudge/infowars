[00:00.000 --> 00:08.960]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are live broadcasting Worldwide Sunday, the 25th day of March, 2018.
[00:08.960 --> 00:10.520]  Owen Schroyer's here with me.
[00:10.520 --> 00:14.720]  We're ready to kick some globalists, but he was downtown in Austin, facing the cult
[00:14.720 --> 00:18.200]  like marchers chanting, we have the power, we will ban your guns.
[00:18.200 --> 00:19.200]  It's on video.
[00:19.200 --> 00:20.200]  It's all coming up.
[00:20.200 --> 00:21.200]  Hey, here's the news.
[00:21.200 --> 00:24.680]  They're trying to act all powerful and saying, we're shaking in our boots.
[00:24.680 --> 00:25.680]  No.
[00:25.680 --> 00:30.880]  This is why the libertarians, the pro-humans, the populist are awaiting the globalists,
[00:30.880 --> 00:34.480]  and they may have a bunch of Department of Education brainwashed people out there marching
[00:34.480 --> 00:37.680]  paid for by Soros, but the sleeping giant is awake.
[00:37.680 --> 00:39.760]  Here's John Bown reporting first.
[00:39.760 --> 00:43.160]  What separates mainstream media from blatant propaganda?
[00:43.160 --> 00:48.880]  800 marches are planned for Saturday, from Bismarck to Salt Lake City, Memphis to Springfield
[00:48.880 --> 00:56.120]  Virginia, and everywhere in between, children now taking on a very adult topic, politics,
[00:56.120 --> 00:58.800]  and hoping they can teach the grown-ups a lesson.
[00:58.800 --> 01:04.160]  The lopsided coverage of the March for Life was anything but objective, but don't take
[01:04.160 --> 01:05.440]  my word for it.
[01:05.440 --> 01:10.960]  Here's Gunn Grabber and Chief Senator Dianne Feinstein from California with more.
[01:10.960 --> 01:14.600]  Let's bring in a prominent member of the United States, Senator Dianne Feinstein of
[01:14.600 --> 01:19.600]  California, she's in San Francisco right now, Dianne, thank you for joining us.
[01:19.600 --> 01:21.400]  What's it like out there today?
[01:21.400 --> 01:23.200]  It's wild here in Washington.
[01:23.200 --> 01:27.280]  Well, it's the first day of spring.
[01:27.280 --> 01:28.280]  People are here.
[01:28.280 --> 01:31.960]  And we have a Democrat, Dan Amaze, George Soros pays for the buses.
[01:31.960 --> 01:38.040]  People to know is that we have introduced an assault weapons ban.
[01:38.040 --> 01:41.720]  My office wrote it, but we have 30 co-sponsors.
[01:41.720 --> 01:42.720]  It's in the judiciary.
[01:42.720 --> 01:46.320]  They go, people hate us, well let's fund a couple million kids, force out of school
[01:46.320 --> 01:49.720]  to come do this, pay for their hotels, everything, and they'll make us look young.
[01:49.720 --> 01:52.840]  We don't have a single republic.
[01:52.840 --> 01:58.600]  And you've got to get the military weapon off of the streets and out of the schools
[01:58.600 --> 01:59.600]  and out of circulation.
[01:59.600 --> 02:00.600]  I deeply believe that.
[02:00.600 --> 02:02.100]  Out of the victim's arm and son's.
[02:02.100 --> 02:06.560]  Even the presentation during the March for Life rally in Washington, D.C. subjected
[02:06.560 --> 02:10.480]  the participants with no-thigh-enemy-style expositions.
[02:10.480 --> 02:14.480]  They use their schools to teach children that their president is another Hitler.
[02:14.480 --> 02:15.480]  Hitler took the guns.
[02:15.480 --> 02:16.480]  Stalin took the guns.
[02:16.480 --> 02:20.680]  If you try to take our firearms, it doesn't matter how many lemmings you get out there
[02:20.680 --> 02:24.880]  on the street, begging for them to have their guns taken, we will not relinquish them.
[02:24.880 --> 02:29.560]  They use their movie stars and singers and comedy shows and award shows to repeat their
[02:29.560 --> 02:31.800]  narrative over and over again.
[02:31.800 --> 02:33.880]  What matters is who the enemy is.
[02:33.880 --> 02:36.080]  They're the no-gun people, period.
[02:36.080 --> 02:42.960]  Listen up, you might have met our fresh-faced flower child, President, we need Ivy League
[02:42.960 --> 02:43.960]  friends.
[02:43.960 --> 02:57.120]  The only truly free people who have ever walked this earth have been armed people.
[02:57.120 --> 03:10.520]  This is too powerful, I'm going to play this coming up.
[03:10.520 --> 03:12.040]  They're jumping the shark here.
[03:12.040 --> 03:17.320]  They force buss, a bunch of these brain dead, you know, democratic party children, and they
[03:17.320 --> 03:21.880]  show them us saying we'll never turn it in, and they got hogged up there with an armband
[03:21.880 --> 03:24.960]  and they rest up and go, and we're going to take you on, you're going to lose.
[03:24.960 --> 03:28.640]  You're trying to launch like a malice army, this is going to completely blow up in their
[03:28.640 --> 03:29.640]  face, Owen.
[03:29.640 --> 03:33.960]  I don't think Soros and all the doddering Hollywood people get that yet, I'm just looking
[03:33.960 --> 03:38.200]  at this and my gut tells me this ain't going to fly, this dog ain't going to hunt.
[03:38.200 --> 03:44.040]  They do seem to be losing their sense of reality as far as what the average individual is thinking,
[03:44.040 --> 03:48.160]  but Alex, if 25% of these young students that they're trying to brainwash right now, if
[03:48.160 --> 03:54.800]  just 25% of them are like me and when they reach the age about 23, they fight the brainwashing,
[03:54.800 --> 03:58.880]  they recognize the brainwashing by researching, and they realize more kids die every week
[03:58.880 --> 04:03.640]  in pools that die all year from mass shooting, over 50 kids die a week grounding, it's only
[04:03.640 --> 04:05.880]  50 something in mass shootings, that's still terrible.
[04:05.880 --> 04:10.480]  I mean, this is like one of the rarest things, but it's game over for them, it's game over
[04:10.480 --> 04:15.520]  for them because a lot of these children, a lot of this youth is going to wake up and
[04:15.520 --> 04:20.240]  they're going to change their political views, that's just what you expect, the average person
[04:20.240 --> 04:21.240]  changes their political views.
[04:21.240 --> 04:26.360]  I was just at six flags, I was just at six flags yesterday and today with my daughters
[04:26.360 --> 04:28.320]  and five of their friends.
[04:28.320 --> 04:35.160]  I had Hispanic, black, old, young, I got mobbed at the hotel, mobbed at six flags, I shot
[04:35.160 --> 04:39.240]  video, we're going to have some tomorrow, no one disagreed, it was incredible, they were
[04:39.240 --> 04:42.400]  all, they were like, we've broken the conditioning, we understand, we know it's really rare to
[04:42.400 --> 04:45.760]  get shot, we know they want our guns, we know they're globalist, we know it's Soros, and
[04:45.760 --> 04:48.840]  it was just like high five, high five, yeah, we're winning.
[04:48.840 --> 04:51.560]  So people love you Alex, you need to go out more.
[04:51.560 --> 04:55.280]  No, no, they love you, and the thing is they love freedom, they love freedom, and that's
[04:55.280 --> 05:00.200]  why they're announcing on MSNBC, surrender we've won, surrender we've won.
[05:00.200 --> 05:04.840]  Fuel your body with carnivore, the new digestive enzyme product by InfoWars Life.
[05:04.840 --> 05:08.800]  Digestive enzymes assist in the digestive process and increase the bioavailability of
[05:08.800 --> 05:12.160]  nutrients by breaking down foods into easily absorbable components.
[05:12.160 --> 05:16.440]  They also help prevent discomfort from a digestion caused by fermentation of undigested food
[05:16.440 --> 05:21.280]  particles in the gut, digestive enzyme production declines as we age, carnivore is filled with
[05:21.280 --> 05:26.280]  digestive enzymes like those naturally present in the body, enjoy the full potential of protein
[05:26.280 --> 05:31.680]  rich foods again, you can eat protein heavy foods now, while minimizing the later indigestion
[05:31.680 --> 05:36.200]  and discomfort commonly associated with high meat diets, just one pill with every high
[05:36.200 --> 05:41.000]  protein meal helps increase the bioavailability and absorption of amino acids, the building
[05:41.000 --> 05:43.360]  blocks to your muscles.
[05:43.360 --> 05:47.800]  Carnivore also contains digestive enzymes to help digest fats and carbohydrates, so you
[05:47.800 --> 05:53.200]  can fully digest all types of meals, don't let a meal go to waste, use carnivore by InfoWars
[05:53.200 --> 06:17.040]  Life, head to infowarslife.com and secure your bottle now, that's infowarslife.com.
[06:17.040 --> 06:26.200]  From deep in the heart of FEMA Region 6, Austin, Texas, transmitting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[06:26.200 --> 06:32.200]  And Owen Troyer, I'm not going to host the second hour, I've got a bunch of girls that
[06:32.200 --> 06:36.640]  are visiting with my daughters, I've got to deliver home by 6 or 7 o'clock, but you're
[06:36.640 --> 06:41.160]  going to be hosting the first hour here, I just went down to Six Flags down to San Antonio
[06:41.160 --> 06:47.600]  Fiesta, Texas, got mobbed by Americans of every race, color, and creed, who are all the human
[06:47.600 --> 06:50.720]  race, that are awake, and all of them were like, Alex, we're not turning our guns in,
[06:50.720 --> 06:55.360]  we know it's Soros, we know it's the globalist, we understand it's a takeover, we understand
[06:55.360 --> 07:01.040]  Trump's trying to turn the economy back on, it was amazing, but Owen, the bizarre article,
[07:01.040 --> 07:06.800]  well it's bizarre images put out by Hog on infowars.com, where Hog now wears a purple
[07:06.800 --> 07:14.920]  armband like the Nazis, and he's there saying, old people are effing bad, we're going to
[07:14.920 --> 07:21.480]  get them, and then YouTube bans the video for bullying when it's David Hog saying, he's
[07:21.480 --> 07:27.800]  this huge public figure, force fed on every TV in the U.S. at the Soros funded marches,
[07:27.800 --> 07:33.640]  but then if we talk about the four students out of 3,000 that are anti-gun at that school,
[07:33.640 --> 07:37.880]  the others get banned from CNN, banned from this NBC, they say they've been banned, CNN's
[07:37.880 --> 07:42.160]  been caught having fake town halls, if we point out that Soros and the Democrats are
[07:42.160 --> 07:46.400]  funding this, which they admit they're doing, they lie and say that we're saying no shooting
[07:46.400 --> 07:53.040]  happened, or they're crisis actors, and literally thousands of articles a week saying ban infowars,
[07:53.040 --> 07:57.520]  this is an attack on the First Amendment as well, this is their biggest assault, I wrote
[07:57.520 --> 08:01.920]  some headlines for the live feeds on the internet today, Facebook's headline, biggest offensive
[08:01.920 --> 08:07.160]  in history, launched against the First and Second Amendment, live coverage of Soros anti-gun
[08:07.160 --> 08:12.000]  marches, he is admittedly, the women's marches, the group funding it, he funds 92% according
[08:12.000 --> 08:15.280]  to federal election commission numbers of that, so 90 plus percent of this is funded
[08:15.280 --> 08:22.640]  by him, periscope, Democrats openly chant, it must have typoed there, Democrats openly
[08:22.640 --> 08:30.040]  change, it's chant, we have the power, we will get the guns at rallies nationwide, Democrats
[08:30.040 --> 08:37.520]  openly chant, we have the power, we will ban the guns, we will ban the guns at rallies
[08:37.520 --> 08:45.240]  nationwide, and tonight, Stormy's 60 minutes set for Trump sex, Democrats announced revolution
[08:45.240 --> 08:49.800]  against the Second Amendment, this is how massive the point in history we are right
[08:49.800 --> 08:50.800]  now.
[08:50.800 --> 08:56.240]  No, it's crazy that you have mainstream news, what was once a very highly respected program,
[08:56.240 --> 09:00.360]  60 minutes now bringing on porn stars that are basically just promoting themselves, CNN
[09:00.360 --> 09:04.120]  doing the same thing, when nobody really cares about that, if you want to upset Trump's
[09:04.120 --> 09:08.480]  base, if they were smart, they'd be attacking the latest budget, but they're not even smart.
[09:08.480 --> 09:12.720]  Back to David Hogg, I don't know what his motivation is, Alex, I don't know if he-
[09:12.720 --> 09:17.920]  That's the high school senior that calls me a piece of crap in all these names, and YouTube
[09:17.920 --> 09:22.200]  bans, any videos that criticize me, including videos of him flipping out saying old people
[09:22.200 --> 09:23.600]  are pieces of crap.
[09:23.600 --> 09:28.560]  But that's a typical view when you kind of reach that age, I mean, when you reach a certain
[09:28.560 --> 09:32.440]  age, you start to resent older people, you start to resent authority, you start to resent
[09:32.440 --> 09:37.480]  the establishment, and you kind of form your own way of rebelling, and David Hogg, I don't
[09:37.480 --> 09:41.440]  know if that's his motivation, if he's really organic, or if he's being spoon fed these
[09:41.440 --> 09:46.760]  lines by the Democrat Party, or his FBI father, or CNN mother, or whatever, but the average
[09:46.760 --> 09:50.720]  high school that feels that way changes their mind by the time they're 22.
[09:50.720 --> 09:56.520]  And so they think that they can get these people to have a concrete view against guns,
[09:56.520 --> 10:00.720]  a concrete view against America, but it's gonna change, Alex, they're gonna experience
[10:00.720 --> 10:01.720]  things, they're gonna-
[10:01.720 --> 10:06.160]  But studies show most generation Z are libertarian or conservative now, because almost all their
[10:06.160 --> 10:09.880]  teachers, almost all their professors are beating them over the head with globalist
[10:09.880 --> 10:10.880]  ideology.
[10:10.880 --> 10:12.240]  So that's the next wave.
[10:12.240 --> 10:18.120]  So the wave of David Hogg is like their final wave of the establishment was the NRA, the
[10:18.120 --> 10:23.480]  establishment was the conservatives, and so the establishment's Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan,
[10:23.480 --> 10:27.320]  George Soros, the globalists that have taken the guns, here's the big news, everywhere they
[10:27.320 --> 10:32.120]  follow this, let's be reasonable, and then they ban everything, and then you have authoritarianism.
[10:32.120 --> 10:35.400]  They want the guns, there's only a few countries that have the guns.
[10:35.400 --> 10:39.040]  Well, and if you look at the guns that, the countries that have the strictest gun laws
[10:39.040 --> 10:43.240]  like Mexico, Brazil, there's obviously high level of crime, especially violent crime,
[10:43.240 --> 10:47.320]  with guns, but they don't wanna, they don't wanna talk about that.
[10:47.320 --> 10:51.000]  They, I think that they really, Alex, they have to throw the whole kitchen sink against
[10:51.000 --> 10:52.520]  the wall right now.
[10:52.520 --> 10:55.760]  And we were upset, you know, because we're sick of the Republicans, I mean, the Democrats
[10:55.760 --> 10:57.200]  and the Republicans, it's the same thing.
[10:57.200 --> 10:59.160]  I mean, that got proven again with this budget.
[10:59.160 --> 11:00.640]  It got proven again when the Republicans let-
[11:00.640 --> 11:02.520]  And they go, oh, a budget's not an omnibus.
[11:02.520 --> 11:06.600]  Yes, it's one of the 12 spending bills of the year that combines two of the monthly
[11:06.600 --> 11:08.240]  spending bills together.
[11:08.240 --> 11:09.920]  It's part of the funding of the country.
[11:09.920 --> 11:11.760]  People wanna play semantical games.
[11:11.760 --> 11:14.120]  The point is, is we're not happy Trump did this.
[11:14.120 --> 11:15.120]  He isn't a dictator.
[11:15.120 --> 11:16.640]  He doesn't control Congress.
[11:16.640 --> 11:21.880]  The issue is the Democrats frothing, funded by foreign money, hell-bent, destroy this
[11:21.880 --> 11:25.040]  American Revolution to make this country great again.
[11:25.040 --> 11:30.160]  If David Hogg is truly an intellectual, if David Hogg is truly somebody that can read
[11:30.160 --> 11:35.120]  and discern things, by the time he's 25 years old, he'll completely change all of his stances.
[11:35.120 --> 11:36.120]  That's the, that is what the-
[11:36.120 --> 11:41.800]  But it won't matter now, if you look at his extreme power trip and how he calls me a piece
[11:41.800 --> 11:46.560]  of SH, you know what, he calls me all these things, and then I just respond nicely.
[11:46.560 --> 11:48.440]  He challenges me to a debate.
[11:48.440 --> 11:49.440]  He backs out.
[11:49.440 --> 11:50.440]  He's scared.
[11:50.440 --> 11:55.040]  The media then says, Jones harasses him, asking for a debate when it's Hogg's own tweets
[11:55.040 --> 11:56.040]  and his own statements.
[11:56.040 --> 12:02.680]  So, this is a protected person from the beginning, who is allowed, because he's anti-America,
[12:02.680 --> 12:07.640]  anti-gun, to go out and say whatever he wants, and as a public figure now, YouTube, Facebook
[12:07.640 --> 12:13.160]  and Twitter ban you if you criticize someone speaking in front of 300,000 people shipped
[12:13.160 --> 12:19.480]  in by George Soros, with all the Hollywood losers brought in that nobody listens to,
[12:19.480 --> 12:20.480]  nobody cares.
[12:20.480 --> 12:25.120]  No older person, no middle-aged person, no even millennial, I know, lacks Hollywood.
[12:25.120 --> 12:26.120]  It's the most uncool thing.
[12:26.120 --> 12:31.360]  So, they just bring in a bunch of people on buses, paid to be there as a prop for a bunch
[12:31.360 --> 12:36.560]  of old Hollywood people and people like George Soros and Hillary Clinton to try to look cool
[12:36.560 --> 12:37.560]  and look young.
[12:37.560 --> 12:42.040]  And then coming up, we've got all the footage shot by Jack Mesobot of hundreds of buses
[12:42.040 --> 12:43.840]  coming in, but that's all admitted.
[12:43.840 --> 12:47.800]  The Democrats are funding this, but just a month ago, the Democrats admitted they were
[12:47.800 --> 12:51.320]  funding it, but if I covered it, they would ban us and kick us off YouTube.
[12:51.320 --> 12:53.560]  Again, they don't want you to know this is synthetic.
[12:53.560 --> 12:57.000]  Well, and then we're going to have highlights from the march in Austin as well and the craziness
[12:57.000 --> 12:58.000]  that was down there.
[12:58.000 --> 13:02.720]  But you know what, here's what David Hogg has actually done, and this is kind of a signal
[13:02.720 --> 13:05.280]  out to our audience that is millions and millions of people.
[13:05.280 --> 13:08.320]  God, look at those hundreds of buses.
[13:08.320 --> 13:09.320]  All you have to do to...
[13:09.320 --> 13:10.320]  Think of the money.
[13:10.320 --> 13:11.320]  Where does it come from?
[13:11.320 --> 13:12.320]  They pay for five of those.
[13:12.320 --> 13:13.320]  It's ridiculous.
[13:13.320 --> 13:16.880]  Soros spent $287 million on the women's march.
[13:16.880 --> 13:20.120]  The day after the inauguration, they wouldn't let us get in to see Trump.
[13:20.120 --> 13:21.720]  We didn't block them.
[13:21.720 --> 13:24.920]  $280 plus million on one march in DC.
[13:24.920 --> 13:29.240]  And then I have them on tape admitting that the organizers of these marches tell the protestors
[13:29.240 --> 13:30.360]  not to talk to inforters.
[13:30.360 --> 13:31.360]  We have it on tape.
[13:31.360 --> 13:32.840]  We'll play the tape later.
[13:32.840 --> 13:36.480]  But all you need right now, because none of them have any ideas.
[13:36.480 --> 13:38.480]  They just go, I'm paying $100 to be here.
[13:38.480 --> 13:39.760]  There's a void right now, Alex.
[13:39.760 --> 13:41.600]  And David Hogg can easily be defeated.
[13:41.600 --> 13:47.040]  All we need is to find a high school student that's a conservative, that's actually good-looking,
[13:47.040 --> 13:48.040]  and be like...
[13:48.040 --> 13:54.080]  I was in a car with six girls today, couple of my daughters, others nine, who were all
[13:54.080 --> 13:56.640]  way more well-spoken than Hogg.
[13:56.640 --> 14:00.080]  They were saying everything about guns don't kill...
[14:00.080 --> 14:02.040]  People don't kill people, blah, blah, blah.
[14:02.040 --> 14:03.040]  It was all this...
[14:03.040 --> 14:07.840]  I mean, they were laying it all out about statistically guns hardly kill anybody, and
[14:07.840 --> 14:12.640]  how it's criminal, insane people that kill people, not guns, and all the facts laying
[14:12.640 --> 14:16.680]  it all out, how their school force feeds them this, but then their parents won't let them
[14:16.680 --> 14:17.680]  go on air.
[14:17.680 --> 14:18.680]  But it's simple.
[14:18.680 --> 14:19.800]  A conservative that's...
[14:19.800 --> 14:21.880]  You want to defeat a chicken neck Nelly?
[14:21.880 --> 14:23.760]  You just present somebody that's an alpha male.
[14:23.760 --> 14:24.760]  That's all you do?
[14:24.760 --> 14:26.280]  What do you think the youth is going to do?
[14:26.280 --> 14:31.520]  Pick some chicken neck, no-chin, screwball, or pick some guy who's the captain of the
[14:31.520 --> 14:34.560]  football team, muscly, hangs out with the kid.
[14:34.560 --> 14:35.560]  And the problem is...
[14:35.560 --> 14:36.560]  Popular at school.
[14:36.560 --> 14:39.960]  The problem is no one who's a libertarian or a conservative or a pro-free market that
[14:39.960 --> 14:42.160]  made this country so great speaks out.
[14:42.160 --> 14:45.400]  They just sit there and watch Hollywood and all this garbage.
[14:45.400 --> 14:46.600]  That's the void that could be filled.
[14:46.600 --> 14:51.480]  I'm telling you, if one quarterback, one captain of the football squad that was beloved by the
[14:51.480 --> 14:55.720]  whole school, beloved by the whole community, hard worker, straight A's, all this stuff
[14:55.720 --> 14:58.960]  came forward, started a YouTube channel, well, listen viral, it'd be game over.
[14:58.960 --> 15:03.160]  They kicked the kids out of class or out of school that try to have a pro-life of pro-gun
[15:03.160 --> 15:04.160]  march.
[15:04.160 --> 15:05.160]  This is authoritarianism.
[15:05.160 --> 15:06.160]  This is peer pressure.
[15:06.160 --> 15:07.160]  This is criminal.
[15:07.160 --> 15:08.720]  Yeah, and now we have the tapes of that.
[15:08.720 --> 15:12.280]  And you've also got teachers getting put on leave, suspended if they don't want to go
[15:12.280 --> 15:13.680]  along with the brainwash.
[15:13.680 --> 15:16.920]  But doesn't it just show you everything that you've said, Alex?
[15:16.920 --> 15:20.400]  Higher education, public schools are not education anymore.
[15:20.400 --> 15:26.240]  What happens is you pay to send your children to get a worthless education and be indoctrinated
[15:26.240 --> 15:31.400]  by the losers that the system picked and got because they'll follow orders and pump a script
[15:31.400 --> 15:34.320]  into your children's brains that destroys their minds.
[15:34.320 --> 15:38.360]  And that's what this is because, again, less than 50 kids a year die in mass shootings,
[15:38.360 --> 15:42.520]  that much die every month in pool accidents, nobody's saying, keep us safe, not one more
[15:42.520 --> 15:44.600]  death in pools, ban pools.
[15:44.600 --> 15:47.880]  But that's this nanny, well, it is true, a lot of the hotels now have two foot deep
[15:47.880 --> 15:49.800]  pools, so nobody drowns.
[15:49.800 --> 15:54.080]  This nanny state is about domestication and total control, but America's awake, it's
[15:54.080 --> 15:55.080]  not going to work.
[15:55.080 --> 15:59.200]  A bunch of clips coming up.
[15:59.200 --> 16:03.360]  After years of research working with top developers here in the United States, with

[19:55.360 --> 20:24.080]  So win, win at infowarslife.com.
[20:24.080 --> 20:41.280]  That's right, no insurer here riding shotgun with me.
[20:41.280 --> 20:44.560]  So we're seeing synthetic politics.
[20:44.560 --> 20:49.320]  We're seeing foreign multinational money, George Soros money, it's on record.
[20:49.320 --> 20:53.920]  The women's march is what's funding the school walkouts, what's funding all this.
[20:53.920 --> 20:58.000]  They went beta tested, they had a stand down in Florida, the sheriff's department stood
[20:58.000 --> 21:02.080]  down, a mentally ill person wasn't supposed to have guns, was allowed to have guns, just
[21:02.080 --> 21:04.680]  like the Texas shooting last year.
[21:04.680 --> 21:09.160]  It rolls forward that all gun owners are to blame, that out of 3,000 students, many of
[21:09.160 --> 21:14.120]  them pro-gun, they picked David Hogg and a few others who were in the acting department,
[21:14.120 --> 21:19.560]  his parents are Democrats, FBI, anti-gun, not saying it didn't happen, not saying they're
[21:19.560 --> 21:24.920]  fake, we're saying it's scripted and funded by the Democrats, this whole demonization
[21:24.920 --> 21:25.920]  of the Second Amendment.
[21:25.920 --> 21:35.680]  And then he comes out and he says, the power structure is shaking right now, and he even
[21:35.680 --> 21:42.000]  wears an armband now in these weird photo montages, we've got on infowars.com, it is
[21:42.000 --> 21:48.680]  completely fascistic, again, Hollywood, desperate to maintain control of America, now pushing
[21:48.680 --> 21:54.320]  these whole narratives that gun owners are to blame, and that we have to all be dealt
[21:54.320 --> 21:59.960]  with, and he says, we call BS, he wears this arrogant pin, well I call BS with 50 people
[21:59.960 --> 22:04.560]  down here in mass shootings, thousands and thousands in backyard pools, one of the rarest
[22:04.560 --> 22:08.760]  forms of death is a mass shooting, I call BS on Mexico banning all the guns, having
[22:08.760 --> 22:12.120]  one of the highest crime rates in the world, or Brazil, the highest crime rate in the world,
[22:12.120 --> 22:13.840]  now trying to pass the Second Amendment.
[22:13.840 --> 22:22.640]  I call BS on Shroyer, but here is the cringe-worthy, David Hogg, the man out of 2,000 plus other
[22:22.640 --> 22:25.760]  students, you don't hear from them, they have articles on infowars where they've been banned
[22:25.760 --> 22:30.080]  from the news, but you hear from him and you're not supposed to criticize him, you're supposed
[22:30.080 --> 22:34.760]  to have him point his finger and others at Daniel Loche and others and say, you're a
[22:34.760 --> 22:39.240]  murderer, you're a criminal, you need to be shut down, and free species need to be shut
[22:39.240 --> 22:45.160]  down, and then in D.C., you need to turn in your guns because it's your fault what somebody
[22:45.160 --> 22:46.160]  else did.
[22:46.160 --> 22:51.640]  Now there's the article, liberal media centers pro second amendment teen, that's up on infowars.com
[22:51.640 --> 22:55.760]  right now from newsbusters, but let's go to this cringe-worthy David Hogg.
[22:55.760 --> 23:01.520]  You can hear the people in power shaking, they've gotten used to being protective of their
[23:01.520 --> 23:11.520]  position, the safety of inaction, inaction is no longer safe, and to that we say no more.
[23:11.520 --> 23:21.640]  You see those giant hordes of welfare queens and EBT card controllers and socialist professors
[23:21.640 --> 23:26.080]  and everybody else, and you look at them, they all look victimized, they all look mentally
[23:26.080 --> 23:29.960]  ill, there's something wrong with them, they all look really scared, they're freaked out,
[23:29.960 --> 23:33.800]  they help some big government techs care of them, every time they get control, Venezuela,
[23:33.800 --> 23:42.120]  Cuba, North Korea, communist China, they're the fools that open the door to all of this,
[23:42.120 --> 23:48.880]  and once they get our guns in every case, they then organize like lemmings, oceans of
[23:48.880 --> 23:55.240]  these people to take over the farms, the factories, the businesses, because they see us the productive,
[23:55.240 --> 24:02.120]  the hardworking as the food, and the big mega-rich up above it, the Bezosas, the George Sorosas,
[24:02.120 --> 24:06.560]  the Apple owners that are all tax exempt and have hundreds of billions of dollars apiece,
[24:06.560 --> 24:12.680]  they always ought to organize the giant unwashed mass, pressure from above and below, to annihilate
[24:12.680 --> 24:13.680]  the middle class.
[24:13.680 --> 24:17.720]  There's not many middle classes left, they got rid of them in Argentina and Venezuela,
[24:17.720 --> 24:23.920]  they got rid of them in Russia, and now they are coming with the big corporate dying media
[24:23.920 --> 24:30.520]  trying to organize children after sabotaging their minds and using the death of 15 students
[24:30.520 --> 24:34.640]  to project it onto everybody else and say, they're your enemy, go out and get them, get
[24:34.640 --> 24:39.080]  their guns, but the National Guard with guns was protecting that event, Owen.
[24:39.080 --> 24:43.080]  Well, let's be very clear, just to expand on what you're saying and to give it a little
[24:43.080 --> 24:48.320]  background, if you don't think for one second that the Democrat Party, which is the Republican
[24:48.320 --> 24:53.040]  Party, but specifically the Democrat Party wouldn't gladly let people die for their
[24:53.040 --> 24:56.880]  political agenda, I'm sorry, but you're gonna have to do a little research and find out
[24:56.880 --> 24:57.880]  you're wrong.
[24:57.880 --> 25:01.440]  They funded the Arab Spring, they killed millions of people.
[25:01.440 --> 25:04.800]  Party the KKK, funded the Arab Spring, Hillary brags about what happened in Libya, now there's
[25:04.800 --> 25:05.880]  people enslaved.
[25:05.880 --> 25:10.880]  How about the Project Veritas video that exposes Aaron Black funded by the DNC to go to Chicago
[25:10.880 --> 25:14.080]  and start a riot where people could have died?
[25:14.080 --> 25:18.920]  How about Heather Hayer that dies at the march that the Democrats planned in Charlottesville?
[25:18.920 --> 25:24.080]  So if you don't think for one second the Democrats would gladly let people die to get their political
[25:24.080 --> 25:25.080]  agenda out.
[25:25.080 --> 25:32.600]  Oh, the police stood down and then were ordered to corral all of the alt-right people into
[25:32.600 --> 25:34.640]  that to have an explosion.
[25:34.640 --> 25:36.240]  And why were they out there to begin with?
[25:36.240 --> 25:37.680]  Who put them out there marching?
[25:37.680 --> 25:39.280]  Who told them they had to march?
[25:39.280 --> 25:41.880]  The Democrats, the Soros funded groups.
[25:41.880 --> 25:46.560]  And now those very funded groups are suing us for exposing what happened in Charlottesville
[25:46.560 --> 25:50.840]  and then lying about what we said, we said the people there, the Democrats killed the
[25:50.840 --> 25:51.840]  woman.
[25:51.840 --> 25:56.800]  No, we said they funded the chaos, the Democratic Party Soros funded Antifa, we even have the
[25:56.800 --> 25:59.280]  documents, so we'll see how that goes in court.
[25:59.280 --> 26:03.320]  But here's the thing, let's go back to Hogg, like back then, I'm going to play it one more
[26:03.320 --> 26:04.320]  time from the beginning.
[26:04.320 --> 26:10.200]  Here's Hogg reading off his piece of paper and he's telling you the power structure
[26:10.200 --> 26:15.560]  shaking in its boots, yeah, from the American people, from us and the Second Amendment,
[26:15.560 --> 26:20.880]  not from them, that's what needs to be understood, here it is.
[26:20.880 --> 26:26.480]  You can hear the people in power shaking, they've gotten used to being protective of
[26:26.480 --> 26:33.000]  their positions, the safety of inaction, this is a Nazi march right here, that's what they
[26:33.000 --> 26:37.720]  want, guns, you think he's on a public figure, you can't talk about him though.
[26:37.720 --> 26:45.120]  More, 96 people reading off a strip, 96 people die every day from guns in our country.
[26:45.120 --> 26:49.880]  Hold on, I'm going to play this from the start, I want to back it up to the beginning
[26:49.880 --> 26:50.880]  please.
[26:50.880 --> 26:55.640]  Back up to the beginning, I want you to hear about all that again, yes, that's right, more
[26:55.640 --> 26:59.800]  than half of the gun deaths in this country are suicide, you die of bone cancer, brain
[26:59.800 --> 27:03.120]  cancer, can't pay for it, whatever, you get out of your misery, they're all for sister
[27:03.120 --> 27:04.120]  suicide, right?
[27:04.120 --> 27:11.000]  Then almost all the rest of it is gang related, less than 50 kids a year, it's like 46 a year,
[27:11.000 --> 27:15.480]  46 a year, look at the federal numbers, dying mass shootings, that's too many, but they
[27:15.480 --> 27:20.840]  create this whole illusion, let's go back to hog, here it is.
[27:20.840 --> 27:26.440]  You can hear the people in power shaking, they've gotten used to being protective of
[27:26.440 --> 27:33.640]  their positions, showing safety, the safety of inaction, inaction is no longer safe, and
[27:33.640 --> 27:36.040]  to that we say, no more.
[27:36.040 --> 27:42.400]  You talk about zombies, look at that crowd, they like it waddles, 96 people die every
[27:42.400 --> 27:50.840]  day from guns in our country, yet most representatives have no public stance on guns, and to that
[27:50.840 --> 27:52.600]  we say, no more.
[27:52.600 --> 27:59.280]  Pause, we are going, perfect psychology though, every time there's a shooting, which is going
[27:59.280 --> 28:04.840]  to happen, like there's a stabbing, a baseball batting, a running over, a poisoning, a strangling,
[28:04.840 --> 28:10.040]  it's part of human nature, they go, no more, every time someone gets shot, it's gun owners
[28:10.040 --> 28:16.360]  fault, every time someone uses a gun wrong, it's your fault, it's your fault Owen, and
[28:16.360 --> 28:20.880]  then they have this moral high ground, where they sit there and act like, because we're
[28:20.880 --> 28:25.280]  a free country, and some bad people use guns wrongly, that it's all of our faults, and
[28:25.280 --> 28:29.440]  then each time it happens they go, see, never again can something bad happen, it's your
[28:29.440 --> 28:31.680]  fault, it is just incredible.
[28:31.680 --> 28:35.000]  And of course there's no logic, there's no reasoning, they don't look at the actual history,
[28:35.000 --> 28:38.320]  they don't look at the actual statistics, it's all about virtue signaling, based on
[28:38.320 --> 28:40.320]  democrat, nazi style propaganda.
[28:40.320 --> 28:44.520]  We're going to break it in 19 seconds, the point is, who's funding this, George Soros
[28:44.520 --> 28:50.680]  on record, who's funding this, the globalist, who's funding this multinational foreign powers
[28:50.680 --> 28:59.200]  that want total control, we'll be right back, I'm Alex Jones, infowars.com, newswars.com.
[28:59.200 --> 29:06.120]  It's been sold out for months, and now it's back, it's mycozx plus lower price, more ingredients,
[29:06.120 --> 29:11.440]  because we scaled up, signed a year contract with even bigger organic manufacturer and
[29:11.440 --> 29:18.480]  producer, scalability, but now we're able to go at 50% off to $27 instead of $39, 50%
[29:18.480 --> 29:22.760]  off, because there's a lot of product and a lot of ingredient, mycozx, now it's the
[29:22.760 --> 29:26.480]  other side of the equation, everybody thinks about probiotics, now great they are, for
[29:26.480 --> 29:30.360]  your gut, because of toxins in the environment, pesticides, herbicides, but more importantly
[29:30.360 --> 29:36.960]  than bad bacteria, the probiotics help this place, yeast mold creates slime walls, and
[29:36.960 --> 29:41.880]  once the candida and the yeast and the mold and all that get in there, it causes all sorts
[29:41.880 --> 29:46.320]  of serious issues, well this has got a bunch of concentrated herbs in it, and compounds
[29:46.320 --> 29:50.960]  known to destroy that slime wall, don't wait to start detoxifying your body until it's
[29:50.960 --> 29:59.840]  too late, pick up a bottle of the new and improved mycozx plus, now from the info wars store,
[29:59.840 --> 30:06.200]  I want to plow into all of this, but I'm going to spend a few minutes here first, just encouraging
[30:06.200 --> 30:11.680]  listeners to understand that when you buy t-shirts, or water filtration systems, or

[30:56.480 --> 30:58.200]  we need your support.
[30:58.200 --> 31:04.800]  The reason infowarslife has five star ratings on major third party sites is because I want
[31:04.800 --> 31:08.480]  products I'm going to use for my family, I take this, my family takes this, and then
[31:08.480 --> 31:12.240]  it funds the operation, but the most hardcore, truthful information you're going to find
[31:12.240 --> 31:16.080]  anywhere, so what you find in our news, is the same thing you find in our products at
[31:16.080 --> 31:17.080]  infowarslife.com.
[31:17.080 --> 31:23.520]  If I ever forget to take them, I have a noticeable difference, I don't feel good, the nascent
[31:23.520 --> 31:26.600]  iodine is one of the ones that was life changing for me.
[31:26.600 --> 31:31.840]  Yeah, I've actually just run out of my superfemale, I had a few bottles at my house, and I've
[31:31.840 --> 31:37.200]  been taking it again, hitting the gym once again, very exciting, feeling great, looking
[31:37.200 --> 31:43.880]  good, and I know my hair is luxurious once again, so obviously the superfemale is amazing,
[31:43.880 --> 31:44.880]  I love it.
[31:44.880 --> 31:49.520]  The nascent iodine is essential, Survival Shield X2, if there's one product that I would
[31:49.520 --> 31:53.800]  say is life changing that I would suggest, it's nascent iodine, Survival Shield X2,
[31:53.800 --> 31:59.840]  it's got a five star rating, it's a win-win, infowarslife.com.

[32:03.880 --> 32:09.000]  enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[32:09.000 --> 32:13.040]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern
[32:13.040 --> 32:17.400]  Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade grown Arabica beans.
[32:17.400 --> 32:22.720]  We have now managed to secure the sought after beans in a highly customized blend.
[32:22.720 --> 32:29.120]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% organic coffee at infowarslife.com.

[32:33.600 --> 32:36.040]  heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[32:36.040 --> 32:40.640]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections
[32:40.640 --> 32:43.320]  directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[32:43.320 --> 32:48.080]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[32:48.080 --> 32:51.160]  Available in original or with our immune support infusion blend.

[32:55.960 --> 32:57.840]  of my favorite coffee.
[32:57.840 --> 33:26.840]  Live from the infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[33:50.040 --> 33:56.160]  By the way folks, I'll be back tomorrow, 11am for four hours with the Alex Jones show.
[33:56.160 --> 34:01.680]  Owen will be there with the war room, that's of course three to six, and David Knight in
[34:01.680 --> 34:02.680]  the mornings.
[34:02.680 --> 34:06.360]  We were doing 10 hours a day live now, but going back to Owen here.
[34:06.360 --> 34:13.040]  Owen, I want to get to some more of these clips, we're not hysterical, we're just upset
[34:13.040 --> 34:18.120]  because we knew the big assault was coming on the Second Amendment, and this is the biggest
[34:18.120 --> 34:19.120]  we've ever seen.
[34:19.120 --> 34:23.680]  Here's some of the headlines I put out earlier on live, internet feeds of the show.
[34:23.680 --> 34:27.560]  First offensive in history, launched against the First and Second Amendment, live coverage
[34:27.560 --> 34:29.400]  of Soros anti-gun march.
[34:29.400 --> 34:34.960]  This is a Nazi collaborator, foreign globalist funding this on record, and the media tries
[34:34.960 --> 34:41.360]  to ban you, and CNN argues to have infowars banned off YouTube for saying hog is a democratic
[34:41.360 --> 34:44.960]  party mouthpiece when he is.
[34:44.960 --> 34:49.680]  On Twitter, Democrats openly chant, we have the power, we will ban the guns, at rallies
[34:49.680 --> 34:50.680]  nationwide.
[34:50.680 --> 34:54.280]  You've got that footage in Austin, you've got highlights coming up next hour.
[34:54.280 --> 34:59.280]  YouTube, tonight, Stormy, 60 minutes set for Trump's sex, Democrats announced revolution
[34:59.280 --> 35:00.760]  against the Second Amendment.
[35:00.760 --> 35:02.240]  This is it, folks.
[35:02.240 --> 35:07.800]  They mean real authoritarianism in this country, they're pushing on every front, and people
[35:07.800 --> 35:12.440]  can bitch and grab about free market and the rest of it all day long, but that's what made
[35:12.440 --> 35:15.520]  America great compared to these other nations.
[35:15.520 --> 35:18.600]  But since we mentioned it, let's go to this next clip.
[35:18.600 --> 35:20.760]  This is MSNBC's Matthews.
[35:20.760 --> 35:25.000]  People should expect basic restrictions on gun rights, like you can't buy guns till
[35:25.000 --> 35:29.040]  you're 18, like felons can't get them, like there's background checks, like this guy had
[35:29.040 --> 35:32.640]  been arrested and adjudicated as mentally ill and shouldn't have owned guns, just like
[35:32.640 --> 35:37.440]  the Texas shooter was in a mental institution, disarmed, will be discharged with the FBI,
[35:37.440 --> 35:39.880]  and the military didn't file it.
[35:39.880 --> 35:43.640]  They're always protected, the police always stand down magically, and there's all these
[35:43.640 --> 35:47.840]  other school shootings where the guy pulls a gun and the cop shoots him in five seconds,
[35:47.840 --> 35:50.400]  but then no media coverage.
[35:50.400 --> 35:56.320]  Every week some loon, always on Prozac goes in, and the cop shoots him in seconds, but
[35:56.320 --> 35:57.320]  then no coverage.
[35:57.320 --> 35:58.320]  Exactly.
[35:58.320 --> 35:59.320]  Go ahead.
[35:59.320 --> 36:02.480]  Well, that's because it doesn't fit their agenda, and so then you have all of these marchers
[36:02.480 --> 36:06.320]  go out on the streets and they think they're marching because, oh, the only school shooting
[36:06.320 --> 36:09.960]  that ever happened was the Florida shooting where 17 people died, and it was because this
[36:09.960 --> 36:14.600]  one nut was able to get an AR because of the NRA and the Second Amendment.
[36:14.600 --> 36:19.000]  And it's like, well, no, that's one example, you didn't even cover the story in Maryland
[36:19.000 --> 36:22.200]  where the school shooter didn't even get to kill anyone, the mass shooting was stopped
[36:22.200 --> 36:24.200]  by the officer on the scene with the gun.
[36:24.200 --> 36:27.600]  Because he didn't stand down, and the notice hogging them go, it's fine, the sheriff and
[36:27.600 --> 36:28.600]  the deputy stood down.
[36:28.600 --> 36:29.600]  They're good.
[36:29.600 --> 36:30.600]  You're scary.
[36:30.600 --> 36:31.600]  You don't.
[36:31.600 --> 36:34.840]  Again, you advertise schools as victim assignment zones.
[36:34.840 --> 36:36.840]  You advertise, this is where you go.
[36:36.840 --> 36:40.600]  It's always some person on psychotropic and government care that gets protected.
[36:40.600 --> 36:42.600]  They go in, the police stand down.
[36:42.600 --> 36:43.600]  It's always the same story.
[36:43.600 --> 36:45.200]  Well, and they really think it's our fault.
[36:45.200 --> 36:48.480]  I mean, that's the brainwashing, like Eric Holder said, we have to brainwash people into
[36:48.480 --> 36:49.480]  thinking differently.
[36:49.480 --> 36:51.600]  So the Democrats admit that this is their brainwashing propaganda.
[36:51.600 --> 36:53.240]  I mean, you're falling for propaganda.
[36:53.240 --> 36:54.240]  Look at what Eric Holder says.
[36:54.240 --> 36:55.240]  That's right.
[36:55.240 --> 36:59.080]  The former attorney general says, we are brainwashing you.
[36:59.080 --> 37:00.080]  No kidding.
[37:00.080 --> 37:02.960]  Every show I see on Netflix is globalist propaganda.
[37:02.960 --> 37:04.600]  I can't even watch it anymore.
[37:04.600 --> 37:09.000]  Yeah, it does suck that the liberals have tried to take over every element of our culture.
[37:09.000 --> 37:10.000]  Because they're not liberals.
[37:10.000 --> 37:12.160]  They are mentally ill-controlled freaks.
[37:12.160 --> 37:15.400]  And then they're cowardly beta followers.
[37:15.400 --> 37:19.760]  Well, and then they ask me, Alex, they're like, oh, because we're the bad guys, you
[37:19.760 --> 37:21.080]  know, I've got an NRA hat on.
[37:21.080 --> 37:24.440]  So I'm the worst man on earth and say, oh, how do you sleep at night?
[37:24.440 --> 37:25.440]  How do you sleep?
[37:25.440 --> 37:26.600]  Well, actually, you know what?
[37:26.600 --> 37:30.000]  I actually don't get much sleep because I'm trying to fight the globalist propaganda trying
[37:30.000 --> 37:31.600]  to bring this country down.
[37:31.600 --> 37:36.040]  Every African country has gunbands on the citizens and they all have higher crime rates
[37:36.040 --> 37:37.040]  than us.
[37:37.040 --> 37:39.600]  Mexico, Brazil, the highest in the world, total gunbands.
[37:39.600 --> 37:41.120]  We have the facts.
[37:41.120 --> 37:42.120]  They don't care.
[37:42.120 --> 37:43.800]  That's why they're trying to get our youth.
[37:43.800 --> 37:44.880]  We put them in the public schools.
[37:44.880 --> 37:46.000]  We put them in the colleges.
[37:46.000 --> 37:47.200]  We pay for it all.
[37:47.200 --> 37:52.080]  And then all the losers that basically matriculate into that, they sit there and believe if they
[37:52.080 --> 37:53.080]  can get it.
[37:53.080 --> 37:54.560]  Look, look, look, the average leftist knows.
[37:54.560 --> 37:57.000]  That's why the Antifa says they're going to use guns.
[37:57.000 --> 37:58.480]  The left says they're going to kill us.
[37:58.480 --> 37:59.880]  Hashtag our Republicans.
[37:59.880 --> 38:02.720]  They just want a revolution to steal all our wealth.
[38:02.720 --> 38:05.360]  But they can't steal that we're hardworking and smart.
[38:05.360 --> 38:07.280]  You'll always be sacks of crap.
[38:07.280 --> 38:09.000]  You'll always be losers.
[38:09.000 --> 38:10.000]  Don't you get it?
[38:10.000 --> 38:11.000]  You pieces of filth.
[38:11.000 --> 38:15.760]  Go to Cuba, go to Venezuela, go to North Korea, stop trying to suck off those of us
[38:15.760 --> 38:16.760]  that are smart.
[38:16.760 --> 38:18.360]  We're sorry you're trash.
[38:18.360 --> 38:19.800]  We're sorry you're dumb.
[38:19.800 --> 38:21.440]  We're sorry you're stupid.
[38:21.440 --> 38:26.520]  But dominating us in giant hordes of zombies will never make you a man.
[38:26.520 --> 38:28.800]  It'll never make you a real boy.
[38:28.800 --> 38:32.560]  And that's where the social media aspect comes in, where you have these people that don't
[38:32.560 --> 38:33.560]  feel accomplished.
[38:33.560 --> 38:35.960]  They don't feel like they have anything that they can stand on.
[38:35.960 --> 38:39.280]  They, you know, whatever it is going on in their personal lives, they don't have anything
[38:39.280 --> 38:44.880]  that they just want to conquer the family and swimming pools and factories and fields
[38:44.880 --> 38:48.560]  and farmers and jobs and red-blooded behavior.
[38:48.560 --> 38:53.040]  But the left, you want, the left walks around, they're all mentally ill twisted people and
[38:53.040 --> 38:55.080]  they just freak out on anything good.
[38:55.080 --> 38:57.480]  You watch them, they're like gibbering crazy people.
[38:57.480 --> 39:01.040]  That's, they think that they're cool because they go to a march and then they have the
[39:01.040 --> 39:02.720]  hashtag on social media, right?
[39:02.720 --> 39:04.240]  They don't have accomplishments.
[39:04.240 --> 39:06.480]  They don't have anything that they've actually done.
[39:06.480 --> 39:11.200]  And they block all our hashtags on Facebook, Google, all of it, Twitter.
[39:11.200 --> 39:15.760]  It's only for them, but it's all fake dopamine in the words of Sean Parker and others.
[39:15.760 --> 39:16.760]  It's all fake.
[39:16.760 --> 39:17.760]  None of it's real.
[39:17.760 --> 39:18.760]  So it's, oh, look at me.
[39:18.760 --> 39:21.600]  I was at the march for our lives, hashtag march for our lives, hashtag get a bunch of
[39:21.600 --> 39:26.000]  retweets, hashtag some, you know, certified liberal gets to retweet them.
[39:26.000 --> 39:27.160]  And then the, oh my God.
[39:27.160 --> 39:28.160]  And then that's their thing.
[39:28.160 --> 39:29.160]  Like that's their accomplishment.
[39:29.160 --> 39:32.560]  Alex like, oh my gosh, I was at the march, I made a tweet.
[39:32.560 --> 39:34.160]  Let's play the next clip.
[39:34.160 --> 39:35.600]  This is their main assault.
[39:35.600 --> 39:40.280]  Here is Chris Matthews with no ratings, no viewers, total failure telling you there's
[39:40.280 --> 39:41.840]  going to be some basic control.
[39:41.840 --> 39:44.720]  They're already massive control.
[39:44.720 --> 39:47.280]  And that's what they're pissed about is they can't get our first.
[39:47.280 --> 39:51.200]  They can't get our second, but now they're trying to ban pro second amendment speech.
[39:51.200 --> 39:55.160]  Chris Matthews, people should expect basic restrictions on gun rights on info wars.com
[39:55.160 --> 39:56.160]  right now.
[39:56.160 --> 39:57.160]  Here's the video.
[39:57.160 --> 40:03.760]  When in your lifetime, in our lifetime, did the second amendment start getting quoted
[40:03.760 --> 40:08.000]  start taking on a kind of different meaning than when we were kids?
[40:08.000 --> 40:16.560]  It began with the fear that guns would be registered like cars are coming for your gun.
[40:16.560 --> 40:17.840]  And then they'll come and get them.
[40:17.840 --> 40:19.680]  Once they have the list, they'll come and get it.
[40:19.680 --> 40:24.520]  It's always been a, it's a pretty, on a one hand, it's a fairly legitimate American concern
[40:24.520 --> 40:26.440]  about the rise of too much government.
[40:26.440 --> 40:31.840]  I mean, it goes back to the British, the British colonization of this country and people don't
[40:31.840 --> 40:32.840]  like big government.
[40:32.840 --> 40:34.040]  They don't like people told what to do.
[40:34.040 --> 40:37.280]  They want to be able to get on their motorcycle without a helmet.
[40:37.280 --> 40:38.280]  They want to be able to smoke.
[40:38.280 --> 40:39.280]  Yeah.
[40:39.280 --> 40:42.360]  They like, they want to be able to have big, big soda.
[40:42.360 --> 40:47.920]  They don't want to be penalized for what somebody else does, especially when it's a
[40:47.920 --> 40:52.840]  super rare crime and the places that ban the guns like Chicago, New York, D.C. of the highest
[40:52.840 --> 40:53.840]  crime rates.
[40:53.840 --> 40:58.520]  But he's trying to sound reasonable now, but we've got Pelosi, Feinstein, Moore all saying
[40:58.520 --> 41:01.240]  we want a total abolition where you have no guns.
[41:01.240 --> 41:02.720]  They want hunting ban too.
[41:02.720 --> 41:03.720]  Here it is.
[41:03.720 --> 41:04.720]  Smoke.
[41:04.720 --> 41:05.720]  Yeah.
[41:05.720 --> 41:07.720]  They like, they want to be able to have big drinks of soda.
[41:07.720 --> 41:08.720]  Yeah.
[41:08.720 --> 41:09.720]  They like freedom.
[41:09.720 --> 41:11.440]  And the question is, when does freedom go on?
[41:11.440 --> 41:12.440]  Oh, pause again.
[41:12.440 --> 41:13.440]  Bloomberg wants the big sodas ban.
[41:13.440 --> 41:14.440]  Let's continue.
[41:14.440 --> 41:16.960]  Against someone else's basic safety.
[41:16.960 --> 41:20.800]  And that's what the government near here, a few blocks away, has to decide.
[41:20.800 --> 41:26.720]  Where does one person's right trespass on someone else's more basic right, it's life.
[41:26.720 --> 41:31.120]  And government is in our lives, you can't get in your car without getting yelled at to
[41:31.120 --> 41:32.840]  put your seatbelt on.
[41:32.840 --> 41:33.840]  That's enough.
[41:33.840 --> 41:34.840]  Yeah, exactly.
[41:34.840 --> 41:36.680]  They haven't found a baby they didn't want to kill.
[41:36.680 --> 41:40.960]  They're pushing worldwide Islamic takeover, open borders, globalism, you know, hundreds
[41:40.960 --> 41:42.520]  of thousands of graves in Mexico.
[41:42.520 --> 41:43.520]  They don't care about that.
[41:43.520 --> 41:44.840]  It's all just a few deaths.
[41:44.840 --> 41:49.320]  They zoom in on, they humanize, they project on Americans and say, you're bad Owen, you've
[41:49.320 --> 41:50.320]  got armed guards.
[41:50.320 --> 41:55.680]  But then Chris Matthews, Pelosi, all these people, just like Pierce Morgan got caught
[41:55.680 --> 41:56.880]  with armed guards in his house.
[41:56.880 --> 42:00.440]  So they've got armed guards, they've got guns, but you can't have them.
[42:00.440 --> 42:01.760]  I just can't even believe this.
[42:01.760 --> 42:08.160]  I can't believe that the very party that promotes abortion, funds abortion, loves abortion,
[42:08.160 --> 42:12.760]  marches for abortion is going to come out here and have a quote, march for our lives
[42:12.760 --> 42:17.920]  with little graphics of children using the children as political pawns.
[42:17.920 --> 42:19.960]  You don't give a damn about children.
[42:19.960 --> 42:23.520]  You gladly abort a million babies a year and then you're going to virtue signal to
[42:23.520 --> 42:27.120]  me about children lives and somehow I'm the bad guy.
[42:27.120 --> 42:30.680]  No, it's an elite that wants to neuter America.
[42:30.680 --> 42:31.680]  That's what it's all about.
[42:31.680 --> 42:37.080]  When you come back, Jack Pasobic shot video, it's got millions of years of hundreds of
[42:37.080 --> 42:38.080]  buses.
[42:38.080 --> 42:39.080]  It's like an hour long video.
[42:39.080 --> 42:40.440]  We're going to take a minute of it.
[42:40.440 --> 42:45.840]  Just the first shot you see like 30 buses down this road, it goes on, it just walks.
[42:45.840 --> 42:47.600]  It's bus after bus after bus.
[42:47.600 --> 42:52.520]  It just goes on for an hour, just buses and buses and buses and buses and buses.
[42:52.520 --> 42:56.120]  We're talking hundreds of millions of dollars to ship these people in.
[42:56.120 --> 42:59.800]  They admit as the Democrats, it's a Nazi collaborator named George Soros.
[42:59.800 --> 43:03.160]  Introducing Cell Force by Info Wars Life.
[43:03.160 --> 43:07.240]  Cell Force focuses on mitochondria efficiency and protection.
[43:07.240 --> 43:10.000]  Mitochondria produce over 95% of your energy.
[43:10.000 --> 43:12.640]  They are your body's cellular engines.
[43:12.640 --> 43:17.320]  Cell Force helps promote your cellular energy production by supporting mitochondria, much
[43:17.320 --> 43:19.800]  like a cellular engine overhaul.
[43:19.800 --> 43:24.280]  Because when your mitochondria don't run at 100% efficiency, then they start producing
[43:24.280 --> 43:26.720]  reactive oxygen species.
[43:26.720 --> 43:31.920]  Top scientists agree that aging is most likely caused by cellular damage, resulting from
[43:31.920 --> 43:34.800]  these reactive oxygen species.
[43:34.800 --> 43:39.840]  The antioxidants found in Cell Force are some of the most powerful available on the market.
[43:39.840 --> 43:44.680]  The stronger the antioxidant, the better its ability to scavenge for these reactive oxygen
[43:44.680 --> 43:47.520]  species and other free radicals.
[43:47.520 --> 43:52.480]  Boost, protect and adapt with Cell Force from Info Wars Life.

[44:45.080 --> 44:49.840]  Not only does vitamin D3 promote a healthy mood, but vitamin D supports our memory and
[44:49.840 --> 44:51.000]  brain function.
[44:51.000 --> 44:58.360]  For something the globalists are targeting, visit infowars.com today or call 888-253-3139.
[45:21.000 --> 45:22.000]  Let me tell you something.
[45:22.000 --> 45:27.360]  It is perfect for freeze drying fruits, vegetables, meats, dairy products, desserts, and entire
[45:27.360 --> 45:28.360]  meals.
[45:28.360 --> 45:29.360]  Woo!
[45:29.360 --> 45:30.360]  That's what I'm talking about.
[45:30.360 --> 45:34.840]  And when compared to traditional methods of preservation, like canning or dehydrating,
[45:34.840 --> 45:38.520]  you know like what you get at the grocery store, there is no comparison.
[45:38.520 --> 45:44.680]  Harvest right freeze dryers retain 97% of the food's taste, color, and nutritional value
[45:44.680 --> 45:48.160]  and have a shelf life of up to 25 years.
[45:48.160 --> 45:51.880]  Now that's what I call the miracle of food preservation.
[45:51.880 --> 45:55.760]  Harvest right is truly the world's best, most affordable freeze dryer.
[45:55.760 --> 45:56.760]  So what are you waiting for?
[45:56.760 --> 45:59.960]  Check it out right now at infowarsstore.com.
[45:59.960 --> 46:02.960]  They use their media to assassinate real news.
[46:02.960 --> 46:07.160]  They use their schools to teach children that their president is another Hitler.
[46:07.160 --> 46:11.800]  They use their movie stars and singers and comedy shows and award shows to repeat their
[46:11.800 --> 46:14.520]  narrative over and over again.
[46:14.520 --> 46:18.320]  And then they use their ex-president to endorse the resistance.
[46:18.320 --> 46:24.200]  All to make them march, make them protest, make them scream racism and sexism and xenophobia
[46:24.200 --> 46:30.040]  and homophobia, to smash windows, burn cars, shut down interstates and airports, bully
[46:30.040 --> 46:35.480]  and terrorize the law-abiding, until the only option left is for the police to do their
[46:35.480 --> 46:38.400]  jobs and stop the madness.
[46:38.400 --> 46:42.480]  And when that happens, they'll use it as an excuse for their outrage.
[46:42.480 --> 46:49.080]  The only way we stop this, the only way we save our country and our freedom is to fight
[46:49.080 --> 46:53.560]  this violence of lies with the clenched fist of truth.
[46:53.560 --> 47:23.520]  I'm the National Rifle Association of America and I'm Freedom's Safest Place.
[30:41.560 --> 47:52.520]  National Rifle Association of America and I'm Freedom's Safest Place.
[47:52.520 --> 48:01.800]  There's massive bullying taking place against gun owners, against our free speech, against
[48:01.800 --> 48:02.800]  the republic.
[48:02.800 --> 48:06.520]  This is a foreign outside power coming in and taking over the country.
[48:06.520 --> 48:11.160]  And when you realize that Soros and all these groups are foreign powers on record, and the
[48:11.160 --> 48:15.280]  Council on Foreign Relations put out a report that we linked to on Infowars.com admitting
[48:15.280 --> 48:17.640]  Trump is killing globalism.
[48:17.640 --> 48:21.680]  Trump is killing the New World Order and you understand why they hate him so much.
[48:21.680 --> 48:22.680]  That doesn't mean he's perfect.
[48:22.680 --> 48:23.680]  He doesn't control Congress.
[48:23.680 --> 48:27.680]  And then you have the head of the Hungarian Parliament warns of anti-human global government.
[48:27.680 --> 48:32.880]  Technocrats are stripping away religions, national, and sexual identities, he said,
[48:32.880 --> 48:34.760]  for total control.
[48:34.760 --> 48:37.200]  That's the game plan.
[48:37.200 --> 48:40.440]  Anyone that buys into other garbage is being programmed.
[48:40.440 --> 48:45.360]  There are mega banks that control the fiat currency that want disarmed populations.
[48:45.360 --> 48:49.960]  It doesn't mean there aren't some problems with guns or cars or knives or drugs.
[48:49.960 --> 48:50.960]  It's free will.
[48:50.960 --> 48:56.560]  When they say never again, never one more kid shot, well, your advertising schools is
[48:56.560 --> 49:01.040]  gun free zones where you go kill people and you wonder why another person on the record
[49:01.040 --> 49:06.040]  who should have their guns taken didn't have them taken.
[49:06.040 --> 49:13.040]  And then you look at, in one highway, hundreds of buses to bus in the Democratic Party's
[49:13.040 --> 49:18.400]  database with unlimited globalist money to tell us that we're at fault and we've got
[49:18.400 --> 49:20.000]  to turn our guns in, Owen.
[49:20.000 --> 49:21.680]  This is just crazy.
[49:21.680 --> 49:24.400]  And the same groups want our free speech gone.
[49:24.400 --> 49:27.520]  Newspapers everywhere every day say, Jones doesn't deserve to be on air.
[49:27.520 --> 49:29.520]  He should be banned from speech.
[49:29.520 --> 49:32.840]  I mean, anyone should look at that and go, that's insane.
[49:32.840 --> 49:35.680]  What is it this guy's saying that's so dangerous?
[49:35.680 --> 49:38.000]  Then the new thing is they misrepresent what we say.
[49:38.000 --> 49:41.360]  Well, Jones says he hates Jews and black people never play a clip.
[49:41.360 --> 49:43.360]  Not true.
[49:43.360 --> 49:46.520]  Jones says no, there's Martian bases.
[49:46.520 --> 49:47.520]  There's no clip.
[49:47.520 --> 49:50.640]  Well, it's Jones says gay frogs and then you show the scientific studies.
[49:50.640 --> 49:51.640]  Okay.
[49:51.640 --> 49:52.640]  Well, that's another thing.
[49:52.640 --> 49:54.320]  They'll take things we said out of context.
[49:54.320 --> 49:56.320]  So we're under attack.
[49:56.320 --> 49:57.320]  You're under attack.
[49:57.320 --> 49:58.320]  This is historical.
[49:58.320 --> 50:01.520]  We're winning in many ways because your instincts are strong.
[50:01.520 --> 50:02.520]  This is a big deal.
[50:02.520 --> 50:05.120]  Well, and we were talking about this during the break.
[50:05.120 --> 50:06.120]  Here's what they don't understand.
[50:06.120 --> 50:07.120]  There's no logic.
[50:07.120 --> 50:11.880]  It'd be like to make the Star Wars analogy when Anakin Skywalker goes and kills all the
[50:11.880 --> 50:13.320]  young Jedi's.
[50:13.320 --> 50:16.680]  And so then Emperor Palpatine says everybody has to turn in their lightsabers.
[50:16.680 --> 50:17.920]  No one is allowed to have a lightsaber.
[50:17.920 --> 50:18.920]  Okay.
[50:18.920 --> 50:20.640]  Well, that's essentially what the Democrats are saying.
[50:20.640 --> 50:21.640]  So let's say that all the-
[50:21.640 --> 50:26.920]  Only Darth Vader and Emperor Palpatine need weapons.
[50:26.920 --> 50:27.920]  He could trust him.
[50:27.920 --> 50:29.400]  He could trust him.
[50:29.400 --> 50:30.400]  He'll take care of you.
[50:30.400 --> 50:31.400]  Trust the Imperials.
[50:31.400 --> 50:32.880]  Trust Mao Zedong.
[50:32.880 --> 50:33.880]  Trust Hitler.
[50:33.880 --> 50:34.880]  He'll take those weapons.
[50:34.880 --> 50:36.560]  The quote will be Jones says trust Hitler.
[50:36.560 --> 50:37.560]  It's sarcastic.
[50:37.560 --> 50:38.560]  Don't trust Hitler.
[50:38.560 --> 50:43.120]  They'll take those nasty lightsabers from the Jedi's that are killing people.
[50:43.120 --> 50:44.560]  Just look what Anakin Skywalker did.
[50:44.560 --> 50:48.960]  Oh, and then you find out that that gives Darth Vader unlimited power, unlimited means,
[50:48.960 --> 50:49.960]  unlimited resources.
[50:49.960 --> 50:50.960]  So that's-
[50:50.960 --> 50:53.240]  Because there's nobody in the warrior class to opposing.
[50:53.240 --> 50:55.360]  And that's what they don't understand about the Second Amendment.
[50:55.360 --> 50:58.680]  That's what they don't understand about American history because they're not taught it.
[50:58.680 --> 51:03.280]  Because American history is about empowering the warrior, empowering the family, empowering
[51:03.280 --> 51:04.280]  the individual.
[51:04.280 --> 51:07.920]  Where the average commoner had a chance, you had to be noble to even be a knight in the
[51:07.920 --> 51:08.920]  old days.
[51:08.920 --> 51:09.920]  No.
[51:09.920 --> 51:10.920]  Every man is a knight now.
[51:10.920 --> 51:11.920]  Every woman is a knight.
[51:11.920 --> 51:12.920]  Everybody's able to defend themselves.
[51:12.920 --> 51:14.440]  You know who's not a slave?
[51:14.440 --> 51:15.920]  A man with a gun.
[51:15.920 --> 51:17.640]  A woman with a gun is not a slave.
[51:17.640 --> 51:21.640]  But again, less than 50 kids, they have the federal numbers die from shootings.
[51:21.640 --> 51:23.200]  It's still terrible.
[51:23.200 --> 51:27.480]  Thousands from car wrecks, thousands from pools, thousands from boat wrecks, thousands
[51:27.480 --> 51:32.040]  from- they just- they take it, they humanize it, and then they say, you did it.
[51:32.040 --> 51:39.880]  I am fundamentally angry, Owen, that they say my Second Amendment and my right, just
[51:39.880 --> 51:43.080]  like when a jihadi runs over somebody with a car.
[51:43.080 --> 51:47.520]  No one says he ran over somebody in a Chevy truck or a Ford truck or a Mercedes truck.
[51:47.520 --> 51:48.520]  It's not about the truck.
[51:48.520 --> 51:49.520]  It's an object.
[51:49.520 --> 51:54.240]  Like if I was a bash in the head with this coffee cup, it's not the porcelain's fault.
[51:54.240 --> 51:55.920]  Here's the big issue.
[51:55.920 --> 52:01.960]  My son Rex Jones went out just a day ago with Jake Loy, one of our reporters who shot footage
[52:01.960 --> 52:02.960]  for him.
[52:02.960 --> 52:05.360]  I appreciate Jake doing that.
[52:05.360 --> 52:06.360]  Rex wanted to do it.
[52:06.360 --> 52:09.360]  And he went out and said, you know, we got chainsaw, lug nets on guns.
[52:09.360 --> 52:11.120]  We got Oozies built inside.
[52:11.120 --> 52:12.880]  All this stuff that doesn't exist.
[52:12.880 --> 52:16.680]  And the Democrats all agreed outside the gun march.
[52:16.680 --> 52:17.680]  It's up there.
[52:17.680 --> 52:18.680]  So this is before the gun march.
[52:18.680 --> 52:19.920]  You were there later in the day.
[52:19.920 --> 52:21.200]  It's all right there.
[52:21.200 --> 52:23.920]  Liberals want to ban guns that don't exist in FullWars.com.
[52:23.920 --> 52:24.920]  And I did this.
[52:24.920 --> 52:28.920]  I knew he wanted to go out and do it himself to illustrate how they're not even bad people.
[52:28.920 --> 52:30.680]  They will buy anything, Owen.
[52:30.680 --> 52:35.040]  Yeah, it's just sad that this is what has happened to the average mind of an American
[52:35.040 --> 52:36.600]  that they'll fall for anything.
[52:36.600 --> 52:39.760]  And when you don't know what you stand for, you'll fall for anything.
[52:39.760 --> 52:40.880]  That's how the old saying goes.
[52:40.880 --> 52:42.120]  They don't know what they stand for.
[52:42.120 --> 52:45.280]  That's why you can't ask them, hey, what are you out here protesting?
[52:45.280 --> 52:46.280]  And they don't know.
[52:46.280 --> 52:49.280]  Hey, what do you think, you know, what kind of gun control measures do you think need
[52:49.280 --> 52:50.280]  to happen?
[52:50.280 --> 52:51.280]  Go away.
[52:51.280 --> 52:52.280]  F you, Infowars.
[52:52.280 --> 52:53.280]  Well, okay.
[52:53.280 --> 52:54.280]  So that doesn't really help you at all.
[52:54.280 --> 52:55.600]  That doesn't really help anything.
[52:55.600 --> 52:58.120]  So what Rex does in this video is so great.
[52:58.120 --> 53:02.200]  He just shows, oh my gosh, that girl was in my video too.
[53:02.200 --> 53:05.320]  He just illustrates how they literally will fall for anything.
[53:05.320 --> 53:06.800]  They literally will fall for anything.
[53:06.800 --> 53:10.760]  There's an Uzi built within the handle and there's a button with a chainsaw that shoots
[53:10.760 --> 53:11.760]  out.
[53:11.760 --> 53:12.760]  I want that band.
[53:12.760 --> 53:13.760]  It's the same thing.
[53:13.760 --> 53:17.280]  Hey, here's Bernie Sanders' tax bill and then you read off Trump's tax bill.
[53:17.280 --> 53:18.280]  Where's the thing?
[53:18.280 --> 53:21.320]  They don't know about history or corrupt groups or people that aren't independent.
[53:21.320 --> 53:25.680]  They think like there's this big global group and George Soros wants to help them.
[53:25.680 --> 53:31.480]  This is what I always try to tell the youth and Rex is a good example of this.
[53:31.480 --> 53:38.360]  If you study and read and understand things and are well-spoken, you are literally miles
[53:38.360 --> 53:40.520]  ahead of the rest of your peers.
[53:40.520 --> 53:42.480]  Oh, they call it insider trading.
[53:42.480 --> 53:46.760]  I'm not even involved in the stock market, but I've told people positions before just
[53:46.760 --> 53:48.080]  around the office and show them what's going to happen.
[53:48.080 --> 53:49.760]  They're like, God, that one up 20% in a week.
[53:49.760 --> 53:51.400]  How'd you know?
[53:51.400 --> 53:53.600]  Because when you know this stuff, you know everything.
[53:53.600 --> 53:54.600]  They're tuned in.
[53:54.600 --> 53:55.600]  They don't want you tuned in.
[53:55.600 --> 53:59.280]  They just want you to have some mindless bot that gets whatever energy it has that gives
[53:59.280 --> 54:00.280]  it up to them.
[54:00.280 --> 54:01.480]  Exactly.
[54:01.480 --> 54:02.480]  That's why I always tell you.
[54:02.480 --> 54:06.440]  I'm like, look, most of them disagree with me, but at least can talk to me or willing
[54:06.440 --> 54:07.440]  to have a conversation.
[54:07.440 --> 54:08.440]  Seem open-minded.
[54:08.440 --> 54:11.960]  I'm like, look, just being open-minded and being willing to have a conversation and
[54:11.960 --> 54:12.960]  debate.
[54:12.960 --> 54:17.120]  What about the folks that stopped you for hours and even when you were nice and let them talk
[54:17.120 --> 54:20.600]  for like 30 minutes, they wouldn't leave you alone and try to stop your interviews?
[54:20.600 --> 54:21.600]  They're anti-free speech.
[54:21.600 --> 54:25.480]  They kept saying, I want to make sure you don't harass women.
[54:25.480 --> 54:26.480]  It's like this thing.
[54:26.480 --> 54:28.240]  Men can't talk to women.
[54:28.240 --> 54:32.000]  It works perfect for me because then the youth sees that and I say, do you want to be like
[54:32.000 --> 54:33.200]  this loser when you're older?
[54:33.200 --> 54:35.440]  Do you want to be like this psycho when you're older?
[54:35.440 --> 54:38.840]  And of course they see that and it kind of hits home to them and they're like, wait a
[54:38.840 --> 54:39.840]  second.
[54:39.840 --> 54:41.840]  Let me tell you, I don't just have to be positive.
[54:41.840 --> 54:42.840]  People know I don't hype stuff.
[54:42.840 --> 54:43.840]  We're down.
[54:43.840 --> 54:44.840]  I tell you, we're down.
[54:44.840 --> 54:45.840]  But we're starting to get up.
[54:45.840 --> 54:46.840]  I tell you, we're up.
[54:46.840 --> 54:51.040]  My kids are in sports, so they're in private school, but they play public schools.
[54:51.040 --> 54:52.040]  I go there.
[54:52.040 --> 54:53.040]  It's like incredible.
[54:53.040 --> 54:54.040]  They love Steven Crowder.
[54:54.040 --> 54:55.040]  They love Paul Watson.
[54:55.040 --> 54:56.040]  They love you.
[54:56.040 --> 54:57.040]  They love me.
[54:57.040 --> 54:58.560]  They're like hog.
[54:58.560 --> 55:00.040]  He's a front for Hollywood.
[55:00.040 --> 55:01.040]  Screw those old people.
[55:01.040 --> 55:03.440]  That's what Hollywood gets that though.
[55:03.440 --> 55:04.440]  They're trying to be cool.
[55:04.440 --> 55:05.440]  Look, we got kids.
[55:05.440 --> 55:11.280]  They kids know, man, their professors, their teachers are all brainwashing them so they
[55:11.280 --> 55:12.280]  go to us.
[55:12.280 --> 55:13.920]  We're not even doing the work.
[55:13.920 --> 55:15.800]  That's what the left doesn't get.
[55:15.800 --> 55:16.800]  Don't you get it?
[55:16.800 --> 55:18.840]  We're the counterculture dumbasses.
[55:18.840 --> 55:22.520]  Well, I don't know if they'll ever get it if they haven't gotten it by now to be honest
[55:22.520 --> 55:24.400]  with you because I think they're so.
[55:24.400 --> 55:30.040]  I think they're so just full delusional delusion, they're in their own world invested too.
[55:30.040 --> 55:33.960]  They're fully invested in their committed and but I'll say they're dangerous.
[55:33.960 --> 55:35.640]  I'm not saying we're even going to win.
[55:35.640 --> 55:36.640]  Here's the thing.
[55:36.640 --> 55:38.120]  We told we told you when Trump won.
[55:38.120 --> 55:39.120]  This is just the beginning.
[55:39.120 --> 55:40.120]  He's not even perfect.
[55:40.120 --> 55:41.120]  He's not a dictator.
[55:41.120 --> 55:42.120]  He can't do it all.
[55:42.120 --> 55:43.560]  You know, I get that it's an omnibus.
[55:43.560 --> 55:44.560]  It's not a budget.
[55:44.560 --> 55:45.560]  Same thing.
[55:45.560 --> 55:46.920]  I get that it's not that good of a deal.
[55:46.920 --> 55:49.360]  We got Stefan Malinu that's on tomorrow piss.
[55:49.360 --> 55:54.880]  We got so many people on certain of which is coming on that's pissed off at Trump.
[55:54.880 --> 55:55.880]  I get it.
[55:55.880 --> 55:56.880]  I have problems too.
[55:56.880 --> 55:57.880]  We'll have a debate tomorrow.
[55:57.880 --> 55:58.880]  11 a.m. to 3 p.m.
[55:58.880 --> 55:59.880]  You've got the war room.
[55:59.880 --> 56:01.120]  David, I'll be on the morning cover and all.
[56:01.120 --> 56:03.000]  But the point is history is happening now.
[56:03.000 --> 56:04.000]  The battle's on.
[56:04.000 --> 56:07.280]  We're the vanguard in this fight and just to spend a minute and a half here where we
[56:07.280 --> 56:08.780]  go to break.
[56:08.780 --> 56:10.280]  Without you, we're not here.
[56:10.280 --> 56:12.320]  The global has stored sorrows, the Democratic Party.
[56:12.320 --> 56:13.320]  They're all suing us.
[56:13.320 --> 56:14.680]  They're trying to shut down the free speech.
[56:14.680 --> 56:15.680]  They're failing.
[56:15.680 --> 56:17.560]  The lawyers all say it's totally fraudulent.
[56:17.560 --> 56:19.800]  They'll beat it easily, but it still takes money.
[56:19.800 --> 56:22.080]  Hundreds of thousands per suit to beat it.
[56:22.080 --> 56:23.200]  Go get water filters.
[56:23.200 --> 56:24.200]  Go get air filters.
[56:24.200 --> 56:25.720]  Go get non-GMO air lymph seeds.

[56:45.040 --> 56:46.040]  God, I forgot to add that.

[57:01.160 --> 57:06.320]  You are standing against sorrows and the globalist and everything they do when you spread an
[57:06.320 --> 57:09.800]  article, when you spread a video, I was sitting there with all these young girls, friends
[57:09.800 --> 57:13.080]  of my daughters, driving back from Six Flags to today.
[57:13.080 --> 57:17.640]  They were all like, look at this crap on my feed, this hashtag, this hashtag, turn your
[57:17.640 --> 57:18.640]  guns in.
[57:18.640 --> 57:19.640]  And I said counter it.
[57:19.640 --> 57:20.960]  They go, well, my daddy doesn't let me.
[57:20.960 --> 57:22.160]  Well, that's fine.
[57:22.160 --> 57:26.080]  But again, all these other leftist kids don't have daddies.
[57:26.080 --> 57:27.480]  And that's the answer.
[57:27.480 --> 57:31.200]  All of us have to release and speak out and stand up and we will win.
[57:31.200 --> 57:32.200]  Period.
[57:32.200 --> 57:33.200]  All right.

[59:53.840 --> 1:00:03.840]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:00:03.840 --> 1:00:08.080]  George Soros is openly spending hundreds of millions for this anti-gun march, the Nazi
[1:00:08.080 --> 1:00:13.120]  collaborator, and if you watch the incredible videos that John Bown has bowled down from
[1:00:13.120 --> 1:00:19.160]  C-SPAN, they directly attack us, Daniel Loach, the NRA, you name it, trying to get the crowd
[1:00:19.160 --> 1:00:23.240]  of young people into a frenzy against us.
[1:00:23.240 --> 1:00:27.000]  So Owen's coming up, I'm coming up, we're going to break all this down, got other guests
[1:00:27.000 --> 1:00:30.920]  coming on, a bunch of clips, but right now let's look at the demonization that's taking
[1:00:30.920 --> 1:00:34.520]  place against those of us that defend the Second Amendment as they launch the biggest
[1:00:34.520 --> 1:00:37.640]  attack in history against our basic right.
[1:00:37.640 --> 1:00:41.120]  What separates mainstream media from blatant propaganda?
[1:00:41.120 --> 1:00:46.880]  800 marches are planned for Saturday, from Bismarck to Salt Lake City, Memphis to Springfield,
[1:00:46.880 --> 1:00:54.000]  Virginia, and everywhere in between, children now taking on a very adult topic, politics,
[1:00:54.000 --> 1:00:56.640]  and hoping they can teach the grown-ups a lesson.
[1:00:56.640 --> 1:01:02.040]  The lopsided coverage of the march for life was anything but objective, but don't take
[1:01:02.040 --> 1:01:08.160]  my word for it, here's gun grabber and chief Senator Dianne Feinstein from California with
[1:01:08.160 --> 1:01:09.160]  more.
[1:01:09.160 --> 1:01:12.480]  Let's bring in a prominent member of the United States, Senator Dianne Feinstein of
[1:01:12.480 --> 1:01:17.240]  California, she's in San Francisco right now, Dianne, thank you for joining us, Senator.
[1:01:17.240 --> 1:01:21.080]  What's it like out there today, it's wild here in Washington?
[1:01:21.080 --> 1:01:29.080]  Well, it's the first day of spring, people are here, the program hasn't begun yet.
[1:01:29.080 --> 1:01:35.920]  I want people to know is that we have introduced an assault weapons ban.
[1:01:35.920 --> 1:01:41.600]  My office wrote it, but we have 30 co-sponsors, it's in the Judiciary Committee.
[1:01:41.600 --> 1:01:50.680]  We are asking for a hearing, problem is, we need 60, and we don't have a single Republican.
[1:01:50.680 --> 1:01:56.440]  And you've got to get the military weapon off of the streets and out of the schools
[1:01:56.440 --> 1:01:59.960]  and out of circulation, I deeply believe that.
[1:01:59.960 --> 1:02:04.520]  Even the presentation during the March for Life rally in Washington, D.C. subjected the
[1:02:04.520 --> 1:02:08.080]  participants with no-thigh-enemies-style expositions.
[1:02:08.080 --> 1:02:12.400]  They use their schools to teach children that their president is another Hitler.
[1:02:12.400 --> 1:02:17.000]  Hitler took the guns, Stalin took the guns, if you try to take our firearms, it doesn't
[1:02:17.000 --> 1:02:20.280]  matter how many lemmings you get out there on the street begging for them to have their
[1:02:20.280 --> 1:02:22.760]  guns taken, we will not relinquish them.
[1:02:22.760 --> 1:02:27.440]  They use their movie stars and singers and comedy shows and award shows to repeat their
[1:02:27.440 --> 1:02:29.680]  narrative over and over again.
[1:02:29.680 --> 1:02:34.080]  What matters is who the enemy is, they're the no-gun people, period.
[1:02:34.080 --> 1:02:40.920]  Listen up, you might have met our fresh-faced flower child, President, we need Ivy League
[1:02:40.920 --> 1:02:41.920]  friends.
[1:02:41.920 --> 1:02:55.000]  The only truly free people who have ever walked this earth have been armed people.
[1:02:55.000 --> 1:03:10.320]  You are either with us or against us at this point.
[1:03:10.320 --> 1:03:23.000]  High school students are refusing to let thoughts and prayers be the end of the school.
[1:03:23.000 --> 1:03:27.920]  If a change is going to be made, whatever that may be, then it can only be accomplished
[1:03:27.920 --> 1:03:32.360]  by a come-to-the-table discussion by both sides of the issue.
[1:03:32.360 --> 1:03:34.600]  And as a parent, you protect children.
[1:03:34.600 --> 1:03:38.880]  You protect them until they're mature enough, you protect them until they're emotionally
[1:03:38.880 --> 1:03:42.640]  mature enough, physically mature enough, until they can make decisions for themselves.
[1:03:42.640 --> 1:03:47.760]  What you don't do, Grant, is exploit children to make the arguments that either you yourself
[1:03:47.760 --> 1:03:52.640]  can't make or that you want to make, but sounds inarticulate and inappropriate coming
[1:03:52.640 --> 1:03:56.840]  out of the mouth of a 40- or 50-year-old anti-gun advocate.
[1:03:56.840 --> 1:04:00.280]  And that's the problem that we're looking at here, and that's why no one really in
[1:04:00.280 --> 1:04:04.120]  the media wants to talk about some of the people who are taking part in organizing the
[1:04:04.120 --> 1:04:05.120]  event.
[1:04:05.120 --> 1:04:08.920]  I just saw a press release that went out with Everytown in Mom's Demand, and I will
[1:04:08.920 --> 1:04:13.120]  have you know, Everytown is a huge fan of Stop and Frisk, and this is an organization
[1:04:13.120 --> 1:04:18.640]  along with Mom's Demand that have consistently rejected the idea of any kind of safety measures
[1:04:18.640 --> 1:04:23.240]  at all whatsoever, while simultaneously saying that law-abiding gun-owning Americans like
[1:04:23.240 --> 1:04:28.800]  myself somehow don't have any solutions for safety, when yet I've approached them repeatedly
[1:04:28.800 --> 1:04:33.520]  to work with organizations perhaps maybe like Eddie Eagle or School Shield or Project Child
[1:04:33.520 --> 1:04:37.640]  Safe, and they've rejected every single overture, so I have to kind of question where their
[1:04:37.640 --> 1:04:39.040]  true intent lies.
[1:04:39.040 --> 1:04:44.040]  The March for Life made it abundantly clear that their developing message has already
[1:04:44.040 --> 1:04:49.520]  been hijacked by the gun-grabbers in Congress, the media, and the sycophants of the United
[1:04:49.520 --> 1:04:51.680]  Nations Arms Trade Treaty.
[1:04:51.680 --> 1:04:55.040]  John Baum reporting for InfoWars.com.
[1:04:55.040 --> 1:05:05.280]  I'm so excited, the new product at InfoWarsLife.com, in a glass bottle, two-month servings filled
[1:05:05.280 --> 1:05:10.120]  to the brim, filled to the absolute top, the real red pill.
[1:05:10.120 --> 1:05:15.600]  This is a heart and brain pill, a new tropic that doesn't have any stimulants in it, but
[1:05:15.600 --> 1:05:18.560]  boy does it stimulate because it's beyond that.
[1:05:18.560 --> 1:05:24.520]  Quite frankly, I just went off what I saw medical doctors prescribing to their patients,
[1:05:24.520 --> 1:05:31.160]  but it wasn't prescription, but they were charging people $100, $200 for the formulae,
[1:05:31.160 --> 1:05:34.800]  and I came up with our own formulae working with some scientists and developers.
[1:05:34.800 --> 1:05:41.880]  One GMO made right here in America, 120 capsules, and ladies and gentlemen, you add the preglinone
[1:05:41.880 --> 1:05:47.280]  to it, which is the precursor to all the hormones that your body has to have to even make the
[1:05:47.280 --> 1:05:49.000]  hormones in your glands.
[1:05:49.000 --> 1:05:51.800]  It is amazing.
[1:05:51.800 --> 1:06:03.840]  Red pill now available at InfoWarsStore.com, and your purchase fugs the operation.
[1:06:03.840 --> 1:06:25.520]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, Alex Jones has checked out for the Sunday show.
[1:06:25.520 --> 1:06:31.160]  Of course, he'll be back fired up as usual for the weekly broadcast, four hours, the
[1:06:31.160 --> 1:06:39.360]  Alex Jones show 11-3, but I've got some headlines I want to cover here, and then at the bottom
[1:06:39.360 --> 1:06:45.520]  of the hour, we're going to play Rex Jones going out on the streets, talking to liberals
[1:06:45.520 --> 1:06:47.400]  about guns that don't exist.
[1:06:47.400 --> 1:06:51.960]  Yes, they want to ban guns that don't exist, so that's going to be rich, and then I have
[1:06:51.960 --> 1:07:00.760]  a boil down of my two hours of live broadcasting from the March for Our Lives in Austin, Texas.
[1:07:00.760 --> 1:07:06.320]  Now, I got to tell you, it's really strange because I edit this boil down, but it's really
[1:07:06.320 --> 1:07:09.000]  strange reliving it through the editing process.
[1:07:09.000 --> 1:07:15.280]  When you're actually there, I'm in the zone and I'm reporting, I mean, literally both
[1:07:15.280 --> 1:07:17.280]  my hands are tied.
[1:07:17.280 --> 1:07:21.440]  They're showing a video, a clip of this right now, but I go back and when I'm reviewing
[1:07:21.440 --> 1:07:24.440]  this, it's even more insane than I remember.
[1:07:24.440 --> 1:07:28.360]  It's like, I'm going back and I'm thinking, okay, here were some of the highlights, here's
[1:07:28.360 --> 1:07:33.520]  what I'll put in the video, and then I watch the full two hours and I'm like, my gosh,
[1:07:33.520 --> 1:07:35.560]  like the whole two hours is insane.
[1:07:35.560 --> 1:07:40.040]  Like if I wanted to actually boil it down to a highlight from two hours, it'd still
[1:07:40.040 --> 1:07:43.600]  be like an hour and a half, but we're going to have some boil downs.
[1:07:43.600 --> 1:07:47.040]  I'm going to put out some other edits as well, so you can just review the madness that is
[1:07:47.040 --> 1:07:51.240]  these liberals that are marching against their rights.
[1:07:51.240 --> 1:07:54.960]  They're literally marching against their rights, but let me just hit some of these
[1:07:54.960 --> 1:07:59.880]  headlines here just to show you some of the hypocrisy.
[1:07:59.880 --> 1:08:04.000]  This is from Breitbart, celebrities hit the streets to support student gun control march,
[1:08:04.000 --> 1:08:05.000]  vote them all out.
[1:08:05.000 --> 1:08:09.880]  Well, the funny thing is, at this point, I'm kind of willing to vote out about 80% of
[1:08:09.880 --> 1:08:10.880]  Congress as well.
[1:08:10.880 --> 1:08:13.720]  I mean, the Republican Party is a total joke.
[1:08:13.720 --> 1:08:19.920]  The only ones that seem to be conservatives are Rand Paul, Jim Jordan, a handful of others.
[1:08:19.920 --> 1:08:26.640]  But so you've got Jim Carrey, you've got other stars out there, apparently George Clooney,
[1:08:26.640 --> 1:08:29.760]  they're pledging millions and millions of dollars to these events.
[1:08:29.760 --> 1:08:36.360]  Oh, but how much do you want to bet that every single one of those celebrities that was out
[1:08:36.360 --> 1:08:41.160]  on the streets with the marchers was protected by armed guards?
[1:08:41.160 --> 1:08:44.880]  You think for one second that any of these celebrities are going to go on the streets
[1:08:44.880 --> 1:08:47.280]  of America without armed security?
[1:08:47.280 --> 1:08:49.400]  You are nuts.
[1:08:49.400 --> 1:09:00.320]  So here's the biggest hypocrites in America protected by guns that then go out on a massive
[1:09:00.320 --> 1:09:06.200]  globalist platform and say, turn in the guns, gun control now, and then has armed security
[1:09:06.200 --> 1:09:09.160]  escort them out of the event.
[1:09:09.160 --> 1:09:17.360]  And somehow, even though the hypocrisy is so blatant, so in your face, somehow these
[1:09:17.360 --> 1:09:22.320]  liberals still fall for it because they're brainwashed and they don't stand for anything.
[1:09:22.320 --> 1:09:25.120]  If you don't stand for anything, you'll fall for anything.
[1:09:25.120 --> 1:09:30.960]  And they do fall for anything, including banning a weapon that doesn't exist and listening
[1:09:30.960 --> 1:09:35.800]  to an individual about turning your guns in, who is protected by armed security around
[1:09:35.800 --> 1:09:40.680]  the clock and has a wall around his house.
[1:09:40.680 --> 1:09:44.580]  I mean, seriously, folks, this is so basic common sense.
[1:09:44.580 --> 1:09:51.800]  The only way to explain it is that the left, the liberal minions, are literally brainwashed.
[1:09:51.800 --> 1:09:53.640]  And that's not our rhetoric.
[1:09:53.640 --> 1:09:55.280]  Listen to what Eric Holder says.
[1:09:55.280 --> 1:09:58.680]  We have to literally brainwash the public into thinking differently about guns.
[1:09:58.680 --> 1:10:03.560]  He says we're going to do it in all the schools every day, all day, every school.
[1:10:03.560 --> 1:10:04.560]  And then what do you get?
[1:10:04.560 --> 1:10:09.120]  A bunch of indoctrinated students who march against their own rights.
[1:10:09.120 --> 1:10:10.480]  That's the Democrat brainwashing.
[1:10:10.480 --> 1:10:11.960]  They told you that would happen.
[1:10:11.960 --> 1:10:16.080]  And then they take the biggest phonies on earth who get escorted in with armed security,
[1:10:16.080 --> 1:10:20.040]  say take the guns, gun control now, and then get escorted out with armed security.
[1:10:20.040 --> 1:10:26.080]  And then all the brainwashed minions indoctrinated by the public school say, yeah, oh my gosh,
[1:10:26.080 --> 1:10:28.960]  he's so righteous, he's such a good guy.
[1:10:28.960 --> 1:10:35.120]  And then he gives you a big fat middle finger as he walks away in his armed security.
[1:10:35.120 --> 1:10:37.440]  So that's fine.
[1:10:37.440 --> 1:10:38.760]  What's next?
[1:10:38.760 --> 1:10:43.600]  Research for our lives will start a revolution, says Parkland School Shooting Survivor.
[1:10:43.600 --> 1:10:46.400]  Oh yeah, oh, you're going to get your revolution, bud.
[1:10:46.400 --> 1:10:47.840]  You're going to get your revolution.
[1:10:47.840 --> 1:10:50.360]  You're going to get your Nazi style revolution.
[1:10:50.360 --> 1:10:51.360]  That's what you want.
[1:10:51.360 --> 1:10:52.360]  You're the Nazis.
[1:10:52.360 --> 1:10:53.360]  You're the Brownshirts.
[1:10:53.360 --> 1:10:56.520]  You're the Maul Brigade.
[1:10:56.520 --> 1:10:59.120]  Where does it end?
[1:10:59.120 --> 1:11:00.640]  You know what the revolution is, folks?
[1:11:00.640 --> 1:11:04.480]  They just kill us all.
[1:11:04.480 --> 1:11:10.200]  You don't think for one second that these anti-gun liberals would gladly burn every
[1:11:10.200 --> 1:11:14.080]  NRA member to death, just like the Nazis did to the Jews?
[1:11:14.080 --> 1:11:15.720]  That's their hatred.
[1:11:15.720 --> 1:11:20.960]  That's their fomented hatred by the Democrats, by the propaganda, absolutely.
[1:11:20.960 --> 1:11:23.320]  And now you understand why we're pro-second amendment.
[1:11:23.320 --> 1:11:27.600]  Now you understand why we have guns, because I've got radical liberals in this country
[1:11:27.600 --> 1:11:31.600]  that would gladly burn me to death in a gas chamber.
[1:11:31.600 --> 1:11:32.600]  Absolutely they would.
[1:11:32.600 --> 1:11:38.320]  That's why they go out on the streets, march against guns, because of the propaganda of
[1:11:38.320 --> 1:11:42.440]  the Democrat Party that Eric Holder announced years ago.
[1:11:42.440 --> 1:11:48.640]  And just like Hitler, then they stage events, use those events to demonize their enemies
[1:11:48.640 --> 1:11:54.360]  and then say, we have to take the guns, literally, literally the Nazi playbook.
[1:11:54.360 --> 1:12:01.000]  I mean, literally play for play right out of the Nazi playbook.
[1:12:01.000 --> 1:12:07.360]  And to make it even more crazy, I mean, as if that wasn't crazy enough, then their next
[1:12:07.360 --> 1:12:11.760]  march is going to be Trump as Hitler.
[1:12:11.760 --> 1:12:15.320]  And you want to turn the guns into Hitler?
[1:12:15.320 --> 1:12:19.560]  So yeah, you're trying to start a revolution, for sure, just like the Nazis did to kill
[1:12:19.560 --> 1:12:20.560]  the Jews.
[1:12:20.560 --> 1:12:21.760]  That's what you're doing on the left.
[1:12:21.760 --> 1:12:23.640]  You want to kill conservatives and gun owners.
[1:12:23.640 --> 1:12:28.920]  That's your revolution, you're violent, you're hateful, you're ignorant, you're uninformed,
[1:12:28.920 --> 1:12:31.280]  you're brainwashed.
[1:12:31.280 --> 1:12:34.720]  Again, we don't even talk about some of the stuff we put up with around here, folks, but
[1:12:34.720 --> 1:12:39.200]  there's a reason why we're staunch Second Amendment activists.
[1:12:39.200 --> 1:12:42.720]  Here's from the Gateway Punnett, David Hogg rallies, Democrats in DC.
[1:12:42.720 --> 1:12:46.800]  If you listen real close, you can hear the people in power shaking, really?
[1:12:46.800 --> 1:12:52.960]  Really because you're proposing to give all the guns over to the people in power.
[1:12:52.960 --> 1:12:55.080]  Why would they be shaking, David Hogg?
[1:12:55.080 --> 1:12:58.920]  Why would the people in power be shaking, David Hogg, if you are trying to give them
[1:12:58.920 --> 1:13:01.720]  all the guns?
[1:13:01.720 --> 1:13:03.720]  Think about it.
[1:13:03.720 --> 1:13:06.960]  He says if you listen real close, the people in power are shaking.
[1:13:06.960 --> 1:13:10.960]  You want to give the guns to all the people in power, so why would they be the ones shaking?
[1:13:10.960 --> 1:13:16.600]  The ones shaking are going to be the citizens of this country that lose their right to bear
[1:13:16.600 --> 1:13:21.880]  arms, lose their right to self-protection, women, children, families, they're all going
[1:13:21.880 --> 1:13:28.000]  to lose their rights to protection because of you, David Hogg, and then the power structure
[1:13:28.000 --> 1:13:33.000]  that you claim is shaking is going to be the one with all the guns and then they're going
[1:13:33.000 --> 1:13:34.960]  to bring in their authoritarian regime.
[1:13:34.960 --> 1:13:36.400]  That's how this works.
[1:13:36.400 --> 1:13:42.640]  So is David Hogg a complete moron or is he a stooge?
[1:13:42.640 --> 1:13:50.920]  Is he being fed party lines from the Democrats, from the FBI?
[1:13:50.920 --> 1:13:54.480]  You can hear the people in power shaking as we want to give the people in power all the
[1:13:54.480 --> 1:13:55.480]  guns.
[1:13:55.480 --> 1:13:59.200]  Trump is Hitler and we want to give Hitler all the guns.
[1:13:59.200 --> 1:14:03.280]  We're anti-fascists, but we want to hand all the guns into the government just like
[1:14:03.280 --> 1:14:06.360]  a fascist regime would do.
[1:14:06.360 --> 1:14:10.040]  And then somehow I'm the crazy one according to these people when I go out on the streets
[1:14:10.040 --> 1:14:12.800]  and we'll have the video, we got the video, we're going to play the video at the bottom
[1:14:12.800 --> 1:14:13.800]  of the hour.
[1:14:13.800 --> 1:14:20.120]  Oh, but whoa, oh my gosh, but stop the presses because 60 minutes is going to interview a
[1:14:20.120 --> 1:14:21.760]  porn star tonight.
[1:14:21.760 --> 1:14:28.200]  Oh yeah, Stormy Daniels attorney sends a warning shot to Trump, it's time to come clean.
[1:14:28.200 --> 1:14:33.040]  Well, congratulations to Stormy Daniels for being smarter than the media.
[1:14:33.040 --> 1:14:38.320]  So now a porn star has literally outsmarted the mainstream liberal media.
[1:14:38.320 --> 1:14:45.560]  A porn star is now smarter than the average liberal media outlet and she has totally,
[1:14:45.560 --> 1:14:50.880]  totally pawned them all to promote her own show, her own whatever.
[1:14:50.880 --> 1:14:55.760]  So now Stormy Daniels is smarter than the average liberal on television as she's using
[1:14:55.760 --> 1:15:00.680]  them all right now to promote her own agenda.
[1:15:00.680 --> 1:15:04.280]  As if any of this is going to bring Trump down, this is what I was saying earlier.
[1:15:04.280 --> 1:15:07.840]  If the liberal media understood anything about trying to bring Trump down, they'd be talking
[1:15:07.840 --> 1:15:11.720]  about this omnibus spending bill, but they don't want to complain about that.
[1:15:11.720 --> 1:15:15.560]  See, they can't complain about that because it's their bill.
[1:15:15.560 --> 1:15:20.080]  So if they complain about the omnibus bill, they're complaining about their own bill that
[1:15:20.080 --> 1:15:21.080]  funds Planned Parenthood.
[1:15:21.080 --> 1:15:22.440]  So they can't do that.
[1:15:22.440 --> 1:15:28.280]  So instead they interview a porn star on CNN, Anderson Cooper on CNN, Anderson Cooper on
[1:15:28.280 --> 1:15:34.520]  60 minutes and they somehow mythically think that this is going to turn the Republic against
[1:15:34.520 --> 1:15:38.320]  Trump when nobody gives a damn.
[1:15:38.320 --> 1:15:42.440]  Nobody gives a damn about who Trump slept with and when.
[1:15:42.440 --> 1:15:46.240]  What we want is a government that puts America first.
[1:15:46.240 --> 1:15:50.440]  What we want is a bill of rights and we're sick of politicians trying to do everything
[1:15:50.440 --> 1:15:52.360]  they can to infringe upon it.
[1:15:52.360 --> 1:15:53.360]  That's what we want.
[1:15:53.360 --> 1:15:56.800]  It's not that confusing and a porn star is not going to stop that from happening.
[1:15:56.800 --> 1:16:00.680]  After being sold out for months, our best selling Super Blue Florida toothpaste is now
[1:16:00.680 --> 1:16:05.600]  back in stock at M4store.com, the first shipment of Super Blue sold out in one week.
[1:16:05.600 --> 1:16:07.640]  I thought it would be a six month supply for listeners.
[1:16:07.640 --> 1:16:11.840]  And since then, people are beating down our doors wanting to be able to resupply their
[1:16:11.840 --> 1:16:12.840]  Super Blue.
[1:16:12.840 --> 1:16:14.720]  Research across the board is clear.
[1:16:14.720 --> 1:16:16.080]  In fact, it's certified.
[1:16:16.080 --> 1:16:20.000]  When bacteria infect your gums, it can enter your bloodstream and even contribute to blood
[1:16:20.000 --> 1:16:21.240]  clots and heart attacks.
[1:16:21.240 --> 1:16:25.640]  That's why the last Surgeon General's report on oral health warns that your oral health
[1:16:25.640 --> 1:16:28.000]  can have a serious impact on your entire body.
[1:16:28.000 --> 1:16:32.360]  Super Blue fluoride free toothpaste is a groundbreaking new formula that's loaded with good halogen
[1:16:32.360 --> 1:16:34.600]  iodide, some of the bad halogen fluoride.
[1:16:34.600 --> 1:16:39.280]  Super Blue contains natural oils and ingredients used since biblical times to help wipe out
[1:16:39.280 --> 1:16:41.720]  bad bacteria and eliminate bad breath.
[1:16:41.720 --> 1:16:45.680]  Just some of the ingredients in Super Blue chosen by our dental experts include silo
[1:16:45.680 --> 1:16:49.280]  tall, peppermint oil, iodide, nano silver and more.
[1:16:49.280 --> 1:16:54.360]  Learn more about Info Wars Life Super Blue toothpaste at InfoWarsLife.com and support

[1:16:57.280 --> 1:17:00.080]  It's been sold out for months and now it's back.
[1:17:00.080 --> 1:17:06.440]  It's MycoZX Plus, lower price, more ingredients because we scaled up, signed to your contract
[1:17:06.440 --> 1:17:10.680]  with an even bigger organic manufacturer and producer.
[1:17:10.680 --> 1:17:11.680]  Scalability.
[1:17:11.680 --> 1:17:17.360]  But now we're able to go at 50% off to $27 instead of $39, 50% off because there's a
[1:17:17.360 --> 1:17:20.080]  lot of product and a lot of ingredient, MycoZX.
[1:17:20.080 --> 1:17:23.760]  Now it's the other side of the equation, everybody thinks about probiotics, now great
[1:17:23.760 --> 1:17:27.880]  they are for your gut because of toxins in the environment, pesticides, herbicides.
[1:17:27.880 --> 1:17:32.040]  But more importantly than bad bacteria, the probiotics help displace.
[1:17:32.040 --> 1:17:38.280]  Yeast mold creates slime walls and once the candida and the yeast and the mold and all
[1:17:38.280 --> 1:17:42.680]  that get in there, it causes all sorts of syrups, this has got a bunch of concentrated herbs
[1:17:42.680 --> 1:17:47.240]  in it and compounds known to destroy that slime wall.
[1:17:47.240 --> 1:17:49.520]  Don't wait to start detoxifying your body until it's too late.

[1:18:02.000 --> 1:18:07.120]  enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[1:18:07.120 --> 1:18:11.160]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern
[1:18:11.160 --> 1:18:15.520]  Mexico where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[1:18:15.520 --> 1:18:20.840]  We have now managed to secure these sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[1:18:20.840 --> 1:18:27.240]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% organic coffee at infowarslife.com.

[1:18:32.360 --> 1:18:34.240]  that so many other coffees give me personally.
[1:18:34.240 --> 1:18:38.760]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee and it's taken us years to secure connections
[1:18:38.760 --> 1:18:41.360]  directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[1:18:41.360 --> 1:18:46.200]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[1:18:46.200 --> 1:18:49.280]  Available in original or with our immune support infusion blend.

[1:18:58.120 --> 1:19:03.360]  InfoWarslife is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine, introducing pollen block.
[1:19:03.360 --> 1:19:08.560]  We have found an extraordinary new, natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms
[1:19:08.560 --> 1:19:15.360]  including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort and respiratory function.
[1:19:15.360 --> 1:19:21.240]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced
[1:19:21.240 --> 1:19:24.560]  less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[1:19:24.560 --> 1:19:29.480]  They began studying this effect in published trials and decades later we now have the fruit
[1:19:29.480 --> 1:19:35.560]  of this research, a fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[1:19:35.560 --> 1:19:39.440]  Pollen block is natural and effective, it is not an antihistamine.
[1:19:39.440 --> 1:19:44.160]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of
[1:19:44.160 --> 1:19:49.960]  triptase which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[1:19:49.960 --> 1:19:52.680]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.
[1:19:52.680 --> 1:20:10.120]  Like to infowarslife.com and grab a pack of our pollen block chewable tablets.
[1:20:10.120 --> 1:20:24.640]  Broadcasting live from the UN Stronghold, Austin, Texas, you're listening to the Alex Jones
[1:20:24.640 --> 1:20:30.360]  show and now your host, Owen Troyer.
[1:20:30.360 --> 1:20:45.080]  Alright, just running down these final headlines before we premiere the Rex Jones video, getting
[1:20:45.080 --> 1:20:49.640]  liberals to admit they want to ban guns that don't exist, again they'll fall for anything.
[1:20:49.640 --> 1:20:55.440]  And then my boil down from my live coverage of the March for Our Lives in Austin, Texas
[1:20:55.440 --> 1:20:59.960]  on Saturday, just a brief boil down, there'll be a couple more videos I put out probably
[1:20:59.960 --> 1:21:03.760]  tomorrow just showing you the craziness.
[1:21:03.760 --> 1:21:06.840]  Because even in this ten minute boil down I'm going to play, I had to take two hours
[1:21:06.840 --> 1:21:10.840]  and condense into ten minutes, I don't even get it all, I mean there's so many juicies
[1:21:10.840 --> 1:21:14.200]  that don't even make it into that, but we're going to have that on the other side.
[1:21:14.200 --> 1:21:18.480]  Let me just clear out this stack of news here before we get into that though.
[1:21:18.480 --> 1:21:24.880]  So again, you've got mainstream media hyping up a porn star as if she's going to be the
[1:21:24.880 --> 1:21:27.040]  hero to bring down Trump.
[1:21:27.040 --> 1:21:32.600]  And so this is the New York Times headline, Stormy Daniels, Trump's unlikely foe is not
[1:21:32.600 --> 1:21:38.200]  someone to be underestimated, wow.
[1:21:38.200 --> 1:21:44.360]  The porn star, don't underestimate her, she's really got it coming for Trump.
[1:21:44.360 --> 1:21:51.160]  Yeah, the porn star is a real threat to the President of the United States, I'm sure.
[1:21:51.160 --> 1:21:56.960]  I'm sure that a porn star really strikes fear into Donald Trump, yes, yes, it's not like
[1:21:56.960 --> 1:22:03.720]  Trump is smart, it's not like he's witty, it's not like he sees things three moves ahead,
[1:22:03.720 --> 1:22:08.480]  probably already did with whatever this deal is.
[1:22:08.480 --> 1:22:12.360]  And I do kind of wonder tongue in cheek if this isn't what he meant by the calm before
[1:22:12.360 --> 1:22:15.920]  the storm, but again, I say that kind of sarcastically.
[1:22:15.920 --> 1:22:26.560]  But again, here's the New York Times saying that a porn star is not to be underestimated.
[1:22:26.560 --> 1:22:28.040]  When was that cover ran guys?
[1:22:28.040 --> 1:22:31.280]  They're showing me a cover of the New York Post, this is from what, the 90s or something
[1:22:31.280 --> 1:22:32.280]  here.
[1:22:32.280 --> 1:22:40.920]  Yeah, yeah, what do you know, a billionaire who works with supermodels is hanging out
[1:22:40.920 --> 1:22:43.160]  and in relationships with supermodels.
[1:22:43.160 --> 1:22:50.760]  Wow, I mean, I had no idea that rich men, athletes, celebrities, actors, what have you,
[1:22:50.760 --> 1:22:55.680]  I didn't know that they hung out with beautiful women and models and playboy models and porn
[1:22:55.680 --> 1:22:56.680]  stars.
[1:22:56.680 --> 1:22:57.680]  I didn't know that was going on.
[1:22:57.680 --> 1:23:02.480]  Wow, I mean, wow, I'm just, oh my gosh, I'm just floored.
[1:23:02.480 --> 1:23:08.520]  I'm just flabbergasted that rich famous men hang out with playboy models.
[1:23:08.520 --> 1:23:10.520]  I mean, I've never heard of such a notion.
[1:23:10.520 --> 1:23:14.760]  I mean, this can't be true.
[1:23:14.760 --> 1:23:18.200]  But it's so funny, see, it shows you how fake they are.
[1:23:18.200 --> 1:23:22.640]  It's so funny that here they are now, and they think they can bring down Trump with
[1:23:22.640 --> 1:23:29.520]  a porn star and then paint Trump as some sort of, I guess, degenerate that has a relationship
[1:23:29.520 --> 1:23:33.120]  or has relationships or sexual relationships with porn stars, whatever it is.
[1:23:33.120 --> 1:23:38.480]  And so they think they can use that degenerate, you know, angle to bring Trump down.
[1:23:38.480 --> 1:23:42.560]  Meanwhile, they promote the biggest degeneracy on the face of the earth.
[1:23:42.560 --> 1:23:46.520]  Where did all this degeneracy originate, Hollywood?
[1:23:46.520 --> 1:23:51.160]  And so then they have all of these TV shows like the Kardashians that are porn stars.
[1:23:51.160 --> 1:23:54.200]  Kim Kardashian gets famous from a porn star shoot.
[1:23:54.200 --> 1:24:00.200]  And they have all of these movies, glamorizing sex, sexualizing children.
[1:24:00.200 --> 1:24:03.920]  So Hollywood literally degenerates society.
[1:24:03.920 --> 1:24:08.800]  The media degenerates society with the sex, drugs, rock and roll and all the propaganda.
[1:24:08.800 --> 1:24:12.320]  So they degenerate society.
[1:24:12.320 --> 1:24:17.940]  They are the ones that prop up all of the sex and violence and then try to make money
[1:24:17.940 --> 1:24:20.000]  off of it in the media.
[1:24:20.000 --> 1:24:27.160]  And then they try to say Trump bad, he degenerate, he sleep with porn star and you look at them
[1:24:27.160 --> 1:24:33.040]  and you're like, you just played for 20 years straight sex and violence on TV.
[1:24:33.040 --> 1:24:38.160]  And then you think after you've desensitized me to all of this, you're going to use it
[1:24:38.160 --> 1:24:40.280]  against me?
[1:24:40.280 --> 1:24:46.160]  You think that you, George Clooney, who's protected by arm security all day long, is
[1:24:46.160 --> 1:24:51.960]  going to get on some high horse on a podium and tell me I need to turn my guns in and
[1:24:51.960 --> 1:24:56.160]  we need gun control and then you're going to be escorted out with arm security?
[1:24:56.160 --> 1:24:57.760]  Wow.
[1:24:57.760 --> 1:25:05.520]  And then you realize there are actually liberals out there brainwashed enough to believe it.
[1:25:05.520 --> 1:25:12.760]  So but let's get into, yeah, so, so, I mean, it's just such a joke.
[1:25:12.760 --> 1:25:13.760]  It won't matter.
[1:25:13.760 --> 1:25:17.080]  I mean, they already interviewed the other Playboy model on CNN on Friday.
[1:25:17.080 --> 1:25:19.040]  You know how many people blinked an eye?
[1:25:19.040 --> 1:25:20.040]  None.
[1:25:20.040 --> 1:25:21.040]  Nobody cared.
[1:25:21.040 --> 1:25:25.480]  Nobody cared, Anderson Cooper, about your porn star interview on CNN.
[1:25:25.480 --> 1:25:27.760]  Nobody watches CNN.
[1:25:27.760 --> 1:25:30.560]  Maybe your Stormy Daniels interview gets some viewers though.
[1:25:30.560 --> 1:25:33.800]  Maybe you'll do some good, you know, some good interviews with Stormy Daniels.
[1:25:33.800 --> 1:25:39.720]  I'm sure that everyone really is looking forward to that, not, again, if they understood anything,
[1:25:39.720 --> 1:25:45.040]  they would be attacking Trump on the omnibus bill, but they can't because it's their bill.
[1:25:45.040 --> 1:25:46.480]  They are the ones that wanted it.
[1:25:46.480 --> 1:25:48.240]  They are the ones that wanted to fund Planned Parenthood.
[1:25:48.240 --> 1:25:52.800]  And let me just say this, I don't want to get too much into this because I'll just go
[1:25:52.800 --> 1:26:01.240]  off on a jag, but the Republicans really did themselves no favors with this bill.
[1:26:01.240 --> 1:26:10.000]  And you're looking at a situation now where Trump's base that would have voted Republican
[1:26:10.000 --> 1:26:13.320]  are now totally turned off of the Republican Party.
[1:26:13.320 --> 1:26:14.680]  And how can you blame him?
[1:26:14.680 --> 1:26:16.520]  They're all Republican in name only.
[1:26:16.520 --> 1:26:18.160]  How is Paul Ryan a conservative?
[1:26:18.160 --> 1:26:20.120]  How is Mitch McConnell a conservative?
[1:26:20.120 --> 1:26:22.520]  What have they conserved?
[1:26:22.520 --> 1:26:24.320]  What have they followed through on?
[1:26:24.320 --> 1:26:26.680]  They didn't follow through when they won the House under Obama.
[1:26:26.680 --> 1:26:29.040]  They didn't follow through when they won the Senate under Obama.
[1:26:29.040 --> 1:26:33.400]  They didn't follow through when we elected Trump and they had the House and they had
[1:26:33.400 --> 1:26:34.400]  the Senate.
[1:26:34.400 --> 1:26:35.400]  You know what they did?
[1:26:35.400 --> 1:26:36.400]  Diddly.
[1:26:36.400 --> 1:26:38.360]  They gave the Democrats the bill they wanted.
[1:26:38.360 --> 1:26:40.440]  They give the Democrats sanctuary cities.
[1:26:40.440 --> 1:26:42.920]  They give the Democrats Planned Parenthood funding.
[1:26:42.920 --> 1:26:48.720]  So the Republicans have really screwed the pooch with this deal.
[1:26:48.720 --> 1:26:52.840]  And then we're teasing if you're a television viewer right now.
[1:26:52.840 --> 1:26:57.680]  This is the woman who blows fart whistles at me and then denies it even though I have
[1:26:57.680 --> 1:27:02.440]  all the footage and then gets caught admitting on camera that she's a protest organizer and
[1:27:02.440 --> 1:27:05.520]  she's telling people not to speak to Infowars.
[1:27:05.520 --> 1:27:06.520]  So that's what you get.
[1:27:06.520 --> 1:27:08.440]  We'll have that on their side.
[1:27:08.440 --> 1:27:12.640]  Facebook runs UK US newspaper ads apologizing for data scandal.
[1:27:12.640 --> 1:27:18.160]  Oh boy, Facebook doing damage control as it looks like they're going to burn one of their
[1:27:18.160 --> 1:27:19.360]  own again.
[1:27:19.360 --> 1:27:20.360]  Mark Zuckerberg.
[1:27:20.360 --> 1:27:23.440]  Folks, we need your support at InfowarsStore.com.
[1:27:23.440 --> 1:27:28.680]  Now we honestly need to hire more people with the amount of reports we're doing.
[1:27:28.680 --> 1:27:30.200]  It's just insanity.
[1:27:30.200 --> 1:27:31.640]  And I'm not complaining, believe me.
[1:27:31.640 --> 1:27:35.000]  But when I go out to these deals, I go out by myself.
[1:27:35.000 --> 1:27:36.200]  I'm my own cameraman.
[1:27:36.200 --> 1:27:37.200]  I'm holding a mic.
[1:27:37.200 --> 1:27:38.200]  I don't even have a free hand.
[1:27:38.200 --> 1:27:40.120]  I edit all of it by myself.
[1:27:40.120 --> 1:27:41.120]  So I'm not complaining.
[1:27:41.120 --> 1:27:42.120]  It's just we want to expand.
[1:27:42.120 --> 1:27:43.120]  We want to do more.
[1:27:43.120 --> 1:27:44.120]  We want to hire more editors.
[1:27:44.120 --> 1:27:45.120]  We want to hire more reporters.
[1:27:45.120 --> 1:27:48.840]  We want to have bigger studios and it's all in the works, but it all relies on your support

[1:28:50.440 --> 1:28:53.120]  to ban guns that don't even exist.
[1:28:53.120 --> 1:28:54.120]  Wow.

[1:31:50.320 --> 1:31:54.040]  and be good to each other and ourselves, we can take our country back.
[1:31:54.040 --> 1:32:03.560]  Hey, did you know that you can now preserve your own food for up to 25 years and still
[1:32:03.560 --> 1:32:06.560]  maintain its nutrition and flavor?
[1:32:06.560 --> 1:32:07.560]  That's right.
[1:32:07.560 --> 1:32:12.240]  It's time to build your own food storage with Harvest Rights Freeze Dryers.
[1:32:12.240 --> 1:32:17.440]  Go to infowarsstore.com to learn more and check out this innovative and smart technology
[1:32:17.440 --> 1:32:19.760]  that's easy to use and let me tell you something.

[1:32:25.440 --> 1:32:26.440]  meals.
[1:32:26.440 --> 1:32:30.880]  Woo, that's what I'm talking about and when compared to traditional methods of preservation
[1:32:30.880 --> 1:32:35.040]  like canning or dehydrating, you know like what you get at the grocery store, there is
[1:32:35.040 --> 1:32:36.760]  no comparison.
[1:32:36.760 --> 1:32:42.640]  Harvest Right Freeze Dryers retain 97% of the food's taste, color and nutritional value
[1:32:42.640 --> 1:32:46.120]  and have a shelf life of up to 25 years.

[1:32:53.680 --> 1:32:54.680]  So what are you waiting for?
[1:32:54.680 --> 1:33:01.600]  Check it out right now at infowarsstore.com.
[1:33:01.600 --> 1:33:08.600]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[1:33:08.600 --> 1:33:25.920]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, you're listening to the Alex Jones Show and now your
[1:33:25.920 --> 1:33:28.600]  host, Owen Troyer.
[1:33:28.600 --> 1:33:35.360]  Well, you can pretty much get liberals to be tricked into sign anything, say anything,
[1:33:35.360 --> 1:33:38.720]  do anything because they're that ignorant.
[1:33:38.720 --> 1:33:43.520]  I've got liberals to sign a petition to remove George Washington off the dollar bill.
[1:33:43.520 --> 1:33:48.160]  I've got liberals to sign or to admit that they like Trump's tax plan by saying it's
[1:33:48.160 --> 1:33:49.160]  Bernie's.
[1:33:49.160 --> 1:33:53.600]  Mark Dice gets liberals to say we need to stop hunting pterodactyls.
[1:33:53.600 --> 1:34:01.080]  Now Rex Jones goes out to the streets to ask liberals about guns that don't even exist.
[1:34:01.080 --> 1:34:05.240]  Hi, I'm Rex Jones from infowars.com, but I'm no longer Rex Jones.
[1:34:05.240 --> 1:34:11.200]  I'm Chad Flindersen from News 7, a liberal news organization which I made up.
[1:34:11.200 --> 1:34:15.880]  I'm here to see what insane gun accessories and gun laws people will actually believe
[1:34:15.880 --> 1:34:16.880]  exist.
[1:34:16.880 --> 1:34:22.960]  Do you think that the semi-automatic nozzle should be banned on most AR-15s?
[1:34:22.960 --> 1:34:27.120]  This is a device which lets the user screw off the barrel of the gun and convert it into
[1:34:27.120 --> 1:34:33.280]  a semi-automatic, oozy like weapon for more damage in close areas.
[1:34:33.280 --> 1:34:34.280]  See that right there?
[1:34:34.280 --> 1:34:36.280]  That, in fact, is the nozzle right there.
[1:34:36.280 --> 1:34:37.280]  Do you think that should be banned?
[1:34:37.280 --> 1:34:38.280]  Yes.
[1:34:38.280 --> 1:34:39.640]  It's good to talk to people that know what they're talking about.
[1:34:39.640 --> 1:34:40.640]  This is awesome.
[1:34:40.640 --> 1:34:42.240]  What are your thoughts on buff stocks?
[1:34:42.240 --> 1:34:44.040]  I think they should be illegal.
[1:34:44.040 --> 1:34:45.560]  Yeah, they're absolutely horrible.
[1:34:45.560 --> 1:34:48.840]  It allows you to turn a semi-automatic weapon into a fully automatic weapon.
[1:34:48.840 --> 1:34:49.840]  I know.
[1:34:49.840 --> 1:34:50.840]  Totally illegal.
[1:34:50.840 --> 1:34:51.840]  It's awful.
[1:34:51.840 --> 1:34:58.280]  It switches through mode of fire, incredibly dangerous, this is one of the things that
[1:34:58.280 --> 1:34:59.280]  the NRA loves.
[1:34:59.280 --> 1:35:02.440]  Here's the thing, I don't want to be on the news, but I will tell you that I think anything
[1:35:02.440 --> 1:35:05.240]  that makes it easier to kill more people in a short amount of time is bad and should
[1:35:05.240 --> 1:35:06.240]  be illegal.
[1:35:06.240 --> 1:35:07.240]  Absolutely.
[1:35:07.240 --> 1:35:08.240]  Thank you so much, ma'am.
[1:35:08.240 --> 1:35:09.240]  Common Sense Gun Reform.
[1:35:09.240 --> 1:35:10.240]  Sorry?
[1:35:10.240 --> 1:35:12.600]  Thoughts on Common Sense Gun Reform?
[1:35:12.600 --> 1:35:13.600]  Any opinions?
[1:35:13.600 --> 1:35:17.080]  Um, band guns.
[1:35:17.080 --> 1:35:20.840]  Mr. and Mrs. America, turn them all in.
[1:35:20.840 --> 1:35:24.120]  That's, I would say a good opinion right there.
[1:35:24.120 --> 1:35:28.480]  Are you aware of the new apparatus the NRA is shipping out as these modified bump stocks
[1:35:28.480 --> 1:35:31.640]  turning any semi-automatic weapon into a fully automatic weapon?
[1:35:31.640 --> 1:35:33.640]  Yeah, I think I've probably heard of that.
[1:35:33.640 --> 1:35:35.640]  I'm definitely against that.
[1:35:35.640 --> 1:35:37.040]  Well it's this apparatus right here.
[1:35:37.040 --> 1:35:38.040]  Do you see it?
[1:35:38.040 --> 1:35:39.040]  Yeah.
[1:35:39.040 --> 1:35:40.040]  Highly dangerous.
[1:35:40.040 --> 1:35:43.960]  In some cases people are even fitting blades into them so they can use it as a hacksaw for
[1:35:43.960 --> 1:35:44.960]  more damage.
[1:35:44.960 --> 1:35:45.960]  You don't have to sell me.
[1:35:45.960 --> 1:35:49.920]  I'm 100% forgotten control.
[1:35:49.920 --> 1:35:50.920]  What would you say?
[1:35:50.920 --> 1:35:51.920]  What do we need now?
[1:35:51.920 --> 1:35:52.920]  What kind of legislation?
[1:35:52.920 --> 1:36:00.160]  Um, I mean we need to ban these types of automatic and, um, you know, the military style weapons.
[1:36:00.160 --> 1:36:01.360]  I'm so sorry about that.
[1:36:01.360 --> 1:36:03.040]  The fully semi-automatic weapons?
[1:36:03.040 --> 1:36:04.040]  Yeah.
[1:36:04.040 --> 1:36:07.480]  Um, I mean there's no reason that a citizen needs something like that.
[1:36:07.480 --> 1:36:08.480]  Absolutely.
[1:36:08.480 --> 1:36:12.840]  You know, did you know that that screws off and becomes an even more deadly, oozy like
[1:36:12.840 --> 1:36:13.840]  weapon?
[1:36:13.840 --> 1:36:14.840]  I mean, yeah.
[1:36:14.840 --> 1:36:19.400]  Um, I mean it's already deadly enough, I think, already.
[1:36:19.400 --> 1:36:25.680]  The thing is, is any American can go and purchase one of those using their several liberties
[1:36:25.680 --> 1:36:26.680]  and that's absolutely horrible.
[1:36:26.680 --> 1:36:27.680]  Thank you.
[1:36:27.680 --> 1:36:28.680]  Thank you.
[1:36:28.680 --> 1:36:29.680]  Working.
[1:36:29.680 --> 1:36:30.680]  Thank you for your opinion.
[1:36:30.680 --> 1:36:31.680]  Yeah.
[1:36:31.680 --> 1:36:32.680]  I'm just working on it.
[1:36:32.680 --> 1:36:33.680]  Thank you so much.
[1:36:33.680 --> 1:36:40.000]  A great example of how the average liberal s**t of you is so stupid and uneducated on
[1:36:40.000 --> 1:36:44.760]  the matters of gun control that they'll just believe anything you feed them.
[1:36:44.760 --> 1:36:51.920]  I mean, the things that I'm making up could not be more fake, a bullet button, a hacksaw
[1:36:51.920 --> 1:36:57.640]  bump stock, come on people, anyone with like half a brain cell should be able to recognize
[1:36:57.640 --> 1:36:58.640]  this stuff.
[1:36:58.640 --> 1:37:01.480]  A lot of people know about the bump stocks, you're well-educated, you know about them,
[1:37:01.480 --> 1:37:06.120]  but not a lot of people know about the screw off nozzle that the newer AR-15s are capable
[1:37:06.120 --> 1:37:07.120]  of.
[1:37:07.120 --> 1:37:10.960]  See, and specialized forms like this one, you're able to actually screw off the top
[1:37:10.960 --> 1:37:14.560]  of this one and it turns into an even more highly lethal oozy like weapon.
[1:37:14.560 --> 1:37:16.520]  What are your thoughts on that, sir?
[1:37:16.520 --> 1:37:21.520]  I'm not entirely, you know, I don't know anything about that too much, so I really
[1:37:21.520 --> 1:37:27.080]  know, but I mean, the idea of it sounds a lot more dangerous.
[1:37:27.080 --> 1:37:32.240]  It's newer technology, the NRA, and actually a couple of senators are working on getting
[1:37:32.240 --> 1:37:34.480]  this technology since the United States.
[1:37:34.480 --> 1:37:37.000]  Highly dangerous, you see the screw off nozzle there.
[1:37:37.000 --> 1:37:41.240]  And I think it's just absolutely wonderful that a citizen like you is open to common
[1:37:41.240 --> 1:37:42.240]  sense gun reform.
[1:37:42.240 --> 1:37:43.240]  Thank you, sir.
[1:37:43.240 --> 1:37:44.240]  No problem.
[1:37:44.240 --> 1:37:47.640]  It would only take a moment of your time.
[1:37:47.640 --> 1:37:48.640]  We'd really appreciate it here.
[1:37:48.640 --> 1:37:51.120]  Would you step back here, please?
[1:37:51.120 --> 1:37:52.120]  Thank you, sir.
[1:37:52.120 --> 1:37:53.760]  What are your thoughts on common sense gun reform and control?
[1:37:53.760 --> 1:37:56.360]  I support common sense gun control reform.
[1:37:56.360 --> 1:37:57.360]  Thank you.
[1:37:57.360 --> 1:37:58.440]  It's common sense.
[1:37:58.440 --> 1:37:59.880]  People don't need weapons of war.
[1:37:59.880 --> 1:38:00.880]  I agree.
[1:38:00.880 --> 1:38:06.760]  We were just in the LBJ presidential library and they had guns just like this.
[1:38:06.760 --> 1:38:10.200]  They said weapons of war in the glass and I was thinking to myself, you can buy these
[1:38:10.200 --> 1:38:11.640]  at Swartz Authority.
[1:38:11.640 --> 1:38:13.720]  That is a great observation.
[1:38:13.720 --> 1:38:18.360]  Are you aware of the bullet button allows people to rapidly change firing modes and
[1:38:18.360 --> 1:38:23.760]  are you aware the bump stock turns any weapon into a fully automatic weapon ready to kill
[1:38:23.760 --> 1:38:24.760]  hundreds of people?
[1:38:24.760 --> 1:38:26.960]  I am and I don't understand why that's legal.
[1:38:26.960 --> 1:38:27.960]  Thanks.
[1:38:27.960 --> 1:38:31.720]  I mean, what candidates are you supporting that support things like this?
[1:38:31.720 --> 1:38:36.520]  Well, it seems like a standard platform on the Democratic Party side.
[1:38:36.520 --> 1:38:37.520]  That's what I like.
[1:38:37.520 --> 1:38:42.480]  I feel as if the Republican ideals of the Second Amendment are really outdated now that we have
[1:38:42.480 --> 1:38:43.920]  weapons like this.
[1:38:43.920 --> 1:38:45.560]  It was meant for muskets in reality.
[1:38:45.560 --> 1:38:46.560]  I know.
[1:38:46.560 --> 1:38:51.520]  When you look at the history, it was meant for weapons that could fire one shot a minute.
[1:38:51.520 --> 1:38:52.960]  Only the government should have weapons like this.
[1:38:52.960 --> 1:38:53.960]  Don't you agree?
[1:38:53.960 --> 1:38:54.960]  I agree.
[1:38:54.960 --> 1:38:55.960]  Absolutely.
[1:38:55.960 --> 1:38:56.960]  Thanks.
[1:38:56.960 --> 1:38:58.440]  And just in closing, I know we've taken up so much of your time.
[1:38:58.440 --> 1:38:59.440]  I appreciate it.
[1:38:59.440 --> 1:39:00.680]  You are a thinker and an intellectual.
[1:39:00.680 --> 1:39:02.760]  I really appreciate you commenting on this.
[1:39:02.760 --> 1:39:06.080]  What is your opinion on the 1,000 yard site that is totally legal and people can snipe
[1:39:06.080 --> 1:39:07.760]  whoever they want?
[1:39:07.760 --> 1:39:10.920]  Well, I think it's necessary for hunting.
[1:39:10.920 --> 1:39:14.040]  Oh, yeah, for hunting, but we have like metal and wood.
[1:39:14.040 --> 1:39:15.040]  It's a good rule of thumb.
[1:39:15.040 --> 1:39:16.800]  You have rifles that are meant for hunting.
[1:39:16.800 --> 1:39:18.160]  This is meant to kill people.
[1:39:18.160 --> 1:39:19.160]  Yeah.
[1:39:19.160 --> 1:39:21.080]  Why it's legal to attach to a weapon that should be banned?
[1:39:21.080 --> 1:39:22.080]  I don't understand.
[1:39:22.080 --> 1:39:24.600]  The 2, 2, 3, it's a heavy round.
[1:39:24.600 --> 1:39:27.160]  It's meant to take, it's meant to take out armor piercing plates.
[1:39:27.160 --> 1:39:28.160]  It's what the military uses.
[1:39:28.160 --> 1:39:33.840]  It's just a slightly less powerful version of the M16, which the military uses.
[1:39:33.840 --> 1:39:34.840]  So you agree with me.
[1:39:34.840 --> 1:39:36.880]  Weapons like this should be banned, right?
[1:39:36.880 --> 1:39:37.880]  I do agree.
[1:39:37.880 --> 1:39:43.760]  I don't think weapons of war should be able to be bought by anyone who's over 18 or 21.
[1:39:43.760 --> 1:39:50.600]  Anyone who has a weapon, which is capable to add blades on, telescopic sniping people,
[1:39:50.600 --> 1:39:55.240]  having weapons like this, which have a unscrupable nozzle where you can pull it out and it functions
[1:39:55.240 --> 1:39:57.080]  just identically to an Uzi.
[1:39:57.080 --> 1:40:01.200]  That's incredibly legal, but it's legal thanks to our NRA and the Second Amendment.
[1:40:01.200 --> 1:40:02.600]  That should be abolished, in my opinion.
[1:40:02.600 --> 1:40:03.600]  Yeah, I think so.
[1:40:03.600 --> 1:40:07.360]  I think the right to protect yourself, you don't need a weapon like this to protect
[1:40:07.360 --> 1:40:09.920]  yourself at home and you don't need a weapon like this to be a good hunter.
[1:40:09.920 --> 1:40:12.480]  Oh, just get a can of pepper spray.
[1:40:12.480 --> 1:40:13.640]  I mean, come on.
[1:40:13.640 --> 1:40:18.640]  You don't need AK-17s and AR-15s and 12s.
[1:40:18.640 --> 1:40:20.760]  You don't need weapons like that, do you?
[1:40:20.760 --> 1:40:21.920]  I don't think so.
[1:40:21.920 --> 1:40:22.920]  AR-17s.
[1:40:22.920 --> 1:40:23.920]  Thank you, sir.
[1:40:23.920 --> 1:40:25.080]  Can I shake your hand really quick?
[1:40:25.080 --> 1:40:27.400]  I just, man, I love meeting people like you.
[1:40:27.400 --> 1:40:28.920]  People that know what they're talking about.
[1:40:28.920 --> 1:40:29.920]  Vote.
[1:40:29.920 --> 1:40:30.920]  Get out there and vote.
[1:40:30.920 --> 1:40:31.920]  I do vote, and thanks for your work as well.
[1:40:31.920 --> 1:40:32.920]  Thank you, sir.
[1:40:32.920 --> 1:40:33.920]  Really appreciate it.
[1:40:33.920 --> 1:40:37.680]  Thank you, Kevin, the complete bullcrap agency, where we sell fake gun control laws.
[1:40:37.680 --> 1:40:42.160]  And just really brainwash people into thinking about guns in a vastly different way.
[1:40:42.160 --> 1:40:44.080]  No one needs a bump stock, right?
[1:40:44.080 --> 1:40:45.080]  They don't.
[1:40:45.080 --> 1:40:49.920]  I mean, bump stocks are able to turn any gun into a fully automatic weapon.
[1:40:49.920 --> 1:40:54.800]  And in some cases, like the Las Vegas shooter, people are attaching blades to them.
[1:40:54.800 --> 1:40:55.800]  That's not okay, right?
[1:40:55.800 --> 1:40:57.800]  It is not okay.
[1:40:57.800 --> 1:41:03.880]  You know, I'm okay for people that want to have guns for protection and things like that.
[1:41:03.880 --> 1:41:08.000]  But why do you need that kind of gun?
[1:41:08.000 --> 1:41:09.080]  Nobody needs that kind of gun.
[1:41:09.080 --> 1:41:10.680]  You don't need this kind of weaponry.
[1:41:10.680 --> 1:41:12.400]  I mean, it's absurd.
[1:41:12.400 --> 1:41:15.640]  I mean, to protect yourself, get a shotgun.
[1:41:15.640 --> 1:41:18.280]  You don't need a fully semi-automatic weapon.
[1:41:18.280 --> 1:41:20.080]  Get some pepper spray.
[1:41:20.080 --> 1:41:21.720]  I mean, amen, people.
[1:41:21.720 --> 1:41:22.720]  Stun gun.
[1:41:22.720 --> 1:41:23.720]  Stun gun.
[1:41:23.720 --> 1:41:24.720]  Buy a shotgun.
[1:41:24.720 --> 1:41:25.720]  Buy a shotgun.
[1:41:25.720 --> 1:41:26.720]  Here.
[1:41:26.720 --> 1:41:27.720]  Thank you.
[1:41:27.720 --> 1:41:28.720]  Non-lethals.
[1:41:28.720 --> 1:41:30.840]  I mean, we have such a wide range.
[1:41:30.840 --> 1:41:32.200]  It's not muskets anymore.
[1:41:32.200 --> 1:41:35.680]  People buy weapons like this, trying to protect themselves and their families.
[1:41:35.680 --> 1:41:36.960]  That's ridiculous.
[1:41:36.960 --> 1:41:38.760]  Single shot or no shots at all.
[1:41:38.760 --> 1:41:39.760]  That's what I say.
[1:41:39.760 --> 1:41:42.600]  What are your thoughts on this, ma'am?
[1:41:42.600 --> 1:41:49.400]  I believe in personal protection, but there's no reason for anything on an automatic weapon.
[1:41:49.400 --> 1:41:50.880]  What are your thoughts about the bullet button?
[1:41:50.880 --> 1:41:56.920]  Once you switch through modes of fire, it should be highly legal, right?
[1:41:56.920 --> 1:42:01.000]  The modes of fire should be highly illegal, you say?
[1:42:01.000 --> 1:42:02.480]  The bullet button, it lets you switch.
[1:42:02.480 --> 1:42:04.080]  I don't even know about a bullet button.
[1:42:04.080 --> 1:42:07.080]  Well, that's what the NRA has been trying to cover up by paying up the politicians.
[1:42:07.080 --> 1:42:08.080]  It's the bullet button.
[1:42:08.080 --> 1:42:09.840]  Oh, I would be against it.
[1:42:09.840 --> 1:42:12.760]  In fact, I think we should regulate bullets more than guns.
[1:42:12.760 --> 1:42:14.680]  Oh, actually, I mean, you take a hollow point bullet.
[1:42:14.680 --> 1:42:18.320]  I mean, those things can pierce through cars when it's on fully automatic.
[1:42:18.320 --> 1:42:22.520]  When a hollow point bullet's on fully automatic, it can go through a person's head.
[1:42:22.520 --> 1:42:24.200]  I'm sorry for the gross imagery.
[1:42:24.200 --> 1:42:25.200]  Like a watermelon.
[1:42:25.200 --> 1:42:26.200]  It should be highly legal, right?
[1:42:26.200 --> 1:42:27.200]  What are your thoughts on that?
[1:42:27.200 --> 1:42:28.720]  Yeah, I agree with that.
[1:42:28.720 --> 1:42:30.840]  There's no reason for it.
[1:42:30.840 --> 1:42:35.440]  All we need is, you know, like Don was saying, personal protection.
[1:42:35.440 --> 1:42:40.880]  I mean, anyone can go into an academy now and purchase a weapon of war.
[1:42:40.880 --> 1:42:41.880]  This should be illegal.
[1:42:41.880 --> 1:42:43.800]  I'm sick of this, and I'm sick of this crap.
[1:42:43.800 --> 1:42:45.600]  We need common sense gun reform now.
[1:42:45.600 --> 1:42:49.480]  Wow, who is this young, energetic newsman?
[1:42:49.480 --> 1:42:50.480]  He is right.
[1:42:50.480 --> 1:42:52.400]  We need to do something about the bullet button.
[1:42:52.400 --> 1:42:54.200]  Wow, so there you go, folks.
[1:42:54.200 --> 1:42:57.680]  Proof, liberals will literally fall for anything.

[1:44:32.120 --> 1:44:40.480]  these are the very cutting-edge, top-of-the-line probiotics and digestive enzymes at an extremely

[1:44:58.160 --> 1:45:02.680]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide, also enjoying
[1:45:02.680 --> 1:45:07.320]  what I have found to be the best tasting 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[1:45:07.320 --> 1:45:12.040]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern
[1:45:12.040 --> 1:45:15.720]  Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[1:45:15.720 --> 1:45:21.040]  We have now managed to secure these sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[1:45:21.040 --> 1:45:27.440]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at InfoWarsLife.com.
[1:45:27.440 --> 1:45:32.560]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn
[1:45:32.560 --> 1:45:34.680]  that so many other coffees give me personally.
[1:45:34.680 --> 1:45:39.680]  As down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections directly
[1:45:39.680 --> 1:45:41.520]  to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[1:45:41.520 --> 1:45:46.400]  Dropped by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[1:45:46.400 --> 1:45:50.320]  Available in original, or with our immune support infusion blend, you will be supporting
[1:45:50.320 --> 1:45:51.320]  a free press.
[1:45:51.320 --> 1:45:58.240]  All the while enjoying a truly great tasting cup of my favorite coffee, available at InfoWarsLife.com.
[1:45:58.240 --> 1:46:01.040]  It's been sold out for months, and now it's back.
[1:46:01.040 --> 1:46:07.360]  It's MycoZX Plus, lower price, more ingredients, because we scaled up, signed to your contract
[1:46:07.360 --> 1:46:11.320]  with an even bigger organic manufacturer and producer.
[1:46:11.320 --> 1:46:12.320]  Scalability.
[1:46:12.320 --> 1:46:18.240]  But now, we're able to go at 50% off to $27 instead of $39, 50% off, because there's
[1:46:18.240 --> 1:46:21.280]  a lot of product and a lot of ingredient, MycoZX.
[1:46:21.280 --> 1:46:22.760]  Now, it's the other side of the equation.
[1:46:22.760 --> 1:46:26.880]  Everybody thinks about probiotics, and how great they are for your gut, because of toxins
[1:46:26.880 --> 1:46:28.840]  in the environment, pesticides, herbicides.
[1:46:28.840 --> 1:46:32.960]  But more importantly than bad bacteria, the probiotics help displace.
[1:46:32.960 --> 1:46:35.920]  Yeast mold creates slime walls.
[1:46:35.920 --> 1:46:40.480]  And once the candida and the yeast and the mold and all that get in there, it causes
[1:46:40.480 --> 1:46:41.480]  all sorts of psoriasis.
[1:46:41.480 --> 1:46:46.160]  Well, this has got a bunch of concentrated herbs in it, and compounds known to destroy
[1:46:46.160 --> 1:46:48.160]  that slime wall.
[1:46:48.160 --> 1:46:50.320]  Don't wait to start detoxifying your body until it's too late.
[1:46:50.320 --> 1:47:01.560]  Pick up a bottle of the new and improved MycoZX Plus now from the InfoWars store.
[1:47:01.560 --> 1:47:06.360]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[1:47:06.360 --> 1:47:17.480]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, final segment of the Alex Jones Show here on a Sunday, Owen
[1:47:17.480 --> 1:47:19.320]  Shroyer filling in.
[1:47:19.320 --> 1:47:22.120]  Now, let's go to this boil down report.
[1:47:22.120 --> 1:47:28.520]  I was live from the March for Our Lives in Austin, Texas yesterday for two hours.
[1:47:28.520 --> 1:47:31.520]  All of the footage can be found on the Alex Jones channel of YouTube, and it really is
[1:47:31.520 --> 1:47:32.520]  worth it.
[1:47:32.520 --> 1:47:35.360]  I'm going to try to put out a couple of boil downs, but the whole thing is just insane.
[1:47:35.360 --> 1:47:42.160]  So let's go to a brief compilation of what I experienced yesterday at the March for Our
[1:47:42.160 --> 1:47:43.680]  Lives in Austin, Texas.
[1:47:43.680 --> 1:47:46.840]  If I sat down here, they'd probably all get triggered.
[1:47:46.840 --> 1:47:47.840]  Let's see what happens.
[1:47:47.840 --> 1:47:56.200]  I'm going to sit down.
[1:47:56.200 --> 1:47:57.200]  I call that or what?
[1:47:57.200 --> 1:47:58.200]  Did I call that or what?
[1:47:58.200 --> 1:47:59.200]  What's up, man?
[1:47:59.200 --> 1:48:01.600]  Yeah, it didn't take long, guys.
[1:48:01.600 --> 1:48:02.600]  Did it?
[1:48:02.600 --> 1:48:03.600]  Didn't take long.
[1:48:03.600 --> 1:48:04.600]  Oh, okay.
[1:48:04.600 --> 1:48:05.600]  Sorry about that.
[1:48:05.600 --> 1:48:06.600]  Yep.
[1:48:06.600 --> 1:48:07.600]  I'll move.
[1:48:07.600 --> 1:48:08.600]  I'll get out of the seats.
[1:48:08.600 --> 1:48:09.600]  Yeah, no problem.
[1:48:09.600 --> 1:48:10.600]  Nobody's sitting in the seats.
[1:48:10.600 --> 1:48:11.600]  Here, pause right there.
[1:48:11.600 --> 1:48:13.320]  Just so that because most of our audience is radio.
[1:48:13.320 --> 1:48:14.400]  Nobody is at the March yet.
[1:48:14.400 --> 1:48:16.080]  I'm there before anybody gets there.
[1:48:16.080 --> 1:48:21.080]  There's literally like a hundred seats wide open and I just sit down in one of the seats
[1:48:21.080 --> 1:48:26.680]  and sure enough, here comes the team of brown shirt Nazis to come over and say, sir, you
[1:48:26.680 --> 1:48:27.680]  need to move.
[1:48:27.680 --> 1:48:28.680]  You need to get up.
[1:48:28.680 --> 1:48:29.680]  You need to move.
[1:48:29.680 --> 1:48:30.680]  Just play through.
[1:48:30.680 --> 1:48:31.680]  Just go.
[1:48:31.680 --> 1:48:32.680]  Yeah, here you go.
[1:48:32.680 --> 1:48:33.680]  Yeah, you got to move.
[1:48:33.680 --> 1:48:34.680]  You got to move.
[1:48:34.680 --> 1:48:35.680]  Nobody's in the chairs.
[1:48:35.680 --> 1:48:36.680]  Wide open.
[1:48:36.680 --> 1:48:37.680]  Okay.
[1:48:37.680 --> 1:48:38.680]  Sorry about that.
[1:48:38.680 --> 1:48:39.680]  Yep.
[1:48:39.680 --> 1:48:40.680]  I'll move.
[1:48:40.680 --> 1:48:41.680]  I'll get out of the seats.
[1:48:41.680 --> 1:48:42.680]  Yeah, I was taking a seat from someone, obviously.
[1:48:42.680 --> 1:48:43.680]  I call that or what?
[1:48:43.680 --> 1:48:44.680]  Just part of the hate we get.
[1:48:44.680 --> 1:48:45.680]  Oh, look at this.
[1:48:45.680 --> 1:48:47.680]  Oh, this is just beautiful.
[1:48:47.680 --> 1:48:48.680]  Yes.
[1:48:48.680 --> 1:48:49.680]  Hello.
[1:48:49.680 --> 1:48:50.680]  Yeah.
[1:48:50.680 --> 1:48:51.680]  I can't over here.
[1:48:51.680 --> 1:48:52.680]  Well, no, no, I'm not with press.
[1:48:52.680 --> 1:48:54.680]  I'm just a I'm just a First Amendment free citizen out here.
[1:48:54.680 --> 1:48:55.680]  That's all.
[1:48:55.680 --> 1:48:56.680]  Yeah.
[1:48:56.680 --> 1:48:57.680]  Yeah.
[1:48:57.680 --> 1:48:58.680]  Thanks, guys.
[1:48:58.680 --> 1:48:59.680]  Yeah, then they thought they could intimidate me.
[1:48:59.680 --> 1:49:04.680]  Now they're telling people they can't talk to me.
[1:49:04.680 --> 1:49:07.680]  That seems kind of cultist, don't you think, to stop someone from talking?
[1:49:07.680 --> 1:49:08.680]  I'm right next to him.
[1:49:08.680 --> 1:49:09.680]  No one's going to get aggressive.
[1:49:09.680 --> 1:49:10.680]  Thank you.
[1:49:10.680 --> 1:49:11.680]  All right.
[1:49:11.680 --> 1:49:14.680]  Hey, what do you think about Hillary rigging the election from Bernie?
[1:49:14.680 --> 1:49:19.680]  I mean, I already took a picture of you guys.
[1:49:19.680 --> 1:49:23.680]  How's Alex Jones doing right now, by the way?
[1:49:23.680 --> 1:49:24.680]  Really?
[1:49:24.680 --> 1:49:25.680]  We've got the power.
[1:49:25.680 --> 1:49:26.680]  Are the frogs gay?
[1:49:26.680 --> 1:49:27.680]  Yeah, have you heard of atrazine?
[1:49:27.680 --> 1:49:28.680]  Atrazine?
[1:49:28.680 --> 1:49:30.680]  Is that what turned the frogs gay?
[1:49:30.680 --> 1:49:33.680]  Yeah, there's multiple scientific studies, including one out of California, Berkeley.
[1:49:33.680 --> 1:49:34.680]  Man, that's weird.
[1:49:34.680 --> 1:49:35.680]  It must have turned me.
[1:49:35.680 --> 1:49:36.680]  Now pause it right there.
[1:49:36.680 --> 1:49:44.680]  Now, it's funny because she is also in the video we played in the last segment.
[1:49:44.680 --> 1:49:47.680]  Yeah, I rewind it a little bit more so you can hear her final statement here.
[1:49:47.680 --> 1:49:53.680]  But I mean, there's this weird new thing where they just come up to me and they take a picture.
[1:49:53.680 --> 1:49:55.680]  Like, I'm some sort of ghost or something.
[1:49:55.680 --> 1:49:59.680]  Like, taking a picture of me is intimidating or something, or they're capturing a ghost
[1:49:59.680 --> 1:50:00.680]  or Bigfoot or something.
[1:50:00.680 --> 1:50:01.680]  I'm going to keep interrupting.
[1:50:01.680 --> 1:50:02.680]  Just let it play.
[1:50:02.680 --> 1:50:06.680]  Man, that's weird.
[1:50:06.680 --> 1:50:10.680]  It must have turned me gay, too.
[1:50:10.680 --> 1:50:14.680]  Man, did you hear about the Maryland shooting?
[1:50:14.680 --> 1:50:17.680]  Man, I can't handle it.
[1:50:17.680 --> 1:50:18.680]  All right, all right.
[1:50:18.680 --> 1:50:19.680]  Mental patient.
[1:50:19.680 --> 1:50:20.680]  Oh, you're this one.
[1:50:20.680 --> 1:50:21.680]  Hey, sir, that's a nice shirt.
[1:50:21.680 --> 1:50:23.680]  What don't you like about Trump?
[1:50:23.680 --> 1:50:25.680]  Where do I start?
[1:50:25.680 --> 1:50:27.680]  Anywhere you'd like.
[1:50:27.680 --> 1:50:32.680]  No, I asked about your shirt.
[1:50:32.680 --> 1:50:34.680]  Talk about brainwash zombie.
[1:50:34.680 --> 1:50:36.680]  Oh, you can't tell me why you don't like Trump, right?
[1:50:36.680 --> 1:50:37.680]  Just like all the others.
[1:50:37.680 --> 1:50:39.680]  You don't have the brain capacity.
[1:50:39.680 --> 1:50:41.680]  I have the brain capacity to tell you why I like Trump.
[1:50:41.680 --> 1:50:44.680]  I don't have the brain capacity to connect more than two dots.
[1:50:44.680 --> 1:50:46.680]  Okay, so let me tell you why I like Trump.
[1:50:46.680 --> 1:50:47.680]  He wants a strong border.
[1:50:47.680 --> 1:50:48.680]  He's fixing the economy.
[1:50:48.680 --> 1:50:49.680]  Why don't you like Trump?
[1:50:49.680 --> 1:50:51.680]  You were beaten when you were a kid.
[1:50:51.680 --> 1:50:53.680]  And here's the youth leading the march.
[1:50:53.680 --> 1:50:55.680]  The Hitler-Nazi Bergerade, the brown shirt.
[1:50:55.680 --> 1:50:58.680]  Now, this is where it gets insane, and I'm going to put out this full video
[1:50:58.680 --> 1:50:59.680]  probably tomorrow.
[1:50:59.680 --> 1:51:02.680]  This 10-minute clip is the most insane thing you've ever seen.
[1:51:02.680 --> 1:51:03.680]  This is literally what Hitler did.
[1:51:03.680 --> 1:51:11.680]  You are witnessing a brown shirt Nazi propaganda march in 2018, right here, right now.
[1:51:11.680 --> 1:51:14.680]  And then in their next march, they'll say Trump is Hitler
[1:51:14.680 --> 1:51:19.680]  while they are literally replacing the Nazi brown shirts in history right now.
[1:51:19.680 --> 1:51:22.680]  And I'm about to cut this clip a little short for this compilation,
[1:51:22.680 --> 1:51:26.680]  but for 10 minutes, they surrounded me and chanted at me
[1:51:26.680 --> 1:51:29.680]  just because I was there, because I represented their enemy.
[1:51:29.680 --> 1:51:30.680]  I didn't do anything.
[1:51:30.680 --> 1:51:32.680]  It's just I had an NRA hat on and an info-war shirt.
[1:51:32.680 --> 1:51:35.680]  So then they project all of their hatred onto me
[1:51:35.680 --> 1:51:37.680]  because I represent what they think is their enemy,
[1:51:37.680 --> 1:51:39.680]  even though I'm not their enemy.
[1:51:39.680 --> 1:51:41.680]  They always got to block the sign.
[1:51:41.680 --> 1:51:42.680]  Look at this. They always block it.
[1:51:42.680 --> 1:51:43.680]  Look at this.
[1:51:43.680 --> 1:51:45.680]  See? Look at this.
[1:51:45.680 --> 1:51:47.680]  Hey, why are you anti-free speech?
[1:51:47.680 --> 1:51:48.680]  I'm not anti-free speech.
[1:51:48.680 --> 1:51:50.680]  In fact, I'm very much for free speech.
[1:51:50.680 --> 1:51:51.680]  So why are you blocking my camera?
[1:51:51.680 --> 1:51:54.680]  Because you are anti-free speech.
[1:51:54.680 --> 1:51:56.680]  No, I'm not anti-free speech.
[1:51:56.680 --> 1:52:00.680]  What I'm against is you all and you're spreading of misinformation.
[1:52:00.680 --> 1:52:02.680]  Me calm down? How have I not been calm?
[1:52:02.680 --> 1:52:04.680]  You were just screaming at the top of your lungs, dude.
[1:52:04.680 --> 1:52:05.680]  Maybe you should calm down.
[1:52:05.680 --> 1:52:08.680]  Hey, do you know what the Nazi brown shirts were?
[1:52:08.680 --> 1:52:10.680]  I'm not sure if this guy works for Russia.
[1:52:10.680 --> 1:52:11.680]  Me? No, no, no.
[1:52:11.680 --> 1:52:12.680]  The Nazi brown shirts.
[1:52:12.680 --> 1:52:14.680]  If you're going to be a cop, you're going to get slayed.
[1:52:14.680 --> 1:52:15.680]  All right? I mean, you know.
[1:52:15.680 --> 1:52:18.680]  Do you know the Nazi brown shirts marched to turn the guns into?
[1:52:18.680 --> 1:52:19.680]  Did you know that?
[1:52:19.680 --> 1:52:20.680]  Can you not do this?
[1:52:20.680 --> 1:52:21.680]  Can you not?
[1:52:21.680 --> 1:52:22.680]  Well, I have a free speech, right?
[1:52:22.680 --> 1:52:23.680]  Do I have the right to free speech?
[1:52:23.680 --> 1:52:25.680]  I think we should engage, actually.
[1:52:25.680 --> 1:52:27.680]  Is your free speech more important?
[1:52:27.680 --> 1:52:30.680]  No, I think free speech is the most important thing,
[1:52:30.680 --> 1:52:32.680]  and that's how we protect lives.
[1:52:32.680 --> 1:52:33.680]  Fake attention.
[1:52:33.680 --> 1:52:35.680]  Y'all are giving me all the attention.
[1:52:35.680 --> 1:52:37.680]  Well, that's sad that he's being brainwashed
[1:52:37.680 --> 1:52:39.680]  to believing this about guns.
[1:52:39.680 --> 1:52:41.680]  Dude, y'all came up and talked to me.
[1:52:41.680 --> 1:52:43.680]  Tell me why you think gun control is the answer.
[1:52:43.680 --> 1:52:44.680]  It's a conversation.
[1:52:44.680 --> 1:52:47.680]  That's not what we're here to talk about.
[1:52:47.680 --> 1:52:48.680]  So what are we here to talk about?
[1:52:48.680 --> 1:52:50.680]  These kids and what they're protesting against,
[1:52:50.680 --> 1:52:52.680]  and we're here to support them.
[1:52:52.680 --> 1:52:53.680]  What are they protesting?
[1:52:53.680 --> 1:52:55.680]  We should talk to one of them.
[1:52:55.680 --> 1:52:57.680]  All right, what are you protesting today?
[1:52:57.680 --> 1:52:59.680]  You have to be 200 feet away from this.
[1:52:59.680 --> 1:53:01.680]  What are you guys protesting today?
[1:53:01.680 --> 1:53:02.680]  You have to be 200 feet away.
[1:53:02.680 --> 1:53:03.680]  Can you just answer my question?
[1:53:03.680 --> 1:53:05.680]  What are you protesting?
[1:53:05.680 --> 1:53:07.680]  Can't answer.
[1:53:07.680 --> 1:53:09.680]  And then the organizer comes over and says,
[1:53:09.680 --> 1:53:10.680]  don't talk to him for a while.
[1:53:10.680 --> 1:53:11.680]  Nobody can tell me what they're marching for.
[1:53:11.680 --> 1:53:12.680]  What are they marching for?
[1:53:12.680 --> 1:53:13.680]  And this is where it gets insane.
[1:53:13.680 --> 1:53:14.680]  This is where it gets insane.
[1:53:14.680 --> 1:53:16.680]  Enough is enough.
[1:53:16.680 --> 1:53:19.680]  So I just defeated all of them intellectually
[1:53:19.680 --> 1:53:22.680]  and made them all look like total patsies.
[1:53:22.680 --> 1:53:23.680]  And so what is their response?
[1:53:23.680 --> 1:53:26.680]  To start chanting at me and surround me in a circle
[1:53:26.680 --> 1:53:28.680]  after they can't even tell me why they're there.
[1:53:28.680 --> 1:53:29.680]  Now, this is a short clip.
[1:53:29.680 --> 1:53:31.680]  They did this for 10 minutes, folks.
[1:53:31.680 --> 1:53:32.680]  Watch the whole video.
[1:53:32.680 --> 1:53:35.680]  They all surround me and chant at me
[1:53:35.680 --> 1:53:37.680]  as if I'm the enemy.
[1:53:37.680 --> 1:53:39.680]  They couldn't even answer the simple question,
[1:53:39.680 --> 1:53:41.680]  why are you protesting?
[1:53:41.680 --> 1:53:43.680]  Why are you marching?
[1:53:43.680 --> 1:53:44.680]  Of course, they're really marching
[1:53:44.680 --> 1:53:46.680]  because they can't accept the results of the election.
[1:53:46.680 --> 1:53:48.680]  And they just use a bunch of different arguments
[1:53:48.680 --> 1:53:50.680]  to complain about the election.
[1:53:57.680 --> 1:53:58.680]  Did we lose audio here, guys?
[1:53:58.680 --> 1:53:59.680]  Oh, there we go.
[1:53:59.680 --> 1:54:01.680]  The youth gets brainwashed like this.
[1:54:01.680 --> 1:54:03.680]  That happened to me, too.
[1:54:03.680 --> 1:54:05.680]  I used to feel the same way as these kids
[1:54:05.680 --> 1:54:07.680]  and I researched history and I found out
[1:54:07.680 --> 1:54:09.680]  that gun control is not the answer.
[1:54:09.680 --> 1:54:11.680]  Oh, my God!
[1:54:11.680 --> 1:54:14.680]  Yeah, see, they laugh because they don't get taught history
[1:54:14.680 --> 1:54:16.680]  and they think it's funny.
[1:54:16.680 --> 1:54:18.680]  What's wrong with info wars?
[1:54:18.680 --> 1:54:20.680]  Yeah, walk away.
[1:54:20.680 --> 1:54:21.680]  Hey, what's wrong with info wars?
[1:54:21.680 --> 1:54:22.680]  Yeah, take a picture.
[1:54:22.680 --> 1:54:23.680]  Yeah, they all want to take a picture of me.
[1:54:23.680 --> 1:54:24.680]  It's really this weird thing.
[1:54:24.680 --> 1:54:26.680]  I'm like a bigfoot, right?
[1:54:26.680 --> 1:54:27.680]  I'm like bigfoot.
[1:54:27.680 --> 1:54:30.680]  I'm so rare.
[1:54:30.680 --> 1:54:32.680]  I'm Bigfoot's ancestor.
[1:54:32.680 --> 1:54:33.680]  Don't you want to interview me?
[1:54:33.680 --> 1:54:35.680]  I'll tell you, the biggest thing is
[1:54:35.680 --> 1:54:37.680]  there's a sign over here where they're glorifying the shooter.
[1:54:37.680 --> 1:54:40.680]  Now, these are conservatives, well-spoken, good people.
[1:54:40.680 --> 1:54:42.680]  I'm sorry, I'm talking.
[1:54:42.680 --> 1:54:44.680]  I'm a volunteer with the organizers here.
[1:54:44.680 --> 1:54:46.680]  They were asking people, as a condition,
[1:54:46.680 --> 1:54:49.680]  if people agreed to come, not to speak to counter protesters.
[1:54:49.680 --> 1:54:52.680]  And just to let you know, this is info wars.
[1:54:52.680 --> 1:54:54.680]  You're the lady that blows fart noises at me.
[1:54:54.680 --> 1:54:56.680]  No, I don't believe I am.
[1:54:56.680 --> 1:54:57.680]  This is her!
[1:54:57.680 --> 1:54:59.680]  Yeah, she denies it, even though we have the video.
[1:54:59.680 --> 1:55:01.680]  Absolutely, we totally recognize that.
[1:55:01.680 --> 1:55:03.680]  The organizers have asked that you not.
[1:55:03.680 --> 1:55:06.680]  If you want to differ with them, please go ahead.
[1:55:06.680 --> 1:55:09.680]  Wow, so they don't like the First Amendment either, do they?
[1:55:09.680 --> 1:55:10.680]  Absolutely not.
[1:55:10.680 --> 1:55:12.680]  Yeah, so you guys aren't allowed to speak,
[1:55:12.680 --> 1:55:13.680]  and you're not allowed to have a gun,
[1:55:13.680 --> 1:55:15.680]  so they just want you to be slaves, it sounds like.
[1:55:15.680 --> 1:55:16.680]  Right, yeah.
[1:55:16.680 --> 1:55:19.680]  See, if I even ask these girls a question, I'd be considered a bad person.
[1:55:19.680 --> 1:55:21.680]  The fart whistle lady comes back here.
[1:55:21.680 --> 1:55:24.680]  Even though I want to change their mind on America and gun violence.
[1:55:24.680 --> 1:55:27.680]  Hey, you didn't bring your fart whistle out here today, what's up?
[1:55:27.680 --> 1:55:29.680]  I'm not going to talk to you, leave me alone.
[1:55:29.680 --> 1:55:31.680]  Come on, we missed the fart whistle.
[1:55:31.680 --> 1:55:33.680]  We want the whistle.
[1:55:33.680 --> 1:55:35.680]  Come on, we want the whistle.
[1:55:35.680 --> 1:55:37.680]  Show the b-roll if I want the whistle.
[1:55:37.680 --> 1:55:39.680]  Can we get the b-roll?
[1:55:39.680 --> 1:55:41.680]  Come on, come on, come on, come on.
[1:55:41.680 --> 1:55:43.680]  We just want the fart whistle.
[1:55:43.680 --> 1:55:45.680]  There she is, there she is with the fart whistle.
[1:55:45.680 --> 1:55:48.680]  She denies she does it, and then we have the video.
[1:55:48.680 --> 1:55:50.680]  I mean, literally, we have the video,
[1:55:50.680 --> 1:55:52.680]  multiple videos of her blowing fart whistles,
[1:55:52.680 --> 1:55:54.680]  and she says, nope, that's not me.
[1:55:54.680 --> 1:55:57.680]  These people are cold-hearted liars, folks.
[1:55:57.680 --> 1:55:59.680]  They'll lie right to your face.
[1:55:59.680 --> 1:56:01.680]  Oh, she's back, she's back.
[1:56:01.680 --> 1:56:02.680]  Don't talk to info wars.
[1:56:02.680 --> 1:56:05.680]  Hey, why are you stopping my right to free speech?
[1:56:05.680 --> 1:56:06.680]  Go away.
[1:56:06.680 --> 1:56:09.680]  And she's out there as a quote-unquote organizer,
[1:56:09.680 --> 1:56:12.680]  stopping people from engaging in conversation with me.
[1:56:12.680 --> 1:56:14.680]  You realize you're a cult leader?
[1:56:14.680 --> 1:56:16.680]  How does it feel to be a cult leader?
[1:56:16.680 --> 1:56:18.680]  We have a distraction here today.
[1:56:18.680 --> 1:56:20.680]  How does it feel to be a cult leader?
[1:56:20.680 --> 1:56:22.680]  How does it feel to be a cult minion?
[1:56:22.680 --> 1:56:24.680]  Don't touch me.
[1:56:24.680 --> 1:56:26.680]  How does it feel to be a cult minion?
[1:56:26.680 --> 1:56:28.680]  Dude, she's the one following me around,
[1:56:28.680 --> 1:56:30.680]  so why don't you see what's going on before you make a comment?
[1:56:30.680 --> 1:56:32.680]  What's wrong with info wars?
[1:56:32.680 --> 1:56:34.680]  That's not very nice.
[1:56:34.680 --> 1:56:36.680]  So-
[1:56:36.680 --> 1:56:38.680]  Right in front of their children.
[1:56:38.680 --> 1:56:40.680]  You guys don't put a very good face to your name right here.
[1:56:40.680 --> 1:56:41.680]  Here's the fart whistle.
[1:56:41.680 --> 1:56:42.680]  Your whole march looks bad now.
[1:56:42.680 --> 1:56:43.680]  Says it's not her.
[1:56:43.680 --> 1:56:44.680]  We have you on tape.
[1:56:44.680 --> 1:56:45.680]  Yeah, don't talk to me.
[1:56:45.680 --> 1:56:46.680]  I can't hold a conversation with you,
[1:56:46.680 --> 1:56:47.680]  oh, inshroyer, from info wars.
[1:56:47.680 --> 1:56:49.680]  We're not smart enough.
[1:56:49.680 --> 1:56:51.680]  We don't even know what we're out here doing.
[1:56:51.680 --> 1:56:53.680]  That's info wars.
[1:56:53.680 --> 1:56:55.680]  Oh, why?
[1:56:55.680 --> 1:56:58.680]  God, you guys suck.
[1:56:58.680 --> 1:56:59.680]  Here, I'll give you one more chance.
[1:56:59.680 --> 1:57:01.680]  Tell me why you're out here marching.
[1:57:01.680 --> 1:57:03.680]  Or tell me why info wars is bad.
[1:57:03.680 --> 1:57:05.680]  Go ahead.
[1:57:05.680 --> 1:57:07.680]  Well, I'm coming to the real news.
[1:57:07.680 --> 1:57:08.680]  Thank you.
[1:57:08.680 --> 1:57:10.680]  Yeah, so you can't answer the question.
[1:57:10.680 --> 1:57:12.680]  The organizers here, and I just want to let you know this.
[1:57:12.680 --> 1:57:13.680]  There she is again.
[1:57:13.680 --> 1:57:14.680]  Jones's news organization.
[1:57:14.680 --> 1:57:18.680]  The organizers did ask people not to engage with counter protesters
[1:57:18.680 --> 1:57:20.680]  and the alt-right media.
[1:57:20.680 --> 1:57:23.680]  So you definitely have an excuse to just say interviews over if you wish,
[1:57:23.680 --> 1:57:25.680]  but you're also welcome to keep talking.
[1:57:25.680 --> 1:57:28.680]  So you're going to let her control you like a cult leader?
[1:57:28.680 --> 1:57:30.680]  I am happy to talk to you about Hillary.
[1:57:30.680 --> 1:57:32.680]  She's a cult leader.
[1:57:32.680 --> 1:57:34.680]  She's out here stopping people from having free speech.
[1:57:34.680 --> 1:57:35.680]  So there you go, folks.
[1:57:35.680 --> 1:57:36.680]  The full video will be on the Alex Jones channel.
[1:57:36.680 --> 1:57:37.680]  We've got more.
[1:57:37.680 --> 1:57:38.680]  I mean, it's just insane.
[1:57:38.680 --> 1:57:40.680]  These people are in a cult.
[1:57:40.680 --> 1:57:41.680]  They hate free speech.
[1:57:41.680 --> 1:57:42.680]  They hate the Second Amendment.
[1:57:42.680 --> 1:57:43.680]  They want to be slaves.
[1:57:43.680 --> 1:58:11.680]  You stay classy, info warriors.
[1:58:11.680 --> 1:58:13.680]  I don't know if that's the only way we can go back.
[1:58:13.680 --> 1:58:16.680]  We just have to act.
[1:58:16.680 --> 1:58:17.680]  We have to have a moral strategy.
[1:58:17.680 --> 1:58:19.680]  We have to take over our whole country,
[1:58:19.680 --> 1:58:22.680]  we have to be homophobia and homophobia to smash windows,
[1:58:22.680 --> 1:58:24.680]  burn cars, shut down interstates and airports,
[1:58:24.680 --> 1:58:26.680]  bully and terrorize the law abiding,
[1:58:26.680 --> 1:58:29.680]  until the only option left is for the police to do their jobs
[1:58:29.680 --> 1:58:33.680]  and stop the madness.
[1:58:33.680 --> 1:58:36.680]  And when that happens, they'll use it as an excuse for their outrage.
[1:58:36.680 --> 1:58:40.680]  The only way we stop this, the only way we save our country
[1:58:40.680 --> 1:58:48.080]  I'm the National Rifle Association of America, and I'm Freedom's Safest Place.
[1:58:48.080 --> 1:58:54.400]  I want to plow into all of this, but I'm going to spend a few minutes here first just encouraging
[1:58:54.400 --> 1:59:01.920]  listeners to understand that when you buy t-shirts or water filtration systems or books or videos
[1:59:01.920 --> 1:59:08.040]  or other material from infostore.com, you are funding the revolution.
[1:59:08.040 --> 1:59:14.200]  I cannot say it any clearer, and so it is essential that you purchase the products at infowarstore.com.
[1:59:14.200 --> 1:59:17.800]  I want to thank everybody that has, but we've got the best fluoride-free toothpaste with
[1:59:17.800 --> 1:59:23.240]  colloidal silver and with high-quality atomic iodine, and you cannot beat that for children
[1:59:23.240 --> 1:59:24.240]  and adults.
[1:59:24.240 --> 1:59:28.000]  We've got the best mouthwash designed by Dr. Jones, that's my dad, with colloidal silver
[1:59:28.000 --> 1:59:35.840]  and iodine as well, infowarslife.com, or AAA-253-3139, and your purchase of the products stands
[1:59:35.840 --> 1:59:39.360]  with us, stands with America, stands with Trump, stands against the globalists and their
[1:59:39.360 --> 1:59:43.600]  satanic pedophile armies, and that's who they are, and they know we know who they are, and
[1:59:43.600 --> 1:59:56.320]  they're coming back against us so we need your support.
