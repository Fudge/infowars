[00:00.000 --> 00:02.820]  Well, here we are ladies and gentlemen Thanksgiving
[00:03.900 --> 00:09.020]  One of the few true Americana holidays that we've got probably my favorite holiday
[00:09.660 --> 00:17.060]  The 23rd day of November 2017. We've seen total demonization of the Italian Christopher Columbus
[00:18.580 --> 00:23.740]  We've seen the total demonization of Thanksgiving. We've seen attempts to get rid of the holiday
[00:25.020 --> 00:26.820]  to use it to
[00:26.820 --> 00:31.960]  cast aspersions on Western civilization and Western expansion that undoubtedly
[00:32.820 --> 00:35.800]  Was a mess and there were crimes on all sides
[00:36.400 --> 00:42.560]  When I say all sides it wasn't just the settlers or it wasn't just the troops or it wasn't just the empires
[00:42.680 --> 00:44.760]  Or it wasn't just all the different native tribes
[00:45.680 --> 00:53.100]  It was all of those different countless changing factions that played into this long
[00:53.100 --> 00:55.100]  colonized
[00:57.180 --> 01:04.800]  North America the Viking certainly visited it for a thousand years before Christopher Columbus supposedly discovered it. That's now documented
[01:05.860 --> 01:10.940]  But long before white men ever colonized it all the native tribes did
[01:12.100 --> 01:16.460]  Was run around and try to dominate and control each other and take over
[01:17.380 --> 01:19.380]  and kill the men and
[01:19.380 --> 01:24.780]  Then take the women and the children the same stuff that was going on in Europe for 10,000 years
[01:24.940 --> 01:30.900]  Same stuff going on in Africa for 10,000 years the same stuff going on everywhere in the world
[01:31.580 --> 01:33.580]  humans acted the same and
[01:34.340 --> 01:36.340]  so we never see
[01:36.860 --> 01:43.580]  Big pieces being done on the bad things that the Native Americans did or you know the way they behaved because
[01:43.900 --> 01:45.900]  It's not part of the liberation theology
[01:45.900 --> 01:51.060]  starting in the 50s the Ford Foundation the Carnegie Endowment
[01:51.500 --> 01:55.260]  Created liberation theology where they thought talked it Jesus would have
[01:56.020 --> 02:02.480]  You know fought back and was a revolutionary and hated capitalism. I was a communist and so they got
[02:03.660 --> 02:10.180]  The different populations that were Christian poor black Hispanic you name it to become liberation
[02:10.380 --> 02:11.980]  Theologist and that was just one part of it
[02:11.980 --> 02:16.220]  But to teach that in the schools to everybody that America was bad the founders were bad
[02:16.420 --> 02:25.940]  this was an undermining of the nation-state and our ethos where we came from so that people of color particularly wouldn't have a
[02:26.860 --> 02:29.860]  Idea in their head that they had a right to the American birthright
[02:30.700 --> 02:32.700]  Or that they'd been part
[02:32.780 --> 02:34.780]  Critical parts of this great saga
[02:35.500 --> 02:37.980]  No, it's all just you were good
[02:37.980 --> 02:44.140]  But you were exploited and the whites were bad when it was way more complex with whites that were an injured servants and
[02:45.060 --> 02:50.380]  bounties and people basically the slaves and company stores and sharecroppers
[02:51.700 --> 02:56.780]  But they just continue to play on the incredible ignorance the public the last few weeks CNN claims
[02:56.780 --> 03:01.460]  They've broken the news that there's slave auctions in Libya broken the news
[03:01.460 --> 03:09.180]  In seven different Muslim countries they sell women on top slave blocks, you know up on a stage
[03:09.740 --> 03:12.180]  And it's all known it's Muslims doing it
[03:12.180 --> 03:19.460]  But all these reports from CNN breaking, you know this supposed news that we've been talking about forever and others have been documenting
[03:20.980 --> 03:26.940]  It's about oh the poor migrants the poor babies the poor the poor migrants these are people in Africa
[03:26.940 --> 03:32.220]  That are being kidnapped and grabbed and sold into slavery by Muslims
[03:32.220 --> 03:36.140]  But somehow they turn it into quote Muslims by using the term migrant
[03:36.140 --> 03:39.860]  That's the new definition of Muslims is a migrant never a Muslim invader
[03:40.060 --> 03:45.140]  So they take Muslims of slaving people and then turn it into the catch-all word of poor little Muslims
[03:46.220 --> 03:48.220]  Which is migrating
[03:48.500 --> 03:54.380]  So they know what they're doing ladies and gentlemen, but we're gonna be covering that a lot more here during the transmission
[03:54.380 --> 04:00.220]  But I'm proud of Thanksgiving and I give thanks to you the audience. Thanks to God. Thanks to my family. Thanks to the great crew
[04:00.700 --> 04:02.700]  And I just want to thank you all for what you've done
[04:02.860 --> 04:09.340]  We have extended the specials from earlier in the week as we plan to do but we have new specials that are added each day

[05:01.660 --> 05:04.580]  Here about to take off few days for Thanksgiving
[05:04.580 --> 05:12.020]  And I just want to impart my message to the listeners and viewers of how much I appreciate you and how thankful I am and
[05:13.220 --> 05:14.900]  I also just want to
[05:14.900 --> 05:19.640]  re-emphasize the point that if you weren't there taking action and if you weren't there spreading the word
[05:20.580 --> 05:23.740]  Globalism would have completely taken over not just this country, but other nations
[05:24.260 --> 05:30.420]  And globalism is a completely anti individual anti God anti family anti Christian
[05:31.340 --> 05:33.340]  cancer that is just pure
[05:33.340 --> 05:34.740]  power
[05:34.740 --> 05:38.340]  cult will to dominate and control society and
[05:38.820 --> 05:44.100]  Then we have come so far with God's help and have turned the tide but the enemy is tracking back
[05:44.100 --> 05:49.340]  So just please we should all be so thankful to God and thankful to each other for taking action
[05:50.020 --> 05:55.220]  Also, girt ourselves and get ready for the next big fight ahead because history is happening
[05:55.220 --> 06:06.580]  So for myself and my family, God bless you all. Have a great Thanksgiving
[06:06.580 --> 06:18.020]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance
[06:18.020 --> 06:20.020]  I
[06:34.260 --> 06:36.580]  Ladies and gentlemen Hollywood Babylon
[06:37.460 --> 06:41.500]  Has absolutely poisoned our country and poisoned the world
[06:41.820 --> 06:46.020]  It has been a weaponized culture system to attack families
[06:46.020 --> 06:55.260]  To attack civilization to attack our sovereignty and now it's in a lot of trouble imploding in on itself
[06:55.260 --> 06:59.780]  But Charles Manson is dead part of an MK ultra mind control program
[07:01.260 --> 07:05.540]  We're gonna be talking about that more coming up at the bottom of the hour also Google launches colossal
[07:06.060 --> 07:09.300]  censorship a disinformation campaign under the dead of night
[07:10.940 --> 07:14.380]  Men's shaving company attacks toxic masculinity and new ad
[07:14.380 --> 07:18.900]  Says being strong being honorable being stoic is bad. Stop it
[07:19.340 --> 07:24.940]  This is the total demoralization and then the big news that I'm gonna cover again after our guest leaves us
[07:27.580 --> 07:32.060]  Experts were predicting over the weekend a great crash of 2018 will start the bond market
[07:33.980 --> 07:39.660]  Today the euro crashed massively with Angela Merkel's fourth term as Chancellor in doubt
[07:39.660 --> 07:45.300]  And her plan to flood Europe with Islamist as US growth forecaster on the rise
[07:45.300 --> 07:49.780]  I've talked to top globalist on-air and off-air former top globalist
[07:49.900 --> 07:54.500]  and I've been contact with other over the years people that are high up billionaires you name it and
[07:55.740 --> 08:00.420]  They filled me in a lot of things saying that I was basically dead on about what was happening and who had told me
[08:00.420 --> 08:04.460]  I could just see it. It really isn't in the news, but you can
[08:04.460 --> 08:10.540]  Follow the trends and the different angles
[08:11.020 --> 08:17.140]  The globalist made a deal with the euro and with China to deindustrialize the US as a political system of control
[08:17.500 --> 08:22.300]  and implode us and turn us into a third-world country just like they've done to South Africa and
[08:25.300 --> 08:29.020]  Trump and others are battling that and so it's not just like hey
[08:29.020 --> 08:32.660]  We're fighting to get the economy up and keep the stock market propped up as a bubble
[08:32.660 --> 08:37.180]  Just because that's fun because it is unhealthy long-term, but we're in a financial war now
[08:37.180 --> 08:41.580]  We have to keep it propped up until the euro implodes because it's a cancerous authoritarian
[08:42.220 --> 08:48.980]  System that is opening the borders to carry out the cultural genocide against Christians and whites and again
[08:49.220 --> 08:55.020]  The minorities coming in aren't even the enemy. It's the globalist directing at all and they admit it
[08:56.620 --> 09:01.660]  Now the reason this all dovetails in is because it's a planetary plan
[09:01.660 --> 09:03.420]  and
[09:03.420 --> 09:05.420]  We have Simon Roche on
[09:06.500 --> 09:09.940]  Who is a prominent activist an individual?
[09:10.460 --> 09:16.980]  Who's been exposing the massive white genocide in South Africa in Zimbabwe in
[09:18.220 --> 09:23.700]  Many of these other African countries where everybody's now basically starving to death they have epic
[09:23.700 --> 09:31.620]  Why my republican flation because they've driven any infrastructure out. It's just a thing of conquest. So
[09:32.020 --> 09:39.860]  South Africans hold Black Monday protests over white farmer murders. That's news week murders of white farmers spark protests in South Africa
[09:40.540 --> 09:42.380]  That's CBS news
[09:42.380 --> 09:48.100]  Epidemic of South African farm murders continues as gunman shoot elderly victims dead now
[09:48.100 --> 09:54.140]  These are groups of A and C connected black communists doing it put the whole Black Lives Matter thing
[09:54.140 --> 09:58.500]  It's like international and you've got a lot of other black groups saying we don't want this is a terrible
[09:58.500 --> 10:01.980]  But look at Zimbabwe and I'm not the expert like this gentleman Zimbabwe
[10:03.020 --> 10:08.060]  Where you've got Robert Mugabe and all the rest of it has basically killed all the white farmers tens of thousands
[10:08.060 --> 10:11.100]  They're all gone. The few that stayed have all been killed
[10:11.860 --> 10:16.860]  Okay, so what you see in Zimbabwe is not going to be South Africa and this is directed
[10:16.860 --> 10:19.860]  This is planned and we've got an expert on
[10:21.340 --> 10:23.340]  To go over
[10:23.940 --> 10:25.940]  That information for us
[10:27.060 --> 10:32.340]  Simon Roche is head of the office of HQ of the world's largest non-state civil defense organization
[10:32.340 --> 10:38.580]  And I'm not gonna pronounce it right a two landers of South Africa once an A and C activist
[10:38.580 --> 10:42.980]  He now works tirelessly to prepare for impending catastrophe in the rainbow nation
[10:42.980 --> 10:46.820]  Simon lives in Johannesburg, and it's the proud father of many children
[10:46.820 --> 10:52.340]  And we'll probably have to go 40 after so if you can because I've got to move it like this is so important to break down
[10:52.340 --> 10:58.740]  We can also show how they first disarmed everybody and now they're able to kill them and how the government basically goes along with this
[10:58.820 --> 11:01.820]  So it's su id la ind
[11:02.460 --> 11:04.060]  er s and
[11:04.060 --> 11:07.300]  Folks it is total breakdown of civilization there
[11:07.300 --> 11:14.020]  This is happening and so you're gonna see the whole continent now basically collapse Libya has been destroyed by the globalists now
[11:14.020 --> 11:19.660]  They're gonna bring down South Africa using their race-based communist narrative Simon Roche. You're the expert
[11:20.420 --> 11:25.820]  So I just gave my gestalt snapshot from America. Was that accurate or was that inaccurate?
[11:27.100 --> 11:30.580]  No, that's just about accurate for a long time. We've been
[11:30.580 --> 11:36.500]  Uh predicting these things. We're not high bound by doctrine as many people are, you know
[11:36.500 --> 11:41.760]  They're supposed to conform to the narrative of the new South African rainbow nation our organization
[11:42.380 --> 11:45.540]  St. London's the largest of its kind in the world as you said
[11:46.580 --> 11:54.420]  operates on facts statistics data true information and it is very much the way that you've described is an ongoing decline in
[11:55.140 --> 11:59.060]  South Africa particularly or Southern Africa and it is
[11:59.060 --> 12:04.820]  Indisputably driven by globalist capital forces. That's beyond any sort of doubt
[12:06.500 --> 12:10.860]  We can go to your website to see examples of the carnage the murder of the death of people that don't know
[12:10.860 --> 12:13.980]  Can you describe the the forces in South Africa?
[12:15.620 --> 12:22.740]  Well, the South African political scene is dominated by the African National Congress government of Nelson Mandela fame
[12:23.660 --> 12:25.100]  They are now
[12:25.100 --> 12:30.620]  challenged very heavily for their original political territory by a
[12:31.660 --> 12:33.660]  Leninist Stalinist
[12:33.900 --> 12:37.700]  Political party called the economic freedom fighters whose
[12:38.260 --> 12:45.740]  leader very famously in recent months has said that blacks should invade white farms with the spear in the hand
[12:45.820 --> 12:49.500]  He's also the guy who said on the 7th of November last year that
[12:49.500 --> 12:58.320]  He's not calling for the slaughter of all whites yet. And there's a very very influential tribal leader in South Africa said to me
[12:58.820 --> 13:03.700]  Simon in English or European idiom that could mean many things in
[13:04.460 --> 13:09.820]  African idiom that means only one thing he's telling his supporters that at some point
[13:09.820 --> 13:14.660]  but not now he is going to call upon them to slaughter all of the whites and
[13:14.660 --> 13:19.700]  They should prepare for it whether people like that or not. That's that's the reality
[13:20.660 --> 13:25.540]  That we're facing at the moment and it gets worse and worse, you know, the African National Congress Alex
[13:28.420 --> 13:32.980]  Maintains its Mkhonto where sees where spear of the nation armed wing
[13:33.140 --> 13:39.180]  So it's probably the only political party in the world that besides being the governing force and having a defense force
[13:39.180 --> 13:47.060]  Also has its armed wing and the head of of the armed wing the Mkhonto where sees where in our largest most populous province
[13:47.340 --> 13:53.820]  Said a few months ago that it is now time for young blacks to go to training camps in the bush in South Africa
[13:54.180 --> 13:56.900]  To learn to kill whites in a civil war
[13:57.300 --> 14:05.340]  So those are the main parties the extreme left party the the ANC and then of course there's the the minor white population of about
[14:05.500 --> 14:06.940]  eight and a half percent
[14:06.940 --> 14:10.220]  Would and we believe that we are going to be on the receiving end of this
[14:12.700 --> 14:18.340]  Now for those that again have it studied the different topography in the different areas you've got
[14:20.660 --> 14:22.020]  The
[14:22.020 --> 14:25.620]  quasi-communist government before and I guess it's just getting more and more radicalized
[14:26.060 --> 14:34.180]  By its far left and I read their own plans and their own statements and the people being murdered every day now and the riots and the
[14:34.180 --> 14:42.100]  The looting of the infrastructure and it sounds just like what anti-fun black lives matter and the sorrows funded groups are doing over here
[14:43.380 --> 14:46.300]  It's it's very similar the similarities are terrific
[14:46.300 --> 14:50.740]  I've just spent six months in the USA going from one end to the other over
[14:51.620 --> 14:58.620]  27,000 miles worth of driving visiting decent respectable bright-eyed fresh faced very nice people
[14:58.620 --> 15:03.720]  To talk with them about this problem and to endeavor to raise funds because we we saw
[15:04.300 --> 15:10.220]  Very very close to a crisis and we need to very urgently give whatever we're gonna talk about that
[15:10.220 --> 15:15.900]  We're gonna talk about your emergency. We're gonna about your emergency plan because again some people are just saying hey
[15:15.900 --> 15:20.460]  You should just leave well a lot of people you can't leave a lot of companies won't take you
[15:20.580 --> 15:26.700]  But I mean explain what's happening there when we come back from break and the emergency plan because as you said already
[15:26.700 --> 15:33.140]  South Africa is one of the highest crime rates in the world. It's collapsing. The populations are just killing each other in mass
[15:33.820 --> 15:39.260]  People believe if you rape a baby if you have HIV that it makes you well. I mean, it's just descending
[15:40.060 --> 15:42.060]  back into absolute
[15:42.180 --> 15:48.940]  Barbarism and I got to ask you why not just evacuate and then it's very sad these folks will all just kill each other
[15:48.940 --> 15:56.980]  For whatever reason, it's very very sad. We'll be right back. Stay with us

[17:56.320 --> 18:03.840]  Thousands of years ago. There was a basic form of chivalry
[18:03.840 --> 18:11.320]  Our ancestors would hear the drums of war giving the warriors of the tribe a chance to organize and prepare a defense
[18:11.920 --> 18:17.080]  60 years ago when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs
[18:17.120 --> 18:21.800]  They had drums of their own air raid sirens, but in the 21st century
[18:21.800 --> 18:27.120]  There are silent weapons for quiet war tassin engines added to the food and water
[18:27.120 --> 18:34.400]  And is aligning the plastics that destroy our vitality turn off our hormones and accelerate our journey towards death

[18:58.280 --> 19:01.960]  I know I don't have to remind most of you of the fact that culturally
[19:02.560 --> 19:03.720]  societally
[19:03.720 --> 19:04.760]  economically
[19:04.760 --> 19:05.920]  spiritually
[19:05.920 --> 19:10.880]  militarily the planet sitting on top of giant time with populations and
[19:10.880 --> 19:14.800]  The globalism and the new world order's manipulation of people's minds
[19:15.680 --> 19:19.400]  Things are getting crazy. We're trying to fix the country and fix the plan
[19:19.720 --> 19:25.960]  We've also got to have rearguard actions to be prepared the number one thing I forget right with God is that high-quality
[19:26.240 --> 19:32.600]  Sortable food well the entire line of my patriot supply foods private label as in for select is now
[19:33.320 --> 19:36.400]  50% off we've only done that one time before previously
[19:36.400 --> 19:42.280]  50% off you cannot beat that and we're only doing that through cyber Monday
[19:42.280 --> 19:47.240]  So it starts today on Thanksgiving and runs through next Monday info or store.com
[19:47.560 --> 19:55.480]  You go right there. It's the full spectrum. My patriot is private label by us totally fresh less 25 years 50% off
[19:55.880 --> 19:57.880]  50% off take action today
[19:57.880 --> 20:04.440]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show
[20:04.440 --> 20:26.560]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance you're listening to Alex Jones
[20:26.560 --> 20:33.040]  Simon Roche is the head of the office of the HQ of the world's largest non-state civil defense organization
[20:34.400 --> 20:36.400]  in South Africa and
[20:36.760 --> 20:42.200]  In many other countries once communists take over or leftists take over they slowly
[20:42.520 --> 20:49.280]  Isolate the whites put them basically in controlled areas farm ghettos and then start exterminating them
[20:49.800 --> 20:54.400]  That's now accelerated in South Africa. It's been basically complete in Zimbabwe
[20:54.400 --> 21:00.640]  Tens of thousands of whites killed the leftist media and the West celebrates it. They teach at major universities
[21:00.640 --> 21:05.560]  It's good and now the second most powerful party in South Africa is set to take power
[21:06.040 --> 21:12.600]  Openly saying they will kill every white left 8% of the population in South Africa
[21:12.880 --> 21:14.880]  Now you can say we'll just get out of there
[21:14.880 --> 21:18.080]  Well, a lot of Western countries won't take people out of South Africa
[21:18.080 --> 21:22.200]  But that's kind of a UN globalist thing is they don't want whites going to nations that had whites
[21:22.200 --> 21:26.640]  This is a globalist attack on whites run by elite whites
[21:27.360 --> 21:34.480]  In in every case, so you have to ask yourself flood countries with non whites and then say whites get out
[21:34.720 --> 21:40.560]  Well, you can argue, you know, obviously Africa whites colonize that but the issue is globalists are now reverse
[21:40.920 --> 21:45.680]  Colonizing using third world populations to flood first world nations to drive down wages
[21:46.280 --> 21:47.960]  And then exploit those countries
[21:47.960 --> 21:52.320]  So once the whites are all out of South Africa, which has already happened in other countries, it's going to fully collapse
[21:52.320 --> 21:55.200]  That's my view on it. Talk about your emergency plan
[21:55.760 --> 22:01.000]  Simon and just how dire the situation is and tell the folks here in the US and around the world
[22:01.360 --> 22:06.920]  What it's like to be there because I know they've taken most your guns in the last decade or so and of course now
[22:06.920 --> 22:08.920]  That's accelerated the white genocide
[22:10.160 --> 22:14.200]  Yeah, absolutely. The the best thought on this is dr. Gregory Stanton of
[22:14.200 --> 22:18.880]  Genocide watch of Washington DC who's written extensively about this
[22:18.880 --> 22:24.800]  And there's nobody in the world who compares to him as an expert on genocide and he said that clearly
[22:25.000 --> 22:27.000]  We are heading towards an open genocide
[22:27.960 --> 22:32.520]  I think that the key thing for people to understand Alex is the
[22:33.080 --> 22:35.840]  Statistics rather than the sentiment the opinion, you know
[22:35.920 --> 22:42.320]  The reality is that the chances of a white farmer in South Africa being murdered on his farm
[22:42.320 --> 22:48.440]  Are more than double the chances of a policeman in this violent society being killed
[22:48.640 --> 22:55.400]  Now when a man who kills the soil stands more than twice the chance of a crime fighter in a violent society dying
[22:55.480 --> 23:02.240]  Then you know that there's something wrong the the statistical likelihood of a white person being murdered by a black person in South Africa
[23:02.360 --> 23:04.360]  is more than
[23:05.000 --> 23:11.520]  12,000 percent higher than any black person in the USA ever stood of being lynched
[23:11.520 --> 23:15.280]  I'm we're not condoning lynching. We're saying get a sense of perspective
[23:15.280 --> 23:19.440]  The persecution of whites in Africa serious the persecution of whites in Africa is
[23:20.200 --> 23:24.200]  Larger than persecution statistically that's been done to blacks in this country
[23:24.920 --> 23:27.360]  By more than 12,000 percent. That's correct
[23:28.760 --> 23:30.280]  Continue
[23:30.280 --> 23:37.280]  Well, our national emergency plan is an entirely peaceful plan. We're non insurrectionist non seditionist
[23:37.280 --> 23:42.560]  We're not here to cause trouble. We're here to look after innocent women children and
[23:43.440 --> 23:45.440]  Non-able-bodied people and the elderly
[23:45.720 --> 23:53.340]  We're here in the event of an open civil war in this country a race-based civil war such as black leaders have been promising us
[23:53.600 --> 24:00.680]  Particularly since August of last year when our former judge president said that we're staring a race-based civil war in the face
[24:00.680 --> 24:03.520]  And so on and so forth over over the intervening year
[24:03.520 --> 24:11.280]  We are here to protect ordinary people to prepare to look after white people in the event of the civil war
[24:11.280 --> 24:17.720]  That we are being promised by black leaders. It's a national emergency plan. It extends over the entire country
[24:17.720 --> 24:24.000]  It has been in place since 2006. We are prepared and by the way, you know, it's gonna happen
[24:24.000 --> 24:29.880]  This is happening how many other African countries I can think of for in the last 50 years that it starts the exact same way
[24:29.880 --> 24:34.480]  And then all of a sudden everybody's wiped out. Yeah, absolutely
[24:34.480 --> 24:39.040]  That's that's the way it's done and the irony of it is that it's not driven by those people
[24:39.040 --> 24:45.080]  They are driven by an ideology that's given to them by somebody else, you know, this is my next point
[24:45.080 --> 24:50.840]  Charlie Manson just died. He pushed this whole kill the white thing because the university taught him
[24:50.840 --> 24:56.520]  Why are the big banks? Why are the mega rich funding this this this ideology and tell us what the ideology is?
[24:56.520 --> 25:05.320]  The ideology is a form of communism, but ultimately what it comes down to is an anti-European Christian tradition
[25:05.320 --> 25:10.120]  That's fundamentally what it comes down to. If you see what's being done in the world today
[25:10.120 --> 25:14.520]  It's being directed at Christian conservative Europeans
[25:14.520 --> 25:18.520]  Ultimately, we are the people for whatever reason it may be
[25:18.520 --> 25:24.520]  Whether it's in North America or in Europe who are on the receiving end of this relentless assault
[25:24.520 --> 25:32.520]  Against our culture, traditions, religion, history and our dignity and our pride. This is a consistent thing
[25:32.520 --> 25:38.520]  Well, it's because the new global system is coming in and it wants to erase any system that won't be absorbed
[25:38.520 --> 25:42.520]  And that's strong and that's why it's being directed by George Soros
[25:42.520 --> 25:45.520]  He admittedly is directing a lot of the South African stuff
[25:45.520 --> 25:52.520]  Well, Alex, you know, our leader and founder, Garber, the name of Gustav Müller has been writing about this and talking about this
[25:52.520 --> 26:00.520]  For nearly 20 years and for a long time people thought that he was, you know, off his tree or however you like to put it
[26:00.520 --> 26:04.520]  That he was crazy, but over time it's become more and more and more and more and more conspicuous
[26:04.520 --> 26:10.520]  And thank God for that because it validates us and we don't look like the crazies anymore
[26:10.520 --> 26:16.520]  Thank God for what's happening in the USA and what's happening in Europe because now we're in a position to say to people
[26:16.520 --> 26:23.520]  Hey, don't trust us, trust your own eyes, look what's being done and to whom it is being done
[26:23.520 --> 26:35.520]  And who is driving it in the end? This liberalist, post-modernist, moral-relativist, humanist assault on everything that is moral absolutist
[26:35.520 --> 26:40.520]  On everything that is firm and that is fixed is now pervasive in the Western world
[26:40.520 --> 26:49.520]  The Jacobin French Revolution, it's very same ideology, it's never been cut, it's never been totally defeated, it just keeps moving around like a cancer
[26:49.520 --> 26:57.520]  Yeah, it is like a cancer, it is, and at the moment it's expressing itself something terrible in South Africa
[26:57.520 --> 27:02.520]  The rate of rape and murder and what have you is just phenomenal, you know, I saw some of those papers that you had in your hand
[27:02.520 --> 27:09.520]  And it said elderly couple shot, whatever, and I couldn't help but think to myself, that's not a good example
[27:09.520 --> 27:15.520]  You know, with all due respect, the good examples are the elderly couple that had boiling water poured over them
[27:15.520 --> 27:24.520]  Or the elderly gentleman who recently got locked up in his Ford truck and trussed up and then the truck set on fire and burned to death
[27:24.520 --> 27:30.520]  Or the little girl who was raped, the four-year-old girl who was raped by three men, survived it
[27:30.520 --> 27:35.520]  And because she survived, you know, this was proven in the post-mortem autopsy
[27:35.520 --> 27:40.520]  She was then bundled up in newspaper with gasoline poured over it and then set on fire
[27:40.520 --> 27:46.520]  Or the girl who was crucified on her parents kitchen table and then raped a three-year-old girl in this instance
[27:46.520 --> 27:56.520]  The three-year-old girl raped by four men while crucified to her parents kitchen table after her father had had his throat slit and her mother had been killed as well
[27:56.520 --> 28:01.520]  You know, it is beyond people's imagination what we're in at the moment
[28:01.520 --> 28:10.520]  Well, I want to talk about how people can shine light on this because just like genocide watching others, whether it's an Asian group being killed or an African group being killed
[28:10.520 --> 28:20.520]  Or people in Latin America, I mean, I'm against any of these genocides, but the UN even admits that in the last decade, Christians are the number one targeted group and the targetings doubled
[28:20.520 --> 28:29.520]  Just like we saw the UN and the globalists at NATO involved in the Middle East and Syria targeting Christians, they will go out of their way to kill Christians
[28:29.520 --> 28:33.520]  And it is a program. Look at China, the Christians are being killed
[28:33.520 --> 28:42.520]  But anybody else peaceful, the Buddhists are being killed, will be right back and their organs taken. We'll be right back. I'm Alex Jones. This is the info war

[31:08.520 --> 31:16.520]  With populations and globalism and the new world order's manipulation of people's minds, things are getting crazy
[31:16.520 --> 31:22.520]  We're trying to fix the country and fix the planet. We've also got to have rear guard actions to be prepared
[31:22.520 --> 31:31.520]  The number one thing after getting right with God is to have high-quality, durable food. Well, the entire line of my patriot supply foods, private labeled as info war select

[33:23.520 --> 33:27.520]  You want answers? Well, so does he
[33:27.520 --> 33:53.520]  Live from Austin, Texas, Broadcasting Worldwide, it's Alex Jones
[33:57.520 --> 34:02.520]  Bezos is the CIA folks, look into his dad, all of it, never ends
[34:02.520 --> 34:12.520]  And then meanwhile, Trump to Lavar Ball, I should have left them all in jail, these people are there caught shoplifting, it's like 10 years in jail in China
[34:12.520 --> 34:18.520]  Trump gets them out, China admits that the president interceded and the family says, we don't appreciate you because you're Trump
[34:18.520 --> 34:28.520]  I mean, it's just the entitlement and the craziness and just all the weirdness is so sad to see
[34:28.520 --> 34:37.520]  And then to see countries that the globalist social engineers wreck, they put communist in, then they extract the resources for almost nothing and the Africans don't get it
[34:37.520 --> 34:43.520]  Whether they be white or black, because when you've been there 300 years, like some of these folks are longer, you can call yourself an African
[34:43.520 --> 34:52.520]  And again, it's not all the tribes doing it, it's always the ones that get organized and I know there's different factions, you've got the Zulus and you've got all the other tribes kind of into the ANC
[34:52.520 --> 34:59.520]  I don't live there, I'm an expert, but I know that pretty much all that's left is the farmers that are kind of like what you'd call Amish
[34:59.520 --> 35:08.520]  In fact, a lot of them I guess come from Amish, from the Dutch and German derivation, and I've read that I guess the Southlanders organization has some connections
[35:08.520 --> 35:16.520]  Describe the background of your group, because again, I've researched it, but there's a lot of different subgroups, who are some of the different groups there in Africa?
[35:16.520 --> 35:22.520]  Who are you trying to organize together? Because I mean, you're the bread basket of much of Africa, everybody knows that, who studied it
[35:22.520 --> 35:32.520]  And then it's shown once you get overthrown and just kicked off your land that you've developed that people see and want, it always goes out of cultivation and falls apart
[35:32.520 --> 35:41.520]  So again, why are the communists pushing so hard to get you out? I guess because the internationalists want to bring down stability so they can exploit the population better
[35:41.520 --> 35:43.520]  They don't want civilization
[35:43.520 --> 35:50.520]  Well it's that, and they're also absolutely devoted to this idea of destroying this European Christian tradition
[35:50.520 --> 35:55.520]  Whether people like it or not, they only need to look at the evidence, not in South Africa, but around the world of what is happening today
[35:55.520 --> 36:04.520]  Whose culture is being undermined by abortion, pornography and gay marriage and what have you, in complete contradiction to the doctrines, the prevailing doctrines
[36:04.520 --> 36:09.520]  I mean, it makes no sense no matter how you look at it, you can't defend this thing forever and ever and ever
[36:09.520 --> 36:15.520]  At some point, you've got to believe the very evidence that lies before you
[36:15.520 --> 36:30.520]  Well sure, the globalists admit this plan, so what I'm asking you is, I mean basically the organization you're with, the groups you represent, aren't you guys, I mean, basically like Amish, living in a basic Christian tradition, farming, raising your families?
[36:30.520 --> 36:34.520]  Yes, it is a very, very conservative culture
[36:34.520 --> 36:49.520]  Of course, people have televisions and modern devices and appliances and that kind of stuff, but the fundamental cultural values of the people who I represent or who St. London's is devoted to protecting
[36:49.520 --> 37:00.520]  That is to say, particularly the Africana Boer people of South Africa, also other whites, because that's how the international laws under which we are constituted legally work
[37:00.520 --> 37:07.520]  But those Africana Boer people are very, very conservative, I'll illustrate the point to you very briefly, Alex
[37:07.520 --> 37:24.520]  You know, we hold to a series of prophecies that said this crisis, the prophecies given a hundred years ago will occur at a time when a man with a placestale cape, that is to say, hair resembling a wig, will be in power in the United States
[37:24.520 --> 37:38.520]  And he will take over the reins of power from a black man, and there are various other things, I won't go on and on and on about it, but the point is that we are devoted to an ancient culture, an ancient tradition
[37:38.520 --> 37:41.520]  Well, that's intriguing now, because I want to hear about this prophecy
[37:41.520 --> 37:55.520]  Well, this chap lived, he was born in 1864, died in 1926, very pious chap, and he made a long series of prophecies in which he described that there would be three world wars
[37:55.520 --> 38:08.520]  And he said that the third world war would happen in parallel to a civil war in South Africa, a race-based civil war between the races, but ultimately driven by the globalists, which we have always said
[38:08.520 --> 38:22.520]  Anybody who can read Afrikaans language is welcome to go on our website, there are hundreds of articles that make it very, very clear that we see our first enemy, not as black people or not, it's not the black people, it is this global capitalist new world order
[38:22.520 --> 38:42.520]  He said that the third world war would happen in tandem with a crisis in South Africa, and he said it would be at a time when this man, who was a stern man, who gazes sternly, has hair resembling a wig, and he takes over the reins of the USA from a black man
[38:42.520 --> 39:02.520]  After the black man has confused the identity and the orientation of the United States, he said that would be at a time when there's a wave of black and brown skinned migrants into Europe, he was very, very explicit about it
[39:02.520 --> 39:21.520]  He said following that, there would be a global financial crisis, and he spoke particularly of the fact that the money in Europe would not be worth the paper, that the value of the paper would be greater than the amount of money that it denominated
[39:21.520 --> 39:32.520]  Anyway, I've read about this fellow before and forgot about it, and he actually, it's on record, he said all this, that he was listening to back then and it was all basically coming true, the Euro is starting to collapse right now
[39:32.520 --> 39:41.520]  Yeah, well, he lost practically all of his credibility when he made one of his final prophecies, namely that there would be a black government in South Africa
[39:41.520 --> 39:52.520]  Now, 100 years ago, everybody thought that he was just playing crazy, and they wrote him off, he said the first black ruler on the throne of South Africa would be deemed a saint by the world
[39:52.520 --> 40:05.520]  And when he died, he would be lying state in a glass coffin, and at his burial, dignitaries, he spoke about princes and rulers and so on, would come from all over the world to pay respects at his graveside
[40:05.520 --> 40:15.520]  Now, the meaning of that is very, very clear The reason I'm listening to stuff like this, there's a lot of false promises the Bible say who go out and put out this info, but people like this where it's been proven right over and over again, it's incredible
[40:15.520 --> 40:25.520]  And I personally haven't had like full on deals like this, but I've had experiences, dreams and things that came true exactly later, so that's why I know how real this stuff is
[40:25.520 --> 40:30.520]  Yeah, it can be, and I think everybody approaches this stuff with some skepticism
[40:30.520 --> 40:44.520]  My father gave me the book to read at first, and I gave it back to him very despicably, I thought it was absolute nonsense, until I began to see that what he prophesied or predicted was coming to word for word for word
[40:44.520 --> 40:52.520]  Very often in the same words that he used, and he did say that a bucket of blood would fall over in Zimbabwe
[40:52.520 --> 41:02.520]  And once that bucket of blood fell over, in other words there would be a lot of blood spilled or blood shed, he said it would come into South Africa
[41:02.520 --> 41:07.520]  So no, we don't know whether there's going to be bloodshed in Zimbabwe today, next week, next month, next year, who knows
[41:07.520 --> 41:15.520]  But these are the things that we're paying attention to because so far he's been right, and we're on the receiving end of a lot of pain at the moment
[41:15.520 --> 41:24.520]  Everybody knows somebody who's been murdered, or raped, or whose child has been raped, or who's been disfigured
[41:24.520 --> 41:35.520]  I was on a farm recently, which has eight neighboring farms, and on each of the eight neighboring farms, somebody had been killed in recent years
[41:35.520 --> 41:38.520]  Now that's, you know, it's severe
[41:38.520 --> 41:42.520]  And it's getting worse, and it's what the communists do, it's helter skelter
[41:42.520 --> 41:49.520]  Simon, I'm really impressed with the work you're doing, please come on, please have the leader of your organization on, and give us updates here
[41:49.520 --> 41:59.520]  So please stay in contact suidlanders.org, and people can, I guess, donate there to help get your civil emergency plan implemented and prepared
[41:59.520 --> 42:03.520]  Please, we would appreciate it very much, thank you Alex
[42:03.520 --> 42:06.520]  You bet, absolutely, God bless you
[42:06.520 --> 42:14.520]  That's what we're here for, ladies and gentlemen, is making preparations, because we know the enemy plan, so we have a leg up
[42:14.520 --> 42:17.520]  If we take action, if we're ready
[42:17.520 --> 42:23.520]  And again, they're trying to beat everybody into race-based garbage in the US to make us fight with each other
[42:23.520 --> 42:30.520]  We can't do it, we have to come together, love each other, see through it, and know it's class warfare that these globalists are carrying out
[42:30.520 --> 42:37.520]  But no, they hate you because you're Christian, they're announcing world government, they're announcing microchips, they're announcing this new God that Google's been developing
[42:37.520 --> 42:43.520]  That's going to be AI that you worship, like right out of Revelation, I mean, look, it's happening
[42:43.520 --> 42:48.520]  And most of the churches are cowards, and they're going along with it because they're not really churches, they just want the money
[42:48.520 --> 42:51.520]  Alright, Trump just escalated things with North Korea, we'll tell you about that
[42:51.520 --> 42:53.520]  On the other side, I'm Alex Jones
[42:53.520 --> 43:04.520]  I'm driving home here, about to take off a few days from Thanksgiving
[43:04.520 --> 43:11.520]  And I just want to impart my message to the listeners and viewers of how much I appreciate you and how thankful I am
[43:11.520 --> 43:18.520]  And I also just want to re-emphasize the point that if you weren't there taking action, and if you weren't there spreading the word
[43:18.520 --> 43:23.520]  Globalism would have completely taken over not just this country but other nations
[43:23.520 --> 43:37.520]  And globalism is a completely anti-individual, anti-God, anti-family, anti-Christian cancer that is just pure power cult will to dominate and control society
[43:37.520 --> 43:42.520]  And that we have come so far with God's help and have turned the tide but the enemy's tracking back
[43:42.520 --> 43:48.520]  So just please, we should all be so thankful to God and thankful to each other for taking action
[43:48.520 --> 43:53.520]  And also, girt ourselves and get ready for the next big fight ahead because history is happening
[43:53.520 --> 44:14.520]  So for myself and my family, God bless you all, have a great Thanksgiving
[44:23.520 --> 44:31.520]  Globalism is being a patriot who's pro-America, pro-capitalism, and pro-freedom who at the same time is tolerant
[44:31.520 --> 44:36.520]  Modern liberalism is a counterfeit of Thomas Jefferson's classical liberalism
[44:36.520 --> 44:43.520]  They are the anti-liberalists who defend free speech, meet like-minded friends, and promote freedom worldwide
[44:43.520 --> 44:53.520]  We've got more than 60 original designs of high quality t-shirts for men and women as well as more patriot apparel at infowarstore.com

[47:16.520 --> 47:29.520]  All alone, all alone in a time of need, because he's racing and racing and plotting a course, he's fighting and fighting and riding on his horse, he's going the distance
[47:29.520 --> 47:35.520]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones
[47:35.520 --> 47:53.520]  Well, Trump has declared North Korea an aider of terrorist states. That means they can stop their ships. That means they can put more sanctions on them. That means that it's just one more ratchet up towards war
[47:53.520 --> 48:08.520]  We have that story up on newswars.com and infowars.com. Then I've got all this other news. Vsauce and Deep State Unite Amazon launches cloud service for CIA. We first talked about this about a year ago when it was just in trade publications
[48:08.520 --> 48:25.520]  This has far-reaching implications. I'll explain why. Here in just a second, also Saudi Arabia vows to take on Iran amid warnings the region is in dangerous abyss. That's out of the express. We told you months ago war there is looming and may be imminent
[48:25.520 --> 48:41.520]  But the first big thing I want to get to, Charles Manson is so interesting, it's hard to not, because usually I talk about Charles Manson, people don't really make a big deal out of it because he's not in the news. But now, whenever we talk about with Manson, we'll end up getting millions of views on Facebook and Twitter in places and we'll reach new people.
[48:41.520 --> 48:59.520]  They need to know about MKUltra. They need to know about the program he was part of to destabilize and try to trigger a race war for cultural upheaval because the globalists don't want us to be Christian and to come together and not be racist. They want to claim their fighting racism while stirring everyone up to be racist.
[48:59.520 --> 49:14.520]  That's really the secret plan, which isn't a secret anymore. So we're going to talk about all that coming up. But first, expert, great crash of 2018 will start in the bond market. I saw this yesterday, did some more research.
[49:14.520 --> 49:25.520]  It is a top expert saying that. Many others are saying it too because it is so overvalued. Then I saw this this morning and I said, whoa, I better cover this.
[49:25.520 --> 49:37.520]  Euro crash with Angela Merkel's fourth term and Chancellor is in doubt as US growth forecasts are on the rise. I'm going to break this down here in a moment because it's a key.
[49:37.520 --> 49:48.520]  First off though, ladies and gentlemen, we are running specials this week that are amongst the best we ever run.
[49:48.520 --> 49:59.520]  And I've been running more and more specials as things go on because I've noticed the bigger the specials I run, the more people buy product. But there's kind of a point at which we discount things so much that it isn't really funding our operation.
[49:59.520 --> 50:08.520]  And I've lately, the accountants have shown me, I've kind of reached that point where, hey, you're selling the probiotic at $5 over what it costs.
[50:08.520 --> 50:14.520]  And then you're doing free shipping. Alex, we're losing a dollar on average stop.
[50:14.520 --> 50:20.520]  And so it really does come down to that. Brainforce Plus is now back in stock.
[50:20.520 --> 50:25.520]  We got a small shipment in. We should get a lot more towards the end of December, but it's about to be sold out again.
[50:25.520 --> 50:32.520]  50% off and free shipping. That's the first big special of Black Friday week.
[50:32.520 --> 50:44.520]  We're just going to have it right through this weekend. 50% off, 5,700 reviews by power reviews, 4.6 stars.
[50:44.520 --> 50:53.520]  And we just went out and researched the highest quality brain empowering, focus empowering, energy empowering in a healthy way, or organic substances that are known to be safe.
[50:53.520 --> 51:00.520]  And we put it in there and we sell it for $39 when similar compounds are 70 to 80.
[51:00.520 --> 51:08.520]  And we sell it for 50% off, ladies and gentlemen. 50% off, it is $19.96.
[51:08.520 --> 51:16.520]  I mean, that is a great, great deal on a really, really powerful brain pill.
[51:16.520 --> 51:26.520]  Brainforce Plus now with 20% more capsules in each bottle, which was a big deal for us to do because it cost a lot, some of the compounds.
[51:26.520 --> 51:32.520]  And beloved, though, it is the overall total best seller that we show up at such a low price. It doesn't really fund the operation.
[51:32.520 --> 51:35.520]  X2 is one of our other top sellers. Superman is a great seller.
[51:35.520 --> 51:43.520]  The problem is it's made of a proprietary system cold press, so it's hard to always get it California standards, which is impossible to pass, basically, and then have enough of a cold press.
[51:43.520 --> 51:54.520]  So it's sold out half the time. We've got that back in, but we've got a bunch of specials. We're going to be running new specials every single day.
[51:54.520 --> 51:58.520]  We've got Pro Pure 25% off on that water filtration and free shipping.
[51:58.520 --> 52:03.520]  Brainforce Plus 25% off. So that is the specials that we've got for you today.
[52:03.520 --> 52:16.520]  We have the new products, Fluorolife, and we also have the carnivore digestive enzyme that helps absorb the nutrients and amino acids out of the meat and out of the protein and out of the fat and out of the carbohydrates.
[52:16.520 --> 52:25.520]  Fluorolife Advanced Restoration 50 million live and then we have the 15 million everyday maintenance that's excellent as well and carnivore now in stock.
[52:25.520 --> 52:30.520]  Try them out for yourself. We just commit to get these products. You help fund the operation and you help yourself.
[52:30.520 --> 52:34.520]  But when I remember to take all this stuff, it makes my life so much better than I forget.
[52:34.520 --> 52:39.520]  Then I wonder why I'm sluggish or why I'm not as stuff in my gut as perfect.
[52:39.520 --> 52:46.520]  And it's like, oh wait, we have these things God gave us through nature that we've gone out and sourced and got the very best stuff that works really well.
[52:46.520 --> 52:51.520]  And it's here and it's very, very popular. But that's how, again, we fund this operation.
[52:51.520 --> 52:58.520]  So I want to thank you all for your support and everything you've been doing because without you, we would not be here.
[52:58.520 --> 53:03.520]  And we're all facing the same globalist onslaught. We're all dealing with the same globalist operations.
[53:03.520 --> 53:15.520]  We're all facing down the barrel of that and without coming together and without supporting each other and without really focusing on the fact that we're under attack, we have no future.
[53:15.520 --> 53:24.520]  Humanity all has red blood. We all have one destiny if we choose it to live together in peace and experience amazing secrets of the universe.
[53:24.520 --> 53:29.520]  And Trump's great crime is he's bringing people together. The globalist want to break the country.
[53:29.520 --> 53:34.520]  He first said we have a country, we have a nation and it's great. And here's what made it great and let's come together.
[53:34.520 --> 53:39.520]  And they can't stand that because they want us alone and divided and pathetic and scared.
[53:39.520 --> 53:45.520]  And it's not just us reverse engineering their operations against us.
[53:45.520 --> 53:53.520]  We don't just have the WikiLeaks. We don't just have all these internal documents and statements and Gruber on TV saying, thank God you're so stupid.
[53:53.520 --> 54:03.520]  We have Sean Parker, former head of Facebook. We have the Facebook documents that got leaked by high level executives.
[54:03.520 --> 54:15.520]  They say there's no more than 10 executives and maybe 20 or 30 assistants that had access to the Facebook plan that got released earlier this year and got almost no attention.
[54:15.520 --> 54:23.520]  It was in the Australian newspapers because it got leaked in Australia and it said we keep them desperate. We keep our people poor. We want to keep them alone.
[54:23.520 --> 54:30.520]  We want to make them impressed and we want to make them liberal so that they don't have a family.
[54:30.520 --> 54:42.520]  I mean that is so diabolical. They exploit your vulnerability. They try to make you more vulnerable and then they get up on TV and they admit it.
[54:42.520 --> 54:53.520]  Why did Parker do that? Is he a good guy? I don't know.
[54:53.520 --> 55:03.520]  It's just crazy. But we're on an express elevator to hell. And I don't say to be negative. I'm an incredibly positive person.
[55:03.520 --> 55:14.520]  Positive in that we can change things and fix things. But I use the analogy of if you're drinking a bottle of vodka a day and your liver's starting to go out, the doctor says, hey, you don't stop. Your liver's going to fail.
[55:14.520 --> 55:22.520]  And we're not going to give alcoholics a new liver. You're going to die. You understand?
[55:22.520 --> 55:29.520]  And people look at the doctor and they say you're just being a killjoy. You're just a punk. You're a fair monger. And you're later, they're in the ground.
[55:29.520 --> 55:47.520]  I had several friends. Hell, I've had more than that. Now that I'm this old, I just lost more family than liver failure, cousin, pretty young. Same age as me.
[55:47.520 --> 55:59.520]  And it's a serious issue. And it's a good allegory. It's a good parallel. It's a good example of the New World Order is run by really selfish, cold-blooded people.
[55:59.520 --> 56:06.520]  And they think you deserve to be annihilated and destroyed and overtaken because you're not wise to this.
[56:06.520 --> 56:17.520]  I mean, I'm telling you, decades before they want you to know what their plans are because they're so arrogant, they write white papers and they have events.
[56:17.520 --> 56:25.520]  And 20-something years ago, I'd have to dig around to find this and found it shocking. Look, Ted Turner says kill 90% of the public and dump everybody down and cut off the resources.
[56:25.520 --> 56:37.520]  And Ted, you know, in an autobahn society court earlier, he'd said in a club of Rome deal that only went out to members. And I'd have to go to the UT law department and ask permission to get it.
[56:37.520 --> 56:45.520]  Because I'd read about it in the book and want to know if it was true. And I'd go down and like, here was the proof like in a movie. I'd get chills at my back how they're planning to kill everybody and how they're going to dump us down.
[56:45.520 --> 56:54.520]  And I'd look around and I'd see the plan being implemented. Now, this is real. And then I started warning people and they said, this guy's crazy.
[56:54.520 --> 57:03.520]  I mean, you know, 19, 20 years ago, I'd read about human animal chimeras. I didn't want to believe it, but it was in major elite publications.
[57:03.520 --> 57:18.520]  By elite, it just means to them where they communicate with each other. They just talk about all this stuff like they talk about you like you have less value than a grain of salt.
[57:18.520 --> 57:26.520]  And they just talk all about it. How once they get the computer grid in place to control everybody, then they're going to kill everybody.
[57:26.520 --> 57:32.520]  But right now there'd be a war you'd resist. You'd fight back. They'd never win a war right now. The globalists would end up blowing back on them.
[57:32.520 --> 57:43.520]  They've got to get you so drugged out, so whacked out, so confused with robot sentries and computer grids everywhere, so that when they flip the switch, they've got autonomous robot armies to help them carry out the main wife out.
[57:43.520 --> 57:55.520]  So again, each comment and just remember, I am very proud to announce the introduction of the highest quality info wars, biome defense probiotic.
[57:55.520 --> 58:08.520]  We wanted to come out with the largest spectrum of high quality known probiotics that have been proven to improve overall digestion and health and detoxification in the body.

[59:49.520 --> 59:57.520]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[59:57.520 --> 01:00:07.520]  Well here we are ladies and gentlemen, Thanksgiving. One of the few true American holidays that we've got, probably my favorite holiday.
[01:00:07.520 --> 01:00:16.520]  The 23rd day of November 2017. We've seen total demonization of the Italian Christopher Columbus.
[01:00:16.520 --> 01:00:32.520]  We've seen the total demonization of Thanksgiving. We've seen attempts to get rid of the holiday, to use it to cast aspersions on western civilization and western expansion that undoubtedly was a mess.
[01:00:32.520 --> 01:00:43.520]  And there were crimes on all sides. When I say all sides, it wasn't just the settlers, or it wasn't just the troops, or it wasn't just the empires, or it wasn't just all the different native tribes.
[01:00:43.520 --> 01:01:03.520]  It was all of those different countless changing factions that played into this. Long before white men were colonized, North America, the Vikings certainly visited it for a thousand years before Christopher Columbus supposedly discovered it, that's now documented.
[01:01:03.520 --> 01:01:19.520]  But long before white men ever colonized it, all the native tribes did, was running around and trying to dominate and control each other, and take over, and kill the men, and then take the women and the children.
[01:01:19.520 --> 01:01:29.520]  The same stuff that was going on in Europe for 10,000 years, the same stuff going on in Africa for 10,000 years, the same stuff going on everywhere in the world.
[01:01:29.520 --> 01:01:44.520]  Humans acted the same, and so we never see big pieces being done on the bad things that the Native Americans did, or the way they behaved, because it's not part of the liberation theology.
[01:01:44.520 --> 01:01:59.520]  Starting in the 50s, the Ford Foundation, the Carnegie Endowment, created liberation theology where they thought Jesus would have fought back, and was a revolutionary, and hated capitalism, and was a communist.
[01:01:59.520 --> 01:02:08.520]  So they got the different populations that were Christian, poor, black, Hispanic, you name it, to become liberation theologians.
[01:02:08.520 --> 01:02:28.520]  And that was just one part of it, but to teach that in the schools to everybody that America was bad, the founders were bad, this was an undermining of the nation state, and our ethos, where we came from, so that people of color particularly wouldn't have an idea in their head that they had a right to the American birthright,
[01:02:28.520 --> 01:02:38.520]  or that they'd been part, critical parts of this great saga. No, it's all just you were good, but you were exploited, and the whites were bad.
[01:02:38.520 --> 01:02:49.520]  When it was way more complex, with whites that were religious servants, and bounties, and people basically as slaves, and company stores, and sharecroppers,
[01:02:49.520 --> 01:02:58.520]  but they just continued to play on the incredible ignorance of the public. The last few weeks CNN claims they've broken the news that there's slave auctions in Libya.
[01:02:58.520 --> 01:03:10.520]  Broken the news? In seven different Muslim countries, they sell women on top slave blocks, you know, up on a stage, and it's all known, it's Muslims doing it.
[01:03:10.520 --> 01:03:19.520]  But all these reports from CNN breaking, you know, this supposed news that we've been talking about forever, and others have been documenting.
[01:03:19.520 --> 01:03:30.520]  It's about, oh, the poor migrants, the poor babies, the poor migrants, these are people in Africa that are being kidnapped, and grabbed, and sold into slavery by Muslims,
[01:03:30.520 --> 01:03:38.520]  but somehow they turn it into, quote, Muslims, by using the term migrant, that's the new definition of Muslims is a migrant, never a Muslim invader.
[01:03:38.520 --> 01:03:46.520]  So they take Muslims, enslaving people, and then turn it into the catch-all word of poor little Muslims, which is migrant.
[01:03:46.520 --> 01:03:52.520]  So they know what they're doing, ladies and gentlemen, but we're going to be covering that a lot more here during the transmission,
[01:03:52.520 --> 01:03:58.520]  but I'm proud of Thanksgiving, and I give thanks to you, the audience, thanks to God, thanks to my family, thanks to the great crew,
[01:03:58.520 --> 01:04:01.520]  and I just want to thank you all for what you've done.

[01:06:20.520 --> 01:06:25.520]  I'm Alex Jones, your host. We're now an hour into this worldwide broadcast.
[01:06:25.520 --> 01:06:35.520]  And joining us is a true visionary, best-selling author, researcher, scientist, Dr. Michael Savage.
[01:06:35.520 --> 01:06:41.520]  He's written many number one New York Times best-selling books, but he's got the newest one I can't wait to read.
[01:06:41.520 --> 01:06:53.520]  God, Faith and Reason. I think we should start first with the book and the time we have him with us, then we'll get into Russia Gates and the calls for martial law, the calls for killing the president.
[01:06:53.520 --> 01:07:01.520]  Sweden is pushing to change their flag to an Islamic flag, saying that we started the crusades and we're bad despite the fact that it's the opposite.
[01:07:01.520 --> 01:07:09.520]  He was the first person I ever heard like 15 years ago say that liberalism was a mental disorder.
[01:07:09.520 --> 01:07:18.520]  And I got that some were clearly mentally ill, but now with Trump Derangement Syndrome, it's a mass psychology of mass mental illness and it's getting worse.
[01:07:18.520 --> 01:07:23.520]  And the most radical ones are adding to the hysteria. It's like telling a schizophrenic, oh, it is true.
[01:07:23.520 --> 01:07:27.520]  There are men in the walls coming to eat you. That'll make them go jump off the cliff.
[01:07:27.520 --> 01:07:31.520]  So now the media has told them, yes, Nazis are everywhere. Yes, everything's horrible.
[01:07:31.520 --> 01:07:38.520]  Even though the economy is getting better and all these good things are happening, they are literally going insane and assaulting Dr. Savage.
[01:07:38.520 --> 01:07:43.520]  Dr. Savage, myself, women wearing Make America Great Again hats are being beaten up on the street.
[01:07:43.520 --> 01:07:51.520]  Michael Savage, you told us what was coming. So tell us the next level. What's coming next?
[01:07:51.520 --> 01:07:57.520]  Look, I wrote Godfrey the reason, but it doesn't mean that I can talk to God. I've been looking for him all my life, you know.
[01:07:57.520 --> 01:08:02.520]  What's coming next is just finish the narrative of where the insane go.
[01:08:02.520 --> 01:08:08.520]  When the insane take over the asylum, what do they do? They kill everyone in sight and they start eating each other.
[01:08:08.520 --> 01:08:16.520]  They eat each other. They become cannibals. I predict cannibalism is on the horizon, which will be sold as a wholesome alternative to veganism.
[01:08:16.520 --> 01:08:22.520]  In other words, you go all the way down the line of no living creatures, but now eat people because that's the natural way.
[01:08:22.520 --> 01:08:30.520]  After all, that's the way it was done in the South Pacific until the missionaries came along and told the savages, it's not OK to eat your daughter's nose, which they did.
[01:08:30.520 --> 01:08:38.520]  I spent many years in the South Pacific. The last piece of human flesh that was known to have been eaten in the Fiji Allens was in 1939 in front of a missionary.
[01:08:38.520 --> 01:08:46.520]  When they took a young girl, you talk about molestation, they took one of the young girls from the servant class, actually the slave class in their village,
[01:08:46.520 --> 01:08:53.520]  and they cut her nose off and threw it on the fire to roast it for the missionary, and he respectfully declined. Yes, that's right.
[01:08:53.520 --> 01:09:03.520]  Missionaries saved them from cannibalism, never given credit for that, because the psychotics must go through hell in order to be saved, and that's where they're going.
[01:09:03.520 --> 01:09:09.520]  But they're not taking me with them. I'll tell you right now, Alex, they're not taking you with them. They're not taking your audience with them.
[01:09:09.520 --> 01:09:15.520]  All I can say is if they want to go there, good luck to them, but don't try to take us because we ain't going with you.
[01:09:15.520 --> 01:09:23.520]  And what you're saying is dead on, because I remember listening about two years ago, you said they're going to eat their own, the next level of psychotic behavior is cannibalism,
[01:09:23.520 --> 01:09:32.520]  inmates literally killing the wardens and then finally killing themselves, and they're already politically doing it with Donna Brazil coming out,
[01:09:32.520 --> 01:09:42.520]  and Wolf Blitzer and even Rachel Maddow's brother over there, Hayes or whatever his name is, they're all turning against the Clintons right now.
[01:09:42.520 --> 01:09:46.520]  What do you make of this?
[01:09:46.520 --> 01:09:54.520]  It's a game, it's a shell game. They know she's unelectable, so they figure get rid of her and get someone even more psychotic than she is,
[01:09:54.520 --> 01:10:01.520]  someone more power mad than she is, someone more to the left if you want to put it in common parlance than she is.
[01:10:01.520 --> 01:10:06.520]  She's yesterday's news, she lost the election, she's burned her, her path is over.
[01:10:06.520 --> 01:10:12.520]  So they figure, you know, Burner, what do they got to lose this way they can make believe they're fair. And what is worse than Hillary Clinton?
[01:10:12.520 --> 01:10:22.520]  Hillary Clinton is power mad, but in a strange way, she's a centrist power mad person, leavened by her husband, by the way, who's far less crazy than she is.
[01:10:22.520 --> 01:10:28.520]  I don't think you've heard anyone say that. Bill Clinton would be less of a danger to the country than Hillary is.
[01:10:28.520 --> 01:10:38.520]  But they're yesterday's news, they're old and not progressive enough, you know, Alex, you got to get someone who's half lizard, half human,
[01:10:38.520 --> 01:10:45.520]  and wholly insane in order to run for office and have a match of red cow, you know, supporter.
[01:10:45.520 --> 01:10:52.520]  Wolf Blitzer, I don't know what did it to him, nice Jewish boy from Israel, comes to America, makes a fortune, and then hates the country.
[01:10:52.520 --> 01:10:59.520]  What did it? My guess is all the carbon dioxide from all the seltzer in Brooklyn. That's what I think it counts for most of the liberalism.
[01:10:59.520 --> 01:11:08.520]  I mean, they say carbon dioxide as a threat, they're obsessed with carbon dioxide without even knowing that without carbon dioxide, there wouldn't be any plant life without plant life, we'd all be dead.
[01:11:08.520 --> 01:11:19.520]  And of course, what's interesting is that during the period when we had higher levels of carbon dioxide, I'm talking eons ago, there was more plant life, which allowed more animal life to grow.
[01:11:19.520 --> 01:11:29.520]  Having said all of that, all the years in New York City that the seltzer men were around selling these bottles of seltzer on trucks, it was a very popular beverage.
[01:11:29.520 --> 01:11:37.520]  Well, I think that the little bubbles of carbon dioxide in the seltzer water somehow crossed the blood-brain barrier and destroyed an entire generation that's now running the media.
[01:11:37.520 --> 01:11:42.520]  I can name them all. Wolf Blitzer seltzer, carbon dioxide toxic poisoning.
[01:11:42.520 --> 01:11:58.520]  Shall I name all of those who must have been OD'd on seltzer as children as they sat around the tables discussing Karl Marx and Engels for breakfast and then was sent to camps in the Poconos, the red diaper doper baby camps, where they could go to communist camps and sing the communist intonationale.
[01:11:58.520 --> 01:12:05.520]  If you think I'm making this up, people don't know anything about the history of the New York liberal. I know everything about it because I ran from them.
[01:12:05.520 --> 01:12:22.520]  Well, absolutely. There's a lot of folks that actually went through that that will tell you like Joseph Farah, your friend from WorldNet Daily. He was a young Lebanese American, but his parents were communists in New York and they literally sent him to communist camp and were literally training him to be a weather underground person.
[01:12:22.520 --> 01:12:36.520]  Well, I was never trained to be a weather underground person. I was trained just to get out there and not get stepped on by life. And you know, here I am, you know, Alex, it'll be 24 years this March that I'm in radio.
[01:12:36.520 --> 01:12:46.520]  It was purely as a result of praying to God to open up the Red Sea for me that this happened. But I've told my listeners that I'm going to tell them again today and I'd like to mention it to your great audience.
[01:12:46.520 --> 01:12:57.520]  Okay, what's this with a God book, Savage? Would you suddenly find religion? It's not that I found religion. I've been searching for, I've been looking for God ever since I've been a little boy.
[01:12:57.520 --> 01:13:08.520]  Whether it was the little boy story that I tell boy in the papers in the street, four-year-old kid, Bronx, Longfellow Avenue, a Jewish newspaper is blowing up the street.
[01:13:08.520 --> 01:13:18.520]  I thought it was a holy book. I didn't even understand the language, but I thought it was a holy book. I ran after these sheets of paper in the street, bundled them up in the wind. It's a true story.
[01:13:18.520 --> 01:13:28.520]  Brought home this whole bundle of paper. Mom, look what I found. Look what I found. I saved this and she laughed and she patted me on the head. She said, it's okay, Michael, it's just a newspaper.
[01:13:28.520 --> 01:13:41.520]  So I've been looking for evidence, the evidence, the evidence, the evidence, and all I've found are glimpses. And here's my most important point. It's my Einsteinian moment, Alex. I discovered it in writing this book.
[01:13:41.520 --> 01:13:52.520]  Why is God invisible to us? Why are we not idol worshipers? Why are we not worshiping period blood and chicken feathers, as so many of the immigrants seem to do in basements?
[01:13:52.520 --> 01:14:03.520]  You know, with chickens and vultures and God knows what. You drive around in San Francisco. They used to be in New York on the cars, a little St. Christopher Medal on the dashboard, right?
[01:14:03.520 --> 01:14:12.520]  I figured they're nice Catholic people. You drive around in San Francisco. They can't even see through the windshield. Dream catchers, pillows, voodoo dolls.
[01:14:12.520 --> 01:14:26.520]  This is the meltdown of the United States of America. Once we lost our connection to the roots of America, which was deeply rooted in monotheism, in one God, once we lost that, we started to lose America.
[01:14:26.520 --> 01:14:37.520]  And it all started with Allen Ginsberg, Timothy Leary, and William Kunstler, the three most evil people in the history of this country, who took this country from where it was to where it is.
[01:14:37.520 --> 01:14:46.520]  And we've only begun on this insane road, Alex. You know it, and I know it. You live it every day. So what are we on the other side of reality supposed to do? Put up with it?
[01:14:46.520 --> 01:14:56.520]  Well, we do, but we got to resist the resistors because we are the true resistance. They're garbage. They're nothing. They're insane. They'll go away like you blow them down in the wind.
[01:14:56.520 --> 01:14:58.520]  And historically, when I come back and talk about...
[01:14:58.520 --> 01:15:10.520]  I'm not to fear them. They're nothing. They're garbage. And I want to know why the Hell's Angels haven't come out, the plumbers haven't come out with pipes, the electricians haven't come out with wire, and said, cross this line.
[01:15:10.520 --> 01:15:19.520]  That's it. You know, back in the 60s, during the anti-war demonstrations, in New York, the head of the Plumbers Union said, enough is enough with these scumbags.
[01:15:19.520 --> 01:15:27.520]  And he called out the plumbers to come out to the next hippie march. Let me tell you something. The hippies never marched again where the plumbers were.
[01:15:27.520 --> 01:15:32.520]  And that's what has to happen. There has to be a line in this country. It's enough of these insane crybabies.
[01:15:32.520 --> 01:15:40.520]  All right. Michael Savage is on fire today. So we're going to come back and get more into the book because he's absolutely right. He called it his Einsteinian moment.
[01:15:40.520 --> 01:15:53.520]  It's true. Once you have a just basic good God out of your life, you disintegrate into human sacrifice, idiocy. The mass mental craziness is intensifying. We'll cover it on the other side.
[01:15:53.520 --> 01:16:02.520]  Water is the single most important thing your body needs. So you want to be sure it's the best for you and your family.

[01:19:58.520 --> 01:20:08.520]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:20:08.520 --> 01:20:28.520]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[01:20:28.520 --> 01:20:39.520]  I'm not going to be talking much because savage rarely gets wound up here on the air and a lot of times when he does, he gets so angry he's got to go off the air.
[01:20:39.520 --> 01:20:44.520]  I'm going to try to just let him flow because he's in rare form today and I love it as long as he'll stay with us this hour or much of this hour.
[01:20:44.520 --> 01:20:49.520]  He's got the new book out that I can't wait to read God's Faith and Reason, Michael Savage.
[01:20:49.520 --> 01:21:11.520]  I think that Michael Savage was looking for God like Carl Jung was seeing in archetypes meant that he had God's stamp on him. People that are looking to destroy God and overturn goodness and overturn decency and who say there isn't a God and who are saying that basically they're God or they're going to destroy God or they're going to worship human sacrifice or they're going to worship ugliness.
[01:21:11.520 --> 01:21:29.520]  I love their father, the devil. I don't care what religion or culture you come from. When you look at globalism, the leftists, the Soviets, the Nazis, always authoritarian systems, they had a bloodlust to run everybody else's lives, to control language and basically had a mass psychology and a will to kill.
[01:21:29.520 --> 01:21:41.520]  And that's what Michael Savage was starting to get into and now we see the left going, yeah, we want guns. We're going to kill you and we're communist and we hate you and we're going to bring in radical Islamics and we're going to let them promote slavery in their own countries.
[01:21:41.520 --> 01:21:55.520]  We're going to have Muslim women who are hardcore Islamists like Linda Sorcerer, lead women's marches. We now learn what it's really all about as the gloves come off, the mask comes off and we're face to face with 21st century evil.
[01:21:55.520 --> 01:22:10.520]  Michael Savage, you were on fire last segment. I'm showing footage of Mall of America from two days ago on our TV feed where a Somali man stabbed another two people screaming Allah Akbar and now many areas of the country look like Somalia.
[01:22:10.520 --> 01:22:12.520]  Please continue.
[01:22:12.520 --> 01:22:25.520]  Well, on my website, I put up Somali Muslim stabs. They didn't report that. They said it was a burglary gone wrong. I never saw such propaganda in my life. Trump calls it fake news. This is not fake news. This is beyond Goebbels what we're seeing.
[01:22:25.520 --> 01:22:35.520]  I have never thought I'd live through a time when you look at people in the media, they look normal. They look like they want to live. They don't look suicidal.
[01:22:35.520 --> 01:22:46.520]  You know, ordinary men, women of all races, they're insane. They're suicidal. They're digging their children's graves. What is it going to take for them to understand that they are the problem?
[01:22:46.520 --> 01:23:00.520]  They're the gatekeepers of information. We're marginal. You have a small show that's large in reach and power. I have a show that's small and away but very large in reach and power.
[01:23:00.520 --> 01:23:06.520]  Alex, can we save the country from these insane bastards before it's too late?
[01:23:06.520 --> 01:23:13.520]  Well, this is different than other countries. We're not disarmed. We haven't been disarmed.
[01:23:13.520 --> 01:23:23.520]  And let me tell you something. There are tens of thousands of retired military, retired cops and unretired military and unretired cops. No one's stepping on them.
[01:23:23.520 --> 01:23:39.520]  It's just not going to be as easy as it was in 1917 in Russia where the guns had been seized. It's certainly not going to be as easy as the knocking on the door in Germany, Poland, Hungary and the other places where the Jews and others had been disarmed.
[01:23:39.520 --> 01:23:47.520]  And is that why they're so upset is because our ancestors laid down provisions for just their type of scum?
[01:23:47.520 --> 01:23:53.520]  I don't know who would talk about we say they who's the head of this? I mean, who are the leftist mentally ill devil?
[01:23:53.520 --> 01:24:00.520]  How many are there? How many? Wait, how many are there of these boogeymen? Who are they? Who are they? Who's actually?
[01:24:00.520 --> 01:24:12.520]  They're the SJWs. They're the mainstream media. They're it's the Hollywood crowd. It's the big mega banks. It's all the elites that want to it's people like Jeff Bezos who gets all this taxpayer money and all these monopolies.
[01:24:12.520 --> 01:24:19.520]  And then he's literally working with the Washington Post to try to shut me and Matt Drudge and others down and calling us all Russian agents.
[01:24:19.520 --> 01:24:29.520]  Yeah, I saw that's crazy about Drudge. I mean, it's unbelievable. I mean, this guy is sends more traffic to the Washington Post than anyone else and they attack him to show you how insane they really are.
[01:24:29.520 --> 01:24:36.520]  But let's forget Bezos for one minute. We say the enemy, the enemy, they want to get us. You touched on an important point.
[01:24:36.520 --> 01:24:46.520]  Okay, God, the way we know God, Christians or Jews in this country gives us free will. We're the ultimately ultimately the most free people on earth.
[01:24:46.520 --> 01:24:54.520]  If we actually believe in God, we come to understand we have free will. He gave us life, but we have free will to act out our lives.
[01:24:54.520 --> 01:25:02.520]  The opposite are the statists or the central governmentists. If you want to call them all of these other demons, they say, No, you have no free will.
[01:25:02.520 --> 01:25:12.520]  We are your will. We are your will. We are the Hitler's. We are the Stalin's. We are the Mussolini's. We are the Pol Potts. We tell you what shall be.
[01:25:12.520 --> 01:25:25.520]  We are your will. You have no freedom. You're just a moat in the mire. A moat in the mire. You're nothing. And that is the greatest threat to these globalists, which is free will individualism, if you want to call it that.
[01:25:25.520 --> 01:25:34.520]  So I, as a tremendously independent individual, and no one, I never liked anyone telling me what to do. It's just a part of my nature.
[01:25:34.520 --> 01:25:42.520]  It doesn't mean I'm a tough guy. I'm not. I'm not bulletproof. I'm just resistant to people telling me what to do. You're not taking it lying down.
[01:25:42.520 --> 01:25:49.520]  Whether it was a teacher saying to me when I was young, you're not a gentleman. I used to hear that all the time. I didn't want to be a gentleman.
[01:25:49.520 --> 01:25:56.520]  What do you mean you're not a gentleman? What does that mean? Remember how they train kids? You're not a gentleman. What do you want me to do?
[01:25:56.520 --> 01:26:06.520]  What do you want to step on me and put on a skirt? You want to turn me into like a trans whatever? I mean, get off my back. Don't tell me what to do. I'll tell you what to do.
[01:26:06.520 --> 01:26:14.520]  So now we're facing this thing with God. Let's go back to God. The E equals MC squared moment. I didn't even explain this most important thing.
[01:26:14.520 --> 01:26:21.520]  Okay, so all my life I looked for God. I can't find him. I'm saying, where's God? Where's God? I can't see him. The Buddhists worship a statue, right?
[01:26:21.520 --> 01:26:31.520]  In essence, they're idol worshipers. I love their poetry, but basically you're worshiping an idol. All of these Catholics who left Catholicism to fake Buddhism, you know, with the hands in the restaurants like,
[01:26:31.520 --> 01:26:38.520]  thank you for the water and they thank the way to 50 times for a napkin. They don't even know what Buddhism is. That's not Buddhism.
[01:26:38.520 --> 01:26:47.520]  The fallen American religious person who becomes a Buddhist, they don't even know what Buddhism is. Okay, so now we come to us. We can't find God.
[01:26:47.520 --> 01:26:54.520]  We can't see God. We can't touch God. Why? Aha, the moment God doesn't want us to see him feeling and touch him. Why?
[01:26:54.520 --> 01:27:01.520]  Because in searching for him everywhere, that's the finding. In searching, we find that's the success.
[01:27:01.520 --> 01:27:10.520]  By the way, I hadn't read your book, but you notice I just said that. The fact that you were seeking as a child showed, I mean, that's the proof right there.
[01:27:10.520 --> 01:27:20.520]  Well, I always was looking for his presence, whether it was the newspaper blowing down the street or looking at cloud formations or studying the stars, or, you know, I became a biologist for a reason,
[01:27:20.520 --> 01:27:35.520]  which was to, you know, when I first saw the bones of a bird in anatomy, and I said, oh my God, look how God or the grand designer created the birds of a, the bones of a bird are hollow.
[01:27:35.520 --> 01:27:46.520]  Why are they hollow so the bird can fly? The bones are lighter than ours, right? The mammalian bones are not hollow. The bird's bones have holes in them, in essence.
[01:27:46.520 --> 01:27:57.520]  This is so genius, right? And then you look at the bird's wing, fold it up and you unfold it, and you see an anatomical, anatomical similarities to our hands.
[01:27:57.520 --> 01:28:04.520]  And you say there has to be a grand design. Then you study Einstein, you know, the kids in college have the picture of him with the crazier with the tongue out.
[01:28:04.520 --> 01:28:17.520]  That wasn't Einstein. Einstein, as the man who went to the perimeters of the universe and came back and said, the more I study the outreaches of the universe, the more I have to, the more I understand there has to be a God.
[01:28:17.520 --> 01:28:23.520]  That's what Einstein actually said in his later years. He wasn't as great atheistic hippie.
[01:28:23.520 --> 01:28:34.520]  And that's the left triumph is they take icons and turn them towards their service. Let's come back and talk about your Einstein moment straight ahead with Michael Savage, the new book, God, Faith and Reason.
[01:28:34.520 --> 01:28:41.520]  This is something you want to read and share with people. I'm Alex Jones, infowars.com. Michael's got a dog in his lap. We're going to come back.
[01:28:41.520 --> 01:28:50.520]  Well, that's my mascot. And by the way, he's real because I feel he's real, just like your trans people. Is he real?
[01:28:50.520 --> 01:28:55.520]  Do you identify as a walrus? Maybe I do. He looks like he looks really sounds real.
[01:28:55.520 --> 01:29:06.520]  The answer to being in control of your own health care is freedom from insurance. Become part of a group of self-pay patients that come together to share in each other's medical expenses.
[01:29:06.520 --> 01:29:13.520]  Individual share amounts begin at $107 a month and $347 for families. Choose from three health sharing programs.
[01:29:13.520 --> 01:29:25.520]  Holistic treatments may be eligible for sharing. See guidelines. Discount programs available for dental, vision and pharmacy. Go to libertyoncall.org. That's libertyoncall.org.
[01:29:25.520 --> 01:29:34.520]  It's a no brainer. A Big Berkey water filter is the one you need, period. You need a water filter that removes chlorine, fluoride, pharmaceuticals, BPA and other endocrine disruptors.
[01:29:34.520 --> 01:29:43.520]  Pesticides, bacteria, viruses and much more, right? And does it all at only two cents per gallon. Get the original, most trusted name in gravity water filtration, Big Berkey.
[01:29:43.520 --> 01:29:56.520]  And now GCN listeners receive 5% off ceramic filter systems using code GCN. Call or click 1-877-99 Berkey or bigberkeywaterfilters.com. That's 1-877-99-B-E-R-K-E-Y.
[01:29:56.520 --> 01:30:01.520]  Not a group you develop living depends for us. It took you over a year to do it. Why is this so good?
[01:30:01.520 --> 01:30:12.520]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most. I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in my system.
[01:30:12.520 --> 01:30:20.520]  But right now we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism.
[01:30:20.520 --> 01:30:28.520]  Right now with all the refugees spreading disease around, we have biological warfare going on everywhere. These are all parasites.
[01:30:28.520 --> 01:30:30.520]  Tell us about all the stuff I said. There's so many things that are in it.
[01:30:30.520 --> 01:30:38.520]  You have the neem in there, you have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood. I recommend doing the parasite plans at least twice a year.
[01:30:38.520 --> 01:30:44.520]  Alright, well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today. It just came back in yesterday. Living Defense, infowarslife.com.
[01:30:44.520 --> 01:30:51.520]  And folks, you can't lose full of stuff that's great for your body, period. And you support the broadcast, infowarslife.com.
[01:30:51.520 --> 01:30:56.520]  Thank you, Dr. Group, from the Global Healing Center. Thank you so much for all your work, sir, on this great product.
[01:30:56.520 --> 01:31:07.520]  America is an information-based civil war. That's why now, more than ever, we've got to hit the streets of America and let these globalists scum know we're not backing down from their bullying.
[01:31:07.520 --> 01:31:13.520]  We're only intensifying our operations in the face of their wannabe dictatorship.
[01:31:13.520 --> 01:31:21.520]  Being a conservative, a nationalist, a libertarian, or simply a free speech advocate is truly the counterculture.
[01:31:21.520 --> 01:31:29.520]  The real punk rock is being a patriot who's pro-America, pro-capitalism, and pro-freedom, who at the same time is tolerant.
[01:31:29.520 --> 01:31:37.520]  Modern liberalism is a counterfeit of Thomas Jefferson's classical liberalism. They are the anti-liberalists.
[01:31:37.520 --> 01:31:41.520]  To defend free speech, meet like-minded friends, and promote freedom worldwide.
[01:31:41.520 --> 01:31:51.520]  We've got more than 60 original designs of high-quality t-shirts for men and women, as well as more Patriot Feral at infowarsstore.com.
[01:31:51.520 --> 01:31:56.520]  Be part of the Second American Revolution at infowarsstore.com.
[01:31:56.520 --> 01:32:12.520]  I know I don't have to remind most of you of the fact that culturally, societally, economically, spiritually, militarily, the planet's sitting on top of a giant time bomb.
[01:32:12.520 --> 01:32:20.520]  Things are getting crazy. We're trying to fix the country and fix the planet. We've also got to have rearguard actions to be prepared.
[01:32:20.520 --> 01:32:27.520]  The number one thing after getting right with God is to have high-quality, durable food. Well, the entire line of my Patriot supply foods,
[01:32:27.520 --> 01:32:34.520]  private-labeled as infowarsselect, is now 50% off. We've only done that one time before previously.
[01:32:34.520 --> 01:32:39.520]  50% off. You cannot beat that. And we're only doing that through Cyber Monday.
[01:32:39.520 --> 01:32:43.520]  So it starts today on Thanksgiving and runs through next Monday.
[01:32:43.520 --> 01:32:50.520]  You can go to infowarsstore.com. You can go right there. It's the full spectrum of my Patriot. It's private-labeled by us. Totally fresh.
[01:32:50.520 --> 01:33:15.520]  Last 25 years, 50% off. 50% off. Take action today.
[01:33:21.520 --> 01:33:27.520]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the Resistance.
[01:33:27.520 --> 01:33:33.520]  Live from the infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:33.520 --> 01:33:41.520]  And Michael Savage, what a treat. God, faith and reason. Michael Savage, number one New York Times best selling author. I cannot wait to read this book.
[01:33:41.520 --> 01:33:44.520]  In fact, once the kids go to bed tonight, I'm going to start getting into it.
[01:33:44.520 --> 01:33:52.520]  Then I'll have two in the morning reading the whole thing. I will get it read by this weekend because the more I burrow into the mental illness of the left,
[01:33:52.520 --> 01:33:56.520]  there are a bunch of people that want to be alphas, but they don't want the responsibility.
[01:33:56.520 --> 01:34:04.520]  And they're not real intellectuals. They want to say they're the intellectuals, then create an authoritarian system where all thought has to be approved by them.
[01:34:04.520 --> 01:34:14.520]  That's called a cult. And they are waging war with any stable civilization because they want to conquer it instead of joining with it.
[01:34:14.520 --> 01:34:19.520]  It's just a bunch of betas getting together and trying to be alphas, is my view.
[01:34:19.520 --> 01:34:22.520]  And Michael Savage, if he'd just joined us, was getting into...
[01:34:22.520 --> 01:34:30.520]  I like the Brave New World analogy. Alpha, beta, gamma, delta. I think they're more like deltas. You look at guys like Wolf Flitzer.
[01:34:30.520 --> 01:34:35.520]  Do you actually think he's even a beta? These people are fakers. There's nothing there.
[01:34:35.520 --> 01:34:40.520]  There's no education. There's no knowledge. There's no history. Or you bring others up.
[01:34:40.520 --> 01:34:44.520]  Well, what have they actually achieved? Who are they? What have they written that anyone will remember?
[01:34:44.520 --> 01:34:49.520]  Alex, I have to interject right now because I believe my book today, this one is my most important book.
[01:34:49.520 --> 01:34:54.520]  I think it's the definitive book I've written that could lead America back to the standards we hold in esteem.
[01:34:54.520 --> 01:35:00.520]  It may sound too megalomaniacal for most people, but you know what? So what? I've got to say it. If I won't, who will?
[01:35:00.520 --> 01:35:03.520]  If I'm not for myself, who will be? If I'm only for myself, who am I?
[01:35:03.520 --> 01:35:11.520]  But it's no brag, just fact. If not for people like you and a few others, Matt Drudge, Donald Trump, let's say it myself and a few others.
[01:35:11.520 --> 01:35:17.520]  If we weren't here, we would have lost. So we have to admit we are the resistance. Our audience is really the key.
[01:35:17.520 --> 01:35:21.520]  And so it's true. We would be totally defeated if it wasn't for us.
[01:35:21.520 --> 01:35:27.520]  And that means our audience, we're not taking credit. We're saying we've got the munitions that will blow the enemy up.
[01:35:27.520 --> 01:35:33.520]  We'd be out of business. Alex, I want to do something for you and your audience, which is this.
[01:35:33.520 --> 01:35:40.520]  You know, there's a lot of books. There's a lot of hackney writing. This is my Magnus Opus. It's based on my entire life quest.
[01:35:40.520 --> 01:35:42.520]  Can I read you a half of a page?
[01:35:42.520 --> 01:35:45.520]  Hey, please take over. Please do the next segment. You've got the floor. Go ahead.
[01:35:45.520 --> 01:35:55.520]  I was at a funeral for a friend, a friend's father. And I had told a friend of mine who was an American, you know, a World War Two hero.
[01:35:55.520 --> 01:36:01.520]  It was a bit of a Nazi. I loved him anyway. We were friends. We argue all the time, but we had a mutual respect for each other.
[01:36:01.520 --> 01:36:11.520]  And we fight, argue, whatever. So my friend's father dies. Henry had survived Auschwitz. They cut three of his hands, fingers off in a saw.
[01:36:11.520 --> 01:36:22.520]  He was an extremely bitter man. So he dies. And so I go to the funeral and my friend, the Nazi kind of Nazi sympathies was Bob.
[01:36:22.520 --> 01:36:27.520]  So I'm going to read from there. It's a half a page. So Bob shut his mouth that night many years ago.
[01:36:27.520 --> 01:36:36.520]  And as I've said, he tends to harbor certain Nazi sentiments. So when I told him about Murray's mutilated hand, I wasn't surprised at his lack of immediate pitting sounds.
[01:36:36.520 --> 01:36:46.520]  But I like a challenge. So I went on. Murray never cried about his hand. I told Bob he came to America with Florence, who he met somewhere over there and had a family, namely Joel.
[01:36:46.520 --> 01:36:54.520]  He was full of life this Murray. He was a big drinker. He loved women. He beat his son with a strap, but he was a big personality. Bob nodded at that.
[01:36:54.520 --> 01:37:01.520]  I think the anti-Semite in him liked the never cried and beat his son parts of Murray. So I proceeded with my funeral story.
[01:37:01.520 --> 01:37:08.520]  I had lost touch with my friend Joel for a few years. His wife threw him out for beating her and at least one of their daughters.
[01:37:08.520 --> 01:37:18.520]  And he was in one of his episodic hideings this time from the sheriff's department. They were after him for his house and all his earnings to give to his greedy wife.
[01:37:18.520 --> 01:37:23.520]  Somehow I heard his father Murray had cancer and was dying. I called his mother and went over a few days later.
[01:37:23.520 --> 01:37:32.520]  We brought over a bag of groceries, you know, French bread, a pound of sliced turkey, some wines and vegetables and a quart of milk. The usual stuff you bring with someone sick, poor at housebound.
[01:37:32.520 --> 01:37:36.520]  Florence and Joel greeted us at the door of their little one bedroom apartment.
[01:37:36.520 --> 01:37:48.520]  I always liked it there, remembering the holidays in my own house when I was a boy. Having been in the antique business like my deceased father Benny, the place was filled with oversized high quality furniture and paintings.
[01:37:48.520 --> 01:37:58.520]  Murray was in a bathroom in a gigantic English armchair, shrunken but beautiful in a way. He pulled me close and said, Michael, Michael, I remember when you took me and and Joel to Berkeley almost 20 years ago.
[01:37:58.520 --> 01:38:07.520]  I know you almost 20 years. That's not a short time. He said, you took me to a bar on Telegraph Avenue. Michael, those were the good times. Now are the bad times.
[01:38:07.520 --> 01:38:15.520]  Bob, I prodded you here. This I extend one good D 20 years ago. And this guy remembers is like one of the best moments of his life. This one drink I bought him.
[01:38:15.520 --> 01:38:23.520]  So he goes fast into the hospital where he insists they let him out probably to die at home and three or four days later, boom, it's over like that.
[01:38:23.520 --> 01:38:32.520]  Joel told me he had been sick most of the night vomiting, probably those toxic chemicals. He forces himself up and says, Joel, she's there on your left, the angel of death.
[01:38:32.520 --> 01:38:39.520]  Joel gets scared. He says, Pop, there's nobody here but me and mom. Murray stares at the big chair across the small room to your right.
[01:38:39.520 --> 01:38:49.520]  Joel on the couch there, there he stands up, starts to walk across the room and collapses. I can see that even the anti semi Bob is tearing up.
[01:38:49.520 --> 01:39:01.520]  Wiping the tears from his face. Listen, you racist bastard. I said to him, looking at that hole in the ground with Murray's caskets out there and hearing the rabbi's ancient chant and watching the young Mexican grave diggers move by that chant.
[01:39:01.520 --> 01:39:11.520]  I became reminded of my own hole waiting. I never knew where I wanted to live. I whispered to Joel's friend from Israeli intelligence and I sure don't know where I want to die.
[01:39:11.520 --> 01:39:25.520]  We never know where we're going to die. He reminded me with a 70s rockers cackle and grin. That's it. I write jazz. See, people think of me in a way that I'm not.
[01:39:25.520 --> 01:39:35.520]  They make me into what I'm not. They categorize you. They categorize me. I'm fundamentally a poet and a writer who's also got some political beliefs.
[01:39:35.520 --> 01:39:44.520]  I'm not a politician who also writes and they want to challenge me on a literary level. If they want to challenge me, let them write something better than that. It's in God, faith and reason.
[01:39:44.520 --> 01:39:47.520]  This is not a book of preachy. This is a book of stories.
[01:39:47.520 --> 01:39:55.520]  Well, exactly. What I get from that is death's the great equalizer and all of our shared humanity and struggles together unify us.
[01:39:55.520 --> 01:40:03.520]  If you tell stories about life and death and friends, it brings everybody together. A Holocaust survivor or some guy with Nazi sympathies.
[01:40:03.520 --> 01:40:13.520]  That's why they want to keep us divided and dumb the culture down because literature like that that points out real feelings we had unifies us in our humanity and our life and our death.
[01:40:13.520 --> 01:40:18.520]  The vision is what we're talking about. And we have to remember that as the true resistance.
[01:40:18.520 --> 01:40:24.520]  Isn't it interesting how smart the devil is? They take we who are the resistance and make themselves into resistors.
[01:40:24.520 --> 01:40:25.520]  Exactly.
[01:40:25.520 --> 01:40:30.520]  I see all these dumb idiots driving around here in San Francisco with the bumper stick as they say resist.
[01:40:30.520 --> 01:40:36.520]  And you've been saying and I've been saying we are the resistance for decades. Suddenly they're the resistance. No, we haven't taken the country back.
[01:40:36.520 --> 01:40:40.520]  We're just beginning to pull the pus out.
[01:40:40.520 --> 01:40:50.520]  Well, I understand all of it. The hatred for Donald Trump is not really a hatred for Donald Trump. It's a hatred for white heterosexual Christian males.
[01:40:50.520 --> 01:40:59.520]  We know that everyone knows that it's because he's a white heterosexual Christian male. It's not because he's a left winger or a right winger.
[01:40:59.520 --> 01:41:06.520]  They just wanted somebody other than a white heterosexual Christian male in the White House period and the story.
[01:41:06.520 --> 01:41:12.520]  I was going to ask you to have me do one more little segment of the break. Now suddenly it's a coming out, not mainly by minorities.
[01:41:12.520 --> 01:41:18.520]  Mainly white people and others saying whites are evil. Get rid of them. If you have a white baby, abort it.
[01:41:18.520 --> 01:41:27.520]  Major feminist magazines. This isn't just a few people. The left is really showing us that there's an anti-Christian, anti-white to an Italian level, but reversed.
[01:41:27.520 --> 01:41:30.520]  But Hitler wasn't a Christian. He was an anti-Christian.
[01:41:30.520 --> 01:41:34.520]  This is how it started. This is what they do. They demonize us first.
[01:41:34.520 --> 01:41:41.520]  Then they march us into the camps and then they kill us. I'm warning people out there. It's much worse than they think. It starts with an idea.
[01:41:41.520 --> 01:41:48.520]  The Holocaust started with an idea written by a French anti-Semite a long time before the ovens were actually built.
[01:41:48.520 --> 01:41:54.520]  A long time before the Zyklon B was actually manufactured. I'm warning everybody listening to me.
[01:41:54.520 --> 01:42:01.520]  These professors are the true evil Nazis of our time. These must be weeded out like the poison that they are.
[01:42:01.520 --> 01:42:09.520]  And the universities that harbor these evil failed intellects must be called on the carpet as well.
[01:42:09.520 --> 01:42:12.520]  I blame the universities. I don't blame these marginal psychotics.
[01:42:12.520 --> 01:42:19.520]  Paul Pot. How did Paul Pot start? A little tiny guy in Cambodia. He went to Paris to study Marxism.
[01:42:19.520 --> 01:42:24.520]  He became enthralled with Marxism. He came back and introduced Marxism in Cambodia.
[01:42:24.520 --> 01:42:30.520]  He put together the 13-year-olds, the 14-year-olds. He gave them the red bandanas. He called them the red brigades.
[01:42:30.520 --> 01:42:36.520]  What did the red brigades do? The Khmer Rouge? They went and they started by humiliating the middle class.
[01:42:36.520 --> 01:42:41.520]  Their own race now. Doctors, lawyers, engineers, architects.
[01:42:41.520 --> 01:42:46.520]  Hold on. Do one more segment. Explain the process of how they get a group ready to be exterminated.
[01:42:46.520 --> 01:42:50.520]  And you see it again, exactly being followed formulaically.
[01:42:50.520 --> 01:42:55.520]  And then you hear the weatherman and others saying, we're going to round up the Christians and conservatives. We're going to kill you.
[01:42:55.520 --> 01:43:00.520]  Men, give your body the support it needs with InfoWars Life Prostaguard.

[01:43:56.520 --> 01:44:02.520]  I'm driving home here about to take off a few days from Thanksgiving.
[01:44:02.520 --> 01:44:09.520]  And I just want to impart my message to the listeners and viewers of how much I appreciate you and how thankful I am.
[01:44:09.520 --> 01:44:16.520]  And I also just want to re-emphasize the point that if you weren't there taking action, and if you weren't there spreading the word,
[01:44:16.520 --> 01:44:20.520]  globalism would have completely taken over not just this country but other nations.
[01:44:20.520 --> 01:44:34.520]  And globalism is a completely anti-individual, anti-God, anti-family, anti-Christian cancer that is just pure power cult will to dominate and control society.
[01:44:34.520 --> 01:44:40.520]  And that we have come so far with God's help and have turned the tide with the enemies tracking back.
[01:44:40.520 --> 01:44:46.520]  So just please, we should all be so thankful to God and thankful to each other for taking action.
[01:44:46.520 --> 01:44:51.520]  But also, girt ourselves and get ready for the next big fight ahead because history is happening.
[01:44:51.520 --> 01:44:55.520]  So for myself and my family, God bless you all. Have a great Thanksgiving.
[01:44:57.520 --> 01:45:07.520]  I point out a lot to our listeners and viewers that without you funding our operation by purchasing products at InfoWarsLife.com, we would not be here.
[01:45:07.520 --> 01:45:12.520]  We don't have corporate sponsors. We don't have globalist funding. We're funded by patriots like you.

[01:45:26.520 --> 01:45:32.520]  That said, we're running biggest specials ever every single year during Black Friday.

[01:45:55.520 --> 01:46:02.520]  America is an information-based civil war. That's why now, more than ever, we've got to hit the streets of America
[01:46:02.520 --> 01:46:07.520]  and let these globalists scum know we're not backing down from their bullies.
[01:46:07.520 --> 01:46:13.520]  We're only intensifying our operations in the face of their wannabe dictatorship.
[01:46:13.520 --> 01:46:21.520]  Being a conservative, a nationalist, a libertarian or simply a free speech advocate is truly the counterculture.
[01:46:21.520 --> 01:46:29.520]  The real punk rock is being a patriot who's pro-America, pro-capitalism and pro-freedom, who at the same time is tolerant.
[01:46:29.520 --> 01:46:37.520]  Modern liberalism is a counterfeit of Thomas Jefferson's class of the liberalism. They are the anti-liberal.
[01:46:37.520 --> 01:46:41.520]  To defend free speech, meet like-minded friends and promote freedom worldwide.
[01:46:41.520 --> 01:46:50.520]  We've got more than 60 original designs of high quality t-shirts for men and women, as well as more Patriot Feral at infowarstore.com.
[01:46:50.520 --> 01:46:55.520]  Be part of the Second American Revolution at infowarstore.com.
[01:47:20.520 --> 01:47:28.520]  The world is a dangerous place, not because of evil, but because of those who look on and do nothing.
[01:47:28.520 --> 01:47:33.520]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:47:33.520 --> 01:47:39.520]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center. It's Alex Jones.
[01:47:39.520 --> 01:47:46.520]  That's right, it's an information war. I go out in downtown Austin, downtown San Francisco, downtown,
[01:47:46.520 --> 01:47:51.520]  you know, areas, Upper West Side, New York, Seattle, people punch me.
[01:47:51.520 --> 01:47:54.520]  They throw coffee at me. They slap me in the back of the head.
[01:47:54.520 --> 01:47:59.520]  They come up behind me and knock my foot over and just say, F you, Nazi.
[01:47:59.520 --> 01:48:03.520]  And then their behavior is so Nazi-like in the stages of authoritarianism.
[01:48:03.520 --> 01:48:08.520]  First they yell at you, then they attack you, then they shut your business down, then they make you live in a ghetto,
[01:48:08.520 --> 01:48:14.520]  then they haul you off to prison, and Michael Savage was getting into the left, their authoritarianism.
[01:48:14.520 --> 01:48:19.520]  And all over the news, hashtag HuntRepublicans, and Rand Paul being tackled and attacked,
[01:48:19.520 --> 01:48:23.520]  and Republican members of city councils being shot in the face by their neighbors,
[01:48:23.520 --> 01:48:27.520]  and Congressmen's Colleges, and on and on, they're getting violent. They want violence.
[01:48:27.520 --> 01:48:34.520]  They're pushing it, and you were getting historically with the Khmer Rouge, Cambodia, and the Pol Pot, the killing fields,
[01:48:34.520 --> 01:48:41.520]  as an example, but it always basically follows the same formula. Please continue with that historic warning, Dr. Savage.
[01:48:41.520 --> 01:48:46.520]  I will, but I want to say something. The book God, Faith, and Reason, it's a very benign looking book, isn't it?
[01:48:46.520 --> 01:48:52.520]  Michael, let's say you don't know me, you see this in the bookstore. Nice old guy, God, Faith, and Reason.
[01:48:52.520 --> 01:49:02.520]  If people took this to work and put it on their desks, let's see how tolerant the left is from a benign book such as this,
[01:49:02.520 --> 01:49:06.520]  which is almost apolitical, okay? Let's just see it as a little billboard on a desk at work.
[01:49:06.520 --> 01:49:13.520]  Pol Pot, Cambodia. Nice professor, goes to Paris, studies Marxism, comes back and says,
[01:49:13.520 --> 01:49:20.520]  I want to introduce that economic system, so he introduces it, then he hires 12, 13, 14-year-old boys and girls,
[01:49:20.520 --> 01:49:25.520]  gives them the Khmer Rouge, the red scarf. He tells them, go out and humiliate the teachers.
[01:49:25.520 --> 01:49:31.520]  Anyone who could read or write, anyone who was literate in Cambodia was targeted by the Marxists.
[01:49:31.520 --> 01:49:38.520]  Didn't mean, well, one race, remember that. Teachers, doctors, lawyers, engineers, countains, didn't matter.
[01:49:38.520 --> 01:49:43.520]  Any literate person was first humiliated, personally humiliated in the street like you're being yelled at.
[01:49:43.520 --> 01:49:51.520]  That's how it starts. And the thugs, the Khmer Rouge, then worked them in the fields and killed them.
[01:49:51.520 --> 01:49:55.520]  Now, we had the mountain of skulls. That's what communism brings.
[01:49:55.520 --> 01:50:02.520]  That's what Rachel Madcow, Wolf Blitzer and Company will bring to this country unless they are taught who they are
[01:50:02.520 --> 01:50:06.520]  and what they're doing to this nation. They may not actually think they want that to happen,
[01:50:06.520 --> 01:50:10.520]  but they will lead to a mountain of skulls unless they are reigned in.
[01:50:10.520 --> 01:50:17.520]  Somebody has to explain to these sub-morons, these sub-intellectuals, these pseudo-intellectuals, these uneducated adults
[01:50:17.520 --> 01:50:24.520]  that things start with an idea. Okay? Now, you see in this country, who's the Khmer Rouge? Do we have it?
[01:50:24.520 --> 01:50:27.520]  Well, of course we have it. The antifa, the Democratic Party.
[01:50:27.520 --> 01:50:32.520]  How about Ferguson, Missouri? How about Baltimore, Maryland? What was that?
[01:50:32.520 --> 01:50:38.520]  There was a reason for Ferguson, burning a city down, attacking police, the killing of police, the war against police.
[01:50:38.520 --> 01:50:43.520]  This is all part of the same Khmer Rouge effect in the United States of America.
[01:50:43.520 --> 01:50:47.520]  They couch it under the guise of only certain lives matter.
[01:50:47.520 --> 01:50:56.520]  They use race as a shield and a spear to silence those of us who see who they are, but never forget their end.
[01:50:56.520 --> 01:51:01.520]  They have set point blank what they want to do. They want to kill 30 million Americans.
[01:51:01.520 --> 01:51:06.520]  I read this in the 60s, Alex. This is nothing new. I forget the name of the group.
[01:51:06.520 --> 01:51:08.520]  He's still alive. He's Obama's good friend there in Chicago.
[01:51:08.520 --> 01:51:11.520]  Yeah, that's the weatherman that Bill Ayers said.
[01:51:11.520 --> 01:51:15.520]  Thank you. Bill Ayers was a member of a group that said if we kill 30 million Americans,
[01:51:15.520 --> 01:51:19.520]  we'll be able to save America. Don't think that they still don't want to do it.
[01:51:19.520 --> 01:51:22.520]  Our population's doubled since then, so it'd be 60 million.
[01:51:22.520 --> 01:51:26.520]  Well, about the number that was killed in other countries under that kind of psychosis.
[01:51:26.520 --> 01:51:31.520]  So if it's kill or be killed, people better take the proper steps to protect themselves.
[01:51:31.520 --> 01:51:35.520]  Last February, I was attacked outside a restaurant. Remember that story?
[01:51:35.520 --> 01:51:36.520]  Yes.
[01:51:36.520 --> 01:51:41.520]  Okay. I mean, I'm an older guy. I didn't pick a fight. I was sitting there with my dog having two drinks.
[01:51:41.520 --> 01:51:45.520]  People came and liked me. We talked, and some guy was on the end of a bar older guy.
[01:51:45.520 --> 01:51:50.520]  I didn't say one word to him. I didn't even look at him and then what he was, I walked out of the restaurant.
[01:51:50.520 --> 01:51:54.520]  I turned around. The area's looming over me. 20 years younger, a foot taller.
[01:51:54.520 --> 01:51:57.520]  One thing led to another. I wound up on my ass.
[01:51:57.520 --> 01:52:01.520]  Luckily, I didn't die. I didn't break my skull. The dog got scared to death.
[01:52:01.520 --> 01:52:03.520]  The poor little teddy was shaking like a leaf.
[01:52:03.520 --> 01:52:07.520]  Rand Paul had six broken ribs and a punctured lung, and then now he's come out and said,
[01:52:07.520 --> 01:52:11.520]  No, the neighbor hates me. He's a leftist, and the media is making excuses for it.
[01:52:11.520 --> 01:52:14.520]  He tackled him and then started stomping him in his yard.
[01:52:14.520 --> 01:52:18.520]  Unbelievable. This guy should be charged with murder. First of all, he's a U.S. senator.
[01:52:18.520 --> 01:52:22.520]  How come he had no secret service? Diane Feinstein has secret service?
[01:52:22.520 --> 01:52:26.520]  Wait a minute. Why doesn't he have any secret service? It only applies to the leftists?
[01:52:26.520 --> 01:52:28.520]  Let's put that aside. We're all at risk right now.
[01:52:28.520 --> 01:52:33.520]  I don't think conservatives and people are just too regular. He was mowing his own yard.
[01:52:33.520 --> 01:52:38.520]  Well, that's a terrible story. He could have been killed, but the point of my being knocked to the ground was,
[01:52:38.520 --> 01:52:42.520]  Who protected me at that time from getting killed, hurt, banging my head, breaking my ribs?
[01:52:42.520 --> 01:52:45.520]  I'm an older guy. How come I didn't break anything?
[01:52:45.520 --> 01:52:49.520]  Alex, I'm going to tell the story on the air today several times in my life, and I'm not tempting fate.
[01:52:49.520 --> 01:52:52.520]  God knows I'm not tempting fate.
[01:52:52.520 --> 01:52:55.520]  I've seen a hand come down.
[01:52:55.520 --> 01:52:58.520]  A hand came down, cushioned the blow.
[01:52:58.520 --> 01:53:03.520]  It could be the push-ups I do at night. It could be a lifetime of very clean living.
[01:53:03.520 --> 01:53:08.520]  That's a joke, but nothing broke.
[01:53:08.520 --> 01:53:15.520]  I was in Fiji 30, 40 years ago when I was a plant collector looking from medicinal plants way ahead of all of the,
[01:53:15.520 --> 01:53:20.520]  you know, all of the people who think they know this field right now, plant collector.
[01:53:20.520 --> 01:53:23.520]  One night we're drinking kava kava all night. I wanted to leave the village.
[01:53:23.520 --> 01:53:27.520]  All of my Melanesian friends, they're black people in the islands.
[01:53:27.520 --> 01:53:32.520]  They used to look at me when we drank a lot of kava, and they'd say to me in Fiji, and I think he's Fiji,
[01:53:32.520 --> 01:53:36.520]  and they'd look at my eyes. I guess that was a transracial thing at the time.
[01:53:36.520 --> 01:53:38.520]  They loved me. I loved them.
[01:53:38.520 --> 01:53:43.520]  All of a sudden, in the middle of this kava drinking, I had an instinct. I wanted to leave that village.
[01:53:43.520 --> 01:53:46.520]  I said, this was my friend, Dominico, I said, don't go, don't go, don't go.
[01:53:46.520 --> 01:53:49.520]  I said, I have to go. He said, I can't go right now, man. We've been drinking this all night.
[01:53:49.520 --> 01:53:53.520]  I said, I got to get out of here. So I go, I walk in the dark along an edge.
[01:53:53.520 --> 01:53:57.520]  I go back to my other village. The next morning he comes to me, he was like shaking.
[01:53:57.520 --> 01:54:00.520]  He said, come back with me. I want you to see what you walked on.
[01:54:00.520 --> 01:54:06.520]  He said, you were walking on a path that fell about 500 feet to the sea.
[01:54:06.520 --> 01:54:10.520]  It was six inches wide, this little path that you were on, and you didn't fall.
[01:54:10.520 --> 01:54:16.520]  I look back on that moment, and I have to say to you, I think that God put me here for a reason.
[01:54:16.520 --> 01:54:20.520]  And I think the reason is the sinquanon of God's faith and reason.
[01:54:20.520 --> 01:54:24.520]  I believe this book can be the one that reaches to those who have left God.
[01:54:24.520 --> 01:54:28.520]  And again, it's not a book to bring you to a church or a synagogue or a temple.
[01:54:28.520 --> 01:54:33.520]  It's a book to bring you to yourself because in looking for God, you'll find yourself.
[01:54:33.520 --> 01:54:36.520]  People don't know who they are today. You'll throw away the drugs.
[01:54:36.520 --> 01:54:39.520]  You'll throw away all the crutches. You'll throw away the beads.
[01:54:39.520 --> 01:54:43.520]  You'll throw away the dream catchers. You'll throw away your evil leftism.
[01:54:43.520 --> 01:54:49.520]  And you just might find that God might be your salvation because believe me, as I sit here,
[01:54:49.520 --> 01:54:52.520]  there's a reason for everything, and God is above all of us.
[01:54:52.520 --> 01:54:57.520]  As Rocky Graziano, the great middleweight fighter said, somebody up there likes me.
[01:54:57.520 --> 01:55:01.520]  And I hope that somebody up there likes you, Alec, and I hope somebody up there likes me.
[01:55:01.520 --> 01:55:05.520]  And I hope somebody up there really still likes America, despite what we have done to ourselves,
[01:55:05.520 --> 01:55:11.520]  by permitting this virus of left-wing fascism to take over the country.
[01:55:11.520 --> 01:55:15.520]  Well, I think you've hit the hard here. It's not just that liberalism is a mental illness.
[01:55:15.520 --> 01:55:19.520]  Liberals hate God, and they hate existing success.
[01:55:19.520 --> 01:55:22.520]  And they don't want to join with it, even though we're not trying to make them.
[01:55:22.520 --> 01:55:26.520]  We have free will. They don't like that we made some of the better free will discussions
[01:55:26.520 --> 01:55:29.520]  and some of the better free will choices in our life.
[01:55:29.520 --> 01:55:34.520]  And they don't like free will and want to force us into their authoritarianism.
[01:55:34.520 --> 01:55:38.520]  And then they believe they're in power by bullying us intellectually and spiritually.
[01:55:38.520 --> 01:55:42.520]  As they see us rebelling, they're having an existential crisis
[01:55:42.520 --> 01:55:46.520]  because they feel like they're dying, as their control over us is dissipated.
[01:55:46.520 --> 01:55:51.520]  They're going through a true breakdown.
[01:55:51.520 --> 01:55:53.520]  Look at all the major inventions of the world.
[01:55:53.520 --> 01:55:59.520]  Trains, cars, planes, telegraph, computers, medical advances.
[01:55:59.520 --> 01:56:03.520]  I'm sorry to break the news to all of those out there who don't want to know the news.
[01:56:03.520 --> 01:56:07.520]  All invented by dead white males.
[01:56:07.520 --> 01:56:09.520]  You want to make it real down home here?
[01:56:09.520 --> 01:56:14.520]  I can name one invention after the other. Almost all of them invented by dead white males.
[01:56:14.520 --> 01:56:19.520]  Now it is true that thousands of years ago, or a thousand years ago actually,
[01:56:19.520 --> 01:56:21.520]  China was more advanced than any country on earth.
[01:56:21.520 --> 01:56:24.520]  Six-masted sailing ships, coal mines.
[01:56:24.520 --> 01:56:27.520]  And do you know when those advancements in China came to an end?
[01:56:27.520 --> 01:56:30.520]  When the Mandarin's took over. Who were the Mandarin's at that time?
[01:56:30.520 --> 01:56:33.520]  The Mandarin's were the central government types, the long fingernails.
[01:56:33.520 --> 01:56:37.520]  They sat up there in the Washington, DC of China and they controlled everyone's life.
[01:56:37.520 --> 01:56:40.520]  They killed all creativity, all inventiveness in China.
[01:56:40.520 --> 01:56:45.520]  We'd already be out of the solar system with Mars bases if the Mandarin's hadn't taken over.
[01:56:45.520 --> 01:56:49.520]  That's right. So the Mandarin's are now trying to take over again through the media.
[01:56:49.520 --> 01:56:52.520]  The Mandarin's are right there. Jake Tapper, Mandarin.
[01:56:52.520 --> 01:56:53.520]  Wolfie Blitz.
[01:56:53.520 --> 01:56:54.520]  Legalist.
[01:56:54.520 --> 01:56:56.520]  Mandarin, Mandarin, Mandarin, Mandarin, Mandarin.
[01:56:56.520 --> 01:56:58.520]  I'm not talking about Mandarin oranges.
[01:56:58.520 --> 01:57:01.520]  They're control-free cultists of New Dark Age. They want to run everything.
[01:57:01.520 --> 01:57:04.520]  Very dangerous people. Never forget who the enemy is.
[01:57:04.520 --> 01:57:08.520]  They have names. They have faces. Never forget who they are.
[01:57:08.520 --> 01:57:12.520]  They are the intellectual avant-garde that will lead to the mountain of skulls
[01:57:12.520 --> 01:57:15.520]  unless they're called out and spit upon verbally and intellectually.
[01:57:15.520 --> 01:57:16.520]  That's all I want to say about it.
[01:57:16.520 --> 01:57:19.520]  You know, at a certain time, you've got to roll your sleeves up and get down in the gutter
[01:57:19.520 --> 01:57:23.520]  and not be so intellectual about it. These people are out for blood.
[01:57:23.520 --> 01:57:26.520]  Michael Savage, thank you for giving us a whole hour.
[01:57:26.520 --> 01:57:28.520]  I know you're a very busy guy. Your show's coming up in one hour.

[01:57:41.520 --> 01:57:43.520]  God bless, Alex. Thank you.
[01:57:43.520 --> 01:57:45.520]  We need God. Absolutely. God bless you.

[01:59:56.520 --> 02:00:00.520]  Well here we are ladies and gentlemen, Thanksgiving.
[02:00:00.520 --> 02:00:06.520]  One of the few true American holidays that we've got probably my favorite holiday.
[02:00:06.520 --> 02:00:09.520]  The 23rd day of November 2017.
[02:00:09.520 --> 02:00:15.520]  We've seen total demonization of the Italian Christopher Columbus.
[02:00:15.520 --> 02:00:17.520]  We've seen the total demonization of Thanksgiving.
[02:00:17.520 --> 02:00:27.520]  We've seen attempts to get rid of the holiday to use it to cast aspersions on western civilization and western expansion.
[02:00:27.520 --> 02:00:32.520]  Undoubtedly was a mess and there were crimes on all sides.
[02:00:32.520 --> 02:00:41.520]  When I say all sides, it wasn't just the settlers or it wasn't just the troops or it wasn't just the empires or it wasn't just all the different native tribes.
[02:00:41.520 --> 02:00:54.520]  It was all of those different countless changing factions that played into this long before colonized North America.
[02:00:54.520 --> 02:00:59.520]  The Vikings certainly visited it for a thousand years before Christopher Columbus supposedly discovered it.
[02:00:59.520 --> 02:01:01.520]  That's now documented.
[02:01:01.520 --> 02:01:17.520]  But long before white men ever colonized it, all the native tribes did was run around and trying to dominate and control each other and take over and kill the men and then take the women and the children.
[02:01:17.520 --> 02:01:27.520]  The same stuff that was going on in Europe for 10,000 years, same stuff going on in Africa for 10,000 years, the same stuff going on everywhere in the world.
[02:01:27.520 --> 02:01:30.520]  Humans acted the same.
[02:01:30.520 --> 02:01:42.520]  And so we never see big pieces being done on the bad things that the Native Americans did or the way they behaved because it's not part of the liberation theology.
[02:01:42.520 --> 02:01:57.520]  Starting in the 50s, the Ford Foundation, the Carnegie Endowment, created liberation theology where they thought Jesus would have fought back and was a revolutionary and hated capitalism and was a communist.
[02:01:57.520 --> 02:02:06.520]  And so they got the different populations that were Christian and poor, black, Hispanic, you name it, to become liberation theologists.
[02:02:06.520 --> 02:02:12.520]  And that was just one part of it, but to teach that in the schools to everybody that America was bad, the founders were bad.
[02:02:12.520 --> 02:02:31.520]  This was an undermining of the nation state and our ethos, where we came from, so that people of color particularly wouldn't have an idea in their head that they had a right to the American birthright or that they'd been part critical parts of this great saga.
[02:02:31.520 --> 02:02:36.520]  No, it's all just you were good, but you were exploited and the whites were bad.
[02:02:36.520 --> 02:02:47.520]  When it was way more complex with whites that were religious servants and bounties and people basically as slaves and company stores and sharecroppers.
[02:02:47.520 --> 02:02:51.520]  But they just continued to play on the incredible ignorance of the public.
[02:02:51.520 --> 02:02:56.520]  The last few weeks seeing in claims they've broken the news that there's slave auctions in Libya.
[02:02:56.520 --> 02:03:01.520]  They've broken the news in seven different Muslim countries.
[02:03:01.520 --> 02:03:07.520]  They sell women on top slave blocks, you know, up on a stage and it's all known.
[02:03:07.520 --> 02:03:09.520]  It's Muslims doing it.
[02:03:09.520 --> 02:03:17.520]  But all these reports from CNN breaking, you know, this supposed news that we've been talking about forever and others have been documenting.
[02:03:17.520 --> 02:03:28.520]  It's about, oh, the poor migrants, the poor babies, the poor migrants, these are people in Africa that are being kidnapped and grabbed and sold into slavery by Muslims.
[02:03:28.520 --> 02:03:32.520]  But somehow they turn it into, quote, Muslims by using the term migrant.
[02:03:32.520 --> 02:03:36.520]  That's the new definition of Muslims is a migrant, never a Muslim invader.
[02:03:36.520 --> 02:03:44.520]  So they take Muslims and slaving people and then turn it into the catchall word of poor little Muslims, which is migrant.
[02:03:44.520 --> 02:03:50.520]  So they know what they're doing, ladies and gentlemen, but we're going to be covering that a lot more here during the transmission.
[02:03:50.520 --> 02:03:56.520]  But I'm proud of Thanksgiving and I give thanks to you, the audience, thanks to God, thanks to my family, thanks to the great crew.
[02:03:56.520 --> 02:03:59.520]  And I just want to thank you all for what you've done.
[02:03:59.520 --> 02:04:06.520]  We have extended the specials from earlier in the week as we plan to do, but we have new specials that are added each day.
[02:04:06.520 --> 02:04:13.520]  And X2 is 50% off, super high quality, just absolutely needed.
[02:04:13.520 --> 02:04:21.520]  We have iodine and then we also have a Lexapure Pro water filtration 25% off right now.
[02:04:21.520 --> 02:04:30.520]  So take advantage of that 50% off brain force, 25% off other water filtration systems, 60% plus percent off of silver bullet, knock out 50% off.
[02:04:30.520 --> 02:04:32.520]  A bunch of stuff is there.
[02:04:32.520 --> 02:04:39.520]  Biggest sales ever, infowarstore.com, infowarslife.com or triple eight, 253-3139.
[02:04:39.520 --> 02:04:45.520]  I want to thank you all for what you've done. I want to thank you all for your victory, breaking your conditioning against the globalist.
[02:04:45.520 --> 02:04:53.520]  I want to encourage you all to keep supporting the broadcast by purchasing high quality products at infowarsstore.com, which is a win-win for everybody because they're high quality.
[02:04:53.520 --> 02:04:56.520]  And it helps fund this operation. Thank you so much.
[02:04:56.520 --> 02:05:01.520]  I'm driving home here about to take off a few days for Thanksgiving.
[02:05:01.520 --> 02:05:08.520]  And I just want to impart my message to the listeners and viewers of how much I appreciate you and how thankful I am.
[02:05:08.520 --> 02:05:20.520]  And I also just want to re-emphasize the point that if you weren't there taking action and if you weren't there spreading the word, globalism would have completely taken over not just this country but other nations.
[02:05:20.520 --> 02:05:34.520]  And globalism is a completely anti-individual, anti-God, anti-family, anti-Christian cancer that is just pure power cult will to dominate and control society.
[02:05:34.520 --> 02:05:40.520]  And that we have come so far with God's help and have turned the tide but the enemy is tracking back.
[02:05:40.520 --> 02:05:45.520]  So just please, we should all be so thankful to God and thankful to each other for taking action.
[02:05:45.520 --> 02:05:51.520]  But also, girt ourselves and get ready for the next big fight ahead because history is happening.
[02:05:51.520 --> 02:06:06.520]  For myself and my family, God bless you all. Have a great Thanksgiving.
[02:06:21.520 --> 02:06:32.520]  God bless you all.
[02:06:52.520 --> 02:07:06.520]  Candace Owens, Red Bull Black just set me on fire. I wanted to kick into that again when I talked about the type of person Trump is and how he's a fighter and how he went to Scotland for six months about a year before he decided to run or before he announced it.
[02:07:06.520 --> 02:07:10.520]  And he made the decision not to do it for his family.
[02:07:10.520 --> 02:07:19.520]  And then he felt so guilty that he basically envisioned the whole thing, winning, how they'd make fun of him, what they'd do, what would unfold.
[02:07:19.520 --> 02:07:26.520]  And I was told this by Roger Stone, who talked to Trump about it at length, was the head of his campaign at first.
[02:07:26.520 --> 02:07:32.520]  And then later in Politico, there was this whole article about how Trump did it.
[02:07:32.520 --> 02:07:41.520]  And it had some of the same stuff from Bannon and others about what Trump did.
[02:07:41.520 --> 02:07:47.520]  And he's very fatalistic. That's why he'll walk without the Secret Service and he just says, I don't care, stand down.
[02:07:47.520 --> 02:07:55.520]  And he doesn't want to die, but if somebody kills him, then he knows we'll win even bigger.
[02:07:55.520 --> 02:08:00.520]  It's something else, folks. I mean, Trump's the real warrior, the real deal.
[02:08:00.520 --> 02:08:04.520]  And I'll tell you, I know the other biasing stuff. He's not a racist.
[02:08:04.520 --> 02:08:13.520]  In fact, it's the opposite. And I'm not going to be patronizing about it and say, Donald Trump really likes black people, but he does because he likes people that are optimistic, energy strong.
[02:08:13.520 --> 02:08:17.520]  He loves everybody unless you're trying to dominate him, then he wants to dominate you.
[02:08:17.520 --> 02:08:22.520]  And who he wants to dominate is the bullies. He wants to set America loose, folks.
[02:08:22.520 --> 02:08:25.520]  And he got screwed over. His dad came from nowhere.
[02:08:25.520 --> 02:08:30.520]  Their family had to fight in New York, in the middle of that with the mob and everything to be builders, and they won.
[02:08:30.520 --> 02:08:34.520]  You don't think they didn't do some stuff behind the scenes? Let folks know, leave them alone?
[02:08:34.520 --> 02:08:39.520]  I mean, the Trumps are fighters, folks, and the globalists are scared of him.
[02:08:39.520 --> 02:08:43.520]  It's real. Does it mean he's not co-opting them? Does it mean he doesn't do everything perfect?
[02:08:43.520 --> 02:08:47.520]  He's getting the best done he can, and that's why they're so scared.
[02:08:47.520 --> 02:08:50.520]  And I'm not going to go over all the accomplishments, but you just set me on fire there.
[02:08:50.520 --> 02:08:56.520]  Spent a few minutes about this conference, hearing Bannon speak, who this woman was you saw speak, talking about what other countries are like.
[02:08:56.520 --> 02:09:00.520]  Because let me tell you, you go to some other countries, folks, especially third-world countries or other stuff.
[02:09:00.520 --> 02:09:06.520]  You learn real quick what authoritarianism is, what bondage is, what people giving up is.
[02:09:06.520 --> 02:09:14.520]  And then you understand, now I see why the globalists fashion America so much, because it's got ideas that ever implemented bring down their global system.
[02:09:14.520 --> 02:09:17.520]  Doesn't mean we don't have sins. Doesn't mean we don't have big problems.
[02:09:17.520 --> 02:09:23.520]  The difference is we've had these experiences together, and we've got an idea that Martin Luther King talked about,
[02:09:23.520 --> 02:09:26.520]  that is the American dream, that we haven't really realized it, is unlimited.
[02:09:26.520 --> 02:09:30.520]  Just 10% getting realized that it's the richest country in the world.
[02:09:30.520 --> 02:09:35.520]  We had half the world's wealth until about a decade ago, and it's because we were creating the wealth.
[02:09:35.520 --> 02:09:40.520]  So, get back into this conference, who you heard speak, give us the details, Candace, Red Pill Black.
[02:09:40.520 --> 02:09:44.520]  It's not over yet. I can just tell you that this is the most amazing thing.
[02:09:44.520 --> 02:09:51.520]  And I staff over the sentiment and the emotions of what I'm feeling right now, having just had these conversations.
[02:09:51.520 --> 02:09:58.520]  So, to take it from the top, I mean, we get in last night, and the first person that I have a long conversation with is Ann Coulter.
[02:09:58.520 --> 02:10:02.520]  And I'm just telling her, like, you're amazing. I have read all of your stuff.
[02:10:02.520 --> 02:10:05.520]  I came from the left, now I'm on the right, and I'm telling her I'm getting attacked.
[02:10:05.520 --> 02:10:08.520]  And she just instills that confidence, you know, face-to-face.
[02:10:08.520 --> 02:10:11.520]  She says, you know what you do? You punch back, and you keep going.
[02:10:11.520 --> 02:10:14.520]  And you keep doing what you do. You punch back, and you keep going.
[02:10:14.520 --> 02:10:19.520]  And that has been the mentality and the theme of this counter-resistance, which is a David Horowitz event.
[02:10:19.520 --> 02:10:24.520]  He does it once a year, and he really pulls everybody that is on the front line.
[02:10:24.520 --> 02:10:29.520]  Everyone that is getting killed by the press, killed by people in the community that are lying about
[02:10:29.520 --> 02:10:34.520]  and smearing them when they're just trying to do the right patriotic thing to do for this country.
[02:10:34.520 --> 02:10:38.520]  Katie Hopkins, if you don't know her, she's a British reporter. She's huge, absolutely massive.
[02:10:38.520 --> 02:10:42.520]  She writes for the Daily Mail, she's the one that writes all those pieces.
[02:10:42.520 --> 02:10:45.520]  And her speech, I mean, I thought I almost brought tears to my eyes.
[02:10:45.520 --> 02:10:50.520]  I mean, everyone was on their feet, just a round of applause, standing ovation for her.
[02:10:50.520 --> 02:10:54.520]  She was so funny and so quirky in the way that only the Brits can do.
[02:10:54.520 --> 02:10:56.520]  Milo's going to be speaking, Ann's going to be speaking.
[02:10:56.520 --> 02:11:00.520]  Gavin McTinnis up there. I mean, I don't think I'd laugh harder.
[02:11:00.520 --> 02:11:03.520]  He's like, he could be a stand-up comedian and he's just talking about...
[02:11:03.520 --> 02:11:11.520]  He used to be a stand-up comedian. He got blacklisted because he became a libertarian.
[02:11:11.520 --> 02:11:17.520]  Yeah. Well, and he's just telling the story about how he was at the deport ball and he just punched somebody back.
[02:11:17.520 --> 02:11:21.520]  And that sort of is a symbolic of what it is that we're talking about.
[02:11:21.520 --> 02:11:24.520]  And they can't stand the fact that we're finally punching back.
[02:11:24.520 --> 02:11:29.520]  Yeah. They don't know what to do. And he says that. He says the person made a face and they just couldn't believe it, Alex.
[02:11:29.520 --> 02:11:33.520]  They couldn't believe that they were getting punched back, you know, because they saw him.
[02:11:33.520 --> 02:11:37.520]  They have just been the bullies and they have been punching us and they've been saying, this is what you are.
[02:11:37.520 --> 02:11:40.520]  They tell me, you're a coon, you're an uncle, Tom, you're a doctor, you're this and you're that.
[02:11:40.520 --> 02:11:43.520]  And I'm saying, I'm not going to take it sitting down, okay?
[02:11:43.520 --> 02:11:49.520]  We are the counter-resistance. We are here. And Steve Bannon, when he talked about Trump and his fighting spirit and how he met him.
[02:11:49.520 --> 02:11:57.520]  And everyone here is telling their experiences. There's a double amputee who is, I believe, the congressman in Florida.
[02:11:57.520 --> 02:12:01.520]  You know, he fought for this country, lost his legs, and now he's the congressman.
[02:12:01.520 --> 02:12:06.520]  He is talking to us, telling us about how patriotic he is and how he wants to help this country.
[02:12:06.520 --> 02:12:12.520]  And meanwhile, Colin Kaepernick is on the cover for GQ, okay? He's on the cover for an outstand.
[02:12:12.520 --> 02:12:18.520]  And it looks so stupid when you see the covers with Colbert and all of them propped up.
[02:12:18.520 --> 02:12:23.520]  It's embarrassing. I wouldn't be on the cover of GQ if they asked me now. I wouldn't take a peace prize now.
[02:12:23.520 --> 02:12:26.520]  They don't get what jokes they are.
[02:12:26.520 --> 02:12:33.520]  It's such a joke. But when you look at this guy who's got two prosthetic legs and he is still fighting for this country as a congressman.
[02:12:33.520 --> 02:12:36.520]  And you feel the energy in that room when he spoke.
[02:12:36.520 --> 02:12:41.520]  And by the way, he's the same congressman that went in when they wouldn't put up even three, four months in.
[02:12:41.520 --> 02:12:43.520]  Trump's pitcher at the VA in Florida, remember?
[02:12:43.520 --> 02:12:48.520]  Right, yes. Yeah, he is just this man, okay, is amazing, okay?
[02:12:48.520 --> 02:12:55.520]  And I cannot emphasize enough how amazing this man is and how he can move the room and his experience, his fighting spirit.
[02:12:55.520 --> 02:13:00.520]  Is that fighting spirit? That is what David Horowitz was able to curate with this weekend.
[02:13:00.520 --> 02:13:06.520]  If you are a fighter, if they are trying to silence you, you are here this weekend and he wants you to inspire one another.
[02:13:06.520 --> 02:13:08.520]  And that's why he's the audience to know.
[02:13:08.520 --> 02:13:13.520]  And I know they're not doing it, but you can't go to sleep and I know you're not meant to fight politics every year, every month.
[02:13:13.520 --> 02:13:19.520]  But this is the big global turning. Every bit of energy we put in now goes on for thousands of years.
[02:13:19.520 --> 02:13:26.520]  Yes, this is a fight. There's no other fight. This is a fight that everyone needs to be and do whatever you do, whatever your town is.
[02:13:26.520 --> 02:13:32.520]  If it's videos, if it's talking, if it's blogging, if it's writing, be a part of this because we are making history right now, Alex.
[02:13:32.520 --> 02:13:35.520]  And I can't underestimate the power of prayer as well.
[02:13:35.520 --> 02:13:42.520]  Right. We need everything. And I say that all the time. It's not just me making videos, people that support me.
[02:13:42.520 --> 02:13:47.520]  I couldn't do without them. I couldn't do without them writing to me and saying, we don't believe this. Keep going, keep going.
[02:13:47.520 --> 02:13:52.520]  Absolutely. And the things they made up about you weren't even...
[02:13:52.520 --> 02:13:57.520]  The things they made up about you were all total bull. But again, exactly. Just say it's bull. Move on. Just keep getting the...
[02:13:57.520 --> 02:14:02.520]  Keep fighting. Punch back and keep going. That is what Ann Culber said to me. That is what Katie Hopkins said to me.
[02:14:02.520 --> 02:14:08.520]  I said, God bless you, woman, because they've been doing it for years and years and years. And I looked at myself and I said, what's my excuse?
[02:14:08.520 --> 02:14:12.520]  What am I upset about? You know, this is one of many smears that are going to come. They're going to try to shut me up.
[02:14:12.520 --> 02:14:19.520]  And you know what my job is? To punch back and keep going and to wake up the Black community because this is a war, okay?
[02:14:19.520 --> 02:14:28.520]  This is an information war. And what side of it you fall on is going to be how you represent yourself historically because we are making history right now.
[02:14:28.520 --> 02:14:34.520]  I was about to say, a lot of folks have come now and we're starting to have big victories, but this is the peak of the battle we're going into.
[02:14:34.520 --> 02:14:48.520]  So this is the hardest time, but also the best time to be getting involved. And every call to C-SPAN, everybody that wears a T-shirt in public, everybody that is loving their children, everybody that prays to God, everybody that supports a broadcast like this or shares a link.
[02:14:48.520 --> 02:14:54.520]  All of it together is a giant mountain of energy every day. Many hands make light work, folks.
[02:14:54.520 --> 02:15:00.520]  So again, when I tell you, thank you, InfoWars. The president's told me this. It's been said all over the news. They know it.
[02:15:00.520 --> 02:15:05.520]  Trump wouldn't be president if it wasn't for InfoWars. If it wasn't for you, the audience.
[02:15:05.520 --> 02:15:12.520]  We were the key heart cadre in support of an information warfare and in breaking stories.
[02:15:12.520 --> 02:15:16.520]  We were identified by Podesta Hill or everybody as the stories that sunk them.
[02:15:16.520 --> 02:15:25.520]  Now, again, those stories that sunk them, they're coming after me for now, but that's how time space works. It doesn't matter. I've already won that battle.
[02:15:25.520 --> 02:15:32.520]  The larger wars here, but I've now got to deal with missiles. They fired back at the time that that happened, but we're here. It's all happening.
[02:15:32.520 --> 02:15:36.520]  And I want you to know this is history. Candace Owens, Red Pill Black. I want to talk to you again.
[02:15:36.520 --> 02:15:42.520]  Whenever you want to come on, you're wonderful. You're amazing. And I'll say it. You've got a beautiful soul. We really appreciate it.
[02:15:42.520 --> 02:15:47.520]  That's why the enemy fears you. We'll talk to you soon. And please come on and give us a report about the rest of the event.
[02:15:47.520 --> 02:15:52.520]  Absolutely. I will. Thank you guys so much. I so appreciate you guys that watch InfoWars. You're amazing.
[02:15:52.520 --> 02:16:15.520]  We appreciate you.

[02:18:54.520 --> 02:19:02.520]  I know I don't have to remind most of you of the fact that culturally, societally, economically, spiritually, militarily,
[02:19:02.520 --> 02:19:11.520]  the planet's sitting on top of giant time bomb with populations and globalism and the new world order's manipulation of people's minds.
[02:19:11.520 --> 02:19:15.520]  Things are getting crazy. We're trying to fix the country and fix the planet.
[02:19:15.520 --> 02:19:18.520]  We've also got to have rearguard actions to be prepared.
[02:19:18.520 --> 02:19:23.520]  The number one thing after getting right with God is to have high-quality, durable food.

[02:19:32.520 --> 02:19:35.520]  50% off, you cannot beat that.
[02:19:35.520 --> 02:19:38.520]  And we're only doing that through Cyber Monday.
[02:19:38.520 --> 02:19:41.520]  So it starts today on Thanksgiving and runs through next Monday.
[02:19:41.520 --> 02:19:44.520]  Infowarstore.com, you can go right there.
[02:19:44.520 --> 02:19:46.520]  It's the full spectrum of my Patriot.
[02:19:46.520 --> 02:19:48.520]  It's private labeled by us, totally fresh.
[02:19:48.520 --> 02:19:51.520]  It's 25 years, 50% off.
[02:19:51.520 --> 02:20:06.520]  50% off, take action today.
[02:20:06.520 --> 02:20:22.520]  All right, Millie Weaver just got back from the Hillary Clinton event and she said she's getting stalked, getting followed, and they broke it into her phone.
[02:20:22.520 --> 02:20:27.520]  So I'm going to have to find out more from her during the next break, since that's going on right before I got on air 30 seconds ago, 45 seconds ago.
[02:20:27.520 --> 02:20:31.520]  So all hell's breaking loose basically here in the war room.
[02:20:31.520 --> 02:20:36.520]  I mean, that's what this is.
[02:20:36.520 --> 02:20:42.520]  It's like we had the all Franken news day and a half before, but I wasn't afraid to put it out.
[02:20:42.520 --> 02:20:50.520]  I was just like, okay, but I got to wait and I can't say who the woman is.
[02:20:50.520 --> 02:20:52.520]  I'm not going to cover it.
[02:20:52.520 --> 02:20:55.520]  And see, most people would want that big breaking story.
[02:20:55.520 --> 02:21:00.520]  I just want to be credible and actually help things and make things better.
[02:21:00.520 --> 02:21:05.520]  But you can see how we tweeted out just to have it on record before it came out that we had the news.
[02:21:05.520 --> 02:21:14.520]  Is that's why they constantly, you know, say, oh, we're fake news because they know folks, we make mistakes, but we're not trying to make mistakes.
[02:21:14.520 --> 02:21:18.520]  We are beating ourselves up to tell the truth.
[02:21:18.520 --> 02:21:23.520]  And not because we're Mr. Goodie tissues, man, we want to have integrity.
[02:21:23.520 --> 02:21:27.520]  My ancestors had integrity.
[02:21:27.520 --> 02:21:31.520]  I remember being a teenager, you're kind of naturally nasty when you're a teenager.
[02:21:31.520 --> 02:21:40.520]  I'm thinking my dad and his dad and my mother's dad and my mother's brother were just Mr. America Goodie two shoes.
[02:21:40.520 --> 02:21:42.520]  And it wasn't an act.
[02:21:42.520 --> 02:21:43.520]  It wasn't.
[02:21:43.520 --> 02:21:47.520]  It was like they were enslaved to being good men.
[02:21:47.520 --> 02:21:49.520]  I'm not as good as they are.
[02:21:49.520 --> 02:21:50.520]  I'll be honest with you.
[02:21:50.520 --> 02:21:51.520]  I have a dark side.
[02:21:51.520 --> 02:21:56.520]  I don't let it run me, but I can see into the enemy more because I see how they see us.
[02:21:56.520 --> 02:21:58.520]  So that's how God works.
[02:21:58.520 --> 02:22:00.520]  I'm more twisted.
[02:22:00.520 --> 02:22:05.520]  And so I understand what the enemy's up to.
[02:22:05.520 --> 02:22:19.520]  But back when I was darker, I was never given over to evil, but when I was darker, I thought they were weak because they were good men.
[02:22:19.520 --> 02:22:23.520]  People that are into evil, they think they're so strong because they're not good people.
[02:22:23.520 --> 02:22:26.520]  They think they're strong because they only care about themselves.
[02:22:26.520 --> 02:22:29.520]  They think they're weak.
[02:22:29.520 --> 02:22:31.520]  They're weak.
[02:22:31.520 --> 02:22:37.520]  You see, the fact that I have a weak side, I can understand these people.
[02:22:37.520 --> 02:22:40.520]  And my good side's big.
[02:22:40.520 --> 02:22:43.520]  That's the difference, though.
[02:22:43.520 --> 02:22:48.520]  Dad, I've got all these Hillary Cliffs I want to play.
[02:22:48.520 --> 02:22:50.520]  I'll get into their latest secret meeting.
[02:22:50.520 --> 02:22:51.520]  This is very, very important.
[02:22:51.520 --> 02:22:53.520]  I've got so many of these.
[02:22:53.520 --> 02:22:58.520]  Let's just go ahead and start with the first one and it's self-explanatory.
[02:22:58.520 --> 02:23:06.520]  Corporate media is now behaving like questioning the Clintons is some war crime and that Trump wants a dictatorship,
[02:23:06.520 --> 02:23:08.520]  even though the Clintons tried to get dictatorships.
[02:23:08.520 --> 02:23:11.520]  Obama tried to put it in that they're the ones that want to censor the press.
[02:23:11.520 --> 02:23:16.520]  They're the ones that want to open our borders up and sign us over to the TPP and dictatorial systems.
[02:23:16.520 --> 02:23:25.520]  And then now they're setting it up where Trump's the bad guy and anybody that criticizes the Clintons wants a dictatorship.
[02:23:25.520 --> 02:23:27.520]  Oh, because what, you're still in the government?
[02:23:27.520 --> 02:23:28.520]  So we want you out of government?
[02:23:28.520 --> 02:23:29.520]  That's a dictatorship?
[02:23:29.520 --> 02:23:31.520]  Because that's how they see it.
[02:23:31.520 --> 02:23:35.520]  It's their camp still in power and they're holding back the great Trump evil.
[02:23:35.520 --> 02:23:36.520]  Here it is.
[02:23:36.520 --> 02:23:44.520]  This appears to be the politicization of the Justice Department and our justice system.
[02:23:44.520 --> 02:23:53.520]  This Iranian one story has been debunked countless times by members of the press, by independent experts.
[02:23:53.520 --> 02:23:58.520]  It is nothing but a, you know, a false charge.
[02:23:58.520 --> 02:23:59.520]  Good pause.
[02:23:59.520 --> 02:24:01.520]  Look at this reporter.
[02:24:01.520 --> 02:24:04.520]  He looks just like the BuzzFeed reporters, like a woman that cut their hair short.
[02:24:04.520 --> 02:24:13.520]  And I'm not being mean, but they're all like little skinny zombies you've never heard of because that's who slime bags like Hillary want to be around.
[02:24:13.520 --> 02:24:15.520]  You don't want to have real men around them.
[02:24:15.520 --> 02:24:24.520]  In fact, they've had, they've had mainstream news articles saying and psychiatrists have pointed out that Hillary always wants really ugly people around her because she's ugly too.
[02:24:24.520 --> 02:24:26.520]  See, that's why misery loves company.
[02:24:26.520 --> 02:24:29.520]  But oh, uranium one, it's been debunked.
[02:24:29.520 --> 02:24:31.520]  Even the New York Times admits it's smoking gun.
[02:24:31.520 --> 02:24:35.520]  You guys have been caught red-handed, but you say it's been debunked.
[02:24:35.520 --> 02:24:37.520]  Oh, and you never had a secret server either.
[02:24:37.520 --> 02:24:38.520]  You told our reporters that.
[02:24:38.520 --> 02:24:39.520]  Oh, I never had a server.
[02:24:39.520 --> 02:24:42.520]  None of it was hacked.
[02:24:42.520 --> 02:24:44.520]  If you like your doctor, you can keep it.
[02:24:44.520 --> 02:24:46.520]  Here, let's continue.
[02:24:46.520 --> 02:25:01.520]  Members of the press by independent experts, it is nothing but a, you know, a false charge that the Trump administration is trying to drum up in order to avoid attention being directed at them.
[02:25:01.520 --> 02:25:11.520]  I mean, even Trey Gowdy, somebody who's hardly a fan of mine, said that, you know, there doesn't seem to be the basis for a special counsel.
[02:25:11.520 --> 02:25:12.520]  Of course, there isn't.
[02:25:12.520 --> 02:25:20.520]  But if I try to take myself out of it, which, you know, is kind of hard because it's personally offensive that they would do this.
[02:25:20.520 --> 02:25:28.520]  But taking myself out of it, this is such an abuse of power and it goes right at the rule of law.
[02:25:28.520 --> 02:25:29.520]  What?
[02:25:29.520 --> 02:25:35.520]  As Secretary of State, I went around the world bragging about America's rule of law, that we were a nation of law.
[02:25:35.520 --> 02:25:36.520]  Okay, what is that done?
[02:25:36.520 --> 02:25:40.520]  And, you know, the justice system was blind and obviously-
[02:25:40.520 --> 02:25:41.520]  Cut her off.
[02:25:41.520 --> 02:25:42.520]  She doesn't say anything.
[02:25:42.520 --> 02:25:43.520]  I can't listen to it.
[02:25:43.520 --> 02:25:44.520]  Here's what Trey Gowdy really said.
[02:25:44.520 --> 02:25:46.520]  Here's the clips she's talking about.
[02:25:46.520 --> 02:25:50.520]  On the issue of special counsel, I did not sign, Jim Jordan's a great friend.
[02:25:50.520 --> 02:25:52.520]  I have tremendous respect for him.
[02:25:52.520 --> 02:25:57.520]  I did not sign the letter because I don't think the threshold has been met for the appointment of special counsel.
[02:25:57.520 --> 02:25:59.520]  And I think this is a really important point.
[02:25:59.520 --> 02:26:02.520]  You can investigate something without special counsel.
[02:26:02.520 --> 02:26:10.520]  In fact, 99.9% of all investigations in this country are done by the women and men at the Department of Justice and the U.S. Attorney's offices.
[02:26:10.520 --> 02:26:13.520]  And none of them is called special counsel.
[02:26:13.520 --> 02:26:16.520]  So there's a threshold that has to be met.
[02:26:16.520 --> 02:26:18.520]  And I don't think it has been met.
[02:26:18.520 --> 02:26:24.520]  So to say we're not going to appoint special counsel is not to say we're not going to look into something.
[02:26:24.520 --> 02:26:26.520]  You're saying the threshold has not been met.
[02:26:26.520 --> 02:26:29.520]  At what point is it met?
[02:26:29.520 --> 02:26:31.520]  What do you need to get there?
[02:26:31.520 --> 02:26:33.520]  If you do get there.
[02:26:33.520 --> 02:26:45.520]  A conflict of interest where the Department of Justice and all 94 U.S. Attorney's offices are ill-suited and the public would not have confidence in an investigation that they ran.
[02:26:45.520 --> 02:26:48.520]  I mean, look at Bob Mueller was appointed special counsel.
[02:26:48.520 --> 02:26:50.520]  Some of your viewers don't have confidence in him.
[02:26:50.520 --> 02:26:55.520]  So the appointment of special counsel does not talismanically make people all of a sudden have confidence in themselves.
[02:26:55.520 --> 02:27:00.520]  I was about to say it was done because people didn't have confidence and it was done politically.
[02:27:00.520 --> 02:27:02.520]  So why do we create another political thing?
[02:27:02.520 --> 02:27:04.520]  That's what's really being said here.
[02:27:04.520 --> 02:27:07.520]  But we're getting lost here in the weeds, folks.
[02:27:07.520 --> 02:27:09.520]  They're all super guilty.
[02:27:09.520 --> 02:27:11.520]  The fact that he's saying it doesn't reach a level of special counsel.
[02:27:11.520 --> 02:27:13.520]  That means there's not public confidence.
[02:27:13.520 --> 02:27:16.520]  Well, I think there is a public confidence in the Justice Department right now.
[02:27:16.520 --> 02:27:18.520]  Actually, I disagree with you on that.
[02:27:18.520 --> 02:27:22.520]  But here's Morning Joe saying uranium one is dumb conspiracy theory.
[02:27:22.520 --> 02:27:24.520]  Oh, you didn't give the uranium.
[02:27:24.520 --> 02:27:26.520]  There was no criminal investigation.
[02:27:26.520 --> 02:27:27.520]  Mueller didn't order its hand.
[02:27:27.520 --> 02:27:28.520]  You're full of baloney.
[02:27:28.520 --> 02:27:29.520]  Here it is.
[02:27:29.520 --> 02:27:35.520]  We had an attorney general that stepped up and did not look like he was not going to allow.
[02:27:35.520 --> 02:27:41.520]  Look like he was not going to allow our president, our Republicans in Congress,
[02:27:41.520 --> 02:27:49.520]  turn this Justice Department into some device for a tyrannical autocrat to make it.
[02:27:49.520 --> 02:27:52.520]  If he listened to Donald Trump,
[02:27:52.520 --> 02:27:57.520]  this would shatter constitutional norms and would be chilling.
[02:27:57.520 --> 02:28:02.520]  President Trump and his allies have been hammering the Clinton State Department for months,
[02:28:02.520 --> 02:28:06.520]  calling the uranium one deal, quote, Watergate modern age.
[02:28:06.520 --> 02:28:09.520]  It's also been covered, which is Walter Wall on Fox News.
[02:28:09.520 --> 02:28:12.520]  That's incredible.
[02:28:12.520 --> 02:28:16.520]  Shep undercut this entire conspiracy theory.
[02:28:16.520 --> 02:28:22.520]  And the clown show.
[02:28:22.520 --> 02:28:25.520]  Because, again, you had all these agencies that had to sign off on it.
[02:28:25.520 --> 02:28:27.520]  This wasn't Hillary Clinton saying, give me money.
[02:28:27.520 --> 02:28:29.520]  I'm going to take care of this.
[02:28:29.520 --> 02:28:31.520]  Agency C control.
[02:28:31.520 --> 02:28:32.520]  Criminal investigations.
[02:28:32.520 --> 02:28:34.520]  They ordered kill.
[02:28:34.520 --> 02:28:35.520]  Gosh almighty.
[02:28:35.520 --> 02:28:38.520]  I mean, uranium deals, secret deals, transfer deals.
[02:28:38.520 --> 02:28:40.520]  And then you're talking about Donald Trump Jr.
[02:28:40.520 --> 02:28:42.520]  trying to meet to find corruption on Hillary.
[02:28:42.520 --> 02:28:43.520]  That's Russian collusion.
[02:28:43.520 --> 02:28:46.520]  But uranium transfers aren't and then buying off politicians.
[02:28:46.520 --> 02:29:15.520]  We'll be back. Stay with us.
[02:29:16.520 --> 02:29:23.520]  And for a limited time, get all plates at wholesale pricing only at catiarmor.com.

[02:32:53.520 --> 02:33:08.520]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:08.520 --> 02:33:23.520]  Coming to you from the former United States of America,
[02:33:23.520 --> 02:33:27.520]  from deep in the heart of Texas, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:27.520 --> 02:33:29.520]  All right, Millie Weaver just came in here.
[02:33:29.520 --> 02:33:33.520]  They just got back from Hillary Clinton's visit to Austin, Texas.
[02:33:33.520 --> 02:33:35.520]  We got other reporters going to her Dallas event.
[02:33:35.520 --> 02:33:38.520]  I'm sure they know that.
[02:33:38.520 --> 02:33:41.520]  Her stupid book tour of her failure of a book.
[02:33:41.520 --> 02:33:43.520]  What happened? You happened, lady.
[02:33:43.520 --> 02:33:48.520]  People woke up to you. Millie just came in and told me the footage they got.
[02:33:48.520 --> 02:33:53.520]  Now, it was Millie one week before in Cleveland, Ohio,
[02:33:53.520 --> 02:33:58.520]  one week before September 11th when Hillary fell down like one of the towers
[02:33:58.520 --> 02:34:03.520]  and fell on her face. The media tried to cover it up, but we had the footage.
[02:34:03.520 --> 02:34:05.520]  They would just show her stumble and say that was it,
[02:34:05.520 --> 02:34:08.520]  not the rest of her falling over and being thrown on the side of the black ambulance
[02:34:08.520 --> 02:34:14.520]  like a side of beef is a secret service said Millie and Gavin were following her around
[02:34:14.520 --> 02:34:19.520]  and they got her in the emergency tent for an hour and the emergency stretchers.
[02:34:19.520 --> 02:34:22.520]  We have those articles.
[02:34:22.520 --> 02:34:26.520]  In fact, here's some of the footage of Hillary falling down.
[02:34:26.520 --> 02:34:34.520]  They were at the event and they got Hillary having to be lifted out of the ambulance again.
[02:34:34.520 --> 02:34:40.520]  They had to pull her up and had to physically set her up and pull her out.
[02:34:40.520 --> 02:34:45.520]  You see them holding on to her and helping her upstairs, all that other footage.
[02:34:45.520 --> 02:34:51.520]  The weekend with Bernie's when she has these seizures from the brain tumor.
[02:34:51.520 --> 02:34:53.520]  Again, we're not supposed to know that information.
[02:34:53.520 --> 02:35:00.520]  Federal laws on medical records. So I just had a CIA source say that that should be looked into.
[02:35:00.520 --> 02:35:08.520]  The point is, is that
[02:35:08.520 --> 02:35:12.520]  they have footage of her having to be pulled out of the vehicle not being able to get up
[02:35:12.520 --> 02:35:20.520]  and they have them calling the Dallas police or Austin police Dallas next on Millie
[02:35:20.520 --> 02:35:23.520]  and the Dallas police tell their goons, leave her alone.
[02:35:23.520 --> 02:35:26.520]  She's allowed to be out here on the sidewalk. So good for the awesome cops.
[02:35:26.520 --> 02:35:30.520]  I don't know the Dallas cops will be so good because she's about to be there next.
[02:35:30.520 --> 02:35:35.520]  So this is just incredible.
[02:35:35.520 --> 02:35:39.520]  Now I want to go ahead and go to this next clip, but she's going to be coming on either next segment
[02:35:39.520 --> 02:35:43.520]  or fourth hour with myself and Mike Cernovich, but we're going to have Millie Weaver
[02:35:43.520 --> 02:35:51.520]  or Intrepid Reporter, her and Gavin just when it comes to devastating victories every time they go out.
[02:35:51.520 --> 02:35:54.520]  I mean, they've got powerful gods.
[02:35:54.520 --> 02:35:59.520]  And I don't mean that in a paganistic way. That's a quote from the show Rome on HBO,
[02:35:59.520 --> 02:36:01.520]  which is actually a real quote from Julius Caesar.
[02:36:01.520 --> 02:36:04.520]  He talked about people that kept having good success, good luck.
[02:36:04.520 --> 02:36:07.520]  They'd say, these men have powerful gods.
[02:36:07.520 --> 02:36:13.520]  And the fact that good luck, gods on their side, the forces with them, they just every time they go out,
[02:36:13.520 --> 02:36:17.520]  it's just fantastical what they get.
[02:36:17.520 --> 02:36:21.520]  So very, very awesome to have them on the team.
[02:36:21.520 --> 02:36:24.520]  They just continually get really powerful stuff.
[02:36:24.520 --> 02:36:28.520]  So again, this is just them trying to block.
[02:36:28.520 --> 02:36:30.520]  So you can't see, but they've got the footage.
[02:36:30.520 --> 02:36:35.520]  They're blowing it up right now where they're picking her up and getting her up,
[02:36:35.520 --> 02:36:44.520]  which is what the Secret Service told us one month before she collapsed on September 11th last year.
[02:36:44.520 --> 02:36:51.520]  One month before they told us that, listen, we don't know what's wrong with her.
[02:36:51.520 --> 02:36:54.520]  You're the one that has guests on about a brain tumor.
[02:36:54.520 --> 02:36:57.520]  All we know is she's having convulsions every 45 minutes or so.
[02:36:57.520 --> 02:36:59.520]  She's got a black ambulance.
[02:36:59.520 --> 02:37:01.520]  It's got lift gates on it on the back of the front.
[02:37:01.520 --> 02:37:03.520]  They've got clinic things set up.
[02:37:03.520 --> 02:37:06.520]  She's having these convulsions all the time.
[02:37:06.520 --> 02:37:08.520]  And that's all we're going to tell you.
[02:37:08.520 --> 02:37:10.520]  So just tell everybody, follow her around.
[02:37:10.520 --> 02:37:12.520]  You'll get it.
[02:37:12.520 --> 02:37:15.520]  Well, we got her at the emergency tent the week before in Cleveland.
[02:37:15.520 --> 02:37:19.520]  This Dutch video guy, he was a fan.
[02:37:19.520 --> 02:37:21.520]  He just got back there and caught it.
[02:37:21.520 --> 02:37:22.520]  So the Secret Service was right.
[02:37:22.520 --> 02:37:24.520]  We were proven right again from our sources.
[02:37:24.520 --> 02:37:27.520]  It happened.
[02:37:27.520 --> 02:37:32.520]  Just like we told you, the reported main shooter in the Vegas thing, Patek.
[02:37:32.520 --> 02:37:37.520]  Had gone to the Middle East with his girlfriend and had a visitor and was there days earlier
[02:37:37.520 --> 02:37:40.520]  and had Islamic paraphernalia and Antifa.
[02:37:40.520 --> 02:37:45.520]  That all came out later except for the Antifa part.
[02:37:45.520 --> 02:37:48.520]  Because, I mean, we got that directly from them.
[02:37:48.520 --> 02:37:50.520]  People said, well, wait, I thought the FBI's corrupt.
[02:37:50.520 --> 02:37:54.520]  But then you're saying the Haas's rescue team, they're not all corrupt.
[02:37:54.520 --> 02:37:57.520]  A fish rots from the head.
[02:37:57.520 --> 02:38:02.520]  Crap rolls downhill.
[02:38:02.520 --> 02:38:06.520]  I mean, you're in there and you see all this Islamic stuff and you know where Patek's been.
[02:38:06.520 --> 02:38:09.520]  You've got his MO.
[02:38:09.520 --> 02:38:13.520]  You want to tell people you don't see gun owners being blamed.
[02:38:13.520 --> 02:38:20.520]  Because the guys that actually do the shooting and the FBI, they're former military or current military or patriots.
[02:38:20.520 --> 02:38:24.520]  They don't like the politicos always getting away with murder.
[02:38:24.520 --> 02:38:27.520]  I haven't even hit on the nose. I mean, it's usually such big topics.
[02:38:27.520 --> 02:38:30.520]  I literally sit here like 200 articles probably.
[02:38:30.520 --> 02:38:35.520]  I bet if I count all these articles up, I bet there's 200 conservatively.
[02:38:35.520 --> 02:38:37.520]  I mean, just the stacks like 15.
[02:38:37.520 --> 02:38:43.520]  So 15, 15, 45, 65, 70.
[02:38:43.520 --> 02:38:45.520]  Oh yeah, it's well over.
[02:38:45.520 --> 02:38:46.520]  Maybe 120.
[02:38:46.520 --> 02:38:47.520]  A little bit like today.
[02:38:47.520 --> 02:38:48.520]  Sometimes I have 200, 300.
[02:38:48.520 --> 02:38:49.520]  I don't know.
[02:38:49.520 --> 02:38:50.520]  This is a big stack.
[02:38:50.520 --> 02:38:52.520]  That's like 30 articles.
[02:38:52.520 --> 02:38:57.520]  The point is, is that I don't have all the answers.
[02:38:57.520 --> 02:38:59.520]  We've got social engineers.
[02:38:59.520 --> 02:39:01.520]  They admit they're doing this to us.
[02:39:01.520 --> 02:39:02.520]  They only operate in the dark.
[02:39:02.520 --> 02:39:03.520]  They operate with our tax money.
[02:39:03.520 --> 02:39:07.520]  They operate with corporate jurisdiction offshore that are above the law.
[02:39:07.520 --> 02:39:10.520]  They got thousands of labs, human animal chimeras.
[02:39:10.520 --> 02:39:12.520]  Hell, that's 35 years old.
[02:39:12.520 --> 02:39:18.520]  Who knows what they've got now?
[02:39:18.520 --> 02:39:22.520]  All I know is all they talk about in public reports is how they want to get rid of the
[02:39:22.520 --> 02:39:26.520]  majority of the public, how we're a bunch of weevils eating up their planet.
[02:39:26.520 --> 02:39:35.520]  And I'm like, listen, buddy, I'm going to tell people about this.
[02:39:35.520 --> 02:39:37.520]  And it's not because I'm some hero.
[02:39:37.520 --> 02:39:40.520]  They're trying to make me take vaccines and my kids.
[02:39:40.520 --> 02:39:42.520]  And I know they're jacking with them.
[02:39:42.520 --> 02:39:44.520]  It's called self-preservation.
[02:39:44.520 --> 02:39:48.520]  When I see somebody else in a car wreck get out with their face smashed, bleeding.
[02:39:48.520 --> 02:39:52.520]  I have empathy because I know what that feels like.
[02:39:52.520 --> 02:39:55.520]  I know it could be my kids in that wreck.
[02:39:55.520 --> 02:39:59.520]  The fact that I got nerve endings doesn't mean I'm a wimp.
[02:39:59.520 --> 02:40:00.520]  It's the opposite.
[02:40:00.520 --> 02:40:06.520]  I've got feelings because that's how you get through the world is having feelings.
[02:40:06.520 --> 02:40:08.520]  Being connected.
[02:40:08.520 --> 02:40:13.520]  The globalists work to not have feelings and to become psychopaths or sociopaths.
[02:40:13.520 --> 02:40:14.520]  It's a joke.
[02:40:14.520 --> 02:40:15.520]  And I'm tired of these people.
[02:40:15.520 --> 02:40:17.520]  I don't like them.
[02:40:17.520 --> 02:40:18.520]  They don't produce wealth.
[02:40:18.520 --> 02:40:20.520]  They don't produce longevity.
[02:40:20.520 --> 02:40:23.520]  They don't produce anything but baloney like North Korea.
[02:40:23.520 --> 02:40:26.520]  And you know what I'm going to do?
[02:40:26.520 --> 02:40:31.520]  One way or another, the water doesn't rise over Bear Creek or the air doesn't lift the admiral.
[02:40:31.520 --> 02:40:38.520]  I am going to shoot a special video about Trump's speech in South Korea because if I just air it, it's 30 minutes long.
[02:40:38.520 --> 02:40:39.520]  It's powerful.
[02:40:39.520 --> 02:40:50.520]  But if I show images and documents and clips and make it like 45 minutes an hour long, where he builds up South Korea and shows how they're like one of the most successful countries in the world,
[02:40:50.520 --> 02:40:53.520]  per capita for the average person, the biggest middle class.
[02:40:53.520 --> 02:40:55.520]  I mean, it's just amazing.
[02:40:55.520 --> 02:40:58.520]  They have the highest rate of autism, though, because they're very dutiful.
[02:40:58.520 --> 02:40:59.520]  They take all their vaccines.
[02:40:59.520 --> 02:41:01.520]  They do whatever America says.
[02:41:01.520 --> 02:41:03.520]  Well, that means the corrupt interests that are in America.
[02:41:03.520 --> 02:41:06.520]  I mean, America's perfect or great or the best or the worst.
[02:41:06.520 --> 02:41:07.520]  We're amazing.
[02:41:07.520 --> 02:41:09.520]  But we're not one thing.
[02:41:09.520 --> 02:41:10.520]  We're amazingly good.
[02:41:10.520 --> 02:41:13.520]  We're amazingly bad.
[02:41:13.520 --> 02:41:14.520]  We're looking forward.
[02:41:14.520 --> 02:41:15.520]  We're looking backward.
[02:41:15.520 --> 02:41:16.520]  We're looking all around.
[02:41:16.520 --> 02:41:18.520]  But freedom comes with that.
[02:41:18.520 --> 02:41:21.520]  A lot of choices, a lot of good, a lot of bad, a lot of in between.
[02:41:21.520 --> 02:41:32.520]  But he just lays out how they are compared to the North, how it's two different universes completely and how authoritarianism versus independence and the individual is two different universes.
[02:41:32.520 --> 02:41:40.520]  And how the secrets of the universe must be unlocked by the individual mind and the individual inventor from the lowliest to the highest.
[02:41:40.520 --> 02:41:42.520]  And that's what's going to empower us into the future.
[02:41:42.520 --> 02:41:47.520]  It is an incredible speech.
[02:41:47.520 --> 02:41:55.520]  And it documents the difference between free market and communism, authoritarianism and libertarianism.
[02:41:55.520 --> 02:41:57.520]  Just briefly.
[02:41:57.520 --> 02:42:06.520]  If you don't buy the products we've got at InfoWars store, the probiotics, the digestive enzymes, carnivore, it's so amazing what it does for you.
[02:42:06.520 --> 02:42:08.520]  Get all the nutrients, break it, stuff down.
[02:42:08.520 --> 02:42:10.520]  You can take all the vitamins and minerals you want.
[02:42:10.520 --> 02:42:13.520]  So if you don't have the digestive enzymes, you don't actually get it out of there.
[02:42:13.520 --> 02:42:14.520]  Carnivore is a new product.
[02:42:14.520 --> 02:42:20.520]  And InfoWarsLife.com goes along with our two new fluorolife daily dietary support.
[02:42:20.520 --> 02:42:23.520]  They also have the advanced digestive support.
[02:42:23.520 --> 02:42:24.520]  Got a bunch of great products.
[02:42:24.520 --> 02:42:31.520]  The digestive enzymes, carnivore, the 15 billion everyday maintenance, 15 billion live probiotic from fluorolife.
[02:42:31.520 --> 02:42:35.520]  And then fluorolife, advanced restoration, 50 billion live probiotics.
[02:42:35.520 --> 02:42:36.520]  It's all there.
[02:42:36.520 --> 02:42:37.520]  Free shipping goes to the weekend.
[02:42:37.520 --> 02:42:38.520]  Got a lot of new specials.
[02:42:38.520 --> 02:42:39.520]  The old specials had to end.
[02:42:39.520 --> 02:42:44.520]  We have new specials that are about to end on vitamin mineral fusion, on caveman and more.

[02:44:53.520 --> 02:44:58.520]  Dr. Group, you developed Living Defense for us. It took you over a year to do it. Why is this so good?
[02:44:58.520 --> 02:45:03.520]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[02:45:03.520 --> 02:45:09.520]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in my system.
[02:45:09.520 --> 02:45:17.520]  But right now we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism.
[02:45:17.520 --> 02:45:23.520]  Right now with all the refugees spreading disease around, we have biological warfare going on everywhere.
[02:45:23.520 --> 02:45:25.520]  These are all parasites.
[02:45:25.520 --> 02:45:27.520]  Tell us about all the stuff that's in it. There's so many things that are in it.
[02:45:27.520 --> 02:45:31.520]  You have the neem in there, you have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood.
[02:45:31.520 --> 02:45:35.520]  I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[02:45:35.520 --> 02:45:38.520]  Alright, well I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today.

[02:46:56.160 --> 02:47:16.760]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[02:47:16.760 --> 02:47:41.560]  So CNN goes on to say investigating the Clintons is what happens in an authoritarian country
[02:47:41.560 --> 02:48:06.640]  and
[02:48:06.640 --> 02:48:10.240]  with Hillary here in Austin and where she was and what happened to her having to be picked up
[02:48:10.240 --> 02:48:14.800]  and propped up and brought in new footage of this them trying to have the cops go after our
[02:48:14.800 --> 02:48:20.320]  reporters the cops said no you leave them alone so a lot of good things happening there people
[02:48:20.320 --> 02:48:25.520]  know the enemy is don't worry but right now let's go ahead and go to this clip seeing and
[02:48:25.520 --> 02:48:28.640]  investigating Clinton is what happens in an authoritarian country
[02:48:28.640 --> 02:48:39.520]  now we've got some technical problems here let's let's stop it i'll be good to have that
[02:48:39.520 --> 02:48:44.640]  occasionally happen um you guys want to try to reload it or just say it's not there i'm cool
[02:48:44.640 --> 02:48:51.040]  either way this happens on live tv so that clip's not working i've been wanting to play that one
[02:48:51.040 --> 02:48:54.720]  that's a really good one let's let's redownload that one let's go ahead go to the next one dealing
[02:48:54.720 --> 02:49:01.520]  with the uh joe stahl and stuff so here's that clip first of all we're gonna get how horrific this
[02:49:01.520 --> 02:49:09.600]  is uh what a horrific president this would set if donald trump goes after his political opponent
[02:49:09.600 --> 02:49:13.920]  this way uses the justice department pressures the justice department pressures the attorney general
[02:49:13.920 --> 02:49:20.400]  to do this this is this is what happens uh this is what joseph stahl and would do uh this is uh
[02:49:20.400 --> 02:49:27.440]  what what tyrants have done for years is sick their uh their people on political opponents
[02:49:27.440 --> 02:49:34.400]  but it's just the underlying charge uh the claim here that somehow the clinton's benefited
[02:49:34.400 --> 02:49:40.640]  from this still going through it's an absence of malice moment where you know
[02:49:42.080 --> 02:49:46.960]  poll Newman leads back in his chair and says prove it they're not gonna they're not gonna
[02:49:46.960 --> 02:49:52.400]  prove anything here there's no smoking gun here there's no nothing here that's going to prove
[02:49:53.040 --> 02:50:02.080]  that the clinton somehow uh got money i mean it might look bad but putting a special
[02:50:02.960 --> 02:50:07.120]  there's going to uncover this is so pathetic instead of horrific precedent you don't think
[02:50:07.120 --> 02:50:13.680]  there have been times in in this troubled uh presidency that people have stood stood up and
[02:50:13.680 --> 02:50:18.560]  actually put the constitutional republic first you saw that we've got sessions accusing himself
[02:50:18.560 --> 02:50:23.680]  because it was the right thing to do you saw that with rod resenstein we're accusing himself and
[02:50:23.680 --> 02:50:30.080]  appointing uh bob muller because that was the right thing to do and in doing that those matters
[02:50:30.080 --> 02:50:35.920]  everything else these guys have done or will do those were shining moments where they put the
[02:50:35.920 --> 02:50:42.160]  country and the constitution first now it's game on in the justice department and it's time what about
[02:50:42.160 --> 02:50:47.360]  that dead end turn in your office justice department you do the same thing stand up for the rule of law
[02:50:47.360 --> 02:50:51.760]  stand up for the constitution of the united oh sure always trying to destroy constitutional norms
[02:50:51.760 --> 02:50:55.280]  and by the way look at just car bro you know i don't believe he's really an alien from mars but
[02:50:55.280 --> 02:50:59.680]  in mars attack the girl has the b i have air cut because she's really an alien i mean is he really
[02:50:59.680 --> 02:51:04.880]  an alien gray let's put him back on screen i'm being sarcastic these are saying jones believes
[02:51:04.880 --> 02:51:12.000]  carbo is an alien just what a bozo the clown and then you've got mika brazinski and her war criminal
[02:51:12.000 --> 02:51:17.360]  father you know sitting there and and it's like it may look bad they got money from the russians
[02:51:17.360 --> 02:51:21.600]  and gave them all the uranium but they got the government to say it was legal under obama so
[02:51:21.600 --> 02:51:28.800]  it's okay and then they had the fbi killing investigation he just sits up there bumbling
[02:51:28.800 --> 02:51:36.720]  this is what you get when a dead entrance found in your place and then forever after your justice
[02:51:36.720 --> 02:51:42.080]  creature look how pathetic they all look i mean almost no one even watches these shows
[02:51:43.920 --> 02:51:50.880]  and now he's going with this david brock look where he has this big bozo haired i am from mars
[02:51:50.880 --> 02:51:57.840]  i am here playing his arms and we're just supposed to bow down to this guy i'm so sick of him pathetic
[02:51:57.840 --> 02:52:07.520]  oh look at this little schnibbler of news polosi soros headline anti trump dark money conference
[02:52:09.280 --> 02:52:13.440]  that's up on news wars dot com the democracy alliance you know they're not funding the air
[02:52:13.440 --> 02:52:18.000]  of spring or overthrowing the iranian government trying to cross the race war a dark money
[02:52:18.000 --> 02:52:24.080]  organization of prominent far-left donors that have all pledged to funnel money to approve left
[02:52:24.080 --> 02:52:29.360]  wing groups to resist president trump close quote travel to california's lakosa resort
[02:52:30.560 --> 02:52:36.000]  wednesday to attend their three-day fall summit with polosi soros each set to give speeches
[02:52:37.360 --> 02:52:41.680]  that's the news wars headline on it but notice seven of the ten richest members of congress
[02:52:41.680 --> 02:52:46.240]  are democrats yeah i've seen the statistics the democrats have five times the wealth of the
[02:52:46.240 --> 02:52:54.320]  republicans and congress just like all the top globalists warren buffett bill gates
[02:52:54.320 --> 02:53:02.320]  jeff bezos ted turner just all of them are democrats because they're globalists they
[02:53:02.320 --> 02:53:07.680]  want to wreck everything takeover flood us with cheap labor tax exempt but they want to raise
[02:53:07.680 --> 02:53:12.320]  taxes all day so there's more middle-class money because they get bailouts and stuff warren buffett
[02:53:12.320 --> 02:53:21.920]  biggest recipient of the 2008 bailout 487 billion dollars that his company and he got he got something
[02:53:21.920 --> 02:53:29.520]  like 50 i put the mcclatchy headline it'll save us some you know he got 50 plus billion himself
[02:53:29.520 --> 02:53:37.440]  in one day i'd buy that for a dollar boy i'm glad he's a liberal hey i get all your tax money and
[02:53:37.440 --> 02:53:43.200]  fun third-world slave factories but as long as i say i'm liberal look i he always poses because he
[02:53:43.200 --> 02:53:51.760]  owns dairy queen with an ice cream cone so there you go you tell the average let this you know
[02:53:51.760 --> 02:53:55.440]  the really rich people are for globalism and are leftist because they don't want you to have any
[02:53:55.440 --> 02:54:03.280]  money or any future now shut up you kkk remember i heard tom brokaw say you were a nazi really did
[02:54:03.280 --> 02:54:08.720]  tom brokaw show a clip of that no because tom brokaw is a joke he looks just like george
[02:54:08.720 --> 02:54:18.480]  ruby and bush now he's like uh tom brokaw here hey i got a word racist he's a racist right over here
[02:54:21.040 --> 02:54:26.480]  but oh not tom brokaw dun dun dun it's it's kind of like a gladiator they've he's already
[02:54:26.480 --> 02:54:32.480]  beaten all the other gladiators so they bring a guy out of retirement from gall and he's like you
[02:54:32.480 --> 02:54:36.720]  know dun dun dun then they got like six tigers after him and this guy they still can't beat him
[02:54:36.720 --> 02:54:41.200]  so like out of the but for me out of the gladiatorial deal comes tom brokaw they had
[02:54:42.960 --> 02:54:47.760]  the other one come out of retirement ted koppel it's like if you grow up watching these guys like
[02:54:47.760 --> 02:54:54.640]  they're like cryptkeepers yeah i'm here to defeat you it's like oh my gosh if he calls me a

[02:55:09.760 --> 02:55:20.560]  looked at george w bush has this oh i'm somebody here oh all right they did get the clip in trapping
[02:55:20.560 --> 02:55:26.560]  crew here's here's a clip of them saying um seeing an investigating clinton is what happens
[02:55:26.560 --> 02:55:31.440]  in authoritarian countries they're investigating trump made up crap shut down the press arrest
[02:55:31.440 --> 02:55:37.760]  alex shows but when we say investigate them oh that's authoritarianism here it is but you have
[02:55:37.760 --> 02:55:43.280]  to also do it in context back november 22nd that's kwomo remember you we're allowed to read with
[02:55:43.280 --> 02:55:48.160]  elix he said you're not and if you do we'll arrest you sorry let me get back to kwomo he also said
[02:55:48.160 --> 02:55:55.040]  let your daughter shower with men and let them see their genitals or your sexist you're against
[02:55:55.040 --> 02:56:00.480]  trance he said that so back to the guy that uh thinks that full grown men should shower with
[02:56:00.480 --> 02:56:06.240]  your 12 year old honors areas you have to also do it in context back to november 22nd after the
[02:56:06.240 --> 02:56:09.840]  election the president was asked about this so you're gonna go after the clinton's because you
[02:56:09.840 --> 02:56:13.920]  kept saying you were going to do it all during the election here's what he said he's always had
[02:56:14.880 --> 02:56:20.000]  well when it goes up already so look i want to move forward i don't want to move back
[02:56:20.000 --> 02:56:25.040]  and i don't want to hurt the clinton's i really don't she went through a lot and suffered greatly
[02:56:25.040 --> 02:56:28.960]  in many different ways and i'm not looking to hurt them at all that's him trying to be gracious
[02:56:28.960 --> 02:56:35.200]  so that's where this started now by the way pause i told him days before that they're gonna play
[02:56:35.200 --> 02:56:41.600]  pause and then come at your neck sir and i told him about about 10 more times and now the president
[02:56:41.600 --> 02:56:45.680]  does listen to what i say even more because every bit of it came through sorry let's go back to
[02:56:45.680 --> 02:56:50.560]  cobalt well because of what's been going on with him jeffrey tuban do we see a very different
[02:56:50.560 --> 02:56:56.400]  posture now being motivated by the u.s. department of justice you know i i don't want to be uh
[02:56:56.400 --> 02:57:01.440]  chicken little but you know what this is what happens in authoritarian countries like turkey
[02:57:01.440 --> 02:57:07.360]  and russia that when a party takes power they start criminally investigating their opponents
[02:57:07.360 --> 02:57:11.200]  i mean that's what this is that's what you've been doing to trump what hasn't happened as you
[02:57:11.200 --> 02:57:16.960]  just pointed out chris but you know we're talking about the clinton foundation back in the nineties

[02:59:55.520 --> 03:00:02.720]  gentlemen thanksgiving one of the few true americana holidays that we've got probably my favorite
[03:00:02.720 --> 03:00:10.720]  holiday the 23rd day of november 2017 we've seen total demonization of the italian christopher
[03:00:10.720 --> 03:00:17.280]  columbus we've seen the total demonization of thanksgiving we've seen attempts to get rid of
[03:00:17.280 --> 03:00:25.440]  the holiday to use it to cast aspersions on western civilization and western expansion that
[03:00:25.440 --> 03:00:32.640]  undoubtedly was a mess and there were crimes on all sides when i say all sides it wasn't just the
[03:00:32.640 --> 03:00:38.240]  settlers or it wasn't just the troops or it wasn't just the empires or it wasn't just all the different
[03:00:38.240 --> 03:00:46.960]  native tribes it was all of those different countless changing factions that played into this
[03:00:46.960 --> 03:00:55.440]  long before colonized north america the viking certainly visited for a thousand years before
[03:00:55.440 --> 03:01:02.480]  christopher columbus supposedly discovered it that's now documented but long before white men
[03:01:02.480 --> 03:01:09.040]  ever colonized it all the native tribes did was run around and try to dominate and control each
[03:01:09.040 --> 03:01:16.640]  other and take over and kill the men and then take the women and the children the same stuff that
[03:01:16.640 --> 03:01:22.560]  was going on in europe for 10 000 years same stuff going on in africa for 10 000 years the same
[03:01:22.560 --> 03:01:31.920]  stuff going on everywhere in the world humans acted the same and so we never see big pieces
[03:01:31.920 --> 03:01:37.600]  being done on the bad things that the native americans did or you know the way they behaved
[03:01:37.600 --> 03:01:44.240]  because it's not part of the liberation theology starting in the fifties the ford foundation the
[03:01:44.240 --> 03:01:49.360]  carnage endowment created liberation theology where they thought talked that jesus would have
[03:01:50.480 --> 03:01:56.640]  you know fought back it was a revolutionary and hated capitalism it was a communist and so they got
[03:01:58.080 --> 03:02:04.320]  the different populations that were christian poor black hispanic you name it to become liberation
[03:02:04.320 --> 03:02:08.480]  theologists and that was just one part of it but to teach then the schools to everybody that
[03:02:08.480 --> 03:02:14.080]  america was bad the founders were bad this was an undermining of the nation state and our
[03:02:14.080 --> 03:02:21.920]  ethos where we came from so that people of color particularly wouldn't have a idea in their head
[03:02:21.920 --> 03:02:28.000]  that they had a right to the american birthright or that they'd been part critical parts of this
[03:02:28.000 --> 03:02:34.640]  great saga no it's all just you were good but you were exploited and the whites were bad
[03:02:34.640 --> 03:02:40.240]  when it was way more complex with whites that were religious servants and bounties and people
[03:02:40.240 --> 03:02:47.680]  basically as slaves and company stores and sharecroppers but they just continue to play on
[03:02:47.680 --> 03:02:52.160]  the incredible ignorance of the public the last few weeks cnn claims they've broken the news that
[03:02:52.160 --> 03:02:59.680]  they're slave auctions in libya broken the news in seven different muslim countries they sell women
[03:03:00.560 --> 03:03:06.800]  on top slave blocks you know up on a stage and it's all known it's muslims doing it but all
[03:03:06.800 --> 03:03:11.680]  these reports from cnn breaking you know this supposed news that we've been talking about
[03:03:11.680 --> 03:03:18.400]  forever and others have been documenting it's about oh the poor migrants the poor babies the poor
[03:03:18.960 --> 03:03:24.480]  the poor migrants these are people in africa that are being kidnapped and grabbed and sold
[03:03:24.480 --> 03:03:30.400]  into slavery by muslims but somehow they turn it into quote muslims by using the term migrant
[03:03:30.400 --> 03:03:35.520]  that's the new definition of muslims is a migrant never a muslim invader so they take muslims
[03:03:35.520 --> 03:03:41.360]  of slaving people and then turn it into the catchall word of poor little muslims which is migrant
[03:03:42.880 --> 03:03:46.560]  so they know what they're doing ladies and gentlemen but we're going to be covering
[03:03:46.560 --> 03:03:50.960]  that a lot more here during the transmission but i'm proud of thanksgiving and i give thanks to you

[03:05:15.760 --> 03:05:21.360]  taken over not just this country but other nations and globalism is a completely anti-individual
[03:05:21.360 --> 03:05:31.120]  anti-god anti-family anti-christian cancer that is just pure power cult will to dominate
[03:05:31.120 --> 03:05:37.200]  and control society and that we have come so far with god's help and have turned the tide but the
[03:05:37.200 --> 03:05:42.480]  enemy's tracking back so just please we should all be so thankful to god and thankful to each other
[03:05:42.480 --> 03:05:48.240]  for taking action but also girt ourselves and get ready for the next big fight ahead because
[03:05:48.240 --> 03:06:00.560]  history is happening so for myself and my family god bless you all have a great thanksgiving

[03:06:11.920 --> 03:06:19.920]  jones
[03:06:22.480 --> 03:06:26.400]  okay mike started with his co-hosting with us in this fourth hour we're getting him connected
[03:06:26.400 --> 03:06:31.840]  right now the footage you're about to see is really important because we're gonna have even
[03:06:31.840 --> 03:06:36.080]  more footage this just happened like an hour ago millie weaver and gabin wins the camera guy
[03:06:36.080 --> 03:06:40.240]  both of them and trevin reporters just got back to the mothership here in austin texas
[03:06:40.240 --> 03:06:44.080]  hillary was here in austin today millie we were our reporter we'll give you the details
[03:06:44.080 --> 03:06:49.040]  she's also going to be up in dallas now and we first got the reports from the secret service
[03:06:49.040 --> 03:06:54.240]  last year uh that hillary was having convulsions every 45 minutes and had a black ambulance and
[03:06:54.240 --> 03:06:59.200]  that we should tell our listeners and everybody else to follow her around and get her on video
[03:06:59.200 --> 03:07:03.440]  that she had a medical tent as well well a couple weeks later millie and gabin in cleveland
[03:07:03.440 --> 03:07:07.600]  ohio caught her in a medical tent for an hour emergency stretchers people running through
[03:07:07.600 --> 03:07:12.320]  we have that video a week later on september 11th a month after we broke this news that she
[03:07:12.320 --> 03:07:17.280]  was having convulsions every 45 minutes she fell down on 9 11 in new york the media only
[03:07:17.280 --> 03:07:23.280]  showed her wobbling didn't show the fall and said we made it up but despite the fact they
[03:07:23.280 --> 03:07:27.440]  pulled it off the internet the video kept getting uploaded they had to back off that was a real
[03:07:27.440 --> 03:07:31.600]  waterloo for mainstream media so you went down there today i don't know if you're wearing your
[03:07:31.600 --> 03:07:36.480]  bill clinton rape shirt i was i most definitely was and i triggered a lot of people you would not
[03:07:36.480 --> 03:07:42.640]  even believe there were a lot of um austin liberals out there lined up to see hillary clinton and
[03:07:42.640 --> 03:07:47.680]  she was very secretive and elusive you know when she even first pulled up they had a garage that
[03:07:47.680 --> 03:07:53.440]  would shut so that you wouldn't capture or see her getting out of her car as to maybe hide if
[03:07:53.440 --> 03:07:59.920]  she were to stumble or fall you you never know but it was very handled you had her whole staff
[03:07:59.920 --> 03:08:05.760]  there like a bunch of cult members and yes i did get harassed by her staff um they were stalking
[03:08:05.760 --> 03:08:10.400]  me falling me around one of the private security was even pushing up into me and i had had to keep
[03:08:10.400 --> 03:08:14.640]  telling him stop i do not want you touching me by the way by next hour you guys just got back
[03:08:14.640 --> 03:08:18.240]  in the last 45 minutes you'll have all the video downloaded and ready for the war room of though
[03:08:18.240 --> 03:08:23.360]  and shroyer you're gonna be able to show all this uh but you tell me that they call the austin cops
[03:08:23.360 --> 03:08:28.000]  but the austin cops when they got there what happened yeah i was like please call the police
[03:08:28.000 --> 03:08:32.880]  we're on a public sidewalk i'm allowed to be here talking to people that consent to talk with me
[03:08:32.880 --> 03:08:37.840]  and guess what they brought the police and the police were totally cordial and they ended up
[03:08:37.840 --> 03:08:44.240]  telling hillary's psychotic staff cult member staff to back off to you can't be in my space you
[03:08:44.240 --> 03:08:48.480]  can't be touching me and pushing your body up against me yeah this is texas and i'm sorry to
[03:08:48.480 --> 03:08:52.240]  say i didn't new york where the police a lot of times will actually back the democrats you know
[03:08:52.240 --> 03:08:56.400]  being anti-free speech of course the people can't see it on on radio but you have the
[03:08:56.400 --> 03:09:03.760]  rape shirt down there of bill clinton which became iconic in the election and uh we had the contest
[03:09:03.760 --> 03:09:07.600]  exposing bill clinton's a rapist that probably turned the tide of the election it was our audience
[03:09:07.600 --> 03:09:12.960]  taking action that did that but alone you having her coming out of a deal and then holding her up
[03:09:12.960 --> 03:09:17.360]  and holding her by the arms clearly not just guiding her but holding her up thinking she may
[03:09:17.360 --> 03:09:22.240]  fall any minute fits into the photos of her being helped at the stairs or her falling down her face
[03:09:22.240 --> 03:09:27.600]  or her being helped out of the vehicle or or or in the vehicle and donald brazil saying
[03:09:27.600 --> 03:09:32.000]  they looked at replacing her with joe biden because of her health and you know they had people
[03:09:32.000 --> 03:09:36.720]  stopping the front of the line from coming into the building so they were waiting for hillary
[03:09:36.720 --> 03:09:42.160]  to get out of her vehicle so that they can then have her stumble her way into her chair in her
[03:09:42.160 --> 03:09:47.600]  seat and then allow people in so that she could be sitting in a stationary position while she's
[03:09:47.600 --> 03:09:53.440]  signing and autographing books and essentially you know we're seeing somebody having to literally
[03:09:53.440 --> 03:09:58.400]  lift her it looks like the guy is lifting her up out of the car and again they tried to hide
[03:09:58.400 --> 03:10:02.400]  around the corner they tried to hide inside where they parked her they're being very very
[03:10:02.400 --> 03:10:08.160]  sacred of it just like the secret service told us there is a black ambulance vehicle
[03:10:08.160 --> 03:10:15.360]  that she uses now have we gotten uh mike sardvich on yet okay great because i want to get
[03:10:15.360 --> 03:10:20.400]  mike sardvich's take on this uh before we go to the footage he's supposed to be
[03:10:20.400 --> 03:10:24.480]  hosting the shower i appreciate him letting us run into what he's doing at sardvich on twitter
[03:10:25.120 --> 03:10:30.240]  mike we've been on this from day one obviously we see the whole collapse of their structure
[03:10:30.240 --> 03:10:34.000]  the elite turning against the clintons you're going to be getting into all that coming up
[03:10:34.000 --> 03:10:38.320]  but what do you make of the new footage we've got that we're about to premiere of them clearly
[03:10:38.320 --> 03:10:43.360]  hiding her around the corner and trying to hold her up under her arm you know like like she can't
[03:10:43.360 --> 03:10:48.320]  walk by herself by itself you'd say yeah but you added to all the other evidence this is amazing
[03:10:50.160 --> 03:10:56.800]  yeah and then she she broke her foot by tripping down the stairs the multiple falls the scooby
[03:10:56.800 --> 03:11:02.240]  van people can go back and see that you and i and others had talked about the scooby van
[03:11:02.240 --> 03:11:07.680]  and they call this of course a conspiracy theory and even worse but that was from secret service
[03:11:07.680 --> 03:11:13.520]  sourcing everybody knows within her because again it's all a drill it's all orchestrated
[03:11:14.560 --> 03:11:18.480]  well that's right and even at her campaign events the last few months last year they would
[03:11:19.360 --> 03:11:24.400]  all circle her and the crowd was in on it i mean we now learn we were vindicated this is true
[03:11:24.400 --> 03:11:30.320]  this is happening you know donna brazil also talked about how cult like hillary clinton's staff is
[03:11:30.320 --> 03:11:34.880]  and i can attest to you that i've been to multiple rallies multiple clinton speaking events they're
[03:11:34.880 --> 03:11:39.280]  extremely cult like and even today they were cult like in the way they harass me stalk me told me
[03:11:39.280 --> 03:11:44.000]  i needed to leave while i'm on a public sidewalk they're cult like just like donna brazil said
[03:11:44.000 --> 03:11:48.800]  so why wouldn't donna brazil's testimony on hillary clinton's ill health also be correct
[03:11:49.760 --> 03:11:54.720]  and again if you're a tv viewer we are rolling this video here uh and we have it slowed down
[03:11:54.720 --> 03:12:00.400]  there she is literally it looks like being held up her arm and then she's like oh look there's
[03:12:00.400 --> 03:12:04.640]  cameras so they take their hand off do you see they're shutting the gates they were trying to shut the
[03:12:04.640 --> 03:12:10.720]  gates and hide her completely walking into the event they did not want people getting paid i haven't
[03:12:10.720 --> 03:12:16.640]  even seen this yet it's brand new you're seeing it for the first time wow yeah no i thought because
[03:12:16.640 --> 03:12:21.520]  i saw earlier on twitter that hillary had still been traveling in her big scooby van and they
[03:12:21.520 --> 03:12:27.680]  were walking her behind the van while a bunch of fans were surrounding her and as you know that
[03:12:27.680 --> 03:12:32.400]  that was standard operating procedure was they would say never let anybody get her get her on
[03:12:32.400 --> 03:12:35.920]  by the way where is that on twitter mike is that at sternovich did you retweet that if we want to
[03:12:35.920 --> 03:12:40.320]  show that right now to give us different angles of what happened show it tells where to go yeah
[03:12:40.320 --> 03:12:46.800]  yeah so jack was so big had that on his twitter account where um it shows hillary being escorted
[03:12:46.800 --> 03:12:52.080]  to the back of her big scooby van and i thought that was a video we were talking about because as
[03:12:52.080 --> 03:12:59.360]  we know the um the media doesn't go behind the van because that's when they have to lift her up and
[03:12:59.360 --> 03:13:04.320]  prop her up so if you ever watch footage of her getting into the van they always escort her to
[03:13:04.320 --> 03:13:08.960]  the other side away from the camera sure and you see them in the shot as they're trying to close
[03:13:08.960 --> 03:13:13.120]  the gate she's like hey look and they're holding her up and then they take their hand off i mean
[03:13:13.120 --> 03:13:19.120]  this is she is really ill yeah yeah exactly so yeah i didn't even i hadn't even seen that video i
[03:13:19.120 --> 03:13:23.760]  thought you were talking about this other video that i'm looking for and i'll retweet so that
[03:13:23.760 --> 03:13:28.720]  it's at the top is yeah this this is startling actually can we watch that video yes let's roll
[03:13:28.720 --> 03:13:33.120]  that video again for tv viewers radio listeners in full wars dot com forward slash show this was
[03:13:33.120 --> 03:13:38.320]  literally shot like an hour and a half ago really got back like an hour ago uh and you can see it
[03:13:38.320 --> 03:13:42.880]  where they are holding her not not just touching her on the arm but holding her up under the elbow
[03:13:42.880 --> 03:13:48.400]  she sees it so they start closing the gate uh to basically cover up what's going on you know
[03:13:48.400 --> 03:13:52.720]  when a lot of times when guys are being gentlemanly and they want to help a woman like just to be
[03:13:52.720 --> 03:13:57.600]  caught you don't grab them by the arm unless you're Joe Biden and like gently and then oh here let
[03:13:57.600 --> 03:14:01.920]  me help you you don't like here a little late unless you're Joe Biden grab a little girl yank
[03:14:01.920 --> 03:14:08.640]  you up by your arm you know she needed help obviously getting out yeah we found the video so
[03:14:08.640 --> 03:14:14.560]  i retweeted to my timeline so as you can see they're escorting her to the back of the van
[03:14:14.560 --> 03:14:20.400]  because they don't want to see anybody have her lift her up so it's amazing that we're going to
[03:14:20.400 --> 03:14:24.640]  show that when we come back from break oh here here's the footage Hillary's still traveling on
[03:14:24.640 --> 03:14:28.640]  what appears to be a modified van i mean look at her hobbling out she's got a boot on that's what

[03:20:34.240 --> 03:20:38.080]  there's more footage coming up this hour more footage on the war room with oh it's royer
[03:20:38.080 --> 03:20:42.080]  and roger stone and mike cernovich is one of the contributors as well mike cernovich is hosting
[03:20:42.080 --> 03:20:45.360]  this hour i'm getting out of this segment even though i'm invited because i gotta go look at all
[03:20:45.360 --> 03:20:51.600]  the rest of this footage and i'm gonna be listening to mike but if you missed it here's the footage
[03:20:51.600 --> 03:20:56.320]  you tie this in with all of her other collapsing that she still has the ambulance uh that she's
[03:20:56.320 --> 03:21:01.680]  hobbling around with a boot on i mean she looks like she is basically living in a nursing home
[03:21:01.680 --> 03:21:06.240]  and look look she's an evil woman they tried to cover up her illnesses we're slowing this footage
[03:21:06.240 --> 03:21:11.600]  down there was one car millie was saying behind the motorcade that got in late so they were able
[03:21:11.600 --> 03:21:16.720]  to close the gates to cover up what was happening let's back that up again and millie and her cameraman
[03:21:16.720 --> 03:21:22.000]  gabin wentz caught it on tape that she's being lifted out of the black ambulance which is a
[03:21:22.000 --> 03:21:28.000]  mobile ambulance but black so you don't know it's a black ambulance this is simply incredible millie
[03:21:28.000 --> 03:21:34.080]  tell us about this video narrate this for radio listeners and what else you saw well you could
[03:21:34.080 --> 03:21:39.200]  tell that by the way they were having her come into the back end of the bookstore they were trying
[03:21:39.200 --> 03:21:43.360]  to have it very discreet and private they even had gates that they could shut so that you wouldn't
[03:21:43.360 --> 03:21:47.840]  see it but like you were saying there was a tail end of the motorcade that came in late had some
[03:21:47.840 --> 03:21:52.720]  problems trying to weaseling through shimming through the gate and that's what allowed us to
[03:21:52.720 --> 03:21:57.520]  capture this footage but she could have clearly been dropped off at the very front entrance
[03:21:57.520 --> 03:22:03.200]  of the bookstore and she could have waved to her fans who were sitting out there sitting on the
[03:22:03.200 --> 03:22:08.000]  floor probably waiting for hours to come see her but that's not what happened she had Claire's
[03:22:08.000 --> 03:22:12.160]  day being lifted out of a vehicle that's right which was what the secret service told us she's
[03:22:12.160 --> 03:22:16.560]  got to be lifted out of vehicles put back in that was over a year ago that she fell down a month
[03:22:16.560 --> 03:22:22.000]  after we were told and you've been on her tail you and gabin that's right and her staff was so
[03:22:22.000 --> 03:22:26.000]  cult-like i mean look at them all standing around i mean obviously you have people there but but
[03:22:26.000 --> 03:22:29.760]  this guy here he was one of the ones that followed me around the the guy with the beard
[03:22:29.760 --> 03:22:34.880]  followed me around the entire time where i was with along with that other security guy in the green
[03:22:34.880 --> 03:22:39.280]  and they were the ones harassing following me pushing their body up against me and what did
[03:22:39.280 --> 03:22:43.360]  the awesome police say to them the Austin police told them to stop they said you you know you need
[03:22:43.360 --> 03:22:49.440]  to keep a distance from her and i was very grateful for the awesome police and even Hillary Clinton's
[03:22:49.440 --> 03:22:54.080]  crazed female staff members that came and told me i had to leave right now because i was harassing
[03:22:54.080 --> 03:22:59.840]  and hurting people's feelings and offending people um they didn't seem to care that these guys were
[03:22:59.840 --> 03:23:04.560]  kind of manhandling me in a way and that they threatened we're going to call the police they
[03:23:04.560 --> 03:23:09.120]  said please do call the police because you know i'm allowed to be here this is the public well
[03:23:09.120 --> 03:23:13.600]  this is Hillary again like the secret service told us over a year ago having to be lifted out of
[03:23:13.600 --> 03:23:19.520]  vehicles Mike Sernovich the dawn of brazil all of it coming out the establishment turning against
[03:23:19.520 --> 03:23:26.080]  the clinton's what does this signify to you well i would like to know if the the media the new york
[03:23:26.080 --> 03:23:32.080]  times is going to report that a female journalist millie weaver was potentially assaulted in a major
[03:23:32.080 --> 03:23:37.120]  attack on the free press by hillary clinton's people um i think that's very interesting that
[03:23:37.760 --> 03:23:44.000]  it's okay for a conservative or independent journalist to be manhandled by hillary clinton's
[03:23:44.000 --> 03:23:49.440]  i know we know if i've gone after women before that have been abused by bill clinton and it's not
[03:23:49.440 --> 03:23:54.000]  the first time it's not the first time i've been to her other rallies during the campaign season
[03:23:54.000 --> 03:23:58.000]  and her staff was always really crazy and attacking me mike what does this signify to you
[03:23:58.000 --> 03:24:02.960]  though the whole establishment turning against the clinton's what does that signify well they're
[03:24:02.960 --> 03:24:09.440]  trying to regain the moral high ground which they lost by defending anthony weiner al franken
[03:24:10.080 --> 03:24:16.480]  frankenstein's monster kevin spacey winestein the whole thing and they know that they realized hey
[03:24:16.480 --> 03:24:24.080]  we can't falsely accuse the right wing people of stuff if the real accusation can accusations against
[03:24:24.080 --> 03:24:29.120]  our people aren't addressed either so now they're going well bill clinton he's old he's senile
[03:24:29.120 --> 03:24:34.080]  hillary clinton she has parkinsons who are you know or whatever donna brazil by the way
[03:24:34.640 --> 03:24:39.360]  confirmed again i've never gotten apology confirmed that doctors who liked hillary
[03:24:40.080 --> 03:24:46.080]  were actually emailing about her health but again the fake news media does are they fired one doctor
[03:24:46.080 --> 03:24:50.800]  that went public and said listen i'm not against her but you know this lady's got serious medical
[03:24:50.800 --> 03:24:58.000]  problems yeah dr drew lost his whole show remember that i mean the cover-up it really shows how high
[03:24:58.000 --> 03:25:04.160]  the cover-up goes as dr drew very popular he's a liberal by the way he's not one of us and
[03:25:04.160 --> 03:25:09.280]  he just said wow there's something wrong here boom show canceled the machine that's what they
[03:25:09.280 --> 03:25:13.520]  would do to protect but the clinton's aren't giving up and the and their minions aren't
[03:25:13.520 --> 03:25:17.760]  so when you've got an immovable object comes into the unstoppable force you get explosions
[03:25:17.760 --> 03:25:24.640]  exactly but now that the clinton's lack power they're saying well we'll just throw bill clinton
[03:25:24.640 --> 03:25:30.160]  away because he can't raise money for us even senator gilbrand she goes oh bill clinton should
[03:25:30.160 --> 03:25:35.120]  have been a removed from office after the monica lawinsky affair which by the way no he shouldn't
[03:25:35.120 --> 03:25:41.040]  have on me so she's now basically agreeing with the impeachment right even though she was with
[03:25:41.040 --> 03:25:48.480]  him all last year raising money well you know bill clinton was actually impeached for lying
[03:25:49.200 --> 03:25:53.520]  he was impeached for lying it wasn't the act actually of yeah no it was consensual with her
[03:25:53.520 --> 03:25:57.040]  i don't think it was that was an issue it should be an issue with christian voters or whatever
[03:25:57.040 --> 03:26:02.560]  it they cover up consensual sex like it's the raping or pedophilia no it's not but then they
[03:26:02.560 --> 03:26:09.120]  don't want to talk about the actual cases like you know uh cathleen willie and exactly so let me
[03:26:09.120 --> 03:26:16.320]  ask you this question in my sternum is why are they trying to mix normal sexual relationships
[03:26:16.320 --> 03:26:22.240]  in with like pedophilia and rape it's it's not going to work it seems like an attack on heterosexual
[03:26:22.240 --> 03:26:26.080]  relationships in general attack on the family now what do you think mike i think that's what it is
[03:26:27.120 --> 03:26:31.680]  yeah well i've said this before too and i know that it resounded because the southern poverty
[03:26:31.680 --> 03:26:37.120]  law center was really upset as i said the reason that they're attacking us is because they want
[03:26:37.120 --> 03:26:42.640]  to attack the nuclear family and that is why they were trying to destroy us whenever they can
[03:26:42.640 --> 03:26:47.840]  they want the degeneracy and also what they're what they're trying to do is they want it and the
[03:26:47.840 --> 03:26:55.120]  washington post did this let's let's re-examine the roymor story if wapo had only run one story
[03:26:55.120 --> 03:27:00.320]  where a 14 year old girl accused roymor of what he did i think i would have believed it actually
[03:27:00.320 --> 03:27:04.320]  but it was all package targeted ready and a bunch of it's been proven to be fake
[03:27:04.320 --> 03:27:10.000]  yeah and then they then then they go oh and there was an 18 year old and then the media lumped them
[03:27:10.000 --> 03:27:16.000]  all in as accusers right so watch the trick the media did the media goes four women have accused
[03:27:16.000 --> 03:27:20.960]  roymor well no they didn't and if it if you go on a date with an eight if an 18 year old girl says
[03:27:20.960 --> 03:27:25.600]  i went on a date with the guy and we had a nice cream cone and he never did anything that's not
[03:27:25.600 --> 03:27:30.400]  an accusation there's nothing wrong with that right so but then they go oh but i mean the real
[03:27:30.400 --> 03:27:35.200]  deal is i think it's a little a little creepy but it's not illegal the guy is a the guy's a stud
[03:27:35.840 --> 03:27:40.000]  okay the point is his problem is he wasn't raping him he wasn't a pedophile then he'd be in the club
[03:27:40.960 --> 03:27:46.000]  yeah so i wasn't you know i wasn't defending him being 32 years old walking around in a suit
[03:27:46.000 --> 03:27:50.960]  in a shopping mall yeah i mean i think it's creepy it's it's it's it's like a creepy studly guy but
[03:27:50.960 --> 03:27:54.640]  you know and there could be something real the point is if something real comes out we're gonna
[03:27:54.640 --> 03:27:58.640]  throw him overboard the democrats are still defending you know msnbc and they're defending
[03:27:58.640 --> 03:28:03.520]  al franken but in some of these states it wasn't illegal to go on a date with someone in that age
[03:28:03.520 --> 03:28:09.040]  exactly for me it's creepy but it is it harvey weinstein no what do you think mike well yeah
[03:28:09.040 --> 03:28:14.640]  and did you notice that gloria all read when she went on the news she said she wouldn't admit
[03:28:14.640 --> 03:28:18.880]  that the signature was authentic have you guys played that i saw that i had that in the clip
[03:28:18.880 --> 03:28:24.160]  i never got to it in fact well you know we've got that when we come back um grills all read over
[03:28:24.160 --> 03:28:31.520]  more accusers and uh she went on to say she wouldn't say it was real yeah you're on video
[03:28:31.520 --> 03:28:36.640]  it's amazing i can neither confirm nor deny you know lawyer speak well mike we're gonna be watching
[03:28:36.640 --> 03:28:40.320]  and gearing up the next show and oh you're gonna be tweeting out a lot of stuff big breaking news
[03:28:40.320 --> 03:28:44.400]  you're a great team effort everybody getting this out you're taking over if you want that clip
[03:28:44.400 --> 03:28:50.800]  and we have katie turr grills gloria all read over it and a lot more straight ahead on the other

[03:32:25.920 --> 03:32:34.640]  just pure power cult will to dominate and control society and that we have come so far with god's

[03:34:00.160 --> 03:34:06.720]  not be with today because i'm not always able to talk with you on fridays because i just wrapped
[03:34:06.720 --> 03:34:13.520]  up production on a big film everybody's so busy that's the thing is we do live in a golden era
[03:34:14.320 --> 03:34:20.560]  of media and journalism i right now am sitting on a bombshell story that will rock the halls of
[03:34:20.560 --> 03:34:27.360]  congress that i'm working on i'm here talking with all of you we're building a big film that i was
[03:34:27.360 --> 03:34:34.160]  doing that's in post production alex is building the studios out and this is why the support
[03:34:34.160 --> 03:34:40.160]  from all of you is so important and why the product specials matter so much because there are no
[03:34:40.160 --> 03:34:47.360]  outside advertisers for alex there's no outside advertisers for me this is all a hundred percent
[03:34:47.360 --> 03:34:51.200]  listener funded and a lot of people don't get it i hear from people in right wing media all the time
[03:34:51.920 --> 03:34:57.840]  you know mike i can't make any money doing this mike you know this mike that because toyota corolla
[03:34:57.840 --> 03:35:03.840]  corolla isn't going to advertise with right wing media with the media that tells the truth you're
[03:35:03.840 --> 03:35:10.240]  not going to get mercedes-benz you're not going to get bmw currig the coffee maker they even
[03:35:10.240 --> 03:35:17.040]  pulled out some hanity right hot dog companies pulled their ass from hanity you name it it's so
[03:35:17.040 --> 03:35:22.080]  that's why the support of the listeners are important but it's a two-way commitment right
[03:35:22.080 --> 03:35:28.640]  that's why i'm here on a friday on my birthday with you because your support matters and i thank
[03:35:28.640 --> 03:35:32.880]  you for the support that you've given me the support that you've given the whole info wars
[03:35:32.880 --> 03:35:38.480]  crew because there are a lot of people who are very grateful for all the support you are giving
[03:35:38.480 --> 03:35:43.040]  and you give that every time you order and you get stuff on autoship and you buy the products
[03:35:43.040 --> 03:35:48.960]  while they're on special subscribe and save caveman trupalia formula that's the product that i was
[03:35:48.960 --> 03:35:54.400]  plugged because that's the one i personally use with me i just don't plug anything right i just
[03:35:54.400 --> 03:35:59.440]  don't because i don't plug anything that i don't take but i know the caveman stuff is amazing
[03:35:59.440 --> 03:36:05.920]  it's collagen i've done smoothie recipes before with frozen berries smooth and smoothy recipes
[03:36:05.920 --> 03:36:12.160]  with a banana almond milk you throw in some caveman trupalia strawberry formula with some frozen
[03:36:12.160 --> 03:36:17.280]  blueberries and a banana and you have all the nutrition you need for your joints and other
[03:36:17.280 --> 03:36:23.360]  parts of your body and that's the one that i i think is the best and so thank you again for
[03:36:23.360 --> 03:36:28.960]  your support and let's get back to well that is fun by the way you know i'm actually publishing
[03:36:28.960 --> 03:36:35.200]  an article today 40 life lessons when i turn 40 which is kind of like cliche but it's kind of cool
[03:36:35.200 --> 03:36:41.760]  those things tend to go viral and we do want our message of positivity to go viral i really don't
[03:36:41.760 --> 03:36:47.360]  like that people don't realize how positive and upbeat and fun alex says you see a side of that
[03:36:47.360 --> 03:36:52.640]  on the show but you know what we're doing is warfare every day warfare against the globalist
[03:36:52.640 --> 03:36:58.000]  warfare against the pedophile hollywood establishment very important to remember though
[03:36:58.000 --> 03:37:04.640]  to spend time with your family to reflect to be good to one another that's ultimately the message
[03:37:04.640 --> 03:37:10.240]  from me the message from the whole info wars team is we want to make the world better the fake news
[03:37:10.240 --> 03:37:15.120]  media they have to lie about us actually to make us look bad because all we want to do is make the
[03:37:15.120 --> 03:37:20.240]  world a better place we want you to be healthier wealthier wiser and every day and that's why we
[03:37:20.240 --> 03:37:28.480]  share real news where i gotta give credit to NBC i never thought i would say this but NBC did some
[03:37:28.480 --> 03:37:35.760]  real journalism in this video you're about to watch i couldn't believe i watched this on NBC
[03:37:35.760 --> 03:37:40.640]  i'll be completely honest with you this video you're about to watch a journalist named katie tour
[03:37:41.440 --> 03:37:47.680]  actually does real journalism and confronts gloria all read about potential forge reactions
[03:37:48.480 --> 03:37:53.600]  so i want you if you're at home listening very very attentively and if you're watching to watch
[03:37:53.600 --> 03:37:59.600]  attentively let's play that clip and then let's analyze it once it's over at this point i have
[03:37:59.600 --> 03:38:07.520]  no reason to believe that that uh that what he wrote in the yearbook is anything but his signature
[03:38:07.520 --> 03:38:10.400]  does your client favorly young nelson remember him signing it
[03:38:14.240 --> 03:38:22.480]  she remembers his well she remembers being with him it was on the counter uh she alleges that he
[03:38:22.480 --> 03:38:30.320]  took it that he signed it and she was thrilled that he had signed it because as far as she knew
[03:38:30.320 --> 03:38:36.400]  he was a d.a. and that was an important position so she thought at the time she had a clue whether
[03:38:36.400 --> 03:38:45.360]  he was an assistant d.a. or a d.a. but he signed it she took it uh as far as she knows um i mean
[03:38:45.360 --> 03:38:49.200]  there's no reason for her to think it's anybody anything but his signature did she see him sign it
[03:38:49.200 --> 03:38:58.800]  uh you know i don't i i haven't asked her if she saw him but we did describe what happened that
[03:38:59.440 --> 03:39:05.840]  evening in question uh that what she alleges was that she put it on the counter uh that i think
[03:39:05.840 --> 03:39:11.280]  that he asked to sign or that he did sign it that's all um i asked this because it seems like
[03:39:11.280 --> 03:39:19.120]  you're not 100 sure that it is his signature and if you're not 100 sure that it is his signature
[03:39:19.120 --> 03:39:25.360]  why would you show it at a press conference well why would you know why does anybody doubt
[03:39:25.360 --> 03:39:29.760]  that it is his signature well Roy Moore's campaign is saying and Roy Moore himself is saying it's
[03:39:29.760 --> 03:39:39.360]  not his signature well he has a motive to say that uh and uh and and let him prove that it's not we
[03:39:39.360 --> 03:39:46.480]  have offered to provide it to an independent expert uh at the hearing which would be held in
[03:39:46.480 --> 03:39:53.440]  in Washington and uh and they we have allowed it to be examined so have you gotten any response
[03:39:53.440 --> 03:40:01.120]  from anybody i have no reason i have they have not provided me any evidence to suggest that it is
[03:40:01.120 --> 03:40:08.720]  not his signature all i've they've done is make this bold assertion that it's not but they have
[03:40:08.720 --> 03:40:16.080]  not provided any evidence whatsoever to us to uh support their assertion of course they have a
[03:40:16.080 --> 03:40:23.600]  motive to make that assertion because he is denying first he denied even knowing her then he uh he
[03:40:23.600 --> 03:40:30.960]  compounded that uh or confused that whole issue by saying something to the effect that oh well she
[03:40:30.960 --> 03:40:38.880]  appeared before him in a divorce case and uh apparently that does not appear to be accurate
[03:40:38.880 --> 03:40:48.000]  either when you wow i would i i've telling people if you want to witness a master class
[03:40:48.000 --> 03:40:56.000]  in deception how to spot a liar just watch that video with the sound on and then the sound off
[03:40:56.560 --> 03:41:03.040]  can you say kd tour by the way all clear to kd tour i don't do this very often but i want to i
[03:41:03.040 --> 03:41:08.320]  always believe that we should give because that's integrity i always believe that as hard as i am on
[03:41:08.320 --> 03:41:13.040]  the fake news i don't have a problem with real journalism i have a problem with fake news and
[03:41:13.600 --> 03:41:20.640]  i tip my hat to kd tour there that was a master class and exposing a liar gloria all read would
[03:41:20.640 --> 03:41:26.960]  not defend her client so i don't know what to say i'll tell you this 100 confession my confession
[03:41:26.960 --> 03:41:34.640]  time the story i got wrong when people told me that that yearbook signature was fake i'm going to
[03:41:34.640 --> 03:41:40.640]  tell you right away that i told people guys that sounds like a conspiracy theory i don't believe it
[03:41:40.640 --> 03:41:47.600]  leave me alone the idea maybe i'm just naive the idea that they would go to that length to forge a
[03:41:47.600 --> 03:41:52.480]  signature like this right so you can read my tweets where i told people that i believe the
[03:41:52.480 --> 03:41:58.960]  yearbook was authentic i told people that i thought it was a conspiracy theory to doubt it and now i'm
[03:41:58.960 --> 03:42:04.320]  the one who looks like the fool but you got to own your mistakes in life and i own that mistake i
[03:42:04.320 --> 03:42:10.000]  accused a lot of people of spreading conspiracy theory about a forged signature but gloria all
[03:42:10.000 --> 03:42:15.120]  read right there confirmed the conspiracy theory she's the one who won't stand by her client this
[03:42:15.120 --> 03:42:22.800]  is her client she doesn't trust her own client she doesn't believe it's true she's hedging her bet
[03:42:22.800 --> 03:42:28.160]  so gloria all read is now the person who has cast that entire signature into doubt and that really
[03:42:28.160 --> 03:42:34.640]  goes to show the real problem of fake news they had me conned and i and i spot fake news for a
[03:42:34.640 --> 03:42:41.040]  living i'm doing a documentary on fake news called hoax even with my great ability to spot media hoaxes
[03:42:41.760 --> 03:42:48.080]  even i mike cernovich fell victim to the con of the fake news media and that forgery so that goes
[03:42:48.080 --> 03:42:52.720]  to show i don't know how much can you trust on the news probably none of it but you can trust
[03:42:52.720 --> 03:42:58.160]  info war is probably not a lot to our listeners and viewers that without you funding our operation

[03:47:29.360 --> 03:47:37.040]  and we'll call this segment how congress covers up sexual misconduct sexual harassment and sexual
[03:47:37.040 --> 03:47:43.120]  assault by its members this is very very disturbing stuff that i'm about to break a bigger story on
[03:47:43.120 --> 03:47:49.520]  probably monday we'll see it's a very big story everybody in congress is going to feel it it'll
[03:47:49.520 --> 03:47:54.800]  be on the level of the susan rye story so stay tuned for that but what i've been learning is that
[03:47:54.800 --> 03:48:00.640]  if we click onto um uh read wilson had a tweet where the congressional office of compliance
[03:48:00.640 --> 03:48:05.920]  releases a year by year breakdown of harassment claims and settlements so we're going to take
[03:48:05.920 --> 03:48:10.960]  a look at this chart and for those of you just listening in excuse me for those of you listening
[03:48:10.960 --> 03:48:18.800]  in we'll just read it to you and those of you home can watch there is a star chamber designed to
[03:48:19.760 --> 03:48:25.920]  completely silence victims of sexual misconduct by congressmen so it's called the congressional
[03:48:25.920 --> 03:48:32.880]  office of compliance now under federal law under federal law any complaint a staffer makes against
[03:48:32.880 --> 03:48:39.520]  a congressman or congresswoman it has to be kept confidential it goes to this very quiet little
[03:48:39.520 --> 03:48:45.680]  star chamber where you don't have any due process of law government attorneys bully you berate you
[03:48:45.680 --> 03:48:52.720]  they do anything they can to keep quiet and then if they settle the lawsuit with you under law
[03:48:52.720 --> 03:48:58.160]  under federal law it would be a violation of federal law for you to go public with this
[03:48:59.280 --> 03:49:05.440]  so what are they hiding well we're about to reveal a lot of this because when i found this
[03:49:05.440 --> 03:49:10.240]  chart where they talked about the number of settlements every year there was one year i
[03:49:10.240 --> 03:49:14.480]  believe there was something like four million dollars in settlements i can see if i can pull
[03:49:14.480 --> 03:49:22.000]  the chart up real quick because the numbers are startling in 2007 25 sexual misconduct cases were
[03:49:22.000 --> 03:49:30.400]  settled four million dollars in 2002 10 were settled for 3.9 million dollars and then in other
[03:49:30.400 --> 03:49:37.280]  years you have four hundred thousand eight hundred thousand eight hundred six thousand dollars big
[03:49:37.280 --> 03:49:45.040]  numbers now we the taxpayers are paying this this should be a way bigger story as bad as al
[03:49:45.040 --> 03:49:50.560]  franken's video was maybe some people could say well it was a joke do i agree with that look you
[03:49:50.560 --> 03:49:56.160]  know i've said a few things trolling that i shouldn't have said let he you know i'm not going to cast
[03:49:56.160 --> 03:50:04.640]  a lot of stones but this is not a joke this is taxpayer money being paid out for the misconduct
[03:50:04.640 --> 03:50:10.960]  of members of congress many of whom are multi-millionaires they're using taxpayer money
[03:50:11.760 --> 03:50:17.360]  to seduce women and then when the women complain or when they're not being seduced when they're
[03:50:17.360 --> 03:50:25.280]  actually being harassed our money is paying them to go away and it's all silent so we have to get
[03:50:25.280 --> 03:50:34.240]  this out there so what i've done is and it's my pen tweet right now i'm offering a cash reward for a
[03:50:34.240 --> 03:50:39.760]  list of these settlements so i have said that i will give ten thousand dollars i would give ten
[03:50:39.760 --> 03:50:48.400]  thousand dollars cash bitcoin check whatever people want to do i want to know about these
[03:50:48.400 --> 03:50:53.840]  settlements the fake news media by the way has always known about this office of compliance
[03:50:53.840 --> 03:50:59.840]  in these secret star chambers but most of these people who are engaging misconduct as we now
[03:50:59.840 --> 03:51:06.960]  learning are democrats so the media rather than doing their job and finding out who is doing this
[03:51:07.920 --> 03:51:14.560]  and they're covering up for democrats yet again but they can't cover up for democrats anymore
[03:51:14.560 --> 03:51:20.800]  because now they want to come after roi more now suddenly they care oh roi more they got to go after
[03:51:20.800 --> 03:51:26.400]  roi more well where were they when anthony weiner was sexting underage girls which by the way was
[03:51:26.400 --> 03:51:33.440]  caught on camera anthony weiner is going to prison because he was caught on camera seducing a 15 year
[03:51:33.440 --> 03:51:40.560]  old the the media reported that he was you know in a lot of trouble but they didn't report that he
[03:51:40.560 --> 03:51:49.680]  was married to umma he had access to classified emails classified information this man the sexual
[03:51:49.680 --> 03:51:56.320]  predator was almost in the white house he was a great friend of chuck schumer you notice that the
[03:51:56.320 --> 03:52:02.320]  media never called democrats and said hey chuck schumer do you disavow anthony weiner they said
[03:52:02.320 --> 03:52:06.080]  oh well we'll report on the charges against them but we're not going to hold democrats
[03:52:06.080 --> 03:52:13.440]  accountable you can't hold here's how the media plays it mike you can't expect us to blame every
[03:52:13.440 --> 03:52:20.320]  democrat for something another democrat does even when he was part of the clinton's inner circle
[03:52:20.320 --> 03:52:25.600]  even when bill clinton officiated weiner's and umma's wedding mike you can't do that that's an
[03:52:25.600 --> 03:52:33.440]  unfair standard to do so we're not going to do it but then suddenly when roi more is accused
[03:52:34.400 --> 03:52:39.760]  in some cases of merely going on a date for ice cream with an 18 year old that's an accusation
[03:52:39.760 --> 03:52:45.440]  if you're a republican going on a date and eating an ice cream cone with an 18 year old
[03:52:45.440 --> 03:52:50.640]  that constitutes an accusation right but if you're 15 years old and you're you know sexually
[03:52:50.640 --> 03:52:55.920]  assaulting young girls 15 year olds and it's on camera well you know that isn't the fault of democrats
[03:52:56.960 --> 03:53:04.560]  well with roi more within 44 minutes our media had called every republican in the senate
[03:53:04.560 --> 03:53:10.640]  and demanded a statement and asked them to disavow roi more who by the way is not in the senate
[03:53:10.640 --> 03:53:17.840]  let's be quite clear about this roi more is not in the senate so isn't it interesting how
[03:53:17.840 --> 03:53:23.280]  when it's a republican accused of something even if it's just merely going and having an ice cream
[03:53:23.280 --> 03:53:29.440]  cone with an 18 year old the media is all over it they're calling every republican you better do
[03:53:29.440 --> 03:53:34.640]  you better do something about it you better say something about it but when it's a democrat caught
[03:53:34.640 --> 03:53:40.720]  on camera doing something bad the media goes oh come on guys you're being unreasonable you can't
[03:53:40.720 --> 03:53:47.840]  expect every democrat to take person responsibility for what one bad apple did right it's always a
[03:53:47.840 --> 03:53:53.120]  bad apple oh it's just a bad apple even though over and over it's been shown that democrats are
[03:53:53.120 --> 03:54:01.600]  actually the real rapists democrats are the real rapists so yeah 25 senators disavowed roi more
[03:54:01.600 --> 03:54:08.000]  within like a matter of minutes because every reporter was on the phone calling them well
[03:54:08.000 --> 03:54:16.000]  how many report how many senators have disavowed al franken where's that story right that that's
[03:54:16.000 --> 03:54:19.600]  what the media and that's why they hate us and they want to get us all banned and everything
[03:54:19.600 --> 03:54:24.080]  because if it weren't for us they wouldn't have even reported on al franken i called the media
[03:54:24.080 --> 03:54:33.360]  people out it was noon eastern standard time before chris l hayes dav weigel of the washington
[03:54:33.360 --> 03:54:41.200]  post matthew glacial vox you name a high level democrat they waited hours and i call them a
[03:54:41.200 --> 03:54:46.160]  high level democrats because if you do work in the mainstream media for the washington posts or
[03:54:46.160 --> 03:54:50.640]  cnn that's what you are you're a high level democrat it took them hours and then i'm on social
[03:54:50.640 --> 03:54:55.840]  media going through their timelines screencapping is saying look we haven't heard anything from these
[03:54:55.840 --> 03:55:01.360]  high level democrat operatives in the media and then suddenly they realized oh we're gonna we're
[03:55:01.360 --> 03:55:07.200]  getting caught well we got a band cernovich one of these days but until we have him banned
[03:55:07.200 --> 03:55:12.720]  because i'm like the socrates of twitter right i'm the gadfly i'm the guy saying well wait a
[03:55:12.720 --> 03:55:17.920]  minute chris l hayes you were just saying that every republican has to disavow roi more
[03:55:19.200 --> 03:55:24.720]  but now you're not even talking about al franken who is caught on camera what about that so using
[03:55:24.720 --> 03:55:30.800]  the socratic method because i'm the socrates of twitter they hate me and they do want to give me
[03:55:30.800 --> 03:55:36.880]  the hemlock and virtual hemlock they want me removed from the internet virtually and i do
[03:55:36.880 --> 03:55:43.280]  sincerely believe based on reasonable information that they do want me killed with literal hemlock
[03:55:43.280 --> 03:55:47.600]  if they had the power and could get away with it but luckily there are people watching out for us
[03:55:48.480 --> 03:55:56.160]  and indeed wapo even ran a column by kate harding who says i'm a feminist but we should keep out
[03:55:56.160 --> 03:56:02.960]  franken in office so this is an amazing column i encourage everybody to read it where she goes
[03:56:02.960 --> 03:56:10.400]  i'm a feminist i study rape culture and i don't want al franken to resign the mask has slipped off
[03:56:11.440 --> 03:56:19.120]  she admits it doesn't matter what you do you can be a rapist if you're a democrat if you're a democrat
[03:56:19.120 --> 03:56:25.520]  and you're caught on camera molesting a woman they'll even call it a virtual grope this was a
[03:56:25.520 --> 03:56:32.880]  great line from you know nbc because we we praised katie tour on nbc for actually asking gloria all
[03:56:32.880 --> 03:56:43.120]  read real questions another commentator on nbc had said well al franken didn't grope her it was a mock
[03:56:43.120 --> 03:56:48.080]  groping boy they really want to look at camera angles when it's a democrat right so even when you
[03:56:48.080 --> 03:56:55.360]  give them even when you give them a picture they're like well you know where his fingers technically
[03:56:55.360 --> 03:57:01.840]  touching her was it merely hovering at what yeah nbc punnett said not actually groping is mock
[03:57:02.560 --> 03:57:09.920]  groping right amazing the the level of mental gymnastics will go through to protect their own
[03:57:09.920 --> 03:57:14.000]  so that's why i'm grateful that kate harding in the washington post said oh we know he groped her
[03:57:14.800 --> 03:57:21.440]  but who cares he's one of us and we will protect our own so keep that in mind when they call you
[03:57:21.440 --> 03:57:27.760]  the great listeners they call you a conspiracy theorist the conspiracy is now out in the open
[03:57:27.760 --> 03:57:34.400]  where they admit that they conspire to cover up for their own side great hour thanks everybody
[03:57:34.400 --> 03:57:42.400]  you can again find me facebook.com forward slash mike cernovich or twitter.com forward slash c-e-r-n-o
