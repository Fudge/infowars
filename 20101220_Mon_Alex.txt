[00:00.000 --> 00:12.040]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.040 --> 00:20.800]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:20.800 --> 00:31.300]  December 20th 2010 hello and welcome to the Alex Jones show Alex is taking a
[00:31.300 --> 00:35.140]  well-deserved break so I'll be your fill-in host for today Paul Joseph
[00:35.140 --> 00:41.200]  Watson editor and writer for prisonplanet.com and of course as
[00:41.200 --> 00:45.960]  ever we've got a gargantuan amount of news to cover we're gonna be going to
[00:45.960 --> 00:51.200]  some of your calls during the course of the broadcast and in the second hour we
[00:51.200 --> 00:56.640]  welcome political scientist former fighter pilot and of course editor of the
[00:56.640 --> 01:03.040]  world affairs brief Joel Scousen to discuss the so-called tax cut
[01:03.040 --> 01:09.200]  legislation the WikiLeaks situation the latest developments on that the economy
[01:09.200 --> 01:17.080]  and much much more but first some of our top stories today and at the moment
[01:17.080 --> 01:22.240]  there's no story bigger of course than the Washington Post gleefully it seems
[01:22.240 --> 01:28.120]  reporting that the American people are now all basically al-Qaeda until proven
[01:28.120 --> 01:33.920]  innocent that's right the federal state and local governments are using methods
[01:33.920 --> 01:40.520]  first inflicted on the populations of Iraq and Afghanistan to quote collect
[01:40.520 --> 01:45.920]  information about Americans using the FBI local police and state homeland
[01:45.920 --> 01:52.160]  security and this is an eight-page article in the Washington Post today
[01:52.160 --> 01:57.960]  which reveals how you know to fight the terrorists of course the terrorists who
[01:57.960 --> 02:02.080]  supposedly attacked us because they hate our freedom the federal government is
[02:02.080 --> 02:06.720]  now busy using every trick in the book to strip Americans of their
[02:06.720 --> 02:13.640]  constitutional rights and treat them as terrorists now the headline is monitoring
[02:13.640 --> 02:20.320]  America by Dana Priest and William M. Arkin this is the Washington Post from
[02:20.320 --> 02:26.560]  Afghanistan to Tennessee on a recent night in Memphis a patrol car rolled
[02:26.560 --> 02:31.520]  slowly through a parking lot in a rundown section of town the military
[02:31.520 --> 02:38.000]  grade infrared camera on its hood moved robotically from left to right snapping
[02:38.000 --> 02:43.320]  digital images of one license plate after another and analyzing each almost
[02:43.320 --> 02:48.640]  instantly suddenly a red light flashed on the car screen along with the word
[02:48.640 --> 02:55.840]  warrant got a live one let's do it an officer called out and it goes on in
[02:55.840 --> 03:01.280]  this Washington Post article to list all these different technologies mobile
[03:01.280 --> 03:08.560]  biometric fingerprint readers biometric face scanning cameras and of course we
[03:08.560 --> 03:13.640]  know about the mobile radiation scanner trucks all of which we used against
[03:13.640 --> 03:17.880]  suspected terrorists in Iraq and Afghanistan which are now being used
[03:17.880 --> 03:22.760]  against innocent Americans and the question to come out of all this because
[03:22.760 --> 03:26.720]  of course listeners to this show will largely know all this information to
[03:26.720 --> 03:31.820]  begin with but why are they throwing it in our faces and why is the Washington
[03:31.820 --> 03:35.960]  Post the you know the biggest establishment mouthpiece in America
[03:35.960 --> 03:43.680]  supposedly lifting the lid to reveal this surveillance panopticon well a it is
[03:43.680 --> 03:50.120]  to throw it in your face but moreover it's the process of learned helplessness
[03:50.120 --> 03:56.120]  and this is indoctrinating Americans to accept that the government's reading
[03:56.120 --> 03:59.800]  your emails that they're reading your instant messages listening to your phone
[03:59.800 --> 04:04.000]  conversations they know what websites you're visiting and that there's
[04:04.000 --> 04:09.360]  nothing you can do about it it's learned helplessness training people how to be
[04:09.360 --> 04:15.560]  good slaves and of course it's all in the name of stopping the terrorists the
[04:15.560 --> 04:22.200]  same terrorists who in every single case we documented since 9 11 are always
[04:22.200 --> 04:27.360]  entrapped by FBI informants and literally handed the bombs handed the
[04:27.360 --> 04:33.640]  explosives to carry out their deeds so as long as you know your conversations
[04:33.640 --> 04:38.120]  your emails and the websites you visit don't betray any signs of terrorism then
[04:38.120 --> 04:42.200]  you have nothing to worry about you can go back to sleep but of course there's a
[04:42.200 --> 04:46.640]  problem because what you consider to be terrorism isn't necessarily the same
[04:46.640 --> 04:50.920]  definition of what the federal government considers to be terrorist and I
[04:50.920 --> 04:54.760]  want to explore this further after the break on the Alex Jones show live

[08:04.880 --> 08:12.880]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[08:12.880 --> 08:23.880]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[08:23.880 --> 08:29.880]  it's the Alex Jones show live I'm your filling host Paul Joseph Watson now we were talking
[08:29.880 --> 08:34.880]  about before the break the fact that the Washington Post wants you to know that Big
[08:34.880 --> 08:42.880]  This is monitoring America for your safety and now part of their eyes and ears in monitoring
[08:42.880 --> 08:50.880]  America are trash collectors truck drivers Walmart shoppers and things like you know
[08:50.880 --> 08:55.880]  big sisters see something say something program they're the people who are now monitoring
[08:55.880 --> 09:02.880]  America for terrorists that the crack terrorist hunters and now the garbage collectors in
[09:02.880 --> 09:09.880]  the political community I bet that makes you feel very safe so we got big sis if you see
[09:09.880 --> 09:16.880]  something say something well I'll tell you what I see I see a decaying banana Republic
[09:16.880 --> 09:23.880]  which is following the path of every other dictatorship in history be it you know ruthless
[09:23.880 --> 09:29.880]  or blundering I see people being brainwashed every time they turn on the television and
[09:29.880 --> 09:37.880]  see si Miami you know every time you turn on the radio and there's an ad council commercial
[09:37.880 --> 09:43.880]  telling people to report suspicious activity and of course again it's all for our safety
[09:43.880 --> 09:48.880]  just like it was for the safety of those in the former East Germany to have their neighbors
[09:48.880 --> 09:56.880]  recruit to despise for the state to keep an eye on them I mean ask yourself the question
[09:56.880 --> 10:03.880]  why did the communist controlled government of East Germany recruit thousands of ordinary
[10:03.880 --> 10:12.880]  citizens as domestic informants because primarily they wanted to incarcerate political dissidents
[10:12.880 --> 10:20.880]  and prevent people from trying to escape beyond the Berlin wall this was a physical imprisonment
[10:20.880 --> 10:26.880]  political dissidents in East Germany were trying to escape from but in the 21st century
[10:26.880 --> 10:33.880]  it's all about preventing Americans from escaping from the psychological Berlin wall that is
[10:33.880 --> 10:40.880]  erected to prevent them from seeing the truth behind this you know concrete structure of
[10:40.880 --> 10:49.880]  lies and so long as this psychological Berlin wall is projected in the human consciousness
[10:49.880 --> 10:56.880]  these terror threats and the danger of your neighbor turning you in for you know flying
[10:56.880 --> 11:02.880]  an American flag handing out DVDs talking about the constitution talking about corruption
[11:02.880 --> 11:08.880]  in government all of which in the Mayak report and many others that we've covered here on
[11:08.880 --> 11:16.880]  the show and on the websites the law enforcement agencies and homeland security now define
[11:16.880 --> 11:24.880]  domestic extremism and terrorism this is about chilling free speech it's about making people
[11:24.880 --> 11:30.880]  afraid to talk about any of this in their emails phone conversations and through the information
[11:30.880 --> 11:40.880]  they get from visiting websites such as prisonplanet.com and info wars.com and this whole monitoring
[11:40.880 --> 11:47.880]  America apparatus has nothing to do with finding terrorists in every single case the terrorists
[11:47.880 --> 11:53.880]  are entrapped the terror plots are contrived if not outright staged we've documented
[11:53.880 --> 12:00.880]  that in triplicate on every occasion but it's got everything to do this monitoring America
[12:00.880 --> 12:07.880]  program within implanting this psychological Berlin wall in the minds of Americans and
[12:07.880 --> 12:14.880]  fear preventing them from ever attempting to escape from the prison planet and also helping
[12:14.880 --> 12:20.880]  others to do the same it's kind of like the cave allegory which we posted on the website
[12:20.880 --> 12:27.880]  on Sunday if you click on the featured stories archive then you'll be able to watch this
[12:27.880 --> 12:37.880]  video which is Plato's allegory of the cave and it's about four human being sat chained in a cave
[12:37.880 --> 12:42.880]  and they're watching a projection on the wall and on this projection the different shadows
[12:42.880 --> 12:49.880]  dance across it the other choosing of the masters that keep the people enslaved in this cave so
[12:49.880 --> 12:55.880]  while the people in the cave only ever see the shadows anyone who actually succeeds in
[12:55.880 --> 13:01.880]  escaping from that cave actually sees reality as it truly is but because those people so
[13:01.880 --> 13:07.880]  indoctrinated to only ever seeing the shadows and thinking that you know their lives would end
[13:07.880 --> 13:11.880]  if they ever saw beyond them then they in fact persecute the people who have become
[13:11.880 --> 13:17.880]  enlightened and who have escaped from their own enslavement and that plays into what we're
[13:17.880 --> 13:22.880]  seeing with this monitor America program because as in the former East Germany and
[13:22.880 --> 13:30.880]  indeed in Nazi Germany it was all about breeding distrust turning ordinary citizens against
[13:30.880 --> 13:38.880]  each other and as Robert Galately the Florida University professor found in his study of
[13:38.880 --> 13:46.880]  these informant snitch programs which are now coming to America during the 1930s and
[13:46.880 --> 13:55.880]  early 1940s in Nazi Germany the people who reported on their neighbors did so hardly
[13:55.880 --> 14:02.880]  ever out of genuine security concerns and indeed it never improved security one iota
[14:02.880 --> 14:07.880]  which demolishes that justification immediately what this Florida University
[14:07.880 --> 14:13.880]  professor found that was that people would report on their neighbors either for career
[14:13.880 --> 14:19.880]  goals so as to get them in legal trouble and jump over them on the career ladder for
[14:19.880 --> 14:26.880]  financial benefit to get rewards from becoming an informant and through this
[14:26.880 --> 14:34.880]  strange Pavlovian psychological need to receive approval and respect from an
[14:34.880 --> 14:41.880]  authority figure so in all three different cases of why people informed on their neighbors
[14:41.880 --> 14:49.880]  not one of those was because of genuine concerns about they might be a terrorist so in
[14:49.880 --> 14:55.880]  every historical case this has always turned out the same way and yet now with the
[14:55.880 --> 15:02.880]  big sis Walmart spying campaign the garbage collectors you know looking for crime looking
[15:02.880 --> 15:09.880]  for terrorists in Albany New York and many other areas of the country now over 10,000
[15:09.880 --> 15:15.880]  garbage collectors nationwide in America are performing the dual role of terrorist
[15:15.880 --> 15:21.880]  hunters and it's all heading in the same direction as we've seen in some of the darkest
[15:21.880 --> 15:27.880]  periods in human history that's why I say that is evidence that America is now a
[15:27.880 --> 15:35.880]  decaying banana republic and the only question surrounding where it's going in
[15:35.880 --> 15:42.880]  the next 5-10 years is whether it will be this bumbling authoritarian state or whether
[15:42.880 --> 15:48.880]  it will become absolutely ruthless as we saw in Nazi Germany that seems to be the
[15:48.880 --> 15:54.880]  only question left the fact that it's going towards this firmly authoritarian state
[15:54.880 --> 16:01.880]  is now beyond any doubt so that's monitoring America Washington Post
[16:01.880 --> 16:07.880]  article 8 pages throwing it in your face and it's linked up on prisonplanet.com in
[16:07.880 --> 16:12.880]  fact there's an AFP boil down of what's in it and that's what we've posted at
[16:12.880 --> 16:19.880]  prisonplanet.com because the actual story is 8 pages long so I encourage you to
[16:19.880 --> 16:26.880]  read it all shifting gears of course I'm broadcasting to you today from frozen
[16:26.880 --> 16:33.880]  Britain the country which just 10 years ago global warming alarmist said that
[16:33.880 --> 16:39.880]  children would never see the sight of snow again and we've got this quote which
[16:39.880 --> 16:47.880]  we posted on prisonplanet.com today in a flashback article this is from March 2000
[16:47.880 --> 16:54.880]  over 10 years ago Britain's winter ends tomorrow with further indications of a
[16:54.880 --> 17:00.880]  striking environmental change snow is starting to disappear from our lives
[17:00.880 --> 17:06.880]  that's what the global warming alarmist was saying 10 years ago and in this article
[17:06.880 --> 17:12.880]  he quotes the infamous CRU climate research center which was the epicenter
[17:12.880 --> 17:19.880]  of the climate gait scandal and one Mr David Weiner who stated quote children
[17:19.880 --> 17:25.880]  just aren't going to know what snow is well that's that's a little odd Mr Weiner
[17:25.880 --> 17:31.880]  because 10 years later I can look out my window and there's there's an awful lot
[17:31.880 --> 17:36.880]  the white stuff around today you know Heathrow Airport closed two days running
[17:36.880 --> 17:44.880]  Britain paralyzed deluged by snow coldest December in recorded history coldest
[17:44.880 --> 17:51.880]  temperature for decades measured at minus 26 degrees and yet the establishment
[17:51.880 --> 17:58.880]  media still gives discredited cranks like Mr Weiner who 10 years ago said that
[17:58.880 --> 18:05.880]  it would never snow again in Britain a platform to disseminate their vehemently
[18:05.880 --> 18:10.880]  debunked propaganda over and over again as we recently saw with the Cancun
[18:10.880 --> 18:16.880]  summit now in this article which was out the London independent written 10 years
[18:16.880 --> 18:22.880]  ago the alarmist say that global warming will cause milder winters in Britain
[18:22.880 --> 18:29.880]  remember that they said global warming would cause milder winters now of course
[18:29.880 --> 18:36.880]  10 years later they say that freezing is part of the warming even as Britain
[18:36.880 --> 18:43.880]  experiences its coldest winter on record coldest December on record the global
[18:43.880 --> 18:46.880]  warming hierarchy are just saying yeah that freezing is part of the global
[18:46.880 --> 18:51.880]  warming and if you repeat that ridiculous assertion enough times then the
[18:51.880 --> 18:56.880]  idiots might start to believe it but let's look at the actual facts behind
[18:56.880 --> 19:03.880]  this they say that Britain is being battered with this big chill the global
[19:03.880 --> 19:09.880]  warming alarmist do because you know the Gulf Stream is malfunctioning and again
[19:09.880 --> 19:14.880]  the Gulf Stream is malfunctioning and that's man's fault but there's a problem
[19:14.880 --> 19:19.880]  because that little scam doesn't work anymore for them both NASA and the Met
[19:19.880 --> 19:25.880]  Office which is basically the CRU discredited climate gate crooks in their
[19:25.880 --> 19:29.880]  own studies have now had to admit that their data on the Gulf Stream was
[19:29.880 --> 19:35.880]  completely inaccurate and that the Gulf Stream is unaffected but whether it's
[19:35.880 --> 19:40.880]  hotter or colder for them it doesn't matter it's all proof of man-made global
[19:40.880 --> 19:46.880]  warming freezing is now part of the warming any weather is man's fault and
[19:46.880 --> 19:52.880]  they will use it to ram through and exploit their agenda of complete
[19:52.880 --> 19:56.880]  regulation and control over the ultimate through carbon taxes and the genocidal

[24:24.880 --> 24:31.880]  there'll be a golden letter reaching down
[24:31.880 --> 24:37.880]  when the man comes around well the global warming alarmists have definitely
[24:37.880 --> 24:44.880]  decided who to blame for Britain's coldest December since records began and
[24:44.880 --> 24:51.880]  that's of course man-made climate change ten years ago they said that snow would
[24:51.880 --> 24:55.880]  disappear from our lives completely that children would grow up never seeing the
[24:55.880 --> 25:02.880]  site of snow and now he throw airport completely close flights cancelled
[25:02.880 --> 25:08.880]  whole country paralyzed from in places two feet of snow we had another two feet
[25:08.880 --> 25:13.880]  of snow a week ago you know for the past three winters we've been deluge with
[25:13.880 --> 25:20.880]  the stuff maximum record low temperatures recorded for decades minus twenty
[25:20.880 --> 25:28.880]  six degrees and of course that's all proof of global warming now notice that's
[25:28.880 --> 25:33.880]  what they're still claiming notice that whenever man-made global warming
[25:33.880 --> 25:39.880]  skeptics point to you know the coldest December in Britain since records began
[25:39.880 --> 25:48.880]  as evidence for global cooling the alarmists proudly proclaim oh but that's
[25:48.880 --> 25:52.880]  just the weather you know we're talking about climate models measured over a
[25:52.880 --> 25:57.880]  hundred years you know you can't quantify global warming by using the data
[25:57.880 --> 26:02.880]  from one single weather event but it's funny that isn't it because whenever
[26:02.880 --> 26:07.880]  there's a hot weather event like Russia experienced in the summer just gone
[26:07.880 --> 26:13.880]  that also cause the Pakistani floods the global warming alarmists immediately
[26:13.880 --> 26:18.880]  sees upon that weather event which they say can't be used to improve global
[26:18.880 --> 26:24.880]  warming one way or another as evidence of global warming again any weather
[26:24.880 --> 26:30.880]  tornadoes record freezing sizzling hot summer temperatures floods tornadoes
[26:30.880 --> 26:34.880]  earthquakes any just anything that's all never happened before in the natural
[26:34.880 --> 26:39.880]  geological history of the planet it's only just started to happen and it's all
[26:39.880 --> 26:44.880]  our fault so we've got to pay carbon taxes to Al Gore and to the massive
[26:44.880 --> 26:49.880]  climate exchanges that they profit in the hundreds of millions of dollars from
[26:49.880 --> 26:54.880]  again get it get it into your head freezing is part of the warming do you
[26:54.880 --> 27:03.880]  understand black is why now another thing they're coming out with again
[27:03.880 --> 27:09.880]  the more discredited they become the more ridiculously stupid and bold their
[27:09.880 --> 27:15.880]  proclamations are they're now saying that 2010 is the hottest year since records
[27:15.880 --> 27:22.880]  began and this myth is being promulgated by dr. James Hansen of NASA
[27:22.880 --> 27:28.880]  this is the guy who gave glowing approvals to books written by fellow alarmist
[27:28.880 --> 27:34.880]  that call for environmental terrorism blowing up bridges and returning man to
[27:34.880 --> 27:40.880]  the stone age that's a good idea to save the planet obviously again 2010 so
[27:40.880 --> 27:49.880]  called hottest year ever since records beyond total fabrication three studies
[27:49.880 --> 27:55.880]  said the global temperatures had cooled by point three degrees Celsius in
[27:55.880 --> 28:02.880]  2010 one study the one led by Hansen said that global temperatures in 2010
[28:02.880 --> 28:09.880]  had increased by 0.2 degrees Celsius now the funny thing about it is that as
[28:09.880 --> 28:14.880]  Anthony what's over over what's up with that the premier global warming
[28:14.880 --> 28:23.880]  skeptic website along with Mark Marano's climate depot proves 75% of the
[28:23.880 --> 28:27.880]  temperature data that Hansen used to proclaim that this was the hottest year
[28:27.880 --> 28:33.880]  on record was completely contrived oh is that any surprise with these people
[28:33.880 --> 28:39.880]  you know hide the decline these are the climate gate crux that twist the data to
[28:39.880 --> 28:44.880]  suit their own agenda and basically they didn't even have 75% of the
[28:44.880 --> 28:49.880]  temperature data in so they just basically made it up and these you've
[28:49.880 --> 28:53.880]  got these three other studies saying the opposite and guess which one the
[28:53.880 --> 28:59.880]  associate press and the establishment media chose to give traction to to the
[28:59.880 --> 29:02.880]  other three studies that all agreed that global temperatures had
[29:02.880 --> 29:08.880]  significantly dipped by 0.3 degrees now of course they went for the
[29:08.880 --> 29:15.880]  manufactured contrived 75% data one which said that temperatures had increased
[29:15.880 --> 29:20.880]  by 0.2% and that this was the hottest year on record why because obviously it
[29:20.880 --> 29:24.880]  backs up their global warming myth that they're now fully invested in and
[29:24.880 --> 29:28.880]  that is being used to push towards your total enslavement and the lowering of
[29:28.880 --> 29:33.880]  your living standards we'll be back with Ted Anderson and more news in the
[29:33.880 --> 29:49.880]  upcoming after break prisonplanet.tv stay tuned with Alex Jones
[29:49.880 --> 29:59.880]  we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network
[29:59.880 --> 30:03.880]  this is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar
[30:03.880 --> 30:07.880]  power generator number one new climate legislation could easily double or
[30:07.880 --> 30:11.880]  triple your electric bill number two our new energy czar wants to control how
[30:11.880 --> 30:15.880]  much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total
[30:15.880 --> 30:19.880]  government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is
[30:19.880 --> 30:23.880]  coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously
[30:23.880 --> 30:27.880]  overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the
[30:27.880 --> 30:31.880]  problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids
[30:31.880 --> 30:34.880]  every year thousands of families lose their power from weather related
[30:34.880 --> 30:38.880]  onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup
[30:38.880 --> 30:41.880]  insurance and peace of mind folks I really believe in the solar power
[30:41.880 --> 30:45.880]  generators offered by solutions from science one of my oldest sponsors you

[30:59.880 --> 31:03.880]  you've heard Alex explain how the silver lungs generator infuses the
[31:03.880 --> 31:07.880]  respiratory system with yourself produced colloidal silver solutions yet
[31:07.880 --> 31:10.880]  many are unaware of the entire function of the silver lung system and how it has
[31:10.880 --> 31:15.880]  been designed to deliver your silver solutions anywhere in or on the body
[31:15.880 --> 31:19.880]  my name is Mario Safaldi and I'm the developer of the silver lungs generator
[31:19.880 --> 31:23.880]  not only does the silver lung system produce endless colloidal and ionic
[31:23.880 --> 31:27.880]  silver solutions it also comes equipped with the proper applicators and
[31:27.880 --> 31:32.880]  devices needed to deliver your silver solutions directly to key target areas
[31:32.880 --> 31:39.880]  this includes the eyes ears nose lungs topically to the skin and orally for
[31:39.880 --> 31:43.880]  the digestive system be sure to watch our new seven-minute video tour of the
[31:43.880 --> 31:49.880]  silver lung system at www.silverlungs.com to learn more about how the
[31:49.880 --> 31:54.880]  silver lung system works as well we are always ready to answer any questions you

[32:54.880 --> 33:00.880]  for buying a one to two month soap sampler thank you
[33:24.880 --> 33:38.880]  the Alex Jones show when everybody wants to rule the world and the bankers
[33:38.880 --> 33:43.880]  certainly want to rule over the control and manipulation of precious metals
[33:43.880 --> 33:48.880]  we're about to go to Ted Anderson but this revolution against the bankers
[33:48.880 --> 33:54.880]  with Americans across the country buying physical silver is really starting to
[33:54.880 --> 34:00.880]  catch fire we're going to go to a clip now Ted Anderson after this clip
[34:00.880 --> 34:06.880]  you're watching why silver why now never in the history of mankind has one nation
[34:06.880 --> 34:11.880]  engaged in such a rapid descent in 1980 the United States was the world's
[34:11.880 --> 34:16.880]  largest creditor nation today it's the largest debtor not only in the world
[34:16.880 --> 34:20.880]  but in history of the world we have witnessed massive corruption across
[34:20.880 --> 34:25.880]  all areas of society from the Enron scandal to Bernie Madoff to trillions
[34:25.880 --> 34:29.880]  missing from the Pentagon as Donald Rumsfeld publicly admitted on September
[34:29.880 --> 34:34.880]  10th 2001 the aim of this micro doc is to help everyone not only recognize
[34:34.880 --> 34:38.880]  how dire the situation has become for America but also to help you understand
[34:38.880 --> 34:42.880]  that there is something you can do today in order to provide some measure of
[34:42.880 --> 34:46.880]  protection for you and your family so here are the facts the corruption in
[34:46.880 --> 34:50.880]  our financial markets has been so widespread for so long that it has
[34:50.880 --> 34:54.880]  actually created opportunity for the properly informed because the Federal
[34:54.880 --> 34:57.880]  Reserve owns the printing presses which pump out our paper dollars the
[34:57.880 --> 35:01.880]  controlling class has for years suppressed the free market prices of gold
[35:01.880 --> 35:05.880]  and silver in order to keep their paper dollars unrivaled yet like a canary
[35:05.880 --> 35:09.880]  in a coal mine the rising prices of gold and silver are signaling that
[35:09.880 --> 35:13.880]  something is wrong so the bankers have flooded the market with paper
[35:13.880 --> 35:17.880]  representations of gold and silver in a coordinated scheme to keep those
[35:17.880 --> 35:22.880]  prices down thus keeping that canary alive and people say well there's and
[35:22.880 --> 35:26.880]  you've heard it today there's not that much physical metal out there there
[35:26.880 --> 35:31.880]  isn't but in the physical market as the market uses that term there is much
[35:31.880 --> 35:35.880]  more metal than that there's a hundred times what there is but it's no longer
[35:35.880 --> 35:39.880]  working the bankers are losing the battle precious metals are financial assets
[35:39.880 --> 35:44.880]  and like currencies and T bills and T bonds they trade in the multiples of
[35:44.880 --> 35:48.880]  a hundred times the underlying physical investors and hedge fund vigilantes
[35:48.880 --> 35:52.880]  around the world now know about the banker scheme and the result is nothing
[35:52.880 --> 35:56.880]  short of revolutionary people from all walks of life around the world are now
[35:56.880 --> 36:01.880]  buying physical gold and silver and rejecting the paper metal I own physical
[36:01.880 --> 36:07.880]  silver physical silver I own physical silver physical silver I own physical
[36:07.880 --> 36:12.880]  silver I own physical add to that even a few nation states actively acquiring
[36:12.880 --> 36:17.880]  physical metal and it all adds up to yet another paper Ponzi scheme collapsing
[36:17.880 --> 36:21.880]  this one built of paper metal what is happening right now is causing this
[36:21.880 --> 36:26.880]  decades-long scheme to unravel and when it's fully exposed it will prove to be
[36:26.880 --> 36:31.880]  the biggest financial fraud in world history so if you purchase silver a year
[36:31.880 --> 36:35.880]  or two ago and you've doubled your money do you sell now if you're new to this
[36:35.880 --> 36:41.880]  and don't own any do you buy well here are the facts you decide the industrial
[36:41.880 --> 36:45.880]  demand for silver has been growing year in and year out draining some 800
[36:45.880 --> 36:49.880]  million ounces of physical silver from world markets every year with a
[36:49.880 --> 36:53.880]  worldwide mining production only providing approximately 550 million
[36:53.880 --> 36:57.880]  ounces per year you can see the problem the United States government owned
[36:57.880 --> 37:03.880]  2 billion ounces of silver in 1990 today it has zero there is not enough
[37:03.880 --> 37:07.880]  physical silver to meet industrial demand or investor demand in fact to
[37:07.880 --> 37:11.880]  re-channel investor interest in silver away from physical and into yet more
[37:11.880 --> 37:15.880]  paper JP Morgan the very bank being investigated by the Department of
[37:15.880 --> 37:20.880]  Justice for fraud created the SLV ETF a paper tiger which according to the
[37:20.880 --> 37:24.880]  esteemed Harvey organ and other researchers like this one who have read
[37:24.880 --> 37:29.880]  the SLV prospectus the SLV listed on the NYSE has no physical silver behind
[37:29.880 --> 37:33.880]  it and when the paper Ponzi finally collapses those holding paper
[37:33.880 --> 37:37.880]  representations of silver through the SLV will find they are listed as
[37:37.880 --> 37:43.880]  unsecured creditors so what does it all mean well here's the deal or well said
[37:43.880 --> 37:48.880]  in a time of universal deceit telling the truth is a revolutionary act we are
[37:48.880 --> 37:52.880]  now living in a time of massive deceit Americans are quickly losing
[37:52.880 --> 37:56.880]  confidence in their financial markets in their media and in their government
[37:56.880 --> 38:00.880]  and the creditor nations to whom we owe trillions are starting to lose
[38:00.880 --> 38:06.880]  confidence in our dollar so why physical silver the reasons are obvious the
[38:06.880 --> 38:14.880]  next steps are yours thanks for watching why silver why now
[38:14.880 --> 38:19.880]  and there you have it I mean we've got the globalists at every turn JP Morgan
[38:19.880 --> 38:25.880]  George Soros trying to badmouth gold and silver while pumping out these paper
[38:25.880 --> 38:31.880]  instruments to artificially suppress the price so they can ultimately hoard
[38:31.880 --> 38:38.880]  all the physical supplies but we've got Ted Anderson joining us now and Ted I
[38:38.880 --> 38:42.880]  mean the jigs the jigs up isn't it I mean as a result of this campaign led
[38:42.880 --> 38:48.880]  by Max Kaiser and others we've got JP Morgan having to publicly reduce
[38:48.880 --> 38:54.880]  their position in silver and this backdoor manipulation of precious metals
[38:54.880 --> 38:59.880]  is really starting to be pushed out into the open why it sure is become
[38:59.880 --> 39:06.880]  more more widely known that the central banks of the world have been in
[39:06.880 --> 39:10.880]  manipulating gold and silver trying to suppress the prices and trying to
[39:10.880 --> 39:14.880]  break their fiat currency you got to remember JP Morgan Goldman Sachs
[39:14.880 --> 39:18.880]  even Wells Fargo they're all member banks of the Federal Reserve there it's
[39:18.880 --> 39:22.880]  a cartel not a whole lot different than the cartels you you know you
[39:22.880 --> 39:25.880]  watching the movie when you're when you're when you're when you're looking
[39:25.880 --> 39:30.880]  at the gangster flicks you know it's a cartel these people control currencies
[39:30.880 --> 39:34.880]  and they want to continue to maintain that control and as people buy
[39:34.880 --> 39:40.880]  gold and silver and start trading that amongst each other as as a currency
[39:40.880 --> 39:45.880]  they lose that control it is the only game that they have and they the only
[39:45.880 --> 39:49.880]  thing they have to fuel their their their scheme is a printing press they
[39:49.880 --> 39:53.880]  can make as much money as they want they can create it out of thin air they
[39:53.880 --> 39:58.880]  get to create it from nothing there's no labor in the process of doing so and
[39:58.880 --> 40:02.880]  they get to collect interest from the entire nation and really they're trying
[40:02.880 --> 40:06.880]  to build it into the entire world so we all labor for them like slaves
[40:06.880 --> 40:10.880]  off of something that they create from nothing you know it's it's no it's no
[40:10.880 --> 40:15.880]  question of you know it's no doubt that the United States debt problem
[40:15.880 --> 40:19.880]  evolved from the Federal Reserve system in their cartel and it's and the same
[40:19.880 --> 40:23.880]  thing is true in London with the Bank of England and all these different
[40:23.880 --> 40:28.880]  banks across the entire world for some reason in 1913 we decided to go to
[40:28.880 --> 40:34.880]  this fiat money system where we have bankers that are creating currency and
[40:34.880 --> 40:40.880]  you know it just it simply took the power from the hands of the people and
[40:40.880 --> 40:44.880]  handed it over to this elite group and they fight amongst each other and so on
[40:44.880 --> 40:47.880]  and so forth but I can tell you one thing for sure they all have the same
[40:47.880 --> 40:51.880]  common denominator they all want to see the United States dollar and the
[40:51.880 --> 40:56.880]  currencies of the world stay in control and not see gold and silver take back
[40:56.880 --> 41:02.880]  over what it used to have previous to 1913 or going all the way up to 1971
[41:02.880 --> 41:06.880]  here in the United States where Nixon took us off the gold standard but you
[41:06.880 --> 41:11.880]  know right now the French are losing their triple A grade rating on their
[41:11.880 --> 41:15.880]  bonds on their debt and they're going to be a subclass now it's like you know
[41:15.880 --> 41:21.880]  you we've got this erosion of you know the of the monetary system in Europe
[41:21.880 --> 41:26.880]  and and the French are the next in line to fail you know we've seen we've seen
[41:26.880 --> 41:31.880]  first of all we've seen the Greek crisis and now it's spread to you know it's
[41:31.880 --> 41:36.880]  spread to the United Kingdom and in that area now France so you know and and the
[41:36.880 --> 41:39.880]  funny thing is the United States dollars gaining some strength because of it
[41:39.880 --> 41:43.880]  but the United States dollars in a free fall just means that the French
[41:43.880 --> 41:47.880]  currency is falling faster which is obviously the year all the the French's
[41:47.880 --> 41:51.880]  currency is falling faster than the United States dollar and propping up the
[41:51.880 --> 41:55.880]  dollar in the process it's it's so crazy this whole thing but we're talking
[41:55.880 --> 42:01.880]  about silver I tell you Paul the the the the best thing that people can do and
[42:01.880 --> 42:04.880]  and this and I'm not kidding about this I mean there's so many people out there
[42:04.880 --> 42:07.880]  out there going well I can't afford silver don't know what I can do with it
[42:07.880 --> 42:13.880]  you know I put together a package that just makes it absolutely so easy to buy
[42:13.880 --> 42:18.880]  I mean 97 dollars I'm delivering three silver dollars and these are the silver
[42:18.880 --> 42:22.880]  dollars that were used here in this country as constitutional money between
[42:22.880 --> 42:29.880]  1776 all the way up till 1964 I'm talking about the real silver money that was
[42:29.880 --> 42:34.880]  intended by our forefathers here in the United States for us to use so the
[42:34.880 --> 42:37.880]  government doesn't have the printing press and do what they're doing right now
[42:37.880 --> 42:42.880]  and and those three silver dollars I match them with three of Alex's best
[42:42.880 --> 42:48.880]  videos the Obama deception follow the Republic and endgame all tied together
[42:48.880 --> 42:52.880]  in one package where you can get the the videos and these are not copies of the
[42:52.880 --> 42:57.880]  videos I've been to several of these you know functions like 9-11 events and so
[42:57.880 --> 43:01.880]  on and so forth where people are handing out videos and they make copies and put
[43:01.880 --> 43:04.880]  them in a paper sleeve and they tell people that you know to watch this
[43:04.880 --> 43:08.880]  video and on the front of it you'll see a marker that says endgame on it you
[43:08.880 --> 43:13.880]  know these are the ones that are actually sealed in the plastic brand new
[43:13.880 --> 43:18.880]  videos brand new productions of the Alex Jones and company and I just need to
[43:18.880 --> 43:22.880]  say people need to be getting involved I mean get away from this fiat money
[43:22.880 --> 43:26.880]  system you're actually by doing so you're fighting the fight you're getting
[43:26.880 --> 43:30.880]  into gold and silver which was intended for you to use the people here in the
[43:30.880 --> 43:34.880]  United States learned an awfully big lesson when the continental currency
[43:34.880 --> 43:38.880]  failed and it failed because of the printing press and now the United
[43:38.880 --> 43:42.880]  States dollar the Federal Reserve note is failing for the same reason we've
[43:42.880 --> 43:46.880]  driven ourselves way too far into debt we have way too much liability to pay
[43:46.880 --> 43:50.880]  there's no way the United States can ever do it we sold our children's future
[43:50.880 --> 43:56.880]  sad as that sounds and the only answer to this is to get back to precious
[43:56.880 --> 44:01.880]  metals as money take that darn printing press away from our politicians we
[44:01.880 --> 44:06.880]  just need to do that because the politicians will continue to invent
[44:06.880 --> 44:12.880]  new legislation and have absolutely no restriction to financially to what they
[44:12.880 --> 44:16.880]  do because they have this darn printing press you're going to continue to see
[44:16.880 --> 44:20.880]  bad ideas come out of Washington DC and put our children further on the hook
[44:20.880 --> 44:24.880]  and until that printing press is gone this is going to go this way and with
[44:24.880 --> 44:29.880]  the printing press you also have to end this cartel of the Federal Reserve
[44:29.880 --> 44:34.880]  Bank and its bank branches I did you know I you're in you're in Europe and I
[44:34.880 --> 44:38.880]  don't even know how you're going to start to end that that Rothschild bank
[44:38.880 --> 44:42.880]  they call the Bank of England but here in the United States we have a
[44:42.880 --> 44:46.880]  Constitution that clearly describes that we should be using gold and silver as
[44:46.880 --> 44:51.880]  money the founding father said that this is how this should be gold and silver
[44:51.880 --> 44:56.880]  coins and left to the power of the state to coin that the to coin you know
[44:56.880 --> 45:00.880]  gold and silver coins as money as soon as we got away from that you know as a
[45:00.880 --> 45:03.880]  treasonous act and the people that decided to set up this Federal Reserve
[45:03.880 --> 45:09.880]  System actually had to travel incognito not even using their own names to meet
[45:09.880 --> 45:14.880]  down in Jekyll Island to get this thing going it just absolutely stinks of
[45:14.880 --> 45:21.880]  corruption and you know anyways I'm blowing my horn long way too long
[45:21.880 --> 45:25.880]  here if you're interested in buying the silver dollars for ninety seven dollars

[47:09.880 --> 47:15.880]  taken away from us I mean we're we're we're slaves to a cartel to a to a system

[47:19.880 --> 47:24.880]  something and siphon off your labor for it you know just it it's depleting the
[47:24.880 --> 47:27.880]  assets of the United States of America just shouldn't be this way and it
[47:27.880 --> 47:31.880]  doesn't have to be this way it wasn't designed to be this way it is absolutely
[47:31.880 --> 47:36.880]  unconstitutional that we've gone where we have you know the Federal Reserve Act
[47:36.880 --> 47:41.880]  was not a constitutional amendment that's that means that it does not override
[47:41.880 --> 47:45.880]  that the mandate of the Constitution that says that we should be using gold and
[47:45.880 --> 47:50.880]  silver as money but yet here it is because they're so powerful there they
[47:50.880 --> 47:54.880]  have their hands in the pockets of our politicians so deeply that they're able
[47:54.880 --> 48:00.880]  to get get away with something that's absolutely unconstitutional okay

[48:24.880 --> 48:30.880]  offer thanks to Ted Anderson. Quick call before the break let's go to
[48:30.880 --> 48:35.880]  Ben in Texas Ben you're on the air. Hey Paul how are you doing I just wanted to say
[48:35.880 --> 48:40.880]  I've called what you're doing speaking out about government abuse of power and
[48:40.880 --> 48:46.880]  public deceit I wish the public would use your analogy of the allegory of the
[48:46.880 --> 48:53.880]  cave more but I just wanted to shed some light on Travis County CPS where
[48:53.880 --> 48:59.880]  the state is abusing constitutional rights and I'm a perfect example of
[48:59.880 --> 49:05.880]  prison planet where all it took was a state worker to make a false accusation
[49:05.880 --> 49:13.880]  against me submit a document to the court accusing me of something that
[49:13.880 --> 49:19.880]  wasn't true then CPS took my newborn daughter placed her in my brother's
[49:19.880 --> 49:25.880]  custody this was all made on false grounds placed her in my brother's
[49:25.880 --> 49:32.880]  custody they gave me three days to decide this once I once I she was in my
[49:32.880 --> 49:37.880]  brother's custody I told CPS I didn't want her there she was you know they were
[49:37.880 --> 49:43.880]  using drugs and alcohol and it was an unsafe environment two weeks later she
[49:43.880 --> 49:47.880]  died and and this is all because state officials are fabricating sworn
[49:47.880 --> 49:53.880]  documents and you know the CPS system is not only a pedophilia playground it's
[49:53.880 --> 50:03.880]  a government cash cow and the state doesn't have the public protection in
[50:03.880 --> 50:06.880]  mind that they care about protecting themselves and and that's what it's
[50:06.880 --> 50:11.880]  coming for more and more every day and you've got this judge down here in
[50:11.880 --> 50:17.880]  Travis County signing these willy nilly orders Judge Byrne and no one is
[50:17.880 --> 50:23.880]  there to oversee how she's violating federal constitutional rights of due
[50:23.880 --> 50:27.880]  process and so forth and I just want to say that and I just want to say that
[50:27.880 --> 50:31.880]  Paul what you're doing thank you okay thanks Ben yeah I mean it's all part of

[55:52.880 --> 55:57.880]  petition signatures in order to be able to place candidates on the ballot and
[55:57.880 --> 56:03.880]  in Maryland you have to get 10,000 signatures from registered voters in
[56:03.880 --> 56:08.880]  order to have your party qualified for the ballot and then once you get
[56:08.880 --> 56:14.880]  ballot status you you have to get a certain percent of the vote in the
[56:14.880 --> 56:20.880]  governor's race in order to maintain ballot status and if you don't hit that
[56:20.880 --> 56:24.880]  vote threshold of the governor's race you have to do another petition to
[56:24.880 --> 56:29.880]  re-qualify for the next election cycle and in order to keep your party on the
[56:29.880 --> 56:34.880]  ballot and not lose all of your registered voters that is the people who
[56:34.880 --> 56:41.880]  checked your party box on the voter registration form you have to have that
[56:41.880 --> 56:46.880]  petition completed by January 2nd so myself and some other people here in
[56:46.880 --> 56:50.880]  the libertarian party of Maryland have been gathering these petition
[56:50.880 --> 56:57.880]  signatures and this weekend I was in a place called Ellicott City, Maryland
[56:57.880 --> 57:02.880]  and I was in which is in Howard County and I was in front of a library there
[57:02.880 --> 57:07.880]  and the librarian came out and told me that I had to leave that I
[57:07.880 --> 57:12.880]  couldn't I couldn't do this there now I happen to know that we have a legal
[57:12.880 --> 57:16.880]  right to do this and in fact we have done this at other libraries in Maryland
[57:16.880 --> 57:23.880]  and including in Howard County and didn't have any problems there's also
[57:23.880 --> 57:29.880]  some court rulings that have gone down in our favor two of which I know of in
[57:29.880 --> 57:35.880]  the state of Maryland one of them was a court ruling against the Maryland
[57:35.880 --> 57:41.880]  Transit Authority and this this was on behalf of the group Acorn which was
[57:41.880 --> 57:48.880]  out doing voter registration drives and the ACLU of Maryland took their case
[57:48.880 --> 57:52.880]  and they won the Maryland Transit Authority was saying that they couldn't
[57:52.880 --> 57:56.880]  do their voter registration activities at these transit stops that is bus
[57:56.880 --> 58:01.880]  stops subway stops in Maryland and they went so what happened to you did they
[58:01.880 --> 58:06.880]  make you leave or did you stand put I tried to explain this to the librarian
[58:06.880 --> 58:09.880]  and she wouldn't listen to me and I tried to show her the paperwork and she
[58:09.880 --> 58:13.880]  wouldn't she wouldn't look at my paperwork and then she called the police
[58:13.880 --> 58:19.880]  and so the police came out and the first cop came out and I told I am I
[58:19.880 --> 58:22.880]  showed them the paperwork they wouldn't look at it and I told them what I'm
[58:22.880 --> 58:26.880]  supposed to have a legal right to be here and the cops said okay well the
[58:26.880 --> 58:30.880]  sergeant's going to come out so tell us how the story ends after the break

[01:00:27.880 --> 01:00:32.880]  December 20th so Andy you're there outside the library you're on public property
[01:00:32.880 --> 01:00:37.880]  you're collecting signatures for a libertarian party election and the
[01:00:37.880 --> 01:00:42.880]  librarian calls the police tell us how the story ends
[01:00:42.880 --> 01:00:48.880]  okay then then the police sergeant came out and I tried to show the police sergeant
[01:00:48.880 --> 01:00:53.880]  the paperwork which I had the the acorn court ruling there was also another court
[01:00:53.880 --> 01:00:58.880]  ruling in favor of the Lyndon LaRouche supporters against the Maryland motor
[01:00:58.880 --> 01:01:03.880]  vehicles place and then there's also a federal court ruling called grown versus
[01:01:03.880 --> 01:01:07.880]  saying and in that federal court ruling it included libraries I tried to show
[01:01:07.880 --> 01:01:11.880]  this to them they wouldn't look at it I also had a letter from the head of the
[01:01:11.880 --> 01:01:16.880]  Howard County library that said that they'd acknowledged that we were allowed
[01:01:16.880 --> 01:01:20.880]  to collect the signatures there anyway they wouldn't look at any of this stuff
[01:01:20.880 --> 01:01:24.880]  and the police sergeant said that I had to leave and I said okay fine
[01:01:24.880 --> 01:01:29.880]  I'll leave but before I go I just would like to get some evidence of this so I
[01:01:29.880 --> 01:01:34.880]  can present it to our attorneys and so I told them that I was going to video
[01:01:34.880 --> 01:01:38.880]  video them telling me to leave on my cell phone my cell phone has a video camera
[01:01:38.880 --> 01:01:44.880]  so I pulled out my cell phone and I was I was about to start video on them
[01:01:44.880 --> 01:01:49.880]  telling me to leave and then the police sergeant grabbed me
[01:01:49.880 --> 01:01:54.880]  and he tried to rip the cell phone out of my hands and then the other cop grabbed
[01:01:54.880 --> 01:01:59.880]  me and they were trying to rip the phone away from me so I couldn't record it
[01:01:59.880 --> 01:02:03.880]  and then while they were trying to rip the phones out of my hands the police
[01:02:03.880 --> 01:02:08.880]  sergeant pulled out a can of mace and he sprayed me in the eyes and then they
[01:02:08.880 --> 01:02:12.880]  put my arms behind my back and they handcuffed me and they put the handcuffs
[01:02:12.880 --> 01:02:17.880]  on pretty tight and then they they they were they were questioning me they
[01:02:17.880 --> 01:02:22.880]  were searching through my stuff and I was handcuffed in front of a library
[01:02:22.880 --> 01:02:26.880]  they said they were going to take me to the jail and while they were doing this
[01:02:26.880 --> 01:02:29.880]  I was saying well what have I done wrong what crime has been committed here
[01:02:29.880 --> 01:02:33.880]  I mean did I engage in an act of violence you know theft or destruction of
[01:02:33.880 --> 01:02:37.880]  property and they wouldn't answer me and then I said well who is the victim of
[01:02:37.880 --> 01:02:41.880]  this crime and they wouldn't answer me and I kept asking him that and then finally
[01:02:41.880 --> 01:02:45.880]  the police sergeant said the state of Maryland is the victim and I said well
[01:02:45.880 --> 01:02:49.880]  it's the state government that requires us to get these petition signatures
[01:02:49.880 --> 01:02:53.880]  this is a legal requirement we have to fulfill to be able to run candidates
[01:02:53.880 --> 01:02:57.880]  and then he wouldn't answer me again and then I asked him if he took an oath to
[01:02:57.880 --> 01:03:01.880]  defend the Constitution because I asked what he did with the First Amendment
[01:03:01.880 --> 01:03:07.880]  and he wouldn't answer me and then they took me to the jail and they put leg
[01:03:07.880 --> 01:03:13.880]  cuffs on me and I was I was kept in the in the jail there in Howard County
[01:03:13.880 --> 01:03:19.880]  for several hours they put me in a cell they fingerprinted me and I was
[01:03:19.880 --> 01:03:23.880]  released a few hours later but I had to sit in jail for several hours and they
[01:03:23.880 --> 01:03:29.880]  released me just out on the street my car I didn't have my car so I had to
[01:03:29.880 --> 01:03:36.880]  walk and find a phone and find somebody who could who could come and get me
[01:03:36.880 --> 01:03:41.880]  and I had to go get my stuff but anyway now they're saying that I have to
[01:03:41.880 --> 01:03:50.880]  appear in court on March 19th and or or I'm going to have to pay a $2,000 fine
[01:03:50.880 --> 01:03:55.880]  and they're charging me with trespassing and they're saying that I was soliciting
[01:03:55.880 --> 01:03:59.880]  even though I clearly told them I was petitioning I showed them the petition
[01:03:59.880 --> 01:04:03.880]  I was not soliciting petitioning or not the same thing and they said that I was
[01:04:03.880 --> 01:04:08.880]  resisting arrest even though they they just grabbed me and tried to rip the camera

[01:09:04.880 --> 01:09:08.880]  writings and your work on prisonplanet.com as well.
[01:09:08.880 --> 01:09:14.880]  Thanks Joel appreciate that I was reading your world affairs brief when I
[01:09:14.880 --> 01:09:19.880]  received it on Friday and the primary concern in this issue is of course the
[01:09:19.880 --> 01:09:25.880]  so-called Bush tax cuts which of course you know in reality are no tax cuts at
[01:09:25.880 --> 01:09:31.880]  all at best they're a kind of stop-gap continuation of the same policies and in
[01:09:31.880 --> 01:09:36.880]  fact as you document in a number of ways we'll actually end up fleecing the
[01:09:36.880 --> 01:09:42.880]  American people to an even greater extent. I mean explain to the listeners
[01:09:42.880 --> 01:09:48.880]  the price that Republicans have paid to the Obama administration merely to
[01:09:48.880 --> 01:09:53.880]  continue basically what was already in place with these tax cuts.
[01:09:53.880 --> 01:09:59.880]  Yes it's a very important point that this really isn't you know a tax cut for
[01:09:59.880 --> 01:10:03.880]  the wealthy or for anybody really this is this was going to be a tax increase
[01:10:03.880 --> 01:10:08.880]  taxes going up on January 1st but it's interesting because this really wouldn't
[01:10:08.880 --> 01:10:16.880]  have taken place any of these tax increases until the following year and
[01:10:16.880 --> 01:10:20.880]  you'd have a whole year for the Congress to work on these and to get them back
[01:10:20.880 --> 01:10:25.880]  in place. So the Republicans played as if they were being held hostage by the
[01:10:25.880 --> 01:10:28.880]  Democrats that these things had to be passed during the lame cut and duck
[01:10:28.880 --> 01:10:32.880]  session let's say go into effect in January 1st but it would have been
[01:10:32.880 --> 01:10:36.880]  just as easy for the Republicans to wait until they install a new Congress
[01:10:36.880 --> 01:10:41.880]  where they have control over the public purse in January late January and they
[01:10:41.880 --> 01:10:44.880]  could have simply made it retroactive to January 1st so there really was no
[01:10:44.880 --> 01:10:49.880]  pressure to exceed to these demands of Obama and what they did in this
[01:10:49.880 --> 01:10:57.880]  devil's deal is first of all made a secret agreement to in essence not or
[01:10:57.880 --> 01:11:04.880]  they agreed to fund the Congress the federal spending or budget through
[01:11:04.880 --> 01:11:08.880]  September of 2011 and that would have included of course funding for
[01:11:08.880 --> 01:11:13.880]  Obamacare which is the only way that the Republicans could have stopped
[01:11:13.880 --> 01:11:17.880]  Obamacare from going into place to stop the funding of the various tax
[01:11:17.880 --> 01:11:21.880]  provisions that are involved there. In addition they allowed Obama to talk
[01:11:21.880 --> 01:11:28.880]  them into a massive increase in the state tax one of the most hated
[01:11:28.880 --> 01:11:34.880]  taxes that America because essentially it's double taxation you pay according
[01:11:34.880 --> 01:11:40.880]  to the agreement 35% of anything over $5 million that would have accrued
[01:11:40.880 --> 01:11:44.880]  and that's money that you already paid taxes on so the state tax was
[01:11:44.880 --> 01:11:48.880]  actually down to zero and that's a major increase to bring that back up to
[01:11:48.880 --> 01:11:59.880]  the 35% range but fortunately this had a partially happy ending that the
[01:11:59.880 --> 01:12:05.880]  commitment that the Republicans made to go along with the continuing
[01:12:05.880 --> 01:12:10.880]  resolution the omnibus spending bill was filled with so much pork and a lot of
[01:12:10.880 --> 01:12:15.880]  that was because of Republicans requesting various pork barrel things
[01:12:15.880 --> 01:12:18.880]  being added to the bill that Mitch McConnell ended up in the Senate
[01:12:18.880 --> 01:12:22.880]  being very very embarrassed when it came out in fact that he had demanded
[01:12:22.880 --> 01:12:26.880]  a lot of these things and so he reneged on his agreement with Obama and
[01:12:26.880 --> 01:12:31.880]  turned around and put in a one-page continuing resolution basically
[01:12:31.880 --> 01:12:36.880]  says we'll fund the government through the first few months of the next
[01:12:36.880 --> 01:12:41.880]  year and then we'll take it up again as a Congress and what this shows
[01:12:41.880 --> 01:12:44.880]  Paul of course is that we cannot trust the Republicans really to do what
[01:12:44.880 --> 01:12:48.880]  they said in their pledge they were going to stop spending they were not
[01:12:48.880 --> 01:12:51.880]  going to have any omnibus bills that are going to pass everything
[01:12:51.880 --> 01:12:56.880]  individually none of that is true as of this date and of course we'll have
[01:12:56.880 --> 01:13:01.880]  to see what they do after this pressure continues in January when they take
[01:13:01.880 --> 01:13:08.880]  office so so basically eviscerate if you get past five million dollars
[01:13:08.880 --> 01:13:12.880]  throughout the course of your life it eviscerates your savings by taxing
[01:13:12.880 --> 01:13:17.880]  what's already been taxed on your income I mean Joel I mean where do they
[01:13:17.880 --> 01:13:22.880]  get off on double taxing Americans wealth that's already been taxed isn't
[01:13:22.880 --> 01:13:27.880]  that illegal well actually you know that's interesting there really is
[01:13:27.880 --> 01:13:31.880]  no law that says you can't double tax something it's a principle that has
[01:13:31.880 --> 01:13:35.880]  been in vogue in America since the American Revolution but it's been
[01:13:35.880 --> 01:13:40.880]  violated ever since the estate tax was passed and they did so of course
[01:13:40.880 --> 01:13:45.880]  under the old populist notion of taxing the rich it's very very difficult
[01:13:45.880 --> 01:13:50.880]  for people to realize how evil it is to tax only a sector the sector that
[01:13:50.880 --> 01:13:55.880]  doesn't go or my ox so to speak and that's what the American people have
[01:13:55.880 --> 01:14:00.880]  engaged in it took us years to get rid of the estate tax and then they only
[01:14:00.880 --> 01:14:04.880]  made it a temporary you know getting rid of them now it's coming back so we're
[01:14:04.880 --> 01:14:08.880]  going to get the tax deal did pass and by the way they did increase the
[01:14:08.880 --> 01:14:13.880]  limit up to ten million dollars at the last minute in order to placate those
[01:14:13.880 --> 01:14:17.880]  that were very very incensed about the estate tax but still what worries me
[01:14:17.880 --> 01:14:21.880]  of course is that if you start to get hyperinflation in the United States
[01:14:21.880 --> 01:14:25.880]  everybody's the state could rise within a few years to ten million dollars so
[01:14:25.880 --> 01:14:29.880]  there's no real great safety in having that exemption amount
[01:14:29.880 --> 01:14:35.880]  I mean that's exactly the point they cry you know let's tax the rich to fix
[01:14:35.880 --> 01:14:41.880]  all these deficits in the budget and yet they define the rich as people
[01:14:41.880 --> 01:14:45.880]  earning two hundred thousand dollars it's like in Britain
[01:14:45.880 --> 01:14:49.880]  they define the rich as anyone who earns over a hundred thousand
[01:14:49.880 --> 01:14:54.880]  pounds and then they take fifty percent of their income I mean that's the
[01:14:54.880 --> 01:14:59.880]  middle class you're not taxing the rich if anyone above two hundred thousand
[01:14:59.880 --> 01:15:03.880]  dollars has to give most most of their income to the federal government
[01:15:03.880 --> 01:15:08.880]  it's amazing we had an article written by Ron Paul which we posted on the
[01:15:08.880 --> 01:15:13.880]  website about these tax cuts not tax cuts just a continuation of the same policy
[01:15:13.880 --> 01:15:18.880]  and in fact an introduction again a reintroduction of the estate tax
[01:15:18.880 --> 01:15:23.880]  and he said that all this thrashing about on the minutiae of this policy
[01:15:23.880 --> 01:15:29.880]  was again taking the focus away from the real engine of substantive
[01:15:29.880 --> 01:15:33.880]  monetary manipulation and oppression of the American people which of course
[01:15:33.880 --> 01:15:39.880]  is the federal reserve of the income tax and Paul points out that for a hundred
[01:15:39.880 --> 01:15:43.880]  and twenty years the federal government was funded with excise taxes and the
[01:15:43.880 --> 01:15:49.880]  income tax as we know it today didn't even exist so I mean Joel how do you
[01:15:49.880 --> 01:15:54.880]  respond to these status these big government liberals who claim that the
[01:15:54.880 --> 01:16:00.880]  income tax is so sacred that the whole country would collapse in an instant
[01:16:00.880 --> 01:16:06.880]  if it was abolished in America well you know it's interesting the government
[01:16:06.880 --> 01:16:11.880]  of course has grown to absorb whatever tax level that it takes from the people
[01:16:11.880 --> 01:16:16.880]  government could not get along at all anymore on excess of excise taxes
[01:16:16.880 --> 01:16:22.880]  simply because it is a small percentage relative to what the government
[01:16:22.880 --> 01:16:26.880]  spends Ron Paul is absolutely right that the problem is government spending
[01:16:26.880 --> 01:16:32.880]  not the amount that you use tax I personally am not in favor of even though
[01:16:32.880 --> 01:16:37.880]  that was the original constitutional tax excise taxes because frankly that is
[01:16:37.880 --> 01:16:42.880]  a selected tax it isn't directly related to any government service it
[01:16:42.880 --> 01:16:48.880]  simply penalizes those that wish to purchase overseas I really believe
[01:16:48.880 --> 01:16:52.880]  that there are certain principles of taxation that need to be employed in
[01:16:52.880 --> 01:16:56.880]  the United States and one is that if the tax be directly related to the
[01:16:56.880 --> 01:17:01.880]  government service and that you shall not tax ever to transfer money to any
[01:17:01.880 --> 01:17:06.880]  other person for any welfare or benefits or unemployment compensation
[01:17:06.880 --> 01:17:11.880]  none of that could be done by taxes but has to be done by user fees and insurance
[01:17:11.880 --> 01:17:19.880]  so the only real two viable taxes in libertarian thought are property taxes
[01:17:19.880 --> 01:17:24.880]  and I know a lot of people don't like property taxes but in fact government
[01:17:24.880 --> 01:17:29.880]  does protect property so you have to pay for the protection of property
[01:17:29.880 --> 01:17:34.880]  even if it's on a national basis they are protecting property and secondly
[01:17:34.880 --> 01:17:39.880]  people and it doesn't cost the government really anymore to protect a rich
[01:17:39.880 --> 01:17:46.880]  person than a poor person and so head taxes in fact are the very real
[01:17:46.880 --> 01:17:50.880]  and appropriate enforcement taxes but they should be kept small of course
[01:17:50.880 --> 01:17:58.880]  because that is a heavy burden on government mostly it's the land area
[01:17:58.880 --> 01:18:03.880]  of government that needs to be protected and that's why you can have some type
[01:18:03.880 --> 01:18:08.880]  of taxation that is formed based on the productivity and use of the land so
[01:18:08.880 --> 01:18:13.880]  that raw land isn't taxed or agriculture isn't taxed as much as heavy
[01:18:13.880 --> 01:18:18.880]  industrial use of properties but those are some of the principles that I know
[01:18:18.880 --> 01:18:22.880]  Ron and I Ron Paul and I have talked about that would be the ideal way to
[01:18:22.880 --> 01:18:27.880]  get in there be no income tax those people should not be penalized for
[01:18:27.880 --> 01:18:33.880]  being productive for being for working in that regard and of course in order to
[01:18:33.880 --> 01:18:37.880]  make these kinds of taxes work you simply have to cut government back to
[01:18:37.880 --> 01:18:41.880]  the original constitutional principle of only defending fundamental rights
[01:18:41.880 --> 01:18:46.880]  and not forgiving benefits for an aid welfare or fighting for wars for that
[01:18:46.880 --> 01:18:51.880]  matter and not for hiring garbage collectors to hunt for terrorists
[01:18:51.880 --> 01:18:57.880]  which I also saved a little money I also noted in your most recent World Affairs
[01:18:57.880 --> 01:19:03.880]  brief that you've been covering the WikiLeaks story and I've been looking
[01:19:03.880 --> 01:19:07.880]  into this over the past few days and of course we know that WikiLeaks was
[01:19:07.880 --> 01:19:14.880]  founded by Tibetan dissidents and that their original state of goal was to
[01:19:14.880 --> 01:19:21.880]  route out corruption and abuse in these countries in East Asia in the Middle
[01:19:21.880 --> 01:19:26.880]  East that are primarily targets of the US military industrial complex we also
[01:19:26.880 --> 01:19:31.880]  know that in the embryonic stages of WikiLeaks that they sought help from
[01:19:31.880 --> 01:19:37.880]  George Soros's controlled freedom house organization so I want to talk a
[01:19:37.880 --> 01:19:41.880]  little about Julian Assange and what's really going on behind WikiLeaks
[01:19:41.880 --> 01:19:47.880]  behind the story for mass consumption that we're being bombarded with on a
[01:19:47.880 --> 01:19:52.880]  daily basis in the establishment media Joel Scousen World Affairs brief the

[01:24:16.880 --> 01:24:22.880]  now WikiLeaks we had this bizarre dump of thousands of supposedly unfiltered
[01:24:22.880 --> 01:24:29.880]  cables which for the most part merely bolstered the rhetoric behind the war
[01:24:29.880 --> 01:24:34.880]  on terror and the US military industrial complex agenda in the Middle East
[01:24:34.880 --> 01:24:39.880]  and East Asia and in fact what most people don't know is that these cables
[01:24:39.880 --> 01:24:43.880]  and the way they're being shaped into stories and released to the public is
[01:24:43.880 --> 01:24:49.880]  being handled by primarily the New York Times in concert with the US government
[01:24:49.880 --> 01:24:53.880]  that's right the New York Times is going to the US government and saying what do
[01:24:53.880 --> 01:24:57.880]  we need to redact what can we keep in before they release their stories about
[01:24:57.880 --> 01:25:03.880]  these WikiLeaks cables and of course they're all centered around for example
[01:25:03.880 --> 01:25:09.880]  Iran buying missiles from North Korea that can reach Western Europe so these
[01:25:09.880 --> 01:25:15.880]  cables seemingly conflict with WikiLeaks agenda to expose corruption and abuse
[01:25:15.880 --> 01:25:22.880]  and in fact seem to be serving more as a propaganda boost for the war on terror
[01:25:22.880 --> 01:25:27.880]  Joel I've got your quote here from World Affairs Brief where you said
[01:25:27.880 --> 01:25:32.880]  quote the WikiLeaks revelations appear to be purposeful leaks by government
[01:25:32.880 --> 01:25:37.880]  to provide further impetus to shut down future whistleblowers who might uncover
[01:25:37.880 --> 01:25:42.880]  government illegal acts hiding under the cover of national security secrets
[01:25:42.880 --> 01:25:47.880]  and now of course we've got the basically the false flag against the internet
[01:25:47.880 --> 01:25:53.880]  now they're using it to go after that. Joel could you expand on this WikiLeaks situation?
[01:25:53.880 --> 01:25:59.880]  Yes it's very very suspicious you know anytime you have a multi-million dollar
[01:25:59.880 --> 01:26:04.880]  organization come out of nowhere with no real funding that's apparent
[01:26:04.880 --> 01:26:09.880]  you have to wonder you know who's behind this because this just doesn't happen
[01:26:09.880 --> 01:26:14.880]  very very easily it's like we found out that Google had a too good to be true
[01:26:14.880 --> 01:26:20.880]  startup with NSA and CIA funding and now we find that WikiLeaks has some of
[01:26:20.880 --> 01:26:25.880]  these funding as well as well as some big international foundations which
[01:26:25.880 --> 01:26:30.880]  Julian Assange has admitted have funded this but he refuses to name which one
[01:26:30.880 --> 01:26:34.880]  because he says that we'll lose our grants in other words they agreed only to
[01:26:34.880 --> 01:26:41.880]  give if it were to kept in secret the issue of them parsing out these
[01:26:41.880 --> 01:26:47.880]  quarter million dollar quarter million cables to mainstream news items is a
[01:26:47.880 --> 01:26:52.880]  very very important point none other than David E. Sanger
[01:26:52.880 --> 01:26:56.880]  supposedly independent journalist working for the New York Times is in charge
[01:26:56.880 --> 01:27:02.880]  of filtering these cables to the public and this is a guy who's a member of the
[01:27:02.880 --> 01:27:07.880]  Council on Foreign Relations the Aspen Institute Strategy Group you know with
[01:27:07.880 --> 01:27:11.880]  the likes of Madeleine Albright, Condoleezza Rice, William Perry, John
[01:27:11.880 --> 01:27:16.880]  Deutsch, William B. Zollack, Philip Zellikoff you know all of these people
[01:27:16.880 --> 01:27:21.880]  are very very big in the globalist regime they are part of the government
[01:27:21.880 --> 01:27:26.880]  procedure to shield the government from exposure from the illegal acts that
[01:27:26.880 --> 01:27:31.880]  they are doing and one of my major complaints is that these dumps appear
[01:27:31.880 --> 01:27:36.880]  like they have been pre-filtered if you really truly had a dump of a quarter
[01:27:36.880 --> 01:27:43.880]  million cables there would be dozens and dozens of secret admissions and
[01:27:43.880 --> 01:27:47.880]  instructions given to people about interference with government that would
[01:27:47.880 --> 01:27:52.880]  make the present resolutions or revelations look outrageous by comparison
[01:27:52.880 --> 01:27:57.880]  and there's nothing in that and then we're fed the story that this young
[01:27:57.880 --> 01:28:05.880]  private you know was apparently had it was in charge of or at least had
[01:28:05.880 --> 01:28:08.880]  access to all these cables that anybody who's been in government such as
[01:28:08.880 --> 01:28:12.880]  myself knows that that just isn't possible there isn't anyone in that
[01:28:12.880 --> 01:28:16.880]  level of government that has access to these kinds of cables and if it were
[01:28:16.880 --> 01:28:20.880]  a true whistleblower and interestingly Paul there's no evidence that all that
[01:28:20.880 --> 01:28:24.880]  this private is political in any sense whatsoever he doesn't have an agenda
[01:28:24.880 --> 01:28:29.880]  about exposing government wrongdoing but if it were a true whistleblower he
[01:28:29.880 --> 01:28:33.880]  would be ferreting out the most dangerous cables and leaking those to make
[01:28:33.880 --> 01:28:37.880]  sure that those got exposure not dumping supposedly a quarter million
[01:28:37.880 --> 01:28:43.880]  cables at a time and I think in fact the story about the dump merely was
[01:28:43.880 --> 01:28:48.880]  that in order to give the impression that this is unfiltered but in fact it's
[01:28:48.880 --> 01:28:53.880]  clearly filtered anyone who knows what goes on in cables in the diplomatic
[01:28:53.880 --> 01:28:58.880]  regime knows that there's a great deal of filtering that's gone on and I mean
[01:28:58.880 --> 01:29:03.880]  not only is a Sanjad meeting to the fact that he's funded by these unknown
[01:29:03.880 --> 01:29:08.880]  millionaires he's actually making deals with governments reportedly the
[01:29:08.880 --> 01:29:13.880]  government of Israel not to embarrass them by redacting whole cables and
[01:29:13.880 --> 01:29:17.880]  whole documents so he's making deals with some of the most corrupt and
[01:29:17.880 --> 01:29:21.880]  abusive governments on the planet while claiming you know he fronts for an
[01:29:21.880 --> 01:29:26.880]  organization aimed at exposing corruption and abuse very very strange
[01:29:26.880 --> 01:29:32.880]  contradictions arising out this weekly story and we'll go on to discuss it
[01:29:32.880 --> 01:29:38.880]  after the break including Julian Assange's view on 9-11 and why we haven't
[01:29:38.880 --> 01:29:42.880]  seen any weak leaked cables on that we'll be back after the break Alex Jones

[01:33:14.880 --> 01:33:19.880]  you did something to stop Mr. Assange we're looking at that right now the
[01:33:19.880 --> 01:33:25.880]  Justice Department is taking a look at that and I'm not going to comment on
[01:33:25.880 --> 01:33:33.880]  that process you think he is a criminal if he conspires to get these
[01:33:33.880 --> 01:33:38.880]  classified documents with a member of the U.S. military that's fundamentally
[01:33:38.880 --> 01:33:42.880]  different than if somebody drops on your lap here David you're a fresh person
[01:33:42.880 --> 01:33:47.880]  here is classified material Mr. Connell said he's a high-tech terrorist others
[01:33:47.880 --> 01:33:51.880]  say this is akin to the Pentagon papers where you come I would argue that it's
[01:33:51.880 --> 01:33:56.880]  closer to being a high-tech terrorist than the Pentagon papers so that's vice
[01:33:56.880 --> 01:34:02.880]  president Joe Beden saying that Julian Assange of WikiLeaks is a high-tech
[01:34:02.880 --> 01:34:08.880]  terrorist very strange charge to make given the fact that the New York Times
[01:34:08.880 --> 01:34:15.880]  of David E. Sanger New York Times chief Washington correspondent states quote
[01:34:15.880 --> 01:34:20.880]  we went through the cable so carefully to try to redact material that we thought
[01:34:20.880 --> 01:34:25.880]  would be damaging to individuals or undercut ongoing operations and we even
[01:34:25.880 --> 01:34:30.880]  took the very unusual step of showing the 100 cables or so that we were
[01:34:30.880 --> 01:34:35.880]  writing from to the U.S. government and asking them if they had additional
[01:34:35.880 --> 01:34:40.880]  redactions to suggest so the New York Times is working hand in hand with the
[01:34:40.880 --> 01:34:45.880]  U.S. government to release WikiLeaks cables and yet the vice president Beden
[01:34:45.880 --> 01:34:50.880]  is saying that Julian Assange is a high-tech terrorist for releasing WikiLeaks
[01:34:50.880 --> 01:34:58.880]  cables Joel Scousen how do you square those two contradictions well it's
[01:34:58.880 --> 01:35:04.880]  very very clear that the New Shield Act introduced by government shill Joe
[01:35:04.880 --> 01:35:12.880]  Lieberman senator is merely a pretext in order to begin to prosecute people for
[01:35:12.880 --> 01:35:17.880]  revealing government secrets especially the ones that would reveal government
[01:35:17.880 --> 01:35:21.880]  wrongdoing it's very interesting there's a extreme contradiction in law here
[01:35:21.880 --> 01:35:27.880]  because there is a federal statute which actually makes it a crime to not reveal
[01:35:27.880 --> 01:35:32.880]  to anyone especially a judge you must reveal any wrongdoing that you find
[01:35:32.880 --> 01:35:36.880]  within the federal government and you're protected by law in that regard and
[01:35:36.880 --> 01:35:40.880]  now they want to a crime to make it a basically a crime anytime you reveal
[01:35:40.880 --> 01:35:43.880]  anything in secret regardless of the substance that you could be prosecuted
[01:35:43.880 --> 01:35:47.880]  that's what the shield act does it actually starts out by saying its
[01:35:47.880 --> 01:35:52.880]  focus is to make sure that no one reveals any source confidential source
[01:35:52.880 --> 01:35:56.880]  within the government and of course all that's been redacted so nothing in
[01:35:56.880 --> 01:36:01.880]  that qualifies within WikiLeaks but then there's also fine print that says
[01:36:01.880 --> 01:36:05.880]  anything that might be detrimental to the interest of the or the security
[01:36:05.880 --> 01:36:09.880]  interest of the federal government what's interesting about that of course
[01:36:09.880 --> 01:36:12.880]  is that one it's a wide open loophole that anything can be viewed as
[01:36:12.880 --> 01:36:17.880]  detrimental to the security of the United States government but in several
[01:36:17.880 --> 01:36:21.880]  court precedents recently the federal government has ruled and incredibly
[01:36:21.880 --> 01:36:25.880]  judges have gone along with this that basically says that anything that we
[01:36:25.880 --> 01:36:29.880]  the government label as secret or top secret cannot even be reviewed by the
[01:36:29.880 --> 01:36:33.880]  courts meaning that the courts are not allowed to judge whether or not there's
[01:36:33.880 --> 01:36:38.880]  any substance to the claim that these things should not be protected by
[01:36:38.880 --> 01:36:44.880]  national security state secrets acts but in fact just by merely being ruled
[01:36:44.880 --> 01:36:48.880]  secret that government and courts are not allowed to review those this is a very
[01:36:48.880 --> 01:36:52.880]  real catch-22 situation that we're heading for and I think it's very very
[01:36:52.880 --> 01:36:55.880]  dangerous Paul.
[01:36:55.880 --> 01:37:00.880]  In World Affairs Brief you include the harrowing quote from Naomi Klein
[01:37:00.880 --> 01:37:05.880]  where she points out that the last time we saw criticism of the state
[01:37:05.880 --> 01:37:10.880]  labeled as treason was of course in Nazi Germany so I was interested to read
[01:37:10.880 --> 01:37:16.880]  that but I mean the thing that gets me about WikiLeaks is we've seen nothing
[01:37:16.880 --> 01:37:21.880]  about Israel's war on Lebanon from that period of time from May to September
[01:37:21.880 --> 01:37:27.880]  2006 as a complete gap in the cables we've got talk of him making deals with
[01:37:27.880 --> 01:37:31.880]  the Israeli government we've got Netanyahu coming out and saying that a deal
[01:37:31.880 --> 01:37:36.880]  was made to prevent Israel being embarrassed basically and then again
[01:37:36.880 --> 01:37:41.880]  9-11 complete absence of any information whatsoever this is the kind of stuff
[01:37:41.880 --> 01:37:45.880]  that would really harm the US military industrial complex and we've seen
[01:37:45.880 --> 01:37:50.880]  neither hide nor hair of it I mean you had Sybel Edmonds the FBI translator
[01:37:50.880 --> 01:37:56.880]  immediately prior to 9-11 getting a deluge of communications concerning
[01:37:56.880 --> 01:38:02.880]  an imminent attack and yet WikiLeaks in these quarter of a million cables
[01:38:02.880 --> 01:38:07.880]  has released nothing whatsoever on 9-11 you know nothing on the five
[01:38:07.880 --> 01:38:11.880]  dancing Israelis nothing on the secret bin Laden flights out of the country
[01:38:11.880 --> 01:38:17.880]  on September 12th when all their traffic was grounded and nothing about the
[01:38:17.880 --> 01:38:22.880]  Israelis Mossad agents that were arrested on the George Washington bridge
[01:38:22.880 --> 01:38:27.880]  with 2,000 pounds of explosives so anything that could be viewed as damaging
[01:38:27.880 --> 01:38:33.880]  to the US military industrial complex is nowhere to be seen I mean does that
[01:38:33.880 --> 01:38:37.880]  indicate that well we know that the New York Times is working with the government
[01:38:37.880 --> 01:38:42.880]  to decide what gets released and I suppose Joel that's really the smoking gun
[01:38:42.880 --> 01:38:47.880]  that these cables released by WikiLeaks are just basically a regurgitation
[01:38:47.880 --> 01:38:51.880]  of neocon propaganda for the most part isn't that the case
[01:38:51.880 --> 01:38:59.880]  it is true and I don't do I mean the military industrial complex is part of
[01:38:59.880 --> 01:39:02.880]  the problem to be sure but these people are lackeys for a larger globalist
[01:39:02.880 --> 01:39:06.880]  conspiracy trying to take down national sovereignty create war and conflict
[01:39:06.880 --> 01:39:12.880]  and you see it really isn't just greedy capitalism this isn't just for money
[01:39:12.880 --> 01:39:17.880]  there is a I mean these people are already the most wealthy people in the
[01:39:17.880 --> 01:39:22.880]  in the world what more how much more money to need that's not really the issue
[01:39:22.880 --> 01:39:27.880]  the issue is they have to reward people to entice them from the military
[01:39:27.880 --> 01:39:31.880]  industrial complex into this globalist conspiracy of power but it's much bigger
[01:39:31.880 --> 01:39:36.880]  than just greed it is about power international power and the scope
[01:39:36.880 --> 01:39:40.880]  and you're absolutely right about the filtering I am convinced that the
[01:39:40.880 --> 01:39:44.880]  filtering actually took place before these cables or a good portion of the
[01:39:44.880 --> 01:39:48.880]  filtering took place before the cables were released because there are things
[01:39:48.880 --> 01:39:53.880]  for example about the Lebanon war that they would never have allowed there
[01:39:53.880 --> 01:39:57.880]  had to be for example communication with the United States telling Israel
[01:39:57.880 --> 01:40:01.880]  for the first time to go after civilian targets because that was the major change
[01:40:01.880 --> 01:40:05.880]  they wholesale went after bombing and strafing of civilian infrastructure
[01:40:05.880 --> 01:40:10.880]  targets in Lebanon and generally the Israelis have except for Gaza you know
[01:40:10.880 --> 01:40:14.880]  had not done that in their wars and so there you know that would have been
[01:40:14.880 --> 01:40:20.880]  very very telling for the US to be in giving those kinds of instructions
[01:40:20.880 --> 01:40:25.880]  and of course 9-11 there had to be a tremendous amount of cables relative to
[01:40:25.880 --> 01:40:30.880]  the air training for the terrorist pilots that went on in Saudi Arabia
[01:40:30.880 --> 01:40:33.880]  there would have been discussions about that there are many embarrassing things
[01:40:33.880 --> 01:40:38.880]  about Saudi Arabian funding of terrorism that would have been caught up in those cables
[01:40:38.880 --> 01:40:43.880]  none of that as you said has come forward and that's why this is in fact a
[01:40:43.880 --> 01:40:49.880]  rigged game specifically to give justification for this type of legislation
[01:40:49.880 --> 01:40:52.880]  by Lieberman the shield act to get passed
[01:40:52.880 --> 01:40:57.880]  now I also wanted to say before just to cut in here before we lose time on this
[01:40:57.880 --> 01:41:00.880]  I wanted to make a point about your first story you were talking about
[01:41:00.880 --> 01:41:03.880]  with the libertarians who were taking signatures
[01:41:03.880 --> 01:41:09.880]  it's very important to understand that almost never do any judges uphold a citizen
[01:41:09.880 --> 01:41:15.880]  against the witness of a policeman when they file the reports and they always
[01:41:15.880 --> 01:41:21.880]  falsify the evidence in order to justify their reason for taking them into custody
[01:41:21.880 --> 01:41:25.880]  they always claim resisting arrest they claim that they were attacked by the
[01:41:25.880 --> 01:41:30.880]  civilian that they arrest so one never wants to get into a situation with government
[01:41:30.880 --> 01:41:35.880]  without pre-preparing to take the evidence I think there was a major mistake
[01:41:35.880 --> 01:41:40.880]  by telling him I need to take out my cell phone and record your telling me to leave
[01:41:40.880 --> 01:41:47.880]  he should have already had that out there turned on and I often will use a tape record
[01:41:47.880 --> 01:41:52.880]  I can just put in my my coat pocket so at least I get the verbal one if they take
[01:41:52.880 --> 01:41:57.880]  my cell phone away but you should always have witnesses there present who are doing
[01:41:57.880 --> 01:42:02.880]  the recording so that you can take it from a disinterested third party
[01:42:02.880 --> 01:42:07.880]  but we need to be very careful to document what happens in the increasing
[01:42:07.880 --> 01:42:10.880]  tyrannical state of police
[01:42:10.880 --> 01:42:18.880]  Joel Scousen World Affairs Brief.com Linda in Texas you're on the air go ahead with your question for Joel Scousen
[01:42:18.880 --> 01:42:28.880]  Yes I just found out that this past Saturday night the Senate passed unanimously this Food Safety Modernization Act
[01:42:28.880 --> 01:42:36.880]  which hurts the organic farmers and food producers and small family farms
[01:42:36.880 --> 01:42:41.880]  basically I guess helping out corporate big agribusiness
[01:42:41.880 --> 01:42:48.880]  and for two years we in Austin that fluoride free Austin have been fighting big aggro
[01:42:48.880 --> 01:42:55.880]  by the fact that we 60% of our cities pay to add fluoride waste to our water
[01:42:55.880 --> 01:43:01.880]  and this Senate food safety bill passes is going to just help them out all the more
[01:43:01.880 --> 01:43:06.880]  and we also have the issue of toxic bio sludge which our cities are making
[01:43:06.880 --> 01:43:12.880]  and then giving out free to people in the community are selling it for dirt cheap
[01:43:12.880 --> 01:43:18.880]  and I was wondering if you've addressed these issues Joel regarding our water, food safety,
[01:43:18.880 --> 01:43:23.880]  codex elementarius it's all driving me crazy
[01:43:23.880 --> 01:43:30.880]  She brings up very very good points I am covering this even in this week's World Affairs Brief
[01:43:30.880 --> 01:43:36.880]  about the Senate by unanimous consent in fact passing, doing a revision basically
[01:43:36.880 --> 01:43:40.880]  of their flawed Food Safety Bill Act that they passed
[01:43:40.880 --> 01:43:46.880]  they actually had taxing provisions which made it an unconstitutional piece of legislation
[01:43:46.880 --> 01:43:50.880]  that the House could not take up it was red flagged for that
[01:43:50.880 --> 01:43:55.880]  and what they did do and I'm very ashamed that this got unanimous consent in the Senate
[01:43:55.880 --> 01:44:01.880]  basically remedying that by stripping out the tax provisions
[01:44:01.880 --> 01:44:07.880]  now I think the reason why they justified a unanimous consent provision was that
[01:44:07.880 --> 01:44:13.880]  it was enacting or remedying something that had already been passed before
[01:44:13.880 --> 01:44:19.880]  normally these things are passed by unanimous consent if there is a technical flaw within them
[01:44:19.880 --> 01:44:21.880]  and I think that's how they got it passed
[01:44:21.880 --> 01:44:26.880]  unfortunately what a lot of people don't know is that the final revision doesn't have the tester amendment
[01:44:26.880 --> 01:44:32.880]  which exempts the small producers which was the main reason why it got passed in the first place
[01:44:32.880 --> 01:44:38.880]  and so we've got a very real danger of having small producers being impinged on with the tremendous paperwork
[01:44:38.880 --> 01:44:41.880]  and the restrictions that are involved in this
[01:44:41.880 --> 01:44:46.880]  I have also in the past covered the codex problems emanating from Europe
[01:44:46.880 --> 01:44:48.880]  and how we're slowly implementing that
[01:44:48.880 --> 01:44:52.880]  the fluoride I'm very much against these are very toxic poisons
[01:44:52.880 --> 01:44:58.880]  the chemical sludge that she mentioned coming from waste processing facilities
[01:44:58.880 --> 01:45:01.880]  and sold Dennis fertilizer things they're full of heavy metals
[01:45:01.880 --> 01:45:07.880]  chemicals that should not be used in any way to grow garden vegetables
[01:45:07.880 --> 01:45:10.880]  so the caller is very very knowledgeable
[01:45:10.880 --> 01:45:16.880]  we try to support those types of exposés in the world of Paris brief
[01:45:16.880 --> 01:45:21.880]  OK thanks Linda I mean it's a joke that they call it a food safety act
[01:45:21.880 --> 01:45:27.880]  given that concurrently Americans are literally drinking liquid cancer
[01:45:27.880 --> 01:45:30.880]  I mean have you seen this article out the Washington Post
[01:45:30.880 --> 01:45:34.880]  US water has large amounts of likely carcinogen
[01:45:34.880 --> 01:45:40.880]  a US environmental group has found that drinking water in 35 American cities contains
[01:45:40.880 --> 01:45:46.880]  hexavalent chromium a probable carcinogen the Washington Post reported Sunday
[01:45:46.880 --> 01:45:51.880]  and it's a strange coincidence that this problem centered in California
[01:45:51.880 --> 01:45:57.880]  given the fact that as Rosalind Peterson documents for California Skywatch
[01:45:57.880 --> 01:46:06.880]  when they analyzed the water samples and found things like arsenic, barium, aluminum, calcium, manganese, lead and iron
[01:46:06.880 --> 01:46:12.880]  the discovery of these compounds in the water samples matched precisely
[01:46:12.880 --> 01:46:18.880]  with the discovery of the same compounds in airborne samples that were taken at the same time
[01:46:18.880 --> 01:46:22.880]  so they know for a fact that all this stuff is coming from the air
[01:46:22.880 --> 01:46:26.880]  and what do we see whenever we look up we see chemtrails
[01:46:26.880 --> 01:46:32.880]  and this is they've measured they've documented that this stuff is finding its way into our drinking water
[01:46:32.880 --> 01:46:38.880]  but meanwhile we're being bombarded with the lie the myth that the real environmental problem is
[01:46:38.880 --> 01:46:43.880]  man-made double warming when Americans are literally drinking liquid cancer
[01:46:43.880 --> 01:46:48.880]  Ed in Connecticut you're on the air your question for Joel Scousen
[01:46:48.880 --> 01:46:54.880]  Yeah I was a lot of people you know they might not have the money to invest in
[01:46:54.880 --> 01:46:58.880]  platinum and platinum and gold and silver or even silver
[01:46:58.880 --> 01:47:02.880]  I'm wondering how you guys and people it would be practical to invest in
[01:47:02.880 --> 01:47:09.880]  West precious metals such as copper, brass, aluminum
[01:47:09.880 --> 01:47:16.880]  My response is no and the reason is because the quantities for investment quantities have to be so large
[01:47:16.880 --> 01:47:23.880]  you're talking about tons and it's only there is no market except to the major industries
[01:47:23.880 --> 01:47:29.880]  to get your money back out of those things whereas there's a much more distributed market
[01:47:29.880 --> 01:47:33.880]  in gold and silver so I think silver is probably the best
[01:47:33.880 --> 01:47:38.880]  hard money investment right now and I would because it still is
[01:47:38.880 --> 01:47:42.880]  fairly recently priced there is probably going to be a correction in gold and silver
[01:47:42.880 --> 01:47:47.880]  but in the long term it's got to go up double and even triple over in the long term
[01:47:47.880 --> 01:47:50.880]  so I think it will be a good investment still
[01:47:50.880 --> 01:47:55.880]  I mean you can get a one ounce silver coin for what's the price now
[01:47:55.880 --> 01:48:00.880]  $30 is it so I mean it still makes a good investment compared to gold
[01:48:00.880 --> 01:48:04.880]  which as you said most people can't afford now that it's gone through the roof
[01:48:04.880 --> 01:48:09.880]  and all paper currencies are depreciating against it so it costs you more of those
[01:48:09.880 --> 01:48:12.880]  phony fiat currencies to buy precious metals
[01:48:12.880 --> 01:48:17.880]  Brian in Ohio your question for Joel Scousen go ahead
[01:48:17.880 --> 01:48:22.880]  Hi Mr. Scousen I was just wondering how do you see the future of the dollar
[01:48:22.880 --> 01:48:28.880]  the world reserve currency with Russia and China deciding that it's trading US dollars anymore
[01:48:28.880 --> 01:48:33.880]  Actually that's something that is not a major threat
[01:48:33.880 --> 01:48:38.880]  the amount of their trade between each other in dollars is very very small anyway
[01:48:38.880 --> 01:48:44.880]  in fact they made a similar announcement several years ago I think it was in 2007
[01:48:44.880 --> 01:48:47.880]  that they were going to stop trading in dollars and they in fact didn't do it
[01:48:47.880 --> 01:48:51.880]  so it really isn't a major threat
[01:48:51.880 --> 01:48:56.880]  we've got to remember that you cannot simply dump the dollar
[01:48:56.880 --> 01:49:00.880]  and not have catastrophic consequences for anybody who deals in dollars
[01:49:00.880 --> 01:49:05.880]  anyone who has a dollar reserve like China if they would start to dump dollars in a major way
[01:49:05.880 --> 01:49:08.880]  would reduce the value of everything they have left
[01:49:08.880 --> 01:49:13.880]  so in essence the world is held hostage by the fact that they've already accepted dollars
[01:49:13.880 --> 01:49:15.880]  for things of real value
[01:49:15.880 --> 01:49:19.880]  and so they have a vested interest in keeping the dollar fairly strong
[01:49:19.880 --> 01:49:24.880]  and that's why despite its weakness it still is holding its own even against the euro
[01:49:24.880 --> 01:49:27.880]  which will probably collapse even before the dollar
[01:49:27.880 --> 01:49:30.880]  because there's so few out there compared to the dollar
[01:49:30.880 --> 01:49:34.880]  there's over 200 trillion dollars that have been monetized out there
[01:49:34.880 --> 01:49:39.880]  so that the rate of inflation even at 3 trillion a year by the Federal Reserve
[01:49:39.880 --> 01:49:42.880]  is only one and a half percent of the existing money supply
[01:49:42.880 --> 01:49:45.880]  is going to take a lot to get the hyperinflation
[01:49:45.880 --> 01:49:47.880]  the powers to be know that
[01:49:47.880 --> 01:49:50.880]  and so I think they're going to continue to play the dollar
[01:49:50.880 --> 01:49:53.880]  and play the inflation game
[01:49:53.880 --> 01:49:56.880]  so I'm predicting a long downhill run on the dollar
[01:49:56.880 --> 01:50:00.880]  steady downhill rather than an imminent collapse
[01:50:00.880 --> 01:50:03.880]  Jeff in Delaware, quick question before the break, go ahead
[01:50:03.880 --> 01:50:05.880]  yeah, how you doing guys today?
[01:50:05.880 --> 01:50:07.880]  just to be real quick, yes
[01:50:07.880 --> 01:50:10.880]  I read something like two days, three days ago
[01:50:10.880 --> 01:50:14.880]  the CIA, WikiLeaks passed the documents to the CIA
[01:50:14.880 --> 01:50:17.880]  the CIA scared it and sent it back to WikiLeaks
[01:50:17.880 --> 01:50:20.880]  so now I think I read that in The Guardian
[01:50:20.880 --> 01:50:24.880]  real quick, okay people
[01:50:24.880 --> 01:50:27.880]  we're going to have to stand up worldwide, okay
[01:50:27.880 --> 01:50:30.880]  look, it's much deeper than money, gold
[01:50:30.880 --> 01:50:33.880]  and something spiritual like Alex said a couple of days ago
[01:50:33.880 --> 01:50:38.880]  the American people, the people worldwide, we got to get back to ourselves
[01:50:38.880 --> 01:50:41.880]  and...
[01:50:41.880 --> 01:50:43.880]  okay we lost Jeff
[01:50:43.880 --> 01:50:46.880]  we'll get to WikiLeaks after the break with Joel Scousen

[01:54:31.880 --> 01:54:36.880]  funny that he should say that when Julian Assange
[01:54:36.880 --> 01:54:40.880]  is allowing the US government to decide what information comes out
[01:54:40.880 --> 01:54:43.880]  from these WikiLeaks cables
[01:54:43.880 --> 01:54:46.880]  is it really in their interest to release information
[01:54:46.880 --> 01:54:50.880]  of real conspiracies which would implicate themselves?
[01:54:50.880 --> 01:54:51.880]  I don't think so
[01:54:51.880 --> 01:54:55.880]  this is the New York Times, the Economist
[01:54:55.880 --> 01:54:58.880]  they're deciding what they want to get out the WikiLeaks cables
[01:54:58.880 --> 01:55:02.880]  and then they're working with the CIA, with the US government
[01:55:02.880 --> 01:55:04.880]  to redact what is necessary
[01:55:04.880 --> 01:55:09.880]  and while Joe Biedin, the Vice President calls Assange a high-tech terrorist
[01:55:09.880 --> 01:55:13.880]  his own government is working with the establishment media
[01:55:13.880 --> 01:55:15.880]  to release these cables

[01:56:11.880 --> 01:56:13.880]  Good afternoon gentlemen
[01:56:13.880 --> 01:56:14.880]  How are you?
[01:56:14.880 --> 01:56:16.880]  Afternoon Scott, what's your question today?
[01:56:16.880 --> 01:56:20.880]  I'm going to shift gears here a little bit but stay along the lines of Big Brother
[01:56:20.880 --> 01:56:24.880]  and I'm asked Mr. Scousen if he's ever seen
[01:56:24.880 --> 01:56:28.880]  or knows of the American Community Survey
[01:56:28.880 --> 01:56:30.880]  I do, I have seen it
[01:56:30.880 --> 01:56:35.880]  Have you received it and have you had to fill it out too, sir?
[01:56:35.880 --> 01:56:39.880]  Well, I have refused to fill it out
[01:56:39.880 --> 01:56:42.880]  I don't believe that it is constitutionally authorized
[01:56:42.880 --> 01:56:45.880]  for the Census Department to ask the kinds of intrusive questions
[01:56:45.880 --> 01:56:48.880]  that they do on the American Community Survey
[01:56:48.880 --> 01:56:52.880]  and I encourage everyone else to refuse to fill it out
[01:56:52.880 --> 01:56:56.880]  Now they will say that there's all kinds of penalties
[01:56:56.880 --> 01:56:59.880]  but they are extremely reluctant ever to prosecute it
[01:56:59.880 --> 01:57:03.880]  because if you got into court it would be very difficult for them, if not impossible
[01:57:03.880 --> 01:57:05.880]  to justify doing so
[01:57:05.880 --> 01:57:06.880]  So they will rant and rave
[01:57:06.880 --> 01:57:11.880]  but you can be pretty well assured that nothing will happen if you refuse to fill it out
[01:57:11.880 --> 01:57:17.880]  Okay, thanks Scott, I mean these censuses are getting more and more invasive
[01:57:17.880 --> 01:57:22.880]  It's a legal requirement to say how many people live in your house, that's it
[01:57:22.880 --> 01:57:27.880]  In Britain now, even 10 years ago we were about to have another census next year
[01:57:27.880 --> 01:57:31.880]  They were asking people what time they left work, what were their interests
[01:57:31.880 --> 01:57:33.880]  deep personal questions
[01:57:33.880 --> 01:57:35.880]  and it's none of their business
[01:57:35.880 --> 01:57:39.880]  Mark in Florida, final caller for Joel Scousen, go ahead Mark
[01:57:39.880 --> 01:57:45.880]  Joel, I just wondered, do you know of any service provided by a government employee
[01:57:45.880 --> 01:57:51.880]  that is not delivered under threats of violence and at the barrel of a gun?
[01:57:55.880 --> 01:57:58.880]  Well that's it, there are services, there are not requirements
[01:57:58.880 --> 01:58:00.880]  that are not backed up by the threat of a gun
[01:58:00.880 --> 01:58:03.880]  but there are services that are yielded that
[01:58:03.880 --> 01:58:06.880]  I mean for example you're not required to receive
[01:58:06.880 --> 01:58:10.880]  or do you take your social security check if you're not required to take a welfare payment
[01:58:10.880 --> 01:58:14.880]  but anything that does have a requirement to it is backed up by the barrel of a gun
[01:58:14.880 --> 01:58:18.880]  Okay, that's all we've got time for, thanks Mark
[01:58:18.880 --> 01:58:22.880]  Joel Scousen, great for you to be on the show today, we'll talk to you later
[01:58:22.880 --> 01:58:26.880]  and people can check out Joel's great work at worldaffairsbrief.com
[01:58:26.880 --> 01:58:29.880]  Gerald Salente coming up in the rebroadcast third hour
[01:58:29.880 --> 01:58:32.880]  I'll be back tomorrow for the Tuesday edition
[01:58:32.880 --> 01:58:36.880]  This is the Alex Jones Show, PrisonPlanet.tv
[01:59:03.880 --> 01:59:06.880]  And even how you take care of your health and your own family
[01:59:06.880 --> 01:59:09.880]  Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years
[01:59:09.880 --> 01:59:11.880]  The crazy part is, he's usually right
[01:59:11.880 --> 01:59:15.880]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Panny May, Freddie Mac
[01:59:15.880 --> 01:59:18.880]  and America's biggest mall owner, general growth properties
[01:59:18.880 --> 01:59:21.880]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy
[01:59:21.880 --> 01:59:24.880]  Recently, he created a video which you can watch online for free
[01:59:24.880 --> 01:59:27.880]  detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet
[01:59:27.880 --> 01:59:28.880]  and it's a real eye-opener
[01:59:28.880 --> 01:59:30.880]  I can't stress this enough
[01:59:30.880 --> 01:59:32.880]  But at least watch this free video online today
[01:59:32.880 --> 01:59:34.880]  He explains everything you need to know
[01:59:34.880 --> 01:59:36.880]  including simple steps you can take to protect yourself
[01:59:36.880 --> 01:59:41.880]  You can find the video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com
[01:59:41.880 --> 01:59:43.880]  That's End of America, the number 3.com
[01:59:43.880 --> 01:59:47.880]  Watch the free video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com
[01:59:47.880 --> 02:00:01.880]  That's End of America 3.com
[02:00:17.880 --> 02:00:21.880]  Live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones
[02:00:29.880 --> 02:00:32.880]  Well, he predicted in the last year
[02:00:32.880 --> 02:00:35.880]  that we would see the acceleration of the death of the dollar
[02:00:35.880 --> 02:00:37.880]  as the World Reserve currency
[02:00:37.880 --> 02:00:38.880]  in the month of December
[02:00:38.880 --> 02:00:41.880]  and that's certainly happening when gold and silver exploding
[02:00:41.880 --> 02:00:44.880]  unemployment well above 23%
[02:00:44.880 --> 02:00:47.880]  But there's the real world that Gerald Salente covers
[02:00:47.880 --> 02:00:49.880]  then there's the delusional world telling us
[02:00:49.880 --> 02:00:53.880]  that in June of last year the recession ended
[02:00:53.880 --> 02:00:56.880]  But every real economic indicator is we're in deep trouble
[02:00:56.880 --> 02:00:59.880]  and they announced in the Wall Street Journal
[02:00:59.880 --> 02:01:01.880]  two days ago record profits
[02:01:01.880 --> 02:01:05.880]  even above the profits in 2008, the profits in 2009
[02:01:05.880 --> 02:01:10.880]  and going into this year are even bigger for Wall Street
[02:01:10.880 --> 02:01:13.880]  And so we're going to talk to Gerald Salente about WikiLeaks
[02:01:13.880 --> 02:01:17.880]  about the economy, about what he sees in 2011
[02:01:17.880 --> 02:01:20.880]  It's probably our last interview with him this year
[02:01:20.880 --> 02:01:23.880]  and he's with us for the rest of the hour
[02:01:23.880 --> 02:01:26.880]  founder of the Trends Research Institute, TrendsResearch.com
[02:01:26.880 --> 02:01:28.880]  He really needs no introduction
[02:01:28.880 --> 02:01:30.880]  Gerald, I didn't talk to you ahead of the show
[02:01:30.880 --> 02:01:33.880]  I've thrown out some of the issues I want to cover
[02:01:33.880 --> 02:01:36.880]  but this is a short segment as you know
[02:01:36.880 --> 02:01:37.880]  long segment coming up
[02:01:37.880 --> 02:01:40.880]  What are some of the biggest trends you're looking at right now
[02:01:40.880 --> 02:01:43.880]  What bombshells do you have for us we're going to cover in this hour
[02:01:43.880 --> 02:01:46.880]  Look what happened in the UK on Friday
[02:01:46.880 --> 02:01:49.880]  and go back to the Autumn Trends Journal
[02:01:49.880 --> 02:01:52.880]  The headline of the Trends Journal was
[02:01:52.880 --> 02:01:54.880]  off with their heads 2.0
[02:01:54.880 --> 02:01:57.880]  What were they screaming at the royal couple
[02:01:57.880 --> 02:01:59.880]  in their Rolls Royce?
[02:01:59.880 --> 02:02:01.880]  Off with their heads
[02:02:01.880 --> 02:02:04.880]  The people have had it, they're fed up, they know the deal
[02:02:04.880 --> 02:02:06.880]  In fact you always say that
[02:02:06.880 --> 02:02:09.880]  you said it's going to be off with their heads
[02:02:09.880 --> 02:02:11.880]  Yeah, as a matter of fact I tell people
[02:02:11.880 --> 02:02:14.880]  if you want to know a good entrepreneurial business
[02:02:14.880 --> 02:02:17.880]  to consider, guillotines might be it
[02:02:17.880 --> 02:02:20.880]  because this is going worldwide
[02:02:20.880 --> 02:02:23.880]  The people know the deal Alex, here's the deal
[02:02:23.880 --> 02:02:25.880]  It's called austerity measures
[02:02:25.880 --> 02:02:27.880]  When austerity measures equal
[02:02:27.880 --> 02:02:29.880]  you lose your job
[02:02:29.880 --> 02:02:32.880]  if you have one you get paid less
[02:02:32.880 --> 02:02:34.880]  you get your benefits cut
[02:02:34.880 --> 02:02:35.880]  oh and by the way
[02:02:35.880 --> 02:02:37.880]  we're going to raise your taxes
[02:02:37.880 --> 02:02:39.880]  and you know why?
[02:02:39.880 --> 02:02:42.880]  Because the white shoe boys can't get a haircut
[02:02:42.880 --> 02:02:44.880]  that's their language for taking losses
[02:02:44.880 --> 02:02:47.880]  on multi-billion dollar bed bets
[02:02:47.880 --> 02:02:49.880]  that they've made
[02:02:49.880 --> 02:02:52.880]  So the people are angry and what happened in the UK
[02:02:52.880 --> 02:02:55.880]  with the increase in tuition going up
[02:02:55.880 --> 02:02:58.880]  check it out, 200%
[02:02:58.880 --> 02:03:00.880]  you think they're angry and by the way
[02:03:00.880 --> 02:03:03.880]  they also know that in education
[02:03:03.880 --> 02:03:06.880]  there's a degree in worthlessness these days
[02:03:06.880 --> 02:03:09.880]  because it doesn't mean you're going to get a job
[02:03:09.880 --> 02:03:12.880]  So if people want to look at something really hot going on
[02:03:12.880 --> 02:03:15.880]  stay with that story and stay with this
[02:03:15.880 --> 02:03:18.880]  they took it out of the British news like that
[02:03:18.880 --> 02:03:21.880]  that it was wiped out of the news
[02:03:21.880 --> 02:03:23.880]  of the off with their heads news
[02:03:23.880 --> 02:03:25.880]  the day it happened
[02:03:25.880 --> 02:03:28.880]  So this is something really to focus in on
[02:03:28.880 --> 02:03:32.880]  Absolutely, spontaneous rage and anger
[02:03:32.880 --> 02:03:34.880]  When we come back
[02:03:34.880 --> 02:03:36.880]  let's talk about Ireland
[02:03:36.880 --> 02:03:39.880]  it's admitted that the people don't owe the money
[02:03:39.880 --> 02:03:42.880]  it's the offshore banks that owe the money
[02:03:42.880 --> 02:03:44.880]  and as soon as they entered the EU
[02:03:44.880 --> 02:03:47.880]  which is an admitted receivership takeover system
[02:03:47.880 --> 02:03:50.880]  as soon as they were under that contractually
[02:03:50.880 --> 02:03:52.880]  then they tell them oh your economy's over
[02:03:52.880 --> 02:03:55.880]  we've got to raise your taxes, cut all your benefits
[02:03:55.880 --> 02:03:58.880]  and the head of their private central bank
[02:03:58.880 --> 02:04:01.880]  even told the BBC that it's good
[02:04:01.880 --> 02:04:04.880]  that foreigners own your country
[02:04:04.880 --> 02:04:06.880]  I mean these are just such brazen
[02:04:06.880 --> 02:04:09.880]  and I've got another Republican congressperson
[02:04:09.880 --> 02:04:11.880]  today in the news saying
[02:04:11.880 --> 02:04:14.880]  Congress exists to serve the banks
[02:04:14.880 --> 02:04:17.880]  it's like insane hubris
[02:04:17.880 --> 02:04:19.880]  Yeah and that's what it's come to
[02:04:19.880 --> 02:04:21.880]  and this is the aggravation and anger
[02:04:21.880 --> 02:04:23.880]  while people are losing their homes
[02:04:23.880 --> 02:04:25.880]  they have lousy jobs
[02:04:25.880 --> 02:04:27.880]  I'm going to tell you what the deal is, it's this
[02:04:27.880 --> 02:04:29.880]  get up in the morning go to work
[02:04:29.880 --> 02:04:31.880]  get somebody to take care of them
[02:04:31.880 --> 02:04:33.880]  and take that lousy commute that you hate
[02:04:33.880 --> 02:04:36.880]  and when you get to work I don't want to hear any belly aching
[02:04:36.880 --> 02:04:38.880]  do your job, even though you hate it
[02:04:38.880 --> 02:04:40.880]  and you have a job because you need the money
[02:04:40.880 --> 02:04:42.880]  and you need the benefits
[02:04:42.880 --> 02:04:44.880]  and stay late
[02:04:44.880 --> 02:04:46.880]  and then I'll tell you what to do with your money
[02:04:46.880 --> 02:05:00.880]  That's what's going on
[02:05:16.880 --> 02:05:20.880]  it's easy go to homegain150.com

[02:06:52.880 --> 02:07:00.880]  h-O-M-E-G-A-I-N
[02:07:00.880 --> 02:07:02.880]  hondreds of nations have fallen to tyranny
[02:07:02.880 --> 02:07:04.880]  in the last century alone
[02:07:04.880 --> 02:07:07.880]  this is our last chance to not relive history
[02:07:07.880 --> 02:07:09.880]  as we're finishing off this agenda
[02:07:09.880 --> 02:07:12.880]  we'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home
[02:07:12.880 --> 02:07:16.880]  I've turned the members influence on our president in Congress
[02:07:16.880 --> 02:07:18.880]  and they really are calling the shots
[02:07:18.880 --> 02:07:24.180]  the shots. I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay
[02:07:24.180 --> 02:07:28.720]  attention. For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal
[02:07:28.720 --> 02:07:33.400]  offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes
[02:07:33.400 --> 02:07:37.440]  constructing world government. Tim Geithner, Bernanke, and arsonists they're
[02:07:37.440 --> 02:07:41.120]  asking for more matches and the Congress is saying who do we make the checkout to?
[02:07:41.120 --> 02:07:46.200]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen
[02:07:46.200 --> 02:07:53.280]  a fall of the Republic. Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at infowars.com
[02:07:53.280 --> 02:08:00.200]  we're watching online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv
[02:08:00.200 --> 02:08:05.680]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones show
[02:08:05.680 --> 02:08:10.280]  because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:08:10.280 --> 02:08:16.760]  Another issue we're going to be tracking with Gerald Salente is the increased
[02:08:16.760 --> 02:08:21.160]  crime we're seeing and the government's been caught trying to spin those numbers
[02:08:21.160 --> 02:08:25.480]  as well. We're seeing big calls for internet censorship. Google was in the
[02:08:25.480 --> 02:08:28.600]  Wall Street Journal two days ago. They had a big report where they're being
[02:08:28.600 --> 02:08:33.560]  caught not just censoring alternative news but also their competition. Google
[02:08:33.560 --> 02:08:39.140]  is really needs to be replaced like Myspace or other things that become
[02:08:39.140 --> 02:08:44.960]  draconian. It's time to leave Google. It's time to start the exodus away from
[02:08:44.960 --> 02:08:51.880]  that big brother institution. We've got Gerald Salente joining us. He has been
[02:08:51.880 --> 02:08:58.800]  saying for at least two years on my show it's gonna be off with their heads and I
[02:08:58.800 --> 02:09:02.040]  remembering but it's got to be six months ago. Infective listeners can pull it up.
[02:09:02.040 --> 02:09:08.360]  I've seen him on national TV too the same thing. Going into December, going I mean
[02:09:08.360 --> 02:09:12.320]  I hate to imitate you but I mean you can imitate me it's just I'm trying to give
[02:09:12.320 --> 02:09:15.840]  the exact you know flavor of what you said. It's going to be off with their
[02:09:15.840 --> 02:09:22.040]  heads. Going into December, going into 2011, it's going to be revolution by
[02:09:22.040 --> 02:09:26.760]  2012. I mean you've said that over and over again and now it's off with their
[02:09:26.760 --> 02:09:35.720]  heads. Spontaneous riot attacking the Duchess of Twintliness and the Prince
[02:09:35.720 --> 02:09:41.280]  of Corruption. Yeah we're gonna keep seeing it. I'll give you another one
[02:09:41.280 --> 02:09:46.760]  Alex. Two weeks ago, not this past Sunday but the Sunday before, the New
[02:09:46.760 --> 02:09:53.320]  York Times, the toilet paper of record, wrote a feature story in the magazine
[02:09:53.320 --> 02:10:02.440]  section on America's least hated banker, Jamie Dimon, the CEO of JPMorgan Chase.
[02:10:02.440 --> 02:10:08.040]  The guy as you're reading this story, this puff piece, all the way into it he
[02:10:08.040 --> 02:10:13.600]  said oh by the way my mommy and daddy are my mommy's good friends with the
[02:10:13.600 --> 02:10:19.880]  Diamond family. Just a little note yes so then you read this puff piece and then
[02:10:19.880 --> 02:10:25.680]  go to the New York Times website. Read the story and then look at the comments.
[02:10:25.680 --> 02:10:31.800]  One scathing comment after another. What a suck up and brown nose of this guy
[02:10:31.800 --> 02:10:37.800]  Lowenstein who wrote the story is. What a disgusting character Jamie Dimon is. It
[02:10:37.800 --> 02:10:44.880]  got so bad that they stopped having comments coming in after 138 of them. I
[02:10:44.880 --> 02:10:49.400]  think he probably the only good comment was there was this guy Lowenstein's
[02:10:49.400 --> 02:10:54.400]  mother who's good friends with Jamie Dimon's family. So when you read this
[02:10:54.400 --> 02:11:00.000]  stuff and you see the anger out there it's real but here's the other side. Look
[02:11:00.000 --> 02:11:07.440]  how those brave Barbies beat up all those students. Did you see the one from the
[02:11:07.440 --> 02:11:14.760]  BBC where they grabbed this guy out of a wheelchair and dragged him across the
[02:11:14.760 --> 02:11:22.280]  pavement and this disgusting interviewer on the BBC is saying to the guy you got
[02:11:22.280 --> 02:11:29.320]  to see it. Well they said that you were rolling at them the police and if you
[02:11:29.320 --> 02:11:34.440]  think the media in this country is servile you got to look at theirs it's
[02:11:34.440 --> 02:11:39.520]  just as bad. So what they're going to do is they're going to keep coming harder
[02:11:39.520 --> 02:11:45.440]  and harder down on the people to stop the revolution. So that's what we're up
[02:11:45.440 --> 02:11:50.960]  against. It's going to be a cyber war and it's going to be the real war. It's
[02:11:50.960 --> 02:11:56.600]  going to be the government crackdowns and the people trying to rise up. It's no
[02:11:56.600 --> 02:12:01.040]  different than any other revolution. You know I'm glad you raised that issue
[02:12:01.040 --> 02:12:03.720]  because I want to discuss what you see happening in the next year what's going
[02:12:03.720 --> 02:12:09.320]  to happen in the economy but also the government and the Fortune 100 response
[02:12:09.320 --> 02:12:13.320]  to it but also what you expect to see the population do. But I make these
[02:12:13.320 --> 02:12:20.240]  hardcore scathing videos about the banking system about the telescreens
[02:12:20.240 --> 02:12:24.920]  going in Walmart telling citizens to spy on each other and spy on other
[02:12:24.920 --> 02:12:30.320]  shoppers. I mean it's right in 1984 and if you click on the YouTube like or
[02:12:30.320 --> 02:12:37.360]  dislike depending on the video it'll be 3,000 likes next to 50 something or
[02:12:37.360 --> 02:12:44.440]  100 something dislikes. I mean it's literally 95% of people agree with me
[02:12:44.440 --> 02:12:51.080]  and disagree with the government. Then if you go to the Homeland Security
[02:12:51.080 --> 02:12:58.920]  Official web page per video it will be thousands of dislikes and every comment
[02:12:58.920 --> 02:13:02.360]  hating them and saying we know you're the terrorist we know you're staging the
[02:13:02.360 --> 02:13:07.100]  events why don't you report on yourselves and almost no one liking. In fact
[02:13:07.100 --> 02:13:12.320]  there it is on screen of one of my videos with close to 300,000 views. The
[02:13:12.320 --> 02:13:16.720]  title of the video if folks want to go look at it as Walmart invasion part of
[02:13:16.720 --> 02:13:27.580]  larger DHS takeover of America there is 1,733 likes 94 dislikes. Now again you
[02:13:27.580 --> 02:13:33.320]  go over to the Homeland Security website and it's the flip of that and you
[02:13:33.320 --> 02:13:38.720]  read the comments everyone gets it. You know they're saying you want us to not
[02:13:38.720 --> 02:13:42.840]  trust each other you want us to spy this is like Nazi Germany or East Germany or
[02:13:42.840 --> 02:13:47.680]  Russia hey I want to report on Chertoff ordering the naked body scanners and
[02:13:47.680 --> 02:13:51.840]  then making money off of them. I mean every I mean people are really getting
[02:13:51.840 --> 02:13:57.440]  educated there's an explosive awakening happening and they are saying off with
[02:13:57.440 --> 02:14:01.480]  their heads I'm concerned though and I've seen the government provocateur to
[02:14:01.480 --> 02:14:05.880]  try to start something violent so they have a pretext to clamp down but I want
[02:14:05.880 --> 02:14:10.520]  to warn the government this could backfire on you trying to start a fight
[02:14:10.520 --> 02:14:14.480]  or staging terror attacks like a new Oklahoma City to blame it on the
[02:14:14.480 --> 02:14:19.160]  Liberty Movement. Your comment on the awakening when you see it really going to
[02:14:19.160 --> 02:14:22.440]  flash point and how you see the establishment countering is Gerald
[02:14:22.440 --> 02:14:29.360]  Salente. You know my saying is a Bronx boy when people lose everything and they
[02:14:29.360 --> 02:14:34.640]  have nothing left to lose they lose it and they're losing it because they're
[02:14:34.640 --> 02:14:40.120]  losing their homes they're losing their jobs these guys these people getting it
[02:14:40.120 --> 02:14:44.960]  and women getting out of college again with these degrees in worthlessness they
[02:14:44.960 --> 02:14:49.200]  can't find jobs you think they're angry and they got all that testosterone
[02:14:49.200 --> 02:14:52.960]  running through these guys you think they're gonna take to the streets and
[02:14:52.960 --> 02:14:58.320]  take it out on somebody when is it going to happen it's going to happen when
[02:14:58.320 --> 02:15:04.040]  people finally wake up to the reality that the dollar isn't going to be worth
[02:15:04.040 --> 02:15:10.480]  a dime that all they've saved they've they've saved for nothing they find out
[02:15:10.480 --> 02:15:15.240]  that they're rich as we've seen and I love it now now that it's I've been
[02:15:15.240 --> 02:15:19.160]  saying this I don't know how many years that the gap between the rich and the
[02:15:19.160 --> 02:15:25.960]  poor is the widest in the US than any of the industrialized nations now just now
[02:15:25.960 --> 02:15:32.080]  mainstream media is finally saying that so as they see the richer get richer and
[02:15:32.080 --> 02:15:37.880]  them getting poorer what do they have to lose by taking taking to the streets
[02:15:37.880 --> 02:15:42.280]  nothing so what we're going to look at here's and but I want to make this clear
[02:15:42.280 --> 02:15:48.160]  also we predicted the crash of 2010 it's in the trends journal it was a top
[02:15:48.160 --> 02:15:53.240]  trend that came out last December a year ago what we made it we made it
[02:15:53.240 --> 02:15:57.600]  perfectly clear would not be an equity market crash because it was a rig
[02:15:57.600 --> 02:16:02.200]  market and it was going to be cheap interest rates that keep floating this and
[02:16:02.200 --> 02:16:07.760]  we also said there would be schemes undreamed of that would keep propping
[02:16:07.760 --> 02:16:13.560]  it up and we saw this scheme that just came out as the result of the Frank the
[02:16:13.560 --> 02:16:19.760]  Dodd-Frank bill that the Federal Reserve has dealt loaned and and under the table
[02:16:19.760 --> 02:16:26.320]  dealt over 30 13 trillion dollars all over the world to all different kinds of
[02:16:26.320 --> 02:16:31.680]  companies general electric Holly Davidson McDonald's credit switch
[02:16:31.680 --> 02:16:38.200]  stewardship bank the Tokyo banks Bank of England it's what the con game is that
[02:16:38.200 --> 02:16:43.200]  they're conning us with the bank deals so yeah they're propping it up but what
[02:16:43.200 --> 02:16:50.400]  we're saying is that it's collapsed and people the headline story Alex for the
[02:16:50.400 --> 02:16:55.360]  trends journals top trends that are coming out in a few weeks the 2011 is
[02:16:55.360 --> 02:17:03.720]  wake-up call 2011 only the blind the inept the ideologically driven and
[02:17:03.720 --> 02:17:09.080]  little kids aren't gonna know the deal and the deal is this Europe has
[02:17:09.080 --> 02:17:17.040]  collapsed there is no EU it's gone they're not gonna be able to bail out
[02:17:17.040 --> 02:17:24.520]  Portugal they won't be able to bail out Spain Ireland is toast they're not going
[02:17:24.520 --> 02:17:33.840]  to be able to salvage Italy with its 120% of debt to GDP ratio they won't
[02:17:33.840 --> 02:17:40.440]  salvage Greece the Germans are gonna go off on their own there's going to be a
[02:17:40.440 --> 02:17:47.200]  global currency crisis it's happening in front of us why do you think people why
[02:17:47.200 --> 02:17:56.440]  can't they wake up and see why gold is trading at $1400 an ounce there is no
[02:17:56.440 --> 02:18:02.920]  end in sight but the end will come when the markets collapse and we believe
[02:18:02.920 --> 02:18:11.640]  that there's going to be a global financial crisis a a crack-up in 2011
[02:18:11.640 --> 02:18:18.360]  that people will no longer be able to deny and the world banks will no longer
[02:18:18.360 --> 02:18:24.840]  be able to cover up by printing more of their digital money that's not worth the
[02:18:24.840 --> 02:18:30.880]  paper it's not printed on well Gerald we know that the mega central banks have
[02:18:30.880 --> 02:18:34.480]  wanted to consolidate power but now they're getting desperate they realize
[02:18:34.480 --> 02:18:40.760]  they've destroyed things so bad they're finally actually trying to cut taxes but
[02:18:40.760 --> 02:18:46.920]  it looks like too little too late but here's the model here is the Ireland
[02:18:46.920 --> 02:18:54.280]  banks are all for sale central banker this is out of CNBC and he went on to
[02:18:54.280 --> 02:18:58.760]  say they are for sale as far as I'm concerned I've always been an advocate
[02:18:58.760 --> 02:19:03.160]  for foreign banks to own small countries and he goes on here this is their
[02:19:03.160 --> 02:19:06.880]  central banker they told him a year ago they had the best economy in Europe they
[02:19:06.880 --> 02:19:10.480]  set him up they brought him in and I've seen it the German news the Germans are
[02:19:10.480 --> 02:19:15.520]  saying they're getting ready to leave the Euro if this continues and I've seen
[02:19:15.520 --> 02:19:20.400]  the financial breakdowns this is mathematically impossible to pay back
[02:19:20.400 --> 02:19:24.560]  and the system knows that so they're just trying to suck as much as they can
[02:19:24.560 --> 02:19:29.040]  while telling everybody that everything's fine exactly and by the way
[02:19:29.040 --> 02:19:32.360]  that's where this whole wiki leagues thing comes in that's I don't know if
[02:19:32.360 --> 02:19:37.200]  you saw the video of me on Fox about a week and a half ago when the wiki
[02:19:37.200 --> 02:19:42.280]  league story broke and how they had it how they set me up they had four against
[02:19:42.280 --> 02:19:47.040]  me tell us about it when we get back I didn't see it you're on so much
[02:19:47.040 --> 02:19:50.320]  television I miss a lot of it but I did see it linked on our site but I have a
[02:19:50.320 --> 02:19:54.480]  chance to watch it tell us about that we'll get into this congressman saying
[02:19:54.480 --> 02:19:58.280]  that the Congress is there to serve the banks you can't make this up stay with

[02:20:23.520 --> 02:20:28.240]  power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only
[02:20:28.240 --> 02:20:32.040]  compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to
[02:20:32.040 --> 02:20:35.640]  local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from weather

[02:23:58.360 --> 02:24:17.360]  today.
[02:24:28.360 --> 02:24:32.360]  Alright, let's go right back to Gerald Salente.
[02:24:32.360 --> 02:24:34.360]  Gerald, I'm going to dig it out of my stack.
[02:24:34.360 --> 02:24:39.360]  It's a raw story with the video, with the quote of the congressman saying,
[02:24:39.360 --> 02:24:41.360]  hey, Congress is here for the bankers.
[02:24:41.360 --> 02:24:43.360]  I guess Oxygen is here for them.
[02:24:43.360 --> 02:24:47.360]  They are trying to pass the carbon tax to taxes on carbon dioxide,
[02:24:47.360 --> 02:24:50.360]  and J.P. Morgan Chase Goldman Sachs literally are the main funders.
[02:24:50.360 --> 02:24:55.360]  So I guess the air is theirs because they waddle around and tell us what to do.
[02:24:55.360 --> 02:24:58.360]  But as you said, everybody's starting to wake up to them.
[02:24:58.360 --> 02:25:01.360]  But what about when you look at Ireland,
[02:25:01.360 --> 02:25:04.360]  cutting the benefits that are paid for, raising the taxes,
[02:25:04.360 --> 02:25:07.360]  admitting everything goes to the bankers?
[02:25:07.360 --> 02:25:10.360]  What is this hubris, this arrogance?
[02:25:10.360 --> 02:25:14.360]  Why are they so, like Maria Antoinette saying, let them eat cake?
[02:25:14.360 --> 02:25:17.360]  I mean, is there a method to their madness?
[02:25:17.360 --> 02:25:20.360]  No, they're out of touch, and they should be.
[02:25:20.360 --> 02:25:25.360]  They live lives that are far more protected than us.
[02:25:25.360 --> 02:25:29.360]  Every time they arrive anywhere, they roll out the red carpet.
[02:25:29.360 --> 02:25:32.360]  It's one big circle jerk.
[02:25:32.360 --> 02:25:36.360]  Everybody makes everybody feel so great and important.
[02:25:36.360 --> 02:25:38.360]  Look again with these WikiLeaks.
[02:25:38.360 --> 02:25:39.360]  Look what they do.
[02:25:39.360 --> 02:25:46.360]  They show us these photo ops, all the glad handing, all the big smiles,
[02:25:46.360 --> 02:25:51.360]  and you find out they're nothing but a bunch of crooks, thieves,
[02:25:51.360 --> 02:25:57.360]  criminals, buffoons, suckups, and bowdowns,
[02:25:57.360 --> 02:26:01.360]  and they call it the world leaders.
[02:26:01.360 --> 02:26:03.360]  Look at Berlusconi.
[02:26:03.360 --> 02:26:08.360]  Yeah, the world stage is one big Berlusconi.
[02:26:08.360 --> 02:26:11.360]  So they are totally out of touch.
[02:26:11.360 --> 02:26:15.360]  As I said, their attitude is, you go to work,
[02:26:15.360 --> 02:26:17.360]  you bring me the, bring all the money,
[02:26:17.360 --> 02:26:19.360]  I'll tell you what to do with it.
[02:26:19.360 --> 02:26:24.360]  I'm smarter than you, I'm privileged,
[02:26:24.360 --> 02:26:27.360]  and I walk on red carpets.
[02:26:27.360 --> 02:26:29.360]  So of course they're out of touch.
[02:26:29.360 --> 02:26:33.360]  Look, Alex, what happened in England,
[02:26:33.360 --> 02:26:37.360]  as we're seeing the same thing now happening,
[02:26:37.360 --> 02:26:41.360]  where they're promoting the next royal wedding
[02:26:41.360 --> 02:26:46.360]  as they're making it impossible for kids to go to college,
[02:26:46.360 --> 02:26:51.360]  it's not even let them eat cake, it's let them eat nothing.
[02:26:51.360 --> 02:26:54.360]  They could care less.
[02:26:54.360 --> 02:26:56.360]  They're better than we are.
[02:26:56.360 --> 02:26:59.360]  There's a photo that we have in the trends journal
[02:26:59.360 --> 02:27:02.360]  of Hillary Clinton looking, you know.
[02:27:02.360 --> 02:27:04.360]  Yeah, it's the White Shoe Club.
[02:27:04.360 --> 02:27:06.360]  So they're totally detached.
[02:27:06.360 --> 02:27:11.360]  And so when it happened, and the police unfortunately
[02:27:11.360 --> 02:27:15.360]  are becoming, you know, enforcers for the crime bosses.
[02:27:15.360 --> 02:27:18.360]  They beat up the people, the orders are,
[02:27:18.360 --> 02:27:20.360]  don't touch the top criminals.
[02:27:20.360 --> 02:27:24.360]  Have you seen anybody go to jail
[02:27:24.360 --> 02:27:27.360]  from any of the big banks, the Lehman Brothers,
[02:27:27.360 --> 02:27:31.360]  the Merrill Lynch mob, the Goldman Sachs bag.
[02:27:31.360 --> 02:27:33.360]  No, they've been burning little bitty, low level guys
[02:27:33.360 --> 02:27:37.360]  in million dollar deals, trillion dollar swindles,
[02:27:37.360 --> 02:27:39.360]  and they just roll the red carpet out
[02:27:39.360 --> 02:27:42.360]  and Congress just grovels when they see Greenspan.
[02:27:42.360 --> 02:27:44.360]  They just fall to their knees and go,
[02:27:44.360 --> 02:27:48.360]  my lord, my king, rape me.
[02:27:48.360 --> 02:27:52.360]  So the cops have the, you don't touch the big guys.
[02:27:52.360 --> 02:27:54.360]  They got the orders.
[02:27:54.360 --> 02:27:57.360]  And they can't beat the crime guys on the street,
[02:27:57.360 --> 02:28:01.360]  you know, the bloods and the crypts and the rest of them,
[02:28:01.360 --> 02:28:04.360]  which is a growing organization,
[02:28:04.360 --> 02:28:06.360]  that's an industry that's thriving.
[02:28:06.360 --> 02:28:08.360]  They can't beat the Mexican mafia crimes exploding,
[02:28:08.360 --> 02:28:11.360]  but they can sure, I've seen old ladies pulled over in Austin
[02:28:11.360 --> 02:28:13.360]  with cops walk up with their hands on their guns,
[02:28:13.360 --> 02:28:16.360]  with two old women in a convertible, you know,
[02:28:16.360 --> 02:28:18.360]  Seabreeze car or whatever.
[02:28:18.360 --> 02:28:20.360]  But then when they see real criminals,
[02:28:20.360 --> 02:28:22.360]  they just seem to grovel in fear.
[02:28:22.360 --> 02:28:23.360]  So that's what's happened.
[02:28:23.360 --> 02:28:25.360]  The cops have become the crime bosses,
[02:28:25.360 --> 02:28:27.360]  the enforcers for the crime bosses.
[02:28:27.360 --> 02:28:29.360]  By the way, crime, that's going to be one of them.
[02:28:29.360 --> 02:28:32.360]  But crime wave 2011, this thing's starting to break loose.
[02:28:32.360 --> 02:28:35.360]  And as you pointed out, they're cooking the numbers.
[02:28:35.360 --> 02:28:36.360]  What a surprise.
[02:28:36.360 --> 02:28:38.360]  They cook the inflation numbers.
[02:28:38.360 --> 02:28:40.360]  They cook the unemployment numbers.
[02:28:40.360 --> 02:28:43.360]  They cook the numbers about how many people we've killed
[02:28:43.360 --> 02:28:46.360]  and they've killed in Iraq and Afghanistan.
[02:28:46.360 --> 02:28:48.360]  And they're lying about the crime numbers.
[02:28:48.360 --> 02:28:52.360]  It's going to get much worse and it's worldwide.
[02:28:52.360 --> 02:28:55.360]  And criminal activity, by the way, is accepted.
[02:28:55.360 --> 02:28:57.360]  If you see it on Wall Street,
[02:28:57.360 --> 02:28:59.360]  why not everybody else?
[02:28:59.360 --> 02:29:01.360]  So it's gaining the welfare system,
[02:29:01.360 --> 02:29:05.360]  gaining the system to become disabled
[02:29:05.360 --> 02:29:08.360]  or ripping off the system from the top.
[02:29:08.360 --> 02:29:11.360]  So as people start losing more and more,
[02:29:11.360 --> 02:29:13.360]  crime is going to go higher and higher.
[02:29:13.360 --> 02:29:16.360]  I don't care what these academics
[02:29:16.360 --> 02:29:19.360]  and these crime experts say
[02:29:19.360 --> 02:29:21.360]  that there's no relevant evidence.
[02:29:21.360 --> 02:29:24.360]  Gerald, I mean, half the places I go to,
[02:29:24.360 --> 02:29:26.360]  businesses are now being robbed,
[02:29:26.360 --> 02:29:28.360]  even in nice areas of town.
[02:29:28.360 --> 02:29:31.360]  Cars are getting smashed into, homes are getting robbed.
[02:29:31.360 --> 02:29:33.360]  But then I read in the news, they say,
[02:29:33.360 --> 02:29:36.360]  oh, crime's not up in Austin and unemployment's not up.
[02:29:36.360 --> 02:29:38.360]  Everything is wonderful.
[02:29:38.360 --> 02:29:41.360]  Sit down and shut up.
[02:29:41.360 --> 02:29:43.360]  I want to come back and get into more trends this year
[02:29:43.360 --> 02:29:46.360]  and get into this Alabama Republican.
[02:29:46.360 --> 02:29:48.360]  Spencer Bacchus says,
[02:29:48.360 --> 02:29:50.360]  we are here to serve the banks.
[02:29:50.360 --> 02:29:51.360]  That's a quote.
[02:29:51.360 --> 02:29:52.360]  We're on the march.
[02:29:52.360 --> 02:29:54.360]  The empire's on the run.

[02:31:34.360 --> 02:31:37.360]  detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet,

[02:33:08.360 --> 02:33:10.360]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:33:10.360 --> 02:33:15.360]  I want to get into a host of issues with Gerald Salinde
[02:33:15.360 --> 02:33:17.360]  before he leaves us here at the end of the hour.
[02:33:17.360 --> 02:33:21.360]  Maybe he will twist his arm to come on on the last show of the year,
[02:33:21.360 --> 02:33:24.360]  not this next week, but the week after with his predictions
[02:33:24.360 --> 02:33:27.360]  in rapid succession for 2011,
[02:33:27.360 --> 02:33:30.360]  but I'm going to get some of those from him here in a moment.
[02:33:30.360 --> 02:33:32.360]  But here it is.
[02:33:32.360 --> 02:33:34.360]  Regulators exist to serve the banks.
[02:33:34.360 --> 02:33:37.360]  Next House Finance Chairman declares.
[02:33:37.360 --> 02:33:42.360]  So that's the guy above the committee that Paul runs.
[02:33:42.360 --> 02:33:46.360]  Paul is able to subpoena and get dirt on the Fed,
[02:33:46.360 --> 02:33:49.360]  but the big committee above him says we are here to serve them.
[02:33:49.360 --> 02:33:51.360]  Listen to this.
[02:33:51.360 --> 02:33:54.360]  Alabama Republican Spencer Baucus,
[02:33:54.360 --> 02:33:57.360]  the incoming chairman of the House Banking Committee,
[02:33:57.360 --> 02:33:59.360]  suggests Congress and federal regulators
[02:33:59.360 --> 02:34:03.360]  should play a subservient role with banks.
[02:34:03.360 --> 02:34:08.360]  Remember a year ago, a green span on the former chairman of the Fed,
[02:34:08.360 --> 02:34:11.360]  on PBS saying we're outside government, we run the government,
[02:34:11.360 --> 02:34:13.360]  no one can regulate us.
[02:34:13.360 --> 02:34:15.360]  I mean, this is just made up pure arrogance.
[02:34:15.360 --> 02:34:18.360]  No wonder we're being completely robbed by these people.
[02:34:18.360 --> 02:34:20.360]  It's in the Constitution.
[02:34:20.360 --> 02:34:22.360]  It's we the people, and the Congress controls that.
[02:34:22.360 --> 02:34:27.360]  Just because some monkey tells us in a fancy suit that he rules us,
[02:34:27.360 --> 02:34:30.360]  or because some monkey government tells us men in uniforms
[02:34:30.360 --> 02:34:32.360]  are going to stick their hands down our pants,
[02:34:32.360 --> 02:34:35.360]  doesn't mean they can do it.
[02:34:35.360 --> 02:34:39.360]  Here's the quote from Spencer Baucus.
[02:34:39.360 --> 02:34:43.360]  In Washington, the view is that banks are to be regulated,
[02:34:43.360 --> 02:34:48.360]  and my view is that Washington and the regulators are there to serve the banks.
[02:34:48.360 --> 02:34:52.360]  Well, yeah, most of them are former Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan people,
[02:34:52.360 --> 02:34:54.360]  Foxes guarding the henhouse.
[02:34:54.360 --> 02:34:58.360]  Baucus told the Birmingham News in an interview, and it goes on.
[02:34:58.360 --> 02:35:02.360]  I mean, totally disconnected.
[02:35:02.360 --> 02:35:04.360]  Okay, well, Congress isn't involved with the banks,
[02:35:04.360 --> 02:35:06.360]  or doesn't have any power over them,
[02:35:06.360 --> 02:35:08.360]  that we shouldn't have to pay them all this bailout money.
[02:35:08.360 --> 02:35:10.360]  Gerald Salente.
[02:35:10.360 --> 02:35:16.360]  Well, I think the congressman is expressing his feelings about the type of person he is,
[02:35:16.360 --> 02:35:18.360]  and the rest of the most of Congress,
[02:35:18.360 --> 02:35:21.360]  with the exception of Ron Paul and a few others,
[02:35:21.360 --> 02:35:24.360]  just suck ups and bow downs.
[02:35:24.360 --> 02:35:26.360]  I tell you, Alex, the worst job I ever had
[02:35:26.360 --> 02:35:30.360]  was when I was the assistant to the secretary of the New York State Senate,
[02:35:30.360 --> 02:35:33.360]  and I watched grown men grovel all day long,
[02:35:33.360 --> 02:35:35.360]  and I had lousy jobs in my day.
[02:35:35.360 --> 02:35:38.360]  Well, that was the worst, when I was a young man at a graduate school.
[02:35:38.360 --> 02:35:40.360]  So this is who they are.
[02:35:40.360 --> 02:35:44.360]  They're used to bowing, bending over, and sucking up,
[02:35:44.360 --> 02:35:46.360]  so they feel we should, too.
[02:35:46.360 --> 02:35:51.360]  And I'm sick and tired of them telling me what I should believe,
[02:35:51.360 --> 02:35:53.360]  what I should think, and what I should do.
[02:35:53.360 --> 02:36:00.360]  But the fact is, go back to our 2008 trend alert
[02:36:00.360 --> 02:36:03.360]  when they came out with the tarp scheme.
[02:36:03.360 --> 02:36:10.360]  The headline read, DC Heist, Wall Street Hijacks Washington.
[02:36:10.360 --> 02:36:12.360]  History was made.
[02:36:12.360 --> 02:36:15.360]  It happened right before our eyes.
[02:36:15.360 --> 02:36:19.360]  You talked about Reuben, you talked about Geithner,
[02:36:19.360 --> 02:36:21.360]  you talked about Gensler,
[02:36:21.360 --> 02:36:24.360]  you talked about the rest of the Goldman Sachs gang.
[02:36:24.360 --> 02:36:27.360]  Remember Henry Paulson?
[02:36:27.360 --> 02:36:32.360]  Frankenstein couldn't have had a better mask than that guy.
[02:36:32.360 --> 02:36:37.360]  Well, you broke it all down in Obama Deception and Fall of the Republic.
[02:36:37.360 --> 02:36:40.360]  In both of my films, all of it is now unfolded,
[02:36:40.360 --> 02:36:42.360]  and if they can steal 20 something trillion,
[02:36:42.360 --> 02:36:44.360]  why not steal 1,000 trillion?
[02:36:44.360 --> 02:36:46.360]  Why not go completely crazy?
[02:36:46.360 --> 02:36:49.360]  Now, earlier, you tried to get into WikiLeaks,
[02:36:49.360 --> 02:36:52.360]  and then we went to break, and I forgot to bring it back up.
[02:36:52.360 --> 02:36:54.360]  Talk about what happened to you on Fox.
[02:36:54.360 --> 02:36:57.360]  Well, they brought me on, and there's like five against one.
[02:36:57.360 --> 02:37:02.360]  It's in the media blog on our, in the TrendsTheJournal.com.
[02:37:02.360 --> 02:37:06.360]  And they had a CIA guy, you know, with that look, you know,
[02:37:06.360 --> 02:37:11.360]  blonde handsome guy, you know, get used to it.
[02:37:11.360 --> 02:37:14.360]  Get used to the crime and the corruption.
[02:37:14.360 --> 02:37:16.360]  That's the real world.
[02:37:16.360 --> 02:37:20.360]  What I was saying is this isn't about who leaked what and how.
[02:37:20.360 --> 02:37:26.360]  They're upset because it's uncovering what a bunch of losers they are.
[02:37:26.360 --> 02:37:32.360]  I want to get this into everybody's minds so you don't let go of it.
[02:37:32.360 --> 02:37:36.360]  The same people that they call diplomats, ambassadors,
[02:37:36.360 --> 02:37:42.360]  your senators, your congressmen, your legislators, your presidents, your mayors,
[02:37:42.360 --> 02:37:48.360]  these are the same people you couldn't stand in high school and college
[02:37:48.360 --> 02:37:54.360]  that wanted to become the class presidents and the head of the student council.
[02:37:54.360 --> 02:38:00.360]  What WikiLeaks is showing is that's exactly who they are.
[02:38:00.360 --> 02:38:03.360]  They're the inept and the incompetent.
[02:38:03.360 --> 02:38:09.360]  They're doing dirty deals, and it's being uncovered, and they're going ballistic.
[02:38:09.360 --> 02:38:13.360]  Because that's the only thing that's holding it together.
[02:38:13.360 --> 02:38:16.360]  There's nobody behind the curtain.
[02:38:16.360 --> 02:38:19.360]  It's what you see is what you get.
[02:38:19.360 --> 02:38:25.360]  How disgusting does it have to become when Obama walks on the stage
[02:38:25.360 --> 02:38:34.360]  and gives it to slick willy to jam legislation down the throats of everybody?
[02:38:34.360 --> 02:38:36.360]  Change you could believe in?
[02:38:36.360 --> 02:38:45.360]  Man, it looks like an old act to me is really a lousy repeat of an old movie.
[02:38:45.360 --> 02:38:50.360]  The sequels as bad as the original, and that's what they're doing.
[02:38:50.360 --> 02:38:52.360]  That's the outrage of WikiLeaks.
[02:38:52.360 --> 02:38:55.360]  And why aren't they going after the New York Times?
[02:38:55.360 --> 02:39:00.360]  Why aren't they going after the Guardian and their spiegel?
[02:39:00.360 --> 02:39:02.360]  Why not?
[02:39:02.360 --> 02:39:04.360]  Why they're printing this stuff?
[02:39:04.360 --> 02:39:06.360]  Why go after this guy?
[02:39:06.360 --> 02:39:09.360]  And I read all the information that's come out.
[02:39:09.360 --> 02:39:14.360]  You know what the charges are when you read his so-called rape charges?
[02:39:14.360 --> 02:39:16.360]  He gets sex without a condom.
[02:39:16.360 --> 02:39:21.360]  This is classic feminism, and then both the women, especially one of them,
[02:39:21.360 --> 02:39:28.360]  have worked for high-level CIA operations in Cuba, and this is a complete setup.
[02:39:28.360 --> 02:39:30.360]  Who can make this stuff up?
[02:39:30.360 --> 02:39:35.360]  I mean, it's like a Disney story, you know.
[02:39:35.360 --> 02:39:39.360]  Snow White had sex with the seven dwarfs, and they didn't use a condom?
[02:39:39.360 --> 02:39:41.360]  I mean, come on.
[02:39:41.360 --> 02:39:47.360]  We're fighting, we're in immoral wars in Iraq and in Afghanistan.
[02:39:47.360 --> 02:39:53.360]  Hey, how about sending predator drones into sovereign countries and killing, quote,
[02:39:53.360 --> 02:40:00.360]  suspected militants? Did anybody have a year of extrajudicial killings?
[02:40:00.360 --> 02:40:04.360]  How about going to war for fake reasons?
[02:40:04.360 --> 02:40:07.360]  There is no weapons of mass destruction.
[02:40:07.360 --> 02:40:11.360]  There were no ties to Al Qaeda, and there's Bush out there,
[02:40:11.360 --> 02:40:16.360]  hawking his book, and they're busting a guy for not using a condom?
[02:40:16.360 --> 02:40:19.360]  Well, it gets worse. I mean, Bush...
[02:40:19.360 --> 02:40:26.360]  And that's the level of what we're talking about, who these people are,
[02:40:26.360 --> 02:40:30.360]  and it's being exposed, and they don't like it.
[02:40:30.360 --> 02:40:34.360]  Well, you're right, and Bush, we got the White House memos,
[02:40:34.360 --> 02:40:39.360]  we got the memos from John Yu, and Attorney General Gonzalez,
[02:40:39.360 --> 02:40:45.360]  where they ordered the torture, and it said, including crushing children's genitals with pliers.
[02:40:45.360 --> 02:40:49.360]  I'm sorry to have to talk about that. The Army's own report admitted children
[02:40:49.360 --> 02:40:54.360]  being sexually abused with battery acid. Folks, you can't make this up.
[02:40:54.360 --> 02:40:56.360]  In fact, I'm not going to say the rest of it on air.
[02:40:56.360 --> 02:41:00.360]  Against these children to make their parents give false confessions,
[02:41:00.360 --> 02:41:06.360]  they send the sadist to prison as scapegoats once they get caught.
[02:41:06.360 --> 02:41:11.360]  Then Bush comes out twice this year and says he ordered torture, he'd do it again,
[02:41:11.360 --> 02:41:15.360]  but he's not in prison, so he's like the Gambino crime boss,
[02:41:15.360 --> 02:41:21.360]  and meanwhile his soldiers have been caught carrying out criminal operations.
[02:41:21.360 --> 02:41:25.360]  They go to prison, and the crime boss comes out on TV and says,
[02:41:25.360 --> 02:41:30.360]  I ordered it, and he doesn't get in trouble. I mean, this is so brazen.
[02:41:30.360 --> 02:41:36.360]  Well, that's what's going on. As I said, the police have become the enforcers for the crime bosses.
[02:41:36.360 --> 02:41:42.360]  They're above everybody else. I watched Bush give some of those interviews.
[02:41:42.360 --> 02:41:46.360]  He's some royalty. Oh, the great Bush family.
[02:41:46.360 --> 02:41:49.360]  What was the great grandfather, the grandfather's name, Prescott Bush?
[02:41:49.360 --> 02:41:50.360]  Yeah, Tom Nazi.
[02:41:50.360 --> 02:41:53.360]  Wasn't he doing deals with the Nazis?
[02:41:53.360 --> 02:41:54.360]  Yes.
[02:41:54.360 --> 02:41:56.360]  Yeah. I mean, come on with this stuff.
[02:41:56.360 --> 02:42:00.360]  Harvard, Princeton, Yale, bullets, bombs, and banks.
[02:42:00.360 --> 02:42:02.360]  I've said it, and that's what it is.
[02:42:02.360 --> 02:42:06.360]  They're robbing us. This is the greatest bank robbery in world history,
[02:42:06.360 --> 02:42:09.360]  and the banks are doing the robbing.
[02:42:09.360 --> 02:42:12.360]  And when we were talking about the crime wave, by the way,
[02:42:12.360 --> 02:42:16.360]  look at the security business. It's booming.
[02:42:16.360 --> 02:42:19.360]  You crawl up and try to get alarms installed.
[02:42:19.360 --> 02:42:24.360]  You're going to get on a waiting list, and it's going to get a lot worse.
[02:42:24.360 --> 02:42:27.360]  If people want to see the businesses to get into,
[02:42:27.360 --> 02:42:34.360]  boy, anything having to do with crime-related security is going to be a growth industry.
[02:42:34.360 --> 02:42:39.360]  Look at firearms, record sales, and modern history for two years and running,
[02:42:39.360 --> 02:42:42.360]  and you look at the graphs, it's only going up parabolic.
[02:42:42.360 --> 02:42:46.360]  Now, I want to shift gears into some other areas.
[02:42:46.360 --> 02:42:48.360]  And again, I can't say this on air.
[02:42:48.360 --> 02:42:52.360]  We never used to talk about things like this, but it's always in the news.
[02:42:52.360 --> 02:42:53.360]  We're forced to.
[02:42:53.360 --> 02:42:58.360]  This is up on PrisonPlanet.com, K.O.B., CBS TV's reporting it.
[02:42:58.360 --> 02:43:01.360]  It's up on PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:43:01.360 --> 02:43:03.360]  These reports have been confirmed.
[02:43:03.360 --> 02:43:07.360]  They make fun of other TSA workers, genitals, female workers.
[02:43:07.360 --> 02:43:12.360]  They're hiring a bunch of lunatics because only a mentally ill person
[02:43:12.360 --> 02:43:16.360]  could put people in radiation bathers, stick their hands down people's pants.
[02:43:16.360 --> 02:43:21.360]  They're creating an army who will follow any order to then take over the streets.
[02:43:21.360 --> 02:43:24.360]  But here's the PrisonPlanet.com Steve Watson article.
[02:43:24.360 --> 02:43:27.360]  Just went up at PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:43:27.360 --> 02:43:32.360]  Boy asked TSA, why pat down my mom and not me?
[02:43:32.360 --> 02:43:39.360]  TSA replies, and they have witnesses because you don't have B-word.
[02:43:39.360 --> 02:43:44.360]  And I've seen this where they see a good-looking woman.
[02:43:44.360 --> 02:43:45.360]  It is over.
[02:43:45.360 --> 02:43:48.360]  These are men that could never get a woman, many of them.
[02:43:48.360 --> 02:43:52.360]  Some of them are just guys that want jobs, and they've been caught being child molesters,
[02:43:52.360 --> 02:43:55.360]  planting drugs on women, demanding sex.
[02:43:55.360 --> 02:43:59.360]  I mean, these are the worst type of power-tripping low-grade morons.
[02:43:59.360 --> 02:44:03.360]  What is your take on the whole TSA situation, General Salente?
[02:44:03.360 --> 02:44:10.360]  Well, first of all, I want to thank you for doing all that you have done to expose this.
[02:44:10.360 --> 02:44:18.360]  Nobody in the United States anywhere has done more to show what's going on than you have
[02:44:18.360 --> 02:44:25.360]  about breaking it down piece by piece from that little weasel shirt-off the former homeland
[02:44:25.360 --> 02:44:34.360]  securities are going out after the so-called Christmas Day bomber was going to explode
[02:44:34.360 --> 02:44:41.360]  as underwear and making the rounds on the major media and telling us that we needed
[02:44:41.360 --> 02:44:50.360]  these full-body X-ray machines, not ever, ever divulging that shirt-off group was the
[02:44:50.360 --> 02:44:55.360]  consulting firm for RapidScam that sells these things.
[02:44:55.360 --> 02:45:01.360]  So you've done more than anybody, and what this is so important about, it's one of those
[02:45:01.360 --> 02:45:07.360]  elements in the coming Second American Revolution, because we know we're getting robbed by the
[02:45:07.360 --> 02:45:08.360]  bankers.
[02:45:08.360 --> 02:45:14.360]  A lot of us know that these wars are immoral and that we're wasting trillions of dollars
[02:45:14.360 --> 02:45:18.360]  fighting them, and it comes out of our paychecks.
[02:45:18.360 --> 02:45:21.360]  But what we know, it's removed.
[02:45:21.360 --> 02:45:29.360]  But when you go to the airport and you're humiliated in front of huge crowds, it's a
[02:45:29.360 --> 02:45:31.360]  different story.
[02:45:31.360 --> 02:45:39.360]  When you go to the airport and you're subjugated to such behavior, and it's really from a
[02:45:39.360 --> 02:45:47.360]  man standpoint or a woman's, there's nothing more to subjugate somebody than to tell them
[02:45:47.360 --> 02:45:54.360]  that I could grope you and feel you up and do whatever I want and you can't do anything
[02:45:54.360 --> 02:45:55.360]  about it.
[02:45:55.360 --> 02:46:00.360]  I tell you, they put you in boxes, I mean, the goons doing it don't know why they're
[02:46:00.360 --> 02:46:04.360]  doing it, but the social engineers know this is an act of submission.
[02:46:04.360 --> 02:46:06.360]  This is learning how to be a prisoner.
[02:46:06.360 --> 02:46:11.360]  I mean, I haven't been in jail a lot, but I was in juvenile a couple times for really
[02:46:11.360 --> 02:46:14.360]  fights where they didn't know who'd started it, so everybody goes to jail.
[02:46:14.360 --> 02:46:21.360]  I've been in jail from protest, and I wasn't treated this bad in jail as you're treated
[02:46:21.360 --> 02:46:23.360]  in an airport.
[02:46:23.360 --> 02:46:25.360]  You got it.
[02:46:25.360 --> 02:46:28.360]  It's a form of submission, so here's what they do.
[02:46:28.360 --> 02:46:33.360]  First, they take your money, and they tell you, taking your money, and I'm giving it
[02:46:33.360 --> 02:46:40.360]  to my big friends, so they knock you down like that, and now they knock you down again
[02:46:40.360 --> 02:46:44.360]  by, I'm coming back from Las Vegas a couple of weeks ago.
[02:46:44.360 --> 02:46:48.360]  I'm sitting next to an 82-year-old woman.
[02:46:48.360 --> 02:46:53.360]  She reminded my aunt Zizi, may her soul rest in peace, big, chubby face.
[02:46:53.360 --> 02:46:58.360]  She got frisked because they found needles in her luggage.
[02:46:58.360 --> 02:47:00.360]  She's a diabetic.
[02:47:00.360 --> 02:47:04.360]  She said, why are you doing this to an old lady?
[02:47:04.360 --> 02:47:09.360]  They were doing it right out in front of everybody, feeling her up, and she demanded
[02:47:09.360 --> 02:47:12.360]  that they take her into a private room.
[02:47:12.360 --> 02:47:22.360]  They forced this poor old lady to walk across the floor, this filthy floor, without her shoes.
[02:47:22.360 --> 02:47:24.360]  They made her leave her shoes behind.
[02:47:24.360 --> 02:47:30.360]  What they're doing, Alex, is they're breaking us down, bit by bit by bit, and then they got
[02:47:30.360 --> 02:47:32.360]  the goon squads out there.
[02:47:32.360 --> 02:47:34.360]  You go over that yellow line.
[02:47:34.360 --> 02:47:37.360]  You go five miles over the limit.
[02:47:37.360 --> 02:47:42.360]  You have two drinks and you're a fraction over the line.
[02:47:42.360 --> 02:47:44.360]  You're treated like a criminal.
[02:47:44.360 --> 02:47:47.360]  But the big guys get all the breaks.
[02:47:47.360 --> 02:47:49.360]  Look at that guy, Elliot Spitzer.
[02:47:49.360 --> 02:47:54.360]  There is nothing more in your face, arrogance.
[02:47:54.360 --> 02:47:59.360]  For those that don't know, he put a law in place to throw the bucket people that visit
[02:47:59.360 --> 02:48:04.360]  hookers, and I'm not condoning it, but I mean, come on, increasing the law on something
[02:48:04.360 --> 02:48:09.360]  nonviolent and consensual, then he gets busted and now he gets a TV show.
[02:48:09.360 --> 02:48:10.360]  Exactly.
[02:48:10.360 --> 02:48:16.360]  And not only does he get busted and have a TV show, he spends thousands on hookers,
[02:48:16.360 --> 02:48:22.360]  and he doesn't, he's not prosecuted for the crime that he put in place.
[02:48:22.360 --> 02:48:29.360]  There is, you know, the word justice means just us, not them.
[02:48:29.360 --> 02:48:34.360]  Gerald, we've only got about seven, eight minutes left with you powerful intel today.
[02:48:34.360 --> 02:48:38.360]  Now, there's so many issues to cover here, but we know what tyranny is.
[02:48:38.360 --> 02:48:43.360]  It's when control freaks get into power and go wild and they think they're invincible
[02:48:43.360 --> 02:48:45.360]  until they push it too far.
[02:48:45.360 --> 02:48:48.360]  You say 2011 is off with their heads.
[02:48:48.360 --> 02:48:54.360]  What else do you see trending that we haven't talked about coming up in 2011 into 2012?
[02:48:54.360 --> 02:48:59.360]  Some of the positive things, but there's a negative side to it because what's going on
[02:48:59.360 --> 02:49:02.360]  is there's going to be a fortune in food.
[02:49:02.360 --> 02:49:09.360]  There's going to be a strong demand for high quality foods, eggs that you can really eat
[02:49:09.360 --> 02:49:14.360]  that don't come from Auschwitz farms, these chicken coop concentration camps.
[02:49:14.360 --> 02:49:16.360]  It's going to be a huge trend.
[02:49:16.360 --> 02:49:19.360]  Another one, student revolts.
[02:49:19.360 --> 02:49:20.360]  This is going to be big.
[02:49:20.360 --> 02:49:21.360]  It's going on already.
[02:49:21.360 --> 02:49:27.360]  You said that three years ago and it's now happening this year in California, Europe.
[02:49:27.360 --> 02:49:36.360]  Throughout Europe, Italy, Ireland, England, Greece, again, Spain, they have an unemployment rate
[02:49:36.360 --> 02:49:40.360]  of 18 to 26 year olds at about 50%.
[02:49:40.360 --> 02:49:45.360]  You think these guys are going to start taking to the streets and becoming involved in crime?
[02:49:45.360 --> 02:49:51.360]  Student revolts and cyber wars, a big year for cyber wars.
[02:49:51.360 --> 02:49:57.360]  By the way, one of the other trends that we're writing about that you're on the forefront of
[02:49:57.360 --> 02:50:00.360]  is journalism 2.0.
[02:50:00.360 --> 02:50:08.360]  What we do at the Trends Journal, this is the new journalism that people are going to be tuned into
[02:50:08.360 --> 02:50:16.360]  rather than watching these shills and suck ups on these shows from mainstream media.
[02:50:16.360 --> 02:50:24.360]  Now the fight is going to be between closing down the internet as you keep pointing out
[02:50:24.360 --> 02:50:27.360]  or letting freedom ring.
[02:50:27.360 --> 02:50:35.360]  This whole citizen journalism is going to be a huge trend because just as they're watching us,
[02:50:35.360 --> 02:50:38.360]  now we're watching them.
[02:50:38.360 --> 02:50:41.360]  People have their cell phone cameras.
[02:50:41.360 --> 02:50:47.360]  People are taking videos and recording things that they never wanted exposed before.
[02:50:47.360 --> 02:50:48.360]  Oh, that's key.
[02:50:48.360 --> 02:50:53.360]  That's why they're pushing so much now in 9,000 locations to get us to spy on each other
[02:50:53.360 --> 02:50:58.360]  because they don't want us to start surveilling and watching and exposing them.
[02:50:58.360 --> 02:51:01.360]  They want us all divide and conquer.
[02:51:01.360 --> 02:51:02.360]  Exactly.
[02:51:02.360 --> 02:51:04.360]  And that's what the WikiLeaks is about.
[02:51:04.360 --> 02:51:07.360]  It's exposing them.
[02:51:07.360 --> 02:51:11.360]  The emperors have no clothes.
[02:51:11.360 --> 02:51:16.360]  Sarkozy, Merkel, Berlusconi, Obama.
[02:51:16.360 --> 02:51:18.360]  You go down the line.
[02:51:18.360 --> 02:51:26.360]  All of those stands, Turkmenistan, Krizikstan, Uzbekistan, one stand criminal after another.
[02:51:26.360 --> 02:51:30.360]  You read this stuff, you can't make it up.
[02:51:30.360 --> 02:51:32.360]  So that's the fight.
[02:51:32.360 --> 02:51:41.360]  To stop exposing them and to push us into submission, we don't think it's going to happen.
[02:51:41.360 --> 02:51:46.360]  And the major trend is going to be it's the wake-up call.
[02:51:46.360 --> 02:51:49.360]  The revolution has begun.
[02:51:49.360 --> 02:51:54.360]  Oh, by the way, you're also going to hear a lot of chatter for the end of the world,
[02:51:54.360 --> 02:51:57.360]  a lot of that Mayan prophecy, Armageddon stuff.
[02:51:57.360 --> 02:51:59.360]  And guess what?
[02:51:59.360 --> 02:52:08.360]  What's going to be going on in 2011 is going to make it feel as though the world's going to come to a collapse in 2012.
[02:52:08.360 --> 02:52:11.360]  Oh, by the way, there's those other little things.
[02:52:11.360 --> 02:52:13.360]  The war's in Korea.
[02:52:13.360 --> 02:52:15.360]  They're not going to go away either.
[02:52:15.360 --> 02:52:20.360]  And believe me, nobody's going to stop North Korea.
[02:52:20.360 --> 02:52:25.360]  If they keep pushing them, they're going to bomb Seoul out of Bolivia.
[02:52:25.360 --> 02:52:30.360]  They're not that far away and they have the weapons to do it and watch Iran.
[02:52:30.360 --> 02:52:34.360]  And as we're seeing with these WikiLeaks, another one.
[02:52:34.360 --> 02:52:44.360]  The so-called UN nuclear arms inspectors caught on tape being reported from the U.S. Embassy
[02:52:44.360 --> 02:52:50.360]  that he's partial to the United States and he doesn't like the Iranians.
[02:52:50.360 --> 02:52:53.360]  Oh, yeah, there's a fair deal for you.
[02:52:53.360 --> 02:52:55.360]  Wow.
[02:52:55.360 --> 02:52:57.360]  Gerald, we've only got about a minute left.
[02:52:57.360 --> 02:53:02.360]  The websites are infowars.com, prisonplanet.com, your site, trendsresearch.com,
[02:53:02.360 --> 02:53:06.360]  and it's great to subscribe and valuable in-depth intel,
[02:53:06.360 --> 02:53:08.360]  but also for folks that are on budgets.
[02:53:08.360 --> 02:53:11.360]  You can email the Trends Research and get some really good specials,
[02:53:11.360 --> 02:53:16.360]  or completely discounted in some cases, trendsresearch.com.
[02:53:16.360 --> 02:53:18.360]  We've got about 45 seconds left.
[02:53:18.360 --> 02:53:21.360]  Hopefully, you know, I said this is the last time we talked to you this year,
[02:53:21.360 --> 02:53:24.360]  but the more I think about it, so many things are moving so quick.
[02:53:24.360 --> 02:53:30.360]  I'd probably like to get you up in the last few days on Thursday or Friday of this year,
[02:53:30.360 --> 02:53:32.360]  coming up in about two weeks, Gerald.
[02:53:32.360 --> 02:53:34.360]  Do you think you can do that, or are you going to be traveling?
[02:53:34.360 --> 02:53:36.360]  I'm not sure yet.
[02:53:36.360 --> 02:53:39.360]  I don't know offhand what the schedule looks like,
[02:53:39.360 --> 02:53:45.360]  but believe me, I'll do my very best no matter where I am or what I'm doing to be on your show,
[02:53:45.360 --> 02:53:48.360]  because nobody does what Alex Jones does.
[02:53:48.360 --> 02:53:51.360]  Nobody does what Gerald Salente does. You've also got Dr. Paul Craig Roberts,
[02:53:51.360 --> 02:53:54.360]  former head of policy at the Treasury on the team, incredible research,
[02:53:54.360 --> 02:53:57.360]  and regardless then, have a great Christmas, a great New Year.
[02:53:57.360 --> 02:54:01.360]  We may see you, or we may see you early next year, God willing.
[02:54:01.360 --> 02:54:04.360]  I salute you, and have a great Christmas.
[02:54:04.360 --> 02:54:07.360]  Merry Christmas to you. Buon Natale.
[02:54:07.360 --> 02:54:10.360]  He's got his Christmas candles behind him, too. What a great guy.
[02:54:10.360 --> 02:54:12.360]  Great hospitality up there on my cruise,
[02:54:12.360 --> 02:54:15.360]  going up there to interview him for Obama Deception and Fall of the Republic.
[02:54:15.360 --> 02:54:22.360]  We have another amazing trends forecaster coming up after this break
[02:54:22.360 --> 02:54:28.360]  with Stansbury Research, and I really, really look forward to Porter Stansbury
[02:54:28.360 --> 02:54:31.360]  joining us for a full hour. We may even go into overdrive,
[02:54:31.360 --> 02:54:37.360]  but I briefly wanted to bring Ted Anderson up because Golden Silver is rocketing up yet again,
[02:54:37.360 --> 02:54:39.360]  and I don't know how to explain this.
[02:54:39.360 --> 02:54:43.360]  The best deals, because I shop around, are these radio specials?
[02:54:43.360 --> 02:54:45.360]  Might as already has great deals on Golden Silver,
[02:54:45.360 --> 02:54:47.360]  but these radio specials are lost leaders.
[02:54:47.360 --> 02:54:53.360]  Three Silver Dollars, free shipping, and three of my best-selling films for $97.
[02:54:53.360 --> 02:54:57.360]  No one, that's over a $60 value, a $60 discount.
[02:54:57.360 --> 02:55:02.360]  That's $160 value for $97, so it's $63 off.
[02:55:02.360 --> 02:55:07.360]  He's got deals on Frank Goldcoin, Silver Half Dollars, Silver Dollars, Sovereigns.
[02:55:07.360 --> 02:55:10.360]  Ted, tell us where Golden Silver is today,
[02:55:10.360 --> 02:55:13.360]  and tell us the radio specials you've got for folks.
[02:55:13.360 --> 02:55:16.360]  And I know, again, you're running out of the previous stuff you bought a few weeks ago.
[02:55:16.360 --> 02:55:20.360]  It's going to go up, up, up, up, up. People better take advantage of this, Ted.
[02:55:20.360 --> 02:55:23.360]  Well, the whole entire industry right now, Alex, is short in supply.
[02:55:23.360 --> 02:55:29.360]  I mean, everybody's having trouble delivering Gold, and especially Silver.
[02:55:29.360 --> 02:55:33.360]  Right now, Gold hit a peak today of $1,490.
[02:55:33.360 --> 02:55:39.360]  Silver darn near breaking $30 an ounce again, $2,983 for the peak today.
[02:55:39.360 --> 02:55:45.360]  It's been a very, very actively trading day because the Fed right now is announcing
[02:55:45.360 --> 02:55:50.360]  that they're going to increase this QE2 thing from $600 billion to beyond.
[02:55:50.360 --> 02:55:52.360]  I don't know where the number is going to come out,
[02:55:52.360 --> 02:55:55.360]  but people in China right now are going into Gold and Silver because of it.
[02:55:55.360 --> 02:55:57.360]  And the same is true for Korea.
[02:55:57.360 --> 02:56:02.360]  Now, Korea is looking at Gold as one of the number one most best investments
[02:56:02.360 --> 02:56:05.360]  that anybody can get into in that country.
[02:56:05.360 --> 02:56:11.360]  It's like the entire Asian area, the Far East, is just looking over to the West
[02:56:11.360 --> 02:56:15.360]  and scratching their heads wondering how in the world long
[02:56:15.360 --> 02:56:18.360]  can the Federal Reserve system do what it does here
[02:56:18.360 --> 02:56:24.360]  and why is the West taking this cannibalistic suicide pill?
[02:56:24.360 --> 02:56:28.360]  And it baffles my mind, too. You're right about that, Alex.
[02:56:28.360 --> 02:56:30.360]  People really need to be getting into Silver,
[02:56:30.360 --> 02:56:35.360]  and there is no better way to get into Silver than getting your three videos,
[02:56:35.360 --> 02:56:39.360]  the Obama Deception Endgame, and follow the Republic.
[02:56:39.360 --> 02:56:41.360]  I mean, they're all in the plastic.
[02:56:41.360 --> 02:56:43.360]  I mean, I go to these events.
[02:56:43.360 --> 02:56:45.360]  No, it's three Silver half-dollars.
[02:56:45.360 --> 02:56:47.360]  I mean, three Silver full-dollars, excuse me,
[02:56:47.360 --> 02:56:50.360]  which everywhere is over $100 for three of them.
[02:56:50.360 --> 02:56:51.360]  I mean, it's amazing.
[02:56:51.360 --> 02:56:53.360]  Well, but that's just the thing, Alex.
[02:56:53.360 --> 02:56:54.360]  Three shipping and the three films.
[02:56:54.360 --> 02:56:56.360]  So it's $160 value for 97.
[02:56:56.360 --> 02:56:58.360]  But you know, I get these people that, you know,
[02:56:58.360 --> 02:57:00.360]  because I've been to these events.
[02:57:00.360 --> 02:57:01.360]  I mean, I've gone to the 9-11 events,
[02:57:01.360 --> 02:57:03.360]  and they're handing these things out to people
[02:57:03.360 --> 02:57:04.360]  because they want them to get them.
[02:57:04.360 --> 02:57:06.360]  But they're copies of the video.
[02:57:06.360 --> 02:57:09.360]  And these are like the original ones that are sealed in the plastic,
[02:57:09.360 --> 02:57:12.360]  brand-new covers, got all the descriptions,
[02:57:12.360 --> 02:57:13.360]  all the extras in there.
[02:57:13.360 --> 02:57:14.360]  And, you know, I...
[02:57:14.360 --> 02:57:16.360]  But a lot of folks already have that.
[02:57:16.360 --> 02:57:17.360]  I think it is the best deal ever.
[02:57:17.360 --> 02:57:20.360]  But, Ted, one of the specials you've got on Silver half-dollars,
[02:57:20.360 --> 02:57:23.360]  Silver dollars, fifth ounce gold, quarter ounce gold.
[02:57:23.360 --> 02:57:25.360]  I mean, fire out the radio specials for folks.
[02:57:25.360 --> 02:57:26.360]  Well, here we go.
[02:57:26.360 --> 02:57:29.360]  Walking Liberty halves are at 1363.
[02:57:29.360 --> 02:57:31.360]  The franc is at 1305.
[02:57:31.360 --> 02:57:33.360]  The British sovereign is at 1380.
[02:57:33.360 --> 02:57:36.360]  We have that survival bag we've been talking about.
[02:57:36.360 --> 02:57:42.360]  Do you realize that it takes 23 times as many dollars to buy one dime,
[02:57:42.360 --> 02:57:46.360]  or a silver coin, than it did back in 1964
[02:57:46.360 --> 02:57:50.360]  when we were using constitutional money here in the United States?
[02:57:50.360 --> 02:57:52.360]  23 times since 1964.
[02:57:52.360 --> 02:57:54.360]  I think there's a trend here.
[02:57:54.360 --> 02:57:57.360]  And I'm pretty sure we're reaching the end of the trend,
[02:57:57.360 --> 02:57:59.360]  because the United States dollar is doomed.
[02:57:59.360 --> 02:58:02.360]  Everybody in the entire world is looking at the United States dollar,
[02:58:02.360 --> 02:58:03.360]  and they're just going,
[02:58:03.360 --> 02:58:04.360]  man, I need to get away from it.
[02:58:04.360 --> 02:58:06.360]  Well, you've got a lot of other specials when you call.
[02:58:06.360 --> 02:58:07.360]  There's a long list, folks.
[02:58:07.360 --> 02:58:11.360]  You ask for the radio special prices from the Alex Jones show,
[02:58:11.360 --> 02:58:18.360]  800-686-2237-1800-686-2237.
[02:58:18.360 --> 02:58:21.360]  And, Ted, just briefly, what is a fifth of an ounce franc?
[02:58:21.360 --> 02:58:22.360]  How much is that right now?
[02:58:22.360 --> 02:58:25.360]  Well, the fifth of an ounce franc, that's the one that I was talking about.
[02:58:25.360 --> 02:58:27.360]  Currently, they're at 305 right now at this time.
[02:58:27.360 --> 02:58:29.360]  All right, 305.
[02:58:29.360 --> 02:58:31.360]  Again, that's a great deal.
[02:58:31.360 --> 02:58:34.360]  800-686-2237.
[02:58:34.360 --> 02:58:35.360]  Ted Anderson, thank you so much.
[02:58:35.360 --> 02:58:37.360]  I never heard Ted so excited.
[02:58:37.360 --> 02:58:53.360]  You heard him, everybody's running out, folks.
