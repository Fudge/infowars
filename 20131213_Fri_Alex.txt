[00:00.000 --> 00:13.640]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's Alex
[00:13.640 --> 00:33.440]  Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin, Texas Alex Jones Max Kaiser's
[00:33.440 --> 00:38.080]  coming on to talk about the world economy Bitcoin and more stuff on Malinu and our
[00:38.080 --> 00:44.560]  market capitalist is going to be popping in to give his take on the battle between collectivist
[00:44.560 --> 00:48.920]  and individuals and where he thinks it's all going and also cover some of the big world
[00:48.920 --> 00:53.080]  events with him we're going to have open phones as well interspersed with both guests today
[00:53.080 --> 01:01.800]  here on this live original 13th day of December 2013 and obviously I'm your host Alex Jones.
[01:01.800 --> 01:05.640]  Wow where to start I mean it's just every day I get frustrated because there's so much
[01:05.640 --> 01:10.840]  news I want to cover we're going to get to all of it guess who earned political facts
[01:10.840 --> 01:16.960]  top lie of 2013 and I agree this is probably the biggest lie of 2013 no not the lie of
[01:16.960 --> 01:21.640]  saying you can keep your health care plan and your prices won't go up but then saying
[01:21.640 --> 01:31.400]  he never said it and then saying no I meant you've you don't want to keep your doctor
[01:31.400 --> 01:39.120]  or if you do want to keep your doctor or after the bill goes into place and his law then
[01:39.120 --> 01:43.480]  you'll lose your doctor is what I meant but until then you won't lose your doctor I mean
[01:43.480 --> 01:48.520]  he said so many different things and they basically over a political fact say that it
[01:48.520 --> 01:55.360]  is one of the biggest lies they've ever seen calling it pants on fire level so there you
[01:55.360 --> 02:02.160]  go and Oprah Winfrey says because I don't like being lied to that I am a racist that's
[02:02.160 --> 02:11.400]  why people don't like Obama is because they are racist period I think Hitler or Stalin
[02:11.400 --> 02:14.880]  or Mao should have tried that but I guess they weren't as politically correct even
[02:14.880 --> 02:21.360]  in those authoritarian countries as we are it just makes being under oppression so fashionable
[02:21.360 --> 02:29.280]  so cool when Obama bombs a country so cool when he has the NSA spying on his political
[02:29.280 --> 02:34.640]  enemies are persecuting the press and again Obama himself is just a globalist manufactured
[02:34.640 --> 02:45.560]  frontman but still under Obama they've gotten away with more than any other American president
[02:45.560 --> 02:52.200]  we've ever seen and I can think of few cases in history where the out of control behavior
[02:52.200 --> 02:58.840]  has gotten this this bizarro so that's just some of what's coming up today the big news
[02:58.840 --> 03:04.040]  is obviously Chinese naval vessel tries to force US warship to stop at international
[03:04.040 --> 03:09.320]  waters that stories up on info wars dot com and prison planet dot com it's red linked
[03:09.320 --> 03:16.960]  on the right hand side of drudge report dot com there's another report out the bogus mandela
[03:16.960 --> 03:24.800]  singer faced a murder rap in 2003 and has other reported crimes and attempted crimes
[03:24.800 --> 03:29.240]  and charges in his in his background I could take one look at that guy in the television
[03:29.240 --> 03:33.880]  interviews that they've been airing on these obviously completely out of his mind bigger
[03:33.880 --> 03:37.480]  question is then how did he get up there on the stage and I know that's a distraction
[03:37.480 --> 03:43.680]  story it's not even that important but it's still just the marvel of how the government
[03:43.680 --> 03:48.840]  can't even get itself together but they have this projection with the jet airplanes and
[03:48.840 --> 03:54.920]  the red carpets and the Marines snapping to attention and the clicking flashing cameras
[03:54.920 --> 04:01.680]  that they are just invincible above the law godlike creatures and all of us are simply
[04:01.680 --> 04:08.620]  mere mortals while the rich and powerful live up in their ivory towers more and more extracting
[04:08.620 --> 04:15.440]  wealth through government combines not via the free market spain's public debt hits
[04:15.440 --> 04:20.320]  a record ninety three point four percent of GDP just like ours is going in that direction
[04:20.320 --> 04:24.560]  that's mission complete for the new world order UN confirms chemical arms were used repeatedly
[04:24.560 --> 04:30.480]  in Syria and the way this was phrased on the news last night and talk radio and TV was
[04:30.480 --> 04:35.280]  it proved Assad did it but they go on to admit that they don't know who did it well actually
[04:35.280 --> 04:39.440]  we do know who did it and we're going to break that down and Cy Hirsch knows who did it as
[04:39.440 --> 04:48.520]  well and it was the Al Qaeda forces who've been given part of western Iraq by our loving
[04:48.520 --> 04:53.520]  occupied government the criminals that run our government it's all coming up on the other
[04:53.520 --> 05:00.040]  side of this quick break stay with us I'm Alex Jones follow us on Twitter real Alex Jones

[05:10.440 --> 05:15.000]  my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico where the Chiapas farmers
[05:15.000 --> 05:19.960]  grow their unique shade grown Arabica beans we have now managed to secure the sought after
[05:19.960 --> 05:27.040]  beans in a highly customized blend discover and try a bag of the patriot blend 100% organic

[05:41.720 --> 05:46.480]  the Chiapas Mexican farmers dropped by the site today order a bag or two and I don't

[05:55.760 --> 06:02.120]  cup of my favorite coffee available at info wars life dot com in the last 50 years iodine

[06:07.760 --> 06:13.680]  now banned in nations around the world guess what else is in the halogen family fluoride
[06:13.680 --> 06:18.840]  ladies and gentlemen Alex Jones here in 1924 the federal government did the right thing
[06:18.840 --> 06:25.080]  and encouraged salt producers to add iodine it's the good halogen on the periodic table
[06:25.080 --> 06:32.040]  and the results are on record reports documented a 15 point IQ increase in areas that had previously
[06:32.040 --> 06:38.640]  been deficient in iodine bottom line iodine is important unbound clean in a glycerin base

[08:21.680 --> 08:29.080]  sale destination awakening final destination liberty thank you for joining us on this 13th
[08:29.080 --> 08:35.760]  today of December 2013 I am your host Alex Jones an archit capitalists and very interesting
[08:35.760 --> 08:41.800]  analyst Stefan Malinu will be joining us from the great white North Canada via video Skype
[08:41.800 --> 08:47.520]  and of course Max Kaiser the stockbroker economist analyst will talk about the big rumbles that's
[08:47.520 --> 08:53.440]  got mainline economists saying that they've now entered a false reality every market valuation
[08:53.440 --> 09:00.320]  has lost every anchor to the real world that's Reagan advisor kaiser's going to be joining
[09:00.320 --> 09:06.280]  us coming up in the second hour Stefan Malinu third hour and I'm going to take calls for
[09:06.280 --> 09:10.320]  each half hour with them for your questions and comments I really really love the questions
[09:10.320 --> 09:14.320]  and comments that folks bring up so we'll be open to the phones up when they're on with
[09:14.320 --> 09:20.080]  us where to start here's some of the headlines up on info wars dot com democrat debt victory
[09:20.080 --> 09:24.400]  and the decline of the tea party republicans you know I don't know if I agree with Nemo
[09:24.400 --> 09:28.440]  on that but it's certainly up for debate you can go in there and comment give us your take
[09:28.440 --> 09:33.680]  it just one up seconds ago zero comments on that top story there but it's definitely the
[09:33.680 --> 09:40.760]  decline of the rhino fake tea party democrats run by people like Carl Rove if you actually
[09:40.760 --> 09:44.720]  look at it through campaigns for liberty and Ron Paul and Rand Paul and Ted Cruz their
[09:44.720 --> 09:53.440]  popularity is more than ever and people are running at city state county federal races
[09:53.440 --> 10:01.360]  and winning and actually shooting down the Syria expansion of the war shooting down so
[10:01.360 --> 10:07.920]  many of the initiatives gun control restricting our second amendment I mean from that perspective
[10:07.920 --> 10:12.800]  I see what Kurt's saying but again I don't agree complete with all my writers we have
[10:12.800 --> 10:17.400]  some diversity of freedom based thought but but I do see his point that it's the decline
[10:17.400 --> 10:24.920]  of mainline fake tea party people but it is pretty disgusting Paul Ryan promenades with
[10:24.920 --> 10:31.720]  democrats as debt heads to the stratosphere and look at what's happening now they have
[10:31.720 --> 10:37.720]  this house budget deal for cuts that both parties dislike yeah but they already increased
[10:37.720 --> 10:43.120]  spending 60 something billion and they cut that so it's like they increase it and then
[10:43.120 --> 10:47.760]  they cut it like if I'm you know caught one of my kids in the fig newtons or something
[10:47.760 --> 10:51.400]  and they said and I you know I caught them eating like ten fig newtons before dinner
[10:51.400 --> 10:56.320]  and they had ten of them in their hands and I said you can't have any of those fig newtons
[10:56.320 --> 11:01.440]  till after dinner and then they go only five that's exactly the type of stuff that we're
[11:01.440 --> 11:07.800]  dealing with here and here's a headline out of Breitbart Spain's public debt hits record
[11:07.800 --> 11:16.160]  at 93.4% of GDP and that's current obligations not counting all the future obligations it's
[11:16.160 --> 11:24.640]  more like 200 plus percent of their GDP that's not sustainable in any universe and and that's
[11:24.640 --> 11:28.680]  where we're being maneuvered by these big offshore mega banks that run the new world
[11:28.680 --> 11:32.840]  order they want us bankrupted that's their plan so we're going to be breaking that down
[11:32.840 --> 11:42.480]  budget passed by house eases cuts both parties dislike and that is a accurate headline from
[11:42.480 --> 11:47.960]  drudge and that's a Bloomberg story because the truth is ladies and gentlemen they're
[11:47.960 --> 11:51.880]  not even talking about the QE unlimited by the Federal Reserve is devaluing all of our
[11:51.880 --> 11:55.200]  dollars that's why the stock market is so high even though it's been down this week
[11:55.200 --> 12:01.840]  a little bit is because they're chasing the stocks with devalued dollars and there's
[12:01.840 --> 12:05.960]  nowhere else to invest because you don't even get interest now at the bank on average that
[12:05.960 --> 12:10.640]  banks are talking about we've already done this in areas of Europe making you pay to
[12:10.640 --> 12:19.400]  have money in there that's called Weimar Republic type indicators but a congresswoman is complaining
[12:19.400 --> 12:26.400]  saying it's harder to recruit federal workers if they don't keep increasing their pay and
[12:26.400 --> 12:36.440]  if they don't keep expanding if they don't keep expanding basically the federal budget
[12:36.440 --> 12:40.960]  and and and then when they wreck the society their answer will be even more collectivism
[12:40.960 --> 12:45.880]  more taxes more control over the middle class and by the way Rahm Emanuel's brother the
[12:45.880 --> 12:52.280]  doctor Zeke Emanuel who helped write the Obamacare monstrosity admits on Fox Sunday
[12:52.280 --> 12:58.440]  months ago that the plans to get rid of the market where you can go out and get your own
[12:58.440 --> 13:03.440]  insurance and basically bring it into a socialist model with the big insurance companies on
[13:03.440 --> 13:09.520]  top getting the profits so they socialize all of our lives and socialize the debt so
[13:09.520 --> 13:14.600]  we all have to pay it but then privatize the profits offshore and so we knew they were
[13:14.600 --> 13:18.000]  bringing in death panels and now they admit it we knew they were planning to bankrupt
[13:18.000 --> 13:23.960]  the healthcare system further that's a classic socialist communist tactic and I want to explain
[13:23.960 --> 13:31.640]  something here we've got the LA Times here doing a profile for new listeners we're not
[13:31.640 --> 13:38.520]  saying this is a communist conspiracy we face or a socialist conspiracy it is a collectivist
[13:38.520 --> 13:43.920]  anti-liberty system for the general public with a tiny technocratic elite less than one
[13:43.920 --> 13:49.400]  tenth of one percent less than 6,000 top globalists in the superclass at the head of the Kissinger
[13:49.400 --> 13:53.760]  group Rothkopf talks about and I agree with his analysis he's pushing it as a good thing
[13:53.760 --> 13:58.880]  these people are largely exempt just like Congress is just like the EU bureaucrats are
[13:58.880 --> 14:05.920]  just like the French government are from the high taxes the 100% taxes on the middle class
[14:05.920 --> 14:12.400]  and the nouveau riche new wealthy in France is designed to destroy them as a class while
[14:12.400 --> 14:16.760]  transferring their wealth to the people that call themselves socialists who are really
[14:16.760 --> 14:22.000]  a bunch of knuckle dragon bank robin thugs who all have Swiss bank accounts on record
[14:22.000 --> 14:27.480]  for one year not paying the taxes and the head of the IMF is exempt from the EU wide
[14:27.480 --> 14:34.720]  taxes that she wants to be raised these are parasite criminals period they are our enemies
[14:34.720 --> 14:39.800]  and they're never going to stop and they're going to use the deindustrialization and
[14:39.800 --> 14:43.560]  the so-called service economy they're now shutting down oh first is going to be a service
[14:43.560 --> 14:46.480]  economy told you they were going to get rid of that they've done this in other countries
[14:46.480 --> 14:52.120]  to have you under full control so they dominate the future so they control the future so they
[14:52.120 --> 14:59.120]  run our lives they are eugenicist transhumanist delusional power tripping criminals who take
[14:59.120 --> 15:04.320]  our money and energy and ideas and get to play God and their reign of control freak
[15:04.320 --> 15:11.080]  garbage needs to come to an end now they are not going to give us quarter they are not
[15:11.080 --> 15:16.440]  going to back off they're not going to stop they are mentally ill psychopathic control
[15:16.440 --> 15:23.120]  freaks let me just do this I kind of went off onto a rampage about that I mean I use
[15:23.120 --> 15:26.520]  this example use it again Warren Buffett's the biggest recipient of the first round of
[15:26.520 --> 15:33.520]  banker bailout 40 something billion for Berkshire Hathaway in the first year of it of course
[15:33.520 --> 15:38.240]  he's lobbying to raise taxes ladies and gentlemen because he basically has had the laws written
[15:38.240 --> 15:44.120]  where his offshore subsidiaries are tax exempt now if you can't figure that out he's always
[15:44.120 --> 15:50.880]  on TV an ice cream cone always eating an ice cream cone it's a non-threatening thing just
[15:50.880 --> 15:54.200]  like somebody pulls up to kidnap your kids out of the backyard they go I got an ice cream
[15:54.200 --> 16:00.480]  cone I got a puppy evil doesn't come dressed like Adolf Hitler very often folks in a military
[16:00.480 --> 16:08.160]  uniform screaming and yelling evil comes all simpering and oh where to help you do what
[16:08.160 --> 16:17.240]  we say or Oprah Winfrey will call you a racist now is the time to face the reality we have
[16:17.240 --> 16:23.440]  been boarded by pirates using high-tech PR systems and they're backed up by paramilitary
[16:23.440 --> 16:28.000]  takeover system if we try to get out of line well the answer is have a full break with
[16:28.000 --> 16:33.120]  them and a full wake up to them and then there's nothing they can do to stop us if we start
[16:33.120 --> 16:38.600]  with drawing from their system only voting with our dollars with people and groups that
[16:38.600 --> 16:45.960]  promote liberty and literally literally focusing on them as the enemy and as the problem with
[16:45.960 --> 16:53.280]  absolute total hatred because they hate us folks now again we fight them because we love
[16:53.280 --> 16:59.520]  our family but when we see them there needs to be revulsion there needs to be an absolute
[16:59.520 --> 17:05.960]  there's Jeffrey Dahmer there's Hitler there's Stalin there's Mao these people are our enemies
[17:05.960 --> 17:11.160]  are declared enemies they are robbing us and destroying our republic and the only thing
[17:11.160 --> 17:18.560]  that's going to beat them is absolute revulsion and shunning as they deploy armored vehicles
[17:18.560 --> 17:24.200]  and drones against us and criminally spy on us and hire huge armies of control freak miscreants
[17:24.200 --> 17:29.240]  psychologically tested showing that their cowards want to dominate others they are building
[17:29.240 --> 17:39.360]  an army worthy of Mordor against us and we must rally against them I mean that's why
[17:39.360 --> 17:43.080]  I get so excited folks because I look at this stuff every day at night in the morning in
[17:43.080 --> 17:54.120]  the afternoon I'm living this stuff 16 17 18 hours a day I know how real it is let me

[24:58.600 --> 25:05.960]  politifacts top lie of 2013 uh-oh politifacts being racist oprah said each year politifact chooses
[25:05.960 --> 25:13.640]  the most egregious and misleading lie made by a us political figure with the top four all involving
[25:13.640 --> 25:20.520]  obama care it may surprise you who won the top spot oh no i'm not surprised at all if you like
[25:20.520 --> 25:24.840]  your healthcare you can keep your healthcare remember that quote president obama repeated
[25:24.840 --> 25:30.120]  numerous times yeah in the state of the union as well well that was bad enough it was far worse
[25:30.120 --> 25:34.920]  when he modified the lie inserting a disclaimer according to singin in first he said he never
[25:34.920 --> 25:40.200]  said it then they played it they said well what i meant was well he said was you could keep it
[25:40.200 --> 25:50.600]  if it hasn't changed since the law passed said obama and the politifact gave that the pants
[25:50.600 --> 25:54.600]  on fire and we played this already a bunch we're not going to play it again oprah told the bbc
[25:54.600 --> 26:01.480]  about three weeks ago that people are criticizing the lord the dear leader adolf hitler i mean
[26:01.480 --> 26:08.280]  barack obama uh kim jong-un himself the dear leader only makes the birds tweet the one that
[26:08.280 --> 26:12.360]  makes the businesses run if you have a business you didn't build it the dear leader that doubled
[26:12.360 --> 26:16.680]  and tripled your premiums and kicked you off your doctor plan and built the giant system so it would
[26:16.680 --> 26:20.440]  be a fraud and wouldn't work so they could claim it was a screwed job because it didn't work not
[26:20.440 --> 26:24.760]  because they screwed you see they oh it's an accident i told you that was coming i know all
[26:24.760 --> 26:29.320]  these criminals operate well now they admit it they go it's good it doesn't work we're going to ruin
[26:29.320 --> 26:34.840]  the whole system and go to pure kami care see they even admit it because they're criminals
[26:34.840 --> 26:39.080]  and they love to rub your nose in it and they're going to keep doing it because they know you love
[26:39.080 --> 26:46.120]  it so again obama is a victim of racism she said and they just have to die remember that video
[26:46.120 --> 26:53.560]  they just have to die i'm in fact i'm going to apologize in a truth and reconciliation
[26:53.560 --> 26:59.320]  commission to oprah it's i'm not mad at obama because he wants to take my guns or because
[26:59.320 --> 27:03.560]  he's offshoring our jobs or because he's totally selling us out the republican leadership
[27:03.560 --> 27:09.080]  and deindustrializing the nation i'm not mad at him that he wants to federalize all the schools
[27:09.080 --> 27:17.800]  and has msnbc openly say that my children belong to the state i'm not mad that it's ripping people
[27:17.800 --> 27:21.240]  off and shutting down the economy and wrecking health care in this country even worse with obama
[27:21.240 --> 27:26.360]  care by design i'm not mad at all that i'm mad because folks it is because he has light brown
[27:26.360 --> 27:32.200]  skin it very upsets me as deep racism and i need to i need to be killed i want to invite oprah
[27:32.200 --> 27:37.880]  wenfrey to come to austin texas and she can we'll build a guillotine for and she can pull the lever
[27:37.880 --> 27:43.800]  and chop my head off because i disagree with him and i think i i don't like him and she she is a
[27:43.800 --> 27:51.640]  goddess and when she speaks as a fountain of wisdom it's true and so she spoke ex cathedra
[27:51.640 --> 28:00.040]  from her throne and so that means it is written it is done and so all of us all of us who don't
[28:00.040 --> 28:07.320]  like anything obama does need to die first i'm being sarcastic uh oprah uh but um
[28:09.800 --> 28:13.240]  i actually don't want to die i actually want your horrible political ideas to die
[28:13.800 --> 28:19.880]  because we know oprah it's it's been leaked in the london guardian and the sunday times of london
[28:19.880 --> 28:24.120]  and the navy c news wrote a whitewash on it that you meet the secret eugenics meetings to push
[28:24.680 --> 28:28.840]  a alternate world government plan to forcefully reduce world population and we know what you
[28:28.840 --> 28:34.360]  push up on depopulation in africa and so that's why you call everyone a racist all day the truth
[28:34.360 --> 28:39.320]  is you as a multi-millionaire led into the elite halls and elite meetings with 10 or 12 people at
[28:39.320 --> 28:44.600]  them and way above bilderberg because you are such a traitor to humanity and such a traitor to black
[28:44.600 --> 28:50.840]  people and you are a pig in a disgusting fat demonic worm and i don't mean that because
[28:50.840 --> 28:54.840]  sometimes you balloon up and balloon down like a self-propelled stomach all of us have white
[28:54.840 --> 29:00.040]  problems really sometimes most of us do i mean you're spiritually an obese demon i mean you're
[29:00.040 --> 29:06.200]  just your sins are bloated and losing with the uh crimes you've committed and against humanity
[29:06.200 --> 29:11.080]  and the division you've showed and the con games giving women free cars knowing it'll make all the
[29:11.080 --> 29:16.520]  other welfare type folks and uh lottery ticket type people tune in believing they're going to get
[29:16.520 --> 29:22.840]  some type of free deal manipulating your audience in a cold-blooded calculated anti-human collectivist
[29:22.840 --> 29:30.520]  way and that's just what they hope for when free your ideas and people that think like you walk all
[29:30.520 --> 29:36.440]  over you are a scourge on this planet but i don't hope you die i hope you will prove yourself and
[29:36.440 --> 29:43.400]  repent before you're dropped headlong into the pit of hades into the frozen night circle of hell

[37:08.760 --> 37:13.880]  out but i had the tester bottles that i approved and just what it did stuff come out of my skin you
[37:13.880 --> 37:18.040]  name it i mean i still look like hell from all the stress i put my body through people can see on
[37:18.040 --> 37:23.960]  television the difference i mean people can see it so again just try it folks i'm not gonna even make
[37:23.960 --> 37:31.880]  claims here info wars life dot com no brag just fact you've heard the rave reviews or 8882533139
[37:31.880 --> 37:38.280]  but try the new fluoride shield it's in a two ounce bottle and is uh a lot more inexpensive for
[37:38.920 --> 37:43.320]  the amount you get than even the nascent iodine the pure nascent iodine okay i'm done plugging
[37:43.320 --> 37:47.560]  for this hour let me just recap if you just joined us some of the stuff we already covered
[37:47.560 --> 37:53.480]  and i'm gonna get into the big stacks i haven't hit yet we do have a max keiser coming up on the
[37:53.480 --> 37:59.240]  economy and we'll take your calls and then we have uh stefan malinu getting into world events
[37:59.240 --> 38:03.400]  always informative i've opened phones with him as well this is really the biggest news of the day
[38:03.400 --> 38:09.320]  and we've been talking a lot about this saying historically this is the type of stuff that starts
[38:09.320 --> 38:15.800]  major world wars and now it's being called a cuban missile crisis you know level uh situation
[38:16.440 --> 38:22.440]  in the uh areas in and around japan south korea and china there in the south china sea
[38:22.440 --> 38:29.000]  chinese naval vessel tries to force us warship stop international waters and that's uh bill
[38:29.000 --> 38:33.880]  dirts of course who also writes the washington times a chinese naval vessel tried to force a
[38:33.880 --> 38:39.000]  u.s guided missile warship to stop international waters recently causing a tense military
[38:39.000 --> 38:44.200]  standoff in the latest case of chinese maritime harassment according to defense officials as i
[38:44.200 --> 38:47.960]  haven't gotten dirts on years can we get bill dirts on about this or just about the whole situation
[38:47.960 --> 38:54.840]  he's got big cia contacts the guided missile cruiser uss copens which recently took part in
[38:54.840 --> 39:01.000]  disaster relief operation in the philippines from the monsoon from the typhoon was confronted by
[39:01.000 --> 39:07.240]  chinese warships in the south china sea here beijing's new aircraft carrier the lawing if i'm
[39:07.240 --> 39:10.760]  pronouncing that right according to officials familiar with the incident and basically we're
[39:10.760 --> 39:16.600]  going to ram them if they didn't get out of the way uh this is really becoming a big big big
[39:17.560 --> 39:21.720]  issue ladies and gentlemen now let's talk about what else is a big issue they love to
[39:21.720 --> 39:25.480]  fear monger about terrorism all day even though most of these al-qaeda groups have been funded
[39:25.480 --> 39:29.160]  by our government and others and that's now been declassified we're going to cover that in a moment
[39:30.040 --> 39:33.800]  but when you look at satellite photos now and i've seen documentaries on this
[39:33.800 --> 39:40.040]  the whole earth has giant impact points all over it like the moon but the moon doesn't have
[39:40.040 --> 39:46.200]  water doesn't have as much erosion doesn't have plants growing on it and animals running across it
[39:46.200 --> 39:51.560]  show you see all the impact points and we now know because of shoemaker levy the comet that
[39:51.560 --> 39:57.080]  crashed into one of the gas giants that these things come through all the a jupiter they don't
[39:57.080 --> 40:01.160]  come through every 50 million years like the people have just made up out of the air pulled out of
[40:01.160 --> 40:08.520]  the their their uh their obamas uh i was gonna say their butts but the point is i'm sorry i'm
[40:08.520 --> 40:15.560]  stupid attempts at humor now they know that these events are happening every couple hundred years
[40:16.280 --> 40:19.720]  now that they have the satellites to be able to gauge it and then go in and have archaeologists
[40:19.720 --> 40:26.760]  touch test the isotopes that are in the rock when these impacts happened and i've had uh
[40:26.760 --> 40:31.960]  uh levy of the shoemaker levy group on i've had a lot of these astronomers and scientists on
[40:33.240 --> 40:38.280]  and they now know that this is an event that happens a lot that's why a lot of civilizations
[40:38.920 --> 40:43.720]  they don't even know the names of and they can't read the writing of the stone tablets of were
[40:43.720 --> 40:49.400]  destroyed and then the few survivors tell the story of fire from the sky so this is the real
[40:49.400 --> 40:54.360]  type of threat and then you've got super volcanoes that they know are hundreds of all over the world
[40:54.360 --> 41:00.040]  that are still you know they call them dormant but they're really active and you've got anybody's
[41:00.040 --> 41:05.000]  been to yellowstone you see old faithful that's boiling water from the volcanic lava below the
[41:05.000 --> 41:11.640]  entire park is the cone of a sunken fallen in volcano in the last few years it's been incredibly
[41:11.640 --> 41:16.440]  active this is out of the new york post and my point is governments all got us worried about
[41:16.440 --> 41:23.000]  terrorists and stuff folks on a scale of you know one to a billion it doesn't even show up honeybees
[41:23.000 --> 41:27.800]  kill more people than terrorists every year look it up and i'm not saying this is going to blow up
[41:27.800 --> 41:33.320]  on us but but we know volcanoes erupt more often now than scientists previously said we don't know
[41:33.320 --> 41:37.800]  exactly how often it looks like pretty darn often you end up like people in pom pay but
[41:39.000 --> 41:43.240]  i've seen different numbers but let's just put it this way this volcano would have an explosion
[41:43.800 --> 41:47.720]  hundreds of times bigger than krakatoa or pom pay
[41:47.720 --> 41:52.600]  pom pay thousands of years ago krakatoa was what a hundred and something years ago
[41:53.160 --> 41:59.400]  the point is is that this is not a game this is not a joke hundreds of square miles is the size
[41:59.400 --> 42:04.360]  of the cone and the last time it blew up most of the country got covered with ash just to give
[42:04.360 --> 42:10.280]  me an idea and let me tell you this is a big deal i mean you got the chinese and the us and
[42:10.280 --> 42:17.080]  japan close to war you got all this crazy stuff going on and then you got this and i mean and now
[42:17.080 --> 42:23.640]  we know this stuff happens a lot more often than folks thought okay beneath yellowstone a volcano
[42:23.640 --> 42:29.320]  that could wipe out the us it's the awe-inspiring pride of the united states and it harbors a
[42:29.320 --> 42:35.400]  deadly power that could kill us all yellowstone national park is pristine wilderness full of
[42:35.400 --> 42:39.000]  scenic landscapes that's it i'm going up there it's a good excuse to go on a road trip with
[42:39.000 --> 42:44.920]  the kids and iconic hot pools and geysers that attract tens of thousands of visitors every year
[42:44.920 --> 42:50.760]  but it's what lies beneath that has scientists scattering that's a good way to describe it
[42:50.760 --> 42:54.040]  i'm glad somebody cares and we've we've had some of these scientists on over the years
[42:54.840 --> 42:59.800]  we've long known that yellowstone is merely the skin top of a super volcano a giant pool of magma
[42:59.800 --> 43:04.280]  sitting just under the earth's surface exactly how giant has been the subject of much speculation
[43:04.280 --> 43:11.080]  until now dun dun dun a team from the university of utah i want them on guys i want them on this
[43:11.080 --> 43:17.080]  show next week please please of utah i've told the american geological union fall meeting in san
[43:17.080 --> 43:23.080]  francisco that yellowstone's magma chamber is 2.5 times larger than previously thought
[43:24.600 --> 43:31.160]  it is the underground cavern measuring some 55 miles by 20 miles and contain between 125 and
[43:31.160 --> 43:40.440]  185 billion cubic miles of molten rock 185 billion my oh i'm so scared of al-qaeda now
[43:40.440 --> 43:43.800]  i'm glad they've got armored vehicles on every street corner for us folks
[43:44.840 --> 43:52.280]  and that's what always it's like the song godzilla uh by uh blue oyster cult god god godzilla
[43:52.280 --> 43:57.880]  that's a metaphor for the earth i mean just i mean don't you just wish one of these would
[43:57.880 --> 44:02.200]  go off in dc sometimes i mean i'm big sarcastic i actually don't wish that because rand paul's up
[44:02.200 --> 44:10.440]  there but the point is this is a big deal if it blows it will wipe out america yeah that's what
[44:10.440 --> 44:14.840]  the scientists have said here before and have enormous impacts on the rest of the world maybe
[44:14.840 --> 44:19.000]  we could have the tsa go out there and just frisk people and that would make us safe the university
[44:19.000 --> 44:23.960]  researchers described their discovery as astounding and really researchers are fighting the same
[44:23.960 --> 44:27.560]  thing this is what they've been saying for a decade as it's been heating up to see they used to think
[44:27.560 --> 44:32.920]  oh it goes off every few million years now they know it's rising and lowering much faster and
[44:32.920 --> 44:37.800]  showing evidence it could explode anytime anytime and i'm not saying that's gonna happen
[44:39.000 --> 44:42.360]  because they don't have a lot of super volcanoes to study they have a lot of regular different
[44:42.360 --> 44:48.680]  of the three types really four types but they're they're leaning towards that it it's gonna it's
[44:48.680 --> 44:54.840]  gonna blow up is it 10 years 20 years 100 now nobody knows round and round she goes where it
[44:54.840 --> 45:03.640]  stops nobody knows yeah that's right you in fact um cj just popped my report that they're saying
[45:03.640 --> 45:09.080]  it's overdue but i'm trying to be conservative here they'll have singing in announced that i claim
[45:09.080 --> 45:15.080]  that obama is going to blow up a volcano you know a woman called in and said i think weather
[45:15.080 --> 45:18.920]  weapons could have made the tornadoes hit oh i'm sitting i said well they do have weather weapons
[45:18.920 --> 45:25.400]  but this probably isn't that and they turn that into alex jones says obama sent the tornadoes lying
[45:25.400 --> 45:29.400]  to their victim audience so so i'm not saying it's overdue even though the scientists say that
[45:29.960 --> 45:35.160]  and i didn't make the volcano they'll say jones claims that there's a spaceship under the un
[45:35.160 --> 45:39.320]  building that's rachel madel he said that okay continuing i mean she said that
[45:41.400 --> 45:45.320]  the research is part of an ongoing effort to assess the true threat of the molten
[45:45.320 --> 45:53.160]  beast represents what is a super volcano yeah and then they say eruption do in this article
[45:53.160 --> 45:56.920]  from analysis of rock and sediment layers scientists say another eruption is almost two
[45:57.560 --> 46:01.400]  and that's why there's different views because they all vary and debate it at least by geological
[46:01.400 --> 46:06.120]  standards it appears the super volcano explodes roughly every 700 000 years they don't know
[46:06.680 --> 46:11.320]  three such eruptions are known one was 2.1 million years ago another 1.3 million years ago
[46:11.320 --> 46:16.440]  because again they consider the isotopes the most recent was 640 000 years ago but here's
[46:16.440 --> 46:19.080]  what the scientists have told me and i haven't read this little articles i don't know they
[46:19.080 --> 46:22.680]  cover it here because i keep talking about it in the next page covers what i already
[46:22.680 --> 46:29.320]  had said before because we've had the scientists on is that is that when you look at these things
[46:31.160 --> 46:37.000]  they think there's like hiccups which are you know 20 30 40 50 times the size of amount saint
[46:37.000 --> 46:42.760]  helens so the big eruptions are having you know you're happening over 100 000 years but then it
[46:42.760 --> 46:49.240]  kind of has hiccups and a hiccup they think will destroy the four state area around there so
[46:50.040 --> 46:54.120]  better pray and and hope there's a god above folks so what would happen if yellowstone was
[46:54.120 --> 46:58.760]  erupt something close to armageddon he goes on to say in the new york post soil samples were
[46:58.760 --> 47:03.160]  real the last time it happened the whole north america was smothered by ash okay i've already
[47:03.160 --> 47:08.600]  covered all this see i've already studied this because i'm worried about it because i'm an extremist
[47:09.320 --> 47:15.880]  okay uh let's um let's go another very interesting article here in the science and tech area
[47:16.600 --> 47:22.040]  physicists discover clearest evidence yet that the universe is a hologram they're finding in
[47:22.040 --> 47:29.000]  scientific mapping that there's some type of wavelength system british scientists found
[47:29.000 --> 47:33.720]  this last year this is japanese scientists this time holding everything together and like an outside
[47:33.720 --> 47:41.560]  projection so a universe we outside the universe containing this verse and of course that's a
[47:41.560 --> 47:50.920]  multiverse that theories of max plank and uh many other quantum mechanics uh technicians of their time
[47:52.200 --> 47:58.200]  of course the most famous of them einstein simultaneous backup there the universe is a
[47:58.200 --> 48:05.400]  hologram there it is out of the journal of nature and black holes are just fissures between those so
[48:06.280 --> 48:10.280]  yeah you know that's really the greatest crime of the globalist is that we spend all our time
[48:10.280 --> 48:17.000]  obsessed with them when they really don't even matter and are just idiots oh here's another one
[48:17.000 --> 48:22.600]  you know they're coming out with cia run press bots that write fake news stories that are given the
[48:22.600 --> 48:27.880]  data or press releases this is out of news feed meet the robot telemarketer who denies
[48:27.880 --> 48:32.920]  she's a robot yeah no i've gotten calls from these for years i talked about this about two
[48:32.920 --> 48:38.040]  years ago where i was arguing i was calling information because i was driving hands free
[48:38.040 --> 48:41.880]  and didn't want to be surfing while i was driving and i said no i want to talk to the operator and
[48:41.880 --> 48:46.440]  they go this is the operator so this is a robot and it started arguing with me and then i said
[48:46.440 --> 48:52.040]  that's it operator operator for like a minute and then a woman came on so i've already had
[48:52.040 --> 48:56.600]  arguments and i guarantee you i was part of some beta test because i tried it again it never happened
[48:56.600 --> 49:02.440]  but where they were testing this out the phone call came from a charming woman with bright
[49:02.440 --> 49:07.880]  engaging voice to the cell phone of a time washington bureau chief michael shearer she
[49:07.880 --> 49:13.400]  wanted to offer a deal on health insurance but something was fishy it's now coming out that
[49:13.400 --> 49:17.720]  they're actually giving your data to telemarketers and people when you do sign up for obama cure
[49:17.720 --> 49:22.520]  we already knew that but that's coming out now so uh there you go
[49:22.520 --> 49:28.920]  um here's another one uh lawmakers who oversee government surveillance programs
[49:28.920 --> 49:33.960]  receive millions from intelligence companies set to make billions off of raping our privacy
[49:34.520 --> 49:40.760]  isn't that just sweet that's out of the capital city project very important just to always
[49:41.400 --> 49:45.720]  point that out i have some other science news it's really interesting i haven't uh
[49:45.720 --> 49:49.160]  haven't gotten to yet but we're going to come back go to your phone calls this segment the next
[49:49.160 --> 49:54.360]  then max keiser eight after is going to join us and then i want to talk about uh u n confirms
[49:54.360 --> 49:59.400]  chemical arms were used repeatedly in syria and then about seven paragraphs in let me see one two
[49:59.400 --> 50:06.280]  three four five six seven paragraphs in they uh say no one knows who really did it well that's
[50:06.280 --> 50:10.680]  actually not true si hersher and others have now confirmed we first documented off the al-qaeda
[50:10.680 --> 50:15.480]  official channels that are their channels launching the chemical attacks and singing love songs have
[50:15.480 --> 50:21.720]  been lauding it's so goofy they weren't so deadly insiders reveal obama framed Assad for chemical
[50:21.720 --> 50:27.560]  weapons attack western journalism center uh so we've got all that that's coming up and then we've
[50:27.560 --> 50:34.520]  got another fraud i heard a talk show host on w o a i last night this happened to dial through things
[50:35.320 --> 50:39.880]  and they were saying yeah people said that hijackers couldn't use cell phones in 9 11
[50:39.880 --> 50:46.360]  well they've been proven wrong now and people couldn't make calls because now the f a a is working with
[50:46.360 --> 50:52.120]  the uh FCC and others to allow it that's when your phone like on a cruise ship gets jacked into
[50:52.120 --> 50:56.760]  their system and charges you five dollars by the minute it's working off an antenna on the bottom
[50:56.760 --> 51:02.680]  your cell phone doesn't work above three thousand feet try it by now you may know that a bitcoin
[51:02.680 --> 51:07.560]  is the first decentralized currency that's easily transferred from person to person over the internet

[55:09.320 --> 55:13.800]  they're all incredible but when we found it found it online there's a parody video with it but it
[55:13.800 --> 55:18.680]  but it is the drug ad because i heard it on the radio for basically one of these speed drugs
[55:18.680 --> 55:23.080]  they're trying to get the public on number one drink now is the one hour energy and stuff that's
[55:23.800 --> 55:29.080]  you know not dangerous i would say on average compared to the pharmaceutical stuff but whatever

[55:33.640 --> 55:38.920]  three jobs and now they want to put people on stuff that basically the military uses folks if you
[55:38.920 --> 55:43.400]  know what speed does it makes people go crazy and of course when there's more mental illness and more
[55:43.400 --> 55:48.840]  insanity because a big pharma their answer will be take our guns take our rights because other people

[56:14.920 --> 56:23.640]  touch on a few things uh recently we had the jfk 50th anniversary and we don't talk much about
[56:24.280 --> 56:30.200]  about us going to the moon and i know multiple people that worked at nasa who were good friends
[56:30.200 --> 56:35.240]  of mine one of them is dead raymond digg had a few months ago who were running you know cameras on
[56:35.240 --> 56:40.360]  the moon and were there at mission control i can watch the film see them there in houston and they
[56:40.360 --> 56:48.600]  say we went to the moon and you believe that i've known raymond digg for 15 years and he's one of
[56:48.600 --> 56:54.360]  the sweetest people i ever know and and he was the real deal and didn't didn't lie about it he said
[56:54.360 --> 56:58.920]  they would have to have a whole fake mission in orbit to fool them but they saw the distance the
[56:58.920 --> 57:03.800]  time for the radio signals to get there he said that there was clearly some fake pr photos and
[57:03.800 --> 57:09.720]  stuff put out they believe uh so that people could you know see some pr production but i've talked to
[57:09.720 --> 57:14.120]  stanley cubrick's daughter you name it he wasn't involved in it people just make that up and say
[57:14.120 --> 57:19.880]  it with no proof uh i mean look i i just document what i can document i don't think it really matters
[57:19.880 --> 57:25.240]  at this point we know they've they've hoaxed a lot of stuff but uh go ahead and make your point about
[57:25.240 --> 57:32.040]  it well i mean there's a few videos on youtube sure you heard you've seen and even fox uh put out
[57:32.040 --> 57:37.080]  a special about how the moon landing could have been a hope now i'm not saying we did not go to the
[57:37.080 --> 57:43.640]  moon i'm just saying the way they put it out is not the way i believe we went to the moon that's
[57:43.640 --> 57:48.840]  actually what i was told by dr bob bowman who's dead now the former head of the star wars program
[57:48.840 --> 57:53.320]  but he wouldn't talk about it he said it was classified i mean that's the deal i mean look

[01:03:13.320 --> 01:03:21.480]  that's a way to get our minds around this and i mean it's crazy i mean you know you you talk
[01:03:21.480 --> 01:03:30.040]  about how they torture people's kids in front of them at black bases dark bases secret bases
[01:03:30.040 --> 01:03:35.480]  ghost bases all over the world and it's because they like to and then they bragging the news
[01:03:35.480 --> 01:03:41.000]  to introduce it there many times like yeah we uh we brought their kids in and did some stuff and
[01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:44.840]  they answered the questions about where al-qaeda was at that's all just made up they're just telling
[01:03:44.840 --> 01:03:49.400]  you they did that to introduce it into your mind like a virus that torturing a kid's a good thing
[01:03:49.400 --> 01:03:54.520]  and all these sitcoms and dramas and and and movies in england and germany and the u.s and 24 all
[01:03:54.520 --> 01:03:59.880]  those shows how many plots you can look them up where they torture kids before 9 11 i was reading
[01:03:59.880 --> 01:04:04.520]  a law enforcement magazine i think it was swat magazine and it was a terrorist he's going to
[01:04:04.520 --> 01:04:10.120]  release something like 20 anthrax bombs you can go look it up i remember the exact number
[01:04:10.120 --> 01:04:14.440]  he's going to detonate him it's going to kill thousands unless you torture his 12 year old son
[01:04:15.560 --> 01:04:18.280]  and then the article went on to say go ahead and torturing
[01:04:20.360 --> 01:04:26.760]  you're going to save people and they were infecting the cops minds and again i was at a 7 11
[01:04:26.760 --> 01:04:32.600]  grab the magazine randomly don't read those cop magazines very often opened it up and it was how
[01:04:32.600 --> 01:04:37.000]  to torture a 12 year old boy in front of daddy when a militia guy is going to release anthrax
[01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:41.400]  now about a year and a half later the globalist launched 9 11 and launched the anthrax it's all
[01:04:41.400 --> 01:04:46.200]  just pre-programming pre-programming and the cops are all reading this and it's just turning them

[01:09:01.480 --> 01:09:05.640]  by the way we got an article going up soon info wars.com with a bunch of the bombshell quotes
[01:09:05.640 --> 01:09:11.000]  from former congressman ron paul where he talked about how he had trailblazed the path for his son
[01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:17.560]  to run for president and now he's now wrapped his mind around the idea of rand of becoming president
[01:09:17.560 --> 01:09:22.920]  and and helping to restore the republic but he covered a whole bunch of other issues on the economy
[01:09:22.920 --> 01:09:28.920]  how it's doomed to implode by design under fiat banking was just i think the best interview
[01:09:28.920 --> 01:09:35.480]  i've ever done with ron paul and i'm on his show by the way monday and we'll be posting at info wars.com
[01:09:36.360 --> 01:09:42.680]  but ron paul interview will be posted with the video the next hour at info wars.com paul
[01:09:42.680 --> 01:09:49.960]  watson wrote an article this morning white house front group vows to target alternative media and
[01:09:49.960 --> 01:09:56.200]  i don't cover what media matters does because they're a powerful group i cover them because
[01:09:56.200 --> 01:10:03.640]  they're such an anti-american group and such a window into the open treason and open manipulation
[01:10:03.640 --> 01:10:08.920]  of the media that's going on the white house brags and media matters brags they have weekly
[01:10:08.920 --> 01:10:13.800]  meetings they have a bunch of former white house officials that run it that that run media matters
[01:10:13.800 --> 01:10:18.120]  and the reason it matters is not that their website that no one hardly visits no one even
[01:10:18.120 --> 01:10:22.280]  listens to their laughing stock a joke they got a bunch of trendies you know where you know wearing
[01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:27.560]  miscolored socks on there as camouflage to make themselves look non-threatening
[01:10:28.120 --> 01:10:32.840]  they're actually a psi op core on record and the head of it packs heat and is all paranoid but
[01:10:32.840 --> 01:10:37.560]  doesn't want you to be able to own guns i mean it's classic i'm talking about david brock of
[01:10:37.560 --> 01:10:42.760]  course these are not liberals these are authoritarians and the reason this story is important and

[01:10:47.320 --> 01:10:51.080]  could be cairo it could be russia it could be england could be the u.s i'll ask him where he's
[01:10:51.080 --> 01:10:55.160]  at when he comes on with us in a minute the reason i mentioned this is i co-wrote this
[01:10:55.160 --> 01:11:00.360]  article this morning with with paul watson it's got some quotes by me in there white house front
[01:11:00.360 --> 01:11:04.520]  group vows to target alternative media well the memo came out three years ago that they would
[01:11:04.520 --> 01:11:12.440]  actually get jobs in the media to sabotage them from within so it's a paramilitary group basically
[01:11:12.440 --> 01:11:20.520]  uh and they go on to say media matters set to intensify attacks against drudge in full wars
[01:11:21.560 --> 01:11:25.960]  in concert with obama advisors they've had the pentagon come out and freak out over drudge
[01:11:25.960 --> 01:11:30.600]  report dot com and they're freaked out over worldnet daily dot com and in full wars dot com over
[01:11:30.600 --> 01:11:35.160]  anybody who aren't just total authoritarians it's not about left or right it's about not being an
[01:11:35.160 --> 01:11:40.520]  authoritarian because we're hurting them so bad now they delusion only claim victory over fox news
[01:11:40.520 --> 01:11:45.160]  who's full of its own brands of propaganda and say they've defeated them with george soros who funds
[01:11:45.160 --> 01:11:51.560]  them fox news is bigger than ever cnn msnbc are imploding but the reason this is so important
[01:11:52.440 --> 01:11:57.720]  is that i've seen it before they even admitted it in the last few years where they'll be an attack
[01:11:57.720 --> 01:12:06.440]  on media matters and then word for word on cnn or msnbc it comes out and now they brag to the
[01:12:06.440 --> 01:12:13.800]  huffington post and that's linked here that they indeed do run cnn and msnbc now now why doesn't
[01:12:13.800 --> 01:12:17.640]  the white house just send it over well that's so illegal especially when they're getting stimulus
[01:12:17.640 --> 01:12:21.640]  money and msnbc and other things and their parent companies are getting bailout money it's already
[01:12:21.640 --> 01:12:27.240]  so illegal it's still illegal what they're doing clearly or into federal and state law in just common
[01:12:27.240 --> 01:12:33.240]  sense that they have to have this pass-through group of interns basically that the white house
[01:12:33.240 --> 01:12:38.440]  they have weekly meetings passes them the talking point and emails them daily the talking point
[01:12:38.440 --> 01:12:44.200]  and so you can tell who they're upset about drudgereport.com info wars.com they run around like
[01:12:44.200 --> 01:12:51.480]  chickens with their heads cut off on a daily basis bleeding out politically they literally
[01:12:51.480 --> 01:12:57.960]  are chickens with their heads cut off because a chicken with its head cut off really does run
[01:12:57.960 --> 01:13:02.040]  around with blood spurting till they pump out and then they fall over dead but a chicken can run
[01:13:02.040 --> 01:13:06.680]  around for several minutes and they are or if you've ever worked as an exterminator i did this
[01:13:06.680 --> 01:13:12.200]  for just a few months maybe feel too bad i quit doing it obviously one summer i worked on the
[01:13:12.200 --> 01:13:16.520]  ranch and the next summer they had been working as an exterminator point is when you spray a
[01:13:16.520 --> 01:13:22.600]  bunch of roaches down under a house in a crawl space they start having sex and that's basically
[01:13:22.600 --> 01:13:26.680]  what these people are doing they're just running around declaring victory rearranging deck chairs
[01:13:26.680 --> 01:13:32.840]  polishing silverware throwing each other you know politically on the table and humping each other
[01:13:32.840 --> 01:13:38.280]  i mean this is basically what's going on declaring delusional victory it's like hitler in the bunker
[01:13:38.280 --> 01:13:43.320]  commanding armies that didn't exist and they've now declared victory over fox that's like like
[01:13:43.320 --> 01:13:50.280]  they've declared victory over the sun or something totally out of their power and but this is the
[01:13:50.280 --> 01:13:54.520]  white house this is directly the white house that doesn't want to look pathetic and weird
[01:13:54.520 --> 01:13:59.080]  countering us so they have this this little chicken running around bleeding out doing it but
[01:13:59.080 --> 01:14:04.440]  it's literally like a mars rover of the white house and it's and they're listening right now
[01:14:04.440 --> 01:14:08.360]  they admit they're listening they write articles about us every week i mean what up it is a badge
[01:14:08.360 --> 01:14:14.280]  of honor you twits it's like the brady campaign came out and said ban all the guns alabama gets
[01:14:14.280 --> 01:14:17.880]  a failing score for not banning them yeah they got a low crime rate compared to places that have
[01:14:17.880 --> 01:14:23.880]  banned the guns it's a badge of honor you don't control reality you don't dictate oprah went
[01:14:23.880 --> 01:14:29.800]  oprah went free doesn't call people racist that don't like obama care go to haiti's oprah don't
[01:14:29.800 --> 01:14:36.440]  play your race card you race pimp we're all in a rebellion against the banksters left right center
[01:14:36.440 --> 01:14:42.440]  we don't care we want freedom we want currency freedom we want individual freedom we want travel
[01:14:42.440 --> 01:14:47.480]  freedom and we know what's happening and now joining us for the rest of the hour very honored
[01:14:47.480 --> 01:14:52.520]  to have him join us always extremely informative max keiser dot com is his site to find all things
[01:14:52.520 --> 01:14:57.800]  max keiser he's a filmmaker broadcaster and a former broker and options trader he invented the
[01:14:57.800 --> 01:15:02.520]  hollywood stock exchange by counter and Fitzgerald that ended up being the model of many of the
[01:15:02.520 --> 01:15:09.800]  virtual trading systems adopted today and he's got shows on rt bbc the list just goes on and on i
[01:15:09.800 --> 01:15:16.600]  want to get his take on faber all the big economist rogers that just keep being right saying what he's
[01:15:16.600 --> 01:15:22.120]  been saying this next year is the big one we're already in a global recession slash depression
[01:15:22.120 --> 01:15:26.680]  depending on where you are and the qe unlimited screwing things up if they cut it off it's going
[01:15:26.680 --> 01:15:31.480]  to blow up uh max predict what happened to bond market now in the stock market i want to get
[01:15:31.480 --> 01:15:35.400]  his take on all that then we'll look at bitcoin cryptocurrencies then we'll look at a bunch of
[01:15:35.400 --> 01:15:41.880]  other news and take your phone calls but max keiser the man that coined the term uh the casino
[01:15:41.880 --> 01:15:47.560]  gulag economy which really i think aptly describes where we're going joins us now max keiser thank
[01:15:47.560 --> 01:15:55.720]  you so much for coming on where are you right now i'm in london i'm in london in the uk where
[01:15:55.720 --> 01:16:01.800]  there's a what we're having here now is the chinese people are buying up london and uh
[01:16:01.800 --> 01:16:07.320]  they're moving in they're buying the purchases of assets in london by the chinese skyrocketing
[01:16:07.960 --> 01:16:13.880]  and the government here in the uk including the mayor of london boris johnson is over
[01:16:13.880 --> 01:16:21.160]  in china selling uh london to the chinese and billions and billions are pouring into this
[01:16:21.160 --> 01:16:27.000]  town from the chinese because the chinese government is printing 200 billion dollars a
[01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:31.560]  month in quantitative easing you know in the united states they do 85 billion a month at the federal
[01:16:31.560 --> 01:16:36.920]  reserve people are aghast at how much money they're printing every month and of course that's why you
[01:16:36.920 --> 01:16:45.720]  have this asset price explosion and things like art and diamonds and other assets well in china
[01:16:45.720 --> 01:16:50.360]  they're printing 200 billion a month and they're taking all that money and they're buying real
[01:16:50.360 --> 01:16:55.800]  estate in london and of course the people who live here can't afford to live here anymore so you see
[01:16:55.800 --> 01:17:01.960]  now people are moving into containers you know the containers on a container ship they're stacking
[01:17:01.960 --> 01:17:08.760]  those up and people are moving into those as a container ship container so literally the fiat
[01:17:08.760 --> 01:17:15.000]  money selectively being pumped out by governments to build new high rises for themselves are then
[01:17:16.280 --> 01:17:20.520]  driving up the price of everything else for everyone else so it's a selective inflation
[01:17:20.520 --> 01:17:26.840]  but it's starting to spill over yeah it's a it's asset price inflation from all that free money
[01:17:26.840 --> 01:17:35.560]  printing to keep the the zombie banks alive but somehow it never it never makes it into the economy
[01:17:35.560 --> 01:17:41.720]  in terms of rising or raising wages so here in the uk again as an example wages are growing
[01:17:41.720 --> 01:17:46.600]  at less than one percent a year and meanwhile the understated inflation right by the government they
[01:17:46.600 --> 01:17:51.320]  say it's a 2.8 percent a year but if you ask what is the goal of the technocrats to lower wages while
[01:17:51.320 --> 01:17:55.720]  increasing prices drive everyone into total submission create social disorder then bring in
[01:17:55.720 --> 01:18:01.800]  police that is the answer that was the leaked world bank plan 2002 well i mean if you were in
[01:18:01.800 --> 01:18:07.000]  their position you would do the same thing you would print lots of money and then make sure that
[01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:14.200]  instead of having it flow to every part of the economy causing inflation throughout the economy
[01:18:14.200 --> 01:18:21.000]  if you could direct it to just those assets that you own like art high diamonds or minerals and
[01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:25.400]  things like that then you've got the best of both worlds you've got you've got your little private
[01:18:25.400 --> 01:18:30.360]  bank the essential banks printing money and you pocket all that free cash and you keep your zombie
[01:18:30.360 --> 01:18:34.760]  bank alive and the zombie bank of course is laundering all your drug money that just came out
[01:18:34.760 --> 01:18:40.840]  again that uh the uk banks are involved in billions of dollars of laundering mexican drug money and
[01:18:40.840 --> 01:18:44.840]  they need cheap money to do that they need to be able to hide that money and to move that money
[01:18:44.840 --> 01:18:52.920]  around cheaply and uh so this is the game and the the the loss of living standards here in the uk
[01:18:52.920 --> 01:18:59.560]  is as sharp as it's been since the victorian era living standards here in the uk are collapsing
[01:19:02.200 --> 01:19:06.200]  i want to get into all these different stories and factoids that you're bringing up and what's
[01:19:06.200 --> 01:19:10.280]  happening geopolitically with russia threatening to nuke europe if they continue to move weapon
[01:19:10.280 --> 01:19:15.400]  systems in against their borders what's happening in china i mean these are the times historically
[01:19:15.400 --> 01:19:21.000]  world war one world war two uh studying history the last time the world acted like this the last
[01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:27.080]  time there was this type of economic mismanagement going on uh things basically imploded max keiser
[01:19:27.080 --> 01:19:32.760]  give us the big picture before you zoom in to the you know localized stories uh break down
[01:19:33.320 --> 01:19:38.600]  what you see happening in the bond market stock markets uh i'm starting to see more and more inflation
[01:19:38.600 --> 01:19:43.080]  even if they try to contain it and only give themselves the wealth what do you see happening
[01:19:44.600 --> 01:19:49.240]  well i think there's a couple of obvious hotspots one would be in the north pole region where
[01:19:49.240 --> 01:19:53.960]  canada just last week decided that they own the north pole russia is very active in the north pole
[01:19:53.960 --> 01:19:58.120]  they've both declared they're gonna have a race they're both claiming that this week that they
[01:19:58.120 --> 01:20:03.480]  they own it now right norway is also making claims so the north pole is becoming a hot zone
[01:20:03.480 --> 01:20:08.040]  china and russia are now actively engaged in in a hot war you know we talked about this on your show
[01:20:08.760 --> 01:20:14.840]  nine months ago and at that time it seemed a bit far-fetched but now you've got really things
[01:20:14.840 --> 01:20:20.920]  heating up china and japan excuse me uh so they they're at they're they're seemingly ready to
[01:20:20.920 --> 01:20:25.960]  to start firing shots at each other and i think it all goes back to what we've been talking about
[01:20:25.960 --> 01:20:30.440]  on your show for a number of years now which is that the bond market has been going up for 30 years
[01:20:31.160 --> 01:20:37.160]  starting with really go back to reagan and thatcher who brought about the whole era of deregulation
[01:20:37.160 --> 01:20:43.720]  and derivatives which allowed for this enormous 30-year bull market in bonds which is now coming
[01:20:43.720 --> 01:20:49.400]  to an end that means that the era of cheap money or cheap credit is coming to an end so now instead
[01:20:49.400 --> 01:20:54.760]  of just using financial instruments to gain property and treasure we're going back to the old
[01:20:54.760 --> 01:21:00.040]  tried-and-true war you know war is the old way of getting well that was my next question they're
[01:21:00.040 --> 01:21:05.400]  now announcing in the u.s europe england the bail in the new form of taxation where they just take
[01:21:05.400 --> 01:21:09.640]  the money directly out of your account and give it to private interest or they take your national
[01:21:09.640 --> 01:21:13.960]  park and give it to a private interest even though the private interest is the one that's in debt
[01:21:13.960 --> 01:21:19.160]  they've just gotten the government to sign on to their debt uh absolutely amazing in fact here's
[01:21:19.160 --> 01:21:26.760]  curtain m o's uh headline uh on it uh breaking it down up on info wars dot com imf wants 71
[01:21:26.760 --> 01:21:33.880]  percent tax rate uh and it says old-fashioned taxation is out expect outright grand larceny
[01:21:33.880 --> 01:21:38.520]  at the local enforcement by government and they actually say in all these white papers what you've
[01:21:38.520 --> 01:21:43.480]  talked about they're going to impoverish us so we're literally starving living in in shacks like
[01:21:43.480 --> 01:21:50.200]  mexico city and then they're going to be behind big fences in huge armored ground-based elysiums
[01:21:50.200 --> 01:21:56.360]  literal greek elysiums or the golden fields of the gods or the chosen humans brought up to be gods
[01:21:56.360 --> 01:22:01.480]  is really what elysium really is and then they're behind i mean it's literally the hunger games
[01:22:02.920 --> 01:22:07.720]  yeah well it's back to medievalism and that's the way it was for hundreds of years the only thing
[01:22:07.720 --> 01:22:12.440]  that gave rise to the middle class if alex historically was the bubonic plague it wiped out
[01:22:12.440 --> 01:22:18.600]  half the population in europe lords needed to pay serfs more because there was a competition
[01:22:19.160 --> 01:22:23.400]  for labor suddenly for the first time and lords were in the dangerous cities and most of them
[01:22:23.400 --> 01:22:28.200]  died from fleas whereas the peasants out in the country survived in higher numbers it was actually
[01:22:28.200 --> 01:22:31.800]  wiping out of the elite i believe from the numbers that helped the best but you're right about the
[01:22:31.800 --> 01:22:37.320]  uh the rate of increased pay yeah so you had that was really the basis in the beginning of the middle
[01:22:37.320 --> 01:22:44.280]  class as we know it today and uh was due to that that plague now the the the the aristocrats and the
[01:22:44.280 --> 01:22:49.640]  monarchs uh they never bought into the whole idea of having a middle class i mean they're using this
[01:22:49.640 --> 01:22:54.120]  opportunity to take us back into the medieval times they would much prefer having lords and serfs
[01:22:54.120 --> 01:22:58.680]  they would much for having bilgerberg says that they say they want to bring back neo serfdom you're
[01:22:58.680 --> 01:23:03.880]  absolutely right well that they preferred i mean if you were one of the aristocrats you would rather
[01:23:03.880 --> 01:23:10.840]  have your minions toiling for you and having lavish parties that mean that's just human nature so
[01:23:10.840 --> 01:23:16.040]  that's what they're returning to they have the capability of doing this now and using what we
[01:23:16.040 --> 01:23:21.240]  talked about on your show last time interest rate apartheid which maybe is an apt phrase with the
[01:23:22.040 --> 01:23:29.320]  recent nasa mandala funeral apartheid is back on people's minds and the interest rate apartheid
[01:23:29.320 --> 01:23:35.160]  is basically that if you are one of a goldman sacks partner you can borrow money at zero percent
[01:23:35.160 --> 01:23:40.680]  but if you're out in the field you're a serf you're you're one of the working slaves you can't
[01:23:40.680 --> 01:23:45.640]  borrow money for less than 20 percent 25 percent if you go to a payday lender here in the uk you
[01:23:45.640 --> 01:23:51.000]  can be charged as much as 5000 percent annualized rates of return to borrow money so that's a way
[01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:56.680]  to keep the poor poor and if you can borrow money at zero percent and you can speculate by buying
[01:23:56.680 --> 01:24:04.040]  a building or a fine work of art and see if that goes up and have the benefit of if it crashes
[01:24:04.040 --> 01:24:10.520]  being bailed out by the government then you've got riskless returns for your risk-free money
[01:24:10.520 --> 01:24:16.120]  and everyone else has got to earn wages that are not even one-third the rate of inflation
[01:24:16.680 --> 01:24:21.000]  i want to show viewers a couple articles here that i've got a radio listeners can just go
[01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:26.600]  info wars.com and see them once from zero hedge market valuation has lost every anchor to real world
[01:24:26.600 --> 01:24:31.720]  says david stockman top advisor uh to ronald reagan here's another one out today from economic
[01:24:31.720 --> 01:24:38.520]  collapse blog on info wars.com dent fiber salente maloney rogers what do they say is coming in 2014
[01:24:38.520 --> 01:24:44.600]  and it's got a bunch of other oak capital howard marx financial editor jeff bruick a whole bunch of
[01:24:44.600 --> 01:24:49.960]  other top people robert schiller this article is really powerful because it shows scores of
[01:24:49.960 --> 01:24:53.320]  really smart guys that have been accurate they're basically saying what you're saying
[01:24:53.320 --> 01:24:59.640]  they're saying 2014 we're going to see the big fireworks we've seen a slow slide so far but
[01:24:59.640 --> 01:25:03.800]  because they've got all these computers and fraudulent you know systems they've suspended
[01:25:03.800 --> 01:25:10.280]  economic reality but you can't suspend markets forever and the word is once it breaks through
[01:25:11.400 --> 01:25:17.240]  it could go zimbabwe weimar republic or it could go into total depressionary freefall
[01:25:17.240 --> 01:25:22.760]  i mean bottom line ron paul was here yesterday and he said it's key to get the word out that
[01:25:22.760 --> 01:25:27.560]  the insider crony capitalist did this or they're going to use this collapse to bring in total
[01:25:27.560 --> 01:25:33.640]  state run systems while they sit offshore working the levers of state control and and and they're
[01:25:33.640 --> 01:25:38.600]  above the law with diplomatic community and are the recipients of the socialism they bring in as
[01:25:38.600 --> 01:25:44.120]  the answer to their crony capitalism so how do we navigate this and what do you say to your peers
[01:25:44.120 --> 01:25:52.760]  here basically saying what you're saying and give us an economic weather report here well the phrase
[01:25:52.760 --> 01:25:57.000]  markets are not tied to anything so let's just dive into that for a second and talk about what
[01:25:57.000 --> 01:26:05.880]  that means so markets are trading on expected valuations in the near future or medium term
[01:26:05.880 --> 01:26:11.880]  future based on corporations ability to make profits and make earnings what we find out in
[01:26:11.880 --> 01:26:17.800]  the last 20 years is that most of the profits made by corporations are being made by gaming their
[01:26:17.800 --> 01:26:23.800]  cash positions using derivatives and that these derivatives which are just financial bets are
[01:26:23.800 --> 01:26:31.560]  collateralized by less and less substantive worthy collateral and you see proof of this
[01:26:31.560 --> 01:26:38.360]  in the global sovereign bond market because the best collateral you could put up to speculate
[01:26:38.360 --> 01:26:43.800]  is a triple a sovereign bond over the past 10 or 15 years the number of sovereigns that have triple
[01:26:43.800 --> 01:26:49.720]  a credit is dropping america no longer has a triple a credit it was cut by by one of the agencies
[01:26:50.440 --> 01:26:54.920]  from a triple a status and that gives you an indication so this phrase markets aren't based
[01:26:54.920 --> 01:27:00.360]  on anything what it means basically is that the collateral upon which all this leverages base
[01:27:00.360 --> 01:27:07.080]  is eroding in real time and we get to a point where there is no there there there is no collateral
[01:27:07.080 --> 01:27:13.640]  that has no resale value at all if you were to have to resell city bank or jp morgan or royal
[01:27:13.640 --> 01:27:17.640]  bank of skyland or brockley's bank in the open market based on a market to market accounting
[01:27:17.640 --> 01:27:21.640]  based on what they actually have on their books and their balance sheet that some total you could
[01:27:21.640 --> 01:27:27.000]  get in the open market for those assets is zero as a matter of fact it's negative because they have
[01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:31.560]  hundreds of times more debt than they have in equity and the only thing that's keeping it alive
[01:27:31.560 --> 01:27:36.520]  are these cheap interest rates by guys like mark carney jenny yalon and ben Bernanke who keep these
[01:27:36.520 --> 01:27:42.440]  banks afloat by printing scads and scads of zero percent money but instead of buttressing the economy
[01:27:42.440 --> 01:27:48.040]  by offering ways to build new companies new companies that are offering real jobs it's going
[01:27:48.040 --> 01:27:54.920]  straight into speculation on real estate fine art now these other assets that all it all it has
[01:27:54.920 --> 01:28:01.000]  all it does is make that top one tenth of one percent aggregate an ever higher concentration
[01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:07.800]  of this free money and you end up with a chasm effect of absolute wealth concentration at the
[01:28:07.800 --> 01:28:13.720]  very top versus everyone else who's in abject poverty now as far as mark faber and these other
[01:28:14.360 --> 01:28:19.800]  fine folks who are predicting this next year's being the year of armageddon i i would posit that
[01:28:20.440 --> 01:28:25.720]  we are already seeing that in the emergence of these cryptocurrencies because the cryptocurrencies
[01:28:25.720 --> 01:28:31.800]  are already telling us that these asset values are crashing it's not that bitcoin is up at two
[01:28:31.800 --> 01:28:37.160]  thousand percent it's that these asset values that they say are worth something are collapsing
[01:28:37.160 --> 01:28:41.560]  by two thousand percent that's the message of bitcoin so we're seeing it right now that's my
[01:28:41.560 --> 01:28:46.680]  position we're going to get into bitcoins and you're a leading expert on that coming up in the
[01:28:46.680 --> 01:28:50.840]  next segment and then i go to phone calls i know i gave the number out and haven't gone to some of
[01:28:50.840 --> 01:28:56.200]  the calls yet this hour your calls are coming up thomas william greg ryan larry max kaiser can speak

[01:29:08.440 --> 01:29:13.320]  all i know is that they've made a conscious decision a decision to basically engage in
[01:29:13.320 --> 01:29:19.720]  in systematic institutional fraud to take over the entire civilization in an active economic
[01:29:19.720 --> 01:29:26.280]  conquest but i don't know how the power structure thinks they're going to escape the blowback in
[01:29:26.280 --> 01:29:33.160]  a culture and a society they live in of something this degrading i mean the rules of nature and
[01:29:33.160 --> 01:29:40.680]  nature's gods show that uh they will they will end up being torn limb from limb probably physically
[01:29:40.680 --> 01:29:46.520]  for what they've done but undoubtedly culturally we'll be right back with max kaiser i'm alex jones

[01:33:29.960 --> 01:33:35.240]  so that the population primitive league gets behind their leaders and then the new wave of
[01:33:35.240 --> 01:33:42.680]  fraud and looting and rationing begins all the politicians that started the wars hide in fact
[01:33:42.680 --> 01:33:49.640]  that's like the song war pigs with black Sabbath generals gathered in their masses just like witches

[01:35:12.920 --> 01:35:17.880]  henry ford didn't agree with a lot of stuff henry ford said but i did agree with paying
[01:35:17.880 --> 01:35:23.240]  his industrial workers in some cases 10 times but other workers were paid and you know why he
[01:35:23.240 --> 01:35:29.800]  had a plan he said if we start paying people a lot it'll just raise the quality of civilization
[01:35:30.360 --> 01:35:36.120]  and we can just industrialize everyone and make everyone rich he wanted to be the king
[01:35:36.760 --> 01:35:42.280]  of an incredibly industrialized society and an and an agrarian society wanted to empower farmers
[01:35:43.480 --> 01:35:49.320]  that's not how these people think and his thought was basic renaissance economics he didn't invent
[01:35:49.320 --> 01:35:58.680]  that you could sell more cars if uh if people are being paid a lot see that's been our economy
[01:35:58.680 --> 01:36:01.720]  they're getting us away from that now and their argument is it's bad for the earth well you can

[01:38:05.480 --> 01:38:08.440]  going back to max keiser max here's the question i'm trying to get across to you
[01:38:08.440 --> 01:38:10.440]  you
[01:38:10.440 --> 01:38:14.760]  the elite are acting like they don't care anymore it's like nero marrying or i guess
[01:38:14.760 --> 01:38:18.600]  it was colligal and married his horse and nero you know burning down half the city for fun
[01:38:18.600 --> 01:38:24.440]  while he played his fiddle they don't care anymore across the board it's getting crazier
[01:38:24.440 --> 01:38:29.960]  and crazier and crazier the looting the stealing the cop shooting some guy because the guy laughs
[01:38:29.960 --> 01:38:34.920]  at him the cop doesn't get in trouble i mean it just seems like not just the elite the public
[01:38:34.920 --> 01:38:41.000]  are going crazy with this unnatural system their drug ads now pushing you know and fedamins they
[01:38:41.000 --> 01:38:47.000]  give fighter pilots that three days of it makes you go crazy i mean what's happening in this mass
[01:38:47.000 --> 01:38:51.960]  mental craziness how do the elite think they're going to get away with all this max keiser i'll
[01:38:51.960 --> 01:39:02.600]  give you a new concept to chew on the virtuous cycle versus the vicious cycle now you mentioned
[01:39:02.600 --> 01:39:10.120]  henry ford a minute ago henry ford being a industrialist and an economist realized he
[01:39:10.120 --> 01:39:18.360]  could create a virtuous cycle by stimulating demand for his automobiles by raising the wages of his
[01:39:18.360 --> 01:39:25.800]  workers now when he raised the wages of his workers he did so by raising their cash in their
[01:39:25.800 --> 01:39:35.000]  paycheck now flash forward to 2013 and a vicious cycle central bankers like mark carney here in the
[01:39:35.000 --> 01:39:42.760]  uk say they want to stimulate demand just like henry ford wanted to how do they do it not by
[01:39:42.760 --> 01:39:51.400]  increasing people's cash by giving people more access to debt they increase demand by increasing
[01:39:51.400 --> 01:39:56.520]  debt and the reason this is a vicious cycle is because that debt has interest costs associated
[01:39:56.520 --> 01:40:01.800]  with it and the more you go into debt the more interest costs you incur and the slippery slope
[01:40:01.800 --> 01:40:10.520]  down into poverty you go and we see that vicious versus virtuous play out on a cultural sense when
[01:40:10.520 --> 01:40:17.000]  you have a group of people who now have access to interest free money and minions that'll work for
[01:40:17.000 --> 01:40:23.400]  free who are dying to get themselves greater into debt they'll stumble over each other they'll stab
[01:40:23.400 --> 01:40:29.160]  each other at walmart the day after thanksgiving to increase their debt load when you have people
[01:40:29.160 --> 01:40:36.600]  that foolish you become cruel you become evil you you enjoy then watching these gladiator
[01:40:36.600 --> 01:40:42.760]  shoppers kill each other to increase your rent income because you're selling them the access
[01:40:42.760 --> 01:40:51.000]  to more death and it creates a social class of very cruel and sadistic overlords and this is
[01:40:51.000 --> 01:40:59.800]  what rules in america around europe and in the uk devastatingly put and man a gladiator shoppers
[01:40:59.800 --> 01:41:05.960]  that is a great way to describe these people and they have an ebt malfunction in aliziana where
[01:41:05.960 --> 01:41:11.080]  people can buy unlimited they were just throwing random things in their baskets they didn't even
[01:41:11.080 --> 01:41:16.120]  care i mean it's like annoying to have to go to the store and buy stuff when you've lost it or
[01:41:16.120 --> 01:41:20.840]  broke it you know i hate having to go buy new stuff but i see other people just absolutely
[01:41:20.840 --> 01:41:25.400]  getting off on it and i'm not against materialism it's just that if it's at the top of your needs
[01:41:25.960 --> 01:41:32.120]  you're really a slave to it max and i just i see as one of the historical indicators of a society in
[01:41:32.120 --> 01:41:36.760]  decline and and i more and more realize max i don't think we're going to be able to pull out of this
[01:41:36.760 --> 01:41:44.120]  how do we as individuals protect ourselves do we have an economic revolution vote with our dollars
[01:41:44.120 --> 01:41:50.200]  do you think it's bitcoin uh because i want to ask you i see bitcoin is good you know an anarchic
[01:41:50.200 --> 01:41:56.200]  open uh cryptocurrency my problem is jp morgan chase as you know in 1999 had a patent on it how
[01:41:56.200 --> 01:41:59.480]  do we know they're not behind it how do we know they don't discredit the whole thing by blowing
[01:41:59.480 --> 01:42:03.640]  up their own system or how do we know they don't take it over if it isn't theirs and it does have
[01:42:03.640 --> 01:42:10.520]  a little bit of a farmville casino gulag look to it however one's out there mining it and like mad
[01:42:10.520 --> 01:42:15.240]  if you don't totally lay down and love it i mean i'm just kind of ambiguous on bitcoin and have a
[01:42:15.240 --> 01:42:21.240]  bad feeling in my stomach you have a good feeling i guess to tingle up your leg uh if you were uh
[01:42:21.240 --> 01:42:29.400]  slime ball chris mathews well you you run ads for bitcoin on your show so presumably if you believe
[01:42:29.400 --> 01:42:34.840]  in your advertisers you would believe in the bitcoin story no no no they're on the network
[01:42:34.840 --> 01:42:40.920]  ads any ad you hear i endorse i have my advertising that's part of how i'm paid by the network and
[01:42:40.920 --> 01:42:44.840]  then they have theirs but i'm not i'm not here running i let you come on and promote bitcoin
[01:42:44.840 --> 01:42:52.120]  i'm i'm really trying to understand it so you heard my question yeah okay so um i agree that it's
[01:42:52.120 --> 01:42:59.160]  uh difficult to and it doesn't have a warm and fuzzy quality about it that you can easily
[01:43:00.600 --> 01:43:08.520]  embrace it it's very kind of difficult to fathom because there's many moving parts to it but
[01:43:08.520 --> 01:43:15.160]  it's based on encryption and encryption gave us edward snowden who i it was a tremendous
[01:43:15.160 --> 01:43:19.880]  whistleblower should have been time person of the year and revealed an incredible amount of
[01:43:19.880 --> 01:43:24.040]  documents that are still being revealed that are completely playing havoc in the halls of power
[01:43:24.040 --> 01:43:28.520]  around the world that's all based on encryption you've got guys like kim dot com in new zealand
[01:43:28.520 --> 01:43:36.520]  who was taken down by the npaa with a uh swat team assault no i get it these are revolutionary guy
[01:43:36.520 --> 01:43:43.000]  foxes in every sense of the way so let me carry this through so encryption is the key to understanding
[01:43:43.000 --> 01:43:50.040]  why what makes bitcoin appealing and it's based on an encryption technology and the inventors of it
[01:43:50.040 --> 01:43:56.920]  figured out that to make sure that these coins were not double spent you could incentivize people to
[01:43:56.920 --> 01:44:04.200]  prove that the coins were all being accounted for by giving them a piece of the coins as they were
[01:44:04.200 --> 01:44:11.480]  being created so to speak and then you end up with this currency called bitcoin and initially
[01:44:11.480 --> 01:44:17.800]  it was a curiosity amongst the technology groups but since situations like cypress happened where
[01:44:17.800 --> 01:44:22.680]  you have the balance that you mentioned earlier people are looking for a place to store value
[01:44:22.680 --> 01:44:27.240]  gold and silver are problematic because number one the prices are being manipulated through
[01:44:27.240 --> 01:44:31.800]  artificial selling and it's hard to move a lot of gold and silver it's very heavy and it's obvious
[01:44:31.800 --> 01:44:36.760]  to see where you could put a hundred thousand dollars on a thumb drive or in a mind wallet
[01:44:36.760 --> 01:44:40.760]  or a paper wallet and walk across any border and take your money with you that's a lot of
[01:44:40.760 --> 01:44:45.160]  Chinese people are doing who are escaping sure or a few collector coins or some art that the
[01:44:45.160 --> 01:44:49.320]  idiot tsa doesn't know is worth five million dollars let's go back go go into this jp morgan
[01:44:49.320 --> 01:44:53.240]  situation because i agree with you that that is problematic because they came out this this week
[01:44:53.240 --> 01:44:57.240]  and said that they were renewing a patent that they have on virtual currencies as you know i'm
[01:44:57.240 --> 01:45:01.880]  the only one in the world that has four patents on virtual currencies particularly the key patent
[01:45:01.880 --> 01:45:09.320]  59517 and you are the creator of bitcoin no i'm not the bitcoin is an evolution in virtual currencies
[01:45:09.320 --> 01:45:14.920]  from what i did in the 90s to now this cryptocurrency it's a really remarkable break and and an
[01:45:14.920 --> 01:45:21.960]  achievement in the field of virtual currencies but i know this area very well and so you've got
[01:45:22.760 --> 01:45:28.040]  this uh jp morgan that's trying to resurrect some old patents and i this is what i see is
[01:45:28.040 --> 01:45:35.480]  going to happen they will jp morgan and others will try to stop bitcoin by engaging in a patent
[01:45:35.480 --> 01:45:42.040]  war or a copyright war the same way the record industry has tried to stop file sharing of music
[01:45:42.040 --> 01:45:47.720]  by attacking people on the basis of their violating copyright law so i think jp morgan and other
[01:45:47.720 --> 01:45:53.320]  banks will use patent law to try to disrupt the flow of bitcoin they don't have a case it's their
[01:45:53.320 --> 01:46:00.280]  patents don't really compete with bitcoin but look how congress just passed a law banning the printing
[01:46:00.280 --> 01:46:05.160]  of 3d guns i mean i really don't see how they can do that i don't see them they're using
[01:46:05.160 --> 01:46:10.040]  technology to enslave us but i don't see them being able to block us using technology to empower us
[01:46:10.040 --> 01:46:14.840]  just like they can't shut down the alternative media that only makes us that much hotter so so
[01:46:14.840 --> 01:46:20.840]  how do you see them trying to win well i think they'll try to attack the point the merchants and
[01:46:20.840 --> 01:46:25.960]  the exchanges by any you know they just passed so they're in the process of passing these global
[01:46:25.960 --> 01:46:31.400]  trade deals like tpp trans specific partnership that gives corporations if you looked into this
[01:46:31.400 --> 01:46:35.640]  i'm sure you covered on your show above government power but totally above government power so they
[01:46:35.640 --> 01:46:41.720]  can say that this patent that jp morgan claims to have dominion over is now going to be applied
[01:46:41.720 --> 01:46:48.120]  through the corporate powers of ttp globally and anyone who tries to do a merchant deal or an exchange
[01:46:48.120 --> 01:46:53.000]  that we're going to attack them uh using claiming the patent of violation it'll be a completely
[01:46:53.000 --> 01:46:57.560]  spurious suit it'll be a patent troll suit there'll be no merit whatsoever but it'll be backed by
[01:46:57.560 --> 01:47:03.400]  billions of dollars and remember in the case of copyright the npaa they chased chris dodd of the npaa
[01:47:03.400 --> 01:47:08.600]  hounded erin schwarz to the point where he killed himself that's they'll stop oh they really killed
[01:47:08.600 --> 01:47:13.480]  him he was getting married and everything they killed him his father said at the funeral that the
[01:47:13.480 --> 01:47:18.280]  government hounded my son to death so anyway that's chris dodd he's a he's a he's a murderer but
[01:47:18.280 --> 01:47:22.520]  he's typical american politician i don't think anyone should be surprised about that that's what
[01:47:22.520 --> 01:47:26.440]  they want to say this the ruling elite are are getting more and more lazy and that's why i think
[01:47:26.440 --> 01:47:31.080]  we're gonna be having a giant war i mean bottom line where do you see this going because bitcoin
[01:47:31.080 --> 01:47:36.840]  has survived i'm gonna go to calls it has survived some big plunges to go back up i just see it like
[01:47:36.840 --> 01:47:43.640]  the tulip mania or something where it's getting a little bit foaming at the mouth here i i think
[01:47:43.640 --> 01:47:49.400]  the analogy to tulips is incorrect tulips it really can't make the comparison at all and i
[01:47:49.400 --> 01:47:55.400]  for a lot of reasons but the the price appreciation is really really the first inning okay well what
[01:47:55.400 --> 01:48:00.280]  about derivatives i mean i mean what about derivatives i mean i get what what gives bitcoin
[01:48:00.280 --> 01:48:04.920]  its value i know it's an agreed upon mode of exchange and so i'm all i want to shadow the
[01:48:04.920 --> 01:48:08.760]  power of the fellow reserve it's just that intrinsically people say well are you for
[01:48:08.760 --> 01:48:13.800]  gold back or are you for fiat currencies well i i can debate both systems openly i'm not
[01:48:13.800 --> 01:48:18.040]  wedded to one or the other anything's better than what we've got right now if people are educated
[01:48:18.040 --> 01:48:24.280]  about it and the amount of its controlled and it's transparent right the bitcoin is a bitcoin
[01:48:24.280 --> 01:48:30.680]  protocol if i held in my hand a hundred thousand emails and i said out what is the intrinsic value
[01:48:30.680 --> 01:48:35.160]  of these emails depends on what's in them the answer is zero that has no intrinsic value no those
[01:48:35.160 --> 01:48:41.080]  emails those emails it's actual email data or the email well no it may be who you're contacting
[01:48:41.080 --> 01:48:45.800]  they have no intrinsic value they're just it's just it's just bits and bytes and and electrons
[01:48:45.800 --> 01:48:51.640]  there's no there's no intrinsic value but in the network of email uh to be able to communicate
[01:48:51.640 --> 01:48:56.440]  information around the world and collect information etc it's worth incalculable amount of money
[01:48:56.440 --> 01:49:05.000]  yeah okay similarly with bitcoin and the the intrinsic value a case has to do with the protocol
[01:49:05.000 --> 01:49:10.920]  which is applied across the global network incalculably valuable as a protocol to send
[01:49:10.920 --> 01:49:17.400]  money for example is the most widespread use of the bitcoin no so the value is the is the encryption
[01:49:17.400 --> 01:49:22.760]  is the network and the encrypted network and the ability to verify transactions so it's the protocol
[01:49:22.760 --> 01:49:27.000]  so you have to look at it like email or you look at it like a p2p file swapping that that's the one
[01:49:27.000 --> 01:49:33.480]  way to look at the intrinsic value case of bitcoin and it's it's like it's like the internet in 1994
[01:49:33.480 --> 01:49:38.520]  people say how do you think bitcoin's gonna go how do you think bitcoin's gonna go i think the
[01:49:38.520 --> 01:49:44.680]  smartest guy in the bitcoin space is a guy named he's a he's the uh in Stockholm Sweden he's founded
[01:49:44.680 --> 01:49:50.600]  the swedish pirate party his name is rik fokvinia and he made the case that bitcoin could capture
[01:49:50.600 --> 01:49:56.360]  between one percent and ten percent of the global forex market that's the foreign exchange market
[01:49:56.360 --> 01:50:01.560]  which it has an implied value per bitcoin of between a hundred thousand and a million per bitcoin
[01:50:01.560 --> 01:50:08.200]  you said he was he is he's a he's the smartest guy i want to get him on yes he should he is a
[01:50:08.200 --> 01:50:13.800]  fantastic guest well give me his contact info i'm sure rik fokvinia he's a fantastic guest he's
[01:50:13.800 --> 01:50:17.960]  he's one of the earliest supporters he he invented the swedish pirate party and he's a great guy
[01:50:17.960 --> 01:50:21.400]  there's a couple of other people he should have a like no no i've read well send me a list
[01:50:21.400 --> 01:50:26.600]  send me your element we have on kaiser forums magazine he's an excellent spokesperson roger
[01:50:26.600 --> 01:50:33.080]  ver who's the bit jesus and of bitcoin who gave away bitcoin for years just to get people to
[01:50:33.080 --> 01:50:38.840]  understand what it's all about he he just gave a million dollars away to the mesas institute
[01:50:38.840 --> 01:50:45.400]  beautiful yeah and folks are buying lamborghini's or whatever with them now it's it's amazing why
[01:50:45.400 --> 01:50:50.040]  just let the federal reserve guys and a bunch of old bankers have this power yeah you want
[01:50:50.040 --> 01:50:54.360]  federal reserve we don't need them i want to come back and take calls in this segment the next
[01:50:54.360 --> 01:50:59.960]  and stefan malin is scheduled to be with us or come back with thomas william greg ryan and larry

[01:55:09.400 --> 01:55:16.280]  on the air with your question or comment for the world at large go ahead yes sir i'd like to raise
[01:55:16.280 --> 01:55:27.080]  two points number one would be for any and everybody listening to this broadcast borrowing
[01:55:27.080 --> 01:55:38.680]  money to pay debt is about as idiotic as sticking your hand in a fire my second point is this
[01:55:40.840 --> 01:55:47.240]  for some time now people like yourself and others have reported that there are foreign troops
[01:55:47.240 --> 01:55:52.920]  training inside the united states borders it's all over the place they're just acclimating us for
[01:55:52.920 --> 01:55:59.800]  occupation yeah yes sir several men and i men of let's just say experience
[01:56:01.480 --> 01:56:08.840]  have taken it upon ourselves to investigate this in our own state we have personally witnessed
[01:56:11.800 --> 01:56:16.680]  close to three thousand russian troops are training in the state of kentucky
[01:56:16.680 --> 01:56:27.320]  we have also witnessed no more than 40 so far but un troops that are training in kentucky
[01:56:28.600 --> 01:56:33.240]  people need to wake up and look around you know i want to use a shoot video that put it on youtube
[01:56:33.240 --> 01:56:37.080]  and it become a big story now they're training russian german you name it and then training
[01:56:37.080 --> 01:56:43.480]  them for urban warfare in america and in leo 9 the pentagon admitted that fema drill that they
[01:56:43.480 --> 01:56:48.360]  were training foreign troops for unrest in america and we have deals with canada and mexico to help
[01:56:48.360 --> 01:56:53.960]  them as well and it really is just a slow incremental acclimation thank you so much for the call sir
[01:56:53.960 --> 01:56:59.720]  and good point on the debt uh max keiser i've seen cases where they have like ukrainian troops in
[01:56:59.720 --> 01:57:06.600]  scotland running checkpoints what do you think all this is really about in paris they have romanian
[01:57:06.600 --> 01:57:13.320]  police that are stopping romanian uh so-called gypsies uh because there's an influx of them so
[01:57:13.320 --> 01:57:18.280]  they allow they're allowing the romanian police to set up shop inside paris inside france so
[01:57:18.280 --> 01:57:22.920]  which is a remarkable development i think i think marconi is a bank of canada central
[01:57:22.920 --> 01:57:27.160]  banker they just dropped them into bank of england it buttresses your point about this new world
[01:57:27.160 --> 01:57:31.720]  order about this globalist agenda so the elite in these different countries are just plug and play

[02:00:53.480 --> 02:00:58.600]  max keiser anything else you'd like to add port and points that you've forgotten to get out there
[02:00:58.600 --> 02:01:03.880]  to folks well you mentioned earlier the group of people i was trying to reiterate this point
[02:01:03.880 --> 02:01:09.080]  mark fauber and others that are talking about 2014 being a watershed year to the turning point
[02:01:09.080 --> 02:01:14.440]  and market chaos and i just want to reiterate that i'm putting my my flag in the ground and
[02:01:14.440 --> 02:01:21.880]  saying that bitcoin is the phenomenon happening this year we this is in and next year we'll look
[02:01:21.880 --> 02:01:28.040]  back on 2013 and realize that bitcoin was the black swan bitcoin was the disruptive event that
[02:01:28.040 --> 02:01:32.840]  totally transformed the global economy and we won't be able to make that statement until this
[02:01:32.840 --> 02:01:37.560]  time next year looking back and say that's truly what happened but i just want to make sure i go
[02:01:37.560 --> 02:01:42.840]  on record as saying that i believe that all those people are correct is that i but i don't i believe
[02:01:42.840 --> 02:01:48.120]  they're missing the true the elephant in the room and that is bitcoin they're missing the bitcoin
[02:01:48.120 --> 02:01:55.320]  factor i believe they are because um they sense that there is this epic change coming i've talked
[02:01:55.320 --> 02:02:01.000]  about it on your show many times as many have but i think that the emergence of cryptography as it
[02:02:01.000 --> 02:02:07.080]  has changed the surveillance industry changed the global alliances is bleeding into currencies and
[02:02:07.080 --> 02:02:12.920]  that's a huge event it's the biggest event currencies in hundreds of years well when you've got 85 to
[02:02:12.920 --> 02:02:21.560]  1 100 to 1 200 to 1 profit to loss ratios uh or or or you've got stock ratios where the company's
[02:02:21.560 --> 02:02:26.280]  making no money but it's valued 100 times it's supposed profits we're in deep trouble here's
[02:02:26.280 --> 02:02:30.600]  that dave stockman clip that we talked about from bloomberg and the thing is now what we
[02:02:30.600 --> 02:02:36.760]  talk about is even invading uh dinosaur media here it is all right if ever i had a guy you're
[02:02:36.760 --> 02:02:41.720]  my budget guy tell me your impressions after combing through some of the numbers of what has
[02:02:41.720 --> 02:02:48.440]  been put forth by both parties yet to be voted on well first let's be clear it's a joke in a betrayal
[02:02:48.440 --> 02:02:55.000]  it's the final surrender of the house republican leadership to beltway politics and to kicking
[02:02:55.000 --> 02:03:02.040]  the can and ignoring this budget monster that's hurtling down the road they're busting the caps
[02:03:02.040 --> 02:03:07.800]  and it's totally unnecessary it's going to add 70 billion to spending this year and next year
[02:03:07.800 --> 02:03:13.640]  and then they're going to pretend to save it in 22 and 23 all right that's the cmbc clip
[02:03:13.640 --> 02:03:17.640]  where he's saying something similar let me let me actually read what he said here he said
[02:03:18.280 --> 02:03:23.320]  on bloomberg it's in our article market valuation has lost every anchor of the real world
[02:03:23.320 --> 02:03:27.320]  and you want to say this kind of speculative fraud that you get at the top of the cycle
[02:03:27.320 --> 02:03:31.720]  where valuation losses any anchor in the real world loses any anchor in the real world that
[02:03:31.720 --> 02:03:37.160]  videos up up on info wars dot com this is what we're talking about here so they can't criticize
[02:03:37.160 --> 02:03:42.120]  bitcoin claiming it's not connected to anything when what they're pushing is connected to a bunch
[02:03:42.120 --> 02:03:48.360]  of debt that we know has negative value and was based in fraud max geyser well they're basing their
[02:03:48.360 --> 02:03:55.240]  analysis or their value structure is tied to fiat money and fiat money by definition has
[02:03:55.240 --> 02:03:59.880]  no intrinsic value at all the dollars in your pocket are worthless except for the paper that
[02:03:59.880 --> 02:04:05.960]  they're not printed on as gerald salenti likes to say the bitcoin however by comparison is as
[02:04:05.960 --> 02:04:10.920]  you'd have to make the comparison to gold or silver it has real genuine intrinsic value and
[02:04:10.920 --> 02:04:16.280]  there has value on top of that as a means of exchange and as a store of value but he's absolutely
[02:04:16.280 --> 02:04:21.000]  correct stock market and the bond market in particular that's the key is trading at 300
[02:04:21.000 --> 02:04:26.360]  year highs in the uk and trading at 240 year highs in the united states we're out of time max
[02:04:26.360 --> 02:04:32.680]  will it completely go 1929 or what will the ongoing implosion look like slow masses are
[02:04:32.680 --> 02:04:39.800]  fighting by bitcoin that's my answer i know but i understand you've said that but i mean how bad
[02:04:39.800 --> 02:04:46.760]  do you think it's going to get there it's either going to be a complete and uttered right down of
[02:04:46.760 --> 02:04:51.320]  this bad debt in a deflationary depression or they're going to go be like china and print a trillion
[02:04:51.320 --> 02:04:54.920]  dollars a month and then it's hyperinflation and i think the answer is hyperinflation i don't think
[02:04:54.920 --> 02:04:58.280]  they're going to take their foot off the accelerator max geyser thanks for the time we'll talk to you

[02:08:31.480 --> 02:08:36.440]  because we ran out of time with max keiser but but stefan malin who could speak on basically
[02:08:36.440 --> 02:08:40.760]  any subject that's why i like watching his shows online or listening to him because it's
[02:08:40.760 --> 02:08:45.080]  thought provoking and i know a lot of history so i can tell when somebody's got a wide ranging
[02:08:45.080 --> 02:08:50.520]  knowledge not that anybody knows that much there's so much info in the world the more you learn the
[02:08:50.520 --> 02:08:56.120]  more you know how much you don't know then it's frightening to see the content public and establishment
[02:08:56.120 --> 02:09:02.040]  believing they know so much and see knowledge as a threat to their delusions but stefan malin
[02:09:02.040 --> 02:09:07.320]  new is the founder of freedom domain radio the largest most popular philosophical show in the
[02:09:07.320 --> 02:09:15.720]  world with more than 2400 podcast free domain radio with a 2400 podcast 10 books and 50 million
[02:09:15.720 --> 02:09:20.200]  download stefan has spread the cause of liberty and philosophy to listeners throughout the world
[02:09:20.200 --> 02:09:25.720]  prior to launching free domain radio stefan built a thriving career and as a software entrepreneur
[02:09:25.720 --> 02:09:31.480]  an executive in 2016 left his work in the tech industry to vote his efforts to his radio show
[02:09:31.480 --> 02:09:35.880]  now a self-identified full-time parent and philosopher stefan speaks regularly at liberty
[02:09:35.880 --> 02:09:42.360]  themed events all over north and south america stefan is the author of two novels revolutions
[02:09:42.360 --> 02:09:48.520]  and the god of atheist as well as eight non-fiction books on relationships government and religion
[02:09:49.080 --> 02:09:53.240]  and he's with us for the rest of the hour i got a bunch of news i want to cover with him randomly
[02:09:53.240 --> 02:09:57.080]  you know stuff that's broken today to get his take on different topics you know different
[02:09:57.080 --> 02:10:03.640]  angles of things and as someone i guess who identifies as an atheist i'm not mad at him or
[02:10:03.640 --> 02:10:10.440]  upset at him uh because he's a libertarian minded person and believes in human liberty and i agree
[02:10:10.440 --> 02:10:14.840]  with so much of what he has to say so many times i see atheists and they're statist in fact i would
[02:10:14.840 --> 02:10:19.880]  say on average most at least the atheist i know and run into their big time statist they think the
[02:10:19.880 --> 02:10:25.080]  state is god they've really created just another god and my whole argument is even if you don't
[02:10:25.080 --> 02:10:29.800]  believe in spiritual realms or you know the i can only see a tiny fraction of what's actually going
[02:10:29.800 --> 02:10:34.600]  on out there we know there's a lot of mysteries in the universe even if you don't believe in god
[02:10:34.600 --> 02:10:40.280]  i like the bill of rights and constitution because it has a higher power and people are on top
[02:10:40.280 --> 02:10:45.320]  then the state's under us well the state always wants to get up there where god is above us i
[02:10:45.320 --> 02:10:50.520]  don't want to get into an atheist debate here with stefan i just wanted to throw out that uh
[02:10:51.480 --> 02:10:56.120]  people say well you had a jew on your show or you had an atheist you had a catholic you had a
[02:10:56.120 --> 02:11:01.560]  protestant i'm not getting into all this infighting about what group somebody's in or what group
[02:11:01.560 --> 02:11:07.080]  they identify i identify with wanting to have a planet that survives a good future and my children
[02:11:07.080 --> 02:11:13.400]  having a good future and and i'm a fan of humanity and in devil's advocate they have the devil
[02:11:13.400 --> 02:11:19.480]  character played by al Pacino say i'm a fan of man well the the the art type of devil in a union
[02:11:20.120 --> 02:11:26.600]  way it wants to kill steal and destroy and it's not a fan of man god's creation made in god's image
[02:11:26.600 --> 02:11:35.320]  as a little creator so the devil doesn't want you to succeed isn't a fan of man it is a predatory
[02:11:35.320 --> 02:11:42.440]  system uh not a virtuous economic model as Max Kaiser was talking about but a vicious economic
[02:11:42.440 --> 02:11:49.240]  model where you enslave people to control them and so stefan joins us there's so much to get into
[02:11:49.240 --> 02:11:53.880]  i want to get into a new vigil ad for one of these uh stimulant drugs they're pushing because it's
[02:11:53.880 --> 02:11:58.520]  so hilarious the video that goes along with it uh and get his take at the bottom of the hour on
[02:11:58.520 --> 02:12:04.840]  that and take calls i want to get into obama care the open collapse of the establishment with al-qaeda
[02:12:04.840 --> 02:12:09.320]  publicly working for the u.s government nato now what does that do to their narrative i want to get
[02:12:09.320 --> 02:12:13.720]  into where he thinks the world's going with china i'm because we know when governments get in trouble
[02:12:13.720 --> 02:12:18.200]  they start big wars well you can't do that anymore they have nuclear weapons so there's so much to
[02:12:18.200 --> 02:12:23.320]  talk about but step on out of the gates what do you want to talk about first or you want to respond
[02:12:23.320 --> 02:12:31.160]  to anything i've just said well i i agree with you about i call them statheists or rather i want
[02:12:31.160 --> 02:12:35.720]  people to be statheists which is to not believe in the state there's this horrible thing that happens
[02:12:35.720 --> 02:12:40.440]  in history as i'm sure you're aware it's sort of like you have a balloon and you push one side of
[02:12:40.440 --> 02:12:45.480]  the balloon in and the other side bulges out if you look at the atheistic political philosophies
[02:12:45.480 --> 02:12:52.520]  like communism they may carve out a deity from the hierarchy of human thought and then like a giant
[02:12:52.520 --> 02:12:59.080]  vacuum state power rushes in to replace that uh so i think that it's actually more dangerous much
[02:12:59.080 --> 02:13:03.880]  more dangerous to replace religion with the state which seems to be the default position of most
[02:13:03.880 --> 02:13:09.000]  people who have secular concerns they tend to be socialist there's that traditional alignment of the
[02:13:09.000 --> 02:13:14.600]  left with agnosticism or atheism uh you know you may believe in religion i may not believe in
[02:13:14.600 --> 02:13:19.160]  religion but neither of us get to use the state to impose our will on the other but when you get
[02:13:19.160 --> 02:13:24.680]  people who believe in the state it becomes this massive sort of damocles that you use to flatten
[02:13:24.680 --> 02:13:29.320]  the aspirations and potential of everyone else around you so i completely agree you know live
[02:13:29.320 --> 02:13:34.360]  and let live as far as personal belief goes but when people cross the border into wanting to
[02:13:34.360 --> 02:13:39.080]  wield political power which comes more from the left than from the right then we have great grounds
[02:13:39.080 --> 02:13:45.400]  for significant disagreement well as a guy that studies trends in history where are we right now
[02:13:45.400 --> 02:13:50.280]  i mean my gut tells me but ron paul was on yesterday he concurred we're at the crossroads right now
[02:13:50.280 --> 02:13:55.800]  do you concur with that and what do we do during this flux point where more change happens in a
[02:13:55.800 --> 02:14:03.000]  decade that happens in the next hundred years what do we do i agree with ron paul uh i agree with you
[02:14:03.000 --> 02:14:08.600]  we are it is now or never i think this point in human history is the fulcrum it is now or never
[02:14:08.600 --> 02:14:13.080]  you ever played this game when you're a kid you have a sort of slide a teeter totter and you sort
[02:14:13.080 --> 02:14:17.400]  of walk up one end and then it tips you go down the other i think we're at that tipping point as
[02:14:17.400 --> 02:14:23.320]  far as what we do well most people have no ethical standards whatsoever that doesn't mean that they're
[02:14:23.320 --> 02:14:27.960]  evil or they're out there strangling hobos or anything it just means that they go with whatever
[02:14:27.960 --> 02:14:33.240]  is most comfortable right so if the media says hey now some mandela is a hero then everyone flies out
[02:14:33.240 --> 02:14:38.680]  and takes their self pictures smiling away at the funeral and they call him a hero uh they'll just say
[02:14:38.680 --> 02:14:43.400]  whatever people tell them to you need the government for protection our foreign policy is noble we're
[02:14:43.400 --> 02:14:48.200]  going to bring democracy to iraq whatever people hear that is convincing that's what they will
[02:14:48.200 --> 02:14:52.440]  believe they just do what is most comfortable i think the goal and this is all the way back to
[02:14:52.440 --> 02:15:01.400]  socrates the goal of thinkers is to make it more uncomfortable to be a compromist than to be an
[02:15:01.400 --> 02:15:05.800]  independent thinker right now it's pretty comfortable to be a compromise to believe that the government
[02:15:05.800 --> 02:15:09.400]  is going to help you and the war on terror is justified and you know we were defending freedoms
[02:15:09.400 --> 02:15:13.240]  all around the world that's comfortable nobody's going to really get upset with you about that
[02:15:13.240 --> 02:15:18.280]  i think that we really need to work to make it less comfortable to be a compromise to hit people
[02:15:18.280 --> 02:15:23.160]  with information and perspectives that are going to throw them out of the matrix push their face
[02:15:23.160 --> 02:15:28.040]  into the static of propaganda that they've been bathed in since virtually the day they were born
[02:15:28.040 --> 02:15:32.120]  we have to keep pushing people off balance and making them uncomfortable so that then when they're
[02:15:32.120 --> 02:15:37.240]  going with the flow it's actually this it's uncomfortable for them rather than comfortable
[02:15:37.240 --> 02:15:42.840]  and that is really based upon the willingness to just be annoying to people and to consistently
[02:15:42.840 --> 02:15:47.880]  remind them that truth reason virtue and evidence is how we make decisions not the political
[02:15:47.880 --> 02:15:54.680]  momentum of a dead history very well said just some breaking news right now
[02:15:54.680 --> 02:15:58.600]  just about five minutes ago before we went live or about six seven minutes ago during the break
[02:15:58.600 --> 02:16:04.520]  there's a wichita kansas bomb scare with the police and tsa and everyone up there saying they
[02:16:04.520 --> 02:16:09.320]  caught someone who was in a bomb plot turns out over a hundred times the last few years and the
[02:16:09.320 --> 02:16:14.200]  new york times even reports the fbis found mentally ill people who aren't even connected to real
[02:16:14.200 --> 02:16:18.760]  terror cells the real terror cells work for the cia and others that are actually attacking
[02:16:18.760 --> 02:16:23.640]  sovereign countries and trying to overthrow them right now uh but i was even joking during the
[02:16:23.640 --> 02:16:27.640]  break and talking to the guys probably something they're grandstanding or staged or you know wound
[02:16:27.640 --> 02:16:34.360]  up one of their patsies and sure enough they're now saying the fbi wound up it'll be the same
[02:16:34.360 --> 02:16:42.200]  mo some a ad iq mentally ill person i'm predicting wichita kansas the fbi joint terrorism task force
[02:16:42.200 --> 02:16:48.520]  arrested the man uh as he used his airport access card so i guess he worked there he says the man
[02:16:48.520 --> 02:16:53.080]  was attempting to deliver what he believed to be a vehicle loaded with explosive which he would
[02:16:53.080 --> 02:16:59.400]  detonate and take his own life in the process and you can bet money they approached him to lead
[02:16:59.400 --> 02:17:03.880]  the plot and and so many times folks i've said this if they asked you to be part of a drill
[02:17:04.600 --> 02:17:09.480]  if you work in an airport they will set you up to to make it again i don't mean to digress
[02:17:09.480 --> 02:17:14.280]  stephan but what do you think about honeybees kill more people you can look it up than terrorist
[02:17:14.280 --> 02:17:20.280]  every year most the terrorism staged and then all the obvious pageantry and grandstanding
[02:17:20.280 --> 02:17:24.760]  that i need to have armored vehicles and checkpoints and that be surveilled illegally
[02:17:24.760 --> 02:17:29.560]  or or ben laden's going to shove a hand grenade you know at my rear end i mean what do we do about
[02:17:29.560 --> 02:17:37.080]  this well like all things alex we try to make decisions based upon facts and we steadfastly
[02:17:37.080 --> 02:17:43.080]  resist the lemming horde plunge off the cliff of terrified propaganda what are the basic facts about
[02:17:43.080 --> 02:17:48.040]  terrorism the basic facts about terrorism are twofold the first is that you are seven times more
[02:17:48.040 --> 02:17:53.800]  likely to be killed by a cop than you are by a terrorist even if we include the obvious gruesome
[02:17:53.800 --> 02:17:58.760]  outlier of 9 11 you are seven times more likely to be killed by a cop than you are by a terrorist so
[02:17:58.760 --> 02:18:03.080]  if we look at the numbers we would say that army cops to fight terrorists is going to put this
[02:18:03.080 --> 02:18:07.880]  the civilian population in far more danger that's the first thing to understand of course the second
[02:18:07.880 --> 02:18:15.080]  thing to understand is that terrorists are created by terrorism terrorism is a virus that breeds like
[02:18:15.080 --> 02:18:20.280]  any disease or virus in a petri dish and by the way they go out and the the the the 12 year war on
[02:18:20.280 --> 02:18:27.720]  terror has tripled the terrorism the pentagon even admits yeah yeah and they kill 35 innocent
[02:18:27.720 --> 02:18:33.720]  civilians to kill one person that they identify as a terrorist and how do they find out if he's a
[02:18:33.720 --> 02:18:38.600]  terrorist or some guy they're torturing or some guy they're going to throw in prison for 20 years
[02:18:38.600 --> 02:18:44.120]  under the threat of of torture and imprisonment he says oh that guy uh he's a terrorist and so
[02:18:44.120 --> 02:18:47.800]  they go and blow him up we don't know if he's a terrorist or not the rule of law has completely
[02:18:47.800 --> 02:18:52.600]  disintegrated now they're just calling in drone strikes and they just what is it in yamen recently
[02:18:52.600 --> 02:18:57.640]  they just drone struck a wedding 15 people it's monstrous and we're going to just get more and
[02:18:57.640 --> 02:19:01.400]  more of this blowback until we learn the lesson that if you go poking a hornet's nest you're
[02:19:01.400 --> 02:19:06.440]  going to damn well get stung and then when they all attack they then organize them and get part
[02:19:06.440 --> 02:19:11.720]  of iraq to al qaeda and turn them loose on on syria i'm not a fan of syria but i mean syria is
[02:19:11.720 --> 02:19:18.920]  not attacking anybody well where is the self-defense i mean in international law the only legitimate
[02:19:18.920 --> 02:19:26.280]  use of a military is in a case of imminent self-defense and which of the us wars have ever
[02:19:26.280 --> 02:19:31.240]  been based upon imminent self-defense y'all if i can use the phrase y'all have peaceful neighbors to
[02:19:31.240 --> 02:19:35.960]  the north and south you have giant oceans to the east and west when was the last time america was
[02:19:35.960 --> 02:19:41.880]  threatened with invasion 1812 canada it's been about 200 years i think it might be okay to lay
[02:19:41.880 --> 02:19:46.760]  down a few of the weapons and and relax in a hammock for a while well instead of building a
[02:19:46.760 --> 02:19:51.000]  giant army of mordor to take over the planet and try to take my guns so they have the monopoly of

[02:24:22.760 --> 02:24:28.200]  attacks and this is all just used for a giant power grab while the government runs the real
[02:24:28.200 --> 02:24:33.400]  radical muslims and other groups going back to stephan malinu philosopher researcher radio
[02:24:33.400 --> 02:24:37.480]  talk show hosts all around it interesting guy there's only a six minute segment some of your
[02:24:37.480 --> 02:24:43.960]  calls coming up at the start of the next segment but looking at all this other news as the public
[02:24:43.960 --> 02:24:51.480]  gets more unlogical as the public gets more dumbed down or as one segment of it does we see a
[02:24:51.480 --> 02:24:57.800]  shifting by president obama and the establishment towards propaganda and entertainment and they
[02:24:57.800 --> 02:25:03.960]  admit this and not even having news anymore just getting rid of dinosaur press attacking
[02:25:03.960 --> 02:25:10.840]  alternative media which is the only media that's left cnn msnbc over time to leave news entirely
[02:25:10.840 --> 02:25:16.600]  and then just implant their messages and sitcom dramas and have hollywood stars promote obama care
[02:25:16.600 --> 02:25:22.120]  saying it'll lower your prices when it actually increases them so it's really a war on reality
[02:25:22.120 --> 02:25:28.120]  by the establishment and more and more i realize they're engaged in a conscious war against common
[02:25:28.120 --> 02:25:34.120]  sense a do you agree with that and be how do we counter it where there's a large minority of us
[02:25:34.120 --> 02:25:38.440]  who aren't perfect but we know fraud when we see it and we know that free market and liberty works a
[02:25:38.440 --> 02:25:44.600]  lot better than collectivist tyranny how do we reach out to the zombie five folks because i know
[02:25:44.600 --> 02:25:50.120]  smart people that when they see a celebrity on tv start drooling and getting excited and would
[02:25:50.120 --> 02:25:55.080]  slit their throat if the celebrity you know came down from heaven and talk to him if the celebrity
[02:25:55.080 --> 02:26:00.680]  told him to how do you get them out of this programming well of course the first fraud we
[02:26:00.680 --> 02:26:06.600]  need to talk about is the fact that the current pimp for obama care is adam levine the singer who
[02:26:06.600 --> 02:26:11.640]  was named sexiest man alive as if they've never seen you in a thong alex i mean how that's the
[02:26:11.640 --> 02:26:17.560]  first fraud that that you have not made the cover of people in something incredibly skimpy so once
[02:26:17.560 --> 02:26:22.200]  we can crack through the matrix in that standpoint but what i said to people about obama care it gives
[02:26:22.200 --> 02:26:27.400]  very two two very sort of brief points the first of course is that it's completely illegal the reason
[02:26:27.400 --> 02:26:32.120]  of course is that the executive in the united states the president has no power to pass laws he has
[02:26:32.120 --> 02:26:39.000]  no power to pass laws only congress has that power now they have written 30 times more regulations
[02:26:39.000 --> 02:26:47.240]  into obama care since it was originally passed with no input from congress whatsoever so 30 times
[02:26:47.240 --> 02:26:51.240]  even if we accept that congress got the first law right when nobody read it and they lied about it
[02:26:51.240 --> 02:26:56.680]  anyway 30 times the amount of law has been written since it would not with no no feedback from no
[02:26:56.680 --> 02:27:00.760]  input from congress that makes the laws automatically invalid and they keep changing the rules all the
[02:27:00.760 --> 02:27:05.880]  time with no input from congress this is a government by fiat this is fascistic in its essence
[02:27:05.880 --> 02:27:11.640]  the second thing is that over 1300 organizations have been granted exemptions from obama care
[02:27:11.640 --> 02:27:15.960]  including all of the unions and the public sector unions who were behind it to begin with they're
[02:27:15.960 --> 02:27:21.480]  all now begging to be let out of this little hamster cage from hell and so the reality is that
[02:27:21.480 --> 02:27:26.680]  in the constitution very clearly spells out you must have equal treatment under the law the moment
[02:27:26.680 --> 02:27:32.200]  you pass a law amend it afterwards with no input from congress and then you exempt 1300 of your
[02:27:32.200 --> 02:27:37.560]  closest friends and closest friends organizations from the application of the law invalid game over
[02:27:37.560 --> 02:27:42.120]  no need for further debate or discussion but of course the media doesn't tell anyone this basic
[02:27:42.120 --> 02:27:48.920]  stuff exactly and you know for me i know i oprah wimfrey and msnbc push racism all day because
[02:27:48.920 --> 02:27:53.400]  in my life and in growing up when i see it really is getting a lot better i mean everybody's just
[02:27:53.400 --> 02:27:57.880]  coming together basically that's what i see in austin texas and all over the country i see it all
[02:27:57.880 --> 02:28:02.680]  over the world and but they got to keep it going because the real discrimination is that all these
[02:28:02.680 --> 02:28:08.120]  special interest groups coupled with government are exempt and basically have diplomatic immunity
[02:28:08.120 --> 02:28:13.240]  from everything they're foisting on us it's a unified system that's the real discrimination
[02:28:13.240 --> 02:28:18.360]  and the real global civil rights movement is about not letting government corporations
[02:28:18.360 --> 02:28:25.880]  be exempt from laws they pass or lobby for yeah i mean white western culture is really
[02:28:25.880 --> 02:28:30.920]  pretty good at fighting authority you know all the way from the the ancient greeks who were the
[02:28:30.920 --> 02:28:35.480]  first to come up with democracy and philosophy all the way through the romans who tried their very
[02:28:35.480 --> 02:28:38.920]  best to limit the power of the state of course it broke through the bonds of what they called the
[02:28:38.920 --> 02:28:42.600]  constitution at the time just as the american government does all the way through all the
[02:28:42.600 --> 02:28:47.080]  struggles that went on to limit our aristocratic power the ending of the aristocracy throughout
[02:28:47.080 --> 02:28:51.400]  most of europe the fencing of it in of in england during the glorious revolution the
[02:28:51.400 --> 02:28:54.840]  that we've been pretty good and i say we very loosely here but sort of white western culture
[02:28:54.840 --> 02:29:00.760]  has been pretty good at trying to fight centralized and coercive authority white western culture
[02:29:00.760 --> 02:29:06.760]  has been was not just at the forefront but was the sole cultural force that worked and spent
[02:29:06.760 --> 02:29:11.240]  blood and treasure worldwide to end the worldwide practice of slavery now we've stumbled and we've
[02:29:11.240 --> 02:29:15.800]  created all kinds of messes but we are as a culture really quite good at trying to fight
[02:29:15.800 --> 02:29:21.160]  centralized coercive power and then of course even though our ancestors for one of a better
[02:29:21.160 --> 02:29:25.720]  phrase works really hard to end the worldwide practice of slavery generally only white racism
[02:29:25.720 --> 02:29:30.600]  is ever talked about which historically is not exactly accurate that's where i want to go next
[02:29:30.600 --> 02:29:34.280]  is look at lots of other groups first yeah i want you to come back give me the floor on
[02:29:34.280 --> 02:29:39.640]  mandela and that because i've studied history and i know slavery was worldwide but then in the
[02:29:39.640 --> 02:29:44.600]  history books were taught slavery is a white invention and that whites inherently are the
[02:29:44.600 --> 02:29:49.160]  devil and and why is that well because it's the western culture architecture they want to get
[02:29:49.160 --> 02:29:56.200]  rid of it stay with us we're on the march the empire's on the run alex jones and the gcn radio
[02:29:56.200 --> 02:30:05.560]  network why does the united states spend the largest percentage of gdp in the world on healthcare

[02:36:18.760 --> 02:36:22.520]  out of the bottle no matter what they try they're not going to succeed but we have syspa and sopa
[02:36:22.520 --> 02:36:28.200]  and all these other partnerships and attempts to censor the press using fake copyright i want
[02:36:28.200 --> 02:36:34.440]  your take on the media wars that are coming where you think that's going but first mandela
[02:36:34.440 --> 02:36:39.400]  i've studied a lot about south africa and it seems to me they traded one evil out for another
[02:36:39.400 --> 02:36:43.800]  and i saw your video you did on it last week and thought it was spot on and you were starting to
[02:36:43.800 --> 02:36:50.040]  allude to it now if you really study history everyone basically had a caste system or what
[02:36:50.040 --> 02:36:56.520]  you call slavery from india to china to japan if if a samurai had a new sword wanted to test it out
[02:36:56.520 --> 02:37:00.760]  they go chop a villager up that was their divine right wanted to have sex with you you had to roll
[02:37:00.760 --> 02:37:04.520]  over and let them and they were kind of a more cultured group of tyranny you could say i'm not
[02:37:04.520 --> 02:37:10.360]  knocking japanese culture every culture had slaves romans had white slaves had black slaves you name
[02:37:10.360 --> 02:37:15.640]  it uh some greek societies have what you call slaves others didn't even fight with them over it
[02:37:15.640 --> 02:37:20.200]  there were riots 500 years ago in the transatlantic slave trade because they phased out some white
[02:37:20.200 --> 02:37:25.000]  slavery in europe so they went on sort of grabbing blacks uh which they picked up from the arab's
[02:37:25.000 --> 02:37:29.000]  not demonizing arab's is just a fact the arab's are still running slavery in north africa but
[02:37:29.000 --> 02:37:33.400]  that's trendy and cool uh we're told it's a different type of slavery all i hear all day is
[02:37:33.400 --> 02:37:38.840]  i'm bad western culture is bad and and western culture is dying and the western elite are
[02:37:38.840 --> 02:37:45.080]  helping kill it why are they doing that you've got the floor well there's a small topic to deal with
[02:37:45.080 --> 02:37:51.800]  well i mean very briefly of course as you know whites did not go to africa and go into the
[02:37:51.800 --> 02:37:56.200]  country and capture you know the the peaceful slaves or peaceful blacks and dragged them off in
[02:37:56.200 --> 02:38:00.920]  slavery uh whites couldn't survive in africa because we didn't have the immune system to deal
[02:38:00.920 --> 02:38:05.640]  with all the plagues the average life expectancy for a white who left to the coast and went inland
[02:38:05.640 --> 02:38:10.440]  was about 11 months so the black slave trade and the arab slave trade the middle eastern slave
[02:38:10.440 --> 02:38:14.600]  trade was humming along and whites went in and bought the slaves from the coastal cities and took
[02:38:14.600 --> 02:38:19.320]  them away all nasty stuff i mean slavery is a fundamental moral abomination nobody has any
[02:38:19.320 --> 02:38:24.680]  argument with that i read the redish reports from 300 years ago where on average a third of the ship
[02:38:24.680 --> 02:38:30.760]  would die of the white sailors just going to pick up slaves and that was why the first multicultural
[02:38:30.760 --> 02:38:34.920]  pirate ships were created it wasn't that they wanted to even revolt it was a death sentence
[02:38:34.920 --> 02:38:40.840]  if you came back on a second mission go ahead well and the the the the whites who were sailing the
[02:38:40.840 --> 02:38:45.320]  ships were themselves slaves they were press ganged into this i mean it was the government
[02:38:45.320 --> 02:38:50.440]  power which is evil all over the world pretty much which needs to be fought but the so what
[02:38:50.440 --> 02:38:55.000]  happened of course was the with a sort of an awakening conscience consciousness which came
[02:38:55.000 --> 02:38:59.560]  out of the renaissance and the enlightenment egalitarianism the spirit of man the universality
[02:38:59.560 --> 02:39:04.040]  of ethics and so on which was of course in the declaration of independence and was supposed
[02:39:04.040 --> 02:39:08.120]  to be a more foundational part of the u.s constitution they started to say well maybe owning
[02:39:08.120 --> 02:39:12.920]  other human beings like livestock is not really that great an idea and the royal navy sailed
[02:39:12.920 --> 02:39:17.320]  around the seas not in terms of conquest there certainly was that that element to it but they
[02:39:17.320 --> 02:39:20.120]  were out there trying to catch slavers and trying to end the practice of slavery the
[02:39:20.120 --> 02:39:25.640]  british government bribed many arabic governments to have them stop paid slave owners to to have
[02:39:25.640 --> 02:39:30.120]  them stop having their slaves and they had to catch these slave ships really quickly because
[02:39:30.120 --> 02:39:34.280]  if you were a slave ship a royal navy ship comes up behind you if they think they're
[02:39:34.280 --> 02:39:38.120]  going to catch if you think you're going to get caught you cut the throats of your slaves and
[02:39:38.120 --> 02:39:42.520]  you dump them in the water they had to catch them under cover of night they had to steal on the ships
[02:39:42.520 --> 02:39:47.080]  to do this this is how committed they were to ending this moral abomination called slavery
[02:39:47.080 --> 02:39:52.360]  and this is nowhere taught it is nowhere understood because i think fundamentally white guilt is a
[02:39:52.360 --> 02:39:56.440]  very profitable resource for people to tweak you know you make a white person feel guilty they'll
[02:39:56.440 --> 02:40:01.000]  be like oh here's some benefits here's affirmative action here's taxes here's whatever you want just
[02:40:01.560 --> 02:40:05.960]  stop making me feel guilty and then that hamstrings the people that are getting the handouts
[02:40:05.960 --> 02:40:11.480]  and then that hamstrings the people that are becoming dependent right yeah and and of course
[02:40:11.480 --> 02:40:15.960]  in africa now south africa in particular i mean it's monstrous apartheid of course was immoral
[02:40:15.960 --> 02:40:20.760]  and racist and so on but we do have to look to some degree at the relative ethics at the time
[02:40:20.760 --> 02:40:25.880]  all of the other blacks in africa were dying to get into south africa i visited there a few times
[02:40:25.880 --> 02:40:30.280]  and i have a little bit of experience there and people were trying to get into south africa 60
[02:40:30.280 --> 02:40:34.360]  percent blacks and whites now say that they were better off under apartheid and if you're saying
[02:40:34.360 --> 02:40:39.400]  that you're better off under apartheid that is not exactly a ringing endorsement of your current
[02:40:39.400 --> 02:40:45.080]  system south africa is the rape and murder capital of the world at the moment it is a disintegrating
[02:40:45.080 --> 02:40:50.200]  country and uh i think it's partly because they didn't really go back and learn the lessons of
[02:40:50.200 --> 02:40:54.440]  the american revolution and you had a bunch of communists of which nelson mandela was first
[02:40:54.440 --> 02:40:59.000]  and foremost he wrote a treatise in his youth called how to be a good communist did not explicitly
[02:40:59.000 --> 02:41:04.120]  reject these views and so the virus of socialism landed in africa in the same way that it landed
[02:41:04.120 --> 02:41:09.560]  after the raj ended in 1949 in india you get all these socialists who go out there and try and set
[02:41:09.560 --> 02:41:14.360]  up this central planning communist socialist dystopia and then things go to heck in a hand
[02:41:14.360 --> 02:41:18.040]  basket and nobody sits there and says well it's because people aren't free to trade and own property
[02:41:18.040 --> 02:41:22.360]  and government interfering with everything it's the same lesson that we learned brutally for
[02:41:22.360 --> 02:41:26.760]  hundreds of years and we've forgotten to teach other people well george arwell valiantly joined
[02:41:26.760 --> 02:41:30.760]  the communist because he'd been a member of the british imperial police eric blair was his real name
[02:41:30.760 --> 02:41:34.680]  until he went and fought in the in the abraham lincoln brigades and got shot in the throat in the
[02:41:34.680 --> 02:41:41.160]  spanish civil war against hitler's forces and then he wrote about in his books i read him how the
[02:41:41.160 --> 02:41:45.560]  communist leaders were actually just like bank robber criminal rapist who were using all the
[02:41:45.560 --> 02:41:50.760]  well-meaning communists to set up and just take over and that they couldn't beat the nazis because
[02:41:50.760 --> 02:41:56.360]  the communists were just so criminal they couldn't even organize the nazis were actually ideologues
[02:41:56.360 --> 02:42:03.240]  who believe what they were doing and it's just incredible there is this belief that we have
[02:42:03.240 --> 02:42:08.520]  you know ordinary criminals like pickpockets and so on and then we have organized criminals
[02:42:08.520 --> 02:42:14.040]  like the mafia and so on and then above those people like this archway above society is this
[02:42:14.040 --> 02:42:18.920]  glowing godhood of statism that protects us from all these nazi little people i think that the
[02:42:18.920 --> 02:42:24.040]  historically accurate if not currently accurate view is that the incompetent criminals are out
[02:42:24.040 --> 02:42:29.240]  there picking your pockets the more competent criminals are organizing into mobs but the most
[02:42:29.240 --> 02:42:34.440]  competent criminals run for office and end up in charge of the state they are the best of the best
[02:42:34.440 --> 02:42:38.280]  they're not there to protect you from criminals because they're kind of pursuing the same methodology
[02:42:38.280 --> 02:42:43.560]  but better and that's what zabinia brzezinski has said in three of his books he admits that they
[02:42:43.560 --> 02:42:49.240]  run every criminal operation to control it for our own good though stefan we've got to be thankful
[02:42:49.240 --> 02:42:53.480]  they launder the drug money and run the little kids and you know do everything we've got to be
[02:42:53.480 --> 02:42:59.480]  thankful they made drugs illegal to make larger profits see how they helped us well of course
[02:42:59.480 --> 02:43:03.160]  you hear this argument all the time without the government and the police who on earth would
[02:43:03.160 --> 02:43:07.000]  protect your property alex uh first of all if you're allowed to own your own weaponry your
[02:43:07.000 --> 02:43:12.040]  property is pretty safe to begin with and secondly how can i claim that somebody is there to protect
[02:43:12.040 --> 02:43:17.640]  my property when they take over 50 percent of it at source and not even counting unfunded liabilities
[02:43:17.640 --> 02:43:21.640]  debts and deficits when they take about 50 percent of my money that's right how can they be said to
[02:43:21.640 --> 02:43:25.800]  be protecting my money that's right the average cop can be a really good person on average i've
[02:43:25.800 --> 02:43:30.600]  actually found them to be you know a lot of more servants but doesn't matter the big state is there
[02:43:30.600 --> 02:43:36.200]  to support as you've said and protect the farm animals from rogue wolves and coyotes that might
[02:43:36.200 --> 02:43:41.800]  try to come snack on a pig or a goat or a sheep or a chicken or you know stop a weasel the larger
[02:43:41.800 --> 02:43:47.400]  weasel is guarding the henhouse from other weasels that aren't in his employ the system is there to
[02:43:47.400 --> 02:43:53.160]  protect their racket over us and now they're getting greedy and have created a gender 21
[02:43:54.280 --> 02:44:01.240]  cosmology nomenclature where they fantasize that social engineering is looting us to reduce us
[02:44:01.240 --> 02:44:06.520]  down to the level of beggars to save the earth while they themselves are the ones with government
[02:44:06.520 --> 02:44:11.800]  mismanagement allowing the degradation of the environment it's incredible i mean the fruits of
[02:44:11.800 --> 02:44:20.680]  these people is literally liquid death well you know one of the great tragedies of history alex
[02:44:20.680 --> 02:44:27.160]  is that a truly free market doesn't have much use for sophists and sociopaths and all of the
[02:44:27.160 --> 02:44:31.560]  predatory wordsmiths of the upper classes and so when there's a free market you know what you have
[02:44:31.560 --> 02:44:36.040]  to do you do this with your show i do this with my show we go out and we try to produce value to
[02:44:36.040 --> 02:44:39.800]  people on a voluntary basis if they don't like us they can just switch us off if they find us
[02:44:39.800 --> 02:44:43.720]  offensive they can turn us off so but we still have to go out there and provide truth on a
[02:44:43.720 --> 02:44:47.880]  voluntary basis but if you're a politician everyone's going to listen to you because you're in charge
[02:44:47.880 --> 02:44:52.920]  of all the weaponry in the known universe and beyond so when you have a truly free market all of the
[02:44:52.920 --> 02:44:57.000]  verbally adept sociopathic busy busy bodies who want to tell everyone else what to do
[02:44:57.640 --> 02:45:01.960]  can't really do it because they can try and boss you around you like kick turn them off don't care
[02:45:01.960 --> 02:45:07.240]  and so these kinds of people can't really adapt to the free market they want to retain the power
[02:45:07.240 --> 02:45:12.520]  the political power to push everyone around and uh you know the endless interfering busy
[02:45:12.520 --> 02:45:17.720]  bodies of the human race would have precious little to do without the state and that's one
[02:45:17.720 --> 02:45:21.960]  of the reasons why they like the state it gives them this massive platform to move us all around
[02:45:21.960 --> 02:45:25.240]  like the little pawns like the little ants like the livestock that they think we are
[02:45:25.960 --> 02:45:29.560]  the tragedy is they can only do it with our fundamental consent that's right and
[02:45:30.200 --> 02:45:35.320]  it literally becomes an ether in which unnatural people that no one would want to associate with
[02:45:35.320 --> 02:45:41.000]  can now attain power and success instead of the natural virtuous way whoever is the most hard
[02:45:41.000 --> 02:45:46.200]  working the most loving the most creative the most beautiful the most honorable becomes the
[02:45:46.200 --> 02:45:51.880]  example of society that others emulate that and you go to alpha centuries and to the next level
[02:45:51.880 --> 02:45:57.000]  of human development but if you go with the who has the most weapons the most thugs the most intimidation
[02:45:57.000 --> 02:46:04.040]  the best bs you build systems of bs toward the public then mimics that civilization collapses
[02:46:04.040 --> 02:46:08.920]  and then it restarts over with virtue again then we become decadent and corrupt the problem is
[02:46:08.920 --> 02:46:13.240]  we can't go to that cycle again because they're going to destroy the planet with the weaponry
[02:46:13.240 --> 02:46:19.720]  this time they must be stopped well i agree with that and and there is this awful thing that that
[02:46:19.720 --> 02:46:25.480]  is fundamental where people say well barack obama or sarcosi or putin or whoever is they
[02:46:25.480 --> 02:46:30.120]  should be in charge they should be telling everyone to what to do they know the way things should be
[02:46:30.120 --> 02:46:37.000]  and i would love to see a world alex where these guys had the power of say an advice column you
[02:46:37.000 --> 02:46:40.840]  know where you could write into these guys and say barack obama how should i deal with my health
[02:46:40.840 --> 02:46:44.440]  care and you say well i as a constitutional law professor i believe that you should do x y y y
[02:46:44.440 --> 02:46:48.840]  whatever right i'd love to just see them have the power of an advice column or you know they'd
[02:46:48.840 --> 02:46:52.600]  have a hotline you'd call them up and say barack i don't really know what to do with 50 percent of
[02:46:52.600 --> 02:46:56.520]  my income what do you think i should do he said well you should spend it on this this this and this
[02:46:56.520 --> 02:47:00.760]  that's what i want they don't have the power to compel our obedience but they actually have to
[02:47:00.760 --> 02:47:06.760]  win us over with reason and evidence wouldn't that be a beautiful world exactly instead they blow
[02:47:06.760 --> 02:47:10.920]  stuff up or let people blow stuff up and then fair monger until we give up all of our rights let me
[02:47:10.920 --> 02:47:17.160]  ask you this when we go to phone calls where do you step on malinu where do you think this battle
[02:47:17.160 --> 02:47:23.080]  in your gut just as your stalt is going is liberty losing or winning and will the global
[02:47:23.080 --> 02:47:28.120]  world blow stuff up you are gonna you are gonna get uh flex of foam on your webcam because this is
[02:47:28.120 --> 02:47:33.320]  a topic i actually feel quite quite passionate about so i will give you my very very brief
[02:47:33.320 --> 02:47:39.160]  answer to that there is no momentum in history there is no great movements of history that pushes
[02:47:39.160 --> 02:47:43.400]  around we are not pinballs in the endless bumper sorry for your younger audience you'll have to
[02:47:43.400 --> 02:47:47.480]  ask your parents what that means we're not pinballs bumping around the bumpers of some
[02:47:47.480 --> 02:47:53.640]  giant cosmic pinball machine where the world goes is where committed passionate knowledgeable
[02:47:53.640 --> 02:47:59.000]  communicators make it go it's where you make it go it's where i make it go it's where your listeners
[02:47:59.000 --> 02:48:03.480]  make it go in their conversations in their lives where does history go where is the momentum of
[02:48:03.480 --> 02:48:09.480]  human history in the willpower of committed individuals and in no other place uh now it's
[02:48:09.480 --> 02:48:15.000]  true that if committed people of intelligence and integrity and willpower do nothing then yes
[02:48:15.000 --> 02:48:19.720]  the worst tends to overcome the better like if you sit on your couch you get fat or not
[02:48:19.720 --> 02:48:25.640]  leaner and if we do nothing then yes evil wins but all we have to do is get off our butts and
[02:48:25.640 --> 02:48:29.320]  make the world uncomfortable for the compromise which provokes them into thinking like you
[02:48:29.320 --> 02:48:34.280]  sharpen a sword against a spinning sand wheel then we just go and make the world uncomfortable
[02:48:34.280 --> 02:48:38.040]  we push the world where we wanted to go we make the world go where we wanted to go because we
[02:48:38.040 --> 02:48:42.360]  have the better arguments exactly greater evidence and the accumulated evidence of history is
[02:48:42.360 --> 02:48:47.720]  completely on our side i agree and and the status to all say this uh cast sunstein says
[02:48:47.720 --> 02:48:52.360]  we'll infiltrate the alternative media discredit it by acting you know bad putting out racism
[02:48:52.360 --> 02:48:57.080]  disinfo and they say we've got to just keep pushing pushing pushing they even admit in their own
[02:48:57.080 --> 02:49:01.960]  papers oh they all want freedom the average person wants to be a libertarian or beyond
[02:49:01.960 --> 02:49:06.200]  but we've got to act like they're all alone we've got to just just dominate them whip them
[02:49:06.200 --> 02:49:11.000]  break their will and so the crazy thing is they write all these books like we're not reading them
[02:49:11.000 --> 02:49:15.640]  i think their arrogance is going to undo them so we have to make them uncomfortable everywhere
[02:49:15.640 --> 02:49:20.840]  just like they do us and that's what i do and it's not a tiring thing folks once you start
[02:49:20.840 --> 02:49:27.000]  doing this it's like finally breathing oh i was supposed to do this this is the animating contest
[02:49:27.000 --> 02:49:33.880]  of liberty that that jefferson talked about yes and don't you remember when you were a kid and you
[02:49:33.880 --> 02:49:38.440]  did something bad or did something wrong which basically meant you disagreed with the authority
[02:49:38.440 --> 02:49:42.280]  and ease of the powers that be in your school or wherever what would they say to you they would say
[02:49:42.920 --> 02:49:48.040]  alex jones young alex jones this is going to go on your permanent record and those words were like
[02:49:48.040 --> 02:49:51.720]  oh my goodness it's going to be tattooed on my forehead and so on and now of course we all have
[02:49:51.720 --> 02:49:56.120]  a genuine permanent record called everything we ever do on the internet or in a bank machine or
[02:49:56.120 --> 02:50:01.000]  using our credit card through the nsa and what is it done it has done fundamentally nothing to us
[02:50:01.000 --> 02:50:06.120]  other than give us more ammunition to push back against this encroaching tyranny exactly call
[02:50:06.120 --> 02:50:13.240]  their bluff double down on life get crazed i mean humans are meant to be wild and full of life and
[02:50:14.040 --> 02:50:19.320]  instead of just waddling around wearing sports jerseys you know watching steroid heads push
[02:50:19.320 --> 02:50:23.480]  each other around and grab each other's butts i mean it's just there's so much more in the
[02:50:23.480 --> 02:50:30.600]  universe than watching obama or watching john bainer or or watching uh all these people that's
[02:50:30.600 --> 02:50:35.640]  what i hate is how the status make us look at them make us talk about them even to block them we
[02:50:35.640 --> 02:50:40.440]  need to make them where they're the joke they are do you agree with that yeah look i mean
[02:50:40.440 --> 02:50:44.920]  what what are we as a species how to be evolved we evolved as hunter gatherers now we've all just
[02:50:44.920 --> 02:50:49.960]  kind of thrown the hunter side aside you know and we've just become these gatherers like oh look

[02:54:13.800 --> 02:54:21.480]  we're being hunted by the globalist we're trying to be like sheet
[02:54:24.840 --> 02:54:30.600]  stefan malinu is our guest right now and he was briefly finishing up his point that
[02:54:31.400 --> 02:54:37.320]  we have a predator superclass that trains us to act like absolute victims crank it up here's
[02:54:37.320 --> 02:54:42.200]  a good part right here the message of the new world order that we're not laying down anymore
[02:54:42.200 --> 02:54:53.400]  we're going to hunt down
[02:54:54.440 --> 02:54:58.040]  all right folks let's go back to stephan malinu a little bit overdrive and take these calls
[02:54:58.040 --> 02:55:01.640]  i apologize the callers i've been hogging all the guests today i'm really a bad guy
[02:55:03.880 --> 02:55:05.880]  all right uh stephan finish your point about that
[02:55:05.880 --> 02:55:13.320]  about that oh yeah just that we've we've lost our i think to some degree masculinity bring back
[02:55:13.960 --> 02:55:18.200]  the masculinity bring back the spine we've just become these gatherers looking for the rotten
[02:55:18.200 --> 02:55:23.640]  fruits of power that drip down on our tables and going ah like what a great meal let's go out and
[02:55:23.640 --> 02:55:27.640]  hunt ourselves some freedom it's all language it's all reason it's all evidence there's no weaponry
[02:55:27.640 --> 02:55:32.680]  that's going to set us free because the real prison the real state the real tyranny is in the mind
[02:55:32.680 --> 02:55:36.840]  but we can blow through that stuff with reason and evidence and once you shift into the hunter mode
[02:55:36.840 --> 02:55:42.600]  and bring down a big predator called freedom go ahead sorry no no i agree once we shift into
[02:55:42.600 --> 02:55:47.800]  into hunter mode against the enemy that's combat mode as well they're shifted into that with deceit
[02:55:47.800 --> 02:55:53.480]  we shift into the hunter mode with liberty we're going to kick their butt and we all love combat
[02:55:53.480 --> 02:55:58.920]  are you talking about sports sports is combat well i mean how well do combat movies show
[02:55:58.920 --> 02:56:04.120]  we all love combat it's invigorating the great mistake of course has been to try to get a fight
[02:56:04.120 --> 02:56:08.280]  with with weapons rather than with language rather than with philosophy rather than with reason and
[02:56:08.280 --> 02:56:12.440]  evidence but when you get into that mode it's really invigorating people look at that and say
[02:56:12.440 --> 02:56:17.560]  oh there's so much fighting it's so tense it must be so stressful it's kind of what we're built for
[02:56:17.560 --> 02:56:22.200]  people this is why we're not in the caves this is why we're not jellyfish or amoeba anymore
[02:56:22.200 --> 02:56:27.480]  i mean most of us so i think that it's a really i invite people to take on the combat it's what
[02:56:27.480 --> 02:56:33.400]  andrew break break part used to say walk towards the fire walk towards the fire because if you
[02:56:33.400 --> 02:56:38.600]  run away it's going to catch you only with your back turned absolutely god bless you that's very
[02:56:38.600 --> 02:56:43.880]  well said god bless to the atheism it's a endearing term let's talk to greg and pencil vanya thanks
[02:56:43.880 --> 02:56:49.960]  for holding brother on the air go ahead hello there gentlemen uh like to throw something out there
[02:56:49.960 --> 02:56:57.080]  that nobody has talked about um it would be the farm bill and you know the role in what the farmers
[02:56:57.080 --> 02:57:04.520]  would play in things as they progress and you know i'm a small farmer uh i work i have to work a 50
[02:57:04.520 --> 02:57:10.200]  hour a week job just to keep the farm going and keep everything going and it's just uh i just like
[02:57:10.200 --> 02:57:17.880]  to get your take on the farm bill and or i guess we could call it the food stamp bill and uh what
[02:57:17.880 --> 02:57:22.520]  uh what will be a good what's i'll be honest with you i've read some about it but it's always
[02:57:22.520 --> 02:57:27.000]  changing you're the expert give us your brief take on it then we'll get stuff on stake what
[02:57:27.000 --> 02:57:33.000]  well from what i read it is that basically a food stamp bill 80 percent of it is food stamps and uh
[02:57:33.000 --> 02:57:37.320]  it none of it that i know it helps me a small farmer yeah well that's what they do that they
[02:57:37.320 --> 02:57:41.640]  always get control of the economy and then call it one thing and do another i know this american
[02:57:41.640 --> 02:57:45.960]  farmers were much more prosperous there were more of them before government got involved they're
[02:57:45.960 --> 02:57:51.240]  replacing it with big agra only big agra knows how to get the incentives and the free deals uh let's
[02:57:51.240 --> 02:57:58.040]  get stefan's take on that god bless you great good question well on the right republican the republican
[02:57:58.040 --> 02:58:03.800]  party gets an average donation of about $50 each in other words small farmers can help the republican
[02:58:03.800 --> 02:58:08.600]  party on the left the democratic party has refused to release the size of their average donation
[02:58:08.600 --> 02:58:13.400]  because i'm not even going out on a limb to guess that it's far larger than that because it comes
[02:58:13.400 --> 02:58:17.640]  from a lot of rich elites in the in the media and in the entertainment industry and so on
[02:58:17.640 --> 02:58:22.520]  so one of the problems is the people on the left they want bigger and bigger organizations because
[02:58:22.520 --> 02:58:27.160]  the small people they like to fund parties that are focusing on smaller government free trade
[02:58:27.160 --> 02:58:32.280]  like the republican party so when you get big aggregate groups together uh that tends to benefit
[02:58:32.280 --> 02:58:36.680]  the left and so when you start to give farm subsidies then you start to make it more profitable to
[02:58:36.680 --> 02:58:41.480]  lobby politicians and all that kind of just stay there back in 60 back in 60 final segment
