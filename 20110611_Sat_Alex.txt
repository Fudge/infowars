[00:00:10.796 --> 00:00:26.561]  Welcome to this special broadcast edition of the Alex Jones Show live on this Saturday, 12th June 2011, live at the Bilderberg Hotel, the Sovretta, up on the mountain in Danmurit, Switzerland.
[00:00:38.364 --> 00:00:42.667]  We got the protest scheduled to kick off almost imminently.
[00:00:42.667 --> 00:00:50.893]  We got a ton of information coming up, special guests, all of the Info Warriors, the We Are Changers here on the scene.
[00:00:50.893 --> 00:00:57.397]  It's another rainy day in Switzerland but the spirits are high as the protest kicks into high gear.
[00:00:57.397 --> 00:01:01.099]  Of course, this is a special broadcast of the Alex Jones Show.
[00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:07.624]  We're going to go for about an hour and then we'll be back later on for a second instalment later on in the day.
[00:01:08.368 --> 00:01:09.709]  So we're at Bilderberg 2011.
[00:01:09.709 --> 00:01:19.194]  We're just 100 yards down the road from the Bilderberg Hotel at which the war criminals and the global elite are meeting today.
[00:01:19.194 --> 00:01:21.855]  Of course, massive developments last night.
[00:01:21.855 --> 00:01:27.578]  We had the Swiss politician there in the biggest party in Switzerland, the Swiss People's Party.
[00:01:28.178 --> 00:01:45.106]  Dominic Bettig give a speech and then march down to the Bilderberg Hotel itself and confront the police on the fact that they're protecting people who are committing treason, including supposed representatives of the Swiss people themselves.
[00:01:45.106 --> 00:01:48.067]  So Bettig basically confronted the police.
[00:01:48.067 --> 00:01:51.028]  He had a conversation with them and they wouldn't let him in.
[00:01:51.028 --> 00:01:54.350]  There was talk that he was going to come back this morning, but that wasn't the case.
[00:01:54.850 --> 00:02:03.677]  So now we're joined with the protesters for this resistance movement against Bilderberg as the excitement mounts.
[00:02:03.677 --> 00:02:09.762]  And we're going to hand over to Aaron Dyke to get some of the latest news and intel on the Bilderberg group.
[00:02:09.762 --> 00:02:10.503]  Here's Aaron Dyke.
[00:02:12.392 --> 00:02:13.392]  Thank you, Paul.
[00:02:13.392 --> 00:02:16.654]  So you just mentioned Dominic Fettig trying to walk in.
[00:02:16.654 --> 00:02:21.815]  Of course, Jim Tucker, on the first day, also officially tried to gain entrance.
[00:02:21.815 --> 00:02:29.018]  And he reported that they, as routinely as in the past years, said, no, Mr. Tucker, you can't come in.
[00:02:29.018 --> 00:02:30.479]  They know him by name.
[00:02:30.479 --> 00:02:36.841]  Every year at the conference, no matter where in the world, securities are always well informed about Jim Tucker's movements.
[00:02:37.549 --> 00:02:43.430]  But it's a very healthy sign that we now have members of the Swiss legislature coming and trying to enter.
[00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:59.874]  And that's partially in response to the fact that an Italian EU Parliament member named Mario Borghese also tried to enter into the facility of Bilderberg about a day and a half ago.
[00:03:01.613 --> 00:03:07.598]  And he was not only refused entry, he was pushed down and his nose was blown reportedly.
[00:03:07.598 --> 00:03:21.791]  So just absolutely ridiculous police brutality committed against a member of the EU Parliament, who simply tried to gain entry into the Subretta Hotel, the site of the Bilderberg meeting.
[00:03:21.791 --> 00:03:26.776]  Really just a brazen move of the Bilderberg police state that's surely going to work against them.
[00:03:27.396 --> 00:03:39.619]  And Dominic Becic, in addition to trying to get an entry into the hotel, says he will be looking into the reasons behind that police brutality and trying to get some answers or even an official apology.
[00:03:39.619 --> 00:03:49.221]  Dominic Becic has also, prior to the meeting, written a letter calling for Henry Kissinger's arrest, saying that he shouldn't be allowed into the country.
[00:03:49.221 --> 00:03:55.422]  There is a warrant for Henry Kissinger's arrest in several countries, including France,
[00:03:56.062 --> 00:04:05.066]  And many of these countries also have agreements, of course, to transport criminals, extradite I guess you would call it.
[00:04:05.066 --> 00:04:11.689]  So Henry Kissinger may have had to sneak into this meeting quite covertly and he may make a surprise exit.
[00:04:14.409 --> 00:04:21.056]  Other developments that have happened over the past few days are not directly Bilderberg related, but again related to U.S.
[00:04:21.056 --> 00:04:22.097]  politics.
[00:04:22.097 --> 00:04:33.308]  And that is simply just to recap the fact that Texas Governor Rick Perry, a 2007 Bilderberg attendee, who's been pre-vetted for the presidency, may in fact be running.
[00:04:33.308 --> 00:04:35.410]  He's floating that decision right now.
[00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:36.171]  And the other item,
[00:04:36.591 --> 00:04:39.893]  That Hillary Clinton, quote, wants the World Bank position.
[00:04:39.893 --> 00:04:45.417]  The World Bank position is quite notoriously always held by a Bilderberg member.
[00:04:45.417 --> 00:04:56.905]  The past several heads of the World Bank have included, excuse me, have included Paul Wolfowitz, James Wolfensohn, and also Robert Zoellick.
[00:04:56.905 --> 00:05:05.531]  Also, we reported on the first day of Bilderberg that one of the major decisions going on inside the hotel during the conference here will be the replacement
[00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:10.201]  Two, Dominique Strauss-Kahn at the IMF.
[00:05:10.201 --> 00:05:25.803]  So both of those international bank organizations created under the Bretton Woods Agreement before the end of the World War II will both be updated and those decisions will be made here inside the meeting.
[00:05:25.803 --> 00:05:32.324]  We've actually heard two different names quoted in regards to the IMF presidency.
[00:05:32.324 --> 00:05:34.225]  One is a Mexican official.
[00:05:34.225 --> 00:05:35.545]  Paul, do you have his name handy?
[00:05:38.357 --> 00:05:41.161]  It's on record, we'll have to get back with you on that.
[00:05:41.161 --> 00:05:45.186]  And another is, who was the other person that floated toward the IMF?
[00:05:45.186 --> 00:05:51.214]  I believe it was someone else, also from France, a woman.
[00:05:51.214 --> 00:05:52.877]  Christine Lagarde.
[00:05:52.877 --> 00:05:53.057]  Yeah.
[00:05:54.181 --> 00:06:10.588]  Then, in other news, we've been able to stake out the hotel from multiple angles, and yesterday we filmed a helicopter taking off around midday, and there's some high-quality photos of the aide who handled Doris Lothard.
[00:06:10.588 --> 00:06:20.172]  We believe she took off in a helicopter shortly before Dominique Bettig, both of them Swiss officials, before Dominique Bettig came to ask questions, Doris Lothard.
[00:06:20.892 --> 00:06:22.112]  We're good to go.
[00:06:42.077 --> 00:06:42.517]  We're good to go.
[00:07:01.701 --> 00:07:18.086]  Learn from our sources that we're not on the official list, which of course we leaked yesterday and put on InfoWars.com, which was also carried by DrugsReport.com, include Bill Gates, who we tentatively identified on the first day, but we're not able to confirm until today.
[00:07:18.086 --> 00:07:26.909]  But in fact, Jim Tucker and other inside Bilderberg sources have confirmed that Bill Gates, head of Microsoft, and of course the
[00:07:28.950 --> 00:07:36.252]  Very conspiratorial Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation is here at the Bilderberg meeting in 2011.
[00:07:36.252 --> 00:07:44.575]  There's another Gates here and this may be an even bigger story and another kind of treason and that is outgoing Secretary of Defense Robert Gates
[00:07:44.995 --> 00:07:53.397]  But of course, he's still holding that position, but according to Tucker and other inside sources, he is here inside the Bilderberg meeting, but not on the official list.
[00:07:53.397 --> 00:07:59.418]  The reason for that is quite clear, because the Logan Act specifically forbids official U.S.
[00:07:59.418 --> 00:08:07.860]  personnel from meeting in secret with foreign dignitaries, foreign officials, and he could be fined and should also be punished.
[00:08:08.659 --> 00:08:09.160]  I think so.
[00:08:27.307 --> 00:08:29.429]  The Spanish Prime Minister, that is.
[00:08:29.429 --> 00:08:32.853]  And he, too, is inside the meeting, but not on the official list.
[00:08:32.853 --> 00:08:35.215]  Quite possibly for similar reasons.
[00:08:35.215 --> 00:08:43.203]  One more name not on the list we were able to confirm through photographic evidence, which we also captured on the first day, is Andes, or Andres?
[00:08:45.709 --> 00:08:47.031]  I'm not joking about that.
[00:08:47.031 --> 00:08:47.852]  We've got some
[00:09:08.113 --> 00:09:27.534]  Really incredible inside sources really bombshell Just dark information and we're waiting on one of our sources to get back to us with an update, but we will surely Be dropping that information coming up shortly here in this special broadcast live on Saturday, June 11 right now I'm gonna hand the phone back to Paul Joseph Watson
[00:09:29.201 --> 00:09:33.407]  We're here live at the Bilderberg 2011 protest in St.
[00:09:33.407 --> 00:09:38.393]  Moritz, just outside the Sobretta Hotel, where the Global Elite are meeting.
[00:09:38.393 --> 00:09:40.055]  Of course, they're going to go home tomorrow.
[00:09:40.055 --> 00:09:44.942]  We're going to be catching all the video and the photographs as they leave, hopefully getting some more snapshots.
[00:09:45.522 --> 00:09:57.870]  Like Aaron was talking about earlier, we went up on a different location behind the hotel and we were actually able to walk into the field onto the hill which sits directly level with the hotel.
[00:09:57.870 --> 00:10:01.813]  You get a really close vantage point from this position.
[00:10:01.813 --> 00:10:14.681]  And basically we saw what turned out to be a Swiss military helicopter preparing to take off, which is obviously key because that helicopter is paid for by Swiss taxpayers, which of course
[00:10:15.772 --> 00:10:26.279]  It brings into the spotlight this whole issue regarding Doris Lauter because she's the Swiss federal government official.
[00:10:26.279 --> 00:10:34.945]  It was announced in the newspaper days ago that she would be attending Bilderberg and from a Doomlen snapshot that we later received
[00:10:35.525 --> 00:10:52.750]  Um, there's an image of Doris Lotard leaving yesterday afternoon, and she's accompanied by an aide who we also separately captured on photograph right before this helicopter took off and flew over the mountains, which all points to the fact that Lotard
[00:10:53.663 --> 00:10:53.903]  I don't
[00:11:08.602 --> 00:11:17.865]  One of the treasonous individuals that has broken Swiss laws to attend this meeting and speak with representatives of foreign countries.
[00:11:17.865 --> 00:11:30.208]  Now, we were talking to the aide of Dominique Beitig last night at the event, which many of you will have seen on JustinTV, and he gave us the actual Swiss laws, which are the equivalent to the Logan Act in the United States.
[00:11:30.208 --> 00:11:35.030]  Of course, the Logan Act states that no US politician in a position of power can meet
[00:11:35.610 --> 00:11:35.971]  We're good.
[00:11:47.347 --> 00:11:50.449]  Basically, they're the direct equivalent to the Logan Act.
[00:11:50.449 --> 00:12:00.833]  So the fact that Lothard attended that the military helicopter that flew her out was paid for by Swiss taxpayers directly implicates her in treason.
[00:12:00.833 --> 00:12:08.577]  And we've talked to numerous individuals that are now actively pursuing a legal case, certainly against her and maybe other Bilderberg members.
[00:12:09.764 --> 00:12:18.892]  But you've got to forgive us today for being a little bit dingy because we were literally up until 5am and for very good reason of course.
[00:12:18.892 --> 00:12:33.685]  You know that Jim Tucker routinely gets the most bombshell inside information from basically just talking to people who are staff at the hotel who have had access to the Bilderberg Group in positions such as waiters, bartenders, people like that.
[00:12:35.060 --> 00:12:41.064]  What Aaron mentioned earlier is literally probably the biggest story to come out of Bilderberg this year.
[00:12:41.064 --> 00:12:44.607]  Aaron, you introduce it and then I'll add some further details.
[00:12:47.026 --> 00:12:50.669]  Well again, Paul, we were at one of the hotel's bars.
[00:12:50.669 --> 00:12:58.454]  I won't name the hotel for the protection of all of us as this story is still breaking and who knows who it's going to anger.
[00:12:58.454 --> 00:13:07.539]  But we did contact a source who is very closely, very intimately connected with one or more of these Bilderberg members.
[00:13:07.539 --> 00:13:11.262]  Paul, are you ready to break this story or are we waiting on our source to get back to us?
[00:13:15.342 --> 00:13:23.807]  Well, Paul, I want you to hit this, because I don't want to screw up the details here, because it's very bombshell information, obviously.
[00:13:23.807 --> 00:13:28.511]  Yeah, we've got to tread very, very carefully on this, because it's not even fleshed out.
[00:13:28.511 --> 00:13:38.937]  Obviously, this is not confirmed, but... Basically, after the march last night, it was about midnight before Dominic Batig actually did the confrontation with the police here.
[00:13:38.937 --> 00:13:44.281]  So, he jumped into the car to head back to the hotel at about half past midnight.
[00:13:44.281 --> 00:13:44.601]  And then...
[00:13:45.379 --> 00:13:45.659]  We're good.
[00:14:04.807 --> 00:14:09.689]  Which was something like Prostitute Service Mogul at Bohemian Grove.
[00:14:09.689 --> 00:14:18.474]  And of course we know that they like to put in male prostitutes at Bohemian Grove to satisfy their assorted deviant pleasures.
[00:14:18.474 --> 00:14:21.475]  And back to what happened last night in relation to this.
[00:14:21.475 --> 00:14:31.200]  Basically, we got talking to the bar staff there and it turned out that one of them told us he had a very important job to attend at 9.30 the next morning.
[00:14:32.111 --> 00:14:40.437]  And it soon became apparent that that job was providing a certain kind of service to members of the global elite.
[00:14:40.437 --> 00:14:47.242]  The venue he named was actually very close to the Sobretta Hotel just up the mountain.
[00:14:47.242 --> 00:14:54.668]  And we were gradually trying to tease this information out of him because he was very, very reticent to give us any direct details.
[00:14:54.668 --> 00:15:00.892]  But of course, how we work these people is to, you know, give them another drink one after the other, which is why we were there until 5am.
[00:15:02.296 --> 00:15:11.438]  And basically, although we're waiting to confirm this and we're going to talk with Alex from Info Creek because he's got more information on it.
[00:15:11.438 --> 00:15:27.741]  It appears as if this individual was preparing to fly out at 9.30 this morning to a location near the Bilderberg Hotel to provide a certain service to Bilderberg members that goes beyond serving them food and drink.
[00:15:28.556 --> 00:15:35.383]  Now, this is an individual that, from his behaviour, from his mannerisms, obviously suggested that he was gay.
[00:15:35.383 --> 00:15:45.954]  And the fact that he was planning to go on this mission, which he suggested he would be transported there via helicopter, suggests that his role is exactly what it suggests.
[00:15:46.454 --> 00:15:53.018]  And we're going to be talking to Alex from Info Creek in a moment to try and get more details on this.
[00:15:53.018 --> 00:15:57.021]  So this could be the biggest story out of Bilderberg 2011.
[00:15:57.021 --> 00:16:01.944]  So we're feverishly trying to fill in the blanks, Aaron Dyke.
[00:16:01.944 --> 00:16:10.509]  Paul, just to put it in greater context, we know of course that the Bohemian Grove meetings, they routinely fly in primarily male prostitutes.
[00:16:10.509 --> 00:16:14.612]  They also fly in some female prostitutes, but the prevailing
[00:16:15.453 --> 00:16:32.218]  Okay, we've got a bullhorn on the hill over here, and let me just cut into my own report and say that we do have pretty good numbers, maybe only about 100, but very active activists out here who really have a lot of signs and want the Bilderbergs to know what they think.
[00:16:32.218 --> 00:16:40.701]  We have, by the way, seen quite a few of their Bilderberg limos still arriving, even today, going in and out of the meetings, transporting the members.
[00:16:40.701 --> 00:16:42.041]  We're not exactly sure.
[00:16:42.041 --> 00:16:44.162]  But to get back to this bombshell information,
[00:16:45.646 --> 00:17:00.080]  Regarding a source that we've contacted in a hotel here in the area, again, Bohemian Grove and these other exclusive retreats, we know that male prostitutes are routinely shipped in, some female, but the prevailing
[00:17:02.398 --> 00:17:12.507]  Preference would be for male escorts, and that's also true of Jeff Gannon, who's admittedly connected to the White House, and so forth.
[00:17:12.507 --> 00:17:21.074]  So, we know these elitists do have these kind of tastes, and it's not really a surprise that we would find a source like that.
[00:17:21.074 --> 00:17:23.476]  It's just also a matter of luck.
[00:17:23.476 --> 00:17:27.740]  And, Paul, you've gone down the hill.
[00:17:27.740 --> 00:17:29.101]  Would you like to add anything on that?
[00:17:33.452 --> 00:17:37.699]  Sure, I'm going to pass the phone right now to John of We Are Change Birmingham.
[00:17:37.699 --> 00:17:43.028]  He's been here with exclusive video and also talking to sources, helping us gather information.
[00:17:43.028 --> 00:17:44.431]  I'm going to pass the phone to him for a minute.
[00:17:46.448 --> 00:17:47.348]  Thanks Aaron.
[00:17:47.348 --> 00:18:02.916]  Yeah, last night we were in a couple of bars in Tamaritz, in the town here, in the village, and we got some information that possibly somebody was going to be working today at one of the Bilderberg meetings, possibly serving food or drink.
[00:18:02.916 --> 00:18:08.539]  Later on it became apparent that actually he wasn't going to be just serving food or drink, he was going to be serving something totally different.
[00:18:10.623 --> 00:18:12.164]  Obviously, that was quite a shock to us.
[00:18:12.164 --> 00:18:20.507]  We didn't really think that we would come across, you know, somebody who was admitting to us that he was a male prostitute.
[00:18:20.507 --> 00:18:22.668]  And he was obviously very cakey then.
[00:18:22.668 --> 00:18:25.649]  He sort of said, no, I can't talk about it.
[00:18:25.649 --> 00:18:30.712]  We sort of said, look, we'll give you some money, tell us something, you know, anything that comes out of there is really important.
[00:18:30.712 --> 00:18:35.574]  You know, listen to what these guys are talking about, because any of this stuff could affect the world.
[00:18:36.957 --> 00:18:37.418]  I think so.
[00:18:52.662 --> 00:18:58.726]  So yeah, we got some new intel and it's supposed to be a small, very beautiful, very posh town.
[00:19:22.034 --> 00:19:22.675]  We're good to go.
[00:19:40.740 --> 00:19:43.962]  They came here on a very, very tight schedule.
[00:19:43.962 --> 00:19:52.426]  So we're asking ourselves, why do some of these Bilderbergers seclude themselves from other Bilderbergers to go to that place?
[00:19:52.426 --> 00:20:03.312]  Because if it's just for fun, you know, we're asking ourselves, don't they understand they have a very tight schedule and they can't waste any time because they have to figure out how to kill the free internet and they put up these timetables.
[00:20:03.312 --> 00:20:04.672]  So they're very busy.
[00:20:04.672 --> 00:20:08.154]  It's a very, very weird situation we're dealing with here.
[00:20:14.122 --> 00:20:16.825]  Oh yeah, of course.
[00:20:16.825 --> 00:20:25.675]  There's some people, locals, they're always hired when these meetings take place and they're being security checked, triple checked.
[00:20:25.675 --> 00:20:30.480]  We heard some stories about how that all goes down.
[00:20:30.480 --> 00:20:32.442]  Very, very high level of security.
[00:20:32.442 --> 00:20:33.944]  I mean, even I was surprised.
[00:20:35.010 --> 00:20:36.352]  We're good to go.
[00:20:52.309 --> 00:20:56.913]  And of course, that would mean, that would be a very, very important talk.
[00:20:56.913 --> 00:21:06.200]  If we can spot people, if we can follow maybe a helicopter or the cars, if we can drive to that place, because I think we know exactly where it is.
[00:21:06.200 --> 00:21:19.371]  If we can see faces, get faced on camera, we would maybe get a clearer picture of why they went there, who went there, and kind of deduct from that what they're talking about there, what they're doing up there.
[00:21:21.631 --> 00:21:23.051]  Thank you very much, Alex.
[00:21:23.051 --> 00:21:28.952]  And obviously, we are going to be trying to contact that source later and get more information from him.
[00:21:28.952 --> 00:21:31.713]  But he was rather reluctant to speak to us.
[00:21:31.713 --> 00:21:41.835]  And as Paul mentioned, it took the course of several drinks to draw out more information regarding a possible male escort for one of the Bilderberg members.
[00:21:41.835 --> 00:21:48.616]  And obviously, we cannot disclose the exact location for the protection of ourselves, the reporters, and the source.
[00:21:49.296 --> 00:21:50.697]  We don't want to put anyone in danger.
[00:21:50.697 --> 00:21:54.719]  This is really serious business and these are the big boys who don't play games.
[00:21:54.719 --> 00:22:02.382]  They're not afraid to neutralize leaks and sources and potential moles if they identify them.
[00:22:02.382 --> 00:22:06.264]  So this is very serious stuff and we don't want to play any games with that.
[00:22:07.314 --> 00:22:18.466]  Now, we might shift gears altogether and talk about another very bombshell Bilderberg source that's been lying in plain sight for about the past year.
[00:22:18.466 --> 00:22:23.571]  There's the official site, BilderbergMeetings.org, and although they don't disclose
[00:22:24.091 --> 00:22:25.833]  An awful lot of information.
[00:22:25.833 --> 00:22:39.005]  They do now list a series of topics, very euphemistically titled, academic language, you know, it sounds very proper and everything, but there are clues in there as to some of their inner dealings.
[00:22:39.005 --> 00:22:39.426]  Let me just...
[00:22:40.737 --> 00:22:48.921]  Give you some of the information from last year's conference, which was June 3 through 6, 2010, in Sitka, Spain.
[00:22:48.921 --> 00:22:51.403]  Just a few hours train ride from here in St.
[00:22:51.403 --> 00:22:55.645]  Moritz, Switzerland, the site of the 2011 meeting.
[00:22:55.645 --> 00:23:04.410]  In 2010, in Sitka, Spain, Bilderberg admits themselves that they discussed current events, North Korea, Iran, and non-proliferation.
[00:23:05.161 --> 00:23:06.522]  Proliferation.
[00:23:06.522 --> 00:23:07.823]  Global cooling.
[00:23:07.823 --> 00:23:11.325]  Implications of slow economic growth.
[00:23:11.325 --> 00:23:16.948]  Kind of a tongue-in-cheek reference to global warming shifting to other paradigms.
[00:23:16.948 --> 00:23:25.614]  As the economic growth continues to slow, of course, many of the carbon tax measures are designed to do just that, shut down the economy.
[00:23:25.614 --> 00:23:29.516]  So a potential interpretation of that agenda meeting item from 2010.
[00:23:29.516 --> 00:23:30.196]  Also from the 2010 meeting,
[00:23:33.158 --> 00:23:36.842]  We know that there was the growing influence of cyber technology.
[00:23:36.842 --> 00:23:38.324]  This is going to be a very important point.
[00:23:38.324 --> 00:23:39.925]  I'll get back to that in a moment.
[00:23:39.925 --> 00:23:42.428]  The growing influence of cyber technology.
[00:23:42.428 --> 00:23:45.351]  Also, is financial reform progressing?
[00:23:45.351 --> 00:23:49.916]  In other words, are the world government Bilderberg elitists going to get in?
[00:23:50.396 --> 00:23:50.917]  I think so.
[00:24:06.252 --> 00:24:17.799]  That though they hope to bring in some very serious world government economic control measures, they also knew that these measures were extremely unpopular with the people of Europe.
[00:24:17.799 --> 00:24:29.225]  We've seen evidence of that, obviously, from all the austerity protests in the various countries across Europe, most recently in Spain, also in Solidarity France.
[00:24:29.225 --> 00:24:34.188]  Luke Rudowsky of We Are Change, of course, has been reporting on that, as he was just over there last week.
[00:24:34.918 --> 00:24:41.781]  Also, from the 2010 CEDCA Spain meeting, again from the official Bilderberg disclosed topics, U.S.
[00:24:41.781 --> 00:24:44.822]  and European fiscal and financial challenges.
[00:24:44.822 --> 00:24:47.903]  Also, the European Union and the crisis of the euro.
[00:24:47.903 --> 00:24:50.584]  The European Union and the crisis of the euro.
[00:24:50.584 --> 00:24:54.645]  This very much fits in to the fact that they're meeting here in Switzerland.
[00:24:54.645 --> 00:24:59.427]  Tucker and other inside sources have already suggested, as well as Dominic Betic,
[00:24:59.947 --> 00:25:10.535]  That one of the agenda items they would like to achieve is coaxing Switzerland into accepting the euro and into joining the European Union.
[00:25:10.535 --> 00:25:13.737]  But of course, they are a very proud, very sovereign country.
[00:25:13.737 --> 00:25:15.858]  They have no interest in doing that.
[00:25:15.858 --> 00:25:21.002]  They have an extremely strong currency here of their own, the Swiss franc.
[00:25:21.002 --> 00:25:27.306]  And they have one of the highest living standards anywhere in the entire world, higher even than in the US.
[00:25:28.747 --> 00:25:29.287]  We're good to go.
[00:25:50.129 --> 00:25:50.549]  We're good to go.
[00:26:16.367 --> 00:26:31.788]  Uh, we know that Bill Gates has been to Bilderberg several times over the past years and we've just learned today from our inside sources that Bill Gates of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, uh, one of the mega billion dollar foundations funding vaccines, uh, you know,
[00:26:32.428 --> 00:26:33.088]  We're good to go.
[00:26:57.379 --> 00:26:58.139]  We're good to go.
[00:27:17.509 --> 00:27:18.289]  We're good to go.
[00:27:44.715 --> 00:27:48.602]  If not simply many of the other countries there in the Middle East.
[00:27:48.602 --> 00:27:54.132]  We've seen obviously quite a bit of protesting, spouts of violence and
[00:27:55.327 --> 00:28:00.689]  Various changes of dictators and heads of state over the past several years.
[00:28:00.689 --> 00:28:03.650]  That's something really to take a look at.
[00:28:03.650 --> 00:28:06.451]  We know that Hillary Clinton and other U.S.
[00:28:06.451 --> 00:28:19.016]  officials have been involved in coaching and training and fielding a lot of these social networking revolutionaries there in Egypt and in Iran and the other countries.
[00:28:19.016 --> 00:28:24.478]  And this is fairly significant because there are quite a lot of high-tech Bilderberg members
[00:28:25.078 --> 00:28:25.539]  We're good to go.
[00:28:39.975 --> 00:28:56.624]  The CEO's of Facebook coming here, Craig Mundy and Bill Gates of Microsoft coming here, Peter Thiel of the Bilderberg Steering Group, one of the major financiers of Facebook, also a hedge fund manager, and the CEO of PayPal.
[00:28:56.624 --> 00:29:01.367]  Of course, we also have the various intelligence agencies, the CIA, the NSA, and others.
[00:29:01.927 --> 00:29:05.309]  All working on these new revolutionary platforms.
[00:29:05.309 --> 00:29:06.510]  That's only a few of the members.
[00:29:06.510 --> 00:29:10.212]  There's quite a few involved in high-tech and new areas of online.
[00:29:10.212 --> 00:29:12.694]  So I think that's really an area to watch.
[00:29:12.694 --> 00:29:19.278]  There's a lot more on BilderbergMeetings.org, a real insider source lying in plain sight.
[00:29:19.278 --> 00:29:22.760]  I won't go through it all now, but I thought I would just cover that much of it.
[00:29:22.760 --> 00:29:25.662]  I'm going to turn you back over now to Paul Joseph Watson.
[00:29:27.216 --> 00:29:33.379]  We're here live at Bilderberg 2011, protest day on this Saturday.
[00:29:33.379 --> 00:29:39.561]  As we broke earlier, the bombshell news about the potential male escort servicing the Bilderberg mobiles.
[00:29:39.561 --> 00:29:46.284]  We're going to try and dig up more information on that, because obviously that could be the biggest story to come out of this conference.
[00:29:47.104 --> 00:30:01.434]  Just beforehand Aaron was talking about the attendee list and specifically the people who did not appear on the official list but actually from Jim Tucker's routinely accurate inside sources later emerged were at the conference.
[00:30:01.434 --> 00:30:03.475]  One of course is Anders Rasmussen now.
[00:30:04.312 --> 00:30:19.337]  On the very first day we photographed Anders Rasmussen and we were almost immediately able to confirm his presence, which of course ties into the revelation that they're planning to expand the war in Libya beyond the end of the year.
[00:30:19.337 --> 00:30:21.177]  The cost of the war is already at $750 million.
[00:30:24.318 --> 00:30:25.459]  We're going to go to some music now.
[00:30:25.459 --> 00:30:31.925]  We're going to come back with interviews with activists here at the Bilderberg 2011 protest.
[00:30:31.925 --> 00:30:33.206]  It's the Alex Jones Show live.
[00:30:33.206 --> 00:30:33.586]  Stay tuned.
[00:30:33.586 --> 00:30:34.947]  We're going to go to some music now.
[00:30:58.577 --> 00:30:59.718]  We're good.
[00:33:11.861 --> 00:33:15.663]  We're good to go.
[00:34:00.560 --> 00:34:13.688]  Back live on the Alex Jones Show special broadcast edition live from Samaritz, Switzerland site of the 2011 Bilderberg meeting here at the Sovretta Hotel.
[00:34:13.688 --> 00:34:22.493]  We were going through the attendee list before another subject that we need to cover is the presence of the Chancellor of the Exchequer of Great Britain, a man named George
[00:34:22.873 --> 00:34:23.373]  Thanks Paul.
[00:34:46.570 --> 00:34:58.760]  Yeah, yesterday somebody realised that obviously George Osborne was present and that as a British citizen we would obviously possibly be paying for his presence here.
[00:34:58.760 --> 00:35:04.605]  So a few phone calls were made to the Conservative Party, to his offices.
[00:35:04.605 --> 00:35:06.986]  They initially didn't know where he was for the weekend.
[00:35:06.986 --> 00:35:08.748]  They'd never heard of the Bilderberg Group.
[00:35:09.569 --> 00:35:25.987]  They were very sketchy as to where he was, but after numerous, numerous phone calls they did get back to our source and did inform us that yes, he was obviously here, and he was here as the British Chancellor acting as the Chancellor of the Exchequer.
[00:35:27.799 --> 00:35:41.044]  The fact that there are not just military but large CEOs of corporations meeting with the Chancellor of the Exchequer of the United Kingdom is obviously quite worrying for, well, would be worrying for many Brits.
[00:35:41.044 --> 00:35:46.286]  So really the point is that they are
[00:35:47.552 --> 00:36:04.699]  Covering the fact that they are here and saying, yes, I'm here as the British Chancellor of the Exchequer, but they are not saying who paid for them to get here, where the funding was, you know, whether they were supposed to be doing something else here and obviously what the minutes are.
[00:36:04.699 --> 00:36:10.541]  And as the British Chancellor of the Exchequer, they should be giving detailed reports on what is discussed.
[00:36:10.541 --> 00:36:16.023]  And obviously, as most of the listeners know, there are no reports that come out of Bilderberg unless they are a leak.
[00:36:17.596 --> 00:36:41.083]  I have another source, Tony Cosling, who said that there was a little bit of a coincidence or a similarity between an 18th century group called the Hellfire Club and apparently the Chancellor of the Exchequer was actually cut out of the government after one year, was kicked out because of the unpopular cuts that were put into place.
[00:36:41.523 --> 00:36:58.836]  And what Tony was just recently saying to me was that it was quite possible that Mr Osborne is actually being set up to obviously take the rap for the austerity cuts in the UK that obviously the bankers have engineered probably a few years ago at the Bilderberg meeting.
[00:36:58.836 --> 00:37:06.982]  And yeah, this Hellfire Club apparently was a similar organisation to the Bilderberg Group but in the 18th century.
[00:37:06.982 --> 00:37:08.723]  So I thought it was worth mentioning that.
[00:37:11.104 --> 00:37:17.089]  I'll pass you back to Paul Watson.
[00:37:17.089 --> 00:37:26.637]  We are Change Birmingham, talking about the attendance of the Chancellor of the Exchequer in Britain, George Osborne, at the 2011 Bilderberg meeting.
[00:37:26.637 --> 00:37:32.622]  Obviously another message story to come out of the conference was an incident that happened late on Thursday, a couple of days ago.
[00:37:32.622 --> 00:37:37.787]  Here's the headline from The Local, which is one of Switzerland's biggest news websites.
[00:37:38.497 --> 00:37:42.459]  MEP bloodied sneaking into Bilderberg Hotel.
[00:37:42.459 --> 00:37:53.226]  Italian MEP Mario Borgheseo was reportedly given bloody nose on Thursday as he attempted to sneak into the secretive Bilderberg Conference in San Marino.
[00:37:53.226 --> 00:38:04.172]  Borgheseo right-wing Italian party Leganord was reportedly with another Italian as he attempted to infiltrate the luxury Sobretta House Hotel where the conference is taking place.
[00:38:05.569 --> 00:38:15.574]  And it says Borghese was blocked by guards from the security firm Securitas, that's the organization with the all-seeing eye as their logo, who then called in the Swiss police.
[00:38:15.574 --> 00:38:20.596]  After having their identities checked, the two Italians were told they could not enter the building.
[00:38:21.156 --> 00:38:28.565]  But according to the Italian news agency ANSA, Borghese's nose was bloodied during the altercation with the security guards.
[00:38:28.565 --> 00:38:32.289]  He told the agency he intends to press charges.
[00:38:32.289 --> 00:38:36.114]  So we actually have an allegation of the security guards here at Bilderberg.
[00:38:36.554 --> 00:38:43.697]  Assaulting an Italian member of the European Parliament to ask if he could enter the elite compound.
[00:38:43.697 --> 00:38:48.519]  Of course, we had Dominic Betsy yesterday, who basically did the same thing as Borghese.
[00:38:48.519 --> 00:38:54.682]  He wasn't met with such a violent response, mainly because there were about 200 camp trains on the incident.
[00:38:54.682 --> 00:39:03.306]  And of course, they'd known about it in advance because it was announced earlier in the day that that would happen.
[00:39:03.306 --> 00:39:05.027]  So we're going to talk to more activists here.
[00:39:05.655 --> 00:39:11.917]  We've got a big crowd for this noon Bilderberg 2011 protest.
[00:39:11.917 --> 00:39:17.359]  For Saturday, the Bilderberg members are going to be leaving tomorrow, so we're going to be getting all the footage.
[00:39:17.359 --> 00:39:22.941]  And we're going to shortly hand back Darren Dykes to host the rest of the show.
[00:39:22.941 --> 00:39:30.404]  We're going to run until about the top of the hour, and then we're going to come back with the broadcast later on this evening.
[00:39:30.404 --> 00:39:32.525]  We'll announce the time for that shortly.
[00:39:34.232 --> 00:39:37.357]  We're here at Filberg 2011 process.
[00:39:37.357 --> 00:39:42.946]  Going to hand back now to Aaron Dykes for more on the latest information coming out from the elitist contract with Aaron Dykes.
[00:39:44.666 --> 00:39:52.814]  Paul, I haven't even told you about this, but we actually have another bombshell inside source, which obviously I can't get full details on.
[00:39:52.814 --> 00:40:01.241]  One of the activists here, obviously I'm not going to name him, has a personal relationship with the manager of the hotel.
[00:40:01.241 --> 00:40:04.484]  He's been trying to contact him over the past several days.
[00:40:05.264 --> 00:40:07.825]  That is the manager of the Subrata Hotel.
[00:40:07.825 --> 00:40:19.109]  He hasn't been able to reach him yet, but perhaps after the conference is over, he may get him to speak on certain topics, or we don't know yet if he'll disclose any information at all.
[00:40:19.109 --> 00:40:26.452]  But in past years, Tucker has absolutely relied on hotel employees and personnel for leaks about the agenda.
[00:40:27.172 --> 00:40:35.995]  Um, in the past, uh, the list has been gone by various maids and, uh, hotel clerks who found it in the trash can and pulled it out and handed it to Tucker.
[00:40:35.995 --> 00:40:39.716]  Uh, so, we don't know yet if this source will develop anything at all.
[00:40:39.716 --> 00:40:44.878]  There's another potential bombshell source from directly inside the Gibraltar Hotel.
[00:40:44.878 --> 00:40:49.740]  Obviously not a member of the Goldeberg meetings, but one of the hotel managers, I'm not sure if there's...
[00:40:50.440 --> 00:40:54.582]  Uh, kind of a chain of command on the staff or if there's multiple managers.
[00:40:54.582 --> 00:40:59.304]  Uh, we don't have a name at this time and I'm not sure if we should disclose it at any rate.
[00:40:59.304 --> 00:41:03.646]  Uh, but we will get back to you if that source develops any bombshell information.
[00:41:03.646 --> 00:41:09.549]  Uh, just getting back to the fact that people have shown up, uh, to protest Bilderberg.
[00:41:09.549 --> 00:41:12.030]  Uh, the numbers are beginning to climb here on the Hill.
[00:41:12.030 --> 00:41:16.932]  People are spread out, uh, in a festival or almost kind of woodstock of the people.
[00:41:17.532 --> 00:41:18.354]  We're good to go.
[00:41:32.978 --> 00:41:36.741]  Mr. Burns from The Simpsons is one of the Bilderberg meetings.
[00:41:36.741 --> 00:41:41.665]  Mr. Burns, of course, is a really profound caricature of David Rockefeller.
[00:41:41.665 --> 00:41:46.909]  They're always using various schemes to prolong his life and exploit his wealth.
[00:41:46.909 --> 00:41:53.414]  And I believe, I could be wrong about this, but I recall a number of Simpsons episodes where they referred to the character
[00:41:53.994 --> 00:41:59.936]  Mr. Burns being a Yalie, well certainly a Yalie, and possibly even a Skull and Bones member.
[00:41:59.936 --> 00:42:05.599]  That's not the case for David Rockefeller, but Mr. Burns is sort of a composite.
[00:42:05.599 --> 00:42:11.281]  The only reason I mention that is because he was on the sign for Bilderberg to get out, and it's kind of an interesting way to get the message out.
[00:42:12.602 --> 00:42:19.750]  You know, the numbers are not the kind of thing you would see at a mass demonstration, but it is the people here telling Bilderberg to go home.
[00:42:19.750 --> 00:42:25.355]  We've also received reports that one of the socialist youth groups is planning to protest.
[00:42:25.355 --> 00:42:29.520]  We've not seen any sign of them yet, but perhaps they'll show up later in the day.
[00:42:29.520 --> 00:42:34.045]  It'll be interesting to see exactly what they're here to protest.
[00:42:34.946 --> 00:42:40.433]  I've been talking with various of the activists here, especially those who are based in Switzerland.
[00:42:42.305 --> 00:42:51.852]  One of them had contact with some of these socialist members who kind of mocked and ridiculed the so-called conspiracy theorists here protesting Bilderberg.
[00:42:51.852 --> 00:42:54.754]  But why exactly is it a conspiracy theory?
[00:42:54.754 --> 00:42:55.315]  I don't know.
[00:42:55.315 --> 00:43:01.359]  We know for certain that they are meeting in a cabal fashion, setting the world agenda.
[00:43:01.359 --> 00:43:07.844]  And really, if you want to get right down to it, all these activists are saying is, number one, we need more transparency.
[00:43:07.844 --> 00:43:11.227]  We can't have government and supranational governments
[00:43:11.987 --> 00:43:22.634]  National governments and supranational governments, and various quasi-government entities, as well as some of the most important people in business, meeting in secret.
[00:43:22.634 --> 00:43:31.519]  Even if what they were doing is good, it allows them access to insider trading, first bids, the ability to control new markets, and steer the direction.
[00:43:31.519 --> 00:43:37.883]  And the things happening online is just one of the many aspects of that.
[00:43:39.024 --> 00:43:47.132]  The other thing beyond transparency is obviously a lot of these anti-New World Order protesters clearly object to the globalization.
[00:43:47.132 --> 00:43:53.558]  We touched earlier on how Tucker and others, as well as Dominic Bedeck of the Swiss Parliament,
[00:43:55.177 --> 00:44:04.745]  Broken down the agenda to try to bring Switzerland to its knees, one of the most sovereign and proudly sovereign countries still remaining.
[00:44:04.745 --> 00:44:06.567]  They are not part of the Euro.
[00:44:06.567 --> 00:44:09.650]  They are not part of the European Union at this point in time.
[00:44:09.650 --> 00:44:12.012]  They have a very strong currency value generally.
[00:44:12.892 --> 00:44:14.753]  It is above the dollar.
[00:44:14.753 --> 00:44:17.335]  It's roughly on par with the euro.
[00:44:17.335 --> 00:44:26.280]  They would like to see Switzerland become part of the euro, become part of the European Union, but clearly the people here in Switzerland are very much against that.
[00:44:26.280 --> 00:44:38.808]  They don't want to be victim to the globalization schemes designed right here inside the Bilderberg meeting at the Subreta Hotel in 2011 in just picturesque Swiss Alps.
[00:44:38.808 --> 00:44:41.029]  Paul Watson, have you got anything else to add right now?
[00:44:42.697 --> 00:44:45.579]  Yeah, I mean, talk about picturesque.
[00:44:45.579 --> 00:44:50.063]  The setting for this meeting is in one of the most beautiful places in the world.
[00:44:50.063 --> 00:44:55.487]  Switzerland is probably one of the most scenic and picturesque countries on the planet, if not the number one.
[00:44:55.487 --> 00:45:09.658]  And the fact that these disgusting criminals are disgracing the very name of Switzerland in this very geographical location, which otherwise is stunning, just strikes at the heart of how unwelcome they are here.
[00:45:09.658 --> 00:45:10.559]  Just going over some of the
[00:45:11.235 --> 00:45:14.418]  Latest media coverage of the Bilderberg Group, of course.
[00:45:14.418 --> 00:45:17.381]  We have the BBC article, Bilderberg Mystery.
[00:45:17.381 --> 00:45:20.263]  Why do people believe in cabals?
[00:45:20.263 --> 00:45:30.192]  And the actual image that comes at the top of this story has the Freemason logo, the all-seeing eye, a man dancing on a string.
[00:45:30.192 --> 00:45:34.496]  Ordinary people can only guess at the goings-on at the meetings of the secret Bilderberg Group.
[00:45:35.157 --> 00:45:42.626]  Well, we don't need to guess when we get the leaked inside info, which is bringing together the world's financial and political elite this week.
[00:45:42.626 --> 00:45:46.651]  Conspiracy theories abound as to what is discussed and who is there.
[00:45:46.651 --> 00:45:47.171]  Why?
[00:45:47.171 --> 00:45:48.813]  Asked Tom DeCastello.
[00:45:48.813 --> 00:45:55.241]  Now, even in that opening paragraph, even asking what they're doing, why they're meeting there, is framed as some kind of
[00:45:56.115 --> 00:46:07.422]  Bizarre thing to ask, like it's, you know, it's not normal to be suspicious about 120 of the world's global elite meeting in one place with barely any mainstream media coverage.
[00:46:07.422 --> 00:46:15.587]  Imagine if 200 NBA stars met with referees at some secret location, do you think the media would be interested?
[00:46:15.587 --> 00:46:16.768]  Or, you know, 120 film stars?
[00:46:16.768 --> 00:46:24.633]  So this article is basically trying to frame any belief that Bilderberg has influence or power as
[00:46:26.272 --> 00:46:31.335]  Not just a conspiracy theory, but something that seems quite dangerous to even consider.
[00:46:31.335 --> 00:46:39.059]  They talk about the belief in secret cabals running the world is a hardy perennial.
[00:46:39.059 --> 00:46:42.061]  That's the quote from the article, a hardy perennial.
[00:46:42.061 --> 00:46:52.447]  So they're basically, the whole article is about how merely talking about Bilderberg, merely speculating on what their policy may be, is some kind of fantasy or belief.
[00:46:53.809 --> 00:46:56.030]  Now, I've also got other coverage, of course.
[00:46:56.030 --> 00:47:00.471]  Charlie Skelton's articles in the London Guardian have been excellent, as usual.
[00:47:00.471 --> 00:47:18.277]  Forbes Magazine, CNBC, Baltimore Sun actually was probably the first real American news outlet to break any kind of story on Bilderberg, aside from CNBC, and that came out yesterday again.
[00:47:18.277 --> 00:47:22.539]  Most of the coverage, the news coverage this year, as it has been in recent years, is
[00:47:23.280 --> 00:47:32.544]  Tending towards the neutral, obviously five, ten years ago, we were lucky to get less than a handful of articles about the Bilderberg Group meeting.
[00:47:32.544 --> 00:47:37.647]  But this year we've got a literal deluge, especially in the Swiss media.
[00:47:37.647 --> 00:47:47.011]  In fact, we were looking through the newspapers earlier this morning and there are several new articles right when we arrived at Bilderberg before we even reached St.
[00:47:47.011 --> 00:47:47.371]  Moritz.
[00:47:48.231 --> 00:47:54.917]  We found the newspaper which said that Bilderberg were deciding the success of Strauss-Kahn at the IMF.
[00:47:54.917 --> 00:48:00.261]  So again, anybody who argues that Bilderberg has no power, no influence, is proven wrong yet again.
[00:48:00.261 --> 00:48:04.385]  Now I just want to tell our viewers that
[00:48:05.276 --> 00:48:10.861]  We're going to be doing some very interesting Just In TV streams coming up over the next hour or two.
[00:48:10.861 --> 00:48:21.670]  And of course, not only can you watch the live broadcast of this protest at justin.tv, but all the videos that we do shoot will be archived, so look out for those in the next few hours.
[00:48:21.670 --> 00:48:26.554]  Now, we already shot a couple of Just In TV videos this morning, so be sure to check them out.
[00:48:26.554 --> 00:48:32.479]  Of course, all these videos will be posted on prisonplanet.com and infowars.com.
[00:48:33.325 --> 00:48:46.793]  I'm going to go to another break now, have a short piece of music and we'll come back to wrap up this broadcast and then switch to Justin TV Live for what promises to be a very intriguing next few hours.
[00:48:46.793 --> 00:48:47.474]  Stay tuned.
[00:50:24.699 --> 00:50:48.267]  Just like the Pied Piper Let rats through the streets We dance like marionettes Swaying to the symphony Just like the Pied Piper Let rats through the streets We dance like marionettes Swaying to the symphony
[00:51:27.682 --> 00:51:28.168]  Yeah.
[00:52:07.023 --> 00:52:35.112]  Let rats rule the streets Dance like the marionettes Swaying to the symphony Just like the Pied Piper Let rats rule the streets Dance like the marionettes Swaying to the symphony Swaying to the symphony Of distortion
[00:52:38.467 --> 00:52:50.772]  Okay, we are back on the live special broadcast on Saturday, June 11th outside the Bilderberg Hotel, site of the Bilderberg Meetings 2011, the Chureta Hotel.
[00:52:50.772 --> 00:53:00.337]  Another very interesting tip we've just gained from some of our contacts among the activists and the local people here in Switzerland.
[00:53:00.337 --> 00:53:07.800]  Switzerland, of course, every citizen is part of the civil army, and we have been told that one of the heads
[00:53:08.240 --> 00:53:08.700]  We're good to go.
[00:53:34.825 --> 00:53:35.366]  We're good to go.
[00:53:50.089 --> 00:54:01.437]  Given their authority as the people of Switzerland, that is obviously not confirmed, but we do have that from a source who we know is connected and that will be fleshed out later.
[00:54:01.437 --> 00:54:04.559]  If it develops, we will of course update you on that.
[00:54:04.559 --> 00:54:05.319]  Interesting note.
[00:54:06.661 --> 00:54:14.449]  With just a few minutes to go here, we would kind of hint, Paul Watts has mentioned before, to just keep an eye on the JustinTV feed.
[00:54:14.449 --> 00:54:23.739]  Of course, we've been doing live updates throughout the day for the past several days, since Wednesday the 8th, as we've gained intel, as we've gained
[00:54:24.159 --> 00:54:24.580]  We're good to go.
[00:54:41.862 --> 00:54:48.988]  As I mentioned, we have other citizen activists and locals with people with connections inside the hotel.
[00:54:48.988 --> 00:54:54.092]  We don't know if any of that information would develop, but if it were, it would be very interesting.
[00:54:54.092 --> 00:55:01.398]  And as we dropped early in this very special broadcast, we have also developed a source who may be a
[00:55:02.350 --> 00:55:02.790]  We're good to go.
[00:55:22.170 --> 00:55:26.332]  Do things in the open but also quite safely.
[00:55:26.332 --> 00:55:32.676]  I also want to mention we're going to do another live special broadcast tonight at 8 p.m.
[00:55:32.676 --> 00:55:35.277]  local Swiss time that is 1 p.m.
[00:55:35.277 --> 00:55:36.598]  Central Time in Texas.
[00:55:36.598 --> 00:55:43.162]  We're going to do another live special broadcast here on Saturday because we are just developing so many bombshell stories
[00:55:44.323 --> 00:55:51.508]  If you've been following Infowars.com coverage throughout the past week, you know we have had story after story.
[00:55:51.508 --> 00:55:58.132]  Rick Perry, Hillary Clinton, the agenda leaked by moles inside the Bilderberg meetings.
[00:55:58.132 --> 00:56:01.034]  That's just a few things I can remember off the top of my head.
[00:56:01.034 --> 00:56:04.116]  As we told you, we've been up all night developing our sources.
[00:56:05.237 --> 00:56:05.738]  We're good to go.
[00:56:24.737 --> 00:56:32.504]  Hopefully, Kurt Nemo and Steve Watson, who are doing the updating, while Paul Watson and myself are here in Switzerland.
[00:56:32.504 --> 00:56:36.227]  Hopefully, they can add that special broadcast to the website.
[00:56:36.227 --> 00:56:38.669]  We'll bring you more information as it develops.
[00:56:38.669 --> 00:56:41.772]  Just one more thing to mention before we end this broadcast.
[00:56:41.772 --> 00:56:49.298]  Alex Jones couldn't be here in Switzerland, although he really wanted to be, because he's in New York today giving a speech to the talker seminar.
[00:56:50.914 --> 00:57:05.702]  Which is itself a very bombshell development because the mainstream media has tried to ignore Alex Jones and yet at the same time they have seen his just absolutely meteoric rise gaining millions and millions of millions new listeners all the time.
[00:57:05.702 --> 00:57:07.783]  We've just got recent statistics
[00:57:09.262 --> 00:57:10.043]  Excuse me.
[00:57:10.043 --> 00:57:23.077]  We've just received recent statistics that only on the ShotKast streams alone on the internet, only one of several internet streams including Infowars.com, we're now getting 24 million viewers per month.
[00:57:23.077 --> 00:57:24.458]  Absolutely incredible.
[00:57:24.458 --> 00:57:31.486]  And so Alex is going to be talking about those kind of aspects, why he's able to grow so much as a member of the alternative media at the top.
[00:57:32.166 --> 00:57:32.586]  We're good to go.
[00:57:51.036 --> 00:57:51.477]  And why?
[00:57:51.477 --> 00:57:58.603]  They've given it a funny title at the talker's seminar, Guess Who's Coming to Keynote, because Alex is giving the keynote speech.
[00:57:58.603 --> 00:58:13.656]  That is actually a reference to a movie from the 60s called Guess Who's Coming to Dinner, a very controversial but also well-done movie with Sidney Poitier in the 60s, dealing with interracial couples and the shock of a parent at learning that their daughter's dating
[00:58:14.096 --> 00:58:15.157]  Yeah, I think so.
[00:58:37.529 --> 00:58:39.191]  We're good to go.
[00:58:59.191 --> 00:59:04.533]  2011, Bilderberg, here in Switzerland, and we will absolutely bring you more updates as they come in.
[00:59:04.533 --> 00:59:14.697]  We're going to be checking on numerous sources as we continue to break just bombshell information from inside the hotel and from here in the San Maritz community throughout the day.
[00:59:14.697 --> 00:59:21.700]  Please stay tuned at InfoWars.com and at JustinTV and as well on our Twitter account, RealAlexJones.
[00:59:22.460 --> 00:59:26.801]  We're going to end this special broadcast for now, but just another reminder, 1 p.m.
[00:59:26.801 --> 00:59:31.142]  Texas Central Time in the United States, and that is 8 p.m.
[00:59:31.142 --> 00:59:32.362]  in Swiss Time.
[00:59:32.362 --> 00:59:37.043]  We'll be doing another live special broadcast here on this Saturday, June 11th.
[00:59:37.043 --> 00:59:38.243]  For now, I'm signing off.
[00:59:38.243 --> 00:59:40.984]  This is Aaron Dykes, InfoWars.com.
[00:59:40.984 --> 00:59:46.025]  Please check the rebroadcast, share this information with your friends, ask them to look at it.
[00:59:46.025 --> 00:59:47.945]  If they don't know who the Bilderberg Group is yet,
[00:59:48.505 --> 00:59:48.966]  We're good to go.
[01:00:24.643 --> 01:00:25.344]  We're good.
[01:00:54.036 --> 01:01:00.879]  What if I say I'm not like the others?
[01:01:00.879 --> 01:01:13.125]  What if I say I'm not just another one of your planes?
