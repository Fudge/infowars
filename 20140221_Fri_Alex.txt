[00:00.000 --> 00:10.940]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well
[00:10.940 --> 00:18.480]  so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin
[00:18.480 --> 00:27.240]  Texas Alex Jones well it is Friday unbelievably again the 21st day of
[00:27.240 --> 00:34.480]  February 2014 and obviously there is always a ton of breaking news and
[00:34.480 --> 00:39.000]  information coming out we have Dr. Jerome Corsi joining us with breaking
[00:39.000 --> 00:43.720]  news from everything from Benghazi to what's happening with the economy we
[00:43.720 --> 00:49.420]  launched the new info wars website last night and it is got a lot of bugs in it
[00:49.420 --> 00:53.080]  obviously and we're gonna try to run it through the weekend and clean up the
[00:53.080 --> 00:56.920]  bugs and we're not able to we'll revert back to the old site next week for
[00:56.920 --> 01:01.040]  folks but if you like the old design prisonplanet.com is very similar to
[01:01.040 --> 01:04.960]  info wars it's a different color scheme so prisonplanet.com is there for
[01:04.960 --> 01:09.480]  folks that like the old format I mean overall I like the site it's more
[01:09.480 --> 01:14.440]  responsive and it'll work better on mobile devices once we've tweaked it but
[01:14.440 --> 01:18.040]  there are things that we just can't get fixed like a two-week old Larry Klayman
[01:18.040 --> 01:23.960]  YouTube interview that's in the featured video area on the right hand side of all
[01:23.960 --> 01:28.280]  the article pages you know there's there's there's stuff like that so so send
[01:28.280 --> 01:33.760]  your issues and your ideas because I pointed that out last night and it's
[01:33.760 --> 01:36.800]  still there we're just trying to figure out how to get that ghost out of the
[01:36.800 --> 01:43.280]  machine to show tips at info wars.com and like I said you know the article
[01:43.280 --> 01:46.400]  page looks better it's cleaner more modern we have an updated info wars
[01:46.400 --> 01:54.320]  design in eight years now some things like drudge again around since 95 96 the
[01:54.320 --> 01:59.360]  web is going to simpler and simpler and cleaner and cleaner so it's so old that
[01:59.360 --> 02:04.040]  it's now the cutting edge yet again and of course you could go with the design
[02:04.040 --> 02:08.480]  like that and we've looked at some other designs if this doesn't pan out right
[02:08.480 --> 02:12.520]  we've got some that are more like the London Guardian was before they changed
[02:12.520 --> 02:17.920]  it again a few months ago it's just it's the problem is taking your old website
[02:17.920 --> 02:25.560]  and then integrating it in with all of the new information because you've got a
[02:25.560 --> 02:30.200]  website around since you know 96 like our website and then all those articles
[02:30.200 --> 02:34.200]  all that information you've got to integrate that in with a new design it
[02:34.200 --> 02:38.080]  is it is a kettle of fish and we have hired a couple different companies and
[02:38.080 --> 02:41.600]  then they've done a great job and then we're just here trying to integrate it
[02:41.600 --> 02:47.320]  in on our end so we'll be talking about some of that but the new info wars is
[02:47.320 --> 02:53.760]  up today you can check that out and see it for yourself and you'll see tweaks
[02:53.760 --> 02:57.960]  and changes happening to it throughout the day but it's but it's meant to have
[02:57.960 --> 03:02.520]  you know a more responsive field and work better on mobiles even though right
[03:02.520 --> 03:07.000]  now it's working on mobiles but but probably not the way it should because
[03:07.000 --> 03:11.080]  it blocks out a lot of the info in fact we're going to be converting the mobile
[03:11.080 --> 03:15.040]  thing just for now to a static look where it's the full website and then you
[03:15.040 --> 03:18.320]  just kind of go around and look at what you want to like the old info wars
[03:18.320 --> 03:23.960]  that's an idea we can make the mobile the old info wars that sounds complete
[03:23.960 --> 03:28.760]  or or we can upload two versions every day to where you could have either version
[03:28.760 --> 03:32.240]  of what you want this is the type of stuff you know that we deal with but
[03:32.240 --> 03:39.000]  bottom line it's about this radio show what pulls the entire train the news the

[08:43.360 --> 08:49.720]  accelerating and Dr. Jerome Corsi is going to be joining us today and the
[08:49.720 --> 08:56.560]  third hour to break that down in the meantime ladies and gentlemen it is

[09:05.660 --> 09:09.960]  sit here in Chronicle what the globalists are up to and how humanity is
[09:09.960 --> 09:14.680]  beginning to wake up to them now an example of humanity waking up is the
[09:14.680 --> 09:21.520]  fact that last week and then earlier this week we ran articles on info wars
[09:21.520 --> 09:30.880]  calm and prison planet calm dealing with the fact that Obama we also covered
[09:30.880 --> 09:35.640]  this last year is planning on putting monitors for quote bias and attract
[09:35.640 --> 09:42.760]  how you news gather in quote all newsrooms a unprecedented FCC power
[09:42.760 --> 09:47.680]  grab because the FCC is only over broadcast and what's over the broadcast
[09:47.680 --> 09:51.720]  not the content and it's really is unprecedented
[09:51.720 --> 09:56.320]  tyranny well when drugs report calm and others began to carry it earlier in
[09:56.320 --> 10:02.000]  the week it is now spilled out into the mainstream media today and yesterday and
[10:02.000 --> 10:07.520]  there is now a national debate happening if you go up to prison planet calm or
[10:07.520 --> 10:11.640]  info wars calm and you can see one of the beta tests one of the new looks for
[10:11.640 --> 10:17.120]  info wars we're looking at doesn't mean it's final but we're we're tweaking it
[10:17.120 --> 10:21.880]  but there's the new info wars look for now get give us your feedback on it folks
[10:21.880 --> 10:27.240]  in the comment pages show tips at info wars calm you will see the article
[10:27.240 --> 10:36.560]  judge Napolitano government monitoring newsrooms radical new era of tyranny
[10:36.560 --> 10:41.840]  judge Andrew Napolitano warns the Obama administration plan to have FCC bureaucrats
[10:41.840 --> 10:46.800]  monitor newsroom represents a radical new era of tyranny and would squash
[10:46.800 --> 10:52.120]  freedom of the press yes it is a radical new era of tyranny instead Cruz has said
[10:52.120 --> 10:57.600]  Obama is frightening and dangerous as I've said he is trying to become a
[10:57.600 --> 11:02.960]  dictator 2.0 for the bureaucracy in the special interest set the precedent that
[11:02.960 --> 11:08.120]  a president can do whatever he wants this is his real issue and people say oh
[11:08.120 --> 11:12.840]  don't be so radical when you're faced with radical government when you're
[11:12.840 --> 11:19.000]  faced with radical extremist behavior that's what it is and so many times in
[11:19.000 --> 11:24.320]  history I know I beat this dead horse so many times in history over and over
[11:24.320 --> 11:30.360]  again people are faced with a linen a Stalin a Hitler a Mao a Napoleon a
[11:30.360 --> 11:36.120]  Pol Pot a Fidel Castro and they just don't want to admit that oh they're
[11:36.120 --> 11:41.640]  having tyranny in their time they don't want to admit that and so they basically
[11:41.640 --> 11:48.240]  fall to it because all this couldn't be happening to me Rick Linklater the
[11:48.240 --> 11:54.000]  director good friend of mine like 15 years ago when I first met him in my
[11:54.000 --> 11:56.520]  first meeting with him he was a listener my radio show and he wanted to meet me
[11:56.520 --> 12:00.120]  so went down to his studios and I went there's like an hour and a half meeting
[12:00.120 --> 12:03.720]  with him in his office it was almost like being a psychologist office or
[12:03.720 --> 12:07.120]  something and he was just intensely talking to me and he said you know the
[12:07.120 --> 12:11.160]  problem is people expect the dictator to show up like Hitler in a funny little
[12:11.160 --> 12:15.480]  suit and a funny little mustache each generation doesn't recognize how the
[12:15.480 --> 12:20.840]  tyranny shows up in their time and and and of course that was that simple for
[12:20.840 --> 12:24.320]  me to know today but it was fundamental then I was like oh I guess I guess you're
[12:24.320 --> 12:27.800]  right he was explaining to me why people didn't understand it and he was saying
[12:27.800 --> 12:33.040]  you have to connect what happened in the past visually and and audibly and
[12:33.040 --> 12:37.840]  semantically to what's happening now as he goes I know you're a smart guy and
[12:37.840 --> 12:48.800]  meanwhile and you're young and I was like 25 years old then 40 now but now
[12:48.800 --> 12:52.520]  here we are all these years later and it's just all out in the open in our
[12:52.520 --> 12:59.400]  face but this is a big deal what we see unfolding on every front and we've got
[12:59.400 --> 13:04.840]  to respond to it properly if we don't run around and get upset about it no one
[13:04.840 --> 13:08.840]  else around us will think there's a problem and I'm not saying put on an
[13:08.840 --> 13:15.520]  act I don't get up here and yell and scream on air as an act but sometimes I
[13:15.520 --> 13:19.800]  dress up like Cobra commander or the Joker to do a skit and then that's an
[13:19.800 --> 13:27.360]  act but it's what I believe I'm using satire to illustrate something I believe
[13:27.360 --> 13:31.640]  in my heart to try to wake people up you see what I'm saying but organically the
[13:31.640 --> 13:37.440]  reason I've been somewhat successful wildly successful on many fronts
[13:37.440 --> 13:42.840]  waking people up in fact if you talk to most new libertarians or people that are
[13:42.840 --> 13:45.600]  aware of the new world order now anywhere in the world they'll say Alex Jones
[13:45.600 --> 13:50.560]  Alex Jones nine times out of ten Alex Jones got me to think first and it's
[13:50.560 --> 13:54.120]  not because I'm that eloquent or I'm that good of a guy but I did it an
[13:54.120 --> 14:01.080]  organic primitive level get upset have high energy and yell and scream and
[14:01.080 --> 14:05.080]  and hyperventilate and beat the table because I'm desperate and I'm frustrated
[14:05.080 --> 14:13.680]  and that's what will get your fellow man moving I mean if you go to Hollywood
[14:13.680 --> 14:17.120]  renditions of things like 300 that has a lot of fiction in it but a lot of
[14:17.120 --> 14:22.400]  historical truth in it as well you've got a rousing speech there about we've
[14:22.400 --> 14:27.320]  got to be ready to die for our republic and have the glory of being real men
[14:27.320 --> 14:33.080]  here today are you with me or the William Wallace speech that really happened
[14:33.080 --> 14:37.560]  about many years from now lying in our beds what would you give just once just
[14:37.560 --> 14:42.640]  once to come back here and tell our enemies you can take our lives but
[14:42.640 --> 14:51.000]  you'll never take our freedom that's what it's all about they tell you don't
[14:51.000 --> 14:55.480]  have energy in politics don't get upset don't have strong rhetoric just go along
[14:55.480 --> 14:58.920]  to get along that's how you get ahead in life that is not how you get ahead in
[14:58.920 --> 15:02.880]  life you may get ahead in life in a corporation or a marriage or a business
[15:02.880 --> 15:07.000]  or at the golf club being nice and congenial and that is how you should act
[15:07.000 --> 15:11.200]  in nice company but you do not do that with a predatory global corporate
[15:11.200 --> 15:15.360]  takeover coming in and taking over if you sit there and just mince words with
[15:15.360 --> 15:19.400]  it we're going to lose if you get aggressive get out of your comfort zone
[15:19.400 --> 15:27.400]  get angry take action tell it like it is people will hear what you say and they
[15:27.400 --> 15:34.440]  will wake up when what happens when a crow up in a tree while the other crows
[15:34.440 --> 15:37.680]  are down foraging on the ground they'll leave a watchman up in the top of the
[15:37.680 --> 15:41.560]  tree crows are one of the smartest birds out there in major studies all black
[15:41.560 --> 15:48.320]  birds are in that family of the the ravens the crows you name it there's
[15:48.320 --> 15:52.800]  about the smartest birds there are they can count you name it you get a gaggle
[15:52.800 --> 15:56.280]  of crows even bigger group I guess is a murder that's what they call them and
[15:56.280 --> 16:00.680]  you'll get them up there watching and they'll flap around and if they
[16:00.680 --> 16:05.200]  see something like a human or something else that could be dangerous to the
[16:05.200 --> 16:09.720]  crows that are on the ground and that's all I'm doing is hopping around up in
[16:09.720 --> 16:17.000]  the top of the tree going and and and and the young Turks will probably play
[16:17.000 --> 16:20.360]  that clip and say oh look at what a cookie is he makes you know he makes
[16:20.360 --> 16:26.440]  bird noises out of context I'm trying to illustrate what I do at a primitive
[16:26.440 --> 16:30.360]  level it's not that special it's just that we've been taught not to run around
[16:30.360 --> 16:33.920]  like chickens with their heads cut off I mean Paul Revere wrote around on a big
[16:33.920 --> 16:39.920]  black horse saying get your guns and get ready to kill people to arms to arms the
[16:39.920 --> 16:44.480]  Redcoats are coming the British are coming one of my land two of my sea to
[16:44.480 --> 16:48.760]  arms to arms with other people riding out I just go to Pierce Morgan and say

[18:40.360 --> 18:44.000]  just ran at the president praising the First Amendment right we're accurate and
[18:44.000 --> 18:48.760]  true what he forgot to say however is that this freedom is not just necessary
[18:48.760 --> 18:53.800]  and vital it's absolutely guaranteed in the First Amendment beyond dispute
[18:53.800 --> 18:58.080]  there is no case that stands for the contrary of that proposition to survive
[18:58.080 --> 19:01.160]  based on the pressure that it's going to receive I don't think so that's a great
[19:01.160 --> 19:06.400]  question this this is a radical new era of tyranny for the White House I can't
[19:06.400 --> 19:10.600]  imagine it getting to first base right now what do you recommend Roger Ailes
[19:10.600 --> 19:16.160]  do if the FCC shows up here Mr. Ailes throw them out unless they have a
[19:16.160 --> 19:19.360]  search warrant from a judge which they'll never get that's right but they
[19:19.360 --> 19:21.840]  don't care they'll show up everybody'll kiss their butt or they'll tie it to

[24:32.160 --> 24:36.800]  York City but that's the CNS news.com headline more black babies killed by
[24:36.800 --> 24:44.400]  abortion than born that's right ladies and gentlemen simply amazing more
[24:44.400 --> 24:52.000]  killed by abortion than born and that is part of the national average as well
[24:52.000 --> 24:56.680]  but don't hold your breath to hear the NAACP talk about that ladies and
[24:56.680 --> 25:04.000]  gentlemen don't ever hold your breath to discuss anything like that by the way
[25:04.000 --> 25:10.440]  pretty amazing from the FBI well first off the the the FCC commissioner came
[25:10.440 --> 25:14.600]  out and criticized Obama's plan and holders plan because that's who's
[25:14.600 --> 25:23.240]  driving it they run everything to come in and come into every newsroom and
[25:23.240 --> 25:29.360]  quote make sure you're covering news that helps women and minorities that's
[25:29.360 --> 25:32.200]  just a way to get into the newsroom and then start claiming everything's racist
[25:32.200 --> 25:37.000]  or whatever it's a First Amendment you have no right period to be involved no
[25:37.000 --> 25:40.840]  matter what the news is I can put whatever quote slant on and I want my
[25:40.840 --> 25:46.080]  slant is freedom my bias is liberty I'm gonna engage in a serious agenda of
[25:46.080 --> 25:52.120]  truth and the Constitution from a libertarian perspective I wear it on my
[25:52.120 --> 25:56.320]  sleeve they're like who we're gonna find if there's bias bias the attorney
[25:56.320 --> 26:00.320]  general runs around saying brainwash people against guns so on the heels of
[26:00.320 --> 26:04.320]  that and our reporter David Knight's been calling the FCC the last few days
[26:04.320 --> 26:08.160]  about this he's tried to get comments from them they've been stonewalling and
[26:08.160 --> 26:12.240]  then now they've been flip-flopping so this is gonna be some breaking news from
[26:12.240 --> 26:16.440]  the FCC that you're about to hear and maybe one of our writers wants to pick
[26:16.440 --> 26:21.160]  up on this and put it out because it's it's a definitely national news what
[26:21.160 --> 26:26.840]  they're up to but shifting gears into another First Amendment chilling
[26:26.840 --> 26:33.520]  effect weekly standard reports senators demand FBI head answer questions about
[26:33.520 --> 26:38.960]  indictment of Dinesh DeSousa so that's good the issue that he's clearly being
[26:38.960 --> 26:42.280]  politically persecuted even if you don't believe that when the evidence is
[26:42.280 --> 26:47.360]  overwhelming that he is imagine if Michael Moore two years after he put out
[26:47.360 --> 26:52.200]  Fahrenheit 9-11 had been indicted by the Bush White House Justice Department I
[26:52.200 --> 26:58.560]  mean people would be freaking out I would be freaking out over some campaign
[26:58.560 --> 27:03.960]  donations of a few thousand dollars that bundling is completely done across the
[27:03.960 --> 27:07.560]  board by Democrats Republicans it's the same stuff they indicted Ken Lay and
[27:07.560 --> 27:12.880]  spent six years trying to put him in jail for so here it is senators demand
[27:12.880 --> 27:17.920]  FBI head answer questions about indictment of Dinesh DeSousa for United
[27:17.920 --> 27:22.040]  States senators have written a letter to FBI Director James Comey about the
[27:22.040 --> 27:26.480]  indictment of author and filmmaker Dinesh DeSousa Senator Charles Grassley
[27:26.480 --> 27:30.000]  ranking member of the judiciary committee to his bipartisan you notice
[27:30.000 --> 27:35.280]  Jeff Sessions Ted Cruz Mike Lee and force and our four senators all
[27:35.280 --> 27:39.320]  Republicans but also some Democrats who have signed the letter the letter quotes
[27:39.320 --> 27:43.000]  Harvard law school professor Alan Dershowitz is saying I can't help but
[27:43.000 --> 27:47.480]  think DeSousa's politics have something to do with it it smacks of selective
[27:47.480 --> 27:52.680]  prosecution and of course you know he's a big Democrat and the senators right to
[27:52.680 --> 27:56.000]  dispel the sort of public perception that Mr. DeSousa may have been targeted
[27:56.000 --> 27:59.840]  because of his outspoken criticisms the president's important for the FBI to be
[27:59.840 --> 28:07.040]  transparent regarding the precise origin of the investigation well folks here's
[28:07.040 --> 28:13.880]  the issue Obama got about a third you look this up of his donations last go
[28:13.880 --> 28:19.520]  around and before that as well from offshore IP addresses and public
[28:19.520 --> 28:24.520]  offshore he would go to offshore foreign fundraisers quote were Americans
[28:24.520 --> 28:27.720]  would be meeting him but he would get all sorts of money and then you've got
[28:27.720 --> 28:33.040]  salindra and fast and furious and all the bid-rigging and all the corruption
[28:33.040 --> 28:38.960]  and the takeover of General Motors and taking the franchises away from people
[28:38.960 --> 28:47.800]  that weren't Democrats I mean just really mafia government type stuff and when
[28:47.800 --> 28:52.080]  they go after Republican governors for crooked toenails when they go after
[28:52.080 --> 28:59.040]  filmmakers everybody is in deep trouble obviously and that's coming out the
[28:59.040 --> 29:02.640]  other's a headline right there Obama's offshore team some of the president's
[29:02.640 --> 29:09.440]  top donors are foreign tax havens yep just look it up it appears from US
[29:09.440 --> 29:12.960]  attorney's office comment this is senators that the FBI conducts regular
[29:12.960 --> 29:16.760]  perhaps random reviews of campaign filings this is correct or so what
[29:16.760 --> 29:20.120]  methodologies the FBI uses conduct these reviews well let me tell you they admit
[29:20.120 --> 29:26.360]  with the IRS they didn't audit one 501c3 progressive or democratic or
[29:26.360 --> 29:29.880]  communist organization that came out in the news last year that pull that up
[29:29.880 --> 29:38.360]  guys they did not at one or hold up one of their charity authorizations to get
[29:38.360 --> 29:43.200]  the 501c3 and they basically audited every tea party organization harassed
[29:43.200 --> 29:47.040]  them shut them down and wouldn't give them the designations I mean there it is
[29:47.040 --> 29:52.320]  right there okay a rain of terror we're on the March the Empire's on the run

[34:00.280 --> 34:09.560]  Alex Jones how they fight for the right yeah but who's to say you understand
[34:09.560 --> 34:15.880]  folks all of our ancestors no matter where you've come from have absolutely
[34:15.880 --> 34:20.240]  had to go through hell and back so that we would have any basic liberty any
[34:20.240 --> 34:26.040]  basic dignity from all the corrupt kings and regimes and oppressors that have
[34:26.040 --> 34:30.800]  come and gone and Magna Carta and the Bill of Rights and the Constitution and
[34:30.800 --> 34:35.800]  everything that has been Western jurisprudence has been an absolute God's
[34:35.800 --> 34:41.280]  sin to humanity and it is now being destroyed by the globalist it is now
[34:41.280 --> 34:49.920]  being removed decimated brought low and I am here to try to bring it back now
[34:49.920 --> 34:57.040]  continuing here with some of the news that is coming up today obviously that
[34:57.040 --> 35:04.040]  is up on info wars calm and prison planet calm there is just a ton of it
[35:04.040 --> 35:11.040]  that we are going to be breaking down today China is starting to make a power
[35:11.040 --> 35:16.760]  move against the US dollar more on Obama administration embedding government
[35:16.760 --> 35:21.040]  researchers to monitor media organizations that's called spies government
[35:21.040 --> 35:25.480]  spies openly coming into your organization to dig up things to try to
[35:25.480 --> 35:30.360]  throw at you we're going to get into Polish minister if opposition does not
[35:30.360 --> 35:36.920]  accept deal in Ukraine martial law will be declared and you'll all be dead
[35:36.920 --> 35:41.280]  there's been a chord signed in Ukraine but doubts are strong the New York Times
[35:41.280 --> 35:45.840]  reports in battle president of Ukraine and leaders of the opposition signed a
[35:45.840 --> 35:50.640]  political deal today aimed at ending a spiral of lethal violence with early
[35:50.640 --> 35:56.080]  elections and a reduction in presidential powers but Russia declined
[35:56.080 --> 35:59.040]  to endorse the accord and many protesters said nothing short of
[35:59.040 --> 36:06.280]  president's resignation would get them off the street so that is what is coming
[36:06.280 --> 36:15.040]  up on that front we will continue to watch what is going on on that
[36:15.040 --> 36:19.400]  situation because it affects basically everything here's an article out of the
[36:19.400 --> 36:25.720]  weekly standard Michelle Obama young people are knuckleheads that's a quote
[36:25.720 --> 36:29.960]  which is why they need Obamacare so they're I've seen the Obamacare ads we
[36:29.960 --> 36:33.280]  played them here where the good liberal parents know best and they get their
[36:33.280 --> 36:37.480]  their college student to do it but the college student is so trendy they've
[36:37.480 --> 36:42.520]  already done it and explain that to mom and dad and the sales job is young
[36:42.520 --> 36:48.760]  people got to sign up and be screwed by this or no one else is gonna be able to
[36:48.760 --> 36:53.160]  have the program continue forward sit that on television last night so we're
[36:53.160 --> 36:58.600]  gonna be we're gonna be going over all of that report coming up as well today
[36:58.600 --> 37:04.320]  again if you look at info wars.com it's a new design and we've had some bugs in
[37:04.320 --> 37:08.440]  launching it let us know what you think of it I think it's a nice clean design
[37:08.440 --> 37:15.720]  the article pages look nice there's stuff like the featured top news stuff
[37:15.720 --> 37:20.600]  that I wanted to simply get moved from the top to the middle has been removed
[37:20.600 --> 37:25.160]  so we'll be putting that back and there's a lot of programming going on a lot of
[37:25.160 --> 37:30.160]  shifting a lot of testing on the fly this weekend with the site and I'll make
[37:30.160 --> 37:33.440]  the determination whether I want to go with this design or not by Monday and
[37:33.440 --> 37:37.240]  go back with the old design until we come out with something else a month down
[37:37.240 --> 37:40.640]  the road and I'm just gonna keep going back to the drawing board until I like
[37:40.640 --> 37:46.520]  it and until you like it this one's the closest yet to something that I would
[37:46.520 --> 37:53.400]  go with but again it's a train wreck when it comes to trying to get all the old
[37:53.400 --> 37:57.440]  data that's on there and then integrate it in with all the new data but we're
[37:57.440 --> 38:00.840]  trying as best we can so thank you for bearing with us if you liked the old
[38:00.840 --> 38:05.160]  look of info wars calm prison planet calm is basically that and it will
[38:05.160 --> 38:10.920]  continue on for the foreseeable future if you like that look prison planet calm
[38:10.920 --> 38:16.120]  but we are truly trying to you know innovate the sites and update them here
[38:16.120 --> 38:19.800]  and doing the best we can so thank you all for your support in the crew it's
[38:19.800 --> 38:24.080]  up to late last night and this morning still working on that but it's like
[38:24.080 --> 38:27.680]  funny we fixed one thing and then it breaks another it's like move this up
[38:27.680 --> 38:33.720]  here and this down here so then this down here just disappears and it's like
[38:33.720 --> 38:40.480]  okay well so so it's almost one of just not do the radio show right now and go
[38:40.480 --> 38:44.240]  off air because that's my problem is I got all those other decisions to make
[38:44.240 --> 38:51.680]  and and then and then go in there and then just say you know see if we if we we
[38:51.680 --> 38:57.080]  move that the breaking news from the top and put the radio stuff on top then it
[38:57.080 --> 39:01.400]  just goes under it it doesn't like go to the Phantom Zone of course that's the
[39:01.400 --> 39:08.680]  programming though is dealing with that type of stuff so I think we have like a
[39:08.680 --> 39:14.680]  actual reservoir back there of kind of like the minions from speckled man I
[39:14.680 --> 39:18.200]  actually think that's what's going on and then I'm kind of like the mad
[39:18.200 --> 39:21.000]  scientist with the gray hair out on the sides it doesn't know what I'm doing
[39:21.000 --> 39:26.240]  either so we will we will continue to have continue to have fun with the
[39:26.240 --> 39:31.520]  entire thing speaking of funding our laboratory ladies and gentlemen of true
[39:31.520 --> 39:36.400]  independent media that has an open pro-liberty bias to the truth which I
[39:36.400 --> 39:41.640]  will not apologize for extremism and defense of liberty is no vice to quote
[39:41.640 --> 39:50.040]  the Great Berry Goldwater and sometimes silence isn't golden it's yellow but we
[39:50.040 --> 39:52.920]  do need your financial support as well we try to say the best stuff there is out
[39:52.920 --> 39:56.800]  there the best supplements the best proprietary double-strength half the

[40:20.920 --> 40:24.640]  you to know it's an old shows design that our graphics people put together with

[40:31.320 --> 40:36.160]  wreath around it and then it says 1776 and Roman numerals under it moulin
[40:36.160 --> 40:40.240]  lobby come and take it and there's also another info wars variant that has

[40:48.640 --> 40:52.200]  wars in the back and fours in the front moulin lobby on the back that t-shirt
[40:52.200 --> 40:58.960]  did sell out but more arrived today so if you want them get them info or store
[40:58.960 --> 41:03.280]  dot com and then wear it out there people say what is that those Spartan
[41:03.280 --> 41:07.560]  things been really popular since 300 the new 300s coming out and it is a pro
[41:07.560 --> 41:11.520]  citizens being armed message it's a true story like the Alamo turn your guns
[41:11.520 --> 41:15.520]  in no come and take it the Spartans said thousands years ago and they were
[41:15.520 --> 41:20.120]  quoting them at the Alamo just in 1836 and we're quoting them now I mean we're
[41:20.120 --> 41:24.400]  just like the people the Alamo just like the people in Greece same people
[41:24.400 --> 41:29.560]  folks we're just humans you think about that being a long time ago your you had
[41:29.560 --> 41:33.840]  a mother and a father they had a mother and father and the connection of them
[41:33.840 --> 41:37.960]  changing our diapers feeding us raising us it just goes right back to
[41:37.960 --> 41:42.400]  antiquity we're just like those people were though our DNA is more broken and
[41:42.400 --> 41:46.000]  poison from all the chemicals and things they've got a lot of statistics and
[41:46.000 --> 41:50.840]  numbers they've looked at the DNA I think the average Spartan had an IQ over 20
[41:50.840 --> 41:54.280]  points higher than us and if they were around today with all this food and
[41:54.280 --> 41:59.240]  medicine would have to be at 120 but so I guess we're not what we used to be but
[41:59.240 --> 42:03.560]  the point is is that in many respects we are getting worse because of the
[42:03.560 --> 42:07.480]  industrialized society that which does not kill us only makes us stronger
[42:07.480 --> 42:12.200]  unless it's total decadence and then what did Victor Hugo the great French
[42:12.200 --> 42:18.120]  statesman and philosopher say he said that prosperity well first he said
[42:18.120 --> 42:22.840]  adversity makes men prosperity makes monsters and that really is true but
[42:22.840 --> 42:27.840]  info or store.com made in 1776.com will take you right to the subpage that has
[42:27.840 --> 42:33.920]  all the made in America apparel and belt buckles and other festoonery so you can

[42:55.880 --> 43:00.600]  not politically correct I really want to apologize to everybody made in 1776.com
[43:00.600 --> 43:05.800]  or info or store.com is the master page or info or life.com takes you right to
[43:05.800 --> 43:09.840]  our proprietary three supplements we've rolled out and of course the best
[43:09.840 --> 43:15.200]  organic coffee out there in my opinion at the lowest price info or store.com or
[43:15.200 --> 43:22.760]  888-253-3139 or now I mentioned this earlier so I'll just bring it up now
[43:22.760 --> 43:28.720]  yeah here it is IRS approved liberal groups well tea party in limbo and it
[43:28.720 --> 43:32.760]  was supported by USA Today that they did not unapproved or or go after one
[43:32.760 --> 43:39.480]  liberal anti-freedom fascist scumbag group but any group that believes in men
[43:39.480 --> 43:42.680]  and women being able to have children and own property and not be slaves they
[43:42.680 --> 43:46.680]  were all shut down audited or harassed into oblivion and that's USA Today just
[43:46.680 --> 43:50.280]  I just mentioned that earlier but I didn't just want to just mention it not
[43:50.280 --> 43:54.000]  not show you just one example of it so the guys printed that off because that's
[43:54.000 --> 43:57.680]  what they do we got two guys that's sitting there they rotate through running
[43:57.680 --> 44:00.680]  the board and the cameras and they just take whatever I say and they put in a
[44:00.680 --> 44:04.160]  search engine and then and then they just throw it on screen of your TV viewer
[44:04.160 --> 44:08.680]  so you understand I'm not making this stuff up I'm not making this stuff up
[44:08.680 --> 44:14.400]  believe me I wish every day I was making this stuff up I wish every day this this
[44:14.400 --> 44:20.160]  was an act it's not an act it's a hundred percent real and I believe
[44:20.160 --> 44:28.920]  everything I'm saying but I do let myself get mad I do get upset to try to
[44:28.920 --> 44:33.440]  upset other people so it is an act and that's how the real world works it's a
[44:33.440 --> 44:40.040]  paradox now when I was 22 years old or 25 none of it was an act like I was
[44:40.040 --> 44:43.960]  totally out of control and I'm still out of control I mean what do you I mean is
[44:43.960 --> 44:48.080]  it an act when you drive your car down the road and control it or are you just
[44:48.080 --> 44:51.240]  supposed to just wildly start turning the wheel everywhere and put the
[44:51.240 --> 44:59.880]  accelerator on when I was on the BBC last year covering Bilderberg on their
[44:59.880 --> 45:05.040]  big morning show and when we went off air I stopped yelling at him and I got
[45:05.040 --> 45:08.080]  up and said okay thank you and shook the guy's hand he goes that's all an act I
[45:08.080 --> 45:11.120]  went no it's not an act we're not on air you were talking over me I talked over
[45:11.120 --> 45:15.120]  you I want to make a big scene here showing that it's not business as
[45:15.120 --> 45:19.160]  usual that's not an act so he tweeted out that I admitted it was all an act and
[45:19.160 --> 45:22.120]  the reason I raised that act point is I could ask that question more than
[45:22.120 --> 45:26.360]  anything more than why aren't you dead I get asked is it an act I don't know is
[45:26.360 --> 45:28.920]  it an act I told you the NSA was spying on everything and how they were doing it
[45:28.920 --> 45:31.720]  and it's all come out wasn't an act to pose the military train to take your
[45:31.720 --> 45:35.200]  guns and now it's admitted wasn't an act I told you the FCC was gonna put
[45:35.200 --> 45:39.640]  monitors and all the businesses all the media organizations and all the stuff
[45:39.640 --> 45:46.680]  look I'm just covering what's going on is it an act when I put white makeup on
[45:46.680 --> 45:50.760]  because the Joker was coming out four years ago and tried to hijack that for
[45:50.760 --> 45:55.360]  some liberty issues yeah it was an act I don't really laugh and scream and throw
[45:55.360 --> 45:59.880]  papers around and talk about how much I love evil it's called satire very
[45:59.880 --> 46:03.320]  frustrating now I wanted to bring David Knight in here he's got the documents we
[46:03.320 --> 46:08.400]  can document cam that in a moment this is some breaking FCC news judge
[46:08.400 --> 46:12.840]  Napolitano it's up on info wars calm called government monitoring newsrooms
[46:12.840 --> 46:18.240]  radical new era of tyranny and and that's not a sensational headline that's
[46:18.240 --> 46:23.080]  what it is if you catch Jeffrey Dahmer with ten guys in chemical tubs in
[46:23.080 --> 46:30.720]  barrels this is a radical form of evil in a macabre nightmare laboratory of
[46:30.720 --> 46:33.760]  torture we've discovered if I was a prosecutor that's how to describe it
[46:33.760 --> 46:37.640]  well what's Obama doing well a radical new era of tyranny as Ted Cruz said
[46:37.640 --> 46:42.160]  frightening and dangerous how would you describe Obama you called the FCC you
[46:42.160 --> 46:45.720]  got letters from him you got a response from him I want you to run with the guys
[46:45.720 --> 46:48.560]  around an article after this because this is breaking news David you're doing
[46:48.560 --> 46:53.560]  real journalism here God bless you just you churn out so much real research what
[46:53.560 --> 46:57.400]  would you call Obama first what would you describe this transformation well
[46:57.400 --> 47:02.400]  it's definitely authoritarian what we're seeing here is an open in your face kind
[47:02.400 --> 47:06.920]  of criminal corruption so it's a naked mobsterism absolutely they brought it
[47:06.920 --> 47:10.920]  up to a new level as people pointed out with the IRS Nixon did this a long time
[47:10.920 --> 47:14.400]  ago but he was impeached was a hundred names and a safe though exactly not
[47:14.400 --> 47:18.600]  millions they the IRS didn't actually execute it and the IRS didn't actually
[47:18.600 --> 47:23.000]  defend it and cover it up now they do it openly and they continue to do it even
[47:23.000 --> 47:26.880]  after they're exposed so they clearly don't care about that we knew we weren't
[47:26.880 --> 47:30.960]  going to get any answers from the FCC so what we did was we videotaped the whole
[47:30.960 --> 47:35.160]  process of running around getting answering machines the guide sends us
[47:35.160 --> 47:38.240]  over to their media release that on the news tonight it was on the news last I
[47:38.240 --> 47:41.040]  didn't even know that yeah well take your thing get it let's get it up on the
[47:41.040 --> 47:44.320]  site good lord so finally we call him back and say hey nobody's answering
[47:44.320 --> 47:47.840]  that number he's put himself on answering machine now so the guys we watch
[47:47.840 --> 47:50.800]  the news I miss the last night I apologize the guy they had as a contact
[47:50.800 --> 47:54.280]  person basically didn't want to be the contact person and we had a difficult
[47:54.280 --> 47:57.560]  time getting somebody from media relations to talk to us finally they sent
[47:57.560 --> 48:04.320]  us a modified definition of the study as well as a response to a congressman who's
[48:04.320 --> 48:07.640]  complaining about this now this really started to pick up steam we reported on
[48:07.640 --> 48:11.440]  this quite some time back but it started picking up steam about February the 10th
[48:11.440 --> 48:16.240]  I believe yeah that's when it was we had one of the FCC commissioners write
[48:16.240 --> 48:21.360]  a scathing op-ed piece attacking this whole study and in response to that
[48:21.360 --> 48:24.720]  congressional committee started so they they sent out that by the way this is
[48:24.720 --> 48:29.680]  fairness doctrine by uber stealth yes yes it's fairness doctrine but you can
[48:29.680 --> 48:32.880]  also see when you look at the report you can see how they stonewall us why they
[48:32.880 --> 48:36.320]  accuse us of ambush journalism when we're trying to finally get transparency
[48:36.320 --> 48:39.560]  from them every time we try to talk to the government it's the same story
[48:39.560 --> 48:42.920]  nobody will talk to you nobody will grant you an interview so finally when
[48:42.920 --> 48:46.040]  you go there and show up and start to talk to somebody oh this is ambush
[48:46.040 --> 48:49.120]  drill you guys are evil you know because you're coming here to talk to me they
[48:49.120 --> 48:52.240]  want to cover up everything they all think that they're the CIA everything is
[48:52.240 --> 48:55.520]  classified nobody wants to talk about anything of course there's also the
[48:55.520 --> 48:59.320]  aspect that they're in a bureaucracy they don't have the courage to say
[48:59.320 --> 49:02.400]  something because they're afraid they might say something that hasn't been
[49:02.400 --> 49:05.960]  vetted and cleared by their masters so all they will do is send out press
[49:05.960 --> 49:10.360]  releases about this but listen to the way they change the study over time when
[49:10.360 --> 49:12.720]  they first put it out they said in order to assess whether the government
[49:12.720 --> 49:16.280]  action is needed to ensure that the information needs of all Americans are
[49:16.280 --> 49:20.840]  being met including women and minorities that was the original purpose of it now
[49:20.840 --> 49:24.520]  that they're getting criticism what they're saying is that it's about the
[49:24.520 --> 49:27.800]  it's a study of the ability of entrepreneurs and small business to
[49:27.800 --> 49:32.440]  compete in the media marketplace so it went from looking at the information
[49:32.440 --> 49:36.880]  needs of women and minorities to seeing how we can help small businesses see
[49:36.880 --> 49:40.720]  they're from the government they're here to help oh I mean you're not racist are
[49:40.720 --> 49:43.640]  you you're not against women and minorities that are really the super
[49:43.640 --> 49:48.680]  majority women are 51% of the population in mammals and here they are 52% for a
[49:48.680 --> 49:51.880]  strange reason and then you've got the quote minorities that are the majority
[49:51.880 --> 49:58.760]  so we're talking 77% of people oh you're against the 77% well the whole thing
[49:58.760 --> 50:02.440]  hey turn your guns in or you're against women yeah the whole thing is very
[50:02.440 --> 50:06.800]  phony one of the thing one of the quotes from this op-ed piece by the FCC
[50:06.800 --> 50:10.360]  commissioner his name is Ajit Pai I don't know if I'm pronouncing that
[50:10.360 --> 50:14.280]  correctly it's AJIT but he said how can they want to go in and look at the news
[50:14.280 --> 50:18.600]  judgments of editors he says how can the news judgments made by editors and
[50:18.600 --> 50:23.040]  station managers impede small business from entering the broadcast industry it
[50:23.040 --> 50:26.400]  has nothing to do well what does some bureaucrat know about news editors and
[50:26.400 --> 50:28.880]  people that have worked their whole lives in this that's right it's all about
[50:28.880 --> 50:32.680]  government being my god and these are political commas are so I want to come
[50:32.680 --> 50:36.680]  back and talk more about this here's your report that's what I don't like about
[50:36.680 --> 50:41.240]  the new info wars design I wanted that same links at the top of every page to

[54:13.480 --> 54:20.000]  by the way Ted Nugent called Obama a subhuman mongrel which I don't think is
[54:20.000 --> 54:25.720]  an accurate characterization and got criticized by people like Rand Paul and
[54:25.720 --> 54:33.680]  Ted Cruz and so he apologized and I guess the implication is oh you know he's
[54:33.680 --> 54:40.960]  being racist or something that's just a way to insult somebody Obama is a peacock
[54:40.960 --> 54:48.200]  of evil in a fancy suit trained to lie and deceive people with a super high IQ
[54:48.200 --> 54:55.640]  and is an American psycho how's that sound Obama represents the criminal
[54:55.640 --> 55:01.200]  kleptocratic class of fraud and deceit so they won't criticize that because that
[55:01.200 --> 55:08.280]  describes what he is but probably not the best term to describe Obama but this
[55:08.280 --> 55:11.280]  is a guy that goes around killing people with drones saying he's really good at
[55:11.280 --> 55:15.240]  killing people like he did it himself and this is a person overriding our
[55:15.240 --> 55:19.680]  entire Bill of Rights and Constitution he is a plague you go well Alex you say
[55:19.680 --> 55:24.680]  he's a puppet why are you saying on this because he's the front man of it all
[55:24.680 --> 55:29.880]  David Knight getting back into the FCC saying they're gonna be basically
[55:29.880 --> 55:33.180]  coming in with a new fairness doctrine to restrict free speech and put their
[55:33.180 --> 55:39.920]  spies everywhere their political correct spies continuing with your contact with
[55:39.920 --> 55:43.640]  the FCC and there's video of this now that we have I probably should just air
[55:43.640 --> 55:47.240]  your report maybe I'll do it in the next hour where they're saying it's ambush
[55:47.240 --> 55:51.760]  journalism and acting like there's the CIA that the media would dare call them
[55:51.760 --> 55:55.560]  yeah they don't want to talk to me I mean it's so bizarre that media you're
[55:55.560 --> 55:58.720]  supposed to just take their press releases like dinosaur media and repeat
[55:58.720 --> 56:04.520]  them that you would dare call them and dare want to know about their plans to
[56:04.520 --> 56:08.920]  come tell us what to do can you imagine one of these people coming to visit us
[56:08.920 --> 56:13.840]  yeah oh yeah one of the things the FCC commissioner pointed out in his op-ed piece
[56:13.840 --> 56:18.460]  it's some tar and feathers I'm sorry yeah he said the FCC has no authority to
[56:18.460 --> 56:22.080]  regulate the print media and yet they're going to be included in this study
[56:22.080 --> 56:25.960]  that they've got going on so this is much broader than their power and it's huge
[56:25.960 --> 56:31.000]  power grab it's definitely we it brings up concerns of the fairness doctrine
[56:31.000 --> 56:34.720]  because they're they're highlighting the concerns of women in media we had 10
[56:34.720 --> 56:39.040]  Democratic senators a few years ago mainly women come out and do this call for
[56:39.040 --> 56:43.000]  the fairness doctor but it also there's something else going on here too if you
[56:43.000 --> 56:46.640]  remember the voice of America and Radio Free Europe they were created at the
[56:46.640 --> 56:49.320]  beginning of the Cold War they're not gonna operate domestically this is
[56:49.320 --> 56:52.880]  really that shift and quote the Pentagon four months ago announcing they're gonna
[56:52.880 --> 56:57.040]  reach out to the media exactly and so when we look at them getting into the
[56:57.040 --> 57:00.920]  content of this stuff when they start looking closely at content when they
[57:00.920 --> 57:05.600]  start analyzing how are people putting the the news organizations together we
[57:05.600 --> 57:09.320]  should keep in mind not only the NSA but we need to understand that they're
[57:09.320 --> 57:13.240]  going to actively propagandize the American people that's what the federal
[57:13.240 --> 57:16.240]  government has and it sites oh yeah they're gonna give you a good a good
[57:16.240 --> 57:20.000]  rating if you carry a certain amount of their bull that's right that's right so
[57:20.000 --> 57:24.680]  to say that this has nothing to do with content is not true and see the FCC is
[57:24.680 --> 57:27.920]  supposed to scrupulously stay away from content but they want to talk about
[57:27.920 --> 57:31.200]  barriers to participation talk about the barriers that they set up to
[57:31.200 --> 57:35.720]  micro broadcasting or other things like that that would directly affect small
[57:35.720 --> 57:39.800]  business yeah why didn't they open up all the high def digital band the
[57:39.800 --> 57:42.280]  community like they were supposed to do they didn't do that that's right that's
[57:42.280 --> 57:45.760]  right and that's really what the FCC was there for it was there to make sure
[57:45.760 --> 57:49.520]  that people don't overrun each other as far as broadcasting frequencies and
[57:49.520 --> 57:53.720]  that sort of thing goes this brings up very troubling concerns about them
[57:53.720 --> 57:57.880]  getting involved in content which is what nobody wants to see well even the
[57:57.880 --> 58:02.000]  head of the agency says it's outrageous it is outrageous tyranny yeah and it
[58:02.000 --> 58:05.360]  shows the skies the limit once they start getting away with whatever they
[58:05.360 --> 58:08.880]  want the skies the limit David yeah that's right describe more of what's in
[58:08.880 --> 58:11.840]  the video that we're gonna post on infowars.com well one of the things we
[58:11.840 --> 58:15.320]  wanted to ask them was you know how do you define whether or not information
[58:15.320 --> 58:19.360]  how do you find information needs being met how do you measure that what's the
[58:19.360 --> 58:22.640]  cost of this study can we see the questions they wouldn't give us any
[58:22.640 --> 58:26.280]  information they absolutely shut it down we're gonna give you a prepared
[58:26.280 --> 58:29.840]  statement that's very bland in general and what they did was they changed the
[58:29.840 --> 58:32.600]  mission statement from saying they're gonna focus on the information needs of
[58:32.600 --> 58:36.920]  women and minorities to say we're gonna focus on the barriers to competition for
[58:36.920 --> 58:42.400]  small business. Wow wow amazing just and this is just a cover for their takeover
[58:42.400 --> 58:46.160]  David you want to hold over you got any more? That's pretty much everything that we got from it
[58:46.160 --> 58:49.200]  we're out of time we're out of time great job more on the news tonight 7 o'clock

[01:01:17.040 --> 01:01:24.600]  hanging and we are to quote agent Krueger you know in Elysium when he
[01:01:24.600 --> 01:01:28.400]  shoves the shard of glass on her neck she comes in and starts chewing him out
[01:01:28.400 --> 01:01:31.600]  and she goes we could be hung for this and he like stabs her in the neck he
[01:01:31.600 --> 01:01:37.080]  goes we do the hanging and my whole point is is that the people have the
[01:01:37.080 --> 01:01:44.520]  power if they ever want to figure that out and I'm not complying with anything
[01:01:44.520 --> 01:01:48.160]  else anymore I'm done with this criminal rogue filthy government and that's a

[01:03:29.720 --> 01:03:35.320]  focus my mind when I come back at the beginning of the next segment I'm gonna
[01:03:35.320 --> 01:03:39.360]  try to quantify what the human destiny I believe is and what it could be and what
[01:03:39.360 --> 01:03:43.840]  I believe the human experience truly is and just how incredibly magical it is
[01:03:43.840 --> 01:03:47.840]  I'm gonna attempt in just two or three minutes to quantify it and then I'm gonna
[01:03:47.840 --> 01:03:50.880]  open the phones up and I want to hear from you what do you think the human
[01:03:50.880 --> 01:03:55.880]  destiny is where what are you doing to resist this evil and what do you think

[01:04:46.680 --> 01:04:49.600]  there's a lot of good people in government corporations as well who just
[01:04:49.600 --> 01:04:53.760]  go along to get along we've got to rest the wheel of control away from these

[01:08:19.240 --> 01:08:22.720]  Alex Jones
[01:08:30.160 --> 01:08:37.440]  on this Friday the 21st day of February 2014 broadcasting to millions
[01:08:37.440 --> 01:08:43.960]  listening as we speak I want to talk about the nature of reality before we
[01:08:43.960 --> 01:08:52.240]  open the phone calls up here the nature of what it is to be a human we tend to
[01:08:52.240 --> 01:08:57.440]  individually have a feeling like we've been here forever and that we're never
[01:08:57.440 --> 01:09:02.440]  going to die and to be overconfident until we get older because we look around
[01:09:02.440 --> 01:09:08.800]  us and see institutions and buildings and culture and language and customs that
[01:09:08.800 --> 01:09:16.720]  took tens of thousands of years to develop on this planet with our species
[01:09:16.720 --> 01:09:22.400]  and the rights of passage in the archetypal rituals that seem so comforting
[01:09:22.400 --> 01:09:29.640]  to us that are great great great great great times a hundred grandparents went
[01:09:29.640 --> 01:09:34.720]  through as well and we now live in a time where those rituals and those
[01:09:34.720 --> 01:09:40.200]  rights and those human activities are being removed and scientifically
[01:09:40.200 --> 01:09:47.400]  dissolved and replaced with rituals of dehumanization and of consciousness
[01:09:47.400 --> 01:09:54.160]  suppression that is the great crime of the New World Order and I look at people
[01:09:54.160 --> 01:09:57.360]  who say they're bored or there's nothing going on in the world that's
[01:09:57.360 --> 01:10:03.080]  because they are totally bought in to the mainline cosmology of sports and the
[01:10:03.080 --> 01:10:10.840]  drama and the movies and the celebrity that the 99.99999% of people will
[01:10:10.840 --> 01:10:15.360]  ever be part of and they imagine that it's like some golden field of the
[01:10:15.360 --> 01:10:22.600]  demigods an Elysium that they someday might be able to join if they play
[01:10:22.600 --> 01:10:27.160]  along with the system and that that is where the fulfillment lies while
[01:10:27.160 --> 01:10:34.840]  fulfillment in the human process is waiting for you accessing the archetypes
[01:10:34.840 --> 01:10:41.800]  that access the epigenetics on record and the race memory proven in all major
[01:10:41.800 --> 01:10:47.840]  mammal species and the strongest in humans you want to watch a movie how
[01:10:47.840 --> 01:10:53.360]  about you watch one from 5,000 years ago where do you think all these instincts
[01:10:53.360 --> 01:10:58.480]  come from why are you scared at night going in and out of your door why is
[01:10:58.480 --> 01:11:02.400]  their anxiety why do children imagine monsters with big red eyes and big teeth
[01:11:02.400 --> 01:11:09.520]  that's big cats big bears all of it is there it's in chickens as well you can
[01:11:09.520 --> 01:11:16.200]  take chickens 10 generations indoors with no stimuli and have a cloud go over
[01:11:16.200 --> 01:11:21.640]  projected on the ceiling and have 10 generations later they've seen nothing
[01:11:21.640 --> 01:11:27.680]  project a cloud project a plane but have a hawk fly over they all run
[01:11:27.680 --> 01:11:33.840]  screaming and hiding squawking it's the same thing they're trying to take all
[01:11:33.840 --> 01:11:40.200]  those basic instincts away from you that in the DNA in the neurons in your
[01:11:40.200 --> 01:11:45.880]  cells your cells have a memory that has now been proven what all the ancients
[01:11:45.880 --> 01:11:51.160]  and what all the sages said is now been mathematically scientifically proven we
[01:11:51.160 --> 01:11:59.960]  are a collective mass tissue species where we are individuals but together we
[01:11:59.960 --> 01:12:09.480]  form a giant group collective organism a mass organism that at a sixth sense
[01:12:09.480 --> 01:12:13.000]  level they've proven they've done this with rhesus monkeys where you'll have
[01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:16.160]  one island once you teach a certain amount of monkeys the trick on one
[01:12:16.160 --> 01:12:22.440]  island they will magically suddenly that day learn it on the next island a
[01:12:22.440 --> 01:12:26.920]  hundred 200 times faster you might take them two years to teach the monkeys how
[01:12:26.920 --> 01:12:31.880]  to do a trick how to get something out of a bottle but the day they start
[01:12:31.880 --> 01:12:35.600]  learning it over here you can hand it to the other monkeys on another island and
[01:12:35.600 --> 01:12:40.160]  they know how to do it now what is that no one knows folks there's a lot going
[01:12:40.160 --> 01:12:47.760]  on here and the globalists are aware of all that and are trying to jack into it
[01:12:47.760 --> 01:12:53.240]  and hack it and block it that's why they don't want you to be a natural man they
[01:12:53.240 --> 01:12:56.040]  don't want to be a natural woman they don't want to follow your natural
[01:12:56.040 --> 01:13:01.360]  instincts that will fulfill you that will satisfy you they don't want you to go
[01:13:01.360 --> 01:13:05.280]  through the rights and rituals of manhood they don't want you to be feminine
[01:13:05.280 --> 01:13:08.320]  if you're a woman they don't want you to go through those because you will be
[01:13:08.320 --> 01:13:13.960]  fulfilled you will mature and you will activate all of the pre-programming that
[01:13:13.960 --> 01:13:18.600]  the Creator put into us because we are free will we do have a consciousness
[01:13:18.600 --> 01:13:23.800]  above all this that rides it but there are so many levels to our life so many
[01:13:23.800 --> 01:13:29.880]  organs and cell systems and in mitochondrial DNA and DNA and RNA
[01:13:29.880 --> 01:13:35.160]  interfaces and electrochemical processes where it's all interfacing inside
[01:13:35.160 --> 01:13:41.520]  your body and with other people visually audibly through the tactile touch
[01:13:41.520 --> 01:13:50.400]  through the smell through the taste I am all those that came before me their
[01:13:50.400 --> 01:13:57.400]  desperate battle to survive is now manifest in me and in you I can feel
[01:13:57.400 --> 01:14:03.480]  their struggle and their strength they are raging and seething for us to succeed
[01:14:03.480 --> 01:14:09.640]  all of them stacked on top of one another now with us and then I look at the
[01:14:09.640 --> 01:14:14.400]  next generation and I then join my ancestors from that perspective looking
[01:14:14.400 --> 01:14:18.840]  out only wanting us to colonize space only wanting us not to destroy
[01:14:18.840 --> 01:14:25.880]  ourselves only wanting us to succeed and then I see the greed the animus the the
[01:14:25.880 --> 01:14:31.200]  evil the people turned to the jungle in this corrupt system to survive believing
[01:14:31.200 --> 01:14:35.840]  evil and treachery is what has empowered them and called bloodedness when it is
[01:14:35.840 --> 01:14:43.080]  what has held us back to absolutely going to the next level so I wanted
[01:14:43.080 --> 01:14:48.360]  today to just speak about the human experience life is like a hundred yard
[01:14:48.360 --> 01:14:56.240]  dash where you're born explosively into the world and your body begins to grow
[01:14:56.240 --> 01:14:59.880]  and you begin to take on all this information and the trials and the
[01:14:59.880 --> 01:15:04.720]  tribulations and all the new things and then the viruses the bacteria and the
[01:15:04.720 --> 01:15:10.520]  language and the culture and you're bombarded and you race right to the end
[01:15:10.520 --> 01:15:15.440]  huh and then boom the next generation takes the baton and it's all these
[01:15:15.440 --> 01:15:24.040]  explosive generations back at 300 back in Greece right through the Alamo all
[01:15:24.040 --> 01:15:29.080]  through the billions of experiences all the legends all the all the all the men
[01:15:29.080 --> 01:15:32.920]  all the women all the people that fought and died all the honorable all the brave
[01:15:32.920 --> 01:15:37.480]  all the wicked all the evil all the backstabbing this one was strong this
[01:15:37.480 --> 01:15:43.440]  one was brave this one was bold this one was lucky there at the dark tower
[01:15:43.440 --> 01:15:47.880]  child Rowland came and for a brief moment the hills lit up with fire and I
[01:15:47.880 --> 01:15:59.800]  could see them all and I was with them dauntless lifted the horn to his mouth
[01:15:59.800 --> 01:16:06.800]  in blue that's what it's all about ladies and gentlemen and when you figure
[01:16:06.800 --> 01:16:10.800]  that out that you are all those people that came before you and you are all
[01:16:10.800 --> 01:16:13.600]  those people that come after you you're not going to worry about dying anymore
[01:16:13.600 --> 01:16:17.720]  yourself you're gonna worry about the consciousness you've got dying and the
[01:16:17.720 --> 01:16:23.320]  rituals that had been carried out by our ancestors not being carried out into
[01:16:23.320 --> 01:16:28.080]  the future because then those rituals are needed in all the psychology in all
[01:16:28.080 --> 01:16:33.600]  the anthropology in all the sociology in all of it you need those to then
[01:16:33.600 --> 01:16:41.560]  activate all of the DNA strands the 96% they said was junk that isn't that
[01:16:41.560 --> 01:16:47.560]  literally then resonates and activates the data packets the compressed data
[01:16:47.560 --> 01:16:52.800]  information we need to go into the future and believe me we need all of
[01:16:52.800 --> 01:16:56.400]  those struggles and all of that information to go into the future the
[01:16:56.400 --> 01:17:00.000]  globalists are trying to block us off from that information because that is the
[01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:05.760]  answer so there my friends really is the nature of reality is that think about
[01:17:05.760 --> 01:17:09.160]  how we're alive for the short moment interfacing with all this art
[01:17:09.160 --> 01:17:14.080]  literature and culture that our species has created how can you not love
[01:17:14.080 --> 01:17:18.880]  humanity and want to embrace humanity for your brief moment of consciousness
[01:17:18.880 --> 01:17:26.040]  before you are reuploaded into the next wave and then there's a spiritual living
[01:17:26.040 --> 01:17:30.280]  forever as well that is certainly real and is the next level God gives us life
[01:17:30.280 --> 01:17:34.960]  and creation on so many levels that's what I've become to understand we live
[01:17:34.960 --> 01:17:39.140]  on through our children the surest way of living forever we live on to the
[01:17:39.140 --> 01:17:43.400]  DNA we live on through the art through the literature through the ideas and the
[01:17:43.400 --> 01:17:49.120]  great human attribute the true sign of being human is not just forming our own
[01:17:49.120 --> 01:17:52.560]  environment not just taking control of our own development that is the
[01:17:52.560 --> 01:18:00.040]  foundation but the great spark the Promethean fire is the desire to
[01:18:00.040 --> 01:18:06.760]  transmit loving knowledge on to the next generation and to build up the young
[01:18:06.760 --> 01:18:12.440]  of the future because they are us we are them they will become the elders and
[01:18:12.440 --> 01:18:22.960]  fall like dust into the ground this is the great truth this is why you uphold
[01:18:22.960 --> 01:18:26.760]  your family name this is why you try to be an honorable good person this is why
[01:18:26.760 --> 01:18:31.040]  you have a conscience is this good for humanity and the globalists come with a
[01:18:31.040 --> 01:18:35.040]  counterfeit and say yes we are the collectivist because we are collectivist
[01:18:35.040 --> 01:18:39.960]  and they come and they say we're going to create a collectivism to help humanity
[01:18:39.960 --> 01:18:43.800]  when they're actually centralized parasites that hate humanity that are
[01:18:43.800 --> 01:18:49.080]  using a collectivism to shudder and block and gouge out the eyes and the in
[01:18:49.080 --> 01:18:56.200]  the ears and the nose and the soul of humanity in the sixth sense show that we
[01:18:56.200 --> 01:19:02.120]  cannot be individuals we are individuals who are part of a collective and are
[01:19:02.120 --> 01:19:06.160]  meant to operate through free association and free will to take the
[01:19:06.160 --> 01:19:11.160]  greatest attributes of humanity through free association to vote in free
[01:19:11.160 --> 01:19:16.360]  association to uphold the greatest of our people to then make that the model
[01:19:16.360 --> 01:19:23.360]  for others as a stairway to build even greater systems into the future this is
[01:19:23.360 --> 01:19:28.760]  the human experience this is the great goal this is what can free us not
[01:19:28.760 --> 01:19:34.600]  hollywood not fame not fake fortune none of it but building a true world
[01:19:34.600 --> 01:19:40.480]  building a better world building a free world based on due process based on
[01:19:40.480 --> 01:19:48.680]  honor based on our fathers and our mothers that came before us we're gonna
[01:19:48.680 --> 01:19:53.080]  come back and we're gonna go to your phone calls what do you think's coming

[01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:33.360]  just some of the news that we're gonna be detailing more coming up but let's go
[01:24:33.360 --> 01:24:36.800]  to your phone calls again I'm asking the question what are the greatest crimes
[01:24:36.800 --> 01:24:44.600]  of the globalist a and b what are you doing to fight them and then see where
[01:24:44.600 --> 01:24:50.400]  do you really see the world going because the future destiny is being shaped
[01:24:50.400 --> 01:24:54.120]  to a great extent right now it's just epic times is what I'm trying to get at
[01:24:54.120 --> 01:24:59.960]  here absolutely epic times we live in and I hope that's not lost on people for
[01:24:59.960 --> 01:25:03.840]  the forest because there's so much stuff going on but when you look at it in a
[01:25:03.840 --> 01:25:07.240]  larger context it's just amazing there's a lot of good things happening as well
[01:25:07.240 --> 01:25:14.080]  Billy in Michigan then Michael DC Tom Rusty and others go ahead you're on the
[01:25:14.080 --> 01:25:20.560]  air belt hey how's it going Alex yeah greatest crime would probably be the
[01:25:20.560 --> 01:25:27.160]  hijacking of the you know the banking system and how it's been done since way
[01:25:27.160 --> 01:25:34.080]  back how they funded both sides of wars and and all that stuff where do I see
[01:25:34.080 --> 01:25:41.440]  humanity going I'm actually quite optimistic I think life is cyclical
[01:25:41.440 --> 01:25:46.800]  it has its ups and downs it's reaching a point where it's just gonna probably just
[01:25:46.800 --> 01:25:55.440]  reset and go back and what am I doing I'm just resisting I'm not
[01:25:55.440 --> 01:26:03.400]  complaining I'm definitely not advocating any type of you know armed
[01:26:03.400 --> 01:26:07.840]  resisting a revolution at this point I think that's exactly what they want I
[01:26:07.840 --> 01:26:12.120]  would I would encourage people I've seen especially your listeners in the
[01:26:12.120 --> 01:26:16.440]  common sense sessions sections a lot of tough guys you know is we got to do this
[01:26:16.440 --> 01:26:24.440]  got to know what you got to do first is not let them have your mind your body
[01:26:24.440 --> 01:26:32.560]  you know your soul once you get all that good and all of humanity does that you
[01:26:32.560 --> 01:26:38.200]  don't need an armed revolution that's right if we just withdraw our consent
[01:26:38.200 --> 01:26:42.040]  from the system it will fold great points I mean here's an example they
[01:26:42.040 --> 01:26:45.760]  can't give in to us on removing fluoride from the water even though the
[01:26:45.760 --> 01:26:49.960]  government now admits it's poison they can't give in to us on repealing
[01:26:49.960 --> 01:26:53.240]  Obamacare even though it's an admitted fraud they can't give in to us on
[01:26:53.240 --> 01:26:55.800]  anything like the Second Amendment even though it's admitted at lowest crime
[01:26:55.800 --> 01:27:01.520]  because then their whole house of cards falls you pull one or two cards out of
[01:27:01.520 --> 01:27:06.920]  here it goes down they put on this whole act of invincibility infallibility all
[01:27:06.920 --> 01:27:12.600]  this power because what they're doing is very unnatural the globalists admit
[01:27:12.600 --> 01:27:16.840]  many of their own white papers their problem is there's so much wealth
[01:27:16.840 --> 01:27:21.440]  worldwide and and and the manufacturing and the industry we should be working
[01:27:21.440 --> 01:27:26.720]  two days a week and living like kings but they want artificial scarcity and
[01:27:26.720 --> 01:27:31.000]  that's what agenda 21 is and you ever get the message out to the main line
[01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:36.280]  working class that the left wants to make them poor to control them and then
[01:27:36.280 --> 01:27:39.200]  show them where they said it and that the republicans want corporations
[01:27:39.200 --> 01:27:44.040]  totally above the law to do whatever they want and you ever bring people
[01:27:44.040 --> 01:27:50.160]  together on a populist system of real transparency and real level playing
[01:27:50.160 --> 01:27:53.680]  field it's over for the establishment and that's what I want to do is just
[01:27:53.680 --> 01:28:00.720]  unify people around common sense Michael in North Carolina thanks for calling in
[01:28:00.720 --> 01:28:06.800]  your own the air hey Alex thanks for taking my call appreciate you mentioning
[01:28:06.800 --> 01:28:10.200]  the fluoride issue because I think that's probably one of the greatest crimes
[01:28:10.200 --> 01:28:17.800]  of the New World Order and I'll tell you why as you know drinking fluoride lowers
[01:28:17.800 --> 01:28:23.280]  the intelligent quotient of everyone who drinks it that's according to Harvard
[01:28:23.280 --> 01:28:27.440]  and the federal government and Time Magazine this week again Time Magazine
[01:28:27.440 --> 01:28:32.560]  actually last Friday admits fluoride is brain damaged the country but again why
[01:28:32.560 --> 01:28:36.200]  do you think that came out because you can't hide it anymore go ahead and I
[01:28:36.200 --> 01:28:41.600]  don't think people really grasp how significant that is because when the
[01:28:41.600 --> 01:28:47.240]  population is I too has been dropped by even five or ten points how many
[01:28:47.240 --> 01:28:52.640]  inventions does that represent that the literal value of the country goes down
[01:28:52.640 --> 01:28:56.600]  right exactly and then the other issue is you know you're talking about
[01:28:56.600 --> 01:29:03.840]  consciousness and our human experience well you know water is so important to
[01:29:03.840 --> 01:29:08.800]  that because on a molecular level we're like 70 to 90 percent water I know
[01:29:08.800 --> 01:29:14.880]  Mandarin and now they put it in kids ice cream I mean the fluoride right and so
[01:29:14.880 --> 01:29:20.280]  um you know there's so many different crimes and I just picked one and that's
[01:29:20.280 --> 01:29:25.640]  fluoride and in the anti-fluoride thing and you would just I mean you of all
[01:29:25.640 --> 01:29:30.880]  people would not be amazed at how much criticism one gets for picking an issue
[01:29:30.880 --> 01:29:37.520]  and just fighting it but it's it's really amazing how common it is for
[01:29:37.520 --> 01:29:42.040]  people to criticize and attack you oh yeah I'm gonna talk about that when I
[01:29:42.040 --> 01:29:45.720]  come back but that's how it always is for a patriot in the beginning well
[01:29:45.720 --> 01:29:52.240]  they're right back stay with us we're on the March the Empire's on the run
[01:29:52.240 --> 01:29:57.320]  Alex Jones and the GCN radio network

[01:33:41.440 --> 01:33:45.160]  fake statistics last year that in repost that record numbers of Americans
[01:33:45.160 --> 01:33:49.200]  don't own guns now I went look at all the mainline statistics that was the
[01:33:49.200 --> 01:33:53.480]  opposite gun ownership is the highest level it's been in the last 100 years
[01:33:53.480 --> 01:33:58.200]  and there's another article out on that today from Bloomberg record us gun
[01:33:58.200 --> 01:34:04.960]  production as Obama demonized on the issue writes the offshore banking
[01:34:04.960 --> 01:34:11.200]  cartel operative publication Bloomberg US gun makers led by strum Luger and
[01:34:11.200 --> 01:34:16.840]  co and smith and wesson holding group turned out a record number of firearms
[01:34:16.840 --> 01:34:21.440]  government data showed continuing a trend of robust production during
[01:34:21.440 --> 01:34:27.920]  democrat presidencies more than 8.57 million guns were produced in 2012
[01:34:27.920 --> 01:34:32.360]  they're always a year behind up 31% and they trend through the next year they
[01:34:32.360 --> 01:34:37.560]  think it's up even more and they go on to say but they didn't produce that much
[01:34:37.560 --> 01:34:42.840]  under George W. Bush advocates of both sides of gun control debate said
[01:34:42.840 --> 01:34:46.440]  manufacturers are meeting demand fueled by concerns among gun owners the
[01:34:46.440 --> 01:34:49.280]  democratic presidents are more willing to limit firearms sales and
[01:34:49.280 --> 01:34:53.400]  republicans after years of steering clear the issue Obama pressed
[01:34:53.400 --> 01:34:57.760]  unsuccessfully last year for stricter gun measures in the wake of 2012 massacre
[01:34:57.760 --> 01:35:01.520]  it's Sandy Hook Elementary in Newtown Connecticut if you believe any of that
[01:35:01.520 --> 01:35:09.520]  so there you go expanding collections no gun ownership is going up and they
[01:35:09.520 --> 01:35:15.040]  can't stand it I run to people all the time around to some last night who were
[01:35:15.040 --> 01:35:19.320]  big liberals who lived in San Francisco and heard the show many years ago and
[01:35:19.320 --> 01:35:24.080]  woke up and then woke up others and said most of former liberals they knew
[01:35:24.080 --> 01:35:29.000]  aren't conservatives now they're just more libertarians and that's it I mean
[01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:34.840]  you just want freedom and you believe in individual freedom and you don't follow
[01:35:34.840 --> 01:35:39.040]  this orthodoxy of one of the republicans or the democrats say and all the
[01:35:39.040 --> 01:35:44.280]  numbers show that is the real future now they've got the new host of the
[01:35:44.280 --> 01:35:55.200]  tonight show Jimmy Fallon and Michelle Obama or the late night show and Michelle
[01:35:55.200 --> 01:36:02.080]  Obama was on there calling young people quote knuckleheads and it's all this
[01:36:02.080 --> 01:36:10.080]  joke of you know we've got knuckleheads out there that have got to be you know
[01:36:10.080 --> 01:36:12.920]  dealt with because they get at a party and cut their finger and their dance
[01:36:12.920 --> 01:36:16.840]  around bleeding you know these lazy young people they don't have their
[01:36:16.840 --> 01:36:21.760]  health care and it's always authoritarian blobs that count on the young
[01:36:21.760 --> 01:36:25.240]  people that join the military and go be putting a meat grinder or who they count
[01:36:25.240 --> 01:36:28.720]  on going to buy the Obamacare that oh it's a really good deal yeah it's only
[01:36:28.720 --> 01:36:31.320]  five times what it would have been a few years ago for you to buy it at the age
[01:36:31.320 --> 01:36:36.880]  of 18 but they don't know and it's just an absolute screw job for young people
[01:36:36.880 --> 01:36:40.600]  inducting them just like they get young people to go buy college you know
[01:36:40.600 --> 01:36:44.320]  tuition and you know go pay for a college degree in most cases it's
[01:36:44.320 --> 01:36:49.760]  worthless nowadays so you're going to college to learn how to build buggy whips
[01:36:49.760 --> 01:36:53.000]  or something right before the automobiles invented it's just the whole
[01:36:53.000 --> 01:37:04.480]  world's changing the charge politics of late night TV political reports so that
[01:37:04.480 --> 01:37:10.440]  is just some of the news that we're getting to the the the changed politics
[01:37:10.440 --> 01:37:18.240]  a DC is now a safe zone on new tonight show that's right with Michelle Obama
[01:37:18.240 --> 01:37:25.360]  and here she is talking about the knucklehead moron constituents at least
[01:37:25.360 --> 01:37:30.600]  you didn't go as far as the head of Facebook Zuckerberg calling his users
[01:37:30.600 --> 01:37:35.640]  yeah they trust us they're a bunch of dumb efforts it's all very funny to him
[01:37:35.640 --> 01:37:41.080]  so let's go ahead and go to Michelle oh here aka the snapping turtle thanks to
[01:37:41.080 --> 01:37:44.640]  the Affordable Care Act young people can stay on their parents insurance until
[01:37:44.640 --> 01:37:49.560]  they're 26 but once they hit 26 they're on their own and a lot of young people
[01:37:49.560 --> 01:37:55.040]  think they're invincible but the truth is young people are knuckleheads you know
[01:37:55.040 --> 01:37:59.040]  they're the ones who were cooking for the first time and slice their finger
[01:37:59.040 --> 01:38:06.520]  open they're dancing on the bar stool there young people yeah I love how 26
[01:38:06.520 --> 01:38:11.880]  now is a dumb young knucklehead cooking for the first time and I was cooking when
[01:38:11.880 --> 01:38:16.880]  I was four or five years old and notice they come out now they go oh the new
[01:38:16.880 --> 01:38:20.040]  teenagers 25 they had that study two weeks ago

[01:38:25.040 --> 01:38:31.440]  kid and you know watch your TV shows and your dramas and this is a whole world
[01:38:31.440 --> 01:38:37.960]  in crisis an incredibly decadent decaying society with a bunch of hard
[01:38:37.960 --> 01:38:42.240]  working middle-class and blue-collar folks being squeezed with a bunch of
[01:38:42.240 --> 01:38:47.080]  welfare people and socialists and criminals on one side and a bunch of
[01:38:47.080 --> 01:38:50.440]  rich elites that got rich most of the time off government contracts and
[01:38:50.440 --> 01:38:54.520]  insider deals waging war against any independent money so they can have a
[01:38:54.520 --> 01:38:59.720]  monopoly as they destroy the only engine they've got of any productivity now the
[01:38:59.720 --> 01:39:06.120]  toll-free number to join us first-time callers on solutions what you're doing
[01:39:06.120 --> 01:39:08.760]  to counter the globalist tyranny and what you think their greatest crimes
[01:39:08.760 --> 01:39:12.400]  are and what your gut tells you about the future of humanity now we've had
[01:39:12.400 --> 01:39:16.400]  some great callers here we were just talking to the caller about fluoride
[01:39:16.400 --> 01:39:21.600]  being a crime it's on record it lowers IQ seven and twenty points depending on
[01:39:21.600 --> 01:39:27.600]  what area you live in and how how much they put in the water and at the same
[01:39:27.600 --> 01:39:32.520]  time you've got all these other things being put in the food and water for
[01:39:32.520 --> 01:39:36.360]  social control and that just shows you we're not in Kansas we're more of a
[01:39:36.360 --> 01:39:42.240]  matrix dystopic it's an attempt to bring in a dystopic control grid that's why
[01:39:42.240 --> 01:39:45.680]  there's so much good still because it's not a total dystopia they're not in
[01:39:45.680 --> 01:39:49.920]  control yet but they're trying to be god with the panopticonic total face
[01:39:49.920 --> 01:39:55.080]  scanning surveillance grid cradle to grave microchips in the pills you take
[01:39:55.080 --> 01:40:02.920]  surveillance blimps drones neighborhood spies FCC in the print newsrooms on and
[01:40:02.920 --> 01:40:08.760]  on and on I mean every form of tyranny on steroids metastasizing at light year
[01:40:08.760 --> 01:40:13.800]  speed eight hundred two five nine nine two three one is the toll for a number
[01:40:13.800 --> 01:40:17.880]  to join us now we're gonna take these calls quick get ready DC calling from
[01:40:17.880 --> 01:40:22.640]  Canada you're on the air go ahead hi Alex can you hear me yes I can loud and
[01:40:22.640 --> 01:40:28.600]  clear fantastic so your first point was their greatest crimes I mean their lives
[01:40:28.600 --> 01:40:34.080]  are just so big they're so bold they're so unrepentant and so pervasive I mean
[01:40:34.080 --> 01:40:37.280]  it's like you always say it's a scientifically designed system for total
[01:40:37.280 --> 01:40:43.000]  control I have a hard time putting my finger on their biggest crime I think
[01:40:43.000 --> 01:40:46.640]  it is shuttering human potential and poisoning of food and water supply to
[01:40:46.640 --> 01:40:52.160]  create a poison fog of soft kill to control us I tend to think that last
[01:40:52.160 --> 01:40:57.000]  caller was correct so they could then sell a boarding our next generation and
[01:40:57.000 --> 01:41:03.920]  then two plus two equals five common core I mean it their greatest crime is
[01:41:03.920 --> 01:41:10.400]  their mindset to dumb us down ahead of extermination absolutely I'd agree with
[01:41:10.400 --> 01:41:15.080]  that you also asked well what we're doing what am I doing well I rescinded my
[01:41:15.080 --> 01:41:18.800]  consent to be governed by the criminal Canadian government over a decade ago when
[01:41:18.800 --> 01:41:22.480]  we went into Afghanistan I said that's it I'm not giving you any more of my money
[01:41:22.480 --> 01:41:26.000]  I'm not giving you any more of my consent I'm not giving you any power
[01:41:26.000 --> 01:41:31.120]  whatsoever I live as underground as possible without actually being a hermit
[01:41:31.120 --> 01:41:34.680]  in the woods I don't watch commercial television and I'm not what they would
[01:41:34.680 --> 01:41:39.000]  call a good consumer my plan for the near future is a sailboat in the Cook
[01:41:39.000 --> 01:41:43.520]  Islands and that kind of ties into your third question you know what do we see
[01:41:43.520 --> 01:41:48.040]  for the future well I've pretty much lost all hope for the average Joe out there
[01:41:48.040 --> 01:41:53.080]  they're so dumbed and so numbed that I have a hard time mustering the energy to
[01:41:53.080 --> 01:41:57.880]  wake people up anymore I spent ten years waking people up around me and I just
[01:41:57.880 --> 01:42:03.360]  kind of burnt out you know I won on one people every once in a while if I if they
[01:42:03.360 --> 01:42:08.080]  seem receptive but I just I just can't get out there and do it anymore I just
[01:42:08.080 --> 01:42:13.120]  got so tired and so burnt out and it just makes me so sad just to just bump up
[01:42:13.120 --> 01:42:16.080]  against the zombie well that's why it's fun to run around at night sticking
[01:42:16.080 --> 01:42:19.880]  bumper stickers up everywhere climb up power poles with a baseball bat and beat
[01:42:19.880 --> 01:42:23.360]  up cameras that's the amount same people should do that I just had a dream
[01:42:23.360 --> 01:42:29.200]  where you get really energized when you do that I had to wipe the butt the mud
[01:42:29.200 --> 01:42:37.440]  off my boots but from the dream but the point was is the point is is that is
[01:42:37.440 --> 01:42:41.080]  that I understand it's very frustrating when you really know what's going on you
[01:42:41.080 --> 01:42:44.360]  know you're right you've read all their own admissions you see it and then people
[01:42:44.360 --> 01:42:46.880]  laugh at you but here's what's gonna happen you're gonna have people go to
[01:42:46.880 --> 01:42:51.200]  reservations by themselves their own towns their own cities their own areas
[01:42:51.200 --> 01:42:57.200]  where people do farm they do ranch they do barter they do value freedom and
[01:42:57.200 --> 01:43:01.800]  you're gonna then have such prosperity in those areas Texas isn't perfect but
[01:43:01.800 --> 01:43:05.520]  it's kind of a microcosm of that compared to California to where all those
[01:43:05.520 --> 01:43:09.640]  that have already zombied and pillaged their area will then come to your area
[01:43:09.640 --> 01:43:13.960]  and there's gonna have to be the free association of saying in these new
[01:43:13.960 --> 01:43:20.280]  Liberty towns that no you cannot come here there is no welfare here there is
[01:43:20.280 --> 01:43:25.000]  no title tell squads here there is no gun control here and they're going to try
[01:43:25.000 --> 01:43:32.360]  to then basically use the votes of the larger states and federal government try
[01:43:32.360 --> 01:43:38.280]  to veto us having freedoms but great call bottom line DC how do you see it
[01:43:38.280 --> 01:43:44.880]  all ending in your gut well not well at least for large portions of North
[01:43:44.880 --> 01:43:50.280]  America I mean if Texas ever secedes I will be the first one on the shores
[01:43:50.280 --> 01:43:58.000]  swearing my allegiance to your Constitution I guarantee it well I hear
[01:43:58.000 --> 01:44:04.120]  you it's it's a quiet a quiet a vision of the future I appreciate your call by
[01:44:04.120 --> 01:44:10.680]  the way I saw this last night Raw story basically Democrat operation that likes
[01:44:10.680 --> 01:44:15.200]  to take still shots of me ranting to make me look like a crazy person instead of
[01:44:15.200 --> 01:44:19.160]  actually looking at what I said ran the headline conspiracy theorist that means
[01:44:19.160 --> 01:44:23.680]  one that does not follow state-run media orthodoxy one that is not worshiped
[01:44:23.680 --> 01:44:27.840]  Kim Jong-il what do they call one who does not worship Kim Jong-il in North
[01:44:27.840 --> 01:44:32.520]  Korea a conspiracy theorist heretic what do they call one that does not worship
[01:44:32.520 --> 01:44:37.880]  the super state in the U.S. they call them Alex Jones but conspiracy theorist
[01:44:37.880 --> 01:44:44.440]  Alex Jones says immigrants will literally make us their slaves now if you
[01:44:44.440 --> 01:44:51.600]  go watch the full video I quote Thomas Jefferson the two wolves on a sheep on
[01:44:51.600 --> 01:44:56.960]  voting on what's for dinner is democracy if you have a pure democracy 51% of us
[01:44:56.960 --> 01:45:03.400]  could vote say in 1960 to kill every black person in America and it would then
[01:45:03.400 --> 01:45:07.880]  become the law and you could attempt it which of course would fail because big
[01:45:07.880 --> 01:45:11.240]  frontal assaults don't succeed like that it would be more like we want to help
[01:45:11.240 --> 01:45:14.000]  you in your community with some free money get the men out of your house
[01:45:14.000 --> 01:45:19.080]  bring in the social workers take these shots go in and get your legs sawed off
[01:45:19.080 --> 01:45:25.640]  now that you have diabetes she has to be done lovingly slowly but I digress it's
[01:45:25.640 --> 01:45:31.660]  well known by all mainline historians geo political analysts politicians
[01:45:31.660 --> 01:45:39.480]  statesmen that pure democracy is is the quote great howl of democracy is what
[01:45:39.480 --> 01:45:42.800]  the founders called it because you can get the mob all hyped up by some
[01:45:42.800 --> 01:45:48.280]  propagandist and they can get 51% to claim or have election fraud that we're
[01:45:48.280 --> 01:45:51.160]  going to take your property or we're going to chop all your heads off like
[01:45:51.160 --> 01:45:55.200]  the French Revolution in a republic you have a democracy that's limited where
[01:45:55.200 --> 01:45:59.760]  you elect representatives who then have courts that are over them and
[01:45:59.760 --> 01:46:04.360]  executive branches that are separated so there's a separation of power due
[01:46:04.360 --> 01:46:09.320]  process and you've got to follow the rule of law and that itself is fraught
[01:46:09.320 --> 01:46:16.320]  with peril if you don't have an active informed population but in a democracy
[01:46:16.320 --> 01:46:22.840]  51% will vote themselves the property the rights and liberties of the other
[01:46:22.840 --> 01:46:27.080]  group and you will have politicians who will promise them that for their votes
[01:46:27.080 --> 01:46:30.720]  I mean that's a fact and Ross story tries to act like that myself and
[01:46:30.720 --> 01:46:37.000]  Phyllis Schnafly constitutional lawyer we're having some some hallucination or
[01:46:37.000 --> 01:46:41.560]  something like we were talking about you know the Mad Hatter and the Tea Party or
[01:46:41.560 --> 01:46:46.560]  something like it was just incoherent gibbering that man look at these crazy
[01:46:46.560 --> 01:46:50.720]  people they claim the system and they quote us want to bring in a huge new
[01:46:50.720 --> 01:46:56.040]  voting block who will then vote to bring in total socialism to transfer wealth to
[01:46:56.040 --> 01:47:00.560]  themselves have you ever heard of something that crazy that's like saying
[01:47:00.560 --> 01:47:06.040]  that if you stuck your hand in a blender and turned it on you'd get cut that's
[01:47:06.040 --> 01:47:11.560]  okay the only thing crazier was Ted Cruz who did that filibuster for 28 hours or
[01:47:11.560 --> 01:47:15.000]  whatever who said Obamacare would raise premiums and was a giant screw job
[01:47:15.000 --> 01:47:18.840]  written by offshore insurance companies and would absolutely wreck the whole
[01:47:18.840 --> 01:47:23.480]  healthcare system I mean exactly what he said happened man is he a cook I mean
[01:47:23.480 --> 01:47:28.560]  like and that's the only tactic they've got is here's a funny picture Alex and
[01:47:28.560 --> 01:47:33.760]  man doesn't this sound weird he said that under the Democrat plan of open
[01:47:33.760 --> 01:47:38.240]  borders and democracy bringing in voting blocks who will vote so that they get
[01:47:38.240 --> 01:47:42.120]  welfare and handouts for a political payoff I mean that's what happened in
[01:47:42.120 --> 01:47:48.720]  ancient Rome under Julius Caesar but they can point at me because I'm just
[01:47:48.720 --> 01:47:53.640]  somewhat informed I mean doesn't take a rocket scientist to know that and go he
[01:47:53.640 --> 01:47:58.960]  says the illegals are gonna make him their slave now I said the political
[01:47:58.960 --> 01:48:05.760]  class is gonna bring in unlimited people to vote to carry out the absolute
[01:48:05.760 --> 01:48:09.400]  will of the globalist that is to bankrupt this country and they're gonna do
[01:48:09.400 --> 01:48:16.840]  it for chicken feed handouts and that's the story of the world story of France
[01:48:16.840 --> 01:48:22.480]  story England story of ancient Rome story of Italy today and ladies and
[01:48:22.480 --> 01:48:26.120]  gentlemen it's happening right now they don't give illegals in Mexico any
[01:48:26.120 --> 01:48:31.400]  benefits they put you it for six months to a year in a forced labor camp
[01:48:31.400 --> 01:48:39.880]  literally cutting highways with a yo-yo those things to swing to cut the grass
[01:48:39.880 --> 01:48:43.880]  or busting rocks look it up New York Times admitted it I think the headline
[01:48:43.880 --> 01:48:48.920]  was like Mexico has a bad immigration past as well like critics like we we have
[01:48:48.920 --> 01:48:53.240]  the most wide open it's like America is like a prostitute that has sex with 200
[01:48:53.240 --> 01:48:57.400]  guys a day you know to liken like like like if having an open border is like
[01:48:57.400 --> 01:49:02.400]  being a whore America is the biggest whore on the planet we haven't sex with
[01:49:02.400 --> 01:49:06.720]  200 guys a day lined up around the block Mexico doesn't have sex with one
[01:49:06.720 --> 01:49:13.600]  person a year Mexico has a chastity belt on like Fort Knox with 500
[01:49:13.600 --> 01:49:19.120]  battleships with cannons aimed in all directions okay you know what a chastity
[01:49:19.120 --> 01:49:23.640]  belt is in the Middle Ages actually have women wear these big giant actually
[01:49:23.640 --> 01:49:27.480]  cinnamon museums are disgusting I got poured out the back everything about a
[01:49:27.480 --> 01:49:31.720]  way to get in disease and your husband would leave humans were such animals
[01:49:31.720 --> 01:49:35.920]  back then and so full of hormones and natural zest that you when you left home

[02:00:56.320 --> 02:01:03.120]  ahead Tom hey Alex how you doing I'm doing all right brother I would say I
[02:01:03.120 --> 02:01:08.000]  wanted the biggest things that's happened to us is the conspiracy of the
[02:01:08.000 --> 02:01:14.840]  13th amendment that disappeared in the civil war and then after that the 14th
[02:01:14.840 --> 02:01:20.360]  amendment of the Holy Roman Empire yeah and also I have a deal of these
[02:01:20.360 --> 02:01:25.520]  illegals coming up here I don't know if it's really so much about them voting
[02:01:25.520 --> 02:01:31.040]  Democrat or them being Catholic what's your take on that a lot of people get
[02:01:31.040 --> 02:01:38.320]  obsessed with Protestant Catholic and that's why we can't ever get together
[02:01:38.320 --> 02:01:41.320]  around Liberty and defeat the New World Order because everybody obsesses over
[02:01:41.320 --> 02:01:47.320]  whether you're black or white or Catholic or Christian Protestant or agnostic
[02:01:47.320 --> 02:01:53.400]  I mean I just don't get into it I mean the Democrats want the illegals here
[02:01:53.400 --> 02:01:57.360]  because they'll vote to take the guns and they will drive down wages the big
[02:01:57.360 --> 02:02:00.880]  corporations want that that's why the Republicans are for it so that's why they
[02:02:00.880 --> 02:02:06.480]  say that that's their plan I have seen there's a lot of leftist elements in the
[02:02:06.480 --> 02:02:11.480]  Catholic Church in in Mexico that's true that are anti-gun and stuff and how
[02:02:11.480 --> 02:02:14.840]  could you be anti-gun for the general population down there that's had all
[02:02:14.840 --> 02:02:19.200]  their guns taken being oppressed by the Mexican government but there are some
[02:02:19.200 --> 02:02:23.200]  Catholic countries where they're pro-gun so I just really you know it's an
[02:02:23.200 --> 02:02:28.480]  opioid of the masses to get into the Vatican runs it Israel runs it the
[02:02:28.480 --> 02:02:34.200]  the Masons run it let me tell you who runs the New World Order corruption it's
[02:02:34.200 --> 02:02:39.360]  a philosophy and I'm just trying to sell the philosophy of Liberty and the
[02:02:39.360 --> 02:02:43.680]  philosophy of family and private property and pro-life and I'm trying to be a
[02:02:43.680 --> 02:02:48.880]  unifier not a divider but I mean go ahead I mean you think it's a plan of the
[02:02:48.880 --> 02:02:52.920]  Seventh-day Adventists have said that a lot I'd open the borders up to turn the
[02:02:52.920 --> 02:03:00.080]  US into a Catholic country and not necessarily just that I mean I I know
[02:03:00.080 --> 02:03:05.000]  the 14th Amendment is the Holy Roman 14th Amendment and what did happen to
[02:03:05.000 --> 02:03:08.920]  the 13th Amendment of the Civil War when nobody ever talks about it it just
[02:03:08.920 --> 02:03:13.960]  disappeared what do you think happened go ahead I really don't know I've
[02:03:13.960 --> 02:03:19.000]  studied into it somewhat but what do you mean the 14th Amendment of the Holy
[02:03:19.000 --> 02:03:26.080]  Roman Empire I think the 14th Amendment something set up by the Rome just the
[02:03:26.080 --> 02:03:32.480]  Jesuits well a lot of people call it sure I appreciate your call you know one
[02:03:32.480 --> 02:03:36.480]  reason I kind of have a jaundice eye towards all this Jesuit talk is that
[02:03:36.480 --> 02:03:40.760]  I've been brought up a Protestant and I don't really have any Catholics in my
[02:03:40.760 --> 02:03:42.680]  family we have a lot of friends that are Catholics I think they're really nice
[02:03:42.680 --> 02:03:47.360]  people on average and they got there doing a lot of good stuff my issue is
[02:03:47.360 --> 02:03:51.040]  I'm always accused of being some type of you know Catholic agent or a Vatican
[02:03:51.040 --> 02:03:55.200]  assassin we make that joke all because there was a black guy named Alex Jones

[02:08:13.560 --> 02:08:36.680]  disinformation it's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network we are joined as we
[02:08:36.680 --> 02:08:42.600]  enter into this third-hour broadcasting worldwide by Dr. Jerome Corsi one of the
[02:08:42.600 --> 02:08:47.560]  senior writers at world net daily and he is a PhD from Harvard in political
[02:08:47.560 --> 02:08:50.720]  science and he's worked with the State Department you name and he's a
[02:08:50.720 --> 02:08:55.800]  multi-time number one New York Times best-seller and he's got a lot of
[02:08:55.800 --> 02:09:00.160]  inside sources on what's going on we've been following very closely and I asked
[02:09:00.160 --> 02:09:04.600]  him a few months ago that as soon as he had more information to come on the show
[02:09:04.600 --> 02:09:09.320]  and so we contacted us dealing with the purge of the military that undoubtedly
[02:09:09.320 --> 02:09:13.760]  is happening now and undoubtedly is huge we've had a lot of top generals like
[02:09:13.760 --> 02:09:18.280]  Boykin former head of special forces and others go public and we've seen
[02:09:18.280 --> 02:09:22.200]  admirals forced our admirals go public saying Benghazi was staged as a fake
[02:09:22.200 --> 02:09:27.560]  kidnapping went wrong and it's all really starting to come out and now we've
[02:09:27.560 --> 02:09:32.360]  got just today as Corsi joins his former CIA official accused of misleading
[02:09:32.360 --> 02:09:35.960]  lawmakers on Benghazi that's in Fox News another one here out of the weekly
[02:09:35.960 --> 02:09:41.320]  standard lawmakers CIA number two lied to us about Benghazi well yeah of course
[02:09:41.320 --> 02:09:47.880]  they lied and the question is what is Obama going to do now and will the
[02:09:47.880 --> 02:09:51.920]  Republicans finally go after the Democrats and damage them or are they so
[02:09:51.920 --> 02:09:56.720]  wedged at the hip at the highest levels with Boehner and the rest of them that
[02:09:56.720 --> 02:10:01.960]  that they're above the law I mean that's really the question here so Dr. Corsi
[02:10:01.960 --> 02:10:06.760]  joins us with the latest breaking developments on the military purge that's
[02:10:06.760 --> 02:10:12.760]  going on so thank you for coming on doctor a go ahead oh great pleasure to
[02:10:12.760 --> 02:10:17.080]  be with you again Alex thank you so so much happening so a thanks for coming
[02:10:17.080 --> 02:10:21.440]  on be you've been studying this for every angle and world that daily has the
[02:10:21.440 --> 02:10:24.440]  connections of the generals you've been interviewing them along with Mr. Maloof
[02:10:24.440 --> 02:10:31.200]  what's really going on well I spoke to a general boykin very recently and there's
[02:10:31.200 --> 02:10:35.520]  no doubt that the Obama administration is purging the military I mean the
[02:10:35.520 --> 02:10:41.040]  replacement of generals is at an all-time high I think there were something
[02:10:41.040 --> 02:10:45.480]  like eight generals who were replaced this is general some flying officers
[02:10:45.480 --> 02:10:52.520]  replaced last year I think it were for the first term of Obama and the pace is
[02:10:52.520 --> 02:10:56.800]  accelerating the replacements the father me the most are the ones you
[02:10:56.800 --> 02:11:02.480]  mentioned there's two categories about the me the most one is these replacements
[02:11:02.480 --> 02:11:07.200]  over Benghazi starting with general ham who of course was in charge of the
[02:11:07.200 --> 02:11:12.280]  African command and general ham from the beginning was critical saying that we
[02:11:12.280 --> 02:11:17.520]  could have gotten reinforcements to Benghazi in time and then was also
[02:11:17.520 --> 02:11:25.200]  replaced general Baker who had in one of the task forces in Africa and claimed
[02:11:25.200 --> 02:11:29.680]  that we could have gotten a helicopter relief to the counselor to the Benghazi
[02:11:29.680 --> 02:11:36.840]  compound course during the surge and then the next round of replacements and
[02:11:36.840 --> 02:11:41.960]  pressure seems to be on any military with traditional values in other words
[02:11:41.960 --> 02:11:49.240]  expressing positive belief in God or not accepting the LGBT agenda and we have
[02:11:49.240 --> 02:11:52.200]  the memos they say if you're an evangelical a part of the Tea Party you
[02:11:52.200 --> 02:11:56.200]  could be brought up on court Marshall yes right exactly I mean it's being the
[02:11:56.200 --> 02:12:02.920]  the pressure now is that anyone who holds traditional values believing in the
[02:12:02.920 --> 02:12:07.160]  Constitution including the First Amendment rights of religion is suspect
[02:12:07.160 --> 02:12:15.200]  as a hater or as a denier of the rights of the LGBT community it's really
[02:12:15.200 --> 02:12:20.880]  turning the Constitution on its head such as the military is being placed into a
[02:12:20.880 --> 02:12:27.800]  bind where profession of Christian beliefs is going to be detrimental to
[02:12:27.800 --> 02:12:33.360]  career advancement and that's that's a you know that's fundamental to the
[02:12:33.360 --> 02:12:38.120]  reason we have the First Amendment is that people who are you know we should
[02:12:38.120 --> 02:12:42.320]  as citizens be able to enjoy including the military constitutional rights
[02:12:42.320 --> 02:12:46.000]  including the freedom to believe and express your well sure I mean they're
[02:12:46.000 --> 02:12:49.480]  trying to dominate reality taking the majority the American people and then
[02:12:49.480 --> 02:12:53.120]  just listing us as extremist or terrorist and we're all supposed to just
[02:12:53.120 --> 02:12:56.960]  sing from their sheet of music and you know we can laugh at this but it's not
[02:12:56.960 --> 02:13:00.600]  a laughing matter when they're purging almost the entire nuclear force there
[02:13:00.600 --> 02:13:04.080]  and I think there's more to it than just the political correctness they are I
[02:13:04.080 --> 02:13:08.200]  think I think they're thinking about a long-term coup of the government itself
[02:13:08.200 --> 02:13:11.920]  more of a soft coup not that Obama would stay in office it's just that they're
[02:13:11.920 --> 02:13:15.560]  getting all their judges all their operatives in so there's a coup of the
[02:13:15.560 --> 02:13:19.640]  bureaucracy even more than there already has been well well clearly there's a
[02:13:19.640 --> 02:13:25.560]  reduction a major reduction of the US military capacity to wage war to defend
[02:13:25.560 --> 02:13:32.280]  the country I mean I don't think we could today launch a two operations war as
[02:13:32.280 --> 02:13:37.600]  we did under George W. Bush certainly not the wars were in different theaters I
[02:13:37.600 --> 02:13:42.120]  don't see how it's possible military has been so reduced in capability the
[02:13:42.120 --> 02:13:48.080]  training has not occurred we have reduced forces across the board everyone
[02:13:48.080 --> 02:13:54.080]  the major services fewer airplanes fewer naval ships just a reduction in force
[02:13:54.080 --> 02:13:58.680]  in general and the American people aren't aware of it I mean it's a leveling
[02:13:58.680 --> 02:14:03.800]  down to the power of the United States where whoever's follows Obama is going
[02:14:03.800 --> 02:14:11.040]  to face a military that reminds me of a pre-World War one military in the
[02:14:11.040 --> 02:14:15.520]  United States just completely incapable of being a major military force in the
[02:14:15.520 --> 02:14:20.920]  world and China at the same time is ramping up we're expressing you know
[02:14:20.920 --> 02:14:26.320]  belligerent intent various controversies with Japan and our Pacific
[02:14:26.320 --> 02:14:32.360]  fleet is again in a diminished position we've got an old fleet again we've got
[02:14:32.360 --> 02:14:38.000]  a fleet that is going to be vulnerable to modern cruise missile attack I mean you
[02:14:38.000 --> 02:14:44.040]  know World War two certainly saw the rise of the carrier replacing the
[02:14:44.040 --> 02:14:49.120]  battleship well now you've got a whole new Navy configuration given technology
[02:14:49.120 --> 02:14:53.600]  and we have not developed a Navy that's really in the missile technological era
[02:14:53.600 --> 02:15:00.080]  where even Iran can sail two Navy ships to our coast unblocked unstopped
[02:15:00.080 --> 02:15:05.840]  unhindered and and those ships could be having a preparation for a EMP an
[02:15:05.840 --> 02:15:11.400]  electro you know electrical pulse EMP attack on the United States which could
[02:15:11.400 --> 02:15:15.280]  put out all your nuclear blasts explode in the high atmosphere
[02:15:15.280 --> 02:15:20.480]  electromagnetic pulse attack that could destroy all radio television internet
[02:15:20.480 --> 02:15:25.320]  communications radio communications in the United States and we're just totally
[02:15:25.320 --> 02:15:31.760]  vulnerable to these things and Russia and China are ramping up at the same time
[02:15:31.760 --> 02:15:37.640]  I want to shift gears what do you make of the whole Ukraine situation the
[02:15:37.640 --> 02:15:42.560]  Ukraine also I want to comment on the attempt of the Federal Communications
[02:15:42.560 --> 02:15:46.280]  Commission to that's where I was going next in fact let's talk about that
[02:15:46.280 --> 02:15:50.680]  Judge Napolitano on Fox and Friends called it radical new era of tyranny
[02:15:50.680 --> 02:15:55.560]  our articles up on info wars.com showing that video by Paul Watson we
[02:15:55.560 --> 02:15:59.640]  reported on this last year people didn't believe us I know WorldNet daily did we
[02:15:59.640 --> 02:16:05.040]  reported on it again last week it wasn't till Drudge picked up our article or and
[02:16:05.040 --> 02:16:09.120]  it picked up other articles they finally had covered it this week Obama is doing
[02:16:09.120 --> 02:16:14.640]  stuff so over the top people can't even believe it well and also behind a lot of
[02:16:14.640 --> 02:16:20.760]  this is this Podesta and his you know a center the Progressive Center the Podesta
[02:16:20.760 --> 02:16:28.360]  has in Washington DC this new firm that has been hired by the AFCC to go in and
[02:16:28.360 --> 02:16:33.080]  conduct supposedly this this study and this is not an academic study this is
[02:16:33.080 --> 02:16:37.720]  just a way of pressure it's a way to snoop and then create a new fake report
[02:16:37.720 --> 02:16:41.520]  to bring in the fairness doctrine precise or to circumvent the fairness
[02:16:41.520 --> 02:16:47.840]  doctrine with an even more oppressive anti-first amendment document and the
[02:16:47.840 --> 02:16:52.440]  FCC is ready to write those rules this group is called solution social
[02:16:52.440 --> 02:16:58.720]  solutions international it's a firm headed by it counts being Hispanic
[02:16:58.720 --> 02:17:06.720]  woman owned but the firm has again strong ties to Podesta and his center is
[02:17:06.720 --> 02:17:11.280]  Progressive Center in Washington DC where's it does and these are you know
[02:17:11.280 --> 02:17:16.880]  again this is not a unbiased academic study by the way I'm glad you corrected
[02:17:16.880 --> 02:17:20.880]  me it's much worse than fairness doctrine just over broadcast radio TV that
[02:17:20.880 --> 02:17:24.560]  they're they're gonna they're saying this is gonna be print media all media this
[02:17:24.560 --> 02:17:29.560]  is this is an attempt to have a new form of doctrine command which is local
[02:17:29.560 --> 02:17:36.080]  standards in other words if you're not fair to what's fairer fair means to you
[02:17:36.080 --> 02:17:40.120]  know teach five-year-old boys how to wear dresses you're not fair look at
[02:17:40.120 --> 02:17:44.040]  what happened with the Feinstein last year she said the feds want a law where
[02:17:44.040 --> 02:17:48.280]  they decide if you're a journalist or not and get protections I mean this is a
[02:17:48.280 --> 02:17:52.120]  war and they've said they want it do you expect them to actually get away with
[02:17:52.120 --> 02:17:56.280]  it well they're gonna try I mean it's the center is again you've got to go back
[02:17:56.280 --> 02:18:01.120]  to the Center for American Progress which is Podesta's main platform but
[02:18:01.120 --> 02:18:05.920]  that platform is pushing a lot of this agenda Podesta is now a White House
[02:18:05.920 --> 02:18:11.000]  counselor Obama's proceeding by administrative order and bureaucratic
[02:18:11.000 --> 02:18:16.480]  rule to impose anti-first amendment anti-second amendment anti-fourth
[02:18:16.480 --> 02:18:22.000]  amendment regulations upon the United States that do away with fundamental
[02:18:22.000 --> 02:18:26.720]  constitutional values you guys are right there in Virginia by DC I mean can you
[02:18:26.720 --> 02:18:31.800]  imagine them sending in an Obama Democrat party media matters operative
[02:18:31.800 --> 02:18:35.320]  who've already said they want to quote infiltrate and sabotage patriot media
[02:18:35.320 --> 02:18:39.360]  and I mean you cannot let these people in the building well the same with info
[02:18:39.360 --> 02:18:44.280]  wars I mean they're there info wars and W&D are both on the list to come in and
[02:18:44.280 --> 02:18:49.800]  say that we're not doing enough stories that are fair to in other words you know
[02:18:49.800 --> 02:18:56.520]  in agreement with the anti-first amendment agenda of the LGBT community
[02:18:56.520 --> 02:19:00.040]  oh yeah we are listed for those that don't know by the White House run media
[02:19:00.040 --> 02:19:04.600]  matters I mean they talk about us every day I mean and they remember that memo
[02:19:04.600 --> 02:19:08.720]  two years ago that leaked that they want to quote infiltrate our groups and say
[02:19:08.720 --> 02:19:13.600]  with W&D we're both on a target list of this and you know bait when they talk
[02:19:13.600 --> 02:19:20.480]  about you know the structural imbalance of radio or or of TV or print
[02:19:20.480 --> 02:19:24.120]  broadcasting with their sale or the internet what they're saying is you know
[02:19:24.120 --> 02:19:30.640]  we don't run enough stories that are like an Ed Schultz radio show that are
[02:19:30.640 --> 02:19:36.080]  waving the flag for the Obama administration the LGBT agenda all the
[02:19:36.080 --> 02:19:42.200]  and the left is the intolerant to let you know I think I keep going back to
[02:19:42.200 --> 02:19:48.000]  Jonah Goldberg's book on leftist fascism and people forget the Nazis were leftist
[02:19:48.000 --> 02:19:53.800]  national socialists you know you have the same kind of an idea for a corporate
[02:19:53.800 --> 02:20:00.160]  bureaucratic government multinational corporate world that Obama is trying to
[02:20:00.160 --> 02:20:05.280]  create in which there is no First Amendment there is no Second Amendment
[02:20:05.280 --> 02:20:09.080]  or Fourth Amendment no right to you know avoid unreasonable searches and
[02:20:09.080 --> 02:20:15.280]  seizures no right to bear arms no right to express an opinion which is contrary
[02:20:15.280 --> 02:20:20.480]  to the leftist socialist view of how things ought to be done otherwise your
[02:20:20.480 --> 02:20:25.560]  hate speech or you know you're you're defined as committing a crime for what
[02:20:25.560 --> 02:20:29.720]  you believe what you say and what you write I just kept this network breakers
[02:20:29.720 --> 02:20:32.440]  this is so important dr. Horsley let me ask you this question
[02:20:32.440 --> 02:20:37.640]  Obamacare comes in it's designed to totally bankrupt the country the GQ
[02:20:37.640 --> 02:20:41.440]  Emmanuel goes on Fox and admits that validates everything we've said death
[02:20:41.440 --> 02:20:46.720]  panels doubling tripling cost written by insider crony capitalists that are
[02:20:46.720 --> 02:20:50.480]  anti-free market to shut down their competition the perfect storm of
[02:20:50.480 --> 02:20:54.800]  corporate and socialist corruption coming together in a fascist model and
[02:20:54.800 --> 02:20:59.880]  instead no talk of repealing it banners up there the Republican leadership is
[02:20:59.880 --> 02:21:04.480]  going along this really shows if we can't repeal this Katie bar the door
[02:21:04.480 --> 02:21:09.080]  this is the green light why not start shutting down the alternative media why
[02:21:09.080 --> 02:21:13.200]  not set up checkpoints on highways why not have the NSA spy on everybody I
[02:21:13.200 --> 02:21:17.200]  mean haven't we reached the point that we either start impeaching or we start
[02:21:17.200 --> 02:21:22.320]  reversing or the precedent set to go over the edge well I know that the the
[02:21:22.320 --> 02:21:26.520]  Tea Party increasingly across the country and by the way the Tea Party is
[02:21:26.520 --> 02:21:32.760]  always branded as the this is the right-wing extremism as if these people
[02:21:32.760 --> 02:21:37.440]  were you know the Tea Party were out you know bomb-throwing anarchists which is
[02:21:37.440 --> 02:21:42.360]  you know these are people who care about the Constitution largely you know
[02:21:42.360 --> 02:21:47.240]  older concerned about their retirement concerned about the future of America
[02:21:47.240 --> 02:21:51.960]  where our children and grandchildren left with all this debt of the Tea Party I
[02:21:51.960 --> 02:21:56.720]  think it's beginning to part ways totally almost going to outright warfare
[02:21:56.720 --> 02:22:02.760]  against the Republican Party leadership the Tea Party is not Republican it's
[02:22:02.760 --> 02:22:08.800]  fundamentally a constitutionalist movement and it will only agree with the
[02:22:08.800 --> 02:22:15.960]  GOP to the extent the GOP supports smaller government supports reduced taxes
[02:22:15.960 --> 02:22:19.800]  and that's why we've got the Republican leadership with Obama and the big trade
[02:22:19.800 --> 02:22:23.920]  federations pooling money to destroy the Tea Party because the Tea Party is the
[02:22:23.920 --> 02:22:29.440]  only Americana resistance left and if the people figure that out it should be the
[02:22:29.440 --> 02:22:33.760]  new populist party take over the Republican Party and it's game over for
[02:22:33.760 --> 02:22:38.640]  these criminals I mean Republicans would use the cannon fodder they've got of
[02:22:38.640 --> 02:22:43.920]  how bad Obamacare is we could destroy these socialist scum but they won't do
[02:22:43.920 --> 02:22:48.640]  it dr. Corsi and it's so frustrating well largely they're in agreement see
[02:22:48.640 --> 02:22:52.600]  this is the problem the poke I wrote they got very little you read because it was
[02:22:52.600 --> 02:22:57.320]  a it was a you know I'm political scientist I did an analysis of I spent
[02:22:57.320 --> 02:23:02.240]  three weeks traveling with the Romney campaign as press traveling press and I
[02:23:02.240 --> 02:23:07.720]  wrote what went wrong you know which was an analysis of the 2012 presidential
[02:23:07.720 --> 02:23:12.800]  election the problem is when the Republicans put forward these establishment
[02:23:12.800 --> 02:23:19.440]  me too Democrat candidates like Romney or McCain or you know now they're
[02:23:19.440 --> 02:23:23.880]  supporting you know governor here in New Jersey I mean these are the whole
[02:23:23.880 --> 02:23:29.600]  ideas of these establishment Republicans which are basically big business spend
[02:23:29.600 --> 02:23:34.880]  money internationalist free trade destroy the dollar destroy US sovereignty
[02:23:34.880 --> 02:23:43.160]  I mean John Boehner I would go for a amnesty new immigration bill and a
[02:23:43.160 --> 02:23:47.520]  heartbeat and Mitch McConnell be right there behind them that's the problem the
[02:23:47.520 --> 02:23:52.840]  GOP leadership is becoming a branch of the Democratic Party that's moving to
[02:23:52.840 --> 02:24:00.960]  the left and rapidly doing so it is it is it is simply mind boggling and
[02:24:00.960 --> 02:24:04.720]  mind-blowing well as the top political scientists who I know is advised fortune
[02:24:04.720 --> 02:24:08.120]  20 companies I'm not tooting your horn people seem to know you know what you're
[02:24:08.120 --> 02:24:12.680]  talking about obviously they're running around very scared of the Tea Party
[02:24:12.680 --> 02:24:16.640]  every time we get a leaked Democrat party you know billionaire meeting they're
[02:24:16.640 --> 02:24:19.440]  worried about it I have Bilderberg connections they've been scared of it
[02:24:19.440 --> 02:24:24.160]  for six seven years that comes up at the highest global councils they're scared
[02:24:24.160 --> 02:24:29.760]  of the internet they're scared of quote highly motivated individuals passionate
[02:24:29.760 --> 02:24:34.080]  people that are into human empowerment I mean these are quotes put out by the
[02:24:34.080 --> 02:24:38.760]  Pentagon and groups you know run by the globalist of who they're scared of
[02:24:38.760 --> 02:24:44.600]  they're scared of free independent Renaissance 1776 or Thomas Jefferson true
[02:24:44.600 --> 02:24:48.000]  liberals like you and myself I mean these terms mean nothing now but we
[02:24:48.000 --> 02:24:52.520]  would be called liberals 235 years ago more guns more private property more
[02:24:52.520 --> 02:24:58.280]  family lower taxes more for us more freedom more personal decisions we're
[02:24:58.280 --> 02:25:01.560]  now being labeled the terrorist we're now being labeled the enemy because we're
[02:25:01.560 --> 02:25:09.280]  not just dumb moron collectivist where does this battle go then because it's
[02:25:09.280 --> 02:25:12.760]  just it's so incredible what does your gut tell you dr. Corsi where's this
[02:25:12.760 --> 02:25:16.040]  going well the the next thing I think is happening is coming down the pike
[02:25:16.040 --> 02:25:21.280]  fairly quickly is the complete destruction of the dollar I mean the
[02:25:21.280 --> 02:25:26.280]  inability to control our debt limit the fact that we're going to hit 20 billion
[02:25:26.280 --> 02:25:32.360]  dollar 20 trillion with a T in national debt the debt service on that is going
[02:25:32.360 --> 02:25:37.320]  to be enormous I continue to warn that the moment we quit buying our own debt
[02:25:37.320 --> 02:25:42.120]  through this QE policy the quantitative easing where the Federal Reserve the
[02:25:42.120 --> 02:25:47.440]  central bankers are buying our own debt we're just printing money you know money
[02:25:47.440 --> 02:25:51.600]  that is owned by the Federal Reserve not by the Treasury we don't own our own
[02:25:51.600 --> 02:25:57.400]  money we're paying interest on this debt that we're creating and China is
[02:25:57.400 --> 02:26:01.120]  starting to move away from the dollar very quickly just gonna collapse as soon
[02:26:01.120 --> 02:26:07.920]  as the you know as soon as the new Janet y'all ahead of the Fed says the
[02:26:07.920 --> 02:26:13.400]  sounds like she's backing off of printing money at that moment the stock
[02:26:13.400 --> 02:26:19.280]  market collapses it started to when she took over but immediately they propped
[02:26:19.280 --> 02:26:23.280]  up Janet y'all and sent her out made her say oh no no we're gonna keep printing
[02:26:23.280 --> 02:26:27.200]  money we'll keep printing money and buying debt as soon as that this is the
[02:26:27.200 --> 02:26:32.160]  biggest bubble I think ever and there's no doubt about it so how does it go down
[02:26:32.160 --> 02:26:36.600]  what are the different scenarios and and what happens when it goes down but it
[02:26:36.600 --> 02:26:41.560]  goes down the push is going to be to move to another global regional currency
[02:26:41.560 --> 02:26:46.440]  the whole idea is to say I mean and look just this past week you know President
[02:26:46.440 --> 02:26:51.040]  Obama very quietly goes down to Mexico and holds the North American summit
[02:26:51.040 --> 02:26:55.680]  leaders meeting which used to be security and prosperity partnership they're
[02:26:55.680 --> 02:27:00.640]  still pushing for free trade they're still pop pushing for North American union
[02:27:00.640 --> 02:27:06.400]  they just because we got on to it we criticized it WND criticized it in
[02:27:06.400 --> 02:27:12.920]  wars was on it we were there reporting the agenda was backed off publicly but
[02:27:12.920 --> 02:27:18.360]  it never for a second slowed down the urge to create a comparable to the EU
[02:27:18.360 --> 02:27:23.080]  North American Union to merge it all together in a transatlantic and
[02:27:23.080 --> 02:27:28.400]  trans-pacific partnership which again is slowed down because we you know have
[02:27:28.400 --> 02:27:34.120]  pointed out that the destructiveness to US jobs the loss of sovereignty and you
[02:27:34.120 --> 02:27:37.920]  know finally and some of the union groups are actually opposing these
[02:27:37.920 --> 02:27:43.720]  international trade groups are finally waking up but the point is once the
[02:27:43.720 --> 02:27:49.200]  currency collapses and there's no way wherever you know it's ever gonna pay
[02:27:49.200 --> 02:27:53.600]  back this 20 trillion dollar debt and all of all it can do is continue to
[02:27:53.600 --> 02:28:00.360]  generate no more debt more big government more control over people's
[02:28:00.360 --> 02:28:04.520]  lives more people dependent on government spending and eventually the
[02:28:04.520 --> 02:28:08.440]  whole thing collapses but if it with when the majority of the population is
[02:28:08.440 --> 02:28:13.840]  dependent on government checks then the collapse will be so frightening the
[02:28:13.840 --> 02:28:19.160]  population will want to keep it going even if that means going into a global
[02:28:19.160 --> 02:28:24.120]  governance that supersedes US national sovereign exactly they'll say we have the
[02:28:24.120 --> 02:28:30.240]  new SDR 100 trillion and new taxes as Davos called for and they'll say the
[02:28:30.240 --> 02:28:33.960]  new system will save you you'll still have your dollar it'll just be
[02:28:33.960 --> 02:28:37.880]  denominated digitally into this I have your Obama phone you'll still have your
[02:28:37.880 --> 02:28:42.080]  food stamps you'll still have your social security nothing's gonna change it's
[02:28:42.080 --> 02:28:46.160]  just you're gonna be paid in a new form of currency and the dollar is gonna be
[02:28:46.160 --> 02:28:51.640]  retired and don't listen to these tea party people in fact oh they just bomb
[02:28:51.640 --> 02:28:54.680]  something today we're gonna have to start arresting them and they'll stage
[02:28:54.680 --> 02:28:58.320]  false flags and then blame us and then by the time the majority of the
[02:28:58.320 --> 02:29:02.160]  population continues to be dummy down where the things being taught in the
[02:29:02.160 --> 02:29:09.160]  public schools today on LGBT agenda an attitude of feeling there's no
[02:29:09.160 --> 02:29:14.960]  fundamental math reading skills going on today regardless let's just say you

[02:33:38.320 --> 02:33:45.920]  we are back live ladies and gentlemen thank you so much for joining us we
[02:33:45.920 --> 02:33:48.240]  are gonna get your phone calls about of course he leaves us here in about 10
[02:33:48.240 --> 02:33:52.800]  minutes this story is up on drudgereport.com we'll show TV viewers that
[02:33:52.800 --> 02:33:57.800]  they're in the left hand column easy place to find it it's the top story up
[02:33:57.800 --> 02:34:07.680]  on info wars.com right now and the headline is man wearing pro gun t-shirt
[02:34:07.680 --> 02:34:14.200]  thrown out of voting booth election officials ejected a man from a voting
[02:34:14.200 --> 02:34:17.480]  booth because he was wearing a second amendment t-shirt there's no law saying
[02:34:17.480 --> 02:34:21.320]  you can't do that Chris Driscoll was prevented from voting at the Walter
[02:34:21.320 --> 02:34:26.000]  County Courthouse Tuesday after officials not servants claimed he was
[02:34:26.000 --> 02:34:31.480]  violating Texas election code section 85.036 which states that a person may
[02:34:31.480 --> 02:34:36.080]  not electioneer for against any candidate measure or political party
[02:34:36.080 --> 02:34:40.320]  within a hundred feet of a voting location. This is how it works now where
[02:34:40.320 --> 02:34:45.760]  they're like 501c3 they go get churches to become charities and then say you
[02:34:45.760 --> 02:34:49.520]  have no free speech when a church cannot be regulated by the federal government
[02:34:49.520 --> 02:34:52.560]  under the first amendment because they have no jurisdiction should I read the
[02:34:52.560 --> 02:34:55.640]  first amendment back to you Congress shall make no law respecting an
[02:34:55.640 --> 02:35:00.480]  establishment of religion or behaving the free exercise thereof or the press
[02:35:00.480 --> 02:35:05.800]  or the right to peaceably assemble for redress of grievances that's what's so
[02:35:05.800 --> 02:35:09.480]  frustrating about this is government has no jurisdiction so they trick you into
[02:35:09.480 --> 02:35:13.520]  a charity and then say oh you can't have a Bible at school someone might be
[02:35:13.520 --> 02:35:16.920]  offended you can't hand out Christian Christmas cards or even have a
[02:35:16.920 --> 02:35:21.320]  Christmas tree so I'm a Christian by the way it's Germanic but whatever I like
[02:35:21.320 --> 02:35:24.800]  it's part of Christmas nothing bad about that you know cold winter bringing a
[02:35:24.800 --> 02:35:28.320]  tree that smells good put candles on it the other light of you know the sun you
[02:35:28.320 --> 02:35:34.280]  want to come back in the darkest part of the winter the point is is that this is
[02:35:34.280 --> 02:35:38.840]  just so frustrating to see things like this where they expand and expand and
[02:35:38.840 --> 02:35:43.240]  expand and you see it the shopping malls now where you wear a pro gun shirt they
[02:35:43.240 --> 02:35:46.680]  walk up so sir we want you to go that the image of that gun scaring people
[02:35:46.680 --> 02:35:51.000]  meanwhile there's all these violent video games ads on the Super Bowl but you
[02:35:51.000 --> 02:35:54.200]  can't run a Daniel defense about a father's right to defend his family I
[02:35:54.200 --> 02:35:59.720]  did it the Marines and I do it now never even shows the gun bandit and you can
[02:35:59.720 --> 02:36:03.160]  show people killing each other all day long I heard a gentleman's voice over
[02:36:03.160 --> 02:36:08.360]  my shoulders say he can't vote with that shirt on you'll have to either turn it
[02:36:08.360 --> 02:36:13.000]  inside out or I believe the officials not servants use the election law to
[02:36:13.000 --> 02:36:15.880]  throw a risk a lot of the voting booth even though the search simply stated
[02:36:15.880 --> 02:36:20.600]  second amendment 79 America's original homeland security on the front without
[02:36:20.600 --> 02:36:25.200]  any mention of a political candidate or proposition this is simply an attack on
[02:36:25.200 --> 02:36:29.320]  free speech through color of law that's a good little blurb article you should
[02:36:29.320 --> 02:36:34.840]  probably add some of the other examples of that that are going on but this is
[02:36:34.840 --> 02:36:39.320]  the stuff we see where a child's told an art class draw image of your father you
[02:36:39.320 --> 02:36:43.520]  see these the news and their dad's a soldier draw picture a dab of an m16 you
[02:36:43.520 --> 02:36:47.080]  don't just get kicked out of school the police come for an image it's not
[02:36:47.080 --> 02:36:52.360]  illegal but they're doing it by fraud dr. Corsi I'm ranting here I want to get
[02:36:52.360 --> 02:36:57.400]  into Ukraine but this goes into the whole authoritarianism in my view of the
[02:36:57.400 --> 02:37:02.160]  the labels have been scrambled like in 1984 they've reduced the language down
[02:37:02.160 --> 02:37:07.120]  so much that that that these people operate like authoritarians they call
[02:37:07.120 --> 02:37:10.480]  everybody out for being a racist you know I'm a deeply racist because I'd
[02:37:10.480 --> 02:37:15.360]  agree with Obamacare MSNBC said literally those words doesn't even have
[02:37:15.360 --> 02:37:19.600]  any connection to what's really happening it's just a political weapon
[02:37:19.600 --> 02:37:23.880]  what do you say about this article well I agree I want to talk about the Texas
[02:37:23.880 --> 02:37:28.240]  election for a minute I think it's critical that John Cornyn who's running
[02:37:28.240 --> 02:37:32.920]  for reelection third term in the Senate be defeated Cornyn there's it's up you
[02:37:32.920 --> 02:37:38.040]  know the March 4th I think the voting is going on now in Texas for the before the
[02:37:38.040 --> 02:37:42.720]  March 4th primary Republican primary there are I believe seven candidates
[02:37:42.720 --> 02:37:48.760]  running against Cornyn and first of all if Cornyn gets less than 50% there'll be
[02:37:48.760 --> 02:37:53.680]  a runoff now Steve Stockman is the candidate well I think it's the closest
[02:37:53.680 --> 02:37:57.600]  of the ones running he's very close to the Tea Party he's a congressman right
[02:37:57.600 --> 02:38:03.200]  now in Texas I think he's got the chance to win I think Alex if you could
[02:38:03.200 --> 02:38:08.040]  interview Steve if you haven't already Steve is I think got the biggest chance
[02:38:08.040 --> 02:38:14.400]  to upset Cornyn and Cornyn is the Republican whip he's in the G in the
[02:38:14.400 --> 02:38:20.160]  Senate he's part of the GOP establishment he's for open borders he's for
[02:38:20.160 --> 02:38:25.800]  big deficits he is not voted against Obamacare this will this be just more
[02:38:25.800 --> 02:38:30.080]  of the same established with Republicanism and Texas has got to wake up
[02:38:30.080 --> 02:38:36.040]  and and retire John Cornyn I'm passionate about this issue because I think
[02:38:36.040 --> 02:38:40.960]  it's an opportunity where Texas can make a major statement and tell the
[02:38:40.960 --> 02:38:45.080]  Republican the establishment Republican GOP that we're tired of them that
[02:38:45.080 --> 02:38:51.120]  we're not Republicans we're basically constitutionalists and John Cornyn
[02:38:51.120 --> 02:38:56.520]  doesn't fit in the GOP party of the GOP party wants the vote of
[02:38:56.520 --> 02:39:01.160]  constitutionalists and libertarians well look at how David Dewhurst legitimate
[02:39:01.160 --> 02:39:05.360]  governor got shot down running for Senate against Cruz and Cruz didn't perfect
[02:39:05.360 --> 02:39:09.440]  but he's light years better than them then the same with Stockman Stockman is a
[02:39:09.440 --> 02:39:15.480]  guy the everybody needs to take a look at because he is gaining in the polls and
[02:39:15.480 --> 02:39:20.160]  Stockman has a strong ability in a runoff against Cornyn if Cornyn gets
[02:39:20.160 --> 02:39:28.560]  less than 50% in this GOP primary March 4th I think Stockman will beat and a
[02:39:28.560 --> 02:39:33.680]  Cornyn and has a chance to be senator just like the same route Cruz went
[02:39:33.680 --> 02:39:38.680]  through and if you can support this out Alex if people in your audience and
[02:39:38.680 --> 02:39:41.800]  Texas I've been promoting Stockman and there's a lot of good candidates there
[02:39:41.800 --> 02:39:45.640]  but he's probably the one only one that can beat Cornyn Cornyn should should
[02:39:45.640 --> 02:39:54.080]  not get reelected should not announce on you the Ukraine look it's no it's not
[02:39:54.080 --> 02:39:58.520]  coincidental the Ukraine is you know on fire right now while the Olympics are
[02:39:58.520 --> 02:40:04.400]  going on the Ukraine has wanted to move towards the West what you're seeing in
[02:40:04.400 --> 02:40:11.160]  the Olympics is an NBC produced television show it's a studio show you
[02:40:11.160 --> 02:40:15.760]  know that all the Olympics look the same whether it's this one or four years
[02:40:15.760 --> 02:40:19.000]  ago or four years in the future they're all gonna look the same they're all
[02:40:19.000 --> 02:40:22.120]  this political propaganda all look all the world gets together we can all
[02:40:22.120 --> 02:40:27.600]  compete together you don't see in Russia the suppression of rights that was put
[02:40:27.600 --> 02:40:33.080]  on to make this show go the reemergence of you know a Russia that is a
[02:40:33.080 --> 02:40:37.760]  totalitarian state you don't see the part of the opening games where all the
[02:40:37.760 --> 02:40:43.960]  communist images were displayed before all the different flags marched into the
[02:40:43.960 --> 02:40:49.800]  stadium you know all the only part is sanitized you're watching a sanitized
[02:40:49.800 --> 02:40:54.960]  television show on the Olympics there's nothing more than you know the gladiator
[02:40:54.960 --> 02:41:00.440]  games from Rome written large and made available on your television set to keep
[02:41:00.440 --> 02:41:04.040]  people entertained I mean I don't mean to demean the competition and the
[02:41:04.040 --> 02:41:08.160]  competitors the athletes are doing a good job but you've got to realize the
[02:41:08.160 --> 02:41:12.260]  political aspect of this and the people in the Ukraine as well as the people in
[02:41:12.260 --> 02:41:16.280]  Russia have been begging for someone to listen to them and their fight for their
[02:41:16.280 --> 02:41:22.760]  own rights and Obama's turning a deaf ear Obama will not support Ukraine he'll
[02:41:22.760 --> 02:41:26.840]  support Putin and he's doing it again with the weakness of the United States
[02:41:26.840 --> 02:41:30.960]  and the we getting down on our military might so we're becoming very rapidly a
[02:41:30.960 --> 02:41:36.200]  second-class power in the world which is a disgrace given the men and women who
[02:41:36.200 --> 02:41:40.240]  fought and died to preserve American freedom and that we around the world
[02:41:40.240 --> 02:41:45.680]  are going to turn a blind eye and not even speak up and champion those in
[02:41:45.680 --> 02:41:50.560]  Ukraine who want their own rights want their own government and want to be free
[02:41:50.560 --> 02:41:55.320]  of Russian domination well dr. Corsi I concur with what you're saying Putin
[02:41:55.320 --> 02:42:02.360]  it's definitely a former KGB run kleptocracy but compared to then some of
[02:42:02.360 --> 02:42:07.200]  the things Obama has been doing we know Soros is in there trying to jump on the
[02:42:07.200 --> 02:42:11.760]  back along with the Hillary's groups and the endowment for democracy and the
[02:42:11.760 --> 02:42:18.200]  rest of them to try to NGO this into the EU I'd like Ukraine to be sovereign and
[02:42:18.200 --> 02:42:24.560]  not be a part the EU the Ukraine needs to be its own nation again I'm saying
[02:42:24.560 --> 02:42:27.120]  what do they do then you don't want to be part of Russia you don't want to be part
[02:42:27.120 --> 02:42:30.920]  of the EU and then you've got Soros and them trying to foment this rebellion I
[02:42:30.920 --> 02:42:35.440]  mean we're what whose side do you get on well the EU needs to be broken up you
[02:42:35.440 --> 02:42:40.280]  and I we you're you know info wars has been strong in the story as WND has been
[02:42:40.280 --> 02:42:47.280]  the the attempt to pressure all these countries in the EU under German central
[02:42:47.280 --> 02:42:52.280]  bank control yep whole new world government idea which you know Hitler
[02:42:52.280 --> 02:42:57.560]  was the first to proclaim you've got now Germany heading in the EU and I've said
[02:42:57.560 --> 02:43:01.520]  this repeatedly with the NSA listen every conversation of the world
[02:43:01.520 --> 02:43:05.400]  transatlantic partnership this is exactly the world Hitler would have loved to
[02:43:05.400 --> 02:43:12.960]  have been born into it's what he aspired we've created it and the next thing is
[02:43:12.960 --> 02:43:17.360]  going to happen is the currency is going to be engineered to collapse when the
[02:43:17.360 --> 02:43:22.560]  dollar collapses the move to push the United States into a North American
[02:43:22.560 --> 02:43:26.640]  Union and jam it together with the EU is going to go into superdrive that's
[02:43:26.640 --> 02:43:33.280]  coming it's coming with every new budget that Obama finally puts forward another
[02:43:33.280 --> 02:43:39.000]  budget that's only going to take the 17.5 trillion dollar debt and put an
[02:43:39.000 --> 02:43:44.560]  overdrive to head towards a 20 trillion dollar national debt but there is no way
[02:43:44.560 --> 02:43:49.760]  plus the contingent liabilities the federal budget you know all the
[02:43:49.760 --> 02:43:55.040]  obligations and promises that we made on Social Security Medicare Obamacare you
[02:43:55.040 --> 02:44:00.880]  name it which probably a hundred trillion 80 to 100 trillion in unfunded
[02:44:00.880 --> 02:44:06.320]  liabilities there is no way any of this can be done it's a system designed to
[02:44:06.320 --> 02:44:11.840]  collapse and they're going to collapse it into the true new world order global
[02:44:11.840 --> 02:44:19.000]  George Soros style fascist Jenna 21 nightmare scenario in their own words
[02:44:19.000 --> 02:44:23.160]  and there's been nobody out there like yourself and myself and a handful of
[02:44:23.160 --> 02:44:27.400]  others trying to warn people and I'm not saying we're heroes and I wish there
[02:44:27.400 --> 02:44:32.720]  were more people doing it I wish people understood that we really know the
[02:44:32.720 --> 02:44:36.720]  program because we've gone and read their publications and we've watched stuff
[02:44:36.720 --> 02:44:42.200]  they wrote in Club of Rome in 1965 come true I mean to a great extent they
[02:44:42.200 --> 02:44:46.400]  really end up getting what they want the good news is I'd say they're 10 years
[02:44:46.400 --> 02:44:50.520]  behind at Brzezinski admits they're behind and the more they get behind the
[02:44:50.520 --> 02:44:54.800]  harder it's going to get but still they have enough leveraged false derivatives
[02:44:54.800 --> 02:44:59.560]  and enough fake money to be able to keep moving forward but they're starting to
[02:44:59.560 --> 02:45:04.000]  get deeper in the mud they're starting the juggernaut is slowing the awakening
[02:45:04.000 --> 02:45:08.120]  is beginning to happen and I think times on our side that's my final question in
[02:45:08.120 --> 02:45:13.480]  60 seconds if this was a ballgame team humanity versus team technocracy
[02:45:13.480 --> 02:45:17.520]  predators what's the score are we starting to gain on them where are we
[02:45:17.520 --> 02:45:22.120]  going we're starting to gain on them but the problem is Obama is going to throw
[02:45:22.120 --> 02:45:26.880]  to the dogs his ratings what he's going to do whether it's popular or unpopular
[02:45:26.880 --> 02:45:32.240]  whether Obamacare is hated or loved Obama is gonna straight and he's gonna
[02:45:32.240 --> 02:45:38.000]  put it in overdrive to put all the socialist agenda and overdrive even if
[02:45:38.000 --> 02:45:42.080]  he defeats Hillary he doesn't care it's a mission it's a mission it's a patch he
[02:45:42.080 --> 02:45:48.440]  was assigned to do a job and that job was fundamentally deconstruct the United
[02:45:48.440 --> 02:45:54.000]  States to fundamentally turn the country against the Tea Party to turn the
[02:45:54.000 --> 02:45:58.320]  country against the Constitution listen they're they're now in the news saying
[02:45:58.320 --> 02:46:02.680]  that a man and a woman together is offensive to everyone and this isn't
[02:46:02.680 --> 02:46:06.960]  tolerance we're not even allowed to exist it's gonna be that you know the
[02:46:06.960 --> 02:46:11.000]  Bible's offensive the Christianity is offensive we're going to have to fight
[02:46:11.000 --> 02:46:16.240]  it in my lifetime for things that I thought would never be challenged again
[02:46:16.240 --> 02:46:22.560]  in America where founding fathers the true liberals the true founding fathers
[02:46:22.560 --> 02:46:29.520]  who understood limited government we're now in Obama overdrive Soros overdrive
[02:46:29.520 --> 02:46:34.800]  Podesta overdrive to destroy the United States of America and we're we're the
[02:46:34.800 --> 02:46:40.480]  final hours by the way I saw just last weekend the vice president talking and
[02:46:40.480 --> 02:46:44.040]  he was he was saying you know we gotta destroy some stuff we gotta get rid of
[02:46:44.040 --> 02:46:48.800]  some stuff to rebuild it and so he said it's gonna be rough with Obamacare to a
[02:46:48.800 --> 02:46:52.960]  group of Democrats and he was admitting it just like Ezekiel Emanuel admitted
[02:46:52.960 --> 02:46:56.680]  that David that of course there's planning to wreck healthcare of course
[02:46:56.680 --> 02:47:01.560]  that's the plan and in all the lies you know you can keep your doctor you can
[02:47:01.560 --> 02:47:08.080]  you'll keep your medical all lies this whole house of cards globalism Soros
[02:47:08.080 --> 02:47:14.640]  nonsense is built on a lot of lies and unfortunately so much of the population
[02:47:14.640 --> 02:47:17.840]  has been dumbing down I mean the best thing we could do right now would be

[02:57:23.000 --> 02:57:28.320]  the earth is the biggest crime by the globalists and one of the things that
[02:57:28.320 --> 02:57:34.640]  well several of the things that I've done to counter some of their intrusion
[02:57:34.640 --> 02:57:41.760]  into my life is that I've said no to the smart meter good the meter man was just
[02:57:41.760 --> 02:57:46.360]  here reading the meter and we forced him to let you opt out in Austin just say
[02:57:46.360 --> 02:57:51.920]  no no no no no I have that little spine posted you know do not remove the
[02:57:51.920 --> 02:57:57.120]  replaces with the smart meter and that kind of thing but what happened this
[02:57:57.120 --> 02:58:01.120]  morning was that the sky was perfect I'm down here on the Gulf Coast and what
[02:58:01.120 --> 02:58:06.240]  happened this morning was sky was perfectly blue and clear and then by the
[02:58:06.240 --> 02:58:10.760]  time I went out to buy the newspaper I could see that the Kim trills had gone
[02:58:10.760 --> 02:58:17.120]  through okay that's one of the things I mentioned that while several people were
[02:58:17.120 --> 02:58:24.320]  in the store but no one commented yesterday I sent off the money to the
[02:58:24.320 --> 02:58:30.120]  Ted Cruz for the Senate I've bought several Rosa Corey books and handed those

[03:00:50.240 --> 03:00:57.480]  buddy really quickly I've had a considerable amount of time researching
[03:00:57.480 --> 03:01:05.120]  as an academic the way that the CIA has used not to war criminals since World
[03:01:05.120 --> 03:01:08.840]  War two yeah they used about about a hundred thousand of them about thirty
[03:01:08.840 --> 03:01:17.200]  thousand in serious positions and I just wanted to to know really quickly what
[03:01:17.200 --> 03:01:22.680]  I think his name is mr. LaRue the fellow you had the 90-year-old that you had on
[03:01:22.680 --> 03:01:28.720]  a couple days ago Linden LaRouche yes yes LaRouche I'm sorry he was talking
[03:01:28.720 --> 03:01:38.120]  about that the supposed freedom fighters in the Ukraine were the children of
[03:01:38.120 --> 03:01:45.280]  those Nazi collaborators that the CIA had been organizing back post World War
[03:01:45.280 --> 03:01:51.600]  two if you could define the actual evidence that he was basing those
[03:01:51.600 --> 03:01:55.440]  no no it was a generality but it was true that the Western Ukraine was pro
[03:01:55.440 --> 03:02:02.840]  Nazi and that in the gladiost day behind networks the CIA funded some of those
[03:02:02.840 --> 03:02:07.600]  groups so that that is actually on record that's what I wanted to run by you
[03:02:07.600 --> 03:02:12.040]  really quickly that that's just critical a great book to read about that is blow
[03:02:12.040 --> 03:02:16.080]  back by Christopher Simpson that goes on at length about that group in the
[03:02:16.080 --> 03:02:20.520]  Ukraine also you were just confirming yes yeah very interesting well yesterday

[03:02:26.400 --> 03:02:31.920]  second or third person and never went to calls I know Dave I need to get better
[03:02:31.920 --> 03:02:34.360]  about calls thank you brother but you got in today
[03:02:34.360 --> 03:02:39.720]  Michigan Kentucky go ahead hey how's it going Alex good brother what's on your
[03:02:39.720 --> 03:02:43.920]  mind hey man I live back here in the woods you see woman and the guns and the
[03:02:43.920 --> 03:02:48.920]  dogs of me we got live in a little town about 1200 people went up to the bank
[03:02:48.920 --> 03:02:52.120]  today of course we got a post office box since we look so far back in the woods
[03:02:52.120 --> 03:02:56.120]  and they wanted to know my physical address and I said why do you need my
[03:02:56.120 --> 03:03:01.880]  physical address they said because of the Patriot Act I'm not giving it to
[03:03:01.880 --> 03:03:04.880]  you I'm sure it doesn't matter I'm sure they got it anyway but I thought it's
[03:03:04.880 --> 03:03:09.760]  just one thing after another and it's ridiculous you know one of the things I
[03:03:09.760 --> 03:03:17.000]  thought of all these the bushes and the Clintons and all the other people in
[03:03:17.000 --> 03:03:20.120]  Congress if they like to do all this fighting overseas why don't they load
[03:03:20.120 --> 03:03:23.000]  up and all the people in Congress and they go there and start fighting when
[03:03:23.000 --> 03:03:25.880]  they come back either dead or with their arms and legs blown off maybe they'll
[03:03:25.880 --> 03:03:28.560]  feel a bit different about running over across these other countries fighting
[03:03:28.560 --> 03:03:33.640]  all the time absolutely no we've got a bunch of insulated globalist
[03:03:33.640 --> 03:03:38.840]  technocrats who have no honor no chivalry who see us all as animals who are
[03:03:38.840 --> 03:03:44.200]  just dehumanizing us training us to be slaves destroying due process trying to
[03:03:44.200 --> 03:03:50.960]  domesticate us and just manifesting pure evil like some of these last people
[03:03:50.960 --> 03:03:55.400]  you've had on some of these good talk show guys I'm we send our children over
[03:03:55.400 --> 03:03:57.800]  there and they come back all blowed apart and then they they don't want to
[03:03:57.800 --> 03:04:00.000]  even acknowledge it they don't want to help nobody they don't want to give them
[03:04:00.000 --> 03:04:04.720]  any money it's just ridiculous now they use our good will and they use our
[03:04:04.720 --> 03:04:08.320]  goodness against us and that's why we have to get angry we have to stop being
[03:04:08.320 --> 03:04:15.440]  naïve brother I appreciate your call man I'm I'm just out of time here but

[03:04:29.680 --> 03:04:35.240]  air people don't think anymore of how to do this how to do that no I agree there's
