[00:00.000 --> 00:12.320]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.320 --> 00:33.320]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:33.320 --> 00:41.120]  obviously everyone is talking about the school board shooting with Clay Duke the
[00:41.120 --> 00:46.200]  56 year old gunman who opened fire on school board members in protest against
[00:46.200 --> 00:52.080]  his wife being fired in his unemployment benefits running out and of course we
[00:52.080 --> 00:57.240]  have the footage of the security guard shooting him after he was randomly
[00:57.240 --> 01:03.000]  shooting at the school board and missing all eight shots that he fired then the
[01:03.000 --> 01:08.000]  security guard is able to shoot him and mr. Duke then turns his gun on himself
[01:08.000 --> 01:11.680]  we're not going to show you the snuff film part of it if you're watching on
[01:11.680 --> 01:17.480]  prisonplanet.tv but it is up on info wars.com and prisonplanet.com that is
[01:17.480 --> 01:22.400]  video links to footage that does not have him going ahead and shooting
[01:22.400 --> 01:26.200]  himself in the head but up until that point what an incredible story he's
[01:26.200 --> 01:29.920]  that's got so many different angles to it you have the school board female
[01:29.920 --> 01:34.200]  member coming up behind him with a big baggy purse like something out of a
[01:34.200 --> 01:37.720]  pillow fight but she had amazing courage and hitting him on the back of the head
[01:37.720 --> 01:44.640]  you've got the school board superintendent very calmly trying to talk
[01:44.640 --> 01:49.400]  the guy out of it you've got the dynamic of someone being armed stopping him
[01:49.400 --> 01:54.160]  you've got the dynamic of why is it almost always government employees or
[01:54.160 --> 01:59.240]  the husbands or wives of them in the classic cliche of going postal that go
[01:59.240 --> 02:04.200]  out and do things like this and what's gonna happen as people lose their jobs
[02:04.200 --> 02:08.880]  and as the country goes bankrupt what did Gerald Salente say yesterday he said
[02:08.880 --> 02:15.000]  that when people lose everything they lose it and he said it's gonna be off
[02:15.000 --> 02:20.800]  with their heads it's gonna be off with the heads in 2011 he's been saying that
[02:20.800 --> 02:29.880]  for the last year what did they chant in London attacking the car of the Prince
[02:29.880 --> 02:34.920]  of Wales and his wife the Duchess of Cornwall or whatever it is I mean this
[02:34.920 --> 02:40.800]  is incredible and I want to walk through the psychology and the sociology and
[02:40.800 --> 02:45.440]  really the anthropology of what happens when societies begin to shut down and
[02:45.440 --> 02:49.440]  go into serious depressions crime exploded there were a lot of problems back
[02:49.440 --> 02:58.920]  in the 1920s during the Great Depression into the 1930s 1929 through 1940 but if
[02:58.920 --> 03:03.080]  you look at the social makeup of society if you look at the fact that people on
[03:03.080 --> 03:08.440]  average are not self-sufficient most of us are it's some way or another
[03:08.440 --> 03:13.160]  decadent compared to our ancestors just because they were living closer to the
[03:13.160 --> 03:31.480]  land closer to reality this is an explosive situation that guy thank God he
[03:31.480 --> 03:38.600]  had firearm training thank God that this mainline liberal Mr. Clay Duke did
[03:38.600 --> 03:42.840]  not know how to shoot or didn't want to follow through with it a lot of soldiers
[03:42.840 --> 03:47.960]  they found up until World War two and after up close we couldn't shoot other
[03:47.960 --> 03:55.560]  so soldiers in a battle they would they would purposefully miss that's why they
[03:55.560 --> 04:00.360]  did instinctive shooting targets and then video games in the 80s and 90s to
[04:00.360 --> 04:04.560]  are now over now over night trips sit there and blow people's brains out at
[04:04.560 --> 04:07.960]  point-blank range of their order to because they've been trained to
[04:07.960 --> 04:13.040]  instinctively shoot someone who's not been trained to be a killer has a lot of
[04:13.040 --> 04:17.320]  trouble unless you're basically protecting yourself then a lot of
[04:17.320 --> 04:21.120]  people don't have trouble so that could also be the psychology but he was a big
[04:21.120 --> 04:25.760]  supporter and big fan on his website of media matters who's always trying to
[04:25.760 --> 04:29.560]  imply that I'm calling for violence that I want violence when it's the complete
[04:29.560 --> 04:34.480]  opposite so George Soros funded media matters this guy I reportedly have Paul
[04:34.480 --> 04:37.800]  Watson as an article about it at prison planet calm it's also up on info
[04:37.800 --> 04:42.840]  wars.com when Americans lose everything they start to lose it that's the article
[04:42.840 --> 04:46.160]  we're gonna play the video on the audio coming up in the next segment we've got
[04:46.160 --> 04:50.720]  Lindsey Williams his mr. X oil company executive he can fully reveal his name
[04:50.720 --> 04:53.960]  now and also tell you the intel he wasn't allowed to talk about previously
[04:53.960 --> 04:59.760]  because mr. X has officially died of cancer will be right back
[04:59.960 --> 05:04.000]  this is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a
[05:04.000 --> 05:08.360]  solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily double
[05:08.360 --> 05:12.520]  or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control
[05:12.520 --> 05:16.560]  how much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total
[05:16.560 --> 05:20.440]  government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is
[05:20.440 --> 05:24.680]  coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously
[05:24.680 --> 05:28.840]  overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the
[05:28.840 --> 05:33.160]  problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every
[05:33.160 --> 05:36.880]  year thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages number
[05:36.880 --> 05:41.080]  five a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of
[05:41.080 --> 05:44.440]  mind folks I really believe in the solar power generators offered by solution

[08:06.680 --> 08:20.840]  information war continues it's Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[08:20.840 --> 08:27.480]  when people lose everything they lose it well that wasn't really the case during
[08:27.480 --> 08:32.440]  the decade-long engineered great depression upwards of 90% of the
[08:32.440 --> 08:38.400]  population I know I hammer this point home a lot was rural and was somewhat
[08:38.400 --> 08:42.240]  self-sufficient or completely self-sufficient they knew how to
[08:42.240 --> 08:46.680]  skin a buck run a trot line how to grow corn how to grow wheat how to grow
[08:46.680 --> 08:51.320]  vegetables in the backyard they knew how to hunt squirrels and white-tailed deer
[08:51.320 --> 08:57.680]  and elk they knew how to eat possums and let me tell you something where my
[08:57.680 --> 09:01.840]  family's from on my dad's side in East Texas all those old World War two vets
[09:01.840 --> 09:05.160]  that I went deer hunting with every year that hunted on our property they're all
[09:05.160 --> 09:09.480]  dead now great guys I actually think one of them still alive they would tell
[09:09.480 --> 09:13.400]  stories about the Great Depression and how there were almost no deer left no
[09:13.400 --> 09:18.160]  squirrels left no rabbits left hardly any quail or dove and people were hunting
[09:18.160 --> 09:24.600]  out a season 24 7 because that was their grocery store that was their grocery
[09:24.600 --> 09:29.200]  store people make fun of all those hillbillies they'll eat a possum they'll
[09:29.200 --> 09:34.600]  eat a raccoon they'll eat an armadilla well that's because they had food on the
[09:34.600 --> 09:40.240]  table every night major universities have estimated that seven million people
[09:40.240 --> 09:46.800]  died of starvation or from illnesses relating to their malnutrition during
[09:46.800 --> 09:52.600]  the decade-long Great Depression that's what 700,000 people or so every year
[09:52.600 --> 09:58.120]  dying of starvation related illnesses during that decade-long depression and
[09:58.120 --> 10:04.120]  that's with a population that 90% of them lived in rural areas now today the
[10:04.120 --> 10:09.720]  numbers are exactly reversed right at 90% are urban of the 10% that live in
[10:09.720 --> 10:20.280]  rural areas only half of them are self-sufficient 5% versus 90% of this
[10:20.280 --> 10:26.080]  country is self-sufficient I've got a couple years store of food I've talked
[10:26.080 --> 10:30.240]  about the radio if society collapses the government's gonna come confiscate
[10:30.240 --> 10:35.840]  that but at least I'm trying at least I try to have a garden the issue is the
[10:35.840 --> 10:40.800]  globalist have done this to Argentina to Brazil they've done it to hundreds and
[10:40.800 --> 10:45.080]  hundreds of other countries in Africa Asia Eastern Europe don't think for a
[10:45.080 --> 10:50.800]  minute they won't pull this on us to consolidate power and to train us how to
[10:50.800 --> 10:55.120]  submit to them now what did Gerald Salente say here yesterday he said this
[10:55.120 --> 10:59.880]  is gonna be the year of off with their heads and it's gonna be the year of when
[10:59.880 --> 11:07.960]  people lose everything they lose it now most of these videos and audio we're
[11:07.960 --> 11:12.160]  about to play had profanity we've cut most of it out there's a mild you know
[11:12.160 --> 11:16.240]  stuff but this is this is news this is happening and if you're watching it on
[11:16.240 --> 11:19.320]  you know prison money dot TV and don't want to see somebody getting shot and
[11:19.320 --> 11:23.560]  then turn away but they but you notice people don't get upset by all the
[11:23.560 --> 11:27.520]  violence on TV that simulated when they see real stuff it's upsetting and it
[11:27.520 --> 11:33.000]  should be upsetting but the issue here is there's a lot of different facets to
[11:33.000 --> 11:37.640]  this but you've got the school board lady coming up behind him with her bag
[11:37.640 --> 11:44.560]  hitting him in the back of the head first he goes up and sprays V for vendetta
[11:44.560 --> 11:49.840]  on the wall which is kind of a liberal style revolution movie mainly about I
[11:49.840 --> 11:54.960]  guess rebellion of gay people against oppression or whatever but and it's a
[11:54.960 --> 11:59.080]  surveillance state and the Wachowski brothers who made the matrix basically
[11:59.080 --> 12:03.800]  put it out so he sprays V for vendetta are they gonna call to ban the movie
[12:03.800 --> 12:09.400]  V for vendetta because the this guy was touched by it you see there's real
[12:09.400 --> 12:14.560]  tyranny going on real oppression but this poor guy wasn't given real avenues
[12:14.560 --> 12:19.360]  to take his country back he was a big fan of media matters and George Soros
[12:19.360 --> 12:24.800]  you know he's a liberal basically but you better believe the Southern
[12:24.800 --> 12:28.560]  Poverty Law Center the ADL right now have got his computer and if he ever
[12:28.560 --> 12:32.640]  visited info wars.com or prisonplanet.com they're gonna say it's my fault
[12:32.640 --> 12:36.920]  even though Paul Watson's gone to his websites and blogs and where the guy
[12:36.920 --> 12:43.040]  posted and he appears to be a liberal and I'm not saying liberals you know are
[12:43.040 --> 12:47.880]  inherently evil or they deserve to have their speech shut down it's just you
[12:47.880 --> 12:52.160]  know there's gonna be this angle this push and as there's more people going
[12:52.160 --> 12:56.920]  postal and his wife work for the government work for the school district
[12:56.920 --> 13:03.400]  and he'd been kicked off his government unemployment insurance and again I'm
[13:03.400 --> 13:06.480]  against socialism and dependency because it causes things like this where
[13:06.480 --> 13:11.520]  people don't know how to skin a buck or run a trot line but at least that
[13:11.520 --> 13:16.120]  stimulus money at least goes back to the people and they go out and buy things
[13:16.120 --> 13:21.720]  that's better than tens of trillions going offshore to shadowy banks so this
[13:21.720 --> 13:25.960]  is a very very sophisticated issue but then you've got the point of a woman
[13:25.960 --> 13:30.040]  charging in we see this so often old ladies are you know fighting off
[13:30.040 --> 13:34.400]  attackers with umbrellas or with their cane here comes the old lady looks like
[13:34.400 --> 13:40.680]  she's about 69 70 71 years old she comes up and hits him with a big old coach
[13:40.680 --> 13:46.440]  bag that probably felt like a pillow fight when you were eight years old and
[13:46.440 --> 13:49.080]  he just turns around and knocks her to the ground he looks like he weighs about
[13:49.080 --> 13:57.120]  350 pounds he's a big guy and if the issue is that woman should have had a
[13:57.120 --> 14:03.240]  revolver in her purse and she should have walked up and shot him in the back
[14:03.240 --> 14:11.600]  now I'm not a macho guy I'm not waving guns around but I do and I have on air
[14:11.600 --> 14:15.160]  showed people the fact that if somebody came in here and started shooting there
[14:15.160 --> 14:18.560]  are multiple people with concealed carries I don't have a concealed carry
[14:18.560 --> 14:24.800]  it's my office my operation I've got a 357 Magnum with seven shots in it right
[14:24.800 --> 14:29.040]  here sure I could have a gun with 40 rounds in it but I like the safety of a
[14:29.040 --> 14:33.920]  revolver that under stress it's easy to use doesn't you know jam compared to
[14:33.920 --> 14:38.280]  other type firearms I've got a reliable firearm right here and if somebody ever
[14:38.280 --> 14:41.520]  tries something like that I will just cold-bloodedly get up against the side
[14:41.520 --> 14:44.400]  of the wall wait for him to come along and I will shoot them in the back I
[14:44.400 --> 14:50.080]  won't macho stand out like a gun slinger I will maybe get on the floor and wait
[14:50.080 --> 14:55.160]  for him and I'm gonna shoot him you come to my house I'm gonna shoot you try to
[14:55.160 --> 15:00.400]  break in my house you're dead okay we and more guns less crime is the answer
[15:00.400 --> 15:05.400]  we're an armed society we've got a bunch of spoiled brats in this country who
[15:05.400 --> 15:09.320]  don't know how to take care of themselves and who are flipping out and
[15:09.320 --> 15:12.720]  who expect everything for free you saw what happened on Black Friday a few
[15:12.720 --> 15:18.040]  weeks ago with people stampeding each other going crazy fighting over you
[15:18.040 --> 15:24.560]  know discounts because there was no sales tax that day this country and and
[15:24.560 --> 15:29.760]  myself included to a certain extent it's all by degrees is extremely decadent
[15:29.760 --> 15:38.440]  and slovenly and it's a time bomb but the military's done actuaries and
[15:38.440 --> 15:42.880]  societal studies on it so has homeland security they know full well as things
[15:42.880 --> 15:47.960]  break down the police just like in Katrina or just like in the LA riots or
[15:47.960 --> 15:52.280]  any other big event they're gonna sit down the road the firemen who are the
[15:52.280 --> 15:57.440]  heroes are gonna come in and get shot at by the scum and then the police are
[15:57.440 --> 16:02.200]  gonna come and try to arrest Korean shopkeepers it doesn't matter who try to
[16:02.200 --> 16:05.760]  protect their property but a big crowd comes down the road wanting to burn down
[16:05.760 --> 16:08.680]  my neighborhood I'm gonna go out and shoot them all I mean it's real simple
[16:08.680 --> 16:12.280]  you start coming towards my family where my wife and kids are at with torches
[16:12.280 --> 16:15.080]  and you're setting stuff on fire I'm gonna get in a prone position with a
[16:15.080 --> 16:20.160]  tripod a 308 rifle with a backpack full of 30 round magazines and I'm gonna take
[16:20.160 --> 16:25.600]  you out you see that's the answer here I'm not looking for a fight but I'm
[16:25.600 --> 16:28.560]  here to tell people every one of those people on that school board should have
[16:28.560 --> 16:34.360]  a gun and not been victims okay and the minute that guy pulled a gun out and
[16:34.360 --> 16:39.680]  was pointing it at somebody else you just calmly reach up and calmly squeeze
[16:39.680 --> 16:46.360]  the trigger that's the secret just like you're shooting ducks in a barrel and so
[16:46.360 --> 16:50.840]  you shouldn't have to have a woman run up behind him heroically or as the
[16:50.840 --> 16:54.720]  heroine and hit the guy in the back of the head so there's that facet I want
[16:54.720 --> 16:58.080]  to go ahead and play the video of the woman and this is all up on prison

[24:29.560 --> 24:37.560]  a V on the wall, which is just his archetypal image of rebellion. If you would have sprayed
[24:37.560 --> 24:44.800]  a revolutionary war flag on the wall, would they have blamed America for it? No, these
[24:44.800 --> 24:52.720]  are angry, desperate people. And here's the article, when Americans lose everything, they
[24:52.720 --> 24:59.960]  start to lose it. Falling down, gunman opens fire on school board over economic woes, as
[24:59.960 --> 25:04.320]  Gerald Salindy is often warned, when Americans lose everything, they start to lose it. And
[25:04.320 --> 25:09.320]  nowhere was this more apparent than in the case of Clay Duke, a 56-year-old gunman, who
[25:09.320 --> 25:14.640]  opened fire on a school board members in protest against his wife being fired and his unemployment
[25:14.640 --> 25:19.160]  benefits running out. Duke spray painted V for vendetta sound on the wall before brandishing
[25:19.160 --> 25:24.720]  a gun and telling everyone apart from the school board members to leave the room. Watch
[25:24.720 --> 25:30.120]  what happened next in the video below. The response is to the tragic series of events
[25:30.120 --> 25:34.600]  from both the establishment left and the establishment right will undoubtedly be to try and portray
[25:34.600 --> 25:40.040]  Duke as a nutcase conspiracy theorist whose views are an example of why free speech on
[25:40.040 --> 25:44.280]  the Internet needs to be curtailed. Despite the fact that both on his Facebook page and
[25:44.280 --> 25:50.200]  another website he recommended Duke promoted websites from across the political spectrum
[25:50.200 --> 25:55.160]  including media matters who are usually the first to exploit tragic events like those
[25:55.160 --> 26:00.200]  to sling mud and their political adversaries. And I've called Watson up, he says he saw
[26:00.200 --> 26:04.160]  some of those, he's going to link to those and to some of the other scans and I've got
[26:04.160 --> 26:10.360]  some of the reported comments by this guy. It looks more like he was against the entire
[26:10.360 --> 26:14.240]  system like most Americans are. It's come out today, Congress has the lowest approval
[26:14.240 --> 26:19.840]  rating ever reported by Gallup poll. They want to divide us into Republicans and Democrats.
[26:19.840 --> 26:23.920]  Limbaugh divides us into Republicans, media matters and others into Democrats that have
[26:23.920 --> 26:28.320]  us fight with each other when it's the ruling class robbing the daylights out of us. And
[26:28.320 --> 26:32.600]  I want to point out I'm against violence but this guy was going after the wrong target.
[26:32.600 --> 26:38.120]  A school board? And I got to hand it to one of the school board members saying well I'm
[26:38.120 --> 26:43.520]  the one that did it, let the others go. I mean that's the way to do it. I mean just
[26:43.520 --> 26:49.680]  really good people. It appears. And that's what we're made up of in this country. We're
[26:49.680 --> 26:53.680]  just compartmentalized to where most people don't see the big picture of what's going
[26:53.680 --> 26:59.720]  on. It continues here, the fact that no one was injured and that Duke ultimately claimed
[26:59.720 --> 27:04.120]  his own life after he'd been shot, he shot himself, has contributed to him becoming a
[27:04.120 --> 27:10.040]  martyr in the Michael Douglas falling down mold. Yeah, shouldn't be a martyr. Rather
[27:10.040 --> 27:15.160]  than being considered a deranged lunatic. And Facebook pages in his honor are already
[27:15.160 --> 27:20.760]  attracting members. Duke was stopped when shots from a security guard named Mike Jones
[27:20.760 --> 27:25.780]  wounded him before he took his own life. Despite the fact that it was a gun that stopped the
[27:25.780 --> 27:31.520]  rampage, Time Magazine and others are already blaming the tragedy on the Second Amendment.
[27:31.520 --> 27:36.880]  No, it was a deranged mind. It was a Second Amendment that's stopping. In a de facto online
[27:36.880 --> 27:42.480]  suicide note posted on Facebook, Duke railed against the financial terrorist that prompted
[27:42.480 --> 27:49.160]  him to take such a drastic course of action. I was just born. I was just born poor in a
[27:49.160 --> 27:55.040]  country where the wealthy manipulate use abuse and economically enslave 90% of the population.
[27:55.040 --> 28:03.000]  Rich Republicans, rich Democrats, same, same rich, they take turns fleecing us. No, there's
[28:03.000 --> 28:08.160]  a tiny banking elite that's very corrupt. And the military industrial complex that
[28:08.160 --> 28:12.240]  manipulate the society. It's not the guy down the street that owns a restaurant buddy that's
[28:12.240 --> 28:17.920]  your enemy. Rich Republicans, rich Democrats, same, same rich, they take turns fleecing
[28:17.920 --> 28:24.080]  us are few dollars, pyramiding the wealth for themselves. He wrote the 95% of the US
[28:24.080 --> 28:32.200]  of a are neo slaves of the global south. See, that's kind of a liberal thing there. Our
[28:32.200 --> 28:39.120]  masters, the wealthy do as they like to us. And it just goes on from there. This goes
[28:39.120 --> 28:44.880]  far deeper than someone violently acting upon political grievances. Duke's actions were
[28:44.880 --> 28:50.200]  solely guided by his economic woes. The fact that his wife had lost her job, that the unemployment
[28:50.200 --> 28:55.000]  benefits had run out and that the future offered no hope whatsoever. No, he'd be homeless.
[28:55.000 --> 28:58.400]  This is a future that millions more Americans will have to face in the coming years is the
[28:58.400 --> 29:04.960]  unemployment rate, which is really around 20% level continues to accelerate. As we warn
[29:04.960 --> 29:09.800]  back in June, we are in the early stages of a new age of rage, wrote an article about
[29:09.800 --> 29:13.560]  it, which will be characterized by riots, revolutions and widespread backlash against
[29:13.560 --> 29:17.120]  the economic Holocaust that has been unleashed by the global elite by design. Unfortunately,
[29:17.120 --> 29:21.760]  there will be many more clay dougs over the coming years. There will be more Americans
[29:21.760 --> 29:28.120]  who lose everything and decide that the best way is to simply lose it all together. Well
[29:28.120 --> 29:33.080]  done Watson on that article. But we're again, I mean, it's clear I've got more quotes here
[29:33.080 --> 29:38.520]  from him. He quotes Warren Buffett, who was a few weeks ago on this week on ABC, shaking
[29:38.520 --> 29:42.760]  people on the rich saying, you know, tax every year, you know, tax people making 100,000
[29:42.760 --> 29:47.160]  a year saying they're the rich, because he's at the very top of the pyramid abuses government
[29:47.160 --> 29:51.840]  to transfer your wealth. We're going to come back with more of his quotes. We're on the
[29:51.840 --> 30:03.920]  march. The empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN radio network. Hi, this is Alex

[32:00.600 --> 32:05.240]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[32:05.240 --> 32:09.600]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[32:09.600 --> 32:13.920]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company
[32:13.920 --> 32:19.000]  allows you to have. It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart
[32:19.000 --> 32:23.640]  grid technology is coming. Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid
[32:23.640 --> 32:29.280]  is dangerously overloaded. And now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[32:29.280 --> 32:33.600]  Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids. Every year, thousands
[32:33.600 --> 32:38.280]  of families lose their power from weather-related onages. Number five, a solar power generator
[32:38.280 --> 32:42.480]  provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind. Folks, I really believe in the solar
[32:42.480 --> 32:46.560]  power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors. You can

[33:01.360 --> 33:21.040]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[33:21.040 --> 33:28.080]  By the way, Paul Watson is beefing up, adding more intel to his article, when Americans lose
[33:28.080 --> 33:34.840]  everything, they start to lose it. We've confirmed on his Facebook and other sites that his favorite
[33:34.840 --> 33:47.240]  websites were Media Matters and other mainstream news, but also We Are Change, which of course
[33:47.240 --> 33:52.800]  I helped spawn with Luke Radowski that is all about be the change you want to see in
[33:52.800 --> 33:59.120]  the world nonviolent and on the front page, there's a giant image of Mahatma Gandhi and
[33:59.120 --> 34:07.080]  Martin Luther King. Media Matters has been so wicked towards us and tried to claim that
[34:07.080 --> 34:14.120]  we're calling for violence that they'll probably just excise out We Are Change and won't even
[34:14.120 --> 34:25.840]  care and just ignore that they're listed as well. Just outrageous. Very, very outrageous.
[34:25.840 --> 34:36.400]  Clearly, this was a freaked out, upset guy who was just at the end of his road. I would
[34:36.400 --> 34:41.160]  explain this psychological profile for you right now because I discovered this doing
[34:41.160 --> 34:48.680]  research over the last 15 years. There was a 2020 special about it in 1991, within one
[34:48.680 --> 34:55.800]  year in 1989, of public schools, including Littleton, Colorado, implementing what is
[34:55.800 --> 35:02.800]  called death education and suicide prevention. They teach the kids how you die, you get in
[35:02.800 --> 35:09.560]  a simulated coffin. It's very bizarre. It's mind control. It's meant to make them depressed
[35:09.560 --> 35:13.200]  and that's come out with the big drug makers. They actually put this in in the name of making
[35:13.200 --> 35:18.200]  kids not commit suicide, but they know then that it introduces to the children the idea
[35:18.200 --> 35:24.200]  of committing suicide. They've had just countless cases where particularly 11, 12, 13-year-old
[35:24.200 --> 35:30.600]  girls will hear about this and they'll teach them, oh, did you know little girls hang themselves
[35:30.600 --> 35:35.680]  with shoelaces or belts and they'll go into the public school bathroom and hang themselves
[35:35.680 --> 35:45.840]  on the coat hanger point that's on the inside of the stall and you can search this and pull
[35:45.840 --> 35:51.400]  it up. School districts nationwide, the last five, six years, have pulled out the coat
[35:51.400 --> 35:59.560]  hanger areas inside the stalls because people were killing themselves, mainly little girls.
[35:59.560 --> 36:03.320]  Then once the little girls say they're depressed because it's been introduced to them that
[36:03.320 --> 36:07.680]  they should be depressed, that it's a big drama queen thing, then it's trendy for mommy
[36:07.680 --> 36:12.560]  and daddy to put them on Prozac or one of those other variants of serotonin reuptake
[36:12.560 --> 36:19.680]  inhibitors. Then, but it's trendy to put little Johnny on the amphetamine class drugs like
[36:19.680 --> 36:26.240]  of course Ritalin, Adderall and others that cause the heart to swell, the brain to shrink,
[36:26.240 --> 36:31.200]  they retard growth, they cause brain damage and parents just sadly go, well, the school
[36:31.200 --> 36:36.240]  said so and boy, my daughter or son's a lot better now, yeah, because they're burnout.
[36:36.240 --> 36:41.420]  You were giving them coke, you were giving them sweets, they were having sugar crashes,
[36:41.420 --> 36:46.560]  they had bad nutrition and so you just burned their brain out. I'm sorry if you don't want
[36:46.560 --> 36:50.720]  to hear this, this is a fact. I've talked to medical doctors, nutritionists, you name
[36:50.720 --> 36:55.720]  it. They've done major studies where getting real nutrition and not drinking fluoridated
[36:55.720 --> 37:01.960]  water and not drinking processed sugar drinks that are inventing machines all over the schools
[37:01.960 --> 37:06.280]  or chocolate milk like we had in school. I remember always like an hour after lunch,
[37:06.280 --> 37:12.480]  I got a headache and feel groggy because I was going to eat pizzas, two chocolate milks.
[37:12.480 --> 37:17.520]  I like salads so I'd go ahead and eat a salad too, but boy, I love that school food. The
[37:17.520 --> 37:23.520]  mashed potatoes, the chicken fried steaks, I was in there getting double helpings. It's
[37:23.520 --> 37:30.560]  unhealthy, but again, I'm trying to cover the whole spectrum of this. They introduced
[37:30.560 --> 37:36.200]  the idea of how to commit suicide. So now since they introduced death education in the
[37:36.200 --> 37:42.520]  late 80s and it's gone nationwide since then, you look at the charts for teenage suicide,
[37:42.520 --> 37:47.200]  it's just going straight up and it's the same thing with the media advertising and
[37:47.200 --> 37:53.960]  hyping people going postal in the 80s. It was always military veterans in almost every
[37:53.960 --> 38:02.320]  case who had lost their, their governors to not want to shoot and kill people. Most of
[38:02.320 --> 38:06.640]  them had been in combat, they'd shot and killed people. That's how they deal with stress.
[38:06.640 --> 38:10.920]  They've been trained to be killers. I'm not saying they're bad people. And then they go
[38:10.920 --> 38:17.400]  in to work at the government building, mainly the post office. It's a stressful job. They
[38:17.400 --> 38:23.160]  got some boss bossing them around, make some angry. They don't go commit suicide or they
[38:23.160 --> 38:26.840]  don't go sell their house and you know, go moving with family or go, you know, travel
[38:26.840 --> 38:31.760]  the country or whatever as they should just enjoy life. Even if they become homeless,
[38:31.760 --> 38:39.360]  they go in and they shoot their boss and they shoot a couple other coworkers. The media
[38:39.360 --> 38:45.480]  hypes it up. They play it up. They constantly put that idea out there. They have all these
[38:45.480 --> 38:52.800]  drills for mass shooters all over the place. Introducing the idea and then it begins to
[38:52.800 --> 38:58.440]  happen. So there's also that facet to all of this, but I wanted to get in to some more
[38:58.440 --> 39:07.160]  of the points that I made dealing with this. When Americans lose everything, they start
[39:07.160 --> 39:12.040]  to lose it. And I wrote some notes here. Number one, Mike Jones, the security guard did his
[39:12.040 --> 39:18.640]  job. He's a hero. He went in there, fired one time and shot Mr. Duke. Mr. Duke fell
[39:18.640 --> 39:22.400]  to the ground, realized what was happening, that he was about to go to prison for life
[39:22.400 --> 39:30.800]  and killed himself, showing what a desperate person he was. We don't know if Duke again
[39:30.800 --> 39:35.160]  didn't want to kill people and so was aiming above them or beside them, which is common
[39:35.160 --> 39:39.680]  if you're not a trained killer who's been trained to instinctively kill and not think
[39:39.680 --> 39:45.040]  like the police are with instinctive shooting and the military. We have the whole issue
[39:45.040 --> 39:49.600]  of the second amendment stopped this guy and I've made the point. You come in my house,
[39:49.600 --> 39:56.280]  my business, my car, there was some nuts shooting people next door. I'd go out there and deal
[39:56.280 --> 40:03.360]  with them because that's how we respond to this. You don't respond by disarming or trying
[40:03.360 --> 40:07.680]  to disarm people because a nut's always going to be able to get a gun. A nut could walk
[40:07.680 --> 40:11.360]  up and hit a cop on the head with a baseball bat and take their gun away from them. Then
[40:11.360 --> 40:16.600]  the Nanny State's answer is RFID and all the guns. And then they want to ban steak knives
[40:16.600 --> 40:21.760]  in England because people are stabbing people. No, it's the human mind that's the issue.
[40:21.760 --> 40:26.680]  Not the car that can be used as a weapon or the aeroplane. It's the human mind. It's
[40:26.680 --> 40:33.680]  the individual. Again, I make the point that I'm totally against what happened here. This
[40:33.680 --> 40:38.160]  is horrible. They will use this to clamp down on everybody. This is not the response we
[40:38.160 --> 40:43.360]  need. But if he's going to go after the government, why the school board? Well, they fired his
[40:43.360 --> 40:52.080]  wife. They're laying people off for whatever reason. So that's why he went there. But if
[40:52.080 --> 41:00.520]  he's writing in his Facebook blogs and other places, my testament, some people, the government
[41:00.520 --> 41:07.560]  sponsored media, which it is, will say, I was an evil monster. No, I was just born
[41:07.560 --> 41:13.520]  poor in a country where the wealthy manipulate, use abuse and economically enslave 95% of
[41:13.520 --> 41:20.640]  the population. Rich Republicans, rich Democrats, same, same, rich. They take turns fleecing
[41:20.640 --> 41:27.480]  us our few dollars, pyramiding the wealth for themselves. 95% of us in the US of A are
[41:27.480 --> 41:33.760]  the neo slaves of the global south, our masters, the wealthy do as they like to us. And then
[41:33.760 --> 41:39.720]  he quotes Warren Buffett, who skillfully plays class warfare, the very top of the pyramid,
[41:39.720 --> 41:44.720]  a guy worth hundreds of billions of dollars. He claims it's 40 something billion. He puts
[41:44.720 --> 41:51.120]  his billions in attacks free operations and tells you it's philanthropy, something the
[41:51.120 --> 42:02.240]  Rockefellers invented philanthropy is not charity, totally different. And it continues.
[42:02.240 --> 42:07.040]  There's class warfare. All right, but it's my class, the rich class that's making war
[42:07.040 --> 42:13.360]  and we're winning Warren Buffett. So he quotes Warren Buffett. He goes on rise like lions
[42:13.360 --> 42:22.920]  after slumber in unvanquishable number, shake your change to earth like do, which in sleep
[42:22.920 --> 42:29.940]  has fallen on you. Ye are many, they are few. So V for Vendetta, the image of people marching
[42:29.940 --> 42:36.460]  in mass past the corrupt military and taking down the bankers who were surveilling everyone
[42:36.460 --> 42:42.480]  and propagandizing and the government's running the dominant media. It's the corruption that
[42:42.480 --> 42:46.840]  makes V for Vendetta so powerful because it's telling a true story about oppression on so
[42:46.840 --> 42:51.520]  many levels. It is the bank stealing trillions and robbing the nation and they haven't even
[42:51.520 --> 42:56.240]  gotten done. We're a year or two behind Ireland and Greece and others. It's just now getting
[42:56.240 --> 43:01.920]  ready to come here. Crime is exploding. I mean, I've got stacks of news here where it's
[43:01.920 --> 43:07.600]  just expanding police departments and sheriff's departments are laying off in some cases, 60
[43:07.600 --> 43:15.680]  percent of their deputies are police and announcing they're only going to respond. They're only
[43:15.680 --> 43:25.040]  going to respond to things like shootings and that they're the rest of the time going
[43:25.040 --> 43:31.360]  to be out there engaged in revenue generation. Well, I discovered that 15 years ago, my car
[43:31.360 --> 43:37.640]  got stolen in Dallas. I discovered that. I had a girlfriend up there as I grew up in
[43:37.640 --> 43:42.520]  Dallas and I had a old sweetheart I used to go visit and then my car got stolen a second
[43:42.520 --> 43:47.280]  time and she lived in a middle class area and wasn't even that nice of a car. Stolen
[43:47.280 --> 43:51.840]  twice. Cops wouldn't come. Second time, I guess it happened like 16 years ago then about
[43:51.840 --> 43:57.840]  a year later, 15 years ago, maybe 17 years ago and then 16 years ago. Yeah, I don't
[43:57.840 --> 44:04.600]  really got a show yet. The point is I'm up in Dallas visiting with her and they steal
[44:04.600 --> 44:10.160]  my car twice. And the second time the police said, well, we're not going to help you and
[44:10.160 --> 44:15.440]  it might show up at an impound yard. And I said, okay, and hung up. Cops show up, arrogantly
[44:15.440 --> 44:20.280]  force their way into the apartment, looking around for drugs or whatever and tell me you
[44:20.280 --> 44:28.440]  don't hang up on 9 11. Okay. On 9 11, you don't hang up. So it's the old joke of like
[44:28.440 --> 44:31.440]  a third world country. Don't call the police for something because they'll end up just
[44:31.440 --> 44:36.560]  shaking you down. We're becoming a third world country. Take the Dallas police. They got
[44:36.560 --> 44:40.800]  caught what five years ago, framing thousands of people. They just randomly pull over a
[44:40.800 --> 44:47.440]  nice car, throw a bag of cocaine in the back on record. Then they got lazy because it was
[44:47.440 --> 44:50.880]  hard to get cocaine out of the evidence locker. They just throw a chalk in the back of your
[44:50.880 --> 44:55.200]  car. They took sheetrock and busted it up and they just take your car, go take your
[44:55.200 --> 45:03.000]  house. And you know, I was listening to the news yesterday in Austin and a cop ran a red
[45:03.000 --> 45:07.880]  light, excuse me, a stop sign and hit a guy on a motorcycle. And the police was saying,
[45:07.880 --> 45:12.520]  well, motorcycles aren't safe. It's your fault. You lost your leg. And the callers
[45:12.520 --> 45:17.200]  were calling into 590 and Jeff Ward, the local host was blown away going, you guys are defending
[45:17.200 --> 45:22.120]  the police. They're like, yes, it's, you know, police can do no wrong. It's like a mental
[45:22.120 --> 45:27.280]  illness or something. When you start saying police can do no wrong, that allows the criminals
[45:27.280 --> 45:34.000]  to take it over. They've turned this government worship into a religion. So the government
[45:34.000 --> 45:38.600]  is completely out of control and they're getting ready to start laying off most of the state
[45:38.600 --> 45:43.560]  and local government people and they're going to be going postal. And then the government's
[45:43.560 --> 45:47.440]  going to go in and you know, it turned out Richard Poplowski who shot and killed three
[45:47.440 --> 45:53.440]  cops in Pittsburgh a year and a half ago. He was a Fox News fan. CNN visited that, visited
[45:53.440 --> 45:58.520]  Glenn Beck was, was really a Nazi, visited all the big Nazi sites and posted how much
[45:58.520 --> 46:05.560]  he loved them, posted on those sites and my sites, how much he hated me. Within two hours
[46:05.560 --> 46:10.720]  of him being arrested after killing three cops at his house, his mommy's house and the Marines
[46:10.720 --> 46:14.080]  trained him how to kill by the way. I'm not blaming them. That's just, you know, you want
[46:14.080 --> 46:17.720]  to point the finger. That's the instinct of killing. He thought it was a video game.
[46:17.720 --> 46:22.200]  You know, Pop goes to the weasel three times in a row, three men he killed in cold blood.
[46:22.200 --> 46:26.200]  He responded to his mommy calling to throw him out because his pit bulls were defecating
[46:26.200 --> 46:33.400]  all over the floor. Spoiled brat. Within two hours of him in custody, headline, Alex Jones
[46:33.400 --> 46:38.480]  told him to do it. Alex Jones and I made five newspapers retract and then we got his
[46:38.480 --> 46:43.960]  quotes. He was a white supremacist who hated me. Doesn't matter to the Southern Private
[46:43.960 --> 46:49.120]  Law Center and ADL controlled newspapers in that city. They got into those computers.
[46:49.120 --> 46:54.400]  They found he visited my websites and it was my fault and they're going to continue to
[46:54.400 --> 47:00.760]  do that. They're going to continue. They're not going to stop. Now this guy recommended
[47:00.760 --> 47:08.760]  his favorite websites. Media matters along with we are change and, you know, and, and,
[47:08.760 --> 47:11.840]  and Veefer Vendetta. It's not media matters fault. It's not we are change fault. It's
[47:11.840 --> 47:18.560]  not Veefer Vendetta's fault. It's the fault of this overall out of control culture that
[47:18.560 --> 47:23.720]  he was domesticated that he didn't have strong family that he didn't have people to stick
[47:23.720 --> 47:29.040]  together with. But that wasn't his fault. That's a nature of this advanced civilization
[47:29.040 --> 47:34.760]  that it's turned us basically into like domesticated animals that don't even know how to forage
[47:34.760 --> 47:42.720]  for ourselves. Now there's some other facets to all of this too that I want to hit on.
[47:42.720 --> 47:51.560]  But at the end of the day, the largest point I want to make is that we're sitting on top
[47:51.560 --> 47:56.960]  of a powder keg and the system 11 years ago when they got rid of Glass-Steagall and allowed
[47:56.960 --> 48:02.640]  the trillions of derivatives to be created that are impossible to pay back on record.
[48:02.640 --> 48:06.680]  The Rand Corporation read the reports on there at the time. They were even in the news is
[48:06.680 --> 48:10.400]  how I learned about it saying we're going to our society is going to change. Tribes are
[48:10.400 --> 48:15.560]  going to be on the street. Our new economy is going to be surveillance. And we're going
[48:15.560 --> 48:21.760]  to have one child policies and America is going to implode. And because of economic degradation,
[48:21.760 --> 48:29.000]  we're going to have a totally authoritarian society. And now the middle class as crime
[48:29.000 --> 48:34.960]  explodes, as the shootings explode, as the problems expand, as people get desperate,
[48:34.960 --> 48:39.560]  they're going to offer homeland security and the threat fusion centers. And if you see
[48:39.560 --> 48:43.400]  something say something that's designed to make you not trust your neighbors even more,
[48:43.400 --> 48:47.440]  we should all be coming together to help each other. We should all be coming together to
[48:47.440 --> 48:51.600]  also politically get together. And instead of going and shooting a cop down the street,
[48:51.600 --> 48:56.460]  or shooting somebody at a school board meeting, no, we should be getting together with grand
[48:56.460 --> 49:00.960]  juries and taking back our legislatures and kicking out the electronic voting machines
[49:00.960 --> 49:07.120]  and taking Congress back. Congress now has the lowest approval rating in its history.
[49:07.120 --> 49:12.440]  We should be doing that. We should be taking our system back and pointing out it's the
[49:12.440 --> 49:17.600]  mega central banks that have created a debt black hole and fostered and financed carbon
[49:17.600 --> 49:22.760]  tax moves to fund themselves and shut down the real economy, who have financed all the
[49:22.760 --> 49:28.280]  federalization moves worldwide so they can centralize control. This is the system that
[49:28.280 --> 49:33.360]  we're facing and dealing with. And it's us or them. It's in the IMF World Bank documents
[49:33.360 --> 49:37.800]  that got leaked in 2002. It's in the last chapter in my out of print book. It's online
[49:37.800 --> 49:47.840]  at prismplanet.tv. And what is it saying there? Joseph Sticklet's left the World Bank. Suddenly
[49:47.840 --> 49:52.680]  these documents get released. I interviewed Greg Palast. We cover the documents the BBC
[49:52.680 --> 49:58.320]  got. And they said, in Argentina, in other nations, we implode the economy. We get the
[49:58.320 --> 50:03.600]  countries in a derivative debt. We blow it out. Then people start rioting. That further
[50:03.600 --> 50:11.680]  destroys confidence. Then we bring in the military. Then we have a basic dictatorship. And the
[50:11.680 --> 50:18.400]  middle class will quote side with the elite because that's how they set it up. And then
[50:18.400 --> 50:23.480]  the middle class themselves are destroyed. This is why Latin America is poor. This is
[50:23.480 --> 50:29.320]  why Africa is poor. This is why Eastern Europe is poor because they succumb to this. And
[50:29.320 --> 50:37.120]  now it's happening to us. And we're going into this headlong right now. And the system
[50:37.120 --> 50:41.640]  in the Ministry of Defense report three years ago in England, the government Pentagon reports
[50:41.640 --> 50:46.080]  the last two years, they go like, oh jeepers, there's going to be societal collapse. We
[50:46.080 --> 50:50.720]  better set up a martial law control system to counter it. But they openly at the top
[50:50.720 --> 50:55.600]  work for the very bankers and the social engineers who played all this out. And I've been telling
[50:55.600 --> 51:00.240]  you for over a decade exactly what was coming. And now we're going into it headlong. But
[51:00.240 --> 51:04.440]  knowing we can. This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a
[51:04.440 --> 51:09.320]  solar power generator. Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your
[51:09.320 --> 51:14.400]  electric bill. Number two, our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric
[51:14.400 --> 51:19.280]  company allows you to have. It's true. Total government control of electricity in the name
[51:19.280 --> 51:24.160]  of smart grid technology is coming. Number three, in some areas of the country, the power
[51:24.160 --> 51:29.200]  grid is dangerously overloaded. And now new socialist legislation is only compounding
[51:29.200 --> 51:33.880]  the problem. Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids. Every year
[51:33.880 --> 51:38.280]  thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages. Number five, a solar
[51:38.280 --> 51:42.880]  power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind. Folks, I really believe
[51:42.880 --> 51:47.200]  in the solar power generators offered by solution from science. One of my oldest sponsors.

[52:01.040 --> 52:06.600]  A very wealthy US citizen is predicting that in 2011 we will witness the most important
[52:06.600 --> 52:11.880]  day in America in more than 50 years. He says it will change everything about our lives.
[52:11.880 --> 52:15.840]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children and even how you take care of your
[52:15.840 --> 52:20.200]  health and your own family. Now this man has made some outrageous predictions of the years.
[52:20.200 --> 52:25.080]  The crazy part is, he's usually right. You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Panny
[52:25.080 --> 52:29.520]  May, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties. In fact,
[52:29.520 --> 52:34.080]  Barron's called his work a dire prophecy. Recently, he created a video which you can
[52:34.080 --> 52:38.240]  watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet, and it's
[52:38.240 --> 52:42.760]  a real eye-opener. I can't stress this enough. You should at least watch this free video
[52:42.760 --> 52:46.840]  online today. He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take
[52:46.840 --> 52:53.600]  to protect yourself. You can find the video at www.endofamerica3.com. That's End of America.

[54:08.520 --> 54:27.480]  Okay, you know about a month ago Lindsey Williams revealed who Mr. X was, former head of operations
[54:27.480 --> 54:35.600]  for Atlantic Richfield. He has unfortunately died of the cancer and he's going to be joining
[54:35.600 --> 54:44.320]  us coming up in about 35 minutes. I don't want to get too much into this, but we have
[54:44.320 --> 54:55.080]  a white hat hacker who goes by Winston Smith of federaljack.com. He's associated with that
[54:55.080 --> 55:00.920]  great We Are Change type spinoff down in Florida, also expanding across the country. They do
[55:00.920 --> 55:07.840]  great work and he's an amazing hacker and I'm just going to leave it at that. I mean
[55:07.840 --> 55:13.160]  he has sat there in real time and shut down major websites right in front of me. Like watch,
[55:13.160 --> 55:20.680]  I'll turn this major website off for two minutes now and just turn it off. Okay, I'll just
[55:20.680 --> 55:30.720]  leave it at that. I probably shouldn't even look. The issue here is that he concurs with
[55:30.720 --> 55:40.120]  my analysis of what's going on with Anonymous and the attacks on WikiLeaks and that it is
[55:40.120 --> 55:45.120]  a government infiltration operation as they are on the major hacking sites trying to recruit
[55:45.120 --> 55:53.280]  people to attack news outlets, credit card companies as the pretext to bring in the homeland
[55:53.280 --> 56:00.200]  security takeover of the Internet which they're openly announcing and this just came in. When
[56:00.200 --> 56:05.800]  I was in England five years ago, I was there three days before they banned protesting within
[56:05.800 --> 56:10.400]  several miles of parliament and the cops came over and said, well, it's going to be banned
[56:10.400 --> 56:14.760]  later in the week. They've passed the law but it isn't in effect yet. But go ahead and
[56:14.760 --> 56:18.040]  turn your bullhorn off and get out of here. We don't care of it in the law. We're going
[56:18.040 --> 56:29.440]  to arrest you and that's in Terror Storm but police mole banning all UK protest. Oh, see,
[56:29.440 --> 56:34.040]  I remember it came out a few years ago that the entire parliament is spied on by MI5 and
[56:34.040 --> 56:39.400]  MI6. The parliament is supposedly the government but you've got the intelligence agencies,
[56:39.400 --> 56:46.120]  you've got the security services. I mean, England is becoming like Venezuela. They announced
[56:46.120 --> 56:51.680]  today that Hugo Chavez is going to rule by decree. What does Obama do? They pass health
[56:51.680 --> 56:57.680]  care and then he rules by decree and says these 500 plus major businesses are exempt
[56:57.680 --> 57:03.560]  but everybody else has got to pay it. That goes on long. They'll only be government approved
[57:03.560 --> 57:10.560]  corporations. That's how royalty always operated. You had to have the seal as an approved operation
[57:10.560 --> 57:19.920]  to have a shipping company or to brew beer or to grow wheat. This is a planned economy.
[57:19.920 --> 57:24.160]  This is what they admit they're building and look at this article. This is how to press
[57:24.160 --> 57:31.240]  TV. Police mole banning all UK protest. The British police chief says he's weighing up
[57:31.240 --> 57:36.520]  an option to ask the Home Secretary to enforce a ban on any future protest gatherings altogether
[57:36.520 --> 57:45.600]  across the UK. See, as I said five years ago, it's the parliament area today, all of England
[57:45.600 --> 57:52.400]  tomorrow, the world next week. Tens of thousands of student protestors from universities, colleges
[57:52.400 --> 57:57.200]  and schools have been marching across England. What comes next? You're going to go to a relocation
[57:57.200 --> 58:05.520]  camp if you protest? Oh, yeah. What did Kennedy say? Those that make peaceful protesting impossible
[58:05.520 --> 58:10.720]  make violent revolution inevitable? Tens of thousands of student protests from university
[58:10.720 --> 58:14.840]  colleges and schools have been marching across England and protesting against the huge hikes
[58:14.840 --> 58:20.120]  and tuition fees together with the scraping and scrapping of educational maintenance allowance
[58:20.120 --> 58:27.000]  and proposed cuts in college funding. Police have arrested 180. And it goes on. The motion
[58:27.000 --> 58:32.680]  was voted on and approved last Thursday. And it goes on. Metropolitan to police commissioner
[58:32.680 --> 58:37.520]  said banning students from marching was a power he had not ruled out using. We're going
[58:37.520 --> 58:43.320]  to read you his quote. This is in mainstream British newspapers as well. Thank you for
[58:43.320 --> 58:54.120]  listening to GCN. Visit GCN Live.com today. You've heard Alex explain how the Silver Lungs
[58:54.120 --> 58:59.440]  Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self produced colloidal silver solutions.
[58:59.440 --> 59:02.800]  Yet many are unaware of the entire function of the Silver Lungs System and how it has
[59:02.800 --> 59:08.280]  been designed to deliver your silver solutions anywhere in or on the body. My name is Mario
[59:08.280 --> 59:13.120]  Sifaldi and I'm the developer of the Silver Lungs Generator. Not only does the Silver
[59:13.120 --> 59:17.880]  Lungs System produce endless colloidal and ionic silver solutions, it also comes equipped
[59:17.880 --> 59:22.680]  with the proper applicators and devices needed to deliver your silver solutions directly
[59:22.680 --> 59:30.720]  to key target areas. This includes the eyes, ears, nose, lungs, topically to the skin and
[59:30.720 --> 59:35.240]  orally for the digestive system. Be sure to watch our new seven minute video tour of the
[59:35.240 --> 59:42.240]  Silver Lungs System at www.silverlungs.com to learn more about how the Silver Lungs System
[59:42.240 --> 1:00:06.240]  works. As well, we are always ready to answer any questions you may have. That's www.silverlungs.com.
[1:00:06.240 --> 1:00:33.840]  We've got an amazing White Hat Hacker, those by Winston Smith from federaljack.com. He
[1:00:33.840 --> 1:00:43.440]  just likes federaljack. So that's his handle. His handle today. But I don't want to imply
[1:00:43.440 --> 1:00:48.600]  he did something wrong. We authorized him to run attacks against our sides to show us
[1:00:48.600 --> 1:00:54.920]  all the problems and vulnerabilities. It's just amazing. And I know some people that
[1:00:54.920 --> 1:01:00.080]  know him. He's really a security consultant. But you could call him a hacker, a White Hat
[1:01:00.080 --> 1:01:07.200]  Hacker. And he concurs with my analysis. And the government is out there openly recruiting
[1:01:07.200 --> 1:01:13.720]  on the hacker sides to try to attack Patriot groups and organizations, obviously yours
[1:01:13.720 --> 1:01:20.480]  truly. And they've, you know, the issue is that this is an attack against free speech.
[1:01:20.480 --> 1:01:24.680]  And the whole WikiLeaks thing is very complex, but I'm going to break it down coming up in
[1:01:24.680 --> 1:01:29.840]  the next segment. And then Lindsay Williams can now give you the full name. It's been
[1:01:29.840 --> 1:01:33.440]  hidden in plain view. We already gave it out a month ago with him. Mr. Rex unfortunately
[1:01:33.440 --> 1:01:38.000]  has died. And now Williams can tell you everything because some of it he wasn't authorized to
[1:01:38.000 --> 1:01:44.600]  say until the former head of operations for Atlantic Richfield died. He has another individual
[1:01:44.600 --> 1:01:50.080]  which are both in his book from 20 something years ago. This is all hidden in plain view
[1:01:50.080 --> 1:01:57.360]  who is now giving him even more intel who was the actual CEO of one of the big three.
[1:01:57.360 --> 1:02:02.480]  Here's another police state article, one million approved for ID scanners and childcare facilities.
[1:02:02.480 --> 1:02:08.120]  Devices intended to cut down on fraud in Wisconsin. Shares pro see everywhere. Wanted suntan,
[1:02:08.120 --> 1:02:16.600]  want to buy groceries, want to get some beer, got a thumbprint. It's just going in everywhere.
[1:02:16.600 --> 1:02:21.720]  The total cashless society is going into place right now. And I was just reading this earlier
[1:02:21.720 --> 1:02:26.120]  and it integrates in with these announcements of the Obama kill switch, the federal government
[1:02:26.120 --> 1:02:32.240]  kill switch. People love to call Obama this Obama that when Obama's gone and Sarah Palin's
[1:02:32.240 --> 1:02:39.040]  in there or Rick Perry, Republicans are going to love the kill switch. The main line Republicans.
[1:02:39.040 --> 1:02:44.640]  It's just like they're like execute Julie and Assange. They're like we don't understand.
[1:02:44.640 --> 1:02:50.440]  You say it's George Soros connected. But then you say don't kill Assange. They got a grand
[1:02:50.440 --> 1:02:55.240]  jury in Virginia that's getting ready to indict him. That's mainstream news for high treason.
[1:02:55.240 --> 1:03:00.680]  He's not an American citizen. He's a journalist. You can't indict him. I mean, can the communist
[1:03:00.680 --> 1:03:07.080]  Chinese indict the Pope for treason and ship him to Beijing to be beheaded? Can they, can
[1:03:07.080 --> 1:03:14.160]  they indict Colonel Sanders? Can they indict Jaren Neihart out there or Phil? Can they
[1:03:14.160 --> 1:03:27.200]  indict Magic Johnson? Can they indict? Who's a famous golfer? Tiger Woods. I mean, can
[1:03:27.200 --> 1:03:32.360]  they just oh, we indict you now extradite. This is global government, which the UN's
[1:03:32.360 --> 1:03:36.480]  announced Ruth Bader Ginsburg years ago in USA today said, Oh, yeah, we're going to have
[1:03:36.480 --> 1:03:43.600]  global government. We're foreign governments extradite you for treason. So now, I mean,
[1:03:43.600 --> 1:03:50.640]  will Libya extradite me? Because I think Muammar Gaddafi's thuggish. If I criticize Hugo
[1:03:50.640 --> 1:03:59.280]  Chavez, will I be extradited? I mean, this is all happening. This is all going on right
[1:03:59.280 --> 1:04:06.200]  now. And you've got to decide, you know, is the truth treason? But here's a quote by
[1:04:06.200 --> 1:04:13.240]  Sir Paul Stevenson. Oh, Sir Paul, the Metropolitan Police Commissioner. It's one of the tactics
[1:04:13.240 --> 1:04:17.160]  we will look at and something we will keep under review. And if we think it's the right
[1:04:17.160 --> 1:04:24.800]  thing to do, we will do it, said Sir Paul Stevenson. Do you know? Do you know what it
[1:04:24.800 --> 1:04:28.360]  is when the government says no protesting period? I mean, first they put us in free
[1:04:28.360 --> 1:04:35.600]  speech zones and that's that's a form of martial law. But now the real fangs are being extended.
[1:04:35.600 --> 1:04:40.340]  The gloves are coming off. Oh, yeah, we're now looking at just banning protest period
[1:04:40.340 --> 1:04:45.400]  nationwide. But get me Watson or Steve Watson on the air. They're over in England. They
[1:04:45.400 --> 1:04:50.560]  need to write this. It needs to be martial law being considered in the UK. I mean, that's
[1:04:50.560 --> 1:04:55.800]  what this is. That's martial law. Oh, you don't like us raping you? Well, we'll just
[1:04:55.800 --> 1:05:02.240]  declare martial law. See all of it starting to unfold right now. Hi, folks, this is Alex

[1:06:00.000 --> 1:06:06.480]  Thank you. A very wealthy US citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important
[1:06:06.480 --> 1:06:11.720]  day in America in more than 50 years. He says it will change everything about our lives.
[1:06:11.720 --> 1:06:15.560]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children and even how you take care of
[1:06:15.560 --> 1:06:19.400]  your health and your own family. Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over
[1:06:19.400 --> 1:06:23.960]  the years. The crazy part is, he's usually right. You see, he predicted the collapse
[1:06:23.960 --> 1:06:28.720]  of GM, Danny May, Freddie Mac and America's biggest small owner, General Growth Properties.
[1:06:28.720 --> 1:06:33.680]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy. Recently, he created a video which

[1:08:24.240 --> 1:08:40.480]  Well, we're live, ladies and gentlemen. Eight minutes now into this second hour of this live,
[1:08:40.480 --> 1:08:47.960]  December 15th, 2010, Wednesday edition. And we've got Lindsey Williams joining us coming
[1:08:47.960 --> 1:08:57.280]  up here in about 23 minutes from now. His former oil company executive source has died.
[1:08:57.280 --> 1:09:01.680]  He's already revealed his full name here on air, but now he can give me the full data
[1:09:01.680 --> 1:09:09.440]  dump that he was authorized to give you after Mr. X died, and that's now happened. So we'll
[1:09:09.440 --> 1:09:15.440]  give you again for those that don't know his full name and exactly what Lindsey Williams
[1:09:15.440 --> 1:09:21.560]  is able to tell us now because he worked for many years with the head of operations for
[1:09:21.560 --> 1:09:27.560]  Atlantic Richfield, and he's now able to talk about that and what this insider said the
[1:09:27.560 --> 1:09:32.960]  globalists were planning. Now it's very evident they're accelerating global collapse to destroy
[1:09:32.960 --> 1:09:38.080]  all the major economies and currencies and set up their new SDR based on carbon taxes
[1:09:38.080 --> 1:09:45.000]  and global VAT. They are slashing pension funds, military medical treatment. They are
[1:09:45.000 --> 1:09:50.520]  going after the most outrageous things first because if they can take veterans health care,
[1:09:50.520 --> 1:09:56.800]  they can do anything. Europe, the United States, taxing pension funds, taking pension funds,
[1:09:56.800 --> 1:10:01.480]  it's all happening. They're openly talking about shutting down free speech on the web,
[1:10:01.480 --> 1:10:06.680]  tracking everyone here in the United States. Australia has announced it, headline, Australia
[1:10:06.680 --> 1:10:11.120]  to implement, Chinese style net censorship. Again, they're just thrown at your face going
[1:10:11.120 --> 1:10:19.640]  all the way now. And it's being reported all over UK news very dryly. They have the UK Metropolitan
[1:10:19.640 --> 1:10:27.520]  Police Commissioner being quoted as saying police modeling banning all UK protest. And
[1:10:27.520 --> 1:10:31.560]  Watson's getting an article out with a proper headline. When you hear about Indonesia going
[1:10:31.560 --> 1:10:39.960]  under martial law or Nigeria or Venezuela, it's always protest or banned. And then there's
[1:10:39.960 --> 1:10:43.880]  curfews. And you notice in towns all over the US, they now have curfews even in the
[1:10:43.880 --> 1:10:48.880]  daytime in Arkansas and weird places. They wouldn't expect it. In fact, people don't
[1:10:48.880 --> 1:10:56.520]  believe it just time. Arkansas town has daytime curfew. You know, Clover, Port Kentucky, daytime
[1:10:56.520 --> 1:11:03.480]  nighttime curfews off and on in the past. They're just training you to line up, have
[1:11:03.480 --> 1:11:07.880]  the government put their hands down your pants. They've now announced first it was 800 Walmarts,
[1:11:07.880 --> 1:11:16.480]  now 9,000 retail stores to have giant telescreens. See, a week ago, it's 800. A week later, it's
[1:11:16.480 --> 1:11:22.440]  9,000. A month later, it's going to be 100,000. Every license plate in California, they're
[1:11:22.440 --> 1:11:26.840]  announcing is going to have a computer screen as a light plate giving you messages and orders
[1:11:26.840 --> 1:11:32.400]  and tracking you. I mean, they are rolling out a hellish takeover. The same retina scanning
[1:11:32.400 --> 1:11:38.360]  thumb printing they do to people in Fallujah or Afghanistan or Iraq. It's coming here.
[1:11:38.360 --> 1:11:43.520]  Total control grid. They got the Threat Fusion Center CIA run here in Austin. I knew they
[1:11:43.520 --> 1:11:47.400]  had it in six, seven years ago. License plate reading, face scanning. They've now announced
[1:11:47.400 --> 1:11:52.960]  on the news they've got microphones. The feds have got microphones mounted on poles everywhere
[1:11:52.960 --> 1:11:57.120]  that it hundreds of yards away. Shoot a laser that you can't even see at your window. They
[1:11:57.120 --> 1:12:02.960]  get full acoustic audio inside your house with that laser cup link. I mean, it is just
[1:12:02.960 --> 1:12:08.840]  a hell grid and they've built this giant overarching system. They've got all their weapons and
[1:12:08.840 --> 1:12:14.840]  control and spies aimed and now they're rolling out. Yeah, censorship is good. Banning protests
[1:12:14.840 --> 1:12:22.160]  is good. Free speech zones. Yeah, your neighbors need to spy on you. Don't trust other shoppers.
[1:12:22.160 --> 1:12:28.520]  Only trust the government. Now, for the next 20 minutes or so, we are joined by Winston
[1:12:28.520 --> 1:12:36.240]  Smith and he works some with federaljack.com. I'd call it kind of a spin off, but just as
[1:12:36.240 --> 1:12:42.040]  effective and great as we are change. Do a lot of great, you know, confronting Al Gore,
[1:12:42.040 --> 1:12:47.720]  George W. Bush, other globalists, just amazing patriots, exposing the global warming fraud,
[1:12:47.720 --> 1:12:53.480]  you name it. And he joins us because he concurs with my analysis and he's seeing it now in
[1:12:53.480 --> 1:12:58.840]  the hacker community. And this guy is good, folks. He's very good. He's really a security
[1:12:58.840 --> 1:13:04.760]  consultant, aka white hat hacker. And so Winston Smith, it's good to have you here. Tell folks
[1:13:04.760 --> 1:13:10.880]  your intel on what they're planning and how they're using all of this hacking to try to
[1:13:10.880 --> 1:13:18.120]  pass their internet kill switch. Thanks for having me on. Well, basically, the group anonymous
[1:13:18.120 --> 1:13:25.280]  itself, it's not a government operation. It's not a run by the government. It's just basically
[1:13:25.280 --> 1:13:30.640]  citizens on the internet. There's not really controlled or run by anyone. But because it's
[1:13:30.640 --> 1:13:36.400]  so decentralized like that, anyone can jump on and make suggestions and basically stand
[1:13:36.400 --> 1:13:41.800]  the flames in whatever direction they want. So there are definitely opportunities within
[1:13:41.800 --> 1:13:48.400]  the anonymous community and they're definitely on their fanning the flames to promote infrastructure
[1:13:48.400 --> 1:13:54.000]  attacks and Nihila service attacks on financial systems and other systems that are end up
[1:13:54.000 --> 1:14:01.000]  affecting average people. The power that they don't really, they're too concerned about
[1:14:01.000 --> 1:14:05.880]  they'll lose service for a bit, but then they'll come right back on when everyone gets tired.
[1:14:05.880 --> 1:14:09.560]  This is the false flag on the web that I've been predicting.
[1:14:09.560 --> 1:14:17.920]  Yes, the reason they're doing that is they want to implement the government IDS sensors
[1:14:17.920 --> 1:14:23.680]  in front of things that they deem critical infrastructure. Google's already deployed
[1:14:23.680 --> 1:14:29.920]  an Einstein system and the Einstein IDS was developed by the NSA and they're really pushing
[1:14:29.920 --> 1:14:34.600]  that to have that put in front of private business networks that are deemed critical
[1:14:34.600 --> 1:14:39.200]  infrastructure. And that's the whole Homeland Security takeover with InfraGuard, clergy
[1:14:39.200 --> 1:14:46.480]  response. Basically everything is critical infrastructure. That's in the Homeland Security
[1:14:46.480 --> 1:14:52.920]  Cybersecurity Act where any ISP that has over 100 customers has to be government approved
[1:14:52.920 --> 1:14:59.200]  and have government snoop hubs in it. So it is literally internet too going out and making
[1:14:59.200 --> 1:15:04.760]  companies pay for internet too to be put in that's a parallel web to start absorbing the
[1:15:04.760 --> 1:15:08.840]  old internet and tracking everyone. Is that a correct statement?
[1:15:08.840 --> 1:15:14.240]  Yes, and they're telling it that it's going to protect you from hackers, that the sensors
[1:15:14.240 --> 1:15:18.760]  will be able to look for malicious traffic and look for attacks and be able to block
[1:15:18.760 --> 1:15:23.240]  them at the source and report it. But in reality it's going to be able to do much more than
[1:15:23.240 --> 1:15:26.000]  that. It's going to be able to have a deep packet inspection where it's going to be able
[1:15:26.000 --> 1:15:29.480]  to pretty much examine all the contents of what's coming over the wire. And they're going
[1:15:29.480 --> 1:15:33.000]  to be looking for distance and communications because that's the nature of government. That's
[1:15:33.000 --> 1:15:36.440]  what they do. They're not really interested in protecting anything.
[1:15:36.440 --> 1:15:41.000]  Absolutely. That's admitted. I saw two years ago Curt Neymar wrote an article with bizarre
[1:15:41.000 --> 1:15:45.560]  statements by Cyber Command that's already fully operating. They're trying to get legislative
[1:15:45.560 --> 1:15:50.640]  authority now to do it in the open. And they said that they were already attacking themselves
[1:15:50.640 --> 1:15:57.600]  and, quote, attacking enemies of their agenda, which Cass Sunstein and others admit is people
[1:15:57.600 --> 1:16:02.240]  like yours truly. Or anyone who disagrees with man-made global warming. Where do you
[1:16:02.240 --> 1:16:09.560]  see this going? And do you agree with my analysis that Assange is a patsy? They're trying to
[1:16:09.560 --> 1:16:17.040]  use him to make this Cass Sunstein connected, George Soros connected, movement look legitimate
[1:16:17.040 --> 1:16:23.080]  and that they're basically persecuting him to give an overall cover story to their larger
[1:16:23.080 --> 1:16:24.080]  takeover.
[1:16:24.080 --> 1:16:31.160]  From what I know about Assange, he seems legit. And it seems that because they're going after
[1:16:31.160 --> 1:16:38.560]  him so hard in so many different ways, I do believe he's a legitimate researcher. He's
[1:16:38.560 --> 1:16:46.560]  from the old school hacker ethos. Back in the 90s and the 80s from Australia, he's done
[1:16:46.560 --> 1:16:52.080]  it. He seems to have the right hacker ethos. And the way they're attacking just kind of
[1:16:52.080 --> 1:16:56.920]  lends credibility to what he's doing. But the way that mainstream media is seizing on
[1:16:56.920 --> 1:17:01.840]  a lot of the document dumps and just reporting on stuff that's promoting their agenda such
[1:17:01.840 --> 1:17:07.720]  as invading Iran and stuff like that, I think since there's 250,000 cables, they're just
[1:17:07.720 --> 1:17:10.920]  digging through and cherry picking what's going to benefit them in order to do damage
[1:17:10.920 --> 1:17:18.880]  control. But from what I can tell, Assange does seem to be, he does seem to be legit.
[1:17:18.880 --> 1:17:24.240]  You know, there's a lot of questions I can raise here or bring up to you, but clearly
[1:17:24.240 --> 1:17:29.600]  the good news is when you're looking at all the big hacker sites and forums to paraphrase
[1:17:29.600 --> 1:17:34.760]  what you said or correct me if I'm wrong, 99% of the time nobody is biting on joining
[1:17:34.760 --> 1:17:43.040]  with these provocateurs to go after alternative media, patriot groups, but also a key infrastructure
[1:17:43.040 --> 1:17:51.800]  and individuals to create a pushback and a really corporate and grassroots support for
[1:17:51.800 --> 1:17:55.800]  do something about these hackers, you know, put a muzzle on the Internet.
[1:17:55.800 --> 1:18:02.600]  Right. The attacks on anything beyond really attacks on the financial sector aren't really
[1:18:02.600 --> 1:18:06.720]  gaining much steam. They just not kind of seem to be puttering out because the way it
[1:18:06.720 --> 1:18:12.360]  works is a post will be made or a suggestion will be made and if the group of people who
[1:18:12.360 --> 1:18:15.760]  are monitoring at the time or participating at the time don't get behind it, the idea
[1:18:15.760 --> 1:18:20.360]  just flutters out. So you'll see disruptive things being suggested right now then, but
[1:18:20.360 --> 1:18:26.040]  you know, thankfully they're so far just petering out and when they do take place like attacks
[1:18:26.040 --> 1:18:33.480]  on the financial industry, they're arresting kids and low-hanging groups. The groups they're
[1:18:33.480 --> 1:18:39.280]  using are something called the low-impact, low-orbit, low-orbit Ion Cannon, the LOIC,
[1:18:39.280 --> 1:18:42.960]  and it's basically an opt-in pocket where you just run it from your computer and it'll
[1:18:42.960 --> 1:18:46.960]  start opening connections on a website and they'll get a few thousand people to do this
[1:18:46.960 --> 1:18:52.080]  and it'll take the website down, but the program by default doesn't offer any proxying
[1:18:52.080 --> 1:18:58.280]  support, so it traces directly back to your computer and they're arresting 15 to 17-year-old
[1:18:58.280 --> 1:19:02.720]  kids. I think they just arrested a 19-year-old kid who was running the software and needle-pinning
[1:19:02.720 --> 1:19:03.720]  data.
[1:19:03.720 --> 1:19:09.620]  Yeah, we've seen operatives openly on YouTube recruiting people to run these attacks on
[1:19:09.620 --> 1:19:15.040]  InfoWars and PrisonPlanet and we've tracked it back and are pretty sure that it's Homeland
[1:19:15.040 --> 1:19:21.600]  Security doing it, posing as hackers and it's just ongoing, so that's important for
[1:19:21.600 --> 1:19:26.480]  people to know that they're just busting a few kids and not going after, you know, the
[1:19:26.480 --> 1:19:31.120]  really malicious stuff, which in every case we've looked at is a staged event.
[1:19:31.120 --> 1:19:37.320]  And there's some other campaigns that different anonymous groups are doing and they're actually
[1:19:37.320 --> 1:19:43.800]  very productive. They're encouraging people to read the WikiLeaks document and actually
[1:19:43.800 --> 1:19:44.800] ...
[1:19:44.800 --> 1:19:50.520]  Yeah, stay there because exactly, that's the big news coming up. You say there's about
[1:19:50.520 --> 1:19:55.760]  to be some real WikiLeaking going on and instead of just cherry picking, really getting
[1:19:55.760 --> 1:19:59.920]  into those documents and getting stuff out there like Dinecore running little kids, we'll
[1:19:59.920 --> 1:20:01.800]  be right back.
[1:20:01.800 --> 1:20:05.360]  Is it really possible to get out of debt without payment plans or attorneys?
[1:20:05.360 --> 1:20:10.400]  18 years ago, we developed a program that has made thousands debt-free in just 90 days.
[1:20:10.400 --> 1:20:15.240]  It's called Zero Debt in 90 Days and it works for all credit card debt, medical bills, even
[1:20:15.240 --> 1:20:16.600]  collection lawsuits.
[1:20:16.600 --> 1:20:21.480]  When I first joined, I was being sued, so I used the program methods and after filing
[1:20:21.480 --> 1:20:25.120]  one piece of paper, the collection lawsuit was dismissed.
[1:20:25.120 --> 1:20:29.440]  With Zero Debt in 90 Days, your success is guaranteed in writing. There is no other program
[1:20:29.440 --> 1:20:30.440]  of its kind.
[1:20:30.440 --> 1:20:34.440]  Don't be alone when creditors gang up on you. Let our team of experts provide the resources

[1:21:01.040 --> 1:21:06.720]  Jim Newcomer, Formatus Resources, December 22, 2010, Gold Open this morning at $13.8830.
[1:21:06.720 --> 1:21:14.520]  A one-ounce gold coin can be purchased for $14.2423, $7.1211 for a half-ounce, or $35606
[1:21:14.520 --> 1:21:20.920]  for a quarter-ounce. That's $14.2423, $7.1211, or $35606.
[1:21:20.920 --> 1:21:24.760]  Again the Congressional Budget Office sounds the alarm warning of Greek-style U.S. debt
[1:21:24.760 --> 1:21:30.440]  crises. CBO is drawing a parallel between U.S. economy and the Greek economic meltdown.
[1:21:30.440 --> 1:21:35.440]  Debt to GDP climbing to unfamiliar territory and deficits rising to unsupportable levels.
[1:21:35.440 --> 1:21:40.160]  Hi, Ted Anderson, the federal debt and risk of financial crises document the CBO has
[1:21:40.160 --> 1:21:44.920]  published is a must-read for every American. Covering the risks of deficit spending, aging
[1:21:44.920 --> 1:21:48.840]  population and rising interest rates spells economic disaster.
[1:21:48.840 --> 1:21:57.040]  Call today at 800-686-2237. I'll send it free. Again, call 800-686-2237. Ask for the CBO
[1:21:57.040 --> 1:22:00.960]  document. Call 800-686-2237.
[1:22:00.960 --> 1:22:06.160]  They help to create a new world order. We are part of a new world order. A new world
[1:22:06.160 --> 1:22:11.880]  order based upon collective action. Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists
[1:22:11.880 --> 1:22:16.640]  through their own words and documents. The new world order really is a tool for addressing
[1:22:16.640 --> 1:22:20.960]  a new world of possibilities. It means all the world under their control.
[1:22:20.960 --> 1:22:25.800]  The United Nations would take over America. The Trilateral Commission would control the
[1:22:25.800 --> 1:22:29.240]  world. Invisible Empire Chronicles, how men of power
[1:22:29.240 --> 1:22:34.480]  and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[1:22:34.480 --> 1:22:38.600]  I believe, first of all, that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for
[1:22:38.600 --> 1:22:41.760]  the global financial system. Global governance with the establishment
[1:22:41.760 --> 1:22:45.080]  of the G20. So it's going to be an inner, ruling elite
[1:22:45.080 --> 1:22:48.920]  and then everyone else. And I got news for you. You're everyone else.

[1:23:15.400 --> 1:23:19.280]  It's inspiring for many who are affected by the recent downturn of the economy.
[1:23:19.280 --> 1:23:23.400]  I already knew a bit about foraging and edibles, but you take it to a whole new level.
[1:23:23.400 --> 1:23:27.360]  A thousand thanks to you for all that great knowledge. It was empowering.
[1:23:27.360 --> 1:23:31.440]  When I was in the Navy, I went through a couple of quick land survival classes.
[1:23:31.440 --> 1:23:34.040]  Thank you for being an inspiration and for all the work that you do.
[1:23:34.040 --> 1:23:37.080]  I really appreciate the depth and detail of the information.

[1:23:58.400 --> 1:24:25.080]  the secret.
[1:24:25.080 --> 1:24:29.960]  Winston Smith White Hat Hacker is our guest and I'm going to keep him about five minutes
[1:24:29.960 --> 1:24:32.840]  in the next segment and then get Lindsay Williams on.
[1:24:32.840 --> 1:24:34.000]  You've got a lot to say.
[1:24:34.000 --> 1:24:41.440]  You say the real people involved with Anonymous are doing some really exciting things and
[1:24:41.440 --> 1:24:43.400]  there's a lot more to come.
[1:24:43.400 --> 1:24:46.400]  You've got the floor.
[1:24:46.400 --> 1:24:50.120]  Movements from some factions of Anonymous that are encouraging people to actually read
[1:24:50.120 --> 1:24:55.360]  the WikiLeaks documents and look for stuff that's not being discussed in any media, like
[1:24:55.360 --> 1:24:59.240]  the latest thing with the DineCourse sex candle where there are seven boys to ask and police
[1:24:59.240 --> 1:25:00.240]  courses.
[1:25:00.240 --> 1:25:05.560]  That came out in a Houston Chronicle blog and so basically they're encouraging people
[1:25:05.560 --> 1:25:09.840]  to start coming through the cables, there's 250,000 of them, there's going to be plenty
[1:25:09.840 --> 1:25:14.880]  that mainstream media is not touching and then put up a YouTube video, put up a free
[1:25:14.880 --> 1:25:18.880]  blog page, write one or two paragraphs about it and then start spamming it around and
[1:25:18.880 --> 1:25:22.360]  then that way the information will go viral because the new road order doesn't really
[1:25:22.360 --> 1:25:27.080]  fear 16-year-olds doing denial of service attacks but they do fear the information from those
[1:25:27.080 --> 1:25:28.400]  cable leaks getting out.
[1:25:28.400 --> 1:25:36.160]  I also want to put out a call for programmers so I guess contact either federaljack.com
[1:25:36.160 --> 1:25:43.800]  or nforward.com directly and we basically put together an opt-in botnet that's similar
[1:25:43.800 --> 1:25:50.040]  to the LOIC but that is not destructive so instead of doing denial of service attacks
[1:25:50.040 --> 1:25:57.120]  they can do things like do Google searches or upvote YouTube videos and upvote dig articles
[1:25:57.120 --> 1:26:02.560]  and in that way when important information comes out everyone can dedicate their resources
[1:26:02.560 --> 1:26:09.440]  to making the information as viral as possible and with the success of the Googlebomb campaigns
[1:26:09.440 --> 1:26:14.120]  that have been going on right now it could be automated with some kind of client software.
[1:26:14.120 --> 1:26:19.360]  I think that would have a real big impact and so basically we need to find programmers
[1:26:19.360 --> 1:26:20.800]  who can help do that.
[1:26:20.800 --> 1:26:27.160]  Well expanding on that, the globalists are masters of creating the type of fake revolution
[1:26:27.160 --> 1:26:35.840]  they want because they can look at a trend societally of what they're doing and know
[1:26:35.840 --> 1:26:37.720]  that people are going to resist it.
[1:26:37.720 --> 1:26:42.640]  So ahead of time they will go out and frame the debate so they're always promoting hacking
[1:26:42.640 --> 1:26:48.720]  with just denial of service or things that are destructive to demonize people being
[1:26:48.720 --> 1:26:56.160]  activist with technology so that being an activist with technology is seen as inherently
[1:26:56.160 --> 1:26:57.160]  dirty.
[1:26:57.160 --> 1:27:01.400]  You go back to the 1940s and 50s with the British and this has been declassified but
[1:27:01.400 --> 1:27:07.680]  they use a similar model today in Kenya and the government wanted to crack down and take
[1:27:07.680 --> 1:27:13.400]  over society and so they went and financed rebel groups and then used those groups as
[1:27:13.400 --> 1:27:19.080]  the foggy scary enemy to take over and steal people's property and enslave people and it's
[1:27:19.080 --> 1:27:20.240]  the same thing.
[1:27:20.240 --> 1:27:26.320]  They're there setting up a sange, burning him, he's being used to then get everybody
[1:27:26.320 --> 1:27:31.680]  angry and then get folks to go out and vandalize the web as a pretext to come control it.
[1:27:31.680 --> 1:27:35.680]  I know I've already said that several times but that's a different way of saying it.
[1:27:35.680 --> 1:27:40.640]  This is really important and it's just like the feds got caught in the early 90s going
[1:27:40.640 --> 1:27:48.440]  out and creating militia groups, making them violent to demonize real militia groups.
[1:27:48.440 --> 1:27:49.440]  This is how they do it.
[1:27:49.440 --> 1:27:50.440]  Any comments on that?
[1:27:50.440 --> 1:27:58.120]  Yes, exactly what they're doing and real coming up soon is a United Nations meeting
[1:27:58.120 --> 1:28:03.600]  on internet security around the world so it's real convenient that that's being scheduled
[1:28:03.600 --> 1:28:05.000]  right after all of this.
[1:28:05.000 --> 1:28:11.280]  And notice right now Winston, they are trying to pass the cyber security.
[1:28:11.280 --> 1:28:15.800]  They've got these new bills where you could be given life in prison or executed if you
[1:28:15.800 --> 1:28:17.840]  put anything classified out.
[1:28:17.840 --> 1:28:20.840]  The government's classifying everything now.
[1:28:20.840 --> 1:28:26.360]  This is how you disappear to prison in the new Nazi Germany is they say national security.
[1:28:26.360 --> 1:28:29.520]  It was the same thing in Nazi Germany or Soviet Russia.
[1:28:29.520 --> 1:28:33.400]  Now in England they're saying we may ban all protest.
[1:28:33.400 --> 1:28:34.640]  That's martial law.
[1:28:34.640 --> 1:28:39.840]  I mean, notice right as the economic implosion happens, they're announcing all of this just
[1:28:39.840 --> 1:28:44.360]  as we warned people because we've read the Rand Corporation documents.
[1:28:44.360 --> 1:28:47.760]  We know what their next move is.
[1:28:47.760 --> 1:28:53.720]  And talking on that bill I think in Congress now they're making it illegal to publish any
[1:28:53.720 --> 1:28:54.720]  classified information.
[1:28:54.720 --> 1:29:00.240]  Basically they want to make it illegal to revealing the source document of anything
[1:29:00.240 --> 1:29:06.600]  that they deem as national security and naming an informant, even if that informant's name
[1:29:06.600 --> 1:29:08.600]  is publicly known, it's been reported in the media.
[1:29:08.600 --> 1:29:13.120]  If you utter that person's name, it can be charged with felony and it's crazy.
[1:29:13.120 --> 1:29:14.800]  And folks, I've read sections of the bill.
[1:29:14.800 --> 1:29:19.160]  This is really happening and they had all this stuff already written.
[1:29:19.160 --> 1:29:22.680]  They've already proposed it before and failed and this is the new tyranny.
[1:29:22.680 --> 1:29:27.560]  Oh, you don't go to a camp because you're Jewish or because you're a seventh day Adventist.
[1:29:27.560 --> 1:29:33.240]  You go to a camp because you release the Mayak or homeland security report.
[1:29:33.240 --> 1:29:38.560]  You can see where this is going and as usual they've got mindless fake conservatives leading
[1:29:38.560 --> 1:29:42.000]  the charge to execute Julian Assange.
[1:29:42.000 --> 1:29:43.440]  What a barrel of idiots.
[1:29:43.440 --> 1:29:49.040]  I got a few final questions for you, our white hat hacker security expert, Winston Smith
[1:29:49.040 --> 1:29:50.040]  joins us.
[1:29:50.040 --> 1:29:51.880]  We'll be right back.
[1:29:51.880 --> 1:29:53.160]  We're on the march.
[1:29:53.160 --> 1:29:55.640]  The Empire's on the run.
[1:29:55.640 --> 1:30:03.120]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[1:30:03.120 --> 1:30:06.840]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[1:30:06.840 --> 1:30:10.000]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[1:30:10.000 --> 1:30:14.360]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans
[1:30:14.360 --> 1:30:15.360]  at home.
[1:30:15.360 --> 1:30:20.000]  I've turned a tremendous influence on our president in Congress and they really are
[1:30:20.000 --> 1:30:21.000]  calling the shots.
[1:30:21.000 --> 1:30:26.280]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[1:30:26.280 --> 1:30:31.760]  Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal off-short cartel
[1:30:31.760 --> 1:30:36.400]  held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[1:30:36.400 --> 1:30:40.920]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke and Arsonists, they're asking for more matches and the Congress is
[1:30:40.920 --> 1:30:42.840]  saying, who do we make the checkout to?
[1:30:42.840 --> 1:30:49.000]  Today it seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of
[1:30:49.000 --> 1:30:50.000]  the Republic.
[1:30:50.000 --> 1:30:56.760]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at infowars.com or watch it online right now

[1:31:59.840 --> 1:32:00.960]  Thank you.
[1:32:00.960 --> 1:32:05.600]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[1:32:05.600 --> 1:32:09.920]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[1:32:09.920 --> 1:32:14.240]  Number two, our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company
[1:32:14.240 --> 1:32:15.560]  allows you to have.
[1:32:15.560 --> 1:32:21.280]  It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[1:32:21.280 --> 1:32:25.600]  Number three, in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and
[1:32:25.600 --> 1:32:29.600]  now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[1:32:29.600 --> 1:32:33.080]  Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[1:32:33.080 --> 1:32:36.800]  Every year thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages.
[1:32:36.800 --> 1:32:41.560]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[1:32:41.560 --> 1:32:45.320]  Folks I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science.
[1:32:45.320 --> 1:32:46.720]  One of my old sponsors.
[1:32:46.720 --> 1:32:50.960]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[1:32:50.960 --> 1:32:52.640]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[1:32:52.640 --> 1:33:09.840]  The government doesn't own the sun so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[1:33:09.840 --> 1:33:23.920]  Speaking of frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones on the
[1:33:23.920 --> 1:33:24.920]  GZN Radio Network.
[1:33:24.920 --> 1:33:29.360]  I was talking to a real estate broker who's a friend of mine last night and she's a
[1:33:29.360 --> 1:33:33.120]  listener of the show but I guess it never clicked.
[1:33:33.120 --> 1:33:38.720]  She was watching Nightly News and they were announcing that your credit report, everything
[1:33:38.720 --> 1:33:45.480]  you're doing in business, your online activity is all being now sent to the government starting
[1:33:45.480 --> 1:33:46.480]  next year.
[1:33:46.480 --> 1:33:49.720]  That's already been the case for a long time.
[1:33:49.720 --> 1:33:55.520]  But in live time, they announced three weeks ago in Wired Magazine, the government admits
[1:33:55.520 --> 1:34:02.240]  we're watching all your credit card purchases, your loyalty cards, they're just getting rid
[1:34:02.240 --> 1:34:06.240]  of any denial.
[1:34:06.240 --> 1:34:12.600]  They're just coming right out and saying, there's no pretense of privacy.
[1:34:12.600 --> 1:34:16.520]  And these are felonies they're committing.
[1:34:16.520 --> 1:34:20.280]  I mean just five years ago, people would go to jail for this in government.
[1:34:20.280 --> 1:34:23.840]  Now they just say, look, we're doing it.
[1:34:23.840 --> 1:34:29.200]  And then we get their internal documents and it's all about us and stealing from us.
[1:34:29.200 --> 1:34:32.520]  Nothing to do with the men in turbines who by the way on record have been caught working
[1:34:32.520 --> 1:34:36.200]  for them or who are provocateur by them over and over again.
[1:34:36.200 --> 1:34:40.400]  William's is coming up here in a few minutes, but I wanted our white hat hacker.
[1:34:40.400 --> 1:34:45.840]  Again, we'll just call him Winston Smith from federaljack.com.
[1:34:45.840 --> 1:34:49.000]  Winston any other tidbits you want to add and then some of the guys in there, Matt
[1:34:49.000 --> 1:34:54.120]  Ryan and others, they wanted to talk about the fact that Microsoft routinely goes to
[1:34:54.120 --> 1:34:58.880]  hacker conferences and gives the source code out to new Windows versions and says, try
[1:34:58.880 --> 1:35:04.280]  to break it if you can and that the government has in Google and others, which is basically
[1:35:04.280 --> 1:35:08.720]  the government really tries to recruit all the hackers they can to then work for them.
[1:35:08.720 --> 1:35:14.280]  I guess on the dark side, what percentage of hackers out there are awake now to this
[1:35:14.280 --> 1:35:15.880]  whole new world order system?
[1:35:15.880 --> 1:35:19.520]  Your comments on the general points I just made.
[1:35:19.520 --> 1:35:24.440]  The government and military industrial complex contractors are definitely a hacker conference
[1:35:24.440 --> 1:35:28.760]  is recruiting pretty confined at any at any one of these major conferences.
[1:35:28.760 --> 1:35:34.440]  You find Booz Allen Hamilton, Lockheed Martin and Raytheon, they're all out there looking
[1:35:34.440 --> 1:35:35.440]  for people.
[1:35:35.440 --> 1:35:40.520]  NSA gives away scholarships at another one I know of.
[1:35:40.520 --> 1:35:47.080]  A lot of hackers are aware of what's going on, but they're still kind of getting the
[1:35:47.080 --> 1:35:54.760]  jobs, doing the stuff that they're very lucrative paying jobs and whether or not they're keeping
[1:35:54.760 --> 1:35:57.400]  their original ethics when they're taking these jobs.
[1:35:57.400 --> 1:36:02.000]  I don't know, but a lot of hackers are aware of what's going on, but they're also getting
[1:36:02.000 --> 1:36:11.760]  jobs within the systems that they can basically live and that might be a good thing, that
[1:36:11.760 --> 1:36:13.640]  might be a bad thing.
[1:36:13.640 --> 1:36:18.560]  It's pretty much from what people I talk to when I'm out there, a lot of people know
[1:36:18.560 --> 1:36:24.520]  what's going on and they're in agreement, but they'll still work for the government
[1:36:24.520 --> 1:36:27.800]  or for a defense contractor.
[1:36:27.800 --> 1:36:33.720]  It's clearly that old double-edged sword of it's good because as long as the hackers
[1:36:33.720 --> 1:36:38.320]  are into liberty and freedom, it's great to have them inside the system.
[1:36:38.320 --> 1:36:42.960]  The problem is that system is so corrupt and murderous that many times they go ahead and
[1:36:42.960 --> 1:36:48.480]  just set people up even if you haven't betrayed the system just because they want to have
[1:36:48.480 --> 1:36:50.080]  a conviction on you.
[1:36:50.080 --> 1:36:55.860]  So it's very destructive and overall we need people that have knowledge of all these systems
[1:36:55.860 --> 1:37:01.640]  to be out there exposing the globalist as much as they can, but it is creepy to have
[1:37:01.640 --> 1:37:06.880]  you and many others confirm to us and send us the data that the government is out there
[1:37:06.880 --> 1:37:11.280]  trying to move against what we're doing, the alternative media, and then the great thing
[1:37:11.280 --> 1:37:17.320]  for the globalist is they can engage in these activities and then blame it on the rest of
[1:37:17.320 --> 1:37:19.400]  the hacker community.
[1:37:19.400 --> 1:37:24.520]  A lot of the hackers that they're using for that are criminal informants, like in the
[1:37:24.520 --> 1:37:29.160]  with the DJX breach, the main hacker that was behind that was a secret service informant
[1:37:29.160 --> 1:37:33.960]  getting paid $8,000 a year and at the same time he was the same guy who was doing all
[1:37:33.960 --> 1:37:38.520]  these credit card breaches, getting millions of credit card numbers and then they use that
[1:37:38.520 --> 1:37:47.480]  as if you start clamping down on basically internet freedoms and monitoring financial
[1:37:47.480 --> 1:37:51.400]  transactions, looking for fraud because your credit card is probably compromised by this
[1:37:51.400 --> 1:37:55.000]  guy, but he was working for a secret service at the same time getting paid $80,000 a year
[1:37:55.000 --> 1:37:58.120]  and then that was in Wired Magazine.
[1:37:58.120 --> 1:38:02.320]  So once you work for the government it's also just a license to engage in criminal activity.
[1:38:02.320 --> 1:38:05.920]  That seems to be the trend.
[1:38:05.920 --> 1:38:09.840]  They burned him pretty bad though for when they caught him.
[1:38:09.840 --> 1:38:14.800]  He got sentenced to 25 years for credit card theft, which is unheard of.
[1:38:14.800 --> 1:38:22.120]  If you kill someone you can get 10 years but if you steal their credit card you get 25.
[1:38:22.120 --> 1:38:25.680]  Well that could bring down the entire system, all of this fraud that's going on and so many
[1:38:25.680 --> 1:38:30.280]  times it's come out that the big banks are actually releasing this themselves and then
[1:38:30.280 --> 1:38:35.200]  using it as a pretext to try to bring in even more control because they can then put regulations
[1:38:35.200 --> 1:38:39.960]  in that are so strong only mega banks will be able to comply with all of it.
[1:38:39.960 --> 1:38:45.280]  Winston Smith, good talking to you and appreciate all of your help and continue the great work
[1:38:45.280 --> 1:38:50.720]  there at Federal Jack and we are changed and we'll talk to you again soon.
[1:38:50.720 --> 1:38:56.880]  Now for the rest of this hour and much of the next but I do have some other economic
[1:38:56.880 --> 1:39:02.160]  news, world news, police state news I've got to get to and we probably should just have
[1:39:02.160 --> 1:39:08.040]  open phones today talking about the shooting, it's so dramatic to have the footage of it
[1:39:08.040 --> 1:39:15.720]  deranged person there in Florida I mean just so many acts of heroism by the lady hitting
[1:39:15.720 --> 1:39:21.040]  him with the bag in the back of the head with the purse and one of the school board people
[1:39:21.040 --> 1:39:30.640]  saying well if I'm the bad guy go ahead and kill me just let everybody else go and it's
[1:39:30.640 --> 1:39:39.840]  just all wild and the roller coaster is just getting going I mean society is going to get
[1:39:39.840 --> 1:39:46.240]  crazier and crazier from here on out we're going to look back on 2010 and see it as tame
[1:39:46.240 --> 1:39:55.000]  good old days but the fact is we're going into this the question is will we come out
[1:39:55.000 --> 1:40:00.040]  on the other side totally enslaved or will we come out on the other side rediscovering
[1:40:00.040 --> 1:40:05.880]  liberty and freedom and rediscovering independence and rediscovering real community and discovering
[1:40:05.880 --> 1:40:10.800]  real values of liberty and freedom because liberty is the engine of wealth but with liberty
[1:40:10.800 --> 1:40:15.680]  comes wealth then comes decadence then comes enslavement because people stop standing up
[1:40:15.680 --> 1:40:22.720]  for freedom we're going to go to Lindsay Williams with a giant data dump of information unfortunately
[1:40:22.720 --> 1:40:26.320]  Mr. X we can now reveal his name he revealed it a month ago here on air but now the poor

[1:43:28.560 --> 1:43:32.000]  didn't believe in any of this till he was in there only person ever allowed in their
[1:43:32.000 --> 1:43:36.600]  annals because he'd written books that they were favorable to the bestseller we went to

[1:44:05.240 --> 1:44:09.560]  our local AM and FM affiliates they are so wonderful if you're a local listener and
[1:44:09.560 --> 1:44:15.200]  have a business sponsor that local station spread the word about that station we're
[1:44:15.200 --> 1:44:19.640]  all doing this together we are getting so many new affiliates it is so exciting the
[1:44:19.640 --> 1:44:25.280]  stations are getting great ratings which shows the truth sells people couldn't believe this
[1:44:25.280 --> 1:44:29.720]  stuff 10 years ago when I was telling them now it's all coming true it's out in the open
[1:44:29.720 --> 1:44:34.000]  and we've just got to have the will to face it and do something about it and you think
[1:44:34.000 --> 1:44:39.400]  it's scary to come out and expose Dying Corp for running giant child kidnapping rings worldwide
[1:44:39.400 --> 1:44:45.000]  they run the local CPS right here in Texas I mean think about the ramifications of that
[1:44:45.000 --> 1:44:49.200]  but it's in the WikiLeaks documents has been in mainstream news for years there's new stuff
[1:44:49.200 --> 1:44:53.040]  I mean you know it's got to be done like I'm getting a sick feeling just thinking about
[1:44:53.040 --> 1:44:59.320]  it but folks this is so real that's why new listeners tune in and they think there's no
[1:44:59.320 --> 1:45:06.080]  way this could be real because it's so shocking it's much worse than I can even tell you okay
[1:45:06.080 --> 1:45:10.240]  all right folks I want to shift gears he'll be with us until the last 15 minutes of the
[1:45:10.240 --> 1:45:14.880]  next hour we appreciate him joining us but I got a news blitz coming up then plus this
[1:45:14.880 --> 1:45:18.840]  incredible news they're announcing they may have full bore martial law in England that's
[1:45:18.840 --> 1:45:22.600]  what this announcement means saying no protest nationwide Watson's getting an article out
[1:45:22.600 --> 1:45:29.200]  on that right now at prisonblinded.com but things are just getting crazier and crazier
[1:45:29.200 --> 1:45:35.960]  by the minute but going to Lindsay Williams he was a pastor and was in the board meetings
[1:45:35.960 --> 1:45:41.200]  is their official chaplain for many years on the trans Alaska pipeline it's got more
[1:45:41.200 --> 1:45:46.400]  oil in Saudi Arabia he was there and watched him shut it off and not let him ship it out
[1:45:46.400 --> 1:45:51.880]  he was privy to all of that and decades after he wrote his book that's all mainstream knowledge
[1:45:51.880 --> 1:45:56.040]  you know again people are like this stuff's wild what Williams is saying well I happen
[1:45:56.040 --> 1:45:59.720]  to know that everything he talked about 25 years ago came true because it was already
[1:45:59.720 --> 1:46:06.320]  real and he predicted that gas would go from 60 dollars a barrel to 150 and six months
[1:46:06.320 --> 1:46:10.400]  it happened he you know he's predicted so much here because of his sources he's got
[1:46:10.400 --> 1:46:15.040]  two former oil company executives one of them has just died and completely spilt his guts
[1:46:15.040 --> 1:46:21.400]  before he died Mr. Rex we gave his name out a month ago when Williams was here but Williams
[1:46:21.400 --> 1:46:25.200]  just briefly recapping sir and I appreciate you joining us coming on a little bit late
[1:46:25.200 --> 1:46:32.320]  I had to finish up with that WikiLeaks hacker insider information but just recap Mr. Rex
[1:46:32.320 --> 1:46:37.680]  his name what the family said when he passed and then the stuff that you couldn't talk
[1:46:37.680 --> 1:46:43.480]  about until he had died well Alex thank you for allowing me to be on your show today because
[1:46:43.480 --> 1:46:49.600]  that's that's correct the Mr. Rex of my book it is you know in crisis there were actually
[1:46:49.600 --> 1:46:56.200]  two of them one of them just passed away days ago his name is Ken from now if any of you
[1:46:56.200 --> 1:47:01.520]  would like to do what Alex has done you could go and find it for yourself find out his position
[1:47:01.520 --> 1:47:08.000]  find out his place realize that he positively one of was one of the elitist of the world
[1:47:08.000 --> 1:47:13.520]  and before this man passed away he told me everything and you're going to hear some
[1:47:13.520 --> 1:47:19.160]  things today for the very first time because out of respect for the family until after
[1:47:19.160 --> 1:47:24.120]  the funeral I did not want to say certain things now Alex I know on the last show I
[1:47:24.120 --> 1:47:29.960]  did with you back probably a month ago you were pushing real hard to get me to say what
[1:47:29.960 --> 1:47:34.840]  might have been told me but out of respect for the family I felt that I had to hold back
[1:47:34.840 --> 1:47:42.120]  certain things until after he died now he is dead therefore I'm going to give you today
[1:47:42.120 --> 1:47:47.720]  many of the things that he told me now Alex I feel so fortunate though because you've
[1:47:47.720 --> 1:47:53.080]  heard me say many times that by the providence of God all of these things that happened
[1:47:53.080 --> 1:47:59.600]  the fact that I was the chaplain on the trans-alaskan oil pipeline literally lived with the elite
[1:47:59.600 --> 1:48:05.200]  of the world for three years had the opportunity to sit across the dinner table from the believe
[1:48:05.200 --> 1:48:09.880]  in the same dorms with the people that you hear about in the World Bank the IMF the top
[1:48:09.880 --> 1:48:15.000]  oil company officials of the world I take no credit for any of that all of that is by
[1:48:15.000 --> 1:48:21.000]  the providence of God and something else has just happened that I think has got to be the
[1:48:21.000 --> 1:48:28.640]  providence of God after Ken from died he second misdirection my book energy nine crisis was
[1:48:28.640 --> 1:48:34.320]  kept in touch with me on a very regular basis for the past 35 years he said on the phone
[1:48:34.320 --> 1:48:39.840]  one day he said chaplain Williams I know now that Ken has been giving you a lot of information
[1:48:39.840 --> 1:48:47.120]  and has passed away he said would you like for me to continue to fill his shoes and you
[1:48:47.120 --> 1:48:52.120]  do you give you the information I did not ask for that he volunteered it and again Alex
[1:48:52.120 --> 1:48:57.600]  I think it is by the providence of God so that hopefully I will be able to continue
[1:48:57.600 --> 1:49:04.760]  to warn the world of things that these elitists have planned on an ongoing basis now why you
[1:49:04.760 --> 1:49:09.800]  know who the second person is sure even more high level than Mr. from but we won't give
[1:49:09.800 --> 1:49:16.680]  about that name but but going back here from began to repent correct me if I'm wrong what
[1:49:16.680 --> 1:49:22.920]  is the position of this other guy I mean is he not walking what's happening or is he just
[1:49:22.920 --> 1:49:29.320]  enjoying telling us about our fate well this gentleman won't the information to get out
[1:49:29.320 --> 1:49:36.440]  he's retired he's 69 years of age he's the one that was cured of cancer he has a very
[1:49:36.440 --> 1:49:43.400]  close relationship with me and as a result he would like to see everything known in fact

[1:55:49.440 --> 1:55:55.840]  back about two and a half years ago on your program i said that mr from had called me at the time i
[1:55:55.840 --> 1:56:01.120]  couldn't give his name i said he just called me today and said that the price of crude oil is
[1:56:01.120 --> 1:56:07.600]  going from 147 dollars a barrel to 50 dollars a barrel at the time you were paying four dollars a
[1:56:07.600 --> 1:56:13.120]  gallon of the gas about two and a half years ago now within two months it was exactly like this
[1:56:13.120 --> 1:56:19.360]  man had told me it happened folks i am pleading with you today i am going to give you some
[1:56:19.360 --> 1:56:26.400]  signs that mr from and others have given to me and if you want to spare your household some
[1:56:26.400 --> 1:56:33.920]  heartaches you can do it but you've got to make certain preparations and and do certain things
[1:56:33.920 --> 1:56:40.400]  as far as your mindset is concerned and do it right now now i was told by mr from before he died
[1:56:40.960 --> 1:56:46.080]  uh that certain things were going to happen again with oil do you remember i told you
[1:56:46.080 --> 1:56:51.600]  that they were going to keep the price of crude oil about 70 dollars a barrel for for a period of
[1:56:51.600 --> 1:56:57.120]  time at least a year will it get that way for two and a half years and then on the previous
[1:56:57.120 --> 1:57:02.240]  show that i did with alec i said alec's price now is going to change he's going up well it's
[1:57:02.240 --> 1:57:06.480]  going up to 90 dollars a barrel and he's going to continue to go i'll tell you where it's going
[1:57:06.480 --> 1:57:11.840]  you said in the next six to eight months it would rise massively and as soon as you were on it began
[1:57:11.840 --> 1:57:17.600]  rising go ahead well that's what they told me i mean i had no way of knowing this just like i had
[1:57:17.600 --> 1:57:22.000]  no way of knowing that it was going to go down to a dollar and 50 cents a gallon that the gas pump
[1:57:22.000 --> 1:57:27.440]  back two and a half years ago i had no way of knowing it was going to go back up to 150 to 200
[1:57:27.440 --> 1:57:35.040]  dollars a barrel now right now right here in phoenix arizona today we are over three dollars a gallon
[1:57:35.040 --> 1:57:40.880]  for regular the cheap stuff in california it's four dollars a gallon right now you haven't seen
[1:57:40.880 --> 1:57:48.800]  anything yet i have been told it is going to 150 dollars a barrel to 200 dollars a barrel depending
[1:57:48.800 --> 1:57:55.120]  on how far they can push the american people it is going to drastically impact our economy it is
[1:57:55.120 --> 1:58:00.480]  already three dollars a gallon here in phoenix arizona you are going to see four to five dollars a
[1:58:00.480 --> 1:58:05.680]  gallon of the gas pump in the very near future six to nine months they'll take it as high as they can
[1:58:05.680 --> 1:58:10.080]  and they want it to go to 200 dollars a barrel now and they get back to what alex just mentioned the
[1:58:10.080 --> 1:58:15.600]  euro folks this is so important i mean yes you're right this has been on the media with the elite
[1:58:15.600 --> 1:58:20.160]  knew this before the media ever knew it because all the media is doing is forcing what the elite
[1:58:20.160 --> 1:58:26.080]  want them to say the european union is going to have a major problem the euro will see a collapse
[1:58:26.080 --> 1:58:33.680]  first before the american dollar whenever the you see the euro collapse you have two to three weeks

[2:00:14.080 --> 2:00:23.920]  he's alex jones on the gcn radio network and now live from austin texas alex jones
[2:00:28.080 --> 2:00:34.000]  ladies and gentlemen lindsay williams has got the sources from his years working
[2:00:34.560 --> 2:00:40.240]  with the ceo's and directors of several major oil companies as their official chaplain in their
[2:00:40.240 --> 2:00:45.920]  board meetings he was their buddy they took fishing he was the guy that hung out with him
[2:00:46.480 --> 2:00:52.160]  and he kept these contacts through the years and it's it's always been a great boon to our
[2:00:52.160 --> 2:01:00.640]  intelligence to see what's happening now he just joined us his source dropped major bomb shells
[2:01:03.200 --> 2:01:08.320]  both the former ceo of a company and then the other former director of another company
[2:01:08.320 --> 2:01:15.360]  who just died mr from everything they talk about dealing with uh energy prices has been a hundred
[2:01:15.360 --> 2:01:22.480]  percent on and uh lindsay this is a short segment but but please get into it for people right now
[2:01:23.040 --> 2:01:27.760]  without the break interrupting you specifically what he said about the euro is going down
[2:01:27.760 --> 2:01:35.440]  did he give timeframes and he said two to three weeks to quote do what once it goes down i am
[2:01:35.440 --> 2:01:41.760]  trying my best to spare you haughty by giving you these things that they've given to me and people
[2:01:41.760 --> 2:01:46.880]  oftentimes ask me why do the elite killed you these things well there's only two of them
[2:01:46.880 --> 2:01:51.760]  there's not others that have been willing to confide in me and i think the reason that doing it is
[2:01:51.760 --> 2:01:57.120]  because years ago i was willing to give three years of my life to be their chaplain and that's
[2:01:57.120 --> 2:02:01.600]  the reason they're telling me some very startling things now you you have never heard me say this
[2:02:01.600 --> 2:02:09.280]  before i actually recorded the words of some of the elite and that's what people i actually
[2:02:09.280 --> 2:02:16.480]  recorded them when we were together i actually recorded them now i know people have had trouble
[2:02:16.480 --> 2:02:20.880]  believing some of the things i've said over the years but then what the elite have told me has
[2:02:20.880 --> 2:02:26.480]  taken place that way every single time so if you have any doubts whatsoever about believing
[2:02:26.480 --> 2:02:32.400]  lindsay williams don't believe me i'm just by the providence of god the spooky person that
[2:02:32.400 --> 2:02:40.000]  that is allowed to give this information out then you will be able to hear the voices of them themselves
[2:02:40.000 --> 2:02:45.680]  incredible so you're breaking this here first time this has ever been told alex i have never
[2:02:45.680 --> 2:02:51.920]  said this on any radio show anywhere in the world i said to your producer when he called me two or
[2:02:51.920 --> 2:02:57.520]  three days ago i said i want to give this for the first time on the alex show because i know you've
[2:02:57.520 --> 2:03:02.560]  got so much coverage i must get this information so is this stuff you recorded back in the 70s
[2:03:02.560 --> 2:03:08.400]  and 80s or is this new stuff well some of it is new some of it is back then some of it goes back
[2:03:08.400 --> 2:03:16.160]  two years ago some of it is up to right now and then also what they're going to do i'm actually
[2:03:16.160 --> 2:03:20.880]  going to give you you will hear their words as to what they're going to do and you'll hear the
[2:03:20.880 --> 2:03:27.040]  words of their spokesperson telling what they're going to do and i was told to listen to these
[2:03:27.040 --> 2:03:33.600]  things because in them i would find the buzz words now keep in mind well the first things that i
[2:03:33.600 --> 2:03:40.320]  learned when i lived with the elite of the world was to listen to that buzz words and i found i
[2:03:40.320 --> 2:03:45.440]  wrote three books about this and i said they have a code of ethics and in their code of ethics
[2:03:46.320 --> 2:03:50.320]  and they don't have the same code of ethics you and i have they don't have the bible they don't
[2:03:50.320 --> 2:03:55.440]  believe the word of god they don't trust jesus christ to save you but they have a code of ethics
[2:03:55.440 --> 2:03:59.840]  and that code of ethics says that they must tell you what they're going to do before they do it
[2:03:59.840 --> 2:04:05.600]  and i have been told to listen to certain buzz words that they were giving and i know we're
[2:04:05.600 --> 2:04:10.000]  coming up on a break here so i found the next okay so what you're saying we give you some of that
[2:04:10.000 --> 2:04:15.120]  buzz words okay but i want to go back and and and and recap where the well prices are going
[2:04:15.120 --> 2:04:18.960]  the other intel that mr. from gave you that you were allowed to get out after he passed
[2:04:18.960 --> 2:04:23.760]  and then i want to get into the specifics of you're saying two to three weeks they told you
[2:04:23.760 --> 2:04:27.680]  when the euro goes down i want to talk about when it's going down i want to talk about
[2:04:29.760 --> 2:04:34.080]  what they mean by you got two to three weeks two three weeks till total collapse bank shutdown
[2:04:34.080 --> 2:04:37.760]  i mean let's get specifics on this long statement coming up plenty of time lensing
[2:04:37.760 --> 2:04:41.760]  and then did i mean did you record these guys do you have their authorization or did they tell you
[2:04:41.760 --> 2:04:46.080]  go out and find this press release that's where it's been admitted in plain view i know that's one
[2:04:46.080 --> 2:04:50.960]  of their favorite little tricks it's like one of their rules this is all breaking i i just
[2:04:52.720 --> 2:04:56.640]  knew that mr. from was about to die of cancer and then he and then we called and he has died

[2:08:07.680 --> 2:08:24.240]  a war on for your mind
[2:08:24.240 --> 2:08:33.360]  lindsay williams the biggest data dump i've ever gotten from him and just thank god for him
[2:08:34.160 --> 2:08:40.240]  pastor williams again 20 plus years ago wrote a book the energy non crisis laying out how there
[2:08:40.240 --> 2:08:46.080]  were more oil reserves that have been discovered in alaska much of its sweet crude than all the
[2:08:46.080 --> 2:08:50.720]  saudi arabia but we're not allowed to have it they could have dozens of pipelines coming down
[2:08:50.720 --> 2:08:57.280]  our gas will be incredibly cheap but it's a rigged system and that has now all come out mainstream
[2:08:57.280 --> 2:09:02.800]  news making you know really his original stuff passe but people couldn't believe it 25 years ago
[2:09:03.520 --> 2:09:11.040]  now mr fromm i knew that dr monteef loves to dig around and he figured out who he was called him
[2:09:11.840 --> 2:09:16.000]  he figured out who the other guy was i'd figured it out it was all hidden in plain view
[2:09:16.000 --> 2:09:21.600]  and so i knew williams was telling the truth and people here and they're like this can't be true
[2:09:21.600 --> 2:09:26.080]  that you know that the leader actually talking to each other and know what's coming know what's
[2:09:26.080 --> 2:09:32.640]  going to happen folks i don't know any billionaires i've i've met a few and and and a billionaire
[2:09:32.640 --> 2:09:38.880]  i ran into through a another person i know and then afterwards after i've met with her i looked
[2:09:38.880 --> 2:09:43.280]  her up online and found that it was all i was just blown away this is one of the richest women in
[2:09:43.280 --> 2:09:50.480]  the united states which i didn't live her now and she said this was this was about three years ago
[2:09:50.480 --> 2:09:56.080]  three and a half years ago and she said in three years so i guess she's a little behind on the time
[2:09:56.080 --> 2:10:01.040]  there won't be a united states and i said what does that mean she just said i'm getting out of here
[2:10:02.800 --> 2:10:07.760]  and she said you'll see then i'm out in the hill country at an event with some people that my kids
[2:10:07.760 --> 2:10:13.280]  are friends with and there's john wanes uh you know you know one of his kids living out there and
[2:10:13.280 --> 2:10:18.720]  they're like uh you know and i went and looked him up later and it is one of john wanes kids
[2:10:18.720 --> 2:10:24.720]  i'm leaving i'm leaving the country you know because of all these new rules i mean they all know
[2:10:24.720 --> 2:10:32.240]  folks they all know what's going on every time i run into some elitist or wealthy person they're
[2:10:32.240 --> 2:10:38.640]  like either laughing at everybody or like abandon ship because they have well let's go to lindsay

[2:10:43.920 --> 2:10:49.520]  much to tell let's go through through it piece by piece your other mr rex not ken from but the other
[2:10:49.520 --> 2:10:54.480]  mr rex it was even more high level than him he told you specifically what about the euro
[2:10:54.480 --> 2:10:58.720]  collapsed did he give you time frames and then you got cut off by the break you said you'll only
[2:10:58.720 --> 2:11:06.560]  have two or three weeks to get out what does that mean quantify that question okay the again let me
[2:11:06.560 --> 2:11:11.520]  say that only by the providence of god could i have never known any of these things don't give
[2:11:11.520 --> 2:11:18.160]  lindsay williams credit for this all right he said to me the other day he said lindsay i want to
[2:11:18.160 --> 2:11:22.480]  show you how to listen to some buzzwords and i'm going to give them to you right now
[2:11:22.480 --> 2:11:28.880]  alec wants me to give them quick i'll try my best to do it uh i want to train you i want to teach you
[2:11:28.880 --> 2:11:36.160]  right now how to listen to the buzzwords of the elite uh he gave me a few of them and he said you
[2:11:36.160 --> 2:11:40.720]  listen to these and then figure it out for yourself here's one right here you probably saw it in the
[2:11:40.720 --> 2:11:46.240]  national media he told me to listen to it the international monetary fund it was only a few
[2:11:46.240 --> 2:11:51.360]  days ago that they said now now pick out the buzzwords and then i'll give them to you and
[2:11:51.360 --> 2:11:57.920]  explain them he said 15 major developing country governments including the us japan and the uk
[2:11:57.920 --> 2:12:05.440]  spain and greece must raise 10.2 trillion and that's correct you did not hear me say million or
[2:12:05.440 --> 2:12:13.520]  billion said they must raise 10.2 trillion dollars to repay nothing but the interest interest only
[2:12:14.080 --> 2:12:19.440]  on the indebtedness of these countries and then he said to me he said can they do that
[2:12:19.440 --> 2:12:26.960]  that and i said i said it's a total impossibility he said now listen to the rest of this he said
[2:12:26.960 --> 2:12:33.520]  this 10.2 trillion that they must raise in order to pay the interest just on the debt alone is 27
[2:12:33.520 --> 2:12:40.960]  percent of their combined annual economic output he said chaplain you cannot repay that he said
[2:12:40.960 --> 2:12:47.280]  all right now he's training me to listen and i did this years ago i trained myself to listen to
[2:12:47.280 --> 2:12:51.840]  their buzzwords but he's kind of helping me understand their very latest buzzwords and
[2:12:51.840 --> 2:12:57.520]  i'm trying to help you understand them okay now he said if this can't be done then what are they
[2:12:57.520 --> 2:13:02.720]  going to do about that debt i said they can't pay it he said that's right he said then what happens
[2:13:02.720 --> 2:13:08.960]  to the currency of the unit of the united states and japan and the uk and spain and greece i said
[2:13:08.960 --> 2:13:14.800]  it it's got to collect he said do you now you're getting the message he said we told you all the
[2:13:14.800 --> 2:13:19.520]  time what was going to happen but he said the average american hasn't got sense enough to
[2:13:19.520 --> 2:13:24.800]  understand what we're trying to say let me give you some more buzzwords take the comic silver
[2:13:24.800 --> 2:13:30.000]  exchange he said listen to what they told you last week are you ready now you know what the
[2:13:30.000 --> 2:13:36.080]  comic silver exchange is they're the ones that hold the silver in their vaults for the richest
[2:13:36.080 --> 2:13:43.200]  people on the face of the earth the people in china in japan and russia and wealthy people of the world
[2:13:43.200 --> 2:13:48.960]  and then they give them a piece of paper saying we are holding this silver for you now you said the
[2:13:48.960 --> 2:13:55.440]  comic silver exchange announced just the other day that they have a hundred and seven million
[2:13:55.440 --> 2:14:02.640]  ounces of silver on hand uh you folks you're listening they've got a hundred seven million
[2:14:02.640 --> 2:14:12.320]  ounces of silver on hand but they have contractual obligations in the amount of 720 million ounces
[2:14:12.320 --> 2:14:18.960]  of silver that they've given out pieces of paper saying we have this on hand and we can deliver it
[2:14:18.960 --> 2:14:26.640]  to you upon your request now he said chaplain whenever they the people start to ask for delivery
[2:14:26.640 --> 2:14:33.280]  of that physical silver he said what is going to happen to the price of silver he said mr from told
[2:14:33.280 --> 2:14:39.920]  you back about a year or two ago that the only thing you could spare your assets in this silver
[2:14:39.920 --> 2:14:44.400]  and gold i don't sell silver and gold you listen to alex jones he'll tell you what to go and buy
[2:14:44.400 --> 2:14:51.120]  that i'm just trying to tell you that they told me two years ago chaplain there's only one way
[2:14:51.120 --> 2:14:56.000]  you're going to spare your assets and that's silver and gold the price is going so high most
[2:14:56.000 --> 2:15:00.240]  people can't buy it but i want you back when you could get it for six and seven hundred dollars of
[2:15:00.240 --> 2:15:04.800]  ounce that you ought to buy it immediately well let me go back let's see let me go back i mean
[2:15:04.800 --> 2:15:09.440]  people say to me well why are you promoting silver and gold and i've had national media ask me that
[2:15:09.440 --> 2:15:16.880]  and i look at them like they're crazy and i say i was promoting gold when it was 300 dollars an ounce
[2:15:17.760 --> 2:15:22.240]  i was promoting silver when it was five dollars an ounce because i knew they were devaluing the
[2:15:22.240 --> 2:15:28.640]  currency and it would come to a head and that they got rid of glass stegel i mean it'd be kind of like
[2:15:28.640 --> 2:15:35.040]  if i moved to a resort town in colorada and set up a canoe shop by a river well why did you set up a
[2:15:35.040 --> 2:15:42.240]  canoe shop because there's tourists around here i mean i mean it's like the the george soros media
[2:15:42.240 --> 2:15:49.360]  they make it like bad to promote silver and gold when it's like common sense i mean it's it's it's
[2:15:49.360 --> 2:15:56.080]  just crazy that i believe in silver and gold i've got guns i've got storable food i've got water
[2:15:56.080 --> 2:16:01.120]  filters i'm trying to move right now to the countryside i'll just be honest with folks
[2:16:01.120 --> 2:16:05.760]  it's better than just leaving the country uh everyone people i know that are smart have moved
[2:16:05.760 --> 2:16:10.960]  out of austin far out in the country and people that are smarter getting ready because let me tell
[2:16:10.960 --> 2:16:15.360]  you when they tell you the economy is going to turn around it's a lie ladies and gentlemen
[2:16:15.360 --> 2:16:20.800]  they've designed this they're just stalling you long enough so they can make sure they're all
[2:16:20.800 --> 2:16:26.560]  prepared and got their grid in place i'm sorry lindsay it's just it's just my job is easy i'm

[2:16:37.840 --> 2:16:44.880]  up with these elite and i have made a survey as to where the elite live uh where did mr prom live
[2:16:44.880 --> 2:16:50.560]  he lived in the middle of nowhere he lived the way out in a little polka place called salt on
[2:16:50.560 --> 2:16:55.760]  alaska before he died he moved to the middle of nowhere where there's this other mr x of my book
[2:16:55.760 --> 2:17:01.760]  in it you know i christ is live he lives back further than what mr prom lived now what is swartzman
[2:17:01.760 --> 2:17:09.600]  of the black stone group which is the he is probably the biggest financier of financial
[2:17:09.600 --> 2:17:14.080]  instruments in the united states of america he said last week he said i'm leaving the country now
[2:17:14.080 --> 2:17:18.000]  i'm not leaving the country i would you not leave in the country wait that's a bombshell he told
[2:17:18.000 --> 2:17:23.760]  you he's leaving the country himself well yeah but you and i're not leaving the country we're
[2:17:23.760 --> 2:17:28.000]  staying here uh we're going to fight this thing out and see it through and i want to continue
[2:17:28.000 --> 2:17:32.720]  to be able to be here to get information from these people and to give it out to you on the
[2:17:32.720 --> 2:17:37.200]  alex joneshow and every place i could possibly give it in order to help spirit listen i don't know
[2:17:37.200 --> 2:17:42.160]  how long we're going to be here the stuff going on behind the scenes is just i'm glad you're moving
[2:17:42.160 --> 2:17:46.400]  out though alex moving out to the country moving out in the wide open spaces i did the same thing
[2:17:46.400 --> 2:17:51.760]  i live in the middle of nowhere and you've got to you've got to make preparations right now
[2:17:51.760 --> 2:17:56.800]  okay let me go back to their buzzwords again because this fits right in with the european union
[2:17:57.360 --> 2:18:03.840]  and i'm not playing games i just want to teach you how to listen to the buzzwords of the elite
[2:18:03.840 --> 2:18:07.920]  so you can do this for yourself because i only have the privilege of being on alex joneshow
[2:18:07.920 --> 2:18:14.880]  maybe we want a month or two but okay european union the euro european union's going to have a
[2:18:14.880 --> 2:18:20.240]  major problem i've already been told that the euro will collapse before the american dollar
[2:18:20.240 --> 2:18:25.520]  and whatever it does you have two to three weeks to get out of paper do you remember what i told you
[2:18:25.520 --> 2:18:30.320]  that mr prom said to me back about two years ago he said chaplain if it's written on a piece of
[2:18:30.320 --> 2:18:36.400]  paper it's worth the paper it's written on he said get out of anything that is paper now do you
[2:18:36.400 --> 2:18:43.840]  realize what that means that means get out off your ira's get out of your 401ks get out of your
[2:18:43.840 --> 2:18:49.600]  retirement funds cash in at any cost i don't care what it may be you're going to lose them anyway
[2:18:49.600 --> 2:18:55.040]  if you don't your social security you cannot depend on it i know you've got it right now
[2:18:55.040 --> 2:18:59.120]  but you're not going to be able to depend on it for that long you think your insurance policy is
[2:18:59.120 --> 2:19:05.600]  going to be worth anything whenever paper becomes worthless and what is it that you and i use every
[2:19:05.600 --> 2:19:13.440]  day we use the federal reserve vote and i have been told that when you see the euro collapse you
[2:19:13.440 --> 2:19:18.880]  have two to three weeks to get out of every piece of paper you've got including your bank account
[2:19:18.880 --> 2:19:23.440]  if you don't you're going to lose it alex i don't know how any planer i can put it
[2:19:23.440 --> 2:19:28.720]  and they've said to me okay the other day one of them said to me he said the federal reserve is
[2:19:28.720 --> 2:19:35.040]  borrowing one hundred billion dollars every 30 days does this scare you you know to scare the
[2:19:35.040 --> 2:19:42.320]  pants off of you and and mr prom told me two years ago and i said it over your program alex
[2:19:42.320 --> 2:19:47.840]  and that was before the federal reserve started buying their own debt he said to me chaplain
[2:19:47.840 --> 2:19:54.720]  whenever the federal reserve begins to buy their own debt he said it's practically all over now the
[2:19:54.720 --> 2:19:59.680]  federal reserve is buying their own debt because china and japan and other countries aren't buying
[2:19:59.680 --> 2:20:07.040]  it like they did before and last week the federal reserve borrowed one hundred billion dollars every
[2:20:07.040 --> 2:20:13.600]  30 days and by the way that's only qe2 they've now announced qe3 they're going to start borrowing
[2:20:13.600 --> 2:20:24.400]  200 to 250 bill a month yes and where where is the where's the 10-year note now most people
[2:20:24.400 --> 2:20:29.440]  are not necessarily financially minded but they're dumping treasuries all over the world russia and
[2:20:29.440 --> 2:20:34.080]  china two weeks ago announced that they were going to stop using the dollar between trade
[2:20:34.080 --> 2:20:39.200]  now they have officially in fact that's in my stack i didn't get to it today russia to use china
[2:20:39.200 --> 2:20:44.400]  currency so we were wondering what it would be it's going to be the chinese currency for all
[2:20:44.400 --> 2:20:50.400]  their trade between each other which is massive they border each other i mean it's happening
[2:20:52.160 --> 2:20:57.920]  i'm sorry i'm interrupting you did your source the former ceo not mr rex the other
[2:20:58.720 --> 2:21:04.320]  atlantic richfield a former head did he say what the time frame was he said the time frame
[2:21:04.320 --> 2:21:10.400]  on oil a month ago and suddenly it's gone up 15 20 bucks since then and racing up uh did he say
[2:21:10.400 --> 2:21:16.640]  the time frame on the euro default he did not say when the euro is going to collapse email
[2:21:16.640 --> 2:21:22.320]  he said it's going to uh he said let this be assigned to you whatever it happens he said you've
[2:21:22.320 --> 2:21:26.880]  got two to three weeks to make some very definite preparations if you haven't already done it now
[2:21:26.880 --> 2:21:31.920]  many things that in your life you will begin to need to make those preparations right now because
[2:21:31.920 --> 2:21:37.760]  for instance you can't get out of your ira in two weeks if they just totally well let's see here's
[2:21:37.760 --> 2:21:43.120]  an example with yours truly all the money almost all the money i've got is just sitting there in a
[2:21:43.120 --> 2:21:50.960]  bank to run this this operation because it costs so much to run it you know it takes i mean it takes
[2:21:50.960 --> 2:21:56.240]  a million dollars to run it for six months anybody who's got employees and buildings and payroll and
[2:21:56.240 --> 2:22:00.880]  taxes and insurance knows that so we don't have a you know a big reserve but we've got something
[2:22:00.880 --> 2:22:07.840]  because our mission so i mean what do i even do with that that's what's so crazy about this situation
[2:22:07.840 --> 2:22:14.320]  is i have to leave it in the bank to pay the bills and run the operation so i guess it makes my
[2:22:14.320 --> 2:22:21.360]  head hurt lindsay well yes it does it'll make your head spin and those are things that we all
[2:22:21.360 --> 2:22:25.840]  need to think about in advance now why am i saying this and why does alex say these things
[2:22:25.840 --> 2:22:32.240]  day after day i'm not saying this to scare you quite to the contrary i want you to prepare
[2:22:32.240 --> 2:22:37.280]  and spare yourself heartache and save your dinner table that's the only reason i'm telling you these
[2:22:37.280 --> 2:22:43.280]  things not to keep you awake at night but to make preparations right now because if you prepare for
[2:22:43.280 --> 2:22:48.720]  the inevitable then when it does happen there'll be very little effect on you while the rest of
[2:22:48.720 --> 2:22:52.960]  the world is totally collapsing around you well lindsay you're absolutely right people say oh the
[2:22:52.960 --> 2:22:57.920]  government fear mongers alex you fear monger the government fear mongers about boogie men with
[2:22:57.920 --> 2:23:03.360]  turbines on their head and we all know 911 was an inside job used to set up the police state grid
[2:23:03.360 --> 2:23:07.840]  anybody in denial about that is starting to wake up as they admit it's for the american people
[2:23:08.480 --> 2:23:15.040]  i'm saying be concerned about dollar devaluation be concerned about globalism be concerned about
[2:23:15.040 --> 2:23:23.040]  carbon taxes and it's all happening now california has got over 30 on employment even 60 minutes
[2:23:23.040 --> 2:23:28.960]  admits that and what do they do lindsay they slapped a carbon tax at 20 on them they want to
[2:23:28.960 --> 2:23:36.640]  run that economy down on the ground the elite won't america to collapse i have been told this
[2:23:36.640 --> 2:23:43.440]  and you say why would they want to collapse their own economy their own country very simple
[2:23:43.440 --> 2:23:50.880]  you never buy something when it's at its peak and making great money instead you bankrupt it get it
[2:23:50.880 --> 2:23:57.360]  on pennies on the dollar just like they did christlyn and gm general motives they waited until they
[2:23:57.360 --> 2:24:02.560]  first collapsed them then they took them over at taxpayers expense through the federal reserve
[2:24:02.560 --> 2:24:06.880]  because the federal reserve is no more federal than federal express and the federal reserve
[2:24:06.880 --> 2:24:12.720]  basically are the elite and some others along with them now if whatever you collapse these
[2:24:12.720 --> 2:24:16.480]  corporations then you can take them over for nothing that's what they're going to do with
[2:24:16.480 --> 2:24:22.720]  the mortgage back securities and your house uh payment yeah first they sell it though first
[2:24:22.720 --> 2:24:28.560]  they sell it when it's all hot as hotcakes up front to everybody then when it implodes they
[2:24:28.560 --> 2:24:34.000]  go give us bailouts to fix it and they keep the bailout money and the derivatives are still there
[2:24:34.000 --> 2:24:38.960]  then they say give us more bailout money will fix it then they don't then everything implodes
[2:24:38.960 --> 2:24:42.800]  they're flush with all the money they come in and buy it all up for pennies on the dollar
[2:24:42.800 --> 2:24:49.200]  and if you don't like it they got the national guard the cia the fbi and paramilitary squads
[2:24:49.200 --> 2:24:54.560]  ready to come and take you out i mean they've set this whole thing up they did set it up and i
[2:24:54.560 --> 2:24:59.920]  was told this for the past 35 years what they were doing alex and i've had the privilege of
[2:24:59.920 --> 2:25:04.400]  from time to time being on your show and telling people this was going to happen and i wasn't doing
[2:25:04.400 --> 2:25:10.720]  it to scare you i was doing it because the elite told me this and every single thing both please
[2:25:10.720 --> 2:25:17.120]  every single thing you're hearing alex jones say is the truth you've got to listen to him every day
[2:25:17.120 --> 2:25:24.400]  and take to heart what he's saying now mr prom told me two years uh i'm sorry a year and a half
[2:25:24.400 --> 2:25:29.600]  ago you ready yes give you the expressions again i've given them a pull but i think you must hear
[2:25:29.600 --> 2:25:38.160]  these again he said within two years you will not recognize america well folks you better believe
[2:25:38.160 --> 2:25:44.560]  that we already beginning to see that take place again he said after two years you will be so poor
[2:25:44.560 --> 2:25:50.480]  i couldn't understand a year to a year and a half ago why this man was saying this he said within
[2:25:50.480 --> 2:25:56.640]  two years you will be so poor you will not be able to do anything about it folks if we want to turn
[2:25:56.640 --> 2:26:04.560]  america around we've got to have massive move but immediately and it can be done believe it can be
[2:26:04.560 --> 2:26:10.800]  done he said again one day uh he said by 2012 the dollar will be dead well they may have
[2:26:10.800 --> 2:26:16.720]  accomplished that a little bit before 2012 at the rate they're going to euro it looks will have that
[2:26:16.720 --> 2:26:21.520]  happen before 20 now even wall street journal and der spiegel are saying the euro could go belly up
[2:26:21.520 --> 2:26:28.000]  anytime well i don't think you're going to see it this week or next week uh from what i was told
[2:26:28.000 --> 2:26:33.120]  by the other gentleman when mr prom passed away they're going to suck all the little countries dry
[2:26:33.120 --> 2:26:39.520]  first in the name of propping it up and then bring down germany france and england yes they are and
[2:26:39.520 --> 2:26:43.200]  you're seeing some things happen in england you said you were going to get on the program yet
[2:26:43.200 --> 2:26:49.600]  today so watch these things because these are buzzwords again he said to me he back about a
[2:26:49.600 --> 2:26:55.440]  year year and a half ago he said within two years nearly everyone will be working for the government
[2:26:55.440 --> 2:27:01.680]  could we have possibly imagined general motors and christina and the banks being taken over nine to
[2:27:01.680 --> 2:27:06.880]  ten of them almost every week the health care program bringing every doctor dentist that
[2:27:06.880 --> 2:27:12.240]  everybody in as employees for the government of united states of america we could not have imagined
[2:27:12.240 --> 2:27:17.680]  this at the time of this this man told me this but it's taking place today exactly like he told
[2:27:17.680 --> 2:27:23.600]  me it would happen now he's saying that things are going to happen in europe and whatever they
[2:27:23.600 --> 2:27:28.160]  happen you've got two to three weeks if you haven't already made certain preparation and then alex
[2:27:28.160 --> 2:27:34.160]  he told me something else recently call this oh you just give us the new intel what you couldn't
[2:27:34.160 --> 2:27:41.040]  tell us until he'd passed from cancer tell us the new intel well first of all devils messiah i know
[2:27:41.040 --> 2:27:46.080]  that this might seem insignificant to some but it's very important to me having been a minister
[2:27:46.080 --> 2:27:50.160]  of the gospel for over 50 years that's what they call it they call it devils messiah what is it
[2:27:50.720 --> 2:27:56.240]  yeah the devil's messiah is that plan whereby they could bring in the new war order in america
[2:27:56.240 --> 2:28:01.280]  and they knew that there was no way that they could do it until they first removed the god
[2:28:01.280 --> 2:28:06.400]  and the foundation upon which america was built and in order to bring that about they had to bring
[2:28:06.400 --> 2:28:12.800]  in the evolution they had to bring in uh control of churches by 501 c three organizations yeah even
[2:28:12.800 --> 2:28:17.600]  if you're not a christian you have to understand social engineers have to get rid of the old order
[2:28:17.600 --> 2:28:22.800]  to bring in the new so they've they've dumbed us down they've taught us to not have morals
[2:28:22.800 --> 2:28:28.400]  so we couldn't recognize tyranny and resist it let me give you an example that this was just
[2:28:28.400 --> 2:28:33.520]  first startling the other day the european union do you remember when the european union was first
[2:28:33.520 --> 2:28:40.080]  set up and so many bible teachers and ministers all over the country said the european union is the
[2:28:40.080 --> 2:28:47.440]  10to kingdom of the book of daniel and we finally have all of these prophetic scriptures of the
[2:28:47.440 --> 2:28:56.240]  book of revelation by the 10 nations formation in europe no way this was deception they were trying
[2:28:56.240 --> 2:29:01.360]  to make fools out of the ministers of america i didn't know it at the time i even used to talk
[2:29:01.360 --> 2:29:06.800]  about this and then it went up to 11 nations and 12 nations and 13 nations it went past 10
[2:29:06.800 --> 2:29:11.360]  and totally embarrassed some of the biggest bible scholars in early study the bible it says
[2:29:11.360 --> 2:29:15.600]  there's many antichrists there's models of it building i mean the globalist always
[2:29:16.320 --> 2:29:21.360]  going back thousands of years the alumnus they build similar models towards their final system
[2:29:22.640 --> 2:29:28.560]  you know and they had this devil's devil's messiah as it was actually called the visual
[2:29:28.560 --> 2:29:34.960]  is exact words that the man used he said devil's messiah and part of it i found out was this european
[2:29:34.960 --> 2:29:40.640]  union sure it's all set up by the elitists but they didn't they didn't stop at 10 toes as daniel
[2:29:40.640 --> 2:29:46.400]  talks about in his image stay there when we come back give us all the deception lindsay stay there
[2:29:46.400 --> 2:29:49.920]  when we come back tell us all the other things he told you we'll be right back stay with us

[2:43:20.880 --> 2:43:26.880]  i mean it what is the devil messiah just the total spiritual takeover the devil's messiah is
[2:43:26.880 --> 2:43:32.240]  their method and the latest one that was given to me was the european union and the fact of the
[2:43:32.240 --> 2:43:39.120]  ten toes and it they embarrassed so many ministers i mean big name to cross america who said this was
[2:43:39.120 --> 2:43:44.640]  the fulfillment of the book of daniel and revelation and all the world they were doing was
[2:43:44.640 --> 2:43:50.160]  an intentional program of embarrassment of the ministers of america another expression that we
[2:43:50.160 --> 2:43:55.040]  used him recently he said the elite planned on everything in america well you can readily
[2:43:55.040 --> 2:44:01.120]  understand how this can be if we bail out the mortgage back security problem and the elite
[2:44:01.120 --> 2:44:07.920]  takeover every uh piece of mortgage real estate in america whether it commercial or residential
[2:44:07.920 --> 2:44:12.800]  and you'll be making your payment to the federal reserve you'll see this happen shortly again i can't
[2:44:12.800 --> 2:44:19.840]  stress enough to you folks i plead with you get every piece of gold and so you can get your hands
[2:44:19.840 --> 2:44:26.240]  on you haven't seen anything yet if you think gold at fourteen hundred dollars an ounce is high
[2:44:26.240 --> 2:44:29.920]  what are you going to say when there's a three thousand dollars an hour let's continue what are
[2:44:29.920 --> 2:44:34.720]  the other bullet points people need to know okay gasoline we already three dollars a gallon in
[2:44:34.720 --> 2:44:39.360]  Phoenix arizona you're going to go to four dollars a gallon as quick as they can get it there again
[2:44:39.360 --> 2:44:47.760]  russia and china this is america's greatest threat before mr dot mr from died he went into details
[2:44:47.760 --> 2:44:52.640]  on this with me and i planned to make an entire presentation just of this sometimes in the future
[2:44:52.640 --> 2:45:01.040]  he said china is the big ones again and it leads to knows how to be cured of cancer mr from wouldn't
[2:45:01.040 --> 2:45:06.720]  go that route because he had a son who was a medical doctor he convinced him uh to take the okay so
[2:45:06.720 --> 2:45:11.840]  that's another issue what else what else was there that you couldn't tell folks uh that you can now
[2:45:11.840 --> 2:45:19.360]  tell them okay this basically all the the both of the points but the buzzwords are what are so
[2:45:19.360 --> 2:45:27.760]  important because they tell you everything of what the elite are going to do and because of that i
[2:45:27.760 --> 2:45:35.680]  have uh i have listed 12 things that you positively must do immediately in order to spare yourself in
[2:45:35.680 --> 2:45:41.760]  light of what these people have told me uh you've got to watch inside of trading oh my goodness people
[2:45:41.760 --> 2:45:46.720]  have you seen what's been happening there in the last few days of how inside of trading is going up
[2:45:46.720 --> 2:45:53.920]  so it's the elite the ceo's the corporate heads they know what's coming and as a result inside of
[2:45:53.920 --> 2:46:01.120]  trading has just gone to uh unbelievable heights the very latest one that was recorded here was
[2:46:01.120 --> 2:46:08.800]  november the 15th through the 19th inside of trading went to 8281 do you realize if the ceo's
[2:46:08.800 --> 2:46:13.520]  and the corporate heads are bailing out because they know what mr prom told me back a year or two
[2:46:13.520 --> 2:46:17.840]  ago and they're just beginning to see it and they're cashing out for everything they're worth
[2:46:17.840 --> 2:46:23.120]  but yet you'll you'll uh broker will still try to get you into the new york stock market
[2:46:23.680 --> 2:46:29.440]  it's why that's right and and and and lindsey again this is important what because you know
[2:46:29.440 --> 2:46:33.840]  think there's so many points we're moving fast here uh what else because you said there was a lot
[2:46:33.840 --> 2:46:39.920]  of stuff what else uh did uh ken from tell you that you couldn't talk about until he was dead and
[2:46:39.920 --> 2:46:46.640]  buried okay i'll give you a few pointers and each one of these could i could at least take an hour
[2:46:46.640 --> 2:46:54.800]  on the arab world he went into depth into the muslims jihad and the united arab imprints in
[2:46:54.800 --> 2:47:00.960]  saudi arabia again he has gone into depth with me in link the confidence what is he saying bravely
[2:47:00.960 --> 2:47:05.040]  is going to happen there and we'll have you back soon but what did he say briefly that's going to
[2:47:05.040 --> 2:47:12.640]  happen there uh in in where now in the arab world what was the big key thing there well of course
[2:47:12.640 --> 2:47:17.360]  they brought the price of crude oil down and he told me why they did that and it was in order to
[2:47:17.360 --> 2:47:22.320]  put some of these countries into a certain position where they wanted them and now of course they
[2:47:22.320 --> 2:47:27.280]  lowered the value of the dollar to the point that even though they made yet a hundred two hundred
[2:47:27.280 --> 2:47:31.760]  fifty dollars a barrel for their oil they're still getting in purchasing power as far as the
[2:47:31.760 --> 2:47:36.480]  american dollar which they're locked into and they can't get out of it russia and china can get out
[2:47:36.480 --> 2:47:42.960]  of use of the american dollar for saudi arabia the uh and the um those countries over there they
[2:47:42.960 --> 2:47:47.200]  can't get out of this because they were locked into it according to henry kissinger back many years
[2:47:47.200 --> 2:47:51.680]  ago and the agreement that he made with him so as a result even though they may get a hundred and
[2:47:51.680 --> 2:47:56.720]  fifty dollars a barrel for their oil they'll still only be getting about fifty dollars in purchasing
[2:47:56.720 --> 2:48:03.440]  power of the american dollar i mean this is so startling to understand the inside workings of
[2:48:03.440 --> 2:48:10.080]  all of this as to how they're doing it amazing any other bullet points well yes he's going into
[2:48:10.080 --> 2:48:17.680]  iran iraq in afghanistan uh he made it very plain that why we in afghanistan and the agreement
[2:48:17.680 --> 2:48:24.320]  that was made by henry kissinger was uh back in years ago and iran and iraq wouldn't go along with it
[2:48:24.320 --> 2:48:30.320]  and as a result of it was intentionally done that we went in there did what we did to iraq we
[2:48:30.320 --> 2:48:39.840]  just haven't been able to do it to iran yet uh let's see he's going into into depth about the
[2:48:39.840 --> 2:48:46.720]  world order and george herbert bush daddy bush again he's going into depth about the devil's
[2:48:46.720 --> 2:48:52.000]  messiah again he went into some depth with me about america and the elitist and their most
[2:48:52.000 --> 2:48:57.600]  difficult challenge which is the united states of america surprising how much trouble they've had
[2:48:57.600 --> 2:49:03.360]  with america and with our presidents and of course they i know that uh well anyway i won't go into
[2:49:03.360 --> 2:49:09.600]  this president president because that's uh subject within itself gaul island the audit wildlife refuge
[2:49:09.600 --> 2:49:15.760]  the back and reserve and how that we would not have to take one drop of oil from any foreign
[2:49:15.760 --> 2:49:21.040]  country if we would just use what's on our own soil and of course he was the one that gave me the
[2:49:21.040 --> 2:49:26.320]  information in my book energy not prices lindsay i want to stop you there and come back this will
[2:49:26.320 --> 2:49:29.600]  lindsay i want to sorry and then stop you there and come back in the final segment
[2:49:29.600 --> 2:49:36.000]  and and get into more of what the other mr x has told you but briefly here um i know we

[2:57:09.520 --> 2:57:15.840]  9 11 or or a vent to try to curtail free speech i mean i remember two years ago you said the media
[2:57:15.840 --> 2:57:20.560]  would be the last thing to go they would crash the economy and then shut the media down did they
