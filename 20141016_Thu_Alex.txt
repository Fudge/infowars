[00:56.800 --> 01:03.760]  basically talking about a call that they're on we have Obama saying there's nothing to
[01:03.760 --> 01:10.400]  fear that it's a low probability that an epidemic will start in the US even as we
[01:10.400 --> 01:16.600]  learn that the second nurse to contract Ebola traveled all over the place on aircraft and
[01:16.600 --> 01:22.720]  that the plane was not even cleaned that is wiped down they picked up the trash on the
[01:22.720 --> 01:30.200]  floor but not a deep clean for five more flights after she was on it five more flights
[01:30.200 --> 01:37.200]  meanwhile Central and South American countries have announced today that they are going to
[01:37.200 --> 01:43.720]  cease flights from West Africa into their countries months after Europe did this and the Middle
[01:43.720 --> 01:52.680]  East did it and still the US is not just allowing the flights in but issuing visas to whoever
[01:52.680 --> 02:01.840]  wants them to come rubber stamping them so we have more countries issuing travel bands
[02:01.840 --> 02:11.640]  on Ebola stricken nations like Columbia and different Caribbean islands like St. Luke
[02:11.640 --> 02:25.080]  that I pronounced that St. Lucia but not the United States we are the Ebola vomit bag the

[10:00.720 --> 10:07.720]  economic front on the second amendment front on the police state front with houston literally
[10:08.720 --> 10:15.720]  trying to intimidate churches and to not giving sermons that criticize transsexual behavior
[10:15.720 --> 10:21.720]  or homosexuality and a lot of libertarian groups have been coming out and even though they are
[10:22.720 --> 10:28.720]  open to other lifestyles the libertarians they are defending these preachers because if
[10:28.720 --> 10:32.720]  you're going to have your right to live the way you want somebody else has to have their
[10:32.720 --> 10:43.720]  right to live and speak as they see fit flaming authoritarianism pun intended out of the houston
[10:43.720 --> 10:52.720]  mayor and the rest of them suing churches this is what europe and canada are doing this is the
[10:52.720 --> 10:57.720]  model everything you see with political correctness out of europe and canada is coming here they
[10:57.720 --> 11:04.720]  arrest preachers that criticize homosexuality and to control language in england they arrested
[11:04.720 --> 11:10.720]  robin page who wasn't even a critic of the you know gay lobby a decade ago when he gave a
[11:10.720 --> 11:15.720]  speech saying rural communities deserve the same rights as muslims and homosexuals and they
[11:15.720 --> 11:27.720]  said that the scientific term homosexual like heterosexual was hurtful and homophobic and
[11:27.720 --> 11:38.720]  so he was arrested as an example to everyone that's england that's like if i say caucasians
[11:38.720 --> 11:46.720]  have light skin and they came and arrested me caucasian is a scientific word there is a war
[11:46.720 --> 11:52.720]  against science ladies and gentlemen there is a war against free speech i don't like the
[11:52.720 --> 12:00.720]  ku Klux Klan i've protested them more than a dozen times the videos are on youtube and i would
[12:00.720 --> 12:03.720]  go to the protest and point out that they were really feds a lot of times would turn out they
[12:03.720 --> 12:07.720]  were feds and they would really single me out to death threat me and attack me and the police
[12:07.720 --> 12:13.720]  generally would do nothing in Waco and other areas but i would never call to have their
[12:13.720 --> 12:19.720]  speech taken and by the way when i'd go protest the clan or other mecha la raza hispanic
[12:19.720 --> 12:24.720]  clan groups they would always say how dare you try to stop my free speech no no no free
[12:24.720 --> 12:29.720]  speech means you can say what you want i can say what i want right back you understand how
[12:29.720 --> 12:35.720]  that works to two way street but see the left does what mecha and la raza and the klan and
[12:35.720 --> 12:39.720]  the new black panther party and others will do when you try to go counter demonstrate
[12:39.720 --> 12:43.720]  against them they'll get in your facing stop trying to stop my speech while they're trying
[12:43.720 --> 12:49.720]  to stop yours that's what the the left does they say you can't have your speech and say
[12:49.720 --> 12:55.720]  you're against abortion we're going to have the irs come after you you can't say you think
[12:55.720 --> 13:02.720]  homosexuality is a sin because it's your interpretation of the bible i'm going to try to have you
[13:02.720 --> 13:10.720]  arrested whoa whoa that is over the top totalitarianism and as soon as it got a lot of coverage in
[13:10.720 --> 13:18.720]  the news the last few days bully pulpit houston subpoenas pastors and sermons then backs off
[13:18.720 --> 13:31.720]  amidst outcry i mean this mayor is another crazy anise parker leftist control freak i
[13:31.720 --> 13:37.720]  mean if you're watching on tv you can see here what a dangerous person in america we're
[13:37.720 --> 13:43.720]  going to subpoena and sue with taxpayer money preachers to intimidate them not to read out
[13:43.720 --> 13:53.720]  of the bible and notice what political correctness they only target christians you know all these
[13:53.720 --> 14:03.720]  other mosques and even some of the eastern religions are against homosexuality nobody's
[14:03.720 --> 14:08.720]  telling them to shut up it's always christianity is supposed to shut up and you know there's
[14:08.720 --> 14:13.720]  other examples of killing free speech i'm going to talk about this at the bottom of the hour
[14:13.720 --> 14:19.720]  i went and saw kill the messenger last night and i expected it to be a whitewash i expected
[14:19.720 --> 14:25.720]  it to you know imply that he killed himself and it was absolute truth because i remember
[14:25.720 --> 14:30.720]  garry webbing on the show more than ten times i had all these incredible conversations with
[14:30.720 --> 14:35.720]  garry webb off air he wanted me to build a website for him he sent me all these documents
[14:35.720 --> 14:43.720]  that the cia had broken in his house a bunch to try to get i was too busy making films
[14:43.720 --> 14:49.720]  and making babies with my wife he remember he called back the last time i talked to him
[14:49.720 --> 14:52.720]  a few months before he committed suicide he said hey man alex i thought you had the courage
[14:52.720 --> 14:56.720]  to put this up and do something i said yeah there's thousands of pages of this stuff and
[14:56.720 --> 15:01.720]  a lot of this is court records and stuff and i go i guess i'll put it out because i thought
[15:01.720 --> 15:06.720]  you've got balls i mean these are epic conversations i have with garry webb now i hit movie out
[15:06.720 --> 15:15.720]  about him and it was so surreal to be sitting there in the movie theater and knowing his
[15:15.720 --> 15:20.720]  whole story and it was so accurate and they basically implied that the cia kills him at
[15:20.720 --> 15:24.720]  the end and they show the cia threaten his kids and break in his house and break in his
[15:24.720 --> 15:29.720]  car and steal his motorcycle and it was just i know the story so well i know freeway ricky
[15:29.720 --> 15:34.720]  ross i was the only person ever interviewing him in prison kevin booth got that interview
[15:34.720 --> 15:40.720]  from prison i mean i had the guy on death row on from oakland from from terra hoot who
[15:40.720 --> 15:45.720]  was there and and and saw mcvay admit what was later partially declassified that he was
[15:45.720 --> 15:53.720]  black ops army super special forces set up i just i'm not even here bragging oh my gosh
[15:53.720 --> 16:03.720]  this show is important i felt incredibly guilty that i don't even know where that disk is
[16:03.720 --> 16:10.720]  that cd rom that i opened up but it was just i don't know how to process all this stuff
[16:10.720 --> 16:16.720]  i need to tear apart our storage buildings and find that and then i want to talk about
[16:16.720 --> 16:21.720]  how i had that disk because they were like killing people over this stuff and then i went
[16:21.720 --> 16:26.720]  and searched last night when i got home i went to bed and i woke up middle of the night
[16:26.720 --> 16:33.720]  i went and searched for like an hour at three a.m. four a.m. and i couldn't even find one
[16:33.720 --> 16:37.720]  interview i did with gary webb it's kind of like i did a couple interviews two interviews
[16:37.720 --> 16:45.720]  with charlton heston i could only find one there there were probably 15 interviews with
[16:45.720 --> 16:50.720]  gary webb two hour interviews some of them and this was back when they had demonized
[16:50.720 --> 16:56.720]  even the new york times in the washington post and when they had just torn him apart
[16:56.720 --> 17:00.720]  of course it all turned out everything he said was true it was very accurate he was
[17:00.720 --> 17:03.720]  just pointing out what was already known and even been in congressional hearings years
[17:03.720 --> 17:11.720]  before on southeast asian drug dealing heroin not cocaine not not white girl as they call
[17:11.720 --> 17:27.480]  it and i was just thinking about how bizarre it is that i talked to him a couple months
[17:27.480 --> 17:34.960]  before he died and and i was remembering back my last conversation with him is he got mad
[17:34.960 --> 17:41.080]  at me and slammed the phone down and he was just somebody looking for help because he
[17:41.080 --> 17:45.080]  resigned from the san jose mercury news he was trying to get his stories out on the internet
[17:45.080 --> 17:50.720]  they were breaking in his house a bunch so he moved again he'd pull up and guys would
[17:50.720 --> 17:55.200]  slide down from the second story you know down the drainage pipe they moved into a one
[17:55.200 --> 17:59.520]  story house and then they'd have known cia people write articles about me right after
[17:59.520 --> 18:07.520]  he died saying jones claims that men slid down the drainage pipe but webb lived in a one
[18:07.520 --> 18:12.000]  story well yeah he just moved into it it was just all these games and then watching how
[18:12.000 --> 18:18.240]  they demonized him and how they tried to kill his name before they physically killed him
[18:18.240 --> 18:27.760]  and experiencing a lot of this myself it was a surreal i've never gone and seen a movie
[18:27.760 --> 18:34.920]  where from what i know it was so incredibly accurate and so incredibly sad and then i
[18:34.920 --> 18:42.280]  resonated with it because they always make it about the individual if they can't disprove
[18:42.280 --> 18:47.200]  your facts they just demonize and destroy the individual themselves and i got a sick
[18:47.200 --> 18:51.360]  feeling in my stomach as i realized that the clocks just tick until they come and shoot
[18:51.360 --> 18:57.160]  me in the head twice or plant drugs on me or shoot me at a checkpoint or something and
[18:57.160 --> 19:03.320]  it just it made me sad to watch all the cowards his editors and his bosses at the san jose
[19:03.320 --> 19:07.400]  renews that when it was all the big story they were telling them what a rock story was but
[19:07.400 --> 19:12.120]  then as soon as the system turned against him how the editor of the la times was former
[19:12.120 --> 19:17.640]  cia and they set about to destroy him and the cia declassified three weeks ago on the
[19:17.640 --> 19:24.840]  eve of this film coming out that they indeed set out to destroy gary webb i said i'd covered
[19:24.840 --> 19:29.080]  at the bottom of the hour i'm already doing it who wrote the dark alliance story about
[19:29.080 --> 19:36.440]  cia drug trafficking here's the headline managing a nightmare how the cia watched over the destruction
[19:36.440 --> 19:47.200]  of gary webb it's just it's just so pathetic and then why would the cia admit they did
[19:47.200 --> 19:50.520]  this right when the movie came out because they want everybody to know they want to just
[19:50.520 --> 19:56.160]  literally urinate on the corpse of our republic and scare the media and the press right as

[22:58.400 --> 23:03.160]  On September 30, 2014, the first confirmed case of Ebola appeared in the U.S.
[23:03.160 --> 23:08.680]  This combined with several other unidentified viruses have some of our customers at 30dayfoodsupply.com
[23:08.680 --> 23:14.520]  concerned about the safety of our domestic food supply, resulting in a surge of our $99.90
[23:14.520 --> 23:15.520]  serving kits.

[25:07.720 --> 25:12.440]  a bottle next so don't expect prices to fall too much.
[25:12.440 --> 25:15.400]  This is the type of over the top information.
[25:15.400 --> 25:21.560]  I intended to not even talk about kill the messenger today, but it was so profound last
[25:21.560 --> 25:30.200]  night watching this movie and so personal and so surreal because I was remembering, man
[25:30.200 --> 25:32.640]  I really knew this guy well.
[25:32.640 --> 25:37.680]  He wanted to work with me, he wanted to, he had his new book coming out that was going
[25:37.680 --> 25:43.760]  to be basically self-published exposing the full scope of CIA drug dealing and they killed
[25:43.760 --> 25:44.760]  him.
[25:44.760 --> 25:48.920]  He told me he was being threatened and he told Ricky Ross who's on next Tuesday, the
[25:48.920 --> 25:55.360]  big CIA crack dealer, biggest in West Coast history, that guys were breaking in and they
[25:55.360 --> 26:03.800]  were going to kill him right before they killed him.
[26:03.800 --> 26:11.200]  It's just so unbelievably bizarre that it even came out in Congress in the late 90s
[26:11.200 --> 26:16.840]  for the solicitor and specter general that they were shipping most of cocaine in, but
[26:16.840 --> 26:21.480]  then they knew the public was so dumbed down they would go on national television and say
[26:21.480 --> 26:24.560]  Gary Webb has been discredited.
[26:24.560 --> 26:35.040]  The drug kingpin in the Central American prison says that he never met with him.
[26:35.040 --> 26:39.560]  And then to imagine the LA Times editor who was CIA on record and the movie even points
[26:39.560 --> 26:45.040]  that out, set out to destroy this journalist.
[26:45.040 --> 26:50.680]  I just hope everybody involved in this knows that when they set him down and said we're
[26:50.680 --> 26:55.400]  going to kill your family if you don't write this suicide note and then shot him twice in
[26:55.400 --> 26:59.680]  the head, that all of you are accomplices to that.
[26:59.680 --> 27:04.120]  And they say one man dies as a tragedy, 10,000 dies as a statistic as Joseph Stalin said.
[27:04.120 --> 27:09.760]  It's true, but when you destroy a real journalist and someone who has integrity and courage
[27:09.760 --> 27:17.960]  and who swims against the tide, you then kill the courage of thousands of other journalists
[27:17.960 --> 27:28.040]  and other individuals and whistleblowers and just allow incredible evil to grow.
[27:28.040 --> 27:30.880]  And I wouldn't call the film a whitewash.
[27:30.880 --> 27:34.640]  I've got some of the courtroom scenes where they actually threatened to kill Gary Webb
[27:34.640 --> 27:40.000]  out in the hallway repeatedly.
[27:40.000 --> 27:43.720]  And it has a scene where the feds breaking his house, breaking his car, but this happened
[27:43.720 --> 27:47.280]  on a routine basis and then the CIA wanted to meet with him, so he goes to their offices
[27:47.280 --> 27:49.920]  and they say, we just want you to know your children are safe.
[27:49.920 --> 27:54.680]  I remember Gary Webb telling that story here on air and the fact that he blew up at him
[27:54.680 --> 27:58.080]  and said, I'm going to publish that story no matter what you do.
[27:58.080 --> 27:59.080]  That's real courage.
[27:59.080 --> 28:00.760]  They say, oh, well, I do that really.
[28:00.760 --> 28:05.520]  I haven't found a lot of people that when they say, we're going to kill your kids and
[28:05.520 --> 28:10.160]  I've had them actually tell me we're going to kill your kids if you don't stop and I
[28:10.160 --> 28:11.160]  haven't stopped.
[28:11.160 --> 28:12.160]  And you know why?
[28:12.160 --> 28:17.120]  Because my kids don't have a future if we don't stop this.
[28:17.120 --> 28:22.240]  The allegory and your children don't either is that we're in a ship capsized and if we
[28:22.240 --> 28:28.120]  don't swim the 50 yards through the submerged area, even though it's scary and dark and
[28:28.120 --> 28:33.480]  try to get out, we're all going to drown because it's slowly sinking, but a lot of true stories
[28:33.480 --> 28:34.480]  with this happen.
[28:34.480 --> 28:36.880]  Let's say we had oxygen tanks in there.
[28:36.880 --> 28:40.240]  I'm not going to put oxygen tanks on and just sit there and say, well, I get to live an
[28:40.240 --> 28:41.760]  hour longer than everybody else.
[28:41.760 --> 28:46.640]  If I had oxygen tanks, I'd try to swim out even faster than I would if I didn't have
[28:46.640 --> 28:47.640]  oxygen tanks.
[28:47.640 --> 28:51.240]  But see, people just say, well, the tyranny's rising.
[28:51.240 --> 28:53.760]  I'm going to put an oxygen tank in my mouth.
[28:53.760 --> 28:57.200]  I'm going to put a regulator in my mouth, a mouthpiece in.
[28:57.200 --> 29:01.000]  And I'm just going to try to be the last person standing when this all happens.
[29:01.000 --> 29:03.120]  I'm going to go along and try to survive.
[29:03.120 --> 29:08.040]  No, you'll just be dead in the capsized tyrannical ship of state as well.
[29:08.040 --> 29:10.200]  This country is falling apart.
[29:10.200 --> 29:12.920]  It is just totally disintegrating.
[29:12.920 --> 29:15.400]  Corruption is everywhere.
[29:15.400 --> 29:19.120]  Under the Obama tax laws, they've gotten rid of all the major ride-offs, all the major
[29:19.120 --> 29:20.640]  business incentives.
[29:20.640 --> 29:22.720]  Businesses are shutting down everywhere.
[29:22.720 --> 29:26.680]  It's in the news today that it's the highest federal receipts they've ever had.
[29:26.680 --> 29:29.560]  They are destroying the country on purpose.
[29:29.560 --> 29:31.680]  They are wrecking it and looting it.
[29:31.680 --> 29:34.320]  And I'm done talking about Gary Webb.
[29:34.320 --> 29:37.240]  I'm going to shoot a special report with the Nally News tonight or tomorrow because I really
[29:37.240 --> 29:40.480]  want to do this justice and write some notes and really talk about it.
[29:40.480 --> 29:44.320]  And I want to get my crew to find, send us the links, listeners, go out and search the
[29:44.320 --> 29:45.320]  web.
[29:45.320 --> 29:47.400]  Old podcast, you name it.
[29:47.400 --> 29:52.720]  Send me the Gary Webb interviews I did.
[29:52.720 --> 29:59.680]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[29:59.680 --> 30:05.840]  The experts are clear, sunlight, purified water, healthy non-GMO food, and having a good attitude
[30:05.840 --> 30:07.880]  is essential to a healthy immune system.
[30:07.880 --> 30:15.120]  But I go further with SuperNasinIodineX2 from InfowarsLive.com, 50% stronger than our
[30:15.120 --> 30:20.640]  original and revolutionary nasin iodine formula, coming from a deep earth crystal source that
[30:20.640 --> 30:22.520]  no other supplier has.
[30:22.520 --> 30:27.720]  Most other forms of iodine come from seaweed in areas plagued by Fukushima and other contaminants.
[30:27.720 --> 30:33.200]  Not our iodine, it comes from over 200 million year old crystal salt deposits and is tested
[30:33.200 --> 30:35.200]  and proven to be completely pure.

[30:59.440 --> 31:04.840]  From the water table to our soils to the atmosphere itself, our world is becoming more and more
[31:04.840 --> 31:06.560]  toxic each and every day.
[31:06.560 --> 31:10.920]  But it's not just the air outside that's toxic, indoor air has been shown to have two to five
[31:10.920 --> 31:14.160]  times higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air.
[31:14.160 --> 31:18.760]  And most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their
[31:18.760 --> 31:19.760]  homes.
[31:19.760 --> 31:23.840]  There have been 42 million smokers in the United States, well over a thousand types
[31:23.840 --> 31:26.720]  of mold in mildew linked to numerous conditions.
[31:26.720 --> 31:30.840]  And don't forget the fact that 6 million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well.
[31:30.840 --> 31:35.360]  When I began to research these statistics it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing
[31:35.360 --> 31:40.360]  my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape but that we can fight
[31:40.360 --> 31:41.360]  back against.
[31:41.360 --> 31:45.640]  Made with organic and wild cultivated herbs and manufactured in the USA.
[31:45.640 --> 31:48.200]  The new InfowarsLife Lung Cleanse is here.
[31:48.200 --> 31:52.160]  In a convenient spray bottle it can be brought with you throughout any toxic environment.
[31:52.160 --> 31:58.200]  Now available exclusively at InfowarsLife.com or by calling toll-3888-2533139.
[31:58.200 --> 32:03.920]  General, what do you think about the FBI saying that there is a terror alert on Monday about
[32:03.920 --> 32:05.560]  a potential foreclosure situation?
[32:05.560 --> 32:08.560]  The police are shoving people, shoving Alex, shoving the crowd.
[32:08.560 --> 32:09.560]  Here we go, folks.
[32:09.560 --> 32:10.560]  I'm being assigned to them.
[32:10.560 --> 32:15.640]  Whether it's the radio show, the news websites, documentary films, or the nightly news, Infowars
[32:15.640 --> 32:16.640]  is the tip of the spears.
[32:16.640 --> 32:20.520]  Is this another false-flag-stage attack to take our civil liberties and promote homeland
[32:20.520 --> 32:23.120]  security by sticking the hands down on the against on the streets?
[32:23.120 --> 32:27.400]  It's up to us to set brush fires in the minds of men and women everywhere and that's what
[32:27.400 --> 32:30.120]  PrisonPlanet.tv is designed to do.
[32:30.120 --> 32:36.120]  You watch the Assad regime is going to be blamed or accused of using chemical weapons
[32:36.120 --> 32:38.440]  against the so-called rebels.
[32:38.440 --> 32:41.920]  What we see now is a war against reality, it's a war against the truth.
[32:41.920 --> 32:47.480]  It's more vital than ever that supporters of freedom become members of PrisonPlanet.tv
[32:47.480 --> 32:51.080]  and share their membership with up to 11 friends and family.
[32:51.080 --> 32:53.720]  Visit InfowarsNews.com today.

[33:15.200 --> 33:17.560]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[33:17.560 --> 33:42.440]  Well, we've come out with a $7,500 contest, it's going to be an accelerated contest only
[33:42.440 --> 33:48.080]  two weeks long, then one week to judge, usually I take months, you know, you get a month to
[33:48.080 --> 33:50.200]  do it and a month to judge.
[33:50.200 --> 33:53.800]  We're announcing it today, the contest will end in two weeks and we'll have the winner
[33:53.800 --> 34:03.960]  on Halloween, October 31st, first place $5,000, second place $200, third place $500, but everybody
[34:03.960 --> 34:10.120]  wins because you go print off the posters we've made or make your own poster, exposing the
[34:10.120 --> 34:15.960]  false politically correct deity Obama, exposing collectivism, exposing the open border, whatever
[34:15.960 --> 34:21.960]  spectrum of that you want, use our posters, make your posters, send us your posters, we'll
[34:21.960 --> 34:25.560]  post them on Facebook and Twitter and places.
[34:25.560 --> 34:27.160]  It's about showing the power of the people.
[34:27.160 --> 34:30.440]  We've done some of these contests that have become huge national news stories, they've
[34:30.440 --> 34:31.440]  all been very successful.
[34:31.440 --> 34:37.080]  And what you do is you shoot video of it and then you put it on YouTube, we link to the
[34:37.080 --> 34:41.080]  different videos, people watch them by the millions, you know, big videos get seen a
[34:41.080 --> 34:44.560]  million times, small ones, $5,000, so what, that's a big deal.
[34:44.560 --> 34:48.600]  You go out, you get involved, you hang posters in legal and awful areas, you can be on your
[34:48.600 --> 34:53.280]  own barn, your own business or a commons area, you know, where they hang rock and roll posters
[34:53.280 --> 34:57.440]  or church posters or, you know, dog show posters and nobody cares, but then when you do they'll
[34:57.440 --> 35:03.120]  go, it's horrible, then it arrests them just to show how they want to violate free speech.
[35:03.120 --> 35:07.480]  When that happens and the local news covers it, then they try to shut down free speech,
[35:07.480 --> 35:10.400]  more people do it, it backfires on them.
[35:10.400 --> 35:15.920]  So obola, and we'll do a document cam shot and show people here, two of the posters,
[35:15.920 --> 35:21.120]  we have the files up on infowars.com in the article on the homepage that we're going to
[35:21.120 --> 35:23.720]  tweet out right now and post to Facebook.
[35:23.720 --> 35:31.040]  In fact, I saw them with the contest page about an hour ago, so I don't see it on infowars.com
[35:31.040 --> 35:32.040]  yet.
[35:32.040 --> 35:36.280]  But we'll get that up on infowars.com right now or I guess it's not in the featured news
[35:36.280 --> 35:43.520]  area or maybe it hasn't cashed yet off the cash into my computer, but just we'll get
[35:43.520 --> 35:49.840]  it in the features, top story, this contest, and I'm going to give folks the headline on

[37:28.280 --> 37:34.320]  for you to go out, post the posters, shoot the video, post it on youtube to hopefully
[37:34.320 --> 37:41.680]  spur other people to realize that there is a public stand down going on by obama and
[37:41.680 --> 37:50.360]  the cdc, now senator ted cruz has come out joining governor gendall from two weeks ago,
[37:50.360 --> 37:56.200]  as well as the speaker of the house john bainer saying they should restrict flights out of
[37:56.200 --> 38:04.320]  obola stricken countries and should stop giving visas to non-us citizens to come here, an
[38:04.320 --> 38:09.840]  absolute no brainer, the caribbean islands are doing it, central and south america are
[38:09.840 --> 38:17.520]  doing it, african nations bordering these countries are doing it, italy is doing it,
[38:17.520 --> 38:25.720]  england is doing it, the uk, france, but not the united states because it's a religion,
[38:25.720 --> 38:33.080]  as michael savage said here on air last week, it doesn't matter if other countries can
[38:33.080 --> 38:39.800]  have borders, the united states cannot, there can never be the idea that a border or a
[38:39.800 --> 38:46.200]  nation being for citizens who pay the taxes, that cannot exist, now let's go over the
[38:46.200 --> 38:52.480]  huge stack of breaking obola news to give you the latest on what's happening, associated
[38:52.480 --> 39:00.360]  press reports, obola escalation could trigger major food crisis, the global famine warning
[39:00.360 --> 39:05.880]  system is predicting a major food crisis if the obola outbreak continues to grow exponentially
[39:05.880 --> 39:12.560]  over the coming months and the united nation still hasn't reached over 750,000 people in
[39:12.560 --> 39:20.080]  need of food in west africa who are without food as prices spiral and farms are abandoned,
[39:20.080 --> 39:24.520]  on the eve of the world food day thursday the un agencies and non-governmental organizations
[39:24.520 --> 39:30.080]  are scrambling to scale up efforts to avert widespread hunger, the un goes around with
[39:30.080 --> 39:34.960]  policies to shut down food production worldwide, then they use the famines and wars they stir
[39:34.960 --> 39:40.280]  up on record to then get all the young women mainly to go give money to unicef, that's
[39:40.280 --> 39:46.120]  the news behind the news, the story behind the story, another report out of cbs news
[39:46.120 --> 39:52.840]  dfw airport contractor forced to remove mask and gloves, that's why you've got protests
[39:52.840 --> 39:57.720]  going on and strikes for two and a half weeks in new york and other cities as the people
[39:57.720 --> 40:03.920]  that are supposed to be cleaning the aircraft are told that they can't wear mask and gloves,
[40:03.920 --> 40:09.960]  stuff coming in out of west africa, in some cases with vomit in them, because it'll quote
[40:09.960 --> 40:15.320]  scare people, we're gonna get to those articles in a moment, experts offer steps for avoiding
[40:15.320 --> 40:21.280]  public hysteria, a different contagious threat, so we've been talking about the hysteria being
[40:21.280 --> 40:28.600]  a bigger problem than obola itself, well now the new york times is reporting on it, today
[40:28.600 --> 40:34.400]  there is another one that's very important, cdc, obola patient traveled by air with low
[40:34.400 --> 40:39.360]  grade fever, they'd first said that it was her fault and she shouldn't have done it,
[40:39.360 --> 40:47.160]  but now it's admitted in nbc news that obola patient who can contact at the cdc before
[40:47.160 --> 40:54.000]  flight agency says was told that she could fly even though she was an obola nurse and
[40:54.000 --> 40:58.200]  even though she told him she had a fever, oh by the way i treated the guy that has
[40:58.200 --> 41:06.200]  obola and i'm sick, can i fly, that's like saying my dog has rabies and is foaming at
[41:06.200 --> 41:11.680]  the mouth, should i put it into a schoolyard of kids, yes put the dog with rabies into
[41:11.680 --> 41:17.000]  the schoolyard, or i found a bat crawling around hissing on the ground, should i pick
[41:17.000 --> 41:22.320]  it up and kiss it, yes that's a good idea, there's a cliff by my house a thousand feet
[41:22.320 --> 41:27.200]  to the jagged bottom, should i jump off without a parachute, yes jump off immediately, ring
[41:27.200 --> 41:31.240]  hi i'm a nurse that treated the obola patient cdc, uh huh, uh huh, yeah we know who you
[41:31.240 --> 41:35.480]  are, yeah you're older than this, yeah i'm, i'm gonna fly, of course this time it wasn't
[41:35.480 --> 41:39.320]  on the news, just been around an obola patient, so i was treating an obola patient, i'm gonna
[41:39.320 --> 41:46.800]  fly, i have a fever, oh bediri, that's a great idea, they're not just turning off the defaults,
[41:46.800 --> 41:51.720]  they're sending the obola kids to school, they're not cleaning up the apartment, something
[41:51.720 --> 41:57.840]  weird is going on, and why are nurses getting it, but the family isn't getting it, either
[41:57.840 --> 42:05.960]  they're covering up that they have it, or it's what that cia whistleblower said back
[42:05.960 --> 42:11.960]  in the middle of last month here, mr steel, it was you cue that clip up later, he said
[42:11.960 --> 42:16.440]  he believed they would release a biological simulant that wasn't obola but would make
[42:16.440 --> 42:22.880]  people sick or even kill them to create a false flag, that's what he said on air two
[42:22.880 --> 42:28.440]  weeks before this obola thing even broke or even started, and i'm not saying this isn't
[42:28.440 --> 42:33.880]  real, you got a lot of deaths in africa, over 4,000, you've got hundreds of thousands that
[42:33.880 --> 42:40.080]  have gotten it, who may end up dying from it, you've got un models of 1.4 million dying
[42:40.080 --> 42:45.160]  or getting it, i don't know what the truth is, but if you've got a global system caught
[42:45.160 --> 42:50.120]  staging hoaxes or creating al-qaeda and changing the name and having them attack countries
[42:50.120 --> 42:54.940]  and when the public finds out changing the name again and then the Kurds call for support
[42:54.940 --> 42:59.840]  against them, so you bomb the Kurds instead, i mean this is all happening because of public
[42:59.840 --> 43:06.360]  ignorance, the establishment thinks they can do whatever they want, and beyond public ignorance,
[43:06.360 --> 43:17.400]  this is all happening because even if we're awake the system runs the courts, they run
[43:17.400 --> 43:21.600]  most of the legislative systems, they run the investigative systems, they run the so-called
[43:21.600 --> 43:27.920]  security apparatus, and so they're above the law, but see when elites get above the law
[43:27.920 --> 43:34.960]  they always bring the law of nature into play, they become delusional, they go too far just
[43:34.960 --> 43:39.920]  like criminals do and they end up destroying their own system or destroying themselves
[43:39.920 --> 43:45.440]  or being self-destructive, most psychopaths are very, very meticulous and maybe commit
[43:45.440 --> 43:52.360]  one murder a year for 15, 20 years, then they start committing two or three murders a year
[43:52.360 --> 43:57.880]  for a couple years, then suddenly four or five murders a year, then they'll kill three
[43:57.880 --> 44:02.640]  or four people in a week, and they'll start dumping dead bodies out in the back of the
[44:02.640 --> 44:07.200]  police station and writing letters taunting the police wanting to get caught, we're now
[44:07.200 --> 44:12.680]  reaching that point where they openly say in the council on foreign relations, we need
[44:12.680 --> 44:17.880]  to fund al-qaeda and we are funding al-qaeda, where they openly write books admitting they're
[44:17.880 --> 44:23.040]  putting fluoride in the water to brain damages, the White House science are, where they just
[44:23.040 --> 44:28.960]  say two plus two equals five, you didn't build your business, the death panels are wonderful,
[44:28.960 --> 44:36.320]  on and on and on, this is the point that we've now reached with these people, hi I'm a nurse
[44:36.320 --> 44:42.680]  that treated the Ebola patient in Dallas, I'm sick but I'd like to fly, should I, yes
[44:42.680 --> 44:49.840]  honey you go ahead and do that, they tell you don't fly if you've got a fever period,
[44:49.840 --> 44:54.520]  just like the default until six years ago was a pregnant woman never takes a vaccine,
[44:54.520 --> 44:59.280]  it causes miscarriages, it causes neurological disorders in the babies, it's on record, it's
[44:59.280 --> 45:07.480]  on the inserts, now they say pregnant women need double flu, take two and take everything
[45:07.480 --> 45:14.400]  else, it's all about, I mean I hate to get gross here but you've heard about the phenomenon
[45:14.400 --> 45:18.520]  in government buildings suddenly that people are peeing on the walls and going to the bathroom
[45:18.520 --> 45:22.960]  and cubby holes and in the hallways even though the bathrooms are working perfectly fine
[45:22.960 --> 45:27.920]  and smearing it all over the walls, this is what mental patients do, this is what people
[45:27.920 --> 45:33.400]  who are above the law start doing, is just running around going to the bathroom as poop
[45:33.400 --> 45:39.960]  bandits as they're known, this is what has now happened, in a decadent society that
[45:39.960 --> 45:45.360]  goes insane, Japan used to be the most clean country in the world obsessed with cleanliness,
[45:45.360 --> 45:51.200]  obsessed with being honorable, now Japan has an epidemic of adults, not old people, adults
[45:51.200 --> 45:57.120]  wearing diapers and the big thing is to go to the bathroom on yourself and they have
[45:57.120 --> 46:01.680]  things that I'm not going to even mention on air that are phenomenon now, the most popular
[46:01.680 --> 46:11.120]  overall fetish bars in Japan now are scatological and you say Alex why are you going here, well
[46:11.120 --> 46:16.200]  psychopaths end up killing three people a week when they start falling apart and going
[46:16.200 --> 46:26.440]  off the rails, not one a year, but the average yuppie trendy just starts wallowing around
[46:26.440 --> 46:35.280]  not paying their bills, not working and wearing adult diapers, it's like idiocracy that the
[46:35.280 --> 46:42.000]  Mike Judge made, genius film that he wrote, in the film people are so decadent they think
[46:42.000 --> 46:48.480]  being able to talk is not trendy so the dumber you are the cooler you are and people's easy
[46:48.480 --> 46:53.880]  chairs drive them to the refrigerator so you don't have to get up off your easy chair and
[46:53.880 --> 46:58.760]  have a toilet in them, guess what they've now come out with that, idiocracy came out
[46:58.760 --> 47:08.840]  what 10 years ago, 11 years ago, now guess where Japan is producing easy chairs with
[47:08.840 --> 47:14.880]  toilets in them and robots that wipe your hind end and by the way I'm not the one focusing
[47:14.880 --> 47:20.680]  in on this, this is not potty humor, I'm not five years old or four years old, this is
[47:20.680 --> 47:27.760]  what's happening, our civilization is degenerating and we have this fascist pig mayor down in
[47:27.760 --> 47:37.080]  Houston wanting to arrest preachers that give anti-homosexual sermons, that's where we're
[47:37.080 --> 47:41.000]  going here, we can't stop Ebola but let me tell you we can pay for everybody to have
[47:41.000 --> 47:48.520]  a sex change, this is a society about to collapse, every indicator, every red balloon, every
[47:48.520 --> 48:01.560]  red flag, every yardstick, we are in deep level crisis, let's continue here, 911 emergency
[48:01.560 --> 48:12.680]  dispatchers instructed not to say Ebola over the radio, that's out of Fox News DC, they're
[48:12.680 --> 48:19.320]  being told not to create panic and are being given a secret code to describe Ebola, see
[48:19.320 --> 48:24.800]  the cover-up's already on, as I said Ebola probably is already spreading in the US, they
[48:24.800 --> 48:28.840]  had to let it in and let it breed first and then they'll say they don't know where it
[48:28.840 --> 48:33.320]  all began or where it started and oh it's all Obama's fault and it's going to bring
[48:33.320 --> 48:38.960]  in a medical tyranny, force an oculation and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation dedicated
[48:38.960 --> 48:43.600]  to population reduction and the Monsanto vaccine they produced, I'm going to say that again,
[48:43.600 --> 48:46.360]  Bill Gates, we keep warning you about, people are like, why don't you talk about Bill Gates
[48:46.360 --> 48:51.280]  so much, because I've studied him, he wants to put an Ebola shot in you, you think that's
[48:51.280 --> 48:56.720]  going to be good for you, US embassies and Ebola stricken countries are still processing
[48:56.720 --> 49:04.160]  visas for non-US citizens, that's from Representative Royce of California, chairman of the House
[49:04.160 --> 49:10.200]  Farm Relations Committee, confirming that, frontier jet that carried Ebola patient made
[49:10.200 --> 49:17.440]  five more flights after that, Columbia and other Central South American and Caribbean
[49:17.440 --> 49:23.520]  countries ban Ebola flights from Ebola nations, banners as travel bans should be considered
[49:23.520 --> 49:29.320]  by President as Ebola crisis worsens, Senator Cruz says they should recall Congress, think
[49:29.320 --> 49:36.040]  so, yeah, recall Congress, vote on whether to authorize bombing ISIS or not, which you're
[49:36.040 --> 49:44.360]  supposed to do, they haven't done that, and vote on this, why no protective gear for man
[49:44.360 --> 49:48.160]  with Dallas Ebola patient, we have video of this, we'll roll some of it in the background,
[49:48.160 --> 49:53.880]  the video from CBS News is up on infowars.com, prisonplanet.com, this lends credence to Rob
[49:53.880 --> 49:59.000]  Dew running around the office thinking this is crisis actors, because he's been analyzing
[49:59.000 --> 50:06.160]  video and he's worked at national TV, home shopping network, he's to be a director there,
[50:06.160 --> 50:13.320]  and so he knows state stuff, and he says that why are people not wearing protective gear
[50:13.320 --> 50:21.240]  did the Ebola patient, as we have right there, and is it people just don't care, they're
[50:21.240 --> 50:27.400]  idiots, or is it staged, a lot of people around here think it's something staged, doesn't
[50:27.400 --> 50:33.400]  mean there's not Ebola out there, it just means, again you've got a supposed Ebola patient,
[50:33.400 --> 50:37.680]  and you've got somebody walking around with him with a clipboard, not even wearing a paper
[50:37.680 --> 50:48.160]  mask, you've got cops out there standing around, and then you've got this individual directing
[50:48.160 --> 50:58.320]  them, I don't know, so fresher bowl of fierce hit airline stocks, we've got a bunch of news
[50:58.320 --> 51:00.360]  coming up on that front.

[54:10.720 --> 54:15.120]  Jeremy Renner of Hurt Locker, such a huge star now.
[54:15.120 --> 54:17.720]  Just going back to why I talked to the master was so powerful.
[54:17.720 --> 54:22.080]  I knew Gary Webb, never met him in person by interviewing probably 15 or more times.
[54:22.080 --> 54:27.920]  Met him on the phone dozens and dozens of times for hours at some point.
[54:27.920 --> 54:31.400]  My wife remembers all this.
[54:31.400 --> 54:36.560]  And when I watched the movie, he talked and acted just like Gary Webb.
[54:36.560 --> 54:39.600]  I mean, he should win an Oscar for this.
[54:39.600 --> 54:44.400]  But if people didn't know Gary Webb, they won't know what a great job Jeremy Renner
[54:44.400 --> 54:45.400]  did.
[54:45.400 --> 54:47.880]  And that's a whole other side issue.
[54:47.880 --> 54:53.520]  I'm getting into Ebola, what's happening in the stock market right now.
[54:53.520 --> 54:55.680]  It's just crazy.
[54:55.680 --> 55:00.120]  And then we've got all this whistleblower intel coming in.
[55:00.120 --> 55:06.240]  Whistleblowers and infowars.com, that's whistleblowers with an s, and infowars.com of your nurses,
[55:06.240 --> 55:12.760]  medical workers, military, family that's got military over there sending 5,000 US troops.
[55:12.760 --> 55:15.520]  Most of them aren't even trained in NBC properly.
[55:15.520 --> 55:20.320]  They're trained how to put on NBC gear, but they're not NBC specialists.
[55:20.320 --> 55:21.680]  Is a perfect way.
[55:21.680 --> 55:25.400]  And now they've got the Joint Chiefs of Staff saying that they will quarantine US troops
[55:25.400 --> 55:26.680]  when and if they get it.
[55:26.680 --> 55:29.960]  I mean, what a disaster.
[55:29.960 --> 55:31.760]  You don't send soldiers.
[55:31.760 --> 55:37.060]  You send volunteer virologists and epidemiologists to the hot zone.
[55:37.060 --> 55:44.360]  You do not send soldiers unless you're training them for martial law.
[55:44.360 --> 55:47.560]  I don't know exactly what's going on, but I'll tell you this.
[55:47.560 --> 55:51.960]  Most of this is staged, it's scripted, and they clearly want Ebola to spread.
[55:51.960 --> 55:55.200]  Now you can fill in the blank of why.
[55:55.200 --> 56:00.480]  My head is spinning at this point, and I'm trying to contain my anger.
[56:00.480 --> 56:04.400]  Even during the break, so I'm trying to contain it.
[56:04.400 --> 56:07.000]  Because I think about how they're trying to bring down this country.
[56:07.000 --> 56:09.360]  Now they're trying to kill our prosperity.
[56:09.360 --> 56:12.360]  It makes me angry.
[56:12.360 --> 56:17.360]  And you can see the CDC ignoring their own protocols on purpose.
[56:17.360 --> 56:20.440]  Folks, they wouldn't let people with TB in.
[56:20.440 --> 56:22.360]  They're letting people with Ebola in.
[56:22.360 --> 56:26.080]  CDC says it missed opportunities to contain Ebola.
[56:26.080 --> 56:27.080]  Oh, we're sorry.
[56:27.080 --> 56:28.580]  It's getting out now.
[56:28.580 --> 56:29.760]  Oh my goodness.
[56:29.760 --> 56:33.880]  That's out of Yahoo News, AP nurses.
[56:33.880 --> 56:36.960]  We were told to call authorities for Ebola protocol.
[56:36.960 --> 56:40.280]  You don't take Ebola patients to a regular hospital.
[56:40.280 --> 56:44.120]  The default is you take them to a CDC emergency center.
[56:44.120 --> 56:48.160]  They got 36 of them.
[56:48.160 --> 56:52.280]  That's why Bloomberg two days ago was asking, why weren't they sent to the government facilities
[56:52.280 --> 56:54.080]  that are designed for this?
[56:54.080 --> 56:56.040]  Because they want it to spread.
[56:56.040 --> 56:59.400]  They want plausible deniability.
[56:59.400 --> 57:03.080]  They probably got sleeper cells walking around spreading it.
[57:03.080 --> 57:06.080]  I didn't think they'd use Muslim radicals to bring it in before.
[57:06.080 --> 57:10.160]  I thought that was just some, you know, Islamophobe hype.
[57:10.160 --> 57:13.680]  But now it's starting to click that God only knows.
[57:13.680 --> 57:16.240]  I think the other shoe is about to drop.
[57:16.240 --> 57:17.600]  I think something big is about to happen.
[57:17.600 --> 57:20.480]  I've been saying that for months, and now you see this breaking loose.
[57:20.480 --> 57:24.440]  I think what you're seeing right now might be a diversion for nukes they're about to
[57:24.440 --> 57:25.440]  set off.
[57:25.440 --> 57:27.680]  Remember all the missing nukes?
[57:27.680 --> 57:34.080]  I am literally never have been on spider sense level like this.
[57:34.080 --> 57:35.080]  I have never.
[57:35.080 --> 57:37.680]  And I'm not trying to panic people, folks.
[57:37.680 --> 57:42.920]  I'm trying to get you to understand that you just see all the indicators on the stock market
[57:42.920 --> 57:47.400]  and a government funding al-Qaeda and trying to start wars with Russia and raising the
[57:47.400 --> 57:50.440]  taxes to the country shuts down and Obamacare.
[57:50.440 --> 57:55.720]  I mean, it is just, we have enemies in control that there is no doubt that we are in the
[57:55.720 --> 57:59.520]  most grave danger this country has faced in 240 years.
[57:59.520 --> 58:02.240]  And I just got hardcore chills.
[58:02.240 --> 58:08.440]  I got goosebumps on my face right now that the camera can probably pick up.
[58:08.440 --> 58:09.880]  They are getting ready to drop the hammer.
[58:09.880 --> 58:11.880]  This is the takedown of the country.
[58:11.880 --> 58:13.360]  I'm getting my immune system ready.
[58:13.360 --> 58:22.400]  I know that infowarslife.com, the survival shield X2, super male, super female vitality,
[58:22.400 --> 58:27.400]  the oxy powder that flushes out the gut, 70% of the immune system they say is in the guts,
[58:27.400 --> 58:29.160]  the lung cleanse, all of it.
[58:29.160 --> 58:30.800]  That's what I'm doing for me and my family.
[58:30.800 --> 58:39.560]  I say support the broadcast infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139, stay with us second hour coming
[58:39.560 --> 58:40.560]  up.
[58:40.560 --> 58:41.560]  Thank you for that.
[58:41.560 --> 58:42.560]  Tell your friends and family to an end.
[58:42.560 --> 58:47.080]  The shed and the drill and end the game, I've always been, infowars has always been at the
[58:47.080 --> 58:49.920]  center of the real fight.
[58:49.920 --> 58:54.840]  Using unparalleled research in the development of a synergistic formulation based around the
[58:54.840 --> 59:00.400]  key concepts of super oxygenation, the next level in cleansing is here with key ingredients
[59:00.400 --> 59:02.320]  backed by real clinical studies.
[59:02.320 --> 59:07.520]  The new oxy powder, available through infowarslife, was invented during Dr. Group's research on
[59:07.520 --> 59:09.400]  the toxification of our bodies.
[59:09.400 --> 59:14.640]  Many herbal colon cleansers are harsh on the body and contain cheap and potentially dangerous
[59:14.640 --> 59:19.680]  ingredients, oftentimes full of synthetic fillers, GMOs, additives or worse.
[59:19.680 --> 59:24.480]  Gently start cleaning your body with easy capsules that start working while you sleep.
[59:24.480 --> 59:29.280]  Oxy powder does not require time off work and there's no need for bad taste and concoctions.
[59:29.280 --> 59:35.640]  Instead, oxy powder slowly releases monoatomic oxygen into the intestinal tract and body.
[59:35.640 --> 59:40.360]  Experience the astonishing cleansing power of super oxide and ozonide technology.
[59:40.360 --> 59:52.280]  Go to infowarslife.com or infowarsstore.com to get started with oxy powder or call 1-888-253-3139.
[59:52.280 --> 1:00:05.600]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:00:05.600 --> 1:00:10.400]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[1:00:10.400 --> 1:00:11.400]  You want answers?
[1:00:11.400 --> 1:00:13.560]  Well, so does he.
[1:00:13.560 --> 1:00:22.560]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network and now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[1:00:22.560 --> 1:00:27.680]  Hi, Dr. Steve Pocenick, I wanted to get him on a few weeks ago about North Korea where
[1:00:27.680 --> 1:00:28.680]  he's been.
[1:00:28.680 --> 1:00:33.640]  I wanted to get him on about funding al-Qaeda, I wanted to get him on about messing with Russia.
[1:00:33.640 --> 1:00:40.680]  He'll give you a big insider, you know, council on foreign relations guy until he resigned.
[1:00:40.680 --> 1:00:46.000]  Exposes 9-11 as an inside job, did the Camp David Accords, is a psychiatrist and medical
[1:00:46.000 --> 1:00:51.720]  doctor, and when it gets to super spooky spooks, he's it.
[1:00:51.720 --> 1:00:58.040]  So he's going to be joining us, co-wrote a bunch of books and movies with Tom Clancy.
[1:00:58.040 --> 1:01:02.400]  So Steve Pocenick's coming in on for 30, 40 minutes, then we got Max Kaiser popping in
[1:01:02.400 --> 1:01:08.360]  on what's happening with the bond market, and I need to be more professional.
[1:01:08.360 --> 1:01:11.520]  But one side of me says I should settle down and not be so angry because this is not an
[1:01:11.520 --> 1:01:12.520]  act.
[1:01:12.520 --> 1:01:14.520]  I can barely do the radio show at this point, okay?
[1:01:14.520 --> 1:01:19.040]  I mean, I can barely even be here at this point because the insanity of them bringing
[1:01:19.040 --> 1:01:24.240]  Ebola patients in, letting it spread, not putting them in level four facilities, they're doing
[1:01:24.240 --> 1:01:28.480]  it on purpose, they are not inept.
[1:01:28.480 --> 1:01:31.640]  And people are like, oh, it won't spread that bad.
[1:01:31.640 --> 1:01:34.520]  I don't know what they're up to, but it's bad, okay?
[1:01:34.520 --> 1:01:39.360]  This is part of some big, nasty war they're about to launch.
[1:01:39.360 --> 1:01:43.640]  Just like the Fast and Furious and Benghazi and the open borders and the superviruses
[1:01:43.640 --> 1:01:49.240]  out of Latin America and the shutting down the power plants, and I don't even care about
[1:01:49.240 --> 1:01:50.240]  money, folks.
[1:01:50.240 --> 1:01:54.480]  I mean, I've always tried to have crew and members and build an operation and spend
[1:01:54.480 --> 1:01:59.160]  almost all the money that comes in on the operation and all my employees pay taxes.
[1:01:59.160 --> 1:02:05.400]  Now, they've got it set up where if I buy equipment and things, it's counted as like
[1:02:05.400 --> 1:02:10.040]  money I have, and so I'm like paying more taxes.
[1:02:10.040 --> 1:02:14.880]  I have to like make more money to pay taxes, not even to get money.
[1:02:14.880 --> 1:02:15.920]  This is new.
[1:02:15.920 --> 1:02:17.160]  This country's gone.
[1:02:17.160 --> 1:02:20.960]  I've got to go hire accounting firms like Arthur Anderson, basically.
[1:02:20.960 --> 1:02:26.440]  I've been told by lawyers to play all sorts of games to even make any money.
[1:02:26.440 --> 1:02:31.160]  And it's not that I'm even upset that I'm not making any money as I bring in record
[1:02:31.160 --> 1:02:33.920]  amounts to run the operation.
[1:02:33.920 --> 1:02:40.800]  It's that this government's so evil that in America, folks, if you are truly upper middle
[1:02:40.800 --> 1:02:45.960]  class and you run an operation that costs over $10 million a year to run, that they've
[1:02:45.960 --> 1:02:50.920]  got it set up that if you play by their rules and you pay the taxes and use the standard,
[1:02:50.920 --> 1:02:55.800]  you know, CPA firm, show your bullet proof to not be audited, that they just take all
[1:02:55.800 --> 1:02:58.240]  your money and give it to the government, basically.
[1:02:58.240 --> 1:03:02.920]  They let you keep like 10% of it.
[1:03:02.920 --> 1:03:04.800]  I mean, what a screwed up nation.
[1:03:04.800 --> 1:03:09.800]  The United States is now 36th in the world, came out in a big college study last month
[1:03:09.800 --> 1:03:12.480]  for economic and social freedom as well.
[1:03:12.480 --> 1:03:15.080]  We used to be number one.
[1:03:15.080 --> 1:03:17.520]  We're 36th in the world.
[1:03:17.520 --> 1:03:23.800]  Folks, we're not a free country anymore, except for free speech, and now the stinking mayor
[1:03:23.800 --> 1:03:33.000]  is suing and subpoenaing a whole bunch of churches that criticize the city's plan to
[1:03:33.000 --> 1:03:39.400]  basically pay for sex changes and make the public schools have, you know, boys and girls
[1:03:39.400 --> 1:03:40.400]  in each other's bathrooms.
[1:03:40.400 --> 1:03:44.840]  You know how much trouble that would have caused when I was in high school?
[1:03:44.840 --> 1:03:49.040]  I mean, I'm not a modest person, but I didn't like going to the bathroom when somebody else
[1:03:49.040 --> 1:03:50.040]  was in there.
[1:03:50.040 --> 1:03:55.640]  And that's really uncomfortable, to be in the bathroom with girls, and it's just these
[1:03:55.640 --> 1:03:58.760]  pervert weirdos wanting to mess with us.
[1:03:58.760 --> 1:04:03.160]  I mean, can't we go to the crapper and not have women in the day?
[1:04:03.160 --> 1:04:08.960]  I mean, I'm getting, this country's run by a bunch of mind control lunatics.
[1:04:08.960 --> 1:04:14.160]  I've had it with you people, with you freaks who want to run our lives.
[1:04:14.160 --> 1:04:18.720]  You want to dress up like a woman, more power to you, I don't care, but stop messing with
[1:04:18.720 --> 1:04:20.200]  our kids.
[1:04:20.200 --> 1:04:23.760]  Oh man, I'm sick of it.
[1:04:23.760 --> 1:04:26.560]  Leave us alone, but they crave running our lives.
[1:04:26.560 --> 1:04:29.720]  They crave to a Rachel Maddow and all these people.
[1:04:29.720 --> 1:04:32.160]  They crave telling us two plus two equals five.
[1:04:32.160 --> 1:04:35.880]  They crave telling us we didn't build our business as they suck everything out of us.
[1:04:35.880 --> 1:04:36.880]  They crave it.
[1:04:36.880 --> 1:04:39.880]  They crave destroying this country.
[1:04:39.880 --> 1:04:40.880]  They crave it.
[1:04:40.880 --> 1:04:42.880]  A bunch of mentally ill people.
[1:04:42.880 --> 1:04:48.880]  Out of Steve Picciani's going to join us, I'm going to try to settle down a little bit,
[1:04:48.880 --> 1:04:54.280]  but it's just incredible all the news we've got to cover here today, infowars.com, prosandplanet.tv.
[1:04:54.280 --> 1:04:59.680]  If you're watching or listening to this transmission, you are the resistance.

[1:05:05.160 --> 1:05:08.120]  attitude is essential to a healthy immune system.
[1:05:08.120 --> 1:05:14.960]  But I go further with super nascent iodine X2 from infowarseline.com, 50% stronger than
[1:05:14.960 --> 1:05:19.960]  our original and revolutionary nascent iodine formula, coming from a deep earth crystal
[1:05:19.960 --> 1:05:22.500]  source that no other supplier has.
[1:05:22.500 --> 1:05:27.740]  Most other forms of iodine come from seaweed in areas plagued by Fukushima and other contaminants.
[1:05:27.740 --> 1:05:33.200]  Not our iodine, it comes from over 200 million year old crystal salt deposits and is tested
[1:05:33.200 --> 1:05:35.200]  and proven to be completely pure.

[1:06:02.880 --> 1:06:07.960]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors
[1:06:07.960 --> 1:06:11.280]  and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[1:06:11.280 --> 1:06:16.560]  Just one of the key compounds, BiopQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.
[1:06:16.560 --> 1:06:19.080]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?

[1:06:29.480 --> 1:06:33.120]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[1:06:33.120 --> 1:06:37.480]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[1:06:37.480 --> 1:06:39.520]  Can you put two and two together?
[1:06:39.520 --> 1:06:45.080]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and 308 sniper rounds, is reasonably
[1:06:45.080 --> 1:06:47.120]  priced and fully legal.
[1:06:47.120 --> 1:06:48.200]  But for how long?
[1:06:48.200 --> 1:06:55.200]  Go to infidelbodyarmor.com, spelled I-N-F-I-D-E-L body armor dot com.
[1:06:55.200 --> 1:06:59.040]  Infidel Body Armor just won't quit.
[1:06:59.040 --> 1:07:04.120]  From the water table to our soils, to the atmosphere itself, our world is becoming more
[1:07:04.120 --> 1:07:06.160]  and more toxic each and every day.
[1:07:06.160 --> 1:07:08.520]  But it's not just the air outside that's toxic.
[1:07:08.520 --> 1:07:12.560]  Indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants
[1:07:12.560 --> 1:07:13.800]  than even outdoor air.
[1:07:13.800 --> 1:07:18.560]  And most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their
[1:07:18.560 --> 1:07:19.560]  homes.
[1:07:19.560 --> 1:07:22.360]  There are more than 42 million smokers in the United States.
[1:07:22.360 --> 1:07:26.360]  Well over a thousand types of mold in mildew linked to numerous conditions.
[1:07:26.360 --> 1:07:29.840]  And don't forget the fact that six million Americans live with pets they're allergic
[1:07:29.840 --> 1:07:30.840]  to as well.
[1:07:30.840 --> 1:07:35.000]  When I began to research these statistics, it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing
[1:07:35.000 --> 1:07:40.200]  my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape until we can fight back
[1:07:40.200 --> 1:07:41.200]  against.
[1:07:41.200 --> 1:07:45.280]  Made with organic and wild cultivated herbs and manufactured in the USA.
[1:07:45.280 --> 1:07:49.400]  The new Info Wars Life Lung Cleanse is here in a convenient spray bottle that can be
[1:07:49.400 --> 1:07:51.800]  brought with you throughout any toxic environment.
[1:07:51.800 --> 1:08:02.000]  Now available exclusively at infowarslife.com or by calling toll 3-888-2533-139.
[1:08:02.000 --> 1:08:04.600]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[1:08:04.600 --> 1:08:07.800]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[1:08:07.800 --> 1:08:12.640]  Well Ebola anxiety is growing.
[1:08:12.640 --> 1:08:16.880]  The UN says the threat of the virus might interfere with commerce and daily routines.
[1:08:16.880 --> 1:08:22.520]  It's even tied to global stock markets being down and the bulls running for the exits on
[1:08:22.520 --> 1:08:24.880]  US treasuries.
[1:08:24.880 --> 1:08:29.440]  The yield on a 10-year treasury, a key barometer of the strength of US economy fell below two
[1:08:29.440 --> 1:08:33.880]  percent for the first time since the Federal Reserve began talking about removing its monetary
[1:08:33.880 --> 1:08:41.480]  stimulus in May of 2013 or ending QE Unlimited or QE Infinity.
[1:08:41.480 --> 1:08:43.040]  Yes it's not going to be Infinity.
[1:08:43.040 --> 1:08:45.840]  Well they're still going to give central banks unlimited free money.
[1:08:45.840 --> 1:08:48.080]  You're not going to be getting it.
[1:08:48.080 --> 1:08:52.840]  You call it stagflation because you have a depression in the real economy and major commodities
[1:08:52.840 --> 1:08:55.320]  like oil except for gold.
[1:08:55.320 --> 1:08:57.480]  That's up today.
[1:08:57.480 --> 1:09:02.760]  And you have a depression in the real economy in the West but also in Asia to a great extent.
[1:09:02.760 --> 1:09:04.480]  That growth is slowing.
[1:09:04.480 --> 1:09:09.760]  But then you do have devaluation of currencies worldwide and so that's inflationary and they're
[1:09:09.760 --> 1:09:15.240]  trying to throttle the two back and forth to consolidate control.
[1:09:15.240 --> 1:09:19.040]  The central banks are not operating to build a bigger pie now.
[1:09:19.040 --> 1:09:21.120]  You could argue whether they were good or bad in their history.
[1:09:21.120 --> 1:09:22.120]  It's varied.
[1:09:22.120 --> 1:09:30.720]  But now certainly they are serving centralized interests that seek under an agenda 21 clowered
[1:09:30.720 --> 1:09:37.080]  and piven style strategy to depress the global economy, give themselves unlimited liquidity
[1:09:37.080 --> 1:09:39.920]  so they can buy up world markets.
[1:09:39.920 --> 1:09:41.400]  So it's economic warfare.
[1:09:41.400 --> 1:09:46.680]  It's a consolidation and it's not being done like the British empire with mercantilism
[1:09:46.680 --> 1:09:52.560]  or the French system to make its colonies be subservient and poor while making the empire
[1:09:52.560 --> 1:09:54.280]  rich.
[1:09:54.280 --> 1:10:00.440]  That is a parasitic system but still it creates largesse for those who are culturally part
[1:10:00.440 --> 1:10:02.960]  of the empire or religiously part of it.
[1:10:02.960 --> 1:10:09.200]  This is a very centralized system and Dr. Steve Pachennick joins us to cover the waterfront.
[1:10:09.200 --> 1:10:12.720]  I know he's worked on the economy a lot and worked in big banking but I remember the council
[1:10:12.720 --> 1:10:17.120]  on farm relations helped run the successful Camp David Accords, co-wrote books and made
[1:10:17.120 --> 1:10:23.640]  films with Tom Clancy, ran psychological operations out of the State Department, advising the military
[1:10:23.640 --> 1:10:26.920]  and the CIA for those that don't know how it works, the State Department pretty much
[1:10:26.920 --> 1:10:28.920]  runs it all.
[1:10:28.920 --> 1:10:34.480]  And so he is a spy spy and of course worked with the Bushes and James Baker and all the
[1:10:34.480 --> 1:10:35.480]  rest of them.
[1:10:35.480 --> 1:10:37.280]  So he'll give you his unique perspective.
[1:10:37.280 --> 1:10:39.080]  I don't know what it is yet.
[1:10:39.080 --> 1:10:40.080]  You can go to StevePachennick.com.
[1:10:40.080 --> 1:10:41.080]  I've seen some of his views.
[1:10:41.080 --> 1:10:44.720]  But I want to know his view on what's happening in the world markets.
[1:10:44.720 --> 1:10:47.800]  Clearly they stood down with Ebola, let it begin to spread.
[1:10:47.800 --> 1:10:48.800]  What is that about?
[1:10:48.800 --> 1:10:49.800]  About a vaccine?
[1:10:49.800 --> 1:10:51.360]  A political diversion?
[1:10:51.360 --> 1:10:53.320]  Or maybe he disagrees with me.
[1:10:53.320 --> 1:10:54.480]  What's happening with ISIS?
[1:10:54.480 --> 1:10:55.480]  What's happening with Russia?
[1:10:55.480 --> 1:11:00.800]  To cover the waterfront, Dr. Steve Pachennick, North Korea, where he traveled last year,
[1:11:00.800 --> 1:11:01.800]  reported for us.
[1:11:01.800 --> 1:11:03.320]  Thank you for coming on with us today.
[1:11:03.320 --> 1:11:05.320]  Oh, it's always a pleasure, Alex.
[1:11:05.320 --> 1:11:07.640]  I don't know if I can bring you the good news.
[1:11:07.640 --> 1:11:12.120]  I can give you some of the bad news, some of the better news, but I'll try to do the
[1:11:12.120 --> 1:11:13.360]  best I can.
[1:11:13.360 --> 1:11:16.800]  Number one, Ebola is a real problem.
[1:11:16.800 --> 1:11:21.120]  It's a problem that's been outstanding for quite a while and we've done nothing about
[1:11:21.120 --> 1:11:22.120]  it.
[1:11:22.120 --> 1:11:26.480]  Once again, as I said about our president, he's really quite failed in leadership, as
[1:11:26.480 --> 1:11:28.480]  you've seen repeatedly.
[1:11:28.480 --> 1:11:34.680]  More importantly, however, the CDC or the Center for Disease Control has really failed.
[1:11:34.680 --> 1:11:40.880]  And I think I would ask for Dr. Frieden, the director of the CDC, to resign immediately.
[1:11:40.880 --> 1:11:43.640]  He has been repeatedly wrong.
[1:11:43.640 --> 1:11:45.520]  He has given the wrong advice.
[1:11:45.520 --> 1:11:50.400]  He has approached it with very inappropriate comments.
[1:11:50.400 --> 1:11:53.880]  And by the way, doctor, I should add you're not just a psychiatrist, board certified
[1:11:53.880 --> 1:11:58.480]  examining psychiatrist who's run major institutions, I'm not bragging, just your credentials.
[1:11:58.480 --> 1:12:02.320]  You're also a medical doctor on top of that so you can speak to Ebola.
[1:12:02.320 --> 1:12:03.920]  Yes, correctly.
[1:12:03.920 --> 1:12:09.160]  And more importantly, I was trained at Cornell University Medical College between 64 and
[1:12:09.160 --> 1:12:16.360]  1968 by a very competent infectious disease doctor who's really the foremost infectious
[1:12:16.360 --> 1:12:17.360]  disease doctor.
[1:12:17.360 --> 1:12:18.560]  You see him on television.
[1:12:18.560 --> 1:12:23.800]  That is Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute for Infectious Diseases.
[1:12:23.800 --> 1:12:28.920]  And what I have recommended and repeatedly recommended is that Dr. Frieden of the CDC
[1:12:28.920 --> 1:12:38.000]  resign at the CDC placed on stand-down because they're not effective, they've been inefficient,
[1:12:38.000 --> 1:12:43.840]  and they have no authoritative capacity to demand either the city, the state, or any
[1:12:43.840 --> 1:12:47.080]  institution to do what's mandatory.
[1:12:47.080 --> 1:12:52.760]  And instead, I think that Fauci, Dr. Tony Fauci, should be given executive privilege
[1:12:52.760 --> 1:12:58.280]  or executive authority by the president of the United States, consistent with 1892 constitutional
[1:12:58.280 --> 1:13:03.480]  authority when both military powers, it need be because we no longer have the public health
[1:13:03.480 --> 1:13:05.520]  service, which is not functioning.
[1:13:05.520 --> 1:13:08.600]  We don't seem to have a surge in general, that's not functioning.
[1:13:08.600 --> 1:13:11.240]  We don't have HHS, which is not functioning.
[1:13:11.240 --> 1:13:16.640]  So every civilian branch of our government is just a bit functional, which is consistent
[1:13:16.640 --> 1:13:17.960]  with your argument.
[1:13:17.960 --> 1:13:21.600]  I don't know why you're paying taxes because none of this is working.
[1:13:21.600 --> 1:13:25.280]  What is working, and I will tell you, and there's some of those who, the people out
[1:13:25.280 --> 1:13:29.400]  there who disagree with me, but I think it's important for me to elucidate, is that we
[1:13:29.400 --> 1:13:36.120]  have 4,000 soldiers that were sent into Liberia, Sierra Leone, and West Africa, not to control
[1:13:36.120 --> 1:13:42.720]  it, but basically to maintain an institute that's called ISR, Intelligence, Surveillance,
[1:13:42.720 --> 1:13:43.720]  and Reconnaissance.
[1:13:43.720 --> 1:13:49.360]  Most of the drones that were used in the Afghan-Pakistani war now use to fight disease.
[1:13:49.360 --> 1:13:51.440]  And this is important now.
[1:13:51.440 --> 1:13:57.800]  The military has switched from a combatant role in West Africa to a very effective disease
[1:13:57.800 --> 1:14:03.040]  control and surveillance role, where we need the intelligence that the civilians could
[1:14:03.040 --> 1:14:04.040]  not provide.
[1:14:04.040 --> 1:14:09.200]  But our military general, thanks to Martin Dempsey, has been able to provide, and General
[1:14:09.200 --> 1:14:14.960]  Williams in North Africa, and our brave men and women who volunteered to go to AFRICOM,
[1:14:14.960 --> 1:14:20.760]  in order to monitor through intelligence, through surveillance, through data mining,
[1:14:20.760 --> 1:14:26.760]  and through training the Liberian Army, and maintaining a peace accord between the Liberian
[1:14:26.760 --> 1:14:32.920]  Army and Sierra Leone, because these two countries that are replete with people are ready to
[1:14:32.920 --> 1:14:33.920]  fight each other.
[1:14:33.920 --> 1:14:38.680]  So our soldiers are really in a unique position that we really talk about.
[1:14:38.680 --> 1:14:44.920]  So you're saying it's a good move to send in 4,000 troops to cause, to stop civil war,
[1:14:44.920 --> 1:14:50.640]  and to try to give intelligence, humance, but also electronic surveillance, to be able
[1:14:50.640 --> 1:14:53.720]  to model the battle space, and to try to stop Ebola.
[1:14:53.720 --> 1:14:56.280]  So are you saying that's a good move by Obama?
[1:14:56.280 --> 1:14:57.280]  One of the few good moves?
[1:14:57.280 --> 1:14:58.280]  Yes.
[1:14:58.280 --> 1:15:03.280]  That was an excellent move, and that was initiated by our military, and Obama agreed to it.
[1:15:03.280 --> 1:15:08.600]  But I give full credit to General Martin Dempsey, General Williams, and the AFRICOM units, because
[1:15:08.600 --> 1:15:13.760]  they initiated this perspective, saying that we have to get in there very quickly, be
[1:15:13.760 --> 1:15:19.920]  able to contain the situation, and be able to monitor the entire battlefield of diseases
[1:15:19.920 --> 1:15:24.760]  and transfer all of their assets, intelligence assets, to West Africa.
[1:15:24.760 --> 1:15:30.080]  Eventually, I would hope that the plane flight from Liberia and Sierra Leone would cease
[1:15:30.080 --> 1:15:31.080]  and desist.
[1:15:31.080 --> 1:15:36.160]  This is absolute nonsense that United and Belgian Airlines is saying that this helps
[1:15:36.160 --> 1:15:37.840]  humanitarian conditions.
[1:15:37.840 --> 1:15:39.120]  It does not.
[1:15:39.120 --> 1:15:45.920]  We need an isolation, we need a quarantine area, which we have had historically in 1890
[1:15:45.920 --> 1:15:49.480]  when immigrants came into the United States through Ellis Island.
[1:15:49.480 --> 1:15:54.360]  We then had a very effective paramilitary organization called the Public Health Service,
[1:15:54.360 --> 1:15:56.800]  which I don't see working at all anymore.
[1:15:56.800 --> 1:16:02.360]  So instead, the military took over, became very efficient and very effective, and brought
[1:16:02.360 --> 1:16:08.800]  along with them Dr. Tony Fauci, who supersedes in capacity and capability Dr. Frieden, who
[1:16:08.800 --> 1:16:15.160]  should resign, the CDC should stand down, and now everyone should prepare their respective
[1:16:15.160 --> 1:16:18.000]  hospitals for the Ebola outbreak.
[1:16:18.000 --> 1:16:21.720]  The Ebola is really a nasty virus.
[1:16:21.720 --> 1:16:23.320]  Let me give you a comparison.
[1:16:23.320 --> 1:16:30.560]  On any unit of blood, there will be an HIV, about 10 million HIV, by rise, or viruses.
[1:16:30.560 --> 1:16:37.040]  In Ebola, in contrast, on that same unit of blood, you will have 10 billion Ebola viruses.
[1:16:37.040 --> 1:16:43.720]  So as you get sicker, the greater amount of viruses increases exponentially, and it spreads
[1:16:43.720 --> 1:16:44.720]  exponentially.
[1:16:44.720 --> 1:16:50.000]  So when you had that nurse who came in from Dallas last night, Cleveland and from Cleveland
[1:16:50.000 --> 1:16:56.680]  to Dallas, and then Dallas, Atlanta, she had potentially infected 134 people.
[1:16:56.680 --> 1:17:03.280]  That's not additional 134, that's a multiply of 134, because we're not including the vector
[1:17:03.280 --> 1:17:07.720]  of the airplane, where there's another 20 people who take care of the airplane, the
[1:17:07.720 --> 1:17:09.320]  waiting room, and all that.
[1:17:09.320 --> 1:17:15.240]  So what we have is an increasingly exponential epidemic that has to be prepared for, and
[1:17:15.240 --> 1:17:20.240]  the CDC was not prepared, was not able to contain it, and neither was unfortunately
[1:17:20.240 --> 1:17:26.080]  your hospital in Dallas, which I was absolutely shocked, because of all the states in the
[1:17:26.080 --> 1:17:30.560]  Union, I would have assumed that Texas could have handled this problem, and they have not
[1:17:30.560 --> 1:17:31.560]  been able.
[1:17:31.560 --> 1:17:32.560]  I'm sorry about that.
[1:17:32.560 --> 1:17:34.920]  I've waited around for the CDC to tell them what to do.
[1:17:34.920 --> 1:17:39.760]  It shows how total federalization with this bureaucracy has just turned everybody into
[1:17:39.760 --> 1:17:40.760]  jellyfish.
[1:17:40.760 --> 1:17:47.080]  They've been at, well, honestly, with all, well, CDC, everybody knows who has to deal
[1:17:47.080 --> 1:17:52.640]  with the CDC, which was a totally ineffective dysfunctional organization for 20 to 30 years.
[1:17:52.640 --> 1:17:57.120]  They are not the primary units that go into a epidemic.
[1:17:57.120 --> 1:18:00.880]  The primary units that I would use would always be the military or the paramilitary
[1:18:00.880 --> 1:18:06.520]  units of the public elsewhere, but the CDC was only a consulting body that basically
[1:18:06.520 --> 1:18:12.760]  could give information to your local hospital, to your county, and your county commissioner
[1:18:12.760 --> 1:18:19.240]  or your governor could rescind that recommendation, and clearly Presbyterian Hospital was not
[1:18:19.240 --> 1:18:23.400]  prepared, nor were they helpful in assessing the situation.
[1:18:23.400 --> 1:18:28.080]  Well, Dr. Bachanik, I just read the default laws and regulations.
[1:18:28.080 --> 1:18:37.560]  Weren't they supposed to direct Ebola patients to special quarantine bio shield federal facilities
[1:18:37.560 --> 1:18:39.760]  where they now are starting to direct them?
[1:18:39.760 --> 1:18:42.680]  Why did they allow them into hospitals?
[1:18:42.680 --> 1:18:44.000]  I have no idea.
[1:18:44.000 --> 1:18:48.200]  They should have been evaluated a long time ago because this was an issue that's been
[1:18:48.200 --> 1:18:50.400]  around since 1976.
[1:18:50.400 --> 1:18:54.760]  We knew about the Ebola epidemic already over a year ago in Liberia.
[1:18:54.760 --> 1:19:00.000]  I'd been waiting for it, and that's why the military had been on standby, and they went
[1:19:00.000 --> 1:19:01.000]  in there.
[1:19:01.000 --> 1:19:03.440]  But in fact, there are only four hospitals.
[1:19:03.440 --> 1:19:08.280]  One is in Missoula, Montana, where I used to live in Montana in Bosnia, but those four
[1:19:08.280 --> 1:19:14.960]  hospitals did not contain the number of Ebola patients that will overwhelm the system.
[1:19:14.960 --> 1:19:21.480]  In terms of the preparatory status, it was the CDC that claimed every hospital was ready
[1:19:21.480 --> 1:19:23.520]  and Obama claimed it, and that was false.
[1:19:23.520 --> 1:19:27.760]  So you're thinking, I'm about to skip this network break because this subject is so important.
[1:19:27.760 --> 1:19:30.660]  Doc, I mean, you believe Sandy Hook was staged.
[1:19:30.660 --> 1:19:33.400]  More and more experts have come out and agreed.
[1:19:33.400 --> 1:19:35.840]  The Boston bombing rigged.
[1:19:35.840 --> 1:19:43.120]  So many other events, 9-11, the open funding of ISIS, changing the name from Al Qaeda.
[1:19:43.120 --> 1:19:45.040]  All of this is coming out.
[1:19:45.040 --> 1:19:49.040]  But when you look at this Ebola situation, I'm not saying it's not ravaging Africa.
[1:19:49.040 --> 1:19:55.280]  I'm not saying it isn't living in the body longer before the symptoms show up 21 days
[1:19:55.280 --> 1:19:56.280]  instead of three.
[1:19:56.280 --> 1:19:59.040]  It's clearly mutating, getting stronger.
[1:19:59.040 --> 1:20:04.680]  But it just, I can't believe that this type of ineptitude to bring in Ebola patients,
[1:20:04.680 --> 1:20:11.560]  they never did that before, to let people fly in from West Africa, from ravaged areas
[1:20:11.560 --> 1:20:14.120]  when other countries had already banned it months ago.
[1:20:14.120 --> 1:20:21.280]  I mean, it appears that ineptitude wouldn't be this precise at doing everything they could
[1:20:21.280 --> 1:20:24.320]  to grease the skids for Ebola.
[1:20:24.320 --> 1:20:29.480]  Are you getting any information on them allowing this to spread, to kind of bring in a medical
[1:20:29.480 --> 1:20:31.840]  tyranny to create a political distraction?
[1:20:31.840 --> 1:20:34.360]  Are there any motives for this to be a false flag?
[1:20:34.360 --> 1:20:40.080]  No, not really, because number one, it is very hard to create an epidemic to create
[1:20:40.080 --> 1:20:41.080]  a false flag.
[1:20:41.080 --> 1:20:47.280]  Newtown was a false flag because Eric Holder had funded a very dysfunctional governor in
[1:20:47.280 --> 1:20:53.240]  a dysfunctional town and a bunch of Connecticut state troopers who were just pathetic.
[1:20:53.240 --> 1:20:56.040]  And it was easy to create, and the scenario was nonsense.
[1:20:56.040 --> 1:20:58.000]  This is somewhat different.
[1:20:58.000 --> 1:21:03.280]  We've seen Ebola, and the doctors without borders have been dealing with it for decades.
[1:21:03.280 --> 1:21:08.160]  The problem is that really the ineptitude and the fact that they're coming into Liberia
[1:21:08.160 --> 1:21:14.920]  has more to do with money superseding the ability of the U.S. government to cease and
[1:21:14.920 --> 1:21:15.920]  desist.
[1:21:15.920 --> 1:21:19.000]  In other words, United Airlines refuses to stop flying.
[1:21:19.000 --> 1:21:23.480]  In particular, Belgium and Air France stops flying because they make money.
[1:21:23.480 --> 1:21:28.440]  They don't want to stop their plane from flying into Liberia and Sierra Leone.
[1:21:28.440 --> 1:21:31.040]  I would put a quarantine zone immediately.
[1:21:31.040 --> 1:21:36.080]  That's why I would hope that our U.S. military would impose what's called a quarantine or
[1:21:36.080 --> 1:21:38.240]  what's called don't sign a deal.
[1:21:38.240 --> 1:21:43.920]  I really don't care at this point that Liberians come to the United States because any Liberian
[1:21:43.920 --> 1:21:48.880]  like Mr. Duncan is coming to the United States for only one purpose, not his medical care.
[1:21:48.880 --> 1:21:53.120]  He knew very well the minute he came in here that he was infected.
[1:21:53.120 --> 1:21:56.320]  And in turn, he didn't really care whether he infected everybody else.
[1:21:56.320 --> 1:22:00.960]  The notion that the symptoms don't come out to 21, that's absurd.
[1:22:00.960 --> 1:22:06.280]  And Frieden knows that's absurd because this virus, like the AIDS virus, which by the way,
[1:22:06.280 --> 1:22:10.560]  the CDC could not handle, that's why this is a history of incompetency on the behalf
[1:22:10.560 --> 1:22:14.280]  of HHS, CDC, the president.
[1:22:14.280 --> 1:22:18.360]  These are incompetent institutions that have been funded and incorrect, you don't want
[1:22:18.360 --> 1:22:19.360]  to pay for them.
[1:22:19.360 --> 1:22:20.960]  They could not handle AIDS.
[1:22:20.960 --> 1:22:27.640]  Ebola, like AIDS, is an RNA virus which is highly dangerous and mutates very quickly.
[1:22:27.640 --> 1:22:32.800]  So immediately that we find a vaccine like we did on AIDS, that will mutate.
[1:22:32.800 --> 1:22:35.880]  It'll change so rapidly that it took us years.
[1:22:35.880 --> 1:22:40.760]  And Tony Fauci is National Institute of Infectious Disease to be able to contain it.
[1:22:40.760 --> 1:22:45.000]  Now, having said all this, you can't create a massive panic.
[1:22:45.000 --> 1:22:49.280]  On the same hand, you can't use this for some type of political correctness.
[1:22:49.280 --> 1:22:50.800]  I would create a quarantine.
[1:22:50.800 --> 1:22:54.560]  I would not allow any flights from, let's say, Sierra Leone, Liberia.
[1:22:54.560 --> 1:22:57.600]  I would let our AFRICOM handle the situation there.
[1:22:57.600 --> 1:23:02.440]  I would close off off-flight and then make sure all hospitals were prepared because we're
[1:23:02.440 --> 1:23:06.840]  now in the flu season, which means that everybody who's going to go into the hospital of the
[1:23:06.840 --> 1:23:12.040]  emergency room is going to come in with symptoms of fever, headaches, nausea, and the doctors
[1:23:12.040 --> 1:23:17.920]  have to be prepared, as well as the nurses, to know the difference between Ebola and the
[1:23:17.920 --> 1:23:18.920]  flu.
[1:23:18.920 --> 1:23:20.200]  And that's going to be a problem.
[1:23:20.200 --> 1:23:24.880]  But having said that, I have full faith that somehow America comes out of it, that's my
[1:23:24.880 --> 1:23:25.880]  wishful thinking.
[1:23:25.880 --> 1:23:26.880]  Well, sure.
[1:23:26.880 --> 1:23:27.880]  Sure.
[1:23:27.880 --> 1:23:28.880]  Sure.
[1:23:28.880 --> 1:23:36.400]  As a medical doctor, Dr. Pachanic, who's been all over the world and taught NBC-type classes
[1:23:36.400 --> 1:23:40.120]  and things I know in the military, when you were in the military previously, what does
[1:23:40.120 --> 1:23:41.400]  your gut tell you?
[1:23:41.400 --> 1:23:48.080]  I'm no epidemiologist, I'm not a virologist, but if you've got people flying who are infectious,
[1:23:48.080 --> 1:23:55.080]  if you've got other Africans being issued visas to come in here from West Africa, undoubtedly
[1:23:55.080 --> 1:23:59.440]  there are probably going to be hundreds of people now that end up coming down with Ebola.
[1:23:59.440 --> 1:24:02.560]  And if they don't immediately contain them, it'll be thousands.
[1:24:02.560 --> 1:24:06.600]  I think there's a pretty good chance we're going to end up with some type of epidemic.
[1:24:06.600 --> 1:24:10.480]  Do you disagree with that, or what's your gut tell you?
[1:24:10.480 --> 1:24:15.560]  We are in the incipient phases, the beginning phases of an epidemic.
[1:24:15.560 --> 1:24:21.600]  Here an epidemic, it initiates at one point, it's started with one man, spread to two people,
[1:24:21.600 --> 1:24:26.120]  then you have 130 on a plane, you have another couple of hundred on other planes.
[1:24:26.120 --> 1:24:28.560]  So this is going to be spread very quickly.
[1:24:28.560 --> 1:24:33.680]  Now if you were to ask me which city in the United States would have had an Ebola population,
[1:24:33.680 --> 1:24:36.400]  I would not have guessed Dallas.
[1:24:36.400 --> 1:24:41.200]  I would have said New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, and it wouldn't take very hard for
[1:24:41.200 --> 1:24:46.720]  me to place a Liberian or Sierra Leonean on a plane to go to any one of those cities
[1:24:46.720 --> 1:24:49.920]  and to create an epidemic of Ebola.
[1:24:49.920 --> 1:24:54.960]  So the council officers in the State Department have to cease and desist giving visas.
[1:24:54.960 --> 1:24:57.200]  I think there has to be a quarantine.
[1:24:57.200 --> 1:25:02.400]  The notion that customs officials can put up this nonsense, temperature, engage it and
[1:25:02.400 --> 1:25:07.480]  say that they don't have Ebola or that Ebola only comes out when there's a fever and they're
[1:25:07.480 --> 1:25:09.880]  sweating, that's absolute nonsense.
[1:25:09.880 --> 1:25:15.400]  With an RNA virus, we know it transmits very quickly and if Dr. Frieden knows differently
[1:25:15.400 --> 1:25:19.640]  and he says it differently, he has no idea of molecular biology, which he didn't know
[1:25:19.640 --> 1:25:23.400]  about in HIV, which is also an RNA virus.
[1:25:23.400 --> 1:25:30.040]  Sure, they said it was anti-gay to want to quarantine people in 1979, 1981.
[1:25:30.040 --> 1:25:34.560]  If they would have done that, we wouldn't have millions of Americans dying from AIDS.
[1:25:34.560 --> 1:25:39.360]  Correct, and that was the fault of the CDC and they had no idea of what they were talking
[1:25:39.360 --> 1:25:40.360]  about.
[1:25:40.360 --> 1:25:43.840]  And now we're against West Africans if we don't want Ebola, so I guess like we have
[1:25:43.840 --> 1:25:49.720]  bug chasers that want to get HIV, maybe to prove you're politically correct, maybe young
[1:25:49.720 --> 1:25:53.080]  women should go out and ask librarians to give them Ebola.
[1:25:53.080 --> 1:25:55.960]  No, no, no, no, let's not get too fast.
[1:25:55.960 --> 1:25:58.160]  The issue is it's really quite simple.
[1:25:58.160 --> 1:26:03.040]  We have an effective military, we have the right constitutionally to both quarantine
[1:26:03.040 --> 1:26:04.320]  at any point we want.
[1:26:04.320 --> 1:26:09.560]  We actually, in fact, did that, Alex, in the 1900s when we had immigrants coming in from
[1:26:09.560 --> 1:26:15.000]  all over the world, we had the public health service, the military being able to sequester
[1:26:15.000 --> 1:26:20.560]  immigrants coming in, put them on Ellis Island for four to five weeks with all kinds of diseases,
[1:26:20.560 --> 1:26:27.640]  chile, cholera, typhus, smallpox, chickenpox, and then by the time they exhibited and manifested
[1:26:27.640 --> 1:26:33.400]  the symptoms on Ellis Island, they were then allowed to come back into the United States.
[1:26:33.400 --> 1:26:37.000]  Made total sense, but nowadays that would be called homophobic or racist.
[1:26:37.000 --> 1:26:41.680]  We should accept all of the Ebola patients, and if other countries are all banning people
[1:26:41.680 --> 1:26:47.680]  from West Africa, the U.S. will become the repository of everyone fleeing, and then I
[1:26:47.680 --> 1:26:52.560]  think it's a guarantee that we're going to get an Ebola pandemic out of the epidemic.
[1:26:52.560 --> 1:26:59.440]  If this continues, how do you think the CDC and Obama and others are thinking they're
[1:26:59.440 --> 1:27:05.080]  going to get away with their clear stand down, whether it was from incompetence or on purpose,
[1:27:05.080 --> 1:27:06.480]  it doesn't really matter.
[1:27:06.480 --> 1:27:09.160]  It's criminal negligence in my view, Dr. Pachennick.
[1:27:09.160 --> 1:27:10.960]  I don't know what they're thinking.
[1:27:10.960 --> 1:27:15.400]  I mean, if you're right that they're really this inept, and I've talked to senior secret
[1:27:15.400 --> 1:27:19.280]  service folks, I'll just leave it at that, that have been inside, not just Bongino, but
[1:27:19.280 --> 1:27:26.400]  other people in person, not over any telecommunications, and they tell me that they can't tell me what's
[1:27:26.400 --> 1:27:30.720]  going on in the White House, but they say it is over the top.
[1:27:30.720 --> 1:27:35.040]  And then they point out what that FBI agent said he saw in the White House when Clinton
[1:27:35.040 --> 1:27:38.400]  was there, and they said 10 times worse than that.
[1:27:38.400 --> 1:27:41.520]  Well, the stuff that he brought out was over the top.
[1:27:41.520 --> 1:27:48.160]  I mean, it sounds to me like Obama and his controllers literally are watching Sports
[1:27:48.160 --> 1:27:52.520]  Center and playing golf all day, and so who is running the country, Dr. Pachennick?
[1:27:52.520 --> 1:27:53.520]  No one.
[1:27:53.520 --> 1:27:58.040]  And I've said it from day one, remember, when I first went on your show and I said there
[1:27:58.040 --> 1:28:02.320]  was going to be a stand-down in Newtown, that he didn't kill Osama bin Laden because bin
[1:28:02.320 --> 1:28:07.720]  Laden's been dead for 10 years, I questioned the credibility and the effectiveness of Obama.
[1:28:07.720 --> 1:28:11.680]  I still maintain that the man should never have been president, he's not qualified to
[1:28:11.680 --> 1:28:17.080]  be president, and he should resign, and we should have someone else take over.
[1:28:17.080 --> 1:28:22.400]  That issue is standing right now, it depends on the American public, on Congress, but we
[1:28:22.400 --> 1:28:26.560]  have had an ineffectual congress, so what happens in return?
[1:28:26.560 --> 1:28:33.280]  Our military has the right and has appropriately acted to take over some of the functions that
[1:28:33.280 --> 1:28:39.680]  the president of the United States has mismanaged, ISIS, a complete creation of the CIA and our
[1:28:39.680 --> 1:28:45.040]  civilian capacity to create wars that we eventually fight against ourselves.
[1:28:45.040 --> 1:28:50.600]  I said it in a blog where we're now ending up, where ISIS will end up in Baghdad, although
[1:28:50.600 --> 1:28:54.320]  some of the military disagree with me, they're on the outskirts of Baghdad.
[1:28:54.320 --> 1:29:02.840]  It reminds me of 35 years ago when I was ordered by the Nixon administration to debrief Ambassador
[1:29:02.840 --> 1:29:09.240]  Martin in the evacuation of Saigon, and so we have created the monster, like CIA created
[1:29:09.240 --> 1:29:14.760]  the Vietnam, the Khang, and then eventually the military had to go in and we lost the
[1:29:14.760 --> 1:29:15.760]  war.
[1:29:15.760 --> 1:29:16.760]  We've lost another war.
[1:29:16.760 --> 1:29:19.240]  We've lost wars after wars after wars.
[1:29:19.240 --> 1:29:25.080]  It's not just Obama who's incompetent, Bush Jr., Clinton, so the question is, what does
[1:29:25.080 --> 1:29:28.200]  America want and what is it willing to fight for?
[1:29:28.200 --> 1:29:33.400]  We can complain as much as we want, but from day one, when you and I got together 12 years
[1:29:33.400 --> 1:29:38.840]  ago and I've always respected your courage, your bravery, and some of us call us out the
[1:29:38.840 --> 1:29:43.280]  outlier and I don't particularly care what they say, everything you and I have said has
[1:29:43.280 --> 1:29:44.280]  come out true.
[1:29:44.280 --> 1:29:45.280]  It really has.
[1:29:45.280 --> 1:29:48.840]  Dr. Vicenic Stether, I want to finish up on the economy, on North Korea and Russia.
[1:29:48.840 --> 1:29:49.840]  Stay with us.
[1:29:49.840 --> 1:29:50.840]  Stay here on the march.
[1:29:50.840 --> 1:29:51.840]  Stay with us.
[1:29:51.840 --> 1:29:52.840]  The empires on the run.
[1:29:52.840 --> 1:30:22.800]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[1:30:59.880 --> 1:31:01.360]  The experts are clear.
[1:31:01.360 --> 1:31:07.000]  Sunlight, purified water, healthy non-GMO food, and having a good attitude is essential to
[1:31:07.000 --> 1:31:08.000]  a healthy immune system.
[1:31:08.000 --> 1:31:13.160]  But I go further with Super nascent iodine x2 from infowarseline.com.
[1:31:13.160 --> 1:31:19.440]  50% stronger than our original and revolutionary nascent iodine formula, coming from a deep
[1:31:19.440 --> 1:31:22.720]  earth crystal source that no other supplier has.
[1:31:22.720 --> 1:31:27.960]  Most other forms of iodine come from seaweed in areas plagued by Fukushima and other contaminants.
[1:31:27.960 --> 1:31:28.960]  Not our iodine.
[1:31:28.960 --> 1:31:34.160]  It comes from over 200 million year old crystal salt deposits and is tested and proven to
[1:31:34.160 --> 1:31:35.160]  be completely pure.

[1:32:06.920 --> 1:32:11.680]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[1:32:11.680 --> 1:32:20.640]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[1:32:20.640 --> 1:32:29.040]  They so pride in every stitch, guarantee you love the way they fit.
[1:32:29.040 --> 1:32:33.840]  They put a diamond gusset in the crotch where you need it most.
[1:32:33.840 --> 1:32:38.800]  Blue diamond gussets got it, others don't.
[1:32:38.800 --> 1:32:45.600]  We turn jeans inside out, diamond gusset jeans, made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[1:32:45.600 --> 1:32:50.160]  Our Defender motorcycle jeans combine gusset comfort with Kevlar protection so you can
[1:32:50.160 --> 1:32:52.320]  ride all day with confidence.
[1:32:52.320 --> 1:33:06.560]  Order yours at gusset.com, diamond gusset jeans got it, others don't.
[1:33:06.560 --> 1:33:19.040]  Live from the infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[1:33:19.040 --> 1:33:26.160]  All I want is to have a safe and secure constitutional republic not overrun by criminal bureaucracies,
[1:33:26.160 --> 1:33:31.000]  agencies, and foreign corporations that would suppress the free market and private property
[1:33:31.000 --> 1:33:35.360]  rights and religious rights and cultural rights because it gets in the way of their
[1:33:35.360 --> 1:33:37.560]  business models.
[1:33:37.560 --> 1:33:43.200]  We're looking at a worldwide fascist model using socialism to domesticate the population.
[1:33:43.200 --> 1:33:46.840]  That's the real political science angle.
[1:33:46.840 --> 1:33:51.080]  When you read Carol Quigley's books and other globalists, they admit that.
[1:33:51.080 --> 1:33:54.120]  They want totalitarianism.
[1:33:54.120 --> 1:33:56.400]  They don't want a free market.
[1:33:56.400 --> 1:33:57.740]  They don't want prosperity.
[1:33:57.740 --> 1:33:59.800]  They don't want you to be successful.
[1:33:59.800 --> 1:34:05.480]  They're the opposite of americana, the opposite of renaissance, the opposite of freedom, and
[1:34:05.480 --> 1:34:10.520]  Joel Gilbert, we were the number one seller of his last film that we still sell, Dreams
[1:34:10.520 --> 1:34:15.520]  of Obama's Real Father, that if you haven't seen it, it's just unbelievable.
[1:34:15.520 --> 1:34:20.880]  My parents said it was one of the most powerful documentaries I ever saw.
[1:34:20.880 --> 1:34:23.360]  They thought it was preposterous what he was saying when they heard him on air, but my
[1:34:23.360 --> 1:34:26.360]  dad came by and got one of them and went home and watched it last year or two years ago
[1:34:26.360 --> 1:34:27.960]  when it came out and was blown away.
[1:34:27.960 --> 1:34:32.360]  Well, There's No Place Like Utopia is his new film that had a successful theater run.
[1:34:32.360 --> 1:34:38.280]  It comes out officially next month right for the midterm elections, but we have it first
[1:34:38.280 --> 1:34:39.280]  in stock.
[1:34:39.280 --> 1:34:40.360]  Came in a few days ago.
[1:34:40.360 --> 1:34:41.760]  We are the exclusive.
[1:34:41.760 --> 1:34:42.760]  He just gave it to us.
[1:34:42.760 --> 1:34:43.760]  He said, you know what?
[1:34:43.760 --> 1:34:47.120]  You were such a big number one seller of it last time.
[1:34:47.120 --> 1:34:52.120]  I'm going to give it to you first to sell with pre-orders, but it's not a pre-order.
[1:34:52.120 --> 1:34:53.120]  We're shipping it now.
[1:34:53.120 --> 1:34:54.360]  We're authorized to.
[1:34:54.360 --> 1:34:55.680]  He's on next week.
[1:34:55.680 --> 1:34:58.480]  So there's no place like utopia on the cover.
[1:34:58.480 --> 1:35:02.080]  It's got Obama looking at the public with an American flag in his hand and a hammer
[1:35:02.080 --> 1:35:04.240]  and sickle to his back.
[1:35:04.240 --> 1:35:06.280]  And it's great to show young people.
[1:35:06.280 --> 1:35:08.160]  Great to show progressives.
[1:35:08.160 --> 1:35:10.720]  Great to show mainline conservatives, libertarians.
[1:35:10.720 --> 1:35:14.680]  It just, it's kind of like Dinesh D'Souza's new film that they put him in prison over
[1:35:14.680 --> 1:35:18.000]  or basically arrested him over.
[1:35:18.000 --> 1:35:24.120]  He's in a halfway house right now, but it's much more hardcore and it needs to be seen.
[1:35:24.120 --> 1:35:31.560]  So it's available exclusively at infowarstore.com and we're not like NPR that gets 400 plus
[1:35:31.560 --> 1:35:34.400]  million attached pair of money a year and then begs for money locally.
[1:35:34.400 --> 1:35:38.560]  We just show high quality products, films, books, t-shirts, supplements, water filtration
[1:35:38.560 --> 1:35:45.160]  systems, made in America knives, stuff that I like stuff I use.
[1:35:45.160 --> 1:35:49.920]  I mean, I'll go out and use a little cook stove that I buy for camping and I really like
[1:35:49.920 --> 1:35:50.920]  this cook stove.
[1:35:50.920 --> 1:35:54.600]  There's five, 5,000 of them and we can sell at the lowest price out there.
[1:35:54.600 --> 1:35:57.200]  Or I like this dash cam.
[1:35:57.200 --> 1:36:00.760]  Get us a deal with these and buy 10,000 of them and get me the lowest price available
[1:36:00.760 --> 1:36:04.000]  and we'll even undercut Amazon.
[1:36:04.000 --> 1:36:10.400]  That's what you've got at infowarstore.com is true free market.
[1:36:10.400 --> 1:36:14.040]  That's why we're able to sell you this film first because we sold the most of it.
[1:36:14.040 --> 1:36:16.400]  Yeah, where's Amazon right now?
[1:36:16.400 --> 1:36:20.880]  Sorry, unable to have it because we're even defeating them in our own little microbe.
[1:36:20.880 --> 1:36:22.320]  Microcosm with the free market.
[1:36:22.320 --> 1:36:23.800]  It's a wondrous thing.
[1:36:23.800 --> 1:36:29.640]  So get, there's no place like Utopia, Joel Gilbert film available at infowarstore.com
[1:36:29.640 --> 1:36:37.480]  or 888-253-3139 and a subdivision of infowarstore.com is infowarstalife.com.
[1:36:37.480 --> 1:36:47.120]  We have the DNA force that Dr. Group and others say with the CoQ-10 systematic enzymes and
[1:36:47.120 --> 1:36:54.480]  the astrologist root and the bio-enhanced palm-granted extract, Tibetan extracts, just
[1:36:54.480 --> 1:37:02.440]  a whole bunch of key things in there, veganzyme, bio-PQQ, the true organic sources of this.
[1:37:02.440 --> 1:37:06.320]  We can even make claims about this stuff but it's all been vetted by the lawyers and the
[1:37:06.320 --> 1:37:09.720]  rest of it at infowarstalife.com.
[1:37:09.720 --> 1:37:16.320]  What's patented, trademarked, certified, proven in DNA force, a true nutraceutical.
[1:37:16.320 --> 1:37:23.600]  What it does for the telomeres, what it does for the mitochondrial DNA, what it does for
[1:37:23.600 --> 1:37:25.600]  everything and the immune system.
[1:37:25.600 --> 1:37:31.160]  DNA force isn't the only place I stopped for my immune system and bolstering my natural
[1:37:31.160 --> 1:37:32.160]  defenses.
[1:37:32.160 --> 1:37:37.280]  We have the X2 true, deep earth crystal source that nobody else has, nascent iodine that
[1:37:37.280 --> 1:37:40.200]  just supercharges my body across the board.
[1:37:40.200 --> 1:37:42.600]  So many people are deficient.
[1:37:42.600 --> 1:37:45.800]  The FDA's lowered what the allowance is to almost nothing.
[1:37:45.800 --> 1:37:48.800]  Well, I take survival shield three times a day.
[1:37:48.800 --> 1:37:53.560]  Super male vitality, super female vitality, the lung cleanse.
[1:37:53.560 --> 1:37:59.160]  Other herbal stuff for the throat and lungs is just watery crud, folks.
[1:37:59.160 --> 1:38:00.680]  This is like thick oil.
[1:38:00.680 --> 1:38:04.400]  The only problem is you've got to clean out the spray bottle top sometimes after you've
[1:38:04.400 --> 1:38:06.960]  been using it because it's so thick.
[1:38:06.960 --> 1:38:11.160]  It aerosolizes really good when it's new because you've got to clean it out because it's just
[1:38:11.160 --> 1:38:16.520]  a whole bunch of organic concentrated herbs that are known for your health and known for
[1:38:16.520 --> 1:38:18.960]  cleansing and known for the immune system.
[1:38:18.960 --> 1:38:20.080]  So get the lung cleanse.
[1:38:20.080 --> 1:38:21.960]  Great when you're traveling on airplanes.
[1:38:21.960 --> 1:38:22.960]  You name it.
[1:38:22.960 --> 1:38:23.960]  Great for singers.

[1:39:32.360 --> 1:39:37.260]  We're going to tweet your website out again right now at Real Alex Jones for folks to
[1:39:37.260 --> 1:39:40.560]  get the inside take from your perspective on what's happening.
[1:39:40.560 --> 1:39:46.760]  In the 12 minutes we've got left before break, I want to give you the floor to break down
[1:39:46.760 --> 1:39:50.000]  more on ISIS, where Obama's going.
[1:39:50.000 --> 1:39:51.480]  We are seeing a global awakening.
[1:39:51.480 --> 1:39:53.200]  Is it happening fast enough?
[1:39:53.200 --> 1:39:56.760]  What do you think the political class is going to do?
[1:39:56.760 --> 1:39:58.520]  What's happening with Russia?
[1:39:58.520 --> 1:40:04.320]  What's happening with the runs on the stock markets worldwide, with the implosion on
[1:40:04.320 --> 1:40:06.400]  the U.S. Treasuries?
[1:40:06.400 --> 1:40:08.400]  What is this signifying, Dr. Pochennick?
[1:40:08.400 --> 1:40:11.960]  Well, let me just say thank you for the opportunity.
[1:40:11.960 --> 1:40:18.680]  Let me just say the good news is that our intelligence and military apparatus has effectively
[1:40:18.680 --> 1:40:25.800]  won a very effective and sophisticated economic warfare against Russia.
[1:40:25.800 --> 1:40:32.440]  What was done was basically we lowered the value of the ruble by 30% to 40%.
[1:40:32.440 --> 1:40:39.480]  We decreased Russia's bond rating, and now that the price of oil was literally depressed
[1:40:39.480 --> 1:40:44.320]  by $20 to $30 on Brent oil prices, which is now $82.
[1:40:44.320 --> 1:40:49.320]  Anything below $90 per barrel would put Putin in very serious trouble in Russia.
[1:40:49.320 --> 1:40:54.280]  Now, Russia has the worst stock market in the world now.
[1:40:54.280 --> 1:40:58.640]  Putin has to return from the border.
[1:40:58.640 --> 1:41:01.480]  He's pulling back at soldiers.
[1:41:01.480 --> 1:41:06.480]  From an economic, from a battle point of view, we've really created a new kind of warfare,
[1:41:06.480 --> 1:41:10.280]  which has been very effective, and that's economic warfare.
[1:41:10.280 --> 1:41:15.480]  You can thank the military and the intelligence community for effectively running it for well
[1:41:15.480 --> 1:41:19.200]  over a year and quietly succeeding.
[1:41:19.200 --> 1:41:25.080]  Putin has nothing to be basically now very vulnerable to be taken over, where there's
[1:41:25.080 --> 1:41:32.000]  possibly another KGP push in the Kremlin or FSB or whoever might be there, but basically
[1:41:32.000 --> 1:41:35.680]  Putin has failed, Russia has failed.
[1:41:35.680 --> 1:41:42.680]  Concomitantly, China is a very serious economic problem, and what you're seeing in Hong Kong
[1:41:42.680 --> 1:41:50.080]  is that China has lowered its growth rate, which was absolutely evaluated at a very
[1:41:50.080 --> 1:41:57.200]  high number at 6% to 7% normally, or 12%, so basically what it is right now, 3%, which
[1:41:57.200 --> 1:42:02.800]  in effect for 1.5 billion people means that there's no growth in China.
[1:42:02.800 --> 1:42:08.240]  China had a very serious problem where they now have spent hundreds of billions of dollars,
[1:42:08.240 --> 1:42:15.080]  and I think President Xi, Xi, has made a very serious mistake economically to invest
[1:42:15.080 --> 1:42:21.480]  that 100 billion into basically four banks, which will fund a very speculative real estate
[1:42:21.480 --> 1:42:24.360]  market in China, which is about to collapse.
[1:42:24.360 --> 1:42:31.160]  So China is now in a deflationary, in a depressive mood, Russia is in a depressive mood, and
[1:42:31.160 --> 1:42:33.960]  now we get to the issue of what you have always said.
[1:42:33.960 --> 1:42:36.600]  We've talked about socialism does not work.
[1:42:36.600 --> 1:42:43.880]  The proof of the pudding is, EU is completely depleted and heading into a serious economic
[1:42:43.880 --> 1:42:48.800]  depression, and hopefully, from my point of view, will break up.
[1:42:48.800 --> 1:42:56.440]  EU was never intended to be coagulated into one unit or completed into one unit because
[1:42:56.440 --> 1:43:02.960]  it was a very poor attempt by France to control German economy, and the Germans as usual came
[1:43:02.960 --> 1:43:10.680]  out of this economic malaise with force, figure, and technology, and therefore France, as
[1:43:10.680 --> 1:43:14.480]  defaulted, France's rating, bond rating will go down.
[1:43:14.480 --> 1:43:20.360]  Hollandei will probably be thrown out and planted by Sarkozy, but France is now in
[1:43:20.360 --> 1:43:21.360]  the freefall.
[1:43:21.360 --> 1:43:28.160]  The euro is falling to 1.25, and they go down to 1.15 and 1.0 against the dollar.
[1:43:28.160 --> 1:43:34.760]  Spain, Italy, Portugal, France, and the rest of the European countries have a very serious
[1:43:34.760 --> 1:43:42.760]  unemployment rate collectively of over 25 percent, and the age is between 15 to 28 and
[1:43:42.760 --> 1:43:43.760]  29.
[1:43:43.760 --> 1:43:47.240]  That's the working age, and they cannot provide work.
[1:43:47.240 --> 1:43:53.720]  So socialism and the healthcare system have not been effective in all of Europe, and therefore
[1:43:53.720 --> 1:43:59.440]  each country now has to decide whether they want to abide by the austerity plan or not.
[1:43:59.440 --> 1:44:04.560]  My suspicion is that eventually unemployment will be the key factor for the breakup of
[1:44:04.560 --> 1:44:05.560]  Europe.
[1:44:05.560 --> 1:44:11.080]  There was no reason to have a super European council which had no meaning whatsoever, led
[1:44:11.080 --> 1:44:16.600]  by Italians who can't even run their own country, and as a country which is in bankruptcy.
[1:44:16.600 --> 1:44:22.800]  So from an economic point of view, even though America has had a depression and a stock market
[1:44:22.800 --> 1:44:26.640]  that went down three to four, six, five hundred points, it will rebound.
[1:44:26.640 --> 1:44:31.320]  In my opinion, the most important thing that happened from an economic point of view that
[1:44:31.320 --> 1:44:36.360]  was good news on behalf of America was something that was not covered, and that was one of
[1:44:36.360 --> 1:44:43.760]  the tankers that came out of Texas, your great state, was a Singaporean tanker containing
[1:44:43.760 --> 1:44:45.360]  our gas and oil.
[1:44:45.360 --> 1:44:52.480]  That means that last week, America is now completely one hundred percent free of any
[1:44:52.480 --> 1:44:55.600]  external need for gas or oil.
[1:44:55.600 --> 1:45:01.160]  We are shifting away from oil, that means your oil companies in Texas will not do well.
[1:45:01.160 --> 1:45:02.480]  They know that.
[1:45:02.480 --> 1:45:08.840]  And instead, the gas companies will increase in capability and capacity, and we are now
[1:45:08.840 --> 1:45:16.920]  a net exporter of gas and oil from all countries in the world, so we are self-sufficient economically.
[1:45:16.920 --> 1:45:21.560]  Even though we don't look as if we're doing well right now, we will rebound for the simple
[1:45:21.560 --> 1:45:26.840]  reason that you and I have always said, we are an entrepreneurial country where we can
[1:45:26.840 --> 1:45:32.000]  turn around on a dime, we can create a business in four days or four hours.
[1:45:32.000 --> 1:45:36.840]  And as you said, even though we have to pay the taxes or we can avoid the taxes, we know
[1:45:36.840 --> 1:45:41.800]  how to create businesses, which is very similar from the rest of the world.
[1:45:41.800 --> 1:45:45.640]  So, from that point of view, we are doing very well.
[1:45:45.640 --> 1:45:48.480]  We will rebound on the stock market.
[1:45:48.480 --> 1:45:50.520]  It is needed a correction.
[1:45:50.520 --> 1:45:54.600]  Actually the next two weeks will be the most important two weeks where we will see that
[1:45:54.600 --> 1:45:58.360]  rebounding element, and it will come into a new segment.
[1:45:58.360 --> 1:46:03.120]  Oil and gas and energy will no longer be the primary drivers of our economy.
[1:46:03.120 --> 1:46:10.240]  Energy will probably be the game-changers like innovation, e-systems, or anything dealing
[1:46:10.240 --> 1:46:12.800]  with the internet and information capacity.
[1:46:12.800 --> 1:46:16.240]  All right, let me just stop you for just a moment, because oil exploration is at all
[1:46:16.240 --> 1:46:20.840]  time highs here in the U.S. as you know, we're the number one producer and exporter now
[1:46:20.840 --> 1:46:27.240]  in the world that only seems to be gearing up, so I don't understand your perspective
[1:46:27.240 --> 1:46:30.080]  there on that won't be central anymore.
[1:46:30.080 --> 1:46:31.800]  It looks to me like it's getting more central.
[1:46:31.800 --> 1:46:35.720]  I'm not disagreeing with you, I know that we're on the cutting edge of technology, but
[1:46:35.720 --> 1:46:39.960]  it's the overall point that we're doing well, we're doing good.
[1:46:39.960 --> 1:46:43.720]  I get that China is a criminal psychopathic group that's running it.
[1:46:43.720 --> 1:46:48.400]  I get that Russia is a bunch of failed mobsters running it, but it doesn't mean that I agree
[1:46:48.400 --> 1:46:54.400]  with George Soros in their overthrowing Ukraine and starting stuff with Russia to then force
[1:46:54.400 --> 1:46:56.120]  it into an implosion.
[1:46:56.120 --> 1:47:03.160]  It's the worldview that we do well when everybody else does bad, I'd buy into that maybe, at
[1:47:03.160 --> 1:47:06.840]  least intellectually I would understand it, if they weren't trying to shut down the free
[1:47:06.840 --> 1:47:13.840]  market here, jack up taxes here, I would get a predatory view if the super predators didn't
[1:47:13.840 --> 1:47:14.840]  prey on us.
[1:47:14.840 --> 1:47:21.720]  So I don't even buy into there's three power blocks, it's more like globalist feeding and
[1:47:21.720 --> 1:47:28.400]  manipulating like chaos or specter over the whole operation, and I see America losing
[1:47:28.400 --> 1:47:29.400]  the moral high ground.
[1:47:29.400 --> 1:47:34.160]  I mean, I see our military saying no to Obama wanting to back al-Qaeda openly in Syria, but
[1:47:34.160 --> 1:47:37.800]  they still ends up happening just by changing the name.
[1:47:37.800 --> 1:47:41.600]  So whereas I do see a lot of virtue in the military compared to the general public, those
[1:47:41.600 --> 1:47:46.500]  who even know what planet they're on, I see our salvation and destruction, the seeds are
[1:47:46.500 --> 1:47:53.240]  both there, so I get your perspective, they're trying to help U.S. interests by doing all
[1:47:53.240 --> 1:47:57.040]  these things, and it does end up helping us to a certain extent, at least it did in the
[1:47:57.040 --> 1:47:59.600]  past, these were policies for the American people.
[1:47:59.600 --> 1:48:06.520]  Now, I see different elements working against each other more than ever within the Anglo-American
[1:48:06.520 --> 1:48:11.280]  establishment, that's what I'm trying to get at Dr. Pachennick, is that I see America becoming
[1:48:11.280 --> 1:48:14.120]  just as immoral as the Russians or the Chinese.
[1:48:14.120 --> 1:48:18.960]  Well, morality was never the key issue in foreign policy.
[1:48:18.960 --> 1:48:24.360]  What has been the key issue of foreign policy for the United States, Alex, has always been.
[1:48:24.360 --> 1:48:28.280]  We're not interested in friends or enemies, it's what our interests are.
[1:48:28.280 --> 1:48:30.840]  What are the American interests at this particular...
[1:48:30.840 --> 1:48:35.600]  No, I know, but a lot of what our so-called government does flies in the face of our interest.
[1:48:35.600 --> 1:48:36.600]  Whoa, whoa, whoa.
[1:48:36.600 --> 1:48:40.640]  Our American interests have nothing to do with the Middle East, we've been pulling
[1:48:40.640 --> 1:48:46.760]  out of the Middle East, and we have been shifting to Asia because our interest right now is
[1:48:46.760 --> 1:48:49.320]  with the growth and expansion of the Chinese.
[1:48:49.320 --> 1:48:52.560]  Okay, well, let me tell you this, and tell us from your, talk to us like we're five years
[1:48:52.560 --> 1:48:56.280]  old, because I know you've been on the inside.
[1:48:56.280 --> 1:48:58.800]  What are the power blocks in the U.S. right now?
[1:48:58.800 --> 1:49:00.040]  Who's dominant?
[1:49:00.040 --> 1:49:03.400]  Because I see a lot of tug-of-war going on over the levers of power, that's why I think
[1:49:03.400 --> 1:49:07.520]  Obama's paralyzed, but let me correct me if you think I'm wrong.
[1:49:07.520 --> 1:49:09.920]  What are the power blocks?
[1:49:09.920 --> 1:49:15.080]  The power blocks are not the accounts on foreign relations or the Atlantic Council or all the
[1:49:15.080 --> 1:49:16.800]  things that people think about.
[1:49:16.800 --> 1:49:21.760]  The real power blocks in the United States are the same power blocks that's balanced
[1:49:21.760 --> 1:49:24.040]  that came out of a gun.
[1:49:24.040 --> 1:49:29.120]  Whatever comes out of a gun, that firepower is what consists of power.
[1:49:29.120 --> 1:49:35.280]  The firepower that we have in the American military and its capability to span over 220
[1:49:35.280 --> 1:49:39.440]  countries, 730 bases, is very formidable.
[1:49:39.440 --> 1:49:45.320]  Our capability to assess the intelligence capability, to be its failures, and I'm the
[1:49:45.320 --> 1:49:50.120]  first one to even complain about it, is quite formidable.
[1:49:50.120 --> 1:49:53.520]  Those are the two major sui generis power blocks.
[1:49:53.520 --> 1:49:58.440]  The President of the United States is not relevant, absolutely irrelevant, has been
[1:49:58.440 --> 1:50:04.160]  irrelevant for the past 30 years, because the devolution of power, thanks to you and
[1:50:04.160 --> 1:50:06.880]  others, has come to the governors.
[1:50:06.880 --> 1:50:10.760]  The governors of every state have become more and more important.
[1:50:10.760 --> 1:50:13.240]  And they have to start exercising their power.
[1:50:13.240 --> 1:50:19.240]  That's correct, but you have to choose governors who have had experience in managing a huge
[1:50:19.240 --> 1:50:20.240]  system.
[1:50:20.240 --> 1:50:21.240]  We didn't choose that.
[1:50:21.240 --> 1:50:25.520]  We didn't choose the President who knew how to manage large systems.
[1:50:25.520 --> 1:50:30.680]  We've chosen President who's gone on television with this Mickey Mouse show and have had no
[1:50:30.680 --> 1:50:35.200]  experience whatsoever, all the way back to Obama, Bush, Julian Trump.
[1:50:35.200 --> 1:50:39.760]  While we do see the military brass more and more not following the orders of the President,
[1:50:39.760 --> 1:50:40.760]  that is unprecedented.
[1:50:40.760 --> 1:50:45.720]  I want to end up on that with you on the other side, see if you agree with that, or where
[1:50:45.720 --> 1:50:46.720]  you see that going.
[1:50:46.720 --> 1:50:50.520]  But, I mean, we've had Dempsey telling the Chairman of the Joint, telling the Chairman
[1:50:50.520 --> 1:50:55.040]  of the Senate Armed Service Committee that he's full of it, telling Obama he's wrong.
[1:50:55.040 --> 1:50:56.040]  That is wild.
[1:50:56.040 --> 1:50:57.040]  We'll be right back.
[1:50:57.040 --> 1:51:19.280]  Hey, boomer, I learned in school today that 60% of our bodies are made of water.
[1:51:19.280 --> 1:51:22.960]  Good thing we have the Berkey system, it's the cleanest, best water ever.
[1:51:22.960 --> 1:51:27.080]  Mom says it's because the Berkey filtration system cleans out the bad stuff and leaks only
[1:51:27.080 --> 1:51:28.720]  pure, delicious water.
[1:51:28.720 --> 1:51:29.720]  I know, right?
[1:51:29.720 --> 1:51:30.720]  You love it, too.
[1:51:30.720 --> 1:51:32.240]  Yeah, I'm thirsty, too.
[1:51:32.240 --> 1:51:33.600]  Let's go get some.
[1:51:33.600 --> 1:51:44.040]  Get Berkey clean water by calling 877-886-3653, that's 877-886-3653, or visit goberkey.com.

[1:52:02.440 --> 1:52:07.520]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors
[1:52:07.520 --> 1:52:10.800]  and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[1:52:10.800 --> 1:52:16.040]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.

[1:52:44.920 --> 1:52:45.920]  dose.
[1:52:45.920 --> 1:52:48.080]  I jump out of bed ready to fight these criminals every day.

[1:53:02.160 --> 1:53:06.480]  The doors lock, bills are paid, you've got a job that keeps the lights on and a home
[1:53:06.480 --> 1:53:12.880]  to call your own, but what happens when Mother Nature throws a curveball?
[1:53:12.880 --> 1:53:17.200]  Are you prepared to live without electricity or passable roads for weeks at a time?
[1:53:17.200 --> 1:53:19.280]  Do you even have a plan B?
[1:53:19.280 --> 1:53:22.480]  If you do, are you willing to bet your life on it?
[1:53:22.480 --> 1:53:23.880]  Children left with no homes.
[1:53:23.880 --> 1:53:25.640]  And no one's coming to help them.
[1:53:25.640 --> 1:53:31.160]  The first step towards self-reliance in the face of disaster is a visit to mypatriotsupply.com.

[1:53:51.360 --> 1:53:54.000]  Or visit us at mypatriotsupply.com.
[1:53:54.000 --> 1:54:14.000]  Remember before it's time to survive, it's time to prepare.
[1:54:14.000 --> 1:54:15.000]  Here's what I'm trying to get across to listeners.
[1:54:15.000 --> 1:54:20.680]  I grew up in a house where we read history books, we were into what had happened in the
[1:54:20.680 --> 1:54:21.680]  world.
[1:54:21.680 --> 1:54:26.760]  We learned that history was incredibly exciting, studying government was incredibly exciting,
[1:54:26.760 --> 1:54:31.560]  studying military history was incredibly exciting, and I'm not even that smart of a person.
[1:54:31.560 --> 1:54:35.080]  Then I realized the general public does not even know the three branches of government
[1:54:35.080 --> 1:54:40.400]  on average, people are getting more and more disconnected, but they don't trust the system
[1:54:40.400 --> 1:54:41.920]  at the same time.
[1:54:41.920 --> 1:54:45.880]  But they're still like fish out of water, they're so ignorant.
[1:54:45.880 --> 1:54:52.160]  So you've got a political class that's been feeding on that and getting away with bloody
[1:54:52.160 --> 1:54:58.200]  murder but also smoking their own dope and becoming incompetent themselves.
[1:54:58.200 --> 1:55:05.240]  You can't have that in an age of nuclear weapons and drones and flesh-eating bacteria and Ebola.
[1:55:05.240 --> 1:55:13.560]  And I just hope that this political elite hits the panic button and pulls up.
[1:55:13.560 --> 1:55:19.120]  You know, Dr. Pachett could say, well, there's nothing really moral in geopolitics.
[1:55:19.120 --> 1:55:22.800]  Well, I get the Machiavellian view.
[1:55:22.800 --> 1:55:27.440]  But at a certain point, if you don't have moral authority, you don't have anything.
[1:55:27.440 --> 1:55:32.280]  I don't even buy into the Machiavellian view and I'm not accusing you, Doc, of being Machiavellian.
[1:55:32.280 --> 1:55:35.120]  I think the true moral high ground is the way to go.
[1:55:35.120 --> 1:55:40.240]  It creates prosperity, it creates security, history shows that.
[1:55:40.240 --> 1:55:43.120]  I see the military as the most awaited group.
[1:55:43.120 --> 1:55:48.200]  I don't lionize the military when it's involved as an instrument of evil in many cases.
[1:55:48.200 --> 1:55:53.160]  I just have studied things and found it is one of the only large reservoirs of people
[1:55:53.160 --> 1:55:55.960]  that are dedicated and listen to me.
[1:55:55.960 --> 1:56:00.080]  So I don't get the paradox of the military doing all these evil deeds for the globalist,
[1:56:00.080 --> 1:56:05.280]  sometimes doing good, but then loving me, showing that they do support the Second Amendment
[1:56:05.280 --> 1:56:06.680]  and so many things.
[1:56:06.680 --> 1:56:12.120]  And it's clear there's a power struggle going on and I see the military more and more not
[1:56:12.120 --> 1:56:17.680]  being belligerent, but disagreeing with the worst political pimps like Senator Graham
[1:56:17.680 --> 1:56:21.360]  and Obama, briefly putting bookends on it.
[1:56:21.360 --> 1:56:27.280]  Where is the military right now stacked up against the rest of the power structure?
[1:56:27.280 --> 1:56:28.720]  Military has stood its ground.
[1:56:28.720 --> 1:56:34.200]  Dennis Clapper, the DNI Director of National Intelligence has refused to resign and I'm glad
[1:56:34.200 --> 1:56:39.240]  that because even after Obama accused him and the rest of the intelligence community
[1:56:39.240 --> 1:56:45.680]  of being a failure, which of course was absurd, in fact, we're briefing Obama, the military
[1:56:45.680 --> 1:56:49.120]  will stand up to their duty, that's our military.
[1:56:49.120 --> 1:56:53.840]  They believe in country, they believe in honor, they don't do that for money, they're not
[1:56:53.840 --> 1:56:58.840]  mercenary, this is not black water, but you always have to remember, Alex, and your audience
[1:56:58.840 --> 1:57:05.160]  has to understand, democracy is always, there's a tension between the repression inherent
[1:57:05.160 --> 1:57:06.160]  in the republic.
[1:57:06.160 --> 1:57:12.040]  We're a republic, not a democracy, and those of us who protest against it and serve it,
[1:57:12.040 --> 1:57:17.240]  so that we have a constant tension and paradox between two elements of our republic.
[1:57:17.240 --> 1:57:20.080]  That's been true since the founding of our fathers.
[1:57:20.080 --> 1:57:25.200]  They had to have money, they had to fight against Congress, they had to fight against
[1:57:25.200 --> 1:57:30.800]  the homeland, but only 4% of our population fought in the Revolutionary War out of 700,000
[1:57:30.800 --> 1:57:31.800]  people.
[1:57:31.800 --> 1:57:39.680]  That's a minor group, and we have never literally been subservient to any political group.
[1:57:39.680 --> 1:57:43.800]  If you think a political group can dominate the United States, be it the president or
[1:57:43.800 --> 1:57:45.880]  anybody else, I think that's over.
[1:57:45.880 --> 1:57:50.520]  No, I know, I know, I mean the Iraqis fighting back the military couldn't even handle them.
[1:57:50.520 --> 1:57:53.880]  If the American people ever realized the power they have, this could all end very quickly.
[1:57:53.880 --> 1:57:55.840]  I think that's where the answer lies.
[1:57:55.840 --> 1:58:00.880]  How do we get the spirit of the American people to wake up again and start acting like free
[1:58:00.880 --> 1:58:01.880]  people?
[1:58:01.880 --> 1:58:08.120]  I think the spirit comes in from people like you and others who caution them and encourage
[1:58:08.120 --> 1:58:11.080]  them to get involved in local politics.
[1:58:11.080 --> 1:58:18.440]  Nothing is more effective in grassroots politics, be it in Dallas or be it in El Paso.
[1:58:18.440 --> 1:58:23.000]  When you vote for city commission or a county commission, you're beginning to affect the
[1:58:23.000 --> 1:58:24.000]  country.
[1:58:24.000 --> 1:58:27.840]  Oh yeah, we have a super patriot Liberty Lover who's the front-runner for city council right
[1:58:27.840 --> 1:58:28.840]  now, Dr. Laura Presley.
[1:58:28.840 --> 1:58:33.280]  I'm seeing it all over the country, Dr. Pachennick, thanks for the hour, StevePachennick.com,
[1:58:33.280 --> 1:58:34.280]  very interesting perspective.
[1:58:34.280 --> 1:58:35.280]  Thank you so much.
[1:58:35.280 --> 1:58:42.280]  And we've got Max Kaiser on the economy coming up.
[1:58:42.280 --> 1:58:49.920]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[1:58:49.920 --> 1:58:50.920]  Another major health threat.
[1:58:50.920 --> 1:58:55.320]  This one in Toledo, Ohio where everybody in the entire city has been told not to drink
[1:58:55.320 --> 1:58:56.320]  the water.
[1:58:56.320 --> 1:58:58.640]  Ohio's governor declaring a state of emergency.
[1:58:58.640 --> 1:59:04.360]  Did you know that the average person uses about 80 to 100 gallons of water at home every
[1:59:04.360 --> 1:59:05.640]  single day?
[1:59:05.640 --> 1:59:08.640]  If there's a water emergency, will you be prepared?
[1:59:08.640 --> 1:59:11.640]  Tanicked residents forming long lines throughout the day.
[1:59:11.640 --> 1:59:13.640]  We're here at a supermarket in Toledo.
[1:59:13.640 --> 1:59:16.560]  You can see the shelves empty where water once was.
[1:59:16.560 --> 1:59:22.480]  To stay safe and healthy during a crisis, you must have access to safe, clean water.
[1:59:22.480 --> 1:59:25.640]  Water which will not be available at your local grocery store.
[1:59:25.640 --> 1:59:28.880]  There's a mad dash on right now to stock up on supplies.

[1:59:52.240 --> 2:00:05.600]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:00:05.600 --> 2:00:10.400]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[2:00:10.400 --> 2:00:11.400]  You want answers?
[2:00:11.400 --> 2:00:13.400]  Well, so does he.
[2:00:13.400 --> 2:00:17.720]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[2:00:17.720 --> 2:00:39.600]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[2:00:39.600 --> 2:00:44.080]  We got Max Kaiser joining us, coming up to give us his take on what's happening in the
[2:00:44.080 --> 2:00:47.680]  bond market, what's happening with gold.
[2:00:47.680 --> 2:00:49.400]  Who's the world economy melts down?
[2:00:49.400 --> 2:00:53.960]  Gold will go up, even as other commodities go down, because it's an ultimate store of
[2:00:53.960 --> 2:00:58.240]  wealth and a hedge against imploding economies, and it is up.
[2:00:58.240 --> 2:01:03.160]  When I heard that bond markets had imploded and the stock market was down so much today,
[2:01:03.160 --> 2:01:05.160]  I thought, man, I bet gold goes down.
[2:01:05.160 --> 2:01:09.800]  I said this aloud, but I said, or maybe it'll go up, because when I saw that oil was way
[2:01:09.800 --> 2:01:14.600]  down, I thought, I wonder, but man, when I saw gold going up, that's pretty serious
[2:01:14.600 --> 2:01:17.160]  right there.
[2:01:17.160 --> 2:01:21.840]  The London Guardian reports accounting for drugs and prostitution to help push U.K. economy
[2:01:21.840 --> 2:01:30.320]  up by 65 billion pounds, 65 billion pounds, that's over 100 billion U.S. dollars.
[2:01:30.320 --> 2:01:35.760]  A more inclusive approach to GDP comes into force in September to comply with EU rules
[2:01:35.760 --> 2:01:40.840]  on measuring the economy, but they've legalized the prostitution basically EU-wide.
[2:01:40.840 --> 2:01:44.640]  And of course, they make women that are out of work more than a year in Germany.
[2:01:44.640 --> 2:01:48.320]  They call them in and assess them and say, you're a good looking, hit the bricks, we're
[2:01:48.320 --> 2:01:53.600]  got a woman going to teach you how to hook, here's your female pimp, you think I'm joking?
[2:01:53.600 --> 2:01:55.440]  That's like Der Spiegel two years ago.
[2:01:55.440 --> 2:01:58.920]  I remember seeing that headline on Drudge like two years ago and going, no, they're not
[2:01:58.920 --> 2:02:02.440]  making people, making women hit the bricks.
[2:02:02.440 --> 2:02:08.000]  And yeah, folks, they make the women's street walk in Germany.
[2:02:08.000 --> 2:02:11.200]  And even tell them what a full day's work is so they can pay those taxes.
[2:02:11.200 --> 2:02:14.720]  Man, you got to love socialism, don't you?
[2:02:14.720 --> 2:02:17.600]  Oh my God, that is incredible.
[2:02:17.600 --> 2:02:20.760]  The Roman Empire and its decline made women hook.
[2:02:20.760 --> 2:02:24.040]  Oh, just amazing.
[2:02:24.040 --> 2:02:25.360]  That's feminism for it.
[2:02:25.360 --> 2:02:26.960]  Really empowers women, doesn't it?
[2:02:26.960 --> 2:02:31.680]  I don't mean, I didn't mean to get off on a jag.
[2:02:31.680 --> 2:02:33.840]  It's just that stuff is getting so weird.
[2:02:33.840 --> 2:02:34.840]  Look at this.
[2:02:34.840 --> 2:02:39.700]  U.S. troops assisting in Ebola mission may be quarantined in an unprecedented move to
[2:02:39.700 --> 2:02:43.760]  protect U.S. troops that might be exposed to Ebola, U.S. military commanders are being
[2:02:43.760 --> 2:02:48.920]  given the authority to quarantine troops for 21 days at a Department of Defense facility
[2:02:48.920 --> 2:02:51.160]  where they will be monitored for signs of the disease.
[2:02:51.160 --> 2:02:54.120]  Well that's where people with Ebola are supposed to go, but say they won't do that, they'll
[2:02:54.120 --> 2:02:57.400]  send them to a regular hospital.
[2:02:57.400 --> 2:02:59.400]  You know, I don't agree with Pachinic on everything.
[2:02:59.400 --> 2:03:04.360]  I don't think he's a bad guy overall, but he's so inside the system that probably listening
[2:03:04.360 --> 2:03:11.400]  right now that, you know, has, he has a tinge of Machiavellian mindset where you make the
[2:03:11.400 --> 2:03:13.720]  decision, well we're the good guys, we can do whatever we want.
[2:03:13.720 --> 2:03:19.280]  Well that won't put words in his mouth, but you know, putting the troops in, at a certain
[2:03:19.280 --> 2:03:21.680]  point you've got to just let Africa do what Africa wants.
[2:03:21.680 --> 2:03:24.760]  If those countries want to fight each other, let them kill each other.
[2:03:24.760 --> 2:03:27.680]  If they're going to spread Ebola, let them spread Ebola.
[2:03:27.680 --> 2:03:32.800]  How about we shut off the flights and just let Africa, like Ron Paul says, do what it
[2:03:32.800 --> 2:03:33.800]  wants?
[2:03:33.800 --> 2:03:41.360]  I got to sneak in suspicion if colonial powers hadn't been meddling in Africa for 550 something
[2:03:41.360 --> 2:03:44.440]  years that Africa would be a lot better.
[2:03:44.440 --> 2:03:48.880]  Look at what Libya did, building up areas of Africa, and then the West went in and blew
[2:03:48.880 --> 2:03:54.320]  it up, put Al Qaeda in charge, and Pachinic was against that, and Pachinic's against funding
[2:03:54.320 --> 2:03:55.320]  ISIS.
[2:03:55.320 --> 2:04:00.080]  So they'll sit there and say, oh the CIA funded ISIS and funded all these groups, and you
[2:04:00.080 --> 2:04:04.920]  know, it's, and I'm not covering what Pachinic said now that he's gone, I just let him talk,
[2:04:04.920 --> 2:04:08.040]  so whatever got to these points, maybe next time he's on we can discuss it.
[2:04:08.040 --> 2:04:13.960]  It's just a schizophrenic thing where the system has the CIA creating Al Qaeda and ISIS, and
[2:04:13.960 --> 2:04:18.960]  the army goes and fights them.
[2:04:18.960 --> 2:04:23.000]  And yeah, the army legitimately goes and fights them, but so you can say, well they're the
[2:04:23.000 --> 2:04:30.360]  good guys, but then you've got the CIA creating them when the whole thing's working in tandem.
[2:04:30.360 --> 2:04:41.000]  And then we have a CIA that went, probably hired private hitmen to double cap Gary Webb,
[2:04:41.000 --> 2:04:43.760]  because he exposed the government was shipping the drugs in.
[2:04:43.760 --> 2:04:47.760]  I mean, come on, you got a drug war and you're shipping the stuff in?
[2:04:47.760 --> 2:04:48.760]  No!
[2:04:48.760 --> 2:04:49.760]  That is super immoral.
[2:04:49.760 --> 2:04:53.520]  You know how many people I know whose lives have been ruined by the drugs the government
[2:04:53.520 --> 2:04:59.760]  shipped in, and then they're ruining our bill of rights with the drug war?
[2:04:59.760 --> 2:05:03.440]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[2:05:03.440 --> 2:05:07.800]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[2:05:07.800 --> 2:05:09.800]  Can you put two and two together?
[2:05:09.800 --> 2:05:15.400]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and 308 sniper rounds, is reasonably
[2:05:15.400 --> 2:05:17.440]  priced and fully legal.

[2:05:28.440 --> 2:05:32.880]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[2:05:32.880 --> 2:05:38.000]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors
[2:05:38.000 --> 2:05:41.280]  and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[2:05:41.280 --> 2:05:46.560]  Just one of the key compounds, BiopQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.

[2:06:29.160 --> 2:06:33.520]  These people are assaulting us, targeting of patriots engaged.

[2:07:27.240 --> 2:07:32.720]  Not our iodine, it comes from over 200 million year old crystal salt deposits and is tested
[2:07:32.720 --> 2:07:34.680]  and proven to be completely pure.

[2:08:20.960 --> 2:08:25.760]  That was Dr. Henry Kissinger bringing us in, talking about the non-existent New World
[2:08:25.760 --> 2:08:30.120]  Order.
[2:08:30.120 --> 2:08:34.080]  I wanted to get Max Kaiser on, he's on for an hour next week and I want him to still
[2:08:34.080 --> 2:08:36.760]  join us if he can, but he's on with this till the bottom of the hour now and then we're
[2:08:36.760 --> 2:08:42.160]  going to talk to an expert on gold about why it's going up, but I don't have the crew
[2:08:42.160 --> 2:08:45.760]  or the staff to do it, I have a wonderful crew that runs the show live, you the listeners
[2:08:45.760 --> 2:08:52.720]  heard it and saw it, this last year Max predicted his big prediction that by the middle of 2014
[2:08:52.720 --> 2:09:01.320]  you'd see an implosion of the US Treasury market, well here's the headline, he misses
[2:09:01.320 --> 2:09:06.200]  prediction but better late than never, he said by the middle, this is the latter part,
[2:09:06.200 --> 2:09:11.600]  but not by much, I guess you could say 9 months in is the middle, but it's kind of the end
[2:09:11.600 --> 2:09:18.440]  of the middle, bull run for the exit, Financial Times of London, rising concerns about the
[2:09:18.440 --> 2:09:25.760]  global economy triggered a flash crash in US Treasury yields on Wednesday, yesterday,
[2:09:25.760 --> 2:09:30.320]  as losses spread across stock markets and the new wave of investors appeared to give up
[2:09:30.320 --> 2:09:32.800]  on their bullish bets.
[2:09:32.800 --> 2:09:35.800]  The yield of the tenured treasury, the key barometer of the strength of the US economy
[2:09:35.800 --> 2:09:40.000]  fell below two percent for the first time after the Federal Reserve began talking about
[2:09:40.000 --> 2:09:49.400]  removing QE, unlimited, they call it QE stimulus here, and with more of that data is Max Kaiser
[2:09:49.400 --> 2:09:54.400]  former very successful stock traders worked of course with George Soros's son and Soros
[2:09:54.400 --> 2:09:58.480]  and you know I've been on the inside of that hell, this guy was like on Nightline back
[2:09:58.480 --> 2:10:03.080]  in the 80's and he retired, he still does some stock market stuff, he's a journalist
[2:10:03.080 --> 2:10:11.720]  with RT and also BBC and Al Jazeera and a frequent contributor to infowars.com, MaxKaiser.com
[2:10:11.720 --> 2:10:15.960]  is his website, I want to get his take on the economy, then Ebola because there's no
[2:10:15.960 --> 2:10:21.480]  way the CDC said they let an Ebola patient nurse treating Ebola people who was sick
[2:10:21.480 --> 2:10:26.440]  fly, she asked for permission they gave it, they got guys not wearing hazmat suits, loading
[2:10:26.440 --> 2:10:32.640]  the Ebola patient on a plane, I'm entering the twilight zone, we've got more flights
[2:10:32.640 --> 2:10:39.360]  coming in as even South America, in Central America and the Caribbean band flights, America's
[2:10:39.360 --> 2:10:44.200]  like a giant trash can or vomit bag for Ebola, I don't say that to be gross, I mean that's
[2:10:44.200 --> 2:10:49.800]  what we are, one Ebola patient said they had rooms piled to the ceiling of the blood and
[2:10:49.800 --> 2:10:56.360]  feces, I mean you just bleed out and basically just pop, you just become pure virus, it just
[2:10:56.360 --> 2:10:59.960]  builds and builds and builds until the virus is just basically half your body weight and
[2:10:59.960 --> 2:11:03.360]  just spews out everywhere.
[2:11:03.360 --> 2:11:09.720]  And we have another report on infowars.com, CDC pushes preparedness for zombies over Ebola,
[2:11:09.720 --> 2:11:15.880]  if you're prepared for a zombie you'll be prepared for any infectious disease, CDC director
[2:11:15.880 --> 2:11:20.440]  said, and we have an article showing that they obsess over zombies, imaginary stuff
[2:11:20.440 --> 2:11:24.840]  more than Ebola, but really that's just their cover for Ebola, so we'll get MaxKaiser's
[2:11:24.840 --> 2:11:26.800]  brief take on that and then more next week.
[2:11:26.800 --> 2:11:32.200]  Well Max, I know it's on your website, you did videos, newscast, over a year ago predicting
[2:11:32.200 --> 2:11:38.200]  by the middle of 2014, it didn't happen in the middle, it happened in the latter part,
[2:11:38.200 --> 2:11:43.880]  but you were correct, what's going on and is this the big indicator of the big one,
[2:11:43.880 --> 2:11:48.440]  we've seen the Dow Jones lose all of its gains the last six months, Dr. Pachennick who's
[2:11:48.440 --> 2:11:52.320]  a big insider thinks it'll all bounce back, what do you say?
[2:11:52.320 --> 2:11:58.400]  Hey Alex, how's it going, great to be with you again, I think if you look at the global
[2:11:58.400 --> 2:12:06.000]  picture what I'm seeing are a couple of interesting places like, and it was mentioned earlier,
[2:12:06.000 --> 2:12:13.040]  in France, so in terms of the bond markets collapsing, they did collapse this past week
[2:12:13.040 --> 2:12:21.880]  in Greece, Italy and France, so France is now the new basket case of Europe up until
[2:12:21.880 --> 2:12:22.880]  this week.
[2:12:22.880 --> 2:12:26.000]  And you said France would go down next, I remember that last year, that's why you left
[2:12:26.000 --> 2:12:27.000]  France.
[2:12:27.000 --> 2:12:34.280]  Well, I did leave France, I came here so I can report more closely on what I call the,
[2:12:34.280 --> 2:12:39.520]  you know, this is the heart of the global financial scandals are in London, so I thought
[2:12:39.520 --> 2:12:47.720]  I would come here to report it, but France is now on an extremely bad, an extremely
[2:12:47.720 --> 2:12:48.720]  bad place.
[2:12:48.720 --> 2:12:56.440]  They, their bonds are now trading like Greece and Italy, and so the whole Eurozone is continuing
[2:12:56.440 --> 2:13:03.880]  to collapse and there's a lot of pressure on the European Central Bank to engage in
[2:13:03.880 --> 2:13:10.400]  what they do in the United States, this quantitative easing, this buyback of huge amounts of paper,
[2:13:10.400 --> 2:13:15.080]  but it's not set up that way in Europe, they don't have European wide bonds per se, so
[2:13:15.080 --> 2:13:17.160]  it's not really set up for that.
[2:13:17.160 --> 2:13:21.960]  And Germany is very reluctant to do anything like that because it would be a precursor
[2:13:21.960 --> 2:13:26.760]  to an outbreak of inflation, which they're very sensitive about, but I think the big
[2:13:26.760 --> 2:13:34.480]  story this week is that all of the moves from the IMF and the global banking system back
[2:13:34.480 --> 2:13:41.360]  in 2008 to save Europe, they now appear to have run their course and failed in Europe,
[2:13:41.360 --> 2:13:47.600]  which is a $17 trillion economy is really on debt store step, and in particular, we're
[2:13:47.600 --> 2:13:53.320]  seeing France now become part of the basket case of countries, and France is a very big
[2:13:53.320 --> 2:13:57.840]  country economically speaking, so now they're being flushed down the toilet.
[2:13:57.840 --> 2:14:03.640]  We see continued problems in Japan that we've talked about, their economy has been in the,
[2:14:03.640 --> 2:14:10.160]  they're entering their third decade of deflation, so that's looking bad.
[2:14:10.160 --> 2:14:16.160]  The U.S. at the moment, and this is the game that they play, they talked about possibly
[2:14:16.160 --> 2:14:20.520]  easing up on quantitative easing, but as I've said many, many, many times, you cannot taper
[2:14:20.520 --> 2:14:26.520]  a Ponzi scheme, and very quickly the market's dropped 8% or 9%, 10% from the high on the
[2:14:26.520 --> 2:14:30.240]  Nasdaq, and now today they've come out and they're saying, well, we might have to bring
[2:14:30.240 --> 2:14:35.760]  in quantitative easing for QE4, and that they're going to buy back a lot of bonds all over
[2:14:35.760 --> 2:14:43.120]  again and try to keep this Ponzi scheme going, but there is, unfortunately, it cannot go
[2:14:43.120 --> 2:14:47.840]  on forever, and we're seeing these markets kind of roll over at this point.
[2:14:47.840 --> 2:14:52.680]  So let me ask you the question, you did accurately predict that by the middle, I mean, even though
[2:14:52.680 --> 2:14:55.480]  it's three months or two months after you thought it would have happened by, that's
[2:14:55.480 --> 2:14:59.800]  still pretty much an accurate prediction, a stunningly accurate prediction, because
[2:14:59.800 --> 2:15:03.200]  a lot of other folks weren't saying that, and people say this would go on forever.
[2:15:03.200 --> 2:15:07.840]  Now they are introducing the idea that it could totally collapse like France and others
[2:15:07.840 --> 2:15:14.680]  have, and Spain and Greece and others, clearly it's moving in that direction.
[2:15:14.680 --> 2:15:18.920]  Now a lot of other financial experts are saying what you're saying, A, what's the next big
[2:15:18.920 --> 2:15:23.600]  prediction, and how bad will it get, and will it be inflationary or depressionary?
[2:15:23.600 --> 2:15:29.120]  Well, look at the, look at me here in the, in the UK, they, it's interesting how the
[2:15:29.120 --> 2:15:35.200]  government just states these blatant lies, so the government here in the UK says that
[2:15:35.200 --> 2:15:40.800]  the number of jobs are up, and the economy is recovering, but their tax revenues are
[2:15:40.800 --> 2:15:47.120]  down sharply, because these jobs are people declaring themselves self-employed, so the
[2:15:47.120 --> 2:15:51.600]  government counts it as a job, even though they're not really making any income, or
[2:15:51.600 --> 2:15:58.200]  across the board, wages are down, so the tax revenues are in fact decreasing, which means
[2:15:58.200 --> 2:16:02.040]  the debt in the UK is increasing, and the economy is shrinking, but the government will
[2:16:02.040 --> 2:16:07.120]  say, you know, the economy is expanding, so the, the economy here in the UK is also shrinking
[2:16:07.120 --> 2:16:16.480]  along with the rest of Europe, so will they be able to somehow reinflate this economy
[2:16:16.480 --> 2:16:17.480]  to achieve growth?
[2:16:17.480 --> 2:16:21.040]  And the answer is no, they haven't achieved any growth at all, they're, the debts are
[2:16:21.040 --> 2:16:29.920]  continuing to grow, and, and so this is just, unfortunately, it means more of what we're
[2:16:29.920 --> 2:16:36.400]  seeing now, the, the, the, the blocking out of huge parts of the economy from the majority
[2:16:36.400 --> 2:16:42.920]  of people who are being raked over the coals, because they, they have no access to credit,
[2:16:42.920 --> 2:16:48.480]  they have no access to decent wages, and all this money that's being printed is just
[2:16:48.480 --> 2:16:53.760]  going in, directly into the pocket of a few folks at the very, the very top of the pyramid.
[2:16:53.760 --> 2:16:59.040]  So it's a totally rigged gulag archipelago casino gulag as you've coined, so again,
[2:16:59.040 --> 2:17:01.040]  what happens next?
[2:17:01.040 --> 2:17:08.960]  Well, I think, I think the world, the money in the world, the big money in the world,
[2:17:08.960 --> 2:17:14.520]  the people who have hundreds of billions of dollars, they, they don't want to lose their
[2:17:14.520 --> 2:17:19.200]  money, and they're going to look for a place to rotate into, you know, the US, the US Treasury
[2:17:19.200 --> 2:17:27.160]  market has, in fact, been a safe haven for these huge money types for quite some time,
[2:17:27.160 --> 2:17:31.400]  and they have ignored gold, and they've ignored silver to some, to some extent.
[2:17:31.400 --> 2:17:38.000]  I think that you're going to see finally this rotation out of paper completely, or just
[2:17:38.000 --> 2:17:43.120]  all the sovereign bond markets are, are just completely ignored, and there will be that
[2:17:43.120 --> 2:17:48.840]  rotation back into assets, back in, back into hard assets like gold's over.
[2:17:48.840 --> 2:17:50.840]  And so I think that's, that, that, that's,
[2:17:50.840 --> 2:17:55.720]  Well, sure, we've seen the University of Texas, the Chinese government, the US government,
[2:17:55.720 --> 2:18:00.200]  all these rich billionaires hoarding gold while badmouthing it out the other side of
[2:18:00.200 --> 2:18:05.840]  their mouth, because it exposes their paper fiat tower of fraud.
[2:18:05.840 --> 2:18:08.000]  And so where do you expect gold to start going?
[2:18:08.000 --> 2:18:12.000]  It's surged already today, that we'll put up the latest gold trading right now for folks,
[2:18:12.000 --> 2:18:15.280]  I'm going to put that on screen for TV viewers, I'll read it out to radio listeners.
[2:18:15.280 --> 2:18:18.920]  But what do you expect to happen, and what else do you expect to go up?
[2:18:18.920 --> 2:18:21.560]  And then how bad will this bond route get?
[2:18:21.560 --> 2:18:23.960]  What do you expect to see in major stock markets?
[2:18:23.960 --> 2:18:30.520]  Well, the price of the bond, you know, trading at a high that we haven't seen in over 300
[2:18:30.520 --> 2:18:37.720]  years, in, in the UK, in, in and over the entire life of America, 240 years plus.
[2:18:37.720 --> 2:18:43.960]  But I think to give some context to your previous guess, in terms of the price of oil, you know,
[2:18:43.960 --> 2:18:46.680]  there's tremendous pressure on Russia.
[2:18:46.680 --> 2:18:53.760]  And after the Ukraine situation, and I have a different take on the Ukraine situation,
[2:18:53.760 --> 2:18:59.640]  after listening to Victoria Nuland orchestrate a coup of that government in Kiev not too
[2:18:59.640 --> 2:19:06.800]  long ago, nevertheless, my understanding is that Saudi Arabia, our good friends in Saudi
[2:19:06.800 --> 2:19:11.920]  Arabia, the ones who behead more people than ISIS will ever behead, the ones who gave us
[2:19:11.920 --> 2:19:17.680]  9-11, the ones who were threatening Tony Blair in his office that he'd kill him if he didn't
[2:19:17.680 --> 2:19:19.560]  call off a serious fraud investigation.
[2:19:19.560 --> 2:19:24.080]  Our friends in Saudi Arabia have been dumping paper gold in the markets, driving the price
[2:19:24.080 --> 2:19:25.080]  of oil down.
[2:19:25.080 --> 2:19:27.160]  I'm sorry, oil, not gold.
[2:19:27.160 --> 2:19:32.200]  And now to the point where in the United States, that shale industry, that brand new shale
[2:19:32.200 --> 2:19:37.720]  industry, you know, unless the oil is at $100 a barrel, the shale industry doesn't make
[2:19:37.720 --> 2:19:38.720]  any money.
[2:19:38.720 --> 2:19:42.520]  So Saudi Arabia has got a deal to drive down oil to hurt Russia, they also want to bankrupt
[2:19:42.520 --> 2:19:46.320]  the shale industry, that's why they've been financing all the anti-fracking movements.
[2:19:46.320 --> 2:19:51.600]  Now I'm not saying fracking is perfect, folks, but Saudi Arabia is financing the whole thing
[2:19:51.600 --> 2:19:53.600]  with the leftist to shut it down.
[2:19:53.600 --> 2:19:56.280]  I want to see what Max Keiser says about that when we come back.
[2:19:56.280 --> 2:19:59.680]  Max Keiser is our guest, I'm Alex Jones.

[2:24:21.760 --> 2:24:27.480]  Actually had Kevin Booth get in there connected to the legal team and get that and they locked
[2:24:27.480 --> 2:24:32.080]  him up in a quasi solitary confinement for a while and that happened.
[2:24:32.080 --> 2:24:35.480]  What hit me when I was watching kill the messenger that's over the top good, it should
[2:24:35.480 --> 2:24:45.960]  win multiple academy awards, is that I was such so close to Gary North and then it took
[2:24:45.960 --> 2:24:50.560]  all the other crazy stuff in my life, not Gary North, Gary Webb, Gary North's another
[2:24:50.560 --> 2:24:56.960]  writer with Oliver North and Gary North and then I didn't break these big CIA drug dealing
[2:24:56.960 --> 2:25:00.680]  stories with him because I was just like, yeah I already know all that, sure come on
[2:25:00.680 --> 2:25:04.040]  the air, sure sell your book, yeah you're a hero, yeah they're trying to destroy you,
[2:25:04.040 --> 2:25:05.040]  but why?
[2:25:05.040 --> 2:25:06.520]  Why put out new documents?
[2:25:06.520 --> 2:25:13.320]  Why put out a website with you Gary Webb and then they killed him and they attacked
[2:25:13.320 --> 2:25:14.840]  me for saying they killed him.
[2:25:14.840 --> 2:25:18.440]  But the movie basically says they killed him, they show they were threatening his wife
[2:25:18.440 --> 2:25:24.280]  and his kids and that they kill him, I'm just, I'm just speechless.
[2:25:24.280 --> 2:25:28.320]  How powerful kill the messenger and the story about Gary Webb has pulled a surprise and
[2:25:28.320 --> 2:25:32.360]  all the rest of it is, I mean it's simply amazing how all his so-called friends turned
[2:25:32.360 --> 2:25:36.480]  against him when the mainstream media said he was a fraud with no proof.
[2:25:36.480 --> 2:25:38.440]  Have you seen kill the messenger yet Kaiser?
[2:25:38.440 --> 2:25:41.680]  No, no sounds good though.
[2:25:41.680 --> 2:25:46.880]  I just feel like I dropped the ball monumentally, not working with him more and helping get
[2:25:46.880 --> 2:25:48.680]  his material out man.
[2:25:48.680 --> 2:25:53.440]  Max, why do you think we're soul life?
[2:25:53.440 --> 2:25:59.080]  We're too pretty, you know people, they don't want to kill off such a beautiful, beautiful
[2:25:59.080 --> 2:26:03.880]  species, examples of the human species, they would just destroy their souls more than what
[2:26:03.880 --> 2:26:05.800]  they do on a day-to-day basis.
[2:26:05.800 --> 2:26:10.880]  Come on, Gary Webb had a beautiful soul.
[2:26:10.880 --> 2:26:12.360]  Why would they kill somebody like him?
[2:26:12.360 --> 2:26:17.440]  Well, I know he had a new book coming out proving everything he said was true and more
[2:26:17.440 --> 2:26:22.200]  and that's why they kill him and of course the book never came out.
[2:26:22.200 --> 2:26:26.720]  I don't mean to digress, it's just that it's just amazing that this film came out and told
[2:26:26.720 --> 2:26:27.720]  the truth.
[2:26:27.720 --> 2:26:28.720]  I'm dumbfounded.
[2:26:28.720 --> 2:26:32.000]  You know, I'm seeing more and more positive messages from Hollywood.
[2:26:32.000 --> 2:26:33.880]  What do you think is happening there, Max Kaiser?
[2:26:33.880 --> 2:26:39.600]  It goes to cycles, you know, they, in back in the 60s and 70s you remember that the
[2:26:39.600 --> 2:26:45.560]  anti-hero, they had films like Dog Day Afternoon and these other films where they, and then
[2:26:45.560 --> 2:26:50.160]  Reagan was elected and they immediately came out with films like Top Gun and Star Wars
[2:26:50.160 --> 2:26:55.120]  where it's a very simple comic book type format and now we've had kind of like a, the last
[2:26:55.120 --> 2:26:59.520]  year or so, the comic book format has reached unbelievable proportions of absurdity where
[2:26:59.520 --> 2:27:03.920]  it's like an Iron Man, The Avengers, everything has comic books and now the pendulum is swinging
[2:27:03.920 --> 2:27:09.560]  back to, I think, the anti-hero type, I remember Billy Jack, those films from the
[2:27:09.560 --> 2:27:10.560]  70s.
[2:27:10.560 --> 2:27:11.560]  Oh, yeah.
[2:27:11.560 --> 2:27:12.560]  You know, that type of hero.
[2:27:12.560 --> 2:27:15.680]  So I think, you know, it runs in cycles and it runs, usually if you're, this is a guy
[2:27:15.680 --> 2:27:21.520]  named Robert Prector who is from, in Georgia, he came up with the Elliott Wave Theory.
[2:27:21.520 --> 2:27:27.240]  He does fantastic work tying market cycles to popular culture and it's very interesting
[2:27:27.240 --> 2:27:34.880]  what he does in that, in that realm and how you see during down markets, you see the rise
[2:27:34.880 --> 2:27:40.800]  of the anti-hero and during these bull markets, it's a very raw, raw, star-spangled superhero.
[2:27:40.800 --> 2:27:41.800]  Sure.
[2:27:41.800 --> 2:27:45.560]  Let me ask you this question in closing.
[2:27:45.560 --> 2:27:49.120]  How do you think this is all going to end with the markets?
[2:27:49.120 --> 2:27:50.920]  What's really happening in the world right now?
[2:27:50.920 --> 2:27:59.120]  You know, you always ask me this very broad, sweeping question, you know, what, where is
[2:27:59.120 --> 2:28:02.120]  it all going to end, type of, you know, whatever it is.
[2:28:02.120 --> 2:28:05.840]  Well, no, you made the big prediction the bond market was going to start imploding.
[2:28:05.840 --> 2:28:10.480]  It is all over the world, it is in U.S. Treasuries, which they say if that starts, it's the beginning
[2:28:10.480 --> 2:28:11.480]  of the end.
[2:28:11.480 --> 2:28:15.640]  So is this the time to start exiting the Titanic right now?
[2:28:15.640 --> 2:28:22.320]  The, where the rats are hiding, the last vestige of a safe haven status is in, is in
[2:28:22.320 --> 2:28:23.320]  the U.S. Treasury market.
[2:28:23.320 --> 2:28:27.800]  You know, you know, when that finally gets to the point where they can't jack it up
[2:28:27.800 --> 2:28:32.200]  any further, where the central banks, who, who they went from their balance sheet and
[2:28:32.200 --> 2:28:36.160]  the Federal Reserve Bank from, it has four to five trillion of these debts on their balance
[2:28:36.160 --> 2:28:41.360]  sheet, the Bank of England, it may have increased it by 600 percent, all the bad debts on their
[2:28:41.360 --> 2:28:42.360]  balance sheet.
[2:28:42.360 --> 2:28:46.880]  When it gets to the end, there's got to be a rotation into what's left, there's gold.
[2:28:46.880 --> 2:28:49.360]  There's got to be gold, there's got to be a rotation into gold.
[2:28:49.360 --> 2:28:52.520]  They've successfully avoided it for the last few years.
[2:28:52.520 --> 2:28:56.400]  But as you point out, there has been hoarding all over the, all over the world.
[2:28:56.400 --> 2:29:02.320]  People are still buying it, banks, countries like Russia and China are still buying gold.
[2:29:02.320 --> 2:29:07.800]  But as far as the way the paper monies are operated, they're still able to keep these
[2:29:07.800 --> 2:29:11.840]  prices at, at high levels that they bring in quantitative easing for, which just means
[2:29:11.840 --> 2:29:17.360]  that the government buys back its own paper, you know, ad nauseam, and they keep the pot,
[2:29:17.360 --> 2:29:19.880]  try to keep the Ponzi scheme going a little bit longer.
[2:29:19.880 --> 2:29:23.200]  What's going to happen then with the bond market and keep going down?
[2:29:23.200 --> 2:29:28.480]  Well, yields, yields are going down, okay, when you read a headline that says the yields
[2:29:28.480 --> 2:29:35.240]  are crashing, the fact is that the prices, the, it's an inverse relationship, the price
[2:29:35.240 --> 2:29:37.480]  of the bond is going higher.
[2:29:37.480 --> 2:29:41.400]  When they say the yields are crashing, the place where you find the price of the bond
[2:29:41.400 --> 2:29:48.120]  crashing and yields going higher is in Greece, Italy, and now France, that's where the bonds
[2:29:48.120 --> 2:29:49.120]  are collapsing.
[2:29:49.120 --> 2:29:53.920]  Great job Max Kaiser, Tatila, come, come back and put bookends on it, then we're going
[2:29:53.920 --> 2:29:59.640]  to get another guest on about gold, at about five minutes, stay with us.
[2:29:59.640 --> 2:30:05.040]  From the water table to our soils to the atmosphere itself, our world is becoming more and more
[2:30:05.040 --> 2:30:09.720]  toxic each and every day, but it's not just the air outside that's toxic, indoor air has
[2:30:09.720 --> 2:30:13.880]  been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor
[2:30:13.880 --> 2:30:18.960]  air, and most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their
[2:30:18.960 --> 2:30:19.960]  homes.
[2:30:19.960 --> 2:30:24.080]  There are more than 42 million smokers in the United States, well over a thousand types
[2:30:24.080 --> 2:30:29.120]  of mold in mildew linked to numerous conditions, and don't forget the fact that 6 million Americans
[2:30:29.120 --> 2:30:31.120]  live with pets they're allergic to as well.
[2:30:31.120 --> 2:30:35.580]  When I began to research these statistics, it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing
[2:30:35.580 --> 2:30:40.600]  my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape but that we can fight
[2:30:40.600 --> 2:30:45.880]  back against, made with organic and wild cultivated herbs and manufactured in the USA.

[2:30:59.600 --> 2:31:03.240]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[2:31:03.240 --> 2:31:07.600]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[2:31:07.600 --> 2:31:09.640]  Can you put two and two together?

[2:31:37.780 --> 2:31:41.080]  and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.

[2:32:27.360 --> 2:32:32.840]  Not our iodine, it comes from over 200 million year old crystal salt deposits and is tested
[2:32:32.840 --> 2:32:34.840]  and proven to be completely pure.

[2:33:07.600 --> 2:33:17.080]  We're live, ladies and gentlemen, and bringing us in is the great Peter Rees.
[2:33:17.080 --> 2:33:25.520]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center and the heart of the Resistance.
[2:33:25.520 --> 2:33:31.680]  The Rock Band is not iterative because there is a war on for your mind, because there's
[2:33:31.680 --> 2:33:34.680]  a war on for your mind.
[2:33:34.680 --> 2:33:45.160]  This song is balls to the walls, and that's an aviation term for slamming the throttle
[2:33:45.160 --> 2:33:52.640]  all the way up to the wall, or pedal to the metal, but has a double entendre of meaning
[2:33:52.640 --> 2:33:57.880]  taking wrecking balls to the East German wall.
[2:33:57.880 --> 2:34:04.320]  This was a protest song against the East German oppression that came out just a few years
[2:34:04.320 --> 2:34:08.360]  before the wall collapsed, and let's go ahead and crank it up.
[2:34:08.360 --> 2:34:22.600]  God bless them, they're going to break the chains, you can't stop them.
[2:34:22.600 --> 2:34:35.480]  Let's get the balls to the wall, they're going to finish up with Max Kaiser, they're
[2:34:35.480 --> 2:34:37.480]  going to look at gold with a gas.
[2:34:37.480 --> 2:34:43.000]  Now listen, I don't get stuff wrong on purpose, and I understand the basics of the bond market,
[2:34:43.000 --> 2:34:46.680]  I don't invest in it, so I'm always flipping things around, that's the kind of mistakes
[2:34:46.680 --> 2:34:47.680]  I make.
[2:34:47.680 --> 2:34:53.400]  Sometimes I'll come on here and say it's 2012, I mean it's 14, sometimes I'm writing checks
[2:34:53.400 --> 2:34:58.320]  and I'll write like 2011, I'm like no it's not, I just do weird stuff, that's why I'm
[2:34:58.320 --> 2:35:01.760]  always fact checking myself because I'll do some absurd things.
[2:35:01.760 --> 2:35:06.160]  When I come down here and I say the bond market's in trouble, the bond market's imploding, it
[2:35:06.160 --> 2:35:08.000]  is in Europe.
[2:35:08.000 --> 2:35:13.120]  That makes everybody then seesaw and run into the dollar over here, and then the US Treasuries,
[2:35:13.120 --> 2:35:18.920]  I see that as a bad sign because it makes the yield go down, but as a fake safe haven
[2:35:18.920 --> 2:35:24.080]  it pumps that bubble up more, and what Kaiser predicted was is the bond market would start
[2:35:24.080 --> 2:35:28.880]  melting down worldwide by the middle of this year.
[2:35:28.880 --> 2:35:33.720]  Not even specifically that our bond market would go belly up, he just said it would be
[2:35:33.720 --> 2:35:36.680]  in his words in trouble and you start seeing them implode.
[2:35:36.680 --> 2:35:42.280]  So finishing up Max Kaiser, talk to me like I'm five because I look at this and read the
[2:35:42.280 --> 2:35:46.680]  financial papers forever and I don't even know how to articulate it because it's such
[2:35:46.680 --> 2:35:52.560]  flim flam, naked shorting of gold, paper manipulation, what you said the Saudis were doing to gold,
[2:35:52.560 --> 2:35:56.000]  finish up with what the Saudis are doing with gold and oil right now to go after Russia
[2:35:56.000 --> 2:35:59.440]  and US shale producers.
[2:35:59.440 --> 2:36:03.040]  They're financing all the leftist groups against fracking and I'm not saying fracking doesn't
[2:36:03.040 --> 2:36:07.600]  cause problems folks, but the Saudis are funding it to try to shut off our industry, just like
[2:36:07.600 --> 2:36:12.960]  George Soros didn't want us to have the Keystone Pipeline so he could ship it by train to the
[2:36:12.960 --> 2:36:15.200]  west coast of Canada than to China.
[2:36:15.200 --> 2:36:19.880]  They make their empires out of manipulating markets, not out of being in the market.
[2:36:19.880 --> 2:36:23.880]  So explain to me like I'm five years old, what's happening with the bond market and
[2:36:23.880 --> 2:36:30.840]  why you're concerned about it, and then finish up with any other little schniblets or tidbits.
[2:36:30.840 --> 2:36:39.720]  Yeah, the bond market and the interest rate and let's look at that post 2008.
[2:36:39.720 --> 2:36:48.240]  We know that in 2008 there was a global financial crisis and what was decided to do was to try
[2:36:48.240 --> 2:36:51.920]  to make the cost of money cheaper.
[2:36:51.920 --> 2:36:55.480]  Money has a cost, it's called the interest rate, that's the price of money.
[2:36:55.480 --> 2:37:01.640]  So governments say in order to get this economy moving again, we need to lower the cost of
[2:37:01.640 --> 2:37:07.800]  money to get this money circulating so they engage in quantitative easing, which means
[2:37:07.800 --> 2:37:13.600]  that the government's buying back all of the bonds as much as they can get their hands
[2:37:13.600 --> 2:37:21.520]  on to drive up the price, the nominal price of that bond higher because what that means
[2:37:21.520 --> 2:37:25.080]  is that the yield goes lower.
[2:37:25.080 --> 2:37:29.280]  And so that lowers the cost of money, it makes the cost of money cheaper.
[2:37:29.280 --> 2:37:34.160]  And the theory is that when you make the price of money cheaper, you will get an economic
[2:37:34.160 --> 2:37:37.280]  recovery, you will get GDP growth.
[2:37:37.280 --> 2:37:44.840]  But what happened since 2008 is that they were the banks that were the beneficiaries
[2:37:44.840 --> 2:37:51.000]  of all of this activity, they did not lend it out, they just kept it for themselves.
[2:37:51.000 --> 2:37:59.960]  So there was no real GDP growth and here we are in 2014 and we see that the IMF just said
[2:37:59.960 --> 2:38:04.520]  the world is not growing at all, I mean, it's shrinking, there's deflation, there's
[2:38:04.520 --> 2:38:12.760]  no growth, there's GDP contraction because all of that attempt to make money cheaper
[2:38:12.760 --> 2:38:16.880]  by lowering rates by buying bonds has failed.
[2:38:16.880 --> 2:38:23.400]  So now we're at a point where they're talking in Washington about bringing in another program,
[2:38:23.400 --> 2:38:31.720]  another quantitative easing program, QE4, to try to once again drive the price of money,
[2:38:31.720 --> 2:38:33.960]  interest rates even lower.
[2:38:33.960 --> 2:38:40.480]  But am I incorrect from just my layman perspective to see the announcement of the end of QE unlimited
[2:38:40.480 --> 2:38:48.040]  for now that would end up long-term driving down bond market even as you see Europe imploding
[2:38:48.040 --> 2:38:54.840]  short-term driving up bond market which lowers yield, I see that as a net bad economic sign
[2:38:54.840 --> 2:38:57.800]  and as a bad investment and as bad news.
[2:38:57.800 --> 2:38:58.800]  Is that incorrect?
[2:38:58.800 --> 2:39:04.680]  We just said it's absolutely correct, the news that they were going to end quantitative
[2:39:04.680 --> 2:39:11.720]  easing in fact would have the effect of driving the bond prices down because that means they're
[2:39:11.720 --> 2:39:15.280]  not buying them anymore and so conversely what does that mean?
[2:39:15.280 --> 2:39:18.520]  Interest rates go up and higher interest rates being higher mortgage rates, higher credit
[2:39:18.520 --> 2:39:22.720]  card rates, higher refinancing rates and that's a negative on the economy.
[2:39:22.720 --> 2:39:26.160]  But the insiders don't care because they're going to continue to give themselves free
[2:39:26.160 --> 2:39:28.920]  money at 0%, we just don't get that.
[2:39:28.920 --> 2:39:34.280]  Goldman Sachs just came out with their quarterly earnings and they made a huge amount of money
[2:39:34.280 --> 2:39:35.280]  doing what?
[2:39:35.280 --> 2:39:41.040]  And they suddenly made a huge amount of money in their bond business because they're the
[2:39:41.040 --> 2:39:45.640]  ones that package all the bonds for the government to do quantitative easing.
[2:39:45.640 --> 2:39:48.080]  So they're the ones on TV.
[2:39:48.080 --> 2:39:53.160]  You predicted bond markets would start breaking up this year and I think your prediction is
[2:39:53.160 --> 2:39:54.160]  right.
[2:39:54.160 --> 2:39:58.000]  This looks like volatility breaking up, major problems, is that right?
[2:39:58.000 --> 2:40:04.240]  Yeah, it is, I mean in Europe it's breaking down and we're seeing now France as a
[2:40:04.240 --> 2:40:10.680]  as I mentioned earlier, there's been a duopoly with Germany and France, they've always been
[2:40:10.680 --> 2:40:14.200]  the core, the two strongest central European economies.
[2:40:14.200 --> 2:40:20.760]  Now France is going the way of Greece, irrefutably, so that means that the Euro, remember two
[2:40:20.760 --> 2:40:24.600]  or three years ago people were saying the Euro was going to break apart and never did.
[2:40:24.600 --> 2:40:29.360]  Well now that talk is back on the table because if France goes into the toilet that means
[2:40:29.360 --> 2:40:34.920]  Germany is being asked to finance the entire 17- That's right and they're signaling that
[2:40:34.920 --> 2:40:40.240]  they're getting ready to vote for very revolutionary governments and they're going to throw Merkel
[2:40:40.240 --> 2:40:41.240]  in all of them out.
[2:40:41.240 --> 2:40:44.600]  The Germans have been saddled with this, I don't think they're going to put up with
[2:40:44.600 --> 2:40:45.600]  it Max.
[2:40:45.600 --> 2:40:50.040]  No, the Germany could just as easily be the ones to declare that they're leaving the
[2:40:50.040 --> 2:40:53.280]  Eurozone and they're bringing back the Deutsche Mark.
[2:40:53.280 --> 2:40:54.280]  That could happen.
[2:40:54.280 --> 2:41:00.080]  The reason they haven't done it is because they benefit by having a screwed up Euro because
[2:41:00.080 --> 2:41:02.840]  it helps their export market because it keeps the Euro cheap.
[2:41:02.840 --> 2:41:08.160]  If they were a separate economy then the price of the Deutsche Mark would be a lot higher
[2:41:08.160 --> 2:41:09.160]  than it is now.
[2:41:09.160 --> 2:41:12.200]  Just like Switzerland, they'd have the same problem as the Swiss.
[2:41:12.200 --> 2:41:13.200]  Exactly.
[2:41:13.200 --> 2:41:14.200]  Exactly.
[2:41:14.200 --> 2:41:17.680]  So they've been playing both sides of the coin here, they've been enjoying the cheaper
[2:41:17.680 --> 2:41:22.720]  Euro for export and then as the peripheral economies like Greece are collapsing they move
[2:41:22.720 --> 2:41:27.680]  in to take over and they're trying to federalize the entire European zone and some people
[2:41:27.680 --> 2:41:28.680]  call it...
[2:41:28.680 --> 2:41:29.680]  Yes.
[2:41:29.680 --> 2:41:33.880]  It's the Vatican in Germany at the heart of the EU and so Germany can act like they're
[2:41:33.880 --> 2:41:39.880]  complaining on the surface but really it's economic warfare by Germany to basically bring
[2:41:39.880 --> 2:41:45.400]  down Europe and then bail everyone out with their own reverse Marshall plan thus dominating
[2:41:45.400 --> 2:41:46.400]  the Euro.
[2:41:46.400 --> 2:41:47.400]  Right.
[2:41:47.400 --> 2:41:49.520]  But in France it starts to really fall apart though.
[2:41:49.520 --> 2:41:52.880]  I think Germany may say, you know, we're getting the hell out of this.
[2:41:52.880 --> 2:41:57.360]  Oh yeah, the German people want out of it, that's in the polls, but the German elite
[2:41:57.360 --> 2:41:59.520]  are conquering economically right now.
[2:41:59.520 --> 2:42:03.960]  Okay, now to wrap this up, you referred to after the break you were talking about balls
[2:42:03.960 --> 2:42:10.800]  to the wall and how this related somehow to an East German wall division between East
[2:42:10.800 --> 2:42:11.800]  and West of Germany.
[2:42:11.800 --> 2:42:12.800]  That's completely false.
[2:42:12.800 --> 2:42:19.000]  If balls to the wall refers to balls deep, that's talking about the vaginal wall.
[2:42:19.000 --> 2:42:20.000]  That's enough.
[2:42:20.000 --> 2:42:21.000]  It's a family show.
[2:42:21.000 --> 2:42:22.000]  No, it doesn't.
[2:42:22.000 --> 2:42:23.000]  It is.
[2:42:23.000 --> 2:42:24.000]  And that is...
[2:42:24.000 --> 2:42:28.520]  Kaiser, you're always nice, you have a lot of good info, but you're also always stirring
[2:42:28.520 --> 2:42:34.680]  up trouble here on the show and it refers to the lever all the way to...
[2:42:34.680 --> 2:42:36.880]  That's a German protest song about the wall.
[2:42:36.880 --> 2:42:37.880]  That's on record.
[2:42:37.880 --> 2:42:41.400]  And it's also about going all the way to the wall, pedal the metal.
[2:42:41.400 --> 2:42:45.480]  That is from the 1930s, a aviator thing.
[2:42:45.480 --> 2:42:47.760]  Now somebody else may turn into something nasty.
[2:42:47.760 --> 2:42:49.920]  That's not our fault around here.
[2:42:49.920 --> 2:42:51.080]  Family show, Max.
[2:42:51.080 --> 2:42:54.360]  MaxKaiser.com, you're going to be on next week to follow this with us.
[2:42:54.360 --> 2:42:56.840]  Say hi to Stacy and everybody for us.
[2:42:56.840 --> 2:42:57.840]  Okay?
[2:42:57.840 --> 2:42:58.840]  Oh, hell yeah.
[2:42:58.840 --> 2:42:59.840]  Bye now.
[2:42:59.840 --> 2:43:00.840]  All right, there he goes.
[2:43:00.840 --> 2:43:05.400]  Always being a bad stockbroker, those guys are very bad behave like Wolf of Wall Street
[2:43:05.400 --> 2:43:06.400]  in their behavior.
[2:43:06.400 --> 2:43:09.840]  We apologize for that.
[2:43:09.840 --> 2:43:11.560]  Max Kaiser, they're joining us.
[2:43:11.560 --> 2:43:16.040]  I'm going to go to Ted Anderson here on the Gold Front, joining us via Videoskype.
[2:43:16.040 --> 2:43:19.160]  He's out in California right now with Gold up today.
[2:43:19.160 --> 2:43:20.760]  I want to get his take on that.
[2:43:20.760 --> 2:43:27.280]  But please don't forget, we've just relaunched the InfoWars Insider underground newsletter
[2:43:27.280 --> 2:43:32.720]  that has exclusive, I'm going to shoot after the show today, a breaking news video, whatever
[2:43:32.720 --> 2:43:37.520]  I think is most important, that will then be just in the newsletter, not even on YouTube.
[2:43:37.520 --> 2:43:42.880]  The latest breaking news, inside info, promo codes for products at infowarsstore.com and
[2:43:42.880 --> 2:43:43.880]  so much more.
[2:43:43.880 --> 2:43:48.220]  It's infowars.com forward slash newsletter.
[2:43:48.220 --> 2:43:52.280]  It's in the Alex Jones Show tab and you go there and you can see the exclusive videos
[2:43:52.280 --> 2:43:55.800]  and more and just put, you can see yesterday's exclusive video, and you just put in your

[2:44:02.920 --> 2:44:03.920]  newsletter.
[2:44:03.920 --> 2:44:08.240]  We'll also tweak that out on real Alex Jones right now.
[2:44:08.240 --> 2:44:14.800]  And lastly, I forgot to do this in the last hour, let me get over here and do this, I'm
[2:44:14.800 --> 2:44:21.000]  always forgetting this till deep into the show, so I kind of do it in a haphazard way.
[2:44:21.000 --> 2:44:27.440]  Three times a day, I take my drop of survival shield, nascent iodine, deep earth crystal
[2:44:27.440 --> 2:44:33.800]  source, I take my squirt of colloidal silver that I personally have been taking to try
[2:44:33.800 --> 2:44:35.920]  to boost my body's own defenses.
[2:44:35.920 --> 2:44:42.600]  I take the fluoride shield that is a known, a key later, and detoxifier not just for fluoride
[2:44:42.600 --> 2:44:47.920]  but a bunch of other toxins and heavy metals on record, and then super male vitality, because
[2:44:47.920 --> 2:44:53.920]  let me tell you, it is good to feel like a man, they have super female vitality as well,
[2:44:53.920 --> 2:44:59.520]  and if you'll just take my challenge and try the super male vitality, super female vitality,
[2:44:59.520 --> 2:45:04.360]  try the DNA force, try the survival shield X2, you will start detoxing in about two weeks
[2:45:04.360 --> 2:45:08.800]  in Philip, but after about three weeks, with most people it passes, some people don't have
[2:45:08.800 --> 2:45:13.600]  the detox headaches and things that comes with it, the oxy powder to flush out your
[2:45:13.600 --> 2:45:22.760]  guts, all of it available at infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139, and I like to mix it with
[2:45:22.760 --> 2:45:29.120]  water into a concoction, in fact here is my secret product that I've had for about four
[2:45:29.120 --> 2:45:33.440]  or five months that won't come out, because it's so hard to produce this, it's a new laboratory
[2:45:33.440 --> 2:45:39.080]  creation, let me mix that secret sauce in there, I forgot to take that and mix that
[2:45:39.080 --> 2:45:46.560]  up, this is a very famous vitamin that's well known that people inject, because you
[2:45:46.560 --> 2:45:51.240]  get 90 plus percent absorption and no one's come out with a pill form that absorbs anywhere
[2:45:51.240 --> 2:45:54.920]  near injections, well let me just give you a little newsflash, there's a reason we've
[2:45:54.920 --> 2:45:58.920]  been working on this a few years and I still don't have it out yet, because it takes some
[2:45:58.920 --> 2:46:06.240]  pretty serious laboratories to produce it, but let's just say this, I like it, so that
[2:46:06.240 --> 2:46:09.640]  will be available at infowarslife soon, we'll be able to tell you all about the secret,
[2:46:09.640 --> 2:46:18.600]  it's got secret in the name, I'll just leave it at that, so infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139,
[2:46:18.600 --> 2:46:22.640]  and all the products are right there on the site and your purchase supports the transmission,
[2:46:22.640 --> 2:46:26.040]  but if you'll just get some of the products and try them, we don't screen the calls, you've
[2:46:26.040 --> 2:46:32.200]  heard the rave reviews, quite frankly, we can't believe all we get is positive reviews,
[2:46:32.200 --> 2:46:37.040]  it's always able to complain or make stuff up, it's just nothing but positive, nothing
[2:46:37.040 --> 2:46:41.280]  but positive, and it's really simple stuff, why wouldn't somebody get a deep earth crystal
[2:46:41.280 --> 2:46:44.920]  source of iodine?
[2:46:44.920 --> 2:46:51.120]  Major drug manufacturers use it in some of their products, some of the hair care top
[2:46:51.120 --> 2:46:56.880]  lines get it, no one put it out as a supplement, we have the deep earth crystal source, no
[2:46:56.880 --> 2:47:04.560]  one else has it as a nutraceutical, and it's so affordable, it's X2 from infowarslife.com,
[2:47:04.560 --> 2:47:09.240]  and I just put it in water three times a day and it's life changing, what it's done for
[2:47:09.240 --> 2:47:15.080]  me, try it, try it, if you'll just try it you'll be blown away, with all the crazy stuff
[2:47:15.080 --> 2:47:19.920]  going on it's time to bolster our immune systems, alright, Ted Anderson joining us on short
[2:47:19.920 --> 2:47:25.520]  notice from California, the owner of the GCN radio network, he also is one of the biggest
[2:47:25.520 --> 2:47:29.240]  private gold dealers with a triple A rating from the Better Business Bureau, something
[2:47:29.240 --> 2:47:32.880]  you can't say of most other gold dealers out there, this is where I've been buying my
[2:47:32.880 --> 2:47:39.000]  gold for 20 years, about 19 years, he's been a sponsor for 19, I've worked in this time
[2:47:39.000 --> 2:47:43.880]  slot for 18 years, I never wanted to go up against Rush Limbaugh, Ted said no we're
[2:47:43.880 --> 2:47:47.640]  going to do it, he's got a monopoly in cities and a lot of stations want to have a show
[2:47:47.640 --> 2:47:52.080]  to go up against it, you're on here, not at night, if you want to work at this network,
[2:47:52.080 --> 2:47:56.040]  so here I am, and funny enough I'm now beating Rush Limbaugh in ratings wherever I'm put
[2:47:56.040 --> 2:48:01.360]  up against him, even on smaller stations, but that's a side issue, Ted Anderson's talked
[2:48:01.360 --> 2:48:06.320]  about the naked shorting, the trying to knock gold down the manipulation, other commodities
[2:48:06.320 --> 2:48:10.360]  like oil are imploding but gold is shooting up as elites hoard it, and that's all over
[2:48:10.360 --> 2:48:15.760]  mainstream news today, they may knock it down again, but I didn't sell gold I bought at
[2:48:15.760 --> 2:48:22.320]  $300 an ounce from Ted or $600 or $800 or $900 or $1,000, I quit buying at about $1,500,
[2:48:22.320 --> 2:48:27.700]  I've just been holding it for all these years, literally in a safe deposit box, as an emergency
[2:48:27.700 --> 2:48:31.480]  backup during total implosion, what am I doing now, buying more gold and silver, I got
[2:48:31.480 --> 2:48:35.760]  a bunch of silver too, now is the time, and I didn't mean to even get him on to pitch
[2:48:35.760 --> 2:48:41.800]  gold with Midas, but folks if you wait until the fall where it historically goes up, if
[2:48:41.800 --> 2:48:46.280]  you wait until there is a big rush, it's already up what 20 something bucks today, can we pull
[2:48:46.280 --> 2:48:52.240]  that up for me CNBC, now is the time I believe to get into gold and silver or at least get
[2:48:52.240 --> 2:48:57.800]  some of the books or financial prospectus documents that Midas Resources has, Ted what
[2:48:57.800 --> 2:49:03.280]  do you make of gold, how much is gold up today total Ted?
[2:49:03.280 --> 2:49:10.000]  Well presently right now gold is at just about 1241 and gold has been on the rise for the
[2:49:10.000 --> 2:49:16.720]  last four weeks, so yeah we came up at about 1180, so right now at this particular time
[2:49:16.720 --> 2:49:21.320]  gold is looking really good, and of course there are three indexes that fell right now,
[2:49:21.320 --> 2:49:27.600]  one was the retail sales fell 0.3% and the next thing was the producer price index which
[2:49:27.600 --> 2:49:33.800]  fell 0.1% and then there's the empire state index which fell 21 points, it's sort of like
[2:49:33.800 --> 2:49:40.720]  what Max Kaiser was saying, people are watching the economy melt apart now and it's not only
[2:49:40.720 --> 2:49:44.400]  just happening here in the United States but it's also happening in Europe, we've had a
[2:49:44.400 --> 2:49:50.520]  tremendous currency war that's been going on for the well since year 2008-2009, the
[2:49:50.520 --> 2:49:54.480]  United States has been trying to keep the value of the currency down like you said because
[2:49:54.480 --> 2:49:59.200]  we're printing money to keep the interest rates down which helps us with exports and
[2:49:59.200 --> 2:50:05.360]  helps us boost our economy, it's not working, the banks are holding on to the money and
[2:50:05.360 --> 2:50:10.280]  the economy never picked up again and so yeah we did see the Dow Jones industrial average
[2:50:10.280 --> 2:50:15.480]  just shoot up like crazy but now gold and silver start to show that there are problems
[2:50:15.480 --> 2:50:20.080]  in that particular market, Dow's starting to back off again and you're right about that
[2:50:20.080 --> 2:50:25.120]  Alex, now is the time to be getting in because the fundamentals are all there saying buy
[2:50:25.120 --> 2:50:32.000]  gold buy gold but at the same time the stock market and the bond market has been pushed
[2:50:32.000 --> 2:50:35.760]  by the central banks to push you know- Sure and to be clear gold's been going up the
[2:50:35.760 --> 2:50:41.480]  last few days, now it's flat, they're obviously trying to drive it down, my point is that
[2:50:41.480 --> 2:50:48.120]  people would just be crazy to not be getting in the gold and silver right now, I mean obviously
[2:50:48.120 --> 2:50:54.360]  the paper market is a complete joke and bubbles cannot just go on forever Ted- No, that's
[2:50:54.360 --> 2:50:57.680]  the whole thing, I mean the bond market is in one big bubble, they're pushing the real
[2:50:57.680 --> 2:51:03.160]  estate market back into a huge bubble again and now we're watching the Dow Jones industrial
[2:51:03.160 --> 2:51:08.720]  average fluctuate like it is and we're seeing 300 point drop you know in a day and that
[2:51:08.720 --> 2:51:13.560]  gets people nervous and the point is that the indexes right now are pointing at the
[2:51:13.560 --> 2:51:17.720]  fact that the United States economy is not growing and is not building up and there's
[2:51:17.720 --> 2:51:22.080]  been way too much money being pushed out into the marketplace by the Federal Reserve and
[2:51:22.080 --> 2:51:28.280]  other central banks, you know the United States has a ferocious appetite for economic stimulus
[2:51:28.280 --> 2:51:33.200]  and spending and our politicians are still spending way more than they have, they always
[2:51:33.200 --> 2:51:39.240]  turn to the printing press and yet we're able to see the gold market drop from about $19
[2:51:39.240 --> 2:51:45.360]  an ounce down to $1180 an ounce and finally now we're starting to see that stable point
[2:51:45.360 --> 2:51:50.160]  and it's building back up again, so at this point in time Alex is a good time to be getting
[2:51:50.160 --> 2:51:56.400]  into both gold and silver because of the fact that the behavior, if the behavior was different,
[2:51:56.400 --> 2:52:01.960]  if we had good economic times and conservative economic policy we'd be sitting here saying
[2:52:01.960 --> 2:52:07.000]  you know gold and silver may be stagnant for a while but it hasn't been that, it's been
[2:52:07.000 --> 2:52:13.360]  the exact opposite of that, we have had ferocious spending and a tremendous amount of printing
[2:52:13.360 --> 2:52:17.000]  of currency, the FET is you know QE1, QE2, QE3.
[2:52:17.000 --> 2:52:21.400]  Well for the type of inflation we've seen, a lot of mainline economists we've had on
[2:52:21.400 --> 2:52:26.040]  who aren't even gold or silver bugs have said silver should be $100, gold should be
[2:52:26.040 --> 2:52:33.000]  $3,500 an ounce, so they just cannot continue this forever and we haven't done this in like
[2:52:33.000 --> 2:52:37.080]  a year but I know that you're able to buy when it's low and so even when it goes up
[2:52:37.080 --> 2:52:41.360]  some or stabilizes you can pass on those savings, what are some of the best specials you've
[2:52:41.360 --> 2:52:47.240]  got right now at minus resources that people call on silver dollars, silver half dollars,
[2:52:47.240 --> 2:52:51.240]  what are some of the best deals you've got on gold coins that you can sell at bullion
[2:52:51.240 --> 2:52:55.200]  prices that I know have collectible value as well, that's my favorite buy is something
[2:52:55.200 --> 2:53:00.600]  that has collectible value, historic value that's recognized but also I can get near
[2:53:00.600 --> 2:53:01.600]  bullion prices.
[2:53:01.600 --> 2:53:06.400]  Well that would be, I mean the walking liberty half is a great coin in the silver arena
[2:53:06.400 --> 2:53:10.440]  because of the fact that you have something that is in finite supply that right now are
[2:53:10.440 --> 2:53:17.720]  trading at $11.77 on the collector side of it, the Frank coin is a coin that was issued
[2:53:17.720 --> 2:53:26.720]  in Europe and is at $273.22 and it is a coin that is dates back into the 1800s and then
[2:53:26.720 --> 2:53:32.320]  you have the British sovereign at $342.11 but there's a whole lot of different coins
[2:53:32.320 --> 2:53:38.000]  that you can be getting involved with, certainly the U.S. Eagle is very popular which is a
[2:53:38.000 --> 2:53:41.000]  coin that's going to be very close to now.
[2:53:41.000 --> 2:53:42.000]  I like buffaloes, you got any buffaloes?
[2:53:42.000 --> 2:53:45.280]  Yeah, the buffaloes are available still, that is a coin that's a little higher than the
[2:53:45.280 --> 2:53:50.240]  silver eagle but also very close to now, something that you can get into and no problem with
[2:53:50.240 --> 2:53:51.240]  liquidity.
[2:53:51.240 --> 2:53:54.280]  And you're still offering that deal on some of my films and other films where you then
[2:53:54.280 --> 2:54:00.080]  get two silver half dollars free just to get folks introduced to it, a lot of great
[2:54:00.080 --> 2:54:11.600]  stuff there available right now at www.minusresources.com or 800-686-2237, 800-686-2337 and again gold
[2:54:11.600 --> 2:54:15.600]  was up yesterday and today and now they've driven it back down to be flat so I was quoting
[2:54:15.600 --> 2:54:21.320]  old numbers there, just to me my gut tells me and it's rarely wrong, I mean what does
[2:54:21.320 --> 2:54:24.640]  your gut tell you Ted because we want to give out accurate info where I'm saying buy gold
[2:54:24.640 --> 2:54:29.080]  my gut tells me, I mean I just feel really good about the gold and silver I hold because
[2:54:29.080 --> 2:54:33.760]  even if I bought it at $500, even if they drove it down to $1,300 or $1,200 and it's
[2:54:33.760 --> 2:54:39.360]  starting to go back up, it doesn't matter, it's real, it's used industrially, you know
[2:54:39.360 --> 2:54:43.240]  just like stocks and rare earth minerals I think long term are good, I wouldn't invest
[2:54:43.240 --> 2:54:48.080]  in prison stocks but I've always said if you're immoral buy more, those have only gone up,
[2:54:48.080 --> 2:54:51.440]  same thing with Apple or Google or whatever, I mean this stuff's really a no brainer if
[2:54:51.440 --> 2:54:56.600]  you're a long term holder of things that are central but I mean does your gut, what
[2:54:56.600 --> 2:55:04.320]  are you thinking personally, I think we're going to see a bear market in stocks and a
[2:55:04.320 --> 2:55:07.360]  bull market in metals this winter.
[2:55:07.360 --> 2:55:12.480]  Well that's what I'm looking for Alex because that was very clear that it's hard to predict
[2:55:12.480 --> 2:55:17.400]  what's going to happen in the future but when we had that $1,900 gold and $50 silver and
[2:55:17.400 --> 2:55:21.080]  you're watching the central banks get in there and manipulate, it was pretty clear that
[2:55:21.080 --> 2:55:24.600]  what they later admitted in the mainstream news, it was rigged, they did drive it down,
[2:55:24.600 --> 2:55:25.600]  it is rigged.
[2:55:25.600 --> 2:55:29.600]  Yeah, of course that's their focus, that's what the central banks are designed to do
[2:55:29.600 --> 2:55:34.280]  is to manipulate markets, that's their very charter but right now at this particular time
[2:55:34.280 --> 2:55:38.240]  they're starting to lose control, they've been able to create this bubble, this bubble
[2:55:38.240 --> 2:55:42.960]  is going to pop, that will create a very good market for gold and silver, that's when we
[2:55:42.960 --> 2:55:47.360]  start to see that rise, I hope that we don't get pushed into a huge bubble in gold and
[2:55:47.360 --> 2:55:51.960]  silver just because too many people get hurt but right now at this particular time we're
[2:55:51.960 --> 2:55:56.200]  at the bottom end of the market and it's a good time to start quietly getting into that
[2:55:56.200 --> 2:56:00.760]  market and accumulating and like you said Alex, if you're buying for the long term and
[2:56:00.760 --> 2:56:04.440]  you're taking physical delivery of the silver and gold that you have, it really doesn't
[2:56:04.440 --> 2:56:06.320]  matter if it's fluctuating up or down.
[2:56:06.320 --> 2:56:10.320]  Well see, this is when I buy is when it hits the bottom and starts going back up and I
[2:56:10.320 --> 2:56:15.800]  see other indicators that mean it's going to go up, that's when I buy is when nobody
[2:56:15.800 --> 2:56:20.520]  else says except the elite, I mean it's in the news, you can type in ultra rich hoarding
[2:56:20.520 --> 2:56:26.000]  gold, institutions hoarding gold, well I'm going to do what the smart insiders do and
[2:56:26.000 --> 2:56:30.600]  it doesn't mean it's silver bulleter, perfect but I mean it's just what my gut tells me
[2:56:30.600 --> 2:56:34.520]  to do, I'm going to be giving you a call or your brokers today Ted myself, probably get
[2:56:34.520 --> 2:56:36.760]  a little bit of silver, a little bit of gold, I just bought a little here, a little there
[2:56:36.760 --> 2:56:44.600]  over the years, it builds into something really just for my children, 800-686-2237, I just
[2:56:44.600 --> 2:56:50.640]  got a wild hair today, I said hey where's Ted, oh he's in California, got you on because
[2:56:50.640 --> 2:56:54.320]  I may be wrong because they can manipulate things but I think now after a year of not
[2:56:54.320 --> 2:57:00.680]  promoting this, I think now's the time to get in folks, 800-686-2237, 800-686-2237.
[2:57:00.680 --> 2:57:04.080]  Ted Anderson, thank you so much for spending time with us.
[2:57:04.080 --> 2:57:05.680]  Yeah, thanks for having me up Alex.
[2:57:05.680 --> 2:57:09.080]  You're always welcome to come to Austin and your club trotting and be in studio with us.
[2:57:09.080 --> 2:57:10.280]  I will come right down.
[2:57:10.280 --> 2:57:13.040]  Alright, thank you so much, there goes Ted Anderson.
[2:57:13.040 --> 2:57:17.680]  I'm out of time for today's show, I skipped a couple breaks because I get so hyper, fabulous
[2:57:17.680 --> 2:57:26.440]  job to the crew, we've got some really big guests coming up, I like Max Kaiser, he listens
[2:57:26.440 --> 2:57:30.760]  to the show religiously, he really is a smart guy but he also knows I have a very conservative
[2:57:30.760 --> 2:57:38.080]  audience, he likes to be naughty, I apologize for that, he's a big kid and AP produces his
[2:57:38.080 --> 2:57:41.440]  show, he's going to be in town for a month soon, I think he's going to be doing it out
[2:57:41.440 --> 2:57:44.800]  of our studios, I got to be honest, I don't know if I can handle Kaiser around here for
[2:57:44.800 --> 2:57:49.280]  a month folks, he's just, I like him but it's like a Loki or something, I don't know if
[2:57:49.280 --> 2:57:54.040]  we can have Loki in the building for a full month, we have to hang some garlic up around
[2:57:54.040 --> 2:57:58.680]  the doorways and I'm just joking, he's a great guy, I'm just messing with him, he
[2:57:58.680 --> 2:58:07.200]  always teases me but I may tape a special report on Gary Webb and Kill the Messenger,
[2:58:07.200 --> 2:58:15.680]  I was so shook up by the film last night because just the lost opportunity of helping him and
[2:58:15.680 --> 2:58:20.920]  the lost opportunity of getting to know him better, when he was just, because I'm not
[2:58:20.920 --> 2:58:24.680]  like bragging, there's a big movie about this guy, I interviewed him probably 15 times or
[2:58:24.680 --> 2:58:29.180]  more, he wanted me to build him a website, he wanted to work with me because everybody
[2:58:29.180 --> 2:58:34.320]  else had turned their back on him, it's just bizarre and now I'm watching this movie remembering
[2:58:34.320 --> 2:58:39.000]  it all, I just take so much for granted, I hope folks don't take this show for granted
[2:58:39.000 --> 2:58:43.040]  or take the drudge reports for granted or anybody else telling the truth because the
[2:58:43.040 --> 2:58:47.480]  system is coming after us, the White House attacked us twice this week through Media
[2:58:47.480 --> 2:58:48.480]  Matters.
[2:58:48.480 --> 2:58:57.640]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road but if the unfortunate
[2:58:57.640 --> 2:59:01.920]  happens you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[2:59:01.920 --> 2:59:11.320]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans, they so pride
[2:59:11.320 --> 2:59:20.560]  in every stitch, guarantee you love the way they fit, they put a diamond gusset in the
[2:59:20.560 --> 2:59:28.680]  crotch where you need it most, blue diamond gussets got it, other stone.

[2:59:35.480 --> 2:59:40.080]  our Defender motorcycle jeans combine gusset comfort with Kevlar protection so you can
