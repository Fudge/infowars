[00:00.000 --> 00:12.760]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.760 --> 00:21.520]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:21.520 --> 00:34.840]  it rarely happens I have done thousands and thousands and thousands of radio
[00:34.840 --> 00:38.560]  broadcasts thousands and thousands of radio interviews hundreds and hundreds
[00:38.560 --> 00:43.320]  of TV interviews over the years and I really never get butterflies I never
[00:43.320 --> 00:47.940]  really get nervous even before speaking to a crowd of 5,000 people it's
[00:47.940 --> 00:52.920]  televised I don't get nervous when I've been on Good Morning America I don't get
[00:52.920 --> 00:57.680]  nervous when I'm on CNN or Fox I am extremely nervous right now I am
[00:57.680 --> 01:05.040]  extremely fired up and at the same time focused because we are going to launch
[01:05.040 --> 01:10.720]  something today in the face of the complete criminal takeover of our
[01:10.720 --> 01:17.040]  society that if you decide to take action that if you decide to give this
[01:17.040 --> 01:23.600]  idea power and momentum it is going to shake the foundations of the new world
[01:23.600 --> 01:28.560]  order crime syndicate that we've already had such great effects against
[01:28.560 --> 01:34.360]  together we are locked in a titanic struggle of good versus evil of liberty
[01:34.360 --> 01:41.400]  versus tyranny of freedom versus slavery and despotism now congressman Ron Paul
[01:41.400 --> 01:44.880]  is joining us in 30 minutes then Paul Joseph Watson is going to be with us
[01:44.880 --> 01:48.600]  with some key announcements that we're also going to have coming up in the
[01:48.600 --> 01:58.000]  last hour Joel Scalzen but last night in the face of DHS putting out public
[01:58.000 --> 02:04.680]  service announcements openly telling citizens to further spy on each other
[02:04.680 --> 02:09.840]  that anyone buying things with cash may be a terrorist with the DHS admitting
[02:09.840 --> 02:13.480]  they're going to put TSA at sports stadiums and malls which they said they
[02:13.480 --> 02:18.040]  do years ago but now they're rolling it out in the face of the FEMA 10
[02:18.040 --> 02:23.320]  governorship expansion the threat fusion centers the states what we told you
[02:23.320 --> 02:27.040]  years ago now announcing that they're preparing to go bankrupt into federal
[02:27.040 --> 02:33.120]  receivership itself into IMF World Bank OECD receivership with all of this
[02:33.120 --> 02:36.960]  happening with the Chinese visiting and saying the days of the dollar are doomed
[02:36.960 --> 02:41.400]  with Henry Kissinger announcing on Charlie Rose two nights ago that the new
[02:41.400 --> 02:45.960]  world order is now being born through the economic crisis they engineered he
[02:45.960 --> 02:49.720]  left that part out though he said through the economic crisis we are at the
[02:49.720 --> 02:53.320]  crossroads right now we've been moving into that zone for a long time but now
[02:53.320 --> 02:58.600]  is the crossroads and it's time to launch a major information warfare
[02:58.600 --> 03:04.080]  peaceful resistance to this now and it is important that this information I'm
[03:04.080 --> 03:11.320]  going to cover when we come back from break explodes dynamically and immediately and
[03:11.320 --> 03:15.240]  that there be a chain reaction doing this people are always saying Alex
[03:15.240 --> 03:20.240]  mobilize us Alex you know give us marching orders Alex we want to hit the
[03:20.240 --> 03:26.720]  streets well I've got a peaceful program to do that a double pronged to pronged
[03:26.720 --> 03:34.120]  penser attack against the globalist that we're going to be discussing coming up
[03:34.120 --> 03:37.800]  in the next segment for the next two segments ahead of Congressman Ron Paul
[03:37.800 --> 03:42.080]  scheduled to be joining us from his Lake Jackson office he's got an event down
[03:42.080 --> 03:48.880]  there tonight I'm told this is so important evil is rising but for any
[03:48.880 --> 03:52.960]  action there is an equal and opposite reaction that is the law of the universe
[03:52.960 --> 03:59.440]  and we must rise now and really get aggressive against the globalist and
[03:59.440 --> 04:04.600]  what we do now may take weeks months or even a year to unfold just like what I
[04:04.600 --> 04:08.920]  launched over a year ago with the operations exposing the TSA's plan to
[04:08.920 --> 04:14.200]  take over society via DHS how the airports are the training grounds to
[04:14.200 --> 04:18.960]  begin the brainwashing it takes time to build movements systematic ripples in
[04:18.960 --> 04:23.160]  the pond from the pebbles we throw in we're going to throw a boulder in today
[04:23.160 --> 04:26.700]  you go back over a year ago and then about nine months ago we launched two
[04:26.700 --> 04:32.080]  different operations exposing the fake tear exposing the DHS and TSA is
[04:32.080 --> 04:35.480]  taking over that they're training you to be a slave and have them stick their
[04:35.480 --> 04:40.640]  hands down your pants now look at them in retreat
[04:40.640 --> 04:47.200]  polls over 90 percent against it a poll just out nationally in Germany eighty
[04:47.200 --> 04:51.000]  nine point five percent believe nine eleven's an inside job the awakening is
[04:51.000 --> 04:55.120]  here but it takes time but what we're about to launch if you take action will
[04:55.120 --> 04:59.800]  be the single greatest devastating blow this info wars operation has ever
[04:59.800 --> 05:04.200]  launched diamond gusset is proud to announce the anthem of the patriot
[05:04.200 --> 05:07.840]  movement they're offering a free CD t-shirt and bumper sticker with a

[05:54.720 --> 06:01.720]  again go to gusset dot-com forward slash America today this is Alex Jones with
[06:01.720 --> 06:05.480]  five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator number
[06:05.480 --> 06:09.080]  one new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric
[06:09.080 --> 06:13.400]  bill number two our new energies are wants to control how much power your
[06:13.400 --> 06:17.360]  electric company allows you to have it's true total government control of
[06:17.360 --> 06:21.760]  electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming number three in
[06:21.760 --> 06:26.040]  some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new
[06:26.040 --> 06:29.800]  socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four
[06:29.800 --> 06:33.920]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of
[06:33.920 --> 06:37.880]  families lose their power from weather related onages number five a solar power
[06:37.880 --> 06:41.720]  generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks I
[06:41.720 --> 06:44.440]  really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions from
[06:44.440 --> 06:50.440]  science one of my oldest sponsors you can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com
[06:50.440 --> 06:54.960]  that's my solar backup dot-com remember the government doesn't own the Sun so go
[06:54.960 --> 07:02.160]  to my solar backup dot-com or call 1-877-327-0365 you've heard Alex
[07:02.160 --> 07:05.840]  explain how the silver lungs generator infuses the respiratory system with
[07:05.840 --> 07:09.680]  your self-produced colloidal silver solutions yet many are unaware of the
[07:09.680 --> 07:12.840]  entire function of the silver lung system and how it has been designed to
[07:12.840 --> 07:17.640]  deliver your silver solutions anywhere in or on the body my name is Mario
[07:17.640 --> 07:22.200]  Sepaldi and I'm the developer of the silver lungs generator not only does the
[07:22.200 --> 07:26.320]  silver lung system produce endless colloidal and ionic silver solutions it
[07:26.320 --> 07:30.200]  also comes equipped with the proper applicators and devices needed to
[07:30.200 --> 07:35.040]  deliver your silver solutions directly to key target areas this includes the
[07:35.040 --> 07:41.640]  eyes ears nose lungs topically to the skin and orally for the digestive system
[07:41.640 --> 07:46.040]  be sure to watch our new seven-minute video tour of the silver lung system at
[07:46.040 --> 07:53.000]  www.silverlungs.com to learn more about how the silver lung system works as well
[07:53.000 --> 08:01.520]  we are always ready to answer any questions you may have that's www.silverlungs.com
[08:02.880 --> 08:09.760]  I have sworn upon the altar of God eternal hostility against every form of
[08:09.760 --> 08:17.160]  tyranny over the mind of man Thomas Jefferson it's Alex Jones on the GCN
[08:17.160 --> 08:28.560]  radio network it is Friday January 21st 2011 and let this be a day remembered
[08:28.560 --> 08:37.080]  for a long time to come that we launched operation the answer to 1984 is 1776 and
[08:37.080 --> 08:45.400]  at the heart of it is the sub operation V for victory where does that term come
[08:45.400 --> 08:49.280]  from you see it in movies like V for vendetta but where does it come from the
[08:49.280 --> 08:54.160]  French resistance started spray painting and painting and carving and posting
[08:54.160 --> 08:59.640]  things all over Germany to unify the population through a peaceful movement
[08:59.640 --> 09:04.000]  of solidarity that they did not agree with the VG French that it collaborated
[09:04.000 --> 09:08.320]  with the Nazis and helped overthrow France during the German invasion that
[09:08.320 --> 09:13.600]  was an inside job our country has been taken over by offshore banks who have
[09:13.600 --> 09:17.640]  bankrupted hundreds of third world countries in the last hundred years by
[09:17.640 --> 09:22.680]  design with the same system they're now using against our Republic going in
[09:22.680 --> 09:25.840]  buying off the politicians getting them to buy into debt getting them to
[09:25.840 --> 09:31.120]  underwrite derivatives devaluing currencies this is all being done by
[09:31.120 --> 09:36.160]  design as Greece has fallen as Ireland is falling as Greenland has partially
[09:36.160 --> 09:41.120]  fallen the world is waking up and resisting this and they plan to do the
[09:41.120 --> 09:47.480]  same thing to the United States in 2002 in March Greg Pallist of BBC
[09:47.480 --> 09:52.560]  television got the secret documents out of the IMF and World Bank right at the
[09:52.560 --> 09:56.280]  time that Joseph Stiglitz Nobel Prize winner for economists for economics quit
[09:56.280 --> 10:00.200]  he claims he didn't release them how they were planning to implode the Western
[10:00.200 --> 10:05.240]  world just as they had done the third world now for over eight years I have
[10:05.240 --> 10:10.040]  warned you of the time that we are now entering this is a huge announcement
[10:10.040 --> 10:15.200]  here it is in front of us a path is sought for states to escape their debt
[10:15.200 --> 10:19.320]  burdens New York Times oh to escape their debt burdens with the unfunded
[10:19.320 --> 10:23.120]  mandates the federal government is going to accelerate the quantitative easing
[10:23.120 --> 10:28.320]  the monetization of debt passed 130 billion a month to 200 billion dollars
[10:28.320 --> 10:32.920]  a month or even more of your tax money not only will it devalue our currencies
[10:32.920 --> 10:37.600]  but it creates a debt black hole that is impossible to escape and then we owe
[10:37.600 --> 10:40.960]  this to the offshore banks openly announcing a world government run by
[10:40.960 --> 10:47.360]  them we have to pay it back in taxes and it devalues our currency the Chinese
[10:47.360 --> 10:51.560]  come here and openly put us down and say we own your debt and we're going to get
[10:51.560 --> 10:55.480]  off the dollar and our currency is going to be the World Reserve currency this
[10:55.480 --> 11:02.600]  will not just impoverish us it will implode the geopolitical system that
[11:02.600 --> 11:08.200]  has been and bring us into this authoritarian world government ladies and
[11:08.200 --> 11:12.480]  gentlemen we launched over a year ago TSA demonstrations with posters and
[11:12.480 --> 11:17.000]  videos and and got our listeners going with those contest and it caused massive
[11:17.000 --> 11:22.680]  effects and then created ripples that have grown into the huge resistance that
[11:22.680 --> 11:26.040]  is teaching people how to come together against tyranny against the TSA
[11:26.040 --> 11:30.400]  absurdities of putting their hands down our pants of the body scanners now as
[11:30.400 --> 11:35.520]  we told you the Homeland Security's putting out TV ads in the style of soap
[11:35.520 --> 11:39.520]  operas showing citizens spying on each other anybody that buys things with cash
[11:39.520 --> 11:42.880]  call the police on them if you see a cardboard box on the side of the road
[11:42.880 --> 11:48.040]  call the bomb squad it's creating hysteria every hour I see articles around
[11:48.040 --> 11:52.360]  the country with highways buildings shut down people panicking over a tin can
[11:52.360 --> 11:56.640]  on the side of the street trying to create this culture of fear so that we
[11:56.640 --> 12:00.480]  will accept the unfolding police state that's meant to suppress the population
[12:00.480 --> 12:05.680]  as the economy is publicly imploded as they admit what they've done but offer
[12:05.680 --> 12:12.440]  more globalist control as the solution now I was going to launch today and it's
[12:12.440 --> 12:15.800]  going to be up at info wars.com and prison planet.com the next hour Kurt's
[12:15.800 --> 12:21.640]  getting it together the answer to 1984 1776 contest and obviously people want
[12:21.640 --> 12:26.280]  to make videos exposing TSA exposing the globalist and the DHS rollout on the
[12:26.280 --> 12:32.200]  streets to expose this new world order occupation this banker takeover but we
[12:32.200 --> 12:36.720]  have the contest element so that those that do the best job demonstrating
[12:36.720 --> 12:41.920]  protesting making videos doing banner hangs posting flyers get recognition and
[12:41.920 --> 12:46.360]  adds an element of competition to it then I was talking to Paul Watson last
[12:46.360 --> 12:50.120]  night and I was I called him in about six midnight his time he was still up
[12:50.120 --> 12:54.320]  working and I said Watson over at prison planet.com over in England I said
[12:54.320 --> 13:00.200]  Watson they are rolling out these these TV soap opera many documentaries for
[13:00.200 --> 13:04.480]  television these are also going to air on 9,000 telescreens going up
[13:04.480 --> 13:08.920]  nationwide at 9,000 locations more than 9,000 individual screens where it shows
[13:08.920 --> 13:12.720]  people in these situations spying on each other we've got a counter this and he
[13:12.720 --> 13:17.720]  said yes why don't we just have people post V's everywhere because he's been
[13:17.720 --> 13:20.760]  reading a book and of course I'm familiar with it as well most of you are
[13:20.760 --> 13:24.880]  about the French resistance peacefully showing solidarity and that the people
[13:24.880 --> 13:30.440]  knew that they were occupied all over Germany putting you know V's on walls
[13:30.440 --> 13:36.760]  V's on Nazi vehicles posters hung everywhere scratching them on the side
[13:36.760 --> 13:43.280]  of you know bar room tables and it it it really began to brought to bring down
[13:43.280 --> 13:48.800]  the Germans in France even before the D-Day invasion and liberation America is
[13:48.800 --> 13:54.120]  occupied by outside banking cartels and we are writing articles explaining that
[13:54.120 --> 13:59.640]  we I'm gonna produce videos breaking that down tied to the V symbol that we're
[13:59.640 --> 14:04.040]  gonna post and and show you right now for prison planet TV viewers but the
[14:04.040 --> 14:11.440]  article is up on info wars.com right now and and we'll put that article up on
[14:11.440 --> 14:16.800]  screen and also show you these V's that Phil and I put together last night and
[14:16.800 --> 14:21.440]  gave to Watson this morning the article is you are the resistance against the
[14:21.440 --> 14:30.560]  DHS occupation of America and it's a big V black V's white V's red V's pick
[14:30.560 --> 14:35.160]  whichever one you like it says info wars.com under it then it has a short
[14:35.160 --> 14:42.080]  message under it that simply states we are all in danger a police state
[14:42.080 --> 14:45.800]  control grid is being established the United States now is the time for all

[15:06.640 --> 15:10.240]  they cover these flyers going up in their areas and of course the news will
[15:10.240 --> 15:13.200]  attack it and say it's evil which will further prove their police state
[15:13.200 --> 15:17.760]  mechanisms we did this with the Obama poster contest that was on hundreds of
[15:17.760 --> 15:22.920]  TV stations and hundreds of newspapers in the US Latin America Europe England
[15:22.920 --> 15:28.680]  the Netherlands Japan and you saw the tens of millions of people that saw all
[15:28.680 --> 15:32.720]  the videos produced by our listeners of them posting the flyers are doing the
[15:32.720 --> 15:38.040]  banner hangs or other inventive things to get local debate about what is what
[15:38.040 --> 15:42.440]  are people talking about then the news will play clips of me talking here
[15:42.440 --> 15:47.080]  they'll go get it off YouTube later they will go over what we're talking about
[15:47.080 --> 15:52.640]  and put our message out for us and cause a huge buzz that will then cause more
[15:52.640 --> 15:58.280]  ripples the DHS understands the power of getting the people involved in their
[15:58.280 --> 16:03.240]  evil that's why they're running contest right now for folks to produce videos

[26:26.600 --> 26:30.520]  there's no doubt about what's happening as we told you they do the same thing in
[26:30.520 --> 26:33.960]  every other nation they take control of the central government they bankrupt the
[26:33.960 --> 26:38.960]  states the provinces the sectors and then they bring it into international
[26:38.960 --> 26:42.920]  receivership and instead of paying the nation paying 5 10% for the debt to the
[26:42.920 --> 26:46.560]  bankers it's made up out of nothing you start paying 15 20 30 then it's more
[26:46.560 --> 26:50.400]  impossible to pay then it's even higher than a billion dollar debt could turn
[26:50.400 --> 26:54.480]  into 100 billion they claim we owe 14 plus trillion of these bankers and it's
[26:54.480 --> 27:00.000]  all made up but they say too big to fail give us everything give us your land the
[27:00.000 --> 27:03.920]  EU admittedly was a receivership arm they said Ireland was the wealthiest per
[27:03.920 --> 27:07.920]  capita country you know doing so great then a month after they went under EU
[27:07.920 --> 27:10.920]  control they're bankrupted and everything's handed over to the bankers

[27:14.960 --> 27:19.080]  same things happening here Iceland staying no we have to be an example
[27:19.080 --> 27:23.440]  worldwide instead of America being an example of decadence and corruption and

[29:00.680 --> 29:06.000]  over the news and it will cause a bigger explosion of this info but we got to move
[29:06.000 --> 29:09.160]  quick because we learned earlier the orders will start going out to tell
[29:09.160 --> 29:12.480]  media not to cover this so we got to hit them hard before the next few days when
[29:12.480 --> 29:15.720]  they get the orders trickling down locally not to cover this and that'll

[33:34.680 --> 33:40.560]  congressman happy new year to you thank you same to you there's so much to talk
[33:40.560 --> 33:46.040]  about here out of the gates you're now the chairman of that banking subcommittee
[33:46.040 --> 33:50.680]  dealing with the Federal Reserve and it couldn't be a more perfect time as the
[33:50.680 --> 33:54.160]  New York Times announces the federal government is preparing to basically
[33:54.160 --> 33:59.360]  take the states in under receivership and their bankruptcy and as the Chinese
[33:59.360 --> 34:02.960]  openly say that it's time for the dollar to not be the World Reserve currency
[34:02.960 --> 34:06.680]  can you speak to your concerns a few years ago you said something big is
[34:06.680 --> 34:12.520]  about to happen are we now on the cusp of that we certainly are and it's going
[34:12.520 --> 34:17.120]  to get a lot worse even though we had this major crisis starting in 0708 I
[34:17.120 --> 34:21.400]  thought that was just the beginning because the real crisis comes with
[34:21.400 --> 34:24.920]  with the dollar when people lose confidence in the dollar the dollar
[34:24.920 --> 34:29.200]  doesn't deserve confidence that it has but you can put confidence in something
[34:29.200 --> 34:33.960]  that isn't real if you're deceived and people are deceived that we are very
[34:33.960 --> 34:38.800]  wealthy and we have a great military and therefore we can trust the United States
[34:38.800 --> 34:44.640]  because of our past performances but eventually that is eroded and people
[34:44.640 --> 34:48.240]  will reject it and I think that we're witnessing that with the Chinese the
[34:48.240 --> 34:54.220]  Chinese have it sadly I guess in a way they have become more capitalistic than
[34:54.220 --> 34:57.320]  ours I don't care about them becoming more capitalistic but I don't like the
[34:57.320 --> 35:01.720]  idea that we become more militaristic and more socialistic that's what's so bad
[35:01.720 --> 35:06.000]  but they they have their problems in China but just think of what they've done
[35:06.000 --> 35:09.920]  they produce and they save money they take the money and they buy up resources
[35:09.920 --> 35:13.960]  around the world they buy gold they're a wealthy country they loan us all this
[35:13.960 --> 35:18.480]  money they're in the driver's seat don't you think that if you or I or any
[35:18.480 --> 35:23.160]  American was involved in that we wouldn't be wanting to just be taking paper
[35:23.160 --> 35:26.880]  money that they know is going to depreciate there would be a limit and I
[35:26.880 --> 35:31.120]  think we're at that point and when that happens that will be a major event when
[35:31.120 --> 35:36.540]  when the world rejects the dollar so when it comes and how it comes and how
[35:36.540 --> 35:40.680]  quickly it comes those are still unknowns but it will come and I think
[35:40.680 --> 35:46.840]  we're starting it to see it happen right now absolutely congressman as a doctor
[35:46.840 --> 35:49.600]  as a congressperson as someone who's been on the banking committees for many
[35:49.600 --> 35:56.680]  years and studied Austrian economics for those that don't know comparing our
[35:56.680 --> 36:00.440]  situation to the Weimar Republic I see a lot of similarities we're already
[36:00.440 --> 36:06.240]  seeing inflation in commodities and inflation in food what is the basic
[36:06.240 --> 36:09.880]  time frame that you see currently and and and for those that don't know what
[36:09.880 --> 36:13.800]  does dollar devaluation and the dollar losing World Reserve currency status
[36:13.800 --> 36:17.920]  mean for people well it means higher prices and eventually higher interest
[36:17.920 --> 36:24.920]  rates which means higher prices again but the government always reports
[36:24.920 --> 36:30.240]  statistics that are deceiving and they tell us that inflation is like one and a half
[36:30.240 --> 36:34.600]  two percent and yet if you talk to the average person they know that prices
[36:34.600 --> 36:37.720]  going up and you're right about the commodity there was a report yesterday I
[36:37.720 --> 36:42.560]  think it was the FMP commodity index for last year a whole group of commodities
[36:42.560 --> 36:49.560]  it was up at 24 percent that's huge and you can't have that and not have that
[36:49.560 --> 36:55.320]  translate into you know day-to-day living and people know this the energy prices
[36:55.320 --> 36:59.640]  are are going to go up and it wouldn't take much to push that oil up over a
[36:59.640 --> 37:04.040]  hundred dollars it's bouncing around there already and which means the
[37:04.040 --> 37:09.280]  standard of living goes down you know with if an individual borrows and they
[37:09.280 --> 37:12.760]  get into debt but they live high on the hog and they buy more cars than they
[37:12.760 --> 37:16.640]  need and have a fancy house and their job is just marginal but if they lose
[37:16.640 --> 37:21.920]  their job or prices go up they get wiped out and they have to in order to get back
[37:21.920 --> 37:25.680]  on their feet again they have to work harder and spend less it's a little
[37:25.680 --> 37:29.160]  different different with a country because they have this printing press
[37:29.160 --> 37:34.400]  and they're able to tax people but there is a limit but the economic law is the
[37:34.400 --> 37:38.360]  same for the country as it is for the individual the country eventually has
[37:38.360 --> 37:42.720]  to live beneath its means and that's what we're witnessing now and it usually
[37:42.720 --> 37:46.320]  hits some people more than others so the middle class and the poor get hit the
[37:46.320 --> 37:50.640]  first they lose their jobs and they're hurt the most through the inflation the
[37:50.640 --> 37:54.840]  very wealthy actually there's a transfer of wealth this has been argued by
[37:54.840 --> 38:00.840]  Austrian economists for decades that when you destroy a currency it erodes the
[38:00.840 --> 38:04.320]  value of the currency but the middle class suffer the most and the wealth is
[38:04.320 --> 38:09.920]  accumulated by the very rich and we see that we're seeing that and what does it
[38:09.920 --> 38:14.960]  do it drives up resentment you know PNP if they don't fully understand this the
[38:14.960 --> 38:18.880]  middle class is getting wiped out that they only have anger and they might
[38:18.880 --> 38:22.880]  strike out if everybody who has wealth rather than the wealth that has been
[38:22.880 --> 38:28.160]  accumulated because of the government programs and the social engineers as you
[38:28.160 --> 38:33.040]  know dr. Paul congressman they're fully aware of that the pressure from above
[38:33.040 --> 38:37.400]  and below and so right when they got rid of the glass steel 11 years ago we
[38:37.400 --> 38:40.880]  start seeing ran corporation reports we start seeing department of defense
[38:40.880 --> 38:45.880]  reports saying we've got to basically set up a police state because there's a
[38:45.880 --> 38:52.320]  danger of social unrest coming because of the dwindling middle class and now we
[38:52.320 --> 38:57.800]  see a British Ministry of Defense report saying the same thing in 2007 and low
[38:57.800 --> 39:02.800]  and behold now Homeland Security's putting in in 9,000 locations telescreens
[39:02.800 --> 39:07.400]  saying watch your neighbors with three new videos were released yesterday if
[39:07.400 --> 39:11.800]  frightening videos by Homeland Security airing on TV they're up on info wars
[39:11.800 --> 39:14.320]  calm and present planet calm of listeners want to see it or if the
[39:14.320 --> 39:18.360]  congressman hasn't seen it and it's got people in shopping malls and on the
[39:18.360 --> 39:23.720]  streets and it shows DHS TSA on the streets searching people and it says
[39:23.720 --> 39:27.680]  we're going to protect you but we need you to watch your neighbors I mean
[39:27.680 --> 39:32.600]  clearly they're trying to bring in an authoritarian system not for Al Qaeda or
[39:32.600 --> 39:38.340]  these overseas reported threats but they're now shifting it over to domestic
[39:38.340 --> 39:41.840]  groups and we saw that attempt to attack conservatives and libertarians and
[39:41.840 --> 39:46.480]  yourself and myself and even Sarah Palin and Rush Limbaugh and talk radio in
[39:46.480 --> 39:52.040]  the first amendment after the tragic shooting so can you speak to that sir
[39:52.040 --> 39:56.480]  in this and in this conscious movement towards authoritarianism well there's
[39:56.480 --> 40:02.280]  no doubt about it and you're absolutely right about the disruption that that
[40:02.280 --> 40:09.000]  comes to the communities because it is there most major changes occur you know
[40:09.000 --> 40:12.960]  domestically you know we take another office to obey the Constitution and
[40:12.960 --> 40:17.560]  defend it against the enemies that foreign and domestic well you know I
[40:17.560 --> 40:22.280]  usually make that point and even in the very very patriotic crowds and
[40:22.280 --> 40:26.240]  veterans which you think would be more hockey if you emphasize you know the
[40:26.240 --> 40:31.640]  domestic threat they understand this so but I think I think we're actually
[40:31.640 --> 40:35.320]  willing this argument about this need for militarism around the world to
[40:35.320 --> 40:40.560]  protect ourselves and that we have to worry about domestically because people
[40:40.560 --> 40:45.120]  are getting tired of having somebody from the government check every single
[40:45.120 --> 40:50.840]  single thing you know but back again to China you can start businesses easier in
[40:50.840 --> 40:56.680]  China than here so people who have land people who want to start a business
[40:56.680 --> 41:01.800]  that people who have to pay these high taxes and and pay for all these
[41:01.800 --> 41:07.760]  regulations there they're starting to realize this so I I I think there's a
[41:07.760 --> 41:13.360]  healthy resistance developing but like you point out there there is some
[41:13.360 --> 41:17.760]  danger here and that is of course if we get people to understand where the cause
[41:17.760 --> 41:23.000]  comes from that we might be able to prevent this to the one thing the one
[41:23.000 --> 41:27.960]  coalition that we should build we talk a lot about the poop the poor getting
[41:27.960 --> 41:33.080]  poor in the middle class being wiped out but the left always think well the
[41:33.080 --> 41:37.920]  answer to that is just more transfer of wealth but we have to get them to
[41:37.920 --> 41:42.840]  understand that the reason it happened is because government is too big even
[41:42.840 --> 41:47.000]  though they argue for government programs the government is too big they
[41:47.000 --> 41:51.000]  argue for these programs and get who lost their homes the rich got richer and
[41:51.000 --> 41:56.880]  the poor people lost their homes because of this program but the big the big the
[41:56.880 --> 42:02.960]  other big issue is to make sure that people know that you know corporatism
[42:02.960 --> 42:07.880]  is not free market economics and that's misunderstanding that was my mom but my
[42:07.880 --> 42:11.400]  other point and I'm glad you got into that because we're of the same mind
[42:11.400 --> 42:14.680]  because we studied history but but quantify that for for listeners who may
[42:14.680 --> 42:20.440]  be new the ultra robber baron non-free market crony capitalist always is
[42:20.440 --> 42:25.000]  carol quickly said at georgetown but clinton's mentor lobby for authoritarianism
[42:25.000 --> 42:29.560]  whether it's right-wing left-wing fascist socialist communists because they
[42:29.560 --> 42:34.280]  create this big pool of collectivized wealth and they take it offshore and now
[42:34.280 --> 42:38.280]  the ultra rich are trying to sell the poor people who are losing their jobs on
[42:38.280 --> 42:43.920]  higher taxes and looting their neighbor who's got more money than them selling
[42:43.920 --> 42:47.920]  them the lie that that's going to give them a good economy when it's freedom
[42:47.920 --> 42:52.120]  that's going to give them a future yeah and then they lump everybody together if
[42:52.120 --> 42:56.480]  you are a businessman and there are a lot of very decent wealthy businessmen in
[42:56.480 --> 43:00.000]  this country that earned it and didn't have to live off the government but they
[43:00.000 --> 43:05.760]  get lumped into that so when there's unrest the the everybody's lumped
[43:05.760 --> 43:09.320]  together whether they're the they're the people who lived off the government
[43:09.320 --> 43:13.200]  lives off the taxpayer or whether they were successful because they delivered
[43:13.200 --> 43:18.080]  good products to consumers at good prices so there's a big difference there
[43:18.080 --> 43:22.120]  and you know I've had some discussion with Ralph Nader and I'm I imagine
[43:22.120 --> 43:25.440]  there are a few of your listeners that can't stand Ralph Nader but I like to
[43:25.440 --> 43:29.240]  talk to him because we do come up with some agreements on this I mean he hates
[43:29.240 --> 43:33.960]  his corporatism and it doesn't like the war and things so I work with people who
[43:33.960 --> 43:39.600]  can agree with me on some of this so this is what we have to do is is make
[43:39.600 --> 43:43.800]  sure our definitions are clear then we have a better chance it's all in these
[43:43.800 --> 43:49.160]  problems very well said congressman we're seeing riots all over the world
[43:49.160 --> 43:52.560]  over global inflation driven by the devaluation of the dollar and other
[43:52.560 --> 43:57.520]  fiat currencies you've you've been mentioning unrest here and clearly we're
[43:57.520 --> 44:03.000]  seeing more and more signs of that here and I remember you back in in Austin
[44:03.000 --> 44:07.200]  giving a speech that I attended seven years ago we were talking about it
[44:07.200 --> 44:10.880]  during the break when you first got on and you warned that when the empire
[44:10.880 --> 44:15.360]  starts collapsing there's two ways to go it's either recognize that big
[44:15.360 --> 44:19.320]  government breeds corruption and go the opposite direction towards liberty but
[44:19.320 --> 44:22.760]  that more often than not instead the government's going to sell even more of
[44:22.760 --> 44:28.280]  the same as the solution and so now is the time to to to to get this out to
[44:28.280 --> 44:32.840]  people I mean this is a life-and-death situation for our republic is it not
[44:32.840 --> 44:37.560]  yes and it's hard teaching people some of these lessons in the midst of a
[44:37.560 --> 44:42.320]  crisis because then and you can understand the emotions you know when
[44:42.320 --> 44:48.200]  law and order breaks down most people say well just quit the killing calm down
[44:48.200 --> 44:51.920]  things you better bring more police in and that's you know a pretty natural
[44:51.920 --> 44:57.440]  response but not realizing that we have had too many policemen already and too
[44:57.440 --> 45:01.880]  many bureaucrats and too much federal government too much taxes and all that
[45:01.880 --> 45:07.160]  so it to me the earlier the education occurs the better I think people have
[45:07.160 --> 45:12.400]  to know and understand why it's in their best interest at that that the free
[45:12.400 --> 45:16.240]  market works better people think that you have to sacrifice and all this I
[45:16.240 --> 45:19.920]  don't think you have to sacrifice a thing freedom freedom if you get your
[45:19.920 --> 45:24.480]  freedom you don't have to sacrifice anything because you you have your
[45:24.480 --> 45:27.600]  incentives you can take care of yourself a lot better than the government and
[45:27.600 --> 45:31.600]  and that's the system that has worked and unfortunately we're about to give it
[45:31.600 --> 45:35.880]  up and that's why I fear the day when law and order breaks down but don't
[45:35.880 --> 45:40.320]  question whether there'll be riots in our streets like there've been overseas
[45:40.320 --> 45:45.360]  already and I suspect that the American people are like other people and even in
[45:45.360 --> 45:52.200]  the 60s we had our riots and our shares of problems here so people will act in a
[45:52.200 --> 45:58.440]  violent manner and that's that's up for grabs and you know all factions and
[45:58.440 --> 46:03.640]  we'll be looking to get the powers and the strings of government so we have a
[46:03.640 --> 46:09.960]  big job ahead of us so we're going into some very stormy waters no doubt it's
[46:09.960 --> 46:14.960]  coming it's congressman no doubt you've probably heard about it or seen it but
[46:14.960 --> 46:22.320]  CNN MSNBC democracy now they all singled you and I out specifically and played
[46:22.320 --> 46:27.360]  clips of you speaking in your Texas straight talk and clips of my radio
[46:27.360 --> 46:32.840]  TV show where we talked about the Second Amendment being there and it's in the
[46:32.840 --> 46:37.840]  Declaration of Independence it's in the Bill of Rights to defend against crime
[46:37.840 --> 46:43.240]  on the streets but also against a tyrannical government and they have
[46:43.240 --> 46:50.800]  tried to now demonize and imply that you and I and others are the progenitors in
[46:50.800 --> 46:55.680]  an asinine way of what happened in Tucson which we now know was a
[46:55.680 --> 46:59.320]  schizophrenic who was politically a liberal I'm not blaming the Democrats
[46:59.320 --> 47:04.160]  but what do you think about the desperation we saw Rachel Maddow and
[47:04.160 --> 47:09.760]  others go after your son and tell a laundry list of Dr. Rand Paul and of
[47:09.760 --> 47:12.560]  course that backfired on them we seem to boost his approval rating when Clinton
[47:12.560 --> 47:15.480]  went and campaigned against him now we see them doing it against you and I
[47:15.480 --> 47:19.160]  because they see us as a threat because we're getting the truth out what is your
[47:19.160 --> 47:25.000]  view on a the the the the the ratcheting up of their rhetoric congressman Steve
[47:25.000 --> 47:30.200]  Cohen calling Republicans Nazis a few days ago and the fact that it's backfiring
[47:30.200 --> 47:36.160]  in every case from the polls we're seeing well there's a limit and that says
[47:36.160 --> 47:41.240]  something for the American people maybe they won't buy into that but they they're
[47:41.240 --> 47:46.000]  certainly going to make any effort and this is a frustration for me because I
[47:46.000 --> 47:51.880]  do make a diligent effort to try to work with honest straightforward people who
[47:51.880 --> 47:55.840]  may be called to progressives and liberals because some of them are decent
[47:55.840 --> 48:00.040]  and they're honest but they're not these demagogues and those people who turn on
[48:00.040 --> 48:05.360]  you their their goal is more like the promotion of the Democrat Party or
[48:05.360 --> 48:12.640]  come promoting of liberal of government power so there they might say they agree
[48:12.640 --> 48:16.720]  with us on a couple issues but they I sort them out and some of them the ones
[48:16.720 --> 48:20.400]  that you're talking about are just the demagogues who may one say one thing and
[48:20.400 --> 48:25.360]  say oh yeah we don't like this we don't like that but then then they'll they'll
[48:25.360 --> 48:30.000]  turn on you and they'll do anything to maintain their power or to discredit us
[48:30.000 --> 48:35.000]  for what we're doing well and it's also hypocritical they're demonizing the
[48:35.000 --> 48:38.800]  First Amendment talking about fairness doctrine for talk radio FCC
[48:38.800 --> 48:43.960]  jurisdiction over the internet this is all being announced while Matthews is
[48:43.960 --> 48:52.080]  calling white people crackers Maddow is implying that we're causing violence the
[48:52.080 --> 48:58.560]  congressman's calling Republicans Nazis I mean it's it's it's just incredible how
[48:58.560 --> 49:01.720]  they're trying to balkanize and turn the American people against each other
[49:01.720 --> 49:05.440]  when you look at the polls liberals conservatives libertarians almost
[49:05.440 --> 49:10.160]  everybody's against the banker bailouts the wars I mean the momentum if
[49:10.160 --> 49:15.800]  he's shifting towards freedom no doubt about that but there's still a lot of
[49:15.800 --> 49:20.040]  people and I think that you can say at the grassroots level that is the case
[49:20.040 --> 49:23.040]  our problem has been you know it's taking a long time to build the
[49:23.040 --> 49:27.200]  bureaucracy and when you think of these millions of people who are living off the
[49:27.200 --> 49:30.640]  government and work for the government they work in Washington they're
[49:30.640 --> 49:35.840]  embedded into the political system and and so many in Congress they have all
[49:35.840 --> 49:40.440]  clung to these these these views that they've held before but the American
[49:40.440 --> 49:46.440]  people you know are further ahead I think the people are always ahead of the
[49:46.440 --> 49:52.680]  politicians and hopefully we'll win out on this fight but unfortunately the
[49:52.680 --> 49:56.120]  opposition has a lot of guns it's interesting how they want to take our
[49:56.120 --> 50:01.120]  guns away but everything the government does it depends on a gun it's all
[50:01.120 --> 50:06.400]  about their guns against against the guns of the civilians but but you know
[50:06.400 --> 50:09.720]  whether it's tax collection or telling you whether you can dig a ditch on your
[50:09.720 --> 50:16.840]  land and how you can use your land you may you know be you are costed by a
[50:16.840 --> 50:20.800]  federal agent with with the gun everything they do has to be you know
[50:20.800 --> 50:27.720]  enforced with it with a gun and it's a threat they never talk about that kind
[50:27.720 --> 50:32.200]  of gun violence how often have they been barging into houses into the wrong
[50:32.200 --> 50:37.520]  houses with guns blaring and blowing up the places and looking for drugs that
[50:37.520 --> 50:42.880]  didn't exist and not even apologize and never compensate these people and
[50:42.880 --> 50:47.760]  sometimes hurt and kill some of these people innocent people and that's the
[50:47.760 --> 50:52.680]  kind of gun violence that ought to be you know rejected absolutely Mao say
[50:52.680 --> 50:55.520]  tongue said political power goes out of the barrel of a gun well we're the
[50:55.520 --> 50:58.680]  people and that's our check and balance congressman in the eight minutes we've
[50:58.680 --> 51:03.000]  got left with you we have a prison planet dot com info wars dot com
[51:03.000 --> 51:07.200]  headline congressman senator or president as you know a lot of big
[51:07.200 --> 51:13.720]  scientific polls the Hill newspaper the Democratic affiliate public policy
[51:13.720 --> 51:17.080]  polling and others are finding that you're in the number one or number two
[51:17.080 --> 51:24.880]  seat to win the Texas Senate race for us Senate if you so choose and at the
[51:24.880 --> 51:29.680]  same time you've won the CPAC coveted Republican straw poll while giving an
[51:29.680 --> 51:35.160]  anti-war anti-empire speech I have to just give you my opinion I believe as
[51:35.160 --> 51:38.600]  running for president you don't have as good a shot as winning though you do
[51:38.600 --> 51:41.640]  have I think a pretty good shot but you'll have a much more powerful
[51:41.640 --> 51:46.440]  educational platform I'd say ten times bigger than 2008 going into the
[51:46.440 --> 51:50.800]  critical crisis but if you go for a Senate you probably got a better chance
[51:50.800 --> 51:56.360]  of winning congressman and of course then you'd have even more power with a
[51:56.360 --> 52:01.960]  filibuster in the Senate congressman Ron Paul that's you know the question a
[52:01.960 --> 52:05.920]  what are you looking at there and be you said the people if they're behind you
[52:05.920 --> 52:09.840]  and if things continue to deteriorate right this you know that folks will
[52:09.840 --> 52:12.760]  listen to you more that you may run I believe you're gonna run because you
[52:12.760 --> 52:15.960]  know it's the right thing to do and we win just by you running being able to
[52:15.960 --> 52:19.760]  educate people where do you stand on this when people are chomping at the bit
[52:19.760 --> 52:24.680]  to know and I saw your quotes in the news saying that you are interested in
[52:24.680 --> 52:31.600]  the Senate polls you've been saying well unfortunately I'm still very ambivalent
[52:31.600 --> 52:36.000]  about all this I usually am not ambivalent on my views and what I do and
[52:36.000 --> 52:42.160]  what my plans are but it does require a major decision a personal decision a
[52:42.160 --> 52:48.320]  family decision a political decision all these things so I am I'm pretty
[52:48.320 --> 52:52.560]  undecided on what to do and I think it through people keep asking me do you
[52:52.560 --> 52:56.800]  think about doing this and I admit it I do I think about it all the time not
[52:56.800 --> 53:01.000]  only because I wonder what I'm going to do the rest of my life but I often think
[53:01.000 --> 53:05.600]  about it because when I get on radio talk shows they ask me these kind of
[53:05.600 --> 53:11.240]  questions but I'm still pretty undecided on what I should do and what I can do
[53:11.240 --> 53:15.800]  and what I'll end up doing well I challenged your doctor and now
[53:15.800 --> 53:20.960]  senator son when he was really just exploring it more than you know I guess
[53:20.960 --> 53:24.920]  a year and a half two years ago and I said look Rand you're gonna win just by
[53:24.920 --> 53:28.760]  injecting real ideas and I said I believe you will win and because I mean
[53:28.760 --> 53:32.760]  I'm no political rocket scientist but I could look at the field in Kentucky I
[53:32.760 --> 53:37.560]  could see the Tea Party movement that that that your supporters started four
[53:37.560 --> 53:41.720]  years ago three and a half years ago and look he's there he's won he went
[53:41.720 --> 53:44.600]  through hell but he's there and he did the right thing for his country and free
[53:44.600 --> 53:49.360]  humanity you and just as I asked you on air and off air before you ran for
[53:49.360 --> 53:52.760]  president very early on I know many others did said congressman I know it's
[53:52.760 --> 53:56.600]  rough on your family the attacks the physical danger but I said you've got
[53:56.600 --> 54:01.640]  to do it and you're a man of conscience you know a man who has a big heart and
[54:01.640 --> 54:06.120]  who I know from your actions and your fruits but also my discernment is the
[54:06.120 --> 54:13.160]  real deal I don't think you have any choice but to run for president and or
[54:13.160 --> 54:17.240]  bare minimum Senate and it is your destiny Congress from Ron Paul and you're
[54:17.240 --> 54:21.760]  almost 40 years of standing up for liberty and so I'm drafting you right
[54:21.760 --> 54:25.000]  here and I know my listeners are and you know the end of your health holds up
[54:25.000 --> 54:30.040]  you've taken care of yourself you're barring that I just hope and pray sir
[54:30.040 --> 54:34.000]  that you do run for president I think the sooner you announce the better so we
[54:34.000 --> 54:37.440]  can get the money and the energy and the grassroots behind you and I want you to
[54:37.440 --> 54:43.680]  know you've got my full support of our millions of listeners well I I appreciate
[54:43.680 --> 54:49.760]  the comments it's just a it's just real real difficult the one thing I can
[54:49.760 --> 54:54.440]  assure you and all your listeners is that it would be pretty hard for me to
[54:54.440 --> 55:03.560]  pack my bag and go and retire and live quietly thereafter here after and not
[55:03.560 --> 55:07.880]  be involved but no regardless I've been in and out of office I've run for
[55:07.880 --> 55:12.560]  offices I've won some lose some and all that one thing is it would be very hard
[55:12.560 --> 55:17.800]  for me to exist without working diligently to promote our cause and
[55:17.800 --> 55:22.000]  which is the cause of personal liberty and and the things that I believe in
[55:22.000 --> 55:27.040]  because I believe this is how people have an opportunity to improve themselves
[55:27.040 --> 55:32.840]  and live freely and creatively so I'm convinced of all that so well it's in
[55:32.840 --> 55:37.720]  political officer whatever I will be working as hard as I can to promote that
[55:37.720 --> 55:41.320]  cause well we know that and I mean even if you just did the debates and didn't
[55:41.320 --> 55:45.040]  beat yourself to death flying everywhere even if you did it electronically
[55:45.040 --> 55:48.080]  which I think is the most effective I think a lot of campaigning is outdated
[55:48.080 --> 55:53.160]  with the focus on the individual you're getting out there in person I mean even
[55:53.160 --> 55:56.600]  if you did it electronically and you know I mean you've got to run obviously
[55:56.600 --> 56:00.840]  because the educational points but obviously we respect your decision and
[56:00.840 --> 56:04.040]  we'll and we'll appreciate you and support you regardless but you can see
[56:04.040 --> 56:09.180]  as Julia Caesar said there is a tide in the affairs of men when taken at the
[56:09.180 --> 56:12.600]  flood leads on to fortune and the fortune we seek is the jewel of liberty
[56:12.600 --> 56:16.520]  as Thomas Jefferson said and that jewel must be guarded jealously and you are
[56:16.520 --> 56:19.880]  the great guardian of that jewel of anyone in the world you are that light
[56:19.880 --> 56:24.680]  standing out like no other and I don't think that you're going to not run in
[56:24.680 --> 56:28.400]  my gut I know you are and Congressman we just really from the bottom of my
[56:28.400 --> 56:31.720]  hearts want to thank you for the great work you're doing we've only got about
[56:31.720 --> 56:35.720]  two or three minutes left in closing taking sites on auditing and then
[56:35.720 --> 56:41.840]  reforming abolishing the Fed where do you stand with your periscope sites on
[56:41.840 --> 56:48.280]  that great warmock well I'm looking forward to that and I tried to get a
[56:48.280 --> 56:54.000]  hearing in January but Congress is still disorganized because it's newly
[56:54.000 --> 57:00.120]  created so in February the hearings are going to start I did find out also that
[57:00.120 --> 57:06.800]  the rules prevent me from insisting that Bernanke come before a a you know a
[57:06.800 --> 57:11.280]  subcommittee and they he only comes before full committee that's just where
[57:11.280 --> 57:15.400]  the rules are like a secretary of Treasury too but it doesn't keep me from
[57:15.400 --> 57:19.760]  pursuing all the views that we have to have exposing the Fed transparency of
[57:19.760 --> 57:23.760]  the Fed teaching people why the Fed is responsible for the booms and the bus
[57:23.760 --> 57:28.600]  the unemployment and the inflation I mean it is a hot topic it's going to get
[57:28.600 --> 57:34.480]  hotter and we're going to have our side well represented and the hearings are
[57:34.480 --> 57:37.880]  not going to be huge sometimes they have six and eight people come for hearings
[57:37.880 --> 57:43.800]  ours will be smaller and they're going to be very deliberative and there's going
[57:43.800 --> 57:48.080]  to be debate going on I believe we're going to get a lot of attention I think
[57:48.080 --> 57:52.960]  we can achieve a whole lot by by this is and especially as we move into this
[57:52.960 --> 57:57.920]  crisis because then once we expose the Fed then we better start talking about a
[57:57.920 --> 58:04.040]  transition and how we get out of this and already you know the the opposition
[58:04.040 --> 58:07.080]  those at the World Bank talked about yeah we might have to have a new currency
[58:07.080 --> 58:10.400]  maybe we ought to use a little bit of gold so they want to neutralize us a
[58:10.400 --> 58:14.080]  little bit but they want to control everything but this is going to be our
[58:14.080 --> 58:18.760]  challenge we're going to place this this replace sure that's something
[58:18.760 --> 58:21.400]  I'll be working very hard on well Congressman as you know we're here at
[58:21.400 --> 58:24.240]  the crisis they're going to try to use it to get even more power we've got to
[58:24.240 --> 58:27.160]  deal with it now and there you are historically at the perfect time in
[58:27.160 --> 58:31.080]  perfect place have a great weekend coming up Congressman Ron Paul and we'll
[58:31.080 --> 58:34.200]  talk to you again soon thank you for joining us thank you talk to you but
[58:34.200 --> 58:37.400]  to talk to you we'll be right back ladies and gentlemen with Paul Joseph Watson

[59:00.240 --> 59:04.440]  off this agenda that we're pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home
[59:04.440 --> 59:09.600]  I've turned members influence on our president in Congress and they really
[59:09.600 --> 59:14.400]  are calling the shots I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American
[59:14.400 --> 59:18.760]  citizens to pay attention for the Republic identifies the enemies of our
[59:18.760 --> 59:24.040]  nation the criminal offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty and on
[59:24.040 --> 59:28.320]  its ashes constructing world government Tim Geithner Bernanke their arsonists
[59:28.320 --> 59:31.840]  they're asking for more matches and the Congress is saying who do we make the
[59:31.840 --> 59:37.080]  checkout to today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we

[01:00:05.240 --> 01:00:12.960]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does
[01:00:12.960 --> 01:00:20.480]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin, Texas
[01:00:20.480 --> 01:00:24.040]  Alex Jones
[01:00:24.440 --> 01:00:30.160]  it's speed day on the Alex Jones show here's the second hour with me your
[01:00:30.160 --> 01:00:35.440]  host Paul Joseph Watson and of course Joel Scowson will be hosting in a third
[01:00:35.440 --> 01:00:43.120]  hour so be sure to stay tuned for that now today sees the launch of our new
[01:00:43.120 --> 01:00:50.440]  campaign you are the resistance resistance is victory and of course we're
[01:00:50.440 --> 01:00:57.120]  going with the classic historical archetype the symbol of resistance as
[01:00:57.120 --> 01:01:05.920]  part of this video and flyer campaign that Alex is launching today now homeland
[01:01:05.920 --> 01:01:11.760]  security has announced its total takeover of society with the video
[01:01:11.760 --> 01:01:17.640]  messages at Walmart checkouts ordering Americans to report on each other and
[01:01:17.640 --> 01:01:21.840]  now we know that these are being expanded to sports stadiums shopping malls
[01:01:21.840 --> 01:01:28.800]  and other places within your community across the nation now yesterday we
[01:01:28.800 --> 01:01:34.040]  posted also the billboard homeland securities now ordering Americans where
[01:01:34.040 --> 01:01:40.520]  they can and can park their vehicle so we've officially launched our V for
[01:01:40.520 --> 01:01:47.000]  victory campaign to let big sis know that we're not going to tolerate the DHS
[01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:57.440]  invasion of America now the historical foundation of this V symbol campaign of
[01:01:57.440 --> 01:02:02.880]  which you can download the flyers on prisonplanet.com right now has nothing
[01:02:02.880 --> 01:02:09.480]  to do with V for vendetta the movie it's launched within the spirit of the
[01:02:09.480 --> 01:02:16.040]  French resistance who expressed their solidarity and defiance when France was
[01:02:16.040 --> 01:02:22.960]  invaded and occupied by the Nazis during World War two now Alex touched on this
[01:02:22.960 --> 01:02:29.440]  a little bit earlier the confluence of events that created this campaign came
[01:02:29.440 --> 01:02:37.000]  as Alex was already preparing to launch the answer to 1984 is 1776 campaign
[01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:43.000]  details of which are going up imminently on info wars.com and then I
[01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:49.880]  had the idea to incorporate the V resistance symbol within that campaign
[01:02:49.880 --> 01:02:55.680]  Alex was already preparing to launch because the historical archetype of the
[01:02:55.680 --> 01:03:02.560]  French resistance as a whole is a powerful undercurrent of the message of
[01:03:02.560 --> 01:03:08.920]  freedom that continues to vibrate through the generations now my personal
[01:03:08.920 --> 01:03:13.600]  interest was really peaked when my parents recently moved into their new
[01:03:13.600 --> 01:03:19.640]  house in France which was built in the 1860s and we subsequently found out that
[01:03:19.640 --> 01:03:25.560]  it was inhabited by French resistance rebels who were active in the ether
[01:03:25.560 --> 01:03:32.200]  region of France during the Second World War which was a particularly rich
[01:03:32.200 --> 01:03:38.040]  region for resistance against the Nazis in the latter stages of the Second World
[01:03:38.040 --> 01:03:43.600]  War but on top of that when I visited my parents at Christmas we went for a walk
[01:03:43.600 --> 01:03:49.320]  in the forest behind their house and we stumbled upon this huge derelict
[01:03:49.320 --> 01:03:54.600]  chateau in the middle of the woods which we later discovered was in fact
[01:03:54.600 --> 01:04:00.360]  another headquarters for the French resistance leadership in the area and
[01:04:00.360 --> 01:04:04.040]  it was basically situated not much more than a stone's throw from where my
[01:04:04.040 --> 01:04:08.800]  parents live and having lived there for many months now they they didn't what
[01:04:08.800 --> 01:04:12.760]  weren't even aware of it until we just stumbled across it and it turns out that
[01:04:12.760 --> 01:04:17.120]  this the reason behind this chateau being derelict is because the French
[01:04:17.120 --> 01:04:23.640]  resistance leaders who were headquartered inside it were burned alive when the
[01:04:23.640 --> 01:04:31.960]  Nazis touched the house in 1944 so to have you know such a visceral piece of
[01:04:31.960 --> 01:04:36.880]  history in the woods behind my parents house obviously encouraged me to begin a
[01:04:36.880 --> 01:04:42.280]  deeper study of the French resistance which is eventually what led to the idea
[01:04:42.280 --> 01:04:47.320]  for this v for victory campaign so we'll get into this more after the break this
[01:04:47.320 --> 01:04:50.920]  is the Alex Jones show Wayne Madsen coming up at the bottom of the hour

[01:06:21.360 --> 01:06:25.440]  three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and
[01:06:25.440 --> 01:06:30.000]  now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four
[01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:34.120]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of
[01:06:34.120 --> 01:06:38.080]  families lose their power from weather related onages number five a solar power

[01:08:06.960 --> 01:08:16.120]  information war continues it's alex jones and the GCN radio network welcome
[01:08:16.120 --> 01:08:22.880]  back to V-Day on the alex jones show on this 21st of January 2011 we've
[01:08:22.880 --> 01:08:28.320]  officially launched the V for victory resistance campaign today at prison
[01:08:28.320 --> 01:08:35.360]  planet.com and info wars.com and we're encouraging info warriors worldwide not
[01:08:35.360 --> 01:08:41.120]  just in America to join us in posting these flyers everywhere as a powerful
[01:08:41.120 --> 01:08:46.320]  symbol of our defiance against the takeover of society by the new world
[01:08:46.320 --> 01:08:52.680]  order and why is it necessary to invoke the spirit of the French resistance to
[01:08:52.680 --> 01:09:00.480]  make a point about 21st century America because not just in America or the United
[01:09:00.480 --> 01:09:07.160]  Kingdom but the West as a whole is on this same slippery slide towards the
[01:09:07.160 --> 01:09:13.440]  very same informant spy starsy societies that were set up by the Nazis and
[01:09:13.440 --> 01:09:18.560]  the Soviets both in Russia and the former East Germany homeland security
[01:09:18.560 --> 01:09:22.520]  you're telling Americans to spy on each other to create an environment of fear
[01:09:22.520 --> 01:09:29.560]  so that they can then exploit it for total control and why is that important
[01:09:29.560 --> 01:09:34.640]  in the context of history well show me a case in history where the government
[01:09:34.640 --> 01:09:41.320]  recruiting citizens to spy on each other led to a more secure happy free and
[01:09:41.320 --> 01:09:47.200]  prosperous society show me one example and I'll show you a chicken with teeth
[01:09:47.200 --> 01:09:53.280]  you know best case scenario what's now happening in America leads to political
[01:09:53.280 --> 01:09:58.360]  oppression and dissidents being jailed as it did in East Germany worst case
[01:09:58.360 --> 01:10:05.520]  scenario leads to death camps as in Nazi Germany many of the French resistance
[01:10:05.520 --> 01:10:10.200]  fighters in Paris and France as a whole were shipped off to those very same
[01:10:10.200 --> 01:10:14.480]  death camps for expressing their resistance against occupation and now
[01:10:14.480 --> 01:10:20.520]  we invoke their spirit their symbol of the V for victory in our resistance
[01:10:20.520 --> 01:10:25.800]  campaign against the takeover of our society which is in many ways more
[01:10:25.800 --> 01:10:32.280]  insidious than black boot wearing stormtrooping Nazis at least the French
[01:10:32.280 --> 01:10:37.120]  could see who their oppressors were whereas in modern-day America the
[01:10:37.120 --> 01:10:41.640]  government simply indoctrinates the American citizens to become each others
[01:10:41.640 --> 01:10:45.920]  oppressors we had the article a few weeks ago of the father who fed his
[01:10:45.920 --> 01:10:51.320]  daughter with organic food prevented his children from having vaccines his
[01:10:51.320 --> 01:10:56.240]  neighbors reported him as a potential terrorist see something say something
[01:10:56.240 --> 01:11:02.960]  this is where it's all heading now I've written again getting back to the
[01:11:02.960 --> 01:11:07.600]  historical foundation of this where it's all coming from I've written many
[01:11:07.600 --> 01:11:14.200]  times about the study of Robert Glatley from Florida University and he found
[01:11:14.200 --> 01:11:19.720]  that the common misconception about Nazi Germany and how it built up as this
[01:11:19.720 --> 01:11:26.000]  totalitarian state from the 30s onwards a common misconception was that the
[01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:31.520]  Gestapo investigations would came from the top when in fact he found that 80
[01:11:31.520 --> 01:11:36.120]  percent of Gestapo investigations of so-called political dissidents in
[01:11:36.120 --> 01:11:41.760]  Nazi Germany came from what they called denunciations by ordinary German
[01:11:41.760 --> 01:11:49.360]  citizens so 80% of the cases were from informants there were relatively few
[01:11:49.360 --> 01:11:53.560]  secret police wrote Glatley and most were just processing the information
[01:11:53.560 --> 01:11:58.240]  coming in I had found a shocking fact it wasn't the secret police who were
[01:11:58.240 --> 01:12:03.040]  doing this wide-scale surveillance and hiding on every street corner it was
[01:12:03.040 --> 01:12:07.840]  the ordinary German people who were informing on their neighbors and now
[01:12:07.840 --> 01:12:13.280]  what is Homeland Security telling Americans to do at Walmart checkout
[01:12:13.280 --> 01:12:18.280]  counters report suspicious activity in a program that's now been expanded to
[01:12:18.280 --> 01:12:23.520]  nine thousand shopping malls sports stadiums different buildings around the
[01:12:23.520 --> 01:12:29.200]  country and what else did Glatley find in his study of informant societies in
[01:12:29.200 --> 01:12:34.480]  Nazi Germany he found that people were motivated to inform on their neighbors
[01:12:34.480 --> 01:12:38.720]  friends and colleagues not through any genuine concern for security which is
[01:12:38.720 --> 01:12:43.600]  how Homeland Security pitches it but through banal factor like quote greed
[01:12:43.600 --> 01:12:49.840]  jealousy and petty differences quote history tells us that any stars you like
[01:12:49.840 --> 01:12:54.280]  society does nothing to increase genuine security and only turns the host
[01:12:54.280 --> 01:13:00.120]  population against each other while decaying the country from within and you
[01:13:00.120 --> 01:13:05.120]  can read about that study in the article we posted today announcing the launch
[01:13:05.120 --> 01:13:15.640]  of the V for victory contest so also in Nazi Germany we had cases where people
[01:13:15.640 --> 01:13:19.040]  will be financially rewarded for informing on their neighbors and we've
[01:13:19.040 --> 01:13:23.280]  wrote several articles over the past few years where in fact now local
[01:13:23.280 --> 01:13:27.920]  authorities in America are doing precisely that giving people cash bonuses
[01:13:27.920 --> 01:13:32.000]  for turning in their friends and neighbors and Homeland Security is
[01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:35.040]  embarked on the very same thing with their announcement that they're now
[01:13:35.040 --> 01:13:39.960]  looking for the general public to give them PSAs that promote this very
[01:13:39.960 --> 01:13:45.040]  starzy spy program so they're openly handing out cash bonuses for the
[01:13:45.040 --> 01:13:53.720]  American public to promote their fear mongering agenda so the interesting
[01:13:53.720 --> 01:13:57.960]  thing to this whole campaign is of course what it's based on generating
[01:13:57.960 --> 01:14:05.160]  which is a reaction you know will the neo-lib statist Obama Borg hive blogs
[01:14:05.160 --> 01:14:12.520]  and their allies in the establishment media demonize this as they did the
[01:14:12.520 --> 01:14:18.160]  Obama Joker campaign as racist you know they tried to say it was vandalism they
[01:14:18.160 --> 01:14:25.280]  labeled it the LA Times did as an act of cultural terrorism when you know getting
[01:14:25.280 --> 01:14:31.280]  it down to breath tax it was a mere poster campaign and compare it to
[01:14:31.280 --> 01:14:37.600]  shepherd fairies pro-Obama poster campaign which elicited no condemnation
[01:14:37.600 --> 01:14:44.440]  from the establishment whatsoever it shows you how petrified the establishment
[01:14:44.440 --> 01:14:50.840]  is of a mere poster campaign of merely the slaves standing up and saying that
[01:14:50.840 --> 01:14:56.760]  they are the resistance and they will not tolerate this endless fealty as a
[01:14:56.760 --> 01:15:03.200]  march of big government accelerates but this is bigger than Obama it's about
[01:15:03.200 --> 01:15:08.320]  sending a symbolic message of defiance to those who believe that they have the
[01:15:08.320 --> 01:15:14.200]  divine right to micromanage every facet of our lives while turning Americans
[01:15:14.200 --> 01:15:19.440]  against each other you know now they're trying to ban the incandescent lightbulb
[01:15:19.440 --> 01:15:23.220]  I mean for God's sake if they can ban a lightbulb if they can ban you from
[01:15:23.220 --> 01:15:27.600]  purchasing a lightbulb they can basically order you to do anything and
[01:15:27.600 --> 01:15:34.800]  it's not just about homeland security either this march of authoritarianism is
[01:15:34.800 --> 01:15:39.120]  global in its reach as you well know so whether you're in the United Kingdom
[01:15:39.120 --> 01:15:43.720]  America Europe or wherever you can get involved in this campaign and the
[01:15:43.720 --> 01:15:48.880]  message is universal that you are the resistance which is what's printed on
[01:15:48.880 --> 01:15:55.120]  the flyers and it's about you know getting beyond the powerlessness the
[01:15:55.120 --> 01:16:02.400]  inferiority complex the pessimism the occupied French the French resistance
[01:16:02.400 --> 01:16:07.000]  knew that they were living in tyranny and the vast majority of them became
[01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:12.360]  frustrated at this same feeling of hopelessness and powerlessness that
[01:16:12.360 --> 01:16:17.360]  many of the listeners and the readers of our websites feel today but as we
[01:16:17.360 --> 01:16:23.880]  quoted from Matthew Cobb's book about the French resistance which I'm reading at
[01:16:23.880 --> 01:16:33.920]  the moment quote the V campaign meant ordinary people could feel they were
[01:16:33.920 --> 01:16:41.360]  doing something however symbolic to protest against the occupation and
[01:16:41.360 --> 01:16:45.920]  that's why the the French in Paris and other occupied areas spent their time
[01:16:45.920 --> 01:16:51.600]  scrolling spray painting posting up this V symbol which was later used in
[01:16:51.600 --> 01:16:58.320]  several movies television series right up until the past couple of years as
[01:16:58.320 --> 01:17:05.960]  this universal historic symbol of resistance so instead of you know sitting
[01:17:05.960 --> 01:17:10.560]  in front of your computer screams leaving negative pointless comments about
[01:17:10.560 --> 01:17:15.040]  how we're all doomed about how we can't do anything and you know wallowing in
[01:17:15.040 --> 01:17:21.960]  your own lack of self-respect as some still do on a regular basis why not
[01:17:21.960 --> 01:17:29.320]  actually try enjoying in on this V for victory campaign you know why not stop
[01:17:29.320 --> 01:17:34.600]  just for a moment justifying your own apathy and laziness by telling yourself
[01:17:34.600 --> 01:17:39.400]  you know that peaceful action can't achieve change and remember that there
[01:17:39.400 --> 01:17:45.520]  are countless examples throughout history where it has done exactly that now I
[01:17:45.520 --> 01:17:51.000]  only with the French resistance but you know what if Martin Luther King would
[01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:55.120]  just have you know been laying about boning about how you can't change
[01:17:55.120 --> 01:17:59.400]  anything without guns and bombs would black people still be getting hosed by
[01:17:59.400 --> 01:18:06.440]  water cannons and sitting at the back of the bus you know Emily Pankhurst pick
[01:18:06.440 --> 01:18:11.920]  whoever you want did she write letters about the futility of attempting to
[01:18:11.920 --> 01:18:17.600]  change anything or did she stand up and get the job done you know hiding out in
[01:18:17.600 --> 01:18:22.040]  your shack and claiming you're part of some militia when in reality you spend
[01:18:22.040 --> 01:18:27.800]  your time on message boards attacking anyone that bothers to do something just
[01:18:27.800 --> 01:18:36.160]  doesn't quite anymore people try to denigrate the simple action of this
[01:18:36.160 --> 01:18:40.600]  campaign and ones like it like the Obama Joker campaign which was a massive
[01:18:40.600 --> 01:18:47.280]  success which is why the establishment had to demonize it to such a degree the
[01:18:47.280 --> 01:18:52.880]  reason why this is important I mean why do you think Homeland Security feels the
[01:18:52.880 --> 01:18:58.960]  need to put up their posters to put up their tele screens in Walmart and their
[01:18:58.960 --> 01:19:05.200]  messages with Janet Napolitano big sis telling us to live in a constant state
[01:19:05.200 --> 01:19:11.840]  of fear why do they do it if it has no effect why do they do it because it
[01:19:11.840 --> 01:19:17.320]  indoctrinates and coerces obedience from the general public our tactics are no
[01:19:17.320 --> 01:19:22.160]  different from Homeland Security the only difference is that their method of
[01:19:22.160 --> 01:19:29.520]  indoctrination is fear our method of indoctrination is freedom and you know
[01:19:29.520 --> 01:19:35.520]  reasserting ourselves as free-thinking individuals who refuse to be cowed by fear
[01:19:35.520 --> 01:19:40.060]  which is the fear of expressing our right to dissent because we dread the
[01:19:40.060 --> 01:19:45.240]  consequences of the local tattletale reporting us to big sis this is what the
[01:19:45.240 --> 01:19:49.720]  feet campaign is all about we'll be right back stay tuned for more on the

[01:25:32.840 --> 01:25:39.200]  V for victory campaign now what's the what's the reaction going to be you saw
[01:25:39.200 --> 01:25:44.160]  the reaction with the Obama Joker poster campaign which was basically blind
[01:25:44.160 --> 01:25:50.000]  panic which shows you how afraid of the people joining together and simply
[01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:56.520]  asserting their freedom the establishment really is by putting these V
[01:25:56.520 --> 01:26:02.320]  symbols everywhere it becomes a potent display of our power our effectiveness
[01:26:02.320 --> 01:26:07.040]  to influence the collective unconsciousness and literally change minds
[01:26:07.040 --> 01:26:13.040]  and society for the better homeland security does it if it was worthless and
[01:26:13.040 --> 01:26:17.120]  had no effect why are they putting tele screens in Walmart because they're
[01:26:17.120 --> 01:26:22.520]  trying to coerce obedience out of people they're trying to change society for the
[01:26:22.520 --> 01:26:27.800]  worse we're gonna use the exact same tactics put in the spirit of freedom in
[01:26:27.800 --> 01:26:35.800]  the spirit of the French resistance and there's another reason why V for victory
[01:26:35.800 --> 01:26:42.840]  why why our campaign is infinitely more powerful than theirs than see something
[01:26:42.840 --> 01:26:48.600]  say something snitch on your neighbor and it's because because our approach is
[01:26:48.600 --> 01:26:54.040]  based on the solid bedrock of historical resistance to tyranny you know it's
[01:26:54.040 --> 01:26:59.160]  based on everything everything that America is supposed to stand for their
[01:26:59.160 --> 01:27:04.800]  whole approach is based on a contrived fraud that through endless repetition
[01:27:04.800 --> 01:27:10.280]  and mind control they've hoaxed millions of Americans into believing you know
[01:27:10.280 --> 01:27:15.040]  just like reds under the bed or weapons of mass destruction and that is of
[01:27:15.040 --> 01:27:22.760]  course the fear of terrorism now I routinely refer to the report of Ohio
[01:27:22.760 --> 01:27:27.800]  University's John Muller who wrote a white paper called a false sense of
[01:27:27.800 --> 01:27:32.640]  insecurity in which he writes quote for all the attention it evokes terrorism
[01:27:32.640 --> 01:27:36.880]  actually causes rather little damage and the likelihood that any individual will
[01:27:36.880 --> 01:27:43.800]  become a victim in most places is microscopic and I compiled a list
[01:27:43.800 --> 01:27:49.000]  several years ago in this article of some things that are more likely to kill
[01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:55.320]  Americans than terrorists okay here's a here's a little list for you and this is
[01:27:55.320 --> 01:28:00.880]  why the DHS fear campaign is completely ridiculous and debunked on the face of
[01:28:00.880 --> 01:28:07.360]  it peanut allergies every single year kill more Americans than terrorists
[01:28:07.360 --> 01:28:14.640]  accident-causing deer every single year kill more Americans than terrorists of
[01:28:14.640 --> 01:28:19.080]  course the deer could be with al Qaeda that's yet to be confirmed okay
[01:28:19.080 --> 01:28:24.000]  drowning with swimming pools all of these things individually cause more
[01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:28.880]  deaths of Americans per year than any acts of terrorism per year on average
[01:28:28.880 --> 01:28:36.120]  okay lightning strikes kill more people more Americans than terrorists yeah we
[01:28:36.120 --> 01:28:42.680]  don't live in constant fear of accident-causing deer and peanut allergies
[01:28:42.680 --> 01:28:46.160]  and drowning in swimming pools there aren't constant announcements at Walmart
[01:28:46.160 --> 01:28:51.880]  about the al Qaeda deer coming to kill us all yet they always claim more lives
[01:28:51.880 --> 01:28:58.840]  than terrorists and what's even more ludicrous about how the P how the DHS
[01:28:58.840 --> 01:29:04.720]  exploits this fear which is completely contrived and a massive hoax is that in
[01:29:04.720 --> 01:29:10.120]  the most recent PSA about you know terrorist targeting hotels they even
[01:29:10.120 --> 01:29:15.400]  go to the lengths to point out that you know Martha's five bedroom bed and
[01:29:15.400 --> 01:29:21.600]  breakfast out in the middle of nowhere is also a primary target for us Armabin
[01:29:21.600 --> 01:29:27.440]  Laden you know good ol Martha's more likely to get struck by lightning than
[01:29:27.440 --> 01:29:33.160]  she is killed by a terrorist yet they come out with this ridiculous assertion
[01:29:33.160 --> 01:29:37.080]  that people's little B&Bs are gonna get targeted by Bin Laden which is why
[01:29:37.080 --> 01:29:41.160]  Americans need to report on their neighbors so the very foundation of it
[01:29:41.160 --> 01:29:45.760]  is a mass hoax will be back after the break with Wayne Madsen to talk about
[01:29:45.760 --> 01:29:52.080]  Ram Emanuel is the Alex Jones show live stay tuned prisonplanet.tv we're on

[01:33:51.640 --> 01:33:53.920]  hello Wayne welcome to the show today
[01:33:53.920 --> 01:34:00.680]  hi good to be with you now before we talk about Rahm Emanuel which I wanted to
[01:34:00.680 --> 01:34:06.440]  cover I just wanted to get your take on the historical foundation of resistance
[01:34:06.440 --> 01:34:09.760]  movements in general because we've been talking about the launch of our new
[01:34:09.760 --> 01:34:15.400]  campaign today V for victory which is a throwback to how the French resistance
[01:34:15.400 --> 01:34:20.600]  used the symbol of the V sign to express their defiance against being occupied
[01:34:20.600 --> 01:34:26.400]  by the Nazis during World War two and I was reading that your grandmother was
[01:34:26.400 --> 01:34:31.040]  actually a leader in the Danish resistance movement fighting the Nazis at
[01:34:31.040 --> 01:34:37.280]  the same time and now the America is heading the way of all tyrannical
[01:34:37.280 --> 01:34:41.720]  empires with this DHS announcement you know encouraging people to report on
[01:34:41.720 --> 01:34:47.400]  each other I just wanted you to speak to the historical role of collective
[01:34:47.400 --> 01:34:51.720]  resistance movements from your knowledge concerning the involvement of your
[01:34:51.720 --> 01:34:56.840]  grandmother in the resistance against the Nazis all right my grandmother
[01:34:56.840 --> 01:35:04.520]  Victoria Madsen she was a novelist and a journalist in Denmark and after the
[01:35:04.520 --> 01:35:10.560]  Nazis invaded of course she went into the underground the resistance movement
[01:35:10.560 --> 01:35:20.280]  and actively attacked German troops inside the country also was very
[01:35:20.280 --> 01:35:28.280]  instrumental in getting about 7,000 Danish Jews and any any other person
[01:35:28.280 --> 01:35:33.200]  Jewish and otherwise who the Gestapo was after who could make it to Denmark of
[01:35:33.200 --> 01:35:39.760]  course they were they were secreted away on Danish fishing boats and found
[01:35:39.760 --> 01:35:45.040]  refuge in Sweden so so she was involved in a lot of those efforts and of course
[01:35:45.040 --> 01:35:49.680]  after the war she came over to the United States she was very active in the
[01:35:49.680 --> 01:35:56.920]  labor movement and in 1948 she wound up apparently on the FBI's list of a
[01:35:56.920 --> 01:36:01.320]  J. Edgar Hoover took an interest in her and of course you know and this is in
[01:36:01.320 --> 01:36:07.160]  the days of the red scare and she found herself deported back to Canada from
[01:36:07.160 --> 01:36:11.080]  where she entered the United States originally never came back to this
[01:36:11.080 --> 01:36:17.560]  country after that that's fascinating given the context of what we're
[01:36:17.560 --> 01:36:23.520]  discussing today with the launch of this new the for victory campaign moving
[01:36:23.520 --> 01:36:27.360]  on to our main topic of discussion which is Obama's chief of staff of course
[01:36:27.360 --> 01:36:33.120]  Rahm Emanuel now we're limited with time today but yesterday on Prison Planet
[01:36:33.120 --> 01:36:38.760]  we posted the lengthy interview you did Wayne with the reality report on this
[01:36:38.760 --> 01:36:43.720]  subject so I invite people to check out that video in the multimedia section of
[01:36:43.720 --> 01:36:49.320]  Prison Planet for further in-depth conversations on this subject let's
[01:36:49.320 --> 01:36:54.680]  start with the very first thing I learned about Rambo as he's known Rahm
[01:36:54.680 --> 01:37:00.640]  Emanuel which was when he was a point of Obama's chief of staff in November 2008
[01:37:00.640 --> 01:37:08.040]  and this relates to Emanuel's family and his background now Rahm's father
[01:37:08.040 --> 01:37:14.840]  certainly had shall we say a colorful background which is very interesting if
[01:37:14.840 --> 01:37:19.440]  you're a belief that you know the apple doesn't fall very far from the tree so
[01:37:19.440 --> 01:37:25.280]  Wayne tell us about Rahm Emanuel's father and what he was involved with
[01:37:25.280 --> 01:37:30.240]  well we first heard in the media here about his father Benjamin Emanuel when
[01:37:30.240 --> 01:37:36.480]  when after Rahm was appointed chief of staff they asked his father about you
[01:37:36.480 --> 01:37:40.560]  know that the influence his son would have in the Obama White House and he said
[01:37:40.560 --> 01:37:47.600]  well my my son's not going to be an Arab cleaning woman he's chief of
[01:37:47.600 --> 01:37:51.800]  staff of course we didn't really get much in the way of an apology from either
[01:37:51.800 --> 01:37:57.560]  one of the either Benjamin Emanuel or Rahm Emanuel you know it would oh I think
[01:37:57.560 --> 01:38:01.520]  Rahm Emanuel said he regretted that his father's comments but no apology even
[01:38:01.520 --> 01:38:07.040]  though that was a absolutely racist thing for for the father to say and but
[01:38:07.040 --> 01:38:11.880]  this is the gets into what I said on the interview what we have in the Emanuel
[01:38:11.880 --> 01:38:16.080]  family it's certainly not just Benjamin the father now Benjamin the father I
[01:38:16.080 --> 01:38:23.080]  should point out fought in the with the Jewish terrorist organization the
[01:38:23.080 --> 01:38:29.280]  Irgun and and and what was then the British mandate of Palestine and was
[01:38:29.280 --> 01:38:33.680]  very much involved in the blowing up of the King David Hotel in Jerusalem which
[01:38:33.680 --> 01:38:40.200]  killed British British troops and officials Arab Palestinians and Jewish
[01:38:40.200 --> 01:38:45.160]  Palestinians with an indiscriminate terrorist bombing but I was told by
[01:38:45.160 --> 01:38:50.560]  somebody who whose father was a member of the British forces in Palestine at the
[01:38:50.560 --> 01:38:56.560]  time and Benjamin Emanuel was a highly wanted person by the Brits because his
[01:38:56.560 --> 01:39:02.200]  specialty was buses not driving them not preparing them but blowing them up
[01:39:02.200 --> 01:39:07.400]  especially buses packed with British military and police officers and in
[01:39:07.400 --> 01:39:13.160]  Palestine so this is what this is what you you know as as you say that it's not
[01:39:13.160 --> 01:39:17.080]  only that the apple Ron didn't fall too far from the tree but you know he's got
[01:39:17.080 --> 01:39:22.440]  these two brothers one of this super agent Ari Emanuel who apparently is
[01:39:22.440 --> 01:39:27.960]  the real SOP known as an SOP in Hollywood and in his other brother
[01:39:27.960 --> 01:39:31.800]  Ezekiel Emanuel seconded from the National Institutes of Health to help
[01:39:31.800 --> 01:39:37.000]  come up with the the Obama health care program at the White House and of course
[01:39:37.000 --> 01:39:43.120]  you know there's a lot of rhetoric about Obama care but apparently Ezekiel Emanuel
[01:39:43.120 --> 01:39:53.200]  does favor some apparently some form of rationing and you know euthanasia if
[01:39:53.200 --> 01:39:57.880]  that seems to be the only way to go to prevent a lot of money being spent on
[01:39:57.880 --> 01:40:02.320]  somebody who's obviously would be you know terminally ill anyway and you know
[01:40:02.320 --> 01:40:06.680]  prolonging her life would be expensive under under this health care program so
[01:40:06.680 --> 01:40:11.760]  the father Benjamin Emanuel was a pediatrician in Chicago after he came
[01:40:11.760 --> 01:40:17.400]  over here from Israel and in the late 60s there's a report to Chicago Tribune
[01:40:17.400 --> 01:40:23.360]  that one of the women in his care could not find a hospital on a Saturday
[01:40:23.360 --> 01:40:29.240]  apparently Benjamin Emanuel was doing other things on Saturday and and as
[01:40:29.240 --> 01:40:36.280]  the baby was born in a car looking for maternity ward and the baby died because
[01:40:36.280 --> 01:40:43.320]  of a lack of the doctor the attending physician who in this case was Benjamin
[01:40:43.320 --> 01:40:47.800]  Emanuel getting involved to get that woman get that mother to a hospital as
[01:40:47.800 --> 01:40:53.600]  soon as possible I mean it's amazing going back to what you said about his
[01:40:53.600 --> 01:41:00.440]  Ergun terrorist ties I mean this this was the group that isn't it true that
[01:41:00.440 --> 01:41:04.560]  they worked with the infamous Stern gang and that they were also involved in the
[01:41:04.560 --> 01:41:12.200]  dear yes in massacre which was April 1948 which involved house-to-house
[01:41:12.200 --> 01:41:18.880]  slaughtering of Palestinian villagers isn't right it's true that yeah absolutely
[01:41:18.880 --> 01:41:23.640]  absolutely that's that's that's also the case and as I say what I think what you
[01:41:23.640 --> 01:41:27.680]  got with the Emanuel family is it's the it's like the kosher version of the
[01:41:27.680 --> 01:41:33.480]  Sopranos you know I mean these are the and the reason I think we've seen one
[01:41:33.480 --> 01:41:38.920]  after another mayoral candidate drop out of Chicago is probably a lot of strong
[01:41:38.920 --> 01:41:42.960]  arming behind the scenes and now what what do we left with them in the field
[01:41:42.960 --> 01:41:47.120]  we're left with former senator Carol Mosley Braun who really know he's
[01:41:47.120 --> 01:41:51.760]  really think I mean she they they would not want her either really as mayor a
[01:41:51.760 --> 01:41:57.200]  mayor of Chicago a couple of Hispanic American candidates and that's about it
[01:41:57.200 --> 01:42:01.200]  and the people in Chicago say wait a minute but the most of people in the
[01:42:01.200 --> 01:42:05.880]  city despise around Emanuel the only people who seem to support it support
[01:42:05.880 --> 01:42:10.440]  them are living in this in the in the suburbs they can't vote anyway so what
[01:42:10.440 --> 01:42:15.920]  why is he now leading in the polls it's just how he got into the Congress the
[01:42:15.920 --> 01:42:20.400]  same way people in that district which includes Wrigley Field said they didn't
[01:42:20.400 --> 01:42:25.640]  know anything about them many others many Assyrian Christians up there from
[01:42:25.640 --> 01:42:30.040]  Iraq originally who actually thought based on his last name a might be you
[01:42:30.040 --> 01:42:35.200]  know maybe he's an Assyrian Iraqi Christian and they voted for him thinking
[01:42:35.200 --> 01:42:40.000]  he might have been Ken and then turns out he was quite the opposite he served in
[01:42:40.000 --> 01:42:45.040]  the Israel Defense Force during the first Gulf War for example when you know
[01:42:45.040 --> 01:42:51.160]  our American men and women were going to Kuwait and Saudi Arabia and and and
[01:42:51.160 --> 01:42:55.920]  that part of the world to fight against Saddam Hussein Ramamadu also was more
[01:42:55.920 --> 01:43:04.320]  important to go go join the IDF I mean I can't get over the irony Wayne
[01:43:04.320 --> 01:43:10.280]  Madsen of Rahm Emanuel being part of an administration and indeed Emanuel
[01:43:10.280 --> 01:43:15.080]  himself you know pushing to become mayor of Chicago an administration that
[01:43:15.080 --> 01:43:20.160]  tells Americans to inform on each other to stop terrorism when Obama's right
[01:43:20.160 --> 01:43:25.360]  hand man is the son of a terrorist who like to blow up buses and hotels I
[01:43:25.360 --> 01:43:29.480]  can't I really can't get over the richness of that but well I mean I mean
[01:43:29.480 --> 01:43:32.920]  you're right I mean and it's not just look I just don't want to I don't want
[01:43:32.920 --> 01:43:37.120]  to pin this there's so many hypocrites look the new chairman of the House
[01:43:37.120 --> 01:43:41.720]  Homeland Security Committee Peter King from Long Island was a supporter not
[01:43:41.720 --> 01:43:46.800]  of not just of the Irish Republican Army but the provisional wing of the Irish
[01:43:46.800 --> 01:43:50.920]  Republican Army the most violent wing of the Irish Republican Army and he's
[01:43:50.920 --> 01:43:55.320]  now saying we ought to round up Muslims because their potential terrorist
[01:43:55.320 --> 01:44:03.040]  when this guy King himself see it you know if it's if it's Irish terrorism or
[01:44:03.040 --> 01:44:08.520]  Israeli terrorism it seems to be okay with people in this government and in
[01:44:08.520 --> 01:44:13.000]  the Congress and in the White House but if it's if it's any other kind of
[01:44:13.000 --> 01:44:16.600]  terrorism of course we're supposed to become the shdadi and inform on
[01:44:16.600 --> 01:44:20.560]  everybody oh yeah as long as the terrorists are working for them that's
[01:44:20.560 --> 01:44:25.040]  just fine but I mean for those who are you know loath to blame Rahm for the
[01:44:25.040 --> 01:44:30.640]  sins of the father consider consider what he did after Bill Clinton's
[01:44:30.640 --> 01:44:36.320]  reelection in 1996 which is another famous story you know especially in
[01:44:36.320 --> 01:44:41.520]  light of all this recent contrived media rhetoric about telling people to tone
[01:44:41.520 --> 01:44:45.800]  down the vitriol after the Gifford shooting tell tell the listeners what
[01:44:45.800 --> 01:44:53.000]  Rahm Emanuel did during this Clinton reelection celebration in 96 well I
[01:44:53.000 --> 01:44:57.080]  mean there was a couple of weird things that you know he he sent a dead fish to
[01:44:57.080 --> 01:45:01.520]  to a political opponent I mean that's that's right out of the godfather isn't
[01:45:01.520 --> 01:45:05.880]  it I mean I did everything but you know put a horses head on somebody's front
[01:45:05.880 --> 01:45:11.520]  porch he also was stabbed a steak knife into a into a table and every time he
[01:45:11.520 --> 01:45:15.360]  stabbed the knife into the table he said this one's dead this one's dead this
[01:45:15.360 --> 01:45:20.000]  one's dead I mean this is what you got I mean so when I say the kosher version
[01:45:20.000 --> 01:45:24.960]  of the pranos I I'm not exaggerating this is this is this is now he got his
[01:45:24.960 --> 01:45:28.400]  start and they get involved in political campaigns in the 80s mostly
[01:45:28.400 --> 01:45:32.560]  presidential campaign there was a senator Paul Simon's campaign for
[01:45:32.560 --> 01:45:37.080]  president he was from Illinois and that there was John Glenn's presidential
[01:45:37.080 --> 01:45:44.240]  campaign so that's how he got in he's not an attorney his degree is in public
[01:45:44.240 --> 01:45:49.680]  communication that's his background but of course you know in Chicago
[01:45:49.680 --> 01:45:55.120]  he was going to go originally to ballet school you know he was a ballet
[01:45:55.120 --> 01:46:01.920]  dancer but he he's he wound up going to Sarah Lawrence College at Spen
[01:46:01.920 --> 01:46:07.040]  it's a strange leap from in a ballet dancer to a member of the Israeli
[01:46:07.040 --> 01:46:11.200]  Defense Force but going back to that yeah that's that's why I was reading about
[01:46:11.200 --> 01:46:16.200]  before he was he was jamming the knife in the dinner table and screaming out the
[01:46:16.200 --> 01:46:21.560]  name of Clinton's political adversaries and after each name screaming dead dead
[01:46:21.560 --> 01:46:27.000]  dead I mean talk about violent rhetoric this is the administration that's
[01:46:27.000 --> 01:46:31.440]  lecturing is all about violent rhetoric and one of the top guys in there comes
[01:46:31.440 --> 01:46:37.080]  out with this also there was the incident and I mean this is just an
[01:46:37.080 --> 01:46:43.080]  insight into how Rahm Emanuel is such a thoroughly pleasant chap tell the
[01:46:43.080 --> 01:46:46.460]  listeners about the shower incident which of course was featured on this
[01:46:46.460 --> 01:46:52.760]  David Letterman clip right this was during the whole health care bill
[01:46:52.760 --> 01:46:59.760]  debate I represented a very massive Democrat from New York was using the
[01:46:59.760 --> 01:47:05.040]  house to house a representative to an asian shower and where he was confronted
[01:47:05.040 --> 01:47:10.920]  by a naked Rahm Emanuel in the shower who was poking him in the chest with his
[01:47:10.920 --> 01:47:16.920]  finger reading in the riot act about his lack of support for the Obama health
[01:47:16.920 --> 01:47:21.600]  care bill and of course that massive said you know I mean Rahm Emanuel is the
[01:47:21.600 --> 01:47:25.640]  kind of person who would strap his own mother onto the front of a steam locomotive
[01:47:25.640 --> 01:47:30.040]  if he thought they could get it get him some point political points of course
[01:47:30.040 --> 01:47:36.320]  that massive it wound up resigning amidst this scandal and you know it just
[01:47:36.320 --> 01:47:41.640]  seems to me that from talking to people very much involved in that whole
[01:47:41.640 --> 01:47:48.740]  episode that massive was was targeted by some political tricks operation
[01:47:48.740 --> 01:47:54.800]  operating out of the Obama White House I mean I thought we saw enough of that
[01:47:54.800 --> 01:47:58.520]  with Carl Rowe during the Bush administration but apparently it was a
[01:47:58.520 --> 01:48:06.080]  nice transition where we went from Carl Rowe as George Bush's chief hitman
[01:48:06.080 --> 01:48:10.460]  to Obama who had Rahm Emanuel as his chief hitman and now it looks like we
[01:48:10.460 --> 01:48:15.040]  got Bill Daley who's part of this whole Chicago mafia coming in as as the new
[01:48:15.040 --> 01:48:18.800]  Obama chief hitman of course he's probably more concerned about placating
[01:48:18.800 --> 01:48:23.920]  the needs of Wall Street the Goldman Sachs JP Morgan Stanley Chase people
[01:48:23.920 --> 01:48:29.520]  than than anything else but but you look at the whole thing with the takedown of
[01:48:29.520 --> 01:48:34.680]  Rod Bogovitch the governor he obviously knows a lot about people Emanuel
[01:48:34.680 --> 01:48:41.400]  Obama Valerie Jarrett Axelrod Reds Co I mean Reds Co still in solitary
[01:48:41.400 --> 01:48:47.680]  confinement in a he's not even in he although he's been convicted of federal
[01:48:47.680 --> 01:48:54.760]  crimes he's not even in a federal penitentiary he's in he's in solitary and
[01:48:54.760 --> 01:48:59.920]  I mean it's like this guy's one of the rendition people from you know it's
[01:48:59.920 --> 01:49:07.760]  down in Guantanamo exactly I mean by the sounds of it this is the kind of
[01:49:07.760 --> 01:49:12.040]  personality in Rahm Emanuel who would work his way up the political ladder
[01:49:12.040 --> 01:49:16.840]  with you know brute force and intimidation from your research is that
[01:49:16.840 --> 01:49:20.800]  the case is this how he rose to prominence or was it merely you know
[01:49:20.800 --> 01:49:26.400]  political deals with his allies yeah it's a little bit of both the he made
[01:49:26.400 --> 01:49:30.720]  the deals obviously after he left the Clinton White House and you know Hillary
[01:49:30.720 --> 01:49:37.360]  Clinton wanted to fire him in 1993 but it never happened President Clinton
[01:49:37.360 --> 01:49:43.720]  arranged for him to go work for Mack McCarty Chief of Staff but for some
[01:49:43.720 --> 01:49:49.360]  reason Hillary and Rahm Emanuel never got along and during that 08 campaign
[01:49:49.360 --> 01:49:55.080]  remember there is it the Rahm Emanuel for a long time was neutral he only came
[01:49:55.080 --> 01:49:59.400]  out and supported Obama when when Obama started winning in some of those caucus
[01:49:59.400 --> 01:50:04.200]  states and some of the smaller primaries and started build up a build up some
[01:50:04.200 --> 01:50:10.880]  momentum many many came out and supported Obama but but this whole this
[01:50:10.880 --> 01:50:16.160]  whole thing with Rahm Emanuel he leaves takes a job with the Wall Street firm
[01:50:16.160 --> 01:50:21.880]  the Wasserstein and Pirella and then he makes 16 million dollars there which of
[01:50:21.880 --> 01:50:26.680]  course feeds into his congressional campaign in 2002 and the other thing
[01:50:26.680 --> 01:50:31.720]  President Clinton appointed Rahm Emanuel to the board of Freddie Mac and we
[01:50:31.720 --> 01:50:37.360]  know how corrupt all the corruption there was Freddie Mac so it's possible
[01:50:37.360 --> 01:50:41.800]  that Emanuel and the Clintons probably have are in a mutually assured
[01:50:41.800 --> 01:50:47.640]  destruction situation okay we'll be back final segment with Wayne Madsen after

[01:54:59.640 --> 01:55:05.080]  resistance V for victory campaign we're talking with Wayne Madsen
[01:55:05.080 --> 01:55:10.200]  WayneMadsenreport.com and I we're talking about Rahm Emanuel and I just
[01:55:10.200 --> 01:55:14.960]  wanted to touch upon in the final segment what you thought of this scary
[01:55:14.960 --> 01:55:20.960]  interview that Emanuel gave in 2006 with Ben Smith of the New York Post
[01:55:20.960 --> 01:55:25.520]  where he says quote we're going to have universal civil defense training
[01:55:25.520 --> 01:55:30.560]  somewhere between the ages of 18 to 25 you will do three months of training but
[01:55:30.560 --> 01:55:33.840]  there can be nothing wrong with all Americans having a joint similar
[01:55:33.840 --> 01:55:39.440]  experience of what we call civil defense training and then in a later c-span
[01:55:39.440 --> 01:55:45.000]  interview Emanuel said that the civil defense training would be quote
[01:55:45.000 --> 01:55:51.360]  required of everybody so it they were basically floating a plan for a mandatory
[01:55:51.360 --> 01:55:57.080]  civil defense draft which at the time fused with these fears about Obama's
[01:55:57.080 --> 01:56:04.200]  quote civilian national security source Wayne I mean what's what's Rahm's role
[01:56:04.200 --> 01:56:09.240]  in pushing this whole civil drafting is it merely a throwback to his IDF days
[01:56:09.240 --> 01:56:13.440]  and can you see something like this coming to pass in America with the
[01:56:13.440 --> 01:56:19.760]  right crisis well certainly I think it's partly influenced by the fact that
[01:56:19.760 --> 01:56:26.920]  everyone has to serve a through the draft in Israel but it but the whole
[01:56:26.920 --> 01:56:32.720]  concept in a country like the United States seems to harken back to the
[01:56:32.720 --> 01:56:38.800]  brown shirts of Nazi Germany more than more than the Israeli draft military
[01:56:38.800 --> 01:56:45.200]  draft and I think you know the rhetoric like that coupled with you know
[01:56:45.200 --> 01:56:50.200]  internet kill switches and all the other crazy stuff we hear coming out of this
[01:56:50.200 --> 01:56:55.520]  White House from Cass Sunstein and its cognitive infiltration program of
[01:56:55.520 --> 01:57:01.120]  websites and groups I think this this goes to show that the Obama
[01:57:01.120 --> 01:57:06.200]  administration in some respects is actually worse than the previous
[01:57:06.200 --> 01:57:10.240]  administration which may have wanted to push push training might have wanted to
[01:57:10.240 --> 01:57:14.320]  carry some of this out but you know I guess they they they knew how far they
[01:57:14.320 --> 01:57:20.280]  could go where this administration figures there is no goalpost here there
[01:57:20.280 --> 01:57:26.360]  is no end zone they can keep moving the goalpost till they get what they desire
[01:57:26.360 --> 01:57:30.720]  and I think it's it's something less than what we would recognize as a
[01:57:30.720 --> 01:57:36.800]  democracy and just finally for the last couple of minutes tell people about
[01:57:36.800 --> 01:57:41.520]  Wayne Madsen report comm and how they can subscribe to your material then
[01:57:41.520 --> 01:57:47.120]  well it's Wayne Madsen report that comments on one word and they can
[01:57:47.120 --> 01:57:55.600]  subscribe through PayPal or by snail mail and basically I I'm trying to do
[01:57:55.600 --> 01:58:00.200]  what Jack Anderson and Drew Pearson did in Washington for many many years do
[01:58:00.200 --> 01:58:04.920]  the muckraking get the stories out the stuff that never gets past the editors
[01:58:04.920 --> 01:58:08.680]  the publishers of the corporate media in his town because the media in
[01:58:08.680 --> 01:58:16.760]  Washington DC is absolutely controlled okay Wayne Madsen a pleasure speaking
[01:58:16.760 --> 01:58:21.000]  with you thanks for your time we'll be sure to be talking to you again very

[01:58:46.360 --> 01:58:53.560]  demand we are the GCN radio network this is Alex Jones with five good reasons
[01:58:53.560 --> 01:58:57.560]  you should consider buying a solar power generator number one new climate
[01:58:57.560 --> 01:59:01.320]  legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill number two our
[01:59:01.320 --> 01:59:05.280]  new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company allows
[01:59:05.280 --> 01:59:09.640]  you to have it's true total government control of electricity in the name of
[01:59:09.640 --> 01:59:14.080]  smart grid technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the
[01:59:14.080 --> 01:59:18.840]  power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only
[01:59:18.840 --> 01:59:22.640]  compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to
[01:59:22.640 --> 01:59:26.280]  local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from weather
[01:59:26.280 --> 01:59:30.640]  related onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup
[01:59:30.640 --> 01:59:33.880]  insurance and peace of mind folks I really believe in the solar powered
[01:59:33.880 --> 01:59:37.480]  generators offered by solutions from science one of my oldest sponsors you

[01:59:53.920 --> 02:00:01.680]  waging war on corruption Alex Jones on the GCN radio network
[02:00:05.440 --> 02:00:13.440]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you on answers well so does he
[02:00:13.440 --> 02:00:21.840]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex
[02:00:21.840 --> 02:00:24.440]  Jones
[02:00:28.520 --> 02:00:33.840]  standing in for Alex Jones for this last hour it's good to be with all of you I'm
[02:00:33.840 --> 02:00:38.840]  a great fan of Alex in his site today we're going to talk about some of the
[02:00:38.840 --> 02:00:43.160]  issues I'm covering in today's World Affairs brief to give you a view around
[02:00:43.160 --> 02:00:47.640]  the world of what's going on we're going to talk about Hawaii falsifying the
[02:00:47.640 --> 02:00:51.880]  finding of Obama's purported birth certificate we're going to talk about
[02:00:51.880 --> 02:00:55.920]  some of the court rulings that have taken away individual rights or refused to
[02:00:55.920 --> 02:01:00.560]  defend those rights should be a good show so let's start off with Hawaii
[02:01:00.560 --> 02:01:05.560]  despite spending millions of dollars to cover for Obama's past foreign status
[02:01:05.560 --> 02:01:10.960]  as a student and as a youth this issue of his eligibility to be president just
[02:01:10.960 --> 02:01:15.400]  won't die as the Constitution was read in the halls of Congress recently a
[02:01:15.400 --> 02:01:19.120]  woman in the audience yelled out that Obama has violated the Constitution
[02:01:19.120 --> 02:01:23.840]  because he's not a natural born citizen as required and she was removed by force
[02:01:23.840 --> 02:01:28.120]  afraid that's getting to be all too typical including people who even want
[02:01:28.120 --> 02:01:33.680]  to record illegal acts by police they get removed by force it could never I
[02:01:33.680 --> 02:01:38.040]  could never understand why Hawaii didn't simply produce the original long-form
[02:01:38.040 --> 02:01:43.680]  certificate of live birth that Obama claims to have only a computer printout
[02:01:43.680 --> 02:01:48.680]  copy of the information has been shown to various internet sources and even if
[02:01:48.680 --> 02:01:52.280]  the common man doesn't know different in types of birth certificates the state of
[02:01:52.280 --> 02:01:58.120]  Hawaii certainly does let me explain the long form has details of who was
[02:01:58.120 --> 02:02:05.440]  present including a doctor's signature place of birth the hospital name but a
[02:02:05.440 --> 02:02:09.920]  why governor Neil Abercrombie suggested in an interview published yesterday that
[02:02:09.920 --> 02:02:14.200]  the long form hospital generated birth certificate Barack Obama may not exist
[02:02:14.200 --> 02:02:19.240]  within the vital records maintained by the Hawaii Department of Health and
[02:02:19.240 --> 02:02:25.040]  that's absolutely true because one never existed he's not the certified hospital
[02:02:25.040 --> 02:02:31.800]  type certificate name is connected to Obama's Hawaii birth in fact there are
[02:02:31.800 --> 02:02:36.720]  no records in either of the two hospitals mentioned by the Obama campaign as
[02:02:36.720 --> 02:02:41.840]  birth places of his birth not only does he wasn't born in a hospital he wasn't
[02:02:41.840 --> 02:02:46.080]  born in the USA at all the only certificate the Democratic Campaign
[02:02:46.080 --> 02:02:50.560]  Committee has produced is the certification of live birth which is
[02:02:50.560 --> 02:02:56.400]  not a hospital certified doctor signed birth certificate the only document to
[02:02:56.400 --> 02:03:00.720]  be could be obtained by as little as a parent claiming to have witnessed the
[02:03:00.720 --> 02:03:07.000]  birth within that year and date no proof of such a claim is required and I know
[02:03:07.000 --> 02:03:13.120]  personally I we did a home birth in Hawaii for one of our daughters and we
[02:03:13.120 --> 02:03:17.360]  filed for and received a certification of live birth no doctor's signature
[02:03:17.360 --> 02:03:21.880]  required no proof was required we just went in and signed that we had had a
[02:03:21.880 --> 02:03:27.960]  birth in Hawaii and that is apparently what Obama's mother did as well
[02:03:27.960 --> 02:03:35.280]  Abercrombie told the Honolulu star advertiser he was searching for the
[02:03:35.280 --> 02:03:42.640]  definitive vital records that could prove Obama was born trying to make this
[02:03:42.640 --> 02:03:47.920]  controversy go away but suspiciously the next day officials in Hawaii say they've
[02:03:47.920 --> 02:03:54.680]  tracked down papers indicating that Obama was indeed born in Governor Neil
[02:03:54.680 --> 02:03:59.480]  Abercrombie who took office in December told the star he said that our investigation
[02:03:59.480 --> 02:04:03.360]  indicates that there is a recording of his birth it actually exists in the
[02:04:03.360 --> 02:04:10.440]  archives written down he said well we'll have to see we'd like to see what in
[02:04:10.440 --> 02:04:14.600]  fact there is that they have found why is it with all this assurance stuff that
[02:04:14.600 --> 02:04:19.120]  they don't give us the real evidence if they truly have the long-term certificate
[02:04:19.120 --> 02:04:23.840]  on files they surely would have produced it by now now the establishment put out
[02:04:23.840 --> 02:04:29.680]  a forged Kenyan birth certificate in this controversy to try and discredit the
[02:04:29.680 --> 02:04:34.000]  Kenyan claims of his birth there this is a very typical tactic of the
[02:04:34.000 --> 02:04:40.040]  establishment you'll think it's true and they'll create a forgery of it but when
[02:04:40.040 --> 02:04:43.840]  they discover and announce that it was a forgery it discredits not only the
[02:04:43.840 --> 02:04:49.520]  document but the substance that was in the document so by so by producing a
[02:04:49.520 --> 02:04:54.800]  forgery of this Kenyan birth certificate now they can basically write away the
[02:04:54.800 --> 02:05:00.240]  fact that there was no birth in Kenyan but in fact you for a new birth
[02:05:00.240 --> 02:05:06.080]  certificate hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century
[02:05:06.080 --> 02:05:10.840]  alone this is our last chance to not relive history as we're finishing off
[02:05:10.840 --> 02:05:14.880]  this agenda they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home
[02:05:14.880 --> 02:05:20.040]  and have tremendous influence on our president in Congress and they really
[02:05:20.040 --> 02:05:24.840]  are calling the shots I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American
[02:05:24.840 --> 02:05:29.200]  citizens to pay attention for the Republic identifies the enemies of our
[02:05:29.200 --> 02:05:34.480]  nation the criminal offshore cartel hell bent on destroying sovereignty and on
[02:05:34.480 --> 02:05:38.760]  its ashes constructing world government Tim Geithner Bernanke their arsonists
[02:05:38.760 --> 02:05:42.280]  they're asking for more matches and the Congress is saying who do we make the
[02:05:42.280 --> 02:05:47.520]  check out to today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we

[02:08:47.880 --> 02:08:53.480]  brief if anyone wants to get a free sample copy of the brief to see the full
[02:08:53.480 --> 02:09:00.160]  brief they can email me at editor at world affairs brief.com
[02:09:00.160 --> 02:09:04.640]  interestingly the United States is putting an end to the virtual fence on
[02:09:04.640 --> 02:09:09.360]  the border with Mexico if it wasn't bad enough that the US squandered billions
[02:09:09.360 --> 02:09:13.880]  on the virtual fence so that they could have yet another excuse not to build a
[02:09:13.880 --> 02:09:20.520]  physical fence the US is now giving up the virtual fence project as ruling in a
[02:09:20.520 --> 02:09:25.320]  boondoggle that it really was Reuters says President Barack Obama's
[02:09:25.320 --> 02:09:29.640]  administration plans to pull the plug on the troubled virtual fence this is the
[02:09:29.640 --> 02:09:32.880]  first time of course that the public has ever been told that it was in trouble
[02:09:32.880 --> 02:09:38.280]  it was meant to purportedly guard stretches at the US border at lesser
[02:09:38.280 --> 02:09:42.720]  cost than a physical fence but the project run by Boeing Corporation has
[02:09:42.720 --> 02:09:46.920]  cost approximately one billion dollars so far it was meant to pull together
[02:09:46.920 --> 02:09:51.960]  video cameras radar sensors and other technologies to detect smugglers trying
[02:09:51.960 --> 02:09:57.320]  to cross the porous border the problem with the virtual fence of course it says
[02:09:57.320 --> 02:10:01.240]  still requires that you get border patrol agents out there to try to find and
[02:10:01.240 --> 02:10:05.400]  intercept them after they've gone past the surveillance cameras and that's a
[02:10:05.400 --> 02:10:12.480]  very very difficult costly and dangerous project project the physical
[02:10:12.480 --> 02:10:17.080]  fence forcibly keeps people from getting across the border and when it's rigged
[02:10:17.080 --> 02:10:22.080]  with multiple barrier sensors and allows people to target exactly where the
[02:10:22.080 --> 02:10:26.760]  intrusion is coming from you know it's very interesting as pointed out by Alex
[02:10:26.760 --> 02:10:34.640]  before that Canada Poletano had a homeland security was in Afghanistan
[02:10:34.640 --> 02:10:39.160]  telling them how to build a virtual and physical fence that can stop
[02:10:39.160 --> 02:10:43.520]  intrusions of that country and supplying billions in American aid to do just
[02:10:43.520 --> 02:10:49.480]  that yet the Department of Homeland Security won't defend our own borders
[02:10:49.480 --> 02:10:52.960]  well the next topics that we've discussing in the world affairs brief
[02:10:52.960 --> 02:10:57.440]  which has serious implications to our country is what happens when courts
[02:10:57.440 --> 02:11:01.960]  refuse to defend individual rights in our movement we make a lot of the
[02:11:01.960 --> 02:11:06.520]  Constitution and restoring its value to defend individual rights according to
[02:11:06.520 --> 02:11:14.160]  the the intention of the founding fathers but unfortunately our courts are
[02:11:14.160 --> 02:11:20.240]  failing to uphold the Constitution even when they play lip service to it the
[02:11:20.240 --> 02:11:26.360]  Associated Press told us this week about Utah resident Greg Ravel a missing
[02:11:26.360 --> 02:11:31.200]  plane connection cost a Utah gun owner 10 days in jail after he was stranded in
[02:11:31.200 --> 02:11:35.920]  New Jersey with an unloaded firearm he had legally checked with his luggage in
[02:11:35.920 --> 02:11:40.560]  Salt Lake City Ravel was flying from Salt Lake to Allentown, Pennsylvania in
[02:11:40.560 --> 02:11:46.720]  March 31st of 2005 with connections in Minneapolis and Newark he had checked
[02:11:46.720 --> 02:11:50.560]  his Utah licensed gun and ammunition with his luggage in Salt Lake City and
[02:11:50.560 --> 02:11:55.480]  asked the airport officials to deliver them both with this luggage to Allentown
[02:11:55.480 --> 02:11:59.160]  but the flight from Minneapolis to New York was late so Ravel missed his
[02:11:59.160 --> 02:12:03.920]  connection in Allentown or to Allentown from Newark the airline wanted to bus
[02:12:03.920 --> 02:12:08.440]  its passengers to Allentown but Ravel realized that his luggage had not made
[02:12:08.440 --> 02:12:14.320]  it onto the bus and so he got off after finding his luggage had been given a
[02:12:14.320 --> 02:12:18.280]  final destination of Newark by mistake Ravel missed the bus he collected his
[02:12:18.280 --> 02:12:22.560]  luggage including his gun and ammunition and decided to wait in a nearby hotel
[02:12:22.560 --> 02:12:27.320]  with his stuff until the next flight the next morning now when Ravel checks in
[02:12:27.320 --> 02:12:31.200]  the following morning and he again informed the airline officials about his
[02:12:31.200 --> 02:12:36.200]  gun and ammunition to have to check through to Allentown it was reported to
[02:12:36.200 --> 02:12:40.280]  the TSA and then arrested by Port Authority Police for having a gun in
[02:12:40.280 --> 02:12:45.400]  New Jersey without a New Jersey license he spent 10 days in several different
[02:12:45.400 --> 02:12:51.040]  jails before posting bail police dropped the charges a few months later but his
[02:12:51.040 --> 02:12:56.400]  gun and ammunition were not returned in the 2008 so we filed suit against the
[02:12:56.400 --> 02:12:59.520]  state of New Jersey because he was totally legal and having checked
[02:12:59.520 --> 02:13:04.240]  according to all regulations checked his weapon without bullets in it into his
[02:13:04.240 --> 02:13:08.880]  luggage and was doing so the following morning nevertheless the Supreme Court
[02:13:08.880 --> 02:13:14.720]  without any comment refused on this past week to let Ravel sue Port Authority
[02:13:14.720 --> 02:13:20.520]  of New York and New Jersey for the arrest and for where he was arrested on the
[02:13:20.520 --> 02:13:25.000]  illegal possession of a firearm in New Jersey now this is an example of how our
[02:13:25.000 --> 02:13:29.800]  rights are given verbal lip service by government and the courts but not defended
[02:13:29.800 --> 02:13:34.840]  or secured when government intervenes illegally I cited seven more examples
[02:13:34.840 --> 02:13:39.520]  of this in a recent speech that I gave it Utah Valley University called why the
[02:13:39.520 --> 02:13:44.200]  Constitution is essentially dead and how to fix it there's been an overwhelming
[02:13:44.200 --> 02:13:49.840]  response to the speech basically it goes into the evidence that I lay out that
[02:13:49.840 --> 02:13:53.960]  the Constitution is really being disregarded regularly not only by
[02:13:53.960 --> 02:13:59.880]  police courts judges and Congress but that the Constitution can't be restored
[02:13:59.880 --> 02:14:05.400]  without tight a tighter legal language to help avoid the hundreds of thousands
[02:14:05.400 --> 02:14:09.920]  of court precedents that have been used to alter and evade the intent of the
[02:14:09.920 --> 02:14:14.280]  founders you see often in our movement we talk about we've got to restore the
[02:14:14.280 --> 02:14:18.160]  Constitution but when you take that to judges and lawyers in our society today
[02:14:18.160 --> 02:14:21.640]  they say what do you mean restore the Constitution the Constitution is in
[02:14:21.640 --> 02:14:26.480]  vote it's in force right today and you say well we don't mean the way that it's
[02:14:26.480 --> 02:14:30.160]  being enforced we don't like the way that it's being interpreted but we have
[02:14:30.160 --> 02:14:34.520]  millions of lawyers every year that are being trained in the interpretation of
[02:14:34.520 --> 02:14:38.640]  the Constitution according to these court precedents and there's no way to
[02:14:38.640 --> 02:14:43.280]  undo all those court precedents even if you could successfully argue against
[02:14:43.280 --> 02:14:49.680]  them some of them are correct in fact and many are not but the issue is made
[02:14:49.680 --> 02:14:54.400]  moot if we put the constitutional intent into tight legal language and then
[02:14:54.400 --> 02:14:59.080]  that then voids the previous interpretations forcing them to have
[02:14:59.080 --> 02:15:04.920]  to all or to argue on our grounds not theirs now I am not suggesting a
[02:15:04.920 --> 02:15:09.280]  constitutional convention which we could not control in which we would not have
[02:15:09.280 --> 02:15:16.080]  the votes to to hold sway in fact the great danger of a constitutional
[02:15:16.080 --> 02:15:20.560]  convention that we get a worse constitution in inculcating many of
[02:15:20.560 --> 02:15:24.440]  the socialist doctrines which are now done by interpretation what I am
[02:15:24.440 --> 02:15:28.720]  suggesting is that we need to do our homework as constitutional conservatives
[02:15:28.720 --> 02:15:33.800]  in the land and we need to tighten up the language prepare to restore a version
[02:15:33.800 --> 02:15:38.640]  of the Constitution with tight legal language after we have built a base of
[02:15:38.640 --> 02:15:45.440]  support for such a thing if anyone is interested in getting a copy of the
[02:15:45.440 --> 02:15:49.920]  speech why the Constitution is essentially dead and how to fix it they
[02:15:49.920 --> 02:15:55.320]  can go to my website in Joel scowson.com where it talks about that under the
[02:15:55.320 --> 02:16:00.760]  section of law and government well there's a great deal that we need to
[02:16:00.760 --> 02:16:07.080]  talk about in restoring liberty to our country the remaining few minutes here
[02:16:07.080 --> 02:16:11.360]  in this segment let me talk about the discouragement that is often present
[02:16:11.360 --> 02:16:16.040]  with people of our movement in the constitutional conservative movement
[02:16:16.040 --> 02:16:21.080]  conservatives in general and trying to restore liberty one of the biggest
[02:16:21.080 --> 02:16:27.120]  problems that we face is that we run into a wall of resistance from people who
[02:16:27.120 --> 02:16:31.840]  are educated in the mainstream media but who don't understand the principles
[02:16:31.840 --> 02:16:37.160]  or don't have the specific facts about how our government and its liberty is
[02:16:37.160 --> 02:16:42.720]  being undermined I often do a lot of consultation relative to my role as a
[02:16:42.720 --> 02:16:47.360]  high-security designer of homes around the country and expert in strategic
[02:16:47.360 --> 02:16:52.400]  relocation but one of the biggest problems that I run into are people who
[02:16:52.400 --> 02:16:55.880]  have differences of opinion between husband and wife about the severity of
[02:16:55.880 --> 02:16:59.840]  the situation one of the things that I've learned to overcome the
[02:16:59.840 --> 02:17:05.560]  frustration talking to other people about things that you hear on present
[02:17:05.560 --> 02:17:13.720]  planet.com the Alex Jones show is that one really should try to pre-screen the
[02:17:13.720 --> 02:17:18.560]  people that we we speak to I like to restrict myself to people who sense that
[02:17:18.560 --> 02:17:22.720]  something's wrong I think that's a very important criteria if a person hasn't
[02:17:22.720 --> 02:17:28.400]  got any clue at all and what you try to begin to talk to them about will seem
[02:17:28.400 --> 02:17:33.760]  so totally foreign so I think it's important to be able to seek out
[02:17:33.760 --> 02:17:37.720]  people who perceive through the work and subconscious that something's wrong
[02:17:37.720 --> 02:17:42.280]  sufficiently enough to be open to listening to things that I've found is
[02:17:42.280 --> 02:17:49.360]  is a way to take out the frustration of rejection sadly most of us feel alone in
[02:17:49.360 --> 02:17:53.200]  this world we're evenly spread around the world without being in a minority
[02:17:53.200 --> 02:17:57.160]  anywhere I think someday in the very difficulties that will come in the future
[02:17:57.160 --> 02:18:02.720]  there will be chances for us to coalesce and gather together and and hold
[02:18:02.720 --> 02:18:08.400]  greater majorities but until that time I think we have to do our homework and to
[02:18:08.400 --> 02:18:13.640]  build the remnant that is very important to restoring liberty another thing that
[02:18:13.640 --> 02:18:16.640]  I would like to discuss and we'll probably take that in the next segment
[02:18:16.640 --> 02:18:22.600]  as well are some general principles of how we discern truth from falsehoods
[02:18:22.600 --> 02:18:26.480]  there's many things that happen in the world a lot of information out on the
[02:18:26.480 --> 02:18:30.640]  internet and it's very difficult sometimes to discern that I think we have
[02:18:30.640 --> 02:18:34.720]  to be very very careful first of all to talk about things that are too good to
[02:18:34.720 --> 02:18:39.600]  be true insiders that claim to be constantly feeding us information about
[02:18:39.600 --> 02:18:44.640]  government illegal activities we have to ask ourselves first and foremost how
[02:18:44.640 --> 02:18:48.720]  would someone who claims to have deep and regular insider access and claims to
[02:18:48.720 --> 02:18:54.240]  be on our side continue to review those things without being discovered well in
[02:18:54.240 --> 02:18:58.240]  fact no such leaks are possible on a long-term basis without government
[02:18:58.240 --> 02:19:03.240]  knowing about it government surveils all communications and would discover and
[02:19:03.240 --> 02:19:07.440]  shut down any whistleblower very quickly if it's information threatened to
[02:19:07.440 --> 02:19:12.760]  expose certain truths that's any claim it claimed insider who continues to feed
[02:19:12.760 --> 02:19:16.560]  information to our side must be considered a permitted leaker and the
[02:19:16.560 --> 02:19:21.040]  information tended should be considered suspect now there are legitimate ways to
[02:19:21.040 --> 02:19:25.560]  track conspiracies using inductive reasoning applied to anomalies in the
[02:19:25.560 --> 02:19:30.400]  official government version of events or the inevitable cover-ups but we should
[02:19:30.400 --> 02:19:37.360]  still be skeptical that it claims to know too much from the inside we also
[02:19:37.360 --> 02:19:41.120]  need to watch out for people who use Christianity as a credential watch out
[02:19:41.120 --> 02:19:45.720]  sources that can't be traced some claiming to have insider aspect through
[02:19:45.720 --> 02:19:50.600]  access to Russian intelligence or US intelligence those are some of the
[02:19:50.600 --> 02:19:56.360]  things that will be helpful to us to understand how to judge the news what is
[02:19:56.360 --> 02:20:05.560]  true do you have more than four hot flash episodes a day do you ever wake up at
[02:20:05.560 --> 02:20:09.640]  night soaked in sweat do you experience mood swings heightened emotions or

[02:21:05.760 --> 02:21:10.080]  to retire and live out their golden years unfortunately with taxation the
[02:21:10.080 --> 02:21:14.640]  rising cost of food energy housing and medical many retirees are forced to
[02:21:14.640 --> 02:21:18.720]  live below the poverty line is this a flaw for enterprise or is our monetary
[02:21:18.720 --> 02:21:21.880]  unit we call the Federal Reserve note forcing us into perpetual debt
[02:21:21.880 --> 02:21:26.240]  ensuring inflation in higher taxes these questions and more can be answered by

[02:25:01.920 --> 02:25:07.480]  campaign which you can read about and get involved in at prisonplanet.com
[02:25:07.480 --> 02:25:12.160]  Joel Scowson world affairs brief you were talking before the break about the
[02:25:12.160 --> 02:25:18.640]  need to discern truth from falsehoods and without mentioning any names because
[02:25:18.640 --> 02:25:22.520]  don't want to give them any attention because they don't deserve it there are
[02:25:22.520 --> 02:25:28.920]  entire websites out there which in my view are as bad or even worse than the
[02:25:28.920 --> 02:25:35.440]  establishment media because the whole operation is based on inventing stories
[02:25:35.440 --> 02:25:41.520]  and so-called inside information out of thin air so I mean Joel delve further
[02:25:41.520 --> 02:25:46.840]  into that and why it represents such a threat to our success in communicating
[02:25:46.840 --> 02:25:52.440]  with people well that's right Paul it's very important for people to understand
[02:25:52.440 --> 02:25:58.880]  that conspiracy is real in life and there is a credible evidence of it but
[02:25:58.880 --> 02:26:02.760]  the fastest way to discredit conspiracy is to throw out a lot of false
[02:26:02.760 --> 02:26:08.440]  conspiracy theory and false conspiracy claims that can be easily
[02:26:08.440 --> 02:26:13.840]  debunked that's what you know a straw man argument is they put
[02:26:13.840 --> 02:26:19.800]  up a straw man as they did in the JFK assassination or even 9-11 and then
[02:26:19.800 --> 02:26:24.080]  something that's easy to knock down I think it's very very important that
[02:26:24.080 --> 02:26:29.080]  people really take a scrutinizing look at what comes across the net that's why
[02:26:29.080 --> 02:26:34.920]  I talked about those principles that's too good to be true especially you know
[02:26:34.920 --> 02:26:38.920]  and I think we it's not necessary to mention names as you say but there's
[02:26:38.920 --> 02:26:42.400]  quite a few out there and even sincere people I think it's important to realize
[02:26:42.400 --> 02:26:46.840]  that everybody who puts out a false conspiracy theory isn't necessarily on
[02:26:46.840 --> 02:26:51.040]  the other side there are people who are sincere that simply get snookered by
[02:26:51.040 --> 02:26:56.040]  people who give them information that they perceive as true and one of those
[02:26:56.040 --> 02:27:01.720]  you know as the story that ran around the internet about the guys in FEMA
[02:27:01.720 --> 02:27:05.960]  jackets telling a county official that there was going to be a bank holiday
[02:27:05.960 --> 02:27:10.000]  and everybody pulled their money out of the bank and it was a Christian who was
[02:27:10.000 --> 02:27:13.880]  promoting this or the claim that he was a Christian and so it made it very easy
[02:27:13.880 --> 02:27:20.680]  for people to to accept it but in fact it turned out to be totally bogus and
[02:27:20.680 --> 02:27:26.480]  also whenever you hear something coming from Vladimir Putin's inside sources
[02:27:26.480 --> 02:27:32.600]  take it with a very large pinch of salt going to the callers fill in Ohio your
[02:27:32.600 --> 02:27:35.480]  question for Joel scousen fill you're on the air
[02:27:35.480 --> 02:27:44.600]  hi just a couple of suggestions I listen to Alex every day on the be for
[02:27:44.600 --> 02:27:53.280]  victory campaign I think it could be immediately effective and after I heard
[02:27:53.280 --> 02:28:01.880]  as I started doing it have a first entry and last entry on every email you
[02:28:01.880 --> 02:28:10.240]  send put a big V on the front and back the other one is most people have eight
[02:28:10.240 --> 02:28:18.280]  and a half by 11 sheets of paper put a large V and paste it or post it on your
[02:28:18.280 --> 02:28:25.080]  rear and side windows of the vehicles you drive if that starts all around the
[02:28:25.080 --> 02:28:31.520]  world I think that would be pretty effective the other is using one of
[02:28:31.520 --> 02:28:37.640]  those eight and a half by 11's put it in a sheet protector and put it on your
[02:28:37.640 --> 02:28:45.800]  front door so those are the the ones I had and I do enjoy listening to you
[02:28:45.800 --> 02:28:52.400]  Paul thanks thanks for the call all excellent ideas that's right signatures
[02:28:52.400 --> 02:28:56.600]  on emails so every time you send someone an email the big V appears at the
[02:28:56.600 --> 02:29:01.480]  bottom of it bumper stickers you know signs in the doorway just like you
[02:29:01.480 --> 02:29:06.200]  would have for a political candidate and if we can get the ball rolling on this
[02:29:06.200 --> 02:29:11.640]  big time it can be you know even more massive than the Obama Joker campaign
[02:29:11.640 --> 02:29:18.440]  which went global and got tons of media attention Rob in Idaho you're on the
[02:29:18.440 --> 02:29:25.360]  air with Joel Scouse and go ahead Rob yes two things I hear bumper music

[02:29:59.440 --> 02:30:05.600]  Alex told you the government announced recently that the recession is over it
[02:30:05.600 --> 02:30:10.560]  ended on June of 2009 the millions of Americans unable to find work might not
[02:30:10.560 --> 02:30:14.680]  agree perhaps a recession ended for the bankers and government employees but
[02:30:14.680 --> 02:30:18.280]  for the rest of us things seem to be getting worse gold and silver haven't
[02:30:18.280 --> 02:30:22.360]  heard the news either they've begun their long expected journey to the moon in
[02:30:22.360 --> 02:30:26.000]  addition to converting your shrinking dollars into gold and silver you should

[02:30:33.920 --> 02:30:38.360]  precious than any financial resource you and your family need food to survive a
[02:30:38.360 --> 02:30:43.000]  crisis and you can't eat paper stocks or metals Alex has been urging you to

[02:31:04.440 --> 02:31:08.800]  solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily double
[02:31:08.800 --> 02:31:12.960]  or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control
[02:31:12.960 --> 02:31:17.000]  how much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total
[02:31:17.000 --> 02:31:20.880]  government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is
[02:31:20.880 --> 02:31:25.160]  coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously
[02:31:25.160 --> 02:31:29.280]  overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the
[02:31:29.280 --> 02:31:33.600]  problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every
[02:31:33.600 --> 02:31:37.320]  year thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages number
[02:31:37.320 --> 02:31:41.520]  five a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of
[02:31:41.520 --> 02:31:44.520]  mind folks I really believe in the solar power generators offered by

[02:34:09.160 --> 02:34:17.280]  on the air with Joel Scousen go ahead yes you know Joel's been a resource for a
[02:34:17.280 --> 02:34:23.080]  lot of things and we only disagree with him on one but but at the same time
[02:34:23.080 --> 02:34:29.960]  and that's on you ought to understand that the velocity of sound or shock in
[02:34:29.960 --> 02:34:36.040]  steel is is 20 times that which it is in air and one of those turbines came
[02:34:36.040 --> 02:34:41.560]  across when the towers were hit believe me there would be two explosions heard
[02:34:41.560 --> 02:34:47.320]  in the sub basements but anyway Joel my question and you might consider that
[02:34:47.320 --> 02:34:54.400]  with with some of your interpretations but but I I would like to ask you and
[02:34:54.400 --> 02:35:01.840]  you and I both know what's going on yeah but the general public does not and see
[02:35:01.840 --> 02:35:05.680]  him how Alex reads it reaches a lot of people and doesn't cover this much I
[02:35:05.680 --> 02:35:13.200]  wonder if you could discuss what the strategic that is the nuclear biological
[02:35:13.200 --> 02:35:20.440]  and chemical strengths are of the UN and and a manpower of the United States
[02:35:20.440 --> 02:35:29.880]  versus the Russians and the Chinese okay good to talk to you again Bob Bob's
[02:35:29.880 --> 02:35:35.600]  also someone who is made some very coaching comments on various radio shows
[02:35:35.600 --> 02:35:40.320]  that I've heard or participated in before the threat of Russian China or very
[02:35:40.320 --> 02:35:44.800]  very real relative to biological chemical and nuclear weapons we know a lot
[02:35:44.800 --> 02:35:50.400]  more about the Russian arsenals than we do about the Chinese relative size
[02:35:50.400 --> 02:35:54.640]  interesting enough is that the United States is essentially put all of the
[02:35:54.640 --> 02:36:00.320]  stockpiles into disposal readiness meaning that they're being disposed of
[02:36:00.320 --> 02:36:06.160]  and I believe that most of those in fact have gone through the Russians in fact
[02:36:06.160 --> 02:36:12.320]  have not many whistleblowers have come out of the post fall Soviet Union period
[02:36:12.320 --> 02:36:16.240]  and talked about continuing biological chemical weapons factories in
[02:36:16.240 --> 02:36:21.280]  underground locations probably in the Yamantou complex in the Ural Mountains
[02:36:21.280 --> 02:36:26.120]  this is a underground factory bunker system probably the size of the
[02:36:26.120 --> 02:36:31.440]  Washington DC metro area underground it's huge there's a similar system about
[02:36:31.440 --> 02:36:37.040]  15 kilometers away called the Jesvinsky Mountain and our inspectors have never
[02:36:37.040 --> 02:36:41.680]  been inside there you know the Chinese we know virtually nothing about they've
[02:36:41.680 --> 02:36:46.560]  been very few defectors come out of China talking about their weapon systems
[02:36:46.560 --> 02:36:52.040]  except to confirm that they're undergoing massive weapons rearmament
[02:36:52.040 --> 02:36:59.480]  especially in the nuclear realm and the delivery system realm I think they're
[02:36:59.480 --> 02:37:04.440]  starting their first aircraft carrier now and but before they get ready to
[02:37:04.440 --> 02:37:08.280]  strike the West it's my feeling that they need a full blue water Navy they're
[02:37:08.280 --> 02:37:14.480]  planning on capturing the entire eastern Pacific from Japan all the way down
[02:37:14.480 --> 02:37:20.280]  through Australia New Zealand and that's why in my new addition to strategic
[02:37:20.280 --> 02:37:24.840]  relocation I don't recommend the nations of New Zealand and Australia even
[02:37:24.840 --> 02:37:28.680]  though they're very nice right now for relocation they're basically selling out
[02:37:28.680 --> 02:37:33.040]  to the Chinese and will probably be occupied during the next war making
[02:37:33.040 --> 02:37:40.480]  them very difficult for Americans who have been expatriates over there thanks
[02:37:40.480 --> 02:37:45.560]  to the call Bob regarding the first point it's my understanding that William
[02:37:45.560 --> 02:37:50.800]  Rodriguez who works of course as a janitor in the World Trade Center reported
[02:37:50.800 --> 02:37:54.920]  explosions in the basement levels before the first plane hit so I'm not sure
[02:37:54.920 --> 02:37:59.760]  why the engines of the plane are an issue in that story when he clearly
[02:37:59.760 --> 02:38:05.360]  reports that the explosion took place before the plane hit Kyle in Pennsylvania
[02:38:05.360 --> 02:38:09.920]  yeah go ahead go ahead Joel well I just wanted to confirm that that the
[02:38:09.920 --> 02:38:13.680]  explosion that occurred in the tower was before the plane hit so it would have
[02:38:13.680 --> 02:38:19.480]  been irrelevant also scientifically though the engine spinning and turbines
[02:38:19.480 --> 02:38:24.360]  don't enhance an explosion significantly at least in terms of the pressure
[02:38:24.360 --> 02:38:27.880]  weight getting it all the way down to the basement there's also the point that
[02:38:27.880 --> 02:38:32.920]  the video of the firefighters going into the basement or going into lobby after
[02:38:32.920 --> 02:38:39.080]  that explosion showed no black smoke hovering or clouding near the ceiling
[02:38:39.080 --> 02:38:42.840]  so if it were a fuel-induced fire it would have been black smoke throughout
[02:38:42.840 --> 02:38:47.920]  the lobby Kyle in Pennsylvania you're on the air with Joel Scousen go ahead
[02:38:47.920 --> 02:38:54.280]  Kyle hey Paul and Joel really fantastic show I'm really enjoying it I guess my
[02:38:54.280 --> 02:38:59.440]  question would be if there were a checklist or puzzle pieces that you
[02:38:59.440 --> 02:39:04.160]  think that the New World Order needed to get their goal their global government
[02:39:04.160 --> 02:39:08.840]  what would still be left on that list and or what do you think we should
[02:39:08.840 --> 02:39:14.480]  anticipate next what do you think is gonna be next down the road well that's
[02:39:14.480 --> 02:39:18.600]  a very very good question there's only one thing on the checklist in my
[02:39:18.600 --> 02:39:23.120]  opinion they need to actually implement the full New World Order with the
[02:39:23.120 --> 02:39:28.320]  minimum amount of resistance and that's a full on Third World War probably with
[02:39:28.320 --> 02:39:32.680]  a nuclear attack on America the reason I say that is because even though they
[02:39:32.680 --> 02:39:38.480]  have been slowly getting Americans used to at British and the Europeans used to
[02:39:38.480 --> 02:39:43.280]  controls at an international level when you start actually inconveniencing
[02:39:43.280 --> 02:39:55.160]  people such as you know taking someone a rancher in North Carolina and we lost
[02:39:55.160 --> 02:40:03.800]  Joel okay we'll get Joel back on the line in the meantime next caller is Brad
[02:40:03.800 --> 02:40:13.120]  in Michigan go ahead Brad Paul thank you for all your work that you do we we
[02:40:13.120 --> 02:40:20.000]  really appreciate you Mr. Skeleton my question would be with the all this
[02:40:20.000 --> 02:40:24.040]  about Ron Paul wanting to audit and investigate the Fed how important do you
[02:40:24.040 --> 02:40:32.600]  feel that will be and will that really make much of a difference well Joel
[02:40:32.600 --> 02:40:39.160]  yes go ahead okay I am fully supportive of Ron Paul's desire to audit the Fed
[02:40:39.160 --> 02:40:44.000]  personally I don't think it will ever be allowed in any large degree for example
[02:40:44.000 --> 02:40:49.880]  the partial audit that just took place was in fact full of loopholes that there
[02:40:49.880 --> 02:40:54.600]  were most of the secret things were not in that audit we learned enough about it
[02:40:54.600 --> 02:40:59.960]  to engender I think another cry for an audit but this is a real secret financial
[02:40:59.960 --> 02:41:04.280]  conspiracy where money's flowing around the world as we speak unknown to the
[02:41:04.280 --> 02:41:08.320]  American people and it would cause it you in an outcry I don't think they'll
[02:41:08.320 --> 02:41:14.080]  allow it I think they have the votes to stop Ron Paul and that don't even think
[02:41:14.080 --> 02:41:19.320]  they'll allow an audit of the gold stocks or each and where the real power of
[02:41:19.320 --> 02:41:23.200]  money is among the central banks in the United States but it's very important if
[02:41:23.200 --> 02:41:29.880]  we can get it and in the in the push toward it the Fed certainly Ron Paul
[02:41:29.880 --> 02:41:35.040]  possibly going to become a senator he says he's still considering the
[02:41:35.040 --> 02:41:41.760]  presidential run in 2012 but he's also considering running for senator there in
[02:41:41.760 --> 02:41:46.120]  the house so I mean if he becomes a senator obviously that push toward it
[02:41:46.120 --> 02:41:51.320]  the Fed will only gain more prominence and credibility Kevin in Alabama you're
[02:41:51.320 --> 02:41:58.000]  on the air with Joel Scowles and go ahead yes hello hi Kevin what's your
[02:41:58.000 --> 02:42:04.280]  question today yes Paul doing a great job question for Mr. Scowles and also a
[02:42:04.280 --> 02:42:10.720]  comment he was talking about earlier about how to get through to people who
[02:42:10.720 --> 02:42:17.120]  are really not yet awake about what's going on really in this country and I
[02:42:17.120 --> 02:42:22.560]  think that was a good point and could he expound upon that how I would have to
[02:42:22.560 --> 02:42:27.200]  say I've talked to my mother about these things and of course she's of a
[02:42:27.200 --> 02:42:34.280]  different decade a different you know grew up when you believed in in the in
[02:42:34.280 --> 02:42:39.680]  the news at least three major networks and so I wouldn't want to put it upon
[02:42:39.680 --> 02:42:45.160]  her to try to get through to her because she really thinks I'm crazy about the
[02:42:45.160 --> 02:42:50.600]  new world order and so on and so forth so I would appreciate if he would expound
[02:42:50.600 --> 02:42:54.560]  upon that and if he thinks it's a good idea that people pick up the phone and
[02:42:54.560 --> 02:43:00.400]  call their congressmen and senators and and what else can we do to to hold on
[02:43:00.400 --> 02:43:05.320]  to our liberties thank you so much well that's a good question you know we can
[02:43:05.320 --> 02:43:10.000]  slow things down by putting pressure on Congress and it does work when we
[02:43:10.000 --> 02:43:14.800]  unelected a lot of congressmen after the wave of gun control that they put in or
[02:43:14.800 --> 02:43:18.840]  the democrats put in the even the democrats themselves are just afraid
[02:43:18.840 --> 02:43:22.880]  to death to do any more gun control that's why they keep throwing these
[02:43:22.880 --> 02:43:29.760]  false flag or other you know evil terrorists of domestic terrorists or
[02:43:29.760 --> 02:43:34.680]  shooting events on people in order to provoke this type of thing but I think
[02:43:34.680 --> 02:43:37.960]  it's very important to give people a little bit of the time and make sure
[02:43:37.960 --> 02:43:42.240]  that it's absolutely credible what you give in for example when I deal with
[02:43:42.240 --> 02:43:46.240]  people who are very reluctant first of all I don't try to push upon somebody
[02:43:46.240 --> 02:43:50.240]  who's just dead set against learning the truth when they put up those walls and
[02:43:50.240 --> 02:43:55.000]  say you know you're crazy I don't try but for people who are legitimately
[02:43:55.000 --> 02:44:00.600]  interested in there are some really open shut proofs of quotes that show
[02:44:00.600 --> 02:44:06.000]  illegal activities or interference in the affairs of government one of the
[02:44:06.000 --> 02:44:11.040]  best happens to be the quotation by general James Jones at the Munich
[02:44:11.040 --> 02:44:16.080]  Security Conference in February of last year where he said the relative to
[02:44:16.080 --> 02:44:23.280]  honoring Henry Kissinger that we at the National Security Agency not agency but
[02:44:23.280 --> 02:44:27.760]  the council receive our daily marching orders from Henry Kissinger filtered
[02:44:27.760 --> 02:44:31.920]  down through Brentsgoe, Croft and Sandy Berger who are here with us today there
[02:44:31.920 --> 02:44:37.120]  was an open admission of someone who is not an elected official government
[02:44:37.120 --> 02:44:41.720]  directing the National Security Council as to how the government and their
[02:44:41.720 --> 02:44:46.560]  relationship with the president should work and that's a provable quote it's a
[02:44:46.560 --> 02:44:51.240]  very powerful thing which will tend to open people's eyes so don't try to give
[02:44:51.240 --> 02:44:54.800]  them everything at once but give them certain things that are just undeniable
[02:44:54.800 --> 02:45:00.720]  so that it does open their eyes. Thanks for the call we're going to Europe it's
[02:45:00.720 --> 02:45:07.960]  divine in Denmark divine you're on the air go ahead. Hey thank you Paul and Joe
[02:45:07.960 --> 02:45:14.440]  I'm first time caller I've been listening for quite a while I really
[02:45:14.440 --> 02:45:21.640]  appreciate what you guys are doing for Infowars and I think this whole thing
[02:45:21.640 --> 02:45:26.480]  going on with Obama and his bad certificate issue with him not trying to
[02:45:26.480 --> 02:45:32.600]  come out and let people know on which side he's on it's a real problem for
[02:45:32.600 --> 02:45:38.520]  for American people and for the world as well and I think you'll be it'll be
[02:45:38.520 --> 02:45:42.640]  smarter if he would just let people know because the truth is already out there
[02:45:42.640 --> 02:45:50.280]  and for him trying to hide his situation and keep telling the American people that
[02:45:50.280 --> 02:45:56.280]  he's got a bad certificate that makes him an American citizen and being
[02:45:56.280 --> 02:46:03.600]  eligible to be an American president is it's just complete baloney and he can't
[02:46:03.600 --> 02:46:08.400]  really hide anymore so he just have to come out and let people know and I
[02:46:08.400 --> 02:46:13.680]  actually had a problem a question for I don't know which one of you angst I
[02:46:13.680 --> 02:46:20.000]  probably Joe or maybe you Paul Watson but it's got to do with with this
[02:46:20.000 --> 02:46:28.520]  forthright as we all know the setting up for for a new world order and I think
[02:46:28.520 --> 02:46:32.720]  from from history what what we know about history we know that the the Roman
[02:46:32.720 --> 02:46:38.000]  Catholic Church has always been intimately involved in setting up this
[02:46:38.000 --> 02:46:44.000]  even the first rights the second rights and the third rights of Adolf Hitler so
[02:46:44.000 --> 02:46:51.640]  my question is is this as we know that the Vatican as well is still involved in
[02:46:51.640 --> 02:46:57.880]  setting up the forthright but on Alex's show he never really talks about it the
[02:46:57.880 --> 02:47:05.200]  connection between the Jesuit order and and and the Roman Catholic Church and
[02:47:05.200 --> 02:47:10.800]  how they intimately behind this whole conspiracy because we know as well the
[02:47:10.800 --> 02:47:16.440]  the Vatican is one of the largest corporations in the world looking at
[02:47:16.440 --> 02:47:25.120]  their their wealth and and assets and also from the book written by by Jim
[02:47:25.120 --> 02:47:30.760]  Mass the the rise of the forthright he talks about this even also in the book
[02:47:30.760 --> 02:47:38.760]  written by John Conwell it lasts it lasts scientists and also the book written
[02:47:38.760 --> 02:47:49.160]  by Paul Eric no sorry Eric John Flames the Vatican assassins he also talks
[02:47:49.160 --> 02:47:54.840]  about how the Vatican was intimately involved in all this conspiracy all
[02:47:54.840 --> 02:47:59.920]  all of us I would like you guys to talk to that okay Joel what's your take on
[02:47:59.920 --> 02:48:07.080]  that well it's a very difficult question to respond to I ran into as a
[02:48:07.080 --> 02:48:11.600]  political consultant down there with the Jesuits in Latin America for many years
[02:48:11.600 --> 02:48:18.760]  like I've lived in Argentina Oulu by Guatemala and El Salvador so they were
[02:48:18.760 --> 02:48:24.400]  a very leftist organization which had a very leftist agenda and worked hand in
[02:48:24.400 --> 02:48:29.560]  glove with many of the communists to bring them into power and I did not see
[02:48:29.560 --> 02:48:35.280]  anything coming down from the Vatican to try to to stop them clearly I think that
[02:48:35.280 --> 02:48:39.400]  there has been some infighting within the College of Cardinals in the Vatican
[02:48:39.400 --> 02:48:42.360]  there is a conservative wing of the Catholic Church and there's a very
[02:48:42.360 --> 02:48:47.120]  left wing at the Catholic Church there are many indeed questions about the
[02:48:47.120 --> 02:48:52.000]  Vatican funding the Vatican Bank is and the Vatican itself is treated as an
[02:48:52.000 --> 02:48:58.120]  international separate nation but my only problem with some of the books that
[02:48:58.120 --> 02:49:01.880]  have been written about it is they they come into the category of people who
[02:49:01.880 --> 02:49:08.800]  claim to know too much and that's why I doubt some of the veracity of the
[02:49:08.800 --> 02:49:13.840]  claims in other words I'm not willing to go on record to say that I know
[02:49:13.840 --> 02:49:17.760]  specifically where the Catholic Church might fit into this I know they've had
[02:49:17.760 --> 02:49:23.720]  there some very difficult dealings with Europe with Israel trying to impose
[02:49:23.720 --> 02:49:28.920]  upon Israel in an international new world order over Vatican and in other
[02:49:28.920 --> 02:49:33.520]  sites international jurisdiction so there is indication in my mind that
[02:49:33.520 --> 02:49:38.080]  there is a new world order faction within the Catholic Church and certainly
[02:49:38.080 --> 02:49:42.960]  there have been folks who have compromised with the communists in
[02:49:42.960 --> 02:49:50.840]  bringing in the power in Europe as well as in Germany in particular so that's
[02:49:50.840 --> 02:49:57.840]  about all I can say at this time and of course it's it's true to say that like
[02:49:57.840 --> 02:50:03.560]  many religious and political groups at the time just before Hitler came to
[02:50:03.560 --> 02:50:08.640]  power as Chancellor they were all bargaining for political positions in
[02:50:08.640 --> 02:50:14.680]  1930s Germany and it's also true to say that the Roman Catholic Church failed to
[02:50:14.680 --> 02:50:19.040]  speak out against the Holocaust but so did many religious and political
[02:50:19.040 --> 02:50:28.600]  organizations at the time in 1930s and 1940s Germany Todd in North Carolina go
[02:50:28.600 --> 02:50:37.720]  ahead hey Paul and Joel appreciate the conversation today one dimension to Joel
[02:50:37.720 --> 02:50:43.720]  that I've really enjoyed the video interview that's on prisonplanet.tv and

[02:55:02.840 --> 02:55:07.120]  lately and trying to he's been trying to dig into it with Charlie Isherby and
[02:55:07.120 --> 02:55:16.720]  others and Paul just an additional kind of request there's a movie called the
[02:55:16.720 --> 02:55:22.120]  edge of darkness I think it was originally a British mini series or
[02:55:22.120 --> 02:55:26.040]  whatever it was made into a major motion picture with Mel Gibson a couple of
[02:55:26.040 --> 02:55:31.040]  years ago I'd love to see you all do an expose on that movie like you did on the
[02:55:31.040 --> 02:55:37.960]  road a lot of great parallels with what's going on today Joel Scousen well
[02:55:37.960 --> 02:55:43.480]  I was involved in Washington when the CNP was formed so I know a lot about it
[02:55:43.480 --> 02:55:49.480]  I was chairman of the conservative national committee organization that we
[02:55:49.480 --> 02:55:54.360]  formed together with Richard Bigary who ran conservative digest and Howard
[02:55:54.360 --> 02:55:59.440]  Phillips of the conservative caucus and others formed the heritage foundation
[02:55:59.440 --> 02:56:04.360]  and as soon as the CNP was formed as they're very meant to be a very strong
[02:56:04.360 --> 02:56:07.200]  lobbying organization to try to keep the Reagan administration from
[02:56:07.200 --> 02:56:11.000]  compromising it immediately got infiltrated with a lot of mainstream
[02:56:11.000 --> 02:56:17.040]  Republican people and so it has been watered down in an in effectiveness and
[02:56:17.040 --> 02:56:22.320]  it won't take views which I think are essential towards exposing the
[02:56:22.320 --> 02:56:27.160]  conspiratorial nature of the forces that control both Republican and the
[02:56:27.160 --> 02:56:33.080]  Democratic Party it is not however an evil organization per se as many have
[02:56:33.080 --> 02:56:37.840]  accused and I think Charlotte sometimes has felt that way but it is one of those
[02:56:37.840 --> 02:56:42.520]  organizations been infiltrated in the to keep it moderate so to speak meaning
[02:56:42.520 --> 02:56:49.000]  not to take positions which will really harm the establishment and I believe you
[02:56:49.000 --> 02:56:53.480]  touch upon that in your interview for prisonplanet.tv which we recently
[02:56:53.480 --> 02:56:59.280]  posted where you talk about also the infiltration of the Tea Party Peter in
[02:56:59.280 --> 02:57:05.920]  Canada quick question please go ahead Peter hello Paul and Joel Joel a lot of
[02:57:05.920 --> 02:57:10.160]  smart people I listen to say a US dollar collapse and global financial collapse is
[02:57:10.160 --> 02:57:14.160]  imminent or could happen in one to three years people like Bob Chapman, Gerald
[02:57:14.160 --> 02:57:18.000]  Slanty, John Williams, and Charlotte Stats are on this opinion I've heard you say
[02:57:18.000 --> 02:57:21.600]  they can keep this game running for up to 10 more years what is your opinion
[02:57:21.600 --> 02:57:26.600]  differs from these others? Well my opinion differs for two reasons one I
[02:57:26.600 --> 02:57:32.000]  understand that there is a conspiracy to create a new world order and they're not
[02:57:32.000 --> 02:57:35.840]  about to give us an excuse to attack them or un-elect them or get them out
[02:57:35.840 --> 02:57:39.160]  of office and that's why I think they're going to milk this thing along and
[02:57:39.160 --> 02:57:43.640]  secondly I'm the only one who preaches against hyperinflation because of the
[02:57:43.640 --> 02:57:48.080]  massive quantity of dollars internationally exists they can inflate
[02:57:48.080 --> 02:57:53.720]  up to 10 trillion dollars a year and not even get close to anything above a
[02:57:53.720 --> 02:58:00.520]  10% inflation of the money supply and very few have ever analyzed that
[02:58:00.520 --> 02:58:09.640]  position from that view. Okay thanks for the call and Andre and Navada very
[02:58:09.640 --> 02:58:14.040]  quick we're running out of time Andre go ahead. Hi guys I just wanted to say
[02:58:14.040 --> 02:58:17.320]  thank you for everything that you're doing I thank you guys for opening my
[02:58:17.320 --> 02:58:21.320]  eyes and my family's eyes but my question is basically I've been paying
[02:58:21.320 --> 02:58:28.680]  attention to different publications and everything like that in US news they had
[02:58:28.680 --> 02:58:33.880]  a magazine come out and they're titled Secret Societies and I look into it. We'll
[02:58:33.880 --> 02:58:37.560]  speak about it next time Andre we've run out of time thanks to Joel Scowsen
[02:58:37.560 --> 02:59:00.560]  this is the Alex Jones show Alex will be back Sunday.
