[00:00.000 --> 00:10.840]  It's Wednesday, October 12, 2016, Danny Williams is in the green room, he's going to be live,
[00:10.840 --> 00:14.720]  the reported son of Bill Clinton, I believe he is the son of Bill Clinton, but first a
[00:14.720 --> 00:16.360]  key report, stay with us.
[00:16.360 --> 00:21.320]  Yeah, that's it, with the gold, I've got to use some tic-tac just in case I start kissing
[00:21.320 --> 00:22.320]  her.
[00:22.320 --> 00:26.560]  You know, I'm automatically attracted to beautiful, I just start kissing them, it's like a magnet,
[00:26.560 --> 00:32.680]  I don't need to wait, and when you're a star they let you do it, you can do anything, grab
[00:32.680 --> 00:36.640]  them by the ****, you can do anything.
[00:36.640 --> 00:42.800]  This latest controversy marks a divide, when those who are aware of the CIA-controlled
[00:42.800 --> 00:49.680]  media, protecting the interests of the multinational corporate elites pawn, Hillary Clinton, react
[00:49.680 --> 00:56.200]  in disgust, and the disgust from those who still think that reality is as it seems.
[00:56.200 --> 00:59.440]  Are we going to hold that to Hillary Clinton, to the things when she apologized?
[00:59.440 --> 01:04.360]  Oh, wait a minute, she never really apologized for insulting the horrible bias.
[01:04.360 --> 01:08.680]  What did you do the day you saw the tape of this man boasting about grabbing a woman's
[01:08.680 --> 01:09.680]  ****?
[01:09.680 --> 01:10.680]  Period.
[01:10.680 --> 01:17.480]  We please stop saying that word, my daughter is listening, don't tell me you're an offended
[01:17.480 --> 01:21.720]  one, I say ****, but you're not offended when Donald Trump said it, I'm not running
[01:21.720 --> 01:23.120]  for president, he is.
[01:23.120 --> 01:28.400]  If only they could just open their eyes for a moment, they would actually see that totalitarianism
[01:28.400 --> 01:30.880]  is warping that accepted reality.
[01:30.880 --> 01:37.320]  George Orwell described totalitarianism as such, a society living by and for continuous
[01:37.320 --> 01:44.560]  warfare in which the ruling caste have ceased to have any real function but succeed in clinging
[01:44.560 --> 01:47.760]  to power through force and fraud.
[01:47.760 --> 01:53.400]  Hillary Clinton is just the latest villain from a long line of mind controlling near-duels
[01:53.400 --> 01:58.040]  that have ruled over the United States since it was inevitably infiltrated by the global
[01:58.040 --> 02:05.760]  elite central bank scam in 1913, systematically kept in line by methods of manufactured terror.
[02:05.760 --> 02:10.920]  Building 7, I often hear about, and no plane hit building 7, why did building 7 come down?
[02:10.920 --> 02:11.920]  What do you tell people?
[02:11.920 --> 02:13.400]  What is building 7?
[02:13.400 --> 02:14.400]  Building 7.
[02:14.400 --> 02:17.920]  I have no idea, I've never heard that.
[02:17.920 --> 02:22.960]  An assassination of the United States greatest leaders by a shadow government that pretends
[02:22.960 --> 02:29.940]  to misplace trillions of taxpayer dollars only to fund its Luciferian class war domination
[02:29.940 --> 02:31.280]  over humanity.
[02:31.280 --> 02:36.720]  More money for the Pentagon when its own auditors admit the military cannot account for 25%
[02:36.720 --> 02:38.640]  of what it already spends.
[02:38.640 --> 02:43.920]  According to some estimates, we cannot track $2.3 trillion in transactions.
[02:43.920 --> 02:51.080]  $2.3 trillion with a T, that's $8,000 for every man, woman and child in America.
[02:51.080 --> 02:56.080]  To understand how the Pentagon can lose track of trillions, consider the case of one military
[02:56.080 --> 03:00.080]  accountant who tried to find out what happened to a mere 300 million.
[03:00.080 --> 03:03.800]  We know it's gone, but we don't know what they spent it on.
[03:03.800 --> 03:09.840]  What Trump said amounts to nothing, nothing compared to her husband's rape victims, some
[03:09.840 --> 03:15.820]  of them brutally raped, only to be attacked publicly by Hillary after the deed was done.
[03:15.820 --> 03:22.320]  She grabbed a hold of my arm and my hand, and she pulls me into her, and she says with
[03:22.320 --> 03:29.200]  this very angry look on her face, which had been so pleasant seconds before, and in a
[03:29.200 --> 03:34.680]  low voice says, do you understand everything you do?
[03:34.680 --> 03:35.680]  And that frightened me.
[03:35.680 --> 03:37.180]  I feel like she knew.
[03:37.180 --> 03:38.680]  That he ripped you.
[03:38.680 --> 03:42.160]  Yes, and that she was telling me to keep quiet.
[03:42.160 --> 03:47.160]  Nothing compared to the savagery Middle Eastern women endure, and Hillary ignores, only to
[03:47.160 --> 03:52.120]  push the divide and conquer refugee invasion narrative, a fiction that will eventually
[03:52.120 --> 03:56.680]  lead to the rape of thousands of unsuspecting American women and children.
[03:56.680 --> 04:01.000]  Nothing compared to the bodies hidden along Hillary's path to power.
[04:01.000 --> 04:05.340]  Nothing compared to the thousands that have died in the name of Secretary of State Hillary
[04:05.340 --> 04:10.900]  Clinton's rape of Northern Africa due to the conquest of rich men's wars, perpetual
[04:10.900 --> 04:16.160]  wars fought in the perceived name of freedom and democracy, only benefiting the wealthy
[04:16.160 --> 04:21.600]  that become wealthier by playing both sides, maiming and killing our brave fighting men
[04:21.600 --> 04:23.560]  and women in the process.
[04:23.560 --> 04:27.920]  In fact, what Trump said should actually strengthen your resolve.
[04:27.920 --> 04:32.760]  You see, 11 years ago when Trump said this, he wasn't a politician.
[04:32.760 --> 04:38.600]  He wasn't being groomed and compromised like CIA plant Hillary has been her entire political
[04:38.600 --> 04:39.600]  life.
[04:39.600 --> 04:43.500]  He was just a guy like so many other guys, just making a joke.
[04:43.500 --> 04:48.840]  If you want to see a sexual predator, take the blinders off and look no further than
[04:48.840 --> 04:50.720]  Hillary's right-hand man.
[04:50.720 --> 04:57.040]  And I'm not referring to the genderless Illuminati sellout, Tim Kaine, John Bound for Infowars.com.
[04:57.040 --> 04:59.720]  We'll be back with Danny Williams and more.
[04:59.720 --> 05:05.280]  In the second presidential debate, Donald J. Trump came out and really called out Bill
[05:05.280 --> 05:10.480]  Clinton for his rapes and how Hillary Clinton enabled him and helped cover it up and also
[05:10.480 --> 05:12.640]  threatened people in the process.
[05:12.640 --> 05:17.160]  Now we have an article by Breitbart.com, exclusive video, Clinton's Defenders.
[05:17.160 --> 05:20.160]  These are crimes terrified of enabler Hillary.
[05:20.160 --> 05:24.840]  In an exclusive video interview with the presidential suite of the historic Watergate Hotel, the
[05:24.840 --> 05:29.600]  victims of Bill Clinton's alleged sexual assault, Juanita Broderick, Kathleen Wiley and Paula
[05:29.600 --> 05:34.160]  Jones got together for the first time in person to express their personal fear of Hillary
[05:34.160 --> 05:39.440]  Clinton and to warn voters that Clinton does not stand for women's issues.
[05:39.440 --> 05:43.120]  Something we've been saying since day one, she doesn't care about you women.
[05:43.120 --> 05:44.120]  Why?
[05:44.120 --> 05:45.120]  Because she's a pander.
[05:45.120 --> 05:46.120]  She gets rapists off.
[05:46.120 --> 05:47.120]  She lives with her rapist.
[05:47.120 --> 05:48.640]  She enables rapists.
[05:48.640 --> 05:54.440]  So on November 8, make sure you get up off your couch and go and vote for the man who
[05:54.440 --> 05:56.680]  will make America great again.
[05:56.680 --> 05:59.200]  This has been Joe Biggs with InfoWars.com.
[05:59.200 --> 06:05.600]  Uh, yeah, first of all, I want to say, secret 12, that's two SuperMail, BrainForce, Prostigar,
[06:05.600 --> 06:06.600]  SilverBullet.
[06:06.600 --> 06:07.600]  I use them all.
[06:07.600 --> 06:08.600]  They're phenomenal.
[06:08.600 --> 06:09.600]  They work.
[06:09.600 --> 06:10.600]  Buy InfoWars.
[06:10.600 --> 06:11.600]  Thank you, brother.
[06:11.600 --> 06:12.600]  Thank you guys for putting those out there.
[06:12.600 --> 06:18.040]  I am a relatively short-time listener and I'm a quite a supporter of your fine, fine
[06:18.040 --> 06:19.040]  products.
[06:19.040 --> 06:20.040]  Welcome to the InfoWars.

[06:25.440 --> 06:26.440]  at the same time.
[06:26.440 --> 06:27.440]  I'm a nine-year listener.
[06:27.440 --> 06:29.440]  I buy all the nutraceuticals, Casio FX, Nacinotide.
[06:29.440 --> 06:30.440]  Right.
[06:30.440 --> 06:32.080]  God, let me ask you a question.
[06:32.080 --> 06:33.080]  Have they worked for you?
[06:33.080 --> 06:36.000]  They're the most unbelievable products I've ever had in my life.
[06:36.000 --> 06:37.000]  What products are you taking?
[06:37.000 --> 06:38.000]  Are you taking?
[06:38.000 --> 06:45.320]  Everything from SuperMail to BrainForce to Wintersun, X2, even got a little DNA force.
[06:45.320 --> 06:49.160]  So when I just re-upped everything and I just went to Autofill.
[06:49.160 --> 06:54.080]  That's InfoWars.com to read the information and research and to see the reviews for yourselves.
[06:54.080 --> 07:00.160]  That's InfoWars.com or call 888-253-3139.
[07:00.160 --> 07:02.560]  Electrify your day with Secret 12.
[07:02.560 --> 07:04.080]  It's like lightning in a bottle.
[07:04.080 --> 07:07.880]  We all have days in which we just can't seem to perform at the level we'd like to.
[07:07.880 --> 07:08.880]  InfoWars.
[07:08.880 --> 07:13.040]  Secret 12 is designed to naturally energize your body and mind with two great tasting
[07:13.040 --> 07:16.160]  and super high quality forms of vitamin B12.
[07:16.160 --> 07:20.880]  Super vitamin and nutrient intake is essential to keep your body functioning at optimum levels.
[07:20.880 --> 07:25.440]  The reality is, it's hard to take in the proper amount of vitamins we need each day with our
[07:25.440 --> 07:26.600]  modern diets.
[07:26.600 --> 07:32.040]  Secret 12 by InfoWars.com is an easy way to naturally upgrade your vitamin B12 intake
[07:32.040 --> 07:34.440]  and support your body's natural systems.
[07:34.440 --> 07:39.440]  It pairs two forms of vitamin B12 into one explosive formula.
[07:39.440 --> 07:43.240]  Vitamin B12 supports healthy energy levels through red blood cell formation and aiding
[07:43.240 --> 07:48.640]  in the body's natural processes, but it also assists with many other functions of the body.
[07:48.640 --> 07:52.280]  Electrify your mind and body and take your health to the next level.

[07:55.760 --> 07:58.760]  That's InfoWars.com.
[07:58.760 --> 08:10.600]  I mean, she is an abject psychopathic demon from hell that as soon as she gets into power
[08:10.600 --> 08:12.120]  is going to try to destroy the planet.
[08:12.120 --> 08:15.560]  She's worked like a demon, as you know, it's like her state.
[08:15.560 --> 08:20.440]  We came, we saw, we died.
[08:20.440 --> 08:23.360]  What difference at this point does it make?
[08:23.360 --> 08:28.760]  And there's only one candidate in this race who understands that democracy in a big diverse
[08:28.760 --> 08:34.760]  country doesn't work if you constantly demonize each other, demonize each other.
[08:34.760 --> 08:40.120]  You could put half of Trump supporters into what I call the basket of deplorables.
[08:40.120 --> 08:45.440]  And I mean that literally by the way, I was reading the other day, there's a guy on the
[08:45.440 --> 08:51.080]  radio who apparently Trump's on a show frequently, he said me and Hillary are demons.
[08:51.080 --> 08:58.080]  I'm telling you, she is a demon.
[08:58.080 --> 08:59.080]  This is biblical.
[08:59.080 --> 09:02.800]  She's going to launch a nuclear war.
[09:02.800 --> 09:07.800]  Said we smell like sulfur.
[09:07.800 --> 09:23.600]  Now, I mean, come on, people.
[09:23.600 --> 09:29.560]  You can't watch that evil off and I'm not kidding, people say, they say, folks, I've
[09:29.560 --> 09:34.280]  been told this by high up folks, they say, listen, Obama and Hillary both smell like
[09:34.280 --> 09:35.280]  sulfur.
[09:35.280 --> 09:38.200]  I never said this because the media go crazy with it, but I've talked to people that are
[09:38.200 --> 09:39.200]  in protective details.
[09:39.200 --> 09:44.680]  I mean, they're scared out there and they say, listen, she's a frickin' demon and she
[09:44.680 --> 09:48.360]  stinks and so does Obama, I go like, what, sulfur?
[09:48.360 --> 09:51.360]  They smell like hell.
[09:51.360 --> 09:57.720]  On November 8th, the arrogance of Washington DC will come face to face with the righteous
[09:57.720 --> 10:02.280]  verdict of the American voter, it's about time.
[10:02.280 --> 10:09.280]  So much of what he's just said is not right, but he gets to run his campaign any way he
[10:09.280 --> 10:10.280]  chooses.
[10:10.280 --> 10:20.320]  Max Butch, a neocon at the Council on Fine Relations, which admits it operates the shadow
[10:20.320 --> 10:21.320]  government.
[10:21.320 --> 10:25.760]  Hillary Clinton has said that in four different speeches and written about it in two books,
[10:25.760 --> 10:32.240]  wrote a big story over the weekend with the headline, the alt-right is destroying itself,
[10:32.240 --> 10:34.520]  listening to its own media.
[10:34.520 --> 10:41.620]  And he said that we were in an echo chamber and that we were failing.
[10:41.620 --> 10:46.240]  When mainstream corporate media is a shadow of its former self, it has 6% trust, according
[10:46.240 --> 10:50.800]  to the Associated Press' own research, of itself.
[10:50.800 --> 10:54.880]  I mean, North Korea, the people have more faith in their media.
[10:54.880 --> 10:59.440]  There it is, Republicans are paying the price for their addiction to their own media.
[10:59.440 --> 11:06.480]  And what they do is they sit there and create a perception that we're all crazy and take
[11:06.480 --> 11:09.320]  what we say out of context.
[11:09.320 --> 11:13.680]  But the truth is, the new media, whether it's left-wing, right-wing, libertarianism matter,
[11:13.680 --> 11:16.440]  is exploding.
[11:16.440 --> 11:21.520]  Mainstream media is corporately funded, but is collapsing.
[11:21.520 --> 11:25.640]  And so if you go look at the news every day, it's always Trump in trouble, Trump to drop
[11:25.640 --> 11:26.640]  out.
[11:26.640 --> 11:28.000]  Trump loses all of his support.
[11:28.000 --> 11:29.360]  Trump can't raise any money.
[11:29.360 --> 11:32.360]  Out of the blue, 30-something Republicans turn against him.
[11:32.360 --> 11:37.280]  They were all the same Republicans that said that if you voted for him, the nomination
[11:37.280 --> 11:40.200]  didn't count and that your popular vote didn't count.
[11:40.200 --> 11:42.280]  So they were just waiting within minutes.
[11:42.280 --> 11:47.480]  And Jerry Falwell Jr. actually got calls and met with the top Republicans that warned
[11:47.480 --> 11:52.560]  him seven weeks ago that this was coming, and he told Trump, well, I mean, of course
[11:52.560 --> 11:54.360]  it's coming.
[11:54.360 --> 11:58.880]  They even said, oh, there'll be, you know, three months, four months after the nomination
[11:58.880 --> 12:04.680]  for us to still get Trump, and that's what they did.
[12:04.680 --> 12:08.520]  And then, boom, they take this tape, which is nothing compared to John McCain or Obama
[12:08.520 --> 12:11.000]  or Bill Clinton in their talk.
[12:11.000 --> 12:17.280]  They edit it, they take it out of context, and then it's the end of the world.
[12:17.280 --> 12:18.800]  It's Trump's resigning.
[12:18.800 --> 12:19.800]  It's over.
[12:19.800 --> 12:22.600]  We heard that three times the last few months for other scandals.
[12:22.600 --> 12:29.200]  Meanwhile, Hillary represents convicted criminals across the board who then get indicted again
[12:29.200 --> 12:31.040]  for things like child molestation.
[12:31.040 --> 12:34.400]  Hillary Clinton makes jokes about it on tape knowing that they were innocent.
[12:34.400 --> 12:35.400]  Hillary represents jihadis.
[12:35.400 --> 12:37.160]  Hillary represents foreign governments.
[12:37.160 --> 12:38.680]  She's everything she says Trump is.
[12:38.680 --> 12:42.040]  She says Trump won't work for U.S. interests, he'll work for his own when she's the one
[12:42.040 --> 12:45.160]  working against U.S. interests.
[12:45.160 --> 12:49.200]  And so then I baited the media a few days ago, I don't even say it on the tape I am,
[12:49.200 --> 12:51.360]  that Hillary and Obama are literal demons.
[12:51.360 --> 12:57.800]  Now, I was told by protective details, both military and secret service, that I said,
[12:57.800 --> 13:00.240]  why do they always have flies landing on them?
[13:00.240 --> 13:01.640]  We saw it happen during the debate.
[13:01.640 --> 13:05.880]  In fact, in the Middle Ages and even in ancient times before that, a fly landing on someone
[13:05.880 --> 13:11.360]  when it wasn't on anybody else was seen as a symbol of death or evil.
[13:11.360 --> 13:19.920]  They would paint them in middle-aged paintings, dark-age paintings, Renaissance paintings
[13:19.920 --> 13:24.640]  of a fly on a skull or a fly on a person as a sign of death.
[13:24.640 --> 13:28.400]  There's paintings of Judas, Ascariot, that betrayed Christ, famous Renaissance paintings
[13:28.400 --> 13:30.640]  with a fly on him.
[13:30.640 --> 13:35.160]  And so we just said, isn't it an archetypal that Hillary's becoming the Lord of the Flies
[13:35.160 --> 13:38.120]  as the Bible says, the devil's the Lord of the Flies?
[13:38.120 --> 13:40.680]  And then Obama, all of the world has flies landing on him when they're not landing on
[13:40.680 --> 13:42.400]  anybody else, they're landing on her.
[13:42.400 --> 13:44.680]  It's archetypal.
[13:44.680 --> 13:51.680]  It's tongue-in-cheek when I say absolute literal demon from hell.
[13:51.680 --> 13:55.440]  She's obviously not an absolute literal her body, but I do believe in the Bible, I do
[13:55.440 --> 13:58.920]  believe there's evil influence, and obviously Hillary Clinton's an evil person that brags
[13:58.920 --> 14:03.080]  about overthrowing countries and letting jihadis into murder hundreds of thousands of Christians.
[14:03.080 --> 14:08.280]  And her internal emails show her hatred for the public and the common people and folks
[14:08.280 --> 14:12.480]  that live in their parents' basements and baristas, her own supporters and her own emails
[14:12.480 --> 14:19.040]  show this, and more are coming out of her hatred for the public.
[14:19.040 --> 14:22.040]  Remember when I came out and I said, we need to know that they're going to try to federalize
[14:22.040 --> 14:29.160]  and take over the election because Trump is so far ahead in all the major internal polls.
[14:29.160 --> 14:32.640]  Obama came out two days later and said, oh, that guy in Texas, there's no such thing as
[14:32.640 --> 14:33.640]  election fraud.
[14:33.640 --> 14:37.600]  That's like saying there's no such thing as wildfires or no such thing as daisies or
[14:37.600 --> 14:44.040]  no such things as automobiles, I mean, it's just ridiculous on its face.
[14:44.040 --> 14:49.080]  And then two weeks later they go, emergency, the Russians and others are going to hack
[14:49.080 --> 14:52.440]  all the systems and steal it for Trump, we've got to federalize the elections.
[14:52.440 --> 14:53.520]  And what did I say at the time?
[14:53.520 --> 14:59.000]  I said, watch some land security claiming they're stopping hacks.
[14:59.000 --> 15:01.080]  That will be the hack.
[15:01.080 --> 15:06.240]  And they did exactly as I said, oh, but the mainstream media is so smart, they come out
[15:06.240 --> 15:07.240]  and go.
[15:07.240 --> 15:14.200]  They go over for Trump, Alex Jones says we're literal demons, we're devils, oh my gosh,
[15:14.200 --> 15:15.200]  isn't it kooky?
[15:15.200 --> 15:22.200]  See, they're all run by CIA people and there's more anthropologists and sociologists and
[15:22.200 --> 15:27.640]  psychologists in the CIA than there are commandos and historians.
[15:27.640 --> 15:32.600]  And they're all obsessed with knowing the subgroup and seeing us all as, you know, pygmy
[15:32.600 --> 15:41.720]  villagers or something or, you know, ancient Germanic villagers, they see us as animals
[15:41.720 --> 15:46.480]  and they're up there calculating our culture and calculating our background and looking
[15:46.480 --> 15:52.040]  at how we operate and keeping us in the dark while they're part of the future.
[15:52.040 --> 15:55.840]  And they say that, the new WikiLeaks emails, it's just full of how they control us and
[15:55.840 --> 15:59.560]  they have all the answers and they know everything.
[15:59.560 --> 16:05.080]  I covered some of those yesterday where they said, we want to keep the public unaware and
[16:05.080 --> 16:06.080]  compliant.
[16:06.080 --> 16:07.080]  Remember that?
[16:07.080 --> 16:12.600]  That's the top of the campaign.
[16:12.600 --> 16:19.320]  So the way they do it is saying, you're a loser, you failed, there's no awakening.
[16:19.320 --> 16:25.640]  You understand until the day that the United States Army Air Corps dropped two ABOBS, Fat
[16:25.640 --> 16:32.640]  Man and Little Boy, on Hiroshima and Nakasaki, Tokyo Rose was on a super powerful AM transmitter
[16:32.640 --> 16:37.360]  every hour saying, you have lost, your ships have been sunk, your fleets are defeated, it's
[16:37.360 --> 16:40.960]  all over, you're dead.
[16:40.960 --> 16:41.960]  And that's what this is.
[16:41.960 --> 16:45.840]  Now, now 20 years ago, they had the upper hand, they were beating us and I was telling
[16:45.840 --> 16:49.200]  you, we're getting beat, we're in trouble, it's horrible, we got to mobilize.
[16:49.200 --> 16:53.360]  I don't sit here and like try to, like Oprah Winfrey's the secret and speak things into
[16:53.360 --> 16:54.360]  reality.
[16:54.360 --> 16:55.960]  There's no action to do that.
[16:55.960 --> 17:00.840]  I said over and over again, we had to turn the tide, we'd expose globalism, the puppet
[17:00.840 --> 17:04.560]  masters, not the puppets, they can always replace the puppets, but not the puppet masters.
[17:04.560 --> 17:06.040]  We've got to expose that.
[17:06.040 --> 17:08.800]  I'm going to skip this break.
[17:08.800 --> 17:13.080]  And that's what I did over and over and over again, you did that, others did it because
[17:13.080 --> 17:17.280]  you could see classical psychological warfare they were using.
[17:17.280 --> 17:21.880]  So Max Boot of the Council on Foreign Relations, the group sworn to create world government
[17:21.880 --> 17:26.040]  end our sovereignty, I mean, every publication they put out every two months admits that.
[17:26.040 --> 17:31.040]  They put out stuff five years ago saying, why we need al-Qaeda in Syria and admitted
[17:31.040 --> 17:33.960]  our government was financing al-Qaeda now known as ISIS.
[17:33.960 --> 17:37.000]  I mean, they hide this stuff in plain view.
[17:37.000 --> 17:40.680]  You can go to Barnes and Noble every two months, it comes out, Bar and Affairs.
[17:40.680 --> 17:45.720]  It's on a magazine, it's like a book, a little green book, about 200 pages thick.
[17:45.720 --> 17:50.800]  And I sit here and read what they're saying, what they're doing.
[17:50.800 --> 17:56.000]  They think you're so unintellectual that you'll never look into it all.
[17:56.000 --> 18:01.640]  And know that I'm not telling you my opinion, I'm telling you word for word, what they've
[18:01.640 --> 18:04.440]  said and what they've done and what they stand for.
[18:04.440 --> 18:08.760]  So he talks about the right wing is in an echo chamber, hey brother, you're in an echo
[18:08.760 --> 18:10.880]  chamber and you know it.
[18:10.880 --> 18:15.520]  I'm not right wing, I'm a constitutionalist, I'm a patriot, I transcend your left right
[18:15.520 --> 18:16.520]  system.
[18:16.520 --> 18:23.240]  Now, your modern left is a bunch of fascist, control freak, victim, useful idiot morons
[18:23.240 --> 18:31.800]  who I am exposing with very harsh language to try to shake them out of their mind control
[18:31.800 --> 18:40.120]  stupor of invincible ignorance and wearing their ignorance like it's a crown of enlightenment.
[18:40.120 --> 18:44.800]  But I'm not here trying to use their ignorance against them, I'm trying to empower them because
[18:44.800 --> 18:48.360]  when they're empowered, those of us that are already more enlightened and smarter than
[18:48.360 --> 18:51.400]  they are, we will rise even higher.
[18:51.400 --> 18:54.200]  You can't lower people and not lower yourself.
[18:54.200 --> 19:02.560]  That's a metaphysical rule of the universe, it's natural law that everything's interconnected
[19:02.560 --> 19:04.800]  and these globalists are like cancer.
[19:04.800 --> 19:08.280]  They think because they take over and dominate because they're evil, they are the enlightened
[19:08.280 --> 19:11.440]  ones and the dominant ones, no, you're the malfunctioning cancer.
[19:11.440 --> 19:16.120]  If I get cancer, you get cancer and it kills us, the cancer cells die too, don't they?
[19:16.120 --> 19:20.040]  But they're not conscious, they just think, I do whatever I want, I take over whatever
[19:20.040 --> 19:21.840]  I want.
[19:21.840 --> 19:23.640]  That's conquest versus renaissance.
[19:23.640 --> 19:29.960]  Now, I'm going to get into all the big news here, but there are just a wall of stories,
[19:29.960 --> 19:33.400]  Trump is over, Trump's a loser, Trump's an idiot, you know, if you vote for Trump, you
[19:33.400 --> 19:37.360]  lose, he's going to lose, he's 10 points, 20 points, 30 points, 80 points, I mean, I've
[19:37.360 --> 19:43.640]  seen articles where they're saying he's 30 points behind and then you read the poll
[19:43.640 --> 19:46.520]  and they're sampling 60% more Democrats than Republicans.
[19:46.520 --> 19:52.600]  I mean, it is getting crazy because again, they think they can put in the methodology
[19:52.600 --> 19:57.160]  of the poll the fact that it's totally fake but you're too dumb to understand what sampling
[19:57.160 --> 20:05.840]  46% Democrats and 22% Republicans means or sampling 42% Democrats and 19% Republicans.
[20:05.840 --> 20:08.800]  And then Bloomberg comes out and says, well, we're not going to do that, we're only going
[20:08.800 --> 20:17.680]  to sample 10% more, we're more scientific or Politico, they only sampled 7% more.
[20:17.680 --> 20:21.560]  Oh, and then Hillary was only winning by two points in that when they had him at a dead
[20:21.560 --> 20:22.560]  heat.
[20:22.560 --> 20:27.480]  See, all of America should be flipping out at just the way they're running the polls,
[20:27.480 --> 20:33.480]  the way they turned his microphone off two debates ago, the way they interrupt him 70
[20:33.480 --> 20:37.520]  times, 40 times, Hillary, six times, three times.
[20:37.520 --> 20:41.200]  When you see something this rigged and the whole corrupt establishment throwing everything
[20:41.200 --> 20:47.200]  it's got at the public, you've got to know that Donald Trump's the man, doesn't mean
[20:47.200 --> 20:50.760]  he's perfect, doesn't mean his feet won't have to be held to the fire.
[20:50.760 --> 20:55.960]  But we know the Clintons, they're the most archetypal corrupt out of control group that
[20:55.960 --> 20:56.960]  I could possibly imagine.
[20:56.960 --> 20:58.480]  Now, here's what's coming up today.
[20:58.480 --> 21:02.880]  Speaking of censorship, speaking of control, I want to show TV viewers this article right
[21:02.880 --> 21:03.880]  here.
[21:03.880 --> 21:20.600]  This is DrudgeReport.com, CNN boss Jeff Zucker has directly ordered network staff not to
[21:20.600 --> 21:27.200]  cover shocking allegations made by Arkansas resident Danny Williams.
[21:27.200 --> 21:32.400]  The Drudge Report has learned Williams, who is set to give his first TV interview today
[21:32.400 --> 21:36.400]  on infowars.com, claims to be Bill Clinton's biological son.
[21:36.400 --> 21:44.400]  Jeff thinks it is ridiculous hoax, a top CNN source said.
[21:44.400 --> 21:49.360]  I always felt bad about Bill Clinton not wanting to be in my life, Williams explains in the
[21:49.360 --> 21:52.160]  video released Monday.
[21:52.160 --> 21:53.800]  Was it because I was black?
[21:53.800 --> 21:55.400]  Was there something wrong with me?
[21:55.400 --> 22:01.080]  It made me think sometimes even of suicide.
[22:01.080 --> 22:10.040]  It's not fair and it's been hurtful, Hillary, please do not deny I exist, I am your step
[22:10.040 --> 22:11.040]  son.
[22:11.040 --> 22:12.040]  So all of that is developing.
[22:12.040 --> 22:13.520]  But what's the bigger story here?
[22:13.520 --> 22:17.120]  It'll be in studio in about an hour, whether he's in the room right next to us right now.
[22:17.120 --> 22:22.360]  We're about to tweet out photos of he and I during the last break here in the studio.
[22:22.360 --> 22:26.560]  Photo of Danny standing in front of our big TV screen right here with CNN orders blackout
[22:26.560 --> 22:28.560]  on Clinton's son.
[22:28.560 --> 22:36.080]  Now there it is, tweeted at real Alex Jones and it's not like this guy just popped up
[22:36.080 --> 22:40.240]  like the media saying I was on air 21 years ago and interviewed his aunt.
[22:40.240 --> 22:48.360]  I remember interviewing her Christian church lady.
[22:48.360 --> 22:52.480]  I remember having the Arkansas state troopers on.
[22:52.480 --> 22:56.720]  I remember hearing about the money being delivered to the little shack $700 a month and the Christmas
[22:56.720 --> 23:02.040]  presents until he tried to go to the mansion in little rock down the street a few miles
[23:02.040 --> 23:08.800]  away and climb the fence and go to the front door and meet Bill Clinton.
[23:08.800 --> 23:13.880]  But Hillary had the state police come out and run him off for how his mother ran in
[23:13.880 --> 23:19.200]  with the baby years before when he was a baby.
[23:19.200 --> 23:23.240]  And Bill Clinton you got a hand into him actually had some heart and some soul and try to take
[23:23.240 --> 23:29.800]  care of his son that wasn't his son why would he do that?
[23:29.800 --> 23:33.400]  Please Hillary do not deny exist I am your stepson that is coming up so how does the
[23:33.400 --> 23:34.400]  media respond?
[23:34.400 --> 23:43.040]  Oh, the head of CNN Jeff Zucker just says I think it's ridiculous hopes close quote
[23:43.040 --> 23:47.200]  so he believes it just like they said in the last year never talk about Hillary's health
[23:47.200 --> 23:50.400]  don't let anybody talk about her falling down now we know she does now we know there's
[23:50.400 --> 23:56.520]  a cover up they say don't talk about all these other things because the head of CNN
[23:56.520 --> 24:00.960]  has told everybody you don't do it same thing with MSNBC so it's our job at Info Wars to
[24:00.960 --> 24:06.080]  break through that electronic Berlin wall and to force that discussion does Alex Jones
[24:06.080 --> 24:10.920]  get demonized do I get attacked do I get ridiculed by mainstream media absolutely and 15 years
[24:10.920 --> 24:19.720]  ago that would hurt us they still had maybe 40% credibility they have 6% credibility.
[24:19.720 --> 24:24.160]  This is a criminal deceptive combine that admittedly the WikiLeaks prove even more get
[24:24.160 --> 24:29.360]  daily directives and talking points we already know that and it's the non talking point media
[24:29.360 --> 24:34.600]  that's only a handful of groups that now has more viewers and listeners than all the giant
[24:34.600 --> 24:39.040]  spectrum of mainstream media that's falling apart and their answer as they fall apart
[24:39.040 --> 24:46.400]  is to get the wagons closer together to centralize the control even more I have a stack of WikiLeaks
[24:46.400 --> 24:51.360]  after the break I'm gonna go over that show that the latest ones total control when she's
[24:51.360 --> 24:59.560]  on CNN when she's on MSNBC there is a teleprompter behind the reporter he's asking prepared questions
[24:59.560 --> 25:03.680]  she is responding in a totally scripted event we already knew that from the emails now it
[25:03.680 --> 25:09.640]  comes out that the whole thing's scripted word for word actors actresses at her events
[25:09.640 --> 25:14.440]  fake town halls when she does have real ones people show up behind her with Bill Clinton
[25:14.440 --> 25:20.440]  rape shirts Obama goes out in public yesterday three people over 20 minutes pop up and say
[25:20.440 --> 25:27.960]  Bill Clinton's a rapist and expose it he then goes into the whole diet tribe that oh this
[25:27.960 --> 25:31.960]  demonization campaign this talk show host he wouldn't name but everybody in the news
[25:31.960 --> 25:37.320]  CNN your name and Alex Jones says I'm literally a demon and stink well I mean I ask why they're
[25:37.320 --> 25:40.440]  always flies landing on you and Hillary and they said we don't know what it is but they
[25:40.440 --> 25:46.280]  both smell and they didn't say sulfur that actually said like I guess age you know what
[25:46.280 --> 25:51.800]  I don't know what's going on you people but hey mouse a tongue reportedly stunk so bad
[25:51.800 --> 26:01.000]  he when he was young no look it up linen totally stunk these people just I guess they don't
[26:01.000 --> 26:06.400]  care about anybody so you take bath or something I don't know the point is is that she funds
[26:06.400 --> 26:10.320]  jihadi's worldwide because hundreds of thousands of Christians that's demonic they fund a mortuary
[26:10.320 --> 26:15.360]  selling eighth and ninth month baby parts they keep babies alive while they butcher them they
[26:15.360 --> 26:23.960]  try to cover up that Obama hates bitter clingers on the Bible and the guns but the most interesting
[26:23.960 --> 26:28.920]  part is they say how dare them become so mean and vitriolic they say we're doing that because
[26:28.920 --> 26:33.360]  we're losing no we defeated you trying to block the Tea Party Liberty Movement it's
[26:33.360 --> 26:38.000]  surging you know it you actually admit that your internal WikiLeaks we covered it yesterday
[26:38.000 --> 26:43.040]  they admit we're winning they're losing so what do they do they say we're being mean
[26:43.040 --> 26:49.720]  you say that half of the Trump supporters are deplorable racist then you say I'm racist
[26:49.720 --> 26:56.920]  with no history or no statement of that you then say your surrogates on CNN MSNBC ABC
[26:56.920 --> 27:03.320]  say actually all Trump supporters are deplorable Trump supporters are attacked nationwide physically
[27:03.320 --> 27:12.120]  Trump towers are fire bombed vandalized on a weekly basis you call us all sorts of horrible
[27:12.120 --> 27:21.520]  names you say we don't support Obamacare that's a giant screw job that we're racist all that's
[27:21.520 --> 27:28.120]  okay all that's okay but then we stand up for ourselves and you again try to dictate
[27:28.120 --> 27:38.080]  the rules so this is about a facade media that has almost no viewers no listeners getting
[27:38.080 --> 27:43.240]  together and just creating the hoax the only power they have is that they are so lock stepped
[27:43.240 --> 27:47.320]  so they put out the exact same talking point even people don't trust mainstream media when
[27:47.320 --> 27:52.960]  they see it in 100 newspapers and 10 different networks all said the same way and they've
[27:52.960 --> 27:58.720]  got MSNBC CNN ABC NBC CBS going Bill Clinton never settled sexual assault cases Bill Clinton
[27:58.720 --> 28:03.000]  never even though he settled like four of them people start questioning kind of like
[28:03.000 --> 28:10.680]  there is no death panel on Obamacare it is free you can keep your doctor and then people
[28:10.680 --> 28:15.560]  started getting the fines the price went up you learned it was a screw job and then they
[28:15.560 --> 28:20.800]  were so arrogant grouper and others the architects would go on c-span and say thank God the public
[28:20.800 --> 28:26.920]  so dumb now they have celebrations on Charlie Rose's show saying thank God they're so dumb
[28:26.920 --> 28:32.160]  we told him you can keep your doctor and all the sick little lawyers in a club these young
[28:32.160 --> 28:38.160]  punk lawyers that help write it brag to Rose that they help screw the American people because
[28:38.160 --> 28:43.800]  they don't think you watch Charlie Rose see they want criminals want to celebrate the
[28:43.800 --> 28:50.240]  criminal action in their own criminal organization this criminology that's why there's all these
[28:50.240 --> 28:54.400]  videos of the head of the state department spokesperson you know saying ha ha ha thank
[28:54.400 --> 28:57.560]  God we're so corrupt they're so dumb that's why you see grouper saying and it's why you
[28:57.560 --> 29:02.000]  see these celebrations is because we played the videos last week is because they want
[29:02.000 --> 29:11.280]  to rub it into you remember the top wiki league from their top advisor to Hillary Mr. Ivy he
[29:11.280 --> 29:15.920]  says as I've mentioned we've all been quite content to demean government drop civics
[29:15.920 --> 29:20.560]  and in general conspired to produce unaware and compliant citizenry he writes he's serious
[29:20.560 --> 29:26.720]  he goes on the unawareness remains strong but compliance is obviously fading rapidly
[29:26.720 --> 29:30.840]  the problem demands some serious serious thinking and not just pull driven who want demographically
[29:30.840 --> 29:36.520]  inspired messaging that means race war and that's come out in the sorrows emails so now
[29:36.520 --> 29:41.520]  you understand they're sinking they're imploding their only move now is to try to steal the
[29:41.520 --> 29:49.960]  election and start all sorts of civil war class war in america a 1917 operation we're on the
[29:49.960 --> 30:01.240]  march the empires on the run alex jones and the gcn radio network hey it's another story
[30:01.240 --> 30:06.440]  by the lord of the flies hillary clinton hillary worried about jihad is entering with refugees
[30:06.440 --> 30:14.120]  in private speech we could have told you that in a private 2000 speech hillary clinton worried
[30:14.120 --> 30:18.240]  about the risk of jihad is entering jordan with legitimate refugees because they can't
[30:18.240 --> 30:22.120]  possibly fend all those refugees yeah we know you can't vet them all and yet you want to
[30:22.120 --> 30:29.040]  allow 55 000 syrians to come in annually unvetted but you're going to go to this private luncheon
[30:29.040 --> 30:34.720]  and tell them that it's probably a bad idea to take in refugees because of the fact there
[30:34.720 --> 30:38.760]  could be some extremists to get in there and then come over here to america and possibly
[30:38.760 --> 30:43.240]  chop off our heads we've been saying that since day one we need to secure the border we need
[30:43.240 --> 30:47.000]  someone like donald trump to come in here and make america great again because the clintons
[30:47.000 --> 30:51.360]  have done nothing but fell their entire political career and i'm sick and tired of it so november
[30:51.360 --> 30:55.760]  eight get your butt to the polls go out there vote make america great again let's secure

[31:10.000 --> 31:14.240]  something that i've been working on for a long time alex because i think it's very very
[31:14.240 --> 31:20.040]  important what the aging process is is when the cell replicates we lose a little bit of
[31:20.040 --> 31:24.960]  our telomeres telomeres are the little cups on the end of our chromosomes but when it
[31:24.960 --> 31:29.520]  runs out you start dying we chose the pqq because it has over a hundred and seventy five different
[31:29.520 --> 31:35.200]  clinical trials it's one of the most effective substances in the world it works like an antioxidant
[31:35.200 --> 31:41.240]  it works to repair nerve growth factor so this is a formula to deliver the maximum amount

[33:33.880 --> 33:41.680]  other patriots like dredgerport dot com right bark world net daily daily caller and others
[33:41.680 --> 33:53.000]  we have the president the vice president madame secretary clinton tim cane abc nbc cbs all
[33:53.000 --> 33:57.440]  of them so many videos coming in i can't even see half of them i was up late last night
[33:57.440 --> 34:02.280]  watching it come in this morning analyzing it we're getting hit by thousands of news
[34:02.280 --> 34:09.320]  articles every few hours we are being hit by multiple tv attacks every hour they even
[34:09.320 --> 34:15.760]  got c span guest on doing panels attacking us they are going 100 percent they rigged
[34:15.760 --> 34:24.520]  it with the republicans they had it they admit 15 months ago to leak this on to trump with
[34:24.520 --> 34:30.800]  his uh jock talk where he says the women are throwing themselves on you can even grab them
[34:30.800 --> 34:34.200]  that's not assault when the woman's on you and it's uncouth i don't like it he says he's
[34:34.200 --> 34:37.840]  grown but it shows that they don't have any history to blackmail him they've had to dig
[34:37.840 --> 34:47.720]  this up the point is hillary is a whole universe is worse and not magnitudes but you just it's
[34:47.720 --> 34:54.240]  indescribable they've got massive wiki leaks coming out now wiki leaks and i said this
[34:54.240 --> 34:59.080]  few days ago i said now i see they're genius it's exponential they go from once a month
[34:59.080 --> 35:06.080]  to once a week every three days every day now they're dropping every day 1200 more just
[35:06.080 --> 35:14.960]  hit today even more devastating and again that's why i'm sitting with my limited crew
[35:14.960 --> 35:18.240]  trying to go through these it's all just total criminality oh we're gonna keep them dumb we're
[35:18.240 --> 35:21.920]  gonna take what they got we're gonna get their guns we're gonna take over the media we're
[35:21.920 --> 35:26.680]  gonna cause civil war using muslims in europe and we'll have catholics and orthodox killing
[35:26.680 --> 35:30.240]  each other in ukraine and we'll have blacking against white the us turn up the rate you
[35:30.240 --> 35:35.960]  know i mean it is incredible i mean we have them you understand this is not our opinion
[35:35.960 --> 35:40.640]  that they say they're losing in their emails telling her fundraiser email she admits that
[35:40.640 --> 35:47.680]  trumps way ahead we've got to get roger stone on today to get his take on all the things
[35:47.680 --> 35:51.680]  that are unfolding because it's it's just amazing he's been so busy on what he says
[35:51.680 --> 35:57.520]  his other october surprises that i've not got his comment yet on danie williams i know
[35:57.520 --> 36:00.880]  he's aware of the case and covered it over the years but look at drugsreport.com if you're
[36:00.880 --> 36:05.480]  a tv viewer radio listeners can go there CNN orders blackout on clinton's son he'll be
[36:05.480 --> 36:10.400]  here in one hour i mean he's here he was just in here during a break earlier there he is
[36:10.400 --> 36:15.120]  standing right there at the television that i'm pointing at um and then of course we also
[36:15.120 --> 36:18.880]  tweeted a photo of he and i standing there just so folks know this is indeed going on
[36:18.880 --> 36:26.120]  and listen i interviewed his aunt i went back and checked the records in 1997 and danie was
[36:26.120 --> 36:30.920]  a young man then i mean he's only 30 something years old now i need to get his full bio and
[36:30.920 --> 36:34.560]  he was a little kid then i remember having her on then and they were never even wanting
[36:34.560 --> 36:39.440]  money or anything they just wanted him to recognize his son who bill gave seven hundred
[36:39.440 --> 36:45.560]  dollars to every month and who gave him christmas presents and stuff and who tried to climb
[36:45.560 --> 36:48.840]  the fence when he was a little kid and and and all the rest of it i mean this is this
[36:48.840 --> 36:54.560]  is an this is a epic story a greek tragedy and i believe danie when you find out the
[36:54.560 --> 36:59.920]  star climated a dna test and didn't so whether he's bill clinton's son or not i think he
[36:59.920 --> 37:04.080]  is he looks just like him they could have done a real dna test when bill clinton got
[37:04.080 --> 37:08.000]  asked about this a few weeks ago that video is coming up he looked extremely extremely
[37:08.000 --> 37:16.640]  guilty and did not want to talk and the campaign started flipping out so we know bill clinton
[37:16.640 --> 37:21.600]  frequented ladies of the night the oldest profession i'm not judging him i'll do what
[37:21.600 --> 37:27.920]  you gotta do and it won't be the first time elitist have had children on a wedlock but
[37:27.920 --> 37:31.280]  the decent ones take care of their children say what you want about jesse jackson he's
[37:31.280 --> 37:37.480]  got four or five turned out each those women was in a nice house being taken care of i thought
[37:37.480 --> 37:42.080]  people democrats that were there in 96 not just on air but off air and they've confirmed
[37:42.080 --> 37:46.720]  that jesse jackson would actually try to protect kids and young women and say watch out watch
[37:46.720 --> 37:51.120]  out when you got around bill clinton i mean that even jesse jackson who's got his problems
[37:51.120 --> 37:57.440]  is better than bill clinton and that's how again entitled these people are and hillary's
[37:57.440 --> 38:03.440]  even worse bill just wants to have sex with you or rape you if he has to hillary wants
[38:03.440 --> 38:06.800]  to rape the whole country the whole world so danie williams coming up and let's put out
[38:06.800 --> 38:09.920]  the tweet because the media says everything's conspiracy theory let's let's put the real
[38:09.920 --> 38:12.800]  ox jones tweet out we'll stick a photo of he and i together if we haven't put that out
[38:12.800 --> 38:18.200]  please tweet that out as well okay let me get into the latest developments here because
[38:18.200 --> 38:25.080]  they are they are massive trump has come out and said hillary wants world government unlimited
[38:25.080 --> 38:34.840]  immigration ruled by corporations that's why they're completely panicking
[38:34.840 --> 38:40.640]  so there it is we're going to get that video for you hillary wants world government unlimited
[38:40.640 --> 38:52.840]  immigration ruled by corporations isn't that just special so they can't stand it because
[38:52.840 --> 38:56.320]  she's in the emails wanting world government world governments now out in the open the
[38:56.320 --> 39:00.240]  pope's calling for it they wanted to deny they were building this thing the whole time
[39:00.240 --> 39:04.120]  now it's here now they're doing it now our credibility is giant and they want to say
[39:04.120 --> 39:08.680]  we're kooks because we're warning of a private corporate world government tpp and that's
[39:08.680 --> 39:18.680]  what's happening we have new biden audio sabotage is presidential aspirations biden aid sabotage
[39:18.680 --> 39:25.680]  is presidential aspirations surrogates plan to fool bitching bernie voters they sent in
[39:25.680 --> 39:30.960]  people as psychological operators to manipulate them clinton staffers discuss which emails
[39:30.960 --> 39:37.040]  to release new york times gave hillary veto power they now have leaks on hillary dealing
[39:37.040 --> 39:42.880]  with leaks years ago or hacks on hacks where hillary was directing the new york times okay
[39:42.880 --> 39:45.960]  we've got leaks we've got hacks you've got a report on it you've got to act like your
[39:45.960 --> 39:49.560]  journalist but here's what you're allowed to report on what you're not as i always told
[39:49.560 --> 39:55.600]  you with the leaks they only show the weak ones that's what they'll talk about is some
[39:55.600 --> 40:12.560]  little side issue when there is an incredible over the top mega massive bombshell information
[40:12.560 --> 40:30.000]  now before we continue any further let's start getting in to why they're freaking out so
[40:30.000 --> 40:34.640]  bad and why they want to claim it's such a defeat that we have bill clinton rape protesters
[40:34.640 --> 40:42.200]  popping up at every national event that hillary cane obama or clinton bill clinton do that's
[40:42.200 --> 40:47.360]  because it's devastating and then we've got during the same confrontations that happened
[40:47.360 --> 40:51.640]  yesterday three of them three of them at one event with all total three separate events
[40:51.640 --> 40:56.160]  that happened that so that's six disruptions they send people to go disrupt trump rally
[40:56.160 --> 41:00.320]  screaming racist that's not true we're here screaming rapist which is true you settled
[41:00.320 --> 41:08.400]  rape cases but first i want to play obama responds to alex jones sulfur comment which
[41:08.400 --> 41:11.560]  i covered earlier in the week and if you're a new viewer and like he's not responding
[41:11.560 --> 41:16.400]  to you cnn the associated press mother jones that they're all quite clear he's responding
[41:16.400 --> 41:25.320]  to the evil radio host alex jones they're just so afraid to ever actually say who we
[41:25.320 --> 41:29.480]  are so people come here and find out what we're saying they'll they'll say rush limbaugh's
[41:29.480 --> 41:34.120]  name they'll say shan hanity's name they won't say this one because it's so damning because
[41:34.120 --> 41:38.200]  i'll cross reference everything i'll show you the backgrounds of it i'm unfiltered i'm
[41:38.200 --> 41:41.720]  uncontrolled i'm not on a big network but i've built something bigger than what they've
[41:41.720 --> 41:48.000]  got that's what they can't stand there's not much else out there like that trudge that's
[41:48.000 --> 41:54.120]  why they're trying to shut down the free internet that's why they're bringing in all these regulations
[41:54.120 --> 41:57.360]  that admitting they want to shut it down first they didn't want to shut down free speech now
[41:57.360 --> 42:01.760]  they admit it first they didn't want to double taxi with obama care now they admit it first
[42:01.760 --> 42:07.320]  they're warden death panels now there is first they weren't coming out your guns now they
[42:07.320 --> 42:14.640]  admit they want to ban them and that's in the wiki leaks but hell that's in the newspapers
[42:14.640 --> 42:18.680]  so they're in a lot of trouble because first the nsa wasn't spying on you now it is because
[42:18.680 --> 42:24.440]  it always was so he makes this joke about me saying he's got flies landing on him which
[42:24.440 --> 42:30.280]  biblically is associated with the underworld with satanism with corruption but all i'm
[42:30.280 --> 42:35.880]  saying is it's an art type the actions of obama and hillary are war and death and corruption
[42:35.880 --> 42:40.280]  and poverty and wanting to make us poor so they can control us that's an aspect of evil
[42:40.280 --> 42:42.400]  they don't want prosperity let's go to that clip
[42:42.400 --> 42:49.600]  they demonize each other and i mean that literally by the way i was reading the other
[42:49.600 --> 42:56.000]  day there's a guy on the radio who apparently trumps on his show frequently he said me and
[42:56.000 --> 43:18.240]  hillary are demons said we smell like sulfur ain't that something now i mean come on people
[43:18.240 --> 43:22.040]  you know did you pick up on that bill clinton's so good at that yesterday he's like listen
[43:22.040 --> 43:26.360]  i can tell you these red necks are racist trumps got bad people that are out to get
[43:26.360 --> 43:35.520]  you i used to be one okay i used to be a red no you were a dixie mafia son of the mafia
[43:35.520 --> 43:39.640]  brought in to dominate the poor white people black people and others of arkansas you did
[43:39.640 --> 43:43.120]  such a good job of the cia they put you in charge of the whole country what you are as
[43:43.120 --> 43:48.520]  a predator bill clinton and you're showing race baiting that's the latest clip we've
[43:48.520 --> 43:54.880]  got but rachel madel went crazy last night dealing with all of this and trying to misrepresent
[43:54.880 --> 44:00.240]  what we're saying and what we're doing so let's go ahead and play this report a new
[44:00.240 --> 44:05.080]  phenomenon that you may have noticed at recent democratic rallies we first saw it in las
[44:05.080 --> 44:09.840]  vegas thursday night tim cane was interrupted by a protester who was wearing a shirt that
[44:09.840 --> 44:16.240]  said rape on it and the guy yelled out bill clinton is a rapist that first happened thursday
[44:16.240 --> 44:20.960]  night then we saw it happen multiple times at multiple clinton events today including
[44:20.960 --> 44:25.120]  one where the featured speaker was president obama and one where the featured speaker
[44:25.120 --> 44:55.080]  was bill clinton himself here is the problem bill clinton is a rapist in my wars dot com
[44:55.080 --> 45:16.360]  there's a guy on the radio who apparently trumps on his show frequently he said me and
[45:16.360 --> 45:29.960]  hillary are demons said we smell like sulfur there's a guy on the radio the guy on the
[45:29.960 --> 45:34.960]  radio is alex jones who runs the info wars conspiracy theory website and internet radio
[45:34.960 --> 45:40.480]  show and in fact he does call president obama and hillary clinton demons he says they smell
[45:40.480 --> 45:45.800]  like sulfur he says it has he has it on good authority that they are in fact literally
[45:45.800 --> 45:53.080]  possessed by demons he is an abject psychopathic demon from hell that as soon as he gets into
[45:53.080 --> 45:57.080]  powers and try to destroy the planet i'm sure of that and people around her say she's so
[45:57.080 --> 46:03.360]  dark now and so evil and so possessed that they are having nightmares they're freaking
[46:03.360 --> 46:08.000]  out folks let me just taste it but if the media wants to go with this that's fine there
[46:08.000 --> 46:14.400]  are dozens of videos and photos of obama having flies land on him indoors at all times of
[46:14.400 --> 46:19.680]  year and he'll be next to a hundred people and no one has flies on hillary reportedly
[46:19.680 --> 46:25.440]  i mean i was told people around her that they think she's demon possessed okay i'm just
[46:25.440 --> 46:32.640]  gonna go ahead and say it okay all right ready to connect the dots the guy who says he has
[46:32.640 --> 46:38.200]  it on good authority that president obama and hillary clinton are literally demons he's
[46:38.200 --> 46:42.680]  the reason we're getting the people screaming rape at all the clinton events now because
[46:42.680 --> 46:49.720]  he and his conspiracy theory demon possession website they are now in in support of the

[48:00.880 --> 48:05.680]  panic and force a public takeover of homeland security of elections because i knew it was

[55:08.000 --> 55:11.360]  before that they were on tv making fun of people about something else the week before
[55:11.360 --> 55:19.280]  that they do victory laps on c-span and on pbs where they think it's a more intellectual
[55:19.280 --> 55:27.000]  audience about how they're conning everyone i mean do you understand folks these people
[55:27.000 --> 55:34.640]  are literally mentally ill in my view because they think they're the only ones that are

[55:38.800 --> 55:42.440]  globals try to hire me so many times we've talked about it and they tell you you're smart

[59:54.360 --> 01:00:21.480]  jones show john adams signer of the declaration of independence and the second president of the
[01:00:21.480 --> 01:00:28.840]  united states told the military in a speech made in 1798 our constitution was made only for a moral
[01:00:28.840 --> 01:00:34.760]  and religious people it is wholly inadequate to the government of any other and it was prussian
[01:00:34.760 --> 01:00:40.920]  statesman auto von bizmark shaking his fist at the united states who said there is a providence
[01:00:40.920 --> 01:00:48.840]  that protects idiots drunkards children and the united states of america and that protection was
[01:00:48.840 --> 01:00:54.360]  on full display at the second presidential debate with all of the new world order's media and all
[01:00:54.360 --> 01:01:00.280]  of the new world order cia operatives they just couldn't put humpty dumpty hillary back together
[01:01:00.280 --> 01:01:07.240]  again isn't it ironic that the roughly 28 million people watching the second presidential debate
[01:01:07.240 --> 01:01:14.040]  witnessed in live time the crushing weight of american providence in action the symbolism was
[01:01:14.040 --> 01:01:20.280]  palatable just as obama had been plagued by flies as his two-faced politics took the reins of power
[01:01:20.280 --> 01:01:29.800]  of the nation uh this guy's bothered me here of uh our sorry sorry i'm gonna start over i'm gonna
[01:01:29.800 --> 01:01:37.240]  start at eye will contrast hey bls above lord of the flies made yet another appearance clinging
[01:01:37.240 --> 01:01:44.280]  to hillary's evil glowing radiance first let me start by saying that so much of what he's just
[01:01:44.280 --> 01:01:49.720]  said is not right but he gets to run his campaign anyway he chooses he gets to decide what he wants
[01:01:49.720 --> 01:01:55.880]  to talk about and in one of the strangest presidential debates in american history a former president
[01:01:55.880 --> 01:02:02.760]  meekly sat on the sidelines faced with three of the women he raped meanwhile hillary in true
[01:02:02.760 --> 01:02:09.720]  arrogant aplomb railed on donald trump about a joke he made 11 years ago and he has said that
[01:02:09.720 --> 01:02:17.480]  the video doesn't represent who he is but i think it's clear to anyone who heard it that it
[01:02:17.480 --> 01:02:24.120]  represents exactly who he is because we've seen this throughout the campaign we have seen him
[01:02:24.120 --> 01:02:33.480]  insult women we've seen him rape women on their appearance ranking them from one to ten then
[01:02:33.480 --> 01:02:40.280]  providence struck you can say any way you want to say it but bill clinton was abusive to women
[01:02:40.280 --> 01:02:46.360]  hillary clinton attacked those same women and attacked them viciously four of them here tonight
[01:02:46.360 --> 01:02:55.000]  one of the women who is a wonderful woman at 12 years old was raped at 12 her client
[01:02:55.720 --> 01:03:00.920]  she represented got him off and she's seen laughing on two separate occasions laughing at the girl
[01:03:00.920 --> 01:03:09.080]  who was raped kathy shelton that young woman is here with us tonight so don't tell me about words
[01:03:09.080 --> 01:03:16.280]  i am absolutely i apologize for those words what president clinton did he was impeached he lost his
[01:03:16.280 --> 01:03:25.000]  license to practice law he had to pay an 850 000 dollar fine to one of the women pola jones who's
[01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:31.880]  also here tonight and i will tell you that when hillary brings up a point like that and she talks
[01:03:31.880 --> 01:03:38.360]  about words that i said 11 years ago i think it's disgraceful and i think she should be ashamed of
[01:03:38.360 --> 01:03:47.640]  herself if you want to know the truth can we please hold the applause bill hillary obama the cia
[01:03:47.640 --> 01:03:55.160]  united nations new world order the sleeping giant is awake and it just had you for breakfast she got
[01:03:55.160 --> 01:04:00.120]  caught in a total lie her papers went out to all her friends at the banks goldman sacks and everybody
[01:04:00.120 --> 01:04:07.320]  else and she said things wiki leaks that just came out and falling down on my mother was blaming
[01:04:07.320 --> 01:04:14.040]  the lie on the late great abraham lakin that's one that i have but when you talk about apology
[01:04:14.760 --> 01:04:18.440]  i think the one that you should really be apologizing for and the thing that you should
[01:04:18.440 --> 01:04:26.920]  be apologizing for are the 33 000 emails that you deleted and that you acid washed and then the two
[01:04:26.920 --> 01:04:32.520]  boxes of emails and other things last week that were taken from an office and are now missing
[01:04:33.160 --> 01:04:37.240]  so we're going to get a special prosecutor and we're going to look into it because you know what

[01:08:25.640 --> 01:08:32.120]  who understands that democracy in a big diverse country doesn't work if you constantly demonize
[01:08:32.120 --> 01:08:38.440]  each other demonize each other you could put half of trump supporters into what i call the basket
[01:08:38.440 --> 01:08:43.880]  of deplorables and i mean that literally by the way there i was i was reading the other day there
[01:08:43.880 --> 01:08:49.960]  there's a guy on the radio who apparently trumps on his show frequently he said me and hillary are
[01:08:49.960 --> 01:09:00.840]  demons i'm telling you she is a demon this is biblical she's going to launch a nuclear war
[01:09:00.840 --> 01:09:09.320]  i said we smell like something
[01:09:18.360 --> 01:09:21.080]  i mean come on people
[01:09:23.320 --> 01:09:27.640]  you can't watch that you a lot i'm not kidding people say they say
[01:09:27.640 --> 01:09:33.640]  of the folks i've been told this by high up folks they say listen obama and hillary both
[01:09:33.640 --> 01:09:37.960]  smell like sulfur i never said this because the media go crazy with but i've talked people that
[01:09:37.960 --> 01:09:44.360]  are in protective details i mean they're scared up and they say listen she's a freaking demon and
[01:09:44.360 --> 01:09:53.160]  she stinks and so does obama i go like what sulfur they smell like hell on november 8th the arrogance
[01:09:53.160 --> 01:10:00.680]  of washington dc will come face to face with the righteous verdict of the american voter it's about
[01:10:00.680 --> 01:10:06.520]  time look at this crowd so much of what he's just said is not right but he gets to run his campaign
[01:10:06.520 --> 01:10:14.360]  anyway he chooses so much of what he says isn't true in the damn fly lands right on her eyeball
[01:10:14.360 --> 01:10:26.200]  oh there that's amazing i believe danie williams story i interviewed his aunt i remember talking
[01:10:26.200 --> 01:10:30.280]  about it covered i went back and did some research and found references to it i don't remember
[01:10:30.840 --> 01:10:36.760]  his aunt the church lady hard-working lady that raised him back when he was like ten years old
[01:10:36.760 --> 01:10:41.800]  the time and because the media spent on this oh there's some guy from arkansas claiming he's
[01:10:41.800 --> 01:10:48.040]  bill clinton's little bunch of kid there's a dirty trick dirty trick they spent him trying to climb
[01:10:48.040 --> 01:10:53.560]  the fence when he's a little kid to see his daddy clinton didn't do a dna test like he said he did
[01:10:53.560 --> 01:10:58.280]  that was all fake we looked into it it was a tabloid owned by the clinton's friends
[01:11:00.200 --> 01:11:05.000]  that's all coming up but this is just about how evil these people are and how fake they're that's
[01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:14.360]  why we're covering this today so info wars.com exclusive danie williams the reported son of bill
[01:11:14.360 --> 01:11:21.880]  clinton in studio and we've not really done any pre-preparation either i know he sent me facebook
[01:11:21.880 --> 01:11:27.640]  and twitter deals over the years and he's talked to bigs he likes bigs a lot they've talked and
[01:11:27.640 --> 01:11:31.640]  this was going to be in a couple other big publications but at the end of the day danie
[01:11:31.640 --> 01:11:35.000]  said he likes when alex jones put the sound i didn't even ask for it it's crazy i didn't even
[01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:38.600]  ask to have the exclusive then we just got it because i guess danie's followed the show some
[01:11:38.600 --> 01:11:45.320]  over the years so that's what this comes down to is everything that clinton's tell you is a lie
[01:11:45.880 --> 01:11:50.280]  and we've got big news articles out in the daily mail are these the clinton's secret grandkids
[01:11:50.280 --> 01:11:55.880]  their father the man who claims he's bill clinton's love child says his prostitute mother slept with
[01:11:55.880 --> 01:12:00.840]  the former arkansas governor 13 times and received 700 dollar bills every month delivered
[01:12:00.840 --> 01:12:07.880]  by state trooper i remember that back of the 90s covering it all i know is i got beat up in a parking
[01:12:07.880 --> 01:12:12.440]  lot saying shut up about the clinton's and then lost my job after i've had people on about it
[01:12:14.120 --> 01:12:18.280]  and i never knew exactly what it was with the clinton's they wouldn't say they just said stop
[01:12:18.280 --> 01:12:21.560]  talking about the clinton's i could get death threats on my cell phone death threats at my
[01:12:21.560 --> 01:12:25.480]  office phone one day i'm on the office phone we're gonna kill you outside you don't shut my
[01:12:25.480 --> 01:12:30.920]  clothes i'm like oh go to hell i walk outside and walk around my car and they go we told you boom
[01:12:30.920 --> 01:12:37.720]  broke my nose i was like oh wow you really mean business of course old crocodile brain shifted
[01:12:37.720 --> 01:12:45.080]  into gear and uh i'm not the toughest guy around but four guys attacking in the parking lot i beat
[01:12:45.080 --> 01:12:49.400]  the living hell out of them they they were they were barely getting in their astro van when i was
[01:12:49.400 --> 01:12:53.480]  done with them but that's the side i'm not trying to act tough i'm not tough unless four guys trying
[01:12:53.480 --> 01:12:59.000]  to kill me in the parking lot i beat the living hell out of them but this is the type of stuff
[01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:03.400]  i've dealt with in my life i mean i i got i got hit too but it could even hurt me it's like i'm
[01:13:03.400 --> 01:13:08.040]  blood spurtin out there big deal i'm about to tear your face off all right i'm flashing back to it i
[01:13:08.040 --> 01:13:14.600]  apologize i'm not into violence but when somebody attacks you and breaks your nose and you punch
[01:13:14.600 --> 01:13:19.480]  them in their nose rips off their face i mean i mean the cartilage came out nose is like hanging
[01:13:19.480 --> 01:13:24.840]  it's just like victory they hit the ground boom it's like i'm standing blood spraying let's go
[01:13:26.840 --> 01:13:31.320]  just like we do in the info war ladies and gentlemen we're not bragging it's no brag if it's
[01:13:31.320 --> 01:13:37.080]  fact all right excuse me see i gotta get hyped up to do this though this isn't fun when i see some
[01:13:37.080 --> 01:13:41.000]  new video of hillary confronted by bill clinton's a rapist it's all of the news and the president
[01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:48.040]  attacks me yesterday you know i'm doing my duty and it's scary it's dangerous and so my animal
[01:13:48.040 --> 01:13:54.200]  instinct kicks in and starts liking it just because i guess that's the comforter for doing
[01:13:54.200 --> 01:13:59.000]  this type of stuff but so i apologize for being such an animal but that's the stuff that gets me
[01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:05.800]  through that's why god made me to be a crazy animal i mean i've got intellectual tools some of the
[01:14:05.800 --> 01:14:11.560]  best but i am at the end of the day a crazy caveman and uh i feel good putting dany williams
[01:14:11.560 --> 01:14:16.200]  on the air i feel good exposing these people i feel good standing up for the christians the
[01:14:16.200 --> 01:14:22.280]  200 000 plus murdered in syria alone and they the country was 20 christian and
[01:14:24.680 --> 01:14:29.320]  obama gets up and i want to find that clip where he goes people say we gotta let christians in no
[01:14:29.320 --> 01:14:33.800]  no no we're we're we're gonna be fair we let everybody in he laughs because he knows there's
[01:14:33.800 --> 01:14:47.960]  an embargo they let 0.4 christians in every couple thousand jihadis they let 0.4 in think about that
[01:14:48.520 --> 01:14:51.720]  same thing in europe they're not letting the christians out there murdering them and you ask
[01:14:51.720 --> 01:14:56.840]  why are they out to kill christians because hillary clinton and obama are public and they're also
[01:14:56.840 --> 01:15:04.600]  on their emails hating christians hating america hating jesus christ because america for all its
[01:15:04.600 --> 01:15:13.720]  evils and all its problems was a christian nation was given providence by true christians that even
[01:15:13.720 --> 01:15:19.480]  predated the official church who were always there and they believed they were going to build a new
[01:15:19.480 --> 01:15:29.480]  continent now the globalists have put out a bunch of false prophecies and false info saying america
[01:15:29.480 --> 01:15:34.280]  won't even exist during the great tribulation so you don't understand america will be the the
[01:15:34.280 --> 01:15:38.840]  decider of what happens in the great tribulation they tell you it doesn't exist in scripture
[01:15:40.120 --> 01:15:43.480]  because globalists have infiltrated the church and then when you know america will decide the
[01:15:43.480 --> 01:15:47.720]  future fate because god gives us free will but i'm not going to get into all that right now ladies
[01:15:47.720 --> 01:15:55.080]  and gentlemen the point you need to understand is bill clinton and hillary don't like being called
[01:15:55.080 --> 01:16:02.200]  demons and i figured it out they're all competing to be the anti christ and that's an insult that's
[01:16:02.200 --> 01:16:08.520]  like calling them a dishwasher so let me call you this anti christ spirits to make you happier you
[01:16:08.520 --> 01:16:14.920]  are aspiring to the anti christ world government you are openly establishing world government
[01:16:14.920 --> 01:16:19.560]  that's anti human anti prosperity that's genetically engineering and mutating all major
[01:16:19.560 --> 01:16:26.120]  species you are the very ark type of the bible's warning of he that comes to kill steal and destroy
[01:16:26.120 --> 01:16:37.560]  and overthrow god's creation so i apologize for calling you demons you are aspiring empty souls
[01:16:37.560 --> 01:16:46.360]  begging for satan to enter you if that's better i apologize you've been given your full title satan
[01:16:46.360 --> 01:16:52.760]  has a large closet with a lot of clothes hanging a lot of a lot of empty souls a lot of empty vessels
[01:16:53.400 --> 01:17:02.040]  and you're all there clamoring to be to be fitted with his spirit you're all there like avatar wanting
[01:17:02.040 --> 01:17:08.200]  him to jump into your body and so i get why it made you so mad i apologize that's right you're not
[01:17:08.200 --> 01:17:14.280]  demons you wouldn't be controlled by a demon you are aspiring to the lucifer spirit i got
[01:17:14.280 --> 01:17:21.000]  involved in your religion i understand i what do i know i apologize to you profusely obviously
[01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:24.520]  that's why you get so upset about it because believe me it's not because it's discrediting
[01:17:24.520 --> 01:17:28.600]  we're talking about it they want to go don't go there don't go there oh that discredits him
[01:17:28.600 --> 01:17:35.880]  oh boy trump don't go there because you know it will destroy you you know we carry the intelligence
[01:17:35.880 --> 01:17:43.720]  that will take you down you know it you hate it you can't stand against it
[01:17:45.640 --> 01:17:49.960]  as long as those of us that know the truth are willing to do anything legal and lawful
[01:17:50.840 --> 01:17:55.640]  to stand against you as long as we set ourselves against you set our wills against you set our
[01:17:55.640 --> 01:18:00.920]  spirits against you it's a spiritual war folks god will then back us up but we have to go through
[01:18:00.920 --> 01:18:07.800]  the tribulation and believe me it is intense but it every day you wake up and you're only stronger
[01:18:07.800 --> 01:18:16.520]  after it but the trial of fire i know a lot of people don't want to be spiritual and love god
[01:18:16.520 --> 01:18:20.760]  because when you love god the enemy comes against you and the trials are substantive
[01:18:20.760 --> 01:18:25.560]  but for me the trials
[01:18:29.400 --> 01:18:34.200]  are like coming up for air out of the ocean it's the struggle of birth
[01:18:37.240 --> 01:18:43.640]  and it's the birth of the fall of satan the final fall all right i've already waxed
[01:18:43.640 --> 01:18:46.840]  poetic here today i'm gonna skip this network right because of the epic nature of the transmission
[01:18:46.840 --> 01:18:52.040]  uh we're engaged in here today um the the wiki leaks are out there it's more of the same running
[01:18:52.040 --> 01:18:58.520]  the media colluding engaged in crime selling us secrets one one of these is like life in person
[01:18:58.520 --> 01:19:03.720]  just total absolute criminal activity america's been shown the total evil of our government
[01:19:03.720 --> 01:19:08.680]  that's been hijacked by criminals before we're judged and you cannot believe in god the point is
[01:19:08.680 --> 01:19:19.320]  humans through group movements manifest a style a spirit you've got classical architecture you've
[01:19:19.320 --> 01:19:24.840]  got victorian architecture you've got classical american architecture you've got cubism you've
[01:19:24.840 --> 01:19:29.480]  got all this stuff you know it's the spirit of our age and you have to decide which spirit you're with
[01:19:32.200 --> 01:19:36.680]  and that's why i get into spiritualism because they're so scared because that's what they're
[01:19:36.680 --> 01:19:41.720]  obsessed with it comes out in the news the clinton's obama all of them frank swamina ron
[01:19:41.720 --> 01:19:47.880]  tony blair the current british prime minister they're all completely obsessed with the occult
[01:19:47.880 --> 01:19:52.680]  it's sculling bones but he me grow and they laugh oh alex jones is calling us out as the devil
[01:19:53.640 --> 01:19:56.440]  says we're under plagues says we're under flies
[01:19:56.440 --> 01:20:04.280]  oh god god boy keep doing that you're gonna make us win alex
[01:20:07.240 --> 01:20:09.960]  whatever you do though throw me in that briar patch
[01:20:14.360 --> 01:20:19.400]  now i got a lot of the clips here i want to play briefly let me just fund this operation right now

[01:21:08.840 --> 01:21:12.200]  you but we don't want to be targeted so don't don't say where you get the stuff made or where it gets
[01:21:12.200 --> 01:21:17.320]  manufactured dr group makes about 45 percent of our products the others are made by the other two
[01:21:17.320 --> 01:21:21.160]  big organic top rated companies because i know i'm a political target plus i want to sell high

[01:21:26.840 --> 01:21:32.600]  but the average supplement company has five to seven times markup let's say there's five
[01:21:32.600 --> 01:21:37.000]  dollars counting the cost of the bottle in the product they sell it for 30 40 if we're selling
[01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:42.040]  something for a hundred dollars there's like 50 dollars in product in it if we're selling something
[01:21:42.040 --> 01:21:49.800]  for 1995 there's ten dollars a product in it and people go why don't you sell a bottle of
[01:21:49.800 --> 01:21:54.680]  melatonin for 1995 that's industry standard you have a prettier bottle and better better marketing
[01:21:55.800 --> 01:22:01.880]  then i go but i want el tryptophan i want valerian root i want the organic melatonin and
[01:22:01.880 --> 01:22:07.800]  seven other ingredients and i want to sell it for the same price as just a bottle of melatonin of
[01:22:07.800 --> 01:22:13.640]  the same dose and then i'm gonna put my own name for it knock out because when i get all fired up
[01:22:13.640 --> 01:22:17.480]  and i'm going on too many cylinders and my problem isn't too few cylinders

[01:24:47.400 --> 01:24:54.120]  confused the crew i said get ready the the clips of um trump but first let's play cnn panelists
[01:24:54.120 --> 01:24:58.840]  bill clinton rape allegations are effing ridiculous dude this is cnn panelists um
[01:24:59.960 --> 01:25:03.800]  documented history of sexual abuse against so cnn panelists just miss bill clinton's
[01:25:03.800 --> 01:25:07.400]  documented history of sexual abuse against women as effing ridiculous dude because they've been
[01:25:07.400 --> 01:25:13.960]  ordered to do this and act all angry by the head of it on broadcast uh of erin bernett as the networks
[01:25:13.960 --> 01:25:19.720]  continue to cover for the clinton's wall devouring vast swaths of airtime to trump locker room banter
[01:25:19.720 --> 01:25:24.520]  and they want to say he's this big rapist tried to rape a woman by saying women jump on you they
[01:25:24.520 --> 01:25:29.320]  let you grab them to to rape when bill clinton settled rape the commas were made by liberal cnn
[01:25:29.320 --> 01:25:35.800]  commentator angela ray who went absolutely crazy there's the other cnn reporter yelling the word
[01:25:35.800 --> 01:25:41.720]  pussycat without the cat on the end over and over and over again they're meant to have this fake
[01:25:41.720 --> 01:25:49.080]  outburst because the head of cnn drudge has this exclusive has ordered danie williams not to be
[01:25:49.080 --> 01:25:54.680]  covered and i've talked to the reporters who've been told you don't mention her health you don't
[01:25:54.680 --> 01:25:59.320]  mention bill clinton and sexual assault stuff and now it's you don't mention danie williams that's
[01:25:59.320 --> 01:26:04.600]  jeff zucker well listen jeff i know you and clinton and obama and everybody are working as hard as you
[01:26:04.600 --> 01:26:12.520]  can uh right now and doing everything you can like gangbusters right now i'm trying to shut down
[01:26:12.520 --> 01:26:16.840]  the new alt media that you want to call right wing so the left gets into ending free speech now they
[01:26:16.840 --> 01:26:20.920]  went into free speech worldwide of everybody it's not working but at your average show is 100
[01:26:20.920 --> 01:26:27.240]  thousand viewers your biggest one's a million bro i've got reporters that get 20 million views
[01:26:27.240 --> 01:26:33.160]  awake on their youtube and that isn't like every once in a while the average is like for watching
[01:26:33.160 --> 01:26:41.560]  about 10 million a week i mean what's it gonna do when we come for you bad boys but they're still
[01:26:41.560 --> 01:26:45.240]  arrogant they're showing their average towers they still have secretaries kissing their asses
[01:26:45.240 --> 01:26:49.560]  except the secretary is going to get us the intel out the trash can and mail it to us see
[01:26:51.320 --> 01:26:55.640]  it's happening it's going down so let's play her flip it out here it is
[01:26:56.840 --> 01:27:02.440]  well i'm sorry the fact of the matter is bill clinton is not running for president of these
[01:27:02.440 --> 01:27:09.800]  united states i'm not going to i'm not going to let you all continue to say that she allowed him
[01:27:09.800 --> 01:27:15.800]  to wait no she didn't and she how does she facilitate what she was she was she was
[01:27:15.800 --> 01:27:19.720]  down come down no no no no because it's not that that's red culture can't let you're blaming
[01:27:19.720 --> 01:27:24.520]  someone who's succumbed to you someone committed a guilty on her so you love christian so let's
[01:27:24.520 --> 01:27:28.760]  talk about what that is she was accused of facilitating it last night and she was definitely
[01:27:28.760 --> 01:27:34.920]  silent she did not deny it but you know why because it's f being ridiculous so ridiculous that's
[01:27:34.920 --> 01:27:39.880]  crazy all you have to do is play a video i can't believe y'all i'm the famous rapist so they call
[01:27:39.880 --> 01:27:44.440]  $2,500 of another victim and that's what you all are going to be proud of be proud of you bring
[01:27:44.440 --> 01:27:49.000]  in paris and margaret victims give me a break margaret look i mean selective memory and choosing
[01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:52.760]  would you i mean there are there are depositions also against donald trump and accuse him of rape
[01:27:52.760 --> 01:27:56.600]  let's be very clear my case was this mess you know what regardless of what it was just mixed
[01:27:56.600 --> 01:28:00.200]  they're under oath and they're there kaley so let's not be totally selective let's also just
[01:28:00.200 --> 01:28:03.800]  talk about the role of women here because you know what those women were great and they were fans of
[01:28:03.800 --> 01:28:07.480]  donald trump they were also at a donald trump rally this is no longer about women that are at
[01:28:07.480 --> 01:28:13.480]  donald trump's rallies this is about independent women republican women guess what 70% of republican
[01:28:13.480 --> 01:28:19.240]  women back in august we're going to vote for donald trump to mit romney's 93% of republican
[01:28:19.240 --> 01:28:25.320]  women and john mccain's 89% of republican women that was august that was not now these numbers
[01:28:25.320 --> 01:28:29.880]  are bleeding for donald trump and so it doesn't matter what his fans say it matters about these
[01:28:29.880 --> 01:28:34.920]  women in these swing states and where they're going and you're not going to that point so that's
[01:28:34.920 --> 01:28:39.160]  all about your height trump's losing trumps over it's over for trump it's over for trump
[01:28:39.160 --> 01:28:44.280]  over and over again this is how they push this narrative freak out but cnn is a husk of itself
[01:28:44.280 --> 01:28:49.240]  trying to sell a con that obama cares free you can keep your doctor god thank god they're so stupid
[01:28:49.240 --> 01:28:55.000]  over and over again speaking of who needs some uh obama care here's hillary and the new trump
[01:28:55.000 --> 01:29:01.320]  ad that devastates her that i hope everybody gets an info wars dot com and shares our next

[01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:21.160]  as secretary of state now she wants to be president hillary clinton doesn't have the fortitude strength
[01:29:21.160 --> 01:29:27.000]  or stamina to lead in our world she failed as secretary of state don't let her fail us again
[01:29:27.560 --> 01:29:31.320]  now i want to correct the trump campaign and obviously they they know this but she
[01:29:31.320 --> 01:29:36.120]  they wanted to make the middle east of fell state north africa they wanted to topple it to come out
[01:29:36.120 --> 01:29:40.920]  libya as libya was stabilizing all of africa and actually helping people so that's why she did that

[01:33:12.760 --> 01:33:20.120]  election 2016 americanism versus globalism you're listening to the alich jones show
[01:33:20.120 --> 01:33:26.520]  broadcasting from austin texas worldwide
[01:33:27.880 --> 01:33:33.000]  while the media distracted you with an 11 year old tape of donald trump's locker room banter
[01:33:33.000 --> 01:33:39.160]  wiki leaks dropped bombshell after bombshell and the clinton mouthpiece media have barely even
[01:33:39.160 --> 01:33:44.680]  reported on it in one email sent by hillary surrogate bill ivy to clinton campaign manager
[01:33:44.680 --> 01:33:50.520]  john pedestrian ivy brags about how the left has sought to maintain political power by producing
[01:33:50.520 --> 01:33:57.640]  quote an unaware and compliant citizenry this is beyond arrogant elitism it sounds like something
[01:33:57.640 --> 01:34:05.240]  out of they live the games have been substantial both for ourselves and for you the human power
[01:34:05.240 --> 01:34:12.440]  elite we've all been quite content to demean government drop civics and in general conspire
[01:34:12.440 --> 01:34:19.560]  to produce an unaware and compliant citizenry conspire conspire to produce an uninformed mass
[01:34:19.560 --> 01:34:24.920]  who will just do as they're told the unawareness remains strong but compliance is obviously fading
[01:34:24.920 --> 01:34:30.600]  rapidly this problem demands some serious serious thinking and not just poll driven demographically
[01:34:30.600 --> 01:34:37.080]  inspired messaging to emphasize ivy admits that the left has conspired to produce an unaware and
[01:34:37.080 --> 01:34:43.400]  compliant citizenry but that they're not as easy to manipulate anymore and that this is a problem
[01:34:43.400 --> 01:34:49.960]  he characterizes unawareness amongst the public as a positive thing for the clinton campaign so
[01:34:49.960 --> 01:34:56.840]  we're supposed to be outraged about trumps locker room banter from 2005 yet here we have a clinton
[01:34:56.840 --> 01:35:03.800]  surrogate calling the entire population of america dumb and conspiring with the clinton campaign
[01:35:03.800 --> 01:35:09.000]  to keep it that way and there's no outrage whatsoever there's not even any media coverage of
[01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:15.480]  it absolutely nothing but are you really surprised given what the other wiki leaks emails reveal
[01:35:15.480 --> 01:35:21.400]  about the level of collusion between the cocked media and team hillary they talk about their
[01:35:21.400 --> 01:35:27.400]  friendlies in the media who will blindly regurgitate their talking points reporters like cmbc's john
[01:35:27.400 --> 01:35:33.000]  harwood emailing the clinton campaign begging to be patterned on the head like an obedient dog
[01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:38.760]  for lavishing praise on hillary the new york times asking the clinton campaign for permission to use
[01:35:38.760 --> 01:35:44.600]  quotes from their own interview with hillary the boston globe colluding with her campaign to give
[01:35:44.600 --> 01:35:51.080]  her quote a big presence this level of cronyism and corruption is staggering but it explains why
[01:35:51.080 --> 01:35:57.640]  much of the media refuses to even cover the wiki leaks releases things like hillary openly admitting
[01:35:57.640 --> 01:36:04.360]  that our so-called allies katar and saudi arabia are funding and supporting isis oh but trump said
[01:36:04.360 --> 01:36:09.800]  the word posse in 2005 so i guess that's more important confirmation that hillary deliberately
[01:36:09.800 --> 01:36:15.640]  and criminally deleted certain emails to hide evidence of her wrongdoing moles inside bernie
[01:36:15.640 --> 01:36:21.320]  sanders campaign who betrayed his strategy to tip off hillary bill clinton's behavior pushing a female
[01:36:21.320 --> 01:36:28.120]  clinton foundation staffer to near suicide insiders within hillary's campaign petrified about the
[01:36:28.120 --> 01:36:34.200]  damage posed by bill clinton's sexual predatory past oh but you didn't hear about any of this on
[01:36:34.200 --> 01:36:42.360]  cnn but you did hear donald trump say the word posse in 2005 and to the media that's what matters
[01:36:42.360 --> 01:36:50.920]  and they wonder why their readership is collapsing they wonder why 94 percent of the american people
[01:36:50.920 --> 01:37:04.280]  no longer trust a thing they say
[01:37:09.160 --> 01:37:14.600]  i mean he is an abject psychopathic demon from hell that as soon as he gets into powers and
[01:37:14.600 --> 01:37:20.520]  try to destroy the planet he's worked like a demon as you know it's like a third state and we came we
[01:37:20.520 --> 01:37:29.560]  saw he died what's difference at this point does it make and there's only one candidate in this race
[01:37:29.560 --> 01:37:36.040]  who understands that democracy in a big diverse country doesn't work if you constantly demonize
[01:37:36.040 --> 01:37:42.440]  each other demonize each other you could put half of trump's supporters into what i call the basket
[01:37:42.440 --> 01:37:48.120]  of deplorables and i mean that literally by the way there i was i was reading the other day there's
[01:37:48.120 --> 01:37:55.160]  a guy on the radio who apparently comes on a show frequently he said me and hillary are demons i'm
[01:37:55.160 --> 01:38:07.160]  telling you she is a demon this is biblical she's going to launch a nuclear war said we
[01:38:07.160 --> 01:38:15.000]  smell like sulfur ain't that something
[01:38:18.520 --> 01:38:19.000]  now
[01:38:22.440 --> 01:38:25.000]  i mean come on people
[01:38:27.240 --> 01:38:34.440]  you can't watch that evil off i'm not kidding people say they say that folks i've been told this
[01:38:34.440 --> 01:38:39.880]  by high up folks they say listen obama and hillary both smell like sulfur i never said this because
[01:38:39.880 --> 01:38:44.840]  the media go crazy with but i've talked people that are in protective details i mean they're
[01:38:44.840 --> 01:38:50.040]  scared of her they say listen she's a freaking demon and she stinks and so does obama i go like
[01:38:50.040 --> 01:38:59.640]  what sulfur they smell like hell on november 8th the arrogance of washington dc will come face to
[01:38:59.640 --> 01:39:07.320]  face with the righteous verdict of the american voter it's about time so much of what he's just
[01:39:07.320 --> 01:39:11.480]  said is not right but he gets to run his campaign anyway he chooses

[01:44:42.360 --> 01:44:46.680]  gilbert's website or world men daily and show some of the articles while you're speaking right you
[01:44:46.680 --> 01:44:52.440]  you next to bill clinton for tv viewers watching i mean how much you look like him but i remember
[01:44:53.400 --> 01:45:01.720]  back at the time that when i first had your aunt on this has got me 20 years ago almost 19 years ago
[01:45:02.360 --> 01:45:06.360]  that this is what i was getting from the state police and others so let's let's get into what
[01:45:06.360 --> 01:45:10.680]  you talk about in the video when you first start hearing this you i mean before you heard about
[01:45:10.680 --> 01:45:13.720]  your mother tried to get you in the scene with the governor's mansion then later you try to get on
[01:45:13.720 --> 01:45:19.080]  the property when you're older let's let's go through this denny okay well it was my aunt actually
[01:45:19.800 --> 01:45:25.640]  um my mom had lost custody of us my aunt had sure you're right yeah right my aunt had got
[01:45:25.640 --> 01:45:30.440]  custody of a mindless here so one day she was like i want you know she took me down to the
[01:45:30.440 --> 01:45:36.680]  governor mansion and she was like you know we're going to let him know this that you were his son
[01:45:36.680 --> 01:45:42.600]  so we went down there and she had to sneak through the gates and she went up to the door and the
[01:45:42.600 --> 01:45:48.760]  butler answered the door and she asked for uh hillary and the door slammed in her face and
[01:45:48.760 --> 01:45:54.280]  they were we was told to get out the property so she she took off running snatched me by one arm
[01:45:54.280 --> 01:45:59.880]  and all i remember was my arm hurting and she snatched me to jump over the fence and she asked
[01:45:59.880 --> 01:46:03.320]  me all the time do you remember me taking to the governor mansion i said yeah i remember i remember
[01:46:03.320 --> 01:46:11.560]  me snatching my arm and taking off running so you know i mean it's never went away i mean he
[01:46:11.560 --> 01:46:19.240]  has he has delivered christmas gifts to my home by arkansas state troopers he have paid my mom under
[01:46:19.240 --> 01:46:27.000]  the table up until the time he made president 1993 he stopped doing anything for so i believe in my
[01:46:27.000 --> 01:46:35.160]  heart that he's tried to be in my life well this is a narrative that comes out from everybody that
[01:46:35.160 --> 01:46:40.360]  hillary runs the show hillary's the boss right she actually manages him and uses his issues as a
[01:46:40.360 --> 01:46:44.600]  control mechanism from your research who is it that kept you away from the man you believe to be
[01:46:44.600 --> 01:46:51.560]  your father correct i think hillary is the one that kept me away i mean as a married couple you
[01:46:51.560 --> 01:46:58.280]  you your decisions are one so i'm sure she know of me and i'm sure she have parts him
[01:46:59.320 --> 01:47:06.920]  and with the the the all the publicity all the stories and the press that you know falsely reports
[01:47:06.920 --> 01:47:14.600]  all we have taken the dna all of that is false you know so you know i really do think she she
[01:47:14.600 --> 01:47:25.720]  have played a part in and as they call banishing me you know now i know it's hard for you to talk
[01:47:25.720 --> 01:47:29.960]  about right but you've discussed mentally psychologically what this has done to you i mean
[01:47:29.960 --> 01:47:33.480]  go over the years when you first started how old were you first started learning about this
[01:47:33.480 --> 01:47:37.480]  and then what did you do over the years okay when i first started learning i was probably
[01:47:37.480 --> 01:47:43.080]  about eight or nine i was in school and you know my teachers uh they would look at me like they'd
[01:47:43.080 --> 01:47:48.120]  be whispering you know it's bill clinton's son his mother the one that claims she's she had a baby
[01:47:48.120 --> 01:47:55.880]  by bill clinton and you know it's just difficult you know growing up house to house you know not
[01:47:55.880 --> 01:48:01.880]  stable it just it became difficult my whole life so and i just thought about it you know i'm like
[01:48:03.000 --> 01:48:10.520]  there's something true to it that after all these years they still put out false reports 1999
[01:48:10.520 --> 01:48:15.800]  2000 of the false dna you know all these articles that they put out that's that's false about me
[01:48:16.680 --> 01:48:23.160]  but the article that my mother gave in 93 it's you know somebody bought rifle ownership to it and
[01:48:23.160 --> 01:48:30.600]  you know it just it make you think so two two uh two years almost two years ago two years and a
[01:48:30.600 --> 01:48:35.560]  half ago i started my facebook page campaigning for me and be a clean be a clean be my father
[01:48:35.560 --> 01:48:42.200]  i wanted to know and i've always wanted to know i just never got any help i reached out to lawyers
[01:48:42.200 --> 01:48:48.440]  and investigators they would not look into my case no one so i started campaigning my own facebook
[01:48:48.440 --> 01:48:54.680]  page and saying be a clean my father and i'm trying to get my story out well keep rolling i love the
[01:48:54.680 --> 01:48:58.920]  fact down that you're relaxed i can tell you you're nervous who wouldn't be right the head of cnn
[01:48:59.560 --> 01:49:03.800]  jeff zucker and talk about wiki leaks too they order them don't talk about bill clinton sex crimes
[01:49:03.800 --> 01:49:07.800]  right talk about hillary's health don't talk about a little gentleman's children don't talk about it
[01:49:07.800 --> 01:49:13.320]  he quote thinks it's a ridiculous hoax even though we went and looked at the star they never did the
[01:49:13.320 --> 01:49:18.200]  dna test yes sir they did a quote test that wasn't even a dna test so that's how they do it that's
[01:49:18.200 --> 01:49:23.000]  how they get away with it correct and and and cover it but i mean regardless bill clinton's
[01:49:23.000 --> 01:49:28.040]  known for all of this what do you just think about the general sense of what's happening in the country
[01:49:28.040 --> 01:49:37.400]  today i mean i think a lot about i actually i think you know as far as she stand up and saying uh
[01:49:37.400 --> 01:49:43.400]  well the kids you know kids gonna be we're gonna make sure kids have the rightful
[01:49:44.440 --> 01:49:49.960]  you know taking care of them and and rightful schools you know and and all this i actually
[01:49:49.960 --> 01:49:57.960]  think that they are lies and i think is she just using it to to make to um be in office
[01:50:01.960 --> 01:50:07.320]  and to be clear today when i went there about an hour before he went on air i said listen we've never
[01:50:07.320 --> 01:50:11.800]  really talked we've talked over the phone a couple times my crew has you just flew in today you've
[01:50:11.800 --> 01:50:16.200]  been talking to the bigs and stuff i said will you just please write notes on the questions you want
[01:50:16.200 --> 01:50:20.680]  me to ask and you wrote this up these are your thoughts you've got these are your questions
[01:50:20.680 --> 01:50:24.520]  one thing they got brought up is bill clinton a couple weeks ago got asked about his son reported
[01:50:24.520 --> 01:50:29.880]  son danie williams uh by a youtuber called charlie in the box i want to skip this network break
[01:50:29.880 --> 01:50:34.760]  right this is so important i want to play this since you mentioned this and just again go back
[01:50:34.760 --> 01:50:38.520]  to if you were really in the room of bill clinton because you are in the room with him he will
[01:50:38.520 --> 01:50:43.560]  watch this undoubtedly yes i mean you know spill it out there because you need to talk directly to him
[01:50:43.560 --> 01:50:47.800]  uh because uh i've talked to the arkansas state police back when i was being given these these
[01:50:47.800 --> 01:50:52.200]  these tips believe me they didn't send people down here to get me fired and get my ass beaten
[01:50:52.200 --> 01:50:57.320]  right because you weren't his uh you know weren't his illegitimate son they're concerned about this

[02:02:40.680 --> 02:02:50.600]  gang or nothing in 1999 2000 hillary hillary and president clinton post uh they helped with this
[02:02:50.600 --> 02:02:57.400]  false dna test and i think it was put out to discredit my story for her uh running the senate
[02:02:57.400 --> 02:03:03.400]  of the state so and be clear we've looked at it right the star owned by top plenton donors
[02:03:03.400 --> 02:03:07.960]  did a test that wasn't even dna test so no wonder what they say the test showed it wasn't well yeah
[02:03:07.960 --> 02:03:14.360]  if they do like a blood test for you know hepatitis for maternity it ain't gonna work right
[02:03:15.880 --> 02:03:20.840]  and just what would your mother say to you when the christmas presents came i mean did you ever
[02:03:20.840 --> 02:03:25.240]  see the state troopers i mean i mean describe that right i was outside playing i i seen them leave
[02:03:25.240 --> 02:03:29.720]  while they didn't they didn't pull up in the state trooper police car i seen them leave you know he
[02:03:29.720 --> 02:03:34.520]  get out with his police state trooper outfit on and i see them leave and i can read the text and they
[02:03:34.520 --> 02:03:41.960]  say you know uh state government tags on the back and as soon as they left they they brought in
[02:03:41.960 --> 02:03:47.000]  back as soon as they left my um uh come get us from outside playing she was like come in
[02:03:48.200 --> 02:03:53.400]  and she's like i got these gifts that was brought in by your dad i said brought in by my dad she's
[02:03:53.400 --> 02:03:58.440]  like yeah i said he brought me gifts she's like yeah so me and my little brothers and sisters we
[02:03:58.440 --> 02:04:03.560]  went through the gifts and split them between each other and it was just one gift that stood out it was
[02:04:03.560 --> 02:04:11.560]  a gi joe man so i i took the gi joe man i gave the hula hoops and the other gifts to him my little
[02:04:11.560 --> 02:04:18.440]  sister in him but it just had me thinking and you know at the time we were kids so we didn't
[02:04:18.440 --> 02:04:24.040]  too much you know we went off straight to playing with the toys but over the years you know i just
[02:04:24.040 --> 02:04:30.200]  think about that i just i just go back into that day of when they dropped the gift off i just wonder
[02:04:30.200 --> 02:04:37.160]  why if if he feel that he wasn't my daddy why even assist on wasting the time i'll be honest i don't
[02:04:37.160 --> 02:04:40.840]  want to get bill clinton to pass but i've always picked up on this he's like a twisted sad character
[02:04:40.840 --> 02:04:46.280]  who's used hillary's pure evil and and you see that you see the fact that he wanted to do the right
[02:04:46.280 --> 02:04:50.840]  thing let's talk about the report how she shut it down how your aunt tried to get you in your baby

[02:08:12.440 --> 02:08:19.880]  election 2016 americanism versus globalism you're listening to the alice jones show
[02:08:19.880 --> 02:08:36.280]  broadcasting from austin texas worldwide
[02:08:37.400 --> 02:08:42.120]  danie williams is our guest i just had one of our writers rachel failen shown me a personal
[02:08:42.120 --> 02:08:47.800]  drudge tweet talking about all the deception that went on the people lying to him back when all
[02:08:47.800 --> 02:08:51.960]  these quote dna tests came out we probably put that up on screen and bring that up for danie
[02:08:51.960 --> 02:08:58.200]  williams uh there it is i was lied to directly by walter ishington at the time uh magazine over
[02:08:58.200 --> 02:09:03.240]  dna tests on danie williams clinton's alleged son there wasn't one and that's what we've proven they
[02:09:03.240 --> 02:09:09.000]  did a test that wasn't a dna test now right you wrote just in your own thoughts today questions
[02:09:09.960 --> 02:09:13.960]  that were probably good for me to bring up but speaking of so many of these
[02:09:13.960 --> 02:09:20.680]  again i go back to the beginning addressing bill clinton i mean you've already said a lot but you
[02:09:20.680 --> 02:09:25.080]  say oh i'm nervous i don't want and i get it you're on live radio and tv but specifically
[02:09:25.720 --> 02:09:29.160]  again you're not political i mean you've told me this probably i'm not for trump
[02:09:29.160 --> 02:09:33.240]  i'm not getting into trump i never even asked that did i ask you to go after i mean no i don't
[02:09:33.240 --> 02:09:39.320]  support no one i'm not i'm not voting at the time i mean you just want to meet if you believe
[02:09:39.320 --> 02:09:46.360]  you're dead i just want the truth i feel like if i'm standing here to prove my story and who i am
[02:09:46.360 --> 02:09:52.440]  and the truth behind my story i feel that he has to stand up and prove that he's not my father if
[02:09:52.440 --> 02:09:59.800]  he claims that he's not my father and you know i like to actually please don't get in the way of this
[02:09:59.800 --> 02:10:08.920]  you know let it you know let me know the truth you know let let it be known let let the world know
[02:10:08.920 --> 02:10:14.680]  i mean the world know that you fake the DNA test the world know that all the other public stories
[02:10:14.680 --> 02:10:21.640]  out so i mean it's my turn to answer the truth i was thinking you can do a genetic profile we know
[02:10:21.640 --> 02:10:27.400]  clinton's basic background right and if it matches up with who he claims his backgrounds are then he's
[02:10:27.400 --> 02:10:34.680]  got a lot of pressure on him here's a question then i remember researching this going back 20 years
[02:10:34.680 --> 02:10:40.200]  ago yes sir what did hillary do specifically i heard she threatened my wrong your mother walked
[02:10:40.200 --> 02:10:47.000]  through that who who ended the relationship of the state police bringing you 700 a month for
[02:10:47.000 --> 02:10:52.760]  your mom take her to the family and christmas presents on on christmas right and in my heart i
[02:10:52.760 --> 02:10:59.720]  believe hillary ended all of that once he made president you know because it's like he wanted
[02:10:59.720 --> 02:11:04.680]  he wanted to have something to do with me i mean if he took the time out to deliver have money
[02:11:04.680 --> 02:11:09.800]  delivered have present delivery he knew in his heart and he wanted to in his heart but like
[02:11:09.800 --> 02:11:16.040]  i say i feel that she does have something to do with i feel that she you know she does
[02:11:16.040 --> 02:11:22.040]  breaking that all up like hillary she she's very smart so at the time of bill clinton
[02:11:22.040 --> 02:11:29.240]  becoming to his success she was planning her success you know and and then being the president
[02:11:29.240 --> 02:11:35.800]  for herself one day so yeah i feel that she stepped in and you know covered it up had you
[02:11:35.800 --> 02:11:45.400]  know had it hidden had you know hushed it up but i'll never stop i want to i'm gonna you know
[02:11:46.200 --> 02:11:51.160]  keep this going i'm gonna search for the truth and and you know if it takes my life or well you
[02:11:51.160 --> 02:11:59.080]  know i'd rather die trying to find the truth of who i am then back home you know just doing
[02:11:59.080 --> 02:12:05.480]  other things i'd rather be you know dying you know knowing the right thing doing the right thing
[02:12:07.000 --> 02:12:11.160]  are you saying you're concerned about your safety i mean yes it's been plenty of times
[02:12:11.160 --> 02:12:17.880]  my safety my kids say that we you know i'm from little roger so you know i'm i'm raising my kids
[02:12:17.880 --> 02:12:23.640]  in hot springs the boyhood the boyhood home of bill clinton where he was raised so yeah i feel
[02:12:23.640 --> 02:12:32.120]  feel sometimes about my safety but i won't stop danie williams reported son of bill clinton
[02:12:32.120 --> 02:12:36.040]  i've been here in this for 20 years the witnesses we've talked to the state police you name it i
[02:12:36.040 --> 02:12:39.320]  mean this was 20 years ago i was talking to his aunt this is isn't something new it's coming up
[02:12:39.320 --> 02:12:48.600]  now because the clintons are back again looking at this why again why would bill clinton give you
[02:12:48.600 --> 02:12:53.800]  presents and give you money if you weren't right why would he you know i mean was he playing a
[02:12:53.800 --> 02:12:59.320]  little game you know to me i feel that he was trying to be in my life well it does seem he's
[02:12:59.320 --> 02:13:05.640]  the more human of the two right other points i've got a lot of questions but other points you think
[02:13:05.640 --> 02:13:12.040]  are important other points i think are important i mean you can look at me and see you know see the
[02:13:12.040 --> 02:13:19.640]  futures of him and me so that's a major important point you know i started my facebook page two and
[02:13:19.640 --> 02:13:25.080]  a half years ago and and that's what i did i put me beside him i wanted people to know look at us
[02:13:25.080 --> 02:13:31.320]  you know and i wanted i wanted thoughts and feedback on what people thought you know and i
[02:13:31.320 --> 02:13:37.640]  take i take the good in the bag and i keep pushing with doing what's right myself danie let's bring
[02:13:37.640 --> 02:13:42.360]  this up i don't judge your mother hell i have to win the country probably done some more things right
[02:13:42.360 --> 02:13:46.280]  this is how the world works old profession you know what she has to do is feed her kids
[02:13:47.720 --> 02:13:52.760]  there was a governing class in little rock arkansas but looking at this
[02:13:55.320 --> 02:14:03.400]  why do you think why do you think hillary um well before i get to that look at the similar
[02:14:03.400 --> 02:14:08.200]  backgrounds you've got bill clinton's mother reportedly being a prostitute to the mafia
[02:14:08.200 --> 02:14:13.800]  exactly in hot springs right well documented that is well documented exactly reportedly to a governor
[02:14:13.800 --> 02:14:18.440]  rockfeller right in al Capone's to run the whole country out of little rock and in hot springs he
[02:14:18.440 --> 02:14:22.120]  lived there half the year folks don't know how the mafia worked that's where the moonshine was made
[02:14:22.120 --> 02:14:27.800]  right up until like the 40s so you've got all this going on and you've got bill clinton's mother a
[02:14:27.800 --> 02:14:32.200]  lady of the night a prostitute same history as your mother's maybe that's why he felt guilty
[02:14:32.200 --> 02:14:37.240]  because he never got to see his father exactly and you know what i do my research i read i
[02:14:37.240 --> 02:14:43.320]  didn't read about all that i've been reading about this since i was 13 14 and on his mother
[02:14:43.320 --> 02:14:48.520]  on who his father could be and you know it's just like he had this hard time why would he
[02:14:48.520 --> 02:14:56.200]  do his own child like that i mean yes my mother was a working lady but far as from my understanding
[02:14:56.200 --> 02:15:03.000]  is that they dated he came on several occasions that's where he liked her so much right he kept
[02:15:03.000 --> 02:15:08.040]  wouldn't be the first time that happened right exactly so i feel that i mean i knew she had to
[02:15:08.040 --> 02:15:13.720]  do what she do to to take care of us to bring in food to bring in clothes for us so we can you know
[02:15:15.880 --> 02:15:22.440]  be all right for us for us but at the same time i feel that it was more than just money between him
[02:15:22.440 --> 02:15:31.640]  and her so danny williams reported son who was basically ignored thrown out there what's the
[02:15:31.640 --> 02:15:38.280]  word you use i just banished banished banished they banished me they said i was raised in australia
[02:15:38.280 --> 02:15:42.600]  they said i went to the goodest school no i was raised in little rock and with the mclean high
[02:15:42.600 --> 02:15:49.720]  school off god springs in little rock i didn't graduate i got tons of facebook friends went to
[02:15:49.720 --> 02:15:55.960]  school with me that can confront my story that's right but you did get your g ed later do you have
[02:15:55.960 --> 02:16:01.320]  right i went back to school i went back to school at 21 get my g ed i was trying to become a welder
[02:16:01.960 --> 02:16:06.760]  and take care of my kids at the time you know i had my first child at 16 i was on the way with my
[02:16:07.320 --> 02:16:13.320]  second child at 21 so i wanted to do better for my kids but i always had this setback on
[02:16:13.320 --> 02:16:18.440]  what about my father well you know i need to know my father you know how early on did you hear from
[02:16:18.440 --> 02:16:22.680]  like you said the preachers in the public schools that booklet was your daddy right preachers just
[02:16:22.680 --> 02:16:27.960]  come over our house all the time when i was seven eight years old i remember one preacher and that's
[02:16:27.960 --> 02:16:34.600]  that's preacher uh mechatized he's the one that started the story on bill clinton when he was
[02:16:34.600 --> 02:16:39.640]  running for president about him having a black son he called it the black sheep of the family
[02:16:39.640 --> 02:16:46.040]  so you know this been going on throughout my whole life everybody i run into oh he looked you know
[02:16:46.040 --> 02:16:50.600]  they they point and they whisper you know he looked just like him you know that's bill son
[02:16:51.320 --> 02:16:56.520]  and you know sometimes it was sad and sometimes it was you know it strengthened me because i
[02:16:56.520 --> 02:17:06.600]  knew that one day i was able to stand up for what i believe in i brought this up three times
[02:17:06.600 --> 02:17:09.640]  and you've done a great job but i was going to give you the floor here just
[02:17:10.520 --> 02:17:14.520]  denny williams whatever you want to say to the world the people demonizing you at cnn the people
[02:17:14.520 --> 02:17:19.080]  saying don't cover your story if your story was so weak they'd want to cover it because they could
[02:17:19.080 --> 02:17:25.720]  discredit us i'd like to ask cnn in the back off i'd like to ask hillary with the most up respect
[02:17:27.080 --> 02:17:34.280]  and just uh please don't stand in the way i'd like to let my father know i does want to meet
[02:17:34.280 --> 02:17:38.840]  you one day i does want to shake your hand well i do want to meet you i do want to shake your hand
[02:17:38.840 --> 02:17:46.120]  excuse me um i want my children to know that they have a grandfather you know and what type of
[02:17:46.120 --> 02:17:52.360]  grandfather he was he was a good man he you know he he done good when he was president i mean
[02:17:53.160 --> 02:18:00.120]  but far as with my life you know he's just fair you so i just want to you know i just want him to
[02:18:00.120 --> 02:18:06.120]  know that i am looking forward to meet you i am looking forward for my kids to know you i am looking
[02:18:06.120 --> 02:18:13.720]  for for a dna sample i mean i asked you to do the right thing if i was worth hundreds of millions
[02:18:13.720 --> 02:18:19.160]  of dollars i'd be taking care of my grandkids right don't care what color they are and danie you come
[02:18:19.160 --> 02:18:23.720]  off as very credible my gut tells me you're bill clinton's son i remember the history 20 years ago
[02:18:23.720 --> 02:18:28.520]  i remember all the cover-ups all of it and we sit here looking at this it's just indicative of the
[02:18:28.520 --> 02:18:33.160]  larger lies i remember talking to the sources that knew you know knew your mother who's still with us
[02:18:33.160 --> 02:18:39.400]  today i mean is it accurate that state police came and said you shut up about this we're gonna
[02:18:39.400 --> 02:18:45.080]  figure out how to throw your butt in jail 100% accurate my mom's story never changed so so get
[02:18:45.080 --> 02:18:52.200]  into what hillary reportedly did um well what what it was from from like from what i was told
[02:18:52.200 --> 02:18:59.480]  at 93 you know doing all the allegations of me being his son you know she was trying to hush
[02:18:59.480 --> 02:19:03.880]  you up you know there was there was straightener you know there was passing by the house they kicked
[02:19:03.880 --> 02:19:08.920]  in my grandma on door the first picture they ever got of me was the baby picture with the
[02:19:08.920 --> 02:19:14.040]  arkansas razor back shirt on she kept right i'm not talking about my grandma on door and start
[02:19:14.040 --> 02:19:18.680]  over sorry i don't break go ahead they took that they took that picture they they kicked in my
[02:19:18.680 --> 02:19:22.600]  grandma on door and stay troopers they ain't took that picture off the wall that was the first
[02:19:22.600 --> 02:19:29.320]  picture they ever had that picture was not sold to the tabloids was not you know it was cooking
[02:19:29.320 --> 02:19:34.520]  so what did they do they took that picture off the wall right from my granny describe that take
[02:19:34.520 --> 02:19:40.440]  your time talk about that well if you're not his son why are they kicking doors down right i mean
[02:19:40.440 --> 02:19:45.960]  at the time i was a kid i can't describe it in and what my mom came but at the time i i know and
[02:19:45.960 --> 02:19:50.360]  she always told me how they got the first picture they kicked in my granny door and they took the
[02:19:50.360 --> 02:19:58.360]  picture off the wall and what was the point of that i don't know at the time my mom my mother
[02:19:58.360 --> 02:20:05.240]  wasn't given the story and and the the the doc uh preacher macintosh had came out with on the story
[02:20:05.240 --> 02:20:09.560]  so they was trying to get in contact with my mom on stories and you know at the time they
[02:20:09.560 --> 02:20:14.520]  was trying to hush i get it they were getting rid of the picture that proved it right right and so
[02:20:14.520 --> 02:20:20.520]  like i said my mama my mother she took a story she took a dna i mean she took a uh a polygraph
[02:20:20.520 --> 02:20:26.920]  test in 93 because sister her story and she passed it 100 pasty and the story never changed
[02:20:26.920 --> 02:20:31.080]  today it's still the same today you can pick you remember who gave the polygraph
[02:20:32.680 --> 02:20:37.720]  i was in 93 i was probably five or six years no i understand right so i probably talked to your
[02:20:37.720 --> 02:20:43.640]  mom and your aunt we need to get them on right this is powerful information dany but look she says
[02:20:43.640 --> 02:20:47.320]  she hadn't fallen down having convulsions we catch it on tape she says she didn't sell us out with
[02:20:47.320 --> 02:20:51.720]  chinese it comes out the weekly she says she isn't running the media it comes out obama says he
[02:20:51.720 --> 02:20:55.480]  didn't want our guns comes out in the emails he wants to ban them i mean it seems like stuff's
[02:20:55.480 --> 02:21:00.680]  turning against them right now right she says she wanted to do the most get the the kids the most
[02:21:00.680 --> 02:21:05.880]  the best opportunities in in this world i'm one kid that they have turned their back on
[02:21:05.880 --> 02:21:11.560]  and deserve the best opportunities for my children i was about to ask i mean because i just want to
[02:21:11.560 --> 02:21:15.400]  help all american children no matter what color they are but black unemployment's basically doubled
[02:21:15.400 --> 02:21:20.040]  under obama as if just you just don't matter right and then i see hillary claiming how
[02:21:20.040 --> 02:21:26.200]  how trumps all this big races and the rest of it separate from politics though i'd actually see
[02:21:26.200 --> 02:21:30.040]  you as an asset if i was them i don't know why they didn't just admit all this and go with it
[02:21:30.040 --> 02:21:34.600]  later after they'd already been president exactly i mean if they had any brains that they have in
[02:21:34.600 --> 02:21:38.920]  this world they would have you know step up
[02:21:42.440 --> 02:21:45.240]  dany i can sit here and ask you a million questions but you know
[02:21:45.240 --> 02:21:51.480]  you know we talk about i mean you wrote this i want to know what it was like to be
[02:21:53.000 --> 02:22:00.120]  in her presence so i want to i wanted to know what was like what was i wanted i want to have
[02:22:00.120 --> 02:22:04.280]  the opportunities that chelsea had i wanted to because i'm reading this you wrote this for you
[02:22:04.280 --> 02:22:07.720]  came on i said hey give me some questions read this was right these are so i mean you're sure
[02:22:07.720 --> 02:22:11.160]  these are so personal though i don't even know what they mean because it's your thoughts it's like
[02:22:11.160 --> 02:22:15.720]  i wanted to know what it was like to be uh you know you know her parents let's explain
[02:22:15.720 --> 02:22:21.560]  these questions you wanted me to ask you go ahead i mean basically this is from the heart
[02:22:21.560 --> 02:22:26.440]  right before you went live i said write out what it is and to be honest i guess so from your heart
[02:22:26.440 --> 02:22:32.040]  it's like so personal i don't know what it means at the time okay i said about last year at the time
[02:22:32.040 --> 02:22:37.880]  hillary had a campaign at philandis mill college which is a black owned college in little augersaw
[02:22:37.880 --> 02:22:42.840]  i've never been in her presence so at the time i wanted to know how i didn't feel to be in her
[02:22:42.840 --> 02:22:49.400]  presence so we went to the campaign me and a couple of my friends and i still i made sure i
[02:22:49.400 --> 02:22:56.280]  stood right in front of the podium which we got clippings of it and it seemed like she spoke directly
[02:22:56.280 --> 02:23:01.320]  at me i mean it wasn't directly at me because she had turned and no talk to the crowd but
[02:23:01.320 --> 02:23:08.200]  the thing that she spoke about how how it was hard her mother raising her how her chelsea
[02:23:08.200 --> 02:23:13.800]  would have the best you know and her kids would have the best opportunities you know and it just
[02:23:13.800 --> 02:23:18.840]  felt directly at me at the time and i was facing her you know and it felt like she knew who i was
[02:23:19.800 --> 02:23:26.360]  she she you know and you know it was hurtful and then you know as i left you know we tried to i
[02:23:26.360 --> 02:23:31.320]  tried to get a picture with her they heavy up and got her out of there so like i said it was hateful i
[02:23:31.320 --> 02:23:36.920]  mean hurtful as i left because i kept thinking about like you know she know me she she she
[02:23:36.920 --> 02:23:41.080]  knows about my story she knows about me being his son she's talking about family and being
[02:23:41.080 --> 02:23:48.920]  twitterer family and there you are wanting this connection or discover wow exactly and so you know
[02:23:48.920 --> 02:23:54.520]  and it's hurt because she she talked about her family her mother you know so i'm like you know
[02:23:54.520 --> 02:23:59.880]  well let's go some first one of these points you wanted to make there's so many um
[02:24:01.320 --> 02:24:05.320]  you know i love the fact because we didn't script this knowing my father helped so many people in
[02:24:05.320 --> 02:24:10.760]  the world right i mean i could differ with that but this is how honest this all is these questions
[02:24:11.320 --> 02:24:14.440]  i mean you're thinking he's this really great guy and you're wondering why this is happening i mean
[02:24:14.440 --> 02:24:19.160]  because i took it i take trips to his library i think i take my kids to his library you know i let
[02:24:19.160 --> 02:24:24.360]  him know you know this your grandfather that's a little right right and just all the pictures of you
[02:24:24.360 --> 02:24:30.440]  know him doing so much he didn't have hadie he didn't have you know he didn't do so much for the
[02:24:30.440 --> 02:24:35.720]  world and just like you know what have he done for me why haven't he done nothing for me i think
[02:24:35.720 --> 02:24:41.480]  he's helping me like he helped him right you know he didn't really didn't hate you i want to talk
[02:24:41.480 --> 02:24:46.200]  about your dad here i just this is surreal folks because he really wrote these is how much he loves
[02:24:46.200 --> 02:24:51.400]  his dad this is our big scripted thing how scripted we heard it before is i want to cry because
[02:24:51.400 --> 02:24:54.040]  i don't want to say stuff here with this man who i believe is bill clinton's son
[02:24:55.640 --> 02:25:00.920]  i just at this point i i this is getting too this is getting too real i mean bill clinton up there
[02:25:01.960 --> 02:25:06.200]  you know doing what he's doing obama attacking me hillary attacking me and all i know is

[02:25:13.800 --> 02:25:18.760]  in between hillary and obama and bill i'm not sentenced to make you feel good hillary is way
[02:25:18.760 --> 02:25:25.640]  worse than both of them right i think so too and um like she said up and say black lives matter i mean

[02:34:29.240 --> 02:34:33.400]  it's the power behind the throne we should be looking at which is why i hope bill clinton hillary
[02:34:33.400 --> 02:34:38.120]  rediscovered their humanity and i said danie in closing i want to give you the floor so you can
[02:34:38.120 --> 02:34:43.640]  just speak from the heart what else you want to say you said well i just wish that hillary would

[02:35:13.320 --> 02:35:19.960]  so we can put this all to risk i mean we know what's true just you know step up and face it
[02:35:22.520 --> 02:35:29.480]  and i i like to say i like to ask seeing in the bag off on me speaking the truth about who i am
[02:35:30.920 --> 02:35:35.800]  i when i start i will keep doing what i have to do to get my story out let me ask this question
[02:35:35.800 --> 02:35:40.440]  this is bigger than politics because i've been honest with people if hillary gets that unless
[02:35:40.440 --> 02:35:45.880]  he shuts down all for his speech which he can try it's a gamble we're going to get world famous
[02:35:45.880 --> 02:35:49.960]  biggest thing in the world trump gets in i'm tied to him he won't be able to fix everything i'll get
[02:35:49.960 --> 02:35:53.960]  blamed for that we're going to be hurt by trump being you know if i was if i was mackey of ellie
[02:35:53.960 --> 02:36:00.760]  and i'd go for hillary at least probably i'm not i really care about humanity but i do the right
[02:36:00.760 --> 02:36:04.120]  thing i don't care where the chips fall i should the right thing that's how i operate it's hard
[02:36:04.120 --> 02:36:07.000]  enough to tell the truth much less make crap up i mean i'm just gonna tell the truth that's the
[02:36:07.000 --> 02:36:13.240]  thing i know everybody knows it exactly but would you we didn't talk about this probably
[02:36:14.040 --> 02:36:19.720]  but if the clinton's non-disclosures whatever when you got there met with him not even monetary but
[02:36:19.720 --> 02:36:24.200]  just admit he's your daddy hug you hell take you on a vacation once a year i know you that's
[02:36:24.200 --> 02:36:29.320]  what you want imagine want to know your dad so so it's not you told us probably we talked about
[02:36:29.320 --> 02:36:32.680]  probably said i don't want money i just want to know he's my dad i wanted to acknowledge me
[02:36:32.680 --> 02:36:36.120]  what is it you're looking for from bill you're not just here wanting to paycheck from some guy
[02:36:36.120 --> 02:36:40.920]  to get i'm not just here for a paycheck i'm here for a knowledge me i want him to acknowledge me
[02:36:40.920 --> 02:36:50.200]  on who i am and that i am his son i mean i know i know personally in my heart and believe in my
[02:36:50.200 --> 02:36:56.680]  heart that i am his son i just want him to step up and you know step up to the plate
[02:37:00.200 --> 02:37:05.560]  but like you said hillary he did step up somewhat exactly i felt he did step up somewhere other
[02:37:05.560 --> 02:37:10.280]  than that we wouldn't receive the money we received the gifts we received so i felt that he wanted
[02:37:10.280 --> 02:37:15.160]  a part of my life so that's that's the reason i'm here today to ask hillary please do not get in the
[02:37:15.160 --> 02:37:26.120]  way and please mr clinton step up to the plate i don't want to prompt you i haven't done that
[02:37:26.120 --> 02:37:31.400]  any because i i just feel people show what they believe in right but you believe he's your dad i
[02:37:31.400 --> 02:37:38.760]  mean you want to dress him as your dad yes sir i'm danny williams the son of bill clinton
[02:37:39.560 --> 02:37:47.640]  i'm here today to get the truth out about me and who i am yes i want to dress you as my dad
[02:37:48.600 --> 02:37:54.200]  and i want to know the truth is i want to get to the bottom of it and know the truth about you
[02:37:54.200 --> 02:38:02.680]  being my father i want to know all about you all about your family thank you
[02:38:04.440 --> 02:38:11.800]  so you just want to be recognized by your family right very powerful panty i believe you and i
[02:38:11.800 --> 02:38:17.640]  talked to state trippers and others off record and i hit a nerve with you your family on and a bunch
[02:38:17.640 --> 02:38:21.080]  of other things i don't know what hit the nerve right it's wake up with you it was a bunch of
[02:38:21.080 --> 02:38:25.800]  stuff i was going after clinton's and they got pissed right and uh they wouldn't do that it wasn't
[02:38:25.800 --> 02:38:29.880]  real i mean hell those people all the internet claim and i i'm married to them and i raped them
[02:38:29.880 --> 02:38:34.120]  and i'm an easter bunny and i'm a devil worshiper and i'm a badic and assassin i work for israel and
[02:38:34.120 --> 02:38:39.720]  i work for reptiles and i it's not true i'm not a space alien so i don't care but let me tell you
[02:38:39.720 --> 02:38:46.200]  they get really upset when when you get brought up right they should i mean it'd been nice i went to
[02:38:46.200 --> 02:38:53.640]  bed hungry bowled up starving because i had to make sure my baby brother and sister eat and
[02:38:53.640 --> 02:39:03.000]  went without eating you know they should i mean it's okay go ahead and say it whatever else you
[02:39:03.000 --> 02:39:08.360]  want to end i'm trying to keep for crying it's okay but yeah they should when did you think of the
[02:39:08.360 --> 02:39:17.640]  suicide i mean i was in my teens and going through you know far as house to house clothes not clean
[02:39:17.640 --> 02:39:22.840]  you know on the streets just you know living the way bombs live you know and it just was hurtful
[02:39:23.960 --> 02:39:29.960]  and then i just had to pull myself out of that you know i've been taking care of me and my kids
[02:39:29.960 --> 02:39:38.520]  i'm not asking for money i'm i'm asking for a simple acknowledgement in the DNA that's it well bill
[02:39:38.520 --> 02:39:43.160]  clinton can still redeem his humanity but he has to do it before he dies and he looks pretty long
[02:39:43.160 --> 02:39:48.280]  on the tooth right that's another one of the points you want me to ask you he said your dad
[02:39:48.280 --> 02:39:51.880]  your dad doesn't look too good no he just want to meet him before he does right he does look
[02:39:51.880 --> 02:39:57.560]  unhealthy and i does feel you know his time is winding down here and i does want to meet him
[02:39:57.560 --> 02:40:03.160]  i want my kids to know him we want to know who our father i want to know who my father is they want
[02:40:03.160 --> 02:40:11.400]  to know who their grandfather is like your mother told you she knew he was a daddy because there was
[02:40:11.400 --> 02:40:19.800]  one white guy one white guy that she had been involved with at that time i say it was probably
[02:40:19.800 --> 02:40:31.640]  1984 around march 1984 my my go back because i was born in 1985 december the 7 1985 so you know i
[02:40:32.520 --> 02:40:37.080]  i go back i think about you know i do a lot of research and you know and i actually like i say
[02:40:37.080 --> 02:40:43.720]  her story never changed it's always been consistent it's always been the same well she's proud of
[02:40:43.720 --> 02:40:48.600]  what you're doing now yeah she's very proud i mean she's probably somewhere breaking down crying
[02:40:48.600 --> 02:40:53.400]  because i'm trying to keep her crying myself so i know she's very proud i mean well danny i'll tell
[02:40:53.400 --> 02:40:57.640]  you you take a rest doing this so do i we're not bragging but the clintons are particular people
[02:40:57.640 --> 02:41:02.440]  are back i'm particularly evil and so we're here telling like it is and i believe your story and
[02:41:02.440 --> 02:41:06.120]  i hope you get some justice and i hope the people out there that are paid corporate
[02:41:06.120 --> 02:41:10.520]  minions you know aren't too nasty about this but don't take it bad you've just come here and told
[02:41:10.520 --> 02:41:16.200]  the truth you put out this report bill clinton's sons tells hillary step aside dealing with all
[02:41:16.200 --> 02:41:21.080]  the horrible things he's done that's up on info wars dot com drudge report dot com we appreciate
[02:41:21.080 --> 02:41:25.320]  the courage of all these affiliates of the bottom line we're just exploring this we were proving right
[02:41:25.320 --> 02:41:29.000]  about hillary being sick proving right about the gun control proving right about the tpp
[02:41:29.640 --> 02:41:33.880]  nsa spying proving right on you know bill clinton and monica lawinsky drudge was
[02:41:34.600 --> 02:41:38.840]  we get it right 99 percent of the time and and i think if it comes out and there's a third part
[02:41:38.840 --> 02:41:43.240]  they do a dna test you know and then they say that you're not his son and i think you would accept
[02:41:43.240 --> 02:41:49.240]  that right all right danie williams well thank you anything else i want to thank you for giving

[02:44:11.000 --> 02:44:17.160]  this this uh trump uh where trump talks about this loyalty in the party with o'reilly who's
[02:44:17.160 --> 02:44:21.320]  laughing at him talking about how these guys are total sellers of this conspiracy and then the
[02:44:21.320 --> 02:44:25.720]  mike huckabee compares trump to clinton we're gonna play both those back to back and come back
[02:44:25.720 --> 02:44:29.400]  after the break and i'll get into the russia situation and the economy danie williams thank you
[02:44:29.400 --> 02:44:34.760]  my friend appreciate your courage appreciate everybody else uh covering this today we'll be back
[02:44:34.760 --> 02:44:40.520]  stay with us you attacked mccain today as well because he was he was mad about the the tape thing
[02:44:41.080 --> 02:44:45.240]  if you're elected well mccain was interesting you're gonna you want to hear mccain well i i know
[02:44:45.240 --> 02:44:50.760]  you're gonna weigh on his desperate he was desperate to get my endorsement i gave him the
[02:44:50.760 --> 02:44:55.640]  endorsement because he needed it for the primary and frankly he ran against a very very good woman
[02:44:55.640 --> 02:44:59.320]  i i'm feel very bad like i gave him the endorsement but that's okay all right but he doesn't like
[02:44:59.320 --> 02:45:05.560]  my endorsement he easily wins his primary he easily wins his primary and then all of a sudden uh you
[02:45:05.560 --> 02:45:11.000]  know he does the unendorsed he didn't like the tape thing he's he's never heard oh i give me a break
[02:45:11.000 --> 02:45:16.360]  he's never heard salty language before you know john mccain who has probably the dirtiest mouth in
[02:45:16.360 --> 02:45:22.520]  all of the senate has never heard you know he talked about lewd can i ask the question please
[02:45:22.520 --> 02:45:27.880]  please if you're elected president you're gonna need mccain and you're gonna need ryan you're
[02:45:27.880 --> 02:45:33.080]  gonna need these guys they'll be there they'll be there uh i would think that ryan maybe wouldn't
[02:45:33.080 --> 02:45:37.640]  be there maybe he'll be in a different position but i mccain will be there they'll all be there
[02:45:37.640 --> 02:45:42.680]  and you think they're gonna all cooperate with you after you trash in them i get along i know you
[02:45:42.680 --> 02:45:46.680]  don't believe this well i get along with you for 20 years i guess i can get along with anybody
[02:45:46.680 --> 02:45:51.880]  frankly but uh to be honest with you bill i get along with people and i think you know that
[02:45:51.880 --> 02:45:54.920]  may be better than anybody i don't know what good it does i get along with them i don't know what good
[02:45:54.920 --> 02:46:00.680]  it does to trash people you could say i disagree i wish they would endorse me but to trash him i don't
[02:46:00.680 --> 02:46:06.280]  know what that good that does because he he was begging for my endorsement i know when his friends
[02:46:06.280 --> 02:46:11.640]  are calling me the better man the first sign of a little bit of difficulty he unendorses all right
[02:46:11.640 --> 02:46:15.720]  i wouldn't want to be in a foxhole with a lot of these people that i can tell you mccain's a brave
[02:46:15.720 --> 02:46:20.840]  including ryan while we've talked about the the hit trumps taken in the polls as a result of that
[02:46:20.840 --> 02:46:27.320]  tape and so on i don't know that that sort of the mainstream republican class or you know even
[02:46:27.960 --> 02:46:34.520]  sort of these these elites if you will understand how invigorating it was for trump supporters
[02:46:34.520 --> 02:46:40.360]  to see trump turn to hillary clinton and let her have it on some of those issues like emails
[02:46:40.360 --> 02:46:46.440]  and trustworthiness and honesty which we've never seen anybody look right at her and do
[02:46:46.440 --> 02:46:52.520]  do the one thing you have to say about trump that he is fearless this is a guy that is comfortable
[02:46:52.520 --> 02:46:57.160]  enough in his views whether you like them or not that he's going to take it straight to the other
[02:46:57.160 --> 02:47:02.600]  person to their face he's not too faced he's not a phony look i've said this about it megan he's
[02:47:02.600 --> 02:47:09.960]  like captain quint in the original movie jaws he's vulgar he's salty he might even get drunk he's
[02:47:09.960 --> 02:47:15.720]  he's just uh he doesn't drink terrible but but hold on here okay he's the guy who's going to save
[02:47:15.720 --> 02:47:21.960]  your butt and save your family and so at the end of the day when he kills the shark you're happy
[02:47:21.960 --> 02:47:27.480]  about it now hillary is the shark she's going to eat your boat she's going to have open borders
[02:47:28.280 --> 02:47:34.600]  immigration out the kazoo and so the choice is do you vote for captain quint who's going to save
[02:47:34.600 --> 02:47:41.240]  your family or do you vote for the shark that's the choice you get to make and now we've got jerry
[02:47:41.240 --> 02:47:45.560]  fallwell jr as if the conspiracy was secret they said they were going to get trump we're going to
[02:47:45.560 --> 02:47:50.920]  sabotage even one hillary the horrible republicans the worst of the worst have resembled themselves
[02:47:50.920 --> 02:47:55.000]  have revealed themselves we got to get rid of them here is the jerry fallwell jr club
[02:47:55.960 --> 02:48:00.840]  well the whole story just fell in my lap about six or eight weeks ago i had a phone call from
[02:48:00.840 --> 02:48:08.440]  someone who's very close to the top establishment candidates and the republican party people who
[02:48:08.440 --> 02:48:13.960]  wanted to be a president over the last four or five years and he told me he said jerry something
[02:48:13.960 --> 02:48:20.600]  strange is going on they're meeting regularly and they're they tell me that it's a it's a certainty
[02:48:20.600 --> 02:48:27.080]  that donald trump will not be the nominee on november 8th of the republican party and i i called
[02:48:27.080 --> 02:48:31.240]  one of trump's attorneys i told him about it but there were no more details than that so there was
[02:48:31.240 --> 02:48:37.480]  nothing anybody could do but then when i saw what happened this weekend and i saw how quickly
[02:48:37.480 --> 02:48:44.200]  all the usual suspects jumped on it and started calling for trump to step down as the nominee
[02:48:44.200 --> 02:48:50.840]  the suspects who are the usual suspects paul ryan the establishment the establishment candidates
[02:48:50.840 --> 02:48:55.640]  he was he was wanting to just disinvited trump almost immediately it's almost like he knew it was
[02:48:55.640 --> 02:49:02.280]  coming i are these people who was are associated with the r and c uh with the leadership on
[02:49:02.280 --> 02:49:10.520]  capitol hill by the senate of the house how high does it rise very high but not necessarily the
[02:49:10.520 --> 02:49:16.840]  people you just mentioned i think it's people who were candidates at um at some point in the last
[02:49:17.560 --> 02:49:22.920]  year or four years or five years and and so it's very high level let me
[02:49:25.320 --> 02:49:30.440]  it's the bush global crime syndicate that's hooked in with the communist chinese and the big banks

[02:54:09.280 --> 02:54:13.680]  Top story on brothersreports.com, CNN orders blackout on Clinton's son.
[02:54:13.680 --> 02:54:15.280]  Let's say Danny Williams isn't his son.
[02:54:15.280 --> 02:54:16.480]  I believe he is.
[02:54:16.480 --> 02:54:18.320]  Danny believes he is.
[02:54:18.320 --> 02:54:21.480]  I've been covering this 20-plus years, or maybe 20.
[02:54:21.480 --> 02:54:24.520]  I was on there about a year before I covered Danny Williams.
[02:54:24.520 --> 02:54:25.520]  Danny believes it.
[02:54:25.520 --> 02:54:26.520]  He looks like Bill Clinton.
[02:54:26.520 --> 02:54:27.520]  I'm talking to state police.
[02:54:27.520 --> 02:54:28.520]  This has gone on forever.
[02:54:28.520 --> 02:54:31.480]  It was a fake DNA test that never happened.
[02:54:31.480 --> 02:54:33.800]  That's been confirmed.
[02:54:33.800 --> 02:54:37.520]  And all I know is the Clintons have lied to us about everything, or health.
[02:54:37.520 --> 02:54:38.520]  You name it.
[02:54:38.520 --> 02:54:43.320]  CNN orders blackout on Clinton's son, just like they did on healthcare, just like they
[02:54:43.320 --> 02:54:52.120]  did on the healthcare penalties, and Obamacare, and gun control, and world government.
[02:54:52.120 --> 02:54:59.680]  And now here comes Donald Trump, who reads Drudge Every Day, and he goes and gives a
[02:54:59.680 --> 02:55:05.320]  big speech saying Hillary wants world government, unlimited immigration, ruled by corporations.
[02:55:05.320 --> 02:55:07.920]  That's all true under TPP.
[02:55:07.920 --> 02:55:11.760]  Where is the fault with Trump?
[02:55:11.760 --> 02:55:15.680]  Those review more collusion between state and Clinton campaign.
[02:55:15.680 --> 02:55:19.120]  While she's being investigated, she's running the Justice Department and the State Department.
[02:55:19.120 --> 02:55:25.640]  Meanwhile, in San Antonio, they're spraying Islamic, Islam, or died things on Christian
[02:55:25.640 --> 02:55:26.760]  churches.
[02:55:26.760 --> 02:55:31.360]  I mean, this is just getting ridiculous, and then I've got these stories right here.
[02:55:31.360 --> 02:55:34.240]  I mean, I read these stories, and I don't even know what to make of them.
[02:55:34.240 --> 02:55:35.240]  It's so crazy.
[02:55:35.240 --> 02:55:38.440]  Now, I'm going to say something right now.
[02:55:38.440 --> 02:55:42.800]  Russia has been on the right, because they have less than three military bases, like
[02:55:42.800 --> 02:55:43.800]  two and a half.
[02:55:43.800 --> 02:55:46.680]  They have like one cooling station, two military bases.
[02:55:46.680 --> 02:55:53.160]  They've not been offensive, but Russia's being tricked into offensive action, which will
[02:55:53.160 --> 02:55:55.320]  bankrupt Russia.
[02:55:55.320 --> 02:55:57.640]  Russia's announcing they're going to start putting, or looking at putting troops and
[02:55:57.640 --> 02:56:00.360]  missiles in Cuba, which I know our government's done on their border.
[02:56:00.360 --> 02:56:03.920]  It's reasonable, and troops in Latin America, that's going to actually, though, make Russia
[02:56:03.920 --> 02:56:10.400]  a real threat, and then, it's just like, I didn't want to war with Islam, but once they
[02:56:10.400 --> 02:56:12.240]  brought them here, I had to have the war.
[02:56:12.240 --> 02:56:15.520]  I'm not going to have every side of the globalist against Russia, because they're just trying
[02:56:15.520 --> 02:56:21.280]  to destroy my own country as well, but Russia should really back off, because it's not going
[02:56:21.280 --> 02:56:25.600]  to help Russia doing that, but whatever, Russia has the right to fight back, Russia military
[02:56:25.600 --> 02:56:31.520]  practicing martial law over nuclear war risk, that's infowars.com, Associated Press, Putin
[02:56:31.520 --> 02:56:35.600]  postpones visit to France, and diplomatic tensions.
[02:56:35.600 --> 02:56:41.800]  Russia tells foreign Russians living abroad, that's a story up right now, to get out of
[02:56:41.800 --> 02:56:44.000]  those countries and come back to Russia.
[02:56:44.000 --> 02:56:46.120]  I mean, this is getting crazy.
[02:56:46.120 --> 02:56:49.640]  I think I had that article pulled up, I can't see it now, maybe five-minute drudge.
[02:56:49.640 --> 02:56:53.240]  Russia considers opening military bases in Cuba, mentioned that in Latin America.
[02:56:53.240 --> 02:56:56.840]  Putin, we know destroyed Adenkonpo in Aleppo, Syria.
[02:56:56.840 --> 02:57:01.000]  We're concerned with the deterioration of Russian-American relations, Putin said, and
[02:57:01.000 --> 02:57:03.680]  they know it was our military order to do it.
[02:57:03.680 --> 02:57:07.600]  Arms dealer says administration made him safe, scapegoat on living and operation to protect
[02:57:07.600 --> 02:57:08.600]  Clinton.
[02:57:08.600 --> 02:57:13.360]  They blamed him for the weapons, Clinton got to Al-Qaeda, Pakistan spied, he protecting
[02:57:13.360 --> 02:57:15.320]  terrorists, journals, claims.
[02:57:15.320 --> 02:57:19.200]  But I had that one article I had print on, but I don't have it, it was the most important,
[02:57:19.200 --> 02:57:23.840]  I think it was Associated Press as well, where Russian self-farmers abroad, the other is
[02:57:23.840 --> 02:57:25.400]  that zero hedge has it.
[02:57:25.400 --> 02:57:29.520]  Russian government officials told to immediately bring back children studying abroad.
[02:57:29.520 --> 02:57:31.960]  That's the next step to ambassadors being pulled.
[02:57:31.960 --> 02:57:38.320]  And then you're not one second to midnight, the second hand is ticking into it.
[02:57:38.320 --> 02:57:42.760]  So I'm here battling about Danny Williams and the media and Obama talking about me.
[02:57:42.760 --> 02:57:44.000]  I don't care.
[02:57:44.000 --> 02:57:45.600]  Just stop starting World War III.
[02:57:45.600 --> 02:57:47.120]  And why would they start World War III?
[02:57:47.120 --> 02:57:49.520]  To economically cover up what they've done.
[02:57:49.520 --> 02:57:54.120]  When you have a world financial collapse, the elites always launch a war.
[02:57:54.120 --> 02:58:00.320]  It's globalist, robber baron, British empire, Rothschild, Rockefeller doctrine.
[02:58:00.320 --> 02:58:03.040]  When the stock market goes down, they take you to war.
[02:58:03.040 --> 02:58:05.520]  We should get Gerald Salienta on the next few days.
[02:58:05.520 --> 02:58:08.240]  Randall Ert, get ready for a severe fall in the stock market.
[02:58:08.240 --> 02:58:12.200]  HSBC says, I'll do five more minutes and hand the baton of the day of the night, but first,

[03:00:15.040 --> 03:00:20.040]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:20.040 --> 03:00:24.560]  All right, so the whole world is moving towards war.
[03:00:24.560 --> 03:00:25.560]  Stock markets are melting down.
[03:00:25.560 --> 03:00:31.240]  As we told you about seven months ago, Deutsche Bank is going to go bigger belly up than Lehman
[03:00:31.240 --> 03:00:33.960]  Brothers in 2007.
[03:00:33.960 --> 03:00:38.480]  Business Insider reports a red alert get ready for a severe fall that's a quote in the stock
[03:00:38.480 --> 03:00:39.480]  market.
[03:00:39.480 --> 03:00:45.440]  HSBC says HSBC technical analysts, they signal that to cause the plunge.
[03:00:45.440 --> 03:00:48.640]  That's one of the ultimate warning signal.
[03:00:48.640 --> 03:00:52.680]  A note to clients released Wednesday.
[03:00:52.680 --> 03:00:58.920]  Murray Gunn, the head of technical analysts for HSBC said he had become a red alert for
[03:00:58.920 --> 03:01:06.240]  an immediate sell off of stocks given the price action over the past few weeks.
[03:01:06.240 --> 03:01:12.080]  Over six weeks ago, we saw similar headlines.
[03:01:12.080 --> 03:01:17.080]  Remember eight months ago, Royal Bank of Scotland sell everything you've got in this paper.
[03:01:17.080 --> 03:01:20.920]  That's the establishment saying that.
[03:01:20.920 --> 03:01:23.800]  Almost made me want to buy things, but here's what they know.
[03:01:23.800 --> 03:01:27.960]  They want to look like the winners when it all starts going belly up.
[03:01:27.960 --> 03:01:31.960]  Basically every major financial institution says this is the season we're in.
[03:01:31.960 --> 03:01:37.360]  When the Russians are getting their diplomatic families out of the West, they're canceling
[03:01:37.360 --> 03:01:40.040]  diplomatic meetings with heads of state.
[03:01:40.040 --> 03:01:47.000]  They're doing 40 million nuclear warfare evacuation drills and saying it's for nuclear
[03:01:47.000 --> 03:01:48.000]  war.
[03:01:48.000 --> 03:01:51.920]  And the United States control of the globalist has moved nuclear missiles right up to the
[03:01:51.920 --> 03:01:54.040]  border with Russia.
[03:01:54.040 --> 03:01:55.040]  And Russia says, what do we do?
[03:01:55.040 --> 03:01:59.160]  I guess we move missiles into Cuba.
[03:01:59.160 --> 03:02:02.520]  And we've got a government that wants our military to wear high heels and wants to have
[03:02:02.520 --> 03:02:05.360]  trainees as our top commandos.
[03:02:05.360 --> 03:02:09.880]  Not to be nice to trainees, folks, but to sabotage the country and have us all in fighting about
[03:02:09.880 --> 03:02:11.560]  a man to dress.
[03:02:11.560 --> 03:02:17.840]  Supposedly in high heels going to storm a machine gun nest while we're debating that.
[03:02:17.840 --> 03:02:20.560]  The globalists are about to bring down the whole world.
[03:02:20.560 --> 03:02:22.320]  They're moving into their bunkers.
[03:02:22.320 --> 03:02:27.680]  I hope this can all be averted, but a telltale sign was two years ago.
[03:02:27.680 --> 03:02:31.960]  This is all confirmed when they just said, let anybody in any China, Middle East, Asia,
[03:02:31.960 --> 03:02:36.800]  Eastern Europe, Latin America, we don't care if they have tuberculosis, this drug immune.
[03:02:36.800 --> 03:02:39.000]  It's a death sentence for thousands.
[03:02:39.000 --> 03:02:43.800]  Each person you let them with that is thousands that are going to get it hundreds will die.
[03:02:43.800 --> 03:02:50.600]  The plague, the black plague, bubonic plague, leprosy, it's all back.
[03:02:50.600 --> 03:02:51.600]  And it's not like they just let them in.
[03:02:51.600 --> 03:02:53.160]  They don't like, oh, you're here with leprosy.
[03:02:53.160 --> 03:02:54.160]  Let's treat you right here with TB.
[03:02:54.160 --> 03:02:57.320]  No, you go, oh, just come on in.
[03:02:57.320 --> 03:03:02.240]  You sit back and go, what's the strategy there?
[03:03:02.240 --> 03:03:08.760]  One thing, collapse the country.
[03:03:08.760 --> 03:03:11.440]  One thing that hit me a few weeks ago.
[03:03:11.440 --> 03:03:15.520]  I mean, I'm not stupid, but sometimes the problems are too obvious to get right away.
[03:03:15.520 --> 03:03:22.520]  You know, it's the easier problems that are hard to equate to deduce, to complete, to
[03:03:22.520 --> 03:03:23.520]  transact.
[03:03:23.520 --> 03:03:28.800]  That's the right word for doing a math problem, complete, I guess.
[03:03:28.800 --> 03:03:33.120]  They're calling everybody that's against global government, world government, looting,
[03:03:33.120 --> 03:03:34.400]  corruption, a Russian agent.
[03:03:34.400 --> 03:03:38.680]  Because Russia is just one country trying to crawl out of this, and that's because they're
[03:03:38.680 --> 03:03:45.120]  going to have a war with Russia and arrest everybody who's their opposition, my God.
[03:03:45.120 --> 03:03:50.640]  The problem is you ran this equation in 1917 with a disarmed surf population in Russia.
[03:03:50.640 --> 03:03:54.680]  You run in other countries, like China with a disarmed surf population.
[03:03:54.680 --> 03:03:59.400]  You're going to run this in the most armed camp in the world with all the ancestral memory
[03:03:59.400 --> 03:04:00.640]  to fight you.
[03:04:00.640 --> 03:04:10.200]  You take our current weakness and malaise as a sign of weakness, huh, okay, if it's what
[03:04:10.200 --> 03:04:17.080]  you want, your figurehead can hardly walk, if it's what all you people think you're
[03:04:17.080 --> 03:04:22.120]  God's because you got little fake, ironic glasses and you look like Rachel Maddow and
[03:04:22.120 --> 03:04:26.480]  everybody's asexual, so you went to a cool college and you all told each other how smart
[03:04:26.480 --> 03:04:32.080]  you were, so you think you're going to win a civil war with us.
[03:04:32.080 --> 03:04:33.080]  I'm just going to step aside.
[03:04:33.080 --> 03:04:39.440]  I've already done my work at that point, good luck, I'll have to tell you, I'll be staying
[03:04:39.440 --> 03:04:46.400]  out of the way, but you won't have a prayer.
[03:04:46.400 --> 03:04:49.920]  No, it won't even matter, your elites won't even protect you anyways, there's no honor
[03:04:49.920 --> 03:04:50.920]  among thieves.
[03:04:50.920 --> 03:04:53.960]  Please support the broadcast, spread the word, it's one of a kind, thank you for all your
[03:04:53.960 --> 03:04:54.960]  support.
[03:04:54.960 --> 03:05:00.000]  David Knight is coming in for a fresh 55 minutes of transmission starting now.
[03:05:00.000 --> 03:05:04.400]  There's an unprecedented crackdown underway against Christians worshiping in secret in
[03:05:04.400 --> 03:05:05.400]  Iran.
[03:05:05.400 --> 03:05:08.920]  Iranian police interfamily parties and weddings in an effort to find those who've turned
[03:05:08.920 --> 03:05:10.680]  their backs on Islam.
[03:05:10.680 --> 03:05:14.920]  Iranian Christian news source Mojaveh News reports that a house raid on September 30th
[03:05:14.920 --> 03:05:19.160]  resulted in the arrest of five men who were taken to an unknown location and charged with
[03:05:19.160 --> 03:05:22.040]  evangelism, a crime that could mean death in Iran.
[03:05:22.040 --> 03:05:26.280]  In a 2016 report, the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom said that
[03:05:26.280 --> 03:05:31.280]  Christians and other minorities in Iran continue to experience severe human rights abuses.
[03:05:31.280 --> 03:05:35.640]  This news comes as the Obama administration breaks yet another promise to Americans concerning
[03:05:35.640 --> 03:05:36.640]  the Iran deal.
[03:05:36.640 --> 03:05:41.080]  The latest betrayal, the Treasury Department just lifted key restrictions on Iran's ability
[03:05:41.080 --> 03:05:45.120]  to do business and U.S. dollars and access world financial markets.
[03:05:45.120 --> 03:05:49.520]  If you recall, Iran's banks weren't cut off from the U.S. financial system over the nuclear
[03:05:49.520 --> 03:05:54.600]  issue but over Tehran's funding of terrorism, its religious aggression, and so on.
[03:05:54.600 --> 03:05:56.440]  The President has changed all that.
[03:05:56.440 --> 03:06:25.440]  I'm Margaret Hall reporting for Infowars.com.

[03:07:35.720 --> 03:07:39.680]  In short, the major media is being covertly manipulated by well-financed political forces
[03:07:39.680 --> 03:07:43.960]  who are trying to sway public opinion in a natural direction that only serves establishment
[03:07:43.960 --> 03:07:44.960]  agendas.

[03:07:55.080 --> 03:08:10.080]  of being spoon fed lives by the mainstream media.
[03:08:10.080 --> 03:08:26.680]  Welcome back to the Fourth Hour of the Alex Jones broadcast.
[03:08:26.680 --> 03:08:30.280]  I'm David Knight on this Wednesday, October 12, 2016.
[03:08:30.280 --> 03:08:32.680]  We've got a lot of news to cover here.
[03:08:32.680 --> 03:08:37.480]  Donald Trump really broke down what's behind Hillary Clinton's world government based
[03:08:37.480 --> 03:08:42.720]  on these emails that have been leaked from John Podesta, her campaign manager, and comments
[03:08:42.720 --> 03:08:46.000]  that have been made at the speeches that she's given to these various banks.
[03:08:46.000 --> 03:08:52.560]  We now know and we have a document that tells you she knows exactly the method that she's
[03:08:52.560 --> 03:08:56.120]  going to enact world government and she defines what world government is.
[03:08:56.120 --> 03:09:01.400]  And Donald Trump broke that down for a massive group of supporters yesterday, over 8,000
[03:09:01.400 --> 03:09:03.200]  people that he was speaking to.
[03:09:03.200 --> 03:09:04.440]  We're gonna talk about that in a moment.
[03:09:04.440 --> 03:09:09.920]  We're gonna talk about the femme dims, which is what I call them, the feminist Democrats,
[03:09:09.920 --> 03:09:15.760]  who are really nothing more than the hateful left as they go out and attack rape victims.
[03:09:15.760 --> 03:09:17.680]  We see this throughout the media as well.
[03:09:17.680 --> 03:09:21.600]  But before we get into that, I saw this couple of articles on the Dredge Report.
[03:09:21.600 --> 03:09:24.520]  I think he put these things right next to each other.
[03:09:24.520 --> 03:09:26.560]  Listen to these two headlines.
[03:09:26.560 --> 03:09:32.480]  World astrologists gather to predict the president and then more dead voters and fraud cases
[03:09:32.480 --> 03:09:34.660]  discovered in Colorado.
[03:09:34.660 --> 03:09:40.760]  So I guess the question is, are CNN and Fox News gonna start having seances to pull the
[03:09:40.760 --> 03:09:42.040]  dead?
[03:09:42.040 --> 03:09:44.920]  Because that's the situation we're in with voter fraud.
[03:09:44.920 --> 03:09:49.600]  They are, it's not just in Colorado, but we're seeing this a lot in Virginia.
[03:09:49.600 --> 03:09:51.560]  We've had a couple of different articles.
[03:09:51.560 --> 03:09:56.880]  One particular county where they, one person who was working in the county office, noticed
[03:09:56.880 --> 03:10:00.680]  a name that was going by there that was a deceased judge and said, wait a minute.
[03:10:00.680 --> 03:10:03.320]  I know that guy and he's dead.
[03:10:03.320 --> 03:10:05.080]  And he's now registering to vote.
[03:10:05.080 --> 03:10:06.080]  What's going on with this?
[03:10:06.080 --> 03:10:07.080]  So they started looking at it carefully.
[03:10:07.080 --> 03:10:11.240]  They saw a whole bunch of people there and then we've seen thousands show up in another
[03:10:11.240 --> 03:10:16.920]  area of Virginia and that's only one small area of Virginia and that's only one state.
[03:10:16.920 --> 03:10:24.400]  And as I've pointed out before, I know from secondhand information, a friend of my brother-in-law
[03:10:24.400 --> 03:10:28.600]  who in the last election, 2012, went in to vote and they said you've already voted.
[03:10:28.600 --> 03:10:31.520]  As you know in North Carolina, there's no voter ID.
[03:10:31.520 --> 03:10:32.680]  You can't have a picture ID.
[03:10:32.680 --> 03:10:33.680]  They can't ask for it.
[03:10:33.680 --> 03:10:37.040]  All you do is go in and give them a name and an address and you can vote.
[03:10:37.040 --> 03:10:40.040]  And so they said, you voted and so has this other person at your address.
[03:10:40.040 --> 03:10:42.240]  He says, well, that's my mother.
[03:10:42.240 --> 03:10:43.560]  She's been dead for a couple of years.
[03:10:43.560 --> 03:10:48.160]  So somebody had already gone in and voted for him and for his mother by the time it came
[03:10:48.160 --> 03:10:53.760]  to election day because North Carolina starts voting earlier than any other state in the
[03:10:53.760 --> 03:10:54.760]  nation.
[03:10:54.760 --> 03:10:57.040]  So North Carolina was run for a very long time by the Democrats.
[03:10:57.040 --> 03:11:01.400]  It was only recently the Republicans have taken over and they've tried to reform this
[03:11:01.400 --> 03:11:06.600]  drawn out election process, the easy voter registration, the lack of voter ID.
[03:11:06.600 --> 03:11:08.240]  They've tried to address that.
[03:11:08.240 --> 03:11:14.200]  But every time they say, we're going to look at voter ID, then they come in after them
[03:11:14.200 --> 03:11:18.440]  and they say, no, no, no, you're not going to do that.
[03:11:18.440 --> 03:11:22.960]  That's racist to ask for ID, even though you have to show ID everywhere.
[03:11:22.960 --> 03:11:28.080]  So these two articles, one of them is an investigation by CBS in Colorado.
[03:11:28.080 --> 03:11:31.400]  The person who was looking at it, the county clerk's office says, well, I don't think it
[03:11:31.400 --> 03:11:32.400]  was an accident.
[03:11:32.400 --> 03:11:38.120]  This is part of an investigation done by CBS entitled Dying to Vote.
[03:11:38.120 --> 03:11:40.920]  That's the way it breaks out.
[03:11:40.920 --> 03:11:45.280]  And then the Guardian story, astrologers are predicting the election.
[03:11:45.280 --> 03:11:49.240]  Dozens of astrologers are coming together to predict who will be president.
[03:11:49.240 --> 03:11:54.120]  So I guess we're next, we're going to see Frank Lunds in with an astrologer and they're
[03:11:54.120 --> 03:11:59.520]  going to be actually doing a Ouija board or whatever to figure out how these dead voters
[03:11:59.520 --> 03:12:01.800]  are going to be voting.
[03:12:01.800 --> 03:12:06.840]  Because that's just as scientific as their polls, isn't it?
[03:12:06.840 --> 03:12:10.680]  When you've got polls, they tell you the margin of error is four points and you get one poll
[03:12:10.680 --> 03:12:15.320]  after the other that are eight points apart or 12 points apart.
[03:12:15.320 --> 03:12:22.320]  You can't even take the two and add them up and get the margin of error so far apart.
[03:12:22.320 --> 03:12:27.200]  When they're heavily skewing it towards Democrat voters, far more than the difference between
[03:12:27.200 --> 03:12:29.920]  registered Democrats and registered Republicans.
[03:12:29.920 --> 03:12:35.520]  When they don't take into consideration the people who are coming into the election process
[03:12:35.520 --> 03:12:40.560]  who haven't voted for many, many years, if ever because they've been totally fed up with
[03:12:40.560 --> 03:12:44.160]  these controlled opposition parties.
[03:12:44.160 --> 03:12:48.440]  The Bushes and the Clintons illustrate for us all how there really isn't two different
[03:12:48.440 --> 03:12:50.520]  parties or hasn't really been a choice.
[03:12:50.520 --> 03:12:55.560]  It's simply been the American League versus the National League or the AFC versus the
[03:12:55.560 --> 03:12:56.560]  NFC.
[03:12:56.560 --> 03:13:00.800]  They're all playing for the same owners and it's just phony opposition.
[03:13:00.800 --> 03:13:05.280]  It is a game, it is a game and there is some benefit for the people who win, just like
[03:13:05.280 --> 03:13:07.400]  there's a benefit for the team that wins the Super Bowl.
[03:13:07.400 --> 03:13:12.760]  But you have to understand they are still going to be controlled, they've got other
[03:13:12.760 --> 03:13:16.040]  people who are making the rules, they're going to follow those rules.
[03:13:16.040 --> 03:13:20.680]  They're just the faces of this global governance that's there.
[03:13:20.680 --> 03:13:25.660]  And I think that when we look at some of these remarks that came out, the speeches that Hillary
[03:13:25.660 --> 03:13:30.440]  Clinton was making to these various banking groups for which she was getting about a quarter
[03:13:30.440 --> 03:13:37.040]  of a million dollars a piece, for which she earned tens of millions of dollars.
[03:13:37.040 --> 03:13:41.120]  Essentially going to these people and saying, I know precisely what you want, we're on the
[03:13:41.120 --> 03:13:46.520]  same page, give me the money, put me in office, I'll make it happen.
[03:13:46.520 --> 03:13:50.640]  And we look at this one particular comment here and Donald Trump, I won't tell you what
[03:13:50.640 --> 03:13:54.600]  Donald Trump did to unpack this for his audience because we've talked about this before.
[03:13:54.600 --> 03:14:00.480]  Here's the quote, my dream, she said to a group of bankers, is a hemispheric common
[03:14:00.480 --> 03:14:05.640]  market with open trade and open borders sometime in the future.
[03:14:05.640 --> 03:14:09.840]  With energy that's as green and sustainable as we can get it, powering growth and opportunity
[03:14:09.840 --> 03:14:12.760]  for every person in the hemisphere.
[03:14:12.760 --> 03:14:18.440]  Now I've said many times and we've all said here at infowars.com, there's three different
[03:14:18.440 --> 03:14:23.040]  approaches that they're going to take in order to create a global governance.
[03:14:23.040 --> 03:14:30.280]  First of all, you get rid of the borders and you homogenize the people in one sense to
[03:14:30.280 --> 03:14:31.400]  a third world level.
[03:14:31.400 --> 03:14:35.360]  You create different, bring in different groups that aren't going to assimilate.
[03:14:35.360 --> 03:14:39.600]  That's one of the ways that you destroy the national culture.
[03:14:39.600 --> 03:14:44.240]  And so what they're trying to do is homogenize on a international level, make all the countries
[03:14:44.240 --> 03:14:48.960]  the same, create conflict with groups that will not assimilate like the massive groups
[03:14:48.960 --> 03:14:50.680]  of Muslims that come in.
[03:14:50.680 --> 03:14:54.280]  So that's one part of it, the open borders, okay, and we can see that with the policies
[03:14:54.280 --> 03:15:00.120]  like the dreamer policies and the fact that they go apoplectic, even the libertarian candidate
[03:15:00.120 --> 03:15:04.120]  Gary Johnson freaking out when people use the term illegal immigrants.
[03:15:04.120 --> 03:15:09.000]  No, no, no, there's no such thing as illegals and we got Nancy Pelosi saying we don't have
[03:15:09.000 --> 03:15:10.000]  borders.
[03:15:10.000 --> 03:15:13.120]  We just have one people with a line running through us.
[03:15:13.120 --> 03:15:17.200]  It's no different than the border between, let's say, Oklahoma and Texas because in
[03:15:17.200 --> 03:15:22.120]  their mind, they have already created a hemispheric common market.
[03:15:22.120 --> 03:15:25.360]  She's just acknowledging what they've been working for for a long time.
[03:15:25.360 --> 03:15:27.040]  NAFTA was the first part of it.
[03:15:27.040 --> 03:15:31.800]  First you create economic consolidation and economic management.
[03:15:31.800 --> 03:15:38.120]  And then what you do is you create political consolidation, okay?
[03:15:38.120 --> 03:15:42.640]  And that's what's happening with this.
[03:15:42.640 --> 03:15:48.520]  The open borders are part of this and the other part of it is what they call open trade
[03:15:48.520 --> 03:15:50.160]  or free trade.
[03:15:50.160 --> 03:15:55.200]  That really is not free trade, it's really managed trade and we've talked about that
[03:15:55.200 --> 03:15:56.200]  as well.
[03:15:56.200 --> 03:16:02.480]  That's what TPP and the TTIP, the Transatlantic, the Trans-Pacific Partnerships, they don't
[03:16:02.480 --> 03:16:04.440]  even call them trade agreements anymore.
[03:16:04.440 --> 03:16:07.040]  NAFTA was a treaty.
[03:16:07.040 --> 03:16:08.040]  They don't call it a treaty.
[03:16:08.040 --> 03:16:09.560]  They don't call it a trade agreement.
[03:16:09.560 --> 03:16:10.560]  But it was a treaty.
[03:16:10.560 --> 03:16:16.080]  TPP is a treaty, so is TTIP, those are both treaties.
[03:16:16.080 --> 03:16:20.840]  And yet the reality is, is that they want to call them something other than a treaty
[03:16:20.840 --> 03:16:25.040]  so they don't have to follow the constitutional process for ratifying a treaty.
[03:16:25.040 --> 03:16:28.720]  But you have to understand this isn't about free trade, it's not about open trade.
[03:16:28.720 --> 03:16:33.960]  This is about having our economy managed by a committee, an international committee
[03:16:33.960 --> 03:16:37.800]  that is not elected, that is not accountable to anyone, okay?
[03:16:37.800 --> 03:16:42.200]  This is worse than the central planning committee of the communist countries that would get
[03:16:42.200 --> 03:16:46.240]  together and do the economic planning with a five-year plan.
[03:16:46.240 --> 03:16:49.880]  This is precisely how these trade agreements were created in the first place.
[03:16:49.880 --> 03:16:54.640]  And as Senator Sessions pointed out, the only senator to go in and really read and study
[03:16:54.640 --> 03:16:59.800]  and analyze and present what these treaties were about, it is a living document.
[03:16:59.800 --> 03:17:05.480]  It creates a committee that can by fiat change anything in it, including the people who are
[03:17:05.480 --> 03:17:06.480]  included in it.
[03:17:06.480 --> 03:17:07.480]  They can bring in China.
[03:17:07.480 --> 03:17:09.680]  People work against China.
[03:17:09.680 --> 03:17:14.480]  And as Jeff Sessions pointed out, they are going to be managing our economy.
[03:17:14.480 --> 03:17:16.400]  Nobody is going to be electing these people.
[03:17:16.400 --> 03:17:18.120]  How do they get appointed?
[03:17:18.120 --> 03:17:19.120]  Ask yourself.
[03:17:19.120 --> 03:17:22.240]  Well, ask yourself, who wrote these agreements?
[03:17:22.240 --> 03:17:26.120]  Your elected representatives in every one of these countries affected, not just in America,
[03:17:26.120 --> 03:17:27.960]  but all of the countries.
[03:17:27.960 --> 03:17:31.840]  The elected representatives couldn't even look at this stuff.
[03:17:31.840 --> 03:17:36.400]  And then they're told afterwards, and these are the people, Paul Ryan, Mitch McConnell,
[03:17:36.400 --> 03:17:40.200]  all these people who are dumping on Trump, who say they can't support him.
[03:17:40.200 --> 03:17:42.000]  They're not going to do anything to help him.
[03:17:42.000 --> 03:17:44.200]  They're not supporting America.
[03:17:44.200 --> 03:17:49.160]  These are the same people who, after they were hand-delivered this agreement that was
[03:17:49.160 --> 03:17:54.320]  created by a few multinational corporations' lobbyists, they said, we're going to ram
[03:17:54.320 --> 03:18:00.760]  this thing through without any kind of debate, without filibuster, without delay.
[03:18:00.760 --> 03:18:04.720]  It's going, once they present this thing, it's going to run through in 20 days.
[03:18:04.720 --> 03:18:08.600]  There will be no amendments, no debate about any of this stuff.
[03:18:08.600 --> 03:18:11.840]  It's just going to be a straight-up and down vote, and it's going to be a majority vote,
[03:18:11.840 --> 03:18:14.880]  not a two-thirds vote like is required in the Constitution.
[03:18:14.880 --> 03:18:16.400]  So we have the open borders.
[03:18:16.400 --> 03:18:22.480]  We have the so-called open trade, which is globalist management of your economy.
[03:18:22.480 --> 03:18:26.440]  And then we have the sustainable aspect, the climate treaty.
[03:18:26.440 --> 03:18:28.400]  This is what Hillary Clinton finishes up with.
[03:18:28.400 --> 03:18:31.080]  Oh, we're going to be green and sustainable.
[03:18:31.080 --> 03:18:37.560]  You understand, that is perhaps the most powerful aspect of global governance.
[03:18:37.560 --> 03:18:42.200]  Look at the UN agenda for 2030 of sustainable development, okay?
[03:18:42.200 --> 03:18:48.280]  What they're talking about there is essentially creating a global tax that is going to fund
[03:18:48.280 --> 03:18:49.880]  a global governance.
[03:18:49.880 --> 03:18:54.520]  You have to have a global problem that a global government is going to address.
[03:18:54.520 --> 03:19:01.080]  So they invented climate change, and then they invented a crony capitalist system to
[03:19:01.080 --> 03:19:06.320]  do this, which is also a tax, which will fund this global governance by these multinational
[03:19:06.320 --> 03:19:09.280]  corporations that are writing these treaties.
[03:19:09.280 --> 03:19:12.360]  All three of those things are right there in Hillary Clinton's remarks.
[03:19:12.360 --> 03:19:14.840]  Now here's the way Donald Trump broke it down yesterday.
[03:19:14.840 --> 03:19:19.040]  First of all, he said, we have to investigate Hillary Clinton, and we have to investigate
[03:19:19.040 --> 03:19:20.040]  the investigation.
[03:19:20.040 --> 03:19:26.280]  In other words, we're going to find out, and he knows that Comey and Lynch were coordinating
[03:19:26.280 --> 03:19:29.440]  with the Clinton campaign.
[03:19:29.440 --> 03:19:32.640]  We see now more emails confirming that, but we told you that before.
[03:19:32.640 --> 03:19:36.720]  We told you about the relationship between Comey and Lynch.
[03:19:36.720 --> 03:19:41.360]  That's been going on for a long time, that they let Sandy Berger get away with destroying
[03:19:41.360 --> 03:19:45.840]  national security documents and a cover-up, that they've been working together and for
[03:19:45.840 --> 03:19:47.840]  the Clintons for a very long time, those two people.
[03:19:47.840 --> 03:19:52.360]  When we come back, we're going to break down Donald Trump's remarks about global governance.
[03:19:52.360 --> 03:19:54.800]  He nailed it precisely with this crowd last night.
[03:19:54.800 --> 03:20:24.720]  We'll be right back.
[03:20:24.720 --> 03:20:53.840]  We're going to break down Donald Trump's remarks, and we're going to break down
[03:20:53.840 --> 03:21:23.680]  Donald Trump's remarks, and we're going to break down Donald Trump's remarks, and we're
