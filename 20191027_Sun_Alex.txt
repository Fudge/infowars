[00:00.000 --> 00:04.740]  Gavin McInnis is back with his all-new online network, FreeSpeech.tv.
[00:04.740 --> 00:26.040]  Gavin McInnis, Joe Biggs, Miley Unopolis, and Sof, all at FreeSpeech.tv.
[00:26.040 --> 00:37.380]  Today is the day for the globalist across the planet. Humanity is awakening to the corporate tyranny and the globalist alliance with communist China.
[00:37.380 --> 00:53.140]  Patriots have elected presidents and prime ministers and other key leaders to positions from Brazil to Germany, from Russia to Japan, and the fight against the New World Order.
[00:53.140 --> 00:59.680]  But the powerful mega banks, who stole the trillions of dollars they now control, are fighting back.
[00:59.680 --> 01:08.880]  Thank you for joining us, ladies and gentlemen, on this October 27, 2019 worldwide transmission. I am your host, Alex Jones.
[01:08.880 --> 01:22.980]  It has been said many times that if Trump came out with the cure for cancer, mainstream enemy of the people, corporate media, would say that that was a bad thing.
[01:22.980 --> 01:35.980]  Well, Obama and Hillary, in Trump's own words, it's true. Senator Paul's exposed it. Senator Cruz's exposed it. The Pentagon's exposed it.
[01:35.980 --> 01:48.280]  Obama and Hillary were the co-founders of ISIS. That was just a collection of al-Qaeda, Wahhabi, Saudi Arabian funded, taking over Syria, and an invasion launched eight years ago.
[01:48.280 --> 01:54.680]  And Trump, along with the Russians and others, our own military, have removed them.
[01:54.680 --> 01:59.780]  And the deep state is very upset that their precious Islamic State is in trouble.
[01:59.780 --> 02:11.380]  So, al-Baghdadi, the leader of ISIS, is killed yesterday. We learned about this morning. He's killed in northern Syria.
[02:11.380 --> 02:21.580]  And we have a compilation we're putting together right now. It's up on infowars.com. A bunch of clips we're putting together right now. We'll have an end of next segment.
[02:21.580 --> 02:40.280]  Openly decrying it and saying Trump's bad, and the Washington Post wrote an editorial piece, or an obituary, praising al-Baghdadi.
[02:40.280 --> 02:54.880]  I'm telling you, folks, the globalists hate America. And their entire team is made up of a collection of groups and organizations sworn to destroy us because of our Christian ethos they fear could return.
[02:54.880 --> 03:01.880]  Like a typhoon smashing their systems. Let's play a few clips of the president talking about this today.
[03:01.880 --> 03:17.280]  Last night was a great night for the United States and for the world. A brutal killer, one who has caused so much hardship and death, has violently been eliminated.
[03:17.280 --> 03:36.880]  He will never again harm another innocent man, woman, or child. He died like a dog. He died like a coward. The world is now a much safer place. God bless America. Thank you.
[03:36.880 --> 03:52.980]  I want to thank the soldiers and sailors, airmen, and Marines involved in last night's operation. You are the very best there is anywhere in the world. No matter where you go, there is nobody even close.
[03:52.980 --> 04:13.080]  I want to thank General Mark Milley and our Joint Chiefs of Staff. And I also want to thank our professionals who work in other agencies of the United States government and were critical to the mission's unbelievable success.
[04:13.080 --> 04:34.980]  Last night the United States brought the world's number one terrorist leader to justice. Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi is dead. He was the founder and leader of ISIS, the most ruthless and violent terror organization anywhere in the world.
[04:34.980 --> 04:49.580]  The United States has been searching for Baghdadi for many years. Capturing or killing Baghdadi has been the top national security priority of my administration.
[04:49.580 --> 05:07.680]  U.S. Special Operations Forces executed a dangerous and daring nighttime raid in northwestern Syria and accomplished their mission in grand style. The U.S. personnel, we'll be right back.
[05:07.680 --> 05:35.280]  Welcome back to NPR here today. I'm Wilbur Snakeland. I just want you to know that when you hear the intro of the show and it's the Rockefeller Foundation and the Carnegie Foundation, don't look into the 1920s and 30s documents where they said that to be free from war we must end the family and masculinity and that we must put chemicals in the food and water to make the men subservient and the women infertile.
[05:35.280 --> 06:04.280]  A real terrorist, Alex Jones, has been on air with that gravely evil male voice telling you to look into how iodine's good for your body and essential and how fluoride's bad. Listen, that's a conspiracy theory, okay? There's no medical journals. There's no facts. You need fluoride. Just drink extra fluoride and then you don't have to think anymore and just go to sleep when I talk to you real soft like this.
[06:04.280 --> 06:06.280]  Thank you.
[06:34.280 --> 06:41.280]  This is Alex Jones.
[06:41.280 --> 07:03.280]  Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the leader of ISIS, put in charge of Syria by Obama and Hillary, got killed last night and the entire corporate enemy of the American people media is now viciously attacking the president and praising him as a scholar, as a saint. I'm not kidding. These are words they used in the Washington Post.
[07:03.280 --> 07:28.280]  Ladies and gentlemen, the globalists are taking their masks off. Here's some of the footage of the raid as they destroyed the compound he was in before going in and identifying with that body.
[07:28.280 --> 07:34.280]  And more of that coming up. It's all on infowars.com and newswars.com. Here are the headlines.
[07:34.280 --> 07:41.280]  Trump approved special ops raid targeting ISIS leader Bakr al-Baghdadi. Military says he's dead.
[07:41.280 --> 07:46.280]  Compilation media, Democrats bash Trump over killing of ISIS leader.
[07:46.280 --> 08:02.280]  Infowars.com. There's like seven different clips. We're putting them together right now. We'll be playing them either at the end of this segment or next segment.
[08:02.280 --> 08:11.280]  Washington Post honors ISIS leader al-Baghdadi as religious scholar in obituary, called him pious and dedicated.
[08:11.280 --> 08:19.280]  I mean, this is just sick. Trump says he did notify Congress of Bakr al-Baghdadi raid out of fears for leaks.
[08:19.280 --> 08:28.280]  Remember, two years ago, some of those special forces raids and ISIS was waiting, turned out, leftist inside the CIA. We're leaking it. Told you.
[08:28.280 --> 08:38.280]  Again, it's all up on infowars.com, MSNBC, NBC bemoans Trump, taking victory lap, killing ISIS leader, didn't take a victory lap.
[08:38.280 --> 08:45.280]  He said, good job, the military. But is he supposed to say nothing happened? Not tell anybody?
[08:45.280 --> 08:51.280]  He was being left. Bakr al-Baghdadi was being left alone by the globalist and others in that area of Syria.
[08:51.280 --> 08:56.280]  Trump has stepped aside and had him destroyed.
[08:56.280 --> 09:03.280]  He's ending what Obama and Hillary started. They're on record creating ISIS with Saudi Arabia and launching those attacks.
[09:03.280 --> 09:12.280]  Trump staged a coup operation inside Saudi Arabia last year and removed the ISIS al-Qaeda backers and told Saudi Arabia,
[09:12.280 --> 09:18.280]  if you do it again, I'm going to kill the leader of Saudi Arabia. We're going to remove you.
[09:18.280 --> 09:39.280]  And they jumped and clicked their heels and said, yes, sir, because the globalist puts Saudi Arabia in power. The British Empire did 90 years ago, officially in 1931.
[09:39.280 --> 09:48.280]  But they were set up by about 1905 as an army to take over the Middle East. And all of that's being ended. All of that's being deconstructed right now.
[09:48.280 --> 09:57.280]  So we're going to play these clips. We're going to break it all down for you today. Folks have said if Trump found a cure for cancer,
[09:57.280 --> 10:08.280]  people would be mad at him and say that he was a bad guy. If Trump found a leprechaun that crapped gold cuff links for everybody, the left would say it was terrible.
[10:08.280 --> 10:17.280]  In fact, there's the meme. Trump cures cancer. Curing cancer is racist. We have the right to die from cancer. Democrats are outraged.
[10:17.280 --> 10:24.280]  You joke about this stuff, but they're really angry. I mean, I was saying two and a half years ago, they're trying to crash the economy.
[10:24.280 --> 10:31.280]  The Federal Reserve is raising interest rates when they never did under Obama to kill the recovery so people don't vote for Trump in the midterms.
[10:31.280 --> 10:42.280]  Don't vote for Republicans coming up in the midterms than Trump in 2020. Now the Democrats admitted on TV, Pelosi, all of them, Chuck Schumer, Bill Maher.
[10:42.280 --> 10:51.280]  They admit they're trying to plunge the economy so you don't like Trump and don't like Americana. It's incredible.
[10:51.280 --> 11:01.280]  So Al-Baghdadi gets killed and wait till we play these clips. Susan Rice, all of them. It's amazing. Now there's Maher.
[11:01.280 --> 11:10.280]  I'm hoping for a crashing economy so we can get rid of Trump. Bring on the recession. This is for a guy worth over $100 million.
[11:10.280 --> 11:16.280]  But hey, he's not the worst of the left. At least he supports free speech and has defended me. Guess who else came out?
[11:16.280 --> 11:23.280]  I talked about Info Wars. Kanye West. I know Kanye's a listener. We've almost got him on the show, but his security stopped him from it.
[11:23.280 --> 11:27.280]  You know, they threw him in a mental institution when he voted for Trump for two weeks.
[11:27.280 --> 11:32.280]  And the guy's far familiar. Very talented. And we're very close to getting Kanye West on the show. I can tell you that.
[11:32.280 --> 11:41.280]  But he did come out and talk about going Alex Jones level. So that clip is going to be coming up a little bit later to show how the Info War is really breaking out there.
[11:41.280 --> 11:48.280]  I don't know that it's like the Voldemort word to use it, but the good Voldemort. It's the name you're not supposed to use.
[11:48.280 --> 11:52.280]  So everybody's using it now.
[11:52.280 --> 11:57.280]  Coming up, Beto O'Rourke said in Texas, he doesn't want to confiscate the guns. Just ban all the Simianos.
[11:57.280 --> 12:02.280]  Then he said, oh, I am going to confiscate him. Then he said, well, I don't mean you have to. Just please turn him in.
[12:02.280 --> 12:07.280]  Then he said he never said that. Well, now he's gone on TV again and said, we are coming door to door.
[12:07.280 --> 12:13.280]  And if you don't turn them in, we're going to kill you. That clip is coming up as well. It's up on InfoWars.com.
[12:13.280 --> 12:20.280]  All those years, we tried to explain that they want your guns. And once they register them, they'll take them. They've done it all over the world.
[12:20.280 --> 12:25.280]  And it was all those big national pieces that I'm lying. No one wants your guns.
[12:25.280 --> 12:32.280]  When everywhere Democrats are in control, they totally ban them. Every Democrat controlled city, D.C., Baltimore, Maryland, Chicago, Illinois.
[12:32.280 --> 12:36.280]  Do I need to keep listing the names? Total gun bans for citizens.
[12:36.280 --> 12:40.280]  All over Europe, all over the world. Used to have guns, now no guns.
[12:40.280 --> 12:44.280]  England. Used to have guns, now no guns. Crime rates go up.
[12:44.280 --> 12:51.280]  And now they're just out in the open. All the Democrat candidates on the stage saying, we're going to confiscate all your guns, including Tulsi.
[12:51.280 --> 12:54.280]  There's good and a lot of stuff, but not on that.
[12:54.280 --> 12:58.280]  That's coming up. And then they announced on Friday, got almost no attention.
[12:58.280 --> 13:02.280]  Criminal investigations are now underway, which have already been underway.
[13:02.280 --> 13:06.280]  We told you of the Democrats and the attempted coup against Trump and the fake Russiagate.
[13:06.280 --> 13:10.280]  We had Roger Stone on Exclusive Worldwide Friday.
[13:10.280 --> 13:15.280]  That's coming out. We've got inside baseball for you. Huge, huge, huge.
[13:15.280 --> 13:18.280]  Remind me, crew, I just put it on the board so don't forget.
[13:18.280 --> 13:21.280]  So teleprompter, but there is a big TV, a black screen TV over here.
[13:21.280 --> 13:28.280]  We had a document cam that where they put reminders for me like, go to the calls or your guest is ready or don't forget this.
[13:28.280 --> 13:32.280]  I'm asking, put a note up there because I didn't forget that I need to give you the inside baseball on that.
[13:32.280 --> 13:35.280]  Last segment of the hour, I'll do that, please.
[13:35.280 --> 13:40.280]  Because there's no real producer here. I mean, I'm the guy that produces it. There's sub-producers.
[13:40.280 --> 13:47.280]  But I've got to remind them sometimes to remind me to cover things I say I am.
[13:47.280 --> 13:51.280]  So thank you guys. I need a producer actually that's in charge.
[13:51.280 --> 13:55.280]  We've got some great ones, but more and more, I just, my brain goes in some of the directions.
[13:55.280 --> 14:00.280]  I need somebody that I meet with. I say, this is my plan. Now make me follow it, but we'll see.
[14:00.280 --> 14:05.280]  We'll get into the latest on the attempts to take the president out, the ongoing coup.
[14:05.280 --> 14:08.280]  I mean, talk about sensational. We're living in amazing times right now.
[14:08.280 --> 14:12.280]  That's all coming up. Comey says he's not worried at all.
[14:12.280 --> 14:17.280]  I'm not worried about a single thing. Defiant Comey brushes off DOJ criminal investigation.
[14:17.280 --> 14:20.280]  We've got video of that. That's coming up.
[14:20.280 --> 14:25.280]  Impeachment panel threatens contempt of officials, defies subpoenas.
[14:25.280 --> 14:29.280]  I guess they've never heard of separation of powers. That's all coming up.
[14:29.280 --> 14:32.280]  And of course, first I'll play the clip of the compilation next segment.
[14:32.280 --> 14:40.280]  We do have it now where they promise to confiscate all your guns and also the other compilation
[14:40.280 --> 14:47.280]  where they are demonizing Trump for taking out the leader of ISIS at the Washington Post is now praising.
[14:47.280 --> 14:51.280]  It's all on info wars.com. It's all on news wars.com.
[14:51.280 --> 14:57.280]  Tomorrow's news today on this live global Sunday show that's not even supposed to exist.
[14:57.280 --> 15:01.280]  We're supposed to be off the air. We're supposed to be shut down, but thanks to you.
[15:01.280 --> 15:07.280]  We're on hundreds of radio stations and TV stations and reaching record size audiences at info wars.com
[15:07.280 --> 15:11.280]  and news wars.com on our own streams, our own video feeds, our own audio feeds.

[15:18.280 --> 15:21.280]  But crippled when it comes to Facebook or YouTube or Twitter.
[15:21.280 --> 15:28.280]  That's why we've got band.video, not a black mold URL yet where you can share the live feed of band.video
[15:28.280 --> 15:33.280]  and where you can share the archive of the full shows and the other great shows we host and produce
[15:33.280 --> 15:38.280]  and all other great reporters out in the field and Europe and the U.S. and all over the world.
[15:38.280 --> 15:46.280]  It's all at band.video, including the exclusive Rodgerstone Breaks the Silence Massive interview from Friday.
[15:46.280 --> 15:50.280]  Believe me, the system does not want you to see and the Google's trying to block.
[15:50.280 --> 15:58.280]  Okay, when we come back, we've got the compilation of the traitorous globalist media demonizing Trump for killing Al-Baghdadi.
[15:58.280 --> 16:06.280]  We'll be right back on the other side of the most banned demonized transmission in the world because we tell the truth.
[16:06.280 --> 16:11.280]  Please listen to this information because it can save your life and it can save the life of others.
[16:11.280 --> 16:15.280]  There couldn't be more critical information for your physical body.
[16:15.280 --> 16:19.280]  God's more important when it comes to your soul, but this is most important when it comes to your body.
[16:19.280 --> 16:26.280]  If people didn't know that you put motor oil in a car's oil container to lube the engine,
[16:26.280 --> 16:32.280]  they might be able to be conned and think you put salt water in it, but it would seize up the engine pretty much instantly.
[16:32.280 --> 16:37.280]  Well, if they put fluoride in the human body, it causes cancer, dumps us down, and destroys fertility.
[16:37.280 --> 16:45.280]  If you put the good halogen in the body, high-quality iodine, it's like putting good high-quality motor oil in the car that's supposed to run on it.
[16:45.280 --> 16:52.280]  It's that simple. Find out about the iodine conspiracy at infowarstore.com and find out what the globalists hope that you do not research this information.
[16:52.280 --> 16:58.280]  Ladies and gentlemen, whatever you do, research iodine deficiency. It's the key to everything.
[16:58.280 --> 17:06.280]  And then go and take advantage of the 60% off combo with our two different types of high-quality iodine and biotrystallinium at infowarstore.com today.
[17:06.280 --> 17:12.280]  Now, what I'm about to say is incredibly obvious, and I'm not talking down to any of the viewers or any of the listeners.
[17:12.280 --> 17:13.280]  I'm just stating the facts.
[17:13.280 --> 17:20.280]  I own a chainsaw. I've had it since I was in college, and it's a great, good old chainsaw, and I've used it probably 500 times.
[17:20.280 --> 17:27.280]  But a few times I've forgotten to oil it, and it seizes up really quick, and I feel like an idiot for not oiling it.
[17:27.280 --> 17:33.280]  Now imagine if somebody told me to put, let's say super glue in the oil container on it.
[17:33.280 --> 17:36.280]  It would seize up forever, but only an evil person would do that.
[17:36.280 --> 17:42.280]  Well, fluorides like putting super glue in a chainsaw is going to make it seize up, and that's why they put it in the water.
[17:42.280 --> 17:44.280]  And they admit they're doing it to hurt you and your family.
[17:44.280 --> 17:45.280]  Yes, they're really evil.
[17:45.280 --> 17:51.280]  Iodine is like putting oil in the chainsaw to help with the gasoline lubrication. It's that simple.
[17:51.280 --> 17:57.280]  I know you understand this, but let's warn other people before it's too late. It's part of the iodine conspiracy.
[17:57.280 --> 18:01.280]  Find out more at infowarstore.com and take action against the globalist.
[18:01.280 --> 18:06.280]  Carbon's everywhere on this planet. It's almost like we're carbon-based life forms.
[18:06.280 --> 18:09.280]  It is now an admitted fact.
[18:09.280 --> 18:16.280]  Fluoride out of the water has caused tens of millions of Americans to be brain damaged and to have infertility and low IQs.
[18:16.280 --> 18:21.280]  And it doesn't matter if the Journal of American Medical Association comes out and says it's terrible.
[18:21.280 --> 18:27.280]  Still, the city's put it in the water because the ruling globalists want you and your family poisoned and stupid.
[18:27.280 --> 18:36.280]  And they sure don't want you to know about the good allergen iodine that absolutely increases IQ and fertility and makes life so wonderful.
[18:36.280 --> 18:39.280]  It opens up your consciousness, your mind, everything.
[18:39.280 --> 18:42.280]  Thank God. Thank God. I discovered this eight years ago.
[18:42.280 --> 18:47.280]  Of course, the enemy knows all about it, and they hope you don't discover it. They hope you just roll over and die.

[19:03.280 --> 19:07.280]  Drink your fluoride and die! Give in to Satan! Give in!
[19:07.280 --> 19:11.280]  Infowars presents Alex Jones.
[19:11.280 --> 19:18.280]  In August of 2019, JAMA, or the Journal of the American Medical Association, the most prestigious came out and said,
[19:18.280 --> 19:26.280]  oh my gosh, just a little bit of fluoride in the water causes lowered IQs, massive infertility, and a lot of babies die in the womb, and it causes cancer.
[19:26.280 --> 19:29.280]  That was just one of thousands of studies admitting this.
[19:29.280 --> 19:36.280]  You know, it's illegal to have even one part per billion in the water in places like California unless it's part of adding fluoride.
[19:36.280 --> 19:45.280]  And then they have a waiver and can add thousands of deadly chemicals to your water because the liberals love you and they want to sexualize your children.
[19:45.280 --> 19:51.280]  So whatever you do, drink lots of fluoride and don't get the thing that counters in iodine at infowarstore.com.
[19:51.280 --> 19:57.280]  Drink fluoride and die! Drink fluoride, dirty Americans, and roll over.
[19:57.280 --> 20:03.280]  Do not visit infowarstore.com and get high-poly iodine to counter it. No, roll over and die, dirty Americans.
[20:03.280 --> 20:07.280]  infowarstore.com forward slash show.
[20:09.280 --> 20:12.280]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.

[20:24.280 --> 20:31.280]  crashing through the lies and disinformation it's Alex Jones coming to you live
[20:31.280 --> 20:38.280]  from the front lines of the info war
[20:38.280 --> 20:45.920]  It is Sunday, October 27th, 2019, and there's not supposed to be a people's media.
[20:45.920 --> 20:49.400]  There's not supposed to be a pro-America radio, TV network.
[20:49.400 --> 20:54.320]  There's not supposed to be people there to call out corporate mainstream media that's
[20:54.320 --> 21:00.080]  globalist and shy, common, telling us how much America sucks and telling us how bad
[21:00.080 --> 21:03.880]  we are and telling us the president didn't do a good job having the military take out
[21:03.880 --> 21:04.880]  the ISIS leader.
[21:04.880 --> 21:07.040]  No, he's a horrible person.
[21:07.040 --> 21:11.720]  He's supposed to stay in Syria where Obama and Hillary tried to take out the government
[21:11.720 --> 21:16.840]  and tried to turn it over to al-Qaeda, who set up an Islamic state.
[21:16.840 --> 21:22.720]  Well, one of bin Laden's former top guys is dead now.
[21:22.720 --> 21:28.240]  Washington Post changes al-Baghdadi obituary headline after calling ISIS leader, austere
[21:28.240 --> 21:33.320]  religious scholar, austere.
[21:33.320 --> 21:38.280]  And the Hill's reporting on that now, austere religious scholar.
[21:38.280 --> 21:43.840]  You know that under Obama and under Hillary and under Merkel, she's headed up the State
[21:43.840 --> 21:44.840]  Department.
[21:44.840 --> 21:45.840]  Hillary did.
[21:45.840 --> 21:49.320]  And under what's happening in the U.K., they would bring back former ISIS fighters and
[21:49.320 --> 21:55.760]  let them come back into the United States and Europe and England, the U.K.
[21:55.760 --> 21:58.000]  Obama funded the Arab Spring.
[21:58.000 --> 22:05.000]  Obama funded the attempted Islamic takeover through his cousin, Odinga, in Kenya.
[22:05.000 --> 22:08.120]  Unbelievable.
[22:08.120 --> 22:13.400]  Let's go ahead and go to this compilation that's posted on infowars.com and a very
[22:13.400 --> 22:15.760]  important article.
[22:15.760 --> 22:22.120]  Video compilation, corporate establishment media, Democrats bash Trump over killing
[22:22.120 --> 22:25.120]  of ISIS leader.
[22:25.120 --> 22:32.840]  This is Don Lemon, this is Chris Cuomo, this is Susan Rice, this is all of them up there
[22:32.840 --> 22:36.280]  bashing this, here it is.
[22:36.280 --> 22:41.080]  Not wanting to go through the main door because that was booby-trapped.
[22:41.080 --> 22:45.320]  And there was something, it was something really amazing to see.
[22:45.320 --> 22:53.400]  I got to watch it along with General Milley, Vice President Pence, others in the situation
[22:53.400 --> 22:58.400]  room, and we watched it so clearly.
[22:58.400 --> 23:04.880]  Well, I don't want to say how, but we had absolutely perfect as though you were watching
[23:04.880 --> 23:06.400]  a movie.
[23:06.400 --> 23:11.000]  It was, that in the technology there alone is really great.
[23:11.000 --> 23:17.200]  It bothered me a little bit, some of what the President did in providing detail about
[23:17.200 --> 23:22.120]  taking back to the United States pieces of Baghdadi's body.
[23:22.120 --> 23:28.480]  It bothered me a little bit hearing the President talk about some of that Syrian oil being ours.
[23:28.480 --> 23:33.320]  Because that's what inspires, that's what inspires some extremists.
[23:33.320 --> 23:44.920]  I wonder here if this type of killing only reinforces the ideology of Baghdadi's follow-up.
[23:44.920 --> 23:52.080]  My understanding interestingly enough is that that mission was accomplished with information
[23:52.080 --> 23:54.760]  supplied by the Kurds.
[23:54.760 --> 23:59.880]  And as we know, Trump has turned his back and betrayed the Kurds.
[23:59.880 --> 24:05.040]  Samantha, overnight this news of the raid, the President obviously speaking at great
[24:05.040 --> 24:09.440]  lengths sharing incredible detail about this mission in Syria.
[24:09.440 --> 24:10.920]  What strikes you, what stands out to you?
[24:10.920 --> 24:16.120]  Well, this is obviously a major accomplishment, but from a counterterrorism perspective, the
[24:16.120 --> 24:20.240]  President's engagement with the media on this, Brian, is pretty surprising to me.
[24:20.240 --> 24:22.240]  This is a high-risk period.
[24:22.240 --> 24:26.000]  Immediately after a special operation like this, there is increased risk of retaliatory
[24:26.000 --> 24:30.040]  attacks and risk to human sources on the ground in Syria, for example.
[24:30.040 --> 24:35.240]  The level of detail that President Trump went into in that press conference increases the
[24:35.240 --> 24:37.600]  risk to sources that may still be on the ground.
[24:37.600 --> 24:41.800]  It's really unprecedented when you think about how much detail he actually went into.
[24:41.800 --> 24:43.280]  Are you saying it's irresponsible?
[24:43.280 --> 24:44.680]  I think it is irresponsible.
[24:44.680 --> 24:46.760]  I think it puts sources at risk.
[24:46.760 --> 24:48.080]  And it's unnecessary at this point.
[24:48.080 --> 24:51.680]  He could have been much more succinct in what he said.
[24:51.680 --> 24:55.880]  Typically, you have all these talking points scrubbed by the intelligence community to
[24:55.880 --> 24:59.880]  make sure that they don't have the unintended impact of inspiring more attacks.
[24:59.880 --> 25:05.000]  He did try to preclude any image of Baghdadi as a martyr by describing him, I think as
[25:05.000 --> 25:07.840]  a whimpering dog and a coward and that sort of thing.
[25:07.840 --> 25:11.520]  But it's clear that while the intelligence community played a very big role in implementing
[25:11.520 --> 25:16.560]  this raid, it does not appear he's listening to them in terms of how to manage his aftermath.
[25:16.560 --> 25:18.520]  What is your reaction to the death of al-Baghdadi?
[25:18.520 --> 25:23.240]  Well, obviously, it's a major milestone, and it's one that we all should be welcoming
[25:23.240 --> 25:24.240]  quite plainly.
[25:24.240 --> 25:29.000]  But it doesn't mean that the fight against ISIS is over, and it doesn't mean that we
[25:29.000 --> 25:33.080]  can declare mission accomplished and just walk away.
[25:33.080 --> 25:37.160]  What we've seen time and time again in this part of the world is that when the pressure
[25:37.160 --> 25:43.240]  is relieved on terrorist organizations, whether Al-Qaeda or ISIS, they are able to reconstitute.
[25:43.240 --> 25:44.760]  So we need to be vigilant.
[25:44.760 --> 25:50.680]  We need to maintain a minimal presence in order to ensure that the pressure stays on ISIS
[25:50.680 --> 25:53.680]  and they don't come back roaring.
[25:53.680 --> 25:58.720]  The President also said in his remarks that he planned or wanted to release some video
[25:58.720 --> 26:05.560]  of those last few moments of Baghdadi's life that he repeatedly characterized, called him
[26:05.560 --> 26:08.320]  a dog, whimpering, crying.
[26:08.320 --> 26:12.680]  He wanted ISIS's followers to see him like that.
[26:12.680 --> 26:14.160]  Margaret, this is piling on.
[26:14.160 --> 26:15.160]  Would you advise this?
[26:15.160 --> 26:16.160]  This is piling on.
[26:16.160 --> 26:20.160]  The one part of the President's remarks that did bother me was this continual piling on
[26:20.160 --> 26:21.160]  of humiliation.
[26:21.160 --> 26:26.320]  A little bit of that is appropriate, but you're sending a signal to some of his followers around
[26:26.320 --> 26:27.320]  the world that could cause him to...
[26:27.320 --> 26:29.120]  Let me pause for a minute.
[26:29.120 --> 26:33.720]  We're going to play a clip when we come back of, or maybe even now, of Obama when they
[26:33.720 --> 26:36.560]  said they killed bin Laden, which was a fake raid.
[26:36.560 --> 26:37.560]  It's come out.
[26:37.560 --> 26:42.360]  I had former counterterrorism expert, one of the founders of Delta Force, Dr. C. Pachinicon,
[26:42.360 --> 26:45.960]  who said before bin Laden had already died of kidney failure that they had his body on
[26:45.960 --> 26:46.960]  ice.
[26:46.960 --> 26:48.600]  They would later roll this out.
[26:48.600 --> 26:54.000]  The SEALs reportedly killed a body double that lived there by the military base in Pakistan.
[26:54.000 --> 26:56.560]  That's why Trump's going to release video, because this is real.
[26:56.560 --> 26:58.520]  Trump's really getting us out of these wars.
[26:58.520 --> 27:00.480]  Trump's really trying to bring the economy back.
[27:00.480 --> 27:04.320]  Trump's really beating China in a trade war.
[27:04.320 --> 27:06.000]  So that's why they're so scared.
[27:06.000 --> 27:11.120]  And then for the very Democrats and deep staters and globalists that overthrew Qaddafi, put
[27:11.120 --> 27:16.800]  al-Qaeda in charge there, took the weapons, invaded Syria, bragged about it, destabilized
[27:16.800 --> 27:20.560]  the whole Middle East and North Africa to turn around and say that Trump's going to
[27:20.560 --> 27:26.560]  cause terror when the so-called terrorists say they're attacking us, and really a lot
[27:26.560 --> 27:30.560]  of them are globalists handled, there's a bunch of cowards, because we're in the Middle
[27:30.560 --> 27:31.560]  East.
[27:31.560 --> 27:35.840]  But the truth is, the globalists have been working with Saudi Arabia to turn the world
[27:35.840 --> 27:39.120]  over to radical Islam, and Trump is actually fighting it.
[27:39.120 --> 27:43.480]  He's not playing games, and getting our military out of the Middle East is exactly what we
[27:43.480 --> 27:44.480]  need to do.
[27:44.480 --> 27:48.800]  Then if they attack us, we blow the living hell out of them, ladies and gentlemen, but
[27:48.800 --> 27:52.400]  we have to pivot to communist China, that is the main area.
[27:52.400 --> 27:56.680]  That full compilation, there's even more of it, is on infowars.com, there were a bunch
[27:56.680 --> 27:57.680]  of separate videos.
[27:57.680 --> 28:02.360]  I've had our guys add them all together into one seven-minute video, you saw about five
[28:02.360 --> 28:07.680]  minutes of it, it's being posted right down to the article on infowars.com, compilation
[28:07.680 --> 28:13.080]  media Democrats bash Trump over killing a ISIS leader, you've got to share the article,
[28:13.080 --> 28:15.000]  and you've got to share the video.
[28:15.000 --> 28:22.120]  And again, we have to watch some post praising him as an austere scholar, just this wonderful
[28:22.120 --> 28:23.620]  religious leader.
[28:23.620 --> 28:27.120]  These people are sick, you heard them talking about how mean it is, talking about killing
[28:27.120 --> 28:31.400]  him, how it's going to get us attacked, these are the people that have been working with
[28:31.400 --> 28:32.400]  Islamic State.
[28:32.400 --> 28:36.200]  These are the people that have been opening the borders of Europe and the United States,
[28:36.200 --> 28:39.400]  everywhere else, to the jihadis, most of military-age men.
[28:39.400 --> 28:44.880]  It's sick, it's been the patriots, and America, and Trump, and our military, under real leadership,
[28:44.880 --> 28:46.320]  it's been stopping.
[28:46.320 --> 28:51.080]  And Russia has been heavily involved, wiping out radical Islamists that are attacking Europe
[28:51.080 --> 28:52.080]  and Russia as well.
[28:52.080 --> 28:56.320]  Let's give credit where credit is due, and that's pissing the deep state off, and you
[28:56.320 --> 29:00.760]  know McCain's rolling in his dirty grave, he was instrumental in helping ISIS and al-Qaeda
[29:00.760 --> 29:03.120]  overthrow Syria, but he failed.
[29:03.120 --> 29:06.440]  We'll be back with even bigger breaking news, stay with us.
[29:06.440 --> 29:11.880]  Hello here, my name is Berthelman.
[29:11.880 --> 29:18.520]  I work for my father, Lucifer, and he doesn't like the fact that God gave you all families
[29:18.520 --> 29:24.520]  and children, and so we want to tell you something right now, Christian countries.
[29:24.520 --> 29:29.080]  We took control of you over a hundred years ago, we've been spiking your water with fluoride,
[29:29.080 --> 29:34.880]  to lower your fertility, and to hurt you, and it's worked so well, but now, because
[29:34.880 --> 29:39.760]  of liability, and because of people warning inside the government what's happening, the
[29:39.760 --> 29:44.320]  Journal of American Medical Association and others are admitting what we've done, and
[29:44.320 --> 29:48.960]  it makes me so angry, so whatever you do, just stay in that haze, and drink fluoride
[29:48.960 --> 29:55.680]  and give it to your children, and don't visit infowarstore.com, and learn about the
[29:55.680 --> 30:00.960]  island conspiracy, and get 60% off on X2 and X3 together with bio-trusilidium from the
[30:00.960 --> 30:05.040]  mustard seed, submit to us.
[30:05.040 --> 30:13.280]  Again, I'm not talking down to the infowar's audience, but I've been banging my head against
[30:13.280 --> 30:17.760]  a wall for a long time on this, and I'm talking about fluoride, and I'm talking about
[30:17.760 --> 30:18.760]  iodine.
[30:18.760 --> 30:24.200]  Now, if you have a boat, a motor boat, let's say an old glass-tron boat, and you want to
[30:24.200 --> 30:28.160]  take it on the lake, you've got to have a lake to put it in.
[30:28.160 --> 30:33.440]  If you're a human being, you've got to have oxygen to live, okay, it's the same thing.
[30:33.440 --> 30:36.880]  Well, ladies and gentlemen, the bad halogen is fluoride.
[30:36.880 --> 30:39.400]  That's why, in every western nation, they put it in the water.
[30:39.400 --> 30:41.760]  They're going to teach us Christians lay down and die.
[30:41.760 --> 30:45.120]  The chai-coms don't put it in the water, they'd execute you if you did that.
[30:45.120 --> 30:50.040]  They put iodine in the water, because it's the good halogen, and increases fertility,
[30:50.040 --> 30:53.080]  and lifespan, and intelligence, and everything else.
[30:53.080 --> 30:57.800]  So again, learn about the iodine conspiracy at infowarstore.com, we have all the documents
[30:57.800 --> 31:01.960]  and articles linked, and then get good iodine for yourself, because the globalists are fighting
[31:01.960 --> 31:02.960]  to make sure you don't.
[31:02.960 --> 31:09.160]  Again, get iodine at infowarstore.com.
[31:09.160 --> 31:12.440]  Here are the facts.
[31:12.440 --> 31:18.520]  Iodine raises IQ, and across the board makes you more healthy in thousands of top studies,
[31:18.520 --> 31:21.160]  including the American Medical Journal.
[31:21.160 --> 31:27.720]  Every type of fluoride lowers IQ, massively increases cancer, and destroys fertility.
[31:27.720 --> 31:29.040]  That's the facts.
[31:29.040 --> 31:33.920]  Learn about the iodine conspiracy, and then, once you've learned about it, protect yourself
[31:33.920 --> 31:34.920]  and your family.
[31:34.920 --> 31:39.680]  The reason I'm so hot on this is the globalists put the fluoride in the water, while making
[31:39.680 --> 31:40.920]  sure we don't get the iodine.
[31:40.920 --> 31:45.200]  In China, they put the iodine in the water, and ban the fluoride, because they've already
[31:45.200 --> 31:46.960]  got their people under their control.
[31:46.960 --> 31:49.480]  The globalists are targeting us here.
[31:49.480 --> 31:54.040]  Please go to infowarstore.com, experience iodine and bio-pucillinium that goes with
[31:54.040 --> 31:57.720]  it together, and then once you see the great results, warn others.
[31:57.720 --> 31:59.720]  This is the Achilles' Hill of the Globalist.
[31:59.720 --> 32:00.720]  It's a win-win situation.
[32:00.720 --> 32:02.720]  The only way you lose is not taking action.
[32:02.720 --> 32:07.880]  Take action now.
[32:07.880 --> 32:10.500]  It is now an admitted fact.
[32:10.500 --> 32:14.800]  Fluoride out of the water has caused tens of millions of Americans to be brain-damaged
[32:14.800 --> 32:19.520]  and to have infertility and low IQs, and it doesn't matter if the Journal of American
[32:19.520 --> 32:24.000]  Medical Association comes out and says it's terrible, still the city's put it in the water,
[32:24.000 --> 32:28.320]  it's the ruling globalists want you and your family poisoned and stupid, and they sure
[32:28.320 --> 32:35.640]  don't want you to know about the good allergen, iodine, that absolutely increases IQ and fertility
[32:35.640 --> 32:40.320]  and makes life so wonderful and opens up your consciousness, your mind, everything.
[32:40.320 --> 32:41.320]  Thank God.
[32:41.320 --> 32:42.320]  Thank God.
[32:42.320 --> 32:43.320]  I discovered this eight years ago.
[32:43.320 --> 32:46.480]  Of course, the enemy knows all about it, and they hope you don't discover it.
[32:46.480 --> 32:48.080]  They hope you just roll over and die.
[32:48.080 --> 32:53.240]  So whatever you do, don't visit infowarstore.com and get 60% off right now on the Wake Up the
[32:53.240 --> 32:58.520]  World to the iodine conspiracy combo, 60% off with X2 and X3 together with your bottle
[32:58.520 --> 33:03.240]  of Biotruce Selenium, whatever you do, don't go to infowarstore.com, just give up America,
[33:03.240 --> 33:10.880]  give up Christians, drink your fluoride and die, give in to Satan, give him up.
[33:10.880 --> 33:34.880]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[33:34.880 --> 33:42.880]  Good evening.
[33:42.880 --> 33:52.400]  Tonight, I can report to the American people and to the world that the United States has
[33:52.400 --> 33:58.800]  conducted an operation that killed Osama bin Laden, the leader of al Qaeda, and a terrorist
[33:58.800 --> 34:05.280]  who's responsible for the murder of thousands of innocent men, women, and children.
[34:05.280 --> 34:10.600]  Last August, after years of painstaking work by ourselves this year, when Obama made those
[34:10.600 --> 34:17.720]  claims many years ago, as far from certain, the corporate controlled media was in ecstasy.
[34:17.720 --> 34:23.160]  They were stuck on orgasm for about a month.
[34:23.160 --> 34:30.120]  It was as if Obama was the second coming of Christ, a magical leprechaun showering us
[34:30.120 --> 34:34.880]  all with diamonds and rubies and gold.
[34:34.880 --> 34:42.800]  But Trump comes out and has proof, that's why they're going to release the video of
[34:42.800 --> 34:50.200]  him hiding like a weasel down in a hole, taking his children with him and blowing them up.
[34:50.200 --> 34:55.400]  This video of all this, and the media is attacking Trump for saying he died like a cowardly
[34:55.400 --> 34:56.400]  dog.
[34:56.400 --> 35:00.800]  I don't know why people always say like a dog, it's an old fashioned saying, I guess
[35:00.800 --> 35:04.360]  without respect or something, dogs have a lot of courage, usually, with a dog going
[35:04.360 --> 35:05.360]  into getting.
[35:05.360 --> 35:10.120]  I don't think I really agree with, maybe he died like a cowardly demonic spider, taking
[35:10.120 --> 35:11.120]  three children with him.
[35:11.120 --> 35:13.160]  I mean, I'm not going to just sit here and agree with Trump.
[35:13.160 --> 35:16.440]  I think that's an honor to call the guy a dog.
[35:16.440 --> 35:27.960]  I want to be thought of as dog-like, loyal, strong, attentive, focused, ready to fight.
[35:27.960 --> 35:30.080]  When you think of courage, you think of a dog.
[35:30.080 --> 35:34.360]  I mean, this daughter has a poster my mom gave her on her first birthday hanging on
[35:34.360 --> 35:38.760]  the wall from like the 1920s, it's an image of, it says courage, and it's a cartoon of
[35:38.760 --> 35:43.200]  a dog jumping in a lake to save a little girl, but I'm not trying to quibble here.
[35:43.200 --> 35:48.800]  The point is, how dare Trump criticize this guy, it'll make him attack us more.
[35:48.800 --> 35:57.320]  What a sick joke, ladies and gentlemen, when it's the left worldwide from Merkel to Obama
[35:57.320 --> 36:04.280]  bringing these people in to our countries, he reached the end of the tunnel as our dogs
[36:04.280 --> 36:11.720]  chased them down and then detonated the suicide vest killing himself and three of his children.
[36:11.720 --> 36:15.280]  In fact, let's find that clip, I'm going to play that, maybe we should play Trump's whole
[36:15.280 --> 36:18.280]  speech on this.
[36:18.280 --> 36:24.600]  He was a sick and depraved man, the president added, and now he's gone.
[36:24.600 --> 36:32.280]  So, I guess he died just like Joseph Goebbels with his children, Joseph Goebbels poisoned
[36:32.280 --> 36:36.920]  his children with cyanide, I guess this guy blew his children up.
[36:36.920 --> 36:45.040]  But the big news is, they're attacking Trump for this and saying he politicized it.
[36:45.040 --> 36:52.400]  When Obama specifically green-lighted the Navy to have all these movies made, to have
[36:52.400 --> 36:59.280]  all this propaganda put out, and of course, the Navy Seals said, man, it looks like that
[36:59.280 --> 37:03.440]  guy we killed didn't look like bin Laden, he looked a lot like him, and as they began
[37:03.440 --> 37:09.680]  to learn that they hadn't killed him, biggest loss of Navy Seals in Navy history, they put
[37:09.680 --> 37:14.040]  them on helicopters soon thereafter and fly them out, and then the helicopter blows up
[37:14.040 --> 37:16.440]  with a bomb on board, remember all that?
[37:16.440 --> 37:21.600]  And I was told that by Navy Seals back at the time, another reason I absolutely hate
[37:21.600 --> 37:26.920]  my guts inside the whole globalist confab, so they went out there to a real raid right
[37:26.920 --> 37:34.160]  next to the National Military Academy in Pakistan where the bin Laden body double lived, and
[37:34.160 --> 37:40.600]  they did indeed kill him, but it wasn't a summer bin Laden, it was one bin Laden that
[37:40.600 --> 37:47.160]  died many years earlier from Marfan's syndrome, and we, of course, broke that many, many years
[37:47.160 --> 37:49.040]  before, totally fake.
[37:49.040 --> 37:57.360]  Remember, this is Obama caught staging all these other fake events, time and time and
[37:57.360 --> 38:04.880]  time again, and lying about what really happened at Benghazi, and that criminal stand down
[38:04.880 --> 38:06.920]  as well.
[38:06.920 --> 38:13.720]  So I want to open the phones up in the second hour specifically on the Sunday edition for
[38:13.720 --> 38:19.360]  first-time callers, when we have first-time callers a chance today, especially military
[38:19.360 --> 38:24.200]  or others that want to comment on what just happened and what you think of MSM, enemy
[38:24.200 --> 38:29.640]  of the people, demonizing and coming out after the president across the board.
[38:29.640 --> 38:36.960]  If you just joined us, I played part of a long compilation of all the usual suspects
[38:36.960 --> 38:45.080]  saying that Trump politicized this, that Trump's bad, that Trump's terrible, I want
[38:45.080 --> 38:54.760]  to give you a chance to respond to that and give us your take on it, 877-789-2539, 877-789-2539.
[38:54.760 --> 38:58.120]  And then after you give me your take on that, because I'm really interested to hear what
[38:58.120 --> 39:03.800]  you think is coming next, we told you that about a month and a half ago, the Justice
[39:03.800 --> 39:11.960]  Department and Deputy AG said, we are not going to overturn a judgment by a U.S. attorney
[39:11.960 --> 39:26.360]  for an indictment against former FBI Director McCabe, that'd be the first time he's sitting
[39:26.360 --> 39:30.440]  FBI Director, someone that did sit as FBI Director, knows Deputy, what that would happen.
[39:30.440 --> 39:34.760]  And the fact that they said no to overturning that means he's been indicted, and it means
[39:34.760 --> 39:36.880]  this has been a criminal investigation for a long time.
[39:36.880 --> 39:40.520]  Well, that was all confirmed Friday, that it's a criminal investigation going on for
[39:40.520 --> 39:44.520]  really a year, Durham's whole investigation, there's several others.
[39:44.520 --> 39:55.440]  I told you over a year ago, it's New York, it's Maryland, it's D.C., it's Virginia,
[39:55.440 --> 40:00.520]  it's Connecticut, and several other states have criminal investigations.
[40:00.520 --> 40:04.760]  And that's been in the news that there are grand juries of both types, both informational
[40:04.760 --> 40:08.560]  and indictment grand juries, open, that's been in the Associated Press.
[40:08.560 --> 40:13.960]  I've read it where it's confirmed, I've talked to lawyers involved, and people still can't
[40:13.960 --> 40:15.080]  believe it's really going on.
[40:15.080 --> 40:23.040]  But two weeks ago, Giuliani was on Fox News, and he said, no, within two weeks, you will
[40:23.040 --> 40:24.040]  see action.
[40:24.040 --> 40:25.040]  And it happened.
[40:25.040 --> 40:26.040]  It was a Thursday.
[40:26.040 --> 40:31.760]  He said within two weeks, and that Thursday night's when that broke in the Wall Street
[40:31.760 --> 40:32.760]  Journal.
[40:32.760 --> 40:35.880]  That was last Thursday night, we covered it Friday here on the Friday weekday show.
[40:35.880 --> 40:41.220]  So I want to get your take on that, breaking bar, Durham investigation is now officially
[40:41.220 --> 40:46.120]  a criminal investigation, and that's why the deep state is freaking out.
[40:46.120 --> 40:48.760]  What do you think they're going to do to counter this?
[40:48.760 --> 40:52.280]  You know, Comey, we'll play that video when we come back as well, he's running around
[40:52.280 --> 40:57.520]  acting like he's super, super confident.
[40:57.520 --> 41:00.760]  And that everything's fine, everything's good.
[41:00.760 --> 41:08.840]  I'm not worried about a single thing and defiant Comey brushes off DOJ criminal investigation.
[41:08.840 --> 41:11.000]  And then we're also going to get to Beto or Rourke.
[41:11.000 --> 41:16.960]  Let's just play that clip now saying yes, we will come to your house, we will take your
[41:16.960 --> 41:21.720]  guns because all the Democratic candidates agree with this.
[41:21.720 --> 41:23.560]  This is who they are, it's what they've always been.
[41:23.560 --> 41:24.560]  Now they're just being honest.
[41:24.560 --> 41:28.400]  So another thing we've been totally vindicated on here it is.
[41:28.400 --> 41:34.320]  For anyone who does not and is caught in possession or seen in possession of one of these weapons
[41:34.320 --> 41:39.600]  of war, one of these instruments of terror, that weapon will be taken from them and they
[41:39.600 --> 41:41.680]  will be fined.
[41:41.680 --> 41:47.160]  And if they should persist in continuing to use and to buy these weapons and there will
[41:47.160 --> 41:51.040]  be other consequences in the criminal code.
[41:51.040 --> 41:55.640]  So we've got about 200 million gun owners roughly in the country, most of them on about
[41:55.640 --> 41:56.800]  five guns.
[41:56.800 --> 41:58.840]  So good luck with that.
[41:58.840 --> 42:02.520]  All that would do is cause a civil war, which is what they're looking for and it's what
[42:02.520 --> 42:03.520]  they want.
[42:03.520 --> 42:08.000]  Now I said coming back to the next segment, I'm going to get into the ongoing coup and
[42:08.000 --> 42:09.680]  the criminal investigation into it.
[42:09.680 --> 42:13.480]  It's not just into Russiagate, that was the criminal coup.
[42:13.480 --> 42:16.680]  And they've got a new criminal coup going with the whole Ukraine situation, but the
[42:16.680 --> 42:19.680]  wheels have come off on that spectacularly.
[42:19.680 --> 42:21.200]  But you're not going to see that in the mainstream media.
[42:21.200 --> 42:25.320]  I'm going to cover that and the whole star chamber of events that are going on.
[42:25.320 --> 42:29.680]  And then next hour, your calls at 877-789-Alex, 877-789-2539.
[42:29.680 --> 42:35.160]  And by the way, if you disagree with me, you're welcome to call in.
[42:35.160 --> 42:39.280]  If you think it's terrible, but what Trump did and the military did killing the leader
[42:39.280 --> 42:43.200]  of ISIS, no little leftists are really upset about this.
[42:43.200 --> 42:44.200]  You're welcome to call in.
[42:44.200 --> 42:47.840]  And if you think that it's good, they're trying to crash the economy to punish Trump supporters,
[42:47.840 --> 42:49.840]  and please call us.
[42:49.840 --> 42:51.440]  If you think it's good to impeach Trump, please call us too.
[42:51.440 --> 43:00.640]  Go to the head of the line, 877-789-Alex, 877-789-2539, infowars.com, newswars.com, Tamara's News
[43:00.640 --> 43:04.560]  Today, first-time callers tonight on the Sunday Transmission.
[43:04.560 --> 43:05.560]  Stay with us.
[43:05.560 --> 43:12.520]  Hello, today on All Things Considered, I'm Wilbur Snakily to tell you all that there's
[43:12.520 --> 43:17.800]  been a lot of conspiracy theories out there that fluoride in your water is hurting you.
[43:17.800 --> 43:23.400]  Now, sure, the Journal of American Medical Association admits that it's causing some
[43:23.400 --> 43:28.680]  cancer and massive brain damage and infertility, but after all, isn't there too many people?
[43:28.680 --> 43:31.560]  That's right, drink the fluoride.
[43:31.560 --> 43:38.000]  Don't visit infowarsstore.com and get the good halogen, I mean the bad halogen, iodine.
[43:38.000 --> 43:43.240]  Don't give it to yourself, your husband, your wife, your children, just drink the fluoride
[43:43.240 --> 43:47.840]  and plunge into subservience to us.
[43:47.840 --> 43:52.360]  We don't want to compete with you, just drink the fluoride.
[43:52.360 --> 43:57.800]  Don't learn about how deadly it is and whatever you do, don't support Alex Jones.
[43:57.800 --> 44:03.440]  Remember, I'm speaking with a soft voice, so I'm a liberal, oh, and let Namble have
[44:03.440 --> 44:06.960]  access to your children.
[44:06.960 --> 44:11.040]  Please listen to this information because it can save your life and it can save the life
[44:11.040 --> 44:12.040]  of others.
[44:12.040 --> 44:15.600]  There couldn't be more critical information for your physical body.
[44:15.600 --> 44:18.640]  God's more important when it comes to your soul, but this is most important when it comes
[44:18.640 --> 44:19.800]  to your body.
[44:19.800 --> 44:26.880]  If people didn't know that you put motor oil in a car's oil container to lube the engine,
[44:26.880 --> 44:30.480]  they might be able to be conned and think you put salt water in it, but it would seize
[44:30.480 --> 44:32.440]  up the engine pretty much instantly.
[44:32.440 --> 44:37.480]  Well, if they put fluoride in the human body, it causes cancer, dumbs us down, and destroys
[44:37.480 --> 44:38.480]  fertility.
[44:38.480 --> 44:42.840]  But with the good halogen in the body, high-quality iodine, it's like putting good high-quality
[44:42.840 --> 44:46.040]  motor oil in the car that's supposed to run on it.
[44:46.040 --> 44:47.040]  It's that simple.
[44:47.040 --> 44:51.440]  Find out about the iodine conspiracy at InfoWareStore.com and find out what the globalists hope that
[44:51.440 --> 44:53.080]  you do not research this information.
[44:53.080 --> 44:56.920]  Ladies and gentlemen, whatever you do, research iodine deficiency.
[44:56.920 --> 44:58.880]  It's the key to everything.
[44:58.880 --> 45:03.360]  And then go and take advantage of the 60% off combo with our two different types of high-quality
[45:03.360 --> 45:07.680]  iodine and biotrystallinium at InfoWareStore.com today.
[45:07.680 --> 45:10.320]  It is now an admitted fact.
[45:10.320 --> 45:14.640]  Fluoride out of the water has caused tens of millions of Americans to be brain damaged
[45:14.640 --> 45:17.600]  and to have infertility and low IQs.
[45:17.600 --> 45:20.880]  And it doesn't matter if the Journal of American Medical Association comes out and says it's
[45:20.880 --> 45:25.920]  terrible, still the city's put it in the water because the ruling globalists want you and
[45:25.920 --> 45:27.760]  your family poisoned and stupid.
[45:27.760 --> 45:33.920]  And they sure don't want you to know about the good halogen iodine that absolutely increases
[45:33.920 --> 45:39.560]  IQ and fertility and makes life so wonderful and opens up your consciousness, your mind,
[45:39.560 --> 45:40.560]  everything.
[45:40.560 --> 45:41.560]  Thank God.
[45:41.560 --> 45:42.560]  Thank God.
[45:42.560 --> 45:43.560]  I discovered this eight years ago.
[45:43.560 --> 45:46.320]  Of course, the enemy knows all about it and they hope you don't discover it.
[45:46.320 --> 45:48.040]  They hope you just roll over and die.
[45:48.040 --> 45:53.080]  So whatever you do, don't visit InfoWareStore.com and get 60% off right now on the Wake Up the
[45:53.080 --> 45:58.380]  World to the Iodine Conspiracy Combo, 60% off with X2 and X3 together with your bottle
[45:58.380 --> 45:59.880]  of biotrystallinium.
[45:59.880 --> 46:01.920]  Whatever you do, don't go to InfoWareStore.com.
[46:01.920 --> 46:03.080]  Just give up America.
[46:03.080 --> 46:04.080]  Give up Christians.
[46:04.080 --> 46:05.080]  Break your floor right and die.
[46:05.080 --> 46:06.080]  Give indecision.
[46:06.080 --> 46:07.080]  Give evil.
[46:07.080 --> 46:12.760]  Now, what I'm about to say is incredibly obvious and I'm not talking down to any of the viewers
[46:12.760 --> 46:13.760]  or any of the listeners.
[46:13.760 --> 46:14.760]  I'm just stating the facts.
[46:14.760 --> 46:15.760]  I own a chainsaw.
[46:15.760 --> 46:20.200]  I've had it since I was in college and it's a great, good old chainsaw and I've used
[46:20.200 --> 46:25.840]  it probably 500 times, but a few times I've forgotten to oil it and it seizes up really
[46:25.840 --> 46:28.920]  quick and I feel like an idiot for not oiling it.
[46:28.920 --> 46:34.920]  Now imagine if somebody told me to put, let's say super glue in the oil container on it.
[46:34.920 --> 46:38.320]  It would seize up forever, but only an evil person would do that.
[46:38.320 --> 46:42.160]  Well, fluorides like putting super glue in a chainsaw, it's going to make it seize up
[46:42.160 --> 46:45.400]  and that's why they put it in the water and they admit they're doing it to hurt you and
[46:45.400 --> 46:46.400]  your family.
[46:46.400 --> 46:47.900]  Yes, they're really evil.
[46:47.900 --> 46:52.440]  Iodine is like putting oil in the chainsaw to help with the gasoline lubrication.
[46:52.440 --> 46:53.440]  It's that simple.
[46:53.440 --> 46:56.960]  I know you understand this, but let's warn other people before it's too late.
[46:56.960 --> 46:58.840]  It's part of the Iodine Conspiracy.
[46:58.840 --> 47:03.280]  Find out more at m4store.com and take action against the globalist.
[47:03.280 --> 47:04.880]  Carbon's everywhere on this planet.
[47:04.880 --> 47:10.320]  It's almost like we're carbon-based life forms.
[47:10.320 --> 47:22.840]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[47:22.840 --> 47:27.840]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic.
[47:27.840 --> 47:40.960]  So here he is, the former disgraced FBI director who said before Congress he never leaked anybody
[47:40.960 --> 47:45.120]  and then it turned out he was the master leaker of disinformation.
[47:45.120 --> 47:49.600]  Here's the guy that oversaw the criminal investigation of the president that was illegal because
[47:49.600 --> 47:52.840]  it wasn't done properly that he lied to the president and Congress about.
[47:52.840 --> 48:00.880]  Here he is in a giant confidence act on national television saying everything's fine is from
[48:00.880 --> 48:01.880]  zero hedge.com.
[48:01.880 --> 48:02.880]  Here it is.
[48:02.880 --> 48:05.960]  The important way he can do that is give us transparency.
[48:05.960 --> 48:12.040]  I'm not worried about a single thing in connection with any of the matters under investigation.
[48:12.040 --> 48:16.080]  Gather the facts, write a report and share it with the American people.
[48:16.080 --> 48:20.600]  Please do that because all this stuff in the media with the attorney general saying stuff
[48:20.600 --> 48:26.840]  doesn't jive is an attack on the integrity of the institution which he is supposed to
[48:26.840 --> 48:27.840]  be leading.
[48:27.840 --> 48:32.520]  The way to protect that is show the folks the facts, lay it out.
[48:32.520 --> 48:38.920]  Don't drip it out, don't leak it out, give it out and I'm confident that when the American
[48:38.920 --> 48:43.600]  people see the picture of why we did what we did their confidence in the institution will
[48:43.600 --> 48:52.560]  be maintained, restored and protected.
[48:52.560 --> 48:59.160]  Now on Saturday Robert Barnes and I filed a special report that's at man.video that
[48:59.160 --> 49:03.960]  we're not going to play all of it here today but it's extremely powerful.
[49:03.960 --> 49:08.840]  The headline on it is rats leave the sinking ship.
[49:08.840 --> 49:16.520]  Deep staters turn against Hillary and Obama and in it we show you the articles and the
[49:16.520 --> 49:25.360]  reports where there's not just criminal investigations but the DOJ into Comey and McCabe and Mueller
[49:25.360 --> 49:33.080]  and Strach and Page and or and all the rest of the angry Democrats.
[49:33.080 --> 49:40.560]  You now have the FBI's chief counsel the head lawyer of the FBI James Baker confirmed
[49:40.560 --> 49:46.760]  it's in the DC news he's confirmed it a cooperating witness with all of this so that's why the
[49:46.760 --> 49:52.520]  headline at band.video is rats leave the sinking ship.
[49:52.520 --> 49:56.480]  In fact there's a headline on m4s.com today that has a live feed of the show I'm going
[49:56.480 --> 50:02.960]  to have our writer that's out there Jamie White add to that live feed article.
[50:02.960 --> 50:07.320]  The special report that Barnes filed when I say I filed it too I was up here working
[50:07.320 --> 50:11.120]  with them on it with some of the research very important very detailed 30 minute report
[50:11.120 --> 50:14.400]  you need to see it you share it.
[50:14.400 --> 50:20.600]  We've got a headline on m4s all hell is breaking lists well let's add that video rats leave
[50:20.600 --> 50:25.120]  the sinking ship to that so listeners that didn't see it can see it and then share it
[50:25.120 --> 50:29.640]  because it lays all of it out and I'm getting to some of it obviously right now but it's
[50:29.640 --> 50:36.760]  at band.video and the headline is rats leave the sinking ship we can just go to band.video
[50:36.760 --> 50:40.960]  click it we can show TV viewers right there yeah it's right there on the side carousel
[50:40.960 --> 50:46.120]  exactly just dead ahead right there just go this is fun I'm enjoying this just just open
[50:46.120 --> 50:50.920]  up right there you see Roger Stone exclusive emergency measures around right in the middle
[50:50.920 --> 50:59.560]  and then right beside it you see Robert Barnes signal studio that is the video right there
[50:59.560 --> 51:08.400]  rats leave the sinking ship I don't know why band.video on a TV screen pulls up wider
[51:08.400 --> 51:13.520]  format than it should be that's a bug we're working on but let's try to minimize that
[51:13.520 --> 51:18.600]  for everybody on there if we can just minimize that for everybody I'll show it on my phone
[51:18.600 --> 51:28.640]  there it is okay rats leave sinking ship deep staters flip against Obama and Hillary
[51:28.640 --> 51:37.560]  so that's the big enchilada report that you want to share and look it's only got 92,931
[51:37.560 --> 51:43.600]  views yeah that's great for band.video but if that was on YouTube before they banned
[51:43.600 --> 51:46.560]  everything we talk about everything we do you'd have 10 million views right now and that's
[51:46.560 --> 51:58.760]  why they don't want us there so again ladies and gentlemen on this live Sunday show it
[51:58.760 --> 52:04.800]  is absolutely critical that you realize that this is not a spectator sport they admit they're
[52:04.800 --> 52:09.920]  coming for your guns they admit they're coming for your children they admit they're coming
[52:09.920 --> 52:16.680]  for everything to dominate and control the nation globalism is a bunch of private corporations
[52:16.680 --> 52:24.840]  above the law tax exempt offshore that believe they can capture and take control of nation
[52:24.840 --> 52:30.240]  states and use our openness as a tool against us but if we simply become aware of what they're
[52:30.240 --> 52:37.480]  doing and say no to it and get involved and get informed it's game over now let's let's
[52:37.480 --> 52:49.200]  pull back for a moment and let's talk about this because it's so over the top key we're
[52:49.200 --> 52:56.480]  told five weeks ago that there's a Ukraine whistleblower it's like the dossiers this
[52:56.480 --> 53:00.760]  cool name this cool word the dossier itself was fake written up by Democrats they paid
[53:00.760 --> 53:05.040]  themselves tens of millions of dollars to cook up the fraudulent piece of garbage and
[53:05.040 --> 53:08.760]  then we hear oh there's another person that backs up the whistleblower that person says
[53:08.760 --> 53:12.160]  oh it was a third party too and now we're not going to hear from the whistleblower in
[53:12.160 --> 53:17.280]  Congress as I predicted five weeks ago or weeks ago because none of it's real none
[53:17.280 --> 53:23.160]  of it's true it's all just innuendo and then they have hearings and shift the head of the
[53:23.160 --> 53:27.520]  intelligence committee in the house reads a fake transcript of the president and doesn't
[53:27.520 --> 53:35.640]  tell people for 30 minutes it's fake till later and other fake transcripts are put on
[53:35.640 --> 53:51.320]  the news other fake transcripts are pumped out everywhere so now they're having secret
[53:51.320 --> 53:57.560]  events now they're having the Democrat run house is having closed door meetings where
[53:57.560 --> 54:02.360]  no questions can be asked and the Republicans aren't let in and then ship can just make
[54:02.360 --> 54:07.240]  up whatever he wants and then put out statements about what was found oh bombshell they confirm
[54:07.240 --> 54:12.280]  it all it's all real and it's all about you never Trumpers who go well actually I heard
[54:12.280 --> 54:16.960]  from an unnamed third party Trump said you've got to give me something if I give you something
[54:16.960 --> 54:20.160]  but the actual transcript all the witnesses say that's not true and I don't know if it's
[54:20.160 --> 54:25.400]  true so there's this imaginary witness that no one can question no one can see and now
[54:25.400 --> 54:29.400]  the whistleblower can't be talked to is I predicted when this all broke it doesn't exist
[54:29.400 --> 54:34.280]  it's them all just making it up but never saying who first said it so they don't get
[54:34.280 --> 54:41.320]  charged with making the false statements the FBI and Congress and others it's a desperate
[54:41.320 --> 54:50.400]  criminal attempt to 2.0 and here's what the president had to say about it on Friday as
[54:50.400 --> 54:55.320]  you know there's been a long term look at look see and it looks like it's becoming very
[54:55.320 --> 55:01.320]  serious from what I'm hearing investigate the investigators whether it's struck and
[55:01.320 --> 55:08.720]  paid whether it's flopper and whether it's homey and all of these people because terrible
[55:08.720 --> 55:14.240]  things went on for our country and we have a great attorney general highly prestigious
[55:14.240 --> 55:19.200]  man a very honorable man and they've been looking at it for a long time I can't tell
[55:19.200 --> 55:24.560]  you what's happening I will tell you this I think you're gonna see a lot of really bad
[55:24.560 --> 55:30.440]  things and a lot of people think that and they know they have problems because they
[55:30.440 --> 55:36.000]  were very dishonest and again I leave it all up to the attorney general and I leave it
[55:36.000 --> 55:41.320]  all up to the people that are working with the attorney general who I don't know but
[55:41.320 --> 55:45.560]  I will say this I think you'll see things that nobody would have believed Robert Barnes
[55:45.560 --> 55:50.400]  here with a special Saturday breaking news report and information again deep insight
[55:50.400 --> 56:01.360]  dynamite 30 minute report no ads in it dynamite dynamite dynamite he just top constitutional

[57:38.880 --> 57:43.960]  individually or together and with bio tricillinium they all fuse together and it supports the
[57:43.960 --> 57:48.560]  info war we got a huge mega cell that's got has to end very very soon to take advantage
[57:48.560 --> 57:53.520]  of it today at info or store.com and find out about iodine think our info is powerful

[58:05.360 --> 58:12.320]  like the fact that God gave you all families and children and so we want to tell you something
[58:12.320 --> 58:17.040]  right now Christian countries we took control of you over a hundred years ago we've been
[58:17.040 --> 58:24.440]  spiking your water with fluoride and lower your fertility and it works so well but now
[58:24.440 --> 58:29.600]  because of liability and because of people warning inside the government what's happening
[58:29.600 --> 58:34.280]  the Journal of American Medical Association and others are admitting what we've done it
[58:34.280 --> 58:39.280]  makes me so angry so whatever you do just stay in that haze and drink fluoride and give
[58:39.280 --> 58:46.800]  it to your children and don't visit info war store.com and learn about the iodine conspiracy
[58:46.800 --> 58:52.440]  and get 60% off on x2 and x3 together with bio tricillinium from the mustard seed submit
[58:52.440 --> 59:02.120]  to us infowarstore.com again I'm not talking down to the info wars audience but I've been
[59:02.120 --> 59:06.880]  banging my head against a wall for a long time on this and I'm talking about fluoride
[59:06.880 --> 59:12.280]  and I'm talking about iodine now if you have a boat a motorboat let's say an old glass
[59:12.280 --> 59:18.800]  tron boat and you want to take it on the lake you've got to have a lake to put it in if
[59:18.800 --> 59:24.080]  you're a human being you've got to have oxygen to live okay it's the same thing well ladies
[59:24.080 --> 59:28.880]  and gentlemen the bad halogen is fluoride that's why in every western nation they put
[59:28.880 --> 59:32.600]  it in the water they're going to teach us christians lay down and die the chai cons
[59:32.600 --> 59:36.320]  don't put it in the water they'd execute you if you did that they put iodine in the
[59:36.320 --> 59:41.880]  water because it's the good halogen and increases fertility and lifespan and intelligence and
[59:41.880 --> 59:47.240]  everything else so again learn about the iodine conspiracy at infowarstore.com we have all
[59:47.240 --> 59:51.560]  the documents and articles linked and then get good iodine for yourself because the globalists
[59:51.560 --> 1:00:00.920]  are fighting to make sure you don't again get iodine at infowarstore.com you're listening
[1:00:00.920 --> 1:00:19.600]  to the alex jones show leading a frontal assault on the lives of the new world order
[1:00:19.600 --> 1:00:29.440]  it's alex jones by the way I'm not doing this to credit cliffhanger I said I'd hit the
[1:00:29.440 --> 1:00:34.840]  soros is it six after but I don't want to make callers hold I'm gonna go to callers
[1:00:34.840 --> 1:00:41.200]  this segment and the next and the next and then at the bottom of the hour I'm gonna hit
[1:00:41.200 --> 1:00:47.160]  the soros news you know why I'm gonna do that I had highlighted four different articles
[1:00:47.160 --> 1:00:54.720]  at my house today and then I realized just now that I had forgotten to bring those and
[1:00:54.720 --> 1:00:59.400]  so I have to reread at least two of the articles or I won't have time to cover it one segment
[1:00:59.400 --> 1:01:08.160]  I was just trying during that two minute break to read two of the articles and I just didn't
[1:01:08.160 --> 1:01:12.160]  have time to highlight them both so that's why I'm not gonna cover it in a few minutes
[1:01:12.160 --> 1:01:18.040]  because I'm not ready I just I just can't do it sorry I kind of over prepare sometimes
[1:01:18.040 --> 1:01:21.640]  and then do things like forget the research I mean like a third of the time I just had
[1:01:21.640 --> 1:01:28.760]  papers everywhere and just phone calls and just I'm not complaining I just it's crazy
[1:01:28.760 --> 1:01:34.480]  and I don't want to just tell you what soros is up to I want you to hear it from him because
[1:01:34.480 --> 1:01:38.360]  I was intending Friday when all this broke after I got went off here to cover it Barnes
[1:01:38.360 --> 1:01:47.360]  covered it some Saturday to you know get to it and then boom I got sent a video through
[1:01:47.360 --> 1:01:53.240]  a friend that a listener put together of soros talking about being a Nazi collaborator and
[1:01:53.240 --> 1:01:57.000]  just the way they put it together from 60 minutes you've all probably seen the video
[1:01:57.000 --> 1:02:01.560]  but the way you put it together is extremely informative so I'll do that at the bottom
[1:02:01.560 --> 1:02:06.080]  of the hour and then we'll continue with calls in the fifth segment but the second third
[1:02:06.080 --> 1:02:11.280]  segment are coming up and I will go to your calls then in fact I'll go to some calls

[1:03:56.000 --> 1:04:01.080]  and all you guys talking about living defense let me tell you something man I had an internal
[1:04:01.080 --> 1:04:05.520]  digestive problem and I suffered with it for about five or six years and the doctors they
[1:04:05.520 --> 1:04:10.360]  tried every test nobody could figure out what it is and then every day when I kept hearing

[1:06:23.560 --> 1:06:34.680]  are receiving this transmission you are the resistance all right we're taking phone calls
[1:06:34.680 --> 1:06:39.280]  steams our first caller retired Marine says that Clinton Obama McCain connections to ISIS
[1:06:39.280 --> 1:06:45.720]  it's a fact they literally ran the damn thing and protected it now MSM is mad at Trump for
[1:06:45.720 --> 1:06:50.400]  send the military to great job killing the leader of ISIS Al-Baghdadi we already played
[1:06:50.400 --> 1:06:55.240]  that compilation last hour if you just tuned in believe me you got to go see the Washington
[1:06:55.240 --> 1:07:02.080]  Post praising Al-Baghdadi as an austere good religious leader those are quotes and there's
[1:07:02.080 --> 1:07:06.480]  these compilations of them attacking Trump saying he shouldn't have taken a victory laugh
[1:07:06.480 --> 1:07:14.000]  for the military Obama and the bin Laden killing I mean that was like went on for months so
[1:07:14.000 --> 1:07:19.920]  it's getting crazy ladies and gentlemen is getting really crazy but look I'm not trying
[1:07:19.920 --> 1:07:25.040]  to infomercial here I did like a one-minute plug at the end of the last hour but Steve
[1:07:25.040 --> 1:07:30.000]  called in and was talking about if you just joined us how he was in the VA really sick
[1:07:30.000 --> 1:07:34.800]  nothing was working you got a bottle of living defense it doesn't just flush out the big
[1:07:34.800 --> 1:07:41.840]  parasites it's designed to go after all the microscopic ones and folks this I thought would
[1:07:41.840 --> 1:07:48.920]  be our best-selling product it means sold some but this is the strongest best natural
[1:07:48.920 --> 1:07:54.640]  herbal compound that'll flush your guts out okay then we've got the micro zx that gets
[1:07:54.640 --> 1:08:00.400]  out the candida the mold the yeast these people take probiotics that's great you know the
[1:08:00.400 --> 1:08:05.080]  good bacteria because as you get older a lot of the good bacteria are flushed out you take
[1:08:05.080 --> 1:08:09.800]  antibiotics it kills them all there's other toxic bacteria you know that push out the
[1:08:09.800 --> 1:08:14.480]  good bacteria so it's good to have things that are fermented or things that have a lot
[1:08:14.480 --> 1:08:20.640]  of natural bacteria I'm like yogurt or sauerkraut pickles those are all great sources naturally
[1:08:20.640 --> 1:08:24.720]  but nothing works good like a good probiotic but you got to have the other thing like a
[1:08:24.720 --> 1:08:29.080]  micro zx that flushes out the yeast the mold the candida but then to go after parasites
[1:08:29.080 --> 1:08:34.440]  well that's living defense and so this is the best you're going to find out there that's
[1:08:34.440 --> 1:08:39.440]  over the counter okay and if you go places I don't be gross but if you go places like
[1:08:39.440 --> 1:08:44.640]  cuba I've been told by everybody that goes there most beautiful women you'd ever imagined
[1:08:44.640 --> 1:08:48.560]  but they're begging for dewormer because the government won't produce it or sell it and
[1:08:48.560 --> 1:08:53.680]  people can't get it and so people are taking dewormer people go there with the dewormer
[1:08:53.680 --> 1:08:58.840]  and people you just don't do anything for it you know cases of guards women or whatever
[1:08:58.840 --> 1:09:02.960]  just for you know for the dewormer pretty gross right but that's how it is in communist
[1:09:02.960 --> 1:09:07.320]  countries well there's all sorts of stuff out there that the medical system won't tell
[1:09:07.320 --> 1:09:11.200]  you about and so we're not competing with their death traps and what they're doing we're
[1:09:11.200 --> 1:09:16.400]  just saying living defense and so you were talking about what happened just briefly this
[1:09:16.400 --> 1:09:20.520]  will help a lot of folks who were saying people especially military that have been overseas
[1:09:20.520 --> 1:09:26.720]  tell us about it Steve well Alice I'm telling you every listener out there should order
[1:09:26.720 --> 1:09:31.400]  a couple bottles of this because everybody's got parasites whether you think you don't or
[1:09:31.400 --> 1:09:36.760]  not if you've ever eaten any kind of seafood anything like that obviously you do sushi
[1:09:36.760 --> 1:09:41.640]  forget about it you're riddled with parasite and I don't know of a better product and I've
[1:09:41.640 --> 1:09:46.720]  done a lot of research since I had this miraculous turnaround in my health I started looking into
[1:09:46.720 --> 1:09:50.640]  it and there's no better product out there and I really would like you to see I'd like
[1:09:50.640 --> 1:09:55.720]  to see you bring Dr. Group on maybe again or maybe a little more often because he was
[1:09:55.720 --> 1:10:02.080]  fabulous in the way he explained all the different ingredients you know the clove and the all
[1:10:02.080 --> 1:10:06.800]  the different herbs that went into the making of the product I mean just fabulous and I
[1:10:06.800 --> 1:10:12.240]  would also say Alex in conjunction with that the X2 I know you talk a lot about the survival
[1:10:12.240 --> 1:10:17.520]  shield and the good halogen but man I cannot over emphasize that when I started using that
[1:10:17.520 --> 1:10:22.720]  I'm 63 going on 20 and and you know the doctors had pretty much given up on me they didn't
[1:10:22.720 --> 1:10:27.120]  think that I would ever make a rebound and I didn't ever think of myself doing you know
[1:10:27.120 --> 1:10:32.160]  I'd call in into your show and talking to you just full of energy and vibrance and I was so much
[1:10:32.160 --> 1:10:36.880]  of it even to info wars man so I'm just telling everybody out there get that freaking live in
[1:10:36.880 --> 1:10:42.480]  defense and give it a shot because you you and what what you know I don't want to be gross either
[1:10:42.480 --> 1:10:48.080]  else like you always are saying but you know what came out of my body was that it amazed me
[1:10:48.080 --> 1:10:52.480]  and I'll tell you Dr. Group's a great guy and I'm not at liberty to say what he went through
[1:10:53.520 --> 1:10:56.880]  and I can still get him on the show but he just went through so much that I just said look
[1:10:56.880 --> 1:11:02.400]  they're coming after you too hard his family after him they had infiltrators and I'm not
[1:11:03.280 --> 1:11:06.800]  I'm not going to tell you what went on but imagine they can't get me to back down
[1:11:07.360 --> 1:11:11.280]  so imagine what they do to anybody I'm associated with and that's really the saddest part about
[1:11:11.280 --> 1:11:16.560]  this is that they didn't just have New York Times infiltrators try to get into here
[1:11:16.560 --> 1:11:22.640]  or Buzzfeed infiltrators he got infiltrators and God bless him and he dealt with it but
[1:11:22.640 --> 1:11:28.400]  but we're dealing with criminal organizations we're fighting I mean people don't stand they're on
[1:11:28.400 --> 1:11:33.920]  TV saying that Miller you know she wishes Rand Paul had been killed when six ribs were broken
[1:11:33.920 --> 1:11:38.800]  it pierced his lung I knew the inside baseball that he was very very sick and could have died
[1:11:38.800 --> 1:11:46.080]  I mean that I mean a rib went into his lung okay guys and so they shot Scalise it's just hellish
[1:11:46.080 --> 1:11:54.320]  and I and we've got to defeat but we've got to defeat these people God bless you I appreciate your call
[1:11:54.880 --> 1:12:01.920]  yeah Dr. groups amazing he helped us launch so much of this okay I want to go to more your calls
[1:12:01.920 --> 1:12:05.680]  I end up giving that felt like seven eight minutes the last segment part of this one he's great
[1:12:05.680 --> 1:12:09.360]  but I want to get to the other callers and I want you to tell us how you love the
[1:12:09.360 --> 1:12:16.800]  products and that's great but we've got to get to the news I'm not discouraging it but at the same
[1:12:16.800 --> 1:12:23.440]  time people just need to know that we're not making this up just like our informations game changing
[1:12:23.440 --> 1:12:28.480]  the products are game changing and I was actually shocked to see how much living defense is on the
[1:12:28.480 --> 1:12:33.360]  site I told you I'm selling out of everything in our stockpile right now just to keep ourselves
[1:12:33.360 --> 1:12:43.200]  funded and living defense is 995 that's a typo I guess it's up there 100% reviews I happen to
[1:12:43.200 --> 1:12:51.120]  know that living defense cost us $19 a bottle so I've been so busy that that's another one of my
[1:12:51.120 --> 1:12:55.120]  mistakes right there they just put it up there I'm looking at the shopping cart I'm like $9.95
[1:12:55.120 --> 1:13:04.480]  I'm gonna call my web people now I'm gonna say uh $24.95 we need to make $5 on that so
[1:13:05.680 --> 1:13:10.560]  let me explain how this works I do all the marketing I'm not market trained here I'm going to get the
[1:13:10.560 --> 1:13:15.440]  best products bring them to you where the average multivitamin has $5 a product you know ours has
[1:13:15.440 --> 1:13:22.160]  15 in it or the average uh coq 10 or pqq you know might cost 50 bucks but it's got $5 a product in
[1:13:22.160 --> 1:13:28.320]  it they're amazing ours has you know 30 40 bucks a product in it that's what we do our colloidal
[1:13:28.320 --> 1:13:33.280]  silvers the same stuff they sell at Whole Foods their top-end brand they sell for $25 all day
[1:13:33.280 --> 1:13:40.560]  we always sell for 19 it's 995 right now okay so that's the level of these products
[1:13:42.000 --> 1:13:45.200]  and they're all the best ladies and gentlemen they're all the very best you're going to find
[1:13:45.200 --> 1:13:51.680]  anywhere at infowarstore.com so again I'm not going to talk about the products anymore because we'll
[1:13:51.680 --> 1:13:58.160]  never have time to get to all these calls we got all bases loaded here we had this raid killing this
[1:13:58.160 --> 1:14:03.360]  ISIS leader Trump is taking out an ISIS in al Qaeda he's not supporting it he's ended those
[1:14:03.360 --> 1:14:08.240]  policies of Obama and Hillary in the deep state helping them that we pioneered exposing this now
[1:14:08.240 --> 1:14:12.800]  mainstream news and so yes I believe Trump did this because I've seen Trump really deliver on
[1:14:12.800 --> 1:14:19.280]  what he says he'll do and or explain why he can't get it done because he's being blocked and I told
[1:14:19.280 --> 1:14:23.600]  you he'd never really actually support red flag laws now he said again today he's not supporting
[1:14:23.600 --> 1:14:27.920]  him but he wants to look into mental health and deal with that you know the globalists are hopping
[1:14:27.920 --> 1:14:32.960]  mad because we're actually taking these groups out not supporting them and Saudi Arabia is no
[1:14:32.960 --> 1:14:38.240]  longer supporting them so the whole globalist system of destabilizing the planet by building up
[1:14:38.240 --> 1:14:44.480]  dictators and then supporting communist China and backing ISIS and al Qaeda it's over it's over
[1:14:44.480 --> 1:14:50.320]  so we're going to go to break and we're going to come back and we're going to take your phone calls
[1:14:51.040 --> 1:14:55.040]  here bam bam bam but I've just got time to give each caller a few minutes here
[1:14:55.040 --> 1:15:01.120]  so we're going to go to Khalid when we come back and then we're going to go to Sean right through
[1:15:01.840 --> 1:15:07.040]  these callers we've got Chris wants to talk about Roger Stone and marijuana from the interview on
[1:15:07.040 --> 1:15:15.920]  Friday here's how this works a lot of times I just have totally open phones
[1:15:18.640 --> 1:15:22.400]  and then sometimes I say hey I just want first time callers some new callers can get on like that
[1:15:22.400 --> 1:15:28.800]  last great caller and then I'm like hey let's talk about the raid let's talk about the attempted
[1:15:28.800 --> 1:15:33.040]  coup against Trump and the fact there is now a criminal investigation of the fake russia gate
[1:15:33.040 --> 1:15:38.080]  attempted coup that that's a huge area but people are calling about other subjects and I don't want
[1:15:38.080 --> 1:15:42.960]  to be mean about it it's just like okay fine we'll do it but only a minute on the marijuana
[1:15:42.960 --> 1:15:47.840]  subject okay but we'll do it we'll go to chris if it's okay I'm not trying to slap you down I'm
[1:15:47.840 --> 1:15:52.640]  just saying I want to just bam bam bam but some of these subjects you got to explain it to people
[1:15:52.640 --> 1:15:59.200]  you got to lay them out but um all right we'll be right back on the other side of this quick break
[1:15:59.200 --> 1:16:05.200]  and there's so much more that I haven't gotten to yet wait till I get to this news on please listen
[1:16:05.200 --> 1:16:10.320]  to this information because it can save your life and it can save the life of others there
[1:16:10.320 --> 1:16:14.400]  couldn't be more critical information for your physical body god's more important when it comes
[1:16:14.400 --> 1:16:20.240]  to your soul but this is most important when it comes to your body if people didn't know that you
[1:16:20.240 --> 1:16:26.560]  put motor oil in a car's oil container to lube the engine they might be able to be conned and think
[1:16:26.560 --> 1:16:31.440]  you put salt water in it but it would seize up the engine pretty much instantly well if they put
[1:16:31.440 --> 1:16:36.800]  fluoride in the human body it causes cancer dumps us down and destroys fertility if you put the good
[1:16:36.800 --> 1:16:42.800]  halogen in the body high quality iodine it's like putting good high quality motor oil in the car
[1:16:42.800 --> 1:16:46.960]  it's supposed to run on it it's that simple find out about the iodine conspiracy and info or store
[1:16:46.960 --> 1:16:51.280]  dot com and find out what the globalist hope that you do not research this information ladies and
[1:16:51.280 --> 1:16:57.200]  gentlemen whatever you do research iodine deficiency it's the key to everything and then
[1:16:57.200 --> 1:17:01.840]  go and take advantage of the 60 off combo with our two different types of high quality iodine
[1:17:01.840 --> 1:17:07.440]  and bio tricillinium and for store dot com today now what i'm about to say is incredibly obvious
[1:17:07.440 --> 1:17:11.680]  and i'm not talking down to any of the viewers or any of the listeners i'm just taking the facts
[1:17:11.680 --> 1:17:17.120]  i own a chainsaw i've had it since i was in college and it's a great good old chainsaw and i've used
[1:17:17.120 --> 1:17:23.600]  it probably 500 times but a few times i've forgotten to oil it and it seizes up really quick and i
[1:17:23.600 --> 1:17:29.840]  feel like an idiot for not oiling it now imagine if somebody told me to put let's say super glue
[1:17:30.400 --> 1:17:35.520]  in the oil container on it it would seize up forever but only an evil person would do that well
[1:17:35.520 --> 1:17:39.920]  fluoride's like putting super glue at a chainsaw it's going to make it seize up and that's why
[1:17:39.920 --> 1:17:43.520]  they put it in the water and they admit they're doing it to hurt you and your family yes they're
[1:17:43.520 --> 1:17:49.200]  really evil iodine is like putting oil in the chainsaw to help with the gasoline lubrication
[1:17:49.200 --> 1:17:53.760]  it's that simple i know you understand this but let's warn other people before it's too late
[1:17:53.760 --> 1:17:58.960]  it's part of the iodine conspiracy find out more at info or store dot com and take action against

[1:18:05.360 --> 1:18:11.040]  it is now an admitted fact fluoride out of the water has caused tens of millions of americans
[1:18:11.040 --> 1:18:16.720]  to be brain damaged and to have infertility and low IQs and it doesn't matter if the journal of
[1:18:16.720 --> 1:18:21.280]  american medical association comes out and says it's terrible still the city's put it in the water
[1:18:21.280 --> 1:18:26.240]  because the ruling globalists want you and your family poisoned and stupid and they sure don't
[1:18:26.240 --> 1:18:33.440]  want you to know about the good allergen iodine that absolutely increases IQ and fertility and

[1:19:22.800 --> 1:19:28.000]  and it causes cancer that was just one of thousands of studies admitting this you know it's illegal
[1:19:28.000 --> 1:19:32.960]  to have even one part per billion in the water in places like california unless it's part of
[1:19:32.960 --> 1:19:37.760]  adding fluoride and then they have a waiver and can add thousands of deadly chemicals
[1:19:37.760 --> 1:19:43.520]  to your water because the liberals love you and they want to sexualize your children so whatever

[1:21:31.120 --> 1:21:38.880]  for that i thank you brother we're in this together i was once ignorant absolutely um anyway alex um
[1:21:38.880 --> 1:21:44.880]  so the mainstream media is apparently criticizing the president because he is calling abu bhakar
[1:21:44.880 --> 1:21:49.360]  abu bhakati a dog well he is a dog and he is a coward and i'm glad he's dead he deserves it
[1:21:51.280 --> 1:21:56.560]  i mean i get under islam dogs are seen as dirty so maybe that's an insult that way i i just i think
[1:21:56.560 --> 1:22:02.480]  he's worse than a dog more i mean like blew his three kids up with him reportedly well i mean i mean
[1:22:03.360 --> 1:22:07.040]  alex i can tell you he's in hell right now for what he did because why would you take your kids
[1:22:07.040 --> 1:22:12.800]  with you they're innocent what do they have to do with you well i agree the guys are coward you
[1:22:12.800 --> 1:22:17.360]  know he had people march out and and and do the killing for him of innocence he wouldn't do it
[1:22:17.360 --> 1:22:24.560]  himself what do you make of the washington post calling him austere and a religious monk a leader
[1:22:24.560 --> 1:22:31.040]  or about a bunch of sickening stuff let me put the exact quote absolutely retarded what do you
[1:22:31.040 --> 1:22:36.000]  mean he's a religious scholar are you are you kidding me blowing yourself up like you what
[1:22:36.000 --> 1:22:43.120]  you're not supposed to that's a big no no an austere religious leader absolutely where do you
[1:22:43.120 --> 1:22:47.760]  think this is going now because they're demonizing trump that he said our military did a good job
[1:22:47.760 --> 1:22:54.000]  that you never do that obama did endless victory laps on the whole bin laden thing well alex you're
[1:22:54.000 --> 1:23:00.480]  right about osama bin laden being dead for a long time um you're the one who who exposed that so
[1:23:00.480 --> 1:23:07.040]  i mean that whole raid was a bar and then them keep killing seal team six i mean you you talked
[1:23:07.040 --> 1:23:11.840]  about that a long time ago that's what i remember so i mean biggest loss ever they blew the helicopter
[1:23:11.840 --> 1:23:20.480]  up absolutely absolutely um i think i think alex president trump he's taken his gloves off and
[1:23:20.480 --> 1:23:25.840]  and i know he's trying but you've been talking about it he has the evil bureaucracy and all
[1:23:25.840 --> 1:23:30.720]  these evil people that don't want him to succeed but let me tell you he's going to win 2020 and
[1:23:30.720 --> 1:23:36.960]  he's going to keep on succeeding because god and the people were with him and and well i think god
[1:23:36.960 --> 1:23:40.400]  is with trump but we've got to support trump we've got to keep trouble to straighten arrow and help
[1:23:40.400 --> 1:23:44.960]  him but i totally agree god bless you thank you khalid all right let's go to a caller in the great
[1:23:44.960 --> 1:23:52.960]  state of nebraska let's go to shan in nebraska welcome sir hello alex long time with their first
[1:23:52.960 --> 1:23:58.160]  time caller i'd like i would just like to say you are one badass you know what i appreciate
[1:23:58.160 --> 1:24:04.640]  talking to you i'll make this quick i just want to get your opinion on the media making this guy
[1:24:04.640 --> 1:24:10.160]  was killed today such a great person i was just wondering if this this is finally the nail in
[1:24:10.160 --> 1:24:15.760]  the coffin for the establishment to finally by the way i woke up this morning and and heard about it
[1:24:16.720 --> 1:24:22.720]  and then i started seeing the headlines that the media was attacking trump that they were
[1:24:22.720 --> 1:24:27.280]  basically saying praising him and i didn't believe it till i saw it i mean that's like
[1:24:27.280 --> 1:24:32.560]  the joke saying that if trump cured cancer people would say how dare him but they're literally
[1:24:32.560 --> 1:24:38.800]  now basically on the side of this jihadi yeah and and as a stage three survivor of cancer
[1:24:38.800 --> 1:24:45.040]  i would support him fully i just i think that i think the establishment is now scared that they
[1:24:45.040 --> 1:24:49.680]  took their top leader down this there could be isis whistleblowers there to be lower-ranked members
[1:24:50.720 --> 1:24:55.280]  you know all the thousands of fighters that are going back home now they could be exposing these
[1:24:55.280 --> 1:24:59.040]  people and i think they're scared i think they're making them trying to sound so great
[1:24:59.040 --> 1:25:04.160]  so it distracts us to think that they're not nothing bad and totally i didn't oh wow because
[1:25:04.160 --> 1:25:08.800]  we know obama and hillary did fun and that came out even in congress and mccain was overseeing and
[1:25:08.800 --> 1:25:13.840]  he was photographed with these guys wow that's a good point and this will finally bring that to
[1:25:13.840 --> 1:25:18.960]  light i believe and when trump was in his first was his campaign he said i thought he was crazy
[1:25:18.960 --> 1:25:24.720]  obama and clinton created isis now that isis is gone well maybe gone or their leader's gone maybe
[1:25:24.720 --> 1:25:30.560]  this will finally expose through a whistleblower through maybe getting leaning linear sentences
[1:25:30.560 --> 1:25:35.280]  for these fighters that maybe some stuff will finally come out and also quick question for you
[1:25:35.840 --> 1:25:40.240]  trump asked talks about protecting the oil the precious oil i've seen a video on youtube about
[1:25:40.240 --> 1:25:45.920]  the petroleum conspiracy i want your opinion on this i the video i've seen it said petroleum this man
[1:25:45.920 --> 1:25:50.400]  said petroleum was the second largest mineral in the world next to water but they called it fossil
[1:25:50.400 --> 1:25:59.280]  fuel to make it sound absolutely no they've proven that some oil uh is from dead animals but a lot of
[1:25:59.280 --> 1:26:06.080]  it uh is not from dead animals that's a fact they had to admit that like 70 years ago and oil wells
[1:26:06.080 --> 1:26:11.040]  that have been emptied are filling back up everywhere and so there's a big mystery to this
[1:26:11.040 --> 1:26:16.960]  and it's it's it's it's uh really really really crazy so there's probiotic oil and then there's
[1:26:16.960 --> 1:26:21.360]  i guess it's abiotic it's been a while since i studied it but yes i've got a lot of family that's
[1:26:21.360 --> 1:26:27.040]  in a petroleum and and the point is is that there's more and more oil they're finding all the time
[1:26:27.040 --> 1:26:33.360]  there it is the mysterious origin and supply of oil thank you god bless you you know who's been
[1:26:33.360 --> 1:26:37.440]  funding peak oil the saudi arabians you know who's been funding the anti-fracking movement
[1:26:37.440 --> 1:26:42.880]  the saudi arabians because they don't want competition they've been funding the move to
[1:26:42.880 --> 1:26:47.280]  restrict u.s carbon you go but wait a minute they're one of the big exporters of it it's all being
[1:26:47.280 --> 1:26:54.240]  done selective it's only gonna ban american exploration of carbon we will pay the carbon tax
[1:26:54.240 --> 1:27:01.120]  the saudi's and the chinese don't i watched the so-called republican candidate debate it was more
[1:27:01.120 --> 1:27:05.360]  vicious than the democrats how they're gonna ban guns how they're gonna have carbon taxes how they're
[1:27:05.360 --> 1:27:12.880]  gonna arrest trump uh it was just disgusting to watch it but what do you expect okay let's take
[1:27:12.880 --> 1:27:17.760]  another caller here let's go to michael in california thank you for holding go ahead

[1:28:08.880 --> 1:28:15.440]  pill the media's criticism today only shows you know that the president did the right thing you know
[1:28:15.440 --> 1:28:21.040]  like you've always said you know you know men based on whose enemies it based on who his enemies are
[1:28:21.040 --> 1:28:28.000]  you know that's a great point uh do you think they've jumped the shark here bad-mouthing
[1:28:28.000 --> 1:28:34.160]  trump over this it just it's crazy no i think it's part of their plan you know their journal
[1:28:34.160 --> 1:28:39.360]  terrorist media they're constantly defending authoritarianism hedonism globalism and now the
[1:28:39.360 --> 1:28:45.840]  leader of ices calling them you know the austere religious leader i mean come on really the brain
[1:28:45.840 --> 1:28:50.240]  washing still over the top it's hard to understand why we haven't completely overthoned it by now
[1:28:51.200 --> 1:28:54.880]  i think you're right and they know they have to do the indefensible so they're just doubling
[1:28:54.880 --> 1:28:58.880]  down their gas lighting is and the question is why are they still there i totally agree with you
[1:28:58.880 --> 1:29:05.600]  thank you michael chris donna matt danny your calls bw jimmy stay with us
[1:29:06.160 --> 1:29:14.880]  hello here my name is buffon i work for my father lucifer and he doesn't like the fact that god gave
[1:29:14.880 --> 1:29:22.240]  you all families and children and so we want to tell you something right now christian countries
[1:29:22.240 --> 1:29:27.280]  we took control of you over a hundred years ago we've been spiking your water with fluoride
[1:29:27.280 --> 1:29:33.920]  and lower your fertility and it hurts you and it's worked so well but now because of liability
[1:29:33.920 --> 1:29:39.040]  and because of people warning inside the government what's happening the general of american medical
[1:29:39.040 --> 1:29:44.240]  association and others are admitting what we've done and it makes me so angry so whatever you do
[1:29:44.240 --> 1:29:51.440]  just stay in that haze and drink fluoride and give it to your children and don't visit info
[1:29:51.440 --> 1:29:57.200]  war store dot com and learn about the iodine conspiracy and get 60 off on x2 and x3 together
[1:29:57.200 --> 1:30:07.120]  with bio tricillinium from the mustard seed submit to us info war store dot com again i'm not talking
[1:30:07.120 --> 1:30:13.040]  down to the info wars audience but i've been banging my head against a wall for a long time on this
[1:30:13.040 --> 1:30:19.200]  and i'm talking about fluoride and i'm talking about iodine now if you have a boat a motor boat
[1:30:19.200 --> 1:30:24.960]  let's say an old glass tron boat and you want to take it on the lake you've got to have a lake to
[1:30:24.960 --> 1:30:31.680]  put it in if you're a human being you've got to have oxygen to live okay it's the same thing well
[1:30:31.680 --> 1:30:36.800]  ladies and gentlemen the bad halogen is fluoride that's why in every western nation they put it
[1:30:36.800 --> 1:30:40.960]  in the water they're going to teach us christians lay down and die the chi coms don't put it in the
[1:30:40.960 --> 1:30:46.240]  water they'd execute you if you did that they put iodine in the water because it's the good halogen
[1:30:46.240 --> 1:30:51.840]  and increases fertility and lifespan and intelligence and everything else so again learn about the
[1:30:51.840 --> 1:30:57.200]  iodine conspiracy at infowarstore.com we have all the documents and articles linked and then get

[1:31:28.560 --> 1:31:33.280]  conspiracy and then once you've learned about it protects yourself and your family the reason i'm
[1:31:33.280 --> 1:31:38.240]  so hot on this is the globalists put the fluoride in the water while making sure we don't get the
[1:31:38.240 --> 1:31:43.280]  iodine in china they put the iodine in the water and ban the fluoride because they've already got

[1:37:30.000 --> 1:37:36.160]  set it all up but they just talked to us like we're totally idiotic yeah there's facebook's now
[1:37:36.160 --> 1:37:40.400]  this saying it's anti-semitic what that what is what does that have to do with jews they always
[1:37:40.400 --> 1:37:47.520]  inject race into these things this is crazy but again we're winning because now they have to
[1:37:47.520 --> 1:37:54.320]  just admit the whole thing let's talk to danie now in washington state danie thanks for holding

[1:38:05.040 --> 1:38:11.920]  now i'm behind enemy lines either way yes sir hey i just wanted to say thank you so much uh
[1:38:11.920 --> 1:38:17.440]  really appreciate what you're doing got my 51st shirt uh state shirt today uh looks incredible
[1:38:17.440 --> 1:38:25.840]  great fit high quality uh so uh yeah about the bag daddy takedown um you know i'm so so happy that
[1:38:25.840 --> 1:38:32.160]  trump did that under the radar and very careful uh communicating with the military and the generals
[1:38:32.160 --> 1:38:39.760]  of the people involved keep it away from congress and skeletor Pelosi exactly you know they would have
[1:38:39.760 --> 1:38:44.880]  obviously something to happen where we're gonna have troops killed he would have gotten away
[1:38:45.680 --> 1:38:49.520]  they would have put him in jail in a prison and then he would have disappeared like uh
[1:38:50.320 --> 1:38:56.640]  esti whatever he would have been well we know the previous raids isis uh was was was waiting
[1:38:56.640 --> 1:39:01.200]  since trump got in and we know that leftists have been leaking it to them because they used to command
[1:39:01.200 --> 1:39:06.480]  them of course they're trying to protect their little terrorist army that they use as an excuse
[1:39:06.480 --> 1:39:12.000]  to invade countries trumps is getting rid of the problem oh and it caught them totally on guard i mean
[1:39:12.800 --> 1:39:18.240]  they almost did i'm feeling they've got to be looking back at their martyrization of this guy
[1:39:18.240 --> 1:39:24.640]  i think and while we maybe we acted too soon i mean we just they had no idea what to do you know
[1:39:24.640 --> 1:39:30.240]  and i noticed that everybody on the you know the leftist army out there is just complaining about
[1:39:30.240 --> 1:39:36.080]  the situation room photo saying oh it looks like a photo op trump is probably not there and
[1:39:36.080 --> 1:39:42.320]  exactly the moment since when is a political photo op with the members of his cabinet and
[1:39:42.320 --> 1:39:47.840]  the general conspiracy well sure i mean i've seen probably ten clips of that we had time to play
[1:39:47.840 --> 1:39:51.840]  like six or seven they're saying how dare him politicize this is unheard of and then meanwhile
[1:39:51.840 --> 1:39:56.960]  obama grandstanding way worse than trump ever did it's just crazy i mean do they think were that
[1:39:56.960 --> 1:40:03.840]  stupid i guess they do i guess so you know i mean living in a place like portland it's kind of sad
[1:40:03.840 --> 1:40:10.240]  they are a lot of people are that asleep but i have noticed you know if you get them on one on
[1:40:10.240 --> 1:40:14.720]  one and you start talking to them i wear a lot of info war shirts i mean that everybody i know
[1:40:14.720 --> 1:40:19.920]  i work with kind of gives me a hard time as they they know i'm a fan they just don't get it but the
[1:40:19.920 --> 1:40:25.040]  more i talk to these people the more you know they they start kind of leaking out that they think the
[1:40:25.040 --> 1:40:31.040]  whole transgender progressive nonsense is nonsense and and it's going too far but there's you know
[1:40:31.040 --> 1:40:34.880]  it's like a whisper they're just like i do i do think that's kind of crazy but they don't want
[1:40:34.880 --> 1:40:39.360]  anyone to know yeah like why should every major sport that women have be dominated by men
[1:40:41.200 --> 1:40:45.360]  who say they're women i mean this is ridiculous this is this is don't quote
[1:40:45.360 --> 1:40:49.280]  feminists yet they're having their whole space taken over by a bunch of creepy men
[1:40:49.280 --> 1:40:55.280]  i've had a co-worker that's gay co-worker that's a lesbian with a shaved head and she's
[1:40:55.280 --> 1:40:58.160]  saying man i just gotta get out of portland it's so ridiculous
[1:40:59.280 --> 1:41:04.640]  she just you know these people and they're part of the you know gay i feel like they've
[1:41:04.640 --> 1:41:10.960]  got to be really resentful of the lgbt uh crowd now because they just kind of took over their
[1:41:10.960 --> 1:41:16.160]  movement of just wanting to not be you know just be accepted and have people not be bad
[1:41:16.160 --> 1:41:20.720]  exactly that whole movement has been people just wanting to be treated equal has been hijacked
[1:41:20.720 --> 1:41:27.120]  by the whole leftist agenda because because americans are are open and and so again they
[1:41:27.120 --> 1:41:31.520]  are open this has been used against us thank you so much great points danie well that was
[1:41:31.520 --> 1:41:36.000]  another great caller and i've got chris and i've got matt and i've got bj and i've got jim
[1:41:36.000 --> 1:41:40.320]  and i want to get to everybody let's cram in another one here let's go to chris in pennsylvania
[1:41:40.320 --> 1:41:45.680]  what's about roger stone in the friday interview go ahead chris alex hey buddy great
[1:41:45.680 --> 1:41:51.920]  talk to you yes sir it's such an honor sir thank you go ahead the touchpoint is great
[1:41:51.920 --> 1:41:56.320]  abin roger on the show the other day it was nice seeing him again oh yeah that was a big deal him
[1:41:56.320 --> 1:42:02.480]  coming on he could they're trying to put him in prison for a speech right now oh i know it's
[1:42:02.480 --> 1:42:07.600]  ridiculous i can't talk anymore in america i don't know what happened here but i just wanted
[1:42:07.600 --> 1:42:12.800]  to touch point real quick about the decriminalization message that she sent the president and i think
[1:42:12.800 --> 1:42:18.480]  it's a incredibly smart message that she sent to him because it just needs to be decriminalized
[1:42:18.480 --> 1:42:24.720]  and i think it would change public opinion towards the president don't you well he already told the
[1:42:24.720 --> 1:42:29.520]  federal government to leave marijuana legalization of the states and that's something obama said he
[1:42:29.520 --> 1:42:33.600]  do and didn't do so he's pretty much already delivered but yeah uh sessions tried to block him
[1:42:33.600 --> 1:42:38.160]  on a bunch of that and i think people have a right to do whatever they want uh marijuana is super
[1:42:38.160 --> 1:42:42.320]  strong now people better be careful but i think it should be decriminalized we shouldn't load them up
[1:42:42.320 --> 1:42:48.160]  with prison and that and trump's pretty much done that thank you so much chris that bw and jimmy

[1:46:08.400 --> 1:46:12.640]  and i'm not talking down to any of the viewers or any of the listeners i'm just stating the facts
[1:46:12.640 --> 1:46:18.080]  i own a chainsaw i've had it since i was in college and it's a great good old chainsaw and i've used
[1:46:18.080 --> 1:46:24.560]  it probably 500 times but a few times i've forgotten to oil it and it seizes up really quick and i
[1:46:24.560 --> 1:46:30.800]  feel like an idiot for not oiling it now imagine if somebody told me to put let's say super glue
[1:46:31.360 --> 1:46:36.480]  in the oil container on it it would seize up forever but only an evil person would do that well
[1:46:36.480 --> 1:46:40.880]  fluorides like putting super glue in a chainsaw it's going to make it seize up and that's why
[1:46:40.880 --> 1:46:44.480]  they put it in the water and they admit they're doing it to hurt you and your family yes they're
[1:46:44.480 --> 1:46:50.160]  really evil iodine is like putting oil in the chainsaw to help with the gasoline lubrication
[1:46:50.160 --> 1:46:54.720]  it's that simple i know you understand this but let's warn other people before it's too late

[1:48:27.040 --> 1:48:33.520]  phones up again and we're going to get into this i need to spend at least two segments on this
[1:48:33.520 --> 1:48:41.280]  to do it justice george soros has come out in the new york times interview that i need to read
[1:48:41.280 --> 1:48:46.880]  the whole thing on there because it's so sickening and everything he says is the opposite i just want
[1:48:46.880 --> 1:48:54.160]  to battle censorship and i just want freedom of speech in america he's literally second only to
[1:48:54.160 --> 1:48:59.840]  hillary financing running the suits running the group shorting facebook so they would censor
[1:48:59.840 --> 1:49:05.120]  conservatives admitting it i mean it's like saying hitler was pro-juice or was a rabbi
[1:49:05.120 --> 1:49:12.480]  and oh oh oh and how the nazis don't like him and how he battles nazis the man was a famous nazi
[1:49:12.480 --> 1:49:21.680]  collaborator but the big thing about this article is globalism a far right conspiracy theory buoyed
[1:49:21.680 --> 1:49:29.360]  by trump this is an article when trump was president elect november 16 2016 it goes on to
[1:49:29.360 --> 1:49:34.400]  attack me as the leader of the anti globalist resistance and it says that i'm insane and
[1:49:34.400 --> 1:49:40.320]  none of it exists and that no one wants to get rid of borders and no one is funding islam
[1:49:40.320 --> 1:49:44.720]  and that trump does what i tell him and that's made up but that i'm writing the talking points for
[1:49:44.720 --> 1:49:52.320]  trump well that's true so what's globalism it goes on to say it doesn't exist that i'm insane
[1:49:55.840 --> 1:49:58.960]  and that i'm dangerous and i've gotta be taken off the gear i'm gonna read the whole thing tomorrow
[1:49:58.960 --> 1:50:06.560]  there where'd the idea come from says i made it up how does america fit into it
[1:50:08.400 --> 1:50:13.040]  in the article ends mr jones then pivoted to what he thought was most important the coming
[1:50:13.040 --> 1:50:17.600]  destruction of the globalist that hijacked the country close quote primarily the news media
[1:50:17.600 --> 1:50:21.840]  international business people soon they would be destroyed once and for all not international
[1:50:21.840 --> 1:50:29.280]  business people i buy stuff from overseas it means the globalist monopoly men this is america's
[1:50:29.280 --> 1:50:34.960]  battling back to restore humanity and break the chains he said there's not gonna be any detente
[1:50:36.480 --> 1:50:40.320]  we know you're scum and we're just here to let you know you're scum
[1:50:42.080 --> 1:50:48.480]  now here's the new new york times article friday he says globalism is winning everything's wonderful
[1:50:48.480 --> 1:50:52.800]  trumps about to be gone this is like a general knowing his troops are fleeing leaving their
[1:50:52.800 --> 1:50:56.880]  weapons on the field a thousand years ago and he's saying no we're winning charge
[1:50:57.520 --> 1:51:03.040]  like custer trying to rally his troops at his last stand he did that he said everywhere wedding
[1:51:03.040 --> 1:51:10.080]  charge you know i mean you gotta hand it to soros they say oh he goes it does yes global
[1:51:10.080 --> 1:51:16.480]  government's good yes he has he's a globalist and its conspiracy theorists are people that oppose it
[1:51:16.480 --> 1:51:18.640]  it and that they're winning
[1:51:21.520 --> 1:51:25.440]  he acknowledged that it's his brand of globalism that america first is bad
[1:51:26.000 --> 1:51:31.280]  he says people tire of america first and that they understand it's the problem
[1:51:32.160 --> 1:51:37.680]  he goes on to say they will now stand up against a nationalist tendencies that are so dangerous
[1:51:37.680 --> 1:51:45.120]  it's a nation even existing is bad because they set up these international groups and
[1:51:45.120 --> 1:51:48.880]  then they run everything through them that all it doesn't set them up as kings and it goes on from
[1:51:48.880 --> 1:51:56.720]  there and the article ends with martin luther king saying the arc of moral universe is long
[1:51:56.720 --> 1:52:01.520]  but it bends towards justice soros says he doesn't agree with that he says the arc of history doesn't
[1:52:02.400 --> 1:52:09.200]  follow its own course it needs to be bent he said i am really engaged in trying to bend it in the
[1:52:09.200 --> 1:52:16.480]  right direction so he's gonna bend your arm because martin luther king said god bends towards justice
[1:52:16.480 --> 1:52:23.680]  and i've seen that it's true it in the end good outs comes out on top but no no no soros says he's
[1:52:23.680 --> 1:52:28.240]  god which he's actually said in quotes before he believes he's a messiah he's gonna bend it the
[1:52:28.240 --> 1:52:34.320]  right direction this is so heavy now i'm gonna play the most sociopathic thing you've ever heard
[1:52:34.320 --> 1:52:41.440]  this is his nineteen 98 interview with 60 minutes
[1:52:44.080 --> 1:52:49.840]  where he says that i helped the nazis i helped round up people's the best time of my life but
[1:52:49.840 --> 1:52:54.960]  if i wouldn't have done it somebody else would have done it that attitudes why eastern europe
[1:52:54.960 --> 1:53:02.160]  collapsed beneath the nazis the nazis would have tried that blitzkrieg in texas in 1940 believe me
[1:53:02.160 --> 1:53:05.680]  it had gotten stopped real quick because people wouldn't care one way or another they'd have got
[1:53:05.680 --> 1:53:10.080]  out there with their guns when the tanks rolled through and climbed up on top and killed people
[1:53:10.080 --> 1:53:14.880]  now nowadays i don't know how the texas level probably would bend over but the point is is that
[1:53:14.880 --> 1:53:22.480]  the idea that well i helped them because somebody else would is the attitude of slaves so he's
[1:53:22.480 --> 1:53:28.080]  here telling you all of this this is so evil and now he's our savior that funds the liberal movement
[1:53:28.080 --> 1:53:32.880]  and brings in all the jihadis into europe and here and all of them the guy is a monster
[1:53:33.840 --> 1:53:39.280]  so here's a video report titled project sugar daddy here it is
[1:53:42.640 --> 1:53:49.200]  i mean that's that sounds like an experience that would send lots of people to the psychiatric
[1:53:49.200 --> 1:54:01.040]  couch for many many years was it difficult not not at all not at all it was actually probably
[1:54:01.040 --> 1:54:07.920]  the happiest year of my life that year of german occupation for me it was a very positive experience
[1:54:07.920 --> 1:54:14.480]  it's a strange thing because you see incredible suffering around you and in fact you are you're
[1:54:14.480 --> 1:54:22.880]  in considerable danger yourself but you're 14 years old and you don't believe that it can
[1:54:22.880 --> 1:54:29.440]  actually touch you you have a belief in yourself your belief in your father it's a very happy
[1:54:29.440 --> 1:54:36.960]  making exhilarating experience maybe as a child you don't you don't see the connection that was
[1:54:36.960 --> 1:54:43.200]  14 years old and i would say that that's when my character was made in what way that one should
[1:54:43.200 --> 1:54:53.360]  think ahead one should understand and anticipate events and one one is threatened it was a tremendous
[1:54:53.360 --> 1:55:00.720]  threat of evil i mean it was a very personal experience of evil my understanding is that you
[1:55:00.720 --> 1:55:09.520]  went out with this protector of yours who swore that you were uh is adopted god son yes went out
[1:55:09.520 --> 1:55:17.040]  in fact and helped in the confiscation of property from the jews that's right well actually in a funny
[1:55:17.040 --> 1:55:25.280]  way it's just like in markets that if i weren't there somebody else would would be taking it away
[1:55:25.280 --> 1:55:30.800]  anyhow you know was the whether i was there or not i was only a spectator the property was being
[1:55:30.800 --> 1:55:37.440]  taken away at the center of george sorris there's an inherent contradiction which is which is on one
[1:55:37.440 --> 1:55:43.120]  hand you're the you're the capitalist who does not care about the social consequences of his act
[1:55:43.120 --> 1:55:47.680]  and on the other hand you are a philanthropist who cares only about social consequences i don't
[1:55:47.680 --> 1:55:53.920]  feel guilty because i'm engaged in an amoral activity which is not meant to have anything to
[1:55:53.920 --> 1:56:06.000]  do with guilt all right some of the great listeners put that together that's from him on 60 minutes
[1:56:06.000 --> 1:56:10.400]  any weather interviews that's not out of context the last three callers we're getting your numbers
[1:56:10.400 --> 1:56:15.200]  call me to martin a week to show i'm i'm out of time but imagine he says in the new york times
[1:56:15.200 --> 1:56:25.360]  friday i'm bending the will of the universe towards my justice god doesn't bend towards justice it
[1:56:25.360 --> 1:56:32.960]  doesn't do things for providence i'm gonna do it and the whole article is about how he's a sociopath
[1:56:32.960 --> 1:56:39.600]  but how good that is these people are sick they're lost they're evil and his son literally funds and
[1:56:39.600 --> 1:56:44.080]  runs anti-fun anti-free speech organization the documents have come out it's been in lawsuits
[1:56:45.200 --> 1:56:48.960]  they physically attack men women and children try to have free speech and he's in an article
[1:56:48.960 --> 1:56:53.280]  about how he protects free speech against trump in the right wing give me a break no one's taking
[1:56:53.280 --> 1:56:59.920]  your speech you monster you're taking ours you're an authoritarian demon drunk on the blood of the
[1:56:59.920 --> 1:57:08.400]  innocence since you are 14 years old and there is a god soros and he's going to destroy all of your
[1:57:08.400 --> 1:57:14.880]  works all of it like sand castles falling into the sea when the tide comes in the tides coming in
[1:57:16.800 --> 1:57:22.000]  the tide of nationalism is coming in and rising your tide like every other petty dictator or
[1:57:22.000 --> 1:57:28.240]  control freak is crumbling and going down you were only here to test us you talk about the will
[1:57:28.240 --> 1:57:31.840]  you don't have a will you're a slave of satan
[1:57:35.120 --> 1:57:41.280]  and jesus christ has come to free the people the captives the name of jesus christ i pray
[1:57:41.280 --> 1:57:46.960]  for judgment to come upon soros and all of his servants in the name of jesus christ and the
[1:57:46.960 --> 1:57:52.560]  authority vested in him by his father i bless you all i'll see you back tomorrow 11 am central
[1:57:52.560 --> 1:57:59.840]  reporting for duty
