[00:00.000 --> 00:11.840]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well
[00:11.840 --> 00:19.380]  so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin
[00:19.380 --> 00:28.480]  Texas Alex Jones we're live my friends it is Tuesday the 23rd day of November
[00:28.480 --> 00:36.000]  2010 we're gonna be covering the huge escalation of tensions on the Korean
[00:36.000 --> 00:42.480]  Peninsula many international news agencies are asking the question is
[00:42.480 --> 00:47.900]  this the start of the second Korean war that took tens of thousands of American
[00:47.900 --> 00:52.720]  and of course South Korean lives estimated over a half million North
[00:52.720 --> 00:57.120]  Korean and Chinese lives North Korea's military command vows of
[00:57.120 --> 01:03.500]  merciless military strike against South Korea fires artillery on to island with
[01:03.500 --> 01:11.720]  military bases and civilians killing Marines and developing the shocking
[01:11.720 --> 01:16.340]  video of the island on fire South Denies seeking redeployment of U.S.
[01:16.340 --> 01:20.900]  technical nuclear weapons the South has been of course returning fire off and on
[01:20.900 --> 01:25.980]  that stopped but an hour ago the South Korean president is saying they may go
[01:25.980 --> 01:30.800]  ahead and strike North Korea's missile bases intentionally planned attack
[01:30.800 --> 01:35.740]  Japan prepares for any eventuality China watches White House condemns the
[01:35.740 --> 01:41.900]  Russians are seeing saying we are in colossal danger and calling for both
[01:41.900 --> 01:46.460]  sides to stop what they're doing and saying that it is terrible what's
[01:46.460 --> 01:51.420]  happening of course a flashback of the UK during last week's G20 meeting in
[01:51.420 --> 01:57.820]  Seoul South Korea so they feared a North Korean attack during the G20 summit but
[01:57.820 --> 02:04.700]  none of that matters on ABC news MSNBC Fox News CNN the headline the top story
[02:04.700 --> 02:10.940]  is officials jawbone not Natalie Holloway's the Alabama teenager last
[02:10.940 --> 02:19.100]  seen five years ago in 2005 well they found a jawbone and near the Phoenix
[02:19.100 --> 02:24.700]  Hotel and that is the top story in America right now Natalie Holloway not
[02:24.700 --> 02:30.140]  these two huge militaries with nuclear weapons on both sides openly threatening
[02:30.140 --> 02:35.420]  to attack each other missile and artillery salvos going back and forth
[02:35.420 --> 02:41.980]  for several hours dead clearly on both sides civilian buildings and border
[02:41.980 --> 02:48.780]  areas smoking in fire the North says any other provocation full-scale war the
[02:48.780 --> 02:57.500]  South says any provocation full-scale war and Natalie Holloway is what matters
[02:57.500 --> 03:02.980]  today ladies and gentlemen that is what is important in this country now here's
[03:02.980 --> 03:06.220]  the larger issue and I've got Paul Watson Steve Watson and Kurt Nemo
[03:06.220 --> 03:16.140]  working on this remember 888 two years ago remember Dick Cheney basically
[03:16.140 --> 03:21.300]  ordering the attack via Georgian puppets on South Ossetia and Abkhazia in
[03:21.300 --> 03:25.900]  northern Georgia as a pretext to start war with the Russians our media ran the
[03:25.900 --> 03:29.860]  hoax that Russia had attacked preemptively was not true two days later
[03:29.860 --> 03:34.260]  they had to admit that indeed the puppet president there had launched the
[03:34.260 --> 03:39.140]  attack NATO forces were involved a day into it NATO forces were being brought
[03:39.140 --> 03:43.980]  in by C-130 from Western Europe and the Middle East the Russians rolled in
[03:43.980 --> 03:51.220]  mobile ICBM and in medium and short-range missile trucks with nuclear
[03:51.220 --> 03:54.540]  weapons their chairman the Joint Chiefs of Staff so they were preparing for
[03:54.540 --> 03:58.820]  nuclear war with Europe and warned NATO to back off the NATO forces were pulled
[03:58.820 --> 04:06.940]  out but it shows how unstable and dangerous and full of Hootspah the
[04:06.940 --> 04:12.420]  globalist are it shows how they're probing and looking for the right sign
[04:12.420 --> 04:16.660]  of weakness to kick off some type of World War 3 larger than a regional
[04:16.660 --> 04:21.820]  conflict and as big as World War 3 you know we got into Vietnam that killed
[04:21.820 --> 04:25.980]  58,000 Americans wounded over a quarter million killed over a million
[04:25.980 --> 04:31.980]  Vietnamese on both sides in 1964 with a staged attack on one of our ships
[04:31.980 --> 04:35.700]  months after Wayne Madsen confirmed it mainstream media had to admit that
[04:35.700 --> 04:40.940]  that torpedo earlier this year that blew up a South Korean ship was German made
[04:40.940 --> 04:46.220]  and during a US drill they now admit that South Korea was firing into a
[04:46.220 --> 04:50.180]  demilitarized area the North Korea claims with our with artillery in a
[04:50.180 --> 04:54.340]  drill and that's what North Korea responded to not saying North Korea is
[04:54.340 --> 04:58.380]  good either completely crazy but the issue is this looks like some type of
[04:58.380 --> 05:00.580]  provocation will break it down on the other side stay with us

[08:16.780 --> 08:21.540]  you're probably wondering why I have Fox News up on the screen they say a
[08:21.540 --> 08:27.380]  waiting demolition WTXF Philadelphia they're gonna destroy an old sports
[08:27.380 --> 08:32.220]  stadium and jaren my producer one of the producers during the break said hey how
[08:32.220 --> 08:34.500]  do you think they're gonna demolish that building and I said well the big
[08:34.500 --> 08:40.860]  lighter only takes flames now to destroy steel structures after 9-11 the
[08:40.860 --> 08:44.860]  laws of physics have been suspended he said no they're gonna fly a plane into
[08:44.860 --> 08:48.500]  a building down the block and then that's gonna make a collapse like
[08:48.500 --> 08:53.820]  building 7 so a little bit of a dark humor there for you will cut away from
[08:53.820 --> 08:58.860]  the control demolition going on there I'm sorry ladies and gentlemen we will
[08:58.860 --> 09:04.460]  not be covering Natalie Holloway that is the top story from CNN to MSNBC to
[09:04.460 --> 09:10.380]  Fox is Natalie Holloway in Aruba they found a jawbone it is not her they've
[09:10.380 --> 09:18.900]  tested the DNA okay the world is on the edge of a trigger event that could start
[09:18.900 --> 09:26.500]  World War three China has a defense pact with North Korea the United States has
[09:26.500 --> 09:31.620]  a defense pact with South Korea we lost tens of thousands of troops in the
[09:31.620 --> 09:36.180]  Korean conflict in fact guys will you pull up number of US casualties Korean
[09:36.180 --> 09:40.940]  war Korean conflict I wanted to get that number forgot to do that I want to be
[09:40.940 --> 09:45.660]  specific about it and for those just now tuning in yes we will not be talking
[09:45.660 --> 09:53.700]  about Hillary Clinton's hair or Natalie Holloway jawbones here CNBC world
[09:53.700 --> 09:58.900]  edgy on Korea Russia sees colossal danger no kidding breaking South Korea
[09:58.900 --> 10:03.940]  threatens retaliation against the North remember this story from October 30th
[10:03.940 --> 10:10.300]  2008 Rand lobbies Pentagon start war to save US economy preferably with North
[10:10.300 --> 10:15.940]  Korea that's prisonplanet.com important flashback here's another one South
[10:15.940 --> 10:20.740]  Korea says it test fired in area before North Korea firing now first they said
[10:20.740 --> 10:25.460]  that wasn't true now they've come out and said yes we were in an area disputed
[10:25.460 --> 10:30.980]  doing a drills and you know let's be clear about North Korea in Kim Il-sung
[10:30.980 --> 10:37.220]  the psychopathic granddaddy his current leader his son Kim Jong-il and then Kim
[10:37.220 --> 10:41.740]  Jong-un the new general who's never been photographed a few months ago and he
[10:41.740 --> 10:45.860]  appears as the new leader and everyone starts everyone starts worshipping him
[10:45.860 --> 10:52.900]  and we lost 53,686 Americans in the Korean War and we lost a few
[10:52.900 --> 10:56.940]  thousand more fifty eight thousand two hundred nine and of course that's who
[10:56.940 --> 11:00.860]  immediately died in country a lot more than that died from the wounds that they
[11:00.860 --> 11:09.900]  sustained so this is a big deal what we know is about six hours ago so that's
[11:09.900 --> 11:20.380]  in the almost evening over there about six hours ago there was a drill on the
[11:20.380 --> 11:27.460]  western side of the Korean Peninsula right up by the sea lanes and in and sea
[11:27.460 --> 11:35.980]  border of North Korea and there was US and Korean aircraft helicopters ships in
[11:35.980 --> 11:41.860]  the area doing attack drills and that's not denied and firing artillery on
[11:41.860 --> 11:47.980]  simulated ships and it got too close for comfort and the North Koreans have
[11:47.980 --> 11:53.260]  seriously escalated things it's very very dangerous but the issue here is in
[11:53.260 --> 11:56.860]  fact I forgot to tell you guys this during the break I want to immediately
[11:56.860 --> 12:01.460]  call Webster Tarpley I want to immediately call Wayne Madsen they both
[12:01.460 --> 12:05.540]  are on par with each other with their caliber of research on this region see
[12:05.540 --> 12:09.620]  which one of them you can get on at 1230 an hour from now an hour and 15 minutes
[12:09.620 --> 12:14.820]  from now in between Ron Paul and Judge Andrew Napolitano coming on I want to
[12:14.820 --> 12:18.060]  get one of those guys on to get their early response to this but I remember
[12:18.060 --> 12:23.380]  Madsen was the first I saw early on going to James weapons quarterly and
[12:23.380 --> 12:28.780]  looking at the torpedo parts from that South Korean ship that got blown up that
[12:28.780 --> 12:34.260]  they blamed on North Korea and saying that's a German torpedo and then months
[12:34.260 --> 12:38.140]  later the Chinese government said it and then even mainstream news here kind of
[12:38.140 --> 12:42.580]  as a footnote said yeah looks like a German made torpedo now did the North
[12:42.580 --> 12:48.100]  Koreans buy German torpedoes in the black market or did we know that goes on
[12:48.100 --> 12:53.380]  through Russia and China or was this a third-party purchase and done by a
[12:53.380 --> 12:57.780]  private contractor or South Korean corporation or our own government I mean
[12:57.780 --> 13:02.300]  when you got a government that stage the Gulf of Tonkin operation Ajax
[13:02.300 --> 13:06.580]  operation Gladio and so many other provocations and that two years ago on
[13:06.580 --> 13:12.460]  888 snuck attack Russia look I'm no fan of Russia they're not perfect by any
[13:12.460 --> 13:16.140]  stretch of the imagination I'm no fan of communist China I'm no certainly no
[13:16.140 --> 13:19.340]  fan of North Korea I mean that's just tyrannical and out of control as it gets
[13:19.340 --> 13:25.300]  but you notice that all the big banks the big corporations neocon
[13:25.300 --> 13:29.100]  publications they're all on record saying if we have a big war bigger than
[13:29.100 --> 13:33.780]  Iraq that really sucks the American people in it'll be a great smoke screen
[13:33.780 --> 13:37.860]  for the open announcement of world government the carbon taxes the global
[13:37.860 --> 13:42.420]  VAT the new bank of the world people won't be angry anymore about losing part
[13:42.420 --> 13:47.820]  of their pension funds or all of this austerity it's a perfect way to unify
[13:47.820 --> 13:52.700]  everybody and also drive up the dollar you notice the dollar shot up today so
[13:52.700 --> 13:57.100]  did gold it's all seen as a safe haven because America still the big empire
[13:57.100 --> 14:01.340]  even though we're bankrupt by design we've got this supposed hardware and
[14:01.340 --> 14:05.500]  weapon systems and the biggest military more than half the world's defense
[14:05.500 --> 14:09.420]  budgets combined here in the United States about 54% last time I checked of
[14:09.420 --> 14:15.340]  total global defense spending is by this country we build the military and
[14:15.340 --> 14:19.860]  train the military finance the military to empower the globalist so then
[14:19.860 --> 14:23.900]  America gets the blame while the globalists get the brawn and and never
[14:23.900 --> 14:27.860]  get identified so so this is a way to get everybody to pour back into dollars
[14:27.860 --> 14:31.940]  to prop up the economy for the globalist as they continue to consolidate
[14:31.940 --> 14:37.540]  you got Europe going down the tubes you've got a quote fire sale of Irish
[14:37.540 --> 14:43.500]  banks going on right now so the IMF and World Bank get them in debt put
[14:43.500 --> 14:48.020]  politicians in power by financing them on record to get the nation in debt then
[14:48.020 --> 14:52.780]  the big IMF World Bank come in with European EU taxpayer money with US
[14:52.780 --> 14:56.980]  taxpayer money and quote shore up Ireland but if you read notice that's
[14:56.980 --> 15:00.100]  why they had to get them into Ireland so they be under that treaty last year
[15:00.100 --> 15:03.860]  they couldn't implode Ireland till they got them into that treaty as we
[15:03.860 --> 15:08.020]  predicted last year now that they've gotten them into the treaty this year
[15:08.020 --> 15:12.300]  now it's a complete fire sale they're cut there they're cutting their pension
[15:12.300 --> 15:16.500]  funds raising their taxes and taking over their domestic banks and blaming
[15:16.500 --> 15:20.660]  their domestic banks in the news for what happened in Ireland when the policy
[15:20.660 --> 15:26.260]  was set by the global central banks of the IMF World Bank and that is in the
[15:26.260 --> 15:33.380]  news today this is out of Yahoo Finance Reuters by Steve Slater Ireland
[15:33.380 --> 15:39.340]  hoist for sale sign over stricken banks Reuters Ireland banks are up for sale
[15:39.340 --> 15:42.740]  the country central bank chief said as the government seeks to cut them down
[15:42.740 --> 15:47.020]  in size after the reckless lending forced the country to seek an
[15:47.020 --> 15:51.460]  international bailout they are for sale as far as I'm concerned said Patrick
[15:51.460 --> 15:57.500]  Hoonhan said Thursday and it goes on I have been an advocate for a number of
[15:57.500 --> 16:01.500]  years for small countries to have foreign owners for their banks oh yeah
[16:01.500 --> 16:05.180]  that's freedom see the end of your sovereignty it's not some foreign
[16:05.180 --> 16:10.900]  government that dominates you it's the private central banks and that's Patrick
[16:10.900 --> 16:16.700]  Hoonhan Dublin has already said it will intensify reform of the banks reforms
[16:16.700 --> 16:20.140]  always see when the IMF World Bank takes over a third-world country reform is
[16:20.140 --> 16:23.620]  raising taxes cutting services and giving almost all your GDP to the
[16:23.620 --> 16:27.220]  private banks and then after they're done with Ireland it'll be Portugal and
[16:27.220 --> 16:37.900]  Spain and England and France and then Germany and then the United States and
[16:37.900 --> 16:42.140]  it's just all publicly done in plain view but the general public doesn't
[16:42.140 --> 16:45.820]  understand this they know about Natalie Holloway they know about O.J. Simpson
[16:45.820 --> 16:50.260]  they know about Dancing with the Stars they know that Sarah Palin's cute and
[16:50.260 --> 16:54.300]  they just get caught up in the mindlessness of it as the private
[16:54.300 --> 16:58.540]  central banks conquer our society now I want to play this Russia today clip with
[16:58.540 --> 17:02.260]  how concerned Russia is here in just a moment and also show you some of the
[17:02.260 --> 17:07.340]  video what's going on for prison planet TV viewers but that's why they would
[17:07.340 --> 17:10.660]  stage this we don't know that was staged but that's why the globalist would
[17:10.660 --> 17:14.740]  stage this with Korea right now as a political diversion and to get the world
[17:14.740 --> 17:19.340]  to run under the wings like baby chicks of the Anglo-American establishment
[17:19.340 --> 17:25.540]  scared of North Korea who we know Donald Rumsfeld the head of ABB transferred
[17:25.540 --> 17:30.060]  the nuclear reactors to in the mid-1990s and got bipartisan backing and
[17:30.060 --> 17:35.220]  authorization from William Jefferson Clinton unified continuity of agenda
[17:35.220 --> 17:41.420]  and treason here's the RT clip stay with us South Korea has admitted it fired
[17:41.420 --> 17:45.060]  artillery shells that triggered an early morning clash with North Korea
[17:45.060 --> 17:48.620]  however it says it was part of a military drill and denied it was
[17:48.620 --> 17:52.740]  directed at the North earlier Seoul blamed the North for what it called an
[17:52.740 --> 17:57.300]  unprovoked shelling of its island Pyongyang claimed the South had violated
[17:57.300 --> 18:01.620]  its maritime border during the military drills soldiers since threatened its
[18:01.620 --> 18:06.020]  neighbor with what it calls enormous retaliation Russian foreign ministry
[18:06.020 --> 18:09.940]  said the clash is what unacceptable and called on both sides to show restraint
[18:09.940 --> 18:17.060]  what happened deserves condemnation we insist that both sides must take
[18:17.060 --> 18:21.540]  measures to pacify the situation and prevent similar action in the future
[18:21.540 --> 18:26.540]  unfortunately this is already the third incident of the kind this year but this
[18:26.540 --> 18:30.460]  time there's a colossal danger of the situation descending into military
[18:30.460 --> 18:35.340]  conflict this must be avoided Russia has repeatedly warned of the growing
[18:35.340 --> 18:39.740]  tension in the region and is now counting on both sides to arrive at a
[18:39.740 --> 18:45.020]  suitable conclusion we'll have a little call from the Moscow State University
[18:45.020 --> 18:48.900]  told RT the international community is prejudiced against the North and is
[18:48.900 --> 18:54.460]  ready to blame it for everything with little evidence okay you can watch the
[18:54.460 --> 19:00.820]  rest of that up at RT.com and on YouTube but that's the Russian view air
[19:00.820 --> 19:06.380]  CNBC world edgy on Korea Russia sees colossal danger major powers expressed
[19:06.380 --> 19:11.060]  concern and alarm at North Korea's shelling of South Korean island today
[19:11.060 --> 19:17.100]  and it goes on among North Korea's neighbors Russia said it saw a colossal
[19:17.100 --> 19:21.860]  danger of an escalation in fighting on the Korean Peninsula and China said it
[19:21.860 --> 19:26.660]  was imperative to resume six-party talks aimed at ending the North's nuclear
[19:26.660 --> 19:34.580]  weapons program and it just continues just continues on from there we're gonna

[24:11.700 --> 24:20.540]  thank you for joining us on this Tuesday edition the 23rd day of November
[24:20.540 --> 24:31.700]  2010 this Korea's situation is so big it's so dangerous some would liken it to
[24:31.700 --> 24:35.620]  oh that's just like the Arabs and Israelis always killing each other
[24:35.620 --> 24:43.860]  this is different because both sides have giant mechanized militaries and they
[24:43.860 --> 24:53.140]  have only had a few skirmishes like this in the last 50 plus years and I was
[24:53.140 --> 24:56.700]  reading in the Associated Press they were going over the history of this this
[24:56.700 --> 25:04.780]  may be the biggest fracas or escalation in the entire history since the truce
[25:04.780 --> 25:12.260]  this is simply a ceasefire there's not been an armistice there's not been any
[25:12.260 --> 25:18.860]  formal agreement it is a ceasefire kind of like there was a ceasefire right
[25:18.860 --> 25:22.860]  before the Tet offensive in Vietnam that lasted just a few days well this one
[25:22.860 --> 25:30.020]  has lasted 50 plus years and many of my great uncles and family you know fought
[25:30.020 --> 25:35.260]  in Korea I know you've got a lot of family out there who who fought in
[25:35.260 --> 25:42.340]  Korea this is a very serious situation 56,000 Americans died in that short
[25:42.340 --> 25:49.140]  conflict very very serious situation the North are a bunch of brainwashed cult
[25:49.140 --> 25:54.660]  like drones who will and have proven they will march right into machine gun
[25:54.660 --> 26:01.140]  fire we were of course fighting China back during that event as well Chinese
[26:01.140 --> 26:09.340]  regulars China is of course supplying the South the North Korea to itself
[26:09.340 --> 26:15.180]  against South Korea and we're gonna get Ron Paul's take on this the TSA
[26:15.180 --> 26:21.460]  quantitative easing to and a lot more obviously later I'm gonna get into the
[26:21.460 --> 26:26.540]  TSA situation the drudge report drudge report comm has curtain memo story from
[26:26.540 --> 26:33.260]  info wars.com up there day number two going over the fact our trains and
[26:33.260 --> 26:36.020]  buses next when you read the article you find out trains and buses are
[26:36.020 --> 26:39.260]  already being searched now they're announcing they want mobile naked body
[26:39.260 --> 26:43.740]  scanners on the highways at the trains and bus terminals you know the pretext
[26:43.740 --> 26:49.500]  is anything that al-CIA al-Qaeda ever talks about hitting we've got to put
[26:49.500 --> 26:55.880]  federal minimum wage goons at now TSA workers are complaining I've been
[26:55.880 --> 27:00.620]  talking about this for two weeks the unsanitary nature of the blue gloves
[27:00.620 --> 27:05.260]  searching multiple people you could get crabs you could get diseases you could
[27:05.260 --> 27:13.260]  get flesh-eating bacteria you could get other forms of mites and I've also
[27:13.260 --> 27:16.700]  pointed out how this is abusive to the TSA workers well we're on that daily
[27:16.700 --> 27:23.980]  covered the unsanitary nature of the gloves today glad somebody covered it
[27:23.980 --> 27:30.300]  glad somebody took the cue to write stories about it so we've got that
[27:30.300 --> 27:35.420]  important issue the TSA workers are also saying that's the headline we hate
[27:35.420 --> 27:40.860]  obese passengers and people with personal hygiene issues now abuse TSA
[27:40.860 --> 27:45.540]  staff vent their anger at pat downs and they say we don't like sticking our
[27:45.540 --> 27:49.060]  hands down people's pants we don't like having to go up under people's fat roles
[27:49.060 --> 27:53.500]  we don't like having to mess with medical sutures since when does the
[27:53.500 --> 27:58.260]  government go into bandages and and probe them like a medical doctor since
[27:58.260 --> 28:07.340]  when do they remove colostomy bags and urology bags artificial bladders on the
[28:07.340 --> 28:10.460]  outside of people please don't touch that please don't pull on it
[28:10.460 --> 28:16.980]  oh sorry urine's pouring out TSA just says clean yourself up searching little
[28:16.980 --> 28:20.020]  five-year-olds in public pulling women's fake breast out who've had
[28:20.020 --> 28:25.540]  mastectomies sticking their hands down people's pants now that we force the
[28:25.540 --> 28:29.620]  sticking the hands down the pants into public debate the head of the TSA said
[28:29.620 --> 28:34.860]  that's wrong we're going to change that policy see that they tried to quietly set
[28:34.860 --> 28:38.460]  the precedent stick their hands down our pants and thought we just go along but
[28:38.460 --> 28:42.340]  by speaking out and saying no they're having to back out now now now now will
[28:42.340 --> 28:46.780]  they stage an event last week the German plane was a quote us firm testing
[28:46.780 --> 28:53.340]  security they won't say who that was a drill you got a drill to this North
[28:53.340 --> 29:00.140]  Korea situation triggering they always use a drill and they had drills going
[29:00.140 --> 29:02.940]  before they attacked the Russian control non-clays of south of the city in
[29:02.940 --> 29:07.420]  abkhazia two years ago trying to get war going drill drill drill drill drill
[29:07.420 --> 29:12.580]  drill drill drill drill they use drills because most people on the ships
[29:12.580 --> 29:16.740]  most people in the airports they're compartmentalized they don't know what's
[29:16.740 --> 29:22.260]  going on they don't understand what's happening they just go along with all
[29:22.260 --> 29:26.340]  of this but I've studied the globalist psychology I know how they operate I know
[29:26.340 --> 29:29.860]  what their game plan is we'll continue to break it down but that's coming up now
[29:29.860 --> 29:33.500]  the TSA are saying their victims and they're trying to unionize they have a
[29:33.500 --> 29:37.180]  union now in the last few months they just got one but they're trying to say
[29:37.180 --> 29:41.660]  no to all of this now some Republicans want private people searching us but I
[29:41.660 --> 29:44.940]  don't want private people sticking their hands down my pants either you know
[29:44.940 --> 29:48.460]  what I'd rather face the danger than live as a slave we'll be right back stay

[32:33.740 --> 33:03.420]  Schachter and see what he has to say we now take you live
[33:03.420 --> 33:08.460]  to the central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance you're
[33:08.460 --> 33:12.700]  listening to the Alex Jones show
[33:22.860 --> 33:26.660]  ladies and gentlemen I couldn't think of a better time to have congressman Ron
[33:26.660 --> 33:30.780]  Paul on with us he's only with us about 20 minutes I want to get into the Korea
[33:30.780 --> 33:35.540]  situation the TSA the quantitative easing to the monetization of debt I
[33:35.540 --> 33:40.260]  want to get into Rand Paul winning and then what that signifies the fact that
[33:40.260 --> 33:43.060]  Ron Paul and Rand Paul have announced that they're not going to be joining the
[33:43.060 --> 33:46.540]  Tea Party caucus because some of the leaders of it are people that voted for
[33:46.540 --> 33:50.180]  the bailout we're gonna be discussing all that congressman thank you for
[33:50.180 --> 33:54.060]  joining us good to be with you again of that constellation of things I threw out
[33:54.060 --> 33:56.900]  what do you think's most important right now
[33:56.900 --> 34:02.220]  well the cause of liberty that's always my number one goal and that is
[34:02.220 --> 34:05.980]  related to the deficit because the bigger the government the more good the
[34:05.980 --> 34:09.820]  government spends the less liberty we have and that involves what we do
[34:09.820 --> 34:14.140]  overseas as well as we do here so it's it's been the same old story and of
[34:14.140 --> 34:17.580]  course that's closely related to our financial system in our Federal Reserve
[34:17.580 --> 34:21.820]  because it would have been brought to a halt if they couldn't have been you know
[34:21.820 --> 34:25.580]  counterfeiting the money you know I'm seeing Wall Street Journal New York
[34:25.580 --> 34:31.620]  Times headlines every week now saying Ron Paul was right pointing out that
[34:31.620 --> 34:35.140]  everything you talked about in those debates and got laughed at but by a
[34:35.140 --> 34:41.660]  minority of fools has now come true what's your view on quantitative easing
[34:41.660 --> 34:45.540]  are you going to get the banking committee chairmanship where are you
[34:45.540 --> 34:50.700]  going in your interrogation of the Federal Reserve I'm assuming I'm going
[34:50.700 --> 34:54.780]  to get the chairmanship but you know until it's done you can't be absolutely
[34:54.780 --> 34:58.540]  positive but I'm working on the assumption that we will and I think most
[34:58.540 --> 35:03.140]  everybody will know where I stand on the Federal Reserve although my position is
[35:03.140 --> 35:07.620]  to abolish the Fed and I read a book called in the Fed I'm also I also take
[35:07.620 --> 35:13.500]  a stand that you know even if I could I wouldn't close the Federal Reserve in
[35:13.500 --> 35:16.700]  one day I think they're going to close itself when they have a runaway
[35:16.700 --> 35:20.940]  inflation that is droid of dollar and that's what's so dangerous but I was to
[35:20.940 --> 35:25.220]  argue the case for legalizing the Constitution and competition and
[35:25.220 --> 35:31.580]  allowing Golden Silver to be legal tender so everything they do is incorrect
[35:31.580 --> 35:34.980]  because they're managing the money supply and they're managing interest rates
[35:34.980 --> 35:38.620]  and that's where the source of the problem is and just recently some
[35:38.620 --> 35:41.900]  Republicans have come out and they say you know what we need to do is take away
[35:41.900 --> 35:45.980]  some of the responsibility of the Fed because they're supposed to be since
[35:45.980 --> 35:51.700]  1978 they were supposed to deal with unemployment which you know it's true
[35:51.700 --> 35:56.220]  that that was silly thing to do it and they give us our other ones who give us
[35:56.220 --> 36:01.100]  the unemployment they don't they can't produce employment but you know but
[36:01.100 --> 36:05.420]  removing that is almost irrelevant it's the fact that they exist and they
[36:05.420 --> 36:10.180]  manipulate interest rates and mess around with the supply and they're
[36:10.180 --> 36:14.780]  supposed to give us stable prices whether or not they have that additional
[36:14.780 --> 36:20.900]  mandate is missing the whole point it's almost a distraction absolutely I'm
[36:20.900 --> 36:26.420]  sure you noticed two weeks ago when the Chinese government said they want
[36:26.420 --> 36:31.260]  transparency on the Fed and basically called for an audit we now have foreign
[36:31.260 --> 36:35.900]  governments and the biggest owner of our debt calling for some transparency of
[36:35.900 --> 36:41.620]  this group yeah you know sometimes when our Congress wants to tell of the
[36:41.620 --> 36:45.300]  country has to do I object because we ought to mind our own business but you
[36:45.300 --> 36:49.020]  know if you've invested a trillion dollars or nearly a trillion dollars in
[36:49.020 --> 36:52.380]  our dollar they've almost earned the right to say something about our
[36:52.380 --> 36:56.500]  management of our dollar but the hypocrisy is for us to lecture China
[36:56.500 --> 37:00.860]  because we think their currency is too weak yet that's all we do is work on
[37:00.860 --> 37:08.740]  weakening our our currency so it's going to you know come to a boil I don't I
[37:08.740 --> 37:11.420]  don't think it's good I don't think it's good for the world I don't think it's
[37:11.420 --> 37:16.820]  good for us our economy and it's going to lead to a lot more trouble mainly
[37:16.820 --> 37:20.340]  because everybody has a fiat currency and everybody's trying to manage to
[37:20.340 --> 37:24.420]  maneuver somebody else and they just don't believe in sound money and they
[37:24.420 --> 37:28.780]  don't believe in in free markets congressman is this next session of
[37:28.780 --> 37:33.060]  Congress the new session starting next year with the Republican majority do
[37:33.060 --> 37:38.620]  you think in your gut this is the this is going to be the Congress working with
[37:38.620 --> 37:43.380]  your son in the Senate that is finally going to get a real audit of the second
[37:43.380 --> 37:48.460]  largest holder of our debt the private Federal Reserve I think it's going to
[37:48.460 --> 37:53.580]  still be an issue I think the auditing event will come up again there'll be
[37:53.580 --> 37:58.460]  some more votes we will get bits and pieces of information that we haven't
[37:58.460 --> 38:03.700]  had before but a real audit no I'm not expecting it but that doesn't diminish
[38:03.700 --> 38:09.260]  my desire to pursue the issue because you know even if we did finally get the
[38:09.260 --> 38:13.380]  votes in the Senate and came out in the bill a president would probably veto it
[38:13.380 --> 38:18.180]  and if he didn't veto it the Fed is going to stonewall us or they'll go to the
[38:18.180 --> 38:22.140]  court they'll get a favorable ruling on the courts that they don't have to do
[38:22.140 --> 38:27.460]  it so it would go on and on so it's more likely we're gonna find out about the
[38:27.460 --> 38:32.380]  Fed when when they self-destruct where they really just ruined the system and
[38:32.380 --> 38:36.700]  they no longer function to become irrelevant people will be forced to use
[38:36.700 --> 38:42.020]  some sound money that is a use of gold and silver coin I remember three years
[38:42.020 --> 38:47.180]  ago two years ago a year ago you basically with precision as a medical
[38:47.180 --> 38:51.340]  doctor as a congressman as someone who studies economics and it's one awards in
[38:51.340 --> 38:57.740]  that area that you that that as time went on you saw the the the self-destruction
[38:57.740 --> 39:03.820]  of this system through dollar devaluation coming obviously we're
[39:03.820 --> 39:09.500]  getting closer to that what type of timeframe do you see congressman but
[39:09.500 --> 39:13.700]  that's what you know not possible to predict and everybody wants to know
[39:13.700 --> 39:18.500]  investors need to know or they need to make estimates I work on the assumption
[39:18.500 --> 39:21.900]  that it could come anytime because there's no foundation to our system no
[39:21.900 --> 39:26.300]  foundation to our money no no support for the currency other than the promises
[39:26.300 --> 39:30.980]  of our politicians and the Federal Reserve and they're losing people are
[39:30.980 --> 39:35.500]  losing confidence in those entities constantly but I I think they tend to
[39:35.500 --> 39:40.220]  pull stuff out of the fire more than we ever dream they it doesn't deserve to
[39:40.220 --> 39:44.140]  exist and they've really messed it up and we have these tremendous deficits I
[39:44.140 --> 39:48.940]  still think they could keep this thing going you know three or maybe even five
[39:48.940 --> 39:53.780]  years but to say that okay it's going to be safe so if you see interest rates go
[39:53.780 --> 39:58.460]  up why don't you go back into buying long-term firm bonds because you know in
[39:58.460 --> 40:03.300]  10 or 15 years there'll be be no problem that you can have confidence in what
[40:03.300 --> 40:08.620]  they're doing I think it's way too early to expect that well is it accurate to
[40:08.620 --> 40:12.420]  say this is a debt black hole and we're seeing this now in Ireland not just in
[40:12.420 --> 40:17.380]  Greece and Portugal and Spain and that the bigger the bailouts the more it
[40:17.380 --> 40:22.020]  just accelerates you know the final implosion yeah and everything is based
[40:22.020 --> 40:27.420]  on the dollar you know we're in all this trouble yet they can't deal out these
[40:27.420 --> 40:32.340]  countries or states like California everybody gets bailed out but the base
[40:32.340 --> 40:37.380]  is is the dollar and the dollar is the reserve and we're still getting away
[40:37.380 --> 40:40.180]  with it we're still printing the money and they're taking as much as China
[40:40.180 --> 40:44.460]  complains they they still you know buy some of our treasury debt less than they
[40:44.460 --> 40:48.900]  used to but they have so much and they don't they don't want to crash it so but
[40:48.900 --> 40:53.180]  there's going to be a limit and the markets are more powerful than the
[40:53.180 --> 40:56.420]  governments in the central banks I keep thinking back because I watched it so
[40:56.420 --> 41:01.980]  closely in the 70s and in the 60s because they kept pretending that gold
[41:01.980 --> 41:07.260]  was as the dollar was as good as gold and it was at $35 an ounce but finally
[41:07.260 --> 41:11.700]  the market overwhelmed no matter how many lies they told people lost
[41:11.700 --> 41:15.900]  confidence in it and they had to quit the game because there wasn't people
[41:15.900 --> 41:19.980]  called them on it they wanted their gold so the buck stops eventually that's
[41:19.980 --> 41:25.420]  going to happen again so the buck stops with a buck now now racing through some
[41:25.420 --> 41:28.900]  of what's happening we see the dollar back up today because of this Korea
[41:28.900 --> 41:33.700]  situation obviously North Korea is a horrible hereditary dictatorship under
[41:33.700 --> 41:40.220]  Kim Jong-un Kim Jong-un his secretive son but but now North Korea admits and
[41:40.220 --> 41:46.580]  Reuters they were doing drills and firing artillery into a questionable
[41:46.580 --> 41:50.860]  area the North Korea claims now North Korea has bombarded an island in the
[41:50.860 --> 41:55.660]  south killing and maiming quite a few people the South Korean president says
[41:55.660 --> 41:58.820]  they're preparing to strike the north the north is talking about annihilating
[41:58.820 --> 42:03.100]  the south and then I have this ran corporation report ran lobbies Pentagon
[42:03.100 --> 42:08.180]  for start of war to save US economy I think back to NATO stirring stuff up
[42:08.180 --> 42:13.460]  with Russia on 888 I have the Obama advisor telling the Financial Times of
[42:13.460 --> 42:17.660]  London bottom line here is Americans don't believe in President Obama's
[42:17.660 --> 42:22.660]  leadership Robert Shapiro said he has to find some way between now and
[42:22.660 --> 42:26.740]  demonstrating that he is a leader who could command confidence in short of a
[42:26.740 --> 42:30.580]  new 9-11 or Oklahoma City I can't think of how he can do that we also have
[42:30.580 --> 42:35.740]  neocon leaders telling Obama to attack Iran or start a war so we see a lot of
[42:35.740 --> 42:40.820]  hype out there to start some type of war or stir one up to boost the dollar and
[42:40.820 --> 42:45.300]  and keep this Ponzi scheme going your geopolitical take on that Congressman
[42:45.300 --> 42:51.620]  yeah it really is frightening when you hear people in our administration or
[42:51.620 --> 42:55.620]  outside the administration literally advocating more as a way to get out of
[42:55.620 --> 43:00.940]  an economic crisis which is which is just insane talk and it you know the
[43:00.940 --> 43:05.380]  whole idea that we're on the verge of a serious attack by North Korea on South
[43:05.380 --> 43:11.180]  Korea or anybody else they seem to be a little cookie for even implying that but
[43:11.180 --> 43:15.980]  you wonder how they get motivated to do that because you know it's it's worse
[43:15.980 --> 43:19.780]  than a third-world nation you know they they have weapons that's all they have
[43:19.780 --> 43:24.100]  but they don't have any wealth they had keen to feed their people and they have
[43:24.100 --> 43:29.380]  no more ability to to take over South Korea than the man the moon I just
[43:29.380 --> 43:33.380]  wished we weren't over there and if it is a problem which it may well be let
[43:33.380 --> 43:37.700]  South Korea take care of it let China take care of it they're close by they
[43:37.700 --> 43:41.580]  probably don't want another war over there Japan has interest involved but
[43:41.580 --> 43:46.220]  we don't and we need to stay the devil out of there unless they're doing it
[43:46.220 --> 43:50.420]  deliberately and then sort of orchestrating this in order to have the
[43:50.420 --> 43:55.220]  military industrial complex you know benefit and the dollar temporarily
[43:55.220 --> 44:02.420]  benefit but but you know how could how could the borders over there be anything
[44:02.420 --> 44:06.980]  compared to the borders between Texas and Mexico I mean how many people died on
[44:06.980 --> 44:12.820]  our borders in the last year thousand 28,000 the last two and a half years total
[44:12.820 --> 44:17.300]  and that's kind of out of sight out of mind but you have a better chance doctors
[44:17.300 --> 44:22.100]  you know of dying from a bee sting than being killed by terrorists moving to the
[44:22.100 --> 44:27.780]  next subject this radio show a month ago launched the exposure of the TSA with
[44:27.780 --> 44:32.860]  the new enhanced pat down kind of like enhanced interrogation is torture this
[44:32.860 --> 44:36.540]  is molestation now they admit they're sticking their hands in people's pants
[44:36.540 --> 44:41.180]  pistol tried to deny it yesterday when he was on ABC but they reported that ABC
[44:41.180 --> 44:44.780]  reporters are having him stick their hands down their pants I have witnessed
[44:44.780 --> 44:51.180]  men touching babies crotches so this is now confirmed and I believe this is a
[44:51.180 --> 44:57.060]  catalyst for the eruption of the anger that the American people already have
[44:57.060 --> 45:01.580]  doesn't this violate the tent amendment what our minimum wage federal
[45:01.580 --> 45:07.140]  employees doing groping everybody I mean how did we go this far you know it's
[45:07.140 --> 45:11.100]  hard to figure out who would have ever believed this and the other day when I
[45:11.100 --> 45:14.620]  introduced my legislation to deal with this I think you know I worry about the
[45:14.620 --> 45:18.140]  foreign policy spending the Federal Reserve our debt the whole mess which are
[45:18.140 --> 45:24.980]  huge but this one at this one addresses something else this one is just such an
[45:24.980 --> 45:30.980]  affront so much out in the open and government being so bold as to mallets
[45:30.980 --> 45:36.580]  in public and say they're doing it for our interest if we tolerate this there's
[45:36.580 --> 45:40.220]  something wrong with us I mean something wrong with it it's almost like it's
[45:40.220 --> 45:44.060]  probably not fair to say this because so many people don't deserve it we deserve
[45:44.060 --> 45:49.100]  you know some of this stuff if we don't do something about it and hopefully the
[45:49.100 --> 45:53.340]  American people will do something they'll eventually have to boycott the
[45:53.340 --> 45:58.540]  airlines or whatever or throw the more the bums out maybe the Congress will get
[45:58.540 --> 46:03.260]  off their doff and do something in January and insist that we rein in the
[46:03.260 --> 46:08.740]  TSA congressman you know a month ago just with my own common sense I said this
[46:08.740 --> 46:13.020]  new enhanced pat down is meant to harass people into accepting the naked body
[46:13.020 --> 46:17.860]  scanners that shirt off and others are openly making money out of now Atlantic
[46:17.860 --> 46:22.780]  Monthly has talked to the TSA they admitted that yes we want to intimidate
[46:22.780 --> 46:28.340]  people so this is an act of harassment or sexual terrorism in my view and they
[46:28.340 --> 46:33.140]  admit it shouldn't there be congressional hearings about this I mean the
[46:33.140 --> 46:37.220]  you know the method to the madness if government can set the precedent to put
[46:37.220 --> 46:43.260]  its hands down your pants or remove a urology or colostomy bag and they are
[46:43.260 --> 46:48.540]  doing this that's confirmed or to strip down five-year-olds in full view it
[46:48.540 --> 46:53.580]  reminds me of the Nazis they started out with papers please and 33 by 40 it was
[46:53.580 --> 46:57.140]  stripping women down with babies and running them into pits and shooting them
[46:57.140 --> 47:00.500]  in the back of the head we have the film footage of that I mean I mean this is
[47:00.500 --> 47:06.060]  clearly to dominate us and to break our will but I think they've gone gone one
[47:06.060 --> 47:10.700]  step too far I think they've triggered the sleeping giant yeah I hope so it
[47:10.700 --> 47:15.420]  seems it seems that way showing our papers we've capitulated on that a long
[47:15.420 --> 47:19.260]  time because we show our social security number and our driver's license and
[47:19.260 --> 47:22.980]  whole work no matter what we do get a job or buy something they usually want
[47:22.980 --> 47:27.660]  those numbers but now they want to want the government to show show them our
[47:27.660 --> 47:32.340]  genitalia and they want to take pictures of us and put their hands into our
[47:32.340 --> 47:39.300]  pants and all that so that's hopefully enough to wake the people up and what I
[47:39.300 --> 47:42.860]  think is great you know we complain a lot about the mainstream media and they
[47:42.860 --> 47:46.700]  haven't been very friendly to us but there's been a lot of good pictures on
[47:46.700 --> 47:52.900]  all the TV stations you know because it's been so abusive so even though I say
[47:52.900 --> 47:59.300]  a fraction of the American people fly frequently the I'm sure them almost all
[47:59.300 --> 48:03.020]  Americans now have seen some of these pictures and saying to themselves hey
[48:03.020 --> 48:08.060]  what's going on here I mean why are they doing this so I think I think it's a
[48:08.060 --> 48:11.620]  healthy wake-up call to a lot of Americans I just hope they can work
[48:11.620 --> 48:15.580]  that in to the whole concept of what's been going on with our country for a
[48:15.580 --> 48:20.140]  long time government is too big and intrusive and abuse our rights and they
[48:20.140 --> 48:22.900]  do the things they shouldn't be doing and they forget about the things they
[48:22.900 --> 48:27.340]  were instructed to do congressman again I noticed three weeks ago that this
[48:27.340 --> 48:30.580]  could be the catalyst for the American people to finally stand up and realize
[48:30.580 --> 48:34.700]  the power we have now mainstream media is admitting that this is something
[48:34.700 --> 48:39.620]  almost like the Tea Party that you were the catalyst for back in 0708 I really
[48:39.620 --> 48:45.540]  see this trending towards a a a a changing point on the graph going back
[48:45.540 --> 48:50.060]  towards liberty do you agree yeah I think so and they'll always be trying to
[48:50.060 --> 48:54.220]  minimize it and dilute it so maybe they'll see this as opportunity they
[48:54.220 --> 48:59.260]  have to back off and they might contract some of this work on and but but they
[48:59.260 --> 49:03.020]  contracted out to their favorite corporations and they're doing the same
[49:03.020 --> 49:08.140]  thing we have to be careful that they're not exempt you know from the same
[49:08.140 --> 49:12.100]  abuse that we're complaining about that was my next question have you ever
[49:12.100 --> 49:16.260]  suffered at the hands of the TSA I I have to go through that all the time
[49:16.260 --> 49:22.060]  because I have metal in my knees and and I don't go through well but basically
[49:22.060 --> 49:27.420]  there's the the x-rays not available and I hate the idea of doing that so I get
[49:27.420 --> 49:30.940]  prodded all the time and it's disgusting and I tell them so I think this is
[49:30.940 --> 49:35.540]  disgusting how can you do it and why am I talking about what it is it's so
[49:35.540 --> 49:42.460]  disgusting that that that it that I just don't understand and that's why I am
[49:42.460 --> 49:46.060]  determined to do my very best to wake up the people about what's happening well
[49:46.060 --> 49:49.780]  doctor we've only had about two minutes left a medical doctor as permission is
[49:49.780 --> 49:53.860]  trained does it respectfully when you go get an exam you know you're a guy an
[49:53.860 --> 49:58.740]  ecologist and delivered so many babies but now some minimum-wage person is
[49:58.740 --> 50:04.460]  pulling off urology bags is sticking their hands in people's pants Jesse
[50:04.460 --> 50:08.260]  Ventura the former governor said here last Friday that he's gonna boycott it
[50:08.260 --> 50:12.980]  and and he believes enough people don't fly that will force industry to put
[50:12.980 --> 50:17.740]  pressure on government I mean specifically have you had them have you
[50:17.740 --> 50:21.300]  had the enhanced pat down yet sir have they touched your crotch absolutely and
[50:21.300 --> 50:26.140]  it's like I said absolutely disgusting and you know they've already proven the
[50:26.140 --> 50:29.900]  point you know if it but my argument is that the airlines the owners of the
[50:29.900 --> 50:34.020]  airlines are responsible which should be continental and United other people and
[50:34.020 --> 50:37.420]  we should decide whether we want to contract with them on what kind of
[50:37.420 --> 50:43.980]  rules they want to set but this idea that the government can do it and
[50:43.980 --> 50:49.060]  forces to do it you know it's absolutely ridiculous I do think that a boycott is
[50:49.060 --> 50:52.300]  necessary it's gonna be really tough I mean just that for instance how am I
[50:52.300 --> 50:57.780]  gonna get back and forth to DC you know but there's there's a lot of a lot of
[50:57.780 --> 51:01.980]  alternatives for a lot of other people quit flying if I have to go 500 miles
[51:01.980 --> 51:06.700]  I'm driving I'm not gonna I'm not gonna get on that airplane I really have to
[51:06.700 --> 51:11.140]  but I'm gonna be I'm gonna be my I'm gonna be doing everything conceivable to
[51:11.140 --> 51:15.780]  try to you know change these rules because they aren't making us safer
[51:15.780 --> 51:19.900]  they're not better for is it just to enhance the power to stay intimidated
[51:19.900 --> 51:25.460]  and it will stop if the American people wake up so you're supporting you are
[51:25.460 --> 51:29.460]  supporting folks that are boycotting when they can yeah yeah I sit down on the
[51:29.460 --> 51:37.260]  house floor that that's a good idea even though I you know it might not solve
[51:37.260 --> 51:41.220]  it but it's gonna handicap it's gonna mess people out but that's what civil
[51:41.220 --> 51:44.980]  disobedience is all about because I don't want to go the next step and use
[51:44.980 --> 51:50.100]  violence and we should stand up and say I'm not enough well liberty is rising in
[51:50.100 --> 51:54.220]  the face of tyranny last question in 60 seconds what does the victory of Rand
[51:54.220 --> 51:59.340]  Paul to the US Senate mean in the face of the mainstream media's full demon
[51:59.340 --> 52:03.540] ization full lies they pulled out the stops at a level they've never even
[52:03.540 --> 52:08.380]  done to you in in my opinion and he still won when Clinton came in campaigned
[52:08.380 --> 52:13.220]  against him his numbers went up what does this mean that they failed in their
[52:13.220 --> 52:17.820]  demonization does that signify the shift from the dominant old-line media now
[52:17.820 --> 52:21.660]  being the dinosaur media I think so I think it means that liberties alive and
[52:21.660 --> 52:26.460]  well and even though we get down on a few occasions when things get bad but
[52:26.460 --> 52:31.820]  the number of people that are on our side now are very very large and that to
[52:31.820 --> 52:35.900]  me is very encouraging but we still have a lot of work to do to make sure that
[52:35.900 --> 52:39.140]  those who are going to Washington know exactly what they're supposed to be
[52:39.140 --> 52:43.660]  doing and that they stick to their guns is Carol proud she is she's very pleased
[52:43.660 --> 52:48.100]  and we'll see Rand here at Christmastime and you're gonna be working with him
[52:48.100 --> 52:53.580]  now coming up yeah we talk amazing a great senator and a great House member
[52:53.580 --> 52:57.420]  congressman have a great Thanksgiving God bless you all right there he goes
[52:57.420 --> 53:00.620]  ladies and gentlemen congressman Ron Paul we went a few minutes into that
[53:00.620 --> 53:07.140]  network break so we can continue well that's breaking news Ron Paul has been
[53:07.140 --> 53:13.300]  grown by the TSA you know I'm really glad that I brought that question up to
[53:13.300 --> 53:20.660]  him and then he is supporting Governor Ventura in his actions very very
[53:20.660 --> 53:26.460]  powerful information on that front with Congressman Ron Paul and other breaking
[53:26.460 --> 53:30.260]  news you heard Ron Paul saying that there is a possibility this could be a
[53:30.260 --> 53:35.380]  staged provocation by the military industrial complex with the lunatics
[53:35.380 --> 53:43.140]  prodding the lunatic asylum that is North Korea to prop up the dollar he
[53:43.140 --> 53:46.860]  agreed with my analysis that that has to be looked at my gut tells me that our
[53:46.860 --> 53:51.660]  real resident expert Wayne Madsen who's always got the Washington sources I
[53:51.660 --> 53:55.220]  know he's been on the phone all morning formally worked with the Navy in
[53:55.220 --> 54:00.100]  submarine warfare then for the NSA he's gonna be joining us a real expert on the
[54:00.100 --> 54:06.100]  situation with North Korea and Kim Jong-il and his demonic son Kim Jong-un
[54:06.100 --> 54:13.220]  so that is coming up in about 35 minutes you want to be technical about 37
[54:13.220 --> 54:17.700]  minutes from now he will be on with us we have Judge Andrew Napolitano popping
[54:17.700 --> 54:22.420]  in on the TSA on the economy on the police state on the huge awakening that's
[54:22.420 --> 54:28.500]  happening at the start of the third hour as well on this live Tuesday
[54:28.500 --> 54:34.940]  transmission ahead of the busiest day in travel is that they report the
[54:34.940 --> 54:40.860]  Wednesday and Friday before and after Thanksgiving so we'll be here live
[54:40.860 --> 54:46.740]  tomorrow tracking exactly what's going on with the TSA lines TSA has a free app
[54:46.740 --> 54:49.580]  but you don't know they're giving you real info but they are reporting on the
[54:49.580 --> 54:56.700]  app and in the news record long lines in LA Chicago JFK New York and other
[54:56.700 --> 55:01.740]  areas and that's fine bring it all to a halt bring airline travel to a halt make
[55:01.740 --> 55:05.700]  the airlines lose money make the hotels lose money because the feds want to
[55:05.700 --> 55:12.340]  slowly strangle industry and commerce and tourism we want to have it all come
[55:12.340 --> 55:17.100]  at once kind of like a fever to shake off this bug this disease of big
[55:17.100 --> 55:21.340]  government over transportation instead of a slow death we want to have a big
[55:21.340 --> 55:26.220]  fever bring it all do ahead lance the boil it'll be ugly at first but you're
[55:26.220 --> 55:29.260]  already losing according to the federal government's own admissions nine
[55:29.260 --> 55:34.980]  billion dollars a year every year 2006 789 into this year and they're estimating
[55:34.980 --> 55:41.020]  over 40 billion to be lost this year over a third of the foreigners that would
[55:41.020 --> 55:44.020]  come here for vacation from Western Europe and other areas tourism down by
[55:44.020 --> 55:46.700]  third overall that's just the base number you can pull those numbers up you
[55:46.700 --> 55:51.220]  can just search the term tourism down by over a third this is killing us you got
[55:51.220 --> 55:55.180]  a better chance of dying from a bee sting government admits that I mean do we
[55:55.180 --> 55:59.900]  have checkpoints in every field in case a bee flies out to a school and sits on
[55:59.900 --> 56:05.220]  a on some steps and you sit on them I mean how many times the child playing in
[56:05.220 --> 56:09.220]  the woods or playing on the backyard did I sit down on a bench and have a bee
[56:09.220 --> 56:13.780]  sting me I mean we used to fight with ping-pong paddles for entertainment we
[56:13.780 --> 56:18.340]  run up with water guns and spray bushes and eaves of houses that had yellow
[56:18.340 --> 56:23.380]  jacket and wasness and have them chase us talk about excitement and I got stung
[56:23.380 --> 56:28.460]  a lot come home mom put hydrogen peroxide on it of course I know why
[56:28.460 --> 56:32.340]  folks are scared of bees I always thought it was no big deal till I was I
[56:32.340 --> 56:38.060]  guess 20 years old working on a garden in the backyard and there were some
[56:38.060 --> 56:41.020]  Africanized bees and I probably got stung 30 40 times I don't know I had all
[56:41.020 --> 56:44.260]  these stingers in my head and I swole up bright red got in the shower poor
[56:44.260 --> 56:48.340]  begging so it on myself couldn't breathe was about to call 911 and it kind of
[56:48.340 --> 56:52.700]  reversed itself so I understand kids you shouldn't have wars with bees and yellow
[56:52.700 --> 56:59.900]  jackets the point is that you know the issue here is you got a much bigger
[56:59.900 --> 57:04.300]  danger are we gonna have a federal bureaucracy every 10 feet with guys in
[57:04.300 --> 57:09.140]  hazmat suits and you know like little laser guns to you know that hone in and
[57:09.140 --> 57:13.420]  kill all bees and have like troop carriers landing everywhere and
[57:13.420 --> 57:17.580]  invading countries we've got bees in Germany we got bees in Russia invade you
[57:17.580 --> 57:24.780]  know giant troop carriers landing troops running off get the bees if they
[57:24.780 --> 57:30.060]  kill one American we got to get rid of all bees you know it's it's I mean many
[57:30.060 --> 57:36.180]  put little turbines on the bees in like posters and TV ads this is al-qaeda they
[57:36.180 --> 57:40.140]  killed hundreds of people last year in the US alone they're deadly you never
[57:40.140 --> 57:43.660]  know where they're hiding they're in every town every city they may be in
[57:43.660 --> 57:50.820]  your backyard honey bees other al-qaeda operatives red wasp even hornets known
[57:50.820 --> 57:56.020]  as the Osama bin Laden Hornet they're green and yellow and can kill deadly black
[57:56.020 --> 58:01.980]  wasp deadly brown wasp burrowing wood wasp red ants fire ants pull up the
[58:01.980 --> 58:07.180]  numbers in fact for me numbers of deaths a year be a fire ant numbers of deaths
[58:07.180 --> 58:12.180]  per year bee stings I know it's in the hundred and I mean literally we need to
[58:12.180 --> 58:31.300]  TV ads fear it they're everywhere they're killing hundreds oh my gosh oh my gosh it's so ridiculous but they don't teach you to fear the bees they teach it
[58:31.300 --> 58:51.820]  thank you for listening to GCN visit GCN live com today this is Alex Jones with
[58:51.820 --> 58:55.580]  five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator number
[58:55.580 --> 58:59.340]  one new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill
[58:59.340 --> 59:03.860]  number two our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric
[59:03.860 --> 59:08.060]  company allows you to have it's true total government control of electricity
[59:08.060 --> 59:12.700]  in the name of smart grid technology is coming number three in some areas of the
[59:12.700 --> 59:16.700]  country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist
[59:16.700 --> 59:20.820]  legislation is only compounding the problem number four dangerous weather
[59:20.820 --> 59:24.780]  is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of families lose their
[59:24.780 --> 59:28.940]  power from weather related onages number five a solar power generator provides
[59:28.940 --> 59:32.740]  powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks I really believe in the solar
[59:32.740 --> 59:36.660]  power generators offered by solution from science one of my oldest sponsors you
[59:36.660 --> 59:42.220]  can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com that's mysolarbackup.com
[59:42.220 --> 59:46.980]  remember the government doesn't own the Sun so go to mysolarbackup.com or call

[01:00:43.540 --> 01:00:48.140]  deal I want to get your take on the North Korean situation I want to recap
[01:00:48.140 --> 01:00:54.940]  that right now I want to take calls specifically only on the North Korea
[01:00:54.940 --> 01:01:00.060]  situation I want to talk about that I want to get your view on what's
[01:01:00.060 --> 01:01:03.620]  happening and then recap those developments the toll-free number to

[01:01:15.700 --> 01:01:24.260]  the Genesis phone system now if you just joined us technically this happened when
[01:01:24.260 --> 01:01:28.340]  it was still midnight in some time zones of the United States or before midnight
[01:01:28.340 --> 01:01:34.060]  so it happened on Monday night here but but it happened on Tuesday over in Asia
[01:01:34.060 --> 01:01:38.180]  because they're you know the day starts over there in Australia basically if you
[01:01:38.180 --> 01:01:48.020]  look at the time zones or it's the next day it actually starts against Greenish
[01:01:48.020 --> 01:01:51.940]  meantime the point is it happened on Tuesday over there Monday over here that
[01:01:51.940 --> 01:01:57.020]  minutia doesn't matter getting into it here breaking South Korea threatened
[01:01:57.020 --> 01:02:02.180]  retaliation against North don't forget Rand Lobby's Pentagon start war to save
[01:02:02.180 --> 01:02:07.260]  US economy South Korea says its test fired in the area before North Korea
[01:02:07.260 --> 01:02:14.180]  there's evidence that that missile that was fired of course a few weeks ago was
[01:02:14.180 --> 01:02:20.300]  China all sorts of bizarre stuff going on hours and hours of exchange from fire
[01:02:20.300 --> 01:02:24.100]  with the North firing into an island of South Korean island killing at least two
[01:02:24.100 --> 01:02:29.140]  Marines and injuring a whole bunch of other people the skirmish began when
[01:02:29.140 --> 01:02:32.500]  North Korea warned the South to halt military drills in the area according
[01:02:32.500 --> 01:02:36.100]  to South Korean officials when Seol refused to begin firing artillery in a
[01:02:36.100 --> 01:02:40.500]  disputed waters albeit away from North Korean shore the North retaliated by
[01:02:40.500 --> 01:02:44.060]  bombarding the small island which houses South Korean military installations
[01:02:44.060 --> 01:02:48.860]  and small civilian population North Korea has threatened if anything else
[01:02:48.860 --> 01:02:54.260]  happens an all-out attack on Seol which is just within artillery range of the
[01:02:54.260 --> 01:03:00.860]  North and the DMZ the demilitarized zone the North promised a deadly
[01:03:00.860 --> 01:03:05.860]  counter strike if anything happens the Russians are calling this a colossal
[01:03:05.860 --> 01:03:10.020]  danger I tend to agree this could trigger a major regional conflict I agree with
[01:03:10.020 --> 01:03:13.500]  Ron Paul the congressman we should completely stay out of this and say
[01:03:13.500 --> 01:03:20.580]  hey Japan South Korea China you guys all just you know you get into it with
[01:03:20.580 --> 01:03:26.700]  each other we have already lost 56,000 Americans over there in that war we have
[01:03:26.700 --> 01:03:31.900]  already had conflict ongoing we do not need to be part of this but I made the
[01:03:31.900 --> 01:03:36.340]  point to Ron Paul you notice the dollar shot back up today you notice the Rand
[01:03:36.340 --> 01:03:41.620]  Corporation and neocons have been in the news telling Obama have a war with Iran
[01:03:41.620 --> 01:03:45.580]  have a war with others this will boost you he's got his advisors telling him
[01:03:45.580 --> 01:03:50.180]  that that's on record and and I think where there's smoke there's fire there's
[01:03:50.180 --> 01:03:53.940]  a good chance this was staged we don't know but they may have been firing that
[01:03:53.940 --> 01:03:56.860]  artillery you know right into the shoreline they were very close and they
[01:03:56.860 --> 01:04:02.020]  admit that and the North are complete lunatics very dangerous their puppets of
[01:04:02.020 --> 01:04:08.380]  China and you've got a lot of jockeying going on China uses North Korea as a
[01:04:08.380 --> 01:04:15.500]  proxy the West the United States and others use South as a proxy Japan uses
[01:04:15.500 --> 01:04:18.860]  them as a proxy though the Koreans and the Japanese hate each other as well
[01:04:18.860 --> 01:04:24.780]  because the past Japanese abuses so it's just an ongoing crisis and right now
[01:04:24.780 --> 01:04:31.780]  today tomorrow the next week anytime if any US ships or South Korean ships get
[01:04:31.780 --> 01:04:36.100]  near North Korea they're gonna start attacking again and this could escalate
[01:04:36.100 --> 01:04:40.740]  into a very serious situation very quickly and it's the perfect distraction
[01:04:40.740 --> 01:04:44.260]  as the open-world government's being announced as Europe swing being swallowed
[01:04:44.260 --> 01:04:49.100]  up by the global banks as Ireland's being swallowed up as domestically all
[01:04:49.100 --> 01:04:53.580]  these things happen the whole globalist agendas in trouble they need a war as a
[01:04:53.580 --> 01:04:58.500]  distraction every time there's global meltdowns they start a war we're online
[01:04:58.500 --> 01:05:03.380]  for one we've been predicting one this could be it hundreds of nations have
[01:05:03.380 --> 01:05:08.100]  fallen to tyranny in the last century alone this is our last chance to not
[01:05:08.100 --> 01:05:12.620]  relive history as we're finishing off this agenda that we're pulling the rug
[01:05:12.620 --> 01:05:16.900]  from underneath the Americans at home I've turned menace influence on our
[01:05:16.900 --> 01:05:21.100]  president in Congress and they really are calling the shots I think it's
[01:05:21.100 --> 01:05:26.340]  incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention for the
[01:05:26.340 --> 01:05:30.940]  Republic identifies the enemies of our nation the criminal offshore cartel
[01:05:30.940 --> 01:05:35.300]  held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world
[01:05:35.300 --> 01:05:39.020]  government Tim Geithner Bernanke their arsonists they're asking for more
[01:05:39.020 --> 01:05:42.980]  matches and the Congress is saying who do we make the checkout to today seems
[01:05:42.980 --> 01:05:48.540]  like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of
[01:05:48.540 --> 01:05:54.220]  the Republic yet your copy of fall of the Republic on DVD at info wars.com
[01:05:54.220 --> 01:06:01.540]  we're watching online right now in super high quality at prisonplanet.tv

[01:09:48.740 --> 01:09:53.420]  provocations that doesn't mean that the lunatics in North Korea are good that
[01:09:53.420 --> 01:09:58.620]  doesn't mean that they're not dangerous that doesn't mean that they might have
[01:09:58.620 --> 01:10:03.020]  done this but the point is they sent in ships South Korea with the US fired into

[01:10:31.940 --> 01:10:35.460]  something don't think they won't start a new war in Korea and try to ship our
[01:10:35.460 --> 01:10:39.220]  boys off over there to die you know 56,000 again like they did back in the
[01:10:39.220 --> 01:10:47.020]  late 50s in the Korean War we need to say no to this situation and we need to
[01:10:47.020 --> 01:10:53.460]  say no to this now as Ron Paul said earlier now here are these reports from
[01:10:53.460 --> 01:10:57.780]  prisonplanet.com they're also going up on info wars.com we need to get this out

[01:11:10.180 --> 01:11:16.500]  North Korea attack part of Rand plan for total war we're not talking about
[01:11:16.500 --> 01:11:21.580]  Rand Paul boys and girls now we need the new headline up there a blurb you know
[01:11:21.580 --> 01:11:27.580]  Congressman Ron Paul or Ron Paul says you know Ron Paul hopes military
[01:11:27.580 --> 01:11:33.860]  industrial complex not involved in Korea said you know or it's got to be a
[01:11:33.860 --> 01:11:39.180]  simple headline like Ron Paul concerned Ron Paul has suspicions Ron Paul I
[01:11:39.180 --> 01:11:41.860]  need to hear the exact audio because I was interviewing him last hour but I
[01:11:41.860 --> 01:11:50.300]  remembered exactly Ron Paul concerned military industrial complex hyping war
[01:11:50.300 --> 01:11:54.580]  with North Korea or or staging provocations for war North Korea to
[01:11:54.580 --> 01:11:58.860]  boost dollar that's basically what he said I mean this is big but North Korea
[01:11:58.860 --> 01:12:06.460]  attack part of Rand plan for total war key info we'll be talking about that
[01:12:06.460 --> 01:12:12.780]  coming up very soon here is an October 31st article on the Washington post the
[01:12:12.780 --> 01:12:23.300]  war recovery and it's the Washington Post saying that Barack Obama might need
[01:12:23.300 --> 01:12:27.300]  to stage a war to get their agenda going that's the Washington post so I'm
[01:12:27.300 --> 01:12:30.180]  telling you that's why Ron Paul responded and said yeah it's incredible
[01:12:30.180 --> 01:12:34.460]  that governments do talk about this this is very real what we're dealing with
[01:12:34.460 --> 01:12:38.780]  here Ron Paul another big newsmaker said he believes the Federal Reserve will
[01:12:38.780 --> 01:12:45.860]  implode and fall apart in a depression before it ever gets audited wow I mean
[01:12:45.860 --> 01:12:50.340]  what a bombshell interview ladies and gentlemen so we need to get Paul Watson
[01:12:50.340 --> 01:12:56.860]  Steve Watson Aaron's on assignment in another state right now I'm doing an
[01:12:56.860 --> 01:13:00.340]  interview we get our riders to get that together and decide who's gonna write
[01:13:00.340 --> 01:13:03.820]  what and get on it because this is big Mike in Wisconsin what's your take on the
[01:13:03.820 --> 01:13:10.900]  Korea situation oh it's a very scary time you got to remember one thing that a
[01:13:10.900 --> 01:13:15.300]  lot of these politicians we they have under and you can go on the internet on
[01:13:15.300 --> 01:13:19.660]  YouTube they have an underground basis where the politicians take their
[01:13:19.660 --> 01:13:25.500]  families under during times of war and the whole government installation goes
[01:13:25.500 --> 01:13:31.340]  underground and we're stuck up here that deal yeah that's COG that's COG
[01:13:31.340 --> 01:13:37.140]  continuity government absolutely it is very scary and and I think they what
[01:13:37.140 --> 01:13:41.860]  they want to do is depopulate the planet I think they've been told from outside
[01:13:41.860 --> 01:13:47.060]  this planet I'm not gonna get any aliens or nothing but they're told we need to
[01:13:47.060 --> 01:13:53.220]  depopulate and they know depopulation stimulates the economy too you know you
[01:13:53.220 --> 01:13:58.340]  you have less mouths to feed you know you have higher demands you have more
[01:13:58.340 --> 01:14:02.900]  mouths to feed you do have higher demands but you can't handle it all right
[01:14:02.900 --> 01:14:07.900]  I appreciate your call Mike it is true that when they had the black plague that
[01:14:07.900 --> 01:14:12.140]  wiped out 20 to 40% of different areas of Europe they're not sure because records
[01:14:12.140 --> 01:14:19.020]  weren't properly kept they know with the fleas on the rats and the cats carrying
[01:14:19.020 --> 01:14:24.860]  the bubonic plague the black plague that whole areas were wiped out and the
[01:14:24.860 --> 01:14:28.900]  Renaissance then came out of that but that was only because much of the ruling
[01:14:28.900 --> 01:14:34.980]  elite was wiped out if you actually study it and so it it knocked out some
[01:14:34.980 --> 01:14:39.140]  of the existing power structures and stagnation let's go it's kind of like
[01:14:39.140 --> 01:14:42.900]  burning down a forest then creates all that new nitrogen in the soil so it
[01:14:42.900 --> 01:14:47.180]  comes back even more green let's go ahead and talk to Bob in Arizona Bob
[01:14:47.180 --> 01:14:50.620]  you're on the air God bless you Alex thank you very much for having me on
[01:14:50.620 --> 01:14:56.140]  your show I'm I was in the merchant Marines Naval Reserve and this was
[01:14:56.140 --> 01:14:59.380]  something I wasn't even aware of there's a deal when people when you talk of the
[01:14:59.380 --> 01:15:04.300]  DMZ most people think of the North and South Korean demilitarized zone well we
[01:15:04.300 --> 01:15:09.540]  have a DMZ in North and South or North Korea and South Korea and we've got
[01:15:09.540 --> 01:15:15.460]  over 50,000 troops there since 1957 and basically what that what I want to say
[01:15:15.460 --> 01:15:21.940]  and tie everything together is the fact that you know pun intended but you've
[01:15:21.940 --> 01:15:29.460]  caught the the globalists with their pants down you know with with this TSA
[01:15:29.460 --> 01:15:36.020]  situation you you've got so many of your moles and you've got so many people
[01:15:36.020 --> 01:15:42.060]  that are working for you to give you high-powered information on the globalists
[01:15:42.060 --> 01:15:49.100]  that you're all over them like bees on honey and I truly believe that they need
[01:15:49.100 --> 01:15:55.900]  because this TSA situation like you've said they took it one step too far by
[01:15:55.900 --> 01:16:01.980]  grabbing people's privates they had to they have to do something extreme
[01:16:01.980 --> 01:16:05.620]  right now they have to teach us that there are saviors but not just because
[01:16:05.620 --> 01:16:09.580]  of the great grass roots taking action and saying no on the TSA of this being
[01:16:09.580 --> 01:16:13.740]  a catalyst for for for all of this anger to boil over and it's all of us
[01:16:13.740 --> 01:16:19.900]  together it's also that they're openly taking over Ireland getting ready to
[01:16:19.900 --> 01:16:23.860]  take over Portugal and Spain they've taken over Greece they're cutting
[01:16:23.860 --> 01:16:29.780]  people's benefits raising their taxes they need a political smokescreen
[01:16:29.780 --> 01:16:35.580]  globally to prop up the dollar so that all other currencies drop first so the
[01:16:35.580 --> 01:16:40.500]  dollar is the last currency standing before they convert to the global SDR
[01:16:40.500 --> 01:16:46.300]  so a war is good for them on their entire agenda and that's why they're
[01:16:46.300 --> 01:16:49.660]  trying to start a war two years ago with Russia trying to start one now with
[01:16:49.660 --> 01:16:53.300]  North Korea doesn't mean Russia's perfect we certainly know North Korea's
[01:16:53.300 --> 01:16:58.260]  bad news but the globalists are there trying to stage this now and I hear you
[01:16:58.260 --> 01:17:03.180]  good to hear from you I appreciate your call John who's up next year
[01:17:03.180 --> 01:17:09.780]  Nate in California you're on the air go ahead good sir yeah so I think the
[01:17:09.780 --> 01:17:14.780]  North and South Korea thing is all China just like the submarines over here
[01:17:14.780 --> 01:17:19.300]  when Obama's overseas they flex in his muscle they come over here and say and
[01:17:19.300 --> 01:17:23.620]  look what we can do so I think it's pretty much all China because like you
[01:17:23.620 --> 01:17:29.620]  said they control China or they control North Korea right China yes yeah so I
[01:17:29.620 --> 01:17:33.820]  think they're probably just pushing the strings for them but um isn't it true
[01:17:33.820 --> 01:17:38.020]  that the Rothschilds and central banks are only a few countries that they don't
[01:17:38.020 --> 01:17:43.660]  have their fingers in like Iran and like these countries yes any country under
[01:17:43.660 --> 01:17:50.380]  attack like Libya Iran so-called rogue nations whether they're good nations
[01:17:50.380 --> 01:17:54.180]  or bad nations and most nations are run by crooks so they're bad the point is
[01:17:54.180 --> 01:17:57.660]  they're not the globalist any country the globalists are trying to take over
[01:17:57.660 --> 01:18:02.180]  or overthrow is a nation that didn't take a private central bank that didn't
[01:18:02.180 --> 01:18:06.420]  follow the globalist eugenics program China has done everything the New World
[01:18:06.420 --> 01:18:11.820]  Order wants so China is the apple of their eye China's been given the Panama
[01:18:11.820 --> 01:18:16.100]  Canal they've been given favorable trade deals to deindustrialize the US and
[01:18:16.100 --> 01:18:19.500]  yes a lot of evidence and even the military thinks that was a Chinese
[01:18:19.500 --> 01:18:25.660]  missile as a threat to the US launch from a sub basically a copy of a Polaris
[01:18:25.660 --> 01:18:32.460]  submarine launched from beneath the water and it's the same situation now
[01:18:32.460 --> 01:18:37.220]  with the proxy wars between South and North Korea you've got US and Korean
[01:18:37.220 --> 01:18:41.340]  vessels right up in the edge of the North Korean waters firing artillery
[01:18:41.340 --> 01:18:47.680]  right into their waters and North Korea wouldn't have the bravada or the
[01:18:47.680 --> 01:18:53.320]  hubris to start blasting South Korean military bases and I mean really
[01:18:53.320 --> 01:18:57.740]  lighten them up if China wasn't backing them just like they did back in the
[01:18:57.740 --> 01:19:04.540]  Korean War right yeah so it just seems yeah maybe with the TSA and China and
[01:19:04.540 --> 01:19:08.860]  everything is just smoke screens to get everybody worried about all this and
[01:19:08.860 --> 01:19:13.060]  while they're oh yeah China I mean listen this stuff is so agreed upon at
[01:19:13.060 --> 01:19:18.060]  certain levels they may have already made a deal and then China ordered North
[01:19:18.060 --> 01:19:22.100]  Korea you know basically to respond and I mean I mean at that level our
[01:19:22.100 --> 01:19:25.700]  governments are like tied at the hip via the corporate connections and this
[01:19:25.700 --> 01:19:29.780]  could be completely staged as a way to prop the dollar up and you heard Ron Paul
[01:19:29.780 --> 01:19:32.980]  last hour say that the military industrial complex may be in their
[01:19:32.980 --> 01:19:36.660]  saber rattling and trying to get a response from the North Koreans but when
[01:19:36.660 --> 01:19:40.540]  you read the Rand Corporation reports and others they want total war they
[01:19:40.540 --> 01:19:45.060]  want World War three and that's what Joel Scalzen talked about yesterday so
[01:19:45.060 --> 01:19:48.500]  it's very dangerous we'll come back great points on Nate talked to Jeff
[01:19:48.500 --> 01:19:53.460]  David Jason Nick and many others then we've got Wayne Madsen popping in to
[01:19:53.460 --> 01:19:57.420]  give us his take on this I'm tempted to get Joel Scalzen to pop into Mara he was
[01:19:57.420 --> 01:20:01.420]  already on yesterday but this is exactly we was talking about yesterday normal

[01:24:31.500 --> 01:24:35.940]  doing well doing all right what's on your mind yeah in regards to what you
[01:24:35.940 --> 01:24:39.820]  previously called it said what you said I think that the timing of all of this is
[01:24:39.820 --> 01:24:43.660]  extremely suspect and very convenient considering that tomorrow's national
[01:24:43.660 --> 01:24:48.060]  opt-out day people like me are protesting at our local airports against
[01:24:48.060 --> 01:24:51.460]  the tyranny of the TSA and they've got a knock excuse me a Thanksgiving day
[01:24:51.460 --> 01:24:55.820]  surprise or two in store legislatively speaking and I just think it's a great
[01:24:55.820 --> 01:25:02.580]  great great way to distract the masses right they're trying to pass the Senate
[01:25:02.580 --> 01:25:06.140]  bill to take over all the local farms and ranches and openly shut down anything
[01:25:06.140 --> 01:25:09.940]  they want they're trying to pass the internet censorship bill that's wired
[01:25:09.940 --> 01:25:13.940]  magazine saying that not me you can read the bill they call it draconian no judge
[01:25:13.940 --> 01:25:17.420]  no jury just shut down take whatever free speech the feds want justice
[01:25:17.420 --> 01:25:20.540]  department headed up by people that openly say they want to end free speech
[01:25:20.540 --> 01:25:24.460]  they've got a bunch of other horrible legislation they're trying to ram
[01:25:24.460 --> 01:25:30.260]  through and then magically they go in and provocateur the North Koreans yes
[01:25:30.260 --> 01:25:34.420]  sir I agree 100% and like I said we're gonna be at Charlotte Douglas airport
[01:25:34.420 --> 01:25:37.700]  here's Charlotte tomorrow protesting against the 4th Amendment violations of
[01:25:37.700 --> 01:25:41.340]  our Constitution and then these kind of things come in and then it distracts
[01:25:41.340 --> 01:25:44.460]  everybody and they're you know they put up a smoke signal flare over here
[01:25:44.460 --> 01:25:48.620]  everybody focuses on that and you know and distract us from you know from
[01:25:48.620 --> 01:25:52.420]  being persistent and what we need to accomplish I agree with you but at the
[01:25:52.420 --> 01:25:56.340]  same time this flare could light off the whole fireworks factory this
[01:25:56.340 --> 01:26:00.500]  situation when North Korea is a big deal like you said that's exactly what
[01:26:00.500 --> 01:26:04.300]  they're looking for though right out of chaos comes order right order out of KO
[01:26:04.300 --> 01:26:09.620]  that's their motto is George W. Bush said great points anything else Jeff let's
[01:26:09.620 --> 01:26:12.860]  and keep you and thank you for keeping it biblical tell us about your protest

[01:26:38.540 --> 01:26:43.380]  you take your clothes off I have not submitted to it yet and don't plan on
[01:26:43.380 --> 01:26:49.460]  speedos yeah that'd be kind of horrifying if I did that it was for me to

[01:27:27.180 --> 01:27:31.980]  got back on a visa from North Korea and I was talking to him and he said he took
[01:27:31.980 --> 01:27:35.740]  a whole bunch of pictures and the next day brought him in and I have to say I
[01:27:35.740 --> 01:27:42.700]  could not believe it oh yeah he is the only city in North Korea that has
[01:27:42.700 --> 01:27:46.620]  electricity at night they don't even have enough electricity to power their
[01:27:46.620 --> 01:27:51.620]  traffic lights they have the soldiers all on the borders are guarded by the
[01:27:51.620 --> 01:27:55.580]  mass the mass military to keep them throwing down their weapons and
[01:27:55.580 --> 01:27:59.660]  defecting to the south they've got an elite guard that guards the border
[01:27:59.660 --> 01:28:07.460]  there's bob wire on every beach and tank traps like Normandy all the elites
[01:28:07.460 --> 01:28:13.220]  want Mercedes and they get the Mercedes but they're 30 to 35 years old there
[01:28:13.220 --> 01:28:16.820]  was a he had a picture of a concrete building they started building about 10
[01:28:16.820 --> 01:28:23.060]  years ago it looked like it was built by mud doppers it was about 30 it was
[01:28:23.060 --> 01:28:28.940]  about 30 stories tall and it was a solid concrete 30 stories well they tried to
[01:28:28.940 --> 01:28:31.820]  build the biggest building in the world it looks like some science fiction

[01:37:26.180 --> 01:37:31.460]  University of Mississippi rejoined the Navy in ROTC he then joined the US Navy
[01:37:31.460 --> 01:37:36.060]  when he got out of college and was in submarine anti warfare he also worked
[01:37:36.060 --> 01:37:39.860]  for RCA as a government consultant then with the National Security Agency NSA
[01:37:39.860 --> 01:37:44.620]  later he worked with the Navy's National Data Automated Command he's written
[01:37:44.620 --> 01:37:48.860]  for many of the biggest publications in the country and he's also part of Epic
[01:37:48.860 --> 01:37:54.220]  the Electronic Privacy Information Center and he has the Wayne Madsen report
[01:37:54.220 --> 01:38:00.100]  dot com and I wanted to get him on in less than 12 hours into this Korean
[01:38:00.100 --> 01:38:04.820]  Peninsula situation of course we have this report from two years ago by Paul
[01:38:04.820 --> 01:38:12.860]  Joseph Watson and by Ian die Rand lobbies Pentagon start war to save US
[01:38:12.860 --> 01:38:18.460]  economy and it goes into the Rand Corporation saying they need a war we
[01:38:18.460 --> 01:38:26.940]  also have the Washington Post here in my stack where they talk about Obama
[01:38:26.940 --> 01:38:35.180]  needing a war David Broder does a war to be able to continue his agenda I'll
[01:38:35.180 --> 01:38:39.260]  dig that out and pull it out and show it to you in a minute but the fact that
[01:38:39.260 --> 01:38:43.140]  Obama's there last week the fact that they the north had said don't come into
[01:38:43.140 --> 01:38:46.580]  these islands don't fire your artillery in our area and then they sent them in
[01:38:46.580 --> 01:38:51.980]  to do it the fact that it looks like this torpedo that hit the ship a while
[01:38:51.980 --> 01:38:55.820]  back ago was German again I'm not saying the North Koreans are good folks
[01:38:55.820 --> 01:39:00.620]  they're proxies of the Chinese but this on the heel of the Chinese Wayne Madsen
[01:39:00.620 --> 01:39:05.420]  and others believe firing that missile two weeks ago as a way to menace the
[01:39:05.420 --> 01:39:10.940]  West ahead of the G20 I want to get Wayne Madsen's take on all this Wayne
[01:39:10.940 --> 01:39:15.660]  what's your view on it well I again you know North Korea is a very paranoid
[01:39:15.660 --> 01:39:21.620]  regime it's Stalinist but they've made several overtures to the West I would
[01:39:21.620 --> 01:39:26.220]  note that this incident follows their invitation to an American scientist who
[01:39:26.220 --> 01:39:31.340]  took them to a new uranium enrichment facility where he saw plenty of centrifuge
[01:39:31.340 --> 01:39:35.740]  is ready to start enriching uranium now why did the North Koreans do that
[01:39:35.740 --> 01:39:39.460]  obviously they're sending a message we've got this but we want you to know
[01:39:39.460 --> 01:39:43.940]  it they're not trying to hide it they've asked the United States for years to
[01:39:43.940 --> 01:39:50.540]  open diplomatic relations with the North which could lead remember that technically
[01:39:50.540 --> 01:39:55.900]  in a state of war we have an armistice we don't have a peace agreement between
[01:39:55.900 --> 01:40:02.860]  the two countries so there have been as you mentioned these incidents where last
[01:40:02.860 --> 01:40:09.780]  this past March we had the South Korean Corvette in an area there was the US
[01:40:09.780 --> 01:40:13.820]  joint US South Korean exercises that was an island further to the west from
[01:40:13.820 --> 01:40:19.660]  where this island this island called Young Pyong that that other one back in
[01:40:19.660 --> 01:40:24.260]  March was the westernmost island but all these islands stood right off the coast
[01:40:24.260 --> 01:40:30.260]  of Korea so they're highly militarized highly sensitive areas and when the US
[01:40:30.260 --> 01:40:35.740]  and or South Koreans engage in military exercises in the area they always
[01:40:35.740 --> 01:40:41.620]  engender a negative response from the North we have to remember as nutty as
[01:40:41.620 --> 01:40:48.740]  Kim Jong-il who's now turning over the reins of power to his son as crazy as he
[01:40:48.740 --> 01:40:52.820]  is the South Korean president Lee Myung-bak is just as crazy he's a
[01:40:52.820 --> 01:40:57.900]  right-winger he's very unpopular in South Korea the South Koreans don't like
[01:40:57.900 --> 01:41:02.700]  him he's always rattling sabers and I believe on the heels of him most in G20
[01:41:02.700 --> 01:41:08.140]  the fact that you got a South Korean as Secretary General of the UN all this
[01:41:08.140 --> 01:41:14.660]  plays into Lee Myung-bak also flexing his muscles as much as the people that
[01:41:14.660 --> 01:41:18.940]  run North Korea like thinkers that's a recipe for disaster and instead of
[01:41:18.940 --> 01:41:25.140]  coaxing the North by staging exercises in North Korean wars the US should be
[01:41:25.140 --> 01:41:34.500]  pulling back on this activity rather than projecting its military presence it
[01:41:34.500 --> 01:41:41.180]  right into the North Koreans face well I've also got David Broder just a month
[01:41:41.180 --> 01:41:47.500]  ago on October 31st less than a month ago telling Obama hey start a war you
[01:41:47.500 --> 01:41:53.340]  know North Korea Iran whatever we've got neocons telling him to do it we've got
[01:41:53.340 --> 01:41:57.340]  all these Obama advisors saying you need some type of crisis to look strong
[01:41:57.340 --> 01:42:02.340]  you've got the dollar plunging now it's going back up today because people run
[01:42:02.340 --> 01:42:06.940]  to that safe haven because this empire has the biggest military this is on the
[01:42:06.940 --> 01:42:11.140]  heels of the meeting over there we know this is a provocation to send these
[01:42:11.140 --> 01:42:15.660]  ships into this disputed area when North Korea said they would fire on them and
[01:42:15.660 --> 01:42:18.420]  so clearly they're looking for a provocation I mean there's no doubt of
[01:42:18.420 --> 01:42:24.060]  that right now the news media is trading this is you know North Korea always is
[01:42:24.060 --> 01:42:29.220]  a good you know it's like central from central casting the enemy that we're
[01:42:29.220 --> 01:42:35.100]  about to have secretive unpredictable I mean how many times has James Bond been
[01:42:35.100 --> 01:42:44.580]  after North Koreans you know James Bond movies but the fact is that the South
[01:42:44.580 --> 01:42:49.580]  is just as unpredictable I would note that the South is now installing a
[01:42:49.580 --> 01:42:54.500]  ballistic missile system backed up by a radar system they're getting from Israel
[01:42:54.500 --> 01:43:01.300]  so the North doesn't look with favor on this type of thing we also had China
[01:43:01.300 --> 01:43:06.420]  upset about similar US naval exercises with South Korean independent ones right
[01:43:06.420 --> 01:43:11.580]  off the Chinese coast they feel look if you're going to do that off our coast we
[01:43:11.580 --> 01:43:15.140]  can do things off your coast to let you know that we can more than anything else
[01:43:15.140 --> 01:43:21.780]  so we also saw that the incident with the South Korean ship being sunk which a
[01:43:21.780 --> 01:43:25.740]  lot of people including myself and this was verified by people very close to
[01:43:25.740 --> 01:43:29.900]  both the North Korean government the Chinese government and the US government
[01:43:29.900 --> 01:43:36.020]  felt that that was a provocation to get the Japanese Prime Minister Hattiyama
[01:43:36.020 --> 01:43:40.860]  to renege on his campaign promise of throwing the US out of Okinawa he
[01:43:40.860 --> 01:43:46.820]  changed his mind he was attacked by his own party he resigned and now a pro-U.S.
[01:43:46.820 --> 01:43:52.340]  Prime Minister is in Tokyo and he's helping rattle the state along with
[01:43:52.340 --> 01:43:57.180]  the Americans and South Koreans against North Korea and it's a nice political
[01:43:57.180 --> 01:44:01.540]  diversion how does this tie in going back to the Chinese missile a if you got
[01:44:01.540 --> 01:44:07.820]  any more intel confirming your sources that that was a Chinese missile a b why
[01:44:07.820 --> 01:44:11.580]  did they do it see how does this tie into this latest situation we know both
[01:44:11.580 --> 01:44:17.180]  the West uses South Korea as a proxy and China uses North Korea as a proxy right
[01:44:17.180 --> 01:44:22.180]  and there's that now sources very close to norad that are saying yes it was a
[01:44:22.180 --> 01:44:26.260]  Chinese missile and that President Obama was informed immediately by the
[01:44:26.260 --> 01:44:33.180]  commander of norad about the incident and all he did of course was keep it keep
[01:44:33.180 --> 01:44:37.500]  it tamped down he was getting ready to meet the Chinese president in Seoul and
[01:44:37.500 --> 01:44:44.340]  again in Yokohama Japan I would also point out that the Jackson deal in an
[01:44:44.340 --> 01:44:49.260]  op-ed piece in the Washington Post appointed to the amateurs running the
[01:44:49.260 --> 01:44:54.340]  foreign policy for the Obama administration he said basically his
[01:44:54.340 --> 01:45:00.980]  corner of advisors are ex-Senator Hillary Clinton an ex-congressional
[01:45:00.980 --> 01:45:06.900]  staffer Tom Donovan is national security advisor and a lawyer Lee Nantanetta is
[01:45:06.900 --> 01:45:10.860]  running the CIA and you know basically he was pointing out where's the foreign
[01:45:10.860 --> 01:45:17.020]  policy gravitas there it's not so you know remember what Ronald manual said
[01:45:17.020 --> 01:45:22.060]  never let a good crisis go to waste is it is also an attempt to boost Obama's
[01:45:22.060 --> 01:45:26.220]  commander-in-chief credentials but I think it's coming in a very bad time when
[01:45:26.220 --> 01:45:33.460]  US-Chinese relations are very very afraid now he wanted to pitch some sort of
[01:45:33.460 --> 01:45:38.180]  associate membership status or a partnership status with Russia on this
[01:45:38.180 --> 01:45:43.380]  missile shield and the Chinese look at that is bringing NATO right to its own
[01:45:43.380 --> 01:45:49.540]  borders with Russia so and then of course China pushed the idea of India
[01:45:49.540 --> 01:45:53.100]  joining the UN Security Council something else that China is very much opposed to
[01:45:53.100 --> 01:45:59.980]  so it looks like Obama is he's poking his finger in the Chinese eye maybe he
[01:45:59.980 --> 01:46:05.580]  forgets that China owns a great deal of our debt but again maybe this is back
[01:46:05.580 --> 01:46:09.820]  to the Washington Post op-ed where you know this guy's not the smartest guy in
[01:46:09.820 --> 01:46:14.340]  the world we all you know just because so many speaks well actors speak well
[01:46:14.340 --> 01:46:17.860]  because they weren't room to the lines but there's some of them are the dumbest
[01:46:17.860 --> 01:46:21.900]  people on the face of the earth let's expand on that dealing with South
[01:46:21.900 --> 01:46:27.980]  Korea their president is saying now that he may just go ahead and order his
[01:46:27.980 --> 01:46:32.780]  air force to bomb their missile sites and I guess their nuclear sites so that
[01:46:32.780 --> 01:46:36.820]  is an incredible escalation but I guess they've got the pretext now because the
[01:46:36.820 --> 01:46:41.220]  north took the bait when they went into those those those disputed waters and
[01:46:41.220 --> 01:46:45.380]  engaged in the in the in naval bombardments right off their coast I
[01:46:45.380 --> 01:46:49.500]  mean it looks like they're trying to set the precedent the the pretext the
[01:46:49.500 --> 01:46:54.140]  excuse the rationale the moral authority to go ahead and attack the north what
[01:46:54.140 --> 01:46:59.780]  if a do you agree with that and be if they do that why is why is South Korea
[01:46:59.780 --> 01:47:04.180]  being given the green light by the Anglo-Americans to do this well as I
[01:47:04.180 --> 01:47:08.780]  mentioned we went back to South Korea and the president is a very cagey and
[01:47:08.780 --> 01:47:12.900]  unpredictable character he's a he's a real right-winger he's a real meal
[01:47:12.900 --> 01:47:19.020]  neocon type and not they may fit into this the global strategy of increasing
[01:47:19.020 --> 01:47:23.780]  tensions where tensions don't need to be increased and certainly we have the UN
[01:47:23.780 --> 01:47:29.780]  Truce Commission at Panmunjom right on right on in the DMZ these types of
[01:47:29.780 --> 01:47:33.060]  incidents should be being discussed by the United Nations now I would note
[01:47:33.060 --> 01:47:38.300]  that the UN Security Council supposed to meet tomorrow morning but the UN also
[01:47:38.300 --> 01:47:43.220]  needs to put the reins on the president Lee of South Korea because he's
[01:47:43.220 --> 01:47:49.300]  obviously he's not popular he's going to use this as a pretext to increase his
[01:47:49.300 --> 01:47:53.860]  own poll ratings with the South Korean people but I think most of the South Koreans
[01:47:53.860 --> 01:47:58.460]  saw his fingerprints on the thinking of the Chiyonan the South Korean Corvette
[01:47:58.460 --> 01:48:03.780]  last March and they probably see his fingerprints on on this you know trying
[01:48:03.780 --> 01:48:08.860]  to boost his popularity in his image and so far the Western media is treating
[01:48:08.860 --> 01:48:13.980]  South Korea as an innocent victim when in fact they're not totally blame this
[01:48:13.980 --> 01:48:19.060]  every time there's these incidents with the north Wayne do you agree with the
[01:48:19.060 --> 01:48:23.740]  Russia and their Foreign Minister saying quote this is a colossal danger that
[01:48:23.740 --> 01:48:29.020]  could trigger a larger regional war or even a conflagration oh absolutely
[01:48:29.020 --> 01:48:33.980]  because we have to remember that the South Korean capital was within range of
[01:48:33.980 --> 01:48:41.780]  North Korean nuclear artillery shells so you can imagine what would happen it's
[01:48:41.780 --> 01:48:46.940]  all out war breaks out there would obviously be a US nuclear response
[01:48:46.940 --> 01:48:51.580]  against North Korea because we saw these stories though that they're really
[01:48:51.580 --> 01:48:56.980]  just testing you know giant deposits of of TNT underground and that the
[01:48:56.980 --> 01:49:01.980]  signature doesn't show a real a bomb but then we see more evidence and in
[01:49:01.980 --> 01:49:05.500]  Jane's weapons quarterly who is very respected says they do have several
[01:49:05.500 --> 01:49:10.540]  weapons what's your intel do they really have functioning deployable a bombs oh
[01:49:10.540 --> 01:49:14.580]  yes well they've already tested one it wasn't a perfect test but they we know
[01:49:14.580 --> 01:49:19.540]  they've tested they've also tested several of their missiles including
[01:49:19.540 --> 01:49:25.980]  firing some over Japan but this is a regime that we should be we should have
[01:49:25.980 --> 01:49:29.860]  an embassy in Pyongyang just like we should have embassies in Tehran Iran
[01:49:29.860 --> 01:49:36.340]  and also in Havana Cuba but because of certain interest groups that that
[01:49:36.340 --> 01:49:40.820]  basically veto US foreign policy for their own narrow interest we're not
[01:49:40.820 --> 01:49:45.020]  allowed to open up to these and that keeps Kim Jong-il in power that keeps
[01:49:45.020 --> 01:49:50.340]  Fidel Castro in power and I'm a data jot in power and and and and where we
[01:49:50.340 --> 01:49:54.660]  should be this and now obviously we have this big scandal with US embassies
[01:49:54.660 --> 01:49:59.300]  all around the world that you know carrying out espionage against the
[01:49:59.300 --> 01:50:03.780]  citizens of those countries you know having a US embassy of course comes
[01:50:03.780 --> 01:50:07.620]  with mixed bless yeah that's friendly nations our government has them in
[01:50:07.620 --> 01:50:13.500]  friendly nations I mean I was just filling Lister's in on the latest scandal
[01:50:13.500 --> 01:50:17.180]  is friendly nations that our government's carrying on espionage on yeah
[01:50:17.180 --> 01:50:20.820]  like Iceland and Denmark and Finland obviously we're not it you know we're
[01:50:20.820 --> 01:50:27.020]  not at loggerheads with any of those but but be that as it may I think what
[01:50:27.020 --> 01:50:31.940]  the post op-ed article was talking about is there's just a lack of diplomatic
[01:50:31.940 --> 01:50:36.700]  experience with this Obama administration they they've tried away from
[01:50:36.700 --> 01:50:40.900]  using the academics they've tried away from using that the career diplomats
[01:50:40.900 --> 01:50:47.140]  and they're going basically with these political hacks who have the final say
[01:50:47.140 --> 01:50:51.540]  Wayne stay there let's talk more about that when we come back and our government
[01:50:51.540 --> 01:50:55.020]  spying with espionage on friendly friendly nations stay there

[01:54:20.500 --> 01:54:37.740]  okay looking at the different interests involved we know we have this
[01:54:37.740 --> 01:54:41.580]  little hermit empire is a redditary dictatorship that's where communism
[01:54:41.580 --> 01:54:48.380]  always goes black uniforms secret police surveillance torture cannibalism the
[01:54:48.380 --> 01:54:54.500]  fruits of collectivism run by the state and you've got the meeting last week
[01:54:54.500 --> 01:55:01.980]  there in South Korea the G20 you've got the Rand Corporation and others saying
[01:55:01.980 --> 01:55:06.780]  how much they need a new war you've got the Washington Post saying that Obama
[01:55:06.780 --> 01:55:15.100]  needs a new war to get his agenda going we had Ron Paul on last hour and he
[01:55:15.100 --> 01:55:20.680]  incurred that this is driving the dollar back up and that this could be the
[01:55:20.680 --> 01:55:24.780]  military industrial complex trying to stage a provocation well they knew it
[01:55:24.780 --> 01:55:29.620]  was a area that the North claims is theirs right off their coast they know
[01:55:29.620 --> 01:55:33.500]  that if they went in there and fired artillery they'd be fired on the North
[01:55:33.500 --> 01:55:40.420]  warned them and so this is a provocation and it's being done for a lot of
[01:55:40.420 --> 01:55:45.020]  different reasons but but Wayne Madsen recapping what's your gut on this one of
[01:55:45.020 --> 01:55:49.220]  what are the real reasons for this well I would note that same islands all
[01:55:49.220 --> 01:55:55.620]  skirmishes between North and South Korea in 1999 and again in 2002 but none of
[01:55:55.620 --> 01:56:01.540]  those ended up in a artillery exchange the worst actually since the ending of
[01:56:01.540 --> 01:56:06.700]  the Korean War the armistice none of those other incidents that went that far
[01:56:06.700 --> 01:56:11.100]  why did this particular one go that far I think that's the question needs to be
[01:56:11.100 --> 01:56:17.300]  asked who's in charge of policy we've got you know Robert Gates the bush guy
[01:56:17.300 --> 01:56:22.260]  still is our Secretary of Defense he's been rattling sabers against China
[01:56:22.260 --> 01:56:28.660]  North Korea since he's been in his job and I think we have to look at the
[01:56:28.660 --> 01:56:32.980]  fact that there's not a heck of a lot of sunlight between the policies of the
[01:56:32.980 --> 01:56:39.620]  Obama administration and those of his predecessors are George W. Bush we're
[01:56:39.620 --> 01:56:42.780]  almost out of time Wayne Madsen shifting gears over to the issue that
[01:56:42.780 --> 01:56:49.260]  broke a week or so ago friendly countries northern European countries US
[01:56:49.260 --> 01:56:53.460]  embassies being used to run espionage operation they're running they're running
[01:56:53.460 --> 01:56:56.620]  horrors to compromise people they're running surveillance they're running
[01:56:56.620 --> 01:57:00.300]  infiltration of friendly governments I mean my view is that our governments
[01:57:00.300 --> 01:57:04.180]  run by the mega corporations so of course they're going to use our government
[01:57:04.180 --> 01:57:09.420]  as a mechanism to go out there and spy on everyone our allies are shocked by
[01:57:09.420 --> 01:57:13.820]  this but America attacks America America attacks everything America is a
[01:57:13.820 --> 01:57:19.260]  corporate takeover in action absolutely and you know I would point out that the
[01:57:19.260 --> 01:57:24.300]  US Embassy in Reykjavik ice one was spying on Icelanders who which ones the
[01:57:24.300 --> 01:57:28.420]  ones that are out protesting the giveaway of their country to the banking
[01:57:28.420 --> 01:57:33.260]  sheisters I mean we got to figure out that the US Embassy in Dublin Ireland
[01:57:33.260 --> 01:57:38.500]  doing the same thing US Embassy seem to be carrying out this espionage I went
[01:57:38.500 --> 01:57:42.860]  back and looked at the privacy impact assessment a cementified state department
[01:57:42.860 --> 01:57:45.940]  on this system called the security incident management analysis system or
[01:57:45.940 --> 01:57:51.820]  seamless it said that every US Embassy and every US consulate and
[01:57:51.820 --> 01:57:56.260]  intersection abroad had this system so every US Embassy every diplomatic
[01:57:56.260 --> 01:58:02.140]  mission abroad is buying on the people in those countries I think that's
[01:58:02.140 --> 01:58:06.420]  grounds to basically several relations and tell the US Embassy to pack up and
[01:58:06.420 --> 01:58:14.500]  get out Wayne where do you expect just in 30 seconds this this North Korea
[01:58:14.500 --> 01:58:20.340]  situation ago I think China is working behind the scenes try to camp down this
[01:58:20.340 --> 01:58:23.380]  problem they're probably talking to North Koreans the Russians are talking to
[01:58:23.380 --> 01:58:27.500]  North Koreans but the US also has to restrain lean young boss the South
[01:58:27.500 --> 01:58:31.500]  Korean president from doing anything like a retaliatory strike on North Korea
[01:58:31.500 --> 01:58:34.820]  could this be a replay of 888 we're Cheney trying to start war with the
[01:58:34.820 --> 01:58:39.740]  Russians all right Wayne Madsen thank you so much for joining us we'll be right

[02:00:20.660 --> 02:00:32.180]  Alex Jones well for the next 20 minutes judge Andrew Napolitano joins us he of
[02:00:32.180 --> 02:00:35.300]  course for the last week has now moved from the weekends with the number one
[02:00:35.300 --> 02:00:40.220]  show in months a lot of the gates was number one on Fox Business on the
[02:00:40.220 --> 02:00:46.140]  weekends to the regular Fox Business week nights and it's becoming very very
[02:00:46.140 --> 02:00:50.380]  successful there as well so from the weekends to weekdays and hopefully very
[02:00:50.380 --> 02:00:54.820]  soon the main Fox channel because he's a real libertarian at heart and we
[02:00:54.820 --> 02:01:00.100]  always appreciate having judge Andrew Napolitano judge nap.com also best
[02:01:00.100 --> 02:01:04.500]  selling author with us judge this is a short segment the long segments coming
[02:01:04.500 --> 02:01:08.660]  up but so much going on in the world today what's most important on your radar
[02:01:08.660 --> 02:01:13.620]  I think the president wants to subjugate us Alex I think the president who
[02:01:13.620 --> 02:01:17.980]  falsely claims that he believes in civil liberties who took an oath to uphold
[02:01:17.980 --> 02:01:22.940]  the Constitution and who could stop all of this with a with a phone call to
[02:01:22.940 --> 02:01:26.860]  cousin Janet we're not related but I kiddingly refer it to her that way
[02:01:26.860 --> 02:01:34.060]  John Napolitano has placed armed and unarmed uniformed agents between
[02:01:34.060 --> 02:01:38.180]  private carriers and their customers at the most critical juncture parking
[02:01:38.180 --> 02:01:43.180]  orders demanding conformity threatening arrest and fines I think this is the
[02:01:43.180 --> 02:01:47.180]  beginning of an effort of this president to use powers from some sort of
[02:01:47.180 --> 02:01:51.140]  source other than the Constitution an argument is predecessor made to get us
[02:01:51.140 --> 02:01:57.740]  to conform to his will I fear that this TSA stormtrooper behavior is the tip of
[02:01:57.740 --> 02:02:03.140]  an iceberg or an ocean that this administration now that it is lost some
[02:02:03.140 --> 02:02:08.660]  of its strength in Congress may want to use to overwhelm us well we know and you
[02:02:08.660 --> 02:02:13.620]  were critical of George Bush and and and the police state things he carried out
[02:02:13.620 --> 02:02:18.380]  Obama's continued the torture the wars in some cases expanded some of the
[02:02:18.380 --> 02:02:22.580]  extraordinary rendition the enhanced interrogations but because he's got a
[02:02:22.580 --> 02:02:28.540]  leftist cover the other left is gonna been in a coma dealing with it but now
[02:02:28.540 --> 02:02:37.220]  this TSA hands in pants and we've got all of this happening I mean it really
[02:02:37.220 --> 02:02:43.260]  does show their their lust to dominate us and to basically break those taboos
[02:02:43.260 --> 02:02:46.820]  and you're right they've announced they want TSA scanners on the streets
[02:02:46.820 --> 02:02:50.580]  they're already beta testing at train stations TSA has been searching people's
[02:02:50.580 --> 02:02:54.180]  bags without warrants for years in New York so you're right I mean this is
[02:02:54.180 --> 02:02:58.060]  something they want to roll out nationwide you know the most specific
[02:02:58.060 --> 02:03:03.180]  part of the Constitution the one that provides the most details as to what the
[02:03:03.180 --> 02:03:07.540]  government may and may not do is the fourth amendment which establishes the
[02:03:07.540 --> 02:03:11.820]  right to privacy the right to be left alone and it basically says the right of
[02:03:11.820 --> 02:03:17.740]  the people to be secure in their persons houses papers and effects in their
[02:03:17.740 --> 02:03:22.180]  persons meaning their bodies and the Supreme Court has ruled in some cases
[02:03:22.180 --> 02:03:25.780]  with which you and I agree and in some with which you and I disagree nevertheless
[02:03:25.780 --> 02:03:31.820]  it is uniformly ruled that you own your body and the government cannot touch it
[02:03:31.820 --> 02:03:37.260]  or go near it or go inside of it without an order from a judge after the judge
[02:03:37.260 --> 02:03:41.340]  has heard arguments from both sides and the government has proved its right to
[02:03:41.340 --> 02:03:45.300]  do so because the Constitution presumes that we are innocent until proven
[02:03:45.300 --> 02:03:50.980]  guilty yet the TSA not by a law that Congress wrote but by a regulation
[02:03:50.980 --> 02:03:54.580]  written by a couple of faceless bureaucrats nameless until a few weeks
[02:03:54.580 --> 02:03:58.780]  ago has turned that presumption of innocence upside down and treats
[02:03:58.780 --> 02:04:02.140]  everyone as if they were entering a prison rather than getting on to a
[02:04:02.140 --> 02:04:07.820]  private airliner absolutely and expanding on that they are having
[02:04:07.820 --> 02:04:11.580]  federally funded checkpoints that violate the fourth amendment federally funded
[02:04:11.580 --> 02:04:16.260]  blood draws at DWI checkpoints no refusal they they're trying to push
[02:04:16.260 --> 02:04:20.980]  forced inoculations this is clearly their attempt to set the precedent to get
[02:04:20.980 --> 02:04:25.020]  in our space and put their hands on our body and Ron Paul told me an hour and a
[02:04:25.020 --> 02:04:29.580]  half ago that they've grabbed his genitals I did not know that I'm Ron was

[02:07:01.740 --> 02:07:05.460]  five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator number
[02:07:05.460 --> 02:07:09.260]  one new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill
[02:07:09.260 --> 02:07:13.780]  number two our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric
[02:07:13.780 --> 02:07:17.980]  company allows you to have it's true total government control of electricity
[02:07:17.980 --> 02:07:22.620]  in the name of smart grid technology is coming number three in some areas of the
[02:07:22.620 --> 02:07:26.580]  country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist
[02:07:26.580 --> 02:07:30.740]  legislation is only compounding the problem number four dangerous weather
[02:07:30.740 --> 02:07:34.700]  is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of families lose their
[02:07:34.700 --> 02:07:38.860]  power from weather-related onages number five a solar power generator provides
[02:07:38.860 --> 02:07:42.660]  powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks I really believe in the solar

[02:08:43.460 --> 02:08:47.180]  promote somebody like Napolitano because he tells the truth he's a
[02:08:47.180 --> 02:08:51.380]  constitutionalist he was against Bush when he was pushing tyranny he's against
[02:08:51.380 --> 02:08:55.620]  Obama when he's pushing tyranny he talks about the New World Order if you just
[02:08:55.620 --> 02:08:58.860]  joined us we were discussing the TSA in the last segment you were getting into
[02:08:58.860 --> 02:09:03.260]  Ron Paul who you interviewed last night and his Jeffersonian argument against
[02:09:03.260 --> 02:09:07.060]  the TSA go ahead well Ron Paul made the same argument that Jefferson did which
[02:09:07.060 --> 02:09:11.420]  is interestingly the same argument that the now iconic heroic young man from
[02:09:11.420 --> 02:09:15.460]  San Diego Med made at the San Diego Airport two weeks ago when he said
[02:09:15.460 --> 02:09:20.860]  don't touch my jump referring to his private parts if if I can't do it to
[02:09:20.860 --> 02:09:27.260]  you then I can't give the government the power to do it to you if you take a
[02:09:27.260 --> 02:09:32.460]  swing at me I can take a swing back but I can't invite you onto my property and
[02:09:32.460 --> 02:09:36.580]  presume the right to touch your private parts as a condition of your coming on
[02:09:36.580 --> 02:09:41.740]  to the property stated differently the only powers the government has of the
[02:09:41.740 --> 02:09:46.340]  powers we give it and the only powers we give it are the powers that we have to
[02:09:46.340 --> 02:09:51.700]  give it we don't have the power to touch someone else private in their private
[02:09:51.700 --> 02:09:56.060]  parts against their will no matter what they're doing it's a sexual assault
[02:09:56.060 --> 02:10:00.660]  whether it's done by the Gardner by a school teacher by a member of the clergy
[02:10:00.660 --> 02:10:03.340]  or by somebody wearing a government uniform
[02:10:03.340 --> 02:10:08.940]  Congressman Paul not only articulated that so nicely on my show he introduced a
[02:10:08.940 --> 02:10:13.100]  piece of legislation that's ten lines long which would stop this in a heartbeat
[02:10:13.100 --> 02:10:18.820]  but it will never see the heart of day why do you think speaker designate John
[02:10:18.820 --> 02:10:24.980]  Boehner who flies commercial from Cincinnati to Washington several days a
[02:10:24.980 --> 02:10:29.380]  week was permitted to walk around the scanners and around the Gropers is it
[02:10:29.380 --> 02:10:33.500]  because they recognize him well of course they recognize him it's because they
[02:10:33.500 --> 02:10:37.860]  want him on their side you broke the member of Congress he's gonna vote
[02:10:37.860 --> 02:10:41.500]  against this you let him walk around the Gropers he's gonna say yeah go ahead
[02:10:41.500 --> 02:10:47.340]  keep us so this is true discrimination at its heart but but what about my point
[02:10:47.340 --> 02:10:50.620]  that this violates the 9th and 10th Amendment I guess that goes to the
[02:10:50.620 --> 02:10:54.420]  Jeffersonian point the 10th Amendment says that the powers not given to the
[02:10:54.420 --> 02:10:58.460]  federal government are retained by the states and the people and we never gave
[02:10:58.460 --> 02:11:03.080]  the Constitution nowhere gave the federal government the power to keep us
[02:11:03.080 --> 02:11:06.820]  safe that is the obligation of the individuals and of the states and the
[02:11:06.820 --> 02:11:11.780]  9th Amendment says just because we have enumerated certain rights in this
[02:11:11.780 --> 02:11:16.420]  Constitution it doesn't mean that there are other natural rights that the people
[02:11:16.420 --> 02:11:21.780]  don't have stated differently your right to bodily integrity you have it
[02:11:21.780 --> 02:11:25.180]  whether it's mentioned in the Constitution or not it's a natural
[02:11:25.180 --> 02:11:29.120]  so judge what is this attempt then what do you think's behind this they know
[02:11:29.120 --> 02:11:33.500]  brazenly ordering them to put their hands down the pants now and to record
[02:11:33.500 --> 02:11:37.660]  our naked images of our body which they've been caught doing they know this
[02:11:37.660 --> 02:11:43.020]  is 180 degrees polar opposite of a Liberty culture it's a tyranny culture
[02:11:43.020 --> 02:11:47.860]  so is this the furor precept that Bush tried where they said well it's not
[02:11:47.860 --> 02:11:51.580]  illegal when the president does it you know tortures illegal but it's not
[02:11:51.580 --> 02:11:55.740]  illegal of the president orders it is this just more of this control freak
[02:11:55.740 --> 02:12:00.940]  religion of pushing it to the limit it's more of the control freak progressive
[02:12:00.940 --> 02:12:05.500]  with an uppercase t-religion that the government can do whatever it wants
[02:12:05.500 --> 02:12:09.700]  look this morning there were two polls very dismay one said two-thirds of the
[02:12:09.700 --> 02:12:13.540]  American public doesn't object to the porn or the group well most of the
[02:12:13.540 --> 02:12:17.380]  public doesn't fly every day and they haven't exposed to this but the more
[02:12:17.380 --> 02:12:21.660]  terrifying one is that fifty-three percent of Americans think the government
[02:12:21.660 --> 02:12:26.140]  is operating outside the Constitution and aren't doing anything about it if the
[02:12:26.140 --> 02:12:30.460]  government is operating outside the Constitution it's time to change the
[02:12:30.460 --> 02:12:33.940]  government I mean that's about as reckless a thing as you could be the
[02:12:33.940 --> 02:12:37.780]  Constitution equals the rule of law if the government is not obeying the rule
[02:12:37.780 --> 02:12:42.700]  of law how can it impose laws upon us the problem with the Bainer exception to
[02:12:42.700 --> 02:12:47.020]  the TSA should they make an exception from Madonna or Derek Jeter or somebody
[02:12:47.020 --> 02:12:50.220]  else that's well-known is that these bureaucrats are making a bruise on the
[02:12:50.220 --> 02:12:54.460]  spot and then making exceptions to the rules on the spot that is a power that
[02:12:54.460 --> 02:12:58.580]  is not theirs to have only the commerce can make law and it can only do it after
[02:12:58.580 --> 02:13:01.660]  a legitimate debate and a vote by the people's representatives so it's judge
[02:13:01.660 --> 02:13:06.700]  jury and executioner I think the establishment's gonna lose this fight I
[02:13:06.700 --> 02:13:12.380]  I mean I really see this becoming a focal point of people's anger in general you
[02:13:12.380 --> 02:13:16.620]  know I agree with you Alex and I've seen some people that I'm surprised to see on
[02:13:16.620 --> 02:13:21.620]  our side former senator Rick Santorum who almost always sided with big
[02:13:21.620 --> 02:13:26.220]  government sounded like Alex Jones this morning Peter King Republican
[02:13:26.220 --> 02:13:30.420]  congressman from Long Island who always sides with security so the TSA has
[02:13:30.420 --> 02:13:34.260]  become the enemy of the American people congressman John Micah who wrote the
[02:13:34.260 --> 02:13:38.380]  TSA legislation says we have to change this immediately I think this is
[02:13:38.380 --> 02:13:45.740]  starting to sink in across the board it knows no ideological no ethnic no gender
[02:13:45.740 --> 02:13:49.660]  line I think the American public is saying enough is enough but one person
[02:13:49.660 --> 02:13:55.260]  isn't listening and he could stop this with a phone call and that's the
[02:13:55.260 --> 02:14:01.720]  president who wants to induce us to conform to his way of behaving and
[02:14:01.720 --> 02:14:08.700]  thinking just like his predecessor that's Barack H. Obama and they do want
[02:14:08.700 --> 02:14:12.980]  to back off now because they understand if they continue the fight it's only
[02:14:12.980 --> 02:14:17.100]  going to have the American people come together and that's what they're
[02:14:17.100 --> 02:14:22.900]  threatened by speaking of Ron Paul judge I had him on during the first hour and
[02:14:22.900 --> 02:14:28.460]  I went over the Washington Post headline where they talk about you know
[02:14:28.460 --> 02:14:34.820]  using a war to fix the economy of the David Broder article I went over the
[02:14:34.820 --> 02:14:39.780]  Rand Corporation two years ago our article at prisonplanet.com talking
[02:14:39.780 --> 02:14:47.700]  about how they need a larger war so that the dollar stays strong and so that
[02:14:47.700 --> 02:14:50.780]  countries basically go along with the formation of this corporate world
[02:14:50.780 --> 02:14:55.820]  government and Ron Paul agreed with me he said that certainly we have to look
[02:14:55.820 --> 02:15:00.340]  at the military industrial complex staging this provocation not that North
[02:15:00.340 --> 02:15:04.260]  Korea is good they're probably the most evil country on earth this hereditary
[02:15:04.260 --> 02:15:09.260]  dictatorship but going into their waters engaging in a naval exercise
[02:15:09.260 --> 02:15:14.660]  firing artillery and near their shore when the North had warned them that's
[02:15:14.660 --> 02:15:18.820]  clearly a provocation what's your take on this my take on it that the president
[02:15:18.820 --> 02:15:23.020]  that all presidents love war except if Ron Paul became president because they
[02:15:23.020 --> 02:15:26.780]  know that war is the health of the state that people will pay more taxes give up
[02:15:26.780 --> 02:15:30.100]  their liberty and unite behind the soldiers no matter what the outcome
[02:15:30.100 --> 02:15:35.900]  they falsely believe that war will help the economy it's beyond me how taxing
[02:15:35.900 --> 02:15:40.280]  people to purchase equipment and then destroying the equipment helps the
[02:15:40.280 --> 02:15:44.540]  economy but this is a myth that has been perpetrated since Woodrow Wilson
[02:15:44.540 --> 02:15:50.140]  reinforced by FDR used by George W. Bush and we're about to see a Barack Obama
[02:15:50.140 --> 02:15:56.140]  can use it fortunately this is not in our backyard it is 10,000 miles away and
[02:15:56.140 --> 02:16:00.580]  there are voices in both parties on both sides of the aisle are saying no no no
[02:16:00.580 --> 02:16:04.760]  no we're not gonna do this again Ron Paul is leading the charge all right
[02:16:04.760 --> 02:16:07.540]  judge I've got a few other final questions for you and then tell us about
[02:16:07.540 --> 02:16:11.900]  what's coming up tonight on the TV show Glenn Beck who I've been critical of on
[02:16:11.900 --> 02:16:15.660]  many fronts because he's flip-flopped over the years you haven't that's why I
[02:16:15.660 --> 02:16:19.100]  support you and your libertarian views were very close to each other but but
[02:16:19.100 --> 02:16:22.660]  that I'm not trying to attack Glenn he's giving you a big platform to you know
[02:16:22.660 --> 02:16:27.740]  really tell the truth but two weeks ago as you know he came out he read the
[02:16:27.740 --> 02:16:32.660]  quotes by Obama and Clinton officials saying how great a terror attack would
[02:16:32.660 --> 02:16:36.820]  be how it would help them he read the newsletters where they're demonizing
[02:16:36.820 --> 02:16:42.300]  Glenn and myself saying we're gonna cause an Oklahoma City attack and he went
[02:16:42.300 --> 02:16:47.620]  ahead and said these people this is a quote are planning another Oklahoma City
[02:16:47.620 --> 02:16:53.460]  to be blamed on the Liberty Movement that's a big bold shift for Glenn Beck
[02:16:53.460 --> 02:16:57.780]  what's your take on him coming out and talking about false flag terror well I'm
[02:16:57.780 --> 02:17:02.940]  I'm I'm I'm a close friend of Glenn's obviously I don't have any control over
[02:17:02.940 --> 02:17:07.500]  what he says on this show but I appear with him a lot I fill in for him on
[02:17:07.500 --> 02:17:13.500]  television when he's not here and I share a lot of his views I don't know
[02:17:13.500 --> 02:17:18.980]  anything about what he just said but I do believe that this government would
[02:17:18.980 --> 02:17:24.380]  welcome the type of conflagration that we have seen in the past if it would help
[02:17:24.380 --> 02:17:28.820]  it become more authoritarian particularly now with the loss of the house
[02:17:28.820 --> 02:17:33.420]  and with a filibuster positive number that the Republicans have and I carry
[02:17:33.420 --> 02:17:37.220]  no water for them as you know yes in the Senate the president is going to have
[02:17:37.220 --> 02:17:42.140]  to rule by decree and the easiest way for him to rule by decree is to accompany
[02:17:42.140 --> 02:17:46.460]  his decree with fear and the easiest way to get that fear is to look the other
[02:17:46.460 --> 02:17:51.900]  way if somebody assaults us okay finally man because I never raised this with you
[02:17:51.900 --> 02:17:55.580]  because you know it's a subject I just leave alone with folks because I don't
[02:17:55.580 --> 02:17:59.340]  want to cause people problems but you brought it up with heraldor Rivera who
[02:17:59.340 --> 02:18:04.980]  says he is concerned about building 7 and and I want to put the question you
[02:18:04.980 --> 02:18:09.180]  put to him to you I mean what do you think of heraldor Rivera coming out
[02:18:09.180 --> 02:18:13.660]  what do you think of seven it's hard for me to believe that it came down by
[02:18:13.660 --> 02:18:19.700]  itself I was gratified to see with heraldor Rivera investigating it I am
[02:18:19.700 --> 02:18:25.060]  gratified to see the people across the board are interested I think 20 years
[02:18:25.060 --> 02:18:30.700]  from now people will look at 9-11 the way we look at the assassination of JFK
[02:18:30.700 --> 02:18:35.580]  today it couldn't possibly have been done the way the government told us well I
[02:18:35.580 --> 02:18:39.740]  want to tell you this you got a lot of courage judge and so does heraldor
[02:18:39.740 --> 02:18:44.500]  Rivera I don't agree with him on some of his more liberal political views but I
[02:18:44.500 --> 02:18:49.220]  do resonate with his courage and I resonate with yours and I already had
[02:18:49.220 --> 02:18:54.100]  the highest respect for you but now the thermometer just broke and the mercury
[02:18:54.100 --> 02:19:00.900]  you know geysering out of it right now judge you are a great American and I
[02:19:00.900 --> 02:19:04.500]  just can't wait till your show's number one on Fox Business when you're on
[02:19:04.500 --> 02:19:09.220]  regular Fox full-time because no army can stop an idea whose time has come in
[02:19:09.220 --> 02:19:14.580]  the two or three minutes left we've got what else is important on your radar
[02:19:14.580 --> 02:19:19.340]  should we call for congressional investigations of Chertoff ordering the TSA
[02:19:19.340 --> 02:19:23.100]  machines and making money off of it what's your view on that and then tell
[02:19:23.100 --> 02:19:27.380]  us about the TV show and what else is on your your radar screen well I'm hoping
[02:19:27.380 --> 02:19:30.700]  that the and again I don't carry water for the Republicans because when they
[02:19:30.700 --> 02:19:33.900]  ran the government before our eyes destroyed what it meant to be a
[02:19:33.900 --> 02:19:38.340]  conservative Republican and I yearn for those views of Barry Goldwater which
[02:19:38.340 --> 02:19:42.300]  were rejected by the Republicans of the Bush years however having divided
[02:19:42.300 --> 02:19:47.340]  government as we now do with the Republicans controlling one House of
[02:19:47.340 --> 02:19:51.220]  Congress of the Democrats controlling the other in the White House will permit
[02:19:51.220 --> 02:19:57.460]  investigations and investigations do induce transparency and do require more
[02:19:57.460 --> 02:20:00.860]  debate but here's an interesting proposal that I'm discussing tonight on
[02:20:00.860 --> 02:20:05.580]  Freedom Watch 8 o'clock Eastern on the Fox Business Network Professor Randy
[02:20:05.580 --> 02:20:09.540]  Barnett good friend of mine good strong libertarian and William Howell the
[02:20:09.540 --> 02:20:13.860]  Speaker of the House of Delegates of the state of Virginia proposing a repeal
[02:20:13.860 --> 02:20:18.340]  amendment to the United States Constitution this would permit the
[02:20:18.340 --> 02:20:25.980]  state legislatures of two-thirds of the states to invalidate any federal law or
[02:20:25.980 --> 02:20:32.220]  regulation they wanted how about that for a check on a runaway Congress now
[02:20:32.220 --> 02:20:35.820]  this is not going to pass overnight it'll probably only pass if we have a
[02:20:35.820 --> 02:20:39.060]  constitutional convention because the Congress will never will never vote for
[02:20:39.060 --> 02:20:42.820]  legislation that would diminish its power but think of the freedom we have in
[02:20:42.820 --> 02:20:46.420]  the land if there were no unfunded mandates if the states could thumb
[02:20:46.420 --> 02:20:49.860]  their noses at the feds and if the feds couldn't and that couldn't enact
[02:20:49.860 --> 02:20:53.500]  legislation unless two-thirds of the states went along with it that's my
[02:20:53.500 --> 02:20:57.340]  back this week aside for the TSA I'm trying to invite cousin Johnette over
[02:20:57.340 --> 02:21:01.300]  to Thanksgiving dinner so I can give her a piece of my mind what's Corsi
[02:21:01.300 --> 02:21:04.340]  covering tonight Corsi's making the argument about
[02:21:04.340 --> 02:21:09.420]  shirt off that this is this is crypto capitalism trying to make money that the
[02:21:09.420 --> 02:21:12.380]  government spent a billion on these things but they're not affected that
[02:21:12.380 --> 02:21:15.900]  they don't work that they harm us if they put the wrong equipment and they
[02:21:15.900 --> 02:21:19.180]  did it because Mike shirt off advice and the do so but isn't this the classic
[02:21:19.180 --> 02:21:23.940]  corruption where the general orders the missile system that doesn't work and
[02:21:23.940 --> 02:21:28.580]  then retires in two years and becomes the CEO of the missile company exactly
[02:21:28.580 --> 02:21:32.100]  it's almost literally what happened I say this is someone that has known Mike
[02:21:32.100 --> 02:21:36.820]  I've invited him on my show I welcome them to express his views but he's he's
[02:21:36.820 --> 02:21:40.700]  at the bottom of a hole trying to dig himself out because it looks very bad it
[02:21:40.700 --> 02:21:44.460]  looks like he concocted the need for this and then decided to go work for the
[02:21:44.460 --> 02:21:48.180]  people that sell it and then he's not willing to acknowledge that he sold the
[02:21:48.180 --> 02:21:52.300]  wrong piece of equipment at the cost of billions well I've got all these video
[02:21:52.300 --> 02:21:55.740]  clips of him a year ago admitting he's making money now they put out a press
[02:21:55.740 --> 02:22:00.220]  release that was in the hills saying he's made no money I mean boy he's gonna
[02:22:00.220 --> 02:22:04.860]  get in a lot of trouble doing that type of crap walk judge here's the question
[02:22:04.860 --> 02:22:09.300]  Alex he's a Republican will Darrell Issa and the chief interrogators of the
[02:22:09.300 --> 02:22:14.180]  Republican House summon one of their own interesting to see what they do well
[02:22:14.180 --> 02:22:18.300]  that's like Obama covering for Bush and then Bush covering for Clinton this
[02:22:18.300 --> 02:22:21.900]  circle of corruption seems to never end but you do agree that the the
[02:22:21.900 --> 02:22:26.580]  acceleration of awakening of true libertarian populism is on fire
[02:22:26.580 --> 02:22:30.620]  absolutely and and it wasn't ten or even five years ago
[02:22:30.620 --> 02:22:34.340]  today it is in closing you got to go judge getting ready for your TV show
[02:22:34.340 --> 02:22:38.620]  tonight tell us about your current book the new book coming out in the new year
[02:22:38.620 --> 02:22:43.740]  and one more plug for the TV show in in April my next book is coming out called
[02:22:43.740 --> 02:22:47.220]  it is dangerous to be right when the government is wrong the case for
[02:22:47.220 --> 02:22:50.540]  personal freedom tells you all the freedoms you have where they came from
[02:22:50.540 --> 02:22:54.300]  what the government has done to take them away and how you can fight back and
[02:22:54.300 --> 02:22:59.820]  freedom watch is seven nights a week 8 p.m. Fox Business Network Alex I can't
[02:22:59.820 --> 02:23:03.340]  thank you enough for this megaphone all right I'm gonna call you giving to you
[02:23:03.340 --> 02:23:06.260]  my friend you too my friend I'll talk to you about 45 minutes give you a quick
[02:23:06.260 --> 02:23:12.180]  call after the show God bless all right there goes judge Andrew Napolitano and
[02:23:12.180 --> 02:23:18.100]  again the fact that Fox is is is giving him a bigger megaphone that shows they
[02:23:18.100 --> 02:23:23.620]  can't stop the times they were buggy whip salesman but the automobile has come
[02:23:23.620 --> 02:23:29.220]  along nobody's riding horses anymore so they're bringing an automobile out for
[02:23:29.220 --> 02:23:33.740]  the public I mean he talks about government staging crises he says
[02:23:33.740 --> 02:23:39.340]  investigate building seven he talks about the New World Order he talks about
[02:23:39.340 --> 02:23:47.260]  stage rights judge nap is awesome he is awesome I disagree with him a little bit
[02:23:47.260 --> 02:23:52.820]  on the Arizona law because I don't believe it's unconstitutional but I
[02:23:52.820 --> 02:23:57.140]  understand the danger of profiling so I so I agree with him partially on that I'm
[02:23:57.140 --> 02:24:00.340]  not you know totally sure on that law we're still gauging it but other than
[02:24:00.340 --> 02:24:04.140]  that I agree with him almost a hundred percent and he's just a wonderful guy
[02:24:04.140 --> 02:24:10.220]  and I think Geraldo Rivera now judge nap are talking about building seven and
[02:24:10.220 --> 02:24:16.460]  and and and not believing it fell on its own from some small fires do you
[02:24:16.460 --> 02:24:23.980]  realize the heresy they are committing against a neo condom the kingdom of
[02:24:23.980 --> 02:24:29.660]  neo con fear mongering and false flag terror I mean you know he is he's
[02:24:29.660 --> 02:24:34.500]  certainly sticking his toe in the water you know when they locked up Galileo for
[02:24:34.500 --> 02:24:38.620]  saying that the earth was on the center of the universe he then agreed to say
[02:24:38.620 --> 02:24:43.340]  he was wrong but before he died he said well actually they do move though now
[02:24:43.340 --> 02:24:48.660]  the planets do move and the moons of Jupiter are moving and then so it's you
[02:24:48.660 --> 02:24:53.260]  know they're kind of creeping up and saying well it does move you know we're
[02:24:53.260 --> 02:24:58.300]  talking about physics here and so who knows if they'll be a persecutor and I'm
[02:24:58.300 --> 02:25:04.140]  sure all the George Soros publications by tomorrow will be judge nap now 9 11
[02:25:04.140 --> 02:25:08.900]  truth there and you know we've already seen the Rand Paul interview we just put
[02:25:08.900 --> 02:25:14.420]  on prison planet dot TV they're like extremism he says that Obama could
[02:25:14.420 --> 02:25:17.940]  become like Hitler well what he said is this government's going in the direction
[02:25:17.940 --> 02:25:23.460]  of power grabs like Hitler just like Naomi Wolf said oh but when you're
[02:25:23.460 --> 02:25:28.140]  talking about the right wing going in a hitlerian direction that's okay just
[02:25:28.140 --> 02:25:32.420]  don't talk about the left wing there is no left wing there is no right wing it's
[02:25:32.420 --> 02:25:37.780]  a corporate wing Wayne Madsen agreed last hour everybody wonders why our own
[02:25:37.780 --> 02:25:42.980]  government spies on our own companies and sells us out to China or why US
[02:25:42.980 --> 02:25:47.060]  embassies in our allied countries are spying and stealing secrets from them
[02:25:47.060 --> 02:25:51.220]  because they're giving them to the fortune 100 that's who runs this country
[02:25:51.220 --> 02:25:56.900]  we don't have a country anymore we have a corporate whorehouse and then main line
[02:25:56.900 --> 02:26:02.020]  Republicans are oh well you know corporations are good they well yeah
[02:26:02.020 --> 02:26:06.020]  the corporation down the street that's got a clothier or that's you know a
[02:26:06.020 --> 02:26:12.860]  mattress factory or making bottles of you know soda pop or you know a corporation
[02:26:12.860 --> 02:26:17.860]  helping homeless people or selling cars or whatever it is we're not talking
[02:26:17.860 --> 02:26:22.380]  about that we're talking about fortune 100 companies bigger than most
[02:26:22.380 --> 02:26:26.620]  government's GDP completely out of control their own private mercenaries
[02:26:26.620 --> 02:26:34.740]  their own private intelligence agencies running wild in society I am sick of it
[02:26:34.740 --> 02:26:40.060]  I'm tired of it they're the ones always pushing for more government to shut
[02:26:40.060 --> 02:26:46.540]  down their competition you know who on record is supporting s510 did if you
[02:26:46.540 --> 02:26:49.980]  read it allows government bureaucracy to shut down any farms or ranches they
[02:26:49.980 --> 02:26:54.820]  want you can't slice up tomatoes and can them you can't put cucumbers in a
[02:26:54.820 --> 02:26:57.820]  in a bottle and can them and sell them to your neighbors or give them to your
[02:26:57.820 --> 02:27:05.220]  neighbors the way it's written you know who lobbied for that Tyson Conagra all
[02:27:05.220 --> 02:27:08.980]  the big boys they want to shut you down where are most of the problems and the
[02:27:08.980 --> 02:27:14.340]  and the violations in food safety I remember reading a decade ago about
[02:27:14.340 --> 02:27:18.420]  Tyson chicken with thousands of violations at one plant and then their
[02:27:18.420 --> 02:27:23.940]  competition got shut down for two or three violations at a plant big
[02:27:23.940 --> 02:27:30.540]  government is a tool of the mega corporations just like in North Korea
[02:27:30.540 --> 02:27:35.300]  the big government is a tool of a hereditary dictatorship and a handful
[02:27:35.300 --> 02:27:40.740]  of scumbag families whose sons become the secret police chief in the town
[02:27:40.740 --> 02:27:46.740]  after they die and now we've got the corporations above the law back to the
[02:27:46.740 --> 02:27:52.580]  law of kings where they have all this sovereignty that's what the new world
[02:27:52.580 --> 02:27:57.140]  order is and I want to get into the economy when we come back and then to
[02:27:57.140 --> 02:28:02.580]  your phone calls for those of you that are patiently holding but we have some
[02:28:02.580 --> 02:28:07.780]  other news dealing with stage terrorism right now and this is out of the
[02:28:07.780 --> 02:28:13.180]  Chicago Tribune we've been predicting that this was coming it is not hard to
[02:28:13.180 --> 02:28:17.460]  predict it it's like the Sun coming up in the morning British Airways wants the
[02:28:17.460 --> 02:28:21.500]  body scanners out the Italians throw them out the US government offers
[02:28:21.500 --> 02:28:25.940]  billions to Europe to pay them to put them in Chertoff's got to get his money
[02:28:25.940 --> 02:28:30.140]  the American people got to be broken we've got to be trained Alfonso
[02:28:30.140 --> 02:28:34.620]  tomorrow's got to get his money he's involved in the scanners suspicious
[02:28:34.620 --> 02:28:41.740]  packages found at cargo building of Boston Logan Airport forces evacuation the
[02:28:41.740 --> 02:28:46.700]  day before the national opt-out day as the people learn to come together as a
[02:28:46.700 --> 02:28:53.220]  national strike against tyranny learning our voluntary collective power not
[02:28:53.220 --> 02:28:58.420]  directed by Kim Jong-il not directed by Barack Obama not directed by Joe Stalin
[02:28:58.420 --> 02:29:04.260]  not directed by Adolf Hitler and the National Socialist know a grassroots
[02:29:04.260 --> 02:29:09.980]  person-to-person opt-out oh my gosh suspicious packages and I'm sure they're
[02:29:09.980 --> 02:29:13.860]  gonna find more and in some cases a day later they'll say it wasn't a bomb or in
[02:29:13.860 --> 02:29:18.500]  some cases they'll say well it looks like it's a bomb or it's a fake bomb right
[02:29:18.500 --> 02:29:23.340]  on time to teach us to love government to teach us that government is our God
[02:29:23.340 --> 02:29:29.340]  what did Rob Shapiro Clinton advisor and advisor to Obama said the bottom line
[02:29:29.340 --> 02:29:33.420]  here is that Americans don't believe President Obama's leadership he has to
[02:29:33.420 --> 02:29:37.460]  find some way now before the November of demonstrating that he is a leader who
[02:29:37.460 --> 02:29:40.900]  could command confidence in short of a new 9-11 or Oklahoma City bombing I
[02:29:40.900 --> 02:29:45.460]  can't think of how he can do just that and now we see more Obama people saying
[02:29:45.460 --> 02:29:49.180]  similar things now okay we're gonna come back give you the latest information

[02:33:42.340 --> 02:33:47.300]  reading out of Chicago Tribune but it's a report out of Boston Logan and we've
[02:33:47.300 --> 02:33:52.300]  been predicting they'll have more fear mongering and more fake packages now
[02:33:52.300 --> 02:33:54.540]  remember what happened with the British this is on record
[02:33:54.540 --> 02:33:59.740]  Obama on the Thursday night before the Friday scare a month ago he's told
[02:33:59.740 --> 02:34:04.620]  there's a plan by and we're all a locky and we'll put this on screen and we're
[02:34:04.620 --> 02:34:10.700]  all a locky dined at the Pentagon after 9 11 we'll put that Fox News AP Reuters
[02:34:10.700 --> 02:34:15.820]  whatever you want it's all over the news the mail online BBC he's on the news at
[02:34:15.820 --> 02:34:20.860]  the time is the number three guy in al Qaeda today they say he's the number one
[02:34:20.860 --> 02:34:26.140]  under bin Laden and he's hanging out with the secretary of the army in the top
[02:34:26.140 --> 02:34:33.060]  brass at the Pentagon this is confirmed so he's behind the Fort Hood shooter he's
[02:34:33.060 --> 02:34:36.220]  behind the Christmas Day underwear bomber who the government admits they were
[02:34:36.220 --> 02:34:42.340]  ordered to help get on the plane undersecretary of the state department
[02:34:42.340 --> 02:34:47.220]  Kennedy said that two months after we broke it with witnesses and there's the
[02:34:47.220 --> 02:34:51.220]  headline we'll put it back on screen al Qaeda leader dined at the Pentagon just
[02:34:51.220 --> 02:34:58.300]  months after 9 11 and I believe that's the Fox News article about it is okay so
[02:34:58.300 --> 02:35:07.100]  you've got that now the British a month ago they say yeah we've tested these
[02:35:07.100 --> 02:35:11.500]  printer cartridge it's it's not a bomb and Obama goes out hours after there's a
[02:35:11.500 --> 02:35:15.500]  press conference and says it was a bomb and the British are told check it again
[02:35:15.500 --> 02:35:24.100]  and they go okay I guess it is not a bomb but bomb material and then you've
[02:35:24.100 --> 02:35:27.940]  got the head of British airwaves having to eat crow who wants the scanners out
[02:35:27.940 --> 02:35:31.100]  because it's killing business you've got the Italian government throwing the
[02:35:31.100 --> 02:35:36.500]  scanners out under pressure now I predicted in the last few weeks you'd
[02:35:36.500 --> 02:35:41.540]  see more of this and then it would be drills because it's always drills it
[02:35:41.540 --> 02:35:46.620]  was a drill today kicking off this new conflict with the North Koreans going
[02:35:46.620 --> 02:35:51.700]  into their waters and simulating attacks and firing artillery and so the North
[02:35:51.700 --> 02:35:58.540]  paranoid state they are attacks start to figure this out here it is fake bomb
[02:35:58.540 --> 02:36:03.820]  aboard German passenger jet was made by US firm to test airport security for two
[02:36:03.820 --> 02:36:08.020]  days somebody tried to blow up a German airline thank God they saved them then
[02:36:08.020 --> 02:36:13.140]  back of the paper minor footnote days later oh it was some type of drill but
[02:36:13.140 --> 02:36:20.940]  the US won't say what firm they hired to do it that's all here in the news so they
[02:36:20.940 --> 02:36:27.900]  do the same thing over and over again and here is a another one out of the
[02:36:27.900 --> 02:36:33.740]  Boston Globe mass port investigating low-level threat in Delta cargo building
[02:36:33.740 --> 02:36:37.380]  at Logan authorities this afternoon are investigating a little of a threat at a
[02:36:37.380 --> 02:36:43.100]  Delta cargo terminal at Boston's Logan Airport after a dog trained to sniff out
[02:36:43.100 --> 02:36:48.700]  explosives reacted to two double bags a mass port spokesman said and so there's
[02:36:48.700 --> 02:36:55.220]  all this hysteria and all this fear now this just came out after the AP article
[02:36:55.220 --> 02:36:59.740]  that was suspicious package found at cargo building of Boston's Logan's
[02:36:59.740 --> 02:37:04.620]  Airport forces and vacuations just all part of this complete nittying culture of
[02:37:04.620 --> 02:37:10.580]  fear we pulled the numbers up 90 to 100 people die a year from bee stings that's
[02:37:10.580 --> 02:37:15.980]  not counting wasp things now do we have checkpoints in every field at every
[02:37:15.980 --> 02:37:24.140]  school to protect us from these al-Qaeda insects that are just everywhere
[02:37:24.140 --> 02:37:31.380]  killing hundreds of our citizens no are they worried about a real threat 28
[02:37:31.380 --> 02:37:36.660]  thousand dead in the last few years on the Mexican US border area no they're
[02:37:36.660 --> 02:37:41.860]  not worried about that they have created this hysterical psychological warfare
[02:37:41.860 --> 02:37:46.180]  fetish to just totally freak out and be scared of the turban men they're gonna
[02:37:46.180 --> 02:37:51.660]  get us any minute and then every time you turn around they're being handled
[02:37:51.660 --> 02:37:56.140]  and protected by the government and I've had the former CIA section chief on we
[02:37:56.140 --> 02:38:01.700]  wrote the book Jawbreaker one of the top CIA operatives in Afghanistan he admitted
[02:38:01.700 --> 02:38:07.300]  the real Taliban al-Qaeda would sell 13 14 15 year old teenagers they had a
[02:38:07.300 --> 02:38:12.100]  pullout two days ago 92% of Afghans don't even know about 9 11 these are
[02:38:12.100 --> 02:38:16.540]  literally cavemen they can't find the US on a map they can't read they can't
[02:38:16.540 --> 02:38:19.940]  write fact pull that up folks won't believe it 92% of Afghans don't even
[02:38:19.940 --> 02:38:25.420]  know about 9 11 let's pull that up and the the elements of the Taliban will
[02:38:25.420 --> 02:38:30.460]  have a roast this is in the news and they will roast a cow which is really a
[02:38:30.460 --> 02:38:36.380]  delicacy and all these hill people who've never even hardly been in cities
[02:38:36.380 --> 02:38:40.380]  who raised goats for a living they come in to get the food they tie them up they
[02:38:40.380 --> 02:38:45.340]  shell them to contractors they get about $20,000 or more apiece they take the
[02:38:45.340 --> 02:38:49.500]  teenagers they torture them at camp x-ray and other camps and not just in
[02:38:49.500 --> 02:38:53.300]  Guantanamo Bay but also inside Afghanistan and a lot of them become
[02:38:53.300 --> 02:38:57.260]  double agents and get released and then get sent out to go out and set up other
[02:38:57.260 --> 02:39:02.660]  people there it is that's out of what Reuters the examiner also is reporting on
[02:39:02.660 --> 02:39:10.940]  it report 92% of Afghans don't know about 9 1 1 40% think US out to destroy
[02:39:10.940 --> 02:39:17.580]  Islam so the this is the country we're in to fight the people that carried out 9
[02:39:17.580 --> 02:39:24.540]  11 most of them and then they're not bad people they're not stupid people they
[02:39:24.540 --> 02:39:31.940]  are middle-aged I mean this is like something from 800 years ago I mean they
[02:39:31.940 --> 02:39:37.780]  don't know stuff outside their town folks I mean this is dark ages stuff here
[02:39:37.780 --> 02:39:41.940]  that's how most historians and anthropologists describe it this is the
[02:39:41.940 --> 02:39:47.740]  big enemy this is why we've got to have all these wars 92% don't know about 9
[02:39:47.740 --> 02:39:51.300]  11 they don't know their head from a hole in the ground geopolitically and
[02:39:51.300 --> 02:39:59.700]  they're taken and sold and then taken in torture so that's how these people
[02:39:59.700 --> 02:40:06.540]  operate now I want to get into the really key information right now for
[02:40:06.540 --> 02:40:13.620]  everybody on the economic front and I I know you know this but your friends and
[02:40:13.620 --> 02:40:18.100]  family may not and we have got to get this information out to them now not
[02:40:18.100 --> 02:40:22.860]  tomorrow not next week when people are talking about you know did they find
[02:40:22.860 --> 02:40:28.780]  Natalie Holloway's jaw or did they find the Easter bunnies you know necklace or
[02:40:28.780 --> 02:40:35.620]  did they find Santa Claus's hat this Thanksgiving when they're talking about
[02:40:35.620 --> 02:40:40.300]  all these things that don't matter you need to point out that private IMF
[02:40:40.300 --> 02:40:45.300]  World Bank Federal Reserve International Bank of Settlements holding companies
[02:40:45.300 --> 02:40:50.340]  admittedly are imploding the world economy by design they create the tens of
[02:40:50.340 --> 02:40:56.260]  trillions in fiat currency out of nothing they go in and lobby governments
[02:40:56.260 --> 02:41:01.060]  and even put their Goldman Sachs people in as presidents and finance ministers
[02:41:01.060 --> 02:41:05.380]  in all the countries they bring down Latin America the Mediterranean Western
[02:41:05.380 --> 02:41:10.020]  Europe Eastern Europe Asia the United States I mean it's the same players the
[02:41:10.020 --> 02:41:14.980]  economic high-level hitmen they go in and they get the governments to invest in
[02:41:14.980 --> 02:41:18.940]  derivatives and then those go under they get them to invest the pension funds in
[02:41:18.940 --> 02:41:24.980]  derivatives they get them to balloon the nanny welfare state to get a group of
[02:41:24.980 --> 02:41:28.900]  dependent people in the population addicted to government to be a political
[02:41:28.900 --> 02:41:33.700]  weapon against the middle class or any nouveau rich that understand the true
[02:41:33.700 --> 02:41:37.780]  paradigm of the ultra rich using big government to vertically integrate
[02:41:37.780 --> 02:41:43.820]  economies now you notice in Greece you'll notice in Portugal you'll notice in
[02:41:43.820 --> 02:41:47.900]  Spain you'll notice in Ireland in all these countries you'll notice in Nigeria
[02:41:47.900 --> 02:41:54.540]  in Argentina in the United States the bigger the banking bailout is the more
[02:41:54.540 --> 02:41:58.420]  debt you've got to pay in taxes the more the services get cut and then they
[02:41:58.420 --> 02:42:03.500]  come back always a year later or less and say it didn't work now you owe even
[02:42:03.500 --> 02:42:11.940]  more because the central banks created out of nothing and the Federal Reserve
[02:42:11.940 --> 02:42:16.700]  chairman the current one and the last one openly tell the news they're above
[02:42:16.700 --> 02:42:20.180]  the law and no one can investigate them and no one can look at what they're
[02:42:20.180 --> 02:42:27.620]  doing it's gotten so bad that even China now says we want to audit the Fed we
[02:42:27.620 --> 02:42:31.020]  want to know what you're doing you're devaluing the dollar worldwide it's the
[02:42:31.020 --> 02:42:36.140]  World Reserve currency and the Federal Reserve says you can't see it I mean who
[02:42:36.140 --> 02:42:39.300]  are these people well they're the private banking cartels they're the
[02:42:39.300 --> 02:42:43.780]  robber barons they're the Ponzi men that created Ponzi scheme so big they got all
[02:42:43.780 --> 02:42:47.540]  the pension funds worldwide invested in this stuff to one degree or another and
[02:42:47.540 --> 02:42:51.500]  they say we're too big to fail give us the world or it's over we want a open
[02:42:51.500 --> 02:42:56.780]  world bank that you pay private VAT and carbon taxes to this is public now and
[02:42:56.780 --> 02:43:02.180]  we'll have a global digital currency that all other currencies are based on I
[02:43:02.180 --> 02:43:07.940]  mean we've got a bunch of Ken laid Bernie made off types literally setting up
[02:43:07.940 --> 02:43:12.580]  world government over us all through completely transparent brazen total
[02:43:12.580 --> 02:43:15.980]  fraud are we going to put up with it let's look at one country in this
[02:43:15.980 --> 02:43:23.980]  constellation here's Reuters today this is by Steve Slater Ireland hoist the
[02:43:23.980 --> 02:43:27.900]  for sale sign over stricken banks what's happened to our ports our businesses
[02:43:27.900 --> 02:43:33.820]  our infrastructure our factories same thing this is economic warfare economic
[02:43:33.820 --> 02:43:39.140]  corporate conquest Ireland's banks are up for sale remember how great they were
[02:43:39.140 --> 02:43:43.340]  a year they were the EU success story who they were going to join the EU once
[02:43:43.340 --> 02:43:46.380]  they had to get him in the EU before they imploded their economy they had to
[02:43:46.380 --> 02:43:50.780]  get him under that charter under that treaty to then have EU taxpayers bail
[02:43:50.780 --> 02:43:56.660]  out Ireland which just means trillions more to the banks and then you watch in
[02:43:56.660 --> 02:44:02.740]  a year it'll be even more and until until half the public's homeless 11 years
[02:44:02.740 --> 02:44:09.100]  ago Argentina was the wealthiest country in central and South America it
[02:44:09.100 --> 02:44:12.540]  dwarfed any wealth in central and South America down there in South America a
[02:44:12.540 --> 02:44:18.580]  hundred years ago they had the term as rich as an Argentine per capita they
[02:44:18.580 --> 02:44:21.940]  were the richest people in the hemisphere they were richer than Americans
[02:44:21.940 --> 02:44:27.380]  not anymore remember that Washington Post article in 2001 about the tractor
[02:44:27.380 --> 02:44:31.260]  trailer overturning one week into the implosion and cows falling out and
[02:44:31.260 --> 02:44:36.500]  yuppies running up starving with knives slicing off raw flesh gobbling it like
[02:44:36.500 --> 02:44:41.380]  something out of a zombie movie huh because they dollar eyes because they
[02:44:41.380 --> 02:44:44.500]  took the loans because they bought the derivatives they did what the bankers
[02:44:44.500 --> 02:44:51.160]  told them it was all set up okay that's Argentine the Argentinian system
[02:44:51.160 --> 02:44:55.420]  Argentina a few years into the implosion we're not there yet it's
[02:44:55.420 --> 02:45:00.460]  coming here and I want you to know who to blame Ireland's banks are up for sale
[02:45:00.460 --> 02:45:04.180]  the country central bank chief said as the government seeks to cut them down in
[02:45:04.180 --> 02:45:08.300]  size oh see that's their fault the local banks that were run by the big
[02:45:08.300 --> 02:45:12.820]  globalist cut them down to size who will teach those local banks by giving
[02:45:12.820 --> 02:45:16.380]  them to the mega banks listen to this Ireland's banks are up for sale see
[02:45:16.380 --> 02:45:19.100]  they're not just taking over third world companies now see Ireland's banks are up
[02:45:19.100 --> 02:45:22.740]  for sale the country central bank chief said as the government seeks to cut them
[02:45:22.740 --> 02:45:26.700]  down to size after their reckless lending forced the country to seek an
[02:45:26.700 --> 02:45:31.300]  international bailout to the very same banks that run them domestically it's
[02:45:31.300 --> 02:45:36.620]  this international template of these mega banks raping everyone and you run
[02:45:36.620 --> 02:45:41.060]  out of one of their arms into their other arm and then back and forth forever
[02:45:41.060 --> 02:45:44.940]  as they get more and more wealthy and consolidate power and wage war against the
[02:45:44.940 --> 02:45:47.660]  real economy they don't like real economies they don't want you being
[02:45:47.660 --> 02:45:51.140]  independent they don't want you being local they don't want you being truly
[02:45:51.140 --> 02:45:54.620]  sustainable but they got a fake sustainability for you cutting your
[02:45:54.620 --> 02:45:58.340]  power off and calling an austerity now listen to this key quote out of Reuters
[02:45:58.340 --> 02:46:04.380]  they are for sale as far as I'm concerned said Patrick Hanahan said today I
[02:46:04.380 --> 02:46:08.420]  have been an advocate for a number of years for small countries to have foreign
[02:46:08.420 --> 02:46:12.620]  owners for their banks which then control their currency this is neo
[02:46:12.620 --> 02:46:20.260]  colonialism corporate mercantile fraud it is outrageous investigate the central
[02:46:20.260 --> 02:46:25.100]  banks indict their heads clap them in irons all of them are criminals
[02:46:25.100 --> 02:46:29.540]  Goldman Sachs makes tens of billions of bonuses that pays a 500 million dollar
[02:46:29.540 --> 02:46:34.660]  fine those are crimes they've committed arrest them they're going to destroy
[02:46:34.660 --> 02:46:41.260]  everything they're ruthless they're full of avarice these people just like you've
[02:46:41.260 --> 02:46:45.660]  had other empires Napoleon Hitler and others invading and using cannons to
[02:46:45.660 --> 02:46:52.620]  destroy things and troops they use economic control it goes on Dublin has
[02:46:52.620 --> 02:46:56.700]  already said it will intensify reform of the banks and surplus activities that
[02:46:56.700 --> 02:47:01.900]  means jack-up taxes cut benefits everything goes to the bankers so these
[02:47:01.900 --> 02:47:05.180]  guys individually can make like six seven million dollars a year and have
[02:47:05.180 --> 02:47:09.740]  giant palaces just total crooks ripping everyone off it just never ends oh
[02:47:09.740 --> 02:47:13.340]  Congress wants to know where the trillions and bailout money went they
[02:47:13.340 --> 02:47:17.900]  won't tell anybody I mean they got their federal goons sticking their hands
[02:47:17.900 --> 02:47:24.540]  down our pants is there no end to the humiliation we're on a view for a fast
[02:47:24.540 --> 02:47:27.980]  track forced disposal of our assets that's their whole infrastructure we
[02:47:27.980 --> 02:47:33.220]  will more than likely have to come at a discount for book that rate value allowing
[02:47:33.220 --> 02:47:38.220]  government indemnities in relation to future loan losses so just the whole
[02:47:38.220 --> 02:47:43.380]  country being fed into the maw of the criminal banks that induce them hey hey
[02:47:43.380 --> 02:47:48.020]  Ireland you voted no on EU entry but you went ahead and did it the second time
[02:47:48.020 --> 02:47:52.220]  and now they're going to rape you hard there's another one fresh market
[02:47:52.220 --> 02:47:57.020]  turmoil as British bank shares take pounding over fresh Irish crisis yeah
[02:47:57.020 --> 02:48:02.180]  it's going to Portugal and then Spain and then England and then France and then
[02:48:02.180 --> 02:48:05.940]  Germany and then the Netherlands and everybody's gonna get hurt by these
[02:48:05.940 --> 02:48:11.860]  bankers then they are laughing it is so funny to them you think they'll just
[02:48:11.860 --> 02:48:18.020]  kill a million Iraqis but won't hurt you you think they'll destroy the Argentinian
[02:48:18.020 --> 02:48:23.060]  economy and leave you alone you think you're safe a bunch of overweight and I
[02:48:23.060 --> 02:48:28.060]  mean that's psychically decadent TV heads who don't care you're gonna get hurt
[02:48:28.060 --> 02:48:31.420]  bad and I'm here to tell you who's gonna hurt you because hopefully when you
[02:48:31.420 --> 02:48:35.140]  finally wake up those of you out there that don't get it you'll remember that
[02:48:35.140 --> 02:48:38.460]  the paradigm was laid out for you and who the enemy is was laid out for you
[02:48:38.460 --> 02:48:43.940]  and you'll understand it look at this in bailout Spain will be the biggest
[02:48:43.940 --> 02:48:48.980]  strategist says CNBC continuing it just goes on and on and on and on and on and
[02:48:48.980 --> 02:48:53.180]  on and on and on and on and on dollar strength goes on as Korea strife boils
[02:48:53.180 --> 02:48:55.820]  Ron Paul agrees this may have been a military industrial complex state
[02:48:55.820 --> 02:49:02.740]  provocation to do that existing home sales fell more than expected CNBC but
[02:49:02.740 --> 02:49:07.740]  hey we're the recession ended a year and a half ago in June of 09 I want to
[02:49:07.740 --> 02:49:12.820]  bring Ted Anderson up briefly because gold is shot up what today how much is
[02:49:12.820 --> 02:49:18.660]  gold up today on the Korea situation Ted well gold went to 1383 1383 50 right
[02:49:18.660 --> 02:49:23.020]  now presently it's at 1376 30 it's actually a combination of what's going
[02:49:23.020 --> 02:49:26.180]  on in Europe and what's going on in Korea that's driving the marketplace right
[02:49:26.180 --> 02:49:30.580]  now people are running to safety that's what's but let's be clear gold went to
[02:49:30.580 --> 02:49:34.180]  1400 and something an all-time record went down a little bit but in the
[02:49:34.180 --> 02:49:39.100]  physical market gold and silver is sold out almost everywhere I've checked and
[02:49:39.100 --> 02:49:42.940]  made phone calls in Austin and Dallas myself what my crew told me is true
[02:49:42.940 --> 02:49:48.300]  they're sold out or there's giant premiums Ted it is that that's the way it
[02:49:48.300 --> 02:49:51.900]  is Alex there's a huge shortage out there in the marketplace especially in
[02:49:51.900 --> 02:49:56.420]  things like silver Eagles silver bars I mean there's just been so much demand
[02:49:56.420 --> 02:49:59.860]  and there's just not enough physical supply to go around so that's what you're
[02:49:59.860 --> 02:50:03.900]  seeing with that and that and that and it is it's the truth most local coin shops
[02:50:03.900 --> 02:50:09.180]  who hold small inventories have absolutely nothing it and they've just been bought
[02:50:09.180 --> 02:50:14.420]  out and then you have a day like today where gold skyrockets up to 1383 dollars
[02:50:14.420 --> 02:50:19.380]  an ounce everybody knows this Korean thing is is gonna affect the economy
[02:50:19.380 --> 02:50:22.780]  and they're all concerned about the United States dollar you're seeing this
[02:50:22.780 --> 02:50:27.260]  rush you know you like you said it's like this planned event these people know
[02:50:27.260 --> 02:50:30.340]  what's going on they know if they go in there and they metal with the the
[02:50:30.340 --> 02:50:33.380]  economy the way they do they're gonna destroy the value of the currency
[02:50:33.380 --> 02:50:37.020]  well 10 you got a lot of radio specials and people want the best deals they

[02:55:05.740 --> 02:55:10.100]  quarter they're not gonna stop doing what they're doing you think these same
[02:55:10.100 --> 02:55:13.100]  robber barons cried when they take somebody's farm when they had one
[02:55:13.100 --> 02:55:16.660]  payment left no they don't cry that's why they're in the positions they are
[02:55:16.660 --> 02:55:22.260]  they're ruthless now going back to Ted Anderson Ted I think it's time for folks
[02:55:22.260 --> 02:55:25.140]  to get into golden silver but they already know that you really do have
[02:55:25.140 --> 02:55:29.140]  smoking good deals you know me your regular prices are excellent but these
[02:55:29.140 --> 02:55:32.780]  radio specials are your lost leaders tell folks about some of the different
[02:55:32.780 --> 02:55:37.620]  offers you have today well $97 for your three videos and three silver dollars

[02:55:55.100 --> 02:55:58.500]  I've checked on the internet prices I've already went up there walking Liberty
[02:55:58.500 --> 02:56:02.580]  halves $1284 what a great way to get silver I mean this is the silver that
[02:56:02.580 --> 02:56:07.380]  was meant for us to use in in our own Constitution you know it just it doesn't
[02:56:07.380 --> 02:56:11.340]  make sense that we're getting this fiat money it's causing problems it's just
[02:56:11.340 --> 02:56:14.180]  you know it's everything that you described I mean what a great show you
[02:56:14.180 --> 02:56:17.720]  had today with the guests you've had I mean it's just awesome to see what's
[02:56:17.720 --> 02:56:21.380]  going on here but people do need to get involved with gold and silver there's no
[02:56:21.380 --> 02:56:26.100]  question about it because paper currency is not gonna hold value especially when
[02:56:26.100 --> 02:56:29.660]  the printing press is on like it is just crazy that people would think that
[02:56:29.660 --> 02:56:33.900]  they're better off with stocks bonds mutual funds I mean you name it I
[02:56:33.900 --> 02:56:38.540]  annuity is just so many different types of paper type investments and it's all
[02:56:38.540 --> 02:56:43.540]  being manipulated by this printing press and and the Federal Reserve Bank and
[02:56:43.540 --> 02:56:48.060]  all the international banks and at wars with the Korea I mean that everything
[02:56:48.060 --> 02:56:51.340]  is being stacked against it I don't know why people wouldn't get involved with
[02:56:51.340 --> 02:56:54.540]  gold and silver but take advantage you want to get to know who might it says
[02:56:54.540 --> 02:57:00.020]  $97 will buy you three silver dollars you get to have three of Alex's original
