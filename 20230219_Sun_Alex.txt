[00:00.000 --> 00:19.000]  Infowars, tomorrow's news, today.
[01:00.000 --> 01:26.000]  It's Sunday, February 19th, 2023.
[01:26.000 --> 01:30.000]  I'm your host Alex Jones, I'll be here for the next two hours.
[01:30.000 --> 01:34.000]  I know Troy has a very special broadcast with three guests,
[01:34.000 --> 01:37.000]  joining him on a host of topics including the big anti-war,
[01:37.000 --> 01:42.000]  bipartisan demonstrations at DC, the ongoing disaster,
[01:42.000 --> 01:50.000]  unfolding in Ohio and the train derailment.
[01:50.000 --> 01:56.000]  I'm going to be covering World War III that has already begun.
[01:56.000 --> 01:59.000]  I want to thank you all for joining us.
[01:59.000 --> 02:05.000]  Everything we witness by the ruling globalist is an attempt
[02:05.000 --> 02:09.000]  to demoralize us and break our will and condition us
[02:09.000 --> 02:16.000]  to accept successive increases in horror and to give up hope,
[02:16.000 --> 02:18.000]  but we cannot do that.
[02:18.000 --> 02:20.000]  I saw this clip this morning and I thought,
[02:20.000 --> 02:23.000]  surely it's out of context and it's not.
[02:23.000 --> 02:27.000]  I have the transcript here where he says,
[02:27.000 --> 02:29.000]  why don't we just start eating babies?
[02:29.000 --> 02:33.000]  We've got all this extra baby parts, millions we kill every year.
[02:33.000 --> 02:35.000]  Why don't we just eat them?
[02:35.000 --> 02:38.000]  So that's the next evolution and you will eat the bugs
[02:38.000 --> 02:42.000]  as you will eat the dead babies.
[02:42.000 --> 02:47.000]  The example I often use is if we want to get to ethical bedrock,
[02:47.000 --> 02:52.000]  we should be able to say things like, why can't we eat babies?
[02:52.000 --> 02:54.000]  There are sometimes extra babies in the world.
[02:54.000 --> 02:56.000]  They're full of protein.
[02:56.000 --> 02:57.000]  Can't we eat them?
[02:57.000 --> 02:59.000]  It's not a conversation about eating babies.
[02:59.000 --> 03:03.000]  It's a conversation about how you can close the door to this idea
[03:03.000 --> 03:07.000]  that we both recognize as repellent and well,
[03:07.000 --> 03:10.000]  we recognize that it's the way.
[03:10.000 --> 03:12.000]  There are people out there who will say,
[03:12.000 --> 03:17.000]  hey, Sam Harris is a guy who wonders, can we eat babies?
[03:17.000 --> 03:22.000]  But isn't that what this whole system is?
[03:22.000 --> 03:24.000]  It's a system where we don't value others around us.
[03:24.000 --> 03:27.000]  We don't value ourselves and we don't stand up for others.
[03:27.000 --> 03:31.000]  Nobody stands up for us and then we're isolated,
[03:31.000 --> 03:34.000]  atomized, alone individuals that this predatory system
[03:34.000 --> 03:37.000]  can have its way with.
[03:37.000 --> 03:39.000]  And that's what the New World Order is setting up.
[03:39.000 --> 03:42.000]  Here's a short clip of us seeing Harris on the young turds
[03:42.000 --> 03:45.000]  talking about eating the babies.
[03:45.000 --> 03:46.000]  You know, why can't we eat babies?
[03:46.000 --> 03:47.000]  What's wrong with eating babies?
[03:47.000 --> 03:49.000]  If we've got extra babies around that nobody wants,
[03:49.000 --> 03:51.000]  why can't we eat them?
[03:51.000 --> 03:55.000]  And then he goes on as I read you the full quote.
[03:55.000 --> 03:56.000]  Extra babies.
[03:56.000 --> 03:58.000]  Remember when I sat on Joe Rogan like four years ago?
[03:58.000 --> 04:02.000]  The governor of Virginia at the time said,
[04:02.000 --> 04:06.000]  we're going to get rid of the baby after they're born.
[04:06.000 --> 04:11.000]  And I made the satirical line that,
[04:11.000 --> 04:16.000]  why are we wasting seven pounds of meat?
[04:16.000 --> 04:18.000]  But they are using every part of the baby
[04:18.000 --> 04:21.000]  for medical experiments and for the medical industry.
[04:21.000 --> 04:27.000]  And when we allow ourselves to be defiled and degraded like that,
[04:27.000 --> 04:29.000]  we're made the image of God.
[04:29.000 --> 04:33.000]  And we allow these sick abortionists to do horrible things
[04:33.000 --> 04:37.000]  to the dead and dying babies even after they're out of the womb.
[04:37.000 --> 04:40.000]  We all die inside.
[04:40.000 --> 04:43.000]  All right, we got a hell of a broadcast lined up.
[04:43.000 --> 04:47.000]  I had prepared a lot yesterday and a lot today.
[04:47.000 --> 04:50.000]  And so this is going to be a broadcast you're not going to want to miss
[04:50.000 --> 04:53.000]  because we have to face the full horror
[04:53.000 --> 04:55.000]  and not make a friend of that horror
[04:55.000 --> 04:57.000]  but make an enemy of that horror to defeat it.
[04:57.000 --> 05:01.000]  Stay with us.
[05:01.000 --> 05:05.000]  I talk a lot about the great successes Info Wars has had.
[05:05.000 --> 05:07.000]  I don't think anybody can deny it.
[05:07.000 --> 05:11.000]  And it is because of Lister's viewers supporting us.
[05:11.000 --> 05:13.000]  When we talk about the crew at Info Wars,
[05:13.000 --> 05:16.000]  people behind the scenes, the researchers, the writers,
[05:16.000 --> 05:20.000]  they really have been the MVPs in this fight.
[05:20.000 --> 05:22.000]  And we look at Harrison Smith and Owen Schreuer
[05:22.000 --> 05:24.000]  and the hard work they engage in every day,
[05:24.000 --> 05:27.000]  five, six, seven days a week.
[05:27.000 --> 05:29.000]  It's really just incredible.
[05:29.000 --> 05:32.000]  For myself, the whole Info Wars crew, I thank you for your past support.
[05:32.000 --> 05:35.000]  I only encourage you now to realize that Info Wars
[05:35.000 --> 05:38.000]  cannot stay on air if you do not support us.
[05:38.000 --> 05:40.000]  I know you spread the word, I know you pray for us,
[05:40.000 --> 05:42.000]  and that's wonderful, keep doing it.
[05:42.000 --> 05:45.000]  But most viewers and listeners never go to InfoWarsTour.com
[05:45.000 --> 05:48.000]  and you never buy great products that enrich and empower your life
[05:48.000 --> 05:50.000]  all at the same time, keep us on air.
[05:50.000 --> 05:52.000]  I know that less than one percent of our listeners
[05:52.000 --> 05:54.000]  actually go buy products at InfoWarsTour.com.
[05:54.000 --> 05:56.000]  If just one percent more of you took action
[05:56.000 --> 05:59.000]  and went to InfoWarsTour.com, our funding problems will be over.
[05:59.000 --> 06:28.000]  Please take action now.
[06:29.000 --> 06:37.000]  It's Sunday, February 19th, 2023.
[06:37.000 --> 06:39.000]  We're alive.
[06:39.000 --> 06:42.000]  Defiance of the enemy's attempts to silence us.
[06:42.000 --> 06:45.000]  We're here because of you, the viewers and listeners,
[06:45.000 --> 06:47.000]  your great support and your will.
[06:47.000 --> 06:50.000]  And I salute you and I thank you.
[06:50.000 --> 06:52.000]  I have to cover all this tonight
[06:52.000 --> 06:55.000]  and we have an amazing guest, Chris Sky, joining us the second hour.
[06:55.000 --> 06:57.000]  So I'm going to try to be as calm as possible
[06:57.000 --> 07:00.000]  and at least get through the headlines on this
[07:00.000 --> 07:03.000]  and dig into quite a few of these stories in depth.
[07:03.000 --> 07:07.000]  We have a large World War III escalation of stacks,
[07:07.000 --> 07:10.000]  four stacks, dealing with that.
[07:10.000 --> 07:12.000]  I'll hit that first.
[07:12.000 --> 07:16.000]  And we have a massive stack on the mainlining of woke culture
[07:16.000 --> 07:20.000]  and the main pillars of it being pedophilia and race war.
[07:20.000 --> 07:25.000]  So we're going to be looking at that in great detail.
[07:25.000 --> 07:28.000]  Also, I came across a compilation
[07:28.000 --> 07:30.000]  of the government blowing up Building 7.
[07:30.000 --> 07:34.000]  And I haven't talked about this very much in the recent years.
[07:34.000 --> 07:39.000]  I thought we'd go back to the smoking gun of 9-11 being an inside job.
[07:39.000 --> 07:42.000]  That is coming up.
[07:42.000 --> 07:45.000]  Also, the Gateway Pundit has the same sources I have
[07:45.000 --> 07:48.000]  and they've done a better job than anybody
[07:48.000 --> 07:50.000]  when it comes to exposing January 6th
[07:50.000 --> 07:53.000]  and how that was a false flag setup.
[07:53.000 --> 07:55.000]  I have sources inside the trial,
[07:55.000 --> 07:58.000]  but obviously they'll be disbarred or arrested
[07:58.000 --> 08:01.000]  if they are known, the information they've given me.
[08:01.000 --> 08:03.000]  We've mentioned a lot of it, we've talked about it,
[08:03.000 --> 08:05.000]  but the Gateway Pundit's done a great job
[08:05.000 --> 08:07.000]  really covering it at nauseam every detail.
[08:07.000 --> 08:10.000]  15 facts on the dozens of federal operatives
[08:10.000 --> 08:12.000]  who infiltrated the Trump crowds on January 6th
[08:12.000 --> 08:15.000]  at the U.S. Capitol and led the attack.
[08:15.000 --> 08:18.000]  I'm going to ask Jim Hoff to come on sometime this week
[08:18.000 --> 08:20.000]  and cover this, but I know he has the same sources
[08:20.000 --> 08:22.000]  because I've talked to him
[08:22.000 --> 08:24.000]  and this other national talk show host,
[08:24.000 --> 08:26.000]  I'm told they're working on it, but it's incredible.
[08:26.000 --> 08:28.000]  It's come out in the trial,
[08:28.000 --> 08:31.000]  but they kicked the jury and the media out during this
[08:31.000 --> 08:33.000]  that the judge knows the feds ran the attack
[08:33.000 --> 08:35.000]  and they know all the specifics.
[08:35.000 --> 08:37.000]  And the federal informants inside the Proud Boys
[08:37.000 --> 08:39.000]  and inside the health keepers told them
[08:39.000 --> 08:41.000]  there was no plan to attack the Capitol,
[08:41.000 --> 08:43.000]  but that's not allowed in front of the jury.
[08:43.000 --> 08:47.000]  So next level injustice, weaponized courts,
[08:47.000 --> 08:49.000]  that's just one stack.
[08:49.000 --> 08:54.000]  Huge vaccine news, mainstream top German newspapers,
[08:54.000 --> 08:57.000]  top British newspapers and major U.S. publications
[08:57.000 --> 09:00.000]  are reporting what Robert F. Kennedy Jr.
[09:00.000 --> 09:03.000]  and Robert Barnes told you here a year and a half ago
[09:03.000 --> 09:06.000]  that they faked the first little initial trials.
[09:06.000 --> 09:08.000]  They didn't do pretrials they told the public about.
[09:08.000 --> 09:11.000]  They actually did on rats. They killed a bunch of them.
[09:11.000 --> 09:15.000]  But they then did some fake trials,
[09:15.000 --> 09:17.000]  field trials during the rollout.
[09:17.000 --> 09:19.000]  Now two years ago.
[09:19.000 --> 09:23.000]  And now mainstream media is reporting that they covered that up.
[09:23.000 --> 09:27.000]  So that's an incredible stack of news on that front.
[09:27.000 --> 09:30.000]  Also thousands protesting against World Economic Forum
[09:30.000 --> 09:33.000]  backed 15-minute cities that turned quadrants
[09:33.000 --> 09:35.000]  of every town and city into prisons
[09:35.000 --> 09:38.000]  and break them up into subsections.
[09:38.000 --> 09:40.000]  I told you all about that in my film Endgame
[09:40.000 --> 09:42.000]  because it was in the blueprint then.
[09:42.000 --> 09:44.000]  But now they're going operational.
[09:44.000 --> 09:47.000]  They just announced 15-minute cities a month ago in England
[09:47.000 --> 09:50.000]  since then, Germany, France, liberal leftist areas in the U.S.,
[09:50.000 --> 09:52.000]  Canada, Australia, New Zealand.
[09:52.000 --> 09:54.000]  They've all announced it.
[09:54.000 --> 09:56.000]  And somebody found a clip of Nancy Pelosi,
[09:56.000 --> 10:00.000]  I've never seen this clip, in 92
[10:00.000 --> 10:03.000]  admitting to the whole Agenda 21 takeover plan.
[10:03.000 --> 10:07.000]  So we'll be playing that as well.
[10:07.000 --> 10:12.000]  We are also going to get to the Catholic Bishop in Los Angeles
[10:12.000 --> 10:14.000]  who lived in a modest home,
[10:14.000 --> 10:17.000]  murdered, shot in the chest today and killed.
[10:17.000 --> 10:20.000]  And that just adds into all the crime statistics off the charts.
[10:20.000 --> 10:28.000]  But if you live in Chicago or LA or San Francisco
[10:28.000 --> 10:32.000]  or hell even Houston now, you are crazy.
[10:32.000 --> 10:34.000]  And Austin used to be a very safe town.
[10:34.000 --> 10:36.000]  It is dangerous as hell.
[10:36.000 --> 10:38.000]  And I don't tell my wife what to do.
[10:38.000 --> 10:39.000]  I don't boss her around.
[10:39.000 --> 10:43.000]  But I told her, you don't go get your nails done downtown anymore.
[10:43.000 --> 10:45.000]  You don't go meet your friends for lunch down there anymore.
[10:45.000 --> 10:48.000]  And if I find out about it, there's going to be big problems.
[10:48.000 --> 10:52.000]  Because so many of her friends and people have been mugged,
[10:52.000 --> 10:54.000]  shaken down, you name it.
[10:54.000 --> 10:56.000]  I mean, just where I live, they literally,
[10:56.000 --> 10:59.000]  just last night, Savannah Hernandez shot footage of it in Austin.
[10:59.000 --> 11:01.000]  There was a big brawl broke out.
[11:01.000 --> 11:03.000]  The police tried to pull up and do something about it.
[11:03.000 --> 11:08.000]  And so a giant crowd of over 1,000 people chased the police down.
[11:08.000 --> 11:10.000]  And the police turned and fled.
[11:10.000 --> 11:13.000]  So, I mean, it's just, it's all totally over the top.
[11:13.000 --> 11:16.000]  The designed breakdown of society.
[11:16.000 --> 11:21.000]  Also, I've been giving Elon Musk, not a pass,
[11:21.000 --> 11:26.000]  but I've had my judgment on hold while I collate and cogitate
[11:26.000 --> 11:29.000]  and try to see what he's really doing over there at Twitter.
[11:29.000 --> 11:30.000]  I like a lot of the things he's doing.
[11:30.000 --> 11:32.000]  I just like some of the things he's doing.
[11:32.000 --> 11:34.000]  Obviously, he hasn't brought me back and said some terrible things
[11:34.000 --> 11:35.000]  about me that weren't true.
[11:35.000 --> 11:37.000]  But I get on the sacrificial lambs.
[11:37.000 --> 11:38.000]  Everybody else can come back.
[11:38.000 --> 11:40.000]  But Alex Jones is still the bad guy.
[11:40.000 --> 11:44.000]  But a couple of months into this, Twitter files,
[11:44.000 --> 11:46.000]  what are we, two and a half months in,
[11:46.000 --> 11:48.000]  they've done now the 16th drop.
[11:48.000 --> 11:50.000]  So they did the first drops real quick.
[11:50.000 --> 11:55.000]  Now Matt Taidi, that's the gatekeeper over at Rolling Stone,
[11:55.000 --> 11:56.000]  it's a trickle now.
[11:56.000 --> 11:59.000]  And I was thinking, why don't you release all of it?
[11:59.000 --> 12:02.000]  Or large sections, not just select groups.
[12:02.000 --> 12:07.000]  So they were mean, U.S. senators wanted zero hedge censored and controlled.
[12:07.000 --> 12:10.000]  Well, we know that, and it's wrong what happened to zero hedge.
[12:10.000 --> 12:14.000]  But what about the Alex Jones files?
[12:14.000 --> 12:16.000]  And I know they haven't released all the Trump files.
[12:16.000 --> 12:18.000]  Or where's the Fauci files?
[12:18.000 --> 12:20.000]  We heard a month ago, five weeks ago,
[12:20.000 --> 12:22.000]  he was going to release it in a week.
[12:22.000 --> 12:24.000]  Never did it.
[12:24.000 --> 12:28.000]  So I'm getting to some serious issues here with old Elon Musk
[12:28.000 --> 12:29.000]  and what's going on.
[12:29.000 --> 12:32.000]  Is he just blackmailing the power structure to leave Malone,
[12:32.000 --> 12:37.000]  regulatory, with his SpaceX and his brain ship company
[12:37.000 --> 12:42.000]  and his self-driving car company and all the rest of it?
[12:42.000 --> 12:46.000]  I mean, is that what this is really, really all about?
[12:46.000 --> 12:50.000]  So we're going to be looking at that as well.
[12:50.000 --> 12:53.000]  There is a lot to cover.
[12:53.000 --> 12:56.000]  They've had a former MSNBC host come out and say that
[12:56.000 --> 12:59.000]  they were not allowed to say one bad thing about a Democrat
[12:59.000 --> 13:00.000]  and they were threatened to be fired.
[13:00.000 --> 13:02.000]  We don't really need whistleblowers to tell us that.
[13:02.000 --> 13:04.000]  We already know that, but there's an article.
[13:04.000 --> 13:07.000]  Several articles on that and big interviews have come out as well.
[13:07.000 --> 13:10.000]  So I'm glad that information is starting to come out,
[13:10.000 --> 13:13.000]  but it's kind of like telling us water is wet and the sky is blue
[13:13.000 --> 13:17.000]  and ducks like to paddle around at the park in the pond.
[13:17.000 --> 13:21.000]  So we're going to be looking at all of that and more today.
[13:21.000 --> 13:27.000]  Also, there is a lot of anti-second amendment information going on.
[13:27.000 --> 13:29.000]  The ATF, and I've already seen this happening on the ground,
[13:29.000 --> 13:34.000]  but a big ATF directive from Biden got leaked last week
[13:34.000 --> 13:37.000]  and it says they have a plan to shut down most gun shops in the country
[13:37.000 --> 13:40.000]  by using regulations that if one eye is dotted incorrectly
[13:40.000 --> 13:44.000]  or one T, literally, in any other paperwork going back
[13:44.000 --> 13:49.000]  in some cases, decades, they will be shut down.
[13:49.000 --> 13:53.000]  So white glove inspections for the gun shops,
[13:53.000 --> 13:56.000]  an in-run around the Constitution.
[13:56.000 --> 13:59.000]  Also this CNBC headline,
[13:59.000 --> 14:02.000]  brain implant startup backed by Bezos Gates
[14:02.000 --> 14:07.000]  is testing mind-controlled computing on humans.
[14:07.000 --> 14:11.000]  Trump slams Biden over East Palestine.
[14:11.000 --> 14:15.000]  As soon as I announced I'm going, he announced a team will go.
[14:15.000 --> 14:19.000]  Yeah, Biden was ignoring and refusing even federal aid,
[14:19.000 --> 14:22.000]  which is outrageous, until Trump said he was going
[14:22.000 --> 14:25.000]  and he's still refusing federal aid.
[14:25.000 --> 14:31.000]  So we're going to hit all of this and more one way or another today.
[14:31.000 --> 14:33.000]  Please remember, we cannot run this show
[14:33.000 --> 14:37.000]  or fund this critical operation that reaches millions of people a day without you.
[14:37.000 --> 14:40.000]  And I appreciate all the work you do buying great products
[14:40.000 --> 14:42.000]  at info.org.com that enrich your life
[14:42.000 --> 14:45.000]  and is spreading the word about the broadcast and praying for us.
[14:45.000 --> 14:48.000]  All three are critical and essential and paramount.
[14:48.000 --> 14:51.000]  We have a lot of great products and a lot of great products that have been sold out
[14:51.000 --> 14:53.000]  for in one case over a year, another case over two years,
[14:53.000 --> 14:57.000]  because we wouldn't cut the quality during the lockdowns, supply chain breakdown.
[14:57.000 --> 15:01.000]  But ultimate bone broth is really a fantastic product, is back in stock,
[15:01.000 --> 15:06.000]  and so is our prebiotic, not probiotic, prebiotic formula
[15:06.000 --> 15:09.000]  that I really miss that does incredible things for gut health,
[15:09.000 --> 15:14.000]  helps reduce a key type of amino acid that's anti-cancer,
[15:14.000 --> 15:16.000]  so much more in the gut.
[15:16.000 --> 15:19.000]  You really owe it to yourself, the highest quality product for gut health.
[15:19.000 --> 15:23.000]  And so that product is also back in product,
[15:23.000 --> 15:28.000]  our gut prebiotic is back in stock, also Brainforce Plus and Brainforce Ultra,
[15:28.000 --> 15:32.000]  two different but equally powerful and amazing.
[15:32.000 --> 15:37.000]  Neutropic natural brain boosters are back in stock in there, 50% off.
[15:37.000 --> 15:40.000]  Physic Magnesium's back in stock has both the good types of magnesium,
[15:40.000 --> 15:43.000]  nobody else has that, but it's going to sell out soon,
[15:43.000 --> 15:45.000]  very limited quantity of that, so we have the Physic Magnesium.
[15:45.000 --> 15:47.000]  It's all there at infowarstore.com.
[15:47.000 --> 15:50.000]  Please take action and get great products,
[15:50.000 --> 15:53.000]  we're keeping this on the air at infowarstore.com.
[15:53.000 --> 15:58.000]  We'll be right back with World War III news as Biden goes to Europe.
[15:58.000 --> 16:01.000]  Well, I have fantastic stuff.
[16:01.000 --> 16:04.000]  Diet force? Diet force is amazing.
[16:04.000 --> 16:07.000]  I'm 45 and I have bits.
[16:07.000 --> 16:10.000]  I go to the gym and I have bits that won't move.
[16:10.000 --> 16:14.000]  And diet force has helped me move those bits.
[16:14.000 --> 16:19.000]  Under my pecs, my belly, I'm just taking diet force two tablets a day.
[16:19.000 --> 16:25.000]  Man, if you're struggling to get chip shaped for the ladies,
[16:25.000 --> 16:27.000]  diet force is the go.
[16:27.000 --> 16:30.000]  You have to get the diet force and have it to a day.
[16:30.000 --> 16:32.000]  And just keep acting.
[16:32.000 --> 16:35.000]  Infowarsstore.com, X7 diet force.
[16:35.000 --> 16:38.000]  Infowarsstore.com, baby.
[16:38.000 --> 16:40.000]  Now on sale, we're cutting that out.
[16:40.000 --> 16:42.000]  We're cutting that call into an ad, I can guarantee you that.
[16:42.000 --> 16:44.000]  Thank you so much for the call, Grant.
[16:44.000 --> 16:46.000]  God bless Australia.
[16:46.000 --> 16:48.000]  We'll be right back, folks, don't go anywhere.
[16:48.000 --> 17:03.000]  Infowarsstore.com, diet force, get it now.
[17:18.000 --> 17:26.000]  I need all of you to stay indoors for the next 15 days to flatten the can.
[17:26.000 --> 17:34.000]  I also need you to wear masks and I also need you to only shop at mega corporations.
[17:34.000 --> 17:40.000]  That way we can consolidate control and bankrupt the world economy,
[17:40.000 --> 17:45.000]  leaving companies that only I own profitable.
[17:45.000 --> 17:49.000]  You will then be my slave, my own.
[17:49.000 --> 17:53.000]  And then you get that special shot of freedom from copra,
[17:53.000 --> 17:55.000]  will remove your immune system,
[17:55.000 --> 18:00.000]  so you'll be dependent on me for the rest of your miserable lives.
[18:00.000 --> 18:02.000]  If you go to onlinehealthnow.com,
[18:02.000 --> 18:06.000]  connect with trusted and unbiased doctors at the wellness company.
[18:06.000 --> 18:10.000]  And I tell you, I'm honored to be the chief scientific officer of the company.
[18:10.000 --> 18:14.000]  I contribute with like so many else do there, so many wonderful doctors.
[18:14.000 --> 18:19.000]  Far and away, the most popular product is Dr. Vandewater's detoxification supplement
[18:19.000 --> 18:21.000]  that features natokinase.
[18:21.000 --> 18:23.000]  It's a natural proteolytic enzyme.
[18:23.000 --> 18:29.000]  This one is the only enzyme that we're aware of right now that dissolves the spike protein.
[18:29.000 --> 18:30.000]  This is very important.
[18:30.000 --> 18:33.000]  The spike protein is loaded in the body with the COVID-19 infection
[18:33.000 --> 18:35.000]  and definitely with the vaccines.
[18:35.000 --> 18:36.000]  People are low with the spike protein.
[18:36.000 --> 18:37.000]  They don't feel well.
[18:37.000 --> 18:39.000]  This is a potential solution.
[18:39.000 --> 18:42.000]  Hydroxychloroquine comes from a natural substance.
[18:42.000 --> 18:45.000]  So does ivermectin and now natokinase.
[18:45.000 --> 18:46.000]  Isn't it interesting?
[18:46.000 --> 18:52.000]  Natural substances in a sense combating this man-made disaster, SARS-CoV-2 in the vaccines.
[18:52.000 --> 18:55.000]  Onlinehealthnow.com, thank you for your support.
[18:55.000 --> 18:57.000]  And thank you for getting into that because it's important.
[18:57.000 --> 19:23.000]  You didn't come here to do that, but I made you do it.
[19:27.000 --> 19:56.000]  Thank you so much for your support.
[19:56.000 --> 20:22.000]  Thank you very much.
[20:22.000 --> 20:49.000]  Thank you very much.
[20:49.000 --> 21:15.000]  Thank you very much.
[21:20.000 --> 21:24.000]  All right.
[21:24.000 --> 21:31.000]  Well, the clown in chief is now making his way to the Air Force One to Europe.
[21:31.000 --> 21:41.000]  Kamala Harris, the junior clown, the vice clown, says Russia has committed crimes against humanity in Ukraine.
[21:41.000 --> 21:44.000]  Well, maybe so, but starting the war was a crime against humanity
[21:44.000 --> 21:47.000]  and so was pushing a deadly shot on the public.
[21:47.000 --> 21:52.000]  Here is Kamala Harris, the clown from Europe.
[21:52.000 --> 21:56.000]  And there is no doubt.
[21:56.000 --> 22:03.000]  These are crimes against humanity.
[22:03.000 --> 22:05.000]  What a joke.
[22:05.000 --> 22:08.000]  What an empty suit.
[22:08.000 --> 22:11.000]  My God, she's got the charisma of a librarian.
[22:11.000 --> 22:23.000]  The United States has formally determined that Russia has committed crimes against humanity.
[22:23.000 --> 22:38.000]  And I say to all those who have perpetrated these crimes and to their superiors who are complicit in these crimes,
[22:38.000 --> 22:46.000]  you will be held to account.
[22:46.000 --> 22:56.000]  In the face of these indisputable facts to all of us here in Munich,
[22:56.000 --> 23:03.000]  let us renew our commitment to accountability.
[23:03.000 --> 23:13.000]  Let us renew our commitment to the rule of law.
[23:13.000 --> 23:19.000]  As we escalate straight into World War III, wow.
[23:19.000 --> 23:23.000]  One of the decisive moments of its presidency,
[23:23.000 --> 23:25.000]  Biden heads to troubled Europe.
[23:25.000 --> 23:29.000]  Troubled is putting it lightly.
[23:29.000 --> 23:33.000]  It's the end of the world as we know it and Munich feels nervous.
[23:33.000 --> 23:36.000]  Germany's really concerned, Politico says.
[23:36.000 --> 23:40.000]  With Ukraine war at its doorstep, Poland becomes the West firebrand,
[23:40.000 --> 23:46.000]  the main base for all the weapons factories and training.
[23:46.000 --> 23:48.000]  Senator McConnell is not America first.
[23:48.000 --> 23:52.000]  He's working with Senate leader Chuck Schumer pushing Ukraine war
[23:52.000 --> 23:56.000]  while ignoring the destruction of America at home.
[23:56.000 --> 24:03.000]  20,000 protesters march for peace in Munich to protest Kamala Harris's Ukraine war.
[24:03.000 --> 24:12.000]  Putin launches large scale exercises of strategic nuclear forces on the eve of Joe Biden's trip to Europe.
[24:12.000 --> 24:14.000]  There's another interview that's on infowars.com.
[24:14.000 --> 24:17.000]  I'm not going to torture you with it unless you want to watch it.
[24:17.000 --> 24:23.000]  Andrea Mitchell, blank stares, says it all at Kamala Harris butcher's interview with word salad.
[24:23.000 --> 24:27.000]  I mean, it's literally scrambled information.
[24:27.000 --> 24:32.000]  It's been reported out of Austria.
[24:32.000 --> 24:36.000]  Generals have reported that there's over 20,000 NATO soldiers now fighting.
[24:36.000 --> 24:38.000]  Well, that's actually all admitted.
[24:38.000 --> 24:47.000]  We've got more videos of the Ukrainian troops hailing Hitler and doing the Nazi salute.
[24:47.000 --> 24:50.000]  Half of Ukraine was Nazi in World War II.
[24:50.000 --> 24:56.000]  I spent a lot of time this weekend watching Russian and Ukrainian trophy videos,
[24:56.000 --> 25:02.000]  and boy, to see Chinese made drones bought by the U.S. and given to Ukraine
[25:02.000 --> 25:09.000]  that have been broken, jail broke, where they don't have the geofencing in them,
[25:09.000 --> 25:15.000]  dropping hand grenades into tanks, open ports, into troops,
[25:15.000 --> 25:21.000]  huddling in artillery craters.
[25:21.000 --> 25:26.000]  It's very, very dystopic to say the least.
[25:26.000 --> 25:30.000]  Watch hundreds of these videos, hundreds of them,
[25:30.000 --> 25:36.000]  and both sides are just slaughtering each other.
[25:36.000 --> 25:39.000]  Young men and old men all being fed into a meat grinder.
[25:39.000 --> 25:41.000]  All started by George Soros.
[25:41.000 --> 25:46.000]  It's all put into motion by the globalists bragging about it on CNN years ago
[25:46.000 --> 25:49.000]  that they were starting a proxy war and that Putin's taking the bait,
[25:49.000 --> 25:52.000]  and then Putin takes the bait.
[25:52.000 --> 25:57.000]  And now we're off to the races, ladies and gentlemen.
[25:57.000 --> 26:01.000]  All sorts of explosions in Moscow, key government buildings and facilities.
[26:01.000 --> 26:05.000]  Ukraine's been taking credit for that.
[26:05.000 --> 26:08.000]  Lots of footage of young men being grabbed up the streets in Kiev
[26:08.000 --> 26:14.000]  and drug off press ganged into military service.
[26:14.000 --> 26:16.000]  And it just goes on and on and on.
[26:16.000 --> 26:19.000]  Here's one of the drones the Ukrainians bragged they were using.
[26:19.000 --> 26:24.000]  It cost $1,749. We have one here in Info Wars.
[26:24.000 --> 26:28.000]  And then they just hang a few hand grenades to it,
[26:28.000 --> 26:30.000]  and it goes in and drops them on them.
[26:30.000 --> 26:36.000]  That's the Skynet, Skynet war that's happening.
[26:36.000 --> 26:40.000]  Stalin and Iran the last month happened again a few days ago.
[26:40.000 --> 26:44.000]  They're having some of their key military facilities blown up by Israeli drones.
[26:44.000 --> 26:49.000]  So as you can see, this war has escalated extremely fast.
[26:49.000 --> 26:52.000]  There's more footage we came in from the break with.
[26:52.000 --> 26:59.000]  A train coming out of Poland carrying a whole bunch of Abrams M1A1 frontline battle tanks.
[26:59.000 --> 27:05.000]  So this is what the escalation into World War III against a nuclear.
[27:05.000 --> 27:11.000]  Power.
[27:11.000 --> 27:13.000]  Looks like.
[27:13.000 --> 27:15.000]  And it's hurting the European economy.
[27:15.000 --> 27:17.000]  It's hurting the American economy.
[27:17.000 --> 27:20.000]  It's hurting economies around the world.
[27:20.000 --> 27:24.000]  But still we barrel headlong into thermal nuclear war.
[27:24.000 --> 27:27.000]  And most analysts agree that's exactly where it's going to lead
[27:27.000 --> 27:29.000]  if it isn't the escalated quickly.
[27:29.000 --> 27:32.000]  It's surreal to me to stop here calmly talking about it.
[27:32.000 --> 27:35.000]  The right wing issue shouldn't be a left wing issue.
[27:35.000 --> 27:39.000]  It should be a common sense issue.
[27:39.000 --> 27:46.000]  Hunter linked to Russian oligarch who was involved in former FBI incident.
[27:46.000 --> 27:52.000]  They now have the FBI high level counter espionage head arrested being involved.
[27:52.000 --> 27:57.000]  So we are thoroughly penetrated by the Russians and the Chinese and so many others.
[27:57.000 --> 27:59.000]  It is just a complete mess.
[27:59.000 --> 28:03.000]  Betting on Ukraine victory with suicidal Seymour Hersh is an article on info wars.com
[28:03.000 --> 28:09.000]  where he just explains that because of corruption on both sides it's going to go on basically just escalate.
[28:09.000 --> 28:11.000]  And that the Russians historically are not going to give up.
[28:11.000 --> 28:13.000]  So it's going to get worse and worse and worse.
[28:13.000 --> 28:17.000]  And now the Russians have put their hypersonic missile production into high gear
[28:17.000 --> 28:20.000]  where they're producing over a hundred of them a day.
[28:20.000 --> 28:22.000]  These missiles go Mach 9.
[28:22.000 --> 28:23.000]  Nothing can shoot them down.
[28:23.000 --> 28:26.000]  The U.S. has systems that go Mach 20 by the way.
[28:26.000 --> 28:28.000]  But nothing can shoot them down.
[28:28.000 --> 28:34.000]  They're normally nuclear tipped but these are being filled with 500 pounds of plastic explosive.
[28:34.000 --> 28:38.000]  And so that's now what they're going to start raining down on Ukraine.
[28:38.000 --> 28:41.000]  Putin has even started using the high tech stuff yet.
[28:41.000 --> 28:46.000]  This situation is completely and totally out of control.
[28:46.000 --> 28:49.000]  Meanwhile Iran can fuel several atomic bombs.
[28:49.000 --> 28:51.000]  UN official says I agree with that.
[28:51.000 --> 28:55.000]  So it's looking a lot like World War 3.
[28:55.000 --> 28:58.000]  We're going to come back with critical information straight ahead. Please stay with us.
[29:26.000 --> 29:27.000]  The list goes on and on.

[30:08.000 --> 30:09.000]  I'm going to do that right now.
[30:09.000 --> 30:13.000]  Alex Jones has helped so many people in this industry.
[30:13.000 --> 30:18.000]  You guys have no idea how many people have got their first start like Savannah Hernandez.
[30:18.000 --> 30:24.000]  How many people have just been put on a launch pad to outer space because of Alex Jones, including myself.
[30:24.000 --> 30:29.000]  I've been given so many opportunities because of this man and because of this platform.
[30:29.000 --> 30:33.000]  And I would probably not even be half of where I am right now if it weren't for Alex Jones.
[30:33.000 --> 30:39.000]  I mean, I've been able to be on podcasts with Alex and Joe Rogan and Tim Cast, the super Tim Cast IRL.
[30:39.000 --> 30:47.000]  Listen, what I'm saying is do not take Alex Jones and band.video for granted because you don't know what you have until it's gone.
[30:47.000 --> 30:50.000]  We need to support free speech systems right now.
[30:50.000 --> 30:54.000]  So go check out the store. Go support their store. Go support info wars.
[30:54.000 --> 31:20.000]  Leave a donation right now. Don't wait until they're gone.
[31:20.000 --> 31:24.000]  The bad news is the enemy is intensifying their attacks on every front, but I'm not going to back down.
[31:24.000 --> 31:26.000]  And I'll never give up, but I could give out.
[31:26.000 --> 31:28.000]  So please keep me on the field.
[31:28.000 --> 31:33.000]  Keep me on the front lines against the enemy while getting great products at the same time that will empower you and your family.

[32:52.000 --> 32:56.000]  This is our new Infowars MD, Incredible Line.
[33:23.000 --> 33:29.000]  Waging war on corruption, it's Alex Jones.
[33:29.000 --> 33:37.000]  You want tomorrow's news, you want next year's news, you want next decade's news today, you get it here.
[33:37.000 --> 33:43.000]  You know what we're talking about. That's why the enemies of humanity want us off the air.
[33:43.000 --> 33:52.000]  It's only you, the listeners and viewers that stand between the globalists and this broadcast, and I thank you for defending us standing with us.
[33:52.000 --> 33:55.000]  I salute you again. Remember that.
[33:55.000 --> 34:00.000]  All right. I talk about this quite a bit, but it's very important to let this sink in.
[34:00.000 --> 34:04.000]  I know most of you know this, but for new listeners, I'll explain something.
[34:04.000 --> 34:13.000]  The art of authoritarian and totalitarian regimes is always to pick a minority to strip of their rights.
[34:13.000 --> 34:17.000]  And then once the majority doesn't stand up for the minority's rights, everyone's rights are taken.
[34:17.000 --> 34:26.000]  That's why in a republic, constitutional republic, we're not a pure democracy, you can have 51% vote to say put black people back into slavery.
[34:26.000 --> 34:35.000]  It doesn't happen because there's a bill of rights, there's a constitution enshrining those rights, not creating those rights, but defending them.
[34:35.000 --> 34:43.000]  And so they had the Cold War to set up the police state and the spy grid, and then when that was ending, they needed 9-11, not saying radical Islam doesn't exist,
[34:43.000 --> 34:51.000]  but as a pretext to expand the control and the Patriot Act and the total information awareness network.
[34:51.000 --> 34:58.000]  And then you notice they've now segwayed out of that into environmentalism, where all humans are bad and cows are bad and everything with carbon is bad,
[34:58.000 --> 35:07.000]  and they have to control us and track us and surveil us and censor us for our safety, and then we all carry viruses that are deadly,
[35:07.000 --> 35:12.000]  so we've got to be surveilled and censored and corralled, and they've got to build camps to quarantine people,
[35:12.000 --> 35:17.000]  and folks have to be disappeared and now in Australia and Canada and the UK and Germany,
[35:17.000 --> 35:23.000]  well if you protest a lockdown, that's bad too, we'll take you to a COVID center for that as well, so they're just mainlining this.
[35:23.000 --> 35:30.000]  So first it's got to take your rights because of the Russians, then it's got to take your rights because of the Muslims while the borders are wide open,
[35:30.000 --> 35:36.000]  then it's all got to take your rights to save the earth and oh, to save you from the deadly virus and save you from yourself.
[35:36.000 --> 35:43.000]  So there's a lot of these compilations out there, and I came across one today that just shows some local newscasts and the police and firefighters saying
[35:43.000 --> 35:48.000]  they were given the order to get back from Building 7, the 47-story FBI CIA headquarters,
[35:48.000 --> 35:54.000]  the second largest FBI CIA substation in the United States in the world,
[35:54.000 --> 36:03.000]  and that day I remember at 4 o'clock in the afternoon, I've been on air since the morning, I drove down the street like a mile to a pizza place to get a pizza,
[36:03.000 --> 36:07.000]  and I'm driving back and they had CBS radio still on the air then on KLBJ 590,
[36:07.000 --> 36:14.000]  and I heard CBS News report that they were going to blow up Building 7 in about 15 minutes to save the other buildings.
[36:14.000 --> 36:19.000]  Well, it takes days to plant explosives in a building, folks, if not weeks.
[36:19.000 --> 36:24.000]  But back then things weren't archived on the Internet, but years later things got archived,
[36:24.000 --> 36:28.000]  once there was enough bandwidth, enough compression, enough servers.
[36:28.000 --> 36:34.000]  So about five years after 9-11, all these videos got put online, and the audio, the newscast, and the rest of it,
[36:34.000 --> 36:42.000]  CBS, NBC, CNN, BBC, and then later they said, no, we never said that, it's a conspiracy theory.
[36:42.000 --> 36:48.000]  Well, here's a compilation of some of those, and also the dancing Israelis that got arrested across the water in New Jersey
[36:48.000 --> 36:53.000]  jumping up and down that were videotaping it, and I'm not saying Israel did 9-11,
[36:53.000 --> 36:56.000]  but the way the globalists work is they get multiple intelligence agencies involved,
[36:56.000 --> 37:04.000]  just like Epstein was Mossad, MI6, and CIA, I do believe elements of Israeli government were involved in 9-11,
[37:04.000 --> 37:08.000]  and it's come out that Israel's helped fund Al Qaeda and ISIS, so is our government.
[37:08.000 --> 37:12.000]  So there's also a few clips of that, so here's that short compilation.
[37:12.000 --> 37:21.000]  Department, the fire department, and they did use the word, we're going to have to bring it down.
[37:21.000 --> 37:26.000]  We heard this sound, it sounded like it collapsed under, it looked like there was a shockwave
[37:26.000 --> 37:30.000]  ripping through the building, and the windows all busted out.
[37:30.000 --> 37:35.000]  About a second later, the box was full of caves out, the building followed after that,
[37:35.000 --> 37:42.000]  and we saw the building crash down all the way to the ground.
[37:42.000 --> 37:46.000]  And I turned in time to see what looked like a skyscraper implosion,
[37:46.000 --> 37:53.000]  it looked like it had been done by a demolition crew, the whole thing just collapsed and got on itself.
[37:53.000 --> 37:54.000]  Okay, hit pause for a moment.
[37:54.000 --> 37:58.000]  Coming up is Larry Silverstein from a PBS documentary that aired two years after 9-11,
[37:58.000 --> 38:02.000]  saying they gave the order to pull it and watch the building come down,
[38:02.000 --> 38:06.000]  pull it means control demolition, but hear it for yourself.
[38:06.000 --> 38:13.000]  It was almost as if it were a planned implosion, it just pancaked.
[38:13.000 --> 38:17.000]  I remember getting a call from the fire department commander,
[38:17.000 --> 38:21.000]  telling me that they were not sure they were going to be able to contain the fire.
[38:21.000 --> 38:24.000]  I said, you know, we've had such terrible loss of life.
[38:24.000 --> 38:30.000]  Maybe the smartest thing to do is pull it, and they made that decision to pull,
[38:30.000 --> 38:35.000]  and then we watched the building collapse.
[38:35.000 --> 38:37.000]  Hit pause again.
[38:37.000 --> 38:45.000]  So this is one of those type situations where the CDC in October 2000 put out a document months before the shots began,
[38:45.000 --> 38:51.000]  saying it will cause blood clots, myocarditis, strokes, dozens of other horrible things, infertility,
[38:51.000 --> 38:53.000]  and it was all true and they knew.
[38:53.000 --> 38:55.000]  And they wanted to just act like that's not there.
[38:55.000 --> 38:57.000]  Same thing with this.
[38:57.000 --> 39:00.000]  I interviewed the firefighters and police that heard the countdown
[39:00.000 --> 39:06.000]  and were told that the building was about to be brought down by the feds.
[39:06.000 --> 39:11.000]  And then we interviewed the deputy head of New York emergency management, Barry Jennings,
[39:11.000 --> 39:14.000]  mysteriously died after we interviewed him.
[39:14.000 --> 39:17.000]  But we talked to the neighbors, they said there was all these vans and feds there,
[39:17.000 --> 39:20.000]  and that they moved out of the house before he was announced dead.
[39:20.000 --> 39:23.000]  So probably witness relocation program.
[39:23.000 --> 39:24.000]  But who knows, he may have actually died.
[39:24.000 --> 39:25.000]  We don't know.
[39:25.000 --> 39:27.000]  We're allowed to speculate here.
[39:27.000 --> 39:31.000]  But that's how deep I investigated this, okay?
[39:31.000 --> 39:33.000]  Went to New York, does this at times, covered it.
[39:33.000 --> 39:36.000]  So I talked to the eyewitnesses, not just the clips.
[39:36.000 --> 39:39.000]  And now here's where the Israelis come in.
[39:39.000 --> 39:43.000]  Since September 11th, more than 60 Israelis have been arrested or detained
[39:43.000 --> 39:48.000]  either under the new patriot anti-terrorism law or for immigration violations.
[39:48.000 --> 39:53.000]  A handful of active Israeli military were among those detained according to investigators
[39:53.000 --> 39:57.000]  who say some of the detainees also failed polygraph questions
[39:57.000 --> 40:02.000]  when asked about alleged surveillance activities against and in the United States.
[40:02.000 --> 40:07.000]  Numerous classified documents obtained by Fox News indicate that even prior to September 11th,
[40:07.000 --> 40:12.000]  as many as 140 other Israelis had been detained or arrested
[40:12.000 --> 40:18.000]  in a secretive and sprawling investigation into suspected espionage by Israelis in the United States.
[40:18.000 --> 40:23.000]  The majority of those questioned, quote, stated they served in military intelligence,
[40:23.000 --> 40:28.000]  electronic surveillance intercept, and or explosive ordinance units.
[40:28.000 --> 40:32.000]  All right, so just thought I'd get that out there, hadn't covered that in a while.
[40:32.000 --> 40:35.000]  That's when the American people were being made the enemy.
[40:35.000 --> 40:40.000]  And now environmentalism, the virus, you're even more the enemy, see how that works.
[40:40.000 --> 40:44.000]  And I told you back at the time you would be the target out of the target and now we are.
[40:44.000 --> 40:48.000]  Now let's shift gears into the New World Order
[40:48.000 --> 40:52.000]  and how they want to cut your resources off and get you totally under their control
[40:52.000 --> 40:57.000]  with a social credit score, social system of the universal basic income.
[40:57.000 --> 41:02.000]  Thousands protesting against World Economic Forum backed 15-minute cities in the UK
[41:02.000 --> 41:05.000]  where they're now dividing towns and cities into quadrants
[41:05.000 --> 41:09.000]  and not letting you leave in your car or come in with a car into those areas.
[41:09.000 --> 41:13.000]  Now they're talking about making you wear bracelets to come and go.
[41:13.000 --> 41:16.000]  This is all part of a gender 2030.
[41:16.000 --> 41:20.000]  Here's another one, Democrats in Minnesota now following California, the passed a law last year.
[41:20.000 --> 41:24.000]  Now pushing for a ban on gas-powered lawnmowers and chainsaws
[41:24.000 --> 41:30.000]  and, of course, a ban of wood-fired stoves and, of course, fireplaces.
[41:30.000 --> 41:34.000]  When we come back, we have Nancy Pelosi back in 1992
[41:34.000 --> 41:37.000]  after George Herbert Walker Bush signed a gender 21,
[41:37.000 --> 41:42.000]  the radio-general packed trying to get it passed in the US House of Representatives.
[41:42.000 --> 41:46.000]  Because remember, you can pull up literally hundreds of news articles
[41:46.000 --> 41:53.000]  with the Washington Post and CNN and the New York Times saying that it does not exist.
[41:53.000 --> 41:57.000]  There is no agenda 21. There is no agenda 2030.
[41:57.000 --> 41:59.000]  There is no replacement migration.
[41:59.000 --> 42:05.000]  Even though there are official treaties and official plans, they do not exist.
[42:05.000 --> 42:09.000]  Even though it's on the official WEF website, does not exist.
[42:09.000 --> 42:11.000]  Now, if you're for it, it exists and you're a good person,
[42:11.000 --> 42:13.000]  your social credit score will go up.
[42:13.000 --> 42:15.000]  You won't be censored for now.
[42:15.000 --> 42:18.000]  But if you say it existed, don't like it, you are now crazy,
[42:18.000 --> 42:22.000]  then it doesn't exist, the definition of gas-sliding.
[42:22.000 --> 42:27.000]  And then we'll shift gears into the brain implant headline,
[42:27.000 --> 42:32.000]  Bill Gates Bezos Invest in Microchip Mind Control Program.
[42:32.000 --> 42:36.000]  That's the headline, CNBC.
[42:36.000 --> 42:38.000]  Oh, my goodness.
[42:38.000 --> 42:41.000]  And so we'll be going over all of that.
[42:41.000 --> 42:44.000]  And there's a lot on the destruction of our children's front.
[42:44.000 --> 42:47.000]  We're going to be breaking down as well straight ahead.
[42:47.000 --> 42:49.000]  And Chris Sky joins us.
[42:49.000 --> 42:53.000]  infowars.com, van.video, and newswars.com.
[42:53.000 --> 42:55.000]  Those are the coordinates of freedom.
[42:55.000 --> 42:57.000]  Those are the coordinates to promote.
[43:00.000 --> 43:04.000]  I talk a lot about the great successes Info Wars has had.
[43:04.000 --> 43:06.000]  I don't think anybody can deny it.
[43:06.000 --> 43:10.000]  And it is because of listeners and viewers supporting us.
[43:10.000 --> 43:13.000]  When we talk about the crew at Info Wars, people behind the scenes,
[43:13.000 --> 43:15.000]  the researchers, the writers,
[43:15.000 --> 43:19.000]  they really have been the MVPs in this fight.
[43:19.000 --> 43:22.000]  And we look at Harrison Smith and Owen Schreuer and the hard work
[43:22.000 --> 43:26.000]  they engage in every day, five, six, seven days a week.
[43:26.000 --> 43:28.000]  It's really just incredible.
[43:28.000 --> 43:30.000]  So for myself, the whole Info Wars crew,
[43:30.000 --> 43:32.000]  I thank you for your past support.
[43:32.000 --> 43:35.000]  I only encourage you now to realize that Info Wars

[43:44.000 --> 43:47.000]  and you never buy great products that enrich and empower your life.

[43:49.000 --> 43:51.000]  I know that less than 1% of our listeners

[45:51.000 --> 45:53.000]  and other online stores.
[45:53.000 --> 46:22.000]  This is our new Info Wars MD incredible line.
[46:23.000 --> 46:25.000]  Info Wars MD will not be taken off the air,
[46:25.000 --> 46:27.000]  but if they can convince you that we've been shut down,
[46:27.000 --> 46:28.000]  they're going to win.
[46:28.000 --> 46:31.000]  Don't let the globalists sigh up you and your family.

[46:38.000 --> 46:41.000]  and let the globalists know their sigh up has not worked.
[46:41.000 --> 46:43.000]  Thanks for keeping us on air.
[46:43.000 --> 46:47.000]  Take action at infowarstore.com today
[46:47.000 --> 46:49.000]  because the only people that can take us off the air
[46:49.000 --> 46:51.000]  is you, the viewers and listeners.
[46:51.000 --> 46:53.000]  The majority of you have not been silent,
[46:53.000 --> 46:54.000]  but some of you have.
[46:54.000 --> 46:56.000]  Do not let the globalist brainwash you.
[46:56.000 --> 47:02.000]  Go to infowarstore.com and get us on the air.
[47:02.000 --> 47:06.000]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order,
[47:06.000 --> 47:17.000]  it's Alex Jones.
[47:17.000 --> 47:19.000]  Welcome back to the final segment of the first hour.
[47:19.000 --> 47:21.000]  I'll be back in the second hour with Chris Skymore.
[47:21.000 --> 47:23.000]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[47:23.000 --> 47:26.000]  So, the globalists need a management system
[47:26.000 --> 47:28.000]  where it makes the public the enemy, the public the problem.
[47:28.000 --> 47:29.000]  That's the fake environmentalism,
[47:29.000 --> 47:33.000]  saying what we breathe, what we exhale is toxic,
[47:33.000 --> 47:36.000]  the carbon dioxide is evil, that we've all got viruses,
[47:36.000 --> 47:39.000]  that we've got to be surveilled and tracked and censored
[47:39.000 --> 47:41.000]  and they've got to take control of our bodies.
[47:41.000 --> 47:45.000]  But if you go back to the Rio de Janeiro Earth Summit in 92,
[47:45.000 --> 47:49.000]  George Herbert Walker Bush, Mr. New World Order signed on to,
[47:49.000 --> 47:52.000]  it's the basis of the carbon taxes, the regulations,
[47:52.000 --> 47:55.000]  the 15 minute cities, the wilderness, corridors,
[47:55.000 --> 47:57.000]  none of it has to do with the environment.
[47:57.000 --> 47:59.000]  All it has to do with a power grab
[47:59.000 --> 48:02.000]  and a surveillance police state grid
[48:02.000 --> 48:06.000]  with the United Nations in control of the whole thing
[48:06.000 --> 48:09.000]  with corporations writing policy for the United Nations.
[48:09.000 --> 48:12.000]  And so here's Nancy Pelosi on the floor of the house
[48:12.000 --> 48:17.000]  in 92 trying to get the treaty ratified
[48:17.000 --> 48:19.000]  and trying to get subsequent bills passed.
[48:19.000 --> 48:20.000]  They didn't.
[48:20.000 --> 48:24.000]  But just like there was never a law passed for carbon taxes
[48:24.000 --> 48:26.000]  to shut down most our coal power plants
[48:26.000 --> 48:29.000]  because they put off carbon dioxide in the plant's breathe,
[48:29.000 --> 48:30.000]  they still did it.
[48:30.000 --> 48:35.000]  The Supreme Court ruled over a year ago that early 2022
[48:35.000 --> 48:38.000]  that the federal government had no power to regulate these plants
[48:38.000 --> 48:40.000]  and say carbon dioxide is toxic without law.
[48:40.000 --> 48:42.000]  They still do it.
[48:42.000 --> 48:44.000]  But at least the Supreme Court's moved in the right direction.
[48:44.000 --> 48:47.000]  So this is cutting off our resources.
[48:47.000 --> 48:49.000]  China makes zero cuts.
[48:49.000 --> 48:51.000]  Mexico makes zero cuts.
[48:51.000 --> 48:53.000]  India and hundreds of other third world countries.
[48:53.000 --> 48:55.000]  But we have to make cuts designed
[48:55.000 --> 48:58.000]  to where the United States cannot be an industrial power.
[48:58.000 --> 49:00.000]  That's the name of the game
[49:00.000 --> 49:02.000]  with the infrastructure falling apart.
[49:02.000 --> 49:05.000]  So here's Nancy Pelosi and the imaginary,
[49:05.000 --> 49:07.000]  according to the New York Times, this does not exist.
[49:07.000 --> 49:09.000]  According to them, this is a deep fake.
[49:09.000 --> 49:10.000]  This is not real.
[49:10.000 --> 49:11.000]  Here it is.
[49:11.000 --> 49:13.000]  The Earth Summit Environmental Leadership Act,
[49:13.000 --> 49:16.000]  as this is known, presents us with an opportunity to follow up
[49:16.000 --> 49:18.000]  on the important work of the Earth Summit
[49:18.000 --> 49:22.000]  to develop its blueprint, Agenda 21,
[49:22.000 --> 49:25.000]  for global environmental action.
[49:25.000 --> 49:30.000]  H-con 353 outlines a comprehensive national strategy
[49:30.000 --> 49:32.000]  for sustainable development
[49:32.000 --> 49:35.000]  in accordance with the principles of Agenda 21
[49:35.000 --> 49:37.000]  to be coordinated under the leadership
[49:37.000 --> 49:39.000]  of a specific office
[49:39.000 --> 49:43.000]  and the direction of a high-level government official.
[49:43.000 --> 49:45.000]  The resolution also urges the United States
[49:45.000 --> 49:47.000]  to identify and initiate further agreements
[49:47.000 --> 49:49.000]  to protect the global environment
[49:49.000 --> 49:51.000]  and to support the creation of a high-level
[49:51.000 --> 49:54.000]  United Nations Sustainable Development Commission
[49:54.000 --> 49:57.000]  headed by an under-secretary general.
[49:57.000 --> 50:00.000]  Third and lastly, the President is urged to report to Congress
[50:00.000 --> 50:04.000]  on the progress made with this action.
[50:04.000 --> 50:08.000]  H-con Res 353 is supported by the administration.
[50:08.000 --> 50:10.000]  I have been in contact with the appropriate offices
[50:10.000 --> 50:12.000]  of the State Department
[50:12.000 --> 50:15.000]  and have incorporated their suggestions into the resolution.
[50:15.000 --> 50:18.000]  The 71 cosponsors of this measure
[50:18.000 --> 50:21.000]  include one-half the members of the Foreign Affairs Committee
[50:21.000 --> 50:24.000]  and all of the House delegates to the Earth Summit.
[50:24.000 --> 50:27.000]  It is also supported by the major United States
[50:27.000 --> 50:29.000]  non-governmental organizations
[50:29.000 --> 50:31.000]  concerned with environmental issues.
[50:31.000 --> 50:34.000]  The Earth Summit presented world leaders with an opportunity
[50:34.000 --> 50:36.000]  that should not be lost.
[50:36.000 --> 50:38.000]  We must now embark on a new course
[50:38.000 --> 50:40.000]  that will sustain our planet
[50:40.000 --> 50:43.000]  and its resources for the benefit of future generations.
[50:43.000 --> 50:46.000]  This resolution calls on the United States
[50:46.000 --> 50:49.000]  to assert its leadership to achieve this goal.
[50:49.000 --> 50:52.000]  I urge my colleagues to support this resolution.
[50:52.000 --> 50:55.000]  Thanks again to the members of the Foreign Affairs Committee
[50:55.000 --> 50:57.000]  for the recognition of the importance
[50:57.000 --> 50:59.000]  and timeliness of this resolution.
[50:59.000 --> 51:03.000]  We must make the promise of Rio a reality.
[51:03.000 --> 51:05.000]  Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
[51:05.000 --> 51:07.000]  And so that's what we've been living under,
[51:07.000 --> 51:09.000]  and now they're going into June of 2030.
[51:09.000 --> 51:13.000]  They called for zero carbon, net zero by 2030,
[51:13.000 --> 51:16.000]  and all the numbers show that would kill billions of people
[51:16.000 --> 51:18.000]  from starvation and death.
[51:18.000 --> 51:20.000]  You've just gotten a little taste of your energy prices
[51:20.000 --> 51:22.000]  doubling and tripling.
[51:22.000 --> 51:24.000]  The third world, half their money goes to food
[51:24.000 --> 51:26.000]  and the rest goes to energy.
[51:26.000 --> 51:28.000]  You cut that offer, you increase the price, people die.
[51:28.000 --> 51:31.000]  But that's what the poisoned shots are all about,
[51:31.000 --> 51:37.000]  maiming you, poisoning you, slowly killing you, sterilizing you.
[51:37.000 --> 51:39.000]  And they do it over and over again.
[51:39.000 --> 51:41.000]  But remember, she said a high-level government official
[51:41.000 --> 51:43.000]  will run all of this.
[51:43.000 --> 51:45.000]  Well, that's what they've had as Department of Energy,
[51:45.000 --> 51:48.000]  Department of Health, Department of Transportation.
[51:48.000 --> 51:51.000]  All these federal agencies just do whatever they want
[51:51.000 --> 51:53.000]  and make law outside of law.
[51:53.000 --> 51:55.000]  The answer is enforce the law.
[51:55.000 --> 51:57.000]  Like, there are laws in the books.
[51:57.000 --> 51:59.000]  There are experimental shots to try to make them take it.
[51:59.000 --> 52:01.000]  It's also the Nuremberg Code.
[52:01.000 --> 52:05.000]  But in places like Louisiana and Missouri and now Idaho,
[52:05.000 --> 52:07.000]  they've got bills introduced that are moving forward
[52:07.000 --> 52:12.000]  to criminalize trying to make somebody or lie into somebody
[52:12.000 --> 52:15.000]  and telling them an mRNA shot is safe.
[52:15.000 --> 52:17.000]  In Idaho, the bill makes an illegal period
[52:17.000 --> 52:20.000]  to give somebody an unapproved shot, which it is illegal,
[52:20.000 --> 52:23.000]  but they just bypass that with all the emergency orders
[52:23.000 --> 52:26.000]  that Trump and then Biden continued on with.
[52:26.000 --> 52:30.000]  That's the scope of a newscast on the legislation in Idaho.
[52:30.000 --> 52:33.000]  Well, some Idaho lawmakers are now looking into adding
[52:33.000 --> 52:37.000]  criminal charges for anyone who administers an mRNA vaccine
[52:37.000 --> 52:39.000]  like a COVID or flu shot.
[52:39.000 --> 52:42.000]  A bill officially introduced into the Idaho State Legislature
[52:42.000 --> 52:44.000]  would do just that.
[52:44.000 --> 52:47.000]  Tonight at 6, Bronte Serotsky joins us live in studio
[52:47.000 --> 52:50.000]  and explains what mRNA vaccines are
[52:50.000 --> 52:54.000]  and why some lawmakers in Idaho want them gone.
[52:54.000 --> 52:56.000]  Well, this bill, if passed,
[52:56.000 --> 52:59.000]  would amend Idaho State Code by adding a new section
[52:59.000 --> 53:02.000]  to penalize anyone from administering an mRNA vaccine
[53:02.000 --> 53:04.000]  in the state with a misdemeanor.
[53:04.000 --> 53:07.000]  In Idaho, a misdemeanor offense is punishable by jail time
[53:07.000 --> 53:09.000]  or a fine.
[53:09.000 --> 53:14.000]  And we are seeing more and more concerns rising
[53:14.000 --> 53:17.000]  because of the mRNA vaccine.
[53:17.000 --> 53:19.000]  Idaho Senator Tammy Nichols,
[53:19.000 --> 53:21.000]  one of the lawmakers sponsoring this bill,
[53:21.000 --> 53:24.000]  says she's had concerns about the COVID-19 vaccine
[53:24.000 --> 53:27.000]  because it was administered under an emergency use authorization
[53:27.000 --> 53:30.000]  before receiving FDA approval.
[53:30.000 --> 53:32.000]  The bill would essentially make it a misdemeanor
[53:32.000 --> 53:35.000]  for anyone to administer an mRNA vaccine
[53:35.000 --> 53:38.000]  like a COVID shot in the state of Idaho.
[53:38.000 --> 53:43.000]  We have issues that this was fast tracked.
[53:43.000 --> 53:46.000]  There's no liability. There's no access to data.
[53:46.000 --> 53:50.000]  The risk benefit analysis has not been done.
[53:50.000 --> 53:52.000]  There's no informed consent.
[53:52.000 --> 53:55.000]  But other lawmakers in the bill's hearing pointed out
[53:55.000 --> 53:58.000]  that the COVID vaccine did get a full FDA approval
[53:58.000 --> 54:00.000]  after being fast tracked.
[54:00.000 --> 54:04.000]  They ultimately were approved under the ordinary approval process
[54:04.000 --> 54:06.000]  and did ultimately, you know,
[54:06.000 --> 54:09.000]  survive the scrutiny of being subjected to all the normal tests.
[54:09.000 --> 54:13.000]  An mRNA vaccine uses messenger RNA,
[54:13.000 --> 54:16.000]  something we have in our own cells to protect us against illness.
[54:16.000 --> 54:19.000]  And it's almost like a set of instructions.
[54:19.000 --> 54:22.000]  So, your cells use these instructions to make proteins
[54:22.000 --> 54:24.000]  that your body needs,
[54:24.000 --> 54:27.000]  whether it's just to basically function
[54:27.000 --> 54:30.000]  or it's to protect itself against illnesses like COVID.
[54:30.000 --> 54:34.000]  Some examples of other mRNA vaccines include flu shots,
[54:34.000 --> 54:36.000]  rabies, Zika,
[54:36.000 --> 54:39.000]  and scientists are even studying these vaccines to treat cancer.
[54:39.000 --> 54:43.000]  But Senator Nichols says she'd like Idaho to go a different route.
[54:43.000 --> 54:48.000]  There's multiple types of COVID shots that are available.
[54:48.000 --> 54:51.000]  The state of Idaho has used other types.
[54:51.000 --> 54:54.000]  There are other shots that we can utilize
[54:54.000 --> 54:57.000]  that do not have the mRNA in it.
[54:57.000 --> 54:59.000]  All right, folks.
[54:59.000 --> 55:01.000]  It is not a vaccine. It is a gene therapy.
[55:01.000 --> 55:04.000]  And they have blown away the approval process
[55:04.000 --> 55:06.000]  and violated federal law and it's criminal.
[55:06.000 --> 55:08.000]  And this is the right action.
[55:08.000 --> 55:10.000]  Here's a clip from 2009 on Jesse Ventura's show
[55:10.000 --> 55:12.000]  where I specifically warn him
[55:12.000 --> 55:14.000]  of what's coming with these new poison shots
[55:14.000 --> 55:18.000]  with Dr. Rima Labo, married to the former head of the Army Special Operations.
[55:18.000 --> 55:21.000]  General Stubblebine, she was working on heads of state
[55:21.000 --> 55:24.000]  who told her they were planning to depopulate
[55:24.000 --> 55:26.000]  through poison vaccines.
[55:26.000 --> 55:29.000]  Here we are many, many years ago, warning the world.
[55:29.000 --> 55:33.000]  There's an entire agenda afoot to force the population
[55:33.000 --> 55:36.000]  to undergo different type of medical treatments,
[55:36.000 --> 55:38.000]  namely vaccines.
[55:38.000 --> 55:41.000]  We're seeing a medical tyranny being set up,
[55:41.000 --> 55:44.000]  not only in the United States, but worldwide,
[55:44.000 --> 55:47.000]  under the UN and the World Health Organization.
[55:47.000 --> 55:48.000]  Who's behind all this?
[55:48.000 --> 55:50.000]  The Bilderberg Group.
[55:50.000 --> 55:52.000]  They want a planetary dictatorship
[55:52.000 --> 55:55.000]  so they can carry out their forced depopulation agenda,
[55:55.000 --> 55:57.000]  and they want to do it through the medical system.
[55:57.000 --> 55:59.000]  And that's why vaccines are so important.
[55:59.000 --> 56:01.000]  We know that many of these vaccines
[56:01.000 --> 56:03.000]  turn out to have serious adverse reactions
[56:03.000 --> 56:05.000]  that this is being done by design.
[56:05.000 --> 56:07.000]  They kill you slowly over time.
[56:07.000 --> 56:09.000]  That's why they're called soft kill.
[56:09.000 --> 56:12.000]  I think you should really talk to Dr. Rima Labo,
[56:12.000 --> 56:14.000]  but she doesn't live inside the United States
[56:14.000 --> 56:17.000]  because she's so concerned about all the police state development.
[56:17.000 --> 56:18.000]  Do you want to come in and sit down?
[56:18.000 --> 56:19.000]  No, sir. I'd rather not.
[56:19.000 --> 56:21.000]  You'd rather just be here
[56:21.000 --> 56:23.000]  so you can make a fast exit if you have to.
[56:23.000 --> 56:25.000]  As soon as you and I finish,
[56:25.000 --> 56:27.000]  I'm leaving the country again.
[56:27.000 --> 56:30.000]  Why? Because in a very short time,
[56:30.000 --> 56:33.000]  not today, not tomorrow, but very soon,
[56:33.000 --> 56:36.000]  we'll be facing compulsory vaccination
[56:36.000 --> 56:41.000]  under the mistaken term of voluntary vaccination.
[56:41.000 --> 56:43.000]  What is it about these vaccinations?
[56:43.000 --> 56:44.000]  You think that they're bad?
[56:44.000 --> 56:46.000]  Well, first of all, let's start with the fact
[56:46.000 --> 56:50.000]  that the World Health Organization has decided
[56:50.000 --> 56:54.000]  that we have 90% too many people.
[56:54.000 --> 56:59.000]  The World Health Organization has been working since 1974
[56:59.000 --> 57:03.000]  on vaccines to create permanent sterility.
[57:03.000 --> 57:06.000]  Doctor, the response is going to be, you're crazy.
[57:06.000 --> 57:07.000]  How can you say this?
[57:07.000 --> 57:09.000]  We've actually got the HD of that.
[57:09.000 --> 57:11.000]  Well, sometime this week, I ought to air the entire episode
[57:11.000 --> 57:13.000]  that I basically wrote the research for,
[57:13.000 --> 57:15.000]  that particular episode, that and the FEMA camp episode,
[57:15.000 --> 57:18.000]  got erased off people's DVRs and they censored it.
[57:18.000 --> 57:20.000]  They got top ratings for True TV.
[57:20.000 --> 57:22.000]  But how do we know all this?
[57:22.000 --> 57:25.000]  Well, today, the UN is trying to pass a world treaty
[57:25.000 --> 57:27.000]  to take control of your body and run your life
[57:27.000 --> 57:29.000]  and make you take shots and have more lockdowns.
[57:29.000 --> 57:30.000]  That's the year 2023.
[57:30.000 --> 57:31.000]  This has been the plan.
[57:31.000 --> 57:33.000]  And she was told by multiple heads of state
[57:33.000 --> 57:35.000]  of the plan and so was her husband,
[57:35.000 --> 57:37.000]  who had the highest level security clearance you can get
[57:37.000 --> 57:39.000]  above top secret.
[57:39.000 --> 57:41.000]  All right, we'll be right back with hour number two.
[57:41.000 --> 57:43.000]  Please stay with us until everybody you know tune in.
[57:43.000 --> 57:44.000]  This is an information war.
[57:44.000 --> 57:46.000]  We can't win it without you.
[57:46.000 --> 58:12.000]  You are critical. Stay with us.
[58:16.000 --> 58:19.000]  This is the time they launched their attack in 2020.
[58:19.000 --> 58:23.000]  Alex Jones's info wars and our audience were there
[58:23.000 --> 58:26.000]  to warn the people of the deadly vaccines
[58:26.000 --> 58:28.000]  that we knew were coming.
[58:28.000 --> 58:30.000]  This is why they attack us.
[58:30.000 --> 58:32.000]  This is why we need your support.
[58:32.000 --> 58:34.000]  Because we tell the truth.
[58:34.000 --> 58:36.000]  Alex Jones was right.
[58:36.000 --> 58:39.000]  Join the resistance. Buy products.
[58:39.000 --> 58:42.000]  Donate to the cause. Share the links.
[58:42.000 --> 58:44.000]  Join us in the fight for freedom
[58:44.000 --> 58:50.000]  and help us defeat the new world order.
[58:50.000 --> 58:52.000]  If you go to onlinehealthnow.com
[58:52.000 --> 58:54.000]  connect with trusted and unbiased doctors
[58:54.000 --> 58:56.000]  at the wellness company.
[58:56.000 --> 58:59.000]  And I tell you, I'm honored to be the chief scientific officer
[58:59.000 --> 59:00.000]  of the company.
[59:00.000 --> 59:02.000]  I contribute with like so many else do there.
[59:02.000 --> 59:04.000]  So many wonderful doctors.
[59:04.000 --> 59:06.000]  Far and away, the most popular product
[59:06.000 --> 59:10.000]  is Dr. Vanda Waters detoxification supplement
[59:10.000 --> 59:12.000]  that features natokinase.
[59:12.000 --> 59:14.000]  Natural proteolytic enzyme.
[59:14.000 --> 59:18.000]  This one is the only enzyme that we're aware of right now
[59:18.000 --> 59:20.000]  that dissolves the spike protein.
[59:20.000 --> 59:21.000]  This is very important.
[59:21.000 --> 59:23.000]  The spike protein is loaded in the body
[59:23.000 --> 59:24.000]  with the COVID-19 infection.
[59:24.000 --> 59:26.000]  And definitely with the vaccines,
[59:26.000 --> 59:27.000]  people are lower with the spike protein.
[59:27.000 --> 59:28.000]  They don't feel well.
[59:28.000 --> 59:30.000]  This is a potential solution.
[59:30.000 --> 59:33.000]  Hydroxychloroquine comes from a natural substance.
[59:33.000 --> 59:36.000]  So does ivermectin and now natokinase.
[59:36.000 --> 59:37.000]  Isn't it interesting?
[59:37.000 --> 59:39.000]  Natural substances in a sense
[59:39.000 --> 59:43.000]  is really this man-made disaster SARS-CoV-2 in the vaccines.
[59:43.000 --> 59:44.000]  OnlineHealthNow.com.
[59:44.000 --> 59:45.000]  Thank you for your support.
[59:45.000 --> 59:47.000]  And thank you for getting into that because it's important.
[59:47.000 --> 59:49.000]  You didn't come here to do that, but I made you do it.
[59:53.000 --> 59:55.000]  If you are receiving this transmission,
[59:55.000 --> 01:00:09.000]  you are the resistance.
[01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:10.000]  If the world's a stage,
[01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:15.000]  then is it far-fetched to say that many people simply look the part?
[01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:18.000]  Imagine that a newscaster loses his job and say,
[01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:21.000]  opens a daycare business.
[01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:24.000]  Would you sign your kit up if the owner looked like this?
[01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:27.000]  If asked why you said no and you did say no,
[01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:30.000]  you might say it was something about his face.
[01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:32.000]  Since we formed this opinion about someone
[01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:35.000]  in less than 100 milliseconds of seeing them,
[01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:37.000]  what data goes into that decision?
[01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:39.000]  Are these judgment calls influenced
[01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:42.000]  beyond someone's beauty and attractiveness?
[01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:45.000]  As it turns out, humans have been reading each other's faces
[01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:47.000]  for thousands of years.
[01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:50.000]  This practice is called physiognomy.
[01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:53.000]  Physiognomy dates back to ancient Greece and China
[01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:56.000]  as a way to predict one's outcomes in life.
[01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:58.000]  In the Middle Ages and beyond,
[01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:00.000]  physiognomy became a diagnostic tool
[01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:03.000]  used by scholars and early criminologists.
[01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:06.000]  Modern practitioners like Christian Chua
[01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:10.000]  maintain that face reading is a valid and useful science.
[01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:12.000]  He states that someone's face is a direct result
[01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:15.000]  of their gene expression, or epigenetics,
[01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:19.000]  and can display revealing clues about someone's inner world.
[01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:23.000]  This means that what you learn,
[01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:26.000]  what people tell you, your environment affects
[01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:28.000]  the expression of your genes,
[01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:31.000]  and your genes express it and manifest it
[01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:33.000]  on your facial structure.
[01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:35.000]  I know some people say,
[01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:37.000]  oh, you should not be so judgmental.
[01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:39.000]  Oh, you should not discriminate.
[01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:41.000]  Science call it profiling.
[01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:43.000]  I like this guy.
[01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:46.000]  Skeptics may dismiss Chua's analysis as unscientific,
[01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:49.000]  but what if we harnessed the impartial power
[01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:52.000]  of artificial intelligence to do the face reading for us?
[01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:56.000]  A study conducted by Stanford professor Dr. Michal Kaczynski
[01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:59.000]  used machine learning to scan thousands of faces
[01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:03.000]  in order to predict political orientation, left or right.
[01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:06.000]  The results of the study were shocking.
[01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:09.000]  Once trained on a large enough data set of faces,
[01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:11.000]  the AI was able to predict whether someone
[01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:15.000]  was right or left politically with up to 73% accuracy.
[01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:17.000]  Humans attempting the same task
[01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:19.000]  performed only slightly better than chance,
[01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:22.000]  with a score of 55% accuracy.
[01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:25.000]  In a companion study, the author noted that liberals
[01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:27.000]  were more likely to face the camera directly,
[01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:30.000]  less likely to express disgust,
[01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:33.000]  and were more likely to express surprise.
[01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:36.000]  Another machine learning study conducted by the same
[01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:39.000]  Dr. Kaczynski also found that AI was able to predict
[01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:41.000]  whether or not someone was homosexual
[01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:43.000]  based on their face alone.
[01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:46.000]  Given a single facial image, a classifier could correctly
[01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:51.000]  distinguish between gay and heterosexual men in 81% of cases
[01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:54.000]  and in 74% of cases for women.
[01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:57.000]  Humans once again performed poorly compared to the machine,
[01:02:57.000 --> 01:03:03.000]  with scores of 61% accuracy for men and 54% for women.
[01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:06.000]  Leftist media naturally lost their minds at this
[01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:08.000]  and made articles attempting to poke holes
[01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:10.000]  in Dr. Kaczynski's study.
[01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:14.000]  What's that? Making judgments based on outward characteristics?
[01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:17.000]  Who would ever do such a thing?
[01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:20.000]  So is artificial intelligence proving that our story
[01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:22.000]  is written on our face?
[01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:25.000]  For now, it appears that the answer is yes.
[01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:27.000]  But we must remember that human interaction
[01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:30.000]  is a nuanced, context-heavy phenomenon
[01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:32.000]  that is full of exceptions.
[01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:35.000]  Someone with an inviting facial presentation
[01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:37.000]  may have horrible intentions within.
[01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:40.000]  Someone with a harsh, uninviting facial presentation
[01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:42.000]  may have good intentions within.
[01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:44.000]  Our gut intuition, however,
[01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:46.000]  can bridge these gaps of uncertainty
[01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:49.000]  and make accurate assessments of someone for us.
[01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:51.000]  Unfortunately, globalists have been deploying
[01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:54.000]  a wicked arsenal of toxins and psyops
[01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:56.000]  designed to dampen this powerful,
[01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:58.000]  God-given compass we all possess.
[01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:02.000]  Our gut feelings help us discern between good and evil.
[01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:05.000]  Building the muscle of saying no to those who serve evil,
[01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:07.000]  no matter what they look like,
[01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:09.000]  is a critical spiritual exercise
[01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:12.000]  for all during these accelerated times.
[01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:15.000]  Gavin De Becker, security expert and author
[01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:17.000]  of The Gift of Fear, calls on us to remember
[01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:21.000]  something very important about the word no.
[01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:24.000]  No is a word that must never be negotiated
[01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:27.000]  because the person who chooses not to hear it
[01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:29.000]  is trying to control you.
[01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:32.000]  So if your gut is screaming that something is off
[01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:35.000]  about the unemployed newscaster at your doorstep
[01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:37.000]  pitching you his daycare service,
[01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:39.000]  what are you gonna say?
[01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:41.000]  Oh, my God.
[01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:43.000]  I mean, that is a horror movie cover.
[01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:46.000]  Seriously, he is scarier looking than at the clown.
[01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:50.000]  I mean, would you let your children anywhere near that psychopath?
[01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:52.000]  I mean, look at him, God!
[01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:55.000]  For Infowars.com, this is the Psyopcom.
[01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:58.000]  We'll be right back with Chris Sky. Stay with us.
[01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:03.000]  Mark Twain, one of America's greatest writers
[01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:06.000]  and satirist in Mies,
[01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:09.000]  famously said more than 150 years ago
[01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:13.000]  rumors of his demise had been greatly exaggerated
[01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:15.000]  because the newspapers kept saying he died
[01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:17.000]  decades before he did die.
[01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:19.000]  And it's the same Psyop today.
[01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:22.000]  Infowars is more influential and more powerful
[01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:24.000]  than ever because of your support
[01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:26.000]  and because of the facts of what we've covered
[01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:28.000]  that's true.
[01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:30.000]  But if they can convince you we've been shut down,
[01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:32.000]  if they can convince you that we're going away
[01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:34.000]  and you stop supporting,
[01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:36.000]  you stop spreading the word, then they do win.
[01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:38.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, there's only one group
[01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:40.000]  of people that can shut down Infowars
[01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:42.000]  and that's you, the viewers and listeners.
[01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:44.000]  If you decide we're done, we're done.
[01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:46.000]  If you decide to go to Infowars.com
[01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:48.000]  and get supplements and books and films
[01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:50.000]  and t-shirts and so much more,
[01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:52.000]  we will stay on the air indefinitely.
[01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:54.000]  It is all in your hands.
[01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:56.000]  If you're standing up against the globalists,
[01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:58.000]  go to InfowarsStore.com right now
[01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:00.000]  and keep us on air. It's up to you.
[01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:08.000]  We're now into hour number two, Sunday Live.
[01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:17.000]  From the front lines of the Information War,
[01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:20.000]  it's Alex Jones.
[01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:23.000]  Well, we like to have people on like Tucker Carlson
[01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:25.000]  and Guy Hirsch. They've been on the show many times.
[01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:27.000]  We like to have people on who've been
[01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:29.000]  right, long before anybody else.
[01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:31.000]  And there's so many of these great people
[01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:34.000]  like Dr. Francis Boyle we had on earlier this week.
[01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:38.000]  Of course, we had in studio J. Dyer yesterday,
[01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:41.000]  that great Saturday broadcast, two hours long.
[01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:43.000]  He's posted a Vando video, watch it, share it.
[01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:45.000]  It's really important.
[01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:47.000]  The history of the New World Order,
[01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:49.000]  what's currently happening, what's coming in the future.
[01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:51.000]  But Chris Guy's 39.
[01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:53.000]  He was 14 or 15 years old.
[01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:55.000]  That's 20 plus years.
[01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:57.000]  But he doesn't get his info from me.
[01:06:57.000 --> 01:06:59.000]  Once you know about the New World Order,
[01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:01.000]  you can get it from them as they openly brag about it.
[01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:03.000]  But before we go to him to tell you what's coming next,
[01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:05.000]  he's one of the smartest guys out there
[01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:07.000]  and a great activist, not just in Canada,
[01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:09.000]  but around the world. Let's play a clip of him
[01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:11.000]  two plus years ago, predicting
[01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:13.000]  what would happen with the COVID
[01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:15.000]  tyranny and he totally nailed it.
[01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:17.000]  And then a newer clip where he's telling you
[01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:19.000]  what the 15-minute cities are going to be.
[01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:21.000]  They will get into the central bank digital currencies
[01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:23.000]  and the world we're already living in
[01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:25.000]  and what's coming next.
[01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:27.000]  But here is Chris a few years ago predicting
[01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:29.000]  that they were never going to take their foot
[01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:31.000]  off our neck until we demanded
[01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:33.000]  they take their foot off our neck.
[01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:35.000]  Remember, he said this two plus years ago
[01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:37.000]  right when the lockdowns were just starting.
[01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:39.000]  Here it is.
[01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:41.000]  Canadians, you need an intervention.
[01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:43.000]  Don't need a mask.
[01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:45.000]  A mask is about compliance
[01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:47.000]  because they know Canadians like to do what they're told.
[01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:49.000]  So if they tell you you have to wear a mask,
[01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:51.000]  next they're going to tell you you have to contact trace.
[01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:53.000]  Then they're going to tell you you have to take the vaccine.
[01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:55.000]  And because Canadians like to do what they're told,
[01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:57.000]  they're hoping that everyone just complies.
[01:07:57.000 --> 01:07:59.000]  And then guess what, kids?
[01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:01.000]  Once you take your vaccine,
[01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:03.000]  like a dumb person that doesn't know any better,
[01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:05.000]  they're going to tell you,
[01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:07.000]  sorry, the vaccine isn't as effective
[01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:09.000]  as we thought it was going to be.
[01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:11.000]  So now you still got to wear your mask,
[01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:13.000]  still got to get contact trace,
[01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:15.000]  still have all the restrictions and social distancing
[01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:17.000]  to take your vaccine.
[01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:19.000]  And then what did you get out of all of this?
[01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:21.000]  You got a whole year where you weren't allowed to travel.
[01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:23.000]  Your business was closed.
[01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:25.000]  They took your rights and freedoms.
[01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:27.000]  They forced the vaccine on you.
[01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:29.000]  And what happened?
[01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:31.000]  The same amount of people died.
[01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:33.000]  Everything is the exact same.
[01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:35.000]  And now they're going to put you back on lockdown
[01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:37.000]  and bring it all the way till July of next year
[01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:39.000]  so they can do the same thing again.
[01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:41.000]  Bring you from July, August and September
[01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:43.000]  getting you off lockdown,
[01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:45.000]  you haven't figured it out yet.
[01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:47.000]  It's a perpetual cycle that you never get out of.
[01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:49.000]  And it's a way to take your rights,
[01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:51.000]  your freedoms, close your business,
[01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:53.000]  take your wealth.
[01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:55.000]  Why? So you become dependent on government.
[01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:57.000]  Why? If you're independent,
[01:08:57.000 --> 01:08:59.000]  the government works for you like it's supposed to.
[01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:01.000]  If you depend on the government to give you a paycheck
[01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:03.000]  to feed your family every month
[01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:05.000]  because they closed your business on you,
[01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:07.000]  now the government doesn't work for you,
[01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:09.000]  the government rules you.
[01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:11.000]  So instead of a middle class,
[01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:13.000]  the government, upper class
[01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:15.000]  and the lower class dependence
[01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:17.000]  that rely on the government to survive.
[01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:19.000]  In other words, we have a slave class.
[01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:21.000]  And that's what they're trying to do.
[01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:23.000]  It's that simple.
[01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:25.000]  And then they began to say
[01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:27.000]  we're going to have carbon lockdowns,
[01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:29.000]  environmental lockdowns, we're going to train you to live in your house.
[01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:31.000]  Here's Chris Sky a few months ago
[01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:33.000]  warning about what's happening with the UN
[01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:35.000]  announced 15-minute cities.
[01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:37.000]  When he announced this a few months ago,
[01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:39.000]  Canada had not announced yet
[01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:41.000]  now adopting turning the towns into prisons.
[01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:43.000]  Here it is.
[01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:45.000]  Canadians, you need an intervention
[01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:47.000]  after talking about 15-minute cities
[01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:49.000]  and explaining them in detail
[01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:51.000]  and then going online to see the reaction.
[01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:53.000]  I see the vast majority of people,
[01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:55.000]  especially young people,
[01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:57.000]  completely stupid.
[01:09:57.000 --> 01:09:59.000]  They say things like
[01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:01.000]  why wouldn't you want everything
[01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:03.000]  within a 15-minute walk?
[01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:05.000]  Because, dumbass,
[01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:07.000]  the idea is
[01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:09.000]  the entire purpose of a 15-minute city,
[01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:11.000]  which isn't even a city
[01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:13.000]  when you can only go 1.5 km
[01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:15.000]  in each direction
[01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:17.000]  before you hit the end of your district,
[01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:19.000]  the entire purpose of a 15-minute city
[01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:21.000]  which I've been telling people
[01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:23.000]  is to reduce your so-called
[01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:25.000]  carbon footprint,
[01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:27.000]  which is another way of saying
[01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:29.000]  reduce the amount of miles you travel,
[01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:31.000]  reduce the amount you fly,
[01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:33.000]  reduce the amount you drive,
[01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:35.000]  reduce the amount you eat,
[01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:37.000]  reduce the amount you do everything.
[01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:39.000]  A carbon footprint is a euphemism
[01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:41.000]  for your actual footprint.
[01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:43.000]  But if I'm wrong
[01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:45.000]  and you think I'm lying,
[01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:47.000]  well, I'll post some articles here
[01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:49.000]  where it literally tells you
[01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:51.000]  in the first sentence
[01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:53.000]  that the entire purpose of a 15-minute city
[01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:55.000]  is to reduce your carbon footprint
[01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:57.000]  and especially reduce
[01:10:57.000 --> 01:10:59.000]  your ability to drive
[01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:01.000]  and use motor vehicles.
[01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:03.000]  Why don't they want you to have a car?
[01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:05.000]  A car gives you freedom.
[01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:07.000]  A car gives you the ability to literally drive
[01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:09.000]  across the country.
[01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:11.000]  They don't want that for you.
[01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:13.000]  They want you stuck in a little area
[01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:15.000]  that you can't drive out of.
[01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:17.000]  So they want to make it so you can't drive.
[01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:19.000]  How are they going to do that?
[01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:21.000]  Well, they're already taking away parking spaces.
[01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:23.000]  They're already taking away driving lanes
[01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:25.000]  and replacing them with bike lanes.
[01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:27.000]  They're already making certain roads,
[01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:29.000]  ultra-low emissions roads
[01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:31.000]  so you can only drive an electric car on them.
[01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:33.000]  They're already putting checkpoints
[01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:35.000]  between the different districts
[01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:37.000]  with actual ballards
[01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:39.000]  and things to stop you.
[01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:41.000]  They're actually installing cameras
[01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:43.000]  at those checkpoints so they can find you
[01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:45.000]  when they read your license plate
[01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:47.000]  and you drive where you're not supposed to,
[01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:49.000]  when you're not supposed to.
[01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:51.000]  But no, they're not doing this
[01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:53.000]  because they want to control you.
[01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:55.000]  This is all because they really love you.
[01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:57.000]  They want you to be walking around
[01:11:57.000 --> 01:11:59.000]  and riding around in your little electric scooters.
[01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:01.000]  They really ain't going to be flying
[01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:03.000]  or doing anything like that.
[01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:05.000]  But of course, this is all just a conspiracy theory.
[01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:07.000]  Just put your mask back on,
[01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:09.000]  take your jab,
[01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:11.000]  and enjoy your 15-minute city.
[01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:13.000]  You pathetic peons.
[01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:15.000]  There you go. Chris Sky joins us now
[01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:17.000]  to talk about this and a lot more
[01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:19.000]  and what he thinks is coming next.
[01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:21.000]  Chris, thanks for joining us on the Sunday edition,
[01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:23.000]  my friend. Where do you want to go first?
[01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:25.000]  Well, we're going to get everybody
[01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:27.000]  to understand
[01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:29.000]  that COVID was basically phase one.
[01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:31.000]  COVID was there to train everybody
[01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:33.000]  two big things.
[01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:35.000]  Number one, that the rights and freedoms
[01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:37.000]  that have always been paramount to society
[01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:39.000]  and that
[01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:41.000]  worth fighting world wars over
[01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:43.000]  were no longer paramount to society.
[01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:45.000]  In fact, they're selfish and dangerous.
[01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:47.000]  And those people who would advocate
[01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:49.000]  for them are also dangerous.
[01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:51.000]  Step two,
[01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:53.000]  in their little training program,
[01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:55.000]  which we call COVID,
[01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:57.000]  to convince people that individual
[01:12:57.000 --> 01:12:59.000]  responsibility is a thing of the past.
[01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:01.000]  And we are now collectively responsible
[01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:03.000]  for everyone.
[01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:05.000]  I need to wear my mask to protect you, Alex.
[01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:07.000]  Now, you transfer
[01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:09.000]  those two new ideas
[01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:11.000]  to the next phase of their plan,
[01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:13.000]  which is to perpetuate the lockdowns,
[01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:15.000]  perpetuate the government control,
[01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:17.000]  but not just for the duration of a pandemic,
[01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:19.000]  but for the duration of generations yet
[01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:21.000]  to come combined with more technocratic
[01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:23.000]  control grids.
[01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:25.000]  And you have to understand that the next phase of this
[01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:27.000]  is the climate change
[01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:29.000]  environmental phase.
[01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:31.000]  And they're planning on using
[01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:33.000]  the combination of 15-minute cities,
[01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:35.000]  a personal
[01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:37.000]  carbon allowance, and people need to write that down,
[01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:39.000]  personal carbon allowance,
[01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:41.000]  and finally, the idea of a digital currency
[01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:43.000]  to fully enslave
[01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:45.000]  humanity like we saw
[01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:47.000]  happening with the COVID lockdowns.
[01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:49.000]  But not for
[01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:51.000]  temporarily and not for your health and safety,
[01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:53.000]  but now permanently
[01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:55.000]  and so we can protect the planet.
[01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:57.000]  A 15-minute city tells you that
[01:13:57.000 --> 01:13:59.000]  everything you need is going to be a 15-minute
[01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:01.000]  walk from where you live.
[01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:03.000]  Well, since September,
[01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:05.000]  I've been in England,
[01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:07.000]  Ireland, Belgium, France,
[01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:09.000]  Netherlands, Germany,
[01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:11.000]  Mexico, Peru,
[01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:13.000]  Colombia, all over Canada.
[01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:15.000]  I talked to the residents of Oxford,
[01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:17.000]  England, one of the first places to put
[01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:19.000]  these 15-minute cities, where they are
[01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:21.000]  now rioting.
[01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:23.000]  Oxford was divided into six districts.
[01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:25.000]  Oxford started getting rid of vehicle traffic.
[01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:27.000]  Oxford started putting
[01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:29.000]  ballards and barriers
[01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:31.000]  and traffic cameras
[01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:33.000]  that would automatically find people for leaving
[01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:35.000]  their district when they weren't allowed.
[01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:37.000]  They had to get travel passes to leave their district
[01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:39.000]  when they weren't allowed.
[01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:41.000]  And this is the plan they want to do for everyone.
[01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:43.000]  And everybody believes that this 15-minute city idea
[01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:45.000]  is a national thing.
[01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:47.000]  And it's just happening around the world by accident.
[01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:49.000]  It's like COVID. It's starting in Europe.
[01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:51.000]  And whatever they do in Europe,
[01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:53.000]  they bring over to North America.
[01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:55.000]  So that's what's going to happen.
[01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:57.000]  And the only way we can stop it
[01:14:57.000 --> 01:14:59.000]  is by people getting aware and understanding
[01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:01.000]  what a 15-minute city really is.
[01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:03.000]  Do you really want to be confined
[01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:05.000]  to an area where you can only walk
[01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:07.000]  or bike 15 minutes in each direction,
[01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:09.000]  especially in a country like Canada?
[01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:11.000]  And then again, only select corporations
[01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:13.000]  are allowed to even come in. So you got to buy from them.
[01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:15.000]  You have your credits all controlled
[01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:17.000]  by the federal currencies of where you can spend them
[01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:19.000]  and how. This has all been announced.
[01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:21.000]  That's right. And that's exactly what they want to do.
[01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:23.000]  And they want to make your district identical
[01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:25.000]  to the district next to you. There's no more small business.
[01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:27.000]  There's Starbucks, McDonald's, Amazon,
[01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:29.000]  Walmart in your district,
[01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:31.000]  and the same stores in the next district.
[01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:33.000]  So you really have no need to leave your district.
[01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:35.000]  And then to make sure that you won't be able
[01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:37.000]  to leave your district, they're going to have
[01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:39.000]  financial constraints with environmental...
[01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:41.000]  And there's only
[01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:43.000]  bug protein on the menu at those places.
[01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:45.000]  This is the total prison
[01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:47.000]  enslavement grid, but humanity's waking up
[01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:49.000]  and fighting back. The new order is not coming, folks.
[01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:51.000]  It's here. Chris Sky is our guest.
[01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:53.000]  We'll come right back with him straight ahead
[01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:55.000]  to everybody you know. Tune in now.
[01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:57.000]  Now. Now. Now. Now. Now. Now. Now. Now. Now.
[01:15:57.000 --> 01:15:59.000]  Now.
[01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:01.000]  Everybody that's watching this needs to support
[01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:03.000]  Alex Jones, needs to support
[01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:05.000]  Infowars and Band.video.
[01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:07.000]  You know, the Bible says, let another mouth
[01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:09.000]  praise you. I'm going to do that right now.
[01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:11.000]  Alex Jones has helped so
[01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:13.000]  many people in this industry.
[01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:15.000]  You guys have no idea how many
[01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:17.000]  people have got their first start, like Savannah Hernandez.
[01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:19.000]  How many people have
[01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:21.000]  just been put on a launch pad
[01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:23.000]  to outer space because of Alex Jones,
[01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:25.000]  including myself. I've been given so
[01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:27.000]  many opportunities because of this man
[01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:29.000]  and because of this platform. And I would
[01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:31.000]  probably not even be half of where I
[01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:33.000]  am right now if it weren't for Alex Jones.
[01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:35.000]  I mean, I've been able to be on podcasts
[01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:37.000]  with Alex and Joe Rogan and Tim Kast,
[01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:39.000]  the super Tim Kast IRL.
[01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:41.000]  Listen, what I'm saying is, do not
[01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:43.000]  take Alex Jones and Band.video
[01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:45.000]  for granted because you don't know
[01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:47.000]  what you have until it's gone. We need
[01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:49.000]  to support free speech systems right
[01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:51.000]  now. So go check out the store. Go
[01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:53.000]  support their store. Go support Infowars.
[01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:55.000]  Leave a donation right now.
[01:16:55.000 --> 01:16:57.000]  Don't wait until they're gone.
[01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:01.000]  In the year 2000, Alex Jones's
[01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:03.000]  film Dark Secrets Inside
[01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:05.000]  Bohemian Grove showed
[01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:07.000]  the world how our so-called elite
[01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:09.000]  leaders practice mock
[01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:11.000]  ritual sacrifices in
[01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:13.000]  private.
[01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:15.000]  In 2007,
[01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:17.000]  Alex Jones releases Endgame
[01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:19.000]  exposing the world elite's plans
[01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:21.000]  for covertly using
[01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:23.000]  biological weapons against all
[01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:25.000]  of mankind. And by the time
[01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:27.000]  they launched their attack in
[01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:29.000]  2020, Alex Jones's
[01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:31.000]  Infowars and our audience
[01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:33.000]  were there to warn the people
[01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:35.000]  of the deadly vaccines that we
[01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:37.000]  knew were coming. This is
[01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:39.000]  why they attack us. This is
[01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:41.000]  why we need your support.
[01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:43.000]  Because we tell the truth, Alex
[01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:45.000]  Jones was right.

[01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:57.000]  world order.
[01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:01.000]  The cavalry has arrived.
[01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:03.000]  Ultimate bone broth
[01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:05.000]  is the strongest, highest
[01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:07.000]  quality chicken-based bone
[01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:09.000]  broth you're going to find with all

[01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:13.000]  your muscles, your heart. But more
[01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:15.000]  importantly, your immune system.
[01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:17.000]  Everybody knows about grandma and chicken
[01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:19.000]  broth. Well, this is concentrated chicken
[01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:21.000]  broth, the strongest out there with
[01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:23.000]  chocolate mushroom, and a whole
[01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:25.000]  bunch of other ingredients like turmeric.
[01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:27.000]  The list goes on and on. This is
[01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:29.000]  definitely the strongest, best bone
[01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:31.000]  broth out there and your purchase

[01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:05.000]  I'm 45, and I have
[01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:07.000]  bits, I go to the gym, and I have bits
[01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:09.000]  that won't move.
[01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:11.000]  And Diet Force has helped me move those
[01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:13.000]  bits, like
[01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:15.000]  under my pecs, my belly,

[01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:19.000]  We're coming up with a big lineup of guests
[01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:21.000]  breaking news on multiple fronts from
[01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:23.000]  the anti-World War 3 protests
[01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:25.000]  in D.C. to witnesses
[01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:27.000]  and reporters from on the ground in Ohio
[01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:29.000]  and
[01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:31.000]  Palestine so much more.
[01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:33.000]  Chris Sky's our guest right now, and I want to
[01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:35.000]  get big picture, Elon Musk at the World
[01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:37.000]  Government Forum last week saying it's a bad idea
[01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:39.000]  all the poison shots
[01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:41.000]  what he thinks is coming next, one of the
[01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:43.000]  smartest folks out there. But Chris, you wanted
[01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:45.000]  to finish up with the carbon dictatorship
[01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:47.000]  worldwide and the 15-minute cities.
[01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:49.000]  Yes, because
[01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:51.000]  the 15-minute city, we already discussed
[01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:53.000]  how they're going to physically keep you within
[01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:55.000]  your city and how they're setting up the city
[01:20:55.000 --> 01:20:57.000]  to keep you within your own area.
[01:20:57.000 --> 01:20:59.000]  But now we're going to talk about financially
[01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:01.000]  and psychologically how they're going to do that.
[01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:03.000]  And it's called a personal carbon allowance.
[01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:05.000]  There's huge propaganda right now to get
[01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:07.000]  you to track your so-called carbon footprint.
[01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:09.000]  You can even get a master card that will track
[01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:11.000]  every single purchase you make.
[01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:13.000]  If you buy a plane ticket right now, it'll show
[01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:15.000]  you how much carbon you're actually using.
[01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:17.000]  And according
[01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:19.000]  to the idea of 15-minute city,
[01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:21.000]  the whole idea is to reduce
[01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:23.000]  your so-called carbon footprint, which is a
[01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:25.000]  euphemism for reducing your actual footprint.
[01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:27.000]  So they are now putting carbon limits
[01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:29.000]  on every single thing you use,
[01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:31.000]  every single thing you buy. If you go to the store
[01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:33.000]  and you look at kale, it's going to have a very
[01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:35.000]  low carbon rating, so you can eat as much as you want.
[01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:37.000]  Same thing with the crickets that they want you to eat.
[01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:39.000]  Meanwhile, if you go to try to eat the steak,
[01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:41.000]  it's going to have a very high so-called
[01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:43.000]  carbon rating, which is a new tax.
[01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:45.000]  And eventually, they're going to start charging
[01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:47.000]  you about $170
[01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:49.000]  for every so-called
[01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:51.000]  ton that you go over your limit.
[01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:53.000]  Now in North America, they tell us that we use
[01:21:53.000 --> 01:21:55.000]  over 20 tons of carbon a year.
[01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:57.000]  And according to the Paris Climate Accords
[01:21:57.000 --> 01:21:59.000]  that we all signed on to, if we don't reduce
[01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:01.000]  that to two tons from
[01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:03.000]  20, we're all going to die.
[01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:05.000]  So they want you to reduce 90% of your so-called
[01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:07.000]  carbon footprint
[01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:09.000]  in order to save the so-called planet.
[01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:11.000]  And that's where they're going to bring in
[01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:13.000]  15-minute city with the personal
[01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:15.000]  carbon allowance. And the final nail in the coffin
[01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:17.000]  is the digital ID.
[01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:19.000]  Because once they have you on a digital ID,
[01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:21.000]  they can forcibly vaccinate you with a poison injection.
[01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:23.000]  They can mandate anything
[01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:25.000]  they want in order for you to even be able
[01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:27.000]  to have access to spend your money.
[01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:29.000]  And now they get to track, trace,
[01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:31.000]  control, and tax
[01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:33.000]  every single transaction. And by the way, you're not
[01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:35.000]  just saying this, you're not putting a bad face on it.
[01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:37.000]  This is all officially announced by the UN.
[01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:39.000]  They've got a UN world biomedical
[01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:41.000]  tyranny. I had the guy on last week
[01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:43.000]  who literally writes the UN treaties
[01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:45.000]  and the US laws, Dr. Boyle.
[01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:47.000]  And he was just laying out that it is a
[01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:49.000]  worldwide medical police state run by the
[01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:51.000]  UN and the corporations that control it. I mean, it's hard
[01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:53.000]  to overstate how bad this is.
[01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:55.000]  It's
[01:22:55.000 --> 01:22:57.000]  like COVID, but way worse.
[01:22:57.000 --> 01:22:59.000]  Because they don't even need to use the stigma of
[01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:01.000]  public health and all the rest of it. They're just
[01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:03.000]  literally doing it. And they're doing it
[01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:05.000]  worldwide. And Elon Musk said
[01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:07.000]  how dangerous a world government is. And he's
[01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:09.000]  not wrong.
[01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:11.000]  He's going to be one of the most powerful men in the
[01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:13.000]  entire world. So we should take note.
[01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:15.000]  Elon is creating a monopoly
[01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:17.000]  for himself. He's got Twitter as the social
[01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:19.000]  media. He's got Starlink
[01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:21.000]  as the internet and cell phone network.
[01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:23.000]  He's making his own Tesla phone, which is
[01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:25.000]  going to destroy all the other phones.
[01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:27.000]  And then he's got his own cryptocurrency.
[01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:29.000]  Then he's making Twitter
[01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:31.000]  its own pay exchange.
[01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:33.000]  So he's going to be able to do credit card transactions
[01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:35.000]  and eventually crypto transactions.
[01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:37.000]  And finally, he's going to link
[01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:39.000]  all of that together with his neural link
[01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:41.000]  implant. So he's literally going to be
[01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:43.000]  inside your brain.
[01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:45.000]  None of the other sides are going to be free. His will
[01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:47.000]  be quasi free. Everybody
[01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:49.000]  will run to that. And he calls it internet
[01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:51.000]  X, total control.
[01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:53.000]  He's going to have complete control. He's
[01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:55.000]  going to be one of the most powerful men in the
[01:23:55.000 --> 01:23:57.000]  world. I believe and I'm saying this here
[01:23:57.000 --> 01:23:59.000]  that he's going to be publicly the world's
[01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:01.000]  first trillionaire that they advertise.
[01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:03.000]  He's going to destroy Jeff Bezos and all these
[01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:05.000]  other so-called rich people.
[01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:07.000]  And that's going to put Elon Musk in a very
[01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:09.000]  unique position. He's going to be one of the
[01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:11.000]  most powerful men in the world. And that's going
[01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:13.000]  to make him either the most dangerous man in the
[01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:15.000]  world or he can be the best thing that ever
[01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:17.000]  happened to humanity. But he's got so much
[01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:19.000]  money. If I had that kind of money, I would
[01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:21.000]  already been the prime minister of Canada and
[01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:23.000]  I would have already taken control of the country.
[01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:25.000]  And by the way, you're about to run for major
[01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:27.000]  office. We're going to talk about that next segment.
[01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:29.000]  But let's talk about this. What is your
[01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:31.000]  opinion on that level analysis?
[01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:33.000]  Because it really guts all the thousands of
[01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:35.000]  data points you've got or that we all have
[01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:37.000]  individually and then we make an approximation
[01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:39.000]  of dead reckoning. I think he's an
[01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:41.000]  Oberton window. He's the so-called freedom
[01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:43.000]  guy over here. Bill Gates is the tyranny guy
[01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:45.000]  of Klaus Schwab. But still it's a controlled
[01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:47.000]  paradigm. So it's an Oberton window
[01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:49.000]  controlling our options.
[01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:51.000]  You're 100% correct, Alex. I wish
[01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:53.000]  I didn't agree with you, but I usually do
[01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:55.000]  and in this case I agree with you 100%.
[01:24:55.000 --> 01:24:57.000]  They always control both sides of the
[01:24:57.000 --> 01:24:59.000]  spectrum. So we already know who the bad guys
[01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:01.000]  are. Klaus Schwab, World Economic
[01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:03.000]  Forum, George Soros, etc.,
[01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:05.000]  W.H.O.
[01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:07.000]  And they've got to give us a good guy.
[01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:09.000]  So they gave us Elon Musk and he is doing a
[01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:11.000]  lot of good. He gave me my Twitter back.
[01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:13.000]  He's giving people all these wonderful
[01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:15.000]  opportunities. But like we say, great power
[01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:17.000]  comes great responsibility and eventually
[01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:19.000]  he's going to have almost absolute power.
[01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:21.000]  And what do we know about absolute power?
[01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:23.000]  It corrupts absolutely.
[01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:25.000]  And he's on the record saying that the most
[01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:27.000]  important thing is AI and merging
[01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:29.000]  humans with computers.
[01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:31.000]  Meanwhile, that's exactly what he's
[01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:33.000]  setting out to do.
[01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:35.000]  He wants to merge humans with computers,
[01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:37.000]  get us literally
[01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:39.000]  inside your head and then send people to Mars.
[01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:41.000]  So he's got very big
[01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:43.000]  ambitions and he's doing a lot.
[01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:45.000]  I have to say he's a very intelligent man
[01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:47.000]  and he's
[01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:49.000]  got a lot of the world supporting
[01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:51.000]  him right now.
[01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:53.000]  He's obviously got a big section of the
[01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:55.000]  world supporting him and he's definitely
[01:25:55.000 --> 01:25:57.000]  being formed as the opposition to the
[01:25:57.000 --> 01:25:59.000]  Neural Order, to be the Neural Order.
[01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:01.000]  I agree with that a million percent.
[01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:03.000]  And if you just look into his history, he had
[01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:05.000]  a lot of government funding
[01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:07.000]  to get where he is.
[01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:09.000]  So like, I don't know,
[01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:11.000]  just if you follow the money, you can
[01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:13.000]  always find the truth.
[01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:15.000]  That's the reality.
[01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:17.000]  So I like a lot of what he's doing.
[01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:19.000]  We have to, we like a lot of what he's doing
[01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:21.000]  and technology is always a double-edged sword.
[01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:23.000]  We need to use it.
[01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:25.000]  The only technology we don't need to use
[01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:27.000]  are their 15-minute cities, their digital
[01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:29.000]  IDs and all their personal
[01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:31.000]  carbon allowance and everything else that they're
[01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:33.000]  trying to use to enslave us.
[01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:35.000]  And the only way they can get us enslaved
[01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:37.000]  is if we do it to ourselves.
[01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:39.000]  Nobody's going to put a gun to your head and say,
[01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:41.000]  you need to start tracking your carbon.
[01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:43.000]  No, they're just going to beat you over the head
[01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:45.000]  with the idea over and over and over again
[01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:47.000]  and tell you you're a horrible person if you don't do it.
[01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:49.000]  And then if the majority of people do it,
[01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:51.000]  that's why we're on this mission.
[01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:53.000]  That's why we're going all over the world
[01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:55.000]  and that's why we're literally breaking
[01:26:55.000 --> 01:26:57.000]  language barriers, psychological barriers,
[01:26:57.000 --> 01:26:59.000]  financial barriers just to
[01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:01.000]  inform the public.
[01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:03.000]  Because if the public is informed,
[01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:05.000]  the public will reject this idea.
[01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:07.000]  Well, that was my next question.
[01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:09.000]  If you had to describe the battle between good
[01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:11.000]  and evil right now, between freedom and tyranny,
[01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:13.000]  team demon and team freedom,
[01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:15.000]  how would you describe this right now,
[01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:17.000]  where we're at? Are we winning?
[01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:19.000]  I think we're winning
[01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:21.000]  and I think they're being very reactive
[01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:23.000]  and I think that's why they're pushing so hard
[01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:25.000]  and fast with the 15 minute cities
[01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:27.000]  and all these other agendas, because
[01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:29.000]  their poison vaccine failed.
[01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:31.000]  It came out that the vaccine not only did not protect,
[01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:33.000]  not only did not stop you from passing on,
[01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:35.000]  but actually made it more likely for you
[01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:37.000]  to be hospitalized and killed.
[01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:39.000]  And in some countries like Australia,
[01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:41.000]  we got to the point where 100% of the people
[01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:43.000]  in the hospital had been vaccinated,
[01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:45.000]  even though 75% of the population was vaccinated.
[01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:47.000]  It didn't work. Everybody caught on
[01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:49.000]  and now they've lost the trust of those people.
[01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:51.000]  And this is the beauty.
[01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:53.000]  Most of the people that took the jabs,
[01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:55.000]  most of the people that wore the mask, didn't want to.
[01:27:55.000 --> 01:27:57.000]  They did it because it was mandated.
[01:27:57.000 --> 01:27:59.000]  They did it because they thought it was law.
[01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:01.000]  They did it because they didn't want to get social stigma.
[01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:03.000]  They didn't want to get ostracized.
[01:28:03.000 --> 01:28:05.000]  But now, they're trying to push basically
[01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:07.000]  the same ideas of tyranny on us,
[01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:09.000]  but they don't have the stigma of a public health epidemic.
[01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:11.000]  They don't have the stigma of mandates.
[01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:13.000]  They don't have the social stigma
[01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:15.000]  of where you're a child
[01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:17.000]  if you don't want a 15-minute city.
[01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:19.000]  So now, not only can we regain
[01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:21.000]  all the traction we had
[01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:23.000]  with the freedom movement,
[01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:25.000]  but we can get all the people who are vaccinated
[01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:27.000]  and regret being vaccinated,
[01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:29.000]  all the people that wore the mask
[01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:31.000]  that realized they did it for no reason.
[01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:33.000]  So we can get a lot more people on our side
[01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:35.000]  and people are going to be a lot more willing to stand out.
[01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:37.000]  I totally agree. Let's talk about
[01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:39.000]  the current situation with the poison shots,
[01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:41.000]  how the wheels have come off,
[01:28:41.000 --> 01:28:43.000]  the same globalist new world order
[01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:45.000]  behind the poison shots, behind the open borders,
[01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:47.000]  behind all the pedophilia, behind all the tyranny,
[01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:49.000]  is behind the entire fake environmental movement,
[01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:51.000]  Reddathonburg, and the whole criminal pack.
[01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:53.000]  I'm Alex Jones. More of Chris Sky.
[01:28:53.000 --> 01:28:55.000]  Straight ahead. Stay with us.
[01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:03.000]  I have been in a 28-year marathon
[01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:05.000]  battle with the globalist.
[01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:07.000]  I have come from nowhere
[01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:09.000]  to the very heights of politics
[01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:11.000]  and not just in America, but in the world.
[01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:13.000]  We are engaging the globalist
[01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:15.000]  at point-blank range
[01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:17.000]  in the information war,
[01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:19.000]  but I don't deserve the credit.
[01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:21.000]  Yes, I've persevered, but the listeners
[01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:23.000]  and viewers who support them for wars
[01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:25.000]  are the real reason we've had the success.
[01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:27.000]  We're having now
[01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:29.000]  the greatest victories in the fight against
[01:29:29.000 --> 01:29:31.000]  the new world order we've ever had.
[01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:33.000]  We are now entering the final
[01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:35.000]  mile of the marathon.
[01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:37.000]  And that's why today
[01:29:37.000 --> 01:29:39.000]  it's more important than ever to realize
[01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:41.000]  how important you've been in this fight
[01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:43.000]  and to continue in the efforts you've been carrying out
[01:29:43.000 --> 01:29:45.000]  and to intensify them.
[01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:47.000]  God bless you all. I salute you.
[01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:49.000]  I thank you, and I beg you
[01:29:49.000 --> 01:29:51.000]  to intensify what you're doing now
[01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:53.000]  because we are over the target
[01:29:53.000 --> 01:29:55.000]  and history is happening.
[01:29:55.000 --> 01:29:57.000]  The fight is my fight. It's your fight.
[01:29:57.000 --> 01:30:07.000]  God bless you all.
[01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:29.000]  It dissolves the spike protein.
[01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:31.000]  This is very important. The spike protein is loaded
[01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:33.000]  in the body with the COVID-19 infection
[01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:35.000]  and definitely with the vaccines.
[01:30:35.000 --> 01:30:37.000]  People are lower with the spike protein.
[01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:39.000]  They don't feel well. This is a potential solution.
[01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:41.000]  Hydroxychloroquine comes from a natural substance.
[01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:43.000]  So does ivermectin
[01:30:43.000 --> 01:30:45.000]  and now natokinase.
[01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:47.000]  Isn't it interesting?
[01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:49.000]  Natural substances in a sense
[01:30:49.000 --> 01:30:51.000]  combating this man-made disaster
[01:30:51.000 --> 01:30:53.000]  SARS-CoV-2 in the vaccines.
[01:30:53.000 --> 01:30:55.000]  OnlineHealthNow.com, thank you for your support
[01:30:55.000 --> 01:30:57.000]  and thank you for getting into that
[01:30:57.000 --> 01:30:59.000]  because it's important. You didn't come here to do that,
[01:30:59.000 --> 01:31:01.000]  but I made you do it.
[01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:03.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, Infowars Live products
[01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:05.000]  have always been the highest quality,
[01:31:05.000 --> 01:31:07.000]  triple-tested, and you've seen the right reviews.
[01:31:07.000 --> 01:31:09.000]  But doing deep research, we made contact
[01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:11.000]  with the top company in the United States
[01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:13.000]  and it turned out they were supplying
[01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:15.000]  almost all the raw materials
[01:31:15.000 --> 01:31:17.000]  to the companies that we were already using.
[01:31:17.000 --> 01:31:19.000]  So we've gone directly to the source
[01:31:19.000 --> 01:31:21.000]  and that means we can give you lower prices
[01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:23.000]  on the very same high quality
[01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:25.000]  supplements, and in some cases even better.

[01:31:53.000 --> 01:31:55.000]  than the same product on store shelves

[01:32:11.000 --> 01:32:13.000]  you save at least
[01:32:13.000 --> 01:32:15.000]  50% on these products
[01:32:15.000 --> 01:32:17.000]  for what you pay for similar products
[01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:19.000]  or the exact same products in stores
[01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:21.000]  around the country. That's because we go right
[01:32:21.000 --> 01:32:23.000]  to the highest quality manufacturer in the nation
[01:32:23.000 --> 01:32:25.000]  that supplies some of the top names.
[01:32:25.000 --> 01:32:27.000]  They then give us the best deal out there
[01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:29.000]  because the owner is a listener and we're able to bring it
[01:32:29.000 --> 01:32:31.000]  to you with massive discounts.
[01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:33.000]  You're not going to find 1,000 milligram

[01:32:35.000 --> 01:32:37.000]  we sell it. You're not going to find it
[01:32:37.000 --> 01:32:39.000]  at the 10 milligram or the 20 milligram.
[01:32:39.000 --> 01:32:41.000]  You're not going to find Tumeric at 95%
[01:32:41.000 --> 01:32:43.000]  of humanoid at the price we're selling it.
[01:32:43.000 --> 01:32:45.000]  You're not going to find any of this anywhere near that.
[01:32:45.000 --> 01:32:47.000]  These similar formulas with the same formulas
[01:32:47.000 --> 01:32:49.000]  all for up to 200%
[01:32:49.000 --> 01:32:51.000]  more than we're selling these.
[01:32:51.000 --> 01:32:53.000]  Infowars MD, now available
[01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:55.000]  exclusively at infowarstore.com
[01:32:55.000 --> 01:33:21.000]  a true 361.
[01:33:21.000 --> 01:33:25.000]  You are listening to an Infowars.com
[01:33:25.000 --> 01:33:27.000]  front line report. If you are receiving this
[01:33:27.000 --> 01:33:29.000]  transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:33:29.000 --> 01:33:31.000]  We are winning.
[01:33:31.000 --> 01:33:33.000]  I totally agree with Chris Skye.
[01:33:33.000 --> 01:33:35.000]  I learned right before I went live
[01:33:35.000 --> 01:33:37.000]  about an hour and 35 minutes ago
[01:33:37.000 --> 01:33:39.000]  that an old friend of mine
[01:33:39.000 --> 01:33:41.000]  is on the show dozens of times
[01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:43.000]  a big listener,
[01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:45.000]  comedian and law and order icon
[01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:47.000]  Richard Belzer,
[01:33:47.000 --> 01:33:51.000]  dead at 78.
[01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:53.000]  And I remember one time he even got
[01:33:53.000 --> 01:33:55.000]  Christopher Walken on the show
[01:33:55.000 --> 01:33:57.000]  and so we'll play a few minutes of that
[01:33:57.000 --> 01:33:59.000]  at the end of the next segment
[01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:01.000]  as I'm ending my show
[01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:03.000]  and Owen Schroyer is preparing to come in
[01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:05.000]  for what we call Sunday Live
[01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:07.000]  two hours of amazing talk radio
[01:34:07.000 --> 01:34:09.000]  slash analysis on TV.
[01:34:09.000 --> 01:34:11.000]  So that's coming up.
[01:34:11.000 --> 01:34:13.000]  We'll be talking more about that.
[01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:15.000]  Yes, that's Christopher Walken sitting in
[01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:17.000]  Richard Belzer's lap as a joke
[01:34:17.000 --> 01:34:19.000]  on my show.
[01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:21.000]  So that's coming up.
[01:34:21.000 --> 01:34:23.000]  I told the crew they pull that up.
[01:34:23.000 --> 01:34:25.000]  They are really, you had Christopher Walken on?
[01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:27.000]  Yeah, the show's been around a while, folks.
[01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:29.000]  And when I was anti-war,
[01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:31.000]  which I still am, and the big 9-11 guy
[01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:33.000]  I got invited out to Hollywood
[01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:35.000]  everywhere, met all those guys, and a lot more.
[01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:37.000]  But those are the good guys that were away.
[01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:39.000]  Most Hollywood was a bunch of scum,
[01:34:39.000 --> 01:34:41.000]  so I really never continued going out there.
[01:34:41.000 --> 01:34:43.000]  Going back to Chris Skye, great actress.
[01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:45.000]  Chris, tell folks how you're running for the mayor
[01:34:45.000 --> 01:34:47.000]  of Toronto.
[01:34:47.000 --> 01:34:49.000]  Then let's get into the latest on the poison shots
[01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:51.000]  and what your predicting is coming next with that.
[01:34:51.000 --> 01:34:53.000]  Well, I never considered
[01:34:53.000 --> 01:34:55.000]  public office in any way, shape, or form.
[01:34:55.000 --> 01:34:57.000]  But a series of events happened
[01:34:57.000 --> 01:34:59.000]  that basically had the universe
[01:34:59.000 --> 01:35:01.000]  thrust the opportunity into my face
[01:35:01.000 --> 01:35:03.000]  and tell me if you don't do it,
[01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:05.000]  there's something wrong with you. And I can explain.
[01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:07.000]  I
[01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:09.000]  split my time between Toronto and Alberta,
[01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:11.000]  but I've been a resident of Toronto
[01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:13.000]  for, like, 35 years.
[01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:15.000]  And John Tory was the mayor.
[01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:17.000]  He had to resign because he got caught in an affair.
[01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:19.000]  And so the mayor is now
[01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:21.000]  an open incumbent.
[01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:23.000]  And there's nobody to take
[01:35:23.000 --> 01:35:25.000]  his place, really. Nobody that
[01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:27.000]  I've ever heard of before.
[01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:29.000]  And I'm in a unique position
[01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:31.000]  because
[01:35:31.000 --> 01:35:33.000]  I was going to Toronto already for court.
[01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:35.000]  I had some really bad charges
[01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:37.000]  and there's all set up. I can't really talk
[01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:39.000]  about it very much because I still have one day left
[01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:41.000]  in trial, but I can tell you that the charges
[01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:43.000]  were threatening to kill all the premiers
[01:35:43.000 --> 01:35:45.000]  in Canada, which are the equivalent of your
[01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:47.000]  governors, and assault with deadly
[01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:49.000]  weapon on police officers.
[01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:51.000]  So I was told I had to go to Toronto
[01:35:51.000 --> 01:35:53.000]  for February 15th for court.
[01:35:53.000 --> 01:35:55.000]  And the Worldwide Rally was February 18th.
[01:35:55.000 --> 01:35:57.000]  So they asked me if I would come to the Worldwide Rally
[01:35:57.000 --> 01:35:59.000]  and speak. And we called
[01:35:59.000 --> 01:36:01.000]  the Worldwide Rally Reunite Ontario.
[01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:03.000]  I said no problem.
[01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:05.000]  Three days before I was going to Toronto,
[01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:07.000]  John Tory was forced to resign.
[01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:09.000]  He even knew he was supposed to resign.
[01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:11.000]  People started calling me and asked me if I'd be running
[01:36:11.000 --> 01:36:13.000]  for mayor. I said, what are you talking about?
[01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:15.000]  Why are you saying that? They told me because I was
[01:36:15.000 --> 01:36:17.000]  trending online. So I checked on Twitter and
[01:36:17.000 --> 01:36:19.000]  Google and sure enough, Chris Sky for mayor
[01:36:19.000 --> 01:36:21.000]  was trending before I even knew about it.
[01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:23.000]  So putting all that
[01:36:23.000 --> 01:36:25.000]  together, when I did get to Toronto, I had
[01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:27.000]  the ability,
[01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:29.000]  I was supposed to meet with this family
[01:36:29.000 --> 01:36:31.000]  of a little girl who had mental health problems
[01:36:31.000 --> 01:36:33.000]  that only manifested during COVID.
[01:36:33.000 --> 01:36:35.000]  And we were going to go visit her for her
[01:36:35.000 --> 01:36:37.000]  birthday. And unfortunately, when we got there
[01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:39.000]  on February 16th, she was in the hospital.
[01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:41.000]  So we had to visit her in the hospital.
[01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:43.000]  And I told, I've been
[01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:45.000]  saying this on video over and over. I'm sure you have clips
[01:36:45.000 --> 01:36:47.000]  of it where I said I would do anything in my power
[01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:49.000]  to make sure that they would never hurt children.
[01:36:49.000 --> 01:36:51.000]  And when I saw her sitting there and
[01:36:51.000 --> 01:36:53.000]  she said that the best gift she ever got was
[01:36:53.000 --> 01:36:55.000]  me coming to see her for her birthday.
[01:36:55.000 --> 01:36:57.000]  And she asked me if I'd
[01:36:57.000 --> 01:36:59.000]  be running for mayor. The only answer I could
[01:36:59.000 --> 01:37:01.000]  tell her was yes. So yesterday at the
[01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:03.000]  Worldwide Rally, I announced that I
[01:37:03.000 --> 01:37:05.000]  would be running for mayor of Toronto because
[01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:07.000]  they're going to be hosting a snap election that's
[01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:09.000]  probably going to be announced March 29th.
[01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:11.000]  I'm in a unique position and I believe
[01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:13.000]  I'm the best man for the job. And I'll tell you
[01:37:13.000 --> 01:37:15.000]  why. First of all, my background, Chris
[01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:17.000]  Sky, that name comes from Sky Homes Corporation.
[01:37:17.000 --> 01:37:19.000]  So for the last 20 plus years, I've
[01:37:19.000 --> 01:37:21.000]  been in professional, developed design
[01:37:21.000 --> 01:37:23.000]  and build. So I've been involved with the government
[01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:25.000]  and especially in the planning and development
[01:37:25.000 --> 01:37:27.000]  aspect of government from
[01:37:27.000 --> 01:37:29.000]  municipalities all over Ontario.
[01:37:29.000 --> 01:37:31.000]  So I'm more qualified than any of these politicians.
[01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:33.000]  Secondly,
[01:37:33.000 --> 01:37:35.000]  for all these politicians, it's a
[01:37:35.000 --> 01:37:37.000]  job, a career, a promotion.
[01:37:37.000 --> 01:37:39.000]  For me, it's a big sacrifice.
[01:37:39.000 --> 01:37:41.000]  My sacrifice, my family life,
[01:37:41.000 --> 01:37:43.000]  sacrifice my personal life, sacrifice
[01:37:43.000 --> 01:37:45.000]  my career to come and clean this swamp.
[01:37:45.000 --> 01:37:47.000]  Finally, I'm the only candidate
[01:37:47.000 --> 01:37:49.000]  that will stop the 15-minute
[01:37:49.000 --> 01:37:51.000]  cities, stop the carbon allowance.
[01:37:51.000 --> 01:37:53.000]  By the way, Canada
[01:37:53.000 --> 01:37:55.000]  has announced 15-minute cities all over.
[01:37:55.000 --> 01:37:57.000]  Oh, they've announced it everywhere.
[01:37:57.000 --> 01:37:59.000]  It's already in Toronto, it's already in Ottawa,
[01:37:59.000 --> 01:38:01.000]  it's already in Edmonton, it's already for Vancouver
[01:38:01.000 --> 01:38:03.000]  and they admit that it's about
[01:38:03.000 --> 01:38:05.000]  reducing vehicle traffic, they admit everything
[01:38:05.000 --> 01:38:07.000]  I said. So they basically...
[01:38:07.000 --> 01:38:09.000]  Well, I'm going to get behind you because regardless,
[01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:11.000]  you got a good chance to win, you're so popular.
[01:38:11.000 --> 01:38:13.000]  He's well-known in the U.S. that people really love him in Canada.
[01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:15.000]  You'll be able to educate people
[01:38:15.000 --> 01:38:17.000]  and you'll be able to inject real issues into the campaign.
[01:38:17.000 --> 01:38:19.000]  So it's a win-win-win, no matter if you win
[01:38:19.000 --> 01:38:21.000]  or not, and you want people to go to your
[01:38:21.000 --> 01:38:23.000]  email, you want people to sign up at your email so you can
[01:38:23.000 --> 01:38:25.000]  contact them, communicate with them, give people
[01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:27.000]  the email.
[01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:29.000]  So we started an email campaign.
[01:38:29.000 --> 01:38:31.000]  Any Canadian, it's not a campaign for
[01:38:31.000 --> 01:38:33.000]  mayor, this is the campaign.
[01:38:33.000 --> 01:38:35.000]  So I'll be able to run for mayor because I'm going to
[01:38:35.000 --> 01:38:37.000]  have to put everything else aside in my life.
[01:38:37.000 --> 01:38:39.000]  So we created an email, it is
[01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:41.000]  chrissky4change
[01:38:41.000 --> 01:38:43.000]  at mail.com and any Canadian
[01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:45.000]  can send an e-transfer of support to that
[01:38:45.000 --> 01:38:47.000]  email. Any American or international
[01:38:47.000 --> 01:38:49.000]  supporter can email that email
[01:38:49.000 --> 01:38:51.000]  and find out how they can support this
[01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:53.000]  when I get elected
[01:38:53.000 --> 01:38:55.000]  and I will get elected. And first of all,
[01:38:55.000 --> 01:38:57.000]  I'm the only political candidate
[01:38:57.000 --> 01:38:59.000]  where you can Google Chris Sky's cell
[01:38:59.000 --> 01:39:01.000]  phone number and it'll come up
[01:39:01.000 --> 01:39:03.000]  416-400-9994
[01:39:03.000 --> 01:39:05.000]  and when I
[01:39:05.000 --> 01:39:07.000]  get elected, that number will still be
[01:39:07.000 --> 01:39:09.000]  public. It does not go to an office,
[01:39:09.000 --> 01:39:11.000]  it does not go to an assistant, it does not
[01:39:11.000 --> 01:39:13.000]  go to a voicemail, it comes to me.
[01:39:13.000 --> 01:39:15.000]  And I spend at least 21
[01:39:15.000 --> 01:39:17.000]  hours a day awake, that's my wife, I don't sleep
[01:39:17.000 --> 01:39:19.000]  3 hours a day and the rest of those
[01:39:19.000 --> 01:39:21.000]  hours I'm on my phone
[01:39:21.000 --> 01:39:23.000]  and I'm answering calls and I'm trying to help
[01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:25.000]  people any way I can.
[01:39:25.000 --> 01:39:27.000]  Give the email out again.
[01:39:27.000 --> 01:39:29.000]  I'm sorry?
[01:39:29.000 --> 01:39:31.000]  Give the email out again.
[01:39:31.000 --> 01:39:33.000]  It's chrissky4change
[01:39:33.000 --> 01:39:35.000]  at mail.com
[01:39:35.000 --> 01:39:37.000]  chrissky4change
[01:39:37.000 --> 01:39:39.000]  at mail.com
[01:39:39.000 --> 01:39:41.000]  Okay, great, I'm glad we'll follow
[01:39:41.000 --> 01:39:43.000]  it, we're told you're going to be back on the show
[01:39:43.000 --> 01:39:45.000]  this coming Friday to get more into all this
[01:39:45.000 --> 01:39:47.000]  but let's get into the poison shot, where they are
[01:39:47.000 --> 01:39:49.000]  they're admitting they want to bring it back, the
[01:39:49.000 --> 01:39:51.000]  UN's hyping Marburg that kills 90%
[01:39:51.000 --> 01:39:53.000]  of people they claim.
[01:39:53.000 --> 01:39:55.000]  You've got a good crystal ball on this, what's coming next?
[01:39:55.000 --> 01:39:57.000]  It's terrifying, well first of all
[01:39:57.000 --> 01:39:59.000]  we already saw that we have massive uprise
[01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:01.000]  and other infections because the children
[01:40:01.000 --> 01:40:03.000]  have their immune systems compromised.
[01:40:03.000 --> 01:40:05.000]  A, from wearing masks, B, from being
[01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:07.000]  isolated, and C, from getting, giving these poison injections.
[01:40:07.000 --> 01:40:09.000]  We had this whole triple
[01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:11.000]  demic where they had the flu that came back
[01:40:11.000 --> 01:40:13.000]  after nobody had the flu for almost two years.
[01:40:13.000 --> 01:40:15.000]  RSV virus which
[01:40:15.000 --> 01:40:17.000]  is a very common virus that every parent
[01:40:17.000 --> 01:40:19.000]  goes through, became this new scary thing.
[01:40:19.000 --> 01:40:21.000]  And then they had the monkey pox scare.
[01:40:21.000 --> 01:40:23.000]  They really were just trying to see any way
[01:40:23.000 --> 01:40:25.000]  they could scare the public back into submissions
[01:40:25.000 --> 01:40:27.000]  back into mandates. But now we have
[01:40:27.000 --> 01:40:29.000]  to worry about two very scary things.
[01:40:29.000 --> 01:40:31.000]  But number one, the Marburg virus in New Guinea.
[01:40:31.000 --> 01:40:33.000]  First of all, it happened under very
[01:40:33.000 --> 01:40:35.000]  suspicious circumstances. Researchers
[01:40:35.000 --> 01:40:37.000]  were working with monkeys and they all
[01:40:37.000 --> 01:40:39.000]  mysteriously got infected
[01:40:39.000 --> 01:40:41.000]  and just in time for them to test a brand
[01:40:41.000 --> 01:40:43.000]  new mRNA Marburg vaccine.
[01:40:43.000 --> 01:40:45.000]  Very, very suspicious
[01:40:45.000 --> 01:40:47.000]  and Marburg vaccine is not a joke
[01:40:47.000 --> 01:40:49.000]  it has about a 90% kill rate.
[01:40:49.000 --> 01:40:51.000]  So this is very dangerous. Then
[01:40:51.000 --> 01:40:53.000]  they're talking about bird flu, avian flu
[01:40:53.000 --> 01:40:55.000]  and they said it has already
[01:40:55.000 --> 01:40:57.000]  jumped to mammals which is extremely
[01:40:57.000 --> 01:40:59.000]  scary. COVID had over
[01:40:59.000 --> 01:41:01.000]  a 99% survival rate.
[01:41:01.000 --> 01:41:03.000]  Avian flu is 50-50.
[01:41:03.000 --> 01:41:05.000]  That means you got a one and two chance
[01:41:05.000 --> 01:41:07.000]  of dying if you contract this.
[01:41:07.000 --> 01:41:09.000]  It usually only flows through birds
[01:41:09.000 --> 01:41:11.000]  but now they're seeing that it's
[01:41:11.000 --> 01:41:13.000]  manifesting into other animals.
[01:41:13.000 --> 01:41:15.000]  And all of this is right on time as the UN tries to get
[01:41:15.000 --> 01:41:17.000]  their world treating into taking control of our bodies.
[01:41:17.000 --> 01:41:19.000]  Very scary indeed.
[01:41:19.000 --> 01:41:21.000]  It's almost like they want to scare
[01:41:21.000 --> 01:41:23.000]  people so much that people
[01:41:23.000 --> 01:41:25.000]  will simply give up their right to bodily
[01:41:25.000 --> 01:41:27.000]  autonomy and allow it to be attached
[01:41:27.000 --> 01:41:29.000]  to a so-called digital currency.
[01:41:29.000 --> 01:41:31.000]  In Canada, they're trying to push the universal
[01:41:31.000 --> 01:41:33.000]  basic income very hard and you know what they're
[01:41:33.000 --> 01:41:35.000]  doing to do it? They know every
[01:41:35.000 --> 01:41:37.000]  country's weakness and in Canada
[01:41:37.000 --> 01:41:39.000]  besides being too nice and tolerant
[01:41:39.000 --> 01:41:41.000]  our financial weakness is
[01:41:41.000 --> 01:41:43.000]  Canadians love to live in a nice big
[01:41:43.000 --> 01:41:45.000]  comfy home. They spend way too much
[01:41:45.000 --> 01:41:47.000]  of their monthly bills on their mortgage.
[01:41:47.000 --> 01:41:49.000]  So what did the government do?
[01:41:49.000 --> 01:41:51.000]  They raised interest rates like four times
[01:41:51.000 --> 01:41:53.000]  to the point where some people are paying
[01:41:53.000 --> 01:41:55.000]  double on their mortgage. Some people are paying
[01:41:55.000 --> 01:41:57.000]  so much on their mortgage that they're underwater on their house.
[01:41:57.000 --> 01:41:59.000]  In fact, within another
[01:41:59.000 --> 01:42:01.000]  six months, if 30-40%
[01:42:01.000 --> 01:42:03.000]  of Canadians are going to have to either sell
[01:42:03.000 --> 01:42:05.000]  their house or downsize in some way,
[01:42:05.000 --> 01:42:07.000]  how nice would it be for the government to come
[01:42:07.000 --> 01:42:09.000]  in with a wonderful homeowner savings
[01:42:09.000 --> 01:42:11.000]  program where they're going to give you so
[01:42:11.000 --> 01:42:13.000]  much money a month
[01:42:13.000 --> 01:42:15.000]  to save your home, but all you're going to have to
[01:42:15.000 --> 01:42:17.000]  do is submit to the digital identity, the iris scan,
[01:42:17.000 --> 01:42:19.000]  the fingerprint, the
[01:42:19.000 --> 01:42:21.000]  DNA sample and of course the mandatory
[01:42:21.000 --> 01:42:23.000]  vaccinations and the digital ID.
[01:42:23.000 --> 01:42:25.000]  So that's the cheese on the mouth trap.
[01:42:25.000 --> 01:42:27.000]  That's right.
[01:42:27.000 --> 01:42:29.000]  They're going to bait the trap
[01:42:29.000 --> 01:42:31.000]  in every way possible.
[01:42:31.000 --> 01:42:33.000]  For the low-low income, they're going to sell
[01:42:33.000 --> 01:42:35.000]  the 15-minute cities on the idea that you
[01:42:35.000 --> 01:42:37.000]  couldn't own a car anyway, you couldn't own
[01:42:37.000 --> 01:42:39.000]  a house anyway, so this is great.
[01:42:39.000 --> 01:42:41.000]  For the 15-minute cities, ask them to show you
[01:42:41.000 --> 01:42:43.000]  the renderings where the cars are.
[01:42:43.000 --> 01:42:45.000]  Ask them to show you the renderings where the single family
[01:42:45.000 --> 01:42:47.000]  cars are. Well, they admit there won't be cars, and again,
[01:42:47.000 --> 01:42:49.000]  you'll own nothing to be happy, Claude Schwab said.
[01:42:49.000 --> 01:42:51.000]  Final segment with Chris Sky, also the
[01:42:51.000 --> 01:42:53.000]  Richard Belzer clip, and more, stay with us
[01:42:53.000 --> 01:42:55.000]  and then Owen Schroder takes over in 15 minutes.
[01:42:59.000 --> 01:43:01.000]  The cavalry has arrived.
[01:43:01.000 --> 01:43:03.000]  Ultimate bone broth
[01:43:03.000 --> 01:43:05.000]  is the strongest, highest quality
[01:43:05.000 --> 01:43:07.000]  chicken-based bone broth
[01:43:07.000 --> 01:43:09.000]  you're going to find with all of the effects
[01:43:09.000 --> 01:43:11.000]  for your joints, your bones, your muscles,
[01:43:11.000 --> 01:43:13.000]  your heart, but more importantly,
[01:43:13.000 --> 01:43:15.000]  your immune system. Everybody
[01:43:15.000 --> 01:43:17.000]  knows about grandma and chicken broth.
[01:43:17.000 --> 01:43:19.000]  Well, this is concentrated chicken broth,
[01:43:19.000 --> 01:43:21.000]  the strongest out there with
[01:43:21.000 --> 01:43:23.000]  chocolate mushroom, and a whole
[01:43:23.000 --> 01:43:25.000]  bunch of other ingredients, like turmeric,
[01:43:25.000 --> 01:43:27.000]  the list goes on and on. This is definitely
[01:43:27.000 --> 01:43:29.000]  the strongest, best bone
[01:43:29.000 --> 01:43:31.000]  broth out there, and your purchase
[01:43:31.000 --> 01:43:33.000]  supports the M4, a 360
[01:43:33.000 --> 01:43:35.000]  win. If you've not experienced bone broth,
[01:43:35.000 --> 01:43:37.000]  and even the regular ones have great effects,
[01:43:37.000 --> 01:43:39.000]  believe me, you want to get
[01:43:39.000 --> 01:43:41.000]  M4 Wars Live Ultimate Bone Broth

[01:43:59.000 --> 01:44:01.000]  M4 Wars is winning.
[01:44:01.000 --> 01:44:03.000]  M4 Wars is reaching more people than ever.
[01:44:03.000 --> 01:44:05.000]  We were supposed to be off the air months and months
[01:44:05.000 --> 01:44:07.000]  and months ago, mainstream media told you,
[01:44:07.000 --> 01:44:09.000]  but it's not true. They told
[01:44:09.000 --> 01:44:11.000]  you we were going to be shut down. They told
[01:44:11.000 --> 01:44:13.000]  you we owed a billion and a half dollars. None of
[01:44:13.000 --> 01:44:15.000]  that's true. It's all being appealed.
[01:44:15.000 --> 01:44:17.000]  They want you to think M4 Wars is dead.
[01:44:17.000 --> 01:44:19.000]  But if you simply stand up and support
[01:44:19.000 --> 01:44:21.000]  M4 Wars, we've got years and years
[01:44:21.000 --> 01:44:23.000]  of appeals, and we will not be taking
[01:44:23.000 --> 01:44:25.000]  off the air. But if they can convince you
[01:44:25.000 --> 01:44:27.000]  that we've been shut down, they're going to win.
[01:44:27.000 --> 01:44:29.000]  Don't let the globalist
[01:44:29.000 --> 01:44:31.000]  sigh up you and your family. Go to

[01:44:37.000 --> 01:44:39.000]  your life and let the globalist know
[01:44:39.000 --> 01:44:41.000]  their sigh up has not worked. Thanks for

[01:44:47.000 --> 01:44:49.000]  that can take us off the air is you,
[01:44:49.000 --> 01:44:51.000]  the viewers and listeners. The majority
[01:44:51.000 --> 01:44:53.000]  of you have not been sigh up. But some of
[01:44:53.000 --> 01:44:55.000]  you have. Do not let the globalist
[01:44:55.000 --> 01:44:57.000]  brainwash you. Go to M4WarsHore.com
[01:44:57.000 --> 01:44:59.000]  to keep us on the air.
[01:44:59.000 --> 01:45:01.000]  Do you want to beat the new world order?
[01:45:01.000 --> 01:45:03.000]  Do you want to stop their globalist agenda?
[01:45:03.000 --> 01:45:05.000]  Well, so do I. And I've been the most
[01:45:05.000 --> 01:45:07.000]  affected individual in the fight
[01:45:07.000 --> 01:45:09.000]  against the globalist, and I've got their number
[01:45:09.000 --> 01:45:11.000]  and I know how to bring them down. But ladies
[01:45:11.000 --> 01:45:13.000]  and gentlemen, I can't do it
[01:45:13.000 --> 01:45:15.000]  without your support. And
[01:45:15.000 --> 01:45:17.000]  the good news is we're only under
[01:45:17.000 --> 01:45:19.000]  about $200,000 a month.
[01:45:19.000 --> 01:45:21.000]  The bad news is the enemy is
[01:45:21.000 --> 01:45:23.000]  intensifying their attacks on every front,
[01:45:23.000 --> 01:45:25.000]  but I'm not going to back down, and I'll never give up,
[01:45:25.000 --> 01:45:27.000]  but I could give out. So please keep me
[01:45:27.000 --> 01:45:29.000]  on the front lines against the enemy
[01:45:29.000 --> 01:45:31.000]  while getting great products at the same time
[01:45:31.000 --> 01:45:33.000]  that will empower you and your family.

[01:45:41.000 --> 01:45:43.000]  goes towards the fight, not part of it
[01:45:43.000 --> 01:45:45.000]  going towards product cost. But I thank you all
[01:45:45.000 --> 01:45:47.000]  for your support. Please commit now

[01:45:51.000 --> 01:45:53.000]  Now take action. The globalist
[01:45:53.000 --> 01:45:57.000]  are counting on you not taking action.
[01:45:59.000 --> 01:46:01.000]  There is a war on for your mind.
[01:46:01.000 --> 01:46:03.000]  Your mind is a battlefield.
[01:46:03.000 --> 01:46:05.000]  This is an information war.
[01:46:05.000 --> 01:46:07.000]  M4Wars popularized those
[01:46:07.000 --> 01:46:09.000]  terms more than two decades ago.
[01:46:09.000 --> 01:46:11.000]  And today, whether it's Donald Trump
[01:46:11.000 --> 01:46:13.000]  or Governor DeSantis
[01:46:13.000 --> 01:46:15.000]  or Dr. Robert Malone, they're all
[01:46:15.000 --> 01:46:17.000]  using the terms that M4Wars
[01:46:17.000 --> 01:46:19.000]  has popularized because
[01:46:19.000 --> 01:46:21.000]  we understand the enemy's operations
[01:46:21.000 --> 01:46:23.000]  and we know how to beat them. But we can't
[01:46:23.000 --> 01:46:25.000]  do it without funding. And we make it easy
[01:46:25.000 --> 01:46:27.000]  to fund with great products and power
[01:46:27.000 --> 01:46:29.000]  you and your immune system and your family
[01:46:29.000 --> 01:46:31.000]  as well. You can also make straight donations
[01:46:31.000 --> 01:46:33.000]  at M4WarsHore.com, clicking on the
[01:46:33.000 --> 01:46:35.000]  Big Red Banner, a one-time or recurring.
[01:46:35.000 --> 01:46:37.000]  But I'm asking you to take action. We're
[01:46:37.000 --> 01:46:39.000]  non-violent. But every time you donate
[01:46:39.000 --> 01:46:41.000]  money, every time you buy products, every time you keep
[01:46:41.000 --> 01:46:43.000]  us on air, you are literally non-violently
[01:46:43.000 --> 01:46:45.000]  politically punching the new world order
[01:46:45.000 --> 01:46:47.000]  in the nose, punching their lies
[01:46:47.000 --> 01:46:49.000]  in the nose. We are going to defeat
[01:46:49.000 --> 01:46:51.000]  the new world order. We're going over the top
[01:46:51.000 --> 01:46:53.000]  and right now is a critical juncture. So please
[01:46:53.000 --> 01:46:55.000]  go to M4WarsHore.com
[01:46:55.000 --> 01:46:57.000]  and donate now.
[01:47:01.000 --> 01:47:03.000]  Leading a frontal assault
[01:47:03.000 --> 01:47:05.000]  on the lies of the New World Order
[01:47:05.000 --> 01:47:21.000]  it's Alex Jones.
[01:47:35.000 --> 01:47:37.000]  Alright, final segment with the great Chris
[01:47:37.000 --> 01:47:39.000]  Skye. I'm Alex Jones, your host, and I'll
[01:47:39.000 --> 01:47:41.000]  enjoy your takeover.
[01:47:41.000 --> 01:47:43.000]  The next two hours, 6 to 8 p.m.
[01:47:43.000 --> 01:47:45.000]  Central ahead of
[01:47:45.000 --> 01:47:47.000]  Harrison Smith, 8 a.m. tomorrow
[01:47:47.000 --> 01:47:49.000]  at M4WarsHore.com.
[01:47:49.000 --> 01:47:51.000]  It's our show, and it takes us across the
[01:47:51.000 --> 01:47:53.000]  country, and it looks like we're going to
[01:47:53.000 --> 01:47:55.000]  have a great time.
[01:47:55.000 --> 01:47:57.000]  We're going to have a great time.
[01:47:57.000 --> 01:47:59.000]  We're going to have a great time.
[01:47:59.000 --> 01:48:01.000]  We're going to have a great time.
[01:48:01.000 --> 01:48:03.000]  We're going to have a great time.
[01:48:03.000 --> 01:48:05.000]  And the show is taking place.
[01:48:05.000 --> 01:48:07.000]  It takes us across the country, and at 11 a.m.
[01:48:07.000 --> 01:48:09.000]  I'll go live again with some big guests
[01:48:09.000 --> 01:48:11.000]  and more breaking news tomorrow.
[01:48:11.000 --> 01:48:13.000]  Chris, you have a great mindset.
[01:48:13.000 --> 01:48:15.000]  You know how to break their conditioning.
[01:48:15.000 --> 01:48:17.000]  You know they want us depressed and out of the game.
[01:48:17.000 --> 01:48:19.000]  You're one of the best when it comes to not just
[01:48:19.000 --> 01:48:21.000]  predicting the future and tracking the enemies'
[01:48:21.000 --> 01:48:23.000]  operations, because if you're a great business
[01:48:23.000 --> 01:48:25.000]  background in research and acumen, but also
[01:48:25.000 --> 01:48:27.000]  in getting people fired up to be positive,
[01:48:27.000 --> 01:48:29.000]  that's a problem I have getting too close
[01:48:29.000 --> 01:48:31.000]  to this and staring into the abyss.
[01:48:31.000 --> 01:48:36.280]  your great advice to all the viewers and listeners. Well, this is a two-step process. First of all,
[01:48:36.280 --> 01:48:42.280]  I stay positive because as long as I stay positive, they cannot affect me. As soon as you're negative,
[01:48:42.280 --> 01:48:47.400]  you're taken out of the game. First, we have to wake people up. Everybody's afraid, everybody's
[01:48:47.400 --> 01:48:55.240]  confused. But when people realize that everything, COVID, 15-minute city, carbon tax, all of that
[01:48:55.240 --> 01:49:00.600]  is about power and control for the government while using fear and confusion to null you into
[01:49:00.600 --> 01:49:05.800]  submission. When people realize that it has nothing to do with health and safety, they're awake.
[01:49:05.800 --> 01:49:11.960]  That's step one. Now the problem is the government knows I'm great at waking people up. They know
[01:49:11.960 --> 01:49:17.080]  we're great at waking people up. So what do they do? Once those people are awake, they bombard you
[01:49:17.080 --> 01:49:22.680]  with negativity and they try to overwhelm you with so many things coming at you that you feel
[01:49:22.680 --> 01:49:27.560]  paralyzed and you don't want to fight back. And in fact, when you're in that negative mindset,
[01:49:27.560 --> 01:49:31.640]  you cannot even connect with others. I can give you a perfect example. When I say things like
[01:49:31.640 --> 01:49:36.920]  the men in Canada need to step up and be more manly, the ones in a negative mindset will say,
[01:49:36.920 --> 01:49:41.160]  wow, Chris Sky is attacking me. He's an asshole. I'm not going to listen to him. The ones in a
[01:49:41.160 --> 01:49:47.560]  positive mindset have activated their individual power and they'll be ready to accept that message
[01:49:47.560 --> 01:49:54.440]  and connect with others, amplifying their power. So you need to get yourself into a positive mindset
[01:49:54.440 --> 01:49:58.600]  and then you can connect with other people of the positive mindset. And when you have a whole
[01:49:58.600 --> 01:50:07.880]  bunch of people ready and willing to just say, no, we call that United non-compliance. And that
[01:50:07.880 --> 01:50:15.160]  is the single perfect solution to every single problem that they try to force upon you.
[01:50:15.720 --> 01:50:22.120]  A whole group of people simply not going along with it. And how do you do that? You wake them up,
[01:50:22.120 --> 01:50:27.000]  let them know what's really going on. You activate their positive energy so they understand that
[01:50:27.000 --> 01:50:32.520]  they are an individual with a little bit of power and then you connect them with other positive
[01:50:32.520 --> 01:50:39.640]  like-minded individuals with the same thoughts for freedom. And you know what happens? You get a
[01:50:39.640 --> 01:50:47.240]  worldwide movement that transcends borders. It transcends language. It transcends psychological
[01:50:47.240 --> 01:50:54.520]  programming and it cannot be undone. And that's what we have right now. We have them reacting
[01:50:54.520 --> 01:51:02.360]  literally in real time to the things that we say and do. And the UN and the big corporations
[01:51:02.360 --> 01:51:07.800]  saying arrest us, silence us, they are desperate. They've got less than a 7% of purple rating
[01:51:07.800 --> 01:51:12.680]  internationally. The New World Order is being identified. We are spotlighting the cockroaches.
[01:51:12.680 --> 01:51:16.600]  How big was that to have Elon Musk come out against the New World Order? Suddenly Joe Rogan
[01:51:16.600 --> 01:51:21.800]  knows all about the New World Order. He's speaking out against it. Again, we have to be ready for
[01:51:21.800 --> 01:51:26.200]  these pop icons to join us. People can't be mad that they didn't join us previously. They're
[01:51:26.200 --> 01:51:31.960]  joining now because now that they can save, which is fine. Yes, that's a very good point. You have
[01:51:31.960 --> 01:51:36.280]  to take your allies where you can find them. You cannot ostracize people. I have so many people
[01:51:36.280 --> 01:51:40.680]  have perfect examples. You can't trust the police. There's lots of police you can't trust, but there's
[01:51:40.680 --> 01:51:45.800]  some amazing police you can. And you need to take your allies where you can get them, especially in
[01:51:45.800 --> 01:51:51.000]  law enforcement and government positions. They want to divide us. I found a lot of people in
[01:51:51.000 --> 01:51:55.880]  government are more awake in the public. They're just compartmentalized. Exactly. And they're too
[01:51:55.880 --> 01:52:00.280]  afraid to speak out because they believe they have a lot more to lose. But in reality, we all
[01:52:00.280 --> 01:52:05.160]  have the same thing to lose. We all have our freedom to lose. We all have our opportunity to lose.
[01:52:05.160 --> 01:52:11.000]  And we all have that to lose not just for ourselves, but for generations to come. And I for one,
[01:52:11.000 --> 01:52:15.320]  will not be the kind of man that walks around 10 years from now looking youth in the eyes
[01:52:15.320 --> 01:52:20.440]  and saying, well, I did everything I could to help, but it wasn't good enough. No, I'm going to do
[01:52:20.440 --> 01:52:26.840]  everything in my power and things that aren't even in my power to ensure that their plans fall flat
[01:52:26.840 --> 01:52:32.680]  on their face. And it's inevitable because as long as there's warriors like you and me and millions
[01:52:32.680 --> 01:52:37.800]  of others, they can never win, Alex. They can never win. Absolutely. Plus, when people know
[01:52:37.800 --> 01:52:41.640]  giving into the new world order only makes it worse, you're going to have to completely roll over
[01:52:41.640 --> 01:52:45.960]  and have your way of life and you're probably your physical life destroyed. Or you can say,
[01:52:45.960 --> 01:52:49.480]  by increments, I'm going to get informed. I'm going to inform others and I'm going to stop
[01:52:49.480 --> 01:52:53.800]  submitting to the new world order. You're joining us coming up on the Friday show,
[01:52:53.800 --> 01:52:59.480]  hearing about five days from now. Chris Sky, people can find you at realchrissky.com on

[01:53:05.080 --> 01:53:09.400]  that second segment you were on was, I mean, the crew was clapping. They always liked the show.
[01:53:09.400 --> 01:53:13.880]  They were saying, man, that was powerful. Amazing job, Chris Sky. We'll talk to you again, my friend.
[01:53:15.320 --> 01:53:20.680]  Thank you, guys. God bless you. All right. Well, this was a great Sunday show. Owens loaded for
[01:53:20.680 --> 01:53:25.560]  Bear as well. Big developments on the whole train development. A derailment. They've found pipe bombs
[01:53:25.560 --> 01:53:31.160]  now. And the locals are saying a week before FEMA came in. And so we want you to all wear these
[01:53:31.160 --> 01:53:36.840]  armbands during a coming emergency. This is mainstream news. So this is looking worse and

[01:54:31.400 --> 01:54:37.480]  you know, I talked to a lot off air, a good send-off. He invited me to France, he invited me
[01:54:37.480 --> 01:54:41.480]  when he was out in LA and I was always so busy I could never go hang out with him. I wish I would
[01:54:41.480 --> 01:54:47.880]  have, but comedian, law and order icon, Richard Belzer, very popular trailblazing comedian at
[01:54:48.680 --> 01:54:55.320]  78 years old, died at his home in southwest France. Cause is not known, but his old friend said that
[01:54:55.320 --> 01:54:59.880]  he'd been having a lot of health problems. But the coolest thing ever happened with him
[01:54:59.880 --> 01:55:05.160]  is he said, Hey, I want to come on next week. I'm going to be having Christopher Walken over
[01:55:05.160 --> 01:55:09.800]  to my house to cook chicken and drink some wine. You ought to come up here. He was on the east
[01:55:09.800 --> 01:55:15.480]  coast, some farmhouse. I said, man, I can't do it. I'd love to meet Christopher Walken. He's a
[01:55:15.480 --> 01:55:18.840]  great actor. And then sure enough, he comes on the show the next week and all of a sudden,
[01:55:18.840 --> 01:55:23.640]  Christopher Walken comes in and sits on his lap as a joke. And he was going to be on for longer,
[01:55:23.640 --> 01:55:27.880]  but he didn't want to hear about 9 11 and the new world order. He wanted to have a non political
[01:55:27.880 --> 01:55:32.600]  discussion. But here's part of that. We'll get the full interview tomorrow and re upload it to
[01:55:32.600 --> 01:55:38.680]  band out video to give Richard Belzer a good send off. But here's a little snippet of one of our
[01:55:38.680 --> 01:55:43.960]  more interesting interviews. Chris, what is what is your view on what's happening in the world right
[01:55:43.960 --> 01:55:52.600]  now with the with the TSA and the growth and the surveillance grid? I was a hearing that you don't
[01:55:52.600 --> 01:55:59.240]  have all the little spy gadgets in your house. I envy that. I have no idea. And I hardly read the
[01:55:59.240 --> 01:56:05.160]  house. Chris does not. I cook, read the new Richard just gave me his book. I'm going to read it.
[01:56:05.160 --> 01:56:11.640]  Yeah, he'll read my book. Thank God. It's a history book. But Chris is I'm working with Richard on
[01:56:11.640 --> 01:56:16.440]  the cooking book to me. That's right. We're going to do something together. But Chris is brilliant
[01:56:16.440 --> 01:56:21.560]  because he doesn't want to be on the Google map and he doesn't want his phone to be have that
[01:56:21.560 --> 01:56:25.960]  reverse technology that we all know when it's off, you know where we are. And he's one of the few
[01:56:25.960 --> 01:56:31.240]  people I know and on the earth that has managed to do that. I mean, we have to do it. We're in
[01:56:31.240 --> 01:56:34.920]  media, but you know, he can go to a movie set, they give him a phone that he can throw away when
[01:56:34.920 --> 01:56:40.440]  it's over. When he does a play, it's the coolest. I mean, they only give me the phone so that they
[01:56:40.440 --> 01:56:46.760]  can know where he is, but he's going away. My radio slash TV show. And we're almost invading you
[01:56:46.760 --> 01:56:51.960]  right now like an alien probe. I know I was taking a nap and Richard called me out. Yeah, I am.
[01:56:54.120 --> 01:57:00.520]  This is unbelievable. But but Mr. Walken, what do you think of the whole announcement of that
[01:57:00.520 --> 01:57:04.120]  they want to have an Iran war? Do you think that's a bad idea about them?
[01:57:06.040 --> 01:57:11.800]  You gotta nap, Alex. All right. Thank you so much, Mr. Walken. All right. All right. Thanks. All
[01:57:11.800 --> 01:57:20.120]  right. I'm sorry, Richard, that I brought up serious subjects. No. Calling back. Let's ask
[01:57:20.120 --> 01:57:26.440]  him his favorite recipe with truffles. Ask him that. All right, folks, that's it for my broadcast.
[01:57:26.440 --> 01:57:31.080]  The full interview was more walking. We'll be uploaded to Band-Aid video tomorrow, maybe even
[01:57:31.080 --> 01:57:35.800]  tonight. I'm going to go to break here. And when I come back, oh, Troyer in two minutes, we sit in
[01:57:35.800 --> 01:57:39.960]  this chair that a big broadcast, please join him and please share the links. That's how we override
[01:57:39.960 --> 01:57:44.120]  the censors. Great job, Chris Sky. Amazing job through. Let's pray to try to end World War
[01:57:44.120 --> 01:57:45.960]  Three. Stay with us. We'll be right back.

[01:59:22.600 --> 01:59:26.360]  they've got to get through us first. These monsters are all over television wanting to give

[01:59:30.200 --> 01:59:35.480]  the chart. 80 plus percent increase in miscarriages in the first two prime ministers after these
[01:59:35.480 --> 01:59:41.640]  poison shots. We can and will save the children and they are counting on us. Let's do it together.
[01:59:41.640 --> 02:00:01.320]  And the fight starts at M4sword.com and the fight continues with your financial support at M4sword.com.
