[00:00.000 --> 00:07.000]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[00:31.000 --> 00:36.000]  Boy, I gotta tell you, getting older is not fun.
[00:36.000 --> 00:41.000]  I'm 45, have great health, really don't ever get sick other than allergies.
[00:41.000 --> 00:48.000]  But I've just been too busy to get my 100% blown Achilles fixed.
[00:48.000 --> 00:52.000]  I had scans done about a year ago, but never had the surgeries.
[00:52.000 --> 00:55.000]  It'll be seven weeks off, I waited too long.
[00:55.000 --> 01:02.000]  But it's 100% blown and I just get so busy that I've stopped working out.
[01:02.000 --> 01:06.000]  So about a month ago, I started working out again.
[01:06.000 --> 01:12.000]  And the supplements have helped me not balloon up to where I was six, seven years ago.
[01:12.000 --> 01:14.000]  That exercise all the time, I wouldn't lose weight.
[01:14.000 --> 01:21.000]  And it was the X2, it was no vitality that helped me feel like I was 20 again and lose 60 something pounds.
[01:21.000 --> 01:24.000]  Now I've crept back and gained like 30 of that back.
[01:24.000 --> 01:27.000]  That's to my next story.
[01:27.000 --> 01:30.000]  So I started hitting the gym four days a week.
[01:30.000 --> 01:33.000]  Instead of just doing a little bit of elliptical here and there.
[01:33.000 --> 01:36.000]  And man, I was like, you know what, I'm gonna not play around here.
[01:36.000 --> 01:38.000]  I'm gonna do like I used to when I was 20.
[01:38.000 --> 01:41.000]  I'm gonna do heavier weight after I warmed up.
[01:41.000 --> 01:46.000]  And I was gonna make myself, you know, do 30 reps or whatever on biceps.
[01:46.000 --> 01:48.000]  I never really do arms.
[01:48.000 --> 01:50.000]  And like I should.
[01:50.000 --> 01:52.000]  And man, oh my gosh.
[01:52.000 --> 01:54.000]  I'm pulling that weight up.
[01:54.000 --> 01:58.000]  And just, you could feel it just tear.
[01:58.000 --> 02:02.000]  And my bicep is just, it looks like half the size.
[02:02.000 --> 02:04.000]  By the way, it's just blown.
[02:04.000 --> 02:07.000]  So I'm here on air and you can't drag me away from it.
[02:07.000 --> 02:09.000]  And that's not the address.
[02:09.000 --> 02:11.000]  I should be in a sling.
[02:11.000 --> 02:13.000]  And I got a nice concierge doctor coming by.
[02:13.000 --> 02:15.000]  It's a great thing about free market society.
[02:15.000 --> 02:20.000]  I got a doctor, great, you know, medical doctor, orthopedic doctor.
[02:20.000 --> 02:25.000]  Did a great surgery on my wife's elbow from her tennis elbow.
[02:25.000 --> 02:27.000]  And boy, I'd say she's out of pain.
[02:27.000 --> 02:29.000]  She's had the surgery about a month ago.
[02:29.000 --> 02:33.000]  But I'm only telling the story right now because I usually prepare for the show.
[02:33.000 --> 02:39.000]  I did prepare last night and some this morning, but I've done zero preparation since I got here.
[02:39.000 --> 02:44.000]  And sometimes we have our best broadcast when that is the case.
[02:44.000 --> 02:48.000]  But if you see me jolting or pulling back or doing anything like that,
[02:48.000 --> 02:54.000]  it's because I keep forgetting that I cannot straighten my arm.
[02:54.000 --> 02:57.000]  It's like a cattle prod if I try to straighten it.
[02:57.000 --> 03:01.000]  So this should be interesting today because I'm like, I keep forgetting to close the, you know, close the car door,
[03:01.000 --> 03:05.000]  try to drive with two hands or, and I just can't do it.
[03:05.000 --> 03:07.000]  And I can't lower my hand down by my side.
[03:07.000 --> 03:11.000]  So let me tell you, a bicep injury is not a fun thing.
[03:11.000 --> 03:16.000]  I've had a few injuries and I've powered through them.
[03:16.000 --> 03:20.000]  But I think this is going to, I'm not going to wait on the surgery for this one.
[03:20.000 --> 03:23.000]  I need to have surgery because this is just unbelievable.
[03:23.000 --> 03:28.000]  But most people say they say most, most bicep injuries just heal themselves in six, six weeks or so.
[03:28.000 --> 03:32.000]  We'll see if that is the case.
[03:32.000 --> 03:35.000]  How excruciating this pain gets.
[03:35.000 --> 03:38.000]  But I'm just, I'm a little bit older these days.
[03:38.000 --> 03:42.000]  So I'm going to not act like I'm 20 years old anymore.
[03:42.000 --> 03:47.000]  What do they say? The spirit is willing, but the body gives out.
[03:47.000 --> 03:50.000]  Now I'm going to get past talking about myself here.
[03:50.000 --> 03:55.000]  We're going to go to break and we return on the other side of this quick break.
[03:55.000 --> 03:59.000]  We do have some massive news, obviously exploding everywhere.
[03:59.000 --> 04:04.000]  And if you're informed on the Russiagate situation, yeah, we're all sick of Russiagate.
[04:04.000 --> 04:07.000]  Yeah, it's a bunch of disinfo and everybody gets tired of it.
[04:07.000 --> 04:11.000]  But inside of it, it's a window into the deep state.
[04:11.000 --> 04:16.000]  Like they've meant it to bring down Trump, but hiding in plain view, it should bring them down.
[04:16.000 --> 04:22.000]  Because when you're informed and you listen to McCabe or Comey or any of these other people,
[04:22.000 --> 04:27.000]  they're lying every time they open their fat mouths.
[04:27.000 --> 04:29.000]  And so it's just incredible.
[04:29.000 --> 04:31.000]  We have a 60 minutes clip of that coming up.
[04:31.000 --> 04:32.000]  It's on dredgerport.com.
[04:32.000 --> 04:37.000]  It's also on infowars.com and newswars.com.
[04:37.000 --> 04:43.000]  And so here he is contradicting his testimony to Congress.
[04:43.000 --> 04:45.000]  Should I even go pull the clips up and then play this?
[04:45.000 --> 04:49.000]  I mean, the guy is a fricking liar, man.
[04:49.000 --> 04:52.000]  Either way, you slice it.
[04:52.000 --> 04:55.000]  Even if he's telling the truth now, then he lied to Congress.
[04:55.000 --> 04:56.000]  What a dirtbag.
[04:56.000 --> 04:58.000]  What a piece of filth.
[04:58.000 --> 05:10.000]  It's an FBI agent.
[05:10.000 --> 05:38.000]  We have developed hands down from our research, the most powerful, healthy energy drink pre-workout and beyond system in the world.
[05:38.000 --> 05:40.000]  There's nothing else like it.
[05:40.000 --> 05:41.000]  You must experience it.
[05:41.000 --> 05:43.000]  It is a total game changer.
[05:43.000 --> 05:48.000]  And it comes in easy to use packets to mix it with fruit juice or water, whatever you'd like.
[05:48.000 --> 05:50.000]  Warning though, it's very, very strong.
[05:50.000 --> 05:51.000]  It lasts 10 hours.
[05:51.000 --> 05:57.000]  So take a half packet the first time you take it because TurboForce is named TurboForce because it will take you into overdrive.
[05:57.000 --> 06:17.000]  TurboForce and enforcelive.com
[06:17.000 --> 06:32.000]  Infowars, tomorrow's news today.
[06:32.000 --> 06:37.000]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[06:37.000 --> 06:54.000]  If you want to stop tyranny, well so does he, live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[06:54.000 --> 06:59.000]  It's Thursday, February 14th, 2019.
[06:59.000 --> 07:02.000]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[07:02.000 --> 07:05.000]  We're going to be here for the next four hours.
[07:05.000 --> 07:11.000]  This is Alex Jones' band, demonized broadcast in the world for good reason.
[07:11.000 --> 07:14.000]  We tell the truth and we're fearless.
[07:14.000 --> 07:19.000]  We really appreciate you, the audience, understanding without you spreading the word.
[07:19.000 --> 07:23.000]  This operation will get hammered into oblivion.
[07:23.000 --> 07:24.000]  Now that's what's meant to happen.
[07:24.000 --> 07:25.000]  It'll happen.
[07:25.000 --> 07:29.000]  But I'd like to stay at the battle stations as long as possible in this critical time.
[07:29.000 --> 07:33.000]  And I appreciate you all standing with us.
[07:33.000 --> 07:38.000]  I think a big deal, this issue I'm going to cover next hour,
[07:38.000 --> 07:47.000]  that I'm going to do some preparation on it because I don't want to just put this info out and not have some ceremony.
[07:47.000 --> 07:53.000]  Because so much what we do is, all cattle know hat.
[07:53.000 --> 08:03.000]  You know, I don't have the open top 1975 cattle act with fake steer horns on it.
[08:03.000 --> 08:09.000]  And I'm not wearing a cowboy hat in a white suit, but I do have cattle.
[08:09.000 --> 08:14.000]  And usually the guy driving around with their boss hog doesn't actually have any cattle
[08:14.000 --> 08:16.000]  and doesn't know how to put a saddle on a horse.
[08:16.000 --> 08:20.000]  And that's what we see in this whole phony society.
[08:20.000 --> 08:26.000]  But then when you're all cattle in no hat, you just kind of just deliver the massive goods continually.
[08:26.000 --> 08:28.000]  And the establishment knows what they're hearing.
[08:28.000 --> 08:29.000]  And they're scared.
[08:29.000 --> 08:31.000]  They're like, boy, everybody pays attention to this.
[08:31.000 --> 08:34.000]  We're done.
[08:34.000 --> 08:40.000]  And this particular article right here is so incredible.
[08:40.000 --> 08:45.000]  Post this in hold info wars.com please.
[08:45.000 --> 08:50.000]  And if you just deliver the goods right up front, nobody cares.
[08:50.000 --> 08:52.000]  So I'm not going to tell you what this article is.
[08:52.000 --> 09:03.000]  We're going to post it info wars.com and news wars.com info with a note that I'm going to cover it all at 1215.
[09:03.000 --> 09:10.000]  That should give me time to get the clips together and to properly back this up.
[09:10.000 --> 09:16.000]  I'm going to put a note on there that 1215 I'm covering and then once that part of the show is done, we can cut that video out and put it in there.
[09:16.000 --> 09:21.000]  Because this is a big deal.
[09:21.000 --> 09:27.000]  And it also shows that even mainstream media can find its soul again.
[09:27.000 --> 09:37.000]  But this is the type of stuff that's gotten me sued is asking questions.
[09:37.000 --> 09:43.000]  So many times when things are being staged, then you have to question everything and sometimes things aren't staged.
[09:43.000 --> 09:59.000]  But this is a big giant famous event that a major news agency is admitting they went and found was completely staged, including children being hurt, children being killed, totally staged.
[09:59.000 --> 10:06.000]  But then out of that, you could end up with hundreds of thousands dead and World War three.
[10:06.000 --> 10:09.000]  So that's coming up.
[10:09.000 --> 10:15.000]  Obviously next next segment.
[10:15.000 --> 10:19.000]  We're going to get into McCabe.
[10:19.000 --> 10:27.000]  And that's something that's so big it's it's really hard to even do proper justice.
[10:27.000 --> 10:38.000]  I got up this morning and I watched this interview, parts of it, all the children were running around getting ready for school and eating their breakfast.
[10:38.000 --> 10:50.000]  It gave me a headache because my brain went and accessed its memory banks and remembered a bunch of times he testified to Congress and lied to Congress.
[10:50.000 --> 10:59.000]  And then I'm sitting there on YouTube trying to find it to send it to the producers and, you know, my daughters asked me to come a knot out of her hair.
[10:59.000 --> 11:01.000]  Well, I please put the iPad down.
[11:01.000 --> 11:05.000]  And so I got here and didn't get the clips to the producers.
[11:05.000 --> 11:09.000]  So it's almost like I don't even want to play this if I don't do the justice.
[11:09.000 --> 11:11.000]  You know what I mean?
[11:11.000 --> 11:19.000]  McCabe says he ordered the obstruction probe.
[11:19.000 --> 11:31.000]  Now he told Congress he had nothing to do with the obstruction probe and that the president had never been under investigation.
[11:31.000 --> 11:41.000]  Rosenstein testified that the wire was just a joke and that the president also was never under investigation.
[11:41.000 --> 11:44.000]  But he was directly the target of the investigation.
[11:44.000 --> 12:00.000]  So they both lied to Congress and now he's on 60 Minutes saying it because he doesn't think you have a memory.
[12:00.000 --> 12:02.000]  He thinks you're moron.
[12:02.000 --> 12:05.000]  He thinks he's not going to get in trouble.
[12:05.000 --> 12:08.000]  Now, of course, there is a grand jury convened.
[12:08.000 --> 12:16.000]  Actually, you only know two of them, but you never see that in the news. It's been in the news grand jury convened over McCabe lying to Congress.
[12:16.000 --> 12:20.000]  You can find it in some local papers.
[12:20.000 --> 12:25.000]  But that's it.
[12:25.000 --> 12:32.000]  And he sits up there all over television talking about new lows for the country with Trump.
[12:32.000 --> 12:43.000]  When it's come out that FBI agents went, the documents been released, went to the State Department and basically said,
[12:43.000 --> 12:49.000]  we'll let you reclassify these as not secret or top secret so that Hillary doesn't go to jail.
[12:49.000 --> 13:01.000]  But we want plum overseas jobs in the nicest cities in Europe.
[13:01.000 --> 13:08.000]  I mean, that's the level selling your country out.
[13:08.000 --> 13:14.000]  And you actually go put it in writing a threat to the State Department.
[13:14.000 --> 13:21.000]  If you don't get a plum job, that's what these FBI agents have turned into at the top.
[13:21.000 --> 13:26.000]  What a group of criminals.
[13:26.000 --> 13:30.000]  God help us.
[13:30.000 --> 13:41.000]  Now, since we've gone into this area, Robert Barnes, lawyer, is one of the best public speakers I've ever heard.
[13:41.000 --> 13:49.000]  I told him I wanted him to talk about Mueller more in his criminal history and Isaac Asimov's son and Mueller covering it up and all this.
[13:49.000 --> 14:06.000]  Because you know where McCabe came from. So what I'm going to do is it's a 30-minute mini-documentary titled Mueller Adjourned to the Dark Side that Rob do put together.
[14:06.000 --> 14:11.000]  I think I'm going to have it reuploaded. The audio is a little low on our version, but we're going to boost the audio here.
[14:11.000 --> 14:20.000]  It's a great piece that Rob put together. It's a documentary. We're going to air that for the next couple of segments when we come back.
[14:20.000 --> 14:32.000]  And then in the last segment of the hour, I'll get to McCabe in those clips, but it's incredible how evil Mueller is and the things he's been engaged in and what he's gotten away with.
[14:32.000 --> 14:45.000]  And the way the government, all these agencies, blackmail each other and just how incredibly corrupt it is and how foreign governments just walk in and are just buying everyone off publicly.
[14:45.000 --> 14:52.000]  And you know, I've talked to some really smart people in Washington and they said, Alex, you don't get it, do you?
[14:52.000 --> 14:57.000]  They said they're going after Trump because he didn't take money from the Russians.
[14:57.000 --> 15:05.000]  And they, it's not just that they took money and they're blaming him for what they did by them putting Trump off his balance.
[15:05.000 --> 15:09.000]  He can't even make deals with Russia. He can't even build buildings there or anything.
[15:09.000 --> 15:22.000]  But beyond that, they just want him pushed off of their quarry because Russia is so incredibly wealthy and the globalists are still in control of much of Russia's wealth and they're all up there buying and selling Russian assets.
[15:22.000 --> 15:29.000]  So that was just so Trump dare not even be an executive with Russia so they can still kind of run their Russia projects.
[15:29.000 --> 15:32.000]  And I kind of knew that, but it didn't really sink in.
[15:32.000 --> 15:36.000]  Mueller's on the boards with these Russian companies. They just give him money. They're all corrupt.
[15:36.000 --> 15:41.000]  And then they point their fingers at us and say, we're Russians with no proof.
[15:41.000 --> 15:44.000]  It's just insane and it's criminal.
[15:44.000 --> 15:50.000]  There's so much coming up today, but the Robert Barnes really knocked it out of the park.
[15:50.000 --> 15:59.000]  So when we come back, we're going straight to this documentary and we're going to repost to the front page of info wars.com so you can share it.
[15:59.000 --> 16:03.000]  Pain in my neck, back and shoulders has really gotten worse.

[20:28.000 --> 20:34.000]  So we're going to air large excerpts of this very powerful piece put together, a mini documentary.
[20:34.000 --> 20:37.000]  Muller, a journey to the dark side.
[20:37.000 --> 20:40.000]  Take a peek into the former FBI directors.
[20:40.000 --> 20:45.000]  They say shady past, deeply disturbing.
[20:45.000 --> 20:50.000]  Master Fixer past, I mean just unbelievably bad.
[20:50.000 --> 20:54.000]  You know, it's like the Monty Python joke where the devil appears in a puff of smoke.
[20:54.000 --> 20:58.000]  Every time something bad happens, then this appears in another puff of smoke.
[20:58.000 --> 21:08.000]  It's just like, whoa, just when you think it couldn't get any worse, this guy is completely evil.
[21:08.000 --> 21:17.000]  And continues to cover up child molestation and child molestation rinks and child porn.
[21:17.000 --> 21:19.000]  And people are like, hey, Robert Muller is dangerous, he'll kill you.
[21:19.000 --> 21:21.000]  Well, somebody's going to stand up for these kids, man.
[21:21.000 --> 21:23.000]  I'm not looking for trouble, okay?
[21:23.000 --> 21:26.000]  But everybody else can just sit there and kiss his butt if you want to.
[21:26.000 --> 21:28.000]  I'm not doing it.
[21:28.000 --> 21:31.000]  The country was built on people standing up.
[21:31.000 --> 21:34.000]  Now everybody just kisses butt all day and that's why we're in trouble.
[21:34.000 --> 21:37.000]  I know the audience is awesome and I thank you.
[21:37.000 --> 21:40.000]  By the way, I spent like four minutes talking about this yesterday.
[21:40.000 --> 21:44.000]  I'm going to spend like one minute now and then get to the documentary.
[21:44.000 --> 21:50.000]  If you shop with the good guys, if you vote with your dollars as you've been doing to support them for wars in the face of all these attacks,
[21:50.000 --> 21:52.000]  it changes the world.
[21:52.000 --> 21:55.000]  You have relaunched capitalism and nationalism worldwide.
[21:55.000 --> 21:57.000]  You're just as important as I am.
[21:57.000 --> 21:58.000]  We've done it together.
[21:58.000 --> 22:02.000]  Whether you're Matt Drudge or Alex Jones or someone listening or watching right now that spreads the word,
[22:02.000 --> 22:04.000]  the price of the show that buys products.
[22:04.000 --> 22:08.000]  But if you'll just get your toothpaste from us that's excellent and fluoride free,
[22:08.000 --> 22:10.000]  the best out there concentrate.
[22:10.000 --> 22:12.000]  If you'll just get our great coffee.
[22:12.000 --> 22:13.000]  Everybody loves it.
[22:13.000 --> 22:17.000]  Even, you know, enemy channels, vice and review.
[22:17.000 --> 22:19.000]  And so this is incredibly good coffee.
[22:19.000 --> 22:21.000]  The storeable food they said was great.
[22:21.000 --> 22:22.000]  They couldn't believe it.
[22:22.000 --> 22:30.000]  But the point is, is that, yeah, we go out and get whatever the best is and then discount.
[22:30.000 --> 22:32.000]  But if you'll just get your toothpaste from us,
[22:32.000 --> 22:34.000]  if you'll just get your coffee from us,
[22:34.000 --> 22:38.000]  if you'll just get your protein bars from us,
[22:38.000 --> 22:41.000]  you'll save money, you'll support the info war,
[22:41.000 --> 22:43.000]  you'll change the world and you'll be healthier.
[22:43.000 --> 22:53.000]  We set out and talked to the three top firms in the country that you can get designer food from.
[22:53.000 --> 22:56.000]  Because, you know, most of these big companies don't actually own the factory.
[22:56.000 --> 22:57.000]  So we went to them.
[22:57.000 --> 22:58.000]  It's organic.
[22:58.000 --> 22:59.000]  It's high quality.
[22:59.000 --> 23:02.000]  And we said, what is the best highest in highest rated bars?
[23:02.000 --> 23:03.000]  They said, they're like these.
[23:03.000 --> 23:06.000]  We said, we want to make them better.
[23:06.000 --> 23:07.000]  What's the cost?
[23:07.000 --> 23:14.000]  And we found out that our cost is basically above anybody else's out there.
[23:14.000 --> 23:18.000]  But we've been able to lower the price because we're not putting five, seven times markup in there.
[23:18.000 --> 23:25.000]  So high end energy bars or protein bars are usually six to seven dollars.
[23:25.000 --> 23:29.000]  Ours at regular price are three dollars.
[23:29.000 --> 23:35.000]  Discounted right now out of the gates in the vanilla coconut and peanut butter chocolate,
[23:35.000 --> 23:38.000]  two different types in 12 bar boxes,
[23:38.000 --> 23:44.000]  delivered to your home is two dollars and 40 cents a piece.
[23:44.000 --> 23:47.000]  You absolutely cannot get a better deal.
[23:47.000 --> 23:49.000]  And people around the office are flipping out.
[23:49.000 --> 23:55.000]  They're saying, these are the best protein bars we've ever tasted.
[23:55.000 --> 23:57.000]  They're like, why are they so good?
[23:57.000 --> 24:01.000]  Because everybody cuts corners, folks.
[24:01.000 --> 24:03.000]  We don't do that.
[24:03.000 --> 24:06.000]  The best quality, the lowest price.
[24:06.000 --> 24:08.000]  In ForwardsLife.com takes you right there.
[24:08.000 --> 24:09.000]  They're probably demonized.
[24:09.000 --> 24:11.000]  Now he's selling protein bars.
[24:11.000 --> 24:12.000]  Those are a scam too.
[24:12.000 --> 24:16.000]  Next you'll sell oxygen at the beach to scuba divers.
[24:16.000 --> 24:21.000]  And like you need oxygen.
[24:21.000 --> 24:24.000]  Washington Post, he's a scammer selling snake oil.
[24:24.000 --> 24:27.000]  We're on by Jeff Bezos that makes Moses money on supplements.
[24:27.000 --> 24:32.000]  Supplement sell because they work.
[24:32.000 --> 24:34.000]  Unbelievable.
[24:34.000 --> 24:36.000]  It's incredible.
[24:36.000 --> 24:40.000]  It's just stuff from nature that hasn't gone to the drug company system.
[24:40.000 --> 24:43.000]  And the system wants to get between you and what's in nature.
[24:43.000 --> 24:48.000]  Now they're going to say our super high quality protein bars are real.
[24:48.000 --> 24:49.000]  You judge for yourself.
[24:49.000 --> 24:51.000]  In ForwardsLife.com.
[24:51.000 --> 24:53.000]  Also the big super sale ends.
[24:53.000 --> 24:57.000]  Big super sale ends this weekend for 50% off Brain Force Plus.
[24:57.000 --> 25:01.000]  When you get a combo packed with Turbo Force.
[25:01.000 --> 25:03.000]  The two go together like a horse and carriage.

[25:11.000 --> 25:15.000]  In ForwardsLife.com or AAA-2533139.
[25:15.000 --> 25:17.000]  All right, I kind of went late on that.
[25:17.000 --> 25:21.000]  This is about a 30 minute documentary, but the whole thing is powerful.
[25:21.000 --> 25:23.000]  So I'll back things up.
[25:23.000 --> 25:26.000]  We'll air most of the next two segments.
[25:26.000 --> 25:29.000]  Then I'll come back in the next hour, get into McCabe.
[25:29.000 --> 25:35.000]  And then I'll get into this incredible story that I'm not going to cover yet.
[25:35.000 --> 25:38.000]  That's just absolutely critical.
[25:38.000 --> 25:41.000]  But again, we need your support, that your support,
[25:41.000 --> 25:44.000]  spreading the word, supporting local stations and purchasing products.
[25:44.000 --> 25:46.000]  We cannot stand against the globalists.
[25:46.000 --> 25:47.000]  If you support us, we can do it.
[25:47.000 --> 25:48.000]  All right, thank you.
[25:48.000 --> 25:53.000]  Now let's go ahead and let's go ahead and go to this many documentary that I hope you'll share.
[25:53.000 --> 25:56.000]  Muller, A Journey to the Dark Side.
[25:56.000 --> 25:59.000]  Muller is no patriot.
[25:59.000 --> 26:05.000]  The potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist.
[26:05.000 --> 26:08.000]  Whitey Bulger had a connection with the FBI.
[26:08.000 --> 26:11.000]  He wouldn't think twice about walking into your living room and blowing your brains out.
[26:11.000 --> 26:19.000]  Commerce Secretary Ron Brown and 32 others were on a military plane that crashed today in a violent storm.
[26:19.000 --> 26:22.000]  There are no known survivors at this time.
[26:22.000 --> 26:26.000]  There are no indications of a problem other than the obvious, bad weather.
[26:26.000 --> 26:31.000]  We wanted to go to San Diego and find out what an FBI informant is doing,
[26:31.000 --> 26:37.000]  providing cover and shelter for a Saudi terrorist.
[26:37.000 --> 26:39.000]  And Mueller tried to stop him.
[26:39.000 --> 26:42.000]  He helped many of the key people that were connected to the Saudis
[26:42.000 --> 26:45.000]  and connected to the Bin Laden family to escape the United States.
[26:45.000 --> 26:48.000]  We now have in this country what is a runaway investigation.
[26:48.000 --> 26:50.000]  It's spinning out of control.
[26:50.000 --> 26:55.000]  It's led by Muller and is married man of trumpeting deep state sycophants.
[26:55.000 --> 26:59.000]  We're going to lose our entire culture in our society if we don't start standing up.
[26:59.000 --> 27:01.000]  I mean, there's no end to these crazy people.
[27:01.000 --> 27:03.000]  The truth is collateral damage.
[27:03.000 --> 27:07.000]  We caught him. We caught him. We exposed that this was going on.
[27:07.000 --> 27:12.000]  If you look at Mueller's entire history, you see sort of the deep state fix-it man
[27:12.000 --> 27:15.000]  is the role that Mueller has played for the better part of three decades.
[27:15.000 --> 27:19.000]  Here's a guy who came from sort of the wealthy, affluent, old money families.
[27:19.000 --> 27:22.000]  So old money goes back to when New York was New Amsterdam.
[27:22.000 --> 27:26.000]  That's how far back his sort of old money, deep state ties go.
[27:26.000 --> 27:29.000]  So he goes to Princeton during this sort of Ivy League peak days,
[27:29.000 --> 27:34.000]  part of the dining club culture there that's sort of like the secret societies of Yale and other places.
[27:34.000 --> 27:40.000]  He goes from there. He volunteers to serve as part of sort of the officer corps in Vietnam.
[27:40.000 --> 27:44.000]  It doesn't actually see any real problems or isn't harmed in any way,
[27:44.000 --> 27:48.000]  which is sort of a habit of those sort of more privileged kids who go off to war
[27:48.000 --> 27:52.000]  somehow managed to come back unharmed and more frequently than not.
[27:52.000 --> 27:58.000]  He comes back. He becomes a lawyer. He joins the U.S. Attorney's Office in the northern district of California
[27:58.000 --> 28:03.000]  and manages to work his way up to Boston.
[28:03.000 --> 28:06.000]  He becomes one of the assistant prosecutors in Massachusetts.
[28:06.000 --> 28:11.000]  Well, it's interesting who, when he is at the U.S. Attorney's Office in the district of Massachusetts in Boston,
[28:11.000 --> 28:16.000]  well, guess who they are supervising as a secret witness, as a secret informant,
[28:16.000 --> 28:19.000]  who they are covering for, Whitey Bolcher.
[28:19.000 --> 28:23.000]  That's what puts Robert Mueller on the map in terms of the political space.
[28:23.000 --> 28:29.000]  He becomes one of the key people involved who helps keep four innocent people in a state prison in Massachusetts
[28:29.000 --> 28:35.000]  by covering for the fact that, in fact, Whitey Bolcher was the mob boss, the Boston mob boss,
[28:35.000 --> 28:40.000]  who was responsible for the crime that those four innocent people were serving in prison for.
[28:40.000 --> 28:49.000]  Mueller parlays that successful cover-up of the Whitey Bolcher criminal regime that was involved with the FBI in Boston into a position
[28:49.000 --> 28:52.000]  under the Bush Department of Justice in Washington, D.C.
[28:52.000 --> 28:57.000]  He becomes one of the key people there during key prosecutions.
[28:59.000 --> 29:04.000]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla. I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[29:04.000 --> 29:09.000]  I sued the IRS in one. I beat the IRS then, and I've been beating them ever since.
[29:09.000 --> 29:13.000]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement, and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems
[29:13.000 --> 29:16.000]  they thought might never be solved. I can help you too.

[32:00.000 --> 32:06.000]  Wars are like 12-round heavyweight boxing championship fights.
[32:06.000 --> 32:12.000]  It's about who wants it, who's prepared to go the longest and who's ready to do the damage.
[32:12.000 --> 32:16.000]  We took on Hillary Clinton. We stopped her. We got a national stand.
[32:16.000 --> 32:20.000]  Nationalists are getting elected all over the world right now. We are winning.
[32:20.000 --> 32:26.000]  But those of us who are at the very front line at the tip of the spear are under unprecedented attack.
[32:26.000 --> 32:31.000]  So I come to you each day and try to explain to you that this is a war of attrition.

[33:25.000 --> 33:32.000]  The Alex Jones Show. Because there is a war on, or your mind.
[33:38.000 --> 33:45.000]  Molar Parley is that successful cover-up of the Whitey-Bulger criminal regime that was involved with the FBI in Boston
[33:45.000 --> 33:50.000]  into a position under the Bush Department of Justice in Washington, D.C.
[33:50.000 --> 33:54.000]  It becomes one of the key people there during key prosecutions,
[33:54.000 --> 34:00.000]  such as the prosecution of BCCI and the prosecution of Manuel Noriega.
[34:00.000 --> 34:04.000]  So BCCI was the Money Launderers Bank of Choice.
[34:04.000 --> 34:08.000]  They had a former Kennedy Attorney General who was one of their key bank private counsel.
[34:08.000 --> 34:12.000]  BCCI was where the drug dealers went. BCCI is where terrorists went.
[34:12.000 --> 34:16.000]  BCCI is where marginal political regimes that were under sanctions went.
[34:16.000 --> 34:21.000]  BCCI was basically the Money Laundering Bank of Choice for the world's rogues, the world's terrorists,
[34:21.000 --> 34:24.000]  the world's most violent criminal gangs and operations.
[34:24.000 --> 34:28.000]  What was key was that BCCI could implicate the CIA.
[34:28.000 --> 34:33.000]  BCCI could implicate high-ranking members of the intelligence infrastructure in the United States.
[34:33.000 --> 34:38.000]  BCCI could implicate high-ranking politicians not only here in the United States,
[34:38.000 --> 34:45.000]  but other places in the world that were favorable to the intelligence and deep state infrastructure of America's political power hierarchy.
[34:45.000 --> 34:50.000]  And so that was where Bob Mueller stepped in again, the deep state fix-it ban.
[34:50.000 --> 34:55.000]  He made sure the BCCI case didn't go far afield, and you don't have to take my word for it.
[34:55.000 --> 35:00.000]  Just read what William Sapphire wrote about who was a columnist for the New York Times,
[35:00.000 --> 35:05.000]  wrote about what Robert Mueller was doing as to the BCCI case when he was interfering
[35:05.000 --> 35:09.000]  with the ability of the New York prosecutor to meaningfully look into the case.
[35:09.000 --> 35:17.000]  The New York state prosecutor had been the long-term, long-time head of the New York District Attorney's Office for Manhattan.
[35:17.000 --> 35:22.000]  The guy that they built the show Law and Order was premised upon, his legacy and his history,
[35:22.000 --> 35:27.000]  was trying to meaningfully investigate the various criminal activities of BCCI,
[35:27.000 --> 35:32.000]  who was interfering Robert Mueller, the Department of Justice under the Poppy Bush administration.
[35:32.000 --> 35:36.000]  This was documented in detail repeatedly by William Sapphire on the pages of
[35:36.000 --> 35:40.000]  no less a publication than the New York Times itself.
[35:40.000 --> 35:44.000]  Despite this, the effect of it was that the BCCI case would never contaminate
[35:44.000 --> 35:48.000]  critical political figures in Washington or around the world,
[35:48.000 --> 35:54.000]  particularly those connected to corruption within our own intelligence infrastructure in the United States,
[35:54.000 --> 35:59.000]  and in what's loosely called the Five Eyes in the United Kingdom and Australia and elsewhere.
[35:59.000 --> 36:06.000]  The Bob Mueller would then parlay that success into the manual Noriega prosecution.
[36:06.000 --> 36:13.000]  Noriega, the long-time dictator of Panama, using his powers ahead of the military
[36:13.000 --> 36:19.000]  to effectively control its political process, killing political adversaries, corrupting elections,
[36:19.000 --> 36:25.000]  having people disappear who would say bad things about him, like calling him pineapple face or things like that,
[36:25.000 --> 36:32.000]  in a very high-profile public way, who was the main drug runner's choice of political operative,
[36:32.000 --> 36:37.000]  that there's a reason why the Panama banks were a critical place to launder money
[36:37.000 --> 36:42.000]  for both the drug lords and the gun runners, but it was also Panama was for a long period of time
[36:42.000 --> 36:47.000]  a centralized location for distribution of both drugs and guns throughout Latin Central and North America
[36:47.000 --> 36:49.000]  under Noriega's worthless rule.
[36:49.000 --> 36:56.000]  People suspected that Noriega was behind the assassination and the death of his own prior president of Panama
[36:56.000 --> 36:59.000]  who helped bring the Panama Canal back to Panama.
[36:59.000 --> 37:01.000]  That is who manual Noriega was.
[37:01.000 --> 37:07.000]  The problem was manual Noriega was a U.S. source dating back to the late 1960s and early 1970s,
[37:07.000 --> 37:13.000]  when he had been approached by U.S. intelligence in Panama while he was just in military school.
[37:13.000 --> 37:17.000]  He became a critical source of U.S. intelligence throughout that entire time period.
[37:17.000 --> 37:22.000]  So when he went AWOL, he went off the reservation like Saddam Hussein did in the late 90s,
[37:22.000 --> 37:26.000]  the net effect of it was that the political infrastructure here had to punish him.
[37:26.000 --> 37:30.000]  And so Poppy Bush, who had previously been ahead of the CIA during a time period
[37:30.000 --> 37:35.000]  which manual Noriega was an informant for the CIA while working for the Panama government,
[37:35.000 --> 37:36.000]  needed to crush him.
[37:36.000 --> 37:40.000]  So we had the invasion of Panama on the arrest of Mr. Noriega,
[37:40.000 --> 37:46.000]  and the big question at his trial was going to be whether Noriega could defend himself against the allegations and accusations
[37:46.000 --> 37:53.000]  by pointing out that he was actually on the CIA's payroll while he was doing the things he was accused of doing in a U.S. court.
[37:53.000 --> 37:58.000]  So they needed someone from the U.S. legal system to cover for manual Noriega,
[37:58.000 --> 38:06.000]  to make sure that Mr. Noriega could not report on the crimes that he did at the behest and the behalf of Poppy Bush in the CIA in the deep state.
[38:06.000 --> 38:08.000]  In steps, Robert Mueller.
[38:08.000 --> 38:13.000]  Mr. Mueller would help manage and micromanage and supervise that prosecution
[38:13.000 --> 38:19.000]  and convince the federal judge to not even allow Mr. Noriega to tell the truth in his own defense,
[38:19.000 --> 38:24.000]  to not even allow him to voice what in fact was the reality and the facts and the history,
[38:24.000 --> 38:31.000]  was that he had actually been working on behalf and at the behest of the CIA and other members of the deep state infrastructure
[38:31.000 --> 38:34.000]  when he was running guns, when he was running drugs,
[38:34.000 --> 38:40.000]  when he was involved in various criminal illicit activities that put Americans' well-being at risk.
[38:40.000 --> 38:46.000]  Once when Mueller satisfied that objective, this was the third time he had helped fix the deep state's problems.
[38:46.000 --> 38:51.000]  Whitey Bolger in Boston, then BCCI, then Mr. Noriega.
[38:51.000 --> 39:01.000]  Then Poppy Bush lost his reelection bid and Bill Clinton came in and Mr. Robert Mueller went off to cash in and make millions of dollars in the private sector.
[39:01.000 --> 39:05.000]  He was there for a couple of years when he took a peculiar resume path.
[39:05.000 --> 39:14.000]  He then became an assistant prosecutor, not a head prosecutor, not a chief of any division of a prosecution unit.
[39:14.000 --> 39:17.000]  He had gone from being one of the top people at the Department of Justice,
[39:17.000 --> 39:24.000]  making lots of money in the private sector to becoming a low-level assistant in the homicide division in the District of Columbia.
[39:24.000 --> 39:27.000]  It seemed a peculiar and unusual transition.
[39:27.000 --> 39:36.000]  Now people would note later that, in fact, he could have potentially had the jurisdiction and authority to pursue deaths that happened in the Clinton administration
[39:36.000 --> 39:39.000]  during the time period that he was at the District of Columbia office.
[39:39.000 --> 39:47.000]  He did use his time there to argue for the cover-up of various FBI agents and misconduct that took place in Waco, Texas,
[39:47.000 --> 39:50.000]  as was later documented in detail by Mr. Barr's book.
[39:50.000 --> 39:58.000]  Mr. Mueller used his connections to lobby further to be a cover-up and no further action taken, adverse employment action taken
[39:58.000 --> 40:02.000]  to any of the agents that led to the death of those people at Waco.
[40:02.000 --> 40:08.000]  But he not only did that, whatever he did at this low-level position while he was in the District of Columbia's office,
[40:08.000 --> 40:10.000]  two things did not happen.
[40:10.000 --> 40:13.000]  There was no investigation into the death of Ron Brown.
[40:13.000 --> 40:19.000]  Ron Brown was the Secretary of Commerce under President Clinton when he became under federal criminal grand jury investigation
[40:19.000 --> 40:21.000]  and his own mistress turned rat.
[40:21.000 --> 40:28.000]  And the issues was whether Ron Brown, who was known as sort of the bag man for the Democratic Party for many decades,
[40:28.000 --> 40:33.000]  who got his name to fame originally through Reverend Jesse Jackson and then became a political fixer,
[40:33.000 --> 40:38.000]  such that it led him to be the Commerce Secretary in the President Clinton's cabinet.
[40:38.000 --> 40:41.000]  That took an unusual commerce trip.
[40:41.000 --> 40:48.000]  Usually you don't take a commerce trip to develop tourism or to develop a commercial relationship in a country that is in a war zone.
[40:48.000 --> 40:54.000]  But that's what happened apparently to Commerce Secretary Brown when he was flying over a war zone
[40:54.000 --> 40:57.000]  and his plane went down and the black box was never found.
[40:57.000 --> 41:03.000]  There was the possibility, if the District of Columbia's office had chosen where Robert Mueller was now working,
[41:03.000 --> 41:06.000]  to investigate that as a potential homicide.
[41:06.000 --> 41:07.000]  It was never investigated.
[41:07.000 --> 41:14.000]  Nor was did the District of Columbia office meaningfully exercise any discretion or authority to investigate another death that happened
[41:14.000 --> 41:16.000]  under somewhat suspicious circumstances.
[41:16.000 --> 41:25.000]  In the case of Vince Foster, the White House counsel, who reportedly had all of the secrets of the Clintons in his own mind.
[41:25.000 --> 41:30.000]  After that happened, the next extraordinary thing in Robert Mueller's career took place.
[41:30.000 --> 41:36.000]  Mr. Mueller then got a promotion, a transfer, by the Clinton administration.
[41:36.000 --> 41:41.000]  Here's a Republican, high-ranking Republican, 30-year Republican, only appointed by Republicans,
[41:41.000 --> 41:47.000]  highly well-connected in Republican political circles, gets a Democratic president to nominate him
[41:47.000 --> 41:52.000]  for one of the most prestigious gigs in the entire prosecutorial arena,
[41:52.000 --> 41:57.000]  to be the head prosecutor for the Northern District of California in San Francisco.
[41:57.000 --> 42:04.000]  The second most plumb gig outside of the Southern District of New York for any politically ambitious Democratic lawyer.
[42:04.000 --> 42:09.000]  Why did Robert Mueller go from being a low-level District of Columbia prosecutor
[42:09.000 --> 42:13.000]  suddenly to getting this prime gig under a Democratic president?
[42:13.000 --> 42:15.000]  It's never been explained.
[42:15.000 --> 42:19.000]  Then he goes to the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of California,
[42:19.000 --> 42:22.000]  where another one of his peculiar cases takes place.
[42:22.000 --> 42:28.000]  Towards the end of his term, there was a raid by local state officials in a California state prosecution,
[42:28.000 --> 42:33.000]  county prosecution, of the son of a famous science fiction writer, Mr. Asimov.
[42:33.000 --> 42:41.000]  When they did their raid, they found not only what appeared to be child pornography, but also the ability to make and create child pornography.
[42:41.000 --> 42:49.000]  These stories started leaking out to the local press by the police officers who were shocked and horrified by what they saw.
[42:49.000 --> 43:04.000]  Within about a year, year and a half, two years, suddenly all of a sudden the fed swooped.

[46:57.000 --> 47:24.000]  It's that simple. InfoWarsLife.com.
[47:24.000 --> 47:35.000]  Towards the end of his term, there was a raid by local state officials in a California state prosecution, county prosecution, of the son of a famous science fiction writer, Mr. Asimov.
[47:35.000 --> 47:43.000]  When they did their raid, they found not only what appeared to be child pornography, but also the ability to make and create child pornography.
[47:43.000 --> 47:51.000]  These stories started leaking out to the local press by the police officers who were shocked and horrified by what they saw.
[47:51.000 --> 47:58.000]  Within about a year, year and a half, two years, suddenly all of a sudden the fed swoop in, and Mr. Mueller takes over the case.
[47:58.000 --> 48:02.000]  He will wait about a year or so until the case quietly dies.
[48:02.000 --> 48:08.000]  Mr. Asimov will see no time in a federal prison. He'll have his own equipment and everything returned to him.
[48:08.000 --> 48:18.000]  Within a couple of months of that deal getting done, Mr. Mueller had a new nomination. He was made the FBI director under George W. Bush.
[48:18.000 --> 48:26.000]  It is my honor to nominate Robert S. Mueller of California to become the director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
[48:26.000 --> 48:35.000]  In fact, he was made FBI director very soon before the next big deep state scandal would occur, 9-11.
[48:35.000 --> 48:47.000]  So there had been suspicion and some theories for some time that Mr. Mueller used Mr. Asimov's to gain access to names of identities of individuals who are high profile and politically connected,
[48:47.000 --> 48:52.000]  who had been involved in either the production or purchase of child pornography.
[48:52.000 --> 48:56.000]  Whether it's true or not is still unknown because it was never fully investigated or vetted.
[48:56.000 --> 49:03.000]  The congressional committees that oversaw Mr. Mueller's appointment to the FBI chose not to ask a single question about it.
[49:03.000 --> 49:11.000]  Once Mr. Mueller got to the FBI, within weeks 9-11 occurs, what is Mr. Mueller's first action and reaction?
[49:11.000 --> 49:21.000]  As is well documented in stories like The Looming Tower and others, the ground agent of the FBI was giving notice to their hierarchy that there were serious problems afoot,
[49:21.000 --> 49:28.000]  including, in fact, key ranking members of the FBI's anti-terrorism division were reporting serious concerns.
[49:28.000 --> 49:33.000]  The FBI ignored those concerns on the seventh floor, their political hierarchy.
[49:33.000 --> 49:42.000]  So there were FBI agents warning about people learning to only take off on planes and not land, people who were using FBI informants in San Diego and Southern California,
[49:42.000 --> 49:51.000]  who would end up being one of the 21 pilots or people involved in the terror events of 9-11, they or at least alleged or accused to be.
[49:51.000 --> 50:00.000]  And in addition to that, there was concerns about all of Ben Laden's connections, family and political and financial connections of people that were here in the United States at the time of 9-11.
[50:00.000 --> 50:02.000]  What did Robert Mueller do?
[50:02.000 --> 50:12.000]  Well, first, he helped many of the key people that were connected to the Saudis and connected to the Ben Laden family to escape the United States without any meaningful investigation into them,
[50:12.000 --> 50:18.000]  with secret flights out during a time period in which no flights were actually supposed to be allowed at all,
[50:18.000 --> 50:27.000]  least of all for potential suspects or persons of interest, with knowledge and information that could be relevant and significant to the investigation into what actually happened at 9-11.
[50:27.000 --> 50:29.000]  But it went beyond that.
[50:29.000 --> 50:38.000]  Mr. Mueller did a massive cover-up campaign to make sure that nobody would find out for almost a decade that the FBI's ground-level agents, their field agents,
[50:38.000 --> 50:43.000]  had been documenting and detailing concerns that the seventh floor had stayed quiet and moot about.
[50:43.000 --> 50:51.000]  Indeed, one of the key FBI agents who was documenting problems was the head of security at the World Trade Center and died that day.
[50:51.000 --> 50:53.000]  So much of his information went with him.
[50:53.000 --> 51:03.000]  And Robert Mueller would spend the next better part of a half a decade covering up what he knew and other people knew that the FBI didn't act upon for political reasons or unexplained reasons.
[51:03.000 --> 51:20.000]  Mueller has confronted this mounting evidence, and he's candidly admitted what we all now realize, that today we can't say for sure whether the 9-11 attacks might have been stopped if all the dots had been connected and all the leads been followed.
[51:20.000 --> 51:23.000]  And I commend the director for the candor of his recent statements.
[51:23.000 --> 51:36.000]  That would not be the end of Robert Mueller's role as a deep-state fixed man. He would not only be an FBI director under George W. Bush, Barack Obama would continue the bipartisan role of Robert Mueller as a deep-state fixed man
[51:36.000 --> 51:41.000]  and allow him to continue on as FBI director even after he took over.
[51:41.000 --> 51:53.000]  During this time period, Robert Mueller would take critical steps to cover up anything that could implicate high-ranking members of the FBI or law enforcement or intelligence branches or what is loosely or colloquially known as the deep state.
[51:53.000 --> 52:00.000]  President Trump hasn't even been in office a full year yet, but that hasn't stopped the deep state from waging an all-out war against him.
[52:00.000 --> 52:09.000]  The Democrats are working together with the deep state to discredit the duly elected president of the United States while ignoring their own crimes and misconduct.
[52:09.000 --> 52:12.000]  It's a form of a coup. It's very dangerous for our country.
[52:12.000 --> 52:17.000]  I regard the Mueller example as the deep state and it's very worse than it worries me a great deal.
[52:17.000 --> 52:20.000]  This has reached crisis proportions without a doubt.
[52:20.000 --> 52:24.000]  Members of the deep state, these are rogue elements in the permanent bureaucracy.
[52:24.000 --> 52:30.000]  The deep state now working overtime, working to subvert President Trump and his entire administration.
[52:30.000 --> 52:42.000]  This is how the deep state operates. They did it to me personally as a member of Congress when I was the chairman of the oversight committee. I had the Secret Service, more than 40 agents dove into my background because they wanted to embarrass me.
[52:42.000 --> 52:54.000]  This has become a super authority that now has more power than the president of the United States, not envisioned by the Constitution in any way, shape, or form. Why the hell should we put up with it?
[52:54.000 --> 53:01.000]  Someone come to me a year ago and said this is what we would be dealing with now. I really would have thought of it as a conspiracy theory.
[53:01.000 --> 53:13.000]  But what we have seen take place over the last 18 months in the federal bureaucracy has been nothing short of a wholesale repudiation of the election and an effort by entrenched bureaucrats to overturn it.
[53:13.000 --> 53:19.000]  The people in the deep state, they do not like transparency. They don't want accountability. They don't want to be called on the mat.
[53:19.000 --> 53:26.000]  And when a disruptive personality like Donald Trump and his team come along, they want to flee. They don't like the sunshine. They don't like that.
[53:26.000 --> 53:37.000]  Are there forces in the United States that are more powerful than Congress, more powerful than the president of the United States, more powerful than the president and the Congress combined?
[53:37.000 --> 53:52.000]  To get in the leadership, you don't earn your stripes. That was one thing that I had made a decision even before I went to Washington and while I was there, if I had set my goal as to become chairman of the banking committee,
[53:52.000 --> 54:00.000]  I would have had to sell my soul, really. And I said, hey, you do exactly what they tell you. You raise a lot of money and it costs a couple million now.
[54:00.000 --> 54:08.000]  It's probably five or ten million dollars to deliver to the party and you have to do that by kowtowing to the powerful special interest, mainly the military industrial complex.
[54:08.000 --> 54:23.000]  The term the deep state would in fact originate from an 1860s, 1870s economist writer who simply called it the dual state, trying to explain the phenomenon to where democratic forces had less and less control over the day to day operations of government.
[54:23.000 --> 54:37.000]  At that point, it was sort of loosely or colloquially called the administrative state, but in its law enforcement and intelligence branches where people were obtaining power and unable to be removed or their policies changed, no matter what happened in the elections,
[54:37.000 --> 54:47.000]  led to the phrase deep state. It would be popularized and colloquialized again by a group of scholars from Germany in the early 1930s who were trying to explain the rise of fascism.
[54:47.000 --> 55:01.000]  They began to understand what fascism was about and where it came from based on this dual state notion that increasingly there are people who controlled military law enforcement and intelligence branches of government that were immune from democratic forces,
[55:01.000 --> 55:17.000]  that were removed from the democratic process, that they stayed like J. Edgar Hoover, no matter what happened politically, no matter who controlled the House, who controlled the Senate, who controlled the parliament, who controlled the presidency of any government or the prime minister of any government,
[55:17.000 --> 55:33.000]  then in each case and in every case, the political powers that be that control the equivalents of the CIA, whether here or overseas, the high ranking defense department individuals, the high ranking law enforcement people, people that should have been political appointees and subject to the political process
[55:33.000 --> 55:43.000]  were increasingly their own government. Hence the dual state notion, another state outside of, independent of, separate from the democratically controlled political process.
[55:43.000 --> 55:57.000]  And that became known as the deep state in the late 60s and early 70s, originally an idea initiated and brought about by the political left to try to explain the way Hoover was able to operate independent of political process,
[55:57.000 --> 56:14.000]  the way the CIA was able to do coups or MKA ultra, independent of and separate from the political process, whether that political process is the press and public knowledge, or the political process is the legislative bodies that were supposed to be controlling their funding and overseeing them, or the executive branch and the elected head of the executive branch themselves.
[56:14.000 --> 56:28.000]  There's a reason why a general like Eisenhower voiced his concerns in 1959. He was witnessing the dual state, the deep state in action that was so powerful that even a general, former general and a president of the United States felt he could no longer control them.
[56:28.000 --> 56:40.000]  That he needed the public to be aware of their activities so there could be more electoral and democratic little be democratic control of the dual state deep state operation that was entrenching and institutionalizing its political power.
[56:40.000 --> 56:56.000]  Using its control over the intelligence infrastructure, the military infrastructure and the law enforcement infrastructure and the blackmail and extortion files that they were able to acquire an acquisition through that in order to achieve and obtain their power and to keep and protect and preserve that power at all costs.
[56:56.000 --> 57:13.000]  Mr. Mueller understood the deep state had been its key advocate, had been its key protector, had been its key enabler throughout his entire political career. The family heritage that he inherited of protecting privilege and power was extended to the dual state and the deep state during his tenure, both as a prosecutor and as FBI director.
[57:13.000 --> 57:38.000]  So when he is FBI director, not only is he involved in issues related to 9-11 cover up of FBI whistleblower activity that was suppressed by the seventh floor hierarchy, but in addition to that, he will later protect the second level of bank money laundering allegations for rogue states, for drug dealers, for terrorists, for people running arms, for people running drugs, and that would be the HSBC case.
[57:38.000 --> 57:46.000]  So HSBC would come under scrutiny because it was the Bank of Choice for Mexican drug cartels and the Bank of Choice for various terror running operations.
[58:08.000 --> 58:18.000]  They are riddled with dyes and toxins and synthetic caffeine and other chemicals that sure get you a quick boost but burn out in just a few hours and have terrible side effects.

[59:40.000 --> 01:00:01.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:24.000]  Once again, Robert Mueller would step in. The net effect of his intervention would be to limit HSB's prosecution to just some criminal fines,
[01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:34.000]  to protect high-ranking executives from any degree of exposure, and make sure that its role as a deep state facilitator and enabler of corrupt activities around the world would be covered up and hidden.
[01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:46.000]  Nobody within the hierarchy of the intelligence infrastructure, the law enforcement infrastructure, the defense infrastructure of either here or around the world would be implicated by the HSBC scandal thanks to the role of Robert Mueller.
[01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:58.000]  Mr. Mueller wouldn't stop there. Mr. Mueller would help cover up the IRS Tea Party inquiry. That began when the IRS began to target people simply because of their association with known 501C3s or 501C4s,
[01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:07.000]  which are public charities and foundations that engage in public activity. They targeted those associated with the words Tea Party or the words Tax Protester.
[01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:18.000]  They targeted these individuals for harassment, for audit, for selective prosecution, for investigation, for politically motivated censorship and shame campaigns with imprisonment as a potential option,
[01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:23.000]  or possibly bankrupting individuals purely based on their political affiliations and associations.
[01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:33.000]  Who came to the rescue of the IRS's corrupt activity despite multiple IRS commissioners taking the Fifth and refusing to produce their own documents and deleting and destroying emails and other relevant records?
[01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:45.000]  Robert Mueller. Once again, he would cover for the IRS's role as a tool of the dual state and the deep state to harass those they consider their ideological or political adversaries, who can be either on the left or the right.
[01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:59.000]  Mr. Mueller wouldn't stop there. When the FBI and the DEA and others became involved in a very questionable activity of trying to control guns and trying to control guns by actually spreading those guns to Mexican drug cartels known as the fast and furious scandal
[01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:11.000]  when those guns ended up being used against U.S. law enforcement personnel. Who was the person to cover for two different attorney generals who either refused or were in contempt of Congress based on their failure to testify in their omission of relevant records?
[01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:23.000]  Robert Mueller. Well, he was director of the FBI. Fast and furious, covered up. IRS Tea Party, covered up. HSBC, covered up. BCCI, covered up. Noriega, covered up. Whitey Bolger, covered up.
[01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:35.000]  The Asimov case, covered up. But we're not done. Another critical person involved with high-ranking political individuals who appeared to be involved in basically prostituting and pimping out underage minor girls
[01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:49.000]  to high-profile political celebrities and other people, including allegedly royal family members around the world, Mr. Jeffrey Epstein, was under prosecution and investigation when he was exposed for his nefarious conduct in Miami and New York
[01:02:49.000 --> 01:03:00.000]  during the time period that Robert Mueller was the director of the FBI. Mr. Epstein would get a very strange, sweetheart deal that would be covered up for the better part of half a decade, thanks to the activities of Mr. Mueller.
[01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:07.000]  And later, rumors would spread and stories would document that, in fact, it appeared Mr. Epstein acted as an informant for Mr. Mueller.
[01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:20.000]  Basically providing him sort of a blacklist that he could blackmail or that he could extort or that he could have special information in to protect the political prerogatives and prejudices of the dual-state, deep-state that he had long been a loyal servant of.
[01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:39.000]  But 12 years is a long time to do anything, and I guarantee you that Bob's wife Anne agrees. Today, as Bob prepares to complete his service, this is a wonderful opportunity for all of us as a nation to say thank you to Bob and Anne,
[01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:46.000]  but also gives me a chance to announce my choice to be the next director of the FBI, Jim Comey.
[01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:59.000]  So that's the legacy and the history of Robert Mueller. So when he was appointed as a special counsel by Mr. Rod Rosenstein, with whom Mr. Mueller helped introduce the political power more than two decades before,
[01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:09.000]  everybody that knew anything about the deep-state dual-state history or knew anything about Mr. Mueller's history knew what was going to be coming down the pike, knew what was going to happen, knew what was going to transpire.
[01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:21.000]  They could preview it, predict it, forecast it in advance. And what they could advance is they could say that this will be used to cover up all of the illicit spy-gate activities that took place when the Obama administration's hierarchy
[01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:34.000]  weaponized the use of the FBI, weaponized the use of the National Security Agency, weaponized the use of the CIA, weaponized our Five Eyes ties to be able to spy on the Trump administration,
[01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:42.000]  to be able to spy on members of the Trump campaign, to spy on anyone with distant political viewpoints within six degrees of separation of the Trump campaign.
[01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:46.000]  It's important to understand what a Title I FISA warning says.
[01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:55.000]  All right. There's still ten minutes of this left, and it's very powerful. It's on infowars.com.muller, a journey to the dark side with Robert Barnes,

[01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:29.000]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center.
[01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:33.000]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:38.000]  If you just joined us, it's February 14th, Valentine's Day.
[01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:50.000]  2019, Cupid gave me a little present this morning. He didn't shoot me with a love arrow. Poor, my left bicep ruptured it almost entirely. I just had a doctor come diagnose it here.
[01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:54.000]  I didn't want any doctor to tell me that, but that should be fun.
[01:06:54.000 --> 01:07:04.000]  I'm not complaining. It's just that if you see me wince, it has uncontrollable pain spasms off and on every 30 seconds.
[01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:12.000]  But that's the thing about pain. You can dial it out.
[01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:18.000]  But I'm not like Glenn Danzig. I do mind the pain.
[01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:23.000]  Okay.
[01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:29.000]  While I was airing that mini documentary that I was already planning to air today in those very segments,
[01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:37.000]  I thought perfectly that the doctor could get here to look at what happened this morning when I was lifting weights.
[01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:41.000]  So I wasn't just airing that because I had to get looked at. It just worked out that way.
[01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:46.000]  It's really an important documentary as you just heard.
[01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:50.000]  Mueller, A Journey to the Dark Side. It's on infowars.com. It's totally free.
[01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:53.000]  We're paying for the bandwidth, everything. And you know, that's something I'm trying to explain to everybody.
[01:07:53.000 --> 01:08:04.000]  I'm not complaining for you to this big news on McCabe and Moore in his book and his false testimony and his treason.
[01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:13.000]  That it's a paradox how they took all our sponsors by harassing them, including death-threading people.
[01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:20.000]  And how they are now death-threading my lawyers that if they don't drop my case, they're going to kill their children.
[01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:24.000]  And they're giving them specifics and breaking into their offices. People haven't wanted me to go into that,
[01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:28.000]  but I think it's important to the point where we're going to get into it.
[01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:36.000]  And you know, that's the kind of stuff I can ignore. But other people, it's just a whole other ball of wax.
[01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:38.000]  This country is in a civil war.
[01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:46.000]  But when you get taken off YouTube and all these places where we're hosting our videos with billions of views,
[01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:54.000]  we have to pay for the bandwidth. And we pay millions and millions of dollars a year just for the bandwidth.
[01:08:54.000 --> 01:09:12.000]  Then you've got to have the servers. Then you've got to, in fact, IT and server cost and bandwidth cost is bigger than what we had to pay the employees.
[01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:22.000]  So it's a paradox where, wow, Imple Wars traffic quadrupled after we got banned eight months ago.
[01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:31.000]  But that's because we were taken off all of their platforms where the majority of the war was going on.
[01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:35.000]  And so that is where the deplatforming has really hurt us.
[01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:41.000]  You know, the New York Times had headlines like Alex Jones claimed deplatforming would help him. It didn't.
[01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:45.000]  And they twist everything I say. And they take everything I say that's true and turn it into a lie.
[01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:52.000]  They're lie factories. They're deception factories. That's not what I said.
[01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:59.000]  I said, our core audience of people that really care and are informed is bigger than ever.
[01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:08.000]  But our outreach to new people has been decimated, has been crippled.
[01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:14.000]  But that's the thing. The establishment knows I get up here and I talk about things that are really going on and really happening.
[01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:26.000]  They know those numbers. When I sent the New York Times, when they asked me about it, the analytics to show that we were getting four times the traffic, they just didn't include it.
[01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:39.000]  I've had law firms send the New York Times letters with the video clips of where I said I believe Sandy Hook happened four years ago, three years ago, two years ago, where I apologize.
[01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:43.000]  And they will not put it in the New York Times or Washington Post and they say Jones is still doing it, sending people to their homes to hurt them.
[01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:46.000]  It's a clear and present danger. Get him off the air.
[01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:57.000]  Meanwhile, they're really on Twitter saying go to the Covington Kids School, burn it down, shoot them, murder them, punch them in the nose, I'll give you a blow job.
[01:10:57.000 --> 01:11:06.000]  All left on Twitter, all defended, all wonderful. They're doing what they claim I never did.
[01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:16.000]  And they're in the news every day with the families going please stop coming to our houses, please stop harassing us.
[01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:24.000]  You get it in my name, they're saying things I never said, twisting it and then saying I'm the wolf at the door. It's unbelievable.
[01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:30.000]  And I'm not complaining. I'm just saying the level of this deception is incredible.
[01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:36.000]  And the way they've got the corporate media working now is they did a bunch of layoffs years ago and they got them really scared.
[01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:39.000]  And they said now you're going to destroy speech or you're out of a job.
[01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:52.000]  They tell tenure professors your job now is to destroy free speech and to teach journals how to destroy free speech and to be political officers, commissars or you're out of a job.
[01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:58.000]  They're organized tyranny. It's here.
[01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:05.000]  They just say in the manifold case, we're listening to his phone calls to his lawyer and he lied and they give transcripts of his phone calls.
[01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:09.000]  You're not supposed to listen to somebody's calls with their with their lawyer.
[01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:12.000]  That's there's an amendment in the Constitution. You can't do it.
[01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:19.000]  And of course, the FBI has been doing that forever, but they put it in the newspaper now.
[01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:28.000]  They're not just trashing the First Amendment. They're trashing the fourth, the fifth, the seventh, everything.
[01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:33.000]  We're being usurped by multinational corporations. We're being conquered.
[01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:43.000]  And I guess the Scott in Trump, or maybe it's the German, I think that's the stubbornness, but the Scott in Trump doesn't like getting screwed over financially.
[01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:56.000]  He's like, we're a great country, incredible wealth with the biggest military. Why are we selling out? We should dominate everything through a position of strength and commerce, not through force, which is the actual real model.
[01:12:56.000 --> 01:13:01.000]  Globalists don't want us in charge and freedom in charge. They want tyranny in charge.
[01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:13.000]  They want us out of the way, an authoritarian, autocratic, plutocratic, hyper-technocracy, soulless, chai-com operating system.
[01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:15.000]  So we'll get to McCabe and these clips when we come back.
[01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:24.000]  But I was just trying to think about all the lies of McCabe and all the criminal crap he's been involved in and how they have grand juries.
[01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:31.000]  He sent me the articles, now seated, looking to indict him.
[01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:45.000]  And he gets up there on television and he says Trump is immoral and a liar and a crook when he's under criminal investigation for lying to Congress and did it with his butt hanging out from everybody.
[01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:47.000]  And all because he looks like a good, nice man.
[01:13:47.000 --> 01:14:00.000]  Well, Ted Bundy, that liked to kidnap little teenage girls and torture them to death, looked like a guy you'd, you know, buy a used car from.
[01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:05.000]  He looked like a football coach or a tennis coach and he liked to bite big chunks out of women.
[01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:15.000]  So just because somebody looks like there's some Ivy League person, don't think for a minute you're not dealing with a psychotic killer.
[01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:21.000]  All right, we're going to go to break.
[01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:24.000]  My point about the support is I'm not even complaining.
[01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:28.000]  I just want to keep fighting and it's a literal frontline fight.
[01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:30.000]  Everybody's like, oh, we need support under attack.
[01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:31.000]  We're the tip of the spear.
[01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:35.000]  The enemy knows it and they want to demoralize us and shut us down.
[01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:38.000]  And that's why it's so easy to go.
[01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:46.000]  I want the best fluoride-free, colloidal silver iodine fortified toothpaste that doesn't have all the filler in it.
[01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:49.000]  And I'm going to sign up for autoship each month and get an additional 10% off.
[01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:51.000]  And I'll try the coffee.
[01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:52.000]  You'll say, this is incredible.
[01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:54.000]  Sign up for autoship.
[01:14:54.000 --> 01:15:03.000]  They sell the same stuff out of Chiapas on the Guatemalan border for $10 more in the same bags, just different printing at Whole Foods.
[01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:08.000]  98% reviews, 4.9 stars, third parties.
[01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:11.000]  Just sign up for autoship and get your coffee from us.
[01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:17.000]  And now we have, in two different flavors, let's see if we can say flavors.
[01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:18.000]  It's organic.
[01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:22.000]  It's flavored by the coconut and vanilla and then the chocolate and the peanut butter that's in them.
[01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:27.000]  12 bars, an average cost of $3 a bar and comparable bars are $5, $6 or $7.
[01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:29.000]  It's a high-end bar.
[01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:30.000]  Okay?
[01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:32.000]  Normally $3 a piece.
[01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:35.000]  Now, $2.40 a piece in the 12 pack.
[01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:40.000]  InfoWars protein bar is super high-end.
[01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:42.000]  Available at infowarslife.com.
[01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:47.000]  If you just get your protein bars and no replacement from us, you get a great quality product.
[01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:49.000]  You find the InfoWar.
[01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:50.000]  You stick it in the eye of Soros.
[01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:51.000]  You sign up for the unborn.
[01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:53.000]  You sign up for nationalism and so much more.
[01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:55.000]  But we need your support.
[01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:57.000]  We got products you need.
[01:15:57.000 --> 01:16:03.000]  The United States of Empire is a book that claims the United States is the empire of the world.
[01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:06.000]  George Washington had warned us against foreign wars.
[01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:12.000]  The United States of Empire shows that World Wars I and II left England broken.
[01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:16.000]  Its former colony, the U.S., had to save the empire.
[01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:17.000]  Was there ever a vote?
[01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:18.000]  Who do we fight for?
[01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:21.000]  The deep state began with World War I.
[01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:24.000]  The United States of Empire by James Dunn.
[01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:27.000]  Available at Amazon Books.

[01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:27.000]  We are riddled with dyes and toxins and synthetic caffeine and other chemicals that sure get you a quick boost but burn out in just a few hours and have terrible side effects.
[01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:36.000]  We have developed, hands down, from our research, the most powerful, healthy energy drink, pre-workout, and beyond system in the world.
[01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:39.000]  There's nothing else like it, you must experience it.

[01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:48.000]  So it's very, very strong, it lasts 10 hours.
[01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:55.000]  So take a half pack at the first time you take it because Turbo Force is named Turbo Force because it will take you into overdrive.
[01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:58.000]  Turbo Force and enforcelife.com.
[01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:11.000]  I've been doing a lot of research into Google and YouTube censorship and I've noticed that there's one type of video that is the most censored, the most varied, the most suppressed.
[01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:23.000]  And that's the videos where you saw in 2016 election night all the arrogant, leftist authoritarians like the young turds and others get so butt hurt when Trump won.
[01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:29.000]  They don't want us to have that victory, they don't want us to remember what political action did.
[01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:34.000]  And that's why the globalist, Hillary and others, are trying to shut in for us now.
[01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:41.000]  This is a fight about taking your speech away, not just my speech, about taking your very sovereignty away.
[01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:43.000]  This country is in a war.
[01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:48.000]  So again, I want to thank you for what you've done, but I want to remind you, if you don't spread the articles and videos,
[01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:54.000]  and if you don't financially get the great products we have and fund us and the 360 win, we're dead in the water.
[01:19:54.000 --> 01:20:05.000]  I'm in your hands, you're in my hands, infowarstore.com. Thank you.
[01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:26.000]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:20:54.000 --> 01:21:09.000]  Waging war on corruption, crashing through the lines, and disinformation. We're here, my friends.
[01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:20.000]  It's hard once you start playing the fashion mode song to turn it off, especially this part coming up towards the end, powerful.
[01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:24.000]  You know what, we'll just go out with that little piece at the end.
[01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:29.000]  Okay, let me jump right into it here.
[01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:41.000]  Next segment, we're going to cover a story that's really huge and that's getting almost no attention that illustrates everything we're talking about here.
[01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:54.000]  So that's evil technique is it builds and builds and builds under the surface, and when it launches its offensive or its emergence,
[01:21:54.000 --> 01:22:02.000]  it hits you with everything it's got, so that you can't process the last thing that happened before the next 10 things hit you.
[01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:19.000]  It's like, it's a million years ago now, isn't it? Two weeks ago, the governor of Virginia said we don't just kill the babies right when they're born,
[01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:33.000]  we keep them little bugs alive and get their little goodie guts ourselves and make a little money for ourselves, little goodie little list.
[01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:40.000]  And now that's ancient history.
[01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:44.000]  They have a psychological algorithm. They know what they're doing, they're arrogant, they're breaking our will.
[01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:53.000]  Oh, remember a month ago, seems like a trillion years ago, the Covington young people are there, took us 10 minutes on that Saturday.
[01:22:53.000 --> 01:23:00.000]  Rob do, I looked it up, I'm proud of him, was the first person he was up here working on Saturday.
[01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:03.000]  He's off skiing with his sons right now, I told him take off.
[01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:08.000]  He left for four days, he was skiing, he's a great skier and snowboarder.
[01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:14.000]  Let me see his little kids, he like back flips and stuff, it's like, wow, anyways.
[01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:17.000]  He was up here on Saturday, I was up here on Saturday.
[01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:25.000]  I left at like five o'clock and then he saw the footage about seven, he said, hey, I'm tweeting about this.
[01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:31.000]  I went and found the raw video, they go start to fight with them, these crazy black Israelites are saying all this racist crap.
[01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:34.000]  I said, great job, this is going to be big, I'll cover it tomorrow.
[01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:43.000]  The next day it was, but it took four days to get mainstream media to spin it and call it jump to conclusion.
[01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:46.000]  It was just a native being nice and the kids were nice.
[01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:53.000]  No, there's a bunch of racist leftist sorrows scum coming over and these kids were so pure and so nice,
[01:23:53.000 --> 01:24:00.000]  they just thought it was a football dance or a rugby dance and got into it.
[01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:07.000]  And the left then projected all their crap and all their lies and all their BS onto them.
[01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:15.000]  And then you just go back and you go back and you get, it's like Senator Menendez, he played the club yesterday, he goes,
[01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:18.000]  Trump is outrageously evil and racist.
[01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:23.000]  He says that migrants that are involved in drunk driving are criminals.
[01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:28.000]  So you're here illegal and you're a drunk driver, but that's not criminal.
[01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:32.000]  When both of those are criminal, again, it's an inversion of reality.
[01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:38.000]  And that's my biggest beef and I've had Travis County deputy prosecutors in the studio off air, they want to come on air,
[01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:42.000]  showing me cases and documents and I'm like, hey, I already know.
[01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:51.000]  Years ago, where illegal aliens will drunk drive and wreck and the judge lets them out on $10 fines because, oh, you're a poor illegal alien.
[01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:53.000]  Yeah, they got a job and they got welfare.
[01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:55.000]  They're driving a brand new Chevy Silverado.
[01:24:55.000 --> 01:25:03.000]  They plow into somebody, they don't even have insurance and the judge just lets them go because, oh, you're a Mexican, you're God.
[01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:08.000]  Well, in a Mexican American, an American, they don't get that.
[01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:11.000]  I've got Hispanic friends that have got pullover DWIs who are veterans.
[01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:14.000]  They spent $20,000 trying to get it reduced.
[01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:18.000]  I've got Hispanic friends that are white friends that have been caught with a little bit of marijuana.
[01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:19.000]  Throw the book at you.
[01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:28.000]  Illegal alien, see, again, no matter if you're Hispanic or you're a Mexican or if you're white, if you're a citizen, you're a piece of crap.
[01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:30.000]  And the book's thrown at you.
[01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:40.000]  But if you're a precious little illegal alien, why, you're God's gift to this green earth.
[01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:47.000]  And you watch these clips of them signing an abortion bill in New York to kill babies after they're born.
[01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:49.000]  This is not a slow news day.
[01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:50.000]  I've got hundreds of articles.
[01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:51.000]  They're incredible here.
[01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:55.000]  But I want to remind you that they're celebrating laughing.
[01:25:55.000 --> 01:26:02.000]  Yeah, we don't kill babies after they're born.
[01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:12.000]  You know, when Governor Cuomo says America was never great, it'll never be great.
[01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:14.000]  He's demoralizing you.
[01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:16.000]  He's telling you you're a piece of crap.
[01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:23.000]  And he's saying his ancestors are pieces of crap for wanting to come here.
[01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:25.000]  This is a nation where his family came from Italy.
[01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:26.000]  It was a caste system.
[01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:30.000]  And now he can do it every once and he says it's not great.
[01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:32.000]  He says it sucks.
[01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:36.000]  What the hell kind of person is that?
[01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:37.000]  And you put up with that.
[01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:46.000]  It'd be one thing if we were Venezuela, which, by the way, used to be great, but became socialist, or North Korea.
[01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:48.000]  But we are.
[01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:50.000]  We were.
[01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:51.000]  Let's be honest.
[01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:53.000]  We were the greatest nation on earth.
[01:26:53.000 --> 01:27:06.000]  But because of crap like that from Cuomo, we're not because we have cancer and people feeding existential envy.
[01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:14.000]  I mean, these people are dangerous scum.
[01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:21.000]  They signed a bill where now a woman was stabbed to death this weekend.
[01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:23.000]  I went and read the police report.
[01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:27.000]  It was in the New York Post.
[01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:29.000]  Stabbed over 30 times.
[01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:36.000]  Imagine the hate 20 times in the abdomen, slitter throat stabbed her in the face, neck.
[01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:48.000]  He's charged with murdering her, but not with his own baby that was going to be born in a month.
[01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:55.000]  And the police said, well, we tried to charge him for killing the baby, but the prosecutor said it's legal now.
[01:27:55.000 --> 01:27:56.000]  She wanted that baby.
[01:27:56.000 --> 01:27:57.000]  It is a baby.
[01:27:57.000 --> 01:27:59.000]  Human and it's defenseless.
[01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:04.000]  And they sat there and plunged that knife in over and over again.
[01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:10.000]  And that person murdering his own child.
[01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:14.000]  Doesn't get charged with it.
[01:28:14.000 --> 01:28:19.000]  Remember Cuomo said two years ago, he said, if you're pro gone or pro life, get out of New York.
[01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:20.000]  You're not welcome here.
[01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:22.000]  And his own party said, clarify, you don't mean that.
[01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:25.000]  He said, no, I say it again.
[01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:27.000]  He talks like he's on TV IQ.
[01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:30.000]  He goes, oh, you said what you want.
[01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:32.000]  You know, his brother's younger brother's actually pretty well spoken.
[01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:36.000]  He's a snake, but the older brother, like, got the umbilical cord tied around his neck or something.
[01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:37.000]  He's kind of, he didn't get oxygen.
[01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:40.000]  He's pushing maybe a 75 on a good day.
[01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:42.000]  He's like, I did dance.
[01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:44.000]  I said, get out of the state.
[01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:49.000]  We don't let you die.
[01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:55.000]  And it's just like we're ruled by this sack of garbage who celebrates publicly pissing all over the dead bodies of babies.
[01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:56.000]  That's what he does.
[01:28:56.000 --> 01:28:57.000]  He unzips his pants.
[01:28:57.000 --> 01:28:58.000]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[01:28:58.000 --> 01:29:02.000]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:04.000]  I sued the IRS in one.
[01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:07.000]  I beat the IRS then and I've been beating them ever since.
[01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:12.000]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:13.000]  I can help you too.
[01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:15.000]  If you owe taxes, you can't pay.
[01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:16.000]  Don't wait another day.

[01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:24.000]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic.
[01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:28.000]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:33:28.000 --> 01:33:33.000]  All right, I said this segment, I would get into this huge news,
[01:33:33.000 --> 01:33:40.000]  but I've been pulling more video clips and pulling more articles to back it up.
[01:33:40.000 --> 01:33:46.000]  Even though it's all confirmed now by two major, respected international news agencies
[01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:51.000]  of an incredible false flag that was staged in an attempt to basically trigger a massive war.
[01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:56.000]  And so I printed like two more big articles during the break,
[01:33:56.000 --> 01:34:02.000]  and I was, I've got to go over these a little bit more because this is so big that I want to,
[01:34:02.000 --> 01:34:05.000]  it's not that I have to don't know the facts or if I get my abduction in a row,
[01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:12.000]  this is so important that I need to sit in here and get focused during the next three, four minute break
[01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:16.000]  so I can do this properly and get locked and loaded to come into the next segment,
[01:34:16.000 --> 01:34:19.000]  but I will cover it next segment.
[01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:25.000]  So what happens around here is I'm looking at infowars.com, looking at newswars.com,
[01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:30.000]  and then I see video at newswars.com.
[01:34:30.000 --> 01:34:35.000]  And at europewars.com has exclusive of an elderly German couple forced from their home
[01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:39.000]  to accommodate illegal alien Muslims.
[01:34:39.000 --> 01:34:45.000]  And there's the video of it, just like we saw in Italy, old man thrown out of his hotel,
[01:34:45.000 --> 01:34:52.000]  his restaurant, his food, his life's work, only a 15 room hotel, little motel,
[01:34:52.000 --> 01:34:56.000]  and the North African Muslims put into it, he's crying,
[01:34:56.000 --> 01:35:00.000]  and the Italian police are just laughing, throwing him out on his ass.
[01:35:00.000 --> 01:35:02.000]  That's at europewars.com.
[01:35:02.000 --> 01:35:07.000]  This is the evil, this is World War 4, this is the globalist invasion.
[01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:10.000]  This is how they're carrying it out.
[01:35:10.000 --> 01:35:14.000]  Also, Peter Schiff joins us 15 minutes to the next hour on the economy,
[01:35:14.000 --> 01:35:17.000]  and Trump and Alexandria Cortez and more, you don't want to miss that with the head of
[01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:22.000]  the global Pacific capital, Luis Martí.
[01:35:22.000 --> 01:35:28.000]  And then I'm not bringing this up to go after Joe Rogan.
[01:35:28.000 --> 01:35:36.000]  I'm bringing it up because he's the darling of Google and the darling of Apple and all this.
[01:35:36.000 --> 01:35:39.000]  When they tell info wars, you're not welcome here,
[01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:43.000]  and then they tell natural news that already had apps and has hundreds of sites,
[01:35:43.000 --> 01:35:46.000]  and has as much traffic as we do combined with all their sites.
[01:35:46.000 --> 01:35:52.000]  Oh, if you mention abortion, or you mentioned Satanism, or you mentioned illegal aliens,
[01:35:52.000 --> 01:35:54.000]  we're not going to let you have an app.
[01:35:54.000 --> 01:35:58.000]  I mean, now they've gone from denying censorship to, oh, by the way, to have an app,
[01:35:58.000 --> 01:36:01.000]  remove these articles off your site, we'll let you have an app.
[01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:04.000]  That is so sensationally evil.
[01:36:04.000 --> 01:36:08.000]  We put up with it because as conservatives and nationalists, we muddle through things.
[01:36:08.000 --> 01:36:10.000]  I'm not putting up with it.
[01:36:10.000 --> 01:36:13.000]  It's crazy.
[01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:17.000]  And Joe's up there defending all the censorship and saying it's okay.
[01:36:17.000 --> 01:36:20.000]  Now he's backed off, and Alex should have been banned, and it's wrong,
[01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:23.000]  and I believe disinfo, and Alex is okay.
[01:36:23.000 --> 01:36:28.000]  I want to be friends, Alex.
[01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:30.000]  A little late for that.
[01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:37.000]  Dude, I'm not attacking you because I want you to stop attacking me.
[01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:41.000]  I'm attacking you because you made the wrong decision and have been doing the wrong thing,
[01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:45.000]  and you're now part of the enemy's fleet.
[01:36:45.000 --> 01:36:53.000]  You're now on the high seas as an attack ship, a battleship, an aircraft carrier,
[01:36:53.000 --> 01:36:57.000]  and I'm a battered submarine captain with a few torpedoes left,
[01:36:57.000 --> 01:37:01.000]  and I'm going to take out big ships before they send me down to David Jones' locker.
[01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:05.000]  And my crew's ready.
[01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:09.000]  We've only got a few big torpedoes left, and we're not going to sink regular ships.
[01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:11.000]  We're not going to sink supply ships.
[01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:13.000]  We're not going to sink merchant marine ships.
[01:37:13.000 --> 01:37:16.000]  We're not going to sink frigates or corvettes.
[01:37:16.000 --> 01:37:18.000]  We're going to sink big ships.
[01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:21.000]  Joe, you're a big ship.
[01:37:21.000 --> 01:37:29.000]  We're going to rise up to the surface, and those shipping lanes, we're looking for your signature.
[01:37:29.000 --> 01:37:31.000]  Lit by the moon and stars.
[01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:33.000]  And we're looking at our...
[01:37:33.000 --> 01:37:35.000]  Hi, that's the ship.
[01:37:35.000 --> 01:37:36.000]  Load torpedoes.
[01:37:36.000 --> 01:37:41.000]  Flood tubes one and two. Fire! Fire!
[01:37:41.000 --> 01:37:43.000]  Don't you understand, you're in a war now, Joe.
[01:37:43.000 --> 01:37:45.000]  You're in an info war.
[01:37:45.000 --> 01:37:52.000]  Submarine, big blast holes all over its deck, patched up system.
[01:37:52.000 --> 01:37:58.000]  When we come to the surface, Joe, we've got torpedoes armed and loaded.
[01:37:58.000 --> 01:38:02.000]  I actually got a couple hundred torpedoes left.
[01:38:02.000 --> 01:38:08.000]  But I assigned two to Joe Rogan.
[01:38:08.000 --> 01:38:13.000]  Dauntless and victory.
[01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:15.000]  I kissed the torpedoes.
[01:38:15.000 --> 01:38:18.000]  I oiled the torpedoes.
[01:38:18.000 --> 01:38:21.000]  And we haven't even released the main torpedoes yet.
[01:38:21.000 --> 01:38:28.000]  We have an extreme arsenal, and it's not about gloating, but if you're going to do it, you might as well gloat.
[01:38:28.000 --> 01:38:36.000]  Instead of feeling guilty about destroying old friends who've destroyed themselves, one must take a little sick victory in it.
[01:38:36.000 --> 01:38:39.000]  That's why God made us that way, so we wouldn't go crazy.
[01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:44.000]  Oh, that's not Christlike. You know, this big preacher up in Dallas, I forget his name, I've seen his sermon, he's a pretty good guy.
[01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:48.000]  It was on infowars.com today, but you guys printed it, I know I didn't look at all the stuff.
[01:38:48.000 --> 01:39:00.000]  He's like you soulless, weak, dumb, fake evangelicals who, because Ted Cruz and Glenn Beck told you that Ted Cruz was the second coming of Jehovah,
[01:39:00.000 --> 01:39:08.000]  and that Trump was the devil, you still hate Trump, even though he's in pro-life marches, he's trying to restrict abortion,
[01:39:08.000 --> 01:39:14.000]  he's actually doing what he said he would do, and he's trying to get the IRS off the backs of churches to have the First Amendment,
[01:39:14.000 --> 01:39:18.000]  something Trump's actually done that's good.
[01:39:18.000 --> 01:39:22.000]  How are you for the Democrats that say kill babies after they're born?
[01:39:22.000 --> 01:39:27.000]  There's no debate that you should support Trump. It's on infowars.com.
[01:39:27.000 --> 01:39:30.000]  It's a top evangelical megachurch, there it is.
[01:39:30.000 --> 01:39:35.000]  Spinalis morons, Dallas megachurch pastor rips, never Trump evangelicals.
[01:39:35.000 --> 01:39:38.000]  Well, you know why they don't do it, because they don't want the IRS to come after him.
[01:39:38.000 --> 01:39:42.000]  In fact, print that for me, please.
[01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:49.000]  Oh, let me tell you, they're going to have deep stake on that man's trash tomorrow morning.
[01:39:49.000 --> 01:39:56.000]  And that's why other preachers won't stand up and do their job, because they get threatened, and they just want to be up there with their jumbo trons
[01:39:56.000 --> 01:40:00.000]  and get up in front of an audience of people and feel like they're in Hollywood.
[01:40:00.000 --> 01:40:06.000]  Well, everybody wants to be on TV, so if I can't be a person in Hollywood,
[01:40:06.000 --> 01:40:12.000]  I'm going to be a pastor, or I'm going to be a news reporter.
[01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:15.000]  But you see, that's Robert Jeffries, or Jeffers.
[01:40:15.000 --> 01:40:22.000]  I didn't get into media to be a twinkled bug.
[01:40:22.000 --> 01:40:24.000]  I got into media.
[01:40:24.000 --> 01:40:26.000]  Well, please get him off.
[01:40:26.000 --> 01:40:28.000]  Talk about American psycho. Good Lord.
[01:40:28.000 --> 01:40:36.000]  I got into it because they were trying to pass bills 25 years ago.
[01:40:36.000 --> 01:40:42.000]  25 years ago, that we're going to ban people under 18 being able to touch a gun,
[01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:46.000]  even with their dad or their grandfather or their mother or grandmother,
[01:40:46.000 --> 01:40:50.000]  and was going to ban 4-8 shooting clubs and YMCA shooting clubs.
[01:40:50.000 --> 01:40:52.000]  And I just had to go down.
[01:40:52.000 --> 01:40:58.000]  And I went to city council, and I went to county commissure, and I had left that threatened me,
[01:40:58.000 --> 01:41:01.000]  that they'd kick my ass if I tried to speak again.
[01:41:01.000 --> 01:41:03.000]  And I never forget it.
[01:41:03.000 --> 01:41:06.000]  I said, well, let's go outside. I'll beat your ass.
[01:41:06.000 --> 01:41:10.000]  And they couldn't believe it, because most people, there were no conservatives there.
[01:41:10.000 --> 01:41:13.000]  There were no Americans. I was like, my God, what the hell's going on here?
[01:41:13.000 --> 01:41:15.000]  There's like a bunch of communists in here.
[01:41:15.000 --> 01:41:19.000]  And so I'm like, I'm trying to get jobs and talk radio, and I'm trying to, you know,
[01:41:19.000 --> 01:41:22.000]  I go on my intern, and people make fun of me and everything else.
[01:41:22.000 --> 01:41:24.000]  And I'm just trying to get on there to warn people.
[01:41:24.000 --> 01:41:26.000]  And then there's the guy that's got the show.
[01:41:26.000 --> 01:41:29.000]  He's like strutting in, and the intern's groveling.
[01:41:29.000 --> 01:41:33.000]  And it's all this weird hierarchy of ass kissing and all this fake stuff.
[01:41:33.000 --> 01:41:40.000]  It's like, we're not on air to pull up in the new car and show off to everybody.
[01:41:40.000 --> 01:41:44.000]  If you stand up for freedom, there'll be new cars growing on trees, dumbass.
[01:41:44.000 --> 01:41:50.000]  That's a product of success and freedom, not the symbol of it.
[01:41:54.000 --> 01:41:57.000]  And so the system thinks they're going to take everything I've got away
[01:41:57.000 --> 01:42:03.000]  and then I would somehow be broken or capitulate. I came from nothing.
[01:42:03.000 --> 01:42:06.000]  Ashes to ashes, dust to dust.
[01:42:06.000 --> 01:42:12.000]  And you think about that twit governor with his evil effeminate voice
[01:42:12.000 --> 01:42:21.000]  slurping and smacking demonically about keep him comfortable when he gets their organs.
[01:42:21.000 --> 01:42:24.000]  How do we not stand up for those unborn babies?
[01:42:24.000 --> 01:42:26.000]  It's not. Don't thank me. It's not.
[01:42:26.000 --> 01:42:28.000]  Oh Alex, you're so great. You're so heroic.
[01:42:28.000 --> 01:42:32.000]  Heroic? When doctors are on TV that are governors
[01:42:32.000 --> 01:42:36.000]  talking about killing babies that were born?
[01:42:36.000 --> 01:42:38.000]  I'm not heroic.
[01:42:38.000 --> 01:42:41.000]  I'm not a lunatic. What's going on?
[01:42:41.000 --> 01:42:45.000]  Son of a bitch is dangerous. He's a damn murderer.
[01:42:45.000 --> 01:42:51.000]  He's an enemy. He's cancer. Cut that son of a bitch out.
[01:42:51.000 --> 01:42:57.000]  What the hell are we talking about here? Where are our instincts? Where's our spirit?
[01:42:57.000 --> 01:43:15.000]  By leaps and by bounds, the number one best selling supplement family in the world is energy drinks and energy supplements.
[01:43:15.000 --> 01:43:22.000]  But they are riddled with dyes and toxins and synthetic caffeine and other chemicals that sure get you a quick boost
[01:43:22.000 --> 01:43:25.000]  but burn out in just a few hours and have terrible side effects.
[01:43:25.000 --> 01:43:34.000]  We have developed, hands down from our research, the most powerful, healthy energy drink, pre-workout and beyond system in the world.
[01:43:34.000 --> 01:43:37.000]  There's nothing else like it. You must experience it.
[01:43:37.000 --> 01:43:44.000]  It is a total game changer and it comes in easy to use, packaged, mixed in with fruit juice or water, whatever you'd like.
[01:43:44.000 --> 01:43:47.000]  Warning though, it's very, very strong. It lasts up to 10 hours.
[01:43:47.000 --> 01:43:54.000]  So take a half packet the first time you take it because Turboforce is named Turboforce because it will take you into overdrive.
[01:43:54.000 --> 01:43:57.000]  Turboforce and EnforceLive.com
[01:44:25.000 --> 01:44:30.000]  What we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater.
[01:44:30.000 --> 01:44:34.000]  Next, we tested the water from our Alexa pure gravity filter.
[01:44:34.000 --> 01:44:41.000]  And not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure, but the pH was also restored to optimal levels.
[01:44:41.000 --> 01:44:46.000]  As it turns out, the filter on the Alexa pure raises the pH of the water.
[01:44:46.000 --> 01:44:52.000]  So what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply.
[01:44:52.000 --> 01:44:57.000]  But more importantly, a good water filtration system will purify it.
[01:45:23.000 --> 01:45:29.000]  So I come to you each day and try to explain to you that this is a war of attrition.
[01:45:29.000 --> 01:45:35.000]  This is about who wants it most and you know the persecution, the censorship, the sponsors, they've taken everything.

[01:47:22.000 --> 01:47:34.000]  Okay, I'm a little bit behind. I keep saying I promise I'll get to this serious thing.
[01:47:34.000 --> 01:47:38.000]  But they gave me even more articles and more documents because I asked them to back more of it up.
[01:47:38.000 --> 01:47:47.000]  But just wait till I get to this and I promise that I will start it.
[01:47:47.000 --> 01:47:51.000]  You know what, I'll do it right now. I'll just do it right now.
[01:47:51.000 --> 01:47:54.000]  I'll do the Andrew McCabe stuff for two segments and then get Peter Schiff on.
[01:47:54.000 --> 01:48:07.000]  Because I wanted to do a deep dive on McCabe, the former FBI director, the guy that they had after Comey,
[01:48:07.000 --> 01:48:12.000]  or deputy director, and then I started remembering all the stuff he did.
[01:48:12.000 --> 01:48:18.000]  And it was like, oh, I forgot his wife got a half million dollars from Hillary, like the year of the fake investigation.
[01:48:18.000 --> 01:48:24.000]  I forgot all the Russiagate stuff. It's like, really? You know, it's crazy.
[01:48:24.000 --> 01:48:28.000]  Like you just know he's a bad guy. You go back and kind of review it.
[01:48:28.000 --> 01:48:35.000]  Like, hey, get me all the stuff on him. It's like, Lord, I don't feel like I should even talk about McCabe.
[01:48:35.000 --> 01:48:47.000]  Because this is all so bad that I can't come up with words to properly demonize him.
[01:48:47.000 --> 01:48:53.000]  But he has that earnest little look and a little doggie.
[01:48:53.000 --> 01:49:00.000]  Well, I don't want to hear what you look like or what you say. I want to see what you deliver.
[01:49:00.000 --> 01:49:07.000]  I want to see the outcome of what you say. And you, McCabe, support the globalist.
[01:49:07.000 --> 01:49:13.000]  You support coverups for Hillary. You support the deep state and the overrunning of our country and MS-13 running around.
[01:49:13.000 --> 01:49:22.000]  All this crap. And you and Rosenstein lied to Congress. I can't help it. I'm doing him now.
[01:49:22.000 --> 01:49:33.000]  You lied to Congress and that little ventriloquist tall Rosenstein and Comey.
[01:49:33.000 --> 01:49:38.000]  He looks like a ventriloquist tall. What is it that these guys are creepy looking?
[01:49:38.000 --> 01:49:43.000]  Like some eight foot tall weirdo that grew on other planet or something.
[01:49:43.000 --> 01:49:48.000]  Thanks for casting.
[01:49:48.000 --> 01:49:56.000]  So he goes on 60 Minutes and, oh, oh, the White House. It's a new low every day. Oh, it's so horrible.
[01:49:56.000 --> 01:50:07.000]  Why Trump wants to go back to pre-Obama where they tested people for leprosy and black plague and smallpox and drug-resistant TB?
[01:50:07.000 --> 01:50:16.000]  Oh, no, we can't do that. We have to limit the beds and then tell everyone collapse America and have five million on their way.
[01:50:16.000 --> 01:50:23.000]  And then God forbid you check anybody. Okay, well, next time I go to Europe or next time I go to Mexico or next time I go to Costa Rica,
[01:50:23.000 --> 01:50:27.000]  I'm going to fly into customs and I'm going to do it. I'm going to get my camera on.
[01:50:27.000 --> 01:50:33.000]  I'm going to say, hey, I'm going to just run and jump over the customs thing.
[01:50:33.000 --> 01:50:39.000]  And I'm going to chant no border, no wall in the USA at all.
[01:50:39.000 --> 01:50:50.000]  You know, I'd do that to illustrate it, but I guarantee you I would get charged with a felony attempting to jump the border.
[01:50:50.000 --> 01:50:56.000]  Because that's what borders are. They're like bulkheads on ships.
[01:50:56.000 --> 01:51:08.000]  So I can't do that because I'm a lowly citizen. But I've seen border policy where they let illegal aliens in that have like pieces of paper in Spanish.
[01:51:08.000 --> 01:51:16.000]  And they go, all right, come on in. I get up there. Well, Alex Jones, where you been? Cancun for six days.
[01:51:16.000 --> 01:51:21.000]  Did you buy anything? Got any merchandise? Yeah, I bought my wife a watch.
[01:51:21.000 --> 01:51:28.000]  How much was it? I think $2,000. How much was that exactly? Well, the receipts here. Yeah, let's go behind closed doors.
[01:51:28.000 --> 01:51:32.000]  Mr. Jones, we're going to have you sit back here for 45 minutes.
[01:51:32.000 --> 01:51:38.000]  Then we're going to come back with a couple guys and stand around you and other people saying, we're sorry, Alex, we're fans, but these are the leftists.
[01:51:38.000 --> 01:51:44.000]  See, it's little gangs. Well, let's just dump. See what's in here.
[01:51:44.000 --> 01:51:52.000]  And the head guy goes, I'm sorry. And they got the receipt $2,011.
[01:51:52.000 --> 01:51:58.000]  But the point is, is that's what third world countries are like, because I never even buy stuff.
[01:51:58.000 --> 01:52:03.000]  But you're walking around in Mexico and there's a watch shop tag and Rolex.
[01:52:03.000 --> 01:52:11.000]  You could go buy your wife a tag watch. Oh, baby, let's go in here. Oh, I don't want anything. Oh, let's just go in. Oh, you like that watch? We'll get it.
[01:52:11.000 --> 01:52:16.000]  They're all acting weird and paranoid, putting our name down and like, you'll resettle this?
[01:52:16.000 --> 01:52:22.000]  I'm like, actually, I'm with the watch. There's like guys with machine guns standing outside the door and it's like, why am I even down here?
[01:52:22.000 --> 01:52:28.000]  You know, it's like, but that's what I'm talking about. It's crazy.
[01:52:28.000 --> 01:52:36.000]  I have been drugged behind customs. My parents, about a third of the time, they love to go to Europe twice a year.
[01:52:36.000 --> 01:52:44.000]  They go to England, they go to Holland, they go to Germany, they go to France, they go to Italy, they go to Greece.
[01:52:44.000 --> 01:52:51.000]  About a third of the time, they get singled out and drugged behind closed doors and asked, do you have anything illegal?
[01:52:51.000 --> 01:53:00.000]  And they just pour through their crap. Oh, but if you want to stop people coming in and just see who they are when they're climbing over a fence,
[01:53:00.000 --> 01:53:08.000]  it's the greatest evil we've ever seen in our lives. But if you're a veteran with your both legs and your arm blown off,
[01:53:08.000 --> 01:53:12.000]  we're going to have to stick our hands in your pants now, sir.
[01:53:12.000 --> 01:53:18.000]  Half the time it's a jihadi doing it. I'm tired of it. You know, I can't go to Somalia.
[01:53:18.000 --> 01:53:23.000]  There's not a working airport, but they, they, they, it's, it's, it's document.
[01:53:23.000 --> 01:53:30.000]  I know top Hollywood producers are afraid to go there to try to do an undercover deal. They can't even get special operations to go in there because they're not authorized to.
[01:53:30.000 --> 01:53:37.000]  You go off the few U.S. military bases there for five minutes, five minutes.
[01:53:37.000 --> 01:53:46.000]  You're walking down the street in Somalia. A Toyota minivan pulls up, 1989, purple minivan, you know, this is,
[01:53:46.000 --> 01:53:53.000]  and you're in the vehicle with people going, I kill you in for that. I literally might rape you.
[01:53:53.000 --> 01:54:00.000]  I mean, it's just, it's, it's hellish. And then you'll be driven off to someplace you're kidnapped in five minutes.
[01:54:00.000 --> 01:54:08.000]  And I got to see some woman up there bitching about how much America sucks and how oppressive it is as a congresswoman.
[01:54:08.000 --> 01:54:16.000]  And in Somalia, women are lower than whale crap. And I'm just not putting up with it anymore.
[01:54:16.000 --> 01:54:21.000]  And I'm not putting up with the cave or comey or Muller and all their intimidation.
[01:54:21.000 --> 01:54:25.000]  I don't give a damn what you do to me, but you bastards are going down.
[01:54:25.000 --> 01:54:37.000]  I'm so sick of you bringing in the worst people in your big ritual to crap all over this Christian nation.
[01:54:37.000 --> 01:54:44.000]  I want you to burn in hell. And I pray everyone prays that no violence comes upon you from man,
[01:54:44.000 --> 01:54:54.000]  but I pray God puts big old giant brain tumors and bone tumors and liver tumors and blood tumors in every damn last one of you globalists.
[01:54:54.000 --> 01:55:02.000]  I'm asking God to kill you. You want to kill those unborn babies. You want to kill those babies that were just born.
[01:55:02.000 --> 01:55:08.000]  You want to sit there and piss in our faces when I'm telling God you're a post birth abortion.
[01:55:08.000 --> 01:55:14.000]  I'm saying to God I want judgment.
[01:55:14.000 --> 01:55:25.000]  You smiley face back slapping pieces of crap that figured out some new industry you've got to sell baby organs.
[01:55:25.000 --> 01:55:35.000]  You know God ain't going to kill you. God's going to put brain tumors in your children. Guarantee that's how God works.
[01:55:35.000 --> 01:55:45.000]  Yeah, you know it, don't you? You hate me because I've seen the angel of death.
[01:55:45.000 --> 01:56:01.000]  The angel of death got your name written on it. Your curse to hell. And people need to start realizing that this whole planet's about a choice.
[01:56:01.000 --> 01:56:08.000]  And people need to make a choice which side they're on. But I'm far beyond revenue.
[01:56:08.000 --> 01:56:19.000]  People say oh this is intense. They're on television smacking their demonic lips about killing already born babies
[01:56:19.000 --> 01:56:27.000]  that they could adopt for $200,000 on average. But they want to kill them.
[01:56:27.000 --> 01:56:39.000]  You know the demonic thrill somebody like Governor Northup gets when he keeps that baby alive and takes their organs and gets all the rest of that scum on board.
[01:56:39.000 --> 01:56:44.000]  That's a big giant satanic ritual.
[01:56:44.000 --> 01:56:58.000]  Then in the satanic video game he's playing lesser magic dressing up in blackface or KKK which was very Prasada Nangrata in 1984.
[01:56:58.000 --> 01:57:07.000]  That's lesser magic. That's pissing in your face. But when you can get on TV and convince women to kill their babies after they're born,
[01:57:07.000 --> 01:57:18.000]  let me tell you something. That's right up Satan's alley. That Satanism pure bona fide.
[01:57:18.000 --> 01:57:22.000]  Doesn't get any more real than that.
[01:57:22.000 --> 01:57:33.000]  So yes, I'm not just a submarine loaded for war ready to take down their capital ships. I am the torpedo.
[01:57:33.000 --> 01:57:44.000]  It's so are you. And the minute you're willing to go the full length is the minute you start living.

[01:58:55.000 --> 01:59:01.000]  I'm not sitting here selling you cancer cures. I'm not sitting here, you know, selling you late term abortion and all the great it is.
[01:59:01.000 --> 01:59:07.000]  I just go out and say, what is the top heart pill? What is the top tumor? It's the best seller because it's anti-inflammatory.
[01:59:07.000 --> 01:59:10.000]  And what's the best lab in the country? OK, they're the highest rated.
[01:59:10.000 --> 01:59:16.000]  I'm like, you're only 50% curcuminoid? Well, yeah, they only put $5 product and bottle, but that's still incredible, sir.
[01:59:16.000 --> 01:59:19.000]  I'm like, what's the hottest you could do a month later?
[01:59:19.000 --> 01:59:25.000]  90, 95%. No one's ever done it. I said, how much does that cost for a bottle? It costs $10. No one's ever done that.
[01:59:25.000 --> 01:59:32.000]  Sir, the average competitor is 3% to 5%. The top brand is 50%. I'm like, we're going to have 95% curcuminoid.
[01:59:32.000 --> 01:59:38.000]  I mean, you understand, like, that's like our information is explosive. Our fish oil. I go out and I get the cleanest, the best.
[01:59:38.000 --> 01:59:43.000]  My children take it. You think I'm going to give you fish oil that isn't the very damn best on my soul?
[01:59:43.000 --> 01:59:47.000]  You think I'm going to screw somebody over like one of these devil worshipers? Never.

[01:59:48.000 --> 01:59:53.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[02:00:07.000 --> 02:00:13.000]  The preacher man says it's the end of time and the Mississippi River, she's a gold grind.
[02:00:13.000 --> 02:00:19.000]  All right, I'll finish up on Captain Ding Dong McCabe.
[02:00:21.000 --> 02:00:25.000]  And then we'll get into the big news and I'm 30 minutes behind on hitting.
[02:00:36.000 --> 02:00:40.000]  That's all I want to do. I don't want to be on air, folks. You know that, just like you don't.
[02:00:40.000 --> 02:00:47.000]  I just want to be in the foothills, some mountains, be a farmer, just be friends with the locals,
[02:00:47.000 --> 02:00:55.000]  sit around on Friday night, folks having a cold beer around the fire, a little bit of square dancing.
[02:00:55.000 --> 02:01:05.000]  I can fly a field all day long. I can catch catfish from dust. And most of us are only one generation or two generations out of that.
[02:01:05.000 --> 02:01:15.000]  Just look at those people. They were so alive. People were dialed into the earth and died. They were weird.
[02:01:15.000 --> 02:01:28.000]  And now they fear it. And if they can stuff that out, get everybody doing the soy boy, I think they're going to win.
[02:01:28.000 --> 02:01:31.000]  Because they want to be able to starve us out.
[02:01:37.000 --> 02:01:41.000]  You can't starve us out. You don't run our life. We're self-sufficient.
[02:01:41.000 --> 02:01:45.000]  And we're willing to fight. You can't make us run.
[02:01:55.000 --> 02:01:58.000]  Alright, let's get to treason right now.
[02:01:58.000 --> 02:02:07.000]  Donald Trump says many of the top FBI brass were fired, forced to leave or left. McCabe's wife received big dollars.
[02:02:07.000 --> 02:02:11.000]  Half a million from Clinton people for a campaign. It was from Hillary, actually.
[02:02:11.000 --> 02:02:18.000]  He gave Hillary a pass. McCabe has disgraced the FBI and disgraced our country, make America great again.
[02:02:18.000 --> 02:02:23.000]  And then you read all the new stuff that Congress is releasing. We get snow coverage where FBI comes in and says,
[02:02:23.000 --> 02:02:42.000]  yeah, Hillary has thousands of classified emails. Each one is a seven-year to ten-year felony. We'll let you change them to non-classified, which is absconding and fraud and obstruction and wire fraud and forgery.
[02:02:42.000 --> 02:02:55.000]  They write memos and say, but I want that plum London position or I want the chief job in Switzerland.
[02:02:55.000 --> 02:03:04.000]  And by the way, we hire my wife. You're just like, God, this is who we've got?
[02:03:04.000 --> 02:03:14.000]  And then McCabe sits up there on 60 Minutes about how Trump's corrupt and what a good person he is. What a joke.
[02:03:14.000 --> 02:03:21.000]  He's under criminal investigation by grand juries for line of Congress. Let's play a clip of it right now.
[02:03:21.000 --> 02:03:37.000]  I was speaking to the man who had just run for the presidency. I was speaking to the woman that just sold us out to Russia and Benghazi and the fake server.
[02:03:37.000 --> 02:04:03.000]  I was speaking to the man who had just run for the presidency and won the election for the presidency and who might have done so with the aid of the government of Russia, our most formidable adversary.
[02:04:03.000 --> 02:04:16.000]  Pause again. No, it's China. Shut up. You lying sack of crap. You're on the payroll of Russia, you little bastard.
[02:04:16.000 --> 02:04:24.000]  You're on the payroll. You're the straighter. You. You're the party of hate America. Let's continue.
[02:04:24.000 --> 02:04:27.000]  And that was something that troubled me greatly.
[02:04:27.000 --> 02:04:33.000]  How long was it after that that you decided to start the obstruction of justice and counterintelligence?
[02:04:33.000 --> 02:04:57.000]  I mean, can you get any more? How long was it until you decided you want to take myself? Imagine if I did the show like, how long was it until you take action immediately?
[02:05:04.000 --> 02:05:14.000]  By leaps and by bounds, the number one best selling supplement family in the world is energy drinks and energy supplements.
[02:05:14.000 --> 02:05:24.000]  But they are riddled with dyes and toxins and synthetic caffeine and other chemicals that sure get you a quick boost but burn out in just a few hours and have terrible side effects.
[02:05:24.000 --> 02:05:33.000]  We have developed hands down from our research, the most powerful, healthy energy drink, pre-workout and beyond system in the world.
[02:05:33.000 --> 02:05:43.000]  There's nothing else like it. You must experience it. It is a total game changer and it comes in easy to use, packaged, mixed in with fruit juice or water, whatever you'd like.
[02:05:43.000 --> 02:05:53.000]  Warning though, it's very, very strong. It lasts 10 hours. So take a half packet the first time you take it because Turbo Force is named Turbo Force because it will take you into overdrive.
[02:05:53.000 --> 02:05:55.000]  Turbo Force and M4sLive.com
[02:06:24.000 --> 02:06:28.000]  So let's get right into it.
[02:06:28.000 --> 02:06:33.000]  Now into the third hour, thank you for joining us on Alex Jones, M4s.com, NewsWars.com.
[02:06:33.000 --> 02:06:51.000]  It is an act of defiance. It is an act of rebellion against tyranny and the child killing demonic, globalist, Democrat infestation when you stand up for M4 Wars, when you stand up for NewsWars, when you stand up for America, when you stand up for decency, when you don't give it to the bullying.
[02:06:51.000 --> 02:07:04.000]  And the more you do it, it's easier and easier and easier until you can't believe how easy it always was and why weren't you always there now.
[02:07:04.000 --> 02:07:13.000]  Let me get to the news that I've been talking about all day long. It's so amazing because we're going to roll some of the footage for TV viewers while I talk about it.
[02:07:13.000 --> 02:07:22.000]  But if you go back a couple of years ago, there's been five or six chemical attacks and our own governments come out the Pentagon later in the UN.
[02:07:22.000 --> 02:07:33.000]  Everybody said, well, looks like ISIS or Al Qaeda launched these chemical attacks because ISIS and Al Qaeda want to be movie stars in the Islamic world.
[02:07:33.000 --> 02:07:39.000]  So they had given the chemical weapons by Saudi Arabia before Trump made Saudi Arabia stand down.
[02:07:39.000 --> 02:07:44.000]  Saudi Arabia is now coming out of the dark. At least we hope. I'm supporting the president, hoping that happens.
[02:07:44.000 --> 02:07:52.000]  I don't want to have war with Saudi Arabia. I'm not against Saudi Arabia, just as long as they don't engage in evil overtly against us.
[02:07:52.000 --> 02:07:58.000]  But Obama funded ISIS, Al Qaeda through Saudi Arabia, this whole destabilization.
[02:07:58.000 --> 02:08:02.000]  Let's show you one of the famous footage of the kids, fake shaking, fake chemical attack.
[02:08:02.000 --> 02:08:10.000]  Because I don't need to be a rocket scientist when I'm watching footage.
[02:08:10.000 --> 02:08:17.000]  But there's all this famous footage where the doctor's like, he's not a doctor, he's like 18 years old.
[02:08:17.000 --> 02:08:27.000]  He's like, oh, look, and then he fake falls over. We've shown that footage many, many times. We'll show it in a minute.
[02:08:27.000 --> 02:08:32.000]  But then it was on the news that kids had died.
[02:08:32.000 --> 02:08:37.000]  And then later they're back on TV saying, no, we were in the village, the UN came and said, we'll give you money.
[02:08:37.000 --> 02:08:43.000]  We'll give you candy bars. We'll give you money. We'll give you peanut butter. Just come here.
[02:08:43.000 --> 02:08:48.000]  They douse them with water and they do the shoots and then they edit it. They put it out.
[02:08:48.000 --> 02:08:53.000]  So it is crisis actors, but they just recruit from the general public.
[02:08:53.000 --> 02:08:58.000]  We've always known that.
[02:08:58.000 --> 02:09:04.000]  But now we have three different news agencies. I was saying two.
[02:09:04.000 --> 02:09:12.000]  We have the BBC and two other agencies saying they've done six month and year long investigations
[02:09:12.000 --> 02:09:17.000]  and they found the people that supposedly died and it's all true that it was staged.
[02:09:17.000 --> 02:09:22.000]  Well, yeah, Obama says red line, you cross this, we invade. The globalists want to take over Syria.
[02:09:22.000 --> 02:09:26.000]  So obviously they're going to stage it. Why would Assad ever do something that's going to get him invaded?
[02:09:26.000 --> 02:09:30.000]  If that's the one thing, they'll get him invaded.
[02:09:30.000 --> 02:09:41.000]  So BBC producer says footage of alleged gas attack victims in Syria staged.
[02:09:41.000 --> 02:09:49.000]  And then it goes to the reporter. A BBC Syria producer has said that footage of people being treated after an alleged chemical weapons attack
[02:09:49.000 --> 02:09:59.000]  in the Syrian city of Doma was staged.
[02:09:59.000 --> 02:10:08.000]  The journalist pointed out that no fatalities had occurred at the hospital adding that the attack on Doma had happened,
[02:10:08.000 --> 02:10:14.000]  but Sharon had not been used there. However, the reporter noted that the organization for the prohibition of chemical weapons
[02:10:14.000 --> 02:10:20.000]  would look into whether chlorine was used to see. And then it just goes on from there.
[02:10:20.000 --> 02:10:27.000]  BBC producer says footage of alleged gas attack in victims in Syria Doma staged.
[02:10:27.000 --> 02:10:34.000]  BBC trying to limit damage after fake news of Syria chemical attack reported.
[02:10:34.000 --> 02:10:39.000]  When I saw all this to the asset, wait a minute, we already have the UN admitting this and other attacks.
[02:10:39.000 --> 02:10:52.000]  We already have other journalists with other newspapers that were there and said, no, it was all staged.
[02:10:52.000 --> 02:10:58.000]  So again, this is what they're doing. So here's the famous footage. We can play audio of this. That'd be great.
[02:10:58.000 --> 02:11:04.000]  You've got the so-called doctor sitting here and he looks at the camera. It's like, get ready, get ready.
[02:11:04.000 --> 02:11:09.000]  The kids are doing their fake legs flopping and they stop and start.
[02:11:09.000 --> 02:11:15.000]  He looks at the camera. Then he falls down.
[02:11:15.000 --> 02:11:22.000]  Oh, I mean, a third grader play is better.
[02:11:22.000 --> 02:11:31.000]  So I don't need to hear the UN say or hear our military say or hear the BBC say or the one independent say.
[02:11:31.000 --> 02:11:36.000]  I mean, I know fake when I mean, look at this. Let's play it again.
[02:11:36.000 --> 02:11:39.000]  Oh, he's like, ready?
[02:11:39.000 --> 02:11:52.000]  The kids are like, oh, and so how am I not supposed to question when they launched the original Iraq war saying baby's brains were bashed out.
[02:11:52.000 --> 02:11:57.000]  It turned out it was all fake.
[02:11:57.000 --> 02:12:01.000]  And they play the sad music over it. We must attack Syria.
[02:12:01.000 --> 02:12:04.000]  We must go after Assad now.
[02:12:04.000 --> 02:12:07.000]  He is none of guessing children as we speak.
[02:12:07.000 --> 02:12:10.000]  This is the dramatic footage you're seeing.
[02:12:10.000 --> 02:12:13.000]  In fact, look, brought to you by CNN.
[02:12:13.000 --> 02:12:21.000]  Look, Syrian regime are highly likely to blame for chemical attack.
[02:12:21.000 --> 02:12:33.000]  UK sits and they show you a baby in a photo op. Why would Assad be winning not using chemical weapons to do it? Turns out they staged it.
[02:12:33.000 --> 02:12:37.000]  So that's why they're so freaked out.
[02:12:37.000 --> 02:12:39.000]  That's why they don't know what to do.
[02:12:39.000 --> 02:12:48.000]  And all the leftist public case like the Guardian nerve Asian experts race to smuggle bodies out of Doma and they never find chemicals in them.
[02:12:48.000 --> 02:12:54.000]  And then I've got all the articles one independent from previous attacks.
[02:12:54.000 --> 02:12:57.000]  Previous attacks.
[02:12:57.000 --> 02:13:02.000]  And one independent they went there. People were there whenever they said no, there was no chemical attack.
[02:13:02.000 --> 02:13:05.000]  There was some fighting on the main road.
[02:13:05.000 --> 02:13:08.000]  A few cars have been blown up. Yeah, some shells have been fired.
[02:13:08.000 --> 02:13:11.000]  People on both sides are dead. There's no chemicals.
[02:13:11.000 --> 02:13:14.000]  But that's what I'm saying.
[02:13:14.000 --> 02:13:19.000]  That's how evil all the system. Listen, I don't need to hear any of that.
[02:13:19.000 --> 02:13:23.000]  Let's play for TV viewers again before radio listeners.
[02:13:23.000 --> 02:13:27.000]  It's like if I had a toy gun playing with my kids has a red end on it.
[02:13:27.000 --> 02:13:33.000]  And I went bang and my son goes, oh, in the heart. I'm dead. Oh, gosh.
[02:13:33.000 --> 02:13:36.000]  It's not real. You know, fake when you see it.
[02:13:36.000 --> 02:13:39.000]  So you've got like 18 year old doctors.
[02:13:39.000 --> 02:13:44.000]  And no one else fall. And then other people and the kids are like looking.
[02:13:44.000 --> 02:13:48.000]  They go, do it. And they go, they flop around some more.
[02:13:48.000 --> 02:13:53.000]  Doesn't mean they're having real chemical attacks.
[02:13:53.000 --> 02:13:58.000]  Because early on, ISIS and Al Qaeda launched real chemical attacks.
[02:13:58.000 --> 02:14:03.000]  But then those didn't work because they shot videos celebrating it.
[02:14:03.000 --> 02:14:06.000]  So now they went in the last few years to fake.
[02:14:06.000 --> 02:14:09.000]  I mean, if you're not a radio listener, if you're a TV viewer, you just saw it.
[02:14:09.000 --> 02:14:11.000]  The radio listeners, you're missing it.
[02:14:11.000 --> 02:14:13.000]  Give a word.
[02:14:13.000 --> 02:14:15.000]  And then now the other doctors.
[02:14:15.000 --> 02:14:21.000]  Oh, I mean, can you fall down for real here?
[02:14:21.000 --> 02:14:24.000]  Oh, you got me.
[02:14:24.000 --> 02:14:30.000]  Oh, it's as fake as a $3 bill.
[02:14:30.000 --> 02:14:32.000]  But they don't want us on air.
[02:14:32.000 --> 02:14:37.000]  They can play the music.
[02:14:37.000 --> 02:14:40.000]  Oh, the chemical attack.
[02:14:40.000 --> 02:14:44.000]  I love my, hello, Dr. Salama.
[02:14:44.000 --> 02:14:47.000]  Oh, I've been lucky to love you.
[02:14:47.000 --> 02:14:48.000]  And here are the children.
[02:14:48.000 --> 02:14:53.000]  Oh, thank you.
[02:14:53.000 --> 02:14:55.000]  Oh, thank you.
[02:14:55.000 --> 02:14:58.000]  Meanwhile, ISIS and Al Qaeda are launching real chemical attacks.
[02:14:58.000 --> 02:15:00.000]  Meanwhile, they're making kids suicide bomb.
[02:15:00.000 --> 02:15:02.000]  Meanwhile, they're truck bombing for real.
[02:15:02.000 --> 02:15:06.000]  Meanwhile, the West is funding the takedown of countries that didn't attack us
[02:15:06.000 --> 02:15:09.000]  to put this type of crap into control.
[02:15:09.000 --> 02:15:11.000]  The video's up on infowars.com.
[02:15:11.000 --> 02:15:18.000]  BBC producer says footage of alleged gas attack victims in Syrian Doma were staged.
[02:15:18.000 --> 02:15:20.000]  Period.
[02:15:20.000 --> 02:15:22.000]  So no wonder I question events.
[02:15:22.000 --> 02:15:26.000]  Aren't you glad we are?
[02:15:26.000 --> 02:15:29.000]  I hope there wasn't a real chemical attack.
[02:15:29.000 --> 02:15:33.000]  But then the very kid that dies in the video later says, they gave me candy.
[02:15:33.000 --> 02:15:35.000]  White helmet came.
[02:15:35.000 --> 02:15:38.000]  They gave me candy, put water, said, flop.
[02:15:38.000 --> 02:15:40.000]  So I flopped.
[02:15:40.000 --> 02:15:44.000]  And they said on national news, because he's a cute kid, on CNN, they're like,
[02:15:44.000 --> 02:15:46.000]  here's a child that died.
[02:15:46.000 --> 02:15:48.000]  No, he's not dead, CNN.
[02:15:48.000 --> 02:15:51.000]  And you don't want us on air to point out how you're fake news.
[02:15:51.000 --> 02:15:52.000]  You're the hoaxers.
[02:15:52.000 --> 02:15:54.000]  You're the fraud.

[02:20:24.000 --> 02:20:35.000]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:20:35.000 --> 02:20:39.000]  Peter Schiff's been pointing out a lot of things that are happening in the economy,
[02:20:39.000 --> 02:20:41.000]  what's happening to Alexandria and Cortez,
[02:20:41.000 --> 02:20:42.000]  and more.
[02:20:42.000 --> 02:20:45.000]  We'll talk to him from Europe and Pacific Capital here in just about a minute.
[02:20:45.000 --> 02:20:49.000]  But, wow, the story's up on Infowars.com,
[02:20:49.000 --> 02:20:50.000]  the BBC is reporting it,
[02:20:50.000 --> 02:20:52.000]  the London Independence reporting it,
[02:20:52.000 --> 02:20:53.000]  Sputnik's reporting it,
[02:20:53.000 --> 02:20:55.000]  but it's getting no traction.
[02:20:55.000 --> 02:20:58.000]  It confirms the UN reports and others from a year ago
[02:20:58.000 --> 02:21:03.000]  that the chemical attack in DOMA did not happen and was staged by the White Helmets.
[02:21:03.000 --> 02:21:06.000]  Well, we got the kids that supposedly died on video
[02:21:06.000 --> 02:21:10.000]  saying that it was staged a year ago.
[02:21:10.000 --> 02:21:12.000]  But see, when you've got stuff like this going on,
[02:21:12.000 --> 02:21:14.000]  that's why we have a right to question,
[02:21:14.000 --> 02:21:16.000]  because things do get staged,
[02:21:16.000 --> 02:21:19.000]  and they're trying to use this to invade Syria,
[02:21:19.000 --> 02:21:20.000]  which is a crazy idea.
[02:21:20.000 --> 02:21:23.000]  One of the best things Trump's doing is trying to get us out of Syria,
[02:21:23.000 --> 02:21:25.000]  trying to get us out of Afghanistan.
[02:21:25.000 --> 02:21:28.000]  We'll get Peter Schiff's take on that here right now.
[02:21:28.000 --> 02:21:30.000]  Peter from Europepack.com.
[02:21:30.000 --> 02:21:32.000]  I want to get into the economy with you.
[02:21:32.000 --> 02:21:36.000]  I want to get into your statements on Alexandria Cortez and the pie in the sky.
[02:21:36.000 --> 02:21:40.000]  She's selling in just about the general nature of things.
[02:21:40.000 --> 02:21:42.000]  Look, I'm not paid by Trump to say positive things about him.
[02:21:42.000 --> 02:21:45.000]  I like a lot of what he does. I hate a lot of what he does.
[02:21:45.000 --> 02:21:47.000]  He's not fighting censorship.
[02:21:47.000 --> 02:21:51.000]  He's doing a lot of things I don't like. He's doing a lot of things I do like.
[02:21:51.000 --> 02:21:55.000]  But regardless, you've been predicting that if things keep going down this line,
[02:21:55.000 --> 02:21:59.000]  we could have Trump lose and then get a bunch of socialists in,
[02:21:59.000 --> 02:22:01.000]  but then that'll get a patriot in four years later.
[02:22:01.000 --> 02:22:04.000]  But I see America in you, and you're right a lot of the time.
[02:22:04.000 --> 02:22:07.000]  In major polls, remember, we're kind of rejecting Cortez
[02:22:07.000 --> 02:22:11.000]  because she got so confident where we're going to ban cows and their farts
[02:22:11.000 --> 02:22:13.000]  and we're going to ban airplanes.
[02:22:13.000 --> 02:22:15.000]  And if you don't want to work, you don't have to work.
[02:22:15.000 --> 02:22:17.000]  And then her claiming she didn't do it.
[02:22:17.000 --> 02:22:21.000]  I mean, I'm not saying she's on meth, but she looks like a meth addict to me.
[02:22:21.000 --> 02:22:23.000]  She looks like she has meth mouth.
[02:22:23.000 --> 02:22:26.000]  So does that professor she had on defending her own Tucker Carlson last Friday?
[02:22:26.000 --> 02:22:28.000]  I mean, are you changing your calculus now?
[02:22:28.000 --> 02:22:30.000]  Because it seems like you were right a few weeks ago,
[02:22:30.000 --> 02:22:32.000]  but they're going so far, it could backfire.
[02:22:32.000 --> 02:22:36.000]  Yeah, you know, as crazy as they are, it's ultimately not going to be about
[02:22:36.000 --> 02:22:40.000]  the climate change deniers, but the economy deniers.
[02:22:40.000 --> 02:22:42.000]  You know, look at the data out today.
[02:22:42.000 --> 02:22:45.000]  The biggest drop in retail sales in one month.
[02:22:45.000 --> 02:22:48.000]  This was December since 2009.
[02:22:48.000 --> 02:22:50.000]  We were in the great recession.
[02:22:50.000 --> 02:22:53.000]  The last time retail sales fell as much as they just plunged.
[02:22:53.000 --> 02:22:57.000]  Look at the numbers we got out yesterday on delinquencies in auto loans.
[02:22:57.000 --> 02:22:59.000]  It is an all-time record high.
[02:22:59.000 --> 02:23:03.000]  People who are 90 days or more behind in their car payments.
[02:23:03.000 --> 02:23:07.000]  I just read today that restaurant sales are falling now
[02:23:07.000 --> 02:23:11.000]  for four out of the last five months at the fastest pace
[02:23:11.000 --> 02:23:13.000]  in more than 25 years.
[02:23:13.000 --> 02:23:16.000]  That means restaurant sales now are weaker than they were
[02:23:16.000 --> 02:23:19.000]  in the 01 recession or the 08 recession.
[02:23:19.000 --> 02:23:21.000]  Now, of course, it'd be much better off.
[02:23:21.000 --> 02:23:24.000]  We'd all be better off if Cortez was still waiting tables
[02:23:24.000 --> 02:23:26.000]  instead of working in Congress.
[02:23:26.000 --> 02:23:29.000]  But these crazy policies that she's advocating,
[02:23:29.000 --> 02:23:33.000]  look, the public might just turn to them in 2020
[02:23:33.000 --> 02:23:36.000]  if we are in a bad recession
[02:23:36.000 --> 02:23:41.000]  and it's all blamed on the tax cuts, on Trump, on deregulation.
[02:23:41.000 --> 02:23:46.000]  And the only solution left for people to grasp for is socialism.
[02:23:46.000 --> 02:23:48.000]  And of course, you know, it's never worked.
[02:23:48.000 --> 02:23:50.000]  It's failed every time it's been tried,
[02:23:50.000 --> 02:23:53.000]  but that doesn't stop people from trying it again.
[02:23:53.000 --> 02:23:56.000]  Let me ask you this, then, and I saw those numbers
[02:23:56.000 --> 02:23:58.000]  and I agree that it's a bubble economy
[02:23:58.000 --> 02:24:00.000]  and what are we supposed to do?
[02:24:00.000 --> 02:24:02.000]  But there's also the numbers.
[02:24:02.000 --> 02:24:05.000]  People say that there are fiscally the most positive
[02:24:05.000 --> 02:24:09.000]  about their investments and the future and the economy.
[02:24:09.000 --> 02:24:11.000]  And so if you're going to be in a fiat system,
[02:24:11.000 --> 02:24:15.000]  it's good to have confidence because that's all you do have.
[02:24:15.000 --> 02:24:17.000]  And I know you're invested heavily in Europe and China,
[02:24:17.000 --> 02:24:18.000]  but I mean, at the same time,
[02:24:18.000 --> 02:24:21.000]  they're having some major financial problems as well.
[02:24:21.000 --> 02:24:23.000]  Not if the optimism is unfounded
[02:24:23.000 --> 02:24:25.000]  and people are going to turn around very quickly
[02:24:25.000 --> 02:24:29.000]  when they wake up to reality with the national debt just yesterday
[02:24:29.000 --> 02:24:32.000]  exceeded $22 trillion for the first time.
[02:24:32.000 --> 02:24:35.000]  We're going to break $23 trillion this year, too.
[02:24:35.000 --> 02:24:38.000]  And, you know, we're continuing to go deeper and deeper into debt.
[02:24:38.000 --> 02:24:40.000]  Sure, but you're a smart guy.
[02:24:40.000 --> 02:24:42.000]  And I'm as Mr. Fiskel conservative with you
[02:24:42.000 --> 02:24:44.000]  and Gold, Silver, all that.
[02:24:44.000 --> 02:24:47.000]  We've kind of like passed the point on a return now.
[02:24:47.000 --> 02:24:49.000]  We're, okay, adrenaline's keeping the body alive.
[02:24:49.000 --> 02:24:50.000]  Okay, let's keep it alive.
[02:24:50.000 --> 02:24:51.000]  I mean, we've kind of, there's,
[02:24:51.000 --> 02:24:53.000]  I don't think there's any put in hubby-dumby back together again.
[02:24:53.000 --> 02:24:55.000]  So I think it's like, where does the inflation go?
[02:24:55.000 --> 02:24:56.000]  Does it build some infrastructure?
[02:24:56.000 --> 02:24:59.000]  Does it build some factories? Does it give some confidence?
[02:24:59.000 --> 02:25:01.000]  I mean, I think we're so screwed now.
[02:25:01.000 --> 02:25:03.000]  The crash landing is just an inflation war.
[02:25:03.000 --> 02:25:04.000]  Yeah.
[02:25:04.000 --> 02:25:06.000]  Right. Well, inflation doesn't build anything.
[02:25:06.000 --> 02:25:07.000]  It destroys.
[02:25:07.000 --> 02:25:09.000]  All it does is destroy the value of money.
[02:25:09.000 --> 02:25:12.000]  It does in later stages if dictators run off and buy 100 Ferraris.
[02:25:12.000 --> 02:25:18.000]  But if you build infrastructure and attack bombers and cruise missiles, it does.
[02:25:18.000 --> 02:25:20.000]  No, it doesn't build.
[02:25:20.000 --> 02:25:24.000]  All that does is divert resources away from where they otherwise would have been deployed.
[02:25:24.000 --> 02:25:27.000]  You cannot make a country rich by printing money.
[02:25:27.000 --> 02:25:32.000]  You know, unfortunately, that's how Cortez ultimately is going to try to finance any
[02:25:32.000 --> 02:25:34.000]  type of green new deal that we get.
[02:25:34.000 --> 02:25:35.000]  No, you're right.
[02:25:35.000 --> 02:25:36.000]  She said, forget Debuses.
[02:25:36.000 --> 02:25:37.000]  We'll print out of it like Venezuela.
[02:25:37.000 --> 02:25:38.000]  You're right.
[02:25:38.000 --> 02:25:40.000]  I'm just saying we're already on that course.
[02:25:40.000 --> 02:25:41.000]  Let me ask Peter Schiff this way.
[02:25:41.000 --> 02:25:44.000]  You're a smart economist, a self-made guy.
[02:25:44.000 --> 02:25:46.000]  A lot of predictions come true like 9%.
[02:25:46.000 --> 02:25:51.000]  If we're going down the path anyways, is there any way to tailor the inflationary hellhole
[02:25:51.000 --> 02:25:52.000]  where it's better for the public?
[02:25:52.000 --> 02:25:56.000]  Like, if we're going to be executed a little bit of like a cocktail before we get killed
[02:25:56.000 --> 02:25:57.000]  or...
[02:25:57.000 --> 02:26:02.280]  Well, look, I do believe it's better to have a self-inflicted, you know, implosion than
[02:26:02.280 --> 02:26:05.920]  one that is brought about externally in a worse crisis.
[02:26:05.920 --> 02:26:10.120]  We should bite the bullet and level with the American public about what needs to be done
[02:26:10.120 --> 02:26:14.720]  to solve the problems that were created by big government and the Federal Reserve.
[02:26:14.720 --> 02:26:16.800]  But, you know, nobody wants to do that.
[02:26:16.800 --> 02:26:20.000]  Everybody wants to pretend it's great and keep kicking a can down the road.
[02:26:20.000 --> 02:26:24.500]  I just don't think Trump's going to be able to kick it down the road beyond the 2020 election.
[02:26:24.500 --> 02:26:28.160]  I think if you look at everything that's going on now, it's coming to a head.
[02:26:28.160 --> 02:26:33.600]  And I don't think he's going to get out of dodge, you know, the way Barack Obama did.
[02:26:33.600 --> 02:26:38.840]  But you know, the craziest thing about, you know, Akasha Cortez's Green New Deal and what
[02:26:38.840 --> 02:26:42.720]  she's saying, and of course, you know, everything about it is crazy.
[02:26:42.720 --> 02:26:45.720]  But is the belief that this is actually going to be good for the economy?
[02:26:45.720 --> 02:26:50.160]  I mean, if we actually had to do this, if we really face this threat, this is going
[02:26:50.160 --> 02:26:53.120]  to be mutual shared sacrifice.
[02:26:53.120 --> 02:26:56.520]  Everybody is going to suffer to implement this, particularly the poor and the middle
[02:26:56.520 --> 02:26:57.520]  class.
[02:26:57.520 --> 02:27:00.640]  They're going to feel the burden, the heaviest, but she is trying to, you know, wrap this
[02:27:00.640 --> 02:27:06.520]  thing up as if everybody is going to benefit from a huge reduction in our standard of living,
[02:27:06.520 --> 02:27:07.680]  which would be required.
[02:27:07.680 --> 02:27:12.520]  And of course, when our Cortez is always asked, of Cortez, how are you going to pay for this?
[02:27:12.520 --> 02:27:15.440]  Her answer is always, how do you pay for anything?
[02:27:15.440 --> 02:27:16.920]  How do we pay for World War II?
[02:27:16.920 --> 02:27:22.000]  Yeah, she's like a five-year-old, so let me ask you this, because we doubled our population
[02:27:22.000 --> 02:27:24.240]  and we won the war, you dumb idiot.
[02:27:24.240 --> 02:27:25.840]  That's a totally different ballgame right now.
[02:27:25.840 --> 02:27:26.840]  She just doesn't get it.
[02:27:26.840 --> 02:27:31.680]  No, but the point she doesn't get, Alex, is that the way we paid for those things is
[02:27:31.680 --> 02:27:35.840]  through massive tax increases on the middle class and the working poor.
[02:27:35.840 --> 02:27:41.560]  I mean, she doesn't know her history, but in 1929, just before the Great Depression,
[02:27:41.560 --> 02:27:47.040]  the lowest tax bracket for income earners was one and a half percent, and the highest
[02:27:47.040 --> 02:27:48.640]  bracket was 25 percent.
[02:27:48.640 --> 02:27:53.920]  Now, even though we increased the top bracket from 25 percent to 92, and then it went down
[02:27:53.920 --> 02:28:00.200]  to 91 in 1946 after we won the war, we increased the lowest bracket from one and a half to
[02:28:00.200 --> 02:28:06.280]  24 percent, and we only lowered it to 20 percent in 1946 after we won the war.
[02:28:06.280 --> 02:28:10.680]  And let's be clear, the rich people all had it right off written into it.
[02:28:10.680 --> 02:28:15.360]  Well, of course, they didn't really pay that top bracket, but the problem, the point is
[02:28:15.360 --> 02:28:20.960]  that the middle class got hit with massive tax hikes, much bigger than the tax hikes
[02:28:20.960 --> 02:28:22.160]  on the rich.
[02:28:22.160 --> 02:28:25.960]  And so that's how we paid for the New Deal and World War II.
[02:28:25.960 --> 02:28:33.560]  And so if AOC wants to pay for the Green New Deal the same way, then it has to be through
[02:28:33.560 --> 02:28:36.160]  huge tax increases on her constituents.
[02:28:36.160 --> 02:28:41.080]  Let's talk about what her Green Deal from your research would do, some are saying total
[02:28:41.080 --> 02:28:44.840]  class recitalization killed Spain, they tried to happen this, it killed them.
[02:28:44.840 --> 02:28:47.080]  They were above an economy until 10 years ago.
[02:28:47.080 --> 02:28:50.480]  Peter Schiff's our guest, I'm Alan Jones, UralPak.com's his website.
[02:28:50.480 --> 02:28:55.240]  I'm at newswars.com, stay well as we're right back.
[02:28:55.240 --> 02:28:57.760]  Know someone with a drinking or drug problem?
[02:28:57.760 --> 02:29:00.320]  Learn how to get sober after we share these stories.
[02:29:00.320 --> 02:29:04.520]  I was 35 with two beautiful children when my life and addiction started to spiral out
[02:29:04.520 --> 02:29:05.600]  of control.
[02:29:05.600 --> 02:29:10.960]  After my divorce, I went into a depression cycle and started drinking more often and
[02:29:10.960 --> 02:29:12.800]  using prescription drugs.
[02:29:12.800 --> 02:29:17.080]  After my second DWI and arrest, my ex-husband threatened to take our children away from
[02:29:17.080 --> 02:29:18.080]  me.
[02:29:18.080 --> 02:29:21.080]  I was 17 when I became addicted to heroin and meth.
[02:29:21.080 --> 02:29:24.600]  I thought I could quit on my own, but I couldn't.
[02:29:24.600 --> 02:29:27.320]  It hit me when I was arrested.
[02:29:27.320 --> 02:29:28.800]  Get sober now.
[02:29:28.800 --> 02:29:32.080]  Your private insurance may cover costs and we'll get you here.
[02:29:32.080 --> 02:29:33.080]  It's simple.

[02:29:49.640 --> 02:30:05.640]  Call right now before it's too late, 800-213-9264.
[02:30:05.640 --> 02:30:12.120]  By leaps and by bounds, the number one best selling supplement family in the world is
[02:30:12.120 --> 02:30:17.840]  energy drinks and energy supplements, but they are riddled with dyes and toxins and
[02:30:17.840 --> 02:30:22.320]  synthetic caffeine and other chemicals that sure get you a quick boost but burn out in
[02:30:22.320 --> 02:30:24.760]  just a few hours and have terrible side effects.
[02:30:24.760 --> 02:30:31.320]  We have developed, hands down from our research, the most powerful, healthy energy drink, pre-workout
[02:30:31.320 --> 02:30:34.200]  and beyond system in the world.
[02:30:34.200 --> 02:30:35.680]  There's nothing else like it.
[02:30:35.680 --> 02:30:36.680]  Must experience it.
[02:30:36.680 --> 02:30:41.640]  It is a total game changer and it comes in easy to use, packets to mix in with fruges
[02:30:41.640 --> 02:30:43.640]  or water, whatever you'd like.
[02:30:43.640 --> 02:30:45.140]  Warning though, it's very, very strong.
[02:30:45.140 --> 02:30:46.640]  It lasts 10 hours.
[02:30:46.640 --> 02:30:50.760]  So take a half packet the first time you take it because TurboForce is named TurboForce
[02:30:50.760 --> 02:30:53.280]  because it will take you into overdrive.
[02:30:53.280 --> 02:30:55.280]  TurboForce at m4slive.com.

[02:32:59.920 --> 02:33:19.600]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[02:33:19.600 --> 02:33:33.680]  Well, Peter Schiff's a smart cookie at EuroPak.com.
[02:33:33.680 --> 02:33:38.000]  I want to get his take on where he sees Trump's going and the economy and so much.
[02:33:38.000 --> 02:33:40.480]  You know, I see where Trump was.
[02:33:40.480 --> 02:33:44.400]  It's easy to sit back as an economist and smart guy and say by the bullet and I might
[02:33:44.400 --> 02:33:47.880]  have done that if I was the president but he thought he would wow the country over with
[02:33:47.880 --> 02:33:51.560]  some prosperity because all that had been given to the bankers for a while and not the
[02:33:51.560 --> 02:33:55.760]  people but I agree with Schiff.
[02:33:55.760 --> 02:34:02.280]  This whole course is a collision course with disaster and, you know, but you talk up America
[02:34:02.280 --> 02:34:06.600]  and you say you love the country versus Cuomo saying America was never great, you'll never
[02:34:06.600 --> 02:34:07.600]  be that great.
[02:34:07.600 --> 02:34:14.280]  You can't help but love the guy but, okay, Pelosi wanted zero.
[02:34:14.280 --> 02:34:15.760]  He got 1.3 billion.
[02:34:15.760 --> 02:34:21.400]  He could have declared the emergency and built the whole wall.
[02:34:21.400 --> 02:34:22.720]  He's going along with DACA.
[02:34:22.720 --> 02:34:29.600]  Now, in fairness, he said he'd go along with partial DACA but then he's trying to get us
[02:34:29.600 --> 02:34:32.160]  out of Afghanistan and Syria.
[02:34:32.160 --> 02:34:33.160]  That's beautiful.
[02:34:33.160 --> 02:34:34.560]  So, I mean, I love Trump.
[02:34:34.560 --> 02:34:36.160]  I've been destroyed for it.
[02:34:36.160 --> 02:34:37.160]  I've been attacked.
[02:34:37.160 --> 02:34:38.160]  I've been demonized.
[02:34:38.160 --> 02:34:39.160]  We're going back to Peter Schiff in a moment.
[02:34:39.160 --> 02:34:42.960]  It's just that it is a quandary.
[02:34:42.960 --> 02:34:50.040]  When Peter Schiff's right, the economy is having some problems and when people figure
[02:34:50.040 --> 02:34:58.640]  out that it's not all roses, they're going to turn on him like milk out of his expiration
[02:34:58.640 --> 02:35:05.800]  date and the answer then they've got it all primed is men and women fighting with each
[02:35:05.800 --> 02:35:11.400]  other, racial divide, class envy, God and then all the rich billionaires like he was
[02:35:11.400 --> 02:35:14.760]  saying before the break, like that 90% tax show was here about.
[02:35:14.760 --> 02:35:16.240]  They had family trust.
[02:35:16.240 --> 02:35:17.240]  They had deals.
[02:35:17.240 --> 02:35:18.240]  They had offshore.
[02:35:18.240 --> 02:35:19.840]  He's like, oh, Trump's a criminal.
[02:35:19.840 --> 02:35:22.960]  His dad gave all his wealth away when the kids were babies.
[02:35:22.960 --> 02:35:23.960]  That's what anybody does.
[02:35:23.960 --> 02:35:27.120]  It's how you get out of the taxes.
[02:35:27.120 --> 02:35:30.880]  So why are all these rich kids, trust fund kids, because that's how the government don't
[02:35:30.880 --> 02:35:32.560]  get the money.
[02:35:32.560 --> 02:35:34.120]  They don't pay the taxes.
[02:35:34.120 --> 02:35:35.120]  No gates.
[02:35:35.120 --> 02:35:36.120]  All should pay hard taxes.
[02:35:36.120 --> 02:35:37.120]  The guy pays basically zero.
[02:35:37.120 --> 02:35:38.120]  He has a tax-free foundation.
[02:35:38.120 --> 02:35:40.120]  We'll go back to Peter Schiff in a moment.
[02:35:40.120 --> 02:35:45.960]  At EuroPact.com, just briefly, my philosophy is this.
[02:35:45.960 --> 02:35:48.320]  Bring you the best products, the lowest prices.
[02:35:48.320 --> 02:35:49.880]  You'll get a great response.
[02:35:49.880 --> 02:35:54.200]  You'll love it, the supplements.
[02:35:54.200 --> 02:36:00.880]  But they're demonizing me selling high-quality fish oil, highest-end fish oil, private label
[02:36:00.880 --> 02:36:01.880]  buyage.
[02:36:01.880 --> 02:36:04.800]  They have the price of the very same stuff sold at medical facilities.
[02:36:04.800 --> 02:36:08.360]  There's a lot of medical places now that have a whole vitamin aisle.
[02:36:08.360 --> 02:36:12.240]  Your doctor tells you, well, $100 of the fish oil is at a $30 from us.
[02:36:12.240 --> 02:36:13.240]  Same fish oil.
[02:36:13.240 --> 02:36:16.600]  Highest quality, best you can get.
[02:36:16.600 --> 02:36:17.600]  Protein bars.
[02:36:17.600 --> 02:36:18.840]  Mill replacement.
[02:36:18.840 --> 02:36:22.640]  This is a $6 to $7 bar, but they mark them up four, five, six, seven times.
[02:36:22.640 --> 02:36:23.640]  We only mark it up 150%.
[02:36:23.640 --> 02:36:29.000]  We lower it with a discount to 100% markup.
[02:36:29.000 --> 02:36:31.680]  That means the bar costs us like $1.5.
[02:36:31.680 --> 02:36:33.840]  We're selling to you for $3.
[02:36:33.840 --> 02:36:37.000]  But discounted, introductory, it's $2.40.
[02:36:37.000 --> 02:36:40.080]  12 bars, incredibly tasty.
[02:36:40.080 --> 02:36:41.480]  This is vanilla coconut, my favorite.
[02:36:41.480 --> 02:36:44.840]  And we have the chocolate, peanut butter as well.
[02:36:44.840 --> 02:36:45.840]  And it's our new product.
[02:36:45.840 --> 02:36:49.400]  And if you'll just get our fluoride-free toothpaste and son-of-a-frotto-ship additional
[02:36:49.400 --> 02:36:53.920]  2% off, if you'll just get our Wake Up America coffee for the mountains of southern Mexico
[02:36:53.920 --> 02:36:56.080]  Chiapas, I think it's the best out there.
[02:36:56.080 --> 02:36:57.080]  People love it.
[02:36:57.080 --> 02:37:02.160]  It's got, look at that, 98% reviews, 794 reviews by Power Reviews, 4.9.
[02:37:02.160 --> 02:37:03.160]  Nobody's got that.
[02:37:03.160 --> 02:37:04.160]  It's the best coffee.
[02:37:04.160 --> 02:37:05.160]  It was already the highest rated.
[02:37:05.160 --> 02:37:07.040]  What's the highest rated coffee at Whole Foods?
[02:37:07.040 --> 02:37:08.520]  It was like 10 years ago.
[02:37:08.520 --> 02:37:11.120]  It's High Mountain Chiapas grown, Wild Crafted.
[02:37:11.120 --> 02:37:12.320]  It's not even organic.
[02:37:12.320 --> 02:37:13.320]  It's beyond that.
[02:37:13.320 --> 02:37:14.320]  It's picked by the locals.
[02:37:14.320 --> 02:37:16.040]  And it's the highest rated Whole Foods.
[02:37:16.040 --> 02:37:17.040]  It's the best seller too.
[02:37:17.040 --> 02:37:20.040]  I said, get me the distributor.
[02:37:20.040 --> 02:37:21.720]  Got them, made a deal.
[02:37:21.720 --> 02:37:22.720]  They were leftist.
[02:37:22.720 --> 02:37:23.720]  They got pissed.
[02:37:23.720 --> 02:37:24.720]  Try to change it.
[02:37:24.720 --> 02:37:25.720]  I went right to the Rebels and got it.
[02:37:25.720 --> 02:37:31.880]  The point is, is that it's $10 less a pound than what they sell at Whole Foods, m4store.com.
[02:37:31.880 --> 02:37:32.880]  Just get your coffee.
[02:37:32.880 --> 02:37:33.880]  Get your toothpaste.
[02:37:33.880 --> 02:37:38.400]  Get your protein bars from us, sign up for auto-ship, and just forget it.
[02:37:38.400 --> 02:37:39.400]  You got it handled.
[02:37:39.400 --> 02:37:41.800]  And I'll be out there like an attack dog going after him.
[02:37:41.800 --> 02:37:44.360]  If you don't, Soros is going to shut us down.
[02:37:44.360 --> 02:37:47.040]  m4store.com, take advantage of the products today.
[02:37:47.040 --> 02:37:50.320]  Peter Schiff, you heard all my questions, babblinguropec.com.
[02:37:50.320 --> 02:37:53.400]  Nobody needs to have you introduced to them.
[02:37:53.400 --> 02:37:55.480]  You were getting into where you see the economy going.
[02:37:55.480 --> 02:37:56.480]  What's going to happen?
[02:37:56.480 --> 02:37:57.680]  Trump, all of it.
[02:37:57.680 --> 02:37:58.680]  Yeah.
[02:37:58.680 --> 02:38:02.200]  Well, you know, Alex, you know, if Trump really wanted to make American great again,
[02:38:02.200 --> 02:38:05.560]  the only way to do that is to make government small again.
[02:38:05.560 --> 02:38:09.200]  But the problem is, you know, he hasn't been building a wall, but Trump's been building
[02:38:09.200 --> 02:38:10.200]  up government.
[02:38:10.200 --> 02:38:11.520]  He's made government bigger.
[02:38:11.520 --> 02:38:16.360]  He's been building bigger national debt, you know, bigger deficits.
[02:38:16.360 --> 02:38:20.560]  So building up debt and building up government is not the secret to making America great.
[02:38:20.560 --> 02:38:22.600]  We need to be tearing this stuff down.
[02:38:22.600 --> 02:38:24.520]  But Trump has blown that opportunity.
[02:38:24.520 --> 02:38:29.640]  He had two years with the Republican Congress to try to make a difference and to shrink
[02:38:29.640 --> 02:38:34.640]  the size of government to tackle the problems with entitlements, yet he did none of that.
[02:38:34.640 --> 02:38:38.080]  All he did was offer a tax cut paid for with bigger deficits.
[02:38:38.080 --> 02:38:40.040]  Well, he did blow the trifecta.
[02:38:40.040 --> 02:38:41.640]  He did blow the trifecta.
[02:38:41.640 --> 02:38:42.640]  Yeah.
[02:38:42.640 --> 02:38:48.640]  And so now the stuff's going to blow up and America, as I said, is going to turn to another
[02:38:48.640 --> 02:38:55.200]  false promise of socialism, of this, you know, utopia that awaits us if we simply turn over
[02:38:55.200 --> 02:38:59.040]  everything to the government, that the government is going to manage the economy and they're
[02:38:59.040 --> 02:39:05.000]  going to take over the distribution of wealth and resources and production, and everybody's
[02:39:05.000 --> 02:39:06.000]  going to prosper.
[02:39:06.000 --> 02:39:07.480]  We're going to have all this great prosperity.
[02:39:07.480 --> 02:39:08.480]  That's Venezuela.
[02:39:08.480 --> 02:39:09.480]  How the hell...
[02:39:09.480 --> 02:39:10.480]  Yes, exactly.
[02:39:10.480 --> 02:39:13.760]  Do we have half the millennials saying they want communism?
[02:39:13.760 --> 02:39:18.000]  Because they were educated or indoctrinated in American schools, you know, the average
[02:39:18.000 --> 02:39:21.280]  schoolteachers, the socialists, they don't know what they're talking about.
[02:39:21.280 --> 02:39:27.480]  I mean, we borrow and spend, you know, so much money, trillions of dollars to basically
[02:39:27.480 --> 02:39:28.920]  brainwash our kids.
[02:39:28.920 --> 02:39:34.640]  We've got student debt now, 1.6 trillion dollars.
[02:39:34.640 --> 02:39:36.280]  What do we have to show for that?
[02:39:36.280 --> 02:39:41.320]  A bunch of socialists, a bunch of people who are waiting to vote for the same type of economic
[02:39:41.320 --> 02:39:44.420]  system that has destroyed Venezuela.
[02:39:44.420 --> 02:39:45.480]  People are starving.
[02:39:45.480 --> 02:39:47.480]  People are dying literally in the streets.
[02:39:47.480 --> 02:39:48.480]  It's a menace suicide.
[02:39:48.480 --> 02:39:50.800]  So what do you predict next?
[02:39:50.800 --> 02:39:51.800]  Because Cortez is...
[02:39:51.800 --> 02:39:55.560]  I saw on our website that day, it was up for 12 hours, 13 hours, and she says, oh, I never
[02:39:55.560 --> 02:39:56.560]  did that.
[02:39:56.560 --> 02:40:03.120]  And she said, if you can't work or don't want to work, I mean, look, I'd be like, democracy
[02:40:03.120 --> 02:40:05.720]  is a very dangerous form of government.
[02:40:05.720 --> 02:40:09.160]  I've been saying that for a long time, and this is the proof.
[02:40:09.160 --> 02:40:14.360]  When you elect people like this, this shows you how dangerous democracy is and how smart
[02:40:14.360 --> 02:40:17.200]  our founders were who wrote the Constitution.
[02:40:17.200 --> 02:40:18.920]  They tried to protect us from the time...
[02:40:18.920 --> 02:40:19.920]  Explain that, people.
[02:40:19.920 --> 02:40:22.760]  A republic is actually the cure to democracy.
[02:40:22.760 --> 02:40:23.760]  Yes.
[02:40:23.760 --> 02:40:25.120]  We have a Republican government.
[02:40:25.120 --> 02:40:26.560]  We need the Constitution.
[02:40:26.560 --> 02:40:30.800]  It guarantees to every state in the union a Republican form of government.
[02:40:30.800 --> 02:40:34.880]  There is no mention of the word democracy in the Constitution, in the Bill of Rights,
[02:40:34.880 --> 02:40:36.720]  in the Declaration of Independence.
[02:40:36.720 --> 02:40:38.840]  America was not founded to be a democracy.
[02:40:38.840 --> 02:40:45.640]  We were founded as a republic to protect Americans from the tyranny of democracy, because democracy,
[02:40:45.640 --> 02:40:51.600]  like socialism, has failed every time it's been tried because the people vote in socialism.
[02:40:51.600 --> 02:40:54.800]  And when you talk about democratic socialism, that's what it is.
[02:40:54.800 --> 02:40:57.560]  It's socialism where the people vote for it.
[02:40:57.560 --> 02:41:00.560]  And just because the people vote for something bad doesn't mean you can't vote.
[02:41:00.560 --> 02:41:04.480]  Yeah, just because they vote to play Russian roulette, well, it's not even Russian roulette.
[02:41:04.480 --> 02:41:06.120]  You're guaranteed to fail.
[02:41:06.120 --> 02:41:10.120]  How fast does the average socialist state fail, like 15 years?
[02:41:10.120 --> 02:41:14.040]  I don't know what the exact number is, but the only ones that even could look like they've
[02:41:14.040 --> 02:41:18.400]  succeeded is where they have a strong economy to destroy.
[02:41:18.400 --> 02:41:19.400]  So if you...
[02:41:19.400 --> 02:41:24.040]  If socialists come to power when you have prosperity that was created by capitalism,
[02:41:24.040 --> 02:41:26.440]  it takes longer to squander the wealth.
[02:41:26.440 --> 02:41:27.440]  But if socialism...
[02:41:27.440 --> 02:41:28.440]  Exactly.
[02:41:28.440 --> 02:41:34.320]  Big, rich, fat, rich Europe or the U.S. or Canada can go 30, 40 years, but when it crashes,
[02:41:34.320 --> 02:41:35.320]  it's even worse.
[02:41:35.320 --> 02:41:36.320]  Yeah.
[02:41:36.320 --> 02:41:39.960]  And so the problem is, though, we're going to embark on socialism in America when we're
[02:41:39.960 --> 02:41:40.960]  already broke.
[02:41:40.960 --> 02:41:45.000]  That's the problem, because we've already had a lot of socialism mixed in with capitalism.
[02:41:45.000 --> 02:41:49.560]  We've had this mixed economy, and capitalism gets the blame for the problems created by
[02:41:49.560 --> 02:41:51.920]  socialism, but we're deeply in debt.
[02:41:51.920 --> 02:41:54.120]  We have a completely screwed up economy.
[02:41:54.120 --> 02:42:00.360]  It completely depends on our ability to export dollars and import everything else, but people
[02:42:00.360 --> 02:42:04.960]  are not going to want the world's reserve currency to be a currency issued by a socialist
[02:42:04.960 --> 02:42:05.960]  country.
[02:42:05.960 --> 02:42:10.400]  When we start going down the Green New Deal and running massive deficits to try to create
[02:42:10.400 --> 02:42:13.760]  this liberal utopia, the dollar is going to collapse.
[02:42:13.760 --> 02:42:17.120]  I mean, we're not going to be able to buy anything, so we're going to be having the
[02:42:17.120 --> 02:42:20.000]  same type of inflation that they're experiencing down there.
[02:42:20.000 --> 02:42:24.240]  And I asked the question earlier, and I forgot during the break, what does Mike Adams had
[02:42:24.240 --> 02:42:26.240]  a big video on this and a bunch of experts looked at it?
[02:42:26.240 --> 02:42:30.640]  If we did her deal, if they tried to tear down all the buildings that aren't whatever
[02:42:30.640 --> 02:42:35.400]  and got rid of the airplanes, I mean, you listen to this, it's like just cuckoo level.
[02:42:35.400 --> 02:42:39.000]  And like Trump said, only we do it, no one else does.
[02:42:39.000 --> 02:42:40.000]  What is the thinking there?
[02:42:40.000 --> 02:42:41.000]  How are we going to do it?
[02:42:41.000 --> 02:42:42.240]  Where are we going to get the resources?
[02:42:42.240 --> 02:42:43.800]  Where are we going to get the manpower?
[02:42:43.800 --> 02:42:46.640]  I mean, everybody's going to have to work 24 hours a day.
[02:42:46.640 --> 02:42:48.800]  But she said nobody has to work.
[02:42:48.800 --> 02:42:50.800]  The kids are going to have to drop out of school.
[02:42:50.800 --> 02:42:51.800]  Everyone's going to have to work.
[02:42:51.800 --> 02:42:52.800]  We'll stay there.
[02:42:52.800 --> 02:42:53.800]  Tell us what's going to happen.
[02:42:53.800 --> 02:42:54.800]  We'll come back.

[02:43:55.400 --> 02:43:59.480]  You know, the worst part about getting old, and I'm still strong at 45, is that I won't
[02:43:59.480 --> 02:44:00.720]  be there for my children someday.
[02:44:00.720 --> 02:44:02.600]  That's why I need to make them strong now.
[02:44:02.600 --> 02:44:04.360]  Now I can be there for my children.
[02:44:04.360 --> 02:44:06.200]  Now I can make them strong.
[02:44:06.200 --> 02:44:07.840]  Now I can instruct them.
[02:44:07.840 --> 02:44:10.480]  Now I can teach them what I've learned, but not once I'm gone.
[02:44:10.480 --> 02:44:13.360]  You think of this digital age, your word's going forever, but now there isn't better
[02:44:13.360 --> 02:44:15.800]  than getting rid of what you said and they were before.
[02:44:15.800 --> 02:44:20.520]  It's so much easier to burn video or text or languages now that we have high-tech book
[02:44:20.520 --> 02:44:21.520]  burning, isn't it?
[02:44:21.520 --> 02:44:24.920]  But I have joined my will to the resistance.
[02:44:24.920 --> 02:44:29.200]  I can't be destroyed now, as long as I realize I've done right, and as long as the people
[02:44:29.200 --> 02:44:31.400]  know the truth, and you can't be destroyed either.
[02:44:31.400 --> 02:44:36.360]  As long as you bind yourself to something and commit to it, and go through the fire
[02:44:36.360 --> 02:44:40.720]  for it, there is a magic that then takes place, that transcends space and time.
[02:44:40.720 --> 02:44:45.240]  When you commit the word of mouth, or to pray for us, or to spread our articles and videos,

[02:46:18.200 --> 02:46:23.120]  We also have another product also produced by the same company, Immune Gargle.
[02:46:23.120 --> 02:46:27.360]  We've been selling a lot of the wound gel and a lot of the immune gargle.

[02:46:49.520 --> 02:46:54.880]  It's super blue, silver immune gargle, and super silver wound dressing for 40% off at
[02:46:54.880 --> 02:46:59.440]  InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:46:59.440 --> 02:47:18.600]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[02:47:18.600 --> 02:47:22.920]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com frontline report.
[02:47:22.920 --> 02:47:36.120]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:47:36.120 --> 02:47:45.400]  Joe Rogan, my old friend, came out and said that black people are apes and that their
[02:47:45.400 --> 02:47:49.600]  neighborhoods are planet apes.
[02:47:49.600 --> 02:47:55.200]  And I was like, wait a minute, I remember running to Joe with his little black daughter
[02:47:55.200 --> 02:48:02.960]  and then I talked about it and people said, oh, Joe Rogan doesn't have a black daughter.
[02:48:02.960 --> 02:48:06.080]  And I searched it and he does and she looks like a supermodel.
[02:48:06.080 --> 02:48:10.920]  So I don't think Joe's being racist there, but here's the deal.
[02:48:10.920 --> 02:48:18.000]  If I, these guys just killed the doors, let's bring that back up again.
[02:48:18.000 --> 02:48:20.200]  I just hit a button.
[02:48:20.200 --> 02:48:24.600]  Anyways, I'm going to next hour, format bracket takes over.
[02:48:24.600 --> 02:48:30.560]  Just illustrate, he's at Google, Facebook, Twitter, darling.
[02:48:30.560 --> 02:48:36.160]  If I said black people were apes, which I don't think because we can, we're humans,
[02:48:36.160 --> 02:48:38.160]  I can bring with black people, they can bring with me.
[02:48:38.160 --> 02:48:41.200]  I'm not, I mean, we are in the Simeon class.
[02:48:41.200 --> 02:48:42.200]  We're kind of cool.
[02:48:42.200 --> 02:48:43.680]  We build spaceships and stuff.
[02:48:43.680 --> 02:48:48.680]  The point is, is that that's the big no-no, you know, Jimmy the Greek 40, 50 years ago
[02:48:48.680 --> 02:48:50.240]  said black people, something like that.
[02:48:50.240 --> 02:48:51.240]  He got fired.
[02:48:51.240 --> 02:48:52.800]  So why can Joe Rogan do it?
[02:48:52.800 --> 02:48:56.080]  I don't think Joe Rogan is a racist.
[02:48:56.080 --> 02:48:59.640]  I want the governor of Virginia gone because he said kill babies after they're born, not
[02:48:59.640 --> 02:49:02.280]  because he dressed up in blackface, which I wouldn't do.
[02:49:02.280 --> 02:49:04.520]  I think it's offensive.
[02:49:04.520 --> 02:49:05.520]  People do it for comedy.
[02:49:05.520 --> 02:49:06.520]  I'm not judging them.
[02:49:06.520 --> 02:49:12.920]  I just, I don't do stuff that like puts people down as a class, but I think somebody's
[02:49:12.920 --> 02:49:19.040]  a bad person than I come after them because there are bad Chinese and there are bad Jews
[02:49:19.040 --> 02:49:24.120]  and there are bad Arabs and there are bad Brits and there are bad Mexicans.
[02:49:24.120 --> 02:49:25.840]  But man, it's like fishing the sea.
[02:49:25.840 --> 02:49:26.840]  It's like a totally different deal.
[02:49:26.840 --> 02:49:27.840]  But I'm digressing.
[02:49:27.840 --> 02:49:30.480]  I want to finish up with Peter Schiff on the big news.
[02:49:30.480 --> 02:49:35.760]  The economy here, EuroPak.com, billions under management globally, been in pretty accurate
[02:49:35.760 --> 02:49:36.760]  with this crystal ball.
[02:49:36.760 --> 02:49:40.240]  I've been asking the questions here and I want to just ask that last one.
[02:49:40.240 --> 02:49:42.360]  They'll give you the floor the last seven, eight minutes here.
[02:49:42.360 --> 02:49:52.160]  You were joining us, but how do you see this unfolding if Alexandria Cortez, AOC got her
[02:49:52.160 --> 02:49:55.840]  way because, you know, they're going to force this vote in the house to prove how crazy
[02:49:55.840 --> 02:49:56.840]  it is.
[02:49:56.840 --> 02:49:57.840]  But some say it might pass.
[02:49:57.840 --> 02:50:00.520]  I mean, this is pretty much mainline.
[02:50:00.520 --> 02:50:03.440]  The Democratic Party is becoming, this is its mainline is what I'm saying.
[02:50:03.440 --> 02:50:04.440]  Yeah.
[02:50:04.440 --> 02:50:06.240]  I don't think it's going to go to a vote in the house.
[02:50:06.240 --> 02:50:12.360]  I don't think Nancy Pelosi is dumb enough to force Democrats to vote on this nonsense
[02:50:12.360 --> 02:50:13.360]  and take a side.
[02:50:13.360 --> 02:50:14.360]  The Senate's calling for that.
[02:50:14.360 --> 02:50:15.360]  Yeah.
[02:50:15.360 --> 02:50:19.080]  Well, because that makes sense because the Senate is going to put a lot of Democrats in
[02:50:19.080 --> 02:50:20.080]  a very bad position.
[02:50:20.080 --> 02:50:23.360]  I mean, all the Republicans are going to vote against it proudly.
[02:50:23.360 --> 02:50:26.720]  But you have these Democrats that are afraid to go against it.
[02:50:26.720 --> 02:50:32.760]  I mean, look, when Ocasio-Cortez had her press conference announcing this nonsense, she was
[02:50:32.760 --> 02:50:36.440]  surrounded by older white men, right?
[02:50:36.440 --> 02:50:39.960]  I mean, all these white guys, why were they there?
[02:50:39.960 --> 02:50:44.640]  Because they're trying to show up their support for the minorities, the base of the left wing,
[02:50:44.640 --> 02:50:47.360]  the, you know, the people that support Cortez in this nonsense.
[02:50:47.360 --> 02:50:50.480]  So they're, they're lining up behind her because they're afraid.
[02:50:50.480 --> 02:50:51.480]  No, you're right.
[02:50:51.480 --> 02:50:53.920]  The Democrats are 100% racial now.
[02:50:53.920 --> 02:50:56.160]  It's all based on race.
[02:50:56.160 --> 02:51:01.640]  And so these guys, you know, they're afraid to not support this, but a lot of these guys
[02:51:01.640 --> 02:51:05.000]  could be in districts where there are some people who are kind of in the center, some
[02:51:05.000 --> 02:51:07.600]  people who are independent.
[02:51:07.600 --> 02:51:12.080]  And you know, so they're going to lose in the general election, you know, absent the
[02:51:12.080 --> 02:51:16.240]  complete collapse of the economy, which I think might happen if they support this.
[02:51:16.240 --> 02:51:18.200]  So they're damned that they do and they're damned that they don't.
[02:51:18.200 --> 02:51:22.800]  They kill themselves in the primaries if they, if they don't support it, but then they could
[02:51:22.800 --> 02:51:24.800]  blow the general if they do.
[02:51:24.800 --> 02:51:29.160]  So I think it's smart politically for the Republicans to bring this nonsense to a vote.
[02:51:29.160 --> 02:51:30.760]  But I don't even know what they're voting for.
[02:51:30.760 --> 02:51:34.120]  There isn't actual, any real policy implications here.
[02:51:34.120 --> 02:51:37.480]  It's just these grandiose statements, but it shows the cancer.
[02:51:37.480 --> 02:51:38.480]  It's the grandiose-ness.
[02:51:38.480 --> 02:51:39.480]  Yeah.
[02:51:39.480 --> 02:51:45.840]  And even if you think about what they're saying, we're going to rebuild every structure
[02:51:45.840 --> 02:51:50.960]  in the United States in the next decade, every structure, think about how many structures
[02:51:50.960 --> 02:51:51.960]  exist in this country.
[02:51:51.960 --> 02:51:54.760]  It took 200 years to build those damn things.
[02:51:54.760 --> 02:51:55.760]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:51:55.760 --> 02:51:57.680]  And we're going to rebuild them in 10 years.
[02:51:57.680 --> 02:52:00.920]  But is every single person in America going to work construction?
[02:52:00.920 --> 02:52:04.400]  I mean, by the way, we had to do it to defeat space aliens.
[02:52:04.400 --> 02:52:05.400]  We could.
[02:52:05.400 --> 02:52:09.000]  The left puts all these regulations on where it's impossible to build.
[02:52:09.000 --> 02:52:12.440]  Oh, well, well, first of all, with all the environmental permits we would need, they'll
[02:52:12.440 --> 02:52:15.400]  take 10 years just to get the permits to redo all these buildings.
[02:52:15.400 --> 02:52:16.960]  I don't know how to actually do it.
[02:52:16.960 --> 02:52:24.480]  I mean, people are going to sue and then she's wearing $5,000 outfits and $2,000 shoes.
[02:52:24.480 --> 02:52:26.280]  And then we have to make them all ADA compliant.
[02:52:26.280 --> 02:52:30.080]  You know, if we're going to rebuild them all now, they all have to be, you know, accessible
[02:52:30.080 --> 02:52:32.400]  to people in wheelchairs and people who are blind.
[02:52:32.400 --> 02:52:35.160]  I mean, I mean, this is all a bunch of nonsense.
[02:52:35.160 --> 02:52:40.800]  The only person who can who can propose something like this is a waitress, right?
[02:52:40.800 --> 02:52:43.600]  A bartender, somebody who actually knows nothing.
[02:52:43.600 --> 02:52:44.600]  That's what we've done.
[02:52:44.600 --> 02:52:45.600]  Yeah.
[02:52:45.600 --> 02:52:49.760]  It'd be like her saying, I'm a waitress, I'm opening a bar with free drinks and food
[02:52:49.760 --> 02:52:50.760]  every night.
[02:52:50.760 --> 02:52:52.160]  You go bankrupt in one week.
[02:52:52.160 --> 02:52:53.160]  Well, that's it.
[02:52:53.160 --> 02:52:54.960]  Well, look, that's what happened with Penelope bread.
[02:52:54.960 --> 02:52:58.920]  They finally closed their last restaurant today where it was like, you know, pay what
[02:52:58.920 --> 02:52:59.920]  you want.
[02:52:59.920 --> 02:53:00.920]  You know, if you want to pay, pay.
[02:53:00.920 --> 02:53:01.920]  If not, don't pay.
[02:53:01.920 --> 02:53:02.920]  Of course, nobody paid.
[02:53:02.920 --> 02:53:06.120]  And so they ran out of money and now they, now they're shutting down their business.
[02:53:06.120 --> 02:53:08.840]  Who comes up with these plans?
[02:53:08.840 --> 02:53:13.760]  Look, I would love to open up something like a green cafe, you know, just as a test case
[02:53:13.760 --> 02:53:18.080]  where I said, Hey, here's a green cafe and we're going to pay people enough money so
[02:53:18.080 --> 02:53:22.760]  that even our, our dishwashers, you know, and our bus boys can support a family.
[02:53:22.760 --> 02:53:26.560]  We're going to give them vacations and pensions and great healthcare.
[02:53:26.560 --> 02:53:31.800]  And we're not going to use any electricity that isn't generated by solar or wind.
[02:53:31.800 --> 02:53:36.240]  And you know, so, but we're going to have to charge like $75 for a hamburger, uh, in
[02:53:36.240 --> 02:53:37.560]  order to make it all possible.
[02:53:37.560 --> 02:53:43.200]  I wonder how many liberals would come to my cafe and buy my expensive food to make all
[02:53:43.200 --> 02:53:47.000]  this fantasy a reality because they never want to put their money where their mouths
[02:53:47.000 --> 02:53:48.600]  are when it comes to this stuff.
[02:53:48.600 --> 02:53:49.600]  So they are.
[02:53:49.600 --> 02:53:54.480]  So they are the party of fantasy lands, let me ask you this.
[02:53:54.480 --> 02:54:02.920]  You've got to see Howard Schultz of, of the coffee company Starbucks and he's running
[02:54:02.920 --> 02:54:07.200]  around saying, Oh, you know, the Democrats are too extreme, but I think he's actually
[02:54:07.200 --> 02:54:09.880]  posing as conservative to siphon votes from Trump.
[02:54:09.880 --> 02:54:10.880]  What do you think?
[02:54:10.880 --> 02:54:15.680]  Well, I mean, he'd have to run as an independent and if he does run it as an independent, uh,
[02:54:15.680 --> 02:54:17.120]  you know, he may help Trump.
[02:54:17.120 --> 02:54:18.120]  I don't know.
[02:54:18.120 --> 02:54:23.160]  He might be, uh, something, you know, just like Ross pro, uh, helped out a Bill Clinton.
[02:54:23.160 --> 02:54:24.760]  I mean, he might actually help out Trump.
[02:54:24.760 --> 02:54:25.760]  Sure.
[02:54:25.760 --> 02:54:28.240]  But I'm asking you, what do you think is your smart guys behind Schultz?
[02:54:28.240 --> 02:54:29.240]  What do you think he's doing?
[02:54:29.240 --> 02:54:33.160]  Oh, I have no idea, you know, whether he's just trying to get some publicity or if he
[02:54:33.160 --> 02:54:36.440]  really thinks he's going to run for president, you know, if he's going to run, I don't know
[02:54:36.440 --> 02:54:40.920]  why he doesn't just run in the Democratic party as a centrist Democrat.
[02:54:40.920 --> 02:54:41.920]  Exactly.
[02:54:41.920 --> 02:54:44.160]  He could win there as a centrist Democrat.
[02:54:44.160 --> 02:54:49.240]  Well, I mean, if all the socialists split up the, the crazy vote, right, then he might
[02:54:49.240 --> 02:54:54.160]  be able to get enough of the, you know, slightly less crazy vote in order to get the nomination.
[02:54:54.160 --> 02:54:57.920]  And you know, as if he took the Democratic nomination, I mean, he would beat Trump.
[02:54:57.920 --> 02:55:01.360]  I mean, I think for sure he would beat him, especially since I think we're going to be
[02:55:01.360 --> 02:55:02.360]  in a recession.
[02:55:02.360 --> 02:55:08.960]  But I think the only Trump chance Trump has of, of winning in a recession is if the Democrats
[02:55:08.960 --> 02:55:15.040]  are so far into crazyville that enough people in some of these swing states, you know, just
[02:55:15.040 --> 02:55:16.040]  don't want to go that way.
[02:55:16.040 --> 02:55:17.040]  I mean, if there's still enough.
[02:55:17.040 --> 02:55:22.040]  Well, yeah, what do you make of this, uh, member of Congress that, that literally like
[02:55:22.040 --> 02:55:25.920]  sounds like David Duke crossed with Adolf Hitler?
[02:55:25.920 --> 02:55:31.480]  Look, well, this is all, this, this is all part of this, this, this cultural political
[02:55:31.480 --> 02:55:35.880]  correctness, you know, as long as you're some type of minority, as long as you fit into
[02:55:35.880 --> 02:55:41.120]  this victim class, you can say or do whatever you want with impunity and everything goes.
[02:55:41.120 --> 02:55:45.560]  Uh, you know, but if you're not, then, you know, it, that there's zero tolerance for
[02:55:45.560 --> 02:55:49.920]  you and it's not really about, uh, you know, substance anymore.
[02:55:49.920 --> 02:55:54.640]  It's all about the form and, and, and that is that the trap that we've fallen into.
[02:55:54.640 --> 02:55:58.800]  Unfortunately, there is no substance whatsoever to socialism, you know, it's all a bunch
[02:55:58.800 --> 02:55:59.800]  of rhetoric.
[02:55:59.800 --> 02:56:01.320]  It appeals to people's envy.
[02:56:01.320 --> 02:56:02.920]  It appeals to their greed.
[02:56:02.920 --> 02:56:07.080]  It appeals to the lowest common denominator of, Hey, let's steal money from other people
[02:56:07.080 --> 02:56:08.480]  so that we can have it.
[02:56:08.480 --> 02:56:11.840]  And somehow the other people who earn the money, uh, you know, they're not paying their
[02:56:11.840 --> 02:56:12.840]  fair share.
[02:56:12.840 --> 02:56:13.840]  Right.
[02:56:13.840 --> 02:56:16.640]  They somehow they, they got their wealth, uh, by stealing it.
[02:56:16.640 --> 02:56:21.240]  And, and we just need to, you know, uh, redistribute it back to people who are more deserving.
[02:56:21.240 --> 02:56:23.440]  And a lot of people have fallen for that.
[02:56:23.440 --> 02:56:28.040]  And ultimately the people who suffer the most are the middle class who get wiped out and
[02:56:28.040 --> 02:56:30.560]  the poor who become impoverished even more.
[02:56:30.560 --> 02:56:34.120]  Well, that's it, and they're too stupid to remember what happened a year ago.
[02:56:34.120 --> 02:56:36.320]  And that's the paradox is you have ultra rich.
[02:56:36.320 --> 02:56:37.320]  Most of them are global.
[02:56:37.320 --> 02:56:38.320]  It's leftist.
[02:56:38.320 --> 02:56:39.720]  They're all for socialism because they don't pay the tax.
[02:56:39.720 --> 02:56:40.720]  They're offshore.
[02:56:40.720 --> 02:56:43.560]  They get corporate contracts, government contracts.
[02:56:43.560 --> 02:56:45.920]  And so you got the dumb, you know, unwashed masses.
[02:56:45.920 --> 02:56:48.240]  You got the elites that are totally soulless.
[02:56:48.240 --> 02:56:53.040]  And then they're just screwing over the, the, uh, golden, golden youth here.
[02:56:53.040 --> 02:56:56.000]  There are a lot of very rich Democrats and, you know, they're, they're, they're, they're
[02:56:56.000 --> 02:57:00.480]  probably going to get in trouble here because they're about to get eaten by their own people.
[02:57:00.480 --> 02:57:02.200]  Because, you know, you got all these big billionaires.
[02:57:02.200 --> 02:57:06.600]  I mean, there's some of the wealthiest people have been major contributors to the Democratic
[02:57:06.600 --> 02:57:07.600]  Party.
[02:57:07.600 --> 02:57:08.600]  Exactly.
[02:57:08.600 --> 02:57:13.040]  And now they've manifested a bunch of piranha-like, pro-Venezuela, pro-Somali folks that if you
[02:57:13.040 --> 02:57:17.160]  want to live in a mud hut and be sold into sex slavery, this is who you want to run things.
[02:57:17.160 --> 02:57:19.320]  Peter Schiff, thank you, EuroPack.com.
[02:57:19.320 --> 02:57:20.720]  We'll talk to you soon, my friend.
[02:57:20.720 --> 02:57:21.720]  Sure.
[02:57:21.720 --> 02:57:22.720]  All right.
[02:57:22.720 --> 02:57:24.520]  We're going to come back and Matt Brack is taking over.
[02:57:24.520 --> 02:57:26.440]  And then I'm going to delve into this because here's the deal.
[02:57:26.440 --> 02:57:30.080]  I'm not trying to bring down Joe Rogan just to do it for no reason.
[02:57:30.080 --> 02:57:35.160]  He can't sit there and run his mouth against me with Soros' talking points and not have
[02:57:35.160 --> 02:57:40.680]  me go, dude, you said black people are apes and that black neighborhood is planted in
[02:57:40.680 --> 02:57:41.680]  the apes.
[02:57:41.680 --> 02:57:54.600]  Notice no coverage of that because he's protected.
[02:57:54.600 --> 02:58:01.800]  By leaps and by bounds, the number one best-selling supplement family in the world is energy drinks
[02:58:01.800 --> 02:58:03.200]  and energy supplements.
[02:58:03.200 --> 02:58:08.880]  But they are riddled with dyes and toxins and synthetic caffeine and other chemicals
[02:58:08.880 --> 02:58:13.080]  that sure get you a quick boost but burn out in just a few hours and have terrible side
[02:58:13.080 --> 02:58:14.080]  effects.
[02:58:14.080 --> 02:58:20.240]  We have developed, hands down from our research, the most powerful, healthy energy drink, pre-workout
[02:58:20.240 --> 02:58:23.120]  and beyond system in the world.
[02:58:23.120 --> 02:58:25.560]  There's nothing else like it, you must experience it.

[03:00:11.880 --> 03:00:16.880]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:00:16.880 --> 03:00:23.880]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[03:00:23.880 --> 03:00:41.720]  So, my old friend of 20 years, let him in 1998, Joe Rogan, is a very private guy.
[03:00:41.720 --> 03:00:48.840]  And yesterday, I played this shocking clip we're about to get to of him a few years ago
[03:00:48.840 --> 03:00:53.120]  on the podcast before he moved into his new studio, I guess five, six years ago, saying
[03:00:53.120 --> 03:01:00.160]  that, I'm not saying this, as Joe Rogan said it, that black people are apes and that their
[03:01:00.160 --> 03:01:04.160]  neighborhoods are planet of the apes.
[03:01:04.160 --> 03:01:08.640]  And when I saw that, I'm like, wait a minute, Joe Rogan is married to the very beautiful
[03:01:08.640 --> 03:01:13.800]  daughter of a famous comedian, and he has two biological children with her, two daughters,
[03:01:13.800 --> 03:01:18.840]  I have three daughters and a son, so I empathize, and then, you know, he's got a adopted black
[03:01:18.840 --> 03:01:23.320]  daughter who he loves, and he's very beautiful, by the way, looks like a supermodel.
[03:01:23.320 --> 03:01:28.080]  And so, we can scroll through some of the photos.
[03:01:28.080 --> 03:01:34.800]  So, my issue here, that's Joe Rogan's daughter, she's like 20.
[03:01:34.800 --> 03:01:40.920]  So go through some more of the photos.
[03:01:40.920 --> 03:01:51.000]  So my issue here is, if Governor of Virginia, they're saying resign over being in blackface,
[03:01:51.000 --> 03:01:54.440]  which I don't think you should have to, I think it's, I think it's distasteful, I've
[03:01:54.440 --> 03:01:59.240]  never done it, but if somebody says, hey, it's 30 years ago, 25 years ago, it's a yearbook,
[03:01:59.240 --> 03:02:00.480]  I'll buy it.
[03:02:00.480 --> 03:02:04.760]  But see, he's a leftist who said that other people that did stuff like that should resign
[03:02:04.760 --> 03:02:05.760]  as well.
[03:02:05.760 --> 03:02:08.720]  So now, we're going to go buy your yardstick.
[03:02:08.720 --> 03:02:13.920]  So Joe Rogan sits up there on this high horse, that, you know, I'm this big bad guy because
[03:02:13.920 --> 03:02:17.440]  I questioned Sandy Hook when they're admitting chemical attacks on children were fake and
[03:02:17.440 --> 03:02:23.280]  the BBC today, and so many other cases, I mean, we should question everything, but he's
[03:02:23.280 --> 03:02:29.000]  on this high horse, what does his daughter, I want to call her black, white, just a beautiful
[03:02:29.000 --> 03:02:32.480]  young lady.
[03:02:32.480 --> 03:02:40.440]  What does she call it when her stepfather says that black people are apes and that they're
[03:02:40.440 --> 03:02:44.120]  planted of the apes?
[03:02:44.120 --> 03:02:49.840]  And again, Joe's the one up there pontificating up on this royal high horse about how good
[03:02:49.840 --> 03:02:55.720]  he is and how great he is, and there's Joe's daughter.
[03:02:55.720 --> 03:02:59.080]  So yesterday, I noticed the comments because I went and checked the comments in the video
[03:02:59.080 --> 03:03:04.640]  last night on enforce.com and newswords.com and some were like, Oh, Jones, don't say he's
[03:03:04.640 --> 03:03:05.880]  not a racist.
[03:03:05.880 --> 03:03:07.240]  He doesn't have a black daughter.
[03:03:07.240 --> 03:03:08.480]  Why you don't know that.
[03:03:08.480 --> 03:03:10.400]  So I spent like 20 minutes this morning searching.
[03:03:10.400 --> 03:03:11.400]  I found it.
[03:03:11.400 --> 03:03:21.520]  And once I did, I found the Facebook, the Instagram, all of it and it's just crazy.
[03:03:21.520 --> 03:03:24.480]  So here's how this works.
[03:03:24.480 --> 03:03:26.000]  You defend the establishment.
[03:03:26.000 --> 03:03:28.840]  We then judge you by the establishment's gauge.
[03:03:28.840 --> 03:03:30.320]  I don't think Joe's done anything wrong.
[03:03:30.320 --> 03:03:35.640]  I get his joke because Joe says we're all semi in a way in which we are.
[03:03:35.640 --> 03:03:37.920]  So he's not actually doing that.
[03:03:37.920 --> 03:03:42.760]  But according to your gods of Silicon Valley and your whole measurement system, dude, you're
[03:03:42.760 --> 03:03:46.320]  a really bad person that shouldn't be on the air.
[03:03:46.320 --> 03:03:48.640]  I'm not saying take you off the air.
[03:03:48.640 --> 03:03:50.960]  I'm just saying, Joe.
[03:03:50.960 --> 03:03:56.880]  I've got six more rounds in the cylinder of stuff just as bad or worse.
[03:03:56.880 --> 03:04:00.240]  And like I told you, I'm going to start laying it out every couple of days.
[03:04:00.240 --> 03:04:01.240]  Another one.
[03:04:01.240 --> 03:04:02.240]  Because you judge me.
[03:04:02.240 --> 03:04:03.740]  I'm going to judge you.
[03:04:03.740 --> 03:04:04.740]  Here's the clip.
[03:04:04.740 --> 03:04:05.740]  I'm talking about him on the podcast.
[03:04:05.740 --> 03:04:06.740]  I'm not black.
[03:04:06.740 --> 03:04:07.740]  It's the plan of the apes, man.
[03:04:07.740 --> 03:04:09.240]  We're going to go see plan of the apes.
[03:04:09.240 --> 03:04:12.680]  So I look on the iPhone app and it says, okay, take me to this one.
[03:04:12.680 --> 03:04:13.680]  And the guy goes, okay.
[03:04:13.680 --> 03:04:14.680]  He goes out in a good neighborhood.
[03:04:14.680 --> 03:04:17.360]  He's like, Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, guy barely speaks English.
[03:04:17.360 --> 03:04:18.360]  He takes us there.
[03:04:18.360 --> 03:04:21.080]  We get out and we're giggling, oh, here's the plan of the apes.
[03:04:21.080 --> 03:04:27.360]  We walk into plan of the apes.
[03:04:27.360 --> 03:04:29.880]  We walked into Africa, dude.
[03:04:29.880 --> 03:04:33.320]  We walked in the door and there was no white people.
[03:04:33.320 --> 03:04:35.240]  There was no white people.
[03:04:35.240 --> 03:04:42.440]  So Joe Rogan is the saying that and red band laughs, Joey Diaz stays out.
[03:04:42.440 --> 03:04:47.240]  I mean, can you imagine if I said black people are apes?
[03:04:47.240 --> 03:04:52.720]  Oh, Joe Rogan, 24 hours in, no coverage.
[03:04:52.720 --> 03:04:53.720]  It's okay.
[03:04:53.720 --> 03:04:58.920]  He's anointed for those looking for the ultimate source of energy for their day.

[03:06:02.520 --> 03:06:11.200]  We now take you live to the central Texas command center and the heart of the resistance.
[03:06:11.200 --> 03:06:17.680]  Rallying Patriots worldwide.
[03:06:17.680 --> 03:06:29.200]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show stand up and be counted for what you are about to
[03:06:29.200 --> 03:06:42.200]  receive.
[03:06:42.200 --> 03:07:09.200]  I'm hanging on to the good time stand all my children have a great day.
[03:07:09.200 --> 03:07:22.920]  I'm so blessed for all the line for them, the cards are down.
[03:07:22.920 --> 03:07:27.320]  That Bracken great Patriot best-selling author Navy Shield counterterrorism expert is taking
[03:07:27.320 --> 03:07:33.800]  over, but it's negative if things are when you're at the tip of the spear.
[03:07:33.800 --> 03:07:39.280]  Remember that when we're grinding through the enemy, like a giant juggernaut with our
[03:07:39.280 --> 03:07:47.400]  razor blade plows, it stinks and blood splattering and we're getting shot at and some people
[03:07:47.400 --> 03:07:51.400]  are rolling over the side, but let me tell you about behind us is a swath of destruction
[03:07:51.400 --> 03:07:55.000]  and victory.
[03:07:55.000 --> 03:07:59.560]  People 20 years ago accused me of being a negative 10 years ago, but about four or five years
[03:07:59.560 --> 03:08:04.000]  ago people said, why the hell are you so positive because I just look at the real world and
[03:08:04.000 --> 03:08:08.520]  say what I see and I see victory.
[03:08:08.520 --> 03:08:14.920]  I don't see victory for everybody, but for human souls awakening and activating of every
[03:08:14.920 --> 03:08:20.480]  skin color in every region, but love God, I see explosive awakening.
[03:08:20.480 --> 03:08:24.000]  That's why you see the enemies going from being arrogant, which was great before they
[03:08:24.000 --> 03:08:31.320]  know what we were doing or like sneaking around loading the munitions politically, and once
[03:08:31.320 --> 03:08:36.760]  the bombs went off politically, they're now shitting, they're now crapping their bridges.
[03:08:36.760 --> 03:08:39.160]  So we are devastating the enemy.
[03:08:39.160 --> 03:08:44.360]  You are devastating them and of course they think they can take me and then to demonize
[03:08:44.360 --> 03:08:49.920]  me and crush me and that you're so stupid, you'll think my destruction is a defeat.
[03:08:49.920 --> 03:08:55.120]  Like Santa Anna thought destroying Colonel Travis and the 186 men would like make everybody
[03:08:55.120 --> 03:08:56.120]  lay down.
[03:08:56.120 --> 03:08:57.120]  It did the opposite.
[03:08:57.120 --> 03:09:01.680]  Do I want to die at the Alamo?
[03:09:01.680 --> 03:09:05.840]  Yes.
[03:09:05.840 --> 03:09:06.840]  Not my flesh.
[03:09:06.840 --> 03:09:07.840]  I don't want to die.
[03:09:07.840 --> 03:09:10.160]  I'm not suicidal, but give me a break.
[03:09:10.160 --> 03:09:14.360]  The jobs I've got, the wars I've got to fight, the total commitment.
[03:09:14.360 --> 03:09:16.200]  You think I'm worried about dying.
[03:09:16.200 --> 03:09:18.200]  You think I'm worried about being in prison or torture.
[03:09:18.200 --> 03:09:22.880]  I'm not worried about anything but getting my metaphysical hands around your neck and
[03:09:22.880 --> 03:09:25.800]  strangling you until you're dead.
[03:09:25.800 --> 03:09:29.600]  That's all I want and I will get it.
[03:09:29.600 --> 03:09:31.520]  You demons think you scare us.
[03:09:31.520 --> 03:09:35.920]  No, I'm scared of not destroying you because God will destroy me.
[03:09:35.920 --> 03:09:37.920]  I will get you.
[03:09:37.920 --> 03:09:43.720]  Make no mistake, last thing I do, you're dead, period.
[03:09:43.720 --> 03:09:45.520]  Get ready.
[03:09:45.520 --> 03:09:47.280]  And it's that spirit they fear.
[03:09:47.280 --> 03:09:50.240]  You all have that spirit and we will win.
[03:09:50.240 --> 03:09:54.760]  Nothing will stop us if you just realize that and never stop and think, God, every day,
[03:09:54.760 --> 03:10:00.800]  you're not a Jack Dorsey, you're not a Sundar Pachai, that you don't come from slaves.
[03:10:00.800 --> 03:10:06.640]  Now I'm going to stop right there and let Matt Bracken take over, but thank God you've
[03:10:06.640 --> 03:10:10.200]  got the fire of God in your eyes and you're not with the enemy.
[03:10:10.200 --> 03:10:15.400]  And people say this is an intense sounding, murdering children and having governors talk
[03:10:15.400 --> 03:10:22.720]  about it on TV after they're born should create destruction.
[03:10:22.720 --> 03:10:27.600]  So I'm a wimp and I'm not saying do this, but everyone knows what the real response
[03:10:27.600 --> 03:10:32.360]  to that governor is and I'm not saying do it because you got to be wise as a serpent,
[03:10:32.360 --> 03:10:34.480]  peaceful as a dove.
[03:10:34.480 --> 03:10:40.800]  But the way I behave on air is just a shadow of what God wants and I'm not saying even
[03:10:40.800 --> 03:10:41.800]  do that.
[03:10:41.800 --> 03:10:47.120]  All I'm telling you is let these people dance around in front of us all day.
[03:10:47.120 --> 03:10:51.880]  Let them think they're in control, but get busy in the information war and realize they
[03:10:51.880 --> 03:10:57.840]  will be defeated in the end and realize they're working around the clock to shut us down
[03:10:57.840 --> 03:11:03.600]  because they know there's a fire at Info Wars with our guests and who we are and what we've
[03:11:03.600 --> 03:11:05.560]  done before.
[03:11:05.560 --> 03:11:09.360]  And yes, they've they're obsessed with bloodlines.
[03:11:09.360 --> 03:11:10.360]  They've run my bloodline.
[03:11:10.360 --> 03:11:15.600]  They are crapping their bridges right now, ladies and gentlemen, because they fear you
[03:11:15.600 --> 03:11:18.600]  and they fear me and they fear Matt Bracken coming up.
[03:11:18.600 --> 03:11:24.000]  So I'm just going to tell you, it sounds so cheesy and so ridiculous, but it's a farmer's
[03:11:24.000 --> 03:11:25.720]  understanding of seeds.
[03:11:25.720 --> 03:11:33.000]  If you simply financially support us, you have a commitment from someone who cannot
[03:11:33.000 --> 03:11:34.000]  give up.
[03:11:34.000 --> 03:11:40.680]  There's a difference where won't give up, I can't give up.
[03:11:40.680 --> 03:11:45.320]  My only problem is, is that I get so out of control, I'm so angry that like a race car
[03:11:45.320 --> 03:11:50.120]  driver blows the engine going to 15,000 RPMs.
[03:11:50.120 --> 03:11:52.240]  I don't pray for strength.
[03:11:52.240 --> 03:11:57.480]  I don't pray for I pray for God to hold me back.
[03:11:57.480 --> 03:11:58.640]  And I know you feel the same way.
[03:11:58.640 --> 03:12:01.640]  So I'm just telling you, you claim you're going to fight these big military wars with
[03:12:01.640 --> 03:12:02.640]  the globalists.
[03:12:02.640 --> 03:12:03.640]  Let's not discuss that.
[03:12:03.640 --> 03:12:06.800]  You won't fight the information war now when we're two minutes to midnight.
[03:12:06.800 --> 03:12:10.200]  You'll never fight the real war if we get to that point.
[03:12:10.200 --> 03:12:16.960]  And unfortunately, we all know down the road we are, the planet is collapsing by design,
[03:12:16.960 --> 03:12:18.400]  evil has been turned loose.
[03:12:18.400 --> 03:12:22.880]  You see a good response to it and we're defeating the globalists, the EU's in trouble, the globalists
[03:12:22.880 --> 03:12:26.320]  in trouble, but their counter offensive is coming.
[03:12:26.320 --> 03:12:30.240]  And so I'll tell you again, if you'll just get your coffee from us, you'll drink it
[03:12:30.240 --> 03:12:31.880]  and go, my God, this is incredible.
[03:12:31.880 --> 03:12:36.200]  If you'll just get the protein bars from us, if you'll just get the toothpaste, that's
[03:12:36.200 --> 03:12:37.520]  the highest quality out there.
[03:12:37.520 --> 03:12:44.000]  If you'll just provision us, you have my commitment because I'm literally, it's like bloodstream.
[03:12:44.000 --> 03:12:45.000]  Like my brain's here.
[03:12:45.000 --> 03:12:46.000]  I'm ready to fight.
[03:12:46.000 --> 03:12:47.000]  You're the blood.
[03:12:47.000 --> 03:12:48.000]  And I'm just like, give me the blood.
[03:12:48.000 --> 03:12:49.000]  Give me the blood.
[03:12:49.000 --> 03:12:50.000]  Give me the oxygen.
[03:12:50.000 --> 03:12:51.000]  I need oxygen.
[03:12:51.000 --> 03:12:52.000]  I'm not mad at you.
[03:12:52.000 --> 03:12:53.000]  I'm literally jacked in.
[03:12:53.000 --> 03:12:54.000]  You understand?
[03:12:54.000 --> 03:12:57.480]  Like the more you energize me, the more I'll attack the enemy.
[03:12:57.480 --> 03:13:00.360]  And so whatever God's plan is, I'll do it.
[03:13:00.360 --> 03:13:02.960]  But I hate being fought to a standstill.
[03:13:02.960 --> 03:13:05.280]  I hate watching them look their lips.
[03:13:05.280 --> 03:13:09.040]  I hate thinking, just, just, just, you've done your tour, give up, go away.
[03:13:09.040 --> 03:13:13.480]  And if that's what people want, I'll do it, but they beat, they've beaten a lot of us.
[03:13:13.480 --> 03:13:15.800]  I don't want to give the enemy good propaganda, but I can't lie.
[03:13:15.800 --> 03:13:21.040]  They, they've, they've, they fought us to a standstill after 25 years and they're, they're
[03:13:21.040 --> 03:13:22.680]  doing a lot of nasty stuff behind the scenes.
[03:13:22.680 --> 03:13:26.400]  And I, it doesn't make me scared if I'm sorry for myself, the debt threats and breaking
[03:13:26.400 --> 03:13:30.520]  into lawyers' offices and threatening to kill their kids and you know, all, you know, okay,
[03:13:30.520 --> 03:13:32.240]  I'm not supposed to get into all of it.
[03:13:32.240 --> 03:13:33.480]  It doesn't make me get scared.
[03:13:33.480 --> 03:13:37.000]  It makes me get mad that I'm not strong enough to get them.
[03:13:37.000 --> 03:13:39.720]  And the people just knew how real this was.
[03:13:39.720 --> 03:13:42.160]  So just get your protein bars.
[03:13:42.160 --> 03:13:43.440]  Just get your coffee.
[03:13:43.440 --> 03:13:44.960]  Just get your toothpaste with us.
[03:13:44.960 --> 03:13:48.640]  Just go to infowarestore.com, sign up, get the auto ship, cancel any time.
[03:13:48.640 --> 03:13:52.520]  And I know I've got the fuel like a jet bomber loaded with weapons.
[03:13:52.520 --> 03:13:53.520]  I've got the weapons.
[03:13:53.520 --> 03:13:54.520]  I've got the truth.
[03:13:54.520 --> 03:13:58.400]  And if you give us the money, you better believe that that's what they hate.
[03:13:58.400 --> 03:14:01.040]  They're trying to shut down every minute, try to take our bank accounts.
[03:14:01.040 --> 03:14:02.040]  They took our sponsors.
[03:14:02.040 --> 03:14:04.320]  Everything they did made it stronger for this moment.
[03:14:04.320 --> 03:14:10.080]  But if I get the fuel, I will get in that aircraft and I will go over those enemy bases
[03:14:10.080 --> 03:14:14.480]  and I will metaphysically pull that lever and with everything I've got, looking through
[03:14:14.480 --> 03:14:18.440]  those bomb sites, I will drop those bombs of truth right on their heads.
[03:14:18.440 --> 03:14:19.760]  You have my commitment.
[03:14:19.760 --> 03:14:24.280]  I'll drop them right down their chimneys and I will smile when the jet blows up at the
[03:14:24.280 --> 03:14:27.400]  end of the run and we're going down because it means my job's done.
[03:14:27.400 --> 03:14:32.320]  Don't want to die, but not worried about it because the commitment is such a load.
[03:14:32.320 --> 03:14:33.440]  I don't fear death.
[03:14:33.440 --> 03:14:38.120]  I fear these pedophile bastards having their way and I will not spiritually submit to them
[03:14:38.120 --> 03:14:39.120]  ever.
[03:14:39.120 --> 03:14:41.720]  But this is not just another radio show.
[03:14:41.720 --> 03:14:43.480]  It's not another thousand channels.
[03:14:43.480 --> 03:14:45.360]  It's not all that crap out there.
[03:14:45.360 --> 03:14:46.920]  This is the real resistance.
[03:14:46.920 --> 03:14:47.920]  This is where it starts.
[03:14:47.920 --> 03:14:48.920]  This is real.
[03:14:48.920 --> 03:14:53.760]  This is the response to governors on TV saying they're keeping babies alive and taking their
[03:14:53.760 --> 03:14:54.760]  organs.
[03:14:54.760 --> 03:14:57.080]  This is the response of a man or a hero.
[03:14:57.080 --> 03:15:02.440]  It's a response of somebody who isn't submitting to die, who isn't turning their babies over
[03:15:02.440 --> 03:15:04.120]  to be killed.
[03:15:04.120 --> 03:15:06.280]  I will no longer give in to Satan.
[03:15:06.280 --> 03:15:09.760]  I will no longer back down at any level of these people.
[03:15:09.760 --> 03:15:12.920]  Matt Bracken takes over the other side of the spree.
[03:15:12.920 --> 03:15:18.280]  But they have crushed us down like a sun before it explodes and I can see down the road where
[03:15:18.280 --> 03:15:22.520]  we're going and I don't ever want to get up here and tell you that the enemy's winning.
[03:15:22.520 --> 03:15:27.560]  But if people don't get how serious this is, we're going to lose everything.
[03:15:27.560 --> 03:15:32.800]  Matt Bracken takes over the other side and the war room, three o'clock central.
[03:15:32.800 --> 03:15:37.200]  The damn Soros army prays you don't spread the links.
[03:15:37.200 --> 03:15:38.920]  So do it.
[03:15:38.920 --> 03:15:40.800]  Great job as a crew.
[03:15:40.800 --> 03:16:03.880]  I'll see you back tomorrow, Lord Willough on the Friday Transmission.
[03:16:11.160 --> 03:16:16.040]  Give yourself and your loved ones the excitement and tradition of Slingbow, a new frontier
[03:16:16.040 --> 03:16:20.120]  in archery and truly modern twist on this primitive survival tool.

[03:16:52.960 --> 03:16:54.200]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[03:16:54.200 --> 03:16:58.120]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[03:16:58.120 --> 03:16:59.680]  I sued the IRS in one.
[03:16:59.680 --> 03:17:02.640]  I beat the IRS then and I've been beating them ever since.
[03:17:02.640 --> 03:17:05.920]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement and I've helped thousands of people deal with
[03:17:05.920 --> 03:17:08.160]  tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[03:17:08.160 --> 03:17:09.480]  I can help you too.
[03:17:09.480 --> 03:17:12.480]  If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day.
[03:17:12.480 --> 03:17:14.720]  There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case.
[03:17:14.720 --> 03:17:22.920]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX or go to my website, danpilla.com, that's danpilla.com, danpilla.com.
[03:17:22.920 --> 03:17:26.680]  Most of you know that heart disease is the number one silent killer in the U.S.
[03:17:26.680 --> 03:17:31.440]  What if I told you for just $54.95 a month you could fight against heart disease naturally
[03:17:31.440 --> 03:17:33.360]  at Heart and Body Extract?
[03:17:33.360 --> 03:17:37.280]  Even helping thousands of people get back to a healthier heart, don't just take my word
[03:17:37.280 --> 03:17:38.280]  for it.

[03:17:50.320 --> 03:18:03.640]  Don't risk it when you can take charge of it.
[03:18:03.640 --> 03:18:10.080]  By leaps and by bounds, the number one best selling supplement family in the world is
[03:18:10.080 --> 03:18:15.840]  energy drinks and energy supplements, but they are riddled with dyes and toxins and
[03:18:15.840 --> 03:18:20.400]  synthetic caffeine and other chemicals that sure get you a quick boost but burn out in
[03:18:20.400 --> 03:18:22.720]  just a few hours and have terrible side effects.
[03:18:22.720 --> 03:18:29.320]  We have developed hands down from our research the most powerful, healthy energy drink pre-workout
[03:18:29.320 --> 03:18:31.560]  and beyond system in the world.
[03:18:31.560 --> 03:18:34.600]  If there's nothing else like it, you must experience it.
[03:18:34.600 --> 03:18:39.160]  It is a total game changer and it comes in easy to use, packaged, mixed in with fruit
[03:18:39.160 --> 03:18:41.560]  juice or water, whatever you'd like.
[03:18:41.560 --> 03:18:45.480]  Warning though, it's very, very strong, it lasts 10 hours, so take a half pack at the
[03:18:45.480 --> 03:18:49.480]  first time you take it because TurboForce is named TurboForce because it will take you
[03:18:49.480 --> 03:18:50.480]  into overdrive.
[03:18:50.480 --> 03:18:53.480]  TurboForce and m4slife.com.
[03:18:53.480 --> 03:18:56.560]  If you're not expanding, you're imploding.
[03:18:56.560 --> 03:18:58.280]  There is no set stasis.
[03:18:58.280 --> 03:18:59.520]  There is no managed system.
[03:18:59.520 --> 03:19:01.120]  There is no un-continuum.
[03:19:01.120 --> 03:19:06.800]  The continuum is always launching forward in the future, so you support us and get creative
[03:19:06.800 --> 03:19:07.800]  and get fired up.
[03:19:07.800 --> 03:19:11.000]  We won't just be here 100 years, we'll be here forever, we'll turn the whole thing around.
[03:19:11.000 --> 03:19:15.680]  Our grandchildren on Mars bases and jump bases, and God knows what, are going to look back
[03:19:15.680 --> 03:19:20.280]  and say, we struggled here, we made it, and that's really where this goes.
[03:19:20.280 --> 03:19:24.400]  But yeah, God's got a big war for you, Reddy, and so if you can't face George Soros and
[03:19:24.400 --> 03:19:28.000]  Hillary Clinton and Adolf Hitler and Mao Zedong, are you going to really be able to
[03:19:28.000 --> 03:19:29.520]  face the other stuff?
[03:19:29.520 --> 03:19:33.840]  Because God wants warriors that are smart and are ready to build things and are also
[03:19:33.840 --> 03:19:34.840]  ready to fight.
[03:19:34.840 --> 03:19:38.160]  You don't go to the next level without getting a big weight put on your back, and I don't
[03:19:38.160 --> 03:19:40.120]  know what's going to happen to me in the future.
[03:19:40.120 --> 03:19:44.840]  All I know is, I want to go with the master belt, I want to go to the next level, I want
[03:19:44.840 --> 03:19:49.440]  to be with the spirit that I've experienced, not these devil worshipers, they're cold
[03:19:49.440 --> 03:19:57.400]  and failed and feels like being in a tomb, I want life, I want Jesus.
[03:19:57.400 --> 03:20:14.640]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[03:20:14.640 --> 03:20:21.120]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups, you want to stop tyranny?
[03:20:21.120 --> 03:20:29.120]  Well so does he, live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[03:20:29.120 --> 03:20:37.120]  So discernment is a human intellect interfacing with the universe and God for divine intelligence.
[03:20:37.120 --> 03:20:42.400]  Let me tell you, it's the most pure intelligence you'll ever have.
[03:20:42.400 --> 03:20:46.640]  Interfacing with God is so powerful.
[03:20:46.640 --> 03:20:51.120]  I told you back in October that Trump would declare a national emergency, and that would
[03:20:51.120 --> 03:20:55.760]  be the sign that he was taking the proper action, CNBC now reporting.
[03:20:55.760 --> 03:20:59.320]  They're already announcing the legal challenges.
[03:20:59.320 --> 03:21:04.240]  Trump will sign, spending bill and declare, which is perfect, it doesn't let them stall
[03:21:04.240 --> 03:21:09.000]  the economy, I'm blaming him, a national emergency.
[03:21:09.000 --> 03:21:15.720]  Finally, because Obama signed national emergencies that were unconstitutional in areas that weren't
[03:21:15.720 --> 03:21:19.840]  unconstitutional, like the border or national security, and use that to set up stay-behind
[03:21:19.840 --> 03:21:28.000]  networks that I have been enjoying the attacks from, now mainstream news, $2 billion, hundreds
[03:21:28.000 --> 03:21:33.120]  of millions against, in force, another alternative media, it has not been fun, let me tell you.
[03:21:33.120 --> 03:21:36.800]  But I'm very proud that I'm having to chew dirt with George Washington, get shot at
[03:21:36.800 --> 03:21:41.120]  by Hessians or Redcoats, I've just got to be lied about and sued and attacked.
[03:21:41.120 --> 03:21:45.480]  So we'll have Matt Bracken take over, but this is a big deal.
[03:21:45.480 --> 03:21:48.920]  Trump will sign spending legislation to prevent a government shutdown, declare a national
[03:21:48.920 --> 03:21:53.520]  emergency to build his proposed border wall, Senate Major Leader Mitch McConnell just said
[03:21:53.520 --> 03:22:00.480]  minutes ago, this will be a day long remembered, the president is now actually not engaged
[03:22:00.480 --> 03:22:08.480]  in some police state action, it is his duty, not his right, it's his duty, when you've
[03:22:08.480 --> 03:22:14.360]  got giant caravans and 5 million coming Gallup reports and a total of tax and UN programs,
[03:22:14.360 --> 03:22:19.360]  they'll do what Europe did, defend us or you are the enemy.
[03:22:19.360 --> 03:22:23.680]  We're being attacked, this isn't showmanship, folks, this is normal what men act like to
[03:22:23.680 --> 03:22:26.040]  rally people.
[03:22:26.040 --> 03:22:29.720]  Now Trump again, in the balance, he was doing some things that were wrongs and things that
[03:22:29.720 --> 03:22:36.040]  were right, this puts him into the right column again and these evil courts will say that
[03:22:36.040 --> 03:22:41.480]  they have jurisdiction over him, there's three branches of government, all the lower courts
[03:22:41.480 --> 03:22:44.560]  have overridden the president, but then the higher court always unanimously goes with
[03:22:44.560 --> 03:22:50.800]  him because he goes with the law and in a crisis, the president and the executive is
[03:22:50.800 --> 03:22:55.960]  king, as long as the people support him.
[03:22:55.960 --> 03:22:59.760]  If we had real leadership, I don't want fascism or pen and share helicopters, but my God,
[03:22:59.760 --> 03:23:06.280]  they're helicoptering our babies, killing them when they're already born, they are literally
[03:23:06.280 --> 03:23:10.840]  sexualizing our children, I don't want to do this to these people, but I'm not going
[03:23:10.840 --> 03:23:18.960]  to stand by while they wage war on our unborn children and our born children and wait while
[03:23:18.960 --> 03:23:19.960]  they state some false flag.
[03:23:19.960 --> 03:23:23.320]  So Matt's been waiting, I was already getting ready for another meeting, I was going to
[03:23:23.320 --> 03:23:27.680]  be listening to Matt, but Matt, this is a big deal and this is, thank God, this is such
[03:23:27.680 --> 03:23:31.800]  goodness, Mitch McConnell said it, I hope it's true, I've had about 98% probability
[03:23:31.800 --> 03:23:36.800]  now, how amazing is this Matt Brackett, I mean, we're watching the real second battle,
[03:23:36.800 --> 03:23:41.320]  the first battle founded the nation, the civil war was an interim, but this is really, I
[03:23:41.320 --> 03:23:44.800]  guess, the third battle for the future of the republic, we are living in incredible
[03:23:44.800 --> 03:23:45.800]  times.
[03:23:45.800 --> 03:23:52.800]  Yeah, there's a saying about choosing your battles, you don't want to blow all your political
[03:23:52.800 --> 03:23:59.640]  capital on frivolous things or side issues, but this is the big show, the border is really
[03:23:59.640 --> 03:24:05.840]  the big one and the optics are great, Trump is a showman, he really understands media,
[03:24:05.840 --> 03:24:10.720]  how many times have they counted him out going back to Billy Bush and before that even, but
[03:24:10.720 --> 03:24:16.200]  this is the optical, the optic that he can win, he can go down to the border where those
[03:24:16.200 --> 03:24:23.680]  caravans are aiming for the Arizona and Texas border where there's no fence and he can make
[03:24:23.680 --> 03:24:29.040]  the case that it is an invasion, when you've got communists, you call them NGOs, you have
[03:24:29.040 --> 03:24:32.760]  communists down in El Salvador, Nicaragua, Honduras.
[03:24:32.760 --> 03:24:39.400]  New infunded hardcore commies saying we're coming to overthrow America, declared enemies.
[03:24:39.400 --> 03:24:44.560]  And they're not marching, they show up in a town and they take pictures of them, hooping
[03:24:44.560 --> 03:24:50.080]  it around, but really they're getting on buses now and those buses are not cheap.
[03:24:50.080 --> 03:24:52.720]  Now they're mechanized infantry.
[03:24:52.720 --> 03:24:58.560]  Yeah, there's very, very deep pockets behind this and people need to understand right in
[03:24:58.560 --> 03:25:03.480]  the Constitution, I mean, it's in black and white and I don't know what is going on with
[03:25:03.480 --> 03:25:09.160]  there, I think they're talking heads on the networks, they go into deep esoteric new laws
[03:25:09.160 --> 03:25:14.080]  about the emergency laws, but right in the Constitution, article four sections.
[03:25:14.080 --> 03:25:17.080]  The president is in charge of it, baby.
[03:25:17.080 --> 03:25:20.320]  Right, and shall protect each of them against invasion.
[03:25:20.320 --> 03:25:24.960]  So it says the United States shall guarantee to every state in this union a Republican
[03:25:24.960 --> 03:25:32.120]  form of government, not a democracy like Peter Schiff was talking about in the last hour,
[03:25:32.120 --> 03:25:34.360]  and shall protect each of them against invasion.
[03:25:34.360 --> 03:25:41.200]  It doesn't say he may protect them if the communist government wishes that to be so,
[03:25:41.200 --> 03:25:46.440]  for example, Newsom in California, it says he shall protect each of them against invasion.
[03:25:46.440 --> 03:25:49.680]  Well, what happens when you have a communist government like Newsom?
[03:25:49.680 --> 03:25:52.840]  Well, that's what I just said, exactly.
[03:25:52.840 --> 03:25:57.640]  If you don't, it's not a right, it's a duty, he will execute.
[03:25:57.640 --> 03:26:02.920]  That's right, he shall protect each of them, not if the communist government of that state
[03:26:02.920 --> 03:26:08.640]  requests it, and it's very important for people to understand what's going on in California.
[03:26:08.640 --> 03:26:19.080]  For the youngsters, in my lifetime, California produced Ronald Reagan, it had the referendum
[03:26:19.080 --> 03:26:24.200]  on paying nothing to illegal aliens, no school, no medical, nothing.
[03:26:24.200 --> 03:26:26.280]  And that was overturned by courts.
[03:26:26.280 --> 03:26:29.720]  But this is so clear-cut, defending the border.
[03:26:29.720 --> 03:26:31.640]  We had forts built along the border.
[03:26:31.640 --> 03:26:37.080]  We've sent the army into Mexico many times, I mean, deep into Mexico.
[03:26:37.080 --> 03:26:40.760]  And this is a clear-cut of a case as it gets.
[03:26:40.760 --> 03:26:46.040]  And the media that says, oh, there's no crisis, it's time to call them out for what they are.
[03:26:46.040 --> 03:26:52.760]  They're quizzling traders, they want to turn every state into California, or as I call
[03:26:52.760 --> 03:27:02.000]  it now, Calazuela, because it's a very perfect ironclad socialist formula to take over a
[03:27:02.000 --> 03:27:03.000]  state.
[03:27:03.000 --> 03:27:08.400]  Flood it with illegals, they use motor voter, in California they announce on billboards,
[03:27:08.400 --> 03:27:12.760]  on radio, hey, if you're not here illegally, don't worry about it, come on down and get
[03:27:12.760 --> 03:27:14.480]  your driver's license.
[03:27:14.480 --> 03:27:17.240]  And while you're there, we'll hand you a voter card.
[03:27:17.240 --> 03:27:22.720]  And don't mind about voter fraud because we've never investigated anybody for it.
[03:27:22.720 --> 03:27:29.800]  So right now, California is completely controlled by the socialists and their illegal alien
[03:27:29.800 --> 03:27:30.800]  minions.
[03:27:30.800 --> 03:27:35.280]  And that's what they're going to do in every other state if we don't put a stop to it.
[03:27:35.280 --> 03:27:38.760]  And it has to stop with the border being closed.
[03:27:38.760 --> 03:27:44.880]  As long as you've got tens of thousands of illegals marching in every month.
[03:27:44.880 --> 03:27:50.560]  And then a year later, their kids are in school, then they'll be called the next crop of dreamers.
[03:27:50.560 --> 03:27:51.560]  We're done.
[03:27:51.560 --> 03:27:57.600]  If we can't control the border, this country is done because it's absolute fact that more
[03:27:57.600 --> 03:28:03.040]  than 80% of these third world immigrants will vote Democrat.
[03:28:03.040 --> 03:28:06.840]  They can't speak English, they don't know what the Constitution means.
[03:28:06.840 --> 03:28:11.560]  All they've heard is that in America, the streets are paved with gold and the government
[03:28:11.560 --> 03:28:18.320]  will just hand you a food card, an EBT card that's going to be good for food, for housing,
[03:28:18.320 --> 03:28:21.680]  for medical, for your kid's school, for everything.
[03:28:21.680 --> 03:28:26.120]  All you've got to do is get to America and vote for the Democrats.
[03:28:26.120 --> 03:28:28.280]  And that's the end of our country, folks.
[03:28:28.280 --> 03:28:32.720]  And this is the fight to fight right at the border over the wall.
[03:28:32.720 --> 03:28:36.000]  And we'll be back on the other side of this and pick this up.
[03:28:36.000 --> 03:28:38.440]  I'm really thrilled to hear about the emergency.
[03:28:38.440 --> 03:28:39.440]  It's about time.
[03:28:39.440 --> 03:28:53.440]  We'll be seeing you in a minute.

[03:31:54.640 --> 03:32:00.200]  I've been doing a lot of research into Google and YouTube censorship, and I've noticed
[03:32:00.200 --> 03:32:06.480]  that there's one type of video that is the most censored, the most buried, the most
[03:32:06.480 --> 03:32:07.480]  suppressed.
[03:32:07.480 --> 03:32:14.840]  And that's the videos where you saw in 2016 election night all the arrogant, leftist
[03:32:14.840 --> 03:32:20.520]  authoritarians like the young turds and others get so butt-hurt when Trump won.
[03:32:20.520 --> 03:32:22.440]  They don't want us to have that victory.
[03:32:22.440 --> 03:32:27.960]  They don't want us to remember what political action did, and that's why the globalist
[03:32:27.960 --> 03:32:30.880]  Hillary and others are trying to shut in for us now.
[03:32:30.880 --> 03:32:35.960]  This is a fight about taking your speech away, not just my speech, about taking your very
[03:32:35.960 --> 03:32:37.400]  sovereignty away.
[03:32:37.400 --> 03:32:39.680]  This country is in a war.
[03:32:39.680 --> 03:32:43.480]  So again, I want to thank you for what you've done, but I want to remind you, if you don't
[03:32:43.480 --> 03:32:46.600]  spread the articles and videos, and if you don't financially get the great products we
[03:32:46.600 --> 03:32:50.160]  have and fund us, and the 360 win, we're dead in the water.
[03:32:50.160 --> 03:32:56.960]  I'm in your hands, you're in my hands, infowarstore.com, thank you.
[03:32:56.960 --> 03:33:15.760]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[03:33:15.760 --> 03:33:21.360]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[03:33:21.360 --> 03:33:24.000]  It's Matt Bracken.
[03:33:24.000 --> 03:33:28.200]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[03:33:28.200 --> 03:33:38.840]  Okay, it's pretty hard to top the energy level of Alex in the last couple hours.
[03:33:38.840 --> 03:33:44.960]  I mean, it's not everybody can do that without blowing a rod.
[03:33:44.960 --> 03:33:46.600]  I feel it inside, though.
[03:33:46.600 --> 03:33:47.600]  I do.
[03:33:47.600 --> 03:33:48.600]  I'm a little calmer.
[03:33:48.600 --> 03:33:53.000]  I don't want to bust up my microphones here.
[03:33:53.000 --> 03:33:57.400]  But I appreciate the spirit that drives the man.
[03:33:57.400 --> 03:34:01.560]  And if it wasn't for that spirit, there would be no info wars, there'd be no channel you're
[03:34:01.560 --> 03:34:07.440]  watching, there'd be no videos, there'd be no info wars store to keep it all going.
[03:34:07.440 --> 03:34:12.960]  So I really do appreciate it, and I try to pick up some of that energy.
[03:34:12.960 --> 03:34:21.040]  I might not manifest it in quite exactly the same way, but that strength, that Alex is
[03:34:21.040 --> 03:34:25.880]  like a waterfall or a geyser at times.
[03:34:25.880 --> 03:34:32.160]  It's like a burning fire, and we should all feel some of that and pick some of that up
[03:34:32.160 --> 03:34:34.440]  because it's a rare thing.
[03:34:34.440 --> 03:34:35.680]  It's a rare thing.
[03:34:35.680 --> 03:34:40.200]  There's people with that kind of energy, but that don't have the platform.
[03:34:40.200 --> 03:34:45.800]  And the fact that the powers that be, that the left is trying so hard to shut down info
[03:34:45.800 --> 03:34:52.120]  wars and other alternative channels just shows how much they fear us.
[03:34:52.120 --> 03:34:59.280]  Because honestly, socialism can't exist where there's a free market of ideas because their
[03:34:59.280 --> 03:35:04.640]  ideas are so idiotic and obviously patently stupid.
[03:35:04.640 --> 03:35:10.720]  They can exist in a university because they've made that a monopoly of ideas where alternate
[03:35:10.720 --> 03:35:17.280]  voices are essentially disallowed or kept underground because people are afraid to speak
[03:35:17.280 --> 03:35:23.080]  their mind, and it's increasingly extending into corporate world.
[03:35:23.080 --> 03:35:30.760]  And you can even see it, for example, on the internet, in social media, when you see guys
[03:35:30.760 --> 03:35:38.240]  like Joe Rogan kissing up to Jack Dorsey, basically giving him a free pass and all
[03:35:38.240 --> 03:35:44.480]  but saying, look, I'm your boy, and you cover for me, and don't ban me, and I'll cover
[03:35:44.480 --> 03:35:48.800]  for you, and it's a huge suck up.
[03:35:48.800 --> 03:35:58.720]  I see it even on our side with the cruise ship conservatives, the conservatism Inc guys
[03:35:58.720 --> 03:36:06.040]  that are, they're putting out a conservative message, but they're really just catering
[03:36:06.040 --> 03:36:16.980]  to a clique to the, some would call it controlled opposition or the really manby-pamby GOP elite
[03:36:16.980 --> 03:36:20.480]  type of a crowd, and that's not going to win.
[03:36:20.480 --> 03:36:25.160]  The controlled opposition is a loser strategy.
[03:36:25.160 --> 03:36:30.080]  That's like the Jews and the German ghettos that just said, just obey the laws and everything
[03:36:30.080 --> 03:36:33.360]  will turn out well, it won't turn out well.
[03:36:33.360 --> 03:36:39.120]  At the individual level, you could compare it to what some people call the gray man strategy.
[03:36:39.120 --> 03:36:44.920]  I'm just going to be camouflaged, I'm just going to pretend to go along and get along.
[03:36:44.920 --> 03:36:50.520]  But if everybody is the gray man, which I guess is like the exact bell shape opposite
[03:36:50.520 --> 03:36:56.840]  of Alex Jones, if everybody out there, so-called conservatives all try to be the gray man, do
[03:36:56.840 --> 03:36:59.600]  you know what that actually is?
[03:36:59.600 --> 03:37:05.280]  On a massive scale, that's called surrender, that means the left wins.
[03:37:05.280 --> 03:37:06.920]  We have to push back.
[03:37:06.920 --> 03:37:09.640]  We have to be the burr under the saddle.
[03:37:09.640 --> 03:37:14.640]  We have to throw the cow-trops in their path, otherwise they win.
[03:37:14.640 --> 03:37:19.080]  And if you doubt me, all you have to do is look at what used to be called the golden
[03:37:19.080 --> 03:37:24.880]  state, the greatest state in the country, the richest, the best educational system, the
[03:37:24.880 --> 03:37:31.640]  best highways, in every way, the other states looked up to California and now look at it.
[03:37:31.640 --> 03:37:37.240]  It's turning into a needle and feces strewn Venezuela.
[03:37:37.240 --> 03:37:42.840]  And you think that this bothers the Democrats, the Demsox, the Democratic socialists?
[03:37:42.840 --> 03:37:52.160]  It does not bother them at all because it assures absolute electoral supremacy forever.
[03:37:52.160 --> 03:37:54.120]  And they don't care if they rule the ruins.
[03:37:54.120 --> 03:37:59.880]  They don't care if down at street level the streets are covered with human excrement and
[03:37:59.880 --> 03:38:01.320]  heroin needles.
[03:38:01.320 --> 03:38:06.720]  They don't care because up at the 50th floor and at the ranches that you have to helicopter
[03:38:06.720 --> 03:38:10.160]  into, life is better than ever.
[03:38:10.160 --> 03:38:16.880]  Silicon Valley is great for the millionaires and billionaires who are leftists, but they're
[03:38:16.880 --> 03:38:20.240]  essentially like feudal overlord leftists.
[03:38:20.240 --> 03:38:26.440]  So they don't care if where the middle class used to exist, there's now a flight from the
[03:38:26.440 --> 03:38:31.720]  state being replaced with third world immigrants.
[03:38:31.720 --> 03:38:37.560]  They don't care and not only do they not care, that's the plan for your state.
[03:38:37.560 --> 03:38:44.720]  So when your Democrat and weak Republican politicians aren't strong on the border, what
[03:38:44.720 --> 03:38:50.840]  they're saying is they're winking to each other and laughing at you and saying your
[03:38:50.840 --> 03:38:55.200]  state is the next California, Calazuela.
[03:38:55.200 --> 03:39:04.720]  And if Florida or Texas flips to Democrat, to Democrat socialists, it's over.
[03:39:04.720 --> 03:39:12.760]  In California, I put down some notes, what the formula is, once they get a control of
[03:39:12.760 --> 03:39:17.400]  Congress or the state legislature, they begin to gerrymander.
[03:39:17.400 --> 03:39:24.600]  This makes it harder and harder for any Republican coalition to exist with any kind of power.
[03:39:24.600 --> 03:39:28.760]  Then they pass things that are ridiculous on their face, but hey, they've stood now
[03:39:28.760 --> 03:39:35.000]  for more than a decade, motor voter handing voter cards to illegal aliens and telling
[03:39:35.000 --> 03:39:39.560]  them at the same time, don't worry, nobody's ever been charged with voter fraud.
[03:39:39.560 --> 03:39:43.840]  We don't even have a voter fraud division in California.
[03:39:43.840 --> 03:39:49.360]  So if you happen to accidentally vote, nobody will come after you.
[03:39:49.360 --> 03:39:55.640]  Now they've upped it to something called vote harvesting, where they find out the registered
[03:39:55.640 --> 03:40:00.280]  Democrat voters that haven't voted and go to their house.
[03:40:00.280 --> 03:40:06.480]  And basically like union goons, strong arm them into filling out a ballot and then taking
[03:40:06.480 --> 03:40:11.400]  it in to be counted, not Republicans, just Democrats.
[03:40:11.400 --> 03:40:18.240]  And when that isn't even enough, they'll just do Broward County style ballot stuffing,
[03:40:18.240 --> 03:40:20.640]  which is what they did in Orange County.
[03:40:20.640 --> 03:40:26.080]  When we went to bed at like 10 o'clock one election night, the Republican congressmen
[03:40:26.080 --> 03:40:28.080]  were winning in Orange County.
[03:40:28.080 --> 03:40:30.560]  By the next day, it was flipped.
[03:40:30.560 --> 03:40:38.520]  They had gained so many votes, corrupt fraudulent votes that they won in a Republican stronghold
[03:40:38.520 --> 03:40:39.920]  of Orange County.
[03:40:39.920 --> 03:40:46.000]  So essentially the difference between Broward County, Florida and Orange County, California
[03:40:46.000 --> 03:40:54.880]  was that Broward didn't have an estimate correctly enough that we need 80 or 100,000 false votes
[03:40:54.880 --> 03:40:57.000]  that 60,000 won't be enough.
[03:40:57.000 --> 03:40:59.600]  Well in Orange County, they had enough.
[03:40:59.600 --> 03:41:07.160]  And there, believe me, what they say, when California catches a cold that the whole country
[03:41:07.160 --> 03:41:11.640]  is going to get the flu, I forget how that saying goes.
[03:41:11.640 --> 03:41:18.640]  But this is the model for every state we're going to see in 2020, massive, massive voter
[03:41:18.640 --> 03:41:19.960]  fraud.
[03:41:19.960 --> 03:41:28.240]  Once they get, God forbid, if Trump is either thrown out of office or loses a reelection,
[03:41:28.240 --> 03:41:30.920]  we get a president Kamala Harris.
[03:41:30.920 --> 03:41:34.880]  We're going to see things that are going to make today look like the good old days.
[03:41:34.880 --> 03:41:38.080]  We'll see the electoral college gone.
[03:41:38.080 --> 03:41:40.520]  That'll be the next thing.
[03:41:40.520 --> 03:41:46.240]  The states are already volunteering that they're not going to abide by the electoral breakdown
[03:41:46.240 --> 03:41:54.560]  that whoever wins the majority in their state will basically, whoever wins the popular vote
[03:41:54.560 --> 03:41:59.560]  nationally, I mean, that their state will throw their electoral votes that way.
[03:41:59.560 --> 03:42:08.000]  So this is democracy, the mob rule, taking over against the promise that every state
[03:42:08.000 --> 03:42:10.720]  will be guaranteed a Republican form of government.
[03:42:10.720 --> 03:42:16.840]  When you go all the way back to the 17th Amendment, like in 1912, the Senate wasn't supposed to
[03:42:16.840 --> 03:42:19.080]  be just another Congress.
[03:42:19.080 --> 03:42:23.120]  It was supposed to answer to the state government, not direct election.
[03:42:23.120 --> 03:42:27.880]  So you can see how step by step we've been morphing towards mob rule.
[03:42:27.880 --> 03:42:35.080]  The end of mob rule is Calazuela, and that's coming to every state in the country if we
[03:42:35.080 --> 03:42:36.760]  don't put a stop to it.
[03:42:36.760 --> 03:42:42.120]  And I'm really glad to see that the battle has been joined now, if it's the news is correct,
[03:42:42.120 --> 03:42:46.000]  with the emergency and the border protection.
[03:42:46.000 --> 03:42:50.720]  That's what's coming, and that's the fight that's worth fighting, and we'll talk about
[03:42:50.720 --> 03:43:02.640]  it more on the other side of the break.
[03:43:02.640 --> 03:43:09.040]  By leaps and by bounds, the number one best selling supplement family in the world is
[03:43:09.040 --> 03:43:14.840]  energy drinks and energy supplements, but they are riddled with dyes and toxins and
[03:43:14.840 --> 03:43:19.280]  synthetic caffeine and other chemicals that sure get you a quick boost but burn out in
[03:43:19.280 --> 03:43:21.720]  just a few hours and have terrible side effects.
[03:43:21.720 --> 03:43:28.320]  We have developed, hands down from our research, the most powerful, healthy energy drink, pre-workout
[03:43:28.320 --> 03:43:31.160]  and beyond system in the world.
[03:43:31.160 --> 03:43:33.600]  There's nothing else like it, you must experience it.
[03:43:33.600 --> 03:43:38.160]  It is a total game changer, and it comes in easy to use, packaged, mixed in with fruit
[03:43:38.160 --> 03:43:40.640]  juice or water, whatever you'd like.
[03:43:40.640 --> 03:43:44.480]  Warning though, it's very, very strong, it lasts 10 hours, so take a half packet the
[03:43:44.480 --> 03:43:48.280]  first time you take it because Turbo Force is named Turbo Force because it will take
[03:43:48.280 --> 03:43:50.280]  you into overdrive.

[03:44:19.520 --> 03:44:23.720]  We've been selling a lot of the wound gel and a lot of the Immune Gargle.

[03:46:04.520 --> 03:46:08.320]  Double bars are between $5 and $7 a piece to add whole foods.
[03:46:08.320 --> 03:46:09.320]  This is high end.
[03:46:09.320 --> 03:46:14.960]  When you get one box, you get them at basically $3, you get them for $2.50 or so when you
[03:46:14.960 --> 03:46:17.680]  get it at the current launch discount.
[03:46:17.680 --> 03:46:22.400]  This took over a year to get the top manufacturer and developer in the country to get it all
[03:46:22.400 --> 03:46:26.520]  ready and to have the manufacturing line prepared and to make this.
[03:46:26.520 --> 03:46:28.920]  It's available exclusively at M4sLive.com.

[03:46:51.000 --> 03:46:52.000]  to destroy this country.
[03:46:52.000 --> 03:46:53.000]  It's that simple.
[03:46:53.000 --> 03:47:22.000]  M4sLive.com.
[03:47:23.000 --> 03:47:35.840]  Okay, while we're looking at those nice looking books there, I forgot to mention these two
[03:47:35.840 --> 03:47:44.160]  books, my last two novels, I put them on a free Kindle, Amazon Kindle free run for today.
[03:47:44.160 --> 03:47:54.080]  So you can go and get my last two novels, they're both post dystopian kind of realistic
[03:47:54.080 --> 03:47:55.080]  heroes though.
[03:47:55.080 --> 03:48:02.040]  I don't like the typical guys that can speak 20 languages and parachute down the Kremlin's
[03:48:02.040 --> 03:48:03.040]  chimney.
[03:48:03.040 --> 03:48:04.040]  I don't write that kind of crap.
[03:48:04.040 --> 03:48:10.700]  I try to write stuff that has some good tricks and good lessons and things that actual regular
[03:48:10.700 --> 03:48:12.480]  human beings could do.
[03:48:12.480 --> 03:48:16.960]  Yeah, I was thinking about something that happened last week, I was out at a friend's
[03:48:16.960 --> 03:48:24.200]  farm and this is in rural Virginia or excuse me, Florida, I used to live in Virginia.
[03:48:24.200 --> 03:48:29.320]  And we met a neighbor down at the corner of the property line, just sort of like where
[03:48:29.320 --> 03:48:35.680]  the corner properties meet and it was sort of random event, farmer going by on the tractor.
[03:48:35.680 --> 03:48:41.320]  Long conversation ensued as these things happen and the fellow mentioned he was a Christian
[03:48:41.320 --> 03:48:43.080]  and he was looking forward to the rapture.
[03:48:43.080 --> 03:48:48.120]  He was an older guy, maybe another 10 or 15 years older than me.
[03:48:48.120 --> 03:48:54.880]  And my friend across the fence from this new guy on the tractor said, I hope I don't go
[03:48:54.880 --> 03:48:55.880]  up in the rapture.
[03:48:55.880 --> 03:49:00.720]  Personally, I don't know about the rapture thing, but these guys seem to be on board
[03:49:00.720 --> 03:49:01.720]  with that.
[03:49:01.720 --> 03:49:07.360]  My friend said, I hope I don't go up because there's too much work to be done down here.
[03:49:07.360 --> 03:49:12.800]  The Lord's going to need some soldiers down here to take care of what's coming because
[03:49:12.800 --> 03:49:15.720]  it is going to be, it is going to be a fight.
[03:49:15.720 --> 03:49:22.040]  I'm really glad to see that the president has joined the fight, declaring an emergency,
[03:49:22.040 --> 03:49:23.600]  fighting for the border.
[03:49:23.600 --> 03:49:28.560]  This is something that this is what you call a hill that's worth dying on.
[03:49:28.560 --> 03:49:31.320]  Some things aren't, but this is.
[03:49:31.320 --> 03:49:35.400]  And I don't care what the mainstream media says about it and I don't care what judges
[03:49:35.400 --> 03:49:36.880]  say about it.
[03:49:36.880 --> 03:49:43.360]  The federal judge says that the commander in chief of the United States is not allowed
[03:49:43.360 --> 03:49:49.240]  to defend the borders of the country from an invasion where thousands walk into the
[03:49:49.240 --> 03:49:56.080]  country every day and demographic demographically overturn without the will of the people, without
[03:49:56.080 --> 03:50:02.640]  consulting us, overturn our electoral system as we've seen in Calazuela and happening now
[03:50:02.640 --> 03:50:03.640]  in other states.
[03:50:03.640 --> 03:50:09.320]  I mean, good Lord, who could have ever imagined Virginia turning, turning Democrat?
[03:50:09.320 --> 03:50:15.000]  You drive around Northern Virginia, or as they call it, Yankee occupied Northern Virginia,
[03:50:15.000 --> 03:50:19.200]  you know, above Richmond, you drive around Fairfax County.
[03:50:19.200 --> 03:50:22.480]  All you see is signs in Spanish and Korean.
[03:50:22.480 --> 03:50:23.680]  It's unbelievable.
[03:50:23.680 --> 03:50:29.120]  This has all been done with the knowledge of these Democrat quizlings.
[03:50:29.120 --> 03:50:31.200]  And it's the same governor.
[03:50:31.200 --> 03:50:33.520]  He's just turned loose all the felons to vote.
[03:50:33.520 --> 03:50:43.240]  Do you think that heritage Americans, that actual, you know, been here for centuries
[03:50:43.240 --> 03:50:48.240]  Americans are ever going to win in these states that have been invaded?
[03:50:48.240 --> 03:50:49.440]  No, they're not.
[03:50:49.440 --> 03:50:52.760]  They've been demographically conquered.
[03:50:52.760 --> 03:50:58.920]  And if we can't stop the flow, and at the border is the most important, if we can't
[03:50:58.920 --> 03:51:05.920]  stop the flow, this country's done, it won't matter what you do politically.
[03:51:05.920 --> 03:51:09.040]  Every state is going to be Calazuela.
[03:51:09.040 --> 03:51:13.800]  Then it's going to be on the abolishing the electoral college, and it'll be a straight,
[03:51:13.800 --> 03:51:16.400]  a straight mobocracy.
[03:51:16.400 --> 03:51:19.320]  And that's just what the Democrats have planned for us.
[03:51:19.320 --> 03:51:24.240]  You know, probably everybody has seen the movie Idiocracy.
[03:51:24.240 --> 03:51:27.600]  If you haven't, I highly recommend that you watch it.
[03:51:27.600 --> 03:51:33.960]  But I have one difference, you know, I actually believe that the movie Idiocracy is coming
[03:51:33.960 --> 03:51:36.880]  true right before our eyes.
[03:51:36.880 --> 03:51:44.600]  But whereas in the movie, the president is a, you know, ex-wrestler, porn star, moron
[03:51:44.600 --> 03:51:53.920]  named, I think, Camacho, in reality, and they rely on a soldier who wakes up from a cryogenic
[03:51:53.920 --> 03:51:57.880]  experiment to, you know, guide them back to sanity.
[03:51:57.880 --> 03:52:02.040]  In reality, it's not a president Camacho.
[03:52:02.040 --> 03:52:10.040]  It's a president, you know, in the real Idiocracy, you have very smart and evil leaders who know
[03:52:10.040 --> 03:52:14.120]  exactly what they're doing and why they're doing it.
[03:52:14.120 --> 03:52:19.200]  They don't ever admit it publicly, but what they're doing, and this is the formula that
[03:52:19.200 --> 03:52:21.520]  I come back to.
[03:52:21.520 --> 03:52:29.000]  It's Dunning Kruger plus Cloward Piven equals the Demsoc strategy.
[03:52:29.000 --> 03:52:35.440]  Dunning Kruger means you have so many people that are basically morons.
[03:52:35.440 --> 03:52:40.660]  When people are fairly dim and they don't get what they want, they get angry.
[03:52:40.660 --> 03:52:42.160]  They don't just get confused.
[03:52:42.160 --> 03:52:44.560]  They actually think, I should have it, damn it.
[03:52:44.560 --> 03:52:46.560]  I should have what I see on TV.
[03:52:46.560 --> 03:52:48.160]  And when they don't, they get angry.
[03:52:48.160 --> 03:52:50.520]  This is a pretty normal reaction.
[03:52:50.520 --> 03:52:56.640]  And what demagogues do, people that are very intelligent and they know better, they say,
[03:52:56.640 --> 03:52:58.960]  your anger is justified.
[03:52:58.960 --> 03:53:06.760]  The reason you're angry is because those scapegoats over there have taken what should be yours.
[03:53:06.760 --> 03:53:08.760]  In Germany, it was the Jews.
[03:53:08.760 --> 03:53:12.000]  Now it's white Christian men, conservatives.
[03:53:12.000 --> 03:53:14.400]  We're being set up for the next scapegoats.
[03:53:14.400 --> 03:53:19.960]  It's a very extremely evil strategy that they're pulling.
[03:53:19.960 --> 03:53:26.760]  And it's depending for the time being, the Democrat policy, on an intersectional identity
[03:53:26.760 --> 03:53:32.120]  alliance where you draw together all these disparate minority groups and you cobble
[03:53:32.120 --> 03:53:34.640]  them together into a coalition.
[03:53:34.640 --> 03:53:42.040]  But it's a very weak strategy going forward because it can only exist in a realm that's
[03:53:42.040 --> 03:53:47.200]  controlled by political correctness, where you're not allowed to say that it's evil
[03:53:47.200 --> 03:53:53.760]  to dress up a little six-year-old boy as a drag queen and have adult homosexual men
[03:53:53.760 --> 03:53:56.520]  putting dollars in his pants.
[03:53:56.520 --> 03:54:04.480]  Where you're afraid to say it's evil, it's wrong to abort babies at the moment of birth.
[03:54:04.480 --> 03:54:08.240]  And if you do the mainstream media, they won't say a word.
[03:54:08.240 --> 03:54:14.040]  They were a little bit worried about the black face, but they don't give a damn at all about
[03:54:14.040 --> 03:54:18.120]  post-birth abortion, fourth trimester abortion.
[03:54:18.120 --> 03:54:19.840]  This is pure evil.
[03:54:19.840 --> 03:54:25.800]  But when the string finally plays out, as Peter Schiff was talking about in the last
[03:54:25.800 --> 03:54:31.600]  hour, eventually the Democrats blow up the economy, the dollar is worthless, it's no
[03:54:31.600 --> 03:54:37.000]  more than a ruble inflated like Venezuela and Bolivars.
[03:54:37.000 --> 03:54:42.480]  And the next thing is going to happen is a complete collapse of the EBT system.
[03:54:42.480 --> 03:54:45.280]  The country is going to go completely off the rails.
[03:54:45.280 --> 03:54:48.900]  At that point, political correctness goes out the window.
[03:54:48.900 --> 03:54:55.120]  And when political correctness is gone, this identity politics alliance is bound to fracture
[03:54:55.120 --> 03:55:03.120]  because Latinos and homosexuals and transsexuals, in the end, all of these splinter groups
[03:55:03.120 --> 03:55:05.000]  have nothing in common.
[03:55:05.000 --> 03:55:12.480]  Whereas the core heritage Americans, those of us who were born and raised in the America
[03:55:12.480 --> 03:55:17.680]  of days gone by, not saying it was perfect, but it was strong.
[03:55:17.680 --> 03:55:23.800]  And what our group has been doing, we've been studying this political situation, whereas
[03:55:23.800 --> 03:55:31.600]  you have idiots like AOC, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, they are so stupid that they think that they
[03:55:31.600 --> 03:55:40.360]  can just spin like a golden thread on a spinning wheel.
[03:55:40.360 --> 03:55:45.760]  They think that they can just spin trillions of dollars out of thin air, they're so ignorant.
[03:55:45.760 --> 03:55:51.000]  On the other hand, conservatives have been studying the rise and fall of empires and
[03:55:51.000 --> 03:55:52.520]  of economies.
[03:55:52.520 --> 03:55:57.120]  We know how communism comes to rise.
[03:55:57.120 --> 03:56:03.120]  We've understood and studied every revolution, the French Revolution, Bolshevik Revolution.
[03:56:03.120 --> 03:56:07.880]  We know that they can't succeed until we're disarmed.
[03:56:07.880 --> 03:56:09.800]  And that's not going to happen.
[03:56:09.800 --> 03:56:12.400]  We'll never allow them to disarm us.
[03:56:12.400 --> 03:56:17.960]  So they think that they're going to ride towards some kind of a socialist utopia, which we
[03:56:17.960 --> 03:56:23.480]  know always fails, but all they're going to get instead is a civil war.
[03:56:23.480 --> 03:56:30.200]  And I don't know about the left, but my friends have been buying weapons and training, buying
[03:56:30.200 --> 03:56:31.680]  ammunition and training.
[03:56:31.680 --> 03:56:35.320]  And there's a saying I like to repeat.
[03:56:35.320 --> 03:56:42.920]  Those who don't know what zeroing a rifle means should not pick a fight with those who
[03:56:42.920 --> 03:56:47.120]  have and do understand what zeroing a rifle means.
[03:56:47.120 --> 03:56:53.440]  And people that do have zeroed rifles, eventually it's not going to be faculty lounge rule
[03:56:53.440 --> 03:56:56.120]  rules, be a political correctness.
[03:56:56.120 --> 03:57:01.960]  It's going to be who's got the food, who's got the fuel, and who can deliver it.
[03:57:01.960 --> 03:57:03.240]  That's what's coming.
[03:57:03.240 --> 03:57:05.280]  So we need to harden our hearts.
[03:57:05.280 --> 03:57:10.320]  We need to gird for a long battle because it's coming.
[03:57:10.320 --> 03:57:15.320]  It may be next month or it may be after the 2020 elections, who knows.
[03:57:15.320 --> 03:57:21.200]  But I'm glad to see that the battle is now out in the open with President Trump taking
[03:57:21.200 --> 03:57:24.480]  care of the border finally, but we'll see.
[03:57:24.480 --> 03:57:31.320]  Time is going to tell and that's it for me today and we'll be back, I'll be back in
[03:57:31.320 --> 03:57:35.480]  two weeks, God willing, and freak their prize.
