[00:47.000 --> 00:51.000]  you know why that's happening because they're having open discussions in the
[00:51.000 --> 00:56.000]  councils of government around the world how to kill the dollar they have come to
[00:56.000 --> 01:00.000]  a consensus I have a stack of mainstream financial reports here mainstream
[01:00.000 --> 01:05.000]  news saying oh we decided to kill the dollar we've just deciding how to do it
[01:05.000 --> 01:09.000]  without the American people rioting we're just trying to get more riot police
[01:09.000 --> 01:14.000]  and more FEMA camps in place and more more cops it'll help Billy club their
[01:14.000 --> 01:18.000]  people's heads in while the foreign banks destroy America then the cops will wake
[01:18.000 --> 01:24.000]  up completely bankrupt but hey that's how they roll and so we're going to be
[01:24.000 --> 01:31.000]  talking about that today you know I try to remain calm here on the show and I
[01:31.000 --> 01:36.000]  try to have you know what you call controlled rage and but when I control
[01:36.000 --> 01:42.000]  my rage I just start getting a smart mouth I'm gonna be honest with you I am I
[01:42.000 --> 01:46.000]  don't hate the police I don't hate the military in fact I have a lot of family
[01:46.000 --> 01:50.000]  that are police and military or been police or military I know they're buying
[01:50.000 --> 01:54.000]  large good people macho guys they'd be fun to go deer hunting with you know in
[01:54.000 --> 02:00.000]  Colorado but I want to tell you something you're gonna wish to you know
[02:00.000 --> 02:03.000]  what you'd have done something about this and that goes for the American people
[02:03.000 --> 02:08.000]  in general as well I just can't handle it anymore I mean I'm gonna be honest
[02:08.000 --> 02:11.000]  with you watching a bunch of corrupt banks rape the hell out of my country
[02:11.000 --> 02:15.000]  watch a classical police state with police chief saying oh yes spy on your
[02:15.000 --> 02:21.000]  neighbors tattle on everyone face scanning cameras going in passive MRIs going
[02:21.000 --> 02:28.000]  in and then the denial of some of the people out there but I'm gonna try to
[02:28.000 --> 02:32.000]  not start yelling and screaming you know you'd think I'd be happy being right in
[02:32.000 --> 02:35.000]  the last five years telling you to buy gold back when it was 300 bucks an ounce
[02:35.000 --> 02:40.000]  and it's now a thousand forty all-time record broken I'm not happy at all right
[02:40.000 --> 02:48.000]  now I told my wife this morning I didn't have to tell her she's smart got a woman's
[02:48.000 --> 02:54.000]  intuition she knows it's like we're going over the waterfall here a big steep
[02:54.000 --> 02:59.000]  waterfall 500 foot waterfall and it's not a fun ride over the edge at least
[02:59.000 --> 03:04.000]  racing for impact and the general public are in their inner tubes with their
[03:04.000 --> 03:09.000]  thumbs up their noses and somewhere else talking about Brett Farve and how
[03:09.000 --> 03:19.000]  great it is the Vikings beat the Packers last night and you know that's
[03:19.000 --> 03:23.000]  interesting a 40 year old Brett Farve very interesting you know I was
[03:23.000 --> 03:27.000]  watching CNN this morning while I was jogging on the treadmill I focused on
[03:27.000 --> 03:32.000]  what was interesting and admire the tribal leader Brett Farve he's the warrior
[03:32.000 --> 03:37.000]  he can defeat the simulated enemy but it's all simulated doesn't matter to my
[03:37.000 --> 03:40.000]  family in the real equation it's a dangerous distraction just like David
[03:40.000 --> 03:44.000]  Letterman having sex with women on his you know and now he was Barney Frank
[03:44.000 --> 03:48.000]  with an underage brothel of young boys he'd be just fine but you know we gotta
[03:48.000 --> 03:54.000]  obsess all day over David Letterman and people trying to extort him or John
[03:54.000 --> 04:00.000]  people trying to extort him that's part of the course in America I have people
[04:00.000 --> 04:03.000]  try to extort me about a year and a half ago here locally in Austin over non
[04:03.000 --> 04:14.000]  issues I said go ahead jackass but the point is that that stuff doesn't matter
[04:14.000 --> 04:19.000]  let me tell you something all we've got left is the dollar and I know most of the
[04:19.000 --> 04:22.000]  listeners are smarter than I am and know that but let me tell you something your

[07:11.000 --> 07:13.000]  we all pray they stand down
[07:13.000 --> 07:17.000]  but an engineered crisis seems more likely with each passing day
[07:17.000 --> 07:19.000]  think it can't happen here
[07:19.000 --> 07:23.000]  executive order 10,990 locks down all highways

[08:04.000 --> 08:06.000]  the alex jones show
[08:06.000 --> 08:09.000]  because there's a war on for your mind
[08:10.000 --> 08:13.000]  well the headlines all basically read the same
[08:13.000 --> 08:19.000]  dollar plunging gold reaches all time high on dollar weakness
[08:19.000 --> 08:23.000]  open announcements by the g20 last week
[08:23.000 --> 08:27.000]  and the week before last open announcements by the British government
[08:27.000 --> 08:29.000]  the French government the Russian government
[08:29.000 --> 08:32.000]  the Japanese government the Chinese government
[08:32.000 --> 08:35.000]  open announcements by the Arabs but our media makes it about the Arabs
[08:35.000 --> 08:37.000]  I've been saying this the last two years
[08:37.000 --> 08:39.000]  that have been watching their playbook
[08:39.000 --> 08:41.000]  when they finally kill the dollar
[08:41.000 --> 08:43.000]  they're gonna blame it on Arabs
[08:43.000 --> 08:47.000]  the average American will point to South American believe that's where we've got a bomb
[08:47.000 --> 08:48.000]  because that's where the Arabs live
[08:48.000 --> 08:54.000]  literally can't even find their own over 80% of Americans can't find their own state capital on a map
[08:54.000 --> 08:55.000]  in major studies that have been done
[08:55.000 --> 08:56.000]  I'm not trying to be mean
[08:56.000 --> 08:58.000]  they know all about Brett Farr
[08:58.000 --> 09:02.000]  they know all about the extortion deal with John Kerr-Volton
[09:02.000 --> 09:04.000]  the extortion deal with David Letterman
[09:04.000 --> 09:07.000]  they know all about how to apply cosmetics
[09:07.000 --> 09:11.000]  girls know all about how to make their hair look fancy
[09:11.000 --> 09:12.000]  and to put perfume on
[09:12.000 --> 09:15.000]  and they read all the sexual allure tricks
[09:15.000 --> 09:19.000]  you know in the women's magazines and the men know how to act steadily
[09:19.000 --> 09:21.000]  and strut around and bug their eyes out
[09:21.000 --> 09:22.000]  grunting
[09:22.000 --> 09:26.000]  they know all about the supplements to boost their testosterone
[09:26.000 --> 09:29.000]  but they don't know anything about this blue jewel
[09:29.000 --> 09:33.000]  blasting at 30 something thousand miles an hour through deep space
[09:33.000 --> 09:36.000]  orbiting a standard star
[09:36.000 --> 09:39.000]  two-thirds of the way out on the spiral arm of the Milky Way Galaxy
[09:39.000 --> 09:42.000]  they don't know about neurons in the brain
[09:42.000 --> 09:47.000]  they don't know about fold space, quantum mechanics, electrical engineering
[09:47.000 --> 09:49.000]  they don't know about tribal psychology
[09:49.000 --> 09:53.000]  they don't understand algorithms of human development, societal evolution
[09:53.000 --> 09:56.000]  they don't understand sociology, anthropology
[09:56.000 --> 09:58.000]  they don't understand any of it
[09:58.000 --> 10:01.000]  of the incredible majesty we're in the middle of
[10:01.000 --> 10:05.000]  and they don't care that a bunch of inbred jackass, new world order people
[10:05.000 --> 10:07.000]  that do care about that are in control
[10:07.000 --> 10:10.000]  the con artists know how to work people
[10:10.000 --> 10:12.000]  they know they get power out of it
[10:12.000 --> 10:14.000]  but good people don't
[10:14.000 --> 10:17.000]  good people don't seem to care
[10:17.000 --> 10:20.000]  and so we get overrun, over and over again
[10:20.000 --> 10:22.000]  by control freaks
[10:22.000 --> 10:24.000]  and scum
[10:24.000 --> 10:27.000]  and people that only like petty power over the flesh
[10:27.000 --> 10:28.000]  in human realms
[10:28.000 --> 10:30.000]  not in the larger realm
[10:30.000 --> 10:32.000]  of reaching towards the stars
[10:32.000 --> 10:34.000]  the destiny of this society
[10:34.000 --> 10:36.000]  the destiny of this species
[10:36.000 --> 10:38.000]  the new world order is at complete
[10:38.000 --> 10:41.000]  longer heads with the true destiny of humanity
[10:41.000 --> 10:43.000]  the colonized space
[10:43.000 --> 10:45.000]  to believe in the human spirit
[10:45.000 --> 10:47.000]  to try to empower and enlighten and bring forward
[10:47.000 --> 10:50.000]  that's what I burn with desire
[10:50.000 --> 10:52.000]  that is my absolute wish
[10:52.000 --> 10:55.000]  is to abolish all forms of tyranny over the minds of man
[10:55.000 --> 10:58.000]  I am totally in league with Thomas Jefferson
[10:58.000 --> 11:02.000]  and I don't know how any of you wouldn't want to be in league with this
[11:02.000 --> 11:05.000]  I feel sorry for the cops beating up students
[11:05.000 --> 11:08.000]  and lying about them and framing people and violating the First Amendment
[11:08.000 --> 11:10.000]  I feel sorry for the military
[11:10.000 --> 11:14.000]  when they carry out these tyrannical operations to control opium in Afghanistan
[11:14.000 --> 11:16.000]  and oil in Iraq
[11:16.000 --> 11:19.000]  I feel sorry for you because you're missing out on
[11:19.000 --> 11:21.000]  truly being on the side of the good guys
[11:21.000 --> 11:23.000]  you think you're the good guys
[11:23.000 --> 11:25.000]  but look at yourselves in the mirror
[11:25.000 --> 11:27.000]  look at your uniforms, look at your nomenclature
[11:27.000 --> 11:29.000]  look at your attitudes
[11:29.000 --> 11:31.000]  you are not on the side of good
[11:31.000 --> 11:33.000]  unless you get your head right
[11:33.000 --> 11:37.000]  and get into the spirit of 1776
[11:37.000 --> 11:39.000]  now I said I'm going to do a news blitz
[11:39.000 --> 11:41.000]  it's just
[11:41.000 --> 11:44.000]  I've been announcing to my crew in the office
[11:44.000 --> 11:46.000]  I've been calling the Watsons in England
[11:46.000 --> 11:48.000]  I've been calling Curt Nemo in New Mexico
[11:48.000 --> 11:50.000]  I've been calling my family
[11:50.000 --> 11:52.000]  and I've been telling them the last month
[11:52.000 --> 11:55.000]  I've told them officially we are now inside the New World Order
[11:55.000 --> 11:57.000]  and I want to just tell the audience that
[11:57.000 --> 12:00.000]  I want to do a whole show on this later in the week or next week
[12:00.000 --> 12:02.000]  I may even take some time off this week just to meditate on this
[12:02.000 --> 12:04.000]  and really try to collect my thoughts
[12:04.000 --> 12:06.000]  because when I'm not on air I totally understand what's happening
[12:06.000 --> 12:08.000]  I can articulate it
[12:08.000 --> 12:10.000]  the thought patterns are much more crystallized
[12:10.000 --> 12:12.000]  and I get on air and it's just
[12:12.000 --> 12:14.000]  it's just frustrating
[12:14.000 --> 12:16.000]  and I just get angry
[12:16.000 --> 12:18.000]  but when I quietly am thinking about this
[12:18.000 --> 12:20.000]  or when I'm jogging or when I'm
[12:20.000 --> 12:22.000]  going to bed at 10 o'clock at night
[12:22.000 --> 12:24.000]  I'm trying to go to bed earlier
[12:24.000 --> 12:26.000]  it's just so clear what we're facing
[12:26.000 --> 12:28.000]  how to deal with it, how to counter it
[12:28.000 --> 12:30.000]  I understand the mind of the enemy
[12:30.000 --> 12:32.000]  I understand all their moves
[12:32.000 --> 12:34.000]  I know what they're going to do
[12:34.000 --> 12:36.000]  I know how to beat these people
[12:36.000 --> 12:38.000]  but they have weakened us
[12:38.000 --> 12:40.000]  they have turned us against each other
[12:40.000 --> 12:42.000]  they have made us decadent evil slobs
[12:42.000 --> 12:44.000]  the New World Order makes evil look cool
[12:44.000 --> 12:46.000]  and fun so you can be weakened
[12:46.000 --> 12:48.000]  your spiritual immune system has to be brought down
[12:48.000 --> 12:50.000]  so they can take you over
[12:50.000 --> 12:52.000]  so you will be blind
[12:52.000 --> 12:54.000]  so you can be fed on
[12:54.000 --> 12:56.000]  I've read reports of some prize snakes
[12:56.000 --> 12:58.000]  where they will amputate
[12:58.000 --> 13:00.000]  the legs and poke out the eyes
[13:00.000 --> 13:02.000]  of the guinea pigs or other
[13:02.000 --> 13:04.000]  animals, piglets, things they feed to them
[13:04.000 --> 13:06.000]  so they don't scratch and hurt the snake
[13:06.000 --> 13:08.000]  and that's what America
[13:08.000 --> 13:10.000]  and the world is but we're the models
[13:10.000 --> 13:12.000]  so is England, we're the two models of this
[13:12.000 --> 13:14.000]  we've had our eyes poked out
[13:14.000 --> 13:16.000]  we're mindless gibbering
[13:16.000 --> 13:18.000]  guinea pigs
[13:18.000 --> 13:20.000]  being dropped into a pit
[13:20.000 --> 13:22.000]  with a big old snake that eats us
[13:22.000 --> 13:24.000]  and I'm tired of watching my fellow people
[13:24.000 --> 13:26.000]  fed on, I don't care if you're Hispanic
[13:26.000 --> 13:28.000]  black, white, German, Jewish, Chinese
[13:28.000 --> 13:30.000]  they want to divide us
[13:30.000 --> 13:32.000]  they want to make it all about race
[13:32.000 --> 13:34.000]  they want to divide us along religion
[13:34.000 --> 13:36.000]  they use all of this to control us
[13:38.000 --> 13:40.000]  and there are legitimate differences
[13:40.000 --> 13:42.000]  of opinion with groups and there are tribal
[13:42.000 --> 13:44.000]  groups and there are groups and there are
[13:44.000 --> 13:46.000]  mafias and people are fighting with each other
[13:46.000 --> 13:48.000]  and that is how humans arrange themselves
[13:48.000 --> 13:50.000]  but I'm telling you if we don't have a big
[13:50.000 --> 13:52.000]  revelation, an awakening, an understanding
[13:52.000 --> 13:54.000]  of this
[13:54.000 --> 13:56.000]  how did the old timers know
[13:56.000 --> 13:58.000]  50 years ago when they set up
[13:58.000 --> 14:00.000]  the Department of Education
[14:00.000 --> 14:02.000]  to start taking over education that it was
[14:02.000 --> 14:04.000]  quote, Nazi or Soviet
[14:04.000 --> 14:06.000]  that they wanted to break up the family
[14:06.000 --> 14:08.000]  because we had veterans who'd been in Russia
[14:08.000 --> 14:10.000]  and been in Germany and been in places
[14:10.000 --> 14:12.000]  and seen what had been done there
[14:12.000 --> 14:14.000]  but now in 2009
[14:14.000 --> 14:16.000]  we have hundreds of government textbooks
[14:16.000 --> 14:18.000]  and we list their names every day here
[14:18.000 --> 14:20.000]  and publish them and post them and scan them
[14:20.000 --> 14:22.000]  where the government states
[14:22.000 --> 14:24.000]  it wants to break up the family and take over your life
[14:24.000 --> 14:26.000]  I mean it's not like
[14:26.000 --> 14:28.000]  we just sit here and go, gee, when local police
[14:28.000 --> 14:30.000]  tell you to spy on your neighbors
[14:30.000 --> 14:32.000]  and when they say you can't maybe sit your neighbors' kids
[14:32.000 --> 14:34.000]  without a license, when they say homeschooling
[14:34.000 --> 14:36.000]  is illegal and when they say you've got to take
[14:36.000 --> 14:38.000]  forced inoculations
[14:38.000 --> 14:40.000]  and when they are building
[14:40.000 --> 14:42.000]  prison camps everywhere, man, we're in a lot
[14:42.000 --> 14:44.000]  of trouble, this is the government
[14:44.000 --> 14:46.000]  social engineering
[14:46.000 --> 14:48.000]  a scientific dictatorship
[14:48.000 --> 14:50.000]  that's not our opinion, the establishment calls
[14:50.000 --> 14:52.000]  it a scientific dictatorship
[14:52.000 --> 14:54.000]  I mean, they're telling us
[14:54.000 --> 14:56.000]  what they're doing, this is an old
[14:56.000 --> 14:58.000]  timer's 50 years ago before they had
[14:58.000 --> 15:00.000]  textbooks on it, recognizing what
[15:00.000 --> 15:02.000]  it was and warning us, thank God
[15:02.000 --> 15:04.000]  they were the early warning system
[15:04.000 --> 15:06.000]  and they got made fun of and laughed at
[15:06.000 --> 15:08.000]  this isn't people 50 years, this is
[15:08.000 --> 15:10.000]  admitted people
[15:10.000 --> 15:12.000]  that's admitted
[15:12.000 --> 15:14.000]  they're poisoning our water supply, it's admitted
[15:14.000 --> 15:16.000]  they're chemtrailing us
[15:16.000 --> 15:18.000]  okay, here's the deal
[15:18.000 --> 15:20.000]  I'm going to try to calmly go over the demise
[15:20.000 --> 15:22.000]  of the dollar, that's openly being trumpeted right now
[15:22.000 --> 15:24.000]  the trumpeting of the killing
[15:24.000 --> 15:26.000]  of the dollar is how they kill it
[15:26.000 --> 15:28.000]  then I got a stack
[15:28.000 --> 15:30.000]  of flu news off the charts
[15:30.000 --> 15:32.000]  I got big hardened Montana developments
[15:32.000 --> 15:34.000]  big, the biggest yet
[15:34.000 --> 15:36.000]  and I've got a bunch of other
[15:36.000 --> 15:38.000]  police state and second amendment news
[15:38.000 --> 15:40.000]  all over the country, they're attacking the second
[15:40.000 --> 15:42.000]  at the state level
[15:42.000 --> 15:44.000]  and I've got the LA Times
[15:44.000 --> 15:46.000]  legislation
[15:46.000 --> 15:48.000]  requiring ID and thumbprint to purchase
[15:48.000 --> 15:50.000]  handgun ammo and then it's going to be all ammo
[15:50.000 --> 15:52.000]  thumbprinting biometrically
[15:52.000 --> 15:54.000]  I always told you that was the plan
[15:54.000 --> 15:56.000]  and then it's going to be for the national ID card
[15:56.000 --> 15:58.000]  for your carbon footprint, you're going to thumbprint
[15:58.000 --> 16:00.000]  that's official government
[16:00.000 --> 16:02.000]  department of labor, department of commerce
[16:02.000 --> 16:04.000]  have openly stated it, they're starting to buy
[16:04.000 --> 16:06.000]  law to ban trans fat, sounds reasonable
[16:06.000 --> 16:08.000]  they're going to tax anything they say is unhealthy
[16:08.000 --> 16:10.000]  they're going to track everything, folks
[16:10.000 --> 16:12.000]  listen to me, this is hell on earth
[16:12.000 --> 16:14.000]  they're announcing
[16:14.000 --> 16:16.000]  passive MRIs, body scanning
[16:16.000 --> 16:18.000]  you on the streets going in, not just in
[16:18.000 --> 16:20.000]  over 100 airports, naked body
[16:20.000 --> 16:22.000]  scanners
[16:22.000 --> 16:24.000]  are going in nationwide, ladies and gentlemen
[16:24.000 --> 16:26.000]  they mean business
[16:26.000 --> 16:28.000]  and let me tell you something
[16:28.000 --> 16:30.000]  oh
[16:30.000 --> 16:32.000]  let's cover the
[16:32.000 --> 16:34.000]  financial news first, dollar demise
[16:34.000 --> 16:36.000]  inexorable but not sudden
[16:38.000 --> 16:40.000]  that's one headline, here is
[16:40.000 --> 16:42.000]  the London telegraph
[16:42.000 --> 16:44.000]  today
[16:44.000 --> 16:46.000]  the demise of
[16:46.000 --> 16:48.000]  the dollar
[16:48.000 --> 16:50.000]  in a graphic illustration of the new world order
[16:50.000 --> 16:52.000]  that's the first headline
[16:52.000 --> 16:54.000]  Arab states have launched secret moves with China
[16:54.000 --> 16:56.000]  Russia and France to stop using US currency
[16:56.000 --> 16:58.000]  for oil trading, that was always the plan
[16:58.000 --> 17:00.000]  with the euro, to switch to it for a while
[17:00.000 --> 17:02.000]  and then do SDR's global currency
[17:02.000 --> 17:04.000]  oil states
[17:04.000 --> 17:06.000]  are replacing it, gold surges
[17:06.000 --> 17:08.000]  to record high above $1040
[17:08.000 --> 17:10.000]  right now, I'm going to break all this
[17:10.000 --> 17:12.000]  down
[17:12.000 --> 17:14.000]  but first I wanted to go to Ted Anderson
[17:14.000 --> 17:16.000]  Ted Anderson, I talked to you
[17:16.000 --> 17:18.000]  this morning when gold was at
[17:18.000 --> 17:20.000]  $125, it's now at $140
[17:20.000 --> 17:22.000]  you're going to hold it till 2 o'clock today
[17:22.000 --> 17:24.000]  you can't do it till midnight right now
[17:24.000 --> 17:26.000]  at the end of the show you'll announce
[17:26.000 --> 17:28.000]  whether you can or not, you have
[17:28.000 --> 17:30.000]  Frank's, you have Sovereigns
[17:30.000 --> 17:32.000]  at the $991, $994
[17:32.000 --> 17:34.000]  level when you bought those two groups of coins
[17:34.000 --> 17:36.000]  with it now at above $1040
[17:36.000 --> 17:38.000]  you're running out of the silver
[17:38.000 --> 17:40.000]  at the 8 something level
[17:40.000 --> 17:42.000]  tell folks about that
[17:42.000 --> 17:44.000]  well I don't know, for everybody who listened to the show yesterday
[17:44.000 --> 17:46.000]  you can go back and take a look at
[17:46.000 --> 17:48.000]  infowars.com and see that I haven't raised the prices yet
[17:48.000 --> 17:50.000]  currently right now
[17:50.000 --> 17:52.000]  we do have the Frank's
[17:52.000 --> 17:54.000]  and we have the British Sovereigns at the same exact price
[17:54.000 --> 17:56.000]  as they were yesterday
[17:56.000 --> 17:58.000]  and the reason why they're there
[17:58.000 --> 18:00.000]  is because I bought them when the prices were down
[18:00.000 --> 18:02.000]  on that $900
[18:02.000 --> 18:04.000]  and $988
[18:04.000 --> 18:06.000]  level up to about $924
[18:06.000 --> 18:08.000]  the British Sovereign
[18:08.000 --> 18:10.000]  right now is at $288
[18:10.000 --> 18:12.000]  the Frank is at $233
[18:12.000 --> 18:14.000]  Alex I don't know why it makes a difference
[18:14.000 --> 18:16.000]  but for some reason here in October
[18:16.000 --> 18:18.000]  when all these countries are talking about getting away
[18:18.000 --> 18:20.000]  from the United States dollar
[18:20.000 --> 18:22.000]  and getting into a basket of currencies
[18:22.000 --> 18:24.000]  it's making a big difference to this market
[18:24.000 --> 18:26.000]  but it is. I mean we saw
[18:26.000 --> 18:28.000]  a gold drop down today
[18:28.000 --> 18:30.000]  correct down to $1,025
[18:30.000 --> 18:32.000]  and now it's
[18:32.000 --> 18:34.000]  shot back up to $1,041
[18:34.000 --> 18:36.000]  and today's peak today is
[18:36.000 --> 18:38.000]  $1,044
[18:38.000 --> 18:40.000]  now the previous record was
[18:40.000 --> 18:42.000]  $1,031
[18:42.000 --> 18:44.000]  $1,030.80
[18:44.000 --> 18:46.000]  so for those of you who don't know
[18:46.000 --> 18:48.000]  right now gold is at a market peak that it's never seen before
[18:48.000 --> 18:50.000]  what that also means
[18:50.000 --> 18:52.000]  is that the support level for gold is now moved up
[18:52.000 --> 18:54.000]  and when you see it correct
[18:54.000 --> 18:56.000]  we'll be lucky to see the $900
[18:56.000 --> 18:58.000]  and it will go up to
[18:58.000 --> 19:00.000]  $1,100
[19:00.000 --> 19:02.000]  and then it will correct to $1,000
[19:02.000 --> 19:04.000]  then correct to $1,050
[19:04.000 --> 19:06.000]  then go up to $1,400
[19:06.000 --> 19:08.000]  correct down to $1,200
[19:08.000 --> 19:10.000]  that's what all the market experts are saying
[19:10.000 --> 19:12.000]  all I know is it's not fiat
[19:12.000 --> 19:14.000]  they can't completely devalue it
[19:14.000 --> 19:16.000]  it's the safest bet it's the best investment
[19:16.000 --> 19:18.000]  since 2001 more than tripling Ted
[19:18.000 --> 19:20.000]  it sure is it has been just
[19:20.000 --> 19:22.000]  solid and safe for over 6,000 years
[19:22.000 --> 19:24.000]  and it's not surprising to me
[19:24.000 --> 19:26.000]  to see it do incredibly well
[19:26.000 --> 19:28.000]  well Ted I want to hold you over for one more segment
[19:28.000 --> 19:30.000]  to talk about what we're seeing with the foreigners
[19:30.000 --> 19:32.000]  and what a dollar implosion
[19:32.000 --> 19:34.000]  or devaluation will mean what it will look like
[19:34.000 --> 19:36.000]  but listen he can hold it till the end of the show today
[19:36.000 --> 19:38.000]  800-686-2237
[19:38.000 --> 19:40.000]  he can hold
[19:40.000 --> 19:42.000]  gold that he bought at the 991
[19:42.000 --> 19:44.000]  to 995 level
[19:44.000 --> 19:46.000]  until 2 today you cannot find this deal
[19:46.000 --> 19:48.000]  anywhere most people can't even get
[19:48.000 --> 19:50.000]  gold right now it's selling out
[19:50.000 --> 19:52.000]  800-686-2237
[19:52.000 --> 19:54.000]  take advantage of this deal
[19:54.000 --> 19:56.000]  don't be a fool
[19:56.000 --> 19:58.000]  800-686-2237
[19:58.000 --> 20:00.000]  Ted Anderson stay with us
[20:28.000 --> 20:30.000]  bigburkeywaterfilters.com
[20:58.000 --> 21:00.000]  Gold isn't for you
[21:00.000 --> 21:02.000]  Ted Anderson president of Midas Resources
[21:02.000 --> 21:04.000]  one of the world's premier gold
[21:04.000 --> 21:06.000]  and precious metal investing firms
[21:06.000 --> 21:08.000]  I get it you wouldn't buy gold
[21:08.000 --> 21:10.000]  if you believed that the government
[21:10.000 --> 21:12.000]  is doing a great job
[21:12.000 --> 21:14.000]  that the fed will stop handing out trillions of dollars
[21:14.000 --> 21:16.000]  like bailout candy
[21:16.000 --> 21:18.000]  that social security would be there for you
[21:18.000 --> 21:20.000]  that's not what's happening
[21:20.000 --> 21:22.000]  you might even pass on gold
[21:22.000 --> 21:24.000]  if the stimulus package wouldn't fuel inflation
[21:24.000 --> 21:26.000]  or that the dollar wouldn't lose value
[21:26.000 --> 21:28.000]  your retirement would be secure
[21:28.000 --> 21:30.000]  if all looks rosy to you
[21:30.000 --> 21:32.000]  then now is not the time to buy gold
[21:32.000 --> 21:34.000]  for the realists there have never been
[21:34.000 --> 21:36.000]  more sobering reasons to diversify with gold
[21:36.000 --> 21:38.000]  since 2001 the US dollar index
[21:38.000 --> 21:40.000]  has tanked 30% while gold
[21:40.000 --> 21:42.000]  has risen 300%
[21:42.000 --> 21:44.000]  right now savvy investors are adding gold
[21:44.000 --> 21:46.000]  to their portfolios
[21:46.000 --> 21:48.000]  you should too find out what they know
[21:48.000 --> 21:50.000]  call us and I'll send you 10 reasons
[21:50.000 --> 21:52.000]  why gold will do very well free

[21:54.000 --> 21:56.000]  that's 800-686-2237

[24:46.880 --> 24:53.080]  That's falloftherepublic.com, a premiere there at prisonplanet.tv and falloftherepublic.com.
[24:53.080 --> 24:55.840]  So you get an idea of the type of quality.
[24:55.840 --> 24:59.800]  This is just the medium quality that members will be seeing at prisonplanet.tv with the
[24:59.800 --> 25:04.080]  October 21st premiere online at prisonplanet.tv.
[25:04.080 --> 25:08.000]  And Mike Rivera is coming up, then we got William Lewis and Gary Franchi getting their
[25:08.000 --> 25:12.140]  take on the hardened Montana situation, the militarization of police, how this ties in
[25:12.140 --> 25:17.120]  with their film Camp FEMA, this archipelago of private prisons, government prisons, and
[25:17.120 --> 25:21.280]  designated sites, black sites, ghost sites.
[25:21.280 --> 25:23.960]  So that is coming up today as well.
[25:23.960 --> 25:27.920]  And open phones, got a lot of very serious second amendment news as well.
[25:27.920 --> 25:34.520]  But going back to Ted Anderson, Ted, the constant drumbeat at G20 and constant drum and Geithner
[25:34.520 --> 25:38.000]  admitting, yeah, we're looking at phasing out the dollar as the World Reserve currency
[25:38.000 --> 25:40.080]  going directly to SDRs.
[25:40.080 --> 25:44.360]  People keep saying, well, will I see a new red money or blue money or, you know, will
[25:44.360 --> 25:46.920]  we see some new new World Order money?
[25:46.920 --> 25:47.920]  No.
[25:47.920 --> 25:52.320]  A private bank of the world that funds itself through carbon taxes and money transfer, Tobin
[25:52.320 --> 25:55.000]  taxes and well-head taxes.
[25:55.000 --> 26:00.480]  This has openly been announced every day it's in the financial publications for years.
[26:00.480 --> 26:04.840]  That is going to fund the private shareholders of the private U.S. Federal Reserve that owns
[26:04.840 --> 26:07.280]  the private bank of England, the private banks in Europe.
[26:07.280 --> 26:08.880]  It's the same group on record.
[26:08.880 --> 26:11.160]  We will now pay taxes directly to them.
[26:11.160 --> 26:16.160]  They will set the global currency rates and insider trade on that to wreck economies and
[26:16.160 --> 26:17.160]  consolidate them.
[26:17.160 --> 26:19.720]  This is all a consolidation mafia move.
[26:19.720 --> 26:22.840]  It's all loan sharking, 30% interest rates.
[26:22.840 --> 26:27.680]  Soon as they get you in debt, they double the interest rates from 15 to 30 loan sharking.
[26:27.680 --> 26:29.320]  And this is about a vertical integration.
[26:29.320 --> 26:35.640]  That's why they're calling it an economy that's in a boom now, that's out of the recession.
[26:35.640 --> 26:39.480]  But oh, in the new recession, we have 10% unemployment and that's their cook numbers.
[26:39.480 --> 26:41.640]  It's more like 20.
[26:41.640 --> 26:42.640]  But the banks do well.
[26:42.640 --> 26:47.240]  I mean, I was watching CNBC this morning as they were explaining, this is the new economy.
[26:47.240 --> 26:51.120]  And so you have a bank of the world that bankrupts the planet by design.
[26:51.120 --> 26:53.240]  You pay all your taxes to them.
[26:53.240 --> 26:56.560]  They control the world, different currencies at the region level.
[26:56.560 --> 27:02.040]  And then they have SDRs, bank to bank, that are just fiat and they create unlimited amounts
[27:02.040 --> 27:07.720]  of money and bypass governments even issuing T-bills.
[27:07.720 --> 27:11.360]  I mean, Ted Anderson, this is so diabolical.
[27:11.360 --> 27:16.080]  This is like a con artist like Michael Hilton taking over the town of Hardin.
[27:16.080 --> 27:20.280]  And it's con artist banking families just take over the world and say, we control the
[27:20.280 --> 27:21.280]  money.
[27:21.280 --> 27:25.000]  Everybody bows down and the stormtroopers march out Billy clubbing the public.
[27:25.000 --> 27:29.280]  Well, Alex, what I have to say right now is I wish I could prove you wrong, but you're
[27:29.280 --> 27:31.040]  absolutely right on.
[27:31.040 --> 27:33.440]  That's the whole sadness over this whole thing.
[27:33.440 --> 27:38.560]  The only glimmer of hope and light to this is, is that the people are start getting,
[27:38.560 --> 27:41.080]  they're getting smart and they're waking up to it.
[27:41.080 --> 27:45.080]  Unfortunately, they're still in the minority and we need more people to be able to stand
[27:45.080 --> 27:46.880]  up against this tyranny.
[27:46.880 --> 27:51.840]  But you know, Alex, I just have to say, if you're sitting there with money, that's,
[27:51.840 --> 27:55.680]  you know, I mean, in the stock market, in the bond market, in you know, it is, I mean,
[27:55.680 --> 28:00.080]  you name it, if it's dollar denominated value, you're going to lose purchasing power.
[28:00.080 --> 28:04.960]  The market itself is going to make you want to trade this foreign currency because of
[28:04.960 --> 28:05.960]  the currency that you have.
[28:05.960 --> 28:07.440]  Well, I agree with you, Ted.
[28:07.440 --> 28:08.440]  Not trustworthy.
[28:08.440 --> 28:10.160]  And, and, and I agree with you.
[28:10.160 --> 28:12.280]  And Bob Chapman has been right about every major announcement.
[28:12.280 --> 28:17.080]  He said over a year ago, he said in the summer, they'd run the market back up and then sometime
[28:17.080 --> 28:21.880]  in the fall or winter, plunge it even further this time, then they'll jack it back up again.
[28:21.880 --> 28:28.360]  And it's meant to sucker in the non-institutional investors and cull off the middle class's
[28:28.360 --> 28:29.360]  money.
[28:29.360 --> 28:33.560]  And I just watched these yuppies just waiting to be raped even harder and they just will
[28:33.560 --> 28:34.960]  not buy silver and gold.
[28:34.960 --> 28:36.760]  They do not want profits.
[28:36.760 --> 28:40.680]  Well, you know, I think it's just a matter of being brainwashed into the fact that the
[28:40.680 --> 28:43.280]  status quo is the way to do things.
[28:43.280 --> 28:46.240]  There is a, there is a group of people now that are buying gold.
[28:46.240 --> 28:50.600]  I was real surprised today to see that a lot of people wanted to buy and take advantage
[28:50.600 --> 28:52.280]  of yesterday's prices.
[28:52.280 --> 28:57.360]  I, I have to say that, you know, it's simply, you're not going to be able to buy gold at
[28:57.360 --> 29:01.000]  the prices that I haven't posted that right now in the future.
[29:01.000 --> 29:02.720]  Certainly not if gold is going to hold that.
[29:02.720 --> 29:06.560]  And by the way folks, this isn't a game where you call and they say they're out.
[29:06.560 --> 29:10.280]  Ted's lost a lot of money before because he, as long as he says he's extending and he's
[29:10.280 --> 29:16.600]  extending it, you really can buy gold that was in the market at the 991 to 995.
[29:16.600 --> 29:24.040]  When it's nine thousand, when it's 1041 right now, all time record, $10 above any previous
[29:24.040 --> 29:25.040]  record.
[29:25.040 --> 29:31.240]  Ladies and gentlemen, 800-686-2237-800-686-2237.
[29:31.240 --> 29:32.240]  Take advantage.
[29:32.240 --> 29:35.040]  Ted can hold it till two o'clock today at the very end of the show.
[29:35.040 --> 29:36.960]  He'll give us an update.
[29:36.960 --> 29:38.920]  800-686-2237.
[29:38.920 --> 29:42.040]  You've got to tell him you heard it on this radio show or it's going to be the higher
[29:42.040 --> 29:43.040]  price.
[29:43.040 --> 29:44.040]  It's still a great deal.
[29:44.040 --> 29:45.040]  Thank you so much, Ted.
[29:45.040 --> 29:46.040]  Yeah.
[29:46.040 --> 29:47.040]  Thanks for having me up, Alex.
[29:47.040 --> 29:51.120]  They got the half dollars in silver, they got the gold francs and the sovereigns.
[29:51.120 --> 29:52.400]  We're on the march.
[29:52.400 --> 29:54.800]  The empire's on the run.
[29:54.800 --> 29:58.920]  Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[29:58.920 --> 30:03.920]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[30:03.920 --> 30:08.280]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition
[30:08.280 --> 30:09.280]  do you want?
[30:09.280 --> 30:11.320]  My answer would be all I can get.
[30:11.320 --> 30:16.320]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[30:16.320 --> 30:17.560]  How much do you want?
[30:17.560 --> 30:18.560]  When do you want it?
[30:18.560 --> 30:20.600]  Now or after the battle starts?
[30:20.600 --> 30:21.720]  When will you need it?
[30:21.720 --> 30:23.840]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[30:23.840 --> 30:25.200]  Will there be any food?
[30:25.200 --> 30:26.640]  Will it make your children sick?
[30:26.640 --> 30:30.760]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center
[30:30.760 --> 30:31.960]  and be immunized?
[30:31.960 --> 30:35.720]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[30:35.720 --> 30:39.280]  It is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[30:39.280 --> 30:40.520]  How much will you need?
[30:40.520 --> 30:41.520]  We don't know.
[30:41.520 --> 30:42.520]  How much do you want?
[30:42.520 --> 30:43.520]  All you can get.
[30:43.520 --> 30:44.520]  I'm Alex Jones.
[30:44.520 --> 30:47.560]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[30:47.560 --> 30:55.000]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at eFoodsDirect.com.
[30:55.000 --> 31:01.360]  Again, that number, 1-800-409-5633.
[31:01.360 --> 31:07.440]  In the New World Order's War Against Humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[31:07.440 --> 31:11.960]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of
[31:11.960 --> 31:13.280]  us would like to see.
[31:13.280 --> 31:18.440]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest
[31:18.440 --> 31:19.840]  of the American people.
[31:19.840 --> 31:24.200]  While Obama's already fudging, he's fudged since day one in this election.
[31:24.200 --> 31:29.320]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing
[31:29.320 --> 31:37.440]  the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[31:37.440 --> 31:39.120]  It's not about left to right.
[31:39.120 --> 31:41.000]  It's about a one-world government.
[31:41.000 --> 31:47.920]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[31:47.920 --> 31:54.040]  Get your copy of the Obama deception today at infowars.com or download it at superhighquality
[31:54.040 --> 32:01.440]  at prisonplanet.tv, the Obama deception, the people strike back.
[32:01.440 --> 32:06.760]  Most people know that drinking pure high alkaline pH water is the most important factor in maintaining
[32:06.760 --> 32:09.000]  high energy and vibrant health.
[32:09.000 --> 32:13.240]  Most experts agree that the water you drink should be at a pH level of 8 or higher.
[32:13.240 --> 32:18.600]  Halcovision plasma pH drops combine a unique formula of the most alkaline minerals.
[32:18.600 --> 32:23.640]  Using plasma pH drops is the best way to make your water alkaline to help you get rid of
[32:23.640 --> 32:26.160]  acid and regain your health and energy.
[32:26.160 --> 32:31.040]  Simply put 10 drops in the water you drink to raise the pH to a healthy level.
[32:31.040 --> 32:35.600]  Alkalizing water helps your body rid itself of acidic waste and increases the oxygen content
[32:35.600 --> 32:36.920]  of your body.
[32:36.920 --> 32:42.640]  Disease organisms like bacteria, viruses and cancer cannot survive in an alkaline high pH
[32:42.640 --> 32:43.640]  environment.
[32:43.640 --> 32:49.200]  Order your bottle of alcovision plasma pH drops now by going directly to alcovision.com.
[32:49.200 --> 33:14.200]  Or call 269-409-1776, 269-409-1776 today.
[33:14.200 --> 33:19.720]  I want to go over and detail what's happening in the economy and the preparation to decapitate
[33:19.720 --> 33:24.640]  the dollar to make way for the world government and what that's going to mean when we lose
[33:24.640 --> 33:25.640]  the dollar.
[33:25.640 --> 33:30.120]  A lot of these arrogant yuppies have no idea what that even means, they're going to find
[33:30.120 --> 33:33.120]  out real fast.
[33:33.120 --> 33:37.520]  We also have all this police state news, hard Montana, big developments there, the biggest
[33:37.520 --> 33:43.560]  yet, but Barack Obama is continuing every Bush policy just with a little bit different
[33:43.560 --> 33:44.560]  rhetoric.
[33:44.560 --> 33:47.960]  But right now he's giving a speech announcing that the fusion centers, when you hear the
[33:47.960 --> 33:54.160]  term fusion center, that means total federalization of your local county and city, total dictatorship.
[33:54.160 --> 33:58.560]  When you hear a fusion center, that means the feds coming in and saying no protests,
[33:58.560 --> 34:03.120]  no demonstration, no gathering, more than one person in any place, we're going to break
[34:03.120 --> 34:06.320]  a building club over your head when you come out of a store, we're going to have police
[34:06.320 --> 34:08.720]  dogs attack all women.
[34:08.720 --> 34:12.560]  That means the regular army and National Guard running your local police department
[34:12.560 --> 34:15.000]  and the computer systems, the feds put in.
[34:15.000 --> 34:18.720]  And he's announcing that, he's announcing Al Qaeda is about to hit us and he's doing
[34:18.720 --> 34:22.800]  the best he can to keep us safe, which means they're getting ready to stage some terror
[34:22.800 --> 34:23.800]  attacks.
[34:23.800 --> 34:28.440]  His approval rating has now dropped down to 40 points, lowest of any president, 11 months
[34:28.440 --> 34:34.480]  into his first administration, 10 and a half months into his first administration.
[34:34.480 --> 34:38.920]  And let's go ahead and fade up the dictator in chief, oh he's gone, he's done with his
[34:38.920 --> 34:39.920]  speech.
[34:39.920 --> 34:43.280]  There are some articles here and we'll, we'll play some chilling clips of it.
[34:43.280 --> 34:48.320]  Fusion framework and fusion core solution, Microsoft paid for all of this.
[34:48.320 --> 34:52.360]  The face scanning cameras, the license plate reading cameras, the federal software built
[34:52.360 --> 34:57.120]  into all the phones by federal law to track where your cell phone goes down to just three
[34:57.120 --> 35:03.520]  feet, the body scanners, the systems tracking you, the fake databases, putting your name
[35:03.520 --> 35:07.560]  on databases as a terrorist if you have bad credit.
[35:07.560 --> 35:14.640]  This is their sickening control grid, ladies and gentlemen.
[35:14.640 --> 35:19.400]  And Obama is running around giving his speech on that front.
[35:19.400 --> 35:27.720]  We are going to have the world premiere of the big trailer for fall of republic and this
[35:27.720 --> 35:31.320]  is the fall of the republic, the birth of world government, the birth of the new world
[35:31.320 --> 35:33.800]  order and the rise of the resistance.
[35:33.800 --> 35:36.440]  Yes, it's the fall of the republic.
[35:36.440 --> 35:39.440]  This just admit the republic's been taken over by offshore banks.
[35:39.440 --> 35:41.440]  They've abolished the bill of rights.
[35:41.440 --> 35:44.200]  They're operating 110% to set the president.
[35:44.200 --> 35:45.560]  There is no bill of rights.
[35:45.560 --> 35:51.440]  There is no constitution.
[35:51.440 --> 35:54.980]  They are doing it.
[35:54.980 --> 35:58.560]  Right now, ladies and gentlemen, they are taking over our society right now.
[35:58.560 --> 36:02.680]  This is really happening.
[36:02.680 --> 36:08.360]  And notice they've got the other federalization smoke screen.
[36:08.360 --> 36:14.120]  And notice Obama is the first president to run the United Nations Security Council, which
[36:14.120 --> 36:18.520]  they've admitted on CNN, has all the power in the UN, the General Assembly.
[36:18.520 --> 36:24.120]  When they introduced him as the chairman of the Security Council, the 15-member board,
[36:24.120 --> 36:30.640]  CNN's Wolf Blitzer said the only position with any power in the UN, the UN is a dictatorship.
[36:30.640 --> 36:33.000]  It's designed to look like it's all free and happy.
[36:33.000 --> 36:40.000]  You look at the 31 articles of the UN Declaration of Human Rights.
[36:40.000 --> 36:45.080]  The first 28 give you all these wonderful great rights, but it says the government gives
[36:45.080 --> 36:46.080]  them to you.
[36:46.080 --> 36:51.760]  You don't innately have them as a free sentient being in the galaxy, in the universe.
[36:51.760 --> 36:53.000]  No.
[36:53.000 --> 36:57.600]  You get it from the UN, and then article 30 and 31, they say, we can revoke these at
[36:57.600 --> 37:01.200]  any time if the UN wants to in their privileges.
[37:01.200 --> 37:04.000]  And we can arrest you and shut down your free speech.
[37:04.000 --> 37:10.280]  Notice this week, actually less Friday, they announced that the Internet that the US designed
[37:10.280 --> 37:18.160]  and built and that the ICANN naming and numbering system was handed over to a private corporation
[37:18.160 --> 37:21.520]  completely that's under UN control.
[37:21.520 --> 37:22.800]  Everything's being transferred.
[37:22.800 --> 37:24.920]  The president's now the UN head.
[37:24.920 --> 37:26.640]  He swears allegiance to it.
[37:26.640 --> 37:28.960]  The Internet's handed over to the UN.
[37:28.960 --> 37:34.160]  They announced that they're going to be shutting down the dollar in the next two years incrementally
[37:34.160 --> 37:40.280]  so we don't riot because if they dropped you flat on your face, you'd get really angry.
[37:40.280 --> 37:44.680]  If suddenly two thirds of your buying power on top of the depression hits you, you'd freak
[37:44.680 --> 37:45.680]  out.
[37:45.680 --> 37:46.680]  No, no, no.
[37:46.680 --> 37:48.400]  This is going to be done slowly.
[37:48.400 --> 37:52.240]  They're going to lovingly push you under the water and just pet your hair as you suck
[37:52.240 --> 37:57.360]  water into your lungs, oh, and they'll have smiling faces reading off teleprompters info
[37:57.360 --> 38:03.280]  babes smiling lovingly at you and with them in a motherly way, smacking their lips with
[38:03.280 --> 38:06.000]  a glistening lipstick.
[38:06.000 --> 38:16.000]  We're your friends and all the yuppies and morons will smile back.
[38:16.000 --> 38:17.320]  This is the new world order.
[38:17.320 --> 38:20.040]  It's happening right now.
[38:20.040 --> 38:23.560]  Mike Rivera was coming up, we're going to go into the flu.
[38:23.560 --> 38:28.680]  On the flu front, again, it's like I'm watching the Twilight Zone or something.
[38:28.680 --> 38:30.080]  I'm in the Twilight Zone.
[38:30.080 --> 38:34.760]  I watch CNN, I watch Fox and Shepherd Smith says it's a conspiracy theory.
[38:34.760 --> 38:39.680]  There are no adverse reactions, no side effects, none of the flu shots seasonal or H1N1 can
[38:39.680 --> 38:40.680]  hurt you.
[38:40.680 --> 38:42.680]  It is a lie.
[38:42.680 --> 38:46.000]  Then he cuts because it's double think it's psych warfare.
[38:46.000 --> 38:47.000]  Everything's fine.
[38:47.000 --> 38:48.000]  Then they still warn you.
[38:48.000 --> 38:51.080]  They cut to a doctor on the same show and I saw it yesterday morning.
[38:51.080 --> 38:54.800]  We taped this on Shepherd Smith at like four or five whenever it's on during the day.
[38:54.800 --> 38:55.800]  Later it was the same thing.
[38:55.800 --> 39:02.040]  They go, oh, yes, it can cause Gilean or Guillain beret or however you pronounce it.
[39:02.040 --> 39:03.560]  Neurological disorders.
[39:03.560 --> 39:08.440]  It can cause horrible autoimmune responses.
[39:08.440 --> 39:10.080]  It can kill you.
[39:10.080 --> 39:11.480]  It's got mercury in it.
[39:11.480 --> 39:17.080]  It's got live virus in the first 10 million dosages are live virus nasal spray for those
[39:17.080 --> 39:19.920]  two years old and up.
[39:19.920 --> 39:28.200]  And then I've got the official printouts on the seasonal and the new vaccine.
[39:28.200 --> 39:33.520]  The seasonal has the H1N1 that did a double take double cross on us.
[39:33.520 --> 39:38.480]  They admit that it's got the mercury and the adjuvant Senate.
[39:38.480 --> 39:43.840]  They admit it's live and that it breeds the virus in the nasal passage and that it's
[39:43.840 --> 39:45.400]  going to spread it everywhere.
[39:45.400 --> 39:53.760]  I mean, I have mainstream news and the Mayo Clinic admitting all this and they admitted
[39:53.760 --> 39:54.960]  on Fox.
[39:54.960 --> 39:56.200]  They go, none of this is true.
[39:56.200 --> 39:57.200]  It doesn't exist.
[39:57.200 --> 39:58.200]  It's totally fine.
[39:58.200 --> 39:59.520]  Kind of like drug ads go.
[39:59.520 --> 40:02.840]  It's wonderful and makes you happy and will make you skip through fields of daisies and
[40:02.840 --> 40:03.840]  everything will be wonderful.
[40:03.840 --> 40:06.840]  But it can also cause heart attack, brain damage, death, cancer, blah, blah, blah.
[40:06.840 --> 40:12.440]  You know, in the last 10 seconds of the ad, like it's a auctioneer rapid fire reading
[40:12.440 --> 40:13.960]  what it makes you do.
[40:13.960 --> 40:15.160]  Do you have restless leg syndrome?
[40:15.160 --> 40:19.240]  Well, it can make you, you know, have a blood clot or make you go crazy or make you become
[40:19.240 --> 40:25.960]  a sex maniac or a gambling addict, but it doesn't actually say that for that drug.
[40:25.960 --> 40:35.960]  And it's just a public who's got learned helplessness just bathed absolutely bathed
[40:35.960 --> 40:45.400]  in total and complete 110% tyranny.
[40:45.400 --> 40:50.120]  I'm going to open the phones up right now.
[40:50.120 --> 40:53.880]  For people that want to talk about any of this craziness, the open killing of the dollar,
[40:53.880 --> 40:59.560]  the butchering of it, the, the, the gang stabbing of the Julius Caesar of currencies.
[40:59.560 --> 41:05.280]  I mean, they're in the Senate right now all taking part, stabbing it, blood splattering.
[41:05.280 --> 41:10.560]  The uppies are walking around talking about Brett Favre and David Letterman and okay,
[41:10.560 --> 41:11.560]  great.
[41:11.560 --> 41:12.560]  Talk about it.
[41:12.560 --> 41:13.560]  Enjoy it.
[41:13.560 --> 41:18.080]  But when you're homeless, lined up at the FEMA center, I mean, have you noticed this
[41:18.080 --> 41:24.480]  whole police state is happening right now as they implode the dollar as they bring in
[41:24.480 --> 41:25.480]  the tyranny?
[41:25.480 --> 41:28.680]  Obama's on TV announcing, don't worry, the feds are taking over.
[41:28.680 --> 41:29.680]  Don't worry.
[41:29.680 --> 41:30.680]  Al-Qaeda is about to hit.
[41:30.680 --> 41:31.680]  We'll keep you safe.
[41:31.680 --> 41:32.680]  Give up all your rights.
[41:32.680 --> 41:36.600]  This is the actual DHS reports and they say the whole thing set up for gun owners, veterans
[41:36.600 --> 41:40.680]  and people that don't like the Federal Reserve because it's coming out that that's who rules
[41:40.680 --> 41:41.680]  us.
[41:41.680 --> 41:46.120]  That's the government, the offshore bankers that engineered all this and instead of us
[41:46.120 --> 41:52.320]  just waking up and saying no and having grand juries indict this group of Madoff's and,
[41:52.320 --> 41:54.160]  and, and, and Ken Lay Enron types.
[41:54.160 --> 41:56.160]  It's literally who runs it all.
[41:56.160 --> 41:58.400]  Bunch of criminals bigger than them.
[41:58.400 --> 42:02.520]  Instead of them going to jail and us fixing our economy and all this stopping, no, it's
[42:02.520 --> 42:08.040]  just like Harden Montana where it's a convicted 14-time felon scam artist lying about everything.
[42:08.040 --> 42:11.360]  They still say, well, we're going to try to redo the contract with him because we can't
[42:11.360 --> 42:14.800]  say we're wrong if that's all this is.
[42:14.800 --> 42:19.600]  And so there's going to be death camps and FEMA camps and, and tattletale squads in total
[42:19.600 --> 42:24.760]  control because people cannot and will not wake up and they will not admit they've been
[42:24.760 --> 42:27.360]  caught.
[42:27.360 --> 42:31.360]  And so the bankers are going to openly run up their flag in the country, have us pay taxes
[42:31.360 --> 42:32.360]  to them.
[42:32.360 --> 42:33.480]  They're going to arrest people.
[42:33.480 --> 42:35.120]  Political dissidents are going to disappear.
[42:35.120 --> 42:36.240]  The cops love it.
[42:36.240 --> 42:42.480]  The cops everywhere openly announced no free speech, no protest allowed in DC at the G20.
[42:42.480 --> 42:43.920]  They don't even issue permits.
[42:43.920 --> 42:45.520]  They turn a right into a privilege.
[42:45.520 --> 42:48.520]  They're going to go after our guns.
[42:48.520 --> 42:53.400]  They're going to shut down farms and ranches and homeschooling and it's all happening.
[42:53.400 --> 42:56.600]  And the kids are going to be wearing arm bands and marching in the streets.
[42:56.600 --> 42:57.880]  It's already happening.
[42:57.880 --> 42:59.480]  They're doing military drills.
[42:59.480 --> 43:03.840]  I've seen the, the city ear people in their uniforms in Austin.
[43:03.840 --> 43:06.800]  I mean, it, it girl scouts being trained and spy on everybody.
[43:06.800 --> 43:07.800]  Boy scouts.
[43:07.800 --> 43:10.160]  I mean, this is hell.
[43:10.160 --> 43:11.660]  This is hell.
[43:11.660 --> 43:16.000]  I mean, it's really what happened in the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany is going to happen
[43:16.000 --> 43:17.160]  here.
[43:17.160 --> 43:21.680]  Just like it happens everywhere else and it's going to happen bigger and better in America.
[43:21.680 --> 43:25.360]  And they got a bunch of control freaks who think they're God who wear a badge and have
[43:25.360 --> 43:29.880]  a gun and a bunch of sicko prosecutors that have built giant prisons all over their towns
[43:29.880 --> 43:31.200]  and they move up the chain.
[43:31.200 --> 43:37.360]  If they build more prisons and fill them and they're going to fill them.
[43:37.360 --> 43:47.000]  I've got one here out of London telegraph where it says to police, this is BBC review
[43:47.000 --> 43:49.320]  a babysitting ban ordered.
[43:49.320 --> 43:53.560]  It says even two groups of police officers aren't allowed to watch each other's kids
[43:53.560 --> 43:54.560]  on the weekend.
[43:54.560 --> 43:57.080]  Even the cops are slaves.
[43:57.080 --> 43:58.680]  That's how this works.
[43:58.680 --> 44:00.720]  I mean, it's just total hell being released.
[44:00.720 --> 44:01.720]  Okay.
[44:01.720 --> 44:02.720]  I'm going to take some calls at 1-800-259-9231.
[44:02.720 --> 44:03.720]  We're going to move quickly.
[44:03.720 --> 44:04.720]  Tim in Texas.
[44:04.720 --> 44:05.720]  You're on the air.
[44:05.720 --> 44:06.720]  Alex.
[44:06.720 --> 44:07.720]  Love your show.
[44:07.720 --> 44:17.720]  Like your take on why this Michael Moore capitalism movie is so popular and I've read
[44:17.720 --> 44:19.520]  an article about that.
[44:19.520 --> 44:20.520]  That's all hype.
[44:20.520 --> 44:21.760]  It's his greatest failure.
[44:21.760 --> 44:28.080]  It's the lowest grossing documentary he's ever released, Bowling for Columbine, Sicko,
[44:28.080 --> 44:30.320]  Fahrenheit 9-11.
[44:30.320 --> 44:36.280]  It's a giant failure and again, they're blaming capitalism.
[44:36.280 --> 44:37.480]  This isn't capitalism.
[44:37.480 --> 44:39.160]  This is corporate communism.
[44:39.160 --> 44:40.480]  This is robbery.
[44:40.480 --> 44:41.480]  This is piracy.
[44:41.480 --> 44:48.240]  But they have to blame the free market because now they're bringing in the global tyranny.
[44:48.240 --> 44:55.720]  Why does he get all this attention in the news and your documentaries, which are fantastic,
[44:55.720 --> 44:59.040]  get absolutely very little attention in the news media?
[44:59.040 --> 45:02.600]  I don't understand that.
[45:02.600 --> 45:06.000]  Because Michael Moore reaffirms the left-right paradigm.
[45:06.000 --> 45:08.320]  He makes the left good, the right bad.
[45:08.320 --> 45:12.120]  He divides the people instead of going, hey, left and right are both owned by the soft
[45:12.120 --> 45:13.120]  shore bank.
[45:13.120 --> 45:17.920]  See, we're like rats in a maze and they've done university studies on this.
[45:17.920 --> 45:25.280]  Where there's big contained mazes that have hundreds and hundreds of square feet.
[45:25.280 --> 45:27.800]  There's different layers, different levels.
[45:27.800 --> 45:29.240]  The rats overproduce.
[45:29.240 --> 45:30.680]  They have wars.
[45:30.680 --> 45:36.560]  They never know that they can get out of there.
[45:36.560 --> 45:41.840]  And generations go on inside these mazes that have artificial light in them and that's the
[45:41.840 --> 45:43.720]  end of it.
[45:43.720 --> 45:44.720]  And it's the same thing.
[45:44.720 --> 45:49.640]  You live in this artificial matrix of false political ideas and everything is about making
[45:49.640 --> 45:51.920]  you believe the president really has the power.
[45:51.920 --> 45:55.800]  And the president's really doing it and oh, the president's fighting with the Pentagon
[45:55.800 --> 45:57.480]  as if he runs anything.
[45:57.480 --> 46:02.120]  It's all for outward consumption, but you're right.
[46:02.120 --> 46:06.000]  The way the media behaves, this is the most hype ever seen for one of his movies.
[46:06.000 --> 46:13.240]  Blaming capitalism, it's a private group of banks, of hucksters, of con men.
[46:13.240 --> 46:19.920]  It's not free market.
[46:19.920 --> 46:25.880]  I tell people about your documentaries, Alex, and especially recently, and I get this feedback
[46:25.880 --> 46:32.520]  from people about that I watched the new Michael Moore show and they just are clueless about
[46:32.520 --> 46:34.640]  what's really happening.
[46:34.640 --> 46:41.960]  And I come from out of left field in their little world and they don't hardly understand
[46:41.960 --> 46:43.960]  it.
[46:43.960 --> 46:48.200]  Well, Germans didn't know Hitler was bad in 38, but they knew by 40.
[46:48.200 --> 46:49.760]  And so just keep planting the seeds.
[46:49.760 --> 46:55.800]  I appreciate your call and just explain to them that Obama is the same as Bush, keeping
[46:55.800 --> 47:01.040]  the Patriot Act, expanding secret arrest, hiring nothing but lobbyists, expanding wars.
[47:01.040 --> 47:05.840]  Then they have the Pentagon come in and criticize him for not expanding it enough.
[47:05.840 --> 47:07.280]  That gives him left cover.
[47:07.280 --> 47:10.120]  It's a simple con game.
[47:10.120 --> 47:13.840]  Looks like when you're at the carnival and one carny goes, Hey, buddy, you look like
[47:13.840 --> 47:14.840]  a wimp.
[47:14.840 --> 47:16.720]  You're afraid to try to pitch.
[47:16.720 --> 47:18.920]  And the guy next to him goes, I don't listen to him.
[47:18.920 --> 47:19.920]  I'm your friend.
[47:19.920 --> 47:20.920]  Come on over here.
[47:20.920 --> 47:21.920]  Yeah, you're going to win at this.
[47:21.920 --> 47:25.520]  It's called good cop, bad cop.
[47:25.520 --> 47:28.800]  Let's talk to Mike in Tennessee, Mike around the year.
[47:28.800 --> 47:29.800]  Good morning, Alex.
[47:29.800 --> 47:30.800]  Hey, buddy.
[47:30.800 --> 47:36.640]  Being one of the first cities Memphis, Tennessee to receive the swine flu shots in the nasal
[47:36.640 --> 47:42.360]  mist here locally, one of the premier research hospitals, Lubaner Children's Hospital, where
[47:42.360 --> 47:45.560]  you take your kids if they're really sick.
[47:45.560 --> 47:51.320]  They had a girl on the news yesterday saying she worked in the prenatal care and she's
[47:51.320 --> 47:55.720]  so glad that she's one of the first to get the nasal spray because she's working with
[47:55.720 --> 47:58.160]  the sickest of the sick children.
[47:58.160 --> 48:02.200]  Little does she know if she sneezes, she's infecting all of these children with every
[48:02.200 --> 48:05.280]  breath.
[48:05.280 --> 48:12.240]  Even if the kids die, they'll use it and hype it and say, oh, swine flu got into the hospital.
[48:12.240 --> 48:14.560]  See how it, see how it works for them.
[48:14.560 --> 48:15.560]  Right.
[48:15.560 --> 48:16.560]  It builds into the propaganda.
[48:16.560 --> 48:20.600]  They've already had three children that and the mainstream media here, the government
[48:20.600 --> 48:24.720]  media, as I call it now, they say three children now died of the swine flu.
[48:24.720 --> 48:28.880]  And then they say the hospital says these children died of complications while they
[48:28.880 --> 48:30.040]  had the swine flu.
[48:30.040 --> 48:31.040]  So what killed them?
[48:31.040 --> 48:34.240]  The swine flu or the complications, the complications?
[48:34.240 --> 48:38.200]  Well, as you hear about Bill Gates, a caller called last week and I looked it up and confirmed
[48:38.200 --> 48:39.760]  it.
[48:39.760 --> 48:45.000]  He gives a standard speech hundreds of times a year to community groups and sometimes he
[48:45.000 --> 48:50.960]  releases mosquitoes in the audience and says, I want to put vaccines and mosquitoes and
[48:50.960 --> 48:54.200]  he tells you how great the mosquito, you know, all these vaccines are and how he loves you
[48:54.200 --> 48:57.400]  and he just so happens to be for eugenics, but that's okay.
[48:57.400 --> 48:58.540]  Trust him.
[48:58.540 --> 49:05.760]  But Bill Gates comes out and says, Oh, I thought you only need one polio shot, but the kids
[49:05.760 --> 49:08.000]  need nine to 12.
[49:08.000 --> 49:12.480]  And then you actually go look up what he's doing and you got, we've got AP on this.
[49:12.480 --> 49:22.960]  They admit, Oh, the live attenuated polio vaccine is what's giving the kids polio.
[49:22.960 --> 49:23.960]  That's confirmed.
[49:23.960 --> 49:25.680]  And see, it's the same thing with this.
[49:25.680 --> 49:28.120]  They come out with a polio vaccine.
[49:28.120 --> 49:29.720]  It kills you or makes you sick.
[49:29.720 --> 49:30.720]  They hype.
[49:30.720 --> 49:32.440]  Oh, see, we need more injections.
[49:32.440 --> 49:33.440]  It's the same thing with the flu.
[49:33.440 --> 49:35.960]  Oh, we're going to put live flu into your nasal passage.
[49:35.960 --> 49:39.200]  They admit it's going to breed it, but only in the fine print.
[49:39.200 --> 49:41.480]  Shepard Smith calls it a conspiracy theory.
[49:41.480 --> 49:42.880]  Well, you just watch.
[49:42.880 --> 49:43.880]  Yeah.
[49:43.880 --> 49:48.240]  Indiana, Tennessee, Texas are the three places they're starting the nasal sprays and watch.
[49:48.240 --> 49:52.160]  No one will be able to put two and two together when the big outbreaks happen there.
[49:52.160 --> 49:54.120]  Everyone will just love the government as usual.
[49:54.120 --> 49:58.040]  Once they inject, once they spread in your nostril, they say for 20 days, you're able
[49:58.040 --> 50:02.880]  to shed the virus because of your, well, if you sneeze or exhale, the, the particles
[50:02.880 --> 50:07.280]  can come out through your nostrils and you can put them out into the atmosphere for other
[50:07.280 --> 50:08.280]  people to breathe.
[50:08.280 --> 50:09.280]  Yeah.
[50:09.280 --> 50:10.920]  Notice, notice what they're doing.
[50:10.920 --> 50:15.000]  Right as they're about to come out with the 200 million dosages, they first go, Oh, we're
[50:15.000 --> 50:20.800]  going to do nasal live virus first in 10 million people.
[50:20.800 --> 50:23.400]  That will then, and then they admit, Oh, it will spread it.
[50:23.400 --> 50:24.880]  Because they just admit it.
[50:24.880 --> 50:26.360]  So see, there it is.
[50:26.360 --> 50:30.800]  They release it, they spread it, then they forcibly inoculate and they do it right out
[50:30.800 --> 50:31.800]  in front of everybody.
[50:31.800 --> 50:32.800]  Mike.
[50:32.800 --> 50:37.840]  I spoke to a lady real quick and I'll let you out today at work and she said that she
[50:37.840 --> 50:42.480]  gets a shot every year and she's going to be the first one to get her daughter.
[50:42.480 --> 50:44.520]  It's almost like a fashion statement.
[50:44.520 --> 50:46.120]  I want my child to be the first.
[50:46.120 --> 50:47.120]  Stay there.
[50:47.120 --> 50:48.120]  I want to talk about this with you, Mike.
[50:48.120 --> 50:49.120]  It's a cult.
[50:49.120 --> 50:53.680]  Look, the Aztecs would lead their children up to the pit to have their heart cut out
[50:53.680 --> 51:01.400]  and would be very prideful according to the Cortez who saw this as a kid being killed.

[52:19.160 --> 52:25.080]  Now as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80%

[54:08.200 --> 54:13.680]  Well, later in the next hour I'm going to go over the Mayo Clinic's own announcements.
[54:13.680 --> 54:19.880]  The inserts for the live, flu H1N1 nasal spray admitting it's live, it's supposedly been
[54:19.880 --> 54:23.480]  weakened but it can mutate and can spread it.
[54:23.480 --> 54:27.520]  And yeah, they're doing this in hospitals first, so that can be a perfect incubating
[54:27.520 --> 54:31.240]  ground in these sick hospitals, these sick buildings as they're called.
[54:31.240 --> 54:34.240]  I'm going to go back to Mike and everybody else that's holding, Mike Rivera is coming
[54:34.240 --> 54:38.760]  up and we've also got the folks from Camp Femalon, but I can only get him in this segment,
[54:38.760 --> 54:41.020]  the next he's got a meeting he's got to go to.
[54:41.020 --> 54:46.480]  On short notice, he's the Executive Director of Gun Owners of America, the Premier Second
[54:46.480 --> 54:48.680]  Amendment No Compromise Group.
[54:48.680 --> 54:52.760]  We see fights in Montana with the feds saying they can't produce their own guns there even
[54:52.760 --> 54:54.920]  though that violates the Tenth Amendment.
[54:54.920 --> 54:59.960]  We see fights for the Second Amendment in Pennsylvania, but none of those are as important
[54:59.960 --> 55:06.920]  as California wants you to biometrically thumbprint to be able to buy ammo and they're saying the
[55:06.920 --> 55:11.440]  governor should sign legislation requiring ID and thumbprint to purchase handgun ammo.
[55:11.440 --> 55:17.800]  Now, the feds want this and California is the seventh biggest economy in the world.
[55:17.800 --> 55:25.080]  It's about 25% of the U.S. economy roughly and growing and it sets precedents for cars,
[55:25.080 --> 55:29.040]  for standardization, for biometrics on guns, they've already gotten that passed.
[55:29.040 --> 55:33.000]  They're killing the gun industry and they want their slaves disarmed.
[55:33.000 --> 55:35.200]  So Larry Pratt joins us to break this down.
[55:35.200 --> 55:40.000]  The LA Times says, hey, they want you to biometrically scan to do this and the Democrats want you
[55:40.000 --> 55:45.000]  to thumb scan when you buy a hamburger or something fattening to pay a carbon footprint.
[55:45.000 --> 55:49.480]  So this is the thumb scanning to buy and sell, not just to get your ammo.
[55:49.480 --> 55:50.480]  Larry Pratt.
[55:50.480 --> 55:55.200]  Alex, you know, there's one thing they're not going to make us thumb scan on or use
[55:55.200 --> 56:01.000]  any kind of biometric or for that matter, any ID whatsoever.
[56:01.000 --> 56:02.000]  And that's when we go vote.
[56:02.000 --> 56:03.520]  I wonder why that is.
[56:03.520 --> 56:05.520]  Or when we get the free healthcare.
[56:05.520 --> 56:10.120]  When the anchor babies, people have four or five kids and get all the welfare for free,
[56:10.120 --> 56:14.000]  the average illegal sucks twice as much tax money as they ever pay, but so what?
[56:14.000 --> 56:15.000]  Yep.
[56:15.000 --> 56:21.200]  We'll all be sitting in line and if we're sitting waiting day after day for this free
[56:21.200 --> 56:26.360]  service, uh, gee, we won't even have to worry about buying ammo because we won't be going
[56:26.360 --> 56:27.360]  anywhere.
[56:27.360 --> 56:28.360]  Exactly.
[56:28.360 --> 56:33.560]  I'll tell you what, I was in California this weekend, last weekend, and I heard that for
[56:33.560 --> 56:39.320]  every person that comes into the state to live, eight are leaving.
[56:39.320 --> 56:44.200]  So they're not all goofy and some of them are getting out while they can because it's
[56:44.200 --> 56:48.160]  entirely possible that that may be the first state to go to boom.
[56:48.160 --> 56:49.160]  Just implode.
[56:49.160 --> 56:53.240]  Well, the London Guardian did an analysis and said it's already the first failed state.
[56:53.240 --> 56:58.000]  It is a, and their answer is more government, more sucking off the producers.
[56:58.000 --> 56:59.320]  It's over for California.
[56:59.320 --> 57:04.200]  There was a guy at the conference that I spoke to that came up to me and he said, I got a
[57:04.200 --> 57:11.960]  tax refund, they sent me an IOU and I said, you don't look good in blue.
[57:11.960 --> 57:15.800]  I hope you're not holding your breath waiting, but I guess that's the best we can ask for
[57:15.800 --> 57:17.440]  is like the Soviet Union.
[57:17.440 --> 57:21.520]  If the big government would just at least collapse, then we could get our country back.
[57:21.520 --> 57:23.560]  That I think is what it will take.
[57:23.560 --> 57:27.240]  Apparently they're not willing to put a zero in any of the budgets.
[57:27.240 --> 57:31.240]  They're not willing to tell the unions in the state like Obama didn't want to tell the
[57:31.240 --> 57:33.400]  unions and General Motors.
[57:33.400 --> 57:36.840]  You guys have been killing the goose that lays the golden egg.
[57:36.840 --> 57:39.040]  Why do you think business is going abroad?
[57:39.040 --> 57:41.200]  It's because of this kind of insanity.
[57:41.200 --> 57:45.000]  Well, I don't mind if California government goes abroad.
[57:45.000 --> 57:46.000]  Goodbye.
[57:46.000 --> 57:48.880]  Send it to China and China would fold real quick.
[57:48.880 --> 57:50.120]  Larry, we're going to go to break.
[57:50.120 --> 57:52.200]  We got five minutes left with you.
[57:52.200 --> 57:53.200]  But start now.
[57:53.200 --> 57:56.880]  Tell us about this draconian thumbprinting to get it to buy ammo.
[57:56.880 --> 58:02.520]  Well, it's on a bill that's on the governor's desk and he hopefully will not.
[58:02.520 --> 58:08.680]  And anybody listening who's in California should call the terminator and tell him no.
[58:08.680 --> 58:12.920]  This is a really dangerous precedent, not just for people buying ammo.
[58:12.920 --> 58:17.560]  Right now, they can still go over to Arizona, go over to Nevada, they can buy all the ammo
[58:17.560 --> 58:19.200]  they want.
[58:19.200 --> 58:26.400]  But it means that we will have set a precedent that to exercise a constitutional right, we
[58:26.400 --> 58:28.600]  have to be screened.
[58:28.600 --> 58:29.600]  That is really...
[58:29.600 --> 58:32.760]  Yeah, that's guilty until proven innocent, but it does something else.
[58:32.760 --> 58:37.120]  You know, next they're going to make it illegal not having ammo that was bought in the state.
[58:37.120 --> 58:42.360]  And then they're criminalizing non-criminal state weapons.
[58:42.360 --> 58:45.360]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[58:45.360 --> 58:50.440]  Visit GCNLive.com today.
[58:50.440 --> 58:54.280]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones, and I want each of you to ask yourself this question.
[58:54.280 --> 58:56.600]  Do you really know what's in your tap water?
[58:56.600 --> 59:02.200]  In a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor, they found that over 260 chemicals
[59:02.200 --> 59:05.240]  in pollutants are present in municipal drinking water.
[59:05.240 --> 59:09.360]  Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive, immune, and developmental
[59:09.360 --> 59:10.360]  system diseases.
[59:10.360 --> 59:12.520]  Now, what are you going to do about it?
[59:12.520 --> 59:17.280]  The Acola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator is a low-cost way to take back control of
[59:17.280 --> 59:19.040]  you and your family's drinking water.
[59:19.040 --> 59:23.760]  The Acola Blue 28 produces up to 7 gallons of water from the humidity in the atmosphere
[59:23.760 --> 59:29.200]  and uses state-of-the-art carbon filtration, reverse osmosis, and ultra-violent light sterilization
[59:29.200 --> 59:30.200]  techniques.
[59:30.200 --> 59:33.360]  That's right, clean water right from the air you breathe.
[59:33.360 --> 59:38.200]  Order today by calling 1-800-691-6043.
[59:38.200 --> 59:48.200]  That's 1-800-691-6043, or visit Acola Blue on the web at www.ecoloblu.com today.
[59:48.200 --> 59:53.200]  That's AcolaBlue.com.
[59:53.200 --> 1:00:05.200]  Waging war on corruption, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[1:00:05.200 --> 1:00:10.040]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[1:00:10.040 --> 1:00:11.040]  You want answers?
[1:00:11.040 --> 1:00:13.200]  Well, so does he.
[1:00:13.200 --> 1:00:22.480]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network, and now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[1:00:22.480 --> 1:00:26.640]  Barack Obama, his attorney general, and the rest of his criminal crew are all on record
[1:00:26.640 --> 1:00:31.640]  in federal cases and state cases, saying absolute abolition of individual ownership
[1:00:31.640 --> 1:00:32.640]  of guns.
[1:00:32.640 --> 1:00:36.080]  That's why Obama's the greatest gun salesman the United States has ever seen.
[1:00:36.080 --> 1:00:39.200]  Many gun stores, as Larry was telling me during the break, have that sign up.
[1:00:39.200 --> 1:00:41.480]  In fact, I've seen it myself by an ammo.
[1:00:41.480 --> 1:00:44.160]  Back to California, so it's on the governor's desk.
[1:00:44.160 --> 1:00:45.160]  He's waffling.
[1:00:45.160 --> 1:00:46.160]  People need to call him.
[1:00:46.160 --> 1:00:47.360]  Say, don't do this.
[1:00:47.360 --> 1:00:50.040]  Don't make us register to buy ammo.
[1:00:50.040 --> 1:00:52.240]  Don't make us slaves.
[1:00:52.240 --> 1:00:55.600]  Coming up with that, Larry, in the last four minutes, we've got here other gun battles
[1:00:55.600 --> 1:00:56.600]  going on.
[1:00:56.600 --> 1:01:01.920]  Well, you've mentioned a primary one in my mind, and that's Montana, and I'm sure it
[1:01:01.920 --> 1:01:05.960]  will be soon in Tennessee as well.
[1:01:05.960 --> 1:01:13.400]  Montana, a lawsuit has been actually filed against the reaction of the Bureau of Alcohol,
[1:01:13.400 --> 1:01:17.520]  Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives, a.k.a. the gang.
[1:01:17.520 --> 1:01:25.360]  They sent a letter to all the registered firearms manufacturers and dealers in the state of Montana
[1:01:25.360 --> 1:01:32.800]  and Tennessee saying, we don't recognize your stinking state law, federal law is supreme,
[1:01:32.800 --> 1:01:35.360]  and therefore dropped it.
[1:01:35.360 --> 1:01:39.440]  Well, the answer is they've written to the wrong people.
[1:01:39.440 --> 1:01:45.400]  The people that have licenses were compelled unconstitutionally to get these licenses in
[1:01:45.400 --> 1:01:49.760]  order to go into business because they didn't have a state law to protect them.
[1:01:49.760 --> 1:01:54.920]  But the two states, Montana and Tennessee, do, and I think what's going to happen is
[1:01:54.920 --> 1:02:00.200]  they're going to lose in federal court probably most times federal court rules in favor of
[1:02:00.200 --> 1:02:06.360]  the continued unconstitutional growth of the federal government, but that doesn't end
[1:02:06.360 --> 1:02:12.200]  the matter, and it could really come down to what the sheriff is willing and able to
[1:02:12.200 --> 1:02:13.200]  do.
[1:02:13.200 --> 1:02:18.880]  I'll give you an example from just a few years ago in Franklin County, Tennessee, interestingly,
[1:02:18.880 --> 1:02:21.720]  one of the freedom states already.
[1:02:21.720 --> 1:02:28.000]  It was a fire in a barn, it was a lot of powder and ammo, fire department was out there on
[1:02:28.000 --> 1:02:34.160]  the scene, even a couple of sheriff's deputies, and four too long FBI agents come sauntering
[1:02:34.160 --> 1:02:38.200]  on the property and announced that they're there to take over the investigation, and
[1:02:38.200 --> 1:02:40.320]  the deputies said, what investigation?
[1:02:40.320 --> 1:02:44.200]  Well, yeah, there's ammo involved, so we're here to take over the investigation.
[1:02:44.200 --> 1:02:49.120]  So they called their boss, because they knew the sheriff wasn't a real fan of federal agents.
[1:02:49.120 --> 1:02:52.960]  He came right out, found out that, yep, that's what these guys were doing, and said, well,
[1:02:52.960 --> 1:02:56.880]  look, if you really insist on doing this investigation, I can give you some office
[1:02:56.880 --> 1:02:58.440]  space in my building downtown.
[1:02:58.440 --> 1:03:02.880]  No, that's fine, we're just here to do the investigation right here, and he said, okay,
[1:03:02.880 --> 1:03:06.760]  I didn't explain myself well enough, you either get out of my county right now, or you're
[1:03:06.760 --> 1:03:09.800]  going into a four by eight cell in my jail.
[1:03:09.800 --> 1:03:14.440]  Well, they didn't cotton nicely to that, they called their supervisor to find out what they
[1:03:14.440 --> 1:03:15.640]  should do.
[1:03:15.640 --> 1:03:22.640]  This is key, the guy said, the FBI supervisor told them, a sheriff, which means any sheriff
[1:03:22.640 --> 1:03:26.520]  can do that, and knowing that sheriff, he probably will.
[1:03:26.520 --> 1:03:28.240]  That's how I think it's going to come down.
[1:03:28.240 --> 1:03:33.040]  And of course, that was always known, we have to re-exercise that right instead of Obama
[1:03:33.040 --> 1:03:38.160]  and these fusion centers, which are a total federalization and takeover of our local
[1:03:38.160 --> 1:03:39.160]  communities, go ahead.
[1:03:39.160 --> 1:03:45.600]  That's exactly right, when we go vote, especially probably next year, many sheriffs will be
[1:03:45.600 --> 1:03:50.960]  up on the ballot, if not probably two to four years following.
[1:03:50.960 --> 1:03:57.440]  It's really essential that we ask them, would you enforce a state law like Montana's or
[1:03:57.440 --> 1:04:02.000]  Tennessee's, and explain to them if they haven't heard of it and get their answer.
[1:04:02.000 --> 1:04:05.840]  It's not enough to say, well, I'm for the second amendment, well, golly, senators, Schumer
[1:04:05.840 --> 1:04:08.680]  says that, that doesn't tell me anything.
[1:04:08.680 --> 1:04:12.760]  I want to know what they will do in that specific situation.
[1:04:12.760 --> 1:04:18.560]  And if they will do what that Franklin County, Tennessee sheriff was willing to do, then
[1:04:18.560 --> 1:04:22.200]  I think we've got the country coming back to where it belongs.
[1:04:22.200 --> 1:04:26.600]  We've seen the same reaction on the national ID card.
[1:04:26.600 --> 1:04:32.480]  A number of states have said, no way, Jose, no info going to Washington for that.
[1:04:32.480 --> 1:04:34.480]  Our bureaucrats go to jail before you get it.
[1:04:34.480 --> 1:04:35.480]  Absolutely.
[1:04:35.480 --> 1:04:37.680]  Larry, I got to get you back up soon for a full hour.
[1:04:37.680 --> 1:04:40.840]  Thank you for your time on short notice, gunowners.org.
[1:04:40.840 --> 1:04:44.600]  Join it or at least sign up for the free email alerts right on the site.
[1:04:44.600 --> 1:04:47.400]  We've got to take the local government over.
[1:04:47.400 --> 1:04:50.120]  That's where the globalists are taking over our society.
[1:04:50.120 --> 1:04:51.480]  Great advice, Larry Pratt.
[1:04:51.480 --> 1:04:52.480]  God bless you.
[1:04:52.480 --> 1:04:53.480]  You too, Alex.
[1:04:53.480 --> 1:04:54.480]  Thank you much.
[1:04:54.480 --> 1:04:55.480]  Thank you for being with us.
[1:04:55.480 --> 1:05:00.360]  We'll be right back with Mike Rivera joining us from Hawaii via video cam.
[1:05:00.360 --> 1:05:05.040]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want
[1:05:05.040 --> 1:05:06.040]  you to eat.
[1:05:06.040 --> 1:05:10.120]  To continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick,
[1:05:10.120 --> 1:05:14.160]  go to the doctor and buy their drugs, you don't have to cooperate.
[1:05:14.160 --> 1:05:15.480]  There is a solution.
[1:05:15.480 --> 1:05:19.040]  Inner Health Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing
[1:05:19.040 --> 1:05:23.880]  products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.
[1:05:23.880 --> 1:05:29.000]  Try their inner food with 20 organic ingredients full of dense nutrition that gives you the
[1:05:29.000 --> 1:05:31.280]  energy you need and will keep you well.
[1:05:31.280 --> 1:05:36.440]  Even won the award for best super food of 2009 from our friend, Mike Adams, the health
[1:05:36.440 --> 1:05:37.440]  manager.
[1:05:37.440 --> 1:05:42.120]  I love their Nutric Cafe, great organic coffee, infused with herbal extracts to boost your
[1:05:42.120 --> 1:05:43.360]  immune system.
[1:05:43.360 --> 1:05:47.440]  Try all of their truly honest products that will keep you alive and healthy.

[1:06:00.280 --> 1:06:03.640]  Have you ever wanted to generate your own supply of electrical power?
[1:06:03.640 --> 1:06:07.480]  If so, this is going to be the most important message you will ever hear.
[1:06:07.480 --> 1:06:11.920]  Solar power generators are now available from Solutions from Science in Thompson, Illinois.
[1:06:11.920 --> 1:06:16.360]  These emergency backup systems provide life-saving electrical power when you need it most.
[1:06:16.360 --> 1:06:21.560]  Unlike gas generators, a solar generator runs quietly, emits no fumes and produces electricity
[1:06:21.560 --> 1:06:22.560]  for free.
[1:06:22.560 --> 1:06:26.200]  It's like having an electric power plant running quietly in your own home.
[1:06:26.200 --> 1:06:31.000]  On some pumps, shortwave radios, computers, and even keep food from spoiling.
[1:06:31.000 --> 1:06:35.440]  Whether it's hurricanes, ice storms, brownouts, or blackouts, you'll never have to suffer
[1:06:35.440 --> 1:06:37.560]  through painful power outages again.
[1:06:37.560 --> 1:06:40.000]  When the power goes out, you'll be ready.
[1:06:40.000 --> 1:06:45.880]  With a solar power generator from Solutions from Science, go to mysolarbackup.com and
[1:06:45.880 --> 1:06:47.760]  get off the grid today.
[1:06:47.760 --> 1:06:58.480]  Go to mysolarbackup.com or call 877-327-0365, 877-327-0365.
[1:06:58.480 --> 1:06:59.480]  Don't wait.
[1:06:59.480 --> 1:07:00.480]  Call today.
[1:07:00.480 --> 1:07:04.920]  You've heard to get the T commercials, and many people like our commercials, but I did
[1:07:04.920 --> 1:07:06.320]  notice something.
[1:07:06.320 --> 1:07:07.760]  What the heck is a toxin?
[1:07:07.760 --> 1:07:08.920]  So here it is.
[1:07:08.920 --> 1:07:14.640]  A toxin is a poisonous substance that is capable of causing disease when introduced into the
[1:07:14.640 --> 1:07:15.640]  body.
[1:07:15.640 --> 1:07:18.520]  It's a carbohydrate from sea cushions and particle board.
[1:07:18.520 --> 1:07:25.720]  How about carbon monoxide, furnace burning propane, butane, disinfectants, perfume,
[1:07:25.720 --> 1:07:31.560]  mouthwash, glues, air fresheners, pesticides, oh my gosh, even sugar is a toxin according
[1:07:31.560 --> 1:07:32.840]  to Dr. Lau.
[1:07:32.840 --> 1:07:34.760]  It's a very addictive drug.
[1:07:34.760 --> 1:07:37.160]  It's time to fight back.
[1:07:37.160 --> 1:07:39.520]  Get the T.com.
[1:07:39.520 --> 1:07:41.360]  Let's get the T.com.
[1:07:41.360 --> 1:07:51.760]  Or you can get your trusty cell phone out and call us at 928-308-0408 again, 928-308-0408
[1:07:51.760 --> 1:07:53.360]  and put in your order today.
[1:07:53.360 --> 1:07:58.360]  Lose weight, feel good, and be free of all these toxins.
[1:07:58.360 --> 1:08:14.960]  Get the T.com.
[1:08:14.960 --> 1:08:19.320]  With us five, 10 minutes in the next hour with this monthly visit is Mike Rivera, fellow
[1:08:19.320 --> 1:08:20.320]  talk show host here on Genesis.
[1:08:20.320 --> 1:08:23.440]  We're going to go to him in one moment to get into the flu.
[1:08:23.440 --> 1:08:28.320]  His perspective on that, always enjoy getting his interesting take on things, very well
[1:08:28.320 --> 1:08:29.320]  informed.
[1:08:29.320 --> 1:08:33.080]  And we've got William Lewis, Gary Franchi later in the next hour joining us.
[1:08:33.080 --> 1:08:37.600]  How the hardened Montana with the biggest developments yet coming out on this.
[1:08:37.600 --> 1:08:41.880]  How that ties into their film Camp FEMA, that's going to be very, very informative, and we'll
[1:08:41.880 --> 1:08:45.480]  continue with open phones in the fourth hour today.
[1:08:45.480 --> 1:08:51.000]  There is a key story up on PrismPlanet.com that I worked on with Paul Watson.
[1:08:51.000 --> 1:08:55.320]  It's doctors concerned flu-miss vaccine could spread live H1N1 virus.
[1:08:55.320 --> 1:09:01.600]  Now, people, the COINTELPRO always accused me of exaggerating or trying to scare people.
[1:09:01.600 --> 1:09:03.480]  No, it's actually much scarier.
[1:09:03.480 --> 1:09:07.280]  If you read what the Mayo Clinic said and all these other mainstream documents and the
[1:09:07.280 --> 1:09:15.720]  inserts and what Fox News is even saying, no, they admit it will spread the virus.
[1:09:15.720 --> 1:09:20.080]  And it's a live virus and it will mutate and some will be weaker, some will be stronger.
[1:09:20.080 --> 1:09:24.480]  So see Watson gave that a weak headline.
[1:09:24.480 --> 1:09:26.520]  Nine times out of 10, we do.
[1:09:26.520 --> 1:09:29.920]  It's worse than this headline, but this article's got all the facts.
[1:09:29.920 --> 1:09:31.600]  It needs to be gotten out.
[1:09:31.600 --> 1:09:35.320]  Doctors concerned flu-miss vaccine could spread live H1N1 virus.
[1:09:35.320 --> 1:09:41.320]  Well, 60% of U.S. population at risk is swine flu, nasal spray, a pandemic waiting to happen.
[1:09:41.320 --> 1:09:42.760]  Now, Mike got cut off.
[1:09:42.760 --> 1:09:46.560]  I promised to go to Mike, a listener from Tennessee, about neighbors like it's a rock
[1:09:46.560 --> 1:09:47.560]  star.
[1:09:47.560 --> 1:09:49.320]  It's a fad or ooh, they're getting it.
[1:09:49.320 --> 1:09:50.320]  Oh, yeah.
[1:09:50.320 --> 1:09:53.720]  And when your kids get brain damage, it's like a fad, you know, for the breast cancer,
[1:09:53.720 --> 1:09:58.600]  or a fad for the autism, or a fad for, you know, third of the kids in my neighborhood
[1:09:58.600 --> 1:09:59.600]  are dying of cancer.
[1:09:59.600 --> 1:10:02.800]  You know, people in my office that I know are dying of cancer, their girlfriends are
[1:10:02.800 --> 1:10:05.000]  dying of cancer.
[1:10:05.000 --> 1:10:08.440]  Rob Doos, 30-something-year-old friend, been in a band with him for 10 years, she just
[1:10:08.440 --> 1:10:09.720]  died of cancer last week.
[1:10:09.720 --> 1:10:12.480]  Just, you know, oh, but we have meetings about it.
[1:10:12.480 --> 1:10:15.040]  We talk about it and we make it all fancy and fun.
[1:10:15.040 --> 1:10:17.320]  And how about we stop taking their shots?
[1:10:17.320 --> 1:10:20.720]  See, because it's not my opinion they're putting cancer viruses in the vaccine.
[1:10:20.720 --> 1:10:22.040]  They said they'd do it.
[1:10:22.040 --> 1:10:23.520]  It's in the government documents.
[1:10:23.520 --> 1:10:24.520]  It's in eco science.
[1:10:24.520 --> 1:10:26.440]  They're poisoning our water.
[1:10:26.440 --> 1:10:30.960]  I mean, look, the reason they're getting away with this is the horror factor.
[1:10:30.960 --> 1:10:32.200]  No one can deal with that.
[1:10:32.200 --> 1:10:34.320]  It's hard for me to deal with it.
[1:10:34.320 --> 1:10:35.320]  They're doing this.
[1:10:35.320 --> 1:10:40.560]  The only reason they don't kill me is because they know I'm telling an extremely accurate
[1:10:40.560 --> 1:10:42.360]  representation of what's really going on.
[1:10:42.360 --> 1:10:44.640]  I'm not perfect, but I got a good picture on me.
[1:10:44.640 --> 1:10:47.760]  My scopes got them in the sights.
[1:10:47.760 --> 1:10:51.920]  And they sure don't want to kill me and make a big example out of it, folks, because I'm
[1:10:51.920 --> 1:10:55.120]  dead on with what they're doing because I read their textbooks.
[1:10:55.120 --> 1:10:59.840]  Let me tell you, I mean, I spend hours every day researching what I talk about here.
[1:10:59.840 --> 1:11:03.440]  And let me tell you, there's no going back once you know this.
[1:11:03.440 --> 1:11:06.960]  Then you can't even hate the cops when they violate the First Amendment and say no protest
[1:11:06.960 --> 1:11:12.760]  allowed in D.C. or Pittsburgh and beat women in the head and have police dogs attack women.
[1:11:12.760 --> 1:11:13.840]  You don't like them.
[1:11:13.840 --> 1:11:14.840]  You're angry at them.
[1:11:14.840 --> 1:11:19.280]  You think they're thugs, but you know, those idiots are drinking sodium fluoride water.
[1:11:19.280 --> 1:11:20.400]  They're taking vaccines.
[1:11:20.400 --> 1:11:21.760]  Their kids are taking it.
[1:11:21.760 --> 1:11:23.640]  You want to save them.
[1:11:23.640 --> 1:11:29.160]  You want to stop fighting with them and reach out to them and splash some cold water in
[1:11:29.160 --> 1:11:35.320]  their face psychologically and say, look, look at what we're saying.
[1:11:35.320 --> 1:11:39.400]  Live flu virus is the first vaccine they're putting out, admitting it will spread the
[1:11:39.400 --> 1:11:40.400]  real flu.
[1:11:40.400 --> 1:11:43.560]  Then it creates all this fear that everybody gets the shot.
[1:11:43.560 --> 1:11:44.560]  It's hidden in plain view.
[1:11:44.560 --> 1:11:47.480]  I'm going to get Mike Rivera's take on that in a moment, but I promise to go to Mike and
[1:11:47.480 --> 1:11:48.480]  Tennessee.
[1:11:48.480 --> 1:11:50.000]  Mike, finish the point you were trying to make.
[1:11:50.000 --> 1:11:51.000]  Go ahead.
[1:11:51.000 --> 1:11:55.920]  Well, real quick, this lady that I spoke to today, she was talking, she's always shot
[1:11:55.920 --> 1:12:00.440]  and she can't wait to get her child the swine flu shot talked about.
[1:12:00.440 --> 1:12:01.440]  She wanted her child.
[1:12:01.440 --> 1:12:04.960]  She always gets her child everything, anything they say that she needs.
[1:12:04.960 --> 1:12:09.840]  She's the first one in line to get it as though it's somewhat like an accessory, a purse,
[1:12:09.840 --> 1:12:11.600]  new pair of shoes or something.
[1:12:11.600 --> 1:12:16.160]  And today in this one of the dying papers around the country, the commercial appeal,
[1:12:16.160 --> 1:12:19.920]  the article in here talks about the lady who tilted her head back.
[1:12:19.920 --> 1:12:24.120]  The first person in the country to get the swine flu sniffer says she tilted her head
[1:12:24.120 --> 1:12:29.120]  back and snipped hard and became the first American to be given the H1N1 flu vaccine.
[1:12:29.120 --> 1:12:33.960]  And then real quick, and I know you got to go on the intersection, buried in the paper,
[1:12:33.960 --> 1:12:37.360]  the part that you probably wouldn't read unless you're like me and you read every bit of this.
[1:12:37.360 --> 1:12:43.160]  It says, partners at La Bonner who received the vaccine Monday had to sign a consent form
[1:12:43.160 --> 1:12:49.160]  and were given a CDC card providing they were, or proving they were given the drug.
[1:12:49.160 --> 1:12:51.440]  A CDC card to prove it.
[1:12:51.440 --> 1:12:53.360]  Yeah, sir, I appreciate your call.
[1:12:53.360 --> 1:12:58.320]  We covered this yesterday and this is all admitted, AP Reuters, I'm going to go back
[1:12:58.320 --> 1:13:01.960]  over to microvario coming up, we're going to mic right now.
[1:13:01.960 --> 1:13:07.560]  They admit that it's a live virus, that the perfect place for it to breed and mutate is
[1:13:07.560 --> 1:13:13.140]  the nasal passages and the mucous membranes of the sinus.
[1:13:13.140 --> 1:13:19.440]  The sinus is huge, it sits up underneath the brain, the sinus is very large.
[1:13:19.440 --> 1:13:24.920]  But the point is, in fact, maybe we should pull up a Google image of the sinus and let
[1:13:24.920 --> 1:13:28.920]  people see how it sits behind the nose right underneath the brain.
[1:13:28.920 --> 1:13:34.560]  They pump it in there, it breeds, and then they admit that no H1N1 trials were done.
[1:13:34.560 --> 1:13:44.120]  I have those headlines that the trial is the people being given the live mutating virus.
[1:13:44.120 --> 1:13:49.640]  It's so huge, it's so obvious, it's so out in the open and now it's going to spread everywhere.
[1:13:49.640 --> 1:13:52.800]  People kept saying this is very weak, this isn't killing hardly anybody.
[1:13:52.800 --> 1:13:57.240]  This is on the scale much weaker than the regular seasonal flu, wild fear, because they're
[1:13:57.240 --> 1:13:59.040]  going to spread it and mutate it.
[1:13:59.040 --> 1:14:00.040]  Let's go to microvario.
[1:14:00.040 --> 1:14:01.560]  Mike, what do you think about what's happening?
[1:14:01.560 --> 1:14:05.820]  Well, it's a very dangerous and reckless approach to this kind of a medical situation
[1:14:05.820 --> 1:14:11.000]  and over at WhatReallyHappened.com, we just posted an article from one of the German newspapers,
[1:14:11.000 --> 1:14:14.740]  German magazines, they're basically saying the same thing, that if you get the swine
[1:14:14.740 --> 1:14:19.480]  flu vaccine, it will make you more likely to come down with the swine flu.
[1:14:19.480 --> 1:14:20.480]  And that seems to be counterproductive.
[1:14:20.480 --> 1:14:21.480]  Well, that's actually the CDC.
[1:14:21.480 --> 1:14:25.040]  The CDC says, if you take the swine flu shot, you're more likely to get it.
[1:14:25.040 --> 1:14:29.440]  I mean, I have that in my stack, that's what I mean, this is insane.
[1:14:29.440 --> 1:14:33.280]  It absolutely is, and without even getting into the question of possible motives at this
[1:14:33.280 --> 1:14:34.800]  point, I don't even really care.
[1:14:34.800 --> 1:14:39.680]  You go back and you look at the swine flu epidemic and vaccination of 1976, the vaccine
[1:14:39.680 --> 1:14:42.880]  killed 50 times as many people as the flu itself did.
[1:14:42.880 --> 1:14:47.520]  This is nonsense, it is reckless beyond belief, they're not testing this stuff.
[1:14:47.520 --> 1:14:53.080]  And remember, only last year, Baxter allowed a test vaccine out for trials that had live
[1:14:53.080 --> 1:14:54.840]  bird flu virus in it.
[1:14:54.840 --> 1:14:58.160]  We don't know if this is the one that was being used up in Norway when they did some
[1:14:58.160 --> 1:15:02.520]  tests on some homeless people, and a bunch of those people died, you don't know if it,
[1:15:02.520 --> 1:15:07.400]  but I mean, obviously something was being tested in Norway that killed a bunch of people.
[1:15:07.400 --> 1:15:12.560]  And it's reckless and it's dangerous, but it's hugely profitable for the pharmaceutical
[1:15:12.560 --> 1:15:16.720]  companies who've all made the appropriate tithing to their local congressmen, congressional
[1:15:16.720 --> 1:15:20.840]  campaigns, and it's simply peddling snake oil.
[1:15:20.840 --> 1:15:24.400]  I mean, our current medical establishment in the United States is operating on the same
[1:15:24.400 --> 1:15:29.640]  moral and ethical level as the old Wild West traveling medicine show salesman, ride the
[1:15:29.640 --> 1:15:34.040]  wagon into town, crank down the stage, do a song and dance, make all kinds of claims
[1:15:34.040 --> 1:15:37.160]  and sell bottles full of whatever they found out in the desert.
[1:15:37.160 --> 1:15:40.760]  And you're lucky if it doesn't kill you, let alone actually help you in any way, shape,
[1:15:40.760 --> 1:15:41.760]  or form.
[1:15:41.760 --> 1:15:42.760]  That's where we are.
[1:15:42.760 --> 1:15:47.760]  We're finding out just yesterday that after decades of all this fluoridation of tap water,
[1:15:47.760 --> 1:15:51.120]  it doesn't really have any effect on dental cavities at all.
[1:15:51.120 --> 1:15:52.440]  So why are they putting it in there?
[1:15:52.440 --> 1:15:55.840]  Well, because they need to get rid of the waste product and they can make money doing
[1:15:55.840 --> 1:15:56.840]  it.
[1:15:56.840 --> 1:15:58.880]  And it makes people docile in all the studies.
[1:15:58.880 --> 1:16:03.080]  Actually two years ago, the American Dental Association said don't have kids brush their
[1:16:03.080 --> 1:16:04.080]  teeth.
[1:16:04.080 --> 1:16:09.280]  It causes fractures in the teeth and dental fluorosis and doubles bone cancer of just
[1:16:09.280 --> 1:16:11.080]  one type in boys.
[1:16:11.080 --> 1:16:12.920]  And all the other studies show all these other cancers.
[1:16:12.920 --> 1:16:15.320]  I mean, this is not debatable.
[1:16:15.320 --> 1:16:16.320]  This is a fact.
[1:16:16.320 --> 1:16:18.360]  And you mentioned the stuff in Norway.
[1:16:18.360 --> 1:16:24.520]  The London Telegraph reported that in Poland, 21 of 100 homeless people in a bird flu vaccine
[1:16:24.520 --> 1:16:29.360]  trial all died and that it was a unnamed pharmaceutical company.
[1:16:29.360 --> 1:16:34.600]  So that's confirmed that that was a, but I mean, to see Shepard Smith on Fox saying
[1:16:34.600 --> 1:16:38.760]  it's a conspiracy theory, the swine flu shot cannot hurt you.
[1:16:38.760 --> 1:16:45.120]  When I have the insert of the five big makers, every one of the insert says Gillian Beret.
[1:16:45.120 --> 1:16:48.640]  Am I pronouncing that right or Guillaume Beret?
[1:16:48.640 --> 1:16:52.800]  I mean, I have these, I'll show them again coming up.
[1:16:52.800 --> 1:16:55.480]  I'll show for prisonplanet.tv viewers scans.
[1:16:55.480 --> 1:16:58.040]  They're admitting it causes autoimmune problems.
[1:16:58.040 --> 1:16:59.920]  It's admitting it can give you cancer.
[1:16:59.920 --> 1:17:03.800]  It says on the insert it can sterilize you or reduce fertility.
[1:17:03.800 --> 1:17:09.640]  I mean, how can Shepard Smith and the rest of TV say it cannot hurt you knowing it's
[1:17:09.640 --> 1:17:11.920]  going to mess a bunch of people up?
[1:17:11.920 --> 1:17:15.760]  They were saying the exact same thing back in 1976, if you go out on YouTube, somebody's
[1:17:15.760 --> 1:17:20.640]  put up a video of all the propaganda that was hitting the television airwaves in 1976
[1:17:20.640 --> 1:17:24.600]  about how important it was to get the shot and how it was going to save your life and
[1:17:24.600 --> 1:17:25.600]  make you better.
[1:17:25.600 --> 1:17:28.960]  And of course, the exact opposite thing happened here.
[1:17:28.960 --> 1:17:33.040]  It's all about selling product and they don't really care what it does.
[1:17:33.040 --> 1:17:35.360]  Once it goes out, they've made their money.
[1:17:35.360 --> 1:17:36.360]  They don't care.
[1:17:36.360 --> 1:17:38.000]  And the stuff is incredibly dangerous.
[1:17:38.000 --> 1:17:42.680]  They're not testing it fully, in some cases under this so-called fast track, they're not
[1:17:42.680 --> 1:17:44.920]  testing some of these adjuvants at all.
[1:17:44.920 --> 1:17:48.640]  It's just stuff they think will work, so hey, let's put it in there and see what happens.
[1:17:48.640 --> 1:17:52.640]  And it's very dangerous because as you say, we're dealing with a lot of materials which
[1:17:52.640 --> 1:17:57.400]  are capable of mutation and intermixing within the body and the interactions have never been
[1:17:57.400 --> 1:18:00.280]  tested for either with all these adjuvants they're putting together.
[1:18:00.280 --> 1:18:02.720]  This is incredibly dangerous and reckless stuff.
[1:18:02.720 --> 1:18:08.640]  Well, I've got a story up on www.prisonplanet.com that has all these links to Mayo Clinic mainstream
[1:18:08.640 --> 1:18:14.480]  reports where they just calmly announce, oh, this is a live vaccine and it's going to
[1:18:14.480 --> 1:18:16.440]  mutate and going to spread.
[1:18:16.440 --> 1:18:21.000]  I mean, how obvious is it, Mike, or do you agree that they're first giving the type that
[1:18:21.000 --> 1:18:26.000]  will spread to actually create the fear and actually spread it and spread sickness and
[1:18:26.000 --> 1:18:31.120]  spread people testing positive for the antibodies so they get panicked and get the shot?
[1:18:31.120 --> 1:18:35.880]  I think that's probably exactly what's going on here because down the road, ultimately,
[1:18:35.880 --> 1:18:38.040]  we are going to pay for all of this stuff.
[1:18:38.040 --> 1:18:41.700]  It's always taxpayer funded or it comes out of some other way or they may be somewhere
[1:18:41.700 --> 1:18:45.280]  down the road where there's a new vaccine that we have to pay for privately.
[1:18:45.280 --> 1:18:50.000]  It's all about sucking the last of the money out of the American people under any pretext
[1:18:50.000 --> 1:18:53.680]  whatsoever, swine flu, global warming, health insurance, whatever.
[1:18:53.680 --> 1:18:57.160]  They're grabbing the last few nickels out of our pockets before they skedaddle for the
[1:18:57.160 --> 1:18:58.160]  border.
[1:18:58.160 --> 1:19:01.600]  Well, that was my next point.
[1:19:01.600 --> 1:19:05.200]  You would think with the media losing credibility, losing ratings, getting discredited, they
[1:19:05.200 --> 1:19:06.680]  would start being more credible.
[1:19:06.680 --> 1:19:14.040]  Instead, it seems like the lying has gone tenfold wall to wall as if they're in panic
[1:19:14.040 --> 1:19:15.040]  mode.
[1:19:15.040 --> 1:19:20.040]  I agree, absolutely, and nothing, I think, shows that more than the last two weeks.
[1:19:20.040 --> 1:19:25.160]  We're following on the Goldstone report about Israel and then the UN requesting Israel to
[1:19:25.160 --> 1:19:28.280]  sign the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and submit to inspections.
[1:19:28.280 --> 1:19:33.480]  Israel says no, then Iran turns around and informs the IAEA they're starting to build
[1:19:33.480 --> 1:19:37.840]  a new facility and it shows to the entire world Iran is playing by the rules, Israel
[1:19:37.840 --> 1:19:38.840]  is not.
[1:19:38.840 --> 1:19:40.240]  And so what does the American media do?
[1:19:40.240 --> 1:19:45.280]  They crank up this nonstop rock and roll full tilt boogie propaganda campaign to resell
[1:19:45.280 --> 1:19:49.880]  the idea that Iran are the bad guys and the US and Israel are the really good guys and
[1:19:49.880 --> 1:19:53.280]  we should not pay attention to the fact that Iran is playing by the rules because they're
[1:19:53.280 --> 1:19:54.880]  only doing it to throw us off.
[1:19:54.880 --> 1:19:59.560]  Let's talk about Iran, Afghanistan next, then get into the death of the dollar.
[1:19:59.560 --> 1:20:01.280]  Stay with us.
[1:20:01.280 --> 1:20:05.480]  What would your life be like if you woke up each morning with new vitality, feeling better
[1:20:05.480 --> 1:20:09.040]  than you have in years, and you noticed a difference in your sleeping patterns, blood
[1:20:09.040 --> 1:20:11.640]  sugar levels, and had a sense of well-being overall?
[1:20:11.640 --> 1:20:15.840]  There's something that is changing thousands of people's lives and you could be one of
[1:20:15.840 --> 1:20:16.840]  them.
[1:20:16.840 --> 1:20:18.360]  It's called Heart and Body Extract.
[1:20:18.360 --> 1:20:22.640]  Sharon Harris, co-creator of Heart and Body Extract, talks about the positive effects
[1:20:22.640 --> 1:20:24.120]  of Heart and Body Extract.
[1:20:24.120 --> 1:20:28.400]  What happens with the formula Heart and Body Extract is it's giving the body the necessary
[1:20:28.400 --> 1:20:34.080]  vitamins, minerals, amino acids, enzymes, and phytonutrients so the body will heal itself.
[1:20:34.080 --> 1:20:38.720]  And yes, the body does have the ability to balance blood pressure, balance cholesterol,
[1:20:38.720 --> 1:20:40.240]  clean and unclog the arteries.
[1:20:40.240 --> 1:20:43.920]  It can also work on balancing the circulation for diabetics.
[1:20:43.920 --> 1:20:45.960]  So the body is an amazing thing.
[1:20:45.960 --> 1:20:49.200]  It simply needs some help so it has the tools to heal itself.
[1:20:49.200 --> 1:20:51.600]  Heart and Body Extract gets results.

[1:21:01.280 --> 1:21:06.600]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[1:21:06.600 --> 1:21:13.160]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong,
[1:21:13.160 --> 1:21:14.680]  just as well-funded.
[1:21:14.680 --> 1:21:19.840]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest
[1:21:19.840 --> 1:21:20.840]  of the American people.
[1:21:20.840 --> 1:21:25.400]  While Obama's already fudging, he's fudged since day one in this election.
[1:21:25.400 --> 1:21:30.840]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement, a personality cultist, who is imposing
[1:21:30.840 --> 1:21:37.360]  the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[1:21:37.360 --> 1:21:40.920]  It's not about left or right, it's about a one-world government.
[1:21:40.920 --> 1:21:47.840]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[1:21:56.000 --> 1:22:00.720]  The Obama deception, the people strike back.
[1:22:00.720 --> 1:22:04.080]  Jim Newcomer from Ida's Resources, October 6, 2009.
[1:22:04.080 --> 1:22:06.360]  Gold opened this morning at 10.29.70.

[1:22:13.520 --> 1:22:14.520]  for a quarter ounce.
[1:22:14.520 --> 1:22:26.040]  On June 4, 1963, Executive Order 11,110 was signed with the authority to strip the Federal
[1:22:26.040 --> 1:22:30.280]  Reserve Bank of its power to lend money to the United States government in interest.
[1:22:30.280 --> 1:22:33.520]  With the stroke of a pen, Kennedy would have put the Fed out of business.
[1:22:33.520 --> 1:22:37.920]  The November assassination quieted the production of the new currency, however the Executive
[1:22:37.920 --> 1:22:40.040]  Order still stands unrepealed.

[1:24:06.080 --> 1:24:14.640]  We're going to be getting into the drumbeat to abolish the dollar and replace it with
[1:24:14.640 --> 1:24:17.600]  something even worse.
[1:24:17.600 --> 1:24:20.920]  What that's going to mean to this nation is not pretty.
[1:24:20.920 --> 1:24:26.480]  This is much worse than any foreign military power could do to us.
[1:24:26.480 --> 1:24:28.200]  We're going to get more into the flu.
[1:24:28.200 --> 1:24:33.200]  We're going to get into what's happening with these fusion centers.
[1:24:33.200 --> 1:24:39.240]  Open announces by the President of the Federalization of Society, but going back to Mike Rivera.
[1:24:39.240 --> 1:24:43.120]  Mike, you got cut off by the break getting into Iran.
[1:24:43.120 --> 1:24:44.440]  I had Ray McGovern on last week.
[1:24:44.440 --> 1:24:47.520]  He agreed with your analysis, the comments I've had.
[1:24:47.520 --> 1:24:49.400]  It was a total hoax.
[1:24:49.400 --> 1:24:51.200]  Iran is always building these enrichment centers.
[1:24:51.200 --> 1:24:52.560]  They have a whole bunch of them.
[1:24:52.560 --> 1:24:53.560]  The site was known.
[1:24:53.560 --> 1:24:55.480]  They're getting ready to open it in a few months.
[1:24:55.480 --> 1:25:00.520]  They said here is a site that gets enrichment up to about 85% non-weapons grade.
[1:25:00.520 --> 1:25:03.120]  We'd like you to come inspect and set up stuff here.
[1:25:03.120 --> 1:25:06.720]  The media hoaxed it here and said, we found a secret base.
[1:25:06.720 --> 1:25:10.280]  Then the next day, oh, well, they told us about it sneakily.
[1:25:10.280 --> 1:25:12.760]  That's the contempt the media has for us.
[1:25:12.760 --> 1:25:15.800]  It was all a big hoax.
[1:25:15.800 --> 1:25:20.560]  First of all, the enrichment for fuel rods is only 5%, not 85%, and that's what Iran
[1:25:20.560 --> 1:25:22.960]  is basically working on.
[1:25:22.960 --> 1:25:28.360]  The idea was, as I said, the reason for this incredible explosion of anti-Iran propaganda
[1:25:28.360 --> 1:25:32.560]  was to distract the rest of the world from the fact that Iran was playing by the rules
[1:25:32.560 --> 1:25:36.360]  of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, to which it is a signer, and it was playing
[1:25:36.360 --> 1:25:40.240]  by the rules set down by the International Atomic Energy Agency.
[1:25:40.240 --> 1:25:44.920]  Only the week before, the United Nations had asked Israel to sign the NNPT and submit
[1:25:44.920 --> 1:25:47.760]  to inspections, and Israel said absolutely not.
[1:25:47.760 --> 1:25:53.760]  Last spring, the United States asked Israel to sign the NNPT and submit to inspections,
[1:25:53.760 --> 1:25:54.760]  and Israel said no.
[1:25:54.760 --> 1:25:59.760]  Do you remember Barack Obama's first press conference as President and Helen Thomas asked
[1:25:59.760 --> 1:26:01.760]  him that direct question?
[1:26:01.760 --> 1:26:06.160]  Other countries in the Middle East today have nuclear weapons, and Barack Obama put on his
[1:26:06.160 --> 1:26:10.640]  tap shoes and he tapped ants away and talked about non-proliferation and threats to peace
[1:26:10.640 --> 1:26:15.200]  and all the rest of it, and the reason he avoided actually answering the question is
[1:26:15.200 --> 1:26:20.800]  because under the Simonton Amendment to the Foreign Appropriations Act, it is illegal
[1:26:20.800 --> 1:26:26.720]  for the U.S. government to send any kind of financial aid to any country that has nuclear
[1:26:26.720 --> 1:26:31.400]  weapons and nuclear weapons technology that is not a signer of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation
[1:26:31.400 --> 1:26:34.480]  Treaty or allows IAEA inspections.
[1:26:34.480 --> 1:26:37.800]  In other words, all these billions and billions of dollars our government keeps giving to
[1:26:37.800 --> 1:26:44.760]  Israel is illegal if Israel has nuclear weapons, and so there's this sort of a secret nudge-nudge-wink-wink
[1:26:44.760 --> 1:26:48.680]  understanding between the U.S. and Israel where the U.S. will always pretend not to
[1:26:48.680 --> 1:26:52.720]  know that Israel is a nuclear power so they can go on looting money from the taxpayers
[1:26:52.720 --> 1:26:53.960]  and sending it to Israel.
[1:26:53.960 --> 1:26:59.280]  Now, saying that Israel can't protect themselves, I want you to continue your comment there,
[1:26:59.280 --> 1:27:01.720]  but I'm going to go back to this enrichment issue.
[1:27:01.720 --> 1:27:05.280]  I'm not a nuclear engineer like Bob Bowman or somebody, but I want to be clear from what
[1:27:05.280 --> 1:27:12.600]  I've read in the press, or if you're saying this is false, 95 percent centrifugal enrichment
[1:27:12.600 --> 1:27:16.920]  is what they need for an A-bomb, for weapons, now.
[1:27:16.920 --> 1:27:22.440]  The debate is they've said you don't need a high percentage for regular fuel rods.
[1:27:22.440 --> 1:27:26.880]  Why can some of your centrifuges get up to 84, 85, 86 percent?
[1:27:26.880 --> 1:27:28.960]  The point is it still won't make a bomb.
[1:27:28.960 --> 1:27:34.200]  My point is they do have centrifuges, I believe Iran's admitted this, up to 80-something percent,
[1:27:34.200 --> 1:27:36.320]  but the point is it's nowhere near the 95.
[1:27:36.320 --> 1:27:40.320]  Getting that other 10 percent is very, very hard to do compared to what you're saying
[1:27:40.320 --> 1:27:44.440]  about them only needing 5 percent for fuel rods, well then the question is why do they
[1:27:44.440 --> 1:27:45.440]  need that?
[1:27:45.440 --> 1:27:49.440]  Then the other debate comes in, they're many years away from a primitive A-bomb, no delivery
[1:27:49.440 --> 1:27:50.440]  system.
[1:27:50.440 --> 1:27:55.400]  The U.S. and England help give Pakistan nukes and delivery systems.
[1:27:55.400 --> 1:27:57.320]  Israel has 400 or more nukes.
[1:27:57.320 --> 1:27:59.080]  They have high tech delivery systems.
[1:27:59.080 --> 1:28:01.280]  Why is everybody picking on Iran?
[1:28:01.280 --> 1:28:05.080]  Well, everybody's picking on Iran because if you look through the newspapers over the
[1:28:05.080 --> 1:28:08.400]  last several years, Israel is the one saying, please go pick on Iran.
[1:28:08.400 --> 1:28:09.480]  We're afraid of Iran.
[1:28:09.480 --> 1:28:10.480]  Iran hates us.
[1:28:10.480 --> 1:28:12.720]  Medina Jad wants to wipe Israel off the map.
[1:28:12.720 --> 1:28:17.800]  It's the same kind of propaganda campaign we saw leading into the attack on Iraq.
[1:28:17.800 --> 1:28:18.800]  Israel says go kill them.
[1:28:18.800 --> 1:28:21.840]  The U.S. government says, yes, master, I must go kill.
[1:28:21.840 --> 1:28:26.880]  And the American kids are going to go die in the deserts of Iran because Israel has declared
[1:28:26.880 --> 1:28:29.520]  Iran is the next target and the next enemy.
[1:28:29.520 --> 1:28:33.160]  And of course, Iran is sitting on a lot of oil, especially in the south of the country.
[1:28:33.160 --> 1:28:37.240]  Iran is talking about avoiding the dollar as the oil currency of choice.
[1:28:37.240 --> 1:28:40.320]  They're going to go to the euros, all kinds of other things which are threats to American
[1:28:40.320 --> 1:28:42.080]  financial interests.
[1:28:42.080 --> 1:28:45.840]  Because the U.S. doesn't have anything to sell, we're using our threat of war to keep
[1:28:45.840 --> 1:28:49.280]  other countries to go along propping up U.S. debt.
[1:28:49.280 --> 1:28:53.540]  Now the other aspect and the reason they're pushing for yet another war in this huge mess
[1:28:53.540 --> 1:28:55.360]  of wars we've already got going.
[1:28:55.360 --> 1:28:59.420]  If you go back and you look at history, the U.S. got out of the crash of 1904 by getting
[1:28:59.420 --> 1:29:03.800]  into World War I. They got out of the crash of 1929 by getting into World War II.
[1:29:03.800 --> 1:29:07.200]  Now we're in the crash of 2007 and it's not a coincidence.
[1:29:07.200 --> 1:29:11.680]  Our government is trying to create a major war to distract us all from the fact that
[1:29:11.680 --> 1:29:15.480]  the U.S. government is what screwed up the economy and this country.
[1:29:15.480 --> 1:29:16.920]  And by the way, that's not your opinion.
[1:29:16.920 --> 1:29:23.360]  The Iran corporation a year ago said we need a giant multi-theater war on the scale of
[1:29:23.360 --> 1:29:28.200]  World War II to bring in the New World Order and they need that political diversion or
[1:29:28.200 --> 1:29:34.120]  stage terror or a swine flu pandemic or all three of them combined.
[1:29:34.120 --> 1:29:36.680]  We're entering the danger zone right now.
[1:29:36.680 --> 1:29:39.760]  Mike Rivera, let's continue to talk about that on the other side.
[1:29:39.760 --> 1:29:44.640]  They don't want to get into the media saying it's the Arabs are going to kill the dollar
[1:29:44.640 --> 1:29:51.400]  when it's our own G20, our own Geithner saying they're open to moving away from the dollar.
[1:29:51.400 --> 1:29:55.120]  Where on the march, the empire's on the run.
[1:29:55.120 --> 1:29:58.400]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[1:29:58.400 --> 1:30:04.160]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[1:30:04.160 --> 1:30:08.480]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition
[1:30:08.480 --> 1:30:09.480]  do you want?
[1:30:09.480 --> 1:30:15.040]  My answer would be all I can get in the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones.
[1:30:15.040 --> 1:30:16.520]  Food is your only ammunition.
[1:30:16.520 --> 1:30:17.760]  How much do you want?
[1:30:17.760 --> 1:30:18.840]  When do you want it?
[1:30:18.840 --> 1:30:20.800]  Now or after the battle starts?
[1:30:20.800 --> 1:30:21.920]  When will you need it?
[1:30:21.920 --> 1:30:24.040]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[1:30:24.040 --> 1:30:25.400]  Will there be any food?
[1:30:25.400 --> 1:30:26.840]  Will it make your children sick?
[1:30:26.840 --> 1:30:31.000]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center
[1:30:31.000 --> 1:30:32.160]  and be immunized?
[1:30:32.160 --> 1:30:35.920]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[1:30:35.920 --> 1:30:39.520]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[1:30:39.520 --> 1:30:40.760]  How much will you need?
[1:30:40.760 --> 1:30:41.760]  We don't know.
[1:30:41.760 --> 1:30:42.760]  How much do you want?
[1:30:42.760 --> 1:30:43.760]  All you can get.
[1:30:43.760 --> 1:30:44.760]  I'm Alex Jones.
[1:30:44.760 --> 1:30:52.440]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day, call 1-800-409-5633 or check it
[1:30:52.440 --> 1:31:00.160]  out on the web at eFoodsDirect.com, again that number 1-800-409-5633.
[1:31:00.160 --> 1:31:04.800]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want
[1:31:04.800 --> 1:31:05.800]  you to eat.
[1:31:05.800 --> 1:31:09.320]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you
[1:31:09.320 --> 1:31:10.320]  sick?
[1:31:10.320 --> 1:31:12.280]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[1:31:12.280 --> 1:31:13.920]  You don't have to cooperate.
[1:31:13.920 --> 1:31:15.240]  There is a solution.
[1:31:15.240 --> 1:31:18.800]  Inner health botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing
[1:31:18.800 --> 1:31:23.640]  products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.
[1:31:23.640 --> 1:31:28.760]  Try their inner food with 20 organic ingredients, full of dense nutrition that gives you the
[1:31:28.760 --> 1:31:31.000]  energy you need and will keep you well.
[1:31:31.000 --> 1:31:36.280]  It even won the award for best super food of 2009 from our friend Mike Adams, the health
[1:31:36.280 --> 1:31:37.280]  manager.
[1:31:37.280 --> 1:31:41.960]  I love their Nutric Cafe, great organic coffee, infused with herbal extracts to boost your
[1:31:41.960 --> 1:31:43.160]  immune system.
[1:31:43.160 --> 1:31:47.240]  Buy all of their truly honest products that will keep you alive and healthy.
[1:31:47.240 --> 1:31:54.760]  Go to enerfod.com, or give them a call right now, 866-762-9238.
[1:31:54.760 --> 1:32:00.840]  Click on their banner at infowars.com to see all the available discounts.
[1:32:00.840 --> 1:32:05.840]  Hi it's MZ wondering how many of us Alex Jones fans intend to take the swine flu vaccine?
[1:32:05.840 --> 1:32:09.520]  I'm not, don't trust it, but then I don't want to get the disease either.
[1:32:09.520 --> 1:32:15.520]  So I use PureWorks, a unique disinfectant that comes in foam or spray form.
[1:32:15.520 --> 1:32:17.800]  PureWorks is not your typical hand disinfectant.
[1:32:17.800 --> 1:32:22.320]  There is no alcohol to dry your skin and it lasts for hours, not minutes.
[1:32:22.320 --> 1:32:25.520]  Use PureWorks to protect yourself from disease and infection.
[1:32:25.520 --> 1:32:33.680]  You can find out all about it and order it online at nogerms.info, that's nogerms.info.
[1:32:33.680 --> 1:32:38.680]  Don't introduce potentially dangerous chemicals or toxins into your body to keep you well.
[1:32:38.680 --> 1:32:42.240]  And they could actually cause the sickness you want to avoid.
[1:32:42.240 --> 1:32:48.000]  Don't pick your nose, don't shake hands, and don't handle banisters, rails and doorknobs.
[1:32:48.000 --> 1:32:53.120]  Do try PureWorks, available online at wholesale pricing to Alex Jones listeners.
[1:32:53.120 --> 1:32:57.080]  Go to nogerms.info, that's nogerms.info.
[1:32:57.080 --> 1:33:20.160]  Be well and stay well, best MZ.
[1:33:20.160 --> 1:33:46.960]  Look, we have a corrupt elite who aren't going to turn loose, they're not going to
[1:33:46.960 --> 1:33:49.200]  stop what they're doing, they're not going to quit.
[1:33:49.200 --> 1:33:54.600]  And as long as we debate Barack Obama and George Bush and the new Mitt Romney, who's
[1:33:54.600 --> 1:34:00.880]  probably going to be the next Republican nominee, and he's a Mormon, he isn't, oh,
[1:34:00.880 --> 1:34:06.600]  look at Brett Favre, he beat his old team yesterday, look at all the people extorting
[1:34:06.600 --> 1:34:13.720]  David Letterman and all these other people, it doesn't matter, it's all theater.
[1:34:13.720 --> 1:34:22.040]  Obama is continuing the exact same policies on every point of Bush, just different rhetoric.
[1:34:22.040 --> 1:34:25.560]  And things are only going to get worse and worse until we turn around and stop this.
[1:34:25.560 --> 1:34:30.760]  Coming up in about 10 minutes, I'm going to play for the world premiere of the new fall
[1:34:30.760 --> 1:34:32.400]  of the Republic trailer.
[1:34:32.400 --> 1:34:37.120]  We're going to play it live here on air coming up in about 10 minutes, and we're going to
[1:34:37.120 --> 1:34:45.400]  be taking your calls, going back to Mike Rivera, Mike, looking at the end of the dollar.
[1:34:45.400 --> 1:34:50.440]  I saw the headlines, the London Telegraph today, the Independent also reported it, the demise
[1:34:50.440 --> 1:34:58.960]  of the dollar are the headlines, and it says oil states are plotting, but we have the G20,
[1:34:58.960 --> 1:35:02.600]  we have Russia, we have China, we have the United States, Geithner saying, yeah, we're
[1:35:02.600 --> 1:35:07.200]  going to SDRs, bank to bank, we'll still have our regional currencies, it's just going
[1:35:07.200 --> 1:35:12.880]  to be global digital transfers where the banks don't just have countries back up new debts
[1:35:12.880 --> 1:35:19.240]  they create and that they then loan, but that now the banks will just issue debt themselves.
[1:35:19.240 --> 1:35:22.680]  They've always done that through fractional reserve banking, now they're just removing
[1:35:22.680 --> 1:35:27.400]  the final links and then they're going to make us back up their Ponzi schemes.
[1:35:27.400 --> 1:35:29.320]  And so how do you see them killing the dollar?
[1:35:29.320 --> 1:35:34.160]  I mean, this continual drumbeat of kill the dollar, kill the dollar, kill the dollar,
[1:35:34.160 --> 1:35:39.880]  kill the dollar, kill the dollar, and then I'm seeing product placement in ads for soft
[1:35:39.880 --> 1:35:45.120]  drinks about keep the dollar, dump the euro, so there's definitely a big fight going on.
[1:35:45.120 --> 1:35:49.720]  From your research, who are the players, I want your perspective, what's going on, what's
[1:35:49.720 --> 1:35:55.200]  the larger picture in all of this, and do you see this being a slow death of the dollar
[1:35:55.200 --> 1:36:01.360]  phasing us into this new global bank where the banks openly become the world government?
[1:36:01.360 --> 1:36:05.560]  Well it's a complex issue, and first of all Saudi Arabia has already gone public saying
[1:36:05.560 --> 1:36:10.440]  that this story about this plot between the oil companies in Russia and the oil countries
[1:36:10.440 --> 1:36:14.760]  and Russia and China does not exist, now that doesn't necessarily mean it's so, but the
[1:36:14.760 --> 1:36:18.920]  dollar took a major beating and obviously those countries still holding a lot of dollar
[1:36:18.920 --> 1:36:24.400]  reserves don't want that to happen, so there's a big deny he said, she said going on.
[1:36:24.400 --> 1:36:29.680]  I tend to go with trusting Robert Fisk, he's got a good record of accuracy as to what's
[1:36:29.680 --> 1:36:30.680]  going on.
[1:36:30.680 --> 1:36:36.040]  As for the dollar, it's been dying a slow death ever since 1913 without question, and
[1:36:36.040 --> 1:36:42.840]  the problem I have is this whole reserve interest-bearing banking system ultimately is doomed to crash
[1:36:42.840 --> 1:36:49.120]  after crash after crash because the instant that first debt-based note goes into circulation,
[1:36:49.120 --> 1:36:52.560]  more money is owed to the banking system than is actually in existence.
[1:36:52.560 --> 1:36:57.040]  When everybody talks about all this huge government debt the US owes and all the debt the American
[1:36:57.040 --> 1:37:03.840]  people owes, it's not money that ever really existed, it is the accumulated compound interest
[1:37:03.840 --> 1:37:08.720]  over decade after decade of reckless spending by the US government, and of course the Federal
[1:37:08.720 --> 1:37:14.080]  Reserve is a private bank, it's no more federal than Federal Express, they encourage this,
[1:37:14.080 --> 1:37:18.340]  they encourage paying only the interest and never the principal, they support congressional
[1:37:18.340 --> 1:37:24.120]  campaigns for those candidates who will go on supporting this financial enslavement system,
[1:37:24.120 --> 1:37:28.160]  and so the problem is we've reached the point where nobody trusts the dollar anymore because
[1:37:28.160 --> 1:37:32.920]  it has to inflate just to cover its own indebtedness, and this is why we're seeing other countries
[1:37:32.920 --> 1:37:36.360]  start to very slowly and quietly get out of their dollar positions.
[1:37:36.360 --> 1:37:40.040]  Nobody wants to do something that will trigger a panic because that will hurt everybody,
[1:37:40.040 --> 1:37:44.000]  but once all the other countries are out of their dollar positions, then the rug is going
[1:37:44.000 --> 1:37:47.640]  to get pulled out from under it because there'll be nothing left to support it.
[1:37:47.640 --> 1:37:51.240]  In addition to this story that we had about the oil nations wanting to get out of the
[1:37:51.240 --> 1:37:55.000]  dollar, we're hearing all this talk about switching the reserve currency of the world
[1:37:55.000 --> 1:37:59.720]  away from the dollar, sort of undoing the last of the Bretton Woods Agreement, and without
[1:37:59.720 --> 1:38:05.520]  those two factors, creating artificial international demand for the dollars, who would want them?
[1:38:05.520 --> 1:38:09.200]  The US doesn't make anything anybody else wants to buy anymore.
[1:38:09.200 --> 1:38:14.200]  We're no longer an agricultural giant, we've lost our industry, we've lost our high tech,
[1:38:14.200 --> 1:38:17.920]  this nation has been looted, there's a TV show on the history channel just today, The
[1:38:17.920 --> 1:38:23.800]  Crumbling of America, showing how the US federal government has absolutely neglected the infrastructure
[1:38:23.800 --> 1:38:27.960]  of this country for decades, and it's literally falling apart.
[1:38:27.960 --> 1:38:32.920]  We're dissolving to a third world nation right before our eyes.
[1:38:32.920 --> 1:38:33.920]  And that's the plan.
[1:38:33.920 --> 1:38:37.560]  You go back to Maury Strong, we cover this in my film, Fall of the Republic.
[1:38:37.560 --> 1:38:43.080]  They openly wrote and stated at the United Nations Rio de Janeiro 92 meeting on population,
[1:38:43.080 --> 1:38:47.600]  they said we're going to destroy society, destroy industry to save the earth, we're
[1:38:47.600 --> 1:38:52.000]  going to create a debt system where the average person, even if they're hard working, can't
[1:38:52.000 --> 1:38:56.720]  get credit or can't get enough of a job to be able to have more than one child.
[1:38:56.720 --> 1:39:02.040]  We're going to have a social welfare system that bans any type of family support that
[1:39:02.040 --> 1:39:06.880]  bans neighborhoods keeping each other's kids, that's now happening worldwide, it's global
[1:39:06.880 --> 1:39:09.560]  implementation of the new global corporate state.
[1:39:09.560 --> 1:39:14.800]  They want us totally dependent on them so they can then social engineer us their psychopaths,
[1:39:14.800 --> 1:39:15.800]  their control freaks.
[1:39:15.800 --> 1:39:21.840]  They want us chained down in the barn so they can get the blowtorch and pliers out.
[1:39:21.840 --> 1:39:25.040]  That's what this control freak religions all about.
[1:39:25.040 --> 1:39:27.840]  And you know, they keep explaining on the news today.
[1:39:27.840 --> 1:39:32.280]  I was watching CNBC for 20 minutes, they were saying, look, it's a new economy.
[1:39:32.280 --> 1:39:37.400]  We have a 10% unemployment and this is a good economy and it's there's going to be more
[1:39:37.400 --> 1:39:38.400]  unemployed.
[1:39:38.400 --> 1:39:41.440]  And as long as the banks are making money, our economy is doing good.
[1:39:41.440 --> 1:39:46.600]  So we now have a jobless recovery, oxymoron, talk about that Mike from your perspective
[1:39:46.600 --> 1:39:47.600]  and then...
[1:39:47.600 --> 1:39:54.680]  Yeah, basically, the health of the economy is being defined solely in terms of the corporations
[1:39:54.680 --> 1:39:58.440]  which so far are surviving on taxpayer bailouts.
[1:39:58.440 --> 1:40:02.440]  And we are literally in a fascist economy where the wealth is being moved from the working
[1:40:02.440 --> 1:40:07.720]  and middle classes to the ultra rich, profits are kept private, losses are socialized, that
[1:40:07.720 --> 1:40:10.560]  is the hallmark of a fascist economy.
[1:40:10.560 --> 1:40:13.520]  And the bottom line is, if anybody wants to know what life is going to be like under
[1:40:13.520 --> 1:40:17.560]  this new corporate state, all you have to do is look back in history at the abuses of
[1:40:17.560 --> 1:40:22.320]  the company towns that we see out in the mining communities and the railroad camps and how
[1:40:22.320 --> 1:40:24.520]  horribly oppressive they were.
[1:40:24.520 --> 1:40:27.200]  That is exactly what is in store for all of us.
[1:40:27.200 --> 1:40:30.320]  Now we keep hearing all this stuff about how global government is going to be good and
[1:40:30.320 --> 1:40:32.160]  it's going to be wonderful, means the end of war.
[1:40:32.160 --> 1:40:35.560]  I'm sorry, global government is what Alexander the Great wanted.
[1:40:35.560 --> 1:40:37.360]  It was what the Roman Caesars wanted.
[1:40:37.360 --> 1:40:38.800]  It was what Napoleon wanted.
[1:40:38.800 --> 1:40:43.520]  It was what Hitler wanted and it brought more war and more death and more deprivation.
[1:40:43.520 --> 1:40:48.800]  And even after they got something approaching global government, it was a disaster for everybody.
[1:40:48.800 --> 1:40:53.600]  When Alexander the Great died, he deliberately shattered his empire to create new civil wars
[1:40:53.600 --> 1:40:57.040]  so that nobody else would ever be his equal in history.
[1:40:57.040 --> 1:40:59.760]  That's the kind of insanity that we see in the leadership.
[1:40:59.760 --> 1:41:04.200]  Every century, planet earth is cursed with a person or a group of people who think they
[1:41:04.200 --> 1:41:08.360]  have a right to control it all and they want to stand up on top of a pyramid built to their
[1:41:08.360 --> 1:41:13.080]  own vanity and scream, I am king of the world and it doesn't matter how much poverty and
[1:41:13.080 --> 1:41:16.960]  disease and starvation and privation and death they bring to the rest of the world to do
[1:41:16.960 --> 1:41:17.960]  it.
[1:41:17.960 --> 1:41:20.320]  Yeah, it's Yerkel the Turtle in fact going back to that.
[1:41:20.320 --> 1:41:25.200]  Big government is global tyranny and global government is worldwide straightjacket nowhere
[1:41:25.200 --> 1:41:27.920]  to run and that's why they want global standardization.
[1:41:27.920 --> 1:41:31.580]  The OECD, the IMF and World Bank all brag.
[1:41:31.580 --> 1:41:36.320]  That's what world government is, is a private group of bankers running your carbon footprint,
[1:41:36.320 --> 1:41:43.800]  taxing, tracking everything you do, taxing energy, taxing money transfers and bankrupting
[1:41:43.800 --> 1:41:49.320]  things and re-engineering the economy where you can only get a scholarship to be a cop
[1:41:49.320 --> 1:41:54.080]  or only be a scholarship to be a secret agent or only get a scholarship to data mine and
[1:41:54.080 --> 1:41:55.560]  surveil people.
[1:41:55.560 --> 1:42:00.040]  And so you've got all these people with degrees who rationalize what they're doing because
[1:42:00.040 --> 1:42:07.440]  that's their degree, that's who they are and what they are and it just gets worse and
[1:42:07.440 --> 1:42:14.800]  worse and worse and now as they engineer the crisis, they then pose as the saviors for
[1:42:14.800 --> 1:42:16.680]  the next leg of the solution.
[1:42:16.680 --> 1:42:23.960]  I want to go to a video clip now for PrismPlanet.tv viewers and a audio clip for the radio listeners.
[1:42:23.960 --> 1:42:30.840]  This is going to be going up at FollowTheRepublic.com, if you want to see it in the highest quality
[1:42:30.840 --> 1:42:35.560]  and members quality, PrismPlanet.tv members quality, it's in the members medium quality
[1:42:35.560 --> 1:42:38.840]  because it's not super high quality, a lot of folks don't have connections to download
[1:42:38.840 --> 1:42:44.760]  or stream but this is going up in the next 20, 30 minutes at FollowTheRepublic.com but
[1:42:44.760 --> 1:42:48.200]  here it is, premiered on the radio.
[1:42:48.200 --> 1:42:53.640]  This is the second major trailer, Rob Jacobson did this one, another one's coming out tomorrow
[1:42:53.640 --> 1:42:56.320]  on the mind control angle in the film.
[1:42:56.320 --> 1:43:02.320]  This is kind of a general trailer for FollowTheRepublic that you can pre-order now and then that means
[1:43:02.320 --> 1:43:07.880]  it'll be shipped out in the order it's received on or before October 21st on DVD in the highest
[1:43:07.880 --> 1:43:12.160]  quality and of course premiering at PrismPlanet.tv as well.
[1:43:12.160 --> 1:43:20.800]  Here is the latest trailer, trailer number two for Fall of the Republic.
[1:43:20.800 --> 1:43:25.360]  Thousands of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[1:43:25.360 --> 1:43:29.280]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[1:43:29.280 --> 1:43:33.640]  As we're finishing off this agenda, we're pulling the rug from underneath the Americans
[1:43:33.640 --> 1:43:34.640]  at home.
[1:43:34.640 --> 1:43:39.800]  They have tremendous influence on our president in Congress and they really are calling the
[1:43:39.800 --> 1:43:42.160]  shots.
[1:43:42.160 --> 1:43:47.240]  Now is the time for all good men and women to come to the aid of their country.
[1:43:47.240 --> 1:43:54.240]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[1:43:54.240 --> 1:44:07.600]  One of the greatest events in history is taking place before our very eyes.
[1:44:07.600 --> 1:44:12.320]  It's up to every man, woman and child in the United States to decide whether we're going
[1:44:12.320 --> 1:44:17.040]  to be fooled by the slick propaganda of the social engineers or whether we're going to
[1:44:17.040 --> 1:44:19.800]  restore the Republic.
[1:44:19.800 --> 1:44:25.000]  We have seen this erosion to the point where today seems like nobody does care and right
[1:44:25.000 --> 1:44:34.600]  now in Washington D.C. we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[1:44:34.600 --> 1:44:36.600]  Who's going to soak up the derivatives?
[1:44:36.600 --> 1:44:38.160]  Who's going to soak up the debt?
[1:44:38.160 --> 1:44:39.920]  Who's going to be penalized?
[1:44:39.920 --> 1:44:45.440]  Enron's CEO Ken Lay was involved in discussions with you at the White House about helping
[1:44:45.440 --> 1:44:49.800]  develop this type of policy, this trading scheme.
[1:44:49.800 --> 1:44:50.800]  I don't know.
[1:44:50.800 --> 1:44:54.720]  Do you think it's consistent with the spirit of that provision of the Constitution to hand
[1:44:54.720 --> 1:44:57.680]  out a half a trillion dollars to foreigners?
[1:44:57.680 --> 1:45:00.640]  Will we choose liberty or will we choose tyranny?
[1:45:00.640 --> 1:45:03.240]  The Republic is hanging by a thread.
[1:45:03.240 --> 1:45:06.120]  You don't have a president, you have an actor.
[1:45:06.120 --> 1:45:11.120]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists, they're asking for more matches and the Congress
[1:45:11.120 --> 1:45:14.960]  is saying who do we make the checkout to, who do we send these matches to?
[1:45:14.960 --> 1:45:20.960]  The last vestiges of our free system of government are being swept away.
[1:45:20.960 --> 1:45:23.760]  Fall of the Republic.
[1:45:23.760 --> 1:45:27.920]  Volume 1, the presidency of Barack Obama.
[1:45:27.920 --> 1:45:34.840]  Available on DVD at infowars.com and online at prisonpilot.tv.
[1:45:34.840 --> 1:45:38.760]  The destiny of humanity is in our hands.
[1:45:38.760 --> 1:45:45.760]  October 21st, 2009.
[1:45:45.760 --> 1:45:56.080]  Okay, and that's going up at falltherepublic.com right now and at prisonplanet.tv.
[1:45:56.080 --> 1:45:59.960]  And of course in the next few hours at the Alex Jones channel on YouTube if you wish
[1:45:59.960 --> 1:46:06.320]  to watch it again or for radio listeners who aren't watching prisonplanet.tv right now.
[1:46:06.320 --> 1:46:11.440]  Is this the fall of our republic, Mike Rivera, I mean, I think we should be honest that for
[1:46:11.440 --> 1:46:15.640]  all intents and purposes they're killing the dollar, that kills the empire.
[1:46:15.640 --> 1:46:19.240]  The country's already broke back over funding the empire because it's not our empire, it's
[1:46:19.240 --> 1:46:20.720]  a private banking empire.
[1:46:20.720 --> 1:46:21.720]  They're done with us now.
[1:46:21.720 --> 1:46:23.680]  They've kind of maxed out our credit card.
[1:46:23.680 --> 1:46:26.520]  And then if we don't come to grips with the fact that if we don't have the Bill of Rights
[1:46:26.520 --> 1:46:31.360]  and Constitution, we're just more real estate, more conquered dirt, and that by admitting
[1:46:31.360 --> 1:46:35.520]  we've seen the fall of our republic, then we can set about getting our country back
[1:46:35.520 --> 1:46:38.120]  or do you disagree with that statement?
[1:46:38.120 --> 1:46:41.680]  I would say we're at the point right now where we need to start seriously thinking about
[1:46:41.680 --> 1:46:45.960]  what we're going to build in the wake of the United States of America because I don't see
[1:46:45.960 --> 1:46:48.520]  this country being able to last much longer.
[1:46:48.520 --> 1:46:52.440]  I think much like the USSR, the US government is going to collapse.
[1:46:52.440 --> 1:46:56.480]  Now into that vacuum, a lot of opportunities are going to come in trying to sell us a one
[1:46:56.480 --> 1:47:01.120]  world government or some other ready made plug-in ready to rock and roll government.
[1:47:01.120 --> 1:47:05.480]  And I think we need to be aware of that with the buckets of tar and that's already happening.
[1:47:05.480 --> 1:47:07.840]  You're absolutely right, it's already happening.
[1:47:07.840 --> 1:47:12.360]  So I think we, the American people, have got to start sitting down and say, okay, if we're
[1:47:12.360 --> 1:47:16.280]  going to have a chance to create a whole new country, it is up to us to decide what it's
[1:47:16.280 --> 1:47:20.440]  going to be and to make sure that it's taking care of we, the people, and not just another
[1:47:20.440 --> 1:47:24.720]  group of rich opportunists coming in and treating the American people like we're just a bunch
[1:47:24.720 --> 1:47:25.720]  of herd animals.
[1:47:25.720 --> 1:47:29.200]  Now, I don't know if you're seeing these L-Rads and these microwave pain guns, they're
[1:47:29.200 --> 1:47:33.400]  starting to give out to the police forces, but frankly, that's just the modern equivalent
[1:47:33.400 --> 1:47:35.960]  of flogging the slaves back to the slave pens.
[1:47:35.960 --> 1:47:36.960]  Exactly, Mike.
[1:47:36.960 --> 1:47:38.880]  I wanted to ask you about that.
[1:47:38.880 --> 1:47:43.600]  These federal fusion centers going in even in small counties, Obama now admits that's
[1:47:43.600 --> 1:47:48.160]  for the patriots, the gun owners, the libertarians, the leftists, anybody that doesn't go along
[1:47:48.160 --> 1:47:53.560]  with mainline, drink your fluoride, inject your kids, worship global government.
[1:47:53.560 --> 1:47:58.000]  For anybody that's got two brain cells rubbed together, they're now deploying L-Rads through
[1:47:58.000 --> 1:48:01.880]  Homeland Security saying that's what Northcom's for.
[1:48:01.880 --> 1:48:07.800]  They're admitting this is a giant black ski mask, no protest allowed in D.C., no protest
[1:48:07.800 --> 1:48:08.800]  allowed in G-20.
[1:48:08.800 --> 1:48:14.600]  I mean, this is, this is Communist China, I mean, this is hellishly illegal.
[1:48:14.600 --> 1:48:17.640]  They're declaring war on the American people.
[1:48:17.640 --> 1:48:20.000]  We are now at war with our own government.
[1:48:20.000 --> 1:48:23.000]  The government has started the war, and I want to be very careful about this because
[1:48:23.000 --> 1:48:27.640]  I don't support and encourage violence because the first side that starts shooting will be
[1:48:27.640 --> 1:48:30.720]  seen as the bad guys in the war with low opinion.
[1:48:30.720 --> 1:48:34.560]  Because they're beating old women, they're having police dogs attack them, they're being
[1:48:34.560 --> 1:48:37.960]  caught provocaturing to make it look like we're throwing stuff first.
[1:48:37.960 --> 1:48:40.120]  You're absolutely right.
[1:48:40.120 --> 1:48:41.120]  Mike, you agree with me?
[1:48:41.120 --> 1:48:45.600]  They're losing the PR battle big time, but they're so arrogant, they're hubris is carrying
[1:48:45.600 --> 1:48:47.100]  them through.
[1:48:47.100 --> 1:48:48.400]  That's exactly right.
[1:48:48.400 --> 1:48:51.960]  What we're dealing with here is Rivera's law of mid-management.
[1:48:51.960 --> 1:48:55.680]  We have got all these super elites, most of whom are Cold War fossils who grew up in an
[1:48:55.680 --> 1:48:59.280]  age where the government could say and do anything and get away with it, and they're
[1:48:59.280 --> 1:49:03.600]  sitting on top of all these mid-level bureaucrats who want to keep their jobs, and so these
[1:49:03.600 --> 1:49:06.400]  mid-level bureaucrats are saying, oh yes, it's all working.
[1:49:06.400 --> 1:49:07.400]  They believe you.
[1:49:07.400 --> 1:49:09.600]  They still love the political leadership.
[1:49:09.600 --> 1:49:12.400]  They're ready to go to war, they're ready to die for Israel, and they're ready to give
[1:49:12.400 --> 1:49:16.640]  you more of their money and their children, and so our top leadership is very much out
[1:49:16.640 --> 1:49:21.680]  of touch with what's going on in Main Street America, and in that lies the eventual collapse
[1:49:21.680 --> 1:49:22.800]  of the U.S. government.
[1:49:22.800 --> 1:49:25.280]  They don't know what's really going on out here.
[1:49:25.280 --> 1:49:30.120]  They're being kept blind deliberately by their own staffers and aides who don't want to lose
[1:49:30.120 --> 1:49:32.240]  their jobs for having messed it up this bad.
[1:49:32.240 --> 1:49:37.440]  Well, that always happens with Hitler up until the day before he blew his head off in the
[1:49:37.440 --> 1:49:39.440]  bunker, if you believe that official story.
[1:49:39.440 --> 1:49:43.360]  The point is, they really thought they were going to win the war up until 24 hours before.
[1:49:43.360 --> 1:49:47.280]  They were delusional, and I see this more and more.
[1:49:47.280 --> 1:49:48.280]  The worm is turned.
[1:49:48.280 --> 1:49:49.280]  I know we're going to win.
[1:49:49.280 --> 1:49:53.840]  It's just going to be hellish and bloody and painful, and I would rather not go that
[1:49:53.840 --> 1:49:59.080]  route, but power corrupts, and the establishment just thinks they're invincible, and you're
[1:49:59.080 --> 1:50:04.200]  right that history shows that they're just repeating the same thing.
[1:50:04.200 --> 1:50:06.920]  So how do you see this shaking out, Mike?
[1:50:06.920 --> 1:50:10.880]  I am absolutely convinced that the U.S. government is going to collapse in the manner of the
[1:50:10.880 --> 1:50:15.600]  USSR, and we need to study what the Russians did that worked and what the Russians did
[1:50:15.600 --> 1:50:16.640]  that did not work.
[1:50:16.640 --> 1:50:18.320]  We need to avoid their mistakes.
[1:50:18.320 --> 1:50:21.880]  We need to go through our own equivalent of kicking out the oligarchs and putting our
[1:50:21.880 --> 1:50:24.320]  nation back on a solid financial track.
[1:50:24.320 --> 1:50:29.040]  Look how quickly Putin managed to pay off Russia's debt once they had a working economy
[1:50:29.040 --> 1:50:31.960]  that wasn't burdened with centuries of reckless debt.
[1:50:31.960 --> 1:50:32.960]  Let's get this straight.
[1:50:32.960 --> 1:50:33.960]  He's not perfect.
[1:50:33.960 --> 1:50:34.960]  We're certainly not.
[1:50:34.960 --> 1:50:40.240]  But the point is, exactly, if we debate liberal conservative, nothing's ever going to happen.
[1:50:40.240 --> 1:50:41.680]  You must kick the bankers out.
[1:50:41.680 --> 1:50:42.680]  You must arrest them.
[1:50:42.680 --> 1:50:43.880]  They're the real government.
[1:50:43.880 --> 1:50:45.840]  You must end the Fed.
[1:50:45.840 --> 1:50:48.440]  Anything else is cosmetic, and that's the, stay there, Mike, I want to get your take
[1:50:48.440 --> 1:50:49.440]  on that when we get back.
[1:50:49.440 --> 1:50:52.600]  Two more seconds with Mike Rivera, jamming a few of your phone calls.
[1:50:52.600 --> 1:50:56.440]  We got the Camp FEMA folks coming up with big developments on that front.
[1:50:56.440 --> 1:50:57.440]  Stay with us.
[1:50:57.440 --> 1:51:06.040]  E-cigarettesnational.com would like to introduce an alternative to smoking regular cigarettes
[1:51:06.040 --> 1:51:07.960]  to all GCN listeners.
[1:51:07.960 --> 1:51:09.600]  It's called the E-cigarette.
[1:51:09.600 --> 1:51:14.240]  It looks, feels, tastes, and delivers nicotine like a regular cigarette.
[1:51:14.240 --> 1:51:19.240]  But because this is not a cigarette, you don't have to worry about more than 3,900 toxic
[1:51:19.240 --> 1:51:21.960]  chemicals and tar entering your body.
[1:51:21.960 --> 1:51:22.960]  There's no flame.
[1:51:22.960 --> 1:51:26.720]  So there's no risk of fire and has no dangerous secondhand smoke.
[1:51:26.720 --> 1:51:31.520]  So it's safe for the people around you and will save you right around 50% over smoking
[1:51:31.520 --> 1:51:33.000]  regular cigarettes.

[1:52:00.480 --> 1:52:03.080]  May I have everyone's attention, please?
[1:52:03.080 --> 1:52:08.000]  I've come with a message of information, 9-11 was an inside job.
[1:52:08.000 --> 1:52:09.560]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[1:52:09.560 --> 1:52:11.160]  Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[1:52:11.160 --> 1:52:15.720]  I'll do the American people know that 9-11 was a state, it was engineered by you, David
[1:52:15.720 --> 1:52:20.320]  Rockefeller, the Thrallateral Commission, the CFR, the UNICEF, and I'm shut up.
[1:52:20.320 --> 1:52:25.560]  The day that we stop asking questions is the day that we have allowed the seeds of despotism
[1:52:25.560 --> 1:52:27.320]  to grow at our own door.
[1:52:27.320 --> 1:52:32.720]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11, a global awakening has taken place.
[1:52:32.720 --> 1:52:36.080]  An inside job?
[1:52:36.080 --> 1:52:37.080]  How dare you?
[1:52:37.080 --> 1:52:43.640]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[1:52:43.640 --> 1:52:46.240]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[1:52:46.240 --> 1:52:50.720]  And if the government has not told the truth in five years, we will be here on the 10th
[1:52:50.720 --> 1:52:51.720]  anniversary of 9-11.
[1:52:51.720 --> 1:52:52.720]  Truth rising.

[1:53:01.240 --> 1:53:04.720]  Berkey water systems are the most trusted name and water filtration available on the
[1:53:04.720 --> 1:53:05.720]  market.
[1:53:05.720 --> 1:53:09.640]  In addition, ordinary Berkey lights, self-sterilizing and recleanable purification elements purify
[1:53:09.640 --> 1:53:14.840]  water by removing pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites to non-detectable levels and
[1:53:14.840 --> 1:53:21.240]  by extracting harmful chemicals such as herbicides, pesticides, VOCs, organic solvents, radon-222,
[1:53:21.240 --> 1:53:22.240]  and trihalomethane.
[1:53:22.240 --> 1:53:27.560]  They also reduce nitrates, nitrites, sediment, and unhealthy minerals such as lead and mercury.

[1:54:04.640 --> 1:54:22.720]  Mike, I want to take some calls in a couple of seconds we've got left with you, but just
[1:54:22.720 --> 1:54:29.240]  briefly going back to the flu.
[1:54:29.240 --> 1:54:32.760]  I mean we know it's a fraud, we know it's a moneymaker, we know the UN's using it as
[1:54:32.760 --> 1:54:34.560]  a way to test global government.
[1:54:34.560 --> 1:54:39.760]  They bragged and said that the whole world under UN command on the flu response to the
[1:54:39.760 --> 1:54:43.920]  level six that they issue when it's not even really a level six with a number of cases
[1:54:43.920 --> 1:54:45.840]  or deaths.
[1:54:45.840 --> 1:54:50.560]  What do you think the overall motive, I mean was it just profit and power grab or do you
[1:54:50.560 --> 1:54:55.720]  think in your spidey sense they're planning to really go wild with this and really release
[1:54:55.720 --> 1:55:00.400]  something more deadly or do they know the nasal spray live virus is going to mutate?
[1:55:00.400 --> 1:55:03.360]  They say they know it is, but do they know it's going to mutate into something really
[1:55:03.360 --> 1:55:04.360]  bad?
[1:55:04.360 --> 1:55:07.200]  I mean there are a bunch of eugenicists that say they want to kill us.
[1:55:07.200 --> 1:55:10.280]  Could this be their global crisis, 100 million people dead?
[1:55:10.280 --> 1:55:14.480]  Well, I think they're definitely trying to create a global crisis in order to justify
[1:55:14.480 --> 1:55:16.480]  the bringing on of global government.
[1:55:16.480 --> 1:55:20.080]  They wanted to do that with global warming, human-caused global warming.
[1:55:20.080 --> 1:55:23.600]  The idea being that if there was a global environmental crisis it had to have a global
[1:55:23.600 --> 1:55:25.200]  controlling authority.
[1:55:25.200 --> 1:55:30.000]  That one fell flat on its face because the earth is actually getting cooler and the scientific
[1:55:30.000 --> 1:55:33.960]  underpinnings of human-caused global warming have basically all been destroyed over the
[1:55:33.960 --> 1:55:35.440]  last couple of years.
[1:55:35.440 --> 1:55:39.400]  So okay, global warming isn't going to work, let's come up with a new crisis.
[1:55:39.400 --> 1:55:41.320]  It's the Hegelian dialectic all over again.
[1:55:41.320 --> 1:55:46.200]  They're looking to create a global crisis of some kind that will justify or at least
[1:55:46.200 --> 1:55:50.240]  sell to the people of the world the necessity for a global government, whether it's a global
[1:55:50.240 --> 1:55:56.200]  economic crash, a global flu pandemic, global warming, aliens invading, whatever they think
[1:55:56.200 --> 1:55:58.320]  is going to work, that's what they're going to do.
[1:55:58.320 --> 1:56:01.760]  By the way, that's declassified, as you just said, Project Bluebeam.
[1:56:01.760 --> 1:56:05.880]  They don't declassify the details, but they admit they've got a fake alien landing project
[1:56:05.880 --> 1:56:10.080]  to unify humanity with big hologram machines if they have to.
[1:56:10.080 --> 1:56:14.240]  But absolutely, they need a global crisis to offer their global solution.
[1:56:14.240 --> 1:56:18.400]  Their latest fear-mongering, I'm sure you saw from the UN, is carbon dioxide is going
[1:56:18.400 --> 1:56:21.320]  to make the ocean turn into acid.
[1:56:21.320 --> 1:56:22.320]  Yes.
[1:56:22.320 --> 1:56:27.120]  Well, technically it's already acid because it's carbonic acid, which is the same thing
[1:56:27.120 --> 1:56:33.080]  you have in mineral water, and so again, they're taking a minor scientific truth and they're
[1:56:33.080 --> 1:56:36.240]  blowing it up to be this big, scary threat.
[1:56:36.240 --> 1:56:40.480]  But the bottom line is that the Earth is always changing, the climate is always changing,
[1:56:40.480 --> 1:56:43.840]  the chemistry is always changing, it never stays the same.
[1:56:43.840 --> 1:56:48.160]  This idea that if there's a global government that we will lock the Earth in this particular
[1:56:48.160 --> 1:56:53.960]  configuration, at some arbitrary definition of what is ideal, is absolutely nonsense.
[1:56:53.960 --> 1:56:54.960]  It is artificial.
[1:56:54.960 --> 1:56:55.960]  Exactly.
[1:56:55.960 --> 1:56:56.960]  Let me throw this at you.
[1:56:56.960 --> 1:57:02.280]  People watch on HBO, Bill Marsh shows sometimes because they rear it all the time.
[1:57:02.280 --> 1:57:07.080]  Every show, he shows the wall fires in L.A. and says this is global warming when they've
[1:57:07.080 --> 1:57:10.920]  always had wall fires in L.A. and now I've talked to the police out there and it's on
[1:57:10.920 --> 1:57:18.480]  their news, crazy arsonist go and set fires everywhere and they have overbuilt out there
[1:57:18.480 --> 1:57:24.360]  and you've got people setting fires and then he showed a dust storm in Australia and said
[1:57:24.360 --> 1:57:25.720]  it was the end of the world.
[1:57:25.720 --> 1:57:30.280]  They've always had dust storms out of the interior of Australia.
[1:57:30.280 --> 1:57:37.080]  These guys will take a tornado, a tsunami, an earthquake, they're worse than Pat Robertson.
[1:57:37.080 --> 1:57:38.480]  They really are.
[1:57:38.480 --> 1:57:42.160]  Anything that happens, blame it on the villain that we're trying to solve the solution to
[1:57:42.160 --> 1:57:44.520]  and it's absolutely correct.
[1:57:44.520 --> 1:57:49.240]  The bottom line though is that the Earth is actually cooling and it's being driven by
[1:57:49.240 --> 1:57:50.480]  the sun.
[1:57:50.480 --> 1:57:54.800]  The actual forces involved in controlling the temperature of the Earth are so far beyond
[1:57:54.800 --> 1:57:58.800]  the capabilities of humans to deal with or adjust or influence.
[1:57:58.800 --> 1:58:04.360]  It's just another excuse to sell us another governmental control, to sell us another tax,
[1:58:04.360 --> 1:58:07.680]  to take more money from us, to control our lives even more.
[1:58:07.680 --> 1:58:08.680]  Leave us alone.
[1:58:08.680 --> 1:58:11.540]  That's the message from the people of planet Earth to the globalists.
[1:58:11.540 --> 1:58:12.540]  Leave us alone.
[1:58:12.540 --> 1:58:15.720]  Go conquer Mars if you want to rule a planet.
[1:58:15.720 --> 1:58:16.720]  Go bother them.
[1:58:16.720 --> 1:58:17.720]  Leave us alone.
[1:58:17.720 --> 1:58:22.920]  Well you know the thing is I know 300 Earths will fit in Jupiter.
[1:58:22.920 --> 1:58:25.800]  Google the term, how many Earths will fit in the sun.
[1:58:25.800 --> 1:58:29.320]  You've got this giant fireball, I think it's several thousand.
[1:58:29.320 --> 1:58:33.040]  You've got this giant fireball that burns your skin.
[1:58:33.040 --> 1:58:36.200]  If you're out in it too much and they're saying, oh that has nothing to do, the UN officially
[1:58:36.200 --> 1:58:38.960]  says nothing to do with the climate.
[1:58:38.960 --> 1:58:39.960]  Yeah.
[1:58:39.960 --> 1:58:40.960]  Yeah.
[1:58:40.960 --> 1:58:50.800]  You are listening to GCN, visit GCNLive.com today.
[1:58:50.800 --> 1:58:51.800]  Hello friends.
[1:58:51.800 --> 1:58:54.640]  I'm Alex Jones and I want each of you to ask yourself this question.
[1:58:54.640 --> 1:58:57.000]  Do you really know what's in your tap water?
[1:58:57.000 --> 1:59:02.620]  In a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor, they found that over 260 chemicals
[1:59:02.620 --> 1:59:05.640]  in pollutants are present in municipal drinking water.
[1:59:05.640 --> 1:59:09.760]  Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive, immune, and developmental
[1:59:09.760 --> 1:59:11.080]  system diseases.
[1:59:11.080 --> 1:59:12.940]  Now what are you going to do about it?
[1:59:12.940 --> 1:59:17.680]  The Acola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator is a low-cost way to take back control of
[1:59:17.680 --> 1:59:19.440]  you and your family's drinking water.
[1:59:19.440 --> 1:59:24.200]  The Acola Blue 28 produces up to seven gallons of water from the humidity in the atmosphere
[1:59:24.200 --> 1:59:29.720]  and uses state-of-the-art carbon filtration, reverse osmosis, and ultra-violent light sterilization
[1:59:29.720 --> 1:59:30.720]  techniques.
[1:59:30.720 --> 1:59:31.720]  That's right.
[1:59:31.720 --> 1:59:33.960]  Clean water right from the air you breathe.

[1:59:48.640 --> 2:00:05.440]  Waging war on corruption, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[2:00:05.440 --> 2:00:10.240]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[2:00:10.240 --> 2:00:11.240]  You want answers?
[2:00:11.240 --> 2:00:13.400]  Well, so does he.
[2:00:13.400 --> 2:00:21.680]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network, and now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[2:00:21.680 --> 2:00:27.120]  I know you can fit 3,000 Earths in Jupiter, so we looked up the number.
[2:00:27.120 --> 2:00:35.200]  It's 1,206,885 Earths will fit inside the Sun.
[2:00:35.200 --> 2:00:43.680]  Like hydrogen thermal nuclear explosion fireball, it shoots off sunspot eruptions, thousands
[2:00:43.680 --> 2:00:49.240]  of times the size of the Earth, every day, if you're out there and just the radiation
[2:00:49.240 --> 2:00:53.480]  of a solar flare will hit you, it'll fry you in your space suit, dutter in a hammer,
[2:00:53.480 --> 2:00:57.600]  and they get on the news, and I've got it in the official UN documents, and they say,
[2:00:57.600 --> 2:01:02.720]  the Sun has nothing to do with the climate.
[2:01:02.720 --> 2:01:06.640]  And they also tell you polar bears can't swim and show them out on ice floes where
[2:01:06.640 --> 2:01:08.080]  they hunt for seals.
[2:01:08.080 --> 2:01:12.920]  Folks, they treat you like you're your complete moron, okay?
[2:01:12.920 --> 2:01:17.120]  There's nothing we can do to affect climate change like the Sun.
[2:01:17.120 --> 2:01:18.120]  Carbon dioxide.
[2:01:18.120 --> 2:01:21.960]  Mike, have you been seeing the ads on TV saying, watch out, carbon dioxide's deadly
[2:01:21.960 --> 2:01:22.960]  poison?
[2:01:22.960 --> 2:01:24.880]  I mean, how dumb do they think the public is?
[2:01:24.880 --> 2:01:28.760]  Well, they apparently think the public are very, very dumb, and the bottom line is that
[2:01:28.760 --> 2:01:33.080]  right now the Sun is showing hardly any sunspots at all, which means it's actually cooler
[2:01:33.080 --> 2:01:34.240]  than normal.
[2:01:34.240 --> 2:01:37.480]  And one thing that we have discovered from all these spacecraft that we've sent to other
[2:01:37.480 --> 2:01:42.320]  planets like we sent Viking to Mars back in 1976, and we've had all these spacecraft
[2:01:42.320 --> 2:01:47.080]  out there, and we have documented many, many times that the other planets are heating up
[2:01:47.080 --> 2:01:52.640]  and cooling down exactly the same time as Earth is in the same amounts, and it's obviously
[2:01:52.640 --> 2:01:55.960]  the only common factor is the solar radiation here.
[2:01:55.960 --> 2:02:01.040]  Now we already know that when Al Gore did his famous little graph showing Earth's temperature
[2:02:01.040 --> 2:02:05.700]  related to carbon dioxide, that he actually got them backward, that the Earth's temperature
[2:02:05.700 --> 2:02:10.920]  went up first, then there was more carbon dioxide, because warmer water was giving
[2:02:10.920 --> 2:02:15.080]  up its carbon dioxide for the same reason that warm soda pop does, and as the Earth
[2:02:15.080 --> 2:02:19.040]  got warmer, there was more life, life produced, more carbon dioxide.
[2:02:19.040 --> 2:02:21.240]  So the linkage is actually the reverse of what Al Gore-
[2:02:21.240 --> 2:02:23.920]  Now let me stop you for people that don't know.
[2:02:23.920 --> 2:02:28.560]  He, knowingly, because all the ice cores, all the climatologists, it's on record that
[2:02:28.560 --> 2:02:34.400]  carbon dioxide, because the H2O's part CO2, when the Earth heats up, then more carbon
[2:02:34.400 --> 2:02:39.280]  dioxide comes out, then that accelerates plant life, more oxygen, that's a blooming
[2:02:39.280 --> 2:02:40.440]  for the Earth.
[2:02:40.440 --> 2:02:43.960]  It's very hard on the Earth when it's cold for overall biomass.
[2:02:43.960 --> 2:02:50.160]  They knew all of that and just lied about it, and it's just like you leave a Coca-Cola
[2:02:50.160 --> 2:02:55.120]  in a can in your hot car, it's going to explode, because the CO2 rises in the heat.
[2:02:55.120 --> 2:02:59.440]  Al Gore knows that, he didn't invent the Internet, he told you Naft and Gatt were going to be
[2:02:59.440 --> 2:03:01.240]  great, they weren't, were they Mike?
[2:03:01.240 --> 2:03:05.760]  No, they absolutely weren't, and just to show you how much, the reason why I think this
[2:03:05.760 --> 2:03:09.440]  global warming hype was linked to the push for a global government is look, they gave
[2:03:09.440 --> 2:03:13.320]  them the Nobel Peace Prize, they gave him all these film awards to say what a wonderful
[2:03:13.320 --> 2:03:18.880]  documentary it was, it's a hard sell, hard sell, hard sell, to sell you the lie that
[2:03:18.880 --> 2:03:23.560]  you are to blame for the reason the planet is getting worse and therefore you must submit
[2:03:23.560 --> 2:03:28.680]  to global control and global taxation in order to atone for your sins.
[2:03:28.680 --> 2:03:32.240]  That's what the agenda was there, and since that's not working out and people aren't
[2:03:32.240 --> 2:03:35.620]  falling for the global warming anymore, they're switching over to the swine flu and global
[2:03:35.620 --> 2:03:41.040]  financial crisis, the goal is a global government and they're going to use any excuse they can
[2:03:41.040 --> 2:03:42.560]  come up with.
[2:03:42.560 --> 2:03:46.840]  But how can they say if the sun is obviously the source of most heat on this planet, there's
[2:03:46.840 --> 2:03:51.960]  some that comes out of the tectonic plates, the thermal from the volcanic activity in
[2:03:51.960 --> 2:03:57.080]  the core of the earth, you know, up into the mammal and the crust, but I mean, it's just
[2:03:57.080 --> 2:04:02.800]  so asinine to say polar bears can't swim and the sun isn't hating us, I mean, and it's
[2:04:02.800 --> 2:04:06.840]  like when I had Rothschild on, I said that they had environmental land grabber, and
[2:04:06.840 --> 2:04:13.880]  I said, but Jupiter and Saturn's moons are melting, the ice caps of Mars are melting,
[2:04:13.880 --> 2:04:17.280]  this was three years ago, now they're getting bigger, and he just said, well, that's because
[2:04:17.280 --> 2:04:22.000]  Jupiter, Saturn and Mars are closer to the sun than the earth, and I said no, it's Mercury
[2:04:22.000 --> 2:04:26.880]  and then Venus and then Earth, he said no, no, they're closer, and he just laughed because
[2:04:26.880 --> 2:04:31.480]  he knows the, he thinks the general audience is like, my audience is like the general public,
[2:04:31.480 --> 2:04:35.600]  he thought if he just acted confident and said that Saturn was the closest to the sun,
[2:04:35.600 --> 2:04:36.600]  people believe it.
[2:04:36.600 --> 2:04:41.280]  Well, like I said, there, these, these guys grew up in the height of the Cold War where
[2:04:41.280 --> 2:04:45.240]  they could lie to the public with impunity and there was no blogosphere or alternative
[2:04:45.240 --> 2:04:48.160]  radio to challenge them.
[2:04:48.160 --> 2:04:51.920]  Mike, let me talk to you here in the break, we've got the Camp Fima folks coming up, Mike
[2:04:51.920 --> 2:04:57.160]  Rivera, WhatWeHappen.com, I'm Alex Jones of EmpollWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com, the
[2:04:57.160 --> 2:05:00.640]  new film is pre-sale right now, ships out on her before the 21st.
[2:05:00.640 --> 2:05:03.960]  Have you ever wanted to generate your own supply of electrical power?
[2:05:03.960 --> 2:05:08.640]  If so, this is going to be the most important message you will ever hear, solar-powered generators
[2:05:08.640 --> 2:05:12.240]  are now available from Solutions from Science in Thompson, Illinois.
[2:05:12.240 --> 2:05:16.720]  These emergency backup systems provide life-saving electrical power when you need it most.
[2:05:16.720 --> 2:05:21.880]  Unlike gas generators, a solar generator runs quietly, emits no fumes and produces electricity
[2:05:21.880 --> 2:05:22.880]  for free.
[2:05:22.880 --> 2:05:26.520]  It's like having an electric power plant running quietly in your own home.
[2:05:26.520 --> 2:05:31.400]  Run some pumps, shortwave radios, computers, and even keep food from spoiling.
[2:05:31.400 --> 2:05:35.760]  Whether it's hurricanes, ice storms, brownouts or blackouts, you'll never have to suffer
[2:05:35.760 --> 2:05:40.320]  through painful power outages again, when the power goes out, you'll be ready.
[2:05:40.320 --> 2:05:46.200]  With a solar-powered generator from Solutions from Science, go to mysolarbackup.com and
[2:05:46.200 --> 2:05:48.080]  get off the grid today.
[2:05:48.080 --> 2:06:00.920]  That's mysolarbackup.com or call 877-327-0365, 877-327-0365, don't wait, call today.
[2:06:00.920 --> 2:06:05.000]  Have you heard that millionaire, entrepreneur, businessman, your congressional candidate
[2:06:05.000 --> 2:06:08.600]  and author Robert Beatles wrote a new book called Here's What You Do.
[2:06:08.600 --> 2:06:14.720]  You can buy it at HereIsWhatYouDo.net as an e-book for 6 bucks or the book for 10 bucks.
[2:06:14.720 --> 2:06:17.560]  And we have an audiobook on its way for you commuters as well.
[2:06:17.560 --> 2:06:22.640]  Here's What You Do tells you exactly what to do to survive and thrive in these harsh
[2:06:22.640 --> 2:06:23.960]  economic times.
[2:06:23.960 --> 2:06:28.040]  This book will work for anyone, rich, poor, middle class, it doesn't matter.
[2:06:28.040 --> 2:06:32.520]  This book truly has the information that can make you wealthy and will tell you how to protect
[2:06:32.520 --> 2:06:33.600]  your wealth as well.
[2:06:33.600 --> 2:06:35.720]  You know the government isn't looking out for you.
[2:06:35.720 --> 2:06:37.440]  You need to look out for yourself.
[2:06:37.440 --> 2:06:39.960]  The economy is bad, but it's probably going to get worse.
[2:06:39.960 --> 2:06:43.800]  You must prepare and make sure you are able to financially take care of yourself and your
[2:06:43.800 --> 2:06:44.800]  loved ones.
[2:06:44.800 --> 2:06:48.280]  Go to HereIsWhatYouDo.net and start today.
[2:06:48.280 --> 2:06:51.600]  Again, it is HereIsWhatYouDo.net.
[2:06:51.600 --> 2:06:53.440]  That's HereIsWhatYouDo.net.
[2:06:53.440 --> 2:07:01.120]  One last time, it's HereIsWhatYouDo.net.
[2:07:01.120 --> 2:07:04.160]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[2:07:04.160 --> 2:07:08.520]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition
[2:07:08.520 --> 2:07:09.520]  do you want?
[2:07:09.520 --> 2:07:11.520]  My answer would be all I can get.
[2:07:11.520 --> 2:07:16.520]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[2:07:16.520 --> 2:07:17.760]  How much do you want?
[2:07:17.760 --> 2:07:18.760]  When do you want it?
[2:07:18.760 --> 2:07:20.800]  Now or after the battle starts.
[2:07:20.800 --> 2:07:21.920]  When will you need it?
[2:07:21.920 --> 2:07:24.040]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[2:07:24.040 --> 2:07:25.400]  Will there be any food?
[2:07:25.400 --> 2:07:26.840]  Will it make your children sick?
[2:07:26.840 --> 2:07:30.960]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center
[2:07:30.960 --> 2:07:32.120]  and be immunized?
[2:07:32.120 --> 2:07:35.920]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[2:07:35.920 --> 2:07:39.520]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[2:07:39.520 --> 2:07:40.760]  How much will you need?
[2:07:40.760 --> 2:07:41.760]  We don't know.
[2:07:41.760 --> 2:07:42.760]  How much do you want?
[2:07:42.760 --> 2:07:43.760]  All you can get.
[2:07:43.760 --> 2:07:44.760]  I'm Alex Jones.
[2:07:44.760 --> 2:07:47.800]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[2:07:47.800 --> 2:07:55.320]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at eFoodsDirect.com.
[2:07:55.320 --> 2:08:05.840]  And begin that number, 1-800-409-5633.
[2:08:05.840 --> 2:08:10.640]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[2:08:10.640 --> 2:08:11.640]  You want answers?
[2:08:11.640 --> 2:08:13.760]  Well, so does he.
[2:08:13.760 --> 2:08:30.560]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network, and now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[2:08:30.560 --> 2:08:31.560]  We are back live.
[2:08:31.560 --> 2:08:38.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for joining us today.
[2:08:38.000 --> 2:08:41.440]  Coming up for the balance of the hour and to the next hour, to the next segment, we're
[2:08:41.440 --> 2:08:46.320]  going to have the makers of Camp Femon talk about a host of issues, get into the flu,
[2:08:46.320 --> 2:08:51.040]  get into big developments with the hardened Montana American police force situation.
[2:08:51.040 --> 2:08:55.560]  I haven't gotten to that yet, biggest developments yet in that case, but I wanted to hold Mike
[2:08:55.560 --> 2:08:57.520]  over to take some calls.
[2:08:57.520 --> 2:08:59.320]  Jasper and Mass, you're on the air.
[2:08:59.320 --> 2:09:00.320]  Go ahead.
[2:09:00.320 --> 2:09:01.320]  Thanks for holding.
[2:09:01.320 --> 2:09:02.320]  Hey, Alex.
[2:09:02.320 --> 2:09:03.320]  You hear me okay?
[2:09:03.320 --> 2:09:04.320]  Yes, sir.
[2:09:04.320 --> 2:09:10.240]  Hey, listen, I think I've got breaking news that you'd be really interested in.
[2:09:10.240 --> 2:09:18.200]  We were looking on YouTube this morning and we found these clips that talk about NASA
[2:09:18.200 --> 2:09:21.760]  sending a bomb to the moon.
[2:09:21.760 --> 2:09:22.760]  Have you heard of that?
[2:09:22.760 --> 2:09:23.760]  Yeah, that's public.
[2:09:23.760 --> 2:09:25.240]  That's Reuters, AP.
[2:09:25.240 --> 2:09:26.240]  Right.
[2:09:26.240 --> 2:09:31.840]  Since the Indian probe a few months ago found water all over the entire contiguous surface,
[2:09:31.840 --> 2:09:37.000]  even above the surface in the dust, below the surface in large amounts, NASA's quickest
[2:09:37.000 --> 2:09:41.440]  thing they can do is to slam, they're calling it a bomb in the headlines, slam a satellite
[2:09:41.440 --> 2:09:48.000]  into it to then have spectrometers from a distance scan the water content because they
[2:09:48.000 --> 2:09:51.040]  want to find out the concentrations below ground.
[2:09:51.040 --> 2:09:52.320]  And so, yes, it's very interesting.
[2:09:52.320 --> 2:09:53.320]  That's in my stack.
[2:09:53.320 --> 2:09:59.080]  Could this be the false flag because remember, well, first of all, I wanted to point out
[2:09:59.080 --> 2:10:10.160]  that the date is essentially 1-9-9, which was pretty close to 9-1-1, and it's illegal
[2:10:10.160 --> 2:10:15.680]  to be doing any kind of weaponization stuff in space, so I thought there was a ban on
[2:10:15.680 --> 2:10:17.000]  that.
[2:10:17.000 --> 2:10:25.440]  And then additionally, could this be the false flag event that they have always been talking
[2:10:25.440 --> 2:10:32.360]  about that Vaughn Brun was talking about, saying that the alien threat would come after
[2:10:32.360 --> 2:10:33.960]  the terrorist threat?
[2:10:33.960 --> 2:10:37.640]  Listen, I appreciate your call, sir.
[2:10:37.640 --> 2:10:39.960]  I don't get into speculation here.
[2:10:39.960 --> 2:10:41.320]  We know it's a live virus.
[2:10:41.320 --> 2:10:46.000]  They pump into the nasal cavity with the new flu vaccine and that it can mutate and spread
[2:10:46.000 --> 2:10:47.000]  the disease.
[2:10:47.000 --> 2:10:48.640]  We're covering it.
[2:10:48.640 --> 2:10:52.400]  We know a convicted felon fraud moved in and tried to take over a detention facility
[2:10:52.400 --> 2:10:56.880]  where they were talking about keeping terror suspects.
[2:10:56.880 --> 2:11:01.680]  We know that 23.7 trillions have been stolen from the people of this country in the last
[2:11:01.680 --> 2:11:06.440]  year.
[2:11:06.440 --> 2:11:08.560]  We know all this is happening.
[2:11:08.560 --> 2:11:12.680]  It's the wrong show, and I don't bash people that get off into different things.
[2:11:12.680 --> 2:11:18.440]  I even knew about the water on the moon through Buzz Aldrin, through Charlie Sheen before
[2:11:18.440 --> 2:11:19.440]  it was even in the news.
[2:11:19.440 --> 2:11:22.520]  I didn't even mention that because it would just sound weird.
[2:11:22.520 --> 2:11:25.640]  Buzz Aldrin says they're going to announce in the next month they found water on it.
[2:11:25.640 --> 2:11:29.760]  I told my wife about it, a few people around the office, and got some text messages from
[2:11:29.760 --> 2:11:31.200]  Charlie about it.
[2:11:31.200 --> 2:11:36.800]  But the point is, is that I just don't get off into all that.
[2:11:36.800 --> 2:11:37.800]  Mike Rivera.
[2:11:37.800 --> 2:11:41.200]  Well, I mean, this is not weaponization.
[2:11:41.200 --> 2:11:46.960]  This is a repeat of what they did with the comet impact or mission, and it's becoming
[2:11:46.960 --> 2:11:48.320]  a standardized technique.
[2:11:48.320 --> 2:11:53.640]  You throw a large object into the celestial body you're investigating, and as you said
[2:11:53.640 --> 2:11:58.680]  correctly, you use a spectroscope on the debris to see what came out of the center.
[2:11:58.680 --> 2:12:03.640]  This is a precursor to a possible permanent lunar base at the Moon's South Pole, where
[2:12:03.640 --> 2:12:08.440]  if there is a source of water there underneath the regolith, it's going to make the logistics
[2:12:08.440 --> 2:12:10.880]  of supporting such a base that much easier.
[2:12:10.880 --> 2:12:12.040]  It's not a false flag.
[2:12:12.040 --> 2:12:13.160]  It's not weaponization.
[2:12:13.160 --> 2:12:18.520]  It's just the next step in establishing a permanent lunar colony.
[2:12:18.520 --> 2:12:19.520]  Absolutely.
[2:12:19.520 --> 2:12:20.520]  A false flag.
[2:12:20.520 --> 2:12:26.400]  I mean, having a satellite, a little satellite, not that big of a satellite, slam in as a
[2:12:26.400 --> 2:12:31.720]  meteor gun into the surface of the Moon so they can register how much water vapor comes
[2:12:31.720 --> 2:12:32.720]  up.
[2:12:32.720 --> 2:12:33.720]  I mean, that's not a false flag.
[2:12:33.720 --> 2:12:36.960]  But I'm not trying to make enemies with listeners disagreeing with you.
[2:12:36.960 --> 2:12:42.280]  I just, you know, I got so much stuff here I can prove it's off the charts insane and
[2:12:42.280 --> 2:12:46.840]  nobody seems to care what the White House science are has written more than 10 textbooks
[2:12:46.840 --> 2:12:50.160]  calling for the extermination of the majority of the public and forced drugging of the water
[2:12:50.160 --> 2:12:52.560]  supply to sterilize us.
[2:12:52.560 --> 2:12:57.080]  But I can get plenty of people to call in and tell me about reptoids, and I'm not bashing
[2:12:57.080 --> 2:12:59.480]  the people that think everybody's a reptoid.
[2:12:59.480 --> 2:13:00.920]  The point is just that isn't me.
[2:13:00.920 --> 2:13:02.280]  I'm not into that.
[2:13:02.280 --> 2:13:04.440]  I'm just into what I can prove.
[2:13:04.440 --> 2:13:06.320]  Let's go ahead and talk to Joe and Marilyn.
[2:13:06.320 --> 2:13:07.320]  You're on the air.
[2:13:07.320 --> 2:13:08.320]  Go ahead.
[2:13:08.320 --> 2:13:09.320]  Hey, Alex.
[2:13:09.320 --> 2:13:10.320]  How you doing?
[2:13:10.320 --> 2:13:11.320]  Good, buddy.
[2:13:11.320 --> 2:13:18.520]  Hey, I used to work for a wholesale store, and it's called Costco, talking about the North
[2:13:18.520 --> 2:13:19.520]  American Union.
[2:13:19.520 --> 2:13:27.560]  And the meat boxes, and the meat labels, and the meat wrapper labels, they said product
[2:13:27.560 --> 2:13:31.160]  of U.S., Canada, and Mexico.
[2:13:31.160 --> 2:13:40.040]  And sometimes they'll say Canada and Mexico, and then sometimes they'll say product of
[2:13:40.040 --> 2:13:41.920]  North America.
[2:13:41.920 --> 2:13:49.040]  Well, I mean, I remember two years ago I got the letter, because I have employees in Texas
[2:13:49.040 --> 2:13:54.400]  from the Texas Workforce Commission saying, you will no longer report your employee data
[2:13:54.400 --> 2:14:00.160]  in workers comp, all that kind of stuff to the Bureau of National Statistics, to the Labor
[2:14:00.160 --> 2:14:05.280]  Department through us, you will report it to the North American Union.
[2:14:05.280 --> 2:14:07.640]  And it gave me my North American Union ID number.
[2:14:07.640 --> 2:14:12.360]  And then it's one of those things where it happened so close to home, I didn't even cover
[2:14:12.360 --> 2:14:13.360]  it for a few weeks.
[2:14:13.360 --> 2:14:15.840]  I didn't, it was so weird.
[2:14:15.840 --> 2:14:20.280]  My wife just pointed it out, and then Jerome Corsi at Human Events and WorldNet Daily did
[2:14:20.280 --> 2:14:22.760]  report on it separately, people noticed.
[2:14:22.760 --> 2:14:26.720]  So Mike Rivera, comments on that, I mean, that's all this is, is being conquered.
[2:14:26.720 --> 2:14:30.440]  Yeah, private banks come in, they announce new government agencies, they rewrite the
[2:14:30.440 --> 2:14:35.160]  laws in a tyrannical way, so they control everything, and that's it.
[2:14:35.160 --> 2:14:39.760]  Yeah, basically that's it, and that's the reason the first two United States central
[2:14:39.760 --> 2:14:44.720]  banks were shut down by courageous presidents who had more gonadal tissue than our current
[2:14:44.720 --> 2:14:46.480]  administration.
[2:14:46.480 --> 2:14:51.520]  And every time there has been a central bank privately owned, it has brought hardship and
[2:14:51.520 --> 2:14:57.000]  impoverishment to the American people, you know, when Ben Franklin was serving as ambassador
[2:14:57.000 --> 2:15:00.800]  to the Court of St. James for the colonies, and they said, what do you do with all your
[2:15:00.800 --> 2:15:01.800]  poor and unemployed?
[2:15:01.800 --> 2:15:04.600]  And he said, we don't have poor and unemployed, there's enough money around for everybody
[2:15:04.600 --> 2:15:08.800]  to have jobs and be carrying on their commerce, and immediately the Bank of England went to
[2:15:08.800 --> 2:15:13.480]  King George III and lobbied him to pass a currency act saying that the colonies had
[2:15:13.480 --> 2:15:16.440]  to conform to the banking practices of the Bank of England.
[2:15:16.440 --> 2:15:20.400]  Two years later, there was massive poverty, massive unemployment, and that was where the
[2:15:20.400 --> 2:15:22.920]  anger for the American Revolution really came from.
[2:15:22.920 --> 2:15:27.000]  Forget about the Stamp Act and the T-tax and all the rest of it, it was that deliberate
[2:15:27.000 --> 2:15:31.240]  impoverishment by a private bank that fueled the first American Revolution, and I think
[2:15:31.240 --> 2:15:34.320]  it might fuel the second.
[2:15:34.320 --> 2:15:39.720]  You're absolutely right, Mike Rivera, let's go ahead and take another call.
[2:15:39.720 --> 2:15:43.160]  I guess Kenny in Texas is up next, or is it Matthew?
[2:15:43.160 --> 2:15:44.160]  Kenny, welcome.
[2:15:44.160 --> 2:15:45.160]  How are you doing?
[2:15:45.160 --> 2:15:46.160]  I'm a big fan, Alex.
[2:15:46.160 --> 2:15:52.760]  I just wanted to call because I kind of had an event the other day, and I just wanted
[2:15:52.760 --> 2:15:55.240]  to let you know about it.
[2:15:55.240 --> 2:16:02.280]  I stumbled into a volunteer firefighter, and he's FEMA certified through a bunch of different
[2:16:02.280 --> 2:16:10.720]  things, and he has been practicing with the Gallupin County Office of Emergency Management,
[2:16:10.720 --> 2:16:16.280]  and he showed me one of these bracelets that you all were talking about, these bracelets
[2:16:16.280 --> 2:16:18.280]  with this RFID card.
[2:16:18.280 --> 2:16:19.840]  Yeah, we weren't doing that.
[2:16:19.840 --> 2:16:25.240]  It was a medical person with the Army saying they're training with the chips in California,
[2:16:25.240 --> 2:16:29.640]  the Highway Patrol, to do this, and then we confirmed in the UN documents they are preparing
[2:16:29.640 --> 2:16:34.160]  that, and they've since admitted they're preparing for mass quarantines and lockdowns.
[2:16:34.160 --> 2:16:36.280]  That doesn't mean they're going to do it, they're just preparing for it.
[2:16:36.280 --> 2:16:42.800]  I want to make that clear distinction there, but go ahead.
[2:16:42.800 --> 2:16:46.840]  Yeah, I didn't really, I mean, whenever you all were talking about bracelets, it was kind
[2:16:46.840 --> 2:16:51.040]  of, you know, I didn't really believe it, or not that I didn't believe it, but I just
[2:16:51.040 --> 2:16:57.480]  didn't know how it worked, and I went to the Gallupin County Office of Emergency website,
[2:16:57.480 --> 2:17:01.680]  and they're showing little kids putting on these bracelets on the website.
[2:17:01.680 --> 2:17:02.680]  Excuse me?
[2:17:02.680 --> 2:17:06.840]  Now, now I want to put you on hold, I want you to send this to an email address we're
[2:17:06.840 --> 2:17:08.840]  going to give you.
[2:17:08.840 --> 2:17:12.040]  What's the best one to give him off there that's a direct line to us?
[2:17:12.040 --> 2:17:17.040]  John, John, John, give him Hartman's email.
[2:17:17.040 --> 2:17:21.360]  For the, so this is the Gallupin County Office of Emergency Management, it shows them getting
[2:17:21.360 --> 2:17:23.520]  the bracelets that they've had, had the shots.
[2:17:23.520 --> 2:17:30.440]  No, not that they've had the shots, but that they're, I guess, and it's got the Boy Scouts
[2:17:30.440 --> 2:17:32.440]  earned emergency merit badge.
[2:17:32.440 --> 2:17:34.360]  Can I talk about merit badges?
[2:17:34.360 --> 2:17:36.840]  You said bracelets, what are they getting bracelets for?
[2:17:36.840 --> 2:17:44.440]  Well, I think they're just doing some kind of drill, putting the bracelets on, I don't,
[2:17:44.440 --> 2:17:49.720]  they're not getting the shot, they're just maybe practicing for an awareness, I'm not
[2:17:49.720 --> 2:17:50.720]  really sure.
[2:17:50.720 --> 2:17:52.720]  Well, what does it say?
[2:17:52.720 --> 2:17:53.720]  Okay.
[2:17:53.720 --> 2:18:00.360]  All right, so that's the Galveston, that's the Galveston Office of Emergency Management.
[2:18:00.360 --> 2:18:02.240]  What does the header on the article say?
[2:18:02.240 --> 2:18:07.280]  New technology assist with evacuee tracking, that's what they're saying they're using before.
[2:18:07.280 --> 2:18:11.240]  Oh yeah, they did say in Texas when you're in evacuee they want to make you take a bracelet.
[2:18:11.240 --> 2:18:13.920]  Yeah, no, I saw that with Rick Perry six months ago.
[2:18:13.920 --> 2:18:17.520]  Okay, so new technology helps with evacuee preparedness.
[2:18:17.520 --> 2:18:18.520]  Is that it?
[2:18:18.520 --> 2:18:19.520]  Yeah, that's it.
[2:18:19.520 --> 2:18:20.520]  Thank you.
[2:18:20.520 --> 2:18:21.520]  We'll pull it up.
[2:18:21.520 --> 2:18:22.520]  Yes, I am aware of that.
[2:18:22.520 --> 2:18:26.160]  It's like they're announcing, they want you to wear shock bracelets, everybody that gets
[2:18:26.160 --> 2:18:31.400]  on the airplane, Homeland Security did consider that, or they're announcing that the city police
[2:18:31.400 --> 2:18:34.080]  everywhere want neighbors to spy on neighbors.
[2:18:34.080 --> 2:18:38.640]  And there's another article where they're admitting they want to put passive MRIs scanning
[2:18:38.640 --> 2:18:41.880]  us on the highways, Mike Rivera closing comments on that.
[2:18:41.880 --> 2:18:46.580]  Yeah, we're getting into this total scan surveillance now because of that botched assassination
[2:18:46.580 --> 2:18:50.920]  attempt in Saudi Arabia, they're talking about literally scanning the insides of our bodies
[2:18:50.920 --> 2:18:53.440]  before we're allowed on airplanes.
[2:18:53.440 --> 2:18:57.560]  You know, we're getting an X-rays, X-raying the people get a chest X-ray.
[2:18:57.560 --> 2:18:58.560]  Here we go.
[2:18:58.560 --> 2:19:04.240]  Yeah, and it's it's reached a ridiculous degree because, you know, the from bracelets,
[2:19:04.240 --> 2:19:08.080]  the next step will be the implantable chip and the idea is to get us all tagged with
[2:19:08.080 --> 2:19:13.200]  a number so that we can be tracked and taxed and there is no escape from the system.
[2:19:13.200 --> 2:19:17.520]  And that's really what it's all about is making sure that nobody can decide to go off the
[2:19:17.520 --> 2:19:21.320]  grid and not be part of the farm animals.
[2:19:21.320 --> 2:19:22.320]  Absolutely.
[2:19:22.320 --> 2:19:28.320]  Homeland security plans to scan air travelers, air travelers bodily functions.
[2:19:28.320 --> 2:19:33.320]  And here's another one, new technology assist with evacuating with evacuee tracking.
[2:19:33.320 --> 2:19:36.440]  And there they are getting the little bracelets that they also have been reporting they're
[2:19:36.440 --> 2:19:38.440]  going to make us take at the checkpoints.
[2:19:38.440 --> 2:19:41.960]  If you don't have that bracelet, you'll be taken off to a FEMA camp according to police
[2:19:41.960 --> 2:19:45.640]  and military that are speaking out and Homeland Security says, yes, we are studying that
[2:19:45.640 --> 2:19:47.240]  right now.
[2:19:47.240 --> 2:19:48.440]  Thank you so much, Mike Rivera.
[2:19:48.440 --> 2:19:52.160]  We'll see you next month at whatreallyhappen.com of course always will be able to check you
[2:19:52.160 --> 2:19:53.160]  out there.

[2:20:58.320 --> 2:21:01.360]  Be a part of the revolution today.
[2:21:01.360 --> 2:21:07.520]  It is a big idea, a new world order in the near future.
[2:21:07.520 --> 2:21:10.000]  Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[2:21:10.000 --> 2:21:16.160]  It's known as the Bilderberg, but their objective being world domination.
[2:21:16.160 --> 2:21:19.280]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[2:21:19.280 --> 2:21:25.200]  Now as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80%
[2:21:25.200 --> 2:21:29.680]  of humanity is at hand.
[2:21:29.680 --> 2:21:34.680]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[2:21:34.680 --> 2:21:38.960]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[2:21:38.960 --> 2:21:41.640]  Bilderberg is making great progress for the world government.
[2:21:41.640 --> 2:21:42.640]  Most people have no idea.
[2:21:42.640 --> 2:21:43.640]  They're not after money.
[2:21:43.640 --> 2:21:44.640]  They have all the money they need.
[2:21:44.640 --> 2:21:45.640]  They're after power.
[2:21:45.640 --> 2:21:46.640]  That's their affidavit.

[2:21:54.400 --> 2:21:55.400]  In-game, blueprint for global enslavement.
[2:21:55.400 --> 2:21:56.400]  You have been warned.
[2:21:56.400 --> 2:22:04.480]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years hoping to build up enough wealth
[2:22:04.480 --> 2:22:06.960]  to retire and live out their golden years.
[2:22:06.960 --> 2:22:12.040]  Unfortunately with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing and medical, many
[2:22:12.040 --> 2:22:15.080]  retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[2:22:15.080 --> 2:22:19.400]  Is this a flaw for enterprise or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing
[2:22:19.400 --> 2:22:23.320]  us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[2:22:23.320 --> 2:22:27.080]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature
[2:22:27.080 --> 2:22:28.240]  from Jekyll Island.
[2:22:28.240 --> 2:22:32.480]  Congressman Ron Paul states it's what every American needs to know about central bank
[2:22:32.480 --> 2:22:33.480]  power.
[2:22:33.480 --> 2:22:37.360]  It's a gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[2:22:37.360 --> 2:22:38.840]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[2:22:38.840 --> 2:22:43.600]  I will give a silver dollar from the early 1900s to anyone who purchases this book.
[2:22:43.600 --> 2:22:48.440]  Call 1-800-686-2237 and order a copy today.
[2:22:48.440 --> 2:22:51.520]  It's critical that the public be made aware of the system.
[2:22:51.520 --> 2:22:56.320]  Call and order your copy today at 1-800-686-2237.
[2:22:56.320 --> 2:23:00.000]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[2:23:00.000 --> 2:23:02.120]  This is an emergency alert.
[2:23:02.120 --> 2:23:07.720]  More than half the world's doctors and nurses are refusing risky vaccinations this fall.
[2:23:07.720 --> 2:23:12.680]  I'm Dr. Leonard Horowitz, a Harvard-trained public health expert, urging you to avoid
[2:23:12.680 --> 2:23:16.840]  risky vaccinations, especially this flu season.
[2:23:16.840 --> 2:23:20.280]  Rely on oxy-silver instead.
[2:23:20.280 --> 2:23:26.120]  Oxysilver's broad-spectrum action makes all vaccinations and antibiotics unnecessary.
[2:23:26.120 --> 2:23:31.200]  Oxysilver is the most advanced silver hydrosol, far safer than colloidal silvers.
[2:23:31.200 --> 2:23:36.120]  It works so well saving lives and money, protecting and healing you and your family.
[2:23:36.120 --> 2:23:39.880]  It has been targeted for elimination by the drug cartel.
[2:23:39.880 --> 2:23:42.200]  So get it while you still can.
[2:23:42.200 --> 2:23:46.000]  Order oxysilver online at oxysilver.com.

[2:23:52.800 --> 2:23:55.480]  That's 1-888-K-O-Germs.
[2:23:55.480 --> 2:24:15.680]  For Oxysilver Today, this call could save your life.
[2:24:15.680 --> 2:24:21.440]  William Lewis, maker of Camp FEMA, joins us along with the producer Gary Franchi.
[2:24:21.440 --> 2:24:26.800]  When they approached me about being in the film, I was very excited and I consulted on
[2:24:26.800 --> 2:24:27.800]  it.
[2:24:27.800 --> 2:24:34.120]  I worked with them on making sure the information was accurate and they've done a great job.
[2:24:34.120 --> 2:24:38.880]  It shows how we've turned into a prison economy, how our entire economy is converting over
[2:24:38.880 --> 2:24:41.820]  to surveillance, prisons, police state.
[2:24:41.820 --> 2:24:43.960]  We have more prisons than any other country in the world.
[2:24:43.960 --> 2:24:47.800]  The federal government designates sports stadiums and other facilities as mass holding
[2:24:47.800 --> 2:24:50.200]  centers, mass inoculation centers.
[2:24:50.200 --> 2:24:51.320]  They go over all of that.
[2:24:51.320 --> 2:24:53.200]  They show the gun confiscations in New Orleans.
[2:24:53.200 --> 2:24:58.680]  They show the Rex 84, the admitted camp plans, the government documents.
[2:24:58.680 --> 2:25:01.040]  They actually go out to some of the camps.
[2:25:01.040 --> 2:25:10.960]  And I just got back from spending three days in Hardin, Montana, just to show how corrupt
[2:25:10.960 --> 2:25:16.680]  society is, where a known convicted felon con artist could just come into town.
[2:25:16.680 --> 2:25:23.200]  The tiny town of three and a half thousand built a 464 bed prison.
[2:25:23.200 --> 2:25:25.400]  They wanted to put Abu Ghraib people in there.
[2:25:25.400 --> 2:25:27.920]  They wanted to put Camp X-ray people in there.
[2:25:27.920 --> 2:25:31.640]  Now they just want to put the citizens and they call it an economic development plan.
[2:25:31.640 --> 2:25:32.640]  Prisons.
[2:25:32.640 --> 2:25:35.800]  That's what we have is putting you in jail.
[2:25:35.800 --> 2:25:37.200]  And so this is all around us.
[2:25:37.200 --> 2:25:41.120]  And then you dovetail with all the surveillance and the big brother and the Homeland Security
[2:25:41.120 --> 2:25:45.480]  Plans to scan air travelers, bodily functions.
[2:25:45.480 --> 2:25:46.840]  All of this is unfolding.
[2:25:46.840 --> 2:25:51.440]  So I wanted to get the makers of Camp FEMA on today and I wanted to remind listeners,
[2:25:51.440 --> 2:25:58.600]  we have it available at info wars dot com right now again info wars dot com.
[2:25:58.600 --> 2:26:07.460]  It is available for everybody out there.
[2:26:07.460 --> 2:26:11.960]  We hope that people will go and order it and show it to their friends and family because
[2:26:11.960 --> 2:26:13.840]  this film needs to be seen.
[2:26:13.840 --> 2:26:15.520]  Camp FEMA available right now.
[2:26:15.520 --> 2:26:17.920]  Let's go to Gary Franchi and William Lewis.
[2:26:17.920 --> 2:26:19.560]  Guys good to have you on the show with us.
[2:26:19.560 --> 2:26:23.560]  Glad to be here.
[2:26:23.560 --> 2:26:25.080]  Let's go to Franchi first.
[2:26:25.080 --> 2:26:31.200]  Franchi, this is your first, I guess, big direct, not directorial but producer debut.
[2:26:31.200 --> 2:26:34.840]  And I'm glad that the film is a success because it needs to be seen.
[2:26:34.840 --> 2:26:35.840]  Absolutely.
[2:26:35.840 --> 2:26:41.840]  And you mentioned it yourself just now about home screenings and we want people to invite
[2:26:41.840 --> 2:26:48.400]  their friends and family over to their house, sit down and analyze the film, take the facts
[2:26:48.400 --> 2:26:55.880]  in and spread this message to their loved ones because what's happening in America needs
[2:26:55.880 --> 2:27:02.840]  to stop the demonizing of constitutional Americans and the MIAC report, Homeland Security documents,
[2:27:02.840 --> 2:27:07.280]  the growth of this prison industrial complex that you just went off to heart in.
[2:27:07.280 --> 2:27:11.880]  These are all facts that are covered in the film that obviously the mainstream media doesn't
[2:27:11.880 --> 2:27:12.880]  want to cover.
[2:27:12.880 --> 2:27:16.640]  Glenn Beck is just way-washing the whole thing with popular mechanics.
[2:27:16.640 --> 2:27:23.200]  And these facts need to be exposed and that's why we put the film together just to do that.
[2:27:23.200 --> 2:27:26.600]  Well, I'm glad you did it.
[2:27:26.600 --> 2:27:28.000]  Let's go to William Lewis.
[2:27:28.000 --> 2:27:31.200]  William, in a nutshell, break down what Camp FEMA covers.
[2:27:31.200 --> 2:27:32.200]  Okay.
[2:27:32.200 --> 2:27:38.120]  Camp FEMA, we start back in the 1940s, show people how these internment camps are really
[2:27:38.120 --> 2:27:39.120]  nothing new.
[2:27:39.120 --> 2:27:40.360]  This just happened before.
[2:27:40.360 --> 2:27:47.120]  We show the similarities between those camps that were built back in the 1940s and the HR645
[2:27:47.120 --> 2:27:53.200]  legislation that we see introduced recently by Alfie Hastings of Florida.
[2:27:53.200 --> 2:27:56.120]  And we compare what did they do back then?
[2:27:56.120 --> 2:27:57.120]  What do they want in this film?
[2:27:57.120 --> 2:27:58.120]  How similar are they?
[2:27:58.120 --> 2:27:59.560]  And, you know, come to find out.
[2:27:59.560 --> 2:28:00.560]  They're very similar.
[2:28:00.560 --> 2:28:09.000]  We go through all of the legislation, the documentation, FDI, Senate, COINTELPRO, everything.
[2:28:09.000 --> 2:28:11.760]  Trying to explain to people that this is really nothing new.
[2:28:11.760 --> 2:28:14.160]  This is a pattern we've established.
[2:28:14.160 --> 2:28:18.440]  And, you know, we even see some of the same wording and the same phrases come up telling
[2:28:18.440 --> 2:28:21.560]  us what they want to do to us, how they want to do it.
[2:28:21.560 --> 2:28:27.280]  And now they've got internment camps being, you know, just built right out in the open,
[2:28:27.280 --> 2:28:32.680]  after being hired to do it, and they're, you know, the National Guard is actually actively
[2:28:32.680 --> 2:28:37.000]  hiring for these positions of internment and resettlement specialists.
[2:28:37.000 --> 2:28:43.440]  So you put all this together, put some photos with it, and we kind of show, show people
[2:28:43.440 --> 2:28:50.920]  that FEMA camps are no longer this internet-based conspiracy theory that is very much based
[2:28:50.920 --> 2:28:55.920]  in reality and based in black and white, as we show in the documentary.
[2:28:55.920 --> 2:28:57.520]  And the denial is over with this film.
[2:28:57.520 --> 2:29:00.720]  I mean, the rumors and the documentation is total.
[2:29:00.720 --> 2:29:04.040]  We need to have a national debate about how they're setting up fusion centers, putting
[2:29:04.040 --> 2:29:10.160]  Brigade Homeland on the streets, taking over our society, can't FEMA does that.
[2:29:10.160 --> 2:29:11.560]  And so the denial can end.
[2:29:11.560 --> 2:29:13.440]  This country is turning into a giant prison grid.
[2:29:13.440 --> 2:29:18.280]  The military industrial complex is just coming back to America and taking us over and ruling
[2:29:18.280 --> 2:29:20.480]  us and making their police state profitable.
[2:29:20.480 --> 2:29:26.080]  You have all these private interests that make the profits off what they've set up.
[2:29:26.080 --> 2:29:29.080]  Well, I mean, that's what's happening.
[2:29:29.080 --> 2:29:32.480]  Look at the person who made Labor Program.
[2:29:32.480 --> 2:29:33.480]  Absolutely.
[2:29:33.480 --> 2:29:34.480]  All right, man.
[2:29:34.480 --> 2:29:35.480]  Stay there.
[2:29:35.480 --> 2:29:36.480]  I want to come back.
[2:29:36.480 --> 2:29:39.760]  I want people to be able to call in, too, and ask you guys questions about Camp FEMA,
[2:29:39.760 --> 2:29:42.480]  what you've learned about the New World Order's, Gulag, or Grappelago.
[2:29:42.480 --> 2:29:49.120]  We'll tie it into Hardin, Montana, with big developments there on the other side, 1-800-259-9231.
[2:29:49.120 --> 2:29:51.760]  More financial news and flu news coming up, too.
[2:29:51.760 --> 2:29:53.080]  We're on the march.
[2:29:53.080 --> 2:29:55.560]  The Empire's on the run.
[2:29:55.560 --> 2:30:00.960]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[2:30:00.960 --> 2:30:01.960]  Hello, friends.
[2:30:01.960 --> 2:30:04.880]  This is Alex Jones, and I want each of you to ask yourself this question.
[2:30:04.880 --> 2:30:07.160]  Do you really know what's in your tap water?
[2:30:07.160 --> 2:30:12.800]  In a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor, they found that over 260 chemicals
[2:30:12.800 --> 2:30:15.800]  in pollutants are present in municipal drinking water.
[2:30:15.800 --> 2:30:19.960]  Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive, immune, and developmental
[2:30:19.960 --> 2:30:20.960]  system diseases.
[2:30:20.960 --> 2:30:23.120]  Now, what are you going to do about it?
[2:30:23.120 --> 2:30:27.880]  The Acola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator is a low-cost way to take back control of
[2:30:27.880 --> 2:30:29.640]  you and your family's drinking water.
[2:30:29.640 --> 2:30:34.360]  The Acola Blue 28 produces up to seven gallons of water from the humidity in the atmosphere
[2:30:34.360 --> 2:30:39.920]  and uses state-of-the-art carbon filtration, reverse osmosis, and ultra-violent light sterilization
[2:30:39.920 --> 2:30:40.920]  techniques.
[2:30:40.920 --> 2:30:41.920]  That's right.
[2:30:41.920 --> 2:30:42.920]  Clean water.
[2:30:42.920 --> 2:30:43.920]  Right from the air you breathe.
[2:30:43.920 --> 2:30:48.760]  That's the order today by calling 1-800-691-6043.
[2:30:48.760 --> 2:30:58.800]  That's 1-800-691-6043, or visit Acola Blue on the web at www.ecoloblu.com today.
[2:30:58.800 --> 2:31:00.960]  That's AcolaBlue.com.
[2:31:00.960 --> 2:31:05.640]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want
[2:31:05.640 --> 2:31:06.640]  you to eat.
[2:31:06.640 --> 2:31:10.120]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you
[2:31:10.120 --> 2:31:11.120]  sick?
[2:31:11.120 --> 2:31:13.080]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[2:31:13.080 --> 2:31:14.760]  You don't have to cooperate.
[2:31:14.760 --> 2:31:16.000]  There is a solution.
[2:31:16.000 --> 2:31:19.640]  Inner Health Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing

[2:32:00.400 --> 2:32:04.760]  Years, doctors and researchers have known that one of the major pathways to better
[2:32:04.760 --> 2:32:09.120]  health is an alkaline diet rich in minerals and antioxidants to keep the body and proper

[2:34:34.840 --> 2:34:39.880]  And again, you can go up to followtherepublic.com and watch the latest trailer that really gives
[2:34:39.880 --> 2:34:42.840]  you an idea of what's covered in the film.
[2:34:42.840 --> 2:34:46.160]  You can also go to prisonplanet.tv and watch the latest trailer.
[2:34:46.160 --> 2:34:52.600]  It will premiere there October 21st at prisonplanet.tv for all the wonderful members there that
[2:34:52.600 --> 2:34:57.640]  are also watching us live as we simulcast right now.
[2:34:57.640 --> 2:35:01.960]  But I just want to ask everybody to make this the biggest film we've ever released, to make
[2:35:01.960 --> 2:35:06.200]  it the most viral, to spread it on the Internet, to make copies of it, to give it to your friends,
[2:35:06.200 --> 2:35:07.800]  your families, and neighbors.
[2:35:07.800 --> 2:35:09.080]  They cannot stop the signal.
[2:35:09.080 --> 2:35:13.760]  This exposes who the bankers are, what they're doing, what they're setting up, and how we
[2:35:13.760 --> 2:35:14.760]  can stop them.
[2:35:14.760 --> 2:35:17.120]  It's Fall of the Republic, Volume 1.
[2:35:17.120 --> 2:35:24.920]  Here it is, ladies and gentlemen.
[2:35:24.920 --> 2:35:29.440]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[2:35:29.440 --> 2:35:32.720]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[2:35:32.720 --> 2:35:37.720]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans
[2:35:37.720 --> 2:35:38.720]  at home.
[2:35:38.720 --> 2:35:43.880]  They have tremendous influence on our president in Congress, and they really are calling the
[2:35:43.880 --> 2:35:46.240]  shots.
[2:35:46.240 --> 2:35:51.320]  Now is the time for all good men and women to come to the aid of their country.
[2:35:51.320 --> 2:35:58.320]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[2:35:58.320 --> 2:36:11.640]  One of the greatest events in history is taking place before our very eyes.
[2:36:11.640 --> 2:36:16.160]  It's up to every man, woman, and child in the United States to decide whether we're
[2:36:16.160 --> 2:36:20.800]  going to be fooled by the slick propaganda of the social engineers, or whether we're
[2:36:20.800 --> 2:36:23.840]  going to restore the Republic.
[2:36:23.840 --> 2:36:29.040]  We have seen this erosion to the point where today seems like nobody does care, and right
[2:36:29.040 --> 2:36:38.640]  now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[2:36:38.640 --> 2:36:40.640]  Who's going to soak up the derivatives?
[2:36:40.640 --> 2:36:42.200]  Who's going to soak up the debt?
[2:36:42.200 --> 2:36:44.000]  Who's going to be penalized?
[2:36:44.000 --> 2:36:49.480]  Enron's CEO, Ken Lay, was involved in discussions with you at the White House about helping
[2:36:49.480 --> 2:36:53.120]  develop this type of policy, this trading scheme.
[2:36:53.120 --> 2:36:54.120]  I don't know.
[2:36:54.120 --> 2:36:58.760]  Do you think it's consistent with the spirit of that provision of constitution to hand
[2:36:58.760 --> 2:37:01.120]  out half a trillion dollars to foreigners?
[2:37:01.120 --> 2:37:04.680]  Will we choose liberty, or will we choose tyranny?
[2:37:04.680 --> 2:37:07.240]  The Republic is hanging by a thread.
[2:37:07.240 --> 2:37:10.160]  You don't have a president, you have an actor.
[2:37:10.160 --> 2:37:15.160]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, and arsonists, they're asking for more matches, and the Congress
[2:37:15.160 --> 2:37:17.160]  is saying, who do we make the checkout to?
[2:37:17.160 --> 2:37:19.000]  Who do we send these matches to?
[2:37:19.000 --> 2:37:24.920]  The last vestiges of our free system of government are being swept away.
[2:37:24.920 --> 2:37:27.800]  Fall of the Republic.
[2:37:27.800 --> 2:37:32.000]  Volume 1, Presidency of Barack Obama.
[2:37:32.000 --> 2:37:38.880]  Available on DVD at infowars.com and online at prismpana.tv.
[2:37:38.880 --> 2:37:42.800]  The destiny of humanity is in our hands.
[2:37:42.800 --> 2:37:44.800]  October 21st, 2009.
[2:37:44.800 --> 2:37:48.760]  All right, that is the new trailer.
[2:37:48.760 --> 2:37:51.960]  It's going up on the Alex Jones channel at YouTube in the next few minutes.
[2:37:51.960 --> 2:37:57.040]  Please help spread it virally, just like you've done with Camp FEMA.
[2:37:57.040 --> 2:38:01.840]  But this Fall of the Republic film gets into everything, the mind control, the bankers,
[2:38:01.840 --> 2:38:06.600]  who they are, their master plan, how to stop them, what they're doing.
[2:38:06.600 --> 2:38:11.000]  The establishment can only succeed if the people are not aware of what's going on.
[2:38:11.000 --> 2:38:15.800]  You are the ones that will make Fall of the Republic effective, just like you did with
[2:38:15.800 --> 2:38:17.920]  the Obama deception they're continuing to do.
[2:38:17.920 --> 2:38:22.680]  Going back to Gary Franchi and William Lewis, you guys aren't watching us, I guess, on
[2:38:22.680 --> 2:38:25.600]  prismplanet.tv, but hearing that, does that sound pretty exciting?
[2:38:25.600 --> 2:38:28.600]  Oh, I can't wait to hear it.
[2:38:28.600 --> 2:38:29.600]  I'm excited.
[2:38:29.600 --> 2:38:32.520]  We're going to get free coffee, right?
[2:38:32.520 --> 2:38:33.520]  Absolutely, Lewis.
[2:38:33.520 --> 2:38:37.720]  All right, enough of me talking about that.
[2:38:37.720 --> 2:38:39.200]  I just hope people will pre-order.
[2:38:39.200 --> 2:38:40.960]  Everyone have a big push right up front.
[2:38:40.960 --> 2:38:45.120]  Everybody getting copies, making copies, spreading it, getting it out to everybody.
[2:38:45.120 --> 2:38:47.720]  We've got all sorts of harassment going on over this film.
[2:38:47.720 --> 2:38:48.720]  Later it'll come out.
[2:38:48.720 --> 2:38:49.720]  We're getting harassment out of Chicago.
[2:38:49.720 --> 2:38:54.640]  A bunch of others, I'm on the White House enemies list, and boy, they're letting me know
[2:38:54.640 --> 2:38:55.640]  now.
[2:38:55.640 --> 2:38:59.040]  They are really letting me know out of Chicago, so I'm going to have to counter some people.
[2:38:59.040 --> 2:39:00.840]  I can talk about that in the future.
[2:39:00.840 --> 2:39:04.240]  It's just, you know, I kind of enjoy being attacked now behind the scenes because it
[2:39:04.240 --> 2:39:06.160]  means I'm really getting their attention.
[2:39:06.160 --> 2:39:07.160]  What about you guys?
[2:39:07.160 --> 2:39:11.680]  Are there any death threats over Camp Fama, or how's that going?
[2:39:11.680 --> 2:39:14.080]  Well, no death threat yet.
[2:39:14.080 --> 2:39:18.880]  Actually, the reception for Camp Fima's been quite well.
[2:39:18.880 --> 2:39:24.760]  You know, we get tons of emails, just on a daily basis, that I never had the time to
[2:39:24.760 --> 2:39:29.800]  return every single one of them, but we try.
[2:39:29.800 --> 2:39:34.000]  Maybe we should go through a list, you know, we've got several things coming up, the Midwest
[2:39:34.000 --> 2:39:39.360]  Liberty Fest is coming up this weekend, where people can go out and watch Camp Fima there.
[2:39:39.360 --> 2:39:46.120]  There's a Canadian theatrical premiere coming up in Toronto on October the 17th, and that's
[2:39:46.120 --> 2:39:47.880]  going to be pretty big from what I understand.
[2:39:47.880 --> 2:39:53.360]  I won't be able to attend neither will Gary, but you should if you're in the Toronto area,
[2:39:53.360 --> 2:39:55.760]  at least show up and see what's going on.
[2:39:55.760 --> 2:40:00.800]  Then we've got, you know, right after that, the next day, there's another screening in
[2:40:00.800 --> 2:40:01.800]  Ohio.
[2:40:01.800 --> 2:40:03.120]  I mean, the list just goes on and on.
[2:40:03.120 --> 2:40:04.120]  That's exciting.
[2:40:04.120 --> 2:40:05.920]  People are out there spreading and getting involved.
[2:40:05.920 --> 2:40:06.920]  That's important.
[2:40:06.920 --> 2:40:09.320]  More about the film, though, for people that haven't seen it.
[2:40:09.320 --> 2:40:13.200]  I mean, I mean, he could, I mean, I, of course, I'm in the film, other great people are,
[2:40:13.200 --> 2:40:18.680]  but the point is, it really lays out just the facts and exposes what's going on.
[2:40:18.680 --> 2:40:24.000]  We can't talk about Fima camps without talking about the mindset of our leaders in Washington
[2:40:24.000 --> 2:40:30.880]  and how this has been done in history's past, how have, how have past, uh, dictatorial,
[2:40:30.880 --> 2:40:35.720]  you know, regimes come into power, how did they get the people in Germany to go along
[2:40:35.720 --> 2:40:37.560]  with rounding up the Jews?
[2:40:37.560 --> 2:40:40.360]  You know, those are the types of things that we're looking at.
[2:40:40.360 --> 2:40:44.840]  We've gone out to people like Chuck Baldwin, who was specifically named in the Mayak report
[2:40:44.840 --> 2:40:47.960]  to tell us how they've done this in the past.
[2:40:47.960 --> 2:40:52.440]  And, um, you know, we know that they want to demonize and marginalize everything that
[2:40:52.440 --> 2:40:58.600]  anyone says who might be opposed to gun control or opposed to income tax, abortion, illegal
[2:40:58.600 --> 2:41:03.440]  immigration, whatever your single issue is, the private fellow reserve, they demonize
[2:41:03.440 --> 2:41:04.440]  those groups.
[2:41:04.440 --> 2:41:05.440]  United nation.
[2:41:05.440 --> 2:41:09.960]  People who use the term the new world order, that's why we have some, uh, some representation
[2:41:09.960 --> 2:41:13.560]  in here from the constitution party because you know, that's even in, I believe, a part
[2:41:13.560 --> 2:41:14.560]  of their platform.
[2:41:14.560 --> 2:41:18.360]  And I was, I was just researching last night on, uh, some of these third parties that are
[2:41:18.360 --> 2:41:19.360]  out there.
[2:41:19.360 --> 2:41:23.680]  And you know, even on Wikipedia, they put new world order in these quotes, like it doesn't
[2:41:23.680 --> 2:41:24.680]  really exist.
[2:41:24.680 --> 2:41:29.680]  Though I have more than 10 mainstream news articles saying the demise of the dollar rise
[2:41:29.680 --> 2:41:35.160]  of the new world order, you know, that's what we say, fall the republic, birth of the new
[2:41:35.160 --> 2:41:36.960]  world order, rise of the resistance.
[2:41:36.960 --> 2:41:42.400]  I mean, they're announcing world government owned and run by private banks.
[2:41:42.400 --> 2:41:46.640]  What we always said it would be, we were reading their own documents and they still say it
[2:41:46.640 --> 2:41:48.000]  doesn't exist.
[2:41:48.000 --> 2:41:50.920]  That's a military psych warfare term.
[2:41:50.920 --> 2:41:51.920]  That's done.
[2:41:51.920 --> 2:41:55.040]  And that, that, that, that out of hand, Gary Francis, speak to that because I know you've
[2:41:55.040 --> 2:42:00.880]  studied it, how they'll deny something, even as it's happening to make it about the debate
[2:42:00.880 --> 2:42:02.600]  of whether it exists or not.
[2:42:02.600 --> 2:42:07.680]  It's like I'm still debating with hardened Montana should, you know, is this guy a felon
[2:42:07.680 --> 2:42:13.240]  when it's admitted he's a felon con artist and I'm telling them for a week, it's a fake
[2:42:13.240 --> 2:42:14.240]  contract.
[2:42:14.240 --> 2:42:15.240]  I'm going to go ahead.
[2:42:15.240 --> 2:42:19.640]  I'm just saying it's classic or William doubles beat, you know, they, they say it is when
[2:42:19.640 --> 2:42:25.120]  it isn't and when it is, it's not, you know, it's, it's just playing my game with the American
[2:42:25.120 --> 2:42:26.120]  people.
[2:42:26.120 --> 2:42:27.960]  I'm like, you just, you just quoted all these headlines.
[2:42:27.960 --> 2:42:32.680]  I've seen the headlines out there in the mainstream news saying that the new world order is rising
[2:42:32.680 --> 2:42:36.840]  up, you know, and that meanwhile they demonize us because we're going to go ahead and fight
[2:42:36.840 --> 2:42:39.160]  it and they marginalized us.
[2:42:39.160 --> 2:42:44.080]  But the problem is they're only, they're giving us more fuel, more energy to fight.
[2:42:44.080 --> 2:42:45.160]  And that's what this film does.
[2:42:45.160 --> 2:42:46.160]  That's what you do.
[2:42:46.160 --> 2:42:50.280]  We put the message out so we can fight the new world order, take it down and restore
[2:42:50.280 --> 2:42:54.680]  our republic.
[2:42:54.680 --> 2:42:55.680]  Absolutely.
[2:42:55.680 --> 2:43:05.000]  Um, continuing just with the news we're witnessing before I get into some other facets of the
[2:43:05.000 --> 2:43:10.280]  police state, what did you guys think about the hardened situation with the mercenaries
[2:43:10.280 --> 2:43:15.000]  and taking over the, the, uh, prison facility that they wanted to hold prisoners in?
[2:43:15.000 --> 2:43:19.400]  I told local media that when I was inside, we even have footage of this and Becky Shea
[2:43:19.400 --> 2:43:21.280]  saying, don't tape that.
[2:43:21.280 --> 2:43:29.000]  They had on the wall enemy combatant area, enemy combatant holding, um, alien holding
[2:43:29.000 --> 2:43:35.480]  area, uh, uh, alien detainee holding areas, the exact quote.
[2:43:35.480 --> 2:43:44.240]  The local newspaper spun that and said Jones was on air saying packets of mustard in Becky
[2:43:44.240 --> 2:43:47.840]  Shea's desk were mustard gas.
[2:43:47.840 --> 2:43:53.640]  I never said anything about mustard and that space aliens were being kept there.
[2:43:53.640 --> 2:43:56.080]  Now that's how they spend this.
[2:43:56.080 --> 2:43:58.680]  Becky Shea made a joke in front of the, on the radio.
[2:43:58.680 --> 2:44:01.440]  She said, oh, there's, you know, there's nothing back there.
[2:44:01.440 --> 2:44:04.400]  I don't want you back in that area of the prison because there's nothing but a bunch
[2:44:04.400 --> 2:44:06.760]  of mustard packages in the desk.
[2:44:06.760 --> 2:44:11.240]  So her saying a joke about mustard packages on video, we have this on video, turns into
[2:44:11.240 --> 2:44:17.640]  I say there's mustard gas, which I'd ever said, and I'm saying space aliens area 51
[2:44:17.640 --> 2:44:18.640]  are there.
[2:44:18.640 --> 2:44:25.000]  No, they had big old maps of blueprints saying alien detention area.
[2:44:25.000 --> 2:44:27.680]  Well, here's my take on it, Alex.
[2:44:27.680 --> 2:44:32.440]  And, and what, for my research and for my talk with National Guardsmen, uh, you know,
[2:44:32.440 --> 2:44:40.120]  I've learned that there is a huge swath of good Americans who are serving this country
[2:44:40.120 --> 2:44:44.440]  and they have said that they will refuse the orders when it comes down to take the guns
[2:44:44.440 --> 2:44:46.920]  and the to round up people.
[2:44:46.920 --> 2:44:54.400]  But the, the powers that be the new old order needs the private mercenary army to fill the
[2:44:54.400 --> 2:45:01.480]  gap when the American military decides, you know, the grunts, the hardworking guys decide
[2:45:01.480 --> 2:45:03.640]  they're not going to follow these orders.
[2:45:03.640 --> 2:45:06.560]  I mean, they're, they're out there saying it.
[2:45:06.560 --> 2:45:11.920]  So these mercenary forces like Blackwater, like American police force, are there to
[2:45:11.920 --> 2:45:14.280]  fill the void?
[2:45:14.280 --> 2:45:17.680]  Well, they certainly are.
[2:45:17.680 --> 2:45:22.080]  But, but, you know, I know Ron Paul got more contributions than anybody else from the military.
[2:45:22.080 --> 2:45:26.600]  And I know I run into a lot of even TSA people when I'm flying their fans want my signature,
[2:45:26.600 --> 2:45:27.600]  the majority of them.
[2:45:27.600 --> 2:45:28.600]  It's freaking me out.
[2:45:28.600 --> 2:45:32.720]  But then I go to a place like buildings, Montana, they were the worst Nazis I've ever
[2:45:32.720 --> 2:45:36.280]  seen harassing old ladies, us free, really embarrassing.
[2:45:36.280 --> 2:45:40.160]  I was embarrassed for them sickening a power trip.
[2:45:40.160 --> 2:45:43.760]  But you look at yesterday, 400 people show up the park.
[2:45:43.760 --> 2:45:44.760]  They're peaceful.
[2:45:44.760 --> 2:45:46.200]  They're told you're not allowed to protest.
[2:45:46.200 --> 2:45:51.200]  They arrest them G 20 old women coming out of stores with bags going.
[2:45:51.200 --> 2:45:52.200]  What's going on?
[2:45:52.200 --> 2:45:56.760]  Officer shut up bitch hitting her with clubs, police dogs attacking her and then the cops
[2:45:56.760 --> 2:46:01.000]  defend it, driving down neighborhoods, hitting nine year old kids in their front yard playing
[2:46:01.000 --> 2:46:02.000]  football.
[2:46:02.000 --> 2:46:03.720]  I mean, the cops were out of control.
[2:46:03.720 --> 2:46:07.240]  My guys got footage hiding in stores of them just driving around attacking anybody on the
[2:46:07.240 --> 2:46:08.240]  street.
[2:46:08.240 --> 2:46:12.120]  Then they go over and attack the university two nights in a row.
[2:46:12.120 --> 2:46:13.680]  My guys weren't there on the 24th.
[2:46:13.680 --> 2:46:16.480]  So I said, go over there on the 25th.
[2:46:16.480 --> 2:46:21.160]  They surrounded the park, wouldn't let the media out, arrested Rob do beat up Luke Radowski
[2:46:21.160 --> 2:46:25.360]  and then charged do with stuff the night before, even though he wasn't even there.
[2:46:25.360 --> 2:46:29.160]  He's charged with the 24th and they, and we've called the prosecutor and you're like, that's
[2:46:29.160 --> 2:46:30.160]  where it is.
[2:46:30.160 --> 2:46:31.160]  We don't care if it's a wrong day.
[2:46:31.160 --> 2:46:32.160]  Go to hell.
[2:46:32.160 --> 2:46:37.080]  I mean, it's just a criminal government and the National Guard was ready to fire sound
[2:46:37.080 --> 2:46:38.320]  cannons at people.
[2:46:38.320 --> 2:46:41.600]  The police enjoyed running up to women.
[2:46:41.600 --> 2:46:45.840]  I mean, little, you know, college girls and got hit them with clubs.
[2:46:45.840 --> 2:46:50.520]  I mean, and then hitting them again when they try to get up.
[2:46:50.520 --> 2:46:51.600]  So I don't know.
[2:46:51.600 --> 2:46:54.720]  I mean, I know there's a lot of police and military say they're awake, but I think under
[2:46:54.720 --> 2:46:57.600]  peer pressure if they told them take a two year old baby and shoot it in the back of
[2:46:57.600 --> 2:46:58.600]  the head.
[2:46:58.600 --> 2:46:59.600]  I think they do it.
[2:46:59.600 --> 2:47:05.520]  You know, we had our own cameraman out there for our show, the reality reports, Lee, you
[2:47:05.520 --> 2:47:09.640]  know, he was rounded up right alongside Lee and all he was doing or he was rounded up
[2:47:09.640 --> 2:47:13.040]  right alongside Luke and all he was doing was pointing a camera in the direction of
[2:47:13.040 --> 2:47:14.040]  tyranny.
[2:47:14.040 --> 2:47:19.280]  You know, I mean, these police, like you say, when they're when they're lined up, when
[2:47:19.280 --> 2:47:22.080]  they've got all their body armor on, they've got their gas.
[2:47:22.080 --> 2:47:28.000]  Yes, there is a there is a gang mentality that takes over, you know, and they want that
[2:47:28.000 --> 2:47:29.800]  paycheck.
[2:47:29.800 --> 2:47:32.240]  So we know we have to get to the police and military.
[2:47:32.240 --> 2:47:33.720]  We have to reach out.
[2:47:33.720 --> 2:47:39.280]  Um, they are the front lines and we have to wake them up too.
[2:47:39.280 --> 2:47:40.280]  Well, absolutely.
[2:47:40.280 --> 2:47:45.720]  Um, well, let me get into the hardened situation.
[2:47:45.720 --> 2:47:49.840]  We found out last Sunday, I heard about it Friday, didn't check into it.
[2:47:49.840 --> 2:47:56.920]  But last, not this Sunday, the same before, like 10, 11 days ago, we found out that this
[2:47:56.920 --> 2:47:58.240]  guy was a felon.
[2:47:58.240 --> 2:47:59.600]  We found out he had aliases.
[2:47:59.600 --> 2:48:03.280]  We found out he was tied into these other defense contractors.
[2:48:03.280 --> 2:48:08.320]  We found out he didn't have a license to take over the giant detention center, $27 million.
[2:48:08.320 --> 2:48:09.680]  They were policing the town.
[2:48:09.680 --> 2:48:12.760]  They had gone to city council saying we're going to be your new police.
[2:48:12.760 --> 2:48:16.520]  That's now admitted in the news, Billings Gazette.
[2:48:16.520 --> 2:48:20.640]  And I went to harden and the locals were all most of them were fans of the show.
[2:48:20.640 --> 2:48:24.760]  It blew me away, but the constabulary, the local sheriff's people and others, they were
[2:48:24.760 --> 2:48:25.760]  on power trips.
[2:48:25.760 --> 2:48:26.960]  Say, why don't you get out of here?
[2:48:26.960 --> 2:48:29.000]  You don't belong around here, but, but this guy's from Serbia.
[2:48:29.000 --> 2:48:32.480]  Well, we like him and I would say, but he's a convicted felon.
[2:48:32.480 --> 2:48:33.600]  He's a con artist.
[2:48:33.600 --> 2:48:35.800]  He doesn't have the money to lease this facility.
[2:48:35.800 --> 2:48:37.600]  He wants, he's in a police uniform.
[2:48:37.600 --> 2:48:39.520]  He's just going to suck off the town.
[2:48:39.520 --> 2:48:45.180]  He's a, he's a convicted 14 time grand, you know, theft criminal.
[2:48:45.180 --> 2:48:48.560]  He wants to be in a badge and gun, a true criminal regime.
[2:48:48.560 --> 2:48:50.280]  And they said, we don't care if he's a criminal.
[2:48:50.280 --> 2:48:54.160]  Some of the locals told me because they thought they were part of the establishment and they
[2:48:54.160 --> 2:48:56.840]  said, no, he's real.
[2:48:56.840 --> 2:48:59.160]  Now he's the head of American police force.
[2:48:59.160 --> 2:49:00.160]  Then they called up a lawyer.
[2:49:00.160 --> 2:49:03.240]  He was supposedly the head and he said, no, I'm not even part of it.
[2:49:03.240 --> 2:49:09.320]  Now they described the two rivers authority meeting last night in the building's Gazette
[2:49:09.320 --> 2:49:13.980]  as if the one guy was bad who'd said, I don't want to be part of this and this is a fraud.
[2:49:13.980 --> 2:49:17.400]  The other members were still saying, we want to do this deal.
[2:49:17.400 --> 2:49:23.160]  So even when they know it's a con artist, know it's a fraud, know it's a scam, the locals
[2:49:23.160 --> 2:49:27.400]  wanted to literally police the town themselves and literally be predators.
[2:49:27.400 --> 2:49:28.400]  And here it is.
[2:49:28.400 --> 2:49:31.760]  Red flags cause Montana officials to Nick's American police force deal.
[2:49:31.760 --> 2:49:32.760]  There was no deal.
[2:49:32.760 --> 2:49:34.760]  It was a scam.
[2:49:34.760 --> 2:49:38.280]  California judge orders head of hardened jail project to court for, you know, millions
[2:49:38.280 --> 2:49:41.440]  of dollars of fraud.
[2:49:41.440 --> 2:49:45.040]  Two rivers board raises questions about hardened prison contract.
[2:49:45.040 --> 2:49:49.200]  It's all a fraud, APF front man loses credibility and hardened.
[2:49:49.200 --> 2:49:54.160]  The reason I bring this up guys is that if mercenaries can just show up and you'd have
[2:49:54.160 --> 2:49:57.440]  German and other mercenaries with him and think they're just going to, and they were
[2:49:57.440 --> 2:50:00.880]  going to get away with it till we got involved, the listeners especially.
[2:50:00.880 --> 2:50:03.200]  And we are blamed by the locals for stopping it.
[2:50:03.200 --> 2:50:04.200]  They're very angry.
[2:50:04.200 --> 2:50:05.880]  They're not mad that we warned about a con artist.
[2:50:05.880 --> 2:50:07.440]  They wanted to be part of it.
[2:50:07.440 --> 2:50:08.560]  They wanted to do this.
[2:50:08.560 --> 2:50:09.560]  They loved him.
[2:50:09.560 --> 2:50:15.640]  It was, you know, thugs, loving thugs that, that in America, any type of criminal operation
[2:50:15.640 --> 2:50:20.400]  can just take over as long as it's wearing a badge, Gary Franchi, well, you know, they,
[2:50:20.400 --> 2:50:22.960]  they are willing to take the money and run.
[2:50:22.960 --> 2:50:23.960]  That's what it comes down to.
[2:50:23.960 --> 2:50:28.320]  You know, they get these big promises from this guy, this fraud, this Charleston to come
[2:50:28.320 --> 2:50:32.320]  into town, like the snake oil salesman, I'm going to, I'm going to boost your economy.
[2:50:32.320 --> 2:50:35.800]  I'm going to bring all these jobs and I'm going to employ all of your people.
[2:50:35.800 --> 2:50:36.800]  That's all they saw.
[2:50:36.800 --> 2:50:37.800]  That's all they saw.
[2:50:37.800 --> 2:50:38.800]  They didn't look at the repercussions.
[2:50:38.800 --> 2:50:43.360]  They just saw the dollars sign.
[2:50:43.360 --> 2:50:48.520]  I want to get William Lewis's take on this, but there's the big development.
[2:50:48.520 --> 2:50:50.520]  He did meet with a bunch of big defense contractors.
[2:50:50.520 --> 2:50:54.240]  He was talking about contracting with them there, but they aren't involved.
[2:50:54.240 --> 2:50:55.640]  There are no backers.
[2:50:55.640 --> 2:51:01.280]  It's all a complete fraud and the local town boss hogs, they love it.
[2:51:01.280 --> 2:51:02.280]  Hello friends.
[2:51:02.280 --> 2:51:05.160]  This is Alex Jones here to tell you about Cal Bend soap.

[2:52:09.200 --> 2:52:10.200]  is complete.
[2:52:10.200 --> 2:52:13.960]  The shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating
[2:52:13.960 --> 2:52:19.000]  terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[2:52:19.000 --> 2:52:23.640]  Terror storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in
[2:52:23.640 --> 2:52:26.480]  London were carried out by British intelligence.
[2:52:26.480 --> 2:52:30.320]  Terror storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to
[2:52:30.320 --> 2:52:36.840]  disseminate fake news, NSA spy, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information and much
[2:52:36.840 --> 2:52:37.840]  much more.
[2:52:37.840 --> 2:52:41.760]  Terror storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[2:52:41.760 --> 2:52:44.240]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[2:52:44.240 --> 2:52:48.520]  Terror storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[2:53:05.880 --> 2:53:10.200]  The Native Americans discovered an astonishing healing plant called Siaga.
[2:53:10.200 --> 2:53:15.520]  This pesticide-free, wild-crafted, all-natural wonder is hand-picked by a medicine man and

[2:54:51.040 --> 2:55:00.240]  at 1-800-259-9231, William Lois, the director of Camp FEMA, available right now at infowars.com.
[2:55:00.240 --> 2:55:03.440]  We also have it discounted when you get it, when you pre-order it with the film coming
[2:55:03.440 --> 2:55:06.640]  out in just about a week and a half, and that, of course, is for the Republic.
[2:55:06.640 --> 2:55:09.240]  I'm so excited about this documentary.
[2:55:09.240 --> 2:55:13.160]  William, your comments on the mercenaries, your comments on this story, of how when
[2:55:13.160 --> 2:55:17.720]  they even knew he was a fraud and a scam and wanted to police the locals, they just said
[2:55:17.720 --> 2:55:18.720]  big deal.
[2:55:18.720 --> 2:55:19.720]  So what?
[2:55:19.720 --> 2:55:24.320]  It's just, we have this criminal class in control of our local governments and our
[2:55:24.320 --> 2:55:28.720]  federal government, and it's just going to get worse and worse until we realize this.
[2:55:28.720 --> 2:55:33.360]  Government is not a license to steal for all the boss hog scum that runs it.
[2:55:33.360 --> 2:55:40.080]  Well, all those people are more than happy to participate in this policing program and
[2:55:40.080 --> 2:55:48.080]  be under the control of Mr. Culver, but I doubt very many of those people would feel
[2:55:48.080 --> 2:55:51.080]  the same way if they were allowed to carry through with this plan.
[2:55:51.080 --> 2:55:56.960]  I was reading an article by Stevie Kidd, and she's released some information in this article
[2:55:56.960 --> 2:56:05.520]  that she's actually an executive with the security firm International SOS out of Pennsylvania,
[2:56:05.520 --> 2:56:11.680]  and ISOF provides security services and says that it's the world's largest medical and
[2:56:11.680 --> 2:56:12.680]  security assistance company.
[2:56:12.680 --> 2:56:14.520]  You know, it's the biggest one.
[2:56:14.520 --> 2:56:20.640]  You look on their page under, you know, their capability page and their pandemic preparedness
[2:56:20.640 --> 2:56:25.080]  page, and they've got all sorts of plans for medical evacuation, and you name it.
[2:56:25.080 --> 2:56:28.640]  I doubt very seriously the people of that town are going to feel the same way when
[2:56:28.640 --> 2:56:32.200]  there's a flu pandemic or any kind of outbreak or whatever the excuse they want to use, that
[2:56:32.200 --> 2:56:34.400]  the sheriff needs to go around and start rounding people up.
[2:56:34.400 --> 2:56:38.840]  Well, what the locals do, and I want to be clear, we have footage of this.
[2:56:38.840 --> 2:56:42.360]  We're walking down Main Street, every other car stops, people are running up, they're
[2:56:42.360 --> 2:56:48.240]  fans of the show, we run into some great people and hardened, but then the small minority
[2:56:48.240 --> 2:56:53.360]  of fat cats, they would run up and say, you say there's barricades and that flu's been
[2:56:53.360 --> 2:56:54.560]  released here.
[2:56:54.560 --> 2:56:56.560]  We would never say that.
[2:56:56.560 --> 2:57:03.400]  Our guest would bring up the point of, hey, could this be for a flu pandemic?
[2:57:03.400 --> 2:57:05.040]  Why are they policing the town?
[2:57:05.040 --> 2:57:07.400]  Why is the guy, and then they would spin it.
[2:57:07.400 --> 2:57:10.320]  Like they said, mustard was mustard gas.
[2:57:10.320 --> 2:57:12.960]  We didn't even bring up the mustard comment, she did.
[2:57:12.960 --> 2:57:19.320]  And we said, yeah, it said that for alien detainees, it's what they called enemy combatants.
[2:57:19.320 --> 2:57:25.640]  They admitted this, and they spun it that I said aliens were in cryogenic tubes.
[2:57:25.640 --> 2:57:31.480]  So the locals tried to put up a smoke screen, the local boss hogs that wanted this, that
[2:57:31.480 --> 2:57:35.920]  we were talking about aliens and mustard gas and that there were, the town was a giant
[2:57:35.920 --> 2:57:37.200]  FEMA camp.
[2:57:37.200 --> 2:57:43.400]  See, that didn't work, the attorney general, the FBI's after them now, their crap didn't
[2:57:43.400 --> 2:57:44.400]  work.
[2:57:44.400 --> 2:57:48.520]  So what these hucksters do in every case is they just throw out, you're a conspiracy
[2:57:48.520 --> 2:57:52.920]  theorist, but if somebody's walking out of your house with your TV set and your family
[2:57:52.920 --> 2:57:57.200]  jewels, you know, they're robbing you.
[2:57:57.200 --> 2:58:01.280]  It doesn't matter if they call you a conspiracy theorist, that doesn't work at a certain point.
[2:58:01.280 --> 2:58:02.280]  Go ahead.
[2:58:02.280 --> 2:58:07.440]  Oh, I was just going to say, this is not nothing new that the media is doing, and those are
[2:58:07.440 --> 2:58:09.240]  the same terms that they've used over and over again.
[2:58:09.240 --> 2:58:14.880]  You know, several years ago when we put out 911 in plain sight, the back called us up
[2:58:14.880 --> 2:58:19.800]  to go on his program, and we had Dave go on with a photograph that he was supposed to
[2:58:19.800 --> 2:58:25.880]  be able to show on air, and before Dave even get a chance to, you know, provide some information
[2:58:25.880 --> 2:58:31.120]  and some examination, Glenn Beck calls him some kind of a 351 freaking comparison to
[2:58:31.120 --> 2:58:35.960]  an Elvis fighting, you know, he's being Elvis out in the desert at Area 51.
[2:58:35.960 --> 2:58:37.240]  Well, but that's what they do.
[2:58:37.240 --> 2:58:43.280]  They just made up that I said space aliens were there in the newspaper.
[2:58:43.280 --> 2:58:45.760]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[2:58:50.920 --> 2:58:54.240]  Have you ever wanted to generate your own supply of electrical power?
[2:58:54.240 --> 2:58:58.080]  If so, this is going to be the most important message you will ever hear.
[2:58:58.080 --> 2:59:02.560]  Solar power generators are now available from Solutions from Science in Thompson, Illinois.
[2:59:02.560 --> 2:59:07.040]  These emergency backup systems provide life-saving electrical power when you need it most.
[2:59:07.040 --> 2:59:12.160]  Unlike gas generators, a solar generator runs quietly, emits no fumes, and produces electricity
[2:59:12.160 --> 2:59:13.160]  for free.
[2:59:13.160 --> 2:59:16.840]  It's like having an electric power plant running quietly in your own home.
[2:59:16.840 --> 2:59:21.680]  Run some pumps, shortwave radios, computers, and even keep food from spoiling.
[2:59:21.680 --> 2:59:26.040]  Whether it's hurricanes, ice storms, brownouts, or blackouts, you'll never have to suffer
[2:59:26.040 --> 2:59:28.160]  through painful power outages again.
[2:59:28.160 --> 2:59:30.600]  When the power goes out, you'll be ready.
[2:59:30.600 --> 2:59:36.480]  With a solar power generator from Solutions from Science, go to MySolarBackup.com and
[2:59:36.480 --> 2:59:38.360]  get off the grid today.
[2:59:38.360 --> 2:59:44.960]  That's MySolarBackup.com or call 877-327-0365.
[2:59:44.960 --> 2:59:48.960]  877-327-0365.
[2:59:48.960 --> 2:59:49.960]  Don't wait.
[2:59:49.960 --> 2:59:53.960]  Call today.
[2:59:53.960 --> 3:00:16.960]  Waging war on corruption, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[3:00:16.960 --> 3:00:20.960]  Gary Franchi, the producer and the director, name Lewis, join us, Camp FEMA.
[3:00:20.960 --> 3:00:23.960]  We're going to be going to your phone calls right now.
[3:00:23.960 --> 3:00:26.640]  In fact, who's up next here in my list?
[3:00:26.640 --> 3:00:28.640]  Matthew and Oregon?
[3:00:28.640 --> 3:00:32.720]  Matthew and Oregon, then Nelson, Anthony, Kurt, Scott, and others here on the air with
[3:00:32.720 --> 3:00:35.640]  the makers of Camp FEMA, but they can speak about any issue.
[3:00:35.640 --> 3:00:36.640]  Go ahead.
[3:00:36.640 --> 3:00:41.600]  Yes, my name is Matthew McDaniel, and I'm a human rights activist for the OCCA people
[3:00:41.600 --> 3:00:48.200]  in Thailand, and currently I'm riding a horse across the United States from Salem, Oregon,
[3:00:48.200 --> 3:00:55.880]  and I'm about 10 miles west of Wetherford, near Dallas, and I'm just amazed when I go
[3:00:55.880 --> 3:01:04.120]  through these small towns in Texas, post-Texas, Snyder, Texas, and again from Texas, and I
[3:01:04.120 --> 3:01:07.440]  asked the little lady, I said, hey, what's that uniform you got on?
[3:01:07.440 --> 3:01:09.440]  And she said, oh, it's a prison uniform.
[3:01:09.440 --> 3:01:13.440]  I look at the prison, and I said, what, you got a prison here, and you go, yeah, it's
[3:01:13.440 --> 3:01:14.440]  just outside of town?
[3:01:14.440 --> 3:01:15.960]  I said, well, what do you think of that?
[3:01:15.960 --> 3:01:21.400]  She said, well, it's good for jobs, and I was like, you know, they're using these small,
[3:01:21.400 --> 3:01:27.360]  falling apart communities for putting prisons in, and nobody can see them.
[3:01:27.360 --> 3:01:32.920]  And it's not going to get better, it's getting worse, and that's why they're passing laws.
[3:01:32.920 --> 3:01:38.120]  Go to jail for selling eggs, go to jail for garage sales, go to jail for babysitting neighbors'
[3:01:38.120 --> 3:01:39.120]  kids.
[3:01:39.120 --> 3:01:42.480]  They're making everything criminal, and then telling neighbors to spy on neighbors because
[3:01:42.480 --> 3:01:43.560]  they've admitted.
[3:01:43.560 --> 3:01:48.040]  The new economy is going to be in prison or managing the prison.
[3:01:48.040 --> 3:01:54.200]  Well, did you see the article that said they're going to start finding bloggers if they put
[3:01:54.200 --> 3:01:56.200]  misinformation on their blog site?
[3:01:56.200 --> 3:01:58.640]  Yes, I forgot to cover that.
[3:01:58.640 --> 3:02:00.760]  Government agency is going to find you.
[3:02:00.760 --> 3:02:03.960]  It's going to decide what's true and what isn't.
[3:02:03.960 --> 3:02:07.760]  And absolutely, in the State Department, yes, they, and they're going to have a message
[3:02:07.760 --> 3:02:10.040]  that pops up saying your site's not accurate.
[3:02:10.040 --> 3:02:15.520]  I mean, if you say that Iraq didn't have WMDs, they're going to say you're evil and find
[3:02:15.520 --> 3:02:19.440]  you because everybody knows they had nukes.
[3:02:19.440 --> 3:02:25.920]  You have on your website one of my videos from with the Aqa people in Northern Thailand.
[3:02:25.920 --> 3:02:30.560]  Oh, you know, hold on, hold on, hold on, when you mention those people, yeah, they come
[3:02:30.560 --> 3:02:35.040]  in for some tetanus shot after tetanus shot till they have the miscarriage.
[3:02:35.040 --> 3:02:36.720]  So you're the guy that shot those videos.
[3:02:36.720 --> 3:02:37.720]  Right.
[3:02:37.720 --> 3:02:38.720]  That's me.
[3:02:38.720 --> 3:02:44.880]  I documented women who said I was forced to have three tetanus toxoid vaccinations during
[3:02:44.880 --> 3:02:46.880]  one pregnancy.
[3:02:46.880 --> 3:02:51.880]  And while I was nine months pregnant, I got the vaccination and the same day, the baby
[3:02:51.880 --> 3:02:55.400]  stopped moving and the baby came out about eight hours later.
[3:02:55.400 --> 3:03:01.480]  Yeah, you have one after one and the UN has been caught.
[3:03:01.480 --> 3:03:04.920]  The UN has been caught sterilizing people through the shots.
[3:03:04.920 --> 3:03:05.920]  Yeah.
[3:03:05.920 --> 3:03:07.640]  You're almost supposed to get one tetanus shot every seven years.
[3:03:07.640 --> 3:03:11.600]  They give the women three special ones, but they found the tetanus is good to bind the
[3:03:11.600 --> 3:03:14.200]  female hormone to to cause the miscarriage.
[3:03:14.200 --> 3:03:15.200]  That's what the UN's been.
[3:03:15.200 --> 3:03:20.200]  So they're murdering babies, which is what this calls for forced abortion, why, how science
[3:03:20.200 --> 3:03:21.200]  are.
[3:03:21.200 --> 3:03:24.040]  And you're the guy I'd like to have you on as a guest.
[3:03:24.040 --> 3:03:30.360]  Well, it's the thing is they're focusing it on the minorities like the Aqa Hill Tribe.
[3:03:30.360 --> 3:03:36.480]  And we have all these videos on aqa.org, but they're focusing on the Hill Tribe because
[3:03:36.480 --> 3:03:40.720]  you know, I'd ask the nurses, you know, wait, you have a tetanus shot every seven years.
[3:03:40.720 --> 3:03:45.520]  Why are you making the women come in for three shots during each pregnancy?
[3:03:45.520 --> 3:03:49.040]  And they're telling the women if you don't, then there's no ID card for your baby.
[3:03:49.040 --> 3:03:50.040]  That's right.
[3:03:50.040 --> 3:03:51.040]  No welfare, no money.
[3:03:51.040 --> 3:03:55.440]  Yeah, they use the welfare to get to kill them, yeah.
[3:03:55.440 --> 3:04:00.880]  And so what we're doing now is we're doing a national protest march about the human
[3:04:00.880 --> 3:04:05.160]  rights conditions of the aqas by going across the U.S. by horseback.
[3:04:05.160 --> 3:04:10.080]  My wife, she's aqa, and we got five little kids in a bus that says ride for freedom.
[3:04:10.080 --> 3:04:15.840]  And you know, the other thing we got a big problem with is all these American missionaries
[3:04:15.840 --> 3:04:21.640]  going to Northern Thailand and taking away aqa kids and telling their churches that they're
[3:04:21.640 --> 3:04:22.640]  orphans.
[3:04:22.640 --> 3:04:25.040]  If you want to see a big fraud in action.
[3:04:25.040 --> 3:04:28.320]  Well, child kidnap is what America does.
[3:04:28.320 --> 3:04:31.200]  We kidnap our own kids, we kidnap everybody else's kids.
[3:04:31.200 --> 3:04:32.200]  Hell, they're lucky.
[3:04:32.200 --> 3:04:34.400]  They just don't go to Iraq and just murder everybody.
[3:04:34.400 --> 3:04:35.720]  I mean, that's what we do.
[3:04:35.720 --> 3:04:40.920]  We poison our own people, we murder everybody and we make TV ads celebrating ourselves saying
[3:04:40.920 --> 3:04:41.920]  how good we are.
[3:04:41.920 --> 3:04:43.920]  Sir, I'm going to put you on hold.
[3:04:43.920 --> 3:04:44.920]  Give me your name and info.
[3:04:44.920 --> 3:04:47.120]  I recognize your voice from the videos.
[3:04:47.120 --> 3:04:48.120]  Great job you're doing.
[3:04:48.120 --> 3:04:51.280]  We should have you on sometime from the landline about what's going on there.
[3:04:51.280 --> 3:04:55.400]  We're going to come back with Gary Franche and William Lewis of Camp FEMA continue talking
[3:04:55.400 --> 3:04:59.880]  about their film, Camp FEMA, American Lockdown, available at infowars.com.
[3:04:59.880 --> 3:05:00.880]  Stay with us.
[3:05:00.880 --> 3:05:04.680]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[3:05:04.680 --> 3:05:09.040]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition
[3:05:09.040 --> 3:05:10.040]  do you want?
[3:05:10.040 --> 3:05:15.560]  My answer would be all I can get in the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones.
[3:05:15.560 --> 3:05:17.040]  Food is your only ammunition.
[3:05:17.040 --> 3:05:18.280]  How much do you want?
[3:05:18.280 --> 3:05:19.280]  When do you want it?
[3:05:19.280 --> 3:05:21.320]  Now or after the battle starts.
[3:05:21.320 --> 3:05:22.440]  When will you need it?
[3:05:22.440 --> 3:05:24.560]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[3:05:24.560 --> 3:05:25.880]  Will there be any food?
[3:05:25.880 --> 3:05:27.360]  Will it make your children sick?
[3:05:27.360 --> 3:05:31.520]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center
[3:05:31.520 --> 3:05:32.680]  and be immunized?
[3:05:32.680 --> 3:05:36.440]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[3:05:36.440 --> 3:05:40.040]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[3:05:40.040 --> 3:05:41.280]  How much will you need?
[3:05:41.280 --> 3:05:42.280]  We don't know.
[3:05:42.280 --> 3:05:43.280]  How much do you want?
[3:05:43.280 --> 3:05:44.280]  All you can get.
[3:05:44.280 --> 3:05:45.280]  I'm Alex Jones.
[3:05:45.280 --> 3:05:48.440]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[3:05:48.440 --> 3:05:56.000]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at eFoodsDirect.com.
[3:05:56.000 --> 3:06:00.680]  And that number, 1-800-409-5633.
[3:06:00.680 --> 3:06:05.320]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want
[3:06:05.320 --> 3:06:06.320]  you to eat.
[3:06:06.320 --> 3:06:09.840]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you
[3:06:09.840 --> 3:06:10.840]  sick?
[3:06:10.840 --> 3:06:12.800]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[3:06:12.800 --> 3:06:14.440]  You don't have to cooperate.
[3:06:14.440 --> 3:06:15.640]  There is a solution.
[3:06:15.640 --> 3:06:19.320]  Inner Health Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing

[3:06:36.720 --> 3:06:37.720]  manager.

[3:07:01.280 --> 3:07:05.140]  How many times have you been in a situation where having a hidden audio or video recorder
[3:07:05.140 --> 3:07:07.160]  would have made a difference in your life?
[3:07:07.160 --> 3:07:11.200]  In the past, owning a hidden video recorder has been expensive and too much of a bother
[3:07:11.200 --> 3:07:12.360]  to carry.
[3:07:12.360 --> 3:07:13.600]  That was then.
[3:07:13.600 --> 3:07:14.800]  This is now.
[3:07:14.800 --> 3:07:17.560]  Introducing Diginette Spy Sunglasses.
[3:07:17.560 --> 3:07:22.160]  These sunglasses contain a small hidden camera that will record up to four hours of real-time
[3:07:22.160 --> 3:07:23.600]  audio and video.
[3:07:23.600 --> 3:07:28.280]  The Diginette Sunglasses are perfect for traffic stops, unlawful searches and seizures, town
[3:07:28.280 --> 3:07:32.840]  hall meetings, proving your innocence, or any other situation you'd like to record.
[3:07:32.840 --> 3:07:36.240]  And if sunglasses aren't for you, check out the DigiPen.
[3:07:36.240 --> 3:07:40.960]  It does the same great job as the sunglasses, but in the form of a functional pen.

[3:08:03.000 --> 3:08:09.560]  From his central Texas command center deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[3:08:09.560 --> 3:08:31.920]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[3:08:31.920 --> 3:08:36.800]  We are back live, ladies and gentlemen, and we're continuing taking your phone calls with
[3:08:36.800 --> 3:08:41.960]  Gary Franchi and, of course, the director of the film, William Lewis Camp Fima.
[3:08:41.960 --> 3:08:47.960]  Guys, shifting gears, they have all these different excuses to set up a police state.
[3:08:47.960 --> 3:08:51.160]  Shadowy men want to kill you overseas, we've got to set up Homeland Security.
[3:08:51.160 --> 3:08:56.720]  Then we get the documents, Homeland Security set up for the American people, Brigade Homeland,
[3:08:56.720 --> 3:08:58.640]  you cover all that in Camp Fima.
[3:08:58.640 --> 3:09:01.800]  Now they're saying, oh, yes, we want to forcibly inoculate you.
[3:09:01.800 --> 3:09:05.920]  They're admitting the first 10 million people are going to get a nasal spray of a live virus
[3:09:05.920 --> 3:09:07.160]  that spreads it.
[3:09:07.160 --> 3:09:08.160]  That's mainstream news.
[3:09:08.160 --> 3:09:13.000]  I mean, this is getting crazier and crazier and crazier by the minute.
[3:09:13.000 --> 3:09:18.680]  Alex, you know, I just got an email here from one of your listeners, and he says that he
[3:09:18.680 --> 3:09:22.560]  was one of the early birds who pre-ordered Camp Fima considering that this kind of subject
[3:09:22.560 --> 3:09:27.960]  matter can be difficult to present in a way that can be digested by ordinary people.
[3:09:27.960 --> 3:09:31.280]  He thought that it would be another movie that could not only show, he could only show
[3:09:31.280 --> 3:09:36.160]  to a small percentage of his friends, but he says, after watching Camp Fima, he says,
[3:09:36.160 --> 3:09:40.760]  I'd like to give you both the very highest acknowledgment for making a truly great film.
[3:09:40.760 --> 3:09:46.120]  Your presentation is methodical, easy to follow, the historical perspective is well-researched
[3:09:46.120 --> 3:09:50.280]  and extremely valuable in understanding how government has come to where it currently
[3:09:50.280 --> 3:09:51.280]  is.
[3:09:51.280 --> 3:09:53.040]  The facts are solid and irrefutable.
[3:09:53.040 --> 3:09:57.680]  I feel you have made a brilliant film talking with normal Americans about FEMA camps is
[3:09:57.680 --> 3:09:58.680]  a difficult thing.
[3:09:58.680 --> 3:10:02.720]  However, you presented it in a way here that people will understand.
[3:10:02.720 --> 3:10:03.720]  Thank you so much.
[3:10:03.720 --> 3:10:08.200]  I hope to be going and getting more copies soon to show to friends.
[3:10:08.200 --> 3:10:12.640]  Well, you know, that's what I made the Obama deception to do is to shatter the left-right
[3:10:12.640 --> 3:10:15.480]  paradigm to show people how both parties are controlled.
[3:10:15.480 --> 3:10:18.600]  And you do this in a matter of fact, like mainline television.
[3:10:18.600 --> 3:10:19.600]  Here's the history of FEMA.
[3:10:19.600 --> 3:10:20.760]  Here's Congress.
[3:10:20.760 --> 3:10:21.760]  Here's what they're doing.
[3:10:21.760 --> 3:10:25.120]  They admit the camps because they admit it out of one side of their mouth, but in a
[3:10:25.120 --> 3:10:29.040]  good light and then deny it when we say we don't want camps.
[3:10:29.040 --> 3:10:30.600]  And so you really expose that.
[3:10:30.600 --> 3:10:31.600]  Continue.
[3:10:31.600 --> 3:10:36.360]  I don't say it's not an easy topic to cover.
[3:10:36.360 --> 3:10:42.880]  I just wanted to point out that, you know, we break the film down into FEMA's three basic
[3:10:42.880 --> 3:10:45.000]  prime directives.
[3:10:45.000 --> 3:10:49.800]  Their directive number one is national emergency recovery like tornadoes, floods, earthquakes.
[3:10:49.800 --> 3:10:54.560]  We go in and take a look at how they've done those jobs in the past and give them a grade.
[3:10:54.560 --> 3:10:58.200]  And then we go in and look at their other directive, which is continuity of government,
[3:10:58.200 --> 3:11:01.920]  protecting the country from terrorism and nuclear attacks and things of that nature that they've
[3:11:01.920 --> 3:11:07.200]  been doing for 30-some-odd years now, you know, how have they done on that.
[3:11:07.200 --> 3:11:11.720]  And then finally, directive three, which is a good portion of documentary, that this one
[3:11:11.720 --> 3:11:16.520]  is combating perceived threats to the existing social and political order.
[3:11:16.520 --> 3:11:18.360]  And you know, we didn't just make that up.
[3:11:18.360 --> 3:11:20.280]  We didn't just pull that out of a hat.
[3:11:20.280 --> 3:11:26.600]  That phrase, the existing social and political order and the threat that they perceive to
[3:11:26.600 --> 3:11:32.720]  it is listed throughout the documentation that we found in Senate Select Committee hearings,
[3:11:32.720 --> 3:11:38.080]  FBI documentation, and this mimics what we see in the Department of Homeland Security
[3:11:38.080 --> 3:11:40.080]  report and the MIAC reports.
[3:11:40.080 --> 3:11:41.440]  So this is nothing new.
[3:11:41.440 --> 3:11:45.440]  It's just laid out in a way where people can, for the first time, put those puzzle pieces
[3:11:45.440 --> 3:11:52.240]  together in a way that makes sense.
[3:11:52.240 --> 3:11:56.080]  So what do we do about the FEMA camps?
[3:11:56.080 --> 3:12:00.720]  I mean, they're just building this whole infrastructure, turning our whole society into a prison.
[3:12:00.720 --> 3:12:04.800]  It's all admitted, but they're still in denial.
[3:12:04.800 --> 3:12:07.360]  We have to resist every corner.
[3:12:07.360 --> 3:12:10.680]  We have to resist every corner, critical mass, spreading information.
[3:12:10.680 --> 3:12:16.720]  Alex, it's about waking up the people, that's the bottom line, you know, without an informed
[3:12:16.720 --> 3:12:21.000]  populace, you know, and without winning the court of public opinion, we're going to lose
[3:12:21.000 --> 3:12:22.000]  this battle.
[3:12:22.000 --> 3:12:25.280]  You know, I commend you, Alex, for the work you're doing, for the films you're putting
[3:12:25.280 --> 3:12:29.680]  out, for the message you're hitting home to people, you know, it's a collective effort
[3:12:29.680 --> 3:12:34.840]  across the spectrum of the movement, you know, to wake up the American people, to get us
[3:12:34.840 --> 3:12:39.720]  organized, to get us activated, and taking back this country.
[3:12:39.720 --> 3:12:44.720]  That's what we've got to do.
[3:12:44.720 --> 3:12:53.600]  Well, all I know is, it's clear that we have a criminal establishment in control setting
[3:12:53.600 --> 3:12:58.440]  up a scientific dictatorship, and things are only going to get worse until people say
[3:12:58.440 --> 3:12:59.440]  no.
[3:12:59.440 --> 3:13:02.840]  You know, the biggest issue is the worship of police, the worship of surveillance in
[3:13:02.840 --> 3:13:06.680]  the media, as if these were the modern heroes, greater than Michael Jordan, greater than
[3:13:06.680 --> 3:13:07.680]  John Wayne.
[3:13:07.680 --> 3:13:12.920]  I mean, it's really sick, it's predatory, there's all these reports of police robbing
[3:13:12.920 --> 3:13:16.480]  people all over the country, don't even get in trouble.
[3:13:16.480 --> 3:13:21.000]  I know they're good police, but they're mainly used as the cover by the corrupt system itself
[3:13:21.000 --> 3:13:22.640]  to continue operating.
[3:13:22.640 --> 3:13:28.720]  Well, you know, up in Canada, there was a friend of mine who was, who uncovered a drug-smuggling
[3:13:28.720 --> 3:13:31.920]  operation by the Ontario police, named Scott Loper.
[3:13:31.920 --> 3:13:37.160]  You know, they threw him into a prison, they tortured him for 40 years, and never provided
[3:13:37.160 --> 3:13:41.080]  him access to the embassy or the State Department, violated international treaty.
[3:13:41.080 --> 3:13:50.160]  So, I mean, the corruption is worldwide, Alex, and you know this, it's sick.
[3:13:50.160 --> 3:13:51.160]  Continue along that line.
[3:13:51.160 --> 3:13:57.880]  Well, like, okay, you know, Scott, Scott was a police officer, he investigated criminal
[3:13:57.880 --> 3:14:04.680]  activities in New Jersey, moved up to Canada, discovered his drug-smuggling operation, his
[3:14:04.680 --> 3:14:09.280]  family was taken away from him, trumped up charges, his child was abducted, they still
[3:14:09.280 --> 3:14:14.480]  don't know where the kid is, and now he's fighting the State Department to get justice.
[3:14:14.480 --> 3:14:16.720]  The State Department's denying him.
[3:14:16.720 --> 3:14:21.760]  I mean, all the documents are there, check it out at scottlopersstory.com.
[3:14:21.760 --> 3:14:23.240]  It's a horrible thing.
[3:14:23.240 --> 3:14:30.920]  You know, and just one man trying to get justice, trying to expose corruption.
[3:14:30.920 --> 3:14:42.200]  Well, when the history's written on all this, for better or worse, it's going to get a lot
[3:14:42.200 --> 3:14:43.840]  worse before it gets better.
[3:14:43.840 --> 3:14:45.040]  People are going to wish they'd done more.
[3:14:45.040 --> 3:14:49.360]  I mean, when they're openly announcing no free speech in America, and they won't issue
[3:14:49.360 --> 3:14:53.160]  permits, first they say you've got to have a permit that turns a right into a privilege,
[3:14:53.160 --> 3:14:58.000]  then they start not issuing the permits, just like they did with gun permits in New York
[3:14:58.000 --> 3:14:59.000]  City.
[3:14:59.000 --> 3:15:02.920]  I mean, this is hardcore tyranny, this is communist China.
[3:15:02.920 --> 3:15:11.000]  Well, it is, Alex, and it's up to the people to stand up to this tyranny.
[3:15:11.000 --> 3:15:15.720]  When I look at my children or my grandchildren in the future, I want to say that I fought
[3:15:15.720 --> 3:15:20.960]  for freedom, that I fought for America, that I fought so that they could be raised and
[3:15:20.960 --> 3:15:25.680]  live in a world, live in America where freedom is not a slogan, it's not a catchphrase, but
[3:15:25.680 --> 3:15:28.400]  it's an actual reality that we can embrace.
[3:15:28.400 --> 3:15:30.600]  And that's what I fight for every day, Alex.
[3:15:30.600 --> 3:15:35.480]  That's why we put out these films, magazines, websites, webinars, whatever it may be to
[3:15:35.480 --> 3:15:39.600]  push the message forward to organize the people, because I'm not going to sit back and say,
[3:15:39.600 --> 3:15:40.600]  I did nothing.
[3:15:40.600 --> 3:15:47.280]  I'm going to fight for this country, Alex.
[3:15:47.280 --> 3:15:48.720]  Let's take some calls here.
[3:15:48.720 --> 3:15:52.880]  Let's go ahead and take a call from Nelson in California.
[3:15:52.880 --> 3:15:54.600]  Nelson, you're on the air.
[3:15:54.600 --> 3:15:56.200]  Hey, how are you doing, Alex?
[3:15:56.200 --> 3:16:00.320]  This is my third time calling, and I'm from a We Are Change LA.
[3:16:00.320 --> 3:16:06.320]  I was calling to, in regards to a previous caller who was talking about the New Michael
[3:16:06.320 --> 3:16:07.320]  Moore movie.
[3:16:07.320 --> 3:16:13.200]  I actually went and saw it, and it was pretty bad, but really bad.
[3:16:13.200 --> 3:16:19.720]  But I made a spoof poster, and I sent it to you through your advertising link.
[3:16:19.720 --> 3:16:26.160]  I don't know if you got it, but I made a spoof that where I changed Michael Moore into you
[3:16:26.160 --> 3:16:29.200]  and heckling Adam with their bullhorn.
[3:16:29.200 --> 3:16:37.080]  And the other thing I connected was that Michael Moore's talent agent is Rami Manuel's brother,
[3:16:37.080 --> 3:16:38.080]  Ari Emanuel.
[3:16:38.080 --> 3:16:39.640]  I don't know if you're aware of that.
[3:16:39.640 --> 3:16:40.640]  Were you?
[3:16:40.640 --> 3:16:46.840]  Yes, but I mean, I'm not defending Michael Moore because he's anti-second amendment.
[3:16:46.840 --> 3:16:50.760]  He's saying corporate system, the capitalism did this.
[3:16:50.760 --> 3:16:53.600]  This is just corporate robbery that did this.
[3:16:53.600 --> 3:16:56.240]  His answer of communism is what the elites want.
[3:16:56.240 --> 3:17:03.280]  They take our wealth and give it to themselves, but he's one of the biggest agents in Hollywood.
[3:17:03.280 --> 3:17:05.800]  And so, yeah, you're going to have people like that involved.
[3:17:05.800 --> 3:17:10.840]  Yes, I have seen that in the news, and yes, he's got a whole agenda pushing government
[3:17:10.840 --> 3:17:14.800]  health care, seizing 20% of what's left of the market.
[3:17:14.800 --> 3:17:19.200]  Of course, the insurance companies are corrupt, too, because they've used government regulation
[3:17:19.200 --> 3:17:20.880]  to allow that corruption.
[3:17:20.880 --> 3:17:25.400]  Before government got involved, 50 years ago, we were the apple of the world's eye.
[3:17:25.400 --> 3:17:31.200]  So we need less government, not more government.
[3:17:31.200 --> 3:17:36.960]  And you've got Rami Manuel's other brother is advising the White House on the death panels
[3:17:36.960 --> 3:17:42.120]  and openly give speeches about, you know, the case for getting rid of granny.
[3:17:42.120 --> 3:17:43.440]  And so, yeah, it's pretty creepy.
[3:17:43.440 --> 3:17:44.680]  I appreciate your call.
[3:17:44.680 --> 3:17:48.040]  There's all these interconnections in this whole power structure.
[3:17:48.040 --> 3:17:51.040]  And they're Gary Franchi and Mr. Lewis.
[3:17:51.040 --> 3:17:52.960]  Oh, no question.
[3:17:52.960 --> 3:17:58.520]  And, you know, in the mainstream media that's worth so frightening, I just got a report
[3:17:58.520 --> 3:18:04.680]  that Camp FEMA was hand-delivered to Glenn Beck at a recent book signing, you know, and
[3:18:04.680 --> 3:18:10.120]  there is a special segment on Glenn Beck, as you know, Alex, in the film.
[3:18:10.120 --> 3:18:15.680]  So we anticipate something coming out of Glenn Beck if he even decides to watch the film.
[3:18:15.680 --> 3:18:20.600]  But when he, when the film was handed to him, he was told that the film was made in response
[3:18:20.600 --> 3:18:22.960]  to his message.
[3:18:22.960 --> 3:18:27.200]  So should be interesting to see what you know, it's sad about Glenn Beck, you know, muser
[3:18:27.200 --> 3:18:34.480]  fans of the show, the lead singer main songwriter as Mr. Bellamy's been on the show.
[3:18:34.480 --> 3:18:42.360]  And we've inspired their work, but we've inspired mega death and a lot of other groups.
[3:18:42.360 --> 3:18:49.200]  But, but, but the issue is that Beck came out last week and endorsed it and said he loved
[3:18:49.200 --> 3:18:50.200]  the message.
[3:18:50.200 --> 3:18:52.160]  And they said, remove your endorsement.
[3:18:52.160 --> 3:18:55.200]  You're an establishment lackey trying to co-opt our movement.
[3:18:55.200 --> 3:18:59.040]  So the good news is anybody with half a brain knows that Beck's a phony.
[3:18:59.040 --> 3:19:04.480]  He does a lot of good work, but he only does that to get you under his control so he can
[3:19:04.480 --> 3:19:06.280]  then deny key issues.
[3:19:06.280 --> 3:19:12.320]  Remember, when Ron Paul had a chance of winning, it was Glenn Beck sunken more than anybody.
[3:19:12.320 --> 3:19:17.880]  And now that Ron Paul can't become president right now, he loves him.
[3:19:17.880 --> 3:19:19.400]  He is a Judas Iscariot.
[3:19:19.400 --> 3:19:20.400]  He is a Benedict Arnold.
[3:19:20.400 --> 3:19:26.080]  Well, gentlemen, I want to commend you on the film, Camp FEMA, available at infowars.com.
[3:19:26.080 --> 3:19:30.120]  Hope everybody gets it, shows their friends and family can also call toll free to get
[3:19:30.120 --> 3:19:31.120]  it.
[3:19:31.120 --> 3:19:32.120]  888-253-3139.
[3:19:32.120 --> 3:19:38.720]  While you're calling, you can also order Paul the Republic that ships in, what are we talking
[3:19:38.720 --> 3:19:41.560]  about, 15 days here or earlier?
[3:19:41.560 --> 3:19:47.280]  Comes out October 21st, 888-253-3139.
[3:19:47.280 --> 3:19:51.000]  I want to thank both of you for the great job you've done and we'll talk to you again
[3:19:51.000 --> 3:19:52.000]  soon.
[3:19:52.000 --> 3:19:53.000]  Thank you, Gary Franchi and William Luz.
[3:19:53.000 --> 3:19:58.400]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen, financial news, more flu news, your phone
[3:19:58.400 --> 3:20:01.920]  calls.
[3:20:01.920 --> 3:20:05.080]  Have you ever felt like the United States government knows way too much about your financial
[3:20:05.080 --> 3:20:06.080]  affairs?
[3:20:06.080 --> 3:20:10.320]  I continue to hear stories about property seizures, frozen bank accounts, confiscation
[3:20:10.320 --> 3:20:11.840]  of stocks and bonds.
[3:20:11.840 --> 3:20:15.840]  It makes me wonder if the U.S. citizen will ever again have the right to life, liberty
[3:20:15.840 --> 3:20:17.600]  and the pursuit of happiness.
[3:20:17.600 --> 3:20:23.480]  Unfortunately, with the Drug and Money Laundering Act, the IRS Revenue ruling 6045 of 1984,
[3:20:23.480 --> 3:20:28.080]  and the Trading with the Enemy Act in Franklin D. Roosevelt's executive order of 1933, some
[3:20:28.080 --> 3:20:31.520]  precious metal holdings are subject to government intervention.
[3:20:31.520 --> 3:20:35.520]  For this reason, Midas Resources has prepared a report explaining the boundaries of trading
[3:20:35.520 --> 3:20:37.040]  precious metals privately.
[3:20:37.040 --> 3:20:40.880]  Whether if you have any intention of trading with Midas Resources or not, I have instructed
[3:20:40.880 --> 3:20:43.800]  my representatives to give this report out free.
[3:20:43.800 --> 3:20:47.720]  Call for your free copy at 1-800-686-2237.
[3:20:47.720 --> 3:20:50.000]  When investing, always proceed with caution.
[3:20:50.000 --> 3:20:54.200]  Again, call 1-800-686-2237.
[3:20:54.200 --> 3:20:56.920]  Exercise your legal right to trade metals privately.
[3:20:56.920 --> 3:20:57.920]  1-800-686-2237.
[3:20:57.920 --> 3:20:58.920]  May I have everybody's attention, please?
[3:20:58.920 --> 3:21:07.920]  I've come with a message of information, 9-11 was an inside job.
[3:21:07.920 --> 3:21:09.720]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[3:21:09.720 --> 3:21:11.320]  Do you like being a puppet from the New World Order?
[3:21:11.320 --> 3:21:14.320]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a stage?
[3:21:14.320 --> 3:21:18.400]  It was engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Thrallateral Commission, the CAF, the
[3:21:18.400 --> 3:21:29.920]  National Security Council, the United States and the United States of America.
[3:21:29.920 --> 3:21:37.140]  7 years after the attacks of September 11, a global awakening has taken place.
[3:21:37.140 --> 3:21:38.140]  An inside job?
[3:21:38.140 --> 3:21:39.140]  How dare you?
[3:21:39.140 --> 3:21:40.140]  I don't think what the government suggested in 9-11.
[3:21:40.140 --> 3:21:43.940]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[3:21:43.940 --> 3:21:46.980]  The whole hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[3:21:46.980 --> 3:22:04.580]  When you hear the words water purification, what comes to mind?
[3:22:04.580 --> 3:22:08.540]  If it's Berkey water purification systems, this message is for you.
[3:22:08.540 --> 3:22:13.300]  Did you know that over 60% of municipal water contains fluoride at less than 2 cents per

[3:22:14.300 --> 3:22:18.620]  Big Berkey water filters purify treated and untreated water, remove dangerous chlorine
[3:22:18.620 --> 3:22:21.340]  fluoride and contaminants from municipal water.

[3:22:25.660 --> 3:22:27.460]  rainwater collection systems.

[3:23:02.660 --> 3:23:04.660]  Remain in your houses.
[3:23:04.660 --> 3:23:10.500]  The president of the United States has declared martial law under executive order 11,004.
[3:23:10.500 --> 3:23:11.500]  Will they do it?
[3:23:11.500 --> 3:23:14.420]  Will they pull the trigger this time?
[3:23:14.420 --> 3:23:20.060]  We all pray they stand down, but an engineered crisis seems more likely with each passing
[3:23:20.060 --> 3:23:21.060]  day.
[3:23:21.060 --> 3:23:23.500]  Think it can't happen here?
[3:23:23.500 --> 3:23:27.700]  Executive order 10-9-90 locks down all highways.
[3:23:27.700 --> 3:23:32.580]  Executive order 10-9-95 ceases control of all media outlets.
[3:23:32.580 --> 3:23:37.140]  Executive order 10-9-98 controls all farms and food supplies.
[3:23:37.140 --> 3:23:42.900]  All these executive orders are now cocked, loaded and waiting for the right crisis.
[3:23:42.900 --> 3:23:47.060]  So if you're worried about the possibility of martial law here in America or have questions
[3:23:47.060 --> 3:23:51.460]  about how to survive it, go to martiallawsurvival.com.

[3:23:56.900 --> 3:24:02.900]  You must remain in your houses until your bracelets are scanned.
[3:24:02.900 --> 3:24:09.860]  Okay, here's the deal.
[3:24:09.860 --> 3:24:16.700]  I want to continue with your phone calls.
[3:24:16.700 --> 3:24:20.620]  More and more, I'm sitting there listening to our last guest.
[3:24:20.620 --> 3:24:24.020]  I'm thinking, why are we having to even fight FEMA camps?
[3:24:24.020 --> 3:24:27.140]  Why are we even having to fight mercenaries?
[3:24:27.140 --> 3:24:31.900]  Why are we even having to deal with face scanning cameras and AP headlines?
[3:24:31.900 --> 3:24:35.540]  National police chiefs call for neighbors to spy on neighbors.
[3:24:35.540 --> 3:24:40.260]  And then I'm in Billings, Montana, and the third floor elevator opens, and it's police
[3:24:40.260 --> 3:24:44.980]  and homeland security banners with hundreds of Girl Scouts.
[3:24:44.980 --> 3:24:48.340]  And I step out of the elevator dazed.
[3:24:48.340 --> 3:24:52.260]  I mean, you know, it's so insane.
[3:24:52.260 --> 3:24:55.020]  It's so evil.
[3:24:55.020 --> 3:25:00.580]  And these crazy cops and crazy spies and crazy un-American people will go, we're stopping
[3:25:00.580 --> 3:25:01.580]  drugs.
[3:25:01.580 --> 3:25:07.460]  We're stopping terrorists when you stage the terror in almost every case, when you ship
[3:25:07.460 --> 3:25:08.460]  the drugs in.
[3:25:08.460 --> 3:25:09.460]  It's all on record.
[3:25:09.460 --> 3:25:11.420]  I mean, give me a break.
[3:25:11.420 --> 3:25:14.420]  Leave me alone.
[3:25:14.420 --> 3:25:18.020]  I already don't go downtown Austin hardly ever to even though they got good restaurants
[3:25:18.020 --> 3:25:22.380]  down there because I don't want to be around the thug downtown cops.
[3:25:22.380 --> 3:25:25.620]  What am I going to do when they say now they take blood randomly at checkpoints?
[3:25:25.620 --> 3:25:28.860]  They're announcing in Canada and England, they're going to randomly take breathalyzers
[3:25:28.860 --> 3:25:31.220]  and blood randomly.
[3:25:31.220 --> 3:25:34.260]  What do I do when the cop goes, I'm going to stick a needle in your arm, boy.
[3:25:34.260 --> 3:25:41.340]  I mean, it's just they keep pushing and pushing and pushing and pushing and pushing and pushing.
[3:25:41.340 --> 3:25:46.740]  And they work for offshore banks that are openly killing the dollar that have openly
[3:25:46.740 --> 3:25:53.380]  doubled the credit card rates to 30% who are openly setting up world government and are
[3:25:53.380 --> 3:25:56.580]  going to tax carbon dioxide.
[3:25:56.580 --> 3:25:58.060]  We've been tracking gold today.
[3:25:58.060 --> 3:26:07.580]  It's broke the all-time record by over $10 of over $1,041 today, $1,041 today.
[3:26:07.580 --> 3:26:08.860]  I haven't looked at it in the last hour.
[3:26:08.860 --> 3:26:13.140]  I wanted to briefly have Ted Anderson come in, Midas Resources, 30 years in the gold
[3:26:13.140 --> 3:26:19.620]  and silver business, Ted's had minus for 12, Ted, what is going on right now?
[3:26:19.620 --> 3:26:22.180]  Well, I'm watching the market just like you are, Alex.
[3:26:22.180 --> 3:26:26.740]  I mean, the market right now is sitting at 1,040 and change.
[3:26:26.740 --> 3:26:31.660]  The sellers have tried to bring the prices down into the 1,030 range, but it keeps bouncing
[3:26:31.660 --> 3:26:33.300]  right back up again.
[3:26:33.300 --> 3:26:36.860]  This all started in the middle of the night while we were sleeping.
[3:26:36.860 --> 3:26:43.940]  The Arab countries decided to join on with this UN thing to bring down the United States
[3:26:43.940 --> 3:26:46.740]  dollar and go to a basket of currencies.
[3:26:46.740 --> 3:26:51.220]  And since then, the dollar has just been plummeting and gold has been going up.
[3:26:51.220 --> 3:26:56.940]  And we've seen a high of 1,044 now today, and it's been very strong.
[3:26:56.940 --> 3:27:00.580]  I mean, I got to tell you, I'm really happy to see that there's a lot of people taking
[3:27:00.580 --> 3:27:02.580]  advantage of the offers we have right now.
[3:27:02.580 --> 3:27:04.980]  I mean, people are finally coming to their senses.
[3:27:04.980 --> 3:27:10.540]  I don't know, I hate to have to motivate people by fear because they should be using
[3:27:10.540 --> 3:27:11.780]  their head.
[3:27:11.780 --> 3:27:17.660]  But here's the thing, here's the news story, the United States dollar is in trouble.
[3:27:17.660 --> 3:27:21.820]  And there's nothing really that we can do about it because we've gone so far into debt
[3:27:21.820 --> 3:27:25.700]  that we rely on foreign nations in order to finance our economy.
[3:27:25.700 --> 3:27:29.540]  And now we're watching the dollar fall in value because the foreigners that have been
[3:27:29.540 --> 3:27:33.660]  financing this for us are deciding they don't want to have any more of it.
[3:27:33.660 --> 3:27:37.940]  They want to sell the debt that they already have, the loans that they've already given
[3:27:37.940 --> 3:27:39.940]  us, which means the dollar falls.
[3:27:39.940 --> 3:27:41.660]  I mean, that's just simply it.
[3:27:41.660 --> 3:27:45.340]  Man, if you're sitting in the bank, if you have some money in the stock market, if you're
[3:27:45.340 --> 3:27:51.060]  looking at anything that has to do with US currency, man, all I can say is you better
[3:27:51.060 --> 3:27:55.540]  take a real serious look at what you have because before this is done, we could be like
[3:27:55.540 --> 3:28:02.180]  Argentina where you're sitting at 40% of your value of what you had just a year ago.
[3:28:02.180 --> 3:28:08.340]  You know, I mean, they were a nation superpower back in the day, and then all of a sudden
[3:28:08.340 --> 3:28:14.100]  they went into this deficit spiral, and now their currency is almost worthless.
[3:28:14.100 --> 3:28:15.780]  And that's what the United States is doing.
[3:28:15.780 --> 3:28:16.780]  It's just identical.
[3:28:16.780 --> 3:28:18.820]  I mean, that's not the only country.
[3:28:18.820 --> 3:28:24.780]  I mean, look, Mexico did Argentina, Brazil, you know, there's Venezuela, there's countries
[3:28:24.780 --> 3:28:29.980]  in Africa, obviously, I mean, the world doesn't want the United States dollar anymore.
[3:28:29.980 --> 3:28:33.460]  They don't want to be dominated by the United States anymore, they'd like to get away from
[3:28:33.460 --> 3:28:34.460]  that.
[3:28:34.460 --> 3:28:40.140]  And unfortunately, us here as citizens, whether assets tied up in US dollar are going to take
[3:28:40.140 --> 3:28:43.140]  the hit.
[3:28:43.140 --> 3:28:44.140]  Absolutely.
[3:28:44.140 --> 3:28:45.140]  Absolutely.
[3:28:45.140 --> 3:28:47.700]  Ted, where is gold right now?
[3:28:47.700 --> 3:28:50.540]  Well, right now, gold is at 1040 and change.
[3:28:50.540 --> 3:28:54.900]  I'd looked at it just before I walked in, it was like 1040 and 40 cents.
[3:28:54.900 --> 3:29:00.260]  I can tell you right now, Alex, the stuff that I've accumulated here at that 940, the
[3:29:00.260 --> 3:29:03.740]  988 to 940 level is going to be gone.
[3:29:03.740 --> 3:29:04.740]  And you know what?
[3:29:04.740 --> 3:29:08.260]  My prices, I'm looking at the wholesale prices to me right now, I have to pay a tremendous
[3:29:08.260 --> 3:29:10.420]  amount more for the same stuff.
[3:29:10.420 --> 3:29:11.900]  You know, I can't say it enough.
[3:29:11.900 --> 3:29:14.660]  I really want people to get into gold and silver.
[3:29:14.660 --> 3:29:18.900]  It is a big enough train wreck for everybody in the entire nation to recognize that it's
[3:29:18.900 --> 3:29:19.900]  common now.
[3:29:19.900 --> 3:29:22.740]  Don't mess around with your future.
[3:29:22.740 --> 3:29:23.940]  This is it.
[3:29:23.940 --> 3:29:26.100]  We have the handwriting on the wall.
[3:29:26.100 --> 3:29:27.100]  I don't know.
[3:29:27.100 --> 3:29:28.100]  Absolutely.
[3:29:28.100 --> 3:29:29.100]  Let me give them the number.
[3:29:29.100 --> 3:29:30.100]  800-686-2237.
[3:29:30.100 --> 3:29:31.100]  800-686-2237.
[3:29:31.100 --> 3:29:44.780]  Ted's running this deal up until three o'clock today, I guess when the show ends, 800-686-2237.
[3:29:44.780 --> 3:29:47.660]  Do not procrastinate, ladies and gentlemen.
[3:29:47.660 --> 3:29:50.500]  We'll talk to Ted on the other side if he can hold a little bit longer.
[3:29:50.500 --> 3:29:51.900]  We'll find out together.
[3:29:51.900 --> 3:29:53.180]  We're on the march.
[3:29:53.180 --> 3:29:55.580]  The Empire's on the run.
[3:29:55.580 --> 3:30:01.300]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[3:30:01.300 --> 3:30:05.180]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones and I want each of you to ask yourself this question.
[3:30:05.180 --> 3:30:07.540]  Do you really know what's in your tap water?
[3:30:07.540 --> 3:30:13.140]  In a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor, they found that over 260 chemicals
[3:30:13.140 --> 3:30:16.180]  in pollutants are present in municipal drinking water.
[3:30:16.180 --> 3:30:20.300]  Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive, immune, and developmental
[3:30:20.300 --> 3:30:21.300]  system diseases.
[3:30:21.300 --> 3:30:23.500]  Now, what are you going to do about it?
[3:30:23.500 --> 3:30:28.260]  The Acola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator is a low-cost way to take back control of
[3:30:28.260 --> 3:30:30.020]  you and your family's drinking water.
[3:30:30.020 --> 3:30:34.740]  The Acola Blue 28 produces up to seven gallons of water from the humidity in the atmosphere
[3:30:34.740 --> 3:30:40.140]  and uses state-of-the-art carbon filtration, reverse osmosis, and ultra-violent light sterilization
[3:30:40.140 --> 3:30:41.140]  techniques.
[3:30:41.140 --> 3:30:44.500]  That's right, clean water right from the air you breathe.
[3:30:44.500 --> 3:30:53.260]  Remember today, by calling 1-800-691-6043, that's 1-800-691-6043, or visit Acola Blue
[3:30:53.260 --> 3:31:01.620]  on the web at www.ecoloblu.com today, that's acolablue.com.
[3:31:01.620 --> 3:31:03.620]  Her beloved republic is on her knees.
[3:31:03.620 --> 3:31:08.140]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide, but in liberty's darkest
[3:31:08.140 --> 3:31:09.700]  hour there is hope.
[3:31:09.700 --> 3:31:12.780]  The first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[3:31:12.780 --> 3:31:17.020]  It is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New
[3:31:17.020 --> 3:31:18.540]  World Order master plan.
[3:31:18.540 --> 3:31:22.820]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.
[3:31:22.820 --> 3:31:28.020]  In the Info War, PrisonPlanet.tv is a powerful weapon in the battle to regain our freedom.
[3:31:28.020 --> 3:31:31.060]  PrisonPlanet.tv is a fault of forbidden information.
[3:31:31.060 --> 3:31:35.700]  All 18 of my documentary films can be downloaded or streamed in super-high quality directly
[3:31:35.700 --> 3:31:38.340]  to your computer or iPhone and shared with others.

[3:31:42.940 --> 3:31:47.980]  online video library, by weekly news television broadcast, thousands of exclusive audio interviews
[3:31:47.980 --> 3:31:48.980]  and so much more.
[3:31:48.980 --> 3:31:52.060]  The Info War is waiting for you to set it free.

[3:32:02.500 --> 3:32:07.540]  Hi it's MZ wondering how many of us Alex Jones fans intend to take the swine flu vaccine.
[3:32:07.540 --> 3:32:11.220]  I'm not, don't trust it, but then I don't want to get the disease either.
[3:32:11.220 --> 3:32:17.220]  So I use PureWorks, a unique disinfectant that comes in foam or spray form.
[3:32:17.220 --> 3:32:19.500]  PureWorks is not your typical hand disinfectant.
[3:32:19.500 --> 3:32:24.020]  There is no alcohol to dry your skin and it lasts for hours, not minutes.
[3:32:24.020 --> 3:32:27.180]  Use PureWorks to protect yourself from disease and infection.
[3:32:27.180 --> 3:32:35.380]  You can find out all about it and order it online at nogerms.info, that's nogerms.info.
[3:32:35.380 --> 3:32:40.420]  Don't introduce potentially dangerous chemicals or toxins into your body to keep you well,
[3:32:40.420 --> 3:32:43.980]  when they could actually cause the sickness you want to avoid.
[3:32:43.980 --> 3:32:49.740]  Don't pick your nose, don't shake hands and don't handle banisters, rails and doorknobs.
[3:32:49.740 --> 3:32:54.860]  Do try PureWorks, available online at wholesale pricing to Alex Jones listeners.
[3:32:54.860 --> 3:32:58.780]  Go to nogerms.info, that's nogerms.info.
[3:32:58.780 --> 3:33:11.260]  Be well and stay well, best in the-
[3:33:11.260 --> 3:33:16.180]  Head Anderson is our guest, we're going to go to your phone calls, Anthony Kurtz, Scott
[3:33:16.180 --> 3:33:20.020]  Shelley Laura and others here in just a moment.
[3:33:20.020 --> 3:33:25.620]  Also this morning, I've always meant to bring in some of my pen and ink work, some of the
[3:33:25.620 --> 3:33:30.180]  acrylics I've done, some of the oil paintings I've painted, because really, that's what
[3:33:30.180 --> 3:33:31.180]  I'm into.
[3:33:31.180 --> 3:33:38.540]  I mean, I'm into deep-sea fishing, deep-sea diving, I'm into camping, people always ask
[3:33:38.540 --> 3:33:43.860]  what I do, what I like, and when I talk about it's a weight to have to come in here and
[3:33:43.860 --> 3:33:47.540]  fight the New World Order, I've got other things I want to do.
[3:33:47.540 --> 3:33:55.580]  I mean, I would just rather sit out at a farmhouse somewhere and oil paint and hike and
[3:33:55.580 --> 3:34:05.780]  grow gardens and hang out with my children and, quite frankly, write poetry, things
[3:34:05.780 --> 3:34:06.780]  like that.
[3:34:06.780 --> 3:34:10.260]  I mean, I don't like having to fight the New World Order all day, I don't like having
[3:34:10.260 --> 3:34:15.380]  to come in here and, you know, I don't relish this, this is about survival, this is about
[3:34:15.380 --> 3:34:21.740]  standing up for human liberty so that we can all lead our lives the way we see fit.
[3:34:21.740 --> 3:34:27.340]  But I've painted a lot until I hit about 25 and I was so busy by then with the radio
[3:34:27.340 --> 3:34:33.780]  and TV shows that I've been doing for three, four years by then that I quit painting, except
[3:34:33.780 --> 3:34:39.140]  for oil painting every once in a while, a little bit of watercolor.
[3:34:39.140 --> 3:34:48.540]  But here's one I did, I was looking online at Japanese pen and inks, this is like a
[3:34:48.540 --> 3:34:53.820]  400-year-old one, it's my own painting, I mean, it's a lot different than that one,
[3:34:53.820 --> 3:34:58.300]  it's not even really, it's kind of after that piece, I forget the name of the piece.
[3:34:58.300 --> 3:35:01.260]  This morning I thought, why not bring a few of my smaller paintings?
[3:35:01.260 --> 3:35:08.780]  This is my own style here, I can certainly paint with a palette, with a thin oil and
[3:35:08.780 --> 3:35:17.940]  a veneer and do even more, let me have a shot from over there, do even more detailed work.
[3:35:17.940 --> 3:35:26.380]  But this is really the style that I developed, it's a thick paint, almost three-dimensional,
[3:35:26.380 --> 3:35:29.500]  well not almost, it is three-dimensional.
[3:35:29.500 --> 3:35:37.380]  And so that's a rough seas with a squall stormy skies and I really liked this little
[3:35:37.380 --> 3:35:38.700]  painting I did.
[3:35:38.700 --> 3:35:42.380]  And then here's another one, I took this photo and I quit painting, right around the time
[3:35:42.380 --> 3:35:47.180]  I quit painting when I was about 24, 25, of some sunflowers, my parents live on three
[3:35:47.180 --> 3:35:51.980]  and a half acres in town, they had a big sunflower grove and I cut a bunch of sunflowers and some
[3:35:51.980 --> 3:35:56.780]  other wildflowers and stuck them in a green vase and took a photo on my parents' table
[3:35:56.780 --> 3:35:57.780]  and meant to paint it.
[3:35:57.780 --> 3:36:00.740]  And that's why I started painting again about a year ago, I was digging through stuff and
[3:36:00.740 --> 3:36:11.900]  found this old photo, so this was the first painting I did after, you can call it whatever
[3:36:11.900 --> 3:36:19.420]  style you want, but there are the well paintings of Alex Jones, I'll give you a better shot
[3:36:19.420 --> 3:36:22.060]  over there so you can really look at it.
[3:36:22.060 --> 3:36:27.900]  But I wanted to show people that little glimpse into my mind, what I'm into for people that
[3:36:27.900 --> 3:36:35.260]  are interested, because I'd rather be admiring mountain vistas, I'd rather be rock hunting,
[3:36:35.260 --> 3:36:42.180]  I'm a rock hound, my son and my older daughter are both rock pups as they call them, I mean
[3:36:42.180 --> 3:36:48.740]  I want to go exploring, I want to do things, I mean it's not some macho thing to go face
[3:36:48.740 --> 3:36:53.740]  down stormtrooper police or mercenaries or sneak into Bohemian Grove, I'm really sick
[3:36:53.740 --> 3:36:54.740]  of it all.
[3:36:54.740 --> 3:37:00.140]  I'm not complaining either, I'm just saying that there's a lot more to me than, I try
[3:37:00.140 --> 3:37:03.860]  to get up here and be calm on the air, I'm mad about this stuff and I always paint a little
[3:37:03.860 --> 3:37:13.220]  painting on the back, just some mindless doodle quickly, there's one there, there's a painting
[3:37:13.220 --> 3:37:21.780]  on the back of here, sign the back all insanely, but I am going to try to do more of this,
[3:37:21.780 --> 3:37:29.060]  okay I just wanted to bring that up here, two smaller paintings I did, going back to
[3:37:29.060 --> 3:37:34.380]  Anderson 10, again you said that you're about to run out of the gold and silver, you bought
[3:37:34.380 --> 3:37:40.820]  at the 990 level in the market, explain to people those coins, you say you're going to
[3:37:40.820 --> 3:37:51.380]  hold it till midnight now, even if you lose money, that's your rodeo 800-686-237, 800-686-237,
[3:37:51.380 --> 3:37:54.100]  tell folks about the coins you've got at that price right now.
[3:37:54.100 --> 3:37:58.660]  Yeah sure, I mean the Frank right now is at 233, for those of you who are listening when
[3:37:58.660 --> 3:38:03.940]  gold was at 945 I was offering them at 236, so they're actually lower than they were back
[3:38:03.940 --> 3:38:10.300]  at that time, the British sovereign currently at 288, they were 291, the walking liberty
[3:38:10.300 --> 3:38:15.660]  halves I've been holding that price at 869 for a long time just because I was able to
[3:38:15.660 --> 3:38:21.180]  buy a real big position, all I can say is that people are finally waking up, we're getting
[3:38:21.180 --> 3:38:26.220]  a lot of phone calls, people are buying a lot of gold and I don't want to stop that,
[3:38:26.220 --> 3:38:29.860]  I mean people need to have gold right now, it's like one of the few things that they
[3:38:29.860 --> 3:38:35.980]  can put their hands on into their possession and actually expect the fact that it'll hold
[3:38:35.980 --> 3:38:42.020]  value for years to come and the dollar isn't going to do that for you anymore, unfortunately
[3:38:42.020 --> 3:38:46.340]  it's sad, you know, Alex there's a soft side of you, I didn't know, I didn't know you
[3:38:46.340 --> 3:38:50.540]  painted, I think that's just great, I know I don't get it, I told guys around the office
[3:38:50.540 --> 3:38:56.740]  I brought some paintings and I got the sissy comment, there's nothing sissy about having
[3:38:56.740 --> 3:39:01.740]  images in your mind of beauty, it's like I admire a beautiful woman, I mean I tried
[3:39:01.740 --> 3:39:08.660]  to catch that photo of a dark house in the middle of the day, my parents living room
[3:39:08.660 --> 3:39:15.940]  table, it's kind of a dark room when the shades aren't up and it was on a wooden table and
[3:39:15.940 --> 3:39:21.700]  the camera had a flash on it so it illuminated and that's, you know, that's kind of my surreal
[3:39:21.700 --> 3:39:29.140]  or impressionistic, this is more impressionistic representation, it's impressionist more than
[3:39:29.140 --> 3:39:36.820]  anything but it's a little bit of surreal at the same time of that, you know, 11, 12
[3:39:36.820 --> 3:39:42.340]  years ago and so I think it's interesting, I think and of course the studies show it's
[3:39:42.340 --> 3:39:47.580]  good for your brain too but yeah Ted, you've been in my house, those oil paintings you
[3:39:47.580 --> 3:39:49.140]  see on the walls, I painted most of them.
[3:39:49.140 --> 3:39:52.700]  I didn't realize that, I didn't know they were your work, I mean those were just awesome,
[3:39:52.700 --> 3:39:56.340]  I mean every now and then you find something out about somebody and you just go oh my
[3:39:56.340 --> 3:40:01.460]  god, I didn't realize that and here I've been to your house, we had a really great time
[3:40:01.460 --> 3:40:05.380]  at that Willie Nelson concert out in the, it was the concert in the, what do they call
[3:40:05.380 --> 3:40:10.420]  it, the park or whatever they did and to meet your family and you know, just no more, I
[3:40:10.420 --> 3:40:14.620]  mean it's, you know, sometimes you have a picture in your mind and yeah, I think that's
[3:40:14.620 --> 3:40:15.620]  just great.
[3:40:15.620 --> 3:40:21.460]  Anyways, getting back to the gold, Alex, all I can say is that I know, unless a gold
[3:40:21.460 --> 3:40:26.780]  drops down in the $900 level again and I don't think it's gonna, I'm not gonna be able to
[3:40:26.780 --> 3:40:32.220]  come up with these prices anymore, the prices are gonna go up, I can't hold, I'm not a miracle
[3:40:32.220 --> 3:40:38.100]  worker here but I will take any deal up to midnight at these prices and I would suggest
[3:40:38.100 --> 3:40:41.420]  that you get a move on it if you're thinking about it at all because this is the time to
[3:40:41.420 --> 3:40:42.420]  be doing it.
[3:40:42.420 --> 3:40:47.300]  I mean, they're just, when you see the United Nations in these major countries, I mean these
[3:40:47.300 --> 3:40:52.860]  are the countries that finance the United States, we quite literally had the prosperity
[3:40:52.860 --> 3:40:59.980]  we had here in the United States between the year 1980 and the year 2006 about because of
[3:40:59.980 --> 3:41:04.780]  the fact that they were able to lend us their prosperity and we didn't have to suffer the
[3:41:04.780 --> 3:41:11.620]  consequences of inflating a currency but now we're sitting here with even a much greater
[3:41:11.620 --> 3:41:18.980]  need for money to be lent to us, a much larger volume of a more ferocious appetite for debt
[3:41:18.980 --> 3:41:22.460]  because we're solving all of our problems, we're not gonna go into a healthcare thing,
[3:41:22.460 --> 3:41:28.820]  I mean the carbon taxes, I mean this whole thing is just getting way out of hand and
[3:41:28.820 --> 3:41:32.700]  the foreigners are saying, oh sorry, we're no longer gonna be accredited, we're cutting
[3:41:32.700 --> 3:41:38.700]  off and that leaves the United States government to sell its US government securities to the
[3:41:38.700 --> 3:41:40.340]  Federal Reserve System.
[3:41:40.340 --> 3:41:44.900]  It's called the open market operation in case you don't know that and all it means is that
[3:41:44.900 --> 3:41:48.820]  they're turning on the printing press and they're solving all their financial troubles
[3:41:48.820 --> 3:41:55.620]  with that and you know, I'm not kidding yet when I say Argentina, Brazil, Mexico, I mean
[3:41:55.620 --> 3:41:58.780]  you think that all third world nations, they can't be the same, well guess what, the only
[3:41:58.780 --> 3:42:03.180]  difference between them and the United States is that the United States had some credibility
[3:42:03.180 --> 3:42:09.540]  for years that was carried on from a gold standard in 1971 and earlier and now we're
[3:42:09.540 --> 3:42:14.700]  at the end of the rope, this is it, the game is over, people are realizing it, my phones
[3:42:14.700 --> 3:42:19.340]  are ringing thank God, people are getting out of paper, they're going into gold, I just
[3:42:19.340 --> 3:42:24.780]  can't think of a better thing to do for people than that and I just need to say it Alex,
[3:42:24.780 --> 3:42:26.220]  people need to do it.
[3:42:26.220 --> 3:42:30.020]  It isn't a question of as to whether or not I think I should buy some gold and silver
[3:42:30.020 --> 3:42:35.020]  and how much and yadda yadda yadda, hey, keep as much as you want in paper currency, just
[3:42:35.020 --> 3:42:38.220]  expect the fact that you're going to buy an awful lot less with that in a very short
[3:42:38.220 --> 3:42:43.780]  period of time, I don't mean to predict the future but that's just where we're going.
[3:42:43.780 --> 3:42:50.340]  Absolutely, 800-686-2237 and again, your purchase also makes this radio show possible, can't
[3:42:50.340 --> 3:42:54.300]  beat these deals, it goes to midnight tonight, sinful standard time, thank you so much, Dan
[3:42:54.300 --> 3:42:55.300]  Anderson.
[3:42:55.300 --> 3:42:57.140]  Yeah, thanks for having me up Alex.
[3:42:57.140 --> 3:42:59.140]  You bet, good to have you here with us.
[3:42:59.140 --> 3:43:03.300]  All right, I said I was going to take some calls, I'm really upset about what's happening
[3:43:03.300 --> 3:43:07.220]  with the dollar, I'm upset about the flu, that it's live, flu virus they're putting
[3:43:07.220 --> 3:43:12.060]  in the nasal spray and they admit it's spreading it, how dumb do they think we are, they spread
[3:43:12.060 --> 3:43:16.020]  it in front of everyone as the cure and then it'll be a big pandemic, I mean these people
[3:43:16.020 --> 3:43:24.100]  are, they're bold, con artists are bold.
[3:43:24.100 --> 3:43:28.860]  These aren't just con artists, these are eugenicists, control freaks that want to ruin our lives,
[3:43:28.860 --> 3:43:34.900]  they're predators and at a very base level, I get threatened by people that attack me,
[3:43:34.900 --> 3:43:40.580]  people that attack me mentally, financially, liberty wise, governmental, I mean I can't
[3:43:40.580 --> 3:43:47.020]  help it, somebody messes with me, I immediately start disliking them, I immediately start
[3:43:47.020 --> 3:43:51.380]  thinking about them, I immediately start thinking about ways to get my hands around their throat
[3:43:51.380 --> 3:43:58.140]  and I try to not be like that but I mean, I'm sick of your crap government and all the corrupt
[3:43:58.140 --> 3:44:06.500]  scum that surrounds you, I've been trying to be calm all day, I am pissed, I just can't
[3:44:06.500 --> 3:44:11.700]  handle it anymore man, I'm sick of it, I want government off my back, I want all the corrupt
[3:44:11.700 --> 3:44:16.300]  scum that's lazy and stupid so you go join government to suck off of us, to get out of
[3:44:16.300 --> 3:44:22.940]  my life, I don't belong to you and I'm sick of ill-informed morons trying to tell me how
[3:44:22.940 --> 3:44:31.900]  things work or tell me what's going on and how Obama's good or Bush is good or some jackass
[3:44:31.900 --> 3:44:36.660]  democratic operative trying to mess with me right now that I'm going to have to stomp
[3:44:36.660 --> 3:44:41.460]  flat or to pancake legally, I mean I just get sick of all the crud that goes on around
[3:44:41.460 --> 3:44:46.940]  here behind the scenes and all the stupid scum that don't understand that I'm on their
[3:44:46.940 --> 3:44:51.340]  team, that I want them to do well, that I know they're under eugenics, that they just
[3:44:51.340 --> 3:44:56.500]  bind to the fake paradigm and they run with it and they have no connection to reality.
[3:44:56.500 --> 3:45:01.580]  All you stupid Obama supporters, all you stupid Bush supporters, they're all owned by the
[3:45:01.580 --> 3:45:05.660]  same people and I know our audience knows that but I'm talking to the new idiots tuning
[3:45:05.660 --> 3:45:13.020]  in, listen, it's fundamental, what is so hard to explain to you, it's fundamental they're
[3:45:13.020 --> 3:45:18.220]  killing the dollar, printing tens of trillions of it, it's fundamental it's going to plunge
[3:45:18.220 --> 3:45:25.460]  in value, it's fundamental gold's going to go up, it's fundamental, it isn't hard to
[3:45:25.460 --> 3:45:35.340]  figure out, who's up next here, Anthony in New York, you're on the air, go ahead Anthony
[3:45:35.340 --> 3:45:36.340]  Alex
[3:45:36.340 --> 3:45:37.340]  Hey buddy
[3:45:37.340 --> 3:45:38.340]  How you doing?
[3:45:38.340 --> 3:45:39.340]  I'm not doing too good
[3:45:39.340 --> 3:45:41.340]  God bless you for the job you do
[3:45:41.340 --> 3:45:47.940]  Well I mean then why, I've got to fight these people, I mean I would be a moron, I would
[3:45:47.940 --> 3:45:51.460]  not have the instinct of self preservation if I didn't fight these people
[3:45:51.460 --> 3:45:55.580]  Well of course, but God bless you anyway and I'm a stockbroker from New York and I couldn't
[3:45:55.580 --> 3:46:00.540]  agree with you and Ted Moore about gold and Peter Schiff inspired, I couldn't agree with
[3:46:00.540 --> 3:46:05.300]  him more about the foreign stocks and if you look at the way the Swiss Frank behaved during
[3:46:05.300 --> 3:46:10.900]  some of the bulk of the crisis with us last March, it shot up because they have commodity
[3:46:10.900 --> 3:46:11.900]  based currency
[3:46:11.900 --> 3:46:12.900]  Yeah
[3:46:12.900 --> 3:46:17.260]  And I was at one of these town hall meetings last night with Steve Israel and let me just
[3:46:17.260 --> 3:46:21.420]  tell you this thing was totally rigged and I was able to break through the rigging, I
[3:46:21.420 --> 3:46:26.060]  was standing right in front of them and they had my question come through but the League
[3:46:26.060 --> 3:46:29.780]  of Women Voters had to ask the questions for us, they wouldn't let it in
[3:46:29.780 --> 3:46:31.660]  They're total operatives, you know
[3:46:31.660 --> 3:46:35.740]  But they call your name and you stand up and then they ask the question for you, so I stood
[3:46:35.740 --> 3:46:41.020]  up and he has his cronies with him, he has his lawyer and a doctor and some other crony
[3:46:41.020 --> 3:46:43.500]  answering half the questions for him
[3:46:43.500 --> 3:46:48.340]  So the lawyer goes to answer my question and I stood up and I shouted right in his face
[3:46:48.340 --> 3:46:51.020]  and I said I want you to answer
[3:46:51.020 --> 3:46:55.460]  And some people in the crowd told me to sit down and I said no, I want him to answer and
[3:46:55.460 --> 3:47:04.100]  the local paper Newsday took my picture, I'm in the paper, I'm on the Newsday.com website
[3:47:04.100 --> 3:47:06.180]  And I want to run up against this guy as an independent
[3:47:06.180 --> 3:47:10.980]  And of course he's pushing the government takeover of healthcare
[3:47:10.980 --> 3:47:16.580]  Yes, yes, and I want to run against him as an independent, I think I could do it and
[3:47:16.580 --> 3:47:20.260]  I think we need guys like me and Peter Schiff in there that understand if we don't get our
[3:47:20.260 --> 3:47:25.860]  financial house in order, all the rest of the debate and all the rest of the issues,
[3:47:25.860 --> 3:47:31.060]  you know, there's nothing left if there's no currency
[3:47:31.060 --> 3:47:36.300]  And we all know that saying, you know, control a nation's currency and I care not who makes
[3:47:36.300 --> 3:47:38.380]  us loss
[3:47:38.380 --> 3:47:43.060]  Good points my friend, I appreciate you calling Anthony from New York, good to hear from you
[3:47:43.060 --> 3:47:45.420]  Kurt in Texas, you're on the air
[3:47:45.420 --> 3:47:54.740]  Hi, yes sir, I've heard you talk sometime about the tracking cars to tax them for the
[3:47:54.740 --> 3:47:56.900]  miles that they drive
[3:47:56.900 --> 3:47:57.900]  Yes
[3:47:57.900 --> 3:48:06.300]  About two weeks ago I tried to apply for insurance with a certain company here and after we talked
[3:48:06.300 --> 3:48:14.180]  about the policy on the car, the fellow said, we have a new program, said do you drive your
[3:48:14.180 --> 3:48:20.860]  car very much and I said, no, I don't just back to the store and back, I'm retired
[3:48:20.860 --> 3:48:28.740]  And he said, well, we have a new program if we can put this little device in the car that
[3:48:28.740 --> 3:48:36.740]  will tell us where you're going and how many miles you traveled during the day, we can
[3:48:36.740 --> 3:48:38.660]  offer you a 10% discount
[3:48:38.660 --> 3:48:40.660]  Yeah, is it progressive?
[3:48:40.660 --> 3:48:42.660]  Yes, it is
[3:48:42.660 --> 3:48:47.980]  Yeah, see, they lied to you, they're getting money, thousands of dollars and depending
[3:48:47.980 --> 3:48:54.180]  on the federal study to put a satellite by the mile tracker in your car to test it, Texas
[3:48:54.180 --> 3:49:00.020]  is the main testing ground, do you happen to be in Austin or surrounding areas?
[3:49:00.020 --> 3:49:03.140]  No, West Texas, Abilene
[3:49:03.140 --> 3:49:06.500]  But you didn't mention progressive to me, right?
[3:49:06.500 --> 3:49:07.500]  You did
[3:49:07.500 --> 3:49:13.860]  Yeah, I wanted to make sure because I'm, yeah, no, no, progressive is the one doing that,
[3:49:13.860 --> 3:49:17.660]  some others are doing it and they admit in the federal program, they're getting ready
[3:49:17.660 --> 3:49:24.220]  to tax us by the mile that you can Google, Austin, test by the mile tax, and they're
[3:49:24.220 --> 3:49:28.860]  going to keep the oil tax too, oil tax revenues are at all time highs but they lie and say
[3:49:28.860 --> 3:49:38.300]  they're not, they're going to, and but progressive already jacks in to what all new cars have
[3:49:38.300 --> 3:49:42.500]  had for at least a decade, they already have an onboard computer that tracks how fast you're
[3:49:42.500 --> 3:49:47.100]  driving, what happens, the cops use it to set you up, you know, if you roll your car
[3:49:47.100 --> 3:49:50.260]  now and aren't even drinking, they'll go ahead and take your kids and put you in prisons,
[3:49:50.260 --> 3:49:54.140]  you know, because they got to fill these prisons and so progressive is a very, very wicked
[3:49:54.140 --> 3:50:00.020]  company and a very, very new world order just like Microsoft and IBM.
[3:50:00.020 --> 3:50:04.620]  And so I would just get away from progressive, they're trying to make the whole industry
[3:50:04.620 --> 3:50:11.140]  shift where you've got to have government healthcare, $5,000, $3,000 to $5,000 your fines,
[3:50:11.140 --> 3:50:14.580]  you're going to have to have expanded auto coverage, you're going to have to have other
[3:50:14.580 --> 3:50:19.340]  coverage and then this is the nanny state where, oh, well, if you accept a chip or a
[3:50:19.340 --> 3:50:24.140]  tracker bracelet, oh, then, oh, if you accept us, you know, you get a discount.
[3:50:24.140 --> 3:50:28.620]  So they make the economy so bad that you have to accept all this.
[3:50:28.620 --> 3:50:31.060]  So they socially control you through the insurance.
[3:50:31.060 --> 3:50:34.820]  But yeah, no, progressive is just a real dirt bag group.
[3:50:34.820 --> 3:50:43.100]  No, if it was truly true or not, but a friend of mine said that the Dallas fair this year,
[3:50:43.100 --> 3:50:47.860]  they were putting a bracelet on the children when they came in.
[3:50:47.860 --> 3:50:54.740]  Yeah, they do that at Disney World, face scan, hand scan, same thing at the sea world, all
[3:50:54.740 --> 3:51:01.940]  slave grid training admitted, the casual society control grid, entire country, one giant prison.
[3:51:01.940 --> 3:51:03.860]  We all need to prepare ourselves.
[3:51:03.860 --> 3:51:09.100]  You might have the food, water, gold and silver, but ask yourself, are you truly prepared?

[3:52:01.500 --> 3:52:07.580]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[3:52:07.580 --> 3:52:12.100]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of
[3:52:12.100 --> 3:52:13.420]  us would like to see.
[3:52:13.420 --> 3:52:18.580]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest
[3:52:18.580 --> 3:52:19.580]  of the American people.
[3:52:19.580 --> 3:52:24.340]  While Obama's already fudging, he's fudged since day one in this election.
[3:52:24.340 --> 3:52:29.460]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement, a personality cultist, who is imposing
[3:52:29.460 --> 3:52:37.580]  the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[3:52:37.580 --> 3:52:39.260]  It's not about left to right.
[3:52:39.260 --> 3:52:41.140]  It's about a one-world government.
[3:52:41.140 --> 3:52:48.060]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[3:54:49.140 --> 3:54:53.620]  pure, goes through seven filters including reverse osmosis and carbon, and is held in

[3:55:38.140 --> 3:55:42.700]  it before you kick it in the head, or if you work in dangerous areas, whatever, the point

[3:55:52.020 --> 3:55:54.420]  the UK, then Shelly and Laura, go ahead Scott.
[3:55:54.420 --> 3:56:01.500]  Hello Alex, well done, you're doing good.
[3:56:01.500 --> 3:56:09.580]  Just calling up about the whole gold and dollar issue that's to seem to appear today, it's
[3:56:09.580 --> 3:56:19.180]  really made me wonder why is gold now such a thing to aim for, why has the American dollar
[3:56:19.180 --> 3:56:25.340]  just been made to plummet, it just doesn't make any sense, and one thing with the American
[3:56:25.340 --> 3:56:32.380]  dollar being the world currency, does it actually matter what currency we're using as a world
[3:56:32.380 --> 3:56:39.620]  currency, isn't the actual concept of using a currency corrupting itself?
[3:56:39.620 --> 3:56:44.380]  Well that's a huge question and huge issue, and I don't claim to have all the answers,
[3:56:44.380 --> 3:56:49.420]  but gold is an intrinsic industrial metal used in thousands and thousands of different
[3:56:49.420 --> 3:56:57.580]  industries, gold is the oldest form of money, it's finite, it's truly precious, it's scarce,
[3:56:57.580 --> 3:57:01.820]  diamonds are artificially scarce, that's done by the De Beers and Oppenheimer's and
[3:57:01.820 --> 3:57:06.540]  as a fraud, but gold and silver, there's only so much of it, just like there's only so
[3:57:06.540 --> 3:57:15.460]  much uranium or plutonium, or any of these metals, or any of these, sorry?
[3:57:15.460 --> 3:57:20.900]  You can always get gold back, can't you, in its form, as gold, wherever it's being used.
[3:57:20.900 --> 3:57:24.140]  I'm going to let you go because we're almost out of time, thank you for the call, you can
[3:57:24.140 --> 3:57:27.660]  call me back tomorrow if you wish to discuss this more.
[3:57:27.660 --> 3:57:32.740]  The human population is 6.5 billion and growing, and so the gold is in a lot of things, but
[3:57:32.740 --> 3:57:37.540]  people don't strip the gold out of a microchip generally when it goes to the landfill.
[3:57:37.540 --> 3:57:44.220]  So hell, I mean if people want stocks and bonds, or people want paper money over gold,
[3:57:44.220 --> 3:57:51.860]  get into it, it's just oil and other commodities like gold and timber and real estate, things
[3:57:51.860 --> 3:57:59.220]  that have some intrinsic value, they are going to have more value during inflation and during
[3:57:59.220 --> 3:58:01.700]  currency devaluations.
[3:58:01.700 --> 3:58:08.580]  So gold is up because the bankers have issued tens of trillions of U.S. currency to the world,
[3:58:08.580 --> 3:58:13.420]  and it's just backed up by nothing, and so people rightfully are suspicious of it.
[3:58:13.420 --> 3:58:20.540]  I'm sorry to Shelley and Laura, call me back tomorrow to go to the head of the line, but
[3:58:20.540 --> 3:58:25.860]  gold is up, not because gold is up, but because the dollar is being devalued by over printing
[3:58:25.860 --> 3:58:31.980]  and over issuance, and what matters about a global currency is who controls the currency,
[3:58:31.980 --> 3:58:33.780]  because they can use it to destroy your nation.
[3:58:33.780 --> 3:58:39.300]  Read what Thomas Jefferson had to say, or Benjamin Franklin, great job crew, retransmission
