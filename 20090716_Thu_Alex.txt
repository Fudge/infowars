[00:00:04.813 --> 00:00:09.635]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:09.635 --> 00:00:11.216]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.216 --> 00:00:12.777]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.777 --> 00:00:16.958]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:16.958 --> 00:00:21.040]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:31.496 --> 00:00:35.678]  Welcome ladies and gentlemen, welcome and thank you so much for joining us.
[00:00:35.678 --> 00:00:39.159]  It is Thursday, the 16th day of July 2009.
[00:00:39.159 --> 00:00:46.222]  We're going to be here live for the next four hours.
[00:00:46.222 --> 00:00:49.083]  We have Wayne Paul.
[00:00:49.083 --> 00:00:54.926]  Wayne Paul, brother of Congressman Ron Paul, uncle of Rand Paul.
[00:00:56.147 --> 00:01:10.099]  Joining us coming up two hours from now, and then we have Dr. Rima Lebo, Medical Doctor, and Albert N. Stubblebind III, Major General.
[00:01:10.099 --> 00:01:11.780]  And boy, we have a lot to talk about there.
[00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:14.623]  Codex Alimentarius, you name it.
[00:01:14.623 --> 00:01:16.545]  Oh, and before I forget, guys, I had it in here last week.
[00:01:17.386 --> 00:01:29.749]  Print me that latest Wired Magazine article where the Pentagon admits they're going system-wide with psychic soldiers and all that stuff, because it was General Stubblebine that was first over all those programs.
[00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:32.110]  The real X-Files.
[00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:39.472]  So now that a lot of us declassified, he can probably talk a bit more about it, though that's not the main reason I have him coming on the show today.
[00:01:39.472 --> 00:01:43.673]  Former head of Army Intelligence, former head of Special Forces, and another
[00:01:45.051 --> 00:01:47.514]  I don't think I've ever heard Wayne pull on radio.
[00:01:47.514 --> 00:01:51.417]  I ran into him at a In The Fed demonstration.
[00:01:59.415 --> 00:02:00.636]  I don't know.
[00:02:21.815 --> 00:02:26.158]  Know that they were military spying on us, that we might turn into terrorists and go after them.
[00:02:26.158 --> 00:02:28.359]  You can read the Army Memo.
[00:02:28.359 --> 00:02:34.123]  We were sent this by the Army, by inside sources, I guess by our infiltrators.
[00:02:34.123 --> 00:02:47.652]  Infiltrators for the Republic, infiltrators for liberty in the Bill of Rights and Constitution, infiltrators that know it's illegal to have the military spying on peaceful Americans that don't want an offshore private criminal bank gang raping us.
[00:02:50.077 --> 00:03:05.443]  And then after we broke that secret Army document, months later, the Baltimore Sun and other publications reported that in Maryland, regular Army was spying on the last Tea Parties.
[00:03:05.443 --> 00:03:15.788]  Oh, that's right, you dare come out and say you don't want higher taxes, you don't want open borders, you don't want to live under a foreign IMF World Bank control of the World Trade Organization.
[00:03:16.923 --> 00:03:19.404]  You got the army on your six.
[00:03:19.404 --> 00:03:42.117]  The good news is this is waking the army up because 74% of the money given to political candidates early in the primaries until Ron Paul dropped off and dropped out of the military was given to Ron Paul.
[00:03:42.117 --> 00:03:43.918]  What does that say to the New World Order?
[00:03:46.188 --> 00:03:57.213]  That's why in 2008, what was Bilderberg discussing from our inside sources, according to Estalin and Tucker?
[00:03:57.213 --> 00:03:59.774]  They were talking about Ron Paul.
[00:03:59.774 --> 00:04:03.756]  And they weren't worried about him winning, they knew they could block him out and rig that.
[00:04:04.758 --> 00:04:06.658]  And demonize him and ignore him.
[00:04:06.658 --> 00:04:09.199]  They were worried about the citizen movement around it.
[00:04:09.199 --> 00:04:11.839]  They were worried about the universities.
[00:04:11.839 --> 00:04:33.984]  They were worried about how it was no longer the fake right-wing paradigm or the fake left-wing socialist paradigm that the youth were into, but ending the Fed, getting back to the Republic, getting back to the Constitution, getting back to the Bill of Rights, getting back to what made America great, what made Americana be able to exist, what came before baseball and apple pie.
[00:04:36.004 --> 00:04:38.066]  Why we love the flag.
[00:04:38.066 --> 00:04:44.893]  What it really symbolizes, the blood, the sweat, the tears, the guts that were spilt out on battlefields.
[00:04:44.893 --> 00:04:47.556]  The spirit of 1776.
[00:04:47.556 --> 00:04:48.797]  Rising.
[00:04:48.797 --> 00:04:50.919]  Growing.
[00:04:50.919 --> 00:04:52.160]  Forming.
[00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:55.784]  First as a vapor, then the bones and the muscles.
[00:04:55.784 --> 00:04:57.245]  Now the flesh.
[00:04:57.245 --> 00:04:58.286]  Rising.
[00:04:58.286 --> 00:04:59.107]  Rising.
[00:04:59.107 --> 00:04:59.668]  Alive again.

[00:06:00.762 --> 00:06:02.423]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[00:06:02.423 --> 00:06:07.164]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[00:06:07.164 --> 00:06:10.146]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[00:06:10.146 --> 00:06:13.187]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[00:06:13.187 --> 00:06:19.029]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency if you simply prepare.
[00:06:19.269 --> 00:06:22.494]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[00:06:22.494 --> 00:06:29.504]  You know eFoodsDirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.
[00:06:29.504 --> 00:06:32.789]  And they do it at almost half the cost of last year's grocery prices.

[00:07:29.369 --> 00:07:30.990]  Wondering about your retirement portfolio?

[00:07:50.963 --> 00:07:51.003]  877-479-8178.
[00:08:00.790 --> 00:08:16.820]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:16.820 --> 00:08:20.082]  We are living in the future.
[00:08:20.082 --> 00:08:20.342]  It is 2009.
[00:08:20.342 --> 00:08:21.823]  It will soon be 2010.
[00:08:21.823 --> 00:08:22.764]  There are giant
[00:08:29.605 --> 00:08:49.759]  Highly secretive government and private industrial reservations all over the world with technological systems and developments at least 30 to 35 years more advanced than what the public is aware of.
[00:08:49.759 --> 00:08:55.943]  Now do you understand what that means?
[00:08:55.943 --> 00:08:57.184]  Do you know what that means?
[00:08:58.234 --> 00:09:15.258]  If technology is doubling every two years, at the technological plane of existence we're on here, that the general public lives in, at this arrested development stage that they have us almost frozen at.
[00:09:15.258 --> 00:09:20.539]  If technology is doubling, we'll do the exponential math with a calculator.
[00:09:22.267 --> 00:09:22.967]  Guys do that.
[00:09:22.967 --> 00:09:25.149]  What's an exponential curve?
[00:09:25.149 --> 00:09:30.572]  Let's just say 30 years, doubling each time exponentially?
[00:09:30.572 --> 00:09:31.473]  How do you do that equation?
[00:09:31.473 --> 00:09:32.193]  I just thought to do it.
[00:09:32.193 --> 00:09:41.819]  I can't chew gum and kick butt at the same time or chew gum and I guess talk at the same time.
[00:09:41.819 --> 00:09:42.880]  Jaren, do the math on that.
[00:09:42.880 --> 00:09:47.302]  How would you do that equation?
[00:09:47.302 --> 00:09:49.404]  300th power?
[00:09:49.404 --> 00:09:51.085]  Yeah, what is an exponential?
[00:09:52.315 --> 00:10:00.919]  Take the number 10, because you've got to have some number to use.
[00:10:00.919 --> 00:10:08.202]  Or take the number 1, saying that's the level we're at right now, and then exponentially increase it to the power of 30.
[00:10:08.202 --> 00:10:09.862]  Well, that's easy.
[00:10:09.862 --> 00:10:18.026]  Now the issue here is, things are a lot more advanced than even what we're seeing.
[00:10:18.026 --> 00:10:21.047]  And when I watch the politicians, when I watch the elites at Davos,
[00:10:22.386 --> 00:10:25.947]  The last decade or so, it's almost like they don't even care we're here.
[00:10:25.947 --> 00:10:41.153]  It's as if they're so distracted by the things they know, the things they're aware of, the satisfied looks on their faces don't match the body language and behavior and sociology of past elites.
[00:10:41.153 --> 00:10:50.756]  Even a JFK or a John D. Rockefeller or a Queen Mother or an Adolf Hitler.
[00:10:52.623 --> 00:10:56.065]  Or a Emperor Haruhito.
[00:10:56.065 --> 00:10:57.625]  They were still tied into society.
[00:10:57.625 --> 00:11:00.147]  They still cared about movie stars.
[00:11:00.147 --> 00:11:02.328]  And they still cared about literary achievements.
[00:11:02.328 --> 00:11:06.169]  And they still even wanted to be part of the world.
[00:11:06.169 --> 00:11:17.695]  The elite, more and more, are completely removed from the hype, the society, the control systems they themselves have, in many cases, created or expanded.
[00:11:18.663 --> 00:11:24.024]  They're really good at taking existing platforms and just expanding them and using them for their own programs.
[00:11:24.024 --> 00:11:30.226]  This is a scientific dictatorship.
[00:11:30.226 --> 00:11:35.887]  There is no doubt they have very powerful life extension technologies.
[00:11:35.887 --> 00:11:43.969]  I wouldn't say that they have the power of immortality, because people die in car wrecks, people die in helicopter crashes, people slip and fall and hit their head.
[00:11:45.896 --> 00:11:48.897]  Even if they have cures for cancer and things.
[00:11:48.897 --> 00:11:52.438]  Tissue just wears out and falls apart.
[00:11:52.438 --> 00:11:56.139]  But they do test all their new technological developments on us.
[00:11:56.139 --> 00:11:58.960]  That's why the medical profession is called a practice.
[00:11:58.960 --> 00:12:00.061]  A medical practice.
[00:12:00.061 --> 00:12:01.121]  A surgical practice.
[00:12:01.121 --> 00:12:02.522]  A dental practice.
[00:12:02.522 --> 00:12:06.383]  An eye surgery practice.
[00:12:06.383 --> 00:12:07.443]  They are practicing.
[00:12:07.443 --> 00:12:08.684]  They are always getting better.
[00:12:08.684 --> 00:12:11.845]  They are always trying to raise the state of the art.
[00:12:11.845 --> 00:12:12.405]  It is an art.
[00:12:14.011 --> 00:12:17.933]  Integrated into a science, but science itself is an art.
[00:12:17.933 --> 00:12:34.683]  So there is no doubt they have incredible life extension technologies already, and the elites say themselves that if they can just extend them another 10, 20, 30 years, that elites that are 40, 50 years old today are going to be able to live, for all intents and purposes, forever.
[00:12:38.100 --> 00:12:54.172]  Because they say if they can extend their life out another 50 to 100 years, then there is no doubt they're going to be able to merge with the cybernetic interfaces, with the biotech, with the robotics.
[00:12:54.172 --> 00:13:02.659]  20 years ago, they were engaging in brain surgeries that were giving the blind limited black and white sight.
[00:13:06.206 --> 00:13:14.052]  They're just now allowing that to be available to some of the blind.
[00:13:14.052 --> 00:13:23.320]  But under bioethics, under eugenics, under the carbon footprint, they're openly saying the general public is not going to have access to this.
[00:13:23.320 --> 00:13:26.082]  There's going to be a rationing of this.
[00:13:26.082 --> 00:13:31.026]  They're saying the healthcare cost is too great because it's vertically integrated and it's a monopoly.
[00:13:33.203 --> 00:13:40.906]  And they want a global government so many of these new advanced treatments can't take hold in other nations that are under their control.
[00:13:40.906 --> 00:13:42.907]  They can't have Iran standing alone.
[00:13:42.907 --> 00:13:44.328]  They can't have Libya standing alone.
[00:13:44.328 --> 00:13:53.532]  They can't have any nation standing alone because high-tech systems will develop there.
[00:13:53.532 --> 00:13:59.914]  That's why any high-tech developments have to be sabotaged by spies.
[00:13:59.914 --> 00:14:00.875]  By saboteurs.
[00:14:02.998 --> 00:14:04.778]  And that's what the NSA does.
[00:14:04.778 --> 00:14:11.800]  They identify who's developing a technological system that the globalists already discovered decades before, who may be trying to develop it.
[00:14:11.800 --> 00:14:16.901]  And many of the assassinations, the hits, the murders, it's done against microbiologists.
[00:14:16.901 --> 00:14:18.782]  It's done against tinkers.
[00:14:18.782 --> 00:14:20.502]  It's done against inventors.
[00:14:20.502 --> 00:14:22.943]  It's done against small companies.
[00:14:22.943 --> 00:14:26.263]  If they don't sell, they die.
[00:14:26.263 --> 00:14:28.684]  Or they get audited, or they get shut down.
[00:14:28.684 --> 00:14:32.145]  The globalists are in charge because they mean business.
[00:14:34.005 --> 00:14:35.587]  They're professional.
[00:14:35.587 --> 00:14:37.831]  They're focused.
[00:14:37.831 --> 00:14:42.818]  They know what the prize is, the world and human evolution and development of the stars.
[00:14:42.818 --> 00:14:47.405]  And they don't intend for most of us in our progeny to be part of that.
[00:14:47.405 --> 00:14:50.169]  And I don't like being walled off in the global reservation.
[00:14:51.098 --> 00:14:54.921]  Outside the true technological reservations that are above the level we're at.
[00:14:54.921 --> 00:14:59.765]  I don't like my children not being able to have access to the full human potential and destiny.
[00:14:59.765 --> 00:15:04.729]  I don't like my food and water being drugged and being poisoned with chemicals.
[00:15:04.729 --> 00:15:11.094]  I don't like open terraforming, geoengineering going on openly around me.
[00:15:12.574 --> 00:15:27.324]  And the public so mind-numbed, so mind-smashed, so distracted and diverted by distractions and petty issues that I'm sitting here bringing you the absolute heart of the matter.
[00:15:27.324 --> 00:15:34.709]  And many of you can't even grasp what I'm saying when it's so elementary.
[00:15:34.709 --> 00:15:39.412]  It is elementary.
[00:15:39.412 --> 00:15:40.113]  Elementary.
[00:15:42.386 --> 00:15:53.069]  I was on the treadmill this morning watching some HBO sports documentary where they were looking at the famous Ethiopian runner.
[00:15:53.069 --> 00:15:53.830]  I forgot the name.
[00:15:53.830 --> 00:15:56.170]  I hit record so I can watch the rest of it when I get back to town.
[00:15:56.170 --> 00:16:04.733]  I'm going to LA for a few days this weekend on business, very important business.
[00:16:04.733 --> 00:16:08.034]  And I was running on the treadmill for an hour this morning.
[00:16:10.217 --> 00:16:12.238]  And, uh, watched a lot of the show.
[00:16:12.238 --> 00:16:20.520]  It was about the famous Russian wrestler and it was about the, uh, different individuals.
[00:16:20.520 --> 00:16:30.363]  And while I was talking about the Russian wrestler, the big three-time gold medal winner, Alexander something.
[00:16:30.363 --> 00:16:37.625]  The point is that it, they read a quote from Homer.
[00:16:37.625 --> 00:16:38.505]  So I ran in.
[00:16:40.146 --> 00:16:47.971]  After I got off the treadmill and printed it and then of course forgotten and left the house and didn't bring it but maybe I'll pull it up during a break.
[00:16:47.971 --> 00:17:06.822]  The issue is that I already knew this and I already read quotes by Cicero and I already read quotes by Josephus and I already read quotes by Roman and Greek and Jewish historians in their contemporary time, thousands of years ago.
[00:17:09.870 --> 00:17:19.952]  And quotes by Julius Caesar and quotes by Cicero and about how sports and gladiatorial events are used to control you.
[00:17:19.952 --> 00:17:38.196]  But I've never seen the quote by Homer, but they, uh, the narrator gave the quote describing the wrestler and going back to, uh, 700 BC to when wrestling Greco Roman began in Greece.
[00:17:43.699 --> 00:18:02.347]  And Homer was saying this is really great that sports are becoming very popular because now it is supplanting war making as the only heroes we've got and as the leaders of society.
[00:18:02.347 --> 00:18:12.851]  And now the new heroes are the wrestlers and the runners and the javelin throwers above everything else.
[00:18:14.969 --> 00:18:24.618]  And so the only avenue to show your manhood will not be war and conflict, and physical battle and political battle.
[00:18:24.618 --> 00:18:26.940]  I mean, that's Homer.
[00:18:26.940 --> 00:18:41.312]  Two thousand plus years ago, describing that our heroes are football players and basketball players and baseball players, but the issue is, he was saying it was good because it could be used to
[00:18:42.586 --> 00:18:50.732]  End the Greek city-states constantly warring with each other just because that was their profession.
[00:18:50.732 --> 00:18:52.614]  That was what they did.
[00:18:52.614 --> 00:19:01.000]  That was the age of true chivalry or the prototype of it.
[00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:08.346]  It's the same thing you saw with the kind of the end of the Napoleonic ideal of war being so romantic at the Alamo in 1836 where
[00:19:10.871 --> 00:19:12.312]  They almost wanted to die.
[00:19:12.312 --> 00:19:21.198]  It was a great honor to fight 4,000 troops against 186.
[00:19:21.198 --> 00:19:25.341]  Victory or death, they wanted to die.
[00:19:25.341 --> 00:19:30.004]  Because, and it wasn't that they wanted to be tough guys, they were into not being afraid to die.
[00:19:30.004 --> 00:19:34.387]  They were into the rush of being surrounded and being attacked.
[00:19:34.387 --> 00:19:38.731]  Now see, sociologists and globalist planners can advertise it's good
[00:19:41.212 --> 00:19:50.319]  That men now have had their war-making instinct taken, but the way they've implanted and used this, it's actually been a great disease.
[00:19:50.319 --> 00:19:57.965]  And I want to detail that and a lot more when we get back and talk about the true nature of the planetary system we now live under.
[00:19:57.965 --> 00:19:58.446]  Stay with us.
[00:20:00.729 --> 00:20:04.170]  Silver is mankind's oldest natural antibiotic.
[00:20:04.170 --> 00:20:08.411]  This very special mineral has been used for centuries by most cultures throughout the world.
[00:20:08.411 --> 00:20:20.073]  Utopia, Texas is home to a small but mighty supplement company called Utopia Silver, who offers colloidal products produced in distilled water without use of animal protein, nitrates or saline solutions.
[00:20:20.073 --> 00:20:25.674]  Because our colloidal silver is made up of nano-sized particles, it can be better utilized at the cellular level.
[00:20:25.694 --> 00:20:26.214]  I think so.
[00:20:47.349 --> 00:20:55.155]  Visit us today at utopiasilver.com, that's U-T-O-P-I-A, silver.com, or call 888-213-4338, 888-213-4338, and help us win this battle.
[00:20:55.155 --> 00:20:57.357]  Good day, Jim Newcomer from Midas Resources.
[00:20:57.357 --> 00:20:57.778]  July 16, 2009.
[00:20:57.778 --> 00:20:58.758]  Gold opened this morning at $940.
[00:20:58.758 --> 00:21:02.221]  A one-ounce gold coin can be purchased for $966.96, $4348 for a half-ounce, or $241.74 for the quarter-ounce.
[00:21:13.991 --> 00:21:16.153]  That's $966.96, $483.48, or $241.74.
[00:21:16.153 --> 00:21:22.019]  Bailout equals market distortions increase money supply while productivity is going down.
[00:21:22.019 --> 00:21:26.243]  Wall Street is receiving injections of liquidity while smaller companies are forced to concede.
[00:21:26.243 --> 00:21:30.708]  Companies too big to fail are now using the tax dollars to increase market share paying fat dividends.
[00:21:30.868 --> 00:21:36.410]  Are you wondering why supplies of gold and silver coins are decreasing rapidly, leaving the public scrambling to accumulate what's left?
[00:21:36.410 --> 00:21:39.671]  Fiat currency's value is based on trust, fiscal responsibility.
[00:21:39.671 --> 00:21:44.573]  Is Congress and the White House acting responsibly, earning your trust, or is it time to insure your hard-earned wealth?
[00:21:44.573 --> 00:21:47.834]  Midas Resources offers economic insurance, gold and silver coins, 800-686-2237.
[00:21:47.834 --> 00:21:54.337]  Do you believe that more bailout will solve our economic problems, or would you like to call Midas Resources at 1-800-686-2237?
[00:21:54.337 --> 00:21:55.517]  That's Midas Resources at 1-800-686-2237.
[00:22:00.999 --> 00:22:06.803]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:22:06.803 --> 00:22:14.389]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[00:22:14.389 --> 00:22:20.554]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:22:20.974 --> 00:22:22.936]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:22:22.936 --> 00:22:25.458]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[00:22:25.458 --> 00:22:37.026]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[00:22:37.026 --> 00:22:38.708]  It's not about left or right.
[00:22:38.708 --> 00:22:40.569]  It's about a one-world government.
[00:22:40.569 --> 00:22:46.794]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[00:22:47.466 --> 00:22:55.733]  Get your copy of the Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:22:55.733 --> 00:22:57.295]  The Obama Deception.
[00:22:57.295 --> 00:22:58.496]  The people strike back!
[00:23:01.949 --> 00:23:03.451]  Recognize that sound?
[00:23:03.451 --> 00:23:08.236]  If you're taking vitamins and minerals in pill form, that's exactly where many are ending up.
[00:23:08.236 --> 00:23:10.698]  Hello, my name is Dr. David Friedman.
[00:23:10.698 --> 00:23:16.024]  According to the physician's desk reference, vitamins in a pill form are 10% absorbed.
[00:23:16.024 --> 00:23:21.430]  So for every $100 you spend on vitamins, that's $90 you're flushing down the toilet.
[00:23:21.430 --> 00:23:24.553]  In fact, orderlies at hospitals call these bedpan bullets.
[00:23:24.833 --> 00:23:27.296]  Start absorbing the nutrients you swallow.

[00:24:17.495 --> 00:24:17.775]  Gravedigger!
[00:24:17.775 --> 00:24:18.356]  So I can feel the rain.
[00:24:42.935 --> 00:24:45.296]  We love you, Willie.
[00:24:45.296 --> 00:24:46.837]  It's hard to cut this song off.
[00:24:46.837 --> 00:24:56.882]  You should never have to watch your only children lowered in the ground.
[00:25:10.988 --> 00:25:13.309]  All right, we are back live.
[00:25:13.309 --> 00:25:18.910]  Thank you for joining us today.
[00:25:38.564 --> 00:25:50.454]  Coming up in about an hour and 40 minutes, Wayne Paul, brother of Dr. Ron Paul, will be joining us, then Dr. Rima E. Labo, medical doctor, and Albert N. Semblevine III, Major General.
[00:25:50.454 --> 00:25:59.722]  We'll talk about the soft kill operation that's going on, the New World Order.
[00:25:59.722 --> 00:26:05.027]  Okay, I got massive stacks of news here, but I've got some notes I want to go over, just basic philosophy, how the system works.
[00:26:07.935 --> 00:26:33.759]  My whole point in quoting Homer, one of the Greek philosophers, an ancient Greek philosopher, is that they understood what made people tick back then, and somehow the establishment media, the social engineers, convinced our culture to not even self-analyze ourselves, or not understand what makes humans tick, or not understand our basic instincts.
[00:26:35.845 --> 00:26:43.272]  And to not even look at how the advertisement and the media and the corporate system is programming us.
[00:26:43.272 --> 00:26:51.500]  In fact, they call it a conspiracy theorist, a conspiracy theory, if you even say somebody's trying to program you.
[00:26:51.500 --> 00:26:53.561]  If you even say there's a ruling elite.
[00:26:53.561 --> 00:26:55.303]  If you even say there's a corrupt elite.
[00:26:55.303 --> 00:27:00.388]  If you even say there's any subterfuge in the courts of government, in the courts of kings.
[00:27:02.048 --> 00:27:12.621]  And it's anyone who knows history knows what an outlandish, ridiculous fraud it is and how paper thin and flimsy and silly it is.
[00:27:14.855 --> 00:27:17.476]  And I'm beginning to realize we're under mass mind control.
[00:27:17.476 --> 00:27:26.401]  Much of the public believes there's no world government, no move towards world government, no North American Union, no Asian Union, no African Union, no American Union.
[00:27:26.401 --> 00:27:28.142]  They don't know anything.
[00:27:28.142 --> 00:27:30.423]  They don't know there's a new Bank of the World being shut up.
[00:27:30.423 --> 00:27:34.325]  They don't know there's a new global tax being shut up for carbon taxes.
[00:27:34.325 --> 00:27:38.267]  They don't know there's a new global currency that's going to be cashless being shut up.
[00:27:38.267 --> 00:27:39.208]  All being announced!
[00:27:40.731 --> 00:27:44.712]  Because they were told for decades it didn't exist and crazy people talked about it.
[00:27:44.712 --> 00:27:55.994]  Now, even as it's announced, they will announce it on the news in a newscast, in a prepared piece, and then cut to the news anchor who makes fun of it and laughs at their own report.
[00:27:55.994 --> 00:28:06.375]  And the message is, we're telling you this is going on, but it's not kosher, it's not acceptable for you to accept it's real.
[00:28:06.375 --> 00:28:10.076]  So we're telling you we're going to do this, but you are to engage in double-think
[00:28:11.460 --> 00:28:18.466]  And accept it and lay down and not resist it, and at the same time say it doesn't exist.
[00:28:18.466 --> 00:28:35.539]  That's like people, they would march into the shooting ranges at the death camps, into those pits, those mass graves, and they would see people run into the mass grave and shot, and then they would wait, and they would say, run in there now, and they would, they'd say go, they'd give them the order, and they'd run into the pit and follow orders.
[00:28:36.912 --> 00:28:39.754]  And that's what the American people have turned into.
[00:28:39.754 --> 00:28:42.476]  We're running into the pit for the Federal Reserve to rape us.
[00:28:42.476 --> 00:28:44.497]  We're running into the pit for the police state.
[00:28:44.497 --> 00:28:47.519]  We're running into the pit for our nation's borders to be destroyed.
[00:28:47.519 --> 00:28:50.141]  We're running into the pit drinking the sodium fluoride water.
[00:28:50.141 --> 00:28:53.403]  We're running into the mass grave pit taking the inoculations.
[00:28:54.750 --> 00:28:56.672]  And on and on and on.
[00:28:56.672 --> 00:29:03.380]  We're running into the pit accepting the news saying torture of children in front of their parents is good and pro-America and pro-freedom.
[00:29:03.380 --> 00:29:05.883]  We're running into the pit accepting evil.
[00:29:05.883 --> 00:29:12.931]  When you accept that, oh, Bill Clinton lies, George Bush lies, Obama lies, you know, that's just what they do, you've now capitulated.
[00:29:12.931 --> 00:29:14.172]  You've now given in.
[00:29:14.172 --> 00:29:15.494]  When you give in, it's over.
[00:29:17.423 --> 00:29:19.264]  And it's because you've lost your fighting spirit.
[00:29:19.264 --> 00:29:27.391]  Your fighting spirit to make war and to fight and to speak out and to step up is meant to protect your tribe and your family.
[00:29:27.391 --> 00:29:38.259]  But see, men have had all their manly energy secreted and misdirected into sports, as Homer said thousands of years ago.
[00:29:38.259 --> 00:29:38.559]  And so,
[00:29:39.648 --> 00:29:45.114]  You're busy playing child's games while the New World Order wages real war on humanity.
[00:29:45.114 --> 00:29:46.695]  See, they're living in the real world.
[00:29:46.695 --> 00:29:47.536]  They live.
[00:29:47.536 --> 00:29:48.577]  We sleep.
[00:29:48.577 --> 00:29:50.880]  Awaken!
[00:29:50.880 --> 00:29:52.281]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.281 --> 00:29:54.804]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.804 --> 00:29:57.507]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:00.250 --> 00:30:06.113]  This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you again about a company that has supported us in the truth movement for years.
[00:30:06.113 --> 00:30:07.413]  Inner Health Botanicals.
[00:30:07.413 --> 00:30:11.695]  This company produces the highest quality superfood around, called Inner Food.
[00:30:11.695 --> 00:30:13.556]  My wife just loves the stuff.

[00:30:25.601 --> 00:30:28.601]  It would be impossible to blend this up for a better price.
[00:30:28.601 --> 00:30:30.322]  And their formula really works.
[00:30:30.322 --> 00:30:33.143]  This is the real thing for the great health you need.
[00:30:33.143 --> 00:30:34.623]  Try the NutriCafe.
[00:30:34.623 --> 00:30:39.405]  Their great organic coffee infused with polysaccharides that boost the immune system.
[00:30:39.405 --> 00:30:41.806]  A truly healthy coffee that tastes great.
[00:30:41.806 --> 00:30:44.267]  And take it from me folks, it really does taste great.
[00:30:44.267 --> 00:30:46.367]  Don't forget to try their other great products.

[00:31:00.112 --> 00:31:04.354]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones and I want each of you to ask yourself this question.
[00:31:04.354 --> 00:31:06.355]  Do you really know what's in your tap water?
[00:31:06.355 --> 00:31:14.618]  In a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor, they found that over 260 chemicals and pollutants are present in municipal drinking water.
[00:31:14.878 --> 00:31:20.422]  Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive, immune, and developmental system diseases.
[00:31:20.422 --> 00:31:22.283]  Now, what are you going to do about it?
[00:31:22.283 --> 00:31:28.807]  The Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator is a low-cost way to take back control of you and your family's drinking water.
[00:31:28.807 --> 00:31:33.330]  The Ecola Blue 28 produces up to 7 gallons of water from the humidity in the atmosphere.
[00:31:33.570 --> 00:31:33.990]  That's right.
[00:32:00.506 --> 00:32:01.807]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:32:01.807 --> 00:32:07.413]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[00:32:07.413 --> 00:32:12.418]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[00:32:12.418 --> 00:32:17.463]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again.
[00:32:17.992 --> 00:32:23.216]  So our friends at Solutions From Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[00:32:23.216 --> 00:32:25.517]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank.
[00:32:25.517 --> 00:32:30.320]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[00:32:30.320 --> 00:32:31.441]  And here's the best part.
[00:32:31.441 --> 00:32:34.203]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[00:32:34.203 --> 00:32:38.146]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[00:32:38.146 --> 00:32:41.328]  So visit them today at SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[00:32:41.328 --> 00:32:43.549]  That's SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[00:32:43.549 --> 00:32:44.470]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[00:32:48.112 --> 00:32:51.073]  That's 877-327-0365.
[00:32:51.073 --> 00:32:57.174]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[00:32:57.174 --> 00:32:59.575]  This is Alex Jones for SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[00:33:16.591 --> 00:33:18.132]  We'll ride again!
[00:33:18.132 --> 00:33:26.799]  I am a Midwest farmer, I make a living off the land.
[00:33:26.799 --> 00:33:31.362]  I ride a John Deere tractor, I'm a liberated man.
[00:33:31.362 --> 00:33:36.206]  The rain, it hasn't fallen since the middle of July.
[00:33:36.206 --> 00:33:39.088]  And if it don't come soon, my crops will die.
[00:33:41.016 --> 00:33:45.541]  The bankman says he likes me, but there's nothing he can do.
[00:33:45.541 --> 00:33:49.985]  He tells me that he's coming, but the clouds are coming too.
[00:33:49.985 --> 00:33:57.412]  He ain't my friend, and I'll ride again.
[00:33:57.412 --> 00:33:59.995]  Don't give up, don't let them break your spirit.
[00:33:59.995 --> 00:34:04.680]  Only let their attacks intensify the power of your heart and soul.
[00:34:09.611 --> 00:34:13.214]  All right, we got Wayne Paul coming up in an hour and a half.
[00:34:13.214 --> 00:34:14.755]  I'm really looking forward to that.
[00:34:14.755 --> 00:34:20.239]  And General Stubblebine and Dr. Labo, very informative as well.
[00:34:20.239 --> 00:34:26.524]  They are beginning the brainwashing for forced inoculations in Europe, England, the United States, Canada, Australia, everywhere.
[00:34:26.524 --> 00:34:34.110]  I've got a disgusting local newscast I want to break down and analyze coming up later as well in the next hour.
[00:34:34.110 --> 00:34:37.812]  I do want to go ahead and just fire out the toll-free phone number.
[00:34:38.735 --> 00:34:44.117]  Because I'm gonna start taking calls at the beginning of the next hour and covering a blitzkrieg of news.
[00:34:44.117 --> 00:34:45.377]  And boy, is it all important.
[00:34:45.377 --> 00:34:47.598]  1-800-259-9231 1-800-259-9231 But as they say, once more into the breach.
[00:34:47.598 --> 00:34:48.879]  And so into the valley of death, Road 600.
[00:34:48.879 --> 00:34:51.560]  Forget who said that, I don't know if part of it's Shakespeare.
[00:35:12.759 --> 00:35:20.686]  You know, constantly at night and in the morning I write notes about thoughts and points I want to make.
[00:35:20.686 --> 00:35:21.567]  And it needs to be done.
[00:35:21.567 --> 00:35:24.990]  I'm going to talk about some of these issues.
[00:35:24.990 --> 00:35:27.292]  Larger issues.
[00:35:27.292 --> 00:35:31.676]  Overall philosophy issues.
[00:35:31.676 --> 00:35:37.561]  But I assure you, new listeners, if you will simply follow your instincts,
[00:35:38.780 --> 00:35:40.562]  Because I know what your gut's telling you right now.
[00:35:40.562 --> 00:35:42.563]  It's telling you I'm telling you the truth.
[00:35:42.563 --> 00:35:44.765]  Because I do tell the truth.
[00:35:44.765 --> 00:35:47.748]  And I do my research.
[00:35:47.748 --> 00:35:49.289]  Does that mean I always get it right?
[00:35:49.289 --> 00:35:51.251]  No.
[00:35:51.251 --> 00:35:53.553]  But I try to get it right.
[00:35:53.553 --> 00:35:55.074]  And we're frighteningly accurate here.
[00:35:55.074 --> 00:36:00.078]  I'd say 95% plus.
[00:36:00.078 --> 00:36:03.081]  I was about to say 98, but it sounds obnoxious.
[00:36:03.081 --> 00:36:03.741]  It's above 95% accuracy.
[00:36:06.849 --> 00:36:14.774]  Most of our inaccuracy is underestimating evil.
[00:36:14.774 --> 00:36:28.544]  It's hard for me to imagine that there are hundreds of thousands of people, conservatively, sociologists and psychologists and criminologists predict, bare minimum,
[00:36:29.477 --> 00:36:43.410]  In the world, hundreds of thousands, probably more, that enjoy kidnapping little children and torturing them to death for weeks and then killing them.
[00:36:43.410 --> 00:36:54.481]  That is hard for me to imagine that there are people who enjoy torturing innocent people to death.
[00:36:58.581 --> 00:37:22.356]  But just because that is 180 degrees alien from what most of us believe in, in what most of us love, in what most of us like, in what most of our tastes are, nevertheless, those individuals are amongst us.
[00:37:22.356 --> 00:37:24.317]  And there's different debates on it.
[00:37:25.373 --> 00:37:27.574]  Different psychological reports have been done on it.
[00:37:27.574 --> 00:37:31.015]  Some quackery, some quite accurate.
[00:37:31.015 --> 00:37:38.537]  Some estimates have as many as two psychopaths for every hundred people.
[00:37:38.537 --> 00:37:45.019]  Most of the studies show, on average, about one psychopath for every hundred people.
[00:37:45.019 --> 00:37:49.540]  And guess how many sociopaths there are for every hundred?
[00:37:49.540 --> 00:37:52.581]  Some gauges have twenty percent
[00:37:53.766 --> 00:37:56.167]  Being sociopaths.
[00:37:56.167 --> 00:37:59.348]  That is, they don't enjoy killing you, they just don't care if you die.
[00:37:59.348 --> 00:38:14.793]  See, a psychopath enjoys it, and enjoys the power trip of it.
[00:38:14.793 --> 00:38:18.534]  And so what you have is psychopaths, high-functioning psychopaths,
[00:38:21.047 --> 00:38:26.552]  In command of legions of sociopaths.
[00:38:26.552 --> 00:38:36.760]  The psychopaths also command legions of people that like to be enslaved and people that like to serve psychopaths.
[00:38:36.760 --> 00:38:38.161]  The whip-me-beat-me types.
[00:38:38.161 --> 00:38:46.788]  In fact, many of their most dangerous operatives are the chicken-neck ghoul variety that I so loathe.
[00:38:53.356 --> 00:38:55.897]  And then of course they have the sadistic sadists.
[00:38:55.897 --> 00:38:57.058]  They have armies of them.
[00:38:57.058 --> 00:39:17.110]  And they operate, the virus of tyranny operates best in a fat and decadent, spoiled environment.
[00:39:17.110 --> 00:39:19.811]  And boy, isn't America the epitome of that?
[00:39:19.811 --> 00:39:20.832]  Fat, dumb, and happy.
[00:39:22.219 --> 00:39:28.123]  It's like rotten, stagnant water that you've pumped a thousand gallons of fresh sewage into.
[00:39:28.123 --> 00:39:42.674]  Oh, it's already full of bacteria and filth, but it's going to become pure cess sludge.
[00:39:42.674 --> 00:39:45.957]  Pure detritus.
[00:39:45.957 --> 00:39:47.878]  Liquid E. coli.
[00:39:47.878 --> 00:39:48.699]  Liquid death.
[00:39:50.115 --> 00:40:10.830]  Only the New World Order would come up with an artificial sweetener that rots holes in your brains, kills your cells in mass, attacks every organ, attacks your pancreas, and is the defecation of genetically engineered E. coli bacteria.
[00:40:10.830 --> 00:40:13.312]  Only the New World Order would come up with that.
[00:40:13.312 --> 00:40:15.954]  And everything they do is a wicked invention.
[00:40:15.954 --> 00:40:16.995]  They are creators.
[00:40:19.502 --> 00:40:21.444]  They mimic God.
[00:40:21.444 --> 00:40:32.352]  They counterfeit God, but in a twisted, stinking way.
[00:40:32.352 --> 00:40:35.515]  What they do?
[00:40:35.515 --> 00:40:39.578]  They are creators.
[00:40:39.578 --> 00:40:48.886]  Made in the image of the creator of the universe, but twisted and dark, with a dark logic, a different science, a different language of mathematics.
[00:40:51.152 --> 00:41:04.038]  They come from the gulfs, the black gulfs of pain and suffering.
[00:41:04.038 --> 00:41:09.861]  They hate the light, so they seek to tear it down, to topple it, to overturn it!
[00:41:09.861 --> 00:41:16.705]  Psychopaths, and I've interviewed some of the top
[00:41:18.103 --> 00:41:20.844]  Psychiatrists that have interviewed some of the most famous psychopaths here on air.
[00:41:20.844 --> 00:41:22.265]  In fact, I forget that lady's name.
[00:41:22.265 --> 00:41:25.267]  We need to get her back on when I interviewed all the psychos.
[00:41:25.267 --> 00:41:25.887]  Had her on years ago.
[00:41:25.887 --> 00:41:26.427]  It was amazing.
[00:41:26.427 --> 00:41:32.731]  I've got to create a list of all these powerful guests and then we have them on once and then we have them on again.
[00:41:32.731 --> 00:41:45.858]  And she was describing what they, uh, the best cinema description of it would be the remake of the Manchurian Candidate that whenever he goes under mind control,
[00:41:46.912 --> 00:41:48.173]  Everything kind of glows.
[00:41:48.173 --> 00:41:49.153]  Everything's like brilliant.
[00:41:49.153 --> 00:41:51.215]  He feels totally alive.
[00:41:51.215 --> 00:41:55.477]  Whenever they give him the program words, everything blazes.
[00:41:55.477 --> 00:42:00.401]  And a psychopath is depressed and unhappy and upset.
[00:42:00.401 --> 00:42:00.881]  Generally.
[00:42:03.251 --> 00:42:13.674]  And only feels alive when they've got a child chained down, burning them with cigarettes and electrical wires and torturing them and begging and hearing them sob for their mother.
[00:42:13.674 --> 00:42:15.414]  It's like blazing, burning light.
[00:42:15.414 --> 00:42:16.534]  It's like life.
[00:42:16.534 --> 00:42:17.735]  Oh, it's beautiful.
[00:42:17.735 --> 00:42:21.556]  While they're killing the goodness and the innocence.
[00:42:21.556 --> 00:42:25.477]  So you want to know why Bill Gates is so happy?
[00:42:25.477 --> 00:42:29.578]  He's one of the biggest eugenicists in history, folks.
[00:42:31.294 --> 00:42:34.958]  I think it's a fair estimate to say he has tens of billions worldwide for eugenics.
[00:42:34.958 --> 00:42:39.663]  He's probably got more Megadeths under his belt than Adolf A. Louis Hitler.
[00:42:39.663 --> 00:42:45.030]  I don't think he has Mao championed yet, but he'll get there.
[00:42:45.030 --> 00:42:50.075]  He's as happy as a pig, and you know what?
[00:42:50.075 --> 00:42:50.616]  And he likes it.
[00:42:53.106 --> 00:43:00.390]  And he's organized, and he's focused, and he's professional, and he's laughing at you, and he understands sociology and psychology, and he enjoys it.
[00:43:00.390 --> 00:43:05.032]  He enjoys walking through an airport and just looking at everybody he's running black ops on.
[00:43:05.032 --> 00:43:07.293]  It's a little special secret to him.
[00:43:07.293 --> 00:43:20.380]  He is, to the power of infinity, the archetype of the punk busboy who puts a booger in somebody's fettuccine alfredo.
[00:43:20.380 --> 00:43:22.201]  And I've seen a busboy do that.
[00:43:25.191 --> 00:43:32.017]  I saw him in a little dark hallway from my table looking back where the plates were being put up, steaming for the people.
[00:43:32.017 --> 00:43:41.966]  Maybe somebody had given him a weird look because he was so insecure and neurotic and just a biological android, a suboid demon.
[00:43:41.966 --> 00:43:46.930]  And he had that power to stick his finger in his nose and to stick that booger right in that food.
[00:43:46.930 --> 00:43:52.815]  And that's what Bill Gates is, but a giant, powerful, spoiled, wicked little busboy.
[00:43:55.609 --> 00:44:01.892]  And he's going to stick sodium fluoride in your water, he's going to give you special shots that are going to make you feel real good.
[00:44:01.892 --> 00:44:10.957]  Because he is a smiley face, demon-eyed, right out of the pit of hell, and I swear eternal resistance to you.
[00:44:10.957 --> 00:44:20.582]  And I spend my life, and I spend my fortune, and I spend my soul and my energy ramming straight into you with everything I got.
[00:44:24.144 --> 00:44:30.545]  Damn the maneuvers, I'm going straight at ya!
[00:44:30.545 --> 00:44:51.650]  And I'm committed, you little devil in disguise!
[00:44:51.650 --> 00:44:51.810]  Now...
[00:44:56.294 --> 00:45:20.309]  The issue to men out there is some of the more dominant Greek city-states were tired of the city-states killing each other and they decided to focus their activities outward and it's at that time that the state inculcated sports into daily life so that the men wouldn't kill each other.
[00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:28.443]  Because that was the object of human development.
[00:45:28.443 --> 00:45:32.187]  That was the object of showing your will.
[00:45:32.187 --> 00:45:33.368]  It was the great contest.
[00:45:33.368 --> 00:45:37.132]  It was what focused the mind.
[00:45:37.132 --> 00:45:45.180]  You get in an arena with somebody with a short sword and a little shield, believe me, everything goes very slow, life is very real, the sand sparkles.
[00:45:46.167 --> 00:45:48.488]  The sky gleams.
[00:45:48.488 --> 00:45:49.629]  You are totally alive.
[00:45:49.629 --> 00:45:58.273]  It is another mirror into what the psychopath is seeing, but much, much deeper and more real.
[00:45:58.273 --> 00:46:02.215]  Because it's not some child chained down to a bed, having their teeth pulled out.
[00:46:02.215 --> 00:46:09.198]  It is a vicious man, rippling with muscles and focus, who is going to kill you.
[00:46:09.198 --> 00:46:11.839]  And it is real.
[00:46:11.839 --> 00:46:13.400]  And it is an animating contest.
[00:46:14.580 --> 00:46:15.565]  Of liberty!
[00:46:15.565 --> 00:46:16.952]  Who will survive?
[00:46:19.898 --> 00:46:24.379]  And so that's why you go paint yourself up in war paint and yell and scream at a football game.
[00:46:24.379 --> 00:46:28.140]  And it's not even bad in and of itself except that you're not in the arena.
[00:46:28.140 --> 00:46:35.002]  You are now learning to live through other men and through other women instead of being in the arena yourself.
[00:46:35.002 --> 00:46:41.784]  And let me tell you what those instincts for war and strength and what those instincts to get up in front of a crowd are for.
[00:46:41.784 --> 00:46:44.805]  It is for leadership to defend the women and children.
[00:46:46.857 --> 00:47:00.190]  But as societies got larger and became agrarian, and as city-states were developed, then it was more sophisticated and more mechanized to have war with your neighbor and survive, and it became a science.
[00:47:00.190 --> 00:47:07.317]  And then the science of war became light years more sophisticated than it was thousands of years ago.
[00:47:07.317 --> 00:47:10.020]  Toward now, the directed energies of the system
[00:47:11.041 --> 00:47:16.688]  Or the overclass, using the entire scientific funding mechanisms of the nation states.
[00:47:19.155 --> 00:47:29.645]  To form a world government that then destroys the nation states and brings in a planetary regime of oppression and control and sterilization and micromanagement.
[00:47:29.645 --> 00:47:35.310]  A hellish global regime where everything you do and say and speak and own is chronicled.
[00:47:35.310 --> 00:47:42.056]  Where societies are squeezed and trampled and herded into control grids, into culling pens.
[00:47:43.174 --> 00:47:47.216]  And everything I've told you over these years has now been said by Pelosi.
[00:47:47.216 --> 00:47:52.679]  And said by Holdren, the czar over science.
[00:47:52.679 --> 00:48:00.424]  These bastards publish full-length textbooks detailing the grizzly operation!
[00:48:00.424 --> 00:48:05.226]  Everything I've said has been validated!
[00:48:05.226 --> 00:48:09.709]  Now, four books he's contributed to, or that he wrote in total, have now emerged.
[00:48:11.443 --> 00:48:16.368]  In total, 3,000 nightmare pages plus that must be read.
[00:48:16.368 --> 00:48:19.651]  Each new page, a grisly horror show.
[00:48:19.651 --> 00:48:20.211]  You know why?
[00:48:20.211 --> 00:48:25.956]  Because this isn't some nut, some recluse in a backwoods cabin saying this.
[00:48:25.956 --> 00:48:27.598]  This is the elite.
[00:48:27.598 --> 00:48:32.042]  He has been chosen because his textbook, and I've now read over 400 pages of it,
[00:48:33.797 --> 00:48:35.318]  He has been adopted.
[00:48:35.318 --> 00:48:37.079]  He is honored.
[00:48:37.079 --> 00:48:40.320]  They all compete with different plans that are very similar.
[00:48:40.320 --> 00:48:55.947]  And to fine-tune the current eugenics operations, and his plan, along with Ehrlich, who also advised Bush, they co-authored the book together, has been adopted!
[00:48:55.947 --> 00:49:01.270]  And so when you see headlines like, Bill Gates wants to control the weather to save the Earth from global warming,
[00:49:02.369 --> 00:49:05.372]  See, everything's going to be converted to this fake survival mechanism.
[00:49:05.372 --> 00:49:11.318]  They know you're designed and built around defense, so they create fake wars that are actually meant to destroy you.
[00:49:11.318 --> 00:49:14.381]  They create the fake terrorist, or they fund real terrorists.
[00:49:14.381 --> 00:49:19.587]  They create the fake environmental movement to tax carbon that is part of the entire life cycle in all industry and all life.
[00:49:19.587 --> 00:49:21.409]  Won't you exhale two and a half pounds of a day?
[00:49:22.469 --> 00:49:38.399]  They create a fake climate system where they then use the very climate machines they've created to hurt the environment, create droughts, create floods and freak weather, and then you fund them to publicly fight what they've created.
[00:49:38.399 --> 00:49:43.082]  We'll come back, finish up with this, and go through a lot more.
[00:49:43.082 --> 00:49:44.043]  On the other side,
[00:49:52.788 --> 00:49:59.471]  You look like an angel.
[00:49:59.471 --> 00:50:01.332]  Walk like an angel.
[00:50:29.708 --> 00:50:32.469]  Get wise, folks.
[00:50:32.469 --> 00:50:35.529]  It's not cute getting suckered.
[00:50:35.529 --> 00:50:38.410]  It's not cute clinging to the terrain.
[00:51:15.725 --> 00:51:16.185]  We're good to go.
[00:51:39.713 --> 00:51:40.633]  It is a big idea.
[00:51:40.633 --> 00:51:42.234]  A new world order in the near future.
[00:52:07.040 --> 00:52:10.103]  Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[00:52:10.103 --> 00:52:12.945]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[00:52:12.945 --> 00:52:15.728]  Put their objective being world domination.
[00:52:15.728 --> 00:52:18.910]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[00:52:18.910 --> 00:52:26.217]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:52:29.244 --> 00:52:34.688]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[00:52:34.688 --> 00:52:38.550]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[00:52:38.550 --> 00:52:41.132]  Build America is making great progress toward a world government.
[00:52:41.132 --> 00:52:42.293]  Most people have no idea.
[00:52:42.293 --> 00:52:43.093]  They're not after money.
[00:52:43.093 --> 00:52:44.354]  They have all the money they need.
[00:52:44.354 --> 00:52:45.335]  They're after power.
[00:52:45.335 --> 00:52:46.496]  That's their aphrodisiac.

[00:52:58.003 --> 00:52:59.104]  You have been warned.
[00:52:59.964 --> 00:53:03.745]  Heart-related health problems affect millions of people each year.
[00:53:03.745 --> 00:53:13.889]  Maybe you're one of the many who suffer from issues related to angina pain, high blood pressure, congestive heart failure, unbalanced cholesterol, irregular heartbeat, or clogged arteries.

[00:53:46.098 --> 00:53:46.539]  We're good.
[00:54:11.777 --> 00:54:29.411]  By the way, ladies and gentlemen, this war is going on all around you, whether you know it or not.
[00:54:29.411 --> 00:54:32.753]  That's why they don't kill me and others that understand their program.
[00:54:32.753 --> 00:54:36.196]  They want to just continue their soft kill operation, slowly turning the heat up.
[00:54:41.038 --> 00:54:44.820]  The ambient background noise of death and soft kill.
[00:54:44.820 --> 00:54:48.121]  Silent weapons for quiet wars.
[00:54:48.121 --> 00:54:50.862]  They want to continue to leave the shopping malls open.
[00:54:50.862 --> 00:54:51.702]  The green hills.
[00:54:51.702 --> 00:54:52.903]  The blue sky.
[00:54:52.903 --> 00:54:53.943]  The happy girls.
[00:54:53.943 --> 00:54:57.104]  The football games.
[00:54:57.104 --> 00:55:02.246]  As the background noise of the police girding themselves in black uniforms and masks begin to march.
[00:55:02.246 --> 00:55:04.247]  As the citizen squads are formed.
[00:55:04.247 --> 00:55:06.588]  As the foreign troops drill.
[00:55:06.588 --> 00:55:08.429]  As the banks bankrupt the society.
[00:55:10.066 --> 00:55:13.668]  The FEMA camps are to be introduced as places of refuge.
[00:55:13.668 --> 00:55:15.228]  Places you want to go.
[00:55:15.228 --> 00:55:17.769]  The free medical care.
[00:55:17.769 --> 00:55:29.554]  They make you fear the flu, so you willingly come to them and willingly show the vampires your neck as they sink their fangs into the warm flesh.
[00:55:29.554 --> 00:55:31.735]  They hypnotize.
[00:55:31.735 --> 00:55:35.116]  They have you lower your defenses.
[00:55:35.116 --> 00:55:35.997]  Steal your heart.
[00:55:37.199 --> 00:55:44.502]  Fire up your soul like a giant jet engine and rise against the tyranny!
[00:55:44.502 --> 00:55:46.603]  Break the chains!
[00:55:46.603 --> 00:55:49.684]  Awaken to reality!
[00:55:49.684 --> 00:55:55.967]  Awaken to the good, the bad, and the ugly!
[00:55:55.967 --> 00:55:57.888]  Know the truth, the whole of it!
[00:56:00.944 --> 00:56:11.574]  If you make the decision to put one foot in front of the other and ask God to put you on the journey to truth, you will be given the discernment.
[00:56:11.574 --> 00:56:13.535]  You will have the veils lifted.
[00:56:13.535 --> 00:56:15.137]  You will be given great knowledge.
[00:56:17.179 --> 00:56:22.163]  But only if it is to be used to stand against the tyranny.
[00:56:22.163 --> 00:56:25.545]  To warn your fellow men and women everywhere.
[00:56:25.545 --> 00:56:28.067]  I call on the leaders.
[00:56:28.067 --> 00:56:44.899]  I call on those of you who from the day you were born, from the time you were formed in your mother's womb, the creator of the universe and all the dimensions, and all that is, and will ever be, the I am that I am.
[00:56:46.291 --> 00:56:46.871]  That's right.
[00:57:07.387 --> 00:57:20.280]  You have to go through the fire and commit, even unto death, even unto imprisonment, to sacrifice yourself in this holy cause of liberty and freedom!
[00:57:20.280 --> 00:57:24.424]  You must pledge yourself on the altar of freedom!
[00:57:24.424 --> 00:57:25.325]  You must commit!
[00:57:26.406 --> 00:57:32.467]  Your entire being and plan's eternal resistance to tyranny!
[00:57:32.467 --> 00:57:41.929]  Only now, at this point, will you be ready to take up your destiny!
[00:57:41.929 --> 00:57:51.331]  Now he sees it won't be as it lies to see.
[00:57:51.331 --> 00:57:51.891]  We live on.
[00:57:55.350 --> 00:57:58.612]  For whom the bell tolls!
[00:57:58.612 --> 00:58:00.573]  You are part of history.
[00:58:00.573 --> 00:58:03.115]  You are destiny.
[00:58:03.115 --> 00:58:23.427]  The very fact that you found this radio show, and the websites, and the news and information we cover, the very fact that you're here, means it is your destiny to be part of this great crossroads, the most important time in human history, as our destiny is being decided.
[00:58:23.427 --> 00:58:24.148]  Make no mistake,
[00:58:26.069 --> 00:58:28.591]  We are in a key juncture.
[00:58:28.591 --> 00:58:34.075]  The most important juncture thus far in the ancient history of the species.
[00:58:34.075 --> 00:58:36.436]  You feel the age, don't you?
[00:58:36.436 --> 00:58:42.160]  You feel the destiny.

[00:59:55.701 --> 00:59:58.482]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[01:00:05.023 --> 01:00:06.324]  Big Brother.
[01:00:06.324 --> 01:00:08.106]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:08.106 --> 01:00:09.867]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:09.867 --> 01:00:11.448]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.448 --> 01:00:12.329]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:12.329 --> 01:00:17.173]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.173 --> 01:00:30.423]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:30.423 --> 01:00:31.164]  We are now in
[01:00:33.234 --> 01:00:34.095]  Hour number two.
[01:00:34.095 --> 01:00:37.798]  Wayne Ball, brother of Ron Ball, great political activist in his own right.
[01:00:37.798 --> 01:00:39.159]  He's in the Obama deception.
[01:00:39.159 --> 01:00:44.043]  He'll be joining us in T-minus 59 minutes, 18 seconds.
[01:00:44.043 --> 01:00:56.212]  We have Dr. Rima E. Lebo and her husband, Albert N. Stubblevine III, Major General, joining us to talk about the soft kill slaughter grid that we're all entering into right now.
[01:00:56.212 --> 01:01:00.236]  That is coming up in the final hour.
[01:01:00.236 --> 01:01:01.657]  Truth is stranger than fiction.
[01:01:03.263 --> 01:01:23.073]  And as I said last hour, look in your heart, look in your guts, look in your soul, and realize that we are living on a beautiful planet with just wondrous opportunities all around us, but if we don't recognize the evil and fight it, it will take over!
[01:01:23.073 --> 01:01:24.654]  I'm a very positive person.
[01:01:24.654 --> 01:01:31.378]  I'm in love with life, in love with everything, except that which kills life, that which pulls down beauty.
[01:01:31.378 --> 01:01:32.018]  And it's gotta be met!
[01:01:33.757 --> 01:01:39.100]  Hello, hello Alex, can you hear me?
[01:01:54.568 --> 01:01:54.948]  Perfect.
[01:01:54.948 --> 01:01:57.489]  Hey, first off, great show.
[01:01:57.489 --> 01:01:58.749]  I appreciate the job you do.
[01:01:58.749 --> 01:02:00.070]  You do a fantastic job every day.
[01:02:00.070 --> 01:02:02.830]  I agree with about 98% of everything that you say.
[01:02:02.830 --> 01:02:05.151]  I think you're right on target for most of it.
[01:02:05.151 --> 01:02:14.353]  I was wondering if you were aware that Henry Paulson was on the Hill today being grilled by congressmen over the TARP.
[01:02:14.353 --> 01:02:16.834]  I heard he was going to be testifying, but no.
[01:02:16.834 --> 01:02:17.834]  What happened?
[01:02:17.834 --> 01:02:23.676]  Well, pretty much all the Democrats and Republicans across the board
[01:02:24.198 --> 01:02:28.181]  We're equally grillative, I guess.
[01:02:28.181 --> 01:02:30.422]  Nobody gave him much slack.
[01:02:30.422 --> 01:02:44.211]  Dennis Kucinich's main point was, you know, Ken Lewis didn't inform, as the SEC requires, Ken Lewis did not inform the shareholders of Bank of America about what he was doing until after he did it.
[01:02:44.517 --> 01:02:53.143]  Well, I mean, they criminally are vertically integrating the society, and the Federal Reserve, which Bank of America holds stock in, ordered them to do that.
[01:02:53.143 --> 01:02:57.947]  But, see, that's the false left-right paradigm, or a fake-choice split is what they're doing.
[01:02:58.843 --> 01:03:01.345]  Well, I mean, look, Bank of America is in this up to their eyeballs.
[01:03:01.345 --> 01:03:12.292]  They're just blaming it on the political guy that's already gone, so that by him being a sacrificial goat, it then passes everything else through the veil so they can move on.
[01:03:12.292 --> 01:03:24.299]  Kind of like they're burning Cheney a little bit right now, but they're just gonna give him a golden brown, you know, cooking, not anything that actually hurts him, so that they can make Obama look good and energize partisan politics.
[01:03:24.299 --> 01:03:25.360]  But, yes, go ahead.
[01:03:25.973 --> 01:03:32.275]  I think what they do to Cheney, though, strictly depends a lot, much of it depends on what we do.
[01:03:32.275 --> 01:03:41.378]  The grassroots movement was vocal enough and said, look, this man was involved up to his earlobes in all sorts of crimes.
[01:03:41.378 --> 01:03:42.479]  We need him prosecuted.
[01:03:42.479 --> 01:03:49.061]  I don't think Obama even, no matter how bought and sold he is, can avoid having the masses
[01:03:49.801 --> 01:04:01.692]  Yes, if we could get him indicted or get him in deep trouble, that would then send a message to all these black ops and people, you're not going to get away with torture and murder of innocent people and warrantless wiretapping.
[01:04:01.692 --> 01:04:09.719]  But if it's just about blaming everything on Cheney and piling all the sins on him, he's just a high-level corporate functionary, a CEO type.
[01:04:11.553 --> 01:04:17.238]  And so if we act like all the evil emanated out of Cheney, it becomes a birdcage liner.
[01:04:17.238 --> 01:04:26.505]  I want to talk about the bird that's crapping all over us instead of, you know, Bill Clinton or Dick Cheney or Barack Obama, who are just birdcage liners.
[01:04:26.505 --> 01:04:28.967]  Instead of talking about the birdcage liner, I want to talk about the bird.
[01:04:28.967 --> 01:04:32.249]  David Rockefeller, Queen of England, the Rothschilds, all this scum.
[01:04:33.030 --> 01:04:34.130]  That's who I want to talk about.
[01:04:34.130 --> 01:04:35.151]  I want to bring them to justice.
[01:04:35.151 --> 01:04:36.491]  I want them to get in trouble.
[01:04:36.491 --> 01:04:40.593]  And it's talking about these guys that need to get in trouble is what will actually send hit squads out.
[01:04:40.593 --> 01:04:41.774]  But I don't care.
[01:04:41.774 --> 01:04:43.574]  Like I said, I'm going right at them.
[01:04:43.574 --> 01:04:45.335]  And yeah, the whole Cheney thing is very interesting.
[01:04:45.335 --> 01:04:52.778]  And it's important that it comes out because it shows what complete criminals the government is and how illegitimate they are.
[01:04:52.778 --> 01:04:54.639]  I think he would be a bigger hit otherwise.
[01:04:55.563 --> 01:04:56.284]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:04:56.284 --> 01:04:56.584]  I hear you.
[01:04:56.584 --> 01:04:57.466]  I appreciate your call.
[01:04:57.466 --> 01:04:59.769]  Good points there, David.
[01:04:59.769 --> 01:05:00.750]  We'll take more calls when we get back.
[01:05:00.750 --> 01:05:05.817]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator this summer.
[01:05:05.817 --> 01:05:09.842]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:05:09.842 --> 01:05:10.243]  Number two,
[01:05:10.523 --> 01:05:15.744]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:05:15.744 --> 01:05:16.384]  It's true.
[01:05:16.384 --> 01:05:20.805]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:05:20.805 --> 01:05:21.725]  Number 3.
[01:05:21.725 --> 01:05:27.347]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded, especially with the high demand summer months ahead.
[01:05:27.347 --> 01:05:28.007]  Number 4.
[01:05:28.007 --> 01:05:30.907]  The hurricane and dangerous summer storm season is here again.
[01:05:30.907 --> 01:05:34.568]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:05:34.568 --> 01:05:35.428]  Number 5.
[01:05:35.428 --> 01:05:39.049]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[01:05:39.289 --> 01:05:45.014]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, a longtime sponsor of ours.
[01:05:45.014 --> 01:05:49.718]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.

[01:06:02.308 --> 01:06:07.055]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[01:06:07.055 --> 01:06:10.019]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[01:06:10.019 --> 01:06:13.064]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[01:06:13.064 --> 01:06:16.689]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family.
[01:06:16.849 --> 01:06:22.374]  In any emergency, if you simply prepare, no one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[01:06:22.374 --> 01:06:29.360]  You know efoodsdirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.

[01:08:00.838 --> 01:08:06.261]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[01:08:06.261 --> 01:08:08.522]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:08:17.093 --> 01:08:32.524]  By the way, a point I've been meaning to make for months, this whole last session of Congress, especially in the House, we've been taping it all for the Obama film, going through all the video, all the different lies in the seat.
[01:08:32.524 --> 01:08:34.565]  It's unbelievable.
[01:08:34.565 --> 01:08:39.548]  And I've been watching Congress since high school.
[01:08:39.548 --> 01:08:42.810]  You know, we had cable and C-SPAN.
[01:08:42.810 --> 01:08:45.752]  I've been watching C-SPAN since I was about 14 years old.
[01:08:49.525 --> 01:08:53.687]  So that's a while.
[01:08:53.687 --> 01:08:59.970]  And I guess more than 20 years.
[01:08:59.970 --> 01:09:01.711]  So I know a little bit about the procedure.
[01:09:01.711 --> 01:09:03.072]  It's very Byzantine.
[01:09:03.072 --> 01:09:05.093]  They're always changing house rules.
[01:09:05.093 --> 01:09:07.194]  But I know the basics.
[01:09:07.194 --> 01:09:09.415]  More than most.
[01:09:09.415 --> 01:09:16.718]  And the Democrats, and I've watched Republican and Democrat alike, have never acted like this.
[01:09:16.718 --> 01:09:17.479]  Neither party has.
[01:09:19.158 --> 01:09:23.302]  The Democrats are breaking all the rules.
[01:09:23.302 --> 01:09:25.544]  They are engaging in fake votes.
[01:09:25.544 --> 01:09:26.425]  They are cheating.
[01:09:26.425 --> 01:09:28.407]  They are voting more than once.
[01:09:28.407 --> 01:09:30.069]  They are not letting people see bills.
[01:09:30.069 --> 01:09:35.554]  I mean, in the past, they would release a bill an hour or two before.
[01:09:35.554 --> 01:09:43.782]  Now, they put one copy out and say, we're calling the vote, and then the leader of the Republicans has to get up and do a House filibuster just to be able to read it.
[01:09:45.441 --> 01:09:47.643]  He gets up and says, OK, I just got this five minutes ago.
[01:09:47.643 --> 01:09:50.807]  I'm blocking the vote.
[01:09:50.807 --> 01:09:53.990]  I'm just going to stay up here and talk.
[01:09:53.990 --> 01:09:58.395]  And there's not really a filibuster in the House unless you're a leader, but then you can have an unlimited filibuster.
[01:09:58.395 --> 01:10:07.425]  But I was just in there during the break in the coffee room, drinking from the coffee pot, my last vice.
[01:10:11.943 --> 01:10:14.564]  Like a bear climbing into a honey bottle.
[01:10:14.564 --> 01:10:15.164]  Honey jar.
[01:10:15.164 --> 01:10:37.231]  But the point is, I'm in there watching it, and they had just a big vote, there's all this booing and yelling, and they're just ignoring all the procedures, and the vote had been voted down, and then they opened it back up for a vote, which you're not supposed to be able to do, and then... It looks like there's more votes for it than there are actual Democrats, but they can't find Republicans that voted for it.
[01:10:37.231 --> 01:10:40.412]  There's this big fight going on, and I had to come back in here on air.
[01:10:40.412 --> 01:10:41.352]  But the issue is,
[01:10:44.238 --> 01:10:48.141]  That they say to the speaker, I would like to see the bill.
[01:10:48.141 --> 01:10:49.121]  And they go, you may see the bill.
[01:10:49.121 --> 01:10:50.042]  And they go, where is it?
[01:10:50.042 --> 01:10:50.742]  I will not tell you.
[01:10:50.742 --> 01:10:58.288]  I mean, I had this on video from back during the climate carbon tax bill they passed a week and a half ago.
[01:10:58.288 --> 01:10:59.348]  And they say, I can't see it.
[01:10:59.348 --> 01:11:02.570]  And they go, you may see it.
[01:11:02.570 --> 01:11:03.851]  And they go, but it's not here.
[01:11:03.851 --> 01:11:05.272]  They go, where is it?
[01:11:05.272 --> 01:11:08.494]  I will not tell you.
[01:11:08.494 --> 01:11:09.635]  And then they just laugh at them.
[01:11:09.635 --> 01:11:10.516]  I mean, it's just,
[01:11:12.250 --> 01:11:14.931]  Ladies and gentlemen, they've given the politicians the orders.
[01:11:14.931 --> 01:11:16.171]  Go for broke.
[01:11:16.171 --> 01:11:22.912]  Rob everybody, steal everything, including the kitchen sink and whatever's nailed down.
[01:11:22.912 --> 01:11:23.632]  Go for broke.
[01:11:23.632 --> 01:11:25.393]  There's not going to be anything left.
[01:11:25.393 --> 01:11:27.033]  Get enough money for your own private island.
[01:11:27.033 --> 01:11:28.433]  We're bringing America down.
[01:11:28.433 --> 01:11:30.454]  I mean, they are taking over, getting rid of the borders.
[01:11:30.454 --> 01:11:31.914]  They are taking over health care.
[01:11:31.914 --> 01:11:33.555]  They're passing all sorts of new taxes.
[01:11:33.555 --> 01:11:35.955]  They're saying they're going to raise taxes on everybody.
[01:11:35.955 --> 01:11:36.895]  Breaking that pledge.
[01:11:36.895 --> 01:11:39.816]  Obama's people saying he never pledged that, even though we have literally
[01:11:40.913 --> 01:11:47.741]  I don't know, I stopped at 20 plus videos of him saying, I pledge not one tax will be raised above $250,000 a year in a two-person family.
[01:11:47.741 --> 01:11:48.382]  Over $125,000 a year individual.
[01:11:48.382 --> 01:11:50.064]  And now he's saying, I never said that.
[01:11:55.273 --> 01:12:03.580]  I mean, it's just, you think Bill Clinton's bad, you think George Bush is bad, and I've had a lot of expert guests on who I agree with.
[01:12:03.580 --> 01:12:06.403]  It's not even that Obama's much worse than them.
[01:12:06.403 --> 01:12:11.107]  It's that we're further down in the progression of this tyranny.
[01:12:11.107 --> 01:12:11.947]  And they are...
[01:12:12.918 --> 01:12:31.870]  It's kind of like if you've already robbed four or five banks, you've already shot a security guard, and then shot a cop, and shot a teller, and you've already got a death sentence hanging over your head, you know you're going to the electric chair, you know you're going to the lethal injection, and you might as well just rob, steal, kill, do whatever you want.
[01:12:31.870 --> 01:12:34.592]  I mean, kill one cop, kill five cops.
[01:12:34.592 --> 01:12:39.555]  You know, it's just go for broke, wild, steal everything, do whatever you want,
[01:12:41.991 --> 01:12:45.933]  And that's why they're defending corrupt cops now that kill innocent people.
[01:12:45.933 --> 01:12:48.975]  And they're defending corrupt politicians that get caught doing bad things.
[01:12:48.975 --> 01:12:50.856]  I mean, it's open season, folks.
[01:12:50.856 --> 01:12:52.798]  Open season is the word.
[01:12:52.798 --> 01:12:58.341]  Open season on our Republic, on our freedoms, and just a gang of criminals are robbing everything.
[01:12:58.341 --> 01:13:05.546]  And you do see a few good congressmen on the independent side, on the Republican side, and a few even on the Democrat.
[01:13:05.546 --> 01:13:09.368]  You know, even Consentage Consultant says, you know, you're not following procedures, this is wrong.
[01:13:13.524 --> 01:13:17.271]  There's one independent senator who's telling the truth and doing a good job.
[01:13:17.271 --> 01:13:20.677]  And there's a few Republicans.
[01:13:20.677 --> 01:13:22.481]  There's a Republican congressman I want to get on.
[01:13:22.481 --> 01:13:23.943]  I'm really getting impressed with from Texas.
[01:13:27.128 --> 01:13:39.197]  Louis something, I keep pronouncing his name wrong, I've got to see it on screen to get it right, but he's always there fighting the bills and always right up front just being told to sit down and shut up by the pawn scum.
[01:13:39.197 --> 01:13:44.141]  You know, they're always rotating different Democrats through the speakership position.
[01:13:44.141 --> 01:13:49.886]  And there's always these evil lawyers up there advising them on how to twist and manipulate.
[01:13:49.886 --> 01:13:54.149]  And I just want you to know that we're being gang raped right now politically.
[01:13:57.407 --> 01:14:04.652]  And I have watched the Congress for twenty-plus years.
[01:14:04.652 --> 01:14:07.875]  It's twenty-one, twenty-two years.
[01:14:07.875 --> 01:14:08.995]  And I've never seen it.
[01:14:08.995 --> 01:14:11.877]  It looks like Parliament where they're yelling and screaming and fighting.
[01:14:11.877 --> 01:14:14.980]  Parliament wasn't like that until about a hundred years ago.
[01:14:14.980 --> 01:14:16.701]  All decorum is gone.
[01:14:16.701 --> 01:14:23.166]  It's like South Korean Parliament where they beat each other with canes on TV and choke each other on the Japanese diet sometimes when
[01:14:23.871 --> 01:14:27.633]  You know, half those guys are in the Japanese mafia with tats all over them.
[01:14:27.633 --> 01:14:31.275]  You just can't see it under their clothes and they start trying to kill each other in there.
[01:14:31.275 --> 01:14:33.737]  I mean, you know, that's basically what it's becoming.
[01:14:33.737 --> 01:14:36.858]  And you've just got these criminals up there and they don't care.
[01:14:36.858 --> 01:14:41.201]  They're just laughing and joking and it's so funny.
[01:14:41.201 --> 01:14:49.826]  And they've got more than 20 anti-gun bills, each one of them totally devastating, worse than anything ever introduced or passed before.
[01:14:53.655 --> 01:14:58.380]  I mean, it is heavy.
[01:14:58.380 --> 01:15:04.586]  It is heavy duty.
[01:15:04.586 --> 01:15:07.849]  I said I'd take calls, we'll just go to them.
[01:15:07.849 --> 01:15:11.913]  But just know this, this is the Alamo, and the neural order is coming over the walls.
[01:15:13.994 --> 01:15:24.017]  And the average American's got the thumb in their mouth or somewhere else and they just don't even want to hear what's going on and just think it's all a big party.
[01:15:24.017 --> 01:15:29.979]  As most people I know are losing their jobs or getting pay cuts, society is unraveling at the edges.
[01:15:32.932 --> 01:15:37.495]  The federal government's trying to make veterans pay for their own health care now?
[01:15:37.495 --> 01:15:39.977]  When they signed a contract and were promised that?
[01:15:39.977 --> 01:15:52.586]  And then when we first started covering that bill, listeners, we break a lot of news because listeners send us tips and things, and before the VFW came out and said it was criminal and before it was on the news, a few weeks before, our listeners called and said, have you seen this?
[01:15:52.586 --> 01:15:56.169]  They're proposing making vets pay for their own health care.
[01:15:57.048 --> 01:16:11.738]  And years ago I'd cover how they make vets pay for their own airline tickets back, they make them pay for their own meals at military bases in Germany, when they've got their legs blown off, and I would get neocons calling up threatening my office and emailing me saying, you're a liar.
[01:16:11.738 --> 01:16:20.364]  Because see, that was under George Bush, so it was unpatriotic to say that the troops shouldn't have to pay for their own meals or pay for their own medical care.
[01:16:20.364 --> 01:16:23.446]  It's already going on, so why not just totally get rid of it?
[01:16:26.653 --> 01:16:32.537]  I mean, this is just a total raping!
[01:16:32.537 --> 01:16:34.479]  They don't care about you!
[01:16:34.479 --> 01:16:39.282]  Get that through your heads, folks!
[01:16:39.282 --> 01:16:41.384]  Ilya in New York, you're on the air, go ahead.
[01:16:41.384 --> 01:16:44.426]  Hi Alex, how are you?
[01:16:44.426 --> 01:16:46.368]  Good.
[01:16:46.368 --> 01:16:55.014]  Anyways, I've been trying to petition the government about parking tickets because all they say, I live in New York,
[01:16:55.461 --> 01:16:59.664]  All they say is that they need to receive a response within 30 days.
[01:16:59.664 --> 01:17:04.267]  And I didn't see any obligation that I had passed that.
[01:17:04.267 --> 01:17:06.569]  So these administrative law judges...
[01:17:07.205 --> 01:17:09.347]  I still believe that you owe them any money.
[01:17:09.347 --> 01:17:11.829]  They won't let you have a trial.
[01:17:11.829 --> 01:17:15.652]  They won't give you what the Bill of Rights says you're due.
[01:17:15.652 --> 01:17:17.053]  And then they still charge you the money.
[01:17:17.053 --> 01:17:18.634]  And it's come out in New York.
[01:17:18.634 --> 01:17:21.296]  They give people tickets even when they're parked correctly.
[01:17:21.296 --> 01:17:23.037]  And they've been ordered.
[01:17:23.037 --> 01:17:27.320]  The police put together a full page ad and apologized and said, look, we've been ordered to squeeze you.
[01:17:27.320 --> 01:17:28.902]  This was three years ago.
[01:17:28.902 --> 01:17:33.805]  And we don't like doing this, but we've been ordered to really squeeze you.
[01:17:33.805 --> 01:17:35.647]  And absolutely, go ahead.
[01:17:37.373 --> 01:17:42.957]  So I kept writing them letters saying, uh, please give me a jury trial or dismiss these tickets.
[01:17:42.957 --> 01:17:52.223]  Uh, but they don't really listen and they don't even, uh, send me any lawful contract that, apparently, that they, they might think that I signed with them, which is no contract.
[01:17:52.223 --> 01:18:00.369]  I didn't sign any contract with them, but if there was, I would like a copy of it, or I would like a jury trial because it's, uh, controversial, over $20.
[01:18:00.369 --> 01:18:02.991]  I told Administrative Law Judge yesterday,
[01:18:03.453 --> 01:18:08.738]  She said that it's not necessary for administrative proceedings to have a jury trial.
[01:18:08.738 --> 01:18:09.398]  Yeah, that's right.
[01:18:09.398 --> 01:18:18.446]  And then this sounds small, but once they do that, they can then, without a trial, take anything else they want, and that's now happening in Austin.
[01:18:18.446 --> 01:18:21.469]  I appreciate your call, sir.
[01:18:21.469 --> 01:18:26.113]  Yeah, I was driving down the road last night and I heard the local NewsRadio 590 covering this.
[01:18:27.475 --> 01:18:30.797]  So I got home and I Googled it and sure enough, I forgot to bring that.
[01:18:30.797 --> 01:18:32.298]  I told you I left my stack at home.
[01:18:32.298 --> 01:18:33.839]  I forget the exact headline.
[01:18:33.839 --> 01:18:40.463]  It's schools taking, Austin schools charging fine for cell phones.
[01:18:40.463 --> 01:18:44.585]  There's no judge, no jury, no sworn peace officer, nothing.
[01:18:44.585 --> 01:18:52.730]  If you have a cell phone, even if it's off, they take your cell phone and then make you pay $15 each time to get it back and it's administrative.
[01:18:53.729 --> 01:19:08.473]  Just like there's no law you gotta take shots, but they say, we're gonna arrest you if you don't take shots, then they do an administrative procedure, they expel you falsely, then they trigger criminal proceedings for truancy, when they falsely kicked you out to trigger the truancy.
[01:19:08.473 --> 01:19:09.873]  See how the little lawyer scam works?
[01:19:09.873 --> 01:19:16.355]  We tried to explain that to some Prozac, Ritalin head, fluoride head person, and they just can't understand it.
[01:19:16.355 --> 01:19:18.996]  Now, it's the same thing here.
[01:19:18.996 --> 01:19:23.277]  In Austin, and now I learned searching all over the country, they're doing this,
[01:19:24.679 --> 01:19:26.941]  Different locales.
[01:19:26.941 --> 01:19:28.602]  No judge, no jury, no nothing.
[01:19:28.602 --> 01:19:37.228]  I mean, it'd be one thing if they said, you're going to get sent to the principal's office and you're disregarding policy and the third time you do it, you're going to get expelled.
[01:19:37.228 --> 01:19:38.389]  But no.
[01:19:38.389 --> 01:19:40.551]  They just want the money.
[01:19:40.551 --> 01:19:50.798]  And so, they steal your cell phone, and then raise money off of it, and then some kids don't have the money, so they just keep the cell phones and sell them.
[01:19:50.798 --> 01:19:52.460]  That was the other issue, is that
[01:19:55.325 --> 01:19:56.746]  It's just totally criminal.
[01:19:56.746 --> 01:20:00.849]  And that's what tyranny's all about.
[01:20:00.849 --> 01:20:07.773]  If you'd like to quit smoking regular cigarettes and try a revolutionary new alternative, this might be the most important message you will ever hear.
[01:20:07.773 --> 01:20:11.215]  PremiumeCigarette.com brings you the electronic cigarette.
[01:20:11.215 --> 01:20:12.576]  It looks like a cigarette.
[01:20:12.576 --> 01:20:14.758]  It feels and tastes like a cigarette.
[01:20:14.758 --> 01:20:16.999]  And even delivers nicotine like a cigarette.
[01:20:16.999 --> 01:20:22.943]  But because this is not a cigarette, it doesn't deliver toxic chemicals and tar into your lungs or discolor your teeth.
[01:20:25.598 --> 01:20:25.898]  I think?
[01:20:56.758 --> 01:21:04.440]  Are you wondering about your retirement portfolio?

[01:21:50.737 --> 01:21:51.677]  It is a big idea.
[01:21:51.677 --> 01:21:52.218]  A new world order.
[01:21:52.218 --> 01:21:52.638]  In the near future.
[01:22:06.770 --> 01:22:09.851]  Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[01:22:09.851 --> 01:22:12.673]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[01:22:12.673 --> 01:22:15.454]  Don't their objective be world domination?
[01:22:15.454 --> 01:22:18.655]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[01:22:18.655 --> 01:22:29.000]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:33.922]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[01:22:34.443 --> 01:22:38.304]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[01:22:38.304 --> 01:22:40.865]  Bill Burgess is making great progress toward a world government.
[01:22:40.865 --> 01:22:42.025]  Most people have no idea.
[01:22:42.025 --> 01:22:42.826]  They're not after money.
[01:22:42.826 --> 01:22:44.106]  They have all the money they need.
[01:22:44.106 --> 01:22:45.066]  They're after power.
[01:22:45.066 --> 01:22:46.227]  That's their aphrodisiac.

[01:22:57.751 --> 01:22:58.811]  You have been warned.
[01:22:59.608 --> 01:23:02.389]  The phone rings and the questions are asked.
[01:23:02.389 --> 01:23:03.629]  I've been so sick.
[01:23:03.629 --> 01:23:05.309]  Will the life change tea help me?
[01:23:05.309 --> 01:23:07.170]  Our answer is always the same.

[01:23:19.193 --> 01:23:23.694]  Many companies use gimmicks and misleading free trials for their campaign.
[01:23:23.694 --> 01:23:24.654]  We use results.
[01:23:25.094 --> 01:23:29.858]  Life Change Tease formula created by a PhD has been around for over 20 years.
[01:23:29.858 --> 01:23:34.482]  There are things happening in the world that are unseen and not healthy.
[01:23:34.482 --> 01:23:38.345]  The public has reached its all-time record for chronic sickness.
[01:23:38.345 --> 01:23:42.248]  This atrocity won't change unless you call us right now.

[01:24:19.513 --> 01:24:21.514]  Central Standard Time.
[01:24:21.514 --> 01:24:26.957]  We're here live, hitting the globalists and hitting them hard, thanks to you.
[01:24:26.957 --> 01:24:32.660]  Spreading the word, taking action, speaking the truth.
[01:24:32.660 --> 01:24:38.363]  You know, I say I get frustrated constantly, it's because I'm carrying around thousands of pieces of new data every week.
[01:24:38.363 --> 01:24:39.184]  That's how much I scan.
[01:24:43.431 --> 01:24:44.872]  Oh, I love that music.
[01:24:44.872 --> 01:24:45.852]  Let's crank it up for a second.
[01:24:45.852 --> 01:24:48.953]  I have a little bit of enjoyment here.
[01:24:48.953 --> 01:24:53.534]  Deep purple, baby!
[01:25:15.609 --> 01:25:21.552]  Yeah!
[01:25:21.552 --> 01:25:36.100]  Alright, let me try to finish up with this and start getting to your calls.
[01:25:36.100 --> 01:25:40.643]  The issue is that, um... I get...
[01:25:44.602 --> 01:25:53.911]  I'm frustrated because there is so much news and there's not time to really flesh out each story, each article, and properly put it in context, so I just don't get to most of it.
[01:25:53.911 --> 01:25:57.094]  I mean, I've just got news here, stack after stack, that's off the chart.
[01:25:57.094 --> 01:26:00.837]  It's all up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:26:00.837 --> 01:26:05.662]  But the guys searched the story that I found yesterday, and here it is.
[01:26:05.662 --> 01:26:08.645]  Cell phone fines mean big bucks for some Texas school districts.
[01:26:10.877 --> 01:26:13.899]  And it says in Austin, no judge, no jury, no due process.
[01:26:13.899 --> 01:26:18.622]  They just snatch and steal your property and they get $15 each time.
[01:26:18.622 --> 01:26:28.189]  And it says that Austin collected over $100,000 in two years.
[01:26:28.189 --> 01:26:30.811]  Houston collected hundreds of thousands.
[01:26:30.811 --> 01:26:32.652]  One high school got $17,000 in one year alone.
[01:26:37.608 --> 01:26:40.071]  And it talks about how smaller ISDs are doing it.
[01:26:40.071 --> 01:26:46.758]  Montgomery ISD took in 2,500.
[01:26:46.758 --> 01:26:48.440]  Magnolia ISD is doing it.
[01:26:48.440 --> 01:26:51.984]  I mean, this is millions.
[01:26:51.984 --> 01:26:54.768]  And the children are learning because
[01:26:56.564 --> 01:26:58.585]  They end up taking their cell phone to school.
[01:26:58.585 --> 01:27:01.807]  Some schools allow, but then if you have it out at lunch, then they take it because they want it.
[01:27:01.807 --> 01:27:07.910]  It's kind of like if the cops put too many speed traps up on the same road too long, they stop getting a catch.
[01:27:07.910 --> 01:27:08.910]  They move to other spots.
[01:27:08.910 --> 01:27:12.112]  They kind of want you speeding, you know, because they got to get the money.
[01:27:12.112 --> 01:27:17.755]  Well, at least there you can challenge it in court or you can, you know, demand due process.
[01:27:17.755 --> 01:27:19.215]  This is the end of America.
[01:27:19.215 --> 01:27:24.018]  I mean, you take the Texas comptroller.
[01:27:25.106 --> 01:27:26.267]  No judge, no jury.
[01:27:26.267 --> 01:27:28.648]  She just says she thinks you didn't pay enough sales tax.
[01:27:28.648 --> 01:27:30.129]  They just grab it out of your account.
[01:27:30.129 --> 01:27:31.670]  No judge, no jury, no recourse.
[01:27:31.670 --> 01:27:37.334]  I mean, we live under tyranny, ladies and gentlemen, and...
[01:27:40.600 --> 01:27:52.546]  All the time, executive branches of state and federal government, and now international government, they'll just slap taxes without even a law being passed on cell phones, or power, or boats, or cars.
[01:27:52.546 --> 01:27:58.209]  I mean, there's thousands of taxes now, and you just don't notice because it's all in the contract when you buy something.
[01:27:58.209 --> 01:28:00.610]  A lot of them, they tag on to industries.
[01:28:00.610 --> 01:28:06.973]  Oh, a lot of states have a golfing tax, or they have a lawnmower tax, or they have a... And that's what this carbon tax is all about.
[01:28:08.672 --> 01:28:11.574]  It's just total control where they can selectively enforce.
[01:28:11.574 --> 01:28:14.816]  Thirty-plus federal agencies can levy taxes by themselves.
[01:28:14.816 --> 01:28:29.846]  The law just gives them an imperial power, kind of like a letter of Mark, where the Queen of England would tell a captain, alright, you can take your five ships out, and you can rob this country's ships, that country's ships, and this country's ships, and I won't say you're a pirate.
[01:28:30.706 --> 01:28:37.550]  Sometimes the British and French governments, when they really needed money, they'd just say, rob anybody you want, except for our flags.
[01:28:37.550 --> 01:28:39.351]  You can even rob our allies.
[01:28:39.351 --> 01:28:41.452]  There were some cases of that.
[01:28:41.452 --> 01:28:54.379]  So a pirate pulls up, robs everything he got, and takes half the booty, and gives it to the Admiralty.
[01:28:54.379 --> 01:28:57.081]  And the Admiralty takes half for themselves and gives the rest to the Crown.
[01:28:58.228 --> 01:29:03.151]  Oh yes, being an admiral had its fringe benefits.
[01:29:03.151 --> 01:29:07.414]  I mean, some admirals became lords and had millions of pounds.
[01:29:07.414 --> 01:29:12.118]  And I mean millions of pounds in pounds hundreds of years ago, meaning physical.
[01:29:12.118 --> 01:29:16.320]  Giant storehouses full of silver and gold.
[01:29:16.320 --> 01:29:18.142]  Robbed from the planet.
[01:29:18.142 --> 01:29:23.826]  These are pirates we're dealing with and you don't think they won't stage a terror attack and kill 3,000 people to get their hold of Jennifer?
[01:29:25.006 --> 01:29:30.991]  You are thinking like a fool if you don't know history.
[01:29:30.991 --> 01:29:32.832]  All right, I'm going to continue with your phone calls on the other side.
[01:29:32.832 --> 01:29:38.036]  I'm going to go through this key analysis breakdown and a whole host of issues about my philosophy and where I see the world going.
[01:29:38.036 --> 01:29:43.861]  On the other side, I'm wound up and focused today, ladies and gentlemen, and I'm honored to be your host.
[01:29:43.861 --> 01:29:47.944]  I'm honored to be here with you, right here on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:47.944 --> 01:29:51.026]  PrisonPlanet.tv, check it out today.
[01:29:51.026 --> 01:29:52.428]  We're on the march.
[01:29:52.428 --> 01:29:53.929]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:54.930 --> 01:30:00.474]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:00.474 --> 01:30:04.718]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones and I want each of you to ask yourself this question.
[01:30:04.718 --> 01:30:06.719]  Do you really know what's in your tap water?
[01:30:06.719 --> 01:30:15.245]  In a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor, they found that over 260 chemicals and pollutants are present in municipal drinking water.
[01:30:15.245 --> 01:30:20.790]  Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive, immune, and developmental system diseases.
[01:30:20.790 --> 01:30:22.411]  Now what are you going to do about it?
[01:30:22.651 --> 01:30:29.157]  The Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator is a low-cost way to take back control of you and your family's drinking water.
[01:30:29.157 --> 01:30:40.228]  The Ecola Blue 28 produces up to 7 gallons of water from the humidity in the atmosphere, and uses state-of-the-art carbon filtration, reverse osmosis, and ultra-violent light sterilization techniques.
[01:30:40.228 --> 01:30:40.988]  That's right.
[01:30:40.988 --> 01:30:43.571]  Clean water, right from the air you breathe.

[01:31:00.472 --> 01:31:06.335]  This is Alex Jones, and I want to tell you again about a company that has supported us and the Truth Movement for years.
[01:31:06.335 --> 01:31:07.635]  Inner Health Botanicals.
[01:31:07.635 --> 01:31:11.897]  This company produces the highest quality superfood around, called Inner Food.
[01:31:11.897 --> 01:31:13.758]  My wife just loves the stuff.

[01:31:25.823 --> 01:31:28.823]  It would be impossible to blend this up for a better price.
[01:31:28.823 --> 01:31:30.544]  And their formula really works.
[01:31:30.544 --> 01:31:33.365]  This is the real thing for the great health you need.
[01:31:33.365 --> 01:31:34.845]  Try the NutriCafe.
[01:31:34.845 --> 01:31:39.607]  Their great organic coffee infused with polysaccharides that boost the immune system.
[01:31:39.607 --> 01:31:42.028]  A truly healthy coffee that tastes great.
[01:31:42.028 --> 01:31:44.489]  And take it from me folks, it really does taste great.
[01:31:44.489 --> 01:31:46.589]  Don't forget to try their other great products.
[01:31:46.589 --> 01:31:48.890]  Go to www.interfood.com
[01:31:49.611 --> 01:31:51.936]  We're good to go.
[01:32:00.560 --> 01:32:05.523]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator this summer.
[01:32:30.660 --> 01:32:31.240]  We're good.
[01:33:19.159 --> 01:33:22.000]  All right, let's go to your phone calls here.
[01:33:22.000 --> 01:33:23.721]  Jerry in Indiana, you're on the air.
[01:33:23.721 --> 01:33:26.382]  Thanks for holding.
[01:33:26.382 --> 01:33:27.402]  Hi, Alex.
[01:33:27.402 --> 01:33:28.723]  Hey, Jerry.
[01:33:28.723 --> 01:33:30.783]  Hey, I appreciate your videos.
[01:33:30.783 --> 01:33:33.544]  These are excellent, professionally done.
[01:33:33.544 --> 01:33:43.588]  I am a loner, hermit-type person, but I bought these videos and got them out to my circle of people.
[01:33:43.588 --> 01:33:46.669]  And I have a waiting list to see them now.
[01:33:46.669 --> 01:33:48.250]  And the thing is, for these listeners,
[01:33:49.033 --> 01:34:00.978]  I've been a shortwave listener for 35 years now, and the thing of it is, the people that are receptive to these videos, get them out.
[01:34:00.978 --> 01:34:03.779]  The ones that are not, go on.
[01:34:03.779 --> 01:34:04.799]  It's a numbers game.
[01:34:04.799 --> 01:34:08.481]  We've got to stand for liberty.
[01:34:08.481 --> 01:34:14.483]  And I appreciate you clinging to Psalms 94-16, Alex.
[01:34:14.483 --> 01:34:16.224]  It makes me proud to talk to you.
[01:34:19.932 --> 01:34:26.556]  The other thing, I had a woman came over in my little circle and said, well, I don't believe about eugenics.
[01:34:26.556 --> 01:34:27.216]  You don't believe?
[01:34:27.216 --> 01:34:29.998]  She said, I don't believe in eugenics.
[01:34:29.998 --> 01:34:32.519]  So I backed it up to the Georgia Guidestones.
[01:34:32.519 --> 01:34:42.505]  People, the information that Alex Jones has on these videos is damning to the New World Order.
[01:34:42.505 --> 01:34:43.566]  Jim Guy Tucker.
[01:34:44.753 --> 01:34:50.996]  I listened to 30 years ago when he was just going out after Bilderberg, Webster Tarpley.
[01:34:50.996 --> 01:34:56.819]  These are credible individuals that are in these videos.
[01:34:56.819 --> 01:34:58.680]  Like I said, I'm not a speaker.
[01:34:58.680 --> 01:35:02.922]  Alex Jones didn't call me and tell me to promote his show.
[01:35:02.922 --> 01:35:07.344]  I am doing it because he stands for liberty.
[01:35:07.344 --> 01:35:09.645]  We must take this country back.
[01:35:12.884 --> 01:35:18.512]  You know, I would rather die on my feet than be a slave on my knees.
[01:35:18.512 --> 01:35:26.002]  You've got to burn what it did for me watching these videos of the stinking of our forefathers, Alex.
[01:35:26.002 --> 01:35:30.668]  What they went through to save this republic.
[01:35:31.892 --> 01:35:34.675]  And you know, the establishment loves to attack the founding fathers.
[01:35:34.675 --> 01:35:37.237]  I was watching Keith Overman last night and he had a guest doing it.
[01:35:37.237 --> 01:35:38.659]  Think of the time they were in.
[01:35:38.659 --> 01:35:43.264]  They were the most truly progressive, the most truly liberal in the spirit of freedom.
[01:35:43.264 --> 01:35:45.526]  You know, real liberalness, not the establishment.
[01:35:45.526 --> 01:35:47.127]  Counterfeit of today.
[01:35:47.127 --> 01:35:49.210]  They were amazing intellectuals.
[01:35:49.870 --> 01:36:01.159]  On par, even greater minds than the best Greek philosophers, the greatest Greek philosophers, and this country for all the bad it's done has been the most special, has been the greatest engine.
[01:36:01.159 --> 01:36:11.347]  I mean, 4% of the world's population, we had half the wealth, then all the controllers and all the manipulators and all the charlatans came here to eat us out of house and home.
[01:36:11.347 --> 01:36:16.832]  They came here to carpetbag and to scallywag and they've done a great job of it and we just gotta
[01:36:17.594 --> 01:36:18.794]  Get rid of these criminals.
[01:36:18.794 --> 01:36:20.054]  We've got to get our spirit back.
[01:36:20.054 --> 01:36:27.996]  It's like when you've got a bad employee who's gotten out of control and somehow they've got you bamboozled and you've been intimidated for no reason to not stand up.
[01:36:27.996 --> 01:36:30.736]  As soon as you finally stand up, it feels great.
[01:36:30.736 --> 01:36:35.597]  And the government is our employee and it knows we're waking up, so it's trying to set up a police state right now.
[01:36:35.597 --> 01:36:40.158]  And we've got to point out to the police state enforcers, hey, you're getting enslaved too, Bubba.
[01:36:40.158 --> 01:36:41.538]  And they're starting to listen.
[01:36:41.538 --> 01:36:44.939]  So God bless you and I really appreciate your call from Indiana.
[01:36:44.939 --> 01:36:46.059]  Thanks for holding to say that.
[01:36:47.247 --> 01:36:51.288]  You know, the word cling is true.
[01:36:51.288 --> 01:36:53.089]  And every once in a while, the fear creeps in.
[01:36:53.089 --> 01:36:57.571]  Every once in a while, not even fear, it's like, God, I love looking at the blue sky.
[01:36:57.571 --> 01:36:59.912]  I love looking at my son and daughters.
[01:36:59.912 --> 01:37:01.632]  I love swimming with them.
[01:37:01.632 --> 01:37:02.513]  I love hiking.
[01:37:02.513 --> 01:37:06.414]  I love the smell of cut grass.
[01:37:06.414 --> 01:37:07.915]  There was a sprinkler on yesterday.
[01:37:07.915 --> 01:37:11.036]  I was out in the backyard playing with my children for about two hours.
[01:37:11.036 --> 01:37:11.976]  Two hours I spent with them.
[01:37:11.976 --> 01:37:13.056]  I tried to allot that time.
[01:37:13.056 --> 01:37:13.837]  I wish I could spend more.
[01:37:14.929 --> 01:37:19.452]  And the sprinkler, my son was watering plants and he dropped it, you know, kind of the hand sprayer.
[01:37:19.452 --> 01:37:22.294]  And it was like a sprinkler because it fell to the ground.
[01:37:22.294 --> 01:37:25.597]  I always tend to simplify stories and I go back and want to break it down.
[01:37:25.597 --> 01:37:32.462]  We're in the backyard and he's got the sprayer on the end of the hose and he's spraying some plants.
[01:37:32.462 --> 01:37:34.523]  It's not really watering them, but you know, kids like to water.
[01:37:34.523 --> 01:37:35.584]  He's having fun.
[01:37:35.584 --> 01:37:40.327]  And he drops it and runs off chasing the dog, throwing a ball.
[01:37:40.327 --> 01:37:40.828]  And, uh,
[01:37:42.139 --> 01:37:52.384]  So shooting up into an oak tree and shooting out into the sun, making a rainbow and the smell of the water and the ozone coming out of it.
[01:37:52.384 --> 01:37:53.325]  It was like heaven.
[01:37:53.325 --> 01:37:55.266]  And I just said, this is heaven.
[01:37:55.266 --> 01:37:57.987]  It's so simple.
[01:37:57.987 --> 01:38:00.429]  And then I think, man, I don't want them to kill me.
[01:38:00.429 --> 01:38:02.290]  I don't want to not be here for my kids.
[01:38:02.290 --> 01:38:07.072]  I don't want them to, or get put in prison or set up or lied about.
[01:38:07.072 --> 01:38:10.454]  And I just said, and you know, it's just God, you just take it, you just handle it.
[01:38:12.708 --> 01:38:17.653]  But also, when I pray, I say, God, don't protect me if that means it doesn't get my job done.
[01:38:17.653 --> 01:38:26.941]  You know, just whatever it takes, I'm here, I'm ready, and just protect my family.
[01:38:26.941 --> 01:38:29.764]  But if that's not in the plan, then don't.
[01:38:29.764 --> 01:38:31.806]  I'm not here telling God what to do.
[01:38:31.806 --> 01:38:38.352]  I'm saying, give me providence, give me leadership, give me guidance and direction, help me be strong.
[01:38:39.571 --> 01:38:52.561]  And half the time I get the spirit of frustration and not doing a good job, and I need to realize that no, I'm doing the best I can, and when I'm just calm and turned over to God, I'm so much more articulate, so much more focused, and that's the path to be on.
[01:38:52.561 --> 01:38:59.065]  Trust in God, but tie up your camel, as the Bedouins say, or trust in God, but row away from the rocks.
[01:38:59.065 --> 01:39:06.351]  Take action, get involved, and do the best you can, and then just say, I'm doing the best I can, Creator.
[01:39:06.351 --> 01:39:07.772]  Will you carry me the rest of the way?
[01:39:11.274 --> 01:39:14.216]  And that's what faith is, is that I'm going to do the best I can.
[01:39:14.216 --> 01:39:16.317]  I'm going to try to be the best person I can.
[01:39:16.317 --> 01:39:18.218]  I'm going to try to be a moral good person.
[01:39:18.218 --> 01:39:20.059]  I'm going to try to be humble.
[01:39:20.059 --> 01:39:23.301]  I'm going to try to not be too competitive with people or too worldly or too hateful.
[01:39:23.301 --> 01:39:26.082]  I mean, folks, I can just instantly froth into evil.
[01:39:26.082 --> 01:39:29.484]  I can just shift into it.
[01:39:29.484 --> 01:39:35.768]  But the more I deny the flesh, the more I lay it down and just try to be a good person and really try to be strong.
[01:39:36.881 --> 01:39:41.563]  It's just so humbling at the same time, and in the humbling, it makes you so strong.
[01:39:41.563 --> 01:39:47.585]  And then you see people that are into the flesh, into the world, and you feel sorry for them, even your enemies.
[01:39:47.585 --> 01:39:57.969]  I kind of shift into looking at Bill Gates, enjoying all his evil and all the eugenics, and I hate him, but at a certain level, I just look at how pathetic he is, and then I think, how can we be ruled by this guy?
[01:39:57.969 --> 01:39:59.789]  How can he be winning?
[01:39:59.789 --> 01:40:03.090]  It's only because good people have it stood up.
[01:40:03.090 --> 01:40:04.731]  If you lay down in a fight, you're gonna lose, folks.
[01:40:08.339 --> 01:40:14.402]  You know, the only times I got my butt kicked in fights were the few times that I was a little bit in the wrong.
[01:40:14.402 --> 01:40:21.867]  Any time I was a little bit in the wrong, any time I went ahead and let myself get in the fight fast, any time I went ahead and said, sure, you want some, those were the few times.
[01:40:21.867 --> 01:40:29.591]  But every time I was in the right, and every time that I was outnumbered, it just couldn't be stopped.
[01:40:29.591 --> 01:40:32.573]  And that's what it is in every facet of life, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:40:35.618 --> 01:40:46.242]  The times I was in the wrong, some little guy could kick my butt, but when I was in the right, I could sit there with four or five big, huge football players, 250 pounds, and just punch them each time, and they'd just lay right over.
[01:40:46.242 --> 01:40:48.482]  You know, just with bones cracking.
[01:40:48.482 --> 01:40:50.923]  Only problem was my fist would break.
[01:40:50.923 --> 01:40:52.184]  Bones would crack.
[01:40:52.184 --> 01:40:53.744]  And again, that's not tough guy talk.
[01:40:53.744 --> 01:40:54.804]  I'm saying you all know that.
[01:40:54.804 --> 01:40:56.145]  You've all experienced things like that.
[01:40:58.953 --> 01:41:01.174]  What's that Texas Ranger founders quote?
[01:41:01.174 --> 01:41:01.994]  Print that off.
[01:41:01.994 --> 01:41:03.215]  I forget the exact quote.
[01:41:03.215 --> 01:41:04.996]  It's great having the team in there.
[01:41:04.996 --> 01:41:06.857]  They just run the TV show mainly.
[01:41:06.857 --> 01:41:11.619]  Genesis runs the radio side so they can kind of sit there for it live at TV and print me all this stuff.
[01:41:11.619 --> 01:41:17.301]  About a man in the wrong can't keep on a coming against a man who's in the right.
[01:41:17.301 --> 01:41:20.463]  Or a man in the wrong can't stand up against a man in the right.
[01:41:20.463 --> 01:41:21.183]  Keeps on a coming.
[01:41:25.123 --> 01:41:28.284]  But when you are in the wrong, folks, you're weak.
[01:41:28.284 --> 01:41:29.525]  Well, you may win a few victories.
[01:41:29.525 --> 01:41:32.086]  You may be able to snipe at people, engage in evil.
[01:41:32.086 --> 01:41:34.487]  But you're not going to be fulfilled.
[01:41:34.487 --> 01:41:36.067]  You've got feet made of clay, folks.
[01:41:36.067 --> 01:41:41.809]  I want feet made of carbide steel.
[01:41:41.809 --> 01:41:46.951]  Yeah, this is the King James Bible, Psalms 23, and I do cling to it.
[01:41:46.951 --> 01:41:48.092]  Because this is real, folks.
[01:41:48.092 --> 01:41:48.992]  What I do is real.
[01:41:48.992 --> 01:41:50.413]  Our trials and tribulations are real.
[01:41:50.413 --> 01:41:51.333]  But it's all a blessing.
[01:41:52.418 --> 01:41:54.098]  The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want.
[01:41:54.098 --> 01:41:56.479]  He maketh me to lie down in green pastures.
[01:41:56.479 --> 01:41:58.419]  He leadeth me beside still waters.
[01:41:58.419 --> 01:42:00.259]  He restoreth my soul.
[01:42:00.259 --> 01:42:05.400]  He leadeth me in the path of righteousness for his name's sake.
[01:42:05.400 --> 01:42:12.401]  Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil, for thou art with me.
[01:42:12.401 --> 01:42:14.882]  Thy rod and thy staff, they comfort me.
[01:42:14.882 --> 01:42:16.942]  This is the most important part.
[01:42:16.942 --> 01:42:20.983]  Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of my enemies.
[01:42:22.011 --> 01:42:25.573]  Thou anointest my head with oil, my cup runneth over.
[01:42:25.573 --> 01:42:32.856]  Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life, and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever.
[01:42:32.856 --> 01:42:37.138]  I think that's probably the most beautiful part of the Bible.
[01:42:37.138 --> 01:42:40.499]  And that's why the enemy doesn't want you to read things like this.
[01:42:40.499 --> 01:42:43.601]  Even if you're not a Christian, that is beautiful, beautiful ideas.
[01:42:43.601 --> 01:42:47.602]  It says so much in such a short period of time.
[01:42:47.602 --> 01:42:48.483]  It buoys the soul.
[01:42:50.589 --> 01:42:52.489]  The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want.
[01:42:52.489 --> 01:42:55.110]  He maketh me to lie down in green pastures.
[01:42:55.110 --> 01:42:57.770]  Exactly like I was laying down in a green pasture.
[01:42:57.770 --> 01:43:04.592]  I just would lay there on the grass playing with my little 16-month-old girl.
[01:43:04.592 --> 01:43:07.892]  And the sun shining and the trees and the birds.
[01:43:07.892 --> 01:43:10.173]  He maketh me to lie down in green pastures.
[01:43:10.173 --> 01:43:15.434]  With all this evil going on around us, ladies and gentlemen, He maketh us to lie down in green pastures.
[01:43:17.113 --> 01:43:19.494]  He leadeth me beside still waters.
[01:43:19.494 --> 01:43:20.134]  Still waters.
[01:43:20.134 --> 01:43:22.355]  Ever walked beside a still waters?
[01:43:22.355 --> 01:43:29.199]  How it energizes the soul, because it reflects God's love in the universe through the holy water.
[01:43:29.199 --> 01:43:30.499]  He restoreth my soul.
[01:43:30.499 --> 01:43:34.341]  He leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake.
[01:43:34.341 --> 01:43:35.081]  He restoreth.
[01:43:35.081 --> 01:43:40.204]  See, whenever you're torn down, he builds you back up stronger each time you go through the flame.
[01:43:40.204 --> 01:43:41.284]  He restoreth my soul.
[01:43:41.284 --> 01:43:45.086]  He leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake.
[01:43:45.868 --> 01:43:49.170]  Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death.
[01:43:49.170 --> 01:43:50.431]  We are all in the shadow of death.
[01:43:50.431 --> 01:43:51.152]  We will all die.
[01:43:51.152 --> 01:43:53.733]  We will all take that final journey.
[01:43:53.733 --> 01:43:55.735]  I will fear no evil.
[01:43:55.735 --> 01:43:57.376]  He must conquer the fear.
[01:43:57.376 --> 01:44:00.318]  Through God, through creation, through love.
[01:44:00.318 --> 01:44:03.200]  I will fear no evil, for thou art with me.
[01:44:03.200 --> 01:44:04.581]  Creation is with you.
[01:44:04.581 --> 01:44:10.105]  The Creator, the Great Maker is with you.
[01:44:10.105 --> 01:44:13.307]  Thou preparest the table before me in the presence of mine enemies.
[01:44:15.154 --> 01:44:20.999]  See, that's another variation of no weapon formed against us shall prosper.
[01:44:20.999 --> 01:44:23.942]  I'll prepare us the table of forming the presence of my enemies.
[01:44:23.942 --> 01:44:29.327]  Thou anointest my head with oil, my cup runneth over.
[01:44:29.327 --> 01:44:34.912]  See, you're anointed with discernment and understanding.
[01:44:34.912 --> 01:44:39.436]  With great knowledge comes great pain, but also great love.
[01:44:42.455 --> 01:44:44.996]  Thou anointest my head with oil, my cup runneth over.
[01:44:44.996 --> 01:44:45.797]  The cup runneth over!
[01:44:45.797 --> 01:44:48.939]  I'm just so blessed in every way.
[01:44:48.939 --> 01:44:56.183]  Blessed with health and blessed with beauty and blessed with friends and blessed with family.
[01:44:56.183 --> 01:45:04.788]  Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever.
[01:45:04.788 --> 01:45:09.931]  And I'm just so blessed to have, in comparison to many, such a good, wholesome, strong family.
[01:45:11.291 --> 01:45:15.514]  And of course, liberty and freedom and love of God does run in families.
[01:45:15.514 --> 01:45:20.118]  It runs in all of you out there to different degrees and different gifts.
[01:45:20.118 --> 01:45:23.741]  And you have to realize that you will fail, you will fall, you will die.
[01:45:23.741 --> 01:45:29.946]  This body suit, this earth suit, is meant to decay.
[01:45:29.946 --> 01:45:40.435]  And in accepting that and loving that and enjoying that and enjoying the new life, you reach fulfillment.
[01:45:40.435 --> 01:45:40.835]  That's why
[01:45:42.520 --> 01:45:48.404]  When I was young, I never thought old people were ugly, and so many other people thought old people were ugly.
[01:45:48.404 --> 01:45:50.125]  Ooh, look at that old lady, look at that old man.
[01:45:50.125 --> 01:45:57.770]  And I, if they still had their soul, if they hadn't been destroyed by the world, there's great beauty in our elders.
[01:45:57.770 --> 01:46:03.493]  Just as there's beauty in a child, or beauty in a young woman or young man.
[01:46:03.493 --> 01:46:04.774]  The beauty of life.
[01:46:04.774 --> 01:46:09.377]  There's beauty in swallows or bluebirds that nest in my yard.
[01:46:13.240 --> 01:46:19.381]  Just as there's beauty in a grizzly bear, or the salmon that scoops out of the river.
[01:46:19.381 --> 01:46:25.262]  There's beauty in all things, as long as it's part of God's creation and God's order.
[01:46:25.262 --> 01:46:29.643]  And there is a time to live and a time to die.
[01:46:29.643 --> 01:46:32.964]  I know all these things are common sense, but do we think about them?
[01:46:32.964 --> 01:46:33.864]  Do we understand them?
[01:46:33.864 --> 01:46:40.385]  Do we understand that we're part of an endless chain, and that our ancestors lived through us right now?
[01:46:42.802 --> 01:46:49.805]  And that our progeny, and their progeny to come, that we live through them.
[01:46:49.805 --> 01:47:05.411]  All the blood of heroes, and tyrants, and good men, bad men, artists, musicians, blacksmiths, warriors, it all flows through your veins.
[01:47:05.411 --> 01:47:11.694]  No matter where you come from, what culture, what race of the human race, what variety, it's all there.
[01:47:11.694 --> 01:47:12.354]  That whole history.
[01:47:14.349 --> 01:47:24.916]  And all any of us really want to do is leave our mark in society and leave the world better than we found it when we came into it.
[01:47:24.916 --> 01:47:26.618]  We want to communicate with the future.
[01:47:26.618 --> 01:47:30.720]  We want to communicate with generations to come.
[01:47:30.720 --> 01:47:33.983]  Not just because we don't want to be forgotten, but because we love them.
[01:47:33.983 --> 01:47:35.864]  We love life.
[01:47:35.864 --> 01:47:39.987]  So in our literature, in our writings, in our music, in our films, in all we do,
[01:47:42.298 --> 01:47:44.819]  We send a message into the future.
[01:47:44.819 --> 01:47:48.801]  And all the evil of the past echoes with us today as well.
[01:47:48.801 --> 01:47:51.182]  But if you want to beat the New World Order, start loving yourself.
[01:47:51.182 --> 01:47:51.963]  Start loving your neighbors.
[01:47:51.963 --> 01:47:53.423]  Start loving your wife, your husband.
[01:47:53.423 --> 01:47:55.544]  Start loving the people around you.
[01:47:55.544 --> 01:47:59.226]  Forgive those that trespass against you.
[01:47:59.226 --> 01:48:00.747]  Just as we have trespassed against them.
[01:48:07.725 --> 01:48:17.010]  But there are the psychopaths completely given over to the dark side, completely consumed by evil.
[01:48:17.010 --> 01:48:20.352]  It runs in their families.
[01:48:20.352 --> 01:48:23.593]  And most of them fall.
[01:48:23.593 --> 01:48:29.356]  And they are our mortal enemies until the end.
[01:48:29.356 --> 01:48:31.377]  Let's talk to Mike in Wyoming.
[01:48:31.377 --> 01:48:32.058]  Mike, you're on the air.
[01:48:33.234 --> 01:48:49.579]  Alex, I had an idea the other day as I was listening to one of your horror stories about people who've been electrocuted or killed for just the most minor infractions or for nothing at all by city cops or sheriff's deputies.
[01:48:49.579 --> 01:49:00.503]  And I wish I had the time and expertise to do it myself, but if someone could just set up a website and call it something like DangerousCities.com that just
[01:49:01.072 --> 01:49:10.676]  You know, listed these towns and cities where these horror stories took place, and just a brief snippet about, you know, what exactly occurred there.
[01:49:10.676 --> 01:49:23.842]  And then, you know, then noticed the mayor and the Chamber of Commerce and said, you know, congratulations, you've made it to our list of, you know, most dangerous cities in the U.S.
[01:49:23.842 --> 01:49:26.123]  It's a genius idea, and you've been calling for 10 years.
[01:49:26.123 --> 01:49:27.124]  You're a medical doctor.
[01:49:27.124 --> 01:49:29.885]  It'd be great to have a medical doctor do a site like that.
[01:49:31.334 --> 01:49:47.714]  Yeah, like I said, I used to be a computer programmer too, but those days are long gone and I'd be happy to contribute to the upkeep of such a site, but I don't have the ability to set it up myself.
[01:49:47.714 --> 01:49:50.418]  But if one of your listeners might run with it.
[01:49:53.115 --> 01:49:53.876]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:49:53.876 --> 01:50:00.241]  We've given an email out before for a free DVD and had like 300 emails in 5 seconds wanting it.
[01:50:00.241 --> 01:50:00.921]  300 plus.
[01:50:00.921 --> 01:50:06.906]  So, I'm sure people have already gone out and tried to get Dangerous Cities, but we just got something else.
[01:50:06.906 --> 01:50:07.466]  What did we just get?
[01:50:07.466 --> 01:50:10.529]  Oh, you guys are doing high fives in there.
[01:50:10.529 --> 01:50:11.269]  Okay.
[01:50:11.269 --> 01:50:12.830]  They thought of another great name.
[01:50:12.830 --> 01:50:13.871]  Absolutely.
[01:50:13.871 --> 01:50:15.833]  Mike, what do you think about the whole state of the world?
[01:50:15.833 --> 01:50:19.936]  I mean, we've been expecting all of this, but it's really hard for me to even believe it's happening.
[01:50:21.570 --> 01:50:22.551]  Yeah, it is.
[01:50:22.551 --> 01:50:29.635]  And most people in my little corner of the world here are still in denial.
[01:50:29.635 --> 01:50:32.917]  You know, there's a gradual awakening occurring, I think.
[01:50:32.917 --> 01:50:39.542]  And, you know, I write op-eds every six weeks, as often as I'm permitted to, about a local paper.
[01:50:39.542 --> 01:50:41.903]  And they give me a lot of latitude.
[01:50:41.903 --> 01:50:43.324]  You know, my last piece was 700 words.
[01:50:44.847 --> 01:50:47.571]  Hey, Mike, you ought to write those for us and also publish them there.
[01:50:47.571 --> 01:50:49.855]  Writers at InfoWars.com.
[01:50:49.855 --> 01:50:50.355]  Stay there, Mike.
[01:50:50.355 --> 01:50:51.597]  I want you to finish up the other side.
[01:50:51.597 --> 01:50:54.502]  Then we'll go to Jason, Kay, Ronnie, and others.
[01:50:54.502 --> 01:50:57.766]  And then, Wayne Paul, brother of Congressman Ron Paul.
[01:50:57.766 --> 01:50:58.588]  Wait till you hear this guy.
[01:51:01.104 --> 01:51:08.093]  This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about Graf Undersafes.com, the makers of the highest quality vault doors and safes available.
[01:51:08.093 --> 01:51:11.097]  Graf Undersafes are known as the Rolls-Royce of safes.
[01:51:11.097 --> 01:51:15.924]  Since 1968, they have operated based on their original principle, quality above all else.
[01:51:16.324 --> 01:51:16.585]  I think so.
[01:51:33.502 --> 01:51:39.205]  Graf Undersafes use only the highest quality heavy metals and cold steel locking bolts.
[01:51:39.205 --> 01:51:43.788]  Graf Undersafes are fire and burglar resistant and they even come with a lifetime warranty.
[01:51:43.788 --> 01:51:45.129]  Protect the things you care about.
[01:51:45.129 --> 01:51:47.190]  Go to GrafUndersafes.com.
[01:51:47.190 --> 01:51:51.052]  That's G-R-A-F-F-U-N-D-E-R safes dot com.
[01:51:51.052 --> 01:51:52.033]  Or give them a call at 866-457-1801.
[01:51:52.033 --> 01:51:53.614]  Or click on their banner at InfoWars.com today.
[01:52:01.545 --> 01:52:07.571]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:52:07.571 --> 01:52:13.457]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[01:52:13.457 --> 01:52:19.624]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:52:19.944 --> 01:52:21.905]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:52:21.905 --> 01:52:24.385]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[01:52:24.385 --> 01:52:37.568]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[01:52:37.568 --> 01:52:39.229]  It's not about left or right.
[01:52:39.229 --> 01:52:41.089]  It's about a one-world government.
[01:52:41.089 --> 01:52:47.331]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[01:52:47.998 --> 01:52:56.267]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:52:56.267 --> 01:52:57.849]  The Obama Deception.
[01:52:57.849 --> 01:52:59.031]  The people strike back!
[01:53:01.414 --> 01:53:06.919]  Millions of Americans are beginning to realize the enormity of the economic and political problems facing the U.S.
[01:53:06.919 --> 01:53:07.720]  and the world.
[01:53:07.720 --> 01:53:11.583]  And for the first time in their lives, they are feeling the need for preparedness.
[01:53:11.583 --> 01:53:18.088]  Ready Reserve Foods has been in continuous operation, manufacturing the finest and dehydrated foods for almost 40 years.
[01:53:18.088 --> 01:53:20.110]  Ready Reserve is the manufacturer.
[01:53:20.110 --> 01:53:28.057]  Unlike other companies that just broker canned foods, Ready Reserve controls the quality from start to finish with double enameled cans and nitrogen packaging.
[01:53:28.317 --> 01:53:33.043]  When purchasing from Ready Reserve Foods, you are buying factory direct at wholesale prices.
[01:53:33.043 --> 01:53:38.850]  Other companies are quoting delivery times of one to two months, while Ready Reserve ships within five business days.
[01:53:38.850 --> 01:53:41.033]  Many companies do not even offer a catalog.
[01:53:41.033 --> 01:53:44.357]  We will be more than happy to send a catalog to you, free of charge.
[01:53:44.697 --> 01:53:45.037]  Dial 1-800-453-2202.
[01:53:45.037 --> 01:53:45.117]  1-800-453-2202.
[01:53:45.117 --> 01:53:46.658]  Or visit our website at ReadyReserveFoods.com.
[01:53:46.658 --> 01:53:48.800]  Factory direct, wholesale pricing from Ready Reserve Foods.
[01:53:48.800 --> 01:53:49.240]  Call us at 1-800-453-2202.
[01:54:18.119 --> 01:54:37.364]  So much going on, so much going on So many things going on in the world Babies dying, mothers crying How much all this one human life worth
[01:54:39.764 --> 01:54:43.827]  Alright, going back to Mike in Wyoming.
[01:54:43.827 --> 01:54:46.989]  Mike, go ahead and finish the point you were making.
[01:54:46.989 --> 01:55:05.542]  You know, many of us, including your dad, I think, we're schooled by the Birch Society and one of the ideas that they've always pushed is taking back Congress by means of the House, the lower House of the Congress.
[01:55:06.506 --> 01:55:08.767]  And I ran for Congress last year.
[01:55:08.767 --> 01:55:13.749]  I was only in this little town for a little more than a year, so I didn't have any illusions about winning.
[01:55:13.749 --> 01:55:20.431]  But it was an education for me, and then I realized why the system is broken.
[01:55:20.431 --> 01:55:29.254]  All the debates, or almost all the debates, were set up by local chambers of commerce, or mining groups, or farming or ranching groups.
[01:55:30.354 --> 01:55:38.659]  Who all had their own agenda and a pretty well circumscribed set of questions that they wanted to address.
[01:55:38.659 --> 01:55:53.947]  If all you need to do, if you want to run for office, and if you don't mind being center stage, is maybe through your church or through contacts throughout your congressional district, call people, tell them, set up their own debate.
[01:55:53.947 --> 01:55:58.049]  They might have to create some kind of phony front organization to sound legit.
[01:55:59.319 --> 01:56:03.741]  You know, concern Christians of America or whatever.
[01:56:03.741 --> 01:56:10.164]  But send out invitations and do them, you know, on the weekend when people can actually attend.
[01:56:10.164 --> 01:56:17.987]  The problem was most of these organizations and chambers will do them during the week, and they were very poorly attended.
[01:56:17.987 --> 01:56:20.348]  And, you know, so it was very frustrating.
[01:56:20.348 --> 01:56:24.450]  They, you know, the questions really didn't bear on the important economic issues of the day.
[01:56:26.166 --> 01:56:29.747]  You know, they've limited your time to a great extent.
[01:56:29.747 --> 01:56:44.856]  If people set up their own debates, you know, with a much better framework, allowing several minutes to say what you want to say, and more meaningful questions, we could take back, you know, district by district this country.
[01:56:44.856 --> 01:56:45.756]  Exactly!
[01:56:45.756 --> 01:56:51.579]  The establishment sets the agenda with pop and diversions, and Michael Jackson for the general public.
[01:56:51.579 --> 01:56:54.181]  Then the people that are even politically involved, it's all special interest.
[01:56:55.537 --> 01:56:58.838]  I looked at running for office once, and it was all these groups sending me questionnaires.
[01:56:58.838 --> 01:57:01.279]  They all only care about their own special interests.
[01:57:01.279 --> 01:57:08.982]  We have to get the American people back involved, caring about the Bill of Rights and Constitution that was designed to protect us from all these special interests.
[01:57:08.982 --> 01:57:13.783]  The founding fathers were literal geniuses, but people keep saying the Constitution's failed.
[01:57:13.783 --> 01:57:14.684]  No, we failed.
[01:57:15.784 --> 01:57:29.307]  To enforce it and just running for mayor or City Council or County Commissioner or Water District or Congress means you get to go speak at these events and inject real issues, so Resistance is victory.
[01:57:29.307 --> 01:57:31.888]  Mike, good to hear from you.
[01:57:31.888 --> 01:57:38.329]  I'm gonna come back take a few more calls and at 8 after we're gonna get Wayne Paul on for the balance of the hour in the second segment of the next hour.
[01:57:40.816 --> 01:57:43.618]  I've already done two hours now here, or just shy of two hours.

[02:00:25.039 --> 02:00:30.724]  We're going live at PrisonPlanet.tv in about seven and a half minutes with Wayne Paul, brother of Dr. Ron Paul.
[02:00:30.724 --> 02:00:36.570]  We're going to play a clip of him from the Obama deception live at PrisonPlanet.tv and the audio over the radio.
[02:00:36.570 --> 02:00:38.111]  So that's coming up.
[02:00:38.111 --> 02:00:38.992]  Stay with us.
[02:00:38.992 --> 02:00:40.673]  He'll be with us for five minutes in the next hour.
[02:00:41.354 --> 02:00:47.015]  Then we're going to have Dr. Labo and her husband General Stubblebine on the show to talk about the whole eugenics agenda.
[02:00:47.015 --> 02:00:50.396]  But Wayne Paul is coming up, so stay with us.
[02:00:50.396 --> 02:00:51.897]  Right now, let's keep going to your calls.
[02:00:51.897 --> 02:00:56.738]  Let's talk to Jason in Colorado, then Kay, Ronnie, Phillip, Ronnie and others.
[02:00:56.738 --> 02:01:02.019]  Go ahead, you're on the air, Jason.
[02:01:02.019 --> 02:01:06.040]  Hey Alex, this is Jason calling from the beautifully fed and festive state of Colorado.
[02:01:07.242 --> 02:01:16.946]  I just wanted to see if you actually had a chance to look at the WHO update for July 16th regarding the swine flu.
[02:01:16.946 --> 02:01:22.449]  Yeah, they say we're level six and they're getting ready for global forced inoculation of three shots.
[02:01:22.449 --> 02:01:32.273]  And here in Austin they have the public already admitting on the newscast says it isn't even the right flu but the public doesn't care and the kids are all lining up to get the special shot the government wants you to have.
[02:01:32.853 --> 02:01:33.013]  Yep.
[02:01:33.013 --> 02:01:34.714]  Let me expand on that just for a second Alex.
[02:01:34.714 --> 02:01:36.154]  What I'm referring to is that
[02:01:53.962 --> 02:02:01.925]  The World Health Organization have been coming out with daily updates every two to three days with the number of confirmed cases and the number of deaths in each country.
[02:02:01.925 --> 02:02:12.909]  Today they came out with a report that says that they are no longer requiring countries to submit regular reports of individual laboratory confirmed cases and deaths to the World Health Organization.
[02:02:12.909 --> 02:02:14.029]  Well, I mean, what is it?
[02:02:14.029 --> 02:02:15.990]  I mean, there's several different tracking systems.
[02:02:15.990 --> 02:02:16.570]  What is it?
[02:02:16.570 --> 02:02:22.012]  It's like 170-something, I checked last week, on the World Health Organization.
[02:02:22.012 --> 02:02:23.213]  What are they saying it is right now?
[02:02:24.533 --> 02:02:25.554]  It was on July 6th.
[02:02:25.554 --> 02:02:27.875]  It was at right around 97,000.
[02:02:27.875 --> 02:02:29.695]  It had jumped 30%.
[02:02:29.695 --> 02:02:32.616]  No, I'm talking about deaths.
[02:02:32.616 --> 02:02:33.677]  No, they are not reporting it.
[02:02:33.677 --> 02:02:35.617]  They have not updated it since July 6th.
[02:02:35.617 --> 02:02:36.358]  That's what I'm telling you.
[02:02:36.358 --> 02:02:37.258]  That's what I'm telling you.
[02:02:37.258 --> 02:02:38.859]  I'm saying, what is the number?
[02:02:38.859 --> 02:02:40.079]  You're not listening.
[02:02:40.079 --> 02:02:41.280]  I don't have it in front of me.
[02:02:41.280 --> 02:02:44.461]  What I'm asking you is, what is the last number they're giving for deaths?
[02:02:46.044 --> 02:02:58.186]  I'd have to go in to look at the... I think it's 170 something, I checked it last week, but the... Yes, because it's all hype, it's all a lie, it's all much ado about nothing, and the last two swine flu outbreaks broke out at U.S.
[02:02:58.186 --> 02:03:09.588]  military bases, and this thing is... This is a giant PSYOP, and they're saying, you know, millions have it in the U.S., but yeah, you're carrying a no-big-deal virus.
[02:03:09.588 --> 02:03:12.028]  There's thousands of flu viruses out there.
[02:03:12.028 --> 02:03:13.549]  And so what do you think's going on with this?
[02:03:13.549 --> 02:03:14.629]  What do you think the bigger story is?
[02:03:15.555 --> 02:03:37.349]  Well, I think the bigger story is that if the World Health Organization is actually leading the charge on informing the public, not only in America but across the globe, and then now saying that they're no longer going to be requiring countries to report confirmed cases nor deaths, sounds to me like they're going to stop actually just tracking it on the larger level so that we can stay uninformed.
[02:03:37.349 --> 02:03:38.810]  Again, if it's, you know, does
[02:03:39.645 --> 02:03:42.667]  Yeah, I mean, I've been meaning to spend more time on this whole flu situation.
[02:03:42.667 --> 02:03:44.709]  As I said back when it first broke out,
[02:04:02.703 --> 02:04:04.424]  They were already really at level 5.
[02:04:04.424 --> 02:04:08.606]  They were going to go to level 6 within 96 hours, I believe the memo said.
[02:04:08.606 --> 02:04:09.226]  You can pull it up.
[02:04:09.226 --> 02:04:11.007]  It's on Infowars.com.
[02:04:11.007 --> 02:04:13.749]  And then it came out that we were telling you the truth and it was a real document.
[02:04:13.749 --> 02:04:15.410]  I got it from an official.
[02:04:15.410 --> 02:04:16.710]  I'll just say that.
[02:04:16.710 --> 02:04:18.831]  Public servant here in Austin.
[02:04:18.831 --> 02:04:21.193]  And then months later, yeah, they said, oh yeah, we've really been at level 6.
[02:04:21.193 --> 02:04:23.554]  So that's going on.
[02:04:23.554 --> 02:04:30.317]  I said either this is a giant hoax or they could be doing the big one right now because they've been gearing up for mass culling, mass death.
[02:04:30.317 --> 02:04:31.338]  This is one of their models.
[02:04:32.777 --> 02:04:39.822]  And now they're saying, oh yeah, it's going to get real bad and could kill millions in the fall when it's no big deal.
[02:04:39.822 --> 02:04:43.404]  Do they know it's going to mutate to something deadly?
[02:04:43.404 --> 02:04:46.066]  Usually mutates to something that's less harmful.
[02:04:46.066 --> 02:04:49.128]  Are they going to release something else that's similar?
[02:04:49.128 --> 02:04:56.133]  Is this their perfect cover for the collapsing economy in the fall and the global dictatorship being set up by the New Bank of the World?
[02:04:56.133 --> 02:04:58.375]  They've certainly got it in their fist of cards.
[02:04:58.375 --> 02:04:59.836]  They certainly could play that card.
[02:05:01.049 --> 02:05:02.730]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[02:05:02.730 --> 02:05:07.472]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[02:05:07.472 --> 02:05:10.433]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[02:05:10.433 --> 02:05:13.474]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[02:05:13.474 --> 02:05:18.196]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency.
[02:05:18.436 --> 02:05:19.557]  If you simply prepare.
[02:05:19.557 --> 02:05:22.800]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[02:05:22.800 --> 02:05:29.806]  You know efoodsdirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.

[02:06:06.708 --> 02:06:08.029]  Inner Health Botanicals.
[02:06:08.029 --> 02:06:12.291]  This company produces the highest quality superfood around, called Inner Food.
[02:06:12.291 --> 02:06:14.152]  My wife just loves the stuff.
[02:06:14.152 --> 02:06:20.475]  And now, the health ranger Mike Adams has awarded Inner Food his Editor's Choice Award for Best Superfood of 2009.

[02:06:26.198 --> 02:06:29.218]  It would be impossible to blend this up for a better price.
[02:06:29.218 --> 02:06:30.939]  And their formula really works.
[02:06:30.939 --> 02:06:33.740]  This is the real thing for the great health you need.
[02:06:33.740 --> 02:06:35.240]  Try the NutriCafe.
[02:06:35.240 --> 02:06:40.002]  Their great organic coffee infused with polysaccharides that boost the immune system.
[02:06:40.002 --> 02:06:42.423]  A truly healthy coffee that tastes great.
[02:06:42.423 --> 02:06:44.884]  And take it from me folks, it really does taste great.
[02:06:44.884 --> 02:06:46.984]  Don't forget to try their other great products.

[02:07:00.755 --> 02:07:04.998]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones and I want each of you to ask yourself this question.
[02:07:04.998 --> 02:07:07.000]  Do you really know what's in your tap water?
[02:07:07.000 --> 02:07:15.267]  In a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor, they found that over 260 chemicals and pollutants are present in municipal drinking water.
[02:07:15.507 --> 02:07:21.053]  Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive, immune, and developmental system diseases.
[02:07:21.053 --> 02:07:22.935]  Now what are you going to do about it?
[02:07:22.935 --> 02:07:29.441]  The Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator is a low-cost way to take back control of you and your family's drinking water.
[02:07:29.441 --> 02:07:33.986]  The Ecola Blue 28 produces up to 7 gallons of water from the humidity in the atmosphere.
[02:07:34.226 --> 02:07:34.626]  That's right.
[02:08:01.954 --> 02:08:04.719]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[02:08:04.719 --> 02:08:07.524]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:24.292 --> 02:08:29.674]  Well, we are locked and loaded and ready to go for the third hour of this transmission.
[02:08:29.674 --> 02:08:35.157]  It's already Thursday, the 16th of July, 2009.
[02:08:35.157 --> 02:08:42.421]  And for this hour and five minutes into the next hour, we have Wayne Paul, CPA and brother of Representative Dr. Ron Paul.
[02:08:44.198 --> 02:09:00.423]  And of course, Wayne appears in the Obama Deception, discusses the Social Security scam, the Federal Reserve, how the country is bankrupt and we are under emergency powers, and the security of the Treasury is really in control of the country, or how the Secretary of the Treasury is really in control of the country through the War Powers Act.
[02:09:00.423 --> 02:09:06.925]  In fact, let's play that scene of Wayne Paul in the Obama Deception, then we're going to go right to Wayne Paul.
[02:09:06.925 --> 02:09:07.285]  Here it is.
[02:09:08.360 --> 02:09:17.787]  In 1913, the Federal Reserve Act was passed for the House where three members of Congress were on the floor.
[02:09:17.787 --> 02:09:22.831]  At that time, they only needed a majority of votes to pass it.
[02:09:22.831 --> 02:09:27.034]  So in 1913, the Federal Reserve Act was passed.
[02:09:27.034 --> 02:09:34.760]  Twenty years later, 1933, under Roosevelt, the United States was declared bankrupt.
[02:09:36.201 --> 02:09:47.646]  And in 1933, the Federal Reserve Private Bank says, OK, USA, what are you going to pledge as collateral on the debt you owe me?
[02:09:47.646 --> 02:09:48.586]  What happened by 1936?
[02:09:48.586 --> 02:09:52.168]  Does anybody know?
[02:09:52.168 --> 02:10:04.313]  We instituted a social security system, and you and I and our children and our children's children were pledged as collateral on the debt of our government to the Federal Reserve.
[02:10:05.555 --> 02:10:06.976]  And that's where we're at today.
[02:10:06.976 --> 02:10:20.123]  It took 20 years to make this country bankrupt and since then our government has operated under emergency powers of our government.
[02:10:20.123 --> 02:10:24.085]  It is not the president that makes the decision in this country.
[02:10:25.402 --> 02:10:36.285]  It's the Secretary of Treasury who turns around and is put in there by the Federal Reserve to manage the bankruptcy.
[02:10:36.285 --> 02:10:38.885]  We've been in bankruptcy ever since.
[02:10:38.885 --> 02:10:43.886]  So to print $700 billion and to give it away, how do they get away with it?
[02:10:43.886 --> 02:10:49.548]  The manager of the bankruptcy is told by the Federal Reserve this is the way to go.
[02:10:49.548 --> 02:10:50.548]  That's where we're at today.
[02:10:51.681 --> 02:11:02.645]  Yes, we should point out, Congressman Ron Paul now has a huge amount of sponsors for a bill in the House of Representatives to abolish the private Federal Reserve.
[02:11:02.645 --> 02:11:04.026]  Alright, here we go folks.
[02:11:04.026 --> 02:11:09.127]  We're going to go ahead and go back now to our guest, Wayne Paul.
[02:11:09.127 --> 02:11:11.208]  Wayne, it's great to have you here with us today.
[02:11:11.208 --> 02:11:13.809]  It's good to be on board.
[02:11:13.809 --> 02:11:16.070]  Where are you joining us from today?
[02:11:16.070 --> 02:11:18.731]  I'm in East Texas at my home today.
[02:11:19.841 --> 02:11:23.784]  Fantastic, great to have you on with us.
[02:11:23.784 --> 02:11:48.864]  Wayne, there's so much to talk about, but let's begin with the issue you were just discussing, how this country was taken into receivership through fraud, because these shysters, these rhinestone con artists, these flim-flam artists, they create all this out of nothing, and they basically buy up the world out of nothing, and so they want to create a debt black hole
[02:11:49.801 --> 02:11:58.205]  A system to bankrupt the planet to then bring in their new world order, their new bank of the world, which they admit we're going to be paying our carbon taxes to.
[02:11:58.205 --> 02:12:02.087]  And you so eloquently broke that down, but can you further comment on that?
[02:12:02.087 --> 02:12:04.028]  Then we're going to go back to the beginning.
[02:12:04.028 --> 02:12:16.455]  I want to talk about you growing up with your brother outside Pittsburgh on a dairy farm and just what formed a great family like yours and then looking forward into some of the current things that are happening today.
[02:12:17.332 --> 02:12:25.736]  Well, I think the most fascinating thing is the bill that's on the floor of the House now as it relates to Audit the Fed.
[02:12:25.736 --> 02:12:43.326]  If somebody would have said to me five years ago that there would have been over 240 congressmen putting their name on the line to have the Federal Reserve Bank audited, I'd have never believed it.
[02:12:43.326 --> 02:12:43.986]  That alone
[02:12:44.827 --> 02:13:07.772]  It tells you and I and your listeners that the understanding of how the Federal Reserve Bank works and what it does to turn around and confiscate our private property, it's an amazing feat and I think that's something that will be changing the world if we can get that accomplished.
[02:13:10.402 --> 02:13:11.202]  Absolutely.
[02:13:11.202 --> 02:13:17.365]  You know, I love it when your brother's on television and they say, abolish the Federal Reserve, get rid of the income tax.
[02:13:17.365 --> 02:13:22.048]  How are we going to do that when we have to fund the government?
[02:13:22.048 --> 02:13:26.010]  And Ron Paul always says, this building behind me, the Capitol, was built
[02:13:26.874 --> 02:13:31.516]  For a hundred plus years before we had this foreign banking takeover.
[02:13:31.516 --> 02:13:35.917]  Can you get into the nature of the Federal Reserve, the War Powers Act?
[02:13:35.917 --> 02:13:39.498]  You know, go back through what you talked about in that video clip, but in more detail.
[02:13:39.498 --> 02:13:41.379]  The nature of our rulers and...
[02:13:42.319 --> 02:13:47.663]  It is amazing that five, ten years ago, almost no one knew it was a private run-for-profit criminal group.
[02:13:47.663 --> 02:13:54.209]  Now, it's a big national issue that nobody can audit it, that it says it's above the law, it won't tell Congress.
[02:13:54.209 --> 02:13:58.192]  Senator Sanders and others and your brother, the Congressman Ron Paul, say, where's the money?
[02:13:58.192 --> 02:13:58.772]  Where'd it go?
[02:13:58.772 --> 02:14:01.394]  And Bernanke says, I'm not going to tell you!
[02:14:01.394 --> 02:14:05.718]  Everybody, even if they're dumbed down, knows fundamentally nobody's above the law.
[02:14:06.018 --> 02:14:11.261]  They're asking, who are these private bankers that own everything and control the issuance of currency and credit?
[02:14:11.261 --> 02:14:25.911]  So, break down kind of the history of this group for us and then more on what is it like for you fighting them for decades to now see it really, really starting to be on the run, bleeding.
[02:14:25.911 --> 02:14:27.772]  I mean, it's a cornered rat.
[02:14:28.931 --> 02:14:56.791]  I think the fascinating thing about that is if you go to the Federal Reserve Act that was passed in 1913, in that act and in the bill, if anybody's interested, go on the web, under government, and read that act, and they define that the green stuff we have in our pocket, it is defined as a Federal Reserve Accounting Unit
[02:15:00.573 --> 02:15:06.434]  Take the first letter of each one of those words and what do you have?
[02:15:06.434 --> 02:15:13.436]  Federal Reserve Accounting Unit Dollar.
[02:15:13.436 --> 02:15:19.298]  They told us in 1913 what they were doing.
[02:15:19.298 --> 02:15:25.579]  Because those five letters spell fraud.
[02:15:25.579 --> 02:15:28.020]  So when you hear the vernacular that says
[02:15:29.186 --> 02:15:35.208]  Uh, fraud notes in your pocket, you understand where people got that thing.
[02:15:35.208 --> 02:15:53.553]  And that would create, that having been created then, we're now at a point where printing dollars no longer can be sustained by the productivity of free enterprise.
[02:15:53.553 --> 02:15:57.534]  There's just too many dollars in circulation.
[02:15:59.241 --> 02:16:22.101]  And I think, as you say, uneducated or people that don't have their research done or haven't done their research understand when they go to the store and go to buy a loaf of bread and it's now $2.50 and I used to buy a loaf of bread for 29 cents, something's wrong with somewhere.
[02:16:25.247 --> 02:16:27.128]  Well it absolutely is.
[02:16:27.128 --> 02:16:40.416]  And now they're going to a whole new unit of a global SDR where the central banks don't even have it backed up by the nation states or by the people paying the income tax into the private fellow reserve.
[02:16:40.416 --> 02:16:46.759]  Now it's just SDRs that are above even the nation state currency.
[02:16:46.759 --> 02:16:50.101]  So we're already going to this global cashless society right now.
[02:16:50.101 --> 02:16:54.304]  It's just a mopping up process to get rid of the national currencies or to convert them
[02:16:54.904 --> 02:16:54.984]  Yes.
[02:17:11.254 --> 02:17:14.415]  Well I think the exciting thing for me is the fact that even though I've known this
[02:17:40.186 --> 02:17:42.508]  And studied it for 25 years.
[02:17:42.508 --> 02:17:53.276]  I think I'm reminded most of all in this past year of a young gentleman in our area who was a senior in high school.
[02:17:53.276 --> 02:18:02.403]  And for his passage of his senior year, he had to write a senior thesis.
[02:18:02.403 --> 02:18:09.428]  And he studied and wrote his thesis on the Federal Reserve System and how it operated.
[02:18:10.453 --> 02:18:24.537]  And for me, a young person, age 17, having the knowledge that this fella has as to how it operates, got to be the most exciting thing.
[02:18:24.537 --> 02:18:36.920]  I look forward to the future only because I think, as Congressman Paul pointed out, it's the education process that really counts.
[02:18:36.920 --> 02:18:39.501]  And when we can see that in our young people,
[02:18:40.581 --> 02:19:03.808]  I can see light at the end of the tunnel that we're going to turn around and we're going to create a constitutional republic form of government and it's going to take all of us, starting from the local city offices to the county, to the state, to the federal, but it will change because of knowledge.
[02:19:05.973 --> 02:19:06.874]  I couldn't agree with you more.
[02:19:06.874 --> 02:19:07.954]  I am looking forward to that day.
[02:19:07.954 --> 02:19:10.236]  And I intend to be here when that day happens.
[02:19:28.237 --> 02:19:31.819]  Well, so many times in history, tyrants and tyrannies collapse.
[02:19:31.819 --> 02:19:38.261]  I think Gandhi, to paraphrase him, said it looks like the dictator, the corrupt leaders are invincible, but then suddenly they just collapse.
[02:19:38.261 --> 02:19:45.204]  You gotta just keep throwing the punches in there and not giving up, knowing we're gonna... That's like George Washington.
[02:19:45.204 --> 02:19:52.828]  When he finally won the war and they surrendered, he was stunned for several hours and didn't believe them, didn't understand after seven years of fighting.
[02:19:54.716 --> 02:19:55.176]  Stay there.
[02:19:55.176 --> 02:19:56.517]  Wayne Paul, always amazing.
[02:19:56.517 --> 02:19:59.139]  This is his maiden voyage on radio with us.
[02:19:59.139 --> 02:20:01.180]  Got a host of issues coming up.

[02:21:01.730 --> 02:21:07.756]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[02:21:07.756 --> 02:21:13.642]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[02:21:13.642 --> 02:21:19.809]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[02:21:20.249 --> 02:21:22.090]  Obama's already fudging.
[02:21:22.090 --> 02:21:24.571]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[02:21:24.571 --> 02:21:37.755]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[02:21:37.755 --> 02:21:39.416]  It's not about left or right.
[02:21:39.416 --> 02:21:41.277]  It's about a one-world government.
[02:21:41.277 --> 02:21:47.519]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[02:21:48.186 --> 02:21:56.451]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:21:56.451 --> 02:21:58.032]  The Obama Deception.
[02:21:58.032 --> 02:21:59.213]  The people strike back!
[02:22:00.711 --> 02:22:01.252]  Good day.
[02:22:01.252 --> 02:22:02.853]  Jim Newcomer from Midas Resources.
[02:22:02.853 --> 02:22:03.153]  July 16, 2009.
[02:22:03.153 --> 02:22:04.194]  Gold opened this morning at $940.
[02:22:04.194 --> 02:22:06.817]  A one-ounce gold coin can be purchased for $966.96, $4348 for a half-ounce, or $241.74 for the quarter-ounce.
[02:22:06.817 --> 02:22:07.417]  That's $966.96, $483.48, or $241.74.
[02:22:18.447 --> 02:22:22.389]  Bailout equals market distortions, increased money supply while productivity is going down.
[02:22:22.389 --> 02:22:26.632]  Wall Street is receiving injections of liquidity while smaller companies are forced to concede.
[02:22:26.632 --> 02:22:31.275]  Companies too big to fail are now using the tax dollars to increase market share, paying fat dividends.
[02:22:31.275 --> 02:22:36.818]  Are you wondering why supplies of gold and silver coins are decreasing rapidly, leaving the public scrambling to accumulate what's left?
[02:22:36.818 --> 02:22:40.060]  Fiat currency's value is based on trust, fiscal responsibility.
[02:22:40.060 --> 02:22:44.843]  Is Congress and the White House acting responsibly, earning your trust, or is it time to ensure your hard-earned wealth?
[02:22:44.963 --> 02:22:50.306]  Midas Resources offers economic insurance, gold and silver coins, 800-686-2237.
[02:22:50.306 --> 02:22:54.849]  Do you believe that more bailout will solve our economic problems, or would you like to call Midas Resources at 1-800-686-2237?
[02:22:54.849 --> 02:23:01.233]  That's Midas Resources at 1-800-686-2237.
[02:23:01.233 --> 02:23:06.377]  Studies have shown that many people do not get the proper vitamins and minerals necessary to maintain good health.
[02:23:06.377 --> 02:23:12.040]  With so many places to choose from, deciding where and what to buy can be a lengthy, frustrating process.
[02:23:12.040 --> 02:23:13.101]  The answer is simple.
[02:23:16.158 --> 02:23:16.518]  I think so.
[02:23:32.253 --> 02:23:32.613]  We're good.
[02:24:07.554 --> 02:24:12.096]  You can run on for a long time.
[02:24:12.096 --> 02:24:15.178]  You can run on for a long time.
[02:24:15.178 --> 02:24:18.800]  Run on for a long time.
[02:24:18.800 --> 02:24:21.582]  Run on for a long time.
[02:24:21.582 --> 02:24:24.563]  Sooner or later gotta cut you down.
[02:24:24.563 --> 02:24:26.284]  Sooner or later gotta cut you down.
[02:24:26.284 --> 02:24:31.787]  I like the Texas Ranger Credo, which is actually borrowed from one of the founding Texas Rangers.
[02:24:31.787 --> 02:24:36.930]  A man in the wrong can't stop a man in the right that keeps on a coming.
[02:24:39.005 --> 02:24:42.848]  And that's what we've got to do, because these people, me and business, we're fighting.
[02:24:42.848 --> 02:24:44.509]  Short segment right now, long one coming up.
[02:24:44.509 --> 02:24:50.174]  I wanted to get to some of the things that Wayne may never have talked about on air.
[02:24:50.174 --> 02:25:00.701]  First, then we'll get back into solutions and where this country's going and his brother and the family and now one of his nephews, Rand Paul, it looks like, is going to run for the Congress.
[02:25:01.806 --> 02:25:23.299]  But go back to your rural upbringing, some stories about you and your brothers, about Ron, and about what it's been like for you, how you woke up, how he woke up, or were you guys born awake, being born to hard-working farmers, dairy farmers, all you guys working from the time you were about
[02:25:24.079 --> 02:25:25.479]  Six, seven years old.
[02:25:25.479 --> 02:25:29.080]  Were you guys born awake, or what was the process like?
[02:25:29.080 --> 02:25:34.841]  Let us into a window of the icon that is your brother, Dr. Ron Paul, and yourself, of course.
[02:25:34.841 --> 02:25:36.361]  Okay.
[02:25:36.361 --> 02:25:39.242]  We were born and raised in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.
[02:25:39.242 --> 02:25:47.784]  Small rural town, and my mother and father had a dairy milk processing and delivery business.
[02:25:47.784 --> 02:25:50.204]  It started out in the basement of our house.
[02:25:51.460 --> 02:25:57.483]  And my mom and dad worked seven days a week to process bottled milk and deliver it.
[02:25:57.483 --> 02:26:07.647]  And we were always required on Sundays to go to church Sunday morning and my dad took off enough time to go to church.
[02:26:07.647 --> 02:26:12.329]  But he worked seven days a week up until I was in fifth grade.
[02:26:12.329 --> 02:26:15.691]  Now I'm the youngest of five boys.
[02:26:15.691 --> 02:26:18.512]  Ron is the middle of the five of us.
[02:26:19.252 --> 02:26:26.815]  So we claim he's the spoiled one in the family because the two oldest ones paid the wage for him.
[02:26:26.815 --> 02:26:33.358]  And then we were never allowed to do anything, but we have to say Ron got away with all of it.
[02:26:33.358 --> 02:26:37.560]  I'm saying that because he can't rebut that on this radio show.
[02:26:37.560 --> 02:26:40.321]  So, um, be careful.
[02:26:40.321 --> 02:26:41.982]  I might deny that later on.
[02:26:41.982 --> 02:26:43.002]  Anyway, um,
[02:26:46.147 --> 02:27:08.734]  My revelation into this knowledge started back in the early seventies, and it had to do with my representation of a taxpayer who, after I started to represent him, he ended up, six weeks after I met him, passing away.
[02:27:08.734 --> 02:27:14.576]  And it was a direct result of the confrontation he had
[02:27:15.808 --> 02:27:18.510]  With the Internal Revenue Service.
[02:27:18.510 --> 02:27:19.090]  Oh.
[02:27:19.090 --> 02:27:27.095]  And I said to myself, if this is the way it is, I'm not going to ever do another tax return.
[02:27:27.095 --> 02:27:30.977]  Because something's not right in the system.
[02:27:30.977 --> 02:27:43.345]  So that was my awakening call, and that started my research, my documentation, and everything that I've learned from that point on.
[02:27:45.856 --> 02:28:04.591]  Help me in better stead, made me better understand, and I think when people understand and learn, even if they can't do anything about it, they're better off morally, they're better off spiritually, and they're better off in their dealings with their fellow man.
[02:28:04.591 --> 02:28:06.753]  That makes all the difference in the world.
[02:28:09.403 --> 02:28:11.624]  What woke your brother up?
[02:28:11.624 --> 02:28:15.647]  Tell us about Congressman Ron Paul, your brother.
[02:28:15.647 --> 02:28:29.655]  Well, I think Ron's timing was the fact that when he was in college and medical school and working, he always had spare time.
[02:28:29.655 --> 02:28:36.599]  And he got involved in research and study of Ludwig von Mises.
[02:28:36.599 --> 02:28:38.961]  And von Mises is the father
[02:28:39.905 --> 02:28:44.327]  of free enterprise Austrian economics.
[02:28:44.327 --> 02:28:54.993]  And there's a Von Mises Institute that's in existence today that's extremely successful and continues to support free enterprise economics.
[02:28:54.993 --> 02:28:56.833]  And it's headed up by Lew Rockwell.
[02:28:56.833 --> 02:28:57.754]  That is correct.
[02:28:57.754 --> 02:29:08.179]  And it made a lot of sense to him, so he started to apply it, not only in his professional life,
[02:29:08.888 --> 02:29:19.655]  But in his personal life and was extremely successful in the implementation of free enterprise economics.
[02:29:19.655 --> 02:29:27.860]  And it was at that time that he started to formulate the idea that he needed to teach this to other people.
[02:29:27.860 --> 02:29:28.520]  All right, stay there.
[02:29:28.520 --> 02:29:31.462]  Let's continue with this on the other side and also talk about your saga.
[02:29:31.462 --> 02:29:33.984]  You've had quite a story as well.
[02:29:33.984 --> 02:29:35.385]  And then we'll open the phones up.
[02:29:36.192 --> 02:29:40.214]  Or Wayne Paul, brother of Congressman Dr. Ron Paul.
[02:29:40.214 --> 02:29:40.694]  1-800-259-9231.
[02:29:40.694 --> 02:29:40.874]  1-800-259-9231.
[02:29:40.874 --> 02:29:41.854]  Stay with us.
[02:29:41.854 --> 02:29:43.715]  PrisonPlanet.tv is the website.
[02:29:43.715 --> 02:29:44.775]  We're on the march.
[02:29:44.775 --> 02:29:45.516]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:45.516 --> 02:29:48.817]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:00.623 --> 02:30:02.003]  This is Alex Jones.
[02:30:02.003 --> 02:30:04.004]  Have you heard of the Millionaire Patriot?
[02:30:04.004 --> 02:30:04.984]  Well, you should.
[02:30:04.984 --> 02:30:09.466]  He has a free handgun and five days of firearms training waiting for you.
[02:30:09.466 --> 02:30:10.266]  That's right.
[02:30:10.266 --> 02:30:18.929]  You can attend five days of world-class gun training at Front Sight Firearms Training Institute and secure a 30-state concealed weapons permit.
[02:30:18.929 --> 02:30:20.290]  All for pennies on the dollar.
[02:30:20.290 --> 02:30:21.430]  Plus, if you act fast.
[02:30:21.650 --> 02:30:27.632]  The Millionaire Patriot will give you a free Springfield Armory XD pistol in the caliber of your choice.
[02:30:27.632 --> 02:30:34.515]  I believe now is the time that you and your family need to be armed and trained to levels that exceed law enforcement and military standards.
[02:30:34.515 --> 02:30:39.717]  Front Sight provides such training without any boot camp mentality or drill instructor attitudes.
[02:30:40.037 --> 02:30:41.498]  This is real.
[02:30:41.498 --> 02:30:42.558]  Don't miss out.

[02:31:00.953 --> 02:31:05.916]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator this summer.
[02:31:30.913 --> 02:31:31.053]  I think?
[02:32:00.930 --> 02:32:02.631]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[02:32:02.631 --> 02:32:07.352]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[02:32:07.352 --> 02:32:10.314]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[02:32:10.314 --> 02:32:13.355]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[02:32:13.355 --> 02:32:19.197]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency if you simply prepare.
[02:32:19.437 --> 02:32:22.681]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[02:32:22.681 --> 02:32:29.669]  You know eFoodsDirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.
[02:32:29.669 --> 02:32:32.952]  And they do it at almost half the cost of last year's grocery prices.
[02:32:32.952 --> 02:32:34.834]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or on the web go to eFoodsDirect.com
[02:32:38.098 --> 02:32:44.361]  Visit efoodsdirect.com and look over the fine list of high-quality, freeze-dried, and dehydrated foods they have to offer.
[02:32:44.361 --> 02:32:47.963]  Watch the free videos, look at their online catalog, or give them a call at 1-800-409-5633.
[02:32:47.963 --> 02:32:49.644]  Again, 800-409-5633, or on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[02:32:49.644 --> 02:32:50.104]  Take action today.
[02:32:50.104 --> 02:32:51.925]  The first step is getting storable food.
[02:33:13.283 --> 02:33:14.704]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[02:33:14.704 --> 02:33:15.365]  to 3 p.m.
[02:33:15.365 --> 02:33:17.207]  Central Standard Time.
[02:33:17.207 --> 02:33:21.611]  We're here live back Sundays 4 to 6 p.m.
[02:33:21.611 --> 02:33:25.615]  Jason Bermas will be here live this Sunday when I'm out of town.
[02:33:25.615 --> 02:33:30.680]  He jumps on a big jet airplane and goes out to do interviews for his film Invisible Enemies.
[02:33:30.680 --> 02:33:34.224]  That's what I'm off doing is doing interviews for the next film.
[02:33:34.224 --> 02:33:37.146]  We're going to go back to Wayne Paul here in just a moment and your phone calls.
[02:33:38.283 --> 02:33:44.852]  But before we do that, speaking of the free market, I want to tell you about some of the sponsors we have to make this radio show possible.
[02:33:44.852 --> 02:33:46.113]  And I do believe in these sponsors.
[02:33:46.113 --> 02:33:47.555]  We only take sponsors that I believe in.
[02:33:47.555 --> 02:33:48.977]  I think they have great products.
[02:33:48.977 --> 02:33:51.460]  And one of them is MySolarBackup.com.
[02:33:51.460 --> 02:33:53.302]  A lot of things can cut off your electrical power.
[02:33:53.302 --> 02:33:55.245]  Hurricanes, snow, ice storms.
[02:33:55.245 --> 02:33:56.786]  Research should move towards
[02:33:57.307 --> 02:34:00.593]  Getting off the grid and here's a good way to do just that.
[02:34:00.593 --> 02:34:04.540]  A solar power generator is now available from our longtime sponsor Solutions from Science.
[02:34:04.540 --> 02:34:07.746]  You get an emergency power backup kit which consists of the power source 1800 watt generator.
[02:34:09.864 --> 02:34:13.765]  And a high-efficiency solar panel designed to provide endless electricity.
[02:34:13.765 --> 02:34:16.266]  Remember, too, that gas generators need gas.
[02:34:16.266 --> 02:34:20.587]  But in a blackout, gas pumps can't pump gas because they run on electricity.
[02:34:20.587 --> 02:34:22.448]  It's the perfect emergency backup for troubled times.
[02:34:22.448 --> 02:34:25.409]  The government doesn't own the sun yet, folks, so make your move today.
[02:34:25.409 --> 02:34:27.209]  That's MySolarBackup.com.
[02:34:27.209 --> 02:34:29.310]  That's MySolarBackup.com.
[02:34:29.310 --> 02:34:30.330]  Or give them a call toll-free, 877-327-0365.
[02:34:30.330 --> 02:34:30.370]  877-327-0365.
[02:34:37.859 --> 02:34:41.342]  And one other sponsor I wanted to let you know about is HomeGain.
[02:34:41.342 --> 02:34:47.528]  You can check out Max Little Orange Gorilla at infowars.com and prisonplanet.com.
[02:34:47.528 --> 02:34:49.209]  It's a completely free site.
[02:34:50.362 --> 02:34:51.643]  It is advertiser-driven.
[02:34:51.643 --> 02:34:52.463]  It's a fabulous site.
[02:34:52.463 --> 02:34:54.104]  I've been around for more than 10 years.
[02:34:54.104 --> 02:34:57.186]  My favorite thing they have is the Home Sale Maximizer.
[02:34:57.186 --> 02:35:08.973]  You put in what type of house you have, the region it's in, the most inexpensive upgrades to do, the best resale, little things you can do, little tricks that really help get it sold for a higher price.
[02:35:08.973 --> 02:35:11.334]  They have the Street View thing that's free as well.
[02:35:11.334 --> 02:35:12.315]  They have a free estimate.
[02:35:12.935 --> 02:35:18.858]  You type in your home address, you'll get a free estimate of your home's value from the internal system that the realtors are seeing.
[02:35:18.858 --> 02:35:20.299]  It's HomeGain.com.
[02:35:20.299 --> 02:35:22.420]  H-O-M-E-G-A-I-N.com.
[02:35:22.420 --> 02:35:26.421]  HomeGain.com.
[02:35:26.421 --> 02:35:32.204]  Okay, going back to Wayne Paul, Dr. Ron Paul, Congressman Ron Paul's brother.
[02:35:32.204 --> 02:35:33.525]  Finishing up with your upbringing.
[02:35:35.501 --> 02:35:41.807]  Well, I think his total goal and effort when he first decided to run for Congress was to educate people in understanding free enterprise economics.
[02:36:01.801 --> 02:36:08.906]  And he said to Carol, his wife, the first time he ran, he said, uh, don't worry, Carol.
[02:36:08.906 --> 02:36:09.767]  I'm not going to win.
[02:36:09.767 --> 02:36:13.150]  I just want to get the message out.
[02:36:13.150 --> 02:36:18.754]  Well, the first time he didn't win, but she says, what are you going to do if you do win?
[02:36:18.754 --> 02:36:22.297]  Well, the next time he ran, he won.
[02:36:22.297 --> 02:36:29.482]  Now, when he first ran for Congress back in the mid seventies,
[02:36:30.768 --> 02:37:00.306]  He had a platform, one page platform he was running on and it just so happens that my wife gave him his first contribution and he sent her a thank you note and the second page was his platform of what he was running on which was basically free enterprise economics but if you were to read that single page today
[02:37:01.067 --> 02:37:06.491]  You would think he wrote it yesterday, because he's never changed.
[02:37:06.491 --> 02:37:22.884]  And I think that's the most consistent thing that anybody can ever say, as far as my brother's concerned, is he's never wavered from the truth, and from the facts, and from the Constitution.
[02:37:25.464 --> 02:37:32.427]  He has just been amazing and steadfast in that, and I think people today now realize that.
[02:37:32.427 --> 02:37:34.428]  And you judge a tree by its fruits.
[02:37:34.428 --> 02:37:39.251]  Do you remember any of the things on that one-page platform?
[02:37:39.251 --> 02:37:48.035]  Well, I can't remember right off, except while I'm talking, we'll find it.
[02:37:48.035 --> 02:37:48.995]  Maybe my wife can.
[02:37:48.995 --> 02:37:50.216]  Sure, sure, sure.
[02:37:50.216 --> 02:37:53.918]  Coming up after the next break, if you can, it's just very, very interesting history here.
[02:37:54.796 --> 02:37:55.877]  I don't
[02:38:14.417 --> 02:38:34.584]  During that campaign, but that they were worried about the movement, that the biggest movement now in high schools and universities wasn't the controlled left paradigm or the controlled right paradigm of the collectivist, but that people were now rediscovering the Bill of Rights Constitution and becoming free market constitutionalists, and that people were discovering the private Federal Reserve.
[02:38:34.584 --> 02:38:36.724]  And I think they had well-founded fears.
[02:38:36.724 --> 02:38:38.265]  Now, here we are a year and a half later.
[02:38:39.285 --> 02:38:52.171]  And we've gone from almost, and I know I keep repeating this, no one knowing the Fed was private, being laughed at, to now the enemies had to come out in the open and go, okay, we're private, but we run things for your own good, and if you audit us, we'll cause a depression.
[02:38:52.171 --> 02:38:55.093]  Basically terrorism, economic terrorism.
[02:38:55.093 --> 02:39:07.819]  And we have open announcements of a new bank of the world we'll pay our carbon taxes to, and now for world government, and hundreds and hundreds of articles a month pushing this on us, and nobody's buying it.
[02:39:09.042 --> 02:39:11.384]  All the things we talked about have come true and are happening.
[02:39:11.384 --> 02:39:23.492]  We're now at this key battle point in history that your brother talked about, that I talked about, that when the crisis came, when the bankers were imploding the world economy by design to bring in their system, that was a weak point for them.
[02:39:23.492 --> 02:39:36.981]  Their great moment of triumph, but also their weak point, if we point out, hey, the emperor's butt naked, this is a fraud, the emperor's new clothes, and now to really see it so viral, this idea of liberty,
[02:39:39.676 --> 02:39:41.516]  Well, I have a book sitting in front of me that I continually
[02:40:09.625 --> 02:40:17.247]  Tomorrow when we reread, it's called The History of Our National Debt, The Coming Battle.
[02:40:17.247 --> 02:40:22.069]  It's written by Lorraine and Paul Wolters.
[02:40:22.069 --> 02:40:34.813]  And if somebody really wants to understand where we're at, if they read this history, it'll absolutely... Yeah, didn't they republish that from an 1898 book and they wrote the foreword?
[02:40:34.813 --> 02:40:35.553]  That is correct.
[02:40:36.141 --> 02:40:37.381]  That's an excellent book.
[02:40:37.381 --> 02:40:47.063]  And it is so enlightening that it's worth the read by anybody interested in it.
[02:40:47.063 --> 02:40:50.464]  I keep reading it because I learn something new every time.
[02:40:50.464 --> 02:41:01.966]  And for those that don't know, this was a guy, I read it 10 years ago when he republished it, in banking, who saw all this coming and said, we're being taken over by bankers 15 years before they did it.
[02:41:01.966 --> 02:41:03.086]  Yeah, that's correct.
[02:41:04.828 --> 02:41:19.894]  Uh, in Ron's letter to my wife, he says I want to cut spending, cut taxes, cut inflation, when I have honest money.
[02:41:19.894 --> 02:41:21.634]  I want to cut crime.
[02:41:21.634 --> 02:41:25.996]  I want to let people live in peace and security.
[02:41:25.996 --> 02:41:29.197]  And I want to get rid of government controls and regulations.
[02:41:30.965 --> 02:41:40.012]  And that was basically one sheet of paper that he wrote back in 1974, which was the first time he ran.
[02:41:40.012 --> 02:41:48.819]  And his motto at that time was to say, put big government on a diet.
[02:41:48.819 --> 02:41:55.745]  And that was one of the first advertisements that he put out in mid-70s.
[02:41:58.309 --> 02:42:02.412]  Speaking of your brother, let me ask you a question, Wayne Paul.
[02:42:02.412 --> 02:42:08.436]  I challenged him about two months before he announced for president privately on the phone when he was on as a guest, even during the break.
[02:42:08.436 --> 02:42:11.879]  I said, please run, you gotta do it, just to educate the public.
[02:42:11.879 --> 02:42:14.160]  You morally cannot say no.
[02:42:14.160 --> 02:42:16.722]  I know you don't want to fly around and do the thousands of speeches.
[02:42:16.722 --> 02:42:18.764]  I know you already have an exhausting schedule.
[02:42:18.764 --> 02:42:22.467]  I know you're a real statesman, but I said, you must run for president.
[02:42:22.987 --> 02:42:23.087]  Well,
[02:42:51.360 --> 02:43:10.390]  I think it all boils down to whether the people were ready to hear the message in such a large arena as running for president.
[02:43:10.390 --> 02:43:19.695]  And I think he became amazed at the crowd, the numbers of people, the contributions he
[02:43:21.423 --> 02:43:42.268]  The effort that was put forth by people all over the country, the number of young people that came out and supported him, it actually, I think, blew him away and made him a very humble individual because he never expected it to be as big as it really was.
[02:43:42.268 --> 02:43:48.089]  So I think he was humbled by it.
[02:43:48.089 --> 02:43:50.090]  I think he was in awe by it.
[02:43:50.715 --> 02:44:00.766]  And I think every hour of every moment of every time he's spent doing that, he is absolutely delighted to have done it.
[02:44:00.766 --> 02:44:07.733]  And I think it continues today with his Campaign for Liberty program that he's working on now.
[02:44:07.733 --> 02:44:11.597]  Wayne, I want to talk more about the whole global picture with you and then take some calls.
[02:44:13.416 --> 02:44:25.560]  Some funny or interesting stories about your brother or your family, because people just love to hear them, that you've never told before or that you have never told on the radio before.
[02:44:25.560 --> 02:44:28.561]  Some interesting stuff about the young Ron Paul.
[02:44:28.561 --> 02:44:37.143]  Well, I think one of the most interesting things that I think of is he used to work in a drugstore.
[02:44:37.143 --> 02:44:40.084]  So we called him the soda jerk of the day.
[02:44:41.988 --> 02:44:47.569]  Well, he always had a ritual in his own mind as to how quickly he could get home so he was always timing himself.
[02:45:07.267 --> 02:45:35.184]  But one evening he was coming home and going up the hill and he was pumping so hard and so fast they forgot to look in front of him and he ran into a parked car and that parked car demolished the front of his bike but he picked up the bike and walked the other half mile to get home and when he got home his collarbone was sticking outside of his shirt
[02:45:37.139 --> 02:45:41.200]  That's just the type of person he was.
[02:45:41.200 --> 02:45:47.641]  And he wanted to make sure nobody took his bike, so he dragged it home with him.
[02:45:47.641 --> 02:45:54.483]  That's just the way he is, and most of the five of us are fairly competitive.
[02:45:54.483 --> 02:45:57.164]  My oldest brother has his Ph.D.
[02:45:57.164 --> 02:45:59.184]  in Mathematics.
[02:45:59.184 --> 02:46:02.585]  The next brother is a Doctor of Divinity.
[02:46:02.585 --> 02:46:06.606]  And of course Ron has three different degrees in Medicine.
[02:46:07.614 --> 02:46:18.176]  My next brother has a Doctor of Divinity also, so I have a brother who's a Lutheran minister and one that's a Presbyterian minister.
[02:46:18.176 --> 02:46:20.557]  Good quality, good quality salt of the earth.
[02:46:20.557 --> 02:46:21.997]  And you're a CPA, right?
[02:46:21.997 --> 02:46:22.777]  That's correct.
[02:46:22.777 --> 02:46:30.419]  They wanted me to be an undertaker so that they could take care of everybody, bring them into the world, raise them, educate them, and I could bury them.
[02:46:30.419 --> 02:46:37.320]  So we decided that if I did that, I would have a monopoly on life and the government wouldn't let me do it.
[02:46:40.863 --> 02:46:47.444]  Just amazing stories, hearing that.
[02:46:47.444 --> 02:46:51.885]  Some of the family background, is the family on both sides German?
[02:46:51.885 --> 02:46:53.265]  Where do the Pauls come from?
[02:46:53.265 --> 02:47:04.747]  Well, my grandfather came to this country as a 12-year-old from Germany, and came after his father came here before him.
[02:47:04.747 --> 02:47:08.668]  My mother was French-Irish, from Alsace to Lorraine.
[02:47:10.161 --> 02:47:23.831]  But I think it was the close-knit family and our Christian ties that really was a bulwark of our life.
[02:47:23.831 --> 02:47:36.862]  One of the other interesting things about my brother, and he still has it, when he first went to Congress, he bought a little Chevy Chevette to go from his apartment to Congress every day.
[02:47:37.805 --> 02:47:41.426]  And that chevette was two doors green.
[02:47:41.426 --> 02:47:43.466]  He still has it, by the way.
[02:47:43.466 --> 02:47:51.548]  There's pictures out of that chevette next to Tip O'Neill's limousine.
[02:47:51.548 --> 02:47:57.270]  And he obviously was proud of showing that in his congressional office or at home.
[02:47:57.270 --> 02:48:07.172]  So it's the interesting contrast between a very liberal individual spending your money and a very conservative just trying to represent you.
[02:48:07.927 --> 02:48:08.589]  Absolutely.
[02:48:08.589 --> 02:48:12.099]  I want to take calls in the next segment, but shifting gears in the big picture...
[02:48:13.360 --> 02:48:13.940]  Eugenics.
[02:48:13.940 --> 02:48:19.643]  I know you study banking, the Federal Reserve, but the overall plans of the global issue.
[02:48:19.643 --> 02:48:22.264]  You told me you've seen the Obama deception that you're in.
[02:48:22.264 --> 02:48:29.808]  Give me your view on eugenics, the master plan, the type of people that are the collectivists, and the type of societies they build.
[02:48:29.808 --> 02:48:39.993]  You know, really as an illustration of what the price is to pay if we that aren't parasites don't get things under control, we leave the world to these people.
[02:48:41.571 --> 02:49:10.861]  Yes, and that's difficult to really discuss and talk about because it's in an area that, you know, I look at my life and our family's life and as long as we stay the course and understand our responsibility, we believe that those types of things will get settled by a much higher power than us and that it is just something
[02:49:11.721 --> 02:49:27.174]  That at this stage of our lives, we have to talk about, learn about, and try to understand, but it's difficult to determine how we might fight it.
[02:49:27.174 --> 02:49:34.620]  It's just incredible to really see the New World Order come out in the open and uncloak itself, but it's even more incredible to see the people rise against it.
[02:49:34.620 --> 02:49:36.002]  It's just so exciting.
[02:49:36.002 --> 02:49:40.025]  Oh, I think we live in the most exciting times of our life.
[02:49:40.858 --> 02:49:43.720]  And I guess I'm looking forward to it.
[02:50:03.041 --> 02:50:10.262]  I am vaguely aware of it and saw a little bit of it, but I often sit back and admire my brother because he believes as long as you're telling the truth,
[02:50:32.222 --> 02:50:40.146]  And as long as you're putting forth the right effort, those types of attacks won't last very long.
[02:50:40.146 --> 02:50:42.387]  I kind of like seeing him get mad, though.
[02:50:42.387 --> 02:50:45.028]  For those that don't know, we haven't played it here because we're not being given any attention.
[02:50:45.028 --> 02:50:45.948]  I might, though.
[02:50:45.948 --> 02:50:47.689]  I mean, his video's out now.
[02:50:47.689 --> 02:50:50.570]  Ron Paul almost pops him, and it looks like shoves him.
[02:50:50.570 --> 02:50:51.611]  He's like, get out of here!
[02:50:51.611 --> 02:50:55.632]  It's kind of like you tell a cow to get out in the middle of the road.
[02:50:55.632 --> 02:50:57.373]  Just, just, just incredible.
[02:50:57.373 --> 02:50:59.134]  Let the media try to demonize him for that.
[02:51:01.306 --> 02:51:08.689]  As you already know, drinking pure high alkaline pH water is the most important factor in maintaining high energy and vibrant health.
[02:51:08.689 --> 02:51:13.351]  Most experts agree that the water you drink should be at a pH level of 8 or higher.
[02:51:13.351 --> 02:51:18.213]  Alkavision Plasma pH Drops combine a unique formula of the most alkaline ingredients.
[02:51:18.593 --> 02:51:26.299]  Using plasma pH drops is one of the best ways to make your water alkaline to help you get rid of acid and regain your health and energy.
[02:51:26.299 --> 02:51:30.883]  Simply put 10 drops per liter of water you drink to raise the pH to the ultimate level.
[02:51:30.883 --> 02:51:36.768]  Alkalizing water helps your body rid itself of acidic waste and increases the oxygen content of your body.
[02:51:37.068 --> 02:51:43.031]  Disease organisms like bacteria and cancer cannot survive in an alkaline, high pH environment.
[02:51:43.031 --> 02:51:48.614]  Order your bottle of AlkaVision Plasma pH Drops now by going directly to AlkaVision.com.
[02:51:48.614 --> 02:51:51.635]  That's A-L-K-A Vision dot com.

[02:52:01.730 --> 02:52:07.557]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[02:52:07.557 --> 02:52:15.146]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[02:52:15.146 --> 02:52:21.313]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[02:52:21.713 --> 02:52:23.694]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[02:52:23.694 --> 02:52:26.196]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[02:52:26.196 --> 02:52:37.762]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[02:52:37.762 --> 02:52:39.443]  It's not about left or right.
[02:52:39.443 --> 02:52:41.304]  It's about a one-world government.
[02:52:41.304 --> 02:52:47.528]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[02:52:56.472 --> 02:52:58.054]  The Obama Deception.
[02:52:58.054 --> 02:52:59.235]  The people strike back!
[02:53:01.201 --> 02:53:03.703]  It's a new year full of uncertainties.
[02:53:03.703 --> 02:53:06.044]  People are being laid off in record numbers.
[02:53:06.044 --> 02:53:10.267]  The price of food continues to rise, and the economy continues to falter.
[02:53:10.267 --> 02:53:12.568]  You know that you need to prepare.
[02:53:12.568 --> 02:53:16.371]  And maybe you've been putting it off, but the time to act is now.
[02:53:16.371 --> 02:53:19.433]  That's why you need to visit OrganicaSeed.com.
[02:53:19.973 --> 02:53:32.364]  At OrganicaSeed.com you'll find one of the largest online selections of heirloom seeds, survival seed packs, as well as the giant vegetable seed collections that can feed you and your family for years.
[02:53:32.364 --> 02:53:36.909]  Imagine growing your very own fresh vegetables, wheatgrass, fruits, herbs,
[02:53:37.369 --> 02:53:38.290]  I think so.
[02:54:04.733 --> 02:54:08.657]  It seemed like yesterday, but it was long ago.
[02:54:08.657 --> 02:54:11.079]  Started this fight against the Federal Reserve.
[02:54:11.079 --> 02:54:14.021]  They even kidnapped congressman's kids and killed them to try to shut it down.
[02:54:14.021 --> 02:54:16.063]  But here we are.
[02:54:16.063 --> 02:54:17.464]  You can feel the momentum shifting.
[02:54:17.464 --> 02:54:25.371]  No matter what events the private bank stage, no matter what scams they run, their days are numbered.
[02:54:25.371 --> 02:54:29.535]  The momentum has shifted against them and they know their destruction, their defeat is inevitable.
[02:54:31.735 --> 02:54:35.559]  Let's take a few final calls here for Wayne Paul.
[02:54:35.559 --> 02:54:39.002]  Let's talk to Ronnie in Texas, Steve, Jay, Kay, Philippe, and others.
[02:54:39.002 --> 02:54:40.403]  Ronnie, you're on the air with Wayne Paul.
[02:54:40.403 --> 02:54:41.284]  Go ahead.
[02:54:41.284 --> 02:54:41.745]  Thank you.
[02:54:41.745 --> 02:54:42.385]  Thank you, sir.
[02:54:42.385 --> 02:54:44.968]  Wayne Paul, you're number four for me.
[02:54:44.968 --> 02:54:46.069]  I'm so honored to speak to you.
[02:54:46.953 --> 02:55:06.049]  I spoke with obviously Dr. Paul and Carol and his other brother Randy and you but I have a question for you and a couple of comments but one photo that I saw while I was campaigning in Iowa for Dr. Paul was of Dr. Paul in a baseball uniform and I wasn't sure if he either played pro baseball or just in college.
[02:55:08.385 --> 02:55:21.232]  That was a congressional baseball game that the Congress took on, I think it was the Washington Senator, and Ron got the Astros to send him a uniform.
[02:55:21.232 --> 02:55:26.635]  And oddly enough, in that ball game, Ron hit a home run.
[02:55:26.635 --> 02:55:27.476]  Well, thank you.
[02:55:27.476 --> 02:55:29.637]  As you know, he's a founding father among us now.
[02:55:29.637 --> 02:55:32.539]  The force is with him.
[02:55:32.539 --> 02:55:36.201]  And my question, my major question, like you, sir,
[02:55:37.307 --> 02:55:50.733]  I know he's not in favor of, or I'm assuming like you, he's not in favor generally of people doing drugs, but Dr. Paul is more vehemently opposed to our own continually counterproductive war on pot smokers and hemp enthusiasts.
[02:55:50.733 --> 02:55:57.796]  So equating alcohol with THC is a lie, and alcohol is, you know, with the fetal alcohol syndrome, etc.
[02:55:57.796 --> 02:56:00.957]  It's a toxic poison, and THC is non-toxic medicine.
[02:56:01.594 --> 02:56:03.875]  Okay, listen, I appreciate your call.
[02:56:03.875 --> 02:56:15.579]  Yeah, your comments on drug decriminalization, not legalization like Soros wants, decriminalization so that we don't spend all our time and energy locking up people that need treatment.
[02:56:15.579 --> 02:56:16.819]  And I agree with that.
[02:56:16.819 --> 02:56:27.843]  I think Ron's beliefs and my beliefs are very similar in that, that that is a moral issue that is a personal choice of people.
[02:56:28.664 --> 02:56:31.805]  It doesn't mean that we condone it.
[02:56:31.805 --> 02:56:44.909]  It only means that we should help that individual so that those things do not become addictive and they do not start to control their life.
[02:56:44.909 --> 02:56:45.909]  And that's the issue.
[02:56:47.341 --> 02:56:51.943]  Look, areas of Europe have decriminalized heroin and in some areas it's cut it by half.
[02:56:51.943 --> 02:56:53.684]  Everywhere it's gone down at least by 25%.
[02:56:53.684 --> 02:56:56.385]  People can pull those numbers up.
[02:56:56.385 --> 02:57:00.207]  There's different numbers per country, different cities, but it's all a massive decrease.
[02:57:00.207 --> 02:57:08.431]  And people stop robbing your house for your stereo and computer because the stuff is super cheap and it's from a kind of government or city dispensary.
[02:57:08.431 --> 02:57:15.354]  And probably 80% of those people behind bars in prisons would not be there if it wasn't for that.
[02:57:16.414 --> 02:57:21.517]  Well, plus they admit our troops guard the poppy fields in Afghanistan, and it's up nine times.
[02:57:21.517 --> 02:57:23.658]  I mean, they're shipping it in.
[02:57:23.658 --> 02:57:25.338]  I mean, of course the elites do that.
[02:57:25.338 --> 02:57:31.561]  We're talking about hundreds of billions a year of secret money they get to fractionally reserve loan out.
[02:57:31.561 --> 02:57:35.163]  Let's take one more call here right in this hour, and we'll come back in five more minutes.
[02:57:35.163 --> 02:57:36.524]  Steve in Canada.
[02:57:36.524 --> 02:57:37.104]  You're on the air.
[02:57:37.104 --> 02:57:39.145]  Go ahead.
[02:57:39.145 --> 02:57:40.046]  Hi there, Alex.
[02:57:40.046 --> 02:57:41.746]  I'm a long-time listener, big-time fan.
[02:57:43.772 --> 02:57:47.715]  I got a comment which will lead into a question for Mr. Paul there.
[02:57:47.715 --> 02:57:50.678]  My comment is about the H.R.
[02:57:50.678 --> 02:57:57.404]  2454, the Climate Change Act that just got passed there in the states.
[02:57:57.404 --> 02:57:59.345]  It passed the House, it hasn't passed the Senate.
[02:57:59.345 --> 02:58:01.247]  It hasn't yet, eh?
[02:58:01.247 --> 02:58:03.929]  That was actually one of my questions.
[02:58:03.929 --> 02:58:10.415]  If that does pass, I just want your listeners to know that there's a great video out there called the Great Global Warming Swindle.
[02:58:11.483 --> 02:58:14.884]  And it's available on YouTube and Google Video and all those places.
[02:58:14.884 --> 02:58:15.584]  Yeah, it's free.
[02:58:15.584 --> 02:58:16.184]  It's incredible.
[02:58:16.184 --> 02:58:18.885]  It's got all the climatologists and scientists.
[02:58:18.885 --> 02:58:19.285]  Thank you.
[02:58:19.285 --> 02:58:20.265]  I'm going to jump.
[02:58:20.265 --> 02:58:20.805]  Great points.
[02:58:20.805 --> 02:58:27.587]  We're going to come back in 70 seconds with Wayne Paul, Ron Paul's brother and an activist against tyranny as well.
[02:58:27.587 --> 02:58:33.728]  And I guess we can say chip off the old block because he is Ron's younger brother, one of his younger brothers.
[02:58:33.728 --> 02:58:38.229]  And we will ask him about the global warming tax.
[02:58:42.987 --> 02:58:45.614]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[02:58:45.614 --> 02:58:48.783]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today!
[02:58:50.964 --> 02:58:55.205]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones, and I want each of you to ask yourself this question.
[02:58:55.205 --> 02:58:57.205]  Do you really know what's in your tap water?
[02:58:57.205 --> 02:59:05.727]  In a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor, they found that over 260 chemicals and pollutants are present in municipal drinking water.
[02:59:05.727 --> 02:59:11.269]  Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive, immune, and developmental system diseases.
[02:59:11.269 --> 02:59:12.889]  Now, what are you going to do about it?
[02:59:13.129 --> 02:59:19.655]  The Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator is a low-cost way to take back control of you and your family's drinking water.
[02:59:19.655 --> 02:59:30.706]  The Ecola Blue 28 produces up to 7 gallons of water from the humidity in the atmosphere and uses state-of-the-art carbon filtration, reverse osmosis, and ultraviolet light sterilization techniques.
[02:59:30.706 --> 02:59:31.486]  That's right.
[02:59:31.486 --> 02:59:34.049]  Clean water, right from the air you breathe.
[02:59:34.049 --> 02:59:35.630]  Order today by calling 1-800-691-8255.
[02:59:37.552 --> 02:59:39.114]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:12.134 --> 03:00:22.102]  All right, final minutes with Wayne Paul, some more of your phone calls, then General Stubblebine and Dr. Lambeau will be joining us to talk about eugenics.
[03:00:22.102 --> 03:00:31.330]  Wayne, global warming tax over every facet of our lives, federal inspections, total federalization, eugenics agenda for the control freaks around our lives.
[03:00:31.330 --> 03:00:34.893]  Your take on the global warming cap and trade and on eugenics.
[03:00:40.839 --> 03:00:42.740]  Wayne, are you there?
[03:00:42.740 --> 03:00:43.681]  Yes, sir.
[03:00:43.681 --> 03:00:44.401]  Okay, great.
[03:00:44.401 --> 03:00:47.663]  Your take on the global warming tax and eugenics?
[03:00:47.663 --> 03:01:00.510]  Well, as far as global warming is concerned, I do think the cat is out of the bag, that a lot of that is hoped.
[03:01:00.510 --> 03:01:04.072]  I think if we learned anything from it,
[03:01:04.924 --> 03:01:16.420]  We should be more aware of our environment and take better care of it, but I think global warming has come and gone over the last 200 years.
[03:01:18.127 --> 03:01:22.929]  That I don't think there's anything different today than it was when we settled this country back then.
[03:01:22.929 --> 03:01:29.351]  Well, I agree with you, and they piggyback legitimate environmental issues that could be handled civilly.
[03:01:29.351 --> 03:01:35.113]  You do some toxic waste dumping on somebody, they can take you to the cleaners or get you put in prison.
[03:01:35.113 --> 03:01:36.214]  That's correct.
[03:01:36.214 --> 03:01:42.176]  But they love these new systems that are extrajudicial outside the system, and they mean business.
[03:01:42.176 --> 03:01:42.476]  Go ahead.
[03:01:42.898 --> 03:01:44.939]  Well, and it's cold.
[03:01:44.939 --> 03:01:47.299]  I don't have enough of your property.
[03:01:47.299 --> 03:01:52.261]  I want a little bit more, so they try different ways to plunder your property.
[03:01:52.261 --> 03:01:55.262]  And that's, in effect, what Cap and Trade's gonna do.
[03:01:55.262 --> 03:01:57.843]  And then look at government being the biggest polluter out there.
[03:01:58.573 --> 03:01:59.633]  Absolutely.
[03:01:59.633 --> 03:02:04.795]  I mean, this is, like, CPS is five to seven times more likely, depending on what state, to abuse your children.
[03:02:04.795 --> 03:02:08.076]  They're the most dangerous people out there, so they're the ones that watch the kids.
[03:02:08.076 --> 03:02:09.056]  I mean, give me a break.
[03:02:09.056 --> 03:02:12.337]  Every pedophile in the world wants to be a CPS worker.
[03:02:12.337 --> 03:02:14.138]  I mean, put two and two together, of course.
[03:02:14.138 --> 03:02:17.259]  Jay in Oregon, last caller for our guest, Wayne Paul, Ron Paul's brother.
[03:02:17.259 --> 03:02:18.139]  Go ahead.
[03:02:18.139 --> 03:02:18.899]  Hi, Wayne.
[03:02:18.899 --> 03:02:21.000]  Hi, Jay.
[03:02:21.000 --> 03:02:23.341]  Actually, I got two parts of a question, two questions for you.
[03:02:23.341 --> 03:02:24.221]  Go ahead.
[03:02:24.221 --> 03:02:25.822]  And, question one,
[03:02:27.526 --> 03:02:41.833]  How do you reconcile the cognitive dissonance of working to quell what you guys are calling the rise of the One World Government, One World Economy, One World Currency, when it's clear in the Word of God that this is going to happen?
[03:02:43.769 --> 03:02:45.550]  Yeah, it was clear in 70 A.D.
[03:02:45.550 --> 03:02:48.491]  they thought it was the end of the world when Jerusalem was sacked.
[03:02:48.491 --> 03:02:51.352]  They thought it was the end of the world when Hitler was killing people.
[03:02:51.352 --> 03:02:53.053]  You've got all these different empires.
[03:02:53.053 --> 03:03:02.676]  How do you reconcile in the word of God that it's our job to fight evil, whatever the cost may be?
[03:03:02.676 --> 03:03:04.837]  It's not to us to choose.
[03:03:04.837 --> 03:03:07.598]  It's us to do the right thing.
[03:03:07.598 --> 03:03:08.478]  Duty is ours.
[03:03:08.478 --> 03:03:09.719]  Consequence belongs to God.
[03:03:09.719 --> 03:03:10.679]  I mean, is that what you're saying?
[03:03:10.679 --> 03:03:12.160]  Or what are you getting at?
[03:03:12.853 --> 03:03:15.275]  Well, Alex, I know your position real well.
[03:03:15.275 --> 03:03:16.436]  I was asking Mr. Paul.
[03:03:16.436 --> 03:03:17.997]  Okay, go ahead.
[03:03:17.997 --> 03:03:18.597]  We'll let you go.
[03:03:18.597 --> 03:03:20.098]  Mr. Paul, go ahead.
[03:03:20.098 --> 03:03:21.199]  Okay.
[03:03:21.199 --> 03:03:35.370]  My answer to that question is it doesn't change my Christian obligation as to how I live and how I am a steward of the property I've been entrusted with.
[03:03:35.370 --> 03:03:40.634]  Regardless of what may be God's will, I have
[03:03:42.012 --> 03:04:07.123]  I have been instructed by the Word to live a life that is a stewardship life in terms of the property I have, in terms of the people I associate with, my peer group, and my responsibility is to do it according to God's Word, and God's going to take care of the rest of the thing.
[03:04:07.782 --> 03:04:09.723]  So I'm not going to worry about it.
[03:04:09.723 --> 03:04:19.629]  I still have to fight the battle that the Federal Reserve System is an evil system and needs to be abolished.
[03:04:19.629 --> 03:04:20.710]  It doesn't change the facts.
[03:04:20.710 --> 03:04:30.056]  Yeah, it was the pastors that led the Revolutionary War against England, and a few of the pastors did say it's God's will, lay down Romans 13 out of context.
[03:04:30.056 --> 03:04:31.937]  Look at the prophets, look at the whole Bible.
[03:04:31.937 --> 03:04:34.499]  It's about standing up against evil and fighting evil.
[03:04:34.499 --> 03:04:36.020]  Callers, does that answer your question, Jay?
[03:04:37.236 --> 03:04:38.037]  It does enough.
[03:04:38.037 --> 03:04:38.918]  Thank you.
[03:04:38.918 --> 03:04:39.298]  You bet.
[03:04:39.298 --> 03:04:46.565]  I mean, these devil churches funded by the Rockefellers publicly, World Council of Churches, are telling people stand down.
[03:04:46.565 --> 03:04:48.867]  And, uh, it's incredible.
[03:04:48.867 --> 03:04:50.788]  Wayne Paul, amazing having you on.
[03:04:50.788 --> 03:04:52.170]  Thank you.
[03:04:52.170 --> 03:04:52.810]  Thank you.
[03:04:52.810 --> 03:04:54.152]  I appreciate it.
[03:04:54.152 --> 03:04:56.974]  We appreciate you being on, and he's in the Obama Deception, folks.
[03:04:56.974 --> 03:04:59.496]  Let me say bye to you during the break, Wayne.
[03:04:59.496 --> 03:04:59.897]  Stay with us.
[03:05:01.035 --> 03:05:06.879]  This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you again about a company that has supported us in the truth movement for years.
[03:05:06.879 --> 03:05:08.200]  Inner Health Botanicals.
[03:05:08.200 --> 03:05:12.463]  This company produces the highest quality superfood around, called Inner Food.
[03:05:12.463 --> 03:05:14.325]  My wife just loves the stuff.
[03:05:14.325 --> 03:05:20.649]  And now, the health ranger Mike Adams has awarded Inner Food his Editor's Choice Award for Best Superfood of 2009.
[03:05:21.770 --> 03:05:24.631]  Inner Food is loaded with 20 great organic ingredients.
[03:05:24.631 --> 03:05:26.372]  No fillers, no sweeteners.
[03:05:26.372 --> 03:05:29.392]  It would be impossible to blend this up for a better price.
[03:05:29.392 --> 03:05:31.093]  And their formula really works.
[03:05:31.093 --> 03:05:33.914]  This is the real thing for the great health you need.
[03:05:33.914 --> 03:05:35.394]  Try the NutriCafe.
[03:05:35.394 --> 03:05:40.176]  Their great organic coffee infused with polysaccharides that boost the immune system.
[03:05:40.176 --> 03:05:42.597]  A truly healthy coffee that tastes great.
[03:05:42.597 --> 03:05:45.058]  And take it from me folks, it really does taste great.
[03:05:45.058 --> 03:05:47.138]  Don't forget to try their other great products.
[03:05:47.138 --> 03:05:48.719]  Go to www.
[03:05:49.659 --> 03:05:50.139]  We're good.
[03:06:01.206 --> 03:06:06.189]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator this summer.
[03:06:31.186 --> 03:06:31.366]  I think?
[03:07:01.394 --> 03:07:01.574]  I think?
[03:07:16.391 --> 03:07:16.751]  I don't know.
[03:07:35.126 --> 03:07:37.727]  Here's what you do and start changing your life today!
[03:08:06.198 --> 03:08:11.042]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[03:08:11.042 --> 03:08:12.624]  You want answers?
[03:08:12.624 --> 03:08:14.185]  Well, so does he.
[03:08:14.185 --> 03:08:18.369]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:08:18.369 --> 03:08:24.514]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[03:08:24.514 --> 03:08:31.881]  Well, joining us from the United Kingdom are Prima Labo, Medical Doctor, Albert Install by the Third General,
[03:08:33.536 --> 03:08:34.817]  Both of their bios are amazing.
[03:08:34.817 --> 03:08:35.897]  We've got 51 minutes with them.
[03:08:35.897 --> 03:08:48.865]  We're talking about the forced inoculation plans, worldwide, level 6, what's really in the triple jab, the right of self-shielding, what that means, the new developments with the U.S.
[03:08:48.865 --> 03:08:58.110]  head science czar writing an internal government textbook, 1,100 pages, on how to carry out a world government eugenics extermination plan.
[03:08:58.110 --> 03:09:00.772]  This is confirmation of everything we've reverse-engineered.
[03:09:02.532 --> 03:09:03.695]  State Department memorandum 200.
[03:09:03.695 --> 03:09:08.304]  United Nations Biological Diversity Assessment 96.
[03:09:08.304 --> 03:09:09.887]  We have all the pieces.
[03:09:09.887 --> 03:09:11.951]  It's all stated, but this is all in one place.
[03:09:13.712 --> 03:09:19.674]  And it's just devastating because, you know, even though I know all this stuff, you don't want to believe they're actually doing it.
[03:09:19.674 --> 03:09:26.577]  Forced drugging, forced sterilization, forced abortion, drugs in the water, the food, genetically engineered to sterilize mammals.
[03:09:26.577 --> 03:09:27.497]  It's coming up.
[03:09:27.497 --> 03:09:30.818]  Major General Albert Burt Stubblebine, the third U.S.
[03:09:30.818 --> 03:09:33.039]  Army retired, graduate of U.S.
[03:09:33.039 --> 03:09:34.600]  Military Academy, West Point, class of 52.
[03:09:35.680 --> 03:09:37.621]  Who enjoyed a distinguished 32-year career in the U.S.
[03:09:37.621 --> 03:09:39.803]  Army, during which he commanded soldiers at every level.
[03:09:39.803 --> 03:09:45.946]  After his retirement, he served as VP for Intelligence Systems with BDM, a major defense contractor.
[03:09:45.946 --> 03:09:55.853]  He's also taken a set of experiences and become involved in leading edge medical research and development in collaboration with his wife, Rima E. Labo, MD.
[03:09:55.853 --> 03:09:59.155]  He is a long-term, way-out-of-the-box thinker who
[03:10:00.580 --> 03:10:01.561]  Redesigned the U.S.
[03:10:01.561 --> 03:10:05.725]  Army's intelligence architecture while serving as the commanding general of the U.S.
[03:10:05.725 --> 03:10:09.168]  Army Intelligence School and Center and helped to define the requirements of the U.S.
[03:10:09.168 --> 03:10:15.133]  Army to future conflict and redesigned and earned his place in the Intelligence Hall of Fame.
[03:10:15.133 --> 03:10:17.315]  Many of the innovations he developed helped the U.S.
[03:10:17.315 --> 03:10:21.158]  conduct the first Gulf War effectively and swiftly with a very low casualty rate.
[03:10:21.158 --> 03:10:22.159]  He also commanded the U.S.
[03:10:22.159 --> 03:10:25.642]  Army Electronic Research and Development Command and the U.S.
[03:10:25.642 --> 03:10:27.984]  Army's Intelligence and Security Command.
[03:10:29.232 --> 03:10:30.914]  And it just goes on and on.
[03:10:30.914 --> 03:10:36.019]  So, uh, I guess General, then you'd be a Major General when you retired?
[03:10:36.019 --> 03:10:37.280]  That is correct.
[03:10:38.075 --> 03:10:41.817]  Okay, we're gonna go to you in a second, sir, and we appreciate you joining us on the interview today.
[03:10:41.817 --> 03:10:51.942]  Let's go to your wife, the medical doctor first, in light of, give us your perspective, and then I wanna get the general's perspective, on the Mass Eugenics Plan.
[03:10:51.942 --> 03:10:53.803]  We have right of self-defense.
[03:10:53.803 --> 03:10:59.326]  This is a government-level PhD textbook for government leaders for policy.
[03:10:59.326 --> 03:11:01.748]  I've now read over 400 pages of the 1100.
[03:11:01.748 --> 03:11:02.608]  Total nightmare.
[03:11:02.608 --> 03:11:05.510]  Doctor, this is exactly what you've been saying for decades.
[03:11:06.070 --> 03:11:15.535]  Break down what this new development means, then we'll get the General's take, and then we'll expand out into what this flu vaccination means.
[03:11:15.535 --> 03:11:26.561]  I'm happy to do that, Alex, and I want you to know that both the General and I are happy and privileged to have the opportunity to talk to you and your listeners about this.
[03:11:26.561 --> 03:11:31.463]  This is a critical time, and the first thing I want to do is start at the very end.
[03:11:31.463 --> 03:11:35.025]  The very end is, unless you, listeners,
[03:11:35.734 --> 03:11:38.155]  Take action now.
[03:11:38.155 --> 03:11:56.440]  You will be faced with involuntary detention or mandatory vaccination with an attenuated live virus vaccine containing deadly adjuvants, the same things that caused Gulf War Syndrome in 700,000 soldiers.
[03:11:56.440 --> 03:11:57.120]  And you will have
[03:12:00.902 --> 03:12:12.949]  No recourse, no legal recourse, and you will have no financial recourse because vaccine makers are protected by the Fraud and Death Administration and by the Spineless Worthless Congress of the United States.
[03:12:12.949 --> 03:12:16.952]  And if you'd like, later, Alex, I'll tell you how I feel about the Congress.
[03:12:16.952 --> 03:12:21.714]  Anyway, the point is that you have a moment now.
[03:12:21.714 --> 03:12:27.898]  If you go to our website, which is healthfreedomusa.org, healthfreedomusa.org,
[03:12:30.075 --> 03:12:30.877]  I'm good.
[03:12:47.748 --> 03:12:59.336]  To refuse vaccines, refuse incarceration, and instead retire to your home for the quarantine period and self-shield.
[03:12:59.336 --> 03:13:13.967]  Now, the best friend that Health Freedom has in the United States Congress is willing to take this onto the floor and create a bill, and introduce a bill, if there is enough support from all of us.
[03:13:14.474 --> 03:13:24.841]  So if ever you valued your freedom, if ever you valued your right to make your own health decisions, and if ever you distrusted the government, now is the time.
[03:13:24.841 --> 03:13:31.186]  Go to healthfreedomusa.org and click on the top action item.
[03:13:31.186 --> 03:13:38.210]  Because if you don't, you will be either mandatorily vaccinated or you will be incarcerated.
[03:13:38.210 --> 03:13:41.873]  And now to answer your question, Alex, because that's the bottom line,
[03:13:42.611 --> 03:14:01.039]  The answer is yes, the vaccine against this genetically engineered weaponized H1N1 virus, which we are now being told, golly gee willikers, this resembles the 1918 swine flu pandemic virus.
[03:14:01.039 --> 03:14:11.163]  Well, yes, of course it does, because the genes were introduced intentionally into this new virus when they fizzled after being introduced into the avian flu virus.
[03:14:11.681 --> 03:14:19.343]  So, now the vaccine will be a deadly, quote, remedy to get rid of a large number of us.
[03:14:19.343 --> 03:14:33.626]  And we're going, if we're sheeple, we're going to line up, roll up our sleeves, present our children for vaccination the way 40 million Americans did in 10 weeks during the swine flu debacle in 1976.
[03:14:36.952 --> 03:15:03.601]  Only this time they won't stop it after 10 weeks, because the intention, we firmly believe, based on Holder's document and on other information that we've been amassing for years, and we've been talking about you, and the General and I have had the chance to talk about it on this show and on others, and we've been writing about it for years, is you have, this time, the intention is to get rid of us.
[03:15:03.601 --> 03:15:05.002]  Profitably.
[03:15:05.002 --> 03:15:06.302]  The amount of money
[03:15:06.880 --> 03:15:17.444]  That is being poured into the coffers of the world's pharmaceutical companies is absolutely unholy, as is the intent.
[03:15:17.444 --> 03:15:32.570]  In fact, today, the World Health Organization put out, I'm sorry, yesterday, World Health Organization put out a press release saying that what we need for this and the coming pandemic, because remember Alex,
[03:15:33.240 --> 03:15:37.144]  This vaccine is not the last pandemic vaccine.
[03:15:37.144 --> 03:15:43.270]  It's the first of many, many, many, many horrors to come until they've gotten rid of all of us.
[03:15:44.031 --> 03:15:45.692]  This is what's needed.
[03:15:45.692 --> 03:15:47.454]  We need many new vaccines.
[03:15:47.454 --> 03:15:48.695]  We need new patents.
[03:15:48.695 --> 03:15:50.016]  We need new drugs.
[03:15:50.016 --> 03:16:00.664]  Well, if you look how they ramp it up, they admittedly are testing global level six with all the major nation states under the direction of the World Health Organization, this global directorate.
[03:16:00.664 --> 03:16:06.868]  And so it's kind of like a Jim Jones Kool-Aid drinking drill, where they drill following orders and taking the poison.
[03:16:06.868 --> 03:16:11.612]  And they admit... I mean, you've looked at this, Doctor, and I want to get General Stubblebine's take on it.
[03:16:11.612 --> 03:16:12.713]  What is the history
[03:16:13.612 --> 03:16:15.512]  Actually, I believe the trials were done by Novartis.
[03:16:35.297 --> 03:16:52.519]  And I believe that they were in conjunction with Sinophia Ventis, the good people who manufactured an avian flu vaccine, which the United States bought a hundred million doses of in their first order, totally untested, untried, but approved by the FDA.
[03:16:52.699 --> 03:16:53.400]  Well, that's the thing.
[03:16:53.400 --> 03:16:56.903]  They're on our news here in Austin saying everybody's got to take the shot, get ready.
[03:16:56.903 --> 03:17:00.826]  They're on the news saying it will be mandatory coming up in the fall.
[03:17:00.826 --> 03:17:02.387]  It will be a pandemic.
[03:17:02.387 --> 03:17:04.029]  It will be mass death.
[03:17:04.029 --> 03:17:09.894]  And then people are lining up and they're saying, oh, we don't even know if this is the right thing and just taking the shot.
[03:17:09.894 --> 03:17:17.400]  What do we know from past operations, Dr. Labo and then General Stubblebine, about what they're putting in these vaccines?
[03:17:17.400 --> 03:17:19.141]  Well, they're putting adjuvants.
[03:17:19.141 --> 03:17:20.122]  Adjuvants are
[03:17:22.397 --> 03:17:32.487]  And the ones that we're most familiar with are the ones based on squalene, which is a fat ordinarily found in the nervous system.
[03:17:32.487 --> 03:17:39.654]  Now when you eat squalene or you rub it on your skin and it's used in a lot of cosmetics, it doesn't do anything bad to you.
[03:17:39.654 --> 03:17:45.119]  But if you inject it, it trains the immune system's white cells to attack it.
[03:17:45.635 --> 03:17:52.640]  Because it's a foreign object in your bloodstream at that point and the immune system is only doing its job.
[03:17:52.640 --> 03:17:59.406]  It turns on the immune system and the immune system's attack forces can never be turned off again.
[03:17:59.406 --> 03:18:04.970]  So they start attacking everything that looks biochemically like squalene.
[03:18:05.370 --> 03:18:12.656]  And then this, according to other doctors we've had on, accelerates the allergies, the sicknesses, the cancers, and then makes your immune system go haywire.
[03:18:12.656 --> 03:18:13.897]  I want to talk about that more.
[03:18:13.897 --> 03:18:15.159]  We're about to go to break.
[03:18:15.159 --> 03:18:26.468]  But General Stubblebine, you were just on six, seven months ago before this whole flu thing came up, and you guys were talking about when they try to launch a pandemic, don't take the shot.
[03:18:26.468 --> 03:18:28.050]  What does this look like to you?
[03:18:29.008 --> 03:18:33.412]  Well, it's very clear, you know, what Dr. Ream and I have been doing.
[03:18:33.412 --> 03:18:40.057]  Alex has been watching very carefully a whole lot of information.
[03:18:40.057 --> 03:18:51.967]  And I call them dots, they're tidbits of information, but it's part of the way I have been trained from the intelligence world, or in the intelligence world, of how you put the picture together.
[03:18:51.967 --> 03:18:55.090]  And what you do is you take little bits of information,
[03:18:56.330 --> 03:19:07.496]  For instance, 11 people died instantaneously in a trial in Poland, and then 22 more died later from the same vaccine that you're about to take.
[03:19:07.496 --> 03:19:20.942]  And then you take the information about Baxter, which contaminated the vaccines for 22 different countries, or 18 different countries in Europe.
[03:19:21.742 --> 03:19:27.628]  You put all of these various dots together like that, and what you end up with is a picture.
[03:19:27.628 --> 03:19:41.161]  Suddenly the picture flies into your face, and you say, holy smokes, now I take this to the people who are called operational folks, because they're the people that do the planning of what you do about it.
[03:19:41.909 --> 03:19:52.498]  So, the intelligence piece of all of this has been creating this enormous picture that you now have seen the documentation for.
[03:19:52.498 --> 03:19:53.359]  Stay there.
[03:19:53.359 --> 03:19:54.259]  We gotta break, General.
[03:19:54.259 --> 03:19:56.021]  Please come right back with this.
[03:19:56.021 --> 03:19:58.463]  And we'll get the doctor's comments on this.
[03:19:58.463 --> 03:19:59.003]  Absolutely.
[03:19:59.003 --> 03:20:01.565]  We now have the full textbook on how they're gonna kill us.
[03:20:01.565 --> 03:20:08.251]  Finally in the news this evening, it's being reported that cyber spies from Russia and China have now penetrated our power grid.
[03:20:08.671 --> 03:20:24.881]  Even as energy experts are reporting that each summer we get closer and closer to the limits of our nation's power grid, some say that this summer's demand for electrical power may finally push the grid over its edge, creating a cascade of power outages across the country, putting us all in the dark.
[03:20:24.881 --> 03:20:30.264]  Are you prepared for the next round of storm-related outages or government-created blackouts?
[03:20:30.264 --> 03:20:36.508]  Have you ever thought about taking steps to get off the grid and generate your own private supply of electrical power?
[03:20:36.988 --> 03:20:40.650]  So, this will be the most important information you have ever heard.
[03:20:40.650 --> 03:20:43.251]  Solar powered generators are finally available.
[03:20:43.251 --> 03:20:49.013]  They have no moving parts to wear out or break and require absolutely no gas whatsoever.
[03:20:49.013 --> 03:20:51.714]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[03:20:51.714 --> 03:20:53.915]  So go to MySolarBackup.com.
[03:20:53.915 --> 03:20:56.416]  That's MySolarBackup.com.
[03:20:56.416 --> 03:21:00.698]  Check out MySolarBackup.com before you lose your power.
[03:21:01.821 --> 03:21:07.624]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[03:21:07.624 --> 03:21:15.207]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[03:21:15.207 --> 03:21:21.370]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[03:21:21.790 --> 03:21:23.772]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[03:21:23.772 --> 03:21:26.274]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[03:21:26.274 --> 03:21:37.842]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[03:21:37.842 --> 03:21:39.524]  It's not about left or right.
[03:21:39.524 --> 03:21:41.385]  It's about a one-world government.
[03:21:41.385 --> 03:21:47.610]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[03:21:48.288 --> 03:21:56.553]  Get your copy of the Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:21:56.553 --> 03:21:58.114]  The Obama Deception.
[03:21:58.114 --> 03:21:59.315]  The people strike back!
[03:22:01.015 --> 03:22:01.556]  Good day.
[03:22:01.556 --> 03:22:03.157]  Jim Newcomer from Midas Resources.
[03:22:03.157 --> 03:22:03.498]  July 16, 2009.
[03:22:03.498 --> 03:22:04.499]  Gold opened this morning at $940.
[03:22:04.499 --> 03:22:07.482]  A one-ounce gold coin can be purchased for $966.96, $4348 for a half-ounce, or $241.74 for the quarter-ounce.
[03:22:07.482 --> 03:22:08.083]  That's $966.96, $483.48, or $241.74.
[03:22:18.735 --> 03:22:22.697]  Bailout equals market distortions, increased money supply while productivity is going down.
[03:22:22.697 --> 03:22:26.920]  Wall Street is receiving injections of liquidity while smaller companies are forced to concede.
[03:22:26.920 --> 03:22:31.562]  Companies too big to fail are now using the tax dollars to increase market share, paying fat dividends.
[03:22:31.562 --> 03:22:37.105]  Are you wondering why supplies of gold and silver coins are decreasing rapidly, leaving the public scrambling to accumulate what's left?
[03:22:37.105 --> 03:22:40.367]  Fiat currency's value is based on trust, fiscal responsibility.
[03:22:40.367 --> 03:22:45.150]  Is Congress and the White House acting responsibly, earning your trust, or is it time to ensure your hard-earned wealth?
[03:22:45.250 --> 03:22:48.512]  Midas Resources offers economic insurance, gold and silver coins, 800-686-2237.
[03:22:48.512 --> 03:22:53.235]  Do you believe that more bailout will solve our economic problems?
[03:22:53.235 --> 03:22:55.097]  Or would you like to call Midas Resources at 1-800-686-2237?
[03:22:55.097 --> 03:22:56.377]  That's Midas Resources at 1-800-686-2237.
[03:23:15.651 --> 03:23:17.215]  Have a glass of water.
[03:23:17.215 --> 03:23:21.766]  Can you taste the harmful chlorine, fluoride, lead, pharmaceutical drugs, and numerous others?
[03:23:23.612 --> 03:23:24.452]  We're good to go!
[03:23:48.117 --> 03:23:50.158]  There's a gun and ammunition just inside the doorway.
[03:23:50.158 --> 03:23:51.078]  Use it only in emergency.
[03:24:22.109 --> 03:24:35.260]  Obama's science advisor called for a planetary regime to enforce totalitarian population control, forced sterilization, forced abortion, euthanasia.
[03:24:36.630 --> 03:24:45.595]  Of course, drugging of the water supply, implantable chips, and this is Obama's science advisor, General Stubblebine, intelligence expert.
[03:24:45.595 --> 03:24:48.777]  Continuing, you got interrupted by the satellite break, there, had to take it.
[03:24:48.777 --> 03:24:59.943]  Continuing with the intelligence, you're saying you can see the history of the vaccine, the history of what they've done over and over again, the fear mongering, and so it's not the flu you worry about, it's the shot.
[03:24:59.943 --> 03:25:00.403]  Continue.
[03:25:00.896 --> 03:25:02.897]  That's absolutely correct.
[03:25:02.897 --> 03:25:11.281]  And as you begin to, as this picture suddenly pops into your face, Alex, you suddenly say, holy smokes!
[03:25:11.281 --> 03:25:12.501]  You know, I knew it was bad.
[03:25:12.501 --> 03:25:14.963]  I did not know it was that bad.
[03:25:14.963 --> 03:25:18.864]  Now, though, it's time to take action because you now know.
[03:25:18.864 --> 03:25:21.366]  And oh, by the way, the book that you've just gotten is
[03:25:22.506 --> 03:25:29.207]  Your confirmation that everything that we've been saying for months and months and months and months is absolutely true.
[03:25:29.207 --> 03:25:33.648]  And oh, by the way, during those months and months and months, people were saying we're crazy.
[03:25:33.648 --> 03:25:33.888]  We're nuts.
[03:25:33.888 --> 03:25:34.709]  We're off the wall.
[03:25:34.709 --> 03:25:39.070]  And that we work for Big Pharma, and that we're CIA agents, yadda yadda yadda yadda.
[03:25:39.070 --> 03:25:44.231]  The fact is, they didn't want to hear what we were saying, or they were on the other side.
[03:25:44.231 --> 03:25:44.851]  Ignore them.
[03:25:46.926 --> 03:26:09.720]  Yeah, well doctor, that's how COINTELPRO works, is that they can't believe we have a Ron Paul, they can't believe we have a General Stubblebine, they can't believe that there's good people from powerful positions that are stepping up, and that's what COINTELPRO does, but regardless, we're putting out the facts, we're doing the best we can, people can listen, or they can go ahead and take the shots.
[03:26:10.233 --> 03:26:18.837]  No, but at this stage of the game, they better goddamn listen, otherwise, excuse my language, but they better listen, otherwise, they're going to be in deep trouble.
[03:26:18.837 --> 03:26:28.541]  You have now seen, for a fact, I mean, you've believed all along, Alex, now you understand exactly because you've seen the document.
[03:26:28.541 --> 03:26:32.262]  You've seen the blueprint for what all of this is about.
[03:26:32.262 --> 03:26:35.604]  Let me read to you the CDC assumptions
[03:26:36.304 --> 03:26:42.067]  Yeah, they're saying for sure they know this, but with regular flu, they go, a million Americans have it, like we're all gonna die.
[03:26:42.067 --> 03:26:44.068]  That just means we have the virus, no big deal.
[03:26:44.068 --> 03:26:46.729]  They're clearly engaged in lying and fear-mongering.
[03:26:46.729 --> 03:26:47.830]  The question is why?
[03:27:06.514 --> 03:27:25.660]  Well, the answer is very simple, because the WHO has said for decades, and the United States government has accepted for decades, that their first priority for a, quote, sustainable planet is the same as the Illuminati and Bilderberger agenda, which is massive depopulation.
[03:27:25.660 --> 03:27:26.841]  The Georgia Guidestones
[03:27:27.521 --> 03:27:28.681]  Pretty well say it all.
[03:27:28.681 --> 03:27:38.564]  I don't know who put them up, I don't know what their deal was, but they do want to reduce the population by a minimum of 80% and a maximum of 90%.
[03:27:38.564 --> 03:27:43.306]  That means 9 out of every 10 humans on the planet is slated to go.
[03:27:43.306 --> 03:27:54.689]  But as long as we're going, they say, why don't we just pump untold amounts of the remaining money, such as it is, the worthless money that's been degraded,
[03:27:55.537 --> 03:28:00.740]  Uh, by the, if you will, the economic pandemic that's been engineered.
[03:28:00.740 --> 03:28:12.087]  Why don't we just pump all the remaining money into their hands through the diseases that they will cause and through the unbelievable amount of money that these vaccines are generating?
[03:28:12.287 --> 03:28:14.068]  Well, Doctor, we've got a long segment coming up.
[03:28:14.068 --> 03:28:20.672]  This was the short one, so we've got plenty of time for both you and General Stubblebine to break this down and what you're recommending we do and how we get this to the floor.
[03:28:20.672 --> 03:28:28.916]  You know, to say, look, we're not going to take forced injections because under the executive order that they've activated, as you know, the public may not.
[03:28:28.916 --> 03:28:34.339]  They're now saying forced inoculations under level six, quarantining, lockdown, basically code red.
[03:28:34.339 --> 03:28:40.003]  But General, briefly, a lot of the experts I've talked to, but you've been the former head of major intelligence divisions of the Army,
[03:28:40.723 --> 03:28:43.964]  And really wrote the book on a lot of the systems we see today.
[03:28:43.964 --> 03:28:57.248]  Looking at this, most experts I talked to said they won't want to kill most people right away with the shot, that it'll have a bad effect on some, and the soft kill will be an immediate kill with some, as we saw with trials in Poland and other areas.
[03:28:57.248 --> 03:29:07.311]  But a lot of experts are saying, buy an airy weapon, for those that don't know, meaning this gives you half of it, they then trigger through water or air, something else later.
[03:29:08.539 --> 03:29:12.382]  You know, we know pieces of what are in the vaccine.
[03:29:12.382 --> 03:29:16.946]  We absolutely do not know the entire menu that's in that vaccine.
[03:29:16.946 --> 03:29:37.622]  One thing is for sure, you can rest assured, since this vaccine is being put there on purpose to give you, as an excuse to give you the shot, you know that what's going to be in there and what's going to be in your body is not going to fit your body very nicely.
[03:29:38.122 --> 03:29:38.603]  Stay there.
[03:29:38.603 --> 03:29:40.425]  Stay there, Doctor.
[03:29:40.425 --> 03:29:40.905]  We got a break.
[03:29:40.905 --> 03:29:41.726]  Long segment coming up.
[03:29:41.726 --> 03:29:43.227]  General, stay there.
[03:29:43.227 --> 03:29:44.389]  Absolutely.
[03:29:44.389 --> 03:29:51.676]  And a lot of experts we've talked to, genetic engineers, say a lot of these cancer viruses they implant trigger later.
[03:29:51.676 --> 03:29:53.057]  We're on the march.
[03:29:53.057 --> 03:29:55.600]  The Empire's on the run.
[03:29:55.600 --> 03:29:58.263]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:01.069 --> 03:30:02.431]  This is Alex Jones.
[03:30:02.431 --> 03:30:04.453]  Have you heard of the Millionaire Patriot?
[03:30:04.453 --> 03:30:05.434]  Well, you should.
[03:30:05.434 --> 03:30:09.919]  He has a free handgun and five days of firearms training waiting for you.
[03:30:09.919 --> 03:30:10.720]  That's right.

[03:30:22.093 --> 03:30:28.076]  The Millionaire Patriot will give you a free Springfield Armory XD pistol in the caliber of your choice.
[03:30:28.076 --> 03:30:34.959]  I believe now is the time that you and your family need to be armed and trained to levels that exceed law enforcement and military standards.
[03:30:34.959 --> 03:30:40.141]  Front Sight provides such training without any boot camp mentality or drill instructor attitudes.

[03:31:01.428 --> 03:31:03.109]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[03:31:03.109 --> 03:31:06.070]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient.
[03:31:06.070 --> 03:31:07.850]  And today, that's more important than ever.
[03:31:07.850 --> 03:31:10.811]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.

[03:31:13.832 --> 03:31:18.574]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency.
[03:31:18.894 --> 03:31:19.174]  We're good.

[03:32:43.730 --> 03:32:49.112]  When using wireless hotspots, PatriotInternet.com shields your information from identity thieves.
[03:32:49.312 --> 03:32:49.712]  We're good.
[03:33:19.555 --> 03:33:25.799]  Ladies and gentlemen, this isn't a game or a joke that General Stubblebine was just saying.
[03:33:25.799 --> 03:33:31.684]  Okay, we've got General Stubblebine and his wife, Doctor...
[03:33:33.010 --> 03:33:35.471]  Rima Labo, you've got the floor here.
[03:33:35.471 --> 03:33:38.912]  Continue breaking down then, because you got interrupted by some breaks.
[03:33:38.912 --> 03:33:43.414]  Start over, break down the intelligence we have on these vaccines, what we know.
[03:33:43.414 --> 03:33:50.236]  I mean, it's just like Gardasil at Middle East, killing a whole bunch of women and girls, having weird autoimmune diseases with the others.
[03:33:50.236 --> 03:33:54.678]  We're almost like Ebola, where blood's coming out of all these orifices.
[03:33:54.678 --> 03:33:57.859]  It's paralyzing people, and it's like they're testing soft kills.
[03:33:58.499 --> 03:34:01.542]  Testing the media's response, testing the public.
[03:34:01.542 --> 03:34:11.650]  I don't know what you'd call that, General, in a military fashion, but just like before they invaded Panama, they would have the helicopters land and do drills for six months to where they were acclimated.
[03:34:11.650 --> 03:34:16.935]  So they just acclimate us now to the ambient soft kill, silent weapons, quiet wars.
[03:34:16.935 --> 03:34:23.761]  Let's get the General's take on that and then the doctor breaking down what she sees happening here, how we get Congress to say no
[03:34:24.301 --> 03:34:26.483]  And to, like, override the executive order?
[03:34:26.483 --> 03:34:29.586]  Because they've now engaged Level 6.
[03:34:29.586 --> 03:34:31.428]  The question is, will they implement?
[03:34:31.428 --> 03:34:43.340]  So, General, what do you call this soft-kill system where they're increasing the deadliness of the vaccines, openly killing us, death to the left, death to the right, and everyone just marching in, injecting their children?
[03:34:44.244 --> 03:35:00.093]  Well, I'm not sure that I know the military terminology for this kind of soft kill, but it's like guerrilla warfare, because it's kind of behind the scenes, it's hidden.
[03:35:00.093 --> 03:35:05.516]  You know, if you're doing guerrilla warfare, you cannot go out into the middle of the street
[03:35:05.836 --> 03:35:06.217]  We...
[03:35:24.958 --> 03:35:32.264]  No, you can just see them rolling out the total PSYOP for a non-event flu and then saying we're all basically dead in the fall.
[03:35:32.264 --> 03:35:38.790]  Take the shot with their history of radiating foster children, black men and syphilis, Project Shad.
[03:35:38.790 --> 03:35:41.873]  How would anyone in their right mind take anything they try to give us?
[03:35:42.113 --> 03:35:43.754]  They're not in their right mind, Alex.
[03:35:43.754 --> 03:35:44.934]  They've been propagandized.
[03:35:44.934 --> 03:35:49.236]  They've been propagandized, they've been fluoridated, they've been controlled.
[03:35:49.236 --> 03:35:55.818]  What percentage of the American population is on psychoactive medication and on electroshock therapy?
[03:35:55.818 --> 03:36:00.540]  It's horrendously high, and that means that people can be controlled.
[03:36:00.540 --> 03:36:04.821]  That's part of the soft kill, and it's been going on for a long, long time.
[03:36:04.821 --> 03:36:11.324]  I want to remind people that the very first vaccine, Edward Jenner's vaccine for smallpox,
[03:36:11.724 --> 03:36:17.246]  It was literally a vaccine for syphilis, because it spread syphilis.
[03:36:17.246 --> 03:36:33.172]  And by the mid-19th century, the British Parliament, which had made mandatory vaccination a law for every citizen and every resident of the British Empire, discovered that they had created a syphilis epidemic.
[03:36:33.172 --> 03:36:39.154]  So they did an investigation, they held an inquiry, and they discovered that they had two choices.
[03:36:39.154 --> 03:36:40.895]  Choice one, admit it.
[03:36:41.375 --> 03:36:57.960]  They would have egg all over their faces and take responsibility for the fact that they had killed and named and sentenced to death millions of people through this hastily entered into scientific fraud, which is what vaccination is, or do a cover-up.
[03:36:57.960 --> 03:36:59.600]  They did a cover-up, of course.
[03:36:59.600 --> 03:37:06.062]  They chose a cover-up and they doubled Edward Jenner's lifelong stipend from £10,000, I think this was about 1853, to £20,000.
[03:37:10.203 --> 03:37:17.749]  Saying, oh, there's nothing wrong here, look, look, we've done the right thing through stealth, deceit, fraud, and lies.
[03:37:17.749 --> 03:37:22.353]  But wasn't that just a Malthusian first round of eugenics through Mr. Galton?
[03:37:22.353 --> 03:37:36.305]  No, I believe that in fact this was a colossal, stupendous stupidity on the part of the British Parliament, and that they chose to save their own egos and careers rather than back down
[03:37:37.153 --> 03:37:39.654]  Well, look at the 76 swine flu.
[03:37:39.654 --> 03:37:46.837]  This always breaks out, the 1918, the 1976, it's always breaking out at military bases.
[03:37:46.837 --> 03:37:50.799]  Oddly enough, where our soldiers are our guinea pigs.
[03:37:50.799 --> 03:38:02.583]  Guess who gets to hold up their arm, or unclothe their arm, and stand there and stick it out so that somebody will stick a needle in it?
[03:38:02.583 --> 03:38:03.964]  And they have no choice.
[03:38:04.304 --> 03:38:19.151]  Same with Vaccine A. And I want to point out, I want to point out that the same information that Gary Matsumoto so beautifully brought forward in his Vaccine A and the subtitle of that book was why the United States is
[03:38:20.011 --> 03:38:23.872]  ...experimenting on the military and why they won't be the last.
[03:38:23.872 --> 03:38:26.913]  He talked about squalene adjuvants.
[03:38:26.913 --> 03:38:33.875]  He talked about introducing oils that irritate the immune system so they make more antibodies.
[03:38:33.875 --> 03:38:43.677]  That means the expensive part of the vaccine, the antigen, can be in much, much, much smaller proportions so it's more profitable for the company.
[03:38:43.677 --> 03:38:46.518]  And then you make more antigens.
[03:38:46.949 --> 03:38:51.112]  That means that you have a higher antigen titer in your body.
[03:38:51.112 --> 03:38:56.256]  So it's that accelerant that triggers the autoimmune response you're saying.
[03:38:56.256 --> 03:39:04.723]  The other medical doctors we've had on have said that's the thing that's causing a lot of the autism, not even the mercury, is that it causes that brain swelling that then causes brain damage.
[03:39:04.723 --> 03:39:07.005]  Correctly, but there's another part to this.
[03:39:07.005 --> 03:39:13.110]  No one, and I say this as a scientist and as a physician, no one has ever proven
[03:39:14.085 --> 03:39:25.436]  In any clinical trial whatsoever, that that high titer, that high level of antibodies is related in any way with immunity to the disease.
[03:39:25.436 --> 03:39:25.676]  Ever.
[03:39:25.676 --> 03:39:28.379]  So this whole thing is pointless, you understand?
[03:39:28.379 --> 03:39:29.820]  It's quackery, it's quackery.
[03:39:29.820 --> 03:39:31.381]  Total quackery.
[03:39:31.381 --> 03:39:35.946]  Okay, doctor and general, from a military perspective, intelligence perspective, from a medical doctor perspective,
[03:39:37.372 --> 03:39:50.719]  You've got all these deaths all over Europe and Asia in swine flu and bird flu trials, high death rates where they inject a hundred people in it, you know, a whole bunch of them drop dead, and we've been putting mainstream news articles on screen, and then the media is very quiet.
[03:39:50.719 --> 03:39:57.423]  The government even indicts people who gave the shots, saying they were paid by pharmaceutical companies, but then we can't ever find who they are.
[03:39:58.343 --> 03:40:01.105]  And then we've got Baxter involved in the new vaccine.
[03:40:01.105 --> 03:40:01.765]  They're involved.
[03:40:01.765 --> 03:40:04.006]  I mean, what does this look like to you?
[03:40:04.006 --> 03:40:10.270]  And then how are you coming out and saying, look out with this next flu shot that's coming out?
[03:40:10.270 --> 03:40:13.412]  Um, it looks... No, let me answer that first.
[03:40:13.412 --> 03:40:14.272]  Okay, General.
[03:40:14.272 --> 03:40:15.273]  I'll tell you what.
[03:40:15.273 --> 03:40:16.614]  It looks like an ambush.
[03:40:17.458 --> 03:40:30.166]  You know, if you're in a city or a town and you're going door to door in fighting, you never know where the ambush is going to come from.
[03:40:30.166 --> 03:40:31.767]  Is it going to come from a roof?
[03:40:31.767 --> 03:40:32.668]  From a window?
[03:40:32.668 --> 03:40:33.588]  From a door?
[03:40:33.588 --> 03:40:34.869]  From behind a door?
[03:40:34.869 --> 03:40:36.310]  You don't know!
[03:40:36.310 --> 03:40:39.192]  And this whole thing, Alex,
[03:40:40.617 --> 03:40:49.189]  To me, it looks exactly like that door-to-door fighting in towns called ambush.
[03:40:49.189 --> 03:40:49.850]  Ambush.
[03:40:49.850 --> 03:40:50.711]  That's what it is.
[03:40:50.711 --> 03:40:55.198]  But this time the ambush is by our own forces against our own people.
[03:40:55.629 --> 03:40:58.071]  Well, we can see that the whole thing's engineered.
[03:40:58.071 --> 03:41:05.997]  We can see it's all hype and the vaccine's deadly and they admit won't even protect you from it and normally flus mutate into something less harmful or harmless.
[03:41:05.997 --> 03:41:10.061]  How are they saying 100% it's going to mutate deadly in the fall?
[03:41:10.061 --> 03:41:11.222]  Now, we're not saying that's going to happen.
[03:41:11.222 --> 03:41:12.122]  They're saying it.
[03:41:12.122 --> 03:41:19.248]  I mean, for anybody with a scientific background, doctor, in general, it's 101 that they can't say they know it's going to be deadly.
[03:41:19.248 --> 03:41:20.869]  That clearly is a lie.
[03:41:20.869 --> 03:41:23.492]  So it means that they know something we don't know.
[03:41:23.492 --> 03:41:24.793]  Are they going to release something else?
[03:41:25.438 --> 03:41:29.641]  It's a lie unless they know something that has never been told to the public.
[03:41:29.641 --> 03:41:34.464]  Well, now, I want to avoid giving these idiots too much credit.
[03:41:34.464 --> 03:41:36.045]  SARS fizzled.
[03:41:36.045 --> 03:41:38.026]  Avian flu fizzled.
[03:41:38.026 --> 03:41:41.508]  The pandemic swine flu fizzled.
[03:41:41.508 --> 03:41:47.892]  They may or may not be able to get the next generation of this
[03:41:48.511 --> 03:42:00.435]  Uh, this virus, this genetically engineered virus, to do what they want, which is kill lots of us, but it doesn't matter because they've got the vaccine, which is much more direct, much more effective.
[03:42:00.435 --> 03:42:01.655]  Now, listen up, folks.
[03:42:01.655 --> 03:42:02.875]  Which is the ambush.
[03:42:02.875 --> 03:42:03.936]  Which is the ambush.
[03:42:03.936 --> 03:42:14.819]  If a single person, and by the way, let me, let me reiterate, I was starting to read this before, the first target is children from kindergarten to twelfth grade.
[03:42:15.519 --> 03:42:19.022]  The second target is pregnant women.
[03:42:19.022 --> 03:42:24.466]  The third target is adults between 45 and 65.
[03:42:24.466 --> 03:42:29.150]  That's the most productive segment of the workforce.
[03:42:29.150 --> 03:42:33.874]  These are the people who are going to receive the vaccines, and there are many of them.
[03:42:33.874 --> 03:42:36.276]  Just to back you up, we're putting it on screen, Doctor.
[03:42:36.276 --> 03:42:38.357]  She's not just saying this.
[03:42:38.357 --> 03:42:39.618]  The news is announced.
[03:42:39.618 --> 03:42:42.320]  Children first, then the elderly, then the sick.
[03:42:42.320 --> 03:42:44.262]  These are the most vulnerable, and they admit...
[03:42:45.657 --> 03:42:46.979]  Go ahead, I'm gonna... Go ahead.
[03:42:56.400 --> 03:43:10.310]  Gardasil does what I believe Gardasil does and Cervavax, which is the British equivalent of Gardasil, which is about to be also approved in the United States shortly.
[03:43:10.310 --> 03:43:15.854]  If these two vaccines do what I believe, which is render girls infertile,
[03:43:16.534 --> 03:43:41.098]  There's no reason to believe, oh yes, there's no reason to believe that this new vaccine, for which Baxter applied for the patent in 2007, by the way, so this surprise rush to get things on the street, so to speak, is total hype and nonsense because they've been preparing this since 2007.
[03:43:41.098 --> 03:43:44.019]  If it does the same thing and it contains one of the
[03:43:44.019 --> 03:43:44.439]  Let me stop you.
[03:44:03.441 --> 03:44:20.809]  Doctor, my gut from all these hundreds of pieces that the General talks about is sterilization, because that's in the State Department memorandum 200, that's in the White House Czar's internal textbook plan report, and we know with the tetanus shots in Africa, Asia, and India, they got caught in the mid-90s.
[03:44:20.809 --> 03:44:22.250]  This is mainstream news for those that don't know.
[03:44:22.250 --> 03:44:22.730]  I know you know.
[03:44:23.590 --> 03:44:37.282]  Adding a hormone to the tetanus shot to then cause an autoimmune response to that hormone and then basically sterilize women by abortion, where every time they get pregnant the baby dies second trimester from that hormone situation.
[03:44:37.282 --> 03:44:49.112]  And by the way, that same system which was created by the World Health Organization through its task force on female sterilization through inoculation, that
[03:44:49.676 --> 03:44:58.390]  The same substance is available as a one-year birth control shot for women and girls in the United States.
[03:44:58.390 --> 03:44:59.592]  Just thought I'd throw that in.
[03:45:01.164 --> 03:45:02.565]  Well, I've seen U.S.
[03:45:02.565 --> 03:45:06.849]  programs and TV ads where they tell girls get your tetanus shot.
[03:45:06.849 --> 03:45:07.549]  It's obvious!
[03:45:07.549 --> 03:45:25.204]  I mean, Dr., I want you to keep breaking down the math and the science and the facts and the key, pens and paper ready, the websites for folks so people can get involved with Congress saying, now, we're not going to quarantine, we're not taking your shots, let us stay in our homes, don't make the Army drag us off.
[03:45:25.204 --> 03:45:28.867]  But, General, speaking to the military and the police, back in 2002 with the
[03:45:31.010 --> 03:45:32.771]  Model States Health Emergency Powers Act.
[03:45:32.771 --> 03:45:35.833]  You know they ordered first responders to take it, and the news reported L.A.
[03:45:35.833 --> 03:45:37.654]  Times over 99% said no.
[03:45:37.654 --> 03:45:39.496]  So the military and police aren't stupid.
[03:45:39.496 --> 03:45:42.418]  They even had bases saying no, even though they were ordering them to.
[03:45:42.418 --> 03:45:46.600]  But the firemen, the police, the doctors, Tommy Thompson said no.
[03:45:46.600 --> 03:45:50.523]  Health and Human Services said... I mean, the basic psychology.
[03:45:50.523 --> 03:45:51.764]  This attacks all of us.
[03:45:51.764 --> 03:45:55.346]  It's a very tiny eugenicist elite doing this.
[03:45:55.346 --> 03:45:58.268]  So we need to get the message out to the enforcers, too.
[03:45:58.268 --> 03:45:59.909]  Why would they want to serve this evil
[03:46:01.911 --> 03:46:09.034]  I mean, can you comment to this phenomenon of the very people being killed by this are the very ones that are going to be enforcing it?
[03:46:09.034 --> 03:46:20.860]  Well, a lot of that is simply because once you enter into the military, you know, the answer is yes sir, yes sir, no sir, yes sir.
[03:46:20.860 --> 03:46:24.742]  And everybody does exactly what they're told to do.
[03:46:24.742 --> 03:46:29.825]  So if the people at the very, very top know, but the people
[03:46:30.665 --> 03:46:31.946]  It's very, very difficult to
[03:46:52.561 --> 03:46:57.563]  Also, then go to the internet, go to the, uh, it's not in the papers.
[03:46:57.563 --> 03:46:59.944]  So where do they get their information?
[03:46:59.944 --> 03:47:03.965]  They've got to wake up almost all by themselves.
[03:47:03.965 --> 03:47:06.186]  A very difficult thing to do.
[03:47:06.186 --> 03:47:13.888]  And the people who are putting out the information, Alex, and there's a small community of us, are attacked by this COINTELPRO nonsense.
[03:47:13.888 --> 03:47:21.031]  And then people who want to do the right thing, who want to inform themselves, say, well, I better stay away from him, I better stay away from her.
[03:47:21.451 --> 03:47:22.452]  I better stay away from them.
[03:47:22.452 --> 03:47:24.052]  That's done to destroy our community.
[03:47:24.052 --> 03:47:36.938]  The last thing the new order would do would be to have you guys out putting out nothing but accurate info and warning people they would have you out saying it wasn't true and again they do this to balkanize us, they do this to break up our base.
[03:47:36.938 --> 03:47:42.821]  I have a 2004 army manual that's declassified on how to do this to indigenous groups.
[03:47:42.821 --> 03:47:43.801]  Exactly.
[03:47:43.801 --> 03:47:49.604]  Now I want to give you the action step and if you don't take this and if you don't
[03:47:50.363 --> 03:47:50.944]  I don't
[03:48:05.784 --> 03:48:08.266]  Or go into detention.
[03:48:08.266 --> 03:48:11.847]  Remember that you had the choice and you didn't take it.
[03:48:11.847 --> 03:48:18.471]  I want you to go to www.healthfreedomusa.org.
[03:48:18.471 --> 03:48:20.372]  On the right hand side it says Act Now.
[03:48:20.912 --> 03:48:23.295]  Now, click on the first button.
[03:48:23.295 --> 03:48:31.664]  Tell legislators you want the right to self-quarantine, not forced vaccinations, and not forced incarceration.
[03:48:31.664 --> 03:48:32.586]  Take that.
[03:48:32.586 --> 03:48:37.891]  Every member of your family gets to send in one of those action items.
[03:48:37.891 --> 03:48:39.994]  If your kids are too young, fill in their names.
[03:48:39.994 --> 03:48:40.815]  That's legitimate.
[03:48:41.514 --> 03:48:48.700]  What's happening is that Congress is getting bombarded with hundreds of thousands of these, and so is every state legislator in the country.
[03:48:48.700 --> 03:48:50.402]  But we need millions, not hundreds of thousands.
[03:48:50.402 --> 03:48:52.544]  We need millions, not hundreds of thousands.
[03:48:52.544 --> 03:48:55.546]  And what this is saying is, oh no you don't.
[03:48:55.546 --> 03:48:56.747]  This is pushback.
[03:48:56.747 --> 03:49:04.234]  Because remember, a lot of state legislators and a lot of congressmen don't have the information you do.
[03:49:04.674 --> 03:49:11.138]  So instead of arguing with them about vaccines are good, vaccines are bad, the WHO is the new world order, forget that.
[03:49:11.138 --> 03:49:14.120]  What we're saying is, I want a third pass.
[03:49:14.120 --> 03:49:16.381]  Pass one, take the shot.
[03:49:16.381 --> 03:49:21.504]  Pass two, accept incarceration in state or federal facilities.
[03:49:21.504 --> 03:49:25.846]  Pass three, I go into my house, I shut the door, I stay there.
[03:49:25.846 --> 03:49:27.567]  And yeah, the kids might get bored.
[03:49:27.567 --> 03:49:28.748]  Get them some extra books.
[03:49:30.390 --> 03:49:33.117]  The last place you want to go during a pandemic is some big mass camp.
[03:49:39.022 --> 03:49:42.583]  Absolutely want to stay out of them!
[03:49:42.583 --> 03:50:01.510]  Now let me take you back to the videos of the 500,000, which is only a small part, the 500,000 three-person disposable caskets that are stockpiled outside of Atlanta, and we know that they're stockpiled... Alabama, Georgia, Texas, Colorado, they're everywhere.
[03:50:02.310 --> 03:50:19.089]  Right now, let me take you back to the mass grave sites which have been purchased and are being prepared in upstate New York and in virtually every... No, we got the official state documents telling the cemeteries, don't tell anybody, can you bury 200,000 people on your little plot?
[03:50:19.089 --> 03:50:20.090]  We have the document.
[03:50:20.570 --> 03:50:22.431]  And you won't even get your own coffin!
[03:50:22.431 --> 03:50:25.391]  And now ask yourself, what's that for?
[03:50:25.391 --> 03:50:28.272]  Is that when I die from the vaccine?
[03:50:28.272 --> 03:50:31.393]  Is that when I die from the secondary soft kill?
[03:50:31.393 --> 03:50:38.475]  Because a lot of these vaccines are being produced on simian cells that we know contain leukemia viruses.
[03:50:39.768 --> 03:50:40.909]  Is that what you want?
[03:50:40.909 --> 03:50:45.491]  Just like SV40, they admitted it had cancer viruses and over 100 million Americans got it.
[03:50:45.491 --> 03:50:46.412]  This is unbelievable.
[03:50:46.412 --> 03:50:49.493]  General Stubblebine's our guest, Dr. Lebo's our guest.
[03:50:49.493 --> 03:50:54.916]  This is just blowing me away and they're openly announcing mass graves, martial law.
[03:50:54.916 --> 03:50:56.817]  It doesn't mean it's gonna happen.
[03:50:56.817 --> 03:50:58.178]  This could just be a beta test.
[03:50:58.178 --> 03:50:59.979]  We gotta take it very, very serious.
[03:51:04.662 --> 03:51:09.188]  If you owe the IRS, you can't make the problem go away without professional help.
[03:51:09.188 --> 03:51:12.552]  But with the help of Dan Pilla, you can get your problem solved.
[03:51:12.552 --> 03:51:17.419]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla, and I've been solving tax debt problems for 30 years, and I can help you too.
[03:51:17.419 --> 03:51:22.045]  We can stabilize IRS collection action and get your tax debt reduced, sometimes completely eliminated.
[03:51:22.566 --> 03:51:34.420]  And if you received a 1099 from a bank because of mortgage or other debt forgiveness, the vast majority of the time, I can show you how to completely erase it so you pay no taxes on what the IRS will consider to be taxable income.
[03:51:34.420 --> 03:51:37.243]  Call us for a free consultation to discuss the many possibilities.
[03:51:37.723 --> 03:51:40.946]  Call 1-800-34-NO-TAX.
[03:51:40.946 --> 03:51:44.288]  That's 800-34-N-O-T-A-X.

[03:51:47.390 --> 03:51:52.694]  Dan Pilla has been protecting taxpayers from the IRS for three decades, and he can help you.
[03:51:52.694 --> 03:51:53.675]  Call us today, 800-346-6829.
[03:51:53.675 --> 03:51:54.175]  That's 800-34-NO-TAX.
[03:51:54.175 --> 03:51:55.776]  It is a big idea.
[03:51:55.776 --> 03:51:56.557]  A new world order.
[03:52:06.710 --> 03:52:11.593]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[03:52:11.593 --> 03:52:14.435]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[03:52:14.435 --> 03:52:17.217]  Could their objective be world domination?
[03:52:17.217 --> 03:52:20.398]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[03:52:20.398 --> 03:52:30.765]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[03:52:30.765 --> 03:52:35.708]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[03:52:36.201 --> 03:52:40.045]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order Agenda.
[03:52:40.045 --> 03:52:42.627]  Global Parity is making great progress toward a world government.
[03:52:42.627 --> 03:52:43.788]  Most people have no idea.
[03:52:43.788 --> 03:52:44.589]  They're not after money.
[03:52:44.589 --> 03:52:45.871]  They have all the money they need.
[03:52:45.871 --> 03:52:46.831]  They're after power.
[03:52:46.831 --> 03:52:47.993]  That's their aphrodisiac.
[03:52:47.993 --> 03:52:52.757]  Order Endgame on DVD at PrisonPlanet.com or InfoWars.com.

[03:52:59.504 --> 03:53:00.585]  You have been warned.
[03:53:01.741 --> 03:53:05.623]  Berkey water systems are the most trusted name in water filtration available on the market.
[03:53:05.623 --> 03:53:22.613]  The revolutionary Berkey Light self-sterilizing and recleanable purification elements purify water by removing pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites to non-detectable levels and by extracting harmful chemicals such as herbicides, pesticides, VOCs, organic solvents, radon-222, and trihalomethanes.
[03:53:22.933 --> 03:53:28.017]  They also reduce nitrates, nitrites, sediment, and unhealthy minerals such as lead and mercury.

[03:53:52.455 --> 03:53:53.476]  I'm gonna do 10 minutes of overdrive.
[03:53:53.476 --> 03:53:54.377]  I just decided to do it.
[03:54:12.756 --> 03:54:13.977]  For the sake of getting truth out, you got it!
[03:54:13.977 --> 03:54:14.837]  You bet your bottom dollar!
[03:54:14.837 --> 03:54:18.019]  And I want to share something with you that just came into my email box, Alex.
[03:54:40.365 --> 03:54:54.750]  It seems that there is a health reform bill, a health care bill, which will fund state vaccine teams to conduct interventions, quote, quote, in private homes.
[03:54:54.750 --> 03:54:58.172]  Now, this bill says that it will, uh,
[03:54:59.722 --> 03:55:00.182]  We're good.
[03:55:16.167 --> 03:55:17.227]  Yes, here's the article.
[03:55:17.227 --> 03:55:20.448]  They're now going to send CPS to adult and children's homes.
[03:55:20.448 --> 03:55:21.509]  Cyber news service.
[03:55:21.509 --> 03:55:22.529]  Very credible.
[03:55:22.529 --> 03:55:23.830]  They have links to the documents.
[03:55:23.830 --> 03:55:24.970]  Zoom in on this.
[03:55:24.970 --> 03:55:27.511]  This ties into the FEMA camp bill.
[03:55:27.511 --> 03:55:28.791]  Zoom in on this for folks.
[03:55:28.791 --> 03:55:29.712]  I meant to get to this.
[03:55:29.712 --> 03:55:31.732]  This is the type of news I have stacked up.
[03:55:31.732 --> 03:55:34.993]  This is up on InfoWars.com right now.
[03:55:34.993 --> 03:55:36.314]  Healthcare bill.
[03:55:36.954 --> 03:55:41.277]  We'll fund state vaccine teams to conduct interventions in private homes.
[03:55:41.277 --> 03:55:46.420]  So they're now preparing to make everything mandatory, just like Rick Perry saying it's the law.
[03:55:46.420 --> 03:55:52.283]  You've got to take Gardasil when it killed a bunch of girls and women in the trials and is still killing people.
[03:55:52.283 --> 03:55:57.086]  General Stubblebine, in plain view, they're now making people take things that kill them.
[03:55:59.537 --> 03:56:06.781]  Well, the answer to that is yes, and look at all of the soldiers who step up in the line and say, yeah, shoot me.
[03:56:06.781 --> 03:56:09.602]  You know, shoot me with a shot or shoot me with a shotgun.
[03:56:09.602 --> 03:56:12.303]  And once again, get court-martialed if they don't.
[03:56:12.303 --> 03:56:13.424]  I'm going to say it again, Alex.
[03:56:14.384 --> 03:56:32.535]  Listen folks, get a pen, get a pencil, if you're on the internet right now, type in to the address bar www.healthfreedomusa.org.
[03:56:32.535 --> 03:56:34.776]  You'll see Act Now.
[03:56:34.776 --> 03:56:41.300]  Click on the first item to tell people who can make the difference, who can respond
[03:56:41.360 --> 03:56:47.404]  That's why they've been GPSing everybody's doors and they've now admitted it's for the quarantines.
[03:56:47.404 --> 03:56:51.867]  General, isn't this just the perfect cover even if they don't launch a bio-attack?
[03:56:51.867 --> 03:56:53.888]  The perfect cover for martial law and federalization.
[03:57:08.971 --> 03:57:09.611]  Absolutely.
[03:57:09.611 --> 03:57:20.959]  They find, incidentally, I had forgotten for a moment the fact that they know where every door is, where every family lives, so they can go to that door.
[03:57:20.959 --> 03:57:28.764]  If you've decided not to take a shot, they can go knock on your door and say, well, now just give me your arm here.
[03:57:28.764 --> 03:57:29.424]  Let me explain that
[03:57:32.686 --> 03:57:34.727]  They have targeted children first.
[03:57:34.727 --> 03:57:44.052]  Let me also remind you, and you may be one of the people who actually had this happen, that the CDC has been calling people.
[03:57:44.052 --> 03:57:47.114]  The CDC is a unit of the Health and Human Services.
[03:57:47.114 --> 03:57:48.114]  Yeah, we confirmed that.
[03:57:48.114 --> 03:57:49.595]  Asking if their vaccines are up to date.
[03:57:49.595 --> 03:57:54.057]  I'm getting all these calls from listeners and I googled it and I saw a news article where they are calling.
[03:57:55.798 --> 03:57:57.019]  It's actually happening.
[03:57:57.019 --> 03:57:57.380]  Stay there.
[03:57:57.380 --> 03:57:58.721]  We're talking about we're going to overdrive.
[03:57:58.721 --> 03:58:01.703]  It's a one-minute break, General and Doctor.
[03:58:01.703 --> 03:58:05.005]  One-minute break as we end the main radio show and then internet only.
[03:58:05.005 --> 03:58:12.491]  PrisonPlanet.tv viewers will be able to see it and all the tens of thousands listening right now on the internet streams at InfoWars.com.
[03:58:12.491 --> 03:58:20.798]  But when this video gets posted as an archive at PrisonPlanet.tv later in the day, not just a live stream, everybody get it out everywhere because
[03:58:22.173 --> 03:58:24.395]  It's worse than I even consciously know.
[03:58:24.395 --> 03:58:27.677]  As they mention other issues, I know it's all true.
[03:58:27.677 --> 03:58:29.899]  And just more pieces come in.
[03:58:29.899 --> 03:58:30.860]  This is eugenics.
[03:58:30.860 --> 03:58:35.203]  The White House chief admits it in his book, Ecoscience.
[03:58:35.203 --> 03:58:36.644]  They are killing us.
[03:58:36.644 --> 03:58:37.885]  This is real.
[03:58:37.885 --> 03:58:38.486]  Stay with us.
[03:58:38.486 --> 03:58:39.467]  Back in 60 seconds.
[03:58:39.467 --> 03:58:43.730]  Infowars.com.

[03:58:51.291 --> 03:58:57.134]  This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you again about a company that has supported us in the truth movement for years.
[03:58:57.134 --> 03:58:58.454]  Inner Health Botanicals.
[03:58:58.454 --> 03:59:02.716]  This company produces the highest quality superfood around, called Inner Food.
[03:59:02.716 --> 03:59:04.577]  My wife just loves the stuff.
[03:59:04.577 --> 03:59:10.900]  And now, the health ranger Mike Adams has awarded Inner Food his Editor's Choice Award for Best Superfood of 2009.
[03:59:12.020 --> 03:59:14.882]  Inner Food is loaded with 20 great organic ingredients.
[03:59:14.882 --> 03:59:16.623]  No fillers, no sweeteners.
[03:59:16.623 --> 03:59:19.645]  It would be impossible to blend this up for a better price.
[03:59:19.645 --> 03:59:21.347]  And their formula really works.
[03:59:21.347 --> 03:59:24.169]  This is the real thing for the great health you need.
[03:59:24.169 --> 03:59:25.650]  Try the NutriCafe.
[03:59:25.650 --> 03:59:30.433]  Their great organic coffee infused with polysaccharides that boost the immune system.
[03:59:30.433 --> 03:59:32.855]  A truly healthy coffee that tastes great.
[03:59:32.855 --> 03:59:35.317]  And take it from me folks, it really does taste great.
[03:59:35.317 --> 03:59:37.058]  Don't forget to try their other great products.

[03:59:54.287 --> 03:59:56.988]  This is the GCN Radio Network.
[03:59:56.988 --> 03:59:58.909]  Home to hard-hitting talk radio.
[04:00:14.357 --> 04:00:14.758]  We're good.
[04:00:25.327 --> 04:00:32.653]  They want you dead, ladies and gentlemen, as the White Houses are over science states and wrote a textbook on how to do it.
[04:00:32.653 --> 04:00:35.895]  You read that textbook, it's exactly what they're doing.
[04:00:35.895 --> 04:00:38.637]  We got Major General retired Stubblebine.
[04:00:38.637 --> 04:00:47.244]  We have his accomplished wife, Dr. Rima Labo, who's even treated heads of state, who openly talk about, yeah, it is the plan to kill everybody.
[04:00:47.244 --> 04:00:49.606]  This is serious business.
[04:00:50.179 --> 04:00:52.939]  This is serious business and I want to make a point.
[04:00:52.939 --> 04:00:58.020]  There is an internet petition going around which has all the right moves, so to speak.
[04:00:58.020 --> 04:00:59.601]  It says really good things.
[04:00:59.601 --> 04:01:01.121]  I agree with everything it says.
[04:01:01.121 --> 04:01:03.421]  It's completely useless.
[04:01:03.421 --> 04:01:18.324]  We have contacted the people who put it out and we said, look, this has no political meaning and right now the only solution that's going to keep us from these damn needles killing us now or slowly is a political solution.
[04:01:18.784 --> 04:01:20.084]  We need a political solution.
[04:01:20.084 --> 04:01:38.649]  We need to make a stink, too, and let people know they don't have to take these shots, but we just... In the few minutes we have left here, though, and I want to give out the website and the letter and the phone numbers that you want people to call and specifics for what you want them to tell Congress when they call, but we just ended the last hour with General Stubblebine and yourself
[04:01:39.409 --> 04:01:46.510]  Talking about how it is in the news, the CDC's calling and saying, have you had your shots when there's no law to take them?
[04:01:46.510 --> 04:01:55.712]  So they're using the pandemic fear over this one flu, and it says there, it's actually in the news, they're asking, has your daughter had her genital wart shot?
[04:01:55.712 --> 04:01:58.392]  Have you had your chicken pox shot?
[04:01:58.392 --> 04:02:01.553]  And then now they say they're going to go to your door.
[04:02:01.553 --> 04:02:05.134]  I mean, this is worse than the Soviet Union or Nazi Germany.
[04:02:05.134 --> 04:02:06.634]  General Stolbein, your take on this.
[04:02:08.628 --> 04:02:11.749]  Very simple.
[04:02:11.749 --> 04:02:13.650]  Let me back off for one second.
[04:02:13.650 --> 04:02:21.492]  In every strategy, in every kind of military operation, you have a primary attack and you have secondary attacks.
[04:02:21.492 --> 04:02:25.473]  Right now, the primary attack looks to be like the vaccines.
[04:02:25.473 --> 04:02:31.235]  All of these other pieces are the secondary attacks or the preparations for the main attack.
[04:02:31.235 --> 04:02:33.395]  The main attack is coming.
[04:02:33.395 --> 04:02:34.775]  Let there be no doubt about it.
[04:02:36.856 --> 04:02:43.143]  ...gone around and they have, literally from satellites, have taken pictures of your front door so they know where you are.
[04:02:43.143 --> 04:02:50.131]  They know your phone number, you know their name, and now they're asking the questions of, oh by the way, are you up to date on all your shots?
[04:02:50.131 --> 04:02:51.173]  Why would they do that?
[04:02:51.893 --> 04:02:55.956]  Unless they had somebody who was going to come to your door and give you a shot.
[04:03:09.747 --> 04:03:20.575]  Whether or not you've had the shots, I mean, this is un... and they've got all these TV shows, General, with this preparatory phase of, there's going to be a pandemic, do what the military says.
[04:03:20.575 --> 04:03:33.505]  I mean, they're really drilling the public consciousness, and you're saying, you're saying, looking at the pieces, General, you think they're getting ready to really red light things, and, I mean, green light things, and that this is the real deal.
[04:03:33.505 --> 04:03:35.387]  This is coming as well.
[04:03:35.387 --> 04:03:39.430]  We want to make it a red light, and that's what pushback does, Alex.
[04:03:40.043 --> 04:03:42.428]  And let me tell you what, let's get to principles of war.
[04:03:42.428 --> 04:03:49.480]  One of the principles of war, and one of the most important principles of war is called math.
[04:03:51.244 --> 04:03:58.167]  You need to put together the largest force that you can do that totally overwhelms the other side.
[04:03:58.167 --> 04:04:01.728]  Right now, they have got the mass.
[04:04:01.728 --> 04:04:05.689]  We have got the mass in people, but they have been silent.
[04:04:05.689 --> 04:04:10.391]  They have now got to get up on their high legs and make noise.
[04:04:10.391 --> 04:04:11.452]  All of them.
[04:04:11.452 --> 04:04:12.172]  All of the people.
[04:04:12.612 --> 04:04:38.318]  In this nation, and got to get, take the action that Dr. Rima talked about before, www.healthfreedomusa.org, and go to the action now column on the right hand side, and make sure that your voices, all of your voices, are heard in Congress, and in the state, and at the federal level, and in all of the agencies.
[04:04:38.318 --> 04:04:39.658]  You've got to do that.
[04:04:39.918 --> 04:04:57.420]  Not one person listening to your show, Alex, should be unaware of the fact that both state and federal statutes say that if you don't accept a mandatory vaccine in time of pandemic, you will be involuntarily quarantined and incarcerated.
[04:04:57.580 --> 04:05:02.322]  Yes, that's the official executive order and the statutes right now.
[04:05:02.322 --> 04:05:05.663]  They can drag you and your family away, put whatever they want in your body.
[04:05:05.663 --> 04:05:07.163]  Folks, this is tyranny.
[04:05:07.163 --> 04:05:08.764]  They've got a history of eugenics.
[04:05:08.764 --> 04:05:14.265]  The White House chief is a eugenicist calling for our sterilization and deaths.
[04:05:14.265 --> 04:05:15.666]  General Stubblebine, I'll say it.
[04:05:15.666 --> 04:05:22.448]  Do we not, as free sentient beings, have a right to self-defense against aggression?
[04:05:22.448 --> 04:05:25.189]  I don't care what bullcrap law they say they've got.
[04:05:27.548 --> 04:05:28.229]  We're good.
[04:05:32.162 --> 04:05:35.023]  I'm going to be standing on my hind legs yelling.
[04:05:35.023 --> 04:05:37.665]  And they need to go to the website.
[04:05:37.665 --> 04:05:39.365]  They need to take the action.
[04:05:39.365 --> 04:05:46.509]  And they need to make sure that all of their friends, and their friends, friends, friends, and their friends, friends, friends, friends, friends do the same.
[04:05:46.509 --> 04:05:51.531]  Because the way we're going to beat this thing, Alex, is through mass.
[04:05:51.531 --> 04:05:58.354]  And it's called action by every single American who does not want to die.
[04:05:58.354 --> 04:05:58.915]  Period.
[04:06:02.173 --> 04:06:02.413]  Yes.
[04:06:17.774 --> 04:06:23.760]  If it's, as people fight it, is to secure eventual peace and prosperity.
[04:06:23.760 --> 04:06:27.044]  Now for the generals and the globalists, it's a whole different matter.
[04:06:27.044 --> 04:06:29.907]  But what people want is peace and prosperity.
[04:06:29.907 --> 04:06:34.652]  And if we accept these vaccines, we will have neither peace nor prosperity.
[04:06:34.652 --> 04:06:38.396]  If we push back, yeah, they'll be back again next time.
[04:06:40.458 --> 04:06:56.916]  I was about to say, look at 2002-2003, they tried to make their first responders take the inoculations as an act of supplication and submission, and their own enforcers who were gonna supposedly be running the forced injection drills on us, and they've had these drills publicly, they won't even take it.
[04:06:57.236 --> 04:07:02.318]  But let's not let them have this fake victory of scaring everybody with the flu.
[04:07:02.318 --> 04:07:03.938]  Then it kind of blows over.
[04:07:03.938 --> 04:07:06.919]  They give people a soft kill weapon, kills them a decade later.
[04:07:06.919 --> 04:07:10.541]  That's never psychologically attached to the event of the vaccine.
[04:07:10.541 --> 04:07:13.702]  And then next time they say take the shot, people are more compliant.
[04:07:13.982 --> 04:07:14.443]  Absolutely!
[04:07:14.443 --> 04:07:14.743]  Absolutely!
[04:07:30.566 --> 04:07:31.947]  Absolutely, 100%.
[04:07:31.947 --> 04:07:42.571]  And every voice needs to be, not just that voice, but every single person that they know to get their voice is going to, because mass wins.
[04:07:42.571 --> 04:07:45.072]  Let's call it freedom's multiplier.
[04:07:45.072 --> 04:07:57.317]  If you sign this demand, and it's not a request, Alex, it's a demand for the right to control what happens to your body and your children's body, and you don't get 10 people or 100 people to do
[04:08:03.521 --> 04:08:09.386]  Absolutely, and call into other talk shows and say, I want you to have General Stubblebine and Dr. Labo on.
[04:08:09.386 --> 04:08:11.707]  I want you to have other people on to talk about this.
[04:08:11.707 --> 04:08:13.869]  Get a huge buzz going as well.
[04:08:13.869 --> 04:08:15.790]  That's another area of the info war.
[04:08:15.790 --> 04:08:18.512]  These letters to the criminals is good as well.
[04:08:18.512 --> 04:08:24.097]  But this is part of the domestication, part of the process of training us to take their soft kill weapons.
[04:08:24.677 --> 04:08:29.645]  General Stubblebine, as this develops, let me have both of you back up in the near future as we go into the fall.
[04:08:29.645 --> 04:08:36.395]  You too, Dr. Labo, and Godspeed in the work you're doing on all these other fronts with Codex Alimentarius.
[04:08:36.395 --> 04:08:39.299]  Let's not wait five or six months before we have you back on again.
[04:08:40.340 --> 04:08:44.641]  Let me close in one other Sun Tzu quote.
[04:08:44.641 --> 04:08:49.263]  There comes a time in every battle when both sides are defeated.
[04:08:49.263 --> 04:08:54.744]  The side that persists at that time is the winner.
[04:08:54.744 --> 04:09:02.987]  It's time for our voices to continue to make noise so that we are heard in mass.
[04:09:02.987 --> 04:09:03.367]  Thank you.
[04:09:04.232 --> 04:09:05.412]  Absolutely.
[04:09:05.412 --> 04:09:07.393]  Dr. Labo, General Stubblebine, God bless you.
[04:09:07.393 --> 04:09:08.353]  We'll talk to you again soon.
[04:09:08.353 --> 04:09:09.573]  Keep up the good work.
[04:09:09.573 --> 04:09:11.113]  Thanks, Alex.
[04:09:11.113 --> 04:09:12.274]  You judge them by their fruits.
[04:09:12.274 --> 04:09:14.954]  I only see good fruits from these people.
[04:09:14.954 --> 04:09:17.495]  I've seen no evidence when people try to demonize them and attack them.
[04:09:17.495 --> 04:09:20.896]  But regardless, let's not get diverted by, is Alex Jones good or bad?
[04:09:20.896 --> 04:09:22.396]  Or is General Stubblebine good or bad?
[04:09:22.396 --> 04:09:23.716]  Is Ron Paul good or bad?
[04:09:23.716 --> 04:09:28.677]  You know the New World Order has signed executive orders and are saying they're getting ready to forcibly inject you.
[04:09:28.677 --> 04:09:30.818]  I can show you a newscast of every newscast that we have.
[04:09:30.818 --> 04:09:31.258]  You've heard it.
[04:09:31.258 --> 04:09:31.718]  You've seen it.
[04:09:32.438 --> 04:09:33.299]  That's the issue.
[04:09:33.299 --> 04:09:34.780]  Face the issue at hand.
[04:09:34.780 --> 04:09:36.141]  Force inoculations.
[04:09:36.141 --> 04:09:39.704]  You want to call me an agent because I'm saying you shouldn't have to take force inoculations?
[04:09:39.704 --> 04:09:40.204]  Go ahead.
[04:09:40.204 --> 04:09:41.545]  That's COINTELPRO.
[04:09:41.545 --> 04:09:42.486]  Be weak-minded if you want.
[04:09:42.486 --> 04:09:50.552]  I got a few points I want to make in the next five minutes and then we are going to end this transmission for today.
[04:09:50.552 --> 04:09:52.874]  But first off, I want people to look at this again.
[04:09:52.874 --> 04:09:55.676]  Look at this article again and look at it carefully.
[04:09:55.676 --> 04:09:58.418]  This is key.
[04:09:58.418 --> 04:10:01.801]  I want everybody to go to InfoWars.com.
[04:10:01.801 --> 04:10:02.001]  I know
[04:10:03.823 --> 04:10:06.024]  I know that Kurt Nimmo and Paul Watson are doing stories on this.
[04:10:06.024 --> 04:10:10.706]  They need to tie it into the GPS and the people getting phone calls about inoculations and the rest of it.
[04:10:10.706 --> 04:10:17.710]  Healthcare bill will fund state vaccine teams to conduct interventions in private homes.
[04:10:17.710 --> 04:10:19.051]  CNS News, very credible.
[04:10:19.051 --> 04:10:20.671]  There is a knock at the front door.
[04:10:20.671 --> 04:10:24.833]  Peeking through the window, a mother sees a man with a woman, both in uniform.
[04:10:24.833 --> 04:10:26.494]  Now, I was getting calls about this in the last month.
[04:10:26.494 --> 04:10:27.775]  This is now already happening.
[04:10:29.298 --> 04:10:32.100]  They are agents of health care reform.
[04:10:32.100 --> 04:10:33.941]  Excuse me, ma'am, says the man.
[04:10:33.941 --> 04:10:35.483]  People have been describing this.
[04:10:35.483 --> 04:10:38.025]  They're even wearing, like, fake police uniforms.
[04:10:38.025 --> 04:10:40.887]  They're, like, blue that look like a police uniform.
[04:10:40.887 --> 04:10:41.507]  God help us.
[04:10:41.507 --> 04:10:43.969]  The eugenics teams are on the street.
[04:10:43.969 --> 04:10:45.490]  Excuse me, ma'am, says the man.
[04:10:45.490 --> 04:10:50.113]  Our records show you, our 11-year-old daughter, has not been immunized with general warts, which is the
[04:10:51.181 --> 04:10:53.385]  Soft kill Gardasil.
[04:10:53.385 --> 04:10:56.670]  And your four-year-old still needs a chickenpox vaccine, says the woman.
[04:10:56.670 --> 04:10:59.454]  He will not be able to start kindergarten unless he gets the shot.
[04:10:59.454 --> 04:11:03.821]  You know, says the man, smiling from ear to ear.
[04:11:03.821 --> 04:11:06.005]  And it just goes over, folks, this is now going on.
[04:11:08.291 --> 04:11:11.614]  My God, and they're talking about how it's a bill and the bill summary says they're going to do that.
[04:11:11.614 --> 04:11:14.817]  This is already being done with the CDC federally.
[04:11:14.817 --> 04:11:16.898]  I mean, this is total hell.
[04:11:16.898 --> 04:11:18.820]  Imagine if the Nazis would have come around.
[04:11:18.820 --> 04:11:19.661]  Oh, there's a flu scare.
[04:11:19.661 --> 04:11:21.222]  Everybody take your shot.
[04:11:21.222 --> 04:11:22.723]  Oh, people would have willingly done it.
[04:11:22.723 --> 04:11:24.565]  See, this is more sophisticated.
[04:11:24.565 --> 04:11:27.267]  The eugenicists got beaten back 60 years ago.
[04:11:27.267 --> 04:11:33.092]  Now they're here with a vengeance operating covertly.
[04:11:33.092 --> 04:11:36.054]  Okay, I want to go over these notes I've got here.
[04:11:37.233 --> 04:11:44.543]  But I also want to ask listeners to go to PrisonPlanet.com and get this article and get it out to everybody.
[04:11:44.543 --> 04:11:48.509]  This is of the greatest import that this be done.
[04:11:51.932 --> 04:11:57.133]  Obama's science advisor called for a planetary regime to enforce its military and population control measures.
[04:11:57.133 --> 04:11:58.534]  Folks, this has the documents, the book.
[04:11:58.534 --> 04:11:59.334]  You've got to read this.
[04:11:59.334 --> 04:12:01.314]  Now, these are some notes I wrote this morning.
[04:12:01.314 --> 04:12:03.215]  I promised I was going to cover these on air.
[04:12:03.215 --> 04:12:14.078]  I'm going to spend hours elaborating on each, but I'm just going to go over these points I wrote slowly so you know my philosophy and where I stand and where I hope people will stand with me on.
[04:12:14.078 --> 04:12:14.558]  We live
[04:12:16.383 --> 04:12:23.287]  A wonderful life on a wonderful planet full of wonders and full of just so many great things and so much goodness.
[04:12:23.287 --> 04:12:27.749]  And we've got to admit the evil in the world and fight the evil in the world to protect the good.
[04:12:27.749 --> 04:12:29.910]  And stop saying, hey man, just be positive.
[04:12:29.910 --> 04:12:30.691]  We are positive.
[04:12:30.691 --> 04:12:33.693]  That's why we're fighting.
[04:12:33.693 --> 04:12:35.874]  The only way to be in control is to kill.
[04:12:37.057 --> 04:12:40.038]  It is not easy to do good, it is easy to do evil.
[04:12:40.038 --> 04:12:44.160]  See, it's hard to control an outcome if you're trying to build and nurture and give people freedom.
[04:12:44.160 --> 04:12:49.243]  But it's easy if you're the dark new world order chiefs to engage in evil and extermination and control.
[04:12:49.243 --> 04:12:52.184]  Because they don't care who they hurt.
[04:12:52.184 --> 04:12:54.405]  Just remember that.
[04:12:54.405 --> 04:13:01.108]  They are the priests of power who love to press on the nerve of power, who love to grind humanity into submission, who love to engage in horrible tyrannies.
[04:13:01.108 --> 04:13:02.129]  We must resist them.
[04:13:03.703 --> 04:13:05.484]  So, step up to the plate.
[04:13:05.484 --> 04:13:12.008]  As I said in that rant in the first hour, which we're about to cut back to in a moment.
[04:13:12.008 --> 04:13:13.089]  Look what we've turned into.
[04:13:13.089 --> 04:13:13.549]  Torture.
[04:13:13.549 --> 04:13:15.490]  Tortures of people's children in front of their parents.
[04:13:15.490 --> 04:13:16.851]  Now admitted mainstream news.
[04:13:16.851 --> 04:13:19.112]  I told you seven years ago, now it's mainstream news.
[04:13:19.112 --> 04:13:20.433]  Hit teams.
[04:13:20.433 --> 04:13:22.374]  Banks robbing us and stealing.
[04:13:22.374 --> 04:13:25.516]  We're going into bondage to the elite, who think of us as total scum.
[04:13:29.690 --> 04:13:41.114]  To my attackers, many of which are not COINTELPRO and are not government, but pick up on COINTELPRO, who believe it's fashionable to attack me because I'm the most prominent voice in the fight against the globalists.
[04:13:41.114 --> 04:13:43.194]  My God, I can't believe I'm the most prominent.
[04:13:43.194 --> 04:13:49.336]  Anybody in the world, maybe Ron Paul or me, but I'm the more hardcore on some of the issues he won't get into.
[04:13:49.336 --> 04:13:53.537]  As he said to the camera as well, I haven't gotten to 9-11 because I'm too busy.
[04:13:53.537 --> 04:13:55.218]  We understand, but the issue is,
[04:13:57.213 --> 04:14:00.334]  To those that attack me just because of jealousy or whatever.
[04:14:00.334 --> 04:14:00.914]  Jealous of what?
[04:14:00.914 --> 04:14:03.315]  That I was up here at one o'clock in the morning last night?
[04:14:03.315 --> 04:14:04.856]  Jealous because I'm fighting hard?
[04:14:04.856 --> 04:14:06.077]  Be leaders.
[04:14:06.077 --> 04:14:07.297]  Don't destroy yourselves.
[04:14:07.297 --> 04:14:16.121]  I want you to be right beside us and right in front of us and right behind us in this fight and I know I'm good and I know I'm for real and it's just sad to see you not being your own person.
[04:14:16.121 --> 04:14:16.681]  To see you
[04:14:17.541 --> 04:14:19.182]  Obsessed with me.
[04:14:19.182 --> 04:14:23.845]  And in a way, it helps me become more famous and better known, but that's not what I want.
[04:14:23.845 --> 04:14:26.446]  I want us all to be leaders and to affect change.
[04:14:26.446 --> 04:14:33.010]  But in a negative, sick, worldly system, you're actually helping Alex Jones when you lie about me and attack me and spread my name.
[04:14:33.010 --> 04:14:37.113]  So in a way, I guess God just blesses us and people find out who I really am and find out the truth.
[04:14:37.113 --> 04:14:43.597]  So, it's just hurtful because I know I'm for real and I know 99% of what's said about me is a lie or a distortion.
[04:14:44.677 --> 04:14:52.902]  And a lot of you aren't government operatives, you just are very worldly and been twisted and I feel sorry for you.
[04:14:52.902 --> 04:14:59.466]  And I want you to be your own person and not be played.
[04:14:59.466 --> 04:15:01.207]  Be your own man and woman.
[04:15:01.207 --> 04:15:11.374]  A message to the feds, the contractors, the ideologues, those of you that are on the wrong side of history against those of us that love liberty and freedom.
[04:15:11.374 --> 04:15:13.155]  This system hates you and abuses you.
[04:15:14.611 --> 04:15:16.192]  And it's destroying your future as well.
[04:15:16.192 --> 04:15:19.714]  And I know they're hitting you with soft kill weapons and sterilization weapons.
[04:15:19.714 --> 04:15:20.935]  And it's just a fact.
[04:15:20.935 --> 04:15:28.680]  And you may like to feel like you're the winner and con yourself and decide to serve the system and laugh at us and decide you're in control.
[04:15:28.680 --> 04:15:31.242]  Bless your soul, you're not in control.
[04:15:31.242 --> 04:15:35.325]  The only way you're in control is of your own soul deciding to do right.
[04:15:35.325 --> 04:15:38.167]  You can make that decision, but the rest of it's in God's hands.
[04:15:39.457 --> 04:15:49.485]  And so I ask you to make that decision to do right, and to really, if you've got any soul left, any humanity left, to realize what you've been part of and stand up against the New World Order.
[04:15:49.485 --> 04:15:56.731]  So don't be part of the wrong side of history.
[04:15:56.731 --> 04:16:05.058]  You know, many of us are born into these different tribal groups and religious groups and are controlled, and we were sold out before we were even born.
[04:16:05.058 --> 04:16:07.140]  There's still time to turn back and wake up.
[04:16:08.510 --> 04:16:20.493]  And commit to standing up against tyranny and just getting out of your programming, realizing there's a bigger system around you that people are trying to manipulate you, that there are covert and overt agendas.
[04:16:20.493 --> 04:16:24.815]  I also just want to say I love life and creation and everything good and wholesome.
[04:16:24.815 --> 04:16:32.297]  I want to say that, and that I've been very appreciative and thankful for life, and that I know that good can win the day when it decides to stand up and take action.
[04:16:33.524 --> 04:16:43.602]  And I believe that that love of innocence and that love of creativity and that sense of wonderment is the keys to the universe and the soul and heart of God.
[04:16:43.602 --> 04:16:45.045]  Don't ever let them break your spirit!
[04:16:46.903 --> 04:16:50.806]  Doesn't matter how much I get attacked, how much I get lied about, how much people twist and distort.
[04:16:50.806 --> 04:16:51.847]  I know I'm real.
[04:16:51.847 --> 04:16:52.767]  I know I'm good.
[04:16:52.767 --> 04:16:54.289]  I know I'm telling the truth.
[04:16:54.289 --> 04:16:55.229]  And that's what matters.
[04:16:55.229 --> 04:16:58.412]  And you should have that same attitude and just move forward against the globalists.
[04:16:58.412 --> 04:17:00.053]  Warn the people you can.
[04:17:00.053 --> 04:17:01.414]  When you get laughed at, move on.
[04:17:01.414 --> 04:17:02.395]  It doesn't matter.
[04:17:02.395 --> 04:17:03.736]  It's sad.
[04:17:03.736 --> 04:17:10.221]  Stop caring what people think about you.
[04:17:10.221 --> 04:17:13.583]  Evil hides behind good, but the proof is always in the fruit.
[04:17:13.583 --> 04:17:14.704]  So, look at that.
[04:17:14.704 --> 04:17:16.586]  Realize how the enemy camouflages themselves.
[04:17:18.706 --> 04:17:24.331]  The elite are compartmentalized, specialized, and compartmentalized into different sectors of evil.
[04:17:24.331 --> 04:17:25.892]  Many of them don't see the big picture.
[04:17:25.892 --> 04:17:40.325]  So as you show people the big picture and discuss the greater truths, you're gonna unlock many of the evil people out there who've been caught up in this and not realized what they were part of, and many of them can come out of it.
[04:17:40.325 --> 04:17:45.169]  And many people will laugh at you up front, but as what you've warned them about comes true down the road,
[04:17:46.860 --> 04:17:47.781]  They will wake up.
[04:17:47.781 --> 04:17:49.141]  So it's a delayed event.
[04:17:49.141 --> 04:17:51.983]  Don't expect to see instant success when you're reaching out to people.
[04:17:51.983 --> 04:17:53.404]  Just like fighting the Federal Reserve.
[04:17:53.404 --> 04:17:57.246]  Look how far we've now come.
[04:17:57.246 --> 04:18:01.668]  We are in the midst of the greatest transformation in human history for good and bad.
[04:18:01.668 --> 04:18:09.032]  With the technological developments, the acceleration of knowledge, the acceleration of weapon systems, the decadence, the goodness, the good, the bad, and the ugly.
[04:18:09.032 --> 04:18:11.474]  Just realize you're part of an incredible time in history.
[04:18:11.474 --> 04:18:14.455]  Stop watching the sports, the sitcoms, the stuff that doesn't matter.
[04:18:14.455 --> 04:18:15.556]  Get tuned into reality.
[04:18:19.747 --> 04:18:20.828]  And leave your mark.
[04:18:20.828 --> 04:18:22.089]  Communicate with the future.
[04:18:22.089 --> 04:18:24.470]  Do things good for society and humanity.
[04:18:24.470 --> 04:18:26.592]  Find out the truth.
[04:18:26.592 --> 04:18:30.434]  And love humanity and realize you're part of something bigger.
[04:18:30.434 --> 04:18:35.117]  Realize that we are our ancestors and we are our future progeny.
[04:18:35.117 --> 04:18:36.498]  And that we're all one species.
[04:18:36.498 --> 04:18:39.660]  We're individuals, but we're also part of a greater tapestry.
[04:18:39.660 --> 04:18:46.225]  And in that, you certainly never die unless the species is irrevocably damaged by the criminal predators that are running the system.
[04:18:47.759 --> 04:18:52.844]  And again, leave the species better off than when you came to it.
[04:18:52.844 --> 04:18:55.346]  You know, that really is the whole sum of it.
[04:18:55.346 --> 04:18:56.788]  I want to say great job to the crew.
[04:18:56.788 --> 04:19:02.453]  We're going to go to retransmission now with a key rant I was doing in the first hour that I thought was very informative.
[04:19:02.453 --> 04:19:03.494]  A lot of key info.
[04:19:03.494 --> 04:19:04.154]  So that's coming up.
[04:19:04.154 --> 04:19:05.856]  Great job, crew.
[04:19:05.856 --> 04:19:07.478]  And as always, thank you for all your prayers.
[04:19:07.478 --> 04:19:12.642]  I'm praying for all of you freedom lovers and people that love decency and creativity and honor and innocence.
[04:19:13.604 --> 04:19:14.505]  I'm here with you.
[04:19:14.505 --> 04:19:15.085]  You're with me.
[04:19:15.085 --> 04:19:18.968]  We're together in history together, in this moment, in forever.
[04:19:18.968 --> 04:19:21.511]  And I'll see you back live Monday.
[04:19:21.511 --> 04:19:23.072]  Burmese is sitting in tomorrow.
[04:19:23.072 --> 04:19:26.435]  And on Sunday, I'm Alex Jones signing off.
[04:19:26.435 --> 04:19:27.415]  God bless you all.
[04:19:42.734 --> 04:19:42.794]  You
