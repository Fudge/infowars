[00:00.000 --> 00:12.000]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.000 --> 00:31.000]  he's alex jones on the gcn radio network and now live from austin texas alex jones
[00:31.000 --> 00:35.000]  welcome ladies and gentlemen welcome and thank you so much for joining us
[00:35.000 --> 00:45.000]  it is thursday the 16th day of july 2009 we're gonna be here live for the next
[00:45.000 --> 00:53.000]  four hours we have wane paul wane paul brother of congressman ron paul
[00:53.000 --> 01:01.000]  uncle of rand paul joining us coming up by two hours from now and then we have
[01:01.000 --> 01:09.000]  rima lebo medical doctor and albert in stubble bind the third major general
[01:09.000 --> 01:14.000]  and boy we have a lot to talk about their codex alimentarius you name it oh
[01:14.000 --> 01:19.000]  and before I forget guys I had it in here last week print me that latest wired
[01:19.000 --> 01:23.000]  magazine article with a pentagon admits they're going system-wide with psychic
[01:23.000 --> 01:27.000]  soldiers and all that stuff because it was a general stubble bind that was first
[01:27.000 --> 01:33.000]  over all those programs the real x files so now that a lot of us declassified you
[01:33.000 --> 01:36.000]  can probably talk a bit more about it though that's not the main reason I have
[01:36.000 --> 01:42.000]  him coming on the show today former head of army intelligence former head of
[01:42.000 --> 01:50.000]  special forces and another capacity that is coming up today so you don't want to
[01:50.000 --> 01:54.000]  miss both of those interviews yeah I don't think I've ever heard Wayne paul on
[01:54.000 --> 02:01.000]  radio I ran into him at a in the fed demonstration up in D town up in Dallas
[02:01.000 --> 02:06.000]  Texas last year we later learned the army was there watching us in the army
[02:06.000 --> 02:10.000]  memo said watch out don't let them know your army they may rip your throat out
[02:10.000 --> 02:15.000]  like 20 days 28 days later or something it describes us as just deadly cunning
[02:15.000 --> 02:23.000]  deadly evil just any minute if we were to know that they were military spying on
[02:23.000 --> 02:27.000]  us that we might turn into terrorists and go after them you can read the army
[02:27.000 --> 02:31.000]  memo we were sent this by the army by inside sources I guess by our
[02:31.000 --> 02:36.000]  infiltrators infiltrators for the republic infiltrators for liberty in
[02:36.000 --> 02:40.000]  the middle rights and constitution infiltrators that know it's illegal to
[02:40.000 --> 02:44.000]  have the military spying on peaceful Americans that don't want an offshore
[02:44.000 --> 02:51.000]  private criminal bank gang raping us and then after we broke that secret army
[02:51.000 --> 02:57.000]  document months later the Baltimore Sun and other publications reported that
[02:57.000 --> 03:05.000]  in Maryland regular army was spying on the last tea parties oh that's right
[03:05.000 --> 03:09.000]  you dare come out and say you don't want higher taxes you don't want open
[03:09.000 --> 03:14.000]  borders you don't want to live under a foreign IMF World Bank control to the
[03:14.000 --> 03:20.000]  World Trade Organization you got the army on your six the good news is this is
[03:20.000 --> 03:31.000]  waking the army up because seventy four percent of the money given to political
[03:31.000 --> 03:37.000]  candidates early in the primaries until Ron Paul dropped off and dropped out of
[03:37.000 --> 03:45.000]  the military was given to Ron Paul what does that say to the new world order
[03:45.000 --> 03:53.000]  that's why in 2008 what was Bilderberg discussing from our inside sources
[03:53.000 --> 04:00.000]  according to Esteline and Tucker they were talking about Ron Paul and they
[04:00.000 --> 04:03.000]  weren't worried about him winning they knew they could block him out and rig
[04:03.000 --> 04:08.000]  that and demonize him and ignore him they were worried about the citizen
[04:08.000 --> 04:12.000]  movement around it they were worried about the universities they were
[04:12.000 --> 04:15.000]  worried about how it was no longer the fake right wing paradigm or the fake
[04:15.000 --> 04:19.000]  left-wing socialist paradigm that the youth were into but ending the Fed
[04:19.000 --> 04:22.000]  getting back to the Republic getting back to the Constitution getting back to
[04:22.000 --> 04:28.000]  the Bill of Rights getting back to what made America great what made
[04:28.000 --> 04:36.000]  Americana be able to exist what came before baseball and apple pie why we
[04:36.000 --> 04:41.000]  love the flag what it really symbolizes the blood the sweat the tears the gut
[04:41.000 --> 04:48.000]  the guts that were spilt out on battlefields the spirit of 1776 rising
[04:48.000 --> 04:56.000]  growing forming first as a vapor then the bones and the muscles now the flesh

[08:03.000 --> 08:06.000]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network
[08:06.000 --> 08:16.000]  Music
[08:16.000 --> 08:19.000]  We are living in the future
[08:19.000 --> 08:21.000]  it is 2009
[08:21.000 --> 08:24.000]  soon be 2010
[08:24.000 --> 08:26.000]  Music
[08:26.000 --> 08:28.000]  There are giant
[08:28.000 --> 08:31.000]  highly secretive
[08:31.000 --> 08:34.000]  government and private industrial
[08:34.000 --> 08:37.000]  reservations all over the world
[08:37.000 --> 08:41.000]  with technological systems and developments at least
[08:41.000 --> 08:46.000]  30 to 35 years more advanced
[08:46.000 --> 08:49.000]  than what the public is aware of
[08:49.000 --> 08:52.000]  now do you understand what that means
[08:55.000 --> 08:58.000]  do you know what that means
[08:58.000 --> 09:01.000]  if technology is doubling every two years
[09:01.000 --> 09:05.000]  at the technological plane of existence we're on here
[09:05.000 --> 09:08.000]  that the general public lives in
[09:08.000 --> 09:11.000]  at this arrested development stage that they have us
[09:11.000 --> 09:14.000]  almost frozen at
[09:14.000 --> 09:18.000]  if technology is doubling
[09:18.000 --> 09:22.000]  we'll do the exponential math with a calculator
[09:22.000 --> 09:25.000]  guys do that what's an exponential curve
[09:25.000 --> 09:30.000]  let's just say 30 years doubling each time exponentially
[09:30.000 --> 09:34.000]  how do you do that equation I just thought to do it I can't
[09:34.000 --> 09:38.000]  chew gum and kick butt at the same time
[09:38.000 --> 09:41.000]  or chew gum and I guess talk at the same time
[09:41.000 --> 09:45.000]  Jaren do the math on that how would you do that equation
[09:45.000 --> 09:49.000]  300th power
[09:49.000 --> 09:52.000]  yeah what is what is an exponential
[09:52.000 --> 09:55.000]  take the number 10
[09:55.000 --> 09:59.000]  because you've got to have some number to use
[09:59.000 --> 10:03.000]  or take the number one
[10:03.000 --> 10:06.000]  saying that's the level we're at right now and then
[10:06.000 --> 10:09.000]  exponentially increase it to the power of 30
[10:09.000 --> 10:13.000]  that's easy now the issue here is
[10:13.000 --> 10:16.000]  things are a lot more advanced
[10:16.000 --> 10:19.000]  than even what we're seeing and when I watch the politicians
[10:19.000 --> 10:22.000]  when I watch the elites at Davos
[10:22.000 --> 10:26.000]  the last decade or so it's almost like they don't even care we're here
[10:26.000 --> 10:29.000]  it's as if they're so distracted by the things they know
[10:29.000 --> 10:33.000]  the things they're aware of the satisfied looks on their faces
[10:33.000 --> 10:38.000]  don't match the body language and behavior and sociology
[10:38.000 --> 10:42.000]  of past elites even a JFK
[10:42.000 --> 10:46.000]  or a John D. Rockefeller
[10:46.000 --> 10:49.000]  or a queen mother
[10:49.000 --> 10:52.000]  or an adult Hitler
[10:52.000 --> 10:56.000]  or a emperor Harahito
[10:56.000 --> 10:59.000]  they were still tied into society they still cared
[10:59.000 --> 11:03.000]  about movie stars and they still cared about literary achievements and they
[11:03.000 --> 11:06.000]  they still even wanted to be part of the world
[11:06.000 --> 11:10.000]  the elite more and more are completely removed
[11:10.000 --> 11:14.000]  from the hype the society the control systems
[11:14.000 --> 11:17.000]  they themselves have in many cases created
[11:17.000 --> 11:20.000]  or expanded they're really good at taking existing platforms
[11:20.000 --> 11:24.000]  and just expanding them and using them for their own programs
[11:24.000 --> 11:30.000]  this is a scientific dictatorship
[11:30.000 --> 11:35.000]  there is no doubt they have very powerful life extension technologies
[11:35.000 --> 11:39.000]  I wouldn't say that they have the power of immortality
[11:39.000 --> 11:42.000]  because people die in car wrecks, people die in helicopter crashes
[11:42.000 --> 11:45.000]  people slip and fall and hit their head
[11:45.000 --> 11:49.000]  even if they have cures for cancer and things
[11:49.000 --> 11:52.000]  the issue just wears out and falls apart
[11:52.000 --> 11:56.000]  but they do test all their new technological developments on us
[11:56.000 --> 11:59.000]  that's what the medical profession is called a practice
[11:59.000 --> 12:02.000]  a medical practice, a surgical practice, a dental practice
[12:02.000 --> 12:06.000]  an eye surgery practice
[12:06.000 --> 12:09.000]  they are practicing they are always getting better
[12:09.000 --> 12:12.000]  they are always trying to raise the state of the art
[12:12.000 --> 12:15.000]  it is an art integrated into a science
[12:15.000 --> 12:18.000]  but science itself is an art
[12:18.000 --> 12:22.000]  so there is no doubt they have incredible life extension technologies already
[12:22.000 --> 12:26.000]  and the elites say themselves that they can just extend them another 10, 20, 30 years
[12:26.000 --> 12:30.000]  that elites that are 40, 50 years old today
[12:30.000 --> 12:35.000]  are going to be able to live for all intents and purposes forever
[12:35.000 --> 12:41.000]  because they say if they can extend their life out of their 50 to 100 years
[12:41.000 --> 12:44.000]  then there is no doubt they are going to be able to merge
[12:44.000 --> 12:48.000]  with the cybernetic interfaces with the biotech
[12:48.000 --> 12:53.000]  with the robotics
[12:53.000 --> 12:56.000]  20 years ago
[12:56.000 --> 13:00.000]  they were engaging in brain surgeries that were giving the blind
[13:00.000 --> 13:06.000]  limited black and white sight
[13:06.000 --> 13:12.000]  they are just now allowing that to be available to
[13:12.000 --> 13:14.000]  some of the blind
[13:14.000 --> 13:18.000]  but under bioethics, under eugenics, under the carbon footprint
[13:18.000 --> 13:23.000]  they are openly saying the general public is not going to have access to this
[13:23.000 --> 13:26.000]  there is going to be a rationing of this
[13:26.000 --> 13:29.000]  they are saying the healthcare cost is too great
[13:29.000 --> 13:33.000]  because it is vertically integrated in its monopoly
[13:33.000 --> 13:37.000]  and they want a global government so many of these new advanced treatments
[13:37.000 --> 13:41.000]  can't take hold in other nations that are under their control
[13:41.000 --> 13:43.000]  they can't have Iran standing alone
[13:43.000 --> 13:45.000]  they can't have Libya standing alone
[13:45.000 --> 13:50.000]  they can't have any nation standing alone
[13:50.000 --> 13:53.000]  because high tech systems will develop there
[13:53.000 --> 13:59.000]  that's why any high tech developments have to be sabotaged by spies
[13:59.000 --> 14:03.000]  by saboteurs
[14:03.000 --> 14:05.000]  and that's what the NSA does
[14:05.000 --> 14:10.000]  they identify who is developing a technological system that the global has already discovered decades before
[14:10.000 --> 14:12.000]  they may be trying to develop it
[14:12.000 --> 14:15.000]  and many of the assassinations, the hits, the murders
[14:15.000 --> 14:17.000]  it's done against microbiologists
[14:17.000 --> 14:19.000]  it's done against tinkers
[14:19.000 --> 14:21.000]  it's done against inventors
[14:21.000 --> 14:23.000]  it's done against small companies
[14:23.000 --> 14:25.000]  if they don't sell
[14:25.000 --> 14:26.000]  they die
[14:26.000 --> 14:29.000]  or they get audited or they get shut down
[14:29.000 --> 14:34.000]  the globalists are in charge because they mean business
[14:34.000 --> 14:36.000]  they are professional
[14:36.000 --> 14:38.000]  they are focused
[14:38.000 --> 14:40.000]  they know what the prize is, the world
[14:40.000 --> 14:43.000]  and human evolution and development of the stars
[14:43.000 --> 14:47.000]  and they don't intend for most of us in our progeny to be part of that
[14:47.000 --> 14:51.000]  and I don't like being walled off in the global reservation
[14:51.000 --> 14:55.000]  outside the true technological reservations that are above the level we're at
[14:55.000 --> 15:00.000]  I don't like my children not being able to have access to the full human potential and destiny
[15:00.000 --> 15:03.000]  I don't like my food and water being drugged
[15:03.000 --> 15:05.000]  and being poisoned with chemicals
[15:05.000 --> 15:12.000]  I don't like open terraforming, geo-engineering going on openly around me
[15:12.000 --> 15:16.000]  and the public so mind numbed, so mind smashed
[15:16.000 --> 15:21.000]  so distracted and diverted by distractions and petty issues
[15:21.000 --> 15:27.000]  that I'm sitting here bringing you the absolute heart of the matter
[15:27.000 --> 15:34.000]  and many of you can't even grasp what I'm saying when it's so elementary
[15:34.000 --> 15:39.000]  it is elementary
[15:39.000 --> 15:42.000]  elementary
[15:42.000 --> 15:47.000]  I was on the treadmill this morning watching some HBO sports documentary
[15:47.000 --> 15:53.000]  where they were looking at the famous Ethiopian runner
[15:53.000 --> 15:57.000]  I forgot the name I hit record so I can watch the rest of it when I get back to town
[15:57.000 --> 16:04.000]  going to LA for a few days this weekend on business, very important business
[16:04.000 --> 16:10.000]  and I was running on the treadmill for an hour this morning
[16:10.000 --> 16:15.000]  and watched a lot of the show, it was about the famous Russian wrestler
[16:15.000 --> 16:20.000]  and it was about the different individuals
[16:20.000 --> 16:26.000]  and while I was talking about the Russian wrestler, the big three-time gold medal winner
[16:26.000 --> 16:31.000]  Alexander something, the point is
[16:31.000 --> 16:37.000]  that they read a quote from Homer
[16:37.000 --> 16:42.000]  so I ran in after I got off the treadmill and printed it
[16:42.000 --> 16:45.000]  and then of course forgotten and left the house and didn't bring it
[16:45.000 --> 16:47.000]  but maybe I'll pull it up during a break
[16:47.000 --> 16:53.000]  the issue is that I already knew this and I already read quotes by Cicero
[16:53.000 --> 16:58.000]  and I already read quotes by Josephus and I already read quotes by
[16:58.000 --> 17:04.000]  Roman and Greek and Jewish historians
[17:04.000 --> 17:09.000]  in their contemporary time, thousands of years ago
[17:09.000 --> 17:14.000]  and quotes by Julius Caesar
[17:14.000 --> 17:20.000]  and quotes by Cicero and about how sports and gladiatorial events are used to control you
[17:20.000 --> 17:25.000]  but I'd never seen the quote by Homer
[17:25.000 --> 17:31.000]  but the narrator gave the quote describing the wrestler
[17:31.000 --> 17:40.000]  and going back to 700 BC when wrestling Greco-Roman began in Greece
[17:40.000 --> 17:49.000]  and Homer was saying this is really great
[17:49.000 --> 17:52.000]  that sports are becoming very popular
[17:52.000 --> 17:59.000]  because now it is supplanting war-making as the only heroes we've got
[17:59.000 --> 18:02.000]  and as the leaders of society
[18:02.000 --> 18:11.000]  and now the new heroes are the wrestlers and the runners and the javelin throwers
[18:11.000 --> 18:15.000]  above everything else
[18:15.000 --> 18:19.000]  and so the only avenue to show your manhood will not be war and conflict
[18:19.000 --> 18:24.000]  and physical battle and political battle
[18:24.000 --> 18:27.000]  I mean that's Homer
[18:27.000 --> 18:32.000]  2,000 plus years ago describing that our heroes
[18:32.000 --> 18:36.000]  are football players and basketball players and baseball players
[18:36.000 --> 18:40.000]  but the issue is he was saying it was good
[18:40.000 --> 18:47.000]  because it could be used to end the Greek city-states constantly warring with each other
[18:47.000 --> 18:53.000]  just because that was their profession, that was what they did
[18:53.000 --> 18:59.000]  that was the age of true chivalry
[18:59.000 --> 19:01.000]  or the proto-type of it
[19:01.000 --> 19:06.000]  it's the same thing you saw with the end of the Napoleonic ideal of war
[19:06.000 --> 19:13.000]  being so romantic at the Alamo in 1836 where they almost wanted to die
[19:13.000 --> 19:21.000]  there was a great honor to fight 4,000 troops against 186
[19:21.000 --> 19:26.000]  victory or death, they wanted to die
[19:26.000 --> 19:28.000]  and it wasn't that they wanted to be tough guys
[19:28.000 --> 19:31.000]  they were in to not being afraid to die
[19:31.000 --> 19:35.000]  they were in to the rush of being surrounded and being attacked
[19:35.000 --> 19:41.000]  see sociologists and globalist planners can advertise it's good
[19:41.000 --> 19:45.000]  that men now have had their war-making instinct taken
[19:45.000 --> 19:50.000]  but the way they've been planted and used this it's actually been a great disease
[19:50.000 --> 19:58.000]  and I want to detail that and a lot more when we get back and talk about the true nature of the planetary system we now live under
[19:58.000 --> 20:05.000]  stay with us
[20:59.000 --> 21:02.000]  Good day Jim Newcomer from Midas Resources
[21:02.000 --> 21:06.000]  July 16th 2009, gold opened this morning at $940
[21:06.000 --> 21:10.000]  a one ounce gold coin to be purchased for at $966.96
[21:10.000 --> 21:14.000]  $4348 for a half ounce or $241.74 for the quarter ounce
[21:14.000 --> 21:18.000]  that's $966.96, $483.48 or $241.74
[21:18.000 --> 21:22.000]  Payload echoes market distortions increase money supply while productivity is going down
[21:22.000 --> 21:28.000]  wealth readers receiving injections of liquidity while smaller companies are forced to concede
[21:28.000 --> 21:32.000]  companies too big to fail are now using the tax dollars to increase market share paying fat dividends
[21:32.000 --> 21:35.000]  are you wondering why supplies of gold and silver coins are decreasing rapidly
[21:35.000 --> 21:38.000]  leaving the public scrambling to accumulate what's left
[21:38.000 --> 21:41.000]  fiat currencies values based on trust, fiscal responsibility
[21:41.000 --> 21:44.000]  is Congress and the White House acting responsibly earning your trust

[22:11.000 --> 22:14.000]  just as strong, just as well funded
[22:14.000 --> 22:20.000]  the Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people
[22:20.000 --> 22:25.000]  well Obama's already fudging, he's fudged since day one in this election
[22:25.000 --> 22:29.000]  if you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists
[22:29.000 --> 22:35.000]  who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs
[22:35.000 --> 22:36.000]  that's fascism
[22:36.000 --> 22:38.000]  it's not about left or right
[22:38.000 --> 22:40.000]  it's about a one-world government
[22:40.000 --> 22:43.000]  this film documents who Obama works for

[25:15.000 --> 25:18.000]  grave digger
[25:18.000 --> 25:21.000]  when you dig my grave
[25:21.000 --> 25:24.000]  could you make a shallow
[25:24.000 --> 25:30.000]  so I can feel the rain
[25:30.000 --> 25:32.000]  grave digger
[25:32.000 --> 25:37.000]  all right we are back live thank you for joining us today
[25:37.000 --> 25:41.000]  coming up in about an hour and forty minutes
[25:41.000 --> 25:44.000]  Wayne Paul brother of Dr. Ron Paul
[25:44.000 --> 25:46.000]  will be joining us then Dr.
[25:46.000 --> 25:52.000]  Rema E. Labo medical doctor and Albert and someone by the third major general
[25:52.000 --> 25:59.000]  talk about the soft kill operation that's going on the New World Order
[25:59.000 --> 26:03.000]  okay I got massive stacks of news here but I've got some notes I want to go over
[26:03.000 --> 26:07.000]  just basic philosophy how the system works
[26:07.000 --> 26:12.000]  my whole point in quoting Homer
[26:12.000 --> 26:16.000]  one of the Greek philosophers an ancient Greek philosopher
[26:16.000 --> 26:20.000]  is that they understood what made people tick back then
[26:20.000 --> 26:25.000]  and somehow the establishment media the social engineers
[26:25.000 --> 26:30.000]  convinced our culture to not even self analyze ourselves or not understand
[26:30.000 --> 26:35.000]  what makes humans tick or not understand our basic instincts
[26:35.000 --> 26:41.000]  and to not even look at how the advertisement and the media and the corporate system
[26:41.000 --> 26:47.000]  is programming us in fact they call it a conspiracy theorist
[26:47.000 --> 26:51.000]  a conspiracy theory if you even say somebody's trying to program you
[26:51.000 --> 26:55.000]  if you even say there's a ruling elite if you even say there's a corrupt elite
[26:55.000 --> 26:59.000]  if you even say there's any subterfuge in the courts of government
[26:59.000 --> 27:01.000]  in the courts of kings
[27:01.000 --> 27:07.000]  and it's anyone who knows history knows what an outlandish ridiculous
[27:07.000 --> 27:14.000]  fraud it is and how paper thin and flimsy and silly it is
[27:14.000 --> 27:17.000]  and I'm getting to realize we're under mass mind control
[27:17.000 --> 27:21.000]  much of the public believes there's no world government no move towards world government
[27:21.000 --> 27:26.000]  no North American Union, no Asian Union, no African Union, no American Union
[27:26.000 --> 27:28.000]  they don't know anything
[27:28.000 --> 27:30.000]  they don't know there's a new bank of the world being set up
[27:30.000 --> 27:34.000]  they don't know there's a new global tax being set up for carbon taxes
[27:34.000 --> 27:38.000]  they don't know there's a new global currency that's going to be cashless being set up
[27:38.000 --> 27:40.000]  all being announced
[27:40.000 --> 27:44.000]  because they were told for decades it didn't exist and crazy people talked about it
[27:44.000 --> 27:47.000]  now even as it's announced
[27:47.000 --> 27:50.000]  they will announce it on the news in a newscast
[27:50.000 --> 27:53.000]  in a prepared piece and then cut to the news anchor
[27:53.000 --> 27:56.000]  who makes fun of it and laughs at their own report
[27:56.000 --> 27:59.000]  and the message is we're telling you this is going on
[27:59.000 --> 28:01.000]  but it's not kosher
[28:01.000 --> 28:06.000]  it's not acceptable for you to accept it's real
[28:06.000 --> 28:08.000]  so we're telling you we're going to do this
[28:08.000 --> 28:11.000]  but you are to engage in double think
[28:11.000 --> 28:14.000]  and accept it and lay down and not resist it
[28:14.000 --> 28:18.000]  and at the same time say it doesn't exist
[28:18.000 --> 28:22.000]  that's like people they would march into the shooting ranges at the death camps
[28:22.000 --> 28:24.000]  into those pits, those mass graves
[28:24.000 --> 28:28.000]  and they would see people run into the mass grave and shot
[28:28.000 --> 28:31.000]  and then they would wait and they would say run in there now
[28:31.000 --> 28:33.000]  and they would say go and give them the order
[28:33.000 --> 28:36.000]  and they'd run into the pit and follow orders
[28:36.000 --> 28:39.000]  and that's what the American people have turned into
[28:39.000 --> 28:42.000]  we're running into the pit for the fellow reserve to rapist
[28:42.000 --> 28:44.000]  we're running into the pit for the police state
[28:44.000 --> 28:47.000]  we're running into the pit for our nation's borders to be destroyed
[28:47.000 --> 28:50.000]  we're running into the pit drinking the sodium fluoride water
[28:50.000 --> 28:54.000]  we're running into the mass grave pit taking the inoculations
[28:54.000 --> 28:56.000]  and on and on and on
[28:56.000 --> 28:58.000]  we're running into the pit accepting the news
[28:58.000 --> 29:00.000]  saying torture of children in front of their parents is good
[29:00.000 --> 29:03.000]  and pro-america and pro-freedom
[29:03.000 --> 29:05.000]  we're running into the pit accepting evil
[29:05.000 --> 29:07.000]  when you accept that all Bill Clinton lies
[29:07.000 --> 29:09.000]  George Bush lies, Obama lies
[29:09.000 --> 29:11.000]  you know that's just what they do
[29:11.000 --> 29:14.000]  you've now capitulated, you've now given in
[29:14.000 --> 29:17.000]  when you give in it's over
[29:17.000 --> 29:19.000]  and it's because you've lost your fighting spirit
[29:19.000 --> 29:21.000]  your fighting spirit to make war
[29:21.000 --> 29:23.000]  and to fight and to speak out and to step up
[29:23.000 --> 29:27.000]  is meant to protect your tribe and your family
[29:27.000 --> 29:31.000]  but see men have had all their manly energy
[29:31.000 --> 29:34.000]  secreted and misdirected into sports
[29:34.000 --> 29:38.000]  as Homer said thousands of years ago
[29:38.000 --> 29:41.000]  and so you're busy playing child's games
[29:41.000 --> 29:45.000]  while the new world order wages real war on humanity
[29:45.000 --> 29:47.000]  see they're living in the real world
[29:47.000 --> 29:50.000]  they live, we sleep, awaken
[29:50.000 --> 29:54.000]  we're on the march, the empire's on the run

[31:02.000 --> 31:04.000]  and I want each of you to ask yourself this question
[31:04.000 --> 31:06.000]  do you really know what's in your tap water?
[31:06.000 --> 31:10.000]  in a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor
[31:10.000 --> 31:13.000]  they found that over 260 chemicals in pollutants
[31:13.000 --> 31:15.000]  are present in municipal drinking water
[31:15.000 --> 31:17.000]  many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer
[31:17.000 --> 31:20.000]  reproductive, immune and developmental system diseases
[31:20.000 --> 31:22.000]  now what are you going to do about it?

[31:27.000 --> 31:29.000]  of you and your family's drinking water

[31:32.000 --> 31:34.000]  from the humidity in the atmosphere
[31:34.000 --> 31:36.000]  and uses state of the art carbon filtration
[31:36.000 --> 31:37.000]  reverse osmosis
[31:37.000 --> 31:40.000]  and ultra violent light sterilization techniques

[31:58.000 --> 32:14.000]  Hi this is Alex Jones did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[32:14.000 --> 32:19.000]  did you know that in a real meltdown non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[32:19.000 --> 32:23.000]  it's true seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country
[32:23.000 --> 32:25.000]  and it's possible that could even happen again
[32:25.000 --> 32:30.000]  and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient dense food for you and your family
[32:30.000 --> 32:34.000]  and here's the best part these seeds have not been genetically modified in any way
[32:34.000 --> 32:38.000]  and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden
[32:38.000 --> 32:41.000]  so visit them today at survivalseedbank.com
[32:41.000 --> 32:43.000]  that's survivalseedbank.com
[32:43.000 --> 32:48.000]  or give them a call at 877-327-0365
[32:48.000 --> 32:52.000]  that's 877-327-0365
[32:52.000 --> 32:57.000]  remember in a real crisis non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item
[32:57.000 --> 33:00.000]  this is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com
[33:00.000 --> 33:22.000]  We will not be forgotten, we won't be left behind, our memories live on for a while
[33:22.000 --> 33:31.000]  I am a Midwest farmer, I make a living off the land, I ride a John Deere tractor, I'm a liberated man
[33:31.000 --> 33:36.000]  but the rain hasn't fallen since the middle of July
[33:36.000 --> 33:41.000]  and if it don't come soon my crops will die
[33:41.000 --> 33:46.000]  the bankman says he likes me but there's nothing he can do
[33:46.000 --> 33:50.000]  he tells me that he's coming but the clouds are coming too
[33:50.000 --> 33:55.000]  he ain't my friend, I'll ride again
[33:55.000 --> 33:57.000]  and I'll ride again
[33:57.000 --> 34:00.000]  don't give up, don't let them break your spirit
[34:00.000 --> 34:05.000]  only let their attacks intensify the power of your heart and soul
[34:05.000 --> 34:10.000]  my forefathers loved this land and left it here for pain
[34:10.000 --> 34:13.000]  we got Wayne Paul coming up in an hour and a half
[34:13.000 --> 34:15.000]  I'm really looking forward to that
[34:15.000 --> 34:20.000]  General Stubblebine and Dr. Labo, very informative as well
[34:20.000 --> 34:27.000]  they are beginning the brainwashing for forest inoculations in Europe, England, the United States, Canada, Australia, everywhere
[34:27.000 --> 34:30.000]  I've got a disgusting local newscast I want to break down and analyze
[34:30.000 --> 34:34.000]  coming up later as well in the next hour
[34:34.000 --> 34:38.000]  I do want to go ahead and just fire out the toll-free phone number
[34:38.000 --> 34:42.000]  because I'm going to start taking calls at the beginning of the next hour
[34:42.000 --> 34:46.000]  covering a blitzkrieg of news, and boy is it all important
[34:46.000 --> 34:54.000]  1-800-259-9231, 1-800-259-9231
[34:54.000 --> 34:58.000]  but as they say, once more into the breach
[34:58.000 --> 35:03.000]  and so into the valley of death, road 600
[35:03.000 --> 35:12.000]  forget who said that, I don't know, part of it's Shakespeare
[35:12.000 --> 35:20.000]  you know, constantly at night and in the morning I write notes about thoughts and points I want to make
[35:20.000 --> 35:22.000]  and it needs to be done
[35:22.000 --> 35:27.000]  you can talk about some of these issues, larger issues
[35:27.000 --> 35:31.000]  overall philosophy issues
[35:31.000 --> 35:35.000]  but I assure you, new listeners
[35:35.000 --> 35:38.000]  if you will simply follow your instincts
[35:38.000 --> 35:40.000]  because I know what your gut's telling you right now
[35:40.000 --> 35:42.000]  it's telling you I'm telling you the truth
[35:42.000 --> 35:44.000]  because I do tell the truth
[35:44.000 --> 35:47.000]  and I do my research
[35:47.000 --> 35:49.000]  does that mean I always get it right?
[35:49.000 --> 35:51.000]  no
[35:51.000 --> 35:53.000]  but I try to get it right
[35:53.000 --> 35:56.000]  and we're frighteningly accurate here, I'd say
[35:56.000 --> 36:00.000]  95% plus
[36:00.000 --> 36:03.000]  I was about to say 98, but it sounds obnoxious
[36:03.000 --> 36:07.000]  it's above 95% accuracy
[36:07.000 --> 36:15.000]  most of our inaccuracy is underestimating evil
[36:15.000 --> 36:19.000]  it's hard for me to imagine that there are
[36:19.000 --> 36:23.000]  hundreds of thousands of people conservatively, sociologists and psychologists
[36:23.000 --> 36:28.000]  and criminologists predict
[36:28.000 --> 36:30.000]  bare minimum, in the world
[36:30.000 --> 36:32.000]  hundreds of thousands, probably more
[36:32.000 --> 36:43.000]  that enjoy kidnapping little children and torturing them to death for weeks and then killing them
[36:43.000 --> 36:47.000]  that is hard
[36:47.000 --> 36:51.000]  for me to imagine that there are people
[36:51.000 --> 36:57.000]  who enjoy torturing innocent people to death
[36:57.000 --> 37:02.000]  but just because that is 180 degrees alien
[37:02.000 --> 37:05.000]  from what most of us believe in
[37:05.000 --> 37:08.000]  in what most of us love
[37:08.000 --> 37:10.000]  and what most of us like
[37:10.000 --> 37:12.000]  and what most of our taste are
[37:12.000 --> 37:18.000]  nevertheless, those individuals are amongst us
[37:18.000 --> 37:25.000]  and there's different debates on it
[37:25.000 --> 37:28.000]  different psychological reports that have been done on it
[37:28.000 --> 37:31.000]  some quackery, some quite accurate
[37:31.000 --> 37:38.000]  some estimates have as many as two psychopaths for every hundred people
[37:38.000 --> 37:45.000]  most of the studies show on average about one psychopath per every hundred people
[37:45.000 --> 37:49.000]  and guess how many sociopaths there are for every hundred
[37:49.000 --> 37:54.000]  some gauges have 20%
[37:54.000 --> 37:56.000]  sociopaths
[37:56.000 --> 37:58.000]  that is they don't enjoy killing you
[37:58.000 --> 38:00.000]  they just don't care if you die
[38:00.000 --> 38:02.000]  see a psychopath enjoys it
[38:02.000 --> 38:15.000]  and enjoys the power trip of it
[38:15.000 --> 38:17.000]  and so what you had is psychopaths
[38:17.000 --> 38:21.000]  high functioning psychopaths
[38:21.000 --> 38:26.000]  in command of legions of sociopaths
[38:26.000 --> 38:32.000]  the psychopaths also command legions of
[38:32.000 --> 38:34.000]  people that like to be enslaved
[38:34.000 --> 38:37.000]  and people that like to serve psychopaths
[38:37.000 --> 38:40.000]  the whip me beat me types
[38:40.000 --> 38:43.000]  like many of their most dangerous operatives
[38:43.000 --> 38:53.000]  are the chicken neck ghoul variety that I show loathe
[38:53.000 --> 38:56.000]  and then of course they have the sadistic sadist
[38:56.000 --> 39:01.000]  they have armies of them
[39:01.000 --> 39:04.000]  and they operate the virus of tyranny
[39:04.000 --> 39:13.000]  and operates best in a fat and decadent
[39:13.000 --> 39:17.000]  spoiled environment
[39:17.000 --> 39:20.000]  and boy in America the epitome of that
[39:20.000 --> 39:22.000]  fat dumb and happy
[39:22.000 --> 39:29.000]  it's like rotten stagnant water that you've pumped a thousand gallons of fresh sewage into
[39:29.000 --> 39:32.000]  oh it's already full of bacteria and filth
[39:32.000 --> 39:43.000]  it's going to become pure cess sludge
[39:43.000 --> 39:46.000]  pure detritus
[39:46.000 --> 39:48.000]  liquid E. coli
[39:48.000 --> 39:50.000]  liquid death
[39:50.000 --> 39:54.000]  only the new world order would come up
[39:54.000 --> 39:56.000]  with an artificial sweetener
[39:56.000 --> 39:58.000]  that rots holes in your brains
[39:58.000 --> 40:00.000]  kills your cells and mash
[40:00.000 --> 40:03.000]  every organ attacks your pancreas
[40:03.000 --> 40:10.000]  and is the defecation of genetically engineered E. coli bacteria
[40:10.000 --> 40:13.000]  only the new world order would come up with that
[40:13.000 --> 40:16.000]  and everything they do is a wicked invention
[40:16.000 --> 40:19.000]  they are creators
[40:19.000 --> 40:21.000]  they mimic God
[40:21.000 --> 40:25.000]  they counterfeit God but in a twisted
[40:25.000 --> 40:32.000]  stinking way
[40:32.000 --> 40:35.000]  what they do
[40:35.000 --> 40:39.000]  they are creators
[40:39.000 --> 40:42.000]  made in the image of the creator of the universe
[40:42.000 --> 40:44.000]  but twisted and dark
[40:44.000 --> 40:45.000]  with a dark logic
[40:45.000 --> 40:47.000]  a different science
[40:47.000 --> 40:51.000]  a different language of mathematics
[40:51.000 --> 40:54.000]  they come from the gulfs
[40:54.000 --> 40:59.000]  black gulfs of
[40:59.000 --> 41:04.000]  pain and suffering
[41:04.000 --> 41:06.000]  they hate the light
[41:06.000 --> 41:09.000]  so they seek to tear it down to topple it
[41:09.000 --> 41:15.000]  to overturn it
[41:15.000 --> 41:18.000]  psychopaths and I've interviewed some of the top
[41:18.000 --> 41:21.000]  psychiatrists that have interviewed some of the most famous psychopaths here on air
[41:21.000 --> 41:25.000]  I forget that lady's name, we need to get her back on when interviewed all the psychos
[41:25.000 --> 41:28.000]  and her on years ago it was amazing
[41:28.000 --> 41:30.000]  I've got to create a list of all these powerful guests
[41:30.000 --> 41:32.000]  and we have them on once and we have them on again
[41:32.000 --> 41:35.000]  and she was describing
[41:35.000 --> 41:41.000]  what the best cinema description of it
[41:41.000 --> 41:44.000]  would be the remake of the Manchurian candidate
[41:44.000 --> 41:46.000]  that whenever he goes under mind control
[41:46.000 --> 41:48.000]  everything kind of glows
[41:48.000 --> 41:49.000]  everything's like brilliant
[41:49.000 --> 41:51.000]  he feels totally alive
[41:51.000 --> 41:53.000]  whenever they give him the program words
[41:53.000 --> 41:55.000]  everything blazes
[41:55.000 --> 42:00.000]  and a psychopath is depressed and unhappy and upset
[42:00.000 --> 42:03.000]  generally
[42:03.000 --> 42:07.000]  and only feels alive when they've got a child chained down
[42:07.000 --> 42:10.000]  burning them with cigarettes and electrical wires
[42:10.000 --> 42:13.000]  and torturing them and begging and hearing them sob for their mother
[42:13.000 --> 42:15.000]  it's like blazing burning light
[42:15.000 --> 42:16.000]  it's like life
[42:16.000 --> 42:17.000]  oh it's beautiful
[42:17.000 --> 42:21.000]  while they're killing the goodness and the innocence
[42:21.000 --> 42:25.000]  so you want to know why Bill Gates is so happy
[42:25.000 --> 42:31.000]  he's one of the biggest eugenicists in history folks
[42:31.000 --> 42:33.000]  I think it's a fair estimate to say
[42:33.000 --> 42:35.000]  his tens of billions worldwide for eugenics
[42:35.000 --> 42:37.000]  has probably got more megadeths under his belt
[42:37.000 --> 42:39.000]  than Adolf A. Lewis Hitler
[42:39.000 --> 42:43.000]  I don't think he has Mao championed yet
[42:43.000 --> 42:45.000]  but he'll get there
[42:45.000 --> 42:50.000]  he's as happy as a pig and you know what
[42:50.000 --> 42:53.000]  and he likes it
[42:53.000 --> 42:56.000]  and he's organized and he's focused and he's professional
[42:56.000 --> 42:57.000]  and he's laughing at you
[42:57.000 --> 42:59.000]  and he understands sociology and psychology
[42:59.000 --> 43:00.000]  and he enjoys it
[43:00.000 --> 43:02.000]  he enjoys walking through an airport
[43:02.000 --> 43:03.000]  and just looking at everybody
[43:03.000 --> 43:05.000]  he's running black ops on
[43:05.000 --> 43:07.000]  it's a little special secret to him
[43:07.000 --> 43:12.000]  he is to the power of infinity
[43:12.000 --> 43:15.000]  a dark type of the punk busboy
[43:15.000 --> 43:20.000]  who puts a booger in somebody's fettuccine Alfredo
[43:20.000 --> 43:25.000]  and I've seen a busboy do that
[43:25.000 --> 43:27.000]  I saw him in a little dark hallway from my table
[43:27.000 --> 43:30.000]  looking back where the plates were being put up
[43:30.000 --> 43:32.000]  steaming for the people
[43:32.000 --> 43:34.000]  maybe somebody had given him a weird look
[43:34.000 --> 43:36.000]  because he was so insecure and neurotic
[43:36.000 --> 43:38.000]  and just a biological android
[43:38.000 --> 43:42.000]  a subwayed demon
[43:42.000 --> 43:44.000]  and he had that power to stick his finger in his nose
[43:44.000 --> 43:46.000]  and to stick that booger right in that food
[43:46.000 --> 43:48.000]  and that's what Bill Gates is
[43:48.000 --> 43:55.000]  but a giant, powerful, spoiled, wicked little busboy
[43:55.000 --> 43:57.000]  and he's going to stick sodium fluoride in your water
[43:57.000 --> 43:59.000]  he's going to give you special shots
[43:59.000 --> 44:01.000]  that are going to make you feel real good
[44:01.000 --> 44:05.000]  because he is a smiley face demon-eyed
[44:05.000 --> 44:06.000]  right out of the pit of hell
[44:06.000 --> 44:10.000]  I swear eternal resistance to you
[44:10.000 --> 44:13.000]  and I spend my life and I spend my fortune
[44:13.000 --> 44:17.000]  I spend my soul and my energy
[44:17.000 --> 44:23.000]  ramming straight into you with everything I got
[44:23.000 --> 44:30.000]  damn the maneuvers, I'm going straight at you
[44:30.000 --> 44:35.000]  and I'm committed you little devil in disguise
[44:35.000 --> 45:00.000]  Now the issue to men out there is
[45:00.000 --> 45:04.000]  some of the more dominant greek city states
[45:04.000 --> 45:11.660]  were tired of the city-states killing each other, and they decided to focus their activities
[45:11.660 --> 45:18.660]  outward, and it's at that time that the state inculcated sports into daily life so that
[45:18.660 --> 45:28.580]  the men wouldn't kill each other, because that was the object of human development.
[45:28.580 --> 45:32.180]  That was the object of showing your will.
[45:32.180 --> 45:33.340]  It was the great contest.
[45:33.340 --> 45:37.180]  It was what focused the mind.
[45:37.180 --> 45:41.460]  You get in an arena with somebody with a short sword and a little shield, believe me, everything
[45:41.460 --> 45:48.520]  goes very slow, life is very real, the sand sparkles, the sky gleams.
[45:48.520 --> 45:49.620]  You are totally alive.
[45:49.620 --> 45:58.400]  It is another mirror into what the psychopath is seeing, but much, much deeper and more real.
[45:58.400 --> 46:02.220]  Because it's not some child chained down to a bed having their teeth pulled out.
[46:02.220 --> 46:09.340]  It is a vicious man rippling with muscles in focus who is going to kill you, and it
[46:09.340 --> 46:15.580]  is real, and it is an animating contest of liberty.
[46:15.580 --> 46:19.940]  Who will survive?
[46:19.940 --> 46:23.660]  And so that's why you go paint yourself up in war paint and yell and scream at a football
[46:23.660 --> 46:28.180]  game, and it's not even bad enough itself, except that you're not in the arena.
[46:28.180 --> 46:33.820]  You are now learning to live through other men and through other women instead of being
[46:33.820 --> 46:34.820]  in the arena yourself.
[46:34.820 --> 46:39.620]  And let me tell you what those instincts for war and strength and what those instincts
[46:39.620 --> 46:41.780]  to get up in front of a crowd are for.
[46:41.780 --> 46:46.940]  It is for leadership to defend the women and children.
[46:46.940 --> 46:51.980]  But as societies got larger and became agrarian and as city-states were developed, then it
[46:51.980 --> 46:57.260]  was more sophisticated and more mechanized to have war with your neighbor and survive
[46:57.260 --> 47:00.220]  and it became a science.
[47:00.220 --> 47:04.700]  And then the science of war became light years more sophisticated than it was thousands
[47:04.700 --> 47:06.140]  of years ago.
[47:06.140 --> 47:14.300]  Toward now, the directed energies of the system or the overclass using the entire scientific
[47:14.300 --> 47:22.220]  funding mechanisms of the nation-states to form a world government that then destroys
[47:22.220 --> 47:28.140]  the nation-states and brings in a planetary regime of oppression and control and sterilization
[47:28.140 --> 47:33.660]  and micro-management, a hellish global regime where everything you do and say and speak
[47:33.660 --> 47:39.700]  and own is chronicled, where societies are squeezed and trampled and herded into control
[47:39.700 --> 47:43.180]  grids, into culling pins.
[47:43.180 --> 47:49.420]  And everything I've told you over these years has now been said by Pelosi and said by Holdren
[47:49.420 --> 47:52.820]  the the czar over science.
[47:52.820 --> 48:00.780]  These bastards publish full-length textbooks detailing the Grizzly operation.
[48:00.780 --> 48:05.220]  Everything I've said has been validated.
[48:05.220 --> 48:11.460]  Now four books he's contributed to or that he wrote in total have now emerged.
[48:11.460 --> 48:16.420]  In total, 3,000 nightmare pages plus that must be read.
[48:16.420 --> 48:19.700]  Each new page, a Grizzly horror show.
[48:19.700 --> 48:20.700]  You know why?
[48:20.700 --> 48:26.100]  Because this isn't some nut, some recluse in a backwoods cabin saying this.
[48:26.100 --> 48:27.620]  This is the elite.
[48:27.620 --> 48:34.340]  He has been chosen because his textbook, and I've now read over 400 pages of it, has been
[48:34.340 --> 48:35.340]  adopted.
[48:35.340 --> 48:37.140]  He is honored.
[48:37.140 --> 48:41.580]  They all compete with different plans that are very similar and to fine-tune the current
[48:41.580 --> 48:48.380]  eugenics operations and his plan, along with Erlich, who also advised Bush, they co-authored
[48:48.380 --> 48:56.020]  the book together, has been adopted.
[48:56.020 --> 49:00.300]  And so when you see headlines like Bill Gates wants to control the weather to save the earth
[49:00.300 --> 49:05.420]  from global warming, see, everything's going to be converted to this fake survival mechanism.
[49:05.420 --> 49:07.820]  They know you're designed and built around defense.
[49:07.820 --> 49:11.380]  So they create fake wars that are actually meant to destroy you.
[49:11.380 --> 49:14.460]  They create the fake terrorist, or they fund real terrorists.
[49:14.460 --> 49:17.820]  They create the fake environmental movement, the tax carbon that is part of the entire
[49:17.820 --> 49:21.140]  life cycle in all industry and all life and what you exhale, two and a half pounds of
[49:21.140 --> 49:22.540]  a day.
[49:22.540 --> 49:27.380]  They create a fake climate system where they then use the very climate machines they've
[49:27.380 --> 49:32.660]  created to hurt the environment, create droughts, create floods and freak weather, and then
[49:32.660 --> 49:37.300]  you fund them to publicly fight what they've created.
[49:37.300 --> 49:44.300]  We'll come back, finish up with this, and go through a lot more on the other side.
[50:07.300 --> 50:18.300]  That's how you lie to me, you're not the way you seem, you look like an angel, walk like
[50:18.300 --> 50:32.300]  an angel, talk like an angel, but I got wise, you're the devil in disguise, oh yes, you
[50:32.300 --> 50:38.300]  are wise folks, not cute getting suckered, not cute clinging to the tyranny.
[50:38.300 --> 50:48.300]  I thought that I was in heaven, but I was sure surprised, heaven held me, I didn't see
[50:48.300 --> 51:01.300]  the devil in your eyes, you look like an angel, walk like an angel, walk like an angel.
[51:01.300 --> 51:04.740]  They have shown that many people do not get the proper vitamins and minerals necessary

[54:48.180 --> 54:53.220]  They want to continually the shopping malls open, the green hills, the blue sky, the happy
[54:53.220 --> 55:00.020]  girls, the football games, as the background noise of police guarding themselves in black
[55:00.020 --> 55:04.740]  uniforms and masks begin to march. As the citizen squads are formed, as the foreign
[55:04.740 --> 55:12.100]  troops drill, as the banks bankrupt the society, the FEMA camps are to be introduced as places
[55:12.100 --> 55:19.500]  of refuge, places you want to go, the free medical care. They make you fear the flu so
[55:19.500 --> 55:25.620]  you willingly come to them and willingly show the vampires your neck as they sink their
[55:25.620 --> 55:35.700]  fangs into the warm flesh. They hypnotize, they have you lower your defenses, steal your
[55:35.700 --> 55:44.900]  heart, fire up your soul like a giant jet engine and rise against the tyranny. Break
[55:44.900 --> 55:56.420]  the chains, awaken the reality, awaken to the good, the bad, and the ugly. Know the
[55:56.420 --> 56:05.380]  truth, the whole of it. If you make the decision to put one foot in front of the other and
[56:05.380 --> 56:11.780]  ask God to put you on the journey to truth, he will be given the discernment. He will
[56:11.780 --> 56:20.220]  have the veils lifted. He will be given great knowledge, but only if it is to be used to
[56:20.220 --> 56:27.900]  stand against the tyranny to warn your fellow men and women everywhere. I call on the leaders.
[56:27.900 --> 56:34.180]  I call on those of you who from the day you were born, from the time you were formed in
[56:34.180 --> 56:41.300]  your mother's womb, the creator of the universe and all the dimensions and all that is and
[56:41.300 --> 56:51.660]  will ever be. The I am that I am has a mission for you, but you were given free will so you
[56:51.660 --> 56:58.500]  have to take that mission up in your hands. You have to face the fear of the great dog
[56:58.500 --> 57:04.340]  that roars on the field and an attempt to stifle your will. You have to stand against
[57:04.340 --> 57:10.260]  the new world order. You have to resist it. You have to go through the fire and commit
[57:10.260 --> 57:18.060]  even unto death, even unto imprisonment to sacrifice yourself in this holy cause of
[57:18.060 --> 57:26.540]  liberty and freedom. You must pledge yourself on the altar of freedom. You must commit your
[57:26.540 --> 57:35.660]  entire being and pledge eternal resistance to tyranny. Only now at this point will you
[57:35.660 --> 57:55.420]  be ready to take up your destiny. Now he sees it won't be as it lies to see. We live on.
[57:55.420 --> 58:04.460]  For whom the bell tolls. You are part of history. You are destiny. The very fact that you found

[1:00:15.780 --> 1:00:33.780]  Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones. We are now in to our number
[1:00:33.780 --> 1:00:37.820]  two, Wayne Vaughan, brother of Ron Vaughan, great political activist in his own right.
[1:00:37.820 --> 1:00:44.420]  He's in the Obama deception. He'll be joining us in T-minus 59 minutes, 18 seconds. We have
[1:00:44.420 --> 1:00:50.740]  Dr. Rema E. Labo and her husband, Albert, in stubble line, the third major general joining
[1:00:50.740 --> 1:00:56.340]  us. We're talking about the soft kill slaughter grid that we're all entering into right now.
[1:00:56.340 --> 1:01:04.940]  That is coming up in the final hour. Truth is stranger than fiction. As I said last hour,
[1:01:04.940 --> 1:01:14.580]  look in your heart, look in your guts, look in your soul and realize that we are living
[1:01:14.580 --> 1:01:19.580]  on a beautiful planet with just wondrous opportunities all around us. But if we don't recognize
[1:01:19.580 --> 1:01:25.180]  the evil and fight it, it will take over. I'm a very positive person. I'm in love with
[1:01:25.180 --> 1:01:30.820]  life, in love with everything, except that which kills life, that which pulls down beauty.
[1:01:30.820 --> 1:01:39.580]  And it's got to be met. It met it is being. All right, look, I'm going to take calls for
[1:01:39.580 --> 1:01:42.420]  30 minutes and I'm going to get back into this key breakdown of points. I want to make
[1:01:42.420 --> 1:01:47.100]  a ton of news that I haven't even gotten to yet. But right now, let's go ahead and start
[1:01:47.100 --> 1:01:51.100]  taking your calls. Dave in California, you're on the air worldwide, Dave.
[1:01:51.100 --> 1:01:56.980]  Hello, hello, Alex. Can you hear me? Yes, I can. Perfect day. First off, great, a great
[1:01:56.980 --> 1:02:01.140]  show. I appreciate the job you do. You do a fantastic job every day. I agree with about
[1:02:01.140 --> 1:02:05.860]  98% of everything that you say. I think you're right on target for most of it. I was wondering
[1:02:05.860 --> 1:02:12.180]  if you were aware that Henry Paulson was on the hill today being grilled by Congressman
[1:02:12.180 --> 1:02:19.220]  over the tarp. I heard he was going to be testifying, but no, what happened? Well, pretty
[1:02:19.220 --> 1:02:26.940]  much all the Democrats and Republicans across the board were equally grillative, I guess,
[1:02:26.940 --> 1:02:35.860]  that nobody gave him much slack. Dennis Kucinich's main point was, you know, Ken Lewis didn't
[1:02:35.860 --> 1:02:42.460]  inform, as the SEC requires, Ken Lewis did not inform the shareholders of Bank of America
[1:02:42.460 --> 1:02:46.260]  about what he was doing until after he did it. Well, I mean, they are criminally vertically
[1:02:46.260 --> 1:02:52.300]  integrating the society and the Federal Reserve, which Bank of America holds stock in, ordered
[1:02:52.300 --> 1:02:57.380]  them to do that. But see, that's the false left-right paradigm or a fake choice split
[1:02:57.380 --> 1:03:01.660]  is what they're doing. Bank of America is in this up to their eyeballs. They're just
[1:03:01.660 --> 1:03:08.180]  blaming it on the political guy that's already gone. So that by him being a sacrificial goat,
[1:03:08.180 --> 1:03:12.780]  it then passes everything else through the veil so they can move on, kind of like they're
[1:03:12.780 --> 1:03:17.340]  burning Cheney a little bit right now, but they're just going to give them a golden brown
[1:03:17.340 --> 1:03:21.660]  cooking, not anything that actually hurts him, so that they can make Obama look good
[1:03:21.660 --> 1:03:25.900]  and energize partisan politics. But yes, go ahead.
[1:03:25.900 --> 1:03:30.580]  I think what they do to Cheney, though, strictly depends a lot. Much of it depends on what
[1:03:30.580 --> 1:03:37.740]  we do. The grassroots movement was vocal enough and said, look, this man was involved up to
[1:03:37.740 --> 1:03:43.940]  his earlobes in all sorts of crimes. We need him prosecuted. I don't think Obama, even
[1:03:43.940 --> 1:03:52.260]  no matter how bottom-sold he is, can avoid having the masses. Yes, if we could get him
[1:03:52.260 --> 1:03:56.420]  indicted or get him in deep trouble, that would then send a message to all these black
[1:03:56.420 --> 1:03:59.700]  ops and people, you're not going to get away with torture and murder of innocent people
[1:03:59.700 --> 1:04:04.940]  and warrantless wiretapping. But if it's just about blaming everything on Cheney and piling
[1:04:04.940 --> 1:04:11.900]  all the sins on him, he's just a high-level corporate function area CEO type. And so if
[1:04:11.900 --> 1:04:17.420]  we act like all the evil emanated out of Cheney, it becomes a birdcage liner. I want
[1:04:17.420 --> 1:04:23.140]  to talk about the bird that's crapping all over us instead of Bill Clinton or Dick Cheney
[1:04:23.140 --> 1:04:27.780]  or Barack Obama who are just birdcage liners. Instead of talking about the birdcage liner,
[1:04:27.780 --> 1:04:31.900]  I want to talk about the bird. David Rockefeller, Queen of England, the Rothschilds, all this
[1:04:31.900 --> 1:04:35.740]  scum. That's who I want to talk about. I want to bring them to justice. I want them to get
[1:04:35.740 --> 1:04:39.700]  in trouble. And it's talking about these guys that need to get in trouble is what will actually
[1:04:39.700 --> 1:04:43.820]  send hit squads out. But I don't care. Like I said, I'm going right at them. And yeah,
[1:04:43.820 --> 1:04:47.140]  the whole Cheney thing is very interesting. And it's important that it comes out because
[1:04:47.140 --> 1:04:51.340]  it shows what complete criminals the government is and how illegitimate they are.
[1:04:51.340 --> 1:04:54.980]  I think, you know, he would be a figurehead otherwise.
[1:04:54.980 --> 1:05:00.060]  Yeah. Yeah. I hear you. I appreciate your call. Good points there, David. We'll take
[1:05:00.060 --> 1:05:01.060]  more calls.
[1:05:01.060 --> 1:05:05.100]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator
[1:05:05.100 --> 1:05:09.340]  this summer. Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric
[1:05:09.340 --> 1:05:14.580]  bill. Number two, our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company
[1:05:14.580 --> 1:05:19.300]  allows you to have. It's true. Total government control of electricity in the name of smart
[1:05:19.300 --> 1:05:23.700]  grid technology is coming. Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid
[1:05:23.700 --> 1:05:27.500]  is dangerously overloaded, especially with the high demand summer months ahead. Number
[1:05:27.500 --> 1:05:31.780]  four, the hurricane and dangerous summer storm season is here again. Every year, thousands

[1:08:00.900 --> 1:08:06.820]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones show because there's
[1:08:06.820 --> 1:08:20.940]  a war on for your mind. By the way, a point I've been meaning to make for months. This
[1:08:20.940 --> 1:08:27.820]  whole last session of Congress, especially in the house, we've been taping it all for
[1:08:27.820 --> 1:08:32.860]  the Obama film, going through all the video, all the different lines of the seat, it's
[1:08:32.860 --> 1:08:41.020]  unbelievable. And I've been watching Congress since high school, you know, we had cable
[1:08:41.020 --> 1:08:53.860]  and C-span. I've been watching C-span since I was about 14 years old. So that's a while.
[1:08:53.860 --> 1:09:02.540]  And I guess more than 20 years. And so I know a little bit about the procedure. It's very
[1:09:02.540 --> 1:09:09.580]  Byzantine. They're always changing house rules, but I know the basics more than most.
[1:09:09.580 --> 1:09:16.300]  And the Democrats, and I've watched Republican and Democrat alike, have never acted like
[1:09:16.300 --> 1:09:24.380]  this. Neither party has. The Democrats are breaking all the rules. They are engaging
[1:09:24.380 --> 1:09:29.020]  in fake votes. They are cheating. They are voting more than once. They are not letting
[1:09:29.020 --> 1:09:35.580]  people see bills. I mean, in the past, they would release a bill an hour or two before.
[1:09:35.580 --> 1:09:40.780]  Now they put one copy out and say, we're calling the vote. And then the leader of the Republicans
[1:09:40.780 --> 1:09:46.140]  has to get up and do a House filibuster just to be able to read it. He gets up and says,
[1:09:46.140 --> 1:09:51.300]  okay, I just got this five minutes ago. I'm blocking the vote. I'm just going to stay
[1:09:51.300 --> 1:09:56.300]  up here and talk. And there's not really a filibuster in the House unless you're a leader,
[1:09:56.300 --> 1:10:00.620]  but then you can have an unlimited filibuster. But I was just in there during the break in
[1:10:00.620 --> 1:10:13.020]  the coffee room, drinking from the coffee pot, my last vice, like a bear climbing into a
[1:10:13.020 --> 1:10:17.220]  honey bottle, honey jar. But the point is, I'm in there watching it and they had just
[1:10:17.220 --> 1:10:21.540]  a big vote. There's all this booing and yelling and they're just ignoring all the procedures
[1:10:21.540 --> 1:10:26.020]  and the vote had been voted down and then they opened it back up for vote, which you're
[1:10:26.020 --> 1:10:33.620]  not supposed to be able to do. And then it looks like there's more votes for it than
[1:10:33.620 --> 1:10:37.340]  there are actual Democrats, but they can't find Republicans that voted for it. There's
[1:10:37.340 --> 1:10:45.940]  this big fight going on. I had to come back in here on air, but what the issue is that
[1:10:45.940 --> 1:10:49.100]  they say to the speaker, I would like to see the bill and they go, you may see the bill
[1:10:49.100 --> 1:10:53.620]  and they go, where is it? I will not tell you. I mean, I have this on video from back
[1:10:53.620 --> 1:10:59.020]  during the climate carbon tax bill they passed a week and a half ago and they say, I can't
[1:10:59.020 --> 1:11:05.180]  see it and they go, you may see it and they go, but it's not here. They go, where is it?
[1:11:05.180 --> 1:11:13.100]  I will not tell you. And then they just laugh at them. I mean, it's just, ladies and gentlemen,
[1:11:13.100 --> 1:11:18.100]  they've given the politicians the orders go for broke, rob everybody, steal everything,
[1:11:18.100 --> 1:11:24.020]  including the kitchen sink and whatever's nailed down. Go for broke. There's not going
[1:11:24.020 --> 1:11:27.860]  to be anything left. Get enough money for your own private island. We're bringing America
[1:11:27.860 --> 1:11:32.020]  down. I mean, they are taking over the, getting rid of the borders. They are taking over healthcare.
[1:11:32.020 --> 1:11:36.100]  They're passing all sorts of new taxes. They're saying they're going to raise taxes on everybody,
[1:11:36.100 --> 1:11:39.300]  breaking that pledge. Obama's people saying he never pledged that, even though we have
[1:11:39.300 --> 1:11:45.700]  literally, I don't know, I stopped at 20 plus videos of him saying, I pledge not one tax
[1:11:45.700 --> 1:11:52.380]  will be raised above $250,000 a year and a two person family over $125,000 a year individual.
[1:11:52.380 --> 1:11:58.180]  And now he's saying, I never said that. I mean, it's just, you think Bill Clinton's
[1:11:58.180 --> 1:12:03.020]  bad, you think George Bush is bad and the re, and I've had a lot of expert guests on
[1:12:03.020 --> 1:12:08.060]  who I agree with. It's not even that Obama's much worse than them. It's that we're further
[1:12:08.060 --> 1:12:13.800]  down in the progression of this tyranny and they are, it's kind of like if you've already
[1:12:13.800 --> 1:12:18.260]  robbed four or five banks, you've already shot a security guard and then shot a cop and
[1:12:18.260 --> 1:12:22.660]  shot a teller and you've already got a death sentence hanging over your head. You know,
[1:12:22.660 --> 1:12:29.340]  you're going to the electric chair, you know, you're going to the lethal injection and you
[1:12:29.340 --> 1:12:34.140]  might as well just rob, steal, kill, do whatever you want. I mean, kill one cop, kill five
[1:12:34.140 --> 1:12:42.140]  cops. You know, it's just go for broke, wild, steal everything, do whatever you want. And
[1:12:42.140 --> 1:12:46.100]  that's why they're defending corrupt cops now that kill innocent people and they're
[1:12:46.100 --> 1:12:50.060]  defending corrupt politicians that get caught doing bad things. I mean, it's open season
[1:12:50.060 --> 1:12:55.740]  folks. Open season is the word. Open season on our republic, on our freedoms and just
[1:12:55.740 --> 1:13:01.420]  a gang of criminals are robbing everything. And you do see a few good congressman on
[1:13:01.420 --> 1:13:05.620]  the independent side, on the Republican side, and a few only even on the Democrat, you
[1:13:05.620 --> 1:13:08.660]  know, even, even Cassinage could something says, you know, you're not following procedures.
[1:13:08.660 --> 1:13:16.220]  This is, this is wrong. There's one independent senator who's telling the truth and doing
[1:13:16.220 --> 1:13:22.140]  a good job. And there's a few Republicans. There's a Republican congressman I want to
[1:13:22.140 --> 1:13:28.540]  get on. I'm really getting impressed with from Texas. Louis, something I keep pronouncing
[1:13:28.540 --> 1:13:32.300]  as a name wrong. I've got to see it on screen and get it right. But he's always there fighting
[1:13:32.300 --> 1:13:39.340]  the bills and always right up front is being told to sit down and shut up by the pond scum.
[1:13:39.340 --> 1:13:44.980]  You know, they're always rotating different Democrats through the speakership position.
[1:13:44.980 --> 1:13:49.900]  And there's always these evil lawyers up there advising them on how to twist and manipulate.
[1:13:49.900 --> 1:13:58.100]  And I just want you to know that we're being gang raped right now politically. And I have
[1:13:58.100 --> 1:14:09.220]  watched the Congress for 20 plus years, just 21, 22 years. And I've never seen it. It looks
[1:14:09.220 --> 1:14:12.740]  like parliament where they're yelling and screaming and fighting. Parliament wasn't like that
[1:14:12.740 --> 1:14:18.020]  till about a hundred years ago. All decorum is gone. It's like South Korean parliament
[1:14:18.020 --> 1:14:22.460]  where they beat each other with canes on TV and choke each other on the Japanese diet
[1:14:22.460 --> 1:14:27.580]  sometimes when, you know, half those guys are in the Japanese mafia with tats all over
[1:14:27.580 --> 1:14:31.180]  them. You can't see it under their clothes. They start trying to kill each other in there.
[1:14:31.180 --> 1:14:34.900]  I mean, you know, that's basically what it's becoming. And you've just got these criminals
[1:14:34.900 --> 1:14:41.340]  up there and they don't care. They're just laughing and joking. And it's so funny. And
[1:14:41.340 --> 1:14:48.020]  they've got more than 20 anti gun bills, each one of them totally devastating worse than
[1:14:48.020 --> 1:15:04.820]  anything ever introduced or passed before. I mean, it is heavy. It is heavy duty. I should
[1:15:04.820 --> 1:15:10.980]  I take calls? We'll just go to them. But just know this, this is the LMO and the new order
[1:15:10.980 --> 1:15:16.380]  is coming over the walls. And the average Americans got the thumb in their mouth or
[1:15:16.380 --> 1:15:22.580]  somewhere else and they just don't even want to hear what's going on and just think it's
[1:15:22.580 --> 1:15:28.460]  all a big party. As most people I know are losing their jobs or getting pay cuts, society
[1:15:28.460 --> 1:15:36.700]  is unraveling at the edges. The federal government's trying to make veterans pay for their own
[1:15:36.700 --> 1:15:41.140]  health care. Now when they signed a contract, we're promised that. And then when we first
[1:15:41.140 --> 1:15:44.980]  started covering that bill listeners, we break a lot of news because listeners send us tips
[1:15:44.980 --> 1:15:48.860]  and things. And before the VFW came out and said it was criminal and before it was on
[1:15:48.860 --> 1:15:52.660]  the news, a few weeks before our listeners called and said, have you seen this? They're
[1:15:52.660 --> 1:15:58.460]  proposing making vets pay for their own health care. And years ago, I'd cover how they make
[1:15:58.460 --> 1:16:03.140]  vets pay for their own airline tickets back. They make them pay for their own meals at
[1:16:03.140 --> 1:16:08.820]  military bases in Germany when they've got their legs blown off. And I would get neocons
[1:16:08.820 --> 1:16:13.700]  calling up threatening my office and emailing me saying, you're a liar. See, that was under
[1:16:13.700 --> 1:16:18.140]  George Bush. So it was unpatriotic to say that the troops shouldn't have to pay for
[1:16:18.140 --> 1:16:22.180]  their own meals or pay for their own medical care. It's already going on. So why not just
[1:16:22.180 --> 1:16:34.580]  totally get rid of it? I mean, this is just a total raping. They don't care about you.
[1:16:34.580 --> 1:16:41.780]  Get that through your heads, folks. Ilya in New York, you're on the air. Go ahead.
[1:16:41.780 --> 1:16:51.180]  Hi, Alex. How are you? Good. Anyways, I've been trying to petition the government about
[1:16:51.180 --> 1:16:56.740]  parking tickets because all they say, I live in New York, all they say is that they need
[1:16:56.740 --> 1:17:03.420]  to receive a response within 30 days. And I didn't see any obligation that I had passed
[1:17:03.420 --> 1:17:09.340]  that. So these administrative law judges still believe that you owe them any money.
[1:17:09.340 --> 1:17:14.620]  They won't let you have a trial. They won't give you what the bill of rights says you're
[1:17:14.620 --> 1:17:19.300]  due. And then they still charge you the money. And it's come out in New York. They give people
[1:17:19.300 --> 1:17:23.580]  tickets even when they're parked correctly. And they've been ordered. The police put
[1:17:23.580 --> 1:17:27.500]  a full page ad and apologized and said, look, we've been ordered to squeeze you. This was
[1:17:27.500 --> 1:17:32.740]  three years ago. And we don't like doing this, but we've been ordered to really squeeze
[1:17:32.740 --> 1:17:40.100]  you. And absolutely go ahead. So I kept writing them letters saying, oh, please give me a
[1:17:40.100 --> 1:17:44.900]  jury trial or dismiss these tickets. But they don't really listen and they don't even
[1:17:44.900 --> 1:17:51.220]  send me any lawful contract that apparently that they might think that I signed with them,
[1:17:51.220 --> 1:17:55.220]  which is no contract. I didn't sign any contract with them. But if there was, I would like
[1:17:55.220 --> 1:18:00.980]  a copy of it or I would like a jury trial because it's in controversy of over $20.
[1:18:00.980 --> 1:18:06.460]  I saw administrative law charge yesterday. She said that it's not necessary for administrative
[1:18:06.460 --> 1:18:12.540]  proceedings to have a jury trial. Yeah, that's right. And then this sounds small, but once
[1:18:12.540 --> 1:18:16.860]  they do that, they can then without a trial, take anything else they want. And that's now
[1:18:16.860 --> 1:18:23.340]  happening in Austin. I appreciate your call, sir. Yeah, I was driving down the road last
[1:18:23.340 --> 1:18:28.540]  night and I heard the local news radio 590 covering this. So I got home and I Googled
[1:18:28.540 --> 1:18:32.900]  it and sure enough, I forgot to bring that. I told you, I left my stack at home. I forget
[1:18:32.900 --> 1:18:40.580]  the exact headline. It's schools taking Austin schools charging fine for cell phones. There's
[1:18:40.580 --> 1:18:45.820]  no judge, no jury, no sworn peace officer, nothing. If you have a cell phone, even if
[1:18:45.820 --> 1:18:51.860]  it's off, they take your cell phone and then make you pay $15 each time to get it back.
[1:18:51.860 --> 1:18:56.420]  And it's administrative. Just like there's no law. You got to take shots, but they say
[1:18:56.420 --> 1:19:00.140]  we're going to arrest you. If you don't take shots, then they do an administrative procedure.
[1:19:00.140 --> 1:19:05.060]  They expel you falsely. Then they trigger criminal proceedings for truancy when they
[1:19:05.060 --> 1:19:10.060]  falsely kicked you out to trigger the truancy. See how the little lawyer scam works. We try
[1:19:10.060 --> 1:19:15.100]  to explain that to some Prozac, Ritalin head, fluoride head person and they just can't understand
[1:19:15.100 --> 1:19:21.940]  it. Now it's the same thing here in Austin. And now I learned searching and all over the
[1:19:21.940 --> 1:19:29.020]  country, they're doing this in different locales. No judge, no jury, no nothing. I mean, it'd
[1:19:29.020 --> 1:19:33.660]  be one thing if they said, you're going to get sent to the principal's office in your
[1:19:33.660 --> 1:19:38.420]  disregarding policy and the third time you do it, you're going to get expelled. But no,
[1:19:38.420 --> 1:19:46.620]  they just want the money. And so they steal your cell phone and then raise money off of
[1:19:46.620 --> 1:19:49.420]  it. And then some kids don't have the money. So they just keep the cell phones and sell
[1:19:49.420 --> 1:19:57.500]  them. That was the other issue is that it's just totally criminal. And that's what tyranny
[1:19:57.500 --> 1:20:00.860]  is all about.

[1:22:15.540 --> 1:22:20.940]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew. Now, as they hail the birth of the New World
[1:22:20.940 --> 1:22:29.780]  Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand. For the first time
[1:22:29.780 --> 1:22:35.500]  in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open. You will learn the secret
[1:22:35.500 --> 1:22:38.300]  that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[1:22:38.300 --> 1:22:59.700]  The
[1:22:59.700 --> 1:23:04.900]  phone rings and the questions are asked. I've been so sick, will a life change tea help
[1:23:04.900 --> 1:23:11.220]  me? Our answer is always the same. Yes, toxins and chemicals from food, water and air are
[1:23:11.220 --> 1:23:17.340]  attacking you this very moment. Fight back with our all-natural, detoxifying tea that
[1:23:17.340 --> 1:23:23.780]  works immediately. Many companies use gimmicks and misleading free trials for their campaign.

[1:23:34.540 --> 1:23:40.300]  public has reached its all-time record for chronic sickness. This atrocity won't change

[1:23:57.940 --> 1:24:04.940]  shipping in the industry.
[1:24:27.940 --> 1:24:35.420]  Take an action, speak in the truth. You know, I say I get frustrated constantly. It's because
[1:24:35.420 --> 1:24:41.420]  I'm carrying around thousands of pieces of new data every week. That's how much I scan.
[1:24:41.420 --> 1:24:46.940]  Oh, I love that music. Just crank it up for a second. I have a little bit of enjoyment
[1:24:46.940 --> 1:25:01.940]  here.
[1:25:01.940 --> 1:25:28.940]  It's neat purple, baby. Oh, it's not the kill. It's the thrill of the day.
[1:25:28.940 --> 1:25:37.340]  All right, let me try to finish up with this and start getting your calls. The issue is
[1:25:37.340 --> 1:25:47.940]  that I get frustrated because there is so much news and then there's not time to really
[1:25:47.940 --> 1:25:52.780]  flesh out each story, each article, and properly put it in context so I just don't get to
[1:25:52.780 --> 1:25:57.180]  most of it. I mean, I've just got news here, stack after stack that's off the chart. It's
[1:25:57.180 --> 1:26:02.980]  all up on infoawards.com and prisonplanet.com. But the guy searched the story that I found
[1:26:02.980 --> 1:26:11.020]  yesterday and here it is. Cell phone fines mean big bucks for some Texas school districts.
[1:26:11.020 --> 1:26:14.940]  And it says in Austin, no judge, no jury, no due process. They just snatch and steal
[1:26:14.940 --> 1:26:27.140]  your property and they get $15 each time. And it says that Austin collected over $100,000
[1:26:27.140 --> 1:26:32.900]  in two years. Houston collected hundreds of thousands. One high school got 17,000 in
[1:26:32.900 --> 1:26:41.420]  one year alone. And it talks about how smaller ISDs are doing it. Montgomery ISD took in
[1:26:41.420 --> 1:26:54.340]  2,500. Magnolia ISDs doing it. I mean, this is millions. And the children are learning
[1:26:54.340 --> 1:26:59.700]  because they end up taking their cell phone to school. Some schools allow it. And if you
[1:26:59.700 --> 1:27:03.460]  have it out at lunch, then they take it because they want it. It's kind of like if the cops
[1:27:03.460 --> 1:27:07.980]  put too many speed traps up on the same road too long, they stop getting a catch. They
[1:27:07.980 --> 1:27:10.900]  move to other spots. They kind of want you speeding, you know, because they got to get
[1:27:10.900 --> 1:27:16.300]  the money. Well, at least there you can challenge it in court or you can, you know, demand due
[1:27:16.300 --> 1:27:25.740]  process. This is the end of America. I mean, you take the Texas Comptroller. No judge,
[1:27:25.740 --> 1:27:29.260]  no jury. She just says she thinks you didn't pay enough sales tax. They just grab it out
[1:27:29.260 --> 1:27:36.540]  of your account. No judge, no jury, no recourse. I mean, we live under tyranny, ladies and
[1:27:36.540 --> 1:27:45.340]  gentlemen. And all the time, executive branches of state and federal government and now international
[1:27:45.340 --> 1:27:50.100]  government, they'll just slap taxes without even a law being passed on cell phones or
[1:27:50.100 --> 1:27:55.900]  power or boats or cars. I mean, there's thousands of taxes now and you just don't notice because
[1:27:55.900 --> 1:28:00.140]  it's all in the contract when you buy something. A lot of them, they tag on to industries. Oh,
[1:28:00.140 --> 1:28:05.300]  a lot of states have a golfing tax or they have a lawn mower tax or they have a, and
[1:28:05.300 --> 1:28:10.780]  that's what this carbon tax is all about. It's just total control where they can selectively
[1:28:10.780 --> 1:28:16.220]  enforce 30 plus federal agencies can levy taxes by themselves. The law just gives them
[1:28:16.220 --> 1:28:20.100]  an imperial power, kind of like a letter of Mark where the Queen of England would tell
[1:28:20.100 --> 1:28:26.560]  a captain, all right, you can take your five ships out and you can rob this country ships,
[1:28:26.560 --> 1:28:31.060]  that country ships and this country ships. And I won't say you're a pirate. Sometimes
[1:28:31.060 --> 1:28:35.020]  the British and French governments, when they really needed money, they just say, Rob anybody
[1:28:35.020 --> 1:28:40.300]  you want, except for our flags, you can even rob our allies. There were some cases of
[1:28:40.300 --> 1:28:49.020]  that. So a pirate pulls up, robs everything you got and takes half the booty and gives
[1:28:49.020 --> 1:28:56.700]  it to the admiralty. Then the admiralty takes half for themselves and gives the rest of
[1:28:56.700 --> 1:29:04.220]  the crown. Oh yes, being an admiral had its fringe benefits. I mean, some admirals became
[1:29:04.220 --> 1:29:10.340]  lords and had millions of pounds. I mean, millions of pounds in pounds hundreds of
[1:29:10.340 --> 1:29:18.220]  years ago, meaning physical giant storehouses full of silver and gold robbed from the planet.
[1:29:18.220 --> 1:29:22.100]  These are pirates we're dealing with and you don't think they won't stage a terror attack
[1:29:22.100 --> 1:29:27.740]  and kill 3000 people to get their whole agenda through. You are thinking like a fool if you
[1:29:27.740 --> 1:29:32.540]  don't know history. All right, I'm going to continue with your phone calls. You know,
[1:29:32.540 --> 1:29:35.460]  the side that I'm going to go through this key analysis breakdown, the whole host of
[1:29:35.460 --> 1:29:40.060]  issues about my philosophy and where I see the world going on the other side. I'm wound
[1:29:40.060 --> 1:29:44.180]  up and focused today, ladies and gentlemen, and I'm honored to be your host. I'm honored
[1:29:44.180 --> 1:29:51.140]  to be here with you right here on the GCN radio network, present on TV. Check it out today.
[1:29:51.140 --> 1:30:00.620]  We're on the March, the empires on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN radio network. Hello
[1:30:00.620 --> 1:30:04.900]  friends. This is Alex Jones and I want each of you to ask yourself this question. Do you
[1:30:04.900 --> 1:30:09.740]  really know what's in your tap water? In a recent study conducted by a major environmental
[1:30:09.740 --> 1:30:14.900]  auditor, they found that over 260 chemicals in pollutants are present in municipal drinking
[1:30:14.900 --> 1:30:18.980]  water. Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive, immune and
[1:30:18.980 --> 1:30:24.140]  developmental system diseases. Now, what are you going to do about it? The Acola blue atmospheric
[1:30:24.140 --> 1:30:28.580]  water generator is a low cost way to take back control of you and your family's drinking
[1:30:28.580 --> 1:30:33.940]  water. The Acola blue 28 produces up to seven gallons of water from the humidity in the atmosphere
[1:30:33.940 --> 1:30:39.340]  and uses state of the art carbon filtration, reverse osmosis and ultra violent light sterilization
[1:30:39.340 --> 1:30:45.020]  techniques. That's right. Clean water right from the air you breathe. Order today by calling

[1:31:34.060 --> 1:31:38.860]  cafe. They're great organic coffee infused with polysaccharides that boosts the immune
[1:31:38.860 --> 1:31:43.500]  system. A truly healthy coffee that tastes great. And take it from me folks, it really

[1:32:00.660 --> 1:32:05.060]  This is Alex Jones with 5 Good Reasons You Should Consider Buying a Solar Power Generator
[1:32:05.060 --> 1:32:09.300]  this summer. Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric
[1:32:09.300 --> 1:32:14.500]  bill. Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company
[1:32:14.500 --> 1:32:19.220]  allows you to have. It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart
[1:32:19.220 --> 1:32:23.620]  grid technology is coming. Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid
[1:32:23.620 --> 1:32:27.460]  is dangerously overloaded, especially with the high demand summer months ahead. Number
[1:32:27.460 --> 1:32:31.700]  four, the hurricane and dangerous summer storm season is here again. Every year, thousands
[1:32:31.700 --> 1:32:36.580]  of families lose their power from weather-related outages. Number five, a solar power generator
[1:32:36.580 --> 1:32:40.820]  provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind. Folks, I really believe in the solar
[1:32:40.820 --> 1:32:45.180]  power generators offered by Solutions from Science, a longtime sponsor of ours. You can

[1:33:04.220 --> 1:33:23.900]  All right, let's go to your phone calls here. Jerry in Indiana, you're on the air. Thanks
[1:33:23.900 --> 1:33:27.300]  for holding. Hi, Alex.
[1:33:27.300 --> 1:33:28.300]  Hey, Jerry.
[1:33:28.300 --> 1:33:36.220]  Hey, I appreciate your videos. These are excellent, professionally done. I am a loner, hermit-type
[1:33:36.220 --> 1:33:43.980]  person, but I bought these videos and got them out to my circle of people. And I have
[1:33:43.980 --> 1:33:49.980]  a waiting list to see them now. And the thing is for these listeners, I've been a short-wave
[1:33:49.980 --> 1:33:58.580]  listener for 35 years now. And the thing of it is, the people that are receptive to these
[1:33:58.580 --> 1:34:06.420]  videos get them out, the ones that are not. Go on. It's a numbers game. We got to stand
[1:34:06.420 --> 1:34:15.620]  for liberty. And I appreciate you clinging to Psalms 9416, Alex. It makes me proud to
[1:34:15.620 --> 1:34:24.900]  talk to you. The other thing, I had a woman came over in my little circle and said, well,
[1:34:24.900 --> 1:34:29.100]  I don't believe about eugenics. You don't believe, she said, I don't believe in eugenics.
[1:34:29.100 --> 1:34:35.620]  So I backed it up to the Georgia Guidestones. People, the information that Alex Jones has
[1:34:35.620 --> 1:34:46.300]  on these videos is damning to the New World Order. Jim Guy Tucker, I listened to 30 years
[1:34:46.300 --> 1:34:53.940]  ago when he was just going out after Bilderberg, Webster, Tarpley. These are credible individuals
[1:34:53.940 --> 1:35:00.660]  that are in these videos. Like I said, I'm not a speaker. Alex Jones didn't call me
[1:35:00.660 --> 1:35:08.180]  and tell me to promote his show. I'm doing it because he stands for liberty. We must
[1:35:08.180 --> 1:35:17.140]  take this country back. I would, you know, I would rather die on my feet than be a slave
[1:35:17.140 --> 1:35:24.340]  on my knees. You've got to burn what it did for me watching these videos of the stinking
[1:35:24.340 --> 1:35:31.980]  of our forefathers, Alex, what they went through to save this republic.
[1:35:31.980 --> 1:35:35.660]  And you know, the establishment loves to attack the founding fathers. I was watching key government
[1:35:35.660 --> 1:35:40.060]  last time he had a guest doing it. Think of the time they were in. They were the most
[1:35:40.060 --> 1:35:44.140]  truly progressive, the most truly liberal in the spirit of freedom, your real liberalness,
[1:35:44.140 --> 1:35:50.660]  not the establishment counterfeit of today. They were amazing intellectuals on par, even
[1:35:50.660 --> 1:35:55.980]  greater minds than the best Greek philosophers, the greatest Greek philosophers. And this
[1:35:55.980 --> 1:36:00.860]  country for all the bad it's done has been the most special, has been the greatest engine.
[1:36:00.860 --> 1:36:05.820]  I mean, 4% of the world's population, we had half the wealth. Then all the controllers
[1:36:05.820 --> 1:36:11.380]  and all the manipulators and all the charlatans came here to eat us out of house and home.
[1:36:11.380 --> 1:36:16.620]  They came here to carpet bag and to scallywag and they've done a great job of it. We just
[1:36:16.620 --> 1:36:20.580]  got to get rid of these criminals. And we got to get our spirit back. It's like when you've
[1:36:20.580 --> 1:36:25.540]  got a bad employee who's gotten out of control and somehow they've got you bamboozled and
[1:36:25.540 --> 1:36:29.060]  you've been intimidated for no reason to not stand up. As soon as you finally stand
[1:36:29.060 --> 1:36:33.780]  up, it feels great. And the government is our employee and it knows we're waking up.
[1:36:33.780 --> 1:36:37.580]  So he's trying to set up a police state right now. And we've got to point out to the police
[1:36:37.580 --> 1:36:41.620]  state enforcers. Hey, you're getting enslaved too, Baba. And they're starting to listen.
[1:36:41.620 --> 1:36:45.580]  So God bless you. And I really appreciate your call from Indiana. Thanks for holding
[1:36:45.580 --> 1:36:52.460]  to say that. You know, the word clinging is true. And every once in a while, the fear
[1:36:52.460 --> 1:36:56.820]  creeps in every once in a while, not even fear. It's like, God, I love looking at the
[1:36:56.820 --> 1:37:02.420]  blue sky. I love looking at my son and daughters. I love swimming with them. I love hiking.
[1:37:02.420 --> 1:37:08.940]  I love the smell of cut grass. It was a sprinkler on yesterday. I was out in the backyard playing
[1:37:08.940 --> 1:37:12.460]  with my children for about two hours, two hours. I spent with them. I tried to a lot
[1:37:12.460 --> 1:37:17.060]  that time. I wish I could spend more. And the sprinkler, my son was watering plants and
[1:37:17.060 --> 1:37:20.500]  he dropped it, you know, kind of the hand sprayer. And it was like a sprinkler because
[1:37:20.500 --> 1:37:25.260]  it fell to the ground. I always tend to simplify stories and I go back and want to break it
[1:37:25.260 --> 1:37:31.740]  down. We're in the backyard and he's got the sprayer on the end of the hose and he's spraying
[1:37:31.740 --> 1:37:34.780]  some plants. It's not really watering him, but you know, kids like to water. He's having
[1:37:34.780 --> 1:37:42.820]  fun and he drops it and runs off chasing the dog, throwing a ball. And so it was shooting
[1:37:42.820 --> 1:37:49.220]  up into an oak tree and shooting out into the sun, making a rainbow and the smell of
[1:37:49.220 --> 1:37:54.740]  the water and the ozone coming out of it. It was like heaven. And I just said, this
[1:37:54.740 --> 1:38:00.780]  is heaven. It is so simple. And then I think, man, I don't want them to kill me. I don't
[1:38:00.780 --> 1:38:05.820]  want to not be here for my kids. I don't want them to or get put in prison or set up or
[1:38:05.820 --> 1:38:09.900]  lied about. And I just said, and you know, it's just God, you just take it, you just
[1:38:09.900 --> 1:38:16.860]  handle it. But also when I pray, I say, God, don't protect me. If that means it doesn't
[1:38:16.860 --> 1:38:25.620]  get my job done. You know, just whatever it takes, I'm here. I'm ready and just protect
[1:38:25.620 --> 1:38:31.420]  my family. But if that's not in the plan, then don't. I'm not here telling God what
[1:38:31.420 --> 1:38:37.580]  to do. I'm saying, give me Providence, give me leadership, give me guidance and direction.
[1:38:37.580 --> 1:38:42.060]  Help me be strong. And at the time I get the spirit of frustration and not doing a good
[1:38:42.060 --> 1:38:46.140]  job. And I need to realize that now I'm doing the best I can. And then when I'm just calm
[1:38:46.140 --> 1:38:50.660]  and turned over to God, I'm so much more articulate, so much more focused. And that's the path
[1:38:50.660 --> 1:38:57.140]  to be on. Trust in God, but tie up your camel is the better one say or trust in God, but
[1:38:57.140 --> 1:39:01.780]  row away from the rocks. Take action, get involved and do the best you can. And then
[1:39:01.780 --> 1:39:11.380]  just say, I'm doing the best I can creator. Will you carry me the rest of the way? And
[1:39:11.380 --> 1:39:15.340]  that's what faith is, is that I'm going to do the best I can. I'm going to try to be
[1:39:15.340 --> 1:39:18.500]  the best person I can. I'm going to try to be a moral good person. I'm going to try
[1:39:18.500 --> 1:39:22.580]  to be humble. I'm going to try to not be too competitive with people or too worldly
[1:39:22.580 --> 1:39:27.220]  or too hateful. I mean, folks, I can just instantly froth into evil. I can just shift
[1:39:27.220 --> 1:39:34.300]  into it. But the more I deny the flesh, the more I lay it down and just try to be a good
[1:39:34.300 --> 1:39:39.540]  person and really try to be strong. It's just so humbling at the same time. And in the humbling,
[1:39:39.540 --> 1:39:44.060]  it makes you so strong. And then you see people that are into the flesh, into the world and
[1:39:44.060 --> 1:39:49.180]  you feel sorry for them, even your enemies. I kind of shifted into looking at Bill Gates
[1:39:49.180 --> 1:39:53.340]  enjoying all his evil and all the eugenics and I, I hate him, but at a certain level,
[1:39:53.340 --> 1:39:58.020]  I just look at how pathetic he is. And then I think, how can we be ruled by this guy?
[1:39:58.020 --> 1:40:03.500]  How can he be winning? It's only because good people have it stood up. If you lay down
[1:40:03.500 --> 1:40:09.860]  in a fight, you're going to lose folks. You know, the only times I got my butt kicked
[1:40:09.860 --> 1:40:15.060]  in fights were the few times that I was a little bit in the wrong. Anytime I was a
[1:40:15.060 --> 1:40:18.900]  little bit in the wrong, anytime I went ahead and let myself get in the fight fast, anytime
[1:40:18.900 --> 1:40:22.860]  I went ahead and said, sure, you want some, those are the fewer times, but every time
[1:40:22.860 --> 1:40:28.100]  I was in the right and every time that I was outnumbered, it was, it just, it just couldn't
[1:40:28.100 --> 1:40:35.660]  be stopped. And that's what it is in every facet of life, ladies and gentlemen. And the
[1:40:35.660 --> 1:40:40.380]  times I was in the wrong, some little guy could kick my butt. But when I was in the
[1:40:40.380 --> 1:40:43.340]  right, I could sit there with four or five big, huge football players, 250 pounds and
[1:40:43.340 --> 1:40:47.900]  just punch him each time. And they just lay right over, you know, just with bones cracking.
[1:40:47.900 --> 1:40:53.180]  The only problem was my fist would break and bones would crack. And again, that's not tough
[1:40:53.180 --> 1:40:59.220]  guy talk. I'm seeing you all know that you've all experienced things like that. What's that
[1:40:59.220 --> 1:41:03.700]  Texas Ranger founders quote, print that off. I forget the exact quote. It's great having
[1:41:03.700 --> 1:41:08.140]  the team in there because they just run the TV show. Mainly Genesis runs the radio side
[1:41:08.140 --> 1:41:11.940]  so they can kind of sit there for it alive at TV and print me all this stuff about a
[1:41:11.940 --> 1:41:17.940]  man in the wrong can't keep on a coming against a man who's in the right or a man in the wrong
[1:41:17.940 --> 1:41:26.220]  can't stand up against a man in the right keeps on a coming. But when you are in the
[1:41:26.220 --> 1:41:30.540]  wrong folks, you're weak. Well, you may win a few victories. You may be able to snipe
[1:41:30.540 --> 1:41:35.260]  it. People engage in evil, but you're not going to be fulfilled. You got feet made of
[1:41:35.260 --> 1:41:44.300]  clay folks. I want feet made of carbide steel. Yeah, this is the King James Bible Psalms
[1:41:44.300 --> 1:41:49.980]  23 and I do cling to it because this is real folks. What I do is real. Our trials and tribulations
[1:41:49.980 --> 1:41:54.300]  are real, but it's all a blessing. The Lord is my shepherd. I shall not want. He make
[1:41:54.300 --> 1:41:58.900]  us me a lie down in green pastures. He lead us me besides still waters. He restore with
[1:41:58.900 --> 1:42:06.300]  my soul. He lead us me in the path of righteousness for his name's sake. Yeah, though I walk to
[1:42:06.300 --> 1:42:12.860]  the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil for thou art with me. Thy rod
[1:42:12.860 --> 1:42:18.060]  and thy staff, they comfort me. This is the most important part. Thou preparest a table
[1:42:18.060 --> 1:42:24.220]  before me in the presence of my enemies. Thou anointest my head with the oil, my copper
[1:42:24.220 --> 1:42:30.620]  on the cover. Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life and I will
[1:42:30.620 --> 1:42:34.380]  dwell in the house of the Lord forever. I think that's probably the most beautiful part
[1:42:34.380 --> 1:42:40.740]  of the Bible. And that's why the enemy doesn't want you to read things like this. Even if
[1:42:40.740 --> 1:42:45.620]  you're not a Christian, that is beautiful, beautiful ideas. It says so much in such a
[1:42:45.620 --> 1:42:52.540]  short period of time. It buoys the soul. The Lord is my shepherd. I shall not want. He
[1:42:52.540 --> 1:42:57.620]  maketh me to lie down in green pastures exactly like I was laying down in a green pasture.
[1:42:57.620 --> 1:43:05.500]  I just would lay there on the grass plan with my little 16 month old girl and the sun shining
[1:43:05.500 --> 1:43:11.260]  in the trees and the birds. He maketh me to lie down in green pastures with all this evil
[1:43:11.260 --> 1:43:17.140]  going on around us. Ladies and gentlemen, he maketh us to lie down in green pastures.
[1:43:17.140 --> 1:43:22.460]  He leadeth me by beside still waters, still waters, ever walked beside a still waters.
[1:43:22.460 --> 1:43:27.820]  How it energizes the soul because it reflects God's love in the universe through the holy
[1:43:27.820 --> 1:43:33.380]  water. He restoreth my soul. He leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his name
[1:43:33.380 --> 1:43:38.860]  sake. He restoreth. See, whenever you're torn down, he builds you back up stronger each
[1:43:38.860 --> 1:43:44.220]  time you go to the flame. He restoreth my soul. He leadeth me in the paths of righteousness
[1:43:44.220 --> 1:43:49.460]  for his name sake. Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, we are
[1:43:49.460 --> 1:43:53.940]  all in the shadow of death. We will all die. We will all take that final journey. I will
[1:43:53.940 --> 1:44:00.460]  fear no evil. He must conquer the fear through God, through creation, through love. I will
[1:44:00.460 --> 1:44:05.860]  fear no evil for thou art with me. Creation is with you. The creator, the great maker
[1:44:05.860 --> 1:44:13.860]  is with you. Thou preparest the table before me in the presence of my enemies.
[1:44:13.860 --> 1:44:21.620]  See, that's another variation of no weapon formed against us shall prosper. Thou preparest
[1:44:21.620 --> 1:44:25.820]  the table before me in the presence of my enemies. Thou anointest my head with oil.
[1:44:25.820 --> 1:44:35.260]  My cup runneth over. See, you're anointed with discernment and understanding. With great
[1:44:35.260 --> 1:44:40.740]  knowledge comes great pain, but also great love.
[1:44:40.740 --> 1:44:47.580]  Thou anointest my head with oil. My cup runneth over. The cup runneth over. I'm so blessed
[1:44:47.580 --> 1:44:54.500]  in every way. Blessed with health and blessed with beauty and blessed with friends and blessed
[1:44:54.500 --> 1:45:03.060]  with family. Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life. And I will
[1:45:03.060 --> 1:45:06.980]  dwell in the house of the Lord forever. And I'm just so blessed to have, in comparison
[1:45:06.980 --> 1:45:13.620]  to many, such a good, wholesome, strong family. And of course, liberty and freedom and love
[1:45:13.620 --> 1:45:17.540]  of God does run in families. It runs in all of you out there to different degrees and
[1:45:17.540 --> 1:45:23.820]  different gifts. And you have to realize that you will fail. You will fall. You will die.
[1:45:23.820 --> 1:45:31.620]  This body suit, this earth suit is meant to decay. And in accepting that and loving that
[1:45:31.620 --> 1:45:42.740]  and enjoying that and enjoying the new life, you reach fulfillment. That's why when I
[1:45:42.740 --> 1:45:47.620]  was young, I never thought old people were ugly. And so many other people thought old
[1:45:47.620 --> 1:45:52.980]  people were ugly. Ooh, look at that old lady. Look at that old man. I, if they still had
[1:45:52.980 --> 1:45:57.860]  their soul, they hadn't been destroyed by the world, there's great beauty in our elders.
[1:45:57.860 --> 1:46:03.780]  Just as there's beauty in a child or beauty in a young woman or young man, the beauty
[1:46:03.780 --> 1:46:13.900]  of life. There's beauty in swallows or bluebirds that nest in my yard. This is, there's beauty
[1:46:13.900 --> 1:46:21.900]  in a grizzly bear or the salmon that scoops out of the river. There's beauty in all things.
[1:46:21.900 --> 1:46:26.380]  As long as it's part of God's creation and God's order, and there is a time to live and
[1:46:26.380 --> 1:46:33.020]  a time to die. I know all these things are common sense, but do we think about them?
[1:46:33.020 --> 1:46:38.380]  Do we understand them? Do we, do we understand that we're part of an endless chain and that
[1:46:38.380 --> 1:46:47.260]  our ancestors live through us right now and that our progeny and their progeny to come
[1:46:47.260 --> 1:46:57.940]  that we live through them? All the blood of heroes and tyrants and good men, bad men,
[1:46:57.940 --> 1:47:05.660]  artists, musicians, blacksmith, warriors, it all flows through your veins. No matter
[1:47:05.660 --> 1:47:10.860]  where you come from, what culture, what race of the human race, what variety, it's all
[1:47:10.860 --> 1:47:17.380]  there, that whole history. And all any of us really want to do is leave our mark in
[1:47:17.380 --> 1:47:25.200]  society and leave the world better than we found it when we came into it. We want to
[1:47:25.200 --> 1:47:31.220]  communicate with the future. We want to communicate with generations to come. Not just because
[1:47:31.220 --> 1:47:36.940]  we don't want to be forgotten, but because we love them. We love life. So in our literature,
[1:47:36.940 --> 1:47:44.900]  in our writings, in our music, in our films, in all we do, we send a message into the future.
[1:47:44.900 --> 1:47:49.460]  And all the evil of the past echoes with us today as well. But if you want to beat the
[1:47:49.460 --> 1:47:52.740]  New World Order, start loving yourself, start loving your neighbor, start loving your wife,
[1:47:52.740 --> 1:47:59.380]  your husband, start loving the people around you, forgive those that trespass against you,
[1:47:59.380 --> 1:48:09.820]  this is we have trespassed against them. But there are the psychopaths completely given
[1:48:09.820 --> 1:48:20.660]  over to the dark side, completely consumed by evil. It runs in their families and most
[1:48:20.660 --> 1:48:31.460]  of them fall. And they are mortal enemies until the end. Let's talk to Mike in Wyoming.
[1:48:31.460 --> 1:48:33.140]  Mike are on the air.
[1:48:33.140 --> 1:48:37.780]  Alex, I had an idea the other day as I was listening to one of your horror stories about
[1:48:37.780 --> 1:48:44.860]  people who who've been electrocuted or killed for just the most minor infractions or for
[1:48:44.860 --> 1:48:52.020]  nothing at all by city cops or sheriff's deputies. And I wish I had the time and expertise to
[1:48:52.020 --> 1:48:59.060]  do it myself. But if someone could just set up a website and call it something like dangerouscities.com
[1:48:59.060 --> 1:49:06.940]  that just listed these towns and cities where these horror stories took place and just a
[1:49:06.940 --> 1:49:16.700]  brief snippet about what exactly occurred there. And then notice the mayor and the chamber
[1:49:16.700 --> 1:49:22.340]  of commerce and said, congratulations, you've made it to our list of most dangerous cities
[1:49:22.340 --> 1:49:23.340]  in the U.S.
[1:49:23.340 --> 1:49:27.580]  It's a genius idea and you've been calling for 10 years, you're a medical doctor. It'd
[1:49:27.580 --> 1:49:30.180]  be great to have a medical doctor do a site like that.
[1:49:30.180 --> 1:49:35.700]  Yeah, like I said, I used to be a computer programmer too, but those days are long gone
[1:49:35.700 --> 1:49:44.140]  and I'd be happy to contribute to the uptake or upkeep of such a site, but I don't have
[1:49:44.140 --> 1:49:51.900]  the ability to set it up myself. But if one of your listeners might run with it.
[1:49:51.900 --> 1:49:58.460]  Oh, absolutely. We've given an email out before for a free DVD and had like 300 emails in
[1:49:58.460 --> 1:50:02.820]  five seconds wanting it, 300 plus. So I'm sure people have already gone out and tried
[1:50:02.820 --> 1:50:09.620]  to get dangerous cities, but we just got something else. What do we just get? You guys are doing
[1:50:09.620 --> 1:50:14.260]  high fives in there. Okay. They thought of another great name. Absolutely. Mike, what
[1:50:14.260 --> 1:50:17.500]  do you think about the whole state of the world? I mean, we've been expecting all of
[1:50:17.500 --> 1:50:20.500]  this, but it's really hard for me to even believe it's happening.
[1:50:20.500 --> 1:50:29.660]  Yeah, it is. And most people in my little corner of the world here are still in denial.
[1:50:29.660 --> 1:50:33.940]  You know, there's a, there's a gradual awakening occurring, I think. And, you know, I write
[1:50:33.940 --> 1:50:40.900]  op-eds every six weeks as often as I'm permitted to by the local paper and they give me a lot
[1:50:40.900 --> 1:50:45.980]  of latitude. You know, my last piece was 700 words. Hey, Mike, you ought to write those
[1:50:45.980 --> 1:50:51.100]  for us and also publish them there. Writersandinfowords.com. Stay there, Mike. Once you finish up, I'm
[1:50:51.100 --> 1:50:56.260]  going to sign and we'll go to Jason, Kay, Ronnie and others. And then Wayne Paul, brother
[1:50:56.260 --> 1:51:02.660]  of Connors and Ron Paul, wait to hear this guy. This is Alex Jones and I want to tell

[1:52:01.580 --> 1:52:07.700]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear. We've
[1:52:07.700 --> 1:52:12.420]  got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would
[1:52:12.420 --> 1:52:17.900]  like to see. The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for
[1:52:17.900 --> 1:52:26.740]  the best interest of the American people. If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass
[1:52:26.740 --> 1:52:32.980]  movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers
[1:52:32.980 --> 1:52:39.820]  and finance oligarchs, that's fascism. It's not about left to right. It's about a one
[1:52:39.820 --> 1:52:46.180]  world government. This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and
[1:52:46.180 --> 1:52:53.100]  his real agenda. Get your copy of the Obama deception today at infowars.com or download
[1:52:53.100 --> 1:53:01.780]  it in super high quality at prisonplanet.tv. The Obama deception. The people strike back.
[1:53:01.780 --> 1:53:05.500]  Millions of Americans are beginning to realize the enormity of the economic and political
[1:53:05.500 --> 1:53:09.620]  problems facing the U.S. and the world, and for the first time in their lives, they are
[1:53:09.620 --> 1:53:15.020]  feeling the need for preparedness. Ready Reserve Foods has been in continuous operation, manufacturing

[1:54:23.540 --> 1:54:51.340]  How much all this one human life worth? Many of us, including your dad, I think were schooled
[1:54:51.340 --> 1:54:57.660]  by the Verge Society, and one of the ideas that they've always pushed is taking back
[1:54:57.660 --> 1:55:08.100]  Congress by means of the House, the lower House of the Congress. I ran for Congress
[1:55:08.100 --> 1:55:11.900]  last year. I was only in this little town for a little more than a year, so I didn't
[1:55:11.900 --> 1:55:17.420]  have any illusions about winning, but it was an education for me, and I realized why
[1:55:17.420 --> 1:55:26.580]  the system is broken. Almost all the debates were set up by local chambers of commerce,
[1:55:26.580 --> 1:55:32.960]  or mining groups, or farming or ranching groups, who all had their own agenda and a pretty
[1:55:32.960 --> 1:55:40.460]  well circumscribed set of questions that they wanted to address. If all you need to do,
[1:55:40.460 --> 1:55:44.540]  if you want to run for office, and if you don't mind being center stage, maybe through
[1:55:44.540 --> 1:55:50.020]  your church, or through contacts throughout your congressional district, call people,
[1:55:50.020 --> 1:55:56.580]  tell them to set up their own debate. They might have to create some kind of phony front
[1:55:56.580 --> 1:56:04.300]  organization to sound legit, the concerned Christians of America, or whatever, but send
[1:56:04.300 --> 1:56:10.460]  out invitations and do them on the weekend when people can actually attend. The problem
[1:56:10.460 --> 1:56:15.860]  was most of these organizations and chambers will do them during the week, and they were
[1:56:15.860 --> 1:56:23.100]  very poorly attended, so it was very frustrating. The questions really didn't bear on the important
[1:56:23.100 --> 1:56:30.500]  economic issues of the day. They've limited your time to a great extent. If people set
[1:56:30.500 --> 1:56:38.860]  up their own debates with a much better framework, allowing several minutes to say what you want
[1:56:38.860 --> 1:56:44.420]  to say, and more meaningful questions, we could take back district by district, this
[1:56:44.420 --> 1:56:45.420]  country.
[1:56:45.420 --> 1:56:50.340]  Exactly. The establishment sets the agenda with pop and diversions, and Michael Jackson
[1:56:50.340 --> 1:56:53.780]  for the general public. The people that are even politically involved, it's all special
[1:56:53.780 --> 1:56:58.900]  interest. I looked at running for office once, and it was all these groups sending me questionnaires.
[1:56:58.900 --> 1:57:02.500]  They all only care about their own special interest. We have to get the American people
[1:57:02.500 --> 1:57:07.060]  back involved caring about the Bill of Rights and Constitution that was designed to protect
[1:57:07.060 --> 1:57:12.140]  us from all these special interests. The founding fathers were literal geniuses, but people
[1:57:12.140 --> 1:57:17.940]  keep saying the Constitution's failed. No, we failed to enforce it, and just running
[1:57:17.940 --> 1:57:22.860]  for mayor or city council or county commissioner or water district or Congress means you get
[1:57:22.860 --> 1:57:29.580]  to go speak at these events and inject real issues. So, resistance is victory might go
[1:57:29.580 --> 1:57:30.580]  to hear from you.
[1:57:30.580 --> 1:57:34.620]  I'm going to come back, take a few more calls, and at eight after, we're going to get Wayne
[1:57:34.620 --> 1:57:41.140]  Paul on for the balance of the hour and the second segment of the next hour. I've already
[1:57:41.140 --> 1:57:46.700]  done two hours now here, just shy of two hours. I want to encourage everybody to visit infowars.com

[2:00:19.380 --> 2:00:20.380]  Texas, Alex Jones.
[2:00:20.380 --> 2:00:29.660]  We're going live at PrismPlanet.tv in about seven and a half minutes with Wayne Paul,
[2:00:29.660 --> 2:00:33.780]  brother of Dr. Ron Paul. We're going to play a clip of him from the Obama deception live

[2:00:47.100 --> 2:00:52.020]  Wayne Paul is coming up. So stay with us. Right now, let's keep going to your calls.
[2:00:52.020 --> 2:00:57.580]  Let's talk to Jason in Colorado, then Kay, Ronnie, Phillip, Ronnie and others. Go ahead.
[2:00:57.580 --> 2:01:00.580]  You're on the air, Jason.
[2:01:00.580 --> 2:01:06.380]  Hey, Alex. This is Jason calling from the beautifully fed and festive state of Colorado.
[2:01:06.380 --> 2:01:13.020]  I just wanted to see if you actually had a chance to look at the WHO update for July
[2:01:13.020 --> 2:01:19.300]  16th regarding the swine flu. Yeah, they say we're level six and they're getting ready
[2:01:19.300 --> 2:01:24.180]  for global forced inoculation of three shots. And here in Austin, they have the public already
[2:01:24.180 --> 2:01:28.300]  admitting on the newscast says it isn't even the right flu, but the public doesn't care.
[2:01:28.300 --> 2:01:32.460]  And the kids are all lining up to get the special shot the government wants you to have.
[2:01:32.460 --> 2:01:36.180]  And of course it'll come out later that they're all going to be sterile or have brain tumors.
[2:01:36.180 --> 2:01:40.140]  But you know, folks don't know the government's killers. You really can't blame them being
[2:01:40.140 --> 2:01:43.380]  gullible. It's like, it's like your dog that trusts you. If you were to take it out in
[2:01:43.380 --> 2:01:47.420]  the backyard, it would trust you as you put a 45 to its head and blow its head off. They're
[2:01:47.420 --> 2:01:49.420]  just as trusting as a Labrador Retriever.
[2:01:49.420 --> 2:01:50.420]  Yep.
[2:01:50.420 --> 2:01:54.420]  Let me expand on that just for a second now. It's what I'm referring to is that the World
[2:01:54.420 --> 2:01:58.580]  Health Organization had been coming out with daily updates every two to three days with
[2:01:58.580 --> 2:02:02.380]  the number of confirmed cases and the number of deaths in these countries. Today they came
[2:02:02.380 --> 2:02:08.020]  out with a report that says that they are no longer requiring countries to submit regular
[2:02:08.020 --> 2:02:12.540]  reports of individual laboratory confirmed cases and deaths to the World Health Organization.
[2:02:12.540 --> 2:02:16.660]  Well, I mean, what is it? There's several different tracking system. What is it? It's
[2:02:16.660 --> 2:02:22.220]  like 170 something I checked last week on the World Health Organization. What are they
[2:02:22.220 --> 2:02:24.220]  saying it is right now?
[2:02:24.220 --> 2:02:30.740]  It was on July 6th. It was at right around 97,000. And I jumped 30% from the previous
[2:02:30.740 --> 2:02:31.740]  week.
[2:02:31.740 --> 2:02:32.740]  No, I'm talking about deaths.
[2:02:32.740 --> 2:02:35.860]  No, they are not reporting it. They have not updated it since July 6th. That's what
[2:02:35.860 --> 2:02:36.860]  I'm telling you.
[2:02:36.860 --> 2:02:40.740]  I'm telling you, I'm saying, what is the number? You're not listening. I don't have it in
[2:02:40.740 --> 2:02:44.940]  front of me. What I'm asking you is, what is the last number they're giving for deaths?
[2:02:44.940 --> 2:02:47.420]  I'd have to go into look at the...
[2:02:47.420 --> 2:02:53.300]  I think it's 170 something. I checked it last week. But yes, because it's all hype. It's
[2:02:53.300 --> 2:02:57.500]  all a lie. It's all much to do about nothing. And the last two swine flu outbreaks broke
[2:02:57.500 --> 2:03:04.460]  out at U.S. military bases. And this thing is... This is a giant scythe. And they're
[2:03:04.460 --> 2:03:09.700]  saying millions have it in the U.S. But yeah, you're carrying a no big deal virus. There's
[2:03:09.700 --> 2:03:12.100]  thousands of flu viruses out there.
[2:03:12.100 --> 2:03:14.940]  And so what do you think is going on with this? What do you think the bigger story is?
[2:03:14.940 --> 2:03:18.980]  Well, I think the bigger story is that the World Health Organization is actually leading
[2:03:18.980 --> 2:03:24.540]  the charge on informing the public, not only in America, but across the globe, and then
[2:03:24.540 --> 2:03:28.140]  now saying that they're no longer going to be requiring countries to report confirmed
[2:03:28.140 --> 2:03:29.140]  cases nor deaths.
[2:03:29.140 --> 2:03:33.980]  It sounds to me like they're going to stop actually just tracking it on the larger level
[2:03:33.980 --> 2:03:40.820]  so that we can stay uninformed. Again, if it's, you know, does mutate or spread or death
[2:03:40.820 --> 2:03:45.900]  start to increase in South America, which they are suspecting, or other countries, how
[2:03:45.900 --> 2:03:51.060]  are we ever going to be able to track that information if they are not reporting it?
[2:03:51.060 --> 2:03:55.340]  No, I hear you all up. You know what? Ride a blurb and send it to ridersandinfowars.com.
[2:03:55.340 --> 2:03:58.740]  Thank you so much, Jason. Yeah, I mean, I've been meaning to spend more time on this whole
[2:03:58.740 --> 2:03:59.740]  flu situation.
[2:03:59.740 --> 2:04:04.180]  As I said back when it first broke out, that they were already really at level five. They
[2:04:04.180 --> 2:04:09.300]  were going to go to level six within 96 hours. I believe the memo said you can pull it up.
[2:04:09.300 --> 2:04:12.940]  It's on infowars.com. And then it came out that we were telling you the truth and it
[2:04:12.940 --> 2:04:17.460]  was a real document. I got it from his official, I'll just say that, public servant here in
[2:04:17.460 --> 2:04:21.340]  Austin. And then months later, yeah, they said, oh, yeah, we've really been at level
[2:04:21.340 --> 2:04:26.220]  six. So that's going on. I said, either this is a giant hoax or they could be doing the
[2:04:26.220 --> 2:04:30.700]  big one right now because they've been gearing up for mass culling, mass death. This is one
[2:04:30.700 --> 2:04:36.020]  of their models. And now they're saying, oh, yeah, it's going to get real bad and could
[2:04:36.020 --> 2:04:42.460]  kill millions in the fall when it's no big deal. Do they know it's going to mutate? To
[2:04:42.460 --> 2:04:47.180]  something deadly? Usually mutates to something that's less harmful. Are they going to release
[2:04:47.180 --> 2:04:51.620]  something else that's similar? Is this their perfect cover for the collapsing economy in
[2:04:51.620 --> 2:04:56.260]  the fall and the global dictatorship being set up by the new bank of the world? They've
[2:04:56.260 --> 2:05:01.740]  certainly got it in their fist of cards. They certainly could play that card. Hello, friends.
[2:05:01.740 --> 2:05:05.660]  This is Alex Jones. I've told you for a long time, it's important to be self sufficient

[2:07:00.860 --> 2:07:04.780]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones and I want each of you to ask yourself this question.
[2:07:04.780 --> 2:07:10.020]  Do you really know what's in your tap water? In a recent study conducted by a major environmental
[2:07:10.020 --> 2:07:15.180]  auditor, they found that over 260 chemicals in pollutants are present in municipal drinking
[2:07:15.180 --> 2:07:19.260]  water. Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive, immune and
[2:07:19.260 --> 2:07:24.420]  developmental system diseases. Now what are you going to do about it? The Acola Blue Atmospheric
[2:07:24.420 --> 2:07:28.900]  Water Generator is a low-cost way to take back control of you and your family's drinking

[2:07:59.900 --> 2:08:29.220]  Well, we are locked and loaded and ready to go for the third hour of this transmission.
[2:08:29.220 --> 2:08:37.180]  It's already Thursday, the 16th of July, 2009. And for this hour and five minutes into the
[2:08:37.180 --> 2:08:44.540]  next hour, we have Wayne Hall, CPA and brother of Representative Dr. Ron Paul. And of course
[2:08:44.540 --> 2:08:48.820]  Wayne appears in the Obama deception, discusses the Social Security scam, the Federal Reserve,
[2:08:48.820 --> 2:08:52.900]  how the country is bankrupt and we are under emergency powers. And the security of the
[2:08:52.900 --> 2:08:58.380]  Treasury is really in control of the country or how the Secretary of the Treasury is really
[2:08:58.380 --> 2:09:02.300]  in control of the country through the War Powers Act. In fact, let's play that scene
[2:09:02.300 --> 2:09:07.020]  of Wayne Paul in the Obama deception. Then we're going to go right to Wayne Paul. Here
[2:09:07.020 --> 2:09:08.020]  it is.
[2:09:08.020 --> 2:09:15.220]  In 1913, the Federal Reserve Act was passed. The floor of the house where three members
[2:09:15.220 --> 2:09:21.740]  of Congress were on the floor. At that time, they only needed a majority of votes to pass
[2:09:21.740 --> 2:09:32.060]  it. So in 1913, the Federal Reserve Act was passed. Twenty years later, 1933, under Roosevelt,
[2:09:32.060 --> 2:09:39.340]  the United States was declared bankrupt. And in 1933, the Federal Reserve Private Bank
[2:09:39.340 --> 2:09:47.820]  says, okay, USA, what are you going to pledge as collateral on the debt you owe me? What
[2:09:47.820 --> 2:09:57.460]  happened by 1936? Does anybody know? We instituted Social Security system and you and I and our
[2:09:57.460 --> 2:10:03.100]  children and our children's children were pledged as collateral on the debt of our government
[2:10:03.100 --> 2:10:09.340]  to the Federal Reserve. And that's where we're at today. It took twenty years to make this
[2:10:09.340 --> 2:10:18.180]  country bankrupt. And since then, our government has operated under emergency powers of our
[2:10:18.180 --> 2:10:26.500]  government. It is not the President that makes the decision in this country. It's the Secretary
[2:10:26.500 --> 2:10:34.300]  of Treasury who turns around and is put in there by the Federal Reserve to manage the
[2:10:34.300 --> 2:10:40.540]  bankruptcy. We've been in bankruptcy ever since. So to print seven hundred billion
[2:10:40.540 --> 2:10:45.900]  dollars and to give it away, how do they get away with it? The manager of the bankruptcy
[2:10:45.900 --> 2:10:51.900]  is told by the Federal Reserve, this is the way to go. That's where we're at today. Yes,
[2:10:51.900 --> 2:10:58.620]  we should point out, Congressman Ron Paul now has a huge amount of sponsors, a bill in
[2:10:58.620 --> 2:11:04.860]  the House of Representatives to abolish the private Federal Reserve. Alright, here we go folks. We're
[2:11:04.860 --> 2:11:10.140]  going to go ahead and go back now to our guest, Wayne Paul. Wayne, it's great to have you here
[2:11:10.140 --> 2:11:17.340]  with us today. It's good to be on board. Where are you joining us from today? I'm in East Texas at
[2:11:17.340 --> 2:11:25.340]  my home today. Fantastic, great to have you on with us. Wayne, there's so much to talk about,
[2:11:25.340 --> 2:11:32.540]  but let's begin with the issue you were just discussing, how this country was taken into
[2:11:32.540 --> 2:11:39.020]  receivership through fraud because these shysters, these rhinestone con artists, these flim flam
[2:11:39.020 --> 2:11:45.900]  artists, they create all this out of nothing and they basically buy up the world out of
[2:11:45.900 --> 2:11:52.220]  nothing and so they want to create a debt black hole, a system to bankrupt the planet
[2:11:52.220 --> 2:11:56.140]  to then bring in their new world order, their new bank of the world, which they admit we're going
[2:11:56.140 --> 2:12:01.100]  to be paying our carbon taxes to and you so eloquently broke that down, but can you further
[2:12:01.100 --> 2:12:05.100]  comment on that? Then we're going to go back to the beginning. I want to talk about you growing
[2:12:05.100 --> 2:12:12.460]  up with your brother outside Pittsburgh on a dairy farm and just what formed a great family like yours
[2:12:12.460 --> 2:12:17.820]  and then looking forward into some of the current things that are happening today. Well, I think
[2:12:17.820 --> 2:12:23.820]  the most fascinating thing is the bill that's on the floor of the house now as it relates
[2:12:24.460 --> 2:12:31.100]  to out of the bed. If somebody would have said to me five years ago that there would have been
[2:12:31.100 --> 2:12:39.660]  over 240 congressmen putting their name on the line to have the Federal Reserve Bank
[2:12:39.660 --> 2:12:49.180]  audited, how to never believe it, that alone tells you and I and your listeners that the
[2:12:49.180 --> 2:12:56.780]  understanding of how the Federal Reserve Bank works and what it does to turn around and confiscate
[2:12:56.780 --> 2:13:05.340]  our private property, it's an amazing feat and I think that's something that'll be changing the
[2:13:05.340 --> 2:13:13.180]  world if we can get that accomplished. Absolutely. I love it when your brothers on television and
[2:13:13.180 --> 2:13:18.860]  they say abolish the Federal Reserve, get rid of the income tax. How are we going to do that
[2:13:20.060 --> 2:13:24.860]  when we have to fund the government and Ron Paul always says this building behind me,
[2:13:24.860 --> 2:13:30.540]  the capital, was built for 100 plus years before we had this foreign banking takeover.
[2:13:30.540 --> 2:13:35.260]  Can you get into the nature of the Federal Reserve, the War Powers Act,
[2:13:35.980 --> 2:13:39.340]  go back through what you talked about in that video clip but in more detail,
[2:13:39.340 --> 2:13:45.340]  the nature of our rulers and it is amazing that five, ten years ago almost no one knew
[2:13:45.340 --> 2:13:50.300]  it was a private run for profit criminal group. Now it's a big national issue that nobody can
[2:13:50.300 --> 2:13:55.260]  audit it, that it says it's above the law, it won't tell Congress, Senator Sanders and others
[2:13:55.260 --> 2:13:58.860]  and your brother, the congressman Ron Paul say, where's the money, where'd it go and
[2:13:58.860 --> 2:14:03.500]  Renaki says, I'm not going to tell you. Everybody, even if they're dumbed down,
[2:14:03.500 --> 2:14:07.900]  knows fundamentally nobody's above the law and they're asking who are these private bankers that
[2:14:07.900 --> 2:14:12.460]  own everything and control the issuance of currency and credit. So break down kind of the
[2:14:12.460 --> 2:14:19.020]  history of this group for us and then more on what is it like for you fighting them for decades
[2:14:19.020 --> 2:14:28.620]  to now see it really, really starting to be on the run bleeding. I mean, it's a cornered rat.
[2:14:28.620 --> 2:14:34.780]  I think the fascinating thing about that is if you go to the Federal Reserve Act that was passed
[2:14:34.780 --> 2:14:44.540]  in 1913, in that act and in the bill, if anybody's interested, go on the web under government
[2:14:44.540 --> 2:14:52.140]  and read that act and they define that the green stuff we have in our pocket, it is defined
[2:14:52.860 --> 2:15:04.380]  as a Federal Reserve Accounting Unit Dollar. Take the first letter of each one of those words
[2:15:04.380 --> 2:15:16.700]  and what do you have? Federal Reserve Accounting Unit Dollar. They told us in 1913 what they were
[2:15:16.700 --> 2:15:27.900]  doing because those five letters spell fraud. So when you hear the vernacular that says
[2:15:27.900 --> 2:15:38.460]  fraud notes in your pocket, you understand where people got that thing and that having been created
[2:15:38.460 --> 2:15:52.140]  then, we're now at a point where printing dollars no longer can be sustained by the productivity
[2:15:52.140 --> 2:16:01.820]  of free enterprise. There's just too many dollars in circulation and I think as you say,
[2:16:01.820 --> 2:16:10.220]  uneducated or people that don't have the research done or haven't done their research understand
[2:16:10.220 --> 2:16:17.660]  when they go to the store and go to buy a loaf of bread and it's now $2.50 and I used to buy
[2:16:17.660 --> 2:16:27.580]  a loaf of bread for $29 and something's wrong with somewhere. Well, it absolutely is and now
[2:16:27.580 --> 2:16:34.620]  they're going to a whole new unit of a global SDR where the central banks don't even have it backed
[2:16:34.620 --> 2:16:40.300]  up by the nation states or by the people paying the income tax into the private Federal Reserve.
[2:16:40.300 --> 2:16:47.340]  Now it's just SDRs that are above even the nation state currency. So we're already going
[2:16:47.340 --> 2:16:52.940]  to this global cashless society right now. It's just a mopping up process to get rid of the national
[2:16:52.940 --> 2:16:57.980]  currencies or to convert them into you may still be able to pay with cash but there'll be a thumb
[2:16:57.980 --> 2:17:04.700]  print or a face scan at the time of sale fully bringing us into their control and then economically
[2:17:04.700 --> 2:17:09.660]  they can outlaw any underground economy and then socially engineer us and squeeze us and really get
[2:17:09.660 --> 2:17:15.340]  the control they want. But getting more into the fact that we are starting to draw blood on these
[2:17:15.340 --> 2:17:21.580]  people, we are in the fight, we have shaken them, we have rung their bell in this boxing match, you
[2:17:21.580 --> 2:17:26.380]  know, we've made them see Twee Bird as they say and now the public's figuring out they're not invincible,
[2:17:26.380 --> 2:17:30.860]  they're not on Mount Olympus above us. What does that like for you after decades of fighting these
[2:17:30.860 --> 2:17:37.340]  people to see that starting to happen? Well, I think the exciting thing for me is the fact
[2:17:37.340 --> 2:17:45.980]  that even though I've known this and studied it for 25 years, I think I'm reminded most of
[2:17:45.980 --> 2:17:51.980]  all in this past year of a young gentleman in our area who was a senior in high school
[2:17:53.020 --> 2:18:04.300]  and for his passage of his senior year, he had a regular senior thesis and he studied
[2:18:04.300 --> 2:18:13.500]  and wrote his thesis on the Federal Reserve system and how it operated. And for me, a young person
[2:18:13.500 --> 2:18:23.900]  aged 17, having the knowledge that this fellow has as to how it operates, got to be the most exciting
[2:18:23.900 --> 2:18:33.100]  thing. I look forward to the future only because I think as Congressman Paul pointed out, it's the
[2:18:33.100 --> 2:18:41.420]  education process that really counts and when we can see that in our young people, I can see right
[2:18:41.420 --> 2:18:48.860]  at the end of the tunnel that we're going to turn around and we're going to create a constitutional
[2:18:48.860 --> 2:18:55.980]  republic form of government and it's going to take all of us starting from the local
[2:18:55.980 --> 2:19:03.740]  city offices to the county, to the state, to the federal but it will change because of knowledge.
[2:19:05.740 --> 2:19:09.500]  And when we win, we're going to have a second renaissance in this country
[2:19:09.500 --> 2:19:13.180]  and appreciate it because you don't really appreciate something until you've had to fight
[2:19:13.180 --> 2:19:19.020]  for it or until you've lost it and then fought for it and gotten it back. I couldn't agree with you
[2:19:19.020 --> 2:19:25.980]  more. I am looking forward to that day and I intend to be here when that day happens.
[2:19:28.060 --> 2:19:32.940]  Well, so many times in history, tyrants and tyrannies collapse. I think Gandhi to paraphrase
[2:19:32.940 --> 2:19:36.940]  him said it looks like the dictator, the corrupt leaders are invincible but then suddenly they
[2:19:36.940 --> 2:19:42.060]  just collapse. You got to just keep throwing the punches in there and not giving up. No one
[2:19:42.060 --> 2:19:47.340]  agrees. That's like George Washington. When he finally won the war and they surrendered,
[2:19:47.340 --> 2:19:52.300]  he was stunned for several hours and didn't believe him, didn't understand after seven years
[2:19:52.300 --> 2:19:58.460]  of fighting. Right. Stay there, Wayne Paul, always amazing. This is his maiden voyage on radio with

[2:21:01.580 --> 2:21:07.820]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear. We've
[2:21:07.820 --> 2:21:12.780]  got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to
[2:21:12.780 --> 2:21:18.700]  see. The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest
[2:21:18.700 --> 2:21:24.460]  of the American people. Well, Obama's already fudging. Yeah, fudged since day one in this election.
[2:21:24.460 --> 2:21:29.660]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing
[2:21:29.660 --> 2:21:35.500]  the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[2:21:35.500 --> 2:21:43.260]  It's not about left to right. It's about a one world government. This film documents who Obama
[2:21:43.260 --> 2:21:49.980]  works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda. Get your copy of the Obama deception
[2:21:49.980 --> 2:21:57.900]  today at infowars.com or download it in super high quality at prisonplanet.tv. The Obama deception,
[2:21:57.900 --> 2:22:05.020]  the people strike back. Good day, Jim Newcomer from Midas Resources, July 16, 2009. Goal open this
[2:22:05.020 --> 2:22:12.060]  morning at $940. A one ounce gold coin can be purchased for $966.96, $483.48 for a half ounce,
[2:22:12.060 --> 2:22:19.180]  or $241.74 for the quarter ounce. That's $966.96, $483.48, or $241.74. Failout equals market
[2:22:19.180 --> 2:22:23.740]  distortions increase money supply while productivity is going down, loss readers receiving injections
[2:22:23.740 --> 2:22:27.820]  of liquidity while smaller companies are forced to concede. Companies too big to fail are now
[2:22:27.820 --> 2:22:31.820]  using the tax dollars to increase market share paying fat dividends. Are you wondering why
[2:22:31.820 --> 2:22:35.980]  supplies of gold and silver coins are decreasing rapidly, leaving the public scrambling to accumulate
[2:22:35.980 --> 2:22:40.540]  what's left? The occurrences values based on trust, fiscal responsibility. Is Congress and
[2:22:40.540 --> 2:22:44.540]  the White House acting responsibly earning your trust, or is it time to ensure your hard-earned
[2:22:44.540 --> 2:22:50.380]  wealth? Midas Resources offers economic insurance, gold and silver coins, $866.86, 2237. Do you

[2:24:07.420 --> 2:24:09.340]  You can run on for a long time.
[2:24:09.340 --> 2:24:25.100]  Run on for a long time. Run on for a long time. Sooner or later, gotta cut you down. Sooner or later, gotta cut you down.
[2:24:25.100 --> 2:24:31.580]  I like the Texas Ranger Credo, which is actually borrowed from one of the founding Texas Rangers.
[2:24:31.580 --> 2:24:36.860]  A man of the wrong can't stop a man in the right that keeps on coming.
[2:24:36.860 --> 2:24:42.700]  And that's what we've got to do, because these people, me and business, were fighting.
[2:24:42.700 --> 2:24:48.300]  Short segment right now, long one coming up. I wanted to get to some of the things that Wayne
[2:24:48.300 --> 2:24:52.780]  may never have talked about on air. First, then we'll get back into solutions and where this
[2:24:52.780 --> 2:24:58.860]  country's going, and his brother and the family, and now one of his nephews, Rand Paul, looks like,
[2:24:59.420 --> 2:25:06.700]  is going to run for the Congress. But go back to your rural upbringing, some stories about
[2:25:06.700 --> 2:25:14.460]  you and your brothers, about Ron, and about what it's been like for you. How you woke up,
[2:25:14.460 --> 2:25:20.540]  how he woke up, or were you guys born awake, being born to hardworking farmers, dairy farmers,
[2:25:21.500 --> 2:25:26.220]  all of you guys working from the time you were about six, seven years old? Were you guys born
[2:25:26.220 --> 2:25:32.460]  awake, or what was the process like? Let us into a window of the icon that is your brother,
[2:25:32.460 --> 2:25:39.100]  Dr. Ron Paul, and yourself, of course. Okay, we were born and raised in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania,
[2:25:39.980 --> 2:25:46.780]  small rural town, and my mother and father had a dairy milk processing and delivery business.
[2:25:47.580 --> 2:25:54.700]  It started out in the basement of our house, and my mom and dad worked seven days a week to process
[2:25:54.700 --> 2:26:03.500]  bottled milk and deliver it. And we were always required on Sundays to go to church Sunday morning,
[2:26:03.500 --> 2:26:10.540]  and my dad took off enough time to go to church. But he worked seven days a week up until I was
[2:26:10.540 --> 2:26:18.460]  in fifth grade. Now, I'm the youngest of five boys. Ron is the middle of the five of us.
[2:26:18.460 --> 2:26:25.900]  But we claim he's the spoiled one in the family because the two oldest ones paid the way for him,
[2:26:26.620 --> 2:26:31.340]  and then we were never allowed to do anything, but we always say Ron got away with all of it.
[2:26:33.180 --> 2:26:41.020]  I'm saying that because he can't rebut that on this radio show, so be careful. I might deny
[2:26:41.020 --> 2:26:51.180]  that later on. Anyway, my revelation into this knowledge started back in the early 70s,
[2:26:52.220 --> 2:27:01.740]  and it had to do with my representation of a taxpayer who, after I started to represent him,
[2:27:01.740 --> 2:27:14.140]  he ended up six weeks after I met him, passing away. And it was a direct result of the confrontation
[2:27:14.140 --> 2:27:23.340]  he had with the Internal Revenue Service. And I said to myself, if this is the way it is,
[2:27:23.340 --> 2:27:29.740]  I'm not going to ever do another tax return because something's not right in the system.
[2:27:29.740 --> 2:27:39.340]  So that was my awakening call, and that started my research, my documentation,
[2:27:40.140 --> 2:27:49.020]  and everything that I've learned from that point on has helped me and made me better understand.
[2:27:49.660 --> 2:27:56.540]  And I think when people understand and learn, even if they can't do anything about it,
[2:27:56.540 --> 2:28:02.940]  they're better off morally, they're better off spiritually, and they're better off in your
[2:28:02.940 --> 2:28:06.700]  dealings with their fellow man. That makes all the difference in the world.
[2:28:07.580 --> 2:28:15.500]  What woke your brother up? Tell us about Congressman Ron Paul, your brother.
[2:28:15.500 --> 2:28:23.020]  Well, I think Ron's timing was the fact that when he was in college and medical school
[2:28:23.020 --> 2:28:33.260]  and working, he always had spare time. And he got involved in research and study
[2:28:33.980 --> 2:28:43.180]  of Ludwig von Mises. And von Mises is the father of free enterprise Austrian economics.
[2:28:44.140 --> 2:28:50.140]  And there's a von Mises Institute that's in existence today that's extremely successful
[2:28:50.140 --> 2:28:54.780]  and continues to support free enterprise economics.
[2:28:54.780 --> 2:28:56.700]  And it's headed up by Lou Rockwell.
[2:28:56.700 --> 2:29:04.620]  That is correct. And it made a lot of sense to him, so he started to apply it
[2:29:05.740 --> 2:29:12.140]  not only in his professional life, but in his personal life and was extremely
[2:29:12.140 --> 2:29:18.620]  successful in the implementation of free enterprise economics.
[2:29:19.500 --> 2:29:25.580]  And it was at that time that he started to formulate the idea that he needed to seek
[2:29:25.580 --> 2:29:26.780]  this to other people.
[2:29:27.660 --> 2:29:30.700]  All right, stay there. Let's continue with this on the other side and also talk about
[2:29:30.700 --> 2:29:37.500]  your saga. You've had quite a story as well. And then we'll open the phones up for Wayne Paul,
[2:29:37.500 --> 2:29:45.900]  brother of Congressman Dr. Ron Paul, 1-800-259-9231, 1-800-259-9231.
[2:29:47.260 --> 2:29:49.740]  Stay with us. PrisonPlanet.tv is the website.
[2:29:51.420 --> 2:29:58.140]  We're on the march. The empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[2:31:00.060 --> 2:31:05.580]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator this
[2:31:05.580 --> 2:31:10.060]  summer. Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[2:31:10.060 --> 2:31:15.340]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you
[2:31:15.340 --> 2:31:20.460]  to have. It's true. Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology
[2:31:20.460 --> 2:31:25.340]  is coming. Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded,
[2:31:25.340 --> 2:31:29.420]  especially with the high demand summer months ahead. Number four, the hurricane and dangerous
[2:31:29.420 --> 2:31:33.580]  summer storm season is here again. Every year, thousands of families lose their power from
[2:31:33.580 --> 2:31:38.620]  weather-related outages. Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance
[2:31:38.620 --> 2:31:42.460]  and peace of mind. Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by
[2:31:42.460 --> 2:31:49.980]  Solutions from Science, a longtime sponsor of ours. You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[2:31:49.980 --> 2:31:56.060]  That's mysolarbackup.com. Remember, the government doesn't own the sun yet, so go to mysolarbackup.com

[2:32:03.900 --> 2:32:07.820]  it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever. We need to be
[2:32:07.820 --> 2:32:11.980]  independent, and food and water is the key. You'll never have to stand in a bread line
[2:32:11.980 --> 2:32:16.300]  if you have your own bread. You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care
[2:32:16.300 --> 2:32:20.540]  of your family in any emergency if you simply prepare. No one is going to take care of your
[2:32:20.540 --> 2:32:24.860]  family in the final equation, but you. You know, eFoodsDirect.com is still able to shift
[2:32:24.860 --> 2:32:29.580]  historical food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella genetic alteration, or Chinese imports,
[2:32:29.580 --> 2:32:35.500]  and they do it at almost half the cost of last year's grocery prices. Call 1-800-409-5633
[2:32:35.500 --> 2:32:40.140]  or on the web, go to eFoodsDirect.com. Visit eFoodsDirect.com and look over the

[2:33:24.220 --> 2:33:29.820]  He jumps on a big jet airplane and goes out to do interviews for his film, Invisible Enemies.
[2:33:30.460 --> 2:33:35.020]  That's what I'm off doing is doing interviews for the next film. We're going to go back to Wayne
[2:33:35.020 --> 2:33:40.380]  Paul here in just a moment and your phone calls. But before we do that, speaking of the free market,
[2:33:40.380 --> 2:33:44.700]  I want to tell you about some of the sponsors we have to make this radio show possible.
[2:33:44.700 --> 2:33:47.900]  I do believe in these sponsors. We only take sponsors that I believe in. I think they have
[2:33:47.900 --> 2:33:53.100]  great products. One of them is MySolarBackup.com. A lot of things can cut off our electrical power,
[2:33:53.100 --> 2:33:58.620]  hurricane, snow, ice storms. Literature should move towards getting off the grid and here's a good
[2:33:58.620 --> 2:34:03.180]  way to do just that. A solar power generator is now available from our longtime sponsor,
[2:34:03.180 --> 2:34:07.900]  Solutions from Science. You get an emergency power backup kit which consists of the PowerSource 1800
[2:34:07.900 --> 2:34:13.580]  watt generator and a high efficiency solar panel designed to provide endless electricity.
[2:34:13.580 --> 2:34:18.860]  Remember too that gas generators need gas. But in a blackout, gas pumps can't pump gas
[2:34:18.860 --> 2:34:22.700]  because they run on electricity. It's the perfect emergency backup for trouble times. The government
[2:34:22.700 --> 2:34:27.340]  doesn't own the sun yet, folks. So make your move today. That's MySolarBackup.com. That's
[2:34:27.340 --> 2:34:36.460]  MySolarBackup.com. Or give them a call toll free, 877-327-0365. 877-327-0365.
[2:34:37.660 --> 2:34:42.540]  And one other sponsor I wanted to let you know about is HomeGain. You can check out Max Little
[2:34:42.540 --> 2:34:51.100]  Orange Gorilla at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com. It's a completely free site. It is advertiser
[2:34:51.100 --> 2:34:54.940]  driven. It's a fabulous site. Been around for more than 10 years. My favorite thing they have is
[2:34:54.940 --> 2:35:00.700]  the home sale maximizer. You put in what type of house you have, the region it's in, the most
[2:35:00.700 --> 2:35:06.780]  inexpensive upgrades to do, the best resale, little things you can do, little tricks that really help
[2:35:06.780 --> 2:35:11.500]  get it sold for a higher price. They have the street view thing that's free as well. They have a
[2:35:11.500 --> 2:35:15.500]  free estimate. You type in your home address, you'll get a free estimate of your home's value
[2:35:15.500 --> 2:35:22.300]  from the internal system that the realtors are seeing. It's homegain.com, H-O-M-E-G-A-I-N.com,
[2:35:22.300 --> 2:35:32.060]  homegain.com. Okay, going back to Wayne Paul, Dr. Ron Paul, Congressman Ron Paul's brother,
[2:35:32.060 --> 2:35:38.140]  finishing up with your upbringing. So your brother gets into the free market economics. He's a
[2:35:38.140 --> 2:35:44.620]  doctor. Then I guess you sort of get involved with very Goldwater somehow. Tell us more about
[2:35:44.620 --> 2:35:53.180]  the inside scoop on your brother. Well, I think his total goal and effort when he first decided to
[2:35:53.180 --> 2:36:00.700]  run for Congress was to educate people in understanding free enterprise economics.
[2:36:01.580 --> 2:36:08.700]  And he said to Carol his wife the first time he ran, he said, don't worry Carol,
[2:36:08.700 --> 2:36:14.860]  I'm not going to win. I just want to get the message out. Well, the first time he didn't win.
[2:36:15.580 --> 2:36:21.020]  But she says, what are you going to do if you do win? Well, the next time he ran, he won.
[2:36:22.140 --> 2:36:34.620]  Now, when he first ran for Congress back in the mid-70s, he had a platform, one-page platform
[2:36:34.620 --> 2:36:42.860]  he was running on. And it just so happens that my wife gave him his first contribution.
[2:36:43.660 --> 2:36:51.820]  And he sent her a thank you note. And the second page was his platform of what he was running on,
[2:36:51.820 --> 2:37:00.220]  which was basically free enterprise economics. But if you were to read that single page today,
[2:37:00.220 --> 2:37:07.820]  you would think he wrote it yesterday because he's never changed. And I think that's the most
[2:37:07.820 --> 2:37:17.180]  consistent thing that anybody can ever say as far as my brother's concern is he's never wavered
[2:37:17.740 --> 2:37:27.340]  from the truth and from the facts and from the Constitution. And he has just been amazing
[2:37:27.340 --> 2:37:31.340]  and steadfast on that. And I think people today now realize that.
[2:37:32.220 --> 2:37:37.260]  And you judge a tree by its fruits. Do you remember any of the things on that one-page
[2:37:37.260 --> 2:37:48.460]  platform? Well, I can't remember right off except while I'm talking, we'll find it. It may be my
[2:37:48.460 --> 2:37:53.340]  wife. Sure, sure, sure. Coming up after the next break, if you can, it's just very, very interesting
[2:37:53.340 --> 2:37:59.820]  history here. And as your brother has humbly and rightfully said, he is just an articulate,
[2:37:59.820 --> 2:38:07.900]  genteel, intelligent, focal point. And two years ago, well now a year and a half ago at Bilderberg,
[2:38:08.540 --> 2:38:12.060]  our inside sources have been proven to be very, very accurate, said that they were worried not
[2:38:12.060 --> 2:38:17.980]  about Ron Paul winning during that campaign, but that they were worried about the movement,
[2:38:17.980 --> 2:38:22.940]  that the biggest movement now in high schools and universities wasn't the controlled left paradigm
[2:38:22.940 --> 2:38:27.660]  or the controlled right paradigm of the collectivist, but that people were now rediscovering
[2:38:27.660 --> 2:38:32.380]  the Bill of Rights Constitution and becoming free market constitutionalists and that people
[2:38:32.380 --> 2:38:36.780]  were discovering the private fellow reserve. And I think they had well founded fears. Now,
[2:38:36.780 --> 2:38:42.300]  here we are a year and a half later and we've gone from almost, and I know I keep repeating this,
[2:38:42.300 --> 2:38:47.180]  no one knowing the Fed was private being laughed at. To now the enemies had to come out in the open
[2:38:47.180 --> 2:38:51.340]  and go, okay, we're private, but we run things for your own good. And if you audit us, we'll cause a
[2:38:51.340 --> 2:38:59.340]  depression, basically terrorism, economic terrorism. And we have open announcements of a new bank of
[2:38:59.340 --> 2:39:04.140]  the world will pay our carbon taxes too. And now for world government and hundreds and hundreds
[2:39:04.140 --> 2:39:10.220]  of articles a month pushing this on us and nobody's buying it. All the things we talked about have
[2:39:10.220 --> 2:39:14.140]  come true and are happening. We're now at this key battle point in history that your brother talked
[2:39:14.140 --> 2:39:18.540]  about that I talked about, that when the crisis came, when the bankers were imploding the world
[2:39:18.540 --> 2:39:24.300]  economy by design to bring in their system, that was a weak point for them. Their great moment of
[2:39:24.300 --> 2:39:30.620]  triumph, but also their weak point. If we point out, hey, the emperors butt naked, this is a fraud,
[2:39:30.620 --> 2:39:36.940]  the emperors new clothes. And now to really see it's so viral, this idea of liberty.
[2:39:39.900 --> 2:39:44.860]  I mean, this shows us we can have victory. This gives us hope. It shows people that had kind of
[2:39:44.860 --> 2:39:51.660]  given up who had been fighting for decades like yourself, not saying you ever did, that none
[2:39:51.660 --> 2:39:57.340]  of this was done for naught. That the seeds we planted that a lot of people ignored are now
[2:39:57.340 --> 2:40:02.380]  sprouting in the minds of men and women everywhere. Can you speak to just the amazing revolution of
[2:40:02.380 --> 2:40:08.940]  liberty and freedom we're seeing? Well, I have a book sitting in front of me that I continually
[2:40:08.940 --> 2:40:17.820]  tomorrow and reread. It's called the history of our national debt, the coming battle. It's written
[2:40:17.820 --> 2:40:28.060]  by Lorraine and Paul Wolters. And if somebody really wants to understand where we're at, if they
[2:40:28.060 --> 2:40:34.700]  read this history, you know, didn't they republish that from an 1898 book and I wrote the forward?
[2:40:34.700 --> 2:40:43.340]  That is correct. That's an excellent book. And it is so enlightening that it's worth
[2:40:44.540 --> 2:40:50.060]  the read by anybody interested in it. I keep reading it because I learn something new every
[2:40:50.060 --> 2:40:53.500]  time. And for those that don't know, this was a guy going, I read it 10 years ago when he
[2:40:53.500 --> 2:40:59.020]  republished it in banking, who saw all this coming and said, we're being taken over by bankers
[2:40:59.020 --> 2:41:08.460]  15 years before they did it. Yeah, that's correct. In Ron's letter to my wife, he says,
[2:41:08.460 --> 2:41:21.420]  I want to cut spending, cut taxes, cut inflation. When I have honest money, I want to cut crime.
[2:41:21.420 --> 2:41:28.380]  I want to let people live in peace and security. And I want to get rid of government controls
[2:41:28.380 --> 2:41:37.020]  and regulations. And that was basically one sheet of paper that he wrote back in 1974,
[2:41:37.020 --> 2:41:45.020]  which is the first time he ran. And his motto at that time was to say, put big government on a diet.
[2:41:48.620 --> 2:41:56.220]  And that was that was one of the first advertisements that he put out in mid 70s
[2:41:56.220 --> 2:42:00.620]  out of it. Speaking of your brother, let me ask you a question, Wayne Paul.
[2:42:02.140 --> 2:42:06.140]  I challenged him about two months before he announced for president privately on the phone
[2:42:06.780 --> 2:42:10.940]  when he was on as a guest during the break. I said, please run, you got to do it just to educate
[2:42:10.940 --> 2:42:16.060]  the public. You morally cannot say no. I know you don't want to fly around and do the thousands
[2:42:16.060 --> 2:42:19.820]  of speeches. I know you already have an exhausting schedule. I know you're a real statesman, but
[2:42:19.820 --> 2:42:25.020]  I said, you must run for president. And I said, and I said, I know you're going to get attacked
[2:42:25.020 --> 2:42:29.180]  if you don't win later. But I said, regardless, you'll educate a lot of people and out of that
[2:42:29.180 --> 2:42:33.420]  big awakening, even bigger awakenings will happen. And he said, no, no, that's what a lot of other
[2:42:33.420 --> 2:42:40.620]  people are telling me, family and others. And he said, we'll see soon. And so many other people
[2:42:40.620 --> 2:42:46.140]  were talking to him behind the scenes. This is history. Can you tell us what was going on,
[2:42:46.140 --> 2:42:49.180]  what the debates were, what the thoughts were on him running for president?
[2:42:49.180 --> 2:43:00.380]  Well, I think it all boils down to whether the people were ready to hear the message
[2:43:02.540 --> 2:43:13.260]  in such a large arena as running for president. And I think he became amazed
[2:43:13.260 --> 2:43:22.140]  at the crowd, the numbers of people, the contributions he received, the effort that
[2:43:22.140 --> 2:43:27.420]  was put forth by people all over the country, the number of young people that came out and
[2:43:27.420 --> 2:43:35.820]  supported him. It actually, I think, blew him away and made him a very humble individual
[2:43:35.820 --> 2:43:44.940]  because he never expected it to be as big as it really was. So I think he was
[2:43:46.460 --> 2:43:54.540]  humbled by it. I think he was in awe by it. And I think every hour of every moment of every time
[2:43:54.540 --> 2:44:02.620]  he spent doing that, he is absolutely delighted to have done it. And I think it continues today
[2:44:02.620 --> 2:44:09.340]  with his campaign for a Liberty program that he's working on now. Wayne, I want to talk more about
[2:44:09.340 --> 2:44:14.700]  the whole global picture with you and then take some calls. But some funny or interesting stories
[2:44:14.700 --> 2:44:20.460]  about your brother or your family, because people just love to hear them, that you've never told
[2:44:20.460 --> 2:44:27.180]  before or that you had never told on the radio before. Some interesting stuff about the young
[2:44:27.180 --> 2:44:35.500]  Ron Paul. Well, I think one of the most interesting things that I think of is he used to work in the
[2:44:35.500 --> 2:44:44.620]  drugstore. So we called him the soda jerk of the day. And he would use a bicycle to go a mile,
[2:44:44.620 --> 2:44:52.540]  work, and then come home. And he always worked late in the evening up till 10 o'clock to close
[2:44:52.540 --> 2:45:01.900]  the store and then back home. Well, he always had a ritual in his own mind as to how quickly he
[2:45:01.900 --> 2:45:10.380]  could get home till he was always timing himself. But one evening he was coming home and going up
[2:45:10.380 --> 2:45:17.020]  the hill and he was pumping so hard and so fast, they began to look in front of him and he ran
[2:45:17.020 --> 2:45:27.580]  into a parked car. And that parked car demolished the front of his bike. But he picked up the
[2:45:27.580 --> 2:45:33.980]  bike and walked the other half mile to get home. And when he got home, his collarbone was sticking
[2:45:33.980 --> 2:45:43.420]  outside of his shirt. But that's just the type of person he was. And he wanted to make sure nobody
[2:45:43.420 --> 2:45:51.580]  took his bike till he dragged it home with him. That's just the way he is. And most of the five
[2:45:51.580 --> 2:46:00.460]  of us are fairly competitive. My oldest brother has his PhD in mathematics. The next brother is
[2:46:00.460 --> 2:46:08.460]  the doctor of divinity. And of course, Ron has three different degrees in medicine. My next brother
[2:46:08.460 --> 2:46:16.140]  has a doctor of divinity. Also, so I have a brother who's a Luther minister and one that's a
[2:46:16.140 --> 2:46:21.900]  Presbyterian minister. Good quality, good quality salt of the earth. And you're a CPA, right?
[2:46:21.900 --> 2:46:26.860]  That's correct. They wanted me to be an undertaker so that they could take care of everybody,
[2:46:26.860 --> 2:46:32.940]  bring him into the world, raise him, educate him, and I could bury him. So we decided that if I did
[2:46:32.940 --> 2:46:43.180]  that, I would have a monopoly on life and the government would let me do it. Just amazing stories
[2:46:43.180 --> 2:46:52.060]  hearing that. Some of the family background, is the family on both sides German or where do the
[2:46:52.060 --> 2:46:58.220]  Pauls come from? Well, my grandfather came to this country that's 12 year old from Germany
[2:46:58.220 --> 2:47:07.980]  and came after his father came here before him. My mother was French Harish from Ulze,
[2:47:07.980 --> 2:47:21.260]  Florin. But I think it was the close knit family and our Christian ties that really was a blowwork
[2:47:21.260 --> 2:47:28.380]  of our lives. One of the other interesting things about my brother and he still has that when he
[2:47:28.380 --> 2:47:36.300]  first went to Congress, he bought a little Chevy Chevette to go from his apartment to Congress
[2:47:36.300 --> 2:47:45.580]  every day. And that Chevette was two doors green. He still has it by the way, but there's pictures
[2:47:45.580 --> 2:47:55.020]  out of that Chevette next to Tipo Neal's limousine. And he obviously was proud of showing that in his
[2:47:55.020 --> 2:48:01.900]  congressional office or at home. So it was the interesting contrast between a very liberal
[2:48:01.900 --> 2:48:07.100]  individual spending your money in a very conservative just trying to represent you.
[2:48:07.740 --> 2:48:12.060]  Absolutely. I want to take calls in the next segment, but shifting gears in the big picture.
[2:48:12.060 --> 2:48:19.500]  Eugenics. I know you study banking, the Federal Reserve, but the overall plans of the globalist,
[2:48:19.500 --> 2:48:23.420]  you told me you've seen the Obama deception that you're in. Give me your view on Eugenics,
[2:48:23.420 --> 2:48:29.660]  the master plan, the type of people that are the collectivist and the type of societies they build.
[2:48:29.660 --> 2:48:36.380]  You know, it really is an illustration of what the price is to pay if we that aren't parasites
[2:48:36.380 --> 2:48:44.620]  don't get things under control. We leave the world to these people. Yes. And that's difficult to
[2:48:44.620 --> 2:48:54.460]  really discuss and talk about because it's in an area that, you know, I looked at my life and our
[2:48:54.460 --> 2:49:03.100]  family's life. And as long as we stay the course and understand our responsibility, we believe
[2:49:03.100 --> 2:49:10.300]  that those types of things will get settled by a much higher power than us and that it is just
[2:49:10.300 --> 2:49:17.340]  something that at this stage of our lives that we have to talk about, learn about and try to
[2:49:17.340 --> 2:49:27.980]  understand, but it's difficult to determine how we might fight it. It's just, it's just incredible
[2:49:27.980 --> 2:49:32.300]  to really see the neural order come out in the open and un-cloak itself, but it's even more
[2:49:32.300 --> 2:49:38.060]  incredible to see the people rise against it. It's just so exciting. Oh, I think we live in the most
[2:49:38.060 --> 2:49:45.900]  exciting times of our life and I guess I'm looking forward to it. We're going to come back and take
[2:49:45.900 --> 2:49:50.780]  two quick segments of phone calls for Wayne Paul and we'll give out any websites or any contact
[2:49:50.780 --> 2:49:55.500]  in for any books you think we should read, you know, from your perspective. But I did want to bring
[2:49:55.500 --> 2:50:01.020]  up a little side issue of the attacks on your brother and the videos finally out of it. I think
[2:50:01.020 --> 2:50:07.580]  he did very well getting past the guy and getting out of there. But what do you think of that horrible
[2:50:07.580 --> 2:50:13.660]  Sasha Cohen baron trying to set up your brother? Of course it blew up in his face or are you even
[2:50:13.660 --> 2:50:24.140]  aware of that? I am vaguely aware of it and saw a little bit of it, but I often get back and admire
[2:50:24.140 --> 2:50:34.460]  my brother because he believes as long as you're telling the truth and as long as you're putting
[2:50:34.460 --> 2:50:41.020]  forth the right effort, those types of attacks won't last very long. I kind of like seeing him
[2:50:41.020 --> 2:50:44.380]  get mad though. For those that don't know, we haven't played it because we're not been given
[2:50:44.380 --> 2:50:49.580]  an attention. I might though. I mean as the video is out now, Ron Paul almost pops him and it looks
[2:50:49.580 --> 2:50:54.060]  like shoves him. He's like get out of here. It's kind of like you tell a cow to get on the road.
[2:50:55.500 --> 2:50:59.100]  Just just incredible. But the media tried to demonize him for that.
[2:51:01.100 --> 2:51:06.460]  As you already know, drinking pure high alkaline pH water is the most important factor in maintaining
[2:51:06.460 --> 2:51:11.980]  high energy and vibrant health. Most experts agree that the water you drink should be at a pH level
[2:51:11.980 --> 2:51:17.580]  of eight or higher. Alcovision plasma pH drops combine a unique formula of the most alkaline
[2:51:17.580 --> 2:51:22.940]  ingredients. Using plasma pH drops is one of the best ways to make your water alkaline to help you
[2:51:22.940 --> 2:51:28.540]  get rid of acid and regain your health and energy. Simply put, 10 drops per liter of water you drink
[2:51:28.540 --> 2:51:34.140]  to raise the pH to the ultimate level. Alkalizing water helps your body rid itself of acidic waste
[2:51:34.140 --> 2:51:40.060]  and increases the oxygen content of your body. Disease organisms like bacteria and cancer cannot
[2:51:40.060 --> 2:51:45.820]  survive in an alkaline high pH environment. Order your bottle of alcovision plasma pH drops now

[2:52:01.580 --> 2:52:07.420]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[2:52:07.420 --> 2:52:12.940]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong,
[2:52:12.940 --> 2:52:19.100]  just as well-funded. The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is
[2:52:19.100 --> 2:52:24.220]  working for the best interests of the American people. While Obama's already fudging, fudged
[2:52:24.220 --> 2:52:29.020]  since day one in this election. If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of
[2:52:29.020 --> 2:52:36.300]  personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs,
[2:52:36.300 --> 2:52:41.820]  that's fascism. It's not about left or right, it's about a one-world government. This film
[2:52:41.820 --> 2:52:49.100]  documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda. Get your copy of the
[2:52:49.100 --> 2:52:56.300]  Obama deception today at infowars.com or download it in super high quality at prisonplanet.tv.
[2:52:56.300 --> 2:53:03.580]  The Obama deception. The people strike back. It's a new year full of uncertainties.
[2:53:03.580 --> 2:53:08.940]  People are being laid off in record numbers. The price of food continues to rise and the economy
[2:53:08.940 --> 2:53:14.060]  continues to falter. You know that you need to prepare, and maybe you've been putting it off,

[2:54:07.020 --> 2:54:12.540]  long ago, starting this fight against the Federal Reserve. They even kidnapped congressman's kids
[2:54:12.540 --> 2:54:17.340]  and killed them to try to shut it down. But here we are. You can feel the momentum shifting.
[2:54:17.340 --> 2:54:24.540]  No matter what events, the private bank stays, no matter what scams they run, their days are numbered.
[2:54:25.180 --> 2:54:29.420]  The momentum is shifted against them and they know their destruction, their defeat is inevitable.
[2:54:31.500 --> 2:54:37.340]  Let's take a few final calls here for Wayne Paul. Let's talk to Ronnie in Texas, Steve,
[2:54:37.340 --> 2:54:40.620]  J.K., Philippe and others. Ronnie, you're on the air with Wayne Paul. Go ahead.
[2:54:40.620 --> 2:54:47.420]  Thank you. Thank you, Sir Wayne Paul. You're number four for me. I'm so honored to speak to you. I spoke
[2:54:47.420 --> 2:54:52.860]  with obviously Dr. Paul and Carol and his other brother, Randy and you. But I have a question for
[2:54:52.860 --> 2:54:59.180]  you and a couple of comments. But one photo that I saw while I was campaigning in Iowa for Dr. Paul
[2:54:59.180 --> 2:55:05.580]  was of Dr. Paul in a baseball uniform. And I wasn't sure if he either played pro baseball or just in
[2:55:05.580 --> 2:55:14.940]  college. Well, that was a congressional baseball game that the Congress took on, I think it was
[2:55:14.940 --> 2:55:22.460]  the Washington Senators, and Ron got the Astros to send him a uniform. And oddly enough, in that
[2:55:22.460 --> 2:55:29.180]  ball game, Ron hit a home run. Well, thank you, as you know, he's a founding father among us now,
[2:55:29.180 --> 2:55:35.900]  and the force is with him. And my question though, my major question though is, like you,
[2:55:37.100 --> 2:55:42.380]  I know he's not in favor of, or I'm assuming like you, he's not in favor of generally people doing
[2:55:42.380 --> 2:55:48.220]  drugs. But Dr. Paul is more vehemently opposed to our own continually counterproductive war on
[2:55:48.780 --> 2:55:54.780]  pot smokers and hemp enthusiasts. So, equating alcohol with THC is a lie. And alcohol is,
[2:55:54.780 --> 2:56:00.460]  you know, with the fetal alcohol syndrome, et cetera, it's a toxic poison. And THC is non-toxic
[2:56:00.460 --> 2:56:06.220]  medicine. So, listen, I appreciate your call. Yeah, your comments on drug decriminalization,
[2:56:06.220 --> 2:56:12.060]  non-legalization, like Soros wants, decriminalization, so that we don't spend all our time and energy
[2:56:12.060 --> 2:56:19.340]  locking up people that need treatment. And I agree with that. I think Ron's belief and my belief
[2:56:19.340 --> 2:56:27.820]  are very similar in that, that that is a moral issue, that it is a personal choice of people.
[2:56:28.460 --> 2:56:36.380]  It doesn't mean that we condone it. It only means that we should help that individual
[2:56:37.100 --> 2:56:43.660]  so that those things do not become addictive and they do not start to control their life.
[2:56:43.660 --> 2:56:50.780]  And that's the issue. Look, areas of Europe have decriminalized heroin and in some areas
[2:56:50.780 --> 2:56:55.500]  it's cut it by half. Everywhere it's gone down at least by 25%. People can pull those numbers up,
[2:56:56.380 --> 2:57:00.780]  different numbers per country, different cities, but it's all a massive decrease. And people stop
[2:57:00.780 --> 2:57:05.500]  robbing your house for your stereo and computer because the stuff is super cheap and it's from
[2:57:05.500 --> 2:57:13.100]  a kind of government or city dispensary. And probably 80% of those people behind bars in prisons
[2:57:13.100 --> 2:57:18.620]  would not be there if it wasn't for that. Well, plus they admit our troops guard the
[2:57:18.620 --> 2:57:23.820]  poppy fields in Afghanistan and it's up nine times. I mean, they're shipping it in. I mean,
[2:57:23.820 --> 2:57:28.780]  of course the elites do that. We're talking about hundreds of billions a year of secret
[2:57:28.780 --> 2:57:32.940]  money. They get to fractionally reserve loan out. Let's take one more call here right in
[2:57:32.940 --> 2:57:37.580]  this hour and we'll come back five more minutes. Stephen Canada, you're on the year. Go ahead.
[2:57:37.580 --> 2:57:44.780]  Hi there, Alex. I'm a longtime listener, a big time fan. I got a comment which will
[2:57:44.780 --> 2:57:51.100]  lead into a question for Mr. Paul there. My comment is about the HR 2454,
[2:57:53.740 --> 2:57:56.700]  the Climate Change Act that just got passed there in the States.
[2:57:57.180 --> 2:57:59.340]  It would pass the House. It hadn't passed the Senate.
[2:58:00.140 --> 2:58:05.580]  It hasn't yet, eh? That was actually one of my questions. If that does pass, I just want your
[2:58:05.580 --> 2:58:10.380]  listeners to know that there's a great video out there called the Great Global Warming Swindle
[2:58:11.180 --> 2:58:14.700]  and it's available on YouTube and Google Video and all those places.
[2:58:14.700 --> 2:58:17.980]  Yeah, it's free. It's incredible. It's called The Climatologist and Scientist.
[2:58:18.780 --> 2:58:22.380]  Thank you. I'm going to jump. Great points. We're going to come back in 70 seconds
[2:58:22.380 --> 2:58:27.500]  with Wayne Paul, Ron Paul's brother and an activist against tyranny as well.
[2:58:28.940 --> 2:58:31.900]  And I guess because they chip off the old block because he is Ron's younger brother,
[2:58:31.900 --> 2:58:38.300]  one of his younger brothers. And we will, we'll ask him about the global warming tax.
[2:58:42.860 --> 2:58:48.700]  Thank you for listening to GCN. Be sure to visit GCNLive.com today.
[2:58:50.780 --> 2:58:55.020]  Hello, friends. This is Alex Jones and I want each of you to ask yourself this question.
[2:58:55.020 --> 2:59:00.220]  Do you really know what's in your tap water? In a recent study conducted by a major environmental
[2:59:00.220 --> 2:59:05.100]  auditor, they found that over 260 chemicals in pollutants are present in municipal drinking
[2:59:05.100 --> 2:59:09.340]  water. Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive, immune and
[2:59:09.340 --> 2:59:14.620]  developmental system diseases. Now, what are you going to do about it? The Acola Blue Atmospheric
[2:59:14.620 --> 2:59:19.500]  Water Generator is a low-cost way to take back control of you and your family's drinking water.
[2:59:19.500 --> 2:59:24.300]  The Acola Blue 28 produces up to seven gallons of water from the humidity in the atmosphere
[2:59:24.300 --> 2:59:28.940]  and uses state-of-the-art carbon filtration, reverse osmosis, and ultra-violent light
[2:59:28.940 --> 2:59:34.860]  sterilization techniques. That's right, clean water right from the air you breathe. Order today
[2:59:34.860 --> 2:59:48.060]  by calling 1-800-691-6043. That's 1-800-691-6043. Or visit Acola Blue on the web at www.ecoloblu.com

[3:00:11.900 --> 3:00:16.380]  All right, final minutes. There's plain polls from where your phone calls, then General Stubblebine
[3:00:16.380 --> 3:00:24.860]  and Dr. Lebo will be joining us to talk about eugenics. Wayne, global warming tax over every
[3:00:24.860 --> 3:00:29.980]  facet of our lives, federal inspections, total federalization, eugenics agenda for the control
[3:00:29.980 --> 3:00:34.860]  freaks around our lives, your take on the global warming cap and trade, and on eugenics.
[3:00:40.700 --> 3:00:46.220]  Wayne, are you there? Yes, sir. Okay, great. Your take on the global warming tax and
[3:00:46.220 --> 3:00:56.140]  eugenics. Well, as far as global warming is concerned, I do think the cat is out of the bag
[3:00:56.140 --> 3:01:07.580]  that a lot of that is hoped. I think if we learn anything from it, we should be more aware of
[3:01:07.580 --> 3:01:14.780]  our environment and take better care of it. But I don't, I think global warming is coming
[3:01:14.780 --> 3:01:21.180]  on over the last 200 years that I don't think there's anything different today than it was
[3:01:21.180 --> 3:01:26.620]  when we settled this country. Well, I agree with you and they piggyback legitimate environmental
[3:01:26.620 --> 3:01:31.260]  issues that could be handled civilly. You do some toxic waste dumping on somebody,
[3:01:31.260 --> 3:01:37.740]  they can take you to the cleaners or get you put in prison. But they love these new systems that
[3:01:37.740 --> 3:01:46.060]  are extra judicial outside the system. And they mean business. Go ahead. Well, I don't have enough
[3:01:46.060 --> 3:01:51.500]  of your property. I want a little bit more. So they tried different ways to plunder your property.
[3:01:52.060 --> 3:01:56.940]  And that's in effect with cap and trade going to do. And then look at government being the biggest
[3:01:56.940 --> 3:02:02.540]  polluter out there. Absolutely. I mean, this is like CPS is five to seven times more likely,
[3:02:02.540 --> 3:02:06.460]  depending on what state to abuse your children. They're the most dangerous people out there.
[3:02:06.460 --> 3:02:09.820]  So they're the ones that watch the kids. I mean, give me a break. Every pedophile
[3:02:10.460 --> 3:02:13.980]  in the world wants to be a CPS worker. I mean, put two and two together, of course.
[3:02:13.980 --> 3:02:17.980]  Jay in Oregon, last caller for our guests, Wayne Paul, Ron Paul's brother. Go ahead.
[3:02:17.980 --> 3:02:24.220]  Hi, Wayne. Hi, Jay. Actually, I got two parts of a question, two questions for you. Go ahead. And
[3:02:25.180 --> 3:02:30.780]  question one, how do you reconcile the cognitive dissonance of working
[3:02:31.420 --> 3:02:35.420]  to quell what you guys are calling the rise of the one world government, one world economy,
[3:02:35.420 --> 3:02:41.820]  the one world currency, when it's clear in the word of God that this is going to happen?
[3:02:43.580 --> 3:02:48.300]  Yeah, it was clear in 70 AD. They thought it was the end of the world. And when Jerusalem was sacked,
[3:02:48.300 --> 3:02:51.820]  they thought it was the end of the world when Hitler was killing people. You've had all these
[3:02:51.820 --> 3:02:58.940]  different empires. How do you reconcile in the word of God that it's our job to fight evil,
[3:02:58.940 --> 3:03:05.900]  whatever the cost may be? It's not to us to choose. It's us to do the right thing.
[3:03:07.420 --> 3:03:11.740]  Duty is ours. Consequence belongs to God. I mean, is that what you're saying? Or what are you
[3:03:11.740 --> 3:03:17.820]  getting at? Well, Alex, I know your position real well. I was asking Mr. Paul. Go ahead.
[3:03:17.820 --> 3:03:24.700]  We'll let you go. Mr. Paul, go ahead. Okay. My answer to that question is it doesn't change my
[3:03:24.700 --> 3:03:33.740]  Christian obligation as to how I live and how I am a steward of the property I've been interested
[3:03:33.740 --> 3:03:46.220]  with. Regardless of what may be God's will, I have been instructed by the word to live a life
[3:03:46.220 --> 3:03:54.700]  that is a stewardship life in terms of the property I have, in terms of the people I
[3:03:55.660 --> 3:04:03.740]  associate with my peer group, and my responsibility is to do it according to God's word.
[3:04:04.460 --> 3:04:09.500]  And God's going to take care of the rest of the things. So I'm not going to worry about it.
[3:04:09.500 --> 3:04:16.380]  I still have to fight the battle that the Federal Reserve system is an evil system
[3:04:17.020 --> 3:04:23.340]  and needs to be abolished. It doesn't change. Yeah, it was the pastors that led the Revolutionary
[3:04:23.340 --> 3:04:29.260]  War against England. And a few of the pastors did say it's God's will lay down Romans 13 out of
[3:04:29.260 --> 3:04:33.420]  context. Look at the prophets. Look at the whole Bible. It's about standing up against evil and
[3:04:33.420 --> 3:04:39.420]  fighting evil. Callers, that answer your question, Jay? It does enough. Thank you. You bet. I mean,
[3:04:39.420 --> 3:04:44.140]  these devil churches funded by the Rockefellers publicly, the World Council of Churches,
[3:04:44.140 --> 3:04:51.100]  are telling people stand down. And it is incredible. Wayne Paul, amazing having you on. Thank you.
[3:04:51.980 --> 3:04:56.780]  Thank you. I appreciate it. We appreciate you being on and he's in the Obama deception, folks.
[3:04:56.780 --> 3:04:59.820]  Let me say bye to you during the break, Wayne. Stay with us.
[3:04:59.820 --> 3:05:05.260]  This is Alex Jones. And I want to tell you again about a company that has supported us in the
[3:05:05.260 --> 3:05:10.300]  Truth Movement for years. Inner Health Botanicals. This company produces the highest quality super
[3:05:10.300 --> 3:05:16.300]  food around called Inner Food. My wife just loves the stuff. And now the health ranger Mike Adams
[3:05:16.300 --> 3:05:22.620]  has awarded Inner Food, his editor's choice award for best super food of 2009. Inner Food is loaded
[3:05:22.620 --> 3:05:27.740]  with 20 great organic ingredients, no fillers, no sweeteners. It would be impossible to blend
[3:05:27.740 --> 3:05:32.620]  this up for a better price. And their formula really works. This is the real thing for the
[3:05:32.620 --> 3:05:38.380]  great health you need. Try the Nutra Cafe. They're great organic coffee infused with polysaccharides
[3:05:38.380 --> 3:05:43.180]  that boost the immune system. A truly healthy coffee that tastes great. And take it from me,
[3:05:43.180 --> 3:05:47.020]  folks. It really does taste great. Don't forget to try their other great products.

[3:06:05.020 --> 3:06:09.420]  power generator this summer. Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple
[3:06:09.420 --> 3:06:14.780]  your electric bill. Number two, our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric
[3:06:14.780 --> 3:06:19.340]  company allows you to have. It's true. Total government control of electricity in the name
[3:06:19.340 --> 3:06:24.380]  of smart grid technology is coming. Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is
[3:06:24.380 --> 3:06:28.460]  dangerously overloaded, especially with the high demand summer months ahead. Number four,
[3:06:28.460 --> 3:06:32.860]  the hurricane and dangerous summer storm season is here again. Every year, thousands of families
[3:06:32.860 --> 3:06:37.660]  lose their power from weather related outages. Number five, a solar power generator provides
[3:06:37.660 --> 3:06:42.300]  powerful backup insurance and peace of mind. Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators
[3:06:42.300 --> 3:06:46.860]  offered by Solutions from Science, a long time sponsor of ours. You can get more information

[3:08:21.420 --> 3:08:27.820]  Alex Jones. Well, joining us from the United Kingdom are Prima,
[3:08:28.620 --> 3:08:31.820]  Labo, Medical Doctor, Albert Enstoll by the Third General.
[3:08:33.340 --> 3:08:36.300]  Both of their bios are amazing. We've got 51 minutes with them. We're talking about the
[3:08:36.300 --> 3:08:41.020]  forced inoculation plans. Worldwide, level six, what's really in the triple jab,
[3:08:41.020 --> 3:08:46.780]  the right of self-shielding, what that means. The new developments with the U.S.
[3:08:46.780 --> 3:08:54.620]  head science czar, writing an internal government textbook, 1,100 pages on how to
[3:08:54.620 --> 3:08:59.740]  carry out a world government eugenics extermination plan. This is confirmation of everything we've
[3:08:59.740 --> 3:09:06.620]  reverse engineered. State Department of Moranum 200, United Nations Biological Diversity Assessment
[3:09:06.620 --> 3:09:14.220]  96. We have all the pieces. It's all stated, but this is all in one place and it's just
[3:09:14.220 --> 3:09:18.940]  devastating because even though I know all this stuff, you don't want to believe they're
[3:09:18.940 --> 3:09:23.180]  actually doing it. Forced drugging, forced sterilization, forced abortion, drugs in the
[3:09:23.180 --> 3:09:27.340]  water, the food, genetically engineered to sterilize mammals. It's coming up.
[3:09:27.340 --> 3:09:32.860]  Major General Albert Burt Stubblebine, the third U.S. Army retired, graduate of U.S.
[3:09:32.860 --> 3:09:37.500]  Military Academy West Point, class of 52, who enjoyed a distinguished 32-year career in U.S.
[3:09:37.500 --> 3:09:41.740]  Army during which he commanded soldiers at every level. After his retirement, he served as VP
[3:09:41.740 --> 3:09:47.100]  for intelligence systems with BDM, a major defense contractor. He's also taken a set of
[3:09:47.100 --> 3:09:52.460]  experiences and become involved in leading edge medical research and development,
[3:09:52.460 --> 3:09:59.100]  collaboration with his wife, Rima E. Labo, MD. He is a long-term, way out-of-the-box thinker who
[3:10:00.460 --> 3:10:04.780]  redesigned the U.S. Army's intelligence architecture while serving as the commanding
[3:10:04.780 --> 3:10:08.620]  general of the U.S. Army Intelligence School and Center and helped to define the requirements
[3:10:08.620 --> 3:10:14.220]  of the U.S. Army to future conflict and redesign and earned his place in the Intelligence Hall of
[3:10:14.220 --> 3:10:18.860]  Fame. Many of the innovations he developed helped U.S. conduct the first Gulf War effectively and
[3:10:18.860 --> 3:10:23.420]  swiftly with a very low casualty rate. He also commanded the U.S. Army Electronic Research
[3:10:23.420 --> 3:10:29.420]  and Development Command and the U.S. Army's Intelligence and Security Command. And it just
[3:10:29.420 --> 3:10:35.900]  goes on and on. So I guess general, then you'd be a major general when you retired?
[3:10:35.900 --> 3:10:40.940]  That is correct. Okay. We're going to go to you in a second, sir, and we appreciate you joining
[3:10:40.940 --> 3:10:46.620]  us on the interview today. Let's go to your wife, the medical doctor, first in light of,
[3:10:46.620 --> 3:10:49.500]  give us your perspective, and then I want to get the general's perspective,
[3:10:49.500 --> 3:10:55.260]  on the mass eugenics plan. We have right of self-defense. This is a government level,
[3:10:55.260 --> 3:11:01.980]  PhD textbook for government leaders for policy. I've now read over 400 pages of the 1100 total
[3:11:01.980 --> 3:11:07.420]  nightmare. Doctor, this is exactly what you've been saying for decades. Break down what this new
[3:11:07.420 --> 3:11:12.860]  development means. Then we'll get the general's take and then we'll expand out into what this
[3:11:12.860 --> 3:11:20.140]  flu vaccination means. I'm happy to do that, Alex. And I want you to know that both the general and
[3:11:20.140 --> 3:11:26.380]  I are happy and privileged to have the opportunity to talk to you and your listeners about this.
[3:11:26.380 --> 3:11:31.820]  This is a critical time. And the first thing I want to do is start at the very end. The very
[3:11:31.820 --> 3:11:42.940]  end is unless you listeners take action now, you will be faced with involuntary detention
[3:11:43.660 --> 3:11:52.460]  or mandatory vaccinations with an attenuated live virus vaccine containing deadly adjuvant,
[3:11:52.460 --> 3:11:59.500]  the same things that caused Gulf War syndrome in 700,000 soldiers. And you will have
[3:11:59.500 --> 3:12:06.060]  no recourse, no legal recourse, and you will have no financial recourse because vaccine
[3:12:06.060 --> 3:12:11.340]  makers are protected by the fraud and death administration and by the spineless, worthless
[3:12:11.340 --> 3:12:15.660]  Congress of the United States. And if you'd like later, Alex, I'll tell you how I feel about the
[3:12:15.660 --> 3:12:24.060]  Congress. Anyway, the point is that you have a moment now. If you go to our website, which is
[3:12:24.060 --> 3:12:38.140]  healthfreedomusa.org and you click on the top action item under act now, you will be telling
[3:12:38.140 --> 3:12:43.580]  Congress, your state legislators, the head of health and human services, the health of homeland
[3:12:43.580 --> 3:12:51.260]  security and the White House that you want the right to refuse vaccines, refuse incarceration,
[3:12:51.260 --> 3:12:59.820]  and instead retire to your home for the quarantine period and self-shield. Now,
[3:12:59.820 --> 3:13:06.300]  the best friend that health freedom has in the United States Congress is willing to take this
[3:13:06.300 --> 3:13:14.300]  onto the floor and create a bill and introduce the bill if there is enough support from all of us.
[3:13:14.300 --> 3:13:20.940]  So if ever you valued your freedom, if ever you valued your right to make your own health decisions
[3:13:20.940 --> 3:13:27.900]  and if ever you distrusted the government, now is the time. Go to healthfreedomusa.org
[3:13:27.900 --> 3:13:35.580]  and click on the top action item because if you don't, you will be either mandatory vaccinated
[3:13:35.580 --> 3:13:41.820]  or you will be incarcerated. And now to answer your question, Alex, because that's the bottom line,
[3:13:41.820 --> 3:13:51.420]  the answer is yes, the vaccine against this genetically engineered, weaponized H1N1 virus,
[3:13:52.060 --> 3:14:00.860]  which we are now being told, golly gee, willikers, this resembles the 1918 swine flu pandemic virus.
[3:14:00.860 --> 3:14:06.860]  Well, yes, of course it does because the genes were introduced intentionally into this new virus
[3:14:06.860 --> 3:14:15.180]  when they fizzled after being introduced into the avian flu virus. So now the vaccine will be a deadly
[3:14:15.180 --> 3:14:22.380]  quote remedy to get rid of a large number of us. And we're going, if we're sheeple, we're going to
[3:14:22.380 --> 3:14:28.700]  line up, roll up our sleeves, present our children for vaccination the way 40 million Americans did
[3:14:28.700 --> 3:14:39.900]  in 10 weeks during the swine flu debacle in 1976. Only this time they won't stop it after 10 weeks
[3:14:39.900 --> 3:14:47.500]  because the intention we firmly believe based on holder's document and on other information
[3:14:47.500 --> 3:14:53.260]  that we've been amassing for years and we've been talking about you and the general and I have had
[3:14:53.260 --> 3:14:58.140]  the chance to talk about it on this show and on others and we've been writing about it for years
[3:14:58.140 --> 3:15:07.180]  as you have this time. The intention is to get rid of us profitably. The amount of money that is
[3:15:07.180 --> 3:15:15.820]  being poured into the coffers of the world pharmaceutical companies is absolutely unholy
[3:15:15.820 --> 3:15:21.820]  as is the intent. In fact, today the World Health Organization put out, I'm sorry, yesterday,
[3:15:21.820 --> 3:15:28.940]  World Health Organization put out a press release saying that what we need for this
[3:15:28.940 --> 3:15:36.460]  and the coming pandemic, because remember, Alex, this vaccine is not the last pandemic
[3:15:36.460 --> 3:15:42.940]  vaccine. It's the first of many, many, many, many horrors to come until they've gotten rid of all
[3:15:42.940 --> 3:15:49.660]  of us. This is what's needed. We need many new vaccines. We need new patents. We need new drugs
[3:15:49.660 --> 3:15:54.620]  because if you look how they ramp it up, they admittedly are testing global level six with
[3:15:54.620 --> 3:16:00.460]  all the major nation states under the direction of the World Health Organization as global directorate
[3:16:00.460 --> 3:16:05.660]  and so it's kind of like a Jim Jones Kool-Aid drinking drill where they drill following orders
[3:16:05.660 --> 3:16:09.740]  and taking the poison and they admit, well, I mean, I mean, you've looked at this doctor and
[3:16:09.740 --> 3:16:15.180]  I want to get general stubble binds take on it. What is the history of these companies? We know
[3:16:15.180 --> 3:16:22.300]  that Baxter, I just put it on screen, London Telegraph, Baxter mixing the live bird flu
[3:16:22.300 --> 3:16:27.660]  in 18 countries secretly, then suddenly they have secret trials lying to homeless,
[3:16:27.660 --> 3:16:31.420]  but they won't say it's Baxter that did the trials and the homeless are dying in mass.
[3:16:31.420 --> 3:16:37.660]  Actually, I believe the trials were done by Novartis and I believe that they were in conjunction
[3:16:37.660 --> 3:16:44.140]  with Sanofi Aventis, the good people who manufactured an avian flu vaccine, which the
[3:16:44.140 --> 3:16:49.740]  United States bought a hundred million doses of in their first order, totally untested,
[3:16:49.740 --> 3:16:54.860]  untried, but approved by the FDA. Well, that's the thing. They're on our news here in Austin
[3:16:54.860 --> 3:16:59.740]  saying everybody's got to take the shot, get ready. They're on the news saying it will be mandatory
[3:16:59.740 --> 3:17:05.340]  coming up in the fall. It will be a pandemic. It will be mass death and then people are lining up
[3:17:05.340 --> 3:17:09.740]  and they're saying, oh, we don't even know if this is the right thing and just taking the shot.
[3:17:09.740 --> 3:17:15.740]  What do we know from past operations, Dr. Labo and then General Stubblebine about what they're
[3:17:15.740 --> 3:17:23.980]  putting in these vaccines? Well, they're putting adjuvants. Adjuvants are substances and the ones
[3:17:23.980 --> 3:17:29.980]  that we're most familiar with are the ones based on squalene, which is a fat ordinarily
[3:17:29.980 --> 3:17:35.260]  found in the nervous system. Now, when you eat squalene or you rub it on your skin and it's
[3:17:35.260 --> 3:17:41.020]  used in a lot of cosmetics, it doesn't do anything bad to you. But if you inject it,
[3:17:41.020 --> 3:17:48.460]  it trains the immune system's white cells to attack it because it's a foreign object in your
[3:17:48.460 --> 3:17:54.940]  bloodstream at that point and the immune system is only doing its job. It turns on the immune system
[3:17:54.940 --> 3:18:00.620]  and the immune system attack forces can never be turned off again. So they start attacking
[3:18:00.620 --> 3:18:06.300]  everything that looks biochemically like squalene. And then this, according to other
[3:18:06.300 --> 3:18:11.340]  doctors we've had on, accelerates the allergies, the sicknesses, the cancers, and then makes your
[3:18:11.340 --> 3:18:15.580]  immune system go, hey, I want to talk about that more. We're about to go to break. But General
[3:18:15.580 --> 3:18:21.020]  Stubblebine, you were just on six, seven months ago before this whole flu thing came up and you
[3:18:21.020 --> 3:18:26.700]  guys were talking about when they try to launch a pandemic, don't take the shot. What does this
[3:18:26.700 --> 3:18:34.220]  look like to you? Well, it's very clear, you know, what Dr. Riemann and I have been doing, Alex has
[3:18:34.220 --> 3:18:41.740]  been watching very carefully a whole lot of information. And I call them dots, they're
[3:18:41.740 --> 3:18:47.820]  tidbits of information, but it's part of the way I have been trained from the intelligence world
[3:18:47.820 --> 3:18:53.580]  or in the intelligence world of how you put the picture together. And what you do is you take
[3:18:53.580 --> 3:19:00.460]  little bits of information. For instance, 11 people died instantaneously in a trial in Poland,
[3:19:00.460 --> 3:19:09.980]  and then 22 more died later from the same vaccine that you're about to take. And then you take the
[3:19:09.980 --> 3:19:19.100]  information about Baxter, which contaminated the vaccines for 22 different countries or 18
[3:19:19.100 --> 3:19:25.180]  different countries in Europe. You put all of these various dots together like that,
[3:19:25.180 --> 3:19:30.380]  and what you end up with is a picture. Suddenly the picture flies into your face,
[3:19:30.380 --> 3:19:37.100]  and you say, holy smokes, now I take this to the people who are called operational folks,
[3:19:37.100 --> 3:19:43.420]  because they're the people that do the planning of what you do about it. So the intelligence
[3:19:43.420 --> 3:19:50.620]  piece of all of this has been creating this enormous picture that you now have seen the
[3:19:50.620 --> 3:19:55.820]  documentation for. Stay there. We've got to break. General, please come back with this,
[3:19:55.820 --> 3:20:00.220]  and we'll get the doctor's comments on this. Absolutely. We now have the full textbook and
[3:20:00.220 --> 3:20:04.700]  how they're going to kill us. Finally, in the news this evening, it's being reported that cyber
[3:20:04.700 --> 3:20:09.980]  spies from Russia and China have now penetrated our power grid. Even as energy experts are
[3:20:09.980 --> 3:20:14.540]  reporting that each summer we get closer and closer to the limits of our nation's power grid,
[3:20:14.540 --> 3:20:19.740]  some say that this summer's demand for electrical power may finally push the grid over its edge,
[3:20:19.740 --> 3:20:24.700]  creating a cascade of power outages across the country, putting us all in the dark.
[3:20:24.700 --> 3:20:30.460]  Are you prepared for the next round of storm-related outages or government-created blackouts? Have you
[3:20:30.460 --> 3:20:35.500]  ever thought about taking steps to get off the grid and generate your own private supply of
[3:20:35.500 --> 3:20:40.940]  electrical power? If so, this will be the most important information you have ever heard. Solar
[3:20:40.940 --> 3:20:45.900]  powered generators are finally available. They have no moving parts to wear out or break and
[3:20:45.900 --> 3:20:51.980]  require absolutely no gas whatsoever. Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to

[3:21:00.620 --> 3:21:07.500]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[3:21:07.500 --> 3:21:12.060]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful,
[3:21:12.060 --> 3:21:19.020]  just as strong, just as well funded. The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama
[3:21:19.020 --> 3:21:24.300]  is working for the best interests of the American people. While Obama's already fudging, fudged
[3:21:24.300 --> 3:21:29.100]  since day one in this election. If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of
[3:21:29.100 --> 3:21:36.380]  personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs,
[3:21:36.380 --> 3:21:41.900]  that's fascism. It's not about left or right. It's about a one-world government. This film
[3:21:41.900 --> 3:21:49.180]  documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda. Get your copy of the
[3:21:49.180 --> 3:21:56.380]  Obama deception today at infowars.com or download it in super high quality at prisonplanet.tv.
[3:21:56.380 --> 3:21:59.260]  The Obama deception. The people strike back.
[3:22:26.700 --> 3:22:30.860]  Companies too big to fail are now using the tax dollars to increase market share paying fat
[3:22:30.860 --> 3:22:34.700]  dividends. Are you wondering why supplies of gold and silver coins decreasing rapidly, leaving
[3:22:34.700 --> 3:22:39.340]  the public scrambling to accumulate what's left? The occurrences values based on trust, fiscal
[3:22:39.340 --> 3:22:43.420]  responsibility. Is Congress and the White House acting responsibly, earning your trust, or is
[3:22:43.420 --> 3:22:47.100]  it time to ensure your hard earned wealth? Midas Resources offers economic insurance,
[3:22:47.100 --> 3:22:52.700]  gold and silver coins, 800-686-2237. Do you believe that more bailout will solve our economic
[3:22:52.700 --> 3:23:01.020]  problems or would you like to call Midas Resources at 1-800-686-2237? That's Midas Resources at 1-800-686-2237.
[3:23:01.020 --> 3:23:06.540]  We are surrounded by harmful indoor air that can easily deliver many harmful toxins straight into

[3:24:25.500 --> 3:24:30.780]  Obama's science advisor called for planetary regime to enforce utilitarian population control,
[3:24:31.500 --> 3:24:38.780]  forced sterilization, forced abortion, euthanasia, forced drugging on the water supply and plantable
[3:24:38.780 --> 3:24:45.980]  chips. And this is Obama's science advisor, General Stubblebine, intelligence expert. Continuing,
[3:24:45.980 --> 3:24:49.820]  you got interrupted by the satellite break there, had to take it. Continuing with the
[3:24:49.820 --> 3:24:53.980]  intelligence, you're saying you can see the history of the vaccine, the history of what
[3:24:53.980 --> 3:24:58.940]  they've done over and over again, the fear mongering. And so it's not the flu you worry about,
[3:24:58.940 --> 3:25:04.380]  it's the shot. Continue. That's correct. Absolutely correct. And as you begin to,
[3:25:04.380 --> 3:25:11.420]  as this picture suddenly pops into your face, Alex, you suddenly say, holy smokes. You know,
[3:25:11.420 --> 3:25:17.980]  I knew it was bad. I did not know it was that bad. Now, though, it's time to take action because you
[3:25:17.980 --> 3:25:24.460]  now know. And oh, by the way, the book that you've just gotten is your confirmation that everything
[3:25:24.460 --> 3:25:29.420]  that we've been saying for months and months and months and months is absolutely true. And oh,
[3:25:29.420 --> 3:25:33.100]  by the way, during those months and months and months, people were saying we're crazy.
[3:25:34.860 --> 3:25:39.740]  We work for Big Pharma and we're CIA agents, yadda, yadda, yadda, yadda. The fact is they
[3:25:39.740 --> 3:25:45.820]  didn't want to hear what we were saying or they were on the other side. Ignore them. The facts
[3:25:45.820 --> 3:25:51.020]  are the facts. Yeah. Well, doctor, that's how COINTELPRO, that's how COINTELPRO works,
[3:25:51.020 --> 3:25:54.460]  is that they can't believe we have a Ron Paul. They can't believe we have a general stubble
[3:25:54.460 --> 3:25:59.980]  mind. They can't believe that there's good people from powerful positions that are stepping up.
[3:26:00.620 --> 3:26:06.220]  And that's what COINTELPRO does. But regardless, we're putting out the facts. We're doing the
[3:26:06.220 --> 3:26:11.100]  best we can. People can listen or they can go ahead and take the shots. No, but at this stage
[3:26:11.100 --> 3:26:16.060]  of the game, they better goddamn listen. Otherwise, excuse my language, but they better listen.
[3:26:16.060 --> 3:26:22.300]  Otherwise, they're going to be in deep trouble. You have now seen, for your, for a fact, I mean,
[3:26:22.300 --> 3:26:28.380]  you believed all along, Alex, now you understand exactly because you've seen the document.
[3:26:28.380 --> 3:26:35.500]  You've seen the blueprint for what all of this is about. Let me read to you the CDC assumptions
[3:26:35.500 --> 3:26:41.660]  that they're basing their targeting on. Okay. They say one, severity of illness is unchanged
[3:26:41.660 --> 3:26:45.740]  from that which has already been observed. Well, they're also predicting, I mean, this is just
[3:26:45.740 --> 3:26:50.940]  nonsense. They're also predicting that it's going to get a whole lot worse, which is why, after all,
[3:26:50.940 --> 3:26:56.540]  we need the vaccinations. They're saying for sure they know this, but with regular flu,
[3:26:56.540 --> 3:27:00.700]  they go a million Americans have it like we're all going to die. That just means we have the virus,
[3:27:00.700 --> 3:27:05.420]  no big deal. They're clearly engaged in lying and fair mongering. The question is why?
[3:27:06.300 --> 3:27:13.340]  Well, the answer is very simple because the WHO has said for decades and the United States
[3:27:13.340 --> 3:27:19.660]  government has accepted for decades that their first priority for a quote sustainable planet
[3:27:19.660 --> 3:27:26.060]  is the same as the Illuminati and Bilderberger agenda, which is massive depopulation. The Georgia
[3:27:26.060 --> 3:27:31.100]  Guidestones pretty well say it all. I don't know who put them up. I don't know what their deal was,
[3:27:31.100 --> 3:27:39.020]  but they do want to reduce the population by a minimum of 80% and a maximum of 90%. That means
[3:27:39.020 --> 3:27:46.460]  nine out of every 10 humans on the planet is slated to go. But as long as we're going, they say,
[3:27:46.460 --> 3:27:53.420]  why don't we just pump untold amounts of the remaining money such as it is the worthless
[3:27:53.420 --> 3:28:00.620]  money that's been degraded by the, if you will, the economic pandemic that's been engineered?
[3:28:00.620 --> 3:28:05.820]  Why don't we just pump all the remaining money into their hands through the diseases that they
[3:28:05.820 --> 3:28:12.140]  will cause and through the unbelievable amounts of money that these vaccines are generating?
[3:28:12.140 --> 3:28:15.420]  Well, Dr, we've got a long segment coming up. This was the short one. So we've got plenty of
[3:28:15.420 --> 3:28:18.780]  time for both you and General Stubblebine and to break this down to what you're recommending we do
[3:28:18.780 --> 3:28:23.100]  and how we get to the floor to say, look, we're not going to take forced injections
[3:28:23.100 --> 3:28:27.900]  because under the executive order that they've activated, as you know,
[3:28:27.900 --> 3:28:31.580]  the public may not. They're now saying forced inoculations under level six,
[3:28:31.580 --> 3:28:36.860]  quarantining, lockdown, basically code red. But General, briefly, a lot of the experts I talked
[3:28:36.860 --> 3:28:41.020]  to, but you've been the former head of major intelligence divisions of the army and really
[3:28:41.020 --> 3:28:46.380]  wrote the book on a lot of the systems we see today. Looking at this, most experts I talked to
[3:28:46.380 --> 3:28:50.300]  said they won't want to kill most people right away with the shot that it'll have a bad effect on
[3:28:50.300 --> 3:28:55.660]  some and the soft kill will be an immediate kill with some as we saw with trials in Poland and other
[3:28:55.660 --> 3:29:02.780]  areas. But a lot of experts are saying binary weapon for those that don't know, meaning this
[3:29:02.780 --> 3:29:07.260]  gives you half of it. They then trigger through water or air, something else later.
[3:29:08.460 --> 3:29:15.340]  You know, we know pieces of water in the vaccine. We absolutely do not know the entire menu that's
[3:29:15.340 --> 3:29:23.660]  in that vaccine. One thing is for sure, you can rest assured, since this vaccine is being put there
[3:29:24.780 --> 3:29:32.620]  on purpose to give you as an excuse to give you the shot, you know that what's going to be in
[3:29:32.620 --> 3:29:37.660]  there and what's going to be in your body is not going to fit in your body very nicely.
[3:29:37.660 --> 3:29:41.900]  Well, stay there. Stay there, doctor. We got a break. Long statement coming up. General,
[3:29:41.900 --> 3:29:47.340]  stay there. Absolutely. And a lot of experts we've talked to genetic engineers say a lot of these
[3:29:47.340 --> 3:29:54.540]  cancer viruses they implant trigger later. We're on the march. The empire's on the run.
[3:29:55.340 --> 3:30:03.660]  Alex Jones and the GCN radio network. This is Alex Jones. Have you heard of the millionaire

[3:33:19.420 --> 3:33:23.820]  Ladies and gentlemen this isn't a game or a joke that General Stubblebine was just saying.
[3:33:23.820 --> 3:33:34.780]  Okay we've got General Stubblebine and his wife. Dr. Remo Lebo you've got the floor here.
[3:33:35.340 --> 3:33:40.300]  Continue breaking down then because you got interrupted by some breaks. Start over, break down
[3:33:40.300 --> 3:33:45.500]  with the intelligence we have on these vaccines. What we know, I mean it's just like Gardasil
[3:33:45.500 --> 3:33:49.820]  at Middle East killing a whole bunch of women and girls having weird autoimmune diseases with the
[3:33:49.820 --> 3:33:55.500]  others. We're like almost like Ebola or bloods coming out of all these orifices. It's paralyzing
[3:33:55.500 --> 3:34:01.580]  people and it's like they're testing soft kills, testing the media's response, testing the public.
[3:34:01.580 --> 3:34:05.820]  I don't know what you'd call that general in a military fashion but just like before they
[3:34:05.820 --> 3:34:10.140]  invaded Panama they would have the helicopters land and do drills for six months to where they
[3:34:10.140 --> 3:34:16.380]  were acclimated. So they just acclimated us now to the ambient soft kill, silent weapons, quiet
[3:34:16.380 --> 3:34:21.580]  wars. Let's get the general's take on that and then the doctor breaking down what she sees happening
[3:34:21.580 --> 3:34:27.660]  here, how we get Congress to say no and it like override the executive order because they've now
[3:34:27.660 --> 3:34:33.180]  engaged level six. The question is will they implement. So General what do you call this
[3:34:33.180 --> 3:34:38.380]  soft kill system where they're increasing the deadliness of the vaccines, openly killing us,
[3:34:38.940 --> 3:34:43.340]  death to the left, death to the right and everyone just marching and injecting their children?
[3:34:43.340 --> 3:34:50.700]  Well I'm not I'm not sure that I know the the military terminology for this kind of soft kill
[3:34:50.700 --> 3:35:00.460]  but it's like guerrilla warfare because it's kind of behind the scenes, it's hidden. You know if
[3:35:00.460 --> 3:35:07.580]  you're doing guerrilla warfare you cannot go out into the middle of the of the street and with your
[3:35:07.580 --> 3:35:14.140]  gun you do it from an ambush position. So it's always hidden. Well there's not any difference
[3:35:14.140 --> 3:35:21.180]  between what is happening now and guerrilla warfare against our population. That's exactly what's
[3:35:21.180 --> 3:35:28.620]  happening Alex and go ahead. No you can just see him rolling out the total psi op for a non-event
[3:35:28.620 --> 3:35:34.300]  flu and then saying we're all basically dead in the fall, take the shot with their history
[3:35:34.300 --> 3:35:39.660]  of radiating foster children, black men and syphilis, Project Shad. How would anyone in their
[3:35:39.660 --> 3:35:45.340]  right mind take anything they try to give us? They're not in their right mind Alex. They've been
[3:35:45.340 --> 3:35:50.620]  propagandized, they've been fluoridated, they've been controlled. What percentage of the American
[3:35:50.620 --> 3:35:58.140]  population is on psychoactive medication and electroshock therapy? It's horrendously high
[3:35:58.140 --> 3:36:03.260]  and that means that people can be controlled. That's part of a soft kill and it's been going on for
[3:36:03.260 --> 3:36:10.140]  a long, long time. I want to remind people that the very first vaccine Edward Jenner's vaccine
[3:36:10.140 --> 3:36:19.020]  for smallpox was literally a vaccine for syphilis because it spread syphilis and by the mid 19th
[3:36:19.020 --> 3:36:26.540]  century the British Parliament which had made mandatory vaccination a law for every citizen
[3:36:26.540 --> 3:36:33.020]  and every resident of the British Empire discovered that they had created a syphilis epidemic.
[3:36:33.020 --> 3:36:39.020]  So they did an investigation, they held an inquiry and they discovered that they had two choices,
[3:36:39.020 --> 3:36:44.780]  choice one, admit it. They would have egg all over their faces and take responsibility for the fact
[3:36:44.780 --> 3:36:51.660]  that they had killed and named and sentenced to death millions of people through this hastily
[3:36:51.660 --> 3:36:58.300]  entered into scientific fraud which is what vaccination is or do a cover-up. They did a
[3:36:58.300 --> 3:37:04.460]  cover-up of course, they chose a cover-up and they doubled Edward Jenner's lifelong stipend from
[3:37:04.460 --> 3:37:12.300]  10,000 pounds. I think this was about 1853 to 20,000 pounds saying, oh there's nothing wrong here,
[3:37:12.300 --> 3:37:17.340]  look look we've done the right thing through self-defeat, fraud and lie.
[3:37:17.340 --> 3:37:22.220]  Wasn't that just a Malthusian first round of eugenics through Mr. Galton?
[3:37:22.220 --> 3:37:30.300]  No, I believe that in fact this was a colossal stupidity on the part of the British Parliament
[3:37:30.300 --> 3:37:37.020]  and that they chose to save their own egos and careers rather than back down from the position
[3:37:37.020 --> 3:37:43.500]  they had signed. Look at the 76 swine flu, this always breaks out the 1918 to 1976,
[3:37:43.500 --> 3:37:50.060]  it's always breaking out at military bases. Oddly enough where our soldiers are our guinea
[3:37:50.060 --> 3:37:59.180]  pig. Guess who gets to hold up their arm and or unclothe their arm and stand there and stick it
[3:37:59.180 --> 3:38:05.420]  out so that somebody will stick a needle in it and they have no choice. Same with vaccine A,
[3:38:05.420 --> 3:38:12.540]  I want to point out that the same information that Gary Matsumoto so beautifully brought forward
[3:38:12.540 --> 3:38:19.100]  in his vaccine A and the subtitle of that book was why the United States is
[3:38:19.100 --> 3:38:26.780]  experimenting on the military and why they won't be the last. He talked about squalene adjuvants.
[3:38:26.780 --> 3:38:33.740]  He talked about introducing oils that irritate the immune system so they make more antibodies.
[3:38:33.740 --> 3:38:40.060]  That means the expensive part of the vaccine, the antigen, can be in much much much smaller
[3:38:40.060 --> 3:38:47.180]  proportions so it's more profitable for the company and then you make more antigens. That
[3:38:47.180 --> 3:38:53.020]  means that you have a higher antigen tighter in your body. So it's that accelerant that triggers
[3:38:53.020 --> 3:38:58.140]  the autoimmune response you're saying. The other medical doctors we've had on have said
[3:38:58.140 --> 3:39:02.220]  that's the thing that causing a lot of the autism, not even the mercury, is that it causes
[3:39:02.220 --> 3:39:06.860]  that brain swelling that then causes brain damage. Correctly, but there's another part to this.
[3:39:06.860 --> 3:39:13.020]  No one, and I say this as a scientist and as a physician, no one has ever proven
[3:39:13.020 --> 3:39:20.380]  in any clinical trial whatsoever that that high titer, that high level of antibodies,
[3:39:20.380 --> 3:39:27.900]  is related in any way with immunity to the disease ever. So this whole thing is pointless.
[3:39:27.900 --> 3:39:33.180]  It's quackery. It's quackery. Total quackery. Okay, doctor and general, from a military
[3:39:33.180 --> 3:39:35.900]  perspective, intelligence perspective, from a medical doctor perspective,
[3:39:37.180 --> 3:39:41.660]  you've got all these deaths all over Europe and Asia in swine flu and bird flu trials.
[3:39:41.660 --> 3:39:45.900]  You know, high death rates where they inject 100 people in it, you know, a whole bunch of them
[3:39:45.900 --> 3:39:49.660]  dropped dead and we've been putting mainstream news articles on screen. And then the media is
[3:39:49.660 --> 3:39:54.220]  very quiet. The government even indicts people who gave the shots saying they were paid by
[3:39:54.220 --> 3:39:59.500]  pharmaceutical companies, but then we can't ever find who they are. And then we've got Baxter
[3:39:59.500 --> 3:40:03.980]  involved in the new vaccine that they're involved in. I mean, what does this look like to you?
[3:40:03.980 --> 3:40:08.620]  And then, and then how are you coming out and saying, look out with this next flu shot that's
[3:40:08.620 --> 3:40:15.820]  coming out? Let me know. Let me hit that first. Okay, general. I'll tell you what, it looks like
[3:40:15.820 --> 3:40:26.380]  an ambush. You know, if you're in a city or a town and you're going door to door in fighting,
[3:40:26.940 --> 3:40:31.580]  you never know where the ambush is going to come from. Is it going to come from a roof,
[3:40:31.580 --> 3:40:40.460]  from a window, from a door, from behind the door? You don't know. And this whole thing, Alex, is,
[3:40:40.460 --> 3:40:49.900]  to me, looks exactly like that door to door fighting in towns called ambush, ambush. That's
[3:40:49.900 --> 3:40:56.380]  what it is. But this time the ambush is by our own forces against our own people. Well, we can see
[3:40:56.380 --> 3:41:00.940]  that the whole thing's engineered. We can see it's all hype and the vaccine's deadly and they admit
[3:41:00.940 --> 3:41:05.820]  won't even protect you from it and normally flues mutated into something less harmful or harmless.
[3:41:05.820 --> 3:41:10.700]  How are they saying 100% it's going to mutate deadly in the fall? Now, we're not saying that's
[3:41:10.700 --> 3:41:14.220]  going to happen. They're saying it. I mean, for anybody with a scientific background doctor in
[3:41:14.220 --> 3:41:20.700]  general, it's 101 that they can't say they know it's going to be deadly. That clearly is a lie,
[3:41:20.700 --> 3:41:24.700]  so it means that they know something we don't know. Are they going to release something else?
[3:41:25.260 --> 3:41:29.500]  It's a lie unless they know something that has never been told to the public.
[3:41:29.500 --> 3:41:37.340]  Well, now I want to avoid giving these media too much credit. SARS fizzled. Athean flu fizzled.
[3:41:37.900 --> 3:41:47.340]  The pandemic swine flu fizzled. They may or may not be able to get the next generation
[3:41:47.340 --> 3:41:54.220]  of this virus, this genetically engineered virus, to do what they want, which has killed lots of
[3:41:54.220 --> 3:41:58.940]  us. But it doesn't matter because they've got the vaccine, which is much more direct,
[3:41:58.940 --> 3:42:02.780]  much more effective. Now, listen up, folks. Which is the ambush.
[3:42:02.780 --> 3:42:08.140]  Which is the ambush. It's a single person. And by the way, let me reiterate. I was starting
[3:42:08.140 --> 3:42:16.540]  to read this before. The first target is children from kindergarten to 12th grade. The second target
[3:42:16.540 --> 3:42:26.940]  is pregnant women. The third target is adults between 45 and 65. That's the most productive
[3:42:26.940 --> 3:42:32.540]  segment of the workforce. These are the people who are going to receive the vaccines and there
[3:42:32.540 --> 3:42:38.220]  are many of them. Just to back you up for putting it on screen, doctor. She's not just saying this.
[3:42:38.220 --> 3:42:43.660]  The news is announced. Children first, then the elderly, then the sick. These are the most vulnerable
[3:42:43.660 --> 3:42:50.060]  and they admit. The second group is pregnant women. Now, I want to just add one more thing,
[3:42:50.060 --> 3:42:58.860]  Alex, because there's so much to say and time is so short. If Gardasil does what I believe
[3:42:58.860 --> 3:43:06.380]  Gardasil does and serve a vaccine, which is the British equivalent of Gardasil, which is about
[3:43:06.380 --> 3:43:12.620]  to be also approved in the United States shortly. If these two vaccines do what I believe, which
[3:43:12.620 --> 3:43:21.580]  is render girls infertile, there's no reason to believe, oh yes, there's no reason to believe
[3:43:21.580 --> 3:43:31.180]  that this new vaccine, for which Baxter applied for the patent in 2007, by the way. So this surprise
[3:43:31.180 --> 3:43:37.820]  rush to get things on the street, so to speak, is total hype and nonsense because they've been
[3:43:37.820 --> 3:43:45.100]  preparing this since 2007. If it does the same thing and it contains one of the same ingredients
[3:43:45.100 --> 3:43:53.420]  between TWEEN80, which is very similar to polysorbate 80, and both of them injected
[3:43:53.420 --> 3:44:00.460]  cause infertility, then what we have is not only death, but an end of whatever race you happen
[3:44:00.460 --> 3:44:06.220]  to belong to. Let me stop you, doctor. My gut from all these hundreds of pieces that the general
[3:44:06.220 --> 3:44:11.100]  talks about is sterilization because that's in the State Department of Moranum 200, that's in the
[3:44:11.100 --> 3:44:18.460]  White House, Czar's internal textbook plan report, and we know where the tetanus shots in Africa,
[3:44:18.460 --> 3:44:22.220]  Asia, and India, they got caught in the mid-90s, mainstream news for those that don't know, I
[3:44:22.220 --> 3:44:27.660]  know you know, adding a hormone to the tetanus shot to then cause an autoimmune response to that
[3:44:27.660 --> 3:44:32.140]  hormone and then basically sterilize women by abortion, where every time they have it, you
[3:44:32.140 --> 3:44:39.020]  get pregnant, the baby dies second trimester from that hormone. And by the way, that same system,
[3:44:39.020 --> 3:44:46.700]  which was created by the World Health Organization through its task force on female sterilization
[3:44:46.700 --> 3:44:55.660]  through inoculation, that same substance is available as, quote, a one-year birth control shot
[3:44:55.660 --> 3:44:59.580]  for women and girls in the United States. Just thought I'd throw that in.
[3:44:59.580 --> 3:45:06.700]  Well, I've seen U.S. programs and TV ads where they tell girls get your tetanus shot.
[3:45:06.700 --> 3:45:11.340]  It's obvious. I mean, doctor, I want you to keep breaking down the math and the science and the
[3:45:11.340 --> 3:45:17.740]  facts and the key pins and paper ready, the websites for folks so people can get involved
[3:45:17.740 --> 3:45:22.140]  with Congress saying, now we're not going to quarantine, we're not taking your shots,
[3:45:22.140 --> 3:45:26.940]  let us stay in our homes, don't make the army drag us off. But general, speaking to the military,
[3:45:26.940 --> 3:45:33.340]  the police, back in 2002 with the Model States Health Emergency Powers Act, you know they ordered
[3:45:33.340 --> 3:45:38.220]  first responders to take it. And the news reported LA Times over 99% said no. So the military and
[3:45:38.220 --> 3:45:42.220]  police aren't stupid. They even had bases saying no, even though they were ordering them to.
[3:45:42.220 --> 3:45:47.260]  But the firemen, the police, the doctors, Tommy Thompson said no, health and human services
[3:45:47.260 --> 3:45:53.180]  had what I mean, the basic psychology. This attacks all of us. It's a very tiny eugenicist
[3:45:53.180 --> 3:45:58.940]  elite doing this. So we need to get the message out to the enforcers too. Why would they want to
[3:45:58.940 --> 3:46:05.980]  serve this evil? I mean, can you comment to this phenomenon of the very people being killed by this
[3:46:05.980 --> 3:46:12.540]  are the very ones that are going to be enforcing it? A lot of that is simply because
[3:46:13.660 --> 3:46:20.620]  once you enter into the military, you know, the answer is yes, sir, yes, sir, no, sir, yes, sir.
[3:46:20.620 --> 3:46:29.020]  And everybody does exactly what they're told to do. So if the people at the very, very top know,
[3:46:29.020 --> 3:46:35.980]  but the people at the lower levels do not know what's really going on, they're there to take
[3:46:35.980 --> 3:46:45.260]  orders. And it's very, very hard to sort of wake yourself up when you're in the middle of this,
[3:46:45.260 --> 3:46:51.660]  yes, sir, no, sir, I will do it, sir, kind of environment. So it's very, very difficult to
[3:46:52.380 --> 3:46:58.460]  also then go to the internet, go to the who it's not in the papers. So where do they get
[3:46:58.460 --> 3:47:05.100]  their information? They've got to wake up all by almost all by themselves. They very difficult
[3:47:05.100 --> 3:47:10.060]  thing to do. And the people who are putting out the information, Alex, and there's a small community
[3:47:10.060 --> 3:47:16.700]  of us are attacked by this Cointel pro nonsense. And then people who want to do the right thing,
[3:47:16.700 --> 3:47:21.180]  who want to inform themselves say, well, I better stay away from him. I better stay away from her.
[3:47:21.180 --> 3:47:24.460]  I better stay away from that. That's done to destroy our community. The last thing the
[3:47:24.460 --> 3:47:29.100]  new order would do would be to have you guys out putting out nothing but accurate info
[3:47:29.100 --> 3:47:34.300]  and warning people they would have you out saying it wasn't true. And again, they do this to
[3:47:34.300 --> 3:47:40.140]  balkanizes. They do this to break up our base. I have a 2004 Army manual that's declassified on
[3:47:40.140 --> 3:47:47.260]  how to do this to indigenous groups. Exactly. Now, I want to, I want to give you the action step.
[3:47:47.260 --> 3:47:53.260]  And if you don't take this, and if you don't viralize it, and this is the helpful side of
[3:47:53.260 --> 3:47:59.260]  viralization, viral spread of the info. Yeah. Yes. If you don't do this, then when they come at you
[3:47:59.260 --> 3:48:08.140]  with a vaccine needle and your children and they say, okay, either bear your arm or go into detention,
[3:48:08.140 --> 3:48:18.300]  remember that you had the choice and you didn't take it. I want you to go to www.healthfreedomusa.org.
[3:48:18.300 --> 3:48:25.100]  On the right hand side, it says act now. Click on the first button. Tell legislators you want the
[3:48:25.100 --> 3:48:32.700]  right self quarantine, not forced vaccinations and not forced incarceration. Take that. Every
[3:48:32.700 --> 3:48:38.940]  member of your family gets to send in one of those, those action items. If your kids are too young,
[3:48:38.940 --> 3:48:44.220]  fill in their names. That's legitimate. What's happening is that Congress is getting bombarded
[3:48:44.220 --> 3:48:49.340]  with hundreds of thousands of these. And so is every state legislator in the country. But we need
[3:48:49.340 --> 3:48:56.620]  millions, not hundreds of thousands. And what this is saying is, oh, no, you don't. This is pushback
[3:48:56.620 --> 3:49:03.980]  because remember, a lot of state legislators and a lot of congressmen don't have the information you
[3:49:03.980 --> 3:49:09.500]  do. So instead of arguing with them about vaccines are good, vaccines are bad, the WHO is the new
[3:49:09.500 --> 3:49:16.700]  world order. Forget that. What we're saying is I want a third pass. Pass one, take the shot. Pass
[3:49:16.700 --> 3:49:23.580]  two, accept incarceration in state or federal facilities. Pass three, I go into my house,
[3:49:23.580 --> 3:49:29.420]  I shut the door, I stay there. And yeah, the kids might get bored. Get them some extra books. The
[3:49:29.420 --> 3:49:33.340]  point is- Well, the last place you want to go during any time, you're a medical doctor,
[3:49:33.340 --> 3:49:37.340]  you get the general's take on this. The last place you want to go during a pandemic is some big
[3:49:37.340 --> 3:49:45.660]  mass camp. Absolutely. Absolutely want to stay out of them. Now let me take you back to the videos
[3:49:45.660 --> 3:49:54.060]  of the 500,000, which is only a small part, the 500,000 three-person disposable caskets
[3:49:54.620 --> 3:49:59.980]  that are stockpiled outside of Atlanta. And we know that there's- Alabama, Georgia, Texas,
[3:49:59.980 --> 3:50:05.980]  Colorado, they're everywhere. Right now, I let me take you back to the mass grave sites, which have
[3:50:05.980 --> 3:50:12.620]  been purchased and are being prepared in upstate New York and in virtually every- No, we got the
[3:50:12.620 --> 3:50:18.140]  official state documents telling the cemeteries, don't tell anybody, can you bury 200,000 people
[3:50:18.140 --> 3:50:23.100]  on your little plot? We have the documents. And you won't even get your own coffin. And now ask
[3:50:23.100 --> 3:50:29.580]  yourself, what's that for? Is that when I die from the vaccine? Is that when I die from the
[3:50:29.580 --> 3:50:36.620]  secondary soft kill? Because a lot of these vaccines are being produced on simian cells that we know
[3:50:36.620 --> 3:50:42.860]  contain leukemia viruses. Is that what you want? Well, just like Sv 40, they admitted had cancer
[3:50:42.860 --> 3:50:47.500]  viruses and over 100 million Americans got it. This is unbelievable. General Stubblebind's our
[3:50:47.500 --> 3:50:54.140]  guest, Dr. Lebo's our guest. This is just blowing me away. And they're openly announcing mass graves,
[3:50:54.140 --> 3:50:58.460]  martial law. It doesn't mean it's going to happen. This could just be a beta test, but we got to
[3:50:58.460 --> 3:51:07.820]  take it very, very serious. If you owe the IRS, you can't make the problem go away without

[3:52:02.300 --> 3:52:07.580]  It is a big idea. A new world order. In the near future,
[3:52:08.300 --> 3:52:13.260]  Earth is dominated by a powerful world government. It's known as the Builder Bird.
[3:52:14.300 --> 3:52:19.580]  Both their objectives be world domination. For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[3:52:19.580 --> 3:52:25.660]  Now, as they hail the birth of the new world order, their great dream of exterminating 80%
[3:52:25.660 --> 3:52:33.900]  of humanity is at hand. For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government
[3:52:33.900 --> 3:52:39.020]  is blown wide open. You will learn the secret that drives the entire new world order agenda.
[3:52:39.020 --> 3:52:43.100]  Builder Bird is making great progress toward a world government. Most people have no idea.
[3:52:43.100 --> 3:52:46.460]  They're not after money. They have all the money they need. They're after power. That's their

[3:53:05.500 --> 3:53:10.140]  The revolutionary Berkey light, self-sterilizing and recleanable purification elements purify
[3:53:10.140 --> 3:53:15.420]  water by removing pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites to non-detectable levels and by
[3:53:15.420 --> 3:53:21.580]  extracting harmful chemicals such as herbicides, pesticides, VOCs, organic solvents, radon-222,
[3:53:21.580 --> 3:53:26.380]  and trihalomethane. They also reduce nitrates, nitrites, sediment, and unhealthy minerals
[3:53:26.380 --> 3:53:30.540]  such as lead and mercury. As an authorized dealer for over four years serving thousands

[3:54:08.300 --> 3:54:11.500]  I'm going to do 10 minutes of overdrive. I just decided to do it.
[3:54:11.500 --> 3:54:17.660]  It'll be at www.prisonplanet.tv, video stream, and infowars.com, audio streams only.
[3:54:17.660 --> 3:54:22.060]  We'll see if General Stubblebine and Dr. Lebo can stay 10 minutes into the next hour.
[3:54:22.060 --> 3:54:25.100]  I've got a meeting I've got to go to after that so I couldn't do it any longer, but I'll just
[3:54:25.100 --> 3:54:27.740]  I'll ask him on air right now. Can you guys do 10 minutes into the next hour?
[3:54:28.300 --> 3:54:31.100]  For the sake of getting truth out, you got it.
[3:54:31.100 --> 3:54:32.780]  You bet your bottom dollar.
[3:54:33.580 --> 3:54:34.140]  Awesome, sir.
[3:54:34.140 --> 3:54:37.820]  I want to share something with you that just came into my email box, Alex.
[3:54:37.820 --> 3:54:49.260]  It seems that there is a health reform bill, a healthcare bill, which will fund state vaccine
[3:54:49.260 --> 3:54:57.980]  teams to conduct interventions, quote, quote, in private homes. Now, this bill says that it will
[3:54:59.580 --> 3:55:06.700]  allow, quote, authorizes a demonstration program to improve immunization coverage under the program.
[3:55:06.700 --> 3:55:12.060]  CDC will provide grants to states to improve immunization coverage of children, adolescents,
[3:55:12.060 --> 3:55:16.060]  and adults through the use of evidence-based interventions.
[3:55:16.060 --> 3:55:20.300]  Yes, here's the article. They're not going to send CPS to adult and children's homes.
[3:55:20.300 --> 3:55:24.780]  Cyber news service, very credible. They have links to the documents. Zoom in on this.
[3:55:24.780 --> 3:55:29.500]  This ties into the FEMA camp bill. Zoom in on this for folks. I meant to get to this.
[3:55:29.500 --> 3:55:34.300]  This is the type of news I have stacked up. This is up on infowars.com right now.
[3:55:34.300 --> 3:55:41.180]  Now, healthcare bill will fund state vaccine teams to conduct interventions in private homes.
[3:55:41.180 --> 3:55:45.260]  So they're now preparing to make everything mandatory, just like Rick Perry saying,
[3:55:45.260 --> 3:55:50.620]  it's the law. You've got to take Gardasil when it killed a bunch of girls and women in the trials
[3:55:50.620 --> 3:55:53.900]  and is still killing people. General Stubblebine in plain view,
[3:55:54.460 --> 3:55:57.020]  they're now making people take things that kill them.
[3:55:57.020 --> 3:56:04.860]  Yeah. Well, the answer, that's yes. And look at all of the soldiers who step up in the line
[3:56:04.860 --> 3:56:09.420]  and say, yeah, shoot me. You know, shoot me with a shot or shoot me with a shotgun.
[3:56:09.420 --> 3:56:15.180]  And once again, get caught, Marshall, but they don't. I'm going to say it again, Alex. Listen,
[3:56:15.180 --> 3:56:22.620]  folks, get a pen, get a pencil. If you're on the internet right now, type in to the address bar,
[3:56:22.620 --> 3:56:39.500]  www.healthfreedomusa.org. You'll see act now. Click on the first item to tell people who can make
[3:56:39.500 --> 3:56:45.980]  the difference, who can respond to your pushback that you want the right to go into your home
[3:56:45.980 --> 3:56:52.140]  without being molested or violated by goons, government goons bearing vaccines.
[3:56:52.140 --> 3:56:57.180]  Well, I mean, that's why they've been GPS and everybody's doors. And they've now admitted
[3:56:57.180 --> 3:57:03.100]  it's for the quarantines. I mean, they really, general, isn't this just the perfect cover,
[3:57:03.100 --> 3:57:08.780]  even if they don't want your bio attack? Absolutely. Yes, for martial law and federalization.
[3:57:08.780 --> 3:57:15.580]  Absolutely. They find incidentally, I had forgotten for a moment the fact that they know
[3:57:15.580 --> 3:57:23.020]  where every door is, where every family lives, so they can go to that door. If you've decided
[3:57:23.020 --> 3:57:28.700]  not to take a shot, they can go knock on your door and say, well, now just give me your arm here.
[3:57:29.980 --> 3:57:35.900]  Let me explain that they have targeted children first. Let me also remind you,
[3:57:36.620 --> 3:57:43.500]  and you may be one of the people who actually had this happen, that the CDC has been calling the
[3:57:43.500 --> 3:57:47.900]  people. The CDC is a unit of the Health and Human Services. Yeah, we confirm that,
[3:57:47.900 --> 3:57:51.180]  asking if their vaccines are up to date. I'm getting all these calls from listeners,
[3:57:51.180 --> 3:57:57.100]  and I Googled it and I saw a news article where they are calling. It's actually happening. Stay
[3:57:57.100 --> 3:58:01.420]  there. We're talking about, we go into overdrive. It's a one minute break, general and doctor.
[3:58:01.420 --> 3:58:04.780]  One minute break as we end the main radio show and then internet only,
[3:58:04.780 --> 3:58:09.660]  prisonplanet.tv viewers will be able to see it and all the tens of thousands listening right now
[3:58:09.660 --> 3:58:15.900]  on the internet streams at infowars.com. But when this video gets posted as an archive
[3:58:15.900 --> 3:58:20.380]  at prisonplanet.tv later in the day, not just the live stream, everybody get it out everywhere,
[3:58:20.380 --> 3:58:27.500]  because it's worse than I even consciously know as they mention other issues. I know it's all true,
[3:58:27.500 --> 3:58:33.820]  and just more pieces come in. This is Eugenics, the White House chief admits it in his book,
[3:58:33.820 --> 3:58:40.380]  EcoScience. They are killing us. This is real. Stay with us back in 60 Seconds at infowars.com.
[3:58:43.580 --> 3:58:48.540]  Thank you for listening to GCN. Be sure to visit GCNLive.com today.
[3:58:51.100 --> 3:58:55.500]  This is Alex Jones, and I want to tell you again about a company that has supported us in the
[3:58:55.500 --> 3:59:00.780]  Truth Movement for years. Inner Health Botanicals. This company produces the highest quality superfood
[3:59:00.780 --> 3:59:06.700]  around, called Inner Food. My wife just loves the stuff, and now the health ranger Mike Adams has
[3:59:06.700 --> 3:59:12.860]  awarded Inner Food his Editors Choice Award, or Best Superfood of 2009. Inner Food is loaded
[3:59:12.860 --> 3:59:18.220]  with 20 great organic ingredients. No fillers, no sweeteners. It would be impossible to blend this
[3:59:18.220 --> 3:59:23.100]  up for a better price, and their formula really works. This is the real thing for the great
[3:59:23.100 --> 3:59:28.620]  health you need. Try the Nutra Cafe. They're great organic coffee infused with polysaccharides
[3:59:28.620 --> 3:59:33.420]  that boost the immune system. A truly healthy coffee that tastes great. And take it from me,
[3:59:33.420 --> 3:59:37.260]  folks. It really does taste great. Don't forget to try their other great products.
[3:59:37.260 --> 3:59:49.660]  Go to www.enerfod.com. That's www.enerfod.com, or just click on their banner on infowars.com
[3:59:49.660 --> 3:59:59.260]  for special pricing. This is the GCN Radio Network. Owned a hard hitting talk radio.
[4:00:20.300 --> 4:00:30.860]  They want you dead, ladies and gentlemen, as the White Houses are over science states,
[4:00:30.860 --> 4:00:35.100]  and wrote a textbook. How to do it? You read that textbook is exactly what they're doing.
[4:00:35.740 --> 4:00:42.460]  We got Major General Retired Stubblebind. We have his accomplished wife, Dr. Rima Lebo,
[4:00:42.460 --> 4:00:46.380]  who's even treated heads of state. Who openly talk about, yeah, it is the plan to kill everybody.
[4:00:46.380 --> 4:00:49.500]  This is serious business.
[4:00:49.500 --> 4:00:55.580]  This is serious business, and I want to make a point. There is an internet petition going around,
[4:00:55.580 --> 4:01:00.620]  which has all the right moves, so to speak. It says really good things. I agree with everything
[4:01:00.620 --> 4:01:06.700]  it says. It's completely useless. We have contacted the people who put it out, and we said, look,
[4:01:06.700 --> 4:01:12.700]  this has no political meaning. And right now, the only solution that's going to keep us from
[4:01:12.700 --> 4:01:19.980]  these damn needles killing us now or slowly is a political solution. We need a political solution.
[4:01:19.980 --> 4:01:23.660]  We need to make a stink, too, and let people know they don't have to take these shots. But we just
[4:01:24.220 --> 4:01:27.740]  get to that in a moment. In the few minutes we have left here, though, and I want to give out
[4:01:27.740 --> 4:01:32.940]  the website and the letter and the phone numbers that you want people to call and specifics for
[4:01:32.940 --> 4:01:37.340]  what you want them to tell Congress when they call. But we just ended the last hour with General
[4:01:37.340 --> 4:01:42.860]  Stubblebine and yourself talking about how it is in the news. The CDC is calling and saying,
[4:01:42.860 --> 4:01:47.980]  have you had your shots when there's no law to take them? So they're using the pandemic
[4:01:47.980 --> 4:01:52.540]  fear over this one flu, and it says they're, it's actually in the news. They're asking,
[4:01:52.540 --> 4:01:59.020]  has your daughter had her genital wart shot? Have you had your chickenpox shot? And then now they
[4:01:59.020 --> 4:02:04.940]  say they're going to go to your door. I mean, this is worse than the Soviet Union or Nazi Germany.
[4:02:04.940 --> 4:02:09.500]  General Stubblebine, your take on this. Well, they're very, very simple. They're,
[4:02:10.940 --> 4:02:17.580]  you know, let me back off for one second. In every strategy, in every kind of military
[4:02:17.580 --> 4:02:23.020]  operation, you have a primary attack, you have secondary attacks. Right now, the primary attack
[4:02:23.020 --> 4:02:29.100]  looks to be like the vaccine. All of these other pieces are the secondary attacks or the
[4:02:29.100 --> 4:02:34.060]  preparations for the main attack. The main attack is coming. There's, let there be no
[4:02:34.060 --> 4:02:40.540]  doubt about it. And they have gone around and they have literally from satellites have taken
[4:02:40.540 --> 4:02:44.220]  pictures of your front door. So they know where you are. They know your phone number, you know
[4:02:44.220 --> 4:02:49.180]  their name. And now they're asking the questions of, Oh, by the way, are you up to date on all your
[4:02:49.180 --> 4:02:54.860]  shots? Why would they do that? Unless they had somebody who was going to come to your door
[4:02:54.860 --> 4:02:59.580]  and give you a shot. No, they're saying it in the bill. And again, months ago, we're saying,
[4:02:59.580 --> 4:03:04.620]  Hey, they're getting GPS for shots. Now they're calling saying we got your GPS and they're saying
[4:03:04.620 --> 4:03:09.900]  we're going to lock down cities and it's going to be on your ID card, on your database, whether
[4:03:09.900 --> 4:03:14.940]  or not you've had the shots. I mean, this is on, and they've got all these TV shows general
[4:03:14.940 --> 4:03:20.380]  with, with this preparatory phase of there's going to be a pandemic. Do what the military says.
[4:03:20.380 --> 4:03:24.700]  I mean, they're really drilling the public consciousness. And you're saying, you're saying,
[4:03:24.700 --> 4:03:28.940]  looking at the pieces, general, you think they're getting ready to really red light things.
[4:03:28.940 --> 4:03:32.860]  And I mean, I mean, green light things and that this is the real deal.
[4:03:35.420 --> 4:03:39.420]  We want to make it a red light. And that's what pushback does, Alex.
[4:03:39.820 --> 4:03:46.060]  And let me tell you what, let's, let's talk to principles of war. One of the principles of war
[4:03:46.060 --> 4:03:54.940]  and one of the most important principles of war is called math. You need to put together the largest
[4:03:54.940 --> 4:04:01.660]  force that you can be that totally overwhelms the other side. Right now, they have got the math.
[4:04:01.660 --> 4:04:07.900]  We have got the math in people, but they have been silent. They have now got to get up on their
[4:04:07.900 --> 4:04:15.100]  high legs and make noise. All of them, all of the people in this station have got to get there.
[4:04:15.100 --> 4:04:24.540]  I think the action that Dr. Rima talked about before, www.AlfreedomUSA.org and go to the action
[4:04:24.540 --> 4:04:31.740]  and now call them on the right hand side and make sure that your voices, all of your voices,
[4:04:31.740 --> 4:04:38.220]  are heard in Congress and in the state and the federal level and in all of the agencies.
[4:04:38.220 --> 4:04:42.220]  You want to do that. Not one person listening to your show, Alex,
[4:04:42.220 --> 4:04:49.660]  should be unaware of the fact that both state and federal statutes say that if you don't accept
[4:04:49.660 --> 4:04:57.500]  the mandatory vaccine in time of pandemic, you will be involuntarily quarantined and incarcerated.
[4:04:57.500 --> 4:05:03.260]  Yes, that's the official executive order and the statutes. Right now, they can drag you in your
[4:05:03.260 --> 4:05:07.900]  family away, put whatever they want in your body. Folks, this is tyranny. They've got a history of
[4:05:07.900 --> 4:05:14.460]  eugenics. The White House chief is a eugenicist calling for sterilization and deaths. General
[4:05:14.460 --> 4:05:21.340]  Stubblebine, I'll say it. Do we not as free, sentient beings have a right to self-defense
[4:05:21.340 --> 4:05:25.100]  against aggression? I don't care what bull crap law they say they've got.
[4:05:25.740 --> 4:05:32.140]  The best self-defense is the voice. All of the voices, all of the voices, everyone
[4:05:32.140 --> 4:05:38.060]  are about to be standing on their hind legs yelling and they need to go to the website, they need to
[4:05:38.060 --> 4:05:42.860]  take the action and they need to make sure that all of their friends and their friends, friends,
[4:05:42.860 --> 4:05:49.900]  friends and their friends, friends, friends, friends do the same because the one thing Alex
[4:05:49.900 --> 4:05:58.140]  is through mass and it's called action by every single American who does not want to die.
[4:05:58.140 --> 4:06:06.860]  Sun Tzu said, Sun Tzu said that the best way to win a war is without fighting the battle.
[4:06:06.860 --> 4:06:13.660]  Now, this is a hard dude and he was not afraid of military action, but he understood that the
[4:06:13.660 --> 4:06:23.660]  ultimate purpose of a war, if it's as people fight it, is to secure eventual peace and prosperity.
[4:06:23.660 --> 4:06:28.300]  Now, for the generals and the globalists, it's a whole different matter, but what people want is
[4:06:28.300 --> 4:06:34.460]  peace and prosperity and if we accept these vaccines, we will have neither peace nor prosperity.
[4:06:34.460 --> 4:06:40.300]  If we push back, yeah, they'll be back again next time, but so will we.
[4:06:40.300 --> 4:06:45.660]  I was about to say, look at 2002, 2003, they tried to make their first responders take the
[4:06:45.660 --> 4:06:50.940]  inoculations as an act of supplication and submission and their own enforcers who were
[4:06:50.940 --> 4:06:55.820]  going to supposedly be running the force injection drills on us and they've had these drills publicly,
[4:06:55.820 --> 4:07:02.220]  they won't even take it. But let them have this fake victory of scaring everybody with the flu,
[4:07:02.220 --> 4:07:06.780]  then it kind of blows over. They give people a soft kill weapon, kills them a decade later.
[4:07:06.780 --> 4:07:11.660]  That's never psychologically attached to the event of the vaccine. And then next time they say,
[4:07:11.660 --> 4:07:17.820]  take the shot, people are more compliant. We've got to build our mass, our force, to say no to this
[4:07:17.820 --> 4:07:23.020]  and they're using the psi op of this fear mongering to try to set the president to do this.
[4:07:23.020 --> 4:07:28.300]  We have to grow our muscles and our mass and our force each time in this fight. Do you agree
[4:07:28.300 --> 4:07:35.020]  with that statement, General? Absolutely, absolutely, 100%. And every voice needs to be not just that
[4:07:35.020 --> 4:07:42.460]  voice, but every single person that they know to get their voice is going to because mass wins.
[4:07:42.460 --> 4:07:49.660]  Let's call it freedom's multiplier. If you sign this demand and it's not a request, Alex, it's a
[4:07:49.660 --> 4:07:55.820]  demand for the right to control what happens to your body and your children's body. And you don't
[4:07:55.820 --> 4:08:03.340]  get 10 people or 100 people to do the same you have failed in your duty as a free human being.
[4:08:03.340 --> 4:08:08.540]  Absolutely. And call another talk shows and say, I want you to have General Stubblebine and Dr.
[4:08:08.540 --> 4:08:13.660]  Lebow on. I want you to have other people on to talk about this. Get a huge buzz going as well.
[4:08:13.660 --> 4:08:17.580]  That's another area of the info war. These letters to the criminals as good as well.
[4:08:18.380 --> 4:08:23.660]  But this is part of the domestication, part of the process of training us to take their soft kill
[4:08:23.660 --> 4:08:27.740]  weapons. General Stubblebine, as this develops, let me have both of you back up in the near
[4:08:27.740 --> 4:08:34.140]  future as we go into the fall. You too, Dr. Lebow and Godspeed in the work you're doing on all these
[4:08:34.140 --> 4:08:38.780]  other fronts with the Codex Alimentarius. Let's not wait five or six months before we have you back
[4:08:38.780 --> 4:08:47.100]  on again. Let me close in one other friend's food quote. There comes a time in any battle
[4:08:47.100 --> 4:08:55.980]  when both sides are defeated. The side that persists at that time is the winner. It's time for our
[4:08:55.980 --> 4:09:05.980]  voices to continue to make noise so that we are heard in mass. Thank you. Absolutely. Dr. Lebow,
[4:09:05.980 --> 4:09:09.580]  General Stubblebine, God bless you. We'll talk to you again soon. Keep up the good work. Thanks,
[4:09:09.580 --> 4:09:15.500]  Alex. You're judging by their fruits. I only see good fruits from these people. I've seen no
[4:09:15.500 --> 4:09:18.540]  evidence when people try to demonize them and attack them. But regardless, let's not get this
[4:09:18.540 --> 4:09:22.860]  diverted by is Alex Jones good or bad? Or is General Stubblebine good or bad? Is Ron Paul
[4:09:22.860 --> 4:09:27.180]  good or bad? You know the Newell Order has signed executive orders and are saying they're getting
[4:09:27.180 --> 4:09:31.020]  ready to forcibly inject you. I can show you a newscast for newscast and we have. You've heard
[4:09:31.020 --> 4:09:36.220]  it. You've seen it. That's the issue. Face the issue at hand. Horse inoculations. You want to
[4:09:36.220 --> 4:09:40.220]  call me an agent because I'm saying you shouldn't have to take force inoculations. Go ahead. That's
[4:09:40.220 --> 4:09:45.420]  going to tell Pro. Be weak minded if you want. I got a few points I want to make in the next five
[4:09:45.420 --> 4:09:51.180]  minutes and then we are going to end this transmission for today. But first off, I want
[4:09:51.180 --> 4:09:56.060]  people to look at this again. Look at this article again and look at it carefully. This is key.
[4:09:58.140 --> 4:10:01.900]  I want everybody to go to infoworks.com. I know
[4:10:03.580 --> 4:10:06.620]  I know that Curtin and Paul Watson are doing stories on this. They need to tie it into the
[4:10:06.620 --> 4:10:11.020]  GPS and the people getting phone calls about inoculations and the rest of it. Healthcare
[4:10:11.020 --> 4:10:16.380]  bill will fund state vaccine teams to conduct interventions in private homes.
[4:10:16.380 --> 4:10:21.900]  CNS news. Very credible. There is a knock at the front door peeking through the window. A mother
[4:10:21.900 --> 4:10:26.380]  sees a man with a woman both in uniform. Now I was getting calls about this in the last month.
[4:10:26.380 --> 4:10:34.220]  This is now already happening. They are agents of healthcare reform. Excuse me, man says the man.
[4:10:34.220 --> 4:10:38.300]  People have been describing this. They're even wearing like fake police uniforms. They're like
[4:10:38.300 --> 4:10:42.860]  blue that looked like a police uniform. God help us. The eugenics teams are on the street.
[4:10:42.860 --> 4:10:48.540]  Excuse me, man says the man. Our record show you are 11-year-old daughter has not been immunized with
[4:10:48.540 --> 4:10:54.860]  general warts, which is the soft kill Gardasil. Your four-year-old still needs a chicken box
[4:10:54.860 --> 4:10:59.340]  vaccine, says the woman. He will not be able to start kindergarten unless he gets the shot.
[4:10:59.340 --> 4:11:05.980]  You know, says the man, smiling from ear to ear. It just goes over. Folks, this is now going on.
[4:11:08.140 --> 4:11:11.500]  My God. They're talking about how it's a bill and the bill summary says they're going to do that.
[4:11:11.500 --> 4:11:17.740]  This is already being done with the CDC federally. I mean, this is total hell. Imagine if the Nazis
[4:11:17.740 --> 4:11:21.900]  would have come around. Oh, there's a flu scare. Everybody take your shot. Oh, people would have
[4:11:21.900 --> 4:11:27.180]  willingly done it. See, this is more sophisticated. The eugenics has got beaten back 60 years ago.
[4:11:27.180 --> 4:11:35.580]  Now they're here with a vengeance, operating covertly. Okay. I want to go over these notes I've
[4:11:35.580 --> 4:11:42.620]  got here. But I also want to ask listeners to go to prisonplanet.com and get this article and get
[4:11:42.620 --> 4:11:48.460]  it out to everybody. This is of the greatest import that this be done.
[4:11:51.740 --> 4:11:56.540]  Obama's science advisor called for planetary regime and forced utilitarian population control
[4:11:56.540 --> 4:12:00.060]  measures. Folks, this has the documents, the book. You got to read this. Now, these are some
[4:12:00.060 --> 4:12:03.980]  notes I wrote this morning. I promised I was going to cover these on air. I meant to spend hours
[4:12:03.980 --> 4:12:08.140]  elaborating on each, but I'm just going to go over this. These points I wrote slowly so you
[4:12:08.140 --> 4:12:14.460]  know my philosophy and where I stand and where I hope people will stand with me on. We live
[4:12:16.220 --> 4:12:22.220]  a wonderful life on a wonderful planet full of wonders and full of just so many great things
[4:12:22.220 --> 4:12:26.300]  and so much goodness. And we've got to admit the evil in the world and fight the evil in the world
[4:12:26.300 --> 4:12:30.860]  to protect the good and stop saying, Hey, man, just be positive. We are positive. That's why
[4:12:30.860 --> 4:12:39.020]  we're fighting. The only way to be in control is to kill. It is not easy to do good. It is easy
[4:12:39.020 --> 4:12:43.180]  to do evil. See, it's hard to control an outcome if you're trying to build and nurture and give
[4:12:43.180 --> 4:12:48.620]  people freedom, but it's easy if you're the dark new water chiefs to engage in evil and extermination
[4:12:48.620 --> 4:12:55.500]  and control because they don't care who they hurt. Just remember that they are the priests of power
[4:12:55.500 --> 4:12:59.580]  who love to press on the nerve of power, who love to grind humanity into submission, who love to
[4:12:59.580 --> 4:13:06.620]  engage in horrible tyrannies. We must resist them. So step up to the plate as I said in that rant
[4:13:06.620 --> 4:13:13.420]  in the first hour, which we're about to cut back to in a moment. Look what we've turned into torture,
[4:13:13.420 --> 4:13:16.620]  tortures that people's children in front of their parents now admitted mainstream news.
[4:13:16.620 --> 4:13:22.220]  I told you seven years ago, now it's mainstream news hit teams, banks robbing us and stealing.
[4:13:22.220 --> 4:13:31.180]  We're going into bondage to the elite who think of us as total scum. To my attackers,
[4:13:31.180 --> 4:13:34.860]  many of which are not co until pro and are not government, but pick up on co until pro
[4:13:36.460 --> 4:13:40.140]  who believe it's fashionable to attack me because I'm the most prominent voice in the
[4:13:40.140 --> 4:13:43.820]  fight against the globalist. My God, I can't believe I'm the most prominent. Anybody in the
[4:13:43.820 --> 4:13:49.100]  world, maybe Ron Paul or me, but I'm the more hardcore on some of the issues he won't get into.
[4:13:49.100 --> 4:13:52.380]  As he said to the cameras, well, I haven't gotten to the nine 11 as I'm too busy.
[4:13:53.340 --> 4:13:59.500]  We understand, but the, but the issue is to those that attack me just because of jealousy
[4:13:59.500 --> 4:14:03.180]  or whatever jealous of what that I was up here at one o'clock in the morning, last night,
[4:14:03.180 --> 4:14:07.740]  jealous because I'm fighting hard, be leaders. Don't destroy yourselves. I want you to be
[4:14:07.740 --> 4:14:11.580]  right beside us and right in front of us and right behind us in this fight. And I know I'm
[4:14:11.580 --> 4:14:16.620]  good and I know I'm for real. And it's just sad to see you not being your own person to see you
[4:14:16.620 --> 4:14:21.980]  obsessed with me. And in a way, you know, it helps me become more famous and better known,
[4:14:21.980 --> 4:14:27.100]  but that's not what I want. I want us all to be leaders and to affect change, but in a negative
[4:14:27.100 --> 4:14:31.260]  sick worldly system, you're actually helping Alex Jones when you lie about me and attack
[4:14:31.260 --> 4:14:35.980]  me and spread my name. So in a way, I guess God just blesses us and people find out who I really
[4:14:35.980 --> 4:14:41.820]  am and find out the truth. So it's just hurtful because I know I'm for real and I know 99% of
[4:14:41.820 --> 4:14:46.860]  what's said about me is a liar or a distortion. And a lot of you aren't government operatives. You
[4:14:46.860 --> 4:14:54.140]  just are very worldly and been twisted and I feel sorry for you. And I want you to be your own
[4:14:54.140 --> 4:15:03.500]  person and not be played. Be your own man and woman. A message to the feds, the contractors,
[4:15:03.500 --> 4:15:08.380]  the ideologues, those of you that are on the wrong side of history against those of us that love
[4:15:08.380 --> 4:15:16.060]  liberty and freedom. This system hates you and abuses you and is destroying your future as well.
[4:15:16.060 --> 4:15:20.060]  And I know they're hitting you with soft kill weapons and sterilization weapons. And it's just
[4:15:20.060 --> 4:15:24.940]  a fact and you may like to feel like you're the winner and con yourself and decide to serve the
[4:15:24.940 --> 4:15:30.460]  system and laugh at us and decide you're in control. Bless your soul. You're not in control.
[4:15:31.020 --> 4:15:35.900]  The only way you're in control is of your own soul deciding to do right. You can make that
[4:15:35.900 --> 4:15:41.740]  decision, but the rest of it's in God's hands. And so I ask you to make that decision to do right
[4:15:41.740 --> 4:15:45.900]  and to really, if you've got any soul left, any humanity left to realize what you've been part
[4:15:45.900 --> 4:15:51.820]  of and stand up against the new world order. So don't be part of the wrong side of history.
[4:15:56.540 --> 4:16:00.700]  You know, many of us are born into these different tribal groups and religious groups and are
[4:16:00.700 --> 4:16:06.540]  controlled. And we were sold out before we were even born. There's still time to turn back and
[4:16:06.540 --> 4:16:13.660]  wake up and commit to standing up against tyranny and just getting out of your programming, realizing
[4:16:13.660 --> 4:16:17.900]  there's a bigger system around you that people are trying to manipulate you, that there are
[4:16:17.900 --> 4:16:23.260]  covert and overt agendas. I also just want to say I love life and creation and everything good and
[4:16:23.260 --> 4:16:27.900]  wholesome. I want to say that and that I've been very appreciative and thankful for life
[4:16:27.900 --> 4:16:32.300]  and that I know that good can win the day when it decides to stand up and take action.
[4:16:33.340 --> 4:16:37.340]  And I believe that that love of innocence and that love of creativity and that sense of
[4:16:37.340 --> 4:16:40.700]  wonderment is the keys to the universe and the soul and heart of God.
[4:16:43.420 --> 4:16:47.980]  Don't ever let them break your spirit. It doesn't matter how much I got attacked,
[4:16:47.980 --> 4:16:52.540]  how much I get lined about, how much people twist and distort. I know I'm real. I know I'm good.
[4:16:52.540 --> 4:16:56.460]  I know I'm telling the truth. And that's what matters. And you should have that same attitude
[4:16:56.460 --> 4:17:00.780]  and just move forward against the globalists, warn the people you can. When you get laughed at,
[4:17:00.780 --> 4:17:05.180]  move on. It doesn't matter. It's sad. Stop caring what people think about you.
[4:17:09.980 --> 4:17:14.540]  Evil hides behind good, but the proof is always in the fruits. So look at that,
[4:17:14.540 --> 4:17:21.340]  realize how the enemy camouflages themselves. The elite are compartmentalized, specialized,
[4:17:21.340 --> 4:17:25.740]  and compartmentalized into different sectors of evil. Many of them don't see the big picture.
[4:17:25.740 --> 4:17:29.580]  So as you show people the big picture and discuss the greater truths,
[4:17:29.580 --> 4:17:36.220]  you're going to unlock many of the evil people out there who've been caught up in this and not
[4:17:36.220 --> 4:17:41.500]  realize what they were part of and many of them can come out of it. And many people laugh at you
[4:17:41.500 --> 4:17:47.580]  upfront, but as what you've warned them about comes true down the road, they will wake up.
[4:17:47.580 --> 4:17:51.660]  So it's a delayed event. Don't expect to see instant success when you're reaching out to
[4:17:51.660 --> 4:17:58.060]  people just like fighting the Federal Reserve. Look how far we've now come. We are in the midst
[4:17:58.060 --> 4:18:02.780]  of the greatest transformation in human history for good and bad with the technological developments,
[4:18:02.780 --> 4:18:07.580]  the acceleration of knowledge, the acceleration of weapons systems, the decadence, the goodness,
[4:18:07.580 --> 4:18:11.260]  the good, the bad, and the ugly. Just realize you're part of an incredible time in history.
[4:18:11.260 --> 4:18:15.500]  Stop watching the sports, the sitcoms, the stuff that doesn't matter. Get tuned into reality.
[4:18:15.500 --> 4:18:24.300]  And leave your mark. Communicate with the future. Do things good for society and humanity.
[4:18:24.300 --> 4:18:29.180]  Find out the truth and love humanity and realize you're part of something bigger.
[4:18:30.300 --> 4:18:36.300]  Realize that we are our ancestors and we are our future progeny and that we're all one species.
[4:18:36.300 --> 4:18:41.260]  We're individuals, but we're also part of a greater tapestry. And in that, you certainly never die
[4:18:41.260 --> 4:18:46.220]  unless the species is irrevocably damaged by the criminal predators that are running the system.
[4:18:47.500 --> 4:18:54.380]  And again, leave the species better off than when you came to it. That really is
[4:18:54.380 --> 4:18:58.140]  the whole sum of it. I want to say great job to the crew. We're going to go to retransmission now
[4:18:58.140 --> 4:19:03.260]  with a key rant I was doing in the first hour. I thought was very informative, a lot of key info.
[4:19:03.260 --> 4:19:07.660]  So that's coming up. Great job, crew. And as always, thank you for all your prayers. I'm praying
[4:19:07.660 --> 4:19:12.540]  for all of you freedom lovers and people that love decency and creativity and honor and innocence.
[4:19:13.420 --> 4:19:17.980]  I'm here with you. You're with me. We're together in history together in this moment in forever.
[4:19:18.780 --> 4:19:25.580]  And I'll see you back live Monday, Burmese is sitting in tomorrow. And on Sunday, I'm Alex Jones,
[4:19:25.580 --> 4:19:41.500]  signing off. God bless you all.
