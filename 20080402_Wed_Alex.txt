[01:00.600 --> 01:04.720]  Ventura it's an honor to have you on governor hi Alex great to be here and
[01:04.720 --> 01:08.840]  hi to everybody in Austin Texas you know I got down there when kinky was
[01:08.840 --> 01:12.200]  running for governor and it's a beautiful part of Texas where you're at
[01:12.200 --> 01:16.080]  yes sir well we're on in Austin Texas and San Diego and Kansas City a lot of
[01:16.080 --> 01:18.960]  other places and it's it's a great to have you on with us we hope you'll come
[01:18.960 --> 01:23.560]  back and visit kinky and Willie and a lot of others in the near future sir
[01:23.560 --> 01:27.280]  there's a lot to talk about in this short segment we've got what do you think
[01:27.280 --> 01:30.880]  is most important about this book I don't just say this when I have guests on
[01:30.880 --> 01:36.120]  I couldn't put this book down it's amazing well thank you you know I I wrote
[01:36.120 --> 01:40.480]  the book I now live in Mexico for half the year and I got together with Dick
[01:40.480 --> 01:44.000]  Russell a friend of mine down there was a writer and we put this book together
[01:44.000 --> 01:48.840]  but I think the main thing that I want to stress and get across to people is
[01:48.840 --> 01:53.320]  that we do need a revolution in this country and when I say revolution that
[01:53.320 --> 01:57.080]  doesn't mean it has to be violent you know typically people think that you
[01:57.080 --> 02:01.240]  know like overthrowing the government of Cuba when Castro and Che Guevara did
[02:01.240 --> 02:05.760]  that with violence but we could have a revolution without violence and it's
[02:05.760 --> 02:11.560]  high time for it Alex because I mean my god the Democrats and Republicans we are
[02:11.560 --> 02:17.320]  now nine trillion dollars in debt that is the national debt and if they if they
[02:17.320 --> 02:22.360]  behave that way in the private sector they'd be jailed and put in prison you
[02:22.360 --> 02:27.600]  know like Enron and WorldCom and yet our media and all our pundits put them up
[02:27.600 --> 02:32.400]  on pedestals they call them honorable and the whole thing in our history books
[02:32.400 --> 02:35.600]  will say how great they are and they're selling our country out from right under
[02:35.600 --> 02:40.040]  our feet and that's why you say don't start the revolution without me and I
[02:40.040 --> 02:44.040]  agree the most successful revolutions really aren't violent look at the
[02:44.040 --> 02:49.280]  Renaissance itself was a revolution of ideas and the printing press and free
[02:49.280 --> 02:55.000]  market I see what we need to develop as something similar to the Renaissance a
[02:55.000 --> 02:59.240]  rediscovery of liberty and freedom and what Ron Paul has said legalizing
[02:59.240 --> 03:04.840]  freedom exactly you know Ron Paul was a very interesting candidate in the in
[03:04.840 --> 03:09.840]  the presidential race that the media really kind of pushed him off and didn't
[03:09.840 --> 03:14.160]  listen to what he had to say and that's the sad part about it because I
[03:14.160 --> 03:19.720]  found it very interesting when Buto was killed over in Pakistan and all of the
[03:19.720 --> 03:24.400]  all of the candidates went on with this big litany of what the United States
[03:24.400 --> 03:28.680]  should be doing and this and that whatever and it got to Ron Paul and he
[03:28.680 --> 03:32.400]  said something to me that was the best answer he simply said isn't that
[03:32.400 --> 03:39.800]  Pakistan's business absolutely well you know Ron Paul is still out there on the
[03:39.800 --> 03:42.960]  campaign trail I mean he's admitting he's not going to win but he's there to
[03:42.960 --> 03:47.640]  inject real issues into the debate that's why I wish you'd run Jesse Ventura
[03:47.640 --> 03:52.240]  I wish you'd run right now so we could at least inject real issues well you
[03:52.240 --> 03:57.800]  know it was interesting I did Larry King last night and Larry started at the
[03:57.800 --> 04:01.840]  start of the show and asked a asked a question he said how many people think
[04:01.840 --> 04:06.900]  Jesse Ventura should run for president and I was astounded by the end of the
[04:06.900 --> 04:12.160]  show it just floored me I thought maybe if I got 50 or 60 percent I'd be doing
[04:12.160 --> 04:18.320]  good it was 85 percent Alex it was just mind-boggling oh there's incredible
[04:18.320 --> 04:23.120]  disenfranchisement with the major two parties as you know I mean look at
[04:23.120 --> 04:27.680]  Congress with depending on the poll on 11 to 20 percent approval rating both
[04:27.680 --> 04:32.120]  parties are hated now well and they should be as I said they've put us so far
[04:32.120 --> 04:37.920]  in debt I can't even fathom what nine trillion dollars is can you know I can't
[04:37.920 --> 04:43.280]  Jesse the mind Ventura will be back in about two minutes on the other side of
[04:43.280 --> 04:49.080]  this quick break right here on the one the only GCN radio network

[08:04.040 --> 08:09.240]  which one to call him by but we'll just go with governor Ventura Jesse to mind
[08:09.240 --> 08:16.960]  Ventura with us for the rest of the hour this book is titled don't start the
[08:16.960 --> 08:20.560]  revolution without me I think it's a wonderful title and it's in stores
[08:20.560 --> 08:24.920]  everywhere today it's he's just launching his a tour yesterday we're
[08:24.920 --> 08:30.960]  honored to having but you could also call it the the adventures of Jesse
[08:30.960 --> 08:35.120]  Ventura because it is quite a page-turner because you've had quite a
[08:35.120 --> 08:42.240]  quite a full life why did you decide to write this particular style of book
[08:42.240 --> 08:47.160]  well first of all you know Alex I want to explain you know I had two New York
[08:47.160 --> 08:52.160]  Times bestsellers before this book and of course they gave me huge front money
[08:52.160 --> 08:55.560]  to write that book and it was interesting I'll give you a little
[08:55.560 --> 09:00.720]  inside info this book we wrote it down in Mexico we brought the full transcript
[09:00.720 --> 09:07.640]  back to Russell and I we were turned down by 24 publishers and I already had
[09:07.640 --> 09:12.640]  two New York Times bestsellers I found that pretty interesting you know are
[09:12.640 --> 09:15.600]  you breaking that here because I haven't I did quite a bit of research for this
[09:15.600 --> 09:20.080]  interview and I hadn't seen that got my what out there no I mean is this the
[09:20.080 --> 09:25.640]  first time you've told this story yeah wow yeah absolutely well I mean please we
[09:25.640 --> 09:29.840]  got turned down by 24 and finally Sky Horse which is a small publishing
[09:29.840 --> 09:33.760]  company in New York picked it up but the good thing is we're with Norton
[09:33.760 --> 09:38.040]  distribution which is a huge distributor and that's the key is once you get
[09:38.040 --> 09:41.080]  published and you need to get it to a good distributor and they're one of the
[09:41.080 --> 09:45.760]  biggest so it'll be everywhere but you know I wrote this book I didn't take
[09:45.760 --> 09:49.840]  any big front money because I truly wanted this book out there I didn't
[09:49.840 --> 09:54.240]  care about the money on this book I wanted to tell my story I wanted to tell
[09:54.240 --> 09:58.280]  about the things that happened I was when I was in office because Alex I don't
[09:58.280 --> 10:04.080]  know if you certainly you read the book so you know this MSNBC in essence
[10:04.080 --> 10:09.560]  censured me because when I came out of office I was the hottest commodity out
[10:09.560 --> 10:14.640]  there I was the voice of the independent to CNN wanted me MSNBC wanted me Fox
[10:14.640 --> 10:20.280]  News wanted me I signed with MSNBC and then essentially they wouldn't even
[10:20.280 --> 10:25.080]  put me on the air and my contract stated that I couldn't do any news shows or I
[10:25.080 --> 10:30.920]  couldn't do any cable or satellite and so I believe I was silenced on purpose
[10:30.920 --> 10:36.160]  let's stop right there governor Ventura this is all amazing bombshells that
[10:36.160 --> 10:41.080]  you're dropping on us first you've had two super New York Times bestsellers
[10:41.080 --> 10:47.880]  right you you've been the dark horse candidate of the people in Minnesota you
[10:47.880 --> 10:51.520]  spurred Schwarzenegger to run and caused that whole phenomenon and he's
[10:51.520 --> 10:55.080]  basically admitted it seeing you have success he went for it you have this
[10:55.080 --> 11:00.880]  amazing history Hollywood star and you went to 20 plus publishers and they
[11:00.880 --> 11:05.800]  said no and you went to a new publisher that just fired up what in 2007
[11:05.800 --> 11:09.320]  according to what I was reading on their site I mean that is a story of
[11:09.320 --> 11:14.040]  censorship alone and their fear of your message but now we're learning and yes
[11:14.040 --> 11:17.880]  you do mention the book and of course get into it but there's so much in the
[11:17.880 --> 11:23.760]  book I'd forgotten about that that that that MSNBC literally muzzled you and
[11:23.760 --> 11:29.120]  use that contract to block you from going anywhere else exactly they wouldn't
[11:29.120 --> 11:33.520]  put me on the air and the reason for it was because I was opposed to the Iraq
[11:33.520 --> 11:38.640]  War before it started if you think back you remember when Phil Donahue had that
[11:38.640 --> 11:44.480]  short-lived show on MSNBC they kicked him off yeah well Phil was the highest
[11:44.480 --> 11:50.160]  rated show they had have you ever Alex heard of a network pulling its highest
[11:50.160 --> 11:56.040]  rated show it's suicide well you don't do that and yet they did it you know they
[11:56.040 --> 12:01.160]  pulled Phil and then they wouldn't allow me on and it was because Phil and I
[12:01.160 --> 12:05.880]  were both questioning the reasons why are we going into Iraq if you believe
[12:05.880 --> 12:10.880]  9-11 and what they told us there wasn't one Iraqi even involved in it Iraq did
[12:10.880 --> 12:16.480]  nothing to us well that's right there are still some neocon followers of what
[12:16.480 --> 12:20.960]  I call fake conservative news shows that still believe Saddam was the one behind
[12:20.960 --> 12:25.080]  the attack when Bush and Cheney admit he had nothing to do with it and actually
[12:25.080 --> 12:29.960]  fought against the Wahhabis based in Saudi Arabia known as al-Qaeda well I
[12:29.960 --> 12:33.720]  don't know if you can ever get that Cheney to admit that George Bush but I
[12:33.720 --> 12:38.760]  know that you know that they still like to refer back and try to tie the two
[12:38.760 --> 12:42.680]  together all the time somehow there are a few clips where they've had to admit it
[12:42.680 --> 12:46.640]  one time Cheney was on the Russerton had to admit it no okay you know you
[12:46.640 --> 12:50.200]  probably watch more than I do because I'm living in Mexico now and you know
[12:50.200 --> 12:54.120]  that's another subject that's interesting Alex you know this whole this whole
[12:54.120 --> 13:00.120]  situation with immigration I mean I live down with all these brown skin people
[13:00.120 --> 13:04.200]  down there and I don't know about you and where you stand on it but I don't
[13:04.200 --> 13:08.960]  believe the United States needs to be East Berlin well we have a Larry King
[13:08.960 --> 13:16.000]  clip John you've got that clip don't you okay well we're gonna play that coming
[13:16.000 --> 13:19.720]  up in a little while but last night you said hey Lou Dobbs what are you so
[13:19.720 --> 13:23.800]  afraid of I live down you know in the middle of nowhere in Mexico and these
[13:23.800 --> 13:27.640]  brown skinned people are pretty nice they're very nice I'll tell you I have
[13:27.640 --> 13:31.800]  the time of my life down there and Alex I live an hour from pavement and an hour
[13:31.800 --> 13:39.000]  from electricity tell us about where you live well but trust me I do have
[13:39.000 --> 13:43.240]  electricity my house is completely solar I'm off the grid and I live off the sun
[13:43.240 --> 13:47.360]  no but I mean I want to image your house and you're in my mind what's it look
[13:47.360 --> 13:51.160]  like where's where is it beautiful well well I don't want to get you too close
[13:51.160 --> 13:54.160]  because I don't worry I'm not gonna come down there I'm just saying I can
[13:54.160 --> 13:58.400]  picture you in this little jungle bungalow off the beach well trust me it's
[13:58.400 --> 14:02.800]  not quite a jungle bungalow it's three bedrooms three and a half baths with the
[14:02.800 --> 14:07.040]  casita in the back a two-and-a-half car garage my own swimming pool and 40 of my
[14:07.040 --> 14:12.080]  own palm trees sounds awesome and so you just right so what you just go out and
[14:12.080 --> 14:16.200]  scuba dive and surf hold it but I by saying with the surfers we've got a
[14:16.200 --> 14:20.800]  whole group of ex-patriots down their surfers who they work up in the United
[14:20.800 --> 14:24.080]  States for six months and they save their money and then they go down and
[14:24.080 --> 14:27.480]  live in the arroyos on little campsites and surf all the time and
[14:27.480 --> 14:34.200]  they're marvelous people no no I'm believe me every day I dream about moving
[14:34.200 --> 14:37.920]  off to some tropical paradise so you've certainly are certainly living the life
[14:37.920 --> 14:41.960]  what and so you're just coming back to the US I guess because you're so sick of
[14:41.960 --> 14:47.160]  seeing and turn into a police state well I come back every year I should make
[14:47.160 --> 14:51.080]  mention I live there six months and then if you've ever been to Minnesota I
[14:51.080 --> 14:56.280]  wouldn't wish a Minnesota winter on my worst enemy because they're brutal and
[14:56.280 --> 15:00.640]  after living there my whole life so I really live as the leaves are if the
[15:00.640 --> 15:06.160]  leaves are out I'm in Minnesota if the leaves are gone I'm in Mexico well this
[15:06.160 --> 15:10.120]  network I'm based in awesome with the network Genesis Network is based in
[15:10.120 --> 15:13.280]  Minneapolis St. Paul in a little area called Burnsville I'm sure you know it
[15:13.280 --> 15:17.160]  and what well so Minneapolis and I've been up there let me tell you for a
[15:17.160 --> 15:20.320]  Texas boy I can't handle it when you breathe and it feels like your teeth
[15:20.320 --> 15:24.240]  are gonna fall out oh it's it's it believe me you don't even have to be a
[15:24.240 --> 15:30.000]  Texas boy you're a Minnesota boy now you get the same reaction let's let's go
[15:30.000 --> 15:35.000]  back to your first day as governor you've just shocked the whole country you
[15:35.000 --> 15:40.400]  know coming from nowhere in the polls to you know winning handily as the first
[15:40.400 --> 15:43.800]  you major independent governor I guess there've been one more before you in
[15:43.800 --> 15:49.640]  Minnesota history you come into office and you tell the story of 20 plus CIA
[15:49.640 --> 15:55.240]  agents in your office well actually the accurate part of this is I was the
[15:55.240 --> 16:00.000]  second independent governor let's give credit to go yes Angus King of Maine
[16:00.000 --> 16:05.840]  Angus served one term ahead of me and did two terms in Maine he was on his
[16:05.840 --> 16:10.400]  second term when I was doing my first he just didn't get all the publicity that
[16:10.400 --> 16:14.960]  I got but Angus were approved invaluable to me because he had been there four
[16:14.960 --> 16:18.600]  years already and done that and whenever we'd go to the National
[16:18.600 --> 16:23.160]  Governors Convention on the second day out in Washington all the Republican
[16:23.160 --> 16:27.480]  governors would meet in this building all the Democratic governors would meet
[16:27.480 --> 16:31.240]  in this other building and Angus and I would take a walk on Constitutional
[16:31.240 --> 16:36.880]  down on the park bench and have the independent governor's meeting but
[16:36.880 --> 16:42.200]  anyway the CIA story did not happen on my first day it was about three weeks
[16:42.200 --> 16:47.200]  into it and I got this request we'll call it with quotes around it to the
[16:47.200 --> 16:52.680]  bottles of the Capitol basically to be interrogated by 23 members of the CIA
[16:52.680 --> 16:58.160]  of which you know of course they tried to say I was lying about it but the CIA
[16:58.160 --> 17:02.640]  came out and admitted that it did happen in fact I have MPR did an
[17:02.640 --> 17:08.000]  investigation of it in January of this year CIA confirms Ventura meeting
[17:08.000 --> 17:13.360]  occurred also the Minneapolis paper also confirmed it and I have the quotes
[17:13.360 --> 17:16.920]  here at first they said I don't recall any indication that the governor had a
[17:16.920 --> 17:20.640]  meeting with CIA agents and then they went on to say you know we don't meet
[17:20.640 --> 17:25.200]  with state officials then they added now that doesn't mean it didn't happen and
[17:25.200 --> 17:28.920]  then others implied you were lying but then they had to admit it and then it
[17:28.920 --> 17:33.640]  has the quotes by the CIA liaison officers saying well yes we like to
[17:33.640 --> 17:38.800]  meet with state officials but we don't like to talk about it well I felt it
[17:38.800 --> 17:43.400]  needed to be talked about because as what happened in this meeting when I went
[17:43.400 --> 17:48.080]  down there bear in mind now I'm the governor and I was I they were very
[17:48.080 --> 17:52.640]  cordial they were very formal they they treated me with great respect let me
[17:52.640 --> 17:58.880]  say that but they summoned you yes and so you know being ex-military you kind of
[17:58.880 --> 18:02.400]  figure when your country summoned you you better go down and talk to him you
[18:02.400 --> 18:06.080]  know I didn't realize fully yet the power that I had as governor it was all
[18:06.080 --> 18:10.080]  very new to me so I went down into the bottles of the Capitol and there were
[18:10.080 --> 18:14.560]  like 23 of them in a big half moon circle around me and you know what the
[18:14.560 --> 18:20.880]  scary thing Alex about it was they were your neighbors and what I mean by that
[18:20.880 --> 18:25.320]  is you saw an elderly woman that looked like the lady down the street that would
[18:25.320 --> 18:29.560]  sweep or walk off in the morning you saw young people you saw they were every
[18:29.560 --> 18:35.600]  race creed color age you could imagine and so you know knowing me I'm a bit
[18:35.600 --> 18:40.840]  arrogant so I said to them I said look I said before I answer any of your
[18:40.840 --> 18:44.960]  questions I said I have a few questions of my own and I the first one I posed
[18:44.960 --> 18:49.560]  was why are you here when your charter states you're not to be operational
[18:49.560 --> 18:53.760]  within the United States of America and what are they saying they didn't really
[18:53.760 --> 18:57.800]  give me an answer you know they haven't been taught and talked around it and
[18:57.800 --> 19:01.480]  then I said now I want to go around the room and I want you to tell me your
[19:01.480 --> 19:05.840]  name and what you do well I'm the governor half of them wouldn't tell me
[19:05.840 --> 19:09.320]  their names half of them wouldn't tell me what they do that's incredible they
[19:09.320 --> 19:13.720]  expect you to meet with them but they won't even tell you their names no and
[19:13.720 --> 19:17.920]  and so I looked at them and said well you know being that you're not being
[19:17.920 --> 19:21.920]  very cooperative with me I'm gonna find it a bit difficult to be cooperative with
[19:21.920 --> 19:28.440]  you amazing and then it turned out here's how the story went they will stay
[19:28.440 --> 19:31.680]  there Jesse Ventura we got a break we'll be right back up to this quick break
[19:31.680 --> 19:36.720]  with governor Jesse Ventura he's got a new book out they're trying to censor it

[24:15.160 --> 24:18.720]  quick segment long segment coming up plenty of time to talk to the governor
[24:18.720 --> 24:22.200]  has been gracious enough to give us a full hour today continuing with your CIA
[24:22.200 --> 24:27.880]  story this is amazing so you say to him I want to know what your name is how did
[24:27.880 --> 24:32.320]  it end did you ever even find out why they were there not really I think it
[24:32.320 --> 24:37.720]  was kind of like maybe like an interrogation for their students or
[24:37.720 --> 24:42.920]  whatever or for their agents or whatever I'm not really sure but when I did go
[24:42.920 --> 24:48.920]  home that day it troubled me a great deal and so I called a friend of mine I
[24:48.920 --> 24:54.000]  don't know if you've heard of Richard Marsenko oh yes the rogue warrior he he's
[24:54.000 --> 24:59.040]  32 years as a Navy SEAL he created the controversial SEAL team 6 the anti
[24:59.040 --> 25:04.040]  terrorist unit red cell and all that and I figured if anybody would know Dick
[25:04.040 --> 25:08.520]  would so I called dick out at Rogue Manor in Virginia and I told him what had
[25:08.520 --> 25:11.960]  happened that day and he kind of laughed at the other end and I said dick do you
[25:11.960 --> 25:16.240]  have any idea why they would do this and he said well you know I'm out of it now
[25:16.240 --> 25:19.840]  and I'm out of touch with all that but he said I got a pretty good idea and I
[25:19.840 --> 25:23.840]  said well give me yours because I said I'm lost as to why this happened and
[25:23.840 --> 25:29.120]  dick and dick was right when he said to me they didn't see you coming because the
[25:29.120 --> 25:34.600]  CIA's job is to gather intelligence and then present what they predict is
[25:34.600 --> 25:39.880]  going to happen and clearly they didn't see me winning in Minnesota and I think
[25:39.880 --> 25:43.760]  they were very much concerned is this a trend they're going to be more
[25:43.760 --> 25:47.320]  independent governors that's what's happening here in the country of the
[25:47.320 --> 25:51.640]  United States which is also interesting because the CIA is not to be
[25:51.640 --> 25:54.680]  operative within the United States according to their charter they're
[25:54.680 --> 25:59.160]  supposed to only be outside the United States but now in the name of anti-
[25:59.160 --> 26:05.480]  terror they are trying to basically set up offices in major US cities and that's
[26:05.480 --> 26:09.240]  even come out though they haven't passed a law in Congress saying they can do it
[26:09.240 --> 26:15.840]  well let's remember this happened before 9-11 absolutely you know 9-11 was all
[26:15.840 --> 26:21.680]  was a couple years later I got elected 98 took office in 99 so this was you know
[26:21.680 --> 26:26.640]  within about a month and a half when I first took office in the year 1999 why
[26:26.640 --> 26:31.680]  do you think they tried to deny it at first I don't know well you know them
[26:31.680 --> 26:36.200]  they're not they don't admit anything right away you know they only when
[26:36.200 --> 26:40.680]  they're cornered will they give you even a partial admitence to anything and you
[26:40.680 --> 26:44.520]  know that's the way they certainly operate I would guess well I have a
[26:44.520 --> 26:48.560]  sneaking suspicion they were trying to develop a relationship with you and then
[26:48.560 --> 26:53.120]  basically try to handle you or see if they could co-opt you and see if you
[26:53.120 --> 26:56.920]  were amenable but then they should have at least given you their fake cover
[26:56.920 --> 27:03.040]  names and acted friendly frankly I'm not very impressed generally with their
[27:03.040 --> 27:07.320]  analysts and the things that they do I mean they are just now figuring out that
[27:07.320 --> 27:13.040]  the mainstream media is dying and the alternative media is exploding
[27:13.040 --> 27:17.920]  well probably because they have much more control over the mainstream media
[27:17.920 --> 27:22.360]  didn't realize that the alternative media could rise up but with the rise of
[27:22.360 --> 27:25.680]  the internet and things like that which they don't have full control of right
[27:25.680 --> 27:30.360]  now I could see that would be a great problem for them the book also gets into
[27:30.360 --> 27:35.840]  your wife finding a bugging device well yeah it was very interesting because
[27:35.840 --> 27:40.040]  they came into my home my actual home now you've got the governor's
[27:40.040 --> 27:43.440]  residence which you use on certain formal occasions and you're certainly
[27:43.440 --> 27:48.160]  entitled to live there but I chose not to I mean I'd use it for formal things
[27:48.160 --> 27:53.000]  but I still maintained and had our horse ranch out Maple Grove Minnesota but
[27:53.000 --> 27:58.600]  what they did is they came in and they installed a red phone which was I
[27:58.600 --> 28:03.160]  understood why it was a phone where if it was merely knocked off the hook the
[28:03.160 --> 28:06.760]  local police would respond it would be there immediately even though I had a
[28:06.760 --> 28:10.920]  guard trailer out in front of my ranch and all that it's done for security
[28:10.920 --> 28:16.240]  reasons but what was interesting was the entire time that I was governor we had
[28:16.240 --> 28:20.920]  phone troubles all the time in my private phone to where you'd hear a lot of
[28:20.920 --> 28:24.520]  clicking and a lot of this and that going on and it got to the point where
[28:24.520 --> 28:28.760]  even my in-laws would call up and they would hear it and and that we
[28:28.760 --> 28:32.320]  laughingly would start saying okay don't say anything you don't want the world
[28:32.320 --> 28:38.600]  to know and all of that stuff well make the long story short we did find a
[28:38.600 --> 28:44.040]  little bugging device after they came in and left my home it was out on my deck
[28:44.040 --> 28:48.080]  and I showed it to a friend of mine who worked for who worked for the telephone
[28:48.080 --> 28:52.080]  company and he kind of raised his eyebrows and I won't say his name but
[28:52.080 --> 28:56.040]  he said oh yeah he said I used to have to put those things in periodically and
[28:56.040 --> 29:01.440]  by government orders and the other thing was after they removed the red phone
[29:01.440 --> 29:06.240]  we should we had real bad phone trouble and when the actual phone company came
[29:06.240 --> 29:10.360]  out they made the quote to us we don't know what went on here but we've never
[29:10.360 --> 29:14.320]  seen a setup like this and it's all you know totally crazy here
[29:14.320 --> 29:18.440]  when they tried to get me back onto my regular phone system it's all in the
[29:18.440 --> 29:21.800]  book don't start the revolution without me we haven't even scratched the service
[29:21.800 --> 29:25.040]  we're gonna get into Jesse Ventura's view on the police state the patreon act

[29:32.840 --> 29:37.400]  gonna be in deep trouble as the deep recession sets in there is so much more

[32:00.240 --> 32:03.840]  to give you knowledge to help you prepare for rough times there's the
[32:03.840 --> 32:07.640]  worldwide famine in our country's dependence on often dangerous food
[32:07.640 --> 32:12.280]  imports you know about genetically poisoned food two-thirds of the food is
[32:12.280 --> 32:16.040]  disappearing with the bees along with huge crop failures from all-time record
[32:16.040 --> 32:20.880]  water shortages you know they're turning food into fuel with corn ethanol
[32:20.880 --> 32:26.640]  plants if we do not control our food food will be used to control us food
[32:26.640 --> 32:30.680]  control has been the plan historically in every enslaved population and is the
[32:30.680 --> 32:35.320]  plan for America the only value of the knowledge you have to take control of
[32:35.320 --> 32:39.480]  your food is if you choose to get a supply while you still have the freedom

[33:29.360 --> 33:34.560]  two days ago I just finished a film called Woodshop up in Boulder Colorado so
[33:34.560 --> 33:38.400]  I'm back doing a little acting again which is a lot of fun but I'm living now
[33:38.400 --> 33:44.840]  at least half the year down in the Baja in Mexico Larry I'm I live one hour
[33:44.840 --> 33:49.440]  from pavement and one hour from electricity about 850 miles down there
[33:49.440 --> 33:53.920]  and amazingly I live with those brown-skinned people that frighten
[33:53.920 --> 33:59.200]  Lou Dobbs so much I mean it's these people that just right fear into Lou
[33:59.200 --> 34:03.480]  Dobbs I can assure Lou they're great people I live among them have you
[34:03.480 --> 34:08.520]  removed yourself from conventional society in a way yeah because I'm off the
[34:08.520 --> 34:13.680]  grid I live totally in a house is obviously by choice oh yes absolutely
[34:13.680 --> 34:18.880]  why why did you leave st. Paul in Minneapolis and well because I'm at
[34:18.880 --> 34:23.960]  the age Larry where I'm young enough yet to need another adventure I'm young
[34:23.960 --> 34:29.200]  enough yet to need another adventure absolutely I lost after adventure tied
[34:29.200 --> 34:33.280]  down to this radio microphone but it is an adventure to talk to Jesse Ventura
[34:33.280 --> 34:39.280]  look immigration I like going to Mexico I like going to El Salvador I like
[34:39.280 --> 34:43.960]  going I mean I'm not afraid of the brown people I think Lou Dobbs this point is
[34:43.960 --> 34:48.480]  that it is driving down the wages it is bankrupting the hospitals and he's
[34:48.480 --> 34:51.720]  married to a Hispanic lady he just never plays that card so he must not be too
[34:51.720 --> 34:56.720]  scared of the brown people I mean I don't think he's a you know somebody who
[34:56.720 --> 35:00.320]  hates the Latin Americans but I also understand your view I don't think
[35:00.320 --> 35:05.320]  they're scary people just economically it's putting a lot of pressure because
[35:05.320 --> 35:08.600]  we do have a welfare state we didn't have this welfare state then it wouldn't
[35:08.600 --> 35:13.640]  be as bad governor any comments exactly Alice Alex the point is blame the
[35:13.640 --> 35:18.680]  people who created our system don't blame the poor Mexicans you know if you
[35:18.680 --> 35:23.520]  want to stop illegal immigration then get down hard on the people that hire
[35:23.520 --> 35:29.600]  them it's the same as the war on drugs we fight it the wrong way we and illegal
[35:29.600 --> 35:33.600]  immigration is the same thing you can't fight it on the supply side you have to
[35:33.600 --> 35:39.080]  fight it on the demand side but now flipping the coin to let's also
[35:39.080 --> 35:44.160]  remember if we ban all these people from coming up here I hope that you're
[35:44.160 --> 35:49.120]  prepared to pay double or triple for your food because the price is going to
[35:49.120 --> 35:53.080]  skyrocket because as I said last night if you're going to make me go out there
[35:53.080 --> 35:58.400]  and pick it I'm going to charge you $200 an hour well I know that that's
[35:58.400 --> 36:01.160]  always been what the corporations have said and certainly there would be some
[36:01.160 --> 36:05.760]  increase but really it's the inflation of the D of the devaluing dollar right
[36:05.760 --> 36:11.160]  now that's driving up the food price yeah but it would also be if you don't
[36:11.160 --> 36:15.040]  have these cheap cheap workers picking it for the price that they're willing to
[36:15.040 --> 36:19.760]  work for again if you're gonna ask me to go out and do it I'm gonna charge you a
[36:19.760 --> 36:24.400]  whole lot more money well if you look at most of the costs I've seen the studies
[36:24.400 --> 36:29.360]  and you're a smart guy you've seen these big agriculture state in Minnesota if
[36:29.360 --> 36:33.880]  you look at most the cost it is the fertilizer it's the equipment it's the
[36:33.880 --> 36:39.520]  shipping and then and then it's the added retail expense and the markup the
[36:39.520 --> 36:44.400]  actual cost of the food is is tiny and even if you doubled it it would be
[36:44.400 --> 36:48.840]  negligible but but I do see your point governor look here's the problem I live
[36:48.840 --> 36:51.460]  in Texas you know you're from Minnesota but you've been in LA and
[36:51.460 --> 36:55.680]  California a lot and you live in Mexico it's great to go down to Mexico my
[36:55.680 --> 36:59.960]  problem is my wife speaks Spanish so she hears the stuff on the radio on the
[36:59.960 --> 37:04.360]  Spanish stations she reads it in the magazine she tells me about it and it's
[37:04.360 --> 37:08.280]  stuff like we're taking over your country this used to be Mexico we're going to
[37:08.280 --> 37:12.400]  get you now that's not the majority of the Mexicans but that's what Scott Lou
[37:12.400 --> 37:17.840]  Dobbs upset to see his wife's Hispanic so he hears about it well and then the
[37:17.840 --> 37:21.560]  point being that they're going to take over our country because of it it
[37:21.560 --> 37:26.560]  belongs to Mexico in the first place well I got news for you offenses and
[37:26.560 --> 37:31.520]  going to be the answer because the Great Wall of China which is the greatest
[37:31.520 --> 37:38.320]  man-made wall to stop someone in history in 1644 was was broken through by the
[37:38.320 --> 37:42.960]  Mongols you're right so so I just hope that at this fence that they build I
[37:42.960 --> 37:48.160]  hope that they make a tourist friendly so that we can at least make tourism
[37:48.160 --> 37:53.120]  money off it on the flip side when they build this fence I'm going to climb it
[37:53.120 --> 37:59.360]  and protest the other way because Alex remember this offense today to keep
[37:59.360 --> 38:04.640]  people out ten years from now might be to keep you in well I love how you think
[38:04.640 --> 38:10.880]  and that's the point I've made is that we do need to prosecute the employers who
[38:10.880 --> 38:14.840]  are you know hiring people for three bucks an hour with no insurance no
[38:14.840 --> 38:20.240]  nothing and then depressing our entire standard of living and I do agree that a
[38:20.240 --> 38:23.640]  fence is going to be pretty much worthless unless it's patrolled by the
[38:23.640 --> 38:27.640]  military and then the whole country's a concentration camp exactly what that
[38:27.640 --> 38:32.120]  does is turn us into East Berlin and I don't particularly want to live in the
[38:32.120 --> 38:35.800]  old East Berlin okay well we got 30 million illegals here they say 20 but
[38:35.800 --> 38:41.760]  it's more like 30 what would you do as president about that
[38:41.760 --> 38:46.320]  again you'd have to come down the only reason I believe they're all coming up
[38:46.320 --> 38:51.400]  here is for economic reasons absolutely the jobs are up here it's available to
[38:51.400 --> 38:55.280]  them so if you're going to attack and stop it you have to stop it at the
[38:55.280 --> 38:59.600]  hiring and you have to make it so that the people who hire the illegals are not
[38:59.600 --> 39:03.520]  in a position to do so that they need to hire people here and then you have to
[39:03.520 --> 39:08.600]  convince our people to do the jobs that the illegals are doing because you know
[39:08.600 --> 39:13.040]  I love playing golf and I play golf all summer up in Minnesota and I'll tell you
[39:13.040 --> 39:17.280]  this if you've got the Mexicans working on the golf course you're gonna have a
[39:17.280 --> 39:21.000]  premier golf course because there's something about them they got green
[39:21.000 --> 39:25.800]  thumbs believe me you don't have to tell me that type of stuff I know we've
[39:25.800 --> 39:29.960]  tried to plant orange trees and other stuff and then we can't do it and then
[39:29.960 --> 39:33.800]  the Mexicans come over the just magically it's it's like they're wizards or
[39:33.800 --> 39:38.000]  something yeah and they're the same on golf courses there they did your golf
[39:38.000 --> 39:43.160]  course is going to be beautiful so you know I think that rather than setting up
[39:43.160 --> 39:48.280]  this East German type defense system or putting our military at the border I
[39:48.280 --> 39:53.600]  think we would do far much better to try to help and and I hate to say this too
[39:53.600 --> 39:58.480]  if the economy were to rise up in Mexico I think you would see the end of the
[39:58.480 --> 40:02.400]  Mexican illegal immigration up to here well that brings me governor into my
[40:02.400 --> 40:07.240]  next point and Mexico has more billionaires per capita than any other
[40:07.240 --> 40:12.280]  nation they have triple the natural resources oil gold timber just
[40:12.280 --> 40:17.280]  everything down there that we have in the lower 48 but they have this corrupt
[40:17.280 --> 40:22.240]  elite that's made deals with our elite to use the US as a dumping ground for
[40:22.240 --> 40:25.760]  their criminals for their poor for people to come across and have the babies
[40:25.760 --> 40:30.360]  the anchor babies the average cost $12,000 for the taxpayer so something's
[40:30.360 --> 40:34.120]  got to be done about that but that expands out into a larger picture you
[40:34.120 --> 40:38.200]  have the private run-for-profit Federal Reserve with governmental power they in
[40:38.200 --> 40:43.320]  93 and 99 change the rules to allow all this liquidity that's now caused Bear
[40:43.320 --> 40:47.200]  Stearns and all these to go under and now the Fed is going to take over four
[40:47.200 --> 40:51.800]  other federal regulatory agencies and have absolute financial power when
[40:51.800 --> 40:55.720]  they're bailing out their own private member banks with our money and
[40:55.720 --> 41:00.280]  devaluing the dollar your take governor on what's happening right now with our
[41:00.280 --> 41:04.480]  economy and these private banks being bailed out well you know it's wrong
[41:04.480 --> 41:09.080]  but you know how do you stop it you know when the powers to be are all in bed
[41:09.080 --> 41:12.920]  with them and that that's the difficult thing and why I'm calling for a
[41:12.920 --> 41:17.240]  revolution in my book it's time to take our country back and the only way you're
[41:17.240 --> 41:22.000]  truly going to do that is to get both the two is to depower both the Democrat
[41:22.000 --> 41:27.240]  and Republican parties who to me are each as bad as each other you know the
[41:27.240 --> 41:32.080]  same lobbyist lobby both sides so they got both sides covered it doesn't matter
[41:32.080 --> 41:39.440]  who wins so you were able to at least do something in Minnesota I mean what are
[41:39.440 --> 41:42.840]  your recommendations just the people you say don't start a revolution without me
[41:42.840 --> 41:48.320]  I mean what what are your stop with your heart your conscience stop being a
[41:48.320 --> 41:53.120]  lemming and start voting for people that don't belong to these two parties and I
[41:53.120 --> 41:58.160]  know people say well that's impossible they the you know your vote is wasted
[41:58.160 --> 42:03.240]  that no it's not a wasted vote is not voting your heart and conscience for
[42:03.240 --> 42:07.640]  that for the candidate that you think would do the best job for you and if we
[42:07.640 --> 42:12.720]  would all break this mold of somehow thinking that you know and stop the
[42:12.720 --> 42:16.560]  Democrats and Republicans in their two-party dictatorship that's going
[42:16.560 --> 42:21.080]  on in this country and start voting for third-party candidates start electing
[42:21.080 --> 42:25.520]  people that are not part of this system that we have we were talking during a
[42:25.520 --> 42:30.160]  break and you said Obama's the best of the three and I tend to agree but it's
[42:30.160 --> 42:35.400]  kind of like you know the best of three latrines I mean he is he is for the
[42:35.400 --> 42:39.640]  establishment on every issue but he did vote right on the war so we got a hand
[42:39.640 --> 42:44.800]  him you know that but your take on this race Barack Obama Hillary bomb bomb
[42:44.800 --> 42:51.760]  bomb bomb Iran McCain well first of all McCain has already said that we'll stay
[42:51.760 --> 42:56.320]  in Iraq for a hundred years if we have to so that eliminates him from any
[42:56.320 --> 43:03.400]  consideration on my part the problem with Hillary is this if you count when
[43:03.400 --> 43:10.160]  when George H.W. Bush was vice president with Reagan we have had only in the
[43:10.160 --> 43:15.640]  administration we've had only Bushes and Clinton since 1980 now that's 28 years
[43:15.640 --> 43:20.720]  are we a dual monarchy because if Hillary gets elected for two terms that's
[43:20.720 --> 43:25.680]  another eight eight years of Clintons which will be more than half of my adult
[43:25.680 --> 43:31.680]  life there was even six years old and we've had Clinton's and Bush's in the
[43:31.680 --> 43:36.840]  White House since over half of the time that I've been allowed to vote that's a
[43:36.840 --> 43:43.360]  good point when Reagan got in with his VP how old were you in 1980 in 1980 I
[43:43.360 --> 43:48.680]  would have been what I was born in 51 so I don't know due to math I've been up
[43:48.680 --> 43:54.560]  since 430 that's that's that's more than half your life yeah it's more than half
[43:54.560 --> 44:00.120]  of my adult behalf of my life we've had Bushes or Clinton's only part of the
[44:00.120 --> 44:05.480]  White House or the administration and now if Hillary gets elected that's four
[44:05.480 --> 44:11.240]  or eight more years of it and I think that in all this great land of ours we
[44:11.240 --> 44:15.320]  should have more than just two families who are qualified to serve as president
[44:15.320 --> 44:20.880]  I agree with you and that brings me into the next subject you have boldly
[44:20.880 --> 44:24.680]  spoken out you know as a soldier yourself understanding our firearms
[44:24.680 --> 44:31.080]  operate that the Kennedy situation with JFK as a cover-up I know you've you've
[44:31.080 --> 44:38.560]  been on a book tour but the BBC came out on Monday with video footage and
[44:38.560 --> 44:43.720]  photos from the Ambassador Hotel and they had what four different former CIA
[44:43.720 --> 44:49.480]  colleagues watch the film footage and say yeah you know that's the known CIA
[44:49.480 --> 44:55.920]  officers from Southeast Asia and the known CIA officers that on his death bed
[44:55.920 --> 45:01.120]  he Howard Hunt said were involved killing JFK he was running the operation I by
[45:01.120 --> 45:04.280]  the way folks have the only video that it hasn't been released yet I'm gonna put
[45:04.280 --> 45:09.920]  it in a film I'm making about JFK got it from his son St. John Hunt so now we
[45:09.920 --> 45:14.560]  even have the film footage of them there at the Ambassador Hotel we have this
[45:14.560 --> 45:20.360]  individual Caesar shooting him in the back four times and you're talking
[45:20.360 --> 45:24.360]  Robert now right yes Robert Kennedy so I'm just giving the list of some
[45:24.360 --> 45:29.360]  background here but but but now with with Robert Kennedy even the BBC and NBC
[45:29.360 --> 45:33.880]  are saying the CIA killed him a are you aware of those revelations and be your
[45:33.880 --> 45:41.120]  comment not just on JFK but RFK well I certainly have studied the JFK murder
[45:41.120 --> 45:45.800]  much more than the RFK murder because when I was wrestling it was
[45:45.800 --> 45:51.680]  interesting that I flew a lot and so one day I picked up a book on the JFK one
[45:51.680 --> 45:54.720]  of the conspiracy books and I got hooked on it because it's far more
[45:54.720 --> 46:00.080]  intriguing than anything Tom Clancy could even write about and so I I've
[46:00.080 --> 46:05.160]  studied it for years and years I believe totally that Howard Hunt and the same
[46:05.160 --> 46:09.040]  people that did Watergate are the ones who were instrumental in killing John
[46:09.040 --> 46:14.200]  F. Kennedy what I found interesting though is this do you remember when LBJ
[46:14.200 --> 46:18.520]  announced that he would not seek nor would he accept his nomination for a
[46:18.520 --> 46:24.000]  second term as president in 1967 yes exactly isn't it do you think it's just
[46:24.000 --> 46:28.960]  coincidence that a mere three days later Robert F. Kennedy was assassinated
[46:28.960 --> 46:35.040]  oh that opened the door for Richard Nixon absolutely but but but now I mean
[46:35.040 --> 46:38.840]  the coroner in LA always said he was shot four times in the back with a
[46:38.840 --> 46:42.400]  different caliber than what Sirhan Sirhan was shooting Sirhan only got one
[46:42.400 --> 46:45.680]  shot off before they grabbed him and aimed the gun at the floor and he still
[46:45.680 --> 46:51.280]  squeezed off the rounds and then you've got this known CIA operative who was
[46:51.280 --> 46:56.720]  behind Robert Kennedy when he then got shot three times in the back and once
[46:56.720 --> 47:01.040]  in the back of the head and now we have the film footage analyzed and the CIA
[47:01.040 --> 47:05.920]  colleagues who worked with the three operatives who were on film there I mean
[47:05.920 --> 47:11.400]  it's open and shut I think so and I think John F. Kennedy to me if you take
[47:11.400 --> 47:20.000]  that also from from a standpoint of of very basic common sense okay they want
[47:20.000 --> 47:24.600]  us to believe that Oswald was this disgruntled little Marine who became
[47:24.600 --> 47:29.400]  Marxist Leninist ran off to Russia defected married a Russian woman came
[47:29.400 --> 47:34.200]  back painted our policy on Cuba decided to get famous and shoot the president
[47:34.200 --> 47:41.280]  right that's incredible well first of all then if that's true then why would
[47:41.280 --> 47:46.680]  anything have to be locked up because of national security because I was a Navy
[47:46.680 --> 47:51.240]  Seal with the top secret security clearance when I was in and I certainly
[47:51.240 --> 47:55.320]  knew a few things but I didn't know that much that would require the majority
[47:55.320 --> 47:59.920]  of everything including my tax records to be locked up because of national
[47:59.920 --> 48:06.440]  security but but now if you were involved in a secret CIA shall we say
[48:06.440 --> 48:12.600]  espionage program to a false defection over to Russia well then certainly you
[48:12.600 --> 48:16.720]  would have knowledge and documentation that probably should be locked up
[48:16.720 --> 48:20.320]  because here's the proof here's the proof three years ago because it is 40
[48:20.320 --> 48:24.680]  something years later they did release a CIA control number he was at the U2 spy
[48:24.680 --> 48:29.160]  base in Japan and then when he defected back to the US they didn't even be
[48:29.160 --> 48:32.680]  briefing they just let him come right back into the country with his bride as
[48:32.680 --> 48:37.200]  if he'd just defected and been an evil traitor they just let him back in well
[48:37.200 --> 48:42.040]  actually that isn't quite true because he disappeared in Amsterdam for a couple
[48:42.040 --> 48:46.200]  days and it was there I believe that he went to a CIA safe no I know but I mean
[48:46.200 --> 48:50.080]  officially they say they just let him in you're right exactly officially they
[48:50.080 --> 48:54.600]  say he just got in but if you follow it closely you'll realize that he spent a
[48:54.600 --> 48:58.360]  couple days in Holland and I think that's where it took place at a safe house
[48:58.360 --> 49:05.600]  Governor Ventura you in your book talking about with a fake news headline
[49:05.600 --> 49:10.640]  saying while independent presidential candidate Jesse Ventura is in a coma for
[49:10.640 --> 49:14.400]  the fourth consecutive day clung to life with family members gathered aside a
[49:14.400 --> 49:17.920]  White House press spokesman denied mounting allegations that accused
[49:17.920 --> 49:23.440]  assassin Raul Santana was part of a wider plot one entry reads what are you
[49:23.440 --> 49:28.960]  saying at the end of the book without statement well what I'm saying is that the book is factual all
[49:28.960 --> 49:32.760]  the way till the last chapter and I and I'm kind of thrown it out there I hope I
[49:32.760 --> 49:37.640]  don't ruin it for everybody but the last chapter is fiction and I use myself as
[49:37.640 --> 49:42.960]  an example and here's what I'm saying I believe very strongly that if an
[49:42.960 --> 49:48.520]  independent candidate like myself a rogue were to get into the president's race
[49:48.520 --> 49:53.000]  legitimately if the polls believed it looked like that he had a chance to win
[49:53.000 --> 49:57.480]  I believe that that candidate would either be physically assassinated or
[49:57.480 --> 50:02.040]  would be assassinated credibility wise or in some manner by our government
[50:02.040 --> 50:07.840]  because I do not believe they would ever allow a true independent or a citizen
[50:07.840 --> 50:12.760]  to become president of the United States and I would say and I say this in all
[50:12.760 --> 50:18.600]  seriousness watch out Barack Obama absolutely incredible revelations from
[50:18.600 --> 50:22.960]  Jesse the mind Ventura governor Ventura final segment coming up sir but not
[50:22.960 --> 50:27.040]  just the book don't start a revolution without me any personal websites or other

[54:22.000 --> 54:27.480]  complex and the dominant media who are on out-of-control power trips governor
[54:27.480 --> 54:31.680]  Ventura has agreed to stay 15 minutes graciously into the next hour and why I
[54:31.680 --> 54:36.200]  interviewed him about a year and a half ago and he got into some questions of
[54:36.200 --> 54:40.880]  9-11 but he said he wanted to research it more he's now he told me read 16 books
[54:40.880 --> 54:46.160]  on that subject and others well he's had time down at his summer or winter home
[54:46.160 --> 54:51.160]  in Mexico and he said he'd be happy to get into 9-11 just he brought it up so
[54:51.160 --> 54:54.920]  he's staying with us a little bit longer to have time to get into that
[54:54.920 --> 55:00.280]  governor Ventura you've got the floor give us your take on 9-11 well first of
[55:00.280 --> 55:04.000]  all Alex let me state this you know being ex-military when the attack
[55:04.000 --> 55:09.000]  initially took place and I was governor I went on a very focused tunnel vision
[55:09.000 --> 55:12.720]  mode that our country had been attacked and what the hell do we need to do to
[55:12.720 --> 55:18.160]  repel it so I today picked myself because at that point in time I had a
[55:18.160 --> 55:24.240]  position of power and if I would have you know not been the way I was the way
[55:24.240 --> 55:29.640]  all of us were so shocked when it happened that in that position of power
[55:29.640 --> 55:34.040]  I could have raised a lot more questions at that time about the things that went
[55:34.040 --> 55:38.640]  down that day and where today when I raised those questions naturally it
[55:38.640 --> 55:43.320]  doesn't quite have the impact that it would have had back then but to me it's
[55:43.320 --> 55:48.000]  questions that are not being answered and haven't been answered about 9-11 and
[55:48.000 --> 55:54.400]  you know first and foremost I think is the fact that okay in in New York City
[55:54.400 --> 55:59.640]  in Manhattan two planes struck two buildings we'll all be in agreement on
[55:59.640 --> 56:05.600]  that I think but how is it that a third building fell five hours later you know
[56:05.600 --> 56:09.960]  what they call World Trade Center building number seven and for people
[56:09.960 --> 56:15.160]  that think well it was just a smaller building it was 51 stories high which of
[56:15.160 --> 56:19.480]  course in Manhattan probably isn't that big of a building but if you're to move
[56:19.480 --> 56:24.280]  that building to Austin Texas or to Minneapolis Minnesota it's a big as huge
[56:24.280 --> 56:27.880]  building it's the biggest how could this building just implode into its own
[56:27.880 --> 56:33.640]  footprint five hours later that's my first question the 9-11 Commission never
[56:33.640 --> 56:38.280]  even brought it up they didn't devote even one page to that in their big
[56:38.280 --> 56:44.800]  volume of investigation number two how could those buildings fail at the speed
[56:44.800 --> 56:50.200]  of gravity you know if you put a stopwatch on them both of those World
[56:50.200 --> 56:55.320]  Trade Center buildings were on the ground in 10 seconds how can that be if
[56:55.320 --> 57:00.000]  you took a billiard ball and dropped it from the height of the World Trade Center
[57:00.000 --> 57:04.920]  in a vacuum it would hit the ground in 9.3 seconds and then if you took that
[57:04.920 --> 57:10.640]  same billiard ball and dropped it 10 stories at a time and merely stopped it
[57:10.640 --> 57:15.720]  and started it it would take 30 seconds if you dropped it every floor of the
[57:15.720 --> 57:20.280]  World Trade Center to the ground simply stopping and starting it on gravity it
[57:20.280 --> 57:25.480]  would take over 100 seconds to reach the ground amazing and yet they're telling
[57:25.480 --> 57:30.160]  us that then and I could go on now after studying it the planes hit the
[57:30.160 --> 57:37.640]  building okay jet fuel is 4-fifths kerosene which is not a hot burning fuel
[57:37.640 --> 57:42.200]  and they want us to believe that it melted these steel structured girders
[57:42.200 --> 57:47.480]  and caused these buildings to pancake collapse to the ground I was on the site
[57:47.480 --> 57:52.000]  within two weeks after it happened and I saw none of these pancakes wouldn't they
[57:52.000 --> 57:56.640]  all be piled up in a huge mass on the ground and yet everything was blown in
[57:56.640 --> 58:03.800]  the dust aerosolized you know and and when you look at it from that aspect
[58:03.800 --> 58:08.880]  it none of it makes any sense if you apply common sense again to it it does
[58:08.880 --> 58:14.120]  not make any sense never before in the annals of history as a fire caused a
[58:14.120 --> 58:19.360]  steel structured building to fall to the ground governor Ventura who did and
[58:19.360 --> 58:24.160]  as the way you know three of them did governor Ventura stay with a 72nd break
[58:24.160 --> 58:29.000]  we're coming right back to you coming in hot and as a underwater demolition
[58:29.000 --> 58:35.520]  expert I want to get your take on explosives we'll be right back thank you

[59:00.760 --> 59:05.760]  their dark order grew now as they hail the birth of the new world order their

[1:00:28.960 --> 1:00:33.560]  we're back live ladies and gentlemen governor jesse ventura is our guest for
[1:00:33.560 --> 1:00:37.240]  another 15 minutes or so the new book just came out yesterday don't start
[1:00:37.240 --> 1:00:41.040]  the revolution without me as part of your seal training you first went
[1:00:41.040 --> 1:00:46.400]  through underwater demolitions or frog teams didn't you sir and so having a
[1:00:46.400 --> 1:00:49.720]  knowledge of control demolition we've had a lot of engineers physicists
[1:00:49.720 --> 1:00:54.600]  architects look at it and say that even if jet fuel could have weakened the
[1:00:54.600 --> 1:00:59.680]  steel it would have had a collapse where it fell over sideways or certain parts
[1:00:59.680 --> 1:01:04.480]  crinkled it wouldn't have aerosolized and fallen straight down with pyroclastic
[1:01:04.480 --> 1:01:10.560]  flows of steel blown in one and two-story pieces sheared off at 45 degree
[1:01:10.560 --> 1:01:14.600]  angles with perfect blast points shooting out hundreds of feet and dust
[1:01:14.600 --> 1:01:20.160]  shooting out miles can you comment on that with your background governor in
[1:01:20.160 --> 1:01:25.040]  underwater demolitions as a frogman first of all it's the same training you
[1:01:25.040 --> 1:01:30.240]  know people for some reason want to separate the udt from the seal and it's
[1:01:30.240 --> 1:01:35.000]  all the same initially it's called buds which is basic underwater demolition
[1:01:35.000 --> 1:01:40.240]  seal training and when you graduate from buds you're fully qualified as a
[1:01:40.240 --> 1:01:45.680]  demolition expert whether you go to a udt team or to a seal team it's basically
[1:01:45.680 --> 1:01:50.040]  the needs of the navy and actually they would generally send the better
[1:01:50.040 --> 1:01:54.640]  swimmers to the udt teams because they they tend to work a little bit more in
[1:01:54.640 --> 1:01:59.080]  the water and every class your top swimmers will go to the udt teams where
[1:01:59.080 --> 1:02:02.560]  you guys that can't quite swim as good will go to the seal team but they're
[1:02:02.560 --> 1:02:06.640]  completely interchangeable especially once you've completed what they called
[1:02:06.640 --> 1:02:11.360]  seal cadre which was advanced guerrilla warfare so I spent three years with
[1:02:11.360 --> 1:02:16.000]  underwater demolition team 12 and then I spent two years attached to seal team
[1:02:16.000 --> 1:02:22.320]  one in the reserves but uh I'll you know again am I a demolition expert on a
[1:02:22.320 --> 1:02:27.840]  controlled demolition to drop a building no because our standard policy when we
[1:02:27.840 --> 1:02:32.120]  would figure out how to blow something up we would use the slide rule and then
[1:02:32.120 --> 1:02:37.360]  we always had a standard rule when in doubt overload so what that means is
[1:02:37.360 --> 1:02:41.360]  when you figure out how to blow it up throw on an extra haversack to see for
[1:02:41.360 --> 1:02:45.720]  just to make sure you get the job done because in our type of demolition work
[1:02:45.720 --> 1:02:50.120]  in warfare you're not worried about whether everything blows up you don't
[1:02:50.120 --> 1:02:54.080]  worry about a controlled demolition which is what they would use to drop a
[1:02:54.080 --> 1:02:57.680]  building so that it wouldn't affect any of the other building my point is is
[1:02:57.680 --> 1:03:01.560]  that you've worked with explosives what does it look like to you well upon
[1:03:01.560 --> 1:03:06.520]  looking at the film in super slow motion and the way the building fell and
[1:03:06.520 --> 1:03:11.360]  comparing that to the way that they do like a controlled demolition of a hotel
[1:03:11.360 --> 1:03:17.200]  in Las Vegas they both fall out fell identical and it just is beyond me and
[1:03:17.200 --> 1:03:22.840]  I again I take myself for when it initially happened that the light
[1:03:22.840 --> 1:03:27.120]  didn't go off but again I was so shocked that this thing had even taken place
[1:03:27.120 --> 1:03:31.720]  that I you know again I apologize for not being more aware but I don't think I
[1:03:31.720 --> 1:03:35.920]  was alone as were most of the people in the United States well what about seven
[1:03:35.920 --> 1:03:40.360]  I mean you talk about the freefall speed of the 110 story towers at the speed of
[1:03:40.360 --> 1:03:44.440]  gravity seven falls at the speed of gravity and it's the classic where you
[1:03:44.440 --> 1:03:47.840]  see the penthouse fall the central beam they blow out then they blow the side
[1:03:47.840 --> 1:03:52.600]  beams it collapses the CIA the FBI defense intelligence we're all based there
[1:03:52.600 --> 1:03:56.760]  we have videos of police saying get back they're gonna blow it up now firemen
[1:03:56.760 --> 1:03:59.560]  say and get back the government said they're gonna blow it up then they say
[1:03:59.560 --> 1:04:02.920]  oh we didn't blow it up have you seen those videos of police saying get back
[1:04:02.920 --> 1:04:08.640]  no I have not I haven't seen those but I did watch the actual film of building
[1:04:08.640 --> 1:04:13.080]  seven going down and in my opinion there's no doubt that that building was
[1:04:13.080 --> 1:04:17.560]  brought down with demolition and when you look at how that building came down it
[1:04:17.560 --> 1:04:23.600]  came down identical to the other two just incredible when we come back I want

[1:08:02.280 --> 1:08:07.160]  the near future just an amazing interview with poor Minnesota Governor
[1:08:07.160 --> 1:08:11.960]  Jesse Ventura Hollywood movie star wrestling champion best-selling author
[1:08:11.960 --> 1:08:17.960]  surfer it's great getting to meet him in person we was with kinky Friedman and
[1:08:17.960 --> 1:08:22.040]  we've had Willie Nelson called up a month or two ago and said hey I want to
[1:08:22.040 --> 1:08:25.520]  come on your show and talk about 9-11 being an inside job and he came on and
[1:08:25.520 --> 1:08:30.200]  talked about it Governor Ventura what is the establishment gonna do as the one
[1:08:30.200 --> 1:08:33.440]  of the most respected living Italian presidents former head of their
[1:08:33.440 --> 1:08:37.080]  intelligence went public and said 9-11 was carried out by criminal elements of
[1:08:37.080 --> 1:08:47.480]  the government what are what are people gonna do as we see more and more and
[1:08:47.480 --> 1:08:54.400]  more and more former CIA section chiefs we have just hundreds of engineers
[1:08:54.400 --> 1:08:59.320]  physicists we've got Bob bear that the movie Siriana is about a famous steel
[1:08:59.320 --> 1:09:03.520]  commander saying all the evidence points at inside job we have underwriting
[1:09:03.520 --> 1:09:07.960]  laboratories Kevin Ryan they did internal test and said it was impossible
[1:09:07.960 --> 1:09:12.800]  with building seven what are they gonna do as the laws of physics come out here
[1:09:12.800 --> 1:09:18.000]  well they're gonna continue to deny it your mainstream media is gonna
[1:09:18.000 --> 1:09:22.720]  completely ignore anything you know the mainstream media has never shown the
[1:09:22.720 --> 1:09:29.000]  film of building seven going down and what we have to do in my opinion is
[1:09:29.000 --> 1:09:34.680]  people like you and your radio show and people like me continue to tell people
[1:09:34.680 --> 1:09:38.880]  everywhere I go I tell people to go to the internet and watch loose change
[1:09:38.880 --> 1:09:44.240]  because my son turned me on to that and of course when he first told me I thought
[1:09:44.240 --> 1:09:48.560]  come on you know they can put anything on the internet when I when I finally did
[1:09:48.560 --> 1:09:52.920]  watch it that you know I went through every emotion you could imagine from
[1:09:52.920 --> 1:09:57.560]  laughing crying getting sick to my stomach to everything the whole
[1:09:57.560 --> 1:10:01.880]  emotional thing and I think the best thing we can do is just to keep
[1:10:01.880 --> 1:10:07.480]  communicating and hopefully the truth will come out eventually if enough
[1:10:07.480 --> 1:10:12.000]  pressure is put on and enough people gain knowledge of what's going on in the
[1:10:12.000 --> 1:10:16.600]  world and and we don't want to lose our country after all it's still our
[1:10:16.600 --> 1:10:21.960]  country and until they put us down that we have the power and then we have the
[1:10:21.960 --> 1:10:26.280]  power to vote these people out of office and get people in there that have the
[1:10:26.280 --> 1:10:30.440]  best interest of the country in mind governor I produced loose change final
[1:10:30.440 --> 1:10:33.320]  cut it just came out a few months ago have you seen that I need to mail you a
[1:10:33.320 --> 1:10:38.360]  copy of it no I have not but I'll tell you what Alex when I get back to the
[1:10:38.360 --> 1:10:41.880]  states I got your phone number here I'll give you a call and you can fire it up
[1:10:41.880 --> 1:10:48.360]  to me absolutely and I will be back in May so it isn't that far off fantastic
[1:10:48.360 --> 1:10:53.000]  now I gave you a copy of Terror Storm did you have a chance to watch that review
[1:10:53.000 --> 1:10:57.560]  it for me quick remember when we met here in Texas I gave you a car it's just a
[1:10:57.560 --> 1:11:01.240]  history of government-sponsored terrorism okay okay I vaguely remember it
[1:11:01.240 --> 1:11:06.160]  yeah I've been reading so much and all that that yeah definitely now I do you
[1:11:06.160 --> 1:11:10.240]  told me that you read 16 books in the interim researching this and other
[1:11:10.240 --> 1:11:15.200]  subjects what are other questions you have about the official story well the
[1:11:15.200 --> 1:11:20.240]  other questions I have again our why was there no wreckage outside of the
[1:11:20.240 --> 1:11:25.640]  Pentagon when the Pentagon was supposedly hit by this other plane and I in fact
[1:11:25.640 --> 1:11:30.480]  when I was watching loose change with a friend of mine he happens to work for a
[1:11:30.480 --> 1:11:35.120]  company that helps to build the Boeing airplanes and when they said that the
[1:11:35.120 --> 1:11:40.360]  engines completely disappeared and were destroyed his response excuse my
[1:11:40.360 --> 1:11:45.960]  French was bullshit and I turned to him and said why he said because they're
[1:11:45.960 --> 1:11:50.640]  made out of titanium steel they cut they can't disintegrate well they said that
[1:11:50.640 --> 1:11:55.200]  the whole plane disintegrated right but the engines would never because the
[1:11:55.200 --> 1:12:00.720]  titanium steel well I wonder why they're still keeping all the cameras secret
[1:12:00.720 --> 1:12:06.080]  I don't know well but obviously why Alex they don't want any of us paying
[1:12:06.080 --> 1:12:10.440]  attention anymore they you know remember something most people in the United
[1:12:10.440 --> 1:12:15.920]  States have a attention span of about what 30 minutes yes and then they're
[1:12:15.920 --> 1:12:20.800]  on and they don't pay attention after that and the problem is and I
[1:12:20.800 --> 1:12:26.400]  encourage people all the time stop watching TV and start that old thing
[1:12:26.400 --> 1:12:32.240]  called reading you know start reading again because it's the dumbing down of
[1:12:32.240 --> 1:12:38.160]  America that's happening right now case in point last year every major news
[1:12:38.160 --> 1:12:43.240]  station in America for 30 days covered the death lead story of Ann and Nicole
[1:12:43.240 --> 1:12:49.880]  Smith they did and I mean I sat and got so angry because I thought who how does
[1:12:49.880 --> 1:12:54.080]  this woman warrant all of this it's a distraction he had me up she was a
[1:12:54.080 --> 1:12:58.640]  playboy playmate and a gold digger well we have troops dying in Iraq we have the
[1:12:58.640 --> 1:13:02.880]  economy going to hell in a hand basket we have all this corruption and in the
[1:13:02.880 --> 1:13:05.280]  five minutes we've got left with the governor we are gonna let you go because
[1:13:05.280 --> 1:13:09.560]  I know you're very busy and I have a break before your next interview I would
[1:13:09.560 --> 1:13:14.040]  like to get your take on the White House why do they think they could sell
[1:13:14.040 --> 1:13:18.680]  torture and and White House memos about torturing children with pliers in front
[1:13:18.680 --> 1:13:23.760]  of their parents why did they think they could lie about WMD's I mean does that
[1:13:23.760 --> 1:13:28.240]  play into the hubris of folks that would be involved in 9-11 attack well
[1:13:28.240 --> 1:13:33.680]  because always remember this but the most dastardly person in the world that I
[1:13:33.680 --> 1:13:39.600]  know of was Adolf Hitler that I've ever read about and remember what his most
[1:13:39.600 --> 1:13:45.040]  famous quote was the bigger the lie the easier the sell that's it because people
[1:13:45.040 --> 1:13:49.680]  just can't believe it it's the the the audacity well let me put it to you
[1:13:49.680 --> 1:13:53.960]  another way my my in my mom and dad are both gone now I've been an orphan from
[1:13:53.960 --> 1:13:57.920]  nineteen since 1995 but my wife's parents are still alive and they're
[1:13:57.920 --> 1:14:03.040]  elderly people and when I try to bring this up with them they don't want to
[1:14:03.040 --> 1:14:08.720]  believe it and the reason is so simple they don't believe anyone can be that
[1:14:08.720 --> 1:14:14.800]  evil and I think a great deal of people in this country are of that same thought
[1:14:14.800 --> 1:14:19.640]  they don't believe that people can be that easy and that's how Hitler was able
[1:14:19.640 --> 1:14:23.480]  to do what he did because people judge the world according to themselves and if
[1:14:23.480 --> 1:14:26.600]  they're nice sweet people then they think and that's the main reason
[1:14:26.600 --> 1:14:30.960]  criminologists say women you know get in yellow volts wagons with Ted Bundy
[1:14:30.960 --> 1:14:35.040]  because they can't believe a nice guy in a nice suit is gonna be biting chunks
[1:14:35.040 --> 1:14:39.720]  out of them an hour later exactly and that's the thing we have to wake up to
[1:14:39.720 --> 1:14:45.280]  is that there are bad people there are evil people and when we sit back then
[1:14:45.280 --> 1:14:50.200]  you know evil prevails if we allow it to happen so we really have to in many
[1:14:50.200 --> 1:14:54.840]  ways blame ourselves for our own media today because we're following this
[1:14:54.840 --> 1:14:59.960]  national inquirer media entertainment on TV instead of having them being
[1:14:59.960 --> 1:15:04.920]  hardline you know the downfall to the regular media actually was the show
[1:15:04.920 --> 1:15:10.680]  60 minutes then and what I mean by that is 60 minutes was a great show and they
[1:15:10.680 --> 1:15:14.040]  would do some great investigative reporting but here was the downfall
[1:15:14.040 --> 1:15:19.520]  up until that point in time the media wrote the news office of business loss
[1:15:19.520 --> 1:15:24.000]  that there was a required thing they had to do but it didn't make money when 60
[1:15:24.000 --> 1:15:27.960]  minutes came out all of a sudden 60 minutes was breaking into the top 10
[1:15:27.960 --> 1:15:32.040]  and all of a sudden the light went off with the bean counters you mean we could
[1:15:32.040 --> 1:15:37.280]  make money off the news and there was your downfall they then became they got
[1:15:37.280 --> 1:15:41.440]  into creating the news instead of reporting it well and then the CIA
[1:15:41.440 --> 1:15:46.120]  moved in big time to try and influence the media that's been admitted getting
[1:15:46.120 --> 1:15:49.680]  back in the couple minutes we've got left with you governor to 9-11 as a
[1:15:49.680 --> 1:15:55.720]  military man in your history 44,000 US troops 18,000 British troops two
[1:15:55.720 --> 1:16:00.640]  aircraft carrier attack groups in the three months before 9-11 masked in the
[1:16:00.640 --> 1:16:05.080]  countries and in the waters off of Afghanistan Newsweek reported Bush the
[1:16:05.080 --> 1:16:11.240]  day before 9-11 signed the attack orders to go into Afghanistan one week later
[1:16:11.240 --> 1:16:16.360]  isn't that pretty obvious when you have all of these troops being masked and
[1:16:16.360 --> 1:16:21.800]  then Bush says oh we went in because of 9-11 I can't answer that Alex because
[1:16:21.800 --> 1:16:25.520]  that's information I have no knowledge about I have to just simply take your
[1:16:25.520 --> 1:16:29.800]  word for it but if that is true then absolutely yes well I mean here's an
[1:16:29.800 --> 1:16:32.400]  example you know about Gulf of Tonkin because I talked to you a year and a
[1:16:32.400 --> 1:16:36.840]  half ago about that they now admit that that was staged they now admit
[1:16:36.840 --> 1:16:41.440]  Chicago Tribune that Israel did attack the liberty and 67 to try to blame it on
[1:16:41.440 --> 1:16:45.720]  Egypt that's now declassified that that debates over I mean governments all
[1:16:45.720 --> 1:16:50.800]  governments have been caught Putin's been caught doing things like this do we
[1:16:50.800 --> 1:16:54.720]  need to have a renaissance and awakening to this so criminal elements and
[1:16:54.720 --> 1:16:58.080]  government stop doing it I mean how important is it to expose false flag
[1:16:58.080 --> 1:17:03.360]  terror well that's why I wrote the book Alex it's don't start the revolution
[1:17:03.360 --> 1:17:07.680]  without me and I believe we must have a revolution in which to take our country
[1:17:07.680 --> 1:17:12.920]  back in closing Governor Ventura the book bound to be a best-seller don't
[1:17:12.920 --> 1:17:16.640]  start the revolution without me the war fifth year anniversary was just a few
[1:17:16.640 --> 1:17:21.280]  weeks ago the Pentagon plans they will be there at least 50 years McCain says
[1:17:21.280 --> 1:17:26.960]  a hundred Cheney said hundred year war I mean how can we get the troops home
[1:17:26.960 --> 1:17:32.120]  when they sell it in a way it's true that by putting the troops there it
[1:17:32.120 --> 1:17:35.640]  wrecked it so now we have to stay there to fix it but the study show we left it
[1:17:35.640 --> 1:17:40.800]  would get better I mean what would you do as president and you said on Larry
[1:17:40.800 --> 1:17:45.720]  King last night so a the war and then B you said that 80 something percent on
[1:17:45.720 --> 1:17:50.120]  Larry King live in the poll wanted you to run for president are you thinking
[1:17:50.120 --> 1:17:53.200]  about running this year or you think about running in four years well it's
[1:17:53.200 --> 1:17:57.320]  impossible for me to run this year unless somebody could get me ballot access
[1:17:57.320 --> 1:18:01.680]  in all 50 states which is very very difficult to do because the two-party
[1:18:01.680 --> 1:18:06.160]  system is set up so that there can't be any third entity that gets it gets in
[1:18:06.160 --> 1:18:10.920]  there to give people an alternative choice so it's impossible for me to run
[1:18:10.920 --> 1:18:14.880]  at this late date I would think I mean nothing's impossible but they it would
[1:18:14.880 --> 1:18:21.160]  be very slim to not to be able to do it what we've what we've got to do is like
[1:18:21.160 --> 1:18:26.000]  I said we got to quit electing these people of the status quo whoever comes

[1:24:03.760 --> 1:24:10.440]  here's a little clip in this segment the next it's like an hour long the whole
[1:24:10.440 --> 1:24:17.560]  thing's on the web for a BBC documentary where they just proved but we
[1:24:17.560 --> 1:24:23.720]  already knew that three CIA operatives at least several others well-known ones
[1:24:23.720 --> 1:24:28.640]  Frank Morales and others at the ambassador hotel 40 years ago killing
[1:24:28.640 --> 1:24:33.440]  Bobby Kennedy so we're gonna play that while I take a little break and eat some
[1:24:33.440 --> 1:24:38.000]  lunch let's just get honest here but it's really good then we're gonna come
[1:24:38.000 --> 1:24:42.320]  back and take calls and cover news balance of the show I'll be sitting here
[1:24:42.320 --> 1:24:44.640]  with you folks listening here it is
[1:24:44.640 --> 1:24:49.120]  well had he lived Bobby Kennedy would have been 81 today instead of which he
[1:24:49.120 --> 1:24:52.200]  was killed in one of the most famous political assassinations of modern
[1:24:52.200 --> 1:24:57.240]  American history a Palestinian man Sir Han Sir Han was seized charged tried and
[1:24:57.240 --> 1:25:02.520]  convicted nearly 40 years on he's still in jail repeatedly denied parole the
[1:25:02.520 --> 1:25:05.800]  violent deaths of prominent people whether they be Bobby Kennedy's brother
[1:25:05.800 --> 1:25:10.040]  JFK or even Diana Princess of Wales routinely attract conspiracy theories
[1:25:10.040 --> 1:25:14.240]  but that wasn't uppermost in the mind of Shane O'Sullivan when he began to look
[1:25:14.240 --> 1:25:19.840]  into the assassination there's some strong language in his film one thing is
[1:25:19.840 --> 1:25:26.040]  clear this year of 1968 I believe in this country as I traveled across that is
[1:25:26.040 --> 1:25:37.360]  that the American people want no more Vietnam
[1:25:37.360 --> 1:25:41.800]  the Democratic Party will nominate its candidate a president of the United
[1:25:41.800 --> 1:25:47.160]  States there are two roads to that nomination one is to seek commitments
[1:25:47.160 --> 1:25:51.320]  through discussions with political leaders the other is to go to the
[1:25:51.320 --> 1:26:01.640]  people June 5th 1968 the ambassador hotel Los Angeles Bobby Kennedy wins the
[1:26:01.640 --> 1:26:05.600]  California Democratic primary and is tipped to get Nixon to the White House I
[1:26:05.600 --> 1:26:11.360]  think it's quite clear is that we can work together in the last analysis and
[1:26:11.360 --> 1:26:14.760]  that what has been going on within the United States over the period of the
[1:26:14.760 --> 1:26:20.080]  last three years the divisions the violence the disenchantment with our
[1:26:20.080 --> 1:26:23.560]  society the divisions whether it's between blacks and whites between the
[1:26:23.560 --> 1:26:28.080]  poor and the more affluent or between age groups or on the war in Vietnam that we
[1:26:28.080 --> 1:26:32.040]  can start to work together we are a great country in a selfish country and a
[1:26:32.040 --> 1:26:36.240]  compassionate country and I intend to make that my basis for running and over
[1:26:36.240 --> 1:26:42.480]  the period of mere Yordie has just sent me a message that we've been here too
[1:26:42.480 --> 1:26:50.040]  long already so my thanks to all of you and now it's on to Chicago and let's
[1:26:50.040 --> 1:26:55.200]  win there moments later he is assassinated while leaving through a
[1:26:55.200 --> 1:26:58.160]  kitchen country
[1:26:58.160 --> 1:27:13.960]  oh my god
[1:27:13.960 --> 1:27:31.120]  it's only two months since the assassination of Martin Luther King 24
[1:27:31.120 --> 1:27:34.920]  year old Palestinian Sirhan Sirhan is seen firing at Kennedy and is arrested
[1:27:34.920 --> 1:27:39.320]  as the lone assassin but for nearly 40 years debate has raged over whether a
[1:27:39.320 --> 1:27:44.120]  second gunman was involved police diagrams based on the autopsy show the
[1:27:44.120 --> 1:27:48.160]  fatal shot came from behind but witnesses place Sirhan's gun several
[1:27:48.160 --> 1:27:53.960]  views in front of Kennedy the actual shooter of Robert Kennedy was standing
[1:27:53.960 --> 1:27:57.760]  behind Robert Kennedy according to the autopsy report Sirhan was standing in
[1:27:57.760 --> 1:28:02.600]  front of him face-to-face the distance between the muzzle of the assailants
[1:28:02.600 --> 1:28:06.440]  weapon and Robert Kennedy's body was somewhere between actual contact and no
[1:28:06.440 --> 1:28:10.720]  more than three inches and the weapon from which the shots were fired was
[1:28:10.720 --> 1:28:15.880]  held at a sharp upper angle again from the rear all the witnesses state Sirhan's
[1:28:15.880 --> 1:28:19.360]  weapon was held between one and a half and six feet away from Robert Kennedy
[1:28:19.360 --> 1:28:23.920]  horizontally in relation to the floor the autopsy report exonerates Sirhan
[1:28:23.920 --> 1:28:27.080]  behind me is the famous ambassador who tell where Robert Kennedy was
[1:28:27.080 --> 1:28:30.520]  assassinated that night it's now a construction site shortly to be a high
[1:28:30.520 --> 1:28:34.760]  school project in memory of Bobby Kennedy I started running a screenplay three
[1:28:34.760 --> 1:28:38.640]  years ago based on this case fascinated by the conspiracy theories during the
[1:28:38.640 --> 1:28:42.800]  course of my research I found new video and photographs that suggested three CIA
[1:28:42.800 --> 1:28:46.120]  operatives were at the hotel that night and I believe involved in the
[1:28:46.120 --> 1:28:51.120]  assassination agent number one the Indian man in the white shirt at the back
[1:28:51.120 --> 1:28:55.520]  of the room moments after the speech and just before the shooting I think this
[1:28:55.520 --> 1:29:01.720]  man is David Morales moments after the shooting agent number two Gordon Campbell
[1:29:01.720 --> 1:29:06.240]  walks from the direction of the pantry with a small container in his hand as a
[1:29:06.240 --> 1:29:11.960]  Latin man waves him towards an exit thirty minutes after the shooting here
[1:29:11.960 --> 1:29:17.680]  is agent one again David Morales I also found several photographs of these
[1:29:17.680 --> 1:29:23.160]  agents earlier in the evening here agent two Gordon Campbell stands in the
[1:29:23.160 --> 1:29:28.040]  ballroom hours before the shooting with a third agent these officers worked
[1:29:28.040 --> 1:29:35.720]  together in 1963 a jam-wave the CIA's Miami base for its secret war on Castro

[1:33:55.080 --> 1:34:02.480]  guests lined up later this month I love giving it to the new world order most
[1:34:02.480 --> 1:34:05.880]  people in our government are good they're compartmentalized they don't know
[1:34:05.880 --> 1:34:09.360]  what they're doing and if we can just wake them up and wake the people up in
[1:34:09.360 --> 1:34:14.480]  corporate America we can turn this around and as more people go public as
[1:34:14.480 --> 1:34:20.480]  actress of the year best actress Oscar and his presidents and members of
[1:34:20.480 --> 1:34:25.000]  parliament and Japanese parliament and European parliament go public it is
[1:34:25.000 --> 1:34:29.800]  gaining exponential energy we're gonna take calls and I got a bunch of news I
[1:34:29.800 --> 1:34:33.520]  haven't gotten to yet as well but I'm gonna wait till the last 30 minutes the
[1:34:33.520 --> 1:34:39.400]  next 45 50 minutes the rest of this hour into the next hour it is gonna be all
[1:34:39.400 --> 1:34:47.000]  your phone calls on any subjects you'd like to discuss at 1-800-259-9231 on
[1:34:47.000 --> 1:34:53.280]  this Wednesday April 2nd 2008 edition 1-800-259-9231 and here's how it works
[1:34:53.280 --> 1:34:59.280]  first-time callers go to the head of the line you are only trumped by people that
[1:34:59.280 --> 1:35:06.720]  disagree and I don't do that every day where you get trumped by first-time
[1:35:06.720 --> 1:35:11.480]  callers that is we do that about once a week but every day if you disagree go
[1:35:11.480 --> 1:35:18.960]  to the head of the line other than that there's no call screening in fact if you
[1:35:18.960 --> 1:35:21.880]  want to call it and say you're calling from the moon your name's mud we don't
[1:35:21.880 --> 1:35:26.800]  care if you volunteer you disagree head of the line our enemies still lie on the
[1:35:26.800 --> 1:35:30.600]  web and say that we screen calls and that it's fake callers that's because
[1:35:30.600 --> 1:35:34.960]  they're enemies of the Republic all you've got to do is call in right now and
[1:35:34.960 --> 1:35:42.520]  find out the truth for yourself 1-800-259-9231 finish up a little piece
[1:35:42.520 --> 1:35:49.480]  of this Bobby Kennedy film BBC and then we'll go right to your phone calls
[1:35:49.480 --> 1:35:55.760]  Bradley airs worked with these men at J.M. Wave and first confirm my identification
[1:35:55.760 --> 1:36:04.720]  of Morales this definitely from the profile is hugely similar the body
[1:36:04.720 --> 1:36:11.120]  language is very very much characteristic of Morales
[1:36:13.640 --> 1:36:18.760]  see how he moves back and forth very casually does not attract attention to
[1:36:18.760 --> 1:36:28.120]  himself that that is no question
[1:36:28.120 --> 1:36:34.680]  Bradley also recognized his former case officer Gordon Campbell yeah that's
[1:36:34.680 --> 1:36:43.600]  excellent that's I could I could certainly verify 90% ID of Gordon Campbell
[1:36:43.600 --> 1:36:51.280]  and less a little hair as I remembered him the facial features are certainly
[1:36:51.280 --> 1:36:56.920]  his absolutely obviously if you're not together they're looking for a way out
[1:36:56.920 --> 1:37:02.160]  because this fellow is guiding him showing him an exit obviously he's got
[1:37:02.160 --> 1:37:07.600]  something in his hand I think it's impossible to determine what it is
[1:37:07.600 --> 1:37:12.280]  these men are alleged to have hated the Kennedys for withdrawing air support for
[1:37:12.280 --> 1:37:17.440]  the failed Bay of Pigs invasion in 1961 and Morales admitted to his ex-lawyer
[1:37:17.440 --> 1:37:28.320]  that he was involved in both Kennedy assassinations I was in Dallas when we
[1:37:28.320 --> 1:37:33.920]  got that I was in Los Angeles when we got the little bastard what it said to
[1:37:33.920 --> 1:37:43.880]  me was that he was in some way implicated with the death of John Kennedy
[1:37:43.880 --> 1:37:51.080]  and let's go one step further and also Bobby an interesting claim from a
[1:37:51.080 --> 1:37:55.960]  friend of Morales but until now there's been no photographic evidence I traveled
[1:37:55.960 --> 1:37:59.640]  to Washington to meet Wayne Smith who worked with Morales at the USM is he
[1:37:59.640 --> 1:38:05.400]  in Havana in 1959 this photograph of Morales dates from the same time would
[1:38:05.400 --> 1:38:16.000]  Smith recognize Morales in the video that's a Morales really
[1:38:19.840 --> 1:38:25.000]  yeah I'm virtually certain is there anything no it's him again
[1:38:25.000 --> 1:38:36.600]  let me get it yeah yeah I mean that's that's Morales that's Morales yeah I
[1:38:36.600 --> 1:38:42.920]  knew Morales quite well he worked in the CIA station in Havana when I was third
[1:38:42.920 --> 1:38:50.440]  secretary of the political section and got to know him fairly well and saw him
[1:38:50.440 --> 1:38:55.960]  again a number of times he came to Buenos Aires when I was political
[1:38:55.960 --> 1:39:02.280]  counselor down there and we had dinner at a friend's house one evening so yeah
[1:39:02.280 --> 1:39:10.040]  I have no hesitation in saying that's that's Morales all right we're gonna be
[1:39:10.040 --> 1:39:16.960]  taking your calls here in just a second by the way I know we're getting a lot of
[1:39:16.960 --> 1:39:20.400]  emails and the message boards and people saying oh man I didn't know you had
[1:39:20.400 --> 1:39:24.840]  Jesse Ventura coming on but it wasn't just an interview with Jesse Ventura
[1:39:24.840 --> 1:39:30.040]  they always spill their guts on this show it's the fact of what they say on
[1:39:30.040 --> 1:39:34.600]  this show and we even have video plugged into the board because we videotaped
[1:39:34.600 --> 1:39:38.720]  myself in here live and then we put images to it and put it up for Prison
[1:39:38.720 --> 1:39:44.800]  Planet TV members put a shorter version up on YouTube for everybody and so I'm
[1:39:44.800 --> 1:39:51.640]  talking to Ventura during the break we're gonna put some of this on the web and
[1:39:51.640 --> 1:39:55.800]  I wasn't even gonna bring 9-eleven up because I'd already done a 9-eleven
[1:39:55.800 --> 1:40:00.680]  interview with him and off record he'd said more on record he was kind of
[1:40:00.680 --> 1:40:04.120]  irritated by it he told me I want to do more research yeah I've read some stuff
[1:40:04.120 --> 1:40:09.200]  but I'm gonna look into this and he did that was about a year and a half ago so
[1:40:09.200 --> 1:40:11.960]  I wasn't gonna bring 9-eleven up and then I went and talked to him during a
[1:40:11.960 --> 1:40:14.560]  break and I'm like hey let's talk about the war when we get back he goes hey I
[1:40:14.560 --> 1:40:21.040]  want to get into 9-eleven but let's talk about it I wasn't ready but now I am and
[1:40:21.040 --> 1:40:27.640]  then he came and repeated that on air but I mean major breaking news so it was in
[1:40:27.640 --> 1:40:32.640]  the first hour I give you hints see there are powers that be behind the scenes
[1:40:32.640 --> 1:40:36.280]  there are people that put pressure on folks that's why we never tell you when

[1:42:45.960 --> 1:42:53.240]  the information I'm out of control ladies and gentlemen but I get in
[1:42:53.240 --> 1:42:57.520]  dolphins when we get a big guest and they talk about powerful things important
[1:42:57.520 --> 1:43:01.360]  things when we hurt the New World Order we bring them one step closer to the
[1:43:01.360 --> 1:43:14.800]  gallows I start having intense feelings of pleasure hold on I don't need any
[1:43:14.800 --> 1:43:21.320]  drugs to take a take a ride ladies and gentlemen I'm high as a kite right now
[1:43:21.320 --> 1:43:26.040]  because believe me this story is going to be big and it's going to have an
[1:43:26.040 --> 1:43:31.680]  effect and it's one more step towards the throats of the New World Order and
[1:43:31.680 --> 1:43:36.160]  bringing them to justice and I see more and more people standing up and showing
[1:43:36.160 --> 1:43:43.160]  courage it is the dam broke a long time ago and now the floodgates are opening
[1:43:43.160 --> 1:43:47.760]  and if you can't celebrate major victories I don't know what's wrong with
[1:43:47.760 --> 1:43:55.040]  you it's like Ron Paul people think because he's not winning the presidency
[1:43:55.040 --> 1:43:59.240]  but he's staying in the race that we've lost no we won when we stood up and
[1:43:59.240 --> 1:44:03.000]  fought we won when we made the international bankers and the currency
[1:44:03.000 --> 1:44:08.600]  tax the inflation tax the open borders a big issue when we expose the New World
[1:44:08.600 --> 1:44:13.360]  Order when Ron Paul stood up and showed that we're five years into a war that
[1:44:13.360 --> 1:44:18.200]  all the other candidates are basically pushing it and we grew tens of millions
[1:44:18.200 --> 1:44:22.880]  of people we grew our movement they came in they woke up now they're finding out
[1:44:22.880 --> 1:44:36.680]  more hardcore info I mean Al Gore is trying to hire 10 million cronies by the

[1:47:37.400 --> 1:47:42.680]  rusted cowards it doesn't mean when somebody cheats us or stabs us or as
[1:47:42.680 --> 1:47:47.120]  wicked and tries to bring us down that we don't kick them to the curb it means
[1:47:47.120 --> 1:47:51.840]  when somebody who's well-meaning but stupid does something or someone who
[1:47:51.840 --> 1:47:54.800]  isn't pure evil does something you forgive them or but your family you
[1:47:54.800 --> 1:47:59.080]  forgive them but you do not forgive the New World Order ladies and gentlemen you

[1:48:23.080 --> 1:48:27.040]  flowing through your very veins
[1:48:31.000 --> 1:48:35.480]  okay I got to get settled down thought I felt like I could take on 20 people
[1:48:35.480 --> 1:48:42.200]  right now man because I'm not doing this for nothing I'm not playing this game
[1:48:42.200 --> 1:48:52.560]  to lose I just got to turn loose that's the key turn lose stop caring what your
[1:48:52.560 --> 1:48:57.760]  cowardly neighbors think stop caring stop cowering to some cop when he tells you
[1:48:57.760 --> 1:49:01.640]  to turn your camera off when you're 50 yards away filming an arrest you tell
[1:49:01.640 --> 1:49:07.240]  them it's my first amendment stop being afraid if you're a good officer stop
[1:49:07.240 --> 1:49:14.200]  being afraid speak up I know there's good ones a lot of them out there you
[1:49:14.200 --> 1:49:16.960]  know I'm always bashing cops because it's a sick culture and the bad ones
[1:49:16.960 --> 1:49:21.200]  really stand out and make the rest of the good ones look bad but I look at the
[1:49:21.200 --> 1:49:25.320]  statistics they have had national polls of police were 98 percent or pro-second
[1:49:25.320 --> 1:49:32.040]  amendment Ron Paul got almost 80% of all the military donations to the
[1:49:32.040 --> 1:49:37.000]  Republicans so the military's good the cops are good I get threatened by police
[1:49:37.000 --> 1:49:40.320]  at a primitive level because I know my nose is clean I know I'm a good person
[1:49:40.320 --> 1:49:46.240]  I know I'm not doing anything wrong other than speeding and I know I don't
[1:49:46.240 --> 1:49:52.040]  deserve to be treated like dirt but I just want the police to know that I am
[1:49:52.040 --> 1:49:55.920]  your friend at my core and I'm just sick of you being conned just like I'm sick
[1:49:55.920 --> 1:50:00.520]  of everybody else being conned it's disgusting
[1:50:02.240 --> 1:50:07.000]  it's like watching your son get in the car with a bunch of drug addicts and you
[1:50:07.000 --> 1:50:10.440]  know he's going off to use drugs well you shouldn't be a wimp you should grab
[1:50:10.440 --> 1:50:14.600]  him out of that car not let him go and I'm not saying I see the police as my son
[1:50:14.600 --> 1:50:18.920]  but you understand I see he was being conned somebody actually care about being

[1:55:33.760 --> 1:55:42.480]  lie Hitler and go to Wikipedia and find that Hitler did not say the bigger the
[1:55:42.480 --> 1:55:46.520]  lie the easier the cell he put him on hold put him on hold I'm gonna say what
[1:55:46.520 --> 1:55:51.280]  he really said Joseph Gerbils wrote that the Soviets were liars that the
[1:55:51.280 --> 1:55:57.440]  communists were liars and that they would use the big lie the bigger the lie
[1:55:57.440 --> 1:56:00.760]  the more they believe it and then Hitler quoted that in a radio address
[1:56:00.760 --> 1:56:06.240]  talking about how they told big lies so in a way it's not true but in a way it
[1:56:06.240 --> 1:56:14.080]  is true is that correct go ahead am I back on yes you are he accused the Jews
[1:56:14.080 --> 1:56:22.880]  of using the big lie technique go also on the Internet is a Go Wolf 1934
[1:56:22.880 --> 1:56:30.200]  Nuremberg rally speech and the words in that speech are words to live by they
[1:56:30.200 --> 1:56:35.400]  are fantastic okay listen thanks for the call man I really appreciate your
[1:56:35.400 --> 1:56:42.560]  call yeah Gerbils constantly talked about the big lie and so he said it about
[1:56:42.560 --> 1:56:46.560]  communists he said about Jews and that's true I'm someone of a history above on
[1:56:46.560 --> 1:56:50.120]  the Nazis not some expert you can read a hundred books and know nothing it's a
[1:56:50.120 --> 1:56:54.680]  big piece of history but I've probably read 20 major books on it rise and fall
[1:56:54.680 --> 1:56:58.640]  the third right by sheer Heinz Hubble's order the death set these are 900 page
[1:56:58.640 --> 1:57:03.280]  books by the way and fascinating stuff that's what got me into history and I
[1:57:03.280 --> 1:57:06.840]  was a little kid I should have reading it I've read my comp my struggle I've
[1:57:06.840 --> 1:57:11.560]  read a lot more and yes you're right he also did say that about Jews but a lot
[1:57:11.560 --> 1:57:14.520]  of people then look at issues and think oh Alex is lying he said it was about
[1:57:14.520 --> 1:57:20.800]  communists it's about Jews no it's it's both Gerbils gave hundreds of big lie
[1:57:20.800 --> 1:57:28.620]  speeches and see I was correct that it is Goebbels Joseph Gerbils who gave that
[1:57:28.620 --> 1:57:36.000]  speech but Hitler also his speechwriter was Joseph Gerbils Heinrich Himmler
[1:57:36.000 --> 1:57:44.560]  actually was a little SS commander and the fat man the fat heroin addict also
[1:57:44.560 --> 1:57:51.120]  helped with some of the speeches occasionally early on Herman Goering
[1:57:51.120 --> 1:57:57.800]  okay we'll be right back now that we've had our Hitler is wonderful call and

[2:01:03.360 --> 2:01:07.680]  well there's a lot of them but go ahead no no exactly not because I just
[2:01:07.680 --> 2:01:10.560]  discovered that basically was on the news today and they were talking about
[2:01:10.560 --> 2:01:16.200]  being that that being the largest in the world basically yes and I'll just I
[2:01:16.200 --> 2:01:19.320]  thought you just mentioned the one you have been in the state which is called
[2:01:19.320 --> 2:01:24.320]  the treatment I believe was something like that yes it has name okay and I
[2:01:24.320 --> 2:01:29.760]  just wanted to to say to you that you you know when I hear you screaming and
[2:01:29.760 --> 2:01:34.040]  feeling lonely in your studio back there in the states I just want you to know
[2:01:34.040 --> 2:01:38.280]  that you're not alone there's a lot of people as you know but especially in my
[2:01:38.280 --> 2:01:44.520]  country as well in Europe that 100% agree with what you have to say and I just
[2:01:44.520 --> 2:01:47.400]  wish you could come over to Europe because you could easily do what you do
[2:01:47.400 --> 2:01:51.160]  in the streets in the states you know talking out loud the good thing is our
[2:01:51.160 --> 2:01:54.840]  government don't speak you know I mean especially our cops don't speak a word
[2:01:54.840 --> 2:01:59.480]  of English so they wouldn't know what you talk about we could create a big
[2:01:59.480 --> 2:02:05.400]  big message you know thinking if you brother believe me I'd like to hang out
[2:02:05.400 --> 2:02:09.640]  in Paris I'd like to hang out in the south of France I'd love to hang out in
[2:02:09.640 --> 2:02:14.520]  Greece and Italy I mean believe me if I had my druthers that's where I'd be
[2:02:14.520 --> 2:02:18.800]  hanging out it's beautiful it's wonderful I love it believe me someday I'm
[2:02:18.800 --> 2:02:22.600]  gonna have a European tour I've turned down probably 50 of them and I do want
[2:02:22.600 --> 2:02:25.960]  to come see everybody over there and my wife lived over there till she was like
[2:02:25.960 --> 2:02:31.280]  20 years old so believe me I want to come I've waited for 20 minutes so
[2:02:31.280 --> 2:02:34.240]  that's probably the most expensive phone call I'm gonna make I apologize go ahead
[2:02:34.240 --> 2:02:38.080]  but not all right man I just want to say one more thing you've talked about you
[2:02:38.080 --> 2:02:44.440]  know that slow frequency no zeal control system again I've talked about what you
[2:02:44.440 --> 2:02:49.600]  know the low frequency no zeal yes yes ultra low frequency control yes you
[2:02:49.600 --> 2:02:54.640]  know that that shit and in a newspaper today I saw like the equivalent but you
[2:02:54.640 --> 2:02:59.360]  know just with ultrasonic shit for kids you know against kids basically they
[2:02:59.360 --> 2:03:05.240]  saying that this is for you know for to push away kids or even people in the
[2:03:05.240 --> 2:03:10.960]  streets you know it's called the mosquito London Paris New York but ultra low
[2:03:10.960 --> 2:03:15.240]  frequency that actually damages the hearing see you lose the hearing because
[2:03:15.240 --> 2:03:20.020]  well the the the low frequency and ultra low frequency damages the delicate
[2:03:20.020 --> 2:03:26.520]  bones and so you become deaf to it generally by about 25 and yes all over
[2:03:26.520 --> 2:03:30.480]  the world they're putting in these devices just to make kids not be on the
[2:03:30.480 --> 2:03:34.200]  street you don't know why you're being why you're being irritated that's a
[2:03:34.200 --> 2:03:39.840]  mind-control weapon being introduced in plain view it is incredible but Alex
[2:03:39.840 --> 2:03:43.720]  can I just add that it I'm a musician myself yes I know about frequencies and
[2:03:43.720 --> 2:03:47.200]  I don't know if you remember but in the past like in the 70s when they had big
[2:03:47.200 --> 2:03:51.080]  concerts had all concerts people would die they wouldn't know what it would
[2:03:51.080 --> 2:03:54.240]  come from that was coming from the low-frequency not being controlled at
[2:03:54.240 --> 2:03:59.200]  the time coming from the base and the low-frequency itself can actually kill
[2:03:59.200 --> 2:04:03.760]  you it's not only mind-control or to make you feel you know no shit for
[2:04:03.760 --> 2:04:09.760]  anything like that can actually kill actually blow inside your your you told
[2:04:09.760 --> 2:04:13.640]  me all your organs and shit I had well yes I had read that and you want to
[2:04:13.640 --> 2:04:17.160]  write a blurb up you ought to post it in the prison planet forum and we'll put

[2:07:54.240 --> 2:08:03.520]  radio network all right the guy from France hung up he didn't understand me
[2:08:03.520 --> 2:08:07.520]  I wanted to hear his other point this is an example of how conditioned I have
[2:08:07.520 --> 2:08:14.000]  become I have seen articles for about five years on the mosquito that's one
[2:08:14.000 --> 2:08:20.440]  company the biggest one there's quite a few it's ultra low frequency it's like a
[2:08:20.440 --> 2:08:30.920]  do but a lot higher and it does damage the more you hear it the more you lose
[2:08:30.920 --> 2:08:34.240]  the power to hear it my grandmother always should hear dog whistles her whole
[2:08:34.240 --> 2:08:38.080]  life she's 83 now she can still hear him she's like super hearing you know some
[2:08:38.080 --> 2:08:41.160]  people have better hearing than average women on average a better hearing men on
[2:08:41.160 --> 2:08:45.400]  the average have better eyesight it's a genetic trait but I guess for survival
[2:08:45.400 --> 2:08:49.360]  but no it damages your ears and they just put them out they say we don't want
[2:08:49.360 --> 2:08:53.800]  young people on the streets of France and Paris and the New York and so it
[2:08:53.800 --> 2:08:57.800]  makes you uncomfortable but it's just don't worry adults can't hear it but
[2:08:57.800 --> 2:09:01.280]  the studies show that you're just not picking it up the bones in your ear are
[2:09:01.280 --> 2:09:06.160]  actually clattering little bitty tiny bones some of the size of hairs are
[2:09:06.160 --> 2:09:12.040]  basically in there clattering around and it's the equivalent of sirens going
[2:09:12.040 --> 2:09:17.760]  off five inches from your head but they just you just don't know it and we need
[2:09:17.760 --> 2:09:21.000]  to do an article on that because here I am for years seeing it and I never even
[2:09:21.000 --> 2:09:27.080]  mentioned it now what I did mention and put in road to tyranny was the super
[2:09:27.080 --> 2:09:33.680]  sonic nausea that will be the sonic nausea or the supersonic nausea that is
[2:09:33.680 --> 2:09:37.440]  in every major law enforcement catalog I've seen showmer tech you name it and
[2:09:37.440 --> 2:09:40.880]  they brag they say we take these two they're very small we take these two
[2:09:40.880 --> 2:09:45.840]  rallies to make everybody sick we take it to torture people in the jails look
[2:09:45.840 --> 2:09:49.960]  and it's hidden play they say that on there it's in the film we've got a
[2:09:49.960 --> 2:09:53.640]  blow-up of the catalog saying make make people nauseated to break down free
[2:09:53.640 --> 2:09:57.880]  speech rallies that's illegal just advertised as illegalities completely in
[2:09:57.880 --> 2:10:03.400]  your face it's all in plain view and it's the same thing with these mosquitoes
[2:10:03.400 --> 2:10:07.720]  they make you uncomfortable they make you nauseous and it says they use them in
[2:10:07.720 --> 2:10:14.480]  jails to torture people why would you want to do that you see we're talking
[2:10:14.480 --> 2:10:18.000]  about sending people to prison in Abu Ghraib for breaking bones but cops break
[2:10:18.000 --> 2:10:21.880]  bones here and call it paying compliance they've been doing it for 20 years I've

[2:13:18.080 --> 2:13:22.200]  open invitation to stay at my home with my family oh I love the smokies I'd lie
[2:13:22.200 --> 2:13:26.160]  my I've got a wanderlust but I can't ever do it oh it's beautiful now spring
[2:13:26.160 --> 2:13:30.320]  time all the trees are blooming and I've I've I've rock climbed and marched up
[2:13:30.320 --> 2:13:34.280]  quite a few of your hills quite a few of your mountains I love the snow on the
[2:13:34.280 --> 2:13:37.840]  ground the pine trees and you come up out of the clouds on a spire of a
[2:13:37.840 --> 2:13:42.320]  mountain and you're overlooking the smokies oh my gosh it sounds like you've
[2:13:42.320 --> 2:13:45.840]  been here pull out that thermos of coffee out of your backpack you just walk
[2:13:45.840 --> 2:13:49.760]  you know eight miles up the mountain you just drink that delicious coffee up
[2:13:49.760 --> 2:13:53.440]  there nothing better you're next to heaven that's for sure I wouldn't I
[2:13:53.440 --> 2:13:57.880]  wanted to ask you about a pre-91 they were talking about this yellow cake
[2:13:57.880 --> 2:14:02.240]  from Niger do you think it could be possible you know they use this in
[2:14:02.240 --> 2:14:06.560]  replace of sulfur in the thermate if they say use something subnuclear or
[2:14:06.560 --> 2:14:10.560]  subatomic would it would it be able to pulverize the Thomas eyes all the
[2:14:10.560 --> 2:14:13.600]  steel and the concrete you know I'm not an engineer a physicist the
[2:14:13.600 --> 2:14:17.240]  demolitions expert but I don't think they'd use masses of isotopes because
[2:14:17.240 --> 2:14:20.920]  they would want to pick up you have it be picked up the problem is major
[2:14:20.920 --> 2:14:25.040]  British scientists and others major institutions have found really high
[2:14:25.040 --> 2:14:29.160]  levels of different isotopes at the towers that can't be explained that's
[2:14:29.160 --> 2:14:32.480]  one of the things I thought the satellites picked up some radio activities
[2:14:32.480 --> 2:14:38.240]  and they didn't report on it much but in and in one of the cryton books it
[2:14:38.240 --> 2:14:43.880]  talks about the sub frequency machine that could also vibrate you know
[2:14:43.880 --> 2:14:50.400]  you almost like to melt the you know the government's develop those and some
[2:14:50.400 --> 2:14:53.600]  people want to say that that's what knocked the buildings down it's just
[2:14:53.600 --> 2:14:59.000]  that is political sepaku to come out and say that plus I don't believe
[2:14:59.000 --> 2:15:04.560]  particle beams did it yeah and and it appears to be conventional high-powered
[2:15:04.560 --> 2:15:09.200]  explosives but way overloaded like Jesse Ventura said where they just put two
[2:15:09.200 --> 2:15:15.080]  three times what was needed that's tower one and two seven is a conventional
[2:15:15.080 --> 2:15:19.560]  exactly I mean it makes you wonder about you know people who can't believe
[2:15:19.560 --> 2:15:24.520]  what their own I see and when I bring up a lot of people around here and you
[2:15:24.520 --> 2:15:27.960]  know they come up with all these issues what can't you believe what you see I
[2:15:27.960 --> 2:15:32.120]  mean where are you at in your life that you're going to not what your own I see
[2:15:32.120 --> 2:15:38.040]  but I really admire your show and appreciate all you do absolutely my
[2:15:38.040 --> 2:15:44.360]  friend thank you for calling oh before I forget just remind me caller so I'm gonna
[2:15:44.360 --> 2:15:47.520]  get to it later and so I have time to talk to all the calls we've been
[2:15:47.520 --> 2:15:52.920]  censored again well that radio blogger site openly tells people we're banned
[2:15:52.920 --> 2:15:56.840]  all 9-11 truth is banned they say it's all lies they just say we say you're a
[2:15:56.840 --> 2:16:02.000]  liar the world is flat you're banned but AOL social networking site put out an
[2:16:02.000 --> 2:16:08.600]  official statement saying prison planet is banned and that was a story yesterday
[2:16:08.600 --> 2:16:13.760]  up on prisonplanet.com people tell us that libraries all over the country say
[2:16:13.760 --> 2:16:17.600]  we're banned we know it's been in the news for years it's been admitted that
[2:16:17.600 --> 2:16:23.520]  info wars and prison planet are in the list of bands software that is libraries
[2:16:23.520 --> 2:16:30.920]  corporations schools universities institutions by filtering software and
[2:16:30.920 --> 2:16:36.440]  it advertises filters out porn filters out hate filters out gambling filters out
[2:16:36.440 --> 2:16:44.000]  hacking those are the four big genres that are filtered and what do you want to
[2:16:44.000 --> 2:16:52.120]  guess is in hacking and hate but info wars.com and prison planet.com and then
[2:16:52.120 --> 2:16:55.280]  we can start a new website and it can suddenly get on all the other big sites
[2:16:55.280 --> 2:16:58.360]  and get a lot of traffic and then in about six months to a year the new
[2:16:58.360 --> 2:17:03.200]  version comes out and baby they're on it another reason I've started more sites
[2:17:03.200 --> 2:17:07.760]  and this is internet too where they just wall you off for more and more more
[2:17:07.760 --> 2:17:12.520]  and more major platforms it's been admitted that Comcast has filtered us
[2:17:12.520 --> 2:17:16.600]  out British telecoms though they stopped doing it because they filtered a bunch
[2:17:16.600 --> 2:17:19.720]  people and got in trouble a bunch of different British telecoms have done
[2:17:19.720 --> 2:17:27.760]  it so we are filtered out all over the place info wars.com and prison
[2:17:27.760 --> 2:17:32.360]  planet.com or websites they don't want you to get to try truth news.us try
[2:17:32.360 --> 2:17:40.040]  rompaulwaroom.com try marshallaw911.info try Arnold exposed I think the
[2:17:40.040 --> 2:17:44.760]  answer is every year have a new mirror site for each site and have my web
[2:17:44.760 --> 2:17:53.160]  masters upload to the mirror for that year and then in a year discharge that
[2:17:53.160 --> 2:17:56.880]  website I just don't have the money for employees and extra IT folks already
[2:17:56.880 --> 2:18:00.640]  worked to the bone so buy some videos from me because of the capital comes in
[2:18:00.640 --> 2:18:04.600]  we'll just hire more people I mean we have to we're fighting we'd rather have
[2:18:04.600 --> 2:18:08.000]  you put pressure on the companies and but it's just getting to where he sets a
[2:18:08.000 --> 2:18:11.760]  censorship works you complain about one you fight another you fight you fight and
[2:18:11.760 --> 2:18:18.040]  pretty soon it's kind of like RFID adoption in all products Walmart and the
[2:18:18.040 --> 2:18:21.920]  Defense Department order all their suppliers in 2000 to have it in by 2004
[2:18:21.920 --> 2:18:24.920]  they fail but they're now set new deadlines for the end of this year most
[2:18:24.920 --> 2:18:30.280]  companies have now complied so early on we could protest Proctor and Gamble or
[2:18:30.280 --> 2:18:35.840]  Gillette or Michelin Campbell's but now we just can't because once it's
[2:18:35.840 --> 2:18:39.280]  universal and they talk about that it's like thumb scanners we've been
[2:18:39.280 --> 2:18:43.440]  protesting and fighting it thumb scanners in the school lunches thumb
[2:18:43.440 --> 2:18:46.600]  scanners in the grocery stores thumb scanners at the mega churches thumb
[2:18:46.600 --> 2:18:52.080]  scanners to get into work once you get massive implementation it's almost
[2:18:52.080 --> 2:18:56.820]  impossible to reverse it it makes it 100 times harder we're now reaching 20 30
[2:18:56.820 --> 2:19:00.200]  percent depending on whose survey you look at but a large portion of the US
[2:19:00.200 --> 2:19:07.760]  now has these integrated you understand folks so they're integrating total
[2:19:07.760 --> 2:19:11.760]  censorship of info wars and present planet right now that's why we need you
[2:19:11.760 --> 2:19:14.920]  to tell your friends and family about the sites we need you to spread the word
[2:19:14.920 --> 2:19:19.880]  about them or we won't be here you know they'll come a day where it's very hard
[2:19:19.880 --> 2:19:25.440]  to get to our sites and we're very hard to find us we'll be walled off
[2:19:25.440 --> 2:19:31.440]  everywhere they're trying to kill the viral nature of our information warfare
[2:19:31.440 --> 2:19:37.600]  frequency they're trying to block it and you bet they better block it because
[2:19:37.600 --> 2:19:40.800]  we're like a virus that's going to bring down their system but we're a virus
[2:19:40.800 --> 2:19:43.880]  that gives life we're actually an antibiotic that's blocking their
[2:19:43.880 --> 2:19:49.840]  bacterial infection so they're trying to create a toxin to block us it is a big
[2:19:49.840 --> 2:19:57.240]  idea a new world order in the near future earth is dominated by a powerful
[2:19:57.240 --> 2:20:02.720]  government it's known as the builder bird but their objective being world
[2:20:02.720 --> 2:20:08.360]  domination for thousands of years their dark order grew now as they hail the
[2:20:08.360 --> 2:20:13.880]  birth of the new world order their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity
[2:20:13.880 --> 2:20:20.720]  is at hand for the first time in history the elite's plan for world
[2:20:20.720 --> 2:20:25.120]  government is blown wide open you will learn the secret that drives the entire

[2:24:07.440 --> 2:24:24.040]  see if I still feel I focus on the pain the only thing that's really the needle
[2:24:24.040 --> 2:24:40.080]  tears the hole the old familiar sting try to kill it all away but I remember
[2:24:40.080 --> 2:24:48.480]  everything all right John and Wyoming thanks for holding on the air I have it
[2:24:48.480 --> 2:24:53.120]  yes yeah there was something in the local paper here in Cheyenne the Wyoming
[2:24:53.120 --> 2:24:58.640]  Tribune Eagle on March 16 2008 and the headline reads super computer awaiting
[2:24:58.640 --> 2:25:02.680]  approval what they're doing is the National Science Foundation and has to
[2:25:02.680 --> 2:25:06.600]  authorize a super computer facility which will be located here in Cheyenne
[2:25:06.600 --> 2:25:12.120]  Wyoming now what they're claiming is they're going to use it to predict the
[2:25:12.120 --> 2:25:16.680]  path of hurricanes and tornadoes to gauge the need for evacuations as well as
[2:25:16.680 --> 2:25:20.760]  examining air pollution and drought conditions to make informed economic
[2:25:20.760 --> 2:25:25.040]  decisions however you and I know what the government usually does with their
[2:25:25.040 --> 2:25:29.640]  super it's all part of the all part of the server in the sky each person in the
[2:25:29.640 --> 2:25:34.560]  Pentagon and the FBI is involved in it in the world now has a simulated
[2:25:34.560 --> 2:25:38.480]  individual that all your data all your mining and that's the next new story I'm
[2:25:38.480 --> 2:25:44.160]  going to cover is put into and then they can also say oh the computer says you
[2:25:44.160 --> 2:25:48.480]  have to evacuate the computer says you got to hand your guns in it's the new
[2:25:48.480 --> 2:25:53.560]  expert yeah well another thing to let me bring up another point now you and I
[2:25:53.560 --> 2:25:57.960]  know that your good friend George Norrie is a wonderful guy he's a patriot and
[2:25:57.960 --> 2:26:02.880]  all of that but his producer and his phone screeners are ringers believe me
[2:26:02.880 --> 2:26:07.040]  because when you were on in the last time I don't know if you remember me
[2:26:07.040 --> 2:26:10.960]  calling in whenever you were on not the last time but the time before everything
[2:26:10.960 --> 2:26:16.040]  went hunky dory but when you were on Alex's I mean George's program again and
[2:26:16.040 --> 2:26:20.600]  I tried to call through they wouldn't even pick up my phone and when Tom
[2:26:20.600 --> 2:26:25.400]  Danhauser used to answer the phones I would call through and he would put me
[2:26:25.400 --> 2:26:29.160]  on hold and then he'd cut me off a few seconds later and I did this five six
[2:26:29.160 --> 2:26:32.960]  times in a row and he claimed that all he was having problems with the phone
[2:26:32.960 --> 2:26:38.880]  service when in fact he kept telling people to call in and everybody else's
[2:26:38.880 --> 2:26:42.880]  call got through but mine he would keep cutting off every time I would cut
[2:26:42.880 --> 2:26:46.320]  through well look I mean I mean Tom's really nice guy to me and so is George
[2:26:46.320 --> 2:26:49.080]  and I'm personal friends with them and I've gotten to know them they're nothing
[2:26:49.080 --> 2:26:52.840]  but sweethearts to me and I've been in studio while they're taking calls and
[2:26:52.840 --> 2:26:55.920]  most of the time they just get your name and where you're calling from and
[2:26:55.920 --> 2:26:59.640]  sometimes not even that but Liz so I really I mean it's pointless for me to
[2:26:59.640 --> 2:27:03.720]  just come on and bash them you know yeah but I mean they won't even pick up my
[2:27:03.720 --> 2:27:07.640]  call now whenever you have Ron Paul on there is a guest because I've been a
[2:27:07.640 --> 2:27:12.000]  personal friend of Ron since 1972 how do you know they don't have caller ID on
[2:27:12.000 --> 2:27:16.640]  those phones I don't know but it doesn't get through they won't pick it up and
[2:27:16.640 --> 2:27:21.520]  when I was calling in and Tom was answering the telephones he would hang
[2:27:21.520 --> 2:27:25.560]  up on me and so I don't know why okay well listen I appreciate your call sir I
[2:27:25.560 --> 2:27:29.840]  just can't help you that's another radio show and I don't know I've been in
[2:27:29.840 --> 2:27:35.720]  studio with George three times I guess for a total of about nine hours I've been
[2:27:35.720 --> 2:27:41.840]  out to eat with him a few times I've been to Vince he's invited me to and that's
[2:27:41.840 --> 2:27:48.320]  it I mean I just these shows are these calls aren't screened here you can call
[2:27:48.320 --> 2:27:52.960]  in call in talk about other shows calls answers I don't know I'm not trying to
[2:27:52.960 --> 2:27:56.520]  get in a fight with you sir it just really isn't news here I mean when we
[2:27:56.520 --> 2:28:00.000]  to bash him I just I need to go on that show and reach people they've never
[2:28:00.000 --> 2:28:04.400]  censored me I know that and I'm pretty radical folks they've never told me what
[2:28:04.400 --> 2:28:11.760]  I can talk about on that show now they do research what you claim first time
[2:28:11.760 --> 2:28:17.920]  I went on there they just said okay what are your 20 questions and then they
[2:28:17.920 --> 2:28:20.840]  went and actually I later found out went research each and every one of them to
[2:28:20.840 --> 2:28:25.360]  find out it wasn't slander or liable so they do do their research that's why you
[2:28:25.360 --> 2:28:29.480]  hear me on that show because they know I'm covering something that's from a
[2:28:29.480 --> 2:28:36.880]  source they have they see they they either care cover fun things as George
[2:28:36.880 --> 2:28:40.880]  calls it you know pyramid shows Atlanta shows it's interesting it's entertaining
[2:28:40.880 --> 2:28:44.760]  ghost shows I mean I listened to those I'm sometimes myself sick of the New
[2:28:44.760 --> 2:28:47.680]  World order stuff so we drive along listening to the funny ghost stories you
[2:28:47.680 --> 2:28:54.680]  know I'm looking behind me in the seat at midnight and driving home but you know
[2:28:54.680 --> 2:28:57.160]  I've been working till midnight on the New World order I want to hear something
[2:28:57.160 --> 2:29:00.200]  else driving home for 30 minutes that's kind of like my vacation of my rest each
[2:29:00.200 --> 2:29:06.800]  day and but then when they do serious shows you know they got to be careful
[2:29:06.800 --> 2:29:13.640]  because and they do that by trying to have people on who have credibility but
[2:29:13.640 --> 2:29:17.200]  they've never censored me they're great folks okay I got to one call in that five

[2:32:49.800 --> 2:33:11.320]  Hi let's dispense with the pleasant fish and let's come back and go to your
[2:33:11.320 --> 2:33:16.000]  coals Rocco in North Carolina you're on the air thanks for holding hello yes
[2:33:16.000 --> 2:33:22.720]  sir hi Alex my question was about world net deli and Joseph Ferrar at first I
[2:33:22.720 --> 2:33:26.320]  didn't believe when you said certain people were agents but yeah it appears
[2:33:26.320 --> 2:33:32.160]  you're right about Savage what's your take on him well I mean Savage is
[2:33:32.160 --> 2:33:36.480]  saying George Bush is fighting the New World Order but I remember I mean I'm
[2:33:36.480 --> 2:33:40.080]  giving you my example of why Savage is a fake conservative like I'm not gonna get
[2:33:40.080 --> 2:33:44.200]  into a bashing contest with Farrah they've done a lot of good they were
[2:33:44.200 --> 2:33:47.840]  there at the start of the web and really taught me a lot and published a lot of
[2:33:47.840 --> 2:33:52.520]  stories I put together and photos I published and then when Bush got in and
[2:33:52.520 --> 2:33:57.360]  9-11 happened they were really shifted and and you can see their numbers they
[2:33:57.360 --> 2:34:01.880]  destroyed themselves to a great extent you know they're still a big force but
[2:34:01.880 --> 2:34:06.920]  really it's sad and I don't think Joseph Ferrar is an agent I know Terry Reed the
[2:34:06.920 --> 2:34:11.360]  former CIA officer exposed government drug dealing by Clinton and Bush runs
[2:34:11.360 --> 2:34:17.080]  their shipping department out of Kansas City and listens to the show so I know
[2:34:17.080 --> 2:34:22.560]  people inside the organization are patriots I just think that the Farrah
[2:34:22.560 --> 2:34:27.760]  really felt Farrah's Lebanese Christian and boy they hate Arabs like nothing
[2:34:27.760 --> 2:34:31.720]  you've ever seen Muslim Arabs and so I just think it's Joseph Farrah is a
[2:34:31.720 --> 2:34:35.080]  Lebanese Christian and I think he genuinely believes the stuff he puts
[2:34:35.080 --> 2:34:40.760]  up yeah with 9-11 yeah they did completely blocked out any debate and I
[2:34:40.760 --> 2:34:44.480]  think that's part of the reason why DV kid isn't yeah it doesn't right for me
[2:34:44.480 --> 2:34:51.080]  anymore yeah I think world that daily still it's a lot better than the New
[2:34:51.080 --> 2:34:54.280]  York Times a lot better than the Washington Post I mean some articles
[2:34:54.280 --> 2:34:59.440]  about them grabbing homeschool kids or the Second Amendment dead on I mean
[2:34:59.440 --> 2:35:03.360]  they've got tons of quarter they fight the North American Union and they're
[2:35:03.360 --> 2:35:07.560]  getting better I mean I think they drank the Kool-Aid in 2001 and they stopped
[2:35:07.560 --> 2:35:12.360]  drinking in about a year ago to a certain extent thanks Alex do you have any
[2:35:12.360 --> 2:35:17.040]  plans of doing the documentary just on media manipulation I would love to yes
[2:35:17.040 --> 2:35:22.000]  and I've meant to I just can't I can't do it all but that is on the front
[2:35:22.000 --> 2:35:26.520]  burner to try to do something like that I appreciate your call really good
[2:35:26.520 --> 2:35:34.200]  questions Rocco not only ask great questions got a cool name Rocco let's
[2:35:34.200 --> 2:35:39.120]  go ahead and talk to John in Tennessee John you're on the air welcome hey Alex
[2:35:39.120 --> 2:35:44.320]  last time I talked to you I'm a marine and we talked the gentleman from the
[2:35:44.320 --> 2:35:48.680]  coordination was only talked about the guy who I think killed the puppy was
[2:35:48.680 --> 2:35:53.640]  doing some stuff like that and we spoke about how a lot of these Marines and
[2:35:53.640 --> 2:35:58.320]  soldiers and guys coming back we're fighting and I've seen it myself or
[2:35:58.320 --> 2:36:05.880]  we've been trained we've been led to some stuff that that's pro-martial law but
[2:36:05.880 --> 2:36:09.600]  I don't want to talk about that today what I want to talk about it is to these
[2:36:09.600 --> 2:36:14.560]  people to these intelligence officers listen to the to these to these
[2:36:14.560 --> 2:36:19.360]  sergeants to staff sergeants stuff and say you know to the guy that call in and
[2:36:19.360 --> 2:36:23.920]  threaten you or call you on the phone I know guys like this and I want to tell
[2:36:23.920 --> 2:36:28.560]  them their jokes that they're worthless as clown shoes you know they're pointless
[2:36:28.560 --> 2:36:33.200]  they're getting trinkets like little whores it just really upset me but
[2:36:33.200 --> 2:36:38.920]  they're going to lose the meek will inherit the earth and really I've been
[2:36:38.920 --> 2:36:42.720]  really down above economic news lately but just hearing Jesse Ventura calling
[2:36:42.720 --> 2:36:48.440]  got me going you know I'd really I had a question for you about the scientific
[2:36:48.440 --> 2:36:51.560]  dictatorship you said you read it and I just really think in games really
[2:36:51.560 --> 2:36:55.040]  comparable to that now the the ascendancy of the scientific dictatorship I
[2:36:55.040 --> 2:36:58.200]  recommend that people read it and that I was wondering if you've ever had the
[2:36:58.200 --> 2:37:02.920]  Collins brothers on who wrote it or if you plan to have no I need to have them
[2:37:02.920 --> 2:37:07.440]  on that's a good idea the Collins brothers the ascendancy of the scientific
[2:37:07.440 --> 2:37:12.360]  dictatorship we'll try to do that but I just want to say you have more spirit
[2:37:12.360 --> 2:37:17.160]  of the Marine Corps like Chessie puller Smedley Butler than all these guys well
[2:37:17.160 --> 2:37:23.280]  we're down with New World Order and as a disabled veteran who's dying I just
[2:37:23.280 --> 2:37:26.440]  want to tell you you know when you have everything to lose you have nothing to
[2:37:26.440 --> 2:37:31.080]  lose so let's stand up let's fight this the feds the New World Order they have
[2:37:31.080 --> 2:37:34.360]  nothing against us well God bless you my friend and I really appreciate your
[2:37:34.360 --> 2:37:37.920]  spirit listen I don't claim to be the toughest guy around and I don't claim
[2:37:37.920 --> 2:37:41.120]  be able to march with a hundred pound pack to the desert so I'm not a tough
[2:37:41.120 --> 2:37:46.520]  guy but I know this if you're trying to bring me down and it doesn't matter I
[2:37:46.520 --> 2:37:50.840]  mean if you got me I'm gonna be biting your heels I mean it's really that simple
[2:37:50.840 --> 2:37:56.080]  and to me it's it's not being a tough guy it's who I am I am gonna fight you
[2:37:56.080 --> 2:38:01.440]  and I'm not gonna get into yeah cuz I can't I mean it's not even a question of
[2:38:01.440 --> 2:38:07.040]  courage these people are killers they're scum their filth their trash and I look
[2:38:07.040 --> 2:38:11.360]  at the little people the children the women we have to fight this evil for
[2:38:11.360 --> 2:38:17.040]  them that's what it is to be a man and I appreciate you sir but you know I act
[2:38:17.040 --> 2:38:22.080]  like a fool sometimes I go and scream I am a nut I'm a nut that's part of me but
[2:38:22.080 --> 2:38:25.200]  I also am intelligent at other levels you know I'm a multifaceted person like
[2:38:25.200 --> 2:38:30.640]  everybody I'm an intellectual I researched things I study science but
[2:38:30.640 --> 2:38:35.520]  then I get on air and I start thinking about it and I just go crazy because at
[2:38:35.520 --> 2:38:44.480]  my core that's who I am I'm just a wild dog basically and I just know there's a
[2:38:44.480 --> 2:38:47.280]  bunch of scientific freaks running everything and they think we're all a
[2:38:47.280 --> 2:38:50.400]  bunch of idiots who deserve to be slaves and I don't want to be a slave and I
[2:38:50.400 --> 2:38:53.560]  don't want my family being hurt and I don't want your family being hurt and I
[2:38:53.560 --> 2:38:56.880]  know that none of us are safe till we bring down this new world order that's
[2:38:56.880 --> 2:39:01.560]  all I know I know I didn't ask for this fight
[2:39:01.560 --> 2:39:06.520]  now that we're not looking for a fight I don't want to fight I want to go just
[2:39:06.520 --> 2:39:11.240]  live my life but they don't stop they draw first blood on us over and over and
[2:39:11.240 --> 2:39:15.560]  over again they keep pushing us and shoving us and asking for it and they're
[2:39:15.560 --> 2:39:19.760]  going to get it and they know that that's why they're trying to get their
[2:39:19.760 --> 2:39:23.320]  control grid in place and they got so many well-meaning people I mean these
[2:39:23.320 --> 2:39:27.560]  guys with the turn them into a glass parking lot terrorists hunting licenses
[2:39:27.560 --> 2:39:31.320]  on their cars you meet that guy he's the nicest guy in the world he'll come over
[2:39:31.320 --> 2:39:36.240]  and help you paint your house he'll water your yard for you he's a fun guy to go
[2:39:36.240 --> 2:39:42.360]  fishing with but he is weak-minded when it comes to being able to face that he's
[2:39:42.360 --> 2:39:49.120]  been used he's got the courage to run up a hillside towards a foxhole but does
[2:39:49.120 --> 2:39:57.840]  he have the moral courage to admit the larger issues let's go ahead and take
[2:39:57.840 --> 2:40:02.480]  another call here Dan in North Carolina you're on the air hey Alex how's it going
[2:40:02.480 --> 2:40:07.200]  good hey I'm usually become a hero in mind the past month I'm actually surprised
[2:40:07.200 --> 2:40:12.320]  that you haven't been assassinated yet but I had a question about um okay when
[2:40:12.320 --> 2:40:16.080]  that Jesse Ventura was on earlier he said that he was surprised that Obama
[2:40:16.080 --> 2:40:19.800]  has been assassinated or he will be assassinated but isn't Obama also a
[2:40:19.800 --> 2:40:25.960]  part of the CFR so isn't he trying to further the the New World Order himself
[2:40:25.960 --> 2:40:29.920]  yes but he's saying he's anti-war and I think Ventura is saying that if he
[2:40:29.920 --> 2:40:34.960]  really tries to get us out of that war with the hundreds of billions every
[2:40:34.960 --> 2:40:38.360]  few months and no bid contracts they'll kill him in a minute see it's not about
[2:40:38.360 --> 2:40:41.920]  being patriotic it's not about fighting al-qaeda it's about a bunch of old dirt
[2:40:41.920 --> 2:40:47.200]  bags making money while our patriotic men go off and die
[2:40:47.200 --> 2:40:51.320]  absolutely yeah and I think that will be there is for as long as they want us
[2:40:51.320 --> 2:40:55.480]  there well I know this there are a lot of racist who are gonna do everything they
[2:40:55.480 --> 2:40:59.760]  can to kill Obama so if he becomes president he better have so much secure
[2:40:59.760 --> 2:41:03.480]  and there's a lot of nutty black groups too you know the government will probably
[2:41:03.480 --> 2:41:08.240]  hire a black group to kill them like they did Malcolm X I mean there's just no
[2:41:08.240 --> 2:41:12.120]  end to it I appreciate your call we got to move quick here Rachel in Pennsylvania
[2:41:12.120 --> 2:41:19.000]  you're on the air big guy how are you big guy big guy big potbelly right I was
[2:41:19.000 --> 2:41:24.200]  at the store they were doing in the middle of doing their inventory they
[2:41:24.200 --> 2:41:28.200]  were not only messing around with the food but now they got certain things in
[2:41:28.200 --> 2:41:33.480]  there that is no longer in stock can't get it won't get it you were right and
[2:41:33.480 --> 2:41:37.400]  we're right in the middle of the depression and I told people and I told
[2:41:37.400 --> 2:41:41.640]  my family and I'm hoping that they're listening to you you're absolutely right
[2:41:41.640 --> 2:41:46.040]  and keep up the good work and I'm ready well thank you Rachel let me just be
[2:41:46.040 --> 2:41:53.480]  clear I've had guests on and sponsors on that thing that said a year ago we were
[2:41:53.480 --> 2:41:56.600]  gonna run out of food and now some stuff's running out and I hope they're
[2:41:56.600 --> 2:42:05.360]  wrong okay believe me I'm not sitting people email me and accuse me of wanting
[2:42:05.360 --> 2:42:12.320]  all this to happen so I can be right this is scary I live here too I don't
[2:42:12.320 --> 2:42:16.040]  want any of this to be true but there's a very good chance we're gonna have a
[2:42:16.040 --> 2:42:20.440]  war in the streets depression that's the fundamentals of the economics if it's
[2:42:20.440 --> 2:42:26.280]  some long horrible recession I'm gonna be happy as a pig in the mud
[2:42:27.120 --> 2:42:33.680]  talk about a lesser or two evils that's one I'll take but yeah there's all
[2:42:33.680 --> 2:42:38.480]  sorts of food shortage is starting up I just you wait till the people find out
[2:42:38.480 --> 2:42:41.560]  they've had their dollar devalued and now the federal reserves and take over all
[2:42:41.560 --> 2:42:45.560]  the regulatory agencies I mean it's incredible we're about 15 oh you're
[2:42:45.560 --> 2:42:50.200]  still there go ahead and Goldman Sachs is down the tank too and my folks used to
[2:42:50.200 --> 2:42:55.040]  take an invest with all this stuff they were alive today to be looked out I hear
[2:42:55.040 --> 2:43:01.000]  you and I appreciate your call one last call Aaron in California go ahead yeah
[2:43:01.000 --> 2:43:08.680]  Alex yes sir how are you good I've been listening to you I'd say late 90s and
[2:43:08.680 --> 2:43:12.560]  I've been finding out a lot about the government through my dad's sources he's
[2:43:12.560 --> 2:43:18.040]  kind of an entertainment guy in the LA and I'm just completely disgusted with
[2:43:18.040 --> 2:43:21.440]  this entire country but to start off simple what kind of water is safe to
[2:43:21.440 --> 2:43:27.200]  drink I don't have the filter well most filters just cut out some of the dead
[2:43:27.200 --> 2:43:32.720]  bacteria some of the larger molecules some of the herbicides pesticides things
[2:43:32.720 --> 2:43:36.640]  like sodium fluoride and other things go right through it even with a high
[2:43:36.640 --> 2:43:41.200]  quality I personally like I got to say I like the British Berkey the Berkey folks
[2:43:41.200 --> 2:43:43.920]  sell they're the national distributor the black one's good too but I've had it
[2:43:43.920 --> 2:43:47.360]  for you those are portable right you can take you have four yeah but but but yes
[2:43:47.360 --> 2:43:52.600]  but you got to add a fluoride filter to it and then it only gets like 98% out I
[2:43:52.600 --> 2:43:57.880]  mean fluoride is one of the smallest hardest to filter particles it's just
[2:43:57.880 --> 2:44:03.400]  unbelievable and what a bottle as far as bottle water what's good I mean there's
[2:44:03.400 --> 2:44:08.960]  no bar there are there are reverse osmosis and then I've talked to water
[2:44:08.960 --> 2:44:14.000]  experts even work for companies they say even better is the distilled there's
[2:44:14.000 --> 2:44:20.640]  companies you can get where they ship it to you the big bottles but you know I
[2:44:20.640 --> 2:44:24.080]  tend to not even care about myself so I just I still drink tea and stuff that's
[2:44:24.080 --> 2:44:27.160]  got fluoride in it because I'm habitualized to slavery but with my
[2:44:27.160 --> 2:44:30.680]  children I'm more neurotic about it we take bottles of water places and my
[2:44:30.680 --> 2:44:36.160]  bottles it's bottles of reverse osmosis put through a Berkey you know we do
[2:44:36.160 --> 2:44:40.640]  things like that then we cook with a reverse osmosis because the the the the
[2:44:40.640 --> 2:44:44.800]  fluoride has a bigger effect on their growing brains got a jump thanks for
[2:44:44.800 --> 2:44:48.480]  the call call me back as you calls are all so great and I want to hear from you

[2:47:45.360 --> 2:47:48.040]  you're saying food prices are up because we've kicked illegals out there's
[2:47:48.040 --> 2:47:53.080]  record illegals the food prices are up because of shortages 80% of the country

[2:53:50.920 --> 2:53:55.960]  All right, it's the final segment. Huge newsmaking interview with Jesse Ventura.
[2:53:55.960 --> 2:53:59.280]  He came out and said he thinks they'll probably assassinate a Barack Obama. He
[2:53:59.280 --> 2:54:03.040]  went totally public, said he believes 9-11's a total inside job, not just that
[2:54:03.040 --> 2:54:06.160]  Bin Laden was involved, but the government was involved. Now he just says the
[2:54:06.160 --> 2:54:09.920]  government did it, he's researched it. He also talked about how he was censored by
[2:54:09.920 --> 2:54:15.960]  MSNBC and how his book was censored by 20-plus publishers. He was on at the very
[2:54:15.960 --> 2:54:22.320]  start of the show. He came in hot. We call that coming in hot in radio, military
[2:54:22.320 --> 2:54:26.600]  term, I mean just coming in with your big guess immediately. We're gonna play
[2:54:26.600 --> 2:54:30.200]  like three minutes here at the end of some of his 9-11 comments. He said a lot
[2:54:30.200 --> 2:54:34.040]  more. He talked about it for 15 minutes. That is coming up right now. We're gonna
[2:54:34.040 --> 2:54:37.200]  play a few minutes from the interview. Then the show's gonna end. You got to go
[2:54:37.200 --> 2:54:41.880]  to infowars.com to those streams. You got to go to infowars.com. We
[2:54:41.880 --> 2:54:45.680]  re-stream, re-loop the show. And then there'll be articles by Paul Watson and
[2:54:45.680 --> 2:54:49.000]  Kurt Nemo. Get them out to everybody. They're up there right now. We'll be right
[2:54:49.000 --> 2:54:53.040]  back. God bless you all. Governor Ventura, you've got the floor. Give us your take
[2:54:53.040 --> 2:54:58.240]  on 9-11. Well, first of all, Alex, let me state this, you know, being ex-military
[2:54:58.240 --> 2:55:03.240]  when the attack initially took place and I was governor, I went on a very focused
[2:55:03.240 --> 2:55:07.280]  tunnel vision mode that our country had been attacked and what the hell do we need
[2:55:07.280 --> 2:55:13.160]  to do to repel it. So I today take myself because at that point in time I had a
[2:55:13.160 --> 2:55:19.240]  position of power and if I would have, you know, not been the way I was, the way
[2:55:19.240 --> 2:55:24.680]  all of us were so shocked when it happened that in that position of power
[2:55:24.680 --> 2:55:29.040]  I could have raised a lot more questions at that time about the things that went
[2:55:29.040 --> 2:55:33.640]  down that day and where today when I raised those questions naturally it
[2:55:33.640 --> 2:55:38.360]  doesn't quite have the impact that it would have had back then. But to me it's
[2:55:38.360 --> 2:55:42.920]  questions that are not being answered and haven't been answered about 9-11. And
[2:55:42.920 --> 2:55:49.640]  you know, first and foremost I think is the fact that, okay, in New York City and
[2:55:49.640 --> 2:55:54.640]  Manhattan, two planes struck two buildings. We'll all be in agreement on
[2:55:54.640 --> 2:56:00.600]  that, I think. But how is it that a third building fell five hours later? You know
[2:56:00.600 --> 2:56:05.160]  what they call World Trade Center Building number seven and for people that
[2:56:05.160 --> 2:56:10.200]  think, well, it was just a smaller building. It was 51 stories high, which of
[2:56:10.200 --> 2:56:14.320]  course in Manhattan probably isn't that big of a building, but if you were to
[2:56:14.320 --> 2:56:19.000]  move that building to Austin, Texas, or to Minneapolis, Minnesota, it would be a
[2:56:19.000 --> 2:56:22.880]  huge building. How could this building just implode into its own
[2:56:22.880 --> 2:56:28.640]  footprint five hours later? That's my first question. The 9-11 Commission never
[2:56:28.640 --> 2:56:33.320]  even brought it up. They didn't devote even one page to that in their big
[2:56:33.320 --> 2:56:39.840]  volume of investigation. Number two, how could those buildings fell at the speed
[2:56:39.840 --> 2:56:45.240]  of gravity? You know, if you put a stopwatch on them, both of those World
[2:56:45.240 --> 2:56:50.840]  Trade Center buildings were on the ground in 10 seconds. How can that be? If you
[2:56:50.840 --> 2:56:55.200]  took a billiard ball and dropped it from the height of the World Trade Center in
[2:56:55.200 --> 2:57:00.280]  a vacuum, it would hit the ground in 9.3 seconds. And if you took that same
[2:57:00.280 --> 2:57:05.840]  billiard ball and dropped it 10 stories at a time and merely stopped it and
[2:57:05.840 --> 2:57:11.000]  started it, it would take 30 seconds. If you dropped it every floor of the World
[2:57:11.000 --> 2:57:15.320]  Trade Center to the ground, simply stopping and starting it on gravity, it
[2:57:15.320 --> 2:57:20.080]  would take over 100 seconds to reach the ground. Amazing. And yet they're
[2:57:20.080 --> 2:57:25.160]  telling us that, and I could go on now after studying it, the planes hit the
[2:57:25.160 --> 2:57:32.160]  building, okay. Jet fuel is 4-5th kerosene, which is not a hot burning
[2:57:32.160 --> 2:57:37.200]  fuel. And they want us to believe that it melted these steel-structured gurgers
[2:57:37.200 --> 2:57:42.240]  and caused these buildings to pancake collapse to the ground. I was on the
[2:57:42.240 --> 2:57:46.080]  site within two weeks after it happened and I saw none of these pancakes.
[2:57:46.080 --> 2:57:50.640]  Wouldn't they all be piled up in a huge mass on the ground? And yet everything
[2:57:50.640 --> 2:57:58.120]  was blown into dust. Erasalized. You know, and when you look at it from that
[2:57:58.120 --> 2:58:03.640]  aspect, none of it makes any sense. If you apply common sense again to it, it
[2:58:03.640 --> 2:58:08.920]  does not make any sense. Never before in the annals of history has a fire caused
[2:58:08.920 --> 2:58:15.800]  a steel-structured building to fall to the ground. Governor Ventura, as the way
[2:58:15.800 --> 2:58:19.320]  three of them did, Governor Ventura stayed with a 70-second break. We're
[2:58:19.320 --> 2:58:24.640]  coming right back to you, coming in hot. And as a underwater demolition expert, I
[2:58:24.640 --> 2:58:28.640]  want to get your take on explosives. We'll be right back.
