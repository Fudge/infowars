[00:00.000 --> 00:04.080]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're live broadcasting worldwide on this Monday
[00:04.080 --> 00:10.240]  edition, November 4th, 2019. I'm your host, Alex Jones. And all across the
[00:10.240 --> 00:14.900]  country and all across the world, free humanity is taking action in the face of
[00:14.900 --> 00:20.060]  tyranny. And yesterday, some wonderful things happened here in Austin. We got
[00:20.060 --> 00:24.660]  directly in the stealth candidate for 2020, Hillary's face, but inside even
[00:24.660 --> 00:27.660]  more amazing things happen that you'll see for the first time when we come
[00:27.660 --> 00:29.660]  back.
[00:58.660 --> 01:05.660]  The man turned in 1984. It's 1776.
[01:05.660 --> 01:12.660]  It falls now. And it falls is fighting back.
[01:12.660 --> 01:20.660]  The man turned in 1984. It's 1776.
[01:20.660 --> 01:25.660]  Hillary clocked down as an enemy of the American people.
[01:25.660 --> 01:31.660]  Hillary clocked down as an enemy of the American people.
[01:31.660 --> 01:36.660]  Hillary clocked in is openly calling for censorship of all pancreas and
[01:36.660 --> 01:40.660]  nationalists. Hillary clocked in is a criminal.
[01:40.660 --> 01:44.660]  To steal, to steal our nation out of the cycle.
[01:44.660 --> 01:47.660]  Hillary clocked in is a criminal.
[01:47.660 --> 01:52.660]  Hillary clocked in will never silence the American people.
[01:52.660 --> 01:57.660]  America is awake. America knows what's happening.
[01:57.660 --> 02:01.660]  And m4rs.com is exposing it.
[02:01.660 --> 02:05.660]  America is back. America is back.
[02:05.660 --> 02:07.660]  America is back.
[02:07.660 --> 02:10.660]  America is back.
[02:10.660 --> 02:15.660]  America is back.
[02:15.660 --> 02:25.660]  America is back.
[02:25.660 --> 02:30.660]  America is back.
[02:30.660 --> 02:35.660]  America is back.
[02:35.660 --> 02:39.660]  America is back.
[02:39.660 --> 02:45.660]  America is back.
[02:45.660 --> 02:49.660]  America is back.
[02:49.660 --> 02:54.660]  America is back.
[02:54.660 --> 03:03.660]  America is back.
[03:03.660 --> 03:09.660]  and Hillary has failed to silence America's speech.
[03:09.660 --> 03:14.660]  America is back. America is back.
[03:14.660 --> 03:18.660]  America is back. America is back.
[03:18.660 --> 03:20.660]  America is back.
[03:20.660 --> 03:23.660]  Hillary Clinton worked with the children
[03:23.660 --> 03:25.660]  but us were definitely abstaining.
[03:25.660 --> 03:28.660]  Hillary Clinton wants to sexualize our children.
[03:28.660 --> 03:31.660]  Hillary Clinton is a war criminal.
[03:31.660 --> 03:37.660]  Hillary Clinton, who can't even walk, are going down.
[03:37.660 --> 03:39.660]  Hillary Clinton is a failure.
[03:39.660 --> 03:42.660]  Your Democratic Party is collapsing.
[03:42.660 --> 03:46.660]  Every city you control is collapsing into hell.
[03:46.660 --> 03:50.660]  Everyone is running from the Democrats and their meddling.
[03:50.660 --> 03:55.660]  Your so-called power card, the Democratic Party that found it,
[03:55.660 --> 03:58.660]  the KKK is going down.
[03:58.660 --> 04:03.660]  The Democrats are KKK.
[04:03.660 --> 04:08.660]  The Democrats are KKK.
[04:08.660 --> 04:10.660]  The Democrats are KKK.
[04:10.660 --> 04:14.660]  And look, they hope to bring the power to KKK.
[04:14.660 --> 04:16.660]  Down with the KKK.
[04:16.660 --> 04:18.660]  Down with the children of this lady.
[04:18.660 --> 04:20.660]  Down with the KKK.
[04:20.660 --> 04:22.660]  And she said, no?
[04:22.660 --> 04:24.660]  Down with the KKK and Hillary.
[04:24.660 --> 04:26.660]  Down with the KKK and Hillary.
[04:26.660 --> 04:30.660]  Down with the Democrats that found it, the KKK.
[04:30.660 --> 04:33.660]  Down with the Democrats that found it, the KKK.
[04:33.660 --> 04:56.660]  Down with the Democrats that found it, the KKK.
[04:56.660 --> 05:04.660]  We have strong disagreement on policy grounds and hope there's diversity in policy here.
[05:04.660 --> 05:06.660]  I don't care what your views are.
[05:06.660 --> 05:09.660]  I hope you articulate them and defend them and listen and debate them.
[05:09.660 --> 05:10.660]  That's important.
[05:10.660 --> 05:12.660]  But we have something in common.
[05:12.660 --> 05:16.660]  We have a set of values that are at the core of this country that hold this place together.
[05:16.660 --> 05:21.660]  Clinton, deep state bag man, Comey thinks it's funny that he was the leaker
[05:21.660 --> 05:23.660]  and that he lied to Congress and the world.
[05:23.660 --> 05:25.660]  He thinks committing crimes are funny.
[05:25.660 --> 05:29.660]  But the word is, the criminal investigation is honing in on him.
[05:29.660 --> 05:34.660]  From my new home in New Zealand, I will...
[05:34.660 --> 05:38.660]  Oh, and now suddenly he's talking about moving to New Zealand.
[05:38.660 --> 05:40.660]  Not so fast, criminal.
[05:40.660 --> 05:42.660]  We're going to bring you to justice.
[05:42.660 --> 05:44.660]  And we're going to bring Hillary to justice as well.
[05:44.660 --> 05:49.660]  Because if we don't, you criminals will continue to strike back at your enemy.
[05:49.660 --> 05:51.660]  But the American people know how much you hate us.
[05:51.660 --> 05:56.660]  And we're fighting back at infowars.com, newswars.com, and band.video.
[06:21.660 --> 06:25.660]  November 4th, 2019, I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[06:25.660 --> 06:29.660]  We're going to be here for the next four hours, Lord willing.
[06:29.660 --> 06:37.660]  We have former U.S. Ambassador under the previous administration, Alan Teese,
[06:37.660 --> 06:41.660]  joining as former host of Crossfire in the third hour.
[06:41.660 --> 06:46.660]  Gavin McInnis will be joining us for part of the second hour.
[06:46.660 --> 06:53.660]  We have a listener driving in from outside Austin who was at the Hillary event last night in Northwest Austin
[06:53.660 --> 07:02.660]  who was in the front row, was able to confront her for four minutes on her crimes and Bill Clinton's crimes
[07:02.660 --> 07:04.660]  and her incredible hypocrisy.
[07:04.660 --> 07:06.660]  He will be with us at the start of the next hour.
[07:06.660 --> 07:10.660]  He's driving in right now.
[07:10.660 --> 07:16.660]  The video of that and so much more, and it's powerful, is on infowars.com and newswars.com.
[07:16.660 --> 07:23.660]  Hillary confronted face-to-face in Austin Stealth 2020 candidate gives dear in the headlights look
[07:23.660 --> 07:28.660]  when asked about Paula Jones during female hardship speech
[07:28.660 --> 07:35.660]  with her and Webster Hubble's daughter, Chelsea Hubble, Chelsea Hubble, Clinton.
[07:35.660 --> 07:40.660]  You'll wait till you see this. The guy was literally maybe 12 feet from him
[07:40.660 --> 07:43.660]  and they did not know what to do.
[07:43.660 --> 07:49.660]  And if this turns into a chain reaction, it's going to devastate her plans.
[07:49.660 --> 07:52.660]  To remove Trump by the end of the year is the Hillary deep state plan.
[07:52.660 --> 07:57.660]  She's the chief general of the deep state, literally.
[07:57.660 --> 07:59.660]  And then she'll run for president.
[07:59.660 --> 08:02.660]  She believes pretty much unopposed by whoever the Republicans have.
[08:02.660 --> 08:05.660]  You say, oh, they'll still have Mike Pence in there.
[08:05.660 --> 08:07.660]  Now, they've already got it lined up to remove Mike Pence.
[08:07.660 --> 08:09.660]  We told you that two years ago.
[08:09.660 --> 08:15.660]  The exact plan now it's all public CNN, MSNBC.
[08:15.660 --> 08:16.660]  It is everywhere.
[08:16.660 --> 08:20.660]  And there's the drudgerport.com headline right now.
[08:20.660 --> 08:24.660]  Fox News poll. Hillary beats Trump.
[08:24.660 --> 08:27.660]  And of course, that's a fake poll out of Fox.
[08:27.660 --> 08:30.660]  They put one out a few weeks ago showing that Biden would beat Trump.
[08:30.660 --> 08:34.660]  Folks that put out the scientific polls said that they read the poll wrong.
[08:34.660 --> 08:36.660]  But Fox News put out this info, but it doesn't matter.
[08:36.660 --> 08:39.660]  You know how rigged these polls are.
[08:39.660 --> 08:43.660]  But the deep state believes to remove him by hook or by crook.
[08:43.660 --> 08:49.660]  And so it's good to know that Trump is in trouble so that we fight back
[08:49.660 --> 08:55.660]  and he doesn't lose if we are happy and dumb and satisfied.
[08:55.660 --> 08:57.660]  They're going to take this from us.
[08:57.660 --> 09:03.660]  Fat, dumb and satisfied.
[09:03.660 --> 09:05.660]  That's why they lost three years ago.
[09:05.660 --> 09:12.660]  We are now one month and three days out from this incredibly
[09:12.660 --> 09:15.660]  animating contest.
[09:15.660 --> 09:19.660]  And that animating contest of liberty is happening now.
[09:19.660 --> 09:20.660]  And you can feel the energy.
[09:20.660 --> 09:21.660]  You can see it.
[09:21.660 --> 09:25.660]  Democratic Party openly aligned with the chai comms and the globalists
[09:25.660 --> 09:29.660]  openly against America, openly against free market and prosperity
[09:29.660 --> 09:37.660]  and Christianity, openly teaching a venomous, anti-white, race-based system
[09:37.660 --> 09:41.660]  that is meant to turn everyone in the nation against each other
[09:41.660 --> 09:45.660]  and then make it impossible to oppose the globalists bringing in
[09:45.660 --> 09:50.660]  giant, weaponized, politicized third world hordes who are taught
[09:50.660 --> 09:54.660]  as their operating system to hate white people and are totally
[09:54.660 --> 09:59.660]  entitled to hate America and say America sucks while battling
[09:59.660 --> 10:01.660]  to get into the nation.
[10:01.660 --> 10:03.660]  In evidence of that, here's the latest.
[10:03.660 --> 10:06.660]  Ilhan Omar, Bernie Sanders, a president who will fight against
[10:06.660 --> 10:07.660]  Western imperialism.
[10:07.660 --> 10:08.660]  The West is evil.
[10:08.660 --> 10:10.660]  Christianity is evil.
[10:10.660 --> 10:11.660]  White people are evil.
[10:11.660 --> 10:13.660]  She said all that.
[10:13.660 --> 10:17.660]  But she battles to get in here with all the fake husbands she married
[10:17.660 --> 10:21.660]  to bring in and all the anchor babies and all the welfare and never
[10:21.660 --> 10:26.660]  working a day in her life just living off America's big fat, juicy
[10:26.660 --> 10:27.660]  tatas.
[10:27.660 --> 10:31.660]  While bitching about the milk, she gorges herself with her blood
[10:31.660 --> 10:34.660]  snout on.
[10:34.660 --> 10:37.660]  Meanwhile, Oklahoma City Police investigate it's okay to be white
[10:37.660 --> 10:39.660]  flyers as potential hate crime.
[10:39.660 --> 10:43.660]  Yes, white people are bad.
[10:43.660 --> 10:45.660]  And if you don't agree, it's hate.
[10:45.660 --> 10:48.660]  How dare you say white people are okay?
[10:48.660 --> 10:53.660]  Meanwhile, German City of Dresden declares Nazi emergency.
[10:53.660 --> 10:57.660]  Goes on to say that right wing nationalists are spreading and that
[10:57.660 --> 11:00.660]  that should be illegal.
[11:00.660 --> 11:04.660]  Meanwhile, experts, Swedish bombings not matched by any industrialized
[11:04.660 --> 11:07.660]  country carried out by the Islamist.
[11:07.660 --> 11:11.660]  Meanwhile, missing New Hampshire couple found buried on Texas beach
[11:11.660 --> 11:12.660]  on the Mexico border.
[11:12.660 --> 11:16.660]  Sheriff's office says all the local news tells you that it's part of an
[11:16.660 --> 11:20.660]  epidemic of cartels killing people predominantly white.
[11:20.660 --> 11:23.660]  It's racially motivated because the media has said whites are evil.
[11:23.660 --> 11:24.660]  It's open season on them.
[11:24.660 --> 11:27.660]  Killing them, burying them and then driving their truck in RV across
[11:27.660 --> 11:33.660]  the Mexico side where it was found.
[11:33.660 --> 11:37.660]  But CNN and the New York Times will not tell you that they were even
[11:37.660 --> 11:38.660]  murdered.
[11:38.660 --> 11:40.660]  They say there's an investigation into how they died.
[11:40.660 --> 11:42.660]  They may have buried themselves.
[11:42.660 --> 11:44.660]  I'm not kidding.
[11:44.660 --> 11:48.660]  They may have shot themselves in the head and then tied themselves,
[11:48.660 --> 11:52.660]  their hands on their back, gotten a shallow grave and then shot
[11:52.660 --> 11:55.660]  themselves in the back of the head.
[11:55.660 --> 11:58.660]  They followed the last GPS location of where their phone had been,
[11:58.660 --> 12:02.660]  but the entire corporate media will not tell you that the vehicles
[12:02.660 --> 12:06.660]  were taken across in the Mexico and that it's super dangerous in
[12:06.660 --> 12:07.660]  Padre Island.
[12:07.660 --> 12:09.660]  The local news will tell you that.
[12:09.660 --> 12:15.660]  We're going to be getting into that as well today.
[12:15.660 --> 12:19.660]  Also, we're going to look at Democrat crapple cities with total gun
[12:19.660 --> 12:24.660]  control, highest crime rate in the world of any cities.
[12:24.660 --> 12:30.660]  And now, California, since 1976 or so, has a wilding project they
[12:30.660 --> 12:32.660]  signed on to a UN treaty.
[12:32.660 --> 12:34.660]  It's not part of the U.S. law, but they did it.
[12:34.660 --> 12:39.660]  And cities, counties, states are signing on to not remove anything
[12:39.660 --> 12:43.660]  from the forest and have it untouched by human hands.
[12:43.660 --> 12:46.660]  And so when you don't clear out the underbrush and you don't clear
[12:46.660 --> 12:51.660]  out the dead trees, it creates decades of what they call tender.
[12:51.660 --> 12:54.660]  And so when all that kindling gets struck by lightning,
[12:54.660 --> 12:56.660]  you get raging infernos.
[12:56.660 --> 12:58.660]  Trump calls it raking out the forest.
[12:58.660 --> 13:02.660]  That's actually the technical term in Europe in German.
[13:02.660 --> 13:04.660]  It translates out of that.
[13:04.660 --> 13:07.660]  But now they don't rake the forest.
[13:07.660 --> 13:11.660]  And so they have thousands of fires a day, and the power is off to
[13:11.660 --> 13:12.660]  much of the state.
[13:12.660 --> 13:17.660]  And their answer is, have the state basically nationalize its
[13:17.660 --> 13:20.660]  own kleptocracy, have California be its own state.
[13:20.660 --> 13:21.660]  Take it over.
[13:21.660 --> 13:24.660]  Can you imagine, once like Venezuela, the state of California
[13:24.660 --> 13:25.660]  runs the power company?
[13:25.660 --> 13:29.660]  It'll be even more disastrous.
[13:29.660 --> 13:30.660]  Trump says, get your act together.
[13:30.660 --> 13:32.660]  Trump threatens to pull federal support.
[13:32.660 --> 13:34.660]  California fires rage.
[13:34.660 --> 13:36.660]  That's coming up.
[13:36.660 --> 13:40.660]  The leftist Hollywood's lecturing everyone that living a good
[13:40.660 --> 13:43.660]  life is causing and has nothing to do with it.
[13:43.660 --> 13:48.660]  As they fly around on record jet sales and record jet purchases
[13:48.660 --> 13:51.660]  as they lecture everyone as well.
[13:51.660 --> 13:53.660]  That's all coming up today.
[13:53.660 --> 14:00.660]  And also, Apple has come out with its new system.
[14:00.660 --> 14:03.660]  It's not a bank, but it's a credit card, and it tracks
[14:03.660 --> 14:04.660]  everything you do.
[14:04.660 --> 14:07.660]  And if you're not a good little globalist, it will, of course,
[14:07.660 --> 14:10.660]  turn your ability to buy and sell off.
[14:10.660 --> 14:11.660]  They call that curating.
[14:11.660 --> 14:14.660]  They say that their political views, just like in China, they
[14:14.660 --> 14:17.660]  help China oppress their people, will be directed at you and
[14:17.660 --> 14:19.660]  your family.
[14:19.660 --> 14:21.660]  Cashless, made effortless.
[14:21.660 --> 14:24.660]  Oh, what a wonderful system where it tracks you.
[14:24.660 --> 14:29.660]  And by the way, I'm driving down the road and my car goes,
[14:29.660 --> 14:31.660]  being the sensor, you need gas.
[14:31.660 --> 14:33.660]  You're at less than a quarter tank.
[14:33.660 --> 14:38.660]  And then my iPhone, my little surveillance devil made by
[14:38.660 --> 14:39.660]  slaves in China.
[14:39.660 --> 14:40.660]  Oh, I mean, I've been, I'm a hypocrite.
[14:40.660 --> 14:44.660]  I'm just pointing out how evil it is.
[14:44.660 --> 14:46.660]  Can somebody come out with a smartphone that isn't spying on
[14:46.660 --> 14:48.660]  you and isn't corrupt and isn't evil?
[14:48.660 --> 14:52.660]  And the iPhone, without me signing on for it, without me
[14:52.660 --> 14:55.660]  agreeing to it, told me, oh, you're out of gas.
[14:55.660 --> 14:56.660]  Here's some places.
[14:56.660 --> 14:58.660]  And then, of course, it recommends to you, like Google
[14:58.660 --> 15:04.660]  does, who pays to be recommended?
[15:04.660 --> 15:06.660]  See, for a long time, Google and Apple would tell you we're
[15:06.660 --> 15:07.660]  good restaurants.
[15:07.660 --> 15:08.660]  We're in things.
[15:08.660 --> 15:09.660]  Now they don't.
[15:09.660 --> 15:11.660]  They tell you the veterinarian that pays them.
[15:11.660 --> 15:13.660]  They tell you the restaurant that pays them.
[15:13.660 --> 15:15.660]  And they're admitting, like in China, if you're not a good
[15:15.660 --> 15:17.660]  globalist, they won't recommend your restaurant period.
[15:17.660 --> 15:19.660]  It will be invisible.
[15:19.660 --> 15:22.660]  So the tentacles of the AI takeover are happening
[15:22.660 --> 15:23.660]  everywhere.
[15:23.660 --> 15:26.660]  And now the phones aren't asking just like smart meters
[15:26.660 --> 15:27.660]  aren't asking.
[15:27.660 --> 15:30.660]  They're interfacing with all the devices in your home and
[15:30.660 --> 15:31.660]  tracking everything you're doing.
[15:31.660 --> 15:34.660]  And so I spent 30 minutes this morning going in and
[15:34.660 --> 15:35.660]  turning it off.
[15:35.660 --> 15:41.660]  I never activated Apple Play.
[15:41.660 --> 15:45.660]  Oh, but it turns out part of your Spotify agreement now
[15:45.660 --> 15:49.660]  with Apple controls that so it opts you in.
[15:49.660 --> 15:52.660]  You have to actively resist the criminal AI takeover.
[15:52.660 --> 16:21.660]  And even when you do, it's still turned on.

[17:02.240 --> 17:04.740]  but we're waiting for prices too crazy to pass up,
[17:04.740 --> 17:07.400]  this will be the most important message you'll ever hear.
[17:07.400 --> 17:09.640]  Bill Hyde here, I want to tell you about a huge sale
[17:09.640 --> 17:12.980]  with historically low prices on our PPX microgrid system
[17:12.980 --> 17:15.920]  that's going to let you produce an endless supply of electricity
[17:15.920 --> 17:16.720]  off the grid.
[17:16.720 --> 17:19.380]  The clearance price is a result of the historic flooding
[17:19.380 --> 17:21.900]  we're having here, right on the east bank of the Mississippi.
[17:21.900 --> 17:24.660]  Because of the flooding, we've had to move a lot of our inventory
[17:24.660 --> 17:26.100]  to a temporary location.
[17:26.100 --> 17:28.100]  And rather than move it back to the warehouse,
[17:28.100 --> 17:29.900]  we thought we'd offer the system at a price
[17:29.900 --> 17:32.380]  that might seem unbelievable if you didn't
[17:32.380 --> 17:33.860]  know the floodwater's backstory.
[17:33.860 --> 17:35.300]  So here's what you should do right now.

[18:40.620 --> 18:42.260]  And this sale is part of that sale.

[19:00.420 --> 19:02.580]  But it's going to have to end by early next week
[19:02.580 --> 19:04.620]  because we're selling out of many of our best selling
[19:04.620 --> 19:06.260]  products like ultra 12.

[20:24.540 --> 20:27.540]  on the lines of the Infowar.
[20:35.540 --> 20:40.540]  I don't want to get into the technocracy takeover
[20:40.540 --> 20:43.540]  and just mention it as a footnote.
[20:46.540 --> 20:48.540]  But we have stepped into the twilight zone.
[20:48.540 --> 20:50.540]  We are now in the technocracy.
[20:50.540 --> 20:53.540]  We are now in the AI takeover.
[20:53.540 --> 20:55.540]  In fact, we're not in the beginning stages of it.
[20:55.540 --> 20:58.540]  We are in the middle stages.
[20:58.540 --> 21:00.540]  And the longest segment of the hour,
[21:00.540 --> 21:05.540]  11 minutes long, roughly, is the last segment,
[21:05.540 --> 21:06.540]  the fifth segment.
[21:06.540 --> 21:09.540]  So I'm going to cover it then
[21:09.540 --> 21:14.540]  and just give you some real world examples
[21:14.540 --> 21:16.540]  of how all of this works
[21:16.540 --> 21:19.540]  and how they've already gotten you in agreements
[21:19.540 --> 21:22.540]  you clicked on with droids and iPhones,
[21:22.540 --> 21:25.540]  other smart devices years ago
[21:25.540 --> 21:27.540]  that they can now interface
[21:27.540 --> 21:30.540]  with all these other devices around you.
[21:30.540 --> 21:33.540]  And it's being designed to take full control
[21:33.540 --> 21:35.540]  of the human species.
[21:35.540 --> 21:39.540]  That's in the segment that's coming up
[21:39.540 --> 21:41.540]  in about 30 minutes.
[21:41.540 --> 21:52.540]  Right now, let me just tell you some of what's coming up.
[21:52.540 --> 21:54.540]  More and more, and I've always done this,
[21:54.540 --> 21:56.540]  but I really want to just break down
[21:56.540 --> 21:58.540]  the different strategies of the globalist,
[21:58.540 --> 22:01.540]  what their in-game goal is, who they really are,
[22:01.540 --> 22:04.540]  and then how these different systems overlay
[22:04.540 --> 22:08.540]  to destabilize the human community
[22:08.540 --> 22:11.540]  and make us very easy to control and manipulate.
[22:11.540 --> 22:13.540]  What the globalists are doing
[22:13.540 --> 22:16.540]  can easily be defeated if we're aware of it
[22:16.540 --> 22:20.540]  and conscious of it and do something about it.
[22:20.540 --> 22:23.540]  I was flying around this weekend with a friend
[22:23.540 --> 22:26.540]  who is a helicopter pilot,
[22:26.540 --> 22:30.540]  and I was also talking to some military pilots,
[22:30.540 --> 22:32.540]  and they were joking around going,
[22:32.540 --> 22:36.540]  yeah, look, Alex, it's funny how that condensation trail
[22:36.540 --> 22:41.540]  is only at about 3,000 feet
[22:41.540 --> 22:44.540]  or in a helicopter.
[22:44.540 --> 22:46.540]  I actually have video of it.
[22:46.540 --> 22:49.540]  I haven't gotten around to releasing the conversation.
[22:49.540 --> 22:57.540]  And it just starts and stops right there.
[22:57.540 --> 23:00.540]  And then you see it turn right back on at another point.
[23:00.540 --> 23:04.540]  That's not classical ice crystals.
[23:04.540 --> 23:07.540]  And they go, obviously, you know that.
[23:07.540 --> 23:09.540]  And I went, yes.
[23:09.540 --> 23:13.540]  In 1992, a group of scientists won the Nobel Prize for Science
[23:13.540 --> 23:15.540]  for creating a plan to add
[23:15.540 --> 23:17.540]  barium salts, aluminum dioxide,
[23:17.540 --> 23:21.540]  and also radioactive isotopes,
[23:21.540 --> 23:23.540]  like strontium,
[23:23.540 --> 23:26.540]  to jet fuel, kerosene,
[23:26.540 --> 23:29.540]  that is then aerosolized by the jet engines
[23:29.540 --> 23:31.540]  to create nuclei.
[23:31.540 --> 23:34.540]  They use ice crystal formations,
[23:34.540 --> 23:42.540]  but it's much thicker and at altitudes much lower.
[23:42.540 --> 23:45.540]  And then by the time it becomes standard,
[23:45.540 --> 23:47.540]  no longer a beta test,
[23:47.540 --> 23:50.540]  they had the former head of the CIA come out two years ago
[23:50.540 --> 23:53.540]  on C-SPAN at the Council on Foreign Relations and say,
[23:53.540 --> 23:56.540]  we've been doing giant secret geoengineering tests
[23:56.540 --> 24:01.540]  to save the Earth from global warming and solar radiation.
[24:01.540 --> 24:04.540]  And we've had problems with global treaties and things,
[24:04.540 --> 24:07.540]  but now we're creating an international framework
[24:07.540 --> 24:10.540]  to control the Earth's atmosphere officially.
[24:10.540 --> 24:15.540]  And then they laid out the report that you read the report.
[24:15.540 --> 24:17.540]  It's how they added to the jet fuel,
[24:17.540 --> 24:20.540]  stood at the industrial level precisely,
[24:20.540 --> 24:22.540]  as I told you 20 years ago, it was being done,
[24:22.540 --> 24:25.540]  because we had the patents, we had the science prize.
[24:25.540 --> 24:27.540]  We knew about the program.
[24:27.540 --> 24:30.540]  But here's the rest of the problem.
[24:30.540 --> 24:33.540]  It's not being done to protect the atmosphere.
[24:33.540 --> 24:35.540]  The scientists that have looked at it point out
[24:35.540 --> 24:37.540]  it's destroying the atmosphere.
[24:37.540 --> 24:40.540]  And it's poisoning the ground topsoil
[24:40.540 --> 24:43.540]  that on average is only about two inches thick
[24:43.540 --> 24:46.540]  with the aluminum dioxide, the barium salts,
[24:46.540 --> 24:48.540]  and the other radioactive isotopes.
[24:48.540 --> 24:53.540]  And it's causing collapses in insect populations.
[24:53.540 --> 24:57.540]  And it's causing major buildup of aluminum in the brain
[24:57.540 --> 25:02.540]  way higher than what you get from drinking out of aluminum cans.
[25:02.540 --> 25:04.540]  So we're being killed.
[25:04.540 --> 25:07.540]  And then you add the fluoride, which they admit is doing it.
[25:07.540 --> 25:11.540]  And then you add all the vaccines with the added pathogens
[25:11.540 --> 25:15.540]  and taint and chemicals and metals.
[25:15.540 --> 25:19.540]  And then you read the science books written by John P. Holdren,
[25:19.540 --> 25:24.540]  Obama's science are the year I was born 45 years ago
[25:24.540 --> 25:28.540]  in 1974, eco science, and they admit the plan.
[25:28.540 --> 25:30.540]  And Bertrand Russell admits the plan.
[25:30.540 --> 25:34.540]  Diet, injections, and injunctions.
[25:34.540 --> 25:44.540]  The law, the police, the injections we give you.
[25:44.540 --> 25:47.540]  Diet, injections, and injunctions.
[25:47.540 --> 25:50.540]  The police, what we feed you and what we inject into you.
[25:50.540 --> 25:52.540]  We'll make the practice of the proletariat,
[25:52.540 --> 25:57.540]  that's the general public, from a communist lexicon.
[25:57.540 --> 25:59.540]  It'll make the public's rebellion
[25:59.540 --> 26:01.540]  against the scientific dictatorship.
[26:01.540 --> 26:04.540]  That's what Huxley was calling it in the 20s in the plan.
[26:04.540 --> 26:11.540]  Huxley, Dalton, Wedgewood, Bertrand Russell.
[26:11.540 --> 26:14.540]  Rebellion against the scientific dictatorship,
[26:14.540 --> 26:17.540]  the technocracy, their words not mine,
[26:17.540 --> 26:20.540]  will be as impossible as the practice of sheep
[26:20.540 --> 26:26.540]  rebelling against the practice of eating mutton.
[26:26.540 --> 26:28.540]  And they called it mutton because they knew
[26:28.540 --> 26:31.540]  that the general public wouldn't even put sheep and mutton together.
[26:31.540 --> 26:36.540]  Mutton is sheep.
[26:36.540 --> 26:38.540]  Is sheep rebel against being eaten?
[26:38.540 --> 26:44.540]  No, they're sheep.
[26:44.540 --> 26:51.540]  Rebellion by the proletariat against the scientific dictatorship,
[26:51.540 --> 26:57.540]  the technocracy, will be as impossible as a rebellion of sheep
[26:57.540 --> 27:01.540]  against the practice of eating mutton.
[27:01.540 --> 27:04.540]  You know, I don't think that's very funny or cool,
[27:04.540 --> 27:06.540]  and I don't like what you're doing to my children,
[27:06.540 --> 27:08.540]  and I don't like what you're doing to the earth,
[27:08.540 --> 27:10.540]  and I don't like how you set up a plan
[27:10.540 --> 27:13.540]  and a whole bunch of states adopted in the 70s as well
[27:13.540 --> 27:16.540]  to not cut any of the deadwood out to have giant fires everywhere.
[27:16.540 --> 27:18.540]  And I don't think it's cool how you put fluoride in the water.
[27:18.540 --> 27:21.540]  I don't think it's cool how you set up television
[27:21.540 --> 27:25.540]  to shorten attention spans and make people very, very distractible.
[27:25.540 --> 27:28.540]  You guys are really evil because you want full control
[27:28.540 --> 27:31.540]  with whatever it is your final plan is.
[27:31.540 --> 27:34.540]  You do this to us and then say,
[27:34.540 --> 27:36.540]  oh, look how dumb the public is.
[27:36.540 --> 27:40.540]  They deserve for this to happen to them.
[27:40.540 --> 27:43.540]  When you got us to trust you at the end of World War II,
[27:43.540 --> 27:45.540]  think you're the good guys,
[27:45.540 --> 27:47.540]  and then we tattle up like children,
[27:47.540 --> 27:52.540]  and you slowly dumb us down, poison us, break up our families,
[27:52.540 --> 27:54.540]  and turn us into this.
[27:54.540 --> 27:57.540]  Then I look at the royal families and the elites and the Rothschilds
[27:57.540 --> 27:59.540]  and all the inbreeding and their mental illness
[27:59.540 --> 28:02.540]  and how sick they are, both physically and spiritually,
[28:02.540 --> 28:05.540]  and you get it, they hate themselves,
[28:05.540 --> 28:08.540]  and they're falling even lower than us,
[28:08.540 --> 28:11.540]  and they want us to fall down to their level.
[28:11.540 --> 28:19.540]  They're dragging us down to their level.
[28:19.540 --> 28:21.540]  They cannot, these globalists,
[28:21.540 --> 28:24.540]  even stand the fact that we even exist,
[28:24.540 --> 28:29.540]  and they can't hide their satanic rage and satanic narcissism,
[28:29.540 --> 28:31.540]  and they're coming for you.
[28:31.540 --> 28:36.540]  It's a ruling class pleasure to hit you and hit your family.
[28:36.540 --> 28:38.540]  Well, you know what?
[28:38.540 --> 28:40.540]  There is a God in this universe, and for every action,
[28:40.540 --> 28:42.540]  there's an opposite and equal reaction,
[28:42.540 --> 28:45.540]  and in World Wars is that human resistance to tyranny.
[28:45.540 --> 28:47.540]  We want a pro-human future, and we want justice,
[28:47.540 --> 28:51.540]  and we are awakening, and humanity is rising.
[28:51.540 --> 28:56.540]  When I come back, I'm going to show you the key to victory.
[28:56.540 --> 28:58.540]  Heart disease is on the rise,
[28:58.540 --> 29:01.540]  clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels
[29:01.540 --> 29:03.540]  may not be fully detected by you,
[29:03.540 --> 29:05.540]  but the symptoms are there.
[29:05.540 --> 29:07.540]  Loss of energy, blood sugar, spikes, and drops,
[29:07.540 --> 29:10.540]  poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat
[29:10.540 --> 29:13.540]  are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[29:13.540 --> 29:16.540]  Here, how heart and body extract is making a difference
[29:16.540 --> 29:19.540]  in thousands of people's lives across America.
[29:19.540 --> 29:21.540]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[29:21.540 --> 29:23.540]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[29:23.540 --> 29:25.540]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look,
[29:25.540 --> 29:27.540]  and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[29:27.540 --> 29:29.540]  I recommend heart and body extract to everyone.
[29:29.540 --> 29:32.540]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent
[29:32.540 --> 29:35.540]  should be using this product as a preventative
[29:35.540 --> 29:57.540]  to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.
[29:57.540 --> 29:58.540]  Here's the bad news.
[29:58.540 --> 30:01.540]  Ultra 12 is selling out at 50% off.
[30:01.540 --> 30:03.540]  Double patriot points free shipping.

[30:11.540 --> 30:13.540]  till they sell out.

[30:38.540 --> 30:39.540]  So please take action.

[30:49.540 --> 30:52.540]  And it funds the Info War, a total 360 win.
[30:52.540 --> 30:57.540]  Infowarstore.com.
[30:57.540 --> 30:59.540]  The Alex Jones Show.
[30:59.540 --> 31:00.540]  A few days ago,
[31:00.540 --> 31:02.540]  my 11-year-old daughter came to me
[31:02.540 --> 31:04.540]  and she had her digital textbook.
[31:04.540 --> 31:05.540]  She said,
[31:05.540 --> 31:07.540]  Dad, they're teaching us about the periodic table,
[31:07.540 --> 31:09.540]  and I clicked on iodine,
[31:09.540 --> 31:11.540]  and it says that 2 billion people have low IQs
[31:11.540 --> 31:14.540]  or mentally retarded on the planet Earth
[31:14.540 --> 31:15.540]  because they didn't get enough iodine.
[31:15.540 --> 31:17.540]  That's what you say all the time,
[31:17.540 --> 31:19.540]  but I've heard people say you're crazy,
[31:19.540 --> 31:20.540]  and it's not true,
[31:20.540 --> 31:22.540]  but Dad, it's right here on the periodic table
[31:22.540 --> 31:24.540]  when I click it saying exactly what you said.
[31:24.540 --> 31:26.540]  And I said, I know, honey,
[31:26.540 --> 31:28.540]  that's why I have you take the high quality
[31:28.540 --> 31:30.540]  nutraceutical grade.
[31:30.540 --> 31:33.540]  Iodine is because it's why you're so vibrant.
[31:33.540 --> 31:34.540]  It's why you're so alive.
[31:34.540 --> 31:38.540]  It's one of the reasons that you're so much healthier
[31:38.540 --> 31:40.540]  and smarter than most other kids your age,
[31:40.540 --> 31:42.540]  and it just really blew her away
[31:42.540 --> 31:44.540]  to read it there for herself.
[31:44.540 --> 31:46.540]  And I know that 2 billion people,
[31:46.540 --> 31:47.540]  ladies and gentlemen,
[31:47.540 --> 31:49.540]  2 billion are mentally retarded
[31:49.540 --> 31:51.540]  on the face of the Earth right now
[31:51.540 --> 31:52.540]  because of iodine deficiency.
[31:52.540 --> 31:54.540]  Research it and find out for yourself now.
[31:54.540 --> 31:58.540]  Infowars.com
[32:25.540 --> 32:28.540]  Use that and give the other to family or friends.
[32:28.540 --> 32:31.540]  Bottom line, iodine is essential.
[32:31.540 --> 32:32.540]  That's why I harp on it.
[32:32.540 --> 32:35.540]  The globalists want you to be deficient in it
[32:35.540 --> 32:36.540]  for a lot of reasons.
[32:36.540 --> 32:38.540]  Lower IQ, makes you sluggish.
[32:38.540 --> 32:39.540]  You don't live as long.
[32:39.540 --> 32:40.540]  It's simple.
[32:40.540 --> 32:43.540]  Get your high quality iodine at infowarsstore.com
[32:43.540 --> 32:45.540]  and help fund the Infowars.
[32:45.540 --> 32:47.540]  Infowarsstore.com
[32:47.540 --> 32:49.540]  We've got a huge sale running right now,
[32:49.540 --> 32:50.540]  but it's about to end.
[32:50.540 --> 32:51.540]  It's the Iodine Challenge.
[32:51.540 --> 32:55.540]  Both types of iodine with selenium for 60% off together.
[32:59.540 --> 33:02.540]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[33:09.540 --> 33:11.540]  Waging war on corruption.
[33:11.540 --> 33:14.540]  It's Alex Jones coming to you live
[33:14.540 --> 33:21.540]  from the front lines of the Infowar.
[33:21.540 --> 33:23.540]  There have been big new developments
[33:23.540 --> 33:26.540]  in the ongoing impeachment of President Trump.
[33:26.540 --> 33:29.540]  It's now live as of last Thursday night
[33:29.540 --> 33:31.540]  in the House of Representatives.
[33:31.540 --> 33:36.540]  It's been captured by the America-hating Democrats.
[33:36.540 --> 33:39.540]  And we'll get to that some in the next hour.
[33:39.540 --> 33:41.540]  An appeals court has ruled that Trump
[33:41.540 --> 33:43.540]  must hand over his tax returns.
[33:43.540 --> 33:45.540]  They're calling that a defeat.
[33:45.540 --> 33:47.540]  The Supreme Court has overridden
[33:47.540 --> 33:51.540]  every single appeals court ruling against Trump.
[33:51.540 --> 33:54.540]  Democrats are doing things that are completely
[33:54.540 --> 33:55.540]  and totally lawless.
[33:55.540 --> 33:57.540]  That's why in my cases,
[33:57.540 --> 34:00.540]  you see them going up to the appeals processing
[34:00.540 --> 34:01.540]  before we go to trial
[34:01.540 --> 34:03.540]  with all these Hillary-funded lawsuits
[34:03.540 --> 34:06.540]  because what these courts are doing is so illegal,
[34:06.540 --> 34:08.540]  we're able to go through the court processes
[34:08.540 --> 34:11.540]  before hearings even start,
[34:11.540 --> 34:14.540]  before these lawsuits ever even get to court,
[34:14.540 --> 34:16.540]  because the things the Democrats are doing
[34:16.540 --> 34:17.540]  are unheard of.
[34:17.540 --> 34:19.540]  The appeals courts have been taking them up.
[34:19.540 --> 34:21.540]  The Democrats shoot them down,
[34:21.540 --> 34:22.540]  then it goes up to higher courts,
[34:22.540 --> 34:24.540]  control the Republicans,
[34:24.540 --> 34:27.540]  and our appeals are won.
[34:27.540 --> 34:31.540]  So we're going to be getting to that
[34:31.540 --> 34:35.540]  coming up later in the next hour.
[34:35.540 --> 34:37.540]  Now, I want to get into some solutions here
[34:37.540 --> 34:40.540]  that if people carry these out,
[34:40.540 --> 34:44.540]  it will be over for the establishment.
[34:44.540 --> 34:47.540]  There's no way they can defeat this action
[34:47.540 --> 34:49.540]  if people simply do it.
[34:49.540 --> 34:51.540]  I'll talk about it here in just a moment.
[34:51.540 --> 34:55.540]  First off, a couple things.
[34:55.540 --> 34:57.540]  As everyone knows, it is not a gimmick
[34:57.540 --> 34:59.540]  that I tend to have big sales,
[34:59.540 --> 35:01.540]  and then for a couple days after the sale
[35:01.540 --> 35:02.540]  is supposed to end,
[35:02.540 --> 35:05.540]  I don't get the new sales up.
[35:05.540 --> 35:07.540]  And a lot of that's because I'm working
[35:07.540 --> 35:10.540]  really seven days a week in the fight against the globalists
[35:10.540 --> 35:12.540]  and loving every minute of it.
[35:12.540 --> 35:14.540]  We went out and bullhorned myself,
[35:14.540 --> 35:15.540]  Hillary, for three hours yesterday,
[35:15.540 --> 35:17.540]  the crew for six hours.
[35:17.540 --> 35:18.540]  And it was very, very successful.
[35:18.540 --> 35:20.540]  We'll get to that in a moment.
[35:20.540 --> 35:23.540]  That's part of the solution.
[35:23.540 --> 35:26.540]  But we've been planning to move our high-tech,
[35:26.540 --> 35:30.540]  very nice, fancy, secure shopping cart system
[35:30.540 --> 35:33.540]  to a new update for about a year.
[35:33.540 --> 35:35.540]  We've been so busy, we haven't done it.
[35:35.540 --> 35:37.540]  So we decided to do it today
[35:37.540 --> 35:39.540]  so we can have the full IT crew and others over there
[35:39.540 --> 35:41.540]  to get it done as quickly as possible.
[35:41.540 --> 35:47.540]  So our main shopping cart is down right now.
[35:47.540 --> 35:49.540]  It should be up very soon.
[35:49.540 --> 35:52.540]  But we have our old backup that integrates with the old one,
[35:52.540 --> 35:54.540]  so it's the same system.
[35:54.540 --> 35:56.540]  And a lot of folks are visiting that right now.
[35:56.540 --> 35:59.540]  It just doesn't have all of the features
[35:59.540 --> 36:01.540]  that the newer system has.
[36:01.540 --> 36:04.540]  But that's how we fund our operations.
[36:04.540 --> 36:06.540]  So if you go to infowarstore.com,
[36:06.540 --> 36:08.540]  it just takes you to the backup.
[36:08.540 --> 36:10.540]  Shopping cart and all the big sales
[36:10.540 --> 36:13.540]  that I said would have to end by today are there.
[36:13.540 --> 36:15.540]  And now, I've just been so busy,
[36:15.540 --> 36:17.540]  I haven't come up with new specials.
[36:17.540 --> 36:18.540]  A lot of the products have sold out.
[36:18.540 --> 36:20.540]  A lot are about to sell out.
[36:20.540 --> 36:23.540]  And so I would say that we're going to try
[36:23.540 --> 36:25.540]  to have the new sale by Thursday.
[36:25.540 --> 36:28.540]  But we'll probably run this sale through Wednesday
[36:28.540 --> 36:32.540]  if they're able to get the migration over today
[36:32.540 --> 36:35.540]  and set up, then it might be tomorrow.
[36:35.540 --> 36:37.540]  But if you want to get store-wide free shipping,
[36:37.540 --> 36:39.540]  double-patriot points, 40% to 70% off
[36:39.540 --> 36:42.540]  on all the products and all the items,
[36:42.540 --> 36:45.540]  it's all there on a great top-rate shopping cart.
[36:45.540 --> 36:47.540]  It's just our mirror backup that's always waiting
[36:47.540 --> 36:49.540]  in the background.
[36:49.540 --> 36:51.540]  So again, the everything must go.
[36:51.540 --> 36:53.540]  Super sale extended for a few days,
[36:53.540 --> 36:56.540]  just because we've all been fighting so hard.
[36:56.540 --> 36:58.540]  I haven't had time to come up with some new specials
[36:58.540 --> 37:00.540]  and get those lined up.
[37:00.540 --> 37:03.540]  We're selling out the Ultra 12,
[37:03.540 --> 37:05.540]  the high-quality bottom B12.
[37:05.540 --> 37:09.540]  We're selling out of a lot of our best-selling products.
[37:09.540 --> 37:12.540]  A lot of products that had been sold out for months,
[37:12.540 --> 37:15.540]  those are now back in stock.
[37:15.540 --> 37:18.540]  DNA Force Plus has the PQQ, the CoQ10,
[37:18.540 --> 37:20.540]  and a bunch of other naturally occurring
[37:20.540 --> 37:23.540]  high-quality organic ingredients that are documented
[37:23.540 --> 37:29.540]  to turbocharge and boost what this is able to do.
[37:29.540 --> 37:32.540]  So DNA Force Plus is there.
[37:32.540 --> 37:34.540]  It's one of our more expensive products
[37:34.540 --> 37:36.540]  because it costs us a lot to produce it.
[37:36.540 --> 37:39.540]  You'll see little bitty bottles of PQQ or CoQ10 for 40, 50 bucks
[37:39.540 --> 37:42.540]  that aren't anywhere near the strength or quality of ours.
[37:42.540 --> 37:45.540]  Well, ours has large dosages of PQQ, CoQ10,
[37:45.540 --> 37:48.540]  and a whole bunch of other high-quality, again,
[37:48.540 --> 37:50.540]  ingredients that supercharge it.
[37:50.540 --> 37:53.540]  And it doesn't make your telomeres grow.
[37:53.540 --> 37:55.540]  Your telomeres run out, you die.
[37:55.540 --> 37:57.540]  That's what happens in the cells.
[37:57.540 --> 37:59.540]  It just makes them shrink slower.
[37:59.540 --> 38:01.540]  So half-full, half-empty, it's really the same thing
[38:01.540 --> 38:03.540]  as making them grow because they last longer,
[38:03.540 --> 38:06.540]  but it's not technically the same thing.
[38:06.540 --> 38:08.540]  Look into PQQ, look into CoQ10,
[38:08.540 --> 38:10.540]  and then look at our great formula
[38:10.540 --> 38:12.540]  and decide to get it for yourself and your family.
[38:12.540 --> 38:14.540]  Anybody over 40 should be on this,
[38:14.540 --> 38:16.540]  but anybody can take DNA Force Plus.
[38:16.540 --> 38:20.540]  A lot of people noticed that I've lost a lot of weight.
[38:20.540 --> 38:21.540]  I've been more focused.
[38:21.540 --> 38:23.540]  I've been more on target,
[38:23.540 --> 38:27.540]  and that's because I have been religiously taking
[38:27.540 --> 38:31.540]  our flagship supplements, the DNA Force Plus,
[38:31.540 --> 38:33.540]  the X2 and 3.
[38:33.540 --> 38:37.540]  I alternate the bio-truse selenium, the fish oil,
[38:37.540 --> 38:40.540]  the krill oil, the Brain Force Plus,
[38:40.540 --> 38:42.540]  when I need to go 20 hours,
[38:42.540 --> 38:44.540]  Turbo Force, 10-hour clean energy,
[38:44.540 --> 38:48.540]  and I've been taking the vitamin mineral fusion,
[38:48.540 --> 38:50.540]  and I don't take all these every day.
[38:50.540 --> 38:52.540]  We got a lot of great products where
[38:52.540 --> 38:54.540]  a lot of us are deficient in this or that.
[38:54.540 --> 38:55.540]  We don't need it every day.
[38:55.540 --> 38:57.540]  I just alternate throughout the week
[38:57.540 --> 38:59.540]  with about 20 of the supplements,
[38:59.540 --> 39:01.540]  and I take the fish oil before I go to bed,
[39:01.540 --> 39:02.540]  much better dreams.
[39:02.540 --> 39:04.540]  I take it in the morning.
[39:04.540 --> 39:07.540]  I'm just addicted to it, quite frankly.
[39:07.540 --> 39:09.540]  But it's all amazing, and it funds our operations,
[39:09.540 --> 39:11.540]  so it's a true win-win,
[39:11.540 --> 39:15.540]  and those sales are still going at m4store.com.
[39:15.540 --> 39:17.540]  Also, we have the Alexa Pure Breeze
[39:17.540 --> 39:19.540]  4-stage ion cluster filter.
[39:19.540 --> 39:22.540]  Leading competitors, they have the same system,
[39:22.540 --> 39:24.540]  or $400, $500, $600.
[39:24.540 --> 39:26.540]  These are normally $300.
[39:26.540 --> 39:28.540]  They discount them at $250.
[39:28.540 --> 39:30.540]  Some sales at $200.
[39:30.540 --> 39:33.540]  Well, they're at cost right now
[39:33.540 --> 39:36.540]  at $147 with reshipping.
[39:36.540 --> 39:37.540]  So that's unprecedented.
[39:37.540 --> 39:39.540]  We have a special deal with the great folks
[39:39.540 --> 39:41.540]  that bring you the Alexa Pure Water Filtration
[39:41.540 --> 39:43.540]  and Elf Filtration that are both excellent.
[39:43.540 --> 39:44.540]  You cannot beat this deal,
[39:44.540 --> 39:46.540]  and they will be gone here very, very soon
[39:46.540 --> 39:52.540]  at m4store.com or call toll 3-888-253-3139.
[39:52.540 --> 39:54.540]  You probably notice on this older
[39:54.540 --> 39:55.540]  shopping cart that's our backup,
[39:55.540 --> 39:57.540]  there are less reviews,
[39:57.540 --> 39:59.540]  because that's a separate review system
[39:59.540 --> 40:01.540]  from Power Reviews back from a few years ago,
[40:01.540 --> 40:03.540]  but still all those five-star reviews.
[40:03.540 --> 40:05.540]  There's five, 10, 15 times the reviews,
[40:05.540 --> 40:08.540]  depending on the product at our main system.
[40:08.540 --> 40:10.540]  But it's still m4store.com.
[40:10.540 --> 40:12.540]  It's just the main store is down right now
[40:12.540 --> 40:16.540]  because it's being updated, and that is a big process.
[40:16.540 --> 40:18.540]  Should be done, they say, by 1 p.m.
[40:18.540 --> 40:20.540]  Central Standard Time today.
[40:20.540 --> 40:23.540]  Okay.
[40:23.540 --> 40:27.540]  I said I was going to get into the technocracy.
[40:27.540 --> 40:29.540]  It's here.
[40:29.540 --> 40:30.540]  And I'll do that next segment.
[40:30.540 --> 40:32.540]  I kind of ran out of time plugging
[40:32.540 --> 40:34.540]  and telling you what was coming up in this segment.
[40:34.540 --> 40:38.540]  We have this gentleman joining us next hour.
[40:38.540 --> 40:41.540]  While I was outside with our rented armored vehicle
[40:41.540 --> 40:42.540]  from Dallas.
[40:42.540 --> 40:43.540]  Well, I sure like that thing.
[40:43.540 --> 40:45.540]  People love it.
[40:45.540 --> 40:47.540]  So I can be up above the hateful leftist crowds
[40:47.540 --> 40:48.540]  and bullhorn them.
[40:48.540 --> 40:49.540]  They can't stand it.
[40:49.540 --> 40:50.540]  It's very triggering for them.
[40:50.540 --> 40:54.540]  Inside, I'm told that nine different people
[40:54.540 --> 40:56.540]  began shouting at Hillary
[40:56.540 --> 40:59.540]  and bringing up her crimes to her face.
[40:59.540 --> 41:01.540]  But it was a big auditorium holding thousands,
[41:01.540 --> 41:03.540]  and it was an overflow crowd for Hillary.
[41:03.540 --> 41:05.540]  The event started about an hour and a half late.
[41:05.540 --> 41:08.540]  But this particular gentleman that joins us in studio
[41:08.540 --> 41:10.540]  next hour ahead of Gavin McGinnis
[41:10.540 --> 41:14.540]  and former U.S. ambassador to the U.N. Allen Keys.
[41:14.540 --> 41:18.540]  This gentleman is going to be joining us in studio.
[41:18.540 --> 41:20.540]  And so I want to go out to break
[41:20.540 --> 41:22.540]  just a little bit of his confrontation with Hillary
[41:22.540 --> 41:24.540]  to her face, Brandon Gray,
[41:24.540 --> 41:26.540]  veteran, a father who's just had to take action.
[41:26.540 --> 41:28.540]  And then we'll come back and play more of this
[41:28.540 --> 41:30.540]  than get into the technocracy straight ahead.
[41:30.540 --> 41:32.540]  But you should share this video.
[41:32.540 --> 41:34.540]  We have our own servers, our own platforms,
[41:34.540 --> 41:36.540]  so that they can't censor us as easily.
[41:36.540 --> 41:38.540]  Hillary confronted face-to-face in Austin
[41:38.540 --> 41:40.540]  to see all of these amazing videos,
[41:40.540 --> 41:42.540]  us outside the video, inside,
[41:42.540 --> 41:45.540]  at infowars.com and band.video.
[41:45.540 --> 41:47.540]  And please get this article out.
[41:47.540 --> 41:49.540]  We're going to go to break and just come back
[41:49.540 --> 41:51.540]  with the whole four-minute video.
[41:51.540 --> 41:53.540]  Then I'll get into the technocracy for the rest of that segment,
[41:53.540 --> 41:55.540]  the first five-minute segment.
[41:55.540 --> 41:57.540]  And then he's driving in from outside Austin.
[41:57.540 --> 41:59.540]  He should be here by then.
[41:59.540 --> 42:01.540]  We'll get Brandon Gray in here,
[42:01.540 --> 42:03.540]  because I really want to celebrate folks that are taking action.
[42:03.540 --> 42:05.540]  Look at dredgerport.com.
[42:05.540 --> 42:07.540]  Hillary Clinton
[42:07.540 --> 42:09.540]  wins in a Fox News poll against Trump.
[42:09.540 --> 42:13.540]  Yeah, she won in all the other polls in 2016,
[42:13.540 --> 42:15.540]  but they were fraudulent polls.
[42:15.540 --> 42:17.540]  But regardless,
[42:17.540 --> 42:19.540]  she's campaigning every day, everywhere.
[42:19.540 --> 42:21.540]  She's on TV more than all the other candidates combined.
[42:21.540 --> 42:23.540]  She's running. She's running.
[42:23.540 --> 42:26.540]  Hillary beats him in Fox poll.
[42:26.540 --> 42:29.540]  Divided states of 2020. Trump strong in battlegrounds.
[42:29.540 --> 42:33.540]  It's on like Donkey Kong.
[42:33.540 --> 42:35.540]  By the way, I agree with dredge,
[42:35.540 --> 42:38.540]  the polls are putting out so people know they're going for the president.
[42:38.540 --> 42:41.540]  We need to be awakened and know how serious it is.
[42:41.540 --> 42:43.540]  A lot of folks thought they'll never initiate official impeachment.
[42:43.540 --> 42:45.540]  I told you they would. They did.
[42:45.540 --> 42:48.540]  They're going for his juggler. They're going for ours.
[42:48.540 --> 42:51.540]  And only admitting this thing isn't going to be given to us
[42:51.540 --> 42:54.540]  will make sure we secure victory.
[42:54.540 --> 42:56.540]  Stay with us.
[42:56.540 --> 42:58.540]  We have strong disagreement on policy grounds,
[42:58.540 --> 43:00.540]  and I hope there's diversity in policy here.
[43:00.540 --> 43:02.540]  I don't care what your views are.
[43:02.540 --> 43:05.540]  I hope you articulate them and defend them and listen and debate them.
[43:05.540 --> 43:07.540]  That's important, but we have something in common.
[43:07.540 --> 43:10.540]  We have a set of values that are at the core of this country
[43:10.540 --> 43:12.540]  that hold this place together.
[43:12.540 --> 43:14.540]  Clinton deep state bag man, Comey,
[43:14.540 --> 43:16.540]  thinks it's funny that he was the leaker
[43:16.540 --> 43:18.540]  and that he lied to Congress in the world.
[43:18.540 --> 43:21.540]  He thinks committing crimes are funny,
[43:21.540 --> 43:24.540]  and he thinks if he acts confident, he won't get indicted.
[43:24.540 --> 43:28.540]  But word is, the criminal investigation is honing in on him.
[43:28.540 --> 43:31.540]  From my new home in New Zealand, I will...
[43:31.540 --> 43:33.540]  LAUGHTER
[43:33.540 --> 43:37.540]  Oh, and now suddenly he's talking about moving to New Zealand.
[43:37.540 --> 43:39.540]  Not so fast, criminal.
[43:39.540 --> 43:41.540]  We're going to bring you to justice,
[43:41.540 --> 43:43.540]  and we're going to bring Hillary to justice as well.
[43:43.540 --> 43:46.540]  Because if we don't, you criminals will continue
[43:46.540 --> 43:48.540]  to strike back at your enemy.
[43:48.540 --> 43:50.540]  But the American people know how much you hate us,
[43:50.540 --> 43:54.540]  and we're fighting back at infowars.com, newswars.com,
[43:54.540 --> 44:01.540]  and banned our video.
[44:24.540 --> 44:26.540]  Everybody notices.
[44:26.540 --> 44:29.540]  Two months ago, I said on air, I am going to commit
[44:29.540 --> 44:33.540]  to take X2 body's ultimate turmeric.
[44:33.540 --> 44:35.540]  I'm going to commit to flush my gut out
[44:35.540 --> 44:38.540]  with the gut fusion from infowars life.
[44:38.540 --> 44:40.540]  And when I take these products,
[44:40.540 --> 44:43.540]  the results are nothing less than miraculous.
[44:43.540 --> 44:45.540]  Well, one product that's amazing that I use
[44:45.540 --> 44:49.540]  and I don't talk enough about is gut fusion, folks.

[45:07.540 --> 45:09.540]  that are in beat concentrates,
[45:09.540 --> 45:11.540]  this is a very strong concentration.

[45:47.540 --> 45:49.540]  That's about to end.
[45:49.540 --> 45:51.540]  It is a huge sale, infowarstore.com
[45:51.540 --> 45:53.540]  and your purchase is funding infowar.
[45:53.540 --> 45:55.540]  infowars.com
[45:55.540 --> 45:57.540]  forward slash show.
[45:57.540 --> 45:59.540]  The time has come
[45:59.540 --> 46:01.540]  to defy the thought police.
[46:01.540 --> 46:03.540]  They are banning hundreds
[46:03.540 --> 46:05.540]  and hundreds of symbols every year.
[46:05.540 --> 46:07.540]  They're waging war on communication
[46:07.540 --> 46:09.540]  itself.
[46:09.540 --> 46:11.540]  As a Thavian socialist promised,
[46:11.540 --> 46:13.540]  they would do more than 70 years ago
[46:13.540 --> 46:15.540]  from their command base in England.
[46:15.540 --> 46:17.540]  We've had Oxford come out
[46:17.540 --> 46:19.540]  and ban clapping.
[46:19.540 --> 46:21.540]  The ADL and others will literally
[46:21.540 --> 46:23.540]  bankrupt you, kick you out of college,
[46:23.540 --> 46:25.540]  destroy you, have you arrested in some areas.
[46:25.540 --> 46:27.540]  If you do the OK symbol
[46:27.540 --> 46:29.540]  that's the international sign language symbol
[46:29.540 --> 46:31.540]  for OK, they know
[46:31.540 --> 46:33.540]  what they're doing. These people
[46:33.540 --> 46:35.540]  are authoritarians and they're dangerous.
[46:35.540 --> 46:37.540]  And the answer to their attack on speech
[46:37.540 --> 46:39.540]  is to exercise it in their face.
[46:39.540 --> 46:41.540]  We have a it's OK to be OK
[46:41.540 --> 46:43.540]  politically incorrect ball cap.
[46:43.540 --> 46:45.540]  It's black and white, very nice
[46:45.540 --> 46:47.540]  as the OK symbol on it. It's a great way
[46:47.540 --> 46:49.540]  to start conversations.

[46:59.540 --> 47:01.540]  You're listening to the Alex Jones
[47:01.540 --> 47:03.540]  show.
[47:03.540 --> 47:05.540]  From the front lines.
[47:07.540 --> 47:09.540]  From the front lines
[47:09.540 --> 47:11.540]  of the information war.
[47:11.540 --> 47:13.540]  It's Alex Jones.
[47:13.540 --> 47:15.540]  Mother
[47:15.540 --> 47:17.540]  tell your children not to walk my way.
[47:17.540 --> 47:19.540]  All right.
[47:19.540 --> 47:21.540]  Tell your children not to hear my words.
[47:21.540 --> 47:23.540]  What I'm going to do right now
[47:23.540 --> 47:25.540]  is I'm going to
[47:25.540 --> 47:27.540]  tell my children not to walk my way.
[47:27.540 --> 47:29.540]  All right.
[47:29.540 --> 47:31.540]  Tell your children not to hear my words.
[47:31.540 --> 47:33.540]  What I'm going to do right now
[47:33.540 --> 47:35.540]  is
[47:35.540 --> 47:37.540]  get into solutions battling the globalist
[47:37.540 --> 47:39.540]  and later I'm going to get to the big breakdown
[47:39.540 --> 47:41.540]  on the technocracy and how it's now accelerating
[47:41.540 --> 47:43.540]  its tentacle takeover because
[47:43.540 --> 47:45.540]  I need to hit this now.
[47:45.540 --> 47:47.540]  I'm going to do that.
[47:47.540 --> 47:49.540]  I have a lot of folks
[47:49.540 --> 47:51.540]  in the halls coming up to me
[47:51.540 --> 47:53.540]  some of the writers and Kruegel and it's incredible.
[47:53.540 --> 47:55.540]  The end of this process
[47:55.540 --> 47:57.540]  chef who's been caught reading
[47:57.540 --> 47:59.540]  fake transcripts
[47:59.540 --> 48:01.540]  from the
[48:01.540 --> 48:03.540]  Intelligence Committee
[48:03.540 --> 48:05.540]  Dias
[48:05.540 --> 48:07.540]  as the chairman
[48:07.540 --> 48:09.540]  now has been caught doing this
[48:09.540 --> 48:11.540]  over and over again and they're saying
[48:11.540 --> 48:13.540]  the whistleblower
[48:13.540 --> 48:15.540]  won't reveal
[48:15.540 --> 48:17.540]  their identity even though there's all these other
[48:17.540 --> 48:19.540]  quote whistleblowers
[48:19.540 --> 48:21.540]  who this individual gave the cover to
[48:23.540 --> 48:25.540]  won't testify
[48:25.540 --> 48:27.540]  in public or in front of Republicans
[48:27.540 --> 48:29.540]  just write
[48:29.540 --> 48:31.540]  letters from their questions to them
[48:31.540 --> 48:33.540]  but the Democrats get to meet with them
[48:33.540 --> 48:35.540]  in secret in the Capitol.
[48:35.540 --> 48:37.540]  That's beyond the kangaroo
[48:37.540 --> 48:39.540]  court, that's beyond the star chamber
[48:39.540 --> 48:41.540]  that's beyond the court hearing in the movie
[48:41.540 --> 48:43.540]  Idiocracy
[48:43.540 --> 48:45.540]  but they're training
[48:45.540 --> 48:47.540]  you to accept it.
[48:47.540 --> 48:49.540]  Just like Hillary said three years ago
[48:49.540 --> 48:51.540]  I'm going to run for president again
[48:51.540 --> 48:53.540]  people said we're sick of you don't do it
[48:53.540 --> 48:55.540]  she said okay I promise I won't
[48:55.540 --> 48:57.540]  then she kept running with DNC
[48:57.540 --> 48:59.540]  kept collecting the money threatening everybody
[48:59.540 --> 49:01.540]  not to be strong and run they're all just
[49:01.540 --> 49:03.540]  placeholders getting themselves
[49:03.540 --> 49:05.540]  political coverage for later
[49:05.540 --> 49:07.540]  they're told you're going to get to run later
[49:07.540 --> 49:09.540]  it's still going to be
[49:09.540 --> 49:11.540]  Hillary Clinton
[49:11.540 --> 49:13.540]  and I've told you about the people that protector
[49:13.540 --> 49:15.540]  have told me that years ago
[49:15.540 --> 49:17.540]  they sit around while she's on the phone
[49:17.540 --> 49:19.540]  giving orders to the DNC
[49:21.540 --> 49:23.540]  conference calls and now those conference
[49:23.540 --> 49:25.540]  calls have been released where she's running
[49:25.540 --> 49:27.540]  and her husband said last week yeah
[49:27.540 --> 49:29.540]  she's running yeah she's running for something
[49:29.540 --> 49:31.540]  I'm not allowed to say quite yet
[49:33.540 --> 49:35.540]  she just covers up all my rapes
[49:38.540 --> 49:40.540]  everybody's freaking out right now
[49:42.540 --> 49:44.540]  but that's how you run without any criticism
[49:44.540 --> 49:46.540]  she gives speeches seven days a week
[49:46.540 --> 49:48.540]  they've won here in Austin
[49:48.540 --> 49:50.540]  to a convention of crazy cat ladies
[49:50.540 --> 49:52.540]  who literally
[49:52.540 --> 49:54.540]  believe there's Nazis under every
[49:54.540 --> 49:56.540]  table but
[49:56.540 --> 49:58.540]  Soros is Hillary's main benefactor a real Nazi
[49:58.540 --> 50:00.540]  this is
[50:00.540 --> 50:02.540]  Twilight Zone
[50:02.540 --> 50:04.540]  and so
[50:04.540 --> 50:06.540]  Schiff the guy that gives fake
[50:06.540 --> 50:08.540]  speeches with fake transcripts
[50:08.540 --> 50:10.540]  as fake evidence now is going to release
[50:10.540 --> 50:12.540]  just started releasing minutes ago
[50:12.540 --> 50:14.540]  they talked about next week
[50:14.540 --> 50:16.540]  just a few days ago but
[50:16.540 --> 50:18.540]  we're next week and
[50:18.540 --> 50:20.540]  it's
[50:20.540 --> 50:22.540]  edited transcripts they've put up
[50:22.540 --> 50:24.540]  of the supposed whistleblowers
[50:24.540 --> 50:26.540]  who admit they never saw
[50:26.540 --> 50:28.540]  or heard any of the things that the whistleblower
[50:28.540 --> 50:30.540]  heard but this magic whistleblower
[50:30.540 --> 50:32.540]  we can't ever hear from them but they admitted
[50:32.540 --> 50:34.540]  months ago they heard it all third party
[50:34.540 --> 50:36.540]  it's all made up but it sucks
[50:38.540 --> 50:40.540]  the oxygen
[50:40.540 --> 50:42.540]  out of the room
[50:42.540 --> 50:44.540]  and Schiff calls people demanding
[50:44.540 --> 50:48.540]  you process delay
[50:48.540 --> 50:50.540]  I'm in these court hearings where Democrat
[50:50.540 --> 50:52.540]  hanging judges tell me
[50:52.540 --> 50:54.540]  in Texas and Connecticut
[50:54.540 --> 50:56.540]  give me
[50:56.540 --> 50:58.540]  the documents where you made your fortune
[50:58.540 --> 51:00.540]  off Sandy Hook and I go there are no documents
[51:00.540 --> 51:02.540]  I heard Labor talked about Sandy Hook it's my right
[51:02.540 --> 51:04.540]  to doubt it if I want a lot of stuff staged
[51:04.540 --> 51:06.540]  it doesn't exist the judge goes you are sanctioned
[51:06.540 --> 51:08.540]  I know you've got the documents
[51:08.540 --> 51:10.540]  that's why the Supreme Court
[51:10.540 --> 51:12.540]  of the state had to take it up
[51:12.540 --> 51:14.540]  because this is next level folks
[51:22.540 --> 51:24.540]  it's like federal courts tell Trump
[51:24.540 --> 51:26.540]  you can't control any borders
[51:26.540 --> 51:28.540]  Supreme Court says yes it's under the
[51:28.540 --> 51:30.540]  Constitution the president exact purview
[51:30.540 --> 51:32.540]  is that but all the other courts
[51:32.540 --> 51:34.540]  disagree imagine if they had the
[51:34.540 --> 51:36.540]  Supreme Court and Ruth Bader Ginsburg
[51:36.540 --> 51:38.540]  she's on death's doorstep
[51:40.540 --> 51:42.540]  so they're scared of action
[51:42.540 --> 51:44.540]  I'm not going to play the whole video it's on
[51:44.540 --> 51:46.540]  infowars.com it's some of the best work we've
[51:46.540 --> 51:48.540]  ever done confronting Hillary
[51:48.540 --> 51:50.540]  confronting her minions at point blank range
[51:50.540 --> 51:52.540]  riding up in a huge armored vehicle with hundreds
[51:52.540 --> 51:54.540]  of other people right to the front
[51:54.540 --> 51:56.540]  bullhorn anger taking over the whole event
[51:56.540 --> 51:58.540]  people confronting her inside
[52:00.540 --> 52:02.540]  they don't know what
[52:02.540 --> 52:04.540]  to do
[52:04.540 --> 52:06.540]  they don't know how to
[52:06.540 --> 52:08.540]  respond
[52:10.540 --> 52:12.540]  now
[52:14.540 --> 52:16.540]  we're going to get to this and we're going to get to the man
[52:16.540 --> 52:18.540]  who confronted Hillary
[52:18.540 --> 52:20.540]  at point blank range front row
[52:20.540 --> 52:22.540]  she was a deer in the headlights it went on for four
[52:22.540 --> 52:24.540]  minutes feels like a hundred years for her
[52:24.540 --> 52:26.540]  it's beautiful it's on infowars.com
[52:26.540 --> 52:28.540]  Hillary confronted
[52:28.540 --> 52:30.540]  face to face in Austin Texas and remember
[52:30.540 --> 52:32.540]  this isn't supposed to
[52:32.540 --> 52:34.540]  happen again in 2020
[52:34.540 --> 52:36.540]  we're supposed to be gone
[52:36.540 --> 52:38.540]  we're supposed to be off the air we're supposed to be
[52:38.540 --> 52:40.540]  in jail Roger's trial starts
[52:40.540 --> 52:42.540]  today they're trying to put him in present
[52:44.540 --> 52:46.540]  but only because of your prayers and your
[52:46.540 --> 52:48.540]  support we're still here in defiance of
[52:48.540 --> 52:50.540]  this and there's a penny
[52:50.540 --> 52:52.540]  across the Colorado River
[52:52.540 --> 52:54.540]  beautiful expansion bridge
[52:54.540 --> 52:56.540]  we roll in got the drone
[52:56.540 --> 52:58.540]  roll in with the American flags waving
[52:58.540 --> 53:00.540]  you got to see the video
[53:00.540 --> 53:02.540]  on infowars.com
[53:02.540 --> 53:04.540]  here's the intro to it
[53:10.540 --> 53:12.540]  America and the world
[53:12.540 --> 53:14.540]  is away
[53:14.540 --> 53:16.540]  Hillary Clinton is going down
[53:18.540 --> 53:20.540]  Hillary Clinton
[53:20.540 --> 53:22.540]  is a Chinese
[53:22.540 --> 53:24.540]  communist beacon
[53:24.540 --> 53:26.540]  in the criminal instances of the world
[53:26.540 --> 53:28.540]  America
[53:28.540 --> 53:30.540]  America is away
[53:30.540 --> 53:32.540]  in fighting back
[53:32.540 --> 53:34.540]  America will never
[53:34.540 --> 53:36.540]  back down
[53:36.540 --> 53:38.540]  America in 1984
[53:38.540 --> 53:40.540]  is 1775
[53:42.540 --> 53:44.540]  in infowars now
[53:44.540 --> 53:46.540]  in infowars
[53:46.540 --> 53:48.540]  is fighting back
[53:50.540 --> 53:52.540]  in infowars
[53:52.540 --> 53:56.540]  is 1775
[53:56.540 --> 53:58.540]  Hillary Clinton is an enemy
[53:58.540 --> 54:00.540]  of the American people
[54:00.540 --> 54:02.540]  Hillary Clinton
[54:02.540 --> 54:04.540]  is an enemy of America
[54:06.540 --> 54:08.540]  this is why they try to emasculate the men
[54:08.540 --> 54:10.540]  they do not want us doing this
[54:12.540 --> 54:14.540]  there's enough men left
[54:14.540 --> 54:16.540]  Hillary Clinton is a criminal
[54:16.540 --> 54:18.540]  to steal
[54:18.540 --> 54:20.540]  to steal our nation out
[54:20.540 --> 54:22.540]  the radio listeners we pulled right up in front of
[54:22.540 --> 54:24.540]  the thousands that were lined up
[54:24.540 --> 54:26.540]  Hillary Clinton
[54:26.540 --> 54:28.540]  and bullhorned him for six hours at point blank range
[54:28.540 --> 54:30.540]  America is awake
[54:30.540 --> 54:32.540]  America knows
[54:32.540 --> 54:34.540]  people ask how I got this voice
[54:34.540 --> 54:36.540]  this is it
[54:36.540 --> 54:38.540]  America is back
[54:38.540 --> 54:40.540]  America is back
[54:40.540 --> 54:42.540]  America is back
[54:42.540 --> 54:44.540]  America is back
[54:44.540 --> 54:46.540]  America is back
[54:50.540 --> 54:52.540]  and they boo America is back
[54:54.540 --> 54:56.540]  as they save the children that Hillary's had
[54:56.540 --> 54:58.540]  kidnapped they booed that
[55:06.540 --> 55:08.540]  all these people think being pseudo intellectuals
[55:08.540 --> 55:12.540]  and having limp wrist is powerful
[55:12.540 --> 55:14.540]  America is back
[55:22.540 --> 55:24.540]  alright folks believe me
[55:24.540 --> 55:26.540]  you want to get that video out
[55:26.540 --> 55:28.540]  Alex Jones invades Hillary Clinton rally
[55:28.540 --> 55:30.540]  in armored vehicle
[55:30.540 --> 55:32.540]  it's also on Paul Watson's site
[55:32.540 --> 55:34.540]  summit.news that's a good place to
[55:34.540 --> 55:36.540]  share it from
[55:36.540 --> 55:38.540]  Democrats were asked who they would vote for
[55:38.540 --> 55:40.540]  if Hillary Clinton entered the race
[55:40.540 --> 55:42.540]  they said Hillary Clinton
[55:42.540 --> 55:44.540]  there's a big national poll
[55:44.540 --> 55:46.540]  out
[55:46.540 --> 55:48.540]  Fox News poll
[55:48.540 --> 55:50.540]  we'll cover that when we come back next hour
[55:50.540 --> 55:52.540]  Hillary Clinton
[55:52.540 --> 55:54.540]  ladies and gentlemen
[55:54.540 --> 55:56.540]  wins
[55:56.540 --> 55:58.540]  we have a guest joining us
[55:58.540 --> 56:00.540]  who again went in
[56:00.540 --> 56:02.540]  and confronted them
[56:02.540 --> 56:04.540]  to their face
[56:06.540 --> 56:08.540]  and you asked what the solution is
[56:08.540 --> 56:10.540]  you said Alex solutions this segment
[56:10.540 --> 56:12.540]  if we the people
[56:12.540 --> 56:14.540]  go out to every Democrat
[56:14.540 --> 56:16.540]  event or speech you live in every town
[56:16.540 --> 56:18.540]  whether it's Kamala Harris
[56:18.540 --> 56:20.540]  or whether it's Hillary Clinton or whether it is Joe Biden
[56:20.540 --> 56:22.540]  who got caught groping more kids on video
[56:22.540 --> 56:24.540]  grabbing them and smelling their hair
[56:24.540 --> 56:26.540]  just a total creep
[56:26.540 --> 56:28.540]  totally out of his mind
[56:28.540 --> 56:30.540]  gaffe machine
[56:30.540 --> 56:32.540]  if he just was on a boat
[56:32.540 --> 56:34.540]  sharks would float up dead because he's such a gaffe
[56:34.540 --> 56:36.540]  that's a pun folks
[56:36.540 --> 56:38.540]  it is unbelievable
[56:38.540 --> 56:40.540]  if everybody just goes to all their events
[56:40.540 --> 56:42.540]  and is willing to stand up in the front row
[56:42.540 --> 56:44.540]  and expose what criminals they are
[56:44.540 --> 56:46.540]  they will fold
[56:46.540 --> 56:48.540]  and if you do it to local news and just
[56:48.540 --> 56:50.540]  get aggressive get in the streets
[56:50.540 --> 56:52.540]  but don't sit there like leftist do
[56:52.540 --> 56:54.540]  and just protest in front of some
[56:54.540 --> 56:56.540]  monument and then the mainstream media covers that
[56:56.540 --> 56:58.540]  no we go take over their
[56:58.540 --> 57:00.540]  events we go to congress
[57:00.540 --> 57:02.540]  we run for office we pray
[57:02.540 --> 57:04.540]  we support media outlets that tell the truth
[57:04.540 --> 57:06.540]  we spread their articles their videos
[57:06.540 --> 57:08.540]  and you're doing it
[57:08.540 --> 57:10.540]  and we're here in defiance
[57:10.540 --> 57:12.540]  of them I'm going to go over the poll

[57:18.540 --> 57:20.540]  new poll

[57:24.540 --> 57:26.540]  so well out of many but he sent us the
[57:26.540 --> 57:28.540]  video to action at infowars.com
[57:28.540 --> 57:30.540]  so we can now
[57:30.540 --> 57:32.540]  show it to you

[57:42.540 --> 57:44.540]  well they're right back stay with us
[57:46.540 --> 57:48.540]  the time has come to defy
[57:48.540 --> 57:50.540]  the thought police
[57:50.540 --> 57:52.540]  they are banning hundreds
[57:52.540 --> 57:54.540]  and hundreds of symbols every year
[57:54.540 --> 57:56.540]  they're raging war on communication
[57:56.540 --> 57:58.540]  itself
[57:58.540 --> 58:00.540]  as the Thabian socialist promised
[58:00.540 --> 58:02.540]  they would do more than 70 years ago
[58:02.540 --> 58:04.540]  from their command base in England
[58:04.540 --> 58:06.540]  we've had Oxford come out
[58:06.540 --> 58:08.540]  and ban clapping
[58:08.540 --> 58:10.540]  the ADL and others will literally
[58:10.540 --> 58:12.540]  bankrupt you kick you out of college
[58:12.540 --> 58:14.540]  destroy you have you arrested in some areas
[58:14.540 --> 58:16.540]  if you do the okay symbol
[58:16.540 --> 58:18.540]  that's the international sign language symbol
[58:18.540 --> 58:20.540]  for okay they know what they're doing
[58:20.540 --> 58:22.540]  these people are
[58:22.540 --> 58:24.540]  Thabians and they're dangerous
[58:24.540 --> 58:26.540]  and the answer to their attack on speech
[58:26.540 --> 58:28.540]  is to exercise it in their face
[58:28.540 --> 58:30.540]  we have a it's okay to be okay
[58:30.540 --> 58:32.540]  politically incorrect ball cap

[58:48.540 --> 58:50.540]  folks ask me Alex
[58:50.540 --> 58:52.540]  do you have two different types of iodine
[58:52.540 --> 58:54.540]  well that's because different
[58:54.540 --> 58:56.540]  types of physiologies different types
[58:56.540 --> 58:58.540]  of metabolic systems and people
[58:58.540 --> 59:00.540]  will like different formulas
[59:00.540 --> 59:02.540]  it's just that simple
[59:02.540 --> 59:04.540]  x3 is the deep earth crystal iodine
[59:04.540 --> 59:06.540]  and two other types because
[59:06.540 --> 59:08.540]  some people need all three types
[59:08.540 --> 59:10.540]  to absorb others like
[59:10.540 --> 59:12.540]  the pure atomic iodine
[59:12.540 --> 59:14.540]  get both they're both great for you
[59:14.540 --> 59:16.540]  whichever one you like use that
[59:16.540 --> 59:18.540]  and give the other to family or friends
[59:18.540 --> 59:20.540]  bottom line iodine
[59:20.540 --> 59:22.540]  is essential that's why I harp on it
[59:22.540 --> 59:24.540]  the globalist want you to be deficient
[59:24.540 --> 59:26.540]  in it for a lot of reasons
[59:26.540 --> 59:28.540]  lower IQ makes you sluggish

[59:42.540 --> 59:44.540]  with selenium for
[59:44.540 --> 59:50.540]  60% off together
[59:50.540 --> 59:52.540]  you're listening to the
[59:52.540 --> 1:00:20.540]  Alex Jones show
[1:00:20.540 --> 1:00:22.540]  we're not supposed to be on the air
[1:00:22.540 --> 1:00:24.540]  as a rallying point to stand up against the globalist
[1:00:24.540 --> 1:00:26.540]  and their operatives trying to take the country down
[1:00:26.540 --> 1:00:28.540]  but we are
[1:00:28.540 --> 1:00:30.540]  we told you just as sure as the sun came up
[1:00:30.540 --> 1:00:32.540]  that Hillary is planning to run
[1:00:32.540 --> 1:00:34.540]  for president 2020 but she's in a way
[1:00:34.540 --> 1:00:36.540]  to the fields exhausted
[1:00:36.540 --> 1:00:38.540]  and Trump is removed from office
[1:00:38.540 --> 1:00:40.540]  or badly damaged she believes
[1:00:40.540 --> 1:00:42.540]  she's delusional
[1:00:42.540 --> 1:00:44.540]  but I'll give it to her with her new
[1:00:44.540 --> 1:00:46.540]  money laundering operation
[1:00:46.540 --> 1:00:48.540]  that's why she has all these books published constantly
[1:00:48.540 --> 1:00:50.540]  she gets paid off
[1:00:50.540 --> 1:00:52.540]  I'll give it to her and Webster Hubble's daughter
[1:00:52.540 --> 1:00:54.540]  Chelsea Hubble
[1:00:54.540 --> 1:00:56.540]  Clinton
[1:00:56.540 --> 1:00:58.540]  when they say that they're gutsy women
[1:00:58.540 --> 1:01:00.540]  yeah you got a lot of guts
[1:01:00.540 --> 1:01:02.540]  like a bank robber or child molesters got
[1:01:02.540 --> 1:01:04.540]  I mean you've done a lot
[1:01:04.540 --> 1:01:06.540]  and you know you think everybody's scared of you
[1:01:06.540 --> 1:01:08.540]  I've had a lot of threats over the years
[1:01:08.540 --> 1:01:10.540]  you know Hillary works for people that kill folks
[1:01:10.540 --> 1:01:12.540]  and you know Hillary can come after you
[1:01:12.540 --> 1:01:14.540]  yeah I already know that
[1:01:14.540 --> 1:01:16.540]  that's why I'm in her face
[1:01:16.540 --> 1:01:18.540]  and fear that piece of garbage
[1:01:18.540 --> 1:01:20.540]  and now everything's out in the open
[1:01:20.540 --> 1:01:22.540]  so I don't want to be
[1:01:22.540 --> 1:01:24.540]  struck down I don't want to die I'll never commit suicide
[1:01:24.540 --> 1:01:26.540]  but I love life so much
[1:01:26.540 --> 1:01:28.540]  and freedom so much and other people's lives so much
[1:01:28.540 --> 1:01:30.540]  that I will not live on my knees
[1:01:30.540 --> 1:01:32.540]  that's why America's been so special
[1:01:32.540 --> 1:01:34.540]  is we had people that would stand up and fight for human rights
[1:01:34.540 --> 1:01:36.540]  England and then the United States
[1:01:36.540 --> 1:01:38.540]  ended slavery worldwide
[1:01:40.540 --> 1:01:42.540]  that's why we're taught by Ilhan Omar
[1:01:42.540 --> 1:01:44.540]  whose country Somalia's main
[1:01:44.540 --> 1:01:46.540]  industry is piracy
[1:01:46.540 --> 1:01:48.540]  and sex slavery that we're bad
[1:01:48.540 --> 1:01:50.540]  no you're bad if you want to judge a country
[1:01:50.540 --> 1:01:52.540]  according to its background and stuff
[1:01:52.540 --> 1:01:54.540]  you ought to be ashamed of yourself you
[1:01:54.540 --> 1:01:56.540]  evil monster
[1:01:56.540 --> 1:01:58.540]  you
[1:01:58.540 --> 1:02:00.540]  literally don't know how
[1:02:00.540 --> 1:02:02.540]  to wipe your ass if you didn't live in America
[1:02:02.540 --> 1:02:04.540]  and we're sick of you running it
[1:02:04.540 --> 1:02:06.540]  down and telling us how much we suck all day
[1:02:06.540 --> 1:02:08.540]  if you don't like it get
[1:02:08.540 --> 1:02:10.540]  the hell out you
[1:02:10.540 --> 1:02:12.540]  little criminal
[1:02:12.540 --> 1:02:14.540]  I love all these other jihadi
[1:02:14.540 --> 1:02:16.540]  people say no Somalia's great
[1:02:16.540 --> 1:02:18.540]  liberals go over there to show how great it is
[1:02:18.540 --> 1:02:20.540]  they get killed within 24 hours of being there
[1:02:20.540 --> 1:02:22.540]  leftist travel advisories tell young
[1:02:22.540 --> 1:02:24.540]  leftist women oh go to Somalia
[1:02:24.540 --> 1:02:26.540]  you end up in a sex dungeon within
[1:02:26.540 --> 1:02:28.540]  25 minutes
[1:02:28.540 --> 1:02:30.540]  your family doesn't pay up after they sell you
[1:02:30.540 --> 1:02:32.540]  into sex slavery your ass dead after they use you up
[1:02:32.540 --> 1:02:34.540]  but it's okay because it's
[1:02:34.540 --> 1:02:36.540]  Africa
[1:02:36.540 --> 1:02:38.540]  we'll be right back ladies and gentlemen
[1:02:38.540 --> 1:02:40.540]  here's Hillary and Obama's theme song

[1:02:46.540 --> 1:02:48.540]  psychopathic demon from hell

[1:07:31.980 --> 1:07:35.380]  didn't show it they just mentioned on a few channels even though it's very
[1:07:35.380 --> 1:07:39.260]  dynamic to have her being confronted with questions at the press that's her
[1:07:39.260 --> 1:07:43.140]  lap dog should be confronting her she's the top general of the deep state
[1:07:43.140 --> 1:07:47.860]  because she's been around so long and and work for the big foundations so
[1:07:47.860 --> 1:07:51.180]  Brandon Gray we salute you brother thank you Alex thank you tell us about
[1:07:51.180 --> 1:07:55.620]  yourself why you decided to do this and then we'll get to the video well I feel
[1:07:55.620 --> 1:08:02.140]  like I'm in a soldier in God's army you know my DNA resonates with the children
[1:08:02.140 --> 1:08:08.460]  that we've lost in this battle and they called upon me to confront this this
[1:08:08.460 --> 1:08:17.140]  woman in real time absolutely it's unreal I asked God a long time ago to come
[1:08:17.140 --> 1:08:21.660]  into me and let me see through his eyes and this is what he's showing me talk
[1:08:21.660 --> 1:08:26.860]  about that because it's no joke is it it's no joke the clarity combine that
[1:08:26.860 --> 1:08:30.700]  with the iodine and going fluoride free and your vision is just wow this is just
[1:08:30.700 --> 1:08:35.420]  it's all real everything's brighter it's crazy isn't it yes sir these evil
[1:08:35.420 --> 1:08:40.140]  people had any idea what it's like trying just trying to be good and just
[1:08:40.140 --> 1:08:47.260]  barely even able to tune into God they would never join evil that's right what
[1:08:47.260 --> 1:08:51.180]  was it like I mean there was a long line was taking three hours to get in
[1:08:51.180 --> 1:08:54.900]  because they kept waiting while more people arrived people were arriving after
[1:08:54.900 --> 1:08:59.420]  it was already supposedly gonna start that's right I had my ticket I showed up
[1:08:59.420 --> 1:09:04.540]  early you know I I was guided it didn't even feel like I was the one there I
[1:09:04.540 --> 1:09:08.660]  waited in line I was like the 10th person in the line and by the way these
[1:09:08.660 --> 1:09:12.700]  people you know when we hear about well we don't want to you know capture the
[1:09:12.700 --> 1:09:15.900]  criminals and bring people to justice because it might freak out Americans
[1:09:15.900 --> 1:09:23.060]  right the people who were left in this leftist movement they can be freaked out
[1:09:23.060 --> 1:09:27.620]  for a little while you know what I mean they need to be yeah they need to be we
[1:09:27.620 --> 1:09:31.140]  need to see justice and that's why there's so much mass hysteria going on
[1:09:31.140 --> 1:09:34.420]  right now is because nobody is being brought to what was it like when you
[1:09:34.420 --> 1:09:37.820]  saw her and Webster Hubble's daughter tautle out on the stage you know I got
[1:09:37.820 --> 1:09:40.780]  to be honest and I wish I would have maybe gathered somehow some footage of
[1:09:40.780 --> 1:09:46.460]  this but there was this black spot in the back of Hillary's head it could have
[1:09:46.460 --> 1:09:53.580]  been a bad part in her hair but it looked like a hole and I was I was I was
[1:09:53.580 --> 1:09:57.740]  10 people talk about how there's like a mount on her back and that and people
[1:09:57.740 --> 1:10:00.860]  see stuff under her clothes like she's a robot or something I looked for her
[1:10:00.860 --> 1:10:03.900]  little frame metal frame that you can usually see under her clothes but I
[1:10:03.900 --> 1:10:09.220]  would yeah yeah but the back that wasn't there but the back of her head it
[1:10:09.220 --> 1:10:14.060]  was interesting it looked like a like I said it was dark and it looked like a
[1:10:14.060 --> 1:10:18.380]  hole like a hole in the back of her head I'm not doubting you people that
[1:10:18.380 --> 1:10:21.900]  talk about her say that she's the most demonic creature the military
[1:10:21.900 --> 1:10:28.860]  guys I was with you know all guarded her previously and they just say she's
[1:10:28.860 --> 1:10:33.420]  pure evil they won't get into the you know the specifics and I mean there's I
[1:10:33.420 --> 1:10:37.300]  mean when we talk about her stinking that that's a real thing too yeah I
[1:10:37.300 --> 1:10:41.700]  didn't get that close well I want to roll some of this footage it was a
[1:10:41.700 --> 1:10:46.420]  four-minute confrontation and then after we play it what were the different
[1:10:46.420 --> 1:10:49.660]  minions there because I know when you were talking I've seen some of the other
[1:10:49.660 --> 1:10:53.700]  videos from other angles they were like praying and then like shaking and then
[1:10:53.700 --> 1:10:57.060]  when you finally got taken out they were just all worshiping Hillary I want to
[1:10:57.060 --> 1:11:00.860]  see what it was like up close let's go ahead and roll some of this video from
[1:11:00.860 --> 1:11:04.620]  Austin yesterday as the official Democrat candidate Hillary she is
[1:11:04.620 --> 1:11:31.620]  official they just insult us by not admitting it was confronted like Juanita

[1:13:27.540 --> 1:13:31.260]  video is up on info wars.com we're gonna get to more when we come back as more
[1:13:31.260 --> 1:13:35.740]  happens but what's important to understand here is this type of action
[1:13:35.740 --> 1:13:38.180]  will change the world hundreds and hundreds people did this with Bill
[1:13:38.180 --> 1:13:41.260]  Clinton's a rapist to his face that totally derailed them they try to
[1:13:41.260 --> 1:13:45.580]  project that lie on the Trump the same Kavanaugh stuff coming up again watch
[1:13:45.580 --> 1:13:49.220]  the middle of the impeachment they're gonna pull more of that and there won't
[1:13:49.220 --> 1:13:55.220]  be any proof it'll all be more of the same total fraud at a gut level what do
[1:13:55.220 --> 1:13:59.780]  you expect about to happen mr. Gray well what I hope happens is we start to see
[1:13:59.780 --> 1:14:05.700]  some heads roll politically we need to see some indictments and some arrests
[1:14:05.700 --> 1:14:10.260]  other Arthur Miller told us about this right there's only one way to end
[1:14:10.260 --> 1:14:13.900]  mass hysteria and that's public accountability for those who are guilty
[1:14:13.900 --> 1:14:18.180]  we have the left we have the right and they're fighting each other why because
[1:14:18.180 --> 1:14:22.060]  there's been no justice brought to either side I'm not saying the right's
[1:14:22.060 --> 1:14:26.100]  perfect I'm not saying well the left we know about but I'm saying no you're
[1:14:26.100 --> 1:14:29.260]  right they've gotten away with so much they're just mad dog crazy and now they're
[1:14:29.260 --> 1:14:32.780]  like we're gonna have sex with your kids you know we're gonna have a post-human
[1:14:32.780 --> 1:14:37.580]  world they're really gravitating wherever the worst thing is just a
[1:14:37.580 --> 1:14:44.220]  rebellious guy that's right and it's all public well Hillary Clinton cannot
[1:14:44.220 --> 1:14:46.700]  stand that and for people that are listening on the radio when you say
[1:14:46.700 --> 1:14:50.100]  in fours calm the first time her eyes close and then she just locks up and
[1:14:50.100 --> 1:14:53.660]  starts going like this I mean she cannot and again in fours is better than me
[1:14:53.660 --> 1:14:58.540]  or any of us it's all of us it's that idea of us standing up and saying no to
[1:14:58.540 --> 1:15:02.940]  them my friend I want to give you and I know you do this for money and I don't
[1:15:02.940 --> 1:15:05.580]  have enough to do it for everybody that goes out and does it like I did three
[1:15:05.580 --> 1:15:09.980]  years ago we spent almost $400,000 in thousand and $5,000 and $2,000 prices
[1:15:09.980 --> 1:15:13.300]  but I'm gonna start from time to time giving out an award as long as we can

[1:18:10.620 --> 1:18:16.020]  from their command base in England we've had Oxford come out in band clapping
[1:18:16.020 --> 1:18:20.580]  the ADL and others will literally bankrupt you kick you out of college

[1:18:59.980 --> 1:19:03.980]  what your views are I hope you articulate them and defend them and listen and
[1:19:03.980 --> 1:19:07.420]  debate them that's important but we have something in common we have a set of
[1:19:07.420 --> 1:19:10.220]  values that are at the core of this country that hold this place together
[1:19:10.220 --> 1:19:15.980]  Clinton deep-state bag man Comey thinks it's funny that he was the leaker and
[1:19:15.980 --> 1:19:20.260]  that he lied to Congress in the world he thinks committing crimes are funny and
[1:19:20.260 --> 1:19:25.140]  he thinks if he acts confident he won't get indicted but word is the criminal
[1:19:25.140 --> 1:19:31.980]  investigation is honing in on him from my new home in New Zealand I will
[1:19:31.980 --> 1:19:37.500]  oh and now suddenly he's talking about moving to New Zealand not so fast
[1:19:37.500 --> 1:19:41.180]  criminal we're going to bring you to justice and we're going to bring Hilary
[1:19:41.180 --> 1:19:46.020]  to justice as well because if we don't you criminals will continue to strike
[1:19:46.020 --> 1:19:49.620]  back at your enemy but the American people know how much you hate us and
[1:19:49.620 --> 1:19:56.420]  we're fighting back at info wars.com news wars.com and banned off video
[1:19:56.420 --> 1:20:21.900]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[1:20:21.900 --> 1:20:27.540]  if you are receiving this transmission you are the resistance
[1:20:27.540 --> 1:20:35.900]  live from the info wars.com studios it's alex jones now I obsessed over how
[1:20:35.900 --> 1:20:39.940]  Brian Stelter looks now Hilary Clinton looks because if I was a Hollywood
[1:20:39.940 --> 1:20:43.260]  producer and I was gonna pick somebody to be a child molester or a master
[1:20:43.260 --> 1:20:47.820]  criminal or really bad psychotic demon I would pick Brian Stelter or Hilary
[1:20:47.820 --> 1:20:52.140]  Clinton and when you watch the facial mannerisms and how they act and behave
[1:20:52.140 --> 1:20:58.700]  I've only seen that with truly psychotic people I've been around and
[1:20:58.700 --> 1:21:02.620]  unfortunately I did run into some real devil or spurs when I was younger I mean
[1:21:02.620 --> 1:21:06.300]  rich powerful people really obsessed with power and love of themselves
[1:21:06.300 --> 1:21:10.780]  Satanic narcissism is what I call it and only Hilary and only people like
[1:21:10.780 --> 1:21:15.140]  Brian Stelter exhibit it I went to Bohemian Grove and snuck in about half
[1:21:15.140 --> 1:21:19.980]  the participants were acting crazed and looking the same to somebody that isn't
[1:21:19.980 --> 1:21:24.140]  into this they look like a joke they look like a you know guy that is you
[1:21:24.140 --> 1:21:30.500]  know you want to hide your dog from but these people mean business and they want
[1:21:30.500 --> 1:21:34.900]  power so they seek power that's why they've got power Brandon Gray the full
[1:21:34.900 --> 1:21:39.140]  videos up on info wars.com and at your site just another channel.com and
[1:21:39.140 --> 1:21:44.660]  you're a patriot you are a father and you're somebody that you know is putting
[1:21:44.660 --> 1:21:47.540]  yourself out there in the public challenging this but just as you said
[1:21:47.540 --> 1:21:51.940]  as a veteran this is the real fight down here for America. Yeah that's right
[1:21:51.940 --> 1:21:56.380]  there's no guns or bombs in this civil war at least not yet and so the real
[1:21:56.380 --> 1:22:01.660]  soldiers are out there confronting these demons you know. My issue is we have to
[1:22:01.660 --> 1:22:04.580]  fight the information war or they're gonna push it to a physical war they're
[1:22:04.580 --> 1:22:08.220]  not gonna stop we have to decisively beat them now with the truth instead of
[1:22:08.220 --> 1:22:12.180]  it going to physical war which will win as well but I these people are such
[1:22:12.180 --> 1:22:16.940]  scum I don't have any desire to wipe them out. No none of us have a desire to
[1:22:16.940 --> 1:22:23.220]  you know have gunpowder set off in our country here on our you know there hasn't
[1:22:23.220 --> 1:22:27.420]  been a war here in a long time and I don't think anybody wants to see that.
[1:22:27.420 --> 1:22:32.060]  And our bloodiest wars have been domestic. Yeah and this one undoubtedly would
[1:22:32.060 --> 1:22:37.580]  be. You know like you said the left is begging for order to be brought in
[1:22:37.580 --> 1:22:40.620]  psychopaths do that they they keep they get more and more reckless till they get
[1:22:40.620 --> 1:22:44.940]  caught and they're begging for daddy to stand up. Yeah and a lot of us turn to
[1:22:44.940 --> 1:22:50.740]  Trump Trump's a great leader and hopefully we can see justice but I don't
[1:22:50.740 --> 1:22:54.300]  think we should just leave it up to him I don't think we should be reliant on
[1:22:54.300 --> 1:22:59.820]  waiting for Trump to take action. I think that's why Drudge is is making Trump not
[1:22:59.820 --> 1:23:03.780]  look like a god because he's not right we need to not count on Trump. He's done
[1:23:03.780 --> 1:23:07.820]  some good thing. We got Trump in. That's right I was gonna say the other day you
[1:23:07.820 --> 1:23:11.540]  said that you built the runway that launched Trump. Our audience did. Yeah
[1:23:11.540 --> 1:23:17.780]  what this audience and Info Wars also built the runway to launch American
[1:23:17.780 --> 1:23:21.580]  Patriots. You know we're just as important if not more important than
[1:23:21.580 --> 1:23:26.780]  Donald Trump. Damn right and and he knows that that's why they early on tried to
[1:23:26.780 --> 1:23:29.900]  isolate the Liberty Movement from Trump because it's so inclusive it's so open
[1:23:29.900 --> 1:23:32.940]  we can care less about what color you are it's what you stand for. Oh and what
[1:23:32.940 --> 1:23:36.860]  they did to Ron Paul and that Tea Party movement. Exactly. You know it's like
[1:23:36.860 --> 1:23:42.500]  come on those were Patriots. Those were Americans. It's sad to watch. I love
[1:23:42.500 --> 1:23:46.300]  Ron Paul. Absolutely it's amazing what they do. You were saying as you went
[1:23:46.300 --> 1:23:51.260]  out you go out and suddenly you hear Trump 2020 Info Wars.com so just inside
[1:23:51.260 --> 1:23:54.540]  and outside Hillary was under siege that's where this monster needs to be
[1:23:54.540 --> 1:24:02.100]  here's some more of the video. You guys should have seen the looks on some of
[1:24:02.100 --> 1:24:11.540]  those people's faces. Those are straight up demons. It's a den. A petty of
[1:24:11.540 --> 1:24:17.620]  straight up demons. I just got escorted off.
[1:24:21.620 --> 1:24:24.060]  Yes sir.
[1:24:24.060 --> 1:24:33.060]  Boys it's just all over the place. That was my next question and then you
[1:24:33.060 --> 1:24:37.140]  answered it. I mean I was looking at the people and they're so soft and they're
[1:24:37.140 --> 1:24:40.780]  so weird and they make little weird pervert faces and then wiggle their butts
[1:24:40.780 --> 1:24:46.460]  at you when they talk to you and they act like archetypal perverts pedophiles.
[1:24:46.460 --> 1:24:49.860]  I mean I'm sorry you go to an event they just look like the scum of the earth
[1:24:49.860 --> 1:24:52.940]  they're almost all white too but they're telling us how white people are bad. I
[1:24:52.940 --> 1:24:56.180]  guess these white people are bad. Well what's interesting is when I came home
[1:24:56.180 --> 1:24:59.780]  from this event I was able to watch some of Owen's footage they immediately
[1:24:59.780 --> 1:25:07.660]  attack him with like sexual related sexual based insults. Oh and I totally
[1:25:07.660 --> 1:25:13.500]  forgot I know Owen's out driving around town with the armored vehicle triggering
[1:25:13.500 --> 1:25:16.700]  Lib Tards but he had such amazing footage them physically attacking him can we
[1:25:16.700 --> 1:25:19.820]  find that sorry go ahead sorry. Yeah I'm glad you're reminding me that. And physical
[1:25:19.820 --> 1:25:23.100]  attacks you're right but there was a lady flipping him off telling him this is
[1:25:23.100 --> 1:25:27.900]  probably how big your Johnson is. Like what is where do these people go to see
[1:25:27.900 --> 1:25:31.380]  Hillary Clinton they get confronted politically and they immediately turn
[1:25:31.380 --> 1:25:37.060]  it sexual. What is up with that and these are these aren't young people. I mean
[1:25:37.060 --> 1:25:40.940]  I'll say it I love old women my mom's great and I've got three daughters women
[1:25:40.940 --> 1:25:45.020]  are great but the women that were there for Trump were wonderful amazing or a
[1:25:45.020 --> 1:25:48.460]  race color and creed but I'm sorry you go to a lettuce event people need to go
[1:25:48.460 --> 1:25:52.780]  see these people they look and act like mental patients. Oh yeah and I took my
[1:25:52.780 --> 1:25:56.660]  daughter to see Trump and Dallas which you were at as well I didn't know about
[1:25:56.660 --> 1:26:01.580]  that and the people there there were 80,000 plus people first of all second
[1:26:01.580 --> 1:26:04.860]  of all they were some of the nicest they were making they were making us cut in
[1:26:04.860 --> 1:26:08.900]  line because I had a little girl with me and I'd say no no we're fine we're fine
[1:26:08.900 --> 1:26:13.300]  right here. No you're going to the front of the line and these people were
[1:26:13.300 --> 1:26:18.060]  amazing and there's so much love and so much reality this is what humanity is
[1:26:18.060 --> 1:26:22.180]  like this is what America is like. Going to Trump rally you see the engine
[1:26:22.180 --> 1:26:26.220]  powering America and you see what the global sphere and yes it's a remnant of
[1:26:26.220 --> 1:26:30.020]  people of very race color and creed that have God in them but that light can
[1:26:30.020 --> 1:26:34.900]  spread quickly. That's why I see this drudge poll Hillary's beating Trump in
[1:26:34.900 --> 1:26:39.580]  a poll yeah right. Well remember the yeah it's a Fox poll the drudges covering
[1:26:39.580 --> 1:26:47.020]  and remember the New York Times had her at 97% their algorithm. Unreal who buys
[1:26:47.020 --> 1:26:51.540]  this stuff. Well they need us to believe it so when they have 20 million people
[1:26:51.540 --> 1:26:57.500]  vote in the names of dead yeah that then we believe he really lost yeah I mean
[1:26:57.500 --> 1:27:01.180]  he barely won because of election fraud and he had a landslide last time this
[1:27:01.180 --> 1:27:06.060]  time they're coming and I'm telling you gut level it's on a razor's edge and I
[1:27:06.060 --> 1:27:09.380]  mean I just keep saying that if people are overconfident but again we can't
[1:27:09.380 --> 1:27:13.100]  count on that if they take Trump down folks we just fight harder. Well not to
[1:27:13.100 --> 1:27:17.380]  mention you'll see these things going on like with with AISD and all these other
[1:27:17.380 --> 1:27:24.260]  initiatives. The story is always amidst backlash this is happening or amidst
[1:27:24.260 --> 1:27:27.660]  backlash. They're gonna teach eight-year-olds how to have anal sex and
[1:27:27.660 --> 1:27:32.500]  the teachers are gonna simulate it with bananas I mean if someone walked up to
[1:27:32.500 --> 1:27:35.460]  you at the park and did that they get their neck broken but it's the school
[1:27:35.460 --> 1:27:42.220]  doing it. Amidst backlash. Let's talk about the backlash right I mean my god
[1:27:42.220 --> 1:27:47.580]  this isn't getting voted on. Well my daughters used to roll their eyes at me
[1:27:47.580 --> 1:27:52.340]  some just two of them are older now 11 and 15 they now come to me and just
[1:27:52.340 --> 1:27:55.260]  listen to every word they go no I go to parties and other people that go to
[1:27:55.260 --> 1:27:59.020]  public school and and they and everyone comes up and says their teachers are
[1:27:59.020 --> 1:28:02.820]  teaching them how to have anal sex and and and and like all these girls at
[1:28:02.820 --> 1:28:05.780]  parties are saying we've all got to be lesbians and we love Hillary and they're
[1:28:05.780 --> 1:28:09.220]  like dad you never even taught us to hate those people my god these girls are
[1:28:09.220 --> 1:28:13.380]  more aggressive than mean guys and it's like the left are a bunch of pervert
[1:28:13.380 --> 1:28:18.340]  pushy scum. And the public is out there showing the curriculum that's being
[1:28:18.340 --> 1:28:20.980]  proposed and they're like where does it say in the curriculum that they're
[1:28:20.980 --> 1:28:24.700]  gonna be teaching them how to met and it doesn't say that in the official
[1:28:24.700 --> 1:28:27.660]  curriculum. But that's what they do in Canada four-year-olds are being asked
[1:28:27.660 --> 1:28:31.860]  their sexual preference in school. Brother you got to come on some of the
[1:28:31.860 --> 1:28:35.740]  other shows and we got to see out at the events more and more people go to these
[1:28:35.740 --> 1:28:38.900]  Democrat events whether it's a mayor or whether who doesn't matter they should be
[1:28:38.900 --> 1:28:42.780]  confronted everywhere but the fluoride the water in Austin. American Medical
[1:28:42.780 --> 1:28:45.940]  Associations is take it out they say screw you. God bless you brother. Bless you

[1:30:30.860 --> 1:30:35.340]  authoritarians and they're dangerous and the answer to their attack on speech is

[1:31:54.420 --> 1:32:00.980]  The Alex Jones Show. A few days ago my 11 year old daughter came to me and she
[1:32:00.980 --> 1:32:05.140]  had her digital textbook. She said dad they're teaching us about the periodic
[1:32:05.140 --> 1:32:09.360]  table and I clicked on iodine and it says that two billion people have low
[1:32:09.360 --> 1:32:13.020]  IQs or mentally retarded on the planet Earth because they didn't get enough
[1:32:13.020 --> 1:32:16.620]  iodine. That's what you say all the time but I've heard people say you're
[1:32:16.620 --> 1:32:20.700]  crazy and it's not true but dad it's right here on the periodic table when I
[1:32:20.700 --> 1:32:25.140]  click it saying exactly what you said and I said I know honey that's why I have
[1:32:25.140 --> 1:32:30.180]  you take the high-quality nutraceutical grade iodine is because it's why
[1:32:30.180 --> 1:32:35.100]  you're so vibrant it's why you're so alive it's it's one of the reasons that
[1:32:35.100 --> 1:32:38.820]  you're so much healthier and smarter than most of the kids your age and it
[1:32:38.820 --> 1:32:43.020]  just really blew her away to read it there for herself. They know that two
[1:32:43.020 --> 1:32:48.220]  billion people ladies and gentlemen two billion are mentally retarded on the
[1:32:48.220 --> 1:32:51.620]  face of the earth right now because of iodine deficiency. Research it and find

[1:33:56.620 --> 1:34:06.620]  Hillary Clinton is an enemy of the American people! Hillary Clinton is an enemy of America!
[1:34:06.620 --> 1:34:16.620]  Hillary Clinton is openly calling for censorship of all patronage and nationals. Hillary Clinton is a criminal.
[1:34:16.620 --> 1:34:31.620]  Hillary Clinton will never silence the American people. America is awake!
[1:34:31.620 --> 1:34:38.620]  America knows what's happening and InfoWars.com is exposing it!
[1:34:38.620 --> 1:34:51.620]  America is back! America is back!
[1:34:51.620 --> 1:35:09.620]  Hillary Clinton is an enemy of the American people.
[1:35:09.620 --> 1:35:24.620]  Hillary Clinton is a criminal.
[1:35:24.620 --> 1:35:30.620]  Ladies and gentlemen we are back live broadcasting worldwide and joining us is a man
[1:35:30.620 --> 1:35:37.180]  that the establishment is extremely afraid of. That's Gavin McInnes who found
[1:35:37.180 --> 1:35:42.820]  advice, who launched much of the modern hipster movement 20 years ago, got involved in major
[1:35:42.820 --> 1:35:49.180]  books, films, you name it, and silenced and demonized because he's so effective
[1:35:49.180 --> 1:35:53.780]  deprogramming the left. I would just call him a populist, a common-sense guy, I would even
[1:35:53.780 --> 1:35:59.420]  call him a conservative, I'd call him an American. Well, he founded the Proud Boys
[1:35:59.420 --> 1:36:03.380]  just to chauvinistically promote Western culture. They're open to everybody no matter
[1:36:03.380 --> 1:36:06.660]  what color you are, your sexual preference. They got demonized because they
[1:36:06.660 --> 1:36:10.340]  would fight back when Antifa attacked them. Antifa as you know last year attacked
[1:36:10.340 --> 1:36:14.180]  their folks in New York. Some of the Antifa got arrested but they attacked the
[1:36:14.180 --> 1:36:17.220]  other Proud Boys and got their ass kicked so they've now been sent to prison
[1:36:17.220 --> 1:36:23.220]  except for the brown Proud Boy. He was kept for another trial because the
[1:36:23.220 --> 1:36:29.020]  locals said in New York the police, the prosecutors said it would confuse the
[1:36:29.020 --> 1:36:34.980]  white supremacist narrative but they're trying to put him in jail. So we'll talk
[1:36:34.980 --> 1:36:40.300]  about David Kuriakusi coming up with Gavin McGinnis and then he's also
[1:36:40.300 --> 1:36:47.100]  covering in DC this week. Roger Stone's trial that starts tomorrow. For the
[1:36:47.100 --> 1:36:52.780]  Russia hoax, he's facing decades in prison with the same hanging judge that
[1:36:52.780 --> 1:36:57.700]  put Manafort in jail. So they're trying to put us in prison. First they take the
[1:36:57.700 --> 1:37:03.260]  speech, then they lock your ass up. Roger Stone's trial likely to be a
[1:37:03.260 --> 1:37:08.740]  spectacle. Okay ladies and gentlemen. Oh and who's gonna be the chief witness
[1:37:08.740 --> 1:37:12.700]  against him? I'll tell you about that in the next segment. But Gavin McGinnis, get
[1:37:12.700 --> 1:37:18.580]  off my lawn. The great work you're doing over at Free Speech TV. FreeSpeech.tv.
[1:37:18.580 --> 1:37:23.420]  Thank you so much for coming on with us. Thanks for having me, Alex. Wow. Where do
[1:37:23.420 --> 1:37:27.500]  you want to start here? Just the craziness. Hillary polling higher than
[1:37:27.500 --> 1:37:34.140]  Trump in a fox poll. It's crazy world. Well, the Roger Stone case and the Proud
[1:37:34.140 --> 1:37:38.380]  Boys case are very similar and Proud Boys often do security for Roger Stone
[1:37:38.380 --> 1:37:41.940]  for free. They follow him around and make sure he doesn't get beat up. He was
[1:37:41.940 --> 1:37:48.300]  just accosted on the plane on the way to DC from some random passenger. What
[1:37:48.300 --> 1:37:53.420]  happened with the Proud Boys was after weeks of terror and Antifa beat the
[1:37:53.420 --> 1:37:57.460]  crap out of a journalist, stole his stuff. These Antifa and Bush Proud Boys
[1:37:57.460 --> 1:38:02.700]  throw a bottle of urine at them. And yes, two of the ten did rush Antifa and
[1:38:02.700 --> 1:38:07.860]  say, Yeah, you want to fight? Fine. We're here. They have a consensual brawl and
[1:38:07.860 --> 1:38:12.220]  the rest of the guys show up and it ends in 17 seconds. But the first two guys
[1:38:12.220 --> 1:38:17.260]  who showed up, they're in a cage now in Ulster in upstate New York. Four years
[1:38:17.260 --> 1:38:21.980]  they'll be doing prison for a consensual brawl that lasted 17 seconds. This is
[1:38:21.980 --> 1:38:26.220]  just the beginning. And as you pointed out in that intro, there was actually
[1:38:26.220 --> 1:38:30.340]  three guys, sorry, four guys that are doing jail. One's in Rikers, two in
[1:38:30.340 --> 1:38:34.400]  prison. But then there was the brown guy. And you go, Well, why wasn't the brown
[1:38:34.400 --> 1:38:37.940]  guy with Max and John when they were sentenced? Oh, for some reason, it was
[1:38:37.940 --> 1:38:43.980]  pushed away because he is Indian. He's brown and that hurts the white power
[1:38:43.980 --> 1:38:48.820]  thing. The prosecution was all about hate and white supremacy. And when
[1:38:48.820 --> 1:38:52.460]  they were he was introduced to black, proud boys, he implied that they have
[1:38:52.460 --> 1:38:55.700]  mental problems. He said, I'm no psychiatrist, but there's something wrong
[1:38:55.700 --> 1:39:00.460]  with these guys. And I talked to John's wife, who is black? And he has three
[1:39:00.460 --> 1:39:04.340]  black kids. I thought it was four. It's only three. And she said every time
[1:39:04.340 --> 1:39:07.620]  that she would go near John and put her arm around him, the cameras would all
[1:39:07.620 --> 1:39:13.380]  drop. And then when she'd go pee, whoop, they came up taking pictures. They take
[1:39:13.380 --> 1:39:17.620]  a picture of him like this and they go low. So it looks like a Zeig Heil. And
[1:39:17.620 --> 1:39:21.420]  the scary part here is we knew the media was biased. We knew that Buzzfeed and
[1:39:21.420 --> 1:39:26.300]  Huffbo are activists, not journalists. But now they're in cahoots. They are
[1:39:26.300 --> 1:39:31.140]  colluding with the prosecution, with the judge, with the governor. It's all one
[1:39:31.140 --> 1:39:37.860]  big fiery ball of crap that is burning us alive. I mean, these two guys are just
[1:39:37.860 --> 1:39:42.780]  the beginning. Roger Stone is just the beginning. Let me add this. I never
[1:39:42.780 --> 1:39:46.500]  got to this yesterday. I meant to Charlie Warzel used to work at the fake news
[1:39:46.500 --> 1:39:49.820]  outlet Buzzfeed has moved on to bigger fake news. He had a big article in the
[1:39:49.820 --> 1:39:54.900]  New York Times saying it's time for leftist memers to activate. And he
[1:39:54.900 --> 1:39:57.900]  basically implies it's time to be more deceptive than Republicans and the
[1:39:57.900 --> 1:40:01.940]  comments are all, yeah, let's lie better than them. We're not lying. We're
[1:40:01.940 --> 1:40:07.300]  showing what you're doing. And then to get them all lined up to unify their
[1:40:07.300 --> 1:40:11.540]  lies, they go, well, we've got to lie because they do. Can Democrats compete?
[1:40:11.540 --> 1:40:16.700]  The headline is with Trump's Twitter. And then it goes on to basically push more
[1:40:16.700 --> 1:40:21.380]  censorship as well. I mean, these guys are so authoritarian. You know what
[1:40:21.380 --> 1:40:24.140]  they're calling a lie, by the way, they're calling a lie that picture of the
[1:40:24.140 --> 1:40:29.500]  dog getting the medal. That's called a joke. You dummies, you journalists
[1:40:29.500 --> 1:40:33.740]  scouring the metal has a paw on it. It was admittedly a joke. Well, they know
[1:40:33.740 --> 1:40:38.820]  what they're doing. They're trying to make humor illegal. Yes, they want
[1:40:38.820 --> 1:40:42.740]  clown world is gray and they don't want any color in clown world. I was
[1:40:42.740 --> 1:40:46.180]  watching your clip today with you. I didn't know such a vehicle existed. You
[1:40:46.180 --> 1:40:50.580]  could have a submarine top in a truck, but I was watching you go down that
[1:40:50.580 --> 1:40:55.060]  highway and I was like, that's color. That's interesting. And even the
[1:40:55.060 --> 1:40:59.420]  Hillary supporters who are going boo boo, they were having fun. I was like,
[1:40:59.420 --> 1:41:04.420]  this is the America I know people yelling boo is almost like a wwe thing. It
[1:41:04.420 --> 1:41:08.780]  was very enjoyable to watch. Alex. Nice job with that. Oh, we had a great time.
[1:41:08.780 --> 1:41:12.140]  And it went on for hours and hours with us bullhorning them and just
[1:41:12.140 --> 1:41:16.260]  educating them and exercising and Hillary got confronted inside about all
[1:41:16.260 --> 1:41:17.540]  her husband and her crimes.
[1:41:18.740 --> 1:41:22.940]  Beautiful. Yeah, it's so true that that they think that we're lying. So they
[1:41:22.940 --> 1:41:26.740]  want to lie back with the proud boys thing. For example, we don't go to
[1:41:26.740 --> 1:41:31.220]  their events. Mark Bray wrote the Antifa handbook. He did a book tour all
[1:41:31.220 --> 1:41:34.860]  over the country. Not one proud boy could be bothered going there. They
[1:41:34.860 --> 1:41:39.460]  come to our things and attack us. And then we fight back and we're just as
[1:41:39.460 --> 1:41:43.540]  violent as them. Sargon of a cod who I thought was a friend just did a whole
[1:41:43.540 --> 1:41:47.220]  video about how Antifa and proud boys should be punished because they start
[1:41:47.220 --> 1:41:51.140]  fights and Max and John will only do prison for a few years. Oh, is that
[1:41:51.140 --> 1:41:54.980]  all a few years for a bar room brawl? Yeah, that sounds reasonable. And
[1:41:54.980 --> 1:41:59.540]  Tifa is the guy who just got six years. He had a steel pole and he's opened
[1:41:59.540 --> 1:42:05.860]  up the head of a man to his skull and did it from behind. That's an attack.
[1:42:05.980 --> 1:42:10.180]  We're not attacking. And this is crap about us being racist. We're
[1:42:10.220 --> 1:42:15.420]  multiracial, gays, Jews. In fact, they all know that, Gavin. They're going
[1:42:15.420 --> 1:42:18.660]  with the race based initiative as the WikiLeaks says. Hillary's talking to
[1:42:18.660 --> 1:42:22.180]  this top professor of psychology and they say it's time to intensify
[1:42:22.180 --> 1:42:26.860]  culture war. And that's what this is. Yeah, do they care about the truth? I
[1:42:26.860 --> 1:42:31.420]  mean, remember that Muhammad video guy? No one knew what his violation was.
[1:42:31.420 --> 1:42:35.100]  No one knew what he did. What the actual crime that put him in jail for a
[1:42:35.100 --> 1:42:39.140]  year was that in Boston, the Cooley, boss, the guy. It was something to do
[1:42:39.140 --> 1:42:42.740]  with violating parole and using a fake name. They spotted like he went to
[1:42:42.740 --> 1:42:47.940]  prison for making a video about Muhammad in America. Gavin McGinnis is our
[1:42:47.940 --> 1:42:50.780]  guest. Stay with us. We'll be right back in just a few minutes.
[1:42:50.780 --> 1:42:59.860]  Yeah, the time has come to defy the thought police. They are banning
[1:42:59.860 --> 1:43:03.500]  hundreds and hundreds of symbols every year. They're waging war on
[1:43:03.500 --> 1:43:08.580]  communication itself as the Fabian socialist promise they would do more
[1:43:08.580 --> 1:43:13.500]  than 70 years ago from their command base in England. We've had Oxford
[1:43:13.500 --> 1:43:18.500]  come out in band clapping. The ADL and others will literally bankrupt you,
[1:43:18.500 --> 1:43:22.140]  kick you out of college, destroy you, have you arrested in some areas. If
[1:43:22.140 --> 1:43:26.060]  you do the okay symbol that's the international sign language symbol
[1:43:26.060 --> 1:43:29.940]  for okay, they know what they're doing. These people are
[1:43:29.940 --> 1:43:33.900]  authoritarians and they're dangerous. And the answer to their attack on
[1:43:33.900 --> 1:43:38.580]  speech is to exercise it in their face. We have a it's okay to be okay
[1:43:38.580 --> 1:43:42.060]  politically incorrect ball cap. It's black and white. Very nice as the
[1:43:42.060 --> 1:43:45.660]  okay symbol on it. It's a great way to start conversations in full wars

[1:43:55.580 --> 1:43:59.460]  Hosts ask me, Alex, why do you have two different types of iodine? Well,
[1:43:59.460 --> 1:44:03.460]  that's because different types of physiology is different types of
[1:44:03.460 --> 1:44:08.420]  metabolic systems and people will like different formulas. It's just that
[1:44:08.460 --> 1:44:13.140]  simple. X three is the deep earth crystal iodine and two other types
[1:44:13.140 --> 1:44:18.060]  because some people need all three types to absorb others like the pure
[1:44:18.100 --> 1:44:22.340]  atomic iodine. Get both. They're both great for you, whichever one you
[1:44:22.340 --> 1:44:27.500]  like, use that and give the other to family or friends. Bottom line, iodine
[1:44:27.500 --> 1:44:31.340]  is essential. That's why I harp on it. The globalist want you to be
[1:44:31.340 --> 1:44:36.060]  deficient in it for a lot of reasons. Lower IQ makes you sluggish. You
[1:44:36.060 --> 1:44:39.340]  don't live as long. It's simple. Get your high quality iodine info or

[1:44:48.100 --> 1:44:52.540]  challenge. Both types of iodine with selenium for 60% off together.
[1:44:54.860 --> 1:44:58.180]  We have strong disagreement on policy grounds and I hope there's
[1:44:58.180 --> 1:45:01.860]  diversity and policy here. I don't care what your views are. I hope you
[1:45:01.860 --> 1:45:04.540]  articulate them and defend them and listen and debate them. That's
[1:45:04.540 --> 1:45:08.140]  important, but we have something in common. We have a set of values that
[1:45:08.140 --> 1:45:11.260]  are at the core of this country that hold this place together. Clinton
[1:45:11.260 --> 1:45:16.020]  deep state bag man. Comey thinks it's funny that he was the leaker and
[1:45:16.020 --> 1:45:19.580]  that he lied to Congress in the world. He thinks committing crimes are
[1:45:19.580 --> 1:45:24.060]  funny and he thinks if he acts confident, he won't get indicted. Word
[1:45:24.060 --> 1:45:28.900]  is the criminal investigation is honing in on him from my new home in
[1:45:28.900 --> 1:45:35.500]  New Zealand. I will Oh, and now suddenly he's talking about moving to
[1:45:35.500 --> 1:45:39.420]  New Zealand. Not so fast criminal. We're going to bring you to
[1:45:39.420 --> 1:45:42.820]  justice and we're going to bring Hillary justice as well. Because if we
[1:45:42.820 --> 1:45:47.300]  don't, you criminals will continue to strike back at your enemy. But the
[1:45:47.300 --> 1:45:50.740]  American people know how much you hate us and we're fighting back at
[1:45:50.740 --> 1:45:56.940]  info wars dot com news wars dot com and ban dot video. Here's the bad news.

[1:47:00.620 --> 1:47:01.220]  show.
[1:47:10.860 --> 1:47:15.940]  The Alex Jones show because there is a war on for your mind.
[1:47:15.940 --> 1:47:21.500]  Well, yeah, McGinnis has launched a whole lot of successful businesses,
[1:47:21.500 --> 1:47:27.140]  magazines, TV networks, publications. And he's a very likeable guy, even more so
[1:47:27.140 --> 1:47:33.300]  in person, very charming, very funny. And you know, it's he's fun on an item of
[1:47:33.300 --> 1:47:37.540]  the town or in the studio or, you know, going fishing. And that's why they don't
[1:47:37.540 --> 1:47:40.700]  like him. It's why they want him silence. He's one of the most silent people
[1:47:40.700 --> 1:47:45.260]  out there five months ago when Facebook said my name is banned and website is
[1:47:45.260 --> 1:47:50.500]  banned in any positive mention. They said because he had Gavin McInnes on that
[1:47:50.500 --> 1:47:55.260]  was the final straw was I had this, this, this, this tyrannosaurus, this
[1:47:55.260 --> 1:48:00.100]  Godzilla, this death dealer on because again, they want to demonize him. They
[1:48:00.100 --> 1:48:04.300]  don't want him to have a voice to say who he really is. They want to have total
[1:48:04.300 --> 1:48:08.580]  air superiority to destroy you. And now Roger Stone has been gagged by this
[1:48:08.580 --> 1:48:12.620]  Obama hanging judge that says everybody right to present. They finally want to
[1:48:12.620 --> 1:48:17.900]  have some type of scalp they get from Russia gave said a 13 made up indicted
[1:48:17.900 --> 1:48:21.540]  Russians. You're going to be in DC starting I guess tomorrow covering it.
[1:48:21.540 --> 1:48:25.460]  We've got reporters there covering it. What in the hell is going on? Because
[1:48:25.460 --> 1:48:30.540]  this ties in to all the other attacks with shifts committee and reading fake
[1:48:30.540 --> 1:48:33.460]  transcripts. I mean, this is hoax world, Gavin.
[1:48:34.940 --> 1:48:37.980]  You know, it goes back to what I was saying about the Nisula Bakuli
[1:48:37.980 --> 1:48:42.900]  Nusla guy. People just want to they wanted they want scalps. They want to
[1:48:42.900 --> 1:48:47.980]  win all fair and love and war. And the left has decided truth be damned. I
[1:48:47.980 --> 1:48:51.380]  need to win. I need to win this election. I think like they've never
[1:48:51.380 --> 1:48:55.660]  criticized Trump's actual policies. They focus on his typos and stuff. So they
[1:48:55.660 --> 1:49:00.220]  don't actually dislike Trump. They hate that they lost. That's what this comes
[1:49:00.220 --> 1:49:04.220]  down to. So Roger Stone is a Trump guy. Let's throw him in jail. Not one
[1:49:04.220 --> 1:49:08.460]  person. I haven't heard one person describe exactly what he did wrong. You
[1:49:08.460 --> 1:49:12.340]  know what he did wrong? He was asked, did you get an email from Julian Assange
[1:49:12.500 --> 1:49:17.860]  out of the thousands of emails he gets a day during the campaign? He did get an
[1:49:17.860 --> 1:49:22.300]  email from Julian Assange. He said he didn't. He was mistaken. That counts
[1:49:22.340 --> 1:49:26.380]  as lying under oath. What was the email? Did the email say, Hey, I'm going to
[1:49:26.380 --> 1:49:30.420]  leak Hillary's emails. Should I do that? Yes. No, it was some innocuous thing
[1:49:30.420 --> 1:49:34.540]  about. Did you get the thing on Friday to go to the do Hickey? Just boring,
[1:49:34.660 --> 1:49:40.500]  irrelevant detail email. But technically it is a lie. If you say you
[1:49:40.500 --> 1:49:44.140]  didn't and you did. So they're throwing the book at him. No one actually
[1:49:44.140 --> 1:49:47.820]  looks at the actual crime anymore. Our justice system. The way I describe it
[1:49:47.820 --> 1:49:53.140]  to people now is think of Uganda. Like this isn't about justice and, you
[1:49:53.140 --> 1:49:56.820]  know, top level geniuses handling all this stuff. It's just like with the
[1:49:56.820 --> 1:50:00.620]  proud boys case, it was these guys racist, get rid of the black guy, take a
[1:50:00.620 --> 1:50:04.260]  picture of him, make sure his wife, his black wife is in with him, then call him
[1:50:04.260 --> 1:50:07.860]  a Nazi and put him in the jail. And then the jury goes, Oh, I hate Nazis. Yeah,
[1:50:07.860 --> 1:50:13.820]  yeah, throw him in jail. Zero nuance. It's like watching idiocracy where they
[1:50:13.820 --> 1:50:17.540]  have that trial scene. And he's like, you're my lawyer is supposed to be
[1:50:17.540 --> 1:50:22.300]  defending me. He goes, he talks like a fag. That's what it's come down to. It
[1:50:22.300 --> 1:50:26.740]  really has. And you you peel back. I mean, there's there's two things going on.
[1:50:26.740 --> 1:50:29.940]  There is the deep state and Jeffrey Epstein didn't kill himself and rock.
[1:50:29.940 --> 1:50:35.100]  The it's really deep. The people who are are trying to smother Roger Stone.
[1:50:35.100 --> 1:50:42.420]  But there's also this massive swath of just dumb losers that want to please
[1:50:42.420 --> 1:50:46.220]  Cuomo de Blasio, the attorney general, and they go, Oh, I'll get rid of that
[1:50:46.220 --> 1:50:51.180]  guy for you, boss. I mean, it's sort of like boss tweed and gang. No, you're
[1:50:51.180 --> 1:50:54.740]  right. There's all these minions that just line up without even having orders
[1:50:54.740 --> 1:50:58.460]  from headquarters without even getting anything from the system. But they want
[1:50:58.460 --> 1:51:02.820]  to take down Alex Jones, get him again as Roger Stone, President Trump. And we
[1:51:02.820 --> 1:51:06.940]  are amongst the most hated. Why do you think just a few of us are the most
[1:51:06.940 --> 1:51:07.300]  hated?
[1:51:08.580 --> 1:51:13.140]  Masculinity, I think that we have a very feminized culture. And guys like you
[1:51:13.140 --> 1:51:15.980]  and me, when we say make America great again, we're kind of talking about the
[1:51:15.980 --> 1:51:19.620]  80s. We're talking about jet skis and mullets and wraparound sunglasses. And
[1:51:19.620 --> 1:51:23.420]  we're not. We don't think bullying is the end of the world. And they have sort
[1:51:23.420 --> 1:51:28.180]  of been living in this revenge of the nerds culture where stand up comedians
[1:51:28.180 --> 1:51:32.140]  who are bald and wear glasses are considered rock stars. And we're
[1:51:32.140 --> 1:51:36.620]  saying, No, you're kind of a dweeb. And the idea of men being proud of
[1:51:36.620 --> 1:51:40.860]  themselves and men enjoying masculinity and men saying, Don't cry, you baby.
[1:51:41.180 --> 1:51:45.900]  It blows their mind because their whole existence is predicated on toxic
[1:51:45.900 --> 1:51:50.620]  masculinity. So once we say, No, it's not toxic. Their whole world starts to
[1:51:50.620 --> 1:51:53.740]  crumble. That's why they hate Trump because he's masculine and he's
[1:51:53.740 --> 1:51:56.540]  unashamed. Well, it's like the Grand Torino is such a good movie because
[1:51:56.540 --> 1:52:01.140]  it actually shows the guys at the different construction sites talking
[1:52:01.140 --> 1:52:04.180]  crap to each other as a way to blow off steam. It's just fun. It's just what
[1:52:04.180 --> 1:52:07.460]  men do. And then the young kid doesn't figure it out for a while. Finally
[1:52:07.460 --> 1:52:10.980]  does these leftist. It's not just being messed with by older men or
[1:52:10.980 --> 1:52:14.620]  something in a rite of passage. They can't handle a joke. They don't like
[1:52:14.620 --> 1:52:18.220]  these people are crazy. But then their authoritarians that want to take all
[1:52:18.220 --> 1:52:21.180]  our freedom so their feelings don't get hurt. But then they're the ones
[1:52:21.180 --> 1:52:24.820]  calling us all these horrible names and taking our bank accounts away. They're
[1:52:24.820 --> 1:52:25.820]  the real bullies.
[1:52:26.940 --> 1:52:30.180]  Throwing us in jail, taking our bank accounts away. It's a lot like North
[1:52:30.180 --> 1:52:35.580]  Korea in that you have this fat, ugly loser taking over everyone's freedom
[1:52:35.580 --> 1:52:39.300]  and saying, No, I want to be the king. I want to ride a horse to the top of
[1:52:39.300 --> 1:52:44.140]  the summit. Isn't that ironic too that in our utopia, yours and mine, Alex,
[1:52:44.140 --> 1:52:49.100]  we're not about follow my rules. Go by my thing. Make sure that you can only
[1:52:49.100 --> 1:52:54.540]  watch info wars. We want as Mal would say 100 flowers to bloom. We want total
[1:52:54.540 --> 1:52:59.380]  freedom, bad guys, good guys. Everyone gets a say in the war of ideas, the
[1:52:59.380 --> 1:53:03.980]  war, the battleground of ideas. Our ideas are superior and confident. And
[1:53:03.980 --> 1:53:08.060]  that's why they don't want us on the field. And if you disagree with me,
[1:53:08.060 --> 1:53:11.100]  well, then let's discuss it. Oh, no, I can't discuss it. You took away my
[1:53:11.100 --> 1:53:15.540]  voice. Oh, okay. Well, I guess your, your narrative is the dominant one.
[1:53:17.740 --> 1:53:23.060]  I asked you this question like four years ago. I said, What is peak SJW? I
[1:53:23.060 --> 1:53:26.740]  thought it would be craziness. No, it's authoritarianism. It's dominance. It's
[1:53:26.740 --> 1:53:31.860]  control. It's the new thing they call it drag queen is not a guy doing a
[1:53:31.940 --> 1:53:36.700]  number as a woman. That's funny. It's dudes dressed like vampire demons,
[1:53:36.700 --> 1:53:43.380]  simulating killing babies and or trying to have sex with children. Yeah. And
[1:53:43.380 --> 1:53:47.180]  it's, you always ask me how does it get worse? When will it escalate? I don't
[1:53:47.180 --> 1:53:50.940]  know, man. I was talking to someone in Chile the other day and she said, This
[1:53:50.940 --> 1:53:55.740]  revolution happened overnight. It's kind of reminiscent of the revolution in
[1:53:55.740 --> 1:54:00.020]  Iran. That was basically a couple days. I mean, we didn't have time to protect
[1:54:00.020 --> 1:54:04.220]  the American embassy. They overran the American embassy. That's how quick it
[1:54:04.220 --> 1:54:07.860]  was. And Chile was the same thing. And when you look at the way it went over,
[1:54:08.020 --> 1:54:12.620]  it went down over there, you think this seems like it was, it was created
[1:54:12.660 --> 1:54:16.140]  externally. And then you go, Well, I guess it's just a coincidence that we
[1:54:16.140 --> 1:54:20.660]  have the riots in Venezuela and in Hong Kong. And we have the riots with the
[1:54:20.660 --> 1:54:24.460]  Catalan's in Spain. There's riots in hundreds of countries. The majority of
[1:54:24.460 --> 1:54:29.380]  countries have giant unprecedented riots. It's just starting to feel like the
[1:54:29.380 --> 1:54:35.380]  globalists have gone into def con for and have now said, All right, pull the
[1:54:35.380 --> 1:54:40.180]  lever. Let's really get it going because it's going man. Oh, they admit Soros
[1:54:40.780 --> 1:54:43.580]  and all these other groups are pumping billions and billions into just
[1:54:43.620 --> 1:54:49.980]  uprisings everywhere. We had 1000 people in Brooklyn furious that they are
[1:54:49.980 --> 1:54:54.220]  starting to prosecute turnstile jumpers and they're holding signs and say
[1:54:54.220 --> 1:54:58.460]  things like the subway should be free. What? How does that work? What are you
[1:54:58.460 --> 1:55:03.300]  talking about? And that was 1000 people in Brooklyn talking about killing pigs
[1:55:03.420 --> 1:55:09.820]  with big pictures of pigs wearing police hats for turnstile jumpers. What they
[1:55:09.820 --> 1:55:12.460]  wouldn't like it about walked in their little store and grabbed the sandwich
[1:55:12.460 --> 1:55:16.100]  oven walked out and said this is free. But again, none of those folks have real
[1:55:16.100 --> 1:55:19.980]  jobs. They don't get it. They literally believe there's a magic machine. Did you
[1:55:19.980 --> 1:55:23.340]  see Elizabeth Warren's new site where the calculator gives you whatever answer
[1:55:23.340 --> 1:55:28.060]  you want and everything's free? Yeah, I saw even SNL was making fun of that
[1:55:28.060 --> 1:55:32.420]  because it was so patently absurd. They don't have a solution. They want to
[1:55:32.420 --> 1:55:36.340]  burn America to the ground with zero plan B and then the globalist can build
[1:55:36.340 --> 1:55:39.660]  it up in their image. We can use their clothing companies, their energy
[1:55:39.660 --> 1:55:44.420]  providers, their health care systems, their everything, their infrastructure.
[1:55:44.540 --> 1:55:49.020]  Now they decide and it's like a more just world because they'll be making
[1:55:49.020 --> 1:55:52.700]  sure that no one is bad and everyone is well behaved. We're gonna go to break

[1:56:02.260 --> 1:56:05.860]  don't forget you can see him and a lot of other great shows that still exist

[1:56:09.820 --> 1:56:12.980]  dot TV. And when I say our infrastructure, I don't own that. I don't have a
[1:56:12.980 --> 1:56:16.900]  piece of it, but I feel like it's mine because free speech is all of ours and
[1:56:16.900 --> 1:56:20.420]  the more of it, the better. And in this attempt to shut everybody down. It's
[1:56:20.420 --> 1:56:23.660]  exciting. The great work he and others are doing because who knows if they shut
[1:56:23.660 --> 1:56:26.420]  me down, they're really trying. I don't think it's gonna happen. But I was
[1:56:26.420 --> 1:56:30.380]  already asking Gavin just this other day on the task. Can I get a job? We're

[2:00:12.580 --> 2:00:17.860]  and he's read fake transcripts in the committee like they're real. And now
[2:00:17.860 --> 2:00:20.860]  he's saying, Oh, you might be able to ask questions secretly at the whistle
[2:00:20.860 --> 2:00:24.020]  blower. It turns out all these other fake whistle blowers are minions of
[2:00:24.020 --> 2:00:28.380]  Brennan and Hillary and clapper. Here's just some of Schiff getting away with
[2:00:28.380 --> 2:00:30.420]  it over a month and a half ago. So why not do more
[2:00:30.420 --> 2:00:35.940]  without objection? The chair reserves the right to recess the hearing at any
[2:00:35.940 --> 2:00:36.460]  time.
[2:00:38.340 --> 2:00:41.900]  The presidential oath of office requires the president of the United
[2:00:41.900 --> 2:00:48.100]  States to do two things. Faithfully execute his or her office and protect
[2:00:48.100 --> 2:00:49.740]  and defend the Constitution.
[2:00:50.980 --> 2:00:54.260]  At oath, of course, cannot be honored if the president does not first
[2:00:54.260 --> 2:00:59.380]  defend the country. If our national security is jeopardized, if our country
[2:00:59.380 --> 2:01:04.660]  is left undefended, the necessity to faithfully execute the office becomes
[2:01:04.660 --> 2:01:09.220]  moot, where there is no country and there is no office to execute.
[2:01:10.380 --> 2:01:14.340]  And so the duty to defend the nation is foundational to the president's
[2:01:14.340 --> 2:01:15.500]  responsibilities.
[2:01:17.020 --> 2:01:21.460]  But what of this second responsibility to defend the Constitution?
[2:01:22.580 --> 2:01:27.100]  What does that really mean? The founders were not speaking, of course, of a
[2:01:27.100 --> 2:01:31.580]  piece of parchment. And again, he then goes on to read the fake transcript,
[2:01:31.580 --> 2:01:34.460]  which we're live now. We're going to add it in post later so it can grow. It
[2:01:34.460 --> 2:01:39.380]  makes sense. But everybody's seeing it. Everybody knows about it. If you'll do
[2:01:39.380 --> 2:01:40.620]  that, where is this going?
[2:01:43.780 --> 2:01:45.820]  Yeah, I'm asking me. Yeah, I'm asking you.
[2:01:47.420 --> 2:01:51.060]  I think that he could get impeached to this point. Things have changed
[2:01:51.060 --> 2:01:56.620]  drastically even in the past couple months. It used to be, ha ha, you crazy
[2:01:56.620 --> 2:02:00.580]  liberals are acting so unhinged with such severe Trump derangement syndrome
[2:02:00.700 --> 2:02:04.380]  that you're getting him reelected in a landslide. And that's what Donald
[2:02:04.380 --> 2:02:09.060]  Trump Jr. keeps repeating. But I'm at the point now where I think that these
[2:02:09.060 --> 2:02:13.620]  lunatics could actually win. I think if Trump wins the next election, he'll
[2:02:13.620 --> 2:02:18.060]  squeak by. And I would say there's a one in two chance he gets impeached at
[2:02:18.060 --> 2:02:21.180]  this point. Jonah Goldberg over the national review was saying his only
[2:02:21.180 --> 2:02:24.740]  hope is to apologize. That's the only way he's going to get out of this mess.
[2:02:24.740 --> 2:02:27.980]  These people are very effective. And maybe it's because they have Soros
[2:02:27.980 --> 2:02:33.820]  money. I don't know why. But how about some culpability on us? How about our
[2:02:33.820 --> 2:02:37.940]  side? Like when the Proud Boys were on trial there, there was no right wing
[2:02:37.940 --> 2:02:42.140]  media sites there at all. There was HuffPo. There was Daily Beast. There was
[2:02:42.140 --> 2:02:46.220]  Buzzfeed. There was Daily News. They were all there constructing their stupid
[2:02:46.220 --> 2:02:51.180]  Nazi story. But where were our guys? Where was Breitbart? Where was it? Where
[2:02:51.180 --> 2:02:56.700]  was Daily Caller? And now you have Matt Drudge sort of capitulating to the
[2:02:56.700 --> 2:03:01.060]  whole Never Trump thing. I think that we, we'd like to talk about the left and
[2:03:01.060 --> 2:03:06.900]  how evil they are. We have become pussies and we are too easily defeated.
[2:03:07.060 --> 2:03:11.020]  That's one of the biggest problems with this mess we're in. It's our fault.
[2:03:14.100 --> 2:03:17.940]  Well, Gavin, you're absolutely right. And if we don't stand up this
[2:03:17.940 --> 2:03:23.060]  authoritarianism, Trump will actually trigger something worse because it got
[2:03:23.060 --> 2:03:27.140]  the left so wound up and so evil to truly manifest themselves that they've
[2:03:27.140 --> 2:03:30.860]  gone right to the end game now. And if we submit to them now, they're talking
[2:03:30.860 --> 2:03:34.460]  about just total domination of every facet of our lives. And there's such
[2:03:34.460 --> 2:03:38.740]  weak, pathetic people that they have a hunger for that raw power and are the
[2:03:38.740 --> 2:03:42.740]  worst type of folks you don't want to have any power. And so now we have
[2:03:42.740 --> 2:03:48.420]  really got to finish our work. It's like we're being bullied by these
[2:03:48.420 --> 2:03:54.820]  tyrannical ugly brat nerds. Like, imagine the worst. I mean, I like the
[2:03:54.820 --> 2:04:00.940]  Kim Jong-un analogy. Imagine the worst kind of vindictive little chubby
[2:04:00.980 --> 2:04:05.620]  turd, giving, being given infinite power. I mean, look at Schiff's face. You
[2:04:05.620 --> 2:04:08.860]  know what it was like for him in high school. The guy was never down off the
[2:04:08.860 --> 2:04:11.660]  basketball nets. He must have been hanging there by his underwear every
[2:04:11.660 --> 2:04:16.620]  single morning. And now he wants revenge on all those wedge years. And if we
[2:04:16.620 --> 2:04:21.180]  were worth our salt, we would just say, go sit down, Schiff. But we don't. We
[2:04:21.180 --> 2:04:25.940]  go, oh, no, don't call me a Nazi. Like Judge DeNene Pirro was just in Hawaii.
[2:04:25.940 --> 2:04:29.420]  And there was this proud boy, Nick Ox, there. And she goes, oh, he's a proud
[2:04:29.420 --> 2:04:32.220]  boy. Get him fired. I don't want to be associated with him. Get him fired. And
[2:04:32.220 --> 2:04:36.300]  they went, oh, OK, you're fired. You know, even if it's any way to panic and
[2:04:36.300 --> 2:04:41.420]  just, and just virtue signal, oh, let me prove I'm groveling to the system when
[2:04:41.420 --> 2:04:45.340]  all you do is encourage the bullies. Gavin McGinnis, God bless you. My friend,
[2:04:45.340 --> 2:04:48.140]  look forward to speaking to you again very, very soon. A lot of big stuff
[2:04:48.140 --> 2:04:51.660]  coming up and your coverage of the upcoming Roger Stone witch trial. Free
[2:04:51.660 --> 2:04:58.300]  speech.tv. Folks ask me, Alex, why do you have two different types of iodine?
[2:04:58.300 --> 2:05:02.460]  Well, that's because different types of physiologies, different types of
[2:05:02.460 --> 2:05:07.340]  metabolic systems and people will like different formulas. It's just that
[2:05:07.340 --> 2:05:12.780]  simple. X3 is the deep earth crystal iodine and two other types because some
[2:05:12.780 --> 2:05:18.780]  people need all three types to absorb. Others like the pure atomic iodine. Get
[2:05:18.780 --> 2:05:22.860]  both. They're both great for you. Whichever one you like, use that and give
[2:05:22.860 --> 2:05:27.740]  the other to family or friends. Bottom line, iodine is essential. That's why I
[2:05:27.740 --> 2:05:32.620]  harp on it. The globalist want you to be deficient in it for a lot of reasons.
[2:05:32.620 --> 2:05:37.420]  Lower IQ, makes you sluggish. You don't live as long. It's simple. Get your high
[2:05:37.420 --> 2:05:43.180]  quality iodine at infowarstore.com and help fund the info war. infowarstore.com.
[2:05:43.180 --> 2:05:47.140]  We've got a huge sale running right now, but it's about to end. It's the iodine
[2:05:47.140 --> 2:06:04.140]  challenge. Both types of iodine with selenium for 60% off together.
[2:06:04.140 --> 2:06:10.140]  Big brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups. You want to stop
[2:06:10.140 --> 2:06:19.300]  tyranny? Well, so does he. Live from the infowarstore.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[2:06:20.020 --> 2:06:25.300]  Facebook and Instagram banned conspiracy theorist Alex Jones. I am now
[2:06:25.300 --> 2:06:28.940]  completely banned. Now, info wars, of course, is that web show and website led by
[2:06:28.940 --> 2:06:32.740]  Rachel Hollick, Alex Jones. I want them shut down. I want them silenced. I want
[2:06:32.740 --> 2:06:35.780]  them muted. I think they are horrible for our society. These people aren't
[2:06:35.780 --> 2:06:39.700]  terrifying or anything. There's also guys on CNN that spend their whole day
[2:06:39.700 --> 2:06:43.980]  calling Facebook and saying, can you ban this person? These are very extreme
[2:06:43.980 --> 2:06:47.380]  individuals and no matter what anyone tells you, they are extremists and that's
[2:06:47.380 --> 2:06:50.980]  why Facebook decided to get rid of them. Basically, they've deemed these
[2:06:50.980 --> 2:06:54.660]  individuals to be dangerous is what Facebook is saying. Those individuals
[2:06:54.660 --> 2:06:58.420]  include people like right-wing conspiracy theorist Alex Jones. Organizations like
[2:06:58.420 --> 2:07:02.700]  Media Matters have pointed out consistently how Alex Jones and other
[2:07:02.700 --> 2:07:08.740]  info wars pages had just simply circumvented any ban by starting a
[2:07:08.740 --> 2:07:12.340]  different account or going on Instagram. If you don't like someone on Facebook,
[2:07:12.340 --> 2:07:16.180]  don't follow them. It's not that hard to figure out. Facebook, are you gonna do
[2:07:16.180 --> 2:07:20.380]  something about the liberals who call me the n-word? No, because big tech is only
[2:07:20.380 --> 2:07:24.460]  interested in going after conservatives. You know, the really dangerous ones.
[2:07:24.460 --> 2:07:28.260]  The dangerous has in saying things that Mark Zuckerberg doesn't like. President
[2:07:28.260 --> 2:07:32.140]  Trump retweeted Paul Joseph Watson twice and a brief video by Info Wars
[2:07:32.140 --> 2:07:36.980]  Millie Weaver, social media's homeowner Frank Stelter, was not very happy about it.
[2:07:36.980 --> 2:07:41.020]  He is promoting the same alternative universe as Info Wars. Back to your point
[2:07:41.020 --> 2:07:45.020]  though about the Info Wars presidency. I want to know and I tweeted this other day
[2:07:45.020 --> 2:07:48.740]  what is the difference right this point between Trump's Twitter feed and
[2:07:48.740 --> 2:07:55.060]  infowars.com. Info Wars content is useful to him. Info Wars personalities align with
[2:07:55.060 --> 2:07:58.820]  them. I want them shut down. I want them silenced. I want them muted. I think they
[2:07:58.820 --> 2:08:03.580]  are horrible for our society. I want them shut down. I want them silenced. I want
[2:08:03.580 --> 2:08:07.740]  them muted. Don't worry. These people aren't terrifying or anything.
[2:08:12.380 --> 2:08:16.380]  Info Wars, the most banned network in the world.
[2:08:18.940 --> 2:08:23.100]  And we are back live, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you so much for joining us on this
[2:08:23.100 --> 2:08:31.020]  Monday, November 4th, 2019, worldwide broadcast. And we've got a gentleman here
[2:08:31.020 --> 2:08:38.220]  in studio with us, Alan Keyes, that I've been watching on television at least
[2:08:38.220 --> 2:08:42.860]  since I was probably 10 years old back when he was in the Ronald Reagan
[2:08:42.860 --> 2:08:47.020]  administration as the ambassador from the U.S. to the U.N. appointed to the
[2:08:47.020 --> 2:08:51.300]  Economic and Social Council of the United States by President Reagan. And again,
[2:08:51.300 --> 2:08:55.260]  that's an inside area to really learn how the world really works. So I've always
[2:08:55.260 --> 2:08:59.020]  wanted to get Alan Keyes on. I know he's been on some of our other shows here on
[2:08:59.020 --> 2:09:01.820]  the Info Wars network and banned on video and some of our radio and TV
[2:09:01.820 --> 2:09:07.380]  affiliates, but I am TV dot U.S. Loyal to Liberty dot com. I'm going to go over his
[2:09:07.380 --> 2:09:11.540]  whole background or all the amazing things he's done. But back in the day of
[2:09:11.540 --> 2:09:15.140]  hosting Crossfire, all those other shows, he was a real conservative out there
[2:09:15.140 --> 2:09:18.620]  defending real values. And then over the years, they tried to disappear this guy,
[2:09:18.620 --> 2:09:21.700]  but he still pops up and still does a lot of great work. And I know you're doing
[2:09:21.700 --> 2:09:25.540]  a regular show again, which I'm a big fan of. So Alan Keyes, thanks for being
[2:09:25.540 --> 2:09:28.940]  here. Oh, great to be with you. Thank you. You bet. And this isn't like seeing
[2:09:28.940 --> 2:09:33.020]  in in the old days or MSNBC or seeing, you know, ABC, we don't know, pre
[2:09:33.020 --> 2:09:35.180]  interview folks and tell them what they can talk about. We just want to hear
[2:09:35.180 --> 2:09:38.580]  what you want to get into. And you say that obviously the big thing is this so
[2:09:38.580 --> 2:09:42.020]  called impeachment. Well, I think the impeachment farce is really important.
[2:09:42.020 --> 2:09:45.180]  And it's important that people in the United States understand what the real
[2:09:45.180 --> 2:09:50.220]  objective is. And I think you have been very good at getting folks to wake up
[2:09:50.220 --> 2:09:55.940]  to the truth. The object of all of this is not Donald Trump. He just happens to
[2:09:55.940 --> 2:10:02.180]  represent what they hate the most, which is the idea of government of buy and
[2:10:02.180 --> 2:10:07.500]  for the people. And I've never understood how it is that people let all of these
[2:10:07.500 --> 2:10:11.540]  folks who espouse socialism, communism, what they are pleased to call
[2:10:11.540 --> 2:10:15.940]  progressivism, even though it takes us back to the days when the few ruled
[2:10:15.940 --> 2:10:20.700]  over the many on the basis of the fact that we know what's right for you and
[2:10:20.700 --> 2:10:24.820]  you don't get to have a say in it. America was founded to stop that way of
[2:10:24.820 --> 2:10:30.620]  life, to get to a way of governing that would actually involve people in the key
[2:10:30.620 --> 2:10:35.500]  decisions that decide the destiny of their own society. And all socialism is
[2:10:35.500 --> 2:10:40.500]  actually based on what? I mean, the key premise of actual government for Karl
[2:10:40.500 --> 2:10:45.900]  Marx was dictatorship of one kind or another. The key premise of self
[2:10:45.900 --> 2:10:51.700]  government for the American founders was just that, that you stop dictatorship
[2:10:51.700 --> 2:10:56.340]  and allow the people to get involved in the discussions and informing
[2:10:56.340 --> 2:11:00.740]  themselves and then in coming to responsible decisions based on the
[2:11:00.740 --> 2:11:04.620]  premises of right that the country's founded on about what should happen. So
[2:11:04.620 --> 2:11:08.940]  dictatorship is no part of it. And I've never understood how folks can listen to
[2:11:08.940 --> 2:11:13.260]  these guys. Their ideology is all about dictatorship and then they swear to
[2:11:13.260 --> 2:11:17.540]  defend the Constitution. That's all about preventing dictatorship and we don't
[2:11:17.540 --> 2:11:22.180]  seem to get it. It's a contradiction. Well, you state that it just hits me
[2:11:22.180 --> 2:11:25.860]  like a thunderbolt because it's so true. It's so obvious and it's lost out there
[2:11:25.860 --> 2:11:30.580]  that communism and socialism is a ruling class dominating over people. Deciding
[2:11:30.580 --> 2:11:34.020]  who gets what it's right there in the manifesto. It's right there in Das
[2:11:34.020 --> 2:11:37.100]  Kapital that we're going to control production. We're going to control the
[2:11:37.100 --> 2:11:40.860]  family. China took hundreds of millions of people off the land. Tens of
[2:11:40.860 --> 2:11:44.660]  millions, you know, died. Some estimates are over, you know, 80 million just under
[2:11:44.660 --> 2:11:48.180]  Mao and then David Rockefeller, the richest guy on the earth at the time is
[2:11:48.180 --> 2:11:54.580]  in the New York Times in 1976 praising it. These are just mad men and then to
[2:11:54.580 --> 2:11:58.660]  try to resell it over and over again and to have this race by all these
[2:11:58.660 --> 2:12:02.820]  Democrats promising all this great free stuff they're going to give people is
[2:12:02.820 --> 2:12:09.300]  frightening. Well, and it's really all a lie. There is not a communist socialist
[2:12:09.300 --> 2:12:14.620]  regime in the world and there has not been one in the course of the history of
[2:12:14.620 --> 2:12:18.100]  the world since it started to become. That's right. They never meant that they
[2:12:18.100 --> 2:12:21.700]  never work. They never work and then people will what about Sweden and I
[2:12:21.700 --> 2:12:26.380]  say Sweden isn't a socialist country. Sweden is a country in which they
[2:12:26.380 --> 2:12:30.420]  essentially have allowed capitalism to continue to flourish and then they
[2:12:30.420 --> 2:12:35.500]  steal the results and put a facade. Exactly. It's a vampire bleeding 80% of
[2:12:35.500 --> 2:12:39.260]  the blood on. Exactly. Yeah. But if they didn't have the blood produced by the
[2:12:39.260 --> 2:12:43.780]  capitalist system, they wouldn't exist. So Sweden's just a really healthy blood
[2:12:43.780 --> 2:12:47.220]  donor. Exactly. How they stay healthy is anybody's
[2:12:47.220 --> 2:12:53.100]  is anybody's guess given what's going on there. But it's also going to be clear
[2:12:53.100 --> 2:12:57.820]  that question is coming for us. Right. How do you stay healthy when you put
[2:12:57.820 --> 2:13:03.100]  people in charge who are going to adopt policies that destroy the incentives and
[2:13:03.100 --> 2:13:07.380]  the foundational premises including the foundation of responsible liberty on
[2:13:07.380 --> 2:13:12.420]  which free enterprise actually depends on which the courage of individual
[2:13:12.420 --> 2:13:16.340]  innovating. In other case, I know you're the best spoken person I know on these
[2:13:16.340 --> 2:13:20.100]  subjects and I want to get into the fundamental problems. But why do most of
[2:13:20.100 --> 2:13:25.700]  the big ruling corporations and elites want this quasi socialist communist
[2:13:25.700 --> 2:13:30.380]  model that they bleed off of as crony capitalists? Why do they push for that
[2:13:30.380 --> 2:13:35.340]  almost all the billionaires are unified except a few pushing this idea?
[2:13:35.340 --> 2:13:40.260]  See, I think there are two reasons. One is because if you push for the ideas of
[2:13:40.260 --> 2:13:45.860]  socialism, you are admitting that all that matters is power. I find it quite
[2:13:45.860 --> 2:13:48.820]  intriguing that all these people who wear the socials label and pretend they're
[2:13:48.820 --> 2:13:53.300]  all for humanity. How can you believe people who tell you they're for humanity
[2:13:53.300 --> 2:13:59.660]  and then want to kill off humanity's prosperity in the womb? They're killers
[2:13:59.660 --> 2:14:05.100]  actually. Everything that they stand for now that's non-negotiable is about when
[2:14:05.100 --> 2:14:11.940]  you get to kill people. Have you thought that through? They're in fact, they pretend
[2:14:11.940 --> 2:14:15.300]  to be a progressive this and that and to be all about life and that more
[2:14:15.300 --> 2:14:19.380]  abundantly and in fact they're about death and how you can make sure you get
[2:14:19.380 --> 2:14:26.100]  to kill people in a more general way. And so if they can't do it openly through
[2:14:26.100 --> 2:14:30.300]  the kind of purges and mass murders that occurred in other places, then they're
[2:14:30.300 --> 2:14:34.540]  going to do it in subtle ways. But the most important thing they have to do
[2:14:34.540 --> 2:14:39.540]  is make sure that people no longer have the mechanism through elections and
[2:14:39.540 --> 2:14:42.380]  government to defend them. I'm getting chills. You're gonna have the floor when we
[2:14:42.380 --> 2:14:46.300]  come back. I literally just got chills because I told some of my friends of
[2:14:46.300 --> 2:14:49.740]  their talk show host. I go don't get mad when you hear somebody two, three years
[2:14:49.740 --> 2:14:53.100]  later writing exactly what you wrote or saying exactly what you said. They're not
[2:14:53.100 --> 2:14:57.220]  plagiarizing. They looked into it. They took it as their own. They believe it's
[2:14:57.220 --> 2:15:01.620]  theirs because it is them. That's real leadership. And I just remembered like
[2:15:01.620 --> 2:15:06.020]  25 years ago watching you in a debate or something on the actual television
[2:15:06.020 --> 2:15:10.500]  c-span. And you were saying they're about controlling life. They want
[2:15:10.500 --> 2:15:15.180]  death. They're control freaks. And it was the first time it crystallized for me in
[2:15:15.180 --> 2:15:19.780]  a modern context why a Stalin would do something or a Mao or Hitler when it
[2:15:19.780 --> 2:15:23.740]  made no sense and that it was a threat currently and then I have basically
[2:15:23.740 --> 2:15:28.260]  adopted that understanding which we now see is true and you've been a real
[2:15:28.260 --> 2:15:32.820]  trailblazer. So let's talk about how you went directly to the fact that it's a
[2:15:32.820 --> 2:15:36.860]  sacrament for them abortion and not just something that's birth control with
[2:15:36.860 --> 2:15:41.500]  former Reagan ambassador to the UN Alan Keyes. A guy the establishment is very
[2:15:41.500 --> 2:15:45.420]  afraid of and has been shadow betting for a long time. Everybody watching knows
[2:15:45.420 --> 2:15:51.500]  who he is or like Alan Keyes. Yeah, he's here with us. Stay with us.

[2:18:57.580 --> 2:19:02.220]  daughter came to me and she had her digital textbook. She said dad they're
[2:19:02.220 --> 2:19:06.380]  teaching us about the periodic table and I clicked on iodine and it says that 2
[2:19:06.380 --> 2:19:10.820]  billion people have low IQs or mentally retarded on the planet Earth because
[2:19:10.820 --> 2:19:14.220]  they didn't get enough iodine. That's what you say all the time but I've heard
[2:19:14.220 --> 2:19:17.660]  people say you're crazy and it's not true but dad it's right here on the
[2:19:17.660 --> 2:19:21.900]  periodic table when I click it saying exactly what you said and I said I know
[2:19:21.900 --> 2:19:24.820]  honey that's why I have you take a high quality
[2:19:24.820 --> 2:19:29.740]  pharmaceutical grade iodine is because it's why you're so vibrant it's why
[2:19:29.740 --> 2:19:34.700]  you're so alive it's it's one of the reasons that you're so much healthier
[2:19:34.700 --> 2:19:38.940]  and smarter than most other kids your age and it just really blew her away to
[2:19:38.940 --> 2:19:43.580]  read it there for herself and I know that two billion people ladies and
[2:19:43.580 --> 2:19:47.140]  gentlemen two billion are mentally retarded on the face of the earth right

[2:19:54.740 --> 2:20:20.740]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:20:20.740 --> 2:20:27.380]  Alright folks, Alan Keyes is our guest in studio and he got interrupted by the break and he was
[2:20:27.380 --> 2:20:32.180]  getting into this culture of death they want control over life and death they
[2:20:32.180 --> 2:20:35.900]  want control over when you're born when you die they want control over how many
[2:20:35.900 --> 2:20:39.300]  vitamins you can get they want control over where you can live but then these
[2:20:39.300 --> 2:20:43.060]  establishment types they have all their big private jets record private jet
[2:20:43.060 --> 2:20:45.660]  sales they're telling the general public we shouldn't be able to have
[2:20:45.660 --> 2:20:50.740]  airplane travels back to earth supposedly but they can live like kings but but
[2:20:50.740 --> 2:20:55.140]  really that's part of their world view their cosmology so get into that for us
[2:20:55.140 --> 2:20:58.500]  and well who these two forces are and then give me your view on where the
[2:20:58.500 --> 2:21:01.940]  world is currently today and what you expect to happen well I think they
[2:21:01.940 --> 2:21:07.620]  actually emphasize death because death is the way to call the herd to remove all
[2:21:07.620 --> 2:21:12.060]  the elements that are really gonna cause you problems everything they do is in
[2:21:12.060 --> 2:21:16.340]  fact about making sure that the American people cease to be ordinary that's a
[2:21:16.340 --> 2:21:20.140]  word that used to be in vogue right you're on you're an ornery character it
[2:21:20.140 --> 2:21:23.500]  means that you don't put up with a lot of garbage that you're willing to fight
[2:21:23.500 --> 2:21:27.060]  back for independent things that you believe to be right and that you have a
[2:21:27.060 --> 2:21:31.180]  strong sense of right and wrong that you're not going to give up what always
[2:21:31.180 --> 2:21:35.700]  intrigued me that you know the word ornery is actually a shortening and
[2:21:35.700 --> 2:21:47.340]  corruption of the word ordinary but the combination of ordinary and willing to
[2:21:47.340 --> 2:21:51.540]  take a strong stand in defense of your own viewpoint in defense of your own
[2:21:51.540 --> 2:21:56.740]  sense of right and wrong in defense of a sense that is strong in you because you
[2:21:56.740 --> 2:22:00.540]  don't just base it on your own will you're actually basing it on your sense
[2:22:00.540 --> 2:22:04.460]  of the will of God so that something beyond yourself something's coming through
[2:22:04.460 --> 2:22:08.820]  with a sense of confidence and it comes through in you this has proven to be the
[2:22:08.820 --> 2:22:12.340]  great strength of the American people and they hate it and I think at the end
[2:22:12.340 --> 2:22:16.820]  of the day they're preparing us with this death cult stuff so that they will be
[2:22:16.820 --> 2:22:21.500]  able to get away with purges here like at the purges that were necessary in
[2:22:21.500 --> 2:22:26.060]  order for communism and socialism to get established and stay established wow
[2:22:26.060 --> 2:22:31.100]  and whether men Obama's mentors and Hillary's shed all that and have a plan
[2:22:31.100 --> 2:22:35.900]  for that oh I think they have a plan and when Donald Trump came along the thing
[2:22:35.900 --> 2:22:41.180]  he represents most is the fact that the people actually didn't do what they were
[2:22:41.180 --> 2:22:45.620]  supposed to do you remember years ago Nancy Pelosi in the midst of the Tea
[2:22:45.620 --> 2:22:49.260]  Party uprising and all of this was chiding the Republicans as if they
[2:22:49.260 --> 2:22:53.380]  weren't doing their job and she concluded that by saying that they you know
[2:22:53.380 --> 2:22:55.900]  your party's getting out of control your people are getting out of control
[2:22:55.900 --> 2:23:00.900]  elections elections shouldn't matter so much can you imagine somebody saying that
[2:23:00.900 --> 2:23:05.540]  in the United States I got that clip if you say elections shouldn't matter so
[2:23:05.540 --> 2:23:09.900]  much you're saying the vote of the people the choice of the people the will
[2:23:09.900 --> 2:23:13.020]  of the people the judgment of the people shouldn't matter and that's really
[2:23:13.020 --> 2:23:16.740]  what Russiagate is is saying we didn't elect Trump when of course it's not
[2:23:16.740 --> 2:23:22.220]  true and and so she regards the election of Trump and they all do as a slap in
[2:23:22.220 --> 2:23:28.260]  the face to their plan to impose elitist control on the people of the
[2:23:28.260 --> 2:23:31.660]  United States you can pull that up for next segment it'll be on YouTube still
[2:23:31.660 --> 2:23:36.300]  Nancy Pelosi election shouldn't matter so much I forget the whoppers they say
[2:23:36.300 --> 2:23:39.900]  all the time and they mean it yeah oh they not only mean it they're enforcing
[2:23:39.900 --> 2:23:44.380]  it now because the whole impeachment force is about trying to get things
[2:23:44.380 --> 2:23:48.460]  arranged so that the elitist faction types in the Democrat Party can join
[2:23:48.460 --> 2:23:52.900]  with the elitist faction types in the Republican Party to remove the stain
[2:23:52.900 --> 2:23:57.540]  of an election that actually proved that the people of the United States can
[2:23:57.540 --> 2:24:01.020]  get that's right and the times of the London and the financial times and all
[2:24:01.020 --> 2:24:05.860]  these elitist publications say populism and nationalism is exploding and free
[2:24:05.860 --> 2:24:10.340]  market we've got to defeat Trump to discredit it worldwide this is a global
[2:24:10.340 --> 2:24:15.580]  fight oh it's a global fight and it's a fight that I think the people have to
[2:24:15.580 --> 2:24:20.540]  win well I encounter a lot of people who know it so far by the way I think
[2:24:20.540 --> 2:24:25.900]  they've been utterly incapable of making this whole impeachment farce work
[2:24:25.900 --> 2:24:30.740]  it's hurting the Democrats more than it's hurting anybody else and I thank God
[2:24:30.740 --> 2:24:36.260]  for it and I think that as long as they continue to pursue it when they cannot
[2:24:36.260 --> 2:24:40.620]  come up with any valid grounds the thing that's been proven most in this whole
[2:24:40.620 --> 2:24:45.220]  impeachment farce is that Joe Biden should be impeached now people say
[2:24:45.220 --> 2:24:48.380]  Alan he's out of office already and I'm impeached with about removing people
[2:24:48.380 --> 2:24:52.540]  want no it's not people forget that in the Constitution and Hamilton talks
[2:24:52.540 --> 2:24:57.860]  about this in the Federalist Papers there are two things that result from
[2:24:57.860 --> 2:25:02.980]  conviction once you've been accused because accusement impeachment is the
[2:25:02.980 --> 2:25:06.980]  accusation once you've been convicted you are removed from office and you can
[2:25:06.980 --> 2:25:12.380]  be barred from holding any office of trust or profit under the United States
[2:25:12.380 --> 2:25:16.020]  after that right so you couldn't run for president you couldn't do what some of
[2:25:16.020 --> 2:25:18.700]  these people do after they've committed their try that's right they could be
[2:25:18.700 --> 2:25:22.380]  having hearings on the candidate but I hope people have noticed that what they
[2:25:22.380 --> 2:25:27.420]  accuse Trump of doing which is abusing your power to promote your own selfish
[2:25:27.420 --> 2:25:31.740]  interest right and they say it's a political interest why is it a
[2:25:31.740 --> 2:25:36.900]  political interest for the chief law enforcement officer who is sworn to see
[2:25:36.900 --> 2:25:41.860]  to it that the laws be faithfully executed is talking to a foreign ruler
[2:25:41.860 --> 2:25:46.620]  and says you know we have got some indications that maybe so-and-so was
[2:25:46.620 --> 2:25:50.820]  involved in doing something that's unlawful and would you really make sure
[2:25:50.820 --> 2:25:54.700]  it's investigated because it involved a corporation here in the Ukraine and so
[2:25:54.700 --> 2:25:58.860]  forth and so on how was that anything other than the president's job he's
[2:25:58.860 --> 2:26:02.380]  doing his job y'all and the Ukrainian president bringing up the
[2:26:02.380 --> 2:26:06.580]  corruption to him well and the idea that because somebody who's you're a
[2:26:06.580 --> 2:26:10.780]  potential political opponent or whatever is involved you should not enforce the
[2:26:10.780 --> 2:26:14.420]  law is ludicrous well exactly what do you call that is it a double negative what
[2:26:14.420 --> 2:26:18.180]  is it when they're committing the crime and they say investigating the crime
[2:26:18.180 --> 2:26:22.300]  that's cut and dry biden saying it out of everybody that that's the crime and
[2:26:22.300 --> 2:26:26.740]  they also try to act as if you do it on a partisan basis and so forth and so you
[2:26:26.740 --> 2:26:30.980]  can't go after your political opponents they apparently have never read the
[2:26:30.980 --> 2:26:34.100]  Constitution because the Constitution actually doesn't recognize the
[2:26:34.100 --> 2:26:37.980]  existence of parties individuals who serve in the government serve as
[2:26:37.980 --> 2:26:42.860]  individuals sworn to uphold the Constitution of the United States and
[2:26:42.860 --> 2:26:46.380]  that's why our first president George Washington hated parties yes he hated
[2:26:46.380 --> 2:26:51.260]  them and he called them what I think our parties have become they were
[2:26:51.260 --> 2:26:56.420]  factions which means combinations of individuals acting in their own selfish
[2:26:56.420 --> 2:27:00.780]  interest and against the interest of the common good of the body politics I
[2:27:00.780 --> 2:27:05.180]  think that has become the definition of politics certainly for most of the
[2:27:05.180 --> 2:27:09.300]  Democrat politicians and for a lot of the Republicans as well this is what
[2:27:09.300 --> 2:27:13.500]  they're about they don't think about what's good for the people as a whole
[2:27:13.500 --> 2:27:17.260]  what's good for the nation as a whole because if they did their first
[2:27:17.260 --> 2:27:22.380]  prerequisite would be to preserve the common ground of our understanding of
[2:27:22.380 --> 2:27:26.700]  right and wrong justice and injustice articulated in the declaration and put
[2:27:26.700 --> 2:27:31.500]  into effect and that's why the left is such war with reality because common
[2:27:31.500 --> 2:27:35.540]  citizen reality brings order they want disorder to have control yeah and so
[2:27:35.540 --> 2:27:39.700]  they're at war with reality they're at war with reality because they want the
[2:27:39.700 --> 2:27:45.180]  power to impose a reality entirely defined by them and you'll notice that
[2:27:45.180 --> 2:27:50.140]  everywhere the socialist communists achieve that objective the reality is a
[2:27:50.140 --> 2:27:56.540]  reality of wealth and power for the few who follow the party line and dismal
[2:27:56.540 --> 2:28:01.660]  servitude for everybody else and those who didn't even just get in first
[2:28:01.660 --> 2:28:04.100]  because usually there's a big power struggle once the communists get
[2:28:04.100 --> 2:28:08.140]  control then they purge amongst their own people and then it's purge purge purge
[2:28:08.140 --> 2:28:12.740]  so it's also even very dangerous because there's no checks and balances to be in
[2:28:12.740 --> 2:28:16.580]  the leadership and then even the top leaders are being deposed and killed
[2:28:16.580 --> 2:28:20.140]  it's a nightmare and you know one of the greatest obstacles to all of this in
[2:28:20.140 --> 2:28:24.900]  the American legal system is the presumption of innocence if you have to
[2:28:24.900 --> 2:28:29.820]  be presumed innocent then the burden of proof is on those who are accusing you
[2:28:29.820 --> 2:28:33.100]  and the present now Adam Schiff's throwing that out the window we got to come
[2:28:33.100 --> 2:28:36.820]  back let's come back with Dr. Allen keys with us right now he's on fire he's

[2:33:14.300 --> 2:33:21.460]  crashing through the lies and disinformation it's Alex Jones you know
[2:33:21.460 --> 2:33:25.900]  Alan Keyes is here and the whole office is like man this guy is awesome that he
[2:33:25.900 --> 2:33:29.740]  is awesome and he's not censored here is you'd hear what he's actually saying it
[2:33:29.740 --> 2:33:33.060]  all makes perfect sense especially when you find out he's been saying it for
[2:33:33.060 --> 2:33:36.620]  decades and doctoral graduate of Harvard worked in the diplomatic corps all over
[2:33:36.620 --> 2:33:40.900]  the world got appointed to head up on the main operations for Reagan and then
[2:33:40.900 --> 2:33:43.300]  served as Reagan's assistant secretary of state for international
[2:33:43.300 --> 2:33:47.700]  organization affairs I'm not going to go over all of it but as capacities as UN
[2:33:47.700 --> 2:33:52.420]  ambassador among keys accomplishments was contributing to Mexico City policy and a
[2:33:52.420 --> 2:33:59.540]  lot more and of course he's a famous pro lifer I am TV dot US I am TV dot US find
[2:33:59.540 --> 2:34:05.060]  his show the audiobooks and everything right there on that site you got caught
[2:34:05.060 --> 2:34:08.140]  off by the break that you were mentioning Pelosi and people probably think
[2:34:08.140 --> 2:34:12.380]  oh elections don't matter elections matter too much they're making that up no
[2:34:12.380 --> 2:34:41.700]  she really said it here it is that's our speaking to donors not knowing she's
[2:34:41.700 --> 2:34:44.940]  getting video you know the thing that I find appalling about this these people
[2:34:44.940 --> 2:34:50.220]  talk about differences of opinion and the last thing they tolerate is a
[2:34:50.220 --> 2:34:53.500]  difference of opinion that's why they hate Donald Trump so much because it
[2:34:53.500 --> 2:34:58.100]  can't always one of the views that were against theirs and they hate him to death
[2:34:58.100 --> 2:35:01.540]  literally they want to get rid of him with impeachment and everything else and
[2:35:01.540 --> 2:35:06.340]  I think that this is the main reason for it because he was actually supposed to
[2:35:06.340 --> 2:35:11.100]  be somebody they thought of as their guy and like them and so forth and suddenly
[2:35:11.100 --> 2:35:14.820]  he's hearkening to the voice of the American people he's hearkening to the
[2:35:14.820 --> 2:35:19.900]  common sense that he himself had had to apply in the course of his life and
[2:35:19.900 --> 2:35:24.380]  career and finally he's suddenly sensitive to the thing they hate the most
[2:35:24.380 --> 2:35:27.620]  you know what they hate the most they hate Americans who still believe in God
[2:35:27.620 --> 2:35:32.060]  who still remember that our claim to self-government is based on God in doubt
[2:35:32.060 --> 2:35:36.580]  on alienable rights not things we make up out of whole cloth and therefore
[2:35:36.580 --> 2:35:41.340]  there's a power transcendent to the power of money and parties and ideology
[2:35:41.340 --> 2:35:47.940]  that protects individuals in their right to take a stand for justice when they
[2:35:47.940 --> 2:35:51.700]  are being maltreated and it's what has given Americans the courage to do so
[2:35:51.700 --> 2:35:56.680]  time after time in area after area and if we had not been founded on those
[2:35:56.680 --> 2:36:01.780]  premises not a single battle against slavery for civil rights for human rights
[2:36:01.780 --> 2:36:05.260]  for women's rights none of it would have said is that a moral courage or is it
[2:36:05.260 --> 2:36:09.820]  more of a moral directive I think it's a directive that then leads to courage
[2:36:09.820 --> 2:36:13.020]  because after all one of the things I often try to get people to see is that
[2:36:13.020 --> 2:36:19.220]  the word right is not simply synonymous with freedom every right involves
[2:36:19.220 --> 2:36:23.940]  freedom but not every freedom is an exercise of right because it implies
[2:36:23.940 --> 2:36:27.860]  that you're doing what's right so the people who come together and came
[2:36:27.860 --> 2:36:31.380]  together to form the United States for all their faults they expressed
[2:36:31.380 --> 2:36:36.660]  themselves as a committed to a goal for government that was to secure right
[2:36:36.660 --> 2:36:42.060]  doing by it was the idea that was transcendent it was the idea yes and
[2:36:42.060 --> 2:36:45.780]  now the left what do you how do you quantify this how they create new
[2:36:45.780 --> 2:36:49.620]  rights we have a right for access to your children here awesome just passed it
[2:36:49.620 --> 2:36:53.220]  last week to sexualize eight-year-olds and teach them about things I won't say
[2:36:53.220 --> 2:36:57.060]  on adult radio or Canada is gonna ask four-year-olds when they go to preschool
[2:36:57.060 --> 2:37:02.140]  by law what their sexual preference is so so now that the abuse of children
[2:37:02.140 --> 2:37:06.420]  they're claiming is a right or Travis County where I live where I guess
[2:37:06.420 --> 2:37:09.340]  sometimes gotta leave I came and afford to move the offices or I would we have
[2:37:09.340 --> 2:37:14.140]  to pay for people's abortions here how was my having to pay for somebody to
[2:37:14.140 --> 2:37:18.480]  kill their child a right so what is this perversion of rights where the left
[2:37:18.480 --> 2:37:24.780]  ignores all of the basic rights that are transcendent and unable that stand on
[2:37:24.780 --> 2:37:29.100]  their own and then they invent these these these twisted things well I think
[2:37:29.100 --> 2:37:33.060]  first of all what it involves it is discarding the concept of right there
[2:37:33.060 --> 2:37:37.500]  is no right or wrong except what serves their party line what serves to get them
[2:37:37.500 --> 2:37:41.700]  into power and to keep them in power and then to allow them to pursue their
[2:37:41.700 --> 2:37:46.740]  agenda but what that means is that there is no distinction between children and
[2:37:46.740 --> 2:37:51.860]  grown-ups in the effective sense that they can go in and they think exploit
[2:37:51.860 --> 2:37:57.500]  children just as they want to exploit grown-ups because imagine it is a child
[2:37:57.500 --> 2:38:02.900]  deprived of a real understanding of what's involved making a choice when
[2:38:02.900 --> 2:38:06.860]  they make a gender choice I have no idea what you're talking about to tell you
[2:38:06.860 --> 2:38:12.540]  the truth that means that for these people deception becomes the basis for
[2:38:12.540 --> 2:38:16.540]  choice you and I both know that if you do something based on deception you've
[2:38:16.540 --> 2:38:19.940]  actually been coerced you can tell a five-year-old their Batman and they'll
[2:38:19.940 --> 2:38:23.900]  they'll say it okay well let's put bat wings on you that's not an exercise of
[2:38:23.900 --> 2:38:29.020]  freedom but once you call it freedom the freedom to be this gender and that
[2:38:29.020 --> 2:38:32.380]  gender even though you didn't have the information necessary to make that
[2:38:32.380 --> 2:38:37.620]  choice then you can argue that their limitation of information produces a
[2:38:37.620 --> 2:38:41.780]  free choice that's the only way socialists and communists can actually
[2:38:41.780 --> 2:38:45.940]  pretend to have free choices you're making a free choice because you made it
[2:38:45.940 --> 2:38:49.460]  based on the information and lies we told you example you're a conservative
[2:38:49.460 --> 2:38:53.500]  Christian you're on fire you're super smart you could talk for 10 hours none of
[2:38:53.500 --> 2:38:57.620]  it's boring none of it's made up I go to let this event so they act like zombies
[2:38:57.620 --> 2:39:00.820]  they're acting weirder and weirder they act like they have had their soul sucked
[2:39:00.820 --> 2:39:06.180]  out and they really have a craving to do bad and it seems like it's getting
[2:39:06.180 --> 2:39:10.380]  worse and it's manifesting more and everything I read in the Bible that I
[2:39:10.380 --> 2:39:14.260]  was a kid think oh this would never happen it's now happening well I think
[2:39:14.260 --> 2:39:18.140]  that that's what happens when you disregard the standard of right and its
[2:39:18.140 --> 2:39:22.940]  consequences the standard of right in America was God in doubt an alienable
[2:39:22.940 --> 2:39:26.900]  right the first appeal made in the Declaration of Independence was not to
[2:39:26.900 --> 2:39:31.460]  power to God it wasn't even to injustice it was to God and the laws of
[2:39:31.460 --> 2:39:36.580]  nature and of nature's God God and his rules in other words so the idea that
[2:39:36.580 --> 2:39:39.620]  somehow or anyone they were gonna divorce something they had to talk to the
[2:39:39.620 --> 2:39:44.260]  boss first that's right and but they also knew that the boss was the one that
[2:39:44.260 --> 2:39:49.060]  freed them you exist as what you are cuz God made you that way you wouldn't be
[2:39:49.060 --> 2:39:53.380]  free to exist as what you are we recognize God gives us a choice whether
[2:39:53.380 --> 2:39:58.980]  we want to be free or slaves that's right and he gave us that choice for two
[2:39:58.980 --> 2:40:05.300]  reasons I think one so that we would be responsible for ourselves and second so
[2:40:05.300 --> 2:40:10.340]  that when we made the right choices we would be responsible for those choices
[2:40:10.340 --> 2:40:15.540]  and therefore capable of doing what sometimes I think we forget cuz these
[2:40:15.540 --> 2:40:19.620]  days people talk a lot about love do you think that somebody loves you if
[2:40:19.620 --> 2:40:22.380]  they're saying they love you cuz there's a gun at their head and they have to
[2:40:22.380 --> 2:40:27.540]  nobody believes in that the only love we believe in is the love that results
[2:40:27.540 --> 2:40:33.100]  from a truly free choice and so God made us to have that choice so we could
[2:40:33.100 --> 2:40:39.740]  experience love show love and be proven to love both him and those around us
[2:40:39.740 --> 2:40:45.540]  and so the juxtaposition of love is actually about accepting responsibility
[2:40:45.540 --> 2:40:51.620]  for the choices God allows us to make in light of the rules that are built into
[2:40:51.620 --> 2:40:55.500]  us on alienable means that exactly so people that are at war with the basic
[2:40:55.500 --> 2:40:59.540]  rules and programming that God gave us and decide to violate that they always
[2:40:59.540 --> 2:41:02.460]  just get more degenerate because that's the only direction they can go well I
[2:41:02.460 --> 2:41:05.460]  think so because at the end of the day they're not guided by anything they
[2:41:05.460 --> 2:41:09.660]  don't accept the limits that allow things to exist in their different spheres
[2:41:09.660 --> 2:41:14.020]  and in their different ways and they also don't accept the unity that comes
[2:41:14.020 --> 2:41:18.900]  from the fact that we are all grounded in the same being you know in the Bible
[2:41:18.900 --> 2:41:22.420]  it says in him we live and move and have our being which means they're at
[2:41:22.420 --> 2:41:25.540]  rebellion against that but when you get into evil it's totally horrible and
[2:41:25.540 --> 2:41:29.780]  depressing I just don't but I just don't understand it but they do choose
[2:41:29.780 --> 2:41:33.460]  that to be destroyed I mean they just they do it well they do because at the
[2:41:33.460 --> 2:41:38.660]  end of the day if you reject the source of your existence the only viable
[2:41:38.660 --> 2:41:43.500]  alternative for you is to destroy things rather than build them and isn't it
[2:41:43.500 --> 2:41:46.980]  interesting that all these people who talk about how much they're going to do
[2:41:46.980 --> 2:41:50.020]  for folks and how much they're going to do for the people look at the places they
[2:41:50.020 --> 2:41:54.020]  rule whether it's California now whether it's a lot of the urban areas in the
[2:41:54.020 --> 2:41:57.660]  United States you follow their understanding of all that you should be
[2:41:57.660 --> 2:42:02.380]  doing for people and you get cesspools and you get cities to show increases in
[2:42:02.380 --> 2:42:05.740]  poverty and crime and everything else left us for the most greedy people they
[2:42:05.740 --> 2:42:09.780]  don't give the charity they lie constantly and I think it's the reason is
[2:42:09.780 --> 2:42:13.460]  that if you remove all sense of constraint you remove all sense of
[2:42:13.460 --> 2:42:17.980]  responsibility only one thing matters to these folks the outcome and if outcomes
[2:42:17.980 --> 2:42:23.180]  are all that matter then the only thing that's really to distinguish people in
[2:42:23.180 --> 2:42:27.020]  terms of government and rule is how much power you have power becomes the
[2:42:27.020 --> 2:42:32.980]  central obsession and getting it by any means lying cheating killing stealing
[2:42:32.980 --> 2:42:37.900]  that becomes acceptable and that has been the rule among the socialist idea
[2:42:37.900 --> 2:42:40.980]  law I'm gonna play this clip of shift and get into the actual impeachment where
[2:42:40.980 --> 2:42:44.460]  you think it's going your prediction 2020 coming up Alan Key seems like the
[2:42:44.460 --> 2:42:50.700]  last 45 minutes was 10 seconds wow ha ha we'll be right back
[2:42:51.700 --> 2:42:58.300]  the Alex Jones show a few days ago my 11 year old daughter came to me and she
[2:42:58.300 --> 2:43:02.460]  had her digital textbook she said dad they're teaching us about the periodic
[2:43:02.460 --> 2:43:06.700]  table and I clicked on iodine and it says that two billion people have low
[2:43:06.700 --> 2:43:10.380]  IQs are mentally retarded on the planet Earth because they didn't get enough
[2:43:10.380 --> 2:43:14.300]  iodine that's what you say all the time but I've heard people say you're crazy
[2:43:14.300 --> 2:43:18.300]  and it's not true but dad it's right here on the periodic table when I click
[2:43:18.300 --> 2:43:22.660]  it saying exactly what you said and I said I know honey that's why I have you
[2:43:22.660 --> 2:43:28.140]  take a high-quality nutraceutical grade iodine is because it's why you're so
[2:43:28.140 --> 2:43:33.260]  vibrant it's why you're so alive it's it's one of the reasons that you're so
[2:43:33.260 --> 2:43:37.140]  much healthier and smarter than most of the kids your age and it just really blew
[2:43:37.140 --> 2:43:42.700]  her away to read it there for herself that other two billion people ladies and
[2:43:42.700 --> 2:43:46.260]  gentlemen two billion are mentally retarded on the face of the earth right
[2:43:46.260 --> 2:43:49.660]  now because of iodine deficiency research it and find out for yourself and
[2:43:49.660 --> 2:43:55.420]  now info wars.com we have strong disagreement on policy grounds and hope
[2:43:55.420 --> 2:43:59.260]  there's diversity in policy here I don't care what your views are I hope you
[2:43:59.260 --> 2:44:02.420]  articulate them and defend them and listen and debate them that's important
[2:44:02.420 --> 2:44:06.100]  but we have something in common we have a set of values that are at the core of
[2:44:06.100 --> 2:44:10.140]  this country that hold this place together. Clinton deep state bag man
[2:44:10.140 --> 2:44:14.580]  Comey thinks it's funny that he was the leaker and that he lied to Congress in
[2:44:14.580 --> 2:44:18.420]  the world he thinks committing crimes are funny and he thinks if he acts
[2:44:18.420 --> 2:44:23.300]  confident he won't get indicted but word is the criminal investigation is
[2:44:23.300 --> 2:44:29.540]  honing in on him. From my new home in New Zealand I will
[2:44:29.540 --> 2:44:34.780]  oh and now suddenly he's talking about moving to New Zealand not so fast
[2:44:34.780 --> 2:44:38.220]  criminal we're going to bring you to justice and we're going to bring
[2:44:38.220 --> 2:44:43.020]  Hillary to justice as well because if we don't you criminals will continue to
[2:44:43.020 --> 2:44:46.540]  strike back at your enemy but the American people know how much you hate
[2:44:46.540 --> 2:44:51.460]  us and we're fighting back at info wars.com news wars.com and band off
[2:44:51.460 --> 2:44:59.620]  video. The time has come to defy the thought police. They are banding hundreds
[2:44:59.620 --> 2:45:03.740]  and hundreds of symbols every year they're waging war on communication
[2:45:03.740 --> 2:45:08.820]  itself as the Fabian socialists promised they would do more than 70 years ago
[2:45:08.820 --> 2:45:13.660]  from their command base in England. We've had Oxford come out and banned
[2:45:13.660 --> 2:45:18.380]  clapping the ADL and others will literally bankrupt you kick you out of

[2:46:54.700 --> 2:47:15.660]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show well Alan Teese is here and I've been watching him since I was in grade school and
[2:47:15.660 --> 2:47:19.700]  loving his work and then the learned the break that he visits info wars.com daily
[2:47:19.700 --> 2:47:24.540]  that's amazing great and he's hosting a new TV show as well very exciting I am
[2:47:24.540 --> 2:47:29.300]  tv.us lowdoliberty.com he says he'll come back routinely we're very excited he's
[2:47:29.300 --> 2:47:33.300]  gonna visit Mike Adams and his TV studio and do some work with him as well and
[2:47:33.300 --> 2:47:36.180]  then I guess it's back to Maryland and back to Tennessee where he lives in both
[2:47:36.180 --> 2:47:40.260]  places works in Tennessee lives in Maryland but I don't say this to be
[2:47:40.260 --> 2:47:43.900]  obnoxious or say it's a bad thing when I that conversation with Trump some of
[2:47:43.900 --> 2:47:49.540]  them like 10 minutes long he can finish my sentences exactly as I was thinking
[2:47:49.540 --> 2:47:52.020]  he doesn't really do that in public you can't I don't say he dumps it down but
[2:47:52.020 --> 2:47:56.020]  he you know he makes a little bit simpler just for everybody but but when
[2:47:56.020 --> 2:47:58.700]  you're finishing my sentences it's amazing because I'm asking the questions
[2:47:58.700 --> 2:48:02.260]  like when we come back I want to get into why is it the left doesn't have any
[2:48:02.260 --> 2:48:06.660]  rules anymore cheats on everything has fake whistleblowers won't have due
[2:48:06.660 --> 2:48:10.060]  process says they'll send the questions the Republicans won't tell them who they
[2:48:10.060 --> 2:48:13.140]  are but expects they're gonna remove the president and then you're kind of
[2:48:13.140 --> 2:48:17.980]  finishing my question you know right there and just boiling it down because I
[2:48:17.980 --> 2:48:21.220]  was saying why are they getting away with it you said they're not getting away
[2:48:21.220 --> 2:48:24.900]  with it well I don't think they are I think Americans still have a modicum of
[2:48:24.900 --> 2:48:28.620]  common sense that is superior to that which you might expect and certainly
[2:48:28.620 --> 2:48:31.940]  superior to what they think we have and I think they're building up a lot of
[2:48:31.940 --> 2:48:36.900]  resentment and the resentment isn't necessarily just on issues they dislike
[2:48:36.900 --> 2:48:42.820]  and so forth what's been coming across in their debates and in their approaches
[2:48:42.820 --> 2:48:47.540]  to policy and especially in the way they have abused the choice the American
[2:48:47.540 --> 2:48:52.160]  people made in 2016 is their hatred of America these people don't like this
[2:48:52.160 --> 2:48:57.660]  country they really hate it they hate America they absolutely ignore and lie
[2:48:57.660 --> 2:49:02.540]  about the fact that we have been fighting for justice in this country and
[2:49:02.540 --> 2:49:07.860]  that in point of fact every time the American people as a whole confronted a
[2:49:07.860 --> 2:49:11.900]  crisis where things came to a head whether it's about slavery women's
[2:49:11.900 --> 2:49:16.500]  rights the civil rights movement and so forth and so on the decision we took
[2:49:16.500 --> 2:49:22.100]  was the right decision you don't get to pretend these things are all oh we have
[2:49:22.100 --> 2:49:25.580]  there's races in the country racist nothing good has ever happened and we're
[2:49:25.580 --> 2:49:29.460]  gonna make it happen that's a lie good to be there really stealing credit for
[2:49:29.460 --> 2:49:33.100]  people like Martin Luther King exactly they're stealing credit from everybody
[2:49:33.100 --> 2:49:36.340]  who fought in our wars they're stealing credit from take a lot of them are in
[2:49:36.340 --> 2:49:39.540]  fact you this up and then we'll go to the fake shift thing I know that's all
[2:49:39.540 --> 2:49:42.820]  news but it's important to play again like the Pelosi clip Ilhan Omar cue her
[2:49:42.820 --> 2:49:46.660]  up please she says Bernie Sanders will be a president who will fight against
[2:49:46.660 --> 2:49:50.380]  Western imperialism and I'm not saying imperialism has it done some bad things
[2:49:50.380 --> 2:49:55.620]  I don't defend it but the idea that that she's trying to get into America but
[2:49:55.620 --> 2:49:59.700]  she's gonna tell us how bad it is and then and then she and she projects
[2:49:59.700 --> 2:50:04.540]  imperialism onto it well to project imperialism on the United States when
[2:50:04.540 --> 2:50:09.460]  at the if we had been an imperial power at the end of World War two we had what
[2:50:09.460 --> 2:50:14.100]  Napoleon only dreamt about he said at one point if I had Thunderbolts I'd use
[2:50:14.100 --> 2:50:17.920]  Thunderbolts right well nuclear weapons were the equivalent of Thunderbolts they
[2:50:17.920 --> 2:50:21.580]  were something that you launched from a distance and you could wipe out whole
[2:50:21.580 --> 2:50:25.660]  cities and nobody else had it and nobody else had it we were what the last man
[2:50:25.660 --> 2:50:29.740]  standing everybody else's economy in the world practically was crashed to the
[2:50:29.740 --> 2:50:34.420]  ground and so forth and so on when you look in at the aftermath of that we not
[2:50:34.420 --> 2:50:40.420]  only helped to rebuild countries even our enemies we also insisted on an end to
[2:50:40.420 --> 2:50:44.940]  imperialism in many parts of the world and and encourage the French the British
[2:50:44.940 --> 2:50:48.340]  and others and they're setting up their globalist corporate leftist
[2:50:48.340 --> 2:50:51.780]  Imperium with the chai comms and they're threatened by the American idea that
[2:50:51.780 --> 2:50:57.100]  opposes their imperialism that's right China is now the most active imperialistic
[2:50:57.100 --> 2:51:01.540]  power on earth and they are entering into various things as part of their
[2:51:01.540 --> 2:51:06.420]  Belt and Road initiative and all this stuff to create unequal relations with
[2:51:06.420 --> 2:51:11.260]  countries so that they can dominate them economically put that imperial
[2:51:11.260 --> 2:51:14.940]  relationship a classic imperial relationship and the fact that they
[2:51:14.940 --> 2:51:19.100]  claim they're doing it so that I don't know socialism and communism can be
[2:51:19.100 --> 2:51:23.140]  spread yeah so that everybody can live in the kind of fear they are now
[2:51:23.140 --> 2:51:27.980]  imposing on the people of Hong Kong and the very same people like to talk all
[2:51:27.980 --> 2:51:30.940]  of the world you have to be free to be yourself and do this and have that
[2:51:30.940 --> 2:51:34.420]  expression and that expression whether it's sexual or otherwise they're
[2:51:34.420 --> 2:51:39.220]  watching this spectacle and because they're so in love with the socialist
[2:51:39.220 --> 2:51:45.740]  communist idea they have no courage whatsoever in opposing the imposition of
[2:51:45.740 --> 2:51:50.740]  that imperialism well exactly modern leftist act like all the degeneracy and
[2:51:50.740 --> 2:51:54.700]  ugliness of the satanic left is what made the west grade when it was
[2:51:54.700 --> 2:52:00.300]  Christianity and the Renaissance and that real ethos that that that threatens
[2:52:00.300 --> 2:52:04.020]  who they are the left are the authoritarians they are the control freaks
[2:52:04.020 --> 2:52:08.380]  they are the censors they are the liars and then they stare at us and say
[2:52:08.380 --> 2:52:13.420]  we're the bad guys it's preposterous but our acquiescence and bowling to them has
[2:52:13.420 --> 2:52:17.060]  only invited this behavior well I think that that's very true in our
[2:52:17.060 --> 2:52:21.420]  international relations but I also think it's true in the way in which Americans
[2:52:21.420 --> 2:52:26.780]  have been willing to let this drivel go unchallenged and in some ways we've been
[2:52:26.780 --> 2:52:33.020]  so absorbed in the discussion of their agenda for evil that we have forgotten
[2:52:33.020 --> 2:52:37.820]  that we as a people stand on a common ground that is an agenda for good an
[2:52:37.820 --> 2:52:42.020]  agenda for right and justice and that's my question because I talk about my wife
[2:52:42.020 --> 2:52:47.020]  all the time having to focus on the left and all the evil things they do and the
[2:52:47.020 --> 2:52:50.180]  spectacles they engage in just to rub it in our faces almost becomes like a form
[2:52:50.180 --> 2:52:54.020]  of worship when I spend all my time on what they're doing versus what we've
[2:52:54.020 --> 2:52:57.500]  done and what we've built and what we would do how do you balance it though
[2:52:57.500 --> 2:53:00.620]  like wring the alarm on what they're doing and point out they're bad but
[2:53:00.620 --> 2:53:04.100]  also spend most of our time building and leading people and doing good things
[2:53:04.100 --> 2:53:08.300]  separate from them to show the superiority of the Christian system well I
[2:53:08.300 --> 2:53:11.780]  actually think you do a pretty good job at that most of the time because the
[2:53:11.780 --> 2:53:17.140]  first thing that has to be emphasized is that our understanding leaves people in
[2:53:17.140 --> 2:53:21.180]  the position of being responsible for their choices right and when you're
[2:53:21.180 --> 2:53:24.740]  responsible for your choices you have to take responsibility that's a challenge
[2:53:24.740 --> 2:53:28.340]  and it's a challenge that starts with the way we conduct our family life our
[2:53:28.340 --> 2:53:33.060]  economic life and everything else they're constantly trying to pretend that
[2:53:33.060 --> 2:53:38.420]  this country should be about what is being done for us you are constantly
[2:53:38.420 --> 2:53:42.940]  reminding people that this country was built by folks who understood that you
[2:53:42.940 --> 2:53:48.220]  must meet the challenge of doing things for yourself and in the process you do
[2:53:48.220 --> 2:53:52.420]  things for your family your community and ultimately build the kind of country
[2:53:52.420 --> 2:53:57.260]  we have had if we back away from that now we're gonna produce the same kind of
[2:53:57.260 --> 2:54:02.860]  mess that I think these people really want a top-down society in which among
[2:54:02.860 --> 2:54:08.100]  other things you have aggregated to a elitist few all of the opportunities for
[2:54:08.100 --> 2:54:13.020]  choice and left others in such an impoverished condition both spiritually
[2:54:13.020 --> 2:54:16.740]  emotionally and in terms of their sense of how they meet the challenge of the
[2:54:16.740 --> 2:54:21.220]  world that they become like clay that you can mold in any way you will and they
[2:54:21.220 --> 2:54:23.700]  have to be at the top I mean we get their white papers and we at least they're
[2:54:23.700 --> 2:54:27.500]  doing it on purpose but to go back to the 70s they only got California in a
[2:54:27.500 --> 2:54:31.860]  few other areas to do it the rewilding say don't cut any underbrush don't cut
[2:54:31.860 --> 2:54:36.820]  fire breaks and then they turn around and blame the power company PG&E when
[2:54:36.820 --> 2:54:40.740]  all of California burns down and Schwarzenegger says oh it's the global
[2:54:40.740 --> 2:54:44.540]  warming when they know full damn well that for thousands of years people take
[2:54:44.540 --> 2:54:47.580]  out the underbrush and do that or every time lightning strikes there's high
[2:54:47.580 --> 2:54:51.780]  winds you burn down so California won't let you cut the trees or trim the
[2:54:51.780 --> 2:54:56.380]  foliage and pick up the dead grass and leaves then these fire storms happen
[2:54:56.380 --> 2:55:01.140]  they blame humans but in a way it is it's the government of California that's
[2:55:01.140 --> 2:55:06.060]  exactly right and it's the government also taking resources away from what I
[2:55:06.060 --> 2:55:10.540]  think are the kind of policing responsibilities and by that I mean not
[2:55:10.540 --> 2:55:15.340]  only policing in the sense of order of human activity but I remember how that
[2:55:15.340 --> 2:55:19.060]  word used to be used when I was going I was an army brat and so you clean the
[2:55:19.060 --> 2:55:22.820]  house up yeah it meant cleaning the place up that cleaning out the things
[2:55:22.820 --> 2:55:27.180]  that would otherwise cause dangers if they were exposed to certain conditions
[2:55:27.180 --> 2:55:30.700]  it could be fire it could be slippery it could cause injury so you clean the
[2:55:30.700 --> 2:55:34.020]  place up instead of trying to clean the place up do you know what they're
[2:55:34.020 --> 2:55:37.820]  spending our money on like Paul Revere check stuff what they're spending our
[2:55:37.820 --> 2:55:43.660]  money on now y'all is importing their cadre into the United States under the
[2:55:43.660 --> 2:55:49.180]  rubric of refugee this and refugee that but without any regard for having a
[2:55:49.180 --> 2:55:54.140]  common commitment to make America better and stronger they're filling them full
[2:55:54.140 --> 2:55:58.260]  of hate when they get here exactly and they don't even you know there used to
[2:55:58.260 --> 2:56:01.740]  be a requirement you came to the United States that you had to show you were
[2:56:01.740 --> 2:56:06.100]  going to take care of yourself and act responsibly now when you come under the
[2:56:06.100 --> 2:56:09.980]  impetus not of individual aspiration I want to come here and join in and make
[2:56:09.980 --> 2:56:14.140]  my life better because this is a place where I had a bunch of special reports
[2:56:14.140 --> 2:56:19.060]  ready and some of these have not even premiered yet and if you got to go it's
[2:56:19.060 --> 2:56:22.900]  fine but I could always air these at a later time and when are you supposed to
[2:56:22.900 --> 2:56:26.300]  meet Mike Adams well we actually didn't pin down the time we were kind of
[2:56:26.300 --> 2:56:30.500]  waiting to see what happened here so well I think I have some time well how

[3:00:40.940 --> 3:00:47.740]  breaking stuff we're your project Veritas James O'Keefe our latest insider
[3:00:47.740 --> 3:00:51.980]  helped us expose CNN but now it's time to raise the stakes a new insider has
[3:00:51.980 --> 3:00:56.340]  come to project Veritas with secret video recordings hashtag Epstein cover
[3:00:56.340 --> 3:01:02.140]  up starting tomorrow November 5th this is exciting there's not just evil in the
[3:01:02.140 --> 3:01:05.860]  universe there's good what do you want to say about the Epstein situation well
[3:01:05.860 --> 3:01:09.500]  sadly I think that on the one hand Epstein's an illustration of how much
[3:01:09.500 --> 3:01:15.340]  evil there is on the other I think there is a comforting sense in all that's
[3:01:15.340 --> 3:01:20.460]  happening that at the end of the day Shakespeare was right and evil will out
[3:01:20.460 --> 3:01:25.180]  in other words a lot of what people think is going to be hidden is not hidden
[3:01:25.180 --> 3:01:29.140]  and people are starting to wake up to that and it's been a lot thanks to
[3:01:29.140 --> 3:01:33.020]  folks like yourself that's what I find so impressive people who have the
[3:01:33.020 --> 3:01:39.780]  courage to stand for the truth and that was actually one of the key concepts of
[3:01:39.780 --> 3:01:44.780]  Christian life to be to bear witness to the truth no matter what and I think you
[3:01:44.780 --> 3:01:48.620]  have certainly shown it over the years but you're not alone there are people
[3:01:48.620 --> 3:01:54.420]  say that's courage it's compulsive with me I can't even help it so what is that
[3:01:54.420 --> 3:01:57.300]  I mean that's that's different well that's still courage that just means that
[3:01:57.300 --> 3:02:02.340]  the source of that courage is constant and that source I believe is to be
[3:02:02.340 --> 3:02:07.340]  always open to the truth it's part of the difference between what was once
[3:02:07.340 --> 3:02:11.220]  education in America where the whole point was to open you to the truth to
[3:02:11.220 --> 3:02:14.940]  its discipline to its patterns the other thing I love about the way you handle
[3:02:14.940 --> 3:02:19.740]  the show and events is that you are always thinking things through you see
[3:02:19.740 --> 3:02:24.500]  the connections because of that that other people don't make and I've got to
[3:02:24.500 --> 3:02:29.380]  say the highest praise I can give to you I think is that that always reminds me
[3:02:29.380 --> 3:02:32.500]  of the founders of the United States people can say what they like about
[3:02:32.500 --> 3:02:35.460]  them but if you sit down with their writings and their letters and so forth
[3:02:35.460 --> 3:02:39.820]  they were people who if I can use the nasty word everybody says nasty word
[3:02:39.820 --> 3:02:45.340]  they were they were conspiracy theorists they were people who understood that first
[3:02:45.340 --> 3:02:49.460]  of all you can't accomplish anything if you are not breathing together talking
[3:02:49.460 --> 3:02:54.780]  together working out an understanding that allows you to move in concert that
[3:02:54.780 --> 3:03:00.100]  is in fact what it means to come together to covenant to do things as a
[3:03:00.100 --> 3:03:04.300]  body as a unit so it's a source of union and unity to have that common
[3:03:04.300 --> 3:03:09.820]  understanding that inspires you moves you like breath moves the the the chest
[3:03:09.820 --> 3:03:14.380]  up and down to do things on behalf of that common good and I think that's
[3:03:14.380 --> 3:03:18.900]  absolutely critical but I think it's also conspiracy in the sense that you
[3:03:18.900 --> 3:03:24.660]  think through the reality that people who stand against justice who want to do
[3:03:24.660 --> 3:03:30.060]  wrong rather than right are constantly thinking about ways to infiltrate and
[3:03:30.060 --> 3:03:34.340]  subvert what good people are trying to accomplish and if you're not willing to
[3:03:34.340 --> 3:03:39.540]  think like that and and anticipate events and recognize how things are
[3:03:39.540 --> 3:03:43.460]  working together for evil then you're not helping out to make sure they well
[3:03:43.460 --> 3:03:46.300]  that's it if you read what the founders they've learned from history they learn
[3:03:46.300 --> 3:03:50.660]  from wars they were involved in they were playing chess not checkers and they
[3:03:50.660 --> 3:03:54.540]  could see how evil would play games so they use our own evil nature against us
[3:03:54.540 --> 3:03:58.060]  like a separation of powers well that's why I think you have all these folks who
[3:03:58.060 --> 3:04:01.620]  are amongst the bad guys as I call them they're always trying to get people to
[3:04:01.620 --> 3:04:05.700]  be ashamed oh that's conspiracy there's that's about conspiracy yes these
[3:04:05.700 --> 3:04:09.060]  conspiracy notions I'm thinking to myself the only reason they don't want
[3:04:09.060 --> 3:04:13.980]  us to be listening to folks who think that way is because they don't want
[3:04:13.980 --> 3:04:18.460]  people to have the wherewithal to start thinking in a way that sees through
[3:04:18.460 --> 3:04:24.060]  their multi-dimensional and thought there's no way to go back to one
[3:04:24.060 --> 3:04:27.660]  dimension it one dimension isn't real I mean it's but that's that's that's how
[3:04:27.660 --> 3:04:30.220]  leftist are they're very one-dimensional and they just believe
[3:04:30.220 --> 3:04:33.900]  whatever crap they're told instead of researching the whole back end of it
[3:04:33.900 --> 3:04:37.420]  Alan Key's ladies and gentlemen he's gonna be taken over I'm gonna sit here
[3:04:37.420 --> 3:04:41.820]  dutifully when we come back he's gonna introduce the show everything and more
[3:04:41.820 --> 3:04:46.220]  we got a lot of breaking news I haven't hit yet there's a new speaking of like
[3:04:46.220 --> 3:04:51.500]  Adams he's got a new article out with a recommendation to the president
[3:04:51.500 --> 3:04:56.820]  folks ask me Alex why do you have two different types of iodine well that's
[3:04:56.820 --> 3:05:02.100]  because different types of physiology's different types of metabolic systems and
[3:05:02.100 --> 3:05:08.300]  people will like different formulas it's just that simple x3 is the deep earth
[3:05:08.300 --> 3:05:12.500]  crystal iodine and two other types because some people need all three types
[3:05:12.500 --> 3:05:18.300]  to absorb others like the pure atomic iodine get both they're both great for
[3:05:18.300 --> 3:05:22.740]  you whichever one you like use that and give the other to family or friends
[3:05:22.740 --> 3:05:28.220]  bottom line iodine is essential that's why I harp on it the globalist want you
[3:05:28.220 --> 3:05:33.220]  to be deficient in it for a lot of reasons lower IQ makes you sluggish you
[3:05:33.220 --> 3:05:37.020]  don't live as long it's simple get your high-quality iodine in four store calm
[3:05:37.020 --> 3:05:43.100]  and help fund the info or info or store calm we've got a huge sale running right
[3:05:43.100 --> 3:05:47.620]  now but it's about to end it's the iodine challenge both types of iodine with
[3:05:47.620 --> 3:05:51.340]  the selenium for 60% off together
[3:05:51.340 --> 3:06:08.980]  crashing through the lies and disinformation it's Alex Jones
[3:06:21.340 --> 3:06:23.340]  is going down
[3:06:23.340 --> 3:06:26.340]  going full time
[3:06:26.340 --> 3:06:29.340]  is a Chinese communist weekend
[3:06:29.340 --> 3:06:33.340]  and a criminal and that's just the whole thing
[3:06:33.340 --> 3:06:37.340]  America is a white and fighting bird
[3:06:37.340 --> 3:06:41.340]  America will never find out
[3:06:41.340 --> 3:06:46.340]  the end of 1984 is 1776
[3:06:46.340 --> 3:06:51.340]  the end of 1984 is 1776
[3:06:51.340 --> 3:06:56.340]  Hillary Clinton is an enemy of the American people
[3:06:56.340 --> 3:07:01.340]  Hillary Clinton is an enemy of America
[3:07:01.340 --> 3:07:06.340]  Hillary Clinton is openly calling for censorship of the American people
[3:07:06.340 --> 3:07:11.340]  Hillary Clinton is calling for censorship of the American people
[3:07:11.340 --> 3:07:18.340]  Hillary Clinton is openly calling for censorship of all patronage and nationalism
[3:07:18.340 --> 3:07:21.340]  Hillary Clinton is a criminal
[3:07:21.340 --> 3:07:25.340]  to steal, to steal our nation out of the China column
[3:07:25.340 --> 3:07:29.340]  Hillary Clinton is a criminal
[3:07:29.340 --> 3:07:33.340]  Hillary Clinton will never silence the American people
[3:07:33.340 --> 3:07:36.340]  America is a white
[3:07:36.340 --> 3:07:43.340]  America knows what's happening and infohours.com is exposing it
[3:07:43.340 --> 3:07:46.340]  America is back
[3:07:46.340 --> 3:07:49.340]  America is back
[3:07:49.340 --> 3:07:51.340]  America is back
[3:07:51.340 --> 3:07:53.340]  America is back
[3:07:53.340 --> 3:07:55.340]  America is back
[3:07:55.340 --> 3:07:57.340]  America is back
[3:07:57.340 --> 3:08:10.340]  America is back
[3:08:10.340 --> 3:08:12.340]  America is back
[3:08:12.340 --> 3:08:14.340]  America is back
[3:08:14.340 --> 3:08:19.340]  America is back
[3:08:19.340 --> 3:08:26.340]  Hillary Clinton is a war criminal and is involved in child sex trafficking on the scene.
[3:08:26.340 --> 3:08:33.340]  Hillary Clinton is involved with Jeffrey Epstein. Hillary Clinton flew on Jeffrey Epstein's
[3:08:33.340 --> 3:08:43.340]  pedophile aircraft. Democrats are a force there is. The entire American criminals that have failed to silence our speech.
[3:08:43.340 --> 3:08:52.340]  Big tech and the chai comms and Hillary has failed to silence America's speech.
[3:08:52.340 --> 3:09:02.340]  America is back. America is back. America is back. America is back. America is back.
[3:09:02.340 --> 3:09:11.340]  Hillary Clinton worked with a child in the last decade. Hillary Clinton wants to sexualize our children.
[3:09:11.340 --> 3:09:24.340]  Hillary Clinton is a war criminal. Hillary Clinton is a failure. Your Democratic Party is collapsing.
[3:09:24.340 --> 3:09:32.340]  Every city you control is collapsing into hell. Everyone is running from the Democrats and their meddling.
[3:09:32.340 --> 3:09:42.340]  Your so called power cop, the Democratic Party that found that the KKK is going down. The Democrats are KKK.
[3:09:42.340 --> 3:09:52.340]  The Democrats are KKK. The Democrats are KKK. The Democrats are KKK. The Democrats are KKK.
[3:09:52.340 --> 3:10:01.340]  Look they hope to bring them back to KKK. Down with the KKK. Down with the children's lady. Down with the KKK.
[3:10:01.340 --> 3:10:09.340]  As she said....Nope.... all with the KKK at Hillary. Down with the KKK at Hillary. Down with the Democrats that found
[3:10:09.340 --> 3:10:18.340]  that to KKK. Down with the Democrats that found the KKK. Down with the Democrats that found the KKK.
[3:10:18.340 --> 3:10:25.560]  Welcome back.
[3:10:25.560 --> 3:10:28.400]  I'm DeVadd.
[3:10:28.400 --> 3:10:35.440]  I'm DeVadd.
[3:10:35.440 --> 3:10:40.940]  That's't good.
[3:10:40.940 --> 3:10:51.780]  Welcome back. I'm Alan Keyes, believe it or not. Well, I know you were mistaking me
[3:10:51.780 --> 3:10:57.460]  for Alex Jones. At first glance, that happens quite frequently. But no, actually, it would
[3:10:57.460 --> 3:10:58.460]  happen quite frequently.
[3:10:58.460 --> 3:10:59.460]  We both got beards.
[3:10:59.460 --> 3:11:00.460]  If you're only listening, yes.
[3:11:00.460 --> 3:11:03.220]  We both love God. That's pretty similar.
[3:11:03.220 --> 3:11:09.140]  But you know, you had mentioned this Adam Schiff show that he put on. And the fact
[3:11:09.140 --> 3:11:14.740]  that I think that statement he made was actually typical of what's going on with impeachment.
[3:11:14.740 --> 3:11:19.500]  And if we could play the clip that we were going to play and let's roll that clip about
[3:11:19.500 --> 3:11:21.180]  what it represents, I think that would be good.
[3:11:21.180 --> 3:11:25.100]  Here he is reading a fake transcript. We're supposed to forget this.
[3:11:25.100 --> 3:11:31.140]  I hear what you want. I have a favor I want from you, though. And I'm going to say this
[3:11:31.140 --> 3:11:36.780]  only seven times so you better listen good. I want you to make up dirt on my political
[3:11:36.780 --> 3:11:39.380]  opponent, understand lots of it.
[3:11:39.380 --> 3:11:43.700]  On this and on that, I'm going to put you in touch with people, not just any people.
[3:11:43.700 --> 3:11:46.820]  I'm going to put you in touch with Attorney General of the United States, my attorney
[3:11:46.820 --> 3:11:55.180]  General Bill Barr. He's got the whole weight of the American law enforcement behind him.
[3:11:55.180 --> 3:11:59.500]  And I'm going to put you in touch with Rudy. You're going to love him, trust me.
[3:11:59.500 --> 3:12:03.740]  You know what I'm asking. And so I'm only going to say this a few more times in a few
[3:12:03.740 --> 3:12:07.220]  more ways.
[3:12:07.220 --> 3:12:11.740]  And by the way, don't call me again. I'll call you when you've done what I asked.
[3:12:11.740 --> 3:12:17.660]  And now he's back with, from all these secret hearings, with new transcripts, and the Republicans
[3:12:17.660 --> 3:12:21.860]  are saying those aren't transcripts either because they were there with the few representatives
[3:12:21.860 --> 3:12:26.020]  they could have, and they say it's more fake. Really? A guy that puts out fake transcripts
[3:12:26.020 --> 3:12:27.020]  is doing it again?
[3:12:27.020 --> 3:12:31.860]  Well, he's doing it again. And with Whitsap, how come he thinks he can get away with this?
[3:12:31.860 --> 3:12:36.460]  I thought it was really quite amazing that somebody would get out, make all of these
[3:12:36.460 --> 3:12:42.180]  statements like they were part of the conversation, when the transcript was already in the hands
[3:12:42.180 --> 3:12:46.580]  of people who were listening, and you would know immediately that this was a lie. The
[3:12:46.580 --> 3:12:53.700]  other thing I find pretty amazing is the fact that he talks about what was involved, as
[3:12:53.700 --> 3:12:59.740]  if there was some fundamental wrongdoing going on. But the only wrongdoing he could imagine
[3:12:59.740 --> 3:13:05.500]  was the wrongdoing he was making up. And that confesses that there was no there there. Do
[3:13:05.500 --> 3:13:08.740]  you think most people are missing this? Because I don't see how they could.
[3:13:08.740 --> 3:13:13.860]  And then they had a bunch of channels, including one of the channels you've worked for, MSNBC,
[3:13:13.860 --> 3:13:20.020]  boy, it was different back when you were there, actually put out other fake transcripts, and
[3:13:20.020 --> 3:13:26.580]  then the Morning Joe did, and then Chris Cuomo put out a fake one. And then when they get
[3:13:26.580 --> 3:13:32.340]  caught, they didn't even do retractions. They got caught lying so big in 2016, they now
[3:13:32.340 --> 3:13:36.100]  think, well, we'll just lie bigger in this time of the work, or is it just their nature
[3:13:36.100 --> 3:13:37.100]  and they can't help it?
[3:13:37.100 --> 3:13:41.820]  Well, I think they're hoping that the lie will run on legs and get wider distribution
[3:13:41.820 --> 3:13:45.420]  than the truth that follows is up. And that can be the case. I have a good friend who
[3:13:45.420 --> 3:13:50.860]  talks a lot about the concept of fertile fallacy. You plant the seed of a lie, and the lie starts
[3:13:50.860 --> 3:13:54.300]  to promulgate out there so quickly that the truth never catches up.
[3:13:54.300 --> 3:13:58.420]  Mark Twain said that a lie goes halfway around the world before the truth puts its pants
[3:13:58.420 --> 3:13:59.420]  on.
[3:13:59.420 --> 3:14:05.740]  That's right. But I think that in this case, they're overestimating the plausibility of
[3:14:05.740 --> 3:14:06.740]  their lie.
[3:14:06.740 --> 3:14:07.740]  Well, here's an example.
[3:14:07.740 --> 3:14:13.300]  And you also have a lot of people, by the way, who are disposed to think well of Donald
[3:14:13.300 --> 3:14:18.180]  Trump, and they're just going to be infuriated by the lie. Don't they get this?
[3:14:18.180 --> 3:14:23.300]  Well, you've been giving me some hope here, and I agree with you at the end of the day
[3:14:23.300 --> 3:14:27.500]  that evil never thinks about what it's doing and feels invincible to the moment it runs
[3:14:27.500 --> 3:14:28.500]  out of gas.
[3:14:28.500 --> 3:14:32.060]  I think like Wiley-Kyle, they've already run out over the cliff. They've got to figure
[3:14:32.060 --> 3:14:33.700]  out that before they fall.
[3:14:33.700 --> 3:14:38.380]  I think that's exactly what happens. I used to use that metaphor a lot in general about
[3:14:38.380 --> 3:14:42.540]  the impetus of evil, because I think that's how it works. And then suddenly they discover
[3:14:42.540 --> 3:14:47.100]  that they're standing on nothing. But I don't think it's going to be a sudden discovery
[3:14:47.100 --> 3:14:49.380]  for the people who are pushing for impeachment.
[3:14:49.380 --> 3:14:55.140]  They know absolutely from the beginning that there's no there, there. But part of what
[3:14:55.140 --> 3:15:01.380]  sustains them, and you can check me out on this, I think part of the problem with the
[3:15:01.380 --> 3:15:05.940]  discussion of impeachment is that we let them get away with talking about it as if you don't
[3:15:05.940 --> 3:15:08.460]  have to read the Constitution first.
[3:15:08.460 --> 3:15:12.620]  I think you have to read the Constitution before you start talking about impeachment.
[3:15:12.620 --> 3:15:18.340]  And they don't read it, obviously, because then they'd realize that the phrase high crimes
[3:15:18.340 --> 3:15:24.260]  and misdemeanors may not imply this or that particular crime, but it does imply that you
[3:15:24.260 --> 3:15:29.860]  have to show wrongdoing and wrongdoing, not in terms of their political interest. Because
[3:15:29.860 --> 3:15:36.500]  what they're mostly accusing Trump of now is that he dared to try to enforce law and
[3:15:36.500 --> 3:15:37.820]  investigate them.
[3:15:37.820 --> 3:15:42.620]  I think most Americans would take it for granted that you have to investigate crimes regardless
[3:15:42.620 --> 3:15:43.620]  of party.
[3:15:43.620 --> 3:15:46.420]  That was a short segment as we played that five-in-a-intro. We'll be right back with

[3:20:05.740 --> 3:20:10.820]  We're back. Welcome to the Alex Jones show. And today I Alan keys have the privilege of
[3:20:10.820 --> 3:20:16.260]  interviewing Alex Jones. There's something I wanted to talk about and we were going to
[3:20:16.260 --> 3:20:21.340]  get to the Epstein clip. But as a preface to that, I think one of the things that's becoming
[3:20:21.340 --> 3:20:26.300]  more and more apparent in the impeachment process and other things that are going on
[3:20:26.300 --> 3:20:31.460]  is what's called the role of the deep state deep state referring by the way to folks who
[3:20:31.460 --> 3:20:36.060]  are part of the permanent bureaucracy, but who are now involving themselves and have
[3:20:36.060 --> 3:20:42.660]  involved themselves apparently in trying to manipulate the outcomes of our elections.
[3:20:42.660 --> 3:20:46.740]  And one of the things that I find so shrewd about the way things are being cast by the
[3:20:46.740 --> 3:20:52.340]  media, they had us focusing attention on foreign manipulation. And I think that that was so
[3:20:52.340 --> 3:20:57.740]  that we wouldn't would be looking away from what is now quite clearly evidence that we
[3:20:57.740 --> 3:21:03.700]  have permanent career bureaucrats who have been fulfilling the nightmare of the founders
[3:21:03.700 --> 3:21:09.060]  that you'd have people in positions like that who would then usurp the choice of the people
[3:21:09.060 --> 3:21:13.900]  manipulate outcomes in such a way that they would take control of the government from
[3:21:13.900 --> 3:21:20.020]  those who have been elected. Do you think that the fate of Epstein was part of that?
[3:21:20.020 --> 3:21:24.060]  Oh, absolutely. I mean, going back to what you just said, I played this last week and
[3:21:24.060 --> 3:21:30.340]  even I couldn't believe it. They had Brennan and McLachlan, former CIA directors, big globalist.
[3:21:30.340 --> 3:21:34.580]  And they said, thank God with the deep state. And yes, we're going to remove Trump ourselves
[3:21:34.580 --> 3:21:38.740]  with our intelligence operatives. Yes, it is a coup. I don't know if you saw the clip.
[3:21:38.740 --> 3:21:44.660]  And it's just like, that's totally illegal. It's a rogue group, which would overthrow
[3:21:44.660 --> 3:21:48.780]  his third world countries. It's what killed Caesar. And I'm sitting there looking at cancer
[3:21:48.780 --> 3:21:53.740]  announcing itself. And one of the problems is for a lot of Americans,
[3:21:53.740 --> 3:21:57.340]  and I've had this with audiences, he asked them, who's the king of America? Who's the
[3:21:57.340 --> 3:22:02.900]  queen of America? Who is the monarch of America? And eventually, somebody in the audience will
[3:22:02.900 --> 3:22:06.860]  pipe up with the right answer. But it's surprising how often they go to the president. And isn't
[3:22:06.860 --> 3:22:10.820]  that in the end? It's them. Y'all, we are the king and queens here. The people of the
[3:22:10.820 --> 3:22:17.220]  United States is the sovereign body that then has the ultimate decision making over who
[3:22:17.220 --> 3:22:21.300]  staff is there. That's why we can walk into Congress, the House of the Senate office buildings
[3:22:21.300 --> 3:22:25.120]  and go right in their offices, because they work for us. That's right. And one of the
[3:22:25.120 --> 3:22:29.820]  things that then should occur to us when we're watching this is that when the deep state
[3:22:29.820 --> 3:22:33.420]  says, we're taking over, we're doing this, we're going to prejudice the elections that
[3:22:33.420 --> 3:22:39.220]  way, that's an actual attack on us, on our self government. They not only don't have
[3:22:39.220 --> 3:22:45.260]  the right to do it, but if they are doing it, it represents an actual effort to overthrow
[3:22:45.260 --> 3:22:51.260]  the government of by and for the people that the Constitution painstakingly means to establish.
[3:22:51.260 --> 3:22:56.300]  Why don't people get this? What's crazy for me is, what's crazy for me is I agree with
[3:22:56.300 --> 3:23:00.140]  you. We're winning because just six months ago, they were saying there is no deep state.
[3:23:00.140 --> 3:23:05.180]  It's insane. You're all liars. Trump is insane. Alex Jones is insane. Her Carlson is insane.
[3:23:05.180 --> 3:23:09.140]  Matt Drudge is insane versus saying that. And then now it's like, thank God for the deep
[3:23:09.140 --> 3:23:13.620]  state. Yes, we're going to remove him. Yes, the intelligence agencies are. I mean, they've
[3:23:13.620 --> 3:23:16.580]  gone from denying the intelligence agencies were involved in killing Kennedy, which we
[3:23:16.580 --> 3:23:21.660]  all know they were, to now just going down, right? We're going to do it. I mean, it's
[3:23:21.660 --> 3:23:25.580]  it's almost like that few good men part where they finally tricked the colonel into going,
[3:23:25.580 --> 3:23:30.100]  you bet we killed him because we had to do it. And we're going to do it. I mean, I'm
[3:23:30.100 --> 3:23:36.140]  hoping though, that that brazenness that is now characteristic of the way they approach
[3:23:36.140 --> 3:23:42.340]  this question is going to come back to haunt them. Because I do not believe, okay, y'all,
[3:23:42.340 --> 3:23:45.940]  maybe I'm wrong. I could be wrong. But my experience in life, and I have a little bit
[3:23:45.940 --> 3:23:52.140]  of it, has left me with a deep sense of respect for the common sense of the American people.
[3:23:52.140 --> 3:23:58.380]  Not everybody, but there are enough people out there who watch these events quietly reach
[3:23:58.380 --> 3:24:03.740]  the conclusions about the deceivers and the deceived and resolve that they're not going
[3:24:03.740 --> 3:24:05.700]  to be deceived.
[3:24:05.700 --> 3:24:10.380]  But the one thing I've never understood, Alex, people look at all these television networks,
[3:24:10.380 --> 3:24:16.140]  a lot of people. Now, why did the idea that they were fake news resonate? It resonated
[3:24:16.140 --> 3:24:21.060]  because a lot of individuals have come to that conclusion. They watch all this junk.
[3:24:21.060 --> 3:24:26.380]  They're kind of fascinated by it. It's like sort of watching a strange play of lights
[3:24:26.380 --> 3:24:32.220]  and so forth. You don't know really what's going on, but you fascinated by it. That fascination,
[3:24:32.220 --> 3:24:36.900]  however, has kept people tuning into these networks in a way that keeps them alive.
[3:24:36.900 --> 3:24:43.020]  I have one serious question. Why is it that everybody doesn't just starting to advise
[3:24:43.020 --> 3:24:47.460]  people who care about this country to turn them off? I think they're like that whole
[3:24:47.460 --> 3:24:51.420]  thing that people used to say about your teeth, ignore them, and they'll go away. I think
[3:24:51.420 --> 3:24:56.740]  if folks start tuning out these liars, knowing that they're liars, knowing that what they're
[3:24:56.740 --> 3:25:00.900]  doing is fake news, we need to turn them off.
[3:25:00.900 --> 3:25:05.860]  And that's why they up the lies to make them so outrageous that we then still have to
[3:25:05.860 --> 3:25:10.780]  engage them and say, hey, you're a liar. So now they basically just geek out and do the
[3:25:10.780 --> 3:25:14.660]  most outrageous things. Use the old definition of geek, not a computer geek, but like a person
[3:25:14.660 --> 3:25:20.100]  at the old theaters or at the circus, biting the head off a bat or whatever. That was the
[3:25:20.100 --> 3:25:24.580]  old geeks. They are now are just these exhibitionists that say more and more outrageous things
[3:25:24.580 --> 3:25:28.540]  to make us tune into them. They're the shock jocks, but they're not just doing it for
[3:25:28.540 --> 3:25:29.860]  shock. They're doing it for control.
[3:25:29.860 --> 3:25:33.820]  Exactly. And I think that it's time that folks who really care about the country, particularly
[3:25:33.820 --> 3:25:38.620]  because as far as I can tell, and this gets into another area with all Facebook and Twitter
[3:25:38.620 --> 3:25:44.460]  and the very kind of threats that you have been under, they're mobilizing to try to keep
[3:25:44.460 --> 3:25:49.100]  people who are willing to keep focusing on these kinds of outlets and the things that
[3:25:49.100 --> 3:25:54.420]  they're involved with, also under the thumb of what I call the tech tyrants, the people
[3:25:54.420 --> 3:25:59.180]  who have established a kind of virtual monopoly of certain kinds of social networks.
[3:25:59.180 --> 3:26:01.500]  Creating reservations of the idiots.
[3:26:01.500 --> 3:26:08.060]  But look y'all, as we get closer to the election, they are going to use this control to try
[3:26:08.060 --> 3:26:13.900]  to wipe out communication that goes contrary to the narrative that would help one of these
[3:26:13.900 --> 3:26:16.460]  commie socialists to take over the United States.
[3:26:16.460 --> 3:26:18.100]  Oh yeah, they're intensifying the censorship.
[3:26:18.100 --> 3:26:22.500]  I think without any doubt. And they mean to do it in a way that's carefully timed to
[3:26:22.500 --> 3:26:27.740]  make sure that people are deprived of information. Now here's the point that I think we often
[3:26:27.740 --> 3:26:33.220]  miss, and we need to start going back to the Constitution and asking fundamental questions.
[3:26:33.220 --> 3:26:38.740]  Because if you are making efforts to deprive the people of the United States of their ability
[3:26:38.740 --> 3:26:43.180]  to communicate with one another, and their ability to gather information from various
[3:26:43.180 --> 3:26:45.700]  sources, who are you attacking?
[3:26:45.700 --> 3:26:46.700]  The people.
[3:26:46.700 --> 3:26:50.300]  You're attacking the people, but it's the sovereign body of the people in the course
[3:26:50.300 --> 3:26:53.820]  of deliberating about its most important official.
[3:26:53.820 --> 3:26:55.060]  Your election meddling.
[3:26:55.060 --> 3:27:00.540]  Which is, but you're election meddling, but you're also attacking the sovereign himself
[3:27:00.540 --> 3:27:01.540]  or herself.
[3:27:01.540 --> 3:27:02.540]  It's an attack on the people.
[3:27:02.540 --> 3:27:03.540]  It's an attack on the people.
[3:27:03.540 --> 3:27:04.980]  You know what they used to call that?
[3:27:04.980 --> 3:27:10.260]  They used to call that less majesty, an attack on the body of the sovereign.
[3:27:10.260 --> 3:27:14.060]  This attack is now going on from these tech tyrants.
[3:27:14.060 --> 3:27:19.900]  And that attack, by the way, you should realize it, is a form of treason.
[3:27:19.900 --> 3:27:23.940]  It was punishable in the days of the old monarchs by death.
[3:27:23.940 --> 3:27:27.980]  And it seems to me, I'm not talking about punishing my death and so forth, that's nonsense.
[3:27:27.980 --> 3:27:32.380]  But I am talking about the fact that we make them responsible.
[3:27:32.380 --> 3:27:33.860]  It's a serious crime that...
[3:27:33.860 --> 3:27:34.860]  And how does Trump do that?
[3:27:34.860 --> 3:27:38.700]  And Mike Adams says, Trump must seize domains of Google, Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, stop
[3:27:38.700 --> 3:27:39.700]  censorship.
[3:27:39.700 --> 3:27:42.100]  Imagine if phone companies in the old days had AI.
[3:27:42.100 --> 3:27:45.340]  And they heard you saying, I'm going to support Ronald Reagan for president, and they turned
[3:27:45.340 --> 3:27:46.340]  your phone off.
[3:27:46.340 --> 3:27:49.380]  I mean, the Justice Department would take over.
[3:27:49.380 --> 3:27:53.820]  I always think, though, that before you take action, you need to establish the lawfulness
[3:27:53.820 --> 3:27:54.820]  of that action.
[3:27:54.820 --> 3:27:55.820]  Oh, I agree.
[3:27:55.820 --> 3:27:56.820]  In the eyes of the American people.
[3:27:56.820 --> 3:27:57.820]  So let's talk about the procedure.
[3:27:57.820 --> 3:28:02.540]  And that's why I say, first, get people to think about the real nature of this attack.
[3:28:02.540 --> 3:28:06.500]  They always want us to think about what's going on in terms of individual rights.
[3:28:06.500 --> 3:28:08.940]  They're attacking Alex Jones' individual rights.
[3:28:08.940 --> 3:28:09.940]  Oh, they were smart.
[3:28:09.940 --> 3:28:13.340]  They chose me to be the person they banned first, so the debate is about that, not everybody
[3:28:13.340 --> 3:28:14.340]  else.
[3:28:14.340 --> 3:28:15.340]  And they try to isolate you.
[3:28:15.340 --> 3:28:20.820]  What's going on is an attack on the body politic, an attack on the functionality of the people
[3:28:20.820 --> 3:28:21.820]  of the United States.
[3:28:21.820 --> 3:28:22.820]  Hold on.
[3:28:22.820 --> 3:28:23.820]  We got it going to break.
[3:28:23.820 --> 3:28:26.340]  Listen, I've watched you a lot on TV over the years for 30 years when you're an ambassador
[3:28:26.340 --> 3:28:27.340]  or all that.
[3:28:27.340 --> 3:28:28.340]  I always thought you were amazing.
[3:28:28.340 --> 3:28:30.740]  But it's almost like Obi-Wan could always be on the desert, and now he's back.
[3:28:30.740 --> 3:28:31.740]  I mean, this is amazing.
[3:28:31.740 --> 3:28:33.660]  But you know, a lot of stuff's happening.
[3:28:33.660 --> 3:28:38.500]  A lot of great people like you that have been out there still vocal are really rushing forward.
[3:28:38.500 --> 3:28:42.780]  I'm seeing now new folks, folks that have been around a long time, kind of get the big
[3:28:42.780 --> 3:28:44.820]  battles here going into 2020.
[3:28:44.820 --> 3:28:47.500]  I kind of get that feeling that you're charging up right now.
[3:28:47.500 --> 3:28:50.660]  Well, I think this moment is decisive.
[3:28:50.660 --> 3:28:53.660]  We can all agree these are troubled times, right?
[3:28:53.660 --> 3:28:56.660]  So do you know who's on your wireless network?
[3:28:56.660 --> 3:29:01.940]  Whether it's a big company selling your data or a foreign hacker, if you're not protected,
[3:29:01.940 --> 3:29:03.900]  everybody sees your information.
[3:29:03.900 --> 3:29:09.140]  That's why you need Flash routers, a custom Wi-Fi router created for privacy.

[3:29:51.860 --> 3:29:54.020]  All of our bodies are different.
[3:29:54.020 --> 3:29:56.900]  All of our metabolic systems are diverse.
[3:29:56.900 --> 3:29:59.900]  Some of us are deficient in some things and not in others.
[3:29:59.900 --> 3:30:03.340]  There's a lot of factors that go into this, and I'm not telling you something that you
[3:30:03.340 --> 3:30:06.700]  don't know, but I'm here to tell you.
[3:30:06.700 --> 3:30:14.340]  Every time I commit and use the supplements that we sell on a religious basis, my life
[3:30:14.340 --> 3:30:15.660]  completely changes.
[3:30:15.660 --> 3:30:16.660]  I'm healthier.
[3:30:16.660 --> 3:30:17.660]  I have more energy.
[3:30:17.660 --> 3:30:18.660]  I lose weight.
[3:30:18.660 --> 3:30:19.660]  I look better.
[3:30:19.660 --> 3:30:20.660]  Everybody notices.
[3:30:20.660 --> 3:30:28.140]  Two months ago, I said on air, I am going to commit to take X2, body's ultimate turmeric.
[3:30:28.140 --> 3:30:33.340]  I'm going to commit to flush my gut out with the gut fusion from M4's life.
[3:30:33.340 --> 3:30:38.300]  And when I take these products, the results are nothing less than miraculous.
[3:30:38.300 --> 3:30:44.220]  Well, one product that's amazing that I use, I don't talk enough about, is gut fusion folks.
[3:30:44.220 --> 3:30:45.220]  Check it out.
[3:30:45.220 --> 3:30:46.220]  There's nothing else like it.

[3:30:51.700 --> 3:30:53.740]  The Alex Jones Show.
[3:30:53.740 --> 3:30:59.140]  A few days ago, my 11-year-old daughter came to me and she had her digital textbook.
[3:30:59.140 --> 3:31:02.180]  She said, Dad, they're teaching us about the periodic table.
[3:31:02.180 --> 3:31:06.740]  And I clicked on iodine, and it says that 2 billion people have low IQs or mentally
[3:31:06.740 --> 3:31:10.140]  retarded on the planet Earth because they didn't get enough iodine.
[3:31:10.140 --> 3:31:13.940]  That's what you say all the time, but I've heard people say you're crazy, and it's not
[3:31:13.940 --> 3:31:14.940]  true.
[3:31:14.940 --> 3:31:19.300]  But Dad, it's right here on the periodic table when I click it saying exactly what you said.
[3:31:19.300 --> 3:31:24.700]  And I said, I know, honey, that's why I have you take a high-quality nutraceutical grade.
[3:31:24.700 --> 3:31:28.980]  Iodine is because it's why you're so vibrant, it's why you're so alive.
[3:31:28.980 --> 3:31:33.980]  It's one of the reasons that you're so much healthier and smarter than most of the kids
[3:31:33.980 --> 3:31:34.980]  you're age.
[3:31:34.980 --> 3:31:40.620]  And it just really blew her away to read it there for herself to know that 2 billion
[3:31:40.620 --> 3:31:45.020]  people, ladies and gentlemen, 2 billion are mentally retarded on the face of the Earth
[3:31:45.020 --> 3:31:47.500]  right now because of iodine deficiency.
[3:31:47.500 --> 3:31:49.540]  Research it and find out for yourself now.
[3:31:49.540 --> 3:31:51.380]  Infowars.com.
[3:31:51.380 --> 3:31:55.740]  We have strong disagreement on policy grounds, and I hope there's diversity in policy here.
[3:31:55.740 --> 3:31:57.620]  I don't care what your views are.
[3:31:57.620 --> 3:32:00.860]  I hope you articulate them and defend them and listen and debate them.
[3:32:00.860 --> 3:32:01.860]  That's important.
[3:32:01.860 --> 3:32:03.140]  But we have something in common.
[3:32:03.140 --> 3:32:07.260]  We have a set of values that are at the core of this country that hold this place together.
[3:32:07.260 --> 3:32:12.780]  Clinton deep state bag man, Comey thinks it's funny that he was the leaker and that he lied
[3:32:12.780 --> 3:32:14.420]  to Congress and the world.
[3:32:14.420 --> 3:32:18.900]  He thinks committing crimes are funny, and he thinks if he acts confident, he won't get
[3:32:18.900 --> 3:32:19.900]  indicted.
[3:32:19.900 --> 3:32:24.660]  But where it is, the criminal investigation is honing in on him.
[3:32:24.660 --> 3:32:27.860]  From my new home in New Zealand, I will...
[3:32:27.860 --> 3:32:32.980]  Oh, and now suddenly he's talking about moving to New Zealand.
[3:32:32.980 --> 3:32:34.860]  Not so fast, criminal.
[3:32:34.860 --> 3:32:38.820]  We're going to bring you to justice, and we're going to bring Hillary to justice as well.
[3:32:38.820 --> 3:32:43.540]  Because if we don't, you criminals will continue to strike back at your enemy.
[3:32:43.540 --> 3:32:48.420]  But the American people know how much you hate us, and we're fighting back at Infowars.com,
[3:32:48.420 --> 3:33:15.380]  NewsWars.com, and Band Dive Video.
[3:33:15.380 --> 3:33:23.140]  Coming to you live from the Infowars.com studios in the recaptured state of Texas.
[3:33:23.140 --> 3:33:29.260]  It's Alex Jones.
[3:33:29.260 --> 3:33:30.260]  Welcome back.
[3:33:30.260 --> 3:33:34.820]  I'm Alan Keyes, and this is, believe it or not, the Alex Jones show.
[3:33:34.820 --> 3:33:39.260]  Today I have the great privilege and honor, but also, I must say Alex has been a lot more
[3:33:39.260 --> 3:33:41.140]  fun than people might realize.
[3:33:41.140 --> 3:33:45.420]  As a matter of fact, it's possibly more fun than you should be allowed to have.
[3:33:45.420 --> 3:33:51.620]  I envy you, the permanent assignment here, but look, as we were going out, I think, you
[3:33:51.620 --> 3:33:57.140]  were making some points that made it occur to me that I hope that people in this country
[3:33:57.140 --> 3:34:00.740]  are not the least bit complacent anymore.
[3:34:00.740 --> 3:34:05.340]  The events of the last several years, and especially the reaction to the election in
[3:34:05.340 --> 3:34:11.260]  2016, but also all the aspects that have to do with a deep state, including some of these
[3:34:11.260 --> 3:34:16.180]  horrid events that have been taking place, that punctuate the fact that if you think
[3:34:16.180 --> 3:34:22.660]  it's possible to think of things too outlandish to occur, then you'd better start revising
[3:34:22.660 --> 3:34:24.060]  your thinking.
[3:34:24.060 --> 3:34:29.940]  This country, I think, and especially our form of constitutional self-government, rooted
[3:34:29.940 --> 3:34:35.340]  in the combination of the rule of law and the goodwill of the people acting together
[3:34:35.340 --> 3:34:36.500]  in concert.
[3:34:36.500 --> 3:34:41.340]  This regime is under serious threat, and I think that we're approaching an election
[3:34:41.340 --> 3:34:45.740]  that was in the shadow of 2016.
[3:34:45.740 --> 3:34:50.780]  I thought the bad guys thought that election was going to be their decisive triumph.
[3:34:50.780 --> 3:34:55.820]  The election that basically would guarantee their power so that then there'd be no more
[3:34:55.820 --> 3:34:57.340]  real elections again.
[3:34:57.340 --> 3:35:02.860]  And it was their arrogance that allowed God to mobilize the resistance to show them like
[3:35:02.860 --> 3:35:04.620]  the Titanic that they're not invincible.
[3:35:04.620 --> 3:35:06.260]  Yes, exactly.
[3:35:06.260 --> 3:35:12.740]  And I think that their frustration and all the venom and this kind of the rage and Trump
[3:35:12.740 --> 3:35:18.140]  derangement as it's called, all of it was because this was a furious check, and they're
[3:35:18.140 --> 3:35:24.380]  angry about it, but they're also absolutely determined that they're going to get it done
[3:35:24.380 --> 3:35:25.380]  no matter how they-
[3:35:25.380 --> 3:35:29.780]  Now they're running around like demon-possessed chickens with their heads cut off, and I agree
[3:35:29.780 --> 3:35:35.460]  with you, it's eliciting people to resist more and to steal themselves against it.
[3:35:35.460 --> 3:35:39.460]  I just did a gut level, a spiritual level, feel like though, as you said, if we aren't
[3:35:39.460 --> 3:35:43.340]  maximum energy against this, we shouldn't take anything for granted because they've
[3:35:43.340 --> 3:35:45.380]  got a lot of evil tricks up their sleeves.
[3:35:45.380 --> 3:35:48.820]  And I have to say two things, and I have to say it, I'll probably say it more than once
[3:35:48.820 --> 3:35:52.220]  in the course of the time we have left, but I think it's decisive.
[3:35:52.220 --> 3:35:58.380]  First and foremost for me, and it has been for years now, is that Americans have to remember
[3:35:58.380 --> 3:36:00.940]  the fundamental premise of our founding.
[3:36:00.940 --> 3:36:04.540]  And the fundamental premise of our founding, contrary to what a lot of people like to think,
[3:36:04.540 --> 3:36:06.460]  was not freedom.
[3:36:06.460 --> 3:36:09.660]  Freedom plays a role, but freedom is not the most important thing.
[3:36:09.660 --> 3:36:11.460]  What was the first appeal?
[3:36:11.460 --> 3:36:15.180]  The first appeal was to the authority of God, and the first-
[3:36:15.180 --> 3:36:17.140]  We're saying we follow God, not the king.
[3:36:17.140 --> 3:36:18.140]  Exactly.
[3:36:18.140 --> 3:36:19.140]  We follow God.
[3:36:19.140 --> 3:36:24.260]  The king departs from God, when the government departs from God, in terms of what's required
[3:36:24.260 --> 3:36:29.220]  for human justice and decency, we can't go down that road and we won't.
[3:36:29.220 --> 3:36:30.220]  So that's-
[3:36:30.220 --> 3:36:32.180]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[3:36:32.180 --> 3:36:33.180]  Amen.
[3:36:33.180 --> 3:36:37.820]  And the second thing we have to remember is that at the end of the day, we are the leaders
[3:36:37.820 --> 3:36:38.820]  here.
[3:36:38.820 --> 3:36:44.580]  I get a little irritated when people talk about leadership of any kind, including by
[3:36:44.580 --> 3:36:48.700]  the way, and I like Donald Trump, and I think he's been standing his ground in a way that
[3:36:48.700 --> 3:36:51.380]  people ought to be deeply grateful for.
[3:36:51.380 --> 3:36:56.940]  But I think we need to know that America is not what I call a furor constitution.
[3:36:56.940 --> 3:36:59.460]  Furor was the German word for leader, applied to Hitler.
[3:36:59.460 --> 3:37:00.460]  I'll say it.
[3:37:00.460 --> 3:37:03.100]  When Trump loves to flaunt it and rub it in the left's face, because I hate him so much,
[3:37:03.100 --> 3:37:06.860]  I get he's trolling them, but when he talks about how great a job he's doing, if he would
[3:37:06.860 --> 3:37:11.780]  just call on God openly, which he's starting to do, and thank the listeners and people
[3:37:11.780 --> 3:37:15.820]  that support him that are being persecuted, that would be the final step towards Trump
[3:37:15.820 --> 3:37:16.820]  really getting polished.
[3:37:16.820 --> 3:37:20.860]  And I'm not trying to critique the president, but I just think he needs to invoke God as
[3:37:20.860 --> 3:37:25.380]  he did at the RNC as he did in his inaugural speech.
[3:37:25.380 --> 3:37:27.460]  I think that's the real power.
[3:37:27.460 --> 3:37:31.260]  And as he did, by the way, when he went to the United Nations, that was incredible.
[3:37:31.260 --> 3:37:34.060]  A lot of people miss the power of that speech.
[3:37:34.060 --> 3:37:35.780]  That was a great speech.
[3:37:35.780 --> 3:37:39.940]  And it was a speech that I think when people take off their, their prejudicial blinder,
[3:37:39.940 --> 3:37:40.940]  some more of that.
[3:37:40.940 --> 3:37:46.580]  He was very humble, he was very, he actually gave a speech that stood in the line of American
[3:37:46.580 --> 3:37:48.460]  statesmanship all the way back to the beginning.
[3:37:48.460 --> 3:37:50.940]  Well, Lord Monkham was on, he said it was one of the greatest speeches ever.
[3:37:50.940 --> 3:37:53.180]  I thought it was a great speech.
[3:37:53.180 --> 3:38:00.260]  But I think that to compliment that offer of representative leadership, America has to
[3:38:00.260 --> 3:38:01.260]  represent.
[3:38:01.260 --> 3:38:02.260]  Well, God wants the contract.
[3:38:02.260 --> 3:38:03.260]  You're right.
[3:38:03.260 --> 3:38:04.260]  We need to say we want the contract.
[3:38:04.260 --> 3:38:09.020]  But Americans also have to remember the meaning of the word representative.
[3:38:09.020 --> 3:38:14.380]  How can you represent what hasn't been presented in the first place?
[3:38:14.380 --> 3:38:19.220]  And that means that from the point of view of our chosen and elected leaders, we are
[3:38:19.220 --> 3:38:21.140]  the their leaders.
[3:38:21.140 --> 3:38:25.860]  We are the ones who must set the tone for their hearts and for their objectives and for their
[3:38:25.860 --> 3:38:27.360]  understanding.
[3:38:27.360 --> 3:38:34.260]  And if we're not having the courage to take that leadership role, to make the demand that
[3:38:34.260 --> 3:38:39.460]  what is right for our common good be respected, what our constitution requires be respected,
[3:38:39.460 --> 3:38:46.740]  and what is needed for us to retain responsibility over our individual family and community lives
[3:38:46.740 --> 3:38:49.800]  is respected, then it's not going to happen.
[3:38:49.800 --> 3:38:54.940]  And that means that I think the challenge of elections is always about whether Americans
[3:38:54.940 --> 3:38:59.460]  themselves as voters, as citizens, are willing to take the lead.
[3:38:59.460 --> 3:39:04.220]  It used to be the case in America that when elections occurred, it was a usage in the
[3:39:04.220 --> 3:39:05.380]  19th century.
[3:39:05.380 --> 3:39:07.440]  You didn't say who's running for office.
[3:39:07.440 --> 3:39:12.080]  You would ask other people who are you running for office, meaning to say that was that image
[3:39:12.080 --> 3:39:14.900]  of the people who are you running leader.
[3:39:14.900 --> 3:39:20.020]  And I think we need to keep that in mind and take it to heart because otherwise, when you
[3:39:20.020 --> 3:39:26.140]  get an opportunity, Trump represents an opportunity, but that opportunity will fade if the people
[3:39:26.140 --> 3:39:32.420]  of this country are right to make sure that it comes to fruition.
[3:39:32.420 --> 3:39:33.420]  Exactly.
[3:39:33.420 --> 3:39:37.340]  And it's like Trump said, the tree's planted, but now it's got to have time to grow.
[3:39:37.340 --> 3:39:40.220]  And reading history books and things are absolutely right.
[3:39:40.220 --> 3:39:45.500]  People would go and recruit good men that were respected and they knew were steadfast
[3:39:45.500 --> 3:39:50.100]  in life, in business, in the military, in the clergy, and they would be drafted to run.
[3:39:50.100 --> 3:39:52.860]  People come and say, you are running for office.
[3:39:52.860 --> 3:39:54.540]  We are recruiting you.
[3:39:54.540 --> 3:39:55.660]  You're going to do it.
[3:39:55.660 --> 3:39:56.660]  And then they knew they had to.
[3:39:56.660 --> 3:39:57.660]  It wasn't like George Washington.
[3:39:57.660 --> 3:39:58.660]  They wanted him to be a king.
[3:39:58.660 --> 3:39:59.660]  He said, no way.
[3:39:59.660 --> 3:40:03.540]  He also was relucked, I mean, he stepped away from what could have been.
[3:40:03.540 --> 3:40:07.820]  He would have instantly been selected to be king of America or whatever.
[3:40:07.820 --> 3:40:10.220]  There are people who wanted that to happen.
[3:40:10.220 --> 3:40:16.860]  And he eschewed that and not only that, he had the kind of esteem amongst the soldiers
[3:40:16.860 --> 3:40:20.660]  who had fought in the Revolutionary War that he would certainly have had their support.
[3:40:20.660 --> 3:40:24.820]  But instead of appealing for it, when they were rising up to talk about their mistreatment,
[3:40:24.820 --> 3:40:28.780]  he could have seconded the motion, started like some of these communist dictators to
[3:40:28.780 --> 3:40:32.300]  get the military on your side so you can bash everybody's head in.
[3:40:32.300 --> 3:40:36.300]  Quite the contrary, I'll never forget the first time I read the account of a meeting
[3:40:36.300 --> 3:40:40.580]  he had with those who were all riled up because they thought they were being mistreated.
[3:40:40.580 --> 3:40:45.820]  And he walked into the room and he fumbled around for a minute when he got up to the
[3:40:45.820 --> 3:40:49.100]  podium because he was looking for his glasses.
[3:40:49.100 --> 3:40:55.500]  And he looked out to the audience and he said, excuse me, gentlemen, for I have grown
[3:40:55.500 --> 3:41:00.860]  blind as well as gray in the service of my country.
[3:41:00.860 --> 3:41:08.100]  And then having established that premise of service, he went on to calm them down.
[3:41:08.100 --> 3:41:13.420]  And he put himself in a position of retiring from public life and having to be sought out.
[3:41:13.420 --> 3:41:17.540]  And they had such incredible ways with words back then.
[3:41:17.540 --> 3:41:22.340]  I mean, he's not saying, I'm old and gray, I'm in charge, I did it all.
[3:41:22.340 --> 3:41:26.300]  He says, you know, I'm actually getting old and weak here in my service and made them
[3:41:26.300 --> 3:41:27.300]  all feel pathetic.
[3:41:27.300 --> 3:41:32.700]  Yes, yes, and made them all, I think, gave them all a reminder of the price that had
[3:41:32.700 --> 3:41:37.260]  been paid by them and by others for the liberty of the country.
[3:41:37.260 --> 3:41:44.220]  And I think sometimes that sense, that combination of self-confidence, yes, a willingness to
[3:41:44.220 --> 3:41:49.900]  understand what your life represented, but also humility and the willingness to shift
[3:41:49.900 --> 3:41:54.180]  the burden of that respect onto the people you're talking to.
[3:41:54.180 --> 3:41:59.700]  If this country is to see its liberty respected, is to see its government perpetuated, the
[3:41:59.700 --> 3:42:05.620]  people themselves will have to be the source of the right understanding and heart that
[3:42:05.620 --> 3:42:08.340]  literally comes together to lift that up.
[3:42:08.340 --> 3:42:10.940]  And that's why the globalists, and I don't want to show this, but we have to, we're
[3:42:10.940 --> 3:42:15.140]  going to have the Epstein Club when we come back, but let's play the man in a goblin outfit
[3:42:15.140 --> 3:42:16.460]  simulating the murder of a baby.
[3:42:16.460 --> 3:42:21.140]  We have to, I hate to watch it, the pleasure when he simulates killing the baby, to understand
[3:42:21.140 --> 3:42:22.300]  this evil spirit.
[3:42:22.300 --> 3:42:23.300]  Why do they do this?
[3:42:23.300 --> 3:42:25.300]  To show it to us, to train us, to accept it.
[3:42:25.300 --> 3:42:29.860]  I'm showing it to you so you don't accept it and you understand this is not an aberration
[3:42:29.860 --> 3:42:30.860]  with these people.
[3:42:30.860 --> 3:42:33.780]  This is the heart of their spirit.
[3:42:33.780 --> 3:42:34.780]  This is who they are.
[3:42:34.780 --> 3:42:37.140]  The first lie is that's a woman.
[3:42:37.140 --> 3:42:41.500]  The second lie is that's some wonderful art display with a bunch of sickos in some New
[3:42:41.500 --> 3:42:43.340]  York devil bar.
[3:42:43.340 --> 3:42:48.220]  They are doing lesser magic, they are exercising what they do in secret in front of you to
[3:42:48.220 --> 3:42:52.020]  flaunt it.
[3:42:52.020 --> 3:42:55.420]  Folks ask me, Alex, why do you have two different types of iodine?
[3:42:55.420 --> 3:43:01.820]  Well, that's because different types of physiology, different types of metabolic systems and people
[3:43:01.820 --> 3:43:03.540]  will like different formulas.
[3:43:03.540 --> 3:43:06.100]  It's just that simple.
[3:43:06.100 --> 3:43:11.140]  X3 is the deep earth crystal iodine and two other types because some people need all three
[3:43:11.140 --> 3:43:15.780]  types to absorb, others like the pure atomic iodine.
[3:43:15.780 --> 3:43:20.180]  Get both, they're both great for you, whichever one you like, use that and give the other
[3:43:20.180 --> 3:43:22.460]  to family or friends.
[3:43:22.460 --> 3:43:25.820]  Bottom line, iodine is essential, that's why I harp on it.
[3:43:25.820 --> 3:43:30.140]  The globalist want you to be deficient in it for a lot of reasons.
[3:43:30.140 --> 3:43:33.260]  Lower IQ, make sure sluggish, you don't live as long.
[3:43:33.260 --> 3:43:34.260]  It's simple.

[3:45:51.900 --> 3:45:56.060]  The time has come to defy the thought police.
[3:45:56.060 --> 3:45:59.580]  They are banning hundreds and hundreds of symbols every year.
[3:45:59.580 --> 3:46:04.940]  They're waging war on communication itself, as the Thabian Socialists promised they would
[3:46:04.940 --> 3:46:08.940]  do more than 70 years ago from their command base in England.
[3:46:08.940 --> 3:46:12.820]  We've had Oxford come out and banned clapping.
[3:46:12.820 --> 3:46:17.580]  The ADL and others will literally bankrupt you, kick you out of college, destroy you,
[3:46:17.580 --> 3:46:19.260]  have you arrested in some areas?
[3:46:19.260 --> 3:46:25.260]  If you do the OK symbol, that's the international sign language symbol for OK, they know what
[3:46:25.260 --> 3:46:26.380]  they're doing.
[3:46:26.380 --> 3:46:29.540]  These people are authoritarians and they're dangerous.
[3:46:29.540 --> 3:46:33.780]  And the answer to their attack on speech is to exercise it in their face.
[3:46:33.780 --> 3:46:38.940]  We have a, it's OK to be OK politically incorrect ball cap, it's black and white, very nice
[3:46:38.940 --> 3:46:43.580]  as the OK symbol on it, it's a great way to start conversations, infowars.com is on the
[3:46:43.580 --> 3:46:48.980]  back, get yours today at infowarstore.com and support free speech by supporting Infowars
[3:46:48.980 --> 3:46:54.420]  while having a great hat.
[3:46:54.420 --> 3:47:01.420]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:47:24.420 --> 3:47:29.460]  Well, we have a number of clips for you.
[3:47:29.460 --> 3:47:35.180]  In addition to what you just saw, there's this remarkable clip of a demon.
[3:47:35.180 --> 3:47:40.540]  And these people are actually, I think, using this to enure people to get them used to these
[3:47:40.540 --> 3:47:45.940]  sites and to almost try to assemble folks who will think that all of this is in good fun.
[3:47:45.940 --> 3:47:48.580]  And I answered that during the break.
[3:47:48.580 --> 3:47:50.500]  Is it evil for me to even show this?
[3:47:50.500 --> 3:47:55.740]  Well, I think it's not able to show it to an audience the point of which is to try to
[3:47:55.740 --> 3:48:01.260]  forewarn them against what is happening to our kids and against what is being done.
[3:48:01.260 --> 3:48:04.660]  I mean, these are people who at one and the same time will be doing these horrible things
[3:48:04.660 --> 3:48:10.300]  and then going off to host the drag queen story hour for our children and in much the
[3:48:10.300 --> 3:48:13.940]  same way trying to enure them to what?
[3:48:13.940 --> 3:48:19.460]  To the spectacle that ultimately represents atrocity, even as I believe the whole abortion
[3:48:19.460 --> 3:48:25.340]  thing and everything else has been used to get us used to the idea that somehow or another,
[3:48:25.340 --> 3:48:31.020]  that special sacrosanct quality of life, which is not being fringed, it doesn't exist.
[3:48:31.020 --> 3:48:35.260]  And now kill the old people and now the passing laws in New York, other areas to keep babies
[3:48:35.260 --> 3:48:37.380]  alive and then harvest the organs.
[3:48:37.380 --> 3:48:38.380]  Exactly.
[3:48:38.380 --> 3:48:41.020]  That human life is not to be respected.
[3:48:41.020 --> 3:48:45.420]  I mean, that idea, which comes from the scripture, which was so profoundly important to the founding
[3:48:45.420 --> 3:48:48.540]  of America, that we are made in the image and likeness of God.
[3:48:48.540 --> 3:48:49.540]  What does that mean?
[3:48:49.540 --> 3:48:53.020]  It means that when you strike a blow against another human being to kill them, you are
[3:48:53.020 --> 3:48:55.420]  striking a blow against God.
[3:48:55.420 --> 3:49:02.660]  Though we are simply finite beings, we yet have a connection to the divine being that
[3:49:02.660 --> 3:49:04.020]  is responsible for the creation of God.
[3:49:04.020 --> 3:49:08.500]  And if people don't care about human life, no, then we're all going to just kill each
[3:49:08.500 --> 3:49:09.500]  other.
[3:49:09.500 --> 3:49:12.580]  And I think that's what they want to get us used to, but it's not because we're all
[3:49:12.580 --> 3:49:14.180]  going to kill each other.
[3:49:14.180 --> 3:49:17.380]  It's because they're going to recruit folks who are susceptible to that.
[3:49:17.380 --> 3:49:22.060]  Did you ever ask yourself, just by the way, how is it that the Nazis could have found
[3:49:22.060 --> 3:49:24.140]  all those concentration camp guards?
[3:49:24.140 --> 3:49:25.540]  Where did they come from?
[3:49:25.540 --> 3:49:32.420]  What kind of people would preside over a place of militant death and death dealing in the
[3:49:32.420 --> 3:49:36.020]  most heartless and cold-blooded way?
[3:49:36.020 --> 3:49:42.820]  Well, I think we, as a people, are being subjected to a campaign to make sure we have identified
[3:49:42.820 --> 3:49:47.860]  and pulled out from amongst the populace the people who have that potential because they
[3:49:47.860 --> 3:49:53.700]  mean to turn them against the rest of us and to put us in, and it adds, we can talk about
[3:49:53.700 --> 3:49:54.700]  this some other day.
[3:49:54.700 --> 3:49:56.500]  In fact, I start rolling in the background with some audios.
[3:49:56.500 --> 3:50:00.140]  People can see it because when people need to understand that this is who's coming to
[3:50:00.140 --> 3:50:01.140]  your children.
[3:50:01.140 --> 3:50:02.140]  Right.
[3:50:02.140 --> 3:50:03.140]  A little bit of audio in the background.
[3:50:03.140 --> 3:50:04.140]  Go ahead.
[3:50:04.140 --> 3:50:08.460]  And I think this kind of thing in recruiting people for that lack of sensibility to the
[3:50:08.460 --> 3:50:15.140]  significance of death is actually preparing us for the time when such people will be unleashed
[3:50:15.140 --> 3:50:21.780]  against us to commit the kind of purges that were committed in other countries.
[3:50:21.780 --> 3:50:26.620]  And again, a Hollywood actor could not do as well as this man dresses a woman killing
[3:50:26.620 --> 3:50:27.620]  a baby does.
[3:50:27.620 --> 3:50:32.900]  I mean, the satanic evil and these men all have that same look, black or white.
[3:50:32.900 --> 3:50:33.900]  It doesn't matter.
[3:50:33.900 --> 3:50:36.580]  They have that same demonic, Joker-esque look.
[3:50:36.580 --> 3:50:40.500]  They dress like demons and go to these story times, the women, the kids are crying and begging
[3:50:40.500 --> 3:50:45.060]  and they put the kid on their lap and then those kids basically simulate sex with the
[3:50:45.060 --> 3:50:46.060]  men.
[3:50:46.060 --> 3:50:47.060]  I can show you all the video.
[3:50:47.060 --> 3:50:48.060]  It's unbelievable.
[3:50:48.060 --> 3:50:49.060]  This is being done in Austin.
[3:50:49.060 --> 3:50:50.060]  It's being done.
[3:50:50.060 --> 3:50:51.060]  I can't believe it.
[3:50:51.060 --> 3:50:55.260]  And then the men go to the city councils and say, we're going to groom your kids.
[3:50:55.260 --> 3:50:56.260]  Give them to us.
[3:50:56.260 --> 3:51:03.220]  I think it's necessary for people to have it in their minds that this is in the background.
[3:51:03.220 --> 3:51:09.060]  If it is revolting to adult sensibilities where you have a conscience about the spilling
[3:51:09.060 --> 3:51:14.820]  of blood and about the respect that we should have for our offspring, what do you think
[3:51:14.820 --> 3:51:21.300]  it does to children to start to be introduced to this kind of mentality?
[3:51:21.300 --> 3:51:27.100]  And then we wonder why it is that violence grows in the society and violence, by the
[3:51:27.100 --> 3:51:32.140]  way, which not only takes the form of violence against others, but rising sense of hopelessness
[3:51:32.140 --> 3:51:39.260]  and then we're told this is a woman, a man killing a baby is a woman and even the daily
[3:51:39.260 --> 3:51:42.540]  caller and everyone calls it a trans woman did this.
[3:51:42.540 --> 3:51:47.540]  No, it's a demonic, crazy, mentally ill man who on his own website says he's a devil
[3:51:47.540 --> 3:51:49.980]  worshiper that loves Satan.
[3:51:49.980 --> 3:51:56.220]  But the question then becomes, why are we as a people going down a path that essentially
[3:51:56.220 --> 3:52:00.060]  institutionalizes the mentality represented in all of that?
[3:52:00.060 --> 3:52:01.180]  Is the devil's real?
[3:52:01.180 --> 3:52:06.780]  Because the mentality of baby killing had to be promoted and it has been made into something.
[3:52:06.780 --> 3:52:10.340]  First of all, they call it falsely lawful when it is against the law.
[3:52:10.340 --> 3:52:13.680]  The Constitution makes it clear that you can't deprive a person of life, liberty, or
[3:52:13.680 --> 3:52:14.680]  not.
[3:52:14.680 --> 3:52:15.680]  And they said it was a fetus forever.
[3:52:15.680 --> 3:52:16.680]  Now they go, yeah, it is a baby.
[3:52:16.680 --> 3:52:20.540]  Have you seen all the national news and comedy shows where they go, we like to kill babies
[3:52:20.540 --> 3:52:21.980]  and bully them in the womb.
[3:52:21.980 --> 3:52:22.980]  We're liberals.
[3:52:22.980 --> 3:52:24.380]  Now get in there and kill that baby.
[3:52:24.380 --> 3:52:25.380]  Have you seen those videos?
[3:52:25.380 --> 3:52:32.420]  How do you really believe though that that lack of sensitivity to conscience and to the
[3:52:32.420 --> 3:52:36.380]  conscience of a great many Americans is actually winning them support?
[3:52:36.380 --> 3:52:38.300]  I think they've no, no, I agree.
[3:52:38.300 --> 3:52:39.300]  I'll be honest.
[3:52:39.300 --> 3:52:42.620]  I'm not a person that wants to go out and hurt people.
[3:52:42.620 --> 3:52:46.980]  But when I see people on TV going, I love killing little kids and it's so much fun to
[3:52:46.980 --> 3:52:47.980]  bully him.
[3:52:47.980 --> 3:52:49.660]  When I chop them up, this is Comedy Central.
[3:52:49.660 --> 3:52:52.300]  I want to get in the car, drive to New York and hurt some people.
[3:52:52.300 --> 3:52:53.300]  I'm not going to do it.
[3:52:53.300 --> 3:52:57.300]  But I'm saying, I think they're trying to invoke us to do violence because they know
[3:52:57.300 --> 3:52:58.580]  they're losing the culture war.
[3:52:58.580 --> 3:53:03.140]  Well, I think they're losing the culture war though, because Americans are not by nature
[3:53:03.140 --> 3:53:06.100]  people who embrace violence against the innocent.
[3:53:06.100 --> 3:53:07.100]  No, I know.
[3:53:07.100 --> 3:53:08.100]  So what does it do to you when you see that?
[3:53:08.100 --> 3:53:13.420]  Well, what it does to me, I think it revolts people and it makes them angry.
[3:53:13.420 --> 3:53:20.340]  But I also think it reminds people of the difference between what we are in terms of
[3:53:20.340 --> 3:53:25.660]  our profession of respect for God and for life and our own respect for ourselves.
[3:53:25.660 --> 3:53:32.980]  After all, the passage that I can use everywhere in America with every audience is we are endowed
[3:53:32.980 --> 3:53:36.900]  by our Creator with certain unalienable rights among these life, liberty and the pursuit
[3:53:36.900 --> 3:53:38.180]  of happiness.
[3:53:38.180 --> 3:53:43.540]  This sense that somehow there's a special quality in the relationship between human
[3:53:43.540 --> 3:53:47.540]  life and God and respect for life and our own decency.
[3:53:47.540 --> 3:53:49.980]  They have not slain this in the American people.
[3:53:49.980 --> 3:53:55.860]  They will not slay it for all they have tried to unleash these epidemics of atrocity through
[3:53:55.860 --> 3:53:57.420]  abortion and other things.
[3:53:57.420 --> 3:53:59.900]  Well, I'll point out one thing.
[3:53:59.900 --> 3:54:06.700]  Why is it that this decision in Roe v. Wade is one of the only times apart from Dred Scott
[3:54:06.700 --> 3:54:11.100]  and other things associated with slavery, when the Supreme Court makes a decision and
[3:54:11.100 --> 3:54:12.340]  it doesn't stick.
[3:54:12.340 --> 3:54:14.980]  And now, by the way, because of the facts of our system.
[3:54:14.980 --> 3:54:15.980]  Because it's evil.
[3:54:15.980 --> 3:54:17.580]  America is going to reject abortion.
[3:54:17.580 --> 3:54:22.500]  America is going to reject it and even more so because our science has already rejected
[3:54:22.500 --> 3:54:23.500]  it.
[3:54:23.500 --> 3:54:28.540]  And what was predicted, by the way, in the language of Roe, if the suggestion of personhood
[3:54:28.540 --> 3:54:34.620]  be established, that's what the decision said, the complainant, that's Roe, the complainant's
[3:54:34.620 --> 3:54:36.140]  case collapses.
[3:54:36.140 --> 3:54:38.140]  Roe has collapsed under the weight of the American people.
[3:54:38.140 --> 3:54:41.380]  And that's why now they have to change the argument and say, okay, we'll kill babies after
[3:54:41.380 --> 3:54:42.380]  they're born.
[3:54:42.380 --> 3:54:43.380]  We'll kill old people.
[3:54:43.380 --> 3:54:45.980]  Now we have to give God like power to the state.
[3:54:45.980 --> 3:54:49.780]  But once they do that, they have lost the argument.
[3:54:49.780 --> 3:54:50.780]  They have.
[3:54:50.780 --> 3:54:51.780]  They have lost the issue.
[3:54:51.780 --> 3:54:52.780]  So they're losing.
[3:54:52.780 --> 3:54:53.780]  They're losing.
[3:54:53.780 --> 3:54:54.900]  But why is it that we don't know that?
[3:54:54.900 --> 3:54:56.380]  Because we haven't called them on it yet.
[3:54:56.380 --> 3:55:01.340]  I think around the country, even among pro-life people, there are folks who haven't yet realized
[3:55:01.340 --> 3:55:03.100]  that Roe is dead.
[3:55:03.100 --> 3:55:07.140]  And we don't have to go back to the Supreme Court and ask whether it's dead because the
[3:55:07.140 --> 3:55:08.700]  decision itself continues.
[3:55:08.700 --> 3:55:12.540]  And all the bullshit young people are against abortion now.
[3:55:12.540 --> 3:55:14.220]  But what do you do about it?
[3:55:14.220 --> 3:55:15.220]  You got to come back.
[3:55:15.220 --> 3:55:16.220]  You got to come back and talk about this.
[3:55:16.220 --> 3:55:17.220]  What do you do about it?
[3:55:17.220 --> 3:55:18.220]  Come back any time you want.
[3:55:18.220 --> 3:55:19.220]  But I want to play the Epstein clip.
[3:55:19.220 --> 3:55:20.220]  Then we'll talk about it.
[3:55:20.220 --> 3:55:21.220]  Oh, yeah.
[3:55:21.220 --> 3:55:22.220]  Here's the Epstein clip with the Navy.
[3:55:22.220 --> 3:55:26.020]  Well, not the Navy shield, but the Delta Force dog guy talking about Epstein quickly.
[3:55:26.020 --> 3:55:29.900]  And then actually what the medical examiner, famous medical examiner said about it, here
[3:55:29.900 --> 3:55:30.900]  it is.
[3:55:30.900 --> 3:55:35.980]  And then finish dog from a professional or just don't get one at all.
[3:55:35.980 --> 3:55:39.980]  And Epstein didn't kill himself.
[3:55:39.980 --> 3:55:44.940]  I was asked by the brother, the next of kin, to be at the autopsy.
[3:55:44.940 --> 3:55:51.060]  And at the autopsy on day one, there were findings that were unusual for suicidal hanging
[3:55:51.060 --> 3:55:58.140]  and more consistent with ligature, homicidal strangulation, which included.
[3:55:58.140 --> 3:56:02.740]  And he was suggested at the time that he committed suicide by doing what?
[3:56:02.740 --> 3:56:10.220]  By hanging at the time he was found allegedly hanging by a homemade ligature of sheets.
[3:56:10.220 --> 3:56:12.340]  Are you saying you don't think it was suicide?
[3:56:12.340 --> 3:56:16.140]  I think that the evidence points toward homicide rather than suicide.
[3:56:16.140 --> 3:56:20.060]  That's a famous medical examiner who examined the body at the autopsy.
[3:56:20.060 --> 3:56:21.860]  So just again, the wheels are coming off.
[3:56:21.860 --> 3:56:25.260]  Well, I think the wheels are coming off in so many different respects.
[3:56:25.260 --> 3:56:30.700]  And it's interesting to me that it all has to do with the unleashing of this kind of
[3:56:30.700 --> 3:56:37.580]  epidemic of death and killing as a replacement for what has been our politics of responsible
[3:56:37.580 --> 3:56:38.580]  choice.
[3:56:38.580 --> 3:56:39.580]  I agree.
[3:56:39.580 --> 3:56:40.580]  Come back very soon, Alan Keyes.
[3:56:40.580 --> 3:56:41.580]  One of the best interviews ever.
[3:56:41.580 --> 3:56:42.580]  Briefly.
[3:56:42.580 --> 3:56:43.580]  How do we fix abortion?
[3:56:43.580 --> 3:56:44.580]  I mean, how do we stop it?
[3:56:44.580 --> 3:56:49.420]  Well, we have to go to our executives and say that the Constitution is back in play.
[3:56:49.420 --> 3:56:50.580]  Roe has collapsed.
[3:56:50.580 --> 3:56:57.820]  And that means that the constitutional provisions which require that you extend equal protection
[3:56:57.820 --> 3:57:00.180]  of the law to all persons.
[3:57:00.180 --> 3:57:04.460]  And if they now admit, which they have to, because of our science, that from the moment
[3:57:04.460 --> 3:57:09.980]  of conception, the baby in the womb is a person, according to our Constitution, you cannot
[3:57:09.980 --> 3:57:10.980]  withdraw the protection of the law.
[3:57:10.980 --> 3:57:11.980]  That's right.
[3:57:11.980 --> 3:57:12.980]  Powerful.
[3:57:12.980 --> 3:57:13.980]  Thank you.
[3:57:13.980 --> 3:57:14.980]  Really appreciate you.
[3:57:14.980 --> 3:57:15.980]  Folks, I didn't plug the last two hours.
[3:57:15.980 --> 3:57:16.980]  We find ourselves in forestore.com.
[3:57:16.980 --> 3:57:17.980]  Big sales.
[3:57:17.980 --> 3:57:18.980]  Are about to end.
