[00:00.000 --> 00:18.000]  It for Wars. Tomorrow's news. Today.
[00:18.000 --> 00:31.000]  Send in the clowns. Send in the clowns. Don't bother.
[00:31.000 --> 00:51.000]  They're here. Isn't it rich? Isn't it queer?
[00:51.000 --> 01:04.000]  Losing my timing this late in my career. Where are the clowns?
[01:04.000 --> 01:13.000]  I got them $1.9 trillion relief so far. They're going to be getting checks in the mail that are consequential.
[01:13.000 --> 01:28.000]  I wrote the bill on the environment. Pay them more. This is an employees bargaining chip now. What's happening?
[01:28.000 --> 01:40.000]  The clowns. Don't bother. They're here.
[01:40.000 --> 01:46.000]  Thank you, blue eyes. Telling us like it is from the grave.
[01:46.000 --> 01:51.000]  Isn't it rich?
[01:51.000 --> 01:56.000]  It's a live Friday transmission on the student 25th.
[01:56.000 --> 02:07.000]  And General Flynn, former head of defense intelligence agency, former national security advisor to the real president, has come out in a absolutely key analysis and said,
[02:07.000 --> 02:17.000]  the globalists are going to stage false flags ahead of the evidence of the audit being overwhelming and other states joining the audit.
[02:17.000 --> 02:29.000]  This is just simply what all the preparation has been about at the Pentagon, but the critical radical brainwashing has been about with the race theory.
[02:29.000 --> 02:40.000]  All of this has been prepping it to say that anyone that opposes open borders, global government, election fraud, disarmament, sell out to China is a white supremacist.
[02:40.000 --> 02:53.000]  And even mainstream news has now basically gotten that and understood that and are now saying any opposition to even force inoculations or lockdowns is white supremacist.
[02:53.000 --> 03:00.000]  So that's how they're dividing the American people up, white against black, hoping they can confuse people to join the globalist side.
[03:00.000 --> 03:03.000]  It is an incredible time to be alive.
[03:03.000 --> 03:06.000]  And the wheels are all really coming off right now.
[03:06.000 --> 03:11.000]  Look at this interesting tweet by Major Patriot. Let me get this straight.
[03:11.000 --> 03:22.000]  Within 24 hours of Mike Lindell's, Sidney Powell and Rudy Giuliani appearing in court to address Dominion voting system lawsuits.
[03:22.000 --> 03:27.000]  Giuliani gets his law license yanked.
[03:27.000 --> 03:34.000]  A building in the same neighborhood where members of Trump family reside completely collapses.
[03:34.000 --> 03:37.000]  John McAvie commits suicide.
[03:37.000 --> 03:46.000]  Biden threatens F-15 airstrikes armed with nukes against Americans who want to take on the government.
[03:46.000 --> 03:53.000]  That's the whole part of the crazy atmosphere that is unfolding.
[03:53.000 --> 03:57.000]  You know, I'm taping some big interviews today and tomorrow for a special Saturday show.
[03:57.000 --> 04:00.000]  We're going to air at 4pm Central.
[04:00.000 --> 04:03.000]  And I was talking to Ted Nugent, his great wife today.
[04:03.000 --> 04:05.000]  We were taping for it.
[04:05.000 --> 04:10.000]  She's like, hey, I was watching your show yesterday. I was listening and you were really down.
[04:10.000 --> 04:12.000]  You need to be more upbeat.
[04:12.000 --> 04:19.000]  I haven't had somebody at a gas station say, hey, Alex, I was listening today and you really need to be more upbeat.
[04:19.000 --> 04:21.000]  People are really waking up.
[04:21.000 --> 04:27.000]  And then I've been contacted by a lot of really prominent people saying, hey, there's a great awakening happening.
[04:27.000 --> 04:30.000]  You're the tip of the spear and we're with you and be positive.
[04:30.000 --> 04:32.000]  And so I appreciate all of that.
[04:32.000 --> 04:35.000]  And I appreciate the crew putting up with me.
[04:35.000 --> 04:38.000]  People were asking me yesterday why I was flipping out.
[04:38.000 --> 04:47.000]  I mean, this is so real and I knew it was real, but it's so sad to see this evil still going forward despite the fact it should be easy to defeat.
[04:47.000 --> 04:49.000]  But really, that's part of God's plan.
[04:49.000 --> 04:51.000]  So we got one hell of a broadcast lined up for you.
[04:51.000 --> 04:55.000]  I just wanted to thank all the folks that support me and I need your prayers.
[04:55.000 --> 04:56.000]  So thank you.
[04:56.000 --> 05:09.000]  We'll be right back today with us all the evil men in towering seem to flourish as the good men do nothing. Well, I'm trying to be a good man.
[05:09.000 --> 05:17.000]  I'm trying to stand up to the right thing and I've seen huge effects with what we've done here in implores other good men and women getting together and telling the truth and standing up to corruption.
[05:17.000 --> 05:19.000]  But now the globals are coming after us.
[05:19.000 --> 05:20.000]  And so I need your prayers.
[05:20.000 --> 05:21.000]  I need your financial support.
[05:21.000 --> 05:24.000]  I need your word of mouth to stay in the fight.
[05:24.000 --> 05:33.000]  We've got a big sale going right now pre shipping double patriot points on three items that have been sold out ultimate grill oil 40% off X3 60% off best you'll ever on that.
[05:33.000 --> 05:39.000]  And of course bio tricillinium that is essential for every action of every cell in your body.
[05:39.000 --> 05:40.000]  It's 50% off.
[05:40.000 --> 05:45.000]  They're all back in stock right now and before we're short on calm and it's you that has kept us on air.
[05:45.000 --> 05:46.000]  It is you that has spread the word.
[05:46.000 --> 05:50.000]  It is you that have built this operation and we're now needed more than ever.
[05:50.000 --> 06:00.000]  So please continue to shop and then for sort of calm and please share the fact that this is an incredible line of products with your friends, your family, neighbors, strangers, you name it at the same time.
[06:00.000 --> 06:26.000]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen, when you live in denial, you live in great tyranny and bad times.
[06:26.000 --> 06:30.000]  Well, you embrace God and justice.
[06:30.000 --> 06:38.000]  Well, then, ladies and gentlemen, you live in a world that is a lot safer and a lot better.
[06:38.000 --> 06:41.000]  More like Mayberry RFP.
[06:41.000 --> 06:48.000]  Again, thank you for joining us on this June 25 2021 Friday transmission.
[06:48.000 --> 06:55.000]  Let me do my best as I try so often to do and just give you an overview of what's coming up today.
[06:55.000 --> 07:02.000]  We have several big guests in studio, one of which already had the studio yesterday.
[07:02.000 --> 07:07.000]  I was very impressed by the sincerity and energy brought tears to my eyes.
[07:07.000 --> 07:16.000]  I was like, quote, great guitarist, a great songwriter standing next to his, his fire.
[07:16.000 --> 07:29.000]  We have a mage tour joining us again in studio, and we have a Jeremy Brown, who is the green beret who the feds tried to get to infiltrate the patriot movement and set people up.
[07:29.000 --> 07:43.000]  And that goes into all the new news coming out documenting that most of the people that first attacked the police and triggered the police response that then triggered the leading edge of the Trump demonstration to fight back and then breach the capital.
[07:43.000 --> 07:50.000]  That indeed that was a provocateur false flag operation.
[07:50.000 --> 07:58.000]  So that is coming up and Jeremy Brown, it was just on American Journal doing a great job with the program before me here at info wars.
[07:58.000 --> 08:01.000]  Harrison Smith, he will be in studio with us as well.
[08:01.000 --> 08:09.000]  And then Friday's host, fourth hour, Stu Peters, the known Troyer and the war room three to six p.m.
[08:09.000 --> 08:16.000]  Okay, so that's what we've got, guesswise, the COVID news gets more intense every day.
[08:16.000 --> 08:24.000]  A lot of this is news that came out yesterday that didn't properly cover and new stuff that's broken, but it's just one of these articles alone.
[08:24.000 --> 08:35.000]  You could do the whole four hours on the CDC and the FDA have come out and said,
[08:35.000 --> 08:43.000]  We're putting a warning on the mRNA vaccines Moderna and Pfizer that it can cause heart attacks.
[08:43.000 --> 08:48.000]  But we already knew that you saw what happened in Europe where they started giving the shots first in the UK.
[08:48.000 --> 08:59.000]  So incredible that they brought an experimental vaccine on the market that when they did other tests on rodents eight years ago in Texas at UT, it did the same damn thing.
[08:59.000 --> 09:02.000]  Oh, but Fauci didn't know about some study at UT.
[09:02.000 --> 09:06.000]  Yeah, he did. He paid for it. His name is on the study.
[09:06.000 --> 09:15.000]  That's why I get physically angry here because I care about people because I have empathy.
[09:15.000 --> 09:24.000]  And when I see young people having heart attacks and dying and strokes and now I'm in wheelchairs and I know they're targeting my children with peer pressure to take this stuff.
[09:24.000 --> 09:29.000]  It makes me at a cellular level extremely angry.
[09:29.000 --> 09:37.000]  And I'm trying and praying every day that God can help me with this, but it's getting to the point where I have trouble doing the show.
[09:37.000 --> 09:42.000]  And I understand ignorance is bliss. Well, I'm not living in ignorance and I'm getting pissed.
[09:42.000 --> 09:47.000]  And you know what? That's natural, but I'm going to put my energy into taking action.
[09:47.000 --> 09:53.000]  There's a big march coming up tomorrow in Houston. I'm going to try to make it. I think Owen's going.
[09:53.000 --> 10:02.000]  But we should get that lady to pop back in at least for 10 minutes today so people know about her event, that nurse that got fired along with 180-something other ones because they wouldn't take the deadly injection.
[10:02.000 --> 10:09.000]  I mean, this is experimental. This is dangerous. It says it can make you have a damn heart attack or a freaking stroke.
[10:09.000 --> 10:19.000]  And you're fired if you don't want to take it.
[10:19.000 --> 10:27.000]  It's incredible. So we've got, that's just one article.
[10:27.000 --> 10:34.000]  Talk a whole show about that, couldn't we? The ramifications of that, an experimental injection, but it wasn't experimental.
[10:34.000 --> 10:42.000]  They'd studied it all over the world on animals and humans, and they knew that if you made a vaccine to attack the spike protein on a virus, the delivery system,
[10:42.000 --> 10:47.000]  that that spike protein is made up of the same stuff we're made up of and would make us attack our bodies.
[10:47.000 --> 10:57.000]  And then you see the head bioethicist in the U.S. on TV saying we're going to give you injections that make you allergic to red meat.
[10:57.000 --> 11:08.000]  And the globalist said, son, we ain't doing that. We're going to give them a shot, make some allergic to themselves.
[11:08.000 --> 11:15.000]  They did it. And here's why I'm so upset.
[11:15.000 --> 11:25.000]  You know Snowden's come out who is a good person and really had a lot of courage and is not an insider that leaked stuff because he's still part of the system.
[11:25.000 --> 11:29.000]  He's for real, just like Julian Assange, just like many others.
[11:29.000 --> 11:34.000]  And he said that look for Assange to be killed next after McAfee.
[11:34.000 --> 11:39.000]  McAfee, of course, was killed and his lawyer says he was not suicidal.
[11:39.000 --> 11:43.000]  Hell, he said on Twitter he never committed suicide just a week ago.
[11:43.000 --> 11:50.000]  And so that's physically why I started crying in the third hour yesterday.
[11:50.000 --> 12:05.000]  Well, I had that guest in here talking about self-defense and coming together because that was just my endorphins being released and my brain soothing me because I can consciously handle death and I'm ready to die.
[12:05.000 --> 12:07.000]  But I've made these decisions now.
[12:07.000 --> 12:13.000]  I mean, I don't like to say things that haven't come true, but they're very close to killing me, folks. Very close.
[12:13.000 --> 12:17.000]  They're very close to going up Tucker Carlson. They're very close to trying to kill Trump.
[12:17.000 --> 12:23.000]  And I don't say that to be dramatic. We need to know the zone we're in.
[12:23.000 --> 12:31.000]  And this is my lane. I asked to be in this lane. I am extremely honored and it feels really good.
[12:31.000 --> 12:43.000]  But the crying is just the emotion of it all becoming true and all being real and how epic it all is on a planet in space and all this incredible stuff happening.
[12:43.000 --> 12:47.000]  And our average human friends are asleep and don't even know what's happening.
[12:47.000 --> 12:55.000]  And then I've got all these videos of Democrats that are in all white clubs that Hispanics, blacks and Asians aren't allowed in.
[12:55.000 --> 12:59.000]  And I'm for free association. If you want to have your own racist club, you can do it.
[12:59.000 --> 13:06.000]  But it doesn't mean you can then lecture us how we're all racist when we're not and you are.
[13:06.000 --> 13:14.000]  It's just the overwhelmingness of the fraud of these people.
[13:14.000 --> 13:18.000]  And I like John McAfee. I thought he was a cool guy.
[13:18.000 --> 13:21.000]  You know, I like Joe Rogan. He's a cool guy in person.
[13:21.000 --> 13:28.000]  You know, one of the boys hanging out with him. You feel cool. You feel fine talking to their celebrity. It's just they have that energy.
[13:28.000 --> 13:32.000]  And you know, they went in there and tortured him first for the killing. And that's me next.
[13:32.000 --> 13:36.000]  So I got a lot of empathy for him and I'm pissed off. You understand that?
[13:36.000 --> 13:40.000]  But here's the thing. I'm going to try to take Gandhi's example.
[13:40.000 --> 13:45.000]  He took his from Christ or Martin Luther King's and I realized they want to trick us into violence right now.
[13:45.000 --> 13:46.000]  So I'm not going to do it.
[13:46.000 --> 13:51.000]  But I'm going to fight them in the information war as hard as I damn can.
[13:51.000 --> 13:59.000]  And in the end, when we take this country and plant it back, they are going to pay legally and lawfully for what they've done.
[13:59.000 --> 14:03.000]  And I just want to make sure we beat them as quick as we can.
[14:03.000 --> 14:05.000]  All right, let me hit the big news.
[14:05.000 --> 14:13.000]  Oh, boy, General Flynn has come out and rightfully said that they're going to stage massive false flags.
[14:13.000 --> 14:16.000]  That's just what comes after 1112 on a clock.
[14:16.000 --> 14:21.000]  What comes after five, six on a clock? It's a no brainer. It's absolutely true.
[14:21.000 --> 14:24.000]  It's going to happen unless we expose it.
[14:24.000 --> 14:26.000]  The question is, how do you expose it?
[14:26.000 --> 14:30.000]  I mean, the clock is racing down here.
[14:30.000 --> 14:32.000]  We're going to play that when we come back.
[14:32.000 --> 14:33.000]  Right out of break.
[14:33.000 --> 14:35.000]  Tim, yesterday, issue an emergency warning.
[14:35.000 --> 14:38.000]  It's on infowars.com, a full hour interview.
[14:38.000 --> 14:40.000]  I suggest you share it.
[14:40.000 --> 14:42.000]  And I'm going to just leave it at that.
[14:42.000 --> 14:43.000]  People say, well, why is it full on your show?
[14:43.000 --> 14:44.000]  Well, you heard him endorse the show.
[14:44.000 --> 14:46.000]  I've met with him. It's great.
[14:46.000 --> 14:47.000]  He's got a plan.
[14:47.000 --> 14:51.000]  I'm not going to say what he's up to, but we're going to be doing some stuff together in the near future.
[14:51.000 --> 14:54.000]  And I'm working with him and I agree with his plans.
[14:54.000 --> 14:58.000]  They're just right with mine because we sit there and finish each other's sentences.
[14:58.000 --> 15:00.000]  We're in this. We're immersed in this.
[15:00.000 --> 15:02.000]  We've got knowledge.
[15:02.000 --> 15:08.000]  And so we're sympatico because we're singing off the same sheet of music that's called reality.
[15:08.000 --> 15:10.000]  And you live in the real world, you know what's coming next.
[15:10.000 --> 15:12.000]  And so they want to kill Flynn.
[15:12.000 --> 15:15.000]  You can make your damn sure that we're all targets.
[15:15.000 --> 15:18.000]  And none of us are suicidal and none of us are going to kill ourselves.
[15:18.000 --> 15:19.000]  We love life.
[15:19.000 --> 15:20.000]  I love life.
[15:20.000 --> 15:21.000]  Flynn loves life.
[15:21.000 --> 15:23.000]  Tucker Carlson loves life.
[15:23.000 --> 15:24.000]  Julian Assange loves life.
[15:24.000 --> 15:27.000]  And Julian Assange is a damn hero.
[15:27.000 --> 15:35.000]  And it is a black mark on Trump that he didn't do anything for Assange when he told Assange to leak that information.
[15:35.000 --> 15:37.000]  People go, how do you know that?
[15:37.000 --> 15:38.000]  He said it on TV.
[15:38.000 --> 15:40.000]  He said Assange leaked release it.
[15:40.000 --> 15:43.000]  A week later, Assange released it.
[15:43.000 --> 15:45.000]  And I'm out here to just bash Trump all day.
[15:45.000 --> 15:46.000]  I'm glad Trump's at the fight.
[15:46.000 --> 15:47.000]  We need him.
[15:47.000 --> 15:51.000]  It's just that now is the time to not leave our people behind, ladies and gentlemen.
[15:51.000 --> 16:02.000]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we'll be right back on the other side with General Flynn's emergency warning.
[16:02.000 --> 16:09.000]  Your voice counts when you share information, be it over the Internet or in person, it changes the world.
[16:09.000 --> 16:12.000]  The globalists know their agenda is unpopular.
[16:12.000 --> 16:13.000]  They know you're angry.
[16:13.000 --> 16:19.000]  And now to get around big tech, it's more important than ever that we use every tool we've got.
[16:19.000 --> 16:26.000]  Well, ladies and gentlemen, if you sign up for our free news and show alerts, you can then take those alerts, those articles and those live feeds,

[16:59.000 --> 17:03.000]  I don't like coming to you and saying this could be our last broadcast.
[17:03.000 --> 17:07.000]  Hell, I've been on there 27 years, and only the last year or so have I said that.
[17:07.000 --> 17:10.000]  But let me tell you, the new world orders breathe them down our neck.
[17:10.000 --> 17:15.000]  The big globalist publications are coming after us, and they're doing everything they can to shut us down.
[17:15.000 --> 17:20.000]  So please pray to keep InfoWars on the air, and please support the local states you're listening to as well.
[17:20.000 --> 17:27.000]  At the same time, go to infowarstore.com while you still can, and get a book, get a film, get a t-shirt.
[17:27.000 --> 17:33.000]  Get some supplements, because it's that money that helps us stay on air in the face of this thing.
[17:33.000 --> 17:35.000]  I need your help more than ever now.
[17:35.000 --> 17:39.000]  I want to keep fighting the globalists, but I can't do it if you don't support us.
[17:39.000 --> 17:44.000]  So pray for us, word of mouth, tell folks about the broadcast however you can,
[17:44.000 --> 17:50.000]  and buy great products that will enrich you and your family's lives every day at infowarstore.com.
[17:50.000 --> 17:55.000]  Whether it's high quality coffee, for supplements, or books or films, all of it nurtures the soul,
[17:55.000 --> 17:59.000]  all of it empowers humanity, all of it is pro-human and pro-God.
[17:59.000 --> 18:01.000]  Thank you so much.
[18:01.000 --> 18:04.000]  The equation is very simple.
[18:04.000 --> 18:10.000]  The bank of banks control the media, they control big pharma, they control academia,
[18:10.000 --> 18:14.000]  they control the military, industrial complex, they control big tech,
[18:14.000 --> 18:23.000]  and everywhere that they have been in control in the third world, they have established absolute total despotism and dehumanization.
[18:23.000 --> 18:30.000]  It is the western Christian idea of human freedom that ended slavery and that promoted women's rights
[18:30.000 --> 18:32.000]  and so much more that actually threatens them.
[18:32.000 --> 18:38.000]  So because they can't defeat that empowering ethic, they instead co-opt it, turn it upside down,
[18:38.000 --> 18:47.000]  and use the idea of equality to actually destroy human freedom and the free market that threatens their monopoly and control.
[18:47.000 --> 18:53.000]  That's why they target info wars because we understand the keys to defeating them.
[18:53.000 --> 18:58.000]  The only way our transmission gets out is if you promote info wars and ban that video.
[18:58.000 --> 19:21.000]  So redouble your efforts for all of this together.
[19:28.000 --> 19:35.000]  Welcome back to The Alex Jones Show on this live Friday, June 25th transmission.
[19:35.000 --> 19:40.000]  We've got another special Saturday transmission coming up for you that will air 4 p.m.
[19:40.000 --> 19:43.000]  Central tomorrow with some big guests, not just Ted Nugent who's huge,
[19:43.000 --> 19:47.000]  but we're working on some really big guests that are up to the boat, we want to get them in the boat first.
[19:47.000 --> 19:50.000]  Big breaking news tomorrow.
[19:50.000 --> 19:52.000]  I'm just going to leave it at that.
[19:52.000 --> 19:56.000]  Now let's get back to the big issue at hand.
[19:56.000 --> 19:59.000]  This is on infowars.com.
[19:59.000 --> 20:08.000]  Warning America, General Flynn says globalist will pull something big before the Arizona audit goes public.
[20:08.000 --> 20:18.000]  And he says not UFOs, and I agree with him, not, you know, a nuclear war, but blowing up a church, shooting up a black church.
[20:18.000 --> 20:20.000]  That's what all the pre-programming is.
[20:20.000 --> 20:22.000]  The white supremacists are everywhere.
[20:22.000 --> 20:27.000]  They kill black people and it's all Trump supporters' faults and all people that question the election.
[20:27.000 --> 20:33.000]  And you're like, why is this on every channel, every news show, every Democrat politician is just everywhere like a parent.
[20:33.000 --> 20:34.000]  White supremacists are going to attack.
[20:34.000 --> 20:36.000]  White supremacists are going to kill everybody.
[20:36.000 --> 20:40.000]  I mean, as somebody said, somebody's going to burn your house down for a couple months.
[20:40.000 --> 20:44.000]  When your house burns down, who would you think burned the house down?
[20:44.000 --> 20:48.000]  The person that kept telling you that your house was going to get burned down.
[20:48.000 --> 20:51.000]  They talk to you like you're idiots.
[20:51.000 --> 20:57.000]  It's like when they're rolling out a new Mustang, they have ads for it or a new flavor of Coke, they have months of ads for it.
[20:57.000 --> 21:03.000]  Well, they're rolling out that white supremacists are everywhere and they're going to kill everybody and need to be put in the FEMA camps
[21:03.000 --> 21:11.000]  and that the CIA needs to arrest members of Congress because they're planning a giant overthrow and we're going to kill everybody.
[21:11.000 --> 21:16.000]  With zero evidence or anything of it, they're not doing that for no reason.
[21:16.000 --> 21:19.000]  They're going to stage something.
[21:19.000 --> 21:24.000]  And the Arizona audit, they're debating whether it's going to be out in two weeks or months.
[21:24.000 --> 21:26.000]  Massive evidence has come out so much every day.
[21:26.000 --> 21:31.000]  I can spend the whole show on what they found in Michigan and Arizona and Georgia.
[21:31.000 --> 21:36.000]  And that's why the Justice Department run by Mr. Garland has now sued Georgia today.
[21:36.000 --> 21:43.000]  As soon as they couldn't get their federal takeover of elections that violate the Constitution, total federalization,
[21:43.000 --> 21:55.000]  as soon as that fraud didn't pass, he comes out of his little snake hole and says we're taking over the Georgia system, we've sued.
[21:55.000 --> 22:02.000]  But their lawsuit wants to federalize it state by state now so they can have people vote curbside with no IDs,
[22:02.000 --> 22:06.000]  so no signatures needed on a mail-in ballot, fraud.
[22:06.000 --> 22:10.000]  They've got all these illegal aliens voting, dead people voting, it's on record.
[22:10.000 --> 22:15.000]  They've now confirmed Georgia was double counting ballots that night.
[22:15.000 --> 22:18.000]  We could watch the video back when we got it, but now it's confirmed.
[22:18.000 --> 22:25.000]  Now the Republican leaders that have denied it in Georgia are now having to admit it.
[22:25.000 --> 22:28.000]  So what are they going to do?
[22:28.000 --> 22:38.000]  They're going to attack a minority church or college or grocery store, some type of minority gathering.
[22:38.000 --> 22:45.000]  And they're either going to completely false flag and do it 100% themselves or they're going to find mentally ill, in-cell, white supremacist types.
[22:45.000 --> 22:50.000]  There will really be devil worshipers whacked out of their minds on prescription and illegal drugs.
[22:50.000 --> 22:55.000]  It will be a two or three-man idiot squad that will go in and start shooting black people in a church.
[22:55.000 --> 23:05.000]  Then there will be a backup team that will kill them claiming they committed suicide who will then actually kill a couple hundred black people.
[23:05.000 --> 23:09.000]  Because the Satanists always start shooting people and they kind of, wow, I'm actually killing somebody.
[23:09.000 --> 23:11.000]  This isn't as cool as I thought.
[23:11.000 --> 23:15.000]  And then they get killed by the black op team, the black op team, then kills the lion's share of the people.
[23:15.000 --> 23:19.000]  They're going to want a big number, hundreds of dead black children.
[23:19.000 --> 23:28.000]  So if you go to a black church or you go to a rural, say, black grocery store, you better be packing.
[23:28.000 --> 23:32.000]  You better be watching, because let me tell you, the deep states are coming.
[23:32.000 --> 23:37.000]  Here's General Flynn, former head of defense intelligence, former national security advisor, and the president giving the same warning.
[23:37.000 --> 23:42.000]  And do you think it's going to be, God forbid, some sort of a 9-11 event,
[23:42.000 --> 23:49.000]  or are they going to just hang their hat on the UFO noise that we now are seeing in mass reporting by mainstream media?
[23:49.000 --> 23:53.000]  Nonetheless, they're now talking about UFOs and zombie apocalypses.
[23:53.000 --> 23:56.000]  Actually, they reported about zombie apocalypses.
[23:56.000 --> 23:59.000]  Which city might have the biggest zombie apocalypse?
[23:59.000 --> 24:02.000]  And that was actually New York City, by the way, for those of you in New York.
[24:02.000 --> 24:04.000]  Sorry to say you might get eaten by a zombie.
[24:04.000 --> 24:10.000]  So, I mean, do you have any feeling whether it's going to be a 9-11 type event,
[24:10.000 --> 24:14.000]  or is it just going to be some noise like UFOs, which have been around forever?
[24:14.000 --> 24:19.000]  Yeah, no. I mean, there is going to be something that's going to happen.
[24:19.000 --> 24:24.000]  And I'm afraid that what it's going to do is it's going to further divide the country.
[24:24.000 --> 24:32.000]  I mean, it's not going to be as dramatic as something that you're talking about with 9-11.
[24:32.000 --> 24:40.000]  And the stupidity of this nonsense of UFOs and this apocalyptic crap is just such garbage.
[24:40.000 --> 24:44.000]  People need to face reality. We need to face reality.
[24:44.000 --> 24:47.000]  They are going to continue to go after Donald Trump.
[24:47.000 --> 24:50.000]  They're going to continue to go after Donald Trump.
[24:50.000 --> 24:54.000]  And I'm glad to see the president finally getting out and doing rallies.
[24:54.000 --> 24:58.000]  He's going to be doing one in Sarasota here in the 4th of July.
[24:58.000 --> 25:02.000]  I think he's going to be up in Ohio, you know, Saturday.
[25:02.000 --> 25:06.000]  So, he's going to get back out and he needs to light the world on fire,
[25:06.000 --> 25:11.000]  because I know that they are going to go after him.
[25:11.000 --> 25:15.000]  And whenever they go after him, it's never pretty.
[25:15.000 --> 25:20.000]  It's going to be ugly and that creates a lot of media attraction.
[25:20.000 --> 25:24.000]  Everybody has to cover it. What does it mean? What is it going to do?
[25:24.000 --> 25:28.000]  And it keeps everybody off of the election fraud.
[25:28.000 --> 25:32.000]  As I said at the beginning of this show, you know, repeat after me.
[25:32.000 --> 25:36.000]  The 2020 presidential election was stolen.
[25:36.000 --> 25:40.000]  There's no doubt in my mind anymore. There's none.
[25:40.000 --> 25:45.000]  And there's too much evidence that has come to the top and the truth will continue to come out.
[25:45.000 --> 25:50.000]  So, if something is going to happen, I don't think we're going to have to wait until the end of the summer.
[25:50.000 --> 25:55.000]  I think it's going to happen here fairly soon, because they do not want...
[25:55.000 --> 26:03.000]  In fact, they must create noise prior to the Arizona audit starting to really bubble out.
[26:03.000 --> 26:06.000]  They're going to have to do something.
[26:06.000 --> 26:10.000]  Well, that's right. So, warning America.
[26:10.000 --> 26:13.000]  General Flynn says globalists will pull something big before AZ audit.
[26:13.000 --> 26:15.000]  That's public. That is, I agree.
[26:15.000 --> 26:22.000]  One of the top issues we're facing, if not the top issue, because all the preparation, all the demonization,
[26:22.000 --> 26:29.000]  all the prescripting that this white supremacist army, this phantom menace, is going to be doing all of this.
[26:29.000 --> 26:31.000]  So, we're going to go to break in a few minutes.
[26:31.000 --> 26:42.000]  I'm going to come back and I'm going to shift gears into that entire area and look at why they're promoting black on white crime
[26:42.000 --> 26:47.000]  while then hyping up white on black crime that is almost non-existent.
[26:47.000 --> 26:50.000]  What is the larger issue behind that, and how do we expose that?
[26:50.000 --> 26:57.000]  Then we've got the huge developments, massive heart attack strokes, not quote rare, as they said, but extremely common.
[26:57.000 --> 27:02.000]  In old, middle-aged, young, black, white, doesn't matter. It's super deadly.
[27:02.000 --> 27:04.000]  We've got all of that news.
[27:04.000 --> 27:09.000]  We also have some really important information dealing with the economy.
[27:09.000 --> 27:12.000]  And, of course, this came out yesterday, but I wanted to learn more about it.
[27:12.000 --> 27:18.000]  I've had a chance to read the Supreme Court of New York's disbarment of Rudolf Giuliani.
[27:18.000 --> 27:22.000]  And they just say with no proof, you question an election, that's not allowed in America.
[27:22.000 --> 27:28.000]  They actually say that. So this is just outrageous behavior by the New York Supreme Court,
[27:28.000 --> 27:35.000]  and it shows the judiciary is in the pocket of the globalist, and it's gone full weaponization against humanity.
[27:35.000 --> 27:38.000]  So there that is right there. It's all coming up.
[27:38.000 --> 27:43.000]  Remember, this is not a spectator sport. This is Toto Toto of the New World Order.
[27:43.000 --> 27:50.000]  So please, however you're listening on radio or TV or at infowars.com, share those links with everyone you know and tell them to share it.
[27:50.000 --> 27:56.000]  That's how we trigger the same reaction. That's how we defeat the globalists. Stay with us.
[27:59.000 --> 28:09.000]  As men age, they often experience a slowdown in vitality, energy, and overall wellness.
[28:09.000 --> 28:14.000]  And that's why we made one of our most popular formulas to date.
[28:14.000 --> 28:25.000]  Super male vitality, specifically designed to assist the body in regulating proper balance to create superior vitality in males.

[29:54.000 --> 29:59.000]  The fourth of July super sales starts now at infowarstore.com.
[29:59.000 --> 30:07.000]  Humanity has been domesticated by and large. The population has been trained to submit, do what you're told, and it's all going to pass.
[30:07.000 --> 30:16.000]  But if you study authoritarians, if you study the globalists, you understand that they reach a point where all the training is just beta and you go into the point of being cold, being totally enslaved.
[30:16.000 --> 30:21.000]  And because the globalists see us as weak and see us as stupid, they are now making that move.
[30:21.000 --> 30:32.000]  And they are collapsing the third world with their economic weapons to then flood us with the third world that the UN will use as a weapon to then have us under such a crisis, under such a load,
[30:32.000 --> 30:39.000]  capitulate to the UN whatever agreements they want us to sign, hoping that they will stop the flood of tens of millions of refugees,
[30:39.000 --> 30:55.000]  not fleeing COVID or climate change, as the UN and Klaus Schwabber and Bill Gates are saying, but fleeing the year-long lockdowns that the UN and Bill Gates ordered them to institute or they wouldn't get more IMF and World Bank money.
[30:55.000 --> 31:10.000]  And that's why we have to really get educated about the globalist.
[31:10.000 --> 31:30.000]  The clown in chief who stole his way into the White House is disintegrating in front of all of our eyes.
[31:30.000 --> 31:45.000]  I got the $1.9 trillion relief so far. I wrote the bill. I wrote the bill.
[31:45.000 --> 32:00.000]  I wrote the bill. I wrote the bill. I wrote the bill.
[32:00.000 --> 32:20.000]  On the environment. What's happening? Thank you for listening.
[32:20.000 --> 32:37.000]  Is Joe Biden really a racist? I'm going to hate with my view on this. No. He's an anti-human. Joe Biden hates everybody but himself. Joe Biden is a psychotic sociopathic control freak who lies to everyone.
[32:37.000 --> 32:52.000]  And yeah, were there old alliances of elitist white people that didn't want you in their country club if you weren't related to them? Snobbed the white people as well as black people or anybody else? Absolutely.
[32:52.000 --> 33:00.000]  And Joe Biden belonged to those all-white clubs until the 90s. And he defended those.
[33:00.000 --> 33:11.000]  Now look, you're allowed to have your own all-black club, all-Asian club. Hell, you have fraternal clubs that are all Polish or all-German or all-Japanese or all-Mexican. That's fine.
[33:11.000 --> 33:21.000]  But it's not like, oh, this is our Italian culture center or the Jewish center. This is the only white people period by invitation to be part of this club.
[33:21.000 --> 33:29.000]  And those clubs are all about saying we're the elite better than everybody. And you have a right to do that.
[33:29.000 --> 33:40.000]  I have a right to say you're a fraud, especially when I have no desire to be any part of a club that would have me to quote Groucho Marx.
[33:40.000 --> 33:53.000]  But the fact is, is these guys are part of a globalist club that see everyone else as a commodity and everyone else as worthless and everyone else could be abused and fed off of.
[33:53.000 --> 34:06.000]  And they've got their own cloistered separate clubs from us because they want to be able to suck us dry and make us poor and dumb us down and not even look at us while they live on all of our stolen energy.
[34:06.000 --> 34:14.000]  Whereas I want to see everybody successful and empowered through competition. These guys want monopoly systems.
[34:14.000 --> 34:25.000]  And so, yeah, he's super creepy. Let's actually play the non-edited, non-joke one. Let's actually play the whispering club from him yesterday just with no editing.
[34:25.000 --> 34:35.000]  So you get an idea of the serious cognitive freak show decline of this guy that doesn't know what planet he's on. Here it is.
[34:35.000 --> 34:44.000]  I got them $1.9 trillion relief so far. They're going to be getting checks in the mail that are consequential.
[34:44.000 --> 34:52.000]  I wrote the bill on the environment. Pay them more.
[34:52.000 --> 35:01.000]  This is an employee's bargaining chip now. What's happening?
[35:01.000 --> 35:08.000]  I want to explain something to black people or anybody else that has never lived around a country club, something about country club folks.
[35:08.000 --> 35:12.000]  A lot of them are really nice people who like to play golf, like to play tennis.
[35:12.000 --> 35:17.000]  Whether it's an elitist country club or whether it's just a blue collar country club, they got those.
[35:17.000 --> 35:21.000]  I grew up on a kind of a mid-level, middle-class country club.
[35:21.000 --> 35:26.000]  And I would routinely have old men drive up on a golf cart when I'd be walking down the street and ask, are you part of the club?
[35:26.000 --> 35:31.000]  Do you live around here? And they just do it to act official and powerful. And you better believe they're black.
[35:31.000 --> 35:33.000]  They're going to come over and ask why you're here as well.
[35:33.000 --> 35:36.000]  But that goes on to everybody. I live on a golf course.
[35:36.000 --> 35:40.000]  And everybody walks on the golf course about nine in the morning when the golfers get out there.
[35:40.000 --> 35:47.000]  And I've probably had 20 times over the years, old ladies see me walking along with one of my kids and ask, do you live around here?
[35:47.000 --> 35:50.000]  And I'm always polite. And I say, yeah, sure. Do you live around here?
[35:50.000 --> 35:52.000]  Well, I just wanted to make sure you lived around here.
[35:52.000 --> 35:56.000]  Oh, because how would you like it if I asked you that?
[35:56.000 --> 36:01.000]  Oh, you wouldn't like that. See, you're in a position of the elitist and you're the boss.
[36:01.000 --> 36:05.000]  And so you're at, see, where do you live?
[36:05.000 --> 36:08.000]  Well, they'll start stuttering. I live at this place. Exactly.
[36:08.000 --> 36:14.000]  So you're on a power trip and I'm not sneaking around your backyard.
[36:14.000 --> 36:18.000]  I'm here with my three-year-old walking over here to the creek.
[36:18.000 --> 36:25.000]  God forbid you got fishing poles over your shoulder because to these mummies that live in high-rise buildings or on these golf courses,
[36:25.000 --> 36:30.000]  it's weird to go fishing in a creek.
[36:30.000 --> 36:35.000]  And that's why when they walk around the golf course, they wear like polo shirts and, you know, even in hot weather,
[36:35.000 --> 36:40.000]  these like thirst and howl the third outfits or stuff from Bushwood in Caddyshack.
[36:40.000 --> 36:43.000]  I grew up in a Caddyshack neighborhood.
[36:43.000 --> 36:47.000]  I actually grew up basically at a place just like Bushwood.
[36:47.000 --> 36:50.000]  And I got to actually see how the world worked because you see all the different stratus.
[36:50.000 --> 36:55.000]  You got the guys gambling behind the Greenskeeper shop.
[36:55.000 --> 37:00.000]  You got, I mean, literally the exact, that crazy Vietnam vets want to blow up the gopers with explosives.
[37:00.000 --> 37:05.000]  I mean, I think that must have gone at every golf course because that was actually going on.
[37:05.000 --> 37:10.000]  So you've got to get it. It's not black against white. It's elitist against everybody else.
[37:10.000 --> 37:13.000]  And Donald Trump's the guy that bought all these clubs and opened them up to everybody.
[37:13.000 --> 37:17.000]  He's like, hey, let's have a party. And they're the ones that didn't.
[37:17.000 --> 37:21.000]  So if you don't understand their mindset, they're not taking these deadly vaccines.
[37:21.000 --> 37:24.000]  They're not doing this. No, they want you to take them. They want to dominate you.
[37:24.000 --> 37:27.000]  So this, this came out a few days ago. I was in New York in that time to cover it.
[37:27.000 --> 37:33.000]  I want to cover it now because imagine if Donald Trump was in an all white club.
[37:33.000 --> 37:38.000]  No, no, he actually opened up the all white clubs, bought them up when they were failing and opened them up to everybody.
[37:38.000 --> 37:43.000]  Dimson White House Defense Families Membership in all white club.
[37:43.000 --> 37:49.000]  It's a long tradition in Rhode Island. Oh, like the KKK.
[37:49.000 --> 37:54.000]  So again, this is the big Democrat that lectures us how all whites are racist and America's bad.
[37:54.000 --> 38:00.000]  And the military needs to tell white troops they're bad and create this, this, this racism system.
[38:00.000 --> 38:06.000]  But then he's in an all white club in Rhode Island that's famous and racist.
[38:06.000 --> 38:12.000]  And then Joe Biden's exact same way in speeches saying black people are cockroaches.
[38:12.000 --> 38:19.000]  But that's okay because he's a Democrat. And it's okay if Tim Cook runs death camps for Apple because he's gay.
[38:19.000 --> 38:24.000]  I mean, literally, it's like, oh, you're a Democrat. Oh, you're gay. Oh, then it's okay if you're a pedophile.
[38:24.000 --> 38:30.000]  So here he is, Senator Sheldon White House who betrays himself as a progressive social justice wear.
[38:30.000 --> 38:36.000]  But see, the mainstream media won't ask if you imagine if I was in an all white club.
[38:36.000 --> 38:47.000]  Can you imagine what they would say and do but oh, no, oh, no, I don't want to be in an all white club. They do.
[38:47.000 --> 38:52.000]  I want to be an all patriot club. How about that? I want to be in a club where Democrats don't like it. Don't join.
[38:52.000 --> 38:58.000]  How about that? How about I'm in the American club. How about that club, the club, you know, of free speech and guns and family
[38:58.000 --> 39:05.000]  and fast cars and lots of wealth and power and success and Jesus Christ, the center of it. That's why we got all that power.
[39:05.000 --> 39:09.000]  Here's this piece of crap. Here he is.
[39:09.000 --> 39:16.000]  A little close. Okay. Back in 2017, you had expressed concerns about the membership of the all white daily speech club.
[39:16.000 --> 39:22.000]  Said that you hoped it would become more diverse. Now, your family's been members. Your wife is one of the largest shareholders.
[39:22.000 --> 39:26.000]  Has there been any traction in that? Are there any minority members of the club now?
[39:26.000 --> 39:31.000]  I think the people who are running the place are still working on that. I'm sorry it hasn't happened yet.
[39:31.000 --> 39:36.000]  Some of the concerns in 2021, I mean, obviously it's been four years. You had remarks on the floor,
[39:36.000 --> 39:43.000]  following the deaths of Breonna Taylor and George Floyd saying, you know, hoping to root out systemic racism in the country.
[39:43.000 --> 39:49.000]  Your thoughts on an elite, all white, wealthy club again in this day and age.
[39:49.000 --> 39:52.000]  You know, should these clubs continue to exist?
[39:52.000 --> 39:56.000]  It's a long tradition in Rhode Island and there are many of them.
[39:56.000 --> 40:00.000]  We just need to work our way through the issues. Thank you.
[40:00.000 --> 40:07.000]  So he and his dirtbag wife are part of a literal KKK club, but he's going to divide us on race and tell us we're all bad to fight with each other,
[40:07.000 --> 40:13.000]  which is exactly what the KKK does. So, Jim, Senator Whitehouse, burn in hell.
[40:13.000 --> 40:19.000]  Burn in hell. I hate you. How dare you spill your racism? How dare you spill your division?
[40:19.000 --> 40:24.000]  How dare you sell us out to China? How dare all of you leftist do this?
[40:24.000 --> 40:28.000]  Lock us down. Tell us we're not essential. Sit there and teach us.
[40:28.000 --> 40:36.000]  And then cut the police. So crime explodes and all the other criminal activities you engage in.
[40:36.000 --> 40:39.000]  What a slimy. He's so arrogant. He's so conceited.
[40:39.000 --> 40:46.000]  He's so, might be the feminine. He's just this soft dough boy laughing at everyone because he's the elitist.
[40:46.000 --> 40:50.000]  He's part of the club. He's going to screw you over. It's a long tradition.
[40:50.000 --> 40:54.000]  He's the KKK teaching you how to be racist using race to control you.
[40:54.000 --> 40:57.000]  Burn in hell, Whitehouse. Burn.

[43:57.960 --> 44:03.720]  The scientific dictatorship that I've been warning you about for 27 years has now gone
[44:03.720 --> 44:09.880]  from beta testing to operational. The globalists are out in the open with their planetary depopulation
[44:09.880 --> 44:14.960]  takeover, their robot takeover but the good news is we've been working and you've been working and
[44:14.960 --> 44:18.960]  others have been working across the planet for decades to get ready for this, to be able to
[44:18.960 --> 44:24.240]  find it off. Humanity is strong, we're incredible and if we're aware of the attack that's happening
[44:24.240 --> 44:29.040]  we have a real chance of defeating it. If we ask God for guidance we will defeat it. So prayer is
[44:29.040 --> 44:34.000]  essential, research is essential, getting prepared is essential and warning others is absolutely
[44:34.000 --> 44:39.040]  essential and at the same time supporting info wars by buying high-quality products to keep us
[44:39.040 --> 44:43.520]  on air is essential because they're great products for you and your family and they're also funding

[44:54.640 --> 44:58.720]  so get them today at infowarstore.com and I thank you for being part of the resistance.
[44:58.720 --> 45:11.760]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[45:28.720 --> 45:57.760]  I'm elementary, I'm psychist queen. I am perpetual, I keep the constant.
[45:59.120 --> 46:10.000]  All right, let me just finish up with this piece of crap and then I'm done. I'm going to move on
[46:10.000 --> 46:16.320]  the other big news and special guests in studio and all the key information. My frustration is
[46:16.320 --> 46:24.160]  if you want to have your own racial club or your own group, have at it. In fact if you're proud of
[46:24.160 --> 46:30.320]  your group and say we're into Celtic tradition and if you've got Celtic bloodline background,
[46:30.320 --> 46:34.960]  we want you to be part of an organization or we're an African group that's all about African
[46:34.960 --> 46:39.040]  culture. If you're part of an African culture, come. It's not that you hate other people,
[46:39.040 --> 46:44.160]  it's that you're proud of your culture. I'm 100% for that but these weird east coasts,
[46:45.360 --> 46:51.280]  that's what they mainly have them, clubs where it's because your white is the reason
[46:51.280 --> 46:56.880]  and then everybody else is excluded. You're allowed to have that club in America
[46:57.680 --> 47:03.760]  but I'm allowed to say you're an elitist and then I'm really allowed to say I hate your gods
[47:03.760 --> 47:08.640]  when you run around sowing racial division and telling five-year-olds, I'm sorry,
[47:08.640 --> 47:13.680]  now it turns out the feds are funding it in preschool. Three-year-old white children are
[47:13.680 --> 47:19.040]  being told they're bad because they're white by these racist freakazoids that want to create
[47:19.040 --> 47:23.360]  division because you know it's going to make white people racist, right? I never grew up
[47:23.360 --> 47:27.200]  seeing racism, didn't hear about it. Now that whites are being told they're racist and they're
[47:27.200 --> 47:31.200]  pieces of crap, a lot of white folks are getting really racist and you know what, I don't blame
[47:31.200 --> 47:36.160]  them because that's tribalism. A lot of black people that have been suppressed become racist
[47:36.160 --> 47:40.000]  because if somebody doesn't reach out to you and explain the bigger picture, that's what you'll do
[47:40.000 --> 47:45.520]  to protect yourself. But the crew pointed this out and this is admitted, I forgot to point it out
[47:45.520 --> 47:54.000]  myself, that this Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, Democrat Rhode Island, who runs around pushing
[47:54.000 --> 48:02.320]  critical race theory and all of it, his wife runs the 200-year-old all-white super racist KKK club.
[48:03.600 --> 48:09.280]  So when he says, oh sorry, the management can't do anything about it, and look at the arrogance
[48:09.280 --> 48:15.040]  and fakeness and disingenuousness of him. When you have discernment, you look at him or Stelter
[48:16.480 --> 48:22.160]  or Tim Cook and you just see a demon. The average person, oh that's a nice gray-haired man to
[48:22.160 --> 48:31.200]  suit. He's a dude that runs a creepy all-white club that's 200 years old that then tells everybody
[48:31.200 --> 48:43.360]  else they're racist. Fuck you, Senator Whitehouse, fuck you. And Northam in KKK outfits and all of it.
[48:43.360 --> 48:50.240]  I mean, that's their race controllers. And back when whites were the majority and they could
[48:50.240 --> 48:54.800]  trick them into being racist, they do it. And now they're trying to make the minorities all
[48:54.800 --> 49:02.240]  racist to control them. It's the oldest trick in the book and it's disgusting. And I personally am
[49:02.240 --> 49:09.920]  sick of it. And you got the Democrats on every channel saying whites are inherently evil and
[49:09.920 --> 49:15.760]  whites are bad, and we have record numbers of innocent white people. White babies, white women,
[49:15.760 --> 49:20.720]  white men grabbed out of their cribs, taken and murdered by black racists because they were white.
[49:20.720 --> 49:26.800]  I never even played that crib footage of the little kid with the baby being grabbed out and
[49:26.800 --> 49:31.280]  taken and raped and murdered in the street because they were white. But the black guy watched,
[49:31.920 --> 49:35.360]  watched those little white kid there, figured out where he lived and wanted to kill a white baby.
[49:36.160 --> 49:40.000]  And when he got arrested by the police, he said white people are racist. Like this black guy
[49:40.000 --> 49:43.520]  that just shot all these people. He said, well, there's all these white racists. I mean, they're
[49:43.520 --> 49:53.840]  Nazis. I'm Captain America. Because Senator Whitehouse gets up on television and says white
[49:53.840 --> 50:02.800]  people are inherently bad. In fact, I forget the little boy's name. He was in Dallas.
[50:05.520 --> 50:09.920]  He had the black racist, crawls through the window, grabs a little kid out of his crib,
[50:09.920 --> 50:13.840]  and then takes him to kill him. And again, I don't blame all black people for that,
[50:13.840 --> 50:22.720]  but I do blame White House. I do blame the media. I do blame Jeff Zucker. I do blame Google.
[50:23.280 --> 50:26.720]  I do blame, I mean, look at that little smart ass face on him.
[50:28.640 --> 50:33.440]  He's got a lot of nerve, doesn't he? He's been like, if I was up here all day telling you that I
[50:33.440 --> 50:37.680]  love everybody, and I believe in Martin Luther King's statement of judging people on the content
[50:37.680 --> 50:43.360]  of their character, which I do, because it makes sense. And then you found out I was in an all
[50:43.360 --> 50:48.560]  white KKK club. You wouldn't have much faith in me, would you? But his constituents, because the
[50:48.560 --> 50:56.800]  media cover it up, do. We need people protesting outside this KKK member's house every damn day.
[50:58.240 --> 51:02.880]  If somebody wants to honestly be a member of the KKK, that's their right. We don't need to protest
[51:02.880 --> 51:07.440]  their house. We got plenty of races on all sides. But when you want to lead us into a race war,
[51:07.440 --> 51:13.360]  when you're a damn member of the KKK, I say you are a special case, and you need to burn in hell.
[51:14.720 --> 51:19.200]  You race bait and son of a goddamn goblin. Excuse me, Lord.
[51:22.320 --> 51:27.920]  Oh, I'm so sick of these people. Gosh, I'm tired of frauds, aren't you?
[51:30.240 --> 51:34.400]  I haven't gotten into all the attacks on white people articles in General Millie. Oh, the white
[51:34.400 --> 51:38.240]  people are evil. And no, he wants to know why we're evil, because we attacked the Capitol,
[51:38.240 --> 51:42.880]  because we're white. No, no, you lured us into that. You were obviously part of it. Out of a
[51:42.880 --> 51:47.040]  million people, you got a few hundred idiots who do what they did, and it was all run by the leftist,
[51:47.040 --> 51:55.200]  and we'll cover it next hour with a witness to it. Yeah, look at this. I mean, he crept in there
[51:55.200 --> 51:59.440]  to grab the little kid out of his room and then take him and torture him and murder him because
[51:59.440 --> 52:06.160]  he was white. You imagine if they try to turn this into George Floyd thing and blame all blacks
[52:06.160 --> 52:11.120]  for what this guy did, that'd be a crime, just like turning what one cop did by accident into all
[52:11.120 --> 52:20.160]  whites that it is a crime. And you've got this mentally ill dude that looks like he's about
[52:20.160 --> 52:25.760]  80% white anyways, going in here to because he was because a demon's in him. A demon's in him
[52:25.760 --> 52:31.440]  wants him to kill a child. Oh, but don't tell General Millie about that or the latest thing.
[52:31.440 --> 52:37.280]  I mean, look at this vampire standing above the crib. And then he finally grabs the little boy,
[52:38.160 --> 52:41.680]  the little baby, and takes him out to kill it. And they found the kid dead in the street.

[56:55.040 --> 57:01.040]  They are discovering the globalist the elites the manipulation the CFR the trilateral commission
[57:01.040 --> 57:08.000]  the Bilderberg group the Bohemian Grove the club of Rome. And so even though it seems like the
[57:08.000 --> 57:14.240]  globalists are winning the truth is they've had to come out the open to attack human freedom
[57:14.240 --> 57:21.040]  because they're actually losing. We have forced them out in the open. So as bad as these times are
[57:21.040 --> 57:25.920]  a lot of negative things are about to happen. Realize humanity is winning. You've got to trust
[57:25.920 --> 57:33.280]  in the plan of God and trust in the plan of God's justice. That is invincible. That is ethereal
[57:33.280 --> 57:39.040]  timeless and unstoppable. So don't trust in man trust in God to lead God and direct your soul
[57:39.040 --> 57:43.440]  and then take action against the globalists and realize you've got my commitment from Alex Jones
[57:43.440 --> 57:52.400]  and my crew to you. We will never back down from the globalist and we will never surrender you're
[57:52.400 --> 58:06.960]  listening to the Alex Jones show ends a thousand maybe hundreds of thousands of mentally ill vagrants
[58:06.960 --> 58:12.080]  wiping their butt on your lawn every day literally and you can't do anything because they have autonomy
[58:12.080 --> 58:17.120]  and you can't tell them what to do but Britney Spears can be prevented from having kids by a
[58:17.120 --> 58:22.320]  conservatorship. I mean it just seems very strange to me. Well the difference Tucker is that Britney
[58:22.320 --> 58:27.920]  Spears had a lot of money and therefore she had a lot of people who were willing to go to court to
[58:27.920 --> 58:34.080]  try to get access and control over that money and that's exactly what they did. She can't decide how
[58:34.080 --> 58:38.720]  to spend anything. Now I've talked to some people here in California. I'm in LA right now. I've
[58:38.720 --> 58:43.920]  talked to some people here who say that the attorney that is the court appointed attorney for her
[58:43.920 --> 58:50.560]  and the judge are very fair and just people. The problem is Britney Spears didn't pick this
[58:50.560 --> 58:56.480]  lawyer. Her lawyer is court appointed. That means the judge picked the lawyer. When she said she
[58:56.480 --> 59:01.920]  wasn't allowed to get her own lawyer she's exactly right because she's not even considered to have
[59:01.920 --> 59:09.840]  the capacity to contract with a lawyer much less be given the money by her father to pay for a lawyer
[59:09.840 --> 59:14.960]  so she can't even choose her own lawyer in a country like this where everyone has a lawyer.
[59:16.480 --> 59:21.360]  I just think it's so it's so strange and worth paying attention to. I remember when they took
[59:21.360 --> 59:25.520]  Alex Jones off all platforms they'll say oh he's Alex Jones he's just crazy you know who cares we're
[59:25.520 --> 59:29.440]  not going to defend Alex Jones and the next thing you know it's like Parler's gone everyone you know
[59:29.440 --> 59:33.920]  has been de-platformed right or Julian Assange they didn't like what he he printed so they threw
[59:33.920 --> 59:38.480]  him in prison oh it's just Julian Assange don't worry we shouldn't worry when an American citizen
[59:38.480 --> 59:43.840]  when an individual is treated like this I think so I am really glad that you explained that for
[59:43.840 --> 59:50.080]  us tonight. Francie Hicks thank you. Rose McGowan thanks so much for coming on tonight. Hi Tucker
[59:50.080 --> 59:57.680]  nice to meet you too I also have an open mind. Well this is my favorite quality in a person
[59:57.680 --> 1:00:05.280]  thank you. So I'm coming at this cold I again haven't seen Britney Spears since 2003 I just
[1:00:05.280 --> 1:00:11.520]  read she's been in her conservatorship. Make the case if you would what is it and why is that
[1:00:11.520 --> 1:00:20.320]  bad or good. Well in my opinion and in many others it's bad imagine you're a 25 year old young woman
[1:00:20.320 --> 1:00:28.640]  or young human who has been forced to perform since as long as she could walk to support her family
[1:00:28.640 --> 1:00:35.760]  her father put her under conservatorship at age 25 many in the media laughed and scorned her when
[1:00:35.760 --> 1:00:42.320]  she shaved her head. I lived in Hollywood during that time and I've made it my life's mission to
[1:00:42.320 --> 1:00:49.440]  tell all of you out there what so many of you really know deep down that fame and Hollywood
[1:00:49.440 --> 1:00:56.080]  and the media machine are rotten to the core and they do hurt and they do damage at age 25
[1:00:56.880 --> 1:01:04.000]  her father and a judge ruled with many paid off doctors help that Britney Spears had dementia.
[1:01:05.360 --> 1:01:12.800]  So since then she's gone on to do a five-year residency in Vegas two shows a day she's gone
[1:01:12.800 --> 1:01:19.760]  on a tour in 2018 and what happened today is literally a cultural landmark moment it is a
[1:01:19.760 --> 1:01:27.040]  cultural reset she got to speak for the first time I believe in her life honestly and openly
[1:01:27.760 --> 1:01:32.800]  and what has been done to her is horrific and I know it seems like why should we care about a
[1:01:32.800 --> 1:01:38.160]  rich pop princess right but I think it's deeper than that and I think it goes to what you talk a
[1:01:38.160 --> 1:01:46.160]  lot about which is the rock in the machine and how society also plays a part in a weird form of
[1:01:46.160 --> 1:01:55.200]  oppression. Man I mean you've you've pushed all my buttons I have to say I mean the idea that
[1:01:55.200 --> 1:02:02.160]  the individual is crushed by forces larger than her and that deep down it really is rotten
[1:02:02.160 --> 1:02:08.560]  and that people are treated as disposable objects rather than as human beings with souls I mean
[1:02:08.560 --> 1:02:15.440]  that's all that's all a display every single day so pardon my ignorance but quickly conservatorship
[1:02:15.440 --> 1:02:22.560]  means she can't make basic life decisions for herself. Absolutely none she can make no decisions
[1:02:22.560 --> 1:02:28.240]  when she sees her kids what medicine she takes she said today Britney Spears said they put
[1:02:28.240 --> 1:02:36.240]  her on the lithium that is an incredibly helpful drug for some but a hardcore drug she said she
[1:02:36.240 --> 1:02:43.360]  was doped out I'm summarizing and she I think is ready to blow the lid she said today she's
[1:02:43.360 --> 1:02:49.360]  so angry it's insane and I understand that that kind of rage after being the sorry go ahead
[1:02:50.800 --> 1:02:54.400]  no no I know I didn't I didn't say they hold your eyes back ladies and gentlemen stay with us
[1:02:54.400 --> 1:03:02.240]  the fourth of july super sales starts now and in four more stores I've come

[1:04:09.120 --> 1:04:15.360]  defending the republic from enemies foreign and domestic it's alex jones
[1:04:15.360 --> 1:04:24.160]  all right he came out a few months ago with the video that's posted at gatewaypundit.com
[1:04:25.120 --> 1:04:30.560]  and we may get it played later but if you want to see it gatewaypundit.com has a whole article
[1:04:30.560 --> 1:04:35.920]  about it we'll put on screen for viewers so they can go see this and back this up for themselves
[1:04:36.720 --> 1:04:40.720]  and so that's the one request I have as we just put the article on screen there it is
[1:04:40.720 --> 1:04:46.960]  now we have proof fbi and dhs attempted to recruit green beret to infiltrate oath keepers
[1:04:46.960 --> 1:04:53.040]  before january 6 riot and he recorded it and that full interview and the full video of all of it
[1:04:53.760 --> 1:05:01.200]  is at gatewaypundit.com and has been a major major huge important breakthrough
[1:05:01.200 --> 1:05:05.680]  uh piece of information and I was just glad that bandot video was there because they tried to censor
[1:05:05.680 --> 1:05:10.000]  it on youtube and twitter it got I think a couple million views last time I checked when we were
[1:05:10.000 --> 1:05:15.360]  able to repost it to bandot video that's why bandot video was so precious and and why I'm so glad
[1:05:16.000 --> 1:05:20.400]  that Jeremy Brown and some of his folks reached out to us because this is key
[1:05:21.840 --> 1:05:29.120]  key information in all of this and now we're getting more video as they continue to try to recruit
[1:05:29.120 --> 1:05:36.720]  other people to do similar things like this Jeremy Brown's a us army veteran whistleblower
[1:05:36.720 --> 1:05:41.040]  he's a proud father former small business owner and decorated us army special forces combat veteran
[1:05:41.040 --> 1:05:46.160]  this February 20 years u.s military he's an american first patriot who has challenged the
[1:05:46.160 --> 1:05:51.600]  democrat establishment in florida when he ran for the u.s congress 2020 to this day he still fights
[1:05:51.600 --> 1:05:56.160]  for the promises of our forefathers life liberty and the pursuit of happiness which means he is a
[1:05:56.160 --> 1:06:00.480]  white supremacist according to the chairman joins the staff good to have you here brother but thank
[1:06:00.480 --> 1:06:05.760]  you sir and uh alex is actually better than that because it was bandot video that broke the story
[1:06:05.760 --> 1:06:11.760]  branding gray at just another channel dot com um a fellow info warrior he's the one that
[1:06:11.760 --> 1:06:17.600]  broke it march 5th and a gateway pun that picked it up from you guys and then now we're we're basically
[1:06:17.600 --> 1:06:23.440]  recycling it again so uh info it just goes to show the value of the info wars audience and
[1:06:23.440 --> 1:06:27.920]  the various channels that are out there on bandot video and we have time we'll play that video
[1:06:29.040 --> 1:06:34.080]  the importance of this obviously is right in front of us you got the floor here talk about your
[1:06:34.080 --> 1:06:37.600]  experience what they said what they did people can see the video for themselves at gateway punna
[1:06:37.600 --> 1:06:43.200]  dot com uh talk about uh where you see this going because for me just as a guy that research
[1:06:43.200 --> 1:06:48.720]  is history they're branding the american people as white supremacist anybody that's pro gun pro
[1:06:48.720 --> 1:06:54.240]  family pro uh you know election integrity and saying there's an imminent war about to happen
[1:06:54.240 --> 1:06:59.520]  and they want to arrest members of congress i'm sure you've seen uh all these fbi's on tv all of it
[1:06:59.520 --> 1:07:04.720]  but you were there they tried to recruit you ahead of the six to be part of the obvious infiltration
[1:07:04.720 --> 1:07:10.240]  and provocateur operation when i and actually that's what brought me out of the shadows because
[1:07:10.240 --> 1:07:16.560]  this happened uh december 9th uh shortly after i had just joined the oathkeepers and it was the
[1:07:16.560 --> 1:07:21.200]  blatant lies that i'm watching chris foray sit up there on capitol hill lying through his teeth
[1:07:21.200 --> 1:07:26.880]  about what actually happened there i was there on january 6th um and so that's when i decided to
[1:07:26.880 --> 1:07:34.000]  contact brandon and get the story out and um because i i needed other veterans to know that
[1:07:34.000 --> 1:07:39.120]  you're the targets of this right they're gonna continually do this they're gonna try to infiltrate
[1:07:39.120 --> 1:07:44.640]  you because this is unconventional war asymmetric war unrestricted war whatever title you want to
[1:07:44.640 --> 1:07:51.360]  give it the idea is to destroy these groups that they see as a threat first of all the american
[1:07:51.360 --> 1:07:57.040]  people they see as a threat but those that are already awake and understand what's going on like
[1:07:57.040 --> 1:08:02.960]  the oathkeepers the proud boys the three percenters or any variety of other organizations that are out
[1:08:02.960 --> 1:08:08.880]  there that have been following this for years they are the threat to these uh tyrants and so uh after
[1:08:08.880 --> 1:08:14.720]  november 3rd i said it you know it's time to link up with one of these groups or multiple of these
[1:08:14.720 --> 1:08:19.760]  groups and let them know what they're about to go through and what i explained to them is exactly
[1:08:19.760 --> 1:08:25.680]  what happened they were they were attempted to be and obviously were infiltrated by federal agents
[1:08:25.680 --> 1:08:31.280]  and federal operatives and more footage is coming out of not just jayden x working for cnn 90 000
[1:08:31.280 --> 1:08:36.320]  we now learn to go stage it's trying to get folks to burn it down working with other groups we now
[1:08:36.320 --> 1:08:41.840]  have more videos of more leftist dressing up posing as media provocaturing people i mean this was
[1:08:41.840 --> 1:08:46.480]  very easy you get a million people you trick a few hundred to attack the police are gonna attack
[1:08:46.480 --> 1:08:52.880]  back the morgan attack you started to borrow and brawl exactly i mean and it's it's even worse because
[1:08:52.880 --> 1:08:58.800]  he and i and i talk about this a lot they projected their insanity onto us and so they expected
[1:08:58.800 --> 1:09:03.920]  what what you see in the media the narrative is what they expected to happen so they already had
[1:09:03.920 --> 1:09:09.040]  the scripts written it's just like everything else the sparse pandemic cladex event 201 they
[1:09:09.040 --> 1:09:14.480]  script all this and so they already have the story lines written to deliver to the mockingbird
[1:09:14.480 --> 1:09:22.320]  media and so when we didn't react like a bunch of mind-numb robots well then their narrative didn't
[1:09:22.320 --> 1:09:28.480]  match what everyone who was there saw and that's why it's falling so you agree that it was a it was
[1:09:28.480 --> 1:09:34.160]  a misfire like like the what we saw was was one thousandth of what they wanted oh yeah of course
[1:09:34.160 --> 1:09:40.880]  100 it would be the equivalent if only building seven fell that's what it would be the equivalent
[1:09:40.880 --> 1:09:46.800]  right but see they know that uh if they if everything would have went the way they wanted to
[1:09:46.800 --> 1:09:52.560]  then then everything would be matching and then it would take years to discover the truth but now
[1:09:52.560 --> 1:09:58.560]  you see only a few months after the events it's all falling apart and it's because their narrative
[1:09:58.560 --> 1:10:04.160]  doesn't match what hundreds of thousands on the capital grounds and millions who were at
[1:10:04.160 --> 1:10:09.920]  the actual rally saw that day and so now people are coming forward because honestly people have
[1:10:09.920 --> 1:10:15.200]  been scared up to this point and now I think they're seeing people like myself and I and I'm a nobody
[1:10:15.200 --> 1:10:20.160]  I just I just don't like liars and so there's no you're not a nobody you're a great patriot a veteran
[1:10:21.520 --> 1:10:26.720]  and you are you have video that we can play later of them literally coming to your house and before
[1:10:26.720 --> 1:10:31.600]  this and trying to get you to go be part of this and lead this right and and not only that like I
[1:10:31.600 --> 1:10:37.040]  actually recorded their recruitment interview and I told them I was going to be recording it took
[1:10:37.040 --> 1:10:42.320]  about 15 minutes and if you go to the video on just another channel uh through banned out video
[1:10:42.320 --> 1:10:47.760]  you we go line by line we we pause it we say what were they doing here what did they mean by that
[1:10:47.760 --> 1:10:53.680]  and they literally mentioned something happening in january and this was before the president had
[1:10:53.680 --> 1:10:59.280]  even tweeted about the events see this was december 9th he didn't tweet about it until december 19th
[1:10:59.280 --> 1:11:05.520]  this is the smoking gun for radio listeners it's breaking fbi agents attempted to recruit former
[1:11:05.520 --> 1:11:09.920]  green beret to infiltrate oathkeepers proud boys we should probably add to the headline ahead of
[1:11:09.920 --> 1:11:15.040]  january 6 i mean this is smoking gun it's got a million and a half years it needs 100 million
[1:11:15.040 --> 1:11:18.880]  views to literally expose what's happening and in fact i bet you'd love to be called to congress
[1:11:18.880 --> 1:11:25.360]  to testify i would i would love to address my employees because they have not been performing
[1:11:25.360 --> 1:11:29.760]  to standard so let's start at the beginning we're going to play the video coming up later but
[1:11:29.760 --> 1:11:34.240]  but start at the beginning they come to your house what they say to you and then what it's like
[1:11:34.240 --> 1:11:40.320]  then watching january 6 unfold well so they they came to the house they actually uh knocked on the
[1:11:40.320 --> 1:11:46.640]  door my girlfriend uh answered the door even though she wasn't supposed to and had already told me
[1:11:46.640 --> 1:11:50.480]  that uh somebody was at door we thought it was the air conditioning repair guy so i actually
[1:11:50.480 --> 1:11:54.720]  come to the door to only to find two federal agents and they're asking for me but of course
[1:11:54.720 --> 1:11:58.720]  they never asked me directly so i never say anything so they're standing there we're looking
[1:11:58.720 --> 1:12:02.320]  at each other he hands me their card and they're like you know just let them know that you know
[1:12:02.320 --> 1:12:07.040]  we'd like to talk to him and and they use the cover story of we want to talk to him about
[1:12:07.040 --> 1:12:13.200]  some things he had posted online uh so yeah they called my cell phone i didn't answer finally i emailed
[1:12:13.200 --> 1:12:18.160]  him and then started the negotiation about when we would meet the circumstances of the meeting
[1:12:18.160 --> 1:12:23.520]  and then that's when on december 9th i actually sat down with the two agents i audio recorded the whole
[1:12:23.520 --> 1:12:29.680]  thing and then kind of kept it to myself then i actually went up to january 6 to help pull security
[1:12:29.680 --> 1:12:35.840]  forward to stop the steal um we act the detail i was on was actually the same detail jesca Watkins
[1:12:35.840 --> 1:12:42.160]  kelly megs who are all in prison now was on of the mother of one of the speakers and we escorted her
[1:12:42.160 --> 1:12:49.200]  from the ellipse down to the capital and so i had firsthand knowledge and of of just everything
[1:12:49.200 --> 1:12:54.320]  the the run up to it you know and the narrative that there was massive planning look i was pissed
[1:12:54.320 --> 1:12:59.120]  at the lack of planning so it's completely comical that they have a word for it in the marines i
[1:12:59.120 --> 1:13:06.080]  guess cluster fu yeah that's exactly right but hey you know i was the fng the f a new guy right so
[1:13:06.080 --> 1:13:12.400]  i kind of just stood back and uh the reality is that the we were there to protect people and and
[1:13:12.400 --> 1:13:18.160]  hundreds of people that day would come up and say thank you for being here gosh we feel so safe
[1:13:18.160 --> 1:13:23.440]  knowing that you're here and that's the reality we were there to protect american citizens that
[1:13:23.440 --> 1:13:29.920]  were exercising their first amendment right from those who would have wished to cause harm on them
[1:13:29.920 --> 1:13:34.240]  and uh and that's the true story so let's lay out what happened that day with the fbi did we've
[1:13:34.240 --> 1:13:38.560]  got the video and then where it's going now because i mean i'm no rocket scientist but they are
[1:13:38.560 --> 1:13:42.880]  pre-programming false flag everywhere imminent anyone that opposes the comic takeovers of white
[1:13:42.880 --> 1:13:47.280]  supremacist that's how they're dividing the two sides how do we expose that how do we stop that

[1:17:02.240 --> 1:17:07.360]  would like to say first off thanks for being the voice of reason and amongst all this stupidity
[1:17:07.360 --> 1:17:12.240]  wanted to warn people i've been trying to get a hold of you for a year okay i'm a double amputee
[1:17:12.240 --> 1:17:18.880]  and i have bacteria infection on my lung that'll never go away uh living defense saved my life
[1:17:18.880 --> 1:17:24.720]  they had me on antibiotics for two years that almost killed me living defense brought me back
[1:17:24.720 --> 1:17:31.120]  i wanted to just quote from the bible jesus is saying as to where we are right now this is Matthew
[1:17:31.120 --> 1:17:39.360]  24 verse 9 then they shall deliver you up to be afflicted and shall kill you and you shall be hated
[1:17:39.360 --> 1:17:45.840]  of all nations for my name sake and then shall many be offended and shall betray one another
[1:17:45.840 --> 1:17:51.280]  and shall hate one another that's right where we're at brother and that's because god's name is on
[1:17:51.280 --> 1:17:55.920]  the founding of this country no matter what they say and that's why the enemy hates it because god
[1:17:55.920 --> 1:18:07.200]  created this country you're listening to the alex jones show
[1:18:07.200 --> 1:18:09.200]  you
[1:18:21.040 --> 1:18:26.160]  you know the headline info wars dot com is is strong and then the video for a few months ago
[1:18:26.160 --> 1:18:31.280]  was powerful him sitting down with the fbi and and then saying something big's coming up on january
[1:18:31.280 --> 1:18:35.280]  six before trumpeting it announced it they were pre-programming we want you to infiltrate these
[1:18:35.280 --> 1:18:40.080]  groups the footage them coming up the front door we'll roll some of that v-roll for tv viewers but
[1:18:40.640 --> 1:18:45.760]  the most important thing to do is just go to band on video and we'll post it back right now guys
[1:18:45.760 --> 1:18:50.160]  as the featured video at the top because with everything happening right now this is smoking
[1:18:50.160 --> 1:18:57.120]  guns so jeremy brown former green beret patriot who they tried to infiltrate then you went to
[1:18:57.120 --> 1:19:02.640]  dc you witness what really happened lay out where you think we are now and and what they're currently
[1:19:02.640 --> 1:19:07.440]  doing because you're you're an expert on this you experience it from the before it happened
[1:19:07.440 --> 1:19:11.760]  the day of the event with all your background the military you know you're an expert on this
[1:19:11.760 --> 1:19:16.320]  what do you see in the programming of the joint chiefs of staff the chairman of the secretary
[1:19:16.320 --> 1:19:23.120]  defense saying the new doctrine of the entire government is attack white supremacist that's
[1:19:23.120 --> 1:19:27.520]  defined as anyone questioning elections anyone questioning open borders anyone questioning
[1:19:27.520 --> 1:19:32.720]  force of occupations that's in the new official policy report that biden put out last tuesday
[1:19:32.720 --> 1:19:38.000]  i mean this is a declaration of war against the american people in in my view am i wrong
[1:19:38.000 --> 1:19:42.960]  no you're not you're not wrong and luckily we have the recording of the president of the united
[1:19:42.960 --> 1:19:47.760]  states threatening the american people that if they want to overthrow the government they're
[1:19:47.760 --> 1:19:52.480]  going to need f-15s and nuclear weapons i mean if that doesn't wake people up i don't know what will
[1:19:52.480 --> 1:19:58.000]  i mean and and i've been calling over the last few days for sf command to strip general milley
[1:19:58.000 --> 1:20:04.560]  of his special forces tab because he has literally allowed an unconventional warfare operation to
[1:20:04.560 --> 1:20:11.360]  take place and be successful right under under his command on his watch and so he he does not
[1:20:11.360 --> 1:20:17.120]  deserve to wear the same tab in the green beret that i wear uh in my opinion and i've guaranteed
[1:20:17.120 --> 1:20:22.560]  there are thousands of green berets that would agree with me because on his watch america the
[1:20:22.560 --> 1:20:28.560]  republic has fallen and i truly believe that and it's not just january 6 this is just one
[1:20:29.120 --> 1:20:34.800]  of the many different things that are leading of this look at the vaccine death the psychological
[1:20:34.800 --> 1:20:40.880]  biological attack through the through america is under attack this is the new world war it's begun
[1:20:40.880 --> 1:20:46.000]  oh yeah i'm no no i'm the attack is uh been underway for quite some time and i tell people all
[1:20:46.000 --> 1:20:51.920]  the time this is the most successful sneak attack because most people don't even realize that it's
[1:20:51.920 --> 1:21:00.240]  happened i mean it makes the trojan horse tactic uh uh look at troi look tame yeah exactly and uh
[1:21:00.240 --> 1:21:06.080]  you know i think bad things are on the horizon and i would love to be positive your guest yesterday
[1:21:06.080 --> 1:21:11.360]  from uh black guns matter i can't remember i'm horrible with names but um he's coming back up
[1:21:11.360 --> 1:21:18.320]  today he had some great hello swilly when he's here yeah he has great points but the problem is that
[1:21:18.320 --> 1:21:23.040]  you know i i think it's just dire i mean i i want to be hopeful but i believe that we
[1:21:23.040 --> 1:21:26.480]  not going to make it out of this calendar year without well that's the thing is i was even
[1:21:26.480 --> 1:21:31.040]  talking to jet nusion his wife today's winner tomorrow this morning taping it they're like
[1:21:31.040 --> 1:21:35.760]  alec it's okay people are waking up they are waking up they should wake up even more this is the
[1:21:35.760 --> 1:21:41.360]  final assault they should have woke up four years ago or 10 years ago or before they passed the federal
[1:21:41.360 --> 1:21:47.200]  reserve act of 1913 right i mean this has been going on a long time so when you say dire as an
[1:21:47.200 --> 1:21:51.760]  expert what do you expect to happen because to me it's clear they've committed to full attack
[1:21:51.760 --> 1:21:57.280]  and that means hack attacks grid shutdowns uh there's a declaration of war is the the country
[1:21:57.280 --> 1:22:02.960]  itself by chai com agents i mean it's literally a takeover well this is what i fear and and just
[1:22:02.960 --> 1:22:11.840]  like with any surreptitious approach to a target you want to gain the surprise on the enemy and what
[1:22:11.840 --> 1:22:17.600]  i think is they expected to sneak biden in there and everyone to go along with it so that they
[1:22:17.600 --> 1:22:23.680]  could then gradually just continue to incrementally take over america you know call some race riots
[1:22:23.680 --> 1:22:29.680]  in the summer and then invite the unn they'll just all happen to be chinese um i think that was their
[1:22:29.680 --> 1:22:35.120]  original plan but the problem is that the election fraud is being exposed the covet fraud is being
[1:22:35.120 --> 1:22:40.400]  exposed it's all coming out so just like if i'm moving from my last covered and killed filled
[1:22:40.400 --> 1:22:46.640]  position up to the breach point and i get compromised then i just go full kinetic then it's be as loud
[1:22:46.640 --> 1:22:52.560]  and as many explosions and everything and i and i fear that the exposure of all this fraud is going
[1:22:52.560 --> 1:22:57.520]  to launch the consistent total commitment the kinetic aspect that's correct and for those that
[1:22:57.520 --> 1:23:04.480]  don't know what kinetic is think guns and explosions and so how do you expect them to hit claim a
[1:23:04.480 --> 1:23:09.440]  cyber attack takes out part of the power to distract us to have a mass shooting or i think
[1:23:09.440 --> 1:23:13.680]  we're starting to see that right i mean oddly buildings are collapsing again i mean where have
[1:23:13.680 --> 1:23:19.280]  we seen this before we've got odd explosions off the coast of florida i mean and and these are just
[1:23:19.280 --> 1:23:23.520]  the things that are actually making it into the news how many things are going on across we know
[1:23:23.520 --> 1:23:30.080]  mackavy was a spook with like the you call it majesty 12 group the nasa breakaway group he was
[1:23:30.080 --> 1:23:35.360]  actually part of that he did have a lot of dirt they killed him and everybody's just dropping dead
[1:23:35.360 --> 1:23:41.760]  these days either from the vaccine or from uh suicide but i'm not suicidal alex yeah let's
[1:23:41.760 --> 1:23:46.000]  be a million percent clear on that i'm never gonna let myself i mean don't get me wrong i mean i've
[1:23:46.000 --> 1:23:51.840]  had dark days in my in my life you know most veterans have but uh not these days so if anything
[1:23:51.840 --> 1:23:56.720]  happens to me ask them um how do they explain all the explosions and piles of brass i just want to
[1:23:56.720 --> 1:24:00.880]  say to veterans don't kill yourself because you feel not needed commit yourself to fight for the
[1:24:00.880 --> 1:24:04.240]  republic that's right fight for your fight for your life fight for the buddies to your left
[1:24:04.240 --> 1:24:07.760]  and right they just happen to now be your neighbors and not the guys you went through basic training
[1:24:07.760 --> 1:24:11.840]  with so what do you i mean millies obviously when i saw the body language of millie and austin in
[1:24:11.840 --> 1:24:17.440]  that hearing yesterday or the day before their arrogance their hate how they heard about critical
[1:24:17.440 --> 1:24:24.560]  radical race theory they got so excited their palpable hatred was clear well and and the fact
[1:24:24.560 --> 1:24:29.680]  that he referenced the three uh three fifths compromise tells you what side he's on because
[1:24:29.680 --> 1:24:35.840]  no conservative that's ever read a history book believes that the three fifths compromise was to
[1:24:35.840 --> 1:24:43.840]  degrade the the status of black americans it was actually to weaken the south by not giving them full
[1:24:43.840 --> 1:24:49.760]  credit so that they get more representation in congress but see only morons think oh we're such
[1:24:49.760 --> 1:24:54.880]  a horrible country that we only thought black people were three fifths of a person no it was a
[1:24:54.880 --> 1:25:01.680]  political strategic maneuver that actually led to the ending of slavery and you know you got june
[1:25:01.680 --> 1:25:06.960]  teeth well how come they don't say million or not millions but hundreds of thousands of white men
[1:25:06.960 --> 1:25:14.480]  are the ones that died as well as you know friebs free blacks that let that died for the abolishment
[1:25:14.480 --> 1:25:19.760]  of slavery see that's actual history that we should expect the generals of this country to

[1:27:32.880 --> 1:27:37.360]  i just thought it was a hopeless situation but when i started taking it i mean it doesn't happen
[1:27:37.360 --> 1:27:43.760]  immediately but you know over a period of time i started noticing okay you know this is a ticket

[1:29:55.520 --> 1:30:05.520]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[1:30:25.520 --> 1:30:29.440]  so look at him he's looking at my flag because my flag is displayed upside down
[1:30:29.440 --> 1:30:35.520]  for those of you that don't know an upside down flag is the official symbol of distress
[1:30:35.520 --> 1:30:45.520]  so
[1:30:54.720 --> 1:30:58.720]  again this is some of the raw footage at jeremy brown's house
[1:30:58.720 --> 1:31:03.920]  us army veteran green beret 20 years u.s military with the fbi visiting him
[1:31:03.920 --> 1:31:10.960]  him long before january 6 saying something's coming up in january we need your help to infiltrate
[1:31:11.680 --> 1:31:16.160]  these patriot groups we know that indeed happening now the evidence is not we actually
[1:31:16.160 --> 1:31:20.640]  have good audio and video and he did agree to interview them or have them interview him
[1:31:20.640 --> 1:31:25.920]  with him admitting to that so this is a big deal you're there witnessing it you're also there on
[1:31:25.920 --> 1:31:33.440]  january 6 what what do you expect him to try to pull you know i don't know exactly what they're
[1:31:33.440 --> 1:31:37.760]  going to try to pull but you can see the narrative unfolding right you they have the narrative of
[1:31:37.760 --> 1:31:44.400]  how evil oath keepers are how evil the proud boys are and their active infiltration of these groups
[1:31:44.400 --> 1:31:50.960]  and so it almost feels like they're setting up them as the fall guy for the next big thing
[1:31:51.760 --> 1:31:57.440]  and you know i have a few human sorts that's out there in the countryside and i'm actually hearing
[1:31:57.440 --> 1:32:04.400]  rumblings of the july 4th being that time frame and then and then today general flin you know you
[1:32:04.400 --> 1:32:11.920]  rolled that tape earlier where he's also talking about that so i i think um yeah you just feel
[1:32:11.920 --> 1:32:18.480]  like something's coming up and it feels the same way with january 6 i mean i went to dc not as a
[1:32:18.480 --> 1:32:22.640]  nosekeeper i was going there because i felt like something was going to happen and i felt like somebody
[1:32:22.640 --> 1:32:26.800]  needed to be there to knew what was going on and then from there i said hey guys i'm going to be
[1:32:26.800 --> 1:32:32.080]  there can i help you all with anything like that so you know you you've done this long enough you've
[1:32:32.080 --> 1:32:38.400]  been engaged in war all over the world and you just begin to develop that sense that something's not
[1:32:38.400 --> 1:32:44.800]  right here and and yeah i hope it's nothing but it feels like they're preparing for something much
[1:32:44.800 --> 1:32:50.800]  bigger well all the pre-programming is this is imminent so how do we counter a group that says
[1:32:50.800 --> 1:32:55.280]  any political opposition to democrats is white supremacism and now the official doctor of the
[1:32:55.280 --> 1:32:59.680]  u.s. government is you're a terrorist we're going to quote attack congress these are quotes of frank
[1:32:59.680 --> 1:33:05.680]  figliozzi of the fbi and others i mean they're really setting the stage for that and i don't just
[1:33:05.680 --> 1:33:10.080]  think out of bravada i think they really plan to try to wipe out their political opposition
[1:33:10.880 --> 1:33:14.880]  because they know election frauds coming out they know the public's turned against them
[1:33:14.880 --> 1:33:22.000]  well of course and we have a template of how this works i mean we have 1775 and 1717 1776
[1:33:22.000 --> 1:33:30.320]  um you know the founders attempted to rationally explain that you know you're not doing this the
[1:33:30.320 --> 1:33:36.960]  right way but it was when they moved on lexington and concord where uh you we were forced as the
[1:33:36.960 --> 1:33:41.760]  colonists at the time to stand up and say no you're not going to take our guns and you know
[1:33:41.760 --> 1:33:47.040]  the rest is history and so i think that's what we're going to be building to is america going
[1:33:47.040 --> 1:33:51.360]  to be prepared i hope so i know that there's a lot of people that are preparing for it
[1:33:51.360 --> 1:33:56.880]  but we need to expose them right we need to be the the alexander hamilton's of our day
[1:33:57.440 --> 1:34:03.600]  and go to these uh board meetings these school board meetings these city councils because they're
[1:34:03.600 --> 1:34:08.640]  afraid of us they're both they're ultimately a bunch of cowards people and if you confront them
[1:34:08.640 --> 1:34:12.720]  which is why they go to dc and they stay there they have apartments in dc they've got their
[1:34:12.720 --> 1:34:17.760]  little bubble and if we dare go in their bubble they shake in their but let me ask you this question
[1:34:17.760 --> 1:34:23.520]  clearly the chai comms and the globalists want a civil war here to take the us out
[1:34:24.160 --> 1:34:29.200]  for their power takeover and so that's why the left thinks they're about to conquer america
[1:34:29.200 --> 1:34:34.080]  they don't get they're about to scuttle and break the country so how do we deal with that the fact
[1:34:34.080 --> 1:34:38.160]  that someone to break the country up in a civil war they're going to precipitate things that will
[1:34:38.160 --> 1:34:43.440]  trigger a civil war but a certain point giving into the civil war gives them the breakdown of
[1:34:43.440 --> 1:34:48.640]  the country they want what if it's a civil war i think what's coming is no no i agree this is more
[1:34:48.640 --> 1:34:53.680]  of a globalist posing as a civil war correct i mean we're defending our homeland they want to
[1:34:53.680 --> 1:34:58.880]  they want to to make the narrative that it's about black versus white but it's not it's really about
[1:34:58.880 --> 1:35:03.760]  good versus evil right because that means that's a total red herring they're trying to super impose
[1:35:03.760 --> 1:35:09.280]  yeah yeah they're wanting to they know something's going to happen because they're pushing it
[1:35:09.280 --> 1:35:12.960]  they know there's going to be violence because they're going to make the violence happen
[1:35:12.960 --> 1:35:18.080]  they want the narrative to be look at these white supremacists killing black people when really it's
[1:35:18.080 --> 1:35:23.360]  going to be probably federal agents you know it's going to be more like your bundy ranches or your
[1:35:23.360 --> 1:35:27.760]  wacoes that's what we're looking at there and do the federal agents themselves so i don't just follow
[1:35:27.760 --> 1:35:33.600]  orders realize what a horrible war this will be even if they end up winning the war against america
[1:35:33.600 --> 1:35:38.960]  like to be a federal agent in a artificial civil war of america that is not a good place to be
[1:35:38.960 --> 1:35:43.200]  you know honestly i i don't know what they're thinking and i would love to believe the sean
[1:35:43.200 --> 1:35:48.560]  hanity line that 99% are good but that that's impossible there's no way that only 1% are making
[1:35:48.560 --> 1:35:53.280]  all this happen so if you're a federal agent out there now is the time to look inside yourself and
[1:35:53.280 --> 1:35:57.280]  say you know maybe i don't want to be a part of this early retirement might be the thing for you
[1:35:57.280 --> 1:36:03.200]  and i jokingly say all the time i wouldn't want to be the fbi agent that gets the jeremy brown target
[1:36:03.200 --> 1:36:09.440]  packet one week from retirement you know you might want to take that week in vacation because we
[1:36:09.440 --> 1:36:15.040]  have to start standing up you can't just stand around and expect that oh don't worry my lawyer
[1:36:15.040 --> 1:36:20.000]  will get me out because that's not what it's about folks these these political prisoners have been
[1:36:20.000 --> 1:36:25.120]  locked away for six months some of them not even being able to see their attorneys and even if they
[1:36:25.120 --> 1:36:29.200]  see their attorneys i'm telling you the defense and that doesn't intimidate people that makes the
[1:36:29.200 --> 1:36:36.400]  venera civilization peel off and then a real thing starts i mean it's it's really bad it's going to
[1:36:36.400 --> 1:36:43.280]  be bad and the the the less we're prepared for it the worse it will be so we we need to use our
[1:36:43.280 --> 1:36:48.880]  first amendment and then once we exhaust that fully be prepared to use the second and if you don't
[1:36:48.880 --> 1:36:55.120]  know the order of the amendments i definitely suggest you pick up a copy but as the less
[1:36:55.120 --> 1:37:01.920]  know they're being walked into a trap no i mean the leadership knows exactly but these students
[1:37:01.920 --> 1:37:07.920]  know nothing about what's going on they are literally just uh mind-numb robots being
[1:37:07.920 --> 1:37:12.400]  marched off the cliff they think and you talk about this like they think there'll be a i don't
[1:37:12.400 --> 1:37:15.520]  even think they're going to be in the power structure they don't think that they just
[1:37:16.160 --> 1:37:22.480]  they think that they're right because that merit garland get that they now capture america they
[1:37:22.480 --> 1:37:26.160]  can be the leaders of it why not be in charge of it why do they have this instinct to run on the
[1:37:26.160 --> 1:37:31.360]  ground where does that come from because they're globalists yeah american sovereignty is not a
[1:37:31.360 --> 1:37:38.240]  thing to them it's it's an impediment to their like they like going to davos they like want to
[1:37:38.240 --> 1:37:42.400]  leverage america into their takeover yeah yeah i mean and so us wanting our rights i mean the next
[1:37:42.400 --> 1:37:49.120]  is an it's an impediment yeah yeah they don't understand the concept of american exceptionalism
[1:37:49.120 --> 1:37:53.760]  they don't understand the concept of rugged individualism they're collectivists
[1:37:53.760 --> 1:38:00.640]  they think that the world is their playground and we are our you know the domestic terrorists
[1:38:00.640 --> 1:38:06.240]  like ourselves who believe that i know we're america and we are better look equality is
[1:38:07.760 --> 1:38:14.160]  it's ridiculous okay um special forces doesn't select based on equality we select based on
[1:38:14.160 --> 1:38:20.480]  excellence my business wasn't run based on being equal right we wanted to be better than
[1:38:20.480 --> 1:38:26.000]  everybody else and see that used to be the mantra of the american we're the best
[1:38:26.000 --> 1:38:31.520]  we want to be the best but see they want us to all be equally miserable and that is socialism
[1:38:31.520 --> 1:38:37.600]  communism uh and you know a few look at claus Schwab saying i will control your body you will
[1:38:37.600 --> 1:38:43.120]  have nothing you'll know nothing he's announcing slavery like it's the new cool garment well
[1:38:43.120 --> 1:38:47.600]  because they and said i just see an enemy right there their followers swab back on screen
[1:38:47.600 --> 1:38:53.520]  i mean look at that sack of filth look what they've been able to prove their followers will accept
[1:38:53.520 --> 1:39:00.080]  anything and so yeah they can come right out i mean they know these people are they're in a cult
[1:39:00.080 --> 1:39:06.000]  i mean jim jones uh knew that they were all gonna die they knew they were gonna die and they did it
[1:39:06.000 --> 1:39:11.600]  anyway this is the problem with with mind control and whether it's through the media whether it's
[1:39:11.600 --> 1:39:16.640]  through the chemicals they know what they've done exactly they've existentially set themselves up for
[1:39:16.640 --> 1:39:23.040]  a takeover and milley and austin are all signed on in a literal war against america so this is it
[1:39:23.040 --> 1:39:28.400]  folks traders inside traders without uh the old marine court general i quote from korea said thank

[1:45:48.360 --> 1:45:51.360]  If you wear it in a liberal area, you may get attacked in a conservative area.
[1:45:51.360 --> 1:45:53.360]  Somebody might buy you lunch.
[1:45:53.360 --> 1:45:58.360]  But to see how much the left hates American flags, like it's a vampire,
[1:45:58.360 --> 1:46:02.360]  hates holy water, or the cross, you've got to experience it for yourself.
[1:46:02.360 --> 1:46:05.360]  Let me ask you this question.
[1:46:05.360 --> 1:46:09.360]  Why do you think the left hates America so much?
[1:46:09.360 --> 1:46:14.360]  Not just the higher-ups, Mr. Brown, but the low-level...
[1:46:14.360 --> 1:46:17.360]  I only learned this because I knew they hated America 20 years ago.
[1:46:17.360 --> 1:46:20.360]  There was an event like three years ago in Austin.
[1:46:20.360 --> 1:46:27.360]  They shut down downtown, and it was called President Trump and Alex Jones and Fakeness.
[1:46:27.360 --> 1:46:30.360]  So they shut down downtown at thousands of people there,
[1:46:30.360 --> 1:46:33.360]  and I showed up and they freaked out that I showed up at my own event.
[1:46:33.360 --> 1:46:37.360]  But when I got up and spoke, they didn't care.
[1:46:37.360 --> 1:46:40.360]  They let me speak, but as I said, America's a great country.
[1:46:40.360 --> 1:46:42.360]  We should love it. We should unify behind it.
[1:46:42.360 --> 1:46:45.360]  They started howling, screaming, and grabbed the microwave from me.
[1:46:45.360 --> 1:46:49.360]  They really hate America, but they all want to get here.
[1:46:49.360 --> 1:46:51.360]  What is that about, Jeremy Brown?
[1:46:51.360 --> 1:46:53.360]  Well, I mean, we know the answer to this question,
[1:46:53.360 --> 1:46:56.360]  because Reagan warned us back when he was the president,
[1:46:56.360 --> 1:47:02.360]  and he warned us that America will fall at the hands of our education system.
[1:47:02.360 --> 1:47:07.360]  And Hitler knew this. If you control the youth, the mind of the youth,
[1:47:07.360 --> 1:47:09.360]  you educate them and indoctrinate them.
[1:47:09.360 --> 1:47:12.360]  When they grow up, they will do whatever you tell them to do,
[1:47:12.360 --> 1:47:18.360]  and that's what we're seeing. We're seeing a multi-decade operation
[1:47:18.360 --> 1:47:20.360]  to infiltrate the education system.
[1:47:20.360 --> 1:47:22.360]  Obviously, it started first in academia,
[1:47:22.360 --> 1:47:26.360]  but now you can't even go into preschool and kindergarten.
[1:47:26.360 --> 1:47:29.360]  Preschool teaches critical rights there.
[1:47:29.360 --> 1:47:32.360]  Yeah, and guess what? Now we've got VPK.
[1:47:32.360 --> 1:47:35.360]  We've got to get those kids at age three and four, Alex,
[1:47:35.360 --> 1:47:38.360]  because they need to know that America is bad,
[1:47:38.360 --> 1:47:41.360]  and that is why it is so bad.
[1:47:41.360 --> 1:47:45.360]  And see, you basically have a line of generations
[1:47:45.360 --> 1:47:48.360]  where I didn't have that when I went to school.
[1:47:48.360 --> 1:47:52.360]  So you're starting to see the culture clash
[1:47:52.360 --> 1:47:56.360]  between those who were educated from start to finish
[1:47:56.360 --> 1:48:01.360]  in a completely compromised and captured education system
[1:48:01.360 --> 1:48:03.360]  against those who went to school
[1:48:03.360 --> 1:48:05.360]  and didn't have that level of indoctrination.
[1:48:05.360 --> 1:48:08.360]  So that's how. They were trained. They were trained.
[1:48:08.360 --> 1:48:12.360]  And it doesn't take much to train them.
[1:48:12.360 --> 1:48:15.360]  If you start young enough, they're going to be exactly the way
[1:48:15.360 --> 1:48:18.360]  you want them by the time that they grow up.
[1:48:18.360 --> 1:48:21.360]  So what do we do? How do we stop this?
[1:48:21.360 --> 1:48:23.360]  Because clearly a false flag's about to happen.
[1:48:23.360 --> 1:48:26.360]  They're already killing a bunch of people. What do we do?
[1:48:26.360 --> 1:48:30.360]  Well, to be honest, I don't think that we're going to stop it.
[1:48:30.360 --> 1:48:34.360]  I think we're going to win it, right? It's coming.
[1:48:34.360 --> 1:48:36.360]  It's like Hitler invaded Russia.
[1:48:36.360 --> 1:48:38.360]  You're not going to stop the invasion. You're going to win it.
[1:48:38.360 --> 1:48:40.360]  Yeah. I mean, we're not going to appease them.
[1:48:40.360 --> 1:48:43.360]  They hate us. We're not going to maintain...
[1:48:43.360 --> 1:48:44.360]  So just get ready. It's coming.
[1:48:44.360 --> 1:48:50.360]  It's coming. But build your communities now, right?
[1:48:50.360 --> 1:48:53.360]  Oh, the power we have to warn this is about to happen.
[1:48:53.360 --> 1:48:55.360]  You're not going to have food. You're not going to have water.
[1:48:55.360 --> 1:48:57.360]  They're going to cut your power off.
[1:48:57.360 --> 1:48:59.360]  People will remember that later.
[1:48:59.360 --> 1:49:01.360]  We've got to tell them now the globalist did this to you.
[1:49:01.360 --> 1:49:04.360]  Right. And I say this.
[1:49:04.360 --> 1:49:06.360]  I've lost my five daughters.
[1:49:06.360 --> 1:49:10.360]  And my knowledge of what's going on has been used.
[1:49:10.360 --> 1:49:14.360]  I mean, I can show you the court documents where I'm dangerous to them
[1:49:14.360 --> 1:49:16.360]  because I'm a conspiracy theorist.
[1:49:16.360 --> 1:49:18.360]  I'm no kidding.
[1:49:18.360 --> 1:49:21.360]  And I say to my girlfriend, I go,
[1:49:21.360 --> 1:49:24.360]  you know, maybe someday they'll see these videos
[1:49:24.360 --> 1:49:27.360]  and they'll realize that I was right.
[1:49:27.360 --> 1:49:29.360]  I mean, I was literally accused of being dangerous
[1:49:29.360 --> 1:49:32.360]  because I was teaching my daughters how to start a fire.
[1:49:32.360 --> 1:49:34.360]  I mean, this is the insanity.
[1:49:34.360 --> 1:49:36.360]  This is the anti-human programming.
[1:49:36.360 --> 1:49:38.360]  It's the mind control over our youth.
[1:49:38.360 --> 1:49:39.360]  But you know what?
[1:49:39.360 --> 1:49:41.360]  Talk about that, though, because I've been through similar things
[1:49:41.360 --> 1:49:44.360]  where if you're literally a Christian, they say you're in a cult.
[1:49:44.360 --> 1:49:46.360]  Or if you're a pro-gun, they say you're going to kill everybody.
[1:49:46.360 --> 1:49:51.360]  Well, they project their mental illness.
[1:49:51.360 --> 1:49:53.360]  So you have five daughters and you lost them because you're a patriot?
[1:49:53.360 --> 1:49:55.360]  Five daughters. Yeah.
[1:49:55.360 --> 1:49:58.360]  I literally, if I want to see them, I have to coordinate
[1:49:58.360 --> 1:50:02.360]  as if I'm going to visit the skiff, basically.
[1:50:02.360 --> 1:50:05.360]  A secret base. And be babysat, right?
[1:50:05.360 --> 1:50:07.360]  I have to have supervised.
[1:50:07.360 --> 1:50:09.360]  All because you're just a patriot.
[1:50:09.360 --> 1:50:13.360]  Like, they train you to be a defender of the Republic,
[1:50:13.360 --> 1:50:15.360]  but then they treat you like an enemy once you are.
[1:50:15.360 --> 1:50:18.360]  I mean, I had a judge tell me that because of my background
[1:50:18.360 --> 1:50:21.360]  as a Green Beret, he was concerned I was going to kidnap my kids.
[1:50:21.360 --> 1:50:25.360]  I mean, veterans, and this was the struggle that people don't know.
[1:50:25.360 --> 1:50:29.360]  I lost a soldier to suicide and it wasn't because of PTSD.
[1:50:29.360 --> 1:50:31.360]  It was because they were discriminated against.
[1:50:31.360 --> 1:50:33.360]  His children were taken from him.
[1:50:33.360 --> 1:50:36.360]  He had four kids and the system uses...
[1:50:36.360 --> 1:50:38.360]  Well, it fears capable men.
[1:50:38.360 --> 1:50:39.360]  Yeah.
[1:50:39.360 --> 1:50:41.360]  And I tell men, don't feel bad as a system.
[1:50:41.360 --> 1:50:43.360]  Attack you. The real war is here now.
[1:50:43.360 --> 1:50:45.360]  The last thing you need to do is kill yourself.
[1:50:45.360 --> 1:50:47.360]  Kill the new old order politically.
[1:50:47.360 --> 1:50:49.360]  Work against it. Expose it.
[1:50:49.360 --> 1:50:52.360]  If you are living a wonderful life right now,
[1:50:52.360 --> 1:50:54.360]  then you're doing it wrong.
[1:50:54.360 --> 1:50:58.360]  Those that are under attack, they're under attack for a reason
[1:50:58.360 --> 1:51:00.360]  because they're the threats to evil.
[1:51:00.360 --> 1:51:03.360]  Evil is trying to conquer the world
[1:51:03.360 --> 1:51:06.360]  and it only prospers when good men do nothing.
[1:51:06.360 --> 1:51:09.360]  So if your life is awesome right now,
[1:51:09.360 --> 1:51:12.360]  and I'm not saying that you shouldn't have a positive attitude.
[1:51:12.360 --> 1:51:15.360]  No, but it's all peaches and cream. You're not taking on evil.
[1:51:15.360 --> 1:51:16.360]  That's right.
[1:51:16.360 --> 1:51:19.360]  I mean, if you're waking up and butterflies are fluttering around your head
[1:51:19.360 --> 1:51:22.360]  and you're dancing through the house singing about your vaccine,
[1:51:22.360 --> 1:51:24.360]  then you're doing it wrong.
[1:51:24.360 --> 1:51:26.360]  You're going to be dead soon.
[1:51:26.360 --> 1:51:31.360]  And so this is why we know that it's getting near the crescendo
[1:51:31.360 --> 1:51:33.360]  because the attacks are so heavy.
[1:51:33.360 --> 1:51:37.360]  And so that's why they got to round up as many of these patriots as they can.
[1:51:37.360 --> 1:51:41.360]  It's like the, you know, Emmanuel Goldstein and the Brotherhood, right?
[1:51:41.360 --> 1:51:47.360]  January 6 is being used as the, they're the ones we need to get first, right?
[1:51:47.360 --> 1:51:51.360]  They identified themselves by taking part in a presidential rally.
[1:51:51.360 --> 1:51:54.360]  And now they're going around door-to-door, rounding them up every day.
[1:51:54.360 --> 1:51:55.360]  And they brag about it.
[1:51:55.360 --> 1:51:57.360]  Which is a form of intimidation. It's anybody else.
[1:51:57.360 --> 1:52:00.360]  I mean, the feds literally brag.
[1:52:00.360 --> 1:52:03.360]  We've made a rest in all 50 states.
[1:52:03.360 --> 1:52:05.360]  We've intimidated political action.
[1:52:05.360 --> 1:52:08.360]  I mean, really, if you thought that we were under attack from domestic terrorism,
[1:52:08.360 --> 1:52:10.360]  you would make that statement sad.
[1:52:10.360 --> 1:52:12.360]  There would be sadness in your voice.
[1:52:12.360 --> 1:52:13.360]  You'd be like, oh my gosh, it's so bad.
[1:52:13.360 --> 1:52:15.360]  We're having to arrest people in all 50.
[1:52:15.360 --> 1:52:19.360]  But no, they're bragging about it because they know that they're evil
[1:52:19.360 --> 1:52:21.360]  and that they're trying to take us down.
[1:52:21.360 --> 1:52:22.360]  But you know what?
[1:52:22.360 --> 1:52:25.360]  Look at your house. The flag's upside down because we're in crisis.
[1:52:25.360 --> 1:52:26.360]  That's right. We are in crisis.
[1:52:26.360 --> 1:52:29.360]  And I, and I, and when I go to RV parks, I fly it upside down and they,
[1:52:29.360 --> 1:52:32.360]  and people come up to me and they're like, do you know,
[1:52:32.360 --> 1:52:33.360]  do you know your flags upside down?
[1:52:33.360 --> 1:52:34.360]  I go, oh, you're damn right.
[1:52:34.360 --> 1:52:35.360]  I know it's upside down.
[1:52:35.360 --> 1:52:37.360]  Do you know why it's upside down?
[1:52:37.360 --> 1:52:40.360]  And they go, yeah, I know because they're mostly veterans.
[1:52:40.360 --> 1:52:44.360]  They just want to make sure that I'm not a leftist that hates America.
[1:52:44.360 --> 1:52:48.360]  But then when I tell them that I'm not, they understand what I personally can feel
[1:52:48.360 --> 1:52:51.360]  look at that national strategy for kind of domestic terrorism.
[1:52:51.360 --> 1:52:55.360]  Official policy declares war on people that question checkpoints,
[1:52:55.360 --> 1:53:00.360]  that question force inoculations, that question elections or gun control.
[1:53:00.360 --> 1:53:05.360]  This is a declaration of war like December 7th, 1940, whatever,
[1:53:05.360 --> 1:53:08.360]  against the Japanese, but instead it's against us.
[1:53:08.360 --> 1:53:09.360]  It's just man.
[1:53:09.360 --> 1:53:13.360]  Well, I mean, it was one thing when Eric Swallowswell says that he's going to
[1:53:13.360 --> 1:53:15.360]  nuke us because he's just a joke, right?
[1:53:15.360 --> 1:53:17.360]  You know, sleeping with a Chinese spy.
[1:53:17.360 --> 1:53:23.360]  But when the sitting American president with an asterisk says that you can't
[1:53:23.360 --> 1:53:26.360]  overthrow us, we have F-15s and nuclear weapons.
[1:53:26.360 --> 1:53:28.360]  I mean, people should take that seriously.
[1:53:28.360 --> 1:53:31.360]  Well, it also shows a serious misunderstanding of military stuff.
[1:53:31.360 --> 1:53:32.360]  They control the cities.
[1:53:32.360 --> 1:53:34.360]  Why would they use nukes against their own infrastructure?
[1:53:34.360 --> 1:53:38.360]  It'd be very easy actually with ideology to overthrow these people physically.
[1:53:38.360 --> 1:53:41.360]  So the idea, you wouldn't use a nuclear weapon against a guerrilla attack.
[1:53:41.360 --> 1:53:42.360]  You couldn't defeat it with that.
[1:53:42.360 --> 1:53:44.360]  It just shows delusion.
[1:53:44.360 --> 1:53:46.360]  They're mad with power.
[1:53:46.360 --> 1:53:50.360]  And of course, he probably doesn't even have the nuclear codes now.
[1:53:50.360 --> 1:53:51.360]  I'm sure.
[1:53:51.360 --> 1:53:52.360]  Well, sure.
[1:53:52.360 --> 1:53:54.360]  But the idea like we'll just nuke some cities.
[1:53:54.360 --> 1:53:55.360]  That'll make us win.
[1:53:55.360 --> 1:53:56.360]  Yeah.
[1:53:56.360 --> 1:53:57.360]  Yeah, right.
[1:53:57.360 --> 1:53:58.360]  It's insanity.
[1:53:58.360 --> 1:53:59.360]  But they say it out loud.
[1:53:59.360 --> 1:54:01.360]  They say it out loud.
[1:54:01.360 --> 1:54:02.360]  I mean, people.
[1:54:02.360 --> 1:54:05.360]  Like if they nuke the city, that would make everyone turn against them.
[1:54:05.360 --> 1:54:07.360]  It wouldn't make us capitulate.
[1:54:07.360 --> 1:54:09.360]  I mean, I don't want to sacrifice the U.S. city.
[1:54:09.360 --> 1:54:10.360]  But you know what?
[1:54:10.360 --> 1:54:14.360]  For America, go ahead, buy nuke Chicago to show us the bounty you use, son of a bitch.
[1:54:14.360 --> 1:54:16.360]  It'll make everyone turn against you, you dumbass.
[1:54:16.360 --> 1:54:21.360]  It's watching a doddering, crypt-keeper threaten us with nuclear weapons is ridiculous.
[1:54:21.360 --> 1:54:24.360]  It doesn't do political or military doctrine.
[1:54:24.360 --> 1:54:26.360]  No one would act like that jerk.
[1:54:26.360 --> 1:54:27.360]  Right.
[1:54:27.360 --> 1:54:33.360]  And if you're wearing the uniform and that message comes through.
[1:54:33.360 --> 1:54:34.360]  Nuke America?
[1:54:34.360 --> 1:54:36.360]  Nuke San Antonio.
[1:54:36.360 --> 1:54:38.360]  Whoever gives you that order, you know what to do.
[1:54:38.360 --> 1:54:40.360]  We've got to uphold our oath.
[1:54:40.360 --> 1:54:41.360]  We are...
[1:54:41.360 --> 1:54:42.360]  Hold on.
[1:54:42.360 --> 1:54:44.360]  Come on, brother, coming up.
[1:54:46.360 --> 1:54:50.360]  Info Wars is here because there's a war on for your mind.
[1:54:50.360 --> 1:54:53.360]  That's why I spent our motto for more than 25 years.
[1:54:53.360 --> 1:54:58.360]  And if you research even the U.N.'s own admissions, over 2 billion people on planet Earth,
[1:54:58.360 --> 1:55:04.360]  out of 7.5 billion, have cognitive disabilities, lower IQ because of lack of iodine.
[1:55:04.360 --> 1:55:08.360]  That's why they work to make sure iodine isn't in the food, isn't in the salt anymore.
[1:55:08.360 --> 1:55:13.360]  Regular iodine that you find in food is bound to different minerals,
[1:55:13.360 --> 1:55:15.360]  and so it's hard for your body to absorb.
[1:55:15.360 --> 1:55:19.360]  But if you get the proper type of iodine, there's three types that are good for the body,
[1:55:19.360 --> 1:55:20.360]  it does amazing things.
[1:55:20.360 --> 1:55:22.360]  It's essential in the body.
[1:55:22.360 --> 1:55:25.360]  But we have our amazing tri-iodine, a big shipment payment,
[1:55:25.360 --> 1:55:29.360]  and so we're able to offer it at the lowest price ever, 60% off.
[1:55:29.360 --> 1:55:34.360]  That is, survival shield X3, 60% off with three types of powerful iodine.
[1:55:34.360 --> 1:55:38.360]  Tri-iodine is from a patented process that stabilizes the iodine
[1:55:38.360 --> 1:55:40.360]  and makes even more powerful the cellular level.
[1:55:40.360 --> 1:55:42.360]  You and your family will love it.
[1:55:42.360 --> 1:55:43.360]  It's incredible for your body.
[1:55:43.360 --> 1:55:45.360]  Get it in for Workshore.com today.
[1:55:46.360 --> 1:55:50.360]  I don't like coming to you and saying this could be our last broadcast.
[1:55:50.360 --> 1:55:53.360]  Hell, I've been on there 27 years, and only the last year or so have I said that.
[1:55:53.360 --> 1:55:57.360]  But let me tell you, the New World Order is breathing down our neck.
[1:55:57.360 --> 1:55:59.360]  The big, globalist publications are coming after us,
[1:55:59.360 --> 1:56:01.360]  and they're doing everything they can to shut us down.
[1:56:01.360 --> 1:56:04.360]  So please pray to keep Info Wars on the air,
[1:56:04.360 --> 1:56:07.360]  and please support the local states you're listening to as well.
[1:56:07.360 --> 1:56:11.360]  At the same time, go to infowarstore.com while you still can,
[1:56:11.360 --> 1:56:15.360]  and get a book, get a film, get a t-shirt, get some supplements,
[1:56:15.360 --> 1:56:19.360]  because it's that money that helps us stay on air in the face of this thing.
[1:56:19.360 --> 1:56:21.360]  I need your help more than ever now.
[1:56:21.360 --> 1:56:26.360]  I want to keep fighting the globalists, but I can't do it if you don't support us.
[1:56:26.360 --> 1:56:30.360]  So pray for us, word of mouth, tell folks about the broadcast however you can,
[1:56:30.360 --> 1:56:34.360]  and buy great products that will enrich you and your family's lives
[1:56:34.360 --> 1:56:36.360]  every day at infowarstore.com.

[1:56:40.360 --> 1:56:43.360]  all of it nurtures the soul, all of it empowers humanity,
[1:56:43.360 --> 1:56:46.360]  all of it is pro-human and pro-God.
[1:56:46.360 --> 1:57:10.360]  Thank you so much.
[1:57:17.360 --> 1:57:24.360]  And it's time for humanity to stand up in the Info War
[1:57:24.360 --> 1:57:27.360]  and say, I don't know what's going to happen at the end of this,
[1:57:27.360 --> 1:57:31.360]  but you want to fight, you better believe, you've got one!
[1:57:31.360 --> 1:57:38.360]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[1:57:38.360 --> 1:58:06.360]  According to the official narrative,
[1:58:06.360 --> 1:58:12.520]  COVID-19 was first discovered as a pneumonia outbreak in the city of Wuhan on December
[1:58:12.520 --> 1:58:15.720]  31st of 2019.
[1:58:15.720 --> 1:58:21.640]  And it wasn't until January 9th of 2020 when this supposed mystery virus was officially
[1:58:21.640 --> 1:58:25.520]  diagnosed as a novel coronavirus.
[1:58:25.520 --> 1:58:31.680]  Operation Warp Speed began on May 15th of 2020 to facilitate and accelerate the development
[1:58:31.680 --> 1:58:38.040]  of COVID-19 vaccines. Of the companies receiving research funding, the one responsible for the
[1:58:38.040 --> 1:58:42.400]  mRNA vaccine was Moderna.
[1:58:42.400 --> 1:58:46.200]  But we know that none of this checks out.
[1:58:46.200 --> 1:58:54.000]  We now know that Anthony Fauci used NIH funds to create a novel coronavirus capable of directly
[1:58:54.000 --> 1:59:01.000]  infecting humans. And we also know that Moderna has been working with Fauci's NIH on the
[1:59:01.000 --> 1:59:07.640]  mRNA COVID vaccine since December of 2019.
[1:59:07.640 --> 1:59:15.040]  Born in 2010 as Mode RNA Therapeutics, they were criticized for their radical specialty
[1:59:15.040 --> 1:59:23.160]  of mRNA biohacking that transforms human cells into drug factories and later changed their
[1:59:23.160 --> 1:59:26.840]  name to Moderna.
[1:59:26.840 --> 1:59:32.480]  With a reputation for losing top talent and keeping investors in the dark due to dangerous
[1:59:32.480 --> 1:59:39.080]  unpredictable side effects, Moderna somehow became Big Pharma's golden unicorn.
[1:59:39.080 --> 1:59:47.280]  They went public in December of 2018 with the largest ever IPO in the biotech industry.
[1:59:47.280 --> 1:59:53.160]  Without even having a safe effective product, they blew up faster than Uber.
[1:59:53.160 --> 1:59:59.400]  And a year later, before COVID-19 ever made headlines, Moderna was working with Fauci's
[1:59:59.400 --> 2:00:06.480]  NIH outsourcing redacted challenge studies where subjects are deliberately infected
[2:00:06.480 --> 2:00:13.440]  with the Fauci funded Wuhan lab made coronavirus and treated with Moderna's experimental gene
[2:00:13.440 --> 2:00:14.440]  therapy.
[2:00:14.440 --> 2:00:22.360]  And as fate would have it, the massive investment in Moderna paid off. Operation warp speed
[2:00:22.360 --> 2:00:30.360]  brought Moderna's COVID-19 payoff to just under $2.5 billion. And actual sales to the
[2:00:30.360 --> 2:00:35.040]  U.S. alone is already over $15 billion.
[2:00:35.040 --> 2:00:40.760]  There does not seem to be any breakthrough science. The mRNA shots are still proving
[2:00:40.760 --> 2:00:47.160]  to be as unpredictable and deadly as experts have been saying for years.
[2:00:47.160 --> 2:00:53.000]  And we now officially know that the shot is permanently changing the person's DNA.
[2:00:53.000 --> 2:00:57.600]  And yet, people are still lining up to get the shot.
[2:00:57.600 --> 2:01:03.400]  Thanks to media and Big Pharma. And thanks to the self-proclaimed philanthropists who
[2:01:03.400 --> 2:01:09.800]  fund the media and Big Pharma. The ones who call themselves the Good Club.
[2:01:09.800 --> 2:01:16.280]  The ones who met in 2009 to discuss how to save the world and how overpopulation was
[2:01:16.280 --> 2:01:23.720]  a major priority. How much more evidence do we need before we collectively realize that
[2:01:23.720 --> 2:01:27.360]  this entire thing is a scam?
[2:01:27.360 --> 2:01:50.560]  We're in for Wars.com. This is Greg Rees.
[2:01:50.560 --> 2:01:59.560]  We're in for Wars.com.
[2:01:59.560 --> 2:02:04.920]  July 4th, 2021 is now upon us. And that means our yearly big sale is here.

[2:02:55.760 --> 2:03:10.280]  It's Friday, June 25th. The year is 2021.
[2:03:10.280 --> 2:03:14.520]  The information war. It's Alex Jones.
[2:03:14.520 --> 2:03:19.400]  And here is the archetypal puppet of the globalist unable to even talk when he's not rubbing
[2:03:19.400 --> 2:03:27.400]  a child now whispering like a demon into the microphone.
[2:03:27.400 --> 2:03:34.720]  I got them $1.9 trillion relief so far. They're going to be getting checks in the mail that
[2:03:34.720 --> 2:03:41.000]  are consequential. I wrote the bill on the environment.
[2:03:41.000 --> 2:03:50.600]  Pay them more. This is an employee's, employee's bargaining chip now.
[2:03:50.600 --> 2:03:51.600]  What's happening?
[2:03:51.600 --> 2:04:01.200]  So we are literally seeing the fraud that stole the election insanely shutting down the economy
[2:04:01.200 --> 2:04:05.720]  for a year and a half with this deep state or even got in and now saying, I gave you
[2:04:05.720 --> 2:04:12.280]  consequential money. You get $1,600 twice a year, which won't even pay for your rent.
[2:04:12.280 --> 2:04:18.320]  Aren't you lucky? I control you. It's all that sick idea of I need to control somebody.
[2:04:18.320 --> 2:04:22.600]  I need to be in charge. All right.
[2:04:22.600 --> 2:04:27.880]  We have several great guests with us. Majtu Ray is Black Guns Matter doing an incredible
[2:04:27.880 --> 2:04:31.800]  job. I've seen some of his work was blown away by him in the city of yesterday. It was gracious
[2:04:31.800 --> 2:04:37.480]  enough to stay with us today. I've known well the last few months exposing the FBI false
[2:04:37.480 --> 2:04:42.400]  flag that was January 6, Jeremy Brown. I haven't even played the clip yet of him recording
[2:04:42.400 --> 2:04:48.400]  them saying something big is coming up. Big in January, we need you to infiltrate this.
[2:04:48.400 --> 2:04:52.000]  So guys, you really hit it off during that last five-minute break while I played that
[2:04:52.000 --> 2:04:56.720]  Greg Reese report that just broke. Where should we start with the false flag that General
[2:04:56.720 --> 2:05:01.160]  Flynn's warning about, claiming anybody that's pro-gun, pro-America, is a white supremacist
[2:05:01.160 --> 2:05:05.720]  as if anybody's buying that? Or should we get into Biden? Or should we get into the
[2:05:05.720 --> 2:05:10.520]  Second Amendment? Should we get into CNN panicking the record numbers of black Americans who
[2:05:10.520 --> 2:05:14.920]  are buying guns, which I love? This is an exciting time. Where should we start?
[2:05:14.920 --> 2:05:18.480]  Well, first and foremost, I think the first place that we start is making sure that we're
[2:05:18.480 --> 2:05:24.000]  recognizing that all these things are interconnected. And knowing, you know, and that grand chess
[2:05:24.000 --> 2:05:28.000]  board, it creates a space where, hey, we'll set this move up over here. And if you forget
[2:05:28.000 --> 2:05:31.080]  after a while, oh, we'll come right back to that. We got to remember that all of these
[2:05:31.080 --> 2:05:34.160]  things are interconnected. So when you're pushing for a bunch of black people that are
[2:05:34.160 --> 2:05:39.000]  buying guns because urban America is waking up, then you get some massive, overreaching
[2:05:39.000 --> 2:05:43.360]  anti-gun bills. Fortunately, you know, even with that 9-0 ruling with the Supreme Court
[2:05:43.360 --> 2:05:47.000]  saying, no, thank you for this disrespect for the Fourth Amendment, you have to remember
[2:05:47.000 --> 2:05:50.400]  that those things are connected. If we can get through your privacy and we can get you
[2:05:50.400 --> 2:05:54.200]  to stop talking and we can get you to not have the means to defend yourself, especially
[2:05:54.200 --> 2:05:58.080]  targeting black communities first, that's all connected. And by the way, I don't say
[2:05:58.080 --> 2:06:01.760]  this is some SJW, like, oh poor black people, it's true. Yeah. Why do the globalists have
[2:06:01.760 --> 2:06:06.400]  a particular love of depopulating disarming black people? Does that agree? Black folks
[2:06:06.400 --> 2:06:11.560]  start waking up becoming free buying guns. The left goes crazy. I feel good because criminals
[2:06:11.560 --> 2:06:15.600]  whether white or black are going to own guns anyways and use them wrong. I love black people
[2:06:15.600 --> 2:06:20.240]  buying guns. I mean, I got my concealed carry from a black guy. I mean, why are people
[2:06:20.240 --> 2:06:25.520]  afraid of that? I feel good. They're afraid because the vast majority of the people aren't
[2:06:25.520 --> 2:06:30.520]  afraid. They're afraid. The vast majority of the puppets and their puppeteers, those
[2:06:30.520 --> 2:06:34.680]  people are absolutely afraid. It's like a guy that can manipulate a bunch of women because
[2:06:34.680 --> 2:06:40.360]  he's actually not a strong dude. He's actually a lane. The lanes, I call them powers. There's
[2:06:40.360 --> 2:06:46.040]  nothing worse than a coward with power. And so these guys that are in the actual minority,
[2:06:46.040 --> 2:06:50.200]  those guys are afraid, but the general public feels more safe, feels more, I'm accountable
[2:06:50.200 --> 2:06:53.560]  for my life and my defense. That's the thing that we got to make sure that we create that
[2:06:53.560 --> 2:06:54.560]  distinction.
[2:06:54.560 --> 2:06:58.760]  Well, then the next step is this. After we wake them up on an individual level, we do
[2:06:58.760 --> 2:07:04.440]  this. They want to divide us and we say, hey, I'm a white supremacist, right? But yet I
[2:07:04.440 --> 2:07:10.720]  offer my skill set to your group. We bring white and black together because we are the
[2:07:10.720 --> 2:07:15.960]  same people. Take out your knife, cut yourself and see what color you bleed. We're all in
[2:07:15.960 --> 2:07:20.080]  this together. They're coming for all of us. They just think that they can manipulate
[2:07:20.080 --> 2:07:23.520]  black people more first and harder.
[2:07:23.520 --> 2:07:26.880]  And then Trump got triple the votes that panicked them. So what happens next?
[2:07:26.880 --> 2:07:31.280]  What happens next is the reality that they are coming. When you ever try to catch an
[2:07:31.280 --> 2:07:36.760]  animal and it's very, very cornered, they're very, very dangerous. Right now they're cornered.
[2:07:36.760 --> 2:07:40.600]  And that doesn't mean we let up on liberty or unity or things of that nature. That means
[2:07:40.600 --> 2:07:44.880]  we double down on what our actual standards are. We're honest about these things. There's
[2:07:44.880 --> 2:07:48.800]  nothing wrong with you being a, if you're a gay man, cool, that's your thing, but I'm
[2:07:48.800 --> 2:07:53.880]  allowed to be a straight man too. I'm allowed to be a gun owner. I'm allowed to hold public,
[2:07:53.880 --> 2:07:57.760]  you know, so-called officials accountable for their actions. That's the thing that we
[2:07:57.760 --> 2:07:58.760]  got to double down on.
[2:07:58.760 --> 2:08:02.200]  I agree. How do we get on the offense to let the left know we're awake and aren't buying
[2:08:02.200 --> 2:08:03.200]  their BS?
[2:08:03.200 --> 2:08:04.200]  Speak out.
[2:08:04.200 --> 2:08:05.200]  Yeah.
[2:08:05.200 --> 2:08:12.040]  I mean, and I keep going back to this, these school board meetings, these city council meetings,
[2:08:12.040 --> 2:08:17.520]  people are letting the little, the many tyrants, the many meads of tyranny, they're letting
[2:08:17.520 --> 2:08:21.720]  them know. And you can see these cars. I mean, they don't even know how to react. I think
[2:08:21.720 --> 2:08:25.960]  the one school board literally, they just got up and walked off from their platform
[2:08:25.960 --> 2:08:29.600]  seats, right? You notice how they build the platforms up high so they can look down on
[2:08:29.600 --> 2:08:30.600]  it.
[2:08:30.600 --> 2:08:33.520]  I noticed a little bit of the left to speak at first, knowing they would manipulate the
[2:08:33.520 --> 2:08:37.200]  parents and I'm not against the parents. I don't got mad too. Now we know they're trying
[2:08:37.200 --> 2:08:38.200]  to make us mad.
[2:08:38.200 --> 2:08:41.320]  Right. But this is what they do, Alex. So I did, when during my congressional campaign,
[2:08:41.320 --> 2:08:46.600]  I attended one of these delegations, right? You know, when they schedule them a Monday
[2:08:46.600 --> 2:08:47.600]  at 10 a.m.
[2:08:47.600 --> 2:08:48.600]  Yeah, when everybody's at work.
[2:08:48.600 --> 2:08:52.520]  Whenever, when we're at work, right, right, when those who don't need the government
[2:08:52.520 --> 2:08:57.200]  are out working hard for their families, for their communities, and all the leftists are
[2:08:57.200 --> 2:09:01.640]  the rooms full of leftists with their pet project, everything that's like a quarter
[2:09:01.640 --> 2:09:06.120]  million dollar project, right? So they know what they're doing, right? And then they can
[2:09:06.120 --> 2:09:10.680]  claim, Oh, well, nobody showed up to tell us. No one, no one spoke out.
[2:09:10.680 --> 2:09:13.760]  There's another angle that I want people to really understand. And then I'm saying this
[2:09:13.760 --> 2:09:18.520]  from a place of unity and understanding there. There has been racial hatred stoked in America
[2:09:18.520 --> 2:09:23.080]  by the media by design. With that being the case, one of the most, and this is more for
[2:09:23.080 --> 2:09:28.160]  the suburban, if you happen to identify using their term as white, right? You have to make
[2:09:28.160 --> 2:09:31.920]  sure that you're putting the effort in and saying, Okay, I see where the divide is. I
[2:09:31.920 --> 2:09:35.720]  have to make sure that my neighbor that may happen to be African American, my neighbor
[2:09:35.720 --> 2:09:40.560]  that may happen to be Mexican, Mexican American, I'm making sure that I'm creating that bond
[2:09:40.560 --> 2:09:44.640]  and creating that neighborhoodly thing because that goes, I totally agree because they use
[2:09:44.640 --> 2:09:49.760]  the separation great to fear. Correct. And that and by breaking that, when you run across
[2:09:49.760 --> 2:09:54.520]  the person like, Oh man, that guy was like super nice. Then when that media spin comes,
[2:09:54.520 --> 2:09:59.280]  your point of reference, your lived experiences now. No, that's that's that he I know he's
[2:09:59.280 --> 2:10:04.440]  from urban America, but not that that's just like super nice. Right. You have those barriers
[2:10:04.440 --> 2:10:07.960]  up, you know, or those filtration systems to weed through a lot of the foolishness.
[2:10:07.960 --> 2:10:13.880]  They want us to focus on the fact on our differences, not our likenesses. We're all under attack
[2:10:13.880 --> 2:10:19.320]  by globalists that are poisoning us with a vaccine with GMO with 5G. We should all come
[2:10:19.320 --> 2:10:22.920]  together. They want us to say they want me to look at you and go, Oh, you can't hang
[2:10:22.920 --> 2:10:26.840]  out with him. He likes rap music. Maybe you like country music. Never mind the fact that
[2:10:26.840 --> 2:10:30.400]  I listen to classical music all the time. But see, they put in my mind, right? They
[2:10:30.400 --> 2:10:35.640]  don't want me to look at him be like, I bet he the father, right? Who loves his kid, right?
[2:10:35.640 --> 2:10:40.560]  Who mows his yard, right? When when when he has people over so that his house looks nice.
[2:10:40.560 --> 2:10:44.800]  So they want disunity. How do we have unity? None of their levels control because they
[2:10:44.800 --> 2:10:48.240]  want to terrorize us, make us unify under their control. How do we unify outside their
[2:10:48.240 --> 2:10:52.920]  control? Expanding the exposing that contradiction to the maximum degree. So when you have, there's
[2:10:52.920 --> 2:10:59.720]  a great meme of a picture of Snoop Dogg and Martha Stewart. And under it, it says stereotypes.
[2:10:59.720 --> 2:11:04.520]  They're amazing on only one of these people is a convicted felon. Now it's not Snoop.
[2:11:04.520 --> 2:11:07.800]  Now the reality is that's not an attack on Martha Stewart or anybody or any ethnicity.
[2:11:07.800 --> 2:11:12.200]  That's a good point is the point is that contradiction is there. The thing that you've been told to
[2:11:12.200 --> 2:11:18.520]  receive as fact isn't a most times, especially if it comes off of MSM or corporatized media.
[2:11:18.520 --> 2:11:22.920]  And we have to recognize that and find those little pockets of unity that we can create.
[2:11:22.920 --> 2:11:27.480]  And that breaks that over. I totally agree. But General Flynn, Warren's and I agree. Yeah,
[2:11:27.480 --> 2:11:31.520]  they've pre programmed a false flag. Yeah. How do we stop the coming false? You cannot
[2:11:31.520 --> 2:11:36.400]  stop it. Yep. It's not, it's not a stop. It's, it's like a wave. Like we talked about yesterday.
[2:11:36.400 --> 2:11:41.440]  You're not going to stop it, embrace it and be prepared for it. Some things are inevitable.
[2:11:41.440 --> 2:11:45.200]  Evil. So they're going to, they're going to shoot up and blow up a black church or a
[2:11:45.200 --> 2:11:49.040]  Kotler to kill like 300 black people and then say, I did it. I'm going to be sitting here
[2:11:49.040 --> 2:11:53.280]  on Monday morning, like I'm being blamed for this. How do I counter that? But Alex, we,
[2:11:53.280 --> 2:11:59.760]  we defeated it by knowing right that it was after the fact. See, see, no, in your part of this,
[2:11:59.760 --> 2:12:06.320]  right? September 11th, ladies and gentlemen, was a false flag. It wasn't inside job. All right.
[2:12:06.320 --> 2:12:13.520]  You don't believe me. Look into it. But from September 11th until 2007 is how long it took
[2:12:13.520 --> 2:12:18.560]  me to learn that. Right. But now what do we see? January 6th, ladies and gentlemen,
[2:12:18.560 --> 2:12:24.240]  wasn't inside job. Now, how long is it taking it to get exposed? So what we're doing is we're
[2:12:24.240 --> 2:12:30.480]  condensing that awakened time, right? And that's how we defeat them. So if everyone is looking
[2:12:30.480 --> 2:12:35.040]  for the false flag, it doesn't work. The beauty of that is, there's no different than with this
[2:12:35.040 --> 2:12:40.160]  so-called, so-called vaccine. The reality is the reason why they're going so hard is because even,
[2:12:40.160 --> 2:12:44.320]  especially in urban America, we're seeing black people going like, nah, bro, I'm not taking that.
[2:12:44.320 --> 2:12:48.960]  They're trying to pay LeBron to take it, pay the, yeah, come out. The reality there. Let's talk about
[2:12:48.960 --> 2:13:01.760]  it. Wow. Your voice counts. When you share information, be it over the internet or in person,
[2:13:01.760 --> 2:13:06.560]  it changes the world. The globalists know their agenda is unpopular. They know you're angry.
[2:13:07.200 --> 2:13:12.560]  And now to get around big tech, it's more important than ever that we use every tool we've got.

[2:15:54.320 --> 2:16:00.240]  I'm up here working on a Thursday night in mid-April 2021 and I just want to say something. I am so
[2:16:00.240 --> 2:16:04.720]  blessed and honored to work with this incredible crew that has come together over the years. It
[2:16:04.720 --> 2:16:09.280]  is truly an answer to prayer and I am so blessed and thankful for all of you, the listeners of this
[2:16:09.280 --> 2:16:13.840]  show. I want you to know that I love you and I appreciate you. Whether you are old, whether you
[2:16:13.840 --> 2:16:17.920]  are Hispanic, white, black, it doesn't matter, you've got red blood. And if you love freedom and
[2:16:17.920 --> 2:16:23.680]  justice and if you love our innocent children, we are brothers and sisters together and it has just
[2:16:23.680 --> 2:16:28.960]  been an incredible experience to work with you over the years. And as crazy your things are,
[2:16:28.960 --> 2:16:34.160]  I want to keep working under the future. But again, that's really up to you and up to God.
[2:16:34.160 --> 2:16:39.440]  So please, I hope God works through you and puts a message in your heart to support us.
[2:16:39.440 --> 2:16:43.040]  But again, that's up to you and your relationship with God. I just want to thank you all
[2:16:43.040 --> 2:16:47.760]  for the years of support you've given us and what you've done and just ask you again to pray to God
[2:16:47.760 --> 2:16:52.480]  and ask what God's vision is for you and hopefully God will touch your heart to continue to support
[2:16:52.480 --> 2:17:14.400]  it for us. God bless. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:17:14.400 --> 2:17:27.120]  Here's the thing. I've been on air 27 years and I know when the mission is nearing completion
[2:17:28.080 --> 2:17:34.720]  and it makes me like really breathe hard because there's a new world ahead of this and I hope to
[2:17:34.720 --> 2:17:39.440]  still be here after it's done. I'll never commit suicide. But by that I mean I can tell this is
[2:17:39.440 --> 2:17:44.560]  the big one, folks. This is the big final takedown of America. I hope it doesn't succeed. We're all
[2:17:44.560 --> 2:17:48.720]  in a lot of danger and all these idiots that go along with the evil. I feel so sorry for
[2:17:48.720 --> 2:17:53.520]  us. They're going to be destroyed as well. We've got Maaj Turei here. We also have Jeremy Brown
[2:17:53.520 --> 2:17:59.040]  here, two smart guys, a black guns matter and a former Green Beret and Patriot who the feds
[2:17:59.040 --> 2:18:06.000]  tried to infiltrate to infiltrate January 6 and do a setup going back to the or this moment.
[2:18:06.000 --> 2:18:11.440]  Mr. Turei, what would you call this moment we're in? And Mr. Brown, what would you call this moment
[2:18:11.440 --> 2:18:16.400]  we're in? Because I can feel the energy, not just intellectually, but spiritually, the energy's
[2:18:16.400 --> 2:18:22.640]  never been this strong. The moment is we're at the plank scale in quantum physics on the lowest
[2:18:22.640 --> 2:18:27.680]  amount of where you can match. Right. When you get to that point, it's just choices and it bubbles
[2:18:27.680 --> 2:18:33.520]  up into the physical reality. Then you have physics and physical laws. We're at that tipping point
[2:18:33.520 --> 2:18:38.560]  where it turns into which direction are we going to go. We're all made of the same stuff,
[2:18:39.200 --> 2:18:43.280]  the direction that we're going to go and creating that physical reality. That's heavy. So it's all
[2:18:43.280 --> 2:18:48.560]  primordial right now. Yep. And we make the decision to make it bubble up. But you do that,
[2:18:48.560 --> 2:18:53.040]  like you were saying, by speaking out about it and the word became flesh. Right.
[2:18:53.040 --> 2:18:59.440]  Creating. Exactly. If we don't speak out, we submit whoever did speak. Right. And your silence
[2:18:59.440 --> 2:19:04.720]  is an acceptance. No, no, thank you. My quiet about it. You know, Dr. Martin Luther King said
[2:19:04.720 --> 2:19:10.640]  there comes a time when silence becomes betrayal. We cannot betray ourselves to our own liberty.
[2:19:10.640 --> 2:19:14.800]  I agree. I do all these men that are tougher than I better look at them here. They sit there and
[2:19:14.800 --> 2:19:18.800]  play the system like they're smart. They make me so mad. Yeah. Because they sit on the fence.
[2:19:18.800 --> 2:19:25.200]  Right. Right. And I would describe this as the crescendo. Right. We're coming into the final
[2:19:25.200 --> 2:19:31.360]  act where where all the heroes and the villains, they've all set up all the characters. You know,
[2:19:31.360 --> 2:19:38.240]  the drama is building. And now we're about to see does the good guy win in the end? And I'm in,
[2:19:38.800 --> 2:19:43.360]  you know, in Hollywood, they make the good guy win in the end, which is kind of weird. But in real
[2:19:43.360 --> 2:19:51.360]  life, I don't know if the generations of good guys losing. Yeah. Hey, look, we might get sucked
[2:19:51.360 --> 2:19:57.040]  under into 1000 years of slavery. The American Revolution. We were getting our butts kicked.
[2:19:57.040 --> 2:20:01.360]  Yeah. The whole time. Right. Until the end. But George Washington persevered.
[2:20:02.000 --> 2:20:05.520]  And and George Washington and those guys were able to say
[2:20:07.040 --> 2:20:12.960]  for my future. Right. I'm a coward if I don't do anything for my future and my children's children's
[2:20:12.960 --> 2:20:17.920]  children's children's children's future. We are getting that baton. We have to stay the course.
[2:20:17.920 --> 2:20:23.520]  I have a different take. I don't think there's a the bad guy wins. I think the bad guy knows
[2:20:23.520 --> 2:20:29.920]  how to slow up time and stop the inevitable, which is yeah. Well, Satan sends the beast with a wrath
[2:20:29.920 --> 2:20:37.680]  because he knows the time is short. In any operation, we say the enemy has a vote. You can
[2:20:37.680 --> 2:20:42.320]  have the best plan in the whole wide world, but the enemy has a vote, right? Meaning their actions
[2:20:42.320 --> 2:20:47.280]  can change. And I think that's what you're seeing. You're seeing that the move counter move, right?
[2:20:47.280 --> 2:20:53.360]  Yeah. Sure. The globalists have a plan. Satan has a plan. But our actions, right,
[2:20:54.160 --> 2:20:58.800]  shift that plan, right? It's like shifting the flow of water, right? You put some sand there
[2:20:58.800 --> 2:21:05.680]  and it goes that way. Right. And so we we can't do nothing. And I get emails from 70 year old
[2:21:05.680 --> 2:21:13.040]  women who ask me, well, what can I do? Yeah, right. We can all do something. The saying doesn't say
[2:21:13.040 --> 2:21:18.800]  evil prospers when good does this specific thing. Right. No, I agree. So I want to expand on that,
[2:21:18.800 --> 2:21:24.560]  Mr. Brown. So so so what are you saying, Marge, about about this time in history? You were trying
[2:21:24.560 --> 2:21:30.640]  to say that this time in history is actually a repeat of all that we're in those histories.
[2:21:30.640 --> 2:21:36.320]  If we are in this simulation, our choices affect the simulation. So our choices and decisions that
[2:21:36.320 --> 2:21:41.840]  we make, making that quantum physical reality, and we make the decisions individually and
[2:21:41.840 --> 2:21:46.080]  collectively, if we actually agreed that we're all interconnected, and I believe and I have to
[2:21:46.080 --> 2:21:51.360]  say believe, I believe that we are. And if we are our decisions, based on how we view the world,
[2:21:51.360 --> 2:21:58.080]  based on the information that we receive, that's why the opposition, the minority of lower level,
[2:21:58.080 --> 2:22:04.800]  lower dwelling energies, the minority, their hate, hate moves faster, but love is more powerful.
[2:22:04.800 --> 2:22:10.800]  That's the reason why they go so hard to make sure that this information, this wavelength,
[2:22:10.800 --> 2:22:16.880]  this vibe, this vibration is not is subdued. So we make that decision by collectively making
[2:22:16.880 --> 2:22:21.520]  that decision individually and collectively to shift that paradigm in our direction.
[2:22:21.520 --> 2:22:23.600]  I totally agree with you, because that's that's what I've seen.
[2:22:24.960 --> 2:22:31.600]  I mean, we're saving the world by taking an action, right? And it's an action, whatever it is,
[2:22:31.600 --> 2:22:36.560]  whatever your action is, whether it's speaking out, whether it's writing letters, whether it's
[2:22:36.560 --> 2:22:42.080]  it's going on media shows, whether it's because there's not just evil in the universe. But God
[2:22:42.080 --> 2:22:46.800]  wants to see us put ourselves in that position to make the decision. I mean, if you know how to
[2:22:46.800 --> 2:22:51.200]  grow a garden, teach your neighborhood how to grow a garden and then start your own little
[2:22:51.200 --> 2:22:56.400]  collective, because that really the message I keep getting is like, you got to want to save
[2:22:56.400 --> 2:23:00.640]  your family, save the world. You got to get back to the earth. You've got to become self-sufficient.
[2:23:00.640 --> 2:23:03.840]  You got the message you get. Yeah, absolutely. You got to be that's that's the difference between
[2:23:03.840 --> 2:23:09.040]  conservatism and liberalism. Conservative and that ideology, based on the actual definition,
[2:23:09.040 --> 2:23:14.480]  right? You change yourself. You become better for the world. The world becomes better. The
[2:23:14.480 --> 2:23:19.200]  liberal agenda is let's use the state to force people. The problem with that is it influences
[2:23:19.200 --> 2:23:25.040]  and restricts individual liberty. So for us as having more of a conservative, respectable,
[2:23:25.040 --> 2:23:28.160]  freedom based liberty, hey, those are your freedoms and your liberties. These are mine
[2:23:28.160 --> 2:23:32.560]  over here. We're going to change internally, change our children, change our neighbor,
[2:23:32.560 --> 2:23:36.240]  grow a show our neighbor how to grow a little bit of food. And then before you know it,
[2:23:36.240 --> 2:23:40.800]  the price of cabbage changes, right? Because everybody in the 10 block because when we all
[2:23:40.800 --> 2:23:46.080]  become producers, right, we become rich. We're not slaves, right, right? When they know that if
[2:23:46.080 --> 2:23:51.200]  they can keep us ignorant, yeah, then they can go out on national television like the president and
[2:23:51.200 --> 2:23:55.920]  make claims like, well, you know, the Bill of Rights has never been absolute from the very
[2:23:55.920 --> 2:24:02.960]  beginning. No, right. That is correct. In fact, it was in there to be absolutely like that.
[2:24:02.960 --> 2:24:06.000]  Let me ask you this guys, because I used to get tears of my eyes maybe like once here on there,
[2:24:06.000 --> 2:24:10.640]  I'm getting it every day now. Do you feel the force of humanity's will rising? Yes,
[2:24:10.640 --> 2:24:16.560]  evil. Like humanity feels the attack, right? I would say you're a much more positive individual
[2:24:16.560 --> 2:24:24.320]  than I am, right? Because I mean, and maybe it's the basis of I fear war because I lived in war.
[2:24:24.320 --> 2:24:29.680]  I don't want what's coming to happen because I know how horrible it is. I've lost so many
[2:24:29.680 --> 2:24:36.160]  friends in war. And and sadly, I think that is the mindset of most of the guys that I know.
[2:24:36.160 --> 2:24:40.400]  My friends, a good buddy of mine, I'm like, I really need to talk to you. And you know,
[2:24:40.400 --> 2:24:46.160]  this response was, I'm not leaving my family. Yeah. Yeah, I didn't even tell him what I wanted
[2:24:46.160 --> 2:24:52.240]  to talk to about. Yeah, but he knows what I know. I mean, he knows where my mind is. We were roommates
[2:24:52.240 --> 2:24:56.880]  in special forces, and that was his response. You're already saying job, right? Yeah, we know
[2:24:56.880 --> 2:25:01.760]  what they're going to take his family. They're going to take his family. And we all know that,
[2:25:01.760 --> 2:25:07.120]  but we hate war so much. And see, that's they're lucky that we hate war so much or it would already
[2:25:07.120 --> 2:25:12.320]  be exactly all these wimps want to play it war, right? Well, they have no idea. Here's the balance,
[2:25:12.320 --> 2:25:16.560]  Mark Milley, and I know we about to go into a break. Here's the balance. The balance is what
[2:25:16.560 --> 2:25:24.000]  but Krishna told Arjuna on the battlefield in the Bhagavad Gita. And we only got a few seconds left.
[2:25:24.560 --> 2:25:31.440]  In that story, Krishna shows Arjuna the visual of the war against evil coming shows that it's
[2:25:31.440 --> 2:25:35.280]  already done. You have to pick up your mantle, and you have to do it. Well, the very nature of
[2:25:35.280 --> 2:25:39.200]  who you are will force you to do it. And you'll just suffer the entire way. We have to act.
[2:25:39.920 --> 2:25:44.000]  Explain that when you come back. That's heavy. You're absolutely right. All right. It is the
[2:25:44.000 --> 2:25:48.480]  good or the wrong. It is the battle of the gods straight ahead.
[2:25:56.000 --> 2:26:01.760]  Your voice counts. When you share information, be it over the internet or in person,
[2:26:01.760 --> 2:26:06.560]  it changes the world. The globalists know their agenda is unpopular. They know you're angry.
[2:26:07.200 --> 2:26:12.560]  And now to get around big tech, it's more important than ever to use every tool we've got.

[2:30:02.000 --> 2:30:26.640]  So, I can feel the energy of humanity rising to the challenge of the globalist contest.
[2:30:26.640 --> 2:30:36.480]  What is the globalism game? If we gave them full power, if we submitted their will, if we bowed
[2:30:36.480 --> 2:30:44.400]  and became slaves of this world system, what is their goal? Well, I say this a lot and you have
[2:30:44.400 --> 2:30:51.360]  to first realize that they're all under the power of Satan ultimately, whether they call it that
[2:30:51.360 --> 2:30:58.640]  or whatever. And we know what Satan's plan is to destroy the creation. And so, if you look at the
[2:30:58.640 --> 2:31:03.040]  Georgia Guidestones, it has 500 million, but you know, once they get to 500 million, they'll tell
[2:31:03.040 --> 2:31:07.360]  100 million. You know, we don't really need those other 400 million. And then he'll say,
[2:31:07.360 --> 2:31:12.320]  oh, we don't need it. And the ultimate goal of Satan is to be down to two people left.
[2:31:12.320 --> 2:31:15.840]  He'll convince one to murder the other one and the last one to commit suicide.
[2:31:15.840 --> 2:31:19.200]  You just released the main transmission. That's it right there.
[2:31:19.200 --> 2:31:23.200]  I mean, that's the plan. That's the reality. God literally told me, as you did you,
[2:31:23.200 --> 2:31:26.560]  that's the plan of Satan. Yeah. And God gave us the plan to counter it.
[2:31:26.560 --> 2:31:30.560]  The reality is that remember the movie where Heath Ledger played the Joker?
[2:31:30.560 --> 2:31:33.600]  Yeah. In the beginning of the movie, he did exactly that. He had a bunch of guys and they were
[2:31:33.600 --> 2:31:38.320]  going to rob the bank. And nobody knew who the Joker guy was. And he was like, oh, and this guy
[2:31:38.320 --> 2:31:42.080]  on the roof shot that guy. His plan was to shoot this guy. And his plan was to go to hand you
[2:31:42.080 --> 2:31:46.480]  got to shoot this guy. And I don't know what his Joker guy's at. And then stand right here. And
[2:31:46.480 --> 2:31:50.800]  then the bus came in and knocked the last dude off. And the last guy was the actual Joker.
[2:31:50.800 --> 2:31:55.920]  The Joker in the movie. Also, the statement was Alfred told Batman,
[2:31:56.640 --> 2:32:02.960]  some people just want to see the world burn. Yep. He has no interest. I don't care about the money.
[2:32:02.960 --> 2:32:07.600]  I don't care about he burnt a half a mountain of money. The reality is that's the agenda.
[2:32:07.600 --> 2:32:11.760]  So when it's talking about what they look, okay, let's, and they say it, the population control
[2:32:11.760 --> 2:32:17.440]  and it's the vaccine of this so-called vaccine to get it down to I win because I took out.
[2:32:17.440 --> 2:32:23.280]  But we have a play in that again, like you said, we are the opposition to them. We get a vote.
[2:32:23.280 --> 2:32:28.160]  We get a mask. But you're right. So they're the Joker. Who are we? Oh, absolutely Batman.
[2:32:28.160 --> 2:32:33.200]  Absolutely Batman. When we need to be, we're Batman. When we need to be at a certain point,
[2:32:33.200 --> 2:32:38.080]  we don't need Batman to show up. We need Bruce Wayne and his resources and his mind.
[2:32:38.080 --> 2:32:43.840]  And at certain times I have to be banged because of the fact that I have to put on this mantle of
[2:32:43.840 --> 2:32:48.240]  you are unjustified. And going to the thing we were talking about before the break,
[2:32:48.800 --> 2:32:55.120]  at a certain point in the story of the Bhagavad Gita, Arjuna was an archer. He lost his way.
[2:32:55.120 --> 2:33:01.120]  He lost his focus. Krishna materializes the Godhead to be, to carry his arrows for him in his,
[2:33:01.120 --> 2:33:06.080]  in his, you know, his arches bucket. And Krishna's teachings up until that point was empathy for all,
[2:33:06.080 --> 2:33:12.080]  including the enemies. But the reality was Krishna told Arjuna, listen, your teachings of
[2:33:12.080 --> 2:33:17.440]  empathy were only up until this point. The reality is now the enemies of good are coming.
[2:33:17.440 --> 2:33:21.040]  And they don't have this dilemma that you have. You're not picking up your mantle because you're
[2:33:21.040 --> 2:33:26.080]  afraid and you're, you're using empathy to not fight in the war. And he shows them a vision.
[2:33:26.080 --> 2:33:32.080]  Hey, this, these enemies of good are already dead and life is already connected. You can pick up
[2:33:32.080 --> 2:33:38.000]  your mantle and do what you need to do. Or the very essence of who you are will force you to do
[2:33:38.000 --> 2:33:42.400]  it. And you'll just suffer. And that's my frustration because I feel like killing these people,
[2:33:42.400 --> 2:33:46.080]  but I don't want to give in to have those little spin that like, who do I kill? I don't want to
[2:33:46.080 --> 2:33:50.880]  kill anybody, but they're attacking us. I, my body's like, kill, kill these people.
[2:33:50.880 --> 2:33:55.680]  Well, I mean, I think it ends like the way V for Vendetta ends, right? We're going to all come
[2:33:55.680 --> 2:34:02.720]  together at some point. Yeah, whatever part of us is left at that point, we'll all be the same
[2:34:03.440 --> 2:34:10.560]  marching on the, the, the powers that be, right? And good always wins, but not all of us are going
[2:34:10.560 --> 2:34:16.320]  to get out of this struggle alive on this planet, right? I mean, none of us get out of life alive.
[2:34:16.320 --> 2:34:21.840]  So we should all be in it together. And the beauty of that is, is just knowing that life
[2:34:21.840 --> 2:34:27.360]  isn't limited to this physical shell. Yeah. Life isn't. So this spirit is definitely real.
[2:34:27.360 --> 2:34:31.920]  I say it's real. It's legit. And I just, well, there's no more fear once you get that, right?
[2:34:31.920 --> 2:34:36.400]  Right. Fear of what? False evidence appearing real. I'm, I'm good with it because it's literally
[2:34:36.400 --> 2:34:41.520]  not what color we are. It's what our spirit is. What are we doing with that animated spirit
[2:34:41.520 --> 2:34:46.080]  that's in this shell casing? Those are the questions and the choices. When you have those
[2:34:46.080 --> 2:34:53.520]  internal conversations with self legit, am I being a coward right now? Am I being brave right now?
[2:34:53.520 --> 2:34:58.320]  Do I know how to move different? Am I ignorant? Having those legitimate conversations with self
[2:34:58.320 --> 2:35:02.560]  and that higher self that God had, those are the things that we have to start focusing on.
[2:35:02.560 --> 2:35:08.800]  Right. And we're all here for a reason. Right. I mean, if I told you my life story over the last
[2:35:08.800 --> 2:35:15.840]  10 years, it's not pretty. Yeah. I mean, I struggled. I literally had moments where I wanted to,
[2:35:15.840 --> 2:35:22.240]  to end it. I mean, and we all have had dark times. Everyone I talked to is like, man,
[2:35:22.240 --> 2:35:28.320]  I feel like I was prepared for this moment. I'll tell you what's crazy is about both Jeremy Brown
[2:35:28.320 --> 2:35:33.840]  and Marge Thuray. I feel like it's how the universe was like, I've known you guys forever.
[2:35:33.840 --> 2:35:38.960]  That's why like, I'm like, this is, I mean, they actually said, what did Joe say, Molly,
[2:35:38.960 --> 2:35:44.480]  when when Marge Thuray was actually crying? No, I like, I was totally upset yesterday. I feel
[2:35:44.480 --> 2:35:47.680]  like I'm not doing that to fight this. And then I met you and I felt so good.
[2:35:48.320 --> 2:35:50.320]  Thank you. I'm humbled.
[2:35:50.320 --> 2:36:04.400]  It's real. Yeah, it is real. They're about to kill a bunch of people.
[2:36:04.960 --> 2:36:12.480]  No, they're killing them now. I mean, and, and, and this is what I like to tell guys.
[2:36:12.480 --> 2:36:16.240]  We've got to defeat them. We've got to defeat them. And, and I, and I'm telling you,
[2:36:16.240 --> 2:36:20.720]  everything's coming together right now. And, and I'm just glad you guys are here right now,
[2:36:20.720 --> 2:36:26.560]  because they're, you can feel it. The enemy is about to hit us. Well, and, and then everything's
[2:36:26.560 --> 2:36:33.200]  over, folks. All the games, the movies, TV shows, the BS, it's all over, man. It's world government
[2:36:33.200 --> 2:36:38.720]  killing everybody. And I didn't want, I didn't always do this was coming. And now we're here.
[2:36:39.680 --> 2:36:44.000]  When Einstein knew it, he said that, you know, his, his, my, his favorite quote was,
[2:36:44.000 --> 2:36:47.440]  I don't know how to fight the third world war, but I know the fourth one will be with sticks and
[2:36:47.440 --> 2:36:53.760]  stones. And you know, maybe this is what we need. Right? Maybe we need to be returned back
[2:36:53.760 --> 2:36:58.480]  to our original state where we have our homesteads and we take care of our families.
[2:36:58.480 --> 2:37:02.080]  That's what happens. Yeah. I mean, and, and, and maybe that's our
[2:37:02.800 --> 2:37:06.960]  fabulous reset. We'll call it the fabulous reset. How about that? The beauty of it is
[2:37:06.960 --> 2:37:13.360]  is technology will still exist. The human experience will still be here, but we'll hate it,
[2:37:14.000 --> 2:37:18.560]  or maybe, yeah, or, or maybe the reason why there's so much suicide and death is because
[2:37:18.560 --> 2:37:23.680]  we're chasing these artificial realities that aren't actually beneficial. And don't get me
[2:37:23.680 --> 2:37:29.680]  wrong. Technology is great. It's advanced humanity for some time, but too much of anything is a
[2:37:29.680 --> 2:37:35.360]  trap. Oh, it's a Trojan horse. Yeah. That, that Trojan horse of, oh man, this is great. Oh,
[2:37:35.360 --> 2:37:39.840]  yeah, this is great. But now do you want to live every single portion of your life sitting down
[2:37:39.840 --> 2:37:43.520]  in front of a camera, in front of a screen? Do you want that? Do you want to go on?
[2:37:43.520 --> 2:37:49.920]  What I'm saying is it's the, it's the will to defeat this and then, and then, and then
[2:37:50.560 --> 2:37:54.320]  meeting folks like you that are ready to defeat it. Yeah. Does that make sense? Absolutely.
[2:37:54.320 --> 2:38:02.240]  When we have no choice, I love my family too much. And even if the school system or whatever has
[2:38:02.240 --> 2:38:06.960]  twisted their mind against me, it doesn't change my love for them. And if I have to continue to
[2:38:06.960 --> 2:38:11.760]  fight outside of their view, then that's what I'll do. That's what I've always done. Right.
[2:38:11.760 --> 2:38:17.040]  Not one time did I ever take my children to Iraq, Afghanistan, Sri Lanka or any of these places,
[2:38:17.040 --> 2:38:20.720]  but I was fighting for them. And that's what we're doing. That's where I'm at.
[2:38:22.880 --> 2:38:27.680]  I just want to protect my family. And then I'm just, I want to, I love everybody.
[2:38:27.680 --> 2:38:38.320]  The love is returned and the love is what will drive us forward. That love and that passion
[2:38:38.320 --> 2:38:42.880]  for humanity, that's the power. Let me tell you what, I know it's just about to get bad.
[2:38:43.600 --> 2:38:48.480]  I literally have 50 times of the sermon and power I've ever had now. It's like just
[2:38:50.240 --> 2:38:54.480]  and you have the platform. But I'm saying something big is about to happen. Right.
[2:38:54.480 --> 2:39:00.560]  Because it's like big deal. It's powerful. And I've heard you say that you have way more listeners
[2:39:00.560 --> 2:39:05.600]  now. That's not by that. That's not by coincidence. Right. Oh, it's exponential. I mean, all I'm
[2:39:05.600 --> 2:39:10.560]  saying is it's not, it's all of us this, they're about to like, I don't know, nuclear war. I don't
[2:39:10.560 --> 2:39:14.880]  know. It's bad folks. We got to get ready. We got to get next to Christ. And we got to get ready.
[2:39:14.880 --> 2:39:19.920]  We got to prepare for this. I can feel it. It's a hundred times anything I ever felt. It's
[2:39:19.920 --> 2:39:25.760]  what you're talking about is what I call a beautiful ugly. It's beautiful and the synchronicity
[2:39:25.760 --> 2:39:31.600]  and working of it. And we're here to be a part of this experience. It's ugly because A, some people
[2:39:31.600 --> 2:39:36.960]  may not be aware or B, the outcome of what those unaware people that won't be prepared for that.
[2:39:37.680 --> 2:39:42.800]  They can't handle it. Right. Right. And because we're empathetic beings for sentient beings,
[2:39:42.800 --> 2:39:47.280]  we feel for them. We pick up the feeling that you don't even know what's happening.
[2:39:47.280 --> 2:39:50.960]  Exactly. I feel your death. Right. I feel the death. Stay with us.
[2:39:53.360 --> 2:39:58.640]  I am a very humble person, but I'm also a bold person. And so as bad as things are with the
[2:39:58.640 --> 2:40:03.040]  globalist attacking humanity, with all the terrible things that are unfolding, I want you to know
[2:40:03.040 --> 2:40:09.040]  a lot of positive things are happening as well. I'm a public figure. So I get to see things that
[2:40:09.040 --> 2:40:13.120]  the Republic doesn't get to see. And let me tell you, whether it's police chiefs or members of
[2:40:13.120 --> 2:40:20.560]  Congress or even folks in Hollywood or mainstream media or industry, people are really, really
[2:40:20.560 --> 2:40:25.440]  awake in the establishment. They don't want to go along with the globalist, but they're scared.
[2:40:25.440 --> 2:40:30.720]  They're looking for leadership. Well, that's where M4 comes in. You fund us. You support
[2:40:30.720 --> 2:40:36.160]  M4.com. You get rape proxy at the same time. We will then go out and do what the globalists
[2:40:36.160 --> 2:40:40.960]  say is unpopular, what the globalists will target you for to show people that it's safe
[2:40:40.960 --> 2:40:47.360]  to tell the truth and to take the heat. That's our job. So please keep us on air so we can hit
[2:40:47.360 --> 2:40:52.560]  the bar wire so we can be the shock groups for the information war. Fund us at M4store.com.
[2:40:53.360 --> 2:41:00.000]  The world is awakening. The world is beginning to understand the globalist paradigm. They are
[2:41:00.000 --> 2:41:05.360]  discovering the globalist, the elites, the manipulation, the CFR, the trilateral commission,
[2:41:05.360 --> 2:41:12.320]  the Bilderberg group, the Bohemian Grove, the club of Rome. And so even though it seems like the
[2:41:12.320 --> 2:41:18.560]  globalists are winning, the truth is they've had to come out of the open to attack human freedom
[2:41:18.560 --> 2:41:25.360]  because they're actually losing. We have forced them out in the open. So as bad as these times are,
[2:41:25.360 --> 2:41:30.240]  a lot of negative things are about to happen. Realize humanity is winning. You've got to trust
[2:41:30.240 --> 2:41:37.600]  in the plan of God and trust in the plan of God's justice. That is invincible. That is ethereal,
[2:41:37.600 --> 2:41:43.360]  timeless, and unstoppable. So don't trust in man. Trust in God to lead God and direct your soul
[2:41:43.360 --> 2:41:47.760]  and then take action against the globalists and realize you've got my commitment from Alex Jones
[2:41:47.760 --> 2:41:53.040]  and my crew to you. We will never back down from the globalists and we will never surrender.

[2:43:56.880 --> 2:43:59.520]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[2:44:10.000 --> 2:44:16.640]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, Mac. So Mac, if he's dead, so I mean, I'm not an emotional guy on air.
[2:44:16.640 --> 2:44:23.280]  I'm not an emotional. I'm emotional. I'm emotional. I can feel the energy of humanity.
[2:44:23.920 --> 2:44:27.360]  Is it full power? And you can all feel it as well.
[2:44:28.000 --> 2:44:34.000]  It's a magic moment because a major assault is coming. What is that major assault?
[2:44:34.800 --> 2:44:38.720]  My's to Ray, and then I want to get Jeremy Brown's take on that as well.
[2:44:38.720 --> 2:44:43.360]  Unless you disagree, that clearly a quickening is coming. A great moment is coming.
[2:44:43.360 --> 2:44:50.800]  They're, they're very, very afraid because their power is slipping. That speed pattern of,
[2:44:50.800 --> 2:44:54.240]  we knew about this and we found out seven years later. Now we know about this.
[2:44:54.240 --> 2:44:58.320]  A few months later, we can debunk these things. It's not the Tower of Babel anymore.
[2:44:58.320 --> 2:45:03.440]  They want us babbling, communicating around each other over each other babbling.
[2:45:03.440 --> 2:45:06.400]  Now we're actually having communication. We're interfacing. Right.
[2:45:07.040 --> 2:45:10.480]  So because of that, you know, there was that scares the aliens, the devil.
[2:45:10.480 --> 2:45:12.960]  Absolutely. Absolutely. But it's scared in a good way.
[2:45:12.960 --> 2:45:15.920]  You're scared because we're winning. We are already winning.
[2:45:15.920 --> 2:45:20.320]  And how, how that transpires in whatever physical realm of, of them trying to apply.
[2:45:20.320 --> 2:45:23.680]  So it's because we're interfacing, they're going to panic and launch a war.
[2:45:24.240 --> 2:45:28.800]  Which actually may work out in our favor because all of the things that we've
[2:45:28.800 --> 2:45:34.400]  been saying for however long, now it's, it's definite. Now this is what happened.
[2:45:34.400 --> 2:45:38.320]  This is what they did. And we have the information in a paper trail to show that.
[2:45:38.320 --> 2:45:42.800]  Now there's the skepticism that we may have, you know, been engaging.
[2:45:42.800 --> 2:45:46.560]  Now it's to a certain extent is like, nah, in a hood, we, we not skeptical about this,
[2:45:46.560 --> 2:45:50.080]  this so-called vaccine. People are going like, no, I read medical apartheid.
[2:45:50.080 --> 2:45:54.640]  I know what y'all doing. They're informed. And since they're informed, it's harder to trick them.
[2:45:54.640 --> 2:45:57.440]  So when they're so pissed that black folks aren't dumb.
[2:45:57.440 --> 2:46:01.760]  Absolutely. Absolutely. Because it's contrary to the entire narrative.
[2:46:01.760 --> 2:46:05.360]  It's contrary to the entire narrative. Because if I can get black people to do it,
[2:46:05.360 --> 2:46:09.200]  black people created hip hop and jazz in America, in the middle of, you know,
[2:46:09.200 --> 2:46:12.960]  enslavement or negative conditions. So if black people can create this thing
[2:46:12.960 --> 2:46:16.240]  and make an impact on the world, right? Okay, we definitely-
[2:46:16.240 --> 2:46:17.600]  We're trying to hijack black people.
[2:46:17.600 --> 2:46:21.440]  We got to subdue those people first. So we can subdue those people there.
[2:46:21.440 --> 2:46:24.240]  Oh, we can roll the marketing out to the rest of the world.
[2:46:24.240 --> 2:46:28.560]  But if it's not working in your primary demographic, your target market,
[2:46:28.560 --> 2:46:32.800]  now you got a problem. Now you actually have to deal with humans as humans.
[2:46:32.800 --> 2:46:36.480]  They're afraid and it's in a good way. When your patsies go off the rail,
[2:46:36.480 --> 2:46:40.960]  you're in trouble, right? Yes. And this is what your statement is wrong.
[2:46:40.960 --> 2:46:45.760]  The war has already started, right? They're not starting a war. They're engaged in a war.
[2:46:45.760 --> 2:46:50.320]  We're just starting to fight back. And what they want is order out of chaos.
[2:46:50.320 --> 2:46:56.400]  See, they want the war to be blamed on me and my fighting each other.
[2:46:56.400 --> 2:47:01.600]  So they can say, oh, well, look at them, too, that white supremacists and that poor black guy
[2:47:01.600 --> 2:47:05.520]  fighting each other, we've got the solution. See, they want the order out of chaos.
[2:47:05.520 --> 2:47:08.080]  They create the problem and then they offer the solution.
[2:47:08.080 --> 2:47:15.360]  But by exposing that actually they started the war, now we can all unite.
[2:47:15.360 --> 2:47:21.120]  And the best way to end the war is win decisively and quickly.
[2:47:21.120 --> 2:47:27.440]  And if we come together, that will happen. But if we continue to buy into their
[2:47:27.440 --> 2:47:30.640]  order out of chaos model- We've got to figure out the scam.
[2:47:30.640 --> 2:47:33.920]  Do you not feel the energy in this room? Yes, of course, yes.
[2:47:33.920 --> 2:47:38.400]  All bullshit aside. Yes. Yes. Listen, as we're discussing this thing,
[2:47:38.400 --> 2:47:43.200]  again, going back to that Joker- I feel victory. Absolutely. Literally, going back to that same
[2:47:43.200 --> 2:47:48.880]  reference, right? Heath Ledger's Joker put a bunch of so-called criminals on one boat
[2:47:48.880 --> 2:47:54.320]  and regular citizens on one boat and told them, yeah, that side over there is going to blow you up.
[2:47:55.120 --> 2:47:58.800]  So the other side, that side over there is going to blow you up, right?
[2:47:58.800 --> 2:48:01.360]  God bless the dead, tiny Zeus Lister was one of the characters.
[2:48:01.360 --> 2:48:05.600]  And he took the remote detonator from one of the citizens on one boat and he just said,
[2:48:05.600 --> 2:48:10.480]  we're not going to do anything. And the Joker was maniacal because I wanted to scare you both
[2:48:10.480 --> 2:48:15.200]  into blowing each other up. I wanted to convince you to kill your fellow countrymen,
[2:48:15.200 --> 2:48:20.880]  your other patriots. And the people in recognizing that and having a little bit of trust in the
[2:48:20.880 --> 2:48:25.920]  vast majority of humanity, the vast majority of humanity, having a little bit of trust for
[2:48:25.920 --> 2:48:31.920]  your fellow countrymen and countrywomen and saying, no, you're the enemy. You're the Joker.
[2:48:31.920 --> 2:48:37.040]  So how do we agree? How do we do that? That obviously Joe Biden and his KKK group is the
[2:48:37.040 --> 2:48:44.160]  enemy. How do we do that? You gotta want it. Yes. You gotta want it. You've got to want your liberty.
[2:48:44.160 --> 2:48:49.840]  Yeah. You've got to want your liberty. We were telling a story between break of a class,
[2:48:49.840 --> 2:48:54.240]  it's like a ranger school class. I mean, a guy dies of hypothermia and it was like 50 degrees.
[2:48:54.240 --> 2:49:01.200]  He gave up because nobody else died in that exact same conditions. They wanted to live.
[2:49:01.200 --> 2:49:06.000]  He decided to be a victim. Right. And of course, he blamed on Hector, but no,
[2:49:06.800 --> 2:49:11.680]  that isn't what killed him. His lack of mental decision. Right. A mental decision.
[2:49:11.680 --> 2:49:16.400]  They've shown that like if you decide you're sick, you die. Right. And it's no different than those
[2:49:16.400 --> 2:49:23.280]  in the persecuted church that they say, get down on your knees and kiss our feet or bow down and
[2:49:23.280 --> 2:49:27.360]  they don't do it. And what do they do? They kill them. Right. So what? Right. Kill me. Right.
[2:49:27.360 --> 2:49:34.880]  We have to stand up because look, humans, you know, courage is contagious, but it also is
[2:49:34.880 --> 2:49:39.680]  suppressed if nobody steps up. Oh, absolutely. No one will quit until the first one does,
[2:49:39.680 --> 2:49:44.480]  and no one will fight until the first one does. A depressed, a depressed person or
[2:49:44.480 --> 2:49:49.520]  collective group of people is far easier to control. Absolutely. Far easier to control.
[2:49:49.520 --> 2:49:54.960]  You depress, you make that decision to give up. Well, take like they had Facebook Docs released
[2:49:54.960 --> 2:50:00.000]  five years ago where they said, our goals are to make you alone and depressed. Yeah. So we control
[2:50:00.000 --> 2:50:05.760]  your whole and we have bots that control you. Imagine being those people that would come up
[2:50:05.760 --> 2:50:10.640]  with something like that. That's the only way they can defeat us. See, it's just like they think they
[2:50:10.640 --> 2:50:16.560]  can censor us in what's happening. Right. More people are learning the truth because of their
[2:50:16.560 --> 2:50:20.960]  sensory. You know what? If they didn't censor, no one would probably even be paying attention.
[2:50:20.960 --> 2:50:25.360]  Let me just say in the four months we got left, I'm so blessed by our listeners over the years
[2:50:26.160 --> 2:50:33.840]  supporting this that in this time and space in 2021, we're on air fighting them.
[2:50:33.840 --> 2:50:39.600]  They didn't expect this to happen. If they censored Bigfoot, we would all be believing in
[2:50:39.600 --> 2:50:45.600]  Bigfoot right now. Right. See, their, their plan is backfiring. Their censoring is driving people
[2:50:45.600 --> 2:50:50.720]  to the truth and they're finding the truth. Whether it's their neighbor that watches band
[2:50:50.720 --> 2:50:57.360]  out video or reading the Gateway Pundit or any of the revolver, they're finding the truth because
[2:50:57.360 --> 2:51:00.960]  it just doesn't make any sense. If it's not true, then why are we censoring it? Well,
[2:51:00.960 --> 2:51:04.480]  what do we expect to see happen next? Because we can see all those are right away. I think
[2:51:04.480 --> 2:51:07.600]  things are great, but they got a lot of curveballs. What do you think is going to happen next?
[2:51:07.600 --> 2:51:12.320]  I think one of the things that's going to happen next is we have curveballs. The curveball is in
[2:51:12.320 --> 2:51:18.400]  the fact that we're going, nah, that's not cool. Five years ago, a dude from a high school dropout
[2:51:18.400 --> 2:51:22.800]  from urban America saying, hey, I'm going to go on Alex's show. I'm going to be talking to a green
[2:51:22.800 --> 2:51:27.200]  beret and we're going to be communicating about higher enlightenment. We're going to be communicating
[2:51:27.200 --> 2:51:32.000]  about unity. We're going to, that would have been unheard of. The curveball is in the fact that
[2:51:32.000 --> 2:51:36.880]  we're collectively going to that plank scale. Those groups of people are now bubbling up into
[2:51:36.880 --> 2:51:41.920]  consciousness. That's our curveball. I do believe that they're going to try something extreme
[2:51:41.920 --> 2:51:48.000]  to knock us off of our square. We have to stand on our square and maintain the position. We are
[2:51:48.000 --> 2:51:53.600]  winning. We are winning. I give it a more practical example. A lot of people say, oh, the gun rights,
[2:51:53.600 --> 2:51:58.480]  you're losing your gun rights to a certain extent. Over the last 20 years, we have had more licenses
[2:51:58.480 --> 2:52:05.520]  to carry, right? And violent crime across America has decreased. Out of that has come all the other
[2:52:05.520 --> 2:52:11.120]  things of prepping and gardening and we just get more powerful every day. People now get,
[2:52:11.120 --> 2:52:16.080]  we've got to get ready. We can't trust the system. Right. And it's that idea. Once you throw it loose
[2:52:16.080 --> 2:52:21.520]  and make that rock star, not your plan to rock star gathering, but you're building a farm,
[2:52:21.520 --> 2:52:27.120]  employing people, feeding people. That's the future. Yeah. And we have to continue to maneuver
[2:52:27.120 --> 2:52:33.600]  on the enemy. Keep moving, keep speaking out. And I talk to people all over and they're like,
[2:52:33.600 --> 2:52:36.640]  man, I'm starting to do this. I say, you know, we have a saying in the military,
[2:52:36.640 --> 2:52:42.720]  always keep improving your fighting position. Every day that you have, make it better because
[2:52:42.720 --> 2:52:48.640]  the battle may never come. But when it does come, the condition of your fighting position at that
[2:52:48.640 --> 2:52:53.040]  time is what's going to keep you alive. What about not getting the military with suicide
[2:52:53.040 --> 2:52:57.120]  because they feel worthless? We need all those people to enjoy themselves, you know,
[2:52:57.120 --> 2:53:00.960]  the fighting is tyranny, expend themselves on that, not blowing their head off. Well,
[2:53:00.960 --> 2:53:06.000]  when we talk about this in the break, we could never have this deep of a conversation on an
[2:53:06.000 --> 2:53:10.560]  electronic device. That right. So that's what we need to do. We need to reconnect with each other.
[2:53:10.560 --> 2:53:15.200]  We need to shake hands and hug and break bread. That's something that Brandon Gray said the other
[2:53:15.200 --> 2:53:19.360]  night we stayed at his house. He's like, man, we're breaking bread. I hadn't heard that in forever.
[2:53:19.360 --> 2:53:23.840]  But see, that's what we used to do, right? The dinner table. Invite your neighbor over.
[2:53:23.840 --> 2:53:28.160]  Don't talk about politics. Talk about your garden. And these are the things that if we
[2:53:28.160 --> 2:53:32.080]  watch the enemy, we can see that these are the things that they want to snatch away. That's right.
[2:53:32.080 --> 2:53:36.560]  Don't stand too close to each other. Don't destroy the human connection. It's so obvious.
[2:53:36.560 --> 2:53:41.520]  I'm going to do the coming together. Right. Right. Act like a teenage girl and do opposite
[2:53:41.520 --> 2:53:46.560]  of what they do. Right. Right. And these are the things that the American spirit is doing.
[2:53:46.560 --> 2:53:51.040]  We're like you said, we're seeing it. We're seeing massive amounts of people. Guys like Ian Smith,
[2:53:51.040 --> 2:53:54.640]  the general over. Hold my hand. Let's hold hands. Let's do it. They don't want this right now.
[2:53:54.640 --> 2:53:59.600]  You see this new old order, right? You failed right here. Right. Humanity is together. We love
[2:53:59.600 --> 2:54:03.760]  Jesus. We love God. We're going to win. We're together. That's right. You see that Satan?
[2:54:03.760 --> 2:54:07.760]  We are together right now. They cannot stand that image of human enlightenment,
[2:54:07.760 --> 2:54:11.840]  human connection. They hate it. Alex, I think to help departments outside, they're violating
[2:54:11.840 --> 2:54:16.320]  COVID regulations. Let them be. Let them be. No, that's what it's all about. And they hate that.
[2:54:16.320 --> 2:54:20.400]  Right. Because now we're connected. Now we have the same destiny. Now we're going to the future
[2:54:20.400 --> 2:54:24.160]  together. And no matter we're not physically connected, we're spurs to connect right now.
[2:54:24.160 --> 2:54:28.960]  That's right. Yeah. And that's what we need to do. We need to connect in the real world.
[2:54:28.960 --> 2:54:33.600]  See, I don't know if the viewers can see this, but Alex has had tears in his eyes for like the
[2:54:33.600 --> 2:54:38.960]  last hour. And, you know, it's uncomfortable for me. I'm a man. I know when a man is crying that
[2:54:38.960 --> 2:54:45.760]  it's serious, right? And this is what's going on. Again, I don't like to lecture people. I'm a very
[2:54:45.760 --> 2:54:49.920]  private person, but because of the globalists and their attack on humanity, I've been forced
[2:54:49.920 --> 2:54:54.480]  the last 27 years to be a public figure. And we've given the globalists one hell of a run for their
[2:54:54.480 --> 2:54:59.520]  money because of God. And I know some of our listeners get mad when I talk about God all day,
[2:54:59.520 --> 2:55:03.440]  but just give me a break. The Satanism's out in the open. I've always been a Christian, but
[2:55:03.440 --> 2:55:07.760]  now the fact that it's a fight between good and evil is so clear. And I get it. A lot of you've
[2:55:07.760 --> 2:55:13.280]  been turned off by big churches. A lot of you've been turned off by the corrupt priest class system.
[2:55:13.280 --> 2:55:18.640]  And I get it. Me too. Believe me, I'm one of them. But it's that relationship with God and just
[2:55:18.640 --> 2:55:24.960]  God's universe that God created that is so essential. And God created the universe for us
[2:55:24.960 --> 2:55:28.960]  to have communion with God through and to have life. And so that's what infill wars is really
[2:55:28.960 --> 2:55:32.480]  all about. So thank you all for your word of mouth. Thank you for spreading the word about
[2:55:32.480 --> 2:55:37.200]  infill wars. And thank you for supporting us to keep us on air by visiting infillwarstore.com.
[2:55:37.200 --> 2:55:40.880]  Because without your daily and weekly monthly purchases, we'll be taken off the air.
[2:55:40.880 --> 2:55:49.440]  So thank you for the support. Infillwarstore.com Gerald of South Carolina. Go ahead. You're on the
[2:55:49.440 --> 2:55:51.280]  air trying to move quicker. Hey, Alex. Welcome. Would like to say first off, thanks for being the
[2:55:51.280 --> 2:55:55.840]  voice of reason and amongst all this stupidity wanted to warn people I've been trying to get
[2:55:55.840 --> 2:56:02.240]  ahold of you for a year. Okay. I'm a double amputee and I have bacteria infection on my
[2:56:02.240 --> 2:56:08.560]  lung that'll never go away. Living defense saved my life. They had me on antibiotics for two years
[2:56:08.560 --> 2:56:14.080]  that almost killed me. Living defense brought me back. I wanted to just quote from the Bible,
[2:56:14.080 --> 2:56:20.400]  Jesus is saying as to where we are right now. This is Matthew 24 verse nine. Then they shall
[2:56:20.400 --> 2:56:27.920]  deliver you up to be afflicted and shall kill you and you shall be hated of all nations for my
[2:56:27.920 --> 2:56:33.840]  names sake. And then shall many be offended and shall betray one another and shall hate one
[2:56:33.840 --> 2:56:38.720]  another. Right where we're at, brother. And that's because God's name is on the founding of this
[2:56:38.720 --> 2:56:43.520]  country, no matter what they say. And that's why the enemy hates it because God created this country.
[2:56:47.920 --> 2:56:50.560]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:56:50.560 --> 2:57:01.520]  Jeremy Brown and Maz Du Ray final segment ahead of Stuart Peters.
[2:57:02.080 --> 2:57:07.440]  Taken over. No, there's no tears in my eyes. Humanity coming together. The zeitgeist. I
[2:57:07.440 --> 2:57:12.800]  always feel it. And now things are so intense. So in closing gentlemen, what is the zeitgeist?
[2:57:12.800 --> 2:57:18.640]  Where are we right now? We're in a place of beauty. We're in a place of the balance. The person that
[2:57:18.640 --> 2:57:24.720]  may be a little more so-called pessimistic as a caution. The person that's tremendously optimistic
[2:57:24.720 --> 2:57:30.240]  as hope and balanced in between. You're talking about something that is balanced. We're cautious
[2:57:30.240 --> 2:57:34.880]  enough. You know, my friends say things like, you know, trust God, but tie your camel. Right?
[2:57:34.880 --> 2:57:39.280]  There's a balance there. It's like, yo, I'm not dumb, but I'm also trusting. That's the place
[2:57:39.280 --> 2:57:44.720]  that we are right now. And that feeling that we're having right now is that bubbling up of that.
[2:57:44.720 --> 2:57:49.600]  And there's an outside attack against humanity driving us together. Right. Our souls saying,
[2:57:49.600 --> 2:57:54.000]  this is what we should do. Right. Well, yeah. And I was telling you in a break, Alex, that I hear
[2:57:54.000 --> 2:57:58.720]  you saying the same thing. I want to run for the hills. I want to get my family, get in the RV,
[2:57:58.720 --> 2:58:03.360]  and go high because we'll survive. Yeah. Right. We'll survive. People like us will survive.
[2:58:03.360 --> 2:58:09.120]  But yet we can't pull the trigger on that. And the reason is because we're where we are because
[2:58:09.120 --> 2:58:14.560]  we're supposed to be here. We were built this way. You were built your way to do what you're doing.
[2:58:14.560 --> 2:58:20.480]  Right. Right. I have my knowledge and skill set because I'm built for this time. Right. And no
[2:58:20.480 --> 2:58:25.680]  matter what my selfish desires are, right when I make the decision, that's it. Screw these people.
[2:58:25.680 --> 2:58:30.560]  They can spin for themselves. I get an email from a 70 year old woman saying, thank God that you're
[2:58:30.560 --> 2:58:35.600]  out there fighting because I can't. Right. Right. And it just, it's like bringing it home. Right.
[2:58:35.600 --> 2:58:42.320]  Like that, that's, that's the spirit or whatever you want to call it is, is confirming that what
[2:58:42.320 --> 2:58:49.120]  you're doing is the right thing. Their prayers have enlisted you. Right. Their prayers have enlisted
[2:58:49.120 --> 2:58:55.360]  you. It's, it's really that connection being reconnected. It's that again, we're all the same
[2:58:55.360 --> 2:58:59.920]  stuff. It's that tentacle re reaching back and informing that form of connection. But the question
[2:58:59.920 --> 2:59:05.040]  is why is it so intense right now? It's intense right now because it's like right before the
[2:59:05.040 --> 2:59:12.000]  expansion. It's, it's when there's a woman giving birth, the time in between contractions is longer
[2:59:12.000 --> 2:59:17.120]  until the baby gets there. That time in between contractions, contracts like everything in the
[2:59:17.120 --> 2:59:21.520]  universe expansion and contraction and they get more painful and they get more painful.
[2:59:21.520 --> 2:59:26.160]  And you did, you had a little bit more time in between the pain. Where have you heard this before?
[2:59:26.160 --> 2:59:33.200]  As the pain becomes closer and closer and closer, you give birth to something beautiful. It's almost
[2:59:33.200 --> 2:59:41.040]  like there's a book that describes these times using the birth pain finale. So what do we do?
[2:59:41.040 --> 2:59:45.440]  Because we got to guest those taken over in closing 60 seconds of peace. What do we do?
[2:59:46.640 --> 2:59:53.120]  We fight. We stay aware and we be prepared and we unite with those who're going to help us get
[2:59:53.120 --> 2:59:57.920]  through the fight. I mean, don't give up. Never give up. And we thank God that we're not Chuckie
[2:59:57.920 --> 3:00:08.080]  Schumer and, and, and what's that guy's name? Evil always suffers and they're going to get what
[3:00:08.080 --> 3:00:11.840]  is coming to them. For me, for me, what it is and what it looks like for me is just
[3:00:11.840 --> 3:00:16.320]  staying on top and on the physical plane, making sure that you're supporting shows like this,
[3:00:16.320 --> 3:00:20.640]  the work that you're doing, the companies that are getting behind this because they see it,
[3:00:20.640 --> 3:00:24.160]  as well as making sure that on the physical realm, we're defending ourselves,
[3:00:24.160 --> 3:00:28.400]  organizations like ours, Black Guns Matter. I want everybody to come out to the Solutionary Summit.
[3:00:28.400 --> 3:00:35.120]  Come learn, engage with people that have a basis of solutions. This is how we win.
[3:00:35.120 --> 3:00:39.920]  It's beautiful. So people find that where SolutionaryLifestyle.org.
[3:00:39.920 --> 3:00:43.040]  What do they find your great work, my friend? Well, I don't really have any great work,
[3:00:43.040 --> 3:00:47.440]  but you can email me at GGSOL at proton mail that stands for great. Well,
[3:00:47.440 --> 3:00:52.640]  you expose the feds and that's pretty good work. Great. Right. And I do have a Gibson Go to take
[3:00:52.640 --> 3:00:58.080]  on the Washington Post for defaming combat veterans. And you can find that at GibsonGo.com
[3:00:58.080 --> 3:01:05.440]  slash combatvets.v as in versus the WAPO. All right. Stu Peters is about to take over.
[3:01:05.440 --> 3:01:08.960]  We're going to get some Texas barbecue, which is not a good North Carolina barbecue.
[3:01:10.400 --> 3:01:15.120]  That's what I say. No, it's all good. Actually, I thought Tennessee and North Carolina barbecue.
[3:01:15.120 --> 3:01:18.240]  It's all good. Neither one of those are better than Philly Cheesesteak. We're just going to eat
[3:01:18.240 --> 3:01:22.320]  meat so that we make sure that we don't let the global philly cheesesteaks. Great stuff.
[3:01:22.320 --> 3:01:26.160]  All right. I feel empowered. I love this crew. Thank you to the great crew for what they've
[3:01:26.160 --> 3:01:30.000]  done. Stu Peters takes over right now and then I'm going to take some big shows
[3:01:31.440 --> 3:01:37.680]  coming up for Saturday this, this weekend, 4 p.m. Central Standard Time. So give me a few
[3:01:37.680 --> 3:01:41.440]  minutes because I got Max Kaiser up to take for tomorrow. All right. That's it for this
[3:01:41.440 --> 3:01:51.040]  transmission. All right. Thanks a lot, Alex. Thank you.

[3:03:08.160 --> 3:03:13.440]  It's more like a fire hydrant now is these waterfalls of proof and these mountainous
[3:03:13.440 --> 3:03:22.080]  piles of information and evidence become exposed. The term fight back, all this fight back stuff
[3:03:22.080 --> 3:03:27.680]  that we keep on talking about, it doesn't have to be like if you fight back, you're on the defensive
[3:03:27.680 --> 3:03:32.720]  and it is time for us now to go on the defensive to take this information that we have because the
[3:03:32.720 --> 3:03:38.320]  takeover is on and these globalists will absolutely stop at nothing to complete their mission and
[3:03:38.320 --> 3:03:43.120]  they know that they're running out of time. It's Stu Peters from stupeters.tv here, happy to be
[3:03:43.120 --> 3:03:48.240]  with you on this final hour of the Alex Jones show every Friday. It is really truly an honor to spend
[3:03:48.240 --> 3:03:54.080]  my Friday afternoons with you but I am closely in contact with people who are at the highest
[3:03:54.080 --> 3:03:58.400]  levels of government, people both in the government and the private sector, people in the military
[3:03:58.960 --> 3:04:03.520]  and I have conversations with these people. Now we have a lot of stuff to break here today
[3:04:03.520 --> 3:04:09.040]  and a very short amount of time to do it so stick with me for this hour because we're going to try
[3:04:09.040 --> 3:04:14.720]  to jam it all in here. I was texting last night and I was texting last night I'm going to protect
[3:04:14.720 --> 3:04:21.040]  this person's anonymity but I was asking this person whether or not Trump lost his military
[3:04:21.040 --> 3:04:27.280]  support and what I was referring to was Trump losing his military support before January 20th.
[3:04:28.160 --> 3:04:33.680]  What this person thought I was referring to was whether or not Trump had military support
[3:04:33.680 --> 3:04:40.400]  to run originally in 2016. So we kind of got a little bit mixed up but Trump's closest advisors,
[3:04:40.960 --> 3:04:46.800]  what you need to understand, a lot of people ask why did Trump just walk away? Why didn't he do
[3:04:46.800 --> 3:04:54.080]  anything with section 230? Why does he continue to promote these jabs? You have to stop thinking
[3:04:54.080 --> 3:05:00.160]  about this in a light of you and your individual family and how this impacts you because you have
[3:05:00.160 --> 3:05:04.960]  to make these decisions based on the information that you have. Whether or not you go out and get
[3:05:04.960 --> 3:05:09.520]  inoculated with this poison that we have now exposed as a bio weapon, I don't know why you
[3:05:09.520 --> 3:05:16.720]  would ever do that to yourself and you should be at the top of every hill in your town standing on
[3:05:16.720 --> 3:05:21.680]  top of the highest roof anywhere and grabbing the loudest bullhorn you have and going everywhere
[3:05:21.680 --> 3:05:26.480]  that you possibly can and warning everybody exactly what this thing is. That is your patriotic duty
[3:05:26.480 --> 3:05:31.040]  to your brothers and sisters in Christ and to your fellow Americans and really global citizens
[3:05:31.040 --> 3:05:36.080]  as this thing is not just an effort here in the United States but Fauci and Gates and the global
[3:05:36.080 --> 3:05:42.320]  cabal has a concerted effort all the way around the world to try to incapacitate you. Now I used
[3:05:42.320 --> 3:05:46.800]  to say this was the plan for depopulation and they're going to kill you. Well in a certain respect
[3:05:46.800 --> 3:05:53.200]  that is true but being the most rich or the most powerful man on the face of the planet with nobody
[3:05:53.200 --> 3:05:58.400]  else on it but you seems kind of meaningless. So really what this is is about subservience.
[3:05:58.400 --> 3:06:03.840]  They want to reign and control and as we see this inoculation continue to roll out and more
[3:06:03.840 --> 3:06:10.480]  quote-unquote variants coming we have this delta BS now that more fear mongering by these satanist
[3:06:10.480 --> 3:06:15.440]  globalists as we see this thing progress and more people get inoculated what we're going to end up
[3:06:15.440 --> 3:06:21.120]  with is we're going to end up with teenagers 15 years old 20 years old 25 years old suffering
[3:06:21.120 --> 3:06:28.320]  with dementia being physically incapacitated and that's going to require you to support these people
[3:06:28.320 --> 3:06:32.720]  and insurance is not going to cover it we already know that because these people have already said
[3:06:32.720 --> 3:06:38.400]  everybody that takes this thing is part of an experiment this is a this is a trial and so you're
[3:06:38.400 --> 3:06:42.800]  not going to be covered by your insurance companies you're not going to be able to go after Moderna
[3:06:42.800 --> 3:06:47.040]  not after Pfizer Johnson Johnson AstraZeneca or anybody else that wants to put their hands in
[3:06:47.040 --> 3:06:53.120]  the pot so Trump's closest advisors had cut him off from the military and military support before
[3:06:53.120 --> 3:06:59.280]  January 20th now he sent cash over to the Pentagon to have another avenue of contact with the military
[3:06:59.280 --> 3:07:05.840]  but they cut that off as well so his position and his control and his support by the military
[3:07:05.840 --> 3:07:10.240]  was very much unknown at the time that he left and this is coming from somebody who is directly
[3:07:11.840 --> 3:07:16.640]  I don't want to say associated with but right in the middle of all of it this is a very reliable
[3:07:16.640 --> 3:07:24.080]  source who I have vetted who I deemed to be a hundred percent credible now I'm in close contact
[3:07:24.080 --> 3:07:29.280]  with a source that I trust tremendously and again I'm going to protect the anonymity of that person
[3:07:29.280 --> 3:07:34.320]  that I was exchanging these text messages with last evening but I want to illustrate for you how
[3:07:34.320 --> 3:07:41.680]  realistic a return to office is for President Trump and why he just walked away it's my opinion
[3:07:41.680 --> 3:07:49.600]  that Donald J. Trump is the ultimate white hat and while others are disputing or pontificating
[3:07:49.600 --> 3:07:54.080]  or shedding their opinions around social media and the twitter sphere and everywhere else that
[3:07:54.080 --> 3:07:59.200]  it's fake about the reason why he left or why he didn't act on 230 and why he continues to push the
[3:07:59.200 --> 3:08:05.040]  jab it's my thought process to look at this at a reality from Trump's perspective in a time of war
[3:08:05.040 --> 3:08:09.920]  because that is where we are if it's not completely evident to you Joe Biden just told you today that
[3:08:09.920 --> 3:08:16.240]  he's going to nuke you if you should put up any resistance to his globalist takeover so I want
[3:08:16.240 --> 3:08:20.000]  to refer you to one of the first text messages that I received that I thought would be appropriate
[3:08:20.000 --> 3:08:24.480]  for you guys to look at today that I'm protecting the anonymity of this person but he said when I
[3:08:24.480 --> 3:08:29.360]  was asking about Trump's military support he said I thought you meant military support to run for
[3:08:29.360 --> 3:08:37.360]  president if you met the January 20th time period again his closest advisors had cut him off from
[3:08:37.360 --> 3:08:43.280]  the military and the military support he sent cash over to the Pentagon to have another avenue of
[3:08:43.280 --> 3:08:47.760]  contact with the military but they cut that off as well so his position and control and support of
[3:08:47.760 --> 3:08:52.560]  the military was very much unknown at the time that he left so think about that think about
[3:08:52.560 --> 3:08:58.400]  exactly what that means if Trump doesn't have the support of the military at that time if he
[3:08:58.400 --> 3:09:04.320]  doesn't really know how much support he has we've already been told that top military commanders
[3:09:04.320 --> 3:09:08.320]  denied his request for military presence to be there on the 6th of January that was part of
[3:09:08.320 --> 3:09:12.160]  the setup that was on purpose the military could not be there as a matter of fact they had to act
[3:09:12.160 --> 3:09:17.280]  against him and the only people that could do that were the top commanders and in this in the
[3:09:17.280 --> 3:09:22.640]  next segment we're going to get into exactly who it was that was responsible for that so I mentioned
[3:09:22.640 --> 3:09:28.720]  to this source that is close to the situation who again I trust indefinitely I mentioned to him
[3:09:28.720 --> 3:09:34.320]  that it appeared to me and here I go with my tin foil hat conspiracy theories but it listen I worked
[3:09:34.320 --> 3:09:40.640]  in the private sector of law enforcement for almost two decades I chased very wanted very violent
[3:09:40.640 --> 3:09:46.960]  people wanted for crimes against persons and I jailed them for 18 years very successfully I'm
[3:09:46.960 --> 3:09:53.520]  a trained observer and being the trained observer that I am I have seen Joe Biden out here speaking
[3:09:53.520 --> 3:09:58.880]  it appears to me that he's wearing a ballistic vest I take that to believe that they're expecting
[3:09:58.880 --> 3:10:03.120]  something to happen if something is going to happen it's going to come within his camp I know
[3:10:03.120 --> 3:10:08.240]  that and it's not above these people to take a shot at him it's not above these people to put
[3:10:08.240 --> 3:10:13.360]  him on his back and then you know who they're going to blame white supremacist Trump supporter
[3:10:13.360 --> 3:10:20.160]  anti-vaxxer you know us so I asked him about this and he said this I'll put the text on the
[3:10:20.160 --> 3:10:26.000]  screen here I haven't heard anything about killing him Biden but I did hear that after Biden takes
[3:10:26.000 --> 3:10:32.720]  away all the guns or introduces legislation seriously restricting them that Kamala is going
[3:10:32.720 --> 3:10:38.960]  to come on strong and remove him or he'll take a bow out for health reasons but he's on his way out
[3:10:40.160 --> 3:10:45.760]  so if you if you are still able to screw around on Twitter if you're still over there you might
[3:10:45.760 --> 3:10:51.360]  know who John here to help is his name is Dr. John McGreevy and he actually wrote about this months
[3:10:51.360 --> 3:10:57.440]  ago and basically essentially what he came to the conclusion of is what we talk about here all the
[3:10:57.440 --> 3:11:03.920]  time is that Biden is a Trojan horse he'll sign anything that is put in front of him so they'll
[3:11:03.920 --> 3:11:10.800]  use him to sign and enact the most restrictive legislation especially when it comes to gun
[3:11:10.800 --> 3:11:17.200]  control that way when she comes in when Kamala comes in she can look like the voice of reason
[3:11:17.200 --> 3:11:21.840]  despite the fact that Kamala Harris is quite possibly the most radical progressive ever to
[3:11:21.840 --> 3:11:26.800]  occupy a senate seat she'll still look like the voice of reason as compared to what they're making
[3:11:26.800 --> 3:11:32.800]  Joe Biden do now these globalist handlers that have propped him up and put him there
[3:11:32.800 --> 3:11:40.400]  against the will of the majority of Americans and so she's taking the middle road right now
[3:11:40.400 --> 3:11:46.160]  she's sort of the deal maker as that's how they'll present this is that she's working with both sides
[3:11:46.880 --> 3:11:52.960]  so it's a way to cut down on her radical image but still get what they want and this was being
[3:11:52.960 --> 3:11:58.240]  telegraphed it's right out in the wide open over at stupeeters.tv today we publish an article
[3:11:58.240 --> 3:12:03.280]  specifically about this there are very sneaky maneuvers being performed by Kamala but they're
[3:12:03.280 --> 3:12:09.520]  not sneaky at all she's being caught at every turn now we're going to break all kinds of extremely
[3:12:09.520 --> 3:12:14.320]  important pieces of information over the course of this next hour i've got about 30 seconds left
[3:12:14.320 --> 3:12:19.040]  here but you need to listen you need to carefully pay attention we know the virus was engineered

[3:12:23.520 --> 3:12:28.240]  how they orchestrated everything but until just yesterday we didn't know specifically who it was
[3:12:28.240 --> 3:12:34.240]  and now we do we know about a high ranking military general and how he denied trump's request for
[3:12:34.240 --> 3:12:39.280]  military assistance with security on the 6th but you guys this gets really really deep i'm going

[3:15:27.360 --> 3:15:31.840]  at info wars my name is stew peters at stew peters dot tv's where you can find me in my ear over the
[3:15:31.840 --> 3:15:38.000]  break i was reminded by one of the uh extremely intuitive attention to detail oriented trained
[3:15:38.000 --> 3:15:42.640]  observers here at info wars you know biden has brought this up in times past they have telegraphed
[3:15:42.640 --> 3:15:47.840]  this whole thing about dementia and you know remember six months ago when everybody looked at
[3:15:47.840 --> 3:15:52.800]  this guy like he was crazy when he said soon hospitals will be full of dementia patients
[3:15:52.800 --> 3:15:57.920]  and again he just said it just the other day uh if we're paying attention we don't have to be
[3:15:57.920 --> 3:16:04.240]  fighting back i we have to stop the fight back mantra get off of the defensive and get on the
[3:16:04.240 --> 3:16:10.080]  offensive we have to take the information that we have and get out on the offensive by exposing
[3:16:10.080 --> 3:16:14.240]  these people we're doing nothing but providing all of this exposure information and now it is time
[3:16:14.240 --> 3:16:19.920]  for people like senator ted cruise and senator rand paul to start acting on this information now
[3:16:20.560 --> 3:16:23.920]  i specifically mentioned to you guys that i had some tapes that i wanted to break
[3:16:24.720 --> 3:16:28.960]  some tapes that i was going to release to you about the exposure of people at the highest
[3:16:28.960 --> 3:16:34.240]  levels of government and this is the stuff that senator ted cruise specifically and rand paul
[3:16:34.240 --> 3:16:38.480]  should immediately act with their authority and use their offices to begin doing what they are there
[3:16:38.480 --> 3:16:44.800]  to do i spoke with john here to help that is dr john mcgrievey those of you that don't know he has
[3:16:44.800 --> 3:16:48.800]  been very plugged into the government and the military and information gathering on behalf
[3:16:48.800 --> 3:16:55.040]  of the government he is absolutely credible and he was on my show at stu peters dot tv
[3:16:55.040 --> 3:17:01.440]  just the other day and here's the tape now the thing is now there are FBI agents and federations
[3:17:01.440 --> 3:17:07.520]  all over january six they're all over the place and they were one of the persons who
[3:17:07.520 --> 3:17:14.080]  corroborated this was there they set this up they needed they needed a thing because everybody
[3:17:14.080 --> 3:17:20.640]  wanted to stand up and use this it's the same thing with the bombers that you know the bombs
[3:17:20.640 --> 3:17:26.080]  that were placed listen to this now and the FBI knows who they are because i'll put it right out
[3:17:26.080 --> 3:17:30.880]  here publicly i know who they are and i can tell you that the person who transported the bomber
[3:17:30.880 --> 3:17:38.800]  and the devices has a direct connection to the doj who is they're both taking orders who is it
[3:17:40.080 --> 3:17:48.080]  is related to a doj official do you want do you want to name these people not that one not yet
[3:17:48.960 --> 3:17:59.040]  but uh it is related to a very high ranking judge anyway so they know who they are but it's more
[3:17:59.040 --> 3:18:08.320]  valuable to them to keep them going oh this is a terrorist a white terrorist and there's a
[3:18:08.320 --> 3:18:12.400]  bomber out there so we have to keep our building closed i mean they're placing bombs they could
[3:18:12.400 --> 3:18:18.000]  be a victim they may know who it is they supplied the crappy devices didn't work but you know we
[3:18:18.000 --> 3:18:22.240]  have to keep boarding it up because there's a bomber out there we can't find them they know who
[3:18:22.240 --> 3:18:30.880]  they are i got a picture of my phone so they know all this and it's just to keep me going now
[3:18:31.920 --> 3:18:36.720]  closing in this mastermind and stuff really stepped out from behind the curtain to do this
[3:18:36.720 --> 3:18:42.640]  knowing she works through pathways and she did to an extent on this one but she didn't trust
[3:18:42.640 --> 3:18:47.760]  anybody to get it right she even called in the orders to get someone to sacrifice now if you
[3:18:47.760 --> 3:18:52.400]  get these video tapes you'll see them going around questioning people leaving them they were leaving
[3:18:52.400 --> 3:18:56.640]  other people up to the stairs and they didn't go that far because you know they were whatever
[3:18:56.640 --> 3:19:00.640]  scared them they felt something was wrong they just backed off went the other way they'll see
[3:19:00.640 --> 3:19:06.880]  these on there they finally got something up there it's bad and you'll see the shooter and
[3:19:06.880 --> 3:19:11.520]  you can actually see in the video watch it as i described you'll see him move forward back off
[3:19:11.520 --> 3:19:16.320]  move forward back off because he's accepting his orders who is it that one that one and
[3:19:16.320 --> 3:19:19.840]  live people had to face this cover these like that so he won the sure who is male who's female
[3:19:19.840 --> 3:19:24.000]  he had to get an identification of who to shoot there's a video recording that's because
[3:19:24.560 --> 3:19:28.400]  you know who he was talking to we know who he was talking to through you could not use the
[3:19:28.400 --> 3:19:34.080]  normal communication systems because the officers were all over the place and there are people who
[3:19:34.080 --> 3:19:40.000]  regularly the community reporters but just general citizens listen to police scholars and listen to
[3:19:40.000 --> 3:19:45.440]  the capital police find out what's going on get tidbits and whatever okay they know this just
[3:19:45.440 --> 3:19:49.280]  how they get tips so you couldn't be talking through there you couldn't have somebody say on
[3:19:49.280 --> 3:19:55.760]  the radio shoot it'd be way too obvious they also wanted to protect their phones and their
[3:19:55.760 --> 3:20:01.360]  transcripts they have guys taking all those but their text messages things like that so they were
[3:20:01.360 --> 3:20:10.640]  using military encrypted communications the one who helped set this up the person who provided
[3:20:10.640 --> 3:20:18.400]  a lot of this closely did not want the guy coming into her house you have to come into her house
[3:20:19.200 --> 3:20:24.640]  and do this and mess it up because that's her house and that's how she refers to her doing
[3:20:24.640 --> 3:20:31.680]  her house she's in charge she has her own little secret Gestapo police force and they take the
[3:20:31.680 --> 3:20:39.120]  orders however they're using I guess I'm military communications at the time and they were provided
[3:20:39.120 --> 3:20:49.520]  by a certain person this person was rewarded for what was done they helped set everything up
[3:20:49.520 --> 3:20:58.000]  this is the same person who had a duty to protect everything again because I've been saying to Trump
[3:20:58.000 --> 3:21:04.400]  and because he saw a way to get inside and I'm putting this out there because I'm relying on
[3:21:04.400 --> 3:21:11.600]  this person's honor it's a duty to come forward so you're not going to name this person I'm going
[3:21:11.600 --> 3:21:19.840]  to name this one I would tell you this I would like to speak to him now I understand your hands
[3:21:19.840 --> 3:21:25.440]  with your entire dear opinion but you swung out the same one many of us have more than once
[3:21:27.440 --> 3:21:32.880]  you were paid off okay you got your ticket in the inside but you're not you're not as safe as you
[3:21:32.880 --> 3:21:40.400]  think you are you are a connection between what happened in January 6th as fake as it is and the
[3:21:40.400 --> 3:21:47.840]  federal agencies and Pelosi you are not that's immediately untied okay you have to think of that
[3:21:48.560 --> 3:21:53.360]  and you know how these people are you don't know the extent of it he's playing in the league he's
[3:21:53.360 --> 3:22:05.120]  not used to so I'm speaking to Major General William Walker the commander of the U.S. National Guard in
[3:22:05.120 --> 3:22:14.320]  D.C. and the brand-new the promoted Sergeant and Arms promoted by Nancy Pelosi so in general
[3:22:15.040 --> 3:22:20.080]  I would never attack our military I would never be smirched some of the wears in uniform especially
[3:22:20.080 --> 3:22:28.240]  a general officer I'm asking you sir please stand up and defend us as you have done in the past
[3:22:29.360 --> 3:22:37.920]  it's going to come out I have heard that all of your private and social communications
[3:22:38.640 --> 3:22:43.280]  email text phone calls or they have been archived for a while over the past year
[3:22:43.280 --> 3:22:49.600]  so I would call you sir to do your duty and come out and defend us once more
[3:22:51.360 --> 3:22:55.760]  while you can't you don't realize the level that these people will go to to protect what they have
[3:23:06.160 --> 3:23:10.240]  the thing is now there are FBI agents and federal agencies all over
[3:23:10.240 --> 3:23:16.320]  January 6th they're all over the place and they were one of the persons who corroborated this was
[3:23:16.320 --> 3:23:24.480]  there they set this up they needed a thing because everybody wanted to stand up and use this
[3:23:25.200 --> 3:23:29.280]  it's the same thing with the bombers that you know the the bombs that were placed
[3:23:30.480 --> 3:23:35.360]  and the FBI knows who they are because I'll put it right out here publicly I know who they are
[3:23:35.360 --> 3:23:39.680]  and I can tell you that the person who transported the bomber and the devices
[3:23:40.560 --> 3:23:47.360]  that's a direct connection to the DHS who isn't taking orders we'll have more on this coming up
[3:23:47.360 --> 3:23:50.720]  next dealing with some difficulties we'll be right back on the Alex Jones show scientific
[3:23:50.720 --> 3:23:56.160]  dictatorship that I've been warning you about for 27 years has now gone for beta testing to
[3:23:56.160 --> 3:24:01.760]  operational the globalists are out of the open with their planetary depopulation takeover their
[3:24:01.760 --> 3:24:06.160]  robot takeover but the good news is we've been working and you've been working and others have
[3:24:06.160 --> 3:24:10.640]  been working across the planet for decades to get ready for this to be able to find it off
[3:24:10.640 --> 3:24:15.600]  humanity is strong we're incredible and if we're aware of the attack that's happening we have a
[3:24:15.600 --> 3:24:20.800]  real chance of defeating it if we ask god for guidance we will defeat it so prayer is essential
[3:24:20.800 --> 3:24:25.840]  research is essential getting prepared is essential and warning others is absolutely essential and at
[3:24:25.840 --> 3:24:31.200]  the same time supporting info wars by buying high quality products to keep us on air is essential
[3:24:31.200 --> 3:24:35.360]  because they're great products for you and your family and they're also funding our operation
[3:24:35.360 --> 3:24:41.760]  infowarstore.com infowarstore.com is incredible a lot of our products that have been sold out

[3:25:05.520 --> 3:25:11.040]  there that may have spent a lifetime in the sun like me i was loaded up with sunspots or age spots
[3:25:11.040 --> 3:25:16.880]  as they're lovingly called but since taking your x2 for the last couple of years my skin is just
[3:25:16.880 --> 3:25:23.520]  really gorgeous actually people think i'm 55 years old and i was already taking your other
[3:25:23.520 --> 3:25:28.240]  supplements but i thought you know well maybe that's what i need to do because i just thought it was a
[3:25:28.240 --> 3:25:33.760]  hopeless situation but when i started taking it it doesn't happen immediately but you know over a
[3:25:33.760 --> 3:25:40.080]  period of time i started noticing okay you know this is a ticket this is working this is wonderful
[3:25:40.080 --> 3:25:46.880]  you know i don't i don't have to put on derma blend anymore you know so anyway it works wonderfully
[3:25:46.880 --> 3:25:53.760]  and it really has totally cleared up my skin you know it's crazy to get to this point it's very
[3:25:53.760 --> 3:25:58.480]  bittersweet everything we've talked about has happened just like we said it would and now we
[3:25:58.480 --> 3:26:01.680]  have a lot of credibility but i don't care about that i care about beating the new world order
[3:26:02.320 --> 3:26:06.960]  and it's because we have so much credibility they can't allow us to stay on air much longer
[3:26:06.960 --> 3:26:10.800]  and i don't have time to tell you all the stuff they're doing to us for a lot of reasons i can't
[3:26:10.800 --> 3:26:14.800]  tell you what's going on but let's just say this we're going to see this through the end

[3:26:34.160 --> 3:26:38.720]  looking for truth that's why the globalists are censoring they can't bring in all this tyranny

[3:27:50.240 --> 3:28:06.160]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[3:28:10.720 --> 3:28:15.360]  it's one of the frustrations of being a guest host we have technical difficulties that last
[3:28:15.360 --> 3:28:22.880]  segment i really really hope that you paid very close attention to this not only has the bomber
[3:28:22.880 --> 3:28:29.200]  been identified the fbi knows who it was that transported these bombs who transported the
[3:28:29.200 --> 3:28:38.160]  bombers there are pictures of these people now the current congressional sergeant at arms promoted
[3:28:38.160 --> 3:28:47.120]  by nancy polosi former major general william j. walker has been implicated in orchestrating the
[3:28:47.120 --> 3:28:54.640]  execution of ashley babbitt by providing to nancy polosi at her request encrypted military grade
[3:28:54.640 --> 3:29:05.440]  communications now i don't know why dr john mcgrievey specifically named senator ran paul
[3:29:05.440 --> 3:29:14.320]  and senator ted cruise as who he wants to be aware of this information but that is who he
[3:29:14.320 --> 3:29:22.640]  is calling on to act and act now knowing this information see william j. walker is in a very
[3:29:22.640 --> 3:29:29.920]  precarious position right now we saw what happened to jeffrey epstein we saw what happened to john
[3:29:29.920 --> 3:29:37.280]  mcafee if if they're dead this is really where we're at right now and if they want to get rid
[3:29:37.280 --> 3:29:43.200]  of major general william j. walker he means nothing to them anymore his job has already been done he
[3:29:43.200 --> 3:29:56.400]  did to ignore donald j trump's request for the military and then went so far as to be an active
[3:29:56.400 --> 3:30:04.640]  participant in setting up trump supporters who are now being jailed imprisoned put in solitary
[3:30:04.640 --> 3:30:11.040]  confinement being targeted by the weaponized fbi and this guy is stuck right between nancy polosi
[3:30:11.040 --> 3:30:19.200]  and the fbi that's unbelievable stuff now it is not my job to determine whether or not a whistle
[3:30:19.200 --> 3:30:25.280]  blower is telling the truth that is not my job i'm not the judge i'm not the jury my job is to
[3:30:25.280 --> 3:30:31.360]  determine the credibility of whistleblowers and i not only do i believe that dr john mcgreevy is a
[3:30:31.360 --> 3:30:38.640]  credible whistleblower but i also do believe that he is telling the truth so take that information
[3:30:38.640 --> 3:30:45.360]  and become on the offensive no more is fight back we're not on the defense anymore we are on the
[3:30:45.360 --> 3:30:52.480]  offense and we are the majority so in saying that i went to this other person that i was texting
[3:30:52.480 --> 3:30:57.360]  with last evening the person that was telling me how the military abandoned trump uh towards the end
[3:30:57.360 --> 3:31:03.840]  nobody really knew what his communication even was with the military as it came up to the 20th
[3:31:03.840 --> 3:31:08.960]  when he was supposed to leave he never conceded but he left why did he leave well what were his
[3:31:08.960 --> 3:31:14.640]  choices he didn't know what his backing from the military what what the military was going to do
[3:31:14.640 --> 3:31:20.080]  and now we see that a major general in the military actually used military resources to
[3:31:20.080 --> 3:31:24.000]  participate in a marxist coup to remove the sitting president of the united states of america
[3:31:24.000 --> 3:31:30.720]  was he supposed to sit there and fight them what were we supposed to do we didn't know anything
[3:31:32.240 --> 3:31:38.000]  it was all a part of a huge mis and disinformation psi op that has been carefully and methodically
[3:31:38.000 --> 3:31:42.400]  planned and orchestrated and then implemented over the course of the last decade and it started
[3:31:42.400 --> 3:31:46.960]  before president donald trump was there he was only a speed bump in the road that they needed
[3:31:46.960 --> 3:31:52.720]  to get out of their way they tried to do it in 2016 it did not work they did and then they
[3:31:52.720 --> 3:31:58.400]  didn't in 2020 and it did they stepped up the algorithms they stole it we know it but we know it
[3:32:00.720 --> 3:32:07.120]  doing something about it is key communication is key the information war is on which is why
[3:32:07.120 --> 3:32:12.160]  you're here every day you're part of the resistance alice jones does a tremendous job i hope that you
[3:32:12.160 --> 3:32:17.440]  follow me over at stu peters dot tv there are a handful of us out here on the front lines
[3:32:17.440 --> 3:32:22.480]  risking it all fighting for it we know that you are too we are all in this together this is a
[3:32:22.480 --> 3:32:29.120]  global citizen thing this is a concerted effort to tear everybody apart limb from limb force them
[3:32:29.120 --> 3:32:35.120]  to their knees and make you and your kids and your grandkids for generations to come subservient to
[3:32:35.120 --> 3:32:44.640]  these criminals switching gears a little bit they're doing this with the bio weapon we know 100
[3:32:44.640 --> 3:32:48.400]  percent for sure that it was man-made we know that it was engineered we know about christina
[3:32:48.400 --> 3:32:53.200]  cassetti by going through fauci's emails we know that he was in communication with her he was asking
[3:32:53.200 --> 3:32:57.600]  her to discredit viable treatments things that would kill the sars-coby-two virus we know why
[3:32:57.600 --> 3:33:03.760]  because he wanted it to succeed these are the people that tried to steal a virus and bill gates
[3:33:03.760 --> 3:33:10.160]  the guy that offered a billion dollars to obtain a virus that had an effective rate that was so
[3:33:10.160 --> 3:33:17.360]  astronomical it would blow up everything 95 percent of males would become sterile and up to 35 percent
[3:33:17.360 --> 3:33:23.920]  of females would become infertile wiping out mankind in just one generation and these two
[3:33:23.920 --> 3:33:29.360]  criminals gates and fauci and whoever is pulling their puppet strings tried to get their hands on
[3:33:29.360 --> 3:33:34.080]  this thing so that they could intentionally release it to the world it was then destroyed
[3:33:34.080 --> 3:33:37.520]  when the person who engineered that virus found out who was trying to get their hands on it and
[3:33:37.520 --> 3:33:43.920]  for what purpose so fauci being undereducated like he is being the narcissist that he is being
[3:33:43.920 --> 3:33:48.640]  the criminal that he is went and manufactured what we are looking at now known as covid 19
[3:33:48.640 --> 3:33:53.440]  he's like a little illegitimate school child running around on the sandbox with a squirt gun
[3:33:53.440 --> 3:33:59.600]  that's ineffective but what was effective was the fear technique that they used in order to
[3:33:59.600 --> 3:34:08.160]  perpetuate these lockdowns we have breaking news from a brief that we had that was leaked an
[3:34:08.160 --> 3:34:12.720]  internal brief that dr. jean ruby is now joining us here to talk about this brief this has to do
[3:34:12.720 --> 3:34:20.320]  with airline pilots dr. jean ruby you have heard that 60 to 80 percent of pilots have been inoculated
[3:34:20.320 --> 3:34:28.720]  at one airline is that true sue thanks for helping get this out i have a document from
[3:34:28.720 --> 3:34:34.880]  united airlines to the american pilots association of america that's based in mclean virginia
[3:34:35.520 --> 3:34:41.120]  in this document they actually it's it's upwards it's 80 it's at least 80 in their words provided
[3:34:41.120 --> 3:34:46.960]  your producers with a copy of this document it's called the brief and it is internal and i actually
[3:34:46.960 --> 3:34:52.640]  was sent to me by several united airline employees i'm not going to specify what their roles are in
[3:34:52.640 --> 3:34:57.920]  the company because i want to keep it as high level as possible and protect them but 80 percent in
[3:34:57.920 --> 3:35:04.240]  this document it says that 80 percent of the of the entire united airlines family is now
[3:35:04.240 --> 3:35:10.240]  injected and what they're doing is they want to before they go to mandates which they are headed
[3:35:10.240 --> 3:35:17.280]  for even for that last 20 percent they are incentivizing or attempting to incentivize
[3:35:17.280 --> 3:35:24.720]  pilots flight attendants and other staff believe it or not with extra hours with a bonus payment
[3:35:24.720 --> 3:35:32.400]  and they they calculate it in hours so 5.15 you know hours for this company and if you get the
[3:35:32.400 --> 3:35:38.320]  jab from you know johnson and johnson you get this amount i mean it's just preposterous on what
[3:35:38.320 --> 3:35:45.360]  scientific basis are they doing anything like that in terms of the bonus and and they're they
[3:35:45.360 --> 3:35:52.640]  say in the document that they want to get as much volunteer you know compliance as possible
[3:35:52.640 --> 3:36:00.320]  before they get to the mandate and so this is really unbelievable at the same time these airlines
[3:36:00.320 --> 3:36:06.560]  are warning publicly the flying public that if they've been injected with these these these
[3:36:06.560 --> 3:36:12.400]  experimental jabs that they should reconsider flying right now uh because of the high risk
[3:36:16.400 --> 3:36:20.320]  i don't know how much time i have left here i'm kind of going blind my my clock is dead if a
[3:36:20.320 --> 3:36:23.760]  producer could tell me in my ear how much time we have left in this segment i don't want to be just
[3:36:23.760 --> 3:36:29.040]  rambling on here without knowing uh so if you can keep me up on the countdown i'd appreciate that
[3:36:29.840 --> 3:36:35.600]  go ahead dr jane i just wanted to say that um at the same time they're they're warning the public
[3:36:35.600 --> 3:36:40.880]  that they could have a higher risk than normal uh for blood clots in flight which as we know
[3:36:40.880 --> 3:36:47.120]  is a normal it for especially for long hauls but with these injections causing my myocarditis
[3:36:47.120 --> 3:36:52.800]  heart attacks strokes they're they're these jabs force you to make the spike protein that then
[3:36:52.800 --> 3:36:59.360]  gets into involved in your blood and does make you clot and throw these clots so flying you could
[3:36:59.360 --> 3:37:04.960]  you could potentially have pilots flying you that that develop a blood clot in their head
[3:37:04.960 --> 3:37:09.360]  and they pass out and you know with the restrictions on the door nobody can get into that door
[3:37:09.360 --> 3:37:13.520]  unless it's unlocked from the inside the cockpit door so this is just absolutely ridiculous
[3:37:13.520 --> 3:37:19.280]  at while they're pushing their their pilots and flight attendants to get jab they are telling
[3:37:19.280 --> 3:37:23.680]  the public that it's dangerous sue it's atrocious and this document proves it
[3:37:23.680 --> 3:37:35.600]  i see you're going to break them so yeah i am i got about 50 seconds here left but i want to keep

[3:39:51.220 --> 3:39:54.220]  Humanity has been domesticated by and large.
[3:39:54.220 --> 3:39:59.220]  The population has been trained to submit to what you're told that's all going to pass.
[3:39:59.220 --> 3:40:03.180]  But if you study authoritarians, if you study the globalists, you understand that they reach
[3:40:03.180 --> 3:40:07.340]  a point where all the training is just beta and you go into the point of being cold, being
[3:40:07.340 --> 3:40:08.340]  totally enslaved.
[3:40:08.340 --> 3:40:12.180]  And because the globalists see us as weak and see us as stupid, they are now making
[3:40:12.180 --> 3:40:13.180]  that move.
[3:40:13.180 --> 3:40:17.180]  And they are collapsing the Third World with their economic weapons to then flood us with
[3:40:17.180 --> 3:40:22.860]  the Third World that the UN will use as a weapon to then have us under such a crisis,
[3:40:22.860 --> 3:40:27.780]  under such a load, capitulate to the UN whatever agreements they want us to sign, hoping that
[3:40:27.780 --> 3:40:33.420]  they will stop the flood of tens of millions of refugees, not fleeing COVID or climate
[3:40:33.420 --> 3:40:38.020]  change as the UN and Klaus Schwabber saying, and Bill Gates is saying, but fleeing the
[3:40:38.020 --> 3:40:44.020]  year-long lockdowns that the UN and Bill Gates ordered them to institute, or they wouldn't
[3:40:44.020 --> 3:40:46.980]  get more IMF and World Bank money.
[3:40:46.980 --> 3:40:50.740]  And that's why we have to really get educated about the globalists.
[3:40:50.740 --> 3:40:55.860]  The Fourth of July SuperSales starts now at informwarstores.com.

[3:41:45.260 --> 3:41:54.260]  The Fourth of July SuperSales starts now at infowarstores.com.
[3:41:54.260 --> 3:42:07.620]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:42:07.620 --> 3:42:12.740]  One of the most horrific things about doing these transmissions, these broadcasts is when
[3:42:12.740 --> 3:42:17.660]  you encounter these technical difficulties, but we are not going to let that stop us from
[3:42:17.660 --> 3:42:18.980]  getting our message out.
[3:42:18.980 --> 3:42:25.900]  Dr. Jane Ruby is joining us, we have internal leaked documents from the airline that suggests
[3:42:25.900 --> 3:42:27.660]  a very horrific reality.
[3:42:27.660 --> 3:42:33.220]  Now, Dr. Jane, we were fact checked on this from our broadcast on the Stu Peters show
[3:42:33.220 --> 3:42:38.180]  by this lead stories or USA Today or whatever saying that, no, fact check, this is false.
[3:42:38.180 --> 3:42:40.220]  This is not a horrific reality.
[3:42:40.220 --> 3:42:48.220]  If unconscious pilots having blood clots and planes occupied by hundreds of people falling
[3:42:48.220 --> 3:42:54.460]  from 35 or 40,000 feet is not a horrific reality, then I don't know what is Dr. Jane Ruby.
[3:42:54.460 --> 3:42:59.540]  We can spend all of our time exposing this stuff and warning people about these inoculations.
[3:42:59.540 --> 3:43:01.460]  We can choose not to be vaccinated.
[3:43:01.460 --> 3:43:07.060]  We can do everything that we can to stay alive, to avoid these bio weapons and to stay out
[3:43:07.060 --> 3:43:12.420]  of the way of this communist regime that is this global cabal that is wanting to force
[3:43:12.420 --> 3:43:14.100]  everybody to their knees.
[3:43:14.100 --> 3:43:18.500]  But if we have to travel, if we have to travel by air, they're going to get us in any way
[3:43:18.500 --> 3:43:20.500]  that they can, aren't they?
[3:43:20.500 --> 3:43:21.500]  Yes.
[3:43:21.500 --> 3:43:32.060]  In fact, if the number in this leaked document, the brief is correct, that 80% of the Delta
[3:43:32.060 --> 3:43:40.780]  pilots and flight attendants are jabbed, this is United Airlines.
[3:43:40.780 --> 3:43:45.180]  I don't know about you, but I can do the math.
[3:43:45.180 --> 3:43:50.540]  That means that four-fifths of their entire flying fleet is running with this extra high
[3:43:50.540 --> 3:43:57.620]  risk for blood clots that can hit the lungs, the brain, the heart, and you'd have a stroke,
[3:43:57.620 --> 3:44:02.420]  a heart attack, or these are fatal situations too.
[3:44:02.420 --> 3:44:09.980]  And since you started talking about this, we've broken this, I'm getting even more sources
[3:44:09.980 --> 3:44:11.820]  that are coming to me.
[3:44:11.820 --> 3:44:15.100]  There are flight attendants and pilots that are petrified.
[3:44:15.100 --> 3:44:16.940]  They're trying to buy their time.
[3:44:16.940 --> 3:44:19.100]  They understand the danger of this.
[3:44:19.100 --> 3:44:21.540]  They do not want to take these injections.
[3:44:21.540 --> 3:44:23.060]  Nothing makes any sense.
[3:44:23.060 --> 3:44:28.340]  And recently, American Airlines, I think everyone has been seeing that they've been shutting
[3:44:28.340 --> 3:44:35.460]  down 25, 30, 40% of their flights, and they're saying that they were pilot shortage.
[3:44:35.460 --> 3:44:38.140]  Airline operations are some of the sharpest people in the world.
[3:44:38.140 --> 3:44:41.180]  They can plan months in advance down to the tee.
[3:44:41.180 --> 3:44:46.020]  What kind of equipment they're going to need, how many airplanes, what kind of staff.
[3:44:46.020 --> 3:44:49.780]  So don't tell me that these pilots aren't there because of a shortage.
[3:44:49.780 --> 3:44:53.460]  They're not there because I think a lot of them are jabbed, a lot of them are ill, they're
[3:44:53.460 --> 3:44:59.540]  not allowed to speak about it, and even worse, who knows what we're about to find out, Stu.
[3:44:59.540 --> 3:45:03.140]  And if you're flying United Airlines, look at the risk that you're at.
[3:45:03.140 --> 3:45:07.460]  I mean, this is a legitimate document that was published on the 4th of June.
[3:45:07.460 --> 3:45:14.420]  A couple of weeks ago, they were now pushing more and more of these pilots towards this
[3:45:14.420 --> 3:45:17.940]  jab by incentivizing them monetarily.
[3:45:17.940 --> 3:45:25.340]  They are hiding behind fact checkers who are propagandists for this installed Biden regime.
[3:45:25.340 --> 3:45:27.700]  They're no different from the mainstream media.
[3:45:27.700 --> 3:45:33.340]  These people are projecting misinformation intentionally knowing that it's going to result
[3:45:33.340 --> 3:45:36.020]  in catastrophic death.
[3:45:36.020 --> 3:45:37.020]  It's absolutely insane.
[3:45:37.020 --> 3:45:42.140]  And as you were saying to me that you had more people that were approaching you when
[3:45:42.140 --> 3:45:46.420]  I was talking and I interrupted you inadvertently due to a little delay here, what I was going
[3:45:46.420 --> 3:45:53.900]  to tell you is that I also too have received dozens of emails from airline employees who
[3:45:53.900 --> 3:45:57.220]  are looking to protect their anonymity because this is their career.
[3:45:57.220 --> 3:46:01.700]  They're trying to, as you said, bide their time and not take this injection, but they
[3:46:01.700 --> 3:46:04.540]  are going to be forced to or they're going to lose their flight hours, they're going
[3:46:04.540 --> 3:46:08.460]  to lose their flight status if they're international, they're not going to be able to fly anymore,
[3:46:08.460 --> 3:46:10.740]  they're going to lose their income, everything they've ever worked for.
[3:46:10.740 --> 3:46:15.220]  Not to mention I have also been approached by somebody who has been involved with the
[3:46:15.220 --> 3:46:20.340]  process of training thousands of pilots from all of these different airlines.
[3:46:20.340 --> 3:46:27.340]  She is telling me that she has received phone calls from a plethora, so many different airline
[3:46:27.340 --> 3:46:30.860]  pilots that have said, I don't want to do this.
[3:46:30.860 --> 3:46:34.660]  We're looking on the screen right now for British airline pilots die after getting the
[3:46:34.660 --> 3:46:35.660]  COVID, COVID jab.
[3:46:35.660 --> 3:46:38.020]  We reported that, we were fact-checked on that.
[3:46:38.020 --> 3:46:43.140]  They didn't take down their tweet over at British Airways, but now they're saying what?
[3:46:43.140 --> 3:46:49.100]  Well, they're coming out and saying that they didn't all die in one week, they didn't die
[3:46:49.100 --> 3:46:52.380]  of the, the jabs, they weren't all jabbed.
[3:46:52.380 --> 3:46:57.540]  Listen, Sue, this is, this is something that we have encountered over and over and over
[3:46:57.540 --> 3:46:58.540]  again.
[3:46:58.540 --> 3:47:06.300]  We get information, we get leaked documents, we get multiple whistleblowers to corroborate
[3:47:06.300 --> 3:47:10.060]  these stories, and then these companies or the media, they're all in lockstep, they're
[3:47:10.060 --> 3:47:14.340]  all zombies as far as I'm concerned, and they all say the same thing.
[3:47:14.340 --> 3:47:15.340]  It's a lie.
[3:47:15.340 --> 3:47:16.340]  It's not happening.
[3:47:16.340 --> 3:47:24.140]  Well, I really dare those fact-characters to go back and look at the British Airways
[3:47:24.140 --> 3:47:25.140]  tweets.
[3:47:25.140 --> 3:47:29.940]  Four pilots in one week don't die, you know, out of the blue as a coincidence.
[3:47:29.940 --> 3:47:31.820]  So this is getting really crazy.
[3:47:31.820 --> 3:47:35.860]  And like I said, since you started breaking this, we started talking about it on your
[3:47:35.860 --> 3:47:36.860]  show.
[3:47:36.860 --> 3:47:41.140]  You know, they're just coming out of the woodwork because they, I had a flight attendant write
[3:47:41.140 --> 3:47:46.940]  to me today and say, you know, thank God that you and Sue Peters are a voice for us.
[3:47:46.940 --> 3:47:50.260]  And I think now that they see that we are talking about it, Sue, and we are making
[3:47:50.260 --> 3:47:55.980]  it a little more public, they are getting courageous to come out and talk to us even
[3:47:55.980 --> 3:47:56.980]  more.
[3:47:56.980 --> 3:48:00.580]  So I really predict in the next few weeks, Sue, we're going to have more and more of
[3:48:00.580 --> 3:48:01.580]  corroboration.
[3:48:01.580 --> 3:48:05.020]  We're going to have more people coming through, and maybe they'll even, even in it with a
[3:48:05.020 --> 3:48:10.180]  dark speed in front of them, you know, come and tell us directly what they're enduring.
[3:48:10.180 --> 3:48:14.900]  We're talking about four British Airways airline pilots.
[3:48:14.900 --> 3:48:18.980]  There were also unconfirmed reports of a dead Delta airline pilot, and I have heard
[3:48:18.980 --> 3:48:21.380]  two now from Delta Airlines.
[3:48:21.380 --> 3:48:26.500]  We had a report of a Canadian cargo jet or a cargo aircraft.
[3:48:26.500 --> 3:48:31.940]  I don't know if it was a jet, but a large cargo plane on the runway in Canada where
[3:48:31.940 --> 3:48:37.580]  the pilot was suddenly rendered unconscious, who had, by the way, had one thing in common
[3:48:37.580 --> 3:48:38.980]  with all of the rest of them.
[3:48:38.980 --> 3:48:42.420]  He had been inoculated recently and he was rendered unconscious.
[3:48:42.420 --> 3:48:45.660]  They had to remove him with a medical crew EMTs.
[3:48:45.660 --> 3:48:48.260]  Thank God that plane didn't get into the air.
[3:48:48.260 --> 3:48:54.740]  We're talking about massive aircraft potentially falling from the sky.
[3:48:54.740 --> 3:49:01.540]  Now aside from the lost souls on board, what about where that thing lands?
[3:49:01.540 --> 3:49:07.060]  I mean, this is intentional domestic terrorism, premeditated murder.
[3:49:07.060 --> 3:49:08.700]  They know what this thing is doing.
[3:49:08.700 --> 3:49:12.580]  Dr. Jane Ruby, we have talked about the VAERS data.
[3:49:12.580 --> 3:49:16.740]  We have talked about the Harvard study that suggests that less than 1% of these things
[3:49:16.740 --> 3:49:17.740]  are being reported.
[3:49:17.740 --> 3:49:25.780]  We've got 60,000 suggesting that 600,000 or more confirmed injuries from these inoculations,
[3:49:25.780 --> 3:49:30.180]  many hundreds of thousands of assumed deaths as a result of this vaccine.
[3:49:30.180 --> 3:49:36.020]  You stopped a study, personally, you did, a trial, when beagle dogs ended up dying, just
[3:49:36.020 --> 3:49:42.700]  a handful of them, not 600,000, not several hundred thousand, but just a couple of dogs.
[3:49:42.700 --> 3:49:46.420]  What are we doing?
[3:49:46.420 --> 3:49:51.380]  Just exactly right to, and I could give you countless examples in my pharmaceutical drug
[3:49:51.380 --> 3:49:56.820]  development experience of 20 years where there are many situations like that where during
[3:49:56.820 --> 3:50:01.780]  the preclinical, or what we, preclinical refers to petri dishes and animals, and during the
[3:50:01.780 --> 3:50:08.260]  preclinical phases, when we're testing them through various breeds of animals, if animals
[3:50:08.260 --> 3:50:11.140]  get sick, even in small numbers, everything is shut down.
[3:50:11.140 --> 3:50:15.580]  The companies are always previously directed to go back and find the reason why.
[3:50:15.580 --> 3:50:24.140]  In the case of the famous antidepressant solexa, which was superseded by its anantium or lexapro,
[3:50:24.140 --> 3:50:31.220]  when solexa was undergoing the animal trials in the 90s, before it, when it was human trials,
[3:50:31.220 --> 3:50:36.220]  I just wanted to, sorry, technical difficulties, Dr. Jane's on the road.
[3:50:36.220 --> 3:50:43.660]  When those six, there were only six beagle dogs, so one breed and six dogs, that study
[3:50:43.660 --> 3:50:47.780]  was shut down for two years, and the company was able to detect that it was a genetic anomaly
[3:50:47.780 --> 3:50:49.820]  specific to that breed.
[3:50:49.820 --> 3:50:50.820]  Can you imagine?
[3:50:50.820 --> 3:50:52.260]  I mean, look at that level of detail.
[3:50:52.260 --> 3:50:55.420]  Now we have children that are starting to die.
[3:50:55.420 --> 3:50:58.300]  We have babies that are bleeding to death.
[3:50:58.300 --> 3:51:01.220]  After breastfeeding, they're inoculated mothers.
[3:51:01.220 --> 3:51:06.700]  Sue, I agree with you, I don't think we have to figure it out.
[3:51:06.700 --> 3:51:08.700]  This is intentional.
[3:51:08.700 --> 3:51:11.260]  Please protect the babies.
[3:51:11.260 --> 3:51:15.620]  We have to figure out how to take this information and now get on the offensive.
[3:51:15.620 --> 3:51:19.140]  Fight back is something that I just, I can't stomach this anymore.
[3:51:19.140 --> 3:51:20.140]  Fight back.
[3:51:20.140 --> 3:51:21.140]  We're on the defense here.
[3:51:21.140 --> 3:51:22.140]  For no reason.
[3:51:22.140 --> 3:51:23.140]  We are the majority.
[3:51:23.140 --> 3:51:24.140]  We have the information.
[3:51:24.140 --> 3:51:25.540]  We have the upper hand.
[3:51:25.540 --> 3:51:26.980]  There are waterfalls of proof.
[3:51:26.980 --> 3:51:28.620]  There are mountains of evidence.
[3:51:28.620 --> 3:51:32.980]  They are right out in front of every single one of these so-called elected representatives.
[3:51:32.980 --> 3:51:40.140]  All of these America first congressional office seat holders, these senators, America first,
[3:51:40.140 --> 3:51:42.620]  this and patriot that, I'm tired of hearing it.
[3:51:42.620 --> 3:51:44.620]  I'm tired of the grandstanding.
[3:51:44.620 --> 3:51:46.620]  Where in the hell are you?
[3:51:46.620 --> 3:51:47.820]  Get out here.
[3:51:47.820 --> 3:51:50.300]  Get out in front and absolutely do something.
[3:51:50.300 --> 3:51:52.940]  You have sworn an oath to office.
[3:51:52.940 --> 3:51:54.940]  It is time for you to uphold it.
[3:51:54.940 --> 3:51:56.340]  The military needs to be involved too.
[3:51:56.340 --> 3:52:01.740]  Look at the purge going on here with the chair of the Joint Chiefs out here saying that this
[3:52:01.740 --> 3:52:04.100]  whole woke thing is great to him.
[3:52:04.100 --> 3:52:05.100]  It's unbelievable.
[3:52:05.100 --> 3:52:06.740]  Dr. Jane Ruby, thank you for joining us on the road.
[3:52:06.740 --> 3:52:10.780]  We know that you're a very busy individual and we appreciate you making the time for us.
[3:52:10.780 --> 3:52:16.620]  The Owen Schreuer war is coming up next right here on Infowars, so make sure that you stick
[3:52:16.620 --> 3:52:17.620]  around for that.
[3:52:17.620 --> 3:52:20.180]  I will hope to be back next Friday after all of these technical difficulties.
[3:52:20.180 --> 3:52:21.540]  I don't know that they're going to have me.
[3:52:21.540 --> 3:52:27.900]  Visit Dr. Jane online anytime at drjaneruby.com and make sure that you come and check me out
[3:52:27.900 --> 3:52:28.900]  at stupeters.tv.
[3:52:28.900 --> 3:52:30.740]  Again, that's stupeters.tv.
[3:52:30.740 --> 3:52:33.060]  Thank you so much for letting me join you here today.
[3:52:33.060 --> 3:52:34.060]  This is the Alex Jones show.
[3:52:34.060 --> 3:52:35.060]  We'll see you next week.
[3:52:35.060 --> 3:52:44.660]  I started taking high-end fish oil and high-end krill oil more than a decade ago because the
[3:52:44.660 --> 3:52:46.820]  scientific literature is overwhelming.
[3:52:46.820 --> 3:53:07.020]  It's good for your heart, your brain, your brain, your brain, your brain, your brain,
[3:53:07.020 --> 3:53:10.180]  your brain.
