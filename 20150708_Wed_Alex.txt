[08:45.920 --> 08:52.760]  turn and the rain it burns like the tears when I said goodbye we're live ladies and
[08:52.760 --> 09:02.160]  gentlemen it's Wednesday already the 8th day of July 2015 you notice we've been having
[09:02.160 --> 09:09.800]  guests on every day about the imminent global financial meltdown that appears to be a foregone
[09:09.800 --> 09:18.840]  conclusion with most of the smart money on serious corrections by this fall or winter
[09:18.840 --> 09:26.440]  and you've heard me come out just last week after two years of not promoting gold and
[09:26.440 --> 09:32.320]  saying that I believe you will see gold by the end of this year dramatically go upwards
[09:32.320 --> 09:37.560]  and I don't normally make specific predictions but I've got to go with my gut on this I've
[09:37.560 --> 09:43.560]  got to go on the activities we've seen of the elites scurrying for cover getting their
[09:43.560 --> 09:51.160]  money out of the west running to armored redouts building secret airfields in remote areas
[09:51.160 --> 09:58.520]  of the Arctic and New Zealand as well as the Ozarks here in the United States I don't
[09:58.520 --> 10:04.920]  like being right about all this I wish I was wrong about forced inoculations and driverless
[10:04.920 --> 10:11.560]  cars and the rise of the robots the Pope has called for world government again today and
[10:11.560 --> 10:21.600]  called it a new world order they have to understand ADL Southern Poverty Law Center MSNBC Democratic
[10:21.600 --> 10:31.680]  Party Republican talk show host have all said you're basically insane or a terrorist if
[10:31.680 --> 10:38.560]  you talk about it that it doesn't exist that's because they were building it in quasi secret
[10:38.560 --> 10:45.480]  the Pope wants a planetary government based on ecological economic order that means socialism
[10:45.480 --> 10:50.000]  communism for the general public elites above the law total surveillance of everything you
[10:50.000 --> 10:57.880]  do to then pay taxes VAT taxes carbon taxes you name it as carbon indulgences to the world
[10:57.880 --> 11:06.720]  government this is the new religion fusing communism collectivism with earth worship
[11:06.720 --> 11:16.560]  run by a church you talk about apostasy you talk about devil you talk about world government
[11:16.560 --> 11:23.440]  you talk about antichrist you talk about what you're beginning to see the beginning of and
[11:23.440 --> 11:30.680]  even if you're an atheist listen to me and listen carefully in a Carl Jung way whether
[11:30.680 --> 11:35.480]  there are spirits and influences and forces in other dimensions which mathematics have
[11:35.480 --> 11:43.640]  proven exist the dimensions regardless humans on a mass scale through group consciousness
[11:43.640 --> 11:49.920]  that's not spiritual it's a fact it's been proven through mass consciousness can manifest
[11:49.920 --> 11:59.360]  these art types of good and evil and we know what's manifesting right now it is 200 proof
[11:59.360 --> 12:09.760]  pure wickedness deception fraud inversion everything the globalists claim they're going
[12:09.760 --> 12:19.800]  to bring us it's the opposite everything they say is a deception epic time right now now
[12:19.800 --> 12:24.760]  what am I getting at Pope calls for world government again and having it based on wealth
[12:24.760 --> 12:31.320]  redistribution and fake environmentalism what is in game made eight years ago break down
[12:31.320 --> 12:37.160]  this exact plan why is it to the word exact because we're following their declassified
[12:37.160 --> 12:43.000]  and leaked statements we have their exact playbook not just the playbook but what plays they're
[12:43.000 --> 12:52.280]  going to play in what order unprecedented to sit here and watch this pure evil rise and
[12:52.280 --> 12:57.360]  they are demonizing anyone that opposes it still saying it doesn't exist while they announce
[12:57.360 --> 13:08.840]  it New York City stock exchange has suspended trading trillions of dollars have been lost
[13:08.840 --> 13:18.800]  in the Chinese stock market today stock markets around the world are rocked told you something
[13:18.800 --> 13:27.000]  Meg was coming and this is just the start my gut tells me in why stock exchange suspends
[13:27.000 --> 13:33.160]  trading the really worrying financial crisis is happening in China not Greece as we've
[13:33.160 --> 13:39.920]  continued to say for the last year in fact we've got to get Mr. Dent on the broadcast
[13:39.920 --> 13:44.720]  because he's the one when almost every other pundit said no China's doing great he's the
[13:44.720 --> 13:49.960]  one saying China is the one that's going to blow its stock market is up 100% in just
[13:49.960 --> 13:55.080]  the last few years it's a total fraud they've got unrest everywhere and when it blows it's
[13:55.080 --> 13:59.680]  going to bring down the whole global economy right as the baby boomers enter the second
[13:59.680 --> 14:10.240]  quadrant of retirement baby boomers from about 1947 through about 1958 depending on what you
[14:10.240 --> 14:15.280]  call a baby boomer they're all retiring the first third is retired we're going into the
[14:15.280 --> 14:24.600]  second third people born in 1950 51 52 53 54 and then the last group retires our population
[14:24.600 --> 14:30.120]  growth is negative we're only bringing in unskilled mainly welfare types now from all
[14:30.120 --> 14:35.440]  over the world I mean we have labor statistics we know we're getting mainly unskilled people
[14:35.440 --> 14:42.360]  here and then now the Democratic Party is there shoving a government milky their way
[14:42.360 --> 14:47.840]  hoping that they then become Democratic Party voters and the Republican Party basically has
[14:47.840 --> 14:54.560]  merged the Democrats so they love it I mean we are burning down right now going totally
[14:54.560 --> 14:59.440]  bankrupt and they're just shipping in as many unskilled people as they can to sink the boat
[14:59.440 --> 15:04.760]  completely like Greece so when we go belly up like Africa has they can come in and just
[15:04.760 --> 15:14.400]  take the whole thing over for nothing Libya was helping all of Africa funding real projects
[15:14.400 --> 15:17.560]  compared to the globalist moon market off he was basically a saint I just have to tell
[15:17.560 --> 15:26.120]  the truth they went in and took him out folks and now all Africa is going into the abyss
[15:26.120 --> 15:30.280]  they blew up all the infrastructure turned Al Qaeda loose to run around murdering everybody
[15:30.280 --> 15:35.360]  now Al Qaeda is spilt all the way into Central Africa all the way into Western Africa and
[15:35.360 --> 15:42.520]  is just running around murdering everyone all run by Hillary Clinton this morning I got
[15:42.520 --> 15:47.760]  about 6am and I was in the shower that's when I tend to wake up made coffee drank half
[15:47.760 --> 15:52.320]  a cup got in the shower turned on a hot shower and I'm just standing there with suds in my
[15:52.320 --> 15:56.200]  hair and I just put my head up against the wall and I was like this can't really be
[15:56.200 --> 15:59.600]  happening that Hillary Clinton is probably going to be our next president when she's
[15:59.600 --> 16:07.720]  such a criminal gangster so evil such a fraud and armed Al Qaeda and ran the whole strategy
[16:07.720 --> 16:11.880]  to destabilize Africa in the Middle East and then I got to hear about how she's a woman
[16:11.880 --> 16:17.480]  and I'm a bigot against women because I don't like her I mean what a triumph over reality
[16:17.480 --> 16:24.080]  political correctness has had after eight years of black versus white under Obama now
[16:24.080 --> 16:30.360]  it's gonna be man versus woman and they're gonna rub salt in the wound while the global
[16:30.360 --> 16:37.560]  economy melts into the ground all we're gonna hear about is how men don't like women dividing
[16:37.560 --> 16:49.120]  and conquering a seven ways to Sunday truly insane the globalists live off chaos their

[35:13.880 --> 35:21.920]  and promoted mindless trendiness mindless fashion mindless cultural Marxism political
[35:21.920 --> 35:28.480]  correctness to a point where about half of the public would jump off a cliff if they
[35:28.480 --> 35:35.400]  were told to do it or they'd be called racist or homophobic or sexist but as many historians
[35:35.400 --> 35:38.840]  have pointed out and his history has showed and as many of our guests have pointed out
[35:38.840 --> 35:44.480]  like Gerald Salente on Monday don't get down and don't feel bad like I do I'm kind of give
[35:44.480 --> 35:51.480]  myself a pep talk but it's true when we run into people that are just so invincibly ignorant

[35:59.480 --> 36:03.840]  about the trial lateral plan we know we're right about where the global government goes
[36:03.840 --> 36:11.080]  we know we're right about the hellish technocracy that they call it a totalitarian technocracy
[36:11.080 --> 36:17.920]  that's their words at Davos where they say we need a totalitarian technocracy the foreign
[36:17.920 --> 36:22.480]  editor of the Financial Times of London wrote an article like six years ago titled and now
[36:22.480 --> 36:29.480]  for world government and you wrote a follow-up article criticizing me and the article says
[36:29.480 --> 36:35.920]  yeah we're secretive yeah we're totalitarian but we know what's best they use those words
[36:35.920 --> 36:41.960]  and then I sit here with mainstream media calling me up all the time I want to do interviews
[36:41.960 --> 36:47.080]  and they go this is the Wall Street Journal or the LA Times or ABC Nightly News or all

[37:46.080 --> 37:53.480]  bad news I mean whoa I always remember growing up here and and then when the Antichrist prepares
[37:53.480 --> 37:57.680]  to rise up they'll put one of their people in the Vatican and the pope will be the false
[37:57.680 --> 38:02.360]  prophet I'm like oh yeah right well hey whether the devil's real or not I'm here to tell you
[38:02.360 --> 38:11.120]  this new pope is the false prophet he fits the bill in every respect I mean I remember

[38:46.080 --> 38:51.680]  media that's all you saw and left us pedo guilds trying to take it over and stuff but
[38:51.680 --> 38:55.040]  as soon as this new pope got in it was like oh my gosh it's like the second coming of
[38:55.040 --> 39:00.760]  Christ he's so sweet he's so loving he helps poor people he feeds children he saves kitty
[39:00.760 --> 39:06.280]  cats out of trees I mean he is like Mother Teresa as a man we just really need to get
[39:06.280 --> 39:10.240]  down on their knees of this guy and he's pushing the exact same agenda of Goldman Sachs and
[39:10.240 --> 39:17.120]  JP Morgan and the EU and the New World Order I mean you talk about a Nathamada freedom
[39:17.120 --> 39:29.040]  this pope is the polar opposite of what's good and he does it slickly and lovingly just
[39:29.040 --> 39:37.680]  like Barack Obama and you notice we got socialists just coming out of the woodwork and communist
[39:37.680 --> 39:42.000]  they're all activating the red brigades are running around in Austin and Dallas and everywhere
[39:42.000 --> 39:47.400]  I go I see folks running around red flags without even trying I caught two different
[39:47.400 --> 39:51.960]  communist marches the last two months on tape just what's all that chanting you're like
[39:51.960 --> 39:57.640]  in a restaurant you look out there's 400 communists running by burning American flags and knocking
[39:57.640 --> 40:06.200]  people over and it's just this is it and again I'm not saying it's a communist conspiracy
[40:06.200 --> 40:12.640]  at its heart the globalist use communist collectives ideologies as their control mechanism with
[40:12.640 --> 40:17.760]  the dumb masses I was reading a it was a CNN article this morning I was like six thirty
[40:17.760 --> 40:23.840]  in the morning I should have printed it but it was like no it was ABC News it was ten super
[40:23.840 --> 40:28.440]  fans of Bernie Sanders and it was like I'm a socialist I want a socialist utopia and
[40:28.440 --> 40:33.200]  I don't want to pay off my student loans and I want other people to pay for it I mean it
[40:33.200 --> 40:39.840]  read like a nightmare of theft but I had to realize no no this is for the average American
[40:39.840 --> 40:46.560]  to read that and go yeah I want free stuff oh you'll get free stuff like Cuba and Venezuela
[40:46.560 --> 40:52.480]  that have collapsed repeatedly I always hear people go man we're gonna have great free
[40:52.480 --> 40:59.360]  healthcare like Canada every Canadian I know comes down here for healthcare it's horrible
[40:59.360 --> 41:04.640]  we need a national health service like England it's wonderful CNN told me so oh really is
[41:04.640 --> 41:10.440]  that why Paul Watson when he had strep threat a few years ago couldn't for a month get any
[41:10.440 --> 41:17.080]  antibiotics they just kept giving him a little pack of like gloves and aspirin you just go
[41:17.080 --> 41:24.000]  home and then die he couldn't get permission from them to go see a private doctor you have
[41:24.000 --> 41:29.000]  to get permission from the government to go see a private doctor and if you're not on
[41:29.000 --> 41:35.600]  the end crowd the ring knocking crowd you don't get to get in thank God he just got
[41:35.600 --> 41:40.840]  better with herbal stuff but he was like out for like three weeks coughing up blood kept
[41:40.840 --> 41:50.200]  going begging for help had money just knew we're sorry and then the average moron because
[41:50.200 --> 41:54.920]  they've got a Obama sticker on their car thinks the healthcare is going to be great as we
[41:54.920 --> 42:02.880]  watch healthcare prices explode and the economy collapse which is the plan so I'm not trying
[42:02.880 --> 42:09.360]  to be nasty and negative here I've just had enough I mean by the way Niko I meant to ask
[42:09.360 --> 42:18.800]  you in the break how's it going with Harry Dent good good because because he's the guy
[42:18.800 --> 42:24.080]  that has just been as of late he's been predicting stuff for more than 20 years accurately in
[42:24.080 --> 42:30.400]  the best selling author but I mean he's been dead on about so much and I want to get his
[42:30.400 --> 42:36.200]  take on the China situation because he's been saying that he believes it's imminent by the
[42:36.200 --> 42:41.160]  end of the year that China would go belly up and you tune into other pundits and people
[42:41.160 --> 42:45.760]  and it's all just China's wonderful China's great if you don't like it you're racist I've
[42:45.760 --> 42:50.480]  actually been hearing that and again if you don't like gangrene you're racist and if you
[42:50.480 --> 42:55.600]  don't like Jade Helm troops on the street you're racist they had hardball attack us
[42:55.600 --> 43:02.440]  last night about our deep racism we just don't trust the black president I didn't trust Bush
[43:02.440 --> 43:07.560]  getting rid of the Posse Comintatus this is all part of a bipartisan takeover but Obama
[43:07.560 --> 43:14.320]  is their front man and they do use the fact that he's part African to to have a shield
[43:14.320 --> 43:22.720]  so they make it racial and then we have no other choice but to point it out and we're
[43:22.720 --> 43:31.840]  so paralyzed because of it it's like race and sex issues have become the Kiari darts
[43:31.840 --> 43:37.320]  Brazilian natives you know will shoot monkeys for dinner and birds for dinner with little
[43:37.320 --> 43:44.560]  blowgun darts that are dipped in Kiari and it paralyzes them and they just throw them
[43:44.560 --> 43:48.800]  in their bags are still alive they get home and roast them don't need refrigeration when
[43:48.800 --> 43:54.640]  you've got paralyzation paralytics I guess you call them and that's what political correctness
[43:54.640 --> 44:00.520]  is just disease crime pouring over Latin America collapsing 7 million people worldwide the
[44:00.520 --> 44:06.360]  west collapsing a globalist destabilizing any country that tries to get on its feet to
[44:06.360 --> 44:12.800]  bring down the third world then flooding everybody with it and you pointed out and racist and
[44:12.800 --> 44:18.680]  then everybody just says okay open the border you're already dark when I had my hernia surgery
[44:18.680 --> 44:22.960]  they said yeah we don't really use a lot of chemicals anymore it turned out the anesthesiologist
[44:22.960 --> 44:29.680]  was a listener who had actually known back in college and when he was a graduate student
[44:29.680 --> 44:32.400]  and then we had a nice 20 minute talk for him knocked me out and he says don't worry
[44:32.400 --> 44:35.760]  he goes I know you said the last time he got knocked out for surgery it took nine times
[44:35.760 --> 44:39.920]  that was when you were 16 you also call that the teenager effect sometimes teenagers takes
[44:39.920 --> 44:44.960]  a lot to put them under he said I think you'll take the normal dose for a 235 pound guy took
[44:44.960 --> 44:51.080]  them double the kiari and maybe that's what it is maybe maybe politically too there's
[44:51.080 --> 44:56.200]  a point where all finally go under and just submit and go I'm sorry I kneel to the pope
[44:56.200 --> 45:00.280]  and world government and the new corporate government and the new Christ leader that
[45:00.280 --> 45:05.840]  will rise that will be endorsed as our Gaia leader and then I'll just say chop the right
[45:05.840 --> 45:12.000]  wingers heads off and I'll wear a pink tutu and just hop around like liberal liberal I
[45:12.000 --> 45:19.640]  mean you know I I I mean maybe at some point maybe now I'll just kneel kneel to the pope
[45:19.640 --> 45:26.560]  and just yes world government communism is the answer Che Guevara you are right oh yes
[45:26.560 --> 45:35.960]  I I I mean it's twilight zone and have you noticed how sickeningly accurate this radio
[45:35.960 --> 45:42.040]  show is and how everything we talk about just keeps happening I don't like that as I've
[45:42.040 --> 45:49.520]  said a thousand times or more it's like a slow motion car wreck or like watching one
[45:49.520 --> 45:56.560]  of my children being being being skinned alive or something in slow motion I mean I don't
[45:56.560 --> 46:01.000]  hate the idiots that are under a mind control trance I don't hate the people that were inducted
[46:01.000 --> 46:08.800]  into all this stuff but they're still dangerous as a horde of the idiots in fact we do have
[46:08.800 --> 46:15.240]  a clip now of Pope Francis at the Vatican this morning when he called for world government
[46:15.240 --> 46:22.720]  and we're going to play that clip right now in order to ensure the security and continuing
[46:22.720 --> 46:48.840]  stability the republic will be reorganized into the first empire for safety and security
[46:48.840 --> 46:55.320]  so this is how freedom dies to thunderous applause and you know I'm laughing about all this because
[46:55.320 --> 46:59.680]  I'm not going to get depressed and and some people say Alex people are waking up some
[46:59.680 --> 47:09.200]  good things are happening I get it but in my gut
[47:09.200 --> 47:15.600]  so he's calling for a new world order an ecological economic order meaning socialism and fascist
[47:15.600 --> 47:19.960]  tyranny for the green police and again a few weeks ago called specifically for a planetary
[47:19.960 --> 47:29.520]  government to carry this out for everyone's security and prosperity of course remember
[47:29.520 --> 47:36.520]  this article from June 23rd we broke a secret tech stock program with Google cars in Austin
[47:36.520 --> 47:48.680]  and all over the state busily running into people well here it is out of AP today Google
[47:48.680 --> 47:55.160]  test driverless cars in Austin but don't worry with safety drivers again I'm just saying
[47:55.160 --> 48:04.240]  we we broke that see we broke that two weeks ago not bragging just continuing that we're
[48:04.240 --> 48:07.680]  not the conspiracy theorist when they call someone a conspiracy theorist that means a
[48:07.680 --> 48:13.600]  thinking person who's not in a trance who gets in the way of the known liars and then
[48:13.600 --> 48:16.280]  yeah there are a lot of lay folks out there that are just not waking up that come up with
[48:16.280 --> 48:29.400]  wild theories because I mean if the mainstream media is lying if the mainstream media is
[48:29.400 --> 48:34.160]  lying and then you've got to go find out what the truth is they're gonna have a lot of speculation
[48:34.160 --> 48:38.400]  and they can go out and show our different speculation about what's happening to then
[48:38.400 --> 48:44.560]  try to discredit us like we're a whole cacophony or tower of Babel not knowing what we're talking
[48:44.560 --> 48:49.880]  about well that's the general public trying to suck stuff out I know what's going on because
[48:49.880 --> 48:54.480]  I've read Carol Quigley's books I've read Zabigny Brzezinski's books I've read David
[48:54.480 --> 48:59.240]  Rockefeller's books I've read their op-ed pieces I've read foreign affairs I've read
[48:59.240 --> 49:05.920]  declassified congressional Frank church reports I have read the memoirs of these people Helmut
[49:05.920 --> 49:10.440]  Schmidt and the rest of them I've infiltrated Bohemian Grove I've interviewed former MI six
[49:10.440 --> 49:15.440]  officers like John Coleman Dr. John Coleman I've interviewed the special forces commanders
[49:15.440 --> 49:19.800]  I've interviewed the former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Admiral Mora repeatedly
[49:19.800 --> 49:27.640]  I've interviewed them on and off air I know what's going on they know what's going on
[49:27.640 --> 49:34.680]  and so they just denied denied denied with the brainwash public not what understanding
[49:34.680 --> 49:40.440]  what's going on and then now China's stock market has plunged 30% trillions and trillions
[49:40.440 --> 49:54.400]  have been lost in the financial times of London and others are asking is this the new 1929
[49:54.400 --> 49:59.600]  well I'm sure if we give unlimited trillions to select banks to prop it up which is now
[49:59.600 --> 50:07.320]  happening in China while all western eyes remain firmly focused on Greece a potentially
[50:07.320 --> 50:10.880]  much more significant financial crisis is developing on the other side of the world
[50:10.880 --> 50:16.920]  in some quarters it's already being called China's 1929 the year of the most infamous
[50:16.920 --> 50:20.440]  stock market crash in history and the start of the economic catastrophe of the Great
[50:20.440 --> 50:27.480]  Depression which of course led to a giant war in any normal summer a 30% fall the Chinese
[50:27.480 --> 50:32.040]  stock market a loss of value roughly equivalent to the UK's entire economic output last year
[50:32.040 --> 50:37.480]  after an unassent which has seen share prices more than double in the span of a year would
[50:37.480 --> 50:41.760]  have been front page news across the globe then it goes into how it isn't the drastic
[50:41.760 --> 50:46.120]  series of government interventions to stem the panic and of course it's that government
[50:46.120 --> 50:51.640]  intervention to certain funds that is the real robbery going on and then now they halted
[50:51.640 --> 50:57.760]  trading on the NAS on the New York Stock Exchange and they say it was a glitch more lies more

[01:00:18.480 --> 01:00:29.800]  from austin texas alex jones you know a lot of people will say hey alex aren't you happy
[01:00:29.800 --> 01:00:34.400]  things are going exactly as you said they would and that prove you're right no it's
[01:00:34.400 --> 01:00:41.180]  like telling your friend you better stop drinking i had a friend this happened to an entire handle
[01:00:41.180 --> 01:00:46.680]  of vodka every day or it's going to kill you and he had liver failure and a bunch of
[01:00:46.680 --> 01:00:57.120]  the stuff and died and i currently know someone else this is happening too was drinking a
[01:00:57.120 --> 01:01:02.400]  bottle of scotch every day and then when they collapse and die i don't go wow i was right
[01:01:02.400 --> 01:01:07.240]  this is great i'm i'm angry because out of this new crisis they're going to get even
[01:01:07.240 --> 01:01:13.040]  more power more bailouts the very criminals that have orchestrated all this will only
[01:01:13.040 --> 01:01:18.680]  get more power and again my brain has been burning trying to analyze this obviously
[01:01:18.680 --> 01:01:23.880]  right as the chinese stock market went into a nosedive now forty percent drop in their
[01:01:23.880 --> 01:01:33.480]  main index that's from time just breaking the shins in composite index drop forty percent
[01:01:33.480 --> 01:01:46.640]  right as that began the new york stock exchange had its internal glitch and then just magically
[01:01:46.640 --> 01:01:52.200]  that's when all this happened that's because they simply went in turned the stock market
[01:01:52.200 --> 01:01:57.120]  off so there couldn't be a plunge here to then basically manipulate the stocks and try
[01:01:57.120 --> 01:02:03.400]  to go into the chinese stocks and bail them out and they still haven't turned the nasdaq
[01:02:03.400 --> 01:02:10.640]  completely back on because they know it will start sending our stock market down but see
[01:02:10.640 --> 01:02:15.560]  in the past when they closed trading they would admit that they did it like on nine eleven
[01:02:15.560 --> 01:02:20.400]  to stop a total collapse now they just lie and say it's a computer glitch the policy
[01:02:20.400 --> 01:02:29.320]  is a wall of lies i mean we know they turned it off and close the market to stop a crash
[01:02:29.320 --> 01:02:34.080]  or to control it and they just lie to us and go no and i guarantee you there'll be articles
[01:02:34.080 --> 01:02:40.560]  conspiracy theorist alex jones uh thinks uh maybe they uh turned it off to uh stop a
[01:02:40.560 --> 01:02:44.920]  crash want to cook it was just a weird glitch that would be one of the biggest stories of
[01:02:44.920 --> 01:02:50.360]  the year normally and cause huge investigations but it'll just be papered over no big deal
[01:02:50.360 --> 01:02:57.880]  don't have critical thinking and i'm not up here on some high horse going gee i'm so smart
[01:02:57.880 --> 01:03:05.520]  this is obvious a lobotomized rat would know this information kit daniels has a report
[01:03:05.520 --> 01:03:12.360]  on it chinese stocks collapsed right before nasdaq shut down nasdaq still opened new york
[01:03:12.360 --> 01:03:18.240]  stock exchange shut down before new york stock exchange shut down hang sing index plunged
[01:03:18.240 --> 01:03:27.720]  its most since 2008 financial crisis but they say there's no connection to that and there's
[01:03:27.720 --> 01:03:33.360]  no connection to birds flying in the sky no connection to large aircraft flying at airports
[01:03:33.360 --> 01:03:40.840]  no connection to uh beer and football no connection to bill clinton lying no connection to hillary
[01:03:40.840 --> 01:03:46.960]  being a terrorist and funding al-qaeda no the truth is it's completely naked and only
[01:03:46.960 --> 01:03:54.640]  a moron i mean we do an article or report just saying does anybody believe this is actually
[01:03:54.640 --> 01:03:58.800]  a glitch it's obvious they turned the stock market off and suspended trading which is
[01:03:58.800 --> 01:04:02.960]  what you do during a plunge but instead of being honest about it they'll tell all the
[01:04:02.960 --> 01:04:09.320]  sheeple that they just had a glitch which destroys even more confidence because here's the deal
[01:04:09.320 --> 01:04:16.080]  they're jumping the shark on this one even the dumbest dumbbell knows they turned the
[01:04:16.080 --> 01:04:21.600]  stock market off just to to to slow down the collapse they want to have a controlled collapse
[01:04:21.600 --> 01:04:29.720]  grandstand get more global currency wars going consolidate power before they do this
[01:04:29.720 --> 01:04:36.480]  but this is certainly setting the stage going into the winter as i've told everybody for

[01:08:07.080 --> 01:08:17.040]  all right we've been on air an hour and eight minutes ladies and gentlemen we have seen
[01:08:17.040 --> 01:08:24.120]  a 40 drop across the board in the major index in the chinese stock market the chinese economy
[01:08:24.120 --> 01:08:28.920]  really is the biggest economy in the world they are the second largest owner of our debt
[01:08:28.920 --> 01:08:37.880]  behind the private european owned hedge fund run federal reserve right as the chinese stock
[01:08:37.880 --> 01:08:43.640]  market went into nosedive this morning the new york stock exchange had a quote glitch
[01:08:43.640 --> 01:08:51.360]  not cyber related cyber crime related were told by the securities and exchange commission
[01:08:51.360 --> 01:08:58.280]  and it was shut down we also had united airlines flights grounded all morning with a total computer
[01:08:58.280 --> 01:09:04.360]  shut down now a couple things can be happening here the chinese stock market has been overvalued
[01:09:04.360 --> 01:09:09.440]  up a hundred percent in the last year the government openly pumps money into it it's
[01:09:09.440 --> 01:09:17.120]  as phony as ours so it's time for it to go down the global economy is in deep trouble
[01:09:17.120 --> 01:09:23.120]  the globalist the big insiders ride these things up and down the gree situation the
[01:09:23.120 --> 01:09:30.760]  e you in trouble all of this it could be a coincidence but my gut tells me that this
[01:09:30.760 --> 01:09:36.760]  is a cyber war between the u.s. and china i'm not saying that i'm saying there's too
[01:09:36.760 --> 01:09:42.080]  many coincidences and too many other weird because i was looking earlier other computer
[01:09:42.080 --> 01:09:47.000]  systems and other companies are having total computer failures as well and china's having
[01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:52.640]  computer failures so china has its stock market plunging even though they're trying to prop
[01:09:52.640 --> 01:09:58.320]  it up i mean a huge whopping 40 percent the new york stock exchange shuts down right as
[01:09:58.320 --> 01:10:05.120]  this begins was that them shutting it down to protect the market and lying to the public
[01:10:05.120 --> 01:10:10.000]  i mean used to that you've they've had market holidays before 9 11 and other events they
[01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:14.600]  could have just been honest about it said we're shutting it down to stop the contagion
[01:10:14.600 --> 01:10:19.960]  but as an instinct now they lie when the truth will serve them better so did they show i'm
[01:10:19.960 --> 01:10:23.840]  going to ask reg palis right now he didn't like to speculate but i'm going to ask you
[01:10:23.840 --> 01:10:29.320]  is it a cyber war is it a false flag to get cyber homeland security takeover passed is
[01:10:29.320 --> 01:10:33.400]  it shutting down the stock market so that it doesn't get driven down which is a normal
[01:10:33.400 --> 01:10:39.800]  procedure and they're just lying to us or is it really just a glitch and all this is
[01:10:39.800 --> 01:10:46.080]  happening greg palis bestselling author bbc and abc news host an investigative journalist
[01:10:46.080 --> 01:10:50.600]  had a arrest warrant issued by homeland security eight years ago because he was showing toxic
[01:10:50.600 --> 01:10:56.040]  waste dumping in leasing anna it was under the patriot act showing that is a is a infrastructure
[01:10:56.040 --> 01:11:01.400]  protection act violation uh traveled to greece many times during the last collapse we we
[01:11:01.400 --> 01:11:06.400]  got him set up today to talk about greece the e you what's happening on that front but
[01:11:06.400 --> 01:11:11.040]  now clearly we're not being told the truth about the biggest shakeup in the markets we've
[01:11:11.040 --> 01:11:17.280]  seen since 2008 greg palis you were formerly the top on the top federal crime investigators
[01:11:17.280 --> 01:11:21.320]  during the savings and loan and other events so you're an expert on this you'll live in
[01:11:21.320 --> 01:11:27.240]  new york city what does your gut tell you is really going on right now greg palis of
[01:11:27.240 --> 01:11:33.480]  greg palis dot com well as you know is you said it right i don't speculate and i don't
[01:11:33.480 --> 01:11:38.280]  guess uh so all i can do but now i'm gonna have to just uh all i can do is tell you
[01:11:38.280 --> 01:11:42.760]  what i believe in what i think is probably going on but again i would really have to
[01:11:42.760 --> 01:11:47.920]  investigate it it has all the the remarks of of a quick shutdown to stop an instant
[01:11:47.920 --> 01:11:53.120]  the collapse keep in mind that a tremendous amount probably the majority of trades on
[01:11:53.120 --> 01:11:59.160]  the new york stock exchange are done automatically by computers so if they sniff a beginning of
[01:11:59.160 --> 01:12:07.000]  a fall in stocks broad fall they the the computers themselves start massively going into sell
[01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:10.960]  then you have what and their program to shut down for what i've been told now yes they
[01:12:10.960 --> 01:12:16.080]  have there's a so what happens when there's a certain imbalance between buy orders and
[01:12:16.080 --> 01:12:20.600]  sell orders for example there's a massive number of sell orders against for western
[01:12:20.600 --> 01:12:25.960]  companies with big china holdings which we're seeing right now and also at the same time
[01:12:25.960 --> 01:12:31.720]  the greek banks have been closed and uh there's shaky uh in the european community you can
[01:12:31.720 --> 01:12:37.000]  imagine that the robot traders at that the machines are of course all their sensing is
[01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:43.160]  down down down sell sell sell so i think that the the stock exchange said uh pour some water
[01:12:43.160 --> 01:12:47.600]  on your computers tell them to go relax and have a nap and come back later when things
[01:12:47.600 --> 01:12:51.920]  have settled i think it's pretty clear what's happened and you announce of course that you're
[01:12:51.920 --> 01:12:56.160]  shutting down to stop a panic you've just you're now going to create a panic so you
[01:12:56.160 --> 01:12:59.440]  don't say we're stopping i agree with you greg that's probably what happened i give
[01:12:59.440 --> 01:13:05.200]  it about a 98 chance but but correct me if wrong they've they've had stock market holidays
[01:13:05.200 --> 01:13:09.520]  before and admitted it and in a way that restores confidence because they're being honest i mean
[01:13:09.520 --> 01:13:14.080]  everybody knows this is a shutdown on purpose so lying about it i think only hurts confidence
[01:13:14.080 --> 01:13:18.440]  more here's my question in the past they were more honest about this weren't they why are
[01:13:18.440 --> 01:13:23.120]  they lying about it now well let's let's assume that they are lying about that is they're
[01:13:23.120 --> 01:13:27.400]  not giving us the full story i think it's it's about telling these automated uh the
[01:13:27.400 --> 01:13:34.080]  companies that are robot um selling that the that the robo systems have to take a a breather
[01:13:34.080 --> 01:13:42.080]  for a minute before they create an unstoppable momentum uh i mean look um as as the fbi once
[01:13:42.080 --> 01:13:48.360]  told me when i was investigating uh uh the the uh the business with al-qaeda uh there's
[01:13:48.360 --> 01:13:53.600]  some things that the public ought not to know that's a quote from the uh from the the official
[01:13:53.600 --> 01:13:58.320]  quote from the fbi when i was investigating for bbc so obviously they decided that this
[01:13:58.320 --> 01:14:04.120]  is one more case of something the public quote ought not to know so uh you should maybe you
[01:14:04.120 --> 01:14:08.960]  should be grateful that they you know stopped your 401k from going lower than your shoelaces
[01:14:08.960 --> 01:14:15.280]  alex sure but it shows how rigged the markets are the chinese don't even deny that their
[01:14:15.280 --> 01:14:21.280]  markets completely uh fabricated but it seems like this balancing act this house of cards
[01:14:21.280 --> 01:14:28.520]  is going into an end game a strong wind is coming a storm is coming uh what is your prognosis
[01:14:28.520 --> 01:14:33.560]  on the global economy and the real players involved in it well i think the one percent
[01:14:33.560 --> 01:14:38.440]  is doing okay they're going to protect themselves and as you know i've just been writing about
[01:14:38.440 --> 01:14:42.720]  greece in fact i was writing uh doing something that very few people have done i'm working
[01:14:42.720 --> 01:14:48.600]  with a greek uh journalists and experts from athens so that the article i that that's
[01:14:48.600 --> 01:14:54.480]  at gregpalas.com is actually written uh you know not only by myself where i've been working
[01:14:54.480 --> 01:14:58.840]  with greece for a long time but uh with my colleagues on the ground in athens the one
[01:14:58.840 --> 01:15:03.720]  percent are going to take care of themselves you see this tremendous attack on greece so
[01:15:03.720 --> 01:15:08.840]  what's going on here with the euro when they're calling for massive so-called privatizations
[01:15:08.840 --> 01:15:13.000]  well it's the elite taking all the all the properties private the public beaches the
[01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:17.000]  parks the waterworks the shipping yeah let's be clear it's not like they go out and buy
[01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:21.680]  some private land and then compete next to a city beach they get it for pennies on the
[01:15:21.680 --> 01:15:26.800]  dollar on derivatives they sold the country explain how this scam works yeah basically
[01:15:26.800 --> 01:15:33.200]  you have the arsonists the guys who started the fire buy up the stuff at the fire sale
[01:15:33.200 --> 01:15:38.920]  now this started okay i in my book fault just picnic i went through the long investigation
[01:15:38.920 --> 01:15:46.720]  on this what happened was is back in uh in uh the about two thousand four five six golden
[01:15:46.720 --> 01:15:52.400]  sacks and jp morgan for both spain and greece and a couple of other nations were playing
[01:15:52.400 --> 01:15:58.520]  games where they were hiding the deficits of these nations by phony currency trades involving
[01:15:58.520 --> 01:16:03.680]  billions and tens of billions of dollars it was just absolutely stunning in and so the
[01:16:03.680 --> 01:16:07.680]  entire nation of greece was claiming it had only three percent deficit when i had about
[01:16:07.680 --> 01:16:13.320]  a six or seven percent deficit uh the people that bought their bonds on good faith when
[01:16:13.320 --> 01:16:17.840]  when this whole scam blew open when a new government came in said oops gee this these
[01:16:17.840 --> 01:16:23.680]  books are just completely dishonest uh as if they didn't know uh well golden sacks ended
[01:16:23.680 --> 01:16:29.120]  up uh uh ended up taking a half billion dollar fee for running this scam i understand i was
[01:16:29.120 --> 01:16:33.400]  an investigator with with the federal government we used to put people in jail for this stuff
[01:16:33.400 --> 01:16:37.920]  but i guess if you know it was a half a million you go to the prison but you know if you get
[01:16:37.920 --> 01:16:44.880]  a half billion fee you know you just get a bonus uh so the scam blew open that that force
[01:16:44.880 --> 01:16:50.920]  greece to now because no one trusted them to uh have to pay you serious fees fourteen
[01:16:50.920 --> 01:16:55.840]  fifteen sixteen percent to pay off their uh their debts and it's just like anyone else
[01:16:55.840 --> 01:16:59.160]  it's not that greeks are you know this whole idea that greeks are a bunch of lazy people
[01:16:59.160 --> 01:17:04.680]  that they that they're just oozo drinking olive pits spitting lazy guys who retire when
[01:17:04.680 --> 01:17:10.000]  they're thirty six is nonsense pure bold yeah it's pure bold and just by the way the information
[01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:15.400]  look it up at the oecd which is the site of the uh of the organization of economically
[01:17:15.400 --> 01:17:21.680]  developed nations um greeks work more greeks who have jobs there's twenty five percent
[01:17:21.680 --> 01:17:28.240]  unemployment greeks who have jobs work six hundred hours a year more than germans who
[01:17:28.240 --> 01:17:32.280]  are the so greeks work more than anyone in the uh well my parents one of their favorite
[01:17:32.280 --> 01:17:37.240]  places to go is is greece i've been to europe never to greece yet and and and they say they've
[01:17:37.240 --> 01:17:42.080]  been there and they say the greeks are like working at ten o'clock at night with uh with
[01:17:42.080 --> 01:17:46.760]  their gardens and growing their own food and truck farms and running a restaurant while
[01:17:46.760 --> 01:17:51.400]  they go out and catch the fish and i mean the it's just not true the greeks are sitting
[01:17:51.400 --> 01:17:56.200]  around their butts yeah and then the germans actually work the fewest hours of any nation
[01:17:56.200 --> 01:18:00.800]  in the uh in the uh developed world and then and then they put out the meme i'm not bashing
[01:18:00.800 --> 01:18:05.520]  germans but the government does that the greeks are lazy yeah this whole idea that greeks are
[01:18:05.520 --> 01:18:10.880]  lazy because it goes back to the kind of arian nation business it's it's basically there's
[01:18:10.880 --> 01:18:15.640]  a racial element in this which is which you can smell a mile away well and that's actually
[01:18:15.640 --> 01:18:21.320]  true let's not forget germany did invade greece in 41 with pair troopers yeah and and by the
[01:18:21.320 --> 01:18:25.680]  way they borrowed they the germans borrowed money with they owe greece 11 billion dollars
[01:18:25.680 --> 01:18:30.080]  they've never paid it back by the way and uh now they're saying that the greeks owe them
[01:18:30.080 --> 01:18:34.320]  the problem of the euro the problem of the euro is that it's it's not a currency it's
[01:18:34.320 --> 01:18:39.520]  a disease and what's happened is that the greeks even the greek current government which it's
[01:18:39.520 --> 01:18:45.920]  really exciting to see the greeks stand up and say no uh and by the way we keep talking
[01:18:45.920 --> 01:18:50.960]  about the greek crisis well there's 25 unemployment in greece but there's almost that much unemployment
[01:18:50.960 --> 01:18:57.440]  in spain and yet we don't talk about the spanish crisis it's not a crisis it's resistance the
[01:18:57.440 --> 01:19:02.320]  spaniards have basically given up they've just decided look we can't win we can't beat the
[01:19:02.320 --> 01:19:10.000]  big powers and so the poor spaniards are uh you know one in four is out of work the others
[01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:15.360]  are under uh underemployed it's it's a massive disaster in spain but we don't call it a crisis
[01:19:15.360 --> 01:19:20.480]  because basically they've agreed to the occupation by financial powers running the euro greece the
[01:19:20.480 --> 01:19:25.760]  people have said no on the other hand they're they're told if they get rid of the euro that the
[01:19:25.760 --> 01:19:29.360]  sky will fall well it's like leper's saying we don't want leprosy but we don't want to leave
[01:19:29.360 --> 01:19:34.480]  the leper colony well wouldn't greece just do good now with the devalued currency because
[01:19:34.480 --> 01:19:39.280]  they're based on tourism uh and to leave the euro and just default especially when they can never

[01:24:15.360 --> 01:24:20.240]  leon macadoo did where she went out and interviewed austinites and most of them thought grease deserved
[01:24:20.240 --> 01:24:29.120]  it was happening to them with with no education about it and to see people sitting on top of
[01:24:29.120 --> 01:24:37.200]  debt per capita bigger than greases saying hey it's their debt they should pay it shows the triumph
[01:24:37.200 --> 01:24:44.000]  of disinformation greg palest what's the next big shoot a drop the investigative journalist joining
[01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:52.400]  us and what are the latest big mega banking scams that you're tracking i can't i can't give you too
[01:24:52.400 --> 01:24:58.320]  any hits about the scams i'm tracking at this moment of course uh but i will say that i'm looking
[01:24:58.320 --> 01:25:04.000]  into uh some of the billionaires who are uh we're taking down the the u.s and of course they're
[01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:09.760]  behind all the candidates both democratic and republican sides you have to be not uh not every
[01:25:09.760 --> 01:25:15.840]  candidate but um the leading candidates uh one of the big concerns i have is that the guys who
[01:25:15.840 --> 01:25:22.800]  crashed wall streets are um are taking are suddenly these hedge fund managers are hedging their bets
[01:25:22.800 --> 01:25:28.800]  by buying up candidates in a way that we haven't seen in prior elections like this guy paul the
[01:25:28.800 --> 01:25:35.680]  vulture singer who is a multi-billionaire who uh basically one of the people who took down grease
[01:25:35.680 --> 01:25:41.840]  um and you know remember when i say they took down grease these are guys who bankrupted the nation
[01:25:41.840 --> 01:25:49.040]  and then demanded all their uh uh demanded their um their properties and when you know we talk about
[01:25:49.040 --> 01:25:55.920]  bailouts of grease i want to make this clear the european central bank in its 150 billion
[01:25:55.920 --> 01:26:01.920]  dollars that it's supposedly given grease grease got zero i'm wondering this is very very important
[01:26:01.920 --> 01:26:08.400]  for people to understand grease got zero the money went to deutsche bank goldman sacks jp morgan
[01:26:08.400 --> 01:26:14.640]  uh cred credit leonese and other big banks which held greek bonds basically the european people
[01:26:15.520 --> 01:26:22.880]  paid off the debts of the greek debts held by these big banks which were charging monster fees
[01:26:22.880 --> 01:26:27.360]  and now they're saying okay they're telling greek people now you have to bail out our bailout
[01:26:27.360 --> 01:26:34.640]  and and it's coming down to a massive per family uh interest charges of of 10 to 15
[01:26:34.640 --> 01:26:40.000]  thousand dollars a year and under greek salaries it's impossible it's impossible it's a mortgage
[01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:46.720]  that can't be paid and greg notice the latest deal was a huge new added vat on their only cash
[01:26:46.720 --> 01:26:51.200]  crop that's tourism and the greeks were like wait a minute you want to destroy us but the
[01:26:51.200 --> 01:26:57.840]  documents you got back in 2002 showed that this is what these groups want is the collapse so what
[01:26:57.840 --> 01:27:05.120]  will the globalist ultimately do to spain and ireland and france i mean what are the next
[01:27:05.120 --> 01:27:10.000]  countries that they're going to suck drive because just because spain and others have run up the white
[01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:15.360]  flag that never keeps the vampires from draining you no that's just the beginning they're they're
[01:27:15.360 --> 01:27:19.680]  basically going to be taking all these assets in the case of grease by the way one of the big assets
[01:27:19.680 --> 01:27:25.840]  that they were trying to grab is grease has tremendous offshore gas resources and at the
[01:27:25.840 --> 01:27:33.120]  moment obviously the natural gas market has has collapsed but believe me they're going to be going
[01:27:33.120 --> 01:27:38.960]  after those resources i you know we see in ireland ireland actually has gold um they're they're
[01:27:38.960 --> 01:27:44.480]  going to be going after those resources spain has resources so basically they're they're draining
[01:27:44.480 --> 01:27:50.160]  these nations they're they're draining these nations of their public uh of their public treasury
[01:27:50.160 --> 01:27:54.960]  and that's what's happening and the you know when you're talking about 25 unemployment also
[01:27:54.960 --> 01:28:00.240]  means 50 unemployment among young people there's no future for them there's no future for them and
[01:28:00.240 --> 01:28:05.360]  this is and you know this is what happens then then we see like violence and global reaction
[01:28:05.360 --> 01:28:10.080]  wonder where does that come from uh you know you can only squeeze people oh yeah you watch davos
[01:28:10.080 --> 01:28:15.680]  and they've got soros's guy going it's terrible we need to redistribute wealth but they're talking
[01:28:15.680 --> 01:28:20.560]  about the middle class's money to the poor there is going to be no middle class where are all these
[01:28:20.560 --> 01:28:27.120]  robber barons going to live when they've imploded every nation well uh uh mark rich was in the
[01:28:27.120 --> 01:28:34.240]  move to switzerland after uh bill clinton gave uh the multi-billionaire bandit they uh pardon
[01:28:34.240 --> 01:28:39.600]  and so he lived there virtually uh tax-free uh there's a there's so that's what they're doing in the case
[01:28:39.600 --> 01:28:44.480]  of kenneth dart one of the guys who took down greece by the way kenneth dart was one it was a
[01:28:44.480 --> 01:28:49.440]  vulture investor here's an american or he was i shouldn't say i shouldn't call him an american
[01:28:49.440 --> 01:28:53.840]  because he'll probably sue me he was born in america his business he's the guy who makes a
[01:28:53.840 --> 01:28:58.720]  solo styrofoam cups and and he's made billions of dollars through stock market operations
[01:28:58.720 --> 01:29:06.320]  and and vulture tax on poor nations he gave up his american citizenship he took believes
[01:29:06.320 --> 01:29:10.720]  citizenship he's never been to believes in his life as i understand it but he's now the believes
[01:29:10.720 --> 01:29:16.720]  ambassador to the united states so he lives in the united states tax-free and immune from arrest
[01:29:17.600 --> 01:29:22.480]  because he's so called not is hopefully not an american citizen and as diplomatic community

[01:33:49.520 --> 01:33:53.920]  want to air uh one jacari jackson went out and talked to austin ice they know what the first
[01:33:53.920 --> 01:33:58.240]  amendment is that's coming up in the next hour i want to play this leon macadoo report
[01:33:58.800 --> 01:34:04.800]  could the greek collapse come here then you've got the austinites on average there were some smart
[01:34:04.800 --> 01:34:11.280]  folks but on average just thinking they're totally immune and insulated from it not as stupid as
[01:34:11.280 --> 01:34:15.600]  folks in southern california that you know eight out of ten nine out of ten don't know what independence
[01:34:15.600 --> 01:34:24.080]  day is but six out of ten here didn't so pretty darn close and again i take no relish meant out
[01:34:24.080 --> 01:34:30.880]  of this it's very very sad we point this out so that hopefully we can ignite some type of national
[01:34:30.880 --> 01:34:37.280]  debate about it just like that a national poll out yesterday that drudge had a link to 19 percent
[01:34:37.280 --> 01:34:43.440]  of americans know what the first amendment is so you wonder how the government can be run by foreign
[01:34:43.440 --> 01:34:48.320]  banks you wonder how we can sign on a secret tpp you wonder how we can be funding radical
[01:34:48.320 --> 01:34:54.720]  islamists is to run around and murder everybody and then take our rights at the same time to supposedly
[01:34:54.720 --> 01:35:01.840]  protect us from them it's because the public is dumbered in a box of rocks but that doesn't mean
[01:35:01.840 --> 01:35:08.880]  the minority of us of all race colors and creeds that are aware have to live under the governance
[01:35:08.880 --> 01:35:16.400]  of the idiots that's why we're a republic in a pure democracy if 51 percent say you die you die
[01:35:16.400 --> 01:35:21.680]  if 51 percent say take your farm you take your farm you know i think greek culture is very diverse
[01:35:21.680 --> 01:35:27.200]  very interesting a whole bunch of different islands and tribes and groups very smart people
[01:35:28.080 --> 01:35:34.640]  but they lionized democracy as the father of this country we're we're not a democracy we're a republic
[01:35:35.760 --> 01:35:42.480]  everybody uses that word like it's a sickeningly delicious in ancient Greece where they first
[01:35:43.040 --> 01:35:47.520]  in a few of the city states that first got democracy look it up they would have a one
[01:35:47.520 --> 01:35:55.120]  bucket for white stones one bucket for black stones and they would say this philosopher bad mouth the
[01:35:55.120 --> 01:36:03.360]  king um and we don't like that and so we're going to vote and only of course the gentry noble class
[01:36:03.360 --> 01:36:09.520]  was allowed to vote forgot that part it was an oligarchy a democracy of the oligarchy
[01:36:09.520 --> 01:36:21.840]  a demonocracy and they then would vote and if there were no votes to not kill there'd be
[01:36:21.840 --> 01:36:27.200]  more black stones put in the bucket but if there were more white stones put into kill they would
[01:36:27.200 --> 01:36:32.320]  make you drink hemlock or throw you off a cliff or strangle you they'd say oh we voted to kill you
[01:36:32.320 --> 01:36:38.640]  and many of the famous philosophers you know their names weren't killed by vote
[01:36:40.240 --> 01:36:45.200]  so you might want to find out about democracy and how deadly it is i mean they can get
[01:36:45.200 --> 01:36:51.760]  51 of the moron public to then vote to take my guns or take your private property or conscript
[01:36:51.760 --> 01:37:07.520]  our children or make us take vaccines no no no i want to go to your calls i i had misread the
[01:37:07.520 --> 01:37:12.160]  sheet i thought palace is on for an hour he had to go but we do have mr dent joining us he made
[01:37:12.160 --> 01:37:17.920]  the specific predictions about the stock market uh situation coming up j johnson the head of homeland
[01:37:17.920 --> 01:37:23.680]  security is up there giving speeches about imminent cyber attacks uh and we need to pass
[01:37:23.680 --> 01:37:32.080]  government takeover of the internet and a handover of that uh that's happening right now uh on c span
[01:37:33.280 --> 01:37:41.520]  and then separately we've got the cyber security stocks all racing up uh on the uh nasdaq after
[01:37:41.520 --> 01:37:47.040]  the stock market was closed cyber security stocks surged on the back of big new york stock exchange
[01:37:47.040 --> 01:37:53.520]  trading halt i'm not saying this was a cyber attack but it's very suspicious either a cyber attack
[01:37:53.520 --> 01:37:58.160]  or they halted trading to stop a route it's probably halted trading to stop a route and
[01:37:58.160 --> 01:38:03.600]  are just fear mongering on the back of it implying it could be a cyber attack that's probably what went
[01:38:03.600 --> 01:38:09.840]  on here but united airlines got taken down today uh the wall street journal had an issue today let's
[01:38:09.840 --> 01:38:16.320]  put that up there uh wall street journal home page is down as nasdaq stops trading i mean there's a
[01:38:16.320 --> 01:38:24.160]  bunch of weirdness going on right now there is a whole bunch of weirdness uh going on and
[01:38:24.160 --> 01:38:30.240]  happening and taking place right now as chinese stocks are now down more than 40 percent we'll
[01:38:30.240 --> 01:38:37.280]  give you the latest here in a moment now i want to give this leon macadoo uh report again this is
[01:38:37.280 --> 01:38:42.800]  two days ago in austin this is the nightly news monday and she went out and and was trying to
[01:38:42.800 --> 01:38:52.560]  ask people hey do you think a stock collapse could come here and as usual they don't really most
[01:38:52.560 --> 01:38:59.440]  of them answer a question they just go off some of them into blaming the greeks when i bet bottom
[01:38:59.440 --> 01:39:06.400]  dollar if you didn't label the greek aisles on a map on a world map on a globe i bet you they
[01:39:06.400 --> 01:39:14.480]  couldn't find it i bet you all the money that isn't in the private federal reserve all the fiat
[01:39:14.480 --> 01:39:20.000]  money in the in the world that they can't find their rear end with both hands so let's go ahead
[01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:25.760]  and go to leon macadoo uh talking to austin ice what do you think about what's going on in greeks
[01:39:25.760 --> 01:39:30.720]  do you think something like that could happen here well of course it's happening in Puerto Rico
[01:39:30.720 --> 01:39:36.640]  that's kind of here yeah so yeah absolutely absolutely uh i mean especially with the imf the
[01:39:36.640 --> 01:39:41.760]  way they handle things so i think it's it's it's very possible how would you feel if the banks
[01:39:41.760 --> 01:39:46.880]  were shut down here for a week and they were you could only take out about 60 a day i think most
[01:39:46.880 --> 01:39:53.440]  people would be panicked i would try to plan for something like that but i i think a lot of people
[01:39:53.440 --> 01:39:59.600]  would panic i'd be pissed off that is a very good question what will we all do how would your business
[01:39:59.600 --> 01:40:05.840]  survive or thrive if people weren't able to get cash out of the bank well i personally think that it's
[01:40:05.840 --> 01:40:10.880]  a real tragedy that you would have a country that would go bankrupt that once had money
[01:40:10.880 --> 01:40:16.080]  and don't have any money but a business like mine would would uh would just die there and bless
[01:40:16.080 --> 01:40:22.000]  our heart we're we're we're generous people and we want to make sure that our citizens are happy
[01:40:22.000 --> 01:40:29.040]  but there's a warning out there someplace that you know there is a limit on how much money you
[01:40:29.040 --> 01:40:36.080]  can borrow and still pay it back on time right and as far as i know you can't borrow money without
[01:40:36.080 --> 01:40:42.160]  paying interest on it the boss unless you're a bank they're going to i love that but back it up this
[01:40:42.160 --> 01:40:47.760]  guy's in his fancy suit and he's going we're nice to our citizens but there's a limit on what we can
[01:40:47.760 --> 01:40:52.720]  give them the greeks didn't get to vote to join the euro the euro was designed to predatorily
[01:40:52.720 --> 01:40:59.680]  come in and take over grease bailed out the euro and now that's their debt so you don't bail out the
[01:40:59.680 --> 01:41:08.080]  megabanks and then you're out of debt you're in debt and they're not and they have the financial
[01:41:08.080 --> 01:41:13.600]  shows bad mouth you and convince people like this fellow that you're somehow a bad person
[01:41:15.920 --> 01:41:20.080]  and yes they socialize things so people are dependent on the state so that things are
[01:41:20.080 --> 01:41:26.640]  they're communalized in a collective system so people will stick with the system even as it's
[01:41:26.640 --> 01:41:31.360]  designed to bring them down because they're invested in it i mean corporate welfare is the
[01:41:31.360 --> 01:41:37.280]  majority of welfare and i love the fake conservatives that are always up there going oh yeah it's all
[01:41:37.280 --> 01:41:41.760]  these lazy people that's why we've got a banking crisis we have a banking crisis because they
[01:41:41.760 --> 01:41:47.120]  created fake derivatives by the thousands of trillions of dollars and got the municipal
[01:41:47.120 --> 01:41:55.120]  county city state federal international groups to invest in them it's the fiat fraud is why we're
[01:41:55.120 --> 01:42:01.040]  in so much trouble the socialism is bad but that's to keep you on the hook and get you dependent
[01:42:01.840 --> 01:42:07.920]  it's only part of the problem not the big enchilada that's why i'm against it but it's not the scapegoat
[01:42:09.360 --> 01:42:12.800]  let's go ahead but i love people that aren't part of the system always act like they're a power
[01:42:12.800 --> 01:42:18.400]  trip well we've given them so much and now they're just lazy like you're part of the establishment
[01:42:18.400 --> 01:42:25.440]  because you're wearing a orval red and bocker outfit let's go back to him and bless our heart
[01:42:25.440 --> 01:42:31.280]  we're we're we're generous people and we want to make sure that our citizens are happy but
[01:42:31.280 --> 01:42:38.160]  there's a warning out there someplace that you know there is a limit on how much money you can
[01:42:38.160 --> 01:42:44.960]  borrow and still pay it back on time right and as far as i know you can't borrow money without
[01:42:44.960 --> 01:42:50.560]  paying interest on it well unless you're a bank they're going to start looking at ways to kind
[01:42:50.560 --> 01:42:56.240]  of pay the banks keep them solvent which will be taking 30 percent a little haircut out of people's
[01:42:56.240 --> 01:43:02.160]  savings accounts anyone who has about 8 000 euros in their account should be okay given a little
[01:43:02.160 --> 01:43:07.040]  haircut to the banks uh it doesn't sound right because that's the money that i've saved i don't
[01:43:07.040 --> 01:43:13.040]  have a savings account i keep my money at home would you be okay pushing back your retirement
[01:43:13.040 --> 01:43:17.120]  so that the banks could get paid even though it was the banks that were doing the risky
[01:43:17.120 --> 01:43:24.320]  trading and everything i wouldn't have a whole lot to give but you know whatever they take that i
[01:43:24.320 --> 01:43:31.040]  wouldn't be very cool about back it up again to the look on that guy's face because here he is this
[01:43:31.040 --> 01:43:36.160]  isn't fit the narrative of cnn and fox news where she's like but it's the mega banks that got the
[01:43:36.160 --> 01:43:39.680]  trillions they're the ones that don't have to pay interest they're the ones that can leverage it 10
[01:43:39.680 --> 01:43:44.560]  to 1 fractional reserve and beyond that would do derivatives and he's like who because he was all
[01:43:44.560 --> 01:43:50.720]  about him feeling powerful over her and him just guessing she's a dumb liberal because she's a woman
[01:43:50.720 --> 01:43:56.960]  and and and lecturing her when the truth is i talked to major executives and ceo's they can't
[01:43:56.960 --> 01:44:02.000]  find their butts with both hands they know their little market their little company their little
[01:44:02.000 --> 01:44:07.840]  trend they don't have general knowledge and i'm not up here glad that you're so ignorant but the so
[01:44:07.840 --> 01:44:13.360]  called smart people are some of the dumbest ones around let's go back to it would you be okay pushing
[01:44:13.360 --> 01:44:17.920]  back your retirement so that the banks could get paid even though it was the banks that were doing
[01:44:17.920 --> 01:44:25.120]  the risky trading and everything i wouldn't have a whole lot to give but you know whatever they
[01:44:25.120 --> 01:44:30.480]  take that i wouldn't be very cool about it yeah exactly they might need to take some austerity
[01:44:30.480 --> 01:44:36.560]  measures which ones at what level it's way beyond me to know do you think that the greek people are
[01:44:36.560 --> 01:44:40.640]  just greedy because they're just addicted to all this welfare that's been coming their way or do
[01:44:40.640 --> 01:44:45.920]  you think it's the banks that are being greedy well if the greek people are countries who are
[01:44:45.920 --> 01:44:52.800]  controlled i call that aristocracy and that of democracy that's owned by the bank so they don't
[01:44:52.800 --> 01:44:57.520]  really have any options i don't know that much about it but i know if you're borrowing money
[01:44:57.520 --> 01:45:02.880]  you ought to pay it back do you give one of our 50 states a credit card and they default on it so
[01:45:02.880 --> 01:45:08.080]  the rest of the states have to suffer it i think we should leave them on their own they've been spending
[01:45:08.880 --> 01:45:14.640]  recklessly for years and now it's uh i tend to err on the side of kindness and let's help a brother
[01:45:14.640 --> 01:45:18.560]  out but this is not the first time they've been in this situation either it wasn't actually the
[01:45:18.560 --> 01:45:24.720]  greeks who borrowed the money and who got the benefit of the borrowed money it's the people with
[01:45:24.720 --> 01:45:31.040]  the pension this the government employees all benefited from that borrowed money that's how
[01:45:31.040 --> 01:45:35.920]  they got paid what they got that's how they got the pensions they got that's how they get you on the
[01:45:35.920 --> 01:45:42.160]  book so they are the benefactors of the borrowed money a bailout might bring restrictions that they
[01:45:42.160 --> 01:45:47.040]  don't want it's going to be back in the same position they were but on the other hand if it
[01:45:47.040 --> 01:45:57.280]  causes the entire world stage to start to fall yeah is it best for them maybe not the government
[01:45:57.280 --> 01:46:04.240]  borrowed the money on their behalf they were the beneficiaries you can't borrow money and get all
[01:46:04.240 --> 01:46:10.640]  the advantages that borrowed money and not pay it back so you're telling me that you can make me
[01:46:10.640 --> 01:46:16.960]  hungry but the government is okay because they own the company well that's not right yeah that's communism
[01:46:16.960 --> 01:46:23.040]  they do not get a free lunch i couldn't figure out how they would allow themselves to go bankrupt
[01:46:23.040 --> 01:46:26.720]  because they will go broke and usually they're too greedy to go broke but i can go broke or
[01:46:26.720 --> 01:46:31.680]  somebody else is paying for it there will be some pain involved
[01:46:31.680 --> 01:46:40.880]  yeah that's that guy that's going to have some pain another arrogant and know-it-all pseudo
[01:46:40.880 --> 01:46:47.040]  intellectual makes you want to throw up let me explain this to uh orville red and bacher wearing
[01:46:47.040 --> 01:46:55.760]  his pre-1929 uh outfit his dandy outfit i think it's fitting that he's he's he's wearing a depression
[01:46:55.760 --> 01:47:04.400]  era get up maybe 20 the blame goes on the greek government the socialists being set up and wanting
[01:47:04.400 --> 01:47:09.120]  some goodies and wanting to live outside their means the general public does it owe it you don't
[01:47:09.120 --> 01:47:13.920]  come right into people's bank accounts and have foreign international banks threatened to cut
[01:47:13.920 --> 01:47:18.880]  off food being shipped in that you that you're going to pay for if you default on the euro plan
[01:47:18.880 --> 01:47:27.600]  the euro and the united states collectively are more than two-thirds of the 2.2 quadrillion
[01:47:27.600 --> 01:47:37.040]  in derivatives 2008 and these nations going into debt here and in europe most of the debt over 70
[01:47:37.040 --> 01:47:45.120]  percent was just in the bailouts alone where trillions of dollars was given to prop up the
[01:47:45.120 --> 01:47:52.880]  banks that now sit here lecturing us and boy she got his attention when she said well should they
[01:47:52.880 --> 01:47:59.280]  take some of the money out of your bank account to prop this up and he goes there may need to be
[01:47:59.280 --> 01:48:04.640]  some austerity measures then later he's going there's going to be some pain for greece and he
[01:48:04.640 --> 01:48:10.240]  just smiles and gets off on it and that guy's probably got like 20 people that work for him
[01:48:10.240 --> 01:48:14.640]  and i've run to these folks the opposite of capitalism they just get off on their petty
[01:48:14.640 --> 01:48:20.240]  power and then imagine they're part of the new world order because you know they go to a dinner

[01:54:30.160 --> 01:54:37.680]  reclaim your democracy in front of outraged e u bureaucrats and more in fact speaking of nizel
[01:54:37.680 --> 01:54:43.680]  farage the leader of the libertarian movement in europe here is an excerpt of that powerful
[01:54:43.680 --> 01:54:48.960]  speech yesterday now mr farage for the fd group thank you what we're seeing in this chamber this
[01:54:48.960 --> 01:54:55.120]  morning and indeed across the whole of europe is an irreconcilable cultural difference between
[01:54:55.120 --> 01:55:01.840]  greece and germany a split between the north and the south of europe europe the european project
[01:55:01.840 --> 01:55:07.840]  is actually beginning to die nobody in this room will recognize that but actually the peoples of
[01:55:07.840 --> 01:55:15.040]  europe are saying we were never asked whether we wanted this this has been foisted upon us
[01:55:15.040 --> 01:55:22.560]  and we need to understand why emu doesn't work those monsters kohl and miterrand backed up
[01:55:22.560 --> 01:55:28.400]  with a clever but dangerous to law believed that if they put in place an economic and monetary union
[01:55:28.960 --> 01:55:35.120]  then as night follows day there would be political union that there would be an acceptance of this
[01:55:35.120 --> 01:55:42.000]  project that the north and south of europe would converge that we'd all start to love each other
[01:55:42.000 --> 01:55:48.240]  that we'd all begin to feel a european identity that we'd all begin to show allegiance to the flag
[01:55:48.240 --> 01:55:54.080]  and the anthem those of us of course that criticized this were told that we were extremists
[01:55:54.080 --> 01:56:01.280]  and we lacked vision well one vision we didn't lack is we understood that the countries of europe
[01:56:01.280 --> 01:56:07.280]  are different and that if you try and force together different people or different economies
[01:56:07.280 --> 01:56:14.640]  without first seeking the consent of those people it is unlikely to work and the plan has failed
[01:56:15.200 --> 01:56:20.480]  this isn't just Greece we're talking about today the whole of the Mediterranean now finds itself
[01:56:20.480 --> 01:56:27.280]  in the wrong currency and yet virtually nobody in the political arena has got the courage to stand
[01:56:27.280 --> 01:56:33.520]  up and say that indeed i feel that the continent is now divided from north to south there is a new
[01:56:33.520 --> 01:56:41.840]  berlin wall and it's called the euro and the old emnities have been resumed just listen to the way
[01:56:41.840 --> 01:56:47.920]  the german leader of the christian democrat group this morning attacked mr spiras i think it was
[01:56:47.920 --> 01:56:54.960]  absolutely disgusting but it shows the way it shows the way north and south now feel about each other
[01:56:55.600 --> 01:57:00.640]  uh mr syrpras your your country should never have joined the euro i think you've acknowledged that
[01:57:00.640 --> 01:57:06.640]  but the big banks the big businesses and big politics forced you in goldman sacks the german
[01:57:06.640 --> 01:57:11.440]  arms manufacturers they were all very happy and when the bailouts began they weren't for the
[01:57:11.440 --> 01:57:17.360]  greek people those bailouts were the bailout french german and italian banks that's right they
[01:57:17.360 --> 01:57:23.600]  haven't helped you at all and these years of austerity these years of high unemployment of
[01:57:23.600 --> 01:57:30.480]  increasing poverty none of its worked in fact your your debt gdp ratio has gone from 100 percent at
[01:57:30.480 --> 01:57:38.160]  the start of the crisis to 180 percent right now it would be madness sir to continue on this course
[01:57:38.160 --> 01:57:43.920]  you have been very brave you called that referendum when one of your predecessors tried to do the same
[01:57:43.920 --> 01:57:49.760]  the bully boys of brussels had him removed they tried their best again mr unka said you would
[01:57:49.760 --> 01:57:55.040]  have to leave the euro and leave the european union even mr schultz the president of the parliament
[01:57:55.040 --> 01:58:00.320]  who wanted to fault might be neutral said that if the greeks voted no their power supplies
[01:58:00.320 --> 01:58:07.120]  may even go down there were threats and bullying but the greeks confirmed but sir you cannot have
[01:58:07.120 --> 01:58:13.360]  your cake and eat it they will give you no more these people they can't afford to if they give you
[01:58:13.360 --> 01:58:18.800]  more they'll have to give other eurozone members more so your moment has come and frankly if you've
[01:58:18.800 --> 01:58:26.240]  got the courage you should lead the greek people out of the eurozone with your head held high get back

[02:02:51.120 --> 02:02:57.040]  diverse distribution of power through the vote of the dollar through the vote of free association
[02:02:57.040 --> 02:03:06.560]  and to build the world according to performance and review and free association people who don't
[02:03:06.560 --> 02:03:11.520]  know history haven't traveled the world that sit around bitching about america i mean you're idiots
[02:03:11.520 --> 02:03:18.400]  you're morons they talk about dangerous rand paul is a real deal i don't know about other people
[02:03:18.400 --> 02:03:24.080]  up there i like some of stuff cruz does but i i just don't know him rand paul is the real deal
[02:03:24.080 --> 02:03:30.640]  and he has come out against hillary which is very very dangerous uh i mean i mean the clinton's
[02:03:30.640 --> 02:03:35.440]  will blow you up an airplane i mean they're murdering mafias come let's go to this clip i find it
[02:03:35.440 --> 02:03:39.920]  very hard to believe that hillary clinton didn't know in fact she was the biggest cheerleader
[02:03:39.920 --> 02:03:45.680]  for sending these arms and redistributing these arms into syrian rebels and the reason why this
[02:03:45.680 --> 02:03:50.720]  is an important issue many of the people who receive these arms are not friends of america
[02:03:50.720 --> 02:03:56.800]  many of them are linked to al-qaeda al-nusrah and some of these weapons may well may well have wound
[02:03:56.800 --> 02:04:02.400]  up in the hands of people who became ices so this is no small fact whether or she not she told the
[02:04:02.400 --> 02:04:08.720]  truth is a big deal and some of the emails coming out about about ben gazi indicate that maybe she
[02:04:08.720 --> 02:04:13.920]  did know a lot more about this arms and she let on and i don't think our our public officials
[02:04:13.920 --> 02:04:18.480]  should be allowed to come before congressional committees and lie but it's also concerning
[02:04:18.480 --> 02:04:23.040]  because the big problem we face now with ices did it have anything to do with hillary clinton
[02:04:23.040 --> 02:04:28.640]  arming people who either became ices or who were friends or allies of ices you dropped the l word
[02:04:28.640 --> 02:04:33.360]  was she lying senator is that what you're saying i think there's a very good chance because i think
[02:04:33.360 --> 02:04:38.720]  there's no way that hillary clinton did not know about this her private email so that she was the
[02:04:38.720 --> 02:04:42.400]  one supporting of course here's the ramp all knows a lot more than he's saying obviously
[02:04:42.400 --> 02:04:45.920]  he's the one other than this show that helped expose with tosh plumley and others
[02:04:45.920 --> 02:04:50.320]  was really going on colonel schaefer and we need to pray for all these people including me
[02:04:50.320 --> 02:04:54.560]  i mean i'm i'm i'm not saying i'm a hero here i'm just doing my job but let me tell you this is
[02:04:54.560 --> 02:05:03.600]  dangerous don't take this for granted from bio weapons and genetic modification to autonomous
[02:05:03.600 --> 02:05:08.080]  killing machines and the surveillance state engineers and scientists are busy creating
[02:05:08.080 --> 02:05:14.320]  technologies that could result in billions of people dying or living as slaves michael creighton
[02:05:14.320 --> 02:05:20.320]  put it this way 25 years ago in jurassic park their technicians they don't have intelligence
[02:05:20.320 --> 02:05:26.320]  they have what i call thin intelligence they see the immediate situation they think narrowly and they
[02:05:26.320 --> 02:05:32.320]  call it being focused they don't see the surround they don't see the consequences that's how you get
[02:05:32.320 --> 02:05:37.920]  an island like jurassic park from thin intelligent thinking because you can't make an animal and not
[02:05:37.920 --> 02:05:44.960]  expect it to act alive to be unpredictable to escape but they don't see that i always said
[02:05:44.960 --> 02:05:55.040]  you want to turn back the clock no i can say i want people to wake up so do i for info wars.com

[02:06:06.960 --> 02:06:12.480]  because the companies i've been approached by were not the highest quality and they weren't as

[02:08:21.280 --> 02:08:26.320]  well harry dense been coming on with us for about five years he's been a more frequent guest
[02:08:26.320 --> 02:08:34.960]  in the latest round of crises he predicted years ago that china would probably be the trigger contagion
[02:08:34.960 --> 02:08:40.480]  for a global stock market a meltdown that the bond market's ready to go ron paul's been seconding
[02:08:40.480 --> 02:08:46.560]  what he has to say so many other guests we have on have also been warning of this but he specifically
[02:08:46.560 --> 02:08:53.760]  has been saying china's the big issue not greece harry dent dot com his new book is out is already
[02:08:53.760 --> 02:09:00.640]  a bestseller the demographic cliff harry dent research dot com harry dent dot com forward slash
[02:09:00.640 --> 02:09:08.400]  alex jones to find some really good deals on his book uh but he joins us uh right now to give us
[02:09:08.400 --> 02:09:13.840]  his breakdown just for the next 30 minutes then i'm going to go to walt carl jerald truth brandon
[02:09:13.840 --> 02:09:17.840]  and others that are patiently holding in fact you might get to talk to him if we have if we have
[02:09:17.840 --> 02:09:23.840]  time but i wanted to get him on because still the new york stock exchange is closed uh clearly the
[02:09:23.840 --> 02:09:29.040]  computers kicked in when there was a total plunge to turn it off it's on record they do that they're
[02:09:29.040 --> 02:09:35.440]  lying saying that uh it was just a glitch uh normally when they have a stock holiday a market
[02:09:35.440 --> 02:09:40.400]  holiday they just admit it this is part of the new wall of deception uh now they're saying it could
[02:09:40.400 --> 02:09:47.360]  be a cyber attack that articles on info wars dot com i don't really buy that cyber stocks are up
[02:09:47.360 --> 02:09:53.360]  around the world right now china's stock market's down more than 40 right now that's basically epic
[02:09:53.360 --> 02:10:01.440]  level freefall and we're going over the demographic cliff right now as we go into the middle area of
[02:10:01.440 --> 02:10:06.560]  baby boomers already they've been retiring for four or five years but now the big group is retiring
[02:10:07.600 --> 02:10:15.280]  and uh we have obama with obama care that's just designed to stall the economy uh you've got attempts
[02:10:15.280 --> 02:10:21.120]  to start wars with russia uh you've got all the saber rattling with china my concern historically
[02:10:21.120 --> 02:10:25.440]  with demographics dent can compare the correct me if i'm wrong because he he goes off a bunch of
[02:10:25.440 --> 02:10:33.680]  different spectrums uh and and different indicators gauges that war comes next uh so we'll get his
[02:10:33.680 --> 02:10:40.000]  breakdown former one of the top analysts and uh guys over at bayne capital uh i won't go over his
[02:10:40.000 --> 02:10:45.760]  whole uh background or bio but he joins us right now harry dent research dot com or harry dent dot
[02:10:45.760 --> 02:10:52.160]  com wow harry well you called it uh over and over again for how many years that it would be china
[02:10:52.160 --> 02:10:58.960]  and i think this signals maybe i'm wrong the beginning of uh massive correction that you've
[02:10:58.960 --> 02:11:04.400]  been warning of so speak about china what you think's going on with the u.s stock market the
[02:11:04.400 --> 02:11:09.680]  new york stock exchange being closed do you agree with me do you have any intel and then what's the
[02:11:09.680 --> 02:11:17.280]  next shoe to drop well you know china led the last breakdown in late 2007 2008 it was ahead
[02:11:17.280 --> 02:11:21.920]  of the u.s market and we've also been warning people alex that you've got you got to get out of
[02:11:21.920 --> 02:11:28.480]  these bubbles early because the first crash is typically 30 to 40 percent within a month or two
[02:11:28.480 --> 02:11:31.840]  and people don't have time to get out they say well i'll get out when it starts the week i know
[02:11:31.840 --> 02:11:36.400]  it's too late when it happens in a bubble like this and i there's there's going to be a round of
[02:11:36.400 --> 02:11:40.480]  things we got to look for i think the chinese market will probably bounce pretty soon they're
[02:11:40.480 --> 02:11:46.640]  doing some pathetic just desperate things they stepped in this weekend with 20 billion dollars
[02:11:46.640 --> 02:11:52.720]  and bought stocks to prop them up artificially they told all major pension funds in china they
[02:11:52.720 --> 02:11:57.200]  cannot sell stocks they can only buy and they can't sell them talking about the manipulation
[02:11:57.200 --> 02:12:04.240]  of the market um and and and now 40 you know 40 of their top companies are not even trading
[02:12:04.240 --> 02:12:09.360]  because they can't afford to keep falling so at some point we'll see this first wave down
[02:12:09.360 --> 02:12:13.520]  and what people should look for as you get a bounce and it only lasts a couple of weeks or
[02:12:13.520 --> 02:12:18.720]  maybe a couple months and then china starts heading down uh the next thing we see greek
[02:12:18.720 --> 02:12:24.960]  is in greece is in trouble porto rico's next then portugal uh chicago and illinois are in
[02:12:24.960 --> 02:12:30.640]  trouble but i've been warning on this show that the the first real critical thing to happen in
[02:12:30.640 --> 02:12:36.240]  watch 40 united states is oil drops again and it's already dropped from 62 to 51 box in a few weeks
[02:12:36.960 --> 02:12:43.280]  and and that triggers a round of defaults with the fracking industry the fracking industry is a
[02:12:43.280 --> 02:12:51.280]  trillion dollar investment has created tons of job and has 600 billion of high risk high yield
[02:12:51.920 --> 02:12:56.800]  i know a bunch of people that are in the oil industry low level mid level small company
[02:12:56.800 --> 02:13:03.360]  owners they're all fighting bankruptcy are going bankrupt as we speak how bad is this going to wound
[02:13:03.360 --> 02:13:11.200]  texas oklahoma the dakotas uh and canada it's going to particularly hit texas north dakota
[02:13:11.200 --> 02:13:16.160]  and alberta and canada because that's where most of this is concentrated and again most
[02:13:16.160 --> 02:13:23.600]  these uh frackers and and oil sands people can't can't break even um unless oil's over 80 dollars
[02:13:23.600 --> 02:13:30.080]  or at least over 55 10 to 20 in the next next several years so this is there what they're doing
[02:13:30.080 --> 02:13:35.520]  is they're pumping their existing wells to the max to create cash flow because their wells are
[02:13:35.520 --> 02:13:40.560]  is not it's not expensive to pump it's expensive to find the darn things and drill and they were
[02:13:40.560 --> 02:13:45.440]  only able to do that with the cheapest junk bonds in history because of quantitative easing and
[02:13:45.440 --> 02:13:50.560]  artificial stimulus and by oil price so so that's the next thing to hit the united state
[02:13:50.560 --> 02:13:56.800]  but here's the real thing the the biggest bubble in china is not the stock market by the way it
[02:13:56.800 --> 02:14:02.160]  went up 160 percent in less than a year and has fallen near 40 percent here in just a matter of
[02:14:02.160 --> 02:14:08.560]  a month but but the chinese save way more money than us they have no social net and welfare and
[02:14:08.560 --> 02:14:14.240]  stuff and they've always saved more because they've been poor and even the rich saved 75 percent of
[02:14:14.240 --> 02:14:18.720]  their income the everyday 55 percent and guess where they put it they put it mostly in the real
[02:14:18.720 --> 02:14:26.160]  estate way more than the us or europe so realist the reason the stock bubble happened was in the
[02:14:26.160 --> 02:14:30.720]  last year real estate finally started to cave but the government's been supporting that and
[02:14:30.720 --> 02:14:36.080]  propping that up artificially they've been buying empty condos like crazy but when real estate stopped
[02:14:36.080 --> 02:14:41.280]  going up then people started speculating in stocks which the chinese don't normally do and that's why
[02:14:41.280 --> 02:14:45.840]  they got such a crazy bubble and two-thirds of the new accounts were opened by people who didn't
[02:14:45.840 --> 02:14:51.360]  have a high school education so this is really dumb money and that's why it's failing so fast
[02:14:51.360 --> 02:14:57.600]  so but it's when the chinese real estate market finally gets hit harder like Singapore has recently
[02:14:57.600 --> 02:15:03.360]  here boy when that happens the implosion of wealth in the second largest and fastest growing country
[02:15:03.360 --> 02:15:08.320]  in the world is going to be unbelievable it's going to be like the japanese in the early 90s when
[02:15:08.320 --> 02:15:13.120]  their real estate bubbles imploded they stopped buying real estate everywhere and they were the
[02:15:13.120 --> 02:15:18.560]  lead buyers in in the key city so so you're saying i mean to be specific you're saying you think we'll
[02:15:18.560 --> 02:15:24.960]  have a dead cat bounce out of china and for a few months and then as we go into the fall uh use you
[02:15:24.960 --> 02:15:30.720]  think it's going to go down yes yeah and the same thing with we've had a dead cat bounce and oil is
[02:15:30.720 --> 02:15:36.160]  starting to go down when oil gets back in the low 40s people are going to realize these frackers are
[02:15:36.160 --> 02:15:39.760]  dead and they're going to have to the fall everybody's listening to tea boon pickings and
[02:15:39.760 --> 02:15:45.440]  people saying oh oil be back to 80 dollars for you know it's not going to be the leading experts
[02:15:45.440 --> 02:15:51.120]  and in princes and saudi arabia said we will never see a hundred dollar oil again and i agree with
[02:15:51.120 --> 02:15:57.040]  that at least for many decades i don't know about ever uh so yeah i mean china bubble bursting and
[02:15:57.040 --> 02:16:02.160]  and the fracking bubble bursting are the two biggest things i sure here's my question and almost
[02:16:02.160 --> 02:16:07.840]  everything you said has been right on for 20 years but but but here's my concern i get that we're
[02:16:07.840 --> 02:16:15.600]  going into a depression people retiring less money debts are huge that causes a real economy
[02:16:15.600 --> 02:16:21.040]  depression prices should fall but things are so rigged and they're still going ahead with qe
[02:16:21.040 --> 02:16:28.320]  unlimited all over the world i i don't see how down the road other commodities like gold and
[02:16:28.320 --> 02:16:35.760]  silver don't go up especially when so many elitist and institutions are quietly buying gold or is
[02:16:35.760 --> 02:16:40.640]  that not as an investment this is an emergency backup yeah but they're they're doing emergency
[02:16:40.640 --> 02:16:45.440]  buying of stocks and it didn't work in 1929 for long and it's not going to work in china but
[02:16:45.440 --> 02:16:52.320]  down the road commodities are going to be big and i think i do see gold at 5000 but it's like 15 to
[02:16:52.320 --> 02:16:58.720]  the 30 20 years from now we have to go through this deflation first when when you get a bubble burst
[02:16:58.720 --> 02:17:06.560]  i'd elix there are 225 trillion dollars of loans bonds stocks financial assets
[02:17:06.560 --> 02:17:11.520]  around the globe now and that's gone way up with these bubbles 100 trillion of that could
[02:17:11.520 --> 02:17:17.120]  disappear overnight that is real wealth and money to people real estate could fall that's not even
[02:17:17.120 --> 02:17:21.520]  counted and it will oh yeah people lose most their savings and everything it is going to be a hellish
[02:17:21.520 --> 02:17:27.280]  pullback we will be a long here's my concern how bad will this depression be because i don't want
[02:17:27.280 --> 02:17:34.080]  to scare people but i've confirmed the military storing food police departments are digging in
[02:17:34.080 --> 02:17:38.560]  they're getting armored vehicles delivered that's admitted i've got the ministry of defense in the
[02:17:38.560 --> 02:17:43.920]  pentagon zone declassified reports where they believe a collapse is coming by 2017 and they said
[02:17:43.920 --> 02:17:49.360]  that eight years ago so quietly they agree with you but how bad could this collapse be i mean
[02:17:49.360 --> 02:17:54.080]  we're talking about something far worse than 2008 aren't we yeah well it's definitely going to be
[02:17:54.080 --> 02:18:01.120]  worse in 2008 every crash has been worse since 2000 crash we had a series of crashes and to me
[02:18:01.840 --> 02:18:06.720]  you you don't really see how bad it's going to be until you actually see debts fail and major
[02:18:06.720 --> 02:18:13.440]  defaults and loans going bad and in 70 80 percent crashes and major stock markets and that's exactly
[02:18:13.440 --> 02:18:17.760]  what happened in the early 30s so i think this is going to be like the early 30s and i think it's
[02:18:17.760 --> 02:18:23.280]  it's going to be much worse because governments have now kept this bubble going with quantitative
[02:18:23.280 --> 02:18:28.960]  easing artificial stimulus zero interest rates long and short term when you adjust for inflation
[02:18:28.960 --> 02:18:35.280]  they kept this thing going for six more years so the it's like taking more of a drug to keep
[02:18:35.280 --> 02:18:41.200]  from going down the longer you take the drug the worse your collapse is when you find you can handle
[02:18:41.200 --> 02:18:45.920]  a couple of Detroit's but what if we have 20 of them doesn't this become almost a road warrior
[02:18:45.920 --> 02:18:51.200]  scenario in many areas well it does that's what happened people say grease is no big thing grease
[02:18:51.200 --> 02:18:56.480]  is small but it's the first major country or entity to default and when that happens people
[02:18:56.480 --> 02:19:01.600]  start looking for defaults all that next elsewhere and the bond markets get jittery and interest
[02:19:01.600 --> 02:19:08.880]  rates go off we'll take a canary a canary small in a coal mine but you watch it it's a trigger
[02:19:08.880 --> 02:19:16.800]  and again this the subprime prices was the trigger for the last crunch in 2008 in the us we triggered
[02:19:16.800 --> 02:19:23.360]  the whole world crisis in four states so it wasn't that big and and and the fracking industry alone
[02:19:23.360 --> 02:19:29.040]  is almost as big as that subprime crisis so we got a whole bunch of triggers whole bunch of triggers
[02:19:29.040 --> 02:19:35.600]  Greece Portugal China bubble stock bubble real estate bubbles Singapore is already going down
[02:19:35.600 --> 02:19:39.680]  you know yeah there's tons of trigger and the government is running around like a chicken with
[02:19:39.680 --> 02:19:44.880]  its head cut off batting down the hatches yeah and we've been saying hey they'll just keep doing QE
[02:19:44.880 --> 02:19:49.920]  until something goes wrong but they lose control and the worst thing right now is long-term rates
[02:19:49.920 --> 02:19:56.320]  from Germany to Japan to the US and of course Greece are going up now despite runaway QE
[02:19:56.320 --> 02:20:00.480]  uh stay there explain that test when we come back have you ever wondered if you could make

[02:24:16.240 --> 02:24:22.240]  specials on his book the demographic cliff and more and he looks at a whole bunch of different
[02:24:22.240 --> 02:24:27.760]  demographic trends throughout history history doesn't repeat it rhymes i forget who said that
[02:24:27.760 --> 02:24:34.160]  but it does repeat itself over and over again and what about my question about war because we're
[02:24:34.160 --> 02:24:37.200]  going to come back in the next segment and take calls you've agreed to do that i appreciate it
[02:24:37.200 --> 02:24:43.120]  from brandon and others but but what about historically uh in every culture at every time
[02:24:43.120 --> 02:24:48.400]  when there's an economic crisis with the aztecs or an economic crisis with the romans or domestic
[02:24:48.400 --> 02:24:53.680]  problems in england or domestic problems in france or domestic problems in europe and or
[02:24:53.680 --> 02:25:00.160]  in world war one world war two always we end up going to war so i don't find it to be a surprise
[02:25:00.160 --> 02:25:07.280]  that we see massive escalations uh in conflict and in potential conflict in this season what are
[02:25:07.280 --> 02:25:14.000]  your graphs and charts that you have on your site that you go over uh say about war well two things
[02:25:14.000 --> 02:25:19.600]  the world war two the greatest war in history followed the great depression the great depression
[02:25:19.600 --> 02:25:25.760]  and the hyperinflation in the early 20s in in germany set up hitler to ride people were very
[02:25:25.760 --> 02:25:31.520]  dissatisfied and so when he said hey we're doing hardly but hey the way we can grow is to go attack
[02:25:31.520 --> 02:25:37.680]  everybody else people like yeah yeah why not so that was a big trigger for that and the my thing
[02:25:37.680 --> 02:25:44.720]  we have a geopolitical cycle that is positive for 18 years like 83 to 2000 and negative from 9 11
[02:25:44.720 --> 02:25:51.120]  through early 2020 if we're going to see increasing conflict in the middle east which is already obvious
[02:25:51.120 --> 02:25:56.960]  in other parts of the world and greater tensions between let's say china and japan russian us anything
[02:25:56.960 --> 02:26:02.240]  else question your it's going to happen and they're likely to happen in the next five years i don't
[02:26:02.240 --> 02:26:08.240]  think it's quite going to be as much like world war two only because we don't have the same alignment
[02:26:08.240 --> 02:26:12.400]  of major powers that can fight each other there's nobody that can fully challenge the united states
[02:26:12.400 --> 02:26:18.240]  because china's whole military efforts and defense spending is met on controlling their own people
[02:26:18.240 --> 02:26:24.240]  because they're not a democracy and you've always said it's a paper dragon militarily oh my yeah
[02:26:24.240 --> 02:26:30.080]  yeah military outgoing they china cannot attack us like japan did or germany they they they they
[02:26:30.080 --> 02:26:36.160]  just can't but they could cause problems in their sphere and there are growing tensions between china
[02:26:36.160 --> 02:26:40.080]  and japan there's growing tensions everywhere and that's one of the reasons a lot of these
[02:26:40.080 --> 02:26:45.200]  stock market guys say oh the stock market's not as overvalued as it was in 2000 when it crashed
[02:26:45.200 --> 02:26:50.160]  well the world is three times more risky than it was in 2000 there was no risk in the world
[02:26:50.160 --> 02:26:57.360]  nothing gone wrong for 18 years so so they're they're underestimating the risk and and and
[02:26:57.360 --> 02:27:01.200]  overestimating the value of stocks so so this is going to be again this is going to be a stock
[02:27:01.200 --> 02:27:07.440]  market crash around the world more important real estate around the world and when china goes
[02:27:07.440 --> 02:27:11.520]  especially in real estate that's going to be that's when people are going to get oh my gosh
[02:27:11.520 --> 02:27:17.520]  even vancouver can't hold up you know even london even new york so what about a chicago going under
[02:27:17.520 --> 02:27:22.480]  or portorico like you mentioned or california i mean everybody shakes their finger at greece
[02:27:22.480 --> 02:27:28.000]  aren't we if you count local debt and all the rest of it and even more debt than than greece
[02:27:28.000 --> 02:27:34.080]  well we have more private debt than greece you know compared to our economy greece has the most
[02:27:34.080 --> 02:27:39.760]  public debt outside of japan and ireland but but i'm telling you alex you look around the world
[02:27:39.760 --> 02:27:46.480]  most countries have close to four times gdp in private and public debt and then they have another
[02:27:46.480 --> 02:27:52.560]  double that up to eight times the united states and unfunded liabilities for social security medicare
[02:27:52.560 --> 02:27:57.680]  obama said raising the debt limit doesn't raise the debt are you saying he's a liar well i'm just
[02:27:57.680 --> 02:28:04.560]  saying we're going to run deficits forever because we've made commitments to the bay aging baby boom
[02:28:04.560 --> 02:28:09.520]  generation that will not be possible to be paid out of present sure i was being sarcastic about
[02:28:09.520 --> 02:28:14.720]  the obama thing but but what about what about young people refusing to do this for the baby boomers
[02:28:14.720 --> 02:28:21.520]  isn't that going to create a whole new split yeah i i think basically young people that start
[02:28:21.520 --> 02:28:25.600]  are going to start to say we got to start shooting old people and i you know i had to put it that way
[02:28:25.600 --> 02:28:31.120]  but there's no way they can pay for the baby boom benefit especially in an economy that's going to
[02:28:31.120 --> 02:28:37.840]  be very slow because of this debt deleveraging but also our demographics our workforce is going to
[02:28:37.840 --> 02:28:43.200]  grow a half a percent the rest of decade even if the economy stays good and then it's going to grow
[02:28:43.200 --> 02:28:47.680]  zero for the next decade after that and then it's going to grow slowly again we're just not going to
[02:28:47.680 --> 02:28:52.640]  see the type of growth that can pay off these entitlements so we're going to run deficits
[02:28:52.640 --> 02:28:58.480]  forever and at some point in the depths of a crisis we will have to say you know what we
[02:28:58.480 --> 02:29:05.200]  got to retire at 72 to 75 instead of 62 to 65 the greeks are retiring at 55 for crying out loud
[02:29:05.760 --> 02:29:11.280]  people want to die and go to heaven you know and that doesn't work in the economy we're going to
[02:29:11.280 --> 02:29:16.320]  go to bright come back and take some phone calls what else as a trigger just briefly the 30 seconds
[02:29:16.320 --> 02:29:22.400]  we have what other triggers are out there well again debt ratios are high everywhere once the
[02:29:22.400 --> 02:29:29.120]  economy gets worse all these debts get triggered and and and people say oh the banks look solving
[02:29:29.120 --> 02:29:32.560]  now they won't look solving if real estate goes down another 40 percent they're going to be in
[02:29:32.560 --> 02:29:38.880]  deeper trouble than they were in 2008 to 2012 i think the real estate decline around the world
[02:29:38.880 --> 02:29:43.280]  and i see a bigger decline just like stock it's the big trigger okay real estate that hits the
[02:29:43.280 --> 02:29:48.240]  stock by mortgage stay there and we're going to go over all the triggers you have a chart on that
[02:29:48.240 --> 02:29:54.960]  we're on the march the empire's on the run all's coming up alex jones and the gcn radio network
[02:29:58.880 --> 02:30:05.600]  when speaking about isis president obama recently said this ideologies are not defeated with guns
[02:30:05.600 --> 02:30:10.880]  they're defeated by better ideas the president was meeting with military leaders at the pentagon
[02:30:10.880 --> 02:30:15.840]  when he made the comments perhaps obama should have considered this notion before continuing the
[02:30:15.840 --> 02:30:22.640]  policy of flooding the chaotic middle east with weapons as info wars has tirelessly documented
[02:30:22.640 --> 02:30:28.560]  us weapons have fallen into isis hands time and time again and bolster the terror group
[02:30:28.560 --> 02:30:35.520]  via the insane policy of arming and training the so-called moderate rebels in libya syria and iraq
[02:30:35.520 --> 02:30:42.640]  the cia has shipped weapons to al-qaeda affiliated groups in syria since at least 2012 a fact reported
[02:30:42.640 --> 02:30:48.560]  by the new york times iraqi intelligence even claims that the us is intentionally dropping
[02:30:48.560 --> 02:30:54.320]  weapons to known isis-linked groups of rebels where were the better ideas when it mattered

[02:33:22.160 --> 02:33:27.920]  estimating global derivatives they have articles i've read in us today years ago you know saying
[02:33:27.920 --> 02:33:33.360]  that basically 60 of that we've signed on to we're talking about over a thousand trillion
[02:33:33.360 --> 02:33:39.200]  that's not my debt our real debts like 19 trillion if you look out at what we supposedly
[02:33:39.200 --> 02:33:43.760]  have signed on to it's more like a hundred plus trillion whatever it's all untenable
[02:33:44.880 --> 02:33:50.640]  and then i see the socialist generation the bernie sanders supporters running around i mean i

[02:33:56.480 --> 02:34:04.880]  i want that free they just don't get it the free lunch is about to be over and the problem is the
[02:34:04.880 --> 02:34:09.440]  corporate free lunch isn't most corporations are good most companies are good but the big
[02:34:09.440 --> 02:34:14.560]  top ones are a bunch of crony insiders they've gotten away with everything you can imagine
[02:34:14.560 --> 02:34:19.760]  they're the ones that count on totalitarianism to keep their butts out of jail they think they
[02:34:19.760 --> 02:34:24.640]  can just buy off governments and that long term they'll be safe they would have been safe not
[02:34:24.640 --> 02:34:29.760]  robbing the economy and just skimming off the top in a legitimate way because i'm all for wealth
[02:34:29.760 --> 02:34:37.520]  creation and wealth but but you have crony capitalist scapegoating real capitalism and i
[02:34:37.520 --> 02:34:42.960]  see that as the problem i see the big trigger is that once we go into just a recessionary depression
[02:34:43.920 --> 02:34:49.280]  that is a recession for some depression for others that the spoiled brats out there are
[02:34:49.280 --> 02:34:54.000]  going to use the crisis to have a political move to take over the government even more
[02:34:54.000 --> 02:34:59.760]  and nationalize and redistribute like venezuela did and then they'll really destroy the economy
[02:34:59.760 --> 02:35:04.080]  because we can always rebuild the economy quickly if we have free market if we don't
[02:35:05.280 --> 02:35:09.680]  we're living like the new soviet union i want to go to some phone calls for our guest
[02:35:10.640 --> 02:35:16.080]  harry dent of harry dent dot com again who predicted that the next big trigger would be
[02:35:16.080 --> 02:35:20.320]  china he was just here two weeks ago saying he was here a year ago saying it five years ago
[02:35:20.320 --> 02:35:25.520]  saying it it's now happening uh the media is being very calm about this but even british
[02:35:25.520 --> 02:35:30.000]  papers say could be a new you know global depression uh the chinese are pulling all their
[02:35:30.000 --> 02:35:35.200]  money out of the banks there's not enough greece is doing it our banks are making moves saying we
[02:35:35.200 --> 02:35:41.360]  won't give you cash soon uh so i see a lot of regulations being changed a lot of preparation
[02:35:41.920 --> 02:35:48.400]  for what i call batting down the hatches going over your demographic cliff going over the
[02:35:48.400 --> 02:35:52.800]  different triggers on the graph you put out a few years ago i see a few of those things
[02:35:52.800 --> 02:36:00.160]  have now happened but what about my rant my concern about the social risk a response we're
[02:36:00.160 --> 02:36:06.320]  going to see and all the race war mongering going on by the socialist who want to see a civil war
[02:36:06.320 --> 02:36:12.560]  in this country because they're dreaming of 1917 russia i mean i'm not being sarcastic we've got
[02:36:12.560 --> 02:36:20.400]  some really kooky bizarre sick people who openly say they want to cloward and piven collapse
[02:36:20.400 --> 02:36:24.720]  because then they can have their socialist takeover with hillary clinton or bernie sanders
[02:36:26.640 --> 02:36:32.160]  well you know i mean i've never seen more polarization uh it's as much from the rich to
[02:36:32.160 --> 02:36:37.360]  the everyday person as it was at the top of the roaring 20s but the political polarization
[02:36:37.360 --> 02:36:43.120]  is extreme especially in the united states i expect there to be a certain amount of civil
[02:36:43.120 --> 02:36:49.520]  unrest when you see higher unemployment you always see higher crime in a place like china when they
[02:36:49.520 --> 02:36:55.760]  move hundreds of millions of people in a little over a decade into cities with no skills and
[02:36:55.760 --> 02:37:00.800]  they're not even legal citizens of those cities when this machine of overbuilding everything to
[02:37:00.800 --> 02:37:06.080]  keep the economy going by a top-down government happens these people are going to be trapped and
[02:37:06.080 --> 02:37:10.000]  and they're going to have nowhere to go except the squad and the empty condos will be their only
[02:37:10.000 --> 02:37:16.880]  thing so i'd say you know like the the united states and china are two places i see is the most
[02:37:16.880 --> 02:37:25.600]  right or some some you know level of social unrest and where you live is important i've sold all my
[02:37:25.600 --> 02:37:31.440]  real estate in recent years because we saw the real estate thing coming um i kept one property
[02:37:31.440 --> 02:37:37.760]  on an island because i want some place to go if things get really bad and that's what the elites
[02:37:37.760 --> 02:37:42.160]  doing and we talked about a years ago but now it's in the guardian it's in the new york times uh
[02:37:42.160 --> 02:37:49.840]  their billionaires are building secret airstrips with armored redouts and basically hiring uh long
[02:37:49.840 --> 02:37:55.840]  term security teams and giving them uh you know stock accounts to basically you know never leave
[02:37:55.840 --> 02:38:02.800]  them um i guess annuities i mean wow when you see that type of behavior it makes you ask how bad will
[02:38:02.800 --> 02:38:08.480]  it get well and again the other thing we show about china is the wealthiest people in the last
[02:38:08.480 --> 02:38:12.640]  several years that have been leaving in droves what they do is they say oh we're just getting our
[02:38:12.640 --> 02:38:18.560]  kid an education in in california or new york or london or sydney australia and a good university
[02:38:18.560 --> 02:38:23.760]  oh and while we're there we're going to buy a 20 million dollar house what they're doing is laundering
[02:38:23.760 --> 02:38:30.400]  their money out of the country the rich chinese see this crash in china coming they see the overbuilding
[02:38:30.400 --> 02:38:35.840]  they don't trust the government it's not elected and that like you say is crony capitalism they're
[02:38:35.840 --> 02:38:41.680]  getting out that is not a good song well i talked to a big defense contractor owner five years ago
[02:38:41.680 --> 02:38:46.800]  and they said within five to six years the quote the us as you know it won't be there and then i
[02:38:46.800 --> 02:38:53.280]  ran into in outside of austin john wane's son and i didn't even know who it was when i was first talking
[02:38:53.280 --> 02:38:59.360]  to him and because my kids were camping out and at a ranch next door at a house of some doctors i know
[02:38:59.360 --> 02:39:03.520]  and then i was talking to and they're like yeah we're leaving to costa rica uh you won't get your
[02:39:03.520 --> 02:39:08.080]  money out in about a year and then there's going to be a collapse in the next six seven years and
[02:39:08.080 --> 02:39:13.360]  all the big money's leaving and and of course i talked about at the time but it's just it's like
[02:39:14.320 --> 02:39:19.360]  then the public acts like i'm trying to fear monger all i'm doing is telling people what's
[02:39:19.360 --> 02:39:25.600]  really going on and i wish it wasn't true yeah i mean same thing i was the most bullish economist
[02:39:25.600 --> 02:39:31.280]  from the late eighties on i'm not i'm not a a fear monger by nature but when you see a bubble of this
[02:39:31.280 --> 02:39:36.320]  magnitude and you see it's so global and then on top of that you see governments and this is
[02:39:36.320 --> 02:39:41.200]  unprecedented saying when when the bubble starts to unravel we're just not going to accept it we're
[02:39:41.200 --> 02:39:46.640]  just going to print trillions and trillions of dollars prop up markets artificially this is like
[02:39:46.640 --> 02:39:51.920]  fighting with sasquatch you don't do it you don't fight with mother nature it's bigger than you the
[02:39:51.920 --> 02:39:57.600]  universe is going to have a big response to this the free markets are and the good thing is you kind
[02:39:57.600 --> 02:40:02.240]  of hinted at earlier the good thing about free markets it can be painful when we make adjustments
[02:40:02.240 --> 02:40:07.200]  they make them quickly it's like you ate some bad sushi and your body's smart enough to just flush
[02:40:07.200 --> 02:40:12.960]  it out before it poisons you we're not smart enough to do that so so i do i do tell people i'm
[02:40:12.960 --> 02:40:17.680]  leaning more towards hey be more cautious than not not only be out of markets but what's the
[02:40:17.680 --> 02:40:23.360]  safest kind of best place for you to live and be how do you protect yourself in case things get
[02:40:23.360 --> 02:40:27.280]  really bad i don't know that they will because we're in a different era than in the thirties but
[02:40:27.280 --> 02:40:32.720]  they might and they could get really bad because this has just been extreme and i've never seen
[02:40:33.520 --> 02:40:41.200]  this much um irresponsibility in financial and fiscal management never any time in history
[02:40:41.200 --> 02:40:47.760]  well info wars.com is here covering it and we've been accurate our guests have been accurate you've
[02:40:47.760 --> 02:40:53.200]  been extremely accurate and then i look at the very central banks the very crony capitalists
[02:40:53.200 --> 02:40:59.040]  that have helped all this happen and they are going to be set to get more bailouts more power out
[02:40:59.040 --> 02:41:04.400]  of this i wonder my last question before we go to calls for you mr den is do you think the
[02:41:04.400 --> 02:41:10.160]  establishment crony capitalist will get out of this without getting in trouble uh the next round i
[02:41:10.160 --> 02:41:17.200]  mean are they really too big to fail um i think some of them will but but i think that the central
[02:41:17.200 --> 02:41:22.800]  banks are going to lose massive credibility they've done the stupidest thing in history it's worked
[02:41:22.800 --> 02:41:27.920]  for five or six years again you want to feel better take a drug you know there's tons of drugs you
[02:41:27.920 --> 02:41:32.800]  can take it never works out well that's what they've done financially this is going to end badly
[02:41:32.800 --> 02:41:37.440]  and they're going to lose credibility some of the crony capitalists are going to go down with them
[02:41:37.440 --> 02:41:42.960]  other ones are going to are big enough i mean the thing about a time like the 1930s is the strongest
[02:41:42.960 --> 02:41:49.440]  survive that the the dominant market share companies survive but i tell you lobbying is
[02:41:49.440 --> 02:41:54.480]  going to take a big hit my number one recommendation my book say what should governments do in the
[02:41:54.480 --> 02:42:00.800]  future no lobbyists you don't have it at all you don't let companies with special interests
[02:42:00.800 --> 02:42:04.560]  tell you what you should do in economic policies because they're going to tell you what's good for
[02:42:04.560 --> 02:42:09.760]  them and not what good for for you or the country yeah that's america and the whole world's biggest
[02:42:09.760 --> 02:42:13.600]  problem that's why third world countries are third world countries it's that they have special
[02:42:13.600 --> 02:42:19.680]  interest that destroy basic level playing field for their interest and then end up destroying the
[02:42:19.680 --> 02:42:27.680]  entire system long term i mean i mean it's a suicidal perspective yeah we look at demographics
[02:42:27.680 --> 02:42:32.720]  around the world when we see countries are still poor because of with good demographics we know
[02:42:32.720 --> 02:42:40.560]  there's corruption we know there's crony capitalism it's kind of tribal tribal economics which is not
[02:42:40.560 --> 02:42:45.840]  good and that's what america is going into is all these tribal groups and subgroups and it's
[02:42:45.840 --> 02:42:51.840]  being done by design by the ruling establishment who are just playing with fire brandon and texas
[02:42:51.840 --> 02:42:59.040]  thanks for holding you're on the air with mr den how you doing today good brother i guess um i have
[02:42:59.040 --> 02:43:05.600]  three questions if you guys have the time uh my first question is china who who owns majority of their
[02:43:05.600 --> 02:43:13.680]  debt mr dad oh well i mean their debt is just like all right the government has a certain amount
[02:43:13.680 --> 02:43:20.960]  they they push more of their debt down into the local communist parties and and they make it easy
[02:43:20.960 --> 02:43:26.320]  for them to borrow money so it's the local governments that that that owe the most debt
[02:43:26.320 --> 02:43:31.920]  they also have very low interest rates forced by the government on savers so savers over there put
[02:43:31.920 --> 02:43:38.960]  money in in um funds with brokerage firms that then make silly loans to real estate and they may you
[02:43:38.960 --> 02:43:44.320]  know so those loans are going to go bad so so part of its public part of its private but in china
[02:43:44.320 --> 02:43:51.040]  the the debt is more government driven than it is united states it's a top of our bubble boom
[02:43:51.040 --> 02:43:58.480]  uh only about 20 percent of the total debt in this country was government 80 percent was private
[02:43:58.480 --> 02:44:06.640]  and in china it's probably more 50 50 all right other questions brandon uh yes sir um now once we
[02:44:06.640 --> 02:44:12.080]  hit this economic collapse pretty much what how would that affect the homeowner that's still paying
[02:44:12.080 --> 02:44:19.120]  on a mortgage um well there's a bad and good there um if you've got a really high mortgage
[02:44:19.120 --> 02:44:25.280]  against uh falling equity i would almost say just hang on to it because at some point i think
[02:44:25.280 --> 02:44:29.440]  governments are going to be forced into telling the banks what they should have told them in the
[02:44:29.440 --> 02:44:35.920]  first place mark down your mortgage loans and your loans to market value by pumping all this money
[02:44:35.920 --> 02:44:41.760]  into the banks they they have not had to do that if you've got a house with higher equity
[02:44:41.760 --> 02:44:46.480]  i a real estate i i've been saying sell it unless it's like my little getaway place
[02:44:46.480 --> 02:44:52.240]  sell it because you can turn that into cash now and when you get this great deflation and this
[02:44:52.240 --> 02:44:57.920]  going to be deflation the leveraging of debt and financial assets you're going to be able to buy
[02:44:57.920 --> 02:45:06.480]  houses beachfront real estate companies all types of stuff at 20 cents on the dollar 10 20 30 cents
[02:45:06.480 --> 02:45:11.360]  it's going to be the the buying opportunity of a lifetime but you got to have cash because nobody
[02:45:11.360 --> 02:45:17.600]  stays like what is uh harry dent dot com recommendation okay brandon thank you good
[02:45:17.600 --> 02:45:25.360]  questions jerald in california you're on the air hey how's it going guys um look up to both you
[02:45:25.360 --> 02:45:32.400]  guys um so make this quick uh the financial crisis that's coming that has to do with this fiat
[02:45:32.400 --> 02:45:40.480]  currency uh system do you guys think this is a strategic plan to win us into the split endo
[02:45:40.480 --> 02:45:45.520]  or any you know kind of takeovers by the un on the or you know introducing us into a new
[02:45:45.520 --> 02:45:50.640]  financial system but obviously getting fight back from the people general that's a great
[02:45:51.440 --> 02:45:55.840]  i would ask the question this way obviously the the different establishments that work together
[02:45:55.840 --> 02:46:00.800]  at the g20 and stuff they have exit strategies out of this to always get more power out of the
[02:46:00.800 --> 02:46:07.040]  crises they helped incubate uh what do you think will come out of this ultimately um right now it
[02:46:07.040 --> 02:46:13.600]  looks like governments are turning to tyranny well yeah you see both of that you're going to see
[02:46:13.600 --> 02:46:18.320]  i think you're going to see power decentralized europe is going to break down into smaller units
[02:46:18.320 --> 02:46:24.480]  again i mean happen to some degree in the united states uh on the other hand there's always some
[02:46:24.480 --> 02:46:29.760]  people some entities government-wise and major corporations that because everything else is
[02:46:29.760 --> 02:46:34.560]  falling they get stronger and if they do have the cash from the power they will do that so you're
[02:46:34.560 --> 02:46:40.240]  going to see some of both but i i actually see more decentralization i don't think the united
[02:46:40.240 --> 02:46:45.040]  states is going to be as powerful militarily as it was in the past that's already happening
[02:46:45.600 --> 02:46:50.400]  and so it's going to be kind of a funny world where you don't you know where where governments
[02:46:50.400 --> 02:46:56.960]  fail i mean when these major central banks do this 14 trillion dollars of global stimulus
[02:46:56.960 --> 02:47:01.840]  and everything else and then the economy gets worse who's going to have faith in these people
[02:47:01.840 --> 02:47:06.400]  and and there's going to be major reforms to the banking system and they're not going to allow the
[02:47:06.400 --> 02:47:12.000]  bank that's what ron paul says he says we can come in and and and restore a ton of basic common
[02:47:12.000 --> 02:47:16.720]  sense and free market ideas but the danger is the socialists and all their idiot followers
[02:47:16.720 --> 02:47:21.360]  are going to try to take over during the crisis yeah and then they'll be both of that they'll be
[02:47:21.360 --> 02:47:26.320]  we will we will own people only do the right thing in a crisis when the barn's burning down
[02:47:26.320 --> 02:47:31.600]  people run in save the horse the dog and the baby and run out every day people become heroes
[02:47:31.600 --> 02:47:37.040]  just like in 9 11 but most of time people are too scared to do something when we get reality
[02:47:37.040 --> 02:47:41.280]  there's going to be some really good reforms come out of it but there's going to be some
[02:47:41.280 --> 02:47:45.280]  really bad people try to take over power in ways it can because a crisis
[02:47:45.840 --> 02:47:52.320]  does allow the strong to uh take advantage of look out for men on white horses or women
[02:47:53.680 --> 02:47:58.400]  women that ran Benghazi uh gerald great question let's talk to truth in ida you're on the air with
[02:47:58.400 --> 02:48:04.880]  mr dent hello Alex how are you today i'm doing all right thanks for holding i just crazy times i

[02:48:20.720 --> 02:48:23.200]  us we're going to skip this network break so we have a little bit more time i'll do a little
[02:48:23.200 --> 02:48:27.680]  bit of overdrive and have to go to you but we're we were taking calls on greece the global meltdown
[02:48:27.680 --> 02:48:32.000]  china that's the big issue we're covering and we'll be like that throughout the week obviously and
[02:48:32.000 --> 02:48:38.240]  expect to see more shoes drop notice uh more and more is happening i mean kind of this quickening
[02:48:38.240 --> 02:48:42.400]  that you and others have talked about uh so more and more of the triggers getting pulled in fact
[02:48:42.400 --> 02:48:46.560]  i want to see if we can put back on screen for tv viewers uh your chart we've been talking about
[02:48:46.560 --> 02:48:53.280]  this chart for a while how long is your has this global trigger chart been out there oh the last
[02:48:53.280 --> 02:48:59.680]  couple years i mean it's the same thing um the biggest surprise outside of the china bubble
[02:48:59.680 --> 02:49:04.880]  bursting we've been saying for last years is germany looks worse than japan did to us in the
[02:49:04.880 --> 02:49:08.880]  late eighties and we were the only people that saw the fall in japan the only people anywhere
[02:49:08.880 --> 02:49:13.280]  because they were just rising they look good but they were at a demographic peak they had a major
[02:49:13.280 --> 02:49:18.960]  real estate bubble and stock bubble just like china does the day and they went down like a lead balloon
[02:49:18.960 --> 02:49:24.880]  when the demographics no longer supported germany has the worst demographics in the next eight years
[02:49:24.880 --> 02:49:30.080]  and only the fall in the euro in the last few years has kept their exports up because they export
[02:49:30.080 --> 02:49:36.640]  50 percent of their i mean they should be making babies not uh mercedes-benz carl in texas you're
[02:49:36.640 --> 02:49:42.800]  on the air go ahead hey thanks gentlemen i just want to let you know i bought harry's book demographic
[02:49:42.800 --> 02:49:48.640]  cliff the last time you had him on which is a couple weeks ago and i appreciate that um another
[02:49:48.640 --> 02:49:55.360]  book that i downloaded for free it's a real short easy read and it lays this crisis at the feet of
[02:49:55.360 --> 02:50:03.040]  the same people that have been doing it since 1907 and that's a central bankers uh it's it's um
[02:50:03.040 --> 02:50:08.480]  it's uh none dare call it conspiracy like i said i downloaded it for gary allen we saw the book
[02:50:09.200 --> 02:50:16.320]  yeah and uh if you if you fancy yourself a populist the uh these guys the central bankers
[02:50:16.320 --> 02:50:21.520]  recognize the populist movement after they created the central bank or federal reserve
[02:50:21.520 --> 02:50:27.360]  as a threat and and the author uh recognized the populist movement as having all you know
[02:50:27.360 --> 02:50:31.760]  some good questions but all the wrong answers because a pop populist movement identified the
[02:50:31.760 --> 02:50:36.400]  central bankers as being a free enterprise whether or not they're all socialist so they took that
[02:50:36.400 --> 02:50:44.320]  movement over and that's what we have today um it's true that the super super rich elites
[02:50:44.320 --> 02:50:50.880]  are the ones funding the taking our guns breaking down our families uh getting us in debt i mean
[02:50:50.880 --> 02:50:57.360]  they're very parasitic and they wage war against real free market while getting the free market
[02:50:57.360 --> 02:51:03.200]  blamed so it's really a genius plan the george soros is of the world i appreciate your call um
[02:51:04.000 --> 02:51:09.120]  mr dent your take on what he was just saying yeah i mean i always tell people is no accident
[02:51:09.120 --> 02:51:15.200]  that the great depression and the roaring 20 bubble followed the creation of the federal reserve
[02:51:15.200 --> 02:51:19.600]  because they do the same thing they do they they go top down they don't let the economy
[02:51:19.600 --> 02:51:24.480]  rebalance they kill free market capitalism and since the economy doesn't rebalance you build
[02:51:24.480 --> 02:51:28.880]  bigger and bigger bubbles until you have a giant burst and that's what we have now in space
[02:51:29.520 --> 02:51:36.000]  central banks should only be there for liquidity and emergency situations they should not be
[02:51:36.000 --> 02:51:41.440]  constantly stimulating the economy they're they're basically like drug pushers i hate to say it but
[02:51:41.440 --> 02:51:47.840]  since the 70s when canesian economics became popular was invented in the 30s by john maner king
[02:51:47.840 --> 02:51:52.800]  basically we've been doing nothing but borrowing running trade deficits budget deficits creating
[02:51:52.800 --> 02:51:57.840]  a bigger and bigger bubble and histories clear on this bubbles always burst and when they do
[02:51:57.840 --> 02:52:02.640]  you see the worst of time that's right and at least before the central banks took over studying
[02:52:02.640 --> 02:52:07.760]  history there were a lot of bubbles but they were localized they were regionalized and sometimes
[02:52:07.760 --> 02:52:11.920]  they would build some infrastructure so when they popped the only folks getting burned were people
[02:52:11.920 --> 02:52:16.800]  that were burned at the end well that's free market but now since they prop them up they get so mega
[02:52:16.800 --> 02:52:21.360]  huge it engulfs people that weren't even part of them right and if you may and then and then the
[02:52:21.360 --> 02:52:26.480]  capitalist system the whole point is you make bad loans you lose money well they don't let anybody
[02:52:26.480 --> 02:52:31.200]  lose money anymore they don't let speculators lose money until it falls they only make us lose money
[02:52:31.200 --> 02:52:37.200]  bailing them out and that's a crime harry dot com we really did it when the economy collapsed
[02:52:38.560 --> 02:52:43.920]  now well one thanks for sure we're in for a wild ride this is just the beginning into the slide
[02:52:43.920 --> 02:52:49.360]  in my view and i think harry densview as well obviously walt in michigan thanks for holding
[02:52:49.360 --> 02:52:56.560]  you're on the air with our guest hello alex i want to point out uh revelation chapter 13 15
[02:52:56.560 --> 02:53:01.760]  through 18 that's what's going to happen to everybody around the world small and great rich
[02:53:01.760 --> 02:53:07.760]  and poor free and bond to receive a mark in their right hand or in their forehead you know the r5d
[02:53:07.760 --> 02:53:14.160]  chip it won't be able to fire sell that's your money and revelation 615 through 616 talks about
[02:53:14.160 --> 02:53:18.240]  what's going to have these rich men who've got all these caves and dens in the earth where they got
[02:53:18.240 --> 02:53:23.840]  all their food and all their goodies stored for them to get away from the lord jesus christ
[02:53:23.840 --> 02:53:29.680]  when he comes back to put a hammer on to this satanic new world order well walt i know this i
[02:53:29.680 --> 02:53:33.760]  am a christian uh i don't mean i fall these fake establishment churches that are basically
[02:53:33.760 --> 02:53:37.760]  government run but i'll tell you this this is biblical when they want to get rid of cash
[02:53:37.760 --> 02:53:43.200]  have a global superbank the popes endorsing it carbon taxes and where you've got to be
[02:53:43.200 --> 02:53:49.440]  tracked everything you do that sounds like a recipe that would absolutely be loved by any
[02:53:49.440 --> 02:53:56.480]  fascist leader your take on the whole move to demonize local farms local commerce barter
[02:53:57.280 --> 02:54:02.960]  you know micro economies lemonade stands this whole move towards getting rid of cash what's
[02:54:02.960 --> 02:54:10.400]  behind that well you know i mean this is natural to happen but when the when you get
[02:54:10.400 --> 02:54:15.040]  deleveraging and the economy breaks down that's the reason it breaks down you can't have real
[02:54:15.040 --> 02:54:20.880]  change in reform unless the present structures that have built up for decades all these special
[02:54:20.880 --> 02:54:26.880]  interests unless this breaks down you can't build out of the ashes again so so these these efforts
[02:54:26.880 --> 02:54:32.240]  like the chinese to prop up their stock market short term and and people to prop up systems and
[02:54:32.240 --> 02:54:36.480]  to keep printing money to keep the bubble from collapsing and financial institutions that over
[02:54:36.480 --> 02:54:42.720]  that money it's not going to work it just makes it worse in the long term so to me it's very simple
[02:54:42.720 --> 02:54:49.360]  the longer this denial bubble denial goes on the worse a crisis we'll have to follow sure and and
[02:54:49.360 --> 02:54:56.320]  the centralized uh state run economy or central bank run economy is in competition with any local
[02:54:56.320 --> 02:55:01.520]  economy it doesn't control and so everything's got to get in line and only buy from the central
[02:55:01.520 --> 02:55:07.760]  system in its view to prop it up when really all that does is destroy any true grassroots economy
[02:55:07.760 --> 02:55:14.080]  that's key during any collapse what we're not saying the worst thing china is the epitome like
[02:55:14.080 --> 02:55:20.320]  russia before so the union of a top-down government driven economy they say it's better they coordinate
[02:55:20.320 --> 02:55:26.800]  everything and people like it at first mark my words china is going to prove once and for all
[02:55:26.800 --> 02:55:33.040]  that a top-down centrally driven economy does not work as well as the bottoms up democratic
[02:55:33.040 --> 02:55:39.040]  free market system and democracy really alex is a bit of socialism it balances out capitalism and
[02:55:39.040 --> 02:55:44.480]  gets everybody a vote while the rich get richer if they add innovation but i'm telling you china
[02:55:44.480 --> 02:55:50.320]  is overexpanded 12 to 15 years in the future more than any country in history and they are going to
[02:55:50.320 --> 02:55:55.680]  go down they're going to fall over like an elephant well you're right the only true socialism is the
[02:55:55.680 --> 02:56:00.400]  free market in that it does give everybody a say but then the socialists actually attack it
[02:56:00.400 --> 02:56:05.120]  because they're not even real socialists and now you get deep into semantics and what it all means

[03:00:18.320 --> 03:00:24.960]  talking to the callers hb and femur region four on mortgages and housing markets sorry mr
[03:00:24.960 --> 03:00:31.920]  dent had to go but what's your take on this hey alex um a couple of things the fracking issue i
[03:00:31.920 --> 03:00:36.240]  don't want to i'm not taking joy in all those people losing their jobs but it's ruining our
[03:00:36.240 --> 03:00:42.000]  groundwater terribly we we don't need it we've got so much crude oil around we don't need fracking
[03:00:42.000 --> 03:00:45.760]  mortgages i'm going to i'm wondering what's going to happen to all of us mortgage holders when all
[03:00:45.760 --> 03:00:50.880]  this you know finally oh they're still packaging fraudulent loans you know they harass the person
[03:00:50.880 --> 03:00:56.320]  doing the borrowing at the grass level but then above it the big banks are still reselling them
[03:00:56.320 --> 03:01:00.560]  over and over again i mean what's going to happen to us guys where the rubber hits the road they
[03:01:00.560 --> 03:01:06.000]  gonna kick us out in a month or two aren't they you know if it gets bad enough if it gets bad enough
[03:01:06.000 --> 03:01:13.120]  they'll just reduce the rate they'll just reduce the the the payment and the overall bill the overall
[03:01:13.120 --> 03:01:17.840]  note that they come up with with a computer program that they think will keep you in the house paying
[03:01:17.840 --> 03:01:21.600]  the debt i mean i think dent's right that down the road they're gonna not just kick people out of
[03:01:21.600 --> 03:01:26.000]  their houses but then the globalist hate people so much they might just do that just to destabilize
[03:01:26.000 --> 03:01:31.200]  things i don't know i mean we're in the hands of people that are militarily conquering us
[03:01:31.200 --> 03:01:36.080]  through economic warfare what they'll do we're getting ready to put our house on the market
[03:01:36.080 --> 03:01:40.960]  i may be a little too late but and that one guy called in started on the religion thing i'm still
[03:01:40.960 --> 03:01:45.600]  of the mind that they're using the new testament the king james and those people rewrote it as a
[03:01:45.600 --> 03:01:50.400]  roadmap of what they're going to do to us i can't help but get over that well regardless they're
[03:01:50.400 --> 03:01:55.440]  following it so either the bible's true or the globalists are following it either way you know
[03:01:55.440 --> 03:02:00.320]  we science fiction a hundred years ago has become reality so humans are made in the image of god
[03:02:00.320 --> 03:02:05.360]  that are able to manifest what we envision and through the culture they're manifesting hell on
[03:02:05.360 --> 03:02:13.280]  earth so uh regardless strap yourselves in but good points hb i know this i'm going to oppose all
[03:02:13.280 --> 03:02:20.000]  this because it's in my bones to oppose it wherever the chips fall and i know god's real and i know
[03:02:20.000 --> 03:02:24.480]  god is not going to recognize me if i'm not fighting this but i don't even need to do that to try to
[03:02:24.480 --> 03:02:31.520]  get into heaven and all heaven is in my gut is not being with the spirit of evil you're with a good
[03:02:31.520 --> 03:02:40.960]  spirit god good creation love it's wonderful you're with bad people sounds like a claustrophobic
[03:02:40.960 --> 03:02:45.760]  nightmare to me and i'm ready to die whatever it takes i will never submit to this i will never
[03:02:45.760 --> 03:02:50.480]  go along with it um i just my soul already belongs to god and that's the end of it so
[03:02:50.480 --> 03:02:56.480]  um that's that's that's what it comes down to et uh phoning home from washington you're on the air
[03:02:56.480 --> 03:03:06.720]  go ahead yeah hey alex uh just two things uh the first is today in the year of our lord

[03:03:17.920 --> 03:03:25.520]  a bell um i know that hackers hinted at stock market turmoil hours before wall street shut down
[03:03:25.520 --> 03:03:32.720]  no alex alex nathan said his last words were i regret that i have but one life to give for my
[03:03:32.720 --> 03:03:41.040]  country and he was hung by the british oh yes yes yes now the second thing and the last
[03:03:41.040 --> 03:03:52.240]  is npog a n p o g that's a new paradigm of government it's if you type in to your favorite
[03:03:52.240 --> 03:04:00.160]  search engine you have two hits and the second one down is the one you want it's a new paradigm
[03:04:00.160 --> 03:04:08.960]  of government a n p o g in parentheses and the answer to all of the first the answer to all of
[03:04:08.960 --> 03:04:15.680]  our frustrations the answer which was given to us by our founders is there
[03:04:18.000 --> 03:04:22.080]  if you go to that website and read it carefully all right i'll check it out brother i'm out of
