[00:00:05.239 --> 00:00:06.559]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.559 --> 00:00:08.320]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:10.081]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.081 --> 00:00:11.661]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.661 --> 00:00:13.202]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.202 --> 00:00:17.403]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.403 --> 00:00:19.744]  And now, live from Austin, Texas...
[00:00:20.644 --> 00:00:22.045]  Alex Jones.
[00:00:22.045 --> 00:00:29.588]  Well, Emperor Palpatine's brother, I mean the Pope, is calling for world government two weeks ago, now a New World Order.
[00:00:29.588 --> 00:00:30.428]  But it doesn't exist.
[00:00:30.428 --> 00:00:36.550]  You're an extremist if you talk about it, because the ADL and Southern Poverty Law Center said so, and so did MSNBC.
[00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:40.452]  Just incredible meltdown in Europe, huge moves downward on the stock market.
[00:00:41.152 --> 00:00:42.653]  Huge transmission lined up.
[00:00:42.653 --> 00:00:47.395]  Investigative journalist Greg Pallas, an expert on Greece and the Euro, is going to be joining us.
[00:00:47.395 --> 00:00:48.656]  Open phones today.
[00:00:48.656 --> 00:00:57.540]  But first, a shocking report with video of the VA refusing veterans and saying they're not accepting people at the clinics.
[00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:00.942]  This is intensifying as the Don't Treat list expand.
[00:01:01.778 --> 00:01:07.564]  A Marine Corps veteran faces life in prison for cultivating marijuana plants while he lived in Oklahoma.
[00:01:07.564 --> 00:01:12.789]  Plants which he relied on to treat severe post-traumatic stress disorder.
[00:01:12.789 --> 00:01:24.461]  Last year, police raided the home of 33-year-old Christopher Lewandowski, a military father of three who was honorably discharged for medical reasons after serving multiple tours of duty in Iraq and Afghanistan.
[00:01:24.801 --> 00:01:35.863]  Christopher's wife, Whitney, reveals her husband, fearing liver damage from consuming a massive amount of pharmaceutical drugs, was successfully transitioning to marijuana as a preferred treatment.
[00:01:35.863 --> 00:01:37.904]  Whitney says, he was just using it.
[00:01:37.904 --> 00:01:40.784]  He couldn't get any, and of course we're a military family.
[00:01:40.784 --> 00:01:43.665]  We're very poor, we couldn't afford to buy it anyway.
[00:01:43.665 --> 00:01:45.925]  So he was just growing it for himself.
[00:01:45.925 --> 00:01:49.026]  He was on his way out of the military and just wanted to see if it would help.
[00:01:49.026 --> 00:01:52.607]  Police were summoned to Lewandowski's Geronimo residence in June 2014
[00:01:53.847 --> 00:01:57.529]  After neighbors reported him suffering a PTSD episode.
[00:01:57.529 --> 00:02:04.393]  Amid the emotional breakdown, Whitney brought their three children to the neighbor's house in an attempt to diffuse the situation.
[00:02:04.393 --> 00:02:13.879]  Rather than provide the former soldier immediate medical attention, police proceeded to conduct a search of Lewandowski's home for drugs locating six marijuana plants.
[00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:24.962]  Police charged Christopher with felony marijuana cultivation, possession of drug paraphernalia, and domestic violence, a charge which Whitney admits to have filed against her husband at the behest of the officers.
[00:02:24.962 --> 00:02:34.804]  The former felony charge carries a possible maximum fine of $25,000 and anywhere from 20 years to life in prison, according to Oklahoma statutes.
[00:02:34.804 --> 00:02:40.146]  Lewandowski's wife, Whitney, expressed the kind of help he got was being tossed in jail.
[00:02:40.146 --> 00:02:40.886]  Speaking of help,
[00:02:41.426 --> 00:02:45.109]  It should come as no surprise you won't find any at the VA.
[00:02:45.109 --> 00:02:50.792]  Post-traumatic stress sufferer, Iraq war veteran Chris Dorsey was told by a desk clerk at the U.S.
[00:02:50.792 --> 00:02:59.278]  Department of Veteran Affairs Clinic in Georgia that they aren't accepting any new patients.
[00:02:59.278 --> 00:02:59.578]  We're good.
[00:02:59.578 --> 00:03:00.419]  How about you, sir?
[00:03:00.419 --> 00:03:01.740]  Alright.
[00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:06.643]  I'd be doing a little better if I wasn't here, but... I have, uh...
[00:03:08.612 --> 00:03:11.075]  We're in the, uh, I was on Athens Clinic.
[00:03:11.075 --> 00:03:15.201]  I lost my job over there and I need to switch back over here.
[00:03:15.201 --> 00:03:18.165]  We're not accepting any new patients.
[00:03:18.165 --> 00:03:21.009]  The VA's not accepting any new patients?
[00:03:21.009 --> 00:03:22.331]  Not this clinic.
[00:03:22.331 --> 00:03:24.273]  Okay.
[00:03:24.273 --> 00:03:24.654]  Alright.
[00:03:24.654 --> 00:03:25.175]  Appreciate it.
[00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:39.668]  This was the second facility Dorsey had been turned away from in a matter of days for his post-traumatic stress, even though it was PTSD Awareness Month.
[00:03:39.668 --> 00:03:46.734]  Both of the facilities he visited failed to tell him of special treatment available to him as a part of PTSD Awareness Month.
[00:03:47.194 --> 00:03:48.515]  My name is Miguel Roberts.
[00:03:48.515 --> 00:03:51.157]  I'm a clinical psychologist with the DCVA.
[00:03:51.157 --> 00:03:55.540]  I'm the Director of Trauma Services in the PTSD Clinic.
[00:03:55.540 --> 00:04:03.586]  So PTSD Awareness Month was started in 2010 by an act of Congress that established June 27th as PTSD Awareness Day.
[00:04:03.586 --> 00:04:06.027]  And we think that that's important because
[00:04:07.148 --> 00:04:13.410]  To educate veterans about the signs and symptoms of PTSD, that help is available.
[00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:21.753]  Essentially, the VA, the creator of PTSD Awareness Month, was unaware of PTSD Awareness Month.
[00:04:21.753 --> 00:04:28.736]  Mr. Speaker, today I rise in recognition of the National Post Traumatic Stress Disorder Awareness Month.
[00:04:29.136 --> 00:04:42.292]  Nearly one-third of Iraq and Afghanistan veterans who receive VA health care in the decade after 2001 were diagnosed with PTSD and the numbers are only expected to climb unfortunately.
[00:04:42.292 --> 00:04:45.075]  As our tax dollars burn in the wind.
[00:04:45.075 --> 00:04:46.998]  John Bowne for InfoWars.com
[00:04:59.278 --> 00:05:02.519]  Do you have a bio-terror lab in your backyard?
[00:05:02.519 --> 00:05:04.540]  I'm not talking about freelance terrorists.
[00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:05.720]  I'm talking about U.S.
[00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:10.102]  government-sanctioned and subsidized biological weapon labs.
[00:05:10.102 --> 00:05:16.064]  A USA Today investigation revealed over 200 bio labs from New York City to a valley in Montana.
[00:05:16.064 --> 00:05:23.087]  And over 100 of those biosafety level 3 and level 4 labs, half of them, have had serious safety violations.
[00:05:23.487 --> 00:05:27.431]  This is far beyond the careless shipment of live anthrax by the U.S.
[00:05:27.431 --> 00:05:28.252]  military.
[00:05:28.252 --> 00:05:36.459]  These biolabs are weaponizing deadly bacteria, what the Pentagon calls select agents, making them more deadly and easier to catch.
[00:05:36.459 --> 00:05:38.281]  They call it gain of function.
[00:05:38.281 --> 00:05:44.287]  The House Oversight Committee is asking for details, and as one congressman says, we've been lucky, but that luck may run out.
[00:05:44.947 --> 00:05:49.155]  No, with the accident rate they've had, it's a mathematical certainty it will.
[00:05:49.155 --> 00:05:49.576]  The U.S.
[00:05:49.576 --> 00:05:55.506]  government bio-terror program is yet another dangerous and deadly federal program that shouldn't even exist.
[00:05:55.506 --> 00:05:57.950]  For InfoWars.com, I'm David Knight.
[00:05:59.062 --> 00:06:04.807]  Your liver can be full of fatty deposits, built-up toxins, and even dangerous objects known as liver stones.
[00:06:04.807 --> 00:06:19.260]  We worked with the top developers in the field of detox to take tried and true herbs and other compounds known to safely cleanse the liver and fuse it with the latest research and technological development on concentrating these ingredients to give you the maximum effect.
[00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:27.523]  Liver Shield is the only liver support product on the market that uses a patented Spigyrex blend of powerful organic herbs that support detoxification.
[00:06:27.523 --> 00:06:32.946]  And when you visit InfoWarsLife.com, see the instructional video on how to do a six-day liver detox.
[00:06:32.946 --> 00:06:36.647]  This isn't a game, and let me tell you, the results are dramatic.
[00:06:36.647 --> 00:06:40.789]  Liver Shield is totally organic and made of the safest, high-quality herbs.
[00:06:40.789 --> 00:06:44.651]  But that said, you need to consult your physician before you do the full detox.
[00:06:45.091 --> 00:06:49.216]  Liver Shield can also be used daily by itself for overall upkeep of the liver.

[00:06:57.285 --> 00:07:04.914]  Used since before the days of the Roman Empire to support the body's natural systems and enhance overall health.
[00:07:05.254 --> 00:07:09.857]  Introducing the new Infowarslife.com oil of oregano formulation.
[00:07:09.857 --> 00:07:17.803]  A highly advanced nutraceutical form of this key herb that has been traditionally used by civilizations for thousands of years to promote health.

[00:07:31.852 --> 00:07:32.532]  We're good.
[00:08:09.477 --> 00:08:13.591]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[00:08:13.591 --> 00:08:15.317]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:08:21.274 --> 00:08:46.387]  I went out walkin' Through streets paved with gold Lifted some stones Saw the skin and bones Of a city without a soul I went out walkin' Under an atomic sky Where the ground won't turn
[00:08:47.748 --> 00:08:53.253]  We're live, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:08:53.253 --> 00:08:58.277]  It's Wednesday, already the 8th day of July 2015.
[00:08:58.277 --> 00:09:10.448]  You notice we've been having guests on every day about the imminent global financial meltdown that appears to be a foregone conclusion.
[00:09:11.345 --> 00:09:19.009]  With most of the smart money on serious corrections by this fall or winter.
[00:09:19.009 --> 00:09:32.337]  And you've heard me come out just last week after two years of not promoting gold and saying that I believe you will see gold by the end of this year dramatically go upwards.
[00:09:32.337 --> 00:09:37.480]  And I don't normally make specific predictions, but I've got to go with my gut on this.
[00:09:37.480 --> 00:09:40.302]  I've got to go on the activities we've seen of the elites.
[00:09:41.647 --> 00:09:56.506]  Scurrying for cover, getting their money out of the West, running to armored redoubts, building secret airfields in remote areas of the Arctic and New Zealand, as well as the Ozarks here in the United States.
[00:09:58.277 --> 00:10:00.958]  I don't like being right about all this.
[00:10:00.958 --> 00:10:07.902]  I wish I was wrong about forced inoculations and driverless cars and the rise of the robots.
[00:10:07.902 --> 00:10:14.646]  The Pope has called for world government again today and called it a New World Order.
[00:10:15.623 --> 00:10:34.121]  They have to understand, ADL, Southern Poverty Law Center, MSNBC, Democratic Party, Republican talk show host have all said you're basically insane or a terrorist if you talk about it.
[00:10:34.121 --> 00:10:35.162]  That it doesn't exist.
[00:10:35.162 --> 00:10:38.645]  That's because they were building it in quasi-secret.
[00:10:38.645 --> 00:10:40.487]  The Pope wants a planetary government.
[00:10:41.274 --> 00:10:44.095]  Based on ecological economic order.
[00:10:44.095 --> 00:11:00.319]  That means socialism, communism for the general public, elites above the law, total surveillance of everything you do, to then pay taxes, VAT taxes, carbon taxes, you name it, as carbon indulgences to the world government.
[00:11:00.319 --> 00:11:08.101]  This is the new religion, fusing communism, collectivism with earth worship, run by a church.
[00:11:09.482 --> 00:11:23.353]  You talk about apostasy, you talk about devil, you talk about world government, you talk about antichrist, you talk about what you're beginning to see the beginning of.
[00:11:23.353 --> 00:11:29.959]  And even if you're an atheist, listen to me and listen carefully in a Carl Jung way.
[00:11:29.959 --> 00:11:37.245]  Whether there are spirits and influences and forces in other dimensions, which mathematics has proven exist, the dimensions,
[00:11:38.962 --> 00:11:53.849]  Regardless, humans on a mass scale, through group consciousness, that's not spiritual, it's a fact, it's been proven, through mass consciousness can manifest these archetypes of good and evil.
[00:11:53.849 --> 00:12:03.774]  And we know what's manifesting right now, it is 200 proof pure wickedness.
[00:12:03.774 --> 00:12:05.775]  Deception, fraud, inversion.
[00:12:08.047 --> 00:12:11.588]  Everything the globalists claim they're going to bring us, it's the opposite.
[00:12:11.588 --> 00:12:17.370]  Everything they say is a deception.
[00:12:17.370 --> 00:12:19.691]  Epic time right now.
[00:12:19.691 --> 00:12:20.672]  Now what am I getting at?
[00:12:20.672 --> 00:12:27.354]  Pope calls for world government again and having it based on wealth redistribution and fake environmentalism.
[00:12:29.329 --> 00:12:31.351]  What does Endgame, made eight years ago, break down?
[00:12:31.351 --> 00:12:32.612]  This exact plan.
[00:12:32.612 --> 00:12:34.734]  Why is it to the word exact?
[00:12:34.734 --> 00:12:38.517]  Because we're following their declassified and leaked statements.
[00:12:38.517 --> 00:12:40.759]  We have their exact playbook.
[00:12:40.759 --> 00:12:46.524]  Not just the playbook, but what plays they're going to play in what order.
[00:12:46.524 --> 00:12:57.553]  Unprecedented to sit here and watch this pure evil rise, and they are demonizing anyone that opposes it, still saying it doesn't exist, while they announce it.
[00:12:59.105 --> 00:13:07.371]  New York City Stock Exchange has suspended trading.
[00:13:07.371 --> 00:13:13.156]  Trillions of dollars have been lost in the Chinese stock market today.
[00:13:13.156 --> 00:13:18.120]  Stock markets around the world are rocked.
[00:13:18.120 --> 00:13:23.924]  Told you something big was coming and this is just the start, my gut tells me.
[00:13:23.924 --> 00:13:27.447]  NY Stock Exchange suspends trading.
[00:13:28.649 --> 00:13:35.722]  The really worrying financial crisis is happening in China, not Greece, as we've continued to say for the last year.
[00:13:35.722 --> 00:13:38.567]  In fact, we've got to get Mr. Dent on the broadcast.
[00:13:39.690 --> 00:13:47.471]  Because he's the one, when almost every other pundit said, no, China's doing great, he's the one saying China is the one that's going to blow.
[00:13:47.471 --> 00:13:51.252]  Its stock market is up 100% in just the last few years.
[00:13:51.252 --> 00:13:52.332]  It's a total fraud.
[00:13:52.332 --> 00:13:54.073]  They've got unrest everywhere.
[00:13:54.073 --> 00:14:03.234]  And when it blows, it's going to bring down the whole global economy, right as the baby boomers enter the second quadrant of retirement.
[00:14:03.234 --> 00:14:05.034]  Baby boomers from about 1947 through about
[00:14:08.945 --> 00:14:11.626]  Fifty-eight, depending on what you call a baby boomer.
[00:14:11.626 --> 00:14:12.987]  They're all retiring.
[00:14:12.987 --> 00:14:14.688]  The first third is retired.
[00:14:14.688 --> 00:14:16.709]  We're going into the second third.
[00:14:16.709 --> 00:14:18.449]  People born in 1950, 51, 52, 53, 54.
[00:14:18.449 --> 00:14:23.772]  And then the last group retires.
[00:14:23.772 --> 00:14:26.313]  Our population growth is negative.
[00:14:26.313 --> 00:14:30.715]  We're only bringing in unskilled, mainly welfare types now from all over the world.
[00:14:32.295 --> 00:14:33.636]  I mean, we have labor statistics.
[00:14:33.636 --> 00:14:36.077]  We know we're getting mainly unskilled people here.
[00:14:36.077 --> 00:14:45.663]  And then now the Democratic Party is there shoving a government milky their way, hoping that they then become Democratic Party voters.
[00:14:45.663 --> 00:14:49.945]  And the Republican Party basically has merged the Democrats, so they love it.
[00:14:49.945 --> 00:14:52.607]  I mean, we are burning down right now.
[00:14:53.868 --> 00:15:01.410]  Going totally bankrupt, and they're just shipping in as many unskilled people as they can to sink the boat completely, like Greece.
[00:15:01.410 --> 00:15:07.891]  So when we go belly up, like Africa has, they can come in and just take the whole thing over for nothing.
[00:15:07.891 --> 00:15:14.112]  Libya was helping all of Africa, funding real projects.
[00:15:14.112 --> 00:15:17.033]  Compared to the globalists, Muammar Gaddafi was basically a saint.
[00:15:17.033 --> 00:15:18.713]  I just have to tell the truth.
[00:15:18.713 --> 00:15:22.694]  They went in and took him out, folks, and now all Africa is going into the abyss.
[00:15:26.087 --> 00:15:30.332]  They blew up all the infrastructure, turned Al-Qaeda loose to run around murdering everybody.
[00:15:30.332 --> 00:15:38.701]  Now Al-Qaeda has spilled all the way into Central Africa, all the way into Western Africa, and is just running around murdering everyone.
[00:15:38.701 --> 00:15:40.883]  All run by Hillary Clinton!
[00:15:40.883 --> 00:15:43.546]  This morning, I got up about 6 a.m.
[00:15:43.546 --> 00:15:44.487]  and I was in the shower.
[00:15:44.487 --> 00:15:45.669]  That's when I tend to wake up.
[00:15:46.809 --> 00:16:05.660]  Made coffee, drank half a cup, got in the shower, turned on a hot shower, and I'm just standing there with suds in my hair, and I just put my head up against the wall, and I was like, this can't really be happening, that Hillary Clinton's probably going to be our next president, when she's such a criminal gangster, so evil, such a fraud, and armed al-Qaeda
[00:16:06.593 --> 00:16:09.875]  And ran the whole strategy to destabilize Africa and the Middle East.
[00:16:09.875 --> 00:16:14.859]  And then I got to hear about how she's a woman and I'm a bigot against women because I don't like her.
[00:16:14.859 --> 00:16:20.603]  I mean, what a triumph over reality political correctness has had.
[00:16:20.603 --> 00:16:32.291]  After eight years of black versus white under Obama, now it's going to be man versus woman and they're going to rub salt in the wound while the global economy melts into the ground.
[00:16:33.232 --> 00:16:36.915]  All we're going to hear about is how men don't like women.
[00:16:36.915 --> 00:16:41.958]  Dividing and conquering is seven ways to Sunday.
[00:16:41.958 --> 00:16:46.441]  Truly insane!
[00:16:46.441 --> 00:16:49.043]  The globalists live off chaos.
[00:16:49.043 --> 00:16:50.384]  They're vultures.
[00:16:50.384 --> 00:16:55.928]  Vulture crony capitalists who use socialism to domesticate and stun their quarry.
[00:16:57.267 --> 00:17:02.435]  New York City Stock Exchange suspends trading in all securities.
[00:17:02.435 --> 00:17:08.063]  The New York Stock Exchange halted trading in all securities as it addressed a computer malfunction.
[00:17:08.063 --> 00:17:12.309]  Yeah, that's what happened, a computer malfunction.
[00:17:13.190 --> 00:17:16.753]  The level of BS that is shoveled at us every day.
[00:17:16.753 --> 00:17:23.778]  I mean, we live in such an upside-down world that they have all these movie stars, everybody weighing in with this fake outrage.
[00:17:23.778 --> 00:17:30.543]  How dare Donald Trump say a bunch of criminals are coming in, running from justice in other countries?
[00:17:30.543 --> 00:17:33.646]  I mean, that's how they can invert reality.
[00:17:33.646 --> 00:17:35.868]  How dare Donald Trump say fish live in the water?
[00:17:38.186 --> 00:17:41.409]  We're currently experiencing a technical issue.
[00:17:41.409 --> 00:17:44.632]  What with the Matrix?
[00:17:44.632 --> 00:17:55.582]  We're currently experiencing a technical issue that we're working to resolve as quickly as possible, said the New York Stock Exchange spokeswoman, said in an email statement.
[00:17:55.582 --> 00:18:02.248]  We will be providing further updates as soon as we can and are doing our utmost to produce a swift resolution
[00:18:03.359 --> 00:18:05.540]  Communicate thoroughly and transparently.
[00:18:05.540 --> 00:18:07.460]  That's the opposite of that.
[00:18:07.460 --> 00:18:11.121]  That means communicate through pure deceptions and as hidden as possible.
[00:18:11.121 --> 00:18:12.361]  Let's decipher that.
[00:18:12.361 --> 00:18:20.244]  We will be providing further updates as soon as we can and are doing our utmost to produce a swift resolution.
[00:18:20.244 --> 00:18:26.525]  Communicate thoroughly and transparently and ensure a timely and orderly market reopen.
[00:18:26.525 --> 00:18:28.626]  Stock stop trading on the exchange platform.
[00:18:29.466 --> 00:18:42.965]  At about 11.32am New York time, about 40 minutes ago, 45 minutes ago, they continued to change hands on other venues such as the Nasdaq Stock Market and BATS Global Markets.
[00:18:42.965 --> 00:18:45.709]  The head of the Securities and Exchange Commission declined to comment.
[00:18:46.803 --> 00:19:00.266]  Yeah, they're probably too busy indicting someone that, you know, they claimed it insider trading for a couple hundred thousand dollars with no proof and then have a big grandstanding media event about it and throw them in prison like Martha Stewart or trying to put Mark Cuban in jail.
[00:19:00.266 --> 00:19:02.767]  They sent Mark Cuban emails and called him.
[00:19:02.767 --> 00:19:07.868]  I told you about it a year before it was in the news and said, you want to put out an Alex Jones movie?
[00:19:07.868 --> 00:19:10.069]  We're going to put you in jail.
[00:19:10.069 --> 00:19:12.329]  We're going to set you up.
[00:19:12.329 --> 00:19:14.330]  They even send emails and make phone calls.
[00:19:15.469 --> 00:19:18.750]  We're gonna set you up!
[00:19:18.750 --> 00:19:31.655]  But don't worry, the Securities and Exchange Commission, they're going to get to the bottom of it and they're helping work with the Democrats in Texas to indict our Attorney General.
[00:19:31.655 --> 00:19:34.616]  He didn't pay some filing fee or something.
[00:19:34.616 --> 00:19:38.398]  But meanwhile, the stock market had a glitch, it's turned off right now.
[00:19:38.398 --> 00:19:44.160]  It has nothing to do with the Chinese market going down 37% and losing tens of trillions of dollars.
[00:19:46.109 --> 00:19:53.016]  China looks like it's heading for the, it's version of the 29th stock market crash, says the London Telegraph.
[00:19:53.016 --> 00:19:54.017]  It's version?
[00:19:54.017 --> 00:19:55.279]  This is global!
[00:19:55.279 --> 00:19:57.141]  This will be world-wide!
[00:19:59.620 --> 00:20:05.864]  It's time to build your own emergency food stockpile with the industry leader, MyPatriotSupply.

[00:20:50.790 --> 00:20:51.190]  Don't wait.
[00:20:51.190 --> 00:20:51.871]  Call today.
[00:21:07.227 --> 00:21:15.393]  Because the companies I've been approached by were not the highest quality, and they weren't as affordable as they should be, so I refused.
[00:21:15.393 --> 00:21:18.475]  Probably 30, 40 firearms manufacturers over the years.
[00:21:18.475 --> 00:21:23.199]  Well, then, about six months ago, we get contacted by Head Down Firearms.
[00:21:23.199 --> 00:21:24.740]  Hdfirearms.com.
[00:21:24.740 --> 00:21:28.062]  Owned and run by a bunch of former Navy SEALs, special ops people.
[00:21:28.062 --> 00:21:32.866]  They're veterans, they're patriots, they're listeners of the radio show, and they want to support the broadcast.
[00:21:33.146 --> 00:21:37.029]  It's always about security, whether it's for yourself, your wife, your loved ones.
[00:21:37.029 --> 00:21:39.390]  Go to their website, HDFirearms.com.
[00:21:39.390 --> 00:21:43.813]  Buy right off their website, and they'll just send it to the FFL dealer of your choice.
[00:21:43.813 --> 00:21:47.116]  You can pick it up at the gun show, you can pick it up at a local sporting goods store.
[00:21:47.116 --> 00:21:51.479]  Whatever you do, get your Head Down firearm today.
[00:21:51.479 --> 00:21:56.102]  The spirit of 1776 lives at Head Down Firearms.
[00:21:56.102 --> 00:21:57.002]  HDFirearms.com.
[00:21:58.632 --> 00:22:00.414]  Honey, it's time for dinner.
[00:22:00.414 --> 00:22:02.275]  What are you doing over there on your computer?
[00:22:02.275 --> 00:22:03.776]  I'm shopping for a new wallet.
[00:22:03.776 --> 00:22:05.298]  Mine is falling apart.
[00:22:05.298 --> 00:22:11.483]  Hey, did you know there's a company called ID Stronghold that makes shielded wallets to prevent electronic pickpocketing?
[00:22:11.483 --> 00:22:14.705]  Oh, I didn't realize there was such a thing as electronic pickpocketing.
[00:22:14.705 --> 00:22:15.226]  What is that?
[00:22:15.546 --> 00:22:25.088]  Well, apparently many of the new credit and debit cards being issued have radio chips inside them called RFID to transmit our banking information to card readers when we pay.
[00:22:25.088 --> 00:22:33.790]  Unfortunately, a bad guy can also get one of these readers and go around the city scanning people, collecting their credit card numbers and personal information without us knowing it.
[00:22:33.790 --> 00:22:34.410]  Wow!
[00:22:34.410 --> 00:22:35.730]  That sounds scary!
[00:22:35.730 --> 00:22:40.191]  Since you're getting a new wallet anyway, you should definitely get an ID Stronghold shielded wallet.
[00:22:40.191 --> 00:22:41.011]  Are they more expensive?
[00:22:41.451 --> 00:22:41.972]  No.
[00:22:41.972 --> 00:22:49.658]  In fact, I can get a shielded leather wallet from idstronghold.com for the same price or less than regular unshielded wallets from other stores.
[00:22:49.658 --> 00:22:50.838]  Sounds great!
[00:22:50.838 --> 00:22:53.481]  My wallet isn't falling apart yet, but let me pick one out too.
[00:22:53.481 --> 00:22:57.544]  I want to be protected, and these wallets at idstronghold.com look fantastic!
[00:22:58.064 --> 00:22:59.005]  Hey, Berkey Guy here.
[00:22:59.005 --> 00:23:00.846]  Are you still drinking unfiltered tap water?
[00:23:00.846 --> 00:23:02.607]  Does your water contain chlorine or fluoride?
[00:23:02.607 --> 00:23:04.568]  Will you have drinkable water in an emergency?

[00:23:19.277 --> 00:23:22.539]  Join them by visiting GoBerkey.com or call me, the Berkey Guy, at 877-886-3653.
[00:23:22.539 --> 00:23:22.719]  That's 877-886-3653.

[00:23:55.895 --> 00:23:56.755]  Come and take it!
[00:24:07.216 --> 00:24:08.977]  We're here live, Monday through Friday.
[00:24:08.977 --> 00:24:09.998]  11 a.m.
[00:24:09.998 --> 00:24:10.298]  to 2 p.m.
[00:24:10.298 --> 00:24:10.798]  Central.
[00:24:10.798 --> 00:24:14.941]  Is the stock market crash gonna be any easier on ya?
[00:24:14.941 --> 00:24:17.423]  That you got the rebel flag to blame?
[00:24:27.526 --> 00:24:36.148]  I wonder if, uh, Jenner wearing a dress will save us.
[00:24:36.148 --> 00:24:40.890]  I wonder if banning brown paper bags will.
[00:24:40.890 --> 00:24:48.252]  I wonder if gag orders and arresting people in Oregon that criticize same-sex marriage, I wonder if that'll make us free.
[00:24:50.475 --> 00:25:01.920]  See, we've had our real rights replaced with faux rights to infight with each other all day, while the globalists prepare to orchestrate a worldwide stock market collapse.
[00:25:01.920 --> 00:25:15.745]  This may not be it, but they'll use this to get more regulatory powers, more consolidation, more bailouts ahead of the big one that is coming, part of the Trilateral Commission's plan since the year I was born.
[00:25:15.745 --> 00:25:17.306]  They launched the Trilateral Commission
[00:25:18.388 --> 00:25:27.627]  In 1974, the year before they publicly announced it, when Jimmy Carter began to prepare to run for president.
[00:25:32.658 --> 00:25:34.199]  41 years ago.
[00:25:34.199 --> 00:25:42.045]  And they said once they create the three global superstructures, they will then use those to suck dry and implode the nation states that were under it.
[00:25:42.045 --> 00:25:47.349]  They will then collapse that and out of it bring in a world government as the solution.
[00:25:47.349 --> 00:25:50.511]  And right on cue, world leaders call for planetary re-government.
[00:25:51.616 --> 00:26:05.007]  To fix the problem and 100 trillion in global taxes every decade to be paid to the UN, the IMF, the World Bank, and the International Bank of Settlements.
[00:26:05.007 --> 00:26:16.998]  And those three megabanks are all basically consortiums for the same six banks that you will pay taxes directly to, and they will take money out of your bank account whenever they want, no judge, no jury, no nothing.
[00:26:18.240 --> 00:26:31.669]  And they will devalue your currency when they want, and they will ban cash, and they will micromanage every facet of your life, and they will raise insurance until you can't afford to drive a car, and you, if you're lucky enough to even have the money to have a car, it'll be robot-driven.
[00:26:32.848 --> 00:26:37.932]  Already all the new cars stop when they think there's danger or call the police on you.
[00:26:37.932 --> 00:26:42.015]  They've already all have AI hooked in technology in them.
[00:26:42.015 --> 00:26:49.900]  Artificially intelligent, not conscious, but artificially intelligent and autonomous to run your life.
[00:26:49.900 --> 00:26:52.862]  It's already been rolled out.
[00:26:52.862 --> 00:27:00.548]  We're in the final phases and they're just going to flip on the switch and we're not going to be in happy land anymore.
[00:27:06.431 --> 00:27:30.988]  I live in Austin, Texas, the beautiful heart of this republic, now overrun by all the failures that couldn't make it in California and other states, here lecturing us on their ways of regulations and raiding people's funds and destroying society.
[00:27:34.028 --> 00:27:38.529]  And they're running around celebrating in the streets downtown.
[00:27:38.529 --> 00:27:39.109]  Donald Trump!
[00:27:39.109 --> 00:27:39.970]  Donald Trump!
[00:27:39.970 --> 00:27:41.510]  People walk up, haha, how do you like it?
[00:27:41.510 --> 00:27:42.990]  Donald Trump's been discredited.
[00:27:42.990 --> 00:27:45.191]  As if that even matters.
[00:27:45.191 --> 00:27:47.472]  It's all just the faux story.
[00:27:47.472 --> 00:27:48.672]  The rebel flag.
[00:27:48.672 --> 00:27:50.032]  The Donald Trump.
[00:27:50.032 --> 00:27:52.033]  The Caitlyn Jenner.
[00:27:52.033 --> 00:27:56.054]  Will he have his member removed?
[00:27:56.054 --> 00:27:59.415]  I mean, this is like a PCP hallucination.
[00:28:02.093 --> 00:28:02.693]  What do you think?
[00:28:02.693 --> 00:28:05.714]  Your boy, Trump's in trouble!
[00:28:05.714 --> 00:28:08.475]  And I go, Donald Trump's never been my boy.
[00:28:08.475 --> 00:28:09.895]  I think he's a ringer.
[00:28:09.895 --> 00:28:10.876]  Oh yeah, sure.
[00:28:10.876 --> 00:28:12.176]  You're losing right now.
[00:28:12.176 --> 00:28:14.977]  You're losing, you're losing, you're losing.
[00:28:14.977 --> 00:28:16.937]  I'm like, no, actually what he's saying is the truth.
[00:28:16.937 --> 00:28:19.758]  I mean, Mexico's collapsed in a total crime wave.
[00:28:19.758 --> 00:28:23.739]  I mean, are you denying the illegal alien crime wave?
[00:28:23.739 --> 00:28:25.600]  You people never get it.
[00:28:25.600 --> 00:28:26.820]  Your time's over!
[00:28:26.820 --> 00:28:27.720]  Your time's over!
[00:28:27.720 --> 00:28:29.421]  And you'll be looking at some liberal.
[00:28:30.424 --> 00:28:33.767]  With non-matching socks that they wear like they're God.
[00:28:33.767 --> 00:28:36.450]  I don't care if you're wearing non-matching socks.
[00:28:36.450 --> 00:28:38.112]  I don't care if you've got a handlebar mustache.
[00:28:38.112 --> 00:28:39.032]  I don't care.
[00:28:39.032 --> 00:28:42.936]  But the fact that you have it, you think you've now attained Godhood.
[00:28:42.936 --> 00:28:46.139]  That you're so ignorant, you don't know what July 4th is.
[00:28:46.880 --> 00:29:09.876]  But you're running around celebrating, we're the Democrats, we're winning, Donald Trump's in trouble, while the global stock market's melting down, while they put cancer viruses in the vaccines and prepare forced inoculations, and feed us GMOs that sterilize every mammal species that's fed them within three generations.
[00:29:12.759 --> 00:29:15.281]  We're now into the second generation of eating this stuff.
[00:29:15.281 --> 00:29:17.103]  Our fertility's almost gone.
[00:29:17.103 --> 00:29:19.324]  Sperm counts are down 90 plus percent.
[00:29:19.324 --> 00:29:21.266]  The IQs have dropped 14 points.
[00:29:21.266 --> 00:29:23.428]  Cancer's up 3,000 plus percent on average.
[00:29:23.428 --> 00:29:25.349]  Diabetes almost 3,000 percent.
[00:29:25.349 --> 00:29:26.210]  Type 2.
[00:29:26.210 --> 00:29:31.995]  We're under hardcore attack and you're too busy sucking your thumb having full imaginary victories watching Mr. Maddow!
[00:29:33.769 --> 00:29:39.435]  What is it you don't get about this jackass that I've transcended all your fake left-right garbage?
[00:29:39.435 --> 00:29:48.545]  We're under globalist total attack and you can't even figure it out because you're too busy watching television and obsessing over the rebel flag all day!
[00:29:48.545 --> 00:29:49.946]  We're on the march.
[00:29:49.946 --> 00:29:52.469]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:52.469 --> 00:29:55.172]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:00.967 --> 00:30:13.980]  From bioweapons and genetic modification to autonomous killing machines and the surveillance state, engineers and scientists are busy creating technologies that could result in billions of people dying or living as slaves.
[00:30:13.980 --> 00:30:17.384]  Michael Crichton put it this way 25 years ago in Jurassic Park.
[00:30:18.510 --> 00:30:19.630]  They're technicians.
[00:30:19.630 --> 00:30:20.651]  They don't have intelligence.
[00:30:20.651 --> 00:30:23.372]  They have what I call thin intelligence.
[00:30:23.372 --> 00:30:25.753]  They see the immediate situation.
[00:30:25.753 --> 00:30:28.373]  They think narrowly and they call it being focused.
[00:30:28.373 --> 00:30:29.734]  They don't see the surround.
[00:30:29.734 --> 00:30:31.715]  They don't see the consequences.
[00:30:31.715 --> 00:30:34.616]  That's how you get an island like Jurassic Park.
[00:30:34.616 --> 00:30:36.916]  From thin, intelligent thinking.
[00:30:36.916 --> 00:30:39.818]  Because you can't make an animal and not expect it to act alive.
[00:30:39.818 --> 00:30:41.298]  To be unpredictable.
[00:30:41.298 --> 00:30:42.538]  To escape.
[00:30:42.538 --> 00:30:44.439]  But they don't see that.
[00:30:44.439 --> 00:30:46.720]  Ellie said, you want to turn back the clock?
[00:30:47.615 --> 00:30:49.497]  No, Malcolm said.
[00:30:49.497 --> 00:30:52.941]  I want people to wake up.
[00:30:52.941 --> 00:30:56.164]  So do I. For InfoWars.com, I'm David Knight.
[00:30:58.973 --> 00:30:59.913]  Hey, how you doing, Al?
[00:30:59.913 --> 00:31:00.493]  Good, brother.
[00:31:00.493 --> 00:31:02.214]  Just recently started using your products.
[00:31:02.214 --> 00:31:04.155]  Everything you said about them is correct.
[00:31:04.155 --> 00:31:08.156]  Me and my wife both use a lot of them, and it's made a lot of changes in our lives here.
[00:31:08.156 --> 00:31:10.797]  Well, thank you, brother, because it also funds our operation.
[00:31:10.797 --> 00:31:13.217]  But doing that, I know I've got to have the highest quality.
[00:31:13.217 --> 00:31:21.140]  Super Mill Vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes instead of using synthetic chemicals.
[00:31:21.400 --> 00:31:24.644]  We do the super male and the super female vitality.
[00:31:24.644 --> 00:31:26.185]  Big changes, a lot of energy.
[00:31:26.185 --> 00:31:29.229]  We've gotten off the cheap energy drinks, energy shots.
[00:31:29.229 --> 00:31:30.871]  Saving a ton of money there.
[00:31:30.871 --> 00:31:33.593]  Sourced from powerful organic herbs.
[00:31:33.593 --> 00:31:36.677]  Harvested around the planet and then concentrated.
[00:31:36.917 --> 00:31:38.718]  Or maximum potency.
[00:31:38.718 --> 00:31:48.924]  They want to stun and dumb down and energy drinks and stuff just cover that up for a while, but then burn you out in my experience, whereas stuff that gets your glands naturally going, goes right to the source.
[00:31:48.924 --> 00:31:50.726]  So, it's pretty exciting and I love it.
[00:31:50.726 --> 00:31:57.650]  Visit InfoWarsLife.com today to secure your super male vitality and other powerful products from InfoWars Life.
[00:31:58.996 --> 00:32:18.736]  Ladies and gentlemen, you haven't really ever heard firearms manufacturers as sponsors on my syndicated radio show, or the nightly news, or the news website, InfoWars.com, because the companies I've been approached by were not the highest quality, and they weren't as affordable as they should be, so I refused probably 30, 40 firearms manufacturers over the years.
[00:32:18.736 --> 00:32:19.177]  Well then,
[00:32:19.497 --> 00:32:23.400]  About six months ago, we get contacted by Head Down Firearms.
[00:32:23.400 --> 00:32:25.102]  Hdfirearms.com.
[00:32:25.102 --> 00:32:28.425]  Owned and run by a bunch of former Navy SEALs, special ops people.
[00:32:28.425 --> 00:32:33.529]  They're veterans, they're patriots, they're listeners of the radio show, and they want to support the broadcast.
[00:32:33.529 --> 00:32:37.472]  It's always about security, whether it's for yourself, your wife, your loved ones.
[00:32:37.472 --> 00:32:39.854]  Go to their website, hdfirearms.com.
[00:32:39.854 --> 00:32:44.258]  Buy right off their website, and they'll just send it to the FFL dealer of your choice.
[00:32:44.258 --> 00:32:45.759]  You can pick it up at the gun show, you can
[00:32:45.779 --> 00:32:47.620]  You pick it up at a local sporting goods store.
[00:32:47.620 --> 00:32:51.963]  Whatever you do, get your Head Down firearm today.
[00:32:51.963 --> 00:32:56.645]  The spirit of 1776 lives at Head Down Firearms.
[00:32:56.645 --> 00:32:59.747]  HDfirearms.com.
[00:32:59.747 --> 00:33:04.610]  As the community moves towards despotism, respect is restricted to fewer people.
[00:33:07.503 --> 00:33:16.705]  That's veteran Denver Police Officer Charles Jones IV smashing an unarmed suspect in the face six times.
[00:33:16.705 --> 00:33:20.806]  Officers accused of using excessive force on a suspect and then trying to erase the evidence.
[00:33:20.806 --> 00:33:23.207]  I'm observing what they're doing in their own safety.
[00:33:23.207 --> 00:33:25.628]  I don't understand what's going on.
[00:33:25.628 --> 00:33:35.210]  A community rates low on an information scale when the press, radio, and other channels of communication are controlled by only a few people.
[00:33:36.249 --> 00:33:44.012]  Does it raise ethical questions about the use of government money to produce stories about the government that wind up being aired with no disclosure that they were produced by the government?
[00:33:44.012 --> 00:33:45.732]  How can you ask such a question?
[00:33:45.732 --> 00:33:48.513]  What difference at this point does it make?
[00:33:48.513 --> 00:33:55.595]  When a confident observer looks for signs of despotism in the community, he looks beyond fine words and noble phrases.
[00:33:55.595 --> 00:34:03.198]  There are actions I have the legal authority to take as president that will help make our immigration system more fair and more just.
[00:34:04.364 --> 00:34:06.607]  Tonight, I'm announcing those actions.
[00:34:06.607 --> 00:34:07.909]  What I say, go.
[00:34:07.909 --> 00:34:08.470]  See?
[00:34:08.470 --> 00:34:13.037]  I'm the law around here.
[00:34:13.037 --> 00:34:15.220]  He came, you saw, he died.
[00:34:18.446 --> 00:34:24.909]  Yes, in modern warfare, our military leaders are finding that words and ideas are highly effective weapons.
[00:34:24.909 --> 00:34:26.730]  We just have to be repetitive about this.
[00:34:26.730 --> 00:34:34.053]  We need to do this every day of the week and just really brainwash people into thinking about guns in a vastly different way.
[00:34:34.053 --> 00:34:36.414]  We are trained to deceive if we have to.
[00:34:36.414 --> 00:34:38.095]  You really don't have to trust me.
[00:34:38.095 --> 00:34:38.915]  You shouldn't trust me.
[00:34:38.915 --> 00:34:42.977]  In fact, by my actually participating that, I will taint the news.
[00:34:42.977 --> 00:34:46.198]  In communities of this kind, despotism stands a good chance.
[00:34:48.139 --> 00:34:54.105]  Nine most terrifying words in the English language are, I'm from the government and I'm here to help.
[00:34:54.105 --> 00:34:59.410]  Oh goodness you, well we're gonna do everything we can to help you.
[00:34:59.410 --> 00:35:03.394]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[00:35:03.394 --> 00:35:06.096]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[00:35:06.096 --> 00:35:08.579]  Because there is a rule of law on your mind.
[00:35:11.914 --> 00:35:32.871]  What the system has done is push and promoted mindless trendiness, mindless fashion, mindless cultural Marxism, political correctness, to a point where about half the public would jump off a cliff if they were told to do it, or they'd be called racist, or homophobic, or sexist.
[00:35:34.482 --> 00:35:43.892]  But as many historians have pointed out, and as history has showed, and as many of our guests have pointed out, like Gerald Salente on Monday, don't get down and don't feel bad like I do.
[00:35:43.892 --> 00:35:47.115]  I'm kind of giving myself a pep talk, but it's true.
[00:35:47.115 --> 00:35:54.383]  When we run into people that are just so invincibly ignorant, that's a term my dad used when I was a kid.
[00:35:54.383 --> 00:35:56.225]  Invincibly ignorant.
[00:35:57.898 --> 00:36:00.999]  I mean, we know we're right about the trilateral plan.
[00:36:00.999 --> 00:36:03.920]  We know we're right about where the global government goes.
[00:36:03.920 --> 00:36:09.542]  We know we're right about the hellish technocracy that they call it.
[00:36:09.542 --> 00:36:11.163]  A totalitarian technocracy.
[00:36:11.163 --> 00:36:13.964]  That's their words at Davos.
[00:36:13.964 --> 00:36:17.466]  Where they say, we need a totalitarian technocracy.
[00:36:17.466 --> 00:36:23.628]  The foreign editor of the Financial Times of London wrote an article like six years ago titled, and now for world government.
[00:36:26.015 --> 00:36:28.096]  And you wrote a follow-up article criticizing me.
[00:36:28.096 --> 00:36:34.180]  And the article says, yeah, we're secretive, yeah, we're totalitarian, but we know what's best.
[00:36:34.180 --> 00:36:35.201]  They use those words!
[00:36:35.201 --> 00:36:36.702]  And then I sit here...
[00:36:39.599 --> 00:36:47.605]  With mainstream media calling me up all the time wanting to do interviews and they go, it's just the Wall Street Journal or the LA Times or ABC Nightly News or all of them.
[00:36:47.605 --> 00:36:48.226]  We'd like to come.
[00:36:48.226 --> 00:36:49.487]  What do you want to talk about?
[00:36:49.487 --> 00:36:52.209]  Well, your belief that there's a secret plan for a world government.
[00:36:52.209 --> 00:36:53.710]  And I go, there's not a secret plan.
[00:36:53.710 --> 00:36:54.171]  It's public.
[00:36:54.171 --> 00:36:55.232]  Let me give you quotes.
[00:36:55.232 --> 00:36:56.673]  And we don't want to talk about those quotes.
[00:36:56.673 --> 00:36:59.335]  We're going to talk about your beliefs.
[00:36:59.335 --> 00:37:01.657]  What do you think about UFOs?
[00:37:01.657 --> 00:37:03.298]  Like, well, I don't really talk about UFOs.
[00:37:03.298 --> 00:37:05.720]  I talk about, let me tell you about Barry Goldwater.
[00:37:05.720 --> 00:37:07.201]  No, I think we're good.
[00:37:07.201 --> 00:37:07.341]  Yeah.
[00:37:11.508 --> 00:37:13.490]  I mean, think about these traders.
[00:37:13.490 --> 00:37:24.563]  World government is coming out in the open with world taxes and plans to shut off resources with the Pope running around quarterbacking that they're going to redistribute wealth.
[00:37:24.563 --> 00:37:30.469]  You got Bernie Sanders here, the little baby Pope, the socialist, and you got Big Daddy Pope over here.
[00:37:30.469 --> 00:37:32.592]  And folks know, I don't attack
[00:37:33.953 --> 00:37:36.414]  Christian leaders, Muslim leaders, anybody.
[00:37:36.414 --> 00:37:39.395]  I don't get into the whole Protestant-Catholic fight.
[00:37:39.395 --> 00:37:44.196]  I know great Protestants, great Catholics, and it's the Catholics I know that are really freaked out.
[00:37:44.196 --> 00:37:47.697]  This Pope is super bad news.
[00:37:47.697 --> 00:37:49.897]  I mean, whoa!
[00:37:49.897 --> 00:37:51.138]  I always remember growing up hearing,
[00:37:52.037 --> 00:37:58.201]  And then when the Antichrist prepares to rise up, they'll put one of their people in the Vatican and the Pope will be the false prophet.
[00:37:58.201 --> 00:37:59.542]  I'm like, oh yeah, right.
[00:37:59.542 --> 00:38:05.005]  Well, hey, whether the devil's real or not, I'm here to tell you this new Pope is the false prophet.
[00:38:05.005 --> 00:38:10.489]  He fits the bill in every respect.
[00:38:10.489 --> 00:38:15.292]  I mean, I remember past Popes like fought communism and helped bring down the Soviet Union.
[00:38:15.292 --> 00:38:18.514]  Pope John Paul II and people did a lot of really good things.
[00:38:18.514 --> 00:38:19.215]  This guy
[00:38:20.447 --> 00:38:24.508]  Ratzinger looked like Emperor Palpatine, but he didn't do stuff like this.
[00:38:24.508 --> 00:38:30.670]  This new guy, it's like having Fidel Castro as the Pope.
[00:38:30.670 --> 00:38:32.951]  And again, we're just supposed to just put up with it.
[00:38:32.951 --> 00:38:34.132]  Oh, you want world government?
[00:38:34.132 --> 00:38:35.892]  Oh, you want carbon taxes?
[00:38:35.892 --> 00:38:39.253]  For the poor.
[00:38:39.253 --> 00:38:45.355]  And you know, the mainstream media attacks Catholics and Popes in the past.
[00:38:45.355 --> 00:38:47.056]  When you turn on mainstream media, that's all you saw.
[00:38:48.041 --> 00:38:51.562]  And leftist pedo guilds trying to take it over and stuff.
[00:38:51.562 --> 00:38:55.824]  But as soon as this new Pope got in, it was like, oh my gosh, it's like the second coming of Christ.
[00:38:55.824 --> 00:38:56.664]  He's so sweet.
[00:38:56.664 --> 00:38:57.725]  He's so loving.
[00:38:57.725 --> 00:38:58.865]  He helps poor people.
[00:38:58.865 --> 00:39:00.126]  He feeds children.
[00:39:00.126 --> 00:39:02.266]  He saves kitty cats out of trees.
[00:39:02.266 --> 00:39:04.967]  I mean, he is like Mother Teresa as a man.
[00:39:04.967 --> 00:39:07.788]  We just really need to get down on our knees to this guy.
[00:39:07.788 --> 00:39:13.651]  And he's pushing the exact same agenda of Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan and the EU and the New World Order.
[00:39:13.651 --> 00:39:13.951]  I mean,
[00:39:15.202 --> 00:39:26.447]  You talk about anathema to freedom, this Pope is the polar opposite of what's good.
[00:39:26.447 --> 00:39:30.949]  And he does it slickly and lovingly, just like Barack Obama.
[00:39:30.949 --> 00:39:33.850]  And you notice we got socialists coming out of the woodwork and communists.
[00:39:37.534 --> 00:39:38.795]  They're all activating.
[00:39:38.795 --> 00:39:42.377]  The Red Brigades are running around in Austin and Dallas and everywhere I go.
[00:39:42.377 --> 00:39:44.939]  I see folks running around with red flags.
[00:39:44.939 --> 00:39:49.902]  Without even trying, I caught two different Communist marches the last two months on tape.
[00:39:49.902 --> 00:39:51.063]  Just what's all that chanting?
[00:39:51.063 --> 00:40:00.129]  You're like in a restaurant, you look out and there's 400 Communists running by, burning American flags and knocking people over.
[00:40:00.129 --> 00:40:01.190]  It's just, this is it.
[00:40:03.629 --> 00:40:06.270]  And again, I'm not saying it's a communist conspiracy.
[00:40:06.270 --> 00:40:13.572]  At its heart, the globalists use communist collectivist ideologies as their control mechanism with the dumb masses.
[00:40:13.572 --> 00:40:17.133]  I was reading a... It was a CNN article this morning.
[00:40:17.133 --> 00:40:18.073]  It was like 6.30 in the morning.
[00:40:18.073 --> 00:40:22.334]  I should have printed it, but... And it was like... No, it was ABC News.
[00:40:22.334 --> 00:40:25.235]  It was ten super fans of Bernie Sanders.
[00:40:25.235 --> 00:40:26.776]  And it was like, I'm a socialist.
[00:40:26.776 --> 00:40:28.316]  I want a socialist utopia.
[00:40:28.316 --> 00:40:30.397]  And I don't want to pay off my student loans.
[00:40:30.397 --> 00:40:31.677]  And I want other people to pay for it.
[00:40:32.878 --> 00:40:42.107]  I mean, it read like a nightmare of theft, but I had to realize, no, no, this is for the average American to read that and go, yeah, I want free stuff.
[00:40:42.107 --> 00:40:48.293]  Oh, you'll get free stuff like Cuba and Venezuela that have collapsed repeatedly.
[00:40:48.293 --> 00:40:54.719]  I always hear people go, man, we're going to have great free health care like Canada.
[00:40:54.719 --> 00:40:56.801]  Every Canadian I know comes down here for health care.
[00:40:56.801 --> 00:40:57.922]  It's horrible.
[00:40:59.278 --> 00:41:00.959]  We need a national health service like England!
[00:41:00.959 --> 00:41:02.200]  It's wonderful!
[00:41:02.200 --> 00:41:03.541]  CNN told me so!
[00:41:03.541 --> 00:41:04.581]  Oh, really?
[00:41:04.581 --> 00:41:11.146]  Is that why Paul Watson, when he had strep throat a few years ago, couldn't, for a month, get any antibiotics?
[00:41:11.146 --> 00:41:16.169]  They just kept giving him a little pack of, like, gloves and aspirin?
[00:41:16.169 --> 00:41:19.011]  Did he just go home and die?
[00:41:19.011 --> 00:41:23.774]  He couldn't get permission from them to go see a private doctor.
[00:41:23.774 --> 00:41:25.015]  You have to get permission.
[00:41:26.138 --> 00:41:28.220]  from the government to go see a private doctor.
[00:41:28.220 --> 00:41:34.786]  And if you're not on the in crowd, the ring knocking crowd, you don't get to get in.
[00:41:34.786 --> 00:41:37.489]  Thank God he just got better with herbal stuff.
[00:41:37.489 --> 00:41:45.897]  But he was like out for like three weeks, coughing up blood, kept going, begging for help, had money, just knew we're sorry.
[00:41:45.897 --> 00:41:47.479]  And then the average moron
[00:41:49.989 --> 00:42:00.958]  Because they've got a Obama sticker on their car, thinks the healthcare is going to be great as we watch healthcare prices explode and the economy collapse.
[00:42:00.958 --> 00:42:02.359]  Which is the plan.
[00:42:02.359 --> 00:42:04.201]  So I'm not trying to be nasty and negative here.
[00:42:04.201 --> 00:42:05.222]  I've just had enough.
[00:42:05.222 --> 00:42:12.328]  I mean... By the way, Nico, I meant to ask you in the break, how's it going with Harry Dent?
[00:42:15.100 --> 00:42:34.969]  Good, good, because he's the guy that has just been, as of late, he's been predicting stuff for more than 20 years actually, and a best-selling author, but I mean he's been dead on about so much, and I want to get his take on the China situation, because he's been saying that he believes it's imminent,
[00:42:35.990 --> 00:42:38.532]  By the end of the year, China would go belly up.
[00:42:38.532 --> 00:42:44.397]  And you tune into other pundits and people and it's all just China's wonderful, China's great.
[00:42:44.397 --> 00:42:45.698]  If you don't like it, you're racist.
[00:42:45.698 --> 00:42:47.820]  I've actually been hearing that.
[00:42:47.820 --> 00:42:50.202]  And again, if you don't like gangrene, you're racist.
[00:42:50.202 --> 00:42:54.445]  And if you don't like Jade Helm troops on the street, you're racist.
[00:42:54.445 --> 00:42:58.549]  They had hardball attack us last night about our deep racism.
[00:42:58.549 --> 00:43:00.050]  We just don't trust the black president.
[00:43:01.579 --> 00:43:04.762]  I didn't trust Bush getting rid of the posse comitatus.
[00:43:04.762 --> 00:43:06.963]  This is all part of a bipartisan takeover.
[00:43:06.963 --> 00:43:14.369]  But Obama is their front man, and they do use the fact that he's part African to have a shield.
[00:43:14.369 --> 00:43:22.576]  So they make it racial, and then we have no other choice but to point it out.
[00:43:22.576 --> 00:43:25.899]  And we're so paralyzed because of it.
[00:43:25.899 --> 00:43:29.922]  It's like race and sex issues have become the Chiari darts.
[00:43:31.294 --> 00:43:43.060]  Brazilian natives, you know, will shoot monkeys for dinner and birds for dinner with little blowgun darts that are dipped in curare.
[00:43:43.060 --> 00:43:45.161]  And it paralyzes them and they can just throw them in their bag.
[00:43:45.161 --> 00:43:45.641]  They're still alive.
[00:43:45.641 --> 00:43:47.822]  They get home and roast them.
[00:43:47.822 --> 00:43:50.623]  Don't need refrigeration when you've got paralyzation.
[00:43:50.623 --> 00:43:51.944]  Paralytics, I guess you call them.
[00:43:53.379 --> 00:43:55.320]  And that's what political correctness is.
[00:43:55.320 --> 00:44:10.486]  Just disease, crime pouring over, Latin America collapsing, seven million people worldwide, the West collapsing, globalists destabilizing any country that tries to get on its feet to bring down the third world, then flooding everybody with it.
[00:44:10.486 --> 00:44:15.548]  And you point it out, and racist, and then everybody just says, okay, open the border, uh, curare d'arte.
[00:44:17.551 --> 00:44:21.794]  When I had my hernia surgery, they said, uh, yeah, we don't really use a lot of chemicals anymore.
[00:44:21.794 --> 00:44:28.019]  It turned out the anesthesiologist was a listener who I'd actually known back in college.
[00:44:28.019 --> 00:44:32.462]  And, uh, when he was a graduate student and then we had a nice 20 minute talk before he knocked me out and he says, don't worry.
[00:44:32.462 --> 00:44:35.544]  He goes, I know you said the last time he got knocked out for surgery, it took nine times.
[00:44:35.544 --> 00:44:36.545]  That was when you were 16.
[00:44:36.545 --> 00:44:39.006]  They also call that the teenager effect.
[00:44:39.006 --> 00:44:41.108]  Sometimes teenagers, it takes a lot to put them under.
[00:44:41.108 --> 00:44:44.831]  He said, ah, I think you'll take the normal dose for a 235 pound guy.
[00:44:44.831 --> 00:44:46.292]  Took him double the curare.
[00:44:47.577 --> 00:44:49.218]  And maybe that's what it is.
[00:44:49.218 --> 00:44:50.899]  Maybe politically, too.
[00:44:50.899 --> 00:45:11.949]  There's a point where I'll finally go under and just submit and go, I'm sorry, I kneel to the Pope and world government and the new corporate government and the new Christ leader that will rise, that will be endorsed as our Gaia leader, and then I'll just say, chop the right-wingers' heads off, and I'll wear a pink tutu and just hop around going, liberal, liberal!
[00:45:11.949 --> 00:45:15.411]  I mean, you know, maybe at some point,
[00:45:17.853 --> 00:45:32.896]  Maybe now I'll just kneel, kneel to the Pope and just, yes, world government, communism is the answer, Che Guevara, you are right, oh yes, I mean, it's Twilight Zone!
[00:45:32.896 --> 00:45:40.457]  And have you noticed how sickeningly accurate this radio show is, and how everything we talk about just keeps happening?
[00:45:40.457 --> 00:45:44.938]  I don't like that, as I've said a thousand times, or more.
[00:45:44.938 --> 00:45:46.938]  It's like a slow motion car wreck.
[00:45:48.638 --> 00:45:55.484]  Or like watching one of my children being skinned alive or something in slow motion.
[00:45:55.484 --> 00:45:59.287]  I mean, I don't hate the idiots that are under a mind control trance.
[00:45:59.287 --> 00:46:02.089]  I don't hate the people that were inducted into all this stuff.
[00:46:02.089 --> 00:46:05.052]  But they're still dangerous as a horde of idiots.
[00:46:07.682 --> 00:46:18.665]  In fact, we do have a clip now of Pope Francis at the Vatican this morning when he called for world government, and we're going to play that clip right now.
[00:46:18.665 --> 00:46:32.649]  In order to ensure the security and continuing stability, the Republic will be reorganized into the First Galactic Empire!
[00:46:35.179 --> 00:46:37.541]  For a safe and secure society!
[00:46:37.541 --> 00:46:45.308]  Can you put the headline up, about calls for world government, please?
[00:46:45.308 --> 00:46:47.450]  That was in the BBC last week.
[00:46:47.450 --> 00:46:49.411]  Just keep it going, though.
[00:46:49.411 --> 00:46:53.755]  This is how freedom dies, to thunderous applause.
[00:46:53.755 --> 00:46:57.478]  And, you know, I'm laughing about all this because I'm not going to get depressed.
[00:46:57.478 --> 00:47:01.942]  And so many people say, Alex, people are waking up, some good things are happening, I get it, but in my gut,
[00:47:09.133 --> 00:47:24.391]  So he's calling for a new world order, an ecological economic order, meaning socialism and fascist tyranny through the Green Police, and again a few weeks ago called specifically for a planetary government to carry this out.
[00:47:24.391 --> 00:47:27.535]  For everyone's security and prosperity, of course.
[00:47:29.309 --> 00:47:31.271]  Remember this article from June 23rd?
[00:47:31.271 --> 00:47:43.460]  We broke a secret tech stock program with Google cars in Austin and all over the state, busily running into people.
[00:47:43.460 --> 00:47:47.723]  Well, here it is out of AP.
[00:47:47.723 --> 00:47:54.168]  Today, Google tests driverless cars in Austin, but don't worry, with safety drivers.
[00:47:54.168 --> 00:47:56.410]  Again, I'm just saying, we broke that, see?
[00:47:58.749 --> 00:47:59.850]  We broke that two weeks ago.
[00:47:59.850 --> 00:48:02.712]  Stop bragging.
[00:48:02.712 --> 00:48:04.133]  Just continuing.
[00:48:04.133 --> 00:48:05.995]  We're not the conspiracy theorist.
[00:48:05.995 --> 00:48:13.401]  When they call someone a conspiracy theorist, that means a thinking person who's not in a trance, who gets in the way of the known liars.
[00:48:13.401 --> 00:48:22.388]  And then, yeah, there are a lot of lay folks out there that are just not waking up that come up with wild theories because, I mean, if the mainstream media is lying
[00:48:27.975 --> 00:48:34.200]  If the mainstream media is lying and then you've got to go find out what the truth is, you're going to have a lot of speculation.
[00:48:34.200 --> 00:48:44.808]  And they can go out and show our different speculation about what's happening to then try to discredit us like we're a whole cacophony or tower of Babel not knowing what we're talking about.
[00:48:44.808 --> 00:48:47.470]  Well, that's the general public trying to suss stuff out.
[00:48:48.070 --> 00:49:04.785]  I know what's going on because I've read Carol Quigley's books, I've read Zbigniew Brzezinski's books, I've read David Rockefeller's books, I've read their op-ed pieces, I've read Foreign Affairs, I've read declassified congressional Frank Church reports, I have read the memoirs of these people.
[00:49:05.606 --> 00:49:07.107]  Helmut Schmidt and the rest of them.
[00:49:07.107 --> 00:49:08.869]  I've infiltrated Bohemian Grove.
[00:49:08.869 --> 00:49:13.572]  I've interviewed former MI6 officers like John Coleman, Dr. John Coleman.
[00:49:13.572 --> 00:49:15.534]  I've interviewed the Special Forces commanders.
[00:49:15.534 --> 00:49:19.878]  I've interviewed the former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Admiral Moore, repeatedly.
[00:49:19.878 --> 00:49:23.280]  I've interviewed them on and off air.
[00:49:23.280 --> 00:49:25.642]  I know what's going on.
[00:49:25.642 --> 00:49:27.624]  They know what's going on.
[00:49:30.066 --> 00:49:36.449]  And so they just denied, denied, denied with the brainwashed public not understanding what's going on.
[00:49:36.449 --> 00:49:39.430]  And then now China's stock market has plunged 30%.
[00:49:39.430 --> 00:49:54.256]  Trillions and trillions have been lost and the Financial Times of London and others are asking, is this the new 1929?
[00:49:54.256 --> 00:49:58.118]  Well, I'm sure if we give unlimited trillions to select banks to prop it up,
[00:49:59.209 --> 00:50:02.552]  Which is now happening in China.
[00:50:02.552 --> 00:50:10.941]  While all Western eyes remain firmly focused on Greece, a potentially much more significant financial crisis is developing on the other side of the world.
[00:50:10.941 --> 00:50:22.433]  In some quarters, it's already being called China's 1929, the year of the most infamous stock market crash in history and the start of the economic catastrophe of the Great Depression, which of course led to a giant war.
[00:50:24.696 --> 00:50:39.782]  In any normal summer, a 30% fall of the Chinese stock market, a loss of value roughly equivalent to the UK's entire economic output last year, after an ascent which has seen share prices more than double in the span of a year, would have been front page news across the globe.
[00:50:39.782 --> 00:50:41.343]  Then it goes into how it isn't.
[00:50:41.343 --> 00:50:44.184]  The drastic series of government interventions to stem the panic.
[00:50:45.120 --> 00:50:50.624]  And of course it's that government intervention to certain funds that is the real robbery going on.
[00:50:50.624 --> 00:50:56.208]  And then now they've halted trading on the New York Stock Exchange and they say it was a glitch.
[00:50:56.208 --> 00:50:57.609]  More lies.
[00:50:57.609 --> 00:50:58.329]  More fraud.
[00:50:59.469 --> 00:51:05.714]  So Mark and his wife came over to see my wife and me, and he began talking about the 4th of July, Independence Day, you know?
[00:51:05.714 --> 00:51:10.218]  And he said, Guns80.com's having a really awesome special for the 4th of July.
[00:51:10.218 --> 00:51:12.820]  Celebrate your independence with the pistols now.
[00:51:12.820 --> 00:51:15.022]  The pistol kit's $4.99.
[00:51:15.022 --> 00:51:16.663]  That's right, $4.99.
[00:51:16.663 --> 00:51:20.587]  And the Hillary special is backed by popular demand, you remember?
[00:51:20.587 --> 00:51:23.549]  230 round mags, all that.
[00:51:23.549 --> 00:51:24.630]  Guns80.com.

[00:52:08.317 --> 00:52:16.265]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[00:52:16.565 --> 00:52:21.307]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.

[00:52:59.141 --> 00:53:01.103]  Who's among the worst at keeping your data private?
[00:53:01.103 --> 00:53:04.826]  The Electronic Frontier Foundation Privacy Report says it's AT&T.
[00:53:04.826 --> 00:53:11.071]  AT&T customers need to know this when calling the Alex Jones 24-7 listen line at 1-605-562-9000.

[00:53:28.762 --> 00:53:38.006]  We the people grow cotton, weave fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from counterfeit, and carting to a private bank, having it lent back at interest, forcing taxes to service debt.
[00:53:38.066 --> 00:53:38.867]  This capitalism?
[00:53:38.867 --> 00:53:45.030]  Or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[00:53:45.030 --> 00:53:48.713]  Ted Anderson, I'm placing a free silver dollar in a book that explains our monetary system.
[00:53:48.713 --> 00:53:49.673]  Call for your copy 800-686-2237.

[00:53:51.374 --> 00:53:51.655]  That's 800-686-2237.
[00:54:02.044 --> 00:54:14.327]  Fox News and others are reporting that the Feds are saying the New York Stock Exchange shutdown was an internal computer error, not a cyber attack.
[00:54:31.667 --> 00:54:48.671]  The Chinese stock market is continuing its nosedive, as their main regulator warns of panic, as their retail investors, their novice gambler investors, we warned about on Monday, panic.
[00:54:48.671 --> 00:54:55.713]  And despite the fact they're trying to prop it up, the general public is exiting in a rout.
[00:54:55.713 --> 00:54:59.274]  So, very, very serious situation.
[00:54:59.274 --> 00:55:01.054]  We'll continue to track it throughout the day.
[00:55:03.154 --> 00:55:13.758]  Some of the other articles dealing with this are up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:55:13.758 --> 00:55:19.620]  And ABC News is breaking down how China's stock market trouble is affecting the U.S.
[00:55:19.620 --> 00:55:25.522]  China being the second largest economy in the world, investors around the world are anxious about the major slide in the Chinese stock market.
[00:55:26.681 --> 00:55:43.228]  And there's a Leanne McAdoo report that I haven't gotten to yet that I mentioned yesterday from the Nightly News on Monday, where she went out in Austin and most people were like, I don't care about Greece, they're nothing, they're small, they need to pay their bills.
[00:55:43.228 --> 00:55:49.811]  Well, we're in greater debt per capita than Greece, and most of this isn't my debt or your debt.
[00:55:49.811 --> 00:55:52.792]  I pay over 65% in some form of tax.
[00:55:52.792 --> 00:55:54.433]  Isn't that enough?
[00:55:54.433 --> 00:55:55.053]  Isn't that enough?
[00:55:56.340 --> 00:56:07.129]  Oh no, but when the economy goes under and they all tell us we've got to have bail-ins and have our bank accounts taken as they're announcing preparations to do, we'll hear, well, you've got a debt, you've got to pay it!
[00:56:07.129 --> 00:56:12.254]  Yeah, I've got to pay for all of Bernie Sanders folks' student loans.
[00:56:14.153 --> 00:56:22.357]  Your parents should have understood there was no jobs in the future with NAFTA and GATT when they paid to get you into college and when you paid for it.
[00:56:22.357 --> 00:56:24.638]  It's not my fault you got screwed over.
[00:56:24.638 --> 00:56:26.239]  I'm not here to pay for everything.
[00:56:26.239 --> 00:56:28.040]  Plus, I don't have the money.
[00:56:28.040 --> 00:56:34.603]  You could take all the middle class's money and all the nouveau riche's money and it wouldn't even run the country for two years.
[00:56:34.603 --> 00:56:35.784]  The globalists, it's different.
[00:56:37.466 --> 00:56:40.388]  But you can't redistribute their wealth because it's fiat.
[00:56:40.388 --> 00:56:41.289]  Do you understand?
[00:56:41.289 --> 00:56:44.691]  There's not enough real resources to give you everything free.
[00:56:44.691 --> 00:56:54.517]  To give you a new car, to give you smart phones, to give you a house so you can sit there and weigh 800 pounds and talk about how you're smart all day watching Rachel Maddow.
[00:56:54.517 --> 00:56:55.958]  It just doesn't exist.
[00:56:55.958 --> 00:56:59.681]  You're about to find that out.
[00:56:59.681 --> 00:57:06.465]  We've got an incredible Nigel Farage video where he challenges the leader of Greece to leave the Euro and bring down the New World Order.
[00:57:06.465 --> 00:57:07.106]  That's coming up.
[00:57:08.404 --> 00:57:09.666]  Greg Palast is coming up.
[00:57:09.666 --> 00:57:17.356]  Briefly, going into this crisis is now more important than ever to keep our bodies healthy and to
[00:57:18.860 --> 00:57:22.561]  Make sure that we're not deficient in a lot of the key compounds that are out there.
[00:57:22.561 --> 00:57:26.803]  And the biggest one is True Nation Iodine Deep Earth Source.
[00:57:26.803 --> 00:57:29.584]  We're the only source that has this True Iodine.
[00:57:29.584 --> 00:57:31.745]  I call it True Iodine because we don't have a way to describe it.
[00:57:31.745 --> 00:57:34.006]  It's just so pure and it's elemental.
[00:57:34.006 --> 00:57:35.367]  It goes right into the body.
[00:57:35.367 --> 00:57:40.188]  Consult your health care provider before you take it because it can have hardcore detox, you name it.
[00:57:40.188 --> 00:57:43.510]  The amount of energy it's given me, what it's done for my skin, I tan better.
[00:57:44.130 --> 00:57:47.171]  Just like experts said I would once I had enough iodine in me.
[00:57:47.171 --> 00:57:50.532]  It just does so many things for me personally.
[00:57:50.532 --> 00:57:51.813]  And yes, it's going to sell out.
[00:57:51.813 --> 00:57:53.914]  It's at Infowarslife.com.
[00:57:53.914 --> 00:57:56.335]  So secure yours today.
[00:57:56.335 --> 00:58:01.557]  We're down to like 1,000 bottles of Super Male, 1,500 bottles of Super Female.
[00:58:01.557 --> 00:58:03.838]  It'll be six weeks till we get that in.
[00:58:05.433 --> 00:58:09.375]  Not had the budget and not had the supply chain to get everything we need.
[00:58:09.375 --> 00:58:12.616]  So most of our products at InfoWarsLife.com are sold out.
[00:58:12.616 --> 00:58:14.998]  Our two best sellers are about to be sold out.
[00:58:14.998 --> 00:58:17.499]  We have free shipping in the month of July.
[00:58:17.499 --> 00:58:21.221]  Even though I'm about to sell out, I'm not getting rid of the free shipping.
[00:58:21.221 --> 00:58:26.883]  That continues store-wide on everything at InfoWarsStore.com or when you call toll-free 888-253-3139.
[00:58:26.883 --> 00:58:28.384]  And it's never been more important
[00:58:32.606 --> 00:58:39.433]  To fund the tip of the spear because more people are tuning in every day as they start to wake up as the hammer gets dropped.
[00:58:39.433 --> 00:58:40.694]  Second hour coming up.
[00:58:40.694 --> 00:58:42.876]  Stay with us.
[00:58:42.876 --> 00:58:43.857]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:58:49.167 --> 00:58:50.428]  Another major health threat.
[00:58:50.428 --> 00:58:55.410]  This one in Toledo, Ohio, where everybody in the entire city has been told not to drink the water.
[00:58:55.410 --> 00:58:58.071]  Ohio's governor declaring a state of emergency.
[00:58:58.071 --> 00:59:05.114]  Did you know that the average person uses about 80 to 100 gallons of water at home every single day?
[00:59:05.114 --> 00:59:08.095]  If there's a water emergency, will you be prepared?
[00:59:08.095 --> 00:59:11.056]  Panicked residents forming long lines throughout the day.
[00:59:11.056 --> 00:59:13.077]  We're here at a supermarket in Toledo.
[00:59:13.077 --> 00:59:15.918]  You can see the shelves empty where water once was.
[00:59:15.998 --> 00:59:21.722]  To stay safe and healthy during a crisis, you must have access to safe, clean water.
[00:59:21.722 --> 00:59:25.245]  Water which will not be available at your local grocery store.
[00:59:25.245 --> 00:59:28.328]  There's a mad dash on right now to stock up on supplies.
[00:59:28.328 --> 00:59:35.653]  The ProPure Pro1 G2.0 water filtration system is a must-have for every modern, independently-minded household.
[00:59:35.653 --> 00:59:38.876]  Protect your family's safety during an emergency.

[00:59:45.421 --> 00:59:45.781]  Call 1-888-253-3139.
[00:59:45.781 --> 00:59:46.963]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:00:05.120 --> 01:00:06.442]  Big Brother.
[01:00:06.442 --> 01:00:08.204]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:08.204 --> 01:00:09.965]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:09.965 --> 01:00:11.547]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.547 --> 01:00:13.109]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.109 --> 01:00:17.294]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.294 --> 01:00:22.119]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:22.119 --> 01:00:23.300]  You know, a lot of people...
[01:00:28.151 --> 01:00:29.932]  Well, say, hey Alex, aren't you happy?
[01:00:29.932 --> 01:00:32.054]  Things are going exactly as you said they would.
[01:00:32.054 --> 01:00:33.875]  Doesn't that prove you're right?
[01:00:33.875 --> 01:00:37.798]  No, it's like telling your friend, you better stop drinking.
[01:00:37.798 --> 01:00:39.780]  I had a friend that's happened to.
[01:00:39.780 --> 01:00:45.004]  An entire handle of vodka every day, or it's going to kill you.
[01:00:45.004 --> 01:00:47.326]  And he had liver failure and a bunch of other stuff and died.
[01:00:54.594 --> 01:00:59.777]  I currently know someone else this is happening to who was drinking a bottle of scotch every day.
[01:00:59.777 --> 01:01:03.539]  And then when they collapse and die, I don't go, wow, I was right, this is great.
[01:01:03.539 --> 01:01:05.279]  I'm angry.
[01:01:05.279 --> 01:01:08.901]  Because out of this new crisis, they're going to get even more power, more bailouts.
[01:01:08.901 --> 01:01:13.724]  The very criminals that have orchestrated all this will only get more power.
[01:01:14.861 --> 01:01:18.022]  And again, my brain has been burning trying to analyze this.
[01:01:18.022 --> 01:01:26.483]  Obviously, right as the Chinese stock market went into a nosedive, now 40% drop in their main index.
[01:01:26.483 --> 01:01:28.724]  That's from Time, just breaking.
[01:01:28.724 --> 01:01:33.605]  The Shenzhen composite index dropped 40%.
[01:01:33.605 --> 01:01:39.606]  Right as that began, the New York Stock Exchange had its internal glitch.
[01:01:42.526 --> 01:01:49.110]  And then just magically, that's when all this happened.
[01:01:49.110 --> 01:01:59.598]  That's because they simply went in, turned the stock market off, so there couldn't be a plunge here, to then basically manipulate the stocks and try to go into the Chinese stocks and bail them out.
[01:01:59.598 --> 01:02:04.401]  And they still haven't turned the NASDAQ completely back on.
[01:02:06.909 --> 01:02:10.372]  Because they know it will start sending our stock market down.
[01:02:10.372 --> 01:02:17.117]  But see, in the past, when they closed trading, they would admit that they did it, like on 9-11, to stop a total collapse.
[01:02:17.117 --> 01:02:19.618]  Now they just lie and say it's a computer glitch.
[01:02:19.618 --> 01:02:22.541]  The policy is a wall of lies.
[01:02:22.541 --> 01:02:26.944]  I mean, we know they turned it off and closed the market to stop a crash.
[01:02:29.235 --> 01:02:30.735]  Or to control it.
[01:02:30.735 --> 01:02:32.596]  And they just lie to us and go, no.
[01:02:32.596 --> 01:02:34.136]  And I guarantee you there'll be articles.
[01:02:34.136 --> 01:02:40.977]  Conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, uh, thinks, uh, maybe they, uh, turned it off to, uh, stop a crash.
[01:02:40.977 --> 01:02:41.937]  What a kook!
[01:02:41.937 --> 01:02:49.439]  It was just a weird glitch that would be one of the biggest stories of the year, normally, and cause huge investigations, but it'll just be papered over.
[01:02:49.439 --> 01:02:50.439]  No big deal.
[01:02:50.439 --> 01:02:52.979]  Don't have critical thinking.
[01:02:52.979 --> 01:02:56.380]  And I'm not up here on some high horse going, gee, I'm so smart.
[01:02:57.779 --> 01:02:59.440]  This is obvious.
[01:02:59.440 --> 01:03:04.364]  A lobotomized rat would know this information.
[01:03:04.364 --> 01:03:06.245]  Kit Daniels has a report on it.
[01:03:06.245 --> 01:03:09.488]  Chinese stocks collapsed right before Nasdaq shut down.
[01:03:09.488 --> 01:03:11.790]  Nasdaq's still open.
[01:03:11.790 --> 01:03:14.311]  New York Stock Exchange shut down.
[01:03:14.311 --> 01:03:21.597]  Before New York Stock Exchange shut down, Hang Seng Index plunged its most since 2008 financial crisis.
[01:03:21.597 --> 01:03:25.420]  But they say there's no connection to that.
[01:03:27.406 --> 01:03:43.881]  And there's no connection to birds flying in the sky, no connection to large aircraft flying at airports, no connection to beer and football, no connection to Bill Clinton and lying, no connection to Hillary being a terrorist and funding Al Qaeda.
[01:03:43.881 --> 01:03:48.024]  No, the truth is it's completely naked and only a moron.
[01:03:48.024 --> 01:03:51.608]  I mean, we could do an article or report just saying
[01:03:52.844 --> 01:03:55.426]  Does anybody believe that this is actually a glitch?
[01:03:55.426 --> 01:04:00.288]  It's obvious they turned the stock market off and suspended trading, which is what you do during a plunge.
[01:04:00.288 --> 01:04:06.372]  But instead of being honest about it, they'll tell all the sheeple that they just had a glitch.
[01:04:06.372 --> 01:04:09.354]  Which destroys even more confidence, because here's the deal.
[01:04:09.354 --> 01:04:10.915]  They're jumping the shark on this one.
[01:04:12.759 --> 01:04:20.221]  Even the dumbest dumbbell knows they turned the stock market off just to slow down the collapse.
[01:04:20.221 --> 01:04:29.723]  They want to have a controlled collapse, grandstand, get more global currency wars going, consolidate power before they do this.
[01:04:29.723 --> 01:04:36.945]  But this is certainly setting the stage going into the winter, as I've told everybody, for the big one.
[01:04:38.135 --> 01:04:46.422]  In 20 years of broadcast, I've never gotten up here like I've done in the last six months and said, I feel a disturbance in the force.
[01:04:46.422 --> 01:04:49.345]  The last time I felt it was in 1929.
[01:04:49.345 --> 01:04:52.527]  We'll be back, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:04:52.527 --> 01:04:53.008]  Stay with us.

[01:06:28.664 --> 01:06:29.665]  Alex Jones here.
[01:06:29.665 --> 01:06:38.972]  For the last two years, I've been working with top doctors, nutritionists, and chemists to design a nutraceutical formulation that has truly life-changing health benefits.
[01:06:38.972 --> 01:06:42.554]  Introducing the all-new Ancient Defense Herbal Immunity Blend.

[01:07:07.494 --> 01:07:15.642]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[01:07:15.882 --> 01:07:20.783]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[01:07:20.783 --> 01:07:27.565]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at Infowarslife.com.
[01:07:27.565 --> 01:07:34.647]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[01:07:34.727 --> 01:07:41.749]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[01:07:41.749 --> 01:07:46.230]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.

[01:07:55.932 --> 01:07:57.873]  Available at Infowarslife.com.
[01:08:01.505 --> 01:08:04.268]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:08:04.268 --> 01:08:07.070]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:12.645 --> 01:08:15.227]  We've been on air an hour and eight minutes.
[01:08:15.227 --> 01:08:23.174]  Ladies and gentlemen, we have seen a 40% drop across the board in the major index in the Chinese stock market.
[01:08:23.174 --> 01:08:26.517]  The Chinese economy really is the biggest economy in the world.
[01:08:26.517 --> 01:08:34.925]  They are the second largest owner of our debt behind the private, European-owned, hedge fund-run Federal Reserve.
[01:08:36.736 --> 01:08:53.102]  Right as the Chinese stock market went into nosedive this morning, the New York Stock Exchange had a, quote, glitch, not cyber related, cyber crime related, we're told, by the Securities and Exchange Commission, and it was shut down.
[01:08:53.102 --> 01:08:59.644]  We also had United Airlines flights grounded all morning with a total computer shutdown.
[01:08:59.644 --> 01:09:01.685]  Now, a couple things can be happening here.
[01:09:01.685 --> 01:09:05.026]  The Chinese stock market has been overvalued up 100% in the last year.
[01:09:07.162 --> 01:09:09.343]  The government openly pumps money into it.
[01:09:09.343 --> 01:09:12.545]  It's as phony as ours.
[01:09:12.545 --> 01:09:15.387]  So it's time for it to go down.
[01:09:15.387 --> 01:09:17.208]  The global economy is in deep trouble.
[01:09:17.208 --> 01:09:21.931]  The globalists, the big insiders, ride these things up and down.
[01:09:21.931 --> 01:09:24.853]  The Greece situation, the EU in trouble, all of this.
[01:09:26.863 --> 01:09:32.664]  It could be a coincidence, but my gut tells me that this is a cyber war between the U.S.
[01:09:32.664 --> 01:09:33.404]  and China.
[01:09:33.404 --> 01:09:35.184]  I'm not saying that.
[01:09:35.184 --> 01:09:46.206]  I'm saying there's too many coincidences and too many other weird, because I was looking earlier, other computer systems and other companies are having total computer failures as well.
[01:09:46.206 --> 01:09:48.727]  And China's having computer failures.
[01:09:48.727 --> 01:09:53.268]  So China has its stock market plunging, even though they're trying to prop it up.
[01:09:53.268 --> 01:09:54.488]  I mean, a huge whopping 40%
[01:09:56.226 --> 01:09:59.287]  The New York Stock Exchange shuts down right as this begins.
[01:09:59.287 --> 01:10:02.768]  Was that them shutting it down?
[01:10:02.768 --> 01:10:05.188]  To protect the market and lying to the public?
[01:10:05.188 --> 01:10:07.709]  I mean, they've had market holidays before.
[01:10:07.709 --> 01:10:09.970]  9-11 and other events.
[01:10:09.970 --> 01:10:14.651]  They could have just been honest about it and said, we're shutting it down to stop the contagion.
[01:10:14.651 --> 01:10:18.432]  But as an instinct now, they lie when the truth will serve them better.
[01:10:18.432 --> 01:10:21.033]  I'm going to ask Greg Pallis right now.
[01:10:21.033 --> 01:10:23.774]  He doesn't like to speculate, but I'm going to ask him.
[01:10:23.774 --> 01:10:24.534]  Is it a cyber war?
[01:10:25.822 --> 01:10:29.250]  Is it a false flag to get cyber homeland security takeover passed?
[01:10:29.250 --> 01:10:35.324]  Is it shutting down the stock market so that it doesn't get driven down which is a normal procedure and they're just lying to us?
[01:10:36.713 --> 01:10:40.314]  Or is it really just a glitch and all this is happening?
[01:10:40.314 --> 01:10:52.378]  Greg Pallis, best-selling author, BBC and ABC News host, investigative journalist, had an arrest warrant issued by Homeland Security eight years ago because he was showing toxic waste dumping in Louisiana.
[01:10:52.378 --> 01:10:53.559]  It was under the Patriot Act.
[01:10:53.559 --> 01:10:58.260]  Showing that is an Infrastructure Protection Act violation.
[01:10:58.260 --> 01:11:00.941]  Traveled to Greece many times during the last collapse.
[01:11:00.941 --> 01:11:05.963]  We got him set up today to talk about Greece, the EU, what's happening on that front, but
[01:11:06.583 --> 01:11:13.330]  Now, clearly we're not being told the truth about the biggest shake-up in the markets we've seen since 2008, Greg Palast.
[01:11:13.330 --> 01:11:20.918]  You were formerly one of the top federal crime investigators during the savings and loan and other events, so you're an expert on this.
[01:11:20.918 --> 01:11:22.760]  You live in New York City.
[01:11:22.760 --> 01:11:28.246]  What does your gut tell you is really going on right now, Greg Palast of gregpalast.com?
[01:11:29.209 --> 01:11:31.551]  Well, as you know, you said it right.
[01:11:31.551 --> 01:11:34.995]  I don't speculate and I don't guess.
[01:11:34.995 --> 01:11:41.502]  So all I can do, but now I'm going to have to just, all I can do is tell you what I believe and what I think is probably going on.
[01:11:41.502 --> 01:11:43.504]  But again, I would really have to investigate it.
[01:11:43.504 --> 01:11:48.909]  It has all the earmarks of a quick shutdown to stop an instant collapse.
[01:11:48.909 --> 01:11:49.510]  Keep in mind,
[01:11:49.850 --> 01:11:52.331]  And they're programmed to shut down for what I've been told now.
[01:12:10.515 --> 01:12:24.411]  Yes, so what happens is when there's a certain imbalance between buy orders and sell orders, for example, there's a massive number of sell orders against Western companies with big China holdings, which we're seeing right now.
[01:12:24.411 --> 01:12:29.077]  And also at the same time, the Greek banks have been closed and they're shaky.
[01:12:29.837 --> 01:12:31.598]  I think it's pretty clear what's happening.
[01:12:51.843 --> 01:12:53.544]  You're shutting down to stop a panic.
[01:12:53.544 --> 01:12:55.525]  You've just, you're now going to create a panic.
[01:12:55.525 --> 01:12:57.126]  So you don't say we're stopping.
[01:12:57.126 --> 01:12:58.207]  Well, I agree with you, Greg.
[01:12:58.207 --> 01:12:59.288]  That's probably what happened.
[01:12:59.288 --> 01:13:01.189]  I give it about a 98% chance.
[01:13:01.189 --> 01:13:06.693]  But correct me if wrong, they've had stock market holidays before and admitted it.
[01:13:06.693 --> 01:13:09.414]  And in a way that restores confidence because they're being honest.
[01:13:09.414 --> 01:13:12.216]  I mean, everybody knows this is a shutdown on purpose.
[01:13:12.216 --> 01:13:14.638]  So lying about it, I think only hurts confidence more.
[01:13:14.638 --> 01:13:15.538]  Here's my question.
[01:13:15.538 --> 01:13:18.240]  In the past, they were more honest about this, weren't they?
[01:13:18.240 --> 01:13:19.361]  Why are they lying about it now?
[01:13:20.148 --> 01:13:24.529]  Well, let's assume that they are lying about that as they're not giving us the full story.
[01:13:24.529 --> 01:13:38.773]  I think it's about telling these automated, the companies that are robot-selling, that the robo-systems have to take a breather for a minute before they create an unstoppable momentum.
[01:13:38.773 --> 01:13:47.456]  I mean, look, as the FBI once told me when I was investigating the business with Al-Qaeda,
[01:13:48.156 --> 01:13:51.498]  There are some things that the public ought not to know.
[01:13:51.498 --> 01:13:56.862]  That's a quote from the official quote from the FBI when I was investigating for BBC.
[01:13:56.862 --> 01:14:02.365]  So obviously they've decided that this is one more case of something the public, quote, ought not to know.
[01:14:02.365 --> 01:14:09.309]  So maybe you should be grateful that they stopped your 401k from going lower than your shoelaces, Alec.
[01:14:10.410 --> 01:14:13.032]  Sure, but it shows how rigged the markets are.
[01:14:13.032 --> 01:14:18.256]  The Chinese don't even deny that their market's completely fabricated.
[01:14:18.256 --> 01:14:23.400]  But it seems like this balancing act, this house of cards, is going into an endgame.
[01:14:23.400 --> 01:14:27.443]  A strong wind is coming, a storm is coming.
[01:14:27.443 --> 01:14:31.606]  What is your prognosis on the global economy and the real players involved in it?
[01:14:32.551 --> 01:14:34.634]  Well, I think the 1% is doing okay.
[01:14:34.634 --> 01:14:36.516]  They're going to protect themselves.
[01:14:36.516 --> 01:14:39.179]  And as you know, I've just been writing about Greece.
[01:14:39.179 --> 01:14:42.303]  In fact, I was writing, doing something that very few people have done.
[01:14:42.303 --> 01:14:50.253]  I'm working with Greek journalists and experts from Athens, so that the article that's at gregpalace.com is actually written
[01:14:51.266 --> 01:14:58.649]  You know, not only by myself, where I've been working with Greeks for a long time, but with my colleagues on the ground in Athens.
[01:14:58.649 --> 01:15:00.330]  The 1% are going to take care of themselves.
[01:15:00.330 --> 01:15:03.651]  You see this tremendous attack on Greece.
[01:15:03.651 --> 01:15:08.914]  So what's going on here with the Euro when they're calling for massive so-called privatizations?
[01:15:08.914 --> 01:15:12.195]  Well, it's the elite taking all the properties private.
[01:15:12.195 --> 01:15:14.276]  The public beaches, the parks, the waterworks,
[01:15:15.256 --> 01:15:20.478]  Let's be clear, it's not like they go out and buy some private land and then compete next to a city beach.
[01:15:20.478 --> 01:15:24.559]  They get it for pennies on the dollar on derivatives they sold the country.
[01:15:24.559 --> 01:15:26.360]  Explain how this scam works.
[01:15:26.360 --> 01:15:30.401]  Basically you have the arsonists, the guys who started the fire.
[01:15:31.041 --> 01:15:33.222]  Buy up the stuff at the fire sale.
[01:15:33.222 --> 01:15:39.847]  Now, this started, okay, in my book, Vulture's Picnic, I went through the long investigation on this.
[01:15:39.847 --> 01:15:48.432]  What happened was, back in about 2004, 5, 6, Goldman Sachs and J.P.
[01:15:48.432 --> 01:15:57.999]  Morgan, for both Spain and Greece and a couple of other nations, were playing games where they were hiding the deficits of these nations by phony currency trades involving
[01:15:58.659 --> 01:16:00.981]  Billions and tens of billions of dollars.
[01:16:00.981 --> 01:16:02.963]  It was just absolutely stunning.
[01:16:02.963 --> 01:16:10.108]  And so the entire nation of Greece was claiming it had only a 3% deficit when it had about a 6 or 7% deficit.
[01:16:10.108 --> 01:16:19.836]  The people that bought their bonds on good faith, when this whole scam blew open, when a new government came in and said, oops, gee, these books are completely dishonest.
[01:16:20.652 --> 01:16:22.493]  As if they didn't know.
[01:16:22.493 --> 01:16:28.376]  Well, Goldman Sachs ended up taking a half-billion-dollar fee for running this scam.
[01:16:28.376 --> 01:16:33.459]  Understand, when I was an investigator with the federal government, we used to put people in jail for this stuff.
[01:16:33.459 --> 01:16:37.001]  But I guess if it was a half a million, you'd go to the prison.
[01:16:37.001 --> 01:16:41.703]  But if you get a half-billion fee, you just get a bonus.
[01:16:41.703 --> 01:16:43.764]  So the scam blew open.
[01:16:43.764 --> 01:16:46.846]  That forced Greece to now, because no one trusted them,
[01:16:47.586 --> 01:16:51.291]  To have to pay you serious fees.
[01:16:51.291 --> 01:16:54.935]  14, 15, 16 percent to pay off their debts.
[01:16:54.935 --> 01:16:55.936]  And it's just like anyone else.
[01:16:55.936 --> 01:17:05.948]  It's not that Greeks are... You know, this whole idea that Greeks are a bunch of lazy people, that they're just ouzo drinking, olive pits spitting, lazy guys who retire when they're 36 is nonsense.
[01:17:05.948 --> 01:17:06.409]  Terrible!
[01:17:07.113 --> 01:17:17.158]  Yeah, it's pure bull, and just by the way, the information, look it up at the OECD, which is the site of the Organization of Economically Developed Nations.
[01:17:17.158 --> 01:17:21.080]  Greeks who have jobs, there's 25% unemployment, Greeks who have jobs, work.
[01:17:25.990 --> 01:17:28.152]  600 hours a year more than Germans.
[01:17:28.152 --> 01:17:33.956]  So Greeks work more than anyone in the... Well, my parents, one of their favorite places to go is Greece.
[01:17:33.956 --> 01:17:35.897]  I've never been to Greece yet.
[01:17:35.897 --> 01:17:48.785]  And they say they've been there, and they say the Greeks are like working at 10 o'clock at night with their gardens and growing their own food and truck farms and running a restaurant while they go out and catch the fish.
[01:17:48.785 --> 01:17:50.767]  And I mean, it's just not true.
[01:17:50.767 --> 01:17:52.148]  The Greeks are sitting around on their butts.
[01:17:52.808 --> 01:17:58.711]  Yeah, and then the Germans actually work the fewest hours of any nation in the developed world.
[01:17:58.711 --> 01:18:04.353]  And then they put out the meme, I'm not bashing Germans, but the government does, that the Greeks are lazy.
[01:18:04.353 --> 01:18:09.596]  Yeah, this whole idea that Greeks are lazy, because it goes back to the kind of Aryan nation business.
[01:18:09.596 --> 01:18:14.818]  It's basically, there's a racial element in this which you can smell a mile away.
[01:18:14.818 --> 01:18:15.958]  Well, and that's actually true.
[01:18:15.958 --> 01:18:19.000]  Let's not forget Germany did invade Greece in 1941 with paratroopers.
[01:18:19.600 --> 01:18:22.562]  Yeah, and by the way, they borrowed.
[01:18:22.562 --> 01:18:24.064]  The Germans borrowed money.
[01:18:24.064 --> 01:18:25.445]  They owe Greece $11 billion.
[01:18:25.445 --> 01:18:27.987]  They've never paid it back, by the way.
[01:18:27.987 --> 01:18:30.129]  And now they're saying that the Greeks owe them.
[01:18:30.129 --> 01:18:35.633]  The problem of the euro, the problem of the euro is that it's not a currency, it's a disease.
[01:18:35.633 --> 01:18:43.619]  And what's happened is that the Greeks, even the Greek current government, which it's really exciting to see the Greeks stand up and say no,
[01:18:44.800 --> 01:18:46.981]  And by the way, we keep talking about the Greek crisis.
[01:18:46.981 --> 01:18:52.623]  Well, there's 25% unemployment in Greece, but there's almost that much in unemployment in Spain.
[01:18:52.623 --> 01:18:55.323]  And yet we don't talk about the Spanish crisis.
[01:18:55.323 --> 01:18:56.144]  It's not a crisis.
[01:18:56.144 --> 01:18:57.424]  It's resistance.
[01:18:57.424 --> 01:18:59.685]  The Spaniards have basically given up.
[01:18:59.685 --> 01:19:01.605]  They've just decided, look, we can't win.
[01:19:01.605 --> 01:19:03.406]  We can't beat the big powers.
[01:19:03.406 --> 01:19:09.068]  And so the poor Spaniards are, you know, one in four is out of work.
[01:19:09.608 --> 01:19:12.030]  The others are underemployed.
[01:19:12.030 --> 01:19:20.157]  It's a massive disaster in Spain, but we don't call it a crisis because basically they've agreed to the occupation by financial powers running the euro.
[01:19:20.157 --> 01:19:21.818]  Greece, the people have said no.
[01:19:21.818 --> 01:19:26.742]  On the other hand, they're told if they get rid of the euro that the sky will fall.
[01:19:26.742 --> 01:19:30.345]  It's like lepers saying, we don't want leprosy, but we don't want to leave the leper colony.
[01:19:31.556 --> 01:19:36.500]  Well, wouldn't Greece just do good now with the devalued currency because they're based on tourism?
[01:19:36.500 --> 01:19:40.302]  And to leave the Euro and just default, especially when they can never pay it?
[01:19:40.302 --> 01:19:41.263]  Stay there, Greg Pallast.

[01:21:57.999 --> 01:22:02.223]  As if chlorine in our water weren't bad enough, now they're adding ammonia?
[01:22:02.223 --> 01:22:02.864]  It's true.
[01:22:02.864 --> 01:22:07.008]  Some municipalities are now adding ammonia plus chlorine to your water supply.
[01:22:07.008 --> 01:22:09.411]  It's a disinfectant called chloramine.
[01:22:09.411 --> 01:22:13.876]  But with a trusted Big Berkey water filter, you can keep chloramine out of your water.
[01:22:14.176 --> 01:22:27.054]  New NSF EPA Certified Lab Tests show EPA Berkey Water Filters remove chloramines, pharmaceuticals, BPA, pesticides, bacteria and viruses, all forms of fluoride, and much more.

[01:22:57.766 --> 01:22:59.708]  It's very easy to be a criminal.
[01:22:59.708 --> 01:23:03.331]  All you need to burglarize a home is one simple household tool.
[01:23:03.331 --> 01:23:04.692]  A pair of scissors.
[01:23:04.692 --> 01:23:10.477]  If your home security system can be compromised by a criminal using scissors, then you're making it easy for him.
[01:23:10.477 --> 01:23:15.421]  Almost every home security system, even those sold by big-name companies, has a weakness.
[01:23:15.421 --> 01:23:16.402]  The phone line.
[01:23:16.402 --> 01:23:21.646]  You shell out $1,500, get locked into a long-term contract, and think you're safe.
[01:23:21.646 --> 01:23:25.389]  But, a burglar can destroy your alarm in seconds with one snip.
[01:23:25.549 --> 01:23:28.853]  And when a burglar cuts your phone line, you're defenseless.
[01:23:28.853 --> 01:23:31.337]  SimpliSafe Home Security is the smarter choice.
[01:23:31.337 --> 01:23:35.682]  Built by Harvard engineers, SimpliSafe uses a wireless connection to call the cops.

[01:24:12.082 --> 01:24:25.273]  Coming up after Greg Pallis leaves us, I'm going to play a report Leanne McAdoo did, where she went out and interviewed Austinites, and most of them thought Greece deserved what was happening to them with no education about it.
[01:24:25.273 --> 01:24:38.465]  And to see people sitting on top of debt, per capita, bigger than Greece's, saying, hey, it's their debt, they should pay it, shows the triumph of disinformation.
[01:24:39.500 --> 01:24:42.627]  Greg Palast, what's the next big shoe to drop?
[01:24:42.627 --> 01:24:45.112]  We've got investigative journalists joining us.
[01:24:45.112 --> 01:24:49.843]  And what are the latest big mega banking scams that you're tracking?
[01:24:51.255 --> 01:24:56.618]  I can't give you too many hints about the scams I'm tracking at this moment, of course.
[01:24:56.618 --> 01:25:03.541]  But I will say that I'm looking into some of the billionaires who are taking down the U.S.
[01:25:03.541 --> 01:25:08.923]  And of course they're behind all the candidates, both Democratic and Republican sides.
[01:25:08.923 --> 01:25:12.205]  Not every candidate, but the leading candidates.
[01:25:13.395 --> 01:25:27.689]  One of the big concerns I have is that the guys who crashed Wall Street are taking, are suddenly, these hedge fund managers are hedging their bets by buying up candidates in a way that we haven't seen in prior elections.
[01:25:27.689 --> 01:25:35.717]  Like this guy Paul the Vulture Singer, who is a multi-billionaire, who basically one of the people who took down Greece.
[01:25:38.179 --> 01:25:48.245]  Remember, when I say they took down Greece, these are guys who bankrupted the nation and then demanded their properties.
[01:25:48.245 --> 01:25:50.026]  We talk about bailouts of Greece.
[01:25:50.026 --> 01:25:51.447]  I want to make this clear.
[01:25:51.447 --> 01:25:57.952]  The European Central Bank, in its $150 billion that it's supposedly given Greece,
[01:25:58.803 --> 01:26:01.184]  Greece got zero.
[01:26:01.184 --> 01:26:02.784]  This is very, very important for people to understand.
[01:26:02.784 --> 01:26:04.024]  Greece got zero.
[01:26:04.024 --> 01:26:07.685]  The money went to Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs, J.P.
[01:26:07.685 --> 01:26:12.566]  Morgan, Credit Lyonnais, and other big banks which held Greek bonds.
[01:26:12.566 --> 01:26:27.390]  Basically, the European people paid off the Greek debts held by these big banks, which were charging monster fees, and now they're saying, okay, they're telling the Greek people, now you have to bail out our bailout.
[01:26:28.457 --> 01:26:35.826]  And it's coming down to a massive per family interest charges of $10,000 to $15,000 a year.
[01:26:35.826 --> 01:26:38.088]  And under Greek salaries, it's impossible.
[01:26:38.857 --> 01:26:39.537]  It's impossible.
[01:26:39.537 --> 01:26:40.938]  It's a mortgage that can't be paid.
[01:26:40.938 --> 01:26:57.527]  And Greg, notice the latest deal was a huge new added VAT on their only cash crop that's tourism, and the Greeks were like, wait a minute, you want to destroy us, but the documents you got back in 2002 showed that this is what these groups want, is the collapse.
[01:26:57.527 --> 01:26:59.949]  So what will the globalists ultimately do?
[01:27:01.161 --> 01:27:04.122]  To Spain and Ireland and France.
[01:27:04.122 --> 01:27:07.243]  I mean, what are the next countries that they're going to suck dry?
[01:27:07.243 --> 01:27:13.905]  Because just because Spain and others have run up the white flag, that never keeps the vampires from draining you.
[01:27:13.905 --> 01:27:15.045]  No, that's just the beginning.
[01:27:15.045 --> 01:27:17.866]  They're basically going to be taking all these assets.
[01:27:17.866 --> 01:27:25.428]  In the case of Greece, by the way, one of the big assets that they were trying to grab is Greece has tremendous offshore gas resources.
[01:27:25.428 --> 01:27:29.669]  And at the moment, obviously, the natural gas market has collapsed.
[01:27:30.229 --> 01:27:35.631]  But, believe me, they're going to be going after those resources.
[01:27:35.631 --> 01:27:38.573]  You know, we see in Ireland, Ireland actually has gold.
[01:27:38.573 --> 01:27:40.573]  They're going to be going after those resources.
[01:27:40.573 --> 01:27:41.774]  Spain has resources.
[01:27:41.774 --> 01:27:45.896]  So, basically, they're draining these nations.
[01:27:45.896 --> 01:27:50.397]  They're draining these nations of their public treasury.
[01:27:50.397 --> 01:27:52.018]  And that's what's happening.
[01:27:52.018 --> 01:27:57.760]  And the, you know, when you're talking about 25% unemployment, it also means 50% unemployment among young people.
[01:27:57.760 --> 01:27:58.781]  There's no future for them.
[01:27:59.301 --> 01:28:02.442]  There's no future for them, and this is what happens.
[01:28:02.442 --> 01:28:07.384]  Then we see violence and global reaction and wonder where does that come from?
[01:28:07.384 --> 01:28:09.005]  You can only squeeze people.
[01:28:09.005 --> 01:28:18.109]  Oh yeah, you watch Devos and they've got Soros' guy going, it's terrible, we need to redistribute wealth, but they're talking about the middle class's money to the poor.
[01:28:18.109 --> 01:28:19.949]  There is going to be no middle class.
[01:28:19.949 --> 01:28:23.551]  Where are all these robber barons going to live when they've imploded every nation?
[01:28:24.953 --> 01:28:37.098]  Well, Mark Rich was moved to Switzerland after Bill Clinton gave the multi-billionaire bandit a pardon, and so he lived there virtually tax-free.
[01:28:37.098 --> 01:28:39.319]  So that's what they're doing.
[01:28:39.319 --> 01:28:45.362]  In the case of Kenneth Dart, one of the guys who took down Greece, by the way, Kenneth Dart was a vulture investor.
[01:28:46.082 --> 01:28:50.926]  Here's an American, or he was, I shouldn't say, I shouldn't call him an American because he'll probably sue me.
[01:28:50.926 --> 01:28:52.627]  He was born in America.
[01:28:52.627 --> 01:29:02.095]  His business, he's the guy who makes the solo styrofoam cups and has made billions of dollars through stock market operations and vulture tax on poor nations.
[01:29:02.095 --> 01:29:04.697]  He gave up his American citizenship.
[01:29:05.563 --> 01:29:07.326]  He took Belize citizenship.
[01:29:07.326 --> 01:29:12.475]  He's never been to Belize in his life as I understand it, but he's now the Belize ambassador to the United States.
[01:29:12.475 --> 01:29:16.763]  So he lives in the United States tax-free and immune from arrest.
[01:29:17.745 --> 01:29:21.189]  Because he's so-called not, he's totally not an American citizen.
[01:29:21.189 --> 01:29:28.498]  And as diplomatic immunity, that's Globalism 101 with Greg Palast, gregpalast.com.
[01:29:28.498 --> 01:29:34.746]  Promise to come back soon and break down your predictions of 2002 that have now basically come true.
[01:29:34.746 --> 01:29:37.109]  Amazing job, thank you so much Greg Palast.
[01:29:39.048 --> 01:29:45.852]  Alright, we've got Harry Dent joining us coming up who made the prediction on the China situation.
[01:29:45.852 --> 01:29:48.594]  Your phone calls and the powerful speech of Nigel Farage.
[01:29:48.594 --> 01:29:52.396]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:29:52.396 --> 01:29:55.078]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:59.329 --> 01:30:02.551]  Do you have a bio-terror lab in your backyard?
[01:30:02.551 --> 01:30:04.612]  I'm not talking about freelance terrorists.
[01:30:04.612 --> 01:30:05.772]  I'm talking about U.S.
[01:30:05.772 --> 01:30:10.155]  government-sanctioned and subsidized biological weapon labs.
[01:30:10.155 --> 01:30:16.098]  A USA Today investigation revealed over 200 bio labs from New York City to a valley in Montana.
[01:30:16.098 --> 01:30:23.142]  And over 100 of those biosafety level 3 and level 4 labs, half of them, have had serious safety violations.
[01:30:23.522 --> 01:30:27.484]  This is far beyond the careless shipment of live anthrax by the U.S.
[01:30:27.484 --> 01:30:28.305]  military.
[01:30:28.305 --> 01:30:36.509]  These biolabs are weaponizing deadly bacteria, what the Pentagon calls select agents, making them more deadly and easier to catch.
[01:30:36.509 --> 01:30:38.310]  They call it gain of function.
[01:30:38.310 --> 01:30:44.333]  The House Oversight Committee is asking for details, and as one congressman says, we've been lucky, but that luck may run out.
[01:30:44.993 --> 01:30:49.199]  No, with the accident rate they've had, it's a mathematical certainty it will.
[01:30:49.199 --> 01:30:49.639]  The U.S.
[01:30:49.639 --> 01:30:55.546]  government bio-terror program is yet another dangerous and deadly federal program that shouldn't even exist.
[01:30:55.546 --> 01:30:57.989]  For InfoWars.com, I'm David Knight.
[01:30:59.039 --> 01:31:06.245]  For all of recorded history, civilizations around the world praised the health benefits of silver.

[01:32:29.565 --> 01:32:38.851]  For the last two years, I've been working with top doctors, nutritionists, and chemists to design a nutraceutical formulation that has truly life-changing health benefits.
[01:32:38.851 --> 01:32:42.673]  Introducing the all-new Ancient Defense Herbal Immunity Blend.

[01:33:21.118 --> 01:33:25.681]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:33:25.681 --> 01:33:27.862]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:33:27.862 --> 01:33:44.271]  It is Alex Jones, the wild man from Austin, Texas, coming to you live across the globe on over 170 AIM & FM affiliates, global shortwave, the internet, satellite, and of course the audio and video streams at infowars.com forward slash show.
[01:33:47.847 --> 01:33:50.989]  I've got a bunch of special reports I want to air.
[01:33:50.989 --> 01:33:53.391]  One, Jakari Jackson went out and talked to Austin Ice.
[01:33:53.391 --> 01:33:55.032]  They know what the First Amendment is.
[01:33:55.032 --> 01:33:56.654]  That's coming up in the next hour.
[01:33:56.654 --> 01:33:58.955]  I want to play this Lee Ann McAdoo report.
[01:33:58.955 --> 01:34:01.537]  Could the Greek collapse come here?
[01:34:01.537 --> 01:34:08.963]  And you've got the Austinites on average, there were some smart folks, but on average, just thinking they're totally immune and insulated from it.
[01:34:10.430 --> 01:34:20.638]  Not as stupid as folks in Southern California that, you know, 8 out of 10, 9 out of 10 don't know what Independence Day is, but 6 out of 10 here didn't, so pretty darn close.
[01:34:20.638 --> 01:34:24.561]  And again, I take no relishment out of this.
[01:34:24.561 --> 01:34:25.882]  It's very, very sad.
[01:34:25.882 --> 01:34:32.047]  We point this out so that hopefully we can ignite some type of national debate about it.
[01:34:32.047 --> 01:34:37.171]  Just like they had a national poll out yesterday that Drudge had a link to.
[01:34:37.171 --> 01:34:39.833]  19% of Americans know what the First Amendment is.
[01:34:41.266 --> 01:34:57.712]  So you wonder how the government can be run by foreign banks, you wonder how we can sign on to secret TPP, you wonder how we can be funding radical Islamists to run around and murder everybody and then take our rights at the same time to supposedly protect us from them.
[01:34:57.712 --> 01:35:01.033]  It's because the public is dumber than a box of rocks.
[01:35:01.033 --> 01:35:09.696]  But that doesn't mean the minority of us, of all race, colors and creeds that are aware, have to live under the governance of the idiots.
[01:35:10.691 --> 01:35:12.312]  That's why we're a republic.
[01:35:12.312 --> 01:35:16.753]  In a pure democracy, if 51% say you die, you die.
[01:35:16.753 --> 01:35:19.835]  If 51% say take your farm, you take your farm.
[01:35:19.835 --> 01:35:26.357]  You know, I think Greek culture is very diverse, very interesting, a whole bunch of different islands and tribes and groups.
[01:35:26.357 --> 01:35:28.258]  Very smart people.
[01:35:28.258 --> 01:35:32.200]  But they lionize democracy as the father of this country.
[01:35:32.200 --> 01:35:35.981]  We're not a democracy, we're a republic.
[01:35:35.981 --> 01:35:39.683]  Everybody uses that word like it's sickeningly delicious.
[01:35:41.002 --> 01:35:52.344]  In ancient Greece, where they first, in a few of the city-states that first got democracy, look it up, they would have a one bucket for white stones, one bucket for black stones.
[01:35:52.344 --> 01:35:57.045]  And they would say, this philosopher bad-mouthed the king.
[01:35:57.045 --> 01:36:01.286]  And we don't like that, and so we're going to vote.
[01:36:01.286 --> 01:36:04.786]  And only, of course, the gentried noble class was allowed to vote.
[01:36:04.786 --> 01:36:08.167]  Forgot that part, it was an oligarchy.
[01:36:08.167 --> 01:36:09.487]  A democracy of the oligarchy.
[01:36:11.368 --> 01:36:14.010]  A demon-ocracy.
[01:36:14.010 --> 01:36:24.718]  And they then would vote, and if there were no votes to not kill, there'd be more Blackstones put in the bucket.
[01:36:24.718 --> 01:36:31.262]  But if there were more Whitestones put in to kill, they would make you drink Hemlock, or throw you off a cliff, or strangle you.
[01:36:31.262 --> 01:36:34.165]  They'd say, oh, we voted to kill you!
[01:36:34.165 --> 01:36:38.748]  And many of the famous philosophers, you know their names, were killed by vote.
[01:36:40.382 --> 01:36:44.107]  So, you might want to find out about democracy and how deadly it is.
[01:36:44.107 --> 01:36:53.279]  I mean, they can get 51% of a moron public to then vote to take my guns or take your private property or conscript our children?
[01:36:53.279 --> 01:36:55.482]  Or make us take vaccines?
[01:36:55.482 --> 01:36:56.524]  No, no, no!
[01:37:05.100 --> 01:37:06.921]  I want to go to your calls.
[01:37:06.921 --> 01:37:07.841]  I had misread the sheet.
[01:37:07.841 --> 01:37:09.221]  I thought Powell was on for an hour.
[01:37:09.221 --> 01:37:12.022]  He had to go, but we do have Mr. Dent joining us.
[01:37:12.022 --> 01:37:16.443]  He made specific predictions about the stock market situation coming up.
[01:37:16.443 --> 01:37:28.107]  Jay Johnson, the head of Homeland Security, is up there giving speeches about imminent cyber attacks and how we need to pass government takeover of the Internet and a handover of that.
[01:37:28.107 --> 01:37:32.068]  That's happening right now on C-SPAN.
[01:37:33.502 --> 01:37:43.636]  And then separately, we've got the cyber security stocks all racing up on the NASDAQ after the stock market was closed.
[01:37:43.636 --> 01:37:48.483]  Cyber security stocks surged on the back of big New York Stock Exchange trading halt.
[01:37:48.483 --> 01:37:50.165]  I'm not saying this was a cyber attack.
[01:37:50.970 --> 01:37:52.351]  But it's very suspicious.
[01:37:52.351 --> 01:37:56.052]  Either a cyber attack or they halted trading to stop a route.
[01:37:56.052 --> 01:38:02.595]  It's probably halted trading to stop a route and are just fear-mongering on the back of it, implying it could be a cyber attack.
[01:38:02.595 --> 01:38:05.796]  That's probably what went on here.
[01:38:05.796 --> 01:38:08.157]  But United Airlines got taken down today.
[01:38:08.157 --> 01:38:09.798]  The Wall Street Journal had an issue today.
[01:38:09.798 --> 01:38:11.619]  Let's put that up there.
[01:38:11.619 --> 01:38:15.901]  Wall Street Journal homepage is down as NASDAQ stops trading.
[01:38:15.901 --> 01:38:18.322]  I mean, there's a bunch of weirdness going on right now.
[01:38:19.383 --> 01:38:29.971]  There is a whole bunch of weirdness going on and happening and taking place right now, as Chinese stocks are now down more than 40%.
[01:38:29.971 --> 01:38:33.294]  We'll give you the latest here in a moment.
[01:38:33.294 --> 01:38:36.957]  Now, I want to give this Leanne McAdoo report.
[01:38:36.957 --> 01:38:38.758]  Again, this is two days ago in Austin.
[01:38:38.758 --> 01:38:41.320]  This is her on the Nightly News Monday.
[01:38:41.320 --> 01:38:46.244]  And she went out and was trying to ask people, hey, do you think a stock collapse could come here?
[01:38:51.169 --> 01:39:09.515]  As usual they don't really most of them answer a question they just go off some of them into blaming the Greeks when I bet bottom dollar if you didn't label the Greek Isles on a map on a world map on a globe I bet you they couldn't find it I bet you all the money
[01:39:11.445 --> 01:39:13.227]  What do you think about what's going on in Greece?
[01:39:13.227 --> 01:39:15.290]  Do you think something like that could happen here?
[01:39:28.595 --> 01:39:29.315]  Well, of course.
[01:39:29.315 --> 01:39:30.856]  It's happening in Puerto Rico.
[01:39:30.856 --> 01:39:32.457]  That's kind of here.
[01:39:32.457 --> 01:39:32.697]  Yeah.
[01:39:32.697 --> 01:39:33.958]  So, yeah, absolutely.
[01:39:33.958 --> 01:39:34.438]  Absolutely.
[01:39:34.438 --> 01:39:40.561]  I mean, especially with the IMF, the way they handle things, I think it's very possible.
[01:39:40.561 --> 01:39:46.124]  How would you feel if the banks were shut down here for a week and you could only take out about $60 a day?
[01:39:46.124 --> 01:39:48.326]  I think most people would be panicked.
[01:39:48.326 --> 01:39:51.707]  I would try to plan for something like that.
[01:39:51.707 --> 01:39:54.689]  But I think a lot of people would panic.
[01:39:54.689 --> 01:39:55.770]  I'd be pissed off.
[01:39:55.770 --> 01:39:57.210]  That is a very good question.
[01:39:57.210 --> 01:39:57.911]  What would we all do?
[01:39:58.351 --> 01:40:04.094]  How would your business survive or thrive if people weren't able to get cash out of the bank?
[01:40:04.094 --> 01:40:12.958]  Well, I personally think that it's a real tragedy that you would have a country that would go bankrupt that once had money and now don't have any money.
[01:40:12.958 --> 01:40:15.799]  But a business like mine would just die there.
[01:40:15.799 --> 01:40:22.142]  And bless her heart, we're a generous people and we want to make sure that our citizens are happy.
[01:40:22.142 --> 01:40:24.764]  But there's a warning out there someplace that
[01:40:25.544 --> 01:40:32.786]  You know, there is a limit on how much money you can borrow and still pay it back on time.
[01:40:32.786 --> 01:40:33.647]  Right.
[01:40:33.647 --> 01:40:37.468]  And as far as I know, you can't borrow money without paying interest on it.
[01:40:37.468 --> 01:40:37.908]  Yeah, boss.
[01:40:37.908 --> 01:40:42.129]  Well, unless you're a bank, they're going to... I love that, but back it up.
[01:40:42.129 --> 01:40:45.270]  This guy's in his fancy suit.
[01:40:45.270 --> 01:40:48.911]  And he's going, we're nice to our citizens, but there's a limit on what we can give them.
[01:40:48.911 --> 01:40:51.112]  The Greeks didn't get to vote to join the Euro.
[01:40:51.112 --> 01:40:53.613]  The Euro was designed to predatorily come in and take over.
[01:40:54.656 --> 01:40:58.778]  Greece bailed out the Euro and now that's their debt.
[01:40:58.778 --> 01:41:03.821]  So you don't bail out the mega banks and then you're out of debt.
[01:41:03.821 --> 01:41:07.183]  You're in debt and they're not.
[01:41:07.183 --> 01:41:16.148]  Then they have the financial shows bad mouth you and convince people like this fellow that you're somehow a bad person.
[01:41:16.148 --> 01:41:20.171]  And yes they socialize things so people are dependent on the state so that things are
[01:41:21.314 --> 01:41:30.268]  Communalized in a collective system so people will stick with the system even as it's designed to bring them down because they're invested in it.
[01:41:30.268 --> 01:41:32.531]  I mean, corporate welfare is the majority of welfare.
[01:41:33.615 --> 01:41:38.636]  And I love the fake conservatives that are always up there going, oh yeah, it's all these lazy people.
[01:41:38.636 --> 01:41:40.517]  That's why we've got a banking crisis.
[01:41:40.517 --> 01:41:53.200]  We have a banking crisis because they created fake derivatives by the thousands of trillions of dollars and got the municipal, county, city, state, federal, international groups to invest in them.
[01:41:53.200 --> 01:41:57.601]  It's the fiat fraud is why we're in so much trouble.
[01:41:57.601 --> 01:42:01.062]  The socialism's bad, but that's to keep you on the hook and get you dependent.
[01:42:02.020 --> 01:42:05.222]  It's only part of the problem, not the big enchilada.
[01:42:05.222 --> 01:42:06.643]  That's why I'm against it.
[01:42:06.643 --> 01:42:09.525]  But it's not the scapegoat.
[01:42:09.525 --> 01:42:11.966]  Let's go ahead, but I love people that aren't part of the system.
[01:42:11.966 --> 01:42:13.167]  Always act like they're a power trip.
[01:42:13.167 --> 01:42:23.393]  Well, we've given them so much, and now they're just lazy, like you're part of the establishment, because you're wearing a Orville Redenbacher outfit.
[01:42:23.393 --> 01:42:24.154]  Let's go back to him.
[01:42:24.679 --> 01:42:31.023]  And bless her heart, we're a generous people and we want to make sure that our citizens are happy.
[01:42:31.023 --> 01:42:42.530]  But there's a warning out there someplace that, you know, there is a limit on how much money you can borrow and still pay it back on time.
[01:42:42.530 --> 01:42:46.273]  And as far as I know, you can't borrow money without paying interest on it.
[01:42:47.153 --> 01:42:48.354]  Well, unless you're a bank.
[01:42:48.354 --> 01:42:57.239]  They're going to start looking at ways to kind of pay the banks, keep them solvent, which will be taking 30% a little haircut out of people's savings accounts.
[01:42:57.239 --> 01:43:01.021]  Anyone who has about 8,000 euros in their account.
[01:43:01.021 --> 01:43:03.842]  Would you be okay giving a little haircut to the banks?
[01:43:03.842 --> 01:43:07.004]  It doesn't sound right, because that's the money that I've saved.
[01:43:07.004 --> 01:43:08.145]  I don't have a savings account.
[01:43:09.045 --> 01:43:10.686]  I keep my money at home.
[01:43:10.686 --> 01:43:19.769]  Would you be okay pushing back your retirement so that the banks could get paid even though it was the banks that were doing the risky trading and everything?
[01:43:19.769 --> 01:43:26.092]  I wouldn't have a whole lot to give, but whatever they take, I wouldn't be very cool about.
[01:43:26.092 --> 01:43:28.853]  Back it up and get a look on that guy's face.
[01:43:28.853 --> 01:43:30.894]  Because here he is.
[01:43:30.894 --> 01:43:33.455]  This doesn't fit the narrative of CNN and Fox News.
[01:43:34.582 --> 01:43:36.703]  Where she's like, but it's the megabanks that got the trillions.
[01:43:36.703 --> 01:43:38.343]  They're the ones that don't have to pay interest.
[01:43:38.343 --> 01:43:42.905]  They're the ones that can leverage at 10 to 1 fractional reserve and beyond that with derivatives.
[01:43:42.905 --> 01:43:44.045]  And he's like, who?
[01:43:44.045 --> 01:43:58.510]  Because see, it was all about him feeling powerful over her and him just guessing she's a dumb liberal because she's a woman and lecturing her when the truth is, I talked to major executives and CEOs, they can't find their butts with both hands.
[01:43:59.190 --> 01:44:02.754]  They know their little market, their little company, their little trend.
[01:44:02.754 --> 01:44:04.616]  They don't have general knowledge.
[01:44:04.616 --> 01:44:07.480]  And I'm not up here glad that you're so ignorant.
[01:44:07.480 --> 01:44:10.844]  But the so-called smart people are some of the dumbest ones around.
[01:44:10.844 --> 01:44:12.305]  Let's go back to it.
[01:44:12.305 --> 01:44:19.674]  Would you be okay pushing back your retirement so that the banks could get paid even though it was the banks that were doing the risky trading and everything?
[01:44:21.389 --> 01:44:27.231]  I wouldn't have a whole lot to give, but whatever they take, I wouldn't be very cool about it.
[01:44:27.231 --> 01:44:28.512]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:44:28.512 --> 01:44:31.393]  They might need to take some austerity measures.
[01:44:31.393 --> 01:44:33.514]  Which ones and at what level?
[01:44:33.514 --> 01:44:35.194]  It's way beyond me to know.
[01:44:35.194 --> 01:44:40.556]  Do you think that the Greek people are just greedy because they're just addicted to all this welfare that's been coming their way?
[01:44:40.556 --> 01:44:43.017]  Or do you think it's the banks that are being greedy?
[01:44:43.017 --> 01:44:46.559]  Well, if the Greek people are countries who are controlled
[01:44:47.583 --> 01:44:49.624]  I call it aristocracy, not a democracy.
[01:44:49.624 --> 01:44:51.964]  That's owned by the bank.
[01:44:51.964 --> 01:44:54.085]  So, they don't really have any options.
[01:44:54.085 --> 01:44:59.286]  I don't know that much about it, but I know if you're borrowing money, you ought to pay it back.
[01:44:59.286 --> 01:45:05.828]  Do you give one of our 50 states a credit card and they default on it, so the rest of the states have to suffer it?
[01:45:05.828 --> 01:45:07.369]  I think we should leave them on their own.
[01:45:07.369 --> 01:45:08.109]  They've been spending
[01:45:09.029 --> 01:45:17.696]  Recklessly for years and now it's, uh... I tend to err on the side of kindness and let's help a brother out, but this is not the first time I've been in this situation either.
[01:45:17.696 --> 01:45:23.921]  It wasn't actually the Greeks taking... Who borrowed the money and who got the benefit of the borrowed money?
[01:45:23.921 --> 01:45:30.546]  It's the people with the pension, the government employees, all benefited from that borrowed money.
[01:45:30.546 --> 01:45:33.228]  That's how they got paid what they got.
[01:45:33.228 --> 01:45:35.269]  That's how they got the pensions they got.
[01:45:35.269 --> 01:45:35.910]  That's how they get your money.
[01:45:36.230 --> 01:45:40.453]  So they are the benefactors of the board money.
[01:45:40.453 --> 01:45:42.855]  A bailout might bring restrictions that they don't want.
[01:45:42.855 --> 01:45:45.716]  It's going to be back in the same position they were.
[01:45:45.716 --> 01:45:51.840]  But on the other hand, if it causes the entire world stage to start to fall, yeah.
[01:45:53.916 --> 01:45:55.718]  Is it best for them?
[01:45:55.718 --> 01:45:56.579]  Maybe not.
[01:45:56.579 --> 01:45:59.603]  The government borrowed the money on their behalf.
[01:45:59.603 --> 01:46:02.005]  They were the beneficiaries.
[01:46:02.005 --> 01:46:06.089]  You can't borrow money and get all the advantages of that borrowed money.
[01:46:07.637 --> 01:46:09.397]  And not pay it back.
[01:46:09.397 --> 01:46:14.179]  So you're telling me that you can make me hungry, but the government is okay because they own the company.
[01:46:14.179 --> 01:46:15.119]  Well, that's not right.
[01:46:15.119 --> 01:46:15.539]  Yeah.
[01:46:15.539 --> 01:46:17.019]  That's communism.
[01:46:17.019 --> 01:46:20.420]  They do not get a free lunch.
[01:46:20.420 --> 01:46:24.101]  I couldn't figure out how they would allow themselves to go bankrupt because they would go broke.
[01:46:24.101 --> 01:46:28.062]  And usually they're too greedy to go broke, but I can go broke if somebody else is paying for it.
[01:46:28.062 --> 01:46:32.103]  There will be some pain involved.
[01:46:36.590 --> 01:46:38.931]  Yeah, that's that guy that's going to have some pain.
[01:46:38.931 --> 01:46:43.532]  Another arrogant know-it-all pseudo-intellectual makes me want to throw up.
[01:46:43.532 --> 01:46:52.135]  Let me explain this to Orville Redenbacher wearing his pre-1929 outfit, his dandy outfit.
[01:46:52.135 --> 01:46:56.876]  I think it's fitting that he's wearing a Depression-era get-up.
[01:46:59.676 --> 01:47:07.082]  Maybe 20% of the blame goes on the Greek government and the socialists being set up and wanting some goodies and wanting to live outside their means.
[01:47:07.082 --> 01:47:08.884]  The general public doesn't owe it.
[01:47:08.884 --> 01:47:20.934]  You don't come right into people's bank accounts and have foreign international banks threaten to cut off food being shipped in that you're going to pay for if you default on the Euro plan.
[01:47:20.934 --> 01:47:22.896]  The Euro and the United States
[01:47:24.113 --> 01:47:29.437]  Collectively are more than two-thirds of the 2.2 quadrillion in derivatives.
[01:47:29.437 --> 01:47:48.169]  2008, and these nations going into debt, here and in Europe, most of the debt, over 70%, was just in the bailouts alone, where trillions of dollars was given to prop up the banks that now sit here lecturing us.
[01:47:50.356 --> 01:47:57.862]  And boy, she got his attention when she said, well, should they take some of the money out of your bank account to prop this up?
[01:47:57.862 --> 01:48:00.924]  And he goes, there may need to be some austerity measures.
[01:48:00.924 --> 01:48:04.587]  And then later he's going, there's going to be some pain for Greece.
[01:48:04.587 --> 01:48:07.970]  And he just smiles and gets off on it.
[01:48:07.970 --> 01:48:10.372]  And that guy's probably got like 20 people that work for him.
[01:48:10.372 --> 01:48:12.994]  And I've run into these folks, the opposite of capitalism.
[01:48:12.994 --> 01:48:17.598]  They just get off on their petty power and then imagine they're part of the New World Order.
[01:48:18.626 --> 01:48:26.889]  Because, you know, they go to a dinner once a year with 50 people and eat with a senator, or they know George Bush, or they know Hillary Clinton.
[01:48:26.889 --> 01:48:33.751]  I mean, it's... I would have loved to address that guy down, but Leanne did a superlative job.
[01:48:33.751 --> 01:48:37.372]  Absolutely fantastic job.
[01:48:37.372 --> 01:48:40.953]  Coming up, we've got a John Bowne report, we've got a Jakari Jackson report that are excellent.
[01:48:40.953 --> 01:48:43.274]  In the next segment, I want to play this clip.
[01:48:44.096 --> 01:48:46.158]  That is epic.
[01:48:46.158 --> 01:48:59.913]  With Nigel Farage, the Ron Paul of Europe, in the EU Parliament, speaking to the Prime Minister of Greece, saying to him, you need to leave the Euro, you need to engage in leadership.
[01:48:59.913 --> 01:49:01.475]  Farage rocks EU Parliament.
[01:49:02.844 --> 01:49:06.705]  Tells the Greek leader, leave the Euro, reclaim your democracy.
[01:49:06.705 --> 01:49:11.887]  And again, using that term that's real sexy in England and Europe, you know, democracy.
[01:49:11.887 --> 01:49:16.068]  This would be a pure democracy and sometimes it acts in a good way to leave.
[01:49:16.068 --> 01:49:21.870]  But I just say do it under basic common sense and sovereignty.
[01:49:26.459 --> 01:49:35.765]  But the truth is, look at how our computers and our software are now globalist run, and how they had to shut the stock market down because the computers were dumping.
[01:49:35.765 --> 01:49:38.306]  We're run by Skynet here.
[01:49:38.306 --> 01:49:43.610]  Okay, and then I know I said I was going to have calls for Pallas, but I forgot he had to go.
[01:49:43.610 --> 01:49:48.112]  These callers, you'll be there, you get to talk to Dent or myself, I'm going to get to you.
[01:49:48.112 --> 01:49:51.775]  Walt and Truth and Gerald and Carl and Brandon and others, I'm going to go to you.
[01:49:53.051 --> 01:49:58.957]  Briefly, a lot of exciting news at InfoWarsTore.com, one of the main funding mechanisms of this media operation.

[01:50:19.497 --> 01:50:24.759]  We have 10% off all t-shirts, including the Made in America t-shirts, and free shipping.
[01:50:24.759 --> 01:50:30.841]  And then of course, we have sold out of Brain Force, Liver Shield, Prostagard, Child Ease, Occupower.
[01:50:30.841 --> 01:50:37.583]  Survival Shield is selling out soon, so is Refill Vitality selling out soon, Oxy Powder is selling out soon.
[01:50:37.583 --> 01:50:41.064]  The B12, Silver Bullet, Oregano Oil, Organic.

[01:50:47.931 --> 01:50:49.352]  Life changer for me, the X2.
[01:50:49.352 --> 01:50:50.553]  I mean, just life changer.
[01:50:59.500 --> 01:51:03.624]  Communist China freely allows the sale of bulletproof armor plates, while our U.S.
[01:51:03.624 --> 01:51:06.786]  politicians argue from banning Americans from owning body armor.
[01:51:06.786 --> 01:51:08.428]  Does that sound right to you?

[01:51:33.299 --> 01:51:34.940]  Are tax debts crippling you?
[01:51:34.940 --> 01:51:37.762]  I've defended people from the IRS for over 30 years.
[01:51:37.762 --> 01:51:40.064]  I've helped thousands and I can help you too.
[01:51:40.064 --> 01:51:44.567]  I wrote the book on IRS settlement and I'm telling you there's no such thing as a hopeless case.

[01:51:59.924 --> 01:52:07.130]  For all of recorded history, civilizations around the world praised the health benefits of silver.

[01:52:57.515 --> 01:53:01.357]  Honey, it's time for dinner.
[01:53:01.357 --> 01:53:03.238]  What are you doing over there on your computer?
[01:53:03.238 --> 01:53:04.719]  I'm shopping for a new wallet.
[01:53:04.719 --> 01:53:06.260]  Mine is falling apart.
[01:53:06.260 --> 01:53:12.443]  Hey, did you know there's a company called ID Stronghold that makes shielded wallets to prevent electronic pickpocketing?
[01:53:12.443 --> 01:53:15.645]  Oh, I didn't realize there was such a thing as electronic pickpocketing.
[01:53:15.645 --> 01:53:16.185]  What is that?
[01:53:16.485 --> 01:53:26.027]  Well, apparently many of the new credit and debit cards being issued have radio chips inside them called RFID to transmit our banking information to card readers when we pay.
[01:53:26.027 --> 01:53:34.729]  Unfortunately, a bad guy can also get one of these readers and go around the city scanning people, collecting their credit card numbers and personal information without us knowing it.
[01:53:34.729 --> 01:53:35.369]  Wow!
[01:53:35.369 --> 01:53:36.689]  That sounds scary.
[01:53:36.689 --> 01:53:41.130]  Since you're getting a new wallet anyway, you should definitely get an ID Stronghold shielded wallet.
[01:53:41.130 --> 01:53:41.950]  Are they more expensive?
[01:53:42.390 --> 01:53:42.911]  No.
[01:53:42.911 --> 01:53:50.597]  In fact, I can get a shielded leather wallet from IDStronghold.com for the same price or less than regular unshielded wallets from other stores.
[01:53:50.597 --> 01:53:51.778]  Sounds great!
[01:53:51.778 --> 01:53:54.420]  My wallet isn't falling apart yet, but let me pick one out too.
[01:53:54.420 --> 01:53:58.483]  I want to be protected, and these wallets at IDStronghold.com look fantastic!
[01:54:08.777 --> 01:54:11.138]  Some of the news up on InfoWars.com.
[01:54:11.138 --> 01:54:15.120]  CEO suggests NASDAQ shutdown as a cyber attack.
[01:54:15.120 --> 01:54:19.642]  Students disenfranchise Democrats going for Socialist Sanders.
[01:54:19.642 --> 01:54:24.804]  Chinese stocks collapse right before NASDAQ or New York Stock Exchange shutdown.
[01:54:24.804 --> 01:54:35.489]  Nigel Farage rocks EU Parliament, tells leader of Greece, leave the Euro, reclaim your democracy in front of outraged EU bureaucrats and more.
[01:54:36.289 --> 01:54:44.972]  In fact, speaking of Nigel Farage, the leader of the libertarian movement in Europe, here is an excerpt of that powerful speech yesterday.
[01:54:44.972 --> 01:54:47.393]  Now Mr. Farage for the FD Group.
[01:54:47.393 --> 01:54:47.754]  Thank you.
[01:54:47.754 --> 01:54:56.897]  What we're seeing in this chamber this morning, and indeed across the whole of Europe, is an irreconcilable cultural difference between Greece and Germany.
[01:54:56.897 --> 01:55:00.639]  A split between the North and the South of Europe.
[01:55:00.639 --> 01:55:03.940]  Europe, the European project, is actually beginning to die.
[01:55:04.480 --> 01:55:12.791]  Nobody in this room will recognise that, but actually the peoples of Europe are saying we were never asked whether we wanted this.
[01:55:12.791 --> 01:55:15.274]  This has been foisted upon us.
[01:55:15.274 --> 01:55:19.400]  And we need to understand why EMU doesn't work.
[01:55:19.400 --> 01:55:21.282]  Those monsters, Coal and Mitterrand,
[01:55:21.883 --> 01:55:24.704]  Backed up with a clever but dangerous delore.
[01:55:24.704 --> 01:55:33.689]  Believed that if they put in place an economic and monetary union, then as night follows day, there would be political union.
[01:55:33.689 --> 01:55:36.190]  That there would be an acceptance of this project.
[01:55:36.190 --> 01:55:39.472]  That the North and South of Europe would converge.
[01:55:39.472 --> 01:55:41.813]  That we'd all start to love each other.
[01:55:42.173 --> 01:55:45.335]  That we'd all begin to feel a European identity.
[01:55:45.335 --> 01:55:49.598]  That we'd all begin to show allegiance to the flag and the anthem.
[01:55:49.598 --> 01:55:56.363]  Those of us, of course, that criticise this were told that we were extremists and we lacked vision.
[01:55:56.363 --> 01:56:02.367]  Well, one vision we didn't lack is we understood that the countries of Europe are different.
[01:56:02.367 --> 01:56:11.893]  And that if you try and force together different people or different economies without first seeking the consent of those people, it is unlikely to work.
[01:56:12.373 --> 01:56:15.375]  And the plan has failed.
[01:56:15.375 --> 01:56:17.357]  This isn't just Greece we're talking about today.
[01:56:17.357 --> 01:56:22.980]  The whole of the Mediterranean now finds itself in the wrong currency.
[01:56:22.980 --> 01:56:28.424]  And yet virtually nobody in the political arena has got the courage to stand up and say that.
[01:56:28.424 --> 01:56:33.127]  Indeed I feel that the continent is now divided from north to south.
[01:56:33.127 --> 01:56:36.309]  There is a new Berlin Wall and it's called the Euro.
[01:56:37.230 --> 01:56:40.553]  And the old enmities have been resumed.
[01:56:40.553 --> 01:56:47.439]  Just listen to the way that the German leader of the Christian Democrat group this morning attacked Mr Spiras.
[01:56:47.439 --> 01:56:55.826]  I think it was absolutely disgusting, but it shows the way, it shows the way North and South now feel about each other.
[01:56:55.826 --> 01:57:01.671]  Mr Tsipras, your country should never have joined the Euro, I think you acknowledge that, but the big banks
[01:57:02.011 --> 01:57:05.173]  The big businesses and big politics forced you in.
[01:57:05.173 --> 01:57:09.175]  Goldman Sachs, the German arms manufacturers, they were all very happy.
[01:57:09.175 --> 01:57:12.657]  And when the bailouts began, they weren't for the Greek people.
[01:57:12.657 --> 01:57:17.100]  Those bailouts were the bailout French, German and Italian banks.
[01:57:17.100 --> 01:57:17.380]  That's right.
[01:57:17.380 --> 01:57:18.381]  They haven't helped you at all.
[01:57:19.501 --> 01:57:26.487]  And these years of austerity, these years of high unemployment, of increasing poverty, none of it's worked.
[01:57:26.487 --> 01:57:34.813]  In fact, your debt-GDP ratio has gone from 100% at the start of the crisis to 180% right now.
[01:57:34.813 --> 01:57:38.315]  It would be madness, sir, to continue on this course.
[01:57:38.315 --> 01:57:39.937]  You have been very brave.
[01:57:39.937 --> 01:57:44.160]  You called that referendum when one of your predecessors tried to do the same.
[01:57:44.160 --> 01:57:46.702]  The bully boys of Brussels had him removed.
[01:57:47.342 --> 01:57:48.524]  They tried their best again.
[01:57:48.524 --> 01:57:52.789]  Mr Juncker said you would have to leave the Euro and leave the European Union.
[01:57:52.789 --> 01:58:01.919]  Even Mr Schultz, the President of the Parliament, who one would have thought might be neutral, said that if the Greeks voted no, their power supplies may even go down.
[01:58:01.919 --> 01:58:04.542]  There were threats and bullying, but the Greeks stood firm.
[01:58:05.503 --> 01:58:08.864]  But sir, you cannot have your cake and eat it.
[01:58:08.864 --> 01:58:10.965]  They will give you no more, these people.
[01:58:10.965 --> 01:58:12.725]  They can't afford to.
[01:58:12.725 --> 01:58:16.247]  If they give you more, they'll have to give other Eurozone members more.
[01:58:16.247 --> 01:58:17.687]  So your moment has come.
[01:58:17.687 --> 01:58:25.610]  And frankly, if you've got the courage, you should lead the Greek people out of the Eurozone with your head held high.
[01:58:25.610 --> 01:58:27.831]  Get back your democracy.
[01:58:27.831 --> 01:58:30.432]  Get back control of your country.
[01:58:30.432 --> 01:58:31.332]  Give your people
[01:58:32.012 --> 01:58:35.955]  Give your people the leadership and the hope that they crave.
[01:58:35.955 --> 01:58:40.017]  Yes, it'll be tough for the first few months.
[01:58:40.017 --> 01:58:40.557]  We'll be back.
[01:58:40.557 --> 01:58:43.299]  Stay with us for the key ending part.
[01:58:43.299 --> 01:58:45.540]  He breaks down a plan which will work.
[01:58:45.540 --> 01:58:47.942]  Globalism destroys.
[01:58:49.028 --> 01:59:08.770]  Ladies and gentlemen, you haven't really ever heard firearms manufacturers as sponsors on my syndicated radio show, or the nightly news, or the news website, InfoWars.com, because the companies I've been approached by were not the highest quality, and they weren't as affordable as they should be, so I refused probably 30, 40 firearms manufacturers over the years.
[01:59:08.770 --> 01:59:09.191]  Well then,
[01:59:09.531 --> 01:59:13.436]  About six months ago, we get contacted by Head Down Firearms.
[01:59:13.436 --> 01:59:15.137]  hdfirearms.com.
[01:59:15.137 --> 01:59:18.441]  Owned and run by a bunch of former Navy SEALs, Special Ops people.
[01:59:18.441 --> 01:59:23.567]  They're veterans, they're patriots, they're listeners of the radio show, and they want to support the broadcast.
[01:59:23.567 --> 01:59:24.428]  It's always about security.
[01:59:24.428 --> 01:59:24.788]  I think so.
[01:59:51.563 --> 01:59:54.177]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:05.086 --> 02:00:09.908]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:00:09.908 --> 02:00:11.489]  You want answers?
[02:00:11.489 --> 02:00:13.050]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.050 --> 02:00:17.232]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.232 --> 02:00:22.254]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:22.254 --> 02:00:32.039]  Here's the last minute of the powerful speech in the EU Parliament with the leader of UKIP telling the leader of Greece
[02:00:34.504 --> 02:00:36.165]  You can't have your cake and eat it too.
[02:00:36.165 --> 02:00:38.947]  You must leave the Euro.
[02:00:38.947 --> 02:00:40.268]  You will be destroyed by it.
[02:00:40.268 --> 02:00:42.730]  It's going to be tough, but it's the only way.
[02:00:42.730 --> 02:00:44.191]  Nigel Farage.
[02:00:44.191 --> 02:00:53.317]  Even Mr. Schultz, the President of the Parliament, who one would have thought might be neutral, said that if the Greeks voted no, their power supplies may even go down.
[02:00:53.317 --> 02:00:55.959]  There were threats and bullying, but the Greeks stood firm.
[02:00:56.920 --> 02:00:57.640]  Enough, sir.
[02:00:57.640 --> 02:01:00.281]  You cannot have your cake and eat it.
[02:01:00.281 --> 02:01:02.381]  They will give you no more, these people.
[02:01:02.381 --> 02:01:04.142]  They can't afford to.
[02:01:04.142 --> 02:01:07.662]  If they give you more, they'll have to give other Eurozone members more.
[02:01:07.662 --> 02:01:09.103]  So your moment has come.
[02:01:09.103 --> 02:01:17.025]  And frankly, if you've got the courage, you should lead the Greek people out of the Eurozone with your head held high.
[02:01:17.025 --> 02:01:19.245]  Get back your democracy.
[02:01:19.245 --> 02:01:21.846]  Get back control of your country.
[02:01:21.846 --> 02:01:22.446]  Give your people
[02:01:23.446 --> 02:01:27.369]  Give your people the leadership and the hope that they crave.
[02:01:27.369 --> 02:01:35.855]  Yes, it'll be tough for the first few months, but with a devalued currency and with friends of Greece all over the world, you will recover.
[02:01:43.991 --> 02:01:47.992]  And of course the Prime Minister, leader of Greece, does not look happy during any of that.
[02:01:47.992 --> 02:01:49.372]  This is very serious.
[02:01:49.372 --> 02:01:56.474]  They're threatening a coup, even military internal takeovers in Greece.
[02:01:56.474 --> 02:02:03.756]  It's a very dangerous situation because it affects the entire Euro and the whole world as China begins to go belly up.
[02:02:05.461 --> 02:02:15.449]  I mean, China has thousands of riots per month, incredible corruption, with the Communist Party people three generations deep now, since 49.
[02:02:15.449 --> 02:02:17.531]  Their kids don't even work.
[02:02:17.531 --> 02:02:20.233]  Most generals are billionaires.
[02:02:20.233 --> 02:02:30.461]  Imagine, you're a general because your grandfather was a general, and it's a bunch of Kim Jong-uns running around, just insane asylum-level rich, saying they're communist.
[02:02:30.461 --> 02:02:31.642]  I mean, it's just a joke!
[02:02:32.745 --> 02:02:41.072]  Totalitarianism, whether it's fascism or communism, doesn't work because it's not meant to work.
[02:02:41.072 --> 02:02:47.858]  You give powerful government control over an economy, the people in the government will become kings overnight.
[02:02:47.858 --> 02:02:57.106]  The only way to have freedom is diverse distribution of power through the vote of the dollar, through the vote of free association,
[02:02:58.840 --> 02:03:06.125]  Build the world according to performance and review and free association.
[02:03:06.125 --> 02:03:09.887]  People who don't know history haven't traveled the world that sit around bitching about America.
[02:03:09.887 --> 02:03:11.609]  I mean, you're idiots!
[02:03:11.609 --> 02:03:13.910]  You're morons!
[02:03:13.910 --> 02:03:15.051]  They talk about dangerous.
[02:03:15.051 --> 02:03:17.412]  Rand Paul is a real deal.
[02:03:17.412 --> 02:03:19.254]  I don't know about other people up there.
[02:03:19.254 --> 02:03:22.676]  I like some of the stuff Cruz does, but I just don't know him.
[02:03:22.676 --> 02:03:24.057]  Rand Paul is the real deal.
[02:03:25.706 --> 02:03:28.711]  And he has come out against Hillary, which is very, very dangerous.
[02:03:28.711 --> 02:03:32.077]  I mean, the Clintons will blow you up in an airplane.
[02:03:32.077 --> 02:03:33.739]  I mean, they're murdering mafia scum.
[02:03:33.739 --> 02:03:34.581]  Let's check out this clip.
[02:03:35.134 --> 02:03:37.915]  I find it very hard to believe that Hillary Clinton didn't know.
[02:03:37.915 --> 02:03:44.396]  In fact, she was the biggest cheerleader for sending these arms and redistributing these arms into Syrian rebels.
[02:03:44.396 --> 02:03:50.878]  And the reason why this is an important issue, many of the people who receive these arms are not friends of America.
[02:03:50.878 --> 02:03:59.640]  Many of them are linked to al-Qaeda, al-Nusra, and some of these weapons may well have wound up in the hands of people who became ISIS.
[02:03:59.640 --> 02:04:01.281]  So this is no small fact.
[02:04:01.281 --> 02:04:02.761]  Whether or not she told the truth,
[02:04:03.201 --> 02:04:04.482]  Is a big deal.
[02:04:04.482 --> 02:04:12.207]  And some of the emails coming out about Benghazi indicate that maybe she did know a lot more about this arms trade than she let on.
[02:04:12.207 --> 02:04:17.250]  And I don't think our public officials should be allowed to come before congressional committees and lie.
[02:04:17.250 --> 02:04:27.776]  But it's also concerning because the big problem we face now with ISIS, did it have anything to do with Hillary Clinton arming people who either became ISIS or who were friends or allies of ISIS?
[02:04:27.776 --> 02:04:28.797]  You dropped the L word.
[02:04:28.797 --> 02:04:30.037]  Was she lying, Senator?
[02:04:30.037 --> 02:04:30.778]  Is that what you're saying?
[02:04:31.738 --> 02:04:39.645]  I think there's a very good chance, because I think there's no way that Hillary Clinton did not know about this, her private email, so that she was the one supporting arming these people.
[02:04:39.645 --> 02:04:40.005]  Yeah, of course.
[02:04:40.005 --> 02:04:40.486]  Here's the deal.
[02:04:40.486 --> 02:04:42.568]  Rand Paul knows a lot more than he's saying, obviously.
[02:04:42.568 --> 02:04:48.313]  He's the one, other than this show, that helped expose, with Tosh Plumley and others, what was really going on, Colonel Schaefer.
[02:04:48.313 --> 02:04:50.514]  And we need to pray for all these people, including me.
[02:04:50.514 --> 02:04:53.557]  I mean, I'm not saying I'm a hero here, I'm just doing my job.
[02:04:53.557 --> 02:04:55.539]  But let me tell you, this is dangerous.
[02:04:55.539 --> 02:04:56.720]  Don't take this for granted, folks.
[02:05:00.782 --> 02:05:13.791]  From bioweapons and genetic modification to autonomous killing machines and the surveillance state, engineers and scientists are busy creating technologies that could result in billions of people dying or living as slaves.
[02:05:13.791 --> 02:05:17.194]  Michael Crichton put it this way 25 years ago in Jurassic Park.
[02:05:18.342 --> 02:05:19.443]  They're technicians.
[02:05:19.443 --> 02:05:20.463]  They don't have intelligence.
[02:05:20.463 --> 02:05:23.185]  They have what I call thin intelligence.
[02:05:23.185 --> 02:05:25.567]  They see the immediate situation.
[02:05:25.567 --> 02:05:28.189]  They think narrowly and they call it being focused.
[02:05:28.189 --> 02:05:29.550]  They don't see the surround.
[02:05:29.550 --> 02:05:31.531]  They don't see the consequences.
[02:05:31.531 --> 02:05:34.453]  That's how you get an island like Jurassic Park.
[02:05:34.453 --> 02:05:36.714]  From thin, intelligent thinking.
[02:05:36.714 --> 02:05:39.656]  Because you can't make an animal and not expect it to act alive.
[02:05:39.656 --> 02:05:41.117]  To be unpredictable.
[02:05:41.117 --> 02:05:42.398]  To escape.
[02:05:42.398 --> 02:05:44.259]  But they don't see that.
[02:05:44.259 --> 02:05:46.541]  Ellie said, you want to turn back the clock?
[02:05:47.427 --> 02:05:49.331]  No, Malcolm said.
[02:05:49.331 --> 02:05:52.759]  I want people to wake up.
[02:05:52.759 --> 02:05:55.986]  So do I. For InfoWars.com, I'm David Knight.
[02:05:58.740 --> 02:06:15.393]  Ladies and gentlemen, you haven't really ever heard firearms manufacturers as sponsors on my syndicated radio show, or the nightly news, or the news website, InfoWars.com, because the companies I've been approached by were not the highest quality, and they weren't as affordable as they should be, so I refused.
[02:06:15.393 --> 02:06:18.896]  Probably 30, 40 firearms manufacturers over the years will then
[02:06:19.236 --> 02:06:23.137]  About six months ago, we get contacted by Head Down Firearms.
[02:06:23.137 --> 02:06:24.817]  Hdfirearms.com.

[02:07:11.095 --> 02:07:27.953]  We have rejected, literally, hundreds of products from the InfoWarsLife line because they are not of the very highest quality, or because they're not 100% organic, or because they don't pass all of the strictest toxicology tests there are that we have listed at InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:07:27.953 --> 02:07:31.557]  Whether it's Survival Shield Nascent Iodine, or DNA Force,

[02:07:38.340 --> 02:07:49.145]  I believe that all of these products will blow you away like they've done the thousands of other customers that have visited Infowarslife.com and believed in us and tried the products.

[02:08:21.415 --> 02:08:24.676]  Well, Harry Dent's been coming on with us for about five years.
[02:08:24.676 --> 02:08:29.979]  He's been a more frequent guest in the latest round of crises.
[02:08:29.979 --> 02:08:38.704]  He predicted years ago that China would probably be the trigger contagion for a global stock market, a meltdown that the bond market's ready to go.
[02:08:39.364 --> 02:08:42.088]  Ron Paul's been seconding what he has to say.
[02:08:42.088 --> 02:08:50.298]  So many other guests we have on have also been warning of this, but he specifically has been saying China's the big issue, not Greece.
[02:08:50.298 --> 02:08:52.060]  HarryDent.com.
[02:08:52.060 --> 02:08:56.185]  His new book is out, is already a bestseller, The Demographic Cliff.
[02:08:56.185 --> 02:08:57.226]  HarryDentResearch.com.
[02:08:58.968 --> 02:09:04.633]  Harryditt.com forward slash Alex Jones to find some really good deals on his book.
[02:09:04.633 --> 02:09:10.418]  But he joins us right now to give us his breakdown just for the next 30 minutes.
[02:09:10.418 --> 02:09:15.242]  Then I'm going to go to Walt, Carl, Gerald, Truth, Brandon and others that are patiently holding.
[02:09:15.242 --> 02:09:18.805]  In fact, you might get to talk to him if we have time.
[02:09:18.805 --> 02:09:22.328]  But I wanted to get him on because still the New York Stock Exchange is closed.
[02:09:23.489 --> 02:09:27.692]  Clearly the computers kicked in when there was a total plunge to turn it off.
[02:09:27.692 --> 02:09:28.933]  It's on record they do that.
[02:09:28.933 --> 02:09:33.356]  They're lying, saying that it was just a glitch.
[02:09:33.356 --> 02:09:36.798]  Normally when they have a stock holiday, a market holiday, they just admit it.
[02:09:36.798 --> 02:09:39.700]  This is part of the new wall of deception.
[02:09:39.700 --> 02:09:41.581]  Now they're saying it could be a cyber attack.
[02:09:41.581 --> 02:09:44.203]  That article's on InfoWars.com.
[02:09:44.203 --> 02:09:45.623]  I don't really buy that.
[02:09:46.624 --> 02:09:47.404]  We're good to go.
[02:10:07.854 --> 02:10:14.683]  And we have Obama with Obamacare that's just designed to stall the economy.
[02:10:14.683 --> 02:10:16.885]  You've got attempts to start wars with Russia.
[02:10:16.885 --> 02:10:19.408]  You've got all this saber-rattling with China.
[02:10:19.408 --> 02:10:26.577]  My concern, historically, with demographics, Dent can compare, correct me if I'm wrong, because he goes off a bunch of different spectrums.
[02:10:28.058 --> 02:10:32.800]  And different indicators, gauges, that war comes next.
[02:10:32.800 --> 02:10:38.763]  So we'll get his breakdown, former one of the top analysts and guys over at Bain Capital.
[02:10:38.763 --> 02:10:46.506]  I won't go over his whole background or bio, but he joins us right now, harrydentresearch.com or harrydent.com.
[02:10:46.506 --> 02:10:52.349]  Wow, Harry, well you called it over and over again for how many years that it would be China?
[02:10:52.349 --> 02:10:55.891]  And I think this signals, maybe I'm wrong, the beginning of
[02:10:57.171 --> 02:10:59.812]  Massive correction that you've been warning of.
[02:10:59.812 --> 02:11:02.994]  So, speak about China, what you think's going on with the U.S.
[02:11:02.994 --> 02:11:06.196]  stock market, the New York Stock Exchange being closed.
[02:11:06.196 --> 02:11:06.936]  Do you agree with me?
[02:11:06.936 --> 02:11:08.497]  Do you have any intel?
[02:11:08.497 --> 02:11:10.818]  And then, what's the next shoe to drop?
[02:11:12.031 --> 02:11:16.914]  Well, you know, China led the last breakdown in late 2007-2008.
[02:11:16.914 --> 02:11:18.035]  It was ahead of the U.S.
[02:11:18.035 --> 02:11:30.003]  markets, and we've also been warning people, Alex, that you've got to get out of these bubbles early because the first crash is typically 30 to 40% within a month or two, and people don't have time to get out.
[02:11:30.003 --> 02:11:31.804]  They say, well, I'll get out when it starts to weaken.
[02:11:31.804 --> 02:11:37.868]  No, it's too late when it happens in a bubble like this, and there's going to be a round of things we've got to look for.
[02:11:37.868 --> 02:11:40.430]  I think the Chinese market will probably bounce pretty soon.
[02:11:40.430 --> 02:11:41.731]  They're doing some pathetic.
[02:11:41.971 --> 02:11:42.371]  Yes, we are.
[02:11:58.638 --> 02:12:00.519]  We're good to go.
[02:12:20.888 --> 02:12:23.671]  Puerto Rico's next, then Portugal.
[02:12:23.671 --> 02:12:35.121]  Chicago and Illinois are in trouble, but I've been warning on this show that the first real critical thing to happen and watch for in the United States is oil drops again, and it's already dropped from 62 to 51 bucks in a few weeks.
[02:12:37.154 --> 02:12:38.396]  I know a bunch of people.
[02:12:53.533 --> 02:12:57.397]  that are in the oil industry, low-level, mid-level, small company owners.
[02:12:57.397 --> 02:13:01.941]  They're all fighting bankruptcy, are going bankrupt as we speak.
[02:13:01.941 --> 02:13:06.986]  How bad is this going to wound Texas, Oklahoma, the Dakotas, and Canada?
[02:13:07.976 --> 02:13:15.424]  It's going to particularly hit Texas, North Dakota, and Alberta and Canada because that's where most of this is concentrated.
[02:13:15.424 --> 02:13:24.413]  And again, most of these crackers and oil sands people can't break even unless oil is over $80 or at least over $55.
[02:13:26.214 --> 02:13:28.496]  10 to 20 in the next several years.
[02:13:28.496 --> 02:13:40.362]  So this is their, what they're doing is they're pumping their existing wells to the max to create cash flow because their wells are, it's not expensive to pump, it's expensive to find the darn things and drill.
[02:13:40.362 --> 02:13:48.306]  And they were only able to do that with the cheapest junk bonds in history because of quantitative easing and artificial stimulus and high oil price.
[02:13:48.306 --> 02:13:50.768]  So that's the next thing to hit the United States.
[02:13:50.768 --> 02:13:52.509]  But here's the real thing.
[02:13:52.509 --> 02:13:54.450]  The biggest bubble in China,
[02:13:55.296 --> 02:13:56.497]  It's not the stock market.
[02:13:56.497 --> 02:14:03.302]  By the way, it went up 160% in less than a year and has fallen near 40% here in just a matter of a month.
[02:14:03.302 --> 02:14:06.384]  But the Chinese save way more money than us.
[02:14:06.384 --> 02:14:09.427]  They have no social net and welfare and stuff.
[02:14:09.427 --> 02:14:12.109]  And they've always saved more because they've been poor.
[02:14:12.109 --> 02:14:16.192]  And even the rich save 75% of their income, the everyday 55%.
[02:14:16.192 --> 02:14:17.273]  And guess where they put it?
[02:14:17.273 --> 02:14:20.115]  They put it mostly in the real estate, way more.
[02:14:20.655 --> 02:14:20.895]  Thank you.
[02:14:34.986 --> 02:14:47.220]  But when real estate stopped going up, then people started speculating in stocks, which the Chinese don't normally do, and that's why they got such a crazy bubble when two-thirds of the new accounts were opened by people who didn't have a high school education.
[02:14:47.220 --> 02:14:50.965]  So this is really dumb money, and that's why it's failing so fast.
[02:14:51.885 --> 02:14:58.370]  But it's when the Chinese real estate market finally gets hit harder like Singapore has recently here.
[02:14:58.370 --> 02:15:05.395]  Boy, when that happens, the implosion of wealth in the second largest and fastest growing country in the world is going to be unbelievable.
[02:15:05.395 --> 02:15:10.718]  It's going to be like the Japanese in the early 90s when their real estate bubbles imploded.
[02:15:10.718 --> 02:15:15.762]  They stopped buying real estate everywhere and they were the lead buyers in the key cities.
[02:15:15.762 --> 02:15:20.345]  So you're saying, I mean to be specific, you're saying you think we'll have a dead cat bounce out of China?
[02:15:21.126 --> 02:15:26.036]  And for a few months and then as we go into the fall, you think it's going to go down?
[02:15:27.017 --> 02:15:28.818]  Yes, yeah, and same thing.
[02:15:28.818 --> 02:15:32.059]  We've had a dead cat bounce and oil is starting to go down.
[02:15:32.059 --> 02:15:37.741]  When oil gets back in the low 40s, people are going to realize these frackers are dead and they're going to have to default.
[02:15:37.741 --> 02:15:41.642]  Everybody's listening to T-Boom Pickens and people saying, oh, oil will be back to $80.
[02:15:41.642 --> 02:15:42.782]  Well, you know what?
[02:15:42.782 --> 02:15:44.363]  It's not going to be.
[02:15:44.363 --> 02:15:50.085]  The leading experts and princes in Saudi Arabia said we will never see $100 oil again.
[02:15:50.085 --> 02:15:52.646]  And I agree with that at least for many decades.
[02:15:52.646 --> 02:15:53.366]  I don't know about ever.
[02:15:54.171 --> 02:16:00.675]  I mean, China bubble bursting and the fracking bubble bursting are the two biggest things I see.
[02:16:00.675 --> 02:16:07.159]  Here's my question, and almost everything you said has been right on for 20 years, but here's my concern.
[02:16:07.159 --> 02:16:09.261]  I get that we're going into a depression.
[02:16:10.543 --> 02:16:17.625]  People retiring, less money, debts are huge, that causes a real economy, depression, prices should fall.
[02:16:17.625 --> 02:16:38.432]  But things are so rigged, and they're still going ahead with QE Unlimited all over the world, I don't see how down the road other commodities like gold and silver don't go up, especially when so many elitists and institutions are quietly buying gold, or is that not as an investment, just as an emergency backup?
[02:16:39.281 --> 02:16:44.807]  Yeah, but they're doing emergency buying of stocks, and it didn't work in 1929 for long, and it's not going to work in China.
[02:16:44.807 --> 02:16:52.555]  But down the road, commodities are going to be big, and I do see gold at $5,000, but it's like 15 to 20 years from now.
[02:16:54.717 --> 02:16:56.818]  We have to go to this deflation first.
[02:16:56.818 --> 02:17:09.203]  When you get a bubble burst, Alex, there are $225 trillion of loans, bonds, stocks, financial assets around the globe now, and that's gone way up with these bubbles.
[02:17:10.197 --> 02:17:13.078]  A hundred trillion of that could disappear overnight.
[02:17:13.078 --> 02:17:15.479]  That is real wealth and money to people.
[02:17:15.479 --> 02:17:16.639]  Real estate could fall.
[02:17:16.639 --> 02:17:18.100]  Let's not even count it.
[02:17:18.100 --> 02:17:20.361]  Oh yeah, people lose most of their savings and everything.
[02:17:20.361 --> 02:17:22.421]  It is going to be a hellish pullback.
[02:17:22.421 --> 02:17:25.462]  We will be a long... Here's my concern.
[02:17:25.462 --> 02:17:26.863]  How bad will this depression be?
[02:17:26.863 --> 02:17:29.704]  Because I don't want to scare people, but I've confirmed
[02:17:30.504 --> 02:17:36.586]  The military's storing food, police departments are digging in, they're getting armored vehicles delivered, that's admitted.
[02:17:36.586 --> 02:17:49.329]  I've got the Ministry of Defense and the Pentagon's own declassified reports where they believe a collapse is coming by 2017, and they said that eight years ago, so quietly, they agree with you, but how bad could this collapse be?
[02:17:49.329 --> 02:17:51.590]  I mean, we're talking about something far worse than 2008, aren't we?
[02:17:53.010 --> 02:17:55.411]  Yeah, well, it's definitely going to be worse than 2008.
[02:17:55.411 --> 02:17:58.673]  Every crash has been worse since 2000 crash.
[02:17:58.673 --> 02:18:00.714]  We had a series of crashes.
[02:18:00.714 --> 02:18:12.961]  And to me, you don't really see how bad it's going to be until you actually see debts fail and major defaults and loans going bad and 78% crashes in major stock markets.
[02:18:12.961 --> 02:18:14.642]  And that's exactly what happened in the early 30s.
[02:18:14.642 --> 02:18:16.943]  So I think this is going to be like the early 30s.
[02:18:16.943 --> 02:18:22.126]  And I think it's going to be much worse because governments have now kept this bubble going.
[02:18:22.606 --> 02:18:32.574]  With quantitative easing, artificial stimulus, zero interest rates, long and short term when you adjust for inflation, they kept this thing going for six more years!
[02:18:32.574 --> 02:18:36.657]  It's like taking more of a drug to keep from coming down.
[02:18:36.657 --> 02:18:40.620]  The longer you take the drug, the worse your collapse is when you finally come down.
[02:18:40.620 --> 02:18:44.062]  We can handle a couple of Detroit's, but what if we have 20 of them?
[02:18:44.062 --> 02:18:47.205]  Doesn't this become almost a road warrior scenario in many areas?
[02:18:48.120 --> 02:18:48.560]  Well, it does.
[02:18:48.560 --> 02:18:49.121]  That's what happens.
[02:18:49.121 --> 02:18:50.903]  People say Greece is no big thing.
[02:18:50.903 --> 02:18:55.367]  Greece is small, but it's the first major country or entity to default.
[02:18:55.367 --> 02:19:02.373]  And when that happens, people start looking for defaults elsewhere, and the bond markets get jittery, and interest rates go up.
[02:19:02.373 --> 02:19:03.354]  Well, take a canary.
[02:19:03.354 --> 02:19:06.597]  A canary's small in a coal mine, but you watch it.
[02:19:07.634 --> 02:19:09.055]  It's a trigger.
[02:19:09.055 --> 02:19:14.978]  And again, the subprime crisis was the trigger for the last crunch in 2008.
[02:19:14.978 --> 02:19:19.260]  In the U.S., we triggered the whole world crisis in four states.
[02:19:19.260 --> 02:19:21.721]  So it wasn't that big.
[02:19:21.721 --> 02:19:25.843]  And the fracking industry alone is almost as big as that subprime crisis.
[02:19:25.843 --> 02:19:27.284]  So we've got a whole bunch of triggers.
[02:19:28.121 --> 02:19:28.541]  All right.
[02:19:48.097 --> 02:19:52.543]  Yeah Alex, long-term rates from Germany to Japan to the U.S.
[02:19:52.543 --> 02:19:56.609]  and of course Greece are going up now despite runaway QE.
[02:19:56.609 --> 02:19:58.351]  Stay there, explain that to us when we come back.
[02:19:59.127 --> 02:20:03.769]  Have you ever wondered if you could make electric, light, or heat in your home for free?
[02:20:03.769 --> 02:20:06.690]  How about a motor that charges batteries at the same time?
[02:20:06.690 --> 02:20:10.912]  What if this also restores useless batteries and saves you lots of money?

[02:24:07.194 --> 02:24:08.215]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:24:08.215 --> 02:24:10.056]  HarryDent.com.
[02:24:10.056 --> 02:24:19.566]  Go to HarryDent.com forward slash Alex Jones and you can get a free chapter of his book, specials on his book, The Demographic Cliff and more.
[02:24:20.942 --> 02:24:24.565]  And he looks at a whole bunch of different demographic trends throughout history.
[02:24:24.565 --> 02:24:26.527]  History doesn't repeat, it rhymes.
[02:24:26.527 --> 02:24:27.948]  I forget who said that.
[02:24:27.948 --> 02:24:31.250]  But it does repeat itself over and over again.
[02:24:31.250 --> 02:24:33.772]  And what about my question about war?
[02:24:33.772 --> 02:24:36.054]  Because we're going to come back in the next segment and take calls.
[02:24:36.054 --> 02:24:39.036]  You've agreed to do that, I appreciate it, from Brandon and others.
[02:24:39.036 --> 02:24:40.538]  But what about historically?
[02:24:41.579 --> 02:24:41.799]  I don't
[02:25:03.088 --> 02:25:07.153]  In conflict and in potential conflict in this season.
[02:25:07.153 --> 02:25:12.259]  What are your graphs and charts that you have on your site that you go over say about war?
[02:25:13.444 --> 02:25:14.164]  Well, two things.
[02:25:14.164 --> 02:25:18.706]  The World War II, the greatest war in history, followed the Great Depression.
[02:25:18.706 --> 02:25:25.068]  The Great Depression and the hyperinflation in the early 20s in Germany set up Hitler to rise.
[02:25:25.068 --> 02:25:27.168]  People were very dissatisfied.
[02:25:27.168 --> 02:25:32.230]  And so when he said, hey, we're doing horribly, but hey, the way we can grow is to go attack everybody else.
[02:25:32.230 --> 02:25:33.910]  People like, yeah, yeah, why not?
[02:25:33.910 --> 02:25:36.111]  So that was a big trigger for that.
[02:25:36.111 --> 02:25:39.592]  And my thing, we have a geopolitical cycle.
[02:25:40.172 --> 02:26:02.020]  If it is positive for 18 years, like 83 to 2000, and negative from 9-11 through early 2020, if we're going to see increasing conflict in the Middle East, which is already obvious, and in other parts of the world, and greater tensions between, let's say, China and Japan, Russia and the U.S., anything else, Russia and Europe, it's going to happen, and likely to happen, in the next five years.
[02:26:02.020 --> 02:26:05.861]  I don't think it's going to be as much like World War II, only because
[02:26:06.576 --> 02:26:10.020]  We don't have the same alignment of major powers that can fight each other.
[02:26:10.020 --> 02:26:19.551]  There's nobody that can fully challenge the United States because China's whole military efforts and defense spending is met on controlling their own people because they're not a democracy.
[02:26:20.279 --> 02:26:23.561]  And you've always said it's a paper dragon militarily.
[02:26:23.561 --> 02:26:26.462]  Oh my, yeah, military, outgoing.
[02:26:26.462 --> 02:26:30.064]  China cannot attack us like Japan did or Germany.
[02:26:30.064 --> 02:26:31.085]  They just can't.
[02:26:31.085 --> 02:26:36.688]  But they could cause problems in their sphere, and there are growing tensions between China and Japan.
[02:26:36.688 --> 02:26:41.290]  There's growing tensions everywhere, and that's one of the reasons a lot of these stock market guys say,
[02:26:41.670 --> 02:26:45.372]  Oh, the stock market's not as overvalued as it was in 2000 when it crashed.
[02:26:45.372 --> 02:26:48.114]  Well, the world is three times more risky than it was in 2000.
[02:26:48.114 --> 02:26:50.355]  There was no risk in the world.
[02:26:50.355 --> 02:26:51.655]  Nothing gone wrong for 18 years.
[02:26:53.416 --> 02:26:59.719]  So they're underestimating the risk and overestimating the value of stocks.
[02:26:59.719 --> 02:27:03.421]  So this is going to be a stock market crash around the world.
[02:27:03.421 --> 02:27:05.942]  More important, real estate around the world.
[02:27:05.942 --> 02:27:15.466]  And when China goes, especially in real estate, that's when people are going to get, oh my gosh, even Vancouver can't hold up, even London, even New York.
[02:27:15.606 --> 02:27:20.111]  What about a Chicago going under, or Puerto Rico like you mentioned, or California?
[02:27:20.111 --> 02:27:22.634]  I mean, everybody shakes their finger at Greece.
[02:27:22.634 --> 02:27:26.759]  Aren't we, if you count local debt and all the rest of it, and even more debt than Greece?
[02:27:28.015 --> 02:27:32.976]  Yeah, well we have more private debt than Greece, you know, compared to our economy.
[02:27:32.976 --> 02:27:37.078]  Greece has the most public debt outside of Japan and Ireland.
[02:27:37.078 --> 02:27:52.562]  But I'm telling you, Alex, you look around the world, most countries have close to four times GDP in private and public debt, and then they have another double that, up to eight times the United States in unfunded liabilities for Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid.
[02:27:52.562 --> 02:27:55.303]  But Obama said raising the debt limit doesn't raise the debt.
[02:27:55.303 --> 02:27:56.263]  Are you saying he's a liar?
[02:27:57.335 --> 02:28:08.041]  Well, I'm just saying we're going to run deficits forever because we've made commitments to the aging baby boom generation that will not be possible to be paid out of present.
[02:28:08.041 --> 02:28:08.462]  Sure, sure.
[02:28:08.462 --> 02:28:11.443]  I was being sarcastic about the Obama thing.
[02:28:11.443 --> 02:28:14.905]  But what about the young people refusing to do this for the baby boomers?
[02:28:14.905 --> 02:28:17.287]  Isn't that going to create a whole new split?
[02:28:18.018 --> 02:28:24.903]  Yeah, I think basically young people are going to start to say, we've got to start shooting old people.
[02:28:24.903 --> 02:28:33.810]  I hate to put it that way, but there's no way they can pay for the baby boom benefit, especially in an economy that's going to be very slow because of this debt deleveraging.
[02:28:34.230 --> 02:28:42.338]  But also our demographics, our workforce is going to grow a half a percent the rest of the decade, even if the economy stays good.
[02:28:42.338 --> 02:28:45.161]  And then it's going to grow zero for the next decade after that.
[02:28:45.161 --> 02:28:46.622]  And then it's going to grow slowly again.
[02:28:46.622 --> 02:28:51.587]  We're just not going to see the type of growth that can pay off these entitlements.
[02:28:51.587 --> 02:28:53.509]  So we're going to run deficits forever.
[02:28:53.509 --> 02:28:54.330]  And at some point,
[02:28:55.150 --> 02:28:58.511]  In the depths of a crisis, we will have to say, you know what?
[02:28:58.511 --> 02:29:02.493]  We've got to retire at 72 to 75 instead of 62 to 65.
[02:29:02.493 --> 02:29:05.914]  The Greeks are retiring at 55, for crying out loud.
[02:29:05.914 --> 02:29:08.295]  People want to die and go to heaven, you know?
[02:29:08.295 --> 02:29:11.136]  And that doesn't work in the economy.
[02:29:11.136 --> 02:29:13.756]  We're going to go to break, come back and take some phone calls.
[02:29:13.756 --> 02:29:18.258]  What else as a trigger, just briefly in the 30 seconds we have, what other triggers are out there?
[02:29:19.451 --> 02:29:22.234]  Well, again, debt ratios are high everywhere.
[02:29:22.234 --> 02:29:25.818]  Once the economy gets worse, all these debts get triggered.
[02:29:26.611 --> 02:29:29.452]  And people say, oh, the banks look solvent now.
[02:29:29.452 --> 02:29:31.593]  They won't look solvent if real estate goes down another 40%.
[02:29:31.593 --> 02:29:35.935]  They're going to be in deeper trouble than they were in 2008 and 2012.
[02:29:35.935 --> 02:29:41.377]  I think the real estate decline around the world, and I see a bigger decline just like stocks.
[02:29:41.377 --> 02:29:42.057]  It's the big trigger.
[02:29:42.057 --> 02:29:44.918]  Real estate that hits is backed by mortgages.
[02:29:44.918 --> 02:29:45.358]  Stay there.
[02:29:45.358 --> 02:29:47.099]  We're going to go over all the triggers.
[02:29:47.099 --> 02:29:48.379]  You have a chart on that.
[02:29:48.379 --> 02:29:49.780]  We're on the march.
[02:29:49.780 --> 02:29:51.300]  The empire's on the run.
[02:29:51.300 --> 02:29:52.301]  Paul's coming up.
[02:29:52.301 --> 02:29:54.982]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:29:58.956 --> 02:30:05.721]  When speaking about ISIS, President Obama recently said this, Ideologies are not defeated with guns.
[02:30:05.721 --> 02:30:08.102]  They're defeated by better ideas.
[02:30:08.102 --> 02:30:12.465]  The President was meeting with military leaders at the Pentagon when he made the comment.
[02:30:12.465 --> 02:30:19.190]  Perhaps Obama should have considered this notion before continuing the policy of flooding the chaotic Middle East with weapons.
[02:30:19.830 --> 02:30:23.153]  As Infowars has tirelessly documented, U.S.
[02:30:23.153 --> 02:30:35.302]  weapons have fallen into ISIS hands time and time again, and bolstered the terror group via the insane policy of arming and training the so-called moderate rebels in Libya, Syria, and Iraq.
[02:30:35.942 --> 02:30:44.289]  The CIA has shipped weapons to Al Qaeda-affiliated groups in Syria since at least 2012, a fact reported by the New York Times.
[02:30:44.289 --> 02:30:47.191]  Iraqi intelligence even claims that the U.S.
[02:30:47.191 --> 02:30:51.875]  is intentionally dropping weapons to known ISIS-linked groups of rebels.
[02:30:51.875 --> 02:30:54.477]  Where were the better ideas when it mattered?
[02:30:54.477 --> 02:30:58.881]  You can find more reports on InfoWars.com.

[02:32:11.097 --> 02:32:18.166]  We have rejected literally hundreds of products from the Infowarslife line because they are not of the very highest quality.
[02:32:18.166 --> 02:32:18.866]  We're good to go.
[02:32:39.011 --> 02:32:39.551]  We're good.
[02:33:07.361 --> 02:33:18.104]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:33:18.104 --> 02:33:24.866]  All I know is there's 2.2, according to the Congressional Budget Office, estimated global derivatives.
[02:33:24.866 --> 02:33:30.208]  They have articles I've read in USA Today years ago, you know, saying that basically 60% of that we've signed on to.
[02:33:31.237 --> 02:33:33.459]  We're talking about over a thousand trillion.
[02:33:33.459 --> 02:33:35.200]  That's not my debt.
[02:33:35.200 --> 02:33:40.225]  Our real debt's like 19 trillion if you look out at what we supposedly have signed on to.
[02:33:40.225 --> 02:33:42.087]  It's more like a hundred plus trillion.
[02:33:42.087 --> 02:33:42.667]  Whatever.
[02:33:42.667 --> 02:33:45.009]  It's all untenable.
[02:33:45.009 --> 02:33:50.374]  And then I see the socialist generation, the Bernie Sanders supporters, running around.
[02:33:50.374 --> 02:33:54.477]  I mean, I saw them on ABC News going, I want my student loans paid off.
[02:33:54.477 --> 02:33:55.699]  Or I want this and that.
[02:33:55.699 --> 02:33:56.579]  I want this free.
[02:33:56.579 --> 02:33:57.320]  I want that free.
[02:33:57.320 --> 02:33:58.221]  They just don't get it.
[02:33:59.707 --> 02:34:03.348]  The free lunch is about to be over.
[02:34:03.348 --> 02:34:06.589]  And the problem is the corporate free lunch isn't.
[02:34:06.589 --> 02:34:07.729]  Most corporations are good.
[02:34:07.729 --> 02:34:08.869]  Most companies are good.
[02:34:08.869 --> 02:34:12.770]  But the big top ones are a bunch of crony insiders.
[02:34:12.770 --> 02:34:14.651]  They've gotten away with everything you can imagine.
[02:34:14.651 --> 02:34:19.472]  They're the ones that count on totalitarianism to keep their butts out of jail.
[02:34:19.472 --> 02:34:23.353]  They think they can just buy off governments and that long term they'll be safe.
[02:34:23.353 --> 02:34:25.634]  They would have been safe not robbing the economy.
[02:34:26.471 --> 02:34:29.133]  And just skimming off the top in a legitimate way.
[02:34:29.133 --> 02:34:31.916]  I'm all for wealth creation and wealth.
[02:34:31.916 --> 02:34:37.441]  But you have crony capitalists scapegoating real capitalism.
[02:34:37.441 --> 02:34:38.682]  And I see that as the problem.
[02:34:38.682 --> 02:34:43.025]  I see the big trigger is that once we go into just a recessionary depression,
[02:34:44.073 --> 02:34:59.878]  That is a recession for some, depression for others, that the spoiled brats out there are going to use the crisis to have a political move to take over the government even more and nationalize and redistribute like Venezuela did, and then they'll really destroy the economy.
[02:34:59.878 --> 02:35:03.440]  Because we can always rebuild the economy quickly if we have free market.
[02:35:03.440 --> 02:35:07.681]  If we don't, we're living like the new Soviet Union.
[02:35:07.681 --> 02:35:09.782]  I want to go to some phone calls for our guests.
[02:35:10.745 --> 02:35:16.867]  Harry Dent of HarryDent.com, again, who predicted that the next big trigger would be China.
[02:35:16.867 --> 02:35:18.348]  He was just here two weeks ago saying it.
[02:35:18.348 --> 02:35:21.229]  He was here a year ago saying it, five years ago saying it.
[02:35:21.229 --> 02:35:22.990]  It's now happening.
[02:35:22.990 --> 02:35:28.212]  The media is being very calm about this, but even British papers say it could be a new global depression.
[02:35:28.932 --> 02:35:30.754]  The Chinese are pulling all their money out of the banks.
[02:35:30.754 --> 02:35:31.855]  There's not enough.
[02:35:31.855 --> 02:35:33.537]  Greece is doing it.
[02:35:33.537 --> 02:35:37.341]  Our banks are making moves saying we won't give you cash soon.
[02:35:37.341 --> 02:35:44.008]  So I see a lot of regulations being changed, a lot of preparation for what I call battening down the hatches.
[02:35:45.996 --> 02:35:54.403]  Going over your demographic cliff, going over the different triggers on the graph you put out a few years ago, I see a few of those things have now happened.
[02:35:54.403 --> 02:36:08.834]  But what about my rant, my concern about the social response we're going to see and all the race war mongering going on by these socialists who want to see a civil war in this country because they're dreaming of 1917 Russia.
[02:36:10.835 --> 02:36:12.277]  I mean, I'm not being sarcastic.
[02:36:12.277 --> 02:36:24.731]  We've got some really kooky, bizarre, sick people who openly say they want a Cloward and Piven collapse because then they can have their socialist takeover with Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders.
[02:36:26.854 --> 02:36:30.495]  Well, you know, I mean, I've never seen more polarization.
[02:36:30.495 --> 02:36:35.517]  It's as much from the rich to the everyday person as it was at the top of the Roaring Twenties.
[02:36:35.517 --> 02:36:40.939]  But the political polarization is extreme, especially in the United States.
[02:36:40.939 --> 02:36:43.680]  I expect there to be a certain amount of civil unrest.
[02:36:43.680 --> 02:36:48.101]  When you see higher unemployment, you always see higher crime.
[02:36:48.101 --> 02:36:49.902]  In a place like China, when they moved
[02:36:50.542 --> 02:37:10.379]  Hundreds of millions of people in a little over a decade into cities with no skills, and they're not even legal citizens of those cities, when this machine of overbuilding everything to keep the economy going by a top-down government happens, these people are going to be trapped, and they're going to have nowhere to go except a squat in the empty condos will be their only thing.
[02:37:10.379 --> 02:37:18.026]  So I'd say, you know, like the United States and China are two places I see is the most ripe for
[02:37:20.311 --> 02:37:24.934]  Level of social unrest and where you live is important.
[02:37:24.934 --> 02:37:29.877]  I've sold all my real estate in recent years because we saw the real estate thing coming.
[02:37:29.877 --> 02:37:35.121]  I kept one property on an island because I want some place to go if things get really bad.
[02:37:36.288 --> 02:37:42.293]  And that's what the elite's doing, and we talked about it years ago, but now it's in the Guardian, it's in the New York Times.
[02:37:42.293 --> 02:37:58.928]  Their billionaires are building secret airstrips with armored redoubts and basically hiring long-term security teams and giving them stock accounts to basically never leave them, I guess annuities.
[02:37:58.928 --> 02:38:03.232]  I mean, wow, when you see that type of behavior, it makes you ask, how bad will it get?
[02:38:04.281 --> 02:38:18.644]  Well, again, the other thing we show about China is the wealthiest people in the last several years that have been leaving in droves, what they do is they say, oh, we're just getting our kid an education in California or New York or London or Sydney, Australia, and a good university.
[02:38:18.644 --> 02:38:22.425]  Oh, and while we're there, we're going to buy a $20 million house.
[02:38:22.425 --> 02:38:25.306]  What they're doing is laundering their money out of the country.
[02:38:25.706 --> 02:38:29.008]  The rich Chinese see this crash in China coming.
[02:38:29.008 --> 02:38:30.529]  They see the overbuilding.
[02:38:30.529 --> 02:38:35.412]  They don't trust the government that's not elected and that, like you say, is crony capitalism.
[02:38:35.412 --> 02:38:37.273]  They're getting out.
[02:38:37.273 --> 02:38:38.614]  That is not a good sign.
[02:38:38.614 --> 02:38:44.477]  Well, I talked to a big defense contractor owner five years ago and they said within five to six years, the quote, the U.S.
[02:38:44.477 --> 02:38:46.298]  as you know it, won't be there.
[02:38:46.298 --> 02:38:49.160]  And then I ran into, outside of Austin,
[02:38:50.100 --> 02:38:51.780]  John Wayne's son.
[02:38:51.780 --> 02:38:54.661]  And I didn't even know who it was when I was first talking to him.
[02:38:54.661 --> 02:38:59.182]  My kids were camping out at a ranch next door in a house of some doctors I know.
[02:38:59.182 --> 02:39:02.363]  And then I was talking to them and they're like, yeah, we're leaving to Costa Rica.
[02:39:02.363 --> 02:39:04.723]  You won't be able to get your money out in about a year.
[02:39:04.723 --> 02:39:10.004]  And then there's going to be a collapse for the next six, seven years and all the big money's leaving.
[02:39:10.004 --> 02:39:13.385]  And of course, I talked about it at the time, but it's just, it's like,
[02:39:14.420 --> 02:39:18.186]  Then the public acts like I'm trying to fear monger.
[02:39:18.186 --> 02:39:21.492]  All I'm doing is telling people what's really going on, and I wish it wasn't true.
[02:39:23.467 --> 02:39:24.227]  Yeah, I mean, same thing.
[02:39:24.227 --> 02:39:27.069]  I was the most bullish economist from the late 80s on.
[02:39:27.069 --> 02:39:41.177]  I'm not a fear monger by nature, but when you see a bubble of this magnitude and you see it so global, and then on top of that you see governments, and this is unprecedented, saying, when the bubble starts to unravel, we're just not going to accept it.
[02:39:41.177 --> 02:39:46.159]  We're just going to print trillions and trillions of dollars, prop up markets artificially.
[02:39:46.159 --> 02:39:47.200]  This is like fighting with
[02:39:47.680 --> 02:39:48.460]  Sasquatch!
[02:39:48.460 --> 02:39:49.160]  You don't do it.
[02:39:49.160 --> 02:39:50.581]  You don't fight with Mother Nature.
[02:39:50.581 --> 02:39:51.861]  It's bigger than you.
[02:39:51.861 --> 02:39:55.142]  The universe is going to have a big response to this.
[02:39:55.142 --> 02:39:56.722]  The free markets are.
[02:39:56.722 --> 02:40:02.264]  And the good thing, as you kind of hinted at earlier, the good thing about free markets, it can be painful when we make adjustments.
[02:40:02.264 --> 02:40:03.404]  They make them quickly.
[02:40:03.404 --> 02:40:09.106]  It's like you ate some bad sushi and your body's smart enough to just flush it out before it poisons you.
[02:40:09.106 --> 02:40:10.586]  We're not smart enough to do that.
[02:40:10.586 --> 02:40:15.508]  So I do tell people I'm leaning more towards, hey, be more cautious than not.
[02:40:15.508 --> 02:40:16.828]  Not only be out of markets, but
[02:40:17.348 --> 02:40:21.270]  What's the safest kind of best place for you to live and be?
[02:40:21.270 --> 02:40:24.392]  How do you protect yourself in case things get really bad?
[02:40:24.392 --> 02:40:28.775]  I don't know that they will, because we're in a different era than in the 30s, but they might.
[02:40:28.775 --> 02:40:31.556]  And they could get really bad, because this has just been extreme.
[02:40:31.556 --> 02:40:41.222]  And I've never seen this much irresponsibility in financial and fiscal management, never any time in history.
[02:40:42.776 --> 02:40:49.761]  Well, InfoWars.com is here covering it, and we've been accurate, our guests have been accurate, you've been extremely accurate.
[02:40:49.761 --> 02:41:00.068]  And then I look at the very central banks, the very crony capitalists that have helped all this happen, and they are going to be set to get more bailouts, more power out of this.
[02:41:00.068 --> 02:41:10.275]  I wonder, my last question before we go to calls for you, Mr. Dennis, do you think the establishment crony capitalists will get out of this without getting in trouble the next round?
[02:41:10.275 --> 02:41:11.716]  I mean, are they really too big to fail?
[02:41:13.706 --> 02:41:20.751]  I think some of them will, but I think that the central banks are going to lose massive credibility.
[02:41:20.751 --> 02:41:22.492]  They've done the stupidest thing in history.
[02:41:22.492 --> 02:41:24.153]  It's worked for five or six years.
[02:41:24.153 --> 02:41:25.854]  Again, you want to feel better?
[02:41:25.854 --> 02:41:26.714]  Take a drug.
[02:41:26.714 --> 02:41:28.395]  You know, there's tons of drugs you can take.
[02:41:28.395 --> 02:41:29.516]  It never works out well.
[02:41:29.516 --> 02:41:30.877]  That's what they've done financially.
[02:41:31.477 --> 02:41:34.961]  This is going to end badly and they're going to lose credibility.
[02:41:34.961 --> 02:41:37.604]  Some of the crony capitalists are going to go down with them.
[02:41:37.604 --> 02:41:39.105]  Other ones are big enough.
[02:41:39.105 --> 02:41:44.271]  I mean, the thing about a time like the 1930s is the strongest survive.
[02:41:44.271 --> 02:41:47.394]  The dominant market share companies survive.
[02:41:47.394 --> 02:41:48.215]  But I tell you,
[02:41:48.775 --> 02:41:51.017]  Lobbying is going to take a big hit.
[02:41:51.017 --> 02:41:54.959]  My number one recommendation in my book is to say, what should governments do in the future?
[02:41:54.959 --> 02:41:56.861]  No lobbyists.
[02:41:56.861 --> 02:41:58.081]  You don't have it at all.
[02:41:58.081 --> 02:42:07.328]  You don't let companies with special interests tell you what you should do in economic policies because they're going to tell you what's good for them and not what's good for you or the country.
[02:42:08.049 --> 02:42:10.170]  Yeah, that's America and the whole world's biggest problem.
[02:42:10.170 --> 02:42:12.412]  That's why third world countries are third world countries.
[02:42:12.412 --> 02:42:22.938]  It's that they have special interests that destroy basic level playing field for their interest and then end up destroying the entire system long term.
[02:42:22.938 --> 02:42:26.821]  I mean, it's a suicidal perspective.
[02:42:26.821 --> 02:42:33.665]  We look at demographics around the world, but when we see countries are still poor because of good demographics, we know there's corruption.
[02:42:33.665 --> 02:42:35.146]  We know there's crony capitalism.
[02:42:35.146 --> 02:42:36.187]  It's kind of tribal
[02:42:37.006 --> 02:42:41.728]  Tribal economics, which is not good.
[02:42:41.728 --> 02:42:51.073]  And that's what America's going into, is all these tribal groups and subgroups, and it's being done by design, by the ruling establishment, who are just playing with fire.
[02:42:51.073 --> 02:42:52.614]  Brandon in Texas, thanks for holding.
[02:42:52.614 --> 02:42:55.496]  You're on the air with Mr. Dent.
[02:42:55.496 --> 02:42:56.456]  How are you doing today?
[02:42:56.456 --> 02:42:57.917]  Good, brother.
[02:42:57.917 --> 02:43:01.779]  I have three questions, if you guys have the time.
[02:43:01.779 --> 02:43:05.881]  My first question is, China, who owns the majority of their debt?
[02:43:08.888 --> 02:43:12.370]  Well, I mean, their debt is just like ours.
[02:43:12.370 --> 02:43:14.332]  The government has a certain amount.
[02:43:14.332 --> 02:43:22.257]  They push more of their debt down into the local communist parties, and they make it easy for them to borrow money.
[02:43:22.257 --> 02:43:26.480]  So it's the local governments that owe the most debt.
[02:43:26.480 --> 02:43:30.823]  They also have very low interest rates, forced by the government on savers.
[02:43:30.823 --> 02:43:32.844]  So savers over there put money in
[02:43:34.365 --> 02:43:35.406]  All right.
[02:43:35.406 --> 02:43:36.327]  Other questions, Brandon?
[02:44:04.212 --> 02:44:05.835]  Yes, sir.
[02:44:05.835 --> 02:44:12.830]  Now, once we hit this economic collapse, pretty much, how would that affect the homeowner that's still paying on a mortgage?
[02:44:14.887 --> 02:44:17.369]  Well, there's a bad and good there.
[02:44:17.369 --> 02:44:34.839]  If you've got a really high mortgage against a falling equity, I would almost say just hang on to it, because at some point I think governments are going to be forced into telling the banks what they should have told them in the first place, mark down your mortgage loans and your loans to market value.
[02:44:34.839 --> 02:44:38.822]  By pumping all this money into the banks, they have not had to do that.
[02:44:39.432 --> 02:44:46.623]  If you've got a house with higher equity, higher real estate, I've been saying sell it unless it's like my little getaway place.
[02:44:47.321 --> 02:45:06.659]  Sell it because you can turn that into cash now and when you get this great deflation, and this is going to be deflation, deleveraging of debt and financial assets, you're going to be able to buy houses, beachfront real estate, companies, all types of stuff at 20 cents on the dollar, 10, 20, 30 cents.
[02:45:06.659 --> 02:45:10.383]  It's going to be the buying opportunity of a lifetime, but you've got to have cash
[02:45:11.544 --> 02:45:16.689]  Stay liquid is harrydent.com recommendation.
[02:45:16.689 --> 02:45:17.550]  Okay Brandon, thank you.
[02:45:17.550 --> 02:45:18.291]  Good questions.
[02:45:18.291 --> 02:45:19.833]  Gerald in California, you're on the air.
[02:45:22.014 --> 02:45:24.695]  Hey, how's it going, guys?
[02:45:24.695 --> 02:45:26.296]  Look up to both you guys.
[02:45:26.296 --> 02:45:28.136]  So, I'll make this quick.
[02:45:28.136 --> 02:45:49.185]  The financial crisis that's coming that has to do with this fiat currency system, do you guys think this is a strategic plan to wean us into the Swissindo or any, you know, kind of takeovers by the UN on the, or, you know, introducing us into a new financial system, but obviously getting fight back from the people?
[02:45:49.969 --> 02:45:51.650]  Gerald, that's a great question.
[02:45:51.650 --> 02:45:53.152]  I would ask the question this way.
[02:45:53.152 --> 02:46:03.300]  Obviously, the different establishments that work together, the G20 and stuff, they have exit strategies out of this to always get more power out of the crises they helped incubate.
[02:46:03.300 --> 02:46:06.743]  What do you think will come out of this ultimately?
[02:46:06.743 --> 02:46:08.645]  Right now, it looks like governments are turning to tyranny.
[02:46:11.144 --> 02:46:12.625]  Well yeah, you see both of that.
[02:46:12.625 --> 02:46:15.868]  You're going to see, I think you're going to see power decentralized.
[02:46:15.868 --> 02:46:18.710]  Europe is going to break down into smaller units again.
[02:46:18.710 --> 02:46:22.534]  That may even happen to some degree in the United States.
[02:46:22.534 --> 02:46:31.741]  On the other hand, there's always some people, some entities government-wise and major corporations that because everything else is falling, they get stronger.
[02:46:31.741 --> 02:46:34.484]  And if they do have the cash and the power, they will do that.
[02:46:34.484 --> 02:46:35.805]  So you're going to see some of both.
[02:46:35.805 --> 02:46:37.006]  But I actually see
[02:46:38.164 --> 02:46:39.545]  More decentralization.
[02:46:39.545 --> 02:46:44.087]  I don't think the United States is going to be as powerful militarily as it was in the past.
[02:46:44.087 --> 02:46:45.808]  That's already happening.
[02:46:45.808 --> 02:46:50.791]  And so it's going to be kind of a funny world where you don't, you know, where governments fail.
[02:46:50.791 --> 02:46:53.813]  I mean, when these major central banks do this
[02:46:54.491 --> 02:47:00.232]  Fourteen trillion dollars of global stimulus and everything else, and then the economy gets worse?
[02:47:00.232 --> 02:47:02.573]  Who's going to have faith in these people?
[02:47:02.573 --> 02:47:07.814]  And there's going to be major reforms of the banking system, and they're not going to allow the banks... That's what Ron Paul says.
[02:47:07.814 --> 02:47:18.377]  He says we can come in and restore a ton of basic common sense and free market ideas, but the danger is the socialists and all their idiot followers are going to try to take over during the crisis.
[02:47:19.861 --> 02:47:22.782]  Yeah, and then there'll be both of that.
[02:47:22.782 --> 02:47:24.843]  People only do the right thing in a crisis.
[02:47:24.843 --> 02:47:30.205]  When the barn's burning down, people run in, save the horse, the dog, and the baby, and run out.
[02:47:30.205 --> 02:47:33.286]  Everyday people become heroes, just like in 9-11.
[02:47:33.286 --> 02:47:36.107]  But most of the time, people are too scared to do something.
[02:47:36.107 --> 02:47:45.331]  When we get reality, there's going to be some really good reforms come out of it, but there's going to be some really bad people try to take over power in ways they can, because a crisis
[02:47:45.831 --> 02:47:49.933]  Yeah, I got some really potent truth I want to run down with you really quickly.
[02:47:49.933 --> 02:47:51.154]  It's going to bless you and your listeners.
[02:48:14.996 --> 02:48:16.218]  It's about Jade Helm.
[02:48:16.218 --> 02:48:18.600]  It's about Child Protective Services.
[02:48:18.600 --> 02:48:20.923]  I'm going to have to come back to you after Mr. Dent leaves us.
[02:48:20.923 --> 02:48:22.985]  We're going to skip this network break so we have a little bit more time.
[02:48:22.985 --> 02:48:25.187]  I'll do a little bit of overdrive and have to go to you.
[02:48:25.187 --> 02:48:28.591]  But we're taking calls on Greece, the global meltdown, China.
[02:48:28.591 --> 02:48:32.175]  That's the big issue we're covering and it'll be like that throughout the week obviously.
[02:48:32.175 --> 02:48:34.117]  Expect to see more shoes drop.
[02:48:34.117 --> 02:48:36.500]  Notice more and more is happening.
[02:48:37.020 --> 02:48:41.964]  I mean, kind of this quickening that you and others have talked about, so more and more of the triggers getting pulled.
[02:48:41.964 --> 02:48:46.107]  In fact, I want to see if we can put back on screen for TV viewers your chart.
[02:48:46.107 --> 02:48:48.228]  We've been talking about this chart for a while.
[02:48:48.228 --> 02:48:51.731]  How long has this global trigger chart been out there?
[02:48:52.941 --> 02:48:54.002]  Oh, the last couple of years.
[02:48:54.002 --> 02:48:57.203]  I mean, it's the same thing.
[02:48:57.203 --> 02:49:05.527]  The biggest surprise outside of the China bubble bursting, we've been saying for the last few years, is Germany looks worse than Japan did to us in the late 80s.
[02:49:05.527 --> 02:49:07.828]  And we were the only people that saw the fall of Japan.
[02:49:07.828 --> 02:49:10.030]  The only people anywhere, because they were just rising.
[02:49:10.030 --> 02:49:11.050]  They looked good.
[02:49:11.050 --> 02:49:12.711]  But they were at a demographic peak.
[02:49:12.711 --> 02:49:16.773]  They had a major real estate bubble and stock bubble, just like China does today.
[02:49:16.773 --> 02:49:21.015]  And they went down like a lead balloon when the demographics no longer supported them.
[02:49:21.375 --> 02:49:30.858]  Germany has the worst demographics in the next eight years, and only the fall in the euro in the last few years has kept their exports up because they export 50% of their time.
[02:49:30.858 --> 02:49:31.479]  That's right.
[02:49:31.479 --> 02:49:34.820]  I mean, they should be making babies, not Mercedes-Benz.
[02:49:34.820 --> 02:49:37.281]  Carl, in Texas, you're on the air.
[02:49:37.281 --> 02:49:37.641]  Go ahead.
[02:49:39.099 --> 02:49:40.040]  Hey, thanks, gentlemen.
[02:49:40.040 --> 02:49:48.484]  I just want to let you know I bought Harry's book, Demographic Cliff, the last time you had him on, which was a couple weeks ago, and I appreciate that.
[02:49:48.484 --> 02:49:51.225]  Another book that I downloaded for free.
[02:49:51.225 --> 02:50:02.031]  It's a real short, easy read, and it lays this crisis at the feet of the same people that have been doing it since 1907, and that's the central bankers.
[02:50:02.031 --> 02:50:05.873]  It's, it's, it's, uh, none dare call it conspiracy.
[02:50:05.873 --> 02:50:07.433]  Like I said, I downloaded it for free.
[02:50:07.433 --> 02:50:08.574]  Gary Allen, we saw the book.
[02:50:09.366 --> 02:50:23.491]  Yeah, and if you fancy yourself a populist, these guys, the central bankers, recognized the populist movement after they created the central bank or Federal Reserve as a threat.
[02:50:23.491 --> 02:50:34.074]  And the author recognized the populist movement as having some good questions but all the wrong answers because the populist movement identified the central bankers as being a free enterprise.
[02:50:34.074 --> 02:50:34.655]  Well, they're not.
[02:50:34.655 --> 02:50:35.855]  They're all socialists.
[02:50:35.855 --> 02:50:38.676]  So they took that movement over and that's what we have today.
[02:50:39.981 --> 02:50:50.811]  Well, it's true that the super, super rich elites are the ones funding, taking our guns, breaking down our families, getting us in debt.
[02:50:50.811 --> 02:50:58.358]  I mean, they're very parasitic and they wage war against real free market while getting the free market blamed.
[02:50:58.358 --> 02:51:01.681]  So it's really a genius plan, the George Soros's of the world.
[02:51:01.681 --> 02:51:04.203]  I appreciate your call.
[02:51:04.203 --> 02:51:05.845]  Mr. Dent, your take on what he was just saying?
[02:51:06.772 --> 02:51:15.379]  Yeah, I mean, I always tell people there's no accident that the Great Depression and the Roaring Twenties bubble followed the creation of the Federal Reserve.
[02:51:15.379 --> 02:51:17.160]  Because they do the same thing they do.
[02:51:17.160 --> 02:51:22.644]  They go top-down, they don't let the economy rebalance, they kill free market capitalism.
[02:51:22.644 --> 02:51:27.307]  And since the economy doesn't rebalance, you build bigger and bigger bubbles until you have a giant burst.
[02:51:27.307 --> 02:51:29.009]  And that's what we have now in space.
[02:51:29.629 --> 02:51:35.013]  Central banks should only be there for liquidity and emergency situations.
[02:51:35.013 --> 02:51:38.455]  They should not be constantly stimulating the economy.
[02:51:38.455 --> 02:51:40.376]  They're basically like drug pushers.
[02:51:40.376 --> 02:51:47.921]  I hate to say it, but since the 70s, when Keynesian economics became popular, it was invented in the 30s by John Maynard Keynes.
[02:51:47.921 --> 02:51:55.887]  Basically, we've been doing nothing but borrowing, running trade deficits, budget deficits, creating a bigger and bigger bubble, and history's clear on this.
[02:51:55.887 --> 02:51:59.109]  Bubbles always burst, and when they do, you see the worth of time.
[02:52:00.069 --> 02:52:13.435]  That's right, and at least before the central banks took over studying history, there were a lot of bubbles, but they were localized, they were regionalized, and sometimes they would build some infrastructure so when they popped, the only folks getting burned were people that were burned at the end.
[02:52:13.435 --> 02:52:19.378]  Well, that's free market, but now since they prop them up, they get so mega-huge, it engulfs people that weren't even part of them.
[02:52:19.978 --> 02:52:25.620]  Right, and in the capitalist system, the whole point is if you make bad loans, you lose money.
[02:52:25.620 --> 02:52:27.740]  Well, they don't let anybody lose money anymore.
[02:52:27.740 --> 02:52:30.101]  They don't let speculators lose money until it falls off.
[02:52:30.101 --> 02:52:33.502]  They only make us lose money bailing them out, and that's a crime.
[02:52:33.502 --> 02:52:35.302]  HarryDent.com.
[02:52:35.302 --> 02:52:37.223]  We really get hit when the economy collapses.
[02:52:38.932 --> 02:52:42.154]  Well, one thing's for sure, we're in for a wild ride.
[02:52:42.154 --> 02:52:47.618]  This is just the beginning into the slide in my view, and I think Harry Dent's view as well, obviously.
[02:52:47.618 --> 02:52:49.539]  Walt, in Michigan, thanks for holding.
[02:52:49.539 --> 02:52:52.481]  You're on the air with our guest.
[02:52:52.481 --> 02:52:53.322]  Hello, Alex.
[02:52:53.322 --> 02:52:57.925]  I want to point out Revelation chapters 13, 15 through 18.
[02:52:57.925 --> 02:53:00.567]  That's what's going to happen to everybody around the world.
[02:53:00.567 --> 02:53:05.210]  Small and great, rich and poor, free and bond, receive a mark in their right hand or
[02:53:05.743 --> 02:53:06.263]  I think so.
[02:53:28.598 --> 02:53:29.699]  Well, Walt, I know this.
[02:53:29.699 --> 02:53:31.019]  I am a Christian.
[02:53:31.019 --> 02:53:35.122]  It doesn't mean I follow these fake establishment churches that are basically government-run, but I'll tell you this.
[02:53:35.122 --> 02:53:35.982]  This is biblical.
[02:53:35.982 --> 02:53:44.927]  When they want to get rid of cash, have a global superbank, the Pope's endorsing it, carbon taxes, and where you've got to be tracked everything you do.
[02:53:44.927 --> 02:53:50.830]  That sounds like a recipe that would absolutely be loved by any fascist leader.
[02:53:50.830 --> 02:53:55.133]  Your take on the whole move to demonize local farms, local commerce,
[02:53:56.093 --> 02:54:02.855]  Barter, you know, micro economies, lemonade stands, this whole move towards getting rid of cash.
[02:54:02.855 --> 02:54:03.535]  What's behind that?
[02:54:03.535 --> 02:54:13.857]  Well, you know, I mean, this is natural to happen, but when you get deleveraging and the economy breaks down, that's the reason it breaks down.
[02:54:13.857 --> 02:54:21.379]  You can't have real change in reform unless the present structures that have built up for decades, all these special interests,
[02:54:21.960 --> 02:54:25.221]  Unless this breaks down, you can't build out of the ashes again.
[02:54:25.221 --> 02:54:38.825]  So these efforts, like the Chinese to prop up their stock market short term, and people to prop up systems, and to keep printing money to keep the bubble from collapsing, and financial institutions that overlet money, it's not going to work.
[02:54:38.825 --> 02:54:40.745]  It just makes it worse in the long term.
[02:54:40.745 --> 02:54:42.906]  So to me, it's very simple.
[02:54:42.906 --> 02:54:49.128]  The longer this denial, bubble denial, goes on, the worse a crisis we'll have to follow.
[02:54:49.128 --> 02:54:50.428]  Sure, and the centralized
[02:54:51.148 --> 02:55:09.673]  A state-run economy or central bank run economy is in competition with any local economy it doesn't control and so everything's got to get in line and only buy from the central system in its view to prop it up when really all that does is destroy any true grassroots economy that's key during any collapse.
[02:55:10.313 --> 02:55:18.863]  Well, you know, I'll tell you, the worst thing, China is the epitome, like Russia before it, Soviet Union, of a top-down, government-driven economy.
[02:55:18.863 --> 02:55:22.667]  They say it's better, they coordinate everything and people like it at first.
[02:55:22.667 --> 02:55:26.532]  Mark my words, China is going to prove once and for all
[02:55:27.012 --> 02:55:34.638]  That a top-down, centrally-driven economy does not work as well as a bottoms-up, democratic, free-market system.
[02:55:34.638 --> 02:55:37.380]  And democracy, really, Alex, is a bit of socialism.
[02:55:37.380 --> 02:55:43.004]  It balances out capitalism and gives everybody a vote while the rich get richer if they add innovation.
[02:55:43.004 --> 02:55:50.971]  But I'm telling you, China is overexpanded 12 to 15 years in the future, more than any country in history, and they are going to go down.
[02:55:50.971 --> 02:55:52.572]  They're going to fall over like an elephant.
[02:55:52.972 --> 02:55:53.593]  Well, you're right.
[02:55:53.593 --> 02:56:02.342]  The only true socialism is the free market in that it does give everybody a say, but then the socialists actually attack it because they're not even real socialists.
[02:56:02.342 --> 02:56:05.326]  And now you get deep into semantics and what it all means.
[02:56:05.326 --> 02:56:10.972]  HarryDent.com forward slash Alex Jones to find deals on your new best-selling book, The Demographic Cliff.
[02:56:10.972 --> 02:56:13.074]  Thank you so much for spending time with us on Short Notice, sir.
[02:56:13.775 --> 02:56:15.016]  Thank you.
[02:56:15.016 --> 02:56:16.117]  Wow.
[02:56:16.117 --> 02:56:18.699]  I am just basically speechless at this time.
[02:56:18.699 --> 02:56:22.743]  I'm going to do a little bit of overdrive and go to HB.
[02:56:22.743 --> 02:56:23.564]  Truth hung up.
[02:56:23.564 --> 02:56:27.407]  I was going to go back to him and his Jade Helm point.
[02:56:27.407 --> 02:56:30.550]  I see a lot of questions on the board about cash and the FDIC.
[02:56:30.550 --> 02:56:32.111]  I should have gotten to that with Dent.
[02:56:32.111 --> 02:56:35.575]  I forgot to, but next time he's back with us, we'll ask the question.
[02:56:35.575 --> 02:56:36.776]  But I'll say this.
[02:56:38.837 --> 02:56:40.739]  You can just see all of it coming.
[02:56:40.739 --> 02:56:52.952]  I mean, the Pope announcing new world order, global government based on socialism and redistribution of wealth, with the bankers exempt from that and tax exempt, with diplomatic immunity.
[02:56:52.952 --> 02:56:55.956]  I mean, this is a wild time to be alive.
[02:56:55.956 --> 02:56:57.738]  And what happens to this show?
[02:56:59.884 --> 02:57:12.434]  As our credibility just rises and rises and rises, they're running Jade Helm hoaxes, where we're saying martial law is coming in July and August, and that Obama's going to take over Texas.
[02:57:12.434 --> 02:57:13.896]  The Globalist already took over America.
[02:57:13.896 --> 02:57:16.978]  They don't need to take over Texas.
[02:57:16.978 --> 02:57:22.563]  They're just drilling for collapse and the takeover in the future.
[02:57:22.563 --> 02:57:24.164]  And that's admitted in the Army Times.
[02:57:24.164 --> 02:57:25.085]  That's not me.
[02:57:25.085 --> 02:57:27.407]  So you prey on your audience and tell them I'm lying,
[02:57:28.387 --> 02:57:31.775]  But people come and hear what we're really saying and find out you're the big fat liars!

[03:00:01.548 --> 03:00:08.170]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[03:00:08.170 --> 03:00:13.372]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:13.372 --> 03:00:18.373]  We're doing that little dessert of overdrive here.
[03:00:18.373 --> 03:00:24.575]  We're talking to the callers, HB in FEMA Region 4, on mortgages and housing markets.
[03:00:24.575 --> 03:00:28.517]  Sorry Mr. Dent had to go, but what's your take on this?
[03:00:28.517 --> 03:00:28.897]  Hey Alex.
[03:00:30.239 --> 03:00:30.919]  A couple of things.
[03:00:30.919 --> 03:00:38.684]  The fracking issue, I'm not taking joy in all those people losing their jobs, but it's ruining our groundwater terribly.
[03:00:38.684 --> 03:00:39.304]  We don't need it.
[03:00:39.304 --> 03:00:42.146]  We've got so much crude oil around, we don't need fracking.
[03:00:42.146 --> 03:00:47.349]  Mortgages, I'm wondering what's going to happen to all of us mortgage holders when all this finally hits the fan.
[03:00:47.349 --> 03:00:49.951]  Oh, they're still packaging fraudulent loans.
[03:00:49.951 --> 03:00:57.075]  They harass the person doing the borrowing at the grass level, but then above it, the big banks are still reselling them over and over again.
[03:00:58.314 --> 03:01:00.515]  I mean, what's going to happen to us guys where the rubber hits the road?
[03:01:00.515 --> 03:01:03.817]  They're going to kick us out in a month or two, aren't they?
[03:01:03.817 --> 03:01:08.439]  You know, if it gets bad enough, they'll just reduce the rate.
[03:01:08.439 --> 03:01:13.462]  They'll just reduce the payment and the overall bill, the overall note.
[03:01:14.514 --> 03:01:18.676]  That they come up with a computer program that they think will keep you in the house paying the debt.
[03:01:18.676 --> 03:01:22.497]  I mean, I think Dent's right that down the road they're going to not just kick people out of their houses.
[03:01:22.497 --> 03:01:26.299]  But then the globalists hate people so much they might just do that just to destabilize things.
[03:01:26.299 --> 03:01:27.079]  I don't know.
[03:01:27.079 --> 03:01:34.462]  I mean, we're in the hands of people that are militarily conquering us through economic warfare.
[03:01:34.462 --> 03:01:36.183]  We're getting ready to put our house on the market.
[03:01:36.183 --> 03:01:37.243]  I may be a little too late.
[03:01:37.938 --> 03:01:47.838]  But, and that one guy called in and started on the religion thing, I'm still of the mind that they're using the New Testament, that King James and those people rewrote it as a roadmap of what they're going to do to us.
[03:01:47.838 --> 03:01:49.001]  I can't help but get over that.
[03:01:49.369 --> 03:01:51.309]  Well, regardless, they're following it.
[03:01:51.309 --> 03:01:54.670]  So, either the Bible's true or the globalists are following it.
[03:01:54.670 --> 03:01:58.711]  Either way, you know, science fiction a hundred years ago has become reality.
[03:01:58.711 --> 03:02:03.332]  So, humans are made in the image of God that are able to manifest what we envision.
[03:02:03.332 --> 03:02:06.232]  And through the culture, they're manifesting hell on earth.
[03:02:06.232 --> 03:02:08.653]  So, regardless, strap yourselves in.
[03:02:08.653 --> 03:02:10.653]  But good points, HB.
[03:02:10.653 --> 03:02:12.153]  I know this.
[03:02:12.153 --> 03:02:15.794]  I'm going to oppose all this because it's in my bones to oppose it.
[03:02:16.547 --> 03:02:18.308]  Wherever the chips fall.
[03:02:18.308 --> 03:02:19.649]  And I know God's real.
[03:02:19.649 --> 03:02:23.111]  And I know God is not going to recognize me if I'm not fighting this.
[03:02:23.111 --> 03:02:26.432]  But I don't even need to do that to try to get into heaven.
[03:02:26.432 --> 03:02:30.975]  And all heaven is in my gut is not being with the spirit of evil.
[03:02:30.975 --> 03:02:34.577]  You're with a good spirit, God, good creation, love.
[03:02:34.577 --> 03:02:35.997]  It's wonderful.
[03:02:35.997 --> 03:02:38.659]  You're with bad people.
[03:02:39.946 --> 03:02:43.448]  Sounds like a claustrophobic nightmare to me, and I'm ready to die, whatever it takes.
[03:02:43.448 --> 03:02:45.329]  I will never submit to this.
[03:02:45.329 --> 03:02:48.270]  I will never go along with it.
[03:02:48.270 --> 03:02:50.431]  My soul already belongs to God, and that's the end of it.
[03:02:50.431 --> 03:02:52.572]  So, that's what it comes down to.
[03:02:52.572 --> 03:02:56.014]  ET, phoning home from Washington.
[03:02:56.014 --> 03:02:57.935]  You're on the air, go ahead.
[03:02:57.935 --> 03:03:02.217]  Yeah, hey, Alex, just two things.
[03:03:02.217 --> 03:03:06.799]  The first is, today, in the year of our Lord, 1755,
[03:03:11.147 --> 03:03:13.629]  Was Nathan Hale's birthday.
[03:03:13.629 --> 03:03:16.210]  You know who Nathan Will was, was it?
[03:03:16.210 --> 03:03:17.511]  Do you not?
[03:03:17.511 --> 03:03:19.152]  Uh, it rings a bell.
[03:03:19.152 --> 03:03:25.536]  I know that hackers hinted at stock market turmoil hours before Wall Street shut down.
[03:03:25.536 --> 03:03:34.562]  No, Alex, Alex, Nathan said his last words were, I regret that I have but one life to give for my country.
[03:03:34.562 --> 03:03:36.963]  And he was hung by the British.
[03:03:36.963 --> 03:03:38.124]  Oh, yes, yes, yes.
[03:03:39.710 --> 03:03:43.352]  Now, the second thing and the last is NPOG.
[03:03:43.352 --> 03:03:44.412]  A-N-P-O-G.
[03:03:44.412 --> 03:03:48.854]  That's A New Paradigm of Government.
[03:03:48.854 --> 03:03:58.379]  If you type in to your favorite search engine, you'll have two hits and the second one down is the one you want.
[03:03:58.379 --> 03:04:01.220]  It's A New Paradigm of Government.
[03:04:01.220 --> 03:04:05.022]  A-N-P-O-G in parentheses.
[03:04:05.022 --> 03:04:07.443]  And the answer to all of the questions
[03:04:08.072 --> 03:04:15.688]  The answer to all of our frustrations, the answer which was given to us by our founders, is there.
[03:04:18.123 --> 03:04:21.625]  If you go to that website and read it carefully... Alright, I'll check it out, brother.
[03:04:21.625 --> 03:04:23.225]  I'm out of time, unfortunately.
[03:04:23.225 --> 03:04:28.067]  And we'll try to take more calls tomorrow and then right through the weekend on the Sunday show.
[03:04:28.067 --> 03:04:30.749]  This is obviously an amazing time to be alive.
[03:04:30.749 --> 03:04:32.309]  Of course, I know who Nathan Hale is.
[03:04:32.309 --> 03:04:37.792]  He was an intelligence officer and got hung in the famous quote, I regret I have but one life to give to my country.
[03:04:37.792 --> 03:04:40.373]  I get a little exhausted after three hours on air.
[03:04:40.973 --> 03:04:43.155]  Then I'm doing an interview for E!
[03:04:43.155 --> 03:04:48.180]  Radio coming up, so no rest for the... I guess I'm wicked, because there's no rest around here.
[03:04:48.180 --> 03:04:50.061]  Great job with the crew.
[03:04:50.061 --> 03:04:50.742]  Nightly News.
[03:04:50.742 --> 03:04:54.225]  Tonight, I didn't get to see Shari Jackson's piece on the First Amendment.
[03:04:54.225 --> 03:04:54.685]  It's good.
[03:04:54.685 --> 03:04:56.347]  It's up on InfoWars.com.
[03:04:56.347 --> 03:04:57.248]  Be sure and check that out.
