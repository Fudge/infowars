[00:00.000 --> 00:26.000]  It is August 31st. The year is 2020. I'm your host, Alex Jones. I want to thank you all for joining us today.
[00:30.000 --> 00:42.000]  The only way I can start a broadcast is with the truth. And I've started this show hundreds of times this way because it's true.
[00:42.000 --> 00:52.000]  We have just been peaking for 20 years going into the New World Order and now we're getting the peak of the peak of the peak.
[00:52.000 --> 01:02.000]  World governments being announced. Brain chips are being announced. Colleges across the western world are announcing that students will stay in prison cells.
[01:02.000 --> 01:11.000]  Apps will track everything you're doing. Robots will control you. The damn broke and hell came in.
[01:11.000 --> 01:24.000]  And all of it is based on the COVID-19 hoax and it turns out at Davos this year. Some of the top globalists were bragging how they were going to use the virus to bring down the western Trump.
[01:24.000 --> 01:34.000]  It's incredible. But here's what I'm going to start with right now that actually makes me breathless.
[01:34.000 --> 01:53.000]  Makes me have an anxiety attack because we have victory in our hands if we recognize it. But I understand the criminal algorithm that the globalists are involved in.
[01:53.000 --> 02:05.000]  And so I am doing my best here to try to impart to you. So doesn't just get lost in the background noise. How huge this is.
[02:05.000 --> 02:24.000]  The CDC came out this weekend and released data quietly that 90 plus percent of the COVID-19 tests are false positive by design.
[02:24.000 --> 02:39.000]  The clinics across the country and hospitals are faking them to make money. And the big one. Just 6% of COVID deaths occurred without comorbidities like being 85 years old with cancer and heart disease.
[02:39.000 --> 02:45.000]  And then they just put on the death certificate that you died of it. Now we already know all of this.
[02:45.000 --> 02:55.000]  But it's now mainstream news ABC CBS all of it.
[02:55.000 --> 03:03.000]  Fox News. Now how did Trump know what to do to shut down because here's the deal.
[03:03.000 --> 03:11.000]  Fauci and Gates don't engage in fraud. They engage in corporate scams.
[03:11.000 --> 03:20.000]  Fraud is where you get together and you put out fake numbers with a plan to manipulate people and don't tell them.
[03:20.000 --> 03:27.000]  But have you ever noticed in the corporate fraud they have small print at the bottom that actually tells you and that's why small print.
[03:27.000 --> 03:36.000]  They said actually almost no one actually has covered actually everybody really died of other things. And by the way the tests are all basically false positive.
[03:36.000 --> 03:44.000]  They've been saying that from the beginning why do you think Gates came out two months ago and said OK the testings of fraud it's a big problem.
[03:44.000 --> 03:55.000]  And he referred to Roger Stone saying that he was running a scam. And he said other people you know that is.
[03:55.000 --> 04:04.000]  So Gates even goes oh yeah the testings of fraud. So that he's covered later.
[04:04.000 --> 04:13.000]  Remember each other complete garbage when his groups wrote the code for the NIH on what's acceptable and the Wuhan lab controls of the four tests.
[04:13.000 --> 04:19.000]  Two of them. And who's the main financier of the covered lab with U.S. taxpayer money he controls.
[04:19.000 --> 04:28.000]  Bill Gates the third. William Gates. Billy Boy.
[04:28.000 --> 04:38.000]  So if you're not getting chills right now you're absolutely crazy.
[04:38.000 --> 04:44.000]  If you're not absolutely just blown away by this.
[04:44.000 --> 04:50.000]  And if you're not telling everyone you know today about it then you're part of the problem because this covid thing will lock us down forever.
[04:50.000 --> 04:55.000]  It's a civilization killer.
[04:55.000 --> 05:02.000]  I'm not going to lie to you. I want to stay in the fight against Soros and Hillary and the New World Order.
[05:02.000 --> 05:07.000]  And the only way I do is if you buy a lot of products then for short.
[05:07.000 --> 05:21.000]  You got to sell a lot of vitamins and a lot of minerals and a lot of fish oil and a lot of t-shirts and a lot of water filters to fund an operation in the face of the globalist and all the DNC lawsuits but they're so close to losing right now.
[05:21.000 --> 05:28.000]  I go out just like with info and I bring you the very best items, the very best products that I personally use and I love.
[05:28.000 --> 05:38.000]  So go to infowarstore.com, check out the products, get some today, share them with friends, review them and know that you cannot lose because you're funding the info war.
[05:38.000 --> 05:44.000]  Let's fight the globalists. Plus these are great products but I want to thank you for keeping me in the game.
[05:44.000 --> 05:55.000]  I want to thank you for funding our operation so continue to spread the word and fund info wars at infowarstore.com and I salute you once again.
[05:55.000 --> 05:57.000]  Thank you.
[06:26.000 --> 06:29.000]  We lost one of their best members.
[06:29.000 --> 06:45.000]  Execution style Saturday in the communist super state of Portland, Oregon will be joining us along with the best friend, one of the good friends his quote partner of the man that was shot and killed execution style will also be joining us in the third hour.
[06:45.000 --> 06:56.000]  And we'll go over the asinine incredible gas lighting of Joe Biden saying Trump is creating all the violence and anti foot doesn't exist.
[06:56.000 --> 06:59.000]  The corn pop does.
[06:59.000 --> 07:02.000]  So we're going to be looking at all of this coming up the third hour.
[07:02.000 --> 07:11.000]  Now, like I always come up here and I say please pay particular attention to this piece of news I'm covering right now.
[07:11.000 --> 07:17.000]  And it's always very important and it's always ahead of its time from the actual source documents or from sources.
[07:17.000 --> 07:26.000]  And then later everybody sees that I was telling you exactly what was actually going on is my job to not go off with their propaganda is a surface level but to do deep dives.
[07:26.000 --> 07:40.000]  And I can tell you folks, I've not revealed to you a lot of the things I know in the sources I have in the White House, Trump's personal lawyers and others, people you see on the news.
[07:40.000 --> 07:44.000]  People out of New York.
[07:44.000 --> 07:46.000]  This is the real world here.
[07:46.000 --> 07:48.000]  Info Wars is real.
[07:48.000 --> 07:49.000]  You're real.
[07:49.000 --> 07:51.000]  This is really happening.
[07:51.000 --> 07:53.000]  And you don't know how precious you are.
[07:53.000 --> 07:56.000]  It's not just America, but the entire world that you're informed.
[07:56.000 --> 07:57.000]  You care.
[07:57.000 --> 08:08.000]  You're on the field informing Americans in the world about the globalist scourge that will turn the whole planet into a version of communist China 2.0.
[08:08.000 --> 08:10.000]  So I'm not asking you.
[08:10.000 --> 08:15.000]  And I'm not telling you I am just knowing you're going to do it.
[08:15.000 --> 08:29.000]  To tell you however you're listening over the internet audio streams later on this is archived live today on a local radio station TV station to take the feeds from band video and take the feeds from 2020 election center dot com.
[08:29.000 --> 08:32.000]  That's a new URL that gets around the sensors.
[08:32.000 --> 08:38.000]  2020 election center dot com and I'm told we're making a lower third I've been asking for that since Thursday.
[08:38.000 --> 08:41.000]  It says 2020 election center dot com that brings made a really good one.
[08:41.000 --> 08:43.000]  I think we can get that up.
[08:43.000 --> 08:46.000]  I'd actually cut my pinky off for it, but probably won't get it.
[08:46.000 --> 08:49.000]  But the point I'm getting at here, there it is.
[08:49.000 --> 08:50.000]  Oh, I love it.
[08:50.000 --> 08:55.000]  Share it 2020 election center dot com.
[08:55.000 --> 09:01.000]  That URL will take you right to band video and all the sub URLs under that that are not being censored at this time.
[09:01.000 --> 09:03.000]  We're trying to play whack a mole with the enemy.
[09:03.000 --> 09:04.000]  We're the moles.
[09:04.000 --> 09:06.000]  They're trying to whack us.
[09:06.000 --> 09:10.000]  So let me just start over.
[09:10.000 --> 09:12.000]  This broke Friday evening.
[09:12.000 --> 09:14.000]  I didn't know about it till Saturday.
[09:14.000 --> 09:17.000]  I woke up there it was on info wars dot com.
[09:17.000 --> 09:26.000]  Jamie Wyatt written an article about it and linked the Gateway Pundit, who by the way, Gateway Pundit is the best publication now for breaking news.
[09:26.000 --> 09:30.000]  That's stunningly accurate that there is zero hedges number two.
[09:30.000 --> 09:32.000]  There's number, you know, five or six.
[09:32.000 --> 09:36.000]  But our news operation and our live on air analysis is number one.
[09:36.000 --> 09:40.000]  But I just feel good going to sleep at night knowing that there's Jim Hoft.
[09:40.000 --> 09:43.000]  I feel good going to sleep at night knowing there's zero hedge.
[09:43.000 --> 09:45.000]  I feel good going to sleep at night knowing there's Tucker Carlson.
[09:45.000 --> 09:49.000]  Don't you don't you.
[09:49.000 --> 09:52.000]  And all these other incredible people I'm seeing come on the scene.
[09:52.000 --> 09:54.000]  Man, I saw a documentary this morning.
[09:54.000 --> 09:59.000]  But the head of our security sent me that I'm going to tell you about the fourth hour today and I'm going to air 25 minutes long.
[09:59.000 --> 10:06.000]  That is just devastatingly good and devastatingly well spoken and devastatingly accurate.
[10:06.000 --> 10:13.000]  And it just made me feel so good because I'm not trying to be the big number one kahuna.
[10:13.000 --> 10:15.000]  I want to be made obsolete.
[10:15.000 --> 10:18.000]  I want to turn the tide for my children and your children.
[10:18.000 --> 10:24.000]  So let me just get to it right now.
[10:24.000 --> 10:26.000]  I don't want to be the big kahuna but I want to stay on air.
[10:26.000 --> 10:29.000]  I don't want them to win silencing us.
[10:29.000 --> 10:39.000]  And the analogy this morning when I was having a business meeting about how to finance ourselves with my inner circle of crew I trust.
[10:39.000 --> 10:45.000]  One of them said, you know, it's like we're a beach house that's got six legs and they saw it off three of them.
[10:45.000 --> 10:48.000]  And we know they're about to saw off the others and the house is tilting.
[10:48.000 --> 10:52.000]  And it's really there comes a time to tell you what's going on.
[10:52.000 --> 10:55.000]  But for a lot of strategic reasons, it's not time to do that.
[10:55.000 --> 10:57.000]  But let me just explain something to you.
[10:57.000 --> 10:59.000]  I'm not a drama queen.
[10:59.000 --> 11:00.000]  Okay.
[11:00.000 --> 11:04.000]  And if you knew the stuff that they've done to us and if you knew what was going on right now.
[11:04.000 --> 11:15.000]  I'd say it's like the matrix analogy where Neo is in the cyberspace trying to beat, you know, the mainframe Lucifer and they're burrowing into Zion with their big tunnelers.
[11:15.000 --> 11:17.000]  I mean, and they're coming through the wall right now.
[11:17.000 --> 11:20.000]  And I mean, it's just like a movie because movies mirror the real world.
[11:20.000 --> 11:24.000]  It's it's that for real, ladies and gentlemen, every second counts.
[11:24.000 --> 11:26.000]  Everything you do counts now.
[11:26.000 --> 11:30.000]  If I can only tell you what they're doing to Trump behind the scenes and his family and all of his associates.
[11:30.000 --> 11:33.000]  That's why I get so mad at the Q thing.
[11:33.000 --> 11:44.000]  The Democrats still control most of the Justice Department and they are harassing all of Trump supporters at the high level and doing horrible dirty things and Trump's barely winning.
[11:44.000 --> 11:52.000]  And anything that tells you that, oh, everything's fine and that we're not in a serious death battle and that you can just sit back and trust the plan.
[11:52.000 --> 11:56.000]  That's not true. You need to be involved. You need to be engaged.
[11:56.000 --> 11:58.000]  Anybody that tells you not to be is a problem.
[11:58.000 --> 12:00.000]  I don't want to fight with the whole Q thing.
[12:00.000 --> 12:04.000]  There are a good people that buy into it and like riddles and like stuff like that.
[12:04.000 --> 12:06.000]  You don't get that with me.
[12:10.000 --> 12:12.000]  You get the real deal, folks.
[12:12.000 --> 12:16.000]  And that's why we're so attacked because the enemy knows it.
[12:16.000 --> 12:25.000]  Now, when we come back from break, I'm going to shift into the really powerful news that's out in the open, what we told you, the false COVID-19 test and that 90 plus percent of people that die died of something else.
[12:25.000 --> 12:28.000]  The CDC now admits it's all been a fraud.
[12:28.000 --> 12:31.000]  This is huge news, but they're hoping it just blows over.
[12:34.000 --> 12:36.000]  Like a silent but deadly flatulence.
[12:36.000 --> 12:38.000]  That is not the case.
[12:38.000 --> 12:40.000]  This is do or die stuff.
[12:40.000 --> 12:44.000]  I don't hardly ever walk into my writers and my video people and say, you're going to do this.
[12:44.000 --> 12:48.000]  I walked around this morning and I said, you see all this?
[12:48.000 --> 12:50.000]  We broke this this weekend with Gateway Pundit.
[12:50.000 --> 12:52.000]  No one was even going to cover it.
[12:52.000 --> 12:58.000]  I saw disinfo operatives on Twitter Sunday going, this isn't even real.
[12:58.000 --> 13:03.000]  And now it's in the Associated Press that it's all a fraud.
[13:03.000 --> 13:11.000]  But now we have to reverse the fraud, stand up to the fraud, tell all the sheeple that are in limning phase.
[13:11.000 --> 13:16.000]  And then reverse the rollout because this is the civilization killing new order takeover.
[13:16.000 --> 13:21.000]  It's a lot bigger than Trump, though they went ahead and launched it and then pointed it at Trump in America.
[13:21.000 --> 13:23.000]  So that's all coming up.
[13:23.000 --> 13:26.000]  I'm going to go to break and cover this, but let me just tell you this.
[13:29.000 --> 13:31.000]  We're extending for two days and then that's it.
[13:31.000 --> 13:41.000]  The essentials sale with free shipping on eight pack power stack, 60% off with X2 back in stock combo.
[13:41.000 --> 13:44.000]  Heart and body extended wise and vasobesco together so great.
[13:44.000 --> 13:45.000]  These are really strong, great formulas.
[13:45.000 --> 13:52.000]  If you're cardiovascular, your heart and everything else, survival shield X2 and AC9 again back in stock by itself 50% off.
[13:52.000 --> 13:54.000]  Ultimate fish roll back in stock 33% off.
[13:54.000 --> 13:56.000]  It's the highest quality fish roll you're going to find.
[13:56.000 --> 13:58.000]  It's just life changing.
[13:58.000 --> 14:00.000]  Survival shield X2 with X3 combo 50% off.
[14:00.000 --> 14:03.000]  Creel 70% off selling out fast.
[14:03.000 --> 14:08.000]  We got to end this anytime the electric peer breeze 149 four stage ion filter.
[14:08.000 --> 14:09.000]  Last chance to get that.
[14:09.000 --> 14:11.000]  They're almost sold out at that price.
[14:11.000 --> 14:14.000]  That's what they're doing is clearing them out for they get more in.
[14:14.000 --> 14:24.000]  And again, if you don't have storeable food with a world this dangerous and this crazy, you see huge exodus is out of Chicago, huge exodus is out of the East Coast,
[14:24.000 --> 14:32.000]  huge exodus out of the West Coast to the Midwest, to the Southwest, to the South, Texas is mainly everybody's moving to Austin.
[14:32.000 --> 14:38.000]  Certain big podcaster just got here this weekend as the studio fired up down the road for me.
[14:38.000 --> 14:39.000]  It's all going down.
[14:39.000 --> 14:48.000]  But if you don't have God guns, guts and the beans to take care of your family, it won't matter.
[14:48.000 --> 14:52.000]  So a check box you need to get checked off and be prepared to storeable food.
[14:52.000 --> 14:54.000]  We ship now in one to two weeks.
[14:54.000 --> 14:58.000]  We've got the food, but it's got to be packaged, checked on shipped out really everybody's really getting about a week.
[14:58.000 --> 15:00.000]  But we're saying one, two weeks.
[15:00.000 --> 15:01.000]  We under promise over deliver.
[15:01.000 --> 15:07.000]  Get your orders at info or store.com for the best prices, the best packaging, 25 year shelf life.
[15:07.000 --> 15:13.000]  Powered by my page with supply info or store.com or AAA 2533139.
[15:13.000 --> 15:17.000]  And our customer service people, everybody, we're working with them 12 years.
[15:17.000 --> 15:26.000]  They've been around 13 years of the biggest food company now in the world for storeable food because of their quality and because they deliver and because it's amazing.
[15:26.000 --> 15:33.000]  But I would get your storeable food now or you're insane because even if Trump wins, which I believe he will, they're going to contest it.
[15:33.000 --> 15:36.000]  It's going to get crazy and there's going to be inflation in the future.
[15:36.000 --> 15:37.000]  You need insurance.
[15:37.000 --> 15:38.000]  You can eat.
[15:38.000 --> 15:41.000]  So take action now and then fund the info or that's also so critical.
[15:41.000 --> 15:44.000]  If I was you, I'd get your info or products while you still can.
[15:44.000 --> 15:47.000]  There's a chance in a few months we won't be here.
[15:47.000 --> 15:48.000]  It's going to level with you.
[15:48.000 --> 15:49.000]  All right.
[15:49.000 --> 15:50.000]  But this is our last stand.
[15:50.000 --> 15:51.000]  Hopefully we win.
[15:51.000 --> 15:53.000]  But regardless, we're not backing down.
[15:53.000 --> 15:55.000]  I'm going to say something right now.
[15:55.000 --> 15:57.000]  It is one of the most important things I've ever said.
[15:57.000 --> 16:00.000]  So please listen very, very carefully.
[16:00.000 --> 16:06.000]  Donald Trump is not the reason they released COVID or had the lockdown.
[16:06.000 --> 16:10.000]  They already had this plan, the Rockefeller Foundation and Bill of Melinda Gates.
[16:10.000 --> 16:12.000]  It is beyond critical.
[16:12.000 --> 16:15.000]  It is life and death for you and your family to understand.
[16:15.000 --> 16:20.000]  No matter where you live on the planet, but this is a worldwide world government takeover
[16:20.000 --> 16:23.000]  on record that it's never going to end.
[16:23.000 --> 16:27.000]  The United Nations has admitted that first it's a month, then it's six months.
[16:27.000 --> 16:29.000]  Then they say, okay, it's two years.
[16:29.000 --> 16:31.000]  They're now saying two years.
[16:31.000 --> 16:34.000]  They're now saying you'll never go back to normal.
[16:34.000 --> 16:35.000]  No more gatherings.
[16:35.000 --> 16:36.000]  No more anything.
[16:36.000 --> 16:40.000]  Constant force inoculations that they admit don't even work.
[16:40.000 --> 16:43.000]  In the way they say they work, they change your DNA.
[16:43.000 --> 16:46.000]  This is the culling of the planet.
[16:46.000 --> 16:52.000]  This is the beginning of the straight jacket being put on you before you're slowly tortured to death and killed.
[16:52.000 --> 16:53.000]  Do you understand?
[16:53.000 --> 16:55.000]  It was a sleeper product.
[16:55.000 --> 16:57.000]  It wasn't popular at first.
[16:57.000 --> 17:00.000]  But as people tried it, it's become one of our top five best sellers.
[17:00.000 --> 17:03.000]  I'm talking about the eight pack power stack.
[17:03.000 --> 17:08.000]  13 different pills filled with super nutrients, vitamins, minerals and more
[17:08.000 --> 17:11.000]  that you take this morning in one pack and at night.
[17:11.000 --> 17:15.000]  It's available right now at 60% off for a limited time
[17:15.000 --> 17:19.000]  when you get it with Survival Shield X2 that's now back in stock.
[17:19.000 --> 17:22.000]  This has changed my life and so many other people's lives.
[17:22.000 --> 17:23.000]  Now here's the problem.
[17:23.000 --> 17:26.000]  Some of the patented ingredients that are in a pack power stack
[17:26.000 --> 17:31.000]  because of the shutdown and the lockdown are not available for us to even reorder it.
[17:31.000 --> 17:34.000]  So this could be the last shipment that we ever have.
[17:34.000 --> 17:36.000]  It's in stock now.
[17:36.000 --> 17:38.000]  Take advantage of this new combo special.
[17:38.000 --> 17:42.000]  Part of the larger cell we have and free shipping on these cell items
[17:42.000 --> 17:46.000]  like eight pack power stack and X2 at infowarstore.com.
[17:46.000 --> 17:49.000]  Take advantage and get eight pack power stack with X2.
[17:49.000 --> 17:51.000]  60% off and free shipping.
[17:51.000 --> 17:53.000]  Biggest deal on this ever.
[17:53.000 --> 18:03.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[18:23.000 --> 18:34.000]  63 days, 63 days until the most important election in world history.
[18:34.000 --> 18:37.000]  That wasn't hype when I was saying it a year ago and it's not hype now.
[18:37.000 --> 18:41.000]  Now everyone's saying it because it is the truth.
[18:41.000 --> 18:45.000]  All right, you know COVID-19 is an overblown hoax.
[18:45.000 --> 18:50.000]  You know that the globalists are using it to shut down western civilizations
[18:50.000 --> 18:52.000]  while keeping China our main competitors open.
[18:52.000 --> 18:55.000]  You know they're using it to bring in a global digital tracking system
[18:55.000 --> 18:58.000]  and social credit score.
[18:58.000 --> 19:01.000]  But now you've got to make sure other people know it.
[19:01.000 --> 19:04.000]  Now, this morning I went down to the hiking bike trail,
[19:04.000 --> 19:09.000]  walked briskly a couple miles before I jumped into the river
[19:09.000 --> 19:12.000]  and swam about a mile and a half trying to get back in shape.
[19:12.000 --> 19:14.000]  Been working too much.
[19:14.000 --> 19:18.000]  And I probably talked to 20 people.
[19:18.000 --> 19:21.000]  There weren't a lot of folks out there at 7 a.m.
[19:21.000 --> 19:26.000]  And I probably walked by about 40 and about half the people,
[19:26.000 --> 19:31.000]  brown people, white people, old people, young people said,
[19:31.000 --> 19:33.000]  love you Alex Jones, love the work.
[19:33.000 --> 19:36.000]  In fact, they almost all did like a fist but down by their stomach.
[19:36.000 --> 19:38.000]  It was kind of like appreciate you.
[19:38.000 --> 19:39.000]  I was like, this is weird.
[19:39.000 --> 19:41.000]  It's like Fight Club. They're all doing the same thing.
[19:41.000 --> 19:45.000]  And a few of them said F Bill Gates or we're going to get Bill Gates.
[19:45.000 --> 19:48.000]  We're going to get Fauci and his fools.
[19:48.000 --> 19:50.000]  And I was like this is beyond Fight Club.
[19:50.000 --> 19:53.000]  This is the real Fight Club. This is happening.
[19:53.000 --> 19:56.000]  Because I'm like walking along a path, one of the side paths,
[19:56.000 --> 19:57.000]  not the main one.
[19:57.000 --> 20:00.000]  I'm like jumping in the river where nobody's even getting in.
[20:00.000 --> 20:02.000]  You're not supposed to swim in the river.
[20:02.000 --> 20:04.000]  I'll do whatever the hell I want.
[20:04.000 --> 20:05.000]  I'm a wild human.
[20:05.000 --> 20:07.000]  And it was just very exciting.
[20:07.000 --> 20:09.000]  But now is the time to press the attack.
[20:09.000 --> 20:12.000]  I was talking to Darren McBreen who goes into Bucky's,
[20:12.000 --> 20:16.000]  big giant gas stations the size, almost the size of Walmart
[20:16.000 --> 20:17.000]  that started here in Texas.
[20:17.000 --> 20:20.000]  And he said just a month ago, everybody was wearing the mask.
[20:20.000 --> 20:21.000]  Now he said half the people aren't.
[20:21.000 --> 20:23.000]  And the clerks aren't saying anything to you.
[20:23.000 --> 20:26.000]  So again, that's indicative of people knowing the hoax to fraud.
[20:26.000 --> 20:30.000]  A month ago, I'll be on the Hickenback Trail, which they tried to close.
[20:30.000 --> 20:32.000]  And you'd see half the folks wearing masks.
[20:32.000 --> 20:35.000]  Now maybe one in 20 is wearing it and they know they're idiots.
[20:35.000 --> 20:38.000]  So ladies and gentlemen, it's happening.
[20:38.000 --> 20:41.000]  But in lockdown areas like California and New York,
[20:41.000 --> 20:43.000]  it's getting more intense.
[20:43.000 --> 20:46.000]  Instead, people are beating other folks up that don't wear them.
[20:46.000 --> 20:48.000]  Outside.
[20:48.000 --> 20:52.000]  And so the cult there is doubling down, causing a mass exodus,
[20:52.000 --> 20:54.000]  which is fine because the globalists want to collapse the country.
[20:54.000 --> 20:56.000]  That's their mission.
[20:56.000 --> 21:00.000]  So let's go ahead and go over this.
[21:00.000 --> 21:01.000]  This news is so huge.
[21:01.000 --> 21:05.000]  Look at this graph put together with CDC numbers for TV viewers.
[21:05.000 --> 21:10.000]  How misleading raw data can serve to incite panic
[21:10.000 --> 21:15.000]  and to spare the limbing cycle.
[21:15.000 --> 21:19.000]  And they show you what you're told is the case rate.
[21:19.000 --> 21:23.000]  What you're told they projected would be the death rate.
[21:23.000 --> 21:27.000]  And then you've got the actual numbers 90 plus percent lower than what they said.
[21:27.000 --> 21:32.000]  It's actually from the earlier models, 50 plus times lower.
[21:32.000 --> 21:34.000]  That's from the ethical skeptic.
[21:34.000 --> 21:38.000]  Go to their site on Twitter and they show you all the demographics and statistician.
[21:38.000 --> 21:41.000]  We've hired a statistician that has several degrees here in Texas
[21:41.000 --> 21:45.000]  that found the same numbers you've seen us go over those.
[21:45.000 --> 21:48.000]  Now let's get into the real facts here, ladies and gentlemen.
[21:48.000 --> 21:54.000]  CDC says just 6% of COVID deaths occurred without co-morbidities
[21:54.000 --> 21:59.000]  like cancer, heart attacks, average age, 85.
[21:59.000 --> 22:05.000]  Town Hall, oops, looks like the vast majority of positive COVID-19 results should have been negative.
[22:05.000 --> 22:10.000]  Depending on the type of test, they're all between 40 and 99% false,
[22:10.000 --> 22:12.000]  depending on which one you look at.
[22:12.000 --> 22:15.000]  Like some of the tests are supposed to spin it 30 times,
[22:15.000 --> 22:19.000]  but they were having accidents, but always accidents going over.
[22:19.000 --> 22:24.000]  40 times, 100 times, spinning the molecular material.
[22:24.000 --> 22:26.000]  Now let's explain this.
[22:26.000 --> 22:29.000]  Most of these tests don't operate on actually finding the virus.
[22:29.000 --> 22:33.000]  They find what they call wreckage of the virus or antibodies of the virus,
[22:33.000 --> 22:36.000]  but the way they set the test up, it's not even that.
[22:36.000 --> 22:40.000]  And so if you've had a cold, the flu, or a bacterial infection,
[22:40.000 --> 22:43.000]  in the last decade, you're going to be positive.
[22:43.000 --> 22:46.000]  But it turns out most of the companies didn't even do the test.
[22:46.000 --> 22:49.000]  They just saved the money, but said you were positive
[22:49.000 --> 22:53.000]  because the big healthcare providers are in the pocket of the globalist,
[22:53.000 --> 22:57.000]  and they decided to make this move because who sets the parameters?
[22:57.000 --> 23:02.000]  The big central banks, the big think tanks,
[23:02.000 --> 23:07.000]  the big foundations, they create the directives under lockstep and under event 201.
[23:07.000 --> 23:12.000]  That's given to the UN that goes out with those numbers
[23:12.000 --> 23:15.000]  and all the national health services and follow their directive.
[23:15.000 --> 23:18.000]  That's global government through the medical system.
[23:18.000 --> 23:20.000]  And the head of the WHO said last week,
[23:20.000 --> 23:22.000]  we must not allow vaccine nationalism.
[23:22.000 --> 23:26.000]  All countries must go under UN control, 150 who have already done it,
[23:26.000 --> 23:31.000]  and take our directive, and we want forced inoculations by winter.
[23:31.000 --> 23:33.000]  Even if there's not even an approved vaccine,
[23:33.000 --> 23:35.000]  and they admit it's killing folks in the trials.
[23:35.000 --> 23:40.000]  So, look at these numbers, Town Hall,
[23:40.000 --> 23:43.000]  and it goes into the whole thing, how the testings fade.
[23:43.000 --> 23:52.000]  CDC, Axios, 94% of US COVID-19 deaths had contributing health conditions.
[23:52.000 --> 23:55.000]  See, now they're covering their butts, ladies and gentlemen,
[23:55.000 --> 23:58.000]  because they always admitted that the fine print.
[23:58.000 --> 24:00.000]  They didn't totally fraudulently lie.
[24:00.000 --> 24:04.000]  They lied on the news, got the media to lie,
[24:04.000 --> 24:07.000]  ran all these fake headlines, but in the fine print,
[24:07.000 --> 24:11.000]  always admitted it was almost all false positives.
[24:11.000 --> 24:14.000]  CDC, this is out of local 12 news,
[24:14.000 --> 24:20.000]  94% of COVID-19 deaths had underlying medical conditions.
[24:20.000 --> 24:25.000]  ABC News, CDC, 94% of COVID-19 had underlying medical conditions.
[24:25.000 --> 24:27.000]  Now, where did you learn all this?
[24:27.000 --> 24:33.000]  On Saturday and Sunday at infowords.com and gatewaypundit.com.
[24:33.000 --> 24:37.000]  Shock report this week, CDC quietly updated COVID-19 numbers.
[24:37.000 --> 24:44.000]  Only 9,210 Americans died from COVID-19.
[24:44.000 --> 24:46.000]  Rest had different other serious illnesses,
[24:46.000 --> 24:51.000]  or died in car wrecks or gunshot wounds, or drowned.
[24:51.000 --> 24:53.000]  Remember this article last week? We were breaking it.
[24:53.000 --> 24:58.000]  Texas County drops from 4,600 active COVID cases to under 100,
[24:58.000 --> 25:03.000]  admitting that they were given fraudulent data through the federal dashboard
[25:03.000 --> 25:07.000]  that they went and checked it, let the local facilities was not true.
[25:07.000 --> 25:11.000]  infowords.com.
[25:11.000 --> 25:17.000]  With a link to the county of the third most populous in Texas,
[25:17.000 --> 25:23.000]  Collin County that's up in Dallas, they said it's just not true.
[25:23.000 --> 25:26.000]  It was all lies.
[25:26.000 --> 25:28.000]  Oh, but don't worry.
[25:28.000 --> 25:32.000]  Number of COVID-19 cases likely to spike again after testing surge.
[25:32.000 --> 25:37.000]  Hawaii officials warn because they're doing forced testing,
[25:37.000 --> 25:39.000]  stopping people on the highway.
[25:39.000 --> 25:40.000]  Here it is.
[25:40.000 --> 25:44.000]  And making them give the swabs directing them into a tunnel.
[25:44.000 --> 25:47.000]  They wait until you're in a tunnel and they stop you on the main highways
[25:47.000 --> 25:48.000]  and do this.
[25:48.000 --> 25:53.000]  And then they say, oh, the cases are going to explode now
[25:53.000 --> 25:55.000]  because we're going to have all these false positives.
[25:55.000 --> 25:59.000]  They even tell you German COVID civil rights protesters appeal to Donald Trump.
[25:59.000 --> 26:01.000]  Help us.
[26:01.000 --> 26:05.000]  Huge rallies in Germany, huge rallies in Trafalgar Square in London.
[26:05.000 --> 26:09.000]  And the organizer was arrested and given a $10,000 fine,
[26:09.000 --> 26:12.000]  but the Muslims are allowed to do whatever they want.
[26:12.000 --> 26:17.000]  And then we've got this little globalist who chief warns of vaccine nationalism
[26:17.000 --> 26:23.000]  has a hundred to 72 countries sign on to coronavirus vaccine distribution scheme.
[26:23.000 --> 26:27.000]  And they go on to say the UN, here it is, RT, you will take the shots.
[26:27.000 --> 26:28.000]  You will not refuse.
[26:28.000 --> 26:31.000]  The UN is in control.
[26:31.000 --> 26:37.000]  Yeah, of the global fraud, of all the lies, of the forced inoculations all coming.
[26:37.000 --> 26:42.000]  Checkpoints, forced testing, and they're announcing mandatory flu shots
[26:42.000 --> 26:44.000]  already in all the blue states and blue cities.
[26:44.000 --> 26:45.000]  They're coming for you.
[26:45.000 --> 26:47.000]  They want total power over you.
[26:47.000 --> 26:48.000]  They're criminals.
[26:48.000 --> 26:49.000]  They want to bankrupt you.
[26:49.000 --> 26:50.000]  They're the enemy.
[26:50.000 --> 26:52.000]  Destroy them with the truth.
[26:52.000 --> 26:58.000]  Going back more than 20 years ago, I coined the term the false left right paradigm
[26:58.000 --> 27:01.000]  from reading the books by Carol Quigley's, as big as Brzezinski and others,
[27:01.000 --> 27:08.000]  how they described powerful institutions and foundations, successful takeover
[27:08.000 --> 27:13.000]  of the left parties and right parties in Europe and the United States.
[27:13.000 --> 27:16.000]  It didn't mean that those parties didn't have differences before.
[27:16.000 --> 27:18.000]  They were able to get control of the leadership of both
[27:18.000 --> 27:21.000]  and manipulate the public with the illusion of change
[27:21.000 --> 27:25.000]  and the illusion of a fight going on like WWF wrestling or something.
[27:25.000 --> 27:29.000]  With Trump and with our populist movement taking over the Republicans,
[27:29.000 --> 27:31.000]  this is a real populist movement.
[27:31.000 --> 27:33.000]  Doesn't mean it's perfect.
[27:33.000 --> 27:36.000]  And you know it's real because the Democrats, the power structure, the China comms,
[27:36.000 --> 27:41.000]  and the entire old Republican leadership have all endorsed Joe Biden.
[27:41.000 --> 27:42.000]  That's why I'm supporting Trump.
[27:42.000 --> 27:44.000]  It's about Americanism, not globalism.
[27:44.000 --> 27:46.000]  It's about ending the one-sided trade deals,
[27:46.000 --> 27:50.000]  but defending our borders, but defending the right to Second Amendment and pro-life.
[27:50.000 --> 27:52.000]  And Trump's doing all of that.
[27:52.000 --> 27:57.000]  The New World Order is a planetary corporate plan for world government.
[27:57.000 --> 28:00.000]  But world government is only the control grid.
[28:00.000 --> 28:05.000]  Now, inner members of the cult are told that they are going to transcend
[28:05.000 --> 28:08.000]  and become gods and attain immortality.
[28:08.000 --> 28:12.000]  But the price for that is to carry out the orderly extermination
[28:12.000 --> 28:15.000]  of all carbon-based line forms.
[28:15.000 --> 28:17.000]  That's why they say carbon is bad.
[28:17.000 --> 28:21.000]  They are rewriting the entire genetic code of the planet.
[28:21.000 --> 28:23.000]  They are playing God.
[28:23.000 --> 28:27.000]  They believe they have been inspired by interdimensional entities
[28:27.000 --> 28:32.000]  that are giving them advanced technology to carry out this transformation.
[28:32.000 --> 28:34.000]  I know this sounds insane,
[28:34.000 --> 28:38.000]  but if you read the writings of the globalist, it's all on record.
[28:38.000 --> 28:40.000]  You have been warned.
[28:40.000 --> 28:45.000]  You have been given the information to say no to this plan.
[28:45.000 --> 28:48.000]  This is the end of all life on Earth as we know it.
[28:48.000 --> 28:51.000]  This is the alien takeover of Earth.
[28:51.000 --> 28:54.000]  We launched the Everyday Essential Special a week ago.
[28:54.000 --> 28:56.000]  It ends on Monday.
[28:56.000 --> 29:00.000]  That means you've got four days to take advantage of it while I'm cutting the sand.
[29:00.000 --> 29:03.000]  A packed power stack and X2 back in stock.
[29:03.000 --> 29:05.000]  60% off free shipping.
[29:05.000 --> 29:06.000]  Heart and body combo.
[29:06.000 --> 29:07.000]  Extended-wise, vasovies.
[29:07.000 --> 29:09.000]  50% off free shipping.

[29:30.000 --> 29:31.000]  All of internet.
[29:31.000 --> 29:32.000]  Check it out for yourselves.
[29:32.000 --> 29:34.000]  And it funds the info war of 361.
[29:34.000 --> 29:37.000]  The only way you lose is not by taking action.
[29:37.000 --> 29:39.000]  And I want to explain that again.
[29:39.000 --> 29:45.000]  Your support of info wars has stood in defiance of George Soros, the globalist, Hillary and
[29:45.000 --> 29:46.000]  all these comebacks.
[29:46.000 --> 29:47.000]  So great job.
[29:47.000 --> 29:49.000]  You built what we've done.
[29:49.000 --> 29:56.000]  I salute you.
[29:56.000 --> 30:18.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[30:18.000 --> 30:20.000]  Let me tell you what's coming up and who's coming up.
[30:20.000 --> 30:22.000]  And then I want to open the phones up the second hour.
[30:22.000 --> 30:26.000]  But listeners, I've got incredibly important news on so many fronts.
[30:26.000 --> 30:31.000]  But all of it is dwarfed by COVID-19.
[30:31.000 --> 30:37.000]  Because with the COVID-19 hoax, the AI takeover, the driverless cars, locking us in our houses,
[30:37.000 --> 30:42.000]  what they're already beta testing at universities across the United States is incredible.
[30:42.000 --> 30:44.000]  It's moving faster than I thought.
[30:44.000 --> 30:46.000]  I'm going to show you the articles in a moment.
[30:46.000 --> 30:54.000]  Remember two weeks ago in Europe, in the UK, in the US and Canada, in California, in Michigan,
[30:54.000 --> 31:02.000]  in Toronto, in London, in Berlin, in Reykjavik, I saw they were doing it in Greenland or Iceland,
[31:02.000 --> 31:03.000]  wherever that's at.
[31:03.000 --> 31:10.000]  They are saying you can't leave the campus and there's an app on your phone for contact
[31:10.000 --> 31:15.000]  tracing and they tell you what shops to go to and where you're allowed to shop and who
[31:15.000 --> 31:19.000]  can go where when.
[31:19.000 --> 31:22.000]  That's the total Chinese Communist Social Score.
[31:22.000 --> 31:30.000]  Well now, they're announcing prison pods where you're actually going to a locker.
[31:30.000 --> 31:36.000]  That's what the CIA would use to torture you with and you lock yourself in to a locker
[31:36.000 --> 31:42.000]  in the dark with a TV screen, but you're still in the classroom.
[31:42.000 --> 31:47.000]  I mean, it's all about, okay, stand on your head, okay, stand on one leg and stick your
[31:47.000 --> 31:48.000]  thumb up your ear in.
[31:48.000 --> 31:52.000]  Okay, now, you know, play twisters.
[31:52.000 --> 31:56.000]  I mean, it's stick your finger in a light socket.
[31:56.000 --> 31:58.000]  That's what cults get you to do.
[31:58.000 --> 32:01.000]  They get you to do stupid stuff.
[32:01.000 --> 32:04.000]  All I want you to do is wake up and take action and love God.
[32:04.000 --> 32:07.000]  These people want to destroy you.
[32:07.000 --> 32:10.000]  It's a cult.
[32:10.000 --> 32:14.000]  Because people want to feel like they're part of something and your heroes and all the big
[32:14.000 --> 32:17.000]  corporations say just wear your mask.
[32:17.000 --> 32:19.000]  Just wear your mask.
[32:19.000 --> 32:21.000]  Be a hero.
[32:21.000 --> 32:25.000]  And it's all a fraud and they weren't going to have any COVID death numbers.
[32:25.000 --> 32:35.000]  So they sent people with COVID-19 to the nursing homes and COVID-19 is a bad pneumonia.
[32:35.000 --> 32:38.000]  COVID-19 is a patented chimera that Bill Gates owns.
[32:38.000 --> 32:40.000]  So it's a real virus.
[32:40.000 --> 32:43.000]  And if you've got a vitamin or nutrient deficiency, it can kill you.
[32:43.000 --> 32:45.000]  Any other virus can as well.
[32:45.000 --> 32:47.000]  Most people don't ever die of what they call starvation.
[32:47.000 --> 32:49.000]  They die of malnutrition.
[32:49.000 --> 32:55.000]  And then they get a regular cold that most people wouldn't even get sick from and you die.
[32:55.000 --> 33:03.000]  And so you look at 44% of the people died in nursing homes.
[33:03.000 --> 33:06.000]  And starting three months ago, they froze the numbers.
[33:06.000 --> 33:10.000]  So the FBI is investigating 10 Democrat governors right now.
[33:10.000 --> 33:15.000]  You saw they sent the letters out last week to five of them, but it's more than those five.
[33:15.000 --> 33:20.000]  Saying, hold on to your data and give it to us because they're not reporting it federally like they're
[33:20.000 --> 33:25.000]  supposed to because the word I've got is something like 60%.
[33:25.000 --> 33:27.000]  I've got this out of New York from law enforcement.
[33:27.000 --> 33:35.000]  They're looking at 60% of the deaths were 85 or older in nursing homes.
[33:35.000 --> 33:40.000]  Unbelievable, ladies and gentlemen, unbelievable.
[33:40.000 --> 33:44.000]  And they did the same thing in Italy first and the same thing was done in China.
[33:44.000 --> 33:50.000]  They're doing this as a test, a dry run to kill old people like Bill Gates wants to do to euthanize them,
[33:50.000 --> 33:55.000]  get away with it and then use their dead numbers to scare the living hell out of us.
[33:55.000 --> 33:57.000]  I'm explaining this again.
[33:57.000 --> 33:58.000]  Old people are inside.
[33:58.000 --> 33:59.000]  They're not getting sun.
[33:59.000 --> 34:00.000]  You don't have D3.
[34:00.000 --> 34:01.000]  You will die from it.
[34:01.000 --> 34:06.000]  Any regular virus, even ones that aren't closely lethal will kill you.
[34:06.000 --> 34:11.000]  So they start there and then old people's guts stop absorbing nutrients.
[34:11.000 --> 34:16.000]  So old people need a higher regimen of vitamins and minerals because their guts get old and they stop absorbing
[34:16.000 --> 34:18.000]  upper and lower intestine.
[34:18.000 --> 34:23.000]  That's all mainline science and they knew all this and they suppressed this.
[34:23.000 --> 34:27.000]  But nursing homes on average care about their people and I know people that work at nursing homes,
[34:27.000 --> 34:34.000]  people that run them, they are on their own money getting zinc and D3 and giving it to these old people
[34:34.000 --> 34:36.000]  because they care about them.
[34:36.000 --> 34:37.000]  And guess what?
[34:37.000 --> 34:38.000]  You're not getting to kill them.
[34:38.000 --> 34:40.000]  You murderers.
[34:40.000 --> 34:42.000]  You murdering Fauci.
[34:42.000 --> 34:44.000]  You murder Bill Gates.
[34:44.000 --> 34:46.000]  You murdering piece of garbage.
[34:46.000 --> 34:50.000]  Now, do you think Bill Gates gets daily reports on what I say?
[34:50.000 --> 34:53.000]  And Jeff Bezos gets daily reports, transcripts of what I say.
[34:53.000 --> 34:54.000]  I'm going to stop right there.
[34:54.000 --> 34:56.000]  I'm barred from saying anymore.
[34:56.000 --> 34:57.000]  I'm going to stop right there.
[34:57.000 --> 34:59.000]  I'm going to stop right there.
[34:59.000 --> 35:02.000]  Boy, I sure wish I could tell you all this, folks.
[35:02.000 --> 35:11.000]  I've been told by Gates's representatives before this even happened in meetings in D.C.
[35:11.000 --> 35:13.000]  that if I don't shut up, I'm dead.
[35:13.000 --> 35:16.000]  Will you go ahead and do it then, Billy boy?
[35:16.000 --> 35:18.000]  F you.
[35:18.000 --> 35:22.000]  But I just want listeners to know this is the real show.
[35:22.000 --> 35:23.000]  This is the real broadcast.
[35:23.000 --> 35:27.000]  And not because I'm here pissing at you, telling you I'm Mr. Billy Badass.
[35:27.000 --> 35:32.000]  You need to know.
[35:32.000 --> 35:38.000]  This is out in the light in front of God and country and my family.
[35:38.000 --> 35:41.000]  We can beat these monsters.
[35:41.000 --> 35:48.000]  And I'm way more willing to die for the truth than I am to live on my knees to these people.
[35:48.000 --> 35:52.000]  So I'm just going to tell you something right now.
[35:52.000 --> 35:54.000]  We're winning and they're scared.
[35:54.000 --> 35:56.000]  I'm going to leave it at that.
[35:56.000 --> 36:01.000]  They are crying uncle right now and just begging us to stop.
[36:01.000 --> 36:02.000]  And I guess what?
[36:02.000 --> 36:03.000]  I'm not going to stop.
[36:03.000 --> 36:05.000]  And if you kill me, it'll make it even bigger.
[36:05.000 --> 36:08.000]  But if you want to go ahead and pull the trigger, do it, Bill.
[36:08.000 --> 36:09.000]  Do it.
[36:09.000 --> 36:10.000]  Do it.
[36:10.000 --> 36:11.000]  Do it.
[36:11.000 --> 36:13.000]  I'm not a sack of crap like you, boy.
[36:13.000 --> 36:15.000]  I don't get off on killing people.
[36:15.000 --> 36:19.000]  It's the last thing I do even after I'm shoveled in my grave.
[36:19.000 --> 36:23.000]  My spirit will live on through the people and you will pay.
[36:23.000 --> 36:25.000]  You will pay.
[36:25.000 --> 36:28.000]  So I'm sorry.
[36:28.000 --> 36:29.000]  I'm digressing here.
[36:29.000 --> 36:32.000]  Let's get into some of the news right here.
[36:32.000 --> 36:40.000]  How misleading raw data can serve to incite panic and despair.
[36:40.000 --> 36:47.000]  And so you have the lemming cycle, increased testing, increased cases, panic, demand more testing.
[36:47.000 --> 36:49.000]  And now it's not about deaths.
[36:49.000 --> 36:51.000]  It's not about even getting a fever.
[36:51.000 --> 36:59.000]  It's about increased testing, increased cases, panic, demand more testing.
[36:59.000 --> 37:03.000]  Increased testing, increased cases, panic, demand more testing.
[37:03.000 --> 37:12.000]  Increased cases, increased testing, increased cases, panic, demand more testing.
[37:12.000 --> 37:15.000]  And that's why you see the same propaganda record number of tests.
[37:15.000 --> 37:17.000]  Oh, how this town did a good job, but didn't.
[37:17.000 --> 37:18.000]  And then they got sick.
[37:18.000 --> 37:23.000]  Oh, I locked down and didn't have any cases, but now they're the epicenter of the outbreak.
[37:23.000 --> 37:30.000]  Thousands of tests today, thousands of new people because it's a fake test, but there's no deaths.
[37:30.000 --> 37:33.000]  We had a journalist in here yesterday, Jason Jones, and he had the numbers.
[37:33.000 --> 37:39.000]  I didn't even know it was.0004.
[37:39.000 --> 37:44.000]  That's thousands of times less legal than the flu.
[37:44.000 --> 37:45.000]  And why?
[37:45.000 --> 37:48.000]  Because Hawaiians are in the sun.
[37:48.000 --> 37:54.000]  And baby, if you got a tan from the sun, you're in like Flynn.
[37:54.000 --> 37:58.000]  If you got the zinc and if you got the C.
[37:58.000 --> 37:59.000]  It's a fact.
[37:59.000 --> 38:00.000]  And I just keep saying that.
[38:00.000 --> 38:04.000]  But remember, oh, the UN has not said vitamin D3 is good or zinc.
[38:04.000 --> 38:06.000]  Oh, no, just the NIH website.
[38:06.000 --> 38:12.000]  That's why when you're a kid watching, you know, commercials for crappy sugar cereal, it goes, oh, but we add 30 vitamins
[38:12.000 --> 38:16.000]  and minerals that are essential.
[38:16.000 --> 38:23.000]  Because you can eat crappy sugar cereal and live off that because it has all the essential vitamins and minerals.
[38:23.000 --> 38:26.000]  Essential vitamins and minerals.
[38:26.000 --> 38:32.000]  Essential, essential, essential, essential, essential, essential, essential, essential, essential, essential, essential.
[38:32.000 --> 38:34.000]  And I sit there and I talk to people wearing masks in public.
[38:34.000 --> 38:36.000]  I go, listen, I'll get to have zinc D3 and see.
[38:36.000 --> 38:44.700]  three and see they go, oh, are you a doctor? I go, is Bill Gates one? They plan to never
[38:44.700 --> 38:49.440]  take the mask off. Fauci says, we're goggles. It's all Kabuki theater to go. Oh, you want
[38:49.440 --> 38:54.100]  to take the mask off? Oh, no, actually, the governor of Texas says, wear it in your house
[38:54.100 --> 38:59.980]  when you're having sex with your husband or wife. Put it on. What a frickin cult of lying
[38:59.980 --> 39:08.880]  cokes. They told us four percent of us were going to die. And it's nationwide with fake
[39:08.880 --> 39:19.280]  numbers added point zero, zero, three, two. And in Hawaii and Australia, there's four
[39:19.280 --> 39:25.640]  zeros before you even get to, I mean, you understand, these aren't zeros in the positive
[39:25.640 --> 39:33.080]  direction. They're zeros in the fraction direction. Oh my God. Let me go through this whole stack
[39:33.080 --> 39:36.720]  when we come back and then I'll get into all the other news and I mean, stuff breaking
[39:36.720 --> 39:42.920]  Fox News reporting on what we told you was in zero hedge and in four years ago. Remember
[39:42.920 --> 39:51.160]  all that about Obama's Ministry of Truth? Remember all that Obama's Ministry of Truth?
[39:51.160 --> 39:55.840]  This isn't about me taking credit. In fact, it's the opposite. It's about getting you
[39:55.840 --> 40:00.440]  to understand that you have all the power. Going back three weeks ago, they had the entire
[40:00.440 --> 40:06.040]  Austin Greenbelt shutdown and they have the spillway by Barton Springs shutdown as well
[40:06.040 --> 40:11.400]  as the main pool that's always been paid for the last 50 years or so. It's a damned
[40:11.400 --> 40:17.760]  up spring. Well, we went down there and we got in the park at different areas around
[40:17.760 --> 40:23.560]  town in the last few weeks and educated people that it was all a giant fraud. And now, despite
[40:23.560 --> 40:27.280]  the fact that they still say the parks are closed, you get out to any area. You'll see
[40:27.280 --> 40:32.000]  dozens if not hundreds of people depending where you're at actually using Barton Springs
[40:32.000 --> 40:37.040]  here in Austin, Texas. So Bill Gates and the globalists give the orders to the UN. The
[40:37.040 --> 40:42.040]  UN gives the orders down through the National Health Services like our NIH and we all follow
[40:42.040 --> 40:47.600]  it like dutiful slaves. Stop complying with your own enslavement. Stop following the
[40:47.600 --> 40:54.600]  orders of these globalist traders. Start being free again.
[41:17.600 --> 41:24.600]  We are effective. The great awakening is here. Go to band.video. Download the videos and

[42:01.200 --> 42:07.160]  civil war is coming and financial collapse and planetary lockdowns using viruses. And
[42:07.160 --> 42:11.560]  he tells people they should get off the grid and get prepared and have horrible food if
[42:11.560 --> 42:16.720]  they can. And now everything I've warned people about is coming true because it was all in
[42:16.720 --> 42:23.040]  the rockfeller foundation documents like lockstep. This is the corporate planetary takeover.
[42:23.040 --> 42:27.960]  So yes, I stand by what I said 10 years ago, what I said a year ago, and what I said last

[44:18.080 --> 44:31.400]  I'm going to put a gun in my head and say, serve my evil or I'll kill you. And I'd say
[44:31.400 --> 44:37.520]  you pull that trigger, you coward little rat. Not because I want to die, but because I want
[44:37.520 --> 44:42.880]  everybody to live. And we can't bow to these tyrants and have a free nation, a free world.
[44:42.880 --> 44:47.320]  The essence of who we are is standing on the shoulders of those that had the attitude of
[44:47.320 --> 44:55.080]  not being cowards and standing up to trash. I've never seen such trash as those globalist
[44:55.080 --> 44:59.720]  population meetings they have with all these old weird, inbred, unhappy people that hate
[44:59.720 --> 45:04.040]  themselves and hate humanity, who could actually empower humanity with their wealth and power,
[45:04.040 --> 45:10.360]  but their very nature won't allow them to do it. Now, the folks that did the best job
[45:10.360 --> 45:14.040]  reporting on this, we wrote a bunch of articles, we've done countless reports on it, with zero
[45:14.040 --> 45:21.240]  heads. They wrote probably 10 articles about it in 2016, 2017. This is coming up next hour.
[45:21.240 --> 45:26.520]  Obama quietly signs the countering disinformation and propaganda act, which turned the CIA and
[45:26.520 --> 45:34.720]  DARPA loose with all these different computer programs and systems developed by DARPA, with
[45:34.720 --> 45:39.800]  General McChrystal and all of it, on to the American people. And you also saw the headline
[45:39.800 --> 45:46.800]  in 2014 out of Foreign Affairs and in other publications with the Washington Post, Obama
[45:46.800 --> 45:53.240]  legalizes using propaganda on Americans. And they actually got the Defense Authorization
[45:53.240 --> 45:57.440]  Act to pass a law saying they could now use disinfo on the American people. It was already
[45:57.440 --> 46:02.680]  going on, but they just legalized Operation Mockingbird. So there was that article, but
[46:02.680 --> 46:08.640]  here's this, look at this. DIMMS deploying DARPA-funded AI-driven information warfare
[46:08.640 --> 46:15.120]  tool to target pro-Trump accounts. And that's who goes through for Google, Apple and all
[46:15.120 --> 46:19.680]  of them. We told you about this years ago, but now they're in the news admitting that
[46:19.680 --> 46:24.480]  DARPA created software. This is what William Benning and others exposed to years ago is
[46:24.480 --> 46:32.480]  being used. So that's what's going on. And that's why I've screamed at Pompeii on air
[46:32.480 --> 46:37.040]  and all the rest of it, because it's not just the computer programs. It's House Armed Services
[46:37.040 --> 46:42.280]  Committee hearings where they say, Jones is a Russian agent. We're doing countermeasures
[46:42.280 --> 46:46.720]  against him. And so is Roger Stone. And then they go have the FBI come after us, telling
[46:46.720 --> 46:51.200]  them, oh yeah, we're green lit at the national security level. These are Russian assets,
[46:51.200 --> 46:58.040]  boulder dash. You're CHICOM agents. We're very glad Russia's becoming Christian and
[46:58.040 --> 47:01.920]  getting away from the new old order. Bravo. Hope everybody breaks free from it. That's
[47:01.920 --> 47:07.480]  about as Russian as we get. If the Russians were up our business like the CHICOMs, I'd
[47:07.480 --> 47:14.200]  say go after them. They're not. So these are globalists that are anti-American that are
[47:14.200 --> 47:18.000]  selling the country out. My God, they fund anti-fasorist. They say no borders, no wall,
[47:18.000 --> 47:25.360]  no USA at all. The new stuff they do is they're now chanting death to America. We got that
[47:25.360 --> 47:30.320]  all coming up third hour with Joe Egyptian and the man who died, the best buddy who was
[47:30.320 --> 47:35.680]  there when he was killed an eyewitness. But the Portland news is still, we don't know if
[47:35.680 --> 47:39.560]  it was political or not. They just said, we got a tropper. Here's a tropper. Get him.
[47:39.560 --> 47:48.720]  Pull it out. Boom, boom. You got eyewitnesses. You got, people said did it.
[47:48.720 --> 47:52.960]  Even local news says that the man is a person of interest and they're looking for him right
[47:52.960 --> 47:58.960]  now. It's all coming up, ladies and gentlemen, but just incredible times. But let me just
[47:58.960 --> 48:04.880]  get back to this because this is a live show. We're going to archive this later and we're
[48:04.880 --> 48:08.720]  going to do some, Greg Reese is great. The brain's great. We probably need some four
[48:08.720 --> 48:13.720]  minute, five minute, Harrison's awesome, Wilson's, all our editors are amazing, but
[48:13.720 --> 48:17.560]  somebody needs to just do their own voice over their own like four minute with the COVID
[48:17.560 --> 48:25.440]  collapse has officially collapsed. The entire COVID hoax and I want to be clear. The virus
[48:25.440 --> 48:32.640]  itself is not a hoax. I mean, you could kill yourself with a pencil. You just don't call
[48:32.640 --> 48:42.000]  it a thermonuclear warhead. It's a very easily spread pneumonia style virus. It's a chimera
[48:42.000 --> 48:47.520]  and does some weird mutations and really goes after people that are old, but still it's
[48:47.520 --> 48:52.120]  less than one hundredth of a percent chance of dying from it. I mean, it's, it's not
[48:52.120 --> 48:58.720]  one in a hundred, one one hundredth of a percent or less. I mean, it's super weak.
[48:58.720 --> 49:03.040]  The flu now, first they were like, Oh, the flu is five times worse, three times worse.
[49:03.040 --> 49:09.960]  It's like 50 times worse. And notice they fetishize it now. They're saying, Oh, flu
[49:09.960 --> 49:13.680]  shots are going to be mandatory. All the Democrat states are saying, because, you know, it actually
[49:13.680 --> 49:18.520]  kills people. So if we're going to do all this for COVID-19, absolutely fricking loopy.
[49:18.520 --> 49:22.880]  What are they going to do for one point four million people died of tuberculosis last year
[49:22.880 --> 49:29.360]  in the U S one point four million? That's real people. A lot of them kids. Nobody wanted
[49:29.360 --> 49:33.600]  to test folks coming into Latin America with it. Nobody wanted to check kids in school next
[49:33.600 --> 49:43.680]  to your kids and entire take care of the kids that already had it. And it's incredible.
[49:43.680 --> 49:47.120]  One point four million. Oh, but that's with open borders. So they didn't want you to know
[49:47.120 --> 49:53.840]  about that. And then 180,000, 94% of them didn't die from COVID. That's why they're
[49:53.840 --> 50:01.080]  saying 10,000 people, 9,000 and change 9,000 died from COVID. If you actually look at the
[50:01.080 --> 50:06.240]  real numbers and that sounds believable. I mean, my God, don't play around with pneumonia.
[50:06.240 --> 50:11.920]  I told you, I lost six years ago. My uncle, my dad's older cousin, he called his uncle
[50:11.920 --> 50:16.400]  and my cousin, they all lived in the same ranch, different ranch houses up on the hill.
[50:16.400 --> 50:19.760]  We still got the remnants of our beautiful ranch was big hill, big oak trees all around
[50:19.760 --> 50:28.520]  it. Look at all the directions. Beautiful. And they all died one month, one after the
[50:28.520 --> 50:39.440]  other, my cousin, my uncle, and then Pat Lynn, my dad's cousin, all great man, all dead.
[50:39.440 --> 50:47.000]  And I went to that hospital in East Texas. And I saw them loading body bags in amulets
[50:47.000 --> 50:53.400]  lined up. They were dead people all over the place. Didn't hear about on the news folks.
[50:53.400 --> 50:56.880]  When there's a real epidemic, you're not going to hear about it. He heard about it on this
[50:56.880 --> 51:00.960]  show. Believe me, if there's a real epidemic, I will tell you, you'll already know it because
[51:00.960 --> 51:07.000]  you'll already see yourself. No, this was an economic weapon and a system to bring in
[51:07.000 --> 51:11.880]  the AI controls. And we now know that. So let's run through these headlines very quickly.
[51:11.880 --> 51:21.320]  CDC, 6% of COVID deaths occurred without comorbidities. Oops, looks like the vast majority of positive
[51:21.320 --> 51:27.920]  COVID-19 results have been negative. AP town hall Reuters are all reporting ABC News, Axios,
[51:27.920 --> 51:36.000]  CDC, 94% of US COVID deaths and contributing health conditions. And it goes on ABC News,
[51:36.000 --> 51:40.880]  all of it the same thing. Shock report this week, CDC quietly upended COVID-19 numbers.
[51:40.880 --> 51:45.640]  Only 9,200 Americans died from COVID-19. See, there's alternative media breaking it all
[51:45.640 --> 51:52.640]  first. Gateway funded info wars. In force last week, when the state got the new numbers
[51:52.640 --> 51:58.200]  and looked at it and said, my God, we had 4,600 cases. We did the audit. It was all fake less
[51:58.200 --> 52:04.160]  than 100. Unbelievable. But don't worry. They have checkpoints in Hawaii run by the Democrats
[52:04.160 --> 52:08.320]  under UN control to set the precedent to make us be like Australia or Spain that are living
[52:08.320 --> 52:12.360]  in a nightmare. Here's the article I told you about zero hedge.com.
[52:12.360 --> 52:18.160]  Senate to isolation prisons, college students across America are being subjected to hard
[52:18.160 --> 52:22.600]  psychological experiment. Yeah, like the Milgram or the Stanford to see what they'll put up
[52:22.600 --> 52:27.200]  with. And they admit it's being run by psychiatrists and psychologists to just see what you'll
[52:27.200 --> 52:34.160]  put up with. It's all made up. And German COVID civil rights protesters appeal to Trump
[52:34.160 --> 52:38.000]  for help. Yes, we need Trump who's already leading on this to go public with it, to not
[52:38.000 --> 52:44.080]  just expose the numbers and say it's a fraud, but to absolutely destroy it. And again, the
[52:44.080 --> 52:49.480]  response to COVID is the hoax. Yes, it's overblown. Do pencils kill people? Yes. Is it a hydrogen
[52:49.480 --> 52:56.200]  bomb? No. And they got the UN telling you, you will submit to this. The UN is in charge
[52:56.200 --> 53:02.360]  of all of it. Unbelievable. Oh, but in New Jersey, finally reopens indoor dining, but
[53:02.360 --> 53:08.760]  once you to give your name and number and info, you ready for contact tracing app?
[53:08.760 --> 53:14.080]  It's all coming up, ladies and gentlemen, in the next hour. But I wanted to spend this
[53:14.080 --> 53:17.640]  hour on this fact because I know you've already heard it a thousand times. You looked it up
[53:17.640 --> 53:23.720]  yourself. You know, I'm telling you the truth. I get that. Now I need you to take this information
[53:23.720 --> 53:28.840]  and to get it out to people. And if that means you go get a YouTube channel and talk about
[53:28.840 --> 53:34.000]  it, that's the answer. We don't need you to sit back and wait for Alex Jones to do it.
[53:34.000 --> 53:39.280]  We need you to do it. And I'm seeing a huge new crop, the biggest crop of people I've
[53:39.280 --> 53:43.680]  ever seen come out for freedom and come out against the new order. And really this COVID
[53:43.680 --> 53:48.240]  thing has caused a crash course. And now suddenly people have gone from knowing nothing to having
[53:48.240 --> 53:52.880]  PhD level understanding of this. And I love it. Love it. Because I always had this vision
[53:52.880 --> 53:56.560]  that my job was to wait as many people as possible and that that would cause and trigger
[53:56.560 --> 54:02.160]  the great awakening for the leaders and that I could then just recede. And I'm now seeing
[54:02.160 --> 54:05.800]  the literally the vision God gave me. I like sitting there, you know, hallucinating, but
[54:05.800 --> 54:10.720]  like just an understanding when I was about 16 or 17 was like beaming to me like this is
[54:10.720 --> 54:14.960]  going on. You got to warn people, world government, new world order, the plan. And I just saw
[54:14.960 --> 54:18.760]  it all. And I was like, you have to do this. You have to do this. You're going to go warn
[54:18.760 --> 54:21.800]  people. Then they're going to listen. You're going to get destroyed in the process. It's
[54:21.800 --> 54:27.720]  okay. Do it. Do it. Do it. Attack, attack, attack, attack. And I mean, God is so real.
[54:27.720 --> 54:32.640]  This wasn't me. And now here we are 30 years later and it's all unfolding. Praise Jesus.
[54:32.640 --> 54:42.120]  Well, they ride back, let's you tell them what I ordered. I love it.
[54:42.120 --> 54:46.520]  The Democrats are just going more and more left. Many positive about socialism, liking
[54:46.520 --> 54:52.000]  it more than capitalism. Many of the ideas we fought for that were considered radical
[54:52.000 --> 54:58.800]  on now mainstream. The radical left has taken over the Democratic Party and Joe Biden is
[54:58.800 --> 55:04.000]  marching in lockstep with them. Biden and the far left are promising to crush middle
[55:04.000 --> 55:08.960]  class families with trillions in new taxes. If you elect me, your taxes are going to be
[55:08.960 --> 55:15.040]  raised, not cut. Promising amnesty and healthcare for 11 million illegal immigrants. Citizens
[55:15.040 --> 55:20.560]  shift for 11 million undocumented folks. Promising to shut down energy exploration,
[55:20.560 --> 55:26.360]  killing jobs and hurting America's economy. I guarantee we're going to get fossil fuel.
[55:26.360 --> 55:32.520]  In Joe Biden's America, the radical left get whatever they want and you get to pay for
[55:32.520 --> 55:38.120]  it. They've already taken over Joe Biden and the Democratic Party. Don't let them take
[55:38.120 --> 55:46.600]  over America. I don't have to tell you that fish oil is
[55:46.600 --> 55:51.240]  known to be so good for your brain, so good for your heart, so good for your cells, your

[56:45.320 --> 57:14.320]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show. How big was it Friday when the chairman of the
[57:14.320 --> 57:19.960]  Joint Chiefs of Staff Millie came out and said, the Democrats have asked us to carry
[57:19.960 --> 57:27.000]  out a coup. It actually got a group actively trying to prepare it, saying that if Trump
[57:27.000 --> 57:32.640]  contests the election, which Hillary says she will, Biden's her puppet, that Trump
[57:32.640 --> 57:38.240]  needs to be struck by the military because he's an enemy agent working with Russians.
[57:38.240 --> 57:46.840]  We're back to that again. Oh, yeah, right. Trump's with the Russians. Sure. Anyways,
[57:46.840 --> 57:53.120]  I'm only laughing because this has been a long, hard fight and with the COVID hoax being
[57:53.120 --> 57:59.320]  exposed and I just, at a spiritual level, I feel victory right now. And this is a buildup
[57:59.320 --> 58:04.400]  to train humanity for the big push against AI and our power is going to become so great
[58:04.400 --> 58:08.280]  with the science God's given us that we're going to have some bigger obstacles to come.
[58:08.280 --> 58:12.880]  But I mean, maybe two big humps, like we've already climbed one mountain, you get to the
[58:12.880 --> 58:17.680]  top, you see a bigger mountain and a bigger mountain. I'd say about two more humps. I
[58:17.680 --> 58:22.840]  don't know if it takes 20 years, 100 years, but I mean, humanity's going straight up.
[58:22.840 --> 58:29.240]  And people read the Bible and the church teaches, oh, we're going to the Danny Chrysler
[58:29.240 --> 58:33.360]  wage war on the saints and overcome them. That's in one big battle. And then he gets
[58:33.360 --> 58:38.640]  like maybe a year to run around slaughtering everybody who deserves it. A bunch of Satanist.
[58:38.640 --> 58:45.720]  I mean, the devil's going to start just wiping out all his minions and then get his ass fried.
[58:45.720 --> 58:49.840]  And when you study gates of these Luciferians, man, they're getting directives from this
[58:49.840 --> 58:55.480]  off world crap. When I say off world, it didn't come from this world. Not of this world, but
[58:55.480 --> 59:00.360]  the God of this world, little G. And so yeah, it's super heavy. It's super real. None of
[59:00.360 --> 59:06.680]  them are atheist. None of them. They admit that now. Let's, let's, let's go to Greg
[59:06.680 --> 59:10.000]  Reese's report and we'll be right back.
[59:10.000 --> 59:15.840]  Mainstream media is reporting that the most senior officer in the US armed forces says
[59:15.840 --> 59:22.760]  there is no role for the military in the 2020 presidential election. The article reveals
[59:22.760 --> 59:28.440]  that General Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, was responding to questions
[59:28.440 --> 59:34.560]  submitted by two members of Congress, Elisa Slotkin of Michigan and Mickey Sherrill of
[59:34.560 --> 59:41.400]  New Jersey, who were apparently recruiting the general support for a military coup.
[59:41.400 --> 59:46.240]  These two were amongst the first to call for the impeachment of the president last year
[59:46.240 --> 59:52.680]  for investigating Joe Biden's ties to the Ukraine in a Washington post op ed, seven
[59:52.680 --> 59:58.640]  freshman Democrats, all former military and intelligence operatives claimed to be a group
[59:58.640 --> 1:00:05.960]  of unified US patriots sworn to save America from Donald Trump. Abigail Spanberger and
[1:00:05.960 --> 1:00:13.360]  Elisa Slotkin were featured in headlines three years ago ex CIA officers running for Congress
[1:00:13.360 --> 1:00:20.160]  as Democrats. The article cited the unfounded Russia hoax as the inspiration for the so-called
[1:00:20.160 --> 1:00:27.720]  patriotic CIA operatives to run for office. NBC wrote that these CIA agents were fed up
[1:00:27.720 --> 1:00:34.240]  with the president and their new mission was to foil Trump. The move by the CIA to run
[1:00:34.240 --> 1:00:41.360]  agents in the 2018 elections came almost immediately after the president ordered devastating bombings
[1:00:41.360 --> 1:00:49.080]  of Afghanistan heroin operations, an operation that many believe was run by the CIA. This
[1:00:49.080 --> 1:00:54.520]  is not surprising. The CIA has been involved in the international opium market since their
[1:00:54.520 --> 1:01:01.680]  inception in 1947 when agency operatives worked with the Italian mafia and used heroin profits
[1:01:01.680 --> 1:01:08.560]  as CIA funding. Slotkin and Sherrill were not the first to request the US military's
[1:01:08.560 --> 1:01:15.840]  assistance in their coup d'etat against President Trump. On August 11th, a lifetime member of
[1:01:15.840 --> 1:01:21.000]  the Council on Foreign Relations, along with a former Lieutenant Colonel of the Army, wrote
[1:01:21.000 --> 1:01:26.840]  an open letter to General Milley. Like out of a Philip K. Dick novel, they predicted
[1:01:26.840 --> 1:01:32.040]  that Trump was mobilizing a secret army and threatened that General Milley would be guilty
[1:01:32.040 --> 1:01:37.640]  of treason if he would not help them remove the president from office. The publication
[1:01:37.640 --> 1:01:45.040]  of General Milley's response to these CIA operatives is a sign of the American deep state's weakness.
[1:01:45.040 --> 1:01:52.040]  They appear to be desperate for information.

[1:02:59.120 --> 1:03:01.120]  Waging war.
[1:03:01.120 --> 1:03:08.560]  In 1816, the gold standard, an economic unit of account based on a fixed quantity of gold
[1:03:08.560 --> 1:03:15.520]  was officially adopted and the World Reserve currency became the British pound sterling.
[1:03:15.520 --> 1:03:22.560]  In 1914, after World War One, nations attempted to revive the gold standard, but it collapsed
[1:03:22.560 --> 1:03:30.880]  during the Great Depression. Also in 1914, the Federal Reserve Bank, a private company,
[1:03:30.880 --> 1:03:37.600]  was born. After Britain was devastated by World War Two, they were no longer a superpower.
[1:03:37.600 --> 1:03:43.960]  And so the global reserve currency needed to be reset. In 1944, at the Bretton Woods
[1:03:43.960 --> 1:03:50.560]  Conference, the US dollar became the new global reserve currency. This established America
[1:03:50.560 --> 1:03:57.320]  as the dominant power in the world economy, giving America the sole ability to print dollars.
[1:03:57.320 --> 1:04:01.440]  The rest of the world would need to trade their own currency against the US dollar in
[1:04:01.440 --> 1:04:07.200]  order to balance exchange rates, keeping the international economy vibrant and fluid. But
[1:04:07.200 --> 1:04:14.520]  by the 1960s, the United States had printed more USD than their gold reserves could cover.
[1:04:14.520 --> 1:04:21.400]  And by 1970, a growing American trade deficit was undermining the value of the dollar.
[1:04:21.400 --> 1:04:28.720]  On August 15, 1971, President Richard Nixon brought an end to the gold standard. Federal
[1:04:28.720 --> 1:04:36.080]  Reserve notes of fiat currency backed by debt rather than gold became the new standard.
[1:04:36.080 --> 1:04:42.720]  This is basically no different than an IOU. As one would expect, right after President
[1:04:42.720 --> 1:04:48.880]  Nixon gave his speech, inflation began to rise and America's biggest export became
[1:04:48.880 --> 1:04:56.080]  debt. The creation of the petrodollar gave the US even more sway over world economies.
[1:04:56.080 --> 1:05:02.440]  And today, the international debt has become untenable. And many are saying another global
[1:05:02.440 --> 1:05:09.480]  currency reset is needed. Historically, the gold standard has been the most stable economy
[1:05:09.480 --> 1:05:15.680]  we have known. But gold can be manipulated and disruptive as well. Some are suggesting
[1:05:15.680 --> 1:05:22.120]  that cryptocurrency could be the solution. Crypto is run by an algorithm and can be designed
[1:05:22.120 --> 1:05:27.960]  to meet specific needs. The global currency needs to have fluid supply and the limited
[1:05:27.960 --> 1:05:35.560]  gold supply failed to keep up with economic growth. A sovereign free algorithm based alternative
[1:05:35.560 --> 1:05:42.840]  could potentially be more stable. China is almost ready to launch their own cryptocurrency,
[1:05:42.840 --> 1:05:50.520]  DCEP, short for digital currency electronic payments. DCEP is government controlled and
[1:05:50.520 --> 1:05:56.720]  fully centralized. So far, it appears to be a digital version of fiat paper money. The
[1:05:56.720 --> 1:06:03.240]  Federal Reserve Bank is developing their own crypto called Fedcoin. The coronavirus pandemic
[1:06:03.240 --> 1:06:08.840]  seems to be the perfect storm for a global currency reset. The amount of money printing
[1:06:08.840 --> 1:06:14.680]  involved in holding up failing economies as quarantines and shutdowns take place will
[1:06:14.680 --> 1:06:21.920]  be unprecedented. And all this does is weaken the US dollar even more. And when the US dollar
[1:06:21.920 --> 1:06:29.240]  falls, it will be replaced by something. The question is, which way will it go? This is
[1:06:29.240 --> 1:06:55.360]  Greg Ries for info wars.com. Godfather of the Rothschild Banking Cartel, Mayor Amshel
[1:06:55.360 --> 1:07:02.240]  Rothschild said, give me control of a nation's money and I care not who makes the laws. In
[1:07:02.240 --> 1:07:08.520]  a recent Bloomberg article, the feds cure risks being worse than the disease. Jim Bianco
[1:07:08.520 --> 1:07:14.600]  explains what is now happening with the Federal Reserve Bank in their response to the coronavirus.
[1:07:14.600 --> 1:07:20.640]  He writes, this scheme essentially merges the fed and treasury into one organization.
[1:07:20.640 --> 1:07:27.280]  So meet your new Fed Chairman, Donald J. Trump. Did President Trump just nationalize the Federal
[1:07:27.280 --> 1:07:37.840]  Reserve Bank? On June 4, 1963, President John F. Kennedy issued Executive Order 1111-0,
[1:07:37.840 --> 1:07:42.480]  which many believed was an effort to transfer power from the Federal Reserve Bank to the
[1:07:42.480 --> 1:07:47.480]  United States Department of the Treasury by replacing Federal Reserve notes with silver
[1:07:47.480 --> 1:07:54.160]  certificates, thereby taking the power away from the international banking cartels. Less
[1:07:54.160 --> 1:08:00.120]  than six months later, President Kennedy was assassinated, and his move against the Fed
[1:08:00.120 --> 1:08:07.160]  was reversed. During the Civil War, President Abraham Lincoln printed $400 million worth
[1:08:07.160 --> 1:08:14.880]  of greenbacks, a debt-free interest-free money independent of international bank control.
[1:08:14.880 --> 1:08:20.960]  In response, the London Times wrote that if that mischievous financial policy, which had
[1:08:20.960 --> 1:08:27.240]  its origin in the North American Republic, should become indurated down to a fixture,
[1:08:27.240 --> 1:08:33.000]  then that government will furnish its own money without cost. It will pay off debts and be
[1:08:33.000 --> 1:08:39.440]  without debt. It will have all the money necessary to carry on its commerce. It will become prosperous
[1:08:39.440 --> 1:08:44.360]  beyond precedent in the history of the civilized governments of the world. The brains and the
[1:08:44.360 --> 1:08:51.280]  wealth of all countries will go to North America. That government must be destroyed, or it will
[1:08:51.280 --> 1:08:58.200]  destroy every monarchy on the globe. The bankers were not willing to lose power, and the Bank
[1:08:58.200 --> 1:09:03.880]  of England went on to fund the Confederacy. Weeks prior to Lincoln's assassination...
[1:09:03.880 --> 1:09:10.400]  I'm glad we're airing this piece, and we're just living in such incredibly historic times,
[1:09:10.400 --> 1:09:14.080]  and they're putting all this negative stimulus out there to try to make us kill each other,
[1:09:14.080 --> 1:09:17.760]  to try to make us negative, and to try to make us fight with each other. We just can't
[1:09:17.760 --> 1:09:23.280]  let people do that, including myself, because I'm always an honest person about things,
[1:09:23.280 --> 1:09:28.440]  and if I could tell you the stuff that's going on behind the scenes, and then the mental
[1:09:28.440 --> 1:09:34.360]  things I've done to not care, the problem is once you go past that point, it's not
[1:09:34.360 --> 1:09:38.560]  just that you don't care. They're trying to destroy you and trying to kill you. You
[1:09:38.560 --> 1:09:44.560]  get to where you like it, and then there's a problem, when you sit here and you look
[1:09:44.560 --> 1:09:51.880]  at what they're doing constantly, that you flip out on things that don't matter. I guess
[1:09:51.880 --> 1:09:58.800]  they call that PTSD or whatever. You can't like the joke with Walter Sulpcheck in The
[1:09:58.800 --> 1:10:03.480]  Big Lebowski. Big stuff doesn't get you upset, but little stuff gets you upset. I know we're
[1:10:03.480 --> 1:10:07.960]  all going through this. Record amounts of family violence, record amounts of murders, record
[1:10:07.960 --> 1:10:13.440]  amounts of suicide, and I just want all the listeners to just give it to God, take a deep
[1:10:13.440 --> 1:10:20.080]  breath, and just be positive, because it's completely normal when you're going through
[1:10:20.080 --> 1:10:25.880]  cult programming like this, and being lied to like this to be pissed, and we just have
[1:10:25.880 --> 1:10:30.800]  to give it to God and not feel like we're doing a bad job, because I'm constantly feeling
[1:10:30.800 --> 1:10:35.200]  like I'm not doing enough of a good job, because I always talk about myself, you know why I'm
[1:10:35.200 --> 1:10:39.960]  like this. My brain sees this, knows this, knows their next move, knows the next move,
[1:10:39.960 --> 1:10:46.760]  the next move, and then when you try to articulate something like that, with all the stimuli
[1:10:46.760 --> 1:10:54.880]  going on, it's very hard, but let me just say this. God is in control. Amazingly positive
[1:10:54.880 --> 1:10:59.880]  things are happening, and Info Wars was made for this, and born for this, and the listeners,
[1:10:59.880 --> 1:11:03.360]  and the affiliates, and the sponsors, and the crew, and everybody are just as important
[1:11:03.360 --> 1:11:11.760]  as my loud mouth is up here covering all this, but it is all happening now, and there is
[1:11:11.760 --> 1:11:18.880]  an attempted forced evolution taking place against humanity that's extremely evil. Now
[1:11:18.880 --> 1:11:25.440]  I was going to air those two pieces, and I just aired part of one, and the rest of another,
[1:11:25.440 --> 1:11:29.000]  at the start of the fourth hour that I'm taking over today, so we're going to air something
[1:11:29.000 --> 1:11:34.120]  very, very special that I was sent by one of the crew this morning, and then I took
[1:11:34.120 --> 1:11:40.680]  some time out to watch, and we're going to be premiering here on this show in the fourth
[1:11:40.680 --> 1:11:50.640]  hour today, but it deals as an intro with what Greg Rees talked about back in March 15th
[1:11:50.640 --> 1:11:56.760]  and March 29th of this year, the perfect storm for global currency reset, war with international
[1:11:56.760 --> 1:12:04.840]  banking cartel, or Nacera, and that is actually the two competing programs, so we're going
[1:12:04.840 --> 1:12:09.240]  to explain this, and really define who's who, and what's happening coming up in the fourth
[1:12:09.240 --> 1:12:16.720]  hour today. I'm going to now stop preaching, and I'm going to get focused, and when we
[1:12:16.720 --> 1:12:25.160]  come back, we're going to hit just incredible news on the deep state war that's going on,
[1:12:25.160 --> 1:12:29.200]  and the civil war they're trying to launch, and the fact that it's backfiring on them
[1:12:29.200 --> 1:12:34.960]  spectacularly, and what Trump is up to, and so much more, but let's all just take a deep
[1:12:34.960 --> 1:12:40.360]  breath and just not let the globalist push us into a fight, because that's what they're
[1:12:40.360 --> 1:12:44.600]  trying to do is punch the buttons to get us into a fight mode, and to get us to stabilize
[1:12:44.600 --> 1:13:14.520]  me to be in that very calm, focused, frosty place.
[1:13:14.520 --> 1:13:35.600]  It's going to be interesting.
[1:13:35.600 --> 1:13:41.440]  More support of Info Wars has stood in defiance of George Soros, The Globalist, Hillary and
[1:13:41.440 --> 1:13:43.920]  all these comebacks, so great job.
[1:13:43.920 --> 1:13:48.040]  You built what we've done, I salute you.
[1:13:48.040 --> 1:13:52.280]  This isn't about me taking credit, in fact it's the opposite, it's about getting you
[1:13:52.280 --> 1:13:54.960]  to understand that you have all the power.
[1:13:54.960 --> 1:13:59.760]  Going back three weeks ago, they had the entire Austin Greenbelt shut down and they had the
[1:13:59.760 --> 1:14:06.200]  spillway by Barton Springs shut down as well as the main pool that's always been paid for
[1:14:06.200 --> 1:14:09.760]  the last 50 years or so, it's a damned up spring.
[1:14:09.760 --> 1:14:15.560]  Well we went down there and we got in the park at different areas around town in the
[1:14:15.560 --> 1:14:20.480]  last few weeks and educated people that it was all a giant fraud and now despite the
[1:14:20.480 --> 1:14:24.680]  fact that they still say the parks are closed, you get out of any area and you'll see dozens
[1:14:24.680 --> 1:14:28.840]  if not hundreds of people depending where you're at actually using Barton Springs
[1:14:28.840 --> 1:14:30.480]  here in Austin, Texas.
[1:14:30.480 --> 1:14:35.560]  So Bill Gates and The Globalist give the orders to the UN, the UN gives the orders down through
[1:14:35.560 --> 1:14:40.560]  the National Health Services like our NIH and we all follow it like dutiful slaves.
[1:14:40.560 --> 1:14:43.460]  Stop complying with your own enslavement.
[1:14:43.460 --> 1:14:46.680]  Stop following the orders of these globalist traders.
[1:14:46.680 --> 1:15:14.680]  They're being free again.
[1:15:14.680 --> 1:15:19.600]  As of 30 minutes ago, it may have updated now, if you type into Google or Bing or any
[1:15:19.600 --> 1:15:29.040]  of the mainline search engines, Portland shooting, you get police don't know if it was political.
[1:15:29.040 --> 1:15:32.960]  Actually police have a suspect, they have a person seen following the vehicles, they
[1:15:32.960 --> 1:15:37.720]  have the same looking person at the scene, they have witnesses, they have it all but
[1:15:37.720 --> 1:15:41.360]  they're just saying oh, they don't know if it's political, even the New York Times came
[1:15:41.360 --> 1:15:48.320]  out on Saturday and said that it was anti for shot by a right wing Nazi and see all
[1:15:48.320 --> 1:15:50.160]  they do is call you a Nazi and then they kill you.
[1:15:50.160 --> 1:16:00.800]  We have the founder of the Patriot Paragroup Joey Gibson joining us with J. Bishop's friend
[1:16:00.800 --> 1:16:06.360]  Chandler Papas who was there right next to him in the video when the man shoots him twice
[1:16:06.360 --> 1:16:08.280]  in the chest and then runs away.
[1:16:08.280 --> 1:16:12.320]  They say oh, we got a trumpet, there he is, pull it out, there he is, pull it out, bam,
[1:16:12.320 --> 1:16:18.440]  bam, twice in the chest, died minutes later lying there on the concrete.
[1:16:18.440 --> 1:16:28.240]  The reason this is so important is in Kenosha they were chasing somebody down saying we're
[1:16:28.240 --> 1:16:33.400]  going to kill you, they had guns, not just one guy but it looks like two had guns, they
[1:16:33.400 --> 1:16:40.880]  had huge criminal records, convicted pedophiles, convicted burglars, convicted woman beaters
[1:16:40.880 --> 1:16:44.280]  and huge rap sheets and they're chasing them down, we're going to kill you and they say
[1:16:44.280 --> 1:16:49.120]  on Facebook, my only regret is I didn't kill him.
[1:16:49.120 --> 1:16:55.560]  That's what the lawyers for Rittenhouse are coming out and they're saying look, he's going
[1:16:55.560 --> 1:17:00.800]  to have these charges dropped, he didn't do any of this as the evidence mounts that he
[1:17:00.800 --> 1:17:05.200]  was a community volunteer helping us a lifeguard, helping get rid of graffiti, he was out there
[1:17:05.200 --> 1:17:09.080]  providing security for homes and businesses that were being torched.
[1:17:09.080 --> 1:17:18.640]  But with all this going on we have total gaslighting happening, blaming left-wing violence, rioting
[1:17:18.640 --> 1:17:26.360]  on Trump is bizarrely ludicrous, Biden emerges from basement, sees violence and makes the
[1:17:26.360 --> 1:17:32.120]  unbelievable statement that the deadly violence we saw overnight in Portland is unacceptable,
[1:17:32.120 --> 1:17:35.280]  shooting in the streets of a great nation, city is unacceptable, I condemn the violence
[1:17:35.280 --> 1:17:39.880]  unequivocally, I condemn violence of every kind but anyone, whether or not they're left
[1:17:39.880 --> 1:17:45.480]  or right, Biden said even though Kamala Harris' partner has praised Antifa and all the rest
[1:17:45.480 --> 1:17:46.480]  of it.
[1:17:46.480 --> 1:17:51.880]  But let's hear from the friend of murdered Trump supporter speaking out before he joins
[1:17:51.880 --> 1:17:56.880]  us next hour, J. Bishop's friend, Chandler Papas, here it is.
[1:17:56.880 --> 1:18:08.560]  It escalated to the point that they executed my partner, they hunted him down, they hunted
[1:18:08.560 --> 1:18:13.880]  us down, they recognized our Patriot Prayer hats, anybody who doesn't know Patriot Prayer
[1:18:13.880 --> 1:18:22.320]  really gives them, the citizens have accused me man, we support him, Christian we can start
[1:18:22.320 --> 1:18:23.320]  with.
[1:18:23.320 --> 1:18:25.400]  So they identified our hats, we've got a couple of them right here, we've got a couple of
[1:18:25.400 --> 1:18:32.760]  them right here, pull it out, pull it out, and so they turned around, they didn't even
[1:18:32.760 --> 1:18:36.280]  register that somebody was pointing a gun at us until the shots went off and it took
[1:18:36.280 --> 1:18:37.280]  off running.
[1:18:37.280 --> 1:18:45.960]  The shooter took off running and you know, it takes a second for you to process everything
[1:18:45.960 --> 1:18:56.760]  that happened, you know, he just shoot at me, okay, I'm okay, turn over, and Jay's dead.
[1:18:56.760 --> 1:19:04.000]  Because he believes something different, Jay's not a racist, he's not a xenophobe or whatever
[1:19:04.000 --> 1:19:17.000]  label, he's not an ist or an ism, he's an independent man, he's a good man, and he didn't do anything
[1:19:17.000 --> 1:19:21.600]  to earn a bullet in the chest, if you could ask anything right now, Donald Trump, what
[1:19:21.600 --> 1:19:35.320]  would it be, centrus, centrus, arrest these, Orleans is as corrupt as any place you've
[1:19:35.320 --> 1:19:38.840]  ever seen, any place you've ever heard about in the movies, I have a friend sitting right
[1:19:38.840 --> 1:19:45.160]  behind me here, who's being charged currently with a felony riot while the DA is letting
[1:19:45.160 --> 1:19:48.560]  all these actual rioters out on the street, he was just out there waving an American
[1:19:48.560 --> 1:19:56.040]  flag, it's been charges pending for what, two years, but somebody was throwing explosive
[1:19:56.040 --> 1:20:01.480]  devices at the police, somebody when I went to the hospital and I met a Homeland Security
[1:20:01.480 --> 1:20:05.640]  officer who was there because his buddy had caught him all around in the chest and burned
[1:20:05.640 --> 1:20:12.360]  right through his uniform, he got third degree burns all over his torso, those people are
[1:20:12.360 --> 1:20:19.520]  being let go, while Christians and conservatives and anybody who is being locked up, full video
[1:20:19.520 --> 1:20:28.920]  at newswars.com and infowars.com, they hunted him down, says friend of slain jay bishop,
[1:20:28.920 --> 1:20:31.720]  and that's what they do, they charge you with rioting for having an American flag and they
[1:20:31.720 --> 1:20:35.600]  say we're stirring up trouble, when people that live there go out and say we deserve
[1:20:35.600 --> 1:20:43.680]  free speech, absolutely disgusting, these are communists, but you notice he said well
[1:20:43.680 --> 1:20:47.360]  he wasn't a racist, he deserved his die, so what if he was a racist, black racist, white
[1:20:47.360 --> 1:20:51.680]  racist, they don't deserve his die, these are white political operatives paid for by
[1:20:51.680 --> 1:20:56.560]  Soros and Alexander Soros on record trying to stir up a war in America and a cover to
[1:20:56.560 --> 1:21:01.400]  overthrow the president and destroy the dollar and end America so globalists can come in
[1:21:01.400 --> 1:21:06.840]  and buy up America for pennies on the dollar, that's the admitted plan and mainstream media
[1:21:06.840 --> 1:21:10.800]  and a lot of other people all over YouTube, all over Facebook are saying the dollar's
[1:21:10.800 --> 1:21:17.560]  dead, America's over, when our currency's way less devalued than the Chinese or the
[1:21:17.560 --> 1:21:23.640]  EU currency, why would people say that, of course it's fiat, of course it's overblown,
[1:21:23.640 --> 1:21:29.000]  nothing compared to them, this guy's 60 years old and overweight, his heart's bad, what
[1:21:29.000 --> 1:21:33.360]  about some 90-year-old dude, his heart's a lot worse, that's China's, they're doing
[1:21:33.360 --> 1:21:39.880]  it to bring us down, to conquer us and they've got all these followers and all this scum
[1:21:39.880 --> 1:21:44.080]  that believe mainstream media, the same type of folks that are obsessed with get rich quick
[1:21:44.080 --> 1:21:47.520]  schemes or lottery tickets and I'll put you down if you like lottery tickets, but people
[1:21:47.520 --> 1:21:51.960]  that really believe they're going to win are Nigerian scams and they're just buying
[1:21:51.960 --> 1:21:55.480]  in, the left's going to give them the power, the left's going to empower, they just go
[1:21:55.480 --> 1:22:01.600]  out and beat some people, shoot some people, run some folks down and now like gangland
[1:22:01.600 --> 1:22:05.440]  they were attacking and burning down houses and businesses and somebody fired back at
[1:22:05.440 --> 1:22:08.400]  them when they were attacking them and oh, now we've got to go out and randomly like
[1:22:08.400 --> 1:22:16.000]  a gang, crips and bloods, kill somebody on their side, it's a guy with an American flag
[1:22:16.000 --> 1:22:19.520]  and now the media's trying to cover that up and say oh, we don't know it was political,
[1:22:19.520 --> 1:22:26.920]  we don't know what happened, that's who these people fundamentally are, but you hear Chandler
[1:22:26.920 --> 1:22:30.760]  Papas, a nice guy but almost would like to Stockholm sender, I'm like he didn't do anything
[1:22:30.760 --> 1:22:34.320]  wrong, he wasn't a racist, he wasn't a beggar, he didn't deserve to die, no he didn't deserve
[1:22:34.320 --> 1:22:42.120]  to die, scum has been trained to kill innocent people and to attack men, women and children
[1:22:42.120 --> 1:22:47.760]  and you know those mortar rounds, people every year with those fireworks, the ones you hand
[1:22:47.760 --> 1:22:50.920]  light and drop it in the deal and I'm not for banning them, you better be careful, they
[1:22:50.920 --> 1:22:53.760]  might as well buy the bigger boxes that you light it and they all shoot and you can get
[1:22:53.760 --> 1:22:56.960]  away from them, people blow their arms off, their hands off all the time with those, you
[1:22:56.960 --> 1:23:01.880]  can kill somebody with one of those, those are explosives, that's what they shoot at
[1:23:01.880 --> 1:23:08.960]  the police but when they kill a cop or wound one, you never hear their name, you always
[1:23:08.960 --> 1:23:14.920]  hear the name of the people running around starting the fights if something happens to
[1:23:14.920 --> 1:23:21.160]  you and if you look at the type of just trash, glow of the dark type folks, what my dad calls
[1:23:21.160 --> 1:23:28.400]  them, these are just empty virtue signaling garbage and that's what you expect, that's
[1:23:28.400 --> 1:23:33.520]  what comes out of the rear end of Soros, that's what Soros and his demon son Alexander crap
[1:23:33.520 --> 1:23:39.160]  on us all day long, now when we come back, we've got more on this and where it's going
[1:23:39.160 --> 1:23:51.160]  next than Elon Musk's brain chip, stay with us, there's a nauseating sense to it, not
[1:23:51.160 --> 1:24:00.520]  a sense of triumph, not a sense of victory, not a sense of completion, a sense of sixth
[1:24:00.520 --> 1:24:06.440]  nausea, though we were right about the world government, we were right about the anti-human
[1:24:06.440 --> 1:24:12.840]  plans, we were right about all the horrible things, the globalists and their satanic order
[1:24:12.840 --> 1:24:19.680]  wanted to do to us and now we sit here, warning people for decades, trying to get people ready,
[1:24:19.680 --> 1:24:25.040]  trying to stop what was coming but you know what, revelations and God's word says it's
[1:24:25.040 --> 1:24:29.320]  coming so you can't stop it and it's in that understanding that we're part of God's larger
[1:24:29.320 --> 1:24:35.960]  plan that he come to the point in our own psyche, our own spirit, our own will that
[1:24:35.960 --> 1:24:42.840]  we submit to God and realize God's in charge, God has power and the devil is set as a tester
[1:24:42.840 --> 1:24:47.040]  and now it's up to us to make the right decision, that's what it's really always been about.
[1:24:47.040 --> 1:24:51.520]  Constantly whether it's the New York Times, the Washington Post or Howard Stern of a blue
[1:24:51.520 --> 1:24:56.560]  name and they come out and they attack him full war saying, Jones claims civil wars coming
[1:24:56.560 --> 1:25:02.080]  and financial collapse and planetary lockdowns using viruses and he tells people they should
[1:25:02.080 --> 1:25:07.480]  get off the grid and get prepared and have storable food if they can and now everything
[1:25:07.480 --> 1:25:12.640]  I've warned people about is coming true because it was all in the Rockefeller Foundation documents
[1:25:12.640 --> 1:25:18.880]  like lockstep, this is the corporate planetary takeover so yes I stand by what I said ten

[1:25:46.120 --> 1:25:52.040]  This is a maximum alert, a maximum alert, as of taking this alert you're 82 days out
[1:25:52.040 --> 1:25:56.760]  from the election, as many of you know in the last year I pointed out statements out
[1:25:56.760 --> 1:26:00.800]  of the council on foreign relations and other globalist organs that they know Trump is going
[1:26:00.800 --> 1:26:07.160]  to win in a landslide, so their strategy will be to contest the election if they fail to
[1:26:07.160 --> 1:26:12.520]  successfully steal it, then they are openly now war gaining, this is in the New York Times,
[1:26:12.520 --> 1:26:17.320]  having democrat states and cities secede from the union just like they've ignored Trump's
[1:26:17.320 --> 1:26:23.320]  policies on coronavirus and kept their areas locked down, that is nothing but a dress rehearsal,
[1:26:23.320 --> 1:26:27.080]  they are saying they're going to have their own separate inauguration not in DC, they
[1:26:27.080 --> 1:26:33.960]  said in another city, Colossia said this, when they crown Biden and Kamala Harris, ladies
[1:26:33.960 --> 1:26:39.800]  and gentlemen this is the organized civil war, this is their public criminal plan, we
[1:26:39.800 --> 1:26:43.320]  should be praying, we should be spreading the word, we should be demanding Trump won the
[1:26:43.320 --> 1:27:09.320]  office to expose this criminal activity, you're listening to the Alex Jones show,
[1:27:09.320 --> 1:27:24.280]  listen up, she's a razor sharp, she'll get her way, she'll slice you apart, she's a cool,
[1:27:24.280 --> 1:27:36.120]  cool black, like a cat, and if you get your name, well you might not make it back,
[1:27:36.120 --> 1:27:47.720]  you might not make it back, she's got the looks that kill, she's got the looks that kill,
[1:27:52.840 --> 1:28:01.480]  beer kills, all right let's get serious here, let's talk about it right now,
[1:28:01.480 --> 1:28:07.960]  I've got a lot of news to cover on the globalist coup, the economy, how they're trying to crash
[1:28:07.960 --> 1:28:13.240]  it, what's going to happen the next three days, in my view how we counter it, but last night
[1:28:13.240 --> 1:28:20.120]  I'm sitting there with Jason Jones, and I saw Jason Jones, you know, four or five months ago
[1:28:20.120 --> 1:28:23.720]  when they had fake COVID testing centers, he went and discovered they were fake,
[1:28:23.720 --> 1:28:27.080]  and that the hospitals were empty and it was all made up, and back then it was like is he
[1:28:27.080 --> 1:28:33.240]  accurate, later turn out it was all true, but then when I looked at his bio, I'm like this guy's
[1:28:33.240 --> 1:28:38.120]  won international top awards, I mean he's got big movies with top movie stars in them, this is a big
[1:28:38.120 --> 1:28:42.920]  guy, especially in Hawaii and California, I mean I even knew who he was, he got arrested two out
[1:28:42.920 --> 1:28:47.800]  protest and trying to open stuff up a few months ago, he left Hawaii to come to Texas, he's an army
[1:28:47.800 --> 1:28:56.680]  veteran and patriot, and he's in here yesterday talking calmly about being in the army, and how
[1:28:56.680 --> 1:29:01.320]  in their unit a bunch of people got sick and had to be medically discharged, and one person died,
[1:29:01.320 --> 1:29:08.440]  and everyone I know that's been in the military a long time, active duty, knows members of their
[1:29:08.440 --> 1:29:15.640]  units that died after vaccines, now now think about that, I was down at Fort San Houston one time,
[1:29:16.200 --> 1:29:19.480]  and these army guys were giving me a tour, and they said yeah here's where they gave
[1:29:20.040 --> 1:29:26.040]  20 guys shots, and three of them died in a test, they don't just give poor black folks stuff and
[1:29:26.040 --> 1:29:32.040]  kill them with tests, and it's not the whole military, it's all compartmentalization to see
[1:29:32.040 --> 1:29:36.760]  who follow orders, and then here's Jason Jones, I'm talking about vaccines killing people,
[1:29:39.480 --> 1:29:44.120]  and he just goes oh yeah one of the guys in my unit died when they gave us a shot in Japan,
[1:29:47.640 --> 1:29:52.040]  and I just remember all the military people I've talked to, officers, non-enlisted, you know,
[1:29:52.040 --> 1:30:04.360]  enlisted, non-enlisted, commissioned, non-commission, about people they know that died taking vaccines,
[1:30:04.360 --> 1:30:08.200]  and it's on record, they have libel protection, and now Gates is like oh this new vaccine,
[1:30:09.080 --> 1:30:14.760]  20% go to the hospital, some die, and then I'm reading about people in the trials dying,
[1:30:14.760 --> 1:30:20.440]  and then Google will bring the articles down, even though it's local news, this person valiantly,
[1:30:20.440 --> 1:30:25.880]  25 year old woman, healthy, took the COVID vaccine and died, services are this Wednesday,
[1:30:25.880 --> 1:30:33.160]  and then it's taken off Google, just like they're taking off that the feds are busting huge child
[1:30:33.160 --> 1:30:40.040]  kidnapping rings everywhere, and they will de-list that off Google, so I mean the people running
[1:30:40.040 --> 1:30:47.320]  big tech man are protecting pedophiles, covering up vaccine damage, and they're just criminal scum,
[1:30:47.320 --> 1:30:52.680]  and I'm not just signaling out Google that these are bad people, we should have known when Google
[1:30:52.680 --> 1:30:58.120]  said their motto was don't be evil, imagine if my logo was like I'm not evil, you'd be like
[1:30:58.120 --> 1:31:05.160]  why are you telling me that, you know what I am evil, I'm very evil, I'm a very evil person,
[1:31:05.160 --> 1:31:09.960]  very fallen person, I have great knowledge of evil, it's disgusting, but I don't follow it,
[1:31:09.960 --> 1:31:17.080]  I follow God, so I'm 40% satanic, 60% Christian, but I'm carrying out the Christian operations,
[1:31:17.080 --> 1:31:24.520]  but I don't sit or tell you, oh I'm not evil, I'm really good, I'd be a liar,
[1:31:26.680 --> 1:31:31.480]  I don't carry out evil, but I mean I've got full knowledge of it, and then some, like anybody
[1:31:31.480 --> 1:31:37.080]  else does, and so I was just thinking about this, this morning about, and last night it was very
[1:31:37.080 --> 1:31:40.600]  haunting, I think I had a nightmare about it last night, and it was like Jason Jones,
[1:31:40.600 --> 1:31:44.920]  they're talking on the air, I had a nightmare like 3am, because the nightmare like went on
[1:31:44.920 --> 1:31:49.880]  and on, and then the member of my unit died, and it was just like how we just, and how many
[1:31:49.880 --> 1:31:54.280]  military people I was remembering over the years, my uncle and all these people that said yeah,
[1:31:54.280 --> 1:31:59.240]  they'd line us up, give us shots, we'd be super sick, they were testing on them, we know that,
[1:31:59.240 --> 1:32:02.360]  experimental stuff, and then there's two people working in this office, they get mad when I talk
[1:32:02.360 --> 1:32:10.280]  about it, who had their children die from vaccines, and they didn't even die, and the amount of abuse
[1:32:10.280 --> 1:32:18.360]  we've put up with this pisses me off, and then Roger Stone came on, the new Owen Schreuer show,
[1:32:18.360 --> 1:32:22.120]  Sunday Live, that comes on right after me at 6pm, best Roger Stone interview ever,
[1:32:22.120 --> 1:32:25.240]  he didn't get into Russiagate and all that, he got into handicapped in the election, the polls,
[1:32:25.240 --> 1:32:28.440]  all of it, that was really good, that's a Band-Aid video, but I'm digressing,
[1:32:30.520 --> 1:32:33.960]  yeah there it is, Roger Stone's back in the game, he has powerful election analysis,
[1:32:34.520 --> 1:32:38.120]  how you guys even do about it, this crew is so good, they're almost like psychic,
[1:32:38.120 --> 1:32:43.480]  and just pull it up before I even think of it, so that's coming up, and then we've got the guys
[1:32:43.480 --> 1:32:46.680]  coming on, I hate to even talk about it, but the guys are heroes, just out there exercising
[1:32:46.680 --> 1:32:52.360]  his first amendment, in the face of terrorists, and got killed, J Bishop, got admiring,
[1:32:54.520 --> 1:33:00.120]  got admiring, you know, I'm sad when I see his face, but I'm kind of proud, you know, I'm not
[1:33:00.120 --> 1:33:07.400]  glad he's dead, but we got the good people folks, they got the bad people, and he was out there
[1:33:07.400 --> 1:33:14.120]  doing exactly what he wanted to do, he was out there standing up to evil, lovingly telling the
[1:33:14.120 --> 1:33:20.920]  truth for our freedom, in the face of that scum, and he was murdered by a demon, and he's in God's
[1:33:20.920 --> 1:33:28.600]  hands now, here's Jason Jones laying it out, I was flying from New York to DC, and the guys
[1:33:28.600 --> 1:33:31.560]  sitting next to me, we started talking like, what do you do, he goes, I develop vaccines, and so
[1:33:31.560 --> 1:33:36.760]  you're not gonna like me, I'm an anti-vaxxer, he's the one I developed the swine flu vaccine,
[1:33:36.760 --> 1:33:41.480]  and I am now an anti-vaxxer too, I'm going to testify before Congress, beautiful, because the
[1:33:41.480 --> 1:33:46.680]  vaccine I created helped create his killing people, he showed me some videos, which you can see on
[1:33:46.680 --> 1:33:52.120]  Google, and YouTube, I think they're still there, if you look up swine flu vaccine side effects,
[1:33:52.120 --> 1:33:56.920]  there's one of, where one of the side effects is you can only talk while jogging or walking
[1:33:56.920 --> 1:34:01.000]  backwards, it sounds like I'm making this up, you hear it, you laugh, it's true, Google, YouTube it,
[1:34:01.000 --> 1:34:06.600]  and when I was in the military, we had to get the Japanese encephalitis vaccine,
[1:34:06.600 --> 1:34:11.400]  which was experimental, in my unit, somebody died, several people were chaptered out because the
[1:34:11.400 --> 1:34:14.360]  side effects were so severe, and the rest of our unit got a letter saying,
[1:34:14.360 --> 1:34:19.640]  don't ever donate blood or bone marrow, and they're like, oh, there's no side effects,
[1:34:19.640 --> 1:34:23.880]  everything's fine, so we have a crew member who had to wear a mask for three months after they
[1:34:23.880 --> 1:34:28.840]  got a shot to go to Vietnam, and literally they said, don't ever take a shot again, they'll kill
[1:34:28.840 --> 1:34:33.640]  you, this causes an auto immune response, so they have something they have not, I mean they know
[1:34:33.640 --> 1:34:37.240]  this is going on, and then we're like, hey, watch this, oh, you're crazy, nothing's going on.
[1:34:37.800 --> 1:34:42.040]  They're telling us it's safe, and they haven't even made, they haven't tested, it doesn't exist,
[1:34:42.040 --> 1:34:46.680]  how can you say it's safe? I saw a sign. Exactly, they're already talking about making a mandatory,
[1:34:46.680 --> 1:34:51.960]  and it's already putting 20% of people to take in the hospital, in test. The woman they made a
[1:34:51.960 --> 1:34:56.280]  hear out of in the UK, they said, you know, she was this great, she was, you know what,
[1:34:56.280 --> 1:35:00.920]  she was a beautiful, noble person who wanted to be of service to her community, trusted everybody,
[1:35:00.920 --> 1:35:07.160]  and was the first person to get in the UK to get the vaccine trials, what happened to her?
[1:35:07.800 --> 1:35:12.600]  She died, so. I forgot about that, and it was an article, the guy they had on CNN,
[1:35:12.600 --> 1:35:16.200]  who was the healthy model guy, I forget his name, he almost died, I got paralyzed.
[1:35:17.160 --> 1:35:21.400]  And these are good people who believe everything they're being told. They're stepping up. They
[1:35:21.400 --> 1:35:25.800]  trust Bill Gates. How can you not trust Bill Gates? But that's what worries me, we're about to go to
[1:35:25.800 --> 1:35:31.880]  break final segment, 4-0 intakes over. Why are they admitting it's killing people? They didn't
[1:35:31.880 --> 1:35:35.960]  used to admit that. I think they know they can't cover it up now. So they're just like, okay,
[1:35:35.960 --> 1:35:45.160]  might hurt you really bad, but no big deal. Well, in these debates, specifically the televised
[1:35:45.160 --> 1:35:51.640]  debates, ever since they began, have become so instrumental in people deciding who they vote
[1:35:51.640 --> 1:35:55.880]  for. Everybody knows that, that's why they become such a big thing. And you know, with the makeup
[1:35:55.880 --> 1:36:00.760]  and the lights, when you talk about the history, but has there ever been a candidate, Roger? I mean,
[1:36:00.760 --> 1:36:05.880]  you've been studying politics for more than I've been alive, not to age, it's just your wisdom.
[1:36:05.880 --> 1:36:10.040]  Has there ever been a candidate that hasn't interviewed for the job of president? Has there
[1:36:10.040 --> 1:36:12.360]  ever been a candidate that literally doesn't do- By the way, I'm going to play this Roger
[1:36:12.360 --> 1:36:17.160]  Strong clip when we come back. And watching me last night, the amount I interrupt is very obnoxious,
[1:36:17.160 --> 1:36:20.440]  and I apologize. I'm not interrupting because I'm going to be the center of attention.
[1:36:20.440 --> 1:36:25.000]  Everything he sings is true. So I get excited when I'm with the murdering people. So I just
[1:36:25.000 --> 1:36:29.400]  start hopping up and down like a wild man. But everybody knows I've gotten better about not
[1:36:29.400 --> 1:36:34.280]  interrupting. I've gotten 80% better. My God, I'm still, still bad about it. I'm going to shut up.
[1:36:35.000 --> 1:36:39.560]  But just hearing about all that makes me sick. We've got to expose this. These aren't vaccines,
[1:36:39.560 --> 1:36:49.000]  folks. They're soft kill weapons from the deep state. It was a sleeper product. It wasn't popular
[1:36:49.000 --> 1:36:53.640]  at first, but as people tried it, it's become one of our top five best sellers. I'm talking about
[1:36:53.640 --> 1:36:59.800]  the eight pack power stack. 13 different pills filled with super nutrients, vitamins, minerals,
[1:36:59.800 --> 1:37:05.720]  and more that you take in the morning and one pack and at night. It's available right now at 60%
[1:37:05.720 --> 1:37:11.080]  off for a limited time when you get it with survival shield X2 that's now back in stock.
[1:37:11.080 --> 1:37:15.640]  This has changed my life and so many other people's lives. Now here's the problem. Some of the
[1:37:15.640 --> 1:37:20.360]  patented ingredients that are in a pack power stack because of the shutdown and the lockdown
[1:37:20.360 --> 1:37:25.720]  are not available for us to even reorder it. So this could be the last shipment that we ever
[1:37:25.720 --> 1:37:31.480]  have. It's in stock now. Take advantage of this new combo special part of a larger cell we have

[1:37:43.800 --> 1:37:51.800]  ever. Going back more than 20 years ago, I coined the term the false left right paradigm from reading
[1:37:51.800 --> 1:37:58.200]  the books by Carol Quigley speaking to Brzezinski and others how they described powerful institutions
[1:37:58.200 --> 1:38:05.880]  and foundations successful takeover of the left parties and right parties in Europe and the United
[1:38:05.880 --> 1:38:10.120]  States. It didn't mean that those parties didn't have differences before. They were able to get
[1:38:10.120 --> 1:38:14.760]  control the leadership of both and manipulate the public with the illusion of change and the
[1:38:14.760 --> 1:38:20.600]  illusion of a fight going on like WWF wrestling or something with Trump and with our populist
[1:38:20.600 --> 1:38:26.040]  movement taking over the republicans. This is a real populist movement doesn't mean it's perfect
[1:38:26.040 --> 1:38:30.440]  and you know it's real because the democrats the power structure the chai comms and the entire
[1:38:30.440 --> 1:38:35.640]  old republican leadership have all endorsed Joe Biden. That's why I'm supporting Trump. It's about
[1:38:35.640 --> 1:38:41.000]  americanism not globalism. It's about ending the one-sided trade deals by defending our borders
[1:38:41.000 --> 1:38:44.760]  by defending the right to second amendment and pro-life and Trump's doing all of that.
[1:38:46.280 --> 1:38:51.560]  I'm not going to lie to you. I want to stay in the fight against Soros and Hillary and the new
[1:38:51.560 --> 1:38:56.360]  world order and the only way I do is if you buy a lot of products then for store.com.

[1:41:39.480 --> 1:41:44.680]  media is still covering up what happened there but i was watching the show last night after i went

[1:42:27.640 --> 1:42:31.960]  to get plenty of me don't you but it's important to be on at night non saturday afternoon and
[1:42:31.960 --> 1:42:37.320]  sunday night because so much is breaking it's key we get on up front and we're doing it so here's a
[1:42:37.320 --> 1:42:42.280]  couple clips from last night the new sunday live i was doing that he'll keep doing after the elections
[1:42:42.280 --> 1:42:47.800]  over he wants to do that a lot of stations want to pick it up uh with roger stone on polls uh and
[1:42:47.800 --> 1:42:55.160]  then uh also uh on the uh election in general but here is here is roger stone last night on polls
[1:42:56.920 --> 1:43:02.920]  roger let's get political here i'm seeing an incredible shift in polling right now and i don't
[1:43:02.920 --> 1:43:06.120]  know how much you take into account polling i know you have to measure it in your own way
[1:43:06.760 --> 1:43:12.440]  we know these polls are obviously skewed democrat if that's how you want to phrase it but even with
[1:43:12.440 --> 1:43:18.840]  the skewed polling that said hillary clinton 99 chance in 2016 those skewed those same skewed
[1:43:18.840 --> 1:43:24.120]  polls are now saying trump is gaining and even ahead of biden in battleground states i'm seeing
[1:43:24.120 --> 1:43:29.720]  numbers up to 30 percent of black americans are going to be voting for donald trump uh when it was
[1:43:29.720 --> 1:43:36.040]  less than 10 percent of 2016 i mean roger if these things pan out this is landslide victory
[1:43:36.040 --> 1:43:40.840]  territory for trump outside of any election interference uh what do you make about those
[1:43:40.840 --> 1:43:47.000]  polls uh how how much stake do you put in those polls as we get closer to the election well uh
[1:43:47.000 --> 1:43:53.080]  oh and i am optimistic i'm a bit more cautiously optimistic than you are but i do feel that the
[1:43:53.080 --> 1:44:01.640]  race is moving uh his way the president's way i do feel that you can see a shift which is trackable
[1:44:01.640 --> 1:44:08.200]  in most of these polls on the other hand i i'm still deeply concerned about voter fraud i'm
[1:44:08.200 --> 1:44:15.400]  still deeply concerned about internet censorship impacting the results uh i'm deeply concerned
[1:44:15.400 --> 1:44:22.520]  about the uh the therefore the rising importance yet again of the corporately owned media uh and
[1:44:22.520 --> 1:44:29.320]  i'll be candid with you we need debates joe biden has been a loudmouth braggart as opposed to the
[1:44:29.320 --> 1:44:37.640]  tough guy his whole life why is he afraid to debate he shouldn't be afraid it's cowardly i mean uh
[1:44:37.640 --> 1:44:43.560]  the guy needs to defend his positions uh he's got a long career in the senate he's got eight years
[1:44:43.560 --> 1:44:48.680]  as vice president he's an experienced speaker in orator what what is that he's afraid of why
[1:44:48.680 --> 1:44:54.760]  does he fear the non-politician donald trump i don't get it this guy has to be goaded relentlessly
[1:44:54.760 --> 1:45:01.240]  into debating because in all honesty his failure to debate might actually hurt him more than a bad
[1:45:01.240 --> 1:45:07.720]  debate would okay now he started getting into the debates there and that's really the big one
[1:45:07.720 --> 1:45:13.320]  but i totally agree with roger they're telling you that trump is ahead right now because they
[1:45:13.320 --> 1:45:19.320]  want you to not go out and vote they want to tell you stick with the plan don't go vote um trumps
[1:45:19.320 --> 1:45:24.440]  got it in the bag no he doesn't we're facing 80 million fake ballots mailed out to gum things up
[1:45:24.440 --> 1:45:29.560]  they're going to contest it they said they are and then try to split the country into and secede
[1:45:29.560 --> 1:45:34.680]  we're in the greatest crisis ever we are not in the catbird seat we are not in the pole position
[1:45:34.680 --> 1:45:41.800]  we're almost there but we do not have this in the bag the titanic on its maiden voyage said
[1:45:41.800 --> 1:45:50.520]  not even god can sink the ship and it sank if we were 20 points ahead i would say don't be arrogant
[1:45:53.400 --> 1:45:57.240]  we need to be absolutely engaged right now and exposing what's happening
[1:45:57.240 --> 1:46:01.880]  and yes of course it's emblematic of the collapsing system if they put a puppet
[1:46:01.880 --> 1:46:07.960]  who can't even talk like biden in that's because they'll do whatever they say he's so weak they
[1:46:07.960 --> 1:46:14.200]  want a puppet so they can broker power on who goes in and you got biden running around blaming
[1:46:14.200 --> 1:46:21.000]  trump of the riots this is incredible but here's roger getting into the debates itself this is
[1:46:21.000 --> 1:46:26.440]  really important information if he won't debate he should be disqualified i mean he can't be our
[1:46:26.440 --> 1:46:32.840]  president when he can't even leave his basement here it is well in these debates specifically
[1:46:32.840 --> 1:46:39.400]  the televised debates uh ever since they began have become so instrumental in people deciding
[1:46:39.400 --> 1:46:43.720]  who they vote for everybody knows that that's why they become such a big thing and you know with
[1:46:43.720 --> 1:46:48.520]  the makeup and the lights when you talk about the history but has there ever been a candidate
[1:46:48.520 --> 1:46:53.320]  roger i mean you've been studying politics for more than i've been alive not to age it's just
[1:46:53.320 --> 1:46:58.360]  your wisdom has there ever been a candidate that hasn't interviewed for the job of president has
[1:46:58.360 --> 1:47:03.240]  ever been a candidate that literally doesn't do press conferences or rallies and is now trying to
[1:47:03.240 --> 1:47:10.600]  skip the debates we've never seen a candidate hidden to the extent that this one is this has
[1:47:10.600 --> 1:47:19.080]  never happened historically now we had debates in 1960 we did not have them in 64 68 or 72
[1:47:19.080 --> 1:47:27.560]  then we've had them in every presidential contest since 1976 it is now a solid american tradition
[1:47:28.440 --> 1:47:33.400]  and people expect it particularly when there are questions let's be candid there are questions about
[1:47:33.400 --> 1:47:39.400]  both candidates and therefore people want to see the candidates perform they don't want to see them
[1:47:39.400 --> 1:47:46.040]  given some in the lab cognitive tests let's see them perform in real time let's see them under
[1:47:46.040 --> 1:47:54.040]  stress in the moment uh and see how they react to the drama and the uh and the high stakes of a
[1:47:54.040 --> 1:47:59.160]  of a vigorous debate you know i'll be honest with you oh and i prefer to see no moderates how about
[1:47:59.160 --> 1:48:05.560]  no moderates let's just let two men go toe to toe without moderates i totally agree with that the
[1:48:05.560 --> 1:48:10.760]  full clip is at man dot video but owen did a fabulous job so did roger stone speaking roger stone
[1:48:10.760 --> 1:48:16.040]  he'll be on the war room for an hour on tuesday night with owen shroyer find out about that at
[1:48:16.040 --> 1:48:25.480]  man dot video and on radio and tv stations across the country let me just get this out there if you
[1:48:25.480 --> 1:48:31.880]  go back to the lingon douglas debates or others the candidates would follow each other around
[1:48:31.880 --> 1:48:36.120]  and have dueling speeches that were then in the newspapers before they had tv or radio
[1:48:36.120 --> 1:48:42.280]  and so there was always been debates with presidential candidates that's why you used
[1:48:42.280 --> 1:48:48.040]  to have in big cities up to 10 newspapers that were daily you know one would come out is the
[1:48:48.040 --> 1:48:52.040]  early edition and everyone would come out in the morning edition one will be the afternoon edition
[1:48:52.040 --> 1:48:56.280]  you'd have the middle of the day edition and then the dinner edition the late night edition
[1:48:56.280 --> 1:49:00.760]  i mean they had all they had extras where oh you know sometimes big news is breaking the
[1:49:00.760 --> 1:49:04.520]  new york times would have three or four you know versions that day and so you'd see them
[1:49:04.520 --> 1:49:11.080]  debating and responding in live time in the written word and people back then didn't put up
[1:49:11.080 --> 1:49:15.000]  with it sometimes newspapers would get caught changing a quote boy they they'd be out of business
[1:49:15.000 --> 1:49:21.000]  quick i mean you screw people over you're you're done we need to get back to that but no now it's
[1:49:21.000 --> 1:49:25.560]  just networks telling you what they want you to hear but the public's been lied to so many times
[1:49:26.120 --> 1:49:31.800]  they finally know the truth i mean it was known within hours who the main suspect was shooting
[1:49:31.800 --> 1:49:37.320]  jbpship in portland and just an hour ago they had to come out and say the guy is the main suspect
[1:49:41.080 --> 1:49:46.280]  but it doesn't matter because we already knew so so the media is like oh we don't know oh
[1:49:46.280 --> 1:49:51.080]  on antifa got shot by a right winger everybody knew that wasn't true but the new york times
[1:49:51.080 --> 1:49:57.880]  was still on sunday saying that antifa was shot
[1:49:57.880 --> 1:50:05.480]  well when people see that type of garbage they never go back folks with the abuser
[1:50:07.160 --> 1:50:12.760]  all right um i need to hit this pentagon news and the coo news and then joey gibson of the
[1:50:12.760 --> 1:50:18.600]  patriot prayer group that founded it is going to join us with a good friend of jbpship uh fallen hero
[1:50:19.320 --> 1:50:23.160]  which handler papa's and and by the way jbpship is a is a fallen hero
[1:50:23.160 --> 1:50:29.480]  you know i think kyle up in uh wisconsin is a great patriot and a hero
[1:50:30.600 --> 1:50:36.840]  but he is facing life in prison for defending himself jbpship didn't even have a weapon he was
[1:50:36.840 --> 1:50:43.400]  murdered and uh his family needs to know he's a hero and he needs our support we should find
[1:50:43.400 --> 1:50:47.560]  about his family and we should try to financially support them because he's the type of people we
[1:50:47.560 --> 1:50:53.480]  can celebrate who are out there for us in the face of these dirty globalist scum
[1:50:55.240 --> 1:50:58.680]  who are trying to intimidate us if he wouldn't be intimidating he gave his life
[1:50:58.680 --> 1:51:01.720]  in america for free speech against these pieces of garbage

[1:52:31.000 --> 1:52:39.960]  don't let them take over america the social engineers bet on you not having a memory more
[1:52:39.960 --> 1:52:45.080]  than anything they also bet is they constantly talk about it in their own words that you will adapt
[1:52:45.080 --> 1:52:51.400]  to being a slave that you will learn incrementally to submit so think about and remember the phases
[1:52:51.400 --> 1:52:57.320]  of the Fauci fraud remember that everything he said has been a premeditated lie they lied about
[1:52:57.320 --> 1:53:02.440]  where it came from they lied about person to person the un covered it all up then exaggerated
[1:53:02.440 --> 1:53:10.440]  the death rate at four percent but it's actually 0.032 now and dropping then they set the test
[1:53:10.440 --> 1:53:15.160]  up to count almost all false positives they put the names of people that died of other diseases
[1:53:15.160 --> 1:53:19.960]  in the covet column they only said there'd be a 15 day lockdown now we're six months later
[1:53:19.960 --> 1:53:24.520]  now they say it's permanent you got to wear masks forever and forced inoculations are coming and
[1:53:24.520 --> 1:53:27.960]  they're going to track everywhere you go and what you do the global social credit score
[1:53:27.960 --> 1:53:32.600]  and the un is the boss anybody questioning it is censored off the internet loses their job
[1:53:32.600 --> 1:53:35.880]  that's called 21st century tyranny that's called world government takeover
[1:53:35.880 --> 1:53:51.800]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[1:53:54.600 --> 1:53:58.920]  coming up we'll show you the race war the left's trying to program
[1:53:59.880 --> 1:54:02.760]  shock video black man randomly knocks out white man with a brick
[1:54:02.760 --> 1:54:07.400]  we're not trying to blame black folks with this this is what the media is doing if the
[1:54:07.400 --> 1:54:11.480]  white guy randomly shooting a white guy to death with a black power tattoo on his neck if that's
[1:54:11.480 --> 1:54:16.840]  the guy tallahassee police real man who pulled pistol and viral protest confrontation lawfully
[1:54:16.840 --> 1:54:22.920]  defending himself that video is coming up and so much more video black voters break mainstream
[1:54:22.920 --> 1:54:30.920]  narrative with katelyn Bennett that's it band up video as well and then i've got all these stacks
[1:54:30.920 --> 1:54:38.680]  of news here where they're trying to keep churches in new york new jersey and california closed
[1:54:39.960 --> 1:54:46.120]  while they let leftists do whatever they want while they have the mtv awards the video music
[1:54:46.120 --> 1:54:51.480]  awards it's just it's just it's ridiculous you know well that's the point it's it's hypocrisy
[1:54:52.120 --> 1:54:53.960]  why are they doing it it's discriminatory
[1:54:53.960 --> 1:55:02.120]  because they're teaching you that they can do whatever they want whenever they want
[1:55:02.680 --> 1:55:08.760]  you can't go outside they can't it's called slavery i mean look at this from the mtv video awards
[1:55:10.120 --> 1:55:16.760]  it's lady gaga wearing her mask with devil horns coming out of the bottom of it and making the sign
[1:55:16.760 --> 1:55:27.400]  of say that's a brina branovich's uh little minion i mean what an empty desperate nobody
[1:55:30.920 --> 1:55:35.160]  that's all about how she's cool she's got the full backing of the big corporations the banks
[1:55:35.160 --> 1:55:41.320]  aren't all of you happy you're not her wearing a devil outfit while telling us oh we're not
[1:55:41.320 --> 1:55:46.520]  devil worshipers we're allowed to have our event you just you christians can't have or you jews or
[1:55:46.520 --> 1:55:55.320]  you muslims you can't have your event but we can have our event because they are completely and
[1:55:55.320 --> 1:56:01.640]  totally committed to evil what that means is selfishness but it's not just selfishness for them
[1:56:01.640 --> 1:56:08.440]  they have to carry it out for their god who demands the selfishness because their god wants to break up
[1:56:08.440 --> 1:56:15.960]  civilization and break up society and the only people that actually watch this at their mtv award
[1:56:15.960 --> 1:56:22.600]  trying to make the mask all cool to violate the quarantine rule to bring them in are children
[1:56:23.800 --> 1:56:25.000]  it's their only target
[1:56:27.800 --> 1:56:29.160]  it's for children to tune in
[1:56:29.160 --> 1:56:39.880]  and to see this and to think this is cool this is powerful this is something we want to be like
[1:56:43.560 --> 1:56:48.600]  and all it is is a bunch of nerds and a bunch of nobodies who think the devil's gonna give them
[1:56:48.600 --> 1:56:53.560]  power and the devil's not gonna give them power the devil's gonna give them death
[1:56:53.560 --> 1:57:02.760]  the devil equals death death equals the devil death death death and you're all gonna find that out
[1:57:03.720 --> 1:57:09.640]  that serves satan soon enough because the devil equals death death equals the devil
[1:57:12.760 --> 1:57:14.280]  that's what they say it's coming bones
[1:57:14.280 --> 1:57:24.200]  and all these people want to be is a vessel of satan
[1:57:25.480 --> 1:57:30.520]  and to sit there with kids and everybody watching us being smothered us artificially with faith
[1:57:30.520 --> 1:57:37.880]  suckers alien face suckers on our face showing that we're in subservience to bill gates and his
[1:57:37.880 --> 1:57:46.120]  giant lie and then they get some fake award out of the rear end of subner redstone the mtv award
[1:57:50.200 --> 1:57:56.600]  it's truly a sick joke these are lost people they can't even rule their own lives and project
[1:57:56.600 --> 1:58:02.200]  their hate of themselves onto us and then hope will all die so they could then be alone because
[1:58:02.200 --> 1:58:07.720]  they're so ashamed of themselves well guess what we're gonna figure our way out of this with god
[1:58:07.720 --> 1:58:11.960] 's help and their whole system's going down and yeah it's going to take the blood of patriots and
[1:58:11.960 --> 1:58:18.280]  tyrants to water that tree of liberty as thomas everson said but i tell you i don't want the
[1:58:18.280 --> 1:58:27.240]  blood of that method that killed jay bishops you know i don't want his blood i want the blood
[1:58:27.240 --> 1:58:33.080]  of those that sent him and controlled him and twisted him in the forges of hell and i know god's
[1:58:33.080 --> 1:58:39.480]  a just god and i know god always gets me what i want so pray for vengeance it is the lord's
[1:58:49.320 --> 1:58:56.040]  you hear that that's the march of the united nations and the bill of malinda gates foundation
[1:58:56.040 --> 1:59:02.840]  coming with their battle plan psychological warfare operation with the forced inoculations
[1:59:03.400 --> 1:59:08.840]  and the permanent lockdown of civilization and society they're outlawing people being able to
[1:59:08.840 --> 1:59:14.520]  get colds or the flu they're creating artificial phobias for normal death that takes place they're
[1:59:14.520 --> 1:59:20.520]  not even promising to have a cure to it all they're just inflicting new phobias on everyone to bring
[1:59:20.520 --> 1:59:28.040]  in their planetary regime directed by the who with vaccines that actually change your dna and make
[1:59:28.040 --> 1:59:39.720]  you owned by microsoft it's a final frontier it's the year 2020 it's not coming it's here and submission
[1:59:39.720 --> 1:59:52.280]  is blood in the water
[1:59:56.120 --> 2:00:04.280]  the answer to 1984 is 1776 you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:00:04.280 --> 2:00:12.840]  so
[2:00:13.560 --> 2:00:20.120]  well my friends uh this is not awake but it but it but it feels like one right now j bishops
[2:00:20.120 --> 2:00:25.560]  was a great patriot a good guy and all he did was go out and stand up for the first amendment
[2:00:25.560 --> 2:00:33.000]  non-violently and he was executed by a soros demon saturday night and i've known joey gibson
[2:00:33.000 --> 2:00:37.160]  i guess three four years for this patriot parent group it seems like a hundred years
[2:00:37.160 --> 2:00:42.440]  and he was there and the good friend of j bishops who was murdered by the communist uh
[2:00:42.440 --> 2:00:46.040]  channel where poppus was there and and thought he might have been shot when they in the gun at him
[2:00:46.040 --> 2:00:51.240]  and shot uh and you see the media saying oh we don't know if it's political and they were being
[2:00:51.240 --> 2:00:56.200]  stalked by these people and they say we've got us a trump or we've got us a trump or and you watch
[2:00:56.200 --> 2:01:01.640]  this this is the real world they're trying to say oh they're heroes and the very people that
[2:01:01.640 --> 2:01:07.560]  chased down kyle rittenhouse and said i wish we could kill him and and and tried to shoot him
[2:01:07.560 --> 2:01:12.920]  you know they're celebrated as heroes but then when j bishops is murdered they won't even say his
[2:01:12.920 --> 2:01:17.640]  name they won't even talk about really happening and then now that the person that was fingered
[2:01:17.640 --> 2:01:23.400]  by witnesses is is the main suspect we're gonna talk about it all here today with channeler poppus
[2:01:23.400 --> 2:01:28.280]  his friend and a founder of the patriot parent group uh of course uh as well but who's died as
[2:01:28.280 --> 2:01:32.440]  j bishops but i thought for tv viewers radio listeners it's hard to watch but let's go ahead
[2:01:32.440 --> 2:01:36.440]  and play the video shot from multiple angles of them saying we've got us a trump or pull it out here
[2:01:36.440 --> 2:01:41.560]  he is right here then they shoot him twice in the chest right next to uh channeler poppus uh and
[2:01:41.560 --> 2:02:00.040]  then you can see the footage of uh poor a j bishop going on to meet the next level here it is
[2:02:12.120 --> 2:02:18.040]  oh
[2:02:18.040 --> 2:02:20.040]  You're just pulling it out, right here.
[2:02:20.040 --> 2:02:21.040]  You okay?
[2:02:28.040 --> 2:02:29.040]  You okay?
[2:02:29.040 --> 2:02:30.040]  Okay.
[2:02:31.040 --> 2:02:32.040]  No.
[2:02:32.040 --> 2:02:33.040]  Okay.
[2:02:38.040 --> 2:02:39.040]  Watch out, bro.
[2:02:39.040 --> 2:02:41.040]  She's trying to help him.
[2:02:41.040 --> 2:02:42.040]  She's trying to help him.
[2:02:42.040 --> 2:02:44.040]  She's the next one to help him.
[2:02:44.040 --> 2:02:45.040]  So lay down and help.
[2:02:45.040 --> 2:02:48.040]  Hey, down and help.
[2:02:48.040 --> 2:02:51.040]  Do you need ambulance?
[2:02:51.040 --> 2:02:53.040]  Gracie, do you need ambulance?
[2:02:53.040 --> 2:02:54.040]  Yeah, follow your mother.
[2:02:54.040 --> 2:02:55.040]  Come on.
[2:02:55.040 --> 2:02:58.040]  The added touches of BLM with Andy Bush,
[2:02:58.040 --> 2:02:59.040]  shouting over them saying,
[2:02:59.040 --> 2:03:00.040]  don't help him.
[2:03:00.040 --> 2:03:01.040]  Help this woman.
[2:03:01.040 --> 2:03:02.040]  Truly sick evil people.
[2:03:02.040 --> 2:03:03.040]  It's like when they pull that guy out
[2:03:03.040 --> 2:03:05.040]  and beat his girlfriend up and attacked him
[2:03:05.040 --> 2:03:06.040]  and they kept kicking him in the head
[2:03:06.040 --> 2:03:07.040]  and saying, get up.
[2:03:07.040 --> 2:03:08.040]  You're not hurt.
[2:03:08.040 --> 2:03:09.040]  I know it's probably hard,
[2:03:09.040 --> 2:03:10.040]  very hard for Chandler Pappas
[2:03:10.040 --> 2:03:11.040]  to be watching this.
[2:03:11.040 --> 2:03:12.040]  He was there.
[2:03:12.040 --> 2:03:14.040]  So it's got to be hard to be reliving this.
[2:03:14.040 --> 2:03:16.040]  We really appreciate his courage
[2:03:16.040 --> 2:03:17.040]  and what he's done.
[2:03:17.040 --> 2:03:20.040]  So I'm going to bring the founder
[2:03:20.040 --> 2:03:22.040]  of the Patriot prayer group,
[2:03:22.040 --> 2:03:24.040]  Joey Gibson up here.
[2:03:24.040 --> 2:03:26.040]  And of course, Chandler Pappas for the rest of the hour.
[2:03:26.040 --> 2:03:28.040]  And I think I'm just going to try to be quiet
[2:03:28.040 --> 2:03:30.040]  because I can talk a lot as you guys know.
[2:03:30.040 --> 2:03:32.040]  And just let you guys have the floor here
[2:03:32.040 --> 2:03:34.040]  between Joey Gibson,
[2:03:34.040 --> 2:03:37.040]  PatriotPrayerUSA.com and Chandler Pappas.
[2:03:37.040 --> 2:03:39.040]  So go ahead, Joey,
[2:03:39.040 --> 2:03:41.040]  and you lead us for the rest of the hour here.
[2:03:41.040 --> 2:03:42.040]  And what's happened?
[2:03:42.040 --> 2:03:44.040]  I know you couldn't even come on your stay.
[2:03:44.040 --> 2:03:46.040]  It was with your family and their family
[2:03:46.040 --> 2:03:48.040]  and everybody was too upset about this.
[2:03:48.040 --> 2:03:50.040]  And then to watch the left is celebrating
[2:03:50.040 --> 2:03:52.040]  and saying you deserve to die
[2:03:52.040 --> 2:03:54.040]  and the media is celebrating it, truly sick.
[2:03:54.040 --> 2:03:56.040]  So our prayers are all with you.
[2:03:56.040 --> 2:03:58.040]  We appreciate you standing up for the First Amendment.
[2:04:00.040 --> 2:04:02.040]  Yo, I appreciate you having us.
[2:04:02.040 --> 2:04:04.040]  The first thing I want to say is that
[2:04:04.040 --> 2:04:07.040]  yesterday, Chandler was feeling the same way.
[2:04:07.040 --> 2:04:09.040]  It's not something we were excited to do
[2:04:09.040 --> 2:04:11.040]  to go out there and do interviews.
[2:04:11.040 --> 2:04:13.040]  But then last night, you know,
[2:04:13.040 --> 2:04:15.040]  sitting there watching Ted Miller,
[2:04:15.040 --> 2:04:18.040]  and he has the nerve to go on public television
[2:04:18.040 --> 2:04:21.040]  and blame the fact that Jay was shot
[2:04:21.040 --> 2:04:23.040]  and he blamed that on President Trump,
[2:04:23.040 --> 2:04:26.040]  blamed it on everybody else except for his own policies
[2:04:26.040 --> 2:04:27.040]  in this city.
[2:04:27.040 --> 2:04:29.040]  If anybody knew Jay at all, anybody,
[2:04:29.040 --> 2:04:31.040]  I don't care if you're far left,
[2:04:31.040 --> 2:04:32.040]  whatever your ideology is,
[2:04:32.040 --> 2:04:34.040]  if you actually knew him as a person,
[2:04:34.040 --> 2:04:37.040]  you would never attack him, let alone kill him.
[2:04:37.040 --> 2:04:39.040]  So the reason why this has happened
[2:04:39.040 --> 2:04:42.040]  and why this happens in other cities around the country
[2:04:42.040 --> 2:04:45.040]  is because they have a culture of lawlessness
[2:04:45.040 --> 2:04:47.040]  and we also have people who lie.
[2:04:47.040 --> 2:04:49.040]  We have the media who lies about conservatives
[2:04:49.040 --> 2:04:51.040]  and Christians nonstop.
[2:04:51.040 --> 2:04:53.040]  We have politicians like Ted Wheeler
[2:04:53.040 --> 2:04:55.040]  who constantly lies about conservatives and Christians
[2:04:55.040 --> 2:04:57.040]  calling them white supremacists
[2:04:57.040 --> 2:04:59.040]  and so they drum up all this hatred.
[2:04:59.040 --> 2:05:02.040]  This is what caused a guy to randomly come across the street
[2:05:02.040 --> 2:05:05.040]  and just shoot somebody that he doesn't even know.
[2:05:05.040 --> 2:05:08.040]  And again, Joey, I'm going to let you lead this,
[2:05:08.040 --> 2:05:10.040]  you're an experienced talk show host.
[2:05:10.040 --> 2:05:11.040]  I don't want to erupt.
[2:05:11.040 --> 2:05:12.040]  I mean, exactly.
[2:05:12.040 --> 2:05:14.040]  I didn't want to talk about personal stuff.
[2:05:14.040 --> 2:05:17.040]  You didn't feel it was proper to even talk after he died
[2:05:17.040 --> 2:05:19.040]  and neither did anybody else.
[2:05:19.040 --> 2:05:20.040]  And you guys were too hurt.
[2:05:20.040 --> 2:05:21.040]  I know that you were good friends with him,
[2:05:21.040 --> 2:05:22.040]  especially Chandler,
[2:05:22.040 --> 2:05:24.040]  but now because of them lying about him,
[2:05:24.040 --> 2:05:26.040]  you guys are forced to right now.
[2:05:27.040 --> 2:05:28.040]  So here's the thing.
[2:05:28.040 --> 2:05:32.040]  When we pulled up to the body,
[2:05:32.040 --> 2:05:34.040]  what they're saying is that a white supremacist
[2:05:34.040 --> 2:05:36.040]  shot some black guy, right?
[2:05:36.040 --> 2:05:40.040]  Then they say, oh, fascist killed some comrade.
[2:05:40.040 --> 2:05:41.040]  Okay, the lies kept going.
[2:05:41.040 --> 2:05:43.040]  And now they're sitting here and they're trying to claim
[2:05:43.040 --> 2:05:45.040]  that Jay is a white supremacist,
[2:05:45.040 --> 2:05:47.040]  but they don't even know who he is.
[2:05:47.040 --> 2:05:49.040]  There's no bit of evidence at all.
[2:05:49.040 --> 2:05:51.040]  People don't even know his real name.
[2:05:51.040 --> 2:05:52.040]  He wasn't on social media.
[2:05:52.040 --> 2:05:54.040]  They don't know anything about him.
[2:05:54.040 --> 2:05:55.040]  And this is what they do.
[2:05:55.040 --> 2:05:57.040]  They dehumanize us on purpose.
[2:05:57.040 --> 2:05:59.040]  They dehumanize us to the point where these people
[2:05:59.040 --> 2:06:02.040]  have the nerve to get on that bullhorn.
[2:06:02.040 --> 2:06:04.040]  Later on that evening, when they,
[2:06:04.040 --> 2:06:06.040]  and they celebrate it by saying, oh,
[2:06:06.040 --> 2:06:08.040]  we killed a fascist tonight.
[2:06:08.040 --> 2:06:10.040]  And they all cheer like a bunch of children.
[2:06:10.040 --> 2:06:11.040]  Like this is some game.
[2:06:11.040 --> 2:06:13.040]  They dehumanize us on purpose.
[2:06:13.040 --> 2:06:17.040]  And she doesn't know a damn thing about Jay or who he is,
[2:06:17.040 --> 2:06:20.040]  but she stands there and just makes that claim,
[2:06:20.040 --> 2:06:22.040]  makes that claim to cover who they are
[2:06:22.040 --> 2:06:24.040]  and what their intents are.
[2:06:24.040 --> 2:06:27.040]  And so Chandler was the one that was right there.
[2:06:27.040 --> 2:06:28.040]  And so I think it's a-
[2:06:28.040 --> 2:06:29.040]  That's right.
[2:06:29.040 --> 2:06:30.040]  Chandler was what's popping in Chandler.
[2:06:30.040 --> 2:06:32.040]  I know it's hard for you to talk.
[2:06:32.040 --> 2:06:33.040]  You were there.
[2:06:33.040 --> 2:06:35.040]  I mean, just what do you want to say first here, brother?
[2:06:35.040 --> 2:06:37.040]  We're glad you're alive.
[2:06:37.040 --> 2:06:38.040]  Thank you.
[2:06:38.040 --> 2:06:39.040]  I mean, it's 50-50 shot.
[2:06:39.040 --> 2:06:40.040]  It was me or Jay.
[2:06:40.040 --> 2:06:42.040]  And I think I'm...
[2:06:42.040 --> 2:06:43.040]  It takes a minute to process.
[2:06:43.040 --> 2:06:45.040]  Jay was a good man.
[2:06:45.040 --> 2:06:46.040]  He was a good dude.
[2:06:46.040 --> 2:06:48.040]  Anybody who knew him would tell you that.
[2:06:48.040 --> 2:06:50.040]  He's kind and he's compassionate.
[2:06:50.040 --> 2:06:51.040]  He was a good guy.
[2:06:51.040 --> 2:06:53.040]  So it was really hard, especially to lose him.
[2:06:53.040 --> 2:06:57.040]  And then to turn around for Ted Wheeler and Kate Brown
[2:06:57.040 --> 2:06:59.040]  to try to blame this on Donald Trump
[2:06:59.040 --> 2:07:03.040]  and call us these alt-right and whatever other...
[2:07:03.040 --> 2:07:04.040]  And Joe Biden.
[2:07:04.040 --> 2:07:07.040]  Joe Biden blamed it on Trump.
[2:07:07.040 --> 2:07:10.040]  Of course he did.
[2:07:10.040 --> 2:07:11.040]  Of course he did.
[2:07:11.040 --> 2:07:12.040]  Sorry.
[2:07:12.040 --> 2:07:13.040]  Keep going, brother.
[2:07:13.040 --> 2:07:14.040]  I don't want to interrupt you.
[2:07:14.040 --> 2:07:15.040]  Just let it all out.
[2:07:15.040 --> 2:07:16.040]  What did you witness?
[2:07:16.040 --> 2:07:17.040]  Put on record.
[2:07:17.040 --> 2:07:18.040]  They don't want you to have a voice.
[2:07:18.040 --> 2:07:19.040]  They didn't want us to have a voice.
[2:07:19.040 --> 2:07:20.040]  We have a voice.
[2:07:20.040 --> 2:07:21.040]  Tell folks what happened.
[2:07:21.040 --> 2:07:23.040]  It wasn't a black guy getting shot.
[2:07:23.040 --> 2:07:25.040]  Jay wasn't a white supremacist.
[2:07:25.040 --> 2:07:28.040]  You let these demons know the truth.
[2:07:28.040 --> 2:07:29.040]  Yeah.
[2:07:29.040 --> 2:07:30.040]  They hunted us down.
[2:07:30.040 --> 2:07:31.040]  And they saw us.
[2:07:31.040 --> 2:07:33.040]  They recognized the Patriot bear hat.
[2:07:33.040 --> 2:07:35.040]  And they hunted us down with the intent to kill us.
[2:07:35.040 --> 2:07:37.040]  And they did kill Jay.
[2:07:37.040 --> 2:07:39.040]  They got away with that.
[2:07:39.040 --> 2:07:40.040]  He's gone.
[2:07:40.040 --> 2:07:42.040]  Whether this guy gets convicted or not,
[2:07:42.040 --> 2:07:45.040]  he achieved his goal and he killed somebody.
[2:07:45.040 --> 2:07:49.040]  Because he believes something different.
[2:07:49.040 --> 2:07:51.040]  It's just evil.
[2:07:51.040 --> 2:07:52.040]  There's no rhyme or reason.
[2:07:52.040 --> 2:07:53.040]  There's no logic.
[2:07:53.040 --> 2:07:54.040]  It's not rational.
[2:07:54.040 --> 2:07:57.040]  They're just wickedness.
[2:07:57.040 --> 2:07:58.040]  It is wickedness.
[2:07:58.040 --> 2:08:02.040]  They just want to overthrow things.
[2:08:02.040 --> 2:08:03.040]  Yeah.
[2:08:03.040 --> 2:08:04.040]  And we can't let them.
[2:08:04.040 --> 2:08:06.040]  And something I learned reading the Federalist papers recently,
[2:08:06.040 --> 2:08:08.040]  our whole system is really designed for gridlock.
[2:08:08.040 --> 2:08:12.040]  It's designed for this not to happen until we are so polluted,
[2:08:12.040 --> 2:08:17.040]  completely permeated with wickedness and evil that they can get away with this.
[2:08:17.040 --> 2:08:20.040]  And we're at that point.
[2:08:20.040 --> 2:08:21.040]  You're right.
[2:08:21.040 --> 2:08:23.040]  It was cooked up by the chai comms and sorrows.
[2:08:23.040 --> 2:08:25.040]  This is their attack.
[2:08:25.040 --> 2:08:26.040]  Joey?
[2:08:26.040 --> 2:08:31.040]  Well, in the Insleys and the Newsom and the Browns and all these people
[2:08:31.040 --> 2:08:34.040]  that are in power, they're wicked.
[2:08:34.040 --> 2:08:36.040]  Everybody that's letting them get away with this,
[2:08:36.040 --> 2:08:39.040]  everybody that's encouraging these riots, AOC,
[2:08:39.040 --> 2:08:41.040]  underhandedly provoking things online.
[2:08:41.040 --> 2:08:46.040]  Everybody who's doing this is wicked and they're doing it with evil intent.
[2:08:46.040 --> 2:08:49.040]  Also, Ted Wheeler and Joan Hatterstein,
[2:08:49.040 --> 2:08:51.040]  the mayor and the commissioner,
[2:08:51.040 --> 2:08:57.040]  she's constantly calling people like Patriot prayer, white supremacists and racist and white nationalists.
[2:08:57.040 --> 2:08:59.040]  I blame her for this.
[2:08:59.040 --> 2:09:03.040]  I blame the fact that Ted Wheeler sits there and lies into the camera every single time
[2:09:03.040 --> 2:09:07.040]  talking about these far-right extremists calling us racist and white supremacists,
[2:09:07.040 --> 2:09:08.040]  jumping up that.
[2:09:08.040 --> 2:09:11.040]  The fact that they don't have any law and order in these cities.
[2:09:11.040 --> 2:09:16.040]  And then he turns around and has a nerve to point his finger at President Trump.
[2:09:16.040 --> 2:09:18.040]  President Trump is sitting there saying,
[2:09:18.040 --> 2:09:21.040]  do you want the help? Just ask for it.
[2:09:21.040 --> 2:09:23.040]  Ted Wheeler has been ruining this city.
[2:09:23.040 --> 2:09:25.040]  All the business owners know this.
[2:09:25.040 --> 2:09:26.040]  They're sick and tired of him.
[2:09:26.040 --> 2:09:27.040]  He's nothing but talk.
[2:09:27.040 --> 2:09:28.040]  He has no plans.
[2:09:28.040 --> 2:09:30.040]  He's just a puppet.
[2:09:30.040 --> 2:09:32.040]  Joey Gibson.
[2:09:32.040 --> 2:09:36.040]  We're remembering Jay Bishop here and what comes next with the suspect at large.
[2:09:36.040 --> 2:09:38.040]  Let's cover what happened last night, what you witnessed,
[2:09:38.040 --> 2:09:42.040]  what's coming next and then the election 63 days outside with us.
[2:09:42.040 --> 2:09:49.040]  It was in the Telecommunications Act of 1996 that all new cell phones would track your GPS location.
[2:09:49.040 --> 2:09:55.040]  I read from the federal law and listeners couldn't believe me because that was un-American.
[2:09:55.040 --> 2:10:01.040]  Now the media admits that almost every app and every company that are on Apple and on Droids,
[2:10:01.040 --> 2:10:05.040]  don't just track your location but your surfing history, where you go,
[2:10:05.040 --> 2:10:10.040]  who you talk to, your relationships and they all share the data with each other
[2:10:10.040 --> 2:10:14.040]  and what you're doing on the apps as well including having apps turn on
[2:10:14.040 --> 2:10:18.040]  and listen to what you're saying just like Siri or Alexa do
[2:10:18.040 --> 2:10:24.040]  and then putting databases, transcripts of everything you say into those systems to be saved forever.
[2:10:24.040 --> 2:10:29.040]  Your phone is spying on you and companies are generating secret surveillance scores based on information.
[2:10:29.040 --> 2:10:32.040]  This is the Global Chinese Communist Social Credit Score.

[2:10:42.040 --> 2:10:45.040]  This isn't about me taking credit. In fact, it's the opposite.
[2:10:45.040 --> 2:10:49.040]  It's about getting you to understand that you have all the power.
[2:10:49.040 --> 2:10:53.040]  Going back three weeks ago, they had the entire Austin Greenbelt shutdown
[2:10:53.040 --> 2:10:59.040]  and they had the spillway by Barton Springs shutdown as well as the main pool
[2:10:59.040 --> 2:11:04.040]  that's always been paying for the last 50 years or so. It's a damned up spring.
[2:11:04.040 --> 2:11:10.040]  Well, we went down there and we got in the park at different areas around town
[2:11:10.040 --> 2:11:14.040]  in the last few weeks and educated people that it was all a giant fraud
[2:11:14.040 --> 2:11:18.040]  and now despite the fact that they still say the parks are closed, you get out to any area.
[2:11:18.040 --> 2:11:22.040]  You'll see dozens if not hundreds of people depending where you're at
[2:11:22.040 --> 2:11:25.040]  actually using Barton Springs there in Austin, Texas.
[2:11:25.040 --> 2:11:28.040]  So Bill Gates and the Globalists give the orders to the UN.
[2:11:28.040 --> 2:11:33.040]  The UN gives the orders down through the National Health Services like our NIH
[2:11:33.040 --> 2:11:38.040]  to help follow it like dutiful slaves. Stop complying with your own enslavement.
[2:11:38.040 --> 2:11:42.040]  Stop following the orders of these globalist traders. Start being free again.
[2:11:45.040 --> 2:11:49.040]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[2:11:49.040 --> 2:11:55.040]  Welcome back. I'm Alex Jones, your host. You know, this is a personal thing for me.
[2:11:55.040 --> 2:12:01.040]  And I don't say this to put myself in the story. Anytime we go out in public in Austin,
[2:12:01.040 --> 2:12:05.040]  that means to take my wife to dinner, to take my children to the park.
[2:12:05.040 --> 2:12:10.040]  I have to be ready for a leftist who aren't just anti for the main line leftist now
[2:12:10.040 --> 2:12:13.040]  to throw drinks in my face.
[2:12:13.040 --> 2:12:19.040]  To knock my food over. To walk over to my table and say, I'm going to kill you,
[2:12:19.040 --> 2:12:23.040]  hoping to get me angry. If I get up and say something, they then edit the tape.
[2:12:23.040 --> 2:12:27.040]  Luckily, the statesman one time went down to the chicken place and they said,
[2:12:27.040 --> 2:12:31.040]  no, they threatened to attack Jones three times before he got up in front of them.
[2:12:31.040 --> 2:12:34.040]  But more and more media won't even tell the truth and that happens.
[2:12:34.040 --> 2:12:40.040]  This man, Jay Bishop, let's talk about who he was, is out there with the Patriot Paragroup
[2:12:40.040 --> 2:12:45.040]  and they're just doing a caravan. And then what happened or how are you out of the vehicles?
[2:12:45.040 --> 2:12:48.040]  There was this individual stalking. They're saying he's the main suspect.
[2:12:48.040 --> 2:12:52.040]  You were there. Chandler Pappas is friend. You could have been shot.
[2:12:52.040 --> 2:12:57.040]  Does it look like the guy? You guys have the floor here and you can lead it.
[2:12:57.040 --> 2:13:02.040]  Chandler, you can lead it. Jay's friend, you can lead it.
[2:13:02.040 --> 2:13:06.040]  Here, Joey Gibson, because I feel like you're the experts. You're in the middle of it.
[2:13:06.040 --> 2:13:10.040]  You founded Patriot Prayer. Let's start there. Joey, what is Patriot Prayer?
[2:13:10.040 --> 2:13:14.040]  Because they wanted to find what it is. What is it really? I've been to your events.
[2:13:14.040 --> 2:13:19.040]  It's black, white, Hispanic, old, young. I mean, people of different colors,
[2:13:19.040 --> 2:13:24.040]  but all the guys do look pretty masculine, pretty tough. John Wayne types.
[2:13:24.040 --> 2:13:28.040]  I mean, all you guys are not wimps, but the colors, different colors,
[2:13:28.040 --> 2:13:31.040]  but everybody looks like men. The women look like women.
[2:13:31.040 --> 2:13:34.040]  I mean, I think that's how it described you as red-blooded.
[2:13:34.040 --> 2:13:39.040]  Yeah. I saw, 2016, I saw the left pretty much own the activist community.
[2:13:39.040 --> 2:13:44.040]  And so Patriot Prayer was an attempt to get a grassroots movement to get,
[2:13:44.040 --> 2:13:47.040]  you know, people who believe in freedom and God, well, you don't have to believe in God,
[2:13:47.040 --> 2:13:53.040]  but God's definitely a big part of the speeches to get people to simply stand up
[2:13:53.040 --> 2:13:58.040]  and to stop conforming, stop complying, stop laying down as these people are destroying
[2:13:58.040 --> 2:14:03.040]  our country as the elitists who have lost their lives.
[2:14:03.040 --> 2:14:08.040]  The elitists who've infiltrated all levels of the government from city to federal
[2:14:08.040 --> 2:14:12.040]  to stand up against them and call them out. And so it's been a battle.
[2:14:12.040 --> 2:14:18.040]  It's been very difficult. And I'll tell you this much that people who do stand with Patriot Prayer,
[2:14:18.040 --> 2:14:23.040]  you know, like Chandler and like Jay, it takes a special amount of courage over here
[2:14:23.040 --> 2:14:26.040]  in the West Coast and especially in the Portland area.
[2:14:26.040 --> 2:14:30.040]  That's right. Because you're in Mordor. You're in the lion's den.
[2:14:30.040 --> 2:14:35.040]  Yeah. And Jay had always been there at any time, always been there.
[2:14:35.040 --> 2:14:38.040]  He lives in the city of Portland, like in the beast.
[2:14:38.040 --> 2:14:41.040]  And he's always been there to support us, to protect us.
[2:14:41.040 --> 2:14:44.040]  He's never gotten mad, not never gotten angry.
[2:14:44.040 --> 2:14:48.040]  He has an amazing heart. And I'm not just saying that because he passed away.
[2:14:48.040 --> 2:14:53.040]  I'm telling you, it's the truth. Like he was such a great guy and so much fun.
[2:14:53.040 --> 2:14:59.040]  And he's always smiling and he's been there from the very beginning, never caused any problems.
[2:14:59.040 --> 2:15:01.040]  And then what does it like to watch them? I hate to play the video.
[2:15:01.040 --> 2:15:03.040]  I don't know if Chandler, you can even handle it.
[2:15:03.040 --> 2:15:05.040]  No, you've seen the video of this.
[2:15:05.040 --> 2:15:08.040]  It's just something about her being an overweight commando.
[2:15:08.040 --> 2:15:12.040]  And I'm overweight too, but I mean, really overweight, like 400 pound woman saying,
[2:15:12.040 --> 2:15:15.040]  we killed a Nazi, we killed a fascist, defaming someone.
[2:15:15.040 --> 2:15:21.040]  They just murdered and getting off on it.
[2:15:21.040 --> 2:15:26.040]  Yeah. I mean, there's only a couple of ways you can really feel about that.
[2:15:26.040 --> 2:15:32.040]  It's sickening. It's almost saddening too that that's where these people's mind is at.
[2:15:32.040 --> 2:15:37.040]  That it's more important to them to kill the opposition than to come to a solution.
[2:15:37.040 --> 2:15:40.040]  We're all Americans. We all have a First Amendment.
[2:15:40.040 --> 2:15:43.040]  We all have the right to freedom of self-expression and speech.
[2:15:43.040 --> 2:15:51.040]  And the amount of hate that's there, it still throws me off.
[2:15:51.040 --> 2:15:57.040]  Now, the media got the name wrong, said Jay Bishop. How do people really support the real guy that died?
[2:15:57.040 --> 2:16:00.040]  How do they do that? Talk about that.
[2:16:00.040 --> 2:16:05.040]  I think you always got the GoFundMe right there. That's the one.
[2:16:05.040 --> 2:16:09.040]  GoFundMe, unfortunately, I believe some lefty put up a fake GoFundMe.
[2:16:09.040 --> 2:16:13.040]  So that's it right there. Aaron Danielson, official GoFundMe page.
[2:16:13.040 --> 2:16:17.040]  You can search that. Definitely put some links up all over the place.
[2:16:17.040 --> 2:16:21.040]  We got to put that up. So that's for his basically his brother,
[2:16:21.040 --> 2:16:25.040]  not his blood brother, but his brother, his best friend, business partner,
[2:16:25.040 --> 2:16:28.040]  guy who knew him best, closest to him.
[2:16:28.040 --> 2:16:33.040]  And so he's just torn apart. And so we want to support him as much as possible.
[2:16:33.040 --> 2:16:37.040]  Obviously, no amount of money can, you know, take care of what had happened.
[2:16:37.040 --> 2:16:41.040]  But this is the way for the people to come together and to support him.
[2:16:41.040 --> 2:16:44.040]  I mean, that should be $100,000.
[2:16:44.040 --> 2:16:48.040]  That's right. So give the real name out because they went with Jay.
[2:16:48.040 --> 2:16:49.040]  That was his nickname.
[2:16:49.040 --> 2:16:53.040]  But give people for radio listeners the real proper name here. So we get this right.
[2:16:53.040 --> 2:16:56.040]  Aaron J. Danielson.
[2:16:56.040 --> 2:17:02.040]  Aaron J. Danielson. And that's a GoFundMe $27,000 for his family and the funeral
[2:17:02.040 --> 2:17:07.040]  and all the rest of people should go donate there.
[2:17:07.040 --> 2:17:12.040]  I wonder why the media got the name J Bishop in there.
[2:17:12.040 --> 2:17:15.040]  Well, that's because the J likes to go by different names at times.
[2:17:15.040 --> 2:17:22.040]  But one of the main reasons is because there's a fake GoFundMe page up and they went by Jay Bishop.
[2:17:22.040 --> 2:17:27.040]  And Jay Bishop is actually a guy a couple of years back who got arrested for,
[2:17:27.040 --> 2:17:29.040]  I don't know, having a gun and some other things.
[2:17:29.040 --> 2:17:32.040]  So I don't know. I think they're trying to attach him to that name.
[2:17:32.040 --> 2:17:38.040]  But Jay wasn't the type of guy that was all over social media.
[2:17:38.040 --> 2:17:41.040]  He just showed up in person because he didn't want to be harassed and targeted.
[2:17:41.040 --> 2:17:43.040]  That's why I get it.
[2:17:43.040 --> 2:17:45.040]  Yeah, absolutely.
[2:17:45.040 --> 2:17:48.040]  Guys, I can ask a thousand questions. What do you want to say right now?
[2:17:48.040 --> 2:17:52.040]  There's so many angles to this.
[2:17:52.040 --> 2:17:56.040]  I mean, I've been talking about it for the last 24 hours.
[2:17:56.040 --> 2:18:00.040]  It seems like I haven't gotten off the phone.
[2:18:00.040 --> 2:18:05.040]  It's a tragedy. It's wrong.
[2:18:05.040 --> 2:18:09.040]  Man, I can just go over it.
[2:18:09.040 --> 2:18:11.040]  What do you want to ask us? Ask me something.
[2:18:11.040 --> 2:18:13.040]  I'm going to ask you a million questions.
[2:18:13.040 --> 2:18:17.040]  I can go back to that night and go back to the media and go back to Joe Biden saying that Trump started all this.
[2:18:17.040 --> 2:18:25.040]  I mean, this is crazy that since Rittenhouse defended himself and shot those people that had guns trying to kill him,
[2:18:25.040 --> 2:18:28.040]  they're now just saying it's already in LA and all over.
[2:18:28.040 --> 2:18:30.040]  They're now shooting at vehicles.
[2:18:30.040 --> 2:18:32.040]  Clearly the next wave of the war is here.
[2:18:32.040 --> 2:18:36.040]  Now things are going to a shooting war.
[2:18:36.040 --> 2:18:39.040]  I would like to say something on that.
[2:18:39.040 --> 2:18:45.040]  The city of Portland and some of these cities that are highly dangerous with no law and order,
[2:18:45.040 --> 2:18:49.040]  all these are far left cities, Democrat controlled.
[2:18:49.040 --> 2:18:51.040]  We don't need to go in there for revenge.
[2:18:51.040 --> 2:18:54.040]  We don't even need these Antifa and BLM types.
[2:18:54.040 --> 2:18:56.040]  There's no saving them.
[2:18:56.040 --> 2:19:00.040]  When you're out there celebrating a man's death, it's done.
[2:19:00.040 --> 2:19:02.040]  There's nothing you can do for them.
[2:19:02.040 --> 2:19:04.040]  What we need to do is we need to protect our communities.
[2:19:04.040 --> 2:19:12.040]  If you live outside of these big cities like I do, I live maybe 15 minutes in Vancouver, Washington away from Portland.
[2:19:12.040 --> 2:19:18.040]  We need to make sure that we're prepared to protect our own communities and our neighborhoods, the suburbs,
[2:19:18.040 --> 2:19:20.040]  our cities that actually have law and order.
[2:19:20.040 --> 2:19:22.040]  We need to be ready to do that.
[2:19:22.040 --> 2:19:24.040]  That's key. We're not looking for vengeance.
[2:19:24.040 --> 2:19:28.040]  We're defensive. That's a key thing to say.
[2:19:28.040 --> 2:19:29.040]  Absolutely.
[2:19:29.040 --> 2:19:32.040]  We just want to make sure that he gets to jail too.
[2:19:32.040 --> 2:19:34.040]  Yeah. Nobody wants more bloodshed, man.
[2:19:34.040 --> 2:19:36.040]  We just want this to stop.
[2:19:36.040 --> 2:19:44.040]  We want this to stop, but it doesn't have to end with more bodies and more heartbroken mothers and brothers and business partners.
[2:19:44.040 --> 2:19:45.040]  Well, let's just be honest.
[2:19:45.040 --> 2:19:46.040]  I'm not being mean.
[2:19:46.040 --> 2:19:49.040]  These Antifa are the scum of the earth.
[2:19:49.040 --> 2:19:50.040]  I've been at the events.
[2:19:50.040 --> 2:19:51.040]  You've been there more than that.
[2:19:51.040 --> 2:19:55.040]  They literally are devil-worshipping, child molester, methhead, trash.
[2:19:55.040 --> 2:19:57.040]  So it's like stomping on dog manure.
[2:19:57.040 --> 2:20:00.040]  It doesn't do anything.
[2:20:00.040 --> 2:20:01.040]  It's a waste of your time.
[2:20:01.040 --> 2:20:04.040]  There's so many bigger things to do in this country right now.
[2:20:04.040 --> 2:20:07.040]  That's why, you know, we've got to focus on the government, the people.
[2:20:07.040 --> 2:20:09.040]  No, I agree. Look, guys, I've got a thousand questions.
[2:20:09.040 --> 2:20:11.040]  Alex Jones has got the biggest mouth around.
[2:20:11.040 --> 2:20:12.040]  I just, you guys were there.
[2:20:12.040 --> 2:20:13.040]  You almost got killed.
[2:20:13.040 --> 2:20:14.040]  Your buddy got killed.
[2:20:14.040 --> 2:20:17.040]  So I just want to get, you know, you have the perspective of what you want to say.
[2:20:17.040 --> 2:20:19.040]  But I've got to don't worry.
[2:20:19.040 --> 2:20:24.040]  I got a bunch of questions for Joey Gibson and Chandler Papas straight ahead with Aaron J.
[2:20:24.040 --> 2:20:33.040]  Danielson, aka J Bishop, as the media said, who was executed unarmed in cold blood and the media is still trying to cover up saying, oh, it's not political.
[2:20:33.040 --> 2:20:35.040]  When will they bust the guy that did it?
[2:20:35.040 --> 2:20:37.040]  Is the main suspect really the guy?
[2:20:37.040 --> 2:21:03.040]  We'll talk about it straight ahead.
[2:21:08.040 --> 2:21:15.040]  Now we sit here, warning people for decades, trying to get people ready, trying to stop what was coming.
[2:21:15.040 --> 2:21:17.040]  But you know what?
[2:21:17.040 --> 2:21:21.040]  Revelations and God's word says it's coming so you can't stop it.
[2:21:21.040 --> 2:21:25.040]  And it's in that understanding that we're part of God's larger plan than he.
[2:21:25.040 --> 2:21:34.040]  Come to the point in our own psyche, our own spirit, our own will that we submit to God and realize God's in charge of God as the power.
[2:21:34.040 --> 2:21:37.040]  And the devil is set as a tester.
[2:21:37.040 --> 2:21:39.040]  And now it's up to us to make the right decision.
[2:21:39.040 --> 2:22:05.040]  That's what it's really always been about.
[2:22:05.040 --> 2:22:13.040]  Plus, I go out just like with info and I bring you the very best items, the very best products that I personally use and I love.
[2:22:13.040 --> 2:22:23.040]  So go to infowarstore.com, check out the products, get some today, share them with friends, review them, and know that you cannot lose because you're funding the info war.
[2:22:23.040 --> 2:22:25.040]  Let's fight the globalists.
[2:22:25.040 --> 2:22:29.040]  Plus, these are great products, but I want to thank you for keeping me in the game.
[2:22:29.040 --> 2:22:31.040]  I want to thank you for funding our operation.
[2:22:31.040 --> 2:22:35.040]  So continue to spread the word and fund info wars at infowarstore.com.
[2:22:35.040 --> 2:22:40.040]  And I salute you once again, once again, once again, once again, once again.
[2:22:40.040 --> 2:22:42.040]  Attention, attention, attention.
[2:22:42.040 --> 2:22:45.040]  Do anyone that still wants to live in a free country.
[2:22:45.040 --> 2:22:55.040]  The New World Order, CHICOM Globalist Syndicate is making its move to implode the dollar and thrust the United States into a civil war by contesting the election.
[2:22:55.040 --> 2:22:59.040]  They are openly work ending this at the highest levels of Democratic Party.
[2:22:59.040 --> 2:23:03.040]  Nancy Pelosi and others have gone on television and said they will contest the election.
[2:23:03.040 --> 2:23:05.040]  Trump is going.
[2:23:05.040 --> 2:23:09.040]  They will hold a separate inauguration for Biden and Kamala Harris.
[2:23:09.040 --> 2:23:12.040]  And that anyone challenging that will be called a racist.
[2:23:12.040 --> 2:23:14.040]  They will then trigger race, riots, and violence.
[2:23:14.040 --> 2:23:17.040]  They've already beta tested around the country.
[2:23:17.040 --> 2:23:20.040]  We are not living in normal times.
[2:23:20.040 --> 2:23:27.040]  When these type of things happen in history, people are usually caught flat footed because they can't believe they're living in such a criminal era.
[2:23:27.040 --> 2:23:34.040]  We are. We are living in the period where this criminal globalist syndicate that's been feeding on America is being exposed and removed.
[2:23:34.040 --> 2:23:38.040]  Now is the time for all good men and women to come to their aid of the country.
[2:23:38.040 --> 2:23:58.040]  Spread the word now, Paul Reverez.
[2:24:08.040 --> 2:24:12.040]  I knew it was going to happen Sunday morning when I called Joey Gibson.
[2:24:12.040 --> 2:24:15.040]  And he said there was too much hurt, too many people he had to talk to.
[2:24:15.040 --> 2:24:18.040]  He couldn't talk until the family had made the statement.
[2:24:18.040 --> 2:24:21.040]  And I knew he'd be on Monday.
[2:24:21.040 --> 2:24:23.040]  I knew they'd come out and attack him and they'd have to speak out.
[2:24:23.040 --> 2:24:25.040]  But see, that's what real patriots are like.
[2:24:25.040 --> 2:24:26.040]  They weren't there for the attention.
[2:24:26.040 --> 2:24:29.040]  They weren't there to get on air when their buddy got killed.
[2:24:29.040 --> 2:24:31.040]  They were licking their wounds.
[2:24:31.040 --> 2:24:33.040]  They were trying to figure out what to do next.
[2:24:33.040 --> 2:24:41.040]  All the media was defaming them and lying about them and pissing all over Aaron J. Danielson's a.k.a. J. Bishop's memory.
[2:24:41.040 --> 2:24:45.040]  And now Joe Biden's been a new statement.
[2:24:45.040 --> 2:24:49.040]  He said pro-Trump protesters were spoiling for a fight.
[2:24:49.040 --> 2:24:52.040]  You don't fly your American flags and drive down a street.
[2:24:52.040 --> 2:24:54.040]  That city's a no-go zone.
[2:24:54.040 --> 2:25:00.040]  You stand down and you lick their boots, Chandler Papas.
[2:25:00.040 --> 2:25:02.040]  You and the Patriot group and Joey Gibson.
[2:25:02.040 --> 2:25:07.040]  You don't stand up and go pray in the public square when you get physically attacked.
[2:25:07.040 --> 2:25:09.040]  How dare you?
[2:25:09.040 --> 2:25:11.040]  It's your fault he got shot.
[2:25:11.040 --> 2:25:18.040]  What the hell do you make of that, Chandler Papas and Joey Gibson?
[2:25:18.040 --> 2:25:28.040]  The guy who shot my friend was arrested in July at Pierce for having a gun downtown at one of these other protests.
[2:25:28.040 --> 2:25:34.040]  They continue to let rioters out, guys who are throwing explosives at Homeland Security and police,
[2:25:34.040 --> 2:25:39.040]  these guys who are assaulting people, these guys who have done 30 plus million dollars in property damage,
[2:25:39.040 --> 2:25:47.040]  not to mention the lost revenue that have cost people their businesses on top of already being stressed from this COVID BS.
[2:25:47.040 --> 2:25:55.040]  These are the people that they want running the streets and they will do anything to make us look bad.
[2:25:55.040 --> 2:26:02.040]  They're doing anything they can to take away our agency.
[2:26:02.040 --> 2:26:15.040]  Man, it's hard for me to say having just lost a friend, thinking about the blood that it is going to cost.
[2:26:15.040 --> 2:26:21.040]  Let's talk about your buddy Aaron J. Danielson, number of the media is J Bishop.
[2:26:21.040 --> 2:26:25.040]  You guys are there that night. Go back to what happened. Why were you out of the trucks?
[2:26:25.040 --> 2:26:31.040]  What was going on? What were the minutes that led up to it? Describe that for us.
[2:26:31.040 --> 2:26:39.040]  We were heading back to the truck. I mean, we've gone down there any number of times with independent journalists and other guys that just,
[2:26:39.040 --> 2:26:46.040]  I mean, sometimes go down there to make a point that we can be there. Sometimes let's go down there and just record what's happening.
[2:26:46.040 --> 2:26:51.040]  And you've been down there any number of times because we have every right to be there. We're a tax-paying American citizen.
[2:26:51.040 --> 2:26:53.040]  We have every right to be down there.
[2:26:53.040 --> 2:26:57.040]  That's like telling black people they can't be out after night or black people can't go eat at a certain restaurant.
[2:26:57.040 --> 2:27:03.040]  That's what the left's doing. They're saying Christian conservatives don't have a right to be in a city.
[2:27:03.040 --> 2:27:08.040]  Right. And they want to leverage this whole Black Lives Matter thing.
[2:27:08.040 --> 2:27:12.040]  But I'll tell you, it was my friend who was stabbed down there about a month ago.
[2:27:12.040 --> 2:27:16.040]  So it has nothing to do with skin color. He's black. I'm on his microphone right now.
[2:27:16.040 --> 2:27:19.040]  This isn't about color. This was never about race.
[2:27:19.040 --> 2:27:26.040]  Brother, we know your Christians. We know the truth. We know. We know.
[2:27:26.040 --> 2:27:33.040]  This is sick. So where does it go? So describe that night. You're down there? Like suddenly what happens?
[2:27:33.040 --> 2:27:39.040]  We start hearing shouting and they start shouting at us. We've got a couple right here. We've got a couple right here.
[2:27:39.040 --> 2:27:44.040]  They isolated us. They saw two of us alone. Two of us wasn't a big enough crowd.
[2:27:44.040 --> 2:27:52.040]  They saw two of us alone. We turned around and it didn't even occur to me that this guy had a gun pointed on me.
[2:27:52.040 --> 2:27:57.040]  It caught my eye. This guy was wearing white because everybody down there is in black block.
[2:27:57.040 --> 2:28:00.040]  Here's this guy wearing white. Okay. And then two shots ring out of me.
[2:28:00.040 --> 2:28:04.040]  You think, man, did that really just happen? Did somebody just shoot at me?
[2:28:04.040 --> 2:28:15.040]  Okay. I don't have any holes in me. I turn over and they killed him for nothing, man, for absolutely nothing.
[2:28:15.040 --> 2:28:22.040]  Well, we've seen the photos of the man in white with the Birkenstocks following the vehicles and who appears to be the same person there with the same tattoo.
[2:28:22.040 --> 2:28:27.040]  We're not saying he's the killer, but the police are now saying he is a suspect. What is the latest?
[2:28:27.040 --> 2:28:36.040]  Is the person you've seen those photos, does that match the description of who shot your friend?
[2:28:36.040 --> 2:28:48.040]  Yeah, mostly to the same degree. I didn't process all of that. I don't have a good memory of it because there was just so much, I mean, honestly, a shock.
[2:28:48.040 --> 2:28:49.040]  It was a blur.
[2:28:49.040 --> 2:28:56.040]  I didn't think I needed to remember what this guy looked like. I don't know. I should have.
[2:28:56.040 --> 2:29:00.040]  You're going to a parking garage and bam, bam, your buddy's dead, don't you?
[2:29:00.040 --> 2:29:08.040]  Basically, yeah, basically. And actually, the guy that caught that second, that footage you just played, you know, I know that guy personally.
[2:29:08.040 --> 2:29:15.040]  And it was just pure coincidence that he was out there that night. He said it blew him away. You know, the gunshots, totally surprising.
[2:29:15.040 --> 2:29:21.040]  He was done filming for the night. That's why that video starts with him, with the camera kind of swinging down.
[2:29:21.040 --> 2:29:29.040]  And then he heard the shots go off and saw that it was us. He totally threw him through a loop. He was at my house for like three hours last night.
[2:29:29.040 --> 2:29:34.040]  Let me say something really important here. Joey, you jump in. And I appreciate both of you guys know it's hard for you to talk about.
[2:29:34.040 --> 2:29:40.040]  I can see it in your eyes. It upsets me because we've been at rallies many times together. I mean, this is like, this is any of us.
[2:29:40.040 --> 2:29:45.040]  This is an attack on all of us. This makes me physically sick and also makes me very, very angry and want justice.
[2:29:45.040 --> 2:29:54.040]  The Portland police, we know on average aren't bad people. The leadership is bad under the mayor. They already arrested this guy reportedly wants the main suspect with a gun out for illegally.
[2:29:54.040 --> 2:30:01.040]  Why if this is the guy, this is people believe we're saying this is the main suspect that is saying, why don't we have him yet?
[2:30:01.040 --> 2:30:05.040]  And do you think they're going to try to cover this up?
[2:30:05.040 --> 2:30:13.040]  Yeah, I think personally, I think that Portland police, I believe will do everything they can to get them. That's just an assumption.
[2:30:13.040 --> 2:30:20.040]  I think that the FBI is on it too. Now, what's going to happen after, if they actually arrest them, what's going to happen after that?
[2:30:20.040 --> 2:30:25.040]  But you know, they're going to give them a slap on the wrist with this new DA. It's hard to tell.
[2:30:25.040 --> 2:30:31.040]  They put Soros DA's in in Austin now. They're in in St. Louis. They're in Portland. They're in everywhere.
[2:30:31.040 --> 2:30:36.040]  Literally, national security arrests. Soros DA's are in almost every city.
[2:30:36.040 --> 2:30:51.040]  Yeah, this new DA dominated in the elections too. I mean, he won by landslide the first time he ever ran. And so then he comes in and instantly says he's going to drop charges on 400 antifa BLM types who have felony riot charges and other charges.
[2:30:51.040 --> 2:31:00.040]  So it'll be interesting to see what happens. But I believe that it's important that we continue to put pressure on the city until this guy gets arrested so they don't sweep it under the rug.
[2:31:00.040 --> 2:31:08.040]  I think that's the most important thing. Also, if we get him arrested, it's going to lower the chances of anyone doing anything stupid in the future.
[2:31:08.040 --> 2:31:19.040]  The last thing that we want right now is someone wearing, of which, you know, maybe they'll do a false flag, but the last thing we want is someone wearing a MAGA hat going down in Portland with their gun and just shooting people.
[2:31:19.040 --> 2:31:29.040]  And I actually want to say this right here right now. If something does happen in Portland, I wouldn't be surprised if it's some sort of false flag to get this civil war going.
[2:31:29.040 --> 2:31:37.040]  That was my next question. In fact, this morning when I knew you could come on because you were over it, not over the grieving, but able to talk down. I get it.
[2:31:37.040 --> 2:31:47.040]  I was going to ask you false flag. This is the season of the false flag. I mean, they're going to try to stage something now because their whole rioting, their whole kill, their death squad has blown up in their face.
[2:31:47.040 --> 2:31:51.040]  Now they're trying to say Trump's behind all this. What are they going to do next, Joey?
[2:31:51.040 --> 2:31:59.040]  This is what I've been thinking about and I'm seeing everything that's going on and you see them blaming Trump already. You know, a conservative Christian gets murdered and they're blaming Trump.
[2:31:59.040 --> 2:32:07.040]  So how much would they love it if someone came out and just started shooting a bunch of antifa and Black Lives Matters? I mean, they're expendable to them anyways.
[2:32:07.040 --> 2:32:16.040]  And so I think we have to be very cautious in the things that we do and we can't be reckless in terms of bringing large groups into Portland.
[2:32:16.040 --> 2:32:25.040]  Here's what I want to say. It's unfortunate that Jay had to lose his life and it's unfortunate that other people got hurt such as Adam who got kicked in the head.
[2:32:25.040 --> 2:32:33.040]  But antifa and Black Lives Matters burning down Portland is probably a good thing for to wake up the left.
[2:32:33.040 --> 2:32:37.040]  There's a lot of people in Portland that are sick and tired of antifa and Black Lives Matters.
[2:32:37.040 --> 2:32:46.040]  There's a lot of protesters that I've seen personally that are sick and tired who actually believe in the cause of Black Lives Matters, who are sick and tired of these people.
[2:32:46.040 --> 2:32:55.040]  When I walked up to Jay's body, I didn't know it was his body. This whole mob just surrounded Albina, Troy and myself.
[2:32:55.040 --> 2:33:00.040]  And as we're walking down there, they're assaulting us, peppers spraying it. There's people in that crowd.
[2:33:00.040 --> 2:33:09.040]  It's like most of them are zombies yelling and screaming, but then there's people who are actually alive, who actually have a heart in that crowd that put themselves in harm's way to protect us.
[2:33:09.040 --> 2:33:19.040]  So I'm just going to ask you, if you're liberal or a lefty or whatever you think you are politically and you're a good person and you're lining yourself with these people, you got to do something about this.
[2:33:19.040 --> 2:33:28.040]  You need to call this out. It's not okay what they did and it's not okay to dehumanize someone like Jay simply so that you guys can feel better about this violence.
[2:33:28.040 --> 2:33:33.040]  That's right. We got to go to break final segment with both of you gentlemen. We'll come back and talk more about this historic event.
[2:33:33.040 --> 2:33:39.040]  But I agree with you. I think it's time to stand down and not go into their cities until the election ends. We'll be right back.
[2:33:39.040 --> 2:33:48.040]  I've talked to the EMS and I've talked to medical doctors and what makes you nauseated is not just the smell of piss, but we call the smell of bum piss that has that sweet nauseating smell.
[2:33:48.040 --> 2:33:55.040]  I wouldn't say sweet. Well, it does. It's a sweet stance. It makes me want to throw up like Rodney. It is the crap of dust mites.
[2:33:55.040 --> 2:33:59.040]  Have you noticed the stench of bum piss in your leftist run neighborhoods?
[2:33:59.040 --> 2:34:06.040]  The crap of dust mites in bum piss is a real thing and InfoWars Store has the solution.
[2:34:06.040 --> 2:34:19.040]  InfoWars has created the most powerful herbal lung cleanse and respiratory support product on the market with over a thousand types of mold and mildew, toxic chemicals and yes, dust mites.

[2:34:33.040 --> 2:34:39.040]  Order the InfoWars life lung cleanse plus supplement today at infowarstore.com.
[2:34:39.040 --> 2:34:49.040]  Going back more than 20 years ago, I coined the term the false left-right paradigm from reading the books by Carol Quigley speaking to Brzezinski and others,
[2:34:49.040 --> 2:35:01.040]  how they described powerful institutions and foundations, successful takeover of the left parties and right parties in Europe and the United States.
[2:35:01.040 --> 2:35:13.040]  It didn't mean those parties didn't have differences before. They were able to get control of the leadership of both and manipulate the public with the illusion of change and the illusion of a fight going on like WWF wrestling or something.
[2:35:13.040 --> 2:35:20.040]  With Trump and with our populist movement taking over the Republicans, this is a real populist movement. Doesn't mean it's perfect.
[2:35:20.040 --> 2:35:28.040]  And you know it's real because the Democrats, the power structure, the chai comms and the entire old Republican leadership have all endorsed Joe Biden.
[2:35:28.040 --> 2:35:38.040]  That's why I'm supporting Trump. It's about Americanism, not globalism. It's about ending the one-sided trade deals for defending our borders, for defending the right to Second Amendment and pro-life.
[2:35:38.040 --> 2:35:40.040]  And Trump's doing all of that.
[2:35:40.040 --> 2:35:49.040]  The New World Order is a planetary corporate plan for world government. But world government is only the control grid.
[2:35:49.040 --> 2:36:03.040]  Now, inner members of the cult are told that they are going to transcend and become gods and attain immortality. But the price for that is to carry out the orderly extermination of all carbon-based line forms.
[2:36:03.040 --> 2:36:11.040]  That's why they say carbon is bad. They are rewriting the entire genetic code of the planet. They are playing God.
[2:36:11.040 --> 2:36:21.040]  They believe they have been inspired by interdimensional entities that are giving them advanced technology to carry out this transformation.
[2:36:21.040 --> 2:36:33.040]  I know this sounds insane, but if you read the writings of the globalist, it's all on record. You have been warned. You have been given the information to say no to this plan.
[2:36:33.040 --> 2:36:40.040]  This is the end of all life on Earth as we know it. This is the alien takeover of Earth.
[2:36:40.040 --> 2:36:45.040]  We launched the Everyday Essential Special a week ago. It ends on Monday.
[2:36:45.040 --> 2:36:49.040]  That means you've got four days to take advantage of it while I'm cutting this end.
[2:36:49.040 --> 2:37:13.040]  You've got three days to take advantage of it.
[2:37:13.040 --> 2:37:40.040]  Thank you for watching.
[2:37:43.040 --> 2:37:50.040]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[2:38:13.040 --> 2:38:16.040]  The media is trying to cover it with some bloke assassination right now.
[2:38:16.040 --> 2:38:22.040]  Biden's busy saying pro-Trump supporters were spoiling for a fight in Portland.
[2:38:22.040 --> 2:38:31.040]  And here's another thing he had to say with Anderson Cooper last night. Here's Joe Biden blaming President Trump for the Democrats' creation, Antifa.
[2:38:31.040 --> 2:38:35.040]  Joining me now, former Vice President Joe Biden. Mr. Vice President, thanks for being with us.
[2:38:35.040 --> 2:38:41.040]  Conservatives have been attacking you for taking three days to denounce violence erupting in these protests.
[2:38:41.040 --> 2:38:43.040]  What do you say to that?
[2:38:43.040 --> 2:38:47.040]  Well, first of all, I denounced it a long time ago. I denounced it weeks ago.
[2:38:47.040 --> 2:38:54.040]  And I've made it clear from the beginning that there is no justification whatsoever for violence looting.
[2:38:54.040 --> 2:39:03.040]  Matter of fact, it just flies in the face of the protesters going on and takes away from the whole rationale for what's happening here.
[2:39:03.040 --> 2:39:08.040]  So I've condemned the violence in the very beginning. They're just flat wrong as usual.
[2:39:08.040 --> 2:39:17.040]  The Vice President echoed the President last night by telling Americans that they would not be safe in Joe Biden's America.
[2:39:17.040 --> 2:39:25.040]  Well, you know, look, if you think about it, Donald Trump saying, you're not going to be safe in Joe Biden's America,
[2:39:25.040 --> 2:39:29.040]  all the video being played is being played in Donald Trump's America.
[2:39:29.040 --> 2:39:35.040]  You know, Kellyanne Conway came out and was very, very blunt about it today. I think I have a quote here.
[2:39:35.040 --> 2:39:44.040]  She said, the more chaos and anarchy and vandalism, the more violence equals a better, better the choice for a very,
[2:39:44.040 --> 2:39:50.040]  excuse me, better for a very clear choice. These guys are rooting for violence. That's what it's all about.
[2:39:50.040 --> 2:39:56.040]  To prove that you should be scared of Joe Biden, they're pointing to what's happening in Donald Trump's America.
[2:39:56.040 --> 2:39:59.040]  He can't even talk.
[2:39:59.040 --> 2:40:06.040]  Chandler Pompous, Joey Gibson, other points you want to make up, your friend was murdered and the meeting is still trying to cover up.
[2:40:06.040 --> 2:40:10.040]  It was a political assassination. Best comeback.
[2:40:10.040 --> 2:40:15.040]  Yeah, no, there's video and photographs of this guy walking around all night, putting his hand on his gun.
[2:40:15.040 --> 2:40:19.040]  He was looking for a reason to use it. I've been carrying a gun for almost 10 years.
[2:40:19.040 --> 2:40:23.040]  Most places I go and never take it downtown, never take it to these rallies and let's like a two way event.
[2:40:23.040 --> 2:40:30.040]  We know there's not going to be opposition. I've never put my hand on my gun until I thought my life was in danger.
[2:40:30.040 --> 2:40:36.040]  And I've never pulled it out and pointed it at somebody ever. And I've never killed anybody.
[2:40:36.040 --> 2:40:42.040]  This guy was looking for a reason to use it. This guy came down there to harass.
[2:40:42.040 --> 2:40:49.040]  And this Joe Biden trying to turn everything around on Trump, this isn't the Trump's America that would be.
[2:40:49.040 --> 2:40:59.040]  If Democratic bears and politicians like Tate Brown, the governors, Jay Inslee and Gavin Newsom and these pieces of crap would do their jobs.
[2:40:59.040 --> 2:41:04.040]  Well, that's it exactly. It's their blue cities. It's their blue states that are doing this.
[2:41:04.040 --> 2:41:08.040]  The idea that it's our fault or Trump's fault. Joey Gibson, I don't see this working.
[2:41:08.040 --> 2:41:11.040]  Why did they think Antifa and riots and intimidation would work?
[2:41:11.040 --> 2:41:15.040]  Because the real polls show it's backfire. What do you make of that?
[2:41:15.040 --> 2:41:20.040]  Yeah, I don't know. I think about that all the time, obviously, because I used to go in these cities.
[2:41:20.040 --> 2:41:24.040]  But I see a lot of people turning away from the Democratic Party.
[2:41:24.040 --> 2:41:31.040]  I see a lot of liberals in Portland that I've talked to personally that have no idea what to do with their city.
[2:41:31.040 --> 2:41:35.040]  Because right now they have an election for Mary's book.
[2:41:35.040 --> 2:41:40.040]  We have Ted Wheeler, who's probably the worst mayor that I've ever seen in my entire life and pathological liar.
[2:41:40.040 --> 2:41:46.040]  And then you have Sarah, who is literally a commonance.
[2:41:46.040 --> 2:41:53.040]  They're probably going to vote for Ted Wheeler just because they don't want to go further left than they already have.
[2:41:53.040 --> 2:41:57.040]  But I will say this, it is a blessing in disguise.
[2:41:57.040 --> 2:42:01.040]  Like I said, I don't want to see people get hurt, but people are sick and tired of this all over the country.
[2:42:01.040 --> 2:42:05.040]  And I see the Democrats are pivoting. As you see, Biden's pivoting.
[2:42:05.040 --> 2:42:10.040]  Now they're going to blame all this stuff on Trump saying that this is Trump's American stuff.
[2:42:10.040 --> 2:42:14.040]  But I went down to a Black Lives Matter protest in Camus, Washington.
[2:42:14.040 --> 2:42:16.040]  They were all high schoolers.
[2:42:16.040 --> 2:42:19.040]  And one of the things I kept saying is like, this is because of Trump.
[2:42:19.040 --> 2:42:24.040]  These black men are dying in the streets because of Trump, which obviously, you know, was only about 12 per year.
[2:42:24.040 --> 2:42:27.040]  But the same thing was happening when Obama was in office.
[2:42:27.040 --> 2:42:31.040]  And I explained to him, all of these people who are shot, okay?
[2:42:31.040 --> 2:42:39.040]  And cold, you know, these high profile ones are in far left cities with a Democrat mayor, the Democrat police chief.
[2:42:39.040 --> 2:42:42.040]  Mostly police chiefs are even black, like even in Portland, Oregon.
[2:42:42.040 --> 2:42:48.040]  And so I hope that if you're a liberal, you look at this, look at these policies and what they do.
[2:42:48.040 --> 2:42:55.040]  If we roll back policies, roll back taxes and regulations in this country, and let's just free this country, get this government out of the way.
[2:42:55.040 --> 2:42:59.040]  And hopefully we get Trump in there in 2020.
[2:42:59.040 --> 2:43:08.040]  That's my next question. What happens if Trump loses through fraud or whatever? What will they do next?
[2:43:08.040 --> 2:43:13.040]  I personally have no idea. Go ahead, Janet.
[2:43:13.040 --> 2:43:25.040]  I just, I don't know if I have a good answer for that. Historically, historically, it doesn't turn out well.
[2:43:25.040 --> 2:43:36.040]  All I know is, Kyle Rittenhouse got chased down with people with guns pointed at him, and he's in jail.
[2:43:36.040 --> 2:43:47.040]  But then when the anti-fraud tax people, they're heroes, and I just don't see how the establishment thinks they're going to be insulated from what comes next.
[2:43:47.040 --> 2:43:52.040]  I'm also worried about... Go ahead.
[2:43:52.040 --> 2:43:58.040]  I'm really worried about people are starting to be scared to be able to defend themselves. This is what they're doing.
[2:43:58.040 --> 2:44:06.040]  Like if you take Kyle, for example, and trying to charge him with murder, what they're doing is they're passing gun control without going through legislation, right?
[2:44:06.040 --> 2:44:12.040]  They're making it so that patriots or anybody should be scared, or if you're a patriot, to be scared to use your gun.
[2:44:12.040 --> 2:44:13.040]  So it's self-imposed gun control.
[2:44:13.040 --> 2:44:21.040]  That's it. They have Soros controlled, literally thousands of them, DAs and people, and they're saying, we don't care if someone's raping or why for you.
[2:44:21.040 --> 2:44:25.040]  You can't defend... Exactly. They're trying to ban self-defense right now.
[2:44:25.040 --> 2:44:32.040]  So what do we do about Soros? I mean, we just can't keep putting up with him and Alexander Soros.
[2:44:32.040 --> 2:44:36.040]  One thing I was thinking is, why is it that we can't declare war on China?
[2:44:36.040 --> 2:44:40.040]  Not that we're going to go over there. Why can't we declare war on China?
[2:44:40.040 --> 2:44:45.040]  And then we go after everybody that's financed by China. We can go after big universities.
[2:44:45.040 --> 2:44:49.040]  Because China declared war on us. Here's the deal. I don't want to go to the Middle East and attack the Muslims.
[2:44:49.040 --> 2:44:54.040]  They declare war on us. I don't want to go to war with China. The left declared war on us.
[2:44:54.040 --> 2:45:03.040]  I'm not looking for war to stop attacking me. And if they're already attacking us and we're schmucks and never admit it, well, then we're idiots.
[2:45:03.040 --> 2:45:07.040]  Absolutely. I agree with that 100%. We've got to go after the money.
[2:45:07.040 --> 2:45:13.040]  We have a lawyer in Portland who bills out every single one of these Antifa members.
[2:45:13.040 --> 2:45:20.040]  He sues all of the patriots. I want to know, and Antifa's not paying him a cent. Someone's paying him money.
[2:45:20.040 --> 2:45:27.040]  So if all of these people colluding and working together to cause these problems, and they run around free, just free.
[2:45:27.040 --> 2:45:30.040]  And then he laughs at us because we're so nice. Well, it's like Tiger Carlson said,
[2:45:30.040 --> 2:45:41.040]  Rand Paul is like, I want to know who's funding him. We gave the Senate the dot. We got Alexander Soros' documents. We know they're funding him.
[2:45:41.040 --> 2:45:49.040]  And I just wonder if Trump is so confident in his inner polls that he doesn't want to shake things up too much until after the election.
[2:45:49.040 --> 2:45:54.040]  Because I know that Trump is aware of what's happening. I know he understands what's going on.
[2:45:54.040 --> 2:45:56.040]  Believe me, he's aware.
[2:45:56.040 --> 2:46:06.040]  Yeah. So, you know, everyone's waiting. We want these criminals to go to jail because I really, I don't have hatred for these Antifa punks.
[2:46:06.040 --> 2:46:11.040]  I don't. I feel bad for them. They're being played. They're being used. I want these people at the top to go to jail.
[2:46:11.040 --> 2:46:16.040]  I want our country back. I want peace in this country. I want us to be able to exist.
[2:46:16.040 --> 2:46:22.040]  Well, that's it. You know, there are a bunch of betas trying to act like they're powerful because a real alpha wouldn't run around acting like this.
[2:46:22.040 --> 2:46:28.040]  They need to be slapped down, letting every method, every devil works for loose. That's our fault.
[2:46:28.040 --> 2:46:32.040]  And you guys go out and confront it. Your buddy just got killed. So America needs to back you guys.
[2:46:32.040 --> 2:46:42.040]  How do we support Patriot prayer? How do we support Chandler? Publish your friend Aaron J. Danielson, AKA J Bishop that was murdered by the scum.
[2:46:42.040 --> 2:46:49.040]  If you go to PatriotPrayerUSA.com, the GoFundMe will be on there. There's, there's, there's ways to sign up your cell phone.
[2:46:49.040 --> 2:46:55.040]  If you ever want to be part of any of these, these events, you can sign up your cell phone. We're trying to get outside of social media.
[2:46:55.040 --> 2:46:58.040]  And so that's probably the best way.
[2:46:58.040 --> 2:47:04.040]  Exactly. You got to go to the original websites, like Patriot prayer, like info wars. That's what it's all about.
[2:47:04.040 --> 2:47:11.040]  Gentlemen, join me again in the next few days as we learn about who's going to get arrested. Maybe they'll make him to give him the key to the city, the guy that did it.
[2:47:11.040 --> 2:47:17.040]  They're in Portland, but we're going to lay this out. Let me know how the family of Aaron J. Danielson's doing.
[2:47:17.040 --> 2:47:20.040]  And please give us an update. Okay, gentlemen.
[2:47:20.040 --> 2:47:21.040]  Thank you.
[2:47:21.040 --> 2:47:22.040]  Thank you.
[2:47:22.040 --> 2:47:28.040]  Danielson, you want to add that channeler?
[2:47:28.040 --> 2:47:31.040]  Yeah, we can't let them make us afraid.
[2:47:31.040 --> 2:47:37.040]  I think it's critical. We remember whatever they're doing, we cannot back down. We cannot be made afraid.
[2:47:37.040 --> 2:47:40.040]  We cannot let them take our agency from us through fear.
[2:47:40.040 --> 2:47:44.040]  We absolutely can't do it. I'm not going to stop going into Portland.
[2:47:44.040 --> 2:47:53.040]  I'm not going to avoid going into Clackamas. I'm not going to stop living my life because of what they're doing because of their wickedness.
[2:47:53.040 --> 2:47:54.040]  It's not going to happen.
[2:47:54.040 --> 2:48:00.040]  By the way, I'm not agreeing with you. I'm just saying they're trying to get a false flag is now the time to not invade their areas.
[2:48:00.040 --> 2:48:05.040]  But I guess you're right. What's the point of Aaron's death if we don't continue?
[2:48:05.040 --> 2:48:09.040]  He wouldn't want us to back down now.
[2:48:09.040 --> 2:48:14.040]  We got to do five more minutes than stay there. I got to both of you. Then what do we do? Because I'm ready to march out right now.
[2:48:14.040 --> 2:48:18.040]  I'm ready to come join you in Portland. Watching that doesn't scare me. It makes me want to come there.
[2:48:18.040 --> 2:48:25.040]  The problem is, is that what do we do once they attack? Because I mean, these people, I know we're not scared of them.
[2:48:25.040 --> 2:48:28.040]  We're scared of what we're about to do to them.
[2:48:30.040 --> 2:48:37.040]  It was a sleeper product. It wasn't popular at first, but as people tried it, it's become one of our top five best sellers.
[2:48:37.040 --> 2:48:45.040]  I'm talking about the eight pack power stack, 13 different pills filled with super nutrients, vitamins, minerals, and more.
[2:48:45.040 --> 2:48:51.040]  You take this morning and one pack and at night, it's available right now at 60% off for a limited time.
[2:48:51.040 --> 2:48:58.040]  You get it with Survival Shield X2 that's now back in stock. This has changed my life and so many other people's lives.
[2:48:58.040 --> 2:49:07.040]  Now here's the problem. Some of the patented ingredients that are in eight pack power stack because of the shutdown and the lockdown are not available for us to even reorder it.
[2:49:07.040 --> 2:49:12.040]  So this could be the last shipment that we ever have. It's in stock now.

[2:49:43.040 --> 2:49:55.040]  Well, we set out a few years ago to go out and develop with top manufacturers the strongest, highest quality, purest fish oil out there and this blend is amazing.

[2:50:48.040 --> 2:51:16.040]  All right, I have a special film I'm going to air that's very powerful the next hour. I wanted to finish up with the founder of the Patriot Pair Group, Joey Gibson and a good personal friend of the man that was executed, a.k.a. J. Bishop Aaron J. Danielson.
[2:51:16.040 --> 2:51:19.040]  Can we pop us here with us?
[2:51:19.040 --> 2:51:22.040]  Trump is saying he's going to Kenosha tomorrow.
[2:51:22.040 --> 2:51:26.040]  He's saying there'd be great death and destruction, great death and injury if he didn't go.
[2:51:26.040 --> 2:51:29.040]  The National Guard was and said, I think that's good.
[2:51:29.040 --> 2:51:34.040]  And I'm all about not having a big flare up, but they're going to try to stage a false flag.
[2:51:34.040 --> 2:51:42.040]  So I agree, we should not go into these cities, because the left is denying us, saying black folks that was at the back of the bus, this is kind of the modern version.
[2:51:42.040 --> 2:51:57.040]  But at the same time, wise as a serpent, peaceful as a dove, for you, Chandler, and then you, Joey, then your basic understanding of what we should do then.
[2:51:57.040 --> 2:52:03.040]  Like I said, I'm not ready to back down from this. I'm not willing to back down from this.
[2:52:03.040 --> 2:52:06.040]  My friend just gave his life for this.
[2:52:06.040 --> 2:52:12.040]  I would be doing him a disservice. I would be doing his life and his legacy of disservice by giving up.
[2:52:12.040 --> 2:52:17.040]  The day after he passed, not even a full 24 hours, we went out to Sandy and did another flag wave.
[2:52:17.040 --> 2:52:21.040]  And I think I picked up a microphone for the second time in my life.
[2:52:21.040 --> 2:52:24.040]  We can't, if we give up, they will win.
[2:52:24.040 --> 2:52:30.040]  The more we give up ground, the problem with defense and a defensive position is the more we give up ground, the more they'll take.
[2:52:30.040 --> 2:52:37.040]  They will continue to push. People are leaving Portland and California and Washington in droves.
[2:52:37.040 --> 2:52:42.040]  My father's trying to buy a piece of property in Idaho and he can't get a listing because they're going so quick.
[2:52:42.040 --> 2:52:46.040]  Anything he's interested in goes because people are leaving.
[2:52:46.040 --> 2:52:52.040]  That was my next point. Is there is a giant exodus out of that area?
[2:52:52.040 --> 2:52:55.040]  Yeah, that's exactly it.
[2:52:55.040 --> 2:53:02.040]  Everybody with two brain cells to rub together that has money and resources is thinking,
[2:53:02.040 --> 2:53:07.040]  wow, I probably don't want to be here while they're killing conservatives.
[2:53:07.040 --> 2:53:09.040]  Because why would they be?
[2:53:09.040 --> 2:53:16.040]  So it's a giant leftist temper tantrum. Joey Gibson, what do you think we do in the last 63 days of the election?
[2:53:16.040 --> 2:53:20.040]  Do we press going into these areas or what do we do?
[2:53:20.040 --> 2:53:28.040]  Well, I respect anyone's right to go into Portland to do the thing. I know someone's scheduling a rally down there soon.
[2:53:28.040 --> 2:53:37.040]  I think that for me, this may sound bad, but I kind of want them to burn down their city.
[2:53:37.040 --> 2:53:42.040]  I want them to burn it down and I don't want them to be able to blame anybody but themselves.
[2:53:42.040 --> 2:53:48.040]  They've been pushing for these politics for a long time. Now they're going to get what they want.
[2:53:48.040 --> 2:53:52.040]  I believe that we should never stand down. We should never back down.
[2:53:52.040 --> 2:53:57.040]  I'm going to be doing all kinds of stuff in the next two months, especially leading up to this election.
[2:53:57.040 --> 2:54:06.040]  But I'm going to do everything I can to be very strategic and my plans will not be announced for the public to see so that they can prepare.
[2:54:06.040 --> 2:54:09.040]  Exactly. You don't want to get caught up in the middle of a false flag.
[2:54:09.040 --> 2:54:17.040]  Right, absolutely. And the thing is too is that the way that Antifa works, Antifa or a bunch of cowards, their strength comes from the mob.
[2:54:17.040 --> 2:54:25.040]  That's it. So if we're able to go into these areas unannounced, they have no strength because they want to be able to plan.
[2:54:25.040 --> 2:54:28.040]  They want to be able to throw rocks and bricks from far away.
[2:54:28.040 --> 2:54:36.040]  And so I think it's very important that patriots begin to be more strategic in the things that they do, especially in these far left cities.
[2:54:36.040 --> 2:54:43.040]  And do not be afraid. I don't do this because it's my job to be a face, but don't be afraid to cover up your identity.
[2:54:43.040 --> 2:54:48.040]  Don't be afraid to go in there and to do things that you have to do in order to protect yourself and your family.
[2:54:48.040 --> 2:54:55.040]  Now, this is war. There's no doubt. And never forget, pray to God for guidance that God lead by and direct us.
[2:54:55.040 --> 2:55:03.040]  Chandler Papas, we really appreciate you. We're so sorry for your friend, a.k.a. J. Bishop Aaron J. Danielson.
[2:55:03.040 --> 2:55:09.040]  We love him. We appreciate him. We'll put back on screen to go fund me. It's only got up a few thousand dollars the hour you're on.
[2:55:09.040 --> 2:55:14.040]  Aaron Danielson, official GoFundMe page. Folks, you'll donate there with the family and Joey Gibson. We salute you.
[2:55:14.040 --> 2:55:22.040]  We appreciate you for all you've done. And with your Patriot prayer group, you've really been that thin line of pro-American standing up.
[2:55:22.040 --> 2:55:24.040]  And we really appreciate you, my friend.
[2:55:27.040 --> 2:55:30.040]  Remember, it's all about Aaron J. Danielson, a martyr for freedom.
[2:55:30.040 --> 2:55:40.040]  We'll be right back on the other side with something very important. Stay with us.
[2:56:00.040 --> 2:56:06.040]  What I want to warn people about is coming true because it was all in the Rockefeller Foundation documents like Lockstep.
[2:56:06.040 --> 2:56:09.040]  This is the corporate planetary takeover.
[2:56:09.040 --> 2:56:15.040]  So, yes, I stand by what I said 10 years ago, what I said a year ago, and what I said last week more than ever.

[2:56:43.040 --> 2:56:49.040]  Live from Austin, Texas. Broadcasting worldwide. It's Alex Jones.
[2:56:49.040 --> 2:56:59.040]  Alright, we're into the fourth hour right now. I'm your host, Alex Jones, and I was sent a video this morning.
[2:56:59.040 --> 2:57:05.040]  One of the crew members called the Great Reset Davos of the Plot to Cancel Trump.
[2:57:05.040 --> 2:57:15.040]  And all of this is on record, but it's just good to see a film this good broken down by the folks that produced it.
[2:57:15.040 --> 2:57:22.040]  And that's Michael J. Matt, remnantnewspaper.com.
[2:57:22.040 --> 2:57:30.040]  And that's what's so exciting is to see all these great leaders who've been out there a long time but now getting the full picture and really exposing it.
[2:57:30.040 --> 2:57:40.040]  So we're going to air the Great Reset and I'm going to post it at infowarstore.com and newswarstore.com as we're speaking.
[2:57:40.040 --> 2:57:45.040]  But first, getting into the perfect storm, this was set at Davos this year.
[2:57:45.040 --> 2:57:55.040]  This is what they're planning. It's what they're using COVID for as a financial mechanism to collapse things to get you into debt but not make you think it was the globalists that did it.
[2:57:55.040 --> 2:58:05.040]  So we should air the perfect storm for a global currency reset from infowarstore.com for a March 15th.
[2:58:05.040 --> 2:58:12.040]  Then we will air the next piece, War with International Making Cartel or Nasera.
[2:58:12.040 --> 2:58:15.040]  We're going to air these two pieces in this segment.
[2:58:15.040 --> 2:58:24.040]  Then I'm going to come back and I'm going to air here for our audience, premiere for our audience, the Great Reset that does a fabulous job laying this out.
[2:58:24.040 --> 2:58:40.040]  Here we are getting into the Great Reset in March.
[2:58:40.040 --> 2:58:50.040]  The unit of account based on a fixed quantity of gold was officially adopted and the World Reserve currency became the British pound sterling.
[2:58:50.040 --> 2:59:00.040]  In 1914, after World War I, nations attempted to revive the gold standard but it collapsed during the Great Depression.
[2:59:00.040 --> 2:59:07.040]  Also in 1914, the Federal Reserve Bank, a private company, was born.
[2:59:07.040 --> 2:59:16.040]  After Britain was devastated by World War II, they were no longer a superpower and so the global reserve currency needed to be reset.
[2:59:16.040 --> 2:59:24.040]  In 1944, at the Bretton Woods Conference, the US dollar became the new global reserve currency.
[2:59:24.040 --> 2:59:32.040]  This established America as the dominant power in the world economy, giving America the sole ability to print dollars.
[2:59:32.040 --> 2:59:42.040]  The rest of the world would need to trade their own currency against the US dollar in order to balance exchange rates, keeping the international economy vibrant and fluid.
[2:59:42.040 --> 2:59:49.040]  But by the 1960s, the United States had printed more USD than their gold reserves could cover.
[2:59:49.040 --> 2:59:56.040]  And by 1970, a growing American trade deficit was undermining the value of the dollar.
[2:59:56.040 --> 3:00:03.040]  On August 15, 1971, President Richard Nixon brought an end to the gold standard.
[3:00:03.040 --> 3:00:11.040]  Federal Reserve notes of fiat currency backed by debt rather than gold became the new standard.
[3:00:11.040 --> 3:00:15.040]  This is basically no different than an IOU.
[3:00:15.040 --> 3:00:25.040]  As one would expect, right after President Nixon gave his speech, inflation began to rise and America's biggest export became debt.
[3:00:25.040 --> 3:00:35.040]  The creation of the petrodollar gave the US even more sway over world economies and today the international debt has become untenable.
[3:00:35.040 --> 3:00:40.040]  And many are saying another global currency reset is needed.
[3:00:40.040 --> 3:00:49.040]  Historically, the gold standard has been the most stable economy we have known, but gold can be manipulated and disruptive as well.
[3:00:49.040 --> 3:00:54.040]  Some are suggesting that cryptocurrency could be the solution.
[3:00:54.040 --> 3:00:59.040]  Crypto is run by an algorithm and can be designed to meet specific needs.
[3:00:59.040 --> 3:01:07.040]  The global currency needs to have fluid supply and the limited gold supply failed to keep up with economic growth.
[3:01:07.040 --> 3:01:14.040]  A sovereign free algorithm based alternative could potentially be more stable.
[3:01:14.040 --> 3:01:23.040]  China is almost ready to launch their own cryptocurrency, DCEP, short for digital currency electronic payments.
[3:01:23.040 --> 3:01:27.040]  DCEP is government controlled and fully centralized.
[3:01:27.040 --> 3:01:32.040]  So far it appears to be a digital version of fiat paper money.
[3:01:32.040 --> 3:01:37.040]  The Federal Reserve Bank is developing their own crypto called Fedcoin.
[3:01:37.040 --> 3:01:43.040]  The coronavirus pandemic seems to be the perfect storm for a global currency reset.
[3:01:43.040 --> 3:01:52.040]  The amount of money printing involved in holding up failing economies as quarantines and shutdowns take place will be unprecedented.
[3:01:52.040 --> 3:01:56.040]  And all this does is weaken the US dollar even more.
[3:01:56.040 --> 3:02:00.040]  And when the US dollar falls, it will be replaced by something.
[3:02:00.040 --> 3:02:04.040]  The question is, which way will it go?
[3:02:04.040 --> 3:02:07.040]  This is Greg Ries for infowars.com.
[3:02:07.040 --> 3:02:22.040]  And now, your Highness, the special location of your hidden other base.
[3:02:22.040 --> 3:02:26.040]  Infowars.
[3:02:26.040 --> 3:02:31.040]  Godfather of the Rothschild Banking Cartel, Mayor Amshel Rothschild said,
[3:02:31.040 --> 3:02:36.040]  give me control of a nation's money and I care not who makes the laws.
[3:02:36.040 --> 3:02:42.040]  In a recent Bloomberg article, the Fed's cure risks being worse than the disease.
[3:02:42.040 --> 3:02:49.040]  Jim Bianco explains what is now happening with the Federal Reserve Bank in their response to the coronavirus.
[3:02:49.040 --> 3:02:55.040]  He writes, this scheme essentially merges the Fed and Treasury into one organization.
[3:02:55.040 --> 3:02:59.040]  So meet your new Fed Chairman, Donald J. Trump.
[3:02:59.040 --> 3:03:04.040]  Did President Trump just nationalize the Federal Reserve Bank?
[3:03:04.040 --> 3:03:12.040]  On June 4, 1963, President John F. Kennedy issued executive order 1111-0,
[3:03:12.040 --> 3:03:19.040]  which many believed was an effort to transfer power from the Federal Reserve Bank to the United States Department of the Treasury
[3:03:19.040 --> 3:03:23.040]  by replacing Federal Reserve notes with silver certificates.
[3:03:23.040 --> 3:03:28.040]  Thereby taking the power away from the international banking cartels.
[3:03:28.040 --> 3:03:36.040]  Less than six months later, President Kennedy was assassinated, and his move against the Fed was reversed.
[3:03:36.040 --> 3:03:43.040]  During the Civil War, President Abraham Lincoln printed $400 million worth of greenbacks.
[3:03:43.040 --> 3:03:49.040]  A debt-free, interest-free money, independent of international bank control.
[3:03:49.040 --> 3:03:55.040]  In response, the London Times wrote that if that mischievous financial policy,
[3:03:55.040 --> 3:04:01.040]  which had its origin in the North American Republic, should become indurated down to a fixture,
[3:04:01.040 --> 3:04:05.040]  then that government will furnish its own money without cost.
[3:04:05.040 --> 3:04:08.040]  It will pay off debts and be without debt.
[3:04:08.040 --> 3:04:12.040]  It will have all the money necessary to carry on its commerce.
[3:04:12.040 --> 3:04:18.040]  It will become prosperous beyond precedent in the history of the civilized governments of the world.
[3:04:18.040 --> 3:04:22.040]  The brains and the wealth of all countries will go to North America.
[3:04:22.040 --> 3:04:29.040]  That government must be destroyed, or it will destroy every monarchy on the globe.
[3:04:29.040 --> 3:04:36.040]  The bankers were not willing to lose power, and the Bank of England went on to fund the Confederacy.
[3:04:36.040 --> 3:04:43.040]  Weeks prior to Lincoln's assassination, assassin John Wilkes Booth spent time in Montreal,
[3:04:43.040 --> 3:04:49.040]  known as the Confederate capital of Canada, and was found after the assassination
[3:04:49.040 --> 3:04:53.040]  with a bank note from Ontario Bank.
[3:04:53.040 --> 3:04:58.040]  Booth's personal manager was banker Joseph Siemens.
[3:04:58.040 --> 3:05:05.040]  After Lincoln was killed, power was restored to the international banking cartel.
[3:05:05.040 --> 3:05:11.040]  The National Economic Security and Recovery Act, known as NASARA,
[3:05:11.040 --> 3:05:19.040]  was a set of proposed economic reforms suggested during the 1990s by Harvey Francis Bernard.
[3:05:19.040 --> 3:05:23.040]  Bernard created the NASARA proposal during the late 1980s.
[3:05:23.040 --> 3:05:27.040]  He sent copies to members of Congress, but was ignored.
[3:05:27.040 --> 3:05:35.040]  In 2001, he established the NASARA Institute and published the second edition of his book in 2005,
[3:05:35.040 --> 3:05:43.040]  retitling it, Draining the Swamp, The NASARA Story, Monetary and Fiscal Policy Reform.
[3:05:43.040 --> 3:05:48.040]  The policies included replacing the income tax with a national sales tax,
[3:05:48.040 --> 3:05:55.040]  abolishing compound interest on secured loans, and returning to a bi-metallic currency,
[3:05:55.040 --> 3:06:00.040]  which he claimed would result in 0% inflation and a more stable economy.
[3:06:00.040 --> 3:06:08.040]  The full video is the Gregory section of Band-Aid video, but I saw this film 25 minutes long this morning.
[3:06:08.040 --> 3:06:12.040]  We're posting it to M4Wars.com, the link to the YouTube.
[3:06:12.040 --> 3:06:15.040]  But I thought all of you should have a chance to see it.
[3:06:15.040 --> 3:06:19.040]  So we're going to come back and air it. They did a great job, the great reset.
[3:06:19.040 --> 3:06:22.040]  He is straight ahead on the other side of this break.
[3:06:22.040 --> 3:06:27.040]  And you know, Google and the globalists all hope you don't share these links or tell folks about the show.
[3:06:27.040 --> 3:06:32.040]  Whatever you do, don't tell your email list, your Facebook, your Twitter, your text message.
[3:06:32.040 --> 3:06:36.040]  Tell no one to tune in now. Let the globalists win.
[3:06:36.040 --> 3:06:38.040]  I'm going to say something right now.
[3:06:38.040 --> 3:06:42.040]  It is one of the most important things I've ever said, so please listen very, very carefully.
[3:06:42.040 --> 3:06:48.040]  Donald Trump is not the reason they released COVID or had the lockdown.
[3:06:48.040 --> 3:06:53.040]  They already had this plan, the Rockefeller Foundation, and Bill of Melinda Gates.
[3:06:53.040 --> 3:06:58.040]  It is beyond critical. It is life and death for you and your family to understand.
[3:06:58.040 --> 3:07:06.040]  No matter where you live on the planet, but this is a worldwide world government takeover on record that it's never going to end.
[3:07:06.040 --> 3:07:12.040]  The United Nations has admitted that. First it's a month, then it's six months, then they say, okay, it's two years.
[3:07:12.040 --> 3:07:17.040]  They're now saying two years. They're now saying you'll never go back to normal.
[3:07:17.040 --> 3:07:23.040]  No more gatherings, no more anything, constant force inoculations that they admit don't even work.
[3:07:23.040 --> 3:07:26.040]  In the way they say they work, they change your DNA.
[3:07:26.040 --> 3:07:29.040]  This is the culling of the planet.
[3:07:29.040 --> 3:07:35.040]  This is the beginning of a straight jacket being put on you before you're slowly tortured to death and killed.
[3:07:35.040 --> 3:07:36.040]  Do you understand?
[3:07:36.040 --> 3:07:39.040]  This isn't about me taking credit. In fact, it's the opposite.
[3:07:39.040 --> 3:07:42.040]  It's about getting you to understand that you have all the power.
[3:07:42.040 --> 3:07:56.040]  Going back three weeks ago, they had the entire Austin Greenbelt shutdown and they had the spillway by Barton Springs shut down as well as the main pool that's always been paid for the last 50 years or so.
[3:07:56.040 --> 3:07:57.040]  It's a damned up spring.
[3:07:57.040 --> 3:08:07.040]  Well, we went down there and we got in the park at different areas around town in the last few weeks and educated people that it was all a giant fraud.
[3:08:07.040 --> 3:08:12.040]  And now, despite the fact that they still say the parks are closed, you get out to any area.
[3:08:12.040 --> 3:08:18.040]  You'll see dozens if not hundreds of people depending where you're at actually using Barton Springs here in Austin, Texas.
[3:08:18.040 --> 3:08:22.040]  So Bill Gates and the globalists give the orders to the UN.
[3:08:22.040 --> 3:08:26.040]  The UN gives the orders down through the National Health Services like our NIH.
[3:08:26.040 --> 3:08:28.040]  And we all follow it like dutiful slaves.
[3:08:28.040 --> 3:08:31.040]  Stop complying with your own enslavement.
[3:08:31.040 --> 3:08:34.040]  Stop following the orders of these globalist traders.
[3:08:34.040 --> 3:08:39.040]  Start being free again.
[3:08:39.040 --> 3:08:48.040]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:08:48.040 --> 3:09:07.040]  Almost heaven, West Virginia, Blue Ridge Mountains, Shenandoah River.
[3:09:07.040 --> 3:09:18.040]  Life is older, older than the trees, younger than the mountains, growing like a breeze.
[3:09:18.040 --> 3:09:28.040]  Country roads, take me home to the place I belong.
[3:09:28.040 --> 3:09:31.040]  The country's not safe unless you fight here in the cities.
[3:09:31.040 --> 3:09:33.040]  So we're here.
[3:09:33.040 --> 3:09:37.040]  All right.
[3:09:37.040 --> 3:09:42.040]  I feel good seeing all these impressive filmmakers and people I never knew about.
[3:09:42.040 --> 3:09:45.040]  Every day I found out about some new incredible soul.
[3:09:45.040 --> 3:09:48.040]  A man, a woman, brown, white, black.
[3:09:48.040 --> 3:09:51.040]  Beautiful souls that are fighting tyranny.
[3:09:51.040 --> 3:09:53.040]  And that's why you see the enemy coming into attack.
[3:09:53.040 --> 3:09:55.040]  It's what we posted the video.
[3:09:55.040 --> 3:10:01.040]  Tim4Wars.com with a few of the Greg Reese videos that foreshadowed this back in March.
[3:10:01.040 --> 3:10:05.040]  The great reset Davos and the plot to cancel Trump.
[3:10:05.040 --> 3:10:06.040]  And all this is very accurate.
[3:10:06.040 --> 3:10:08.040]  I've looked into it to myself.
[3:10:08.040 --> 3:10:17.040]  And the folks that put this out is the Remnant Video and the newspaper publisher who runs all of that.
[3:10:17.040 --> 3:10:19.040]  So you can find more information on it.
[3:10:19.040 --> 3:10:20.040]  We're posting it.
[3:10:20.040 --> 3:10:22.040]  Tim4Wars.com.
[3:10:22.040 --> 3:10:24.040]  Here is the beginning of the 25-minute documentary.
[3:10:24.040 --> 3:10:27.040]  We'll have time in this hour to air most of it or all of it.
[3:10:27.040 --> 3:10:28.040]  Here it is.
[3:10:28.040 --> 3:10:30.040]  Good stuff.
[3:10:30.040 --> 3:10:36.040]  I consider the Trump administration a danger to the world.
[3:10:36.040 --> 3:10:39.040]  That will disappear in 2020.
[3:10:39.040 --> 3:10:48.040]  What if I told you that Bill Gates, Greta Thunberg, Al Gore, George Soros, Prince Charles and Cardinal Turksin
[3:10:48.040 --> 3:10:54.040]  were meeting in the mountains to plot a global new order to be established on the back of the COVID pandemic?
[3:10:54.040 --> 3:10:56.040]  An outrageous movie plot?
[3:10:56.040 --> 3:10:58.040]  Or is it absolutely true?
[3:10:58.040 --> 3:11:01.040]  Donald Trump and the Davos Connection.
[3:11:01.040 --> 3:11:03.040]  Tonight from the Editor's Desk.
[3:11:14.040 --> 3:11:16.040]  Hello again, ladies and gentlemen.
[3:11:16.040 --> 3:11:20.040]  Michael Matt coming to you once again from the offices of the Remnant Newspaper.
[3:11:20.040 --> 3:11:24.040]  Here's something you're not apt to hear on mainstream media.
[3:11:24.040 --> 3:11:32.040]  Of the 18 million people in the world who've been infected with the coronavirus, 10.6 million have recovered.
[3:11:32.040 --> 3:11:37.040]  This is according to the latest figures from Johns Hopkins University.
[3:11:37.040 --> 3:11:42.040]  In other words, the vast majority of COVID patients fully recover.
[3:11:42.040 --> 3:11:49.040]  This doesn't even factor in that the millions who've contracted it recovered and didn't even know they had it.
[3:11:49.040 --> 3:11:51.040]  Friends, we need to have a talk.
[3:11:51.040 --> 3:11:54.040]  Let's be really clear right from the outset.
[3:11:54.040 --> 3:11:57.040]  COVID-19 is not a hoax, okay?
[3:11:57.040 --> 3:12:03.040]  Worldwide, over 650,000 people, mostly elderly, have succumbed to it.
[3:12:03.040 --> 3:12:05.040]  This is not a hoax.
[3:12:05.040 --> 3:12:11.040]  Even with skewed death reporting, which we know is going on all over the place, this is a very serious virus.
[3:12:11.040 --> 3:12:19.040]  But so was the H1N1, the swine flu of 2009, which claimed the lives of half a million people.
[3:12:19.040 --> 3:12:27.040]  So was the Hong Kong flu of 1968, which claimed the lives of up to 4 million people.
[3:12:27.040 --> 3:12:29.040]  Flu is a nasty business.
[3:12:29.040 --> 3:12:33.040]  Now, do you remember these previous epidemics, pandemics?
[3:12:33.040 --> 3:12:34.040]  Probably not. Why?
[3:12:34.040 --> 3:12:37.040]  Because the media didn't freak us out over those.
[3:12:37.040 --> 3:12:39.040]  The country wasn't shut down.
[3:12:39.040 --> 3:12:42.040]  Healthy people were not quarantined.
[3:12:42.040 --> 3:12:43.040]  Schools weren't closed.
[3:12:43.040 --> 3:12:46.040]  Church services weren't canceled.
[3:12:46.040 --> 3:12:47.040]  Why not?
[3:12:47.040 --> 3:12:53.040]  Because COVID is a thoroughly politicized virus.
[3:12:53.040 --> 3:13:01.040]  And we're getting conflicting recommendations from the experts that get just a little more absurd every week.
[3:13:01.040 --> 3:13:10.040]  Doctor, your colleague, Dr. Fauci, has suggested recently that goggles would work even better, or in addition to...
[3:13:10.040 --> 3:13:11.040]  You're talking about masks.
[3:13:11.040 --> 3:13:14.040]  People have come around to the reality of that.
[3:13:14.040 --> 3:13:18.040]  Are we going to look at more demands based on what Dr. Fauci has said?
[3:13:18.040 --> 3:13:22.040]  Well, I've seen really great face shields, and I've seen them around the country.
[3:13:22.040 --> 3:13:24.040]  You know, I've been out to 14 states.
[3:13:24.040 --> 3:13:26.040]  The administration sent me out.
[3:13:26.040 --> 3:13:32.040]  And I've gotten to see a lot of exciting face masks out there and face masks that come from the bottom up.
[3:13:32.040 --> 3:13:36.040]  And I think that's really, I think people, the American people are innovative.
[3:13:36.040 --> 3:13:39.040]  Those are actually pretty easy and straightforward to make.
[3:13:39.040 --> 3:13:44.040]  Many universities and those who have printers are making face shields now.
[3:13:44.040 --> 3:13:49.040]  So these 3-D printers can really increase that production, and I think others are making them.
[3:13:49.040 --> 3:13:51.040]  And they're going to be decorated.
[3:13:51.040 --> 3:13:54.040]  So, Doctor, well, no one's really interested in decorations.
[3:13:54.040 --> 3:13:58.040]  I want to know whether face shields or goggles is something we're going to hear next.
[3:13:58.040 --> 3:14:00.040]  This isn't even funny.
[3:14:00.040 --> 3:14:04.040]  I'm so glad to see the guys from Fox over there are openly mocking this woman.
[3:14:04.040 --> 3:14:07.040]  People are losing their jobs.
[3:14:07.040 --> 3:14:08.040]  They're losing their homes.
[3:14:08.040 --> 3:14:11.040]  They're losing their mental health over this.
[3:14:11.040 --> 3:14:13.040]  Their kids aren't going back to school.
[3:14:13.040 --> 3:14:14.040]  They can't go to church.
[3:14:14.040 --> 3:14:22.040]  And this delusional woman with the scarves thinks that we're going to get a kick out of decorating our face shields.
[3:14:22.040 --> 3:14:30.040]  This is day 170, I think, of the 15 days to slow the spread, Dr. Birx.
[3:14:30.040 --> 3:14:35.040]  Do you have any idea of what the hell you're talking about?
[3:14:35.040 --> 3:14:40.040]  Because it changes all the time. No wonder nobody takes these people seriously anymore.
[3:14:40.040 --> 3:14:42.040]  You see, here's the thing, friends.
[3:14:42.040 --> 3:14:44.040]  We need to get very serious about it.
[3:14:44.040 --> 3:14:46.040]  We didn't have a serious conversation about it.
[3:14:46.040 --> 3:14:50.040]  Here at the remnant, we've been saying since March, since the outset of this thing,
[3:14:50.040 --> 3:14:52.040]  that it's not the virus that we're questioning.
[3:14:52.040 --> 3:14:53.040]  I don't want to get the virus.
[3:14:53.040 --> 3:14:54.040]  I know you don't.
[3:14:54.040 --> 3:14:57.040]  I know some of you have lost loved ones or friends or whatever from the virus.
[3:14:57.040 --> 3:14:59.040]  I've known quite a few folks now who've gotten it.
[3:14:59.040 --> 3:15:00.040]  I don't know anyone who died.
[3:15:00.040 --> 3:15:01.040]  Everyone who I know.
[3:15:01.040 --> 3:15:03.040]  Thanks be to God has recovered.
[3:15:03.040 --> 3:15:05.040]  But it was never the virus that's the problem.
[3:15:05.040 --> 3:15:10.040]  It's the political exploitation of the pandemic, the COVID pandemic,
[3:15:10.040 --> 3:15:15.040]  that really, really must give all of us now serious cause for concern about the future.
[3:15:15.040 --> 3:15:18.040]  They're not playing games here.
[3:15:18.040 --> 3:15:19.040]  This isn't going anywhere.
[3:15:19.040 --> 3:15:20.040]  This isn't going away.
[3:15:20.040 --> 3:15:22.040]  And don't take my word for it.
[3:15:22.040 --> 3:15:24.040]  I wouldn't expect you to do that anyway.
[3:15:24.040 --> 3:15:26.040]  Let's talk about Davos, Switzerland.
[3:15:26.040 --> 3:15:30.040]  Here's where the leaders of the world are admitting exactly what I'm saying,
[3:15:30.040 --> 3:15:33.040]  that this is a Trojan horse.
[3:15:33.040 --> 3:15:36.040]  Now in Davos, they call it the Great Reset.
[3:15:36.040 --> 3:15:39.040]  And it's scheduled now to kick off in January 2021.
[3:15:39.040 --> 3:15:42.040]  And if you want to know what's really going on here,
[3:15:42.040 --> 3:15:44.040]  if you want to know why the schools are probably,
[3:15:44.040 --> 3:15:46.040]  many of them are not going to open in the fall,
[3:15:46.040 --> 3:15:50.040]  if you want to know why you're wearing that dehumanizing face mask,
[3:15:50.040 --> 3:15:57.040]  even in your car, look to Davos.
[3:15:57.040 --> 3:16:00.040]  Now is historical moments of time,
[3:16:00.040 --> 3:16:04.040]  not only to fight severe virus but to shape the system.
[3:16:04.040 --> 3:16:08.040]  We have a unique but rapidly shrinking window of opportunity
[3:16:08.040 --> 3:16:11.040]  to learn lessons and reset ourselves on a more sustainable path.
[3:16:11.040 --> 3:16:17.040]  What is it that would make it so that history would look at this crisis
[3:16:17.040 --> 3:16:21.040]  as the great opportunity for reset?
[3:16:21.040 --> 3:16:26.040]  The Great Reset is a welcome recognition that this human tragedy must be a wake-up call.
[3:16:26.040 --> 3:16:29.040]  The world's problems fit on three sides of a triangle.
[3:16:29.040 --> 3:16:33.040]  It's one versus many, man versus nature,
[3:16:33.040 --> 3:16:37.040]  and the unfortunate foundation is long-term versus short-term.
[3:16:37.040 --> 3:16:42.040]  Any recovery stimulus should have green conditions attached to it.
[3:16:42.040 --> 3:16:46.040]  We have to change our economies dramatically in the next 20 or 30 years
[3:16:46.040 --> 3:16:49.040]  and the next 10 years is absolutely decisive.
[3:16:49.040 --> 3:16:53.040]  The recovery has to be greener than any of the previous recoveries.
[3:16:53.040 --> 3:16:56.040]  And then we need to couple that with new initiatives to equip us.
[3:16:56.040 --> 3:16:57.040]  We're going to come back.
[3:16:57.040 --> 3:17:00.040]  And this is all Davos, Microsoft Global, is saying,
[3:17:00.040 --> 3:17:04.040]  this is going to teach us to not have money and to be poor.
[3:17:04.040 --> 3:17:06.040]  And that's how you save yourself.
[3:17:06.040 --> 3:17:08.040]  It's not having a car, going to a job,
[3:17:08.040 --> 3:17:11.040]  and then we're going to dictate how you live your life now.
[3:17:11.040 --> 3:17:12.040]  This is all they're doing.
[3:17:12.040 --> 3:17:13.040]  It's just shutting everything off.
[3:17:13.040 --> 3:17:18.040]  Old little livings think they're heroes saving the earth by not doing anything.
[3:17:18.040 --> 3:17:22.040]  But no, they're just setting it up for themselves to be obsolete
[3:17:22.040 --> 3:17:27.040]  because they act like chicken neck cowards that don't have any will to defend themselves.
[3:17:27.040 --> 3:17:30.040]  And if you act like a sheep, you know what comes.
[3:17:30.040 --> 3:17:33.040]  Not eat your bunnies, but the big bad wolf.
[3:17:33.040 --> 3:17:34.040]  Stay with us.
[3:17:36.040 --> 3:17:39.040]  There's a nauseating sense to it.
[3:17:39.040 --> 3:17:43.040]  Not a sense of triumph, not a sense of victory,
[3:17:43.040 --> 3:17:46.040]  not a sense of completion,
[3:17:46.040 --> 3:17:50.040]  a sense of sixth nausea.
[3:17:50.040 --> 3:17:52.040]  Though we were right about the world government,
[3:17:52.040 --> 3:17:55.040]  we were right about the anti-human plans,
[3:17:55.040 --> 3:17:59.040]  we were right about all the horrible things, the globalists,
[3:17:59.040 --> 3:18:02.040]  and their satanic order wanted to do to us.
[3:18:02.040 --> 3:18:04.040]  And now we sit here,
[3:18:04.040 --> 3:18:07.040]  warning people for decades, trying to get people ready,
[3:18:07.040 --> 3:18:09.040]  trying to stop what was coming.
[3:18:09.040 --> 3:18:11.040]  But you know what?
[3:18:11.040 --> 3:18:15.040]  Revelations in God's word says it's coming so you can't stop it.
[3:18:15.040 --> 3:18:18.040]  And it's in that understanding that we're part of God's larger plan
[3:18:18.040 --> 3:18:22.040]  that we come to the point in our own psyche,
[3:18:22.040 --> 3:18:25.040]  our own spirit, our own will that we submit to God
[3:18:25.040 --> 3:18:28.040]  and realize God's in charge of God as a part.
[3:18:28.040 --> 3:18:31.040]  And the devil is set as a tester.
[3:18:31.040 --> 3:18:33.040]  And now it's up to us to make the right decision.
[3:18:33.040 --> 3:18:59.040]  That's what it's really always been about.
[3:19:03.040 --> 3:19:05.040]  The very best items, the very best products
[3:19:05.040 --> 3:19:08.040]  that I personally use and I love.

[3:19:23.040 --> 3:19:26.040]  I want to thank you for funding our operation.
[3:19:26.040 --> 3:19:28.040]  So continue to spread the word and fund InfoWars

[3:20:22.040 --> 3:20:25.040]  Your support of InfoWars has stood in defiance
[3:20:25.040 --> 3:20:28.040]  of George Soros, the globalist, Hillary,
[3:20:28.040 --> 3:20:29.040]  and all these comebacks.
[3:20:29.040 --> 3:20:32.040]  So great job. You built what we've done.
[3:20:32.040 --> 3:21:00.040]  I salute you.
[3:21:02.040 --> 3:21:05.040]  It's Alex Jones.
[3:21:32.040 --> 3:21:34.040]  Thank you so much.
[3:22:02.040 --> 3:22:06.040]  I hope you share it.
[3:22:06.040 --> 3:22:09.040]  And just another well-spoken good group laying out the facts
[3:22:09.040 --> 3:22:13.040]  of Davos and others bragging about what they're now doing to us.
[3:22:13.040 --> 3:22:15.040]  So let's continue with the documentary.
[3:22:15.040 --> 3:22:18.040]  Who's so?
[3:22:18.040 --> 3:22:22.040]  In June 2nd, 2020, just a few months ago, a couple months ago,
[3:22:22.040 --> 3:22:26.040]  the founder now of the World Economic Forum in Davos,
[3:22:26.040 --> 3:22:29.040]  Klaus Schwab, wrote an article on their website
[3:22:29.040 --> 3:22:31.040]  in which he just comes right out with it.
[3:22:31.040 --> 3:22:34.040]  He says that COVID pandemic represents a, quote,
[3:22:34.040 --> 3:22:38.040]  rare but narrow window of opportunity to reflect,
[3:22:38.040 --> 3:22:41.040]  reimagine, and reset our world.
[3:22:41.040 --> 3:22:43.040]  End quote, those are my words.
[3:22:43.040 --> 3:22:45.040]  Those are his words.
[3:22:45.040 --> 3:22:50.040]  The world must act jointly and swiftly, says Mr. Schwab,
[3:22:50.040 --> 3:22:55.040]  to, quote, revamp all aspects of our societies and economies
[3:22:55.040 --> 3:22:59.040]  from education to social contracts and working conditions.
[3:22:59.040 --> 3:23:02.040]  Every country from the United States to China
[3:23:02.040 --> 3:23:07.040]  must participate, and every industry from oil and gas to tech
[3:23:07.040 --> 3:23:11.040]  must be transformed, end quote.
[3:23:11.040 --> 3:23:15.040]  And Mr. Schwab comes right out and admits that he can't do this
[3:23:15.040 --> 3:23:18.040]  without, you guessed it, Bill Gates.
[3:23:18.040 --> 3:23:21.040]  We are particularly committed to this initiative
[3:23:21.040 --> 3:23:26.040]  since the forum has been at the origin in its annual meeting
[3:23:26.040 --> 3:23:31.040]  in Davos of the Global Fund, GAVI and CEPI.
[3:23:31.040 --> 3:23:36.040]  Together with the Gates Foundation and other founders
[3:23:36.040 --> 3:23:41.040]  of so-as-crucial organizations, particularly today.
[3:23:41.040 --> 3:23:42.040]  And they're all there.
[3:23:42.040 --> 3:23:46.040]  All the movers and shakers of the world are in Davos,
[3:23:46.040 --> 3:23:48.040]  at one time or another.
[3:23:48.040 --> 3:23:51.040]  Even Prince Charles, the insufferable Prince of Wales,
[3:23:51.040 --> 3:23:53.040]  got into the act in Davos in January.
[3:23:53.040 --> 3:23:56.040]  Unless we take the action necessary
[3:23:56.040 --> 3:24:01.040]  and we build again in a greener and more sustainable
[3:24:01.040 --> 3:24:03.040]  and more inclusive way,
[3:24:03.040 --> 3:24:06.040]  then we will end up having more and more pandemics
[3:24:06.040 --> 3:24:08.040]  and more and more disasters
[3:24:08.040 --> 3:24:12.040]  from ever accelerating global warming and climate change.
[3:24:12.040 --> 3:24:17.040]  So this is the one moment, as you've all been saying,
[3:24:17.040 --> 3:24:22.040]  when we have to make as much progress as we can.
[3:24:22.040 --> 3:24:24.040]  And of course, Antonio Guterres,
[3:24:24.040 --> 3:24:26.040]  the former Prime Minister of Portugal,
[3:24:26.040 --> 3:24:28.040]  who's also a Catholic and is now serving
[3:24:28.040 --> 3:24:30.040]  as the Secretary General of the United Nations.
[3:24:30.040 --> 3:24:33.040]  He's in Davos chiming in as well.
[3:24:33.040 --> 3:24:36.040]  A microscopic virus has closed down
[3:24:36.040 --> 3:24:39.040]  entire countries and economies.
[3:24:39.040 --> 3:24:41.040]  The Great Reset is a welcome recognition
[3:24:41.040 --> 3:24:45.040]  that this human tragedy must be a wake-up call.
[3:24:45.040 --> 3:24:48.040]  As you rightly say, it is imperative that we reimagine,
[3:24:48.040 --> 3:24:53.040]  rebuild, redesign, reinvigorate and rebalance our world.
[3:24:53.040 --> 3:24:56.040]  Friends, the full picture should begin to emerge now.
[3:24:56.040 --> 3:24:58.040]  And I'm just giving you a sample.
[3:24:58.040 --> 3:25:00.040]  I mean, everyone has spoken here.
[3:25:00.040 --> 3:25:02.040]  Everyone who is anyone in the globalist community
[3:25:02.040 --> 3:25:04.040]  has gone to Davos as delivered speeches.
[3:25:04.040 --> 3:25:08.040]  They come together, they network, they plan our future.
[3:25:08.040 --> 3:25:11.040]  This transformation essentially means
[3:25:11.040 --> 3:25:14.040]  that the whole way that we do business,
[3:25:14.040 --> 3:25:16.040]  that we live,
[3:25:16.040 --> 3:25:19.040]  that we have grown accustomed to in the industrial age,
[3:25:19.040 --> 3:25:21.040]  will have to be changed.
[3:25:21.040 --> 3:25:24.040]  We will have to leave that behind us in the next 30 years to go.
[3:25:24.040 --> 3:25:27.040]  This COVID thing is their golden opportunity.
[3:25:27.040 --> 3:25:29.040]  And they certainly don't want Trump or anyone else
[3:25:29.040 --> 3:25:32.040]  to fix the problem, certainly not prematurely.
[3:25:32.040 --> 3:25:35.040]  And this is what the war on Hydroxychloroquine is all about.
[3:25:35.040 --> 3:25:37.040]  I mean, think about this. Why?
[3:25:37.040 --> 3:25:39.040]  You mentioned Hydroxychloroquine
[3:25:39.040 --> 3:25:41.040]  and you get taken off Facebook?
[3:25:41.040 --> 3:25:43.040]  You get taken down from YouTube? Why?
[3:25:43.040 --> 3:25:45.040]  This thing has been going for 60 years.
[3:25:45.040 --> 3:25:46.040]  People use it all the time.
[3:25:46.040 --> 3:25:48.040]  Well, if you use it, you might have a heart attack,
[3:25:48.040 --> 3:25:49.040]  so we've got to condemn that.
[3:25:49.040 --> 3:25:50.040]  Why are they doing this?
[3:25:50.040 --> 3:25:52.040]  This is a therapeutic that works for a lot of people.
[3:25:52.040 --> 3:25:54.040]  Doctors all over the place are using it right now,
[3:25:54.040 --> 3:25:56.040]  but they don't want it. Why?
[3:25:56.040 --> 3:25:58.040]  Why? Because it's not a vaccine.
[3:25:58.040 --> 3:26:00.040]  Because it might fix the problem.
[3:26:00.040 --> 3:26:03.040]  This is why those frontline doctors in the white coats,
[3:26:03.040 --> 3:26:05.040]  that's why they were banned from social media.
[3:26:05.040 --> 3:26:07.040]  Many of them are now losing their jobs.
[3:26:07.040 --> 3:26:09.040]  They were frontline heroes.
[3:26:09.040 --> 3:26:12.040]  And all they did wrong was come out and talk about fixing the thing now.
[3:26:12.040 --> 3:26:14.040]  Not waiting 18 months.
[3:26:14.040 --> 3:26:16.040]  You're not waiting for a vaccine,
[3:26:16.040 --> 3:26:18.040]  but how they're fixing and healing people right now
[3:26:18.040 --> 3:26:23.040]  doesn't that make you just a little suspicious?
[3:26:23.040 --> 3:26:25.040]  Because I see the problem is these frontline doctors
[3:26:25.040 --> 3:26:27.040]  in the white coats, if they're right,
[3:26:27.040 --> 3:26:30.040]  and COVID can be cured without 7 billion doses
[3:26:30.040 --> 3:26:33.040]  of Bill Gates' vaccine,
[3:26:33.040 --> 3:26:35.040]  well, the great reset that they keep talking about
[3:26:35.040 --> 3:26:37.040]  in Davos, Switzerland, the great reset
[3:26:37.040 --> 3:26:40.040]  will be dead on arrival.
[3:26:40.040 --> 3:26:42.040]  And all of us will go back to life.
[3:26:42.040 --> 3:26:44.040]  Life as we knew it.
[3:26:44.040 --> 3:26:47.040]  This is why the 2021 Davos Summit now,
[3:26:47.040 --> 3:26:49.040]  2021, it's coming right up after Christmas.
[3:26:49.040 --> 3:26:52.040]  The Davos Summit and the great reset,
[3:26:52.040 --> 3:26:55.040]  they need President Joe the Catholic Biden
[3:26:55.040 --> 3:26:58.040]  to hand us, the United States, over to them
[3:26:58.040 --> 3:27:00.040]  if he wins this election.
[3:27:00.040 --> 3:27:02.040]  This is why they're trying so hard
[3:27:02.040 --> 3:27:04.040]  to take Donald Trump down.
[3:27:04.040 --> 3:27:07.040]  Biden is not a serious candidate.
[3:27:07.040 --> 3:27:08.040]  We can all agree on that, right?
[3:27:08.040 --> 3:27:09.040]  He's not serious.
[3:27:09.040 --> 3:27:11.040]  The poor fellow, he's in his dotage now.
[3:27:11.040 --> 3:27:12.040]  So what are they doing?
[3:27:12.040 --> 3:27:14.040]  They don't want a serious candidate.
[3:27:14.040 --> 3:27:15.040]  I'm not talking about on the right.
[3:27:15.040 --> 3:27:16.040]  I'm talking about on the left.
[3:27:16.040 --> 3:27:19.040]  They don't want someone who's going to be serious.
[3:27:19.040 --> 3:27:21.040]  Everyone with a pulse knows
[3:27:21.040 --> 3:27:23.040]  Joe Biden can't do this job.
[3:27:23.040 --> 3:27:25.040]  What's he doing there then?
[3:27:25.040 --> 3:27:29.040]  In my opinion, he's the personified monument
[3:27:29.040 --> 3:27:31.040]  to the U.S. presidency
[3:27:31.040 --> 3:27:34.040]  that the mob will tear down in January.
[3:27:34.040 --> 3:27:36.040]  They need to reset everything,
[3:27:36.040 --> 3:27:38.040]  including the politics of the United States,
[3:27:38.040 --> 3:27:41.040]  the governance of the United States.
[3:27:41.040 --> 3:27:44.040]  Besides that, old Joe the Catholic Biden
[3:27:44.040 --> 3:27:47.040]  has always been a new world order guy.
[3:27:47.040 --> 3:27:50.040]  The affirmative task we have now
[3:27:50.040 --> 3:27:57.040]  is to actually create a new world order.
[3:27:57.040 --> 3:27:58.040]  And of course, friends,
[3:27:58.040 --> 3:28:00.040]  we hear a lot about the Green New Deal
[3:28:00.040 --> 3:28:01.040]  and all of that, right?
[3:28:01.040 --> 3:28:03.040]  We hear Francis with his Laudato Si and Cyclical
[3:28:03.040 --> 3:28:04.040]  and all of that.
[3:28:04.040 --> 3:28:05.040]  They're all working together, aren't they?
[3:28:05.040 --> 3:28:08.040]  The Davos 2021 summit works closely
[3:28:08.040 --> 3:28:11.040]  with something called Climate Reality Project.
[3:28:11.040 --> 3:28:12.040]  And guess who runs that?
[3:28:12.040 --> 3:28:16.040]  The respected trustee of the World Economic Forum,
[3:28:16.040 --> 3:28:18.040]  Albert Gore.
[3:28:18.040 --> 3:28:21.040]  This crisis, the climate crisis,
[3:28:21.040 --> 3:28:24.040]  is way worse than people generally realize.
[3:28:24.040 --> 3:28:26.040]  Way worse.
[3:28:26.040 --> 3:28:31.040]  It is getting worse still way faster than people realize.
[3:28:31.040 --> 3:28:33.040]  The burden to act
[3:28:33.040 --> 3:28:35.040]  that is on the shoulders of the generation
[3:28:35.040 --> 3:28:37.040]  of people alive today
[3:28:37.040 --> 3:28:39.040]  is a challenge to our moral imagination.
[3:28:39.040 --> 3:28:41.040]  But this is thermopoly.
[3:28:41.040 --> 3:28:43.040]  This is Agincourt.
[3:28:43.040 --> 3:28:44.040]  This is the Battle of the Bulge.
[3:28:44.040 --> 3:28:45.040]  This is Dunkirk.
[3:28:45.040 --> 3:28:47.040]  This is 9-11.
[3:28:47.040 --> 3:28:50.040]  We have to rise to this occasion.
[3:28:50.040 --> 3:28:53.040]  I can't believe this guy is still knocking around.
[3:28:53.040 --> 3:28:54.040]  It's unbelievable.
[3:28:54.040 --> 3:28:57.040]  It's almost like a spoof, isn't it?
[3:28:57.040 --> 3:29:00.040]  It's Al again.
[3:29:00.040 --> 3:29:02.040]  I mean, and it's the same.
[3:29:02.040 --> 3:29:03.040]  Davos brings them all in.
[3:29:03.040 --> 3:29:06.040]  All the ghouls from the global swamp.
[3:29:06.040 --> 3:29:10.040]  Our house is still on fire.
[3:29:10.040 --> 3:29:15.040]  Your inaction is fueling the flames by the hour.
[3:29:15.040 --> 3:29:18.040]  And we are telling you to act
[3:29:18.040 --> 3:29:21.040]  as if you loved your children above all else.
[3:29:21.040 --> 3:29:24.040]  And of course, drum roll please.
[3:29:24.040 --> 3:29:29.040]  Davos Switzerland has its elder statesman, George Soros.
[3:29:29.040 --> 3:29:33.040]  George Soros' dinner at Davos is a bit of an institution
[3:29:33.040 --> 3:29:34.040]  at this event.
[3:29:34.040 --> 3:29:37.040]  He usually comes out with strong criticism of something
[3:29:37.040 --> 3:29:40.040]  that he feels is troubling for the state of the world.
[3:29:40.040 --> 3:29:43.040]  He didn't hold back either when talking about the US president
[3:29:43.040 --> 3:29:45.040]  saying that he was describing him as a con man,
[3:29:45.040 --> 3:29:46.040]  an ultimate narcissist.
[3:29:46.040 --> 3:29:50.040]  Even the fate of the world could be at stake in 2020
[3:29:50.040 --> 3:29:51.040]  in the years to come as well.
[3:29:51.040 --> 3:29:54.040]  Perhaps referencing the upcoming election
[3:29:54.040 --> 3:29:56.040]  in the United States too.
[3:29:56.040 --> 3:29:59.040]  So George Soros really, you know, using his platform here
[3:29:59.040 --> 3:30:02.040]  at Davos to speak to those, you know, rich and famous
[3:30:02.040 --> 3:30:05.040]  who come to the World Economic Forum.
[3:30:05.040 --> 3:30:08.040]  We know that he's in the past has been a major donor
[3:30:08.040 --> 3:30:10.040]  to the Democratic Party in the United States.
[3:30:10.040 --> 3:30:12.040]  He didn't say anything about which candidate he might be
[3:30:12.040 --> 3:30:14.040]  supporting in the Democratic primary,
[3:30:14.040 --> 3:30:17.040]  but certainly no holding back on his criticism
[3:30:17.040 --> 3:30:18.040]  of President Trump.
[3:30:18.040 --> 3:30:19.040]  Look at that demon.
[3:30:19.040 --> 3:30:21.040]  We'll come back with a conclusion of the film.
[3:30:21.040 --> 3:30:25.040]  The Great Reset is posted at infowars.com.
[3:30:25.040 --> 3:30:26.040]  It's a good little piece.
[3:30:26.040 --> 3:30:29.040]  The Great Reset, Davos, the plot to cancel Trump.
[3:30:29.040 --> 3:30:58.040]  It's the plot to cancel you and your family, Davos.
[3:30:59.040 --> 3:31:00.040]  New taxes.
[3:31:00.040 --> 3:31:03.040]  If you elect me, your taxes are going to be raised, not cut.
[3:31:03.040 --> 3:31:07.040]  Promising amnesty and health care for 11 million illegal immigrants.
[3:31:07.040 --> 3:31:10.040]  Citizenship for 11 million undocumented folks.
[3:31:10.040 --> 3:31:13.040]  Promising to shut down energy exploration,
[3:31:13.040 --> 3:31:16.040]  killing jobs and hurting America's economy.
[3:31:16.040 --> 3:31:19.040]  I guarantee we're going to end fossil fuel.
[3:31:19.040 --> 3:31:23.040]  In Joe Biden's America, the radical left get whatever they want
[3:31:23.040 --> 3:31:25.040]  and you get to pay for it.
[3:31:25.040 --> 3:31:29.040]  They've already taken over Joe Biden and the Democratic Party.
[3:31:29.040 --> 3:31:55.040]  Don't let them take over America.
[3:31:55.040 --> 3:32:00.040]  It didn't mean that those parties didn't have differences before.
[3:32:00.040 --> 3:32:03.040]  They were able to get control of the leadership of both
[3:32:03.040 --> 3:32:06.040]  and manipulate the public with the illusion of change
[3:32:06.040 --> 3:32:10.040]  and the illusion of a fight going on like WWF wrestling or something.
[3:32:10.040 --> 3:32:14.040]  With Trump and with our populist movement taking over the Republicans,
[3:32:14.040 --> 3:32:16.040]  this is a real populist movement.
[3:32:16.040 --> 3:32:17.040]  Doesn't mean it's perfect.
[3:32:17.040 --> 3:32:20.040]  And you know it's real because the Democrats, the power structure,
[3:32:20.040 --> 3:32:23.040]  the China comms and the entire old Republican leadership
[3:32:23.040 --> 3:32:25.040]  are now supporting Trump.
[3:32:25.040 --> 3:32:27.040]  It's about Americanism, not globalism.
[3:32:27.040 --> 3:32:29.040]  It's about ending the one-sided trade deals.
[3:32:29.040 --> 3:32:31.040]  It's about defending our borders.
[3:32:31.040 --> 3:32:33.040]  It's about defending the right to Second Amendment and pro-life.
[3:32:33.040 --> 3:33:02.040]  All of that.
[3:33:02.040 --> 3:33:05.040]  This is the corporate planetary takeover.
[3:33:05.040 --> 3:33:08.040]  So yes, I stand by what I said 10 years ago,
[3:33:08.040 --> 3:33:11.040]  what I said a year ago, and what I said last week more than ever.

[3:33:34.040 --> 3:33:39.040]  Introducing Infowar's Life, pure turmeric extract.
[3:33:39.040 --> 3:33:41.040]  This is taken under the tongue.
[3:33:41.040 --> 3:33:43.040]  It is pure turmeric.
[3:33:43.040 --> 3:33:48.040]  It goes together very well with our body's ultimate turmeric formula
[3:33:48.040 --> 3:33:53.040]  that is taken as a powdered capsule and absorbed in the stomach and intestines.
[3:33:53.040 --> 3:33:56.040]  This is absorbed under the tongue into the bloodstream
[3:33:56.040 --> 3:33:59.040]  and then the remaining also is then absorbed by the stomach.
[3:33:59.040 --> 3:34:01.040]  So it's more of an intense delivery system.
[3:34:01.040 --> 3:34:04.040]  The two formulas are different, but both are concentrated.
[3:34:04.040 --> 3:34:06.040]  And our first product got rave reviews.
[3:34:06.040 --> 3:34:08.040]  We've now been testing this out for several months.
[3:34:08.040 --> 3:34:10.040]  Some of our staff like it more than bodies.
[3:34:10.040 --> 3:34:12.040]  Some like bodies better.
[3:34:12.040 --> 3:34:15.040]  For me, they're both amazing for their anti-inflammatory action
[3:34:15.040 --> 3:34:17.040]  and so much more, and they fund the Infowar.

[3:34:27.040 --> 3:34:30.040]  Turmeric is renowned for what it does for all of our bodies,
[3:34:30.040 --> 3:34:32.040]  for inflammation and so much more.
[3:34:32.040 --> 3:34:35.040]  Get yours today at infowarslife.com.
[3:34:38.040 --> 3:34:42.040]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[3:34:42.040 --> 3:34:49.040]  So the piece we're playing is called The Great Reset, Davos,
[3:34:49.040 --> 3:34:54.040]  and the plot to cancel trumpets at infowars.com and newswars.com.
[3:34:54.040 --> 3:34:58.040]  And George Soros hopes you don't share it, but here's the conclusion.
[3:34:58.040 --> 3:35:00.040]  So what's this all about?
[3:35:00.040 --> 3:35:01.040]  I think you know.
[3:35:01.040 --> 3:35:03.040]  I think we all sort of in our hearts,
[3:35:03.040 --> 3:35:04.040]  we kind of realize what's going on here.
[3:35:04.040 --> 3:35:06.040]  This is not about COVID anymore.
[3:35:06.040 --> 3:35:08.040]  This is about a reset of everything.
[3:35:08.040 --> 3:35:12.040]  And the United States of America is in the way right now of all of it.
[3:35:12.040 --> 3:35:16.040]  So they are destabilizing our entire country.
[3:35:16.040 --> 3:35:19.040]  The Great Reset, then politically, economically,
[3:35:19.040 --> 3:35:22.040]  it wants to implement massive socialist programs.
[3:35:22.040 --> 3:35:26.040]  And of course, global climate change along the lines of the Green New Deal.
[3:35:26.040 --> 3:35:28.040]  The regulation is going to be unbelievable.
[3:35:28.040 --> 3:35:31.040]  And no one, no country will be allowed to opt out of this.
[3:35:31.040 --> 3:35:32.040]  Why?
[3:35:32.040 --> 3:35:36.040]  Well, if an individual country opts out of the Green New Deal,
[3:35:36.040 --> 3:35:40.040]  if an individual country opts out of the Great Reset,
[3:35:40.040 --> 3:35:43.040]  they're going to be endangering the whole world community,
[3:35:43.040 --> 3:35:45.040]  the whole world through future pandemics
[3:35:45.040 --> 3:35:48.040]  that will be caused by climate change, Al Gore says,
[3:35:48.040 --> 3:35:51.040]  and overpopulation, says Bill Gates.
[3:35:51.040 --> 3:35:52.040]  You see how it works?
[3:35:52.040 --> 3:35:55.040]  No country will be allowed to opt out.
[3:35:55.040 --> 3:35:59.040]  This is what we're facing in November.
[3:35:59.040 --> 3:36:03.040]  And if you think the Catholic Church is going to protect you
[3:36:03.040 --> 3:36:07.040]  and it's coming from this globalist takeover nightmare,
[3:36:07.040 --> 3:36:08.040]  think again.
[3:36:08.040 --> 3:36:10.040]  We've been through all this before,
[3:36:10.040 --> 3:36:12.040]  leaving aside Pacha Mama,
[3:36:12.040 --> 3:36:15.040]  and leaving aside Laudato Si,
[3:36:15.040 --> 3:36:17.040]  which is the encyclical of the globalist.
[3:36:17.040 --> 3:36:19.040]  It's the encyclical of the United Nations.
[3:36:19.040 --> 3:36:23.040]  I'm sure that we have all read this magnificent,
[3:36:23.040 --> 3:36:28.040]  magnificent encyclical that His Holiness Pope Francis
[3:36:28.040 --> 3:36:31.040]  has blessed us with.
[3:36:31.040 --> 3:36:33.040]  It's the encyclical of AOC.
[3:36:33.040 --> 3:36:36.040]  It's the encyclical of the Green New Deal.
[3:36:36.040 --> 3:36:39.040]  Leaving that aside, Francis has already announced
[3:36:39.040 --> 3:36:42.040]  the global economic reset of his own last year.
[3:36:42.040 --> 3:36:45.040]  I don't know what makes this man think that he's an economist.
[3:36:45.040 --> 3:36:47.040]  I don't know where he learned all of this down in Argentina,
[3:36:47.040 --> 3:36:49.040]  but he's an amazing guy.
[3:36:49.040 --> 3:36:51.040]  He knows everything but theology.
[3:36:51.040 --> 3:36:53.040]  Have you noticed that?
[3:36:53.040 --> 3:36:57.040]  He already announced his coming global economic reset.
[3:36:57.040 --> 3:37:01.040]  He calls it, in his humility, the economy of Francesco,
[3:37:01.040 --> 3:37:03.040]  the economy of Francis.
[3:37:03.040 --> 3:37:05.040]  Remember, we showed you a bit of this.
[3:37:05.040 --> 3:37:06.040]  I'll show you a little more here.
[3:37:06.040 --> 3:37:08.040]  I will come for the economy of Francesco
[3:37:08.040 --> 3:37:12.040]  because we need a new economy, a new vision,
[3:37:12.040 --> 3:37:17.040]  and the teachings of Pope Francis in Laudato Si
[3:37:17.040 --> 3:37:20.040]  and in other teachings help to give us...
[3:37:20.040 --> 3:37:22.040]  The ultra-rich that have stolen all the wealth
[3:37:22.040 --> 3:37:23.040]  now have this plan.
[3:37:23.040 --> 3:37:25.040]  Isn't that something?
[3:37:25.040 --> 3:37:29.040]  He announced last year, mid-2019.
[3:37:29.040 --> 3:37:33.040]  It's almost as if Francis knew that the COVID pandemic
[3:37:33.040 --> 3:37:36.040]  and the resulting economic collapse were coming.
[3:37:36.040 --> 3:37:38.040]  I wonder how he knew that.
[3:37:38.040 --> 3:37:42.040]  Isn't that weird that he was already calling for an economic reset?
[3:37:42.040 --> 3:37:44.040]  When Pope Francis, he couldn't make it out to Davos
[3:37:44.040 --> 3:37:46.040]  back in January when the big party happened,
[3:37:46.040 --> 3:37:48.040]  but he did send his representative,
[3:37:48.040 --> 3:37:52.040]  the globalist cardinal, Peter Turksen, in his place.
[3:37:52.040 --> 3:37:54.040]  Ladies and gentlemen,
[3:37:54.040 --> 3:37:57.040]  I am pleased to welcome his Eminence Cardinal Turksen,
[3:37:57.040 --> 3:38:00.040]  prefect of the Dicastry for Promoting
[3:38:00.040 --> 3:38:04.040]  Integral Human Development of the Vatican City-State,
[3:38:04.040 --> 3:38:07.040]  with a special message from his Holiness Pope Francis.
[3:38:07.040 --> 3:38:11.040]  Your Eminence, it is a pleasure to welcome you back to Davos.
[3:38:11.040 --> 3:38:13.040]  The stage is yours.
[3:38:13.040 --> 3:38:16.040]  This is to Professor Klaus Schwab,
[3:38:16.040 --> 3:38:23.040]  Executive Chairman of the World Economic Forum.
[3:38:23.040 --> 3:38:29.040]  As the World Economic Forum celebrates its 50th anniversary,
[3:38:29.040 --> 3:38:33.040]  I send greetings and prayerful good wishes
[3:38:33.040 --> 3:38:38.040]  to all taking part in this year's gathering.
[3:38:38.040 --> 3:38:40.040]  Everyone's in on the great reset.
[3:38:40.040 --> 3:38:42.040]  Well, almost everyone.
[3:38:42.040 --> 3:38:44.040]  There's one guy who's got the power to do something to stop
[3:38:44.040 --> 3:38:46.040]  and he knows exactly where I'm going.
[3:38:46.040 --> 3:38:48.040]  And they made a mistake.
[3:38:48.040 --> 3:38:50.040]  They tried to get Trump on their side,
[3:38:50.040 --> 3:38:52.040]  so they invited Donald Trump to Davos, I think a couple of times.
[3:38:52.040 --> 3:38:54.040]  But in January, when Donald Trump, I think,
[3:38:54.040 --> 3:38:57.040]  really began to see the beast that he was up against,
[3:38:57.040 --> 3:39:00.040]  he went to Davos, yet to the World Economic Forum,
[3:39:00.040 --> 3:39:04.040]  and he stuck a mega-finger in their eye.
[3:39:04.040 --> 3:39:09.040]  We're committed to conserving the majesty of God's creation
[3:39:09.040 --> 3:39:11.040]  and the natural beauty of our world.
[3:39:11.040 --> 3:39:14.040]  But to embrace the possibilities of tomorrow,
[3:39:14.040 --> 3:39:17.040]  we must reject the perennial prophets of doom
[3:39:17.040 --> 3:39:21.040]  and their predictions of the apocalypse.
[3:39:21.040 --> 3:39:24.040]  These alarmists always demand the same thing,
[3:39:24.040 --> 3:39:26.040]  absolute power to dominate, transform,
[3:39:26.040 --> 3:39:29.040]  and control every aspect of our lives.
[3:39:29.040 --> 3:39:34.040]  We will never let radical socialists destroy our economy, wreck our country.
[3:39:34.040 --> 3:39:37.040]  Two days after Donald Trump gave that speech,
[3:39:37.040 --> 3:39:42.040]  the 89-year-old leftist weirdo billionaire George Soros
[3:39:42.040 --> 3:39:46.040]  made an emergency intervention where, at Davos once again,
[3:39:46.040 --> 3:39:51.040]  warning that the U.S. 2020 election will determine the quote,
[3:39:51.040 --> 3:39:53.040]  fate of the whole world.
[3:39:53.040 --> 3:39:57.040]  Now, in the context of Davos, take a look at this one more time.
[3:39:57.040 --> 3:40:01.040]  This is a month after Donald Trump addressed Davos
[3:40:01.040 --> 3:40:03.040]  and stuck the mega-finger in their face.
[3:40:03.040 --> 3:40:07.040]  Here's what Francis the Vatican and Jeffrey Sachs had to say in response.
[3:40:07.040 --> 3:40:11.040]  And it is a dangerous country right now.
[3:40:11.040 --> 3:40:15.040]  It will be absolutely dangerous if Trump wins reelection.
[3:40:15.040 --> 3:40:17.040]  Trump wins reelection.
[3:40:17.040 --> 3:40:19.040]  Trump wins reelection.
[3:40:19.040 --> 3:40:25.040]  Francis invited this guy to the Amazon Senate as an honored guest and advisor.
[3:40:25.040 --> 3:40:28.040]  He's also Bernie Sanders' advisor.
[3:40:28.040 --> 3:40:29.040]  What's he doing in the Vatican?
[3:40:29.040 --> 3:40:33.040]  Why is this guy, who is a promoter for a socialist,
[3:40:33.040 --> 3:40:37.040]  out and out socialist, Bernie Sanders, what's he doing advising the Pope?
[3:40:37.040 --> 3:40:40.040]  Why does he have entree to the Vatican, friends?
[3:40:40.040 --> 3:40:45.040]  Sachs supports abortion and contraception, but that's not a problem for the Vatican.
[3:40:45.040 --> 3:40:49.040]  For the Vatican, for Pope Francis and for his friends at the U.N.,
[3:40:49.040 --> 3:40:53.040]  Donald Trump is the problem, obviously, friends.
[3:40:53.040 --> 3:41:00.040]  Clearly, I consider the Trump administration a danger to the world,
[3:41:00.040 --> 3:41:08.040]  but I regard it as a purely temporary phenomenon that will disappear in 2020.
[3:41:08.040 --> 3:41:10.040]  Did you get it?
[3:41:10.040 --> 3:41:13.040]  Do you see why there's so much hate for Trump?
[3:41:13.040 --> 3:41:16.040]  Because with all of his faults, again, he's the capitalist.
[3:41:16.040 --> 3:41:17.040]  He's not the globalist.
[3:41:17.040 --> 3:41:19.040]  There never will be one of them.
[3:41:19.040 --> 3:41:23.040]  Which is why he pulled the United States out of the Paris Climate Agreement.
[3:41:23.040 --> 3:41:27.040]  Donald Trump pulled the United States out of the World Health Organization.
[3:41:27.040 --> 3:41:29.040]  That's Bill Gates and company.
[3:41:29.040 --> 3:41:32.040]  And now he's threatening to pull the United States out of the World Trade Organization.
[3:41:32.040 --> 3:41:35.040]  People say, yeah, well, Donald Trump got married twice.
[3:41:35.040 --> 3:41:37.040]  He's a bad guy, really?
[3:41:37.040 --> 3:41:40.040]  He's right in the face of the demons on this, friends.
[3:41:40.040 --> 3:41:42.040]  Nobody ever said he was a saint.
[3:41:42.040 --> 3:41:47.040]  He's knocking the sacred cows of the United Nations down all over the world right now.
[3:41:47.040 --> 3:41:53.040]  The General Assembly routinely votes 185 against the United States
[3:41:53.040 --> 3:41:56.040]  on almost everything right now.
[3:41:56.040 --> 3:41:59.040]  And you remember, speaking of the United Nations,
[3:41:59.040 --> 3:42:03.040]  in November of 2019, again, right before COVID landed,
[3:42:03.040 --> 3:42:08.040]  Donald Trump went to the UN on the floor of the General Assembly
[3:42:08.040 --> 3:42:11.040]  and he declared war on globalism.
[3:42:11.040 --> 3:42:16.040]  Wise leaders always put the good of their own people
[3:42:16.040 --> 3:42:19.040]  and their own country first.
[3:42:19.040 --> 3:42:23.040]  The future does not belong to globalists.
[3:42:23.040 --> 3:42:26.040]  The future belongs to patriots.
[3:42:26.040 --> 3:42:28.040]  And shortly after the speech at the UN,
[3:42:28.040 --> 3:42:30.040]  Donald Trump delivered,
[3:42:30.040 --> 3:42:33.040]  and everything happened.
[3:42:33.040 --> 3:42:36.040]  The coronavirus was unleashed on the world
[3:42:36.040 --> 3:42:40.040]  and Trump's booming U.S. economy went on life support.
[3:42:40.040 --> 3:42:45.040]  Do you think that was an accident?
[3:42:45.040 --> 3:42:50.040]  So when they tell you, when they tell all of us to stay home,
[3:42:50.040 --> 3:42:53.040]  wear your mask so grandma doesn't get sick,
[3:42:53.040 --> 3:42:55.040]  please understand what's really going on here,
[3:42:55.040 --> 3:42:58.040]  they don't care about your grandmother.
[3:42:58.040 --> 3:43:00.040]  They don't care about old people, these people.
[3:43:00.040 --> 3:43:02.040]  They don't care about babies.
[3:43:02.040 --> 3:43:06.040]  They want them aborted so that they can save the common home.
[3:43:06.040 --> 3:43:08.040]  Abort babies, millions of them all over the world.
[3:43:08.040 --> 3:43:09.040]  They don't care about babies.
[3:43:09.040 --> 3:43:10.040]  They don't care about old people.
[3:43:10.040 --> 3:43:12.040]  In fact, if you want to save your grandma,
[3:43:12.040 --> 3:43:16.040]  tell the globalists to stay the hell away from her.
[3:43:16.040 --> 3:43:19.040]  You remember how some of them, like Cuomo and characters like this,
[3:43:19.040 --> 3:43:22.040]  were running COVID recovering patients through nursing homes?
[3:43:22.040 --> 3:43:25.040]  That's how much they care about grandma.
[3:43:25.040 --> 3:43:28.040]  The name of the game now is to bring the United States economy
[3:43:28.040 --> 3:43:31.040]  to its knees, get it out of the way,
[3:43:31.040 --> 3:43:33.040]  so that everyone will want the great reset.
[3:43:33.040 --> 3:43:36.040]  Make the new normal so intolerably abnormal
[3:43:36.040 --> 3:43:39.040]  that even you and I maybe, you know,
[3:43:39.040 --> 3:43:40.040]  at some point in the near future,
[3:43:40.040 --> 3:43:42.040]  will be begging for the vaccines
[3:43:42.040 --> 3:43:44.040]  because we'll be driven crazy by that point.
[3:43:44.040 --> 3:43:47.040]  Begging for whatever else is going to keep us safe
[3:43:47.040 --> 3:43:50.040]  according to our jailers and our handlers
[3:43:50.040 --> 3:43:52.040]  and our zookeepers, you see?
[3:43:52.040 --> 3:43:53.040]  That's what they want.
[3:43:53.040 --> 3:43:55.040]  That's why they keep using this term new normal.
[3:43:55.040 --> 3:43:57.040]  You know what we do to fight back?
[3:43:57.040 --> 3:43:59.040]  Go to work.
[3:43:59.040 --> 3:44:00.040]  Go back to school.
[3:44:00.040 --> 3:44:02.040]  If you're healthy, take off the mask.
[3:44:02.040 --> 3:44:05.040]  And for heaven's sake, go back to church
[3:44:05.040 --> 3:44:08.040]  and pray that Trump wins in November.
[3:44:08.040 --> 3:44:10.040]  That's what the reset was on.
[3:44:10.040 --> 3:44:12.040]  That's what the Russia hoax was all about.
[3:44:12.040 --> 3:44:16.040]  That's what the impeachment hoax was all about, don't you see?
[3:44:16.040 --> 3:44:18.040]  For four years, they've been trying to stop this man
[3:44:18.040 --> 3:44:20.040]  because if he strengthens America,
[3:44:20.040 --> 3:44:21.040]  if he makes it great again,
[3:44:21.040 --> 3:44:24.040]  if he brings the economy back again,
[3:44:24.040 --> 3:44:26.040]  the reset won't happen.
[3:44:26.040 --> 3:44:28.040]  The New World Order is going to be set way back.
[3:44:28.040 --> 3:44:31.040]  Who knows when they're going to have another COVID opportunity
[3:44:31.040 --> 3:44:34.040]  like this one again, and they know it.
[3:44:34.040 --> 3:44:36.040]  So I ask yourselves why they hate this man.
[3:44:36.040 --> 3:44:39.040]  These folks, these men, they hate God.
[3:44:39.040 --> 3:44:41.040]  They hate the unborn.
[3:44:41.040 --> 3:44:44.040]  They hate the traditional family.
[3:44:44.040 --> 3:44:46.040]  They hate you.
[3:44:46.040 --> 3:44:48.040]  And they hate Donald Trump.
[3:44:48.040 --> 3:44:52.040]  Political opponents, by the way, right now are knocking statues of saints to the ground.
[3:44:52.040 --> 3:44:54.040]  They're beating up cops.
[3:44:54.040 --> 3:44:57.040]  And they're burning flags.
[3:44:57.040 --> 3:44:59.040]  You say you don't like Trump.
[3:44:59.040 --> 3:45:01.040]  I'm sorry, friends, but who cares?
[3:45:01.040 --> 3:45:03.040]  That doesn't really matter anymore.
[3:45:03.040 --> 3:45:06.040]  But you think of Trump's personalities, tweets.
[3:45:06.040 --> 3:45:11.040]  Look at the big picture. The choice is simple, friends.
[3:45:11.040 --> 3:45:15.040]  Stand with America right now.
[3:45:15.040 --> 3:45:17.040]  Or fall with the New World Order.
[3:45:17.040 --> 3:45:19.040]  That's right. The full video is at infowars.com.
[3:45:19.040 --> 3:45:21.040]  A great reset.
[3:45:21.040 --> 3:45:50.040]  Warren coming up. Great job, crew.
