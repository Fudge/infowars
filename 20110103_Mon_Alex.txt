[00:00.000 --> 00:11.560]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well
[00:11.560 --> 00:19.120]  so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin
[00:19.120 --> 00:31.120]  Texas Alex Jones thank you for joining us today my friends it is the first live
[00:31.120 --> 00:38.240]  weekday show second live broadcast of the new year 2011 we're going to be live
[00:38.240 --> 00:46.280]  here for the next three hours and joining us via video audio link from Canada
[00:46.280 --> 00:50.000]  we're going to be talking to a gentleman about the breakdown of society the
[00:50.000 --> 00:56.240]  hive mind how the globalist are literally farming the population in this
[00:56.240 --> 01:01.640]  modern predatory system and I'm simply declaring in the new year that I am not
[01:01.640 --> 01:07.700]  cattle I am not owned by the globalist I am not their property I am not an animal
[01:07.700 --> 01:12.080]  they do not have a right to feed on me notice the globalist have all these
[01:12.080 --> 01:16.720]  rules for us and then exempt themselves from all the rules that they place on us
[01:16.720 --> 01:20.960]  they tell us we don't have free will or we don't control our own destiny but
[01:20.960 --> 01:24.920]  then meanwhile they're obsessed with their free will and controlling their
[01:24.920 --> 01:29.160]  destiny and they don't want us involved in any decisions that are made on this
[01:29.160 --> 01:33.800]  planet because they're building the planet in their nightmare image and in
[01:33.800 --> 01:39.720]  that image in that system in that world that we're entering into we're not part
[01:39.720 --> 01:44.400]  of it we are to be removed destroyed and if you ignore the legions of
[01:44.400 --> 01:48.720]  admissions and blueprints and white papers by the controllers where they
[01:48.720 --> 01:54.600]  admit all this you do so at your own peril so we'll tell you more about the
[01:54.600 --> 02:00.760]  special guest joining us coming up the next segment I walked into the office
[02:00.760 --> 02:08.400]  yesterday and Matt Ryan was saying look at these stories on drudge about birds
[02:08.400 --> 02:14.440]  falling out of the sky and he started mentioning how this had happened in
[02:14.440 --> 02:18.360]  Austin last year thousands and thousands of sparrows and other birds died
[02:18.360 --> 02:24.400]  and I made the point well they died over time in a few week period but when you
[02:24.400 --> 02:28.520]  see something like what happened in Arkansas it's very suspicious and in
[02:28.520 --> 02:32.680]  the past it's been proven that it's been associated with chemical biological
[02:32.680 --> 02:38.920]  radiological tests that have been done but there's not just chemical biological
[02:38.920 --> 02:43.720]  or classic radiological tests there's also wave tests which I guess are a
[02:43.720 --> 02:49.440]  form of radiation different scalar technologies harp systems really their
[02:49.440 --> 02:55.920]  route goes back to one of the greatest minds in history of course and Mr.
[02:55.920 --> 03:01.760]  Tesla there's also been a big fish die-off nearby and this happened on
[03:01.760 --> 03:08.280]  New Year's Day and sort of getting attention yesterday on Sunday into today
[03:08.280 --> 03:14.560]  is mass bird and fish die-off connected to government testing that is the
[03:14.560 --> 03:18.680]  question and Paul Watson and I threw together this article quickly this
[03:18.680 --> 03:24.320]  morning I've got Watson adding some more links to more modern admissions of
[03:24.320 --> 03:27.000]  secret chemical biological and radiological testing that's been
[03:27.000 --> 03:30.840]  declassified or leaked because it's important to really show people a wide
[03:30.840 --> 03:37.560]  spectrum of examples of it blackbirds ducks other birds fell out of the sky in
[03:37.560 --> 03:43.040]  a one-mile area there was no hail there was no lightning because witnesses were
[03:43.040 --> 03:49.160]  up because it was the new year and I know in Arkansas and Oklahoma particularly
[03:49.160 --> 03:52.720]  and I was trying to dig it up this morning for some reason I couldn't find
[03:52.720 --> 03:56.520]  it because it's about nine years old and it's you have to remember the exact
[03:56.520 --> 03:59.880]  headline or you can't find it but remember nine years ago it was in the
[03:59.880 --> 04:05.440]  daily Oklahoma and a bunch of other papers quote biological threat testing
[04:05.440 --> 04:10.720]  was was part of the headline and they had sessions another aircraft quote
[04:10.720 --> 04:15.520]  spraying biological weapons simulants all over the state and then it turned out
[04:15.520 --> 04:20.640]  it wasn't a simulant it was subtilis globigy and one other bacteria directly
[04:20.640 --> 04:26.520]  in the literature linked to abortions in all mammal species from rats up to
[04:26.520 --> 04:35.560]  horses dogs humans you name it and well we're going to read over Watson's
[04:35.560 --> 04:40.440]  article when we come back then we're going to get into what's happening in
[04:40.440 --> 04:44.120]  the new year all of the draconian legislation they're trying to now
[04:44.120 --> 04:50.520]  enforce painter's promise to try to repeal government takeover of health
[04:50.520 --> 04:58.160]  care in their first two weeks in the new legislative session it's all coming up

[08:01.640 --> 08:07.400]  radio network proudly presents the Alex Jones show because there's a war on for
[08:07.400 --> 08:09.800]  your mind
[08:09.800 --> 08:21.600]  it is Monday the third day of January 2011 we're gonna be live here for the
[08:21.600 --> 08:29.360]  next three hours today you know I spend a lot of time covering and discussing
[08:29.360 --> 08:37.160]  secret chemical biological radiological test that are done on the
[08:37.160 --> 08:43.960]  American people because there are tens of thousands of declassified individual
[08:43.960 --> 08:49.840]  instances thousands of declassified programs and we know that that is only
[08:49.840 --> 08:55.360]  a small thumbnail sketch of what's really going on the globalist see
[08:55.360 --> 08:59.720]  themselves that's why it's important to know history the globalist the social
[08:59.720 --> 09:04.640]  engineers see themselves as societal engineers but more importantly as
[09:04.640 --> 09:10.160]  scientists and they see this as a scientific control grid that they've
[09:10.160 --> 09:15.320]  set up so they need data they need to test and while they're gathering data
[09:15.320 --> 09:19.720]  they're also training cadres of scientists and technicians that will
[09:19.720 --> 09:24.320]  put a small child in a chamber and radiate them to death that will march
[09:24.320 --> 09:30.120]  us army soldiers into a chamber and nerve gas them all declassified that will
[09:30.120 --> 09:34.360]  spray bio weapons in the New York subway that will spray bio weapons in the
[09:34.360 --> 09:39.200]  San Francisco ship channel that will spray bio weapons on white rock New
[09:39.200 --> 09:45.360]  Mexico that will spray bio weapons on Oklahoma City thousands and thousands
[09:45.360 --> 09:49.600]  and thousands and thousands of programs tens of thousands of individual
[09:49.600 --> 09:55.360]  instances and when you bring this to someone who's under mind control that
[09:55.360 --> 09:59.040]  is the general public because there's not just chemical biological radiological
[09:59.040 --> 10:03.640]  testing there's also societal psychological confusion warfare through the
[10:03.640 --> 10:09.760]  television the reduction of the language the chemicals and biologicals that are
[10:09.760 --> 10:14.560]  added things like fluoride that's an adjuvant an accelerant and all the other
[10:14.560 --> 10:22.440]  trace chemicals they're adding this is a giant mind control grid and it's all
[10:22.440 --> 10:27.160]  about compartmentalization need to know and it's all about keeping the public
[10:27.160 --> 10:31.200]  in the dark on the giant eugenics program while they test the soft kills
[10:31.200 --> 10:35.240]  while they train the public to prepare for mega death while they train the
[10:35.240 --> 10:42.080]  public to prepare for mass culling and a future without humanity notice how the
[10:42.080 --> 10:45.680]  romanticizing that everywhere they're getting you ready your subconscious mind
[10:45.680 --> 10:50.680]  to accept it so you don't resist during the first accelerated phases of the next
[10:50.680 --> 10:56.400]  level of this now the big trump card we've got is we're aware of the program
[10:56.400 --> 11:01.760]  we're aware of the enemy's operations they think that because it's so horrific
[11:01.760 --> 11:05.760]  despite the fact is publicly available information that the average person will
[11:05.760 --> 11:11.280]  be so subconsciously horrified that they will engage in crime stop or double
[11:11.280 --> 11:17.600]  think and convince themselves it's not real and I believe in you plus I know
[11:17.600 --> 11:21.360]  it's not going to even take a majority of people to beat these globalist it's
[11:21.360 --> 11:24.720]  going to take folks that are willing to understand it and face what we're dealing
[11:24.720 --> 11:33.120]  with now that said today is mass bird and fish die off connected to government
[11:33.120 --> 11:38.080]  testing and we see these reports all the time the first thing you need to
[11:38.080 --> 11:45.440]  understand is they've done studies with these no stick stove tops and when you
[11:45.440 --> 11:49.760]  first heat them up they off gas and it will kill most species of bird because
[11:49.760 --> 11:56.200]  very small trace amounts of toxic gases will kill a bird because of their whole
[11:56.200 --> 12:03.080]  metabolic system and their constitution that will not kill a polar bear or a rat
[12:03.080 --> 12:11.280]  or a monkey or a homo sapien sapien that's why they have canaries in coal mines
[12:11.280 --> 12:17.400]  and this entire weekend it was chemtrail central the entire sky was sprayed
[12:17.400 --> 12:22.600]  from end to end they then expanded it blocked a wet weather front from coming
[12:22.600 --> 12:26.400]  in to central Texas and stopped us from getting the rain we needed the planes
[12:26.400 --> 12:33.040]  always show up ahead of a front and remember we have a literally it's got
[12:33.040 --> 12:37.720]  to be more than 50 patents and I've got to stop the obsession with research and
[12:37.720 --> 12:44.480]  go ahead and put out the eugenics film I mean chemtrails are 100% confirmed how
[12:44.480 --> 12:50.240]  they do it how they load it how it all works it's compartmentalized over a
[12:50.240 --> 12:54.600]  decade ago knowing their their their program of compartmentalization need to
[12:54.600 --> 12:58.320]  know I knew it had to be mixed with a jet fuel that way the airlines don't even
[12:58.320 --> 13:02.720]  really know except for the executive level the pilots don't know it's not
[13:02.720 --> 13:06.000]  special aircraft doing this though the military now admits they do have some
[13:06.000 --> 13:09.840]  special aircraft the Department of Energy has some as well there's been a
[13:09.840 --> 13:15.200]  giant at least 18-year secret weather modification program going on to alter
[13:15.200 --> 13:18.840]  Earth's atmosphere because we've been exposing it now John P. Holder in the
[13:18.840 --> 13:22.360]  White House science are has begun to come out with some of this because it was
[13:22.360 --> 13:26.320]  hurting them too bad to just flatly deny it all so I mean while the average
[13:26.320 --> 13:30.480]  person sitting around talking about how sports only matter or how their 401k
[13:30.480 --> 13:34.880]  matters and nothing else we're living on a planet where a eugenics mass
[13:34.880 --> 13:39.520]  murdering elite openly are modifying the atmosphere they've got hundreds of
[13:39.520 --> 13:44.320]  secret torture sites all over the world mind control facilities at camp x-ray on
[13:44.320 --> 13:50.360]  record where they're manufacturing muslim terrorist that's why they grab up
[13:50.360 --> 13:53.960]  14-year-old kids off the battlefield and take them there for five years then
[13:53.960 --> 13:57.880]  release them to be to be al-qaeda commanders and then they're untouchable
[13:57.880 --> 14:03.160]  it's the same thing on Amor al-Alaqi but again it's hidden in plain view that
[14:03.160 --> 14:06.240]  he hangs out secretly at the Pentagon getting orders even comes out in Fox
[14:06.240 --> 14:10.160]  News nobody gets in trouble the average Fox News viewer just doesn't even
[14:10.160 --> 14:15.120]  register it when they hear it just like the the massive weather modification
[14:15.120 --> 14:21.040]  program but that's only a subset we know about declassified chemical
[14:21.040 --> 14:27.960]  radiological biological testing including lethal testing going on at an
[14:27.960 --> 14:34.040]  accelerated rate from the 1920s through to today people who say they couldn't get
[14:34.040 --> 14:37.400]  away with this they haven't it's most of its public people who say they couldn't
[14:37.400 --> 14:42.440]  get away with a 9-11 it wasn't declassified until the 1980s in 1987 when
[14:42.440 --> 14:46.960]  the program started upwards of half a million women on record sterilized in
[14:46.960 --> 14:52.200]  the United States secretly babies murdered at birth because they had poor
[14:52.200 --> 14:58.280]  mothers that's now been declassified but before it was ever declassified they
[14:58.280 --> 15:03.400]  had newsreels promoting the murder of babies at birth and we have clips of
[15:03.400 --> 15:11.000]  that in English from the United States in 1930 in my film in-game blueprint for
[15:11.000 --> 15:17.320]  global enslavement the simulated murder of an of a newborn baby and how good it
[15:17.320 --> 15:23.520]  is that that they were showing people that that's why Hitler was loved in
[15:23.520 --> 15:29.800]  America he because he praised America he praised Margaret Singer he praised all
[15:29.800 --> 15:34.800]  the eugenics he praised the Rockefellers he was the savior but we're
[15:34.800 --> 15:38.720]  supposed to forget that my grandfather told me about growing up in Dallas and
[15:38.720 --> 15:44.720]  all the time on the radio mainline they played Hitler speeches and and translated
[15:44.720 --> 15:52.760]  it said how great Hitler was right up in Dallas on Dallas radio stations you're
[15:52.760 --> 15:57.040]  supposed to forget all that Hitler is a creation of the New World Order not the
[15:57.040 --> 16:04.120]  other way around he's only one arm one little arm of this system so to get into
[16:04.120 --> 16:11.040]  the birds dying clearly when you have some reports are five four two thousand
[16:11.040 --> 16:16.560]  birds including ducks falling out of the sky in first a one mile than a two mile
[16:16.560 --> 16:23.640]  area something's going on fish die-offs nearby as well these have always been
[16:23.640 --> 16:28.600]  associated with chemical and biological testing it may only hurt a big old
[16:28.600 --> 16:33.240]  hundred and fifty pound two hundred pound human but a bird gets a whiff of it
[16:33.240 --> 16:37.520]  they're gonna die let's go ahead and play part of this newscast just before
[16:37.520 --> 16:42.480]  folks in BB rang in the new year many witnessed an uncanny resemblance to the
[16:42.480 --> 16:47.320]  Hitchcock movie the birds two thousand blackbirds fell from the sky off
[16:47.320 --> 16:51.640]  Windwood Drive covering about a mile leaving quite the mass to clean up
[16:51.640 --> 16:55.760]  THV's Katharina Yancey has the details it on our top story from the
[16:55.760 --> 17:00.320]  information center Katharina Ashley folks I spoke with initially thought the
[17:00.320 --> 17:03.960]  birds were poisoned because they are what they call a nuisance around this
[17:03.960 --> 17:10.040]  time every year but they are surprised to hear it's more of a mystery millions
[17:10.040 --> 17:15.520]  millions every night you look up at the sky it's just black so and then last night
[17:15.520 --> 17:20.680]  about 10 30 I come out here and I've seen a bird drop in a matter of hours on
[17:20.680 --> 17:25.240]  New Year's Eve thousands of birds fell from the sky to their death and I just
[17:25.240 --> 17:29.000]  immediately called mom because I had to go to work and I said you've got to come
[17:29.000 --> 17:32.320]  get the kids and get the dog cuz I don't know what's going on but I don't
[17:32.320 --> 17:36.160]  want to mess in with any of them it was horrible you could not even get down the
[17:36.160 --> 17:42.840]  road without running over hundreds it was that bad the mystery is unraveling
[17:42.840 --> 17:47.680]  like scenes from a movie dozens of US environmental service crews spent the
[17:47.680 --> 17:52.440]  day picking up the birds walking between homes and climbing on people's roofs
[17:52.440 --> 17:57.440]  with protective hazmat suits okay breathing masks nobody knows it made
[17:57.440 --> 18:04.800]  national news back in 1997 when hundreds of witnesses including police and
[18:04.800 --> 18:09.880]  others that we interviewed on air in Belton Texas north of where I sit saw
[18:09.880 --> 18:17.480]  helicopters with spray canisters flying over the small town and neighborhoods
[18:17.480 --> 18:23.560]  and people got violently ill and it ended up being a national news story they
[18:23.560 --> 18:27.760]  do this stuff right out in the open to test the troops to test the pilots to
[18:27.760 --> 18:33.000]  test the media to see what they can get away with and now they've set the
[18:33.000 --> 18:37.600]  precedent to just do this stuff right out in the open and when it comes out
[18:37.600 --> 18:41.840]  that oh yeah up into the 1990s they were nerve-gassing our troops to death oh
[18:41.840 --> 18:46.880]  yeah and you know in 2003 they were taking foster kids and testing
[18:46.880 --> 18:54.120]  chemicals on them and even killing some of them in New York State so what and it
[18:54.120 --> 19:03.920]  sets the precedent and I have sat here with mainstream news in my office
[19:03.920 --> 19:08.440]  bringing up chemical biological radiological secret testing and the
[19:08.440 --> 19:19.000]  talk show host the the news presenters the nightline people MSNBC they look at
[19:19.000 --> 19:22.720]  you like you're crazy so I hand them mainstream news articles about it and
[19:22.720 --> 19:30.360]  they still laugh at you see they can't face it they say I'm crazy even though I
[19:30.360 --> 19:35.920]  have all the admissions because if they ever admitted up to this they'd have to
[19:35.920 --> 19:41.600]  do something about it but because they subconsciously feel powerless against
[19:41.600 --> 19:47.880]  the government they go ahead and deny it or they make excuses for it oh those
[19:47.880 --> 19:51.960]  are isolated incidents so those were just rogue scientists really why don't
[19:51.960 --> 19:55.400]  they ever go to prison why do they get promotions for it I'm gonna come back
[19:55.400 --> 20:01.280]  go over Paul Watson and the story I did with him stay with us one of the most
[20:01.280 --> 20:05.080]  potent ways to lower blood pressure is to inhibit the angiotensin converting
[20:05.080 --> 20:09.160]  enzyme in the body also called ace in nature there are a group of proteins
[20:09.160 --> 20:13.120]  found in unheated way that inhibit the ace enzyme the most potent ace
[20:13.120 --> 20:16.960]  inhibitor to date is lacto-kinin while lacto-kinin does not have the
[20:16.960 --> 20:20.720]  inhibitory potency of synthetic drugs commonly used in the treatment of
[20:20.720 --> 20:25.000]  hypertension this naturally occurring whey peptide may be able to help keep

[23:01.640 --> 23:06.800]  you feel I'm Don from the Mexican January of 2000 I had a heart attack then
[23:06.800 --> 23:11.160]  my real health began going downhill and I had high blood pressure high blood
[23:11.160 --> 23:15.480]  sugar poor vision and I really wasn't sleeping well I was a mess pretty much
[23:15.480 --> 23:18.880]  Don reports dramatic improvements with heart and body extract I started
[23:18.880 --> 23:23.200]  taking heart and body extract and within a few days I started sleeping a lot
[23:23.200 --> 23:28.080]  better my blood pressure normalized my blood sugar normalized and my sleep
[23:28.080 --> 23:31.320]  really did improve experience these benefits and more when your body gets
[23:31.320 --> 23:34.840]  what it needs with the assistance of heart and body extract order at HB
[23:34.840 --> 23:45.560]  extract.com or call 866 295 5305 that's HB extract.com or call 866 295 5305 folks I
[23:45.560 --> 23:49.120]  did not expect this at all about a 7th 8th and 9th day I saw dramatic
[23:49.120 --> 23:53.680]  improvements from taking heart and body extract details at HB extract.com or
[23:53.680 --> 24:10.800]  call 866 295 5305 or heart and body extract.
[24:23.680 --> 24:33.840]  I know I spend a lot of time on chemical biological radiological secret testing
[24:33.840 --> 24:39.080]  but when you know that the government from the highest levels has been giving
[24:39.080 --> 24:43.960]  the orders at least since the 20s to secretly murder people in the name of
[24:43.960 --> 24:48.720]  science it tells you everything you need to know about these people and then
[24:48.720 --> 24:52.640]  nothing that they say or do matters anymore because you understand that
[24:52.640 --> 24:57.520]  presidents come and go but this scientific dictatorship continues and
[24:57.520 --> 25:04.840]  then you find out by discovering history you are empowered you find out it's the
[25:04.840 --> 25:10.240]  Rockefeller family more than anybody but also the British royalty and others who
[25:10.240 --> 25:16.200]  on record funded the modern sciences from a eugenics perspective of how to
[25:16.200 --> 25:20.680]  dominate and control populations and how to give life extension technologies to
[25:20.680 --> 25:27.200]  their own families it was Rockefeller grants in a quest for 30 years that
[25:27.200 --> 25:33.400]  discovered DNA and the double helix Watson the main discoverer of it is on
[25:33.400 --> 25:41.200]  record saying blacks aren't human and being a big Nazi and the media always
[25:41.200 --> 25:45.400]  knew this they could read his books that's why I put out in game three and a
[25:45.400 --> 25:49.600]  half years ago calling out Watson and then about a year after the film came
[25:49.600 --> 25:53.920]  out he made statements about blacks being basically stupid and and and not
[25:53.920 --> 25:59.040]  being fully homo sapiens sapien and he had to resign from cold springs harbor
[25:59.040 --> 26:04.560]  human genome project what's cold springs harbor that's the Rockefeller
[26:04.560 --> 26:11.440]  Institute on eugenics and the German office was the Kaiserville Helm branch
[26:11.440 --> 26:21.240]  and so I see a news story about a bunch of birds mysteriously dying falling out
[26:21.240 --> 26:25.920]  of the sky and I know about the past reports of this remember the other
[26:25.920 --> 26:31.000]  reports about a green goo falling out of the sky and all the rest of it and
[26:31.000 --> 26:34.960]  birds dying all over the country and we know there's all this bizarre weather
[26:34.960 --> 26:38.480]  modification going on they're also testing all these different microwaves and
[26:38.480 --> 26:47.800]  things is mass bird and fish die off connected to government testing 1977
[26:47.800 --> 26:51.280]  Senate hearing found that US government had infected hundreds of cities with
[26:51.280 --> 26:57.880]  biological agents but they tell you that the TSA needs to put their hands down
[26:57.880 --> 27:03.960]  your pants and now scan your credit cards and copy them and confiscate your
[27:03.960 --> 27:09.360]  Christmas calendar because it's to keep you safe from al-qaeda but the
[27:09.360 --> 27:15.440]  government's been spraying the public for a long time oh but again that's to
[27:15.440 --> 27:20.960]  protect us to a mass die off of birds and fish in Arkansas which prompted a
[27:20.960 --> 27:26.200]  response by US environmental services has residents asking questions about the
[27:26.200 --> 27:30.760]  cause could secret government testing be responsible for the carnage you know
[27:30.760 --> 27:34.920]  what I find interesting and we need to get callers from BB and other areas where
[27:34.920 --> 27:37.880]  similar things happened not just in that town we're getting reports from other
[27:37.880 --> 27:44.200]  towns were there already a big influx of people in the town the night before did
[27:44.200 --> 27:48.480]  you see government trucks with their hazmat suits in the front seat Oklahoma
[27:48.480 --> 27:54.480]  City 9-11 first World Trade Center attack 93 they always have a drill right
[27:54.480 --> 28:03.280]  before what did the deputy had a FEMA mr. Kennedy tell ABC News on 9-11 oh it's
[28:03.280 --> 28:06.440]  a good thing we got here on September 10th and we're already ready and had
[28:06.440 --> 28:10.280]  moved things out to the front of the pier in the command center and then the
[28:10.280 --> 28:12.840]  media was like what are you talking about so a day later they said oh that
[28:12.840 --> 28:19.560]  was a mistake FEMA wasn't there a day before forget what he said remember that
[28:19.560 --> 28:26.520]  remember that and and then it got declassified a few years later oh you
[28:26.520 --> 28:37.200]  bet it's true it all happened FEMA was running a drill called tripod to a drill
[28:37.200 --> 28:41.600]  where they had moved out the day before into command centers simulating an
[28:41.600 --> 28:45.720]  attack on the World Trade Centers the way you'll know this is a staged event
[28:45.720 --> 28:53.080]  for sure is if the hazmat teams or advanced teams were already there on
[28:53.080 --> 29:01.520]  New Year's Eve because if you look at the declassified 1966 bio weapons spring
[29:01.520 --> 29:05.360]  in the New York subway just the parts that are declassified I didn't declassify
[29:05.360 --> 29:10.640]  at all they had hundreds of army doctors posing in nearby hospitals as
[29:10.640 --> 29:15.640]  regular doctors at emergency rooms to get samples when the people they'd hit
[29:15.640 --> 29:22.280]  with the bio weapon came in so they'll have their people in place for one of
[29:22.280 --> 29:26.280]  these tests to see what it does to the humans and again there's other groups
[29:26.280 --> 29:30.680]  testing will the media figure out what's happening what will the locals do it's
[29:30.680 --> 29:35.200]  all gauging what they can introduce into the environment what they can spray us
[29:35.200 --> 29:38.560]  with I mean remember last year we were getting the reports and then it was
[29:38.560 --> 29:44.080]  confirmed that they were shooting up little kids elementary school with the
[29:44.080 --> 29:47.760]  flu shot without their parents authorization kind of like Pennsylvania
[29:47.760 --> 29:53.320]  watching you over the laptops at home we're on the March the Empire's on the
[29:53.320 --> 30:02.000]  run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network this is Alex Jones with five good
[30:02.000 --> 30:06.000]  reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator number one new
[30:06.000 --> 30:09.800]  climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill number two
[30:09.800 --> 30:13.880]  our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company
[30:13.880 --> 30:18.120]  allows you to have it's true total government control of electricity in the
[30:18.120 --> 30:22.400]  name of smart grid technology is coming number three in some areas of the
[30:22.400 --> 30:26.400]  country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist
[30:26.400 --> 30:30.760]  legislation is only compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is
[30:30.760 --> 30:34.480]  always a threat to local grids every year thousands of families lose their
[30:34.480 --> 30:38.640]  power from weather related onages number five a solar power generator provides
[30:38.640 --> 30:42.440]  powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks I really believe in the solar
[30:42.440 --> 30:46.320]  power generators offered by solution from science one of my oldest sponsors you
[30:46.320 --> 30:51.120]  can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com that's my solar

[31:02.920 --> 31:06.440]  lungs generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced
[31:06.440 --> 31:10.360]  colloidal silver solutions yet many are unaware of the entire function of the
[31:10.360 --> 31:13.920]  silver lung system and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions

[32:57.920 --> 33:04.360]  sampler thank you crashing through the lies and
[33:04.360 --> 33:12.440]  disinformation it's alex jones on the GCN radio network
[33:15.160 --> 33:18.920]  all right getting back to this article and then I'm gonna shift gears into other
[33:18.920 --> 33:24.040]  news I think we should make this the number one search term today dealing
[33:24.040 --> 33:29.480]  with the mass bird die-off because where there's smoke there's fire there's no
[33:29.480 --> 33:35.160]  way this was hail which no one reported hail lightning no you have small birds
[33:35.160 --> 33:40.840]  large birds being killed and so many times it is associated with chemical
[33:40.840 --> 33:46.560]  biological radiological testing and almost all the time they don't tell you
[33:46.560 --> 33:51.120]  for years out in California they'd be trying to eradicate different types of
[33:51.120 --> 33:56.080]  beetles and moths and because these chemicals are known as toxic to humans
[33:56.080 --> 34:01.160]  the state just kept it secret until people did for your request and we're
[34:01.160 --> 34:08.480]  actually able to dig all of this information up and then the population
[34:08.480 --> 34:13.320]  did discover that indeed that had been going on so the attitude is out of
[34:13.320 --> 34:17.440]  sight out of mind just don't tell the public about what's happening I mean
[34:17.440 --> 34:19.760]  there's no telling what this could have been could have been some type of
[34:19.760 --> 34:23.400]  magnetic system being tested but I'm gonna continue along this line that we're
[34:23.400 --> 34:30.120]  gonna get into other news here is mass bird and fish die-off connected to
[34:30.120 --> 34:36.920]  government testing 1977 Senate hearing found that US government had infected
[34:36.920 --> 34:42.840]  hundreds of cities with biological agents a mass die-off of birds and fish in
[34:42.840 --> 34:48.000]  Arkansas which prompted a response by US environmental services has residents
[34:48.000 --> 34:52.360]  asking questions about the case could secret government testing be responsible
[34:52.360 --> 35:00.080]  for the carnage well I mean let's go back just in the last year with Obama on
[35:00.080 --> 35:05.560]  television and the EPA saying core exit is not bad for you and that no one was
[35:05.560 --> 35:12.200]  ill cleaning it up in the Gulf cleaning up the oil just like the government told
[35:12.200 --> 35:16.480]  the firefighters police and emergency workers hey there's no problem with this
[35:16.480 --> 35:21.120]  asbestos dust you don't have to wear a respirator when they knew full well and
[35:21.120 --> 35:25.760]  later came out day one their own reports that it was deadly poison and but you've
[35:25.760 --> 35:29.480]  got to ask the population the police the fireman the medical workers what's
[35:29.480 --> 35:34.000]  wrong with you why have the government's been caught thousands and
[35:34.000 --> 35:38.640]  thousands of times murdering us premeditatedly why do we believe them
[35:38.640 --> 35:43.680]  why do we trust them still I mean I guess we really are prey animals I guess
[35:43.680 --> 35:48.160]  we really are idiots I guess we really do deserve it like Ron Paul said a month
[35:48.160 --> 35:52.520]  or so ago on the show if people put up with the government sticking their hands
[35:52.520 --> 35:58.320]  down our pants if the people put up with this type of abuse if the people go
[35:58.320 --> 36:02.240]  along with this then I guess we do deserve it in a way and that's how the
[36:02.240 --> 36:07.600]  globalists see it if we'll put up with this then we're fair game well I'm here
[36:07.600 --> 36:11.760]  declaring I'm a human being I'm conscious I don't want to be poisoned I
[36:11.760 --> 36:15.720]  don't want stuff in my water I don't want you doing this to me and I'm going to
[36:15.720 --> 36:19.360]  come after you politically and try to bring you to justice I'm giving fight
[36:19.360 --> 36:23.640]  back to you I'm not just acquiescing like I'm a t-bone steak on the table
[36:23.640 --> 36:30.760]  authorizing you to eat me okay I'm not your property continuing here is mass
[36:30.760 --> 36:36.280]  bird and fish die off connected to government testing again some news says
[36:36.280 --> 36:39.840]  4,000 others 2,000 I don't know what the real number is around 2,000 red wing
[36:39.840 --> 36:45.840]  blackbirds as well as ducks fell to their deaths over a mile area of BB
[36:45.840 --> 36:49.880]  Arkansas on Friday night US environmental services workers were
[36:49.880 --> 36:54.640]  hazmat suits and gas masks as they picked up the dead birds an area used
[36:54.640 --> 36:58.840]  by the birds to roost was unaffected leading officials to conclude that the
[36:58.840 --> 37:03.280]  birds could not have died from an illness or have been targeted for
[37:03.280 --> 37:07.920]  poisoning lightning fireworks and high altitude hail have been forwarded as
[37:07.920 --> 37:14.040]  possible culprits but no hail hit the ground I've been in Iraq and back and
[37:14.040 --> 37:19.840]  not seeing like this BB resident Jeff Drennan told local Fox 16 news on Sunday
[37:19.840 --> 37:25.240]  you know my kids are out here playing and you don't know if it's safe he added
[37:25.240 --> 37:29.680]  they're walking around with chemical suits picking them up with gas mask and
[37:29.680 --> 37:33.600]  everything see the government tells you everything's fine but they're wearing
[37:33.600 --> 37:38.840]  hazmat suits in a related story 100,000 fish were found dead in northwest
[37:38.840 --> 37:43.560]  Arkansas they were found along a 20-mile stretch of the Ozark Dam and Highway
[37:43.560 --> 37:49.480]  109 bridge in Franklin County scalar weapons that can artificially manipulate
[37:49.480 --> 37:53.720]  the environment could be responsible for the mass die-offs we know for a fact
[37:53.720 --> 37:58.040]  that over the last decade US military industrial complex was aware and
[37:58.040 --> 38:02.880]  involved in the testing of such technology in 1997 telling the Army
[38:02.880 --> 38:07.720]  Times in the April issue Defense Secretary William Cohen stated other
[38:07.720 --> 38:12.400]  terrorists are engaging even in an eco type of terrorism whereby they can alter
[38:12.400 --> 38:16.880]  the climate set off earthquakes volcanoes remotely through the use of
[38:16.880 --> 38:22.080]  electromagnetic waves so there are plenty of ingenious minds out there that
[38:22.080 --> 38:26.600]  are at work on finding ways in which they can wreak havoc upon other nations
[38:26.600 --> 38:32.920]  it's real still quoting Cohen and that's the reason why we have to intensify
[38:32.920 --> 38:41.080]  our efforts now tectonic weapons volcanic weapons sound weapons and
[38:41.080 --> 38:47.600]  microwave weapons Tesla weapons harp weapons remember four years ago I was
[38:47.600 --> 38:52.880]  contacted by the director of harp out of the blue the director of harp would
[38:52.880 --> 38:58.120]  like to come on your show if I want to contact them again up in Alaska and try
[38:58.120 --> 39:04.280]  to get them back on then the day of the interview comes and John Harmon who
[39:04.280 --> 39:07.440]  runs things up at Genesis says hey there's some military guy on the phone
[39:07.440 --> 39:12.200]  before we can get this as head scientist on the civilian head of the base and he
[39:12.200 --> 39:14.880]  goes all right I will be sitting in during the interview if I don't like
[39:14.880 --> 39:19.120]  what I'm hearing the interview may abruptly end or I may cut the audio off
[39:19.120 --> 39:22.440]  you don't have to talk to me and I said well I wasn't told about this I mean you
[39:22.440 --> 39:26.680]  you guys contacted us well the director would like to come on your show the
[39:26.680 --> 39:32.520]  director likes your show and I said okay whatever so we go on air and only once
[39:32.520 --> 39:36.480]  and luckily it was going to break he cut the guy off and once we went to break he
[39:36.480 --> 39:41.200]  said I don't like where this is going what did the director of it was a colonel
[39:41.200 --> 39:46.440]  what did the director of harp say that made the colonel in the Air Force cut
[39:46.440 --> 39:54.320]  him off he said oh sometimes we ignite the atmosphere on fire at night with
[39:54.320 --> 39:59.840]  harp I mean this is the type of technology they've got and just like
[39:59.840 --> 40:02.400]  they've denied all the weather modification now they're starting to
[40:02.400 --> 40:09.160]  admit a lot of that I know that Ben Livingston it was declassified what
[40:09.160 --> 40:15.560]  seven years ago that Ben Livingston was the father of weather weapons and that
[40:15.560 --> 40:20.160]  he'd flown into typhoons over 200 mile an hour winds after World War two
[40:20.160 --> 40:24.920]  himself the first person to fly into them hurricanes he'd flooded the North
[40:24.920 --> 40:28.920]  Vietnamese out he could make a huge thunderstorm and a flood out of a clear
[40:28.920 --> 40:36.920]  sky in hours with just a few aircraft and he certified for the naval weapons
[40:36.920 --> 40:41.400]  laboratory and Stanford research that they could create control destroy
[40:41.400 --> 40:46.240]  weaken whatever they want hurricanes and he came on my show because it had just
[40:46.240 --> 40:50.440]  been declassified so he could talk about it all I saw him in a middle of
[40:50.440 --> 40:55.560]  newspaper talking about why don't we just knock out these hurricanes we had
[40:55.560 --> 41:00.520]  it certified in 67 that we could do it why would just eight aircraft I could
[41:00.520 --> 41:05.600]  have knocked out that Katrina was right after Katrina and they just
[41:05.600 --> 41:09.480]  declassified a bunch of it so he could talk I called him up got him on the show
[41:09.480 --> 41:14.160]  flew him to Austin but boy after those interviews aired he got some phone calls
[41:14.160 --> 41:18.640]  and said sorry I've gotten calls from people they don't I'm not coming back
[41:18.640 --> 41:25.080]  on your show national security he'd say no to my producer politely and I'd
[41:25.080 --> 41:29.160]  call him up at home come on Mr. Livingston please come back on no I'm
[41:29.160 --> 41:35.480]  not gonna do it not gonna do it and it was right after that time that Kay
[41:35.480 --> 41:40.800]  Bailey Hutchinson came out and said oh we're gonna have a weather modification
[41:40.800 --> 41:47.760]  board a Senate committee to do all of this so I mean the point is there's a
[41:47.760 --> 41:53.440]  lot of stuff going on the public isn't being told and we know that the
[41:53.440 --> 41:59.880]  government has done everything you can imagine to the American people over and
[41:59.880 --> 42:07.640]  over and over and over again and so why do we trust them the whole government
[42:07.640 --> 42:10.440]  should be abolished the whole thing should be removed everything should be
[42:10.440 --> 42:15.920]  declassified get all that pus out of there heal the wound but instead under
[42:15.920 --> 42:20.000]  national security at festers and festers and their homeland security the system
[42:20.000 --> 42:30.000]  is now just gobbling up our entire economy and Watson's article just goes
[42:30.000 --> 42:37.240]  on through many examples of this and he's also added the full length version
[42:37.240 --> 42:43.920]  from YouTube from a director's channel of endgame blueprint for global
[42:43.920 --> 42:48.760]  enslavement in fact I'll show you on air right now the article if you go to
[42:48.760 --> 43:03.000]  prisonplanet.com you can go to the site and the top story is on prisonplanet.com
[43:03.000 --> 43:14.680]  is mass bird and fish die-off connected to government testing and now they
[43:14.680 --> 43:22.760]  brought me another report I went over a similar one earlier dead fish cover 20
[43:22.760 --> 43:29.560]  miles of Arkansas River and of course this is up there where the birds are
[43:29.560 --> 43:35.160]  dying as well state officials on Monday were investigating why 800 or 80,000 to
[43:35.160 --> 43:42.000]  100,000 fish washed up dead on shores the Arkansas River last week but but that
[43:42.000 --> 43:48.440]  could be unrelated because of a oxygen problem or toxicity or some kind of
[43:48.440 --> 43:53.280]  virus but it is suspicious because the bird situation is just very bizarre but
[43:53.280 --> 43:57.240]  if you scroll down on the prisonplanet.com article is mass bird and fish
[43:57.240 --> 44:02.520]  die-off connected to government testing you will see at the bottom of the
[44:02.520 --> 44:11.920]  video endgame blueprint for global enslavement and that film cost me over
[44:11.920 --> 44:20.040]  $100,000 to make it covers only about I don't know 25 or 30 declassified nerve
[44:20.040 --> 44:25.720]  gassing of US troops radiating of US children Israel radiating 110,000 of
[44:25.720 --> 44:31.680]  their children murdering many of them the Nazi experiments but but it covers
[44:31.680 --> 44:35.760]  from the globalist own admissions why and how they're doing it it's almost a
[44:35.760 --> 44:42.840]  three-hour film and I'm begging you to go get the free film at the bottom of
[44:42.840 --> 44:47.400]  this article and to get it out to everybody you know you may know all
[44:47.400 --> 44:50.960]  about this stuff but your friends your family your neighbors don't and we can
[44:50.960 --> 44:56.560]  use a viral story that a lot of people are discussing right now in fact it's
[44:56.560 --> 45:00.360]  been the hottest search term the last two days running as the dead birds we can
[45:00.360 --> 45:05.680]  use a variant of that to get millions of people not just one punch worth
[45:05.680 --> 45:08.680]  throwing doesn't mean it's going to defeat the globalist but resistance is
[45:08.680 --> 45:13.120]  victory if you're listening to this radio show look in the mirror you're the
[45:13.120 --> 45:18.040]  solution you are the resistance and I'd said that for a long time and so had
[45:18.040 --> 45:21.800]  many other leaders in fights against tyranny before they kind of ruined it
[45:21.800 --> 45:27.080]  for us with a t3 or t4 you know this is John Connor if you're listening to my
[45:27.080 --> 45:33.800]  voice you are the resistance now kind of stole our thunder there but if you are
[45:33.800 --> 45:40.240]  listening out there you are the resistance and resistance is victory is
[45:40.240 --> 45:46.280]  mass bird and fish die-off connected to government testing well I haven't done a
[45:46.280 --> 45:49.880]  search term in about three weeks and people been asking me to do them and I
[45:49.880 --> 46:01.040]  can't think of a better one than dealing with eugenics what should we say to link
[46:01.040 --> 46:06.520]  it back to this article is mass bird and fish die-off connected to government
[46:06.520 --> 46:11.840]  testing you guys got any ideas in there I mean what's a search term we can use
[46:11.840 --> 46:15.320]  because I gave Watson the headline Watson wrote most the article I
[46:15.320 --> 46:24.800]  contributed to it yeah but if I say that that's a conclusive and that's not in
[46:24.800 --> 46:36.200]  our headline that is a good headline it just can't be too long is mass bird and
[46:36.200 --> 46:48.640]  fish die-off connected to government testing let me think here a lot of times
[46:48.640 --> 46:51.200]  if I think and just throw one out that becomes the search term I got to be
[46:51.200 --> 46:54.440]  careful and the army of great activists are out there just waiting by their
[46:54.440 --> 47:09.600]  keyboards is mass bird and fish die-off connected to government testing hmm I
[47:09.600 --> 47:16.720]  don't know maybe bird government testing that's three words how's that
[47:16.720 --> 47:24.680]  sound bird government testing let's make bird government testing three words
[47:24.680 --> 47:29.200]  that's the search term bird government testing and while we're at it if you
[47:29.200 --> 47:33.440]  type in game and I guess until they should be listed into a search engine
[47:33.440 --> 47:36.480]  not in game blueprint for global enslavement just in game it's not
[47:36.480 --> 47:45.040]  Samuel Beckett you know the play it's not the final chess moves and in game
[47:45.040 --> 47:49.360]  it's not even the US government's operation in game that he got
[47:49.360 --> 47:54.800]  declassified after a film came out that's a mass martial law plan and that
[47:54.800 --> 48:03.920]  came out two years ago you just type in end game two words end game and the
[48:03.920 --> 48:09.080]  number one search term in on the web is already my film the free video so let's
[48:09.080 --> 48:15.880]  just make it end game that way number one they'll see bird government testing
[48:15.880 --> 48:20.720]  because if I did something like bird die-off that would just leave people to
[48:20.720 --> 48:25.400]  other stories that don't explain it so we'll do bird government testing bird
[48:25.400 --> 48:29.960]  government testing and end game and that way you'll have number one and number
[48:29.960 --> 48:34.600]  two and then hopefully other blogs and news outfits will not hopefully they
[48:34.600 --> 48:39.060]  always do well then write about our story and then that will get around the
[48:39.060 --> 48:43.320]  electronic Berlin wall or blockade when this becomes the number one search
[48:43.320 --> 48:47.520]  terms in the next few hours they've already delisted us from Google news so
[48:47.520 --> 48:50.800]  that people won't see on the news feature but that won't matter that won't
[48:50.800 --> 48:55.360]  stop the great activist out there so let's search the term bird government
[48:55.360 --> 49:03.800]  testing three words put that in Google over and over again and end game and we
[49:03.800 --> 49:07.800]  could do the third search if you want because they've got hot searches but
[49:07.800 --> 49:11.760]  also hot topics we could have a number one hot topic if it's so long it'll be
[49:11.760 --> 49:16.600]  a hot topic end game blueprint for global enslavement you want to do the
[49:16.600 --> 49:22.200]  whole thing end game blueprint for global enslavement and it's a well
[49:22.200 --> 49:28.840]  produced powerful 2-hour 45-minute film and the top link that let's show folks
[49:28.840 --> 49:34.320]  let's let's go to the devilish CIA Google right now live on screen and if
[49:34.320 --> 49:37.960]  you just put in end game as one word or two words we'll do it as two words end
[49:37.960 --> 49:42.840]  game the top link and at least last time I checked a few months ago the top link
[49:42.840 --> 49:50.640]  when you put in end game is as you can see right there Alex Jones in game so
[49:50.640 --> 49:55.480]  the top three links yep and then there's a Hollywood movie called in game
[49:55.480 --> 50:01.880]  and this number four the number five is us again so there you have it when we're
[50:01.880 --> 50:06.120]  already number one there just naturally so we're just augmenting and creating a
[50:06.120 --> 50:12.080]  synergy there search the term end game as one word or it's two words
[50:12.080 --> 50:20.600]  technically end game is usually two words yeah let me let me search that and
[50:20.600 --> 50:26.520]  make sure yes two words end game is your second search and then bird government
[50:26.520 --> 50:31.080]  testing is the other search and then if you want to have the number one hot
[50:31.080 --> 50:40.120]  topic we can just have end game blueprint for global enslavement and then
[50:40.120 --> 50:43.560]  people will be led when they're interested in looking into the birds
[50:43.560 --> 50:48.200]  they'll be led to the number one suspect I mean if a group's done this tens of
[50:48.200 --> 50:52.040]  thousands of times we know of including lethally killing citizens
[50:52.040 --> 50:56.560]  premeditatedly capital murder then why wouldn't they be the number one
[50:56.560 --> 51:00.360]  suspect see there's a mental block that's been engineered into people want to
[51:00.360 --> 51:03.880]  look at reality we all know that Berkey water purification systems are the

[53:14.920 --> 53:18.920]  true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid
[53:18.920 --> 53:23.480]  technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is
[53:23.480 --> 53:27.520]  dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only
[53:27.520 --> 53:31.320]  compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to
[53:31.320 --> 53:34.920]  local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from weather
[53:34.920 --> 53:39.280]  related onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup
[53:39.280 --> 53:42.400]  insurance and peace of mind folks I really believe in the solar power

[54:04.240 --> 54:11.560]  presents the Alex Jones show because there's a war on for your mind
[54:21.320 --> 54:25.640]  Stefan and Malinu joined us about a month ago but he was on the road and had a
[54:25.640 --> 54:29.520]  bad phone line he's gonna be joining us via video Skype if you're a prison
[54:29.520 --> 54:34.200]  planet.tv viewer so it should be great audio to go over a host of issues with
[54:34.200 --> 54:40.600]  Stefan who's a very popular essayist and author and well-known anarchist a real
[54:40.600 --> 54:44.880]  anarchist not a communist wearing a red star running around burning things on
[54:44.880 --> 54:49.120]  the police payroll that's the system trying to put their false image of an
[54:49.120 --> 54:54.640]  anarchist in there to distract and to divert you so they can bring in their
[54:54.640 --> 54:58.920]  draconian control so we're gonna be talking to Stefan coming up at the
[54:58.920 --> 55:04.120]  eight after I've got a lot of economic news I want to get to natural disaster
[55:04.120 --> 55:11.240]  news killed 295,000 and that's being reported where's the TSA to protect us
[55:11.240 --> 55:15.720]  from natural disasters I mean they can't allow one death oh they've got to take
[55:15.720 --> 55:19.240]  all our rights in case terrorists get us but we have a much better chance of the
[55:19.240 --> 55:25.400]  government terrorist nerve-gassing us or tasering us to death or putting
[55:25.400 --> 55:29.880]  chemicals in our water but that's okay see cuz there's still our protectors but
[55:29.880 --> 55:34.400]  I wanted to shift gears to this economic collapse blog article this videos
[55:34.400 --> 55:39.320]  actually over a year old from the Financial Times of London but notice a
[55:39.320 --> 55:42.840]  year later so much of what he's talked about came true I'm not gonna play the
[55:42.840 --> 55:46.760]  whole thing it's ten minutes long but it's in the article up on info wars.com
[55:46.760 --> 55:51.800]  and prison planet.com titled George Soros the United States must stop
[55:51.800 --> 55:55.960]  resisting the orderly decline of the dollar when that's all we have left
[55:55.960 --> 56:00.040]  globalism promised us milk and honey now we're deindustrialized all we have is
[56:00.040 --> 56:04.540]  the dollar and the coming global currency and the new world order now
[56:04.540 --> 56:10.000]  simultaneously his Huffington Post which he openly finances media matters
[56:10.000 --> 56:16.320]  openly finances them they say that I'm a raving lunatic and none of this world
[56:16.320 --> 56:21.600]  government exist just remember that so we'll go ahead and play part of this
[56:21.600 --> 56:25.000]  clip as we go out to break and we'll come back in the next hour stay with us
[56:25.000 --> 56:29.920]  what sort of a financial deal should Obama be seeking to strike when he
[56:29.920 --> 56:34.080]  travels to China next month no I think this would be the time because you
[56:34.080 --> 56:42.480]  really need to bring China into the creation of a new world order financial
[56:42.480 --> 56:50.800]  world order they are kind of reluctant members of the IMF they play along but
[56:50.800 --> 56:57.920]  they don't make much of a contribution because it's not there not their
[56:57.920 --> 57:05.640]  institution their share is is not commensurate their voting rights are not
[57:05.640 --> 57:13.600]  commensurate to their weight so I think you need a new world order that China
[57:13.600 --> 57:20.280]  has to be part of the process of creating it and they have to buy in
[57:20.280 --> 57:26.880]  they have to own it the same way as let's say the United States owns the
[57:26.880 --> 57:33.080]  Washington consensus the current order and and I think this would be a more
[57:33.080 --> 57:41.480]  stable one where you would have a coordinated policies I think the
[57:41.480 --> 57:49.320]  makings of it are already there because the G20 in agreeing to peer reviews
[57:49.320 --> 57:55.040]  effectively is moving in that direction given this continued weakness in the US
[57:55.040 --> 57:58.920]  economy are people right to start to be concerned about the dollar
[57:58.920 --> 58:04.680]  whether they are of course and the dollar is a very weak currency except
[58:04.680 --> 58:10.840]  except for all the others so there is a general sort of lack of confidence in
[58:10.840 --> 58:21.520]  currencies and a move away from currencies into real assets the Chinese are
[58:21.520 --> 58:29.360]  continuing to run a big trade surplus and they're still accumulating assets and
[58:29.360 --> 58:40.640]  basically the memeby is permanently under value will be back straight with us the
[58:40.640 --> 58:48.080]  GCN radio network providing the world with hard-hitting talk radio GCN great
[58:48.080 --> 58:54.760]  talk radio starts here a very wealthy US citizen is predicting that in 2011 we
[58:54.760 --> 58:59.040]  will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years he says

[59:06.000 --> 59:09.400]  family now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years
[59:09.400 --> 59:14.120]  the crazy part is he's usually right you see he predicted the collapse of GM
[59:14.120 --> 59:17.440]  Danny May Freddie Mac and America's biggest mall owner general growth
[59:17.440 --> 59:22.320]  properties in fact Barron's called his work a dire prophecy recently he

[59:25.920 --> 59:29.880]  most important prediction yet and it's a real eye-opener I can't stress this
[59:29.880 --> 59:33.520]  enough you should at least watch this free video online today he explains
[59:33.520 --> 59:36.720]  everything you need to know including simple steps you can take to protect

[59:57.720 --> 01:00:00.760]  radio network
[01:00:04.520 --> 01:00:12.240]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does
[01:00:12.240 --> 01:00:19.760]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin, Texas
[01:00:19.760 --> 01:00:23.360]  Alex Jones
[01:00:27.320 --> 01:00:33.000]  we've got some huge weather modification news coming up here in just a
[01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:37.600]  moment but you noticed if you just joined us we were playing a clip George
[01:00:37.600 --> 01:00:43.800]  Soros a year ago in an interview with the Financial Times of London a video
[01:00:43.800 --> 01:00:49.360]  interview saying that we must give up the dollars the World Reserve currency
[01:00:49.360 --> 01:00:53.640]  which will devastate the average American because we have no industry to
[01:00:53.640 --> 01:00:56.920]  speak of compared what we have we're so dependent on the dollar as the World
[01:00:56.920 --> 01:01:00.520]  Reserve currency here's an example we pay three bucks a gallon Europeans are
[01:01:00.520 --> 01:01:03.320]  paying seven on average because they don't have the World Reserve currency
[01:01:03.320 --> 01:01:09.160]  okay got that figured out and he went on to say China must own the new world
[01:01:09.160 --> 01:01:14.440]  order they must own it well here's a article out of the Sydney Morning Herald
[01:01:14.440 --> 01:01:23.320]  today China backs Spain to emerge from crisis China is financing the recovery
[01:01:23.320 --> 01:01:31.240]  of Spain your tax money is as well to the private banks that are over there it's
[01:01:31.240 --> 01:01:36.960]  not really a recovery they always bill the latest bloodsucking as a bailout
[01:01:36.960 --> 01:01:42.720]  but but China is buying up Spain economic colonization the biggest owner of
[01:01:42.720 --> 01:01:47.160]  US debt now for two years is China secondarily it's their partners the
[01:01:47.160 --> 01:01:51.760]  private banking families the federal reserves number two so the communist
[01:01:51.760 --> 01:01:56.640]  Chinese with forced abortion forced infanticide medical experiments on
[01:01:56.640 --> 01:02:01.880]  babies they forcibly abort and keep alive all admitted those are the new
[01:02:01.880 --> 01:02:08.400]  good guys kill a million Iraqis so what China is great let's do business with
[01:02:08.400 --> 01:02:12.920]  them well then why not have a police state here see once you're not abhorred
[01:02:12.920 --> 01:02:19.880]  once you're not upset once you're not shocked by dehumanization because you're
[01:02:19.880 --> 01:02:24.280]  modern and cool and sensible well nobody's gonna be shocked by you having
[01:02:24.280 --> 01:02:27.360]  your lunch eight your neighbors aren't gonna carry your dragged off into the
[01:02:27.360 --> 01:02:32.920]  night why not Jack Bauer does that on TV it's cool long as they lick boots
[01:02:32.920 --> 01:02:38.520]  everything's okay so China backs Spain to emerge from crisis China is confident
[01:02:38.520 --> 01:02:42.160]  Spain will recover from its economic crisis in Beijing will buy Spanish public
[01:02:42.160 --> 01:02:46.440]  debt despite market fears of an Irish style bailout a top Chinese official
[01:02:46.440 --> 01:02:51.360]  said Monday why are they doing that well what did Soros say this is so important
[01:02:51.360 --> 01:02:57.200]  what did Soros say a year ago in that Financial Times of London video interview
[01:02:57.200 --> 01:03:02.960]  he said that the the beginning of the end of the dollar would be marked by
[01:03:02.960 --> 01:03:07.560]  China moving away from the dollar in international commerce it's a long
[01:03:07.560 --> 01:03:13.680]  ten minute clip you can go watch the full clip now China three years ago
[01:03:13.680 --> 01:03:17.840]  started creeping away buying a basket of other currencies and not buying as much
[01:03:17.840 --> 01:03:24.320]  US currency now what going back three weeks ago they have begun doing all
[01:03:24.320 --> 01:03:31.480]  trade with Russia in their own currency in the Chinese currency so that's it
[01:03:31.480 --> 01:03:35.360]  that's the big signifier that's when gold and silver started shooting up that's
[01:03:35.360 --> 01:03:38.840]  the game plan so the beginning of the end of the dollar has begun the
[01:03:38.840 --> 01:03:42.760]  globalist may have some curveball in the middle of all this but their stated
[01:03:42.760 --> 01:03:48.920]  policy is global coordinated devaluation not just of the dollar but every major
[01:03:48.920 --> 01:03:54.680]  currency in concert together until they bankrupt them all and bring in the
[01:03:54.680 --> 01:04:01.600]  bandcore SDR global digital currency and we'll pay our carbon taxes and VAT taxes
[01:04:01.600 --> 01:04:10.320]  to these monsters now here's Bloomberg US yield spreads fall below rest of the
[01:04:10.320 --> 01:04:16.200]  world the last three months the Chinese and the Russians have have have gotten
[01:04:16.200 --> 01:04:22.200]  rid of the US triple a rating for US bonds but it takes a while for a big
[01:04:22.200 --> 01:04:27.760]  elephant to die or at least it's already dead before it's body to cool off but
[01:04:27.760 --> 01:04:32.200]  for the first time on record investors are demanding a smaller premium to own
[01:04:32.200 --> 01:04:41.520]  US corporate bonds than global company debt bondholders demanded 166 basis
[01:04:41.520 --> 01:04:47.440]  points and bids yields to hold US investment grade company debt instead
[01:04:47.440 --> 01:04:53.720]  of Treasury so it's continuing we've been set up to be butchered and we
[01:04:53.720 --> 01:04:56.520]  probably will be because the average adults still suck on their thumb only
[01:04:56.520 --> 01:05:05.720]  talking about sports hi this is Alex Jones you've heard me talk about the

[01:06:19.120 --> 01:06:23.720]  calling the shots I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American

[01:08:08.600 --> 01:08:14.280]  going to our guest here just a moment before I go any further we've been
[01:08:14.280 --> 01:08:20.840]  covering the mass bird and fish die off and ask the question is it connected to
[01:08:20.840 --> 01:08:26.680]  secret government testing that'll be my first question for Stefan Malonev here
[01:08:26.680 --> 01:08:32.520]  in just a moment before we get into other issues with him but Tim Fruget the
[01:08:32.520 --> 01:08:36.280]  back office a shipping department manager ran back in here and he said have
[01:08:36.280 --> 01:08:40.120]  you seen the mail online the Daily Mail newspaper I said no
[01:08:40.120 --> 01:08:44.520]  I'm going to show it to you right now have scientists discovered how to create
[01:08:44.520 --> 01:08:51.800]  downpours in the desert and then the next graphic says ionizers produce
[01:08:51.800 --> 01:08:58.280]  charged particles into the desert air negatively charged ions rise with the
[01:08:58.280 --> 01:09:02.600]  hot air and attract dust moisture condenses around
[01:09:02.600 --> 01:09:08.360]  the charged dust eventually this turns to cloud which produces rain
[01:09:08.360 --> 01:09:12.200]  now that's terraforming terraforming is a planet that's unlivable
[01:09:12.200 --> 01:09:18.040]  technically a geoengineering now there was a Nobel prize winner what 92 with the
[01:09:18.040 --> 01:09:22.120]  patents for chemicals to be added to jet fuel to
[01:09:22.120 --> 01:09:27.480]  create a cloud system over the earth that would actually heat the earth
[01:09:27.480 --> 01:09:31.720]  I read to you secretary of defense Cohen in army times talking about tectonic
[01:09:31.720 --> 01:09:35.640]  weapons they've developed it came out what last year in fact search the term
[01:09:35.640 --> 01:09:40.040]  Israelis testing underground nukes to create earthquakes that was in the
[01:09:40.040 --> 01:09:45.160]  Israeli newspapers I mean there's all sorts of craziness going on
[01:09:45.160 --> 01:09:52.520]  but then we talk about it and we're nuts you talk to the average yuppie
[01:09:52.520 --> 01:09:55.880]  and they just say this doesn't exist I mean if you told them a Model T car
[01:09:55.880 --> 01:09:59.560]  exist if the government didn't give them the okay to talk about it existing
[01:09:59.560 --> 01:10:03.960]  they'd say you were nuts a scientist again have created 50 rainstorms in
[01:10:03.960 --> 01:10:09.400]  Abu Dhabi's Al-Alen region just last year alone and that's
[01:10:09.400 --> 01:10:12.760]  what they're admitting they're doing so governments I mean they have a treaty
[01:10:12.760 --> 01:10:16.680]  back in 77 from the UN about this banning it
[01:10:16.680 --> 01:10:19.640]  why would they need a treaty if it didn't exist
[01:10:19.640 --> 01:10:23.880]  I've had the father weather weapons been living stood on the show
[01:10:23.880 --> 01:10:27.880]  meteorologist it's all there and in our
[01:10:27.880 --> 01:10:32.520]  eugenics film only one chapter and it'll have more chemtrail info than
[01:10:32.520 --> 01:10:36.680]  anyone's ever put out it's got all the patents how they do it how they
[01:10:36.680 --> 01:10:40.680]  operate it's all compartmentalized the average airline doesn't even know
[01:10:40.680 --> 01:10:44.600]  it's added to the jet fuel manufacturers and that's why
[01:10:44.600 --> 01:10:48.920]  20 years ago jets didn't leave trails that lasted more than a minute or two
[01:10:48.920 --> 01:10:53.640]  now they last for hours and hours and create that haze I watched it yesterday
[01:10:53.640 --> 01:10:58.680]  this is mass terra farming creating bizarre weather then they offer their
[01:10:58.680 --> 01:11:02.600]  solution total government control they want to be
[01:11:02.600 --> 01:11:06.360]  god that's what eugenics is all about but here it is
[01:11:06.360 --> 01:11:09.560]  have scientists discovered how to create downpours in the desert
[01:11:09.560 --> 01:11:14.360]  and then they just go on and admit the whole thing and when you look at these
[01:11:14.360 --> 01:11:18.360]  towers this is what the Atlantic richfield
[01:11:18.360 --> 01:11:25.240]  1960s harp patents state is that it was weather control
[01:11:25.240 --> 01:11:29.160]  by ionizing the atmosphere and if you go out to Alaska and other heart
[01:11:29.160 --> 01:11:32.360]  facilities they've got one near Austin and you look at these they always
[01:11:32.360 --> 01:11:35.240]  claim their Doppler radar or there's something or they're you know just
[01:11:35.240 --> 01:11:38.520]  testing the atmosphere no these are weather control systems
[01:11:38.520 --> 01:11:41.560]  this is exactly what has been built all over the world
[01:11:41.560 --> 01:11:46.360]  with your money and of course we have a nice photo of the queen of
[01:11:46.360 --> 01:11:52.760]  England hanging out with the chic into the United Arab Emirates
[01:11:52.760 --> 01:11:56.520]  they're enjoying their weather control there just completely disgusting
[01:11:56.520 --> 01:12:02.280]  all part of playing god and controlling our atmosphere
[01:12:02.280 --> 01:12:06.360]  very interesting information so this is all going on
[01:12:06.360 --> 01:12:09.560]  so if we have a government that admittedly
[01:12:09.560 --> 01:12:15.400]  thousands of times has run test in some cases thousands of times per test so
[01:12:15.400 --> 01:12:18.760]  we're in the tens of thousands hundreds of thousands overall
[01:12:18.760 --> 01:12:22.680]  nerve-gassing trips radiating foster children to death
[01:12:22.680 --> 01:12:27.320]  and every major government does it what is that all really about setting the
[01:12:27.320 --> 01:12:29.320]  pressure that the control freaks are god
[01:12:29.320 --> 01:12:33.000]  that we're animals creating cadres that will follow orders to kill
[01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:36.520]  upon order what is it really all about
[01:12:36.520 --> 01:12:39.800]  and joining us a little bit of the next hour if we're getting him on a bit late
[01:12:39.800 --> 01:12:45.400]  via video link is Stefan Molyneux a Canadian philosopher blogger
[01:12:45.400 --> 01:12:51.640]  sas author and host of free domain radio series of podcasts very articulate
[01:12:51.640 --> 01:12:54.360]  gentlemen some great videos have been made with his work
[01:12:54.360 --> 01:12:57.640]  he's written numerous articles then published on libertarian websites is
[01:12:57.640 --> 01:13:01.560]  lu rockwell.com any war and we really appreciate him joining us
[01:13:01.560 --> 01:13:05.800]  he's a multi-time author he has written on truth the tyranny of illusions
[01:13:05.800 --> 01:13:10.040]  universally preferable behavior it just goes on we'll talk about it all
[01:13:10.040 --> 01:13:14.600]  with him his website is free domain radio.com
[01:13:14.600 --> 01:13:17.960]  and we've got him linked up on info wars.com but Stefan
[01:13:17.960 --> 01:13:21.800]  what is the nature of the control freak and why do they always
[01:13:21.800 --> 01:13:25.400]  like a tropism like a spider spends a certain type of web
[01:13:25.400 --> 01:13:29.880]  a plant turns towards the sun why do governments always wear black uniforms
[01:13:29.880 --> 01:13:33.000]  and in the end start mass murdering and burning everything
[01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:37.480]  while running around naked declaring themselves god we now see tsa weekly
[01:13:37.480 --> 01:13:40.360]  literally going crazy declaring god stripping down naked
[01:13:40.360 --> 01:13:44.600]  what is that tropism and how do we deal with it and why did that why is there
[01:13:44.600 --> 01:13:51.640]  sacrament uh murdering children well power is an addiction
[01:13:51.640 --> 01:13:57.160]  and power can't be understood outside the context of psychological addictions
[01:13:57.160 --> 01:14:00.760]  and psychological addictions always escalate like if you've ever known
[01:14:00.760 --> 01:14:04.040]  someone with a drug problem or a drinking problem
[01:14:04.040 --> 01:14:07.480]  the they always escalate until there's a catastrophe and then
[01:14:07.480 --> 01:14:11.480]  and then and sometimes only then there is the possibility
[01:14:11.480 --> 01:14:14.680]  that people will wake up and say you know wait if you're a heavy drinker and
[01:14:14.680 --> 01:14:17.160]  you find yourself lying in a ditch in vegas with
[01:14:17.160 --> 01:14:20.440]  i don't know a dead hooker or something like that then part of you is going to
[01:14:20.440 --> 01:14:23.960]  say maybe just maybe i should look into my drinking as a problem
[01:14:23.960 --> 01:14:27.960]  we're very close to that cliff edge in my opinion right now as you say the fear
[01:14:27.960 --> 01:14:31.960]  currency is going down wiki leaks is about to expose the fact that
[01:14:31.960 --> 01:14:36.600]  bank of america is probably extremely corrupt and has no particular ownership
[01:14:36.600 --> 01:14:40.200]  of the homes that they're foreclosing on which is going to cause a massive run
[01:14:40.200 --> 01:14:46.360]  on us debt and so we're right close to sort of waking up in the ditch in vegas
[01:14:46.360 --> 01:14:51.160]  and saying to ourselves what are we doing by putting these nutjobs with guns
[01:14:51.160 --> 01:14:55.880]  at the center of organizing society and how could we expect the initiation of
[01:14:55.880 --> 01:15:00.200]  force in the solution of social problems to to come up with anything
[01:15:00.200 --> 01:15:04.120]  other than all of these series of catastrophes and disasters for the
[01:15:04.120 --> 01:15:09.880]  common man very well said i want one of your many
[01:15:09.880 --> 01:15:14.840]  research points is that nations are judge and i agree with you are
[01:15:14.840 --> 01:15:21.480]  basically nothing more than farms different systems of farming and how
[01:15:21.480 --> 01:15:26.760]  the more open farms always create incredible inventions and wealth but
[01:15:26.760 --> 01:15:30.840]  then that allows the parasites to grow and it's a cycle
[01:15:30.840 --> 01:15:33.960]  break that down briefly and then let's get into
[01:15:33.960 --> 01:15:37.960]  the wiki leaks information i was told by john young big wiki leaks insider
[01:15:37.960 --> 01:15:41.560]  who want to get back on this week jaren forgot to tell you that uh that it
[01:15:41.560 --> 01:15:45.560]  would be bank of america and other big banks now the mainstream media is
[01:15:45.560 --> 01:15:48.920]  saying that's indeed what's about to happen give us your view on what that's
[01:15:48.920 --> 01:15:54.040]  going to trigger but first uh you know that amazing breakdown you do
[01:15:54.040 --> 01:15:57.160]  when and it's complex but at the same time simple
[01:15:57.160 --> 01:16:02.680]  explaining how society really operates sure if you think about floating above
[01:16:02.680 --> 01:16:06.440]  a map of the world then you see of course countries with borders and
[01:16:06.440 --> 01:16:10.360]  different colors and my perspective is that and it's a
[01:16:10.360 --> 01:16:13.240]  very strong case to be made for this that what you're looking at
[01:16:13.240 --> 01:16:18.280]  is a series of tax farms where human beings are encouraged to breed
[01:16:18.280 --> 01:16:22.040]  and then when they breed for the most part their children are taken into the
[01:16:22.040 --> 01:16:25.480]  care of the state in other words to break the parent child bond
[01:16:25.480 --> 01:16:29.080]  most people are forced because of high taxation to go to parents are forced to
[01:16:29.080 --> 01:16:32.120]  go to work in the marketplace which means that state
[01:16:32.120 --> 01:16:35.240]  run or state licensed daycares take over the children
[01:16:35.240 --> 01:16:39.000]  which is something that the the church in its wildest dreams could never have
[01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:42.120]  imagined and uh then the these children are
[01:16:42.120 --> 01:16:46.120]  brought up with adherence to the state as parent and then they're told that the
[01:16:46.120 --> 01:16:49.480]  state is there to help them and there to take care of them and there to organize
[01:16:49.480 --> 01:16:53.240]  things and they're made afraid of freedom in other words if you can
[01:16:53.240 --> 01:16:56.840]  convince your livestock that out there beyond the field
[01:16:56.840 --> 01:17:00.840]  is nothing but predators and danger then you don't actually even need to build
[01:17:00.840 --> 01:17:03.560]  a fence because they'll all just stay in the invisible
[01:17:03.560 --> 01:17:08.680]  electronic fence of propaganda and so people grow up and one of the amazing
[01:17:08.680 --> 01:17:12.520]  things that has happened in the democratic or crony capitalist model
[01:17:12.520 --> 01:17:15.880]  which is what the u.s and most of western europe is currently running under
[01:17:15.880 --> 01:17:19.800]  and my home tax farm of canada is that they realized
[01:17:19.800 --> 01:17:23.720]  that if you don't force someone into an occupation which was the feudal and the
[01:17:23.720 --> 01:17:26.680]  roman model if you allow someone to choose his own
[01:17:26.680 --> 01:17:30.680]  occupation he's going to feel a lot more free and he's going to be a lot more
[01:17:30.680 --> 01:17:33.640]  productive because he's going to have enthusiasm you can't make
[01:17:33.640 --> 01:17:36.840]  slaves enthusiastic you can't make serfs enthusiastic
[01:17:36.840 --> 01:17:40.200]  but people who become lawyers and doctors and accountants and
[01:17:40.200 --> 01:17:43.960]  podcasters have an enthusiasm because they believe that they're in control of
[01:17:43.960 --> 01:17:47.000]  their own lives but of course unless you control the currency unless the
[01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:49.880]  citizens control the currency there's no freedom either
[01:17:49.880 --> 01:17:53.640]  economic or political whatsoever so because we're allowed we are allowed
[01:17:53.640 --> 01:17:56.200]  to choose our own occupations with that much more productive
[01:17:56.200 --> 01:18:00.200]  we create that much more wealth which is a story since the industrial revolution
[01:18:00.200 --> 01:18:05.080]  however that wealth is then further taxed and further taxed to create a
[01:18:05.080 --> 01:18:09.800]  massive and bloated slug like leech of a ruling class that hangs
[01:18:09.800 --> 01:18:13.960]  off the economic jugular of the citizenry until
[01:18:13.960 --> 01:18:17.240]  like a cancer it grows to the point where it overwhelms
[01:18:17.240 --> 01:18:20.200]  the host and that's what of course is happening with the government but you
[01:18:20.200 --> 01:18:24.200]  have to crossroads that we've now entered will we kick the giant
[01:18:24.200 --> 01:18:28.760]  parasitic vampiric slug dripping with pus off of us
[01:18:28.760 --> 01:18:34.120]  or this slug has mind control beams through the television its eyes blank
[01:18:34.120 --> 01:18:37.800]  you know teaching you to love it and see it as a beautiful blonde
[01:18:37.800 --> 01:18:41.000]  but i mean can we break the conditioning and see that it's a you know
[01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:44.840]  vomit reeking slug and will we pull it off of us and then
[01:18:44.840 --> 01:18:49.080]  you know crawl away and you know get some sustenance and survive
[01:18:49.080 --> 01:18:55.080]  or will we succumb to the slug and let it fully suck us dry with its scruffulous
[01:18:55.080 --> 01:18:59.320]  scruffulous mouth first of all i'd like you to thank you alex for really getting
[01:18:59.320 --> 01:19:02.440]  behind my metaphor and giving it a good push i think that really propelled it
[01:19:02.440 --> 01:19:08.040]  to new york we can we absolutely can because we have mind
[01:19:08.040 --> 01:19:11.720]  freeing rays called internet data packets which people can get
[01:19:11.720 --> 01:19:14.600]  information that previously was completely unavailable
[01:19:14.600 --> 01:19:19.480]  so we can but there's no certainty that we will that depends upon the actions
[01:19:19.480 --> 01:19:23.480]  and commitment and intensity of individuals and this is the kind of
[01:19:23.480 --> 01:19:27.560]  problem that does not appear to happen in a
[01:19:27.560 --> 01:19:31.800]  catastrophic way until it's almost too late so get in people to wake up to the
[01:19:31.800 --> 01:19:34.680]  rumblings at the top of the mountain saying there's going to be an avalanche
[01:19:34.680 --> 01:19:37.160]  there's going to be an avalanche and people are like no it's just snowing a
[01:19:37.160 --> 01:19:40.840]  little you know it's so sometimes that's the challenge that we have to do to
[01:19:40.840 --> 01:19:45.240]  remind people that we're not crazy for saying wake up wake up and act
[01:19:45.240 --> 01:19:48.920]  absolutely stefan malinu is our guest we're going to come right back with him

[01:24:17.640 --> 01:24:20.520]  you know i don't know who to believe about the whole wiki licks thing but i
[01:24:20.520 --> 01:24:25.480]  know this it's a case point it's a test case
[01:24:25.480 --> 01:24:29.960]  if they are allowed to arrest or imprison or even execute as Bill O'Reilly
[01:24:29.960 --> 01:24:33.640]  and Huckabee and others have called for then there's no free
[01:24:33.640 --> 01:24:37.160]  press in this world and i've seen Sarah Palin say that he's
[01:24:37.160 --> 01:24:40.760]  un-american and that he should be extradited here well
[01:24:40.760 --> 01:24:45.640]  he's not an american so i mean it really shows that Sarah Palin
[01:24:45.640 --> 01:24:48.440]  whatever you think of her is not the sharpest knife in the drawer it's when
[01:24:48.440 --> 01:24:52.760]  she talked about our ally north korea i mean she's not
[01:24:52.760 --> 01:24:56.440]  she's not fit to be dog catcher just with her knowledge of the world but
[01:24:56.440 --> 01:25:01.480]  that's a distraction overall the point i was trying to get to here
[01:25:01.480 --> 01:25:05.960]  is that a lot of people i respect like Wayne Madsen and others and
[01:25:05.960 --> 01:25:11.800]  John Young of krypton who registered the wiki leaks domain have said it's
[01:25:11.800 --> 01:25:16.920]  full of intelligence agency operatives and that i remember hearing a year ago
[01:25:16.920 --> 01:25:19.400]  that next it would be going after banks
[01:25:19.400 --> 01:25:23.720]  specifically enemies of george soros and others and
[01:25:23.720 --> 01:25:27.800]  now we see that coming out but uh overall it's very positive to have an
[01:25:27.800 --> 01:25:31.880]  open free society and i just see wiki leaks being used
[01:25:31.880 --> 01:25:35.400]  as an electronic pearl harbor and i predicted that
[01:25:35.400 --> 01:25:38.760]  and now they want to come in with total draconian control
[01:25:38.760 --> 01:25:43.480]  in the name of restricting the web because of wiki leaks
[01:25:43.480 --> 01:25:46.200]  so i think at certain levels this is being manipulated
[01:25:46.200 --> 01:25:50.600]  Stefan please continue well i think that the wiki leaks
[01:25:50.600 --> 01:25:54.440]  is um interesting because the revelations about the war in
[01:25:54.440 --> 01:25:58.440]  afghanistan did not meet with much outrage from media pundits
[01:25:58.440 --> 01:26:03.080]  the revelations about the spying on un members and other nasty things that
[01:26:03.080 --> 01:26:06.200]  were going on in american intelligence the community
[01:26:06.200 --> 01:26:10.280]  was not met with much much outrage now the outrage is really boiling over
[01:26:10.280 --> 01:26:13.160]  because this is going to cut to the financial juggler
[01:26:13.160 --> 01:26:16.760]  of the fiat currency system because what happened of course as you know
[01:26:16.760 --> 01:26:21.000]  is that people took out mortgages for the banks the banks packaged them up
[01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:26.200]  and basically took a a cup of liquid blue liquid and put it into the ocean in
[01:26:26.200 --> 01:26:29.240]  other words they spliced and diced all of these mortgages and sold them in bits
[01:26:29.240 --> 01:26:32.840]  and pieces all over the world and now that the mortgages are failing
[01:26:32.840 --> 01:26:36.200]  people are saying okay who owns my house like if you want to take my house back
[01:26:36.200 --> 01:26:39.400]  you have to prove to me that you own it but this has all been turned into
[01:26:39.400 --> 01:26:42.840]  confetti all these deeds of ownership have been turned into confetti and blown
[01:26:42.840 --> 01:26:46.680]  into the four winds and there's nothing there that that anybody owns in
[01:26:46.680 --> 01:26:51.080]  particular and if bank of america knew this and foreclosed
[01:26:51.080 --> 01:26:55.000]  anyway then they're going to be liable to significant criminal proceedings
[01:26:55.000 --> 01:26:59.240]  that's going to go past to other banks in the u.s system and overseas
[01:26:59.240 --> 01:27:02.760]  which is going to be a hammer blow to the transferring fiat currency system
[01:27:02.760 --> 01:27:05.960]  around the world and i think that's what people are becoming so hysterical
[01:27:05.960 --> 01:27:09.800]  about that's why people are calling for the assassination of this guy who did
[01:27:09.800 --> 01:27:13.960]  nothing he actually released all of his information through mainstream
[01:27:13.960 --> 01:27:17.000]  media but of course they're not courageous enough to go after the
[01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:19.320]  mainstream media because they need the mainstream media
[01:27:19.320 --> 01:27:23.720]  to lull the sheep with shiny objects of nonsense and inconsequentiality
[01:27:23.720 --> 01:27:26.520]  so i think it's really important to understand that
[01:27:26.520 --> 01:27:30.520]  there's a lot more at stake for the ruling class with the bank of america
[01:27:30.520 --> 01:27:34.600]  potential scandal than there ever was with the revelations about dishonesty
[01:27:34.600 --> 01:27:40.360]  in in war and diplomacy well there's something more here
[01:27:40.360 --> 01:27:45.080]  and i want to get your take on this step on that this too big to fail has been
[01:27:45.080 --> 01:27:48.680]  their plan since the fellow reserve act of 1913
[01:27:48.680 --> 01:27:51.960]  these private banking families have used similar systems
[01:27:51.960 --> 01:27:55.640]  in europe in the third world over and over again
[01:27:55.640 --> 01:28:00.840]  by connecting everybody's pension funds and investments
[01:28:00.840 --> 01:28:06.360]  to this toxic stew of derivatives that have been mixed in with all the real
[01:28:06.360 --> 01:28:10.280]  investments they can now always hold people hostage
[01:28:10.280 --> 01:28:16.440]  to give us unlimited trillions bail us out give us more power or we'll bring
[01:28:16.440 --> 01:28:20.120]  the whole system down but if you look at the mathematical breakdown
[01:28:20.120 --> 01:28:23.720]  it's a foregone conclusion that nothing can fix this
[01:28:23.720 --> 01:28:28.760]  all we can do is go ahead and take the hit and then arrest these criminals
[01:28:28.760 --> 01:28:32.120]  well yeah that's that's absolutely right the system can't be recovered i think
[01:28:32.120 --> 01:28:36.840]  it's important to understand as well that the war chest of money
[01:28:36.840 --> 01:28:40.520]  was at its very highest peak because of course all the social security money
[01:28:40.520 --> 01:28:45.080]  has been collected and largely spent but this is right before the biggest
[01:28:45.080 --> 01:28:48.440]  payout of government to citizen in history which is the retirement of the
[01:28:48.440 --> 01:28:51.640]  baby boomer so the amount of money that the government owes
[01:28:51.640 --> 01:28:55.640]  is right at its peak and right before all of this money needs to start being
[01:28:55.640 --> 01:28:59.080]  paid out in in health care and in old age pensions to people
[01:28:59.080 --> 01:29:03.080]  the system itself gets completely pillaged and i do exactly right at the
[01:29:03.080 --> 01:29:07.320]  time right at the time that the baby boomer starts to retire
[01:29:07.320 --> 01:29:10.840]  oh they've been investing all these years guess what it's been stolen
[01:29:10.840 --> 01:29:14.200]  so baby boomers you better submit to total big government
[01:29:14.200 --> 01:29:18.600]  and all these new taxes on the young people and join us in the too big to
[01:29:18.600 --> 01:29:22.600]  fail or you'll never get your money but we know from the third world
[01:29:22.600 --> 01:29:27.000]  experiences argentina the list goes on and on
[01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:32.440]  brazil nigeria zimbabwe eastern europe weimar republic germany
[01:29:32.440 --> 01:29:37.160]  that once the yuppies buy in to the immorality of robbing everybody below
[01:29:37.160 --> 01:29:40.280]  them then they're going to have it all taken from them as well stay there i
[01:29:40.280 --> 01:29:43.560]  want you to continue on that key point amazing point
[01:29:43.560 --> 01:29:47.480]  that stefan just made stay with us
[01:29:47.480 --> 01:29:54.920]  we're on the march the empires on the run
[01:29:54.920 --> 01:30:00.600]  alex jones and the gcn radio network
[01:30:00.600 --> 01:30:03.800]  this is alex jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a
[01:30:03.800 --> 01:30:07.800]  solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily
[01:30:07.800 --> 01:30:11.800]  double or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants
[01:30:11.800 --> 01:30:15.160]  to control how much power your electric company allows you to have
[01:30:15.160 --> 01:30:18.120]  it's true total government control of electricity
[01:30:18.120 --> 01:30:21.640]  in the name of smart grid technology is coming number three
[01:30:21.640 --> 01:30:25.240]  in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded
[01:30:25.240 --> 01:30:29.160]  and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem
[01:30:29.160 --> 01:30:32.680]  number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids
[01:30:32.680 --> 01:30:35.800]  every year thousands of families lose their power from weather related
[01:30:35.800 --> 01:30:38.840]  onages number five a solar power generator provides

[01:33:28.840 --> 01:33:31.960]  moment don't forget we're doing some key search
[01:33:31.960 --> 01:33:35.640]  terms today we want to make these search terms
[01:33:35.640 --> 01:33:39.880]  number one so we can reach a lot of people
[01:33:39.880 --> 01:33:43.720]  out there and if you go up to info wars
[01:33:43.720 --> 01:33:47.880]  dot com and prison planet dot com you can get this story
[01:33:47.880 --> 01:33:53.080]  is mass bird and fish die off connected to government testing
[01:33:53.080 --> 01:33:56.600]  and then when you read to the article you learn it is government
[01:33:56.600 --> 01:34:00.120]  or this criminal organization known as government
[01:34:00.120 --> 01:34:05.000]  that is the number one suspect in the mass bird die off in arkansas
[01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:07.720]  and when people read the article they won't just learn about the birds they'll
[01:34:07.720 --> 01:34:11.800]  learn about all of the or many of the admissions of the government actually
[01:34:11.800 --> 01:34:16.040]  murdering innocent people in cold blood just to see if they could get away
[01:34:16.040 --> 01:34:20.120]  with it
[01:34:20.120 --> 01:34:23.880]  they are exempt from the laws that they erect to ensnare us
[01:34:23.880 --> 01:34:27.080]  so we're doing the search term bird government testing
[01:34:27.080 --> 01:34:30.680]  that's one search term put those three words into google and then the second
[01:34:30.680 --> 01:34:37.160]  search term is end game two words end game
[01:34:37.160 --> 01:34:40.920]  dealing with my film that's free at youtube that's
[01:34:40.920 --> 01:34:45.960]  over two hours long very well done that covers the entire globalist depopulation
[01:34:45.960 --> 01:34:49.320]  program because knowing their operation is half the
[01:34:49.320 --> 01:34:55.400]  battle as gi joe would say also yes all of my films are available
[01:34:55.400 --> 01:35:00.040]  for free online we promote that we push that because the general public is
[01:35:00.040 --> 01:35:06.920]  still in a myopic morass of of of literal dream state
[01:35:06.920 --> 01:35:11.240]  but those of you who support what we do you make it possible
[01:35:11.240 --> 01:35:14.520]  and you get the films first and you get them in higher quality and there's a
[01:35:14.520 --> 01:35:17.640]  better download function you get the live video stream and the
[01:35:17.640 --> 01:35:22.840]  higher quality audio podcast and i ask prisonplanet.tv members who pay 15
[01:35:22.840 --> 01:35:29.800]  cents a day 595 a month to support us by getting a membership
[01:35:29.800 --> 01:35:33.880]  but every year in december and a little bit into january
[01:35:33.880 --> 01:35:37.000]  we've got a deal where you can get five months free when you sign up you pay
[01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:40.040]  for 6.7 months you get 5.3 months freeze what it
[01:35:40.040 --> 01:35:42.680]  comes out to and we're not the government coming
[01:35:42.680 --> 01:35:45.720]  with a gun and pointing it right at your head
[01:35:45.720 --> 01:35:49.240]  and saying give me this money i'm gonna blow your head off
[01:35:49.240 --> 01:35:53.800]  but then notice that the government then lies and tries to demonize the
[01:35:53.800 --> 01:35:57.160]  liberty movement whenever we try to fund ourselves
[01:35:57.160 --> 01:36:01.000]  as if it's wrong for me to even put films out for free but then say
[01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:04.040]  if you want it the highest quality and to support us
[01:36:04.040 --> 01:36:09.640]  buy the dvds the t-shirts the ball caps the materials at info wars.com
[01:36:09.640 --> 01:36:14.920]  which also further spread the word so again ladies and gentlemen we
[01:36:14.920 --> 01:36:19.080]  need the capital to fund our operation to continue growing
[01:36:19.080 --> 01:36:22.280]  and engaging the globalists and who can deny we're at the tip of the spear
[01:36:22.280 --> 01:36:24.440]  thanks to your support and the information we cover
[01:36:24.440 --> 01:36:28.360]  and my great crew and the genesis network and all of our affiliates
[01:36:28.360 --> 01:36:32.760]  but i want to make it very plain again now is the time to get a prison planet
[01:36:32.760 --> 01:36:35.000]  dot tv membership now is the time to get multiple
[01:36:35.000 --> 01:36:38.280]  memberships and give them to friends and family you just create multiple
[01:36:38.280 --> 01:36:41.240]  memberships with username and passcodes and then give them the username and
[01:36:41.240 --> 01:36:45.960]  passcode in an email as a card and then you give them the gift of
[01:36:45.960 --> 01:36:48.840]  reality the gift of awakening the gift of
[01:36:48.840 --> 01:36:53.000]  understanding all i'm trying to get people to do
[01:36:53.000 --> 01:36:56.600]  is to simply question things and to study history
[01:36:56.600 --> 01:37:00.360]  and if you do that you'll realize we're not in kansas anymore
[01:37:00.360 --> 01:37:03.640]  and this cycle of corruption is coming to a head
[01:37:03.640 --> 01:37:10.040]  in a very violent way but thanks to your support hundreds and hundreds and
[01:37:10.040 --> 01:37:12.760]  hundreds of millions of people just the last few years
[01:37:12.760 --> 01:37:16.040]  have seen our films for free on different online video platforms
[01:37:16.040 --> 01:37:22.440]  the file sharing the youtube the google and it's an exponential growth curve
[01:37:22.440 --> 01:37:26.440]  to the point of i got nightline down here interviewing me rolling stone for a
[01:37:26.440 --> 01:37:31.400]  cover story i mean msnbc and yeah most of them are hit pieces
[01:37:31.400 --> 01:37:35.240]  but they're having to respond because we've developed
[01:37:35.240 --> 01:37:40.280]  a giant monster audience that is active and the system is now
[01:37:40.280 --> 01:37:43.160]  understanding that ignoring us hasn't worked for them
[01:37:43.160 --> 01:37:46.600]  it's backfired so they're now having to engage us
[01:37:46.600 --> 01:37:50.440]  we've got the big guns trained on us what did gondy say first
[01:37:50.440 --> 01:37:53.560]  they ignore you then they laugh at you then they attack you
[01:37:53.560 --> 01:37:56.600]  then you win so now is the time to spread the word
[01:37:56.600 --> 01:38:01.240]  about info wars dot com what we do more than ever and other great activist out
[01:38:01.240 --> 01:38:05.240]  there of course uh like our guest who joins us
[01:38:05.240 --> 01:38:09.640]  stefan malinu of free domain radio dot com
[01:38:09.640 --> 01:38:13.800]  okay stefan you got cut off by the break and my gibbering
[01:38:13.800 --> 01:38:17.880]  uh i was getting into the fact of because i was bringing another element
[01:38:17.880 --> 01:38:22.280]  about how right is in europe and the united states and england and canada
[01:38:22.280 --> 01:38:26.360]  right as people have been paying into these social security Ponzi schemes
[01:38:26.360 --> 01:38:29.240]  right as we're supposed to get our pension funds that we've invested
[01:38:29.240 --> 01:38:33.720]  you know in these private systems it's all gone in derivatives
[01:38:33.720 --> 01:38:37.320]  and then we get the internal goldman sacks emails they knew all about it
[01:38:37.320 --> 01:38:41.160]  we know it was premeditated and so they're holding the yuppies hostage
[01:38:41.160 --> 01:38:45.320]  saying if you want your goodies you better go along with total government
[01:38:45.320 --> 01:38:48.920]  and really raping younger people now will they buy into that
[01:38:48.920 --> 01:38:51.800]  stefan how do you see all this coming together
[01:38:51.800 --> 01:38:57.080]  well look i mean there is a very strong problem a huge problem that governments
[01:38:57.080 --> 01:39:00.760]  around the world are facing at the moment which is that they have no money
[01:39:00.760 --> 01:39:04.600]  to pay off the social security and medicare medicaid bills that
[01:39:04.600 --> 01:39:08.840]  there are due and like anybody who's caught with their
[01:39:08.840 --> 01:39:12.040]  pants down who's not a very good person the first thing that governments are
[01:39:12.040 --> 01:39:16.360]  trying to do is to create a scapegoat as to why the money isn't there
[01:39:16.360 --> 01:39:19.800]  and they're going to have a lot of explaining to do as ricky riccardo used
[01:39:19.800 --> 01:39:22.600]  to say they're going to have a lot of explaining to do to the population who
[01:39:22.600 --> 01:39:25.640]  have no other options they've been taxed so heavily
[01:39:25.640 --> 01:39:28.760]  their savings have been pillaged their houses have been devalued they have
[01:39:28.760 --> 01:39:31.720]  nothing or a lot of people have almost nothing to retire on
[01:39:31.720 --> 01:39:35.320]  i mean the majority of americans are literally living pennies to pennies pay
[01:39:35.320 --> 01:39:37.880]  check to pay check they have nothing to retire on
[01:39:37.880 --> 01:39:41.080]  so governments have no money to pay them and so what are they going to do well
[01:39:41.080 --> 01:39:44.440]  they create a crisis they pillage what's left and then they can blame the banks
[01:39:44.440 --> 01:39:47.240]  and they can blame capitalism they can blame freedom
[01:39:47.240 --> 01:39:50.520]  and then they can move in and say well you know we tried giving your retirement
[01:39:50.520 --> 01:39:53.400]  money to the stock market but the stock market pillaged it all so now we're
[01:39:53.400 --> 01:39:57.640]  going to have to take over even more it really is up to people who've got
[01:39:57.640 --> 01:40:00.840]  the economic knowledge and intelligence and hopefully
[01:40:00.840 --> 01:40:04.600]  communications abilities to remind people that the problem
[01:40:04.600 --> 01:40:09.560]  is not the handshake the problem is always the gun the gun the gun the gun
[01:40:09.560 --> 01:40:12.840]  in the room is what is always causing the problem the fact
[01:40:12.840 --> 01:40:16.440]  that the government has the monopoly on violence is what is causing all these
[01:40:16.440 --> 01:40:20.280]  problems the stock market is a completely bizarre and mutated
[01:40:20.280 --> 01:40:23.320]  entity relative to its original it's totally rigged and i want you to get
[01:40:23.320 --> 01:40:26.680]  into that and and the whole system of government being a gang
[01:40:26.680 --> 01:40:30.440]  with a flag and a propaganda corps but but going back because i want you to
[01:40:30.440 --> 01:40:33.960]  quantify this and i want to quantify my position
[01:40:33.960 --> 01:40:37.960]  yes they are using uh what's happened with the banks
[01:40:37.960 --> 01:40:42.200]  as a way to demonize capitalism but that's free market
[01:40:42.200 --> 01:40:46.520]  free will moral capitalism not the crony
[01:40:46.520 --> 01:40:54.040]  fascist insider capitalism the the the the the predatory capitalism isn't
[01:40:54.040 --> 01:40:58.840]  capitalism at all it's big mega corporations using government
[01:40:58.840 --> 01:41:02.680]  to consolidate power so it's the mega elite on record
[01:41:02.680 --> 01:41:06.840]  preparing to scapegoat the middle class smaller banks
[01:41:06.840 --> 01:41:11.240]  and the free market for what they've done well that's exactly right if you
[01:41:11.240 --> 01:41:14.520]  think of a you know a sort of a neighborhood where there's a big
[01:41:14.520 --> 01:41:17.080]  mafia the mafia goes and takes all of this money
[01:41:17.080 --> 01:41:20.840]  by threatening shopkeepers and honest workers the mafia goes and takes all of
[01:41:20.840 --> 01:41:24.440]  this money and then the mafia spends all this money on different things so
[01:41:24.440 --> 01:41:27.720]  catering and parties and and sedans or whatever
[01:41:27.720 --> 01:41:31.320]  and so a lot of businesses become dependent upon the mafia's spending
[01:41:31.320 --> 01:41:34.600]  habits and they then in a sense work to legitimize
[01:41:34.600 --> 01:41:37.960]  the mafia because that's who they become dependent on for their income
[01:41:37.960 --> 01:41:41.880]  and so what's going to happen is people really only see the businesses that
[01:41:41.880 --> 01:41:44.520]  don't see the government at the root of it and so the
[01:41:44.520 --> 01:41:47.560]  the businesses become a convenient scapegoat though i would not say
[01:41:47.560 --> 01:41:51.480]  that all businesses are entirely innocent of collusion with the state
[01:41:51.480 --> 01:41:54.360]  but yeah it's really important to remember that the the money that is
[01:41:54.360 --> 01:41:57.720]  collected and printed and manufactured and borrowed by government
[01:41:57.720 --> 01:42:02.120]  flows out into the economy and it creates a lot of you know like sharks
[01:42:02.120 --> 01:42:05.320]  have those little striped fish that hang around and pick up the bits of fish
[01:42:05.320 --> 01:42:09.480]  that they chew there's a lot of fascistic corporations hanging off
[01:42:09.480 --> 01:42:12.520]  the government's money yes government empowers those fascistic
[01:42:12.520 --> 01:42:16.280]  corporations that's why they're always lobbying to expand it
[01:42:16.280 --> 01:42:21.000]  and out of 100 largest economies almost half of them
[01:42:21.000 --> 01:42:24.760]  are not countries they're now private corporations so that's my
[01:42:24.760 --> 01:42:29.240]  issue with pure anarchist sometimes is they see a company as a company
[01:42:29.240 --> 01:42:33.240]  when they really operate as a government and then they create
[01:42:33.240 --> 01:42:37.240]  artificial clones of real moves to liberty
[01:42:37.240 --> 01:42:41.480]  they create privatization but it isn't really privatization
[01:42:41.480 --> 01:42:45.320]  it is a private group now becoming quasi-government
[01:42:45.320 --> 01:42:48.840]  well the corporations are state entities it's really important to remember
[01:42:48.840 --> 01:42:52.520]  corporations were created in the 19th century to give executives
[01:42:52.520 --> 01:42:56.600]  a lack of to exclude them from liability for what they what the company did
[01:42:56.600 --> 01:42:59.560]  and in return for this exclusion of liability
[01:42:59.560 --> 01:43:03.640]  the corporate executives agreed to pay taxes right so it's a bribe to the
[01:43:03.640 --> 01:43:06.280]  government in the form of corporate taxes
[01:43:06.280 --> 01:43:09.960]  in return for the exclusion from liability for whatever their companies do
[01:43:09.960 --> 01:43:13.240]  and that's really the fundamentals there's no such thing as a corporation
[01:43:13.240 --> 01:43:16.520]  as we currently understand it now there would be never any such thing
[01:43:16.520 --> 01:43:20.120]  without the government it is a state-created predatory monster
[01:43:20.120 --> 01:43:23.000]  but it's really really important to remember that these things would have no
[01:43:23.000 --> 01:43:25.560]  power without the violence of the state
[01:43:25.560 --> 01:43:28.840]  driving all of this money and all of this power we have to in
[01:43:28.840 --> 01:43:32.600]  innocence look past the corruptions of the corporations which is a mere
[01:43:32.600 --> 01:43:35.800]  effect of state power and look at the root of evil
[01:43:35.800 --> 01:43:39.320]  which is the gun held to the neck of the average citizen to pay taxes
[01:43:39.320 --> 01:43:43.960]  to be a tax livestock and to be obedient to send their kids to school to submit to
[01:43:43.960 --> 01:43:47.080]  authority it's the gun not the effects of the gun
[01:43:47.080 --> 01:43:49.960]  that we need to focus on well i agree with you that if you go back
[01:43:49.960 --> 01:43:53.560]  235 years ago when this country got founded
[01:43:53.560 --> 01:43:57.240]  there were no corporations and then about 160 years ago
[01:43:57.240 --> 01:44:01.160]  in a few limited cases government would want to build a bridge
[01:44:01.160 --> 01:44:05.400]  or a railroad and robber barons the carnagies the
[01:44:05.400 --> 01:44:10.440]  Rockefellers the the usual suspects on record came and said
[01:44:10.440 --> 01:44:13.640]  give us a corporation then for liability protection
[01:44:13.640 --> 01:44:17.160]  and it would only be for the life of the construction project
[01:44:17.160 --> 01:44:20.680]  now here we are with corporations that have immunity
[01:44:20.680 --> 01:44:25.320]  that have rights that never go away well yeah and look executives get to take
[01:44:25.320 --> 01:44:28.920]  the profits out of a corporation but they don't have to pay losses back into
[01:44:28.920 --> 01:44:32.680]  the corporation it's a one-way money tunnel and that of
[01:44:32.680 --> 01:44:35.800]  course is a pretty sweet deal it's the private equivalent of the federal
[01:44:35.800 --> 01:44:39.320]  reserve in that you can make money and you get to keep the winnings but if you
[01:44:39.320 --> 01:44:42.600]  lose money the the employees and the taxpayers
[01:44:42.600 --> 01:44:44.840]  sorry the employees and the stockholders are the ones who get
[01:44:44.840 --> 01:44:48.120]  shafted so again these it's really easy to to look at
[01:44:48.120 --> 01:44:50.760]  corporations because they're more visible and they're what we actually deal
[01:44:50.760 --> 01:44:53.960]  with and corporations you can also have some small effect on them through
[01:44:53.960 --> 01:44:56.120]  boycotts which you can't have through government
[01:44:56.120 --> 01:45:00.040]  but to me the problems with corporatism are a distraction
[01:45:00.040 --> 01:45:03.880]  from the real cause of it I think if you think of the sort of stream coming down
[01:45:03.880 --> 01:45:06.840]  a river there's if somebody's pouring bucket after
[01:45:06.840 --> 01:45:10.360]  bucket of pollutant or blood in the top of the stream then there's
[01:45:10.360 --> 01:45:13.480]  going to be all these problems downstream and we're always distracted by
[01:45:13.480 --> 01:45:16.120]  looking at the problems downstream and saying well how are we going to clean
[01:45:16.120 --> 01:45:18.440]  this how are we going to fix this how are we going to make this
[01:45:18.440 --> 01:45:21.880]  whole again but what we have to do is go to the source where somebody's pouring
[01:45:21.880 --> 01:45:26.520]  all this pollutant and that is the state the corporate problems are an effect
[01:45:26.520 --> 01:45:30.440]  of the monopoly of power and currency and counterfeiting that the state holds
[01:45:30.440 --> 01:45:33.800]  and it's really important not to be distracted by the effects of power and
[01:45:33.800 --> 01:45:37.880]  continue to drill down to the actual source of all of this which is the
[01:45:37.880 --> 01:45:42.120]  monopoly of force that the government has
[01:45:42.120 --> 01:45:46.120]  well I tend to agree with you but you know I'd like to give you the floor in
[01:45:46.120 --> 01:45:49.240]  the last 20 minutes or so that we've got left Stefan
[01:45:49.240 --> 01:45:52.760]  I mean I've got some other questions to get your perspective on this
[01:45:52.760 --> 01:45:56.440]  I mean how do you see this ending where do you see this going
[01:45:56.440 --> 01:46:00.760]  clearly in history governments filled with the type of
[01:46:00.760 --> 01:46:05.640]  miscreants who can only be successful within that artificial system
[01:46:05.640 --> 01:46:11.320]  go on a power mad drinking binge as you described it literally drinking
[01:46:11.320 --> 01:46:16.440]  blood you know in one way or the other sucking off their fellow
[01:46:16.440 --> 01:46:21.320]  humans they always create a stagnation where the average person just stops
[01:46:21.320 --> 01:46:24.200]  producing as their ultimate form of protest
[01:46:24.200 --> 01:46:27.480]  towards government I mean where do you see this ending I mean clearly
[01:46:27.480 --> 01:46:31.800]  government is entering the depths of insanity right now
[01:46:31.800 --> 01:46:35.240]  well it's only insanity if you're looking for sustainable income for
[01:46:35.240 --> 01:46:37.800]  society as a whole the people who are currently pillaging the
[01:46:37.800 --> 01:46:40.840]  treasury are getting millions and billions and sometimes even
[01:46:40.840 --> 01:46:43.640]  trillions of dollars which they can then live on for
[01:46:43.640 --> 01:46:48.200]  10 generations so it's only insane for society as a whole it's
[01:46:48.200 --> 01:46:52.840]  entirely sane and rational of evil but rational in terms of
[01:46:52.840 --> 01:46:55.720]  self-interest for the people who are currently controlling the money system
[01:46:55.720 --> 01:47:00.840]  and and the government so the way it's going to go in my opinion Alex is that
[01:47:00.840 --> 01:47:03.320]  I mean it's either going to get better it's going to get worse for sure and it's
[01:47:03.320 --> 01:47:05.960]  not going to get better for everyone and it's not going to get worse for everyone
[01:47:05.960 --> 01:47:09.960]  so it's a complex question again I want to reiterate to your point about
[01:47:09.960 --> 01:47:12.840]  you know people you know buying subscriptions and so on it is really
[01:47:12.840 --> 01:47:16.440]  important that we support people either directly or indirectly or become one of
[01:47:16.440 --> 01:47:20.040]  those people who are out there talking the truth to power I think it's really
[01:47:20.040 --> 01:47:22.200]  important so it is up to the actions of
[01:47:22.200 --> 01:47:26.440]  individuals that is exactly there's no inevitability in history as there is
[01:47:26.440 --> 01:47:29.480]  no inevitability in anyone's personal life it is entirely based upon the
[01:47:29.480 --> 01:47:32.040]  choices you make and the commitments that you have
[01:47:32.040 --> 01:47:35.400]  that having been said I think that what's going to happen is pretty predictable
[01:47:35.400 --> 01:47:40.440]  which is that the dependent classes are going to get the
[01:47:40.440 --> 01:47:43.880]  short end of the stick to say the least right so the people who are retiring
[01:47:43.880 --> 01:47:47.320]  the people who are dependent on welfare the people who are dependent upon
[01:47:47.320 --> 01:47:50.680]  the government largesse just at the end of the Roman Empire
[01:47:50.680 --> 01:47:54.440]  they get truly shafted and what happens is the government to you know Obama and
[01:47:54.440 --> 01:47:57.720]  people are going to get on the TV and they're going to say well
[01:47:57.720 --> 01:48:01.320]  you know this is a terrible situation the banker stole all the money
[01:48:01.320 --> 01:48:05.080]  we as the government we're just so helpless to do anything about it
[01:48:05.080 --> 01:48:08.680]  and so what we have to do together is we have to get on a war footing with
[01:48:08.680 --> 01:48:12.040]  scarcity so we have to you know all buckle down we all
[01:48:12.040 --> 01:48:14.680]  have to share the pain we're going to have to share accommodations we're
[01:48:14.680 --> 01:48:18.040]  going to have to eat cat food we're going to have to you know
[01:48:18.040 --> 01:48:21.480]  not have as much food for our pets we're going to have to eye our goldfish with
[01:48:21.480 --> 01:48:24.440]  tartar sauce we're going to have to do all of this pulling together
[01:48:24.440 --> 01:48:28.200]  and this artificial war and togetherness is going to create it it's going to be
[01:48:28.200 --> 01:48:31.160]  created because of all the scarcity that is coming
[01:48:31.160 --> 01:48:33.960]  down the pipe for the people who are dependent upon state power
[01:48:33.960 --> 01:48:37.640]  I totally agree with you by the way and we see how this is premeditated
[01:48:37.640 --> 01:48:40.760]  because they've been preparing the green austerity
[01:48:40.760 --> 01:48:43.880]  and the rationing and training the younger people
[01:48:43.880 --> 01:48:47.720]  that it's really sexy and so they're getting everyone
[01:48:47.720 --> 01:48:53.320]  prepared that it's cool to have austerity I mean if you go to whole foods
[01:48:53.320 --> 01:48:55.720]  literally every time I'm in there every few months
[01:48:55.720 --> 01:48:59.560]  half the magazines are how cool austerity is
[01:48:59.560 --> 01:49:04.760]  and how cool it is to lose your house and how bad it is to have money
[01:49:04.760 --> 01:49:08.360]  yeah so they will also then be sicked on anybody
[01:49:08.360 --> 01:49:13.240]  who's been able to not be completely destroyed by this system
[01:49:13.240 --> 01:49:17.160]  yeah the fact will always teach the hungry that starvation is a virtue
[01:49:17.160 --> 01:49:20.040]  that's how they sort of maintain themselves and some people will fall for
[01:49:20.040 --> 01:49:23.640]  this and say well you know we're now in a war against scarcity and we've all
[01:49:23.640 --> 01:49:26.360]  got to pull together but some people will simply run out of
[01:49:26.360 --> 01:49:29.160]  patience and there will be the inevitable riots and there will be the
[01:49:29.160 --> 01:49:31.640]  inevitable blockades I mean up here in Canada
[01:49:31.640 --> 01:49:36.040]  when they tried to reduce some of the farmers payouts you know these subsidies
[01:49:36.040 --> 01:49:39.240]  for farming which are so destructive to to the world economy as a whole and
[01:49:39.240 --> 01:49:42.440]  particularly to third world farmers who can't compete with free food dumped on
[01:49:42.440 --> 01:49:45.400]  their lands they tried to cut the subsidies to the
[01:49:45.400 --> 01:49:49.000]  farmers the farmers all took their tractors and drove at three miles an
[01:49:49.000 --> 01:49:51.960]  hour up and down the highways you know basically
[01:49:51.960 --> 01:49:55.480]  killing the entire economy so there is going to be
[01:49:55.480 --> 01:49:58.920]  an escalation of resistance over time there is going to be an escalation of
[01:49:58.920 --> 01:50:03.480]  violence that it's too late to prevent that in my opinion but what we can do
[01:50:03.480 --> 01:50:07.240]  is basically once the gun comes out of the holster
[01:50:07.240 --> 01:50:10.760]  it's going to be a lot more evident to people when we've been saying for years
[01:50:10.760 --> 01:50:13.160]  and years and decades and decades when we've been saying
[01:50:13.160 --> 01:50:16.440]  there's a gun in the room that you don't see it's not a social contract it's
[01:50:16.440 --> 01:50:20.200]  livestock you are expendable you are owned you are
[01:50:20.200 --> 01:50:24.040]  harvested like a crop it sounds nutty when
[01:50:24.040 --> 01:50:27.720]  people see Obama giving handshakes and being charismatic and presentable and
[01:50:27.720 --> 01:50:32.040]  wearing a suit and not fatigues but when the guns come out
[01:50:32.040 --> 01:50:35.400]  as they're going to come out when the dependent classes rise up against
[01:50:35.400 --> 01:50:39.160]  this scarcity when the guns comes out not only will people see the gun in the
[01:50:39.160 --> 01:50:42.200]  room that we've always been talking about but the fact that we've always been
[01:50:42.200 --> 01:50:44.920]  talking about it and now it comes gives us a kind of
[01:50:44.920 --> 01:50:49.240]  credibility that can really help and by the way they're already
[01:50:49.240 --> 01:50:52.920]  training us that when the gun comes out it's for al-qaeda
[01:50:52.920 --> 01:50:56.760]  but then when we get the internal documents it's all about us this whole
[01:50:56.760 --> 01:51:01.080]  grid is for all of us we'll be right back
[01:51:01.080 --> 01:51:04.600]  hi this is alex jones did you know that the global elite are now storing
[01:51:04.600 --> 01:51:07.960]  non-hybrid seeds and secret storage vaults near the arctic circle
[01:51:07.960 --> 01:51:11.320]  did you know that in a real meltdown non-hybrid seeds could become more
[01:51:11.320 --> 01:51:14.520]  valuable than silver or gold it's true seeds about perform even
[01:51:14.520 --> 01:51:17.480]  gold and silver before in this country and it's possible that could even
[01:51:17.480 --> 01:51:20.120]  happen again so our friends at solutions from
[01:51:20.120 --> 01:51:23.800]  science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds
[01:51:23.800 --> 01:51:27.320]  they call it a survival seed bank and it can produce

[01:53:46.600 --> 01:53:50.280]  hi ted anderson i'm placing a silver dollar in a book explains our monetary

[01:54:10.760 --> 01:54:15.080]  we're going into very serious times but i'm kind of looking forward to it
[01:54:15.080 --> 01:54:19.960]  this slow rotting this marination in this
[01:54:19.960 --> 01:54:25.880]  false reality that only big government can create has made us weak
[01:54:25.880 --> 01:54:29.960]  and we don't really learn about our medal until we get tested
[01:54:29.960 --> 01:54:35.640]  the drudge report is top-linked in red to our story i was just over visiting
[01:54:35.640 --> 01:54:40.040]  drudgereport.com and looking at these stories about
[01:54:40.040 --> 01:54:48.520]  hundreds of youth running around rioting inside of
[01:54:48.520 --> 01:54:52.760]  a mall and gunshots outside and now the news is
[01:54:52.760 --> 01:54:56.120]  and the police are saying it may have been organized on the internet
[01:54:56.120 --> 01:55:00.440]  oh so the government needs to censor the web now
[01:55:00.440 --> 01:55:04.920]  how about using social media for flash mobs for liberty and freedom
[01:55:04.920 --> 01:55:09.000]  not for lawlessness but i was over there looking at those stories i was going to
[01:55:09.000 --> 01:55:14.680]  cover next hour after our guest leaves us and you know
[01:55:14.680 --> 01:55:19.640]  dead fish cover 20 miles of arkansas river thousands of birds fall from sky
[01:55:19.640 --> 01:55:22.360]  connected to government testing question mark
[01:55:22.360 --> 01:55:26.440]  and and my only issue as i said earlier if government's always been
[01:55:26.440 --> 01:55:31.480]  doing this over and over again why isn't government being looked at
[01:55:31.480 --> 01:55:35.000]  going back to that question from earlier stefan because i really want your
[01:55:35.000 --> 01:55:40.760]  insightful view on this why does anyone trust or like government
[01:55:40.760 --> 01:55:44.200]  when government is the author of almost all major crimes
[01:55:44.200 --> 01:55:48.520]  the only author of giant mass murder in the hundreds of thousands and millions
[01:55:48.520 --> 01:55:52.040]  when every major government is constantly caught
[01:55:52.040 --> 01:55:56.040]  testing deadly chemical biologicals and radiologicals
[01:55:56.040 --> 01:56:01.720]  on populations a why does the public uh through i guess some kind of uh
[01:56:01.720 --> 01:56:05.720]  what's the psychological disorder uh where people love their abusers
[01:56:05.720 --> 01:56:09.240]  well Stockholm syndrome the stock i mean is it Stockholm syndrome uh
[01:56:09.240 --> 01:56:14.920]  history uh or or or or uh Stockholm by uh by proxy uh
[01:56:14.920 --> 01:56:19.000]  or uh well i mean there's that question as i'm ranting here
[01:56:19.000 --> 01:56:24.840]  but then also why does government again spend the same type of web every time
[01:56:24.840 --> 01:56:29.400]  well i think that's a really essential question because the fundamentals of
[01:56:29.400 --> 01:56:31.480]  what we're talking about in the freedom movement
[01:56:31.480 --> 01:56:37.080]  are so simple it's so simple uh it is like saying stealing is bad
[01:56:37.080 --> 01:56:40.200]  violence is bad except in self-defense this is
[01:56:40.200 --> 01:56:43.480]  kindergarten morality right don't hit don't steal don't punch
[01:56:43.480 --> 01:56:46.840]  and keep your word everything we're talking about is so simple
[01:56:46.840 --> 01:56:49.640]  it's not like we're trying to convince pygmies of Einstein's theory of
[01:56:49.640 --> 01:56:53.320]  relativity we're talking about very very simple things here and the question
[01:56:53.320 --> 01:56:57.400]  i've always struggled with Alice is why is it so hard for people to understand
[01:56:57.400 --> 01:57:00.840]  these basic things and i think that's a couple answers i'll just touch on
[01:57:00.840 --> 01:57:04.120]  briefly here i don't claim to have a monopoly on the answers but the first
[01:57:04.120 --> 01:57:07.240]  is of course the Stockholm syndrome that the government raises
[01:57:07.240 --> 01:57:09.960]  most people uh they spend more time with the government than they do with their
[01:57:09.960 --> 01:57:12.280]  parents than they do with their community
[01:57:12.280 --> 01:57:16.200]  and so what happens is uh they end up loving
[01:57:16.200 --> 01:57:19.880]  the government so to speak they end up attached to this authority figure that
[01:57:19.880 --> 01:57:24.120]  they imprinted upon it's like you see those ducks uh in nature shows that
[01:57:24.120 --> 01:57:27.640]  imprint upon an orange balloon and then they just follow that balloon around
[01:57:27.640 --> 01:57:30.600]  it's just an imprint instead they've uh imprinted on the blood
[01:57:30.600 --> 01:57:35.080]  ranking slog well sure except they don't they see it as a guardian angel of an
[01:57:35.080 --> 01:57:36.760]  effort right so i think that's the first thing
[01:57:36.760 --> 01:57:40.040]  i think i think the second thing is that people
[01:57:40.040 --> 01:57:45.080]  don't like to try to reduce power because then they'll find out that they
[01:57:45.080 --> 01:57:49.080]  can't right so uh even sam harris uh who seems
[01:57:49.080 --> 01:57:52.680]  a scientist and a rationalist is talking for you know increased government
[01:57:52.680 --> 01:57:55.080]  power in the economy and a world government and so on
[01:57:55.080 --> 01:57:58.120]  and why are they doing that because people like to feel like they're having
[01:57:58.120 --> 01:58:02.120]  an effect on changing things and every time you go to the government and say
[01:58:02.120 --> 01:58:06.280]  i think you should have more power the government says i'm with you man i'm with
[01:58:06.280 --> 01:58:10.120]  you brother 150 that's a great idea and then things change you want to pass
[01:58:10.120 --> 01:58:13.320]  another law you want to raise a new tax you want to punish someone else
[01:58:13.320 --> 01:58:17.480]  that all works so people like getting behind that uh tank rolling down the
[01:58:17.480 --> 01:58:20.440]  hill and pushing it because they feel like that having some effect you try and
[01:58:20.440 --> 01:58:24.040]  reduce the power of government you'll realize just how little power you really
[01:58:24.040 --> 01:58:28.200]  happen to fight very well said and the social
[01:58:28.200 --> 01:58:33.240]  engineers are masters at steering that foaming at the mouth mob that the
[01:58:33.240 --> 01:58:37.880]  founding fathers warned us about so much uh we'll be right back in 60 seconds

[01:58:45.480 --> 01:58:50.840]  on demand we are the gcn radio network
[01:58:50.840 --> 01:58:54.920]  a very wealthy u.s citizen is predicting that in 2011
[01:58:54.920 --> 01:58:59.000]  we will witness the most important day in america in more than 50 years
[01:58:59.000 --> 01:59:02.760]  he says it will change everything about our lives the way you shop travel

[01:59:09.960 --> 01:59:14.600]  the crazy part is he's usually right you see he predicted the collapse of gm
[01:59:14.600 --> 01:59:17.800]  fanny may friday mac and america's biggest small owner general growth
[01:59:17.800 --> 01:59:22.600]  properties in fact barons called his work a dire prophecy recently he
[01:59:22.600 --> 01:59:26.200]  created a video which you can watch online for free detailing his biggest and
[01:59:26.200 --> 01:59:29.240]  most important prediction yet and it's a real eye opener
[01:59:29.240 --> 01:59:32.920]  i can't stress this enough you should at least watch this free video online
[01:59:32.920 --> 01:59:35.000]  today he explains everything you need to know

[02:00:05.560 --> 02:00:11.960]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers
[02:00:11.960 --> 02:00:18.600]  well so does he he's alex jones on the gcm radio network and now
[02:00:18.600 --> 02:00:24.600]  live from austin texas alex jones
[02:00:24.600 --> 02:00:28.920]  stefan mono new is our guest author researcher
[02:00:28.920 --> 02:00:32.840]  we're gonna talk to stefan for 10 hours got a bunch of economic news
[02:00:32.840 --> 02:00:37.720]  geopolitical news environmental news a lot of hardcore information coming up
[02:00:37.720 --> 02:00:41.160]  and i've also got a list of points i want to go over before this next
[02:00:41.160 --> 02:00:44.520]  hour ends but the four minutes we've got left stefan i want to thank you for
[02:00:44.520 --> 02:00:48.760]  joining us a b other points that you see on the
[02:00:48.760 --> 02:00:53.960]  horizon for 2011 do you think that the awakening
[02:00:53.960 --> 02:00:58.040]  that i mean that that we can really say 2010 was the year of the awakening
[02:00:58.040 --> 02:01:01.960]  or do you think i'm wrong on that point i think
[02:01:01.960 --> 02:01:06.840]  that we are still in the process of awakening obviously it's not a sort of
[02:01:06.840 --> 02:01:10.120]  bookended black and white deal i think that the amount of energy
[02:01:10.120 --> 02:01:13.480]  that we need to pursue that we need to invest in waking people up
[02:01:13.480 --> 02:01:17.560]  isn't has never been greater i think 2011 is going to be a make or break year
[02:01:17.560 --> 02:01:21.400]  i mean there is obviously momentum in the downward movement we need to try and
[02:01:21.400 --> 02:01:26.280]  get people to wake up on the plus side people are getting enough
[02:01:26.280 --> 02:01:30.360]  empirical evidence and emotional uneasiness
[02:01:30.360 --> 02:01:33.960]  about where the system is everybody gets deep down
[02:01:33.960 --> 02:01:38.040]  that the current system is completely unsustainable particularly but the
[02:01:38.040 --> 02:01:42.200]  explosion in astounding deficits over the past two two years
[02:01:42.200 --> 02:01:45.720]  there is always really since the war but since the wars began
[02:01:45.720 --> 02:01:49.160]  so people get mathematically fundamentally you don't have to be a
[02:01:49.160 --> 02:01:51.720]  phd in mathematics to know that we are in a completely
[02:01:51.720 --> 02:01:55.240]  unsustainable situation everybody understands this
[02:01:55.240 --> 02:01:59.000]  the unemployed tragic though it is it is a wake-up call
[02:01:59.000 --> 02:02:01.640]  you know the system is no longer working for you
[02:02:01.640 --> 02:02:04.600]  middle-class incomes have stagnated or declined
[02:02:04.600 --> 02:02:09.640]  since the 1970s since we went off the residuals of the gold standard
[02:02:09.640 --> 02:02:13.400]  and which is entirely predictable people get that the dollar has lost over 90%
[02:02:13.400 --> 02:02:16.920]  of its value since the phd came in ron paul in talking about
[02:02:16.920 --> 02:02:20.280]  auditing the phd is waking people up to the fact that they
[02:02:20.280 --> 02:02:24.680]  swim in this ocean of fantasy money which is
[02:02:24.680 --> 02:02:28.840]  leading away their resources so the fact is there's so much evidence
[02:02:28.840 --> 02:02:35.400]  that we're not talking about a an island over the horizon that we're afraid of
[02:02:35.400 --> 02:02:38.360]  hitting where it's within sight it's right we're here and that was the
[02:02:38.360 --> 02:02:42.280]  point i was trying to make i mean to quantify it
[02:02:42.280 --> 02:02:47.560]  i'm saying i see 2010 as the time when the momentum began to shift
[02:02:47.560 --> 02:02:50.840]  and i saw a greater amount of awakening in that one year
[02:02:50.840 --> 02:02:55.400]  than i'd seen in the previous 10 so i see that as a quantum acceleration
[02:02:55.400 --> 02:02:59.400]  but also i see the gun coming out of the holster as you said
[02:02:59.400 --> 02:03:02.840]  where the secretary of defense openly says last week
[02:03:02.840 --> 02:03:07.480]  i don't care what the american people want or if 65 percent are against the
[02:03:07.480 --> 02:03:11.640]  afghan war it's going to continue i mean they're really being more brazen
[02:03:11.640 --> 02:03:15.160]  yeah and what if we always heard if you if you have nothing to hide you
[02:03:15.160 --> 02:03:18.760]  should not be afraid of scrutiny well of course with wiki leaks we can turn
[02:03:18.760 --> 02:03:21.720]  that exact same question back to the government and say if you have nothing
[02:03:21.720 --> 02:03:25.000]  to hide why are you afraid of some scrutiny and the government can of
[02:03:25.000 --> 02:03:27.400]  course rifle through our bank accounts and our internet
[02:03:27.400 --> 02:03:31.160]  activities and and our health records and anything else that you could imagine
[02:03:31.160 --> 02:03:34.920]  our tax records but the moment we turn that light back on the government
[02:03:34.920 --> 02:03:38.920]  they start calling for the assassination of a foreign national who has broken
[02:03:38.920 --> 02:03:42.280]  no u.s laws they're calling for a hit this is
[02:03:42.280 --> 02:03:45.960]  something out of a mafia movie and it's gone without
[02:03:45.960 --> 02:03:50.280]  significant comment in the mainstream media a hit has been called out for
[02:03:50.280 --> 02:03:54.760]  on julian assange that is kind of a a thing that once you see it and once you
[02:03:54.760 --> 02:03:58.200]  point it out you can't really go back to the cuddly government that's just
[02:03:58.200 --> 02:04:01.480]  interested in protecting you from from dangerous people overseas
[02:04:01.480 --> 02:04:06.120]  so i think that the the violence the hysteria the aggression the panic
[02:04:06.120 --> 02:04:08.920]  and the disasters are accumulating to such a degree
[02:04:08.920 --> 02:04:12.280]  that when you say the system is fundamentally broken
[02:04:12.280 --> 02:04:16.040]  people will agree now when you say it's fundamentally unrepairable
[02:04:16.040 --> 02:04:19.560]  people still have a problem but at least they know that something has to change
[02:04:19.560 --> 02:04:22.440]  and they also don't want it to change for the worst we still have enough
[02:04:22.440 --> 02:04:26.760]  residual of classical liberalism of libertarianism of
[02:04:26.760 --> 02:04:30.200]  you could say even the ancient greek devotion to personal liberty
[02:04:30.200 --> 02:04:34.360]  we have enough of that residual left that we can still turn it around but we
[02:04:34.360 --> 02:04:39.240]  really have to get behind this wheel and push and push and push
[02:04:39.240 --> 02:04:42.920]  stefan malinou i want to do three four minutes with the only other side
[02:04:42.920 --> 02:04:46.440]  because i want you to really be able to boil down
[02:04:46.440 --> 02:04:51.000]  your political view because when you you call yourself a classical liberal
[02:04:51.000 --> 02:04:54.040]  that's what i call myself a modern conservative
[02:04:54.040 --> 02:04:58.040]  will think then that we're communists i mean they've really changed the terms
[02:04:58.040 --> 02:05:01.960]  so i want to get down to terms and language folks you've heard us talk

[02:06:03.320 --> 02:06:07.320]  solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily
[02:06:07.320 --> 02:06:09.800]  double or triple your electric bill number two
[02:06:09.800 --> 02:06:13.640]  our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company
[02:06:13.640 --> 02:06:16.840]  allows you to have it's true total government control of
[02:06:16.840 --> 02:06:20.360]  electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming
[02:06:20.360 --> 02:06:24.040]  number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously
[02:06:24.040 --> 02:06:27.080]  overloaded and now new socialist legislation
[02:06:27.080 --> 02:06:30.920]  is only compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a
[02:06:30.920 --> 02:06:34.520]  threat to local grids every year thousands of families lose their power
[02:06:34.520 --> 02:06:38.440]  from weather related onages number five a solar power generator provides
[02:06:38.440 --> 02:06:42.200]  powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks i really believe in the solar
[02:06:42.200 --> 02:06:45.880]  power generators offered by solutions from science one of my oldest sponsors

[02:07:01.240 --> 02:07:05.240]  hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone
[02:07:05.240 --> 02:07:08.440]  this is our last chance to not relive history
[02:07:08.440 --> 02:07:12.440]  as we're finishing off this agenda that we're pulling the rug from underneath
[02:07:12.440 --> 02:07:15.640]  americans at home i've turned a tremendous influence
[02:07:15.640 --> 02:07:19.640]  on our president in congress and they really are calling the shots
[02:07:19.640 --> 02:07:24.920]  i think it's incumbent upon all of us as american citizens to pay attention
[02:07:24.920 --> 02:07:28.840]  fall of the republic identifies the enemies of our nation the criminal
[02:07:28.840 --> 02:07:32.520]  offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty
[02:07:32.520 --> 02:07:35.800]  and on its ashes constructing world government tim geithner
[02:07:35.800 --> 02:07:38.840]  Bernanke the arsonists they're asking for more matches
[02:07:38.840 --> 02:07:42.200]  and the congress is saying who do we make the checkout to today seems like
[02:07:42.200 --> 02:07:45.720]  nobody does care and right now in washington dc
[02:07:45.720 --> 02:07:50.920]  we have seen a fall of the republic yet your copy of fall of the republic on
[02:07:50.920 --> 02:07:56.120]  dvd at info wars dot com we're watching online right now in super high
[02:07:56.120 --> 02:08:05.720]  quality at prison planet dot tv
[02:08:05.720 --> 02:08:10.440]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups
[02:08:10.440 --> 02:08:17.800]  you want answers well so does he he's alex jones on the gcn radio network

[02:08:26.760 --> 02:08:30.440]  all right stefan molyneux our guests are just a few more minutes
[02:08:30.440 --> 02:08:34.280]  and then we're going to get into the economy this mattering of other really
[02:08:34.280 --> 02:08:37.880]  important news including uh these reports that are
[02:08:37.880 --> 02:08:41.160]  up on the drugs report in fact guys i hit print on these we grab another printer
[02:08:41.160 --> 02:08:45.640]  for me thank you uh 100 young people ransacked
[02:08:45.640 --> 02:08:49.480]  store mall clothes tumult
[02:08:49.480 --> 02:08:56.040]  uh plan promoted on social media sites uh there's also just all sorts of
[02:08:56.040 --> 02:08:59.800]  unrest and craziness increasing all over the world
[02:08:59.800 --> 02:09:06.120]  drudge is also linked to our story uh asking are the
[02:09:06.120 --> 02:09:10.040]  20 miles of dead fish and the thousands of dead birds raining on the sky
[02:09:10.040 --> 02:09:13.400]  connected to government testing well that'd be my number one guest that's our
[02:09:13.400 --> 02:09:15.960]  number one suspects i mean if government's just
[02:09:15.960 --> 02:09:20.280]  engaged in secret radiological chemical biological testing
[02:09:20.280 --> 02:09:23.800]  over and over and over again then why would we not look at them
[02:09:23.800 --> 02:09:27.640]  as the number one culprit uh but going back to stefan
[02:09:27.640 --> 02:09:30.920]  and if he just joined us uh he's an author he's written on truth
[02:09:30.920 --> 02:09:34.760]  tyranny of illusion uh universally preferable behavior
[02:09:34.760 --> 02:09:39.000]  irrational proof of secular ethics real-time relationships
[02:09:39.000 --> 02:09:44.120]  logic love everyday anarchy it goes on from there and the websites of freedom
[02:09:44.120 --> 02:09:48.280]  domain radio dot com our websites of course are info wars dot com and
[02:09:48.280 --> 02:09:53.320]  prison planet dot tv but again if you read 1984
[02:09:53.320 --> 02:09:57.480]  he was just covering and and and and you know putting down in fiction what he'd
[02:09:57.480 --> 02:10:01.000]  already witnessed working for government working for communist
[02:10:01.000 --> 02:10:05.000]  working for bbc working for the imperial police in india
[02:10:05.000 --> 02:10:09.880]  and george arwell aka eric blair our vice versa
[02:10:09.880 --> 02:10:13.640]  you know he wrote about destroying the language reducing it down
[02:10:13.640 --> 02:10:18.440]  to where basically humans just make noise you know five or six noises like a
[02:10:18.440 --> 02:10:22.600]  chimpanzee or or like a cow and now i see the studies out all
[02:10:22.600 --> 02:10:27.080]  over the world the language is shrinking people can't communicate
[02:10:27.080 --> 02:10:31.560]  they take it as threatening if you can form complex ideas
[02:10:31.560 --> 02:10:35.160]  but i don't think humanity is irrevocably broken but when you say
[02:10:35.160 --> 02:10:38.920]  something like you know a classical liberal the average dumb
[02:10:38.920 --> 02:10:42.360]  down mainline conservative who isn't conservative at all
[02:10:42.360 --> 02:10:46.520]  they love the big defense budgets they love it all uh they think that means
[02:10:46.520 --> 02:10:50.280]  you're saying you're a communist when a classical liberal is the opposite
[02:10:50.280 --> 02:10:53.800]  aren't they there's no word left that hasn't been
[02:10:53.800 --> 02:10:57.640]  polluted by statism through which you can describe
[02:10:57.640 --> 02:11:02.040]  yourself as a freedom lover so if you say well i'm a pacifist and that i oppose
[02:11:02.040 --> 02:11:05.560]  the initiation of force then people think that you just want to lie down and
[02:11:05.560 --> 02:11:09.240]  have people go through your pockets and you're not in self-defense so you can't
[02:11:09.240 --> 02:11:14.360]  use that uh you can't use uh anarchists uh because then people associate that
[02:11:14.360 --> 02:11:18.360]  with idiots throwing bombs in malls as you say and there's not any particular
[02:11:18.360 --> 02:11:21.400]  coherence to that even though people like domchansky can call themselves
[02:11:21.400 --> 02:11:24.520]  anarchists that's just not how the media portrays it if you call yourself a
[02:11:24.520 --> 02:11:27.560]  liberal people think that you're into big government programs if people
[02:11:27.560 --> 02:11:30.360]  think you're if you're a conservative then people think that you want government
[02:11:30.360 --> 02:11:34.680]  to restrict gay marriage or whatever so we've really been crowded out at the
[02:11:34.680 --> 02:11:37.560]  discourse and which is why i simply say i'm a
[02:11:37.560 --> 02:11:41.080]  philosopher there are certain conclusions that i accept as a result of the
[02:11:41.080 --> 02:11:45.640]  rational application of philosophy so i try not to describe my conclusions
[02:11:45.640 --> 02:11:48.440]  because i don't want to be identified by the conclusions like if you're a
[02:11:48.440 --> 02:11:51.720]  biologist you don't say well i'm a Darwinist right you just say well i
[02:11:51.720 --> 02:11:55.160]  accept certain theories of evolution that's scientifically valid or whatever
[02:11:55.160 --> 02:11:59.240]  so you don't want to i think i really try to avoid identifying myself
[02:11:59.240 --> 02:12:03.640]  by my conclusions right that i accept that a state and society is the only
[02:12:03.640 --> 02:12:07.080]  rational and consistent application of the non-aggression principle there's no
[02:12:07.080 --> 02:12:11.320]  group of human beings that you can fence off and give virtually limitless power
[02:12:11.320 --> 02:12:16.120]  to and not have it turn out badly i mean that's just not a good idea at all
[02:12:16.120 --> 02:12:18.920]  it's not how people organize neighborhood locks like if they want to
[02:12:18.920 --> 02:12:23.240]  protect their neighborhood they don't just give a tank and and a bomber and
[02:12:23.240 --> 02:12:26.680]  an army to some guy on the street corner and say well you take care of it all
[02:12:26.680 --> 02:12:29.800]  because they know that that's going to act bad and end up badly
[02:12:29.800 --> 02:12:33.720]  so i try to avoid conclusions what i try to do is to
[02:12:33.720 --> 02:12:37.080]  say well i'm a philosopher i accept reason i accept evidence
[02:12:37.080 --> 02:12:41.480]  and therefore uh this is where it leads and hopefully people will start
[02:12:41.480 --> 02:12:44.600]  thinking along those lines but yeah you're right there's no word left that you
[02:12:44.600 --> 02:12:47.640]  can describe to say what are you as i don't know carbon-based life forms the
[02:12:47.640 --> 02:12:50.840]  best i can come up with so uh you're right the language has been
[02:12:50.840 --> 02:12:54.520]  really polluted and that is a great challenge for people
[02:12:54.520 --> 02:12:59.080]  i mean i find myself every day i say i'm exposing the left right paradigm
[02:12:59.080 --> 02:13:02.920]  because if you can shatter that and show how they divide us from each other
[02:13:02.920 --> 02:13:06.440]  so we can be played off against each other instead of going after the actual
[02:13:06.440 --> 02:13:09.480]  social engineers those that seek to limit knowledge
[02:13:09.480 --> 02:13:12.840]  those that seek to dumb us down so we're more easily managed
[02:13:12.840 --> 02:13:17.080]  uh but then to even communicate with the general public
[02:13:17.080 --> 02:13:21.960]  i have to use left right paradigm terms to then even introduce them
[02:13:21.960 --> 02:13:25.960]  to new ideas and again i don't even claim to have that sophisticated of a
[02:13:25.960 --> 02:13:29.480]  worldview i just know the direction we're going in
[02:13:29.480 --> 02:13:35.480]  uh is absolutely uh destructive by any historical common sense
[02:13:35.480 --> 02:13:40.680]  philosophical perspective stefan it was great talking to you i look
[02:13:40.680 --> 02:13:43.160]  forward to talking to you again in the near future good to have you hear
[02:13:43.160 --> 02:13:47.320]  where this is one of the first guests in 2011 thank you so much alexander very
[02:13:47.320 --> 02:13:51.000]  happy new year to you and to all of your guests and let's make this the
[02:13:51.000 --> 02:13:54.760]  year where we gain real traction and begin to really turn this thing around
[02:13:54.760 --> 02:13:57.560]  in a powerful way and it's really important that people
[02:13:57.560 --> 02:14:01.000]  act decisively and concertedly and intelligently
[02:14:01.000 --> 02:14:04.520]  because if it's not us who is it going to be and if it's not now
[02:14:04.520 --> 02:14:07.880]  when is it going to be the time running out so thank you so much for the uh
[02:14:07.880 --> 02:14:11.320]  the conversation i really do appreciate it stefan great having you with us as
[02:14:11.320 --> 02:14:15.480]  john conner says if you're listening to my voice you are the resistance
[02:14:15.480 --> 02:14:19.160]  look in the mirror folks that's who's going to fix it and hollywood puts these
[02:14:19.160 --> 02:14:22.600]  archetypes in our minds that it's got to be an arnold schwarzzenegger
[02:14:22.600 --> 02:14:26.040]  or you know some type of atlas character some type
[02:14:26.040 --> 02:14:29.960]  of you know all powerful uh hercules archetype
[02:14:29.960 --> 02:14:38.120]  that is going to vanquish the slathering uh uh hydra that's not how it works
[02:14:38.120 --> 02:14:43.240]  it starts small little steps little things but almost harmonically just
[02:14:43.240 --> 02:14:47.960]  continuing to push forward continuing it i mean look how
[02:14:47.960 --> 02:14:51.320]  powerful it is if a woman keeps him pecking you ladies and gentlemen
[02:14:51.320 --> 02:14:55.320]  i mean that's basically what it's like is is billions of us just
[02:14:55.320 --> 02:14:58.520]  just pecking you know death by a trillion cuts
[02:14:58.520 --> 02:15:03.240]  on the globalist and what cuts them is pulling them down not worshiping them
[02:15:03.240 --> 02:15:07.240]  pointing out how ridiculous they are pointing out how corrupt they are
[02:15:07.240 --> 02:15:10.920]  pointing out how destructive they are pointing out how much hypocrisy they
[02:15:10.920 --> 02:15:14.440]  have and first it's just getting past your fear not being in awe
[02:15:14.440 --> 02:15:18.280]  you're a government you know person in a toilet attendant uniform
[02:15:18.280 --> 02:15:24.040]  i will fall down and worship you no no no no you're some corporate chief
[02:15:24.040 --> 02:15:28.440]  i'm not going to fall down and worship you okay now i wanted to get into
[02:15:28.440 --> 02:15:31.160]  economic news and i got some really serious news
[02:15:31.160 --> 02:15:34.200]  that i that i've known has been going on for about a month
[02:15:34.200 --> 02:15:39.400]  along with other censorship but that i wasn't a hundred percent sure of but
[02:15:39.400 --> 02:15:43.560]  now we've done our own test i've talked to family that saved it
[02:15:43.560 --> 02:15:47.480]  uh i've talked to others and the emails i mean
[02:15:47.480 --> 02:15:50.600]  just jaren saw two this morning without even looking
[02:15:50.600 --> 02:15:54.840]  i mean they're just pouring into this office
[02:15:54.840 --> 02:15:58.600]  and it deals with conspiracy theory with jessie ventura and there's no doubt
[02:15:58.600 --> 02:16:02.440]  there's a new level there's actually three levels of censorship
[02:16:02.440 --> 02:16:06.440]  we've only covered one here i want to cover the second and third layer of the
[02:16:06.440 --> 02:16:09.000]  cake we kept saying i can't believe this made it on
[02:16:09.000 --> 02:16:12.200]  air i can't believe that that well it didn't okay
[02:16:12.200 --> 02:16:16.520]  it didn't they're phasing it out they've banned shows and now it's gotten worse
[02:16:16.520 --> 02:16:19.800]  uh and that shows you the truth is effective with the globalist i think
[02:16:19.800 --> 02:16:23.640]  the globalist kind of arrogantly said let it on it's too late for them anyways
[02:16:23.640 --> 02:16:26.520]  they don't care but then they saw the top ratings well
[02:16:26.520 --> 02:16:29.240]  i'll tell the whole story in the next segment
[02:16:29.240 --> 02:16:32.360]  and i got some other important news i want to cover and i got an interesting
[02:16:32.360 --> 02:16:35.960]  video we're going to be playing here as well but before we go any further i
[02:16:35.960 --> 02:16:40.200]  played back at the start of the last hour uh george soros from a year ago in the
[02:16:40.200 --> 02:16:42.840]  financial times of london website a video interview
[02:16:42.840 --> 02:16:46.360]  saying we got to get rid of the u.s dollar slowly we got to bring in global
[02:16:46.360 --> 02:16:49.320]  government we got to bring in a global government currency
[02:16:49.320 --> 02:16:52.840]  he talked about how that would be done how china needs to be the owner of the
[02:16:52.840 --> 02:16:55.560]  us and now they are the biggest owner of our
[02:16:55.560 --> 02:16:58.920]  debt next to private fellow reserve i mean you can see the
[02:16:58.920 --> 02:17:04.600]  method of their madness and then it continues china back spain
[02:17:04.600 --> 02:17:07.560]  to emerge from crisis that's city morning herald
[02:17:07.560 --> 02:17:13.400]  china is now buying up europe foreign banks are buying up greece
[02:17:13.400 --> 02:17:18.760]  it's all done through fraud u.s yield spread falls below the rest of the
[02:17:18.760 --> 02:17:22.280]  world now foreigners don't want u.s corporations and
[02:17:22.280 --> 02:17:26.040]  u.s government treasury notes that's out of bloomberg
[02:17:26.040 --> 02:17:29.000]  very serious developments and sure enough
[02:17:29.000 --> 02:17:33.400]  silver well above 30 dollars an ounce i wanted to bring ted anderson up with a
[02:17:33.400 --> 02:17:36.920]  silver update we're unable to get keiser on friday with phone
[02:17:36.920 --> 02:17:39.320]  problems uh but we're gonna get keiser on the next
[02:17:39.320 --> 02:17:43.080]  few days of the silver update ted give us an update on silver
[02:17:43.080 --> 02:17:45.800]  hurtling towards an all-time record right now
[02:17:45.800 --> 02:17:49.960]  well it sure is alex i mean right now silver's seen a peak today of 31 dollars
[02:17:49.960 --> 02:17:54.680]  and 22 cents an ounce uh last time i was on the air with you alex it was
[02:17:54.680 --> 02:18:00.200]  silver was 22 times more expensive 22 times more expensive
[02:18:00.200 --> 02:18:04.440]  than silver was back when silver was used as money here in the united states
[02:18:04.440 --> 02:18:09.640]  that only dates back to 1964 really the separation in 1971
[02:18:09.640 --> 02:18:14.920]  now we are 24 times as much money as it used to take when we had constitutional
[02:18:14.920 --> 02:18:17.480]  money here it all reflects what's going on
[02:18:17.480 --> 02:18:21.400]  with the united states dollar and how fast it's falling i mean you
[02:18:21.400 --> 02:18:25.640]  just today the fed stepped in and bought 7.79
[02:18:25.640 --> 02:18:29.480]  billion more dollars of us treasuries to help fill that
[02:18:29.480 --> 02:18:34.440]  mandate of 600 uh billion dollars by the by june and to put that in layman's
[02:18:34.440 --> 02:18:39.640]  term the zimbabwean waimarian acceleration towards
[02:18:39.640 --> 02:18:42.760]  you've seen 90 plus percent evaluation in the dollar
[02:18:42.760 --> 02:18:47.480]  in the last 97 years now in the next year you're going to see
[02:18:47.480 --> 02:18:51.480]  you know the the final 10 percent run out yep and that's right alex and you
[02:18:51.480 --> 02:18:54.680]  know what you think that the us that the that the federal reserve would buy it
[02:18:54.680 --> 02:18:58.360]  from the treasury but they're not they're buying it through goldman sacks
[02:18:58.360 --> 02:19:01.880]  they're buying through jp morgan that way they get a profit i mean it's just
[02:19:01.880 --> 02:19:05.080]  total swindling it is i mean they're taking our money and
[02:19:05.080 --> 02:19:08.120]  they're just cheating us and then they charge us interest and they're just
[02:19:08.120 --> 02:19:11.720]  driving us right into the toilet and and and the silver's reflecting it it's
[02:19:11.720 --> 02:19:15.400]  obvious let me stop you let me stop you you bought a mega
[02:19:15.400 --> 02:19:18.920]  massive amount of silver when they drove it down to 27
[02:19:18.920 --> 02:19:23.320]  how long till you run out of the silver halves and silver round one ounces
[02:19:23.320 --> 02:19:26.600]  how long before you've got to go up to the 31 dollar level
[02:19:26.600 --> 02:19:30.120]  well alex i can tell you what i'm holding my prices till midnight tonight i
[02:19:30.120 --> 02:19:35.880]  think one of the best buys out there is 2415 for that survival bag of dimes

[02:24:24.600 --> 02:24:30.200]  15 or so examples of declassified u.s. government chemical biological testing
[02:24:30.200 --> 02:24:33.240]  on the american people but i'm going to get watson to add
[02:24:33.240 --> 02:24:38.120]  projects shad that went into the 1990s uh examples of us and british troops
[02:24:38.120 --> 02:24:41.880]  being nerve-gassed there's a lot of other hardcore examples especially now
[02:24:41.880 --> 02:24:44.920]  because the drudge report is linked to it in red
[02:24:44.920 --> 02:24:48.360]  this is a great chance to educate people we've also got in-game
[02:24:48.360 --> 02:24:52.040]  blueprint for global enslavement posted the full film for free
[02:24:52.040 --> 02:24:56.280]  at the bottom of it so all these people that aren't aware of this can get informed
[02:24:56.280 --> 02:24:59.240]  we do need to add a description though of in-game
[02:24:59.240 --> 02:25:02.600]  as a history of government you know lethal testing
[02:25:02.600 --> 02:25:06.040]  so that people know what they're about to see so i'm trying to get a hold of
[02:25:06.040 --> 02:25:09.400]  watson right now so i'm intercoming him on the radio live
[02:25:09.400 --> 02:25:13.080]  so we can get some of that stuff added to it in fact
[02:25:13.080 --> 02:25:17.080]  send your mainstream news articles about declassified chemical and biological
[02:25:17.080 --> 02:25:21.240]  testing on people to show tips at info wars.com
[02:25:21.240 --> 02:25:24.520]  i know there's thousands of them and we'll just add a few dozen at the bottom
[02:25:24.520 --> 02:25:27.240]  of the article as this story is getting a lot of attention
[02:25:27.240 --> 02:25:30.680]  going back to ted anerson then i'll get into conspiracy theory being censored
[02:25:30.680 --> 02:25:35.880]  and a lot of other news uh ted talking to you here in the new year
[02:25:35.880 --> 02:25:41.880]  uh i mean look i had rolling stone magazine here and since they talked to
[02:25:41.880 --> 02:25:44.120]  george norry about me and he talked about it i'll go ahead and talk about it
[02:25:44.120 --> 02:25:47.560]  now uh but i wasn't going to talk about till it actually
[02:25:47.560 --> 02:25:51.000]  got published but whatever uh they were here and and
[02:25:51.000 --> 02:25:54.280]  they were asking me you know why do you promote gold and i said well look i've
[02:25:54.280 --> 02:25:58.520]  been promoting gold since it was three hundred dollars an ounce or less i've
[02:25:58.520 --> 02:26:01.480]  been promoting silvers since it was five dollars an ounce and look it's gone
[02:26:01.480 --> 02:26:05.080]  up i believe in it i know it's a real commodity
[02:26:05.080 --> 02:26:09.000]  i know that they're devaluing the currency so it's only a matter of time
[02:26:09.000 --> 02:26:13.960]  till these current until these commodities go up
[02:26:13.960 --> 02:26:18.520]  and so i still believe thirty one dollars an ounce for silvers low
[02:26:18.520 --> 02:26:22.200]  fourteen hundred dollars an ounce for gold is low now we'll see who's right
[02:26:22.200 --> 02:26:25.960]  but for ten years in fact let's put on screen for folks
[02:26:25.960 --> 02:26:31.080]  uh mat found a really good one last week ten year gold chart
[02:26:31.080 --> 02:26:35.160]  it's parabolic and it's reaching that point where it goes straight up now
[02:26:35.160 --> 02:26:40.280]  i mean again this is not brain surgery this is not rocket science
[02:26:40.280 --> 02:26:45.320]  this is not this is common sense and so that's why i feel really good promoting
[02:26:45.320 --> 02:26:49.320]  gold and silver not just because it's a great store of wealth and a way to
[02:26:49.320 --> 02:26:52.360]  protect yourself from inflation but also because ted has the best
[02:26:52.360 --> 02:26:55.400]  prices out there ted tell folks about your silver offers and
[02:26:55.400 --> 02:26:58.920]  gold offers today yeah well i mean obviously the best
[02:26:58.920 --> 02:27:02.280]  silver offer that we have alex is ninety seven dollars three of your
[02:27:02.280 --> 02:27:07.560]  videos three silver dollars shipped um at ninety seven dollars total i mean
[02:27:07.560 --> 02:27:11.080]  that you just can't beat that would take credit cards for it
[02:27:11.080 --> 02:27:14.520]  there's a whole long list of things i mean the walking liberty halves are a
[02:27:14.520 --> 02:27:18.040]  fourteen eighty two lakota nations are thirty nine
[02:27:18.040 --> 02:27:21.320]  there there's a you know the bags of silver that that
[02:27:21.320 --> 02:27:24.920]  survival bag of dimes twenty four hundred and fifteen eighty four
[02:27:24.920 --> 02:27:28.440]  of course we carry engelhard bars johnson and matthew i mean there's
[02:27:28.440 --> 02:27:31.480]  you know if you want silver eagles i mean there's just a whole long list of
[02:27:31.480 --> 02:27:35.080]  and you've always got the regular price set to the market that's great
[02:27:35.080 --> 02:27:38.760]  and very competitive but the time machine is available in these radio
[02:27:38.760 --> 02:27:42.840]  specials on whatever you got at the lower price instead of going up
[02:27:42.840 --> 02:27:46.520]  you hold that price they get the time machine their silver and gold
[02:27:46.520 --> 02:27:50.520]  purchase that's what makes mitis resources so special that nobody can
[02:27:50.520 --> 02:27:53.960]  top tell them you want to hear the radio specials
[02:27:53.960 --> 02:27:57.800]  to take advantage of that eight hundred six eight six
[02:27:57.800 --> 02:28:01.720]  two two three seven eight hundred six eight six two two three seven and you
[02:28:01.720 --> 02:28:06.200]  do have the deal where they can get in game uh on dvd with all the extras
[02:28:06.200 --> 02:28:09.640]  follow the republican obama deception with free shipping
[02:28:09.640 --> 02:28:13.720]  so that's over a sixty dollar uh a discount right there
[02:28:13.720 --> 02:28:17.720]  when they buy the three silver dollars for seventy i mean for ninety seven
[02:28:17.720 --> 02:28:20.520]  dollars correct ed yeah that is right and i you just
[02:28:20.520 --> 02:28:23.240]  can't beat that i mean it's like you get the information that
[02:28:23.240 --> 02:28:27.240]  is going to help bring down this this horrific system that seems to be
[02:28:27.240 --> 02:28:31.800]  eating us alive and you get silver at the same time i i don't know how you can
[02:28:31.800 --> 02:28:35.320]  beat that mix alex you can't beat it here's the number eight hundred six
[02:28:35.320 --> 02:28:39.640]  eight six two three seven and i would say buy gold and silver from ted it makes
[02:28:39.640 --> 02:28:42.200]  the network possible but quite frankly these deals
[02:28:42.200 --> 02:28:46.360]  there's not really any profit to speak of i guess on a few of the deals a tiny
[02:28:46.360 --> 02:28:49.880]  one or two or three percent markup but since the market's already gone up
[02:28:49.880 --> 02:28:53.000]  that's not really the case these are ted's lost leaders we do here
[02:28:53.000 --> 02:28:55.960]  and they're great deals it's now time to start moving
[02:28:55.960 --> 02:28:59.560]  at least putting your toe in the water for gold and silver if you're purely in
[02:28:59.560 --> 02:29:03.960]  the stock market or purely in bonds you you're crazy in my opinion
[02:29:03.960 --> 02:29:07.400]  i am completely not in the stock market
[02:29:07.400 --> 02:29:10.920]  and not in bonds and i'm completely in gold and silver
[02:29:10.920 --> 02:29:15.000]  and let me tell you thank god we've done that because it's allowed us to expand

[02:34:29.480 --> 02:34:32.920]  was he just robbed by somebody or did something else happen
[02:34:32.920 --> 02:34:37.560]  or did somebody want to bury some facts
[02:34:37.560 --> 02:34:41.080]  with charities wheeler's body was found in wilmington on friday

[02:35:15.800 --> 02:35:19.320]  douglas i did see this up on the drudge report
[02:35:19.320 --> 02:35:23.800]  today for mainstream news but he's broke it down the fact that it's
[02:35:23.800 --> 02:35:26.680]  connected to global warming umbrella that's their cover
[02:35:26.680 --> 02:35:30.520]  germany hides spy satellite under global warming umbrella
[02:35:30.520 --> 02:35:34.280]  undertaking a costly project with an immense scope
[02:35:34.280 --> 02:35:37.640]  like next-generation spy satellites cannot be done in private the vast
[02:35:37.640 --> 02:35:41.000]  amounts of money involved in these state-of-the-art endeavors
[02:35:41.000 --> 02:35:44.760]  make secrecy next to impossible this is why the current modus operandi is to
[02:35:44.760 --> 02:35:48.040]  cloak large-scale conventional controversial projects
[02:35:48.040 --> 02:35:52.120]  is private commercial ventures with a specific scientific focus like media
[02:35:52.120 --> 02:35:55.560]  buzz term global warming wiki leaks is exposed at
[02:35:55.560 --> 02:35:59.960]  another of these clandestine projects by releasing diplomatic cables showing the
[02:35:59.960 --> 02:36:03.960]  involvement of at least one german agency the bnd
[02:36:03.960 --> 02:36:08.840]  an intelligence service launching spy satellites in the name of global warming
[02:36:08.840 --> 02:36:12.520]  satellites well yeah that's how they introduced in australia and the u.s
[02:36:12.520 --> 02:36:16.040]  that local police would be using spy satellites now that we paid for
[02:36:16.040 --> 02:36:20.280]  to fight the ruskies they go oh it's for the earth it's to stop fires
[02:36:20.280 --> 02:36:23.880]  wall fires the next we learn they're watching your wife sun tan in the
[02:36:23.880 --> 02:36:27.320]  backyard uh so uh interesting article by jason
[02:36:27.320 --> 02:36:30.440]  douglas uh get that out to folks from info wars.com
[02:36:30.440 --> 02:36:33.640]  germany hide spy satellite under global warming umbrella
[02:36:33.640 --> 02:36:37.800]  okay i said i would get to this
[02:36:37.800 --> 02:36:43.000]  and you know when you actually get censored yourself
[02:36:43.080 --> 02:36:49.080]  it's hard to believe i'll never forget in 1999
[02:36:49.080 --> 02:36:53.560]  shamrock communications they own like 50-something radio stations
[02:36:53.560 --> 02:36:58.040]  30-something newspapers medium-sized company
[02:36:58.040 --> 02:37:02.520]  i was getting top ratings top ratings for 989 fm
[02:37:02.520 --> 02:37:07.320]  here in austin and uh making them a lot of money and i was getting paid almost
[02:37:07.320 --> 02:37:10.120]  nothing because i didn't have an agent didn't know radio
[02:37:10.120 --> 02:37:15.960]  i just wanted to reach people and jay leno talked about me
[02:37:15.960 --> 02:37:23.000]  for some reason made a joke and uh a bunch of bbc came in interview me we
[02:37:23.000 --> 02:37:28.600]  were getting a lot of attention and so the the general manager of all the
[02:37:28.600 --> 02:37:33.400]  outfit flew down and he came into the office and
[02:37:33.400 --> 02:37:35.800]  they had a consultant there and they said you're going to cover sex and
[02:37:35.800 --> 02:37:40.680]  relationships now and i said but it's 98 9 fm first
[02:37:40.680 --> 02:37:44.280]  of them it's best and they go not anymore next week
[02:37:44.280 --> 02:37:47.640]  it's just going to be called talk radio
[02:37:47.720 --> 02:37:52.200]  because they had new management then at the local station and i said uh well
[02:37:52.200 --> 02:37:55.560]  what am i not allowed to talk about they had no more bill clinton
[02:37:55.560 --> 02:37:59.160]  no more waco no more delta force no more new world order
[02:37:59.160 --> 02:38:03.160]  and by the way don't talk about governor george w bush
[02:38:03.160 --> 02:38:10.120]  and i went wow and i found out right before mark keester left
[02:38:10.120 --> 02:38:13.240]  to go run the ymca he was the good guy that hired me along with a
[02:38:13.240 --> 02:38:16.760]  former radio guy by the name of shark man was his radio handle who'd actually
[02:38:16.760 --> 02:38:19.800]  been syndicated all over the country and was actually a radio person and called
[02:38:19.800 --> 02:38:23.640]  me they saw me on access said you got talent you want to show boom of course
[02:38:23.640 --> 02:38:29.400]  it was successful uh but
[02:38:29.400 --> 02:38:32.200]  they told me no more of this stuff and about a week later they said you're
[02:38:32.200 --> 02:38:35.800]  still talking about this stuff and i said well i told you in the meeting i
[02:38:35.800 --> 02:38:39.400]  can't shut up about these issues and this is i do this for
[02:38:39.400 --> 02:38:42.920]  passionate reasons and the guy slapped me i mean
[02:38:42.920 --> 02:38:48.040]  pretty hard like oh yeah and it kind of hurt and almost punched him
[02:38:48.040 --> 02:38:53.240]  big fat guy looked like ron jeremy i almost punched him right there i mean
[02:38:53.240 --> 02:38:55.400]  i but i controlled myself because i wanted to reach
[02:38:55.400 --> 02:38:59.560]  the people and defeat the new world order i mean i'll go through a mile you
[02:38:59.560 --> 02:39:01.720]  know what to fight the globalist i'll put up with any amount of
[02:39:01.720 --> 02:39:04.440]  humiliation he slapped me mind he's like hey
[02:39:04.440 --> 02:39:08.040]  you're not gonna be talking like that no more i mean almost like that i was
[02:39:08.040 --> 02:39:11.480]  like he was east coast guy and i said okay
[02:39:11.480 --> 02:39:15.880]  because i knew to at least be passive aggressive enough to just go okay and
[02:39:15.880 --> 02:39:18.920]  then keep doing what i was going to do you know kind of like the japanese
[02:39:18.920 --> 02:39:22.120]  dude just you know they'll let your produce come in from a foreign
[02:39:22.120 --> 02:39:25.320]  country they just let it rot on the dock
[02:39:25.320 --> 02:39:28.680]  so i let it rot on the dock and like 10 weeks later they fired me and
[02:39:28.680 --> 02:39:33.160]  got off on it and tried to get me to blow up and of course here i am today what
[02:39:33.160 --> 02:39:36.360]  you know what failures uh that ron jeremy looked like is
[02:39:36.360 --> 02:39:40.600]  show all of that happened and i still couldn't believe it by the way the day
[02:39:40.600 --> 02:39:43.480]  they fired me the bbc was there again to interview me
[02:39:43.480 --> 02:39:46.760]  and they yelled at me and laughed at me and said get your stuff and get out of
[02:39:46.760 --> 02:39:49.480]  here and did it all in front of the media and
[02:39:49.480 --> 02:39:52.120]  i knew i was telling the truth and fighting the globalist and i wasn't
[02:39:52.120 --> 02:39:54.280]  worried about it i'd already started doing a
[02:39:54.280 --> 02:39:57.400]  show over satellite that was being picked up by stations so i'd already you
[02:39:57.400 --> 02:40:01.000]  know started a new operation it's the information that can't be stopped it's
[02:40:01.000 --> 02:40:05.800]  the signal and then ventura show was gonna air
[02:40:05.800 --> 02:40:09.000]  last year and ventura and i privately did not believe it was gonna air the
[02:40:09.000 --> 02:40:12.040]  global warming special proving it was a fraud before
[02:40:12.040 --> 02:40:16.280]  climate get it even broken the world population reduction plans of morris
[02:40:16.280 --> 02:40:20.120]  strong but then when it did air ventura and i decided it had to be it got under
[02:40:20.120 --> 02:40:23.880]  the radar and then they started having their stuff
[02:40:23.880 --> 02:40:27.560]  robbed and their stuff broken into and threats and things they don't want me to
[02:40:27.560 --> 02:40:33.240]  talk about because it's private and all of this craziness went on
[02:40:33.240 --> 02:40:36.680]  and then their police state episode aired once normally airs
[02:40:36.680 --> 02:40:39.480]  more than 50 times in the next year should have already aired more than 10
[02:40:39.480 --> 02:40:43.240]  times since november but they banned it disappeared it
[02:40:43.240 --> 02:40:46.680]  then they are not airing the jfk as much they're not airing
[02:40:46.680 --> 02:40:51.880]  the wall street very much and people who believe in dvr's people who think
[02:40:51.880 --> 02:40:55.480]  they're great i told you many years ago they watch what you watch
[02:40:55.480 --> 02:40:59.560]  they track what you watch many of them have microphones and cameras built in
[02:40:59.560 --> 02:41:03.160]  all the new video games coming out have it and they track everything you're
[02:41:03.160 --> 02:41:06.440]  doing now that's admitted first got admitted four
[02:41:06.440 --> 02:41:09.720]  years ago janet jackson malfunctioned and they reported oh
[02:41:09.720 --> 02:41:14.280]  you know tivo 2.2 million rewinds replays within one minute of it happening
[02:41:14.280 --> 02:41:18.600]  and the chicago tribune asked how do you know that
[02:41:19.960 --> 02:41:23.160]  so that's what's going on here that's what's happening
[02:41:23.160 --> 02:41:26.840]  and i gotta get to this next video but we come back in the final segment i'll
[02:41:26.840 --> 02:41:31.480]  tell you the latest censorship uh dealing with this
[02:41:31.480 --> 02:41:35.560]  but i barely got time to get to this now this is from the 1970s
[02:41:35.560 --> 02:41:40.920]  it's a orson wells piece from playdoh's the cave
[02:41:40.920 --> 02:41:44.680]  and if you go to info wars dot com you can see it it's it's called the cave
[02:41:44.680 --> 02:41:50.280]  how man is controlled and it describes and i've read playdoh back in
[02:41:50.280 --> 02:41:53.960]  college but i'd forgotten about it it describes everything i've gone through
[02:41:53.960 --> 02:41:57.160]  once you've been out of the cave you don't care about laurels
[02:41:57.160 --> 02:42:00.600]  or awards or you just care about the truth and the
[02:42:00.600 --> 02:42:04.600]  wonderment of life and you passionately want to unlock people
[02:42:04.600 --> 02:42:08.920]  who've been in the mind control system and this was written 2,300 plus years
[02:42:08.920 --> 02:42:12.680]  ago by playdoh and imagine how you can take the cave
[02:42:12.680 --> 02:42:16.760]  wall with the puppets for television all these years later how perfectly the
[02:42:16.760 --> 02:42:20.040]  cave describes the mechanism that has captured
[02:42:20.040 --> 02:42:23.320]  deceived and diverted us from what's important and real about humanity real
[02:42:23.320 --> 02:42:27.640]  life has been arrested in our modern day instead television and other forms of
[02:42:27.640 --> 02:42:31.800]  bread and circus present to us imitations of life that we
[02:42:31.800 --> 02:42:35.240]  learned to take on as our role models and heroes
[02:42:35.240 --> 02:42:39.160]  think about sports think about fashion these are all
[02:42:39.160 --> 02:42:43.080]  shadows on the cave wall the world is so much bigger and if i can just get
[02:42:43.080 --> 02:42:48.200]  people to think outside the box i've done my job here it is playdoh's the cave
[02:42:48.200 --> 02:42:54.760]  let me show in a parable to what extent our nature is enlightened
[02:42:54.760 --> 02:43:01.640]  or unenlightened envision human figures living in an underground
[02:43:01.640 --> 02:43:09.320]  cave with a long entrance across the whole width of the cave
[02:43:09.320 --> 02:43:12.760]  here they've been from their childhood and have their legs and necks
[02:43:12.760 --> 02:43:17.080]  chained so that they cannot move and can only see before them
[02:43:17.080 --> 02:43:24.920]  being prevented by the chains from turning their heads around
[02:43:24.920 --> 02:43:32.360]  above and behind them a fire is blazing at a distance
[02:43:32.360 --> 02:43:36.440]  they see only their own shadows which the fire throws on the opposite wall of
[02:43:36.440 --> 02:43:39.800]  the cave for how could they see anything but the
[02:43:39.800 --> 02:43:49.000]  shadows if they were never allowed to move their heads
[02:43:49.000 --> 02:43:53.080]  between the fire and the prisoners there is a raised
[02:43:53.080 --> 02:43:58.200]  way and a low wall built along the way like the screen
[02:43:58.200 --> 02:44:05.400]  which puppet players have in front of them over which they show the puppets
[02:44:05.400 --> 02:44:10.280]  do you see men passing along the wall carrying all sorts of articles which
[02:44:10.280 --> 02:44:15.320]  they hold projected above the wall statues of men and animals made of wood
[02:44:15.320 --> 02:44:21.560]  and stone and various materials
[02:44:21.560 --> 02:44:25.320]  of the objects which are being carried in like manner
[02:44:25.320 --> 02:44:31.400]  they would only see the shadows and if they were able to converse with one
[02:44:31.400 --> 02:44:34.680]  another would they not suppose that they were
[02:44:34.680 --> 02:44:47.080]  naming what was actually before them
[02:44:47.080 --> 02:44:52.120]  and suppose further that there was an echo which came from the wall
[02:44:52.120 --> 02:44:56.120]  would they not be sure to think when one of the passes by spoke
[02:44:56.120 --> 02:45:00.360]  that the voice came from the passing shadows
[02:45:00.360 --> 02:45:05.000]  to them the truth would be literally nothing but the shadows
[02:45:05.000 --> 02:45:08.920]  of the images
[02:45:10.360 --> 02:45:13.960]  and now look again and see what will naturally follow if one of the prisoners
[02:45:13.960 --> 02:45:17.240]  is released
[02:45:17.240 --> 02:45:21.400]  at first when he is liberated and compelled suddenly to stand up and turn
[02:45:21.400 --> 02:45:25.880]  his head around and look towards the light
[02:45:25.880 --> 02:45:30.440]  all this would hurt him and he would be much too dazzled to see distinctly
[02:45:30.440 --> 02:45:34.600]  those things whose shadows he'd seen before
[02:45:34.600 --> 02:45:39.240]  and then conceive someone saying to him that what he saw before
[02:45:39.240 --> 02:45:45.320]  was an illusion but that now when he's approaching nearer to
[02:45:45.320 --> 02:45:49.480]  reality and his eyes turn toward more real existence
[02:45:49.480 --> 02:45:56.760]  he has a clearer vision what will be his reply
[02:45:56.760 --> 02:46:00.440]  and you may further imagine that his instructor is pointing to the objects
[02:46:00.440 --> 02:46:04.040]  as they pass and requiring him to name them
[02:46:04.040 --> 02:46:08.520]  will he not be perplexed will he not think that the shadows
[02:46:08.520 --> 02:46:17.640]  which he formerly saw are truer than the objects which are now shown to him
[02:46:17.640 --> 02:46:21.240]  and suppose once more that he is reluctantly dragged up a steep and
[02:46:21.240 --> 02:46:25.080]  rugged ascent and held fast until he is forced into the
[02:46:25.080 --> 02:46:29.480]  presence of the sun himself
[02:46:32.120 --> 02:46:35.160]  when he approaches the light his eyes will be dazzled
[02:46:35.160 --> 02:46:38.920]  but he will not be able to see anything at all of what are now called
[02:46:38.920 --> 02:46:42.920]  realities he will require to grow accustomed to the
[02:46:42.920 --> 02:46:51.080]  side of the upper world
[02:46:51.240 --> 02:46:56.600]  and first he will see the shadows best next the reflections of objects in the
[02:46:56.600 --> 02:47:01.640]  water and then the objects themselves
[02:47:01.640 --> 02:47:05.960]  then he will gaze upon the stars and the spangled heavens
[02:47:05.960 --> 02:47:13.000]  and the light of the moon he will see the sky and the stars by night
[02:47:13.000 --> 02:47:17.400]  last of all he will be able to see the sun
[02:47:17.400 --> 02:47:21.640]  and not mere reflections of it in the water but he will see the sun
[02:47:21.640 --> 02:47:28.120]  in its own proper place and not in another
[02:47:28.120 --> 02:47:34.600]  and he will contemplate the sun as it is will he not then proceed to argue
[02:47:34.600 --> 02:47:39.560]  that it is the sun who gives the season and the years
[02:47:39.560 --> 02:47:43.400]  and is the guardian of all that is in the visible world
[02:47:43.400 --> 02:47:47.400]  and in a certain way the cause of all things which his fellows
[02:47:47.400 --> 02:47:51.160]  have been accustomed to behold
[02:47:51.160 --> 02:47:59.160]  clearly he would first see the sun and then reason about it
[02:47:59.160 --> 02:48:03.240]  and when he remembered his old habitation and what was the wisdom
[02:48:03.240 --> 02:48:07.320]  of the cave and his fellow prisoners
[02:48:07.320 --> 02:48:12.040]  do you not suppose that he would bless himself for the change
[02:48:12.040 --> 02:48:17.720]  pity them
[02:48:17.720 --> 02:48:21.880]  and if they were in the habit of conferring honors among themselves on
[02:48:21.880 --> 02:48:26.200]  those who were the quickest to observe the passing shadows
[02:48:26.200 --> 02:48:29.720]  and to remark which of them went before and which followed after
[02:48:29.720 --> 02:48:33.160]  and which were together and who were therefore best able to draw conclusions
[02:48:33.160 --> 02:48:35.960]  as to the future
[02:48:36.520 --> 02:48:40.680]  do you think that he would care for such honors and glories
[02:48:40.680 --> 02:48:44.760]  or envy the possesses of them would he not say
[02:48:44.760 --> 02:48:53.080]  with Homer better to be the poor servant of a poor master
[02:48:53.080 --> 02:48:57.560]  and to endure anything rather than think as they do
[02:48:57.560 --> 02:49:01.160]  and live after their manner
[02:49:01.880 --> 02:49:06.680]  imagine once more such a one coming suddenly out of the sun
[02:49:06.680 --> 02:49:12.440]  to be replaced in his old situation would he not be certain to have his eyes
[02:49:12.440 --> 02:49:15.560]  full of darkness
[02:49:16.920 --> 02:49:19.960]  and if there were a contest of measuring the shadows
[02:49:19.960 --> 02:49:23.960]  and he had to compete with the prisoners who had never moved out of the den
[02:49:23.960 --> 02:49:29.000]  while his sight was still weak and before his eyes had become steady
[02:49:29.000 --> 02:49:33.480]  wouldn't they all laugh at him and say he had spoiled his eyesight by going up
[02:49:33.480 --> 02:49:37.320]  there but it was better not to even think of
[02:49:37.320 --> 02:49:43.400]  ascending
[02:49:43.400 --> 02:49:46.600]  and if anyone tried to release another
[02:49:46.600 --> 02:49:53.960]  and lead him up to the light let them only catch the offender
[02:49:53.960 --> 02:49:57.560]  and they would put him to death
[02:49:57.560 --> 02:50:05.640]  it is the task of the enlightened
[02:50:05.640 --> 02:50:09.560]  not only to ascend to learning and to see the good
[02:50:09.560 --> 02:50:13.560]  but to be willing to descend again to those prisoners and to share their
[02:50:13.560 --> 02:50:19.320]  troubles and their honors whether they are worth having or not
[02:50:19.320 --> 02:50:24.840]  and this thing must do even with the prospect of death
[02:50:24.840 --> 02:50:31.080]  they shall give of their help to one another
[02:50:31.080 --> 02:50:40.760]  wherever each class is able to help the community

[02:55:14.120 --> 02:55:18.200]  thought was an attempt to make it fail it still got top ratings on a friday
[02:55:18.200 --> 02:55:21.720]  night then we noticed that they didn't rear the police
[02:55:21.720 --> 02:55:25.560]  state episode sure enough entourage called
[02:55:25.560 --> 02:55:31.160]  you heard him here a few weeks ago confirmed deep six at the top
[02:55:31.160 --> 02:55:35.080]  now we've noticed that they have not been airing or barely re-airing like
[02:55:35.080 --> 02:55:38.040]  they'll air one of the other not as hard hitting ones two or three times
[02:55:38.040 --> 02:55:44.600]  compared to airing the jfk once jfk is getting deep six
[02:55:44.600 --> 02:55:49.800]  others are getting deep six and tvo and and other dvrs in their manuals the
[02:55:49.800 --> 02:55:53.640]  two-way tvos you know that it's coming in off cable
[02:55:53.640 --> 02:55:58.120]  they admittedly sell on the side what you watch and what you do your
[02:55:58.120 --> 02:56:03.400]  psychological profile for advertising uh that you know target you through
[02:56:03.400 --> 02:56:08.120]  direct mail internet and other ways just like google does and they track what
[02:56:08.120 --> 02:56:14.120]  you're watching what you're recording and they never i've looked this up
[02:56:14.120 --> 02:56:20.600]  never go in and erase things off dvrs remotely
[02:56:20.600 --> 02:56:23.800]  though they have that power we have had emails the last month
[02:56:23.800 --> 02:56:27.160]  pouring in so we've done test here at the office
