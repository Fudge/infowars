[00:00.000 --> 00:26.400]  If you are receiving this transmission you are the resistance live from the info wars.com studios it's Alex Jones
[00:30.000 --> 00:40.000]  They've admitted we don't have the adults Al Gore says this we're going right for your children
[00:40.000 --> 01:09.000]  Our earth healthy strong and full of life but wait what's that you've got there it looks like you've got a case of the humans to be a healthy earth all of your elements must be in equilibrium however these parasites slaughter all other forms of life guzzle your natural resources
[01:09.000 --> 01:35.000]  and poison your atmosphere once contracted humans act quickly they multiply over 300,000 a day earth is just the start who knows what's next
[01:39.000 --> 02:06.000]  I just played for you the 2007 Berlin film festival winner of short films it's called humans by three legs and it shows humans not just a scourge on the planet earth the people that brought you Beethoven the folks that brought you mathematics the mind of Max Planck envisioning atomic theory and I mean that's humans
[02:06.000 --> 02:25.000]  we are a scourge and it shows us unfortunately spreading the space and destroying the universe at the end I mean this is incredible and I was just thinking this morning about how many video clips I mean I have ABC news Australia the headline teaching kids when to die
[02:25.000 --> 02:42.000]  and it says if you don't kill yourself by 11 or 14 in the calculations even if you try to have a good carbon footprint you must die at 14 little animals died it shows little puppies having their heads chopped up in fact guys pull up the ABC story ABC tells kids when to die
[02:42.000 --> 02:57.000]  and then we have the prison planet article that actually has screenshots because they pulled it of the the heads of being cut off of small animals so the message is small animals are dying and I talked to parents who still have their children in private school and government brainwashing camps
[02:57.000 --> 03:16.000]  that's why I homeschool my children and their young daughters and sons will start crying when they see a construction site or bulldozers and they say I need to die I mean I've had people at pool parties you know tell me this their children cry it's seven year olds it's time for me to die I'm evil
[03:16.000 --> 03:33.000]  and then we have of course this 1010 project funded the climate exchange in Al Gore the guardian local governments in England funding it saying it's your choice and the kids say I don't want to make carbon cuts and so they murder them they blow them up with guts and blood and those that submit to the
[03:33.000 --> 03:48.000]  tyranny they have blood all over them and are horrified and they kill footballers and blow up coaches and blow up talk show host and they have a corporate scene with a corporate boss standing above all his employees with an arrogant effeminate you know behavior these people always have for some reason
[03:48.000 --> 04:08.000]  and and says oh lovely you're not going to do it good I get to kill you and kills them so then I have this article on alternative to the new wave of eco fascism the guardian says why these calls for total tyranny and Nazism are are are bad we just need a soft loving tyranny
[04:08.000 --> 04:23.000]  so there's a total shift to the to them saying look you won't go along with this we're going to kill you Dillingpole an expert on this joins us and we're going to later play a short clip of Pichari saying hey we're going to scare the kids and they've admitted we don't have the adults Al Gore says this we're going
[04:23.000 --> 04:41.000]  right for your children so are you going to let them indoctrinate your children with an anti human hate of themselves and how to commit suicide these people are totally criminal I mean they're trying to arrest members of your parliament in Europe who criticize Muslims mildly for hate crime is this
[04:41.000 --> 04:58.000]  not a hate crime teaching kids to commit suicide and that was 11 years ago 2007 anti human agenda exposed now at band on video share it while you still can stay with us we'll be right back Stephen Crowder coming up
[04:58.000 --> 05:21.000]  the technocrats the social engineers the behavioral psychologist they're all part of the same satanic globalist control freak system that seeks to play God that seeks to turn the general population of this earth into their slaves into putting into play in their hands that they control
[05:21.000 --> 05:39.000]  and chief amongst their physical attacks is keeping us from high quality vitamins and minerals that are essential for life on this planet and so the information we cover exposes their evil works and sabotages their globalist takeover and we're having an incredible effect thanks to your support and your word about
[05:39.000 --> 05:58.000]  but it's also important to take care of our bodies themselves with high quality water filtration info or store.com with amazing supplements many of which that just came back in stock like bodies ultimate turmeric formula now 40% off for a limited time at info or store.com so let's fight the info war but also take care of our bodies
[06:09.000 --> 06:21.000]  info wars tomorrow's news today.
[06:21.000 --> 06:39.000]  Two years ago was revealed communist Chinese agents stole super deadly viruses out of a Canadian lab and transferred them to Bill Gates's operative Fauci and does it that's now all confirmed.
[06:39.000 --> 07:00.000]  Hitting mainstream news around the world they transferred the virus that a 40% kill rate in humans that were infected now they've souped it up the airborne and kill 80% Bill Gates is telling you running drills right now the more deadly virus is coming and now we learn the virus.
[07:00.000 --> 07:15.000]  The first time has appeared in the wild in India. Can you put two and two together. Ladies and gentlemen this isn't the 1990s film 12 monkeys this isn't fiction this is happening right now.
[07:15.000 --> 07:40.000]  But as the plot of the film showed it's about a global elite wanting depopulation and pulling the trigger.
[07:40.000 --> 07:54.000]  Excuse me sir remind me have a look at the contents of your bag please.
[07:54.000 --> 07:57.000]  Biological samples.
[07:57.000 --> 08:00.000]  I have the papers right here.
[08:00.000 --> 08:03.000]  What I have to ask you to open this up sir.
[08:03.000 --> 08:06.000]  Open it.
[08:06.000 --> 08:11.000]  Yes of course.
[08:11.000 --> 08:15.000]  See biological check the papers.
[08:15.000 --> 08:24.000]  It's all proper permit.
[08:24.000 --> 08:39.000]  It's empty. Well yes to be sure it looks empty.
[08:39.000 --> 08:46.000]  There you see also invisible to the naked eye.
[08:46.000 --> 08:51.000]  It doesn't even have an odor.
[08:51.000 --> 08:54.000]  It's not necessary sir.
[08:54.000 --> 08:56.000]  There you go. Thank you for your cooperation.
[08:56.000 --> 09:12.000]  Have a good flight.
[09:12.000 --> 09:27.000]  There's supposed to use the bears to look for unusual things and we're seeing unusual deaths. We're seeing secondary deaths from people just giving off something whether it's the vaccine or some component of it that's killing other people around them.
[09:27.000 --> 09:30.000]  So who weren't there who didn't receive the injection.
[09:30.000 --> 09:45.000]  The most compelling one is a one month old baby that was breastfeeding mother gets a second Pfizer shot baby dies of rare thrombocytopenia which is one of the things I've written a paper about this going to be published on the event the thrombocytopenia following this drug.
[09:45.000 --> 09:54.000]  Thrombocytopenia folks is when you don't make any platelet cells and platelet cells and when you've got to have you don't make any platelet cells your blood down and you can bleed to death.
[09:54.000 --> 10:04.000]  Right so it's it's an unusual this is not anything we've seen before it's not the thrombocytopenia that you and I have seen as physicians in the past totally different animal and this is happening.
[10:04.000 --> 10:08.000]  That's the kind of thing that should stop any other vaccine program but this is not a vaccine program.
[10:08.000 --> 10:23.000]  This is something else and it's interesting that they're now telling pregnant women they can get it children they can get it but I'm going to read from one of the studies it says reproductive toxicity animal studies of potential toxicity to reproduction and development have not yet been completed.
[10:23.000 --> 10:31.000]  Neither genotoxicity meaning how it damages your genome your DNA or RNA or carcinogenic studies were performed.
[10:31.000 --> 10:40.000]  However the components of the vaccine are not expected to have genotoxic potential I'm comforted by that.
[10:40.000 --> 10:57.000]  That's Dr. Lee Merritt I have some family pretty close family doesn't listen to me the took the Pfizer shot and now has the platelet disease out of nowhere three months after the shots and it's now being put on hospitals preparing to die.
[10:57.000 --> 11:00.000]  They have no platelets.
[11:00.000 --> 11:05.000]  I just learned that in the last few days.
[11:05.000 --> 11:13.000]  It is the soft kill weapon being unrolled against us now but it's not just scientists and doctors like Merritt that are out telling the truth.
[11:13.000 --> 11:23.000]  I saw this clip this morning of this amazing lady everything she says is true on Instagram simply stating the facts of this criminal gaslighting.
[11:23.000 --> 11:35.000]  I had a gentleman argue with me today saying that the unvaxxed are dying at a rapid rate compared to the accident.
[11:35.000 --> 11:40.000]  He wanted me to show him proof and not to tell him to look up some research.
[11:40.000 --> 11:53.000]  He provided him with CDC stats and the FDA where they recall the PCR test because they were 200% wrong on their positive cases.
[11:53.000 --> 11:56.000]  That was over completely ignored.
[11:56.000 --> 12:04.000]  I sent him article after article about how West Virginia governor said that 97% of people in the hospitals are double vaxxed.
[12:04.000 --> 12:13.000]  It doesn't count so imagine still two years later thinking that this is about a virus.
[12:13.000 --> 12:19.000]  Imagine still thinking that this is not a power grab by the government.
[12:19.000 --> 12:25.000]  Imagine still thinking that masks save lives.
[12:25.000 --> 12:33.000]  Imagine still thinking that if you're unvaccinated you're gonna die even though there's a 99.
[12:33.000 --> 12:35.000]  I have had COVID.
[12:35.000 --> 12:36.000]  Do you know what I did?
[12:36.000 --> 12:41.000]  I took Advil and that was fine.
[12:41.000 --> 12:42.000]  I've had worse quotes.
[12:42.000 --> 12:47.000]  Why do these people think that getting COVID is an automatic death sentence?
[12:47.000 --> 12:49.000]  Also why are people only dying in the hospitals?
[12:49.000 --> 12:50.000]  Why?
[12:50.000 --> 12:51.000]  Why?
[12:51.000 --> 12:52.000]  Why?
[12:52.000 --> 12:53.000]  Why aren't more people asking?
[12:53.000 --> 12:55.000]  Why?
[12:55.000 --> 12:57.000]  Is discernment dead?
[12:57.000 --> 13:00.000]  Is common sense dead?
[13:00.000 --> 13:10.000]  Do these people literally just watch their TV screens and go, okay, yeah, that doesn't make sense but I'm gonna live it.
[13:10.000 --> 13:12.000]  I want off.
[13:12.000 --> 13:22.000]  I want off this fucking ride and I want this movie to end because I have lost respect for half of society.
[13:22.000 --> 13:31.000]  Well, I'm ready to vote for her for president right now.
[13:31.000 --> 13:33.000]  I don't even know her name.
[13:33.000 --> 13:35.000]  She wants off this effing ride.
[13:35.000 --> 13:41.000]  If you want to know what living inside the New World Order is gonna be like, well, look in the mirror because you're inside just the beginning of it.
[13:41.000 --> 13:44.000]  And as you notice, it gets worse by the minute.
[13:44.000 --> 13:50.000]  Thanks for joining us on this live original October 19th transmission.
[13:50.000 --> 13:55.000]  And I see a lot of listeners email us and they call us and they say, man, all you talk about is the vaccine.
[13:55.000 --> 13:57.000]  All you talk about is the Great Reshed.
[13:57.000 --> 14:00.000]  All you talk about is the New World Order because it's everything.
[14:00.000 --> 14:04.000]  It's going to destroy our way of life and finally kill us.
[14:04.000 --> 14:06.000]  This is modern war.
[14:06.000 --> 14:09.000]  I know they're teaching five-year-olds how to give blowjobs.
[14:09.000 --> 14:10.000]  We already know that.
[14:10.000 --> 14:12.000]  I know there's Satan worshipers everywhere.
[14:12.000 --> 14:14.000]  Hell, I got Reuters right here.
[14:14.000 --> 14:18.000]  200,000 children raped in France by clergy alone government admits.
[14:18.000 --> 14:20.000]  Total peddlethal rings run the government.
[14:20.000 --> 14:22.000]  You can take one look at Macron.
[14:22.000 --> 14:25.000]  He was one they used at age 12 as a sex operative.
[14:25.000 --> 14:27.000]  I know all that.
[14:27.000 --> 14:29.000]  I know the federal deserves private.
[14:29.000 --> 14:31.000]  I've been on there 28 years saying it.
[14:31.000 --> 14:34.000]  The New World Order is now attacking us.
[14:34.000 --> 14:38.000]  It's the Tyrannosaurus Rex eating us.
[14:38.000 --> 14:42.000]  I can talk about the pack of gremlins that run around behind it all day long,
[14:42.000 --> 14:49.000]  but this is the big world government, world ID, carbon tax controlling everything you do.
[14:49.000 --> 14:51.000]  And it's just Reuters, just a minor headline.
[14:51.000 --> 14:54.000]  Yeah, 200,000 kids raped, told us sex slavery, some killed.
[14:54.000 --> 14:55.000]  No big deal.
[14:55.000 --> 14:56.000]  But none of it exists.
[14:56.000 --> 14:59.000]  CNN says and Twitter, you know, Alex Jones is crazy.
[14:59.000 --> 15:00.000]  There's no peddlethal rings.
[15:00.000 --> 15:02.000]  Oh, no, no, no, no.
[15:02.000 --> 15:05.000]  And the UN and NATO just run giant operations.
[15:05.000 --> 15:07.000]  Yes, pure evil got control.
[15:07.000 --> 15:08.000]  It multiplied.
[15:08.000 --> 15:09.000]  It took over.
[15:09.000 --> 15:11.000]  And now we're being attacked.
[15:11.000 --> 15:17.000]  So, same thing in Germany, all run by the CIA,
[15:17.000 --> 15:20.000]  all run by the globalists to bring down the society.
[15:20.000 --> 15:22.000]  Because if they can't kill babies where they're born,
[15:22.000 --> 15:24.000]  they're sure as hell going to rape them.
[15:24.000 --> 15:26.000]  So here's the deal.
[15:26.000 --> 15:28.000]  This is what happens every day.
[15:28.000 --> 15:29.000]  I study at night.
[15:29.000 --> 15:30.000]  I get up at five in the morning.
[15:30.000 --> 15:31.000]  So I don't have 4.30 in the morning.
[15:31.000 --> 15:33.000]  I'm super well researched.
[15:33.000 --> 15:35.000]  I get in here and have like hundreds of articles, hundreds of clips.
[15:35.000 --> 15:36.000]  They're all totally insane.
[15:36.000 --> 15:37.000]  You just saw a bunch of them.
[15:37.000 --> 15:39.000]  That's not 1% of what I got today.
[15:39.000 --> 15:41.000]  And I got Stephen Crowder coming up in 15 minutes.
[15:41.000 --> 15:43.000]  And I got something.
[15:43.000 --> 15:44.000]  You want to hear about the virus?
[15:44.000 --> 15:45.000]  Well, most of you do.
[15:45.000 --> 15:46.000]  I know.
[15:46.000 --> 15:47.000]  You understand it's a takeover.
[15:47.000 --> 15:48.000]  You get what this is about.
[15:48.000 --> 15:50.000]  This is the fight now for the whole world government.
[15:50.000 --> 15:53.000]  But there's bigger news that just broke on the virus front.
[15:53.000 --> 15:56.000]  Fauci cooked up something that kills 80% of people.
[15:56.000 --> 15:58.000]  And evidence shows they may have already released.
[15:58.000 --> 15:59.000]  If you're concerned about the power grid
[15:59.000 --> 16:02.000]  and want to generate your own supply of off-grid electricity,
[16:02.000 --> 16:06.000]  this will be the most important message you'll hear this year.
[16:06.000 --> 16:07.000]  Here's why.
[16:07.000 --> 16:11.000]  We now have a small number of solar generators back in stock.
[16:11.000 --> 16:13.000]  These emergency backup systems provide
[16:13.000 --> 16:16.000]  life-saving backup power when you need it most.
[16:16.000 --> 16:19.000]  And unlike gas generators, solar generators run quietly,
[16:19.000 --> 16:21.000]  emit no dangerous fumes,
[16:21.000 --> 16:25.000]  and produce an endless supply of free electricity from the sun.
[16:25.000 --> 16:28.000]  Whether it's wildfires, dangerous weather, power grid issues,
[16:28.000 --> 16:30.000]  or just getting off the grid,
[16:30.000 --> 16:33.000]  you'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again.
[16:33.000 --> 16:37.000]  Even better, all this week, radio listeners get over $700
[16:37.000 --> 16:39.000]  in free off-the-grid bonuses, too.
[16:39.000 --> 16:43.000]  Go to mysolarbackup.com to learn more and check availability.
[16:43.000 --> 16:45.000]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[16:45.000 --> 16:47.000]  Look for the free report, crisis cooling,
[16:47.000 --> 16:51.000]  how to make absolutely sure your meat, milk, and medicines
[16:51.000 --> 16:54.000]  stay safe and cool in any power outage.
[16:54.000 --> 16:57.000]  Yours free at mysolarbackup.com.
[16:57.000 --> 16:58.000]  Hey, everybody.
[16:58.000 --> 17:00.000]  If you've ever thought about heirloom beans
[17:00.000 --> 17:02.000]  as a storable survival food,
[17:02.000 --> 17:03.000]  I've got great news.
[17:03.000 --> 17:06.000]  In fact, I'll bet it's the best news you've heard in a while.
[17:06.000 --> 17:07.000]  Here's the thing.
[17:07.000 --> 17:11.000]  We've just received a fresh batch of gourmet heirloom beans,
[17:11.000 --> 17:12.000]  survival soup beans.
[17:12.000 --> 17:15.000]  These beans are gorgeous, highly nutritious,
[17:15.000 --> 17:17.000]  and above all, with no hesitation whatsoever,
[17:17.000 --> 17:20.000]  the best tasting beans in the entire world.
[17:20.000 --> 17:21.000]  The best part?
[17:21.000 --> 17:24.000]  We've dropped the price by 33% this week
[17:24.000 --> 17:27.000]  for listeners who know higher food prices are coming
[17:27.000 --> 17:31.000]  and want an inflation hedge you can actually eat if you want to.
[17:31.000 --> 17:32.000]  It gets even better.
[17:32.000 --> 17:35.000]  With your permission and with a high regard for your health
[17:35.000 --> 17:38.000]  and well being, I also want to send you two pounds
[17:38.000 --> 17:41.000]  of what we think is the single most underrated
[17:41.000 --> 17:43.000]  superfood in the world, period.
[17:43.000 --> 17:45.000]  Go to soupbeansurvival.com
[17:45.000 --> 17:47.000]  that's soupbeansurvival.com
[17:47.000 --> 17:50.000]  and discover the real reason we're giving this unusual
[17:50.000 --> 17:53.000]  superfood away at soupbeansurvival.com
[17:53.000 --> 18:01.000]  that's soupbeansurvival.com
[18:01.000 --> 18:06.000]  If you only knew the power of the dark side,
[18:06.000 --> 18:08.000]  join Bill Gates,
[18:08.000 --> 18:13.000]  and together we will defeat humanity.
[18:13.000 --> 18:19.000]  Then our gods will reward us with eternal life.
[18:19.000 --> 18:23.000]  That's basically the ethos of the globalists.
[18:23.000 --> 18:25.000]  They must first play God,
[18:25.000 --> 18:29.000]  they must first prove that they are the fittest
[18:29.000 --> 18:31.000]  in their social Darwinistic system.
[18:31.000 --> 18:33.000]  And in a way they're right,
[18:33.000 --> 18:36.000]  if we let them lie to us and dumb us down and poison us
[18:36.000 --> 18:39.000]  and destroy our children's futures
[18:39.000 --> 18:41.000]  and the evidence is overwhelming and out in the open,
[18:41.000 --> 18:44.000]  we really deserve what's happened to us.
[18:44.000 --> 18:46.000]  So I ask you now,
[18:46.000 --> 18:50.000]  are you going to step up and expose the new order even more?
[18:50.000 --> 18:54.000]  I know I'm pledging to step up and redouble my efforts.
[18:54.000 --> 18:58.000]  The front lines of the fight is infowars.com
[18:58.000 --> 19:04.000]  The COVID-19 face diaper is a symbol of subservience,
[19:04.000 --> 19:06.000]  a symbol of slavery,
[19:06.000 --> 19:08.000]  a symbol of the change
[19:08.000 --> 19:10.000]  that the medical tyranny combine
[19:10.000 --> 19:12.000]  controlled by the global private corporations
[19:12.000 --> 19:14.000]  has put in place.
[19:14.000 --> 19:18.000]  It is the symbol of the permanent emergency
[19:18.000 --> 19:20.000]  from which we will never emerge.
[19:20.000 --> 19:23.000]  It is the symbol that we are diseased at evil and bad
[19:23.000 --> 19:26.000]  and must cover our diseased criminal faces
[19:26.000 --> 19:28.000]  from the light of the sun.
[19:28.000 --> 19:35.000]  It is the symbol of our complete and total absolute surrender to evil.
[19:35.000 --> 19:37.000]  Ladies and gentlemen,
[19:37.000 --> 19:40.000]  we are crossing the Rubicon now.
[19:40.000 --> 19:43.000]  The entire future destiny of humanity is upon us.
[19:43.000 --> 19:47.000]  Cloud Schwab and the UN admit they're coming out with implantable microchips
[19:47.000 --> 19:49.000]  as part of the World ID and carbon taxes.
[19:49.000 --> 19:52.000]  Things only get worse from here if we submit.
[19:52.000 --> 19:55.000]  They only get better if we resist and say no.
[19:55.000 --> 20:19.000]  Noncompliance, noncompliance, noncompliance.
[20:25.000 --> 20:47.000]  How about we just play some Romstein today?
[20:47.000 --> 20:51.000]  Very rough song, but very pretty lyrics.
[20:51.000 --> 20:53.000]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[20:53.000 --> 21:01.000]  Thank you so much for joining us on this live October 19, 2021
[21:01.000 --> 21:07.000]  transmission that the power structure is working as hard as it can to shut down.
[21:07.000 --> 21:11.000]  Okay, let me tell you what we got coming up for you today.
[21:11.000 --> 21:14.000]  I was on Stephen Crowder's show a few weeks ago in Dallas.
[21:14.000 --> 21:15.000]  Love the show.
[21:15.000 --> 21:18.000]  Super funny, super talented, super smart crew.
[21:18.000 --> 21:22.000]  And of course, their main star, Stephen Crowder, who is a shining star of Liberty.
[21:22.000 --> 21:29.000]  And they've told him a lot that if he criticizes the anointed protected group,
[21:29.000 --> 21:32.000]  amongst all the protected groups is the trans male,
[21:32.000 --> 21:36.000]  the males that give up their masculinism to become female, they believe.
[21:36.000 --> 21:39.000]  And I don't hate people that want to do that or say that.
[21:39.000 --> 21:42.000]  I do hate them trying to be the center of attention and take over my life
[21:42.000 --> 21:45.000]  and go into women's bathrooms and show their penises to people
[21:45.000 --> 21:48.000]  because there is that group of them doing that, that the media is defending.
[21:48.000 --> 21:52.000]  And also raping women inside, you know, bathroom stalls.
[21:52.000 --> 21:56.000]  And the press even covers for that, as you know.
[21:56.000 --> 22:00.000]  Well, he's been told, don't you dare talk about it anymore.
[22:00.000 --> 22:04.000]  When, you know, men go to prison saying they're a woman, they go, oh, you're a woman.
[22:04.000 --> 22:07.000]  Oh, we'll just put you in a prison so you can rape and impregnate women.
[22:07.000 --> 22:09.000]  He dared criticize that.
[22:09.000 --> 22:12.000]  So they gave him another strike and one more.
[22:12.000 --> 22:17.000]  He's banned off YouTube where he's as big as Joe Rogan ever was
[22:17.000 --> 22:20.000]  on YouTube, everything he does gets millions of views.
[22:20.000 --> 22:23.000]  And that's despite all of them shadow banning him.
[22:23.000 --> 22:28.000]  So a lot of people say, hey, Alex, you know, all you talk about is the great reset
[22:28.000 --> 22:31.000]  and the carbon tax and the forced vaccines and all of that.
[22:31.000 --> 22:34.000]  We really like it when you talk about the culture wars.
[22:34.000 --> 22:36.000]  Well, you know, the COVID thing is the big culture war.
[22:36.000 --> 22:37.000]  It's the big takeover.
[22:37.000 --> 22:39.000]  It's the divide and conquer tactic.
[22:39.000 --> 22:42.000]  It's the blaming people that don't take the shots for all the sicknesses
[22:42.000 --> 22:45.000]  and while the globalists actually depopulate the general public.
[22:45.000 --> 22:50.000]  I mean, this is the big extermination move.
[22:50.000 --> 22:54.000]  But it is important to look at the other aspects they've got to depopulate
[22:54.000 --> 22:56.000]  and deindustrialize the West.
[22:56.000 --> 23:01.000]  And in China, they have a one-shot policy where they kill the little girls mainly.
[23:01.000 --> 23:05.000]  In some towns, they have two to one boys born in the last 30 years in China.
[23:05.000 --> 23:06.000]  They've gotten rid of that.
[23:06.000 --> 23:08.000]  Now they have three children the government wants them to have,
[23:08.000 --> 23:10.000]  because now they've broken with the globalist to a great extent,
[23:10.000 --> 23:11.000]  at least in that policy.
[23:11.000 --> 23:16.000]  They're now going with a more race-based type system
[23:16.000 --> 23:21.000]  that you would call more nationalistic in the vernacular,
[23:21.000 --> 23:24.000]  but a race-based nationalism.
[23:24.000 --> 23:28.000]  But here, you need to understand that at the end of the day
[23:28.000 --> 23:32.000]  from the Tavistock Institute and from the Carnegie Endowment
[23:32.000 --> 23:36.000]  and from the CIA, they developed and deployed this transgenerous
[23:36.000 --> 23:39.000]  in the 50s, began to gestate in the 60s,
[23:39.000 --> 23:42.000]  began deploying in the 70s, 80s, and 90s.
[23:42.000 --> 23:45.000]  As the West one-shot policy,
[23:45.000 --> 23:48.000]  if you can't kill one of the children before they're ever born
[23:48.000 --> 23:53.000]  or keep them from being born, you need to kill their fertility.
[23:53.000 --> 23:58.000]  And if you give girls or boys puberty blockers or physically chop off
[23:58.000 --> 24:02.000]  and mutilate their genitals, their ovaries or their testicles,
[24:02.000 --> 24:07.000]  then they do become a genetic eunuch
[24:07.000 --> 24:10.000]  so that they cannot have any progeny.
[24:10.000 --> 24:13.000]  And so let's just say what it is in their own literature.
[24:13.000 --> 24:16.000]  They can fancy it all up and have Caitlyn Jenner flapping around
[24:16.000 --> 24:21.000]  in an owl outfit on TV, just terrific.
[24:21.000 --> 24:24.000]  It's absolutely disgusting that that wins women of the year.
[24:24.000 --> 24:26.000]  I mean, if you're going to have a man saying it's a woman
[24:26.000 --> 24:28.000]  winning a thing of the year,
[24:28.000 --> 24:30.000]  can they at least look like a good-looking woman or something?
[24:30.000 --> 24:33.000]  I mean, it's just all about an assault on humanity,
[24:33.000 --> 24:36.000]  an assault on our children, our women, our men, our boys,
[24:36.000 --> 24:40.000]  our girls, what we are by this scientific mad scientist takeover
[24:40.000 --> 24:46.000]  that wants us to accept all these horrors of human-animal hybrids.
[24:46.000 --> 24:48.000]  Well, they first got you to get you to accept Caitlyn Jenner,
[24:48.000 --> 24:53.000]  who looks like an old evil snapping turtle with a big wig on,
[24:53.000 --> 24:57.000]  or dragling storytime with convicted pedophiles all over the country.
[24:57.000 --> 25:01.000]  In many cases, dressed up like it the clown, scarier than it the clown,
[25:01.000 --> 25:04.000]  I expected to be hiding in a drainage ditch somewhere,
[25:04.000 --> 25:07.000]  you know, when little kids out there playing with their paper boat,
[25:07.000 --> 25:12.000]  and you go set your kids on the altar of their swollen crotches.
[25:12.000 --> 25:14.000]  We have all the videos of this.
[25:14.000 --> 25:17.000]  That is a ritual, ladies and gentlemen.
[25:17.000 --> 25:19.000]  To make you praise it, to make you be part of the in-group,
[25:19.000 --> 25:22.000]  because you'll praise something you know is a fraud,
[25:22.000 --> 25:25.000]  like, oh, you're twice as likely to get sick or die from the vaccine,
[25:25.000 --> 25:29.000]  that's the federal government's own numbers.
[25:29.000 --> 25:32.000]  But CNN says it's safe and effective. That's gaslighting.
[25:32.000 --> 25:38.000]  So, here is the banned video from YouTube.
[25:38.000 --> 25:40.000]  And I'd love to take the credit and say, oh, the most banned guy on the Internet,
[25:40.000 --> 25:42.000]  Alex Jones, the reason he got the strike.
[25:42.000 --> 25:46.000]  No, it's specifically for the skit they did that I was part of.
[25:46.000 --> 25:49.000]  I'm just not going to take the credit here, because I don't get the credit.
[25:49.000 --> 25:51.000]  Here is a piece of that.
[25:51.000 --> 25:54.000]  We'll come back with the man, Stephen Crowder.
[25:54.000 --> 25:56.000]  Here's another story that's going on.
[25:56.000 --> 25:57.000]  We were ready for the story, right?
[25:57.000 --> 25:58.000]  Yep.
[25:58.000 --> 25:59.000]  Quarter Black, Garrett?
[25:59.000 --> 26:01.000]  Awesome.
[26:01.000 --> 26:02.000]  Okay.
[26:02.000 --> 26:03.000]  Are we ready, though?
[26:03.000 --> 26:05.000]  I don't know that I'm ever ready.
[26:05.000 --> 26:06.000]  I don't know that we want to be ready.
[26:06.000 --> 26:09.000]  But the Women's Liberation Front, I already hate this.
[26:09.000 --> 26:10.000]  The worst.
[26:10.000 --> 26:14.000]  Reported at least one woman at the Central California Women's Facility
[26:14.000 --> 26:20.000]  was pregnant after a male transgender male prisoner was transferred there.
[26:20.000 --> 26:24.000]  Keep in mind, the male prisoner was permitted to transfer under the new California law,
[26:24.000 --> 26:28.000]  SB 132, which allows biological males.
[26:28.000 --> 26:30.000]  We're not supposed to use the term biological males now.
[26:30.000 --> 26:32.000]  We're supposed to use a person with penis or something?
[26:32.000 --> 26:33.000]  Yes.
[26:33.000 --> 26:34.000]  No, it's something else male.
[26:34.000 --> 26:35.000]  Lady MacBulls?
[26:35.000 --> 26:36.000]  Yes.
[26:36.000 --> 26:38.000]  Seeding person?
[26:38.000 --> 26:39.000]  Yes.
[26:39.000 --> 26:40.000]  Seeding person?
[26:40.000 --> 26:41.000]  Is that what I said?
[26:41.000 --> 26:43.000]  No, I just made that up.
[26:43.000 --> 26:47.000]  But I had read at Vox that it's hateful to say biological males.
[26:47.000 --> 26:48.000]  So I don't know.
[26:48.000 --> 26:49.000]  They're a different term.
[26:49.000 --> 26:50.000]  Like Latinx.
[26:50.000 --> 26:51.000]  Go say that to the Latin king.
[26:51.000 --> 26:52.000]  See how it turns out.
[26:52.000 --> 26:53.000]  Yeah.
[26:53.000 --> 26:54.000]  Let us know what the term is.
[26:54.000 --> 26:56.000]  Sooner or later, someone's getting nine teardrop tattoos.
[26:56.000 --> 26:57.000]  They just look like pieros.
[26:57.000 --> 26:59.000]  I used to call them dead.
[26:59.000 --> 27:03.000]  So under SB 132, it allows biological males to use women's locker rooms,
[27:03.000 --> 27:09.000]  homeless shelters, and prisons to the point that now condoms have been
[27:09.000 --> 27:11.000]  issued within the prison.
[27:11.000 --> 27:12.000]  What?
[27:12.000 --> 27:15.000]  Yeah, this is part of the protocol to ensure that sex between inmates,
[27:15.000 --> 27:18.000]  which is illegal, by the way, would be safe.
[27:18.000 --> 27:22.000]  So they need to make sure that it's safe sex in an all females prison
[27:22.000 --> 27:24.000]  where they cannot get pregnant.
[27:24.000 --> 27:31.000]  And so all women condoms.
[27:31.000 --> 27:33.000]  Pregnancy.
[27:33.000 --> 27:35.000]  Immaculate conception?
[27:35.000 --> 27:43.000]  Do not be afraid.
[27:43.000 --> 27:47.000]  For behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy,
[27:47.000 --> 27:49.000]  which will be to all people.
[27:49.000 --> 27:52.000]  For there is born to you a baby in this cell.
[27:52.000 --> 27:55.000]  And this shall be a sign unto you all.
[27:55.000 --> 27:56.000]  A virgin birth?
[27:56.000 --> 27:57.000]  A miracle?
[27:57.000 --> 27:58.000]  No.
[27:58.000 --> 28:03.000]  Your cellmate, that guy dresses a woman.
[28:03.000 --> 28:05.000]  He's going to rape you.
[28:05.000 --> 28:08.000]  I'm a girl.
[28:08.000 --> 28:13.000]  Repeatedly.
[28:13.000 --> 28:15.000]  That read rough on the paper.
[28:15.000 --> 28:16.000]  It really did.
[28:16.000 --> 28:18.000]  And who could have seen this coming?
[28:18.000 --> 28:22.000]  Good old Alex Jones.
[28:22.000 --> 28:23.000]  He did a great job.
[28:23.000 --> 28:24.000]  I don't apologize for it.
[28:24.000 --> 28:27.000]  I see a whole conner remake where prisoners just try to get swapped over
[28:27.000 --> 28:29.000]  to the women's prison.
[28:29.000 --> 28:30.000]  We're not trying to get free.
[28:30.000 --> 28:31.000]  Is Alex Jones a net remake?
[28:31.000 --> 28:32.000]  I want to watch it.
[28:32.000 --> 28:35.000]  I would absolutely do a woman's jail instead.
[28:35.000 --> 28:39.000]  They'll recast Nicholas Cage as the new Nicholas Cage with the hair transplant.
[28:39.000 --> 28:40.000]  The drunk one?
[28:40.000 --> 28:41.000]  Yeah.
[28:41.000 --> 28:42.000]  I'm still crazy.
[28:42.000 --> 28:47.000]  I'm still on the plane, but I have more hair.
[28:47.000 --> 28:48.000]  All right.
[28:48.000 --> 28:51.000]  The funniest show on the internet and TV.
[28:51.000 --> 28:56.000]  The good old Steven Crowder coming up on the other side.
[28:56.000 --> 28:57.000]  Stay with us.
[28:57.000 --> 28:58.000]  Hey, everybody.
[28:58.000 --> 29:01.000]  Confused about staying healthy in a crazy COVID culture?
[29:01.000 --> 29:02.000]  Me too.
[29:02.000 --> 29:07.000]  But listen, after all the research, all the conflicting studies, after all the squabbling,
[29:07.000 --> 29:09.000]  there's one thing almost everyone agrees on.
[29:09.000 --> 29:14.000]  It's that immune system health can literally be the difference between life and death.
[29:14.000 --> 29:16.000]  You probably already believe that.
[29:16.000 --> 29:17.000]  I certainly do.
[29:17.000 --> 29:18.000]  So here's the thing.
[29:18.000 --> 29:22.400]  I wanted to get past the craziness and find out which plant-based substances actually
[29:22.400 --> 29:26.500]  have studies that demonstrate some efficacy in immune support.
[29:26.500 --> 29:32.000]  Now, you'll have to sign a waiver, but you can check out what I've discovered at StrongerDefense.com.
[29:32.000 --> 29:34.000]  No cures or treatments there.

[33:48.000 --> 33:51.000]  Well, ladies and gentlemen, we've got him.
[33:51.000 --> 33:59.000]  He is the evil Stephen Crowder censored, ladies and gentlemen, by YouTube yet again for daring
[33:59.000 --> 34:07.000]  to talk about that third rail that is untouchable, that most protected of all groups, men, that
[34:07.000 --> 34:09.000]  are basically taking over women's spaces.
[34:09.000 --> 34:13.000]  And Dave Chappelle dared to say that it's like white guys were in black space pretending
[34:13.000 --> 34:14.000]  to be black.
[34:14.000 --> 34:17.000]  Well, that's what it's like having men saying they're women.
[34:17.000 --> 34:22.000]  So joining us is Stephen Crowder with, of course, his super hit show that's basically
[34:22.000 --> 34:23.000]  everywhere you can find it.
[34:23.000 --> 34:27.000]  And I was really honored to be on with him a few weeks ago in studio up by Dallas.
[34:27.000 --> 34:29.000]  So Stephen, great to have you on.
[34:29.000 --> 34:31.000]  Well, you're the reason that I'm gone.
[34:31.000 --> 34:33.000]  So I guess I'm thanking you.
[34:33.000 --> 34:37.000]  That sketch was, I don't apologize for it.
[34:37.000 --> 34:38.000]  I think it was hysterical.
[34:38.000 --> 34:42.000]  And I think, you know, looking back, I don't know if I would have had you playing Gabriel.
[34:42.000 --> 34:44.000]  That seems to have gotten us into some hot water.
[34:44.000 --> 34:45.000]  Well, absolutely.
[34:45.000 --> 34:47.000]  I mean, my family love it.
[34:47.000 --> 34:48.000]  The listeners love it.
[34:48.000 --> 34:49.000]  The viewers love it.
[34:49.000 --> 34:50.000]  Thanks for letting us play it.
[34:50.000 --> 34:53.000]  Why do you think that upset them so badly?
[34:53.000 --> 34:58.000]  Well, here's the interesting thing, Alex, is there's a carve out on YouTube for comedy
[34:58.000 --> 34:59.000]  to be clear.
[34:59.000 --> 35:02.000]  There is a carve out for comedy as far as protective speech.
[35:02.000 --> 35:08.000]  So this obviously, I think Alex Jones playing the angel Gabriel, letting Mary know in a cell
[35:08.000 --> 35:11.000]  that it won't be a virgin birth, but a trans jet.
[35:11.000 --> 35:16.000]  Look, I don't even need to finish the premise and it's very clearly meant to be a joke.
[35:16.000 --> 35:18.000]  Not only that, Alex, you were here.
[35:18.000 --> 35:21.000]  You know that on that show, the whole joke was we were tiptoeing around the fact that
[35:21.000 --> 35:25.000]  we couldn't even acknowledge the differences between biological men who identifies women
[35:25.000 --> 35:26.000]  versus women.
[35:26.000 --> 35:28.000]  And that's the premise for an immaculate conception.
[35:28.000 --> 35:33.000]  So the whole joke is a not joke that we can't actually make the joke.
[35:33.000 --> 35:37.000]  And the interesting thing, Alex, is I don't know if you guys have the overlays from this,
[35:37.000 --> 35:42.000]  but the lawyer from YouTube, and I said this yesterday, I find some solace in the fact that
[35:42.000 --> 35:49.000]  they're very expensive hourly attorney, sent a letter specifying what infraction we committed.
[35:49.000 --> 35:55.000]  And coincidentally, it happened to go up immediately, just hours after we did an entire show
[35:55.000 --> 35:59.000]  on the Loudoun County situation, you know, the transgender, the boy, sorry, the bisexual boy
[35:59.000 --> 36:02.000]  in a skirt who raped multiple girls in Loudoun County.
[36:02.000 --> 36:05.000]  We got the notification or sorry, the letter from the lawyer immediately afterward.
[36:05.000 --> 36:11.000]  But in there, they said you cannot, and of course, insert here, incite violence, commit hate speech.
[36:11.000 --> 36:18.000]  But then it said, or indicate that transgender individuals may pose a rape threat to women.
[36:18.000 --> 36:23.000]  That language encompasses everything on the topic of bathroom bills.
[36:23.000 --> 36:28.000]  That language, just to be clear, what's so concerning to me is there were 100 parents, right,
[36:28.000 --> 36:32.000]  at Loudoun County, who were protesting the school board because this young girl was raped
[36:32.000 --> 36:35.000]  by a bisexual boy in a skirt. I don't really know what gender they consider that.
[36:35.000 --> 36:40.000]  That's how it was reported. But parents wanted to protest in general saying,
[36:40.000 --> 36:42.000]  well, we are opposed to this. Why are you opposed to this?
[36:42.000 --> 36:48.000]  Parents at a town hall, parents at a PTA meeting, we think that letting biological boys
[36:48.000 --> 36:52.000]  or girls with penises, as you guys call, we think that letting them into the girls' rooms
[36:52.000 --> 36:55.000]  could be a potential rape risk. Boom, banned.
[36:55.000 --> 36:59.000]  You can say it in the real town square, but you can't say it in the digital one.
[36:59.000 --> 37:02.000]  And that is unprecedented, what we're experiencing here.
[37:02.000 --> 37:06.000]  Well, I mean, actually, the father went to protest about the reported rape of his daughter
[37:06.000 --> 37:10.000]  by the man in the skirt, and they did arrest him.
[37:10.000 --> 37:15.000]  They did put him in handcuffs. And so, really, this is out of control.
[37:15.000 --> 37:18.000]  And then we learned he'd been transferred to another school
[37:18.000 --> 37:20.000]  where another rape reportedly happened.
[37:20.000 --> 37:24.000]  And then Yahoo News tried to say it didn't exist, but later had to admit,
[37:24.000 --> 37:27.000]  okay, there are two police reports there have been a arrest.
[37:27.000 --> 37:31.000]  And so, just like the guy out at the spa in LA, the Asian spa,
[37:31.000 --> 37:35.000]  who went into the hot tub with the grandma, the mother, and the nine-year-old girl
[37:35.000 --> 37:40.000]  and, you know, talked about sex, turned out he was a convicted sex offender.
[37:40.000 --> 37:43.000]  And to be clear, I want to be really clear about something here.
[37:43.000 --> 37:47.000]  I have never, ever said that all transgender people are rapists.
[37:47.000 --> 37:52.000]  I've never even said and wouldn't say that most transgender people are racist.
[37:52.000 --> 37:54.000]  Why? Because I don't believe it.
[37:54.000 --> 37:59.000]  Now, I think some are, and I think some, even heterosexual males
[37:59.000 --> 38:04.000]  who are predators will use it as a guise to commit acts of sexual assault.
[38:04.000 --> 38:07.000]  I don't care how someone actually identifies.
[38:07.000 --> 38:12.000]  I care about mitigating the risk of sexual assault in female-only spaces.
[38:12.000 --> 38:16.000]  That's the concern here, and people try to say that it's anti-trans.
[38:16.000 --> 38:19.000]  Now, look, we're at a certain point where it's pro-women.
[38:19.000 --> 38:22.000]  That's really what we're talking about, and this is incredibly concerning.
[38:22.000 --> 38:24.000]  I mean, keep in mind, that guy was vilified.
[38:24.000 --> 38:27.000]  We're talking about the dad whose daughter was raped, okay?
[38:27.000 --> 38:29.000]  Let's be really clear about this. The daughter was raped.
[38:29.000 --> 38:31.000]  Let's put this in context, everybody.
[38:31.000 --> 38:35.000]  The FBI DOJ wants to investigate parents for complaining at town hall meetings.
[38:35.000 --> 38:38.000]  Okay, I want you to put yourself in this guy's shoes.
[38:38.000 --> 38:40.000]  Your daughter's raped.
[38:40.000 --> 38:42.000]  They went, by the way, confirmed by a rape test kit.
[38:42.000 --> 38:45.000]  This isn't just a me-too-bad-date thing. People can look it up, okay?
[38:45.000 --> 38:49.000]  Your daughter's raped. The school board does nothing.
[38:49.000 --> 38:52.000]  You think you do a little bit more than protest angrily?
[38:52.000 --> 38:55.000]  Come on, guys. This is just people trying to sit and judge.
[38:55.000 --> 38:59.000]  When we talk about not being judgmental, how about we put ourselves in the shoes of that dad?
[38:59.000 --> 39:03.000]  You guys are going to judge him as though he's a threat to society because he got unruly,
[39:03.000 --> 39:05.000]  because his daughter was raped.
[39:05.000 --> 39:09.000]  We have entire films that use that as the premise for us to get on board with the good guy.
[39:09.000 --> 39:11.000]  It was called Death Wish.
[39:11.000 --> 39:15.000]  So, it's just amazing to me that we try and act as though both sides of this equation.
[39:15.000 --> 39:17.000]  No, not both sides of this equation.
[39:17.000 --> 39:20.000]  One side, a father's daughter was raped by something that was preventable.
[39:20.000 --> 39:23.000]  The school did nothing about it. They didn't want to acknowledge it.
[39:23.000 --> 39:26.000]  And this is what they always do, right? They say, well, hold on a second.
[39:26.000 --> 39:32.000]  You can acknowledge specific instances of a sexual assault where it's happened,
[39:32.000 --> 39:34.000]  and then they say, but it's never happened.
[39:34.000 --> 39:37.000]  Just like I said at the school board, well, you can't make any broad generalizations,
[39:37.000 --> 39:41.000]  which is what would be required to oppose this policy before it happens, right?
[39:41.000 --> 39:46.000]  And they say, but you're allowed to cite specific examples and individuals,
[39:46.000 --> 39:48.000]  and then you go to the school board and say, okay, what about this?
[39:48.000 --> 39:49.000]  They said that never happened.
[39:49.000 --> 39:51.000]  That's the issue that we're talking about.
[39:51.000 --> 39:54.000]  When you talk about the California state prison system, you say, okay, what about these pregnancies?
[39:54.000 --> 39:55.000]  Well, that never happened.
[39:55.000 --> 39:58.000]  We don't have evidence that it was from a transgender individual.
[39:58.000 --> 40:00.000]  We just know a woman got pregnant in prison.
[40:00.000 --> 40:01.000]  Oh, okay. All right.
[40:01.000 --> 40:03.000]  Well, I thought we were following the science.
[40:03.000 --> 40:05.000]  So, my mistake.
[40:05.000 --> 40:06.000]  Well, I know this.
[40:06.000 --> 40:12.000]  We're playing a clip from the famous Alfred Hitchcock film, Psycho,
[40:12.000 --> 40:17.000]  with Norman Bates dressed as his mother who had dead stuff in the basement with cabbage leaves.
[40:17.000 --> 40:22.000]  And so all I'm saying is we've known throughout culture and history that a lot of crazy people,
[40:22.000 --> 40:25.000]  both in fiction and nonfiction, like to dress up as women.
[40:25.000 --> 40:30.000]  Also, a lot of pedophiles like to dress up as women to trick children into their white raper vans.
[40:30.000 --> 40:31.000]  I mean, this has all come out.
[40:31.000 --> 40:37.000]  So there's this leftist Hollywood fetish with men dressing up like women coming after women and children.
[40:37.000 --> 40:42.000]  And there is a certain percentage of predators that want to be able to hide in restrooms
[40:42.000 --> 40:45.000]  and when women come in, rape them, and it's happening all over the world.
[40:45.000 --> 40:51.000]  And so the fact that that's happening is real and the left is trying to cover it up.
[40:51.000 --> 40:53.000]  Well, let's also be clear about something with the rules.
[40:53.000 --> 40:57.000]  There are also plenty of men who dress up like women who don't identify as women.
[40:57.000 --> 40:58.000]  I mean, think of Hoover, right?
[40:58.000 --> 41:00.000]  There are plenty of men who have done this in the past.
[41:00.000 --> 41:07.000]  And the issue here now is it's kind of difficult to tell, honestly, for someone a layman to go, OK,
[41:07.000 --> 41:12.000]  this person is simply a man who just like a cross-dresser, but this person is transgender.
[41:12.000 --> 41:18.000]  This person is transsexual because most transgender individuals don't go through with the bottom surgery.
[41:18.000 --> 41:20.000]  A lot of them don't go through with the top surgery.
[41:20.000 --> 41:22.000]  They simply dress and identify as women.
[41:22.000 --> 41:27.000]  But it would be considered grossly offensive to imply that they are a cross-dresser or transvestite,
[41:27.000 --> 41:30.000]  which at one point was just sort of something that people did.
[41:30.000 --> 41:35.000]  So the issue here is really it's the elimination of gender lines,
[41:35.000 --> 41:38.000]  the elimination of this idea that men and women are fundamentally different.
[41:38.000 --> 41:43.000]  The idea that children do best ideally in a household with a mother and a father.
[41:43.000 --> 41:45.000]  And I want to be clear about this, too.
[41:45.000 --> 41:51.000]  I think, look, when you're talking about a group of transgender individuals who have a 40-plus attempted suicide rate
[41:51.000 --> 41:55.000]  between 41 and 42, and then it's about the same thing post-op,
[41:55.000 --> 41:58.000]  I do think that there needs to be compassion for these groups of people.
[41:58.000 --> 41:59.000]  Absolutely.
[41:59.000 --> 42:02.000]  Because no other group has an attempted suicide rate.
[42:02.000 --> 42:06.000]  American slaves didn't have a 41 to 42-percent attempted suicide rate,
[42:06.000 --> 42:09.000]  which tells me, again, I think some transgender individuals are treated horribly,
[42:09.000 --> 42:10.000]  and I would never do that.
[42:10.000 --> 42:14.000]  But they're not, as a whole, treated worse than American slaves,
[42:14.000 --> 42:18.000]  which may suggest there's something internally that we can help with.
[42:18.000 --> 42:19.000]  Absolutely.
[42:19.000 --> 42:20.000]  Stay right there.
[42:20.000 --> 42:22.000]  Steven Crowder is trying to help people, so am I.
[42:22.000 --> 42:26.000]  I'm not enemies with men that are confused, but there are predators posing as women,
[42:26.000 --> 42:28.000]  and the left is defending it.
[42:28.000 --> 42:29.000]  Why are they defending it?
[42:29.000 --> 42:31.000]  How do we stop this nightmare?
[42:31.000 --> 42:33.000]  Where is all this going?
[42:33.000 --> 42:36.000]  Straight ahead with Steven Crowder, who I don't hear saying hate.
[42:36.000 --> 42:39.000]  I hear him saying truth, and that's why they want to silence him,
[42:39.000 --> 42:41.000]  because they want to silence all of us.
[42:41.000 --> 42:42.000]  We'll be right back.
[42:44.000 --> 42:49.000]  The globalists are bombarding us with propaganda and with spiritual warfare
[42:49.000 --> 42:53.000]  and with poisons and chemicals added to the food, it's all come out.
[42:53.000 --> 42:55.000]  And they're doing that not because we're weak,
[42:55.000 --> 43:00.000]  but because we're made the image of God, the Creator, and we are powerful.
[43:00.000 --> 43:03.000]  And the social engineers fear that so much.
[43:03.000 --> 43:08.000]  So that's why I repeat that famous Internet saying that nobody knows who first came up with the boy,
[43:08.000 --> 43:10.000]  is it true?
[43:11.000 --> 43:17.000]  The propaganda would not be necessary if the situation was hopeless.
[43:17.000 --> 43:20.000]  They need all their propaganda, and all their lies, and all their evil,
[43:20.000 --> 43:25.000]  and all their cultural death, because they know we are strong.
[43:25.000 --> 43:29.000]  And they know in the end they signed on to the God of this world, who is a loser.
[43:29.000 --> 43:33.000]  And that's why it's so important that everybody keep in full wars in the air now more than ever.
[43:33.000 --> 43:39.000]  Because even if you don't believe in God, what the globalists are manifesting and setting up is satanic.
[43:39.000 --> 43:43.000]  And we are opposing the one world government and the mark of the beast they just announced.
[43:43.000 --> 43:49.000]  One of the most studied and researched areas of human health and physiology is inflammation.
[43:49.000 --> 43:55.000]  It's associated with cancer, it's associated with joint problems, it's associated with viral infections,
[43:55.000 --> 43:57.000]  bacterial infections, it's associated with death.
[43:57.000 --> 44:02.000]  And out of all the incredible compounds that God gave us through nature that fights inflammation
[44:02.000 --> 44:06.000]  and makes our lives better, turmeric is chief amongst them all.
[44:06.000 --> 44:11.000]  And chief amongst all the turmeric products out there is body's ultimate turmeric formula.
[44:11.000 --> 44:15.000]  My wife loves turmeric, she has joint pain, but she has to take a lot of it, the type of stuff
[44:15.000 --> 44:17.000]  she buys at the grocery store for it to work.
[44:17.000 --> 44:20.000]  She started taking this and said, I only need to take one pill instead of four.
[44:20.000 --> 44:26.000]  Why is it so good? It's not just turmeric, it's concentrated with the proprietary process.
[44:26.000 --> 44:33.000]  It's back in stock and for being sold out almost five months at infowarstore.com for 40% off.

[45:42.000 --> 45:44.000]  We're running this special for one week.
[45:48.000 --> 45:50.000]  Jacob in Ohio, welcome, go ahead.
[45:50.000 --> 45:51.000]  Hey, how's it going, Alex?
[45:51.000 --> 45:52.000]  Good.
[45:52.000 --> 45:53.000]  Great last caller.
[45:53.000 --> 45:56.000]  I just wanted to start with plugging your sleep supplements.
[45:56.000 --> 46:01.000]  It's basically the only way I get to sleep anymore with all the gaslighting, moralization and absurdity.
[46:01.000 --> 46:03.000]  It's like we're living in a twilight zone.
[46:03.000 --> 46:05.000]  Alright, Eric's in New Hampshire.
[46:05.000 --> 46:07.000]  Eric, thanks for calling, go ahead.
[46:07.000 --> 46:08.000]  Hey, Alex, thanks for taking my call.
[46:08.000 --> 46:11.000]  If I could, I just want to throw a quick plug out for one of the products.
[46:11.000 --> 46:13.000]  The X2 does wonders.
[46:13.000 --> 46:15.000]  They recommend it to everybody here on the fence about it.
[46:15.000 --> 46:18.000]  Get off the fence, get the product, support the infowar.
[46:18.000 --> 46:20.000]  Tyler in Maine, you're on the air.
[46:20.000 --> 46:21.000]  Thanks for rolling, go ahead.
[46:21.000 --> 46:23.000]  Hey, Alex, it's great to be on with you.
[46:23.000 --> 46:24.000]  It's an honor.
[46:24.000 --> 46:25.000]  Honored to talk to you.
[46:25.000 --> 46:26.000]  Awesome.
[46:26.000 --> 46:29.000]  So, first thing I wanted to do was say I love the products.
[46:29.000 --> 46:33.000]  Alpha Power, even at 29, if you ask my better half, she loves it.
[46:33.000 --> 46:35.000]  Alright, it helps in the bedroom.
[46:35.000 --> 46:37.000]  So, just number one for a few of you.
[46:37.000 --> 46:38.000]  It definitely works.
[46:38.000 --> 46:39.000]  It's not a joke.
[46:39.000 --> 47:05.000]  Absolutely.
[47:09.000 --> 47:21.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is the Alex Jones show.
[47:21.000 --> 47:25.000]  And I'm really honored that you've joined us on this October 19th, 2021
[47:25.000 --> 47:26.000]  transmission.
[47:26.000 --> 47:29.000]  We've got Steven Crowder on who is being mean to women.
[47:29.000 --> 47:30.000]  He's a bully.
[47:30.000 --> 47:32.000]  He gangs up on girls.
[47:32.000 --> 47:37.000]  And he's, he did a piece criticizing biological men, women, in
[47:37.000 --> 47:39.000]  presence getting other women pregnant.
[47:39.000 --> 47:40.000]  We know it.
[47:40.000 --> 47:43.000]  All it takes is two women to have a baby.
[47:43.000 --> 47:47.000]  And so, you were finishing up with the fact that, societally, what are we
[47:47.000 --> 47:48.000]  going to do about this?
[47:48.000 --> 47:51.000]  Because, yeah, other men that have a proclivity to feel like they're
[47:51.000 --> 47:54.000]  women and some are, I'm aphroditic and so, okay, you're a woman.
[47:54.000 --> 47:55.000]  Fine, I don't hate you.
[47:55.000 --> 47:56.000]  I'm not attacking you.
[47:56.000 --> 47:58.000]  That's my genuine feelings as well.
[47:58.000 --> 48:01.000]  But what are they going to do about all the predators that are
[48:01.000 --> 48:03.000]  basically in charge of their movement?
[48:03.000 --> 48:05.000]  This is, this is, this is going to cause quite an explosion.
[48:05.000 --> 48:07.000]  I think it already is.
[48:07.000 --> 48:08.000]  Yeah.
[48:08.000 --> 48:10.000]  And there's, by the way, there's a big rift in the feminist movement.
[48:10.000 --> 48:13.000]  The women's, I think, liberation front, Lear Keith, who I had on the show
[48:13.000 --> 48:17.000]  maybe seven years ago because she was a former vegan, I believe, is at
[48:17.000 --> 48:18.000]  work with this.
[48:18.000 --> 48:20.000]  So there are feminists now who are reaching out and saying, you
[48:20.000 --> 48:22.000]  know what, I disagree with a lot of the things that you've said in the
[48:22.000 --> 48:24.000]  past, but I, I understand it.
[48:24.000 --> 48:27.000]  Look, you know, this is something that I, what I think is important for
[48:27.000 --> 48:31.000]  people to note is it's, I'm sorry, it's the fault of suburban white
[48:31.000 --> 48:32.000]  women.
[48:32.000 --> 48:33.000]  I blame you.
[48:33.000 --> 48:34.000]  People don't understand this.
[48:34.000 --> 48:36.000]  When you talk about transgender individuals in sports, for
[48:36.000 --> 48:39.000]  example, okay, biological men going into women's sports, most women
[48:39.000 --> 48:40.000]  support it.
[48:40.000 --> 48:42.000]  Most men oppose it.
[48:42.000 --> 48:45.000]  Time and time again, even though we don't have a dog in the fight.
[48:45.000 --> 48:48.000]  Now, the reason we oppose it is not because we hate transgender
[48:48.000 --> 48:49.000]  individuals.
[48:49.000 --> 48:53.000]  It's for the same reason that we don't want to see men beating up on
[48:53.000 --> 48:54.000]  women.
[48:54.000 --> 48:55.000]  It's quite that simple.
[48:55.000 --> 48:57.000]  So look, let's just look at it this way.
[48:57.000 --> 48:59.000]  Let's remove the label when we're talking about the bathroom situation
[48:59.000 --> 49:03.000]  of transgender, whatever it is, it's just, okay, let's say I'm a sexual
[49:03.000 --> 49:06.000]  predator, right, and I'm attracted to women.
[49:06.000 --> 49:07.000]  Let's just assume that for a second.
[49:07.000 --> 49:12.000]  And I could be a straight white male, or I could be a male to female
[49:12.000 --> 49:15.000]  transgender lesbian slash your guess is as good as mine.
[49:15.000 --> 49:18.000]  Let's just not get too, let's not get too nerdy on the math here.
[49:18.000 --> 49:23.000]  What's the best way to remove opportunity of getting vulnerable women
[49:23.000 --> 49:27.000]  alone is making sure we protect some women only spaces.
[49:27.000 --> 49:28.000]  That's it.
[49:28.000 --> 49:29.000]  That's all it is.
[49:29.000 --> 49:32.000]  And if you're pro women, you have to understand where people are
[49:32.000 --> 49:33.000]  coming from with that.
[49:33.000 --> 49:39.000]  Let's stop calling the insinuation that having women only spaces should
[49:39.000 --> 49:40.000]  all.
[49:40.000 --> 49:43.000]  So let's use the term no penis spaces.
[49:43.000 --> 49:44.000]  Is that okay?
[49:44.000 --> 49:45.000]  Can we use that?
[49:45.000 --> 49:46.000]  Can I say that on radio?
[49:46.000 --> 49:47.000]  I can say penis, right?
[49:47.000 --> 49:48.000]  Because it's medically.
[49:48.000 --> 49:49.000]  No penis spaces.
[49:49.000 --> 49:50.000]  That's it.
[49:50.000 --> 49:54.000]  I am pro everyone and pro no penises in women's only spaces.
[49:54.000 --> 49:55.000]  It's a penis free space.
[49:55.000 --> 49:57.000]  I mean, now the colleges have white free spaces where no whites are allowed
[49:57.000 --> 49:59.000]  to go or people, you know, need these bastions.
[49:59.000 --> 50:01.000]  Can't women have no penis spaces?
[50:01.000 --> 50:02.000]  Like women have.
[50:02.000 --> 50:05.000]  You would think women have gyms that are just for women.
[50:05.000 --> 50:08.000]  And I get that so they can go be left alone and not to worry how they look
[50:08.000 --> 50:10.000]  for men and men have their own gyms.
[50:10.000 --> 50:12.000]  There's nothing wrong with that.
[50:12.000 --> 50:13.000]  Actually, I haven't.
[50:13.000 --> 50:15.000]  The truth is I don't think there are many.
[50:15.000 --> 50:17.000]  I don't think there are many male only gyms.
[50:17.000 --> 50:18.000]  Those just are gay nightclubs.
[50:18.000 --> 50:22.000]  So it's very, very rare because I've looked for them because the truth is
[50:22.000 --> 50:26.000]  now if you go to men and I actually think it's a good idea like curves.
[50:26.000 --> 50:29.000]  I understand it because women feel vulnerable, right?
[50:29.000 --> 50:30.000]  They feel self conscious.
[50:30.000 --> 50:31.000]  I'm actually pro curves.
[50:31.000 --> 50:35.000]  And sometimes I would like a male only gym where it doesn't scare women
[50:35.000 --> 50:37.000]  if you drop a barbell.
[50:37.000 --> 50:38.000]  That's all.
[50:38.000 --> 50:39.000]  I think that it should go well.
[50:39.000 --> 50:40.000]  I totally agree.
[50:40.000 --> 50:41.000]  I mean, exactly.
[50:41.000 --> 50:45.000]  That's why guys go out to the deer camp so they can drink whiskey, chew tobacco and cuss.
[50:45.000 --> 50:50.000]  I do know three of those things, but I like to paint with watercolors.
[50:50.000 --> 50:52.000]  So I think I understand where you're coming from.
[50:52.000 --> 50:53.000]  Exactly.
[50:53.000 --> 50:54.000]  Yeah.
[50:54.000 --> 50:56.000]  We're both equally manly is my point, Alex.
[50:56.000 --> 51:00.000]  No, look, and this is the elimination of to give you an example.
[51:00.000 --> 51:02.000]  You know, Dave Rubin is someone who have had my show.
[51:02.000 --> 51:04.000]  People know Dave Rubin is a gay sort of libertarian.
[51:04.000 --> 51:07.000]  And I spoke with him a long time ago about gay marriage.
[51:07.000 --> 51:10.000]  And he was very surprised because when I met Dave, I gave him a big hug.
[51:10.000 --> 51:11.000]  And I really do.
[51:11.000 --> 51:12.000]  He's just a really nice guy.
[51:12.000 --> 51:13.000]  And I do.
[51:13.000 --> 51:14.000]  I genuinely love Dave Rubin.
[51:14.000 --> 51:18.000]  I try and reflect the love that Christ has given to me because I don't deserve it.
[51:18.000 --> 51:21.000]  And you're having a baby when he's six months pregnant, right?
[51:21.000 --> 51:22.000]  Yes.
[51:22.000 --> 51:24.000]  And we plan on chest feeding just to be clear.
[51:24.000 --> 51:25.000]  No simulac for us.
[51:25.000 --> 51:27.000]  I don't trust what they put in there.
[51:27.000 --> 51:28.000]  Lead or something.
[51:28.000 --> 51:32.000]  You saw a blood judge and his husband in the bed of the maternity ward.
[51:32.000 --> 51:33.000]  I know.
[51:33.000 --> 51:34.000]  I know.
[51:34.000 --> 51:35.000]  And I just had twins.
[51:35.000 --> 51:36.000]  So believe me, I know too much.
[51:36.000 --> 51:37.000]  Here's the best part.
[51:37.000 --> 51:40.000]  He took two months off and no one even noticed.
[51:40.000 --> 51:44.000]  So that just tells you how useless most roles are in government.
[51:44.000 --> 51:45.000]  But here's the deal.
[51:45.000 --> 51:48.000]  What's funny to me to go on down this path, okay?
[51:48.000 --> 51:51.000]  Because Tucker Carlson said something about breastfeeding.
[51:51.000 --> 51:57.000]  And then he responded, Pete Buttgig, very snippily on CNN saying, I guess Tucker hasn't heard
[51:57.000 --> 51:58.000]  of bottle feeding.
[51:58.000 --> 51:59.000]  No, no, no.
[51:59.000 --> 52:04.000]  We wouldn't assume that all men bottle feed because you have told us that men can breastfeed
[52:04.000 --> 52:05.000]  too.
[52:05.000 --> 52:09.000]  We just showed a video of that today on the show of transgender men breastfeeding.
[52:09.000 --> 52:14.000]  So this is the problem now is the left can't even agree to their own premises.
[52:14.000 --> 52:18.000]  Pete Buttigieg is trying to say, of course we know men can't breastfeed.
[52:18.000 --> 52:19.000]  Well, guess what?
[52:19.000 --> 52:25.000]  Fox and Buzzfeed and CNN and NBC say that some men can breastfeed.
[52:25.000 --> 52:32.000]  And AOC says that the cauliflower is racist because it's white.
[52:32.000 --> 52:33.000]  That's not a joke.
[52:33.000 --> 52:37.000]  By the way, folks, we missed that seriously, though, pulling back from that.
[52:37.000 --> 52:38.000]  Did she actually say that?
[52:38.000 --> 52:39.000]  Did she actually say that?
[52:39.000 --> 52:43.000]  Yeah, she said we shouldn't be growing at the inner city gardens cauliflower.
[52:43.000 --> 52:45.000]  That's a white food.
[52:45.000 --> 52:50.000]  Oh, well, she was looking at a cross side, so she probably didn't know what she was
[52:50.000 --> 52:51.000]  talking about.
[52:51.000 --> 52:52.000]  Exactly.
[52:52.000 --> 52:54.000]  And she also said the world's ending in 2030.
[52:54.000 --> 52:55.000]  Yeah.
[52:55.000 --> 52:56.000]  Well, look, here's the thing.
[52:56.000 --> 52:57.000]  AOC is an idiot.
[52:57.000 --> 53:01.760]  And I don't want to just use ad hominem, but read the Green New Deal.
[53:01.760 --> 53:04.000]  You can read it more quickly than the pan flip.
[53:04.000 --> 53:09.000]  They give you a discount tire and I think you kind of understand everything you need
[53:09.000 --> 53:12.000]  to know if she actually said that this is the first time hearing about it.
[53:12.000 --> 53:18.000]  Cauliflower, you know what cauliflower is one of those things that should bridge all racial
[53:18.000 --> 53:19.000]  divide.
[53:19.000 --> 53:25.000]  Yes, also heroin, by the way, heroin is one thing that white people and black people
[53:25.000 --> 53:26.000]  do equally.
[53:26.000 --> 53:27.000]  You have certain drugs that are bigger.
[53:27.000 --> 53:30.000]  Certain areas where you had the crack epidemic, which was largely African-American.
[53:30.000 --> 53:33.000]  A lot of the capitol floggers remember a few years ago they were saying milk is racist
[53:33.000 --> 53:37.000]  because it's white, but pulling back from the Stephen Crowder, let's get back to the
[53:37.000 --> 53:38.000]  transgenderism.
[53:38.000 --> 53:39.000]  I played for TV viewers.
[53:39.000 --> 53:44.000]  You obviously couldn't see it, the American psycho or psycho clip from Alfred Hitchcock
[53:44.000 --> 53:47.000]  of the man dressed up as the woman going around killing people.
[53:47.000 --> 53:52.000]  But what about even in silence of the lambs where it's a transgender that's got the woman
[53:52.000 --> 53:56.000]  down in the pit trying to get her to put lotion on the skin?
[53:56.000 --> 54:01.000]  Why do we art typally and just think of a man dressed up as a woman as kind of a psycho?
[54:01.000 --> 54:03.000]  Because we've actually seen that in the real world.
[54:03.000 --> 54:05.000]  That's why art's imitating life.
[54:05.000 --> 54:08.000]  What do you think about that phenomenon?
[54:08.000 --> 54:11.000]  I don't know about that phenomenon.
[54:11.000 --> 54:14.000]  I know that we've seen it in films and obviously the trans community opposes it, but I also
[54:14.000 --> 54:20.000]  think that the reason why it's been portrayed that way, I will say historically, for example,
[54:20.000 --> 54:22.000]  let's just let people make their own judgments.
[54:22.000 --> 54:26.000]  I will say the reason why black people were portrayed a certain way may have been because
[54:26.000 --> 54:28.000]  of racism at these points in history, but I will say this.
[54:28.000 --> 54:34.000]  The reason why a lot of serial killers were portrayed that way or villains is because
[54:34.000 --> 54:39.000]  it's seen as abnormal. What do you mean? Atypical against the norm? Rare.
[54:39.000 --> 54:43.000]  That's why a man dressing up as a woman is rare and it was seen as abnormal.
[54:43.000 --> 54:48.000]  And there's a big push right now to not only make sure that that is seen as the exact same as a biological woman,
[54:48.000 --> 54:51.000]  but so is a man breastfeeding a child.
[54:51.000 --> 54:53.000]  And you know what? Science really does matter.
[54:53.000 --> 54:56.000]  When people say follow the science while we're talking about vaccines, for example,
[54:56.000 --> 54:59.000]  when people say follow the science, by that what they mean is fouching.
[54:59.000 --> 55:00.000]  I don't want to get into that. I'm not a doctor.
[55:00.000 --> 55:02.000]  I think people have the right to make their own decisions.
[55:02.000 --> 55:04.000]  What really does matter is they say follow the science.
[55:04.000 --> 55:09.000]  Okay, when it comes to the idea of men chestfeeding, the term they use,
[55:09.000 --> 55:12.000]  how about you follow, are we going to follow the science here?
[55:12.000 --> 55:15.000]  Because if you do that, the child will die.
[55:15.000 --> 55:18.000]  It doesn't matter how you feel. You chestfeed, you breastfeed, you're a man,
[55:18.000 --> 55:21.000]  you're a baby, the baby's going to die.
[55:21.000 --> 55:23.000]  That's the science.
[55:23.000 --> 55:26.000]  So at what point, just like with fouching and AIDS, people don't know this.
[55:26.000 --> 55:29.000]  I'm sure your audience does, obviously, Alex,
[55:29.000 --> 55:33.000]  but the right to try this term that people talk about,
[55:33.000 --> 55:38.000]  that came to popularity under Fauci with gay men who had AIDS.
[55:38.000 --> 55:40.000]  And for example, there's Dallas Buyers Club,
[55:40.000 --> 55:42.000]  where they wanted to be able to use off-label medications.
[55:42.000 --> 55:45.000]  And Fauci blocked it and made them take AZT that killed them.
[55:45.000 --> 55:47.000]  And they wanted the right to try.
[55:47.000 --> 55:51.000]  Things like basic immunosuppressants, anabolic steroids for wasting diseases,
[55:51.000 --> 55:55.000]  marijuana for appetite, right? And Fauci said no, AZT,
[55:55.000 --> 55:57.000]  and they said, we just want the right to try.
[55:57.000 --> 56:00.000]  That's a good deal. Back then, Fauci, and this is political correctness,
[56:00.000 --> 56:04.000]  wanted to make sure that he didn't hurt any gay men's feelings, right?
[56:04.000 --> 56:08.000]  He said there is no connection between the homosexual lifestyle
[56:08.000 --> 56:11.000]  and the outbreak of AIDS. He said one in five heterosexual couples
[56:11.000 --> 56:14.000]  would be affected by AIDS before 1995, I believe.
[56:14.000 --> 56:19.000]  So Fauci, in the name of science, wanted to avoid hurting gay men's feelings.
[56:19.000 --> 56:23.000]  I don't want more gay men to die.
[56:23.000 --> 56:25.000]  You guys determine who's the bad guy.
[56:25.000 --> 56:28.000]  Well, you're absolutely right, but if you pull back with Fauci,
[56:28.000 --> 56:30.000]  it's worse than that. They knew there were all those treatments.
[56:30.000 --> 56:33.000]  That's why Magic Johnson sort of taken AZT, felt sick,
[56:33.000 --> 56:35.000]  and he said, I'm done, he's still alive today.
[56:35.000 --> 56:38.000]  Everybody else took the AZT that Fauci brought back, just like...
[56:38.000 --> 56:44.000]  By the way, by the way, Magic Johnson, straight as an arrow.
[56:44.000 --> 56:48.000]  Well, I'm not sure about that, but who knows?
[56:48.000 --> 56:53.000]  I mean, I know this, black people can get HIV a lot easier than white people
[56:53.000 --> 56:55.000]  according to studies because of the receptor science.
[56:55.000 --> 56:57.000]  Let's just move on, Alex. I will just...
[56:57.000 --> 56:59.000]  That's the science, straight as an arrow.
[56:59.000 --> 57:01.000]  Okay, we're going to go to break with Stephen Crowder,
[57:01.000 --> 57:04.000]  one more little segment with him, and then he's literally going to a Bible study.
[57:04.000 --> 57:07.000]  And he's got an amazing wife and two great twins,
[57:07.000 --> 57:11.000]  and has one of the funniest shows in the world that I'm very, very envious of.
[57:11.000 --> 57:13.000]  I mean, seriously, folks, you do an hour and a half live,
[57:13.000 --> 57:17.000]  four weeks a day, no, no, four weeks a day, four days a week,
[57:17.000 --> 57:21.000]  and it's really super funny, because he hardly ever messes up like I just did.
[57:21.000 --> 57:23.000]  It's live! That's pretty amazing.
[57:23.000 --> 57:25.000]  So I'm a big fan of the Stephen Crowder show.
[57:25.000 --> 57:52.000]  We'll be right back on the other side in two minutes.
[57:56.000 --> 58:01.000]  And chief amongst their physical attacks is keeping us from high quality vitamins
[58:01.000 --> 58:04.000]  and minerals that are essential for life on this planet.
[58:04.000 --> 58:08.000]  And so the information we cover exposes their evil works
[58:08.000 --> 58:10.000]  and sabotages their globalist takeover,
[58:10.000 --> 58:14.000]  and we're having an incredible effect thanks to your support and your word of mouth.
[58:14.000 --> 58:17.000]  But it's also important to take care of our bodies themselves

[59:37.000 --> 59:40.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[59:50.000 --> 59:53.000]  Well, it's the final segment with Steven Crowder,
[59:53.000 --> 59:56.000]  one of the busiest guys in the fight for liberty out there.
[59:56.000 --> 59:58.000]  And he's constantly in the news every day,
[59:58.000 --> 1:00:03.000]  and I'm a fan, I listen almost every day, so does my son, so does my oldest daughter.
[1:00:03.000 --> 1:00:07.000]  Country music legend Travis Tritt, boycotts, any venue or promoter,
[1:00:07.000 --> 1:00:11.000]  mandating mass requiring vaccinations or pushing COVID testing,
[1:00:11.000 --> 1:00:15.000]  and I'm reading the article like 5 a.m. this morning when I woke up on infowars.com,
[1:00:15.000 --> 1:00:18.000]  and I go, wait a minute, that's Steven Crowder.
[1:00:18.000 --> 1:00:21.000]  I didn't watch on Monday, I missed that, damn.
[1:00:21.000 --> 1:00:23.000]  And so here's a clip of what he had to say,
[1:00:23.000 --> 1:00:26.000]  you know, big deal getting the Country Music Star on, but Travis Tritt is really alive,
[1:00:26.000 --> 1:00:29.000]  has a lot of courage, and just the whole interview that I ended up watching this morning,
[1:00:29.000 --> 1:00:32.000]  Tom, I didn't have it, I watched it, was amazing here, it's part of it.
[1:00:32.000 --> 1:00:37.000]  You gave the statement not too long ago about how important our freedoms and our liberties are.
[1:00:37.000 --> 1:00:42.000]  I'm kind of surprised that you would think it wouldn't be that big of a risk in the country music community.
[1:00:42.000 --> 1:00:47.000]  Sometimes I'm surprised that some of the ass-kissing that seemed to take place in the country community
[1:00:47.000 --> 1:00:52.000]  to the media elites, because what you said, a lot of people supported it, a lot of people didn't.
[1:00:52.000 --> 1:00:53.000]  I'm sure I'm not giving you any news.
[1:00:53.000 --> 1:00:57.000]  Can you tell people who missed it and why you felt you wanted to speak out about this?
[1:00:57.000 --> 1:01:08.000]  Well, basically, when Eric Clapton made the statement about the freedoms being fringed upon,
[1:01:08.000 --> 1:01:16.000]  that really resonated with me, and I basically agreed with him across the board,
[1:01:16.000 --> 1:01:25.000]  aside from the personal effects that he had had from getting the vaccine,
[1:01:25.000 --> 1:01:35.000]  but I just agreed just from a philosophical standpoint about we have to preserve our freedoms.
[1:01:35.000 --> 1:01:41.000]  We've never been in a situation that I know of in this country
[1:01:41.000 --> 1:01:51.000]  where the government has been allowed to force you to take medicine that you may or may not need.
[1:01:51.000 --> 1:01:56.000]  And the whole interview is amazing, and what he said to the Daily Wire is powerful.
[1:01:56.000 --> 1:02:01.000]  I mean, it's great to see all these people that have politically not been too active,
[1:02:01.000 --> 1:02:04.000]  really being now forced to come out and being so eloquent.
[1:02:04.000 --> 1:02:09.000]  So I'm just, you know, so much support to what Travis Tritt did.
[1:02:09.000 --> 1:02:11.000]  Yeah, and by the way, I'm sorry, I had some audio problems.
[1:02:11.000 --> 1:02:12.000]  Can you guys all hear me now?
[1:02:12.000 --> 1:02:13.000]  Yes, sir, we can hear you.
[1:02:13.000 --> 1:02:14.000]  Okay, good.
[1:02:14.000 --> 1:02:16.000]  You know what, Alex?
[1:02:16.000 --> 1:02:22.000]  I got to tell you, this is the first, I mean, it kind of breaks my heart that Rolling Stone, I guess, went after Travis Tritt.
[1:02:22.000 --> 1:02:26.000]  Because this is something, and you know my heart, and people know this,
[1:02:26.000 --> 1:02:29.000]  like I've talked about how you and I disagree a lot and we agree on a whole lot too,
[1:02:29.000 --> 1:02:31.000]  and you know that after the YouTube, the deep platforming,
[1:02:31.000 --> 1:02:37.000]  I probably didn't agree with you on as much as some people who I felt abandoned you,
[1:02:37.000 --> 1:02:39.000]  people who didn't stand for you.
[1:02:39.000 --> 1:02:41.000]  I just thought like, oh my gosh, if you tell me that I can't have someone on,
[1:02:41.000 --> 1:02:43.000]  I have to have them on and did it right away.
[1:02:43.000 --> 1:02:46.000]  But one thing that I always try and be really careful of,
[1:02:46.000 --> 1:02:48.000]  and I actually have a reputation in this industry,
[1:02:48.000 --> 1:02:53.000]  I don't ever appear at organization events like nonprofits.
[1:02:53.000 --> 1:02:54.000]  I don't do CPAC anymore.
[1:02:54.000 --> 1:02:55.000]  I used to host it.
[1:02:55.000 --> 1:02:56.000]  I did it for four years.
[1:02:56.000 --> 1:03:00.000]  I don't do any of that anymore because I never want someone else to be on the hook for what I say.
[1:03:00.000 --> 1:03:03.000]  And I also don't want to be on the hook for what someone else says.
[1:03:03.000 --> 1:03:04.000]  I speak for myself.
[1:03:04.000 --> 1:03:08.000]  And I really, with that interview, because Travis Tritt isn't inherently a political guy,
[1:03:08.000 --> 1:03:09.000]  and I'm a huge fan.
[1:03:09.000 --> 1:03:11.000]  I mean, Great Day to Be Alive is one of my all-time favorite songs.
[1:03:11.000 --> 1:03:14.000]  It's my first song on my playlist on vacation.
[1:03:14.000 --> 1:03:18.000]  I thought he was misrepresented before he appeared on my show
[1:03:18.000 --> 1:03:22.000]  and wanted to give him the opportunity to make sure it was crystal clear.
[1:03:22.000 --> 1:03:26.000]  And everything that he said was reasonable, was loving,
[1:03:26.000 --> 1:03:31.000]  and it just breaks my heart that Rolling Stone is distorting it.
[1:03:31.000 --> 1:03:34.000]  There's nothing that Travis Tritt said that anyone could disagree with.
[1:03:34.000 --> 1:03:36.000]  He didn't say don't take the vaccine.
[1:03:36.000 --> 1:03:39.000]  He didn't say Bill Gates is using it as a mind control chemical agent.
[1:03:39.000 --> 1:03:45.000]  He just talked about not being comfortable with forcing attendees to his show
[1:03:45.000 --> 1:03:52.000]  who may or may not be able to get this medicine, having them barred from his live performances.
[1:03:52.000 --> 1:03:55.000]  And now he's getting attacked, but that's a badge of honor to be attacked.
[1:03:55.000 --> 1:03:58.000]  If you're not being attacked now, you're not doing something right.
[1:03:58.000 --> 1:03:59.000]  Yeah.
[1:03:59.000 --> 1:04:01.000]  But you know what, I guess it's just because I know what a...
[1:04:01.000 --> 1:04:03.000]  And this is the first time I've met him.
[1:04:03.000 --> 1:04:06.000]  And by the way, for people who don't know, he has appeared on other episodes of the show
[1:04:06.000 --> 1:04:08.000]  and sketches kind of like yourself, too.
[1:04:08.000 --> 1:04:10.000]  It's sort of like a Dean Martin variety hour in this, in that sense.
[1:04:10.000 --> 1:04:13.000]  We'll have these celebrities appear in sketches.
[1:04:13.000 --> 1:04:17.000]  It's one of the funniest things Alex said I'd ever done having you be the angel Gabriel.
[1:04:17.000 --> 1:04:18.000]  I still laugh about it.
[1:04:18.000 --> 1:04:22.000]  But I will say this, it really does.
[1:04:22.000 --> 1:04:26.000]  And honestly, it breaks my heart because he's such a sweet man and he was...
[1:04:26.000 --> 1:04:30.000]  Anyway, you know what, the only thing I can do is encourage people to watch the full interview
[1:04:30.000 --> 1:04:31.000]  because I never want...
[1:04:31.000 --> 1:04:35.000]  Look, if someone says something, obviously there's accountability.
[1:04:35.000 --> 1:04:37.000]  When people say there's no cancel culture, there's accountability culture.
[1:04:37.000 --> 1:04:38.000]  No, no, no, no, no, no.
[1:04:38.000 --> 1:04:40.000]  There is a difference because everyone should be accountable.
[1:04:40.000 --> 1:04:41.000]  No, you're right.
[1:04:41.000 --> 1:04:42.000]  Steven Crowder, we're out of time.
[1:04:42.000 --> 1:04:43.000]  Come back again soon.
[1:04:43.000 --> 1:04:45.000]  Thank you so much.
[1:04:45.000 --> 1:04:54.000]  I am taping this update on the morning of Tuesday, October 19th, 2021 to let all of our great radio and TV listeners know

[1:05:32.000 --> 1:05:33.000]  DNA Force Plus.

[1:06:08.000 --> 1:06:12.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are now into hour number two.
[1:06:12.000 --> 1:06:18.000]  And I have got so much just amazing news and interesting information to cover.
[1:06:18.000 --> 1:06:23.000]  And I have a real frustration here on air that I'll just vent with all of you.
[1:06:23.000 --> 1:06:25.000]  I usually host three hours.
[1:06:25.000 --> 1:06:27.000]  Sometimes I host four hours of the show.
[1:06:27.000 --> 1:06:28.000]  I do things different than other people.
[1:06:28.000 --> 1:06:31.000]  I have a three-hour syndicated show, but sometimes I do a fourth hour.
[1:06:31.000 --> 1:06:35.000]  And so we have guest hosts through the fourth hour, just in case something big breaks.
[1:06:35.000 --> 1:06:39.000]  And because the people I have on that do the fourth hour are people I like,
[1:06:39.000 --> 1:06:42.000]  and I think are interesting and I think are informative.
[1:06:42.000 --> 1:06:47.000]  So I usually end up eating my lunch and taking care of research in that hour after the show.
[1:06:47.000 --> 1:06:50.000]  So I like to watch and listen to the show just like you do,
[1:06:50.000 --> 1:06:53.000]  just I don't like to watch and listen to Alex Jones.
[1:06:53.000 --> 1:06:56.000]  I mean, sometimes I think I'm interesting in things,
[1:06:56.000 --> 1:06:58.000]  but I'm not the biggest Alex Jones viewer or listener.
[1:06:58.000 --> 1:07:00.000]  I don't read interviews I'm in.
[1:07:00.000 --> 1:07:02.000]  I don't watch films I'm in.
[1:07:02.000 --> 1:07:05.000]  I don't watch documentaries I'm in, unless I absolutely have to.
[1:07:05.000 --> 1:07:09.000]  It's just something that's a little old.
[1:07:09.000 --> 1:07:12.000]  But I am very, very thankful that you tune in and that you put up with me.
[1:07:12.000 --> 1:07:17.000]  But believe me, I'm the guy that needs to be critiqued.
[1:07:17.000 --> 1:07:21.000]  I'm the guy that has this giant audience of amazing people like you
[1:07:21.000 --> 1:07:24.000]  that are awake that the globalist fear.
[1:07:24.000 --> 1:07:27.000]  So I am extremely honored to be here.
[1:07:27.000 --> 1:07:31.000]  And I'll just be completely honest with you.
[1:07:31.000 --> 1:07:38.000]  It's this weird phenomenon that after I've read something a couple of times,
[1:07:38.000 --> 1:07:44.000]  it's exciting while I'm reading it at 1 a.m. at my house or at 4 p.m. in my office
[1:07:44.000 --> 1:07:46.000]  or at 9 p.m. at night.
[1:07:46.000 --> 1:07:51.000]  But then when it's the next day and I've got all the documents in front of me,
[1:07:51.000 --> 1:07:54.000]  it's not that it's not exciting anymore.
[1:07:54.000 --> 1:07:59.000]  It's like, oh my God, it took me two hours to read that.
[1:07:59.000 --> 1:08:02.000]  How am I going to do this justice?
[1:08:02.000 --> 1:08:04.000]  And that's the frustration.
[1:08:04.000 --> 1:08:09.000]  Is there so much going on, so much happening,
[1:08:09.000 --> 1:08:12.000]  that if I just mention a few of these things here,
[1:08:12.000 --> 1:08:16.000]  I mean, hours and hours of research and don't get it exactly right,
[1:08:16.000 --> 1:08:20.000]  I'm almost doing a disservice by conditioning people to all this evil.
[1:08:20.000 --> 1:08:24.000]  Because if you don't get conscious and drill into it and really grasp it
[1:08:24.000 --> 1:08:29.000]  and really fundamentally change and commit to fight this
[1:08:29.000 --> 1:08:33.000]  and commit to become aware of it at a cellular level,
[1:08:33.000 --> 1:08:35.000]  this broadcast actually does bad.
[1:08:35.000 --> 1:08:37.000]  It actually causes harm.
[1:08:37.000 --> 1:08:40.000]  Now, overall, the broadcast causes a lot of positive things to happen.
[1:08:40.000 --> 1:08:43.000]  And the globalists were arrogant a long time ago,
[1:08:43.000 --> 1:08:45.000]  and a few times I've talked to some of them.
[1:08:45.000 --> 1:08:47.000]  They said, hey, don't worry, we think the public are scum,
[1:08:47.000 --> 1:08:49.000]  and we think when you tell them all this stuff,
[1:08:49.000 --> 1:08:53.000]  it'll just demoralize them or scare them or condition them not to fight back
[1:08:53.000 --> 1:08:55.000]  and give up.
[1:08:55.000 --> 1:08:58.000]  Well, I think we've proven that populism and nationalism
[1:08:58.000 --> 1:09:01.000]  and through God's power and through surrendering to God,
[1:09:01.000 --> 1:09:03.000]  that's a daily process,
[1:09:03.000 --> 1:09:06.000]  that we can transcend Satan and the New World Order.
[1:09:06.000 --> 1:09:09.000]  We better or we're all going to be destroyed.
[1:09:09.000 --> 1:09:12.000]  And we see that now that we're coming to the end of the line.
[1:09:12.000 --> 1:09:15.000]  So let me just try to give you an example.
[1:09:15.000 --> 1:09:17.000]  And a lot of times I do this at the start of the show.
[1:09:17.000 --> 1:09:21.000]  And I don't think in all the years I've been on air,
[1:09:21.000 --> 1:09:23.000]  I've actually ever gotten even through one or two of the stacks
[1:09:23.000 --> 1:09:25.000]  of just reading the headlines.
[1:09:25.000 --> 1:09:28.000]  But let me just give you an example of some of the stuff I've got here
[1:09:28.000 --> 1:09:30.000]  in my stack.
[1:09:30.000 --> 1:09:32.000]  Country music legend, Travis Tritt, boycotts,
[1:09:32.000 --> 1:09:34.000]  any venue or promoter, mandating masks,
[1:09:34.000 --> 1:09:37.000]  requiring vaccinations, are pushing COVID testing.
[1:09:37.000 --> 1:09:39.000]  I read this early in the morning.
[1:09:39.000 --> 1:09:41.000]  The transcript is incredible.
[1:09:41.000 --> 1:09:43.000]  I went and watched like 30 minutes of the interview,
[1:09:43.000 --> 1:09:45.000]  and I was like, this guy's incredibly well-spoken.
[1:09:45.000 --> 1:09:47.000]  I mean, I wish I was that well-spoken.
[1:09:47.000 --> 1:09:50.000]  I'm like, wow, thank God they forced people like this
[1:09:50.000 --> 1:09:54.000]  who are smart and talented off the bench.
[1:09:54.000 --> 1:09:56.000]  And I'm not saying he was being lazy,
[1:09:56.000 --> 1:09:59.000]  but off the bench into the political arena,
[1:09:59.000 --> 1:10:01.000]  and that's what should scare the globalist.
[1:10:01.000 --> 1:10:04.000]  I could read what he said and play what he said on Crowder
[1:10:04.000 --> 1:10:06.000]  for the rest of this hour,
[1:10:06.000 --> 1:10:08.000]  and that would be a really important hour of radio.
[1:10:08.000 --> 1:10:11.000]  That's one piece of gold out of hundreds.
[1:10:11.000 --> 1:10:14.000]  Here's another one right here, OK?
[1:10:14.000 --> 1:10:17.000]  Shock, FDA delays Moderna Vax for adolescent sighting concerns
[1:10:17.000 --> 1:10:20.000]  of microcarditis risk and heart attacks,
[1:10:20.000 --> 1:10:23.000]  and it's not rare, it's prominent, and it's serious.
[1:10:23.000 --> 1:10:26.000]  That's in Reuters.
[1:10:26.000 --> 1:10:28.000]  That's in the Gateway Pundit.
[1:10:28.000 --> 1:10:32.000]  That is a whole three-hour show taking calls.
[1:10:32.000 --> 1:10:35.000]  How are they going to approve something that they admit
[1:10:35.000 --> 1:10:38.000]  in the public testing where they bypass regular trials
[1:10:38.000 --> 1:10:40.000]  that's causing massive heart attacks worldwide?
[1:10:40.000 --> 1:10:43.000]  And by the way, Moderna and Pfizer are banned in over 100 countries
[1:10:43.000 --> 1:10:46.000]  as of six months ago, plus, and then continuing through,
[1:10:46.000 --> 1:10:48.000]  that there's new countries banning it every week,
[1:10:48.000 --> 1:10:51.000]  because it causes damn heart attacks.
[1:10:51.000 --> 1:10:53.000]  And what did all the top scientists say?
[1:10:53.000 --> 1:10:56.000]  I mean, literally, we quoted dozens of them last year saying
[1:10:56.000 --> 1:10:58.000]  it's going to cause microcarditis.
[1:10:58.000 --> 1:11:00.000]  Oh, but don't listen to Wolfgang Wudar.
[1:11:00.000 --> 1:11:01.000]  Don't listen to Dr. Yedon.
[1:11:01.000 --> 1:11:04.000]  Don't listen to all of them.
[1:11:04.000 --> 1:11:08.000]  How about the CDC in October with their secret report
[1:11:08.000 --> 1:11:10.000]  that got leaked that they later put on their website
[1:11:10.000 --> 1:11:13.000]  and admitted that list of adverse reactions
[1:11:13.000 --> 1:11:17.000]  they were predicting was microcarditis and a bunch of other stuff,
[1:11:17.000 --> 1:11:20.000]  including one disorder where your platelets all disappear
[1:11:20.000 --> 1:11:22.000]  and you bleed to death.
[1:11:22.000 --> 1:11:28.000]  And, you know, I've got some family that I've been close to in the past,
[1:11:28.000 --> 1:11:31.000]  but they're liberals and they don't really talk to me anymore.
[1:11:31.000 --> 1:11:34.000]  And I remember thinking, man, I wonder if they're all going to take the double jab.
[1:11:34.000 --> 1:11:36.000]  How long they'll be alive?
[1:11:36.000 --> 1:11:39.000]  Sure enough, one of them got double jab, dying right now
[1:11:39.000 --> 1:11:42.000]  of liquefying the platelets.
[1:11:42.000 --> 1:11:44.000]  And it's right there.
[1:11:44.000 --> 1:11:46.000]  I played a clip of Dr. Merritt talking about it last hour.
[1:11:46.000 --> 1:11:53.000]  I mean, this is serious business.
[1:11:53.000 --> 1:11:56.000]  Serious business takes the shots a few months later,
[1:11:56.000 --> 1:12:00.000]  going to hospice to die.
[1:12:00.000 --> 1:12:02.000]  Very, very sad and pray for them.
[1:12:02.000 --> 1:12:05.000]  So people just can't believe this is happening.
[1:12:05.000 --> 1:12:09.000]  So they double down and oh, oh, oh, the two Pfizer shots don't worry.
[1:12:09.000 --> 1:12:11.000]  The two Moderna shots don't worry.
[1:12:11.000 --> 1:12:13.000]  They take another one.
[1:12:13.000 --> 1:12:15.000]  Here's another article.
[1:12:15.000 --> 1:12:17.000]  I just covered two.
[1:12:17.000 --> 1:12:20.000]  French clergy sexually abused over 200,000 children
[1:12:20.000 --> 1:12:22.000]  and the government covered it up.
[1:12:22.000 --> 1:12:24.000]  Reuters.
[1:12:24.000 --> 1:12:25.000]  It's a lot worse than that.
[1:12:25.000 --> 1:12:26.000]  Oh, and then this article on the New York Post,
[1:12:26.000 --> 1:12:28.000]  see how they tie together?
[1:12:28.000 --> 1:12:36.000]  Biden's secretly flying underage migrants into New York in dead of night.
[1:12:36.000 --> 1:12:40.000]  And there's all these videos and photos of kids that look as young as seven years old
[1:12:40.000 --> 1:12:43.000]  and it said, oh, just any charity wants them, gets them.
[1:12:43.000 --> 1:12:45.000]  And then I flashed back to four or five months ago.
[1:12:45.000 --> 1:12:52.000]  We're down in McAllen and they're giving children as young as five years old
[1:12:52.000 --> 1:12:55.000]  to men in vans without their mothers.
[1:12:55.000 --> 1:12:57.000]  And a guy walks over and goes, why are you guys against this?
[1:12:57.000 --> 1:12:58.000]  We've got cameras on.
[1:12:58.000 --> 1:13:00.000]  He goes, I'm here to take him to Pennsylvania.
[1:13:00.000 --> 1:13:02.000]  Show him the way of the Lord.
[1:13:02.000 --> 1:13:05.000]  He's going, the Lord, what's wrong with these kids?
[1:13:05.000 --> 1:13:07.000]  Nobody wants these kids, these women.
[1:13:07.000 --> 1:13:09.000]  I'm going to show these women the way of the Lord.
[1:13:09.000 --> 1:13:12.000]  I'm going to take women with me that don't have no children,
[1:13:12.000 --> 1:13:14.000]  that don't have no husband.
[1:13:14.000 --> 1:13:18.000]  We had an undercover cop win in and a woman was telling us what was happening.
[1:13:18.000 --> 1:13:22.000]  She comes out, he follows her out and says, what are you doing?
[1:13:22.000 --> 1:13:27.000]  Then women and children need me to teach them the way of the Lord.
[1:13:27.000 --> 1:13:28.000]  They load them in vans.
[1:13:28.000 --> 1:13:30.000]  I mean, folks, this is not a movie.
[1:13:30.000 --> 1:13:32.000]  This is not Netflix.
[1:13:32.000 --> 1:13:37.000]  This is the real world, unaccompanied children.
[1:13:37.000 --> 1:13:42.000]  And then they just load them into vans with the creepiest looking dudes I've ever seen.
[1:13:42.000 --> 1:13:46.000]  And we had the undercover cop inside off and on for a day.
[1:13:46.000 --> 1:13:49.000]  She would go into the charity and talk to them in Spanish.
[1:13:49.000 --> 1:13:51.000]  And she's older and stuff.
[1:13:51.000 --> 1:13:54.000]  So it didn't quite look like a cop or whatever.
[1:13:54.000 --> 1:13:57.000]  She's got her badge and all that stuff under her purse.
[1:13:57.000 --> 1:14:00.000]  And she goes in there and she's sitting there talking to them.
[1:14:00.000 --> 1:14:02.000]  She goes, yeah, they're talking about how I want this woman.
[1:14:02.000 --> 1:14:03.000]  I want that woman.
[1:14:03.000 --> 1:14:04.000]  I want those kids.
[1:14:04.000 --> 1:14:05.000]  I don't want them with any men or boys.
[1:14:05.000 --> 1:14:07.000]  I'm going to teach them.
[1:14:07.000 --> 1:14:08.000]  I'm going to put them to work.
[1:14:08.000 --> 1:14:09.000]  I'm going to learn them.
[1:14:09.000 --> 1:14:11.000]  And I'm not trying to talk like a hillbilly, but they got weird hillbillies in Pennsylvania.
[1:14:11.000 --> 1:14:13.000]  This guy's like, you saw the video.
[1:14:13.000 --> 1:14:15.000]  He's like, he walks that morning.
[1:14:15.000 --> 1:14:17.000]  He looks at something down.
[1:14:17.000 --> 1:14:18.000]  What's wrong?
[1:14:18.000 --> 1:14:20.000]  I'm trying to get women for me.
[1:14:20.000 --> 1:14:23.000]  I'm taking them to Pennsylvania for me to work from the Lord.
[1:14:23.000 --> 1:14:25.000]  And then we confirm.
[1:14:25.000 --> 1:14:26.000]  No paperwork, no nothing.
[1:14:26.000 --> 1:14:28.000]  He's inside going, I paid good monies.
[1:14:28.000 --> 1:14:29.000]  You said, bring down here.
[1:14:29.000 --> 1:14:30.000]  I'll get women.
[1:14:30.000 --> 1:14:32.000]  I'm here with women.
[1:14:32.000 --> 1:14:34.000]  I'm here with the Lord.
[1:14:34.000 --> 1:14:37.000]  I mean, you know, I mean, just, okay, that's just one more article.
[1:14:37.000 --> 1:14:40.000]  I mean, everyone of them just is horrible.
[1:14:40.000 --> 1:14:46.000]  Oh, you think they just got 200,000 slave kids in France or 30,000 per major city in
[1:14:46.000 --> 1:14:47.000]  Germany?
[1:14:47.000 --> 1:14:50.000]  Folks, their religion is raping and then murdering children.
[1:14:50.000 --> 1:14:53.000]  I'm not saying that guy come out of the place as a pedophile or he does that.
[1:14:53.000 --> 1:14:54.000]  I'm sure he's a wonderful guy.
[1:14:54.000 --> 1:14:59.000]  Just if I was casting someone in a movie, you know, like a Rob Zombie new movie, House
[1:14:59.000 --> 1:15:01.000]  with Thousand Corpse or something.
[1:15:01.000 --> 1:15:04.000]  I mean, you know, the people they cast are not scary at all.
[1:15:04.000 --> 1:15:06.000]  I'd go down to where the people get these kids.
[1:15:06.000 --> 1:15:10.000]  I don't know why, but every one of them is the most scary damn looking person I've ever
[1:15:10.000 --> 1:15:11.000]  seen.
[1:15:11.000 --> 1:15:12.000]  They all look scarier than Brian Stelter.
[1:15:12.000 --> 1:15:14.000]  They look scarier than Governor Newsom.
[1:15:14.000 --> 1:15:17.000]  I mean, my God, if I was walking down the street, I'd say that's a child molester, probably
[1:15:17.000 --> 1:15:18.000]  a killer.
[1:15:18.000 --> 1:15:19.000]  You know, you'll be pumping and gasping.
[1:15:19.000 --> 1:15:21.000]  You see, black, white doesn't matter.
[1:15:21.000 --> 1:15:22.000]  You go, that person's a hardened criminal.
[1:15:22.000 --> 1:15:24.000]  They're not trying to act like they're a criminal.
[1:15:24.000 --> 1:15:25.000]  You just get the aura.
[1:15:25.000 --> 1:15:29.000]  That's a person that'll hog tally you while they rape your wife and then blow your head
[1:15:29.000 --> 1:15:30.000]  off.
[1:15:30.000 --> 1:15:31.000]  I'm here with women.
[1:15:31.000 --> 1:15:32.000]  No men with them.
[1:15:32.000 --> 1:15:33.000]  Show them the Lord.
[1:15:33.000 --> 1:15:36.000]  Why are you here to stop me?
[1:15:36.000 --> 1:15:37.000]  Who are you?
[1:15:37.000 --> 1:15:39.000]  I just, nobody wants these women anyways.
[1:15:39.000 --> 1:15:46.000]  Nobody want to make them work.
[1:15:46.000 --> 1:15:48.000]  Your voice counts.
[1:15:48.000 --> 1:15:53.000]  When you share information, be it over the internet or in person, it changes the world.
[1:15:53.000 --> 1:15:56.000]  The globalists know their agenda is unpopular.
[1:15:56.000 --> 1:15:57.000]  They know you're angry.
[1:15:57.000 --> 1:16:02.000]  And now to get around big tech, it's more important than ever that we use every tool
[1:16:02.000 --> 1:16:03.000]  we've got.

[1:18:12.000 --> 1:18:15.000]  So sure, you didn't start a fight with Bill Gates.
[1:18:15.000 --> 1:18:18.000]  You didn't start a fight with David Rockefeller.
[1:18:18.000 --> 1:18:20.000]  You didn't start a fight with the UN.
[1:18:20.000 --> 1:18:23.000]  They started a fight with you.
[1:18:23.000 --> 1:18:27.000]  And they're not going to back down and they're not going to go away and they're not going
[1:18:27.000 --> 1:18:32.000]  to ever stop their attacks until they have the fear of God put into them.
[1:18:32.000 --> 1:18:36.000]  But the average person still doesn't even know about the New World Order or about globalism
[1:18:36.000 --> 1:18:38.000]  or about corporate fascism.
[1:18:38.000 --> 1:18:43.000]  It's not until people understand that and that we're under attack that we have any chance
[1:18:43.000 --> 1:18:47.000]  of beating these people.
[1:18:47.000 --> 1:18:57.000]  If you only knew the power of the dark side, join Bill Gates and together we will defeat
[1:18:57.000 --> 1:18:59.000]  humanity.
[1:18:59.000 --> 1:19:05.000]  Then our God will reward us with eternal life.
[1:19:05.000 --> 1:19:09.000]  That's basically the ethos of the globalists.
[1:19:09.000 --> 1:19:11.000]  They must first play God.
[1:19:11.000 --> 1:19:17.000]  They must first prove that they are the fittest in their social Darwinistic system.
[1:19:17.000 --> 1:19:19.000]  And in a way they're right.
[1:19:19.000 --> 1:19:25.000]  If we let them lie to us and dumb us down and poison us and destroy our children's futures,
[1:19:25.000 --> 1:19:27.000]  the evidence is overwhelming and out in the open.
[1:19:27.000 --> 1:19:30.000]  We really deserve what's happened to us.
[1:19:30.000 --> 1:19:36.000]  So I ask you now, are you going to step up and expose the New World Order even more?
[1:19:36.000 --> 1:19:40.000]  I know I'm pledging to step up and redouble my efforts.
[1:19:40.000 --> 1:20:09.000]  The front lines of the fight is infowars.com.
[1:20:09.000 --> 1:20:13.000]  Clashing the lines and disinformation.
[1:20:13.000 --> 1:20:19.000]  Waging war on corruption.
[1:20:19.000 --> 1:20:21.000]  I'm looking down on you.
[1:20:21.000 --> 1:20:23.000]  On laser's trace.
[1:20:23.000 --> 1:20:25.000]  Everything you do.
[1:20:25.000 --> 1:20:35.000]  You think you got private lives.
[1:20:35.000 --> 1:20:38.000]  I'm elemental.
[1:20:38.000 --> 1:20:41.000]  My sight is clean.
[1:20:41.000 --> 1:20:45.000]  I am perpetual.
[1:20:45.000 --> 1:20:48.000]  Let's get into it right now.
[1:20:48.000 --> 1:20:52.000]  I've talked about the freak show that is the New World Order.
[1:20:52.000 --> 1:21:00.000]  And how they're not just going to do things that are ridiculous and go according to madness and go against common sense.
[1:21:00.000 --> 1:21:08.000]  But they're going to do things like promoting people that don't have the curricula vitae, who don't have the background,
[1:21:08.000 --> 1:21:13.000]  and who will also then do whatever they're told, like Pete Buttigieg.
[1:21:13.000 --> 1:21:15.000]  He can be gone three months.
[1:21:15.000 --> 1:21:20.000]  He can get caught staging photo ops where he says he's riding a bike, but he was really driving in an SUV.
[1:21:20.000 --> 1:21:26.000]  He can call for banning cars or green taxes and, you know, all the rest is crap.
[1:21:26.000 --> 1:21:28.000]  But it's okay because he's gay.
[1:21:28.000 --> 1:21:30.000]  Goodness, okay.
[1:21:30.000 --> 1:21:36.000]  And he can even pose in beds at the hospital saying we just had a baby.
[1:21:36.000 --> 1:21:40.000]  And then he can, you know, pose in pools, wearing a dress or whatever.
[1:21:40.000 --> 1:21:43.000]  It's all supposed to be, oh, well, look, it doesn't matter if he's selling us out.
[1:21:43.000 --> 1:21:45.000]  I mean, he's gay.
[1:21:45.000 --> 1:21:47.000]  Tim Cook runs the worst death camps in the world.
[1:21:47.000 --> 1:21:48.000]  I mean, he's gay, though.
[1:21:48.000 --> 1:21:50.000]  I mean, my God, it's got to be okay.
[1:21:50.000 --> 1:21:53.000]  Again, black turtledex sweater, you know, bug eyes, all of it.
[1:21:53.000 --> 1:21:54.000]  It's great.
[1:21:54.000 --> 1:21:55.000]  Well, don't worry, though.
[1:21:55.000 --> 1:22:01.000]  Stop that, drag queen story time, convicted pedophiles, women bringing their children up the altar to put them on their lap
[1:22:01.000 --> 1:22:03.000]  and then to roll on them and hump each other.
[1:22:03.000 --> 1:22:09.000]  I mean, we got those videos, mainline schools across the country, elementary schools, libraries.
[1:22:09.000 --> 1:22:15.000]  Now the drag queen lays there in their clown outfit, their demonic clown outfit.
[1:22:15.000 --> 1:22:17.000]  It's always a beast's scary looking dude.
[1:22:17.000 --> 1:22:25.000]  And then the women put their children on their waist and the children wallow in a simulated demonic event.
[1:22:25.000 --> 1:22:30.000]  And they've got, like, subliminals and blue clues of, like, human sacrifice to mullet your children.
[1:22:30.000 --> 1:22:32.000]  I mean, this is some heavy-duty stuff.
[1:22:32.000 --> 1:22:38.000]  So we're already talking about this last hour, where this comes from, what this is.
[1:22:38.000 --> 1:22:40.000]  But here it is.
[1:22:40.000 --> 1:22:43.000]  Imagine if a man, I'm a man, I want to assist your children.
[1:22:43.000 --> 1:22:44.000]  Oh, no, that's creepy.
[1:22:44.000 --> 1:22:45.000]  That's bad.
[1:22:45.000 --> 1:22:46.000]  Call the police.
[1:22:46.000 --> 1:22:50.000]  I'm dressed up like a woman, like Norman Bates in Psycho.
[1:22:50.000 --> 1:22:53.000]  So drum roll please, this is the Washington Post.
[1:22:53.000 --> 1:22:54.000]  This is not a joke.
[1:22:54.000 --> 1:22:56.000]  This is not a game.
[1:22:56.000 --> 1:22:57.000]  This is not the onion.
[1:22:57.000 --> 1:22:59.000]  This is not the Babylon bead.
[1:22:59.000 --> 1:23:02.000]  This is real.
[1:23:02.000 --> 1:23:11.000]  Rachel Levine, openly transgender health official, to be sworn in as four-star admiral.
[1:23:11.000 --> 1:23:14.000]  It's like an escape from New York, where they go down to the basement of the building
[1:23:14.000 --> 1:23:16.000]  and he finds a bum that has the president's tracker.
[1:23:16.000 --> 1:23:18.000]  He goes, Mr. President, Mr. President.
[1:23:18.000 --> 1:23:21.000]  He looks and goes, yeah, I'm the president.
[1:23:21.000 --> 1:23:23.000]  I'm the president.
[1:23:23.000 --> 1:23:25.000]  I'm a four-star admiral.
[1:23:25.000 --> 1:23:33.000]  How about, how about he's a, oh, she's a naval aviator.
[1:23:33.000 --> 1:23:35.000]  She lands on aircraft carriers.
[1:23:35.000 --> 1:23:38.000]  How about she was the first woman to walk on the moon?
[1:23:38.000 --> 1:23:40.000]  No, it's not true, but let's just say it.
[1:23:40.000 --> 1:23:43.000]  Hell, let's give her Woman of the Year award.
[1:23:43.000 --> 1:23:44.000]  Like Caitlyn Jenner was.
[1:23:44.000 --> 1:23:46.000]  Or let's give a Nobel Prize to Obama.
[1:23:46.000 --> 1:23:50.000]  Or let's give one to Henry Kissinger that launched war crimes everywhere and bragged about it.
[1:23:50.000 --> 1:23:54.000]  Hell, let's give Hitler a Southern Property Law Center ADL award.
[1:23:54.000 --> 1:24:02.000]  So, Rachel Levine, openly transgender health official, to be sworn in as four-star admiral.
[1:24:02.000 --> 1:24:08.000]  Darth Vader literally strangled the last one and said, you are in command now, admiral.
[1:24:08.000 --> 1:24:10.000]  There it is, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:24:10.000 --> 1:24:13.000]  Can you guys find the psycho clip with audio?
[1:24:13.000 --> 1:24:16.000]  I'm going to play some of that here in a moment.
[1:24:16.000 --> 1:24:17.000]  Or you know what, I haven't played it yet.
[1:24:17.000 --> 1:24:19.000]  I mentioned it to Stephen Crowder.
[1:24:19.000 --> 1:24:23.000]  Please cue up the new little meme.
[1:24:23.000 --> 1:24:25.000]  Oh, before they fact-check me at Reuters and say,
[1:24:25.000 --> 1:24:31.000]  Jones played a fake video of Fauci as the transgender psychopath in Silence of the Lambs
[1:24:31.000 --> 1:24:34.000]  with the woman down in the pit saying she rubs the lotion on the skin.
[1:24:34.000 --> 1:24:36.000]  This is called a parody.
[1:24:36.000 --> 1:24:37.000]  It's called a meme.
[1:24:37.000 --> 1:24:39.000]  It's called a joke, which they know.
[1:24:39.000 --> 1:24:42.000]  But they fact-check even the memes we play and say,
[1:24:42.000 --> 1:24:45.000]  Jones tried to get a fake video over on Fauci.
[1:24:45.000 --> 1:24:46.000]  No, that's fake.
[1:24:46.000 --> 1:24:47.000]  That's a joke.
[1:24:47.000 --> 1:24:49.000]  This isn't fake right here.
[1:24:49.000 --> 1:24:52.000]  A man saying they're a woman now is an admiral.
[1:24:52.000 --> 1:24:55.000]  I mean, it is a fake man, a fake woman.
[1:24:55.000 --> 1:24:56.000]  Of course, it's totally fake.
[1:24:56.000 --> 1:24:57.000]  Not really an admiral.
[1:24:57.000 --> 1:25:01.000]  It's just governments, as they begin to collapse, like any third world, but in a republic,
[1:25:01.000 --> 1:25:06.000]  start festooning, you know, four or five, six stars on everybody they can.
[1:25:06.000 --> 1:25:08.000]  It's like a dictator in Latin America or something.
[1:25:08.000 --> 1:25:13.000]  So, a senior, oh, senior, oh, my God.
[1:25:13.000 --> 1:25:19.000]  Mellford Pointy, who made history when she became the nation's highest ranking
[1:25:19.000 --> 1:25:27.000]  openly transgender official, is also supposed to become its first openly transgender four-star officer.
[1:25:27.000 --> 1:25:31.000]  The administration announced on Tuesday, Rachel Levine,
[1:25:31.000 --> 1:25:41.000]  oh, U.S. Secretary for Health will be sworn in Tuesday as an admiral of the U.S. Public Health Service Commission Corps.
[1:25:41.000 --> 1:25:44.000]  For outreach to your children, I should add.
[1:25:44.000 --> 1:25:52.000]  A 6,000 person force that responds to health on behalf of the federal government
[1:25:52.000 --> 1:25:57.000]  including administering coronavirus vaccines and delivering care after hurricanes.
[1:25:57.000 --> 1:26:03.000]  Levine is also this generation's first ever female four-star admiral.
[1:26:03.000 --> 1:26:07.000]  It's the first female four-star admiral.
[1:26:07.000 --> 1:26:11.000]  I thought General Milley was the first female four-star admiral.
[1:26:11.000 --> 1:26:14.000]  Yes, I know General Milley wasn't an admiral.
[1:26:14.000 --> 1:26:15.000]  I know he was in the Army.
[1:26:15.000 --> 1:26:17.000]  It doesn't matter anymore, does it?
[1:26:17.000 --> 1:26:19.000]  What you know is he's a sack of garbage.
[1:26:19.000 --> 1:26:21.000]  Look at this.
[1:26:21.000 --> 1:26:22.000]  Look at this.
[1:26:22.000 --> 1:26:24.000]  We're not supposed to laugh at this.
[1:26:24.000 --> 1:26:30.000]  I made the joke that, hey, how about just give him the Woman of the Year Award like they gave Jenner?
[1:26:30.000 --> 1:26:33.000]  The male Olympic athlete.
[1:26:33.000 --> 1:26:34.000]  But they already did.
[1:26:34.000 --> 1:26:38.000]  Look, look, women, don't you feel like you've attained something?
[1:26:38.000 --> 1:26:43.000]  You are now a four-star general.
[1:26:43.000 --> 1:26:49.000]  Finally, in the 240-year history of the United States, 243 years.
[1:26:49.000 --> 1:26:57.000]  We never had a four-star admiral woman.
[1:26:57.000 --> 1:26:58.000]  Absolute.
[1:26:58.000 --> 1:27:05.000]  Dun-dun-dun, dun-dun-dun, dun-dun-dun.
[1:27:05.000 --> 1:27:09.000]  But they're teaching this to children and it's causing total mental illness.
[1:27:09.000 --> 1:27:11.000]  So here is the parody of Fauci.
[1:27:11.000 --> 1:27:13.000]  It rubs the lotion on its skin.
[1:27:13.000 --> 1:27:15.000]  It takes the vaccine into its, oh, creepy.
[1:27:15.000 --> 1:27:16.000]  Look at those teeth.
[1:27:16.000 --> 1:27:18.000]  That's the general material there.
[1:27:18.000 --> 1:27:28.000]  Man, I mean, look, if you were casting somebody for a serial killer that each children are like a demonic alien from space that hatches out of an egg and starts eating children, I mean, central casting, here we come.
[1:27:28.000 --> 1:27:30.000]  Here it is, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:27:30.000 --> 1:27:32.000]  It puts the needle in its skin.
[1:27:32.000 --> 1:27:35.000]  It puts it in whenever it's told.
[1:27:35.000 --> 1:27:37.000]  I'm a pureblood.
[1:27:37.000 --> 1:27:39.000]  I don't want the jab.
[1:27:39.000 --> 1:27:43.000]  I won't take the vax.
[1:27:43.000 --> 1:27:52.000]  It puts the needle in its skin or else it gets the pink slip.
[1:27:52.000 --> 1:27:55.000]  It puts the needle in its skin.
[1:27:55.000 --> 1:27:57.000]  You can't make me take it.
[1:27:57.000 --> 1:27:58.000]  Please.
[1:27:58.000 --> 1:28:00.000]  Please, don't.
[1:28:00.000 --> 1:28:04.000]  It puts the needle in its skin.
[1:28:04.000 --> 1:28:19.000]  It puts the needle in its skin.
[1:28:19.000 --> 1:28:22.000]  You know Fauci stands in front of the mirror and says, I like me.
[1:28:22.000 --> 1:28:23.000]  I like me.
[1:28:23.000 --> 1:28:27.000]  Oh, yeah.
[1:28:27.000 --> 1:28:30.000]  Okay, that's just one more story.
[1:28:30.000 --> 1:28:33.000]  I literally got hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds.
[1:28:33.000 --> 1:28:39.000]  And when we come back, oh, Fauci's got something special for you.
[1:28:39.000 --> 1:29:05.000]  A virus that kills 80% of people he made on record and he's getting ready to release it on you.
[1:29:05.000 --> 1:29:10.000]  You can't make me take it.
[1:29:10.000 --> 1:29:39.000]  You can't make me take it.
[1:29:39.000 --> 1:29:46.000]  Damn it.
[1:29:46.000 --> 1:29:48.560]  Down and out liquid sleep support.
[1:29:48.560 --> 1:29:49.960]  It's been out of stock for a while.
[1:29:49.960 --> 1:29:51.600]  It's one of three sleep aids.
[1:29:51.600 --> 1:29:53.720]  We have it infowarstore.com.
[1:29:53.720 --> 1:29:54.960]  This one has been very popular.
[1:29:54.960 --> 1:29:56.040]  It sold off the shelves.
[1:29:56.040 --> 1:29:57.080]  It's back in stock.
[1:29:57.080 --> 1:29:59.920]  Down and out liquid sleep support.
[1:29:59.920 --> 1:30:04.920]  This is probably the strongest sleep aid that we have,
[1:30:04.920 --> 1:30:05.760]  I would say.
[1:30:05.760 --> 1:30:08.680]  Knockout, rocket rest, both great.
[1:30:08.680 --> 1:30:10.080]  Comes in pill form.
[1:30:10.080 --> 1:30:11.440]  This is the liquid tincture.
[1:30:11.440 --> 1:30:14.120]  And I think this is probably the most powerful one.
[1:30:14.120 --> 1:30:16.120]  Survival Shield X2, nascent iodine.
[1:30:16.120 --> 1:30:19.200]  This is, if you haven't done an iodine challenge yet,
[1:30:19.200 --> 1:30:21.160]  have you haven't done the iodine challenge?
[1:30:21.160 --> 1:30:22.960]  What are you waiting for now is the time.
[1:30:22.960 --> 1:30:25.600]  Super male and super female vitality.
[1:30:25.600 --> 1:30:29.720]  Living Defense Plus and the organic greens fiber caps.
[1:30:29.720 --> 1:30:32.000]  We have a limited supply of these right now,
[1:30:32.000 --> 1:30:33.720]  but we want to sell them all out
[1:30:33.720 --> 1:30:34.680]  so we can order a new batch.
[1:30:34.680 --> 1:30:35.680]  It was very popular.
[1:30:35.680 --> 1:30:37.440]  The organic greens fiber caps.
[1:30:37.440 --> 1:30:39.320]  But we have all kinds of other great supplements
[1:30:39.320 --> 1:30:42.080]  that are great for so many different things.
[1:30:42.080 --> 1:30:44.560]  Take advantage of those.
[1:30:44.560 --> 1:30:46.640]  Frank in North Carolina, thanks for holding so long.
[1:30:46.640 --> 1:30:47.480]  Go ahead.
[1:30:47.480 --> 1:30:49.560]  Yeah, I just have to face up a man.
[1:30:49.560 --> 1:30:52.000]  It seems like every time I turn on your broadcast,
[1:30:52.000 --> 1:30:53.320]  you're bragging.
[1:30:53.320 --> 1:30:54.800]  It just gets old, man.
[1:30:54.800 --> 1:30:57.200]  I'm going to shut you down right now, okay?
[1:30:57.200 --> 1:30:59.520]  We're taking calls about your nomination.
[1:30:59.520 --> 1:31:02.440]  Do you understand they're having congressional hearings
[1:31:02.440 --> 1:31:04.080]  trying to shut us down?
[1:31:04.080 --> 1:31:06.680]  Do you understand I'm ringing the alarm?
[1:31:06.680 --> 1:31:09.520]  If that was happening to anybody else, I'd be freaked out.
[1:31:09.520 --> 1:31:11.960]  I mean, what's it going to take us being shut down?
[1:31:11.960 --> 1:31:13.520]  Is that what you want, Frank?
[1:31:13.520 --> 1:31:14.840]  Yeah, you know what, Alex?
[1:31:14.840 --> 1:31:15.880]  I'll put him on pause again.
[1:31:15.880 --> 1:31:18.560]  Hey, Frank, do you understand it's not bragging
[1:31:18.560 --> 1:31:20.400]  to say we are the tip of the spear,
[1:31:20.400 --> 1:31:22.320]  we're under attack, we need your help.
[1:31:22.320 --> 1:31:24.040]  As much begging as I do,
[1:31:24.040 --> 1:31:26.840]  we can barely pay the bills and grow in the face of this.
[1:31:26.840 --> 1:31:28.320]  I'm not going to just stop growth
[1:31:28.320 --> 1:31:30.040]  and let them start pushing us backwards.
[1:31:30.040 --> 1:31:30.880]  You understand?
[1:31:30.880 --> 1:31:32.080]  I need your help, Frank.
[1:31:32.080 --> 1:31:34.280]  I need your help, Frank.
[1:31:34.280 --> 1:31:37.160]  Go to infowarstore.com right now
[1:31:37.160 --> 1:31:39.920]  and help fund the Info World.
[1:31:39.920 --> 1:31:42.240]  Do you understand I need your help, Frank?
[1:31:42.240 --> 1:31:44.360]  Free press needs your help, Frank.
[1:31:44.360 --> 1:31:48.400]  I'm taking this message on the morning of Tuesday,
[1:31:48.400 --> 1:31:50.200]  October 19th, 2021,
[1:31:50.200 --> 1:31:53.840]  and I've got some great news to report to the listeners.
[1:31:53.840 --> 1:31:55.000]  For at least one week,
[1:31:55.000 --> 1:31:56.560]  we're going to be able to run a sale
[1:31:56.560 --> 1:31:58.960]  with Bobby's ultimate turmeric formula
[1:31:58.960 --> 1:32:00.800]  that just got back in stock
[1:32:00.800 --> 1:32:03.040]  after being sold out almost five months
[1:32:03.040 --> 1:32:04.920]  because of supply chain breakdowns.
[1:32:04.920 --> 1:32:08.840]  It has a 95% curcuminoid level.
[1:32:08.840 --> 1:32:10.480]  Most of the turmeric supplements
[1:32:10.480 --> 1:32:13.120]  have a 5% to 10% curcuminoid level.
[1:32:13.120 --> 1:32:16.560]  Our leading competitor has a 75% curcuminoid level.
[1:32:16.560 --> 1:32:19.560]  This is a special proprietary concentrate.
[1:32:19.560 --> 1:32:21.080]  It is so good for information,
[1:32:21.080 --> 1:32:22.720]  for your immune system,
[1:32:22.720 --> 1:32:24.880]  as an antioxidant for your whole body.
[1:32:24.880 --> 1:32:27.640]  It's documented, it's amazing.
[1:32:27.640 --> 1:32:28.960]  Everybody knows that turmeric
[1:32:28.960 --> 1:32:30.880]  is an incredible thing that God created
[1:32:30.880 --> 1:32:33.040]  and bodies is the strongest and best.
[1:32:33.040 --> 1:32:35.320]  You're going to find and it's back in stock
[1:32:35.320 --> 1:32:37.000]  and it funds the Info War.
[1:32:37.000 --> 1:32:40.080]  40% off for a limited time, that goes back to regular price.
[1:32:40.080 --> 1:32:42.120]  Right now, then FullWarsHore.com
[1:32:42.120 --> 1:32:43.720]  running the special for one week.
[1:32:47.720 --> 1:32:50.800]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:32:58.200 --> 1:33:01.000]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies
[1:33:01.000 --> 1:33:04.520]  of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[1:33:04.520 --> 1:33:06.520]  David.
[1:33:11.520 --> 1:33:13.520]  Oh, baby, I'm gonna teach you
[1:33:13.520 --> 1:33:16.520]  what love's all about tonight.
[1:33:16.520 --> 1:33:18.520]  Trust me, honey.
[1:33:20.520 --> 1:33:24.520]  Trust me, honey, everything's gonna be all right.
[1:33:24.520 --> 1:33:26.520]  Wow, they say you get majoring universities here
[1:33:26.520 --> 1:33:30.520]  and all over the western world and on TV ads in the UK.
[1:33:30.520 --> 1:33:35.520]  That if you invite a girl out or ask her to go have a cup of coffee
[1:33:35.520 --> 1:33:38.520]  or tell her she's pretty, that's a micro rate.
[1:33:40.520 --> 1:33:43.520]  But if convicted pedophiles want to come visit your children,
[1:33:43.520 --> 1:33:46.520]  in many cases, unannounced at elementary school,
[1:33:46.520 --> 1:33:48.520]  that's a good thing, yeah.
[1:33:52.520 --> 1:33:54.520]  It's out of control, ladies and gentlemen, yeah.
[1:33:54.520 --> 1:33:58.520]  It's not full grown men with full grown women saying relax, baby.
[1:33:58.520 --> 1:34:00.520]  Take it real slow.
[1:34:00.520 --> 1:34:02.520]  It's them doing that with your children
[1:34:02.520 --> 1:34:04.520]  and they're not saying they're gonna take it real slow.
[1:34:04.520 --> 1:34:06.520]  It's about destroying their innocence.
[1:34:07.520 --> 1:34:08.520]  All right, let me do this.
[1:34:08.520 --> 1:34:11.520]  I've covered a six or seven news articles.
[1:34:11.520 --> 1:34:13.520]  I've got hundreds of absolutely
[1:34:13.520 --> 1:34:15.520]  over-the-top incredible information here for you,
[1:34:15.520 --> 1:34:19.520]  and I'm just thinking how entertaining it would be
[1:34:19.520 --> 1:34:20.520]  to make fun of Lori Lightfoot,
[1:34:20.520 --> 1:34:23.520]  but would that actually save the country or the world?
[1:34:23.520 --> 1:34:26.520]  Or it's be entertaining to watch CNN and MSNBC
[1:34:26.520 --> 1:34:28.520]  and Media Matters attack Tucker Carlson
[1:34:28.520 --> 1:34:30.520]  for supporting Info Wars.
[1:34:30.520 --> 1:34:32.520]  Should we, well, that's kind of fun and interesting,
[1:34:32.520 --> 1:34:35.520]  but yeah, let's not get into Alice Jones.
[1:34:35.520 --> 1:34:38.520]  No, I think we should play sixth graders,
[1:34:38.520 --> 1:34:40.520]  secretly records teacher,
[1:34:40.520 --> 1:34:42.520]  peddling critical race theory to class.
[1:34:42.520 --> 1:34:44.520]  We're gonna get to that next segment.
[1:34:44.520 --> 1:34:47.520]  And I think we should cover this right now.
[1:34:48.520 --> 1:34:50.520]  And again, some of us are gonna say,
[1:34:50.520 --> 1:34:53.520]  hey, we're sick of hearing about the COVID.
[1:34:53.520 --> 1:34:57.520]  The COVID takeover is the world ID,
[1:34:57.520 --> 1:34:59.520]  the forced inoculations, the mass death,
[1:34:59.520 --> 1:35:01.520]  the collapse of civilization,
[1:35:01.520 --> 1:35:03.520]  the brainwashing of our children.
[1:35:03.520 --> 1:35:05.520]  It is the shutdown of the economy
[1:35:05.520 --> 1:35:07.520]  for the post-industrial world, great reset.
[1:35:07.520 --> 1:35:08.520]  They now admit that, okay?
[1:35:08.520 --> 1:35:10.520]  I mean, it's like, again,
[1:35:10.520 --> 1:35:14.520]  if Martians showed up with giant spaceships
[1:35:14.520 --> 1:35:16.520]  and cut into our TV feeds and said,
[1:35:16.520 --> 1:35:18.520]  we're gonna blow the planet up in one hour.
[1:35:20.520 --> 1:35:21.520]  And people said, hey,
[1:35:21.520 --> 1:35:24.520]  you didn't pay your month's insurance.
[1:35:24.520 --> 1:35:26.520]  I'm like, the Martians are gonna blow us up in one hour.
[1:35:26.520 --> 1:35:27.520]  We better fight back.
[1:35:27.520 --> 1:35:29.520]  I mean, it's everything.
[1:35:29.520 --> 1:35:31.520]  So I can sit here and go, oh, look,
[1:35:31.520 --> 1:35:35.520]  here's the new first woman to be a four-star admiral.
[1:35:35.520 --> 1:35:37.520]  Do you know who she is?
[1:35:37.520 --> 1:35:38.520]  It's not actually a biological woman
[1:35:38.520 --> 1:35:40.520]  that made her way up in the Navy.
[1:35:40.520 --> 1:35:43.520]  No, this is the Washington Post with a straight face.
[1:35:43.520 --> 1:35:46.520]  It's Rachel Levine, the super creepy dude.
[1:35:46.520 --> 1:35:49.520]  I mean, there's no end to this, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:35:49.520 --> 1:35:51.520]  And see, now the left's trying to say,
[1:35:51.520 --> 1:35:53.520]  if an adult has sex with a child,
[1:35:53.520 --> 1:35:56.520]  but the leftist sees themselves as a child,
[1:35:56.520 --> 1:35:58.520]  it's not pedophilia.
[1:35:58.520 --> 1:36:00.520]  That's where they're going with all this.
[1:36:00.520 --> 1:36:02.520]  Mind control.
[1:36:02.520 --> 1:36:03.520]  And then when they create,
[1:36:03.520 --> 1:36:04.520]  which they've created, the human oise
[1:36:04.520 --> 1:36:05.520]  that are part animal, part human,
[1:36:05.520 --> 1:36:07.520]  that don't have any rights,
[1:36:07.520 --> 1:36:08.520]  well, now they're gonna endow them
[1:36:08.520 --> 1:36:10.520]  with what they don't have any rights.
[1:36:10.520 --> 1:36:11.520]  Well, now they're gonna endow them
[1:36:11.520 --> 1:36:13.520]  with what they don't have any rights.
[1:36:13.520 --> 1:36:16.520]  But they own them and control them.
[1:36:16.520 --> 1:36:18.520]  And you better not criticize the real trans
[1:36:18.520 --> 1:36:21.520]  zoological creature.
[1:36:21.520 --> 1:36:23.520]  So let's do this.
[1:36:23.520 --> 1:36:26.520]  I did massive preparation for this over five days.
[1:36:26.520 --> 1:36:29.520]  And again, I try to figure out the mental reasons
[1:36:29.520 --> 1:36:31.520]  that once I get on air,
[1:36:31.520 --> 1:36:33.520]  I don't want to talk about it or get into it.
[1:36:33.520 --> 1:36:35.520]  There's like a block, but...
[1:36:35.520 --> 1:36:37.520]  I don't want to talk about it.
[1:36:37.520 --> 1:36:39.520]  I don't want to talk about it.
[1:36:39.520 --> 1:36:40.520]  I don't want to talk about it.
[1:36:40.520 --> 1:36:42.520]  I don't want to talk about it.
[1:36:42.520 --> 1:36:44.520]  I'm gonna do it.
[1:36:44.520 --> 1:36:45.520]  I'm gonna do it next hour.
[1:36:45.520 --> 1:36:47.520]  I'm gonna do it the start of the next hour.
[1:36:47.520 --> 1:36:49.520]  And I know what the mental block is now that I say it.
[1:36:49.520 --> 1:36:51.520]  It's that I can't do it justice.
[1:36:51.520 --> 1:36:53.520]  I was already working on NATO
[1:36:53.520 --> 1:36:55.520]  and their plan to take over the U.S.
[1:36:55.520 --> 1:36:57.520]  and I started talking about it last week.
[1:36:57.520 --> 1:36:59.520]  And then a caller called in and said,
[1:36:59.520 --> 1:37:01.520]  oh, have you seen this, which I hadn't seen,
[1:37:01.520 --> 1:37:04.520]  which is even worse than what I said.
[1:37:04.520 --> 1:37:08.520]  So I spent about 30 minutes this morning
[1:37:08.520 --> 1:37:12.520]  trying to read, scan over 100-plus pages.
[1:37:12.520 --> 1:37:14.520]  And I found so much horrible stuff
[1:37:14.520 --> 1:37:17.520]  that I could do five weeks of shows on this.
[1:37:17.520 --> 1:37:19.520]  So, I mean, it's like, I'm not a victim.
[1:37:19.520 --> 1:37:20.520]  I feel beat up.
[1:37:20.520 --> 1:37:22.520]  It's like I've been punched in the stomach about 10 times.
[1:37:22.520 --> 1:37:24.520]  Because the people that run NATO
[1:37:24.520 --> 1:37:26.520]  are the ones kidnapping kids and running everything.
[1:37:26.520 --> 1:37:28.520]  I mean, that's the top of the pyramid right here.
[1:37:28.520 --> 1:37:29.520]  The group that runs NATO.
[1:37:29.520 --> 1:37:31.520]  That's the international global script.
[1:37:31.520 --> 1:37:34.520]  And this is how they're gonna put chips in your brains,
[1:37:34.520 --> 1:37:36.520]  how they own you, how they control you.
[1:37:36.520 --> 1:37:38.520]  This is just one thing.
[1:37:38.520 --> 1:37:44.520]  This is Science Technology Trends 2020-2040
[1:37:44.520 --> 1:37:46.520]  exploring the CNT Edge,
[1:37:46.520 --> 1:37:49.520]  NATO Science Technology Organization.
[1:37:49.520 --> 1:37:53.520]  Now, what was I already studying five days ago
[1:37:53.520 --> 1:37:55.520]  before we called in about this at Nightmare?
[1:37:55.520 --> 1:38:00.520]  It's basically the same thing, but even worse.
[1:38:00.520 --> 1:38:02.520]  NATO's plans to hack your brain.
[1:38:02.520 --> 1:38:04.520]  Remember that zero hedge article?
[1:38:04.520 --> 1:38:07.520]  And I've got the document right here.
[1:38:07.520 --> 1:38:10.520]  I'm gonna hit that next hour.
[1:38:10.520 --> 1:38:11.520]  I said I'd hit it Friday.
[1:38:11.520 --> 1:38:13.520]  I said I'd hit it Saturday, Sunday.
[1:38:13.520 --> 1:38:14.520]  Never hit it.
[1:38:14.520 --> 1:38:15.520]  Saturday, Sunday, never hit it.
[1:38:15.520 --> 1:38:19.520]  I'm gonna hit it next hour.
[1:38:19.520 --> 1:38:21.520]  And then I'm gonna hit this.
[1:38:21.520 --> 1:38:26.520]  Because you wanna know what's really going on.
[1:38:26.520 --> 1:38:27.520]  You wanna know what they know
[1:38:27.520 --> 1:38:29.520]  and what they don't want you to know?
[1:38:29.520 --> 1:38:31.520]  It's right here in this folder.
[1:38:31.520 --> 1:38:34.520]  And if I spent 20 years on this,
[1:38:34.520 --> 1:38:36.520]  it wouldn't be long enough.
[1:38:36.520 --> 1:38:41.520]  The Observer Effect and Quantum Physics.
[1:38:41.520 --> 1:38:46.520]  Now, this is just a tiny little sliver of power.
[1:38:46.520 --> 1:38:51.520]  This, in my hand, is the ultimate power
[1:38:51.520 --> 1:38:53.520]  in the universe beneath God.
[1:38:53.520 --> 1:38:56.520]  This is, in fact, God's will.
[1:38:56.520 --> 1:38:59.520]  And we have been given little G, God-like powers.
[1:38:59.520 --> 1:39:04.520]  Observed by electron microscopes, spectrometers,
[1:39:04.520 --> 1:39:06.520]  you name it, all the systems.
[1:39:06.520 --> 1:39:08.520]  And they already knew this theoretically.
[1:39:08.520 --> 1:39:09.520]  And it's been proven.
[1:39:09.520 --> 1:39:10.520]  And that's what they're doing.
[1:39:10.520 --> 1:39:13.520]  And that's how they're programming your subconscious.
[1:39:13.520 --> 1:39:16.520]  I will hit this as well.
[1:39:16.520 --> 1:39:20.520]  But I'm gonna do an entire long presentation on this soon.
[1:39:20.520 --> 1:39:22.520]  And I've been quietly working on this for a while.
[1:39:22.520 --> 1:39:23.520]  And that's why I've decided
[1:39:23.520 --> 1:39:28.520]  you can't just do 20, 30 minutes on this very soon.
[1:39:28.520 --> 1:39:31.520]  And if I work hard and we're on schedule right now,
[1:39:31.520 --> 1:39:36.520]  by the mid-December, there will be a film,
[1:39:36.520 --> 1:39:45.520]  an entire production, on the Observer Effect and Quantum Physics.
[1:39:45.520 --> 1:39:46.520]  And I've not talked about this
[1:39:46.520 --> 1:39:48.520]  because it's so big and so important.
[1:39:48.520 --> 1:39:49.520]  I mean, I've talked about it a lot.
[1:39:49.520 --> 1:39:51.520]  I've mentioned it and given you the basics.
[1:39:51.520 --> 1:39:52.520]  I know most of you already know about it.
[1:39:52.520 --> 1:39:56.520]  But, I mean, what does it really mean?
[1:39:56.520 --> 1:39:59.520]  This is why there isn't one person
[1:39:59.520 --> 1:40:01.520]  that is a controller that believes
[1:40:01.520 --> 1:40:03.520]  that there isn't God or is it demented.
[1:40:03.520 --> 1:40:05.520]  They all know.
[1:40:05.520 --> 1:40:08.520]  The God Particle.
[1:40:08.520 --> 1:40:11.520]  Theoretically, you know, cooked up by Max Planck
[1:40:11.520 --> 1:40:14.520]  and then the guy that was certainly smart
[1:40:14.520 --> 1:40:16.520]  but took a lot of it and then just popularized it.
[1:40:16.520 --> 1:40:18.520]  That's Albert Einstein.
[1:40:18.520 --> 1:40:21.520]  But Ms. Max Planck's the super genius.
[1:40:21.520 --> 1:40:23.520]  Einstein's the genius.
[1:40:23.520 --> 1:40:24.520]  Nobody's saying he's a lot of genius.
[1:40:24.520 --> 1:40:26.520]  He's freaking smart.
[1:40:26.520 --> 1:40:28.520]  I mean, autistic mathematician,
[1:40:28.520 --> 1:40:31.520]  but Max Planck was the big daddy.
[1:40:31.520 --> 1:40:35.520]  124 years ago, he came up with all the theoretic equations
[1:40:35.520 --> 1:40:38.520]  for atomic bombs on a chalkboard.
[1:40:38.520 --> 1:40:40.520]  Yeah, that guy.
[1:40:40.520 --> 1:40:43.520]  So, we're going to be talking about that.
[1:40:43.520 --> 1:40:45.520]  And I remember being three years old,
[1:40:45.520 --> 1:40:47.520]  five years old, 10 years old,
[1:40:47.520 --> 1:40:49.520]  being sent for a week during the summers
[1:40:49.520 --> 1:40:51.520]  to stay with my grandparents
[1:40:51.520 --> 1:40:53.520]  and getting in trouble sneaking out in the middle of the night
[1:40:53.520 --> 1:40:55.520]  to go to the park across the street,
[1:40:55.520 --> 1:40:56.520]  my grandmother screaming at me,
[1:40:56.520 --> 1:40:58.520]  but they were really sweet, but a little stuff like that.
[1:40:58.520 --> 1:41:00.520]  And I remember my grandfather yelling at me in a nice way
[1:41:00.520 --> 1:41:03.520]  about quantum mechanics and Max Planck.
[1:41:03.520 --> 1:41:06.520]  And I didn't know that he was all into that
[1:41:06.520 --> 1:41:11.520]  and went and saw, you know, really select seminars
[1:41:11.520 --> 1:41:14.520]  and things that not everybody got into
[1:41:14.520 --> 1:41:17.520]  with these physicists that came after Planck
[1:41:17.520 --> 1:41:19.520]  and Werner von Braun and all of it.
[1:41:19.520 --> 1:41:21.520]  He was a pretty smart guy.
[1:41:21.520 --> 1:41:23.520]  But it's funny, all of a sudden he was telling me back then
[1:41:23.520 --> 1:41:27.520]  it just comes to mind, and we've been living all of this
[1:41:27.520 --> 1:41:29.520]  and not understanding it.
[1:41:29.520 --> 1:41:34.520]  So, this is basically like discovering the keys to the car
[1:41:34.520 --> 1:41:37.520]  that's all juiced up and loaded up with fuel
[1:41:37.520 --> 1:41:39.520]  and ready to drive down the road.
[1:41:39.520 --> 1:41:42.520]  And it's like a baby finally having the consciousness moment
[1:41:42.520 --> 1:41:47.520]  where the baby realizes, I am conscious, I am a consciousness.
[1:41:47.520 --> 1:41:51.520]  And how much power you've got.
[1:41:51.520 --> 1:41:57.520]  So, that's coming up today.
[1:41:57.520 --> 1:41:59.520]  And I'm going to get more into it,
[1:41:59.520 --> 1:42:01.520]  and I've already been doing a lot of work on it
[1:42:01.520 --> 1:42:04.520]  and a lot of research, and we're shooting and editing
[1:42:04.520 --> 1:42:06.520]  and putting all this together right now.
[1:42:06.520 --> 1:42:08.520]  And that's just one, as I told you,
[1:42:08.520 --> 1:42:14.520]  eight big projects that we got going on simultaneously.
[1:42:14.520 --> 1:42:19.520]  That's why I'm working 18 hours a day with extreme enjoyment
[1:42:19.520 --> 1:42:23.520]  because I'm plugged directly into the zeitgeist, and so are you.
[1:42:23.520 --> 1:42:25.520]  But you have to first realize that.
[1:42:25.520 --> 1:42:31.520]  And once you do, well, primary ignition has begun.
[1:42:31.520 --> 1:42:32.520]  We'll be right back.
[1:42:32.520 --> 1:42:36.520]  I'm Alex Jones, infowars.com.
[1:42:36.520 --> 1:42:43.520]  Next Millennium's News Today.
[1:42:43.520 --> 1:42:45.520]  Now you've heard me talk about the BioProse
[1:42:45.520 --> 1:42:47.520]  and how they're creating amazing products.
[1:42:47.520 --> 1:42:49.520]  They've done it again and have just released
[1:42:49.520 --> 1:42:52.520]  an entire suite of bio-remediation products
[1:42:52.520 --> 1:42:56.520]  bringing industrial-level technology to the everyday consumer.
[1:42:56.520 --> 1:42:58.520]  They're literally changing the industry
[1:42:58.520 --> 1:43:00.520]  with a revolutionary patented delivery system.
[1:43:00.520 --> 1:43:04.520]  The BioProse are excited to release Biodrain Pro,
[1:43:04.520 --> 1:43:07.520]  a product specifically designed to establish healthy drains,
[1:43:07.520 --> 1:43:09.520]  pipes, and overall plumbing systems.
[1:43:09.520 --> 1:43:11.520]  Biodrain Pro digests grease,
[1:43:11.520 --> 1:43:15.520]  fats, oils, sludge, paper, and organic matter with ease.
[1:43:15.520 --> 1:43:18.520]  It contains no chemicals, no GMOs,
[1:43:18.520 --> 1:43:22.520]  and is safe for black-gray holding tanks, sewer hoses, and plumbing.
[1:43:22.520 --> 1:43:24.520]  It is also human and animal safe.

[1:43:32.520 --> 1:43:34.520]  Guaranteed.
[1:43:34.520 --> 1:43:35.520]  Just pour and add water.
[1:43:35.520 --> 1:43:36.520]  It's that simple.
[1:43:36.520 --> 1:43:42.520]  Visit thebioprose.com and see for yourself.
[1:43:42.520 --> 1:43:45.520]  One of the most studied and researched areas
[1:43:45.520 --> 1:43:48.520]  of human health and physiology is inflammation.
[1:43:48.520 --> 1:43:49.520]  It's associated with cancer.
[1:43:49.520 --> 1:43:51.520]  It's associated with joint problems.
[1:43:51.520 --> 1:43:54.520]  It's associated with viral infections, bacterial infections.
[1:43:54.520 --> 1:43:56.520]  It's associated with death.
[1:43:56.520 --> 1:43:59.520]  And out of all the incredible compounds that God gave us through nature
[1:43:59.520 --> 1:44:02.520]  that fights inflammation and makes our lives better,
[1:44:02.520 --> 1:44:04.520]  turmeric is chief amongst them all.
[1:44:04.520 --> 1:44:08.520]  And chief amongst all the turmeric products out there
[1:44:08.520 --> 1:44:10.520]  is body's ultimate turmeric formula.
[1:44:10.520 --> 1:44:11.520]  My wife loves turmeric.
[1:44:11.520 --> 1:44:13.520]  She has joint pain, but she has to take a lot of it,
[1:44:13.520 --> 1:44:16.520]  the type of stuff she buys at the grocery store for it to work.
[1:44:16.520 --> 1:44:17.520]  She started taking this and said,
[1:44:17.520 --> 1:44:19.520]  I only need to take one pill instead of four.
[1:44:19.520 --> 1:44:20.520]  Why is it so good?
[1:44:20.520 --> 1:44:21.520]  It's not just turmeric.
[1:44:21.520 --> 1:44:24.520]  It's concentrated with the proprietary process.
[1:44:24.520 --> 1:44:28.520]  It's back in stock after being sold out almost five months

[1:44:34.520 --> 1:44:36.520]  And because we will not lower the quality of this product.

[1:47:08.520 --> 1:47:18.520]  2021.
[1:47:18.520 --> 1:47:21.520]  The globalists want you dead because they're selfish
[1:47:21.520 --> 1:47:26.520]  and they don't want you having the keys of destiny.
[1:47:26.520 --> 1:47:30.520]  If you have the keys of destiny.
[1:47:30.520 --> 1:47:35.520]  And you will use them or you will be enslaved.
[1:47:35.520 --> 1:47:38.520]  And the enemies of humanity are unified.
[1:47:38.520 --> 1:47:40.520]  The left, the radical Islamists,
[1:47:40.520 --> 1:47:43.520]  the Pope that's hijacked and controls the Catholic Church,
[1:47:43.520 --> 1:47:45.520]  Hollywood, the Democratic Party,
[1:47:45.520 --> 1:47:49.520]  all of these different organizations, big tech.
[1:47:49.520 --> 1:47:52.520]  They all represent the same evil force
[1:47:52.520 --> 1:47:54.520]  that wants to kill free will.
[1:47:54.520 --> 1:48:00.520]  And now this just broke at infowarstore.com.
[1:48:00.520 --> 1:48:04.520]  Directly officially announced by the Pope
[1:48:04.520 --> 1:48:09.520]  ex-cathedra from his black throne.
[1:48:09.520 --> 1:48:15.520]  Pope demands Silicon Valley in the name of God.
[1:48:15.520 --> 1:48:20.520]  That's a quote, censor, quote, hate speech
[1:48:20.520 --> 1:48:23.520]  and conspiracy theories, close quote.
[1:48:23.520 --> 1:48:25.520]  Yeah, who's writing his script?
[1:48:25.520 --> 1:48:27.520]  Same folks writing the ADL script,
[1:48:27.520 --> 1:48:29.520]  Southern priority law script, the UN script.
[1:48:29.520 --> 1:48:32.520]  It's all one mouth, vomiting it out
[1:48:32.520 --> 1:48:35.520]  and they all pick it back up and gobble it up
[1:48:35.520 --> 1:48:36.520]  and then vomit it back on us.
[1:48:36.520 --> 1:48:39.520]  But he's one of the biggest mouths out there.
[1:48:39.520 --> 1:48:42.520]  He said questioning authority and a questioning the EU
[1:48:42.520 --> 1:48:44.520]  and the globalist, remember two years ago,
[1:48:44.520 --> 1:48:48.520]  was like those fascinated with eating human feces.
[1:48:48.520 --> 1:48:49.520]  I never even thought of that.
[1:48:49.520 --> 1:48:50.520]  I looked up the word he said
[1:48:50.520 --> 1:48:53.520]  and he kind of tells us what he's into, right?
[1:48:53.520 --> 1:48:55.520]  Pope, I mean, I'm serious, he does do that.
[1:48:55.520 --> 1:48:57.520]  You know that to defile his body
[1:48:57.520 --> 1:48:59.520]  and cut himself off from God.
[1:48:59.520 --> 1:49:00.520]  Believe me, that's the bare minimum this guy does.
[1:49:00.520 --> 1:49:03.520]  He oversees pure Satanism.
[1:49:03.520 --> 1:49:05.520]  So, Pope demands Silicon Valley
[1:49:05.520 --> 1:49:10.520]  in the name of God censor hate speech, conspiracy theories.
[1:49:10.520 --> 1:49:12.520]  So he is the anti-Christ general
[1:49:12.520 --> 1:49:15.520]  now occupying the Vatican.
[1:49:15.520 --> 1:49:18.520]  Pope Francis invoked God in an effort
[1:49:18.520 --> 1:49:20.520]  to pressure Silicon Valley giants
[1:49:20.520 --> 1:49:23.520]  into censoring more content.
[1:49:23.520 --> 1:49:24.520]  They're so desperate,
[1:49:24.520 --> 1:49:26.520]  including hate speech and conspiracy theories.
[1:49:26.520 --> 1:49:29.520]  Yes, really, the Pope made the remarks
[1:49:29.520 --> 1:49:32.520]  during a worldwide meeting of popular movements.
[1:49:32.520 --> 1:49:35.520]  Ah, not too much promoting Christianity there.
[1:49:35.520 --> 1:49:39.520]  A shadowy organization created to promote social justice.
[1:49:39.520 --> 1:49:41.520]  Oh, George Soros.
[1:49:41.520 --> 1:49:45.520]  And fight racism with the help of religious leaders.
[1:49:45.520 --> 1:49:47.520]  He said, I don't want to hear about Europe's Christian roots.
[1:49:47.520 --> 1:49:49.520]  That makes me nauseous.
[1:49:49.520 --> 1:49:51.520]  Yes, it isn't like a steaming bowl of poop.
[1:49:51.520 --> 1:49:54.520]  It's not delicious like the things you like.
[1:49:54.520 --> 1:49:57.520]  Jesus is horrible to you, isn't it?
[1:49:57.520 --> 1:49:59.520]  We can't even say his name.
[1:49:59.520 --> 1:50:01.520]  I wonder if there's any video of this guy
[1:50:01.520 --> 1:50:02.520]  even saying the word Jesus.
[1:50:02.520 --> 1:50:04.520]  I don't think he probably can burst the flame if he did.
[1:50:04.520 --> 1:50:07.520]  In the name of God, he said, not Jesus.
[1:50:07.520 --> 1:50:09.520]  Let's say this name of Jesus.
[1:50:09.520 --> 1:50:10.520]  He said that now.
[1:50:10.520 --> 1:50:12.520]  In the name of God, what God is that?
[1:50:12.520 --> 1:50:17.520]  In the name of God, I asked the technology giants to stop
[1:50:17.520 --> 1:50:19.520]  exploiting human weakness,
[1:50:19.520 --> 1:50:20.520]  which again, this is all true.
[1:50:20.520 --> 1:50:22.520]  They're doing it, but he's going along with their agenda.
[1:50:22.520 --> 1:50:25.520]  See, it's like that whistleblower that calls for more censorship.
[1:50:25.520 --> 1:50:26.520]  She's not a whistleblower.
[1:50:26.520 --> 1:50:28.520]  They want to pose as if they're anti-establishment.
[1:50:28.520 --> 1:50:30.520]  It's like, please don't throw me in the briar patch.
[1:50:30.520 --> 1:50:33.520]  In the name of God, I asked the technology giants
[1:50:33.520 --> 1:50:35.520]  to stop exploiting human weakness,
[1:50:35.520 --> 1:50:37.520]  people's vulnerability for the sake of profits
[1:50:37.520 --> 1:50:39.520]  without caring about the spread of hate speech,
[1:50:39.520 --> 1:50:40.520]  the grooming.
[1:50:40.520 --> 1:50:42.520]  Oh, the grooming.
[1:50:42.520 --> 1:50:44.520]  Wow, that's the fox telling us about the hen house.
[1:50:44.520 --> 1:50:47.520]  Fake news, conspiracy theories,
[1:50:47.520 --> 1:50:49.520]  and political manipulation, he stated.
[1:50:49.520 --> 1:50:52.520]  Pope Francis also invoked the term post-truth.
[1:50:52.520 --> 1:50:54.520]  I mean, this is all just New York Times stuff,
[1:50:54.520 --> 1:50:57.520]  which was invented by establishment media organs
[1:50:57.520 --> 1:51:00.520]  after they began to lose their monopoly of controlling the narrative,
[1:51:00.520 --> 1:51:04.520]  following the election of their dear leader,
[1:51:04.520 --> 1:51:07.520]  apparently believes that Christian and Godly
[1:51:07.520 --> 1:51:11.520]  to empower giant corporations to shut down free speech.
[1:51:11.520 --> 1:51:14.520]  And again, the computer printed this twice.
[1:51:14.520 --> 1:51:15.520]  I can't read it.
[1:51:15.520 --> 1:51:17.520]  The election of Joe Biden is leader.
[1:51:17.520 --> 1:51:22.520]  There is no surprise given his previous stance on free speech
[1:51:22.520 --> 1:51:27.520]  in response to the slaughter of Charlie Hebdo Cartonis
[1:51:27.520 --> 1:51:29.520]  when he rhetorically sided with the terrorists
[1:51:29.520 --> 1:51:32.520]  who murdered them in cold blood.
[1:51:32.520 --> 1:51:34.520]  As we documented in the video below,
[1:51:34.520 --> 1:51:37.520]  which Pope Francis would surely love to see banned,
[1:51:37.520 --> 1:51:39.520]  the Supreme Pontus smears his critics
[1:51:39.520 --> 1:51:44.520]  as performing the work of the devil.
[1:51:44.520 --> 1:51:46.520]  In reality, his every action and position
[1:51:46.520 --> 1:51:49.520]  has served to further the anti-Christ globalist beast system
[1:51:49.520 --> 1:51:51.520]  for which he is a willing puppet.
[1:51:51.520 --> 1:51:53.520]  Ooh, Paul Watson.
[1:51:53.520 --> 1:51:55.520]  Now Paul starts to figure it out.
[1:51:55.520 --> 1:52:00.520]  No doubt the Pope would respond to such claims
[1:52:00.520 --> 1:52:04.520]  by characterizing them as conspiracy theories and hate speech.
[1:52:04.520 --> 1:52:06.520]  And beginning to see how the world works,
[1:52:06.520 --> 1:52:08.520]  then Paul's got a bunch of videos there for you to see.
[1:52:08.520 --> 1:52:10.520]  Wow.
[1:52:10.520 --> 1:52:12.520]  And I mean, I can't even get to all the news I've got here
[1:52:12.520 --> 1:52:14.520]  because this just stuff keeps breaking.
[1:52:14.520 --> 1:52:18.520]  And we've got a new first woman four-star admiral that's a dude.
[1:52:18.520 --> 1:52:19.520]  It's a freak show, folks.
[1:52:19.520 --> 1:52:21.520]  It's designed to get you all balanced
[1:52:21.520 --> 1:52:23.520]  where you just put up with anything.
[1:52:23.520 --> 1:52:26.520]  How do they get us to put up with martial law and all this?
[1:52:26.520 --> 1:52:28.520]  Or Satanism openly being practiced in the schools,
[1:52:28.520 --> 1:52:30.520]  put up big satanic monuments in front of the churches,
[1:52:30.520 --> 1:52:32.520]  in front of the government buildings.
[1:52:32.520 --> 1:52:36.520]  All of this is, you're already under martial law with the lockdowns.
[1:52:36.520 --> 1:52:39.520]  You're already in it.
[1:52:39.520 --> 1:52:42.520]  And then Dr. Bartlett, who's an amazing person,
[1:52:42.520 --> 1:52:45.520]  he works like 20 hours a day trying to save people.
[1:52:45.520 --> 1:52:47.520]  Save my dad, no doubt.
[1:52:47.520 --> 1:52:49.520]  He's just sending messages.
[1:52:49.520 --> 1:52:51.520]  Look, here's CBS News locally confirming they put bags
[1:52:51.520 --> 1:52:52.520]  over people's heads.
[1:52:52.520 --> 1:52:54.520]  Here's another place in another state where the whole body's got a bag on it.
[1:52:54.520 --> 1:52:56.520]  This is going to kill people.
[1:52:56.520 --> 1:52:58.520]  Next, they'll be taping it around their heads,
[1:52:58.520 --> 1:53:00.520]  and then this morning it broke.
[1:53:00.520 --> 1:53:04.520]  They're now taping the bags around the head and actually killing people.
[1:53:04.520 --> 1:53:06.520]  Hypoxia.
[1:53:06.520 --> 1:53:09.520]  When you see in a movie where they put the bag on their head and kill somebody,
[1:53:09.520 --> 1:53:10.520]  that's real.
[1:53:10.520 --> 1:53:12.520]  Well, now that's medical care.
[1:53:12.520 --> 1:53:13.520]  You're like, that's not medical care.
[1:53:13.520 --> 1:53:14.520]  Yes, it is.
[1:53:14.520 --> 1:53:16.520]  In fact, the left says it's good for babies to be aborted.
[1:53:16.520 --> 1:53:18.520]  They'd have horrible lives.
[1:53:18.520 --> 1:53:19.520]  See, same thing.
[1:53:19.520 --> 1:53:23.520]  Teachers at Colorado Springs force children to take masks to their faces
[1:53:23.520 --> 1:53:27.520]  over the top because they don't want any of the other air getting in,
[1:53:27.520 --> 1:53:30.520]  just like new videos have come out on CBS News,
[1:53:30.520 --> 1:53:33.520]  and we can put that screenshot up, I sent it to you,
[1:53:33.520 --> 1:53:36.520]  where they've got bags all the way down the body.
[1:53:36.520 --> 1:53:38.520]  And it's now confirmed.
[1:53:38.520 --> 1:53:41.520]  People when we first reported that last week thought it was made up.
[1:53:41.520 --> 1:53:44.520]  No.
[1:53:44.520 --> 1:53:46.520]  There's audio in the article because the students, you know,
[1:53:46.520 --> 1:53:48.520]  and their cameras at the floor of it happening.
[1:53:48.520 --> 1:53:52.520]  Let me just stop right here for just a moment to say this
[1:53:52.520 --> 1:53:53.520]  because I didn't plug last hour.
[1:53:53.520 --> 1:53:55.520]  I need to or we won't be here.
[1:53:55.520 --> 1:53:57.520]  I'm just going to keep fighting as long as we can stay on air.
[1:53:57.520 --> 1:54:00.520]  We're not going to be able to stay on air unless you financially support us.
[1:54:00.520 --> 1:54:03.520]  And you've been doing that except now with the supply chain breakdowns,
[1:54:03.520 --> 1:54:06.520]  as you now see everywhere that we predicted 20 months ago,
[1:54:06.520 --> 1:54:08.520]  what in order to predict it was part of the lovelace plan.
[1:54:08.520 --> 1:54:09.520]  It's like we have their playbook.
[1:54:09.520 --> 1:54:11.520]  I think they'll play this play when this happens.
[1:54:11.520 --> 1:54:12.520]  And they're like, oh my God, they just did it.
[1:54:12.520 --> 1:54:13.520]  Yeah, we have the playbook.
[1:54:13.520 --> 1:54:15.520]  So I don't get the credit, folks.
[1:54:15.520 --> 1:54:16.520]  This is out in the open.
[1:54:16.520 --> 1:54:19.520]  But we are the ones that have the courage to talk about it.
[1:54:19.520 --> 1:54:22.520]  And you have the courage to promote us and get the word out and keep us on air.
[1:54:22.520 --> 1:54:23.520]  So you are the fight.
[1:54:23.520 --> 1:54:24.520]  You are the info war.
[1:54:24.520 --> 1:54:29.520]  But just pulling back from this, we've been sold out all these products
[1:54:29.520 --> 1:54:31.520]  that normally we sell enough of to stay on air
[1:54:31.520 --> 1:54:34.520]  and actually expand in the face of the globalist.
[1:54:34.520 --> 1:54:36.520]  I want to expand during this critical time.
[1:54:36.520 --> 1:54:37.520]  But it hasn't happened.
[1:54:37.520 --> 1:54:41.520]  And so sometimes we're out of products for almost a year or six or eight months.
[1:54:41.520 --> 1:54:43.520]  DNA force finally came back in.
[1:54:43.520 --> 1:54:44.520]  We've got it back in stock.
[1:54:44.520 --> 1:54:45.520]  It's amazing.
[1:54:45.520 --> 1:54:48.520]  And now we have bodies, ultimate turmeric formula back in stock.
[1:54:48.520 --> 1:54:51.520]  We got a good shipment of it, but it's still going to sell out in a month or so.
[1:54:51.520 --> 1:54:54.520]  And it'll be probably four or five, six months before we get more.
[1:54:54.520 --> 1:54:56.520]  It is 95% per secret humanoid.
[1:54:56.520 --> 1:54:59.520]  And it's 40% off for one week only.
[1:54:59.520 --> 1:55:02.520]  Inflammation is such an issue with people out there.
[1:55:02.520 --> 1:55:05.520]  And turmeric is known to be, of all the things God gave us through nature,
[1:55:05.520 --> 1:55:06.520]  the most powerful.
[1:55:06.520 --> 1:55:11.520]  Well, this is concentrated 95% per humanoid from a leading brand
[1:55:11.520 --> 1:55:13.520]  that we did not private label.
[1:55:13.520 --> 1:55:18.520]  They were telling us they were 40 something percent per humanoid in their patented process,
[1:55:18.520 --> 1:55:20.520]  which we checked, you know, and had tested.
[1:55:20.520 --> 1:55:21.520]  It's true.
[1:55:21.520 --> 1:55:24.520]  They said, but we could go as high as 94, 95%.
[1:55:24.520 --> 1:55:26.520]  But it costs this much more.
[1:55:26.520 --> 1:55:27.520]  We did it.
[1:55:27.520 --> 1:55:28.520]  They did it.
[1:55:28.520 --> 1:55:32.520]  95% per humanoid, 95% per humanoid.
[1:55:32.520 --> 1:55:35.520]  And again, my wife plays a lot of tennis, a lot of sports.
[1:55:35.520 --> 1:55:39.520]  And, you know, she's very competitive, one of the highest rated in Austin.
[1:55:39.520 --> 1:55:41.520]  And she, her hip hurts from it.
[1:55:41.520 --> 1:55:43.520]  And she takes these big horse pill temperates.
[1:55:43.520 --> 1:55:45.520]  And a couple of years ago when this came out, I said, take this.
[1:55:45.520 --> 1:55:46.520]  Start taking, like, five big pills.
[1:55:46.520 --> 1:55:50.520]  She goes, it takes this much, but it works better, you know, than Advil and stuff.
[1:55:50.520 --> 1:55:51.520]  And Tylenol.
[1:55:51.520 --> 1:55:52.520]  And she even took painkillers.
[1:55:52.520 --> 1:55:53.520]  Sometimes it hurts so bad.
[1:55:53.520 --> 1:55:54.520]  Almost had surgery.
[1:55:54.520 --> 1:55:55.520]  And she took this.
[1:55:55.520 --> 1:55:57.520]  She said, my God, I just took one or two pills.
[1:55:57.520 --> 1:55:59.520]  It worked as good as five or six big ones.
[1:55:59.520 --> 1:56:00.520]  But it shows a lower milligram.
[1:56:00.520 --> 1:56:02.520]  And I said, it's concentrated.
[1:56:02.520 --> 1:56:05.520]  It's according to the rules, you just call it turmeric, but it's a concentrate.
[1:56:05.520 --> 1:56:09.520]  So this is what she takes religiously and 99% less complaining.
[1:56:09.520 --> 1:56:11.520]  It worked, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:56:11.520 --> 1:56:13.520]  That's the power of what God gave us.
[1:56:13.520 --> 1:56:16.520]  And then humans are able to concentrate it and make it even stronger.
[1:56:16.520 --> 1:56:24.520]  So, body's ultimate turmeric formula, back in stock at infowarstore.com or call toll free.
[1:56:24.520 --> 1:56:34.520]  That's triple eight, two, five, three, three, one, three, nine, triple eight, two, five, three, three, one, three, nine.
[1:56:34.520 --> 1:56:37.520]  Or you can simply again go to infowarstore.com.
[1:56:37.520 --> 1:56:40.520]  We have down and out is still 50% off.
[1:56:40.520 --> 1:56:45.520]  We had to end the sale on ultra 12 and winter sun because it's getting close to selling out more coming in in a few months.
[1:56:45.520 --> 1:56:46.520]  But we still have it.
[1:56:46.520 --> 1:56:49.520]  It's still discounted 25%, just not 50.
[1:56:49.520 --> 1:56:54.520]  I'm extending DNA force a few more days at 40% off that extends your telomeres.
[1:56:54.520 --> 1:56:57.520]  It doesn't grow them, but makes them last longer, which is the same thing.
[1:56:57.520 --> 1:56:59.520]  And this is observable.
[1:56:59.520 --> 1:57:00.520]  It's documented.
[1:57:00.520 --> 1:57:01.520]  It's proven.
[1:57:01.520 --> 1:57:03.520]  And it's got the PQQ, the CoQ10, and so much more.
[1:57:03.520 --> 1:57:10.520]  That is the rules Royce for yourselves, for your mitochondria, for everything else, for your immune system, DNA force plus.
[1:57:10.520 --> 1:57:17.520]  But body's ultimate turmeric formula, 40% off, limited time in fowarstore.com.
[1:57:17.520 --> 1:57:19.520]  And we just got it back in again.
[1:57:19.520 --> 1:57:20.520]  It was only sold out for a month.
[1:57:20.520 --> 1:57:24.520]  We have charcoal toothpaste with activated charcoal concentrated in mouthwash.
[1:57:24.520 --> 1:57:26.520]  Designed by my dad, a dentist.
[1:57:26.520 --> 1:57:27.520]  It's amazing.
[1:57:27.520 --> 1:57:29.520]  No fillers at infowarstore.com.
[1:57:29.520 --> 1:57:33.520]  Get that as well.
[1:57:33.520 --> 1:57:35.520]  I'm sitting here.
[1:57:35.520 --> 1:57:46.520]  It's in the early morning hours and I'm looking at mainstream news reporting on the fact that even the controlled revolving door FDA has come out and said
[1:57:46.520 --> 1:57:54.520]  that the Moderna and Pfizer shots need to be held up and not authorized for children because in studies they did on children it caused myocarditis.
[1:57:54.520 --> 1:57:57.520]  That's heart swelling and heart attacks.
[1:57:57.520 --> 1:58:02.520]  And then I noticed that even though this is even in the Associated Press, it's not getting any circulation.
[1:58:02.520 --> 1:58:06.520]  It's not on the national news and it's very hard to even find on places like Instagram or Twitter.
[1:58:06.520 --> 1:58:07.520]  It's just crazy.
[1:58:07.520 --> 1:58:12.520]  And then Fauci was on TV just yesterday saying there's no damage from the vaccines.
[1:58:12.520 --> 1:58:16.520]  It doesn't hurt anybody, you're a conspiracy theorist if you say it.
[1:58:16.520 --> 1:58:17.520]  It's just crazy.
[1:58:17.520 --> 1:58:22.520]  And then we have all the scientists who over a year ago came out and said these vaccines are going to cause heart problems.
[1:58:22.520 --> 1:58:25.520]  They gave the exact reasons why and now it happened.
[1:58:25.520 --> 1:58:27.520]  That's why info wars is on air.
[1:58:27.520 --> 1:58:30.520]  Because if we weren't on air, they'd get away with even more of this crap.
[1:58:30.520 --> 1:58:31.520]  This is just insane.
[1:58:31.520 --> 1:58:33.520]  These people are killers.
[1:58:33.520 --> 1:58:45.520]  Because of the globalist reset, info wars listeners and viewers know a lot of our best selling products have been sold out in some cases for up to a year.
[1:58:45.520 --> 1:58:52.520]  Body's ultimate turmeric formula with 95% or 6% of humanoid has been sold out for almost five months.
[1:58:52.520 --> 1:58:58.520]  Because again, the high quality turmeric and the concentration process is very, very expensive and time consuming.
[1:58:58.520 --> 1:59:02.520]  And with the supply chain breakdowns and all the rest of the problems, we've been unable to get it.
[1:59:02.520 --> 1:59:06.520]  But we finally got a shipment in and it's 40% off.
[1:59:06.520 --> 1:59:13.520]  It is the secret weapon when it comes to your immune system, when it comes to antioxidants, when it comes to your joints, when it comes to your whole body.
[1:59:13.520 --> 1:59:17.520]  People absolutely love Body's ultimate turmeric formula.
[1:59:17.520 --> 1:59:20.520]  Incredible amounts of five star reviews at infowarsstore.com.
[1:59:20.520 --> 1:59:24.520]  And it's back in stock at infowarsstore.com and it fuzz the info war.
[1:59:24.520 --> 1:59:26.520]  A true 360 win.
[1:59:26.520 --> 1:59:32.520]  Body's ultimate turmeric formula back in stock at infowarsstore.com for a limited time.
[1:59:37.520 --> 1:59:40.520]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:59:40.520 --> 1:59:52.520]  If I was the devil, I would call good evil and evil good.
[1:59:52.520 --> 1:59:55.520]  I would silence the families I would attack.
[1:59:55.520 --> 1:59:59.520]  Our children, I would say that men are women.
[1:59:59.520 --> 2:00:06.520]  I would promote abortion and phantasy in war and big pharma and poisoned shots.
[2:00:06.520 --> 2:00:08.520]  I would kill, steal and destroy.
[2:00:08.520 --> 2:00:11.520]  If I were the devil, remember Paul Harvey?
[2:00:39.520 --> 2:00:42.520]  I'd support the churches first.
[2:00:42.520 --> 2:00:44.520]  I'd begin with a campaign of whispers.
[2:00:44.520 --> 2:00:47.520]  With the wisdom of the serpent I would whisper to you as I whispered to Eve.
[2:00:47.520 --> 2:00:49.520]  Do as you please.
[2:00:49.520 --> 2:00:51.520]  To the young I would whisper that the Bible is a myth.
[2:00:51.520 --> 2:00:55.520]  I would convince them that man created God instead of the other way around.
[2:00:55.520 --> 2:00:59.520]  I would confide that what's bad is good and what's good is square.
[2:00:59.520 --> 2:01:02.520]  In the old I would teach you to pray after me.
[2:01:02.520 --> 2:01:05.520]  Our father, which art in Washington.
[2:01:05.520 --> 2:01:10.520]  And then I'd get organized. I'd educate authors in how to make lurid literature exciting
[2:01:10.520 --> 2:01:13.520]  so that anything else would appear dull and uninteresting.
[2:01:13.520 --> 2:01:16.520]  I'd threaten TV with dirtier movies and vice versa.
[2:01:16.520 --> 2:01:18.520]  I'd peddle narcotics to whom I could.
[2:01:18.520 --> 2:01:21.520]  I'd sell alcohol to ladies and gentlemen of distinction.
[2:01:21.520 --> 2:01:24.520]  I'd tranquilize the rest with pills.
[2:01:24.520 --> 2:01:28.520]  If I were the devil, I'd soon have families at war with themselves.
[2:01:28.520 --> 2:01:32.520]  Churches at war with themselves and nations at war with themselves
[2:01:32.520 --> 2:01:35.520]  until each in its turn was consumed.
[2:01:35.520 --> 2:01:41.520]  And with promises of higher ratings, I'd have mesmerizing media fanning the play.
[2:01:41.520 --> 2:01:44.520]  The president of the United States is racist.
[2:01:44.520 --> 2:01:48.520]  If I were the devil, I would encourage schools to recline young intellects
[2:01:48.520 --> 2:01:51.520]  but neglect the discipline emotions just when those run wild.
[2:01:51.520 --> 2:01:54.520]  Within a decade, I'd have prisons overflowing.
[2:01:54.520 --> 2:01:56.520]  I'd have judges promoting pornography.
[2:01:56.520 --> 2:02:00.520]  Soon I could evict God from the courthouse, then from the schoolhouse
[2:02:00.520 --> 2:02:02.520]  and then from the houses of Congress.
[2:02:02.520 --> 2:02:07.520]  And in his own churches, I would substitute psychology for religion.
[2:02:07.520 --> 2:02:12.520]  I would lure priests and pastors into misusing boys and girls and church money.
[2:02:12.520 --> 2:02:17.520]  If I were the devil, I'd take from those who have and give to those who wanted
[2:02:17.520 --> 2:02:21.520]  until I had killed the incentive of the ambitious.
[2:02:21.520 --> 2:02:23.520]  I would caution against extremes.
[2:02:23.520 --> 2:02:27.520]  I'm here to warn people. You keep telling me to shut up. This isn't a game.
[2:02:27.520 --> 2:02:31.520]  In hard work, in patriotism, in moral conduct,
[2:02:31.520 --> 2:02:35.520]  I would convince the young that marriage is old-fashioned, that swinging is more fun,
[2:02:35.520 --> 2:02:38.520]  that what you see on TV is the way to be.
[2:02:38.520 --> 2:02:41.520]  And thus I could undress you in public,
[2:02:41.520 --> 2:02:47.520]  and I could lure you into bed with diseases for which there is no cure.
[2:02:47.520 --> 2:03:03.520]  In other words, if I were the devil, I'd just keep right on doing what he's doing.
[2:03:03.520 --> 2:03:05.520]  And now I'll clip from Media Matters,
[2:03:05.520 --> 2:03:07.520]  terrify the Tucker Carlson defense-free speech.
[2:03:07.520 --> 2:03:09.520]  Here's part of that report.
[2:03:09.520 --> 2:03:12.520]  Why do we laugh at Alex Jones again since here?
[2:03:12.520 --> 2:03:17.520]  Tucker's understated for three, four years. I've been friends with Tucker for about eight, nine.
[2:03:17.520 --> 2:03:21.520]  I mean, you know, as well as I, there's nobody in the press
[2:03:21.520 --> 2:03:26.520]  who is culturally on the same page as you are, or I am, for that matter.
[2:03:26.520 --> 2:03:29.520]  Alex Jones, Alex Jones, Alex Jones,
[2:03:29.520 --> 2:03:32.520]  Tucker Carlson, Alex Jones, Alex Jones,
[2:03:32.520 --> 2:03:34.520]  Tucker Carlson, Alex Jones, Alex Jones,
[2:03:34.520 --> 2:03:35.520]  Tucker Carlson.
[2:03:35.520 --> 2:03:39.520]  For the record, we have never endorsed any kind of conspiracy theory in the show
[2:03:39.520 --> 2:03:47.520]  and never would. FBI operatives were organizing the attack on the Capitol on January 6th.
[2:03:47.520 --> 2:03:52.520]  This was a psychological warfare operation to manipulate a crowd.
[2:03:52.520 --> 2:03:54.520]  You know, that's enough. I'm not even going to play the whole thing.
[2:03:54.520 --> 2:03:57.520]  We're out of time. I'm going to play it later if we have time.
[2:03:57.520 --> 2:04:01.520]  But it's admitted the FBI was running things now. It's come out.
[2:04:01.520 --> 2:04:06.520]  So just the way they operate and the way they try to get Tucker in trouble at News Corp
[2:04:06.520 --> 2:04:09.520]  for defending me, it's not going to work.
[2:04:09.520 --> 2:04:12.520]  Tucker is the only guy there that has a contract where you can say whatever he wants.
[2:04:12.520 --> 2:04:15.520]  Just so you know. So they're totally panicked.
[2:04:15.520 --> 2:04:17.520]  They don't know what to do. All right.
[2:04:17.520 --> 2:04:23.520]  I've got the biggest news yet on the bio weapons being cooked up in labs we're going to hit.
[2:04:23.520 --> 2:04:28.520]  Then I'm going to get into the NATO information and how that's really the King Daddy operation.
[2:04:28.520 --> 2:04:31.520]  And then I've got that really key thing.
[2:04:31.520 --> 2:04:38.520]  I'm going to start beginning to talk about today the observer effect and quantum physics
[2:04:38.520 --> 2:04:41.520]  or quantum mechanics of quantum physics.
[2:04:41.520 --> 2:04:44.520]  It'll be right back.
[2:04:44.520 --> 2:04:53.520]  I am taping this update on the morning of Tuesday, October 19th, 2021 to let all of our great radio and TV
[2:04:53.520 --> 2:04:59.520]  listeners know that bodies ultimate turmeric formula that's been sold out for a long time is back in stock
[2:04:59.520 --> 2:05:01.520]  at a 5% humanoid level.

[2:05:36.520 --> 2:05:38.520]  Down and out. 50% off.

[2:06:04.520 --> 2:06:08.520]  Alright, ladies and gentlemen, we've covered a lot of global news.
[2:06:08.520 --> 2:06:15.520]  We've covered the transgender depopulation western style one-child policy program
[2:06:15.520 --> 2:06:21.520]  where we sterilize our young boys and condition them and brainwash them to accept transgenderism,
[2:06:21.520 --> 2:06:25.520]  which is again just chemical or physical mutilation and sterilization.
[2:06:25.520 --> 2:06:29.520]  That we covered a lot. We covered a lot of other big subjects,
[2:06:29.520 --> 2:06:32.520]  but right now I'm going to hit the big one.
[2:06:32.520 --> 2:06:36.520]  That yes, I've been harping on for 20 months every day on the show
[2:06:36.520 --> 2:06:39.520]  because it is the great reset. It is the takeover.
[2:06:39.520 --> 2:06:45.520]  It is their new water plan in Klaus Schwab in Bill Gates' own words.
[2:06:45.520 --> 2:06:51.520]  So I'm going to hit this right now. Huge stack here.
[2:06:51.520 --> 2:06:55.520]  And they're all ties together. I hope you take notes and hope you listen to me very, very carefully
[2:06:55.520 --> 2:06:59.520]  because this is a life and death situation.
[2:06:59.520 --> 2:07:03.520]  We know that Fauci works for the depopulation as eugenicists.
[2:07:03.520 --> 2:07:09.520]  They cooked up COVID-19 as a bio weapon out of five viruses that they would own,
[2:07:09.520 --> 2:07:14.520]  that they could control, so they could then release more deadly variants whenever they wanted,
[2:07:14.520 --> 2:07:17.520]  claiming that they were just variants of COVID-19.
[2:07:17.520 --> 2:07:25.520]  They produced synthetic nanotech viruses that would show up in a testing machine as COVID-19,
[2:07:25.520 --> 2:07:32.520]  and they really just wanted the COVID-19 cover story to be able to release nanotech viruses
[2:07:32.520 --> 2:07:35.520]  that have a half-life that only replicates so long
[2:07:35.520 --> 2:07:39.520]  so that the globalists can bomb certain areas or certain places,
[2:07:39.520 --> 2:07:44.520]  like the chemical or biological version of a neutron bomb.
[2:07:44.520 --> 2:07:47.520]  And if you don't know what that is, look it up, you'll understand.
[2:07:47.520 --> 2:07:50.520]  A neutron bomb kills all the life that leaves the infrastructure in place
[2:07:50.520 --> 2:07:55.520]  and doesn't destroy the buildings, and the radiation is gone in just a few minutes,
[2:07:55.520 --> 2:07:58.520]  and then you can just come in and replant and regrow.
[2:07:58.520 --> 2:08:02.520]  And most of the nuclear weapons are neutron, that's the whole globalist plan.
[2:08:02.520 --> 2:08:07.520]  One plan is to neutron bomb the surface of the main cities and depopulate us that way,
[2:08:07.520 --> 2:08:09.520]  and they just neutron us at any point.
[2:08:09.520 --> 2:08:16.520]  I know in the 80s they put neutron bombs up in orbit, so just remember that.
[2:08:16.520 --> 2:08:20.520]  And once they get their people in full control of the Pentagon, which they've almost got,
[2:08:20.520 --> 2:08:22.520]  they may just go ahead and neutron all of us.
[2:08:22.520 --> 2:08:24.520]  But God's in control, we'll see if God's stopped that.
[2:08:24.520 --> 2:08:26.520]  That's just side issue.
[2:08:26.520 --> 2:08:28.520]  I need to get off the neutron bombs for you.
[2:08:28.520 --> 2:08:35.520]  This is the equivalent of a neutron biological weapon, where it's synthetic and it has a half-life,
[2:08:35.520 --> 2:08:40.520]  and it infects normally only one or two people after that.
[2:08:40.520 --> 2:08:46.520]  And I was told that by a lot of people actually in U.S. intelligence from the highest levels last year,
[2:08:46.520 --> 2:08:52.520]  they said, no, they're going to release synthetics and it can only infect a few people after
[2:08:52.520 --> 2:08:56.520]  and then it basically is designed in its replication to phase out.
[2:08:56.520 --> 2:09:00.520]  And then I haven't seen it yet, but I've talked to friends and others that have sent the new James Bond movie
[2:09:00.520 --> 2:09:03.520]  that they held up for a year because it was, quote, too close to the real pandemic.
[2:09:03.520 --> 2:09:09.520]  And in that, there's a bio-weapon that's ray-specific that only kills who it targets
[2:09:09.520 --> 2:09:13.520]  unless you're one or two people down in the chain.
[2:09:13.520 --> 2:09:19.520]  While you're infected dying, it can slough off and kill you as well, which is actually what it does.
[2:09:19.520 --> 2:09:24.520]  So they just, again, they love, they go watch the movies and just enjoy it
[2:09:24.520 --> 2:09:26.520]  and how they're killing you and how they told you they killed you
[2:09:26.520 --> 2:09:32.520]  because you're supposed to publish a notice under universal law that you're going to kill somebody when you do it.
[2:09:32.520 --> 2:09:36.520]  Just like when you're going to destroy a building or take a piece of property by adverse possession
[2:09:36.520 --> 2:09:40.520]  that nobody's been claiming or paying taxes on, you've got to post it.
[2:09:40.520 --> 2:09:43.520]  And so I haven't seen it yet. I'm going to try to go see it in the next few days.
[2:09:43.520 --> 2:09:47.520]  The new Brainwashing James Bond movie, not because it's entertaining or good,
[2:09:47.520 --> 2:09:49.520]  but because I want to be able to analyze it, but I'm told that's what's in it.
[2:09:49.520 --> 2:09:52.520]  And so I told you about it a long time ago, others told you about it, and now it's here,
[2:09:52.520 --> 2:09:56.520]  and now it's confirmed, but it's in a movie, so it's, oh, you got that from the movie.
[2:09:56.520 --> 2:09:57.520]  Yeah, right.
[2:09:57.520 --> 2:10:01.520]  So let's go ahead and just give you some background here on the new thing, though.
[2:10:01.520 --> 2:10:08.520]  Remember we made a big deal about this last year that in the year before that in 2019,
[2:10:08.520 --> 2:10:12.520]  a bunch of people working for Bill Gates, Peter Dazik, and others,
[2:10:12.520 --> 2:10:14.520]  they don't work for the U.S. government, they don't work for the Canadian government,
[2:10:14.520 --> 2:10:16.520]  they don't work for the Chinese government.
[2:10:16.520 --> 2:10:19.520]  It's being honest, I hate the Chinese government, I hate communism,
[2:10:19.520 --> 2:10:23.520]  but as best we know, they're triple agents, like Specter in a James Bond movie,
[2:10:23.520 --> 2:10:26.520]  they're a global corporate group above it all that plays the cutaries off against each other.
[2:10:26.520 --> 2:10:29.520]  But they've got operatives in every government as well,
[2:10:29.520 --> 2:10:31.520]  so they're telling you how the globalist Bilderberg group works,
[2:10:31.520 --> 2:10:32.520]  Ian Fleming told you.
[2:10:32.520 --> 2:10:35.520]  The head of the Bilderberg group is now the head of the Davos group.
[2:10:35.520 --> 2:10:38.520]  Like, Cobra Commander goes behind the bushes at his meeting with a mask on,
[2:10:38.520 --> 2:10:41.520]  then he comes out as Klaus Schwab during the day, that's the allegory.
[2:10:41.520 --> 2:10:45.520]  I'm not literally saying Klaus Schwab's Cobra Commander, he's far worse because he's real.
[2:10:45.520 --> 2:10:47.520]  Children.
[2:10:47.520 --> 2:10:48.520]  So, let's continue.
[2:10:48.520 --> 2:10:50.520]  But they tell you in all the literature and culture how it works.
[2:10:50.520 --> 2:11:01.520]  So, uninhabitable hell, climate change and disease threatens millions U.N. warrants.
[2:11:01.520 --> 2:11:07.520]  And it says right here that, oh my God, this is like 2019,
[2:11:07.520 --> 2:11:13.520]  we're all going to be dead soon, super viruses will emerge because it's going to get too hot.
[2:11:13.520 --> 2:11:15.520]  This is from Reuters.
[2:11:15.520 --> 2:11:18.520]  So, when things emerge, oh, it's your fault, it's global war.
[2:11:18.520 --> 2:11:19.520]  I remember they told you that last year.
[2:11:19.520 --> 2:11:20.520]  Worse is yet to come.
[2:11:20.520 --> 2:11:21.520]  Disaster is future ahead.
[2:11:21.520 --> 2:11:25.520]  For millions worldwide due to climate change reports, it says U.S. aid a day.
[2:11:25.520 --> 2:11:28.520]  And it says the same thing, that hot weather is going to cause super viruses.
[2:11:28.520 --> 2:11:35.520]  And life on earth will not be able to recover and it's going to be unlivable and you're all going to die.
[2:11:35.520 --> 2:11:39.520]  So, when they hit you with a bio weapon and they tell you it naturally came out of a cave in China
[2:11:39.520 --> 2:11:41.520]  or a wet market, you believe it.
[2:11:41.520 --> 2:11:43.520]  They're all pre-programming you.
[2:11:43.520 --> 2:11:46.520]  When the bio weapon comes, it was because you were bad.
[2:11:46.520 --> 2:11:47.520]  When you died, it's because you were bad.
[2:11:47.520 --> 2:11:48.520]  Okay, good.
[2:11:48.520 --> 2:11:49.520]  Okay, thank you.
[2:11:49.520 --> 2:11:51.520]  By the way, here's your new admiral.
[2:11:51.520 --> 2:11:53.520]  He's a transgender.
[2:11:53.520 --> 2:11:58.520]  Okay, so it says cardiovascular and respiratory diseases will come from the heat.
[2:11:58.520 --> 2:12:01.520]  So, a respiratory disease is going to kill you from the heat.
[2:12:01.520 --> 2:12:04.520]  It says right there, from the heat.
[2:12:04.520 --> 2:12:10.520]  Leaked U.N. draft report, warrants of accelerating climate devastation.
[2:12:10.520 --> 2:12:13.520]  Oh, but it wasn't out of a cave.
[2:12:13.520 --> 2:12:15.520]  It wasn't out of the jungles of Africa.
[2:12:15.520 --> 2:12:17.520]  It was London Telegraph.
[2:12:17.520 --> 2:12:24.520]  Wuhan scientists plan to release coronavirus particles into KBAT's leaked papers reveal.
[2:12:24.520 --> 2:12:34.520]  Oh, and they planned to spray it in nanoparticles of synthetic viral delivery system of chimeric COVID spike proteins
[2:12:34.520 --> 2:12:39.520]  using skin penetrating nanoparticles that also then replicate the body.
[2:12:39.520 --> 2:12:44.520]  The story of the scientist said it'll only replicate a few times so it won't spread to humans.
[2:12:44.520 --> 2:12:47.520]  Just like the real stuff they're spraying us with right now.
[2:12:47.520 --> 2:12:49.520]  Oh, and then there's a bunch of articles about the backgrounds.
[2:12:49.520 --> 2:12:55.520]  Gads that convinced Fauci funded Chinese coronavirus research conference featuring Hunter Biden leaked pandemic group.
[2:12:55.520 --> 2:12:56.520]  It goes on.
[2:12:56.520 --> 2:12:57.520]  So, there's the background.
[2:12:57.520 --> 2:12:59.520]  Now, let me give you the new information.
[2:12:59.520 --> 2:13:04.520]  You just always want to back things up, though, for you so that you understand what's going on here.
[2:13:04.520 --> 2:13:05.520]  And you can look it up for yourself.
[2:13:05.520 --> 2:13:07.520]  Here's the new news.
[2:13:07.520 --> 2:13:09.520]  Let's get the new news. Let's go back a few years.
[2:13:09.520 --> 2:13:16.520]  As I said, in 2019, when they were getting all this cooked up and ready and creating plausible liability.
[2:13:16.520 --> 2:13:18.520]  And the experts have come out.
[2:13:18.520 --> 2:13:19.520]  The people involved.
[2:13:19.520 --> 2:13:21.520]  This is all the news.
[2:13:21.520 --> 2:13:27.520]  A group of Chinese government connected, Peter Dazik connected, Bill Gates connected, Fauci connected.
[2:13:27.520 --> 2:13:30.520]  Scientists snuck out of the lab.
[2:13:30.520 --> 2:13:38.520]  They call that steel out of the lab in Canada, a virus that at that time killed 40% of humans that got it.
[2:13:38.520 --> 2:13:42.520]  But now they've souped it up at Wuhan to kill 80% and they're now admitting that.
[2:13:42.520 --> 2:13:47.520]  And so Fauci says, though, something far worse is coming and he's now given you a vaccine to lower your immunity to it.
[2:13:47.520 --> 2:13:49.520]  Okay, that was three years ago.
[2:13:49.520 --> 2:13:50.520]  Two and a half years ago.
[2:13:50.520 --> 2:13:56.520]  There's no one bio warfare expert questions why Canada was sending lethal viruses to China.
[2:13:56.520 --> 2:13:59.520]  That's the Edmonton Journal.
[2:13:59.520 --> 2:14:06.520]  World's deadliest viruses were shipped to Wuhan leak lab from Canada by rogue scientists linked to Chinese military, the sun.
[2:14:06.520 --> 2:14:11.520]  Questions around Canadian shipment of deadly viruses to China.
[2:14:11.520 --> 2:14:16.520]  Protocol ignored and pathogen transferred and weaned Ping's microbiology lab.
[2:14:16.520 --> 2:14:18.520]  Winnipeg free press.
[2:14:18.520 --> 2:14:22.520]  Canada's lab, Canada's lab shipment of Ebola.
[2:14:22.520 --> 2:14:26.520]  Hennepa viruses to China raised questions.
[2:14:26.520 --> 2:14:31.520]  The CDC, then they've got them merging them and creating them and all the rest of it here.
[2:14:31.520 --> 2:14:38.520]  Now, here's the next little juicy for you out of CTV news also out of Canada last month and they're not making a big deal about it.
[2:14:38.520 --> 2:14:54.520]  They just say suddenly the very virus shipped in 2019 to the Wuhan lab that killed 40% of people then has now for the first time popped up in India.
[2:14:54.520 --> 2:15:00.520]  And it's killing the majority of people that get it.
[2:15:00.520 --> 2:15:04.520]  Okay, they don't put two and two together here and point that out.
[2:15:04.520 --> 2:15:07.520]  So they get it, they ship it to the lab, they soup it up even more.
[2:15:07.520 --> 2:15:13.520]  It magically pops up for the first time this variety in India and it's nothing to worry about.
[2:15:13.520 --> 2:15:15.520]  Okay, what is Nipah?
[2:15:15.520 --> 2:15:18.520]  The deadly virus emerging in India alongside COVID-19.
[2:15:18.520 --> 2:15:23.520]  And it goes on to say well it used to kill 40% but now it kills 80%
[2:15:23.520 --> 2:15:29.520]  and it's now able to jump into humans because it was zoologically just magically made the leap where it can do it now.
[2:15:29.520 --> 2:15:35.520]  So, oh, that's a small part of the stack today as they gear up to murder everyone.
[2:15:35.520 --> 2:15:37.520]  But they're doing it to save the earth, right?
[2:15:37.520 --> 2:15:43.520]  We'll be right back in FullWars.com tomorrow's news today.
[2:15:43.520 --> 2:15:49.520]  Hey everybody, if you've ever thought about heirloom beans as a storable survival food, I've got great news.
[2:15:49.520 --> 2:15:52.520]  In fact, I'll bet it's the best news you've heard in a while.
[2:15:52.520 --> 2:15:58.520]  Here's the thing, we've just received a fresh batch of gourmet heirloom beans, survival soup beans.
[2:15:58.520 --> 2:16:03.520]  These beans are gorgeous, highly nutritious, and above all, with no hesitation whatsoever,
[2:16:03.520 --> 2:16:06.520]  the best tasting beans in the entire world.
[2:16:06.520 --> 2:16:07.520]  The best part?
[2:16:07.520 --> 2:16:13.520]  We've dropped the price by 33% this week for listeners who know higher food prices are coming
[2:16:13.520 --> 2:16:18.520]  and want an inflation hedge you can actually eat if you want to, gets even better.
[2:16:18.520 --> 2:16:22.520]  With your permission and with a high regard for your health and well-being,

[2:16:52.520 --> 2:16:56.520]  The globalists know their agenda is unpopular, they know you're angry,
[2:16:56.520 --> 2:17:01.520]  and now to get around big tech, it's more important than ever that we use every tool we've got.

[2:17:46.520 --> 2:17:51.520]  If you only knew the power of the dark side,
[2:17:51.520 --> 2:17:58.520]  join Bill Gates, and together we will defeat humanity.
[2:17:58.520 --> 2:18:04.520]  Then our gods will reward us with eternal life.
[2:18:04.520 --> 2:18:08.520]  That's basically the ethos of the globalists.
[2:18:08.520 --> 2:18:16.520]  They must first play God, they must first prove that they are the fittest in their social Darwinistic system.
[2:18:16.520 --> 2:18:23.520]  And in a way they're right, if we let them lie to us and dumb us down and poison us and destroy our children's futures,
[2:18:23.520 --> 2:18:29.520]  and the evidence is overwhelming and out in the open, we really deserve what's happened to us.
[2:18:29.520 --> 2:18:35.520]  So I ask you now, are you going to step up and expose the new order even more?
[2:18:35.520 --> 2:18:39.520]  I know I'm pledging to step up and redouble my efforts.
[2:18:39.520 --> 2:18:43.520]  The front lines of the fight is infowars.gov.
[2:18:43.520 --> 2:18:47.520]  The average person on the face of this incredible planet is still unaware
[2:18:47.520 --> 2:18:52.520]  that there's a war between three individuals and nation states on one side
[2:18:52.520 --> 2:18:57.520]  and the globalists on the other who are literally trying to create a post-human world.
[2:18:57.520 --> 2:19:01.520]  From the United States to Brazil, and of course triggered by the Brexit in the UK,
[2:19:01.520 --> 2:19:05.520]  nations were pulling out of the private corporate fascist world government.
[2:19:05.520 --> 2:19:07.520]  That's why they launched their great recess.
[2:19:07.520 --> 2:19:12.520]  And they're programing after collapsing us of Build Back Better.
[2:19:12.520 --> 2:19:18.520]  This is nothing more than a top-down vertical consolidation of the world economy.
[2:19:18.520 --> 2:19:21.520]  And because they couldn't take our guns, and because we wouldn't bow,
[2:19:21.520 --> 2:19:27.520]  because the left, which is the ideology of this world government system, couldn't win,
[2:19:27.520 --> 2:19:29.520]  they released a biological weapon on us.
[2:19:29.520 --> 2:19:33.520]  Now we know, two years ago, we learned about it about 20 months ago.
[2:19:33.520 --> 2:19:34.520]  It's that simple.
[2:19:34.520 --> 2:19:37.520]  They can't meet us because of our free speech and our guns.
[2:19:37.520 --> 2:19:41.520]  So the global corporate combine released COVID-19, and you know the rest is history.
[2:19:41.520 --> 2:19:51.520]  Expose this paradigm and we win.
[2:20:11.520 --> 2:20:19.520]  It's one of the biggest stories in the world that Alex Jones found guilty of defaming
[2:20:19.520 --> 2:20:23.520]  and purposely lying about people, like they have like something that read my mind.
[2:20:23.520 --> 2:20:30.520]  And you notice they said, now a jury will decide how much money he owes because he's guilty.
[2:20:30.520 --> 2:20:35.520]  Since when do judges say who's guilty, and then a jury decides how much money you owe?
[2:20:35.520 --> 2:20:37.520]  Well, that's really never been done before.
[2:20:37.520 --> 2:20:41.520]  The lawyers did a great job breaking this down back at the time that I wasn't aware of.
[2:20:41.520 --> 2:20:46.520]  And so we're going to play part of that coming up in the next segment.
[2:20:46.520 --> 2:20:49.520]  Now I said I was going to hit that huge news, and I am briefly,
[2:20:49.520 --> 2:20:54.520]  but you cannot do it justice without reading at all.
[2:20:54.520 --> 2:20:59.520]  And it's probably just in this little folder, probably 30 pages of stuff, 40 pages,
[2:20:59.520 --> 2:21:03.520]  that off of each little piece you can riff off of.
[2:21:03.520 --> 2:21:07.520]  But I promise you, we're going to be getting into it in great detail,
[2:21:07.520 --> 2:21:11.520]  because it's very, very positive, but also very, very scary information.
[2:21:11.520 --> 2:21:15.520]  I also have this big NATO information that is so important that people really aren't aware of.
[2:21:15.520 --> 2:21:17.520]  And so we've already covered that some the last few days,
[2:21:17.520 --> 2:21:19.520]  but I'll be getting more into that.
[2:21:19.520 --> 2:21:22.520]  But let's just get back to this for a second.
[2:21:22.520 --> 2:21:28.520]  I showed you mainstream news, government documents, admissions that Fauci through Peter Dazik
[2:21:28.520 --> 2:21:33.520]  and Bill Gates Money didn't just create COVID-19 and said they were going to release an open air
[2:21:33.520 --> 2:21:38.520]  and create nanoparticles that replicate in piercer skin.
[2:21:38.520 --> 2:21:41.520]  They didn't just power grab and censor people that exposed it.
[2:21:41.520 --> 2:21:44.520]  They didn't just block therapeutics that would protect people.
[2:21:44.520 --> 2:21:48.520]  They didn't just bring in a world government, a world ID under it.
[2:21:48.520 --> 2:21:54.520]  But then we learned, got hundreds of other super deadly viruses, far worse,
[2:21:54.520 --> 2:21:58.520]  but still they're souping them up at the Wuhan lab.
[2:21:58.520 --> 2:22:00.520]  And I guess they'll release another one.
[2:22:00.520 --> 2:22:03.520]  And then there'll also be the spokespersons that tell us they're in charge
[2:22:03.520 --> 2:22:06.520]  and tell us what to do and tell us what to put in our bodies.
[2:22:06.520 --> 2:22:10.520]  And this is so over the top, and it's meant to be over the top,
[2:22:10.520 --> 2:22:12.520]  because it's just so ridiculous what they're doing.
[2:22:12.520 --> 2:22:15.520]  People can't believe that the guy running all this quarterback,
[2:22:15.520 --> 2:22:17.520]  producing it and releasing it.
[2:22:17.520 --> 2:22:19.520]  And then they had it stolen out of the lab,
[2:22:19.520 --> 2:22:21.520]  which they shouldn't be making up in Canada.
[2:22:21.520 --> 2:22:24.520]  And Justin Trudeau, who's totally a Chinese communist agent
[2:22:24.520 --> 2:22:26.520]  and says he wants to set up a dictatorship in Canada,
[2:22:26.520 --> 2:22:27.520]  modeled that for Xi Jinping.
[2:22:27.520 --> 2:22:29.520]  I mean, that happened.
[2:22:29.520 --> 2:22:32.520]  And then lo and behold, he's got Chinese troops training up there
[2:22:32.520 --> 2:22:34.520]  and has the military spying on the citizens,
[2:22:34.520 --> 2:22:36.520]  and the head general goes public and they fire him.
[2:22:36.520 --> 2:22:39.520]  I mean, this is crazy.
[2:22:39.520 --> 2:22:41.520]  Well, if they did that, people blow the whistle.
[2:22:41.520 --> 2:22:42.520]  They do.
[2:22:42.520 --> 2:22:43.520]  And they fire them.
[2:22:43.520 --> 2:22:47.520]  And then they put in some, you know, woman in a four-star general outfit.
[2:22:47.520 --> 2:22:48.520]  That's what they do.
[2:22:48.520 --> 2:22:51.520]  And milly up there saying, our military is racist and evil.
[2:22:51.520 --> 2:22:53.520]  White people are inherently bad.
[2:22:53.520 --> 2:22:55.520]  I mean, this is a takeover.
[2:22:55.520 --> 2:22:57.520]  They don't say we're global.
[2:22:57.520 --> 2:22:58.520]  It certainly populates you.
[2:22:58.520 --> 2:22:59.520]  I mean, they do say that.
[2:22:59.520 --> 2:23:00.520]  But to the general public, it's your race.
[2:23:00.520 --> 2:23:01.520]  It's your bad.
[2:23:01.520 --> 2:23:02.520]  America's evil.
[2:23:02.520 --> 2:23:03.520]  Yeah, we're flying in.
[2:23:03.520 --> 2:23:04.520]  Hundreds of thousands of kids are disappearing.
[2:23:04.520 --> 2:23:05.520]  No big deal.
[2:23:05.520 --> 2:23:06.520]  Just to shut up.
[2:23:06.520 --> 2:23:10.520]  Look, four-star admiral is a woman.
[2:23:10.520 --> 2:23:11.520]  Aren't you excited?
[2:23:11.520 --> 2:23:13.520]  And it's a man.
[2:23:13.520 --> 2:23:16.520]  So this is just mass behavioral psychology,
[2:23:16.520 --> 2:23:19.520]  confusing and scrambling and just smoke screening
[2:23:19.520 --> 2:23:21.520]  and befuddling everybody.
[2:23:21.520 --> 2:23:24.520]  It's called the fog of war.
[2:23:24.520 --> 2:23:28.520]  So it's totally illegal and evil for Canada to be making this stuff
[2:23:28.520 --> 2:23:30.520]  and claiming, oh, because they want to be able to counter it.
[2:23:30.520 --> 2:23:33.520]  But then to create new viruses and splice them with it
[2:23:33.520 --> 2:23:36.520]  so it can jump into humans and then send it to Wuhan
[2:23:36.520 --> 2:23:38.520]  so they can release it on the world and then say,
[2:23:38.520 --> 2:23:40.520]  oh, was it America?
[2:23:40.520 --> 2:23:41.520]  Was it Canada?
[2:23:41.520 --> 2:23:42.520]  Was it China?
[2:23:42.520 --> 2:23:44.520]  Was it the UN?
[2:23:44.520 --> 2:23:45.520]  Was it Bill Gates?
[2:23:45.520 --> 2:23:47.520]  That's who it was.
[2:23:47.520 --> 2:23:50.520]  So we're living in a biological weapon attack.
[2:23:50.520 --> 2:23:53.520]  And I've got like writers calling me in national news all the time.
[2:23:53.520 --> 2:23:54.520]  Oh, do a big interview.
[2:23:54.520 --> 2:23:57.520]  Oh, do a big biopic on you.
[2:23:57.520 --> 2:23:58.520]  Do a movie on you.
[2:23:58.520 --> 2:24:01.520]  And I'm just like, that is none of that's even going to exist.
[2:24:01.520 --> 2:24:04.520]  Do you understand they did a test weapon with something
[2:24:04.520 --> 2:24:07.520]  that kills old people and people that are already sick
[2:24:07.520 --> 2:24:08.520]  to see how you respond?
[2:24:08.520 --> 2:24:11.520]  Did they release something a little more worse?
[2:24:11.520 --> 2:24:12.520]  Just as I predicted they would.
[2:24:12.520 --> 2:24:14.520]  Because they want to control things.
[2:24:14.520 --> 2:24:16.520]  They don't want to release really bad stuff up front.
[2:24:16.520 --> 2:24:18.520]  And now they're telling you, OK, something far worse is coming.
[2:24:18.520 --> 2:24:19.520]  Get ready.
[2:24:19.520 --> 2:24:21.520]  Go in your houses and lock up when it happens.
[2:24:21.520 --> 2:24:23.520]  They're just going to fly over with drones
[2:24:23.520 --> 2:24:24.520]  and spray it on your house.
[2:24:24.520 --> 2:24:25.520]  You're going to die.
[2:24:25.520 --> 2:24:28.520]  So, I mean, I'm sitting here looking at the clock going, man.
[2:24:28.520 --> 2:24:29.520]  I'm winding up on this.
[2:24:29.520 --> 2:24:32.520]  I really ought to get to some middle of the nowhere log cabin
[2:24:32.520 --> 2:24:33.520]  100 miles from anywhere.
[2:24:33.520 --> 2:24:36.520]  If I was a selfish person, I would look at my four-year-old daughter,
[2:24:36.520 --> 2:24:38.520]  so beautiful and good this morning, so full of God's light.
[2:24:38.520 --> 2:24:41.520]  And I'm just thinking, man, should I just pull up?
[2:24:41.520 --> 2:24:43.520]  I should get the hell out of here right now.
[2:24:43.520 --> 2:24:45.520]  Just to, you know, the public, they're not going to listen.
[2:24:45.520 --> 2:24:47.520]  They're just going to have to get exterminated.
[2:24:47.520 --> 2:24:49.520]  And I don't want to die with them.
[2:24:49.520 --> 2:24:51.520]  And, believe me, all the people I know already left,
[2:24:51.520 --> 2:24:53.520]  all the smart money already split.
[2:24:53.520 --> 2:24:57.520]  I mean, it's America and Australia and New Zealand and Canada and the UK.
[2:24:57.520 --> 2:25:00.520]  We're marked for death because of the Christian ethos
[2:25:00.520 --> 2:25:04.520]  and our background and our historical opposition to the New World Order.
[2:25:04.520 --> 2:25:06.520]  They took this over because of our power to take over the world.
[2:25:06.520 --> 2:25:09.520]  Now they want to get rid of who helped them take over the world.
[2:25:09.520 --> 2:25:13.520]  So, and they're telling you that, you know, the cataclysm's here.
[2:25:13.520 --> 2:25:16.520]  The end of the world's here. They mean the end of the world for us.
[2:25:16.520 --> 2:25:19.520]  And so it's just, it's ridiculous.
[2:25:19.520 --> 2:25:22.520]  It's absolutely ridiculous to see judges, you know, out there attacking us
[2:25:22.520 --> 2:25:25.520]  and taking away our due process and doing North Korea stuff.
[2:25:25.520 --> 2:25:26.520]  People are, aren't you upset about that?
[2:25:26.520 --> 2:25:28.520]  I'm like, that doesn't even matter.
[2:25:28.520 --> 2:25:30.520]  Do you understand that?
[2:25:30.520 --> 2:25:32.520]  They have produced a virus that kills 80% of people,
[2:25:32.520 --> 2:25:36.520]  and they admit they've got it, and it's in mainstream news that Fauci got it,
[2:25:36.520 --> 2:25:37.520]  and has it the damn lab.
[2:25:37.520 --> 2:25:38.520]  He's holding his hostage.
[2:25:38.520 --> 2:25:41.520]  Do you understand that?
[2:25:41.520 --> 2:25:47.520]  And all your race politics and all your political crap doesn't matter anymore.
[2:25:47.520 --> 2:25:52.520]  If we don't get a major awakening in the intelligence agencies
[2:25:52.520 --> 2:25:55.520]  and in governments and in corporations to put the brakes on this, it's over.
[2:25:55.520 --> 2:25:57.520]  I saw John Stuart was on TV this weekend.
[2:25:57.520 --> 2:25:59.520]  I'm seeing him going, let's stop fighting left and right.
[2:25:59.520 --> 2:26:01.520]  Listen, Trump's not really that bad.
[2:26:01.520 --> 2:26:03.520]  We need to stop all the censorship.
[2:26:03.520 --> 2:26:05.520]  This is really bad. You need to stop.
[2:26:05.520 --> 2:26:09.520]  And they're not listening, folks, because they're going full bore.
[2:26:09.520 --> 2:26:12.520]  And everybody that isn't totally satanic on the other side is like,
[2:26:12.520 --> 2:26:15.520]  well, we wanted to run things, but not do this.
[2:26:15.520 --> 2:26:16.520]  What's going on?
[2:26:16.520 --> 2:26:20.520]  Well, I mean, you know, John Stuart's brother runs the New York Stock Exchange heavily hooked up.
[2:26:20.520 --> 2:26:21.520]  He knows.
[2:26:21.520 --> 2:26:24.520]  And he looks scared, folks, and you should be.
[2:26:24.520 --> 2:26:27.520]  People should be really scared, because the globalists know about
[2:26:27.520 --> 2:26:31.520]  intention and focus and will and the power of humans to change the universe around us.
[2:26:31.520 --> 2:26:35.520]  That is observer effect quantum physics proven.
[2:26:35.520 --> 2:26:39.520]  And they had that power and they know if you believe in that power and connect to God
[2:26:39.520 --> 2:26:43.520]  and then have God's will that you can literally move mountains.
[2:26:43.520 --> 2:26:46.520]  Not some magic trick, not some Jedi thing.
[2:26:46.520 --> 2:26:49.520]  Luke Skywalker, you know, picking up rocks with Yoda.
[2:26:49.520 --> 2:26:54.520]  I mean, change the universe the way energy interacts with other humans and other systems
[2:26:54.520 --> 2:26:57.520]  with positive wavelengths and destructive wavelengths.
[2:26:57.520 --> 2:27:02.520]  Lower energy that's coming in from the first and second dimensions,
[2:27:02.520 --> 2:27:07.520]  that simple way of thinking human that tends to be very destructive and hateful.
[2:27:07.520 --> 2:27:09.520]  They try to harness that and control it, but you can't.
[2:27:09.520 --> 2:27:14.520]  And then higher energy waves that are fueling the third dimension.
[2:27:14.520 --> 2:27:18.520]  It's like a Roman arch where there's no cement between the big blocks,
[2:27:18.520 --> 2:27:24.520]  but they perfectly weigh together and then come together with the keystone right in the metal.
[2:27:24.520 --> 2:27:30.520]  That's how the dimensions hold each other together like a Roman arch.
[2:27:30.520 --> 2:27:33.520]  That's a simple three-dimensional rendering it for you.
[2:27:33.520 --> 2:27:38.520]  And there's charges coming down in it and charges coming up into it.
[2:27:38.520 --> 2:27:40.520]  And they don't even really say that in their literature,
[2:27:40.520 --> 2:27:43.520]  but you get deeper into the quantum mechanics and the rest of it and they know that.
[2:27:43.520 --> 2:27:47.520]  And it's what the alchemists knew inherently as primitive humans,
[2:27:47.520 --> 2:27:50.520]  but they could express it but didn't understand it all.
[2:27:50.520 --> 2:27:55.520]  They got devices that can read it and the Hadron superconducting supercollider and more.
[2:27:55.520 --> 2:27:59.520]  And they are using our power to tell us, you're ugly, you're bad, the end of the world's coming,
[2:27:59.520 --> 2:28:03.520]  giant cataclysm, you need to die, 2030, everyone's going to die.
[2:28:03.520 --> 2:28:04.520]  They mean us.
[2:28:04.520 --> 2:28:08.520]  And they're out there singing, William Shatner, AOC, Beto O'Rourke,
[2:28:08.520 --> 2:28:10.520]  and they're kind of the outside, they get taken to meetings and told,
[2:28:10.520 --> 2:28:14.520]  oh, the pole chef's going to do it, oh, the virus is out of the jungle are going to do it.
[2:28:14.520 --> 2:28:16.520]  And so they've not been given the full thing.
[2:28:16.520 --> 2:28:18.520]  They're just scared going, everybody's going to die, I'm so sad,
[2:28:18.520 --> 2:28:20.520]  William, you're all going to die, I'm so sad for you.
[2:28:20.520 --> 2:28:22.520]  They don't have the full story.
[2:28:24.520 --> 2:28:25.520]  So, I mean, it's here.
[2:28:25.520 --> 2:28:26.520]  It's here.
[2:28:26.520 --> 2:28:28.520]  I mean, just, they have initiated this.
[2:28:28.520 --> 2:28:29.520]  I hope we can stop it.
[2:28:29.520 --> 2:28:30.520]  I hope we can back them down.
[2:28:30.520 --> 2:28:34.520]  I hope we get a reprieve like Nenema, but who knows, folks?
[2:28:34.520 --> 2:28:35.520]  Who knows?
[2:28:35.520 --> 2:28:36.520]  All right, more, more coming up.
[2:28:36.520 --> 2:28:37.520]  Stay with us.
[2:28:43.520 --> 2:28:47.520]  If you're concerned about the power grid and want to generate your own supply of off-grid electricity,
[2:28:47.520 --> 2:28:51.520]  this will be the most important message you'll hear this year.
[2:28:51.520 --> 2:28:52.520]  Here's why.
[2:28:52.520 --> 2:28:56.520]  We now have a small number of solar generators back in stock.
[2:28:56.520 --> 2:29:01.520]  These emergency backup systems provide life-saving backup power when you need it most.
[2:29:01.520 --> 2:29:06.520]  And unlike gas generators, solar generators run quietly, emit no dangerous fumes,
[2:29:06.520 --> 2:29:10.520]  and produce an endless supply of free electricity from the sun.
[2:29:10.520 --> 2:29:13.520]  Whether it's wildfires, dangerous weather, power grid issues,
[2:29:13.520 --> 2:29:19.520]  or just getting off the grid, you'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again.
[2:29:19.520 --> 2:29:25.520]  Even better, all this week, radio listeners get over $700 in free off-the-grid bonuses, too.
[2:29:25.520 --> 2:29:29.520]  Go to mysolarbackup.com to learn more and check availability.
[2:29:29.520 --> 2:29:31.520]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[2:29:31.520 --> 2:29:33.520]  Look for the free report, Crisis Cooling,
[2:29:33.520 --> 2:29:39.520]  how to make absolutely sure your meat, milk, and medicines stay safe and cool in any power outage.
[2:29:39.520 --> 2:29:43.520]  Yours free at mysolarbackup.com.
[2:30:09.520 --> 2:30:13.520]  This is the Liquid Tincture, and I think this is probably the most powerful one.
[2:30:13.520 --> 2:30:15.520]  Survival Shield X2, nascent iodine.
[2:30:15.520 --> 2:30:18.520]  This is, if you haven't done an iodine challenge yet,
[2:30:18.520 --> 2:30:22.520]  if you haven't done the iodine challenge, what are you waiting for now is the time.
[2:30:22.520 --> 2:30:29.520]  Supermale and superfemale vitality, Living Defense Plus and the Organic Greens Fiber Caps.
[2:30:29.520 --> 2:30:34.520]  We have a limited supply of these right now, but we want to sell them all out so we can order a new batch.
[2:30:34.520 --> 2:30:37.520]  It was very popular, the Organic Greens Fiber Caps.
[2:30:37.520 --> 2:30:41.520]  We have all kinds of other great supplements that are great for so many different things.
[2:30:41.520 --> 2:31:10.520]  Take advantage of those.
[2:31:12.520 --> 2:31:17.520]  In the past, they created thousands of trillions so that they could leverage that manipulate markets,
[2:31:17.520 --> 2:31:23.520]  but they never allowed that money to get into the general circulation or it would cause massive inflation.
[2:31:23.520 --> 2:31:27.520]  Now they've gone ahead and weaponized it and are flooding every sector of the world economy,
[2:31:27.520 --> 2:31:31.520]  buying up everything, not to have the companies operate,
[2:31:31.520 --> 2:31:35.520]  but to actually shut them down and force a collapse of civilization,
[2:31:35.520 --> 2:31:39.520]  making the companies they do fund be the only things left standing.
[2:31:39.520 --> 2:31:41.520]  This is the Great Reset. This is what's happening now.
[2:31:41.520 --> 2:32:10.520]  Warn everyone. It's the only way to stop it.
[2:32:12.520 --> 2:32:16.520]  Our leading competitor has a 75% humanoid level.
[2:32:16.520 --> 2:32:19.520]  This is a special proprietary concentrate.
[2:32:19.520 --> 2:32:22.520]  It is so good for information for your immune system.
[2:32:22.520 --> 2:32:24.520]  It's an antioxidant for your whole body.
[2:32:24.520 --> 2:32:27.520]  It's documented. It's amazing.
[2:32:27.520 --> 2:32:30.520]  Everybody knows that turmeric is an incredible thing that God created
[2:32:30.520 --> 2:32:32.520]  and bodies is the strongest and best.
[2:32:32.520 --> 2:32:36.520]  You're going to find and it's back on stock and it funds the info war.
[2:32:36.520 --> 2:32:41.520]  40% off for a limited time that goes back to regular price right now.
[2:32:41.520 --> 2:33:06.520]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:33:06.520 --> 2:33:11.520]  You are listening to an infowars.com frontline report.
[2:33:11.520 --> 2:33:17.520]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[2:33:17.520 --> 2:33:19.520]  All right. I'm going to cover this story.
[2:33:19.520 --> 2:33:21.520]  So not because I'm right in the middle of it,
[2:33:21.520 --> 2:33:24.520]  but because I don't think some of the public realizes how bad this is,
[2:33:24.520 --> 2:33:26.520]  how unusual this is,
[2:33:26.520 --> 2:33:31.520]  but how it's becoming very common in blue cities and blue states.
[2:33:31.520 --> 2:33:33.520]  People ask, why do you live in Austin, Texas,
[2:33:33.520 --> 2:33:36.520]  when it's basically the dumping ground of people
[2:33:36.520 --> 2:33:38.520]  that are leaving collapsed California?
[2:33:38.520 --> 2:33:40.520]  And it's because my mother's from here
[2:33:40.520 --> 2:33:44.520]  and my ancestors going back to the 1820s on her side
[2:33:44.520 --> 2:33:47.520]  and the 1820s on my dad's side are from Texas.
[2:33:47.520 --> 2:33:51.520]  And on both sides of the family, we're founding members of the state.
[2:33:51.520 --> 2:33:53.520]  On my mom's side, it's ridiculous.
[2:33:53.520 --> 2:33:56.520]  Like people that actually had the plan with Jackson behind the scenes,
[2:33:56.520 --> 2:33:57.520]  you know, the whole deal.
[2:33:57.520 --> 2:34:00.520]  So it's where I live. It's been conquered.
[2:34:00.520 --> 2:34:05.520]  It's been captured. And many of the judges are complete political operatives
[2:34:05.520 --> 2:34:09.520]  and do things like indict Rick Perry criminally for vetoing a bill.
[2:34:09.520 --> 2:34:11.520]  And that's totally constitutional.
[2:34:11.520 --> 2:34:14.520]  But they still tried to have a court and have a jury and put him in prison.
[2:34:14.520 --> 2:34:16.520]  And he had to spend $2 million to beat it.
[2:34:16.520 --> 2:34:21.520]  So in my view, this is real criminal activity.
[2:34:21.520 --> 2:34:26.520]  And it's the judicial system weaponized stalking Texans.
[2:34:26.520 --> 2:34:31.520]  It's like Austin's like a leftist mothership or a cancer right here
[2:34:31.520 --> 2:34:33.520]  in the middle of the city attacking everybody.
[2:34:33.520 --> 2:34:39.520]  And so folks need to understand, I don't get a trial to say I'm innocent or guilty with a jury.
[2:34:39.520 --> 2:34:44.520]  The judge says I'm guilty, says I gave them no information, which is totally not true.
[2:34:44.520 --> 2:34:50.520]  And Barnes points out we scanned through millions of documents.
[2:34:50.520 --> 2:34:53.520]  We gave them hundreds of thousands total in Connecticut and Texas.
[2:34:53.520 --> 2:34:54.520]  Depositions, everything.
[2:34:54.520 --> 2:34:57.520]  I've never been allowed to depose or even have one document in Texas.
[2:34:57.520 --> 2:34:59.520]  We asked for that and she said you're defaulted.
[2:34:59.520 --> 2:35:02.520]  And she was a new judge, another judge handed it over after COVID.
[2:35:02.520 --> 2:35:07.520]  So think of the magnitude of that where I've never gotten one document,
[2:35:07.520 --> 2:35:08.520]  never had a chance to depose anybody.
[2:35:08.520 --> 2:35:12.520]  She says you don't, but she's got me in depositions again in a couple of weeks.
[2:35:12.520 --> 2:35:15.520]  She's like, oh, but the depositions continue, but you never gave us anything.
[2:35:15.520 --> 2:35:18.520]  So I mean, this is beyond a kangaroo court, beyond a kangaroo trial,
[2:35:18.520 --> 2:35:20.520]  because at least there they have kangaroos.
[2:35:20.520 --> 2:35:22.520]  This is no judge or trial at all.
[2:35:22.520 --> 2:35:24.520]  So here it is.
[2:35:24.520 --> 2:35:28.520]  All right, let's go on to the one that is also equally interesting.
[2:35:28.520 --> 2:35:32.520]  Alex Jones is, you'll tell me if I'm wrong, Robert.
[2:35:32.520 --> 2:35:36.520]  Did he not just get screwed royally and but how?
[2:35:36.520 --> 2:35:41.520]  So, I mean, there's a lot of Alex Jones defamation lawsuits in different jurisdictions,
[2:35:41.520 --> 2:35:46.520]  but the bottom line, I think this is in Texas, this was in Texas, right?
[2:35:46.520 --> 2:35:47.520]  Yes.
[2:35:47.520 --> 2:35:53.520]  And the judge, spoiler alert, the judge came out with a default judgment against him,
[2:35:53.520 --> 2:35:56.520]  which basically adjudicated on the merits of the defamation claim.
[2:35:56.520 --> 2:36:02.520]  Basically, Robert, unless I'm mistaken, he's guilty of defamation, default judgment.
[2:36:02.520 --> 2:36:05.520]  How you get a default judgment under these circumstances,
[2:36:05.520 --> 2:36:08.520]  you're going to elucidate me and everyone watching.
[2:36:08.520 --> 2:36:09.520]  He's guilty.
[2:36:09.520 --> 2:36:11.520]  Now the only question is how much?
[2:36:11.520 --> 2:36:16.520]  Yeah, I mean, because the media pretended that there had been a judgment on the merits.
[2:36:16.520 --> 2:36:23.520]  The both the plaintiff's lawyer and the court are scared of an Austin jury giving a judgment on the merits
[2:36:23.520 --> 2:36:28.520]  because they denied Alex Jones his constitutional right to a jury trial on the merits.
[2:36:28.520 --> 2:36:32.520]  What the court did, and this is what's happening in liberal jurisdictions.
[2:36:32.520 --> 2:36:36.520]  It's why I've been telling clients of mine for a decade to get out of liberal jurisdictions.
[2:36:36.520 --> 2:36:38.520]  Don't be in the Austins of the world.
[2:36:38.520 --> 2:36:39.520]  Don't be.
[2:36:39.520 --> 2:36:42.520]  And for, you know, I, you know, Michael Malice, other people moving to Austin, I get it,
[2:36:42.520 --> 2:36:46.520]  but that that that's as bad as New York legally.
[2:36:46.520 --> 2:36:48.520]  There's no difference that either politically.
[2:36:48.520 --> 2:36:54.520]  They're even more nuts because it because they are annoyed at how the state doesn't agree with them,
[2:36:54.520 --> 2:36:56.520]  the state that surrounds them.
[2:36:56.520 --> 2:36:58.520]  And so they're even more aggressive.
[2:36:58.520 --> 2:37:03.520]  So the Austin judges are increasingly openly overtly political.
[2:37:03.520 --> 2:37:08.520]  The prosecutor that got elected in Austin was backed by George Sorrell's related groups.
[2:37:08.520 --> 2:37:11.520]  I mean, that's the mindset of the political groups there in Austin.
[2:37:11.520 --> 2:37:15.520]  And they're eager to punish their political adversaries.
[2:37:15.520 --> 2:37:20.520]  And so that this is a suit that wouldn't have been brought in most places in the country.
[2:37:20.520 --> 2:37:24.520]  It would have been thrown out on First Amendment grounds in most places in the country,
[2:37:24.520 --> 2:37:26.520]  but not in Austin.
[2:37:26.520 --> 2:37:30.520]  And the bigger problem is the court of appeals in Austin is also mostly in Austin.
[2:37:30.520 --> 2:37:32.520]  So it's all Democrats.
[2:37:32.520 --> 2:37:35.520]  So you have a conservative state, but if you live in Austin,
[2:37:35.520 --> 2:37:38.520]  you have almost all liberal Democrats ruling on your cases.
[2:37:38.520 --> 2:37:44.520]  And they have proven over the past decade that they have no recognition of their limits.
[2:37:44.520 --> 2:37:48.520]  And so what happened here is here's a guy in Alex Jones and his other,
[2:37:48.520 --> 2:37:51.520]  the other defendants that are sued in for wars, et cetera,
[2:37:51.520 --> 2:37:59.520]  produced millions of pages and documents and testimony and email and videos and hours.
[2:37:59.520 --> 2:38:03.520]  I mean, you added together produced all kinds of videos, all kind of audio files,
[2:38:03.520 --> 2:38:05.520]  all kind of email files.
[2:38:05.520 --> 2:38:07.520]  They even produced the spam email.
[2:38:07.520 --> 2:38:10.520]  I mean, just email that they had just been spanned with.
[2:38:10.520 --> 2:38:12.520]  They never even read. They produced all of that.
[2:38:12.520 --> 2:38:17.520]  They sat for days and days and days of depositions.
[2:38:17.520 --> 2:38:22.520]  More invasive discovery than ever has been allowed in the history of anti-slap cases in the country.
[2:38:22.520 --> 2:38:26.520]  Then he does a second round of discovery after all of that.
[2:38:26.520 --> 2:38:32.520]  And after producing more discovery than I think any media defendant has ever produced,
[2:38:32.520 --> 2:38:39.520]  the court says, oh, that's not enough. I'm not going to let you have a jury trial judgment for the plaintiff.
[2:38:39.520 --> 2:38:42.520]  But just just just everybody appreciates this because this was your tweet.
[2:38:42.520 --> 2:38:46.520]  And then someone cheekily report that's a that's a nice way to phrase the judgment.
[2:38:46.520 --> 2:38:49.520]  This was not I'm not going to let you have a jury trial.
[2:38:49.520 --> 2:38:52.520]  This was I'm not going to let you have a trial as far as I understand it.
[2:38:52.520 --> 2:38:57.520]  They basically said no jury trial, no bench trial, no summary judgment motion, none of it.
[2:38:57.520 --> 2:39:02.520]  It says effectively you defaulted in such an egregious way on communicating answers to
[2:39:02.520 --> 2:39:06.520]  undertakings. I forget what the word is in the states that I'm basically saying you're
[2:39:06.520 --> 2:39:11.520]  guilty by your conduct in the file, not by the merits of the file.
[2:39:11.520 --> 2:39:15.520]  So we I had a file like this back in the day was a big one.
[2:39:15.520 --> 2:39:17.520]  It was a well known American guy.
[2:39:17.520 --> 2:39:21.520]  This is all public, but names are irrelevant who got a default judgment in the United States
[2:39:21.520 --> 2:39:25.520]  because apparently the conduct was so egregious in the courts that they rendered a
[2:39:25.520 --> 2:39:30.520]  several hundred million dollar judgment against the individual by default.
[2:39:30.520 --> 2:39:33.520]  No trial, no ability to defend.
[2:39:33.520 --> 2:39:36.520]  They basically said your behavior was so over the top.
[2:39:36.520 --> 2:39:38.520]  You're guilty by default.
[2:39:38.520 --> 2:39:43.520]  They took the default judgment, brought it over to Canada and then tried to seize, you know, hundreds
[2:39:43.520 --> 2:39:45.520]  of millions of dollars worth of assets.
[2:39:45.520 --> 2:39:51.520]  This is seems to what happened in this case is in the context of the procedure of the file.
[2:39:51.520 --> 2:39:55.520]  They say you defaulted or you didn't communicate answers to undertakings.
[2:39:55.520 --> 2:39:58.520]  You were jerking the court around even if it's true.
[2:39:58.520 --> 2:40:00.520]  I don't think it's true, but let's just assume it's true.
[2:40:00.520 --> 2:40:06.520]  You screwed around so badly that we're just saying you're guilty by default, guilty.
[2:40:06.520 --> 2:40:11.520]  Now let's go to the amount and you don't even get to have a substantiation of the allegations
[2:40:11.520 --> 2:40:12.520]  against you on the merits.
[2:40:12.520 --> 2:40:15.520]  It's a foregone conclusion because you behave so badly.
[2:40:15.520 --> 2:40:17.520]  That's what happened to them.
[2:40:17.520 --> 2:40:19.520]  Yeah, that's what the court ruled.
[2:40:19.520 --> 2:40:23.520]  And to give people an idea of these kind of death penalty sanctions, that's what they're known as
[2:40:23.520 --> 2:40:27.520]  because they're denying you your right to get discovery from the other side.
[2:40:27.520 --> 2:40:32.520]  They're denying you the right to summary judgment motion, which in Texas you have a right to go up
[2:40:32.520 --> 2:40:38.520]  through the appellate process before you even get to trial if it's a certain kind of electronic media
[2:40:38.520 --> 2:40:40.520]  defendant involved.
[2:40:40.520 --> 2:40:45.520]  They're denying you a right to a bench trial and denying you a right to a jury trial.
[2:40:45.520 --> 2:40:47.520]  They're denying you all of it.
[2:40:47.520 --> 2:40:50.520]  It's considered such a severe sanction.
[2:40:50.520 --> 2:40:56.520]  Courts have repeatedly said it should never really be given outside of absolutely extraordinary,
[2:40:56.520 --> 2:41:01.520]  extreme circumstances with multiple warnings to give people an example.
[2:41:01.520 --> 2:41:05.520]  The only time it's issues when someone produces no discovery ever.
[2:41:05.520 --> 2:41:07.520]  Let me stop you on there, Robert.
[2:41:07.520 --> 2:41:09.520]  I think even producing no discovery would still be contempt.
[2:41:09.520 --> 2:41:14.520]  But when there's evidence that they've destroyed documentation might be when you get it.
[2:41:14.520 --> 2:41:19.520]  You have to have multiple layers of it, even then, because typically even if they destroyed evidence,
[2:41:19.520 --> 2:41:21.520]  there's other remedies that are available.
[2:41:21.520 --> 2:41:26.520]  So if you need to produce, like in the federal system, for example, if there's been an allegation
[2:41:26.520 --> 2:41:30.520]  of destruction of evidence, you have to prove that you can't get that evidence any other way.
[2:41:30.520 --> 2:41:34.520]  You have to prove that an evidentiary inference wouldn't be favorable.
[2:41:34.520 --> 2:41:37.520]  It wouldn't be enough or other a fee or fine.
[2:41:37.520 --> 2:41:39.520]  And that's almost never the case.
[2:41:39.520 --> 2:41:44.520]  I mean, it's almost like this would be the kind of case you have a video of the incident.
[2:41:44.520 --> 2:41:46.520]  It's the only video of the incident.
[2:41:46.520 --> 2:41:48.520]  There's no other witness testimony available.
[2:41:48.520 --> 2:41:50.520]  You're ordered to produce it.
[2:41:50.520 --> 2:41:52.520]  You destroy it.
[2:41:52.520 --> 2:41:55.520]  That's the kind of thing where they consider severe sanction.
[2:41:55.520 --> 2:41:58.520]  But even there, they usually differ you in evidentiary sanction.
[2:41:58.520 --> 2:42:02.520]  They say you get to assume that whatever was on that tape was bad for the other party.
[2:42:02.520 --> 2:42:04.520]  That's the typical remedy.
[2:42:04.520 --> 2:42:09.520]  The law, because these are constitutional rights, rights to due process of law,
[2:42:09.520 --> 2:42:14.520]  rights to a trial and rights to trial by jury that are being stripped of someone,
[2:42:14.520 --> 2:42:18.520]  it can only be done under extreme and extraordinary circumstances.
[2:42:18.520 --> 2:42:21.520]  But the left doesn't recognize these rules.
[2:42:21.520 --> 2:42:22.520]  They don't care about them.
[2:42:22.520 --> 2:42:23.520]  They're like, we don't like you.
[2:42:23.520 --> 2:42:24.520]  You're Alex Jones.
[2:42:24.520 --> 2:42:25.520]  All right, we come back.
[2:42:25.520 --> 2:42:26.520]  We've got it.
[2:42:26.520 --> 2:42:27.520]  It gets even more powerful.
[2:42:27.520 --> 2:42:29.520]  But you have to understand this is a precedent for everybody.
[2:42:29.520 --> 2:42:30.520]  And he gets it now.
[2:42:30.520 --> 2:42:31.520]  They're doing it all over the country now.
[2:42:31.520 --> 2:42:34.520]  And then just saying, you're guilty.
[2:42:34.520 --> 2:42:35.520]  You owe money.
[2:42:35.520 --> 2:42:38.520]  And then lying, lying and saying we gave them no information.
[2:42:38.520 --> 2:42:39.520]  We want to have a jury trial.
[2:42:39.520 --> 2:42:43.520]  We want to show the facts because nothing they've said is true.
[2:42:43.520 --> 2:42:49.520]  The globalists are bombarding us with propaganda and with spiritual warfare
[2:42:49.520 --> 2:42:52.520]  and with poisons and chemicals added to the food.
[2:42:52.520 --> 2:42:53.520]  It's all come out.
[2:42:53.520 --> 2:42:55.520]  And they're doing that not because we're weak,
[2:42:55.520 --> 2:43:00.520]  but because we're made the image of God, the Creator and we are powerful.
[2:43:00.520 --> 2:43:03.520]  Social engineers fear that so much.
[2:43:03.520 --> 2:43:07.520]  So that's why I repeat that famous Internet saying that nobody knows who first came up
[2:43:07.520 --> 2:43:08.520]  with the boy.
[2:43:08.520 --> 2:43:10.520]  Is it true?
[2:43:10.520 --> 2:43:16.520]  The propaganda would not be necessary if the situation was hopeless.
[2:43:16.520 --> 2:43:20.520]  They need all their propaganda and all their lies and all their evil and all their cultural
[2:43:20.520 --> 2:43:25.520]  death because they know we are strong.
[2:43:25.520 --> 2:43:29.520]  And they know in the end they signed on to God of this world who is a loser.
[2:43:29.520 --> 2:43:33.520]  And that's why it's so important that everybody keep info wars in the air now more than ever.
[2:43:33.520 --> 2:43:37.520]  Because even if you don't believe in God, what the globalists are manifesting and setting
[2:43:37.520 --> 2:43:38.520]  up is satanic.
[2:43:38.520 --> 2:43:43.520]  And we are opposing the one world government and the mark of the beast they just announced.
[2:43:43.520 --> 2:43:49.520]  One of the most studied and researched areas of human health and physiology is inflammation.
[2:43:49.520 --> 2:43:50.520]  It's associated with cancer.
[2:43:50.520 --> 2:43:52.520]  It's associated with joint problems.
[2:43:52.520 --> 2:43:55.520]  It's associated with viral infections, bacterial infections.
[2:43:55.520 --> 2:44:00.520]  It's associated with death and out of all the incredible compounds that God gave us through
[2:44:00.520 --> 2:44:05.520]  nature that fights inflammation and makes our lives better, turmeric is chief amongst
[2:44:05.520 --> 2:44:06.520]  them all.
[2:44:06.520 --> 2:44:11.520]  And chief amongst all the turmeric products out there is body's ultimate turmeric formula.
[2:44:11.520 --> 2:44:12.520]  My wife loves turmeric.
[2:44:12.520 --> 2:44:16.520]  She has joint pain but she has to take a lot of it, the type of stuff she buys at the grocery
[2:44:16.520 --> 2:44:17.520]  store for it to work.
[2:44:17.520 --> 2:44:20.520]  She started taking this and said I only need to take one pill instead of four.
[2:44:20.520 --> 2:44:21.520]  Why is it so good?
[2:44:21.520 --> 2:44:23.520]  It's not just turmeric.
[2:44:23.520 --> 2:44:26.520]  It's concentrated with the proprietary process.
[2:44:26.520 --> 2:44:32.520]  It's back in stock and for being sold out almost five months at infowarstore.com for 40% off.
[2:44:32.520 --> 2:44:36.520]  But supplies are going to sell out quick because of supply chain breakdowns and because we will
[2:44:36.520 --> 2:44:38.520]  not lower the quality of this product.
[2:44:38.520 --> 2:44:41.520]  And body's is one of our best selling products because it really does work and people love
[2:44:41.520 --> 2:44:42.520]  it.
[2:44:42.520 --> 2:45:10.520]  That's it for today at infowarstore.com.
[2:45:12.520 --> 2:45:17.520]  Well, we know this is all really happening and it's unbelievably unsettling to see.
[2:45:17.520 --> 2:45:19.520]  But there's only two things to do.
[2:45:19.520 --> 2:45:22.520]  We continue sounding the alarm because it's a numbers game.
[2:45:22.520 --> 2:45:26.520]  If enough people awaken from the cold spell then we win.
[2:45:26.520 --> 2:45:31.520]  But even when we win and we eventually will, the days of convenience are soon coming to
[2:45:31.520 --> 2:45:32.520]  an end.
[2:45:32.520 --> 2:45:37.520]  And so we must prepare, get up to a year's worth of storable foods, water filtration,
[2:45:37.520 --> 2:45:45.520]  survival gear, seeds, shortwave radios, and lifesaving knowledge at infowarstore.com.
[2:45:45.520 --> 2:45:51.520]  The technocrats, the social engineers, the behavioral psychologist, they're all part
[2:45:51.520 --> 2:45:58.520]  of the same satanic globalist control freak system that seeks to play God, that seeks
[2:45:58.520 --> 2:46:04.520]  to turn the general population of this earth into their slaves, into putty, into clay,
[2:46:04.520 --> 2:46:07.520]  into their hands that they control.
[2:46:07.520 --> 2:46:12.520]  And chief amongst their physical attacks is keeping us from high quality vitamins and
[2:46:12.520 --> 2:46:15.520]  minerals that are essential for life on this planet.
[2:46:15.520 --> 2:46:20.520]  And so the information we cover exposes their evil works and sabotages their globalist
[2:46:20.520 --> 2:46:21.520]  takeover.
[2:46:21.520 --> 2:46:25.520]  And we're having an incredible effect thanks to your support and your word of mouth.
[2:46:25.520 --> 2:46:29.520]  But it's also important to take care of our bodies themselves with high quality water
[2:46:29.520 --> 2:46:31.520]  filtration at infowarstore.com.
[2:46:31.520 --> 2:46:36.520]  And with amazing supplements, many of which that just came back in stock, like bodies,
[2:46:36.520 --> 2:46:41.520]  ultimate turmeric formula, now 40% off for a limited time at infowarstore.com.
[2:46:41.520 --> 2:46:44.520]  So let's fight the info war, but also take care of our bodies.
[2:46:44.520 --> 2:46:49.520]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:46:57.520 --> 2:47:02.520]  So it's very important to add about this default against me here in Austin, Texas,
[2:47:02.520 --> 2:47:07.520]  against Owen and everything out of the day in court and others, is that even the Huffington
[2:47:07.520 --> 2:47:10.520]  Post and groups talked to lawyers that said, we don't even know this is real.
[2:47:10.520 --> 2:47:12.520]  We don't believe courts can even do this.
[2:47:12.520 --> 2:47:17.520]  This doesn't even exist unless somebody basically just runs off and doesn't show up for court.
[2:47:17.520 --> 2:47:20.520]  So this is real, real corruption.
[2:47:20.520 --> 2:47:24.520]  And the judge even said, I'm doing this because you criticized me and said I'm having a show
[2:47:24.520 --> 2:47:25.520]  trial, which she'd been doing.
[2:47:25.520 --> 2:47:29.520]  She'd been saying we'd given them no information, which isn't true.
[2:47:29.520 --> 2:47:31.520]  And she talked about a default.
[2:47:31.520 --> 2:47:33.520]  And I said, if that's the case, it's a show trial.
[2:47:33.520 --> 2:47:34.520]  Well, hell, it's not a show trial.
[2:47:34.520 --> 2:47:35.520]  It's no trial at all.
[2:47:35.520 --> 2:47:37.520]  Here they are finishing up.
[2:47:37.520 --> 2:47:42.520]  Because these are constitutional rights, rights to do process of law, rights to a trial and
[2:47:42.520 --> 2:47:48.520]  rights to trial by jury that are being stripped of someone, it can only be done under extreme
[2:47:48.520 --> 2:47:50.520]  and extraordinary circumstances.
[2:47:50.520 --> 2:47:52.520]  But the left doesn't recognize these rules.
[2:47:52.520 --> 2:47:53.520]  They don't care about them.
[2:47:53.520 --> 2:47:55.520]  They're like, we don't like you.
[2:47:55.520 --> 2:47:56.520]  You're Alex Jones.
[2:47:56.520 --> 2:48:00.520]  They they they carved out a separate rules for Alex Jones on defamation law that they
[2:48:00.520 --> 2:48:02.520]  haven't applied to anyone else.
[2:48:02.520 --> 2:48:06.520]  They carved out separate rules on First Amendment law that they haven't applied to anyone else.
[2:48:06.520 --> 2:48:10.520]  They carved out separate laws on public speech outside of the courthouse that they haven't
[2:48:10.520 --> 2:48:11.520]  applied to anyone else.
[2:48:11.520 --> 2:48:16.520]  The court system is making a mockery of itself because it is such inflamed and political
[2:48:16.520 --> 2:48:18.520]  prejudice against Alex Jones.
[2:48:18.520 --> 2:48:22.520]  And who is being really judged by this process is not Alex Jones.
[2:48:22.520 --> 2:48:27.520]  It's the abhorrent lack of respect for the law by the courts themselves.
[2:48:27.520 --> 2:48:31.520]  And Robert, I mean, I know why you're angry with this because this is the ultimate irony.
[2:48:31.520 --> 2:48:32.520]  And I got to bring this up.
[2:48:32.520 --> 2:48:34.520]  Kangaroo Court from Chris Hill.
[2:48:34.520 --> 2:48:36.520]  I didn't read the judgment.
[2:48:36.520 --> 2:48:37.520]  I really want to.
[2:48:37.520 --> 2:48:39.520]  And I might do a standalone on this.
[2:48:39.520 --> 2:48:45.520]  I just read a few articles where the judge apparently cited Alex Jones repeatedly saying
[2:48:45.520 --> 2:48:50.520]  this was a show trial, a mockery of the system to show his contempt for the process.
[2:48:50.520 --> 2:48:55.520]  And what does the judge do after all of this says, you're not even going to get a trial.
[2:48:55.520 --> 2:49:01.520]  I'm going to be in your behavior to be so bad for having called us a mockery, a show
[2:49:01.520 --> 2:49:02.520]  trial.
[2:49:02.520 --> 2:49:03.520]  I'm going to be so bad.
[2:49:03.520 --> 2:49:05.520]  I'm not going to give you a trial.
[2:49:05.520 --> 2:49:07.520]  Thus, hate him or love him.
[2:49:07.520 --> 2:49:09.520]  And I've got to meet him now.
[2:49:09.520 --> 2:49:10.520]  I don't hate him.
[2:49:10.520 --> 2:49:13.520]  I think he's actually, you know, he's he's been like a lot of people know he's been
[2:49:13.520 --> 2:49:16.520]  right a lot more than a broken clock.
[2:49:16.520 --> 2:49:18.520]  But love him or hate him.
[2:49:18.520 --> 2:49:20.520]  He says this is a show trial.
[2:49:20.520 --> 2:49:21.520]  And what does the judge do?
[2:49:21.520 --> 2:49:25.520]  She gets so mad at him for saying it's a show trial that she doesn't give him a day in court
[2:49:25.520 --> 2:49:28.520]  for the hearing on the merits default judgment.
[2:49:28.520 --> 2:49:34.520]  So obvious question, what are his remedies and what shall he be availing himself to?
[2:49:34.520 --> 2:49:37.520]  So there'll be, I mean, this is almost unprecedented.
[2:49:37.520 --> 2:49:41.520]  So like almost everything else in his cases, it's figuring out what do you do when the court
[2:49:41.520 --> 2:49:44.520]  system is so biased that it just won't apply the law.
[2:49:44.520 --> 2:49:47.520]  You can't trust it to enforce the law.
[2:49:47.520 --> 2:49:49.520]  That's novel.
[2:49:49.520 --> 2:49:51.520]  I mean, so I deal with that in a lot of my other cases.
[2:49:51.520 --> 2:49:55.520]  But because my case is so political, that's the nature of them.
[2:49:55.520 --> 2:50:01.520]  But it's still shocking to witness, I mean, especially under the, again, if you have great
[2:50:01.520 --> 2:50:06.520]  confidence in your case, if you're the plaintiff's lawyer, if you're the court, if you believe
[2:50:06.520 --> 2:50:09.520]  that Alex Jones was wrong, let a jury say so.
[2:50:09.520 --> 2:50:11.520]  Let the evidence be fully presented.
[2:50:11.520 --> 2:50:17.520]  Why, why be so scared of an Austin jury, which is going to be a very liberal Democratic jury?
[2:50:17.520 --> 2:50:22.520]  It's very revelatory that all of these judges won't let him have his day in court.
[2:50:22.520 --> 2:50:27.520]  It's almost as if they know something about these cases that these cases won't hold up in the way
[2:50:27.520 --> 2:50:29.520]  some people think.
[2:50:29.520 --> 2:50:33.520]  But right now what happens is so he's, you know, there's all the ways you can procedurally
[2:50:33.520 --> 2:50:36.520]  challenge a default judgment so he can deal with that part of it.
[2:50:36.520 --> 2:50:38.520]  They're going to have a jury trial on damages.
[2:50:38.520 --> 2:50:44.520]  That's the only thing they're allowing a jury trial on damages in Austin in May, according
[2:50:44.520 --> 2:50:46.520]  to the records.
[2:50:46.520 --> 2:50:48.520]  And so he'll be defending himself on that.
[2:50:48.520 --> 2:50:53.520]  And then I think, you know, the media lied, massive libel campaign by the media.
[2:50:53.520 --> 2:50:58.520]  The media went out there and told everybody, oh, there's been a substantive ruling on the merits.
[2:50:58.520 --> 2:51:01.520]  Alex Jones lost because he couldn't produce evidence.
[2:51:01.520 --> 2:51:02.520]  That's all a media lie.
[2:51:02.520 --> 2:51:07.520]  NBC, ABC, CNN, all of them are just flat out lying about Alex Jones.
[2:51:07.520 --> 2:51:09.520]  Why is it if Alex Jones is so bad?
[2:51:09.520 --> 2:51:11.520]  The media always has to lie about him.
[2:51:11.520 --> 2:51:14.520]  And just everybody's clear because I mean, I've been reading it and I'm familiar with it.
[2:51:14.520 --> 2:51:20.520]  They said he could not, the framing is he could not produce evidence to substantiate his claims.
[2:51:20.520 --> 2:51:23.520]  Let's just even assume that that were true.
[2:51:23.520 --> 2:51:26.520]  He could not produce evidence to substantiate his claims.
[2:51:26.520 --> 2:51:29.520]  That might only mean that he didn't have the evidence to substantiate them.
[2:51:29.520 --> 2:51:31.520]  It wouldn't prove the falseness.
[2:51:31.520 --> 2:51:34.520]  Even if you get to the next step, which is proving the actual falseness of the statements,
[2:51:34.520 --> 2:51:41.520]  you might then arguably have to deal with the criteria of actual malice because these are public figures.
[2:51:41.520 --> 2:51:42.520]  What's the word?
[2:51:42.520 --> 2:51:44.520]  Spontaneous.
[2:51:44.520 --> 2:51:46.520]  Well, in Texas, they changed the rules on that too.
[2:51:46.520 --> 2:51:50.520]  They were pretending they were private figures that they weren't public figures.
[2:51:50.520 --> 2:51:53.520]  I mean, that's why it's like every crazy rule that did come about.
[2:51:53.520 --> 2:51:56.520]  But that's why it's like if the media's interpretation was right,
[2:51:56.520 --> 2:52:00.520]  that he didn't have evidence to support his position, then you go to trial.
[2:52:00.520 --> 2:52:02.520]  You don't do a default judgment.
[2:52:02.520 --> 2:52:06.520]  You only go to a default judgment when you think even an Austin liberal jury will rule
[2:52:06.520 --> 2:52:09.520]  in Alex Jones's favor when they hear the actual facts,
[2:52:09.520 --> 2:52:13.520]  because they would hear very different set of facts than the media's told.
[2:52:13.520 --> 2:52:19.520]  And so they would find out things totally opposite of what the media has been telling people about the case and about him.
[2:52:19.520 --> 2:52:25.520]  And so it tells you a lot that liberals are afraid of their own jury pools in these kind of cases,
[2:52:25.520 --> 2:52:29.520]  that they have to rig the system to try to just shaft Alex Jones.
[2:52:29.520 --> 2:52:35.520]  Ultimately, this default judgment, my prediction, will be overturned by the Texas Supreme Court
[2:52:35.520 --> 2:52:42.520]  because it's such a egregious breach of the law, such a clear violation of constitutional right,
[2:52:42.520 --> 2:52:44.520]  and makes such a mockery.
[2:52:44.520 --> 2:52:49.520]  The Texas Supreme Court has to keep stepping in because the Austin Court just can't follow the law.
[2:52:49.520 --> 2:52:54.520]  And the Austin Texas Court of Appeals can't follow the law when it comes to political cases.
[2:52:54.520 --> 2:52:59.520]  And just so that nobody thinks Robert is being unfair because he's partial,
[2:52:59.520 --> 2:53:01.520]  I won't say biased, partial to Alex Jones,
[2:53:01.520 --> 2:53:05.520]  when Robert says it's unprecedented, you can go pull up the articles.
[2:53:05.520 --> 2:53:11.520]  Even the counsel for the plaintiffs recognize acknowledged publicly stated it's unprecedented.
[2:53:11.520 --> 2:53:16.520]  They just say it's warranted under the circumstances because it's a unique set of fact pattern.
[2:53:16.520 --> 2:53:20.520]  But when you, if anybody thinks this is a default judgment,
[2:53:20.520 --> 2:53:25.520]  meaning there had been no trial on the merits to prove the evidence
[2:53:25.520 --> 2:53:30.520]  that is now going to go through as a foregone fact for adjudication on damages.
[2:53:30.520 --> 2:53:33.520]  If anybody thinks that this is the new criteria,
[2:53:33.520 --> 2:53:36.520]  there's an analogy in there to something that's going on right now.
[2:53:36.520 --> 2:53:41.520]  Oh, yes, in terms of the requirements for mass vaccination based on risk of a virus.
[2:53:41.520 --> 2:53:45.520]  If that's the new criteria, you'll be getting default judgments left, right, and center,
[2:53:45.520 --> 2:53:49.520]  just based on who is politically expedient to get them against and who is not.
[2:53:49.520 --> 2:53:53.520]  It's, I hadn't followed the case in a long time.
[2:53:53.520 --> 2:53:55.520]  And when I read it, who's the judge, Robert, by the way?
[2:53:55.520 --> 2:53:57.520]  Do we know who appointed this judge?
[2:53:57.520 --> 2:54:00.520]  They're, they're elected there at the state court level in Austin.
[2:54:00.520 --> 2:54:04.520]  And same with all, in fact, all levels of courts are elected.
[2:54:04.520 --> 2:54:09.520]  So trial courts and the appellate courts are all overwhelmingly liberal Democrats.
[2:54:09.520 --> 2:54:13.520]  And it's, you know, to me, it's, there used to be some old school liberal Democrats
[2:54:13.520 --> 2:54:16.520]  that understood the importance of the rule of law,
[2:54:16.520 --> 2:54:20.520]  understood the perception of the fairness of a proceedings.
[2:54:20.520 --> 2:54:23.520]  These judges, in my view, do not. They don't respect that at all.
[2:54:23.520 --> 2:54:27.520]  But now, just to reconcile, maybe something that might be incompatible here.
[2:54:27.520 --> 2:54:31.520]  If it's, if it's an elected judge, I mean, I now that I know how people get elected
[2:54:31.520 --> 2:54:37.520]  at a municipal and a lower level, you know, level, it's not by massive amounts of votes.
[2:54:37.520 --> 2:54:40.520]  It's by a very small amount of highly involved individuals,
[2:54:40.520 --> 2:54:44.520]  which is why I now fully appreciate, and in a cynical sense,
[2:54:44.520 --> 2:54:49.520]  the strategy of infiltrating these systems at the local level because it requires
[2:54:49.520 --> 2:54:53.520]  so little manpower to do it at a level where, you know, you can get elected
[2:54:53.520 --> 2:54:55.520]  or not elected by 30 votes.
[2:54:55.520 --> 2:54:57.520]  And so if you just have a lot of money to put into these things,
[2:54:57.520 --> 2:55:02.520]  you can really change things from the bottom up, from a cynical or Machiavellian
[2:55:02.520 --> 2:55:06.520]  or good perspective. But this judge was elected, which means, in theory,
[2:55:06.520 --> 2:55:09.520]  the constituents wanted this type of judge with these types of rules.
[2:55:09.520 --> 2:55:10.520]  It's worse than that.
[2:55:10.520 --> 2:55:15.520]  It's, it's what, I mean, they assume though this will be something judges, they gave it to her liberal Austin
[2:55:15.520 --> 2:55:20.520]  that liked to pride itself originally on being creative and outside the box.
[2:55:20.520 --> 2:55:22.520]  That's now authoritarian Austin.
[2:55:22.520 --> 2:55:26.520]  And it's what's happened to liberal jurisdictions across really the entire western world,
[2:55:26.520 --> 2:55:31.520]  that these are people that are, you have Kevin Oberman and other people just going on authoritarian rants,
[2:55:31.520 --> 2:55:36.520]  not even, I mean, that are indistinguishable from the rants I used to see people
[2:55:36.520 --> 2:55:40.520]  when they attacked AIDS victims back in the 80s.
[2:55:40.520 --> 2:55:44.520]  The same kind of language, the same kind of just, I mean, Nazi language.
[2:55:44.520 --> 2:55:45.520]  That's what it is.
[2:55:45.520 --> 2:55:49.520]  I mean, you know, the, and so, I mean, that's what Joe Rogan pointed out.
[2:55:49.520 --> 2:55:54.520]  I mean, Rogan got into hot water because he just pointed out, you know, we,
[2:55:54.520 --> 2:55:57.520]  when you allow this kind of breach, this is where it ends up.
[2:55:57.520 --> 2:56:03.520]  And if you don't stop it early, then before you know it, you're sliding downhill fast.
[2:56:03.520 --> 2:56:07.520]  And just so everybody knows, agree or disagree with the judge,
[2:56:07.520 --> 2:56:11.520]  understand the distinction imparted on anybody who repeats that statement.
[2:56:11.520 --> 2:56:13.520]  He was found guilty on the merits.
[2:56:13.520 --> 2:56:16.520]  This is a default judgment, which means that there was no,
[2:56:16.520 --> 2:56:20.520]  there was no evidentiary hearing on the substantive aspect of the plaintiff's calling.
[2:56:20.520 --> 2:56:22.520]  That's right. Thank you, Viva Free.
[2:56:22.520 --> 2:56:25.520]  The rest of it is on his YouTube channel.
[2:56:25.520 --> 2:56:28.520]  You can just type in Robert Barnes or Viva Free on YouTube and find it.
[2:56:28.520 --> 2:56:29.520]  Very, very popular shows.
[2:56:29.520 --> 2:56:32.520]  Some of their stuff gets millions of views, most of them hundreds of thousands.
[2:56:32.520 --> 2:56:33.520]  Good guys.
[2:56:33.520 --> 2:56:34.520]  And what they're saying is totally true.
[2:56:34.520 --> 2:56:39.520]  I mean, I know a lot of Democrats in Austin that are actually decent people,
[2:56:39.520 --> 2:56:41.520]  and they didn't believe it when they saw it.
[2:56:41.520 --> 2:56:42.520]  They thought that was a joke.
[2:56:42.520 --> 2:56:46.520]  And then lawyers that have been involved are just like, what?
[2:56:46.520 --> 2:56:50.520]  You're saying we didn't, and they're like, we know you've got this and that.
[2:56:50.520 --> 2:56:52.520]  It's sort of like this game where they go, we know you've got it.
[2:56:52.520 --> 2:56:54.520]  And you're like, I don't know, I don't have that.
[2:56:54.520 --> 2:56:56.520]  But see, they have to have me be the bad guy.
[2:56:56.520 --> 2:57:00.520]  They can't actually finally, after attacking me and claiming I did this to these kids or whatever,
[2:57:00.520 --> 2:57:05.520]  then actually have the trial where most of what they say is true.
[2:57:05.520 --> 2:57:08.520]  That'll make them look like fools.
[2:57:08.520 --> 2:57:11.520]  So instead, they're now going to try to drag me in there in front of a jury
[2:57:11.520 --> 2:57:12.520]  where they say he's all guilty.
[2:57:12.520 --> 2:57:14.520]  Just how bad is he and how much money?
[2:57:14.520 --> 2:57:17.520]  And they're already sending the stuff over here like, how much money you got?
[2:57:17.520 --> 2:57:18.520]  We're going to get your money.
[2:57:18.520 --> 2:57:19.520]  I mean, it's just a joke.
[2:57:19.520 --> 2:57:20.520]  So am I worried about me?
[2:57:20.520 --> 2:57:22.520]  No, the country's going down.
[2:57:22.520 --> 2:57:26.520]  It's like, I've got a sprained foot and the ship's sinking it on fire.
[2:57:26.520 --> 2:57:28.520]  I'm not worried about my sprained foot.
[2:57:28.520 --> 2:57:33.520]  The left are mad dogs.
[2:57:33.520 --> 2:57:39.520]  The engineers at BioProse are very excited to announce a major expansion of new products
[2:57:39.520 --> 2:57:42.520]  into the retail consumer market.
[2:57:42.520 --> 2:57:45.520]  Since their rollout of their first product almost a year ago,
[2:57:45.520 --> 2:57:47.520]  they come out with four new products.
[2:57:47.520 --> 2:57:54.520]  Biodrain Pro, Biorv Pro, Biomarine Pro, and Biorporta Pro.
[2:57:54.520 --> 2:57:59.520]  For decades, oil companies and other major chemical corporations
[2:57:59.520 --> 2:58:04.520]  have been using patented, naturally occurring, specially bred bacteria
[2:58:04.520 --> 2:58:08.520]  to eat oil spills and other toxic waste disasters.
[2:58:08.520 --> 2:58:12.520]  That's how powerful these naturally occurring microbes are.
[2:58:12.520 --> 2:58:17.520]  The BioProse system is light years better than traditional enzymes that only work once.
[2:58:17.520 --> 2:58:21.520]  These bacteria begin to breed and live in your septic tank.
[2:58:21.520 --> 2:58:24.520]  And now it's available for the general public's use
[2:58:24.520 --> 2:58:38.520]  for the first time on the retail market, exclusively available at TheBioProse.com.
[2:58:38.520 --> 2:58:41.520]  Because of the globalist reset, infowars, listeners, and viewers know
[2:58:41.520 --> 2:58:46.520]  a lot of our best selling products have been sold out in some cases for up to a year.
[2:58:46.520 --> 2:58:53.520]  Body's ultimate turmeric formula with 95% or humanoid has been sold out for almost five months
[2:58:53.520 --> 2:58:56.520]  because, again, the high-quality turmeric and the concentration process
[2:58:56.520 --> 2:58:59.520]  is very, very expensive and time-consuming.
[2:58:59.520 --> 2:59:02.520]  And with the supply chain breakdowns and all the rest of the problems,
[2:59:02.520 --> 2:59:03.520]  we've been unable to get it.
[2:59:03.520 --> 2:59:06.520]  But we finally got a shipment in and it's 40% off.
[2:59:06.520 --> 2:59:09.520]  It is the secret weapon when it comes to your immune system,
[2:59:09.520 --> 2:59:12.520]  when it comes to antioxidants, when it comes to your joints,
[2:59:12.520 --> 2:59:13.520]  when it comes to your whole body.
[2:59:13.520 --> 2:59:17.520]  People absolutely love Body's ultimate turmeric formula.
[2:59:17.520 --> 2:59:20.520]  Incredible amounts of five-star reviews at infowarsstore.com.
[2:59:20.520 --> 2:59:26.520]  And it's back in stock at infowarsstore.com and it funds the Infowar, a true 360 win.
[2:59:26.520 --> 2:59:54.520]  Body's ultimate turmeric formula back in stock at infowarsstore.com for a limited time.
[2:59:54.520 --> 2:59:56.520]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[2:59:56.520 --> 2:59:59.520]  Final segment I'm hosting and then Jay Dyer, one of the smartest people I know
[2:59:59.520 --> 3:00:04.520]  and definitely the most up-to-date informed on new documents and global statements
[3:00:04.520 --> 3:00:07.520]  is going to take over in the next 54 minutes.
[3:00:07.520 --> 3:00:10.520]  So he takes over about five minutes for the next 54 minutes.
[3:00:10.520 --> 3:00:13.520]  And I've got a question I'm going to ask him now,
[3:00:13.520 --> 3:00:15.520]  because I know he's already on the Skype waiting to come on.
[3:00:15.520 --> 3:00:17.520]  We can punch him up if you want here in a moment.
[3:00:17.520 --> 3:00:20.520]  I wanted to answer this just out of my own selfishness.
[3:00:20.520 --> 3:00:23.520]  Do you think, Jay, and I know you're listening now, just to answer later,
[3:00:23.520 --> 3:00:25.520]  whatever you want in the next hour.
[3:00:25.520 --> 3:00:27.520]  And it's a big question.
[3:00:27.520 --> 3:00:30.520]  Maybe you want to come back next week on my main show and answer it.
[3:00:30.520 --> 3:00:34.520]  But can it be turned around once they've initiated the depopulation,
[3:00:34.520 --> 3:00:39.520]  once it's confirmed that this was a bio-weapon, that they weren't just doing a test,
[3:00:39.520 --> 3:00:41.520]  they're moving forward with societal world collapse,
[3:00:41.520 --> 3:00:44.520]  they've now come out with the World ID, the carbon tax, they're admitting,
[3:00:44.520 --> 3:00:46.520]  hey, we're doing this for the earth,
[3:00:46.520 --> 3:00:49.520]  COVID was just the excuse for the shutdown of the human system.
[3:00:49.520 --> 3:00:52.520]  Can we get their own minions to stand up and say no?
[3:00:52.520 --> 3:00:55.520]  Is there any way out of this?
[3:00:55.520 --> 3:01:00.520]  Because I know we can trust in those that help themselves,
[3:01:00.520 --> 3:01:05.520]  and trust in God, but also row away from the rocks as Hunter Ness Thompson said.
[3:01:05.520 --> 3:01:08.520]  So I trust in God, and I also trust a lot of people to stand up and fight back.
[3:01:08.520 --> 3:01:13.520]  But it's just a really big question of can,
[3:01:13.520 --> 3:01:16.520]  even if Klaus Schwab and Bill Gates and their controllers got arrested,
[3:01:16.520 --> 3:01:21.520]  what they've initiated now is just so psychotic where it's admitted that they've created a bio-weapon,
[3:01:21.520 --> 3:01:24.520]  that kills 80% of humans at Wuhan,
[3:01:24.520 --> 3:01:26.520]  that they stole out of the Canadian lab,
[3:01:26.520 --> 3:01:28.520]  and that Bill Gates has control of.
[3:01:28.520 --> 3:01:30.520]  I mean, that's in the news.
[3:01:30.520 --> 3:01:33.520]  And so like Fauci and Gates have a gun to our head,
[3:01:33.520 --> 3:01:35.520]  and Gates is the head of the G8,
[3:01:35.520 --> 3:01:38.520]  the head of the G8 said he really is the head of the G8.
[3:01:38.520 --> 3:01:41.520]  So we're living in a James Bond movie like Moon Raker folks,
[3:01:41.520 --> 3:01:43.520]  real end of the world for humans as we know it stuff.
[3:01:43.520 --> 3:01:45.520]  Jay Dyer takes over just a few minutes.
[3:01:45.520 --> 3:01:49.520]  Separately, this is a great product, and they're a huge sponsor,
[3:01:49.520 --> 3:01:51.520]  and they're selling a lot of it.
[3:01:51.520 --> 3:01:54.520]  But nothing compared to what the big oil company,
[3:01:54.520 --> 3:01:56.520]  that scientists developed this,
[3:01:56.520 --> 3:01:58.520]  created this when the scientist is a listener,
[3:01:58.520 --> 3:02:01.520]  and he has the patent, and it's the famous bacteria that's natural,
[3:02:01.520 --> 3:02:04.520]  especially bread that eats oil, crap,
[3:02:04.520 --> 3:02:06.520]  anything you want taken care of.
[3:02:06.520 --> 3:02:09.520]  Old shoes, I mean, but it's safe for all the tanks,
[3:02:09.520 --> 3:02:12.520]  safe for all the septic systems, safe for everything.
[3:02:12.520 --> 3:02:18.520]  It's BioSeptic Pro, a six to 12 month supply for all of your septic tanks
[3:02:18.520 --> 3:02:20.520]  to kill the odor to make it last longer.
[3:02:20.520 --> 3:02:25.520]  It's not like the enzymes that just go away after one treatment.
[3:02:25.520 --> 3:02:28.520]  This lives in your septic tank sometimes for years,
[3:02:28.520 --> 3:02:32.520]  but we just say six to 12 months.
[3:02:32.520 --> 3:02:34.520]  We're very, very proud of it,
[3:02:34.520 --> 3:02:36.520]  and now they've come out with four other brands of it
[3:02:36.520 --> 3:02:38.520]  that I'll show you here on your TV viewer.
[3:02:38.520 --> 3:02:40.520]  They have it for RVs, they have it for boats,
[3:02:40.520 --> 3:02:42.520]  they have it for ported potties,
[3:02:42.520 --> 3:02:44.520]  and the most important one I think is for drains.
[3:02:44.520 --> 3:02:46.520]  You get drains clogged up, you call a plumber,
[3:02:46.520 --> 3:02:48.520]  they're reclogged in the shower or wherever,
[3:02:48.520 --> 3:02:50.520]  you put drain O down it, doesn't work,
[3:02:50.520 --> 3:02:52.520]  or doesn't work long enough.
[3:02:52.520 --> 3:02:55.520]  I dumped this because we already come out with the same powder.
[3:02:55.520 --> 3:02:57.520]  When we first got samples of it a couple of years ago
[3:02:57.520 --> 3:02:59.520]  before we were able to even get them to bring us to consumers,
[3:02:59.520 --> 3:03:01.520]  and I put it into my drains that were having problems,
[3:03:01.520 --> 3:03:05.520]  like my shower drain, never had a problem again,
[3:03:05.520 --> 3:03:07.520]  and that was over a year and a half ago.
[3:03:07.520 --> 3:03:10.520]  So one scoop down my shower drain,
[3:03:10.520 --> 3:03:12.520]  and then it just went in there and just lives in there
[3:03:12.520 --> 3:03:15.520]  and eats everything up in there, the hair and the skin particles
[3:03:15.520 --> 3:03:17.520]  and the soap and all the garbage.
[3:03:17.520 --> 3:03:23.520]  So I love the BioPros pipes and drains product, okay?
[3:03:23.520 --> 3:03:25.520]  It's all the same stuff, different packaging,
[3:03:25.520 --> 3:03:27.520]  some has this applicator, some has that applicator,
[3:03:27.520 --> 3:03:29.520]  one application for an RVs, one size,
[3:03:29.520 --> 3:03:31.520]  one application for drains, another,
[3:03:31.520 --> 3:03:33.520]  one application for a septic tank,
[3:03:33.520 --> 3:03:37.520]  but BioDrainPro, I think, is just your best bang for the buck,
[3:03:37.520 --> 3:03:39.520]  and you can buy any of this, it's all the same stuff
[3:03:39.520 --> 3:03:41.520]  and put it in the drain, this just gives the directions
[3:03:41.520 --> 3:03:43.520]  on that package for how you do it,
[3:03:43.520 --> 3:03:45.520]  that's why it has different packaging.
[3:03:45.520 --> 3:03:47.520]  BioSepticPro, BioMarinePro, BioDrainPro,
[3:03:47.520 --> 3:03:51.520]  BioRVPro, BioPortapottyPro,
[3:03:51.520 --> 3:03:55.520]  all at the great website, thebiopros.com,
[3:03:55.520 --> 3:04:01.520]  thebiopros.com, just one word, thebiopros.com,
[3:04:01.520 --> 3:04:07.520]  T-H-E-B-I-O-P-R-O.com, thebiopros.com,
[3:04:07.520 --> 3:04:10.520]  and it's an amazing product, and I'm really proud of this,
[3:04:10.520 --> 3:04:13.520]  because I went and got the guys to do it,
[3:04:13.520 --> 3:04:14.520]  and got the big oil company to agree,
[3:04:14.520 --> 3:04:15.520]  and got the contracts done,
[3:04:15.520 --> 3:04:17.520]  and got them to put in a smaller factory,
[3:04:17.520 --> 3:04:19.520]  and I put up the money to get them to go ahead
[3:04:19.520 --> 3:04:22.520]  and originally make the stuff, so you get it.
[3:04:22.520 --> 3:04:24.520]  They use this at industrial pig farms everywhere,
[3:04:24.520 --> 3:04:26.520]  just eats it all up.
[3:04:26.520 --> 3:04:28.520]  They put this in the lakes of pig crap,
[3:04:28.520 --> 3:04:31.520]  and they sell tons of it a day all over the world,
[3:04:31.520 --> 3:04:35.520]  but now it's available to you, the consumer.
[3:04:35.520 --> 3:04:38.520]  Infowarsstore.com is also going to be selling it soon,
[3:04:38.520 --> 3:04:41.520]  but now it's only available at thebiopros.com.
[3:04:41.520 --> 3:05:10.520]  J. Dyer takes over in 60 seconds.

[3:05:14.520 --> 3:05:16.520]  And Vaso Beats is selling out fast,
[3:05:16.520 --> 3:05:18.520]  so good for your heart, your lungs,
[3:05:18.520 --> 3:05:19.520]  your cardiovascular system,
[3:05:19.520 --> 3:05:21.520]  it creates nitrous oxide in the blood.
[3:05:21.520 --> 3:05:23.520]  It's a really strong concentrate as well.
[3:05:23.520 --> 3:05:25.520]  It's 50% off.
[3:05:25.520 --> 3:05:28.520]  Crill Oil is selling out fast, 40% off.
[3:05:28.520 --> 3:05:29.520]  Oh my God, do you think fish oil is good?
[3:05:29.520 --> 3:05:31.520]  This is amazing, Crill Oil.
[3:05:31.520 --> 3:05:34.520]  DNA Force Plus, I've extended that for a few more days,
[3:05:34.520 --> 3:05:37.520]  40% off back in stock, amazing.
[3:05:37.520 --> 3:05:39.520]  Down and out, 50% off.
[3:05:39.520 --> 3:05:41.520]  It's got eight different natural compounds
[3:05:41.520 --> 3:05:42.520]  for deeper, cleaner sleep.
[3:05:42.520 --> 3:05:46.520]  It's all available at Infowarsstore.com.
[3:05:46.520 --> 3:06:09.520]  Welcome back to The Alex Jones Show.
[3:06:09.520 --> 3:06:11.520]  I got a chance to read through that.
[3:06:11.520 --> 3:06:14.520]  Wow, it fits very well with some other amazing documents
[3:06:14.520 --> 3:06:18.520]  that have come forth in the last couple weeks.
[3:06:18.520 --> 3:06:21.520]  That is the human augmentation dawn of a new paradigm
[3:06:21.520 --> 3:06:23.520]  by the Ministry of Defense at the UK
[3:06:23.520 --> 3:06:26.520]  in concert with the German government.
[3:06:26.520 --> 3:06:30.520]  And these, again, these two documents really go well together
[3:06:30.520 --> 3:06:32.520]  in the sense of a coordinated plan,
[3:06:32.520 --> 3:06:34.520]  coordinated overall agenda.
[3:06:34.520 --> 3:06:38.520]  And we'll see that here as we get into the actual text.
[3:06:38.520 --> 3:06:42.520]  This is, in my view, kind of in concert with a series
[3:06:42.520 --> 3:06:45.520]  of PSY OPS documents that have come out over the last,
[3:06:45.520 --> 3:06:47.520]  I don't know, 20 or 30 years,
[3:06:47.520 --> 3:06:50.520]  we could go back to famous documents
[3:06:50.520 --> 3:06:52.520]  like The Mine Has No Firewall.
[3:06:52.520 --> 3:06:54.520]  Now, if you've never read these,
[3:06:54.520 --> 3:06:56.520]  I highly recommend going and looking them up.
[3:06:56.520 --> 3:06:57.520]  They're easy to access.
[3:06:57.520 --> 3:07:00.520]  These are actually Army War College,
[3:07:00.520 --> 3:07:02.520]  Army PSY OPS documents that have been
[3:07:02.520 --> 3:07:04.520]  in the public domain for many years.
[3:07:04.520 --> 3:07:07.520]  And most people just don't go read these things, right?
[3:07:07.520 --> 3:07:08.520]  It's kind of amazing to me
[3:07:08.520 --> 3:07:10.520]  because you've got journalists so-called out there
[3:07:10.520 --> 3:07:13.520]  who spend all their time basically doing PR
[3:07:13.520 --> 3:07:16.520]  and basically going after people getting on the platform.
[3:07:16.520 --> 3:07:19.520]  And this shows that we hear,
[3:07:19.520 --> 3:07:22.520]  in force, people that do this kind of work
[3:07:22.520 --> 3:07:23.520]  are doing the real journalism, right?
[3:07:23.520 --> 3:07:26.520]  This is the last messages of journalism that's left
[3:07:26.520 --> 3:07:29.520]  because journalists ought to be reading these kinds of things.
[3:07:29.520 --> 3:07:31.520]  That'll be reporting on this kind of stuff,
[3:07:31.520 --> 3:07:34.520]  not reporting on and using their platforms as weapons
[3:07:34.520 --> 3:07:37.520]  to basically get rid of everybody who dissents,
[3:07:37.520 --> 3:07:42.520]  so that really they're just operatives like Winston was in 1984.
[3:07:42.520 --> 3:07:44.520]  If you remember in 1984, Winston's job
[3:07:44.520 --> 3:07:46.520]  is basically to revise history
[3:07:46.520 --> 3:07:49.520]  and to erase the memory of people that got deep-platformed.
[3:07:49.520 --> 3:07:51.520]  That's really what Winston's up to in 1984.
[3:07:51.520 --> 3:07:53.520]  Go watch the movie if you haven't read the book.
[3:07:53.520 --> 3:07:55.520]  The book's a lot better, by the way,
[3:07:55.520 --> 3:07:58.520]  but we're going to notice in this NATO PSY OPS document,
[3:07:58.520 --> 3:08:00.520]  Cognitive Warfare, The Battle for Your Brain,
[3:08:00.520 --> 3:08:04.520]  that it's actually very Orwellian.
[3:08:04.520 --> 3:08:06.520]  I know that's a cliche.
[3:08:06.520 --> 3:08:08.520]  Everybody says this over and over and over.
[3:08:08.520 --> 3:08:11.520]  We hear it ad nauseam, and that's lost meaning, right?
[3:08:11.520 --> 3:08:14.520]  The notion Orwellian has lost its force,
[3:08:14.520 --> 3:08:18.520]  but we're going to see that as this comes to fruition,
[3:08:18.520 --> 3:08:20.520]  it's not going to lose its force.
[3:08:20.520 --> 3:08:22.520]  It's going to hit us square in the head.
[3:08:22.520 --> 3:08:25.520]  So I mentioned the documents like The Mind Has No Firewall.
[3:08:25.520 --> 3:08:27.520]  There's another document I recommend,
[3:08:27.520 --> 3:08:31.520]  Psy War to Mind War by Michael Aquino,
[3:08:31.520 --> 3:08:34.520]  the famous Satanist who recently passed away,
[3:08:34.520 --> 3:08:39.520]  wrote a key document about the U.S. Army's psychological warfare operations.
[3:08:39.520 --> 3:08:42.520]  That doctrine of the Army's warfare was, again,
[3:08:42.520 --> 3:08:45.520]  written by a famous Satanist.
[3:08:45.520 --> 3:08:49.520]  Another text that you should know is Silent Weapons for Quiet Wars,
[3:08:49.520 --> 3:08:52.520]  and that deals with kind of covert warfare,
[3:08:52.520 --> 3:08:55.520]  non-lethal weapons, this kind of stuff,
[3:08:55.520 --> 3:08:58.520]  silent EMF, e-left-side technology,
[3:08:58.520 --> 3:09:01.520]  which also is mentioned by the way in the other documents I listed.
[3:09:01.520 --> 3:09:03.520]  So maybe in the future we'll get into those,
[3:09:03.520 --> 3:09:06.520]  we'll get into this NATO document which just recently leaked,
[3:09:06.520 --> 3:09:10.520]  and this is in concert with other documents and leaks
[3:09:10.520 --> 3:09:14.520]  that have been relevant and related to NATO in the last couple of years,
[3:09:14.520 --> 3:09:18.520]  namely the integrity leaks where we saw that western UK media,
[3:09:18.520 --> 3:09:21.520]  that the military, the deep state of the UK,
[3:09:21.520 --> 3:09:24.520]  was involved in a lot of PsyOps, a lot of going online,
[3:09:24.520 --> 3:09:27.520]  whole brigades, brigade 77 out of the UK,
[3:09:27.520 --> 3:09:31.520]  which is basically intent on attacking people,
[3:09:31.520 --> 3:09:33.520]  questioning the COVID story.
[3:09:33.520 --> 3:09:36.520]  And then German intelligence, there was a report that came out,
[3:09:36.520 --> 3:09:39.520]  that German intelligence was going to target people
[3:09:39.520 --> 3:09:41.520]  to question the KUFID narrative.
[3:09:41.520 --> 3:09:44.520]  If you questioned it, you're going to have PsyOps people
[3:09:44.520 --> 3:09:46.520]  tracking you and watching you.
[3:09:46.520 --> 3:09:49.520]  And we saw Biden a few months ago say the exact same thing,
[3:09:49.520 --> 3:09:53.520]  that Homeland Security and foreign contractors should be,
[3:09:53.520 --> 3:09:57.520]  basically, pimped this out to foreign contractors
[3:09:57.520 --> 3:09:58.520]  to track Americans.
[3:09:58.520 --> 3:10:01.520]  But since it's illegal for Americans to track Americans
[3:10:01.520 --> 3:10:03.520]  supposedly, even though they do that,
[3:10:03.520 --> 3:10:05.520]  well, they'll just hire some foreign entity,
[3:10:05.520 --> 3:10:08.520]  some private entity in another country to do it.
[3:10:08.520 --> 3:10:12.520]  And all of that has come out in the last few months.
[3:10:12.520 --> 3:10:16.520]  And again, particularly related to what they call disinformation
[3:10:16.520 --> 3:10:19.520]  about the KUF narrative,
[3:10:19.520 --> 3:10:22.520]  which in other words just means truth about what's going on, right?
[3:10:22.520 --> 3:10:26.520]  So shut down a track that is sent from the top down
[3:10:26.520 --> 3:10:30.520]  via these PsyOps officers and online SOC accounts
[3:10:30.520 --> 3:10:32.520]  and various techniques.
[3:10:32.520 --> 3:10:34.520]  Well, what are those techniques?
[3:10:34.520 --> 3:10:36.520]  Let's get into this NATO document.
[3:10:36.520 --> 3:10:38.520]  Western governments and the NATO military alliance
[3:10:38.520 --> 3:10:41.520]  are developing tactics of what are called cognitive warfare.
[3:10:41.520 --> 3:10:43.520]  We'll get into what that is here in a moment.
[3:10:43.520 --> 3:10:48.520]  Using the faux threats of China and Russia as the bad guy
[3:10:48.520 --> 3:10:52.520]  to justify waging a battle for your brain in the human domain.
[3:10:52.520 --> 3:10:55.520]  And this is ultimately, as it says in the document,
[3:10:55.520 --> 3:10:58.520]  you make everyone a weapon.
[3:10:58.520 --> 3:11:01.520]  And that's relevant because it reminds me of what's in the
[3:11:01.520 --> 3:11:04.520]  UK transhumanist ministry of defense document,
[3:11:04.520 --> 3:11:07.520]  which says that humans are actually no longer,
[3:11:07.520 --> 3:11:11.520]  you know, the way we used to be described in the white papers
[3:11:11.520 --> 3:11:15.520]  was as human resources, cattle, right?
[3:11:15.520 --> 3:11:20.520]  Now we are potential walking platforms,
[3:11:20.520 --> 3:11:21.520]  tech platforms.
[3:11:21.520 --> 3:11:25.520]  You're basically a little Wi-Fi emitter and receiver
[3:11:25.520 --> 3:11:28.520]  in potentia to be turned into that so they can actually
[3:11:28.520 --> 3:11:30.520]  tune into your signals.
[3:11:30.520 --> 3:11:33.520]  And they want to use signals, basically signals
[3:11:33.520 --> 3:11:40.520]  warfare, EMF, ELF, ELF, probably the 5 and 6G material
[3:11:40.520 --> 3:11:43.520]  according to Klaus, that's what it's going to be right to
[3:11:43.520 --> 3:11:45.520]  basically resonate with what's in your body.
[3:11:45.520 --> 3:11:48.520]  I suspect that that's what's going on with the various
[3:11:48.520 --> 3:11:51.520]  stabbies, that what's in the stabbies is the,
[3:11:51.520 --> 3:11:54.520]  you know, the graphene, the various nanotech materials
[3:11:54.520 --> 3:11:57.520]  which do relate to the tracking and tracing.
[3:11:57.520 --> 3:12:00.520]  Now they do this stupid game, play this game where they say,
[3:12:00.520 --> 3:12:03.520]  you can't fit a microchip into a syringe.
[3:12:03.520 --> 3:12:06.520]  There's no microchip in the syringe.
[3:12:06.520 --> 3:12:07.520]  No, it's just smart blood.
[3:12:07.520 --> 3:12:12.520]  It's just a nanotech technology that is going to be
[3:12:12.520 --> 3:12:16.520]  tracking you and keeping up with you and taking care of your
[3:12:16.520 --> 3:12:19.520]  health via your blood.
[3:12:19.520 --> 3:12:22.520]  And if you missed it by the way this last week,
[3:12:22.520 --> 3:12:24.520]  I covered in depth James Bond.
[3:12:24.520 --> 3:12:27.520]  And if you recall, inspector, there was a specific
[3:12:27.520 --> 3:12:30.520]  scene inspector where James Bond goes under,
[3:12:30.520 --> 3:12:32.520]  you know, he's in the underground base and he's talking
[3:12:32.520 --> 3:12:36.520]  to Q and Q references the smart blood that they've
[3:12:36.520 --> 3:12:39.520]  injected into Bond to take care of his health to make
[3:12:39.520 --> 3:12:42.520]  sure he's doing well and make sure he's in the field
[3:12:42.520 --> 3:12:43.520]  and he's not hurt.
[3:12:43.520 --> 3:12:46.520]  The smart blood can track and trace and tell his heart
[3:12:46.520 --> 3:12:47.520]  rate, et cetera.
[3:12:47.520 --> 3:12:50.520]  That's exactly what's in the CBS report,
[3:12:50.520 --> 3:12:53.520]  the 60 minutes report from a couple months ago where they
[3:12:53.520 --> 3:12:56.520]  did an interview with the people from DARPA talking about
[3:12:56.520 --> 3:12:58.520]  nanotech in your blood.
[3:12:58.520 --> 3:13:00.520]  That's what's in, by the way, it's going to be
[3:13:00.520 --> 3:13:02.520]  discussed in this NATO document.
[3:13:02.520 --> 3:13:05.520]  That's what's in the UK Ministry of Defense document is
[3:13:05.520 --> 3:13:08.520]  that they're going to, under the guise of humans as
[3:13:08.520 --> 3:13:13.520]  human platforms mandate, the UK Ministry of Defense
[3:13:13.520 --> 3:13:15.520]  document says they will mandate it.
[3:13:15.520 --> 3:13:18.520]  Just like all the mandates that we've heard in the last
[3:13:18.520 --> 3:13:20.520]  couple of years, it's not law, it's just mandate.
[3:13:20.520 --> 3:13:22.520]  The government's just going to say, you got to do this.
[3:13:22.520 --> 3:13:27.520]  It says that human platforms will be mandated to be
[3:13:27.520 --> 3:13:29.520]  chipped, to be tracked and traced.
[3:13:29.520 --> 3:13:31.520]  They're going to invade your biology.
[3:13:31.520 --> 3:13:33.520]  That's exactly what Klaus says.
[3:13:33.520 --> 3:13:35.520]  So look, between NATO's documents,
[3:13:35.520 --> 3:13:38.520]  between the Psi House documents from 20 years ago of Michael
[3:13:38.520 --> 3:13:42.520]  Aquino, which talks about EMF, ELF frequencies, right,
[3:13:42.520 --> 3:13:45.520]  and geoengineering the atmosphere that's actually in the
[3:13:45.520 --> 3:13:48.520]  footnotes of his mind war to Psi War, Psi War to
[3:13:48.520 --> 3:13:50.520]  Mind War, excuse me.
[3:13:50.520 --> 3:13:52.520]  There's a coordinated plan.
[3:13:52.520 --> 3:13:55.520]  These are not disparate entities that don't know what the
[3:13:55.520 --> 3:13:57.520]  other arm is saying you're doing.
[3:13:57.520 --> 3:14:00.520]  At this level, the plan is coordinated.
[3:14:00.520 --> 3:14:02.520]  And that's why they all say the same thing.
[3:14:02.520 --> 3:14:05.520]  And that's why they all say what the global elite of the
[3:14:05.520 --> 3:14:08.520]  last 50 years have said in the last 100 years, right?
[3:14:08.520 --> 3:14:10.520]  I've covered 50 plus of their books.
[3:14:10.520 --> 3:14:12.520]  And they all say the same thing.
[3:14:12.520 --> 3:14:14.520]  Now they might differ on the minutiae of how to get this
[3:14:14.520 --> 3:14:19.520]  agenda done, but the plan is the same across the board.
[3:14:19.520 --> 3:14:22.520]  And so I get on here and I read all these documents for you.
[3:14:22.520 --> 3:14:24.520]  I'm the nerd that does your homework for you.
[3:14:24.520 --> 3:14:25.520]  I do your homework, right?
[3:14:25.520 --> 3:14:26.520]  You come to me.
[3:14:26.520 --> 3:14:29.520]  I'm the Chad nerd in class that does your homework.
[3:14:29.520 --> 3:14:32.520]  And if you don't pay me, right?
[3:14:32.520 --> 3:14:33.520]  You owe me.
[3:14:33.520 --> 3:14:34.520]  You owe me.
[3:14:34.520 --> 3:14:35.520]  You owe me your tater tots.
[3:14:35.520 --> 3:14:38.520]  If you don't pay me and tater tots, you're going to get beat
[3:14:38.520 --> 3:14:39.520]  up after recess, right?
[3:14:39.520 --> 3:14:42.520]  So I do your homework for you, but you better pay me for doing
[3:14:42.520 --> 3:14:43.520]  homework.
[3:14:43.520 --> 3:14:47.520]  And so let's take these tater tot nuggets of truth here and
[3:14:47.520 --> 3:14:49.520]  put them in your pocket for later on, right?
[3:14:49.520 --> 3:14:51.520]  Because you got to know this stuff.
[3:14:51.520 --> 3:14:52.520]  You got to know this information.
[3:14:52.520 --> 3:14:54.520]  Platformed humans.
[3:14:54.520 --> 3:14:57.520]  Humans are the platforms by which psychological warfare can
[3:14:57.520 --> 3:15:02.520]  be conducted to make humans themselves weaponized.
[3:15:02.520 --> 3:15:05.520]  Now, this document focuses on the psychological warfare
[3:15:05.520 --> 3:15:06.520]  component.
[3:15:06.520 --> 3:15:09.520]  The UK document focuses on the tech side of it, right?
[3:15:09.520 --> 3:15:11.520]  The DARPA transhumanist stuff.
[3:15:11.520 --> 3:15:14.520]  But what do they want to do when they make us into platforms?
[3:15:14.520 --> 3:15:18.520]  Well, they want to change the way that we think.
[3:15:18.520 --> 3:15:21.520]  You think, okay, well, isn't that what, you know, social
[3:15:21.520 --> 3:15:22.520]  engineering startups does?
[3:15:22.520 --> 3:15:23.520]  It changes the way we think.
[3:15:23.520 --> 3:15:24.520]  No, no.
[3:15:24.520 --> 3:15:28.520]  Changing the way you think, as the document says, by changing
[3:15:28.520 --> 3:15:31.520]  the brain itself.
[3:15:31.520 --> 3:15:32.520]  Exactly what Klaus said.
[3:15:32.520 --> 3:15:34.520]  We're going to get in your biology.
[3:15:34.520 --> 3:15:37.520]  We're going to get in your head, literally in your head,
[3:15:37.520 --> 3:15:40.520]  through implantables, through neural link, through all of
[3:15:40.520 --> 3:15:42.520]  these kinds of things, which are coming.
[3:15:42.520 --> 3:15:43.520]  Don't go anywhere.
[3:15:43.520 --> 3:15:44.520]  Stay right there.
[3:15:44.520 --> 3:15:46.520]  What if you could cut your heating bills this winter with
[3:15:46.520 --> 3:15:48.520]  your existing wood-burning fireplace and not spend
[3:15:48.520 --> 3:15:49.520]  thousands doing it?
[3:15:49.520 --> 3:15:52.520]  You can with Great Wall of Fire fireplace grates.

[3:16:13.520 --> 3:16:14.520]  Hey, everybody.
[3:16:14.520 --> 3:16:17.520]  Confused about staying healthy in a crazy COVID culture?
[3:16:17.520 --> 3:16:18.520]  Me, too.
[3:16:18.520 --> 3:16:21.520]  But listen, after all the research, all the conflicting
[3:16:21.520 --> 3:16:24.520]  studies, after all the squabbling, there's one thing
[3:16:24.520 --> 3:16:25.520]  almost everyone agrees on.
[3:16:25.520 --> 3:16:28.520]  It's that immune system health can literally be the
[3:16:28.520 --> 3:16:30.520]  difference between life and death.
[3:16:30.520 --> 3:16:32.520]  You probably already believe that.
[3:16:32.520 --> 3:16:33.520]  I certainly do.
[3:16:33.520 --> 3:16:34.520]  So here's the thing.
[3:16:34.520 --> 3:16:36.520]  I wanted to get past the craziness and find out which
[3:16:36.520 --> 3:16:39.520]  plant-based substances actually have studies that
[3:16:39.520 --> 3:16:42.520]  demonstrate some efficacy in immune support.
[3:16:42.520 --> 3:16:45.520]  Now, you'll have to sign a waiver, but you can check out
[3:16:45.520 --> 3:16:48.520]  what I've discovered at strongerdefense.com.
[3:16:48.520 --> 3:16:49.520]  No cures or treatments there.
[3:16:49.520 --> 3:16:52.520]  Instead, little-known but shocking immune system
[3:16:52.520 --> 3:16:55.520]  research and a breakthrough immune support product based
[3:16:55.520 --> 3:16:58.520]  on that research called Immune 10x.

[3:17:13.520 --> 3:17:14.520]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[3:17:14.520 --> 3:17:17.520]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they
[3:17:17.520 --> 3:17:18.520]  tried to seize my mother's house.
[3:17:18.520 --> 3:17:20.520]  I sued the IRS in one.
[3:17:20.520 --> 3:17:23.520]  I beat the IRS then, and I've been beating them ever since.
[3:17:23.520 --> 3:17:25.520]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement, and I've helped
[3:17:25.520 --> 3:17:27.520]  thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought
[3:17:27.520 --> 3:17:28.520]  might never be solved.
[3:17:28.520 --> 3:17:30.520]  I can help you, too.
[3:17:30.520 --> 3:17:33.520]  If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day.
[3:17:33.520 --> 3:17:35.520]  There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case.

[3:17:44.520 --> 3:17:47.520]  I'm taking this message on the morning of Tuesday
[3:17:47.520 --> 3:17:52.520]  October 19th, 2021, and I've got some great news to report
[3:17:52.520 --> 3:17:53.520]  to the listeners.
[3:17:53.520 --> 3:17:56.520]  For at least one week, we're going to be able to run a sale
[3:17:56.520 --> 3:17:59.520]  with Bobby E.'s ultimate turmeric formula that just got
[3:17:59.520 --> 3:18:02.520]  back in stock after being sold out almost five months
[3:18:02.520 --> 3:18:04.520]  because of supply chain breakdowns.
[3:18:04.520 --> 3:18:08.520]  It has a 95% curcuminoid level.
[3:18:08.520 --> 3:18:11.520]  Most of the turmeric supplements have a 5% to 10%
[3:18:11.520 --> 3:18:12.520]  curcuminoid level.
[3:18:12.520 --> 3:18:16.520]  Our leading competitor has a 75% curcuminoid level.
[3:18:16.520 --> 3:18:19.520]  This is a special proprietary concentrate.
[3:18:19.520 --> 3:18:22.520]  It is so good for information for your immune system.
[3:18:22.520 --> 3:18:24.520]  It's an antioxidant for your whole body.
[3:18:24.520 --> 3:18:25.520]  It's documented.
[3:18:25.520 --> 3:18:27.520]  It's amazing.
[3:18:27.520 --> 3:18:29.520]  Everybody knows that turmeric is an incredible thing that
[3:18:29.520 --> 3:18:32.520]  God created, and bodies is the strongest and best.
[3:18:32.520 --> 3:18:34.520]  You're going to find, and it's back in stock,
[3:18:34.520 --> 3:18:36.520]  and it funds the InfoWare.
[3:18:36.520 --> 3:18:38.520]  40% off for a limited time.
[3:18:38.520 --> 3:18:40.520]  That goes back to regular price right now.
[3:18:40.520 --> 3:18:41.520]  InfoWareStore.com.
[3:18:41.520 --> 3:18:44.520]  We're running this special for one week.
[3:18:44.520 --> 3:18:46.520]  I'm sitting here.
[3:18:46.520 --> 3:18:48.520]  It's in the early morning hours,
[3:18:48.520 --> 3:18:52.520]  and I'm looking at mainstream news,
[3:18:52.520 --> 3:18:55.520]  reporting on the fact that even the controlled revolving door
[3:18:55.520 --> 3:18:59.520]  FDA has come out and said that the Moderna and Pfizer shots
[3:18:59.520 --> 3:19:02.520]  need to be held up and not authorized for children
[3:19:02.520 --> 3:19:04.520]  because in studies they did on children,
[3:19:04.520 --> 3:19:05.520]  it caused myocarditis.
[3:19:05.520 --> 3:19:08.520]  That's heart swelling and heart attacks.
[3:19:08.520 --> 3:19:10.520]  And then I noticed that even though this is even
[3:19:10.520 --> 3:19:13.520]  in the Associated Press, it's not getting any circulation.
[3:19:13.520 --> 3:19:15.520]  It's not on the national news, and it's very hard to even
[3:19:15.520 --> 3:19:17.520]  find on places like Instagram or Twitter.
[3:19:17.520 --> 3:19:18.520]  It's just crazy.
[3:19:18.520 --> 3:19:21.520]  And then, Fauci was on TV just yesterday
[3:19:21.520 --> 3:19:23.520]  saying there's no damage from the vaccines.
[3:19:23.520 --> 3:19:25.520]  It doesn't hurt anybody.
[3:19:25.520 --> 3:19:27.520]  You're a conspiracy theorist if you say it.
[3:19:27.520 --> 3:19:28.520]  It's just crazy.
[3:19:28.520 --> 3:19:30.520]  And then we have all the scientists who over a year ago
[3:19:30.520 --> 3:19:32.520]  came out and said these vaccines are going to cause
[3:19:32.520 --> 3:19:34.520]  heart problems, and they gave the exact reasons
[3:19:34.520 --> 3:19:36.520]  why and now it happened.
[3:19:36.520 --> 3:19:38.520]  That's why InfoWare is on air.
[3:19:38.520 --> 3:19:40.520]  Because if we weren't on air, they'd get away with
[3:19:40.520 --> 3:19:41.520]  even more of this crap.
[3:19:41.520 --> 3:19:43.520]  This is just insane.
[3:19:43.520 --> 3:19:45.520]  These people are killers.
[3:19:47.520 --> 3:19:50.520]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[3:20:04.520 --> 3:20:06.520]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[3:20:06.520 --> 3:20:09.520]  I'm your guest host, Jay Dyer of Jay's Analysis.
[3:20:09.520 --> 3:20:11.520]  We're talking about the NATO Psychological
[3:20:11.520 --> 3:20:14.520]  Warfare document that has appeared online
[3:20:14.520 --> 3:20:16.520]  that a lot of people are making a big deal about.
[3:20:16.520 --> 3:20:19.520]  And it should be a big deal because it's, again,
[3:20:19.520 --> 3:20:23.520]  one of a long train of psychological warfare documents
[3:20:23.520 --> 3:20:26.520]  that explain and demonstrate exactly how the system
[3:20:26.520 --> 3:20:28.520]  at a high level works.
[3:20:28.520 --> 3:20:31.520]  And to really understand the overall global league plan,
[3:20:31.520 --> 3:20:33.520]  there's no way to do it other than to go into
[3:20:33.520 --> 3:20:35.520]  these documents themselves.
[3:20:35.520 --> 3:20:38.520]  Other than going into the writings of the elite
[3:20:38.520 --> 3:20:40.520]  over the last 100, 200 years.
[3:20:40.520 --> 3:20:43.520]  And in this document, this white paper we have,
[3:20:43.520 --> 3:20:46.520]  not so much the tech angle, although it does conclude
[3:20:46.520 --> 3:20:49.520]  with a lot of tech plans and DARPA plans,
[3:20:49.520 --> 3:20:52.520]  it is NATO's attitude towards cognitive warfare,
[3:20:52.520 --> 3:20:55.520]  the new way of doing warfare online.
[3:20:55.520 --> 3:20:57.520]  And this includes the alteration,
[3:20:57.520 --> 3:20:59.520]  not just the thinking processes,
[3:20:59.520 --> 3:21:01.520]  but the changing of the brain itself,
[3:21:01.520 --> 3:21:04.520]  the actual biological, right, human
[3:21:04.520 --> 3:21:07.520]  being converted into a new type of being.
[3:21:07.520 --> 3:21:10.520]  It goes on to talk about our new plan, right,
[3:21:10.520 --> 3:21:14.520]  is to continue the notion of full spectrum dominance
[3:21:14.520 --> 3:21:16.520]  and hybrid warfare.
[3:21:16.520 --> 3:21:17.520]  If you don't know what hybrid warfare,
[3:21:17.520 --> 3:21:18.520]  you can go to my channel.
[3:21:18.520 --> 3:21:20.520]  I did an interview a couple of years ago
[3:21:20.520 --> 3:21:23.520]  with a prominent analyst named Andrew Karibco.
[3:21:23.520 --> 3:21:26.520]  And we did a whole interview on his book
[3:21:26.520 --> 3:21:29.520]  about hybrid warfare, which gives a detailed account
[3:21:29.520 --> 3:21:32.520]  of what this is in order to understand this NATO mindset.
[3:21:32.520 --> 3:21:34.520]  And as you go through this document,
[3:21:34.520 --> 3:21:39.520]  we see that this includes self-declared adversaries
[3:21:40.520 --> 3:21:42.520]  attacking through economic warfare,
[3:21:42.520 --> 3:21:44.520]  attacking through cyber warfare,
[3:21:44.520 --> 3:21:46.520]  information warfare, and psychological warfare.
[3:21:46.520 --> 3:21:49.520]  And now the new added element,
[3:21:49.520 --> 3:21:51.520]  hacking the individual by exploiting
[3:21:51.520 --> 3:21:54.520]  the vulnerabilities of the human brain.
[3:21:54.520 --> 3:21:55.520]  And again, it reminds me of the
[3:21:55.520 --> 3:21:58.520]  mind has no firewall document from 20 or so years ago,
[3:21:58.520 --> 3:22:01.520]  which is basically saying the same types of thing
[3:22:01.520 --> 3:22:04.520]  from the Army War College, if I recall.
[3:22:04.520 --> 3:22:06.520]  And it says that until recently NATO
[3:22:06.520 --> 3:22:11.520]  had only viewed warfare as air, land, sea, space, and cyber.
[3:22:11.520 --> 3:22:14.520]  And now the new domain is the human domain of the mind.
[3:22:14.520 --> 3:22:16.520]  Now this doesn't mean they never knew about Info War.
[3:22:16.520 --> 3:22:18.520]  Of course they did.
[3:22:18.520 --> 3:22:20.520]  Various governments and power blocks,
[3:22:20.520 --> 3:22:23.520]  they do Info War online all the time.
[3:22:23.520 --> 3:22:25.520]  I mean, we're watching Info Wars right now.
[3:22:25.520 --> 3:22:28.520]  We're participating in that from the vantage point of truth
[3:22:28.520 --> 3:22:31.520]  and the vantage point of what is God-centered, right?
[3:22:31.520 --> 3:22:35.520]  What really ought to be the worldview of the paradigm
[3:22:35.520 --> 3:22:38.520]  as opposed to tyranny, as opposed to globalism,
[3:22:38.520 --> 3:22:40.520]  as opposed to technocracy.
[3:22:40.520 --> 3:22:42.520]  This new form of warfare, it says,
[3:22:42.520 --> 3:22:45.520]  with this fifth domain is defined by cognitive warfare,
[3:22:45.520 --> 3:22:50.520]  which seeks to make everyone a weapon.
[3:22:50.520 --> 3:22:52.520]  Now, why would they want to make everyone a weapon,
[3:22:52.520 --> 3:22:54.520]  including their domestic population?
[3:22:54.520 --> 3:22:57.520]  And it says, well, I'm not joking.
[3:22:57.520 --> 3:23:00.520]  It actually says, because you might actually be
[3:23:00.520 --> 3:23:03.520]  an enemy without knowing it.
[3:23:03.520 --> 3:23:06.520]  You might actually be an asymptomatic carrier
[3:23:06.520 --> 3:23:08.520]  without knowing it.
[3:23:08.520 --> 3:23:10.520]  No one else knows this, but trust us,
[3:23:10.520 --> 3:23:13.520]  this gadget that we've cooked like Theranos,
[3:23:13.520 --> 3:23:16.520]  this PCR, oh, this tells you that you're carrying this,
[3:23:16.520 --> 3:23:18.520]  even if you don't know that, right?
[3:23:18.520 --> 3:23:20.520]  It's a scam, basically.
[3:23:20.520 --> 3:23:23.520]  And it's basically what I've said for a long time,
[3:23:23.520 --> 3:23:25.520]  is that all the techniques of psychological warfare
[3:23:25.520 --> 3:23:27.520]  and manipulation out of wartime
[3:23:27.520 --> 3:23:30.520]  eventually get turned on the domestic population.
[3:23:30.520 --> 3:23:33.520]  When you get a degenerate corrupt elite,
[3:23:33.520 --> 3:23:36.520]  an oligarchy that runs your country or runs the western world
[3:23:36.520 --> 3:23:39.520]  or runs what's basically coming into fruition,
[3:23:39.520 --> 3:23:43.520]  they take that that they use during the two world wars,
[3:23:43.520 --> 3:23:45.520]  all the research, all the psychological warfare,
[3:23:45.520 --> 3:23:47.520]  and the Cold War, and they turn it
[3:23:47.520 --> 3:23:49.520]  on the population domestically.
[3:23:49.520 --> 3:23:52.520]  Because it's not a battle of nation states
[3:23:52.520 --> 3:23:54.520]  at the highest level.
[3:23:54.520 --> 3:23:59.520]  It's an international elite that wants to destroy family,
[3:23:59.520 --> 3:24:02.520]  nation, God, all of that, right?
[3:24:02.520 --> 3:24:05.520]  All those older firewalls that would keep them
[3:24:05.520 --> 3:24:07.520]  from having total control.
[3:24:07.520 --> 3:24:11.520]  And in fact, this document is actually about total control,
[3:24:11.520 --> 3:24:13.520]  mastering the human domain.
[3:24:13.520 --> 3:24:15.520]  They even referenced this later on.
[3:24:15.520 --> 3:24:18.520]  And if you recall, that was a Pentagon thing
[3:24:18.520 --> 3:24:21.520]  that was mentioned, I think, back at the time of Jade Helm, right?
[3:24:21.520 --> 3:24:24.520]  8, 10 years ago when all the Jade Helm style was going on,
[3:24:24.520 --> 3:24:27.520]  you had reference to the document that came out,
[3:24:27.520 --> 3:24:29.520]  mastering the human domain.
[3:24:29.520 --> 3:24:31.520]  If I'm going for memory, that was an Air Force document
[3:24:31.520 --> 3:24:33.520]  that dealt with every area of life being controlled.
[3:24:33.520 --> 3:24:35.520]  That's exactly what this is.
[3:24:35.520 --> 3:24:37.520]  So it's basically the same thing, right?
[3:24:37.520 --> 3:24:39.520]  Cognitive warfare.
[3:24:39.520 --> 3:24:42.520]  So the brain is the battlefield of the 21st century.
[3:24:42.520 --> 3:24:44.520]  Humans are the contested domain,
[3:24:44.520 --> 3:24:47.520]  and future conflicts will likely occur amongst people
[3:24:47.520 --> 3:24:49.520]  digitally first and physically thereafter
[3:24:49.520 --> 3:24:52.520]  in proximity to the hubs of political and economic power.
[3:24:52.520 --> 3:24:57.520]  The vulnerability is precisely the human mind.
[3:24:57.520 --> 3:24:59.520]  So how is the human mind vulnerable?
[3:24:59.520 --> 3:25:02.520]  Well, it says that what has to happen here
[3:25:02.520 --> 3:25:05.520]  is that we're going to have to weaponize cognitive warfare
[3:25:05.520 --> 3:25:08.520]  to the extent that we don't just go after
[3:25:08.520 --> 3:25:10.520]  or target individuals in the sense of
[3:25:10.520 --> 3:25:12.520]  those who might pose a threat.
[3:25:12.520 --> 3:25:13.520]  And who poses the threat?
[3:25:13.520 --> 3:25:15.520]  Well, it's their determination,
[3:25:15.520 --> 3:25:18.520]  and it's anybody who might be unknowingly susceptible
[3:25:18.520 --> 3:25:20.520]  to foreign disinformation.
[3:25:20.520 --> 3:25:22.520]  So they're just going to say,
[3:25:22.520 --> 3:25:24.520]  well, we've determined you're a Russian bot.
[3:25:24.520 --> 3:25:26.520]  Oh, we've determined that you are a foreign asset.
[3:25:26.520 --> 3:25:28.520]  Well, what's the evidence?
[3:25:28.520 --> 3:25:30.520]  Well, because you're saying true things.
[3:25:30.520 --> 3:25:33.520]  We saw this basically in the last four years of Russia.
[3:25:33.520 --> 3:25:36.520]  The whole Russiagate thing is basically an example of this, right?
[3:25:36.520 --> 3:25:39.520]  Well, there's not actually evidence that you're a foreign agent,
[3:25:39.520 --> 3:25:41.520]  but we're just going to say that you are
[3:25:41.520 --> 3:25:43.520]  because you're saying things that are true
[3:25:43.520 --> 3:25:45.520]  and damage the existing power structure.
[3:25:45.520 --> 3:25:47.520]  And they say that we're going to have to weaponize
[3:25:47.520 --> 3:25:50.520]  social sciences along with academics.
[3:25:50.520 --> 3:25:53.520]  How long have I been telling you that the key enemy,
[3:25:53.520 --> 3:25:56.520]  the worst human beings in America are the academics?
[3:25:56.520 --> 3:25:59.520]  Because they are the ones that foster,
[3:25:59.520 --> 3:26:01.520]  as the so-called intellectual class,
[3:26:01.520 --> 3:26:04.520]  all the baloney upon the last few generations
[3:26:04.520 --> 3:26:05.520]  of your offspring.
[3:26:05.520 --> 3:26:08.520]  When you send your offspring to these state universities,
[3:26:08.520 --> 3:26:11.520]  they're there to be brainwashed by these neoliberal Marxists.
[3:26:11.520 --> 3:26:12.520]  I know that doesn't make sense.
[3:26:12.520 --> 3:26:13.520]  How can you have a neoliberal Marxist?
[3:26:13.520 --> 3:26:15.520]  But that's what they are.
[3:26:15.520 --> 3:26:17.520]  They're Marxist professors.
[3:26:17.520 --> 3:26:19.520]  I've dealt with them for 10 years.
[3:26:19.520 --> 3:26:21.520]  They are the worst people out there.
[3:26:21.520 --> 3:26:26.520]  And that's who is out there fomenting their change agents, right?
[3:26:26.520 --> 3:26:28.520]  You've heard this terminology.
[3:26:28.520 --> 3:26:31.520]  And some of them are dumb enough to believe Marxism.
[3:26:31.520 --> 3:26:33.520]  And some of them don't even believe it or don't believe
[3:26:33.520 --> 3:26:36.520]  that the socialism, the collective, whatever they're promoting.
[3:26:36.520 --> 3:26:39.520]  And some of them are also so-called right-wing libertarians.
[3:26:39.520 --> 3:26:42.520]  So I'm not just going after so-called communists.
[3:26:42.520 --> 3:26:48.520]  The intellectual class is just bereft of any virtue.
[3:26:48.520 --> 3:26:52.520]  They're all basically there to destroy the existing structure,
[3:26:52.520 --> 3:26:54.520]  implode from within.
[3:26:54.520 --> 3:26:56.520]  And this document is actually saying,
[3:26:56.520 --> 3:27:00.520]  we're going to have to work with weaponized academia.
[3:27:00.520 --> 3:27:03.520]  I mean, they've already weaponized academia for decades, right?
[3:27:03.520 --> 3:27:05.520]  I mean, it was the OSS that actually brought over
[3:27:05.520 --> 3:27:08.520]  the Frankfurt School of Critical Theorists.
[3:27:08.520 --> 3:27:10.520]  I mean, this is Foreign Affairs Magazine,
[3:27:10.520 --> 3:27:13.520]  and the books written on this is well-known, right?
[3:27:13.520 --> 3:27:15.520]  And Bertrand Russell, Rockefeller Foundation,
[3:27:15.520 --> 3:27:16.520]  they are the ones that said,
[3:27:16.520 --> 3:27:19.520]  let's bring the Marxist Critical Theorists over to the West
[3:27:19.520 --> 3:27:21.520]  to weaponize academia.
[3:27:21.520 --> 3:27:22.520]  So this is not new.
[3:27:22.520 --> 3:27:23.520]  This has been going on for a long time.
[3:27:23.520 --> 3:27:26.520]  We also, it says, must weaponize human sciences
[3:27:26.520 --> 3:27:31.520]  to develop this cognitive warfare capacity.
[3:27:31.520 --> 3:27:35.520]  This results in what they call the militarization of brain science.
[3:27:35.520 --> 3:27:37.520]  Thus, NATO's development of cognitive warfare
[3:27:37.520 --> 3:27:41.520]  is the militarization of every area of society,
[3:27:41.520 --> 3:27:43.520]  the mastering of the human domain,
[3:27:43.520 --> 3:27:45.520]  which includes the human mind.
[3:27:45.520 --> 3:27:49.520]  Then it goes on to say that if anyone disagrees with this,
[3:27:49.520 --> 3:27:51.520]  you just say that they are part of a fifth column
[3:27:51.520 --> 3:27:53.520]  and that they're foreign agents.
[3:27:53.520 --> 3:27:55.520]  It doesn't matter if it's true, just say it.
[3:27:55.520 --> 3:27:57.520]  Just say, oh, are you saying anything true?
[3:27:57.520 --> 3:27:58.520]  Oh, you must be a foreign asset.
[3:27:58.520 --> 3:28:00.520]  You must be a foreign agent.
[3:28:00.520 --> 3:28:03.520]  And this is, again, part of the hybrid warfare document,
[3:28:03.520 --> 3:28:06.520]  which is a technology of social engineering, social control.
[3:28:06.520 --> 3:28:09.520]  And they actually give, one of the examples it's given here
[3:28:09.520 --> 3:28:13.520]  is the Canadian military working with NATO
[3:28:13.520 --> 3:28:17.520]  to use psychological warfare to scare the crap out of the Canadian civilians
[3:28:17.520 --> 3:28:20.520]  in the last KUFID pandemic nonsense.
[3:28:20.520 --> 3:28:22.520]  That was all just hyped up.
[3:28:22.520 --> 3:28:24.520]  And we've been, again, Alex was talking about this all week.
[3:28:24.520 --> 3:28:26.520]  And this document is basically pointing out
[3:28:26.520 --> 3:28:29.520]  that this is a Canadian psychological warfare operation.
[3:28:29.520 --> 3:28:31.520]  And this plan of cognitive warfare
[3:28:31.520 --> 3:28:34.520]  is what they were doing, what was going on there.
[3:28:34.520 --> 3:28:38.520]  So this is, when you see the media rolling out their lives,
[3:28:38.520 --> 3:28:40.520]  it's this, it's cognitive warfare.
[3:28:40.520 --> 3:28:42.520]  This is J. Dyer, this is Alex Jones.
[3:28:42.520 --> 3:28:44.520]  Don't go anywhere. Stay where you are.
[3:28:44.520 --> 3:28:46.520]  You know, listeners call into the cell when they thank me,
[3:28:46.520 --> 3:28:50.520]  and it makes me feel pathetic because I sit there
[3:28:50.520 --> 3:28:53.520]  and I beg you for support constantly for prayer,
[3:28:53.520 --> 3:28:56.520]  for financial support, and for word of mouth.
[3:28:56.520 --> 3:28:58.520]  And we're all in this together.
[3:28:58.520 --> 3:29:00.520]  And it gets old having to come to you and say,
[3:29:00.520 --> 3:29:02.520]  hey, I got great products, please buy them,
[3:29:02.520 --> 3:29:03.520]  or we won't be here on air.
[3:29:03.520 --> 3:29:04.520]  But it's true.
[3:29:04.520 --> 3:29:06.520]  We're the only media organization in the United States
[3:29:06.520 --> 3:29:08.520]  that promotes liberty at this level
[3:29:08.520 --> 3:29:10.520]  that is not beholden to big corporate sponsors.
[3:29:10.520 --> 3:29:12.520]  And they've harassed and almost shut down everybody else.
[3:29:12.520 --> 3:29:14.520]  They crippled all the other groups.
[3:29:14.520 --> 3:29:15.520]  And we're still here.
[3:29:15.520 --> 3:29:18.520]  And as this whole new world order comes out in the open,
[3:29:18.520 --> 3:29:19.520]  our credibility's going up.
[3:29:19.520 --> 3:29:21.520]  That's why we've got to be taken off air.
[3:29:21.520 --> 3:29:23.520]  That's why America has got to be taken down.
[3:29:23.520 --> 3:29:25.520]  You can't have all these other nations enslaved,
[3:29:25.520 --> 3:29:27.520]  and America's still quasi-free.
[3:29:27.520 --> 3:29:29.520]  You can't have Info Wars has been proven right
[3:29:29.520 --> 3:29:32.520]  being on air with all the craziness that's about to unfold.
[3:29:32.520 --> 3:29:34.520]  Because if you think stuff's bad now, just get ready.
[3:29:34.520 --> 3:29:35.520]  So thank you all.
[3:29:35.520 --> 3:29:37.520]  And get an infowarstore.com.
[3:29:37.520 --> 3:29:39.520]  Get some great 2020 election shirts.
[3:29:39.520 --> 3:29:40.520]  Supplements them so much more.
[3:29:40.520 --> 3:29:41.520]  They're wonderful products.
[3:29:41.520 --> 3:29:42.520]  And they support the Info War.
[3:29:42.520 --> 3:29:43.520]  Thank you.
[3:29:46.520 --> 3:29:51.520]  If you only knew the power of the dark side,
[3:29:51.520 --> 3:29:53.520]  join Bill Gates.
[3:29:53.520 --> 3:29:58.520]  And together, we will defeat humanity.
[3:29:58.520 --> 3:30:04.520]  Then our gods will reward us with eternal life.
[3:30:04.520 --> 3:30:08.520]  That's basically the ethos of the globalists.
[3:30:08.520 --> 3:30:10.520]  They must first play God.
[3:30:10.520 --> 3:30:14.520]  They must first prove that they are the fittest
[3:30:14.520 --> 3:30:16.520]  in their social Darwinistic system.
[3:30:16.520 --> 3:30:18.520]  And in a way, they're right.
[3:30:18.520 --> 3:30:21.520]  If we let them lie to us and dumb us down and poison us
[3:30:21.520 --> 3:30:24.520]  and destroy our children's futures,
[3:30:24.520 --> 3:30:26.520]  and the evidence is overwhelming and out in the open,
[3:30:26.520 --> 3:30:29.520]  we really deserve what's happened to us.
[3:30:29.520 --> 3:30:33.520]  So I ask you now, are you going to step up
[3:30:33.520 --> 3:30:36.520]  and expose the new order even more?
[3:30:36.520 --> 3:30:39.520]  I know I'm pledging to step up and redouble my efforts.
[3:30:39.520 --> 3:31:07.520]  The front lines of the fight is infowars.com.
[3:31:09.520 --> 3:31:13.520]  All viewers and all listeners tell everybody they know about the show
[3:31:13.520 --> 3:31:16.520]  because people are ready to wake up and ready to hear the truth.
[3:31:16.520 --> 3:31:18.520]  So we've got an information warfare of the enemy
[3:31:18.520 --> 3:31:19.520]  and trying to stop their agenda.
[3:31:19.520 --> 3:31:21.520]  And we've also got to get personally prepared.
[3:31:21.520 --> 3:31:23.520]  And one of the number one things to do is high quality,
[3:31:23.520 --> 3:31:24.520]  storeable food.
[3:31:24.520 --> 3:31:27.520]  We've got the best food, ready to ship at very affordable prices
[3:31:27.520 --> 3:31:29.520]  at infowarstore.com.

[3:31:34.520 --> 3:31:37.520]  Lock your orders in before food prices go up
[3:31:37.520 --> 3:31:39.520]  and before there are long lines and waits.
[3:31:39.520 --> 3:31:41.520]  Because believe me, serious times are coming.
[3:31:41.520 --> 3:32:10.520]  Get ready at infowarstore.com.
[3:32:11.520 --> 3:32:18.520]  And so the information we cover exposes their evil works
[3:32:18.520 --> 3:32:21.520]  and sabotages their globalist takeover.
[3:32:21.520 --> 3:32:23.520]  And we're having an incredible effect thanks to your support
[3:32:23.520 --> 3:32:25.520]  and your word of mouth.
[3:32:25.520 --> 3:32:28.520]  But it's also important to take care of our bodies themselves

[3:32:46.520 --> 3:33:04.520]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:33:04.520 --> 3:33:06.520]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show.
[3:33:06.520 --> 3:33:08.520]  This is Jay Dyer of Jay's Analysis.
[3:33:08.520 --> 3:33:10.520]  And we're getting into the NATO PsyOps document.
[3:33:10.520 --> 3:33:12.520]  We're dissecting it point by point.
[3:33:12.520 --> 3:33:17.520]  And we just covered the section where it mentions the parallel
[3:33:17.520 --> 3:33:21.520]  and cooperative operations with the Canadian military
[3:33:21.520 --> 3:33:25.520]  and using these kinds of techniques to scare the Canadian
[3:33:25.520 --> 3:33:28.520]  citizenship into the stabbies.
[3:33:28.520 --> 3:33:32.520]  In fact, it even mentions the challenges and the risk,
[3:33:32.520 --> 3:33:37.520]  the rewards. If you come get a stabby,
[3:33:37.520 --> 3:33:39.520]  we'll give you cash, this kind of stuff.
[3:33:39.520 --> 3:33:45.520]  These were ideas that were invented in this PsyOps cuterie.
[3:33:45.520 --> 3:33:49.520]  As we move on, it talks about the fact that what really has
[3:33:49.520 --> 3:33:52.520]  to be changed here is not just the human mind,
[3:33:52.520 --> 3:33:55.520]  but human action by changing the human brain.
[3:33:55.520 --> 3:33:58.520]  It says that we're going to have to use cognitive warfare
[3:33:58.520 --> 3:34:02.520]  and other techniques such as cognitive infiltration
[3:34:02.520 --> 3:34:06.520]  to sow dissonance, to instigate conflicts,
[3:34:06.520 --> 3:34:08.520]  polarize opinions, and radicalize.
[3:34:08.520 --> 3:34:12.520]  Now, if you remember, Cass Sunstein wrote a paper many
[3:34:12.520 --> 3:34:15.520]  years ago about cognitive infiltration.
[3:34:15.520 --> 3:34:16.520]  I actually read that whole paper.
[3:34:16.520 --> 3:34:19.520]  And oddly enough, it was a philosophy paper.
[3:34:19.520 --> 3:34:20.520]  That's kind of my field.
[3:34:20.520 --> 3:34:22.520]  So I didn't expect it to be what it was.
[3:34:22.520 --> 3:34:26.520]  And he basically just goes into how philosophy and the
[3:34:26.520 --> 3:34:30.520]  worldview warfare that philosophy can teach PsyOps is crucial
[3:34:30.520 --> 3:34:35.520]  to understanding how to disrupt all of the truth movements.
[3:34:35.520 --> 3:34:39.520]  And one of the things he said would be key was to infiltrate,
[3:34:39.520 --> 3:34:43.520]  polarize, and come up with fake conspiracy.
[3:34:43.520 --> 3:34:45.520]  And this is a technique that we've seen the system using
[3:34:45.520 --> 3:34:47.520]  for decades, disinformation.
[3:34:47.520 --> 3:34:50.520]  And now we even see the late night TV hosts, right?
[3:34:50.520 --> 3:34:54.520]  They even come on and say that disinformation is what all
[3:34:54.520 --> 3:34:57.520]  of the people who put out truth are, right?
[3:34:57.520 --> 3:35:00.520]  The comedy so-called hosts that are making fun of Alex
[3:35:00.520 --> 3:35:04.520]  talking about COVID and ivermectin and all that.
[3:35:04.520 --> 3:35:06.520]  That's all disinformation.
[3:35:06.520 --> 3:35:10.520]  So what they typically do is just gaslight and just lie
[3:35:10.520 --> 3:35:15.520]  and just continue to lie so much so that people are just
[3:35:15.520 --> 3:35:18.520]  disoriented and they can no longer tell truth from falsehood.
[3:35:18.520 --> 3:35:20.520]  The whole society then becomes based on lies.
[3:35:20.520 --> 3:35:25.520]  And that's actually a powerful technique of psychological warfare.
[3:35:25.520 --> 3:35:28.520]  So it goes on to say that by disrupting and infiltrating all
[3:35:28.520 --> 3:35:32.520]  of the groups that oppose NATOs, which is just a criminal
[3:35:32.520 --> 3:35:34.520]  organization basically.
[3:35:34.520 --> 3:35:39.520]  So basically anyone who disagrees with NATO is disinformation,
[3:35:39.520 --> 3:35:42.520]  right, which is ridiculous because you just, you have to
[3:35:42.520 --> 3:35:45.520]  wonder, do all the people who participate in this, you've got
[3:35:45.520 --> 3:35:47.520]  all these people on here, like these military people that
[3:35:47.520 --> 3:35:52.520]  are sitting around in this Zoom call participating in this
[3:35:52.520 --> 3:35:55.520]  discussion and panel, do they actually believe this?
[3:35:55.520 --> 3:36:01.520]  How do people think that what they're promoting is going
[3:36:01.520 --> 3:36:04.520]  to benefit them, right?
[3:36:04.520 --> 3:36:06.520]  I mean, these people, many of them, not all of them, but many
[3:36:06.520 --> 3:36:07.520]  of them have children, right?
[3:36:07.520 --> 3:36:11.520]  Now we know the upper crust of the initiates, the inner party
[3:36:11.520 --> 3:36:13.520]  at the top, they don't have children and they don't want
[3:36:13.520 --> 3:36:14.520]  children, right?
[3:36:14.520 --> 3:36:17.520]  But the people who are the engines and fosters of this system,
[3:36:17.520 --> 3:36:19.520]  many of them have children.
[3:36:19.520 --> 3:36:22.520]  And I just don't understand if, like, do they think that their
[3:36:22.520 --> 3:36:25.520]  children are actually going to be exempted from mandatory
[3:36:25.520 --> 3:36:26.520]  chipping?
[3:36:26.520 --> 3:36:29.520]  I mean, the UK transhumanist document says everybody's going
[3:36:29.520 --> 3:36:30.520]  to be chipped.
[3:36:30.520 --> 3:36:34.520]  Everyone will have their biology invaded to become synthetic
[3:36:34.520 --> 3:36:36.520]  silicon-based life forms.
[3:36:36.520 --> 3:36:37.520]  I'm not joking.
[3:36:37.520 --> 3:36:38.520]  That's what it says.
[3:36:38.520 --> 3:36:40.520]  Now, you could debate whether you think that's going to
[3:36:40.520 --> 3:36:42.520]  actually happen or how far they're going to get with that,
[3:36:42.520 --> 3:36:44.520]  but that's their plan.
[3:36:44.520 --> 3:36:47.520]  And it's a bond villain, maniacal, mad scientist level,
[3:36:47.520 --> 3:36:49.520]  crazy plan, right?
[3:36:49.520 --> 3:36:51.520]  It's pinky in the brain level shit, right?
[3:36:51.520 --> 3:36:53.520]  Oops, excuse me.
[3:36:53.520 --> 3:36:56.520]  So as we get through this document, it goes on to say that
[3:36:56.520 --> 3:37:01.520]  the cognitive warfare, this new domain, is it deals with ways
[3:37:01.520 --> 3:37:03.520]  to actually harm the brain itself.
[3:37:03.520 --> 3:37:08.520]  So it goes beyond just the notion of, again, influencing
[3:37:08.520 --> 3:37:10.520]  and changing your thought processes.
[3:37:10.520 --> 3:37:13.520]  It's the actual physical brain itself and the neurons that
[3:37:13.520 --> 3:37:15.520]  have to be altered and changed.
[3:37:15.520 --> 3:37:20.520]  It goes on to say that the in-house think tank of NATO's
[3:37:20.520 --> 3:37:25.520]  research here, one of the hottest topics, which is, by the way,
[3:37:25.520 --> 3:37:27.520]  situated in the US.
[3:37:27.520 --> 3:37:29.520]  So this is not a Canadian thing or Euro thing.
[3:37:29.520 --> 3:37:33.520]  This is actually all in-house, in, at US military bases.
[3:37:33.520 --> 3:37:37.520]  It says that this cognitive warfare must, first of all,
[3:37:37.520 --> 3:37:41.520]  focus on information war and changing the brain ultimately,
[3:37:41.520 --> 3:37:44.520]  not just through the information that comes in,
[3:37:44.520 --> 3:37:46.520]  but the alteration of the brain itself.
[3:37:46.520 --> 3:37:51.520]  It goes on to say that cognitive warfare involves the alteration
[3:37:51.520 --> 3:37:54.520]  of the brain through nanotechnology.
[3:37:54.520 --> 3:38:00.520]  So actually nanotech, it says, is going to be key to the art
[3:38:00.520 --> 3:38:04.520]  of using technology to alter the human targets themselves.
[3:38:04.520 --> 3:38:09.520]  And this includes nanotech, biotech, infotech, and all the
[3:38:09.520 --> 3:38:13.520]  machinations of cognitive science to alter the very brain itself
[3:38:13.520 --> 3:38:17.520]  so that the thought processes are altered so that humans
[3:38:17.520 --> 3:38:20.520]  don't probably do things like critical thinking.
[3:38:20.520 --> 3:38:23.520]  I mean, that's what presumably they're talking about here.
[3:38:23.520 --> 3:38:25.520]  They don't want people who are critically thinking.
[3:38:25.520 --> 3:38:29.520]  They want people who are just drones that basically emit the
[3:38:29.520 --> 3:38:31.520]  signal that the system puts out.
[3:38:31.520 --> 3:38:34.520]  And I was just reminded of that movie, the cell, right?
[3:38:34.520 --> 3:38:37.520]  If you've seen this, you'll know what I'm talking about.
[3:38:37.520 --> 3:38:39.520]  If you haven't seen it, I recommend going and watching it.
[3:38:39.520 --> 3:38:43.520]  It's a Stephen King story that they made into a movie in 2016.
[3:38:43.520 --> 3:38:46.520]  It's got Samuel L. Jackson and John Q. Zay.
[3:38:46.520 --> 3:38:48.520]  Look at the big brains on Brad, right?
[3:38:48.520 --> 3:38:54.520]  2016 cell, not the old 2002 or 2003 cell with J. Lo and Vince Vaughn.
[3:38:54.520 --> 3:38:59.520]  That's also a Stephen King story, but this one is about the fact
[3:38:59.520 --> 3:39:04.520]  that people are being mutated into becoming cell receptors
[3:39:04.520 --> 3:39:07.520]  and that the cell signals, kind of like Kingsman,
[3:39:07.520 --> 3:39:10.520]  if you saw the Kingsman, similar type of plot, right?
[3:39:10.520 --> 3:39:14.520]  In this one, it's this basically cellular signal that's
[3:39:14.520 --> 3:39:19.520]  emitted to influence people's brain patterns and brain signals.
[3:39:19.520 --> 3:39:20.520]  And people just start losing it, right?
[3:39:20.520 --> 3:39:22.520]  They start going crazy.
[3:39:22.520 --> 3:39:25.520]  And as you can imagine, it's a sort of dystopian walking dead,
[3:39:25.520 --> 3:39:27.520]  apocalypse type story.
[3:39:27.520 --> 3:39:32.520]  But it's relevant because that's kind of what's in all of these documents.
[3:39:32.520 --> 3:39:36.520]  It's what they're talking about with altering people through the signals.
[3:39:36.520 --> 3:39:40.520]  Again, interesting that Samuel L. Jackson was in Kingsman,
[3:39:40.520 --> 3:39:42.520]  which is basically the same plot, right?
[3:39:42.520 --> 3:39:46.520]  If you remember in Kingsman, he's the maniacal, malthusian villain
[3:39:46.520 --> 3:39:51.520]  who wants to use the SIM cards and the cell signals to disrupt
[3:39:51.520 --> 3:39:54.520]  and turn everybody into zombies and then basically depopulate.
[3:39:54.520 --> 3:39:56.520]  And he's got a breakaway civilization, right?
[3:39:56.520 --> 3:39:59.520]  And if you want to go deeper into that breakaway civilization,
[3:39:59.520 --> 3:40:02.520]  I just did a three hour talk on my YouTube channel where I got
[3:40:02.520 --> 3:40:04.520]  into the actual white papers and documents,
[3:40:04.520 --> 3:40:07.520]  report from Iron Mountain, Continutive Government,
[3:40:07.520 --> 3:40:10.520]  all of these rank corporation things that actually do discuss
[3:40:10.520 --> 3:40:13.520]  the possibility of a breakaway civilization of the elite,
[3:40:13.520 --> 3:40:17.520]  which we see in Moonraker, which we see in movies like Sky Captain
[3:40:17.520 --> 3:40:20.520]  and The World of Tomorrow, where a malthusian villain wants
[3:40:20.520 --> 3:40:26.520]  to depopulate and reseed the planet with his offspring.
[3:40:26.520 --> 3:40:32.520]  I mean, I remember because Alex would always talk about
[3:40:32.520 --> 3:40:37.520]  in the 80s and 90s, there was these old documents that would mention
[3:40:37.520 --> 3:40:41.520]  the possibility of the matrix and this kind of stuff.
[3:40:41.520 --> 3:40:42.520]  So I wouldn't found those documents.
[3:40:42.520 --> 3:40:44.520]  I put them in my first book.
[3:40:44.520 --> 3:40:47.520]  And I found another one, too, where back in the 90s,
[3:40:47.520 --> 3:40:51.520]  they were talking about the implementation of microchips.
[3:40:51.520 --> 3:40:55.520]  I think it's an Air Force document in the 90s that talks about
[3:40:55.520 --> 3:40:59.520]  how the future of warfare will involve what they were experimenting
[3:40:59.520 --> 3:41:03.520]  with at that time in the 90s of microchips relaying to satellites,
[3:41:03.520 --> 3:41:05.520]  relaying to ground-based computers.
[3:41:05.520 --> 3:41:09.520]  So basically, eye in the sky and then monitoring and tracking all of
[3:41:09.520 --> 3:41:13.520]  the troops in the warfare scenarios, which again,
[3:41:13.520 --> 3:41:16.520]  the warfare scenarios are the test bed for what they then roll out
[3:41:16.520 --> 3:41:19.520]  10, 20 years later on the domestic population.
[3:41:19.520 --> 3:41:21.520]  That's what's so crucial to understand is that things like
[3:41:21.520 --> 3:41:26.520]  Vietnam War, and again, I did a whole hour on here with you guys
[3:41:26.520 --> 3:41:31.520]  about how they roll out the warfare, the tech from Vietnam
[3:41:31.520 --> 3:41:35.520]  20, 30 years later, which was pioneering drone stuff, right?
[3:41:35.520 --> 3:41:41.520]  Vietnam was the first to use UAV unarmed to unmanned aerial
[3:41:41.520 --> 3:41:43.520]  vehicles and drones.
[3:41:43.520 --> 3:41:46.520]  That was first done in Vietnam. This is covered in Andy Jacobson's
[3:41:46.520 --> 3:41:49.520]  DARPA book, the whole history of DARPA, right?
[3:41:49.520 --> 3:41:52.520]  Everything that's in this document is really what DARPA has rolled
[3:41:52.520 --> 3:41:55.520]  out as the R&D arm of the deep state.
[3:41:55.520 --> 3:41:57.520]  I mean, the very Internet that we're using right now,
[3:41:57.520 --> 3:42:00.520]  that's DARPA, ARPA net.
[3:42:00.520 --> 3:42:01.520]  That's what that is, right?
[3:42:01.520 --> 3:42:07.520]  It was a wartime cryptography NSA Cold War era information relay
[3:42:07.520 --> 3:42:10.520]  that they rolled out on the public.
[3:42:10.520 --> 3:42:13.520]  I mean, the Internet has a lot of good things.
[3:42:13.520 --> 3:42:14.520]  I'm not saying it's bad.
[3:42:14.520 --> 3:42:15.520]  We're all on the Internet.
[3:42:15.520 --> 3:42:16.520]  We're all using it.
[3:42:16.520 --> 3:42:21.520]  But remember that it comes out of military psyopsis and wartime.
[3:42:21.520 --> 3:42:24.520]  And so it says, it notes in this document, it says,
[3:42:24.520 --> 3:42:26.520]  we're going to have to change the way people think to make sure
[3:42:26.520 --> 3:42:30.520]  that they don't, basically they don't think.
[3:42:30.520 --> 3:42:32.520]  It's not what we think, but change the way we think.
[3:42:32.520 --> 3:42:34.520]  This reminds me of the recent articles.
[3:42:34.520 --> 3:42:36.520]  Don't do your own research.
[3:42:36.520 --> 3:42:38.520]  Don't go and study on your own.
[3:42:38.520 --> 3:42:40.520]  Don't go down the rabbit hole the New York Times said.
[3:42:40.520 --> 3:42:42.520]  It's basically that going this, right?
[3:42:42.520 --> 3:42:43.520]  Don't go anywhere.
[3:42:43.520 --> 3:42:44.520]  We'll be right back.
[3:42:44.520 --> 3:42:47.520]  You're working on a Thursday night in mid-April 2021.
[3:42:47.520 --> 3:42:48.520]  And I just want to say something.
[3:42:48.520 --> 3:42:51.520]  I am so blessed and honored to work with this incredible crew
[3:42:51.520 --> 3:42:53.520]  that has come together over the years.
[3:42:53.520 --> 3:42:54.520]  It is truly an answer to prayer.
[3:42:54.520 --> 3:42:58.520]  And I am so blessed and thankful for all of you, the listeners of this show.
[3:42:58.520 --> 3:43:01.520]  I want you to know that I love you and I appreciate you.
[3:43:01.520 --> 3:43:04.520]  Whether you are old, whether you are Hispanic, white, black,
[3:43:04.520 --> 3:43:05.520]  it doesn't matter.
[3:43:05.520 --> 3:43:06.520]  You got red blood.
[3:43:06.520 --> 3:43:08.520]  You love freedom and justice.
[3:43:08.520 --> 3:43:12.520]  And if you love our innocent children, we are brothers and sisters together.
[3:43:12.520 --> 3:43:16.520]  And it has just been an incredible experience to work with you over the years.
[3:43:16.520 --> 3:43:20.520]  And as crazier things are, I want to keep working under the future.
[3:43:20.520 --> 3:43:23.520]  But again, that's really up to you and up to God.
[3:43:23.520 --> 3:43:28.520]  So please, I hope God works through you and puts a message in your heart to support us.
[3:43:28.520 --> 3:43:31.520]  But again, that's up to you and your relationship with God.
[3:43:31.520 --> 3:43:34.520]  I just want to thank you all for the years of support you've given us
[3:43:34.520 --> 3:43:39.520]  and what you've done and just ask you again to pray to God and ask what God's vision is for you.
[3:43:39.520 --> 3:43:42.520]  And hopefully God will touch your heart to continue to support InfoHorse.
[3:43:42.520 --> 3:43:43.520]  God bless.
[3:43:43.520 --> 3:43:47.520]  Back in stock, down and out, liquid sleep support.
[3:43:47.520 --> 3:43:48.520]  It's been out of stock for a while.
[3:43:48.520 --> 3:43:52.520]  It's one of three sleep aids we have at InfoHorseStore.com.
[3:43:52.520 --> 3:43:53.520]  This one has been very popular.
[3:43:53.520 --> 3:43:54.520]  It's sold off the shelves.
[3:43:54.520 --> 3:43:58.520]  It's back in stock, down and out, liquid sleep support.
[3:43:58.520 --> 3:44:04.520]  This is probably the strongest sleep aid that we have, I would say.
[3:44:04.520 --> 3:44:08.520]  Knockout, rocket rest, both great, comes in pill form.
[3:44:08.520 --> 3:44:12.520]  This is the liquid tincture and I think this is probably the most powerful one.
[3:44:12.520 --> 3:44:14.520]  Survival Shield X2, nascent iodine.
[3:44:14.520 --> 3:44:17.520]  This is, if you haven't done an iodine challenge yet,
[3:44:17.520 --> 3:44:21.520]  if you haven't done the iodine challenge, what are you waiting for now is the time.
[3:44:21.520 --> 3:44:24.520]  Super male and super female vitality.
[3:44:24.520 --> 3:44:28.520]  Living Defense Plus and the organic greens fiber caps.
[3:44:28.520 --> 3:44:32.520]  We have a limited supply of these right now, but we want to sell them all out
[3:44:32.520 --> 3:44:33.520]  so we can order a new batch.
[3:44:33.520 --> 3:44:34.520]  It was very popular.
[3:44:34.520 --> 3:44:36.520]  The organic greens fiber caps.
[3:44:36.520 --> 3:44:40.520]  But we have all kinds of other great supplements that are great for so many different things.
[3:44:40.520 --> 3:44:43.520]  Take advantage of those.
[3:44:46.520 --> 3:44:49.520]  What are champions made of?
[3:44:49.520 --> 3:44:55.520]  Here's a man who can show you.

[3:47:28.900 --> 3:47:33.620]  we definitely want and this is a crucial time for info wars to be here for alex
[3:47:33.620 --> 3:47:37.940]  to be here because it's at that tipping point where we really could continue to
[3:47:37.940 --> 3:47:43.100]  just explode and have mega mega mega mass awakening we're already starting to
[3:47:43.100 --> 3:47:47.100]  see a mass awakening so go to the info or store get those products I see a lot
[3:47:47.100 --> 3:47:52.420]  of a lot of soy out there in terms of the the male region a lot of soy boys
[3:47:52.420 --> 3:47:59.020]  that have lost mojo you know you got to have mojo to get you know a mate and to
[3:47:59.020 --> 3:48:04.940]  have offspring and a big part of the globally plan is no offspring no offspring
[3:48:04.940 --> 3:48:10.300]  for you no no you have to be sterile you have to go live in a coom pod basically
[3:48:10.300 --> 3:48:15.060]  where you just watch VR porn all day right no we don't want to do that we
[3:48:15.060 --> 3:48:20.100]  want to be actual men we want to have you know edgy masculinity we don't want to
[3:48:20.100 --> 3:48:24.220]  be soy males so a lot of the products in the info or store can help you with
[3:48:24.220 --> 3:48:28.540]  that and I want to encourage you to go there yes we don't want to be that dude
[3:48:28.540 --> 3:48:34.900]  there's too many of that dude out there now I was getting into the movies and
[3:48:34.900 --> 3:48:39.620]  themes of the railway civilization the Malthusian plan of moon raker and
[3:48:39.620 --> 3:48:42.940]  skycap in the world of tomorrow and you know all these various there's so many
[3:48:42.940 --> 3:48:47.900]  movies that have this plot right so many novels so many stories so many TV shows
[3:48:47.900 --> 3:48:50.740]  that you can't really list them I actually did list them by the way if you
[3:48:50.740 --> 3:48:55.140]  go to my YouTube channel you can watch that recent video talk that I did
[3:48:55.140 --> 3:49:00.460]  yesterday a couple days ago on the breakaway civilization the Psyop plan and
[3:49:00.460 --> 3:49:04.900]  how they want to have this project Noah but basically to the elite will go off
[3:49:04.900 --> 3:49:08.660]  somewhere else and you think oh that's crazy that's just fiction really did you
[3:49:08.660 --> 3:49:14.140]  see what MIT Bill Gates and Jeffrey Epstein had planned where that was
[3:49:14.140 --> 3:49:19.580]  actually the plan was to experiment with reseeding and having basically their
[3:49:19.580 --> 3:49:22.980]  own harem of a future race I'm not joking that sounds crazy that was in the
[3:49:22.980 --> 3:49:27.640]  New York Times so that was a an Epstein plan was to try to do something Hugo
[3:49:27.640 --> 3:49:32.740]  Drax level like that and as you know last week we covered no time to die in
[3:49:32.740 --> 3:49:36.340]  death where I went into the history of the in Fleming I went into all of his
[3:49:36.340 --> 3:49:40.620]  Psyops and wartime operations and wouldn't you know what what was in
[3:49:40.620 --> 3:49:48.340]  Fleming a high level oh Psyops exactly exactly what we're looking at today and
[3:49:48.340 --> 3:49:53.140]  if we just have basic it's not like we have to get a PhD in Psyops to decode
[3:49:53.140 --> 3:49:56.380]  this stuff I mean if we just have basic critical thinking if we know basic
[3:49:56.380 --> 3:50:00.580]  logical fallacies we're not gonna fall into being duped by this nonsense right
[3:50:00.580 --> 3:50:06.220]  we're not gonna fall into the idea of going and getting a stabby to get a
[3:50:06.220 --> 3:50:09.460]  free donut right and that's the that's what we're talking to this is the kind
[3:50:09.460 --> 3:50:12.940]  of BS they come up with is these lame sales pitches well maybe if we give
[3:50:12.940 --> 3:50:17.420]  everybody donuts they'll go get booster shots and it worked amazing I can I can
[3:50:17.420 --> 3:50:23.340]  imagine being that stupid as to go get an experimental vaccine it's not a
[3:50:23.340 --> 3:50:26.860]  vaccine gene therapy for a freaking donut and those donuts aren't even any
[3:50:26.860 --> 3:50:33.380]  good so it goes on to say that what I think the document is talking about with
[3:50:33.380 --> 3:50:40.220]  the alteration of the brain is actually the chemicals the bio warfare etc that
[3:50:40.220 --> 3:50:45.580]  will alter the brain processes right I mean everybody knows that chemicals can
[3:50:45.580 --> 3:50:49.900]  basically damage your brain right you can become a slow boy basically if
[3:50:49.900 --> 3:50:53.460]  you're exposed to mercury or any of these other toxic chemicals right I'm
[3:50:53.460 --> 3:50:56.980]  actually working a paint store so I'm probably a slow boy from the chemicals
[3:50:56.980 --> 3:51:00.900]  that I was around I don't even know but this says that we're gonna have to change
[3:51:00.900 --> 3:51:03.780]  the brain and I think this is probably talking about shutting off critical
[3:51:03.780 --> 3:51:08.540]  thinking faculty right now there was that video that's gone around for years
[3:51:08.540 --> 3:51:14.460]  it's 15 years old where it appears to be a Pentagon debriefing talk about
[3:51:14.460 --> 3:51:19.500]  stabbies right that can shut off various areas of the brain particularly
[3:51:19.500 --> 3:51:25.220]  relating to higher cognitive faculties and theology and religious experiences
[3:51:25.220 --> 3:51:29.940]  right now again I can't prove that that video is real if you go and look even
[3:51:29.940 --> 3:51:33.820]  the fact checkers like the the Snopes and the Reuters that they don't know if
[3:51:33.820 --> 3:51:38.260]  it's real or not nobody actually knows now it was redone as this fake thing with
[3:51:38.260 --> 3:51:41.260]  as claiming it was Bill Gates which obviously it's not Bill Gates up there
[3:51:41.260 --> 3:51:45.380]  don't know who it is but to me it looks like a real thing a real discussion and
[3:51:45.380 --> 3:51:49.220]  whether I know that video is real or not it doesn't matter because I know that
[3:51:49.220 --> 3:51:51.860]  DARPA and I know that all these white papers discuss that that's what they're
[3:51:51.860 --> 3:51:55.900]  after right I can give you the actual white papers that talk about those
[3:51:55.900 --> 3:52:00.780]  kinds of things targeting specific areas of the brain with this nanotech with
[3:52:00.780 --> 3:52:06.060]  these injections or whatever with these poisons basically and so I don't have to
[3:52:06.060 --> 3:52:10.220]  know if that video is real or not the document goes on to say that we have the
[3:52:10.220 --> 3:52:13.900]  potential by developing new weapons of harming the brain the potential to
[3:52:13.900 --> 3:52:17.820]  engage neuroscience and technology in many different approaches to human
[3:52:17.820 --> 3:52:23.020]  ecology to influence human ecology right and then we can very easily turn a
[3:52:23.020 --> 3:52:26.700]  civilian technology into a military one so in other words when Silicon Valley
[3:52:26.700 --> 3:52:30.580]  invents the latest technology of this or that they can just weaponize it and
[3:52:30.580 --> 3:52:35.100]  turn it into something that can't that is capable of destroying their enemies
[3:52:35.100 --> 3:52:37.820]  and targeting their enemies which is just the domestic population and it
[3:52:37.820 --> 3:52:41.500]  literally goes on to say well who's the enemy here it says potentially anyone
[3:52:41.500 --> 3:52:46.500]  potentially anyone using the internet I'm not joking anyone using the internet
[3:52:46.500 --> 3:52:51.340]  and cell phones is potentially the enemy because they can come in contact with
[3:52:51.340 --> 3:52:56.780]  this information aka truth and then they're an enemy combatant I'm not
[3:52:56.780 --> 3:53:00.540]  joking that's what this document says and it says well what's our goal total
[3:53:00.540 --> 3:53:05.460]  control total control can be achieved through cognitive warfare which has
[3:53:05.460 --> 3:53:10.100]  reached which has universal reach from starting with the individual to states
[3:53:10.100 --> 3:53:13.900]  and multinational organizations it is a field of action that is global and its
[3:53:13.900 --> 3:53:19.580]  aim is to seize control of the human being civilian as well as military
[3:53:19.580 --> 3:53:25.500]  mastering the human domain full spectrum dominance total control so you ask well
[3:53:25.500 --> 3:53:30.140]  well what's this what's the world orders plan why would they why would they
[3:53:30.140 --> 3:53:33.420]  put it in papers why would they put it up there because that's a form of
[3:53:33.420 --> 3:53:38.660]  psyops to tell you call gaslighting don't watch the movie gaslight the movie by
[3:53:38.660 --> 3:53:44.140]  George Cook or that's a movie that shows you the process of what happens on a
[3:53:44.140 --> 3:53:50.820]  micro scale when a psycho dude gas lights his new bride right and he drives her
[3:53:50.820 --> 3:53:55.900]  nuts basically intentionally why well in the movie it's spoiler alert to get her
[3:53:55.900 --> 3:54:03.140]  money she's an heiress but for the global elite it's to do the psyops on all of us
[3:54:03.140 --> 3:54:08.500]  to basically gaslight us to put it in put us into a desabilize catatonic fear
[3:54:08.500 --> 3:54:13.180]  based state that's it just to make us all in a perpetual anxious fear-based
[3:54:13.180 --> 3:54:18.900]  anxiety-ridden crazy population that then turns to the system oh please save me
[3:54:18.900 --> 3:54:22.740]  please I'll do whatever you say right and then it never it never lifts it
[3:54:22.740 --> 3:54:27.260]  never goes away right they just it's like a carrot on a stick like in a
[3:54:27.260 --> 3:54:30.820]  cartoon where you just keep going after the care and you never reach the carrot
[3:54:30.820 --> 3:54:34.220]  because it's just dangling in front of you further and further the more you go
[3:54:34.220 --> 3:54:38.380]  right that's exactly what this is and they know that that's the funny thing is
[3:54:38.380 --> 3:54:41.700]  that they actually talk about that in this document the document goes on to
[3:54:41.700 --> 3:54:47.460]  say that the world here is no longer targeting a battlefield opponent the
[3:54:47.460 --> 3:54:52.140]  future of the battlefield is the internet and the mind the inner world of the
[3:54:52.140 --> 3:54:56.420]  mind that's the future battlefield and so we have to control information control
[3:54:56.420 --> 3:55:01.700]  info or control the net because that's the future of all of this and
[3:55:01.700 --> 3:55:06.820]  presumably also the virtual world right when people start linking into sky net
[3:55:06.820 --> 3:55:10.580]  getting into the matrix when they roll the matrix out then it will be total
[3:55:10.580 --> 3:55:15.060]  control right because then they're in your body the matrix what cloud said we
[3:55:15.060 --> 3:55:19.460]  will get in your body the nanotech stabbies are them getting in your body
[3:55:19.460 --> 3:55:24.620]  and so the document goes on to say the NATO sponsor study says some NATO
[3:55:24.620 --> 3:55:27.620]  nations have already acknowledged that neuroscientific techniques and
[3:55:27.620 --> 3:55:32.020]  technologies have the high potential for operational use in security defense and
[3:55:32.020 --> 3:55:37.460]  intelligence the breakthroughs in these neuroscientific methods are the usage of
[3:55:37.460 --> 3:55:41.140]  research findings and products to directly facilitate performance of
[3:55:41.140 --> 3:55:45.740]  combatants the integration of the human machine interfaces to optimize combat
[3:55:45.740 --> 3:55:51.700]  and the usage of the new development of autonomous drones biological and chemical
[3:55:51.700 --> 3:55:56.500]  warfare neuro weapons nanotech and it says this is exactly what DARPA has been
[3:55:56.500 --> 3:55:59.340]  working on at the Pentagon for the last several decades and it goes on to say
[3:55:59.340 --> 3:56:09.260]  DARPA is key here DARPA is the arm of this to develop it says the research can
[3:56:09.260 --> 3:56:13.980]  be utilized to mitigate aggression foster cognitions and emotions or of
[3:56:13.980 --> 3:56:19.340]  passivity remember Brzezinski's book that they could use ELF VLF to to agitate an
[3:56:19.340 --> 3:56:22.420]  entire continent through the signals that they put out that's in Brzezinski's
[3:56:22.420 --> 3:56:28.500]  book between two ages or they could put out signals that calm everyone so in the
[3:56:28.500 --> 3:56:34.580]  Kingsman with Samuel L. Jackson it's literally what's in Brzezinski's book
[3:56:34.580 --> 3:56:41.140]  between two ages that very thing it says that it can induce morbidity
[3:56:41.140 --> 3:56:45.420]  disability or suffering and neutralize all potential opponents to incur
[3:56:45.420 --> 3:56:49.460]  mortality in other words to maim and kill people that's what they're saying
[3:56:49.460 --> 3:56:55.980]  that we can use the nanotech the the emerging neuroscientific tech to maim
[3:56:55.980 --> 3:57:01.780]  induce foster aggression this is Kingsman level stuff and then it goes on to
[3:57:01.780 --> 3:57:07.340]  say that the real battle here isn't again the warfare of the field the real
[3:57:07.340 --> 3:57:16.820]  warfare is the psycho-cultural domain culture war in other words movies music
[3:57:16.820 --> 3:57:23.580]  media right using those things to change people's thought processes combined
[3:57:23.580 --> 3:57:30.780]  with the chemicals in the food the water the stabbies to change brains you want
[3:57:30.780 --> 3:57:37.100]  more on that go to my shop at my website the COVID-19 face diaper is a
[3:57:37.100 --> 3:57:44.340]  symbol of subservience a symbol of slavery a symbol of the chains that the
[3:57:44.340 --> 3:57:48.540]  medical tyranny combine controlled by the global private corporations has put
[3:57:48.540 --> 3:57:54.340]  in place it is the symbol of the permanent emergency from which we will
[3:57:54.340 --> 3:57:58.980]  never emerge it is the symbol that we are diseased at evil and bad must cover
[3:57:58.980 --> 3:58:06.020]  our disease criminal faces from the light of the sun it is the symbol of our
[3:58:06.020 --> 3:58:13.340]  complete and total absolute surrender to evil ladies and gentlemen we are
[3:58:13.340 --> 3:58:18.700]  crossing the Rubicon now the entire future destiny of humanity is upon us
[3:58:18.700 --> 3:58:22.260]  claus Schwab and the unit myth they're coming out with implantable microchips
[3:58:22.260 --> 3:58:27.100]  as part of the world ID and carbon taxes things only get worse from here if we
[3:58:27.100 --> 3:58:32.700]  submit they only get better if we resist and say no non-compliance non-compliance
[3:58:32.700 --> 3:58:38.580]  non-compliance one of the most studied and researched areas of human health
[3:58:38.580 --> 3:58:43.260]  and physiology is inflammation it's associated with cancer it's associated
[3:58:43.260 --> 3:58:47.420]  with joint problems associated with viral infections bacterial infections it's
[3:58:47.420 --> 3:58:51.580]  associated with death and out of all the incredible compounds that God gave us
[3:58:51.580 --> 3:58:54.940]  through nature that fights inflammation and makes our lives better
[3:58:54.940 --> 3:58:59.980]  turmeric is chief amongst them all and chief amongst all the turmeric products
[3:58:59.980 --> 3:59:04.380]  out there his body's ultimate turmeric formula my wife loves turmeric she has
[3:59:04.380 --> 3:59:07.700]  joint pain but just take a lot of it the type of stuff she buys the groceries
[3:59:07.700 --> 3:59:11.260]  tour for to work she started taking this instead all we need to take one pill
[3:59:11.260 --> 3:59:16.380]  instead of four why is it so good it's not just turmeric it's concentrated with
[3:59:16.380 --> 3:59:20.460]  a proprietary process it's back in stock if you're being sold out almost five
