[00:00.000 --> 00:14.400]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:14.400 --> 00:23.160]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:23.160 --> 00:38.000]  the Nazi Blitzkrieg above France and then of course England killed hundreds
[00:38.000 --> 00:43.520]  of thousands of people raining bombs down on major cities particularly the
[00:43.520 --> 00:50.600]  Blitz and you did not see one one thousandth of the panic that we saw in
[00:50.600 --> 00:56.760]  the West yesterday and today when a reported Islamists convert with
[00:56.760 --> 01:01.000]  connections at least as a fellow traveler and admirer of ISIS that means
[01:01.000 --> 01:09.600]  Al Qaeda's new comic book name attacked the parliament shooting one of the honor
[01:09.600 --> 01:15.160]  guard ceremonial honor guard that was there at the War Memorial and then
[01:15.160 --> 01:19.880]  himself being shot by the sergeant in arms of course it was someone with a gun
[01:19.880 --> 01:24.040]  that was able to stop the bad guy with a gun good guys with guns stopping bad
[01:24.040 --> 01:30.640]  guys with guns 2 plus 2 equals 4 but to see the panic for hours after the
[01:30.640 --> 01:36.920]  parliament piling chairs up on doors and just men with their submachine gun
[01:36.920 --> 01:43.240]  shaking in fear like they had just battled the Tyrannosaurus Rex shows the
[01:43.240 --> 01:48.000]  mind control and the fear that they've instilled not just in the general
[01:48.000 --> 01:54.560]  public but government itself this does not radiate confidence worldwide for
[01:54.560 --> 02:02.840]  the West I will assure you it's over the top and again it's very sad for the
[02:02.840 --> 02:09.480]  gentleman that was shot and killed but we had to hear how there was a second
[02:09.480 --> 02:18.760]  gunman for hours as they locked down much of the city of Ottawa it's just a
[02:18.760 --> 02:25.640]  another signpost on the road to insanity Corporal Nathan Cirillo of
[02:25.640 --> 02:31.880]  Hamilton identified a soldier gunned down in Ottawa attack this coward
[02:31.880 --> 02:36.360]  reportedly just walked right up to him and shot him multiple times in the chest
[02:36.360 --> 02:42.440]  and then went and mindlessly sprayed some bullets into the parliament and then
[02:42.440 --> 02:47.120]  was shot and killed before he could kill more people and it's because of these
[02:47.120 --> 02:51.360]  radical Islamists being funded by the West that I have predicted will start
[02:51.360 --> 02:56.040]  mass shootings not hard to predict that like predicting tornadoes will come
[02:56.040 --> 03:03.880]  sometimes in the spring or that you'll get hurricanes in the fall in the
[03:03.880 --> 03:10.400]  Atlantic Ocean or you'll get typhoons in the Pacific you go out and you fund
[03:10.400 --> 03:14.400]  and you rock star these groups and you give them all this attention you let
[03:14.400 --> 03:20.040]  them operate on Twitter and Facebook all info wars is censored you're going to
[03:20.040 --> 03:23.760]  have this go on and they don't care people cross the border and come and do
[03:23.760 --> 03:28.600]  this I have predicted they're gonna shoot down airplanes in Europe Canada or
[03:28.600 --> 03:33.520]  the US or all three we've talked about the 15,000 missing heat-seeking missiles
[03:33.520 --> 03:37.320]  that our government basically gave to al Qaeda they changed the name to ISIS it's
[03:37.320 --> 03:44.040]  a big deal now I'm gonna cover that but I'm just gonna stop right here and I'm
[03:44.040 --> 03:50.240]  gonna tell everybody something that we're working on right now that is so
[03:50.240 --> 04:00.960]  big that I don't even feel worthy as a news organization myself individually I
[04:00.960 --> 04:05.320]  don't feel like it's just bizarre like why me why do we always get the
[04:05.320 --> 04:10.840]  information why are we given such dangerous information why don't other
[04:10.840 --> 04:22.320]  people get what's going on and when I say I don't feel up to it I don't know
[04:22.320 --> 04:32.760]  how to announce the information I have on here I'm gonna try to think about it
[04:32.760 --> 04:37.560]  during the break and I have a tendency when I when I've got things this
[04:37.560 --> 04:44.640]  horrible but this important to report to not cover it you notice I just went
[04:44.640 --> 04:47.640]  into the shooting of an Ottawa because psychologically even though it's a
[04:47.640 --> 04:54.200]  tragedy it's more comforting to me this is something I know it's terrible it's
[04:54.200 --> 04:56.680]  it's the opposite of comforting but compared to the news I have it is
[04:56.680 --> 05:02.560]  comforting we're gonna try to cover it we come back after consulting top doctors

[08:18.160 --> 08:31.720]  we're here monday through friday 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. central and we just go with
[08:31.720 --> 08:39.600]  the truth takes us coming up at the bottom of the shower we're going to
[08:39.600 --> 08:44.320]  have a medical doctor on who wants to use his name and who he's given us his
[08:44.320 --> 08:54.040]  credentials who says that there are cases of Ebola in major hospitals and
[08:54.040 --> 09:00.160]  that they're told to basically cover it up and say that it was malaria out of
[09:00.160 --> 09:09.760]  Africa and that the feds come and swoop the bodies or the patients away now
[09:09.760 --> 09:17.080]  remember the head of the border patrol union said two months ago and last week
[09:17.080 --> 09:20.560]  on this show we're gonna get him back on by the way if we can today or tomorrow
[09:20.560 --> 09:26.120]  that indeed the CDC is on the border and is picking up people that have Ebola
[09:26.120 --> 09:35.000]  like symptoms now the reason this is of such concern is that for a week we've
[09:35.000 --> 09:45.280]  been in contact with a doctor who is the head of a major texas hospital this is
[09:45.280 --> 09:49.760]  a doctor I've known personally for about a year a doctor I've had dinner with
[09:49.760 --> 09:57.560]  multiple times a doctor I've gone out with friends to the broken spoke it's
[09:57.560 --> 10:02.960]  not a medical doctor that runs a hospital in Austin it's another major Texas
[10:02.960 --> 10:08.560]  city and he doesn't even want the city named but you can probably guess he told
[10:08.560 --> 10:15.000]  us a week ago confirmed exactly what this other doctor who's coming on record
[10:15.000 --> 10:20.520]  is going to tell you now since we began to learn about this we began reaching
[10:20.520 --> 10:24.080]  out to other medical doctors at hospitals and they get very upset and say
[10:24.080 --> 10:30.240]  I'm not supposed to talk to you about this but yes this is going on ladies and
[10:30.240 --> 10:35.760]  gentlemen Ebola is probably spreading inside the United States right now my
[10:35.760 --> 10:39.920]  gut level look at this why are they saying the family doesn't have it why
[10:39.920 --> 10:43.360]  did none of the neighbors get it none of the kids around his kids but two nurses
[10:43.360 --> 10:48.440]  the nurses have unions the nurses are going to speak up for themselves the
[10:48.440 --> 10:53.680]  nurses have already been protesting the cleanup crews on the airplanes three
[10:53.680 --> 10:57.760]  weeks ago in New York and other areas began going on strike saying I'm not
[10:57.760 --> 11:02.240]  going to clean up vomit on these African flights they're coming in out of
[11:02.240 --> 11:05.320]  countries with Ebola we know they're covering up the numbers of Ebola deaths
[11:05.320 --> 11:10.320]  in Africa that's even in Associated Press they're set to have over a million
[11:10.320 --> 11:15.840]  people get Ebola the only place they can run is to the US everybody else shut
[11:15.840 --> 11:23.520]  the flights down months ago it's a no-brainer that they're covering up
[11:23.520 --> 11:29.640]  Ebola now it's a no-brainer and I've said in my gut I believe that's going on
[11:29.640 --> 11:34.280]  because my intellectual research shows that they're covering it up all the
[11:34.280 --> 11:40.080]  evidence points there they're trying to spread it but also my gut and everybody
[11:40.080 --> 11:51.640]  else's gut that I talked to is on fire right now and then I talked to a major
[11:51.640 --> 11:56.680]  doctor who quite frankly runs more than one hospital I'm just gonna leave it at
[11:56.680 --> 12:06.680]  that I mean a major medical center medical doctor director and he says I
[12:06.680 --> 12:09.640]  will lose my license they will come after me we've been told do not talk about
[12:09.640 --> 12:17.000]  it but yes it's true and don't you say who I am so we sit on this for a week
[12:17.000 --> 12:20.080]  Anthony good she already comes on yesterday and I don't know what my
[12:20.080 --> 12:23.920]  problem is that's why I say why me I don't even feel like I'm up to be able
[12:23.920 --> 12:28.640]  to cover things this big quite frankly and he mentions we know medical doctors
[12:28.640 --> 12:32.080]  that say it's spreading so a medical doctor calls in we get his number get
[12:32.080 --> 12:37.840]  his info call check on the hospital site it's him and he says yeah they're
[12:37.840 --> 12:41.800]  threatening people he's coming on in 15 minutes because I don't care this is too
[12:41.800 --> 12:50.040]  important Hippocratic oath do no harm this is sensational this is a stuff
[12:50.040 --> 12:59.240]  talk radios made of and I hate it I absolutely hate breaking this to you
[12:59.240 --> 13:05.720]  this government is so evil I mean I have three children I have a family I love
[13:05.720 --> 13:11.680]  and to know that this is probably confirming what we can already see the
[13:11.680 --> 13:17.320]  evidence of 95% chance Ebola spreading and they're they're
[13:17.320 --> 13:26.720]  covering it up I just can't believe it what an evil government because here's
[13:26.720 --> 13:29.400]  the deal they're not just covering it up to stop panic they're covering up
[13:29.400 --> 13:32.960]  things that would have stopped it spreading they want this on purpose and
[13:32.960 --> 13:38.280]  I'm just coming myself face-to-face with the fact that I've been right we are in
[13:38.280 --> 13:41.720]  this much trouble this just validates everything and I'm not happy to be
[13:41.720 --> 13:49.160]  validated to be vindicated because every instinct I've got is you've done your
[13:49.160 --> 13:54.120]  job you fought hard enough buddy you've spent 20 years battling this you are a
[13:54.120 --> 14:05.920]  major target get out of here or shut up and shut it down because most other
[14:05.920 --> 14:08.560]  people are cowards there aren't a lot of other outlets that will cover things
[14:08.560 --> 14:14.240]  like this and so you better believe I'm a major target but I'm not gonna shut it
[14:14.240 --> 14:19.120]  down and I'm not gonna shut up because sure I could run from this for a while
[14:19.120 --> 14:24.760]  we all collectively got in this position by running from tyranny and by trying to
[14:24.760 --> 14:28.880]  appease it and by not going up against it and it's like being beat up once a
[14:28.880 --> 14:33.000]  week by a bully at school you finally decide to fight back and even if you
[14:33.000 --> 14:38.480]  lose the fight they'll move on to somebody weaker because you fought back
[14:38.480 --> 14:42.880]  and bloody their nose as well and politically not physically it's time to
[14:42.880 --> 14:47.320]  start bloodying the establishment's nose and that's what it's gonna do when
[14:47.320 --> 14:56.680]  doctors and nurses don't shut up and go public with what the head of the retired
[14:56.680 --> 15:01.280]  more patrol union has said what more patrol active duty officers have told
[15:01.280 --> 15:08.560]  us point blank here in Austin and in Las Vegas at a medical conference Dr. Group
[15:08.560 --> 15:16.120]  was attending that yes they're whisking people away and disappearing them now if
[15:16.120 --> 15:21.040]  they were doing that to stop panic it would still be illegal and dangerous but
[15:21.040 --> 15:25.120]  you could argue don't want to create a panic not when they're letting the
[15:25.120 --> 15:28.800]  flight still in and clearly letting it spread so see they want the tyranny to
[15:28.800 --> 15:32.560]  whisk away whoever they want and create that precedent with secret medical
[15:32.560 --> 15:36.280]  armies backed up by paramilitary they want to introduce the idea of this
[15:36.280 --> 15:41.880]  going on while letting the crisis intensify former top board patrol agent
[15:41.880 --> 15:49.120]  CDC disappearing potential Ebola victims that's from October 10th 2014 13 days
[15:49.120 --> 15:55.920]  ago and I'll continue reading from the article former board of patrol agent
[15:55.920 --> 16:01.040]  Zach Taylor has divulged that CDC is working with border patrol authorities
[16:01.040 --> 16:05.160]  and the Department of Homeland Security to disappear potential Ebola victims
[16:05.160 --> 16:10.400]  attempting to cross the border in the United States I want Don Salazar and
[16:10.400 --> 16:17.640]  Kurt Nemo and Kit Daniels and Paul Watson and Steve Watson and Mikhail
[16:17.640 --> 16:22.200]  Phelan to all write about this from your own angle with Zach Taylor and these
[16:22.200 --> 16:27.480]  medical doctors whatever angle you want to go with but showing the history of
[16:27.480 --> 16:32.480]  them aiding and abetting the Ebola virus to try to raise the alarm and Watson's
[16:32.480 --> 16:35.480]  usually listening but he's over in England he went back to London he visited
[16:35.480 --> 16:38.360]  with us for three weeks he's thinking about coming here part-time in the
[16:38.360 --> 16:45.240]  years you know work over here with us Paul Watson had him call Steve and I've
[16:45.240 --> 16:49.280]  just they need to tune into what you're about to hear
[16:52.120 --> 16:55.120]  oh man
[16:56.560 --> 17:00.560]  see when I'm up here talking about
[17:00.560 --> 17:08.320]  genderless gingerbread figurines and the mayor wanting to arrest because that's
[17:08.320 --> 17:13.960]  what the subpoenas were for criminal investigation of preachers that speak
[17:13.960 --> 17:18.400]  out against homosexuality what are we doing with with stores saying we're
[17:18.400 --> 17:22.200]  only gonna have ginger genderless gingerbread people to not offend folks
[17:22.200 --> 17:26.480]  and they want to arrest preachers for reading out of the Bible and you got all
[17:26.480 --> 17:35.200]  these mystery illnesses flooding across the border and you've got people still
[17:35.200 --> 17:44.240]  rioting in st. Louis and in Ferguson and Africa is clearly been hit by some type
[17:44.240 --> 17:48.720]  of bio weapons souped up Ebola we had Francis Boyle that wrote the US
[17:48.720 --> 17:53.560]  biological weapons treaty that got adopted worldwide biological weapons
[17:53.560 --> 18:02.200]  expert dr. Francis Boyle is also a lawyer and he says it's a government
[18:02.200 --> 18:08.320]  operation Wayne Madsen formerly the NSA says the government operation names names
[18:08.320 --> 18:13.640]  the African scientists are saying that we have BBC pieces video pieces from the
[18:13.640 --> 18:16.800]  90s admitting the South African government created weaponized
[18:16.800 --> 18:22.800]  airborne Ebola and stuff sterilized blacks I mean I wish all this Intel
[18:22.800 --> 18:29.920]  wasn't just rolling in you think we like breaking one week after Benghazi that it
[18:29.920 --> 18:33.000]  was a hit of the ambassador because he didn't want to transfer stinger missiles
[18:33.000 --> 18:37.440]  al-Qaeda and that we predicted they would then say prepare for the stinger
[18:37.440 --> 18:40.920]  attacks in the West which they're now doing but never pointing out that our
[18:40.920 --> 18:47.240]  government armed them do you think it's fun I just want you to know for people
[18:47.240 --> 18:50.280]  that are new listeners ago this is off the chart crazy this stuff's too intense
[18:50.280 --> 18:56.000]  I'm sorry that's what's really going on you I don't want this to be this way

[24:34.040 --> 24:41.880]  office myself included have talked to multiple doctors medical doctors one of
[24:41.880 --> 24:49.680]  them that heads up a major hospital operation multiple hospitals that
[24:49.680 --> 24:58.240]  indeed Ebola what they believe is Ebola is showing up we are getting whistleblower
[24:58.240 --> 25:06.280]  contacts now pouring in from customs and border enforcement and other agencies
[25:06.280 --> 25:10.840]  confirming what we've gotten from our other ice sources and our medical
[25:10.840 --> 25:17.240]  doctor sources that there are people that have Ebola-like symptoms coming off of
[25:17.240 --> 25:21.960]  West African flights all over the United States and they're being ordered to
[25:21.960 --> 25:31.160]  release them when they screen positive for Ebola with the first test and by
[25:31.160 --> 25:35.080]  that the first test just shows it's probable that you have it and then you
[25:35.080 --> 25:39.760]  need to go for further screening and an official test and they just or ordered
[25:39.760 --> 25:46.520]  to release them this is the type of Intel with people saying I work for ice
[25:46.520 --> 25:53.480]  here's my number call me at lunch and then we call these people medical
[25:53.480 --> 25:56.480]  doctors and others and they give us their info and who they are and we call
[25:56.480 --> 26:00.920]  them on the hospital phone and get them on at the hospital separate from people
[26:00.920 --> 26:12.720]  we know so obviously what we're going to do here today is open the phones up
[26:12.720 --> 26:17.720]  after this doctor that's coming on a few minutes the next segment leaves us so
[26:17.720 --> 26:28.480]  that more medical doctors nurses nurse practitioners border patrol customs
[26:28.480 --> 26:37.760]  enforcement TSA you name it police officers so you could call in and if
[26:37.760 --> 26:42.520]  you want to go on record you can we'll call you vet who you are we have folks
[26:42.520 --> 26:48.040]  send us a copy of their driver's license we call you at work that's what we do
[26:48.040 --> 26:55.160]  we don't just get a call from a guy saying he's a medical doctor and then
[26:55.160 --> 27:02.720]  just believe it we go and find them on the hospital website we call them up at
[27:02.720 --> 27:19.600]  work we talk to them at work what we do it's not just that they're letting me a
[27:19.600 --> 27:24.040]  bowl of spread is that they're covering it up and I guess they think they can
[27:24.040 --> 27:28.160]  contain it or maybe they want to be out of control I don't know I just know it's
[27:28.160 --> 27:33.280]  criminal it's out of control and what does it say about the people running this
[27:33.280 --> 27:38.640]  country the British for two months plus have sealed their borders and don't
[27:38.640 --> 27:42.640]  let flights in from West Africa and screen people who jump from other
[27:42.640 --> 27:46.840]  countries they have a global database of where you came from
[27:48.040 --> 27:53.120]  Interpol databases other databases credit card records that's all runs of
[27:53.120 --> 27:58.400]  the computers to begin with worldwide unless you live in the middle of nowhere
[27:58.400 --> 28:02.000]  and you're going to pay in some small airline you know in some 10-seater or
[28:02.000 --> 28:07.240]  six-seater to fly you over the mountain in Alaska unless you're flying on planes
[28:07.240 --> 28:10.920]  that way or you're hitching a ride with somebody who's a private pilot you're in
[28:10.920 --> 28:16.120]  the system there aren't a lot of private pilots flying in out of West Africa into
[28:16.120 --> 28:23.760]  North America I'll assure you so they know what's going on and it's so bold
[28:23.760 --> 28:32.440]  it's so crazy it's got so many angles it gives me a headache
[28:33.440 --> 28:37.520]  Interpol yeah I was moving with face scanning globally when you travel by the
[28:37.520 --> 28:43.280]  way Interpol's worldwide by the way the head of Interpol earlier this year said
[28:43.280 --> 28:46.480]  that they should arm everyone worldwide and that would stop Islamists
[28:46.480 --> 28:55.040]  attacking shopping malls and other facilities like the Parliament and the
[28:55.040 --> 28:58.960]  sad part about this is the West doesn't even differentiate radical Islamists
[28:58.960 --> 29:03.040]  from regular Muslims and there is a big difference most Muslims use when living
[29:03.040 --> 29:06.600]  peace they're always being attacked by jihadis being funded by the West and by
[29:06.600 --> 29:13.840]  Saudi Arabia and others and what stopped the bad guy up in Ottawa somebody with
[29:13.840 --> 29:19.720]  a gun but that all pales in significance and they're acting like it's the end of
[29:19.720 --> 29:27.440]  the world it's being called the news the battle of Ottawa two people dead
[29:27.440 --> 29:32.520]  meanwhile we talked to medical doctors and they tell us there's a cover-up going
[29:32.520 --> 29:36.880]  on we're going to talk to one of those doctors straight ahead on the other side

[33:31.240 --> 33:41.800]  I tell you the news that I've been gathering over the last few weeks is
[33:41.800 --> 33:50.200]  extremely painful I'm an American I'm a father of three children I live in Texas
[33:50.200 --> 34:00.480]  I have family in Dallas it's my hometown and in the last really two weeks we
[34:00.480 --> 34:05.960]  talked to dr. Edward group who was at a medical conference in Vegas who talked
[34:05.960 --> 34:10.760]  to senior members of the border patrol and ice who were there trying to find
[34:10.760 --> 34:15.080]  alternative treatments and ways to bolster the border patrol and ice's
[34:15.080 --> 34:21.840]  immune system and for their families and they brought up former deputy head of
[34:21.840 --> 34:29.080]  the border patrol and now the head of the retirees Union Zach Taylor and they
[34:29.080 --> 34:34.280]  said that his intel was that indeed they had CDC vehicles on the border and we're
[34:34.280 --> 34:37.920]  picking up people they believed had Ebola and we're whisking them away to
[34:37.920 --> 34:49.240]  unknown facilities then I was contacted by a medical doctor who manages a very
[34:49.240 --> 34:54.120]  large hospital that it has other hospitals outside of it I'll leave it
[34:54.120 --> 35:02.880]  at that who lived in Austin previously lives in another major Texas city I'll
[35:02.880 --> 35:07.840]  just say this it has a pro football team but I'm already saying too much the
[35:07.840 --> 35:12.680]  point is he said exactly what the gentleman is about to say right now and
[35:12.680 --> 35:17.360]  I was sitting on this for a week trying to talk to other medical doctors I know
[35:17.360 --> 35:21.320]  in major cities and they wouldn't talk to me they just said what you're hearing
[35:21.320 --> 35:24.840]  is what we're hearing and we've got what looks like confirmation of it but I
[35:24.840 --> 35:30.000]  don't you say you talk to me I don't want to lose my license or worse they
[35:30.000 --> 35:34.280]  are disappearing people now that's exactly what senior members of the
[35:34.280 --> 35:38.520]  current border patrol told us and we have those whistleblowers we were
[35:38.520 --> 35:42.720]  directed by some of these sources as you know three months ago the New York
[35:42.720 --> 35:48.800]  Times letter picked it up and admitted it was true to McAllen Texas then we're
[35:48.800 --> 35:54.720]  going to our guest where the border patrol was loading the illegals and their
[35:54.720 --> 35:58.560]  kids up on buses with vouchers into the rest of the country so our sources are
[35:58.560 --> 36:16.120]  good now we're joined by James Lorenzi and he works Dr. Lorenzi works at the
[36:16.120 --> 36:24.600]  Cass Regional Medical Center in Garden City, Missouri and he holds a DO and
[36:24.600 --> 36:28.920]  bachelor's degree in chemistry from Drury University and received his medical

[36:52.560 --> 36:58.080]  practitioners and it goes through all of that he joins us he's a doctor of
[36:58.080 --> 37:02.560]  osteopathic medicine which is another branch of the MDs and he's saying
[37:02.560 --> 37:09.400]  exactly what a major medical doctor that I know personally told me shaking with
[37:09.400 --> 37:14.800]  fear a week ago and this is why I have trouble even doing the broadcast why I've
[37:14.800 --> 37:19.280]  been very upset around the office is because we're trying to document all
[37:19.280 --> 37:23.240]  this and as we document it it's horrifying now he's got to leave he's
[37:23.240 --> 37:26.400]  got patients in 10 minutes so we're gonna go to him he'll be back on in the
[37:26.400 --> 37:29.840]  next few days for a full hour we want to encourage other medical doctors or
[37:29.840 --> 37:33.800]  medical workers to call in we can vet who you are either protect your identity
[37:33.800 --> 37:36.760]  or if you want to go public that's fine their strength and safety in numbers

[38:06.280 --> 38:11.600]  possibly having Ebola the hospitals were beginning to test for it well friend of
[38:11.600 --> 38:15.320]  mine that the resident at Truman Medical Center which is where I did my
[38:15.320 --> 38:19.960]  residency at called me and said hey you know we've got a we've got a possible
[38:19.960 --> 38:23.800]  Ebola patient here and he's leading out of all of it I'm not going to use the
[38:23.800 --> 38:27.920]  language to use but he's leading out of all of his orifices it's a septic shock
[38:27.920 --> 38:34.280]  hypotensive high fever he was visiting Africa he was from Africa I believe and
[38:34.280 --> 38:41.520]  had recently been here in the Kansas City area and excuse me they took care of
[38:41.520 --> 38:46.080]  them in the ICU course was not a rapid test so they weren't sure but they they
[38:46.080 --> 38:49.200]  I think they ordered the test and they started off but they moved them to the
[38:49.200 --> 38:55.680]  ICU and they put him in isolation from what my friend told me the following day
[38:55.680 --> 39:01.760]  he called me back and I told her let me know I was wanting to call your show
[39:01.760 --> 39:04.840]  I wanted to let people know though hey we've got a case here in Kansas City we
[39:04.840 --> 39:09.120]  called me back the next day and said they disappeared the patient that's what
[39:09.120 --> 39:13.760]  you mean they disappeared him the patient's gone they were told that he
[39:13.760 --> 39:18.800]  left AMA which means medical advice the guy was wasn't he couldn't even he
[39:18.800 --> 39:23.280]  wouldn't be able to leave I mean he's just not bad of a shape I said I'll look for
[39:23.280 --> 39:27.120]  John Joe which is the name that they use in hospitals in case you know that
[39:27.120 --> 39:30.360]  somebody's admitted that they don't know who you are and there was no John does
[39:30.360 --> 39:35.040]  in the hospital so the patient disappeared well the following day they
[39:35.040 --> 39:41.040]  had a meeting with anybody that had contact with that patient and said that
[39:41.040 --> 39:47.640]  he didn't have Ebola he had malaria well all of a sudden I that's when we heard
[39:47.640 --> 39:50.880]  that all these other cases in these other cities they were coming back and
[39:50.880 --> 39:54.640]  saying no they didn't have Ebola they had a malaria that seemed to like that was
[39:54.640 --> 39:59.840]  there that's what they were told to tell everybody well then we had a second
[39:59.840 --> 40:04.440]  patient at research medical center that was rumored to have because I have
[40:04.440 --> 40:08.000]  friends there too they call me so we have a possible bullet patient that
[40:08.000 --> 40:14.120]  patient disappeared there's a patient more recently a KU medical center which
[40:14.120 --> 40:20.480]  is just across the Kansas side about 20 minutes from here and that patient I
[40:20.480 --> 40:23.480]  don't know what the status of that patient is the big amount it says he didn't
[40:23.480 --> 40:29.880]  have the people of the day again typo it so there something is very very strange
[40:29.880 --> 40:33.800]  is going on and I wouldn't thought much about it but this happening in other
[40:33.800 --> 40:39.720]  areas of the country not only in this not only in Kansas City patients are
[40:39.720 --> 40:43.080]  disappearing they're doing something on the patient but and God knows where
[40:43.080 --> 40:49.200]  they're going well we have flights into Houston flights into New York from
[40:49.200 --> 40:53.000]  Nigeria that's the country the Ebola people are getting into to fly out
[40:53.000 --> 40:57.800]  that's the major airline hub they come from other African nations in most
[40:57.800 --> 41:02.440]  cases they dive vomiting on airplanes or they're found dead in pools of blood and
[41:02.440 --> 41:09.000]  vomit and feces not to get too detailed here in Houston and they're just told
[41:09.000 --> 41:13.680]  instantly Ebola ruled out before they even get the dead body off the plane in
[41:13.680 --> 41:18.360]  the case of JFK but the telltale sign is the medical people don't want to be
[41:18.360 --> 41:21.920]  around it the folks cleaning up the airplanes are on strike they're scared
[41:21.920 --> 41:25.920]  saying there's vomit all over the place it looks like there is a flood of
[41:25.920 --> 41:31.440]  refugees medical refugees out of West Africa here because other African
[41:31.440 --> 41:36.600]  countries won't let them in I mean undoubtedly if two nurses got Ebola
[41:36.600 --> 41:41.960]  from patient zero and then now they say it's all stopped when this guy was
[41:41.960 --> 41:45.200]  running around for a week and a half vomiting everywhere doctor does that
[41:45.200 --> 41:49.400]  make any sense to you I mean what you're saying what others are telling us is
[41:49.400 --> 41:53.240]  this is happening in Dallas you name it the same thing they come in they
[41:53.240 --> 41:58.520]  disappear him we have it from the border patrol that the same things going on do
[41:58.520 --> 42:02.320]  you think they're trying to cover this up so there won't be a panic if they were
[42:02.320 --> 42:09.760]  doing that why would they then not stop the flights I mean it'd be one thing of
[42:09.760 --> 42:14.320]  their disappearing people to army bases which they were supposed to begin with
[42:14.320 --> 42:18.440]  is just publicly take them there where they're level four that's the default but
[42:18.440 --> 42:22.360]  then why would they still let them come in and then let people that have it
[42:22.360 --> 42:26.240]  spread it and why would the CDC tell a nurse that treated an Ebola patient hey
[42:26.240 --> 42:31.680]  I have a fever is it okay if I fly to visit family and they tell her yes what
[42:31.680 --> 42:37.360]  does this sound like to you but there's several different areas I mean either
[42:37.360 --> 42:40.880]  they're deliberately trying to cause us to spread number one number two they
[42:40.880 --> 42:43.840]  don't want to cause a panic and there's over there's hundreds or thousands of
[42:43.840 --> 42:47.760]  people that already have it and it's just a matter of trying before that
[42:47.760 --> 42:51.280]  that people who are become aware of this they're trying to delay it as much as
[42:51.280 --> 42:59.440]  possible so they can get ready to try to deal with the panic or it makes no
[42:59.440 --> 43:04.720]  sense and we're told at our hospital that if we have a suspected Ebola patient to
[43:04.720 --> 43:10.600]  not use the word Ebola but not to say they have some type of viral
[43:10.600 --> 43:15.360]  illness put them in isolation but not to use that terminology with there are
[43:15.360 --> 43:18.920]  threatening people that you'll be fired you'll be like no you can use the word
[43:18.920 --> 43:23.440]  Ebola and another interesting thing I want to bring up Dr. Lorenzi stay there
[43:23.440 --> 43:27.760]  that is bombshell that just clicked they've been ordered in major cities two
[43:27.760 --> 43:33.480]  weeks ago on the police networks in New York the firefighters and others have
[43:33.480 --> 43:38.880]  been told do not use the word Ebola use code words and there's the daily mail
[43:38.880 --> 43:43.800]  headline for TV viewers so clearly we know there's a cover-up going on that's
[43:43.800 --> 43:48.720]  key proof right there that is amazing so you specifically and others have been
[43:48.720 --> 43:55.320]  told do not let people know there's an Ebola case absolutely okay please go
[43:55.320 --> 43:58.160]  to your next point excuse me
[43:58.160 --> 44:02.840]  well another interesting thing that I found out from several nurses and from
[44:02.840 --> 44:07.960]  drug reps that come to our hospital to my office they have contact with various
[44:07.960 --> 44:14.200]  people around the city and HDA which is one of the big hospitals for the
[44:14.200 --> 44:21.720]  company they went two days ago three days ago now they went and they took
[44:21.720 --> 44:27.880]  all of the secure protective equipment away from all the different
[44:27.880 --> 44:31.640]  departments without replacement with anything they took the N95 masks they
[44:31.640 --> 44:36.320]  took their whatever crappy equipment they have of us better nothing they took
[44:36.320 --> 44:40.640]  it all they have not replaced it with anything they were told that this is so
[44:40.640 --> 44:45.520]  they could have continuity of care or the possible involvement they just went
[44:45.520 --> 44:49.800]  there all off when they take it I don't know if they've done it HDA hospitals all
[44:49.800 --> 44:53.560]  around the country so I don't know if it's going on in other cities or not you
[44:53.560 --> 44:58.440]  are just dropping bombshell after bombshell so so it's fair we'll just
[44:58.440 --> 45:03.440]  basically have no protection or just wear a mask that is amazing
[45:03.440 --> 45:07.480]  they don't want to cause a panic they know something that we don't know yet
[45:07.480 --> 45:12.120]  it's a matter of time before it so they don't want people in spacesuits at
[45:12.120 --> 45:16.240]  hospitals even though it'll protect them because that would cause a panic it's
[45:16.240 --> 45:22.360]  all about the the image it's all about the optics right and we're told like I
[45:22.360 --> 45:27.040]  run two rural clinics outside of the hospital there are changes like you
[45:27.040 --> 45:32.840]  mentioned we say the infectious disease nor sent out these stupid little packets
[45:32.840 --> 45:39.000]  that they could pay it in 95 masks for booties gloves and a gown and told us
[45:39.000 --> 45:43.400]  that if we have a suspected a bullet case put this on and they told them the
[45:43.400 --> 45:47.240]  office staff to ask this is the screening process now that we're told to do
[45:47.240 --> 45:51.040]  ask them if they've traveled anywhere it's okay well if they have they've
[45:51.040 --> 45:55.400]  traveled to they came back from Africa then what well we don't know just ask
[45:55.400 --> 46:00.200]  them and that's the screening process that there were told to do at this point
[46:00.200 --> 46:05.040]  in time it's ridiculous at the toe yeah that's like you're telling somebody they
[46:05.040 --> 46:10.600]  can jump out of an airplane at 10,000 feet with an umbrella as a parachute
[46:10.600 --> 46:16.640]  I mean the reason I'm coming on here is I'm hoping to find out from other positions around the country or medical personnel
[46:16.640 --> 46:22.560]  is this going on just here is it just our hospitals at Kansas City we're just going on everywhere I think I
[46:22.560 --> 46:27.720]  already know what the answer to this but it's time to not be afraid I mean it's
[46:27.720 --> 46:32.040]  a piece of paper to medical license or if they pull a license for this so be it I
[46:32.040 --> 46:37.080]  mean we need to get this information out this is serious well that's right I mean
[46:37.080 --> 46:41.280]  they used to tell radio stations don't criticize the president or the FCC might
[46:41.280 --> 46:44.320]  take your license what is this Soviet Russia what happened to the first
[46:44.320 --> 46:50.600]  amendment and you shouldn't have to be part of a criminal conspiracy to cover
[46:50.600 --> 46:55.200]  up Ebola and lie to people that you should get an award for doing the right
[46:55.200 --> 46:59.640]  thing not be penalized but the right thing to do is the right thing to do
[46:59.640 --> 47:05.200]  and there's strength in numbers we need more people as you said to call in here
[47:05.200 --> 47:09.240]  in fact we have a guest coming up and he's a very important guest on the
[47:09.240 --> 47:16.720]  economy front Harry Dent I am tempted to try to move him to 1230 or move him to
[47:16.720 --> 47:20.640]  another day just because I need to open the phones up specifically this is such
[47:20.640 --> 47:23.880]  huge news it's even bigger than the economy because this will tank the
[47:23.880 --> 47:29.880]  economy if we don't get the word on on it but Dr. James Lorenzi thank you for
[47:29.880 --> 47:33.960]  for your courage specifically why do you think the other medical doctors we're
[47:33.960 --> 47:39.840]  talking to are scared to give their names and are saying they think they'll
[47:39.840 --> 47:44.320]  get their medical license pulled I mean what's a medical license worth if
[47:44.320 --> 47:50.040]  there's a pandemic and people lose their family to this I mean it was this
[47:50.040 --> 47:55.200]  attitude of doing whatever the feds say is going to kill this country this is
[47:55.200 --> 48:11.080]  insanity there's no other option that's been doing something like this
[48:11.080 --> 48:32.440]  well you're near a major city and so that's why you're also seeing in a lot
[48:32.440 --> 48:37.160]  of smaller towns or regions that aren't in the major thoroughfares probably
[48:37.160 --> 48:40.520]  haven't seen this hit yet in the few minutes we've got left with you doctor
[48:40.520 --> 48:44.240]  I want to get you back again tonight on the news if you can or tomorrow for
[48:44.240 --> 48:48.680]  another update and obviously Sunday but we are having a bunch of whistleblowers
[48:48.680 --> 48:53.320]  contact us in government you name it including Ebola screeners at airports
[48:53.320 --> 48:58.800]  it's just we have to process all that investigative material as well so it's
[48:58.800 --> 49:01.880]  important for people to continue to blow the whistle and blow the whistle to
[49:01.880 --> 49:06.120]  others because I think a lot of this is just ignorance but we do need whistle
[49:06.120 --> 49:10.200]  blowers to call in we didn't need them to confirm or deny this or give us more
[49:10.200 --> 49:13.840]  intel the problem is I've already confirmed what you're saying from folks
[49:13.840 --> 49:22.360]  in Texas anything else you'd like to add out there for listeners just be be
[49:22.360 --> 49:27.000]  aware be careful stay away from places where there's a large group of people I
[49:27.000 --> 49:30.240]  really think it's a much more serious than they're letting on whether this is
[49:30.240 --> 49:36.240]  really Ebola or something else something is going on there they're
[49:36.240 --> 49:42.240]  preparing for something and I think they're delaying the information coming
[49:42.240 --> 49:45.640]  out as long as possible because they're putting whatever system they're trying to
[49:45.640 --> 49:50.160]  put into place for whether it's the martial law situation or if they're
[49:50.160 --> 49:53.800]  gonna you know because some of those executive orders are bona fide takes
[49:53.800 --> 49:57.360]  over all medical personnel and I don't know if they're trying to get that set
[49:57.360 --> 50:02.520]  up I I don't know it's just keep your eyes and ears open and stay out of
[50:02.520 --> 50:06.320]  hospitals if you can that's the worst place in the world to be right now
[50:06.320 --> 50:11.560]  especially flu season coming around it's going to be a nightmare people are
[50:11.560 --> 50:14.680]  gonna be coming to the hospital for flu or Ebola or they don't know what they
[50:14.680 --> 50:18.720]  have and you know it can be around a bunch of other people it's gonna be a
[50:18.720 --> 50:25.200]  nightmare every doctor I spoke with is terrified of this this fall and let me
[50:25.200 --> 50:27.680]  ask you this we're gonna skip this network break I know you've got to go in
[50:27.680 --> 50:30.240]  just a few minutes but I'll keep as long as we can tell me when you've got to go
[50:30.240 --> 50:35.200]  the other key question what do the other medical doctors what do the nurses what
[50:35.200 --> 50:40.680]  do they think is going on is it a state of concern a state of not caring a
[50:40.680 --> 50:44.960]  state of panic of quiet panic what's going on well a lot of them come up to me
[50:44.960 --> 50:48.240]  and I said well I'll let you know when it's time to panic but they are very very
[50:48.240 --> 50:53.600]  concerned and several nurses and other personnel I've spoken with their families
[50:53.600 --> 50:58.760]  and come up to me say hey we have an Ebola case but I'm not coming to work I'm
[50:58.760 --> 51:02.880]  staying home I'm taking care of my family and especially when you don't have
[51:02.880 --> 51:08.240]  the right gear correct correct there's and there's been no training at the
[51:08.240 --> 51:11.760]  hospital there's been no and I call the infection to these nurses that what
[51:11.760 --> 51:16.000]  listen we do we need to practice this scenario we need to know where to go
[51:16.000 --> 51:19.520]  where's the gear at all we've got it covered don't worry about it and they
[51:19.520 --> 51:23.040]  don't and nobody everybody's freaking out all it looks like nobody knows what to
[51:23.040 --> 51:29.720]  do so there is a sense of panic is slowly occurring at least our hospital I
[51:29.720 --> 51:34.280]  can't speak for the other hospital but the drug reps are actually I'm getting a
[51:34.280 --> 51:37.360]  lot of information from them because they go around we see the same reps all
[51:37.360 --> 51:42.240]  the time and kind of develop a personal relationship with them and they go around
[51:42.240 --> 51:45.600]  and talk to other doctors and they're telling me the same thing that's all
[51:45.600 --> 51:49.280]  they're talking about that's all patients are asking about their company
[51:49.280 --> 51:54.560]  and ask us to talk what do we do I don't know it's a colloidal silver I feel
[51:54.560 --> 51:59.400]  that's the only thing I know that's gonna help you and it's an N95 vaccine stay away
[51:59.400 --> 52:05.720]  from public places but people are very concerned about it so in your medical
[52:05.720 --> 52:10.480]  opinion you think there's some evidence showing the colloidal silver is a good
[52:10.480 --> 52:17.120]  alternative antibiotic absolutely because I actually have a generator that I
[52:17.120 --> 52:20.560]  purchased from my old name where I got it from but I spoke with a guy that made
[52:20.560 --> 52:25.920]  it and he's got some information there's actually a US Army study that I pulled
[52:25.920 --> 52:31.880]  that shows that it does kill Ebola they tested back and I think it was in the
[52:31.880 --> 52:35.840]  80s that anybody can search for and find it
[52:35.840 --> 52:44.000]  colloidal silver does kill Ebola it kills as well as a flu virus and any other
[52:44.000 --> 52:48.400]  virus that maybe silver has always been known I mean sunlight kills it too the
[52:48.400 --> 52:52.120]  question is that can it get in there I mean I don't think we can say from my
[52:52.120 --> 52:56.040]  view but I'm not a medical doctor like you that I that it I mean certainly it
[52:56.040 --> 52:59.920]  could be alternative treatment has a lot of promising things that it's shown and
[52:59.920 --> 53:05.280]  I know government itself has been buying heavily into it while demonizing
[53:05.280 --> 53:09.160]  anybody that tries to talk about any alternative treatment I mean it was well
[53:09.160 --> 53:12.840]  known back during the black plague that lots of garlic and vitamin C they didn't
[53:12.840 --> 53:17.680]  know what vitamin C was but fruit helped people you know not get it because it
[53:17.680 --> 53:21.520]  boosted their immune system and that's all we're here talking about is
[53:21.520 --> 53:28.640]  obviously staying away from airports if you can staying away from international
[53:28.640 --> 53:35.040]  hubs and quite frankly West Africans coming off airplanes that's a no-brainer
[53:35.040 --> 53:41.120]  when they're set to have a million-plus cases over there and it's just
[53:41.120 --> 53:47.320]  absolutely vital that we all be vigilant and I think get the word out here
[53:47.320 --> 53:51.240]  because if there is a concern not a panic then they'll shut down the flights
[53:51.240 --> 53:57.200]  because if Ebola isn't exponentially spreading doc if more flights pour in
[53:57.200 --> 54:00.520]  and the World Health Organization estimates that more Ebola flights will
[54:00.520 --> 54:04.400]  end up getting into Western countries why then if they admit that would they
[54:04.400 --> 54:08.320]  allow that to continue with something that kills 70% of people what's your
[54:08.320 --> 54:13.160]  view on that because it's gonna prove that his open border policy is a
[54:13.160 --> 54:17.680]  failure in contributing to this and he can directly correlate that to Obama's
[54:17.680 --> 54:22.760]  policy and he would truly be you know Ebola as we like to call it now I think
[54:22.760 --> 54:28.080]  that's the main reason and the only alternative is that they're trying they
[54:28.080 --> 54:31.520]  want people to get infected they want they need this to occur this is their
[54:31.520 --> 54:35.640]  next big crisis you know don't let a crisis go to waste type of a scenario
[54:35.640 --> 54:39.440]  and the CDC can play with their with their toys they can go out and they can
[54:39.440 --> 54:43.960]  implement the protocols they can they can get their airtime they can you know
[54:43.960 --> 54:48.440]  they can be the saviors of the country but by then it's gonna be too late I
[54:48.440 --> 54:54.120]  think Dr. James Lorenzi thank you so much we're gonna give you my cell phone
[54:54.120 --> 54:58.080]  number as you leave here please give it to him guys we're gonna give you Anthony
[54:58.080 --> 55:04.040]  Gutiarty cell Nico Acosta's cell so that you can get in contact with us
[55:04.040 --> 55:09.960]  because we've had other whistleblowers before that you know had had had some
[55:09.960 --> 55:13.320]  pretty serious repercussions the fact that we're talking to you openly though
[55:13.320 --> 55:16.760]  the fact that you put your name out I think protects you to a great extent in
[55:16.760 --> 55:21.160]  my experience it's folks that don't give their name they use the NSA to figure
[55:21.160 --> 55:24.680]  out who was on and then threaten them I think the fact that what you're doing so
[55:24.680 --> 55:28.840]  moral and most people even in the government agree with you we should
[55:28.840 --> 55:33.120]  all say a prayer for you a prayer for this nation but as Mark Twain said in the
[55:33.120 --> 55:36.560]  beginning of Patriots a scarce man hated feared and scorned but in time when
[55:36.560 --> 55:39.560]  his cause succeeds the timid joined him because then it cost nothing to be a
[55:39.560 --> 55:43.880]  patriot thank you for what you've done for my family thank you for what you've
[55:43.880 --> 55:47.600]  done for all of us and your courage because we know a lot of border patrol
[55:47.600 --> 55:52.680]  people a lot of medical people who are saying the exact same thing including
[55:52.680 --> 55:56.440]  people that have seen it happen in their hospital in a major Texas city and
[55:56.440 --> 56:00.160]  they're scared to come on and I'm glad they even called me that that took more
[56:00.160 --> 56:04.720]  courage but you you are the equivalent in the Info War of our Audie Murphy
[56:04.720 --> 56:08.960]  coming on here sir so just God bless you doctor well thank you very much and
[56:08.960 --> 56:13.480]  keep up the great work I really enjoy what you do God bless you God bless you
[56:13.480 --> 56:17.520]  well we're all in this together you know I went and saw last night fury with Brad
[56:17.520 --> 56:22.440]  Pitt and I knew a lot of World War two Sherman tankers who I hunted with when
[56:22.440 --> 56:25.640]  I was a kid they're all dead now and I'd always try to get them to tell me war
[56:25.640 --> 56:29.240]  stories they'd say kid imagine a beautiful blonde that looks like Marilyn
[56:29.240 --> 56:33.360]  Rowe walks up with a trench coat opens it up and starts shooting at you with a
[56:33.360 --> 56:37.280]  machine gun and you cut her in half now let's go hunting but don't ask me any
[56:37.280 --> 56:43.920]  more war stories and so the movies very accurate from a lot of the reports I've
[56:43.920 --> 56:48.840]  gotten and things and and and what it was like over there and it's the story is
[56:48.840 --> 56:53.640]  Audie Murphy through North Africa into Italy into Germany and the character is
[56:53.640 --> 56:56.520]  Audie Murphy and the reason I'm talking about this is that was a real Audie Murphy
[56:56.520 --> 57:00.920]  we just talked to in the info war it takes more courage historically to do
[57:00.920 --> 57:04.200]  something that's not even military when you're being backed and pulled it's
[57:04.200 --> 57:08.560]  okay then do something against the grain in your own country and they ripped off
[57:08.560 --> 57:11.960]  Audie Murphy it's the story of Audie Murphy except it was one guy killing
[57:11.960 --> 57:18.600]  300 people at a crossroads against a bunch of SS and Germans and
[57:18.600 --> 57:24.880]  half-tracks it was Audie Murphy and he didn't get killed and it's just that's
[57:24.880 --> 57:29.080]  how screwed up Hollywood is is that it looks like Audie Murphy you know
[57:29.080 --> 57:34.000]  Audie Murphy look like Brad Pitt or he looks like him it is Audie Murphy and
[57:34.000 --> 57:39.600]  they don't give him credit it's sick and they've got him getting killed at the
[57:39.600 --> 57:44.120]  end it's just it's everything's twisted when they should at least say some of
[57:44.120 --> 57:49.120]  this is based on Audie Murphy but I didn't see that and I don't know why I
[57:49.120 --> 57:52.880]  just digressed off into that it's just that we need people to have the moral
[57:52.880 --> 57:56.600]  courage to stand up for this country now or lose everything where are the men
[57:56.600 --> 58:04.160]  out there well we just talked to one of them Dr. James Lorenzi and he's like
[58:04.160 --> 58:08.600]  thanking me for what I do hey we're trying to self-preserve here we're
[58:08.600 --> 58:11.640]  trying to do the same thing I don't deserve to be thanked this is what I do
[58:11.640 --> 58:15.480]  this is what I said I wanted to do said I wanted to fight tyranny I wanted the
[58:15.480 --> 58:19.720]  truth the whole truth I pray to God every day to sanctify me to lead God and
[58:19.720 --> 58:23.920]  direct me because I am a wicked devil and then I'd be used as a vessel I've
[58:23.920 --> 58:28.280]  tried to turn myself over to God and just this is what I was born to do and I
[58:28.280 --> 58:32.120]  know you were born to do this as well but I'll tell you folks we shouldn't be
[58:32.120 --> 58:35.520]  thanked for what we're doing we should be thanking God for giving us the
[58:35.520 --> 58:40.600]  guidance because this is the time to call on God we'll be back stay with us

[01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:11.480]  away and they've talked to the medical drug raps who go around to all the
[01:01:11.480 --> 01:01:16.880]  hospitals and they say it's happening at a lot of big medical facilities so I was
[01:01:16.880 --> 01:01:20.920]  trying to say hey clearly we hope there's not a lot of Ebola cases but why are
[01:01:20.920 --> 01:01:28.400]  they bringing people in I know another medical doctor MD you know that dinner

[01:03:51.120 --> 01:03:56.120]  and so I got my reporters trying to produce the nightly news and trying to
[01:03:56.120 --> 01:03:58.520]  write articles about the same time trying to go over all this this is
[01:03:58.520 --> 01:04:06.960]  journalism 101 how will Obama and the globalists get away with this one I'm
[01:04:06.960 --> 01:04:10.280]  trying to figure out a way this isn't true or this isn't right or that there's
[01:04:10.280 --> 01:04:14.320]  something else that makes you bleed out every orifice and but why would they
[01:04:14.320 --> 01:04:17.440]  whisk them away and cover it up I'm trying to ignore the border patrol I'm
[01:04:17.440 --> 01:04:23.520]  trying to ignore senior agent Zach Taylor I'm trying to ignore the intel the
[01:04:23.520 --> 01:04:27.880]  common sense my lying eyes my gut everything we've seen the flight still
[01:04:27.880 --> 01:04:33.880]  coming in people dying vomiting on the planes the airport cleanup crews going
[01:04:33.880 --> 01:04:38.480]  on strike three weeks ago because they know what we know but everything points
[01:04:38.480 --> 01:04:44.280]  towards Ebola and the media is attacking me for daring to be pointing all this
[01:04:44.280 --> 01:04:48.760]  out I'm sure there'll be a price to pay for telling the truth but that's our
[01:04:48.760 --> 01:04:53.640]  job I'm not even afraid of the system coming after me I'm just afraid of what
[01:04:53.640 --> 01:04:57.120]  they'll do to the innocence in this country I mean somebody's got to stop
[01:04:57.120 --> 01:05:02.880]  these people we'll be back the government's Department of Homeland

[01:08:10.440 --> 01:08:31.280]  we're back we're broadcasting worldwide I am your host Alex Jones if you just
[01:08:31.280 --> 01:08:37.720]  joined us I'm gonna recap and then go to your phone calls this is probably one
[01:08:37.720 --> 01:08:43.440]  of the most important broadcasts I've ever done little more on a week ago a
[01:08:43.440 --> 01:08:52.840]  very successful medical doctor that I know that manages a group of hospitals
[01:08:52.840 --> 01:09:02.920]  big ones in a major city in Texas told one of my associates that had first
[01:09:02.920 --> 01:09:10.840]  introduced me to this gentleman about a year ago that there are people that have
[01:09:10.840 --> 01:09:15.480]  Ebola like symptoms bleeding out of every orifice in hospitals in major
[01:09:15.480 --> 01:09:21.920]  Texas cities that are being disappeared the fed show up there's no record they
[01:09:21.920 --> 01:09:24.520]  just whisk them away which the hospitals aren't supposed to do that's
[01:09:24.520 --> 01:09:28.880]  violation of federal and state law and there's not even a record in the
[01:09:28.880 --> 01:09:37.160]  hospital it's expunged I then had a chance to talk to this individual about
[01:09:37.160 --> 01:09:40.320]  it and then I reached out to some other medical doctors and people and they
[01:09:40.320 --> 01:09:45.600]  said yes that's what's going on they even name some of the hospitals well all
[01:09:45.600 --> 01:09:50.360]  of them said don't say what city I'm in and don't say my name or they will pull
[01:09:50.360 --> 01:09:56.040]  my license or worse but you should be scared you should get your family ready
[01:09:56.040 --> 01:10:03.480]  well Anthony good she already talked about this yesterday when he was on in
[01:10:03.480 --> 01:10:11.280]  this hour with David Knight well I've been busy behind the scenes trying to
[01:10:11.280 --> 01:10:16.520]  research all this I mean this is big news folks this is this is type of stuff
[01:10:16.520 --> 01:10:21.240]  makes you get sick at your stomach I don't mean that as a double entendre that
[01:10:21.240 --> 01:10:26.720]  Ebola gives you a stomachache I mean I've I don't get anxiety when 10 cops you
[01:10:26.720 --> 01:10:29.320]  know jump out of a van and run up and say they're gonna arrest me in New York
[01:10:29.320 --> 01:10:32.720]  because I'm covering a demonstration and threaten to beat my brains in I've been
[01:10:32.720 --> 01:10:36.440]  arrested you know repeatedly in New York I'm not saying I'm a tough guy you've
[01:10:36.440 --> 01:10:39.760]  seen footage of troops jumping out of a vehicle and running up with guns saying
[01:10:39.760 --> 01:10:42.440]  turn your cameras off and I tell him I'm not going to I mean I just I don't have
[01:10:42.440 --> 01:10:48.600]  anxiety and I've been the point of basically throwing up from anxiety
[01:10:48.600 --> 01:10:53.080]  that's how real this is okay because it's not just that I'm scared of Ebola
[01:10:53.080 --> 01:10:56.960]  and have three children it gets you real deep when you got little kids and this
[01:10:56.960 --> 01:11:00.320]  is going on why would the government bring in more flights why are they
[01:11:00.320 --> 01:11:04.800]  covering things up it's not just to stop a panic they want to get it going
[01:11:04.800 --> 01:11:08.840]  before the big panic sets in they've done everything they can to cause the
[01:11:08.840 --> 01:11:18.160]  maximum disaster and then Dr. James Lorenzi who works at Cass Regional
[01:11:18.160 --> 01:11:22.600]  Medical Center we called him yesterday called him today confirm called him
[01:11:22.600 --> 01:11:26.760]  there at his offices he was just on with us we called him got him you know get
[01:11:26.760 --> 01:11:31.280]  us Dr. Lorenzi on they go and get him that's how we document things we don't
[01:11:31.280 --> 01:11:38.160]  just we got a federal marshal whistleblower it's a little different
[01:11:38.160 --> 01:11:41.080]  because you can't call up say is this your federal marshal you just have to
[01:11:41.080 --> 01:11:44.080]  fair it around and check it and then confirm it and call the numbers on the
[01:11:44.080 --> 01:11:47.680]  documents and get threatened by the feds that you have secret documents and you
[01:11:47.680 --> 01:11:51.520]  know why do you have those give those to us right now I mean that's you that you
[01:11:51.520 --> 01:11:55.960]  have to vet things as a journalist we vetted him and I got a sick feeling when
[01:11:55.960 --> 01:11:59.520]  we called the hospital and got him on the line
[01:12:01.120 --> 01:12:04.480]  and he knew we were gonna call and do that a lot of times we have whistleblowers
[01:12:04.480 --> 01:12:08.520]  send us their military IDs you name it and it's got the point where they have
[01:12:08.520 --> 01:12:11.960]  to mail them to us now because they'll they'll they'll intercept them on the
[01:12:11.960 --> 01:12:15.400]  internet and then go harass them or worse this is serious it's like Matt
[01:12:15.400 --> 01:12:19.960]  dredge said a few years ago you got to now meet your sources like deep throat
[01:12:19.960 --> 01:12:27.560]  from the whole Watergate situation with Nixon in parking garages I actually
[01:12:27.560 --> 01:12:33.640]  meet people in parking garages you know why they do that because they don't have
[01:12:33.640 --> 01:12:39.400]  GPS into a parking garage doesn't shoot through the concrete and the old days
[01:12:39.400 --> 01:12:41.880]  you just met in the parking garage because it was a place where you couldn't
[01:12:41.880 --> 01:12:47.400]  be seen by satellite where your cars were parked by each other so I'm living
[01:12:47.400 --> 01:12:51.840]  in the middle of a spy movie and you are too I mean this is really going on
[01:12:51.840 --> 01:12:57.920]  this is really happening and if you're not concerned and freaked out something's
[01:12:57.920 --> 01:13:03.240]  wrong with you so we're open the phones up to medical workers medical doctors
[01:13:03.240 --> 01:13:08.520]  you name it to talk about what Dr. James Lorenzi told us and he named the
[01:13:08.520 --> 01:13:14.360]  medical centers he named what's happening and how people are being
[01:13:14.360 --> 01:13:18.760]  disappeared by the feds that come in and grab them and wheel them off and that's
[01:13:18.760 --> 01:13:23.640]  exactly what the head of the retiree Border Patrol Union said we talked to
[01:13:23.640 --> 01:13:27.760]  senior Border Patrol and ICE officials and they said we've seen this but Zach
[01:13:27.760 --> 01:13:33.600]  Taylor's retired you can talk to him he's who we give the intel to basically and
[01:13:33.600 --> 01:13:37.640]  so we got Zach Taylor on he said yeah no they got vans they're grabbing people
[01:13:37.640 --> 01:13:42.000]  that was October 10th so you understand this is confirmed basically the reason
[01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:46.040]  I'm freaked out at this point it's pretty much confirmed there's a hope and a
[01:13:46.040 --> 01:13:50.080]  prayer that there's something else making people bleed out but why would the
[01:13:50.080 --> 01:13:54.880]  feds be covering it up okay that's all I can say
[01:13:54.880 --> 01:13:59.080]  Louise is a dental assistant once talk about Ebola yeah that's folks that would
[01:13:59.080 --> 01:14:04.400]  see it Susan Missouri medical technologist that's all the equipment
[01:14:04.400 --> 01:14:08.760]  steves and mass staff nurse at hospital Sharers and Texas friend works for
[01:14:08.760 --> 01:14:13.360]  hospital so we'll go just in order Sue in Missouri thanks for calling do you
[01:14:13.360 --> 01:14:18.280]  have any information for us first of all I just want to say thank you Alex and
[01:14:18.280 --> 01:14:23.120]  your team you're doing a great job I just wish that I could get more people to
[01:14:23.120 --> 01:14:34.600]  listen the thought that they're pulling the protective equipment you know not
[01:14:34.600 --> 01:14:41.480]  letting people get the protective equipment my idea about that is okay
[01:14:41.480 --> 01:14:46.680]  what's the bottom line usually what's the bottom line it's the dollar okay
[01:14:46.680 --> 01:14:50.400]  what do they have out there in the wings that they want to give to everybody
[01:14:50.400 --> 01:14:55.120]  okay so if they take the protective equipment away from the medical workers
[01:14:55.120 --> 01:15:01.160]  what's their next line of defense by the way he you know he mentions the
[01:15:01.160 --> 01:15:06.680]  hospital corporation of America which is the biggest hospital chain and my dad's
[01:15:06.680 --> 01:15:11.160]  even done work with them and as a medical consultant and he said they're
[01:15:11.160 --> 01:15:15.800]  taking their gear away so it's quote all equal no it's so they don't create a
[01:15:15.800 --> 01:15:19.680]  panic well that's criminal to take the the gear away I mean that's like taking
[01:15:19.680 --> 01:15:24.440]  cops guns away this is just in this is insane want the people to say give me
[01:15:24.440 --> 01:15:30.080]  the vaccine so if the medical workers take the vaccine then the rest of the
[01:15:30.080 --> 01:15:34.840]  people are going to think the vaccine's okay to take I think they're doing it
[01:15:34.840 --> 01:15:39.000]  because they want people they're gonna make the nurses and the doctors take the
[01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:43.040]  damn vaccine oh that's it just like with flu they take right they're gonna
[01:15:43.040 --> 01:15:45.840]  they're gonna they're taking their equipment away so now we know we have
[01:15:45.840 --> 01:15:51.080]  no protection when we go to a patient's room or we have no protection I work in
[01:15:51.080 --> 01:15:58.160]  the laboratory so we have no protection when we work in the lab so I think
[01:15:58.160 --> 01:16:01.920]  they're taking it away because they the next thing the nurses will have to do is
[01:16:01.920 --> 01:16:06.200]  what give me the vaccine very well said thank you so we'll see if we get the
[01:16:06.200 --> 01:16:10.080]  intel from Steve and mass staff nurse at a hospital Steve do you have any
[01:16:10.080 --> 01:16:16.080]  information on this hi can you hear me Alex yes sir hi Alex I've been a
[01:16:16.080 --> 01:16:19.480]  registered nurse for about seven years my wife's also a nurse here in
[01:16:19.480 --> 01:16:23.640]  Massachusetts and if this thing gets here I mean it's gonna be a nightmare you
[01:16:23.640 --> 01:16:27.840]  know you have people waiting 12 hours in the emergency room piled on top of each
[01:16:27.840 --> 01:16:31.800]  other before they can even see a doctor you know that's plenty of time for the
[01:16:31.800 --> 01:16:35.880]  Ebola to spread or you know some patients the patients are patients the nurses
[01:16:35.880 --> 01:16:39.800]  that's what they say is the waiting room is the most dangerous place in America
[01:16:39.800 --> 01:16:43.440]  right now yes and there's you know there's maybe three negative pressure
[01:16:43.440 --> 01:16:49.280]  rooms maybe in each emergency room and what the first caller said about the
[01:16:49.280 --> 01:16:52.680]  flu shot what I'd encourage all healthcare workers to do is refuse it
[01:16:52.680 --> 01:16:56.440]  then they'll make you wear a mask and you know probably be safer than taking the
[01:16:56.440 --> 01:17:01.880]  flu vaccine anyway do you have any information on what this doctor said
[01:17:01.880 --> 01:17:05.840]  earlier and what the medical doctors I've talked to her saying I do know that
[01:17:05.840 --> 01:17:10.320]  they have started training in one out of seven hospitals for Ebola but it was
[01:17:10.320 --> 01:17:14.960]  merely a 15-minute in-service where they put a mask on and down no protective
[01:17:14.960 --> 01:17:21.160]  equipment for the eyes like like someone said the other week to be in 95 isn't
[01:17:21.160 --> 01:17:24.920]  the appropriate mask for Ebola that you need something bigger like the N100 and
[01:17:24.920 --> 01:17:28.240]  I encourage all healthcare workers to buy it for themselves and use it at work
[01:17:28.240 --> 01:17:33.480]  exactly thank you so much Bobby's a New York City firefighter and that's in the
[01:17:33.480 --> 01:17:37.920]  New York Post and the New York Times they've been told do not use the word
[01:17:37.920 --> 01:17:42.440]  Ebola over your radios so that's that's evidence of the pre-preparation for
[01:17:42.440 --> 01:17:47.240]  cover-up what's your information Bobby thanks for calling hey I do a man long
[01:17:47.240 --> 01:17:53.520]  time listener first time call welcome be honest you are working to Bronx I have
[01:17:53.520 --> 01:17:57.080]  really heard anything about that maybe the dispatches have gone that
[01:17:57.080 --> 01:18:01.680]  information sure because we get we get very limited information at the at the
[01:18:01.680 --> 01:18:07.080]  firehouse sure to speak but I mean other than that we haven't heard any
[01:18:07.080 --> 01:18:10.480]  information about that sure well we just put the New York Post up on screen
[01:18:10.480 --> 01:18:15.560]  what's your take on all this well I could tell you at the firehouse level we
[01:18:15.560 --> 01:18:21.680]  barely have all the any information about Ebola I mean they give us these
[01:18:21.680 --> 01:18:28.480]  baseline you know suits which basically are just for like you know projectile
[01:18:28.480 --> 01:18:35.240]  vomit like we very often we do CPR and such but as far as far as the Ebola goes
[01:18:35.240 --> 01:18:40.560]  no we're not equipped at all there's no question we're not equipped what do you
[01:18:40.560 --> 01:18:45.880]  think of what Dr. James Lorenzi was saying earlier I'm see I miss most of
[01:18:45.880 --> 01:18:50.880]  interview but I'm sure I'm sure it's it's part of course what he was saying I
[01:18:50.880 --> 01:18:54.200]  mean he was named in the hospital where they have people that look like they're
[01:18:54.200 --> 01:18:57.840]  down of Ebola being disappeared by the feds and he's talked to other doctors and
[01:18:57.840 --> 01:19:01.960]  they say it's it's going on other areas and I know a major doctor in Texas saying
[01:19:01.960 --> 01:19:06.800]  the same thing yeah I mean we're walking into we're walking into stuff where like
[01:19:06.800 --> 01:19:10.680]  we would even though we're getting involved like we get a ticket at the
[01:19:10.680 --> 01:19:15.240]  firehouse which is the you know the call you know someone called 911 and we get
[01:19:15.240 --> 01:19:20.040]  we get a ticket at the firehouse and we barely even know we're getting into
[01:19:20.040 --> 01:19:26.080]  they have this system implemented it's called UCT unified cold taker basic
[01:19:26.080 --> 01:19:30.720]  just basic information what do we know we're getting into yeah I've read that a
[01:19:30.720 --> 01:19:34.240]  lot of these centralized Homeland Security code systems now are not
[01:19:34.240 --> 01:19:38.720]  allowing real communication because it dumbs down the communication and and
[01:19:38.720 --> 01:19:42.080]  takes the local control away never a good idea in my view thank you Bobby be
[01:19:42.080 --> 01:19:45.200]  safe up there remember the deadly dust and the firefighters and they said it
[01:19:45.200 --> 01:19:48.120]  was safe to breathe when their internal documents said it was deadly

[01:25:34.800 --> 01:25:40.360]  they told you please basically this happened maybe about three or four weeks
[01:25:40.360 --> 01:25:45.720]  ago in this hospital that somebody came in there with Ebola like symptoms but
[01:25:45.720 --> 01:25:51.480]  basically what a bull down to is that they were stated to have malaria and I
[01:25:51.480 --> 01:25:54.880]  just everything that's been going on that you've been covering about everybody
[01:25:54.880 --> 01:26:00.200]  else supposedly having malaria over Ebola is just it's just that's what the
[01:26:00.200 --> 01:26:05.560]  major Texas City doctor told me I'm coming I just want to I want to give
[01:26:05.560 --> 01:26:08.640]  out the info that I'm sworn to shut up and then the other fellow who confirmed
[01:26:08.640 --> 01:26:12.640]  his identity up in Missouri that's what they're being told and the doctors are
[01:26:12.640 --> 01:26:16.560]  all malaria doesn't make you bleed out of your eyeballs in your rear end
[01:26:16.560 --> 01:26:20.360]  malaria makes you get the chills and shrivel up and lose weight I mean this
[01:26:20.360 --> 01:26:24.200]  is incredible so so so that's what they told you was that they thought something
[01:26:24.200 --> 01:26:30.920]  was going on yes and they thought that that was weird you know also what you
[01:26:30.920 --> 01:26:34.160]  know what everybody else has been saying about the doctors of losing their
[01:26:34.160 --> 01:26:37.880]  protective gear and stuff well they don't nobody ever talks about the people
[01:26:37.880 --> 01:26:44.120]  that have to go in and clean up after these patients like in in the ER or and
[01:26:44.120 --> 01:26:48.440]  you know what I mean like sure sure I mean the janitorial service with one
[01:26:48.440 --> 01:26:53.640]  Ebola patient in Dallas they had bloody bandages and stuff quote piled to the
[01:26:53.640 --> 01:26:58.040]  ceiling God bless you thank you for the call Joe in Texas who's a medical
[01:26:58.040 --> 01:27:06.880]  worker listening on KDAV 1590 AM go ahead welcome to the airwaves yes I will
[01:27:06.880 --> 01:27:10.920]  try to make this as brief as possible however I'm not sure that I'm not sure
[01:27:10.920 --> 01:27:17.480]  if I can the point I wanted to make though is big pharmacy cannot do a
[01:27:17.480 --> 01:27:22.440]  double blind study on an Ebola treatment so they're working in conjunction with
[01:27:22.440 --> 01:27:30.280]  the CDC to spread this as wide as possible before true panic in instills
[01:27:30.280 --> 01:27:35.560]  the country and then they can actually test their treatments it's all the
[01:27:35.560 --> 01:27:41.520]  dollar signs with the government and big pharmacy well that's for sure that they
[01:27:41.520 --> 01:27:45.280]  stand the game from it but they must think we're dumb if this gets out of
[01:27:45.280 --> 01:27:50.520]  hand and then they let it happen I mean they just must think they're above the
[01:27:50.520 --> 01:27:54.680]  law totally invincible folks are gonna be mad when kids are dead I'm telling you
[01:27:54.680 --> 01:27:59.640]  I've had enough of this trying to downplay as much as possible so that
[01:27:59.640 --> 01:28:05.240]  people will continue with their normal lives and be carriers and spread it so
[01:28:05.240 --> 01:28:10.320]  they can actually do a true study on a treatment and where are you specifically
[01:28:10.320 --> 01:28:14.800]  and I know the station you're calling from where are you I am currently in
[01:28:14.800 --> 01:28:19.200]  Lubbock Texas and what are the other medical workers you talk to I mean do
[01:28:19.200 --> 01:28:25.400]  they agree with you or what's their tag they they are terrified that the that the
[01:28:25.400 --> 01:28:30.840]  CDC is kind of blowing this off in the country they're take they're taking it
[01:28:30.840 --> 01:28:36.440]  seriously in Africa but they're not protecting our own citizens because they
[01:28:36.440 --> 01:28:41.320]  want to they want to do their government spitting they want to bring this
[01:28:41.320 --> 01:28:47.240]  country down to make a bunch of money yeah yeah yes I am so sick of it well
[01:28:47.240 --> 01:28:52.040]  God bless you thank you for the call Corey in Wisconsin a police officer got

[01:33:23.800 --> 01:33:27.920]  on a day it was something this important happening but I didn't cancel Harry
[01:33:27.920 --> 01:33:33.600]  Dent because he's making a lot of accurate predictions on the economy and
[01:33:33.600 --> 01:33:36.680]  what would start happening the stock market he was on list a few months ago
[01:33:36.680 --> 01:33:41.680]  and predicted that it would start going down and he predicted some other things
[01:33:41.680 --> 01:33:45.880]  that are starting to unfold so I wanted to get him on we moved him up 30 minutes
[01:33:45.880 --> 01:33:52.320]  or back 30 minutes because obviously I've talked to a major medical doctor who I
[01:33:52.320 --> 01:33:58.320]  know personally who manages a very large hospital in a group of hospitals who
[01:33:58.320 --> 01:34:03.400]  said they're definitely disappearing people that are bleeding out we believe
[01:34:03.400 --> 01:34:08.880]  with Ebola and the feds are coming and taking them away we then interviewed last
[01:34:08.880 --> 01:34:12.560]  week confirming this agent Zach Taylor former deputy head of the board patrol
[01:34:12.560 --> 01:34:17.400]  now the head of their union and he said this has been going on for months on the
[01:34:17.400 --> 01:34:31.520]  southern border so very very suspicious then Dr. James Larazzini at Cass
[01:34:31.520 --> 01:34:36.160]  Regional Medical Center in Garden City Missouri contacted us we contacted him
[01:34:36.160 --> 01:34:40.280]  back called him got him on at the hospital had him on from via his cell
[01:34:40.280 --> 01:34:46.640]  phone after that last hour saying naming the medical centers naming where
[01:34:46.640 --> 01:34:49.840]  people are bleeding out and then they're just disappeared by the feds
[01:34:49.840 --> 01:34:54.560]  nothing is signed out it's incredible and they're basically threatening people
[01:34:54.560 --> 01:34:58.280]  not to talk about we've had police officers calling and confirming it's
[01:34:58.280 --> 01:35:01.640]  been in the New York Post and you name it that they're telling firefighters and
[01:35:01.640 --> 01:35:05.760]  police don't use on the dispatch the word Ebola and then we have a police
[01:35:05.760 --> 01:35:09.800]  officer Corey in Wisconsin who got cut off by the break spend a minute sir just
[01:35:09.800 --> 01:35:15.800]  recap you're a EMT slash police officer what you're being told what they're
[01:35:15.800 --> 01:35:20.400]  saying what the codes are and what their reasons are for that please sir yeah
[01:35:20.400 --> 01:35:24.880]  Alex we got a memo about a week ago stating that if we are dispatched to
[01:35:24.880 --> 01:35:29.200]  somebody who has a fever the dispatcher will ask questions specifically if they've
[01:35:29.200 --> 01:35:33.760]  been to Africa or West Africa if they have a fever 104 things like that if
[01:35:33.760 --> 01:35:38.240]  those questions are answered yes we will then be dispatched along with the ALS
[01:35:38.240 --> 01:35:45.760]  this is advanced life support unit along with the battalion we have positive
[01:35:45.760 --> 01:35:50.320]  answers to additional screening questions which is called for possible
[01:35:50.320 --> 01:35:55.400]  Ebola at that point our police department has said that we will not enter
[01:35:55.400 --> 01:35:59.000]  this team and the fire department itself has told us that they may not even
[01:35:59.000 --> 01:36:03.480]  enter this team as well as far as what happens after that I'm not sure but we
[01:36:03.480 --> 01:36:08.040]  do have instructions to call the health department and I'm sure they would be in
[01:36:08.040 --> 01:36:14.320]  contact with the CDC then what about the ethical issues of vans pulling up and
[01:36:14.320 --> 01:36:18.280]  disappearing people they should just be honest and they should be quarantined in
[01:36:18.280 --> 01:36:22.000]  military facilities that are designed for this that's why we paid for them and
[01:36:22.000 --> 01:36:26.800]  built them why cover up that the disappearances are going on we've now
[01:36:26.800 --> 01:36:31.560]  confirmed this in triplicate with doctors and Border Patrol people by name
[01:36:31.560 --> 01:36:36.320]  this is now confirmed because my concern is it sets up the infrastructure to
[01:36:36.320 --> 01:36:40.200]  expand this to political people and other things if you can get government to
[01:36:40.200 --> 01:36:44.000]  cover up disappearing medical people for medical issues then you can do
[01:36:44.000 --> 01:36:50.280]  anything in my view sure yeah I yeah I agree and as far as equipment equipping
[01:36:50.280 --> 01:36:54.160]  us the police department we have no equipment but the fire department has
[01:36:54.160 --> 01:37:01.640]  no specific equipment that would be effective against Ebola well it's
[01:37:01.640 --> 01:37:05.080]  getting out of hand and there's clearly a cover up I just pray it's it's not as
[01:37:05.080 --> 01:37:16.560]  bad as it looks so what does your gut tell you is going on well I the chance
[01:37:16.560 --> 01:37:22.640]  to interact with illegal immigrants all the time I work in a small village and
[01:37:22.640 --> 01:37:28.040]  I still encounter them all the time and I think with the borders being open as
[01:37:28.040 --> 01:37:33.040]  they are this is they don't want it to get out that it is probably is more
[01:37:33.040 --> 01:37:36.480]  widespread than it is because it can be tied to illegal immigration just like
[01:37:36.480 --> 01:37:41.840]  the virus that the school kids are getting and it's tied to Latin American
[01:37:41.840 --> 01:37:45.960]  countries as well yep that's it total political correctness and then they get
[01:37:45.960 --> 01:37:49.560]  to implode the country and make billions off the vaccines thank you so much sir
[01:37:49.560 --> 01:37:53.320]  thank you for the information okay we're gonna go to our guest here for 30
[01:37:53.320 --> 01:37:56.600]  minutes in the next hour then I will continue with your calls and we have a

[01:38:07.440 --> 01:38:12.300]  what I'm personally doing to boost my immune system is survival shield x2
[01:38:12.300 --> 01:38:16.360]  nascent iodine that I believe from the research we've done is just as important
[01:38:16.360 --> 01:38:20.000]  as colloidal silver and other things also super mill vitality superfumil
[01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:26.480]  vitality lung cleanse 70% of the immune system is in the gut the oxypowder DNA
[01:38:26.480 --> 01:38:31.320]  force does stuff above and beyond vitamin C and with the bio PQQ and the
[01:38:31.320 --> 01:38:35.880]  coq 10 organic sources of that it is a nutraceutical of the highest quality
[01:38:35.880 --> 01:38:41.040]  it's all available at info wars life dot com and I've been saying for six months
[01:38:41.040 --> 01:38:43.640]  boost your immune system going into this winter because I lost three family

[01:38:52.920 --> 01:38:56.240]  unbelievable what the Mercer and stuff's doing so bottom line I would try to
[01:38:56.240 --> 01:39:01.720]  abuse as much as you can boost your immune system boost your your body's

[01:39:35.920 --> 01:39:41.520]  has got important info on the economy what would Ebola affect the economy like
[01:39:41.520 --> 01:39:48.440]  as well and we're joined by Harry Dent author of the demographic cliff an
[01:39:48.440 --> 01:39:52.600]  editor of the free newsletter economy and markets he's the founder event
[01:39:52.600 --> 01:39:57.520]  research and was formerly a top analyst at Bain capital and ran a lot of major
[01:39:57.520 --> 01:40:01.840]  operations there he's had a bunch of best-selling books his first a big best
[01:40:01.840 --> 01:40:05.720]  seller was the great boom ahead published in 92 which folks thought was
[01:40:05.720 --> 01:40:10.880]  crazy he accurately forecasted the unanticipated boom of the 90s and the
[01:40:10.880 --> 01:40:16.480]  continued expansion in 2007 then he predicted 2008 collapse and Harry Dent
[01:40:16.480 --> 01:40:21.120]  dot com is his website if you go to Harry Dent dot com forward slash Alex Jones
[01:40:21.120 --> 01:40:25.400]  he did something nice publishing some of his book that's been unpublished online
[01:40:25.400 --> 01:40:29.920]  just for our listeners Harry Dent dot com forward slash Alex Jones he always
[01:40:29.920 --> 01:40:34.640]  sends us great graphs and documents to put on screen for TV viewers so I'd
[01:40:34.640 --> 01:40:38.040]  encourage radio listeners to go to info wars dot com forward slash show to
[01:40:38.040 --> 01:40:42.320]  actually watch the feed or later you can always go to prison planet TV as a
[01:40:42.320 --> 01:40:46.880]  subscriber and see the TV version simulcast of this transmission sorry
[01:40:46.880 --> 01:40:51.280]  to get you on later today we have medical doctors confirming to us that
[01:40:51.280 --> 01:40:55.520]  they're covering up what they believe to be Ebola and whisking him away how would
[01:40:55.520 --> 01:41:00.520]  in your view as an economist and an analyst how would this affect things if
[01:41:00.520 --> 01:41:04.880]  they do cover up Ebola and there's even a moderate epidemic a few thousand
[01:41:04.880 --> 01:41:09.500]  people that get it I mean looks to me like that would cause some major shock
[01:41:09.500 --> 01:41:14.480]  waves in the economy well you know that this recent mini crash 10 percent down
[01:41:14.480 --> 01:41:21.320]  in the markets was a combination of the Ebola news and Germany's economic
[01:41:21.320 --> 01:41:26.480]  minister standing up the Mario Draghi and at the ECB in Europe and saying no
[01:41:26.480 --> 01:41:30.880]  more QE that's crazy so the markets are not gonna like this I think they care
[01:41:30.880 --> 01:41:37.040]  more about no more QE in Germany but if Ebola gets any significant size
[01:41:37.040 --> 01:41:41.360]  everybody knows this is exponential it happens and we've seen epidemics like
[01:41:41.360 --> 01:41:46.200]  this before there was a great one in the early 20s during a downturn so you know
[01:41:46.200 --> 01:41:50.640]  at some point it could have a big impact and particularly if it's not known or
[01:41:50.640 --> 01:41:54.960]  covered up and then suddenly it's found out so I mean I'm definitely not an
[01:41:54.960 --> 01:41:58.520]  expert on that but we do see it we actually we just had a conference in
[01:41:58.520 --> 01:42:05.080]  Miami and had a speaker from the Elliott Wave organization that said their
[01:42:05.080 --> 01:42:09.600]  their studies show that when stock markets peak and go down as we're seeing
[01:42:09.600 --> 01:42:16.080]  like in the early 30s or the mid 70s or now you usually do get things like
[01:42:16.080 --> 01:42:19.920]  epidemics and you get things you know weird weather like the dust bowl of the
[01:42:19.920 --> 01:42:24.600]  1930s so these things tend to happen together in cycles that's why you said
[01:42:24.600 --> 01:42:27.880]  this six months ago you said epidemics in weird weather and people like well how
[01:42:27.880 --> 01:42:32.960]  is that explain it's sun it's sun cycles well that that's part of it too about
[01:42:32.960 --> 01:42:39.600]  every ten years our solar radiation peaks and then goes down for five to six
[01:42:39.600 --> 01:42:44.000]  years and in those down cycles you're more likely to see it any any type of
[01:42:44.000 --> 01:42:50.800]  thing from from worsening weather less rainfall less sunshine possibly
[01:42:50.800 --> 01:42:58.240]  epidemics and all 88 I went back 190 years 88% of substantial financial
[01:42:58.240 --> 01:43:04.320]  crises crashes occur and major recessions occurred in this down solar
[01:43:04.320 --> 01:43:10.800]  spot cycle so this is a very tangible cycle that does have a tangible effect
[01:43:10.800 --> 01:43:16.400]  on the economy we've just seen the most extended sunspot cycle in history at
[01:43:16.400 --> 01:43:23.800]  least back to the 1700s the last one and now this cycle points down from 2014 in
[01:43:23.800 --> 01:43:29.360]  July 2019 early 2020 so this is saying we're gonna have a financial crisis or
[01:43:29.360 --> 01:43:33.080]  we're gonna have anything major go wrong in the world it's gonna happen in the
[01:43:33.080 --> 01:43:39.200]  next five years you've got a article up on your site right now Harry Dent com
[01:43:39.200 --> 01:43:44.080]  Ford slash Alex Jones says Dow 6000 are you prepared again you were on with us
[01:43:44.080 --> 01:43:48.520]  about six months ago and predicted the stock market would start going down it
[01:43:48.520 --> 01:43:53.680]  has done that what is your latest analysis well you know we're in and we're in a
[01:43:53.680 --> 01:43:57.680]  I think a topping process here that can go either way we've been saying and you
[01:43:57.680 --> 01:44:03.080]  probably have this chart megaphone pattern every bull market and bubble we've
[01:44:03.080 --> 01:44:06.640]  had we've had bubble after bubble at stocks and commodities and everything
[01:44:06.640 --> 01:44:11.440]  even real estate but you know the first peak was 2000 the tech bubble and then a
[01:44:11.440 --> 01:44:16.800]  big crash and then a higher high in 2007 and then a bigger crash and now we've
[01:44:16.800 --> 01:44:21.080]  got an even higher high and that's the megaphone pattern each bubble takes us
[01:44:21.080 --> 01:44:25.520]  the new highs but each crash afterwards takes us to even lower lows so we've
[01:44:25.520 --> 01:44:30.080]  been predicting for the last year that the value would peak around 17,200 to
[01:44:30.080 --> 01:44:36.960]  300 it actually hit 17,350 in September and then the next crash over a
[01:44:36.960 --> 01:44:42.120]  couple of years would take us probably around late 2016 give or take to around
[01:44:42.120 --> 01:44:47.440]  5,800 to 6,000 on the doubt that's a 65% crash and that wouldn't be the bottom
[01:44:47.440 --> 01:44:53.000]  but that would be similar to the worst crash we saw in the 1970s extended
[01:44:53.000 --> 01:44:57.680]  bear market when the last generation peaked and spending in 73 and 74 so
[01:44:57.680 --> 01:45:02.000]  we're looking for a big crash my only question is we told people look sell at
[01:45:02.000 --> 01:45:07.160]  17,000 to 300 but the upside on this megaphone pattern is very very limited
[01:45:07.160 --> 01:45:12.040]  and the downside is very strong and you never know what's going to be bad news
[01:45:12.040 --> 01:45:16.920]  about Ebola or or Germany or China bubble bursting all things we've been
[01:45:16.920 --> 01:45:20.800]  predicting would happen and there's many other things so so the downside's much
[01:45:20.800 --> 01:45:25.480]  stronger now what we had is two things we had a key trend that would say look
[01:45:25.480 --> 01:45:32.160]  if we peaked over 17,000 and now and then broke below 16,500 that's a sign
[01:45:32.160 --> 01:45:36.120]  that the momentum's over well we did that but then the market turned around
[01:45:36.120 --> 01:45:40.840]  with the bulls jumping back in and now it's gone back up and we had what's
[01:45:40.840 --> 01:45:47.160]  called a confirmation rally just a couple days ago that said you know there's a
[01:45:47.160 --> 01:45:52.320]  chance we may make a slight new high so I'd say it's about 50-50 that we made a
[01:45:52.320 --> 01:45:57.680]  top in September or 50% chance that we'll see a top but only slightly higher I
[01:45:57.680 --> 01:46:02.960]  would estimate Dow 17,500 at the highest so there's not much upside and there's
[01:46:02.960 --> 01:46:07.560]  a whole lot of downside this megaphone pattern was the same thing that happened
[01:46:07.560 --> 01:46:13.040]  when the last generation peaked I between 1965 and 68 and then stimulus
[01:46:13.040 --> 01:46:18.640]  to follow you saw a peak in 65 or crash a peak in 68 higher a bigger crash and
[01:46:18.640 --> 01:46:23.560]  then up then the biggest crash came after the peak in late 72 into late 74
[01:46:23.560 --> 01:46:28.040]  crash so this megaphone pattern very powerful economists are ignoring it
[01:46:28.040 --> 01:46:31.600]  because they dare in denial about the bubble all they do to say there is no
[01:46:31.600 --> 01:46:35.080]  bubble because of this there is no bubble Janet Yellen says there's no bubble
[01:46:35.080 --> 01:46:40.240]  Mario Draga but then meanwhile people like Donald Trump and John Williams of
[01:46:40.240 --> 01:46:44.680]  shadow stats and so many others are joining you saying get out this is
[01:46:44.680 --> 01:46:47.840]  gonna be really big but but let's look at the megaphone chart for TV viewers
[01:46:47.840 --> 01:46:52.720]  I'll describe it for radio listeners and it shows history up until now the chart
[01:46:52.720 --> 01:46:58.840]  that's just computer generated basically shows by 2015 the big drop begins and
[01:46:58.840 --> 01:47:03.720]  then it spikes back up in 2016 for a little bit but but still overall down
[01:47:03.720 --> 01:47:08.440]  from the high and then it really goes down in 2017 back up a little bit in the
[01:47:08.440 --> 01:47:14.760]  2019 and then are you saying it bottoms out by 2023 yeah actually I think on
[01:47:14.760 --> 01:47:20.800]  early 2020 my my best estimate the reason Alex is we got demographic cycles
[01:47:20.800 --> 01:47:24.440]  that were known for just a 46 year lag on the birth index for the peak and
[01:47:24.440 --> 01:47:29.400]  spending that person a scientifically documentable fact in a projectable trend
[01:47:29.400 --> 01:47:32.560]  and the elites know that they look at populations and trends and where they're
[01:47:32.560 --> 01:47:38.880]  gonna invest next so let me ask you this then in the past though they didn't
[01:47:38.880 --> 01:47:43.640]  have this much market rigging this much flash trading they didn't have this high
[01:47:43.640 --> 01:47:48.280]  tech of derivatives they just had old-fashioned counterfeiting and you
[01:47:48.280 --> 01:47:51.360]  know they had old-fashioned fractional reserve banking with all the new
[01:47:51.360 --> 01:47:55.680]  manipulations they've got an automation and new technologies and more
[01:47:55.680 --> 01:48:02.320]  scientific mumbo jumbo in the systems is there a way that they can flim flam
[01:48:02.320 --> 01:48:07.520]  out of this and break the 6,000-year-old trends well you know that they
[01:48:07.520 --> 01:48:12.320]  already have Alex this this boom on technologies the internet peaking back
[01:48:12.320 --> 01:48:17.280]  in the like 2007-8 demographic trends as we predicted 20 years ago the baby
[01:48:17.280 --> 01:48:22.520]  boom with peak and by late 2007 and they did housing with decline on they did
[01:48:22.520 --> 01:48:25.920]  autos are going to decline start to climb next year they come late on the
[01:48:25.920 --> 01:48:30.120]  cycle we predicted all this stuff but the government has kept the economy going
[01:48:30.120 --> 01:48:34.840]  not as not as good as before but kept it going and the stock market's gone to
[01:48:34.840 --> 01:48:38.120]  new highs because they're throwing trillions of dollars in the economy and
[01:48:38.120 --> 01:48:41.720]  it's not being lent because everybody over borrowed this is its consumers
[01:48:41.720 --> 01:48:46.480]  already over in debt over in capacity too big a home so the money's just going
[01:48:46.480 --> 01:48:50.600]  into speculation and it's driving the markets up and companies are buying back
[01:48:50.600 --> 01:48:54.040]  their stock and doing all this artificial stuff that you can only do when
[01:48:54.040 --> 01:48:59.440]  interest rates are zero short-term and when adjusted for inflation about 2%
[01:48:59.440 --> 01:49:04.140]  on average zero long-term you set interest rates at zero you're going to get
[01:49:04.140 --> 01:49:09.400]  massive exactly so what do you expect to happen with the QE will they dial it
[01:49:09.400 --> 01:49:13.720]  back or shut it off completely and why is Germany the only major group we see
[01:49:13.720 --> 01:49:18.120]  complaining about QE unlimited well Germany's the only country that's gone
[01:49:18.120 --> 01:49:23.200]  through a hyperinflation in the last century and so they know the ravages of
[01:49:23.200 --> 01:49:26.760]  inflation and they're the only ones objecting everybody else is just like
[01:49:26.760 --> 01:49:30.720]  we'll cover it over give us a free lunch I mean that's what everybody's doing I
[01:49:30.720 --> 01:49:35.720]  think you know the Fed I've been saying for the last year the Fed is tapering
[01:49:35.720 --> 01:49:40.640]  and now they're going back to zero supposedly this month they're tapering
[01:49:40.640 --> 01:49:44.640]  right at the wrong time I don't like QE in the first place it's artificial it
[01:49:44.640 --> 01:49:47.680]  distorts the markets it kills free market capitalism and the whole
[01:49:47.680 --> 01:49:51.840]  innovation process that needs booms and busts and inflation and depletion all
[01:49:51.840 --> 01:49:57.320]  the things they try to prevent but they're tapering just as the second wave
[01:49:57.320 --> 01:50:02.400]  of demographic decline hits the United States Homer Simpson peaked in 2007 at
[01:50:02.400 --> 01:50:08.520]  age 46 the wealthiest people the top 20% in our society they're still highly
[01:50:08.520 --> 01:50:12.400]  employed college educated benefiting from this bubble because they own most of
[01:50:12.400 --> 01:50:17.400]  financial asset they're due to peak late this year right about now and fall off
[01:50:17.400 --> 01:50:21.440]  the spending clip just like Homer Simpson did the Fed doesn't understand
[01:50:21.440 --> 01:50:25.960]  demographics they just think well the economy doing better and so we can now
[01:50:25.960 --> 01:50:29.520]  taper off and not look like a bunch of idiots and act like we got to stimulate
[01:50:29.520 --> 01:50:33.320]  the economy forever because that's a sign that it's weak to have to stimulate it
[01:50:33.320 --> 01:50:37.920]  for six years just to get 2% growth on average when our normal growth rates are
[01:50:37.920 --> 01:50:42.800]  three to four percent it shows how weak the economy is to have this lower
[01:50:42.800 --> 01:50:47.240]  inflation with this much money printing shows how strong deflationary trend
[01:50:47.240 --> 01:50:51.800]  I agree and we've been seeing that we've been seeing that happen now some deflationary evidence
[01:50:51.800 --> 01:50:54.480]  I want to get into that when we come back with Harry Dent Harry Dent dot com

[01:54:14.200 --> 01:54:21.800]  here's what we know if you leave me we live in a very rigged economy there were
[01:54:21.800 --> 01:54:25.600]  a mainstream news articles on Monday I saw admitting that the NSA is being used
[01:54:25.600 --> 01:54:30.640]  to give key intel to select global corporations a lot of not even us to
[01:54:30.640 --> 01:54:35.960]  corner markets we don't want to live in this rigged system or we pay for this
[01:54:35.960 --> 01:54:40.400]  big panopticon expiry and then a bunch of inside interest basically fix the
[01:54:40.400 --> 01:54:45.200]  economy there's always been fixes and problems and that's what turns you into
[01:54:45.200 --> 01:54:50.360]  third-world nation now they're scapegoating the free market for this
[01:54:50.360 --> 01:54:54.520]  crony system they built where they bought the public for some chicken feed
[01:54:54.520 --> 01:54:58.520]  welfare and then you know all this corporate welfare and then they're
[01:54:58.520 --> 01:55:02.080]  always out trying to extinguish any real free market corporations or
[01:55:02.080 --> 01:55:06.840]  companies or individuals as if the very idea of free market threatens their
[01:55:06.840 --> 01:55:11.320]  rule and hegemony they want to kill the golden goose that's my view on it
[01:55:11.320 --> 01:55:16.840]  Harry Dent best-selling author researcher former top analyst and well you
[01:55:16.840 --> 01:55:21.120]  guys have a lot of their operations with Bain Capital joins us about 15-20
[01:55:21.120 --> 01:55:24.720]  minutes the next hour then I'm going to go to medical doctors and others calling
[01:55:24.720 --> 01:55:27.960]  in with their take on Ebola and the bombshell news we broke in the last hour
[01:55:27.960 --> 01:55:32.040]  that there are people that clearly have Ebola in hospitals and the feds are
[01:55:32.040 --> 01:55:35.920]  whisking them away this is this is just wild and I've talked personally not just
[01:55:35.920 --> 01:55:39.640]  to this medical doctor on record on air but another one I know in a major city
[01:55:39.640 --> 01:55:45.880]  in Texas that said it is going on and it's very freaked out Mr. Dent getting
[01:55:45.880 --> 01:55:49.360]  back into what we're seeing on a depressionary level with all this
[01:55:49.360 --> 01:55:54.520]  inflationary garbage paper on top of it why there's that paradox and then your
[01:55:54.520 --> 01:56:00.640]  take on my view that they're scapegoating capitalism for the rack and ruin that the
[01:56:00.640 --> 01:56:05.480]  departure from capitalism is causing. Well you know Alex free market
[01:56:05.480 --> 01:56:10.200]  capitalism always goes to extremes and but it rebalances itself just like the
[01:56:10.200 --> 01:56:14.160]  body the body gets out of balance it knows how to rebalance itself especially
[01:56:14.160 --> 01:56:18.320]  to eat the right foods and feed it right and stuff the government started this
[01:56:18.320 --> 01:56:21.960]  it started with Greenspan after the 87 crash he said oh my gosh we can't have
[01:56:21.960 --> 01:56:25.760]  a crash like this so he pushes interest rates down and then you know the SNL
[01:56:25.760 --> 01:56:30.000]  crisis again and then long-term capital management a big hedge fund fail they've
[01:56:30.000 --> 01:56:34.080]  been they've been pushing down interest rates short-term and long-term
[01:56:34.080 --> 01:56:37.880]  manipulating the economy they don't trust the free market capitalist system and if
[01:56:37.880 --> 01:56:42.440]  you don't let it work you don't get the innovation the innovation comes from the
[01:56:42.440 --> 01:56:46.780]  extremes of boom and bust inflation and depletion we need those dynamic
[01:56:46.780 --> 01:56:50.880]  opposites they're trying to turn this darn thing into a machine it's not a
[01:56:50.880 --> 01:56:55.480]  machine it's our organic process just like our body so they are killing the
[01:56:55.480 --> 01:56:59.080]  golden goose we just had David Stockman at our major conference he said the same
[01:56:59.080 --> 01:57:03.680]  thing he called it the corruption of capitalism in America so that's what
[01:57:03.680 --> 01:57:07.120]  they're doing and they're blaming the free markets when things goes wrong they've
[01:57:07.120 --> 01:57:13.080]  been rigging this since 1987 with the president's committee on open markets
[01:57:13.080 --> 01:57:17.560]  the plunge protection team and many other systems this is a rigged game my
[01:57:17.560 --> 01:57:22.000]  issue with it being rigged is not that it just kills innovation it allows select
[01:57:22.000 --> 01:57:26.440]  groups to capitalize on it at the expense of other real entrepreneurs and
[01:57:26.440 --> 01:57:31.760]  risk takers no that's right there's no question about it and by the Fed
[01:57:31.760 --> 01:57:36.040]  keeping this bubble going even when it burst in 2008 all they're doing is
[01:57:36.040 --> 01:57:40.480]  favoring all those special interests on Wall Street I mean I want to see some
[01:57:40.480 --> 01:57:44.960]  major financial institutions and investment funds go down because they
[01:57:44.960 --> 01:57:49.280]  deserve to I want to see banks go down they made horrible loans in the free
[01:57:49.280 --> 01:57:54.480]  market system the way we learn and grow is with there's consequences when you
[01:57:54.480 --> 01:57:57.680]  do something wrong that's how you learn and people don't realize even in human
[01:57:57.680 --> 01:58:02.200]  life not just in our economy we learn and grow and evolve the most when we
[01:58:02.200 --> 01:58:06.160]  learn from our mistakes not just when we're unsuccessful we learned during
[01:58:06.160 --> 01:58:11.720]  crises exactly the greatest innovations the greatest leaders have always and I
[01:58:11.720 --> 01:58:16.960]  mean always come through crisis like the 1930s and World War two or like the
[01:58:16.960 --> 01:58:22.720]  1970s inflation era Harry Dan is our guest right now Harry that

[02:01:51.280 --> 02:01:56.280]  down centrally planned more than any economy ever in history they have moved
[02:01:56.280 --> 02:02:01.240]  15 percent of the population 220 million people in the last 15 years the
[02:02:01.240 --> 02:02:05.800]  biggest push of migration urban migration and all of history hey it's
[02:02:05.800 --> 02:02:10.760]  natural to do that up to a certain point this is massive it's overdone they've
[02:02:10.760 --> 02:02:14.120]  moved these people to cities with no skills they haven't built more
[02:02:14.120 --> 02:02:19.160]  apartments and infrastructures and industrial plants for nobody China right
[02:02:19.160 --> 02:02:22.680]  now and it's not just me the top economists that study this we're saying
[02:02:22.680 --> 02:02:27.240]  the same thing a few of the few that are willing to admit it they have 30 to 50
[02:02:27.240 --> 02:02:31.640]  percent more industrial capacity need infrastructures bridges railways
[02:02:31.640 --> 02:02:36.320]  roads to nowhere that make any other place look like nothing 27% of their
[02:02:36.320 --> 02:02:41.320]  urban homes are vacant they have built enough infrastructure and housing and
[02:02:41.320 --> 02:02:45.520]  offices and all this stuff for the next 12 to 15 years even at the highest
[02:02:45.520 --> 02:02:50.200]  migration rates in history which no way is going to continue the China bubble is
[02:02:50.200 --> 02:02:55.040]  going to burst these 220 million unskilled people will are not even legal
[02:02:55.040 --> 02:02:59.160]  citizens in their own in the cities they're in only in their rural areas I
[02:02:59.160 --> 02:03:02.840]  think not only is this migration going to stop and this overbuilding is going to
[02:03:02.840 --> 02:03:07.000]  collapse on itself but a lot of these rural people rural people have to move
[02:03:07.000 --> 02:03:11.200]  back to rural areas if they're left and haven't paved over them already with
[02:03:11.200 --> 02:03:16.600]  empty condos but China is the largest most obvious bubble in all of modern
[02:03:16.600 --> 02:03:20.520]  history and everybody thinks China is just fine fine fine and loves the fact
[02:03:20.520 --> 02:03:23.800]  that their government drives their economy and thinks the government won't
[02:03:23.800 --> 02:03:29.360]  let it fail I was in Dubai in 2006 and 2007 speaking at two major conferences
[02:03:29.360 --> 02:03:33.400]  just before that bubble burst I said this bubble is going to burst the greatest
[02:03:33.400 --> 02:03:36.840]  overbuilding in the world before China they said no the government won't let
[02:03:36.840 --> 02:03:41.400]  it and I said oh you're really in trouble 2008 it burst China is going to burst
[02:03:41.400 --> 02:03:45.520]  it's already starting to burst it will be it will reverberate around the world
[02:03:45.520 --> 02:03:51.000]  more than the subprime crisis and the banking crisis in the US back in 2008
[02:03:51.000 --> 02:03:55.800]  this is you got to get this chapter I go to an in-depth this is the biggest
[02:03:55.800 --> 02:03:58.800]  thing's going to happen the other thing Alex just to bring it up while I'm at it
[02:03:58.800 --> 02:04:03.920]  Germany in the late 80s 88 89 I said Japan's going to fall off a cliff and
[02:04:03.920 --> 02:04:07.880]  collapse in the 90s while the US and Europe have the strongest demographic
[02:04:07.880 --> 02:04:12.520]  baby boom spending trend in history that's exactly what happened Germany has
[02:04:12.520 --> 02:04:19.120]  a worse demographic slowdown from 2014 to 2022 than Japan had in the 90s and
[02:04:19.120 --> 02:04:23.600]  and worse than any country in Europe and many follow it Germany is going to lead
[02:04:23.600 --> 02:04:27.800]  Europe down and like you like we mentioned earlier Germany is the only
[02:04:27.800 --> 02:04:32.200]  country smart enough to say that endless money printing is not the way to deal
[02:04:32.200 --> 02:04:37.000]  with this crisis debt restructuring the reality is they're smart enough on that
[02:04:37.000 --> 02:04:40.320]  but guess what they're supposed to hold Europe together they're going to keep
[02:04:40.320 --> 02:04:44.680]  falling apart you think they're hesitant to eat or hesitant to bail out southern
[02:04:44.680 --> 02:04:48.840]  European countries now wait until their economy keeps failing in the last two
[02:04:48.840 --> 02:04:53.600]  quarters Germany done nothing but just a point that's right final segment with

[02:10:07.840 --> 02:10:11.120]  yeah I'm sure that's what's really going on that's some of the news up on
[02:10:11.120 --> 02:10:17.040]  info wars.com and prisonplanet.com Democrats are racing away from Obama
[02:10:17.040 --> 02:10:20.800]  right now and he's being booed and folks are walking off at the few fundraisers
[02:10:20.800 --> 02:10:25.440]  he comes to the New York Times said yesterday of course that they are quote
[02:10:25.440 --> 02:10:31.200]  in a emergency situation have hit the panic button and saying the president's
[02:10:31.200 --> 02:10:36.480]  not relevant he's gone in two years they're now race baiting heavily drugs
[02:10:36.480 --> 02:10:41.960]  report.com has articles and video of that unfolding from the daily caller
[02:10:41.960 --> 02:10:48.640]  going back to Harry Dent economist researcher best-selling author HarryDent.com
[02:10:48.640 --> 02:10:54.080]  Ford slash Alex Jones you can get his new book there on the site that the
[02:10:54.080 --> 02:10:59.160]  demographic cliff that I absolutely agree with in the time we've got left what
[02:10:59.160 --> 02:11:03.880]  is your prognosis on Germany finishing up what do you make of what's happening
[02:11:03.880 --> 02:11:08.480]  in the Ukraine short-term long-term and then shifting back to the elections and
[02:11:08.480 --> 02:11:14.520]  what's happening here what your view on Obama and what he might pull you as a
[02:11:14.520 --> 02:11:20.760]  wild card in the economy. Well you know the first thing with Russian Ukraine we
[02:11:20.760 --> 02:11:25.520]  have a geopolitical cycle that I developed in late 2005 and early 2006 to
[02:11:25.520 --> 02:11:29.880]  add to my demographic cycles I realized that has a huge impact on stock
[02:11:29.880 --> 02:11:36.280]  valuations and this shifts about every 18 years 1983 to 2000 nothing went wrong
[02:11:36.280 --> 02:11:41.480]  in the world we had one quick war with Saddam Hussein we tacked him back out no
[02:11:41.480 --> 02:11:46.720]  big deal 2001 Ford we know what happened 9-11 and then you know the
[02:11:46.720 --> 02:11:51.360]  Iraqi war that was serious occupation Afghan war that they really failed
[02:11:51.360 --> 02:11:57.160]  Middle East one Arab spring and revolt after the next you know Israel and
[02:11:57.160 --> 02:12:03.720]  Hamas and the Gaza Strip and now we have something more serious Russia moving
[02:12:03.720 --> 02:12:07.160]  into Ukraine obviously they want to restore the Soviet Union they are one
[02:12:07.160 --> 02:12:11.240]  of the worst demographic countries ahead a declining power but they're still
[02:12:11.240 --> 02:12:15.840]  have the only real offensive force in the world outside the United States so
[02:12:15.840 --> 02:12:22.160]  this is a mini World War 3 possible this geopolitical cycle points down from 2001
[02:12:22.160 --> 02:12:28.680]  into at least late 2019 early 2020 which means we got five more years of this
[02:12:28.680 --> 02:12:36.360]  getting worse so by the way I mean just to back up what you're saying look at
[02:12:36.360 --> 02:12:40.920]  the Ministry of Defense report from 2007 the London Guardian reported on
[02:12:40.920 --> 02:12:45.480]  revolution flash mobs and brain ships a grim vision of the future and then you
[02:12:45.480 --> 02:12:50.080]  can actually read the report from the Ministry of Defense future strategic
[02:12:50.080 --> 02:12:58.360]  context planning they predict basically 2015 2016 through 2022 or so global
[02:12:58.360 --> 02:13:04.400]  meltdown just absolute insane terrorism wars you name it the Pentagon then
[02:13:04.400 --> 02:13:07.960]  declassified last year report from the same year saying what you're saying
[02:13:07.960 --> 02:13:10.520]  saying when I'm saying it's not like we're being pessimists we're saying
[02:13:10.520 --> 02:13:14.240]  folks need to be ready for this in these cycles but the elites know this
[02:13:14.240 --> 02:13:19.360]  George Soros knows this the the CIA people I know Pentagon people high level
[02:13:19.360 --> 02:13:24.200]  all know this billionaires I know know this all the real analysts know this so
[02:13:24.200 --> 02:13:27.680]  you've got separate real analysts like you who are out there talking to real
[02:13:27.680 --> 02:13:31.680]  investors institutional investors retail investors that are smart enough to
[02:13:31.680 --> 02:13:36.560]  research then you've got the CNBC crowd that's kind of got its own brand of
[02:13:36.560 --> 02:13:40.160]  hype with Jim Kramer up there but even some truth comes out on those shows now
[02:13:40.160 --> 02:13:46.040]  about how we have a crony centralized system I mean how can you be so accurate
[02:13:46.040 --> 02:13:49.640]  and we know what's going on the Pentagon knows what's going on but we're not
[02:13:49.640 --> 02:13:54.800]  really hearing this message a lot of other places it's just crazy what do you
[02:13:54.800 --> 02:13:59.160]  expect to come out of this well again it's only going to get worse at a time
[02:13:59.160 --> 02:14:03.000]  when demographic trends get worse innovation slowing down after everybody's
[02:14:03.000 --> 02:14:06.440]  been on the internet and this Sunspot cycle point out all four of our cycles
[02:14:06.440 --> 02:14:11.960]  are down at the same time from late 2014 and early 2020 that's only happened
[02:14:11.960 --> 02:14:17.240]  twice the mid 70s and early 30s the worst two economic crises in the last
[02:14:17.240 --> 02:14:22.880]  century so it's only gonna get worse and so and these cycles are very solid
[02:14:22.880 --> 02:14:28.520]  again since 2001 geopolitics trends have just gotten worse the stock market is
[02:14:28.520 --> 02:14:32.160]  acting like there's nothing wrong in the world and that's why people say oh the
[02:14:32.160 --> 02:14:36.520]  market's not overvalued it's way overvalued demographic trends and
[02:14:36.520 --> 02:14:39.920]  geopolitical so the stock market is going to have to get in reality for one
[02:14:39.920 --> 02:14:42.840]  thing but you're going to have to look at your life and your business and say
[02:14:42.840 --> 02:14:46.680]  it's not just a stock market economy going down the world's going to get much
[02:14:46.680 --> 02:14:51.960]  more uncertain and more dangerous well my gut tells me China's unprecedented
[02:14:51.960 --> 02:14:57.120]  manipulation US manipulation EU manipulation all this manipulation will
[02:14:57.120 --> 02:15:01.120]  only make it worse when these bubbles finally implode and they can't pump them
[02:15:01.120 --> 02:15:06.400]  up again any more of the book the demographic cliff is available in book
[02:15:06.400 --> 02:15:11.720]  stores everywhere or at harriedent.com forward slash Alex Jones you can find
[02:15:11.720 --> 02:15:14.840]  right there a free chapter that you didn't end up getting in the book on the
[02:15:14.840 --> 02:15:19.440]  China disaster ahead thank you so much for the time sir thank you our always
[02:15:19.440 --> 02:15:23.280]  interesting and I tell you I'm not being pessimistic people say oh don't be
[02:15:23.280 --> 02:15:27.600]  pessimistic you gotta live in the real world I mean very positive here like the
[02:15:27.600 --> 02:15:32.040]  police know that murders and robberies and rapes more than double on a full moon
[02:15:32.040 --> 02:15:35.880]  you can give whatever reason you think that is they know that in major cities
[02:15:35.880 --> 02:15:42.040]  it's also bad in the countryside it's cycles we run off cycles and it's not
[02:15:42.040 --> 02:15:46.520]  mumbo jumbo it's it's the moon it's the sun it's the it's the I mean the sun
[02:15:46.520 --> 02:15:50.200]  causes all the life on earth and it goes into these cycles historically and
[02:15:50.200 --> 02:15:54.760]  then you add the demographic cliffs that that run congruent with it and you add
[02:15:54.760 --> 02:15:59.360]  the military and the in the in the oil and the energy and the in the carrying
[02:15:59.360 --> 02:16:03.120]  capacity it is crazy now I really appreciate Phil who says he's a
[02:16:03.120 --> 02:16:07.160]  physician holding will go to Ben and Jeff as well I cut dinner off early so
[02:16:07.160 --> 02:16:15.240]  I could get to you guys again I put the call out 800-259-9231 800-259-9231
[02:16:15.240 --> 02:16:18.720]  are you military are you police are your firefighters are your medical doctors
[02:16:18.720 --> 02:16:24.360]  are you medical workers are you RNs are you nurse practitioners what do you say
[02:16:24.360 --> 02:16:29.200]  about Dr. James Lorenzi who was on who confirm what my other medical doctors I
[02:16:29.200 --> 02:16:32.280]  know are saying that people come in with what's clearly a bowl of bleeding out
[02:16:32.280 --> 02:16:35.400]  they're told to say it's malaria that has not really know the same symptoms and
[02:16:35.400 --> 02:16:38.640]  then the feds sneak them off like something out of a science fiction
[02:16:38.640 --> 02:16:43.440]  dystopic movie what do you have to say about that bombshell interview we'll
[02:16:43.440 --> 02:16:49.000]  have the articles up soon info wars.com as all of this breaks here today but
[02:16:49.000 --> 02:16:55.520]  Phil in Florida who says you're a physician tell us your take on this
[02:16:55.520 --> 02:17:02.520]  yes Alex I am a physician I'm a family medicine doctor here in Daytona Beach I
[02:17:02.520 --> 02:17:07.720]  just wanted to add something to what Dr. Lorenzi said that even though the feds
[02:17:07.720 --> 02:17:11.440]  might be coming in and breaking down before I went to medical school I was a
[02:17:11.440 --> 02:17:16.760]  lab tech and I don't you know there's a way to prove whether it's malaria or
[02:17:16.760 --> 02:17:22.040]  not and what you want to do is if you're the lab tech and it never really
[02:17:22.040 --> 02:17:27.800]  bothered me as a lab tech to make a slide and maybe just put it under there
[02:17:27.800 --> 02:17:31.400]  because you have to demonstrate the parasite in the peripheral blood smear
[02:17:31.400 --> 02:17:38.520]  and if it's not malaria then the parasites not going to be there that's
[02:17:38.520 --> 02:17:43.640]  right but I mean I'm no rocket scientist but I mean Ebola and malaria
[02:17:43.640 --> 02:17:48.840]  malaria doesn't make you bleed out all your holes does it only it's the veer
[02:17:48.840 --> 02:17:52.680]  severe cases and it's nowhere near as severe as what we've been seeing with
[02:17:52.680 --> 02:17:58.800]  the like what's been seen with Ebola now or in the past so there's like you said
[02:17:58.800 --> 02:18:05.840]  earlier there's a raging fever you know you might urinate blood occasionally
[02:18:05.840 --> 02:18:10.280]  rarely people bleed in the intestinal tract but the one way to make that
[02:18:10.280 --> 02:18:16.760]  diagnosis is to grab that slide and I don't know there's when I worked after
[02:18:16.760 --> 02:18:19.960]  your shift or midnight just like I said there wasn't anybody there to stop me
[02:18:19.960 --> 02:18:24.280]  from maybe just making an extra slide and sticking it under there exactly
[02:18:24.280 --> 02:18:29.560]  there let me ask you this doc what do you make of them disappearing the people
[02:18:29.560 --> 02:18:33.360]  we have it from the border patrol ice and two medical doctors that I've talked
[02:18:33.360 --> 02:18:38.000]  to personally that this is going on so even if it isn't and I hope it's not
[02:18:38.000 --> 02:18:42.800]  Ebola why are they whisking him away and no record no that's I mean I'm in the
[02:18:42.800 --> 02:18:47.560]  same camp with you and Dr. Lorenzi on that it's either a false flag that
[02:18:47.560 --> 02:18:51.520]  they're planning they're gonna unleash these people at some point or they don't
[02:18:51.520 --> 02:18:56.800]  want to panic and mass hysteria and how severe the problem actually is but the
[02:18:56.800 --> 02:19:00.480]  way to stop a real panic is to be up front early on and shut it down right
[02:19:00.480 --> 02:19:06.720]  absolutely just isolate the people I mean you know the most ridiculous thing
[02:19:06.720 --> 02:19:11.760]  is just letting people flow through here without any isolation it's a joke the
[02:19:11.760 --> 02:19:16.800]  UN model says we will get more flights with Ebola they're predicting that we'll

[02:24:04.600 --> 02:24:10.800]  all right folks that was Jones here back live and I want to speak very slowly and
[02:24:10.800 --> 02:24:16.080]  very clearly because we were very clear on this in the first hour and we have
[02:24:16.080 --> 02:24:21.880]  articles coming out in the next 15 20 minutes at info wars.com and prison
[02:24:21.880 --> 02:24:31.800]  planet.com so this can all be very very clear James Lorenzi who is a doctor he
[02:24:31.800 --> 02:24:36.720]  works at Cass Regional Medical Center and surrounding medical centers that
[02:24:36.720 --> 02:24:43.040]  are affiliated with it they have not had what was suspected Ebola case we were
[02:24:43.040 --> 02:24:48.520]  very clear when he was on about that what happens is listeners don't listen
[02:24:48.520 --> 02:24:51.480]  because there's millions of them so some of them are gonna be out of any group
[02:24:51.480 --> 02:24:58.080]  not paying attention and so they start bombarding Cass Regional Medical Center
[02:24:58.080 --> 02:25:03.080]  asking them if they have Ebola they don't have any Ebola cases the only
[02:25:03.080 --> 02:25:07.560]  confirmed Ebola cases were in Dallas and then they let one nurse fly around a
[02:25:07.560 --> 02:25:13.280]  bunch of places and more aircraft are coming in with Ebola he did his medical
[02:25:13.280 --> 02:25:16.960]  internship when he was out of college before he became a full doctor at
[02:25:16.960 --> 02:25:21.680]  Truman Lakewood Medical Center and we're going through his interview getting
[02:25:21.680 --> 02:25:26.440]  all an article but that's where he got one of the calls from a doctor and
[02:25:26.440 --> 02:25:30.400]  nurses he knows saying people come in bleeding out the rear end you name it
[02:25:30.400 --> 02:25:34.480]  looks like Ebola the fed swoop in they disappear the people that's the issue
[02:25:34.480 --> 02:25:39.640]  could be malaria but the point is is the cover-up we have this from the border
[02:25:39.640 --> 02:25:43.680]  patrol so let's be clear Cass Regional Medical Center doesn't even have
[02:25:43.680 --> 02:25:49.320]  suspected cases they're fine let's be clear former top border patrol agent
[02:25:49.320 --> 02:25:52.880]  Zach Taylor who told us this weeks ago that they're scooping folks up on the
[02:25:52.880 --> 02:25:58.160]  border he doesn't have it I don't have it Anthony doesn't have it okay the story
[02:25:58.160 --> 02:26:02.040]  is and I'm not talking down to most the audience but those out there this is how
[02:26:02.040 --> 02:26:04.680]  Ebola creates a panic because the government's lying that destroys
[02:26:04.680 --> 02:26:07.880]  confidence we have a medical doctor on that confirms what a major medical
[02:26:07.880 --> 02:26:13.640]  doctor in Texas told us over a week ago that we know personally that this stuff
[02:26:13.640 --> 02:26:17.080]  is going on in Texas and they've been told shut up we've had firefighters on
[02:26:17.080 --> 02:26:21.920]  we've covered the news where the police and others are told don't say Ebola when
[02:26:21.920 --> 02:26:27.080]  you think it is so that's the story we got people dying vomiting on airplanes
[02:26:27.080 --> 02:26:36.200]  that doesn't mean that's Ebola 100% we're just reporting on so it's the Truman
[02:26:36.200 --> 02:26:41.160]  facility not affiliated with Cass Regional Medical Center Truman Lakewood
[02:26:41.160 --> 02:26:44.080]  Medical Center is where they thought this may have happened and we want to
[02:26:44.080 --> 02:26:48.480]  investigate the person being disappeared out of there okay and be very clear
[02:26:48.480 --> 02:26:50.920]  because this is the message I get that's why I said he had a lot of courage
[02:26:50.920 --> 02:26:54.200]  because they'll attack anybody for anything he could say that the capital
[02:26:54.200 --> 02:26:57.920]  was on fire and they'd probably crucify now he got a call from the head of the
[02:26:57.920 --> 02:27:01.880]  major company who was saying I like you you're nice you just better clarify well
[02:27:01.880 --> 02:27:06.800]  that CEO needs to know this he did what he was supposed to do he did put out the
[02:27:06.800 --> 02:27:10.880]  accurate info the fact that the public doesn't know which end is up sometimes
[02:27:10.880 --> 02:27:16.760]  it's just the way it is you cannot you know it's it's the fault of the
[02:27:16.760 --> 02:27:20.480]  government not responding to the Ebola and not having proper training that's
[02:27:20.480 --> 02:27:24.840]  causing this fear okay and the people have a right to know that's why no one
[02:27:24.840 --> 02:27:28.920]  will touch this and it's how the cover-up works because everyone is so scared to
[02:27:28.920 --> 02:27:32.160]  talk about what's going on of course if you've got a bunch of Ebola patients
[02:27:32.160 --> 02:27:36.000]  being brought in it's going to start spreading like it's done in Spain that's
[02:27:36.000 --> 02:27:39.000]  why they never did it before of course you bring in people from West Africa
[02:27:39.000 --> 02:27:43.080]  that's plagued with Ebola you're gonna get Ebola that's the issue not those of
[02:27:43.080 --> 02:27:47.400]  us reporting on it so again cast regional medical center great folks we were
[02:27:47.400 --> 02:27:52.680]  clear that's not where this was if it was there a suspected case and a cover-up
[02:27:52.680 --> 02:27:57.160]  we would say that we did not say that I'm gonna say one more time Truman Lakewood
[02:27:57.160 --> 02:28:01.720]  Medical Center Truman and that was not confirmed Ebola either people there were
[02:28:01.720 --> 02:28:05.880]  very suspicious and the people the person was then disappeared that's what
[02:28:05.880 --> 02:28:09.840]  needs to be investigated this is a free country we are what's left of the free
[02:28:09.840 --> 02:28:16.560]  press we will continue to report it here's the message urgent dr. Lorenzi is
[02:28:16.560 --> 02:28:19.960]  getting flat from his hospital CEO and he wants you to clarify that Ebola is not
[02:28:19.960 --> 02:28:24.480]  at his hospital cast regional medical center it is at other hospitals
[02:28:24.480 --> 02:28:32.280]  potentially potential Ebola in the area and it's Missouri folks not anyways
[02:28:32.280 --> 02:28:39.960]  not now again ladies and gentlemen we don't know this was Ebola what we know
[02:28:39.960 --> 02:28:43.440]  is is that common sense shows it would continue to spread and we know there's a
[02:28:43.440 --> 02:28:47.120]  cover-up they're telling firefighters and police cover it up so that right there
[02:28:47.120 --> 02:28:52.480]  we're investigating you talked to the medical doctor here in Texas what did he
[02:28:52.480 --> 02:28:58.720]  tell you Anthony Gutiarty turn his mic on thanks to called me start over go
[02:28:58.720 --> 02:29:01.880]  ahead the doctor we just spoke to was the one I called me freaking out saying
[02:29:01.880 --> 02:29:04.920]  the CEO called him they were getting thousands of calls to their medical
[02:29:04.920 --> 02:29:08.000]  center freaking out about Ebola but it comes of course that's what America would
[02:29:08.000 --> 02:29:11.600]  do is call her on two key facts number one I was the one who also spoke to
[02:29:11.600 --> 02:29:14.920]  close friend of mine who if he were to come on here right now and explain what
[02:29:14.920 --> 02:29:18.280]  he saw to me and if he actually went public with it it'd be over it would it
[02:29:18.280 --> 02:29:21.280]  would be international news immediately we're talking about someone that runs
[02:29:21.280 --> 02:29:24.400]  multiple hospitals and if he were that flies around a helicopter but do you see
[02:29:24.400 --> 02:29:29.560]  why he's so afraid now to go on air because unfortunately they know oh
[02:29:29.560 --> 02:29:33.280]  people don't won't get it and they'll go crazy and everyone to go after him
[02:29:33.280 --> 02:29:37.120]  they won't be thankful for him they'll go after him so you're not even allowed
[02:29:37.120 --> 02:29:40.920]  now to go out and say common sense if we let people with Ebola get on planes and
[02:29:40.920 --> 02:29:44.680]  fly here we might get Ebola you know we can't even go on that now because he's
[02:29:44.680 --> 02:29:48.200]  afraid to lose his medical license he goes and speaks to the fact that yes he's
[02:29:48.200 --> 02:29:53.560]  seen potential Ebola stay there stay there on the watch the entire zone
[02:29:53.560 --> 02:29:59.560]  Alex Jones and the GCN radio it's Truman Lakewood if the report came from Truman

[02:33:31.920 --> 02:33:37.600]  Jenin's bringing us in we're gonna go to Ben Jeff Frank who's a physician and
[02:33:37.600 --> 02:33:42.960]  others we've got Dan Dick suppress for truth up there in Ottawa the capital of
[02:33:42.960 --> 02:33:46.280]  Canada their parliament is in the background we're gonna go to him on the
[02:33:46.280 --> 02:33:49.520]  shooting yesterday could it be a false flag I don't know this guy looks like a
[02:33:49.520 --> 02:33:55.120]  useful idiot buffoon trying to commit suicide by terrorism but we're gonna get
[02:33:55.120 --> 02:33:59.480]  Dan Dix's take on that from the ground he's a Canadian who lives up there and
[02:33:59.480 --> 02:34:04.880]  done a lot of reporting for us but finishing up we talked to a medical
[02:34:04.880 --> 02:34:11.640]  doctor that we know who manages very large medical institution I mean has a
[02:34:11.640 --> 02:34:18.120]  lot of hospitals but I don't want to say too much to give it away in Texas and
[02:34:18.120 --> 02:34:21.800]  Anthony when we talked to him said hey let us go public and he said quite
[02:34:21.800 --> 02:34:26.400]  frankly the public won't understand it and he'll just come back on me and he
[02:34:26.400 --> 02:34:29.520]  said I'll they'll try to come out from a medical license if I tell folks what
[02:34:29.520 --> 02:34:35.000]  we're seeing up here well what they're seeing in a major city in in Texas even
[02:34:35.000 --> 02:34:37.680]  with the city now so I just sat on there started talking to other medical
[02:34:37.680 --> 02:34:46.480]  doctors Anthony mentions it James calls in the doctor calls in from Cass
[02:34:46.480 --> 02:34:49.760]  Regional Medical Center where they haven't had some suspicious cases
[02:34:49.760 --> 02:34:53.280]  haven't had at Cass Regional Medical Center and said the place where he did
[02:34:53.280 --> 02:34:57.440]  his residency Truman Lakewood he has people there doctors nurses he knows
[02:34:57.440 --> 02:35:00.760]  that are calling him saying it looks like Ebola acts like it needs to disappear
[02:35:00.760 --> 02:35:03.840]  the people well that's what the Border Patrol is telling us we have that
[02:35:03.840 --> 02:35:07.680]  article former Border Patrol agent CDC disappearing potential Ebola victims
[02:35:07.680 --> 02:35:11.320]  that's from October 10th so we're getting it from Border Patrol current
[02:35:11.320 --> 02:35:17.160]  former medical doctors other medical doctors and so that's what we're
[02:35:17.160 --> 02:35:21.920]  talking about so before we go to press for truth and shift gears and back into
[02:35:21.920 --> 02:35:26.960]  calls explain what this medical doctor that we know very well told told us
[02:35:26.960 --> 02:35:31.400]  Sharon he's not a listener he doesn't you know actually really get himself
[02:35:31.400 --> 02:35:35.000]  involved with all this information separately exactly and also coincides
[02:35:35.000 --> 02:35:38.600]  with what the Border Patrol saying with what Dr. Group saying about a Las Vegas
[02:35:38.600 --> 02:35:42.080]  conference of other medical doctors it's all the same thing basically he was
[02:35:42.080 --> 02:35:47.040]  telling me as this as James was they just classified as malaria and disappear
[02:35:47.040 --> 02:35:50.440]  people or specifically someone walks in with what looks like Ebola and
[02:35:50.440 --> 02:35:54.440]  oftentimes the hospitals and the nurses don't want to deal with it and the
[02:35:54.440 --> 02:35:57.800]  nurses one of his nurses was telling me she's gonna quit her job she hates
[02:35:57.800 --> 02:36:00.840]  people she hates dealing with them she doesn't want her family get Ebola
[02:36:00.840 --> 02:36:04.040]  because of these people and she can't handle and this is so sure this is you
[02:36:04.040 --> 02:36:07.360]  hanging out with some of the nurses yeah this was I'm not even gonna go into too
[02:36:07.360 --> 02:36:09.880]  much detail but anyway this type of nurses someone who would deal with Ebola
[02:36:09.880 --> 02:36:14.400]  patients and she was talking about how everyone is aware and Paul Watson was
[02:36:14.400 --> 02:36:18.400]  there as well awesome was there as well everyone in the medical community in
[02:36:18.400 --> 02:36:22.080]  Dallas is fully aware of it it's a big joke the CDC gives them nothing they
[02:36:22.080 --> 02:36:26.040]  were gonna say the city it's Dallas it's Dallas and there's hospitals in other
[02:36:26.040 --> 02:36:29.440]  regions as well but anyway it's a big joke up there the CDC doesn't give them
[02:36:29.440 --> 02:36:33.240]  enough preparation they know that there are Ebola cases going around or at least
[02:36:33.240 --> 02:36:37.040]  suspected Ebola cases what looks like Ebola and they classified as malaria or
[02:36:37.040 --> 02:36:40.560]  the CDC comes in and this is what the doctor was telling me the CDC comes in
[02:36:40.560 --> 02:36:44.480]  and basically takes it over and then after that it's under their jurisdiction
[02:36:44.480 --> 02:36:47.120]  and he doesn't have to deal with them anymore and I said why don't you come on
[02:36:47.120 --> 02:36:51.600]  air at least just tell us some of that he goes no no he said maybe if you let me
[02:36:51.600 --> 02:36:54.720]  use a voice changer but then he even said no he said you know why because it
[02:36:54.720 --> 02:36:58.280]  won't help they'll actually come after me and everyone will hate me for doing so
[02:36:58.280 --> 02:37:01.640]  they'll say he has it or so they'll say the Martians were there they'll say his
[02:37:01.640 --> 02:37:04.600]  hospital I mean we're just reporting on what's known they're telling cops cover
[02:37:04.600 --> 02:37:07.760]  it up they're telling firefighters we got the board patrol warning us it's
[02:37:07.760 --> 02:37:11.400]  confirmed there's suspicious stuff going on and who cares they're disappearing
[02:37:11.400 --> 02:37:15.560]  people it's all the fault of this American doctor who dared stick his
[02:37:15.560 --> 02:37:19.520]  head up it's all his fault it's a big joke and then you and then the whole
[02:37:19.520 --> 02:37:22.920]  thing is why are we even debating this because they're flying people over with
[02:37:22.920 --> 02:37:26.240]  Ebola into the United States and then letting nurses stretch and run around
[02:37:26.240 --> 02:37:29.480]  even though they admit it takes 56 days for some people with healthy immune
[02:37:29.480 --> 02:37:32.760]  systems to incubate Ebola they're letting them out after 21 days in
[02:37:32.760 --> 02:37:35.760]  quarantine and they're telling them oh you're sick you treated Ebola patients
[02:37:35.760 --> 02:37:38.960]  go ahead and fly cupcake go to a major city it's fine everything will be okay
[02:37:38.960 --> 02:37:41.760]  so these doctors know it's a big joke they're not idiots I mean these top
[02:37:41.760 --> 02:37:45.160]  doctors running these hospitals they they don't need to even look at the news
[02:37:45.160 --> 02:37:48.640]  they say well yeah they're letting nurses out who treated an Ebola patient when
[02:37:48.640 --> 02:37:52.480]  those are the only ones now openly getting Ebola letting let them go to a
[02:37:52.480 --> 02:37:56.360]  major city gee I wonder if we're gonna have Ebola cases and that's why the
[02:37:56.360 --> 02:37:59.120]  doctors are all freaking out because they're the ones that are the most
[02:37:59.120 --> 02:38:03.000]  informed about this saying well am I even gonna go to work anymore and that's
[02:38:03.000 --> 02:38:06.480]  why the nurses like he said exactly the same thing I was told by my friend the
[02:38:06.480 --> 02:38:10.520]  nurses are going to quit the medical infrastructure is going to start leaving
[02:38:10.520 --> 02:38:14.400]  their job Dr. Lorenzi is only saying what's already other papers that they're
[02:38:14.400 --> 02:38:17.760]  not being told and this is going on but see that's how bad it's not the open
[02:38:17.760 --> 02:38:20.720]  borders it's not the planes coming in it's not the factors of cover-up going
[02:38:20.720 --> 02:38:26.520]  on no it's the fault that we would dare say you know this is going on this
[02:38:26.520 --> 02:38:30.240]  needs to be investigated this doctor says people are being disappeared at
[02:38:30.240 --> 02:38:35.080]  another hospital the public can't even get it right and thinks it's his hospital
[02:38:35.080 --> 02:38:39.680]  it's just we're doomed I mean it's just incredible it's like if I apologize that
[02:38:39.680 --> 02:38:43.000]  we're telling you this is going on like if there's all my fault sinkhole and
[02:38:43.000 --> 02:38:45.640]  everyone is standing around the sinkhole saying look there's a sinkhole and we
[02:38:45.640 --> 02:38:48.960]  go in there we say look there's a giant sinkhole downtown and then everyone's
[02:38:48.960 --> 02:38:53.320]  like oh my god there's a sinkhole in Florida or they just you saw dinosaurs
[02:38:53.320 --> 02:38:57.400]  eating meeting people and yeah or this how do you know there's a sinkhole well
[02:38:57.400 --> 02:39:00.040]  every single person saw the sinkhole and it's talking about it and I'm getting
[02:39:00.040 --> 02:39:03.120]  calls about it in pictures everywhere well there's there's no sinkhole and
[02:39:03.120 --> 02:39:07.480]  must be on the moon or something it's it's not obviously they say no one this
[02:39:07.480 --> 02:39:11.880]  guy got in contact with got Ebola but two nurses in gear does anyone believe
[02:39:11.880 --> 02:39:17.920]  that and then the nurses left and then the nurses are sick flying around it is
[02:39:17.920 --> 02:39:20.680]  comical after a while when you think about it and then you know what's
[02:39:20.680 --> 02:39:24.640]  really comical is the news media now saying Ebola is fine it was only one
[02:39:24.640 --> 02:39:28.000]  guy that had it everything's okay nothing is happening you notice they
[02:39:28.000 --> 02:39:31.800]  don't have news articles about Ebola anymore they have talking points that
[02:39:31.800 --> 02:39:34.800]  was and the czar doesn't even show up to the meetings and says there's too many
[02:39:34.800 --> 02:39:38.800]  black people in Africa yeah you can't make this up no I mean I'm wondering who
[02:39:38.800 --> 02:39:42.800]  called CNN and others and said hey stop talking about this because it went from
[02:39:42.800 --> 02:39:46.800]  them freaking out about it like with actual nurses all of LA Times article
[02:39:46.800 --> 02:39:51.360]  where the nurses were like yeah the patient zero sat in the waiting room for
[02:39:51.360 --> 02:39:54.780]  four hours and we had no gear to treat him and he was brought in and we
[02:39:54.780 --> 02:39:59.240]  potentially contaminate the entire hazmat area people are dying vomiting on
[02:39:59.240 --> 02:40:03.040]  African flights out of areas ravaged on the plane they don't even test them
[02:40:03.040 --> 02:40:05.760]  they just go it's not Ebola and now they're like no no it's okay Ebola's
[02:40:05.760 --> 02:40:09.520]  not obvious cover-up does that mean all of these are gonna be real Ebola cases
[02:40:09.520 --> 02:40:13.680]  we don't know that they're not not a Ben Ebola at the Truman Lakewood Medical
[02:40:13.680 --> 02:40:17.280]  Center probably wasn't for all we know the point is is that their people are
[02:40:17.280 --> 02:40:20.920]  being whisk away I hope if I get whisk away there's an investigation Anthony
[02:40:20.920 --> 02:40:26.240]  how dare we ask I mean no it was top border patrol people saying yeah there's
[02:40:26.240 --> 02:40:30.240]  people with potential Ebola saying disappeared disappeared and then doctors
[02:40:30.240 --> 02:40:33.960]  independently again these are not people that listen to the show's coming up to
[02:40:33.960 --> 02:40:37.760]  me just this is people that we hang out with yeah exactly this is someone that's
[02:40:37.760 --> 02:40:43.080]  people we go out on boats with socially that we go you know sports golf you know
[02:40:43.080 --> 02:40:47.520]  you name it I mean you date some of the nurses and what's sad very horrible job
[02:40:47.520 --> 02:40:51.880]  it's a horrible life what's really sad is there is there not even freaking out
[02:40:51.880 --> 02:40:54.760]  he's not even saying like oh my god it's the ball he's just like yes there's
[02:40:54.760 --> 02:40:57.480]  probably Ebola in many hospitals and we're probably gonna have to deal with
[02:40:57.480 --> 02:41:01.280]  it the CDC is inept and we don't know what to do it's not like he's freaking
[02:41:01.280 --> 02:41:04.680]  out and then I'm like well you should be freaking out as well you know it's
[02:41:04.680 --> 02:41:08.400]  it's happening when they don't close off the borders to infected countries and
[02:41:08.400 --> 02:41:11.880]  they come over it's probably going to happen he's just matter of factly stating
[02:41:11.880 --> 02:41:15.400]  it but no but he was also saying that they've got the reports of them whisking
[02:41:15.400 --> 02:41:18.000]  away oh of course yeah because they disappear them and they can't find them
[02:41:18.000 --> 02:41:21.240]  in the medical records anymore just like he said that's what is freaking me out
[02:41:21.240 --> 02:41:24.880]  and no one seems to care what freaks me out the most is there independently
[02:41:24.880 --> 02:41:27.440]  saying all of these things saying with him saying the nurses are going to quit
[02:41:27.440 --> 02:41:30.880]  they go and look it up in the medical record system is not there anymore this
[02:41:30.880 --> 02:41:33.720]  is over and over again and they're not they don't know each other this is guy
[02:41:33.720 --> 02:41:38.280]  from up near Kansas City and this is someone from in Texas this is completely
[02:41:38.280 --> 02:41:40.320]  different areas and they're finding the same thing and they just say it's
[02:41:40.320 --> 02:41:43.080]  malaria and they're like well the symptoms are completely different they're
[02:41:43.080 --> 02:41:46.480]  they're bleeding out of their behind and they're they're urinating blood and
[02:41:46.480 --> 02:41:49.480]  they're like well that's okay the CDC will come in and determine it and then
[02:41:49.480 --> 02:41:55.160]  it's just nothing every time well I just want to say bad job there's no Ebola
[02:41:55.160 --> 02:42:00.120]  everything's fine we should go to Liberia to prove that we're not intolerant
[02:42:00.120 --> 02:42:03.040]  and that we want to keep the borders open we should go to Liberia no
[02:42:03.040 --> 02:42:13.200]  protection whatsoever and everything will be fine that's an okay I appreciate
[02:42:13.200 --> 02:42:16.560]  you Anthony great job we got a bunch of articles going up on info wars.com I
[02:42:16.560 --> 02:42:23.120]  want to apologize to our next guest here ladies and gentlemen because I ended up
[02:42:23.120 --> 02:42:26.160]  pushing back today but obviously he understands in news that happens Dan
[02:42:26.160 --> 02:42:31.040]  Dix press for truth I think it's.ca this is calm but great website great
[02:42:31.040 --> 02:42:34.600]  investigative journalists done a lot of investigative journals work for us and
[02:42:34.600 --> 02:42:37.680]  he's got the headline what happened in Ottawa up on his site we should post
[02:42:37.680 --> 02:42:41.880]  that article and that video Dan you're there in front of the Parliament where
[02:42:41.880 --> 02:42:45.400]  the shooting happened yesterday you would have thought that Godzilla descended
[02:42:45.400 --> 02:42:50.280]  destroying the city I know one man died and also the reported shooter died we
[02:42:50.280 --> 02:42:54.760]  know that the Royal Mount of Police got caught a few years ago nearby attacking
[02:42:54.760 --> 02:42:58.560]  themselves dressed up as anarchists they had to later admit that indeed that
[02:42:58.560 --> 02:43:02.560]  was a false flag but this doesn't look like a false flag to me because it was
[02:43:02.560 --> 02:43:06.640]  so inept he could only kill one person he got killed by the sergeant arms
[02:43:06.640 --> 02:43:11.480]  quickly but who knows nowadays stuff so fake you live up there Dan Dix so
[02:43:11.480 --> 02:43:15.720]  there's the Parliament right behind you I see a lot of press there what do you
[02:43:15.720 --> 02:43:20.960]  think happened well regardless of what happened one thing I do know is that
[02:43:20.960 --> 02:43:24.360]  this is going to completely change the political landscape here in Canada
[02:43:24.360 --> 02:43:28.480]  simply because of the way that people are reacting to this now whether or not
[02:43:28.480 --> 02:43:35.280]  this was a false flag or if this was a organic kind of rogue lash out is still
[02:43:35.280 --> 02:43:39.880]  remains to be seen but the bottom line is we do have to be careful as Canadians
[02:43:39.880 --> 02:43:44.840]  about how we respond to such a thing I'm finding I've interviewed a lot of people
[02:43:44.840 --> 02:43:48.760]  today and the general consensus is that everybody seems to be okay with the
[02:43:48.760 --> 02:43:53.920]  increase in a police state around here so long as it keeps people safe so the
[02:43:53.920 --> 02:43:59.000]  media is already touting this as being an act of terrorism there are newspapers
[02:43:59.000 --> 02:44:03.120]  all over the world saying terror has arrived here in Canada meanwhile we
[02:44:03.120 --> 02:44:07.360]  don't even have all the facts in on this guy yet but unfortunately the damage is
[02:44:07.360 --> 02:44:11.920]  done with headlines like that it it conditions the minds of the masses and
[02:44:11.920 --> 02:44:15.920]  the Canadian people to believe that there is a terrorist threat and meanwhile
[02:44:15.920 --> 02:44:20.720]  we don't even know if this is true yet or not expanding on that sometimes they
[02:44:20.720 --> 02:44:24.240]  have drills where they get somebody and then claim their Muslim convert and set
[02:44:24.240 --> 02:44:28.240]  them up like seven seven we know that was a false flag that's even come out and
[02:44:28.240 --> 02:44:31.560]  I've had retired intelligence officers from England on about it so we know they
[02:44:31.560 --> 02:44:34.600]  do this and the real amount of police got caught we wrote an article about it
[02:44:34.600 --> 02:44:38.200]  yesterday they were all wearing the same boots attacking police as a pretext and
[02:44:38.200 --> 02:44:43.560]  then attack the anti-wTO people and others so we know this stuff goes on but
[02:44:43.560 --> 02:44:48.840]  it could be some crazy you know person but I agree with you the response give up
[02:44:48.840 --> 02:44:52.840]  your rights you'll be safe and that they were barricading stuff hours after he was
[02:44:52.840 --> 02:44:57.120]  dead just the panicking with checkpoints the guy strutting around behind you
[02:44:57.120 --> 02:45:00.920]  right now kind of keeping an eye on you because you look so dangerous I mean how
[02:45:00.920 --> 02:45:05.200]  about they stop just letting all these people fly in unfettered see that's my
[02:45:05.200 --> 02:45:08.680]  issue you're gonna have open immigration do it but then don't take
[02:45:08.680 --> 02:45:12.200]  everybody's rights acting like internally you can set up checkpoints
[02:45:12.200 --> 02:45:16.120]  randomly when the main borders are open it's clearly a power grab look at our
[02:45:16.120 --> 02:45:20.640]  government funding ISIS I wonder how the Syrians like 300,000 people getting
[02:45:20.640 --> 02:45:24.720]  murdered the last four years by Western back jihadis that this guy they claim
[02:45:24.720 --> 02:45:28.800]  was connected to I mean what's gonna happen when ISIS does come over here and
[02:45:28.800 --> 02:45:33.960]  blow up schools or attack police stations I'm not given my rights up you
[02:45:33.960 --> 02:45:36.640]  know because they use stinger missiles to blow planes out of the sky that our
[02:45:36.640 --> 02:45:41.280]  government gave them Dan well tell you Alex they've been conditioning us to be
[02:45:41.280 --> 02:45:47.720]  afraid and to accept these draconian measures I put together a video called
[02:45:47.720 --> 02:45:51.360]  conditioning Canadians on the war on terror and if people want to see that
[02:45:51.360 --> 02:45:56.920]  it's available at press for truth.ca and in it we extensively document over the
[02:45:56.920 --> 02:46:01.040]  last six or seven years that all the various amounts of conditioning and
[02:46:01.040 --> 02:46:06.560]  set up that CISIS the Canadian Security and Intelligence Service and the RP CMP
[02:46:06.560 --> 02:46:13.520]  have been involved in when sometimes it may just be coercing an informant you
[02:46:13.520 --> 02:46:16.960]  know kind of setting out these guys up and incubating them in allowing some
[02:46:16.960 --> 02:46:22.080]  sort of attack to happen once they have become radicalized through the
[02:46:22.080 --> 02:46:26.840]  intelligence communities so we documented that extensively and how over the
[02:46:26.840 --> 02:46:31.400]  last six years there's been heavy conditioning here in Canada to basically
[02:46:31.400 --> 02:46:35.680]  you know as soon as something happens here the first thing everybody thinks
[02:46:35.680 --> 02:46:40.200]  is terrorist it must be terrorist and they've been setting this up for quite
[02:46:40.200 --> 02:46:44.560]  some time now trying to link these guys with the Islamic State ISIS as you may
[02:46:44.560 --> 02:46:50.760]  know Stephen Harper recently sent a whole fleet of F-18 fighters that's right
[02:46:50.760 --> 02:46:55.400]  and ISIS said they would then attack Canada remember that yeah exactly so now
[02:46:55.400 --> 02:46:59.960]  as you said is this a case of retaliation is this a rogue nut is this
[02:46:59.960 --> 02:47:04.520]  an all-out false flag which it very well could be as well remains to be
[02:47:04.520 --> 02:47:11.320]  on said to be seen but again we we simply just can't rush into bombing other
[02:47:11.320 --> 02:47:16.160]  countries and and removing all the rights of the Canadian people here because
[02:47:16.160 --> 02:47:20.560]  of because of this tragic incident well I mean in the old days there's a couple
[02:47:20.560 --> 02:47:23.400]  people got shot they'd find out to do responsible and bring them to justice
[02:47:23.400 --> 02:47:27.000]  everybody wouldn't roll around in total fear they should send one Texas Ranger
[02:47:27.000 --> 02:47:31.000]  to take on like a hundred people and they'd say wise you know why they only
[02:47:31.000 --> 02:47:34.440]  send one well that's because all we need to be to get into this mode of
[02:47:34.440 --> 02:47:38.880]  just guys with machine guns everywhere running around hysterical like a beehive
[02:47:38.880 --> 02:47:43.520]  when only two people got killed it's just it just it just looks like total
[02:47:43.520 --> 02:47:47.200]  drama queen behavior and looks pretty cowardly to me and again I'm just saying
[02:47:47.200 --> 02:47:50.840]  compared to the way people used to act anywhere this is not how you project
[02:47:50.840 --> 02:47:54.920]  strength is the barricading the freaking out the hyperventilating it looked
[02:47:54.920 --> 02:47:58.760]  like the I have told a Khomeini walked by earlier who were those folks did you
[02:47:58.760 --> 02:48:03.680]  see those guys look like Iranians yeah a number of people are still here if you
[02:48:03.680 --> 02:48:06.720]  want I can walk you up I walk you through here and give you a bit of a look
[02:48:06.720 --> 02:48:10.600]  at what what the scene really is like here I mean where there is a lot of
[02:48:10.600 --> 02:48:14.840]  media around right now doing interviews this is pretty much the front of the
[02:48:14.840 --> 02:48:19.840]  gate this is the memorial that is just being set up for the fallen soldiers so
[02:48:19.840 --> 02:48:24.720]  people have been coming here all day today paying their respects and a lot of
[02:48:24.720 --> 02:48:30.520]  media a lot of other kind of groups here so yeah those guys oh I'm not sure they
[02:48:30.520 --> 02:48:34.040]  just walked up but as soon as I'm done here I'm gonna try to interview those
[02:48:34.040 --> 02:48:37.720]  some of those guys so well it is a tragedy for the soldiers just sitting
[02:48:37.720 --> 02:48:42.320]  there on honor guard so he walks up and shoots him repeatedly and I've just seen
[02:48:42.320 --> 02:48:46.120]  a lot of witnesses that say they saw it it looked pretty credible it could be a
[02:48:46.120 --> 02:48:49.800]  false flag or you know you said he could be you know it's that FBI tactic even the
[02:48:49.800 --> 02:48:53.600]  New York Times reported on out of a hundred bombing plots in the US turned
[02:48:53.600 --> 02:48:58.400]  out 97 I think were you know hatched by the FBI if you read the report this is a
[02:48:58.400 --> 02:49:02.560]  very dangerous precedent and so I just don't think we can trust what we're
[02:49:02.560 --> 02:49:09.400]  being told well you know Alex it's come out that the soldier was armed with
[02:49:09.400 --> 02:49:14.400]  the gun but it turns out the gun is not loaded and they never never are and of
[02:49:14.400 --> 02:49:21.440]  course it is what's the point of having a soldier on guard if he is not not
[02:49:21.440 --> 02:49:25.960]  armed and of course we don't know yet what kind of a weapon or all we know is
[02:49:25.960 --> 02:49:30.240]  this is a long gun that was used yeah there is no way it looks like a 243 or
[02:49:30.240 --> 02:49:35.120]  it's a 3 a 30 30 or something but continuing here
[02:49:35.120 --> 02:49:39.240]  imagine being on guard duty at a parliament and you don't have a loaded
[02:49:39.240 --> 02:49:44.760]  gun it's a major target yeah this is just ridiculous and I mean why
[02:49:44.760 --> 02:49:48.440]  government has all this police tape and they can't protect the parliament I mean
[02:49:48.440 --> 02:49:54.200]  that is ridiculous yeah that's just it I mean apparently this guy walks up to the
[02:49:54.200 --> 02:49:59.320]  soldier and he shoots him he then manages to make his way a great deal I
[02:49:59.320 --> 02:50:04.680]  can show you here is the monument and parliament building is all the way over
[02:50:04.680 --> 02:50:10.920]  there and 300 yards I've been there it's about 300 yards yeah yeah I mean it is
[02:50:10.920 --> 02:50:17.560]  yeah and he managed to go from there into the parliament building where there
[02:50:17.560 --> 02:50:21.520]  are security checks to get by there there are metal detectors there are you know
[02:50:21.520 --> 02:50:28.240]  security guards you got to get by yeah so he managed to get why was it the
[02:50:28.240 --> 02:50:32.160]  sergeant of arms that shot him I mean that I mean that these sergeant arms
[02:50:32.160 --> 02:50:34.880]  out of probably a hundred security people would be the person to shoot him
[02:50:34.880 --> 02:50:42.120]  I mean maybe the security isn't allowed to have guns yeah well I do know that
[02:50:42.120 --> 02:50:48.320]  none of the footage inside of there actually has any clips of this guy they
[02:50:48.320 --> 02:50:52.760]  can't seem to find them any video that sounds suspicious Dan Dick stay there

[02:56:21.680 --> 02:56:25.760]  got left and I want to invite you on the nightly news there if they can tape
[02:56:25.760 --> 02:56:29.000]  some of that with you for later tonight so you can expand on the amazing
[02:56:29.000 --> 02:56:32.280]  reporting you're doing but in a few minutes we've got left other points
[02:56:32.280 --> 02:56:36.760]  you'd like to make from the scene of the battle for Ottawa as it's being called
[02:56:36.760 --> 02:56:42.080]  greater than the Nazi Blitz on London everyone rolling around on the ground in
[02:56:42.080 --> 02:56:46.120]  fear begging for big brother to watch everything they do to keep them safe from
[02:56:46.120 --> 02:56:50.560]  ISIS that the Canadian government's been part of army well Alex I would just
[02:56:50.560 --> 02:56:57.320]  beg people not to fear their governments not to fear this is land
[02:56:57.320 --> 02:57:04.760]  Islamic State and to realize that this is indeed about getting us into going
[02:57:04.760 --> 02:57:09.720]  along with some of these plans that they have for Canadians so I just want to
[02:57:09.720 --> 02:57:15.160]  encourage Canadians to to to remember that we just can't simply just jump all
[02:57:15.160 --> 02:57:18.680]  over this and listen to what the mainstream media is reporting because
[02:57:18.680 --> 02:57:24.320]  they're doing a very shoddy job I must say so that's why we we just decided to
[02:57:24.320 --> 02:57:27.000]  come down here and get on the grounds and try to get to the bottom of what's
[02:57:27.000 --> 02:57:31.000]  going on if this does indeed turn out to be a false flag if we find out this
[02:57:31.000 --> 02:57:36.120]  guy was on SSRI drugs or or he was involved in the military all these
[02:57:36.120 --> 02:57:40.760]  things will come out but remember they're already calling it terrorism do not be
[02:57:40.760 --> 02:57:45.880]  afraid of terrorism here in Canada and if it does always remember folks that
[02:57:45.880 --> 02:57:50.440]  suspect number one is definitely the state because that's who stands to gain
[02:57:50.440 --> 02:57:54.120]  in the power grab and has been caught doing it over and over again and I love
[02:57:54.120 --> 02:57:57.120]  how they were aiming guns at reporters yesterday and saying don't report and
[02:57:57.120 --> 02:58:02.840]  there's a security guard or cop keeps walking around giving you the eye I mean
[02:58:02.840 --> 02:58:07.760]  because you're just so suspicious Dan yeah yeah well I guess we're sometimes
[02:58:07.760 --> 02:58:12.880]  perhaps considered the enemy in these types of environments so I'll have to
[02:58:12.880 --> 02:58:17.880]  be careful out here Alex now is it is the Parliament is a beautiful neogothic
[02:58:17.880 --> 02:58:22.200]  instruction built I guess about a hundred years ago I spent hours looking at

[03:00:36.720 --> 03:00:40.840]  your take on the Ebola situation medical doctors telling us they see what they
[03:00:40.840 --> 03:00:48.280]  believe was Ebola cases and then people are disappearing great job mr. mr.
[03:00:48.280 --> 03:00:56.440]  alex I would not be surprised at that but my take on it is I'm thinking that if
[03:00:56.440 --> 03:01:02.120]  this virus that if it was Ebola is mutating you need to get samples if
[03:01:02.120 --> 03:01:07.560]  you're gonna make a vaccine off of it so you can have the latest and greatest
[03:01:07.560 --> 03:01:11.760]  the other thing is I think I sent you show a couple a couple of weeks ago I
[03:01:11.760 --> 03:01:16.000]  was also the the family practice and hyperbaric position I think I sent you
[03:01:16.000 --> 03:01:20.520]  some information regarding something that came out actually last October in
[03:01:20.520 --> 03:01:26.880]  2013 and from a journal of orology where it said the hemoxygenase one enzyme
[03:01:26.880 --> 03:01:32.640]  actually stopped the Ebola virus replication and you know I I would say
[03:01:32.640 --> 03:01:36.640]  I've been a little bit consumed with this and so you know with my interest in
[03:01:36.640 --> 03:01:41.040]  hyperbaric since that is a subspecialty in mind I actually found that if you put
[03:01:41.040 --> 03:01:44.200]  yourself in a chamber you're actually and this is all documented this is
[03:01:44.200 --> 03:01:48.560]  research that's out there I think your your staff might have it it shows that
[03:01:48.560 --> 03:01:52.240]  if you go in a chamber hyperbaric chamber you're actually up regularly
[03:01:52.240 --> 03:01:57.480]  you're him your hemoxygenase one and you know absolutely Ebola can't live in
[03:01:57.480 --> 03:02:01.360]  oxygen and things and I'm no doctor like you but I've seen the medical
[03:02:01.360 --> 03:02:05.000]  literature about with viruses and other things going in hyperbaric chambers
[03:02:05.000 --> 03:02:08.280]  that's what the royal family and others do they also put their blood through
[03:02:08.280 --> 03:02:12.560]  different systems with UV light and things Joel Scousen's daughter couldn't
[03:02:12.560 --> 03:02:16.680]  get rid of MRSA knocked it out for her you know I couldn't get rid of a chest
[03:02:16.680 --> 03:02:21.680]  cold my dad couldn't coil silver knocked it out I mean it worked I mean I went
[03:02:21.680 --> 03:02:27.880]  with the antibiotics first like a dummy but it's just amazing thank you so much
[03:02:27.880 --> 03:02:31.600]  thanks for the call Jeff and Indiana you're on the air a firefighter what's
[03:02:31.600 --> 03:02:38.200]  your take on this well how you doing Alex good sir hey I get real quick I
[03:02:38.200 --> 03:02:42.280]  kind of want to reiterate what the guy called earlier from the Bronx was he
[03:02:42.280 --> 03:02:47.480]  a firefighter or a policeman I believe was a firefighter yeah well I work for
[03:02:47.480 --> 03:02:50.720]  the National Fire Department after 25 years more than one of the biggest in
[03:02:50.720 --> 03:02:55.560]  the country and we've had very more training on this the training that we
[03:02:55.560 --> 03:03:01.000]  have had on it is basically it was a 20 minute you know computer training
[03:03:01.000 --> 03:03:05.400]  and you can tell that this training was sent right from the CDC because it said
[03:03:05.400 --> 03:03:10.040]  things like you know wash your hands it's not airborne it can only live on
[03:03:10.040 --> 03:03:14.200]  surface for a few minutes we've been given zero equipment to deal with this
[03:03:14.200 --> 03:03:18.400]  the EMS aspect that the EMS department in that but they've actually given them
[03:03:18.400 --> 03:03:22.480]  some Tyvek suit and respirators but they're given the fire department nothing
[03:03:22.480 --> 03:03:29.120]  and the thing about the firefighters we will be we're gonna encounter this way
[03:03:29.120 --> 03:03:32.480]  before the doctors and nurses do because most firefighters in the United
[03:03:32.480 --> 03:03:37.520]  States that have paid professional firefighters are also EMP so 85% of what
[03:03:37.520 --> 03:03:42.040]  we do is EMS related and we will have we will be the first ones rolling in on
[03:03:42.040 --> 03:03:46.000]  this and we were instructed in the training that it's not to be called
[03:03:46.000 --> 03:03:49.720]  Ebola we'll have to say Ebola down there I can't remember what they told us
[03:03:49.720 --> 03:03:54.040]  but then it's going to be this batch has like a code 75 or something but it's not
[03:03:54.040 --> 03:04:00.760]  going to be you know we're not to say Ebola so but the problem is you know we
[03:04:00.760 --> 03:04:05.120]  could walk right the way to dispatch things lots of times it's not necessary
[03:04:05.120 --> 03:04:07.840]  what you're going to because the people who are taking the phone calls don't pay
[03:04:07.840 --> 03:04:11.120]  attention or whatever and we could walk right into the stuff and not even know
[03:04:11.120 --> 03:04:16.720]  it exactly if they don't really know that this is a hazardous material special
[03:04:16.720 --> 03:04:21.280]  caution at least and people just walk right into it well you know I was also
[03:04:21.280 --> 03:04:24.760]  on the hazmat team for five years and one of the most important things when you
[03:04:24.760 --> 03:04:28.600]  do it any type of hazardous materials incident which I consider if it's true
[03:04:28.600 --> 03:04:33.960]  Ebola to be hazardous material oh yeah is the decadent decontamination process
[03:04:33.960 --> 03:04:38.200]  and when you take off your protective gear you can't just put a suit on walk
[03:04:38.200 --> 03:04:42.760]  in deal with the patient and then just take it off and forget about it you know
[03:04:42.760 --> 03:04:46.800]  when you come out of it let's say you know a chlorine leak or an acid leak
[03:04:46.800 --> 03:04:50.840]  yeah there's a huge event that goes on all around it or you'll just catch it
[03:04:50.840 --> 03:04:54.120]  when you take the suit off or give it to others absolutely that's why this is so
[03:04:54.120 --> 03:04:57.920]  incredible is it just one patient and clog up a whole hospital thank you so
[03:04:57.920 --> 03:05:23.880]  much we're out of time nightly news tonight seven
