[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:27.200]  Dr. David Martin was recently a guest at the European Union and laid out the timeline for
[00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:30.520]  the biggest democide in recorded history.
[00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:34.120]  You can see the full video on Band.Video.
[00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:35.960]  This is my short edit.
[00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:44.240]  Coronavirus was identified in 1965 as one of the first infectious replicatable viral
[00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:50.640]  models that could be used to modify a series of other experiences of the human condition.
[00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:55.640]  What's particularly interesting about its isolation in 1965 was that it was immediately
[00:00:55.640 --> 00:01:01.200]  identified as a pathogen that could be used and modified for a whole host of reasons.
[00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:11.560]  In 1966, the very first COV coronavirus model was used as a transatlantic biological experiment
[00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:13.040]  in human manipulation.
[00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:19.680]  And in 1967, we did the first human trials on inoculating people with modified coronavirus.
[00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:25.520]  The common cold was turned into a chimera in the 1970s.
[00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:33.080]  And in 1975, 1976 and 1977, we started figuring out how to modify coronavirus by putting it
[00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:36.880]  into different animals, pigs and dogs.
[00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:42.600]  And that became the basis for Pfizer's first spike protein vaccine patent filed, are you
[00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.520]  ready for this, in 1990.
[00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:49.960]  And in 1990, they found out that there was a problem with vaccines.
[00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:52.200]  They didn't work.
[00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.600]  It turns out that coronavirus is a very malleable model.
[00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:58.440]  It transforms and it changes and it mutates over time.
[00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:07.160]  As a matter of fact, every publication on vaccines for coronavirus from 1990 until 2018,
[00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:15.080]  every single publication concluded that coronavirus escapes the vaccine impulse.
[00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:20.280]  And in 2002, the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill patented, and I quote, an infectious
[00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:24.240]  replication defective clone of coronavirus.
[00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:29.480]  And that work patented at the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill mysteriously preceded
[00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:34.480]  SARS 1.0 by a year in 2005.
[00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:42.400]  This particular pathogen was specifically labeled as a bioterrorism and bioweapon platform technology.
[00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:48.600]  And from 2005 onwards, it was actually a biowarfare enabling agent.
[00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:50.200]  It's official classification.
[00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:56.160]  We have been lured into believing that EcoHealth Alliance and DARPA and all of these organizations
[00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:57.720]  are what we should be pointing to.
[00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:05.840]  But we've been specifically requested to ignore the facts that over $10 billion have been
[00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:11.200]  funneled through black operations, through the check of Anthony Fauci and a side by side
[00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:18.440]  ledger where NIAID has a balance sheet and next to it is a biodefense balance sheet equivalent
[00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:22.560]  dollar for dollar matching that no one in the media talks about.
[00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:31.040]  Poised for human emergence in 2016 at the proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences,
[00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:38.520]  such that by the time we get to 2017 and 2018, the following phrase entered into common parlance
[00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:40.640]  among the community.
[00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:47.200]  There is going to be an accidental or intentional release of a respiratory pathogen.
[00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:53.120]  Seven months before the allegation of patient number one, four patent applications of Moderna
[00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:59.120]  were modified to include the term accidental or intentional release of a respiratory pathogen
[00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:04.000]  as the justification for making a vaccine for a thing that did not exist.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:09.080]  The intent was to get the world to accept a universal vaccine template and the intent
[00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:11.280]  was to use coronavirus to get there.
[00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:16.120]  This was premeditated domestic terrorism stated at the proceedings of the National Academy
[00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:18.120]  of Sciences in 2015.
[00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:23.160]  That sound like a bat and a pangolin went into a bar in the Wuhan market.
[00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:28.400]  This is an act of biological and chemical warfare perpetrated on the human race.
[00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:34.240]  See the full video at band dot video on this Memorial Day weekend.
[00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:39.920]  Let us remember our friends and family that we've lost in this war against we, the people
[00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:42.480]  being waged by our own government.
[00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:47.600]  And let us never rest until there is justice reporting for InfoWars.
[00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:48.600]  This is Greg Reese.
[00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:57.360]  And of course, you can find all of Greg Reese's reports at band dot video and Mad Max World
[00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:58.360]  dot TV.

[00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:46.200]  And we are grateful that you choose to spend your Sunday evening with us here on this
[00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:50.640]  May 28th, 2023 edition of the Alex Jones Show.
[00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:56.360]  We're going to have a news heavy broadcast tonight, a news heavy broadcast.
[00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:58.600]  I got a ton of news.
[00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:07.400]  We're going to expand on what we saw from the latest special report from Greg Reese.
[00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:10.740]  How can the whole world know it's so obvious?
[00:07:10.740 --> 00:07:17.680]  How can the whole world know that the COVID-19 pandemic was a scam?
[00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:18.720]  It was planned out.
[00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:20.440]  It was done intentionally.
[00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:22.960]  There were motivations behind it.
[00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:29.600]  And yet the perpetrators, the criminals, the mad scientists, the murderers responsible
[00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:40.200]  for that are somehow, it's like you can't even, they don't even slip through your fingertips.
[00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:41.920]  You can't even grab them.
[00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:50.480]  It's like they completely elude justice, despite here it is 2023 and the whole world
[00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:51.480]  knows.
[00:07:51.480 --> 00:07:57.560]  When you have top delegations in Europe meeting, like in that video, we'll have more of that,
[00:07:57.560 --> 00:08:00.880]  by the way, with Dr. David Martin.
[00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:01.880]  We're going to play more of that.
[00:08:01.880 --> 00:08:04.320]  We do have the full video.
[00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:05.320]  It's just amazing.
[00:08:05.320 --> 00:08:11.840]  But there's other news when it comes to the World Health Organization, when it comes to
[00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:16.800]  what Russia is doing in Ukraine, and then also when it comes to the vaccines.
[00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:21.720]  Now, I get this a lot, and this is good news, folks.
[00:08:21.720 --> 00:08:23.840]  Hey, what happened to the vaccine injuries?
[00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:25.640]  We don't hear much about the vaccine injuries.
[00:08:25.640 --> 00:08:31.040]  Well, maybe we're kind of through the first phase of this to figure out what's really
[00:08:31.040 --> 00:08:32.800]  going on.
[00:08:32.800 --> 00:08:36.480]  And most people didn't go for the second booster, the third booster, the fourth booster.
[00:08:36.480 --> 00:08:38.860]  That's when you really put yourself in danger.
[00:08:38.860 --> 00:08:43.720]  So it might be you get one of these things and you can either just survive with whatever
[00:08:43.720 --> 00:08:48.240]  it does to you, or maybe you got hit with, we'll say, a placebo.
[00:08:49.104 --> 00:08:57.264]  But, hey, maybe you only got one of these things, odds are you're going to be okay.
[00:08:57.264 --> 00:08:58.344]  Not for everybody.
[00:08:58.344 --> 00:09:01.344]  But you got the boosters, and man, it's ramping up.
[00:09:01.344 --> 00:09:08.264]  So, still vaccine injuries happening, but we may have really, they didn't get the numbers
[00:09:08.264 --> 00:09:16.264]  they wanted when it comes to the quote-unquote COVID deaths, or what you might find in the
[00:09:16.264 --> 00:09:26.704]  Vaccine Adverse Reaction Database, all of the COVID-19 vaccine deaths that are more
[00:09:26.704 --> 00:09:32.624]  dead from this COVID-19 vaccine than any other vaccine in medical history combined, at least
[00:09:32.624 --> 00:09:35.584]  to the reporting that we have access to on the VAERS website.
[00:09:35.584 --> 00:09:38.264]  So, we're going to tie all that together.
[00:09:38.264 --> 00:09:45.224]  Now, the big news is the clown debt, the clown debt ceiling.
[00:09:45.224 --> 00:09:47.464]  Jay wants to talk about the clown debt ceiling.
[00:09:48.428 --> 00:09:54.428]  But we don't want to talk about the elephant in the room, which is, so what now?
[00:09:54.428 --> 00:10:03.428]  The average American goes from owing, if you believe this economic theory, and I guess it is just a theory,
[00:10:03.428 --> 00:10:14.428]  or if you accept your servitude to the Federal Reserve, every American household owes, I think, $96,000.
[00:10:14.428 --> 00:10:17.428]  That's the U.S. debt divided by every citizen.
[00:10:17.428 --> 00:10:19.428]  Oh, what about the non-citizens that are here?
[00:10:19.428 --> 00:10:21.428]  Well, maybe then it goes down to $75,000.
[00:10:21.428 --> 00:10:23.428]  I'm sure they'll be willing to pay it.
[00:10:23.428 --> 00:10:26.428]  But who's going to pay that debt?
[00:10:26.428 --> 00:10:29.428]  No, it just keeps going up and up and up and up and up.
[00:10:29.428 --> 00:10:33.428]  And we just never ask the obvious question.
[00:10:33.428 --> 00:10:39.428]  We just never look to the obvious.
[00:10:39.428 --> 00:10:41.428]  The whole system is a joke.
[00:10:41.428 --> 00:10:43.428]  The whole system is used to control you.
[00:10:43.428 --> 00:10:47.428]  The whole centralization of banking is meant to enslave you.
[00:10:47.428 --> 00:10:51.428]  And it's all going to the digital currency, so they don't care.
[00:10:51.428 --> 00:10:59.428]  $40 trillion in debt, $100 trillion in debt, fund unlimited IRS agents, fund limited IRS agents, it doesn't matter.
[00:10:59.428 --> 00:11:02.428]  They've got to get the central bank digital currency.
[00:11:02.428 --> 00:11:09.428]  And they have to prop up all their fiat currencies in the meantime so that they can have a smooth transition.
[00:11:09.428 --> 00:11:13.428]  That's why they're bailing out all the banks.
[00:11:13.428 --> 00:11:20.428]  And then you're just fully into the digital slave state.
[00:11:20.428 --> 00:11:25.428]  Can't buy or sell unless you're a good slave.
[00:11:25.428 --> 00:11:27.428]  You've got to have a good social credit score.
[00:11:27.428 --> 00:11:31.428]  You've got to have a good carbon credit score.
[00:11:31.428 --> 00:11:34.428]  You've got to be a good liberal progressive Democrat.
[00:11:34.428 --> 00:11:39.428]  Yeah.
[00:11:39.428 --> 00:11:41.428]  Now apparently they've reached a deal.
[00:11:41.428 --> 00:11:43.428]  I don't want to make a big thing about this.
[00:11:43.428 --> 00:11:46.428]  It's all clown debt anyway.
[00:11:46.428 --> 00:11:57.428]  But it'll be a major moment for Kevin McCarthy to either say, hey, I did something, or to get lambasted for doing nothing.
[00:11:57.428 --> 00:12:00.428]  And right now it looks like the latter.
[00:12:00.428 --> 00:12:06.428]  But why would you want to negotiate with Joe Biden anyway when you know all the crimes he's responsible for?
[00:12:06.428 --> 00:12:15.428]  But then they want to come after one of the great attorney generals in the United States of America.
[00:12:15.428 --> 00:12:18.428]  And that's Attorney General Ken Paxson here in Texas.
[00:12:18.428 --> 00:12:27.428]  It's actually just disgusting stuff what's happened here in the Texas Republican Party in the last, let's say, four weeks.
[00:12:28.428 --> 00:12:38.428]  You know, I'm not going to sit here and judge a human that makes the same mistakes that I've made or that people make commonly.
[00:12:38.428 --> 00:12:44.428]  But it's just it's really a clown show, unfortunately, what's going on in the Texas GOP now.
[00:12:44.428 --> 00:12:51.428]  Unable to control their drinking habits, unable to control their lust for one another.
[00:12:51.428 --> 00:12:58.428]  And so now Ken Paxton is getting impeached because the Texas GOP is in absolute shambles.
[00:12:58.428 --> 00:13:03.428]  Now, somehow throughout this, they've been able to have some major policy victories.
[00:13:03.428 --> 00:13:11.428]  Just with the overwhelming number of votes, but now Ken Paxton, the swamp of Texas trying to drain Ken Paxton.
[00:13:11.428 --> 00:13:14.428]  And so we'll talk a little bit about that.
[00:13:14.428 --> 00:13:18.428]  And you need to beware if you're in other states and you've got a good attorney general.
[00:13:18.428 --> 00:13:20.428]  This is how they're going to come for yours next.
[00:13:20.428 --> 00:13:24.428]  So they tried to get an establishment attorney general in there.
[00:13:24.428 --> 00:13:28.428]  I believe it was George Bush, not George W. I think it was George P.
[00:13:28.428 --> 00:13:31.428]  It was a brother-in-law or something, you know, the old deal.
[00:13:31.428 --> 00:13:33.428]  And they couldn't get him in.
[00:13:33.428 --> 00:13:37.428]  And so now they're just trying to reverse the results of that election and get Paxton out via impeachment.
[00:13:37.428 --> 00:13:41.428]  And the Republican Party went along for the ride because it's got so many problems here.
[00:13:42.428 --> 00:13:46.428]  The culture wars.
[00:13:46.428 --> 00:13:49.428]  Will we, we will, what do you even call it?
[00:13:49.428 --> 00:13:54.428]  Will we be conquered by the LGBTQ pedophile plus propaganda?
[00:13:54.428 --> 00:14:05.428]  Or can we just go back to normal where, you know, you can go out to dinner or go to the gym or go to a ball game or turn on the television and not get overwhelmed with sexual propaganda aimed at children.
[00:14:05.428 --> 00:14:08.428]  That battle is on.
[00:14:08.428 --> 00:14:11.428]  We've got some.
[00:14:11.428 --> 00:14:14.428]  Examples of victories.
[00:14:14.428 --> 00:14:16.428]  You've got some examples of losses.
[00:14:16.428 --> 00:14:19.428]  We're going to cover that as well.
[00:14:19.428 --> 00:14:22.428]  It's sad, but every time I come on air.
[00:14:22.428 --> 00:14:27.428]  On Sunday, one of the top stories always every weekend is the weekend violence.
[00:14:27.428 --> 00:14:31.428]  And it's just the same story this weekend.
[00:14:32.428 --> 00:14:44.428]  Always in the Democrat cities, which is where they have the problems from San Francisco, Seattle, Washington, D.C., Baltimore, New York, Chicago.
[00:14:44.428 --> 00:14:45.428]  Yikes.
[00:14:45.428 --> 00:14:46.428]  Already Memorial Day shootings.
[00:14:46.428 --> 00:14:47.428]  It's always bad.
[00:14:47.428 --> 00:14:48.428]  Then the summer kicks off.
[00:14:48.428 --> 00:14:50.428]  It just gets worse.
[00:14:50.428 --> 00:14:57.428]  These are all gun free zones, by the way, run by Democrats, but they seem to have the worst problems with gun violence.
[00:14:57.428 --> 00:14:59.428]  Funny in it.
[00:15:00.428 --> 00:15:10.428]  But now today's show headline is about how the dam is breaking and the establishment's grip on even the minds of the most brainwashed leftist is starting to slip.
[00:15:10.428 --> 00:15:13.428]  And it's the war issue that's starting to bring them back down to earth.
[00:15:13.428 --> 00:15:20.428]  Major protests at an AOC event this weekend, by the way, Justin Trudeau can't even go out in public anymore.
[00:15:20.428 --> 00:15:27.428]  And then Tulsi Gabbard goes on cable news over the weekend and says the Democrats are an elitist cabal of warmongers.
[00:15:27.428 --> 00:15:40.428]  So this Biden war in Ukraine, this illegal war that Biden has launched against Russia is bringing far left liberal progressives back down to earth, folks.
[00:15:40.428 --> 00:15:47.428]  And to their credit, they're going after the Democrats in their local districts, calling them out for it.
[00:15:47.428 --> 00:15:53.428]  So we've got all that and more on tonight's edition of the Alex Jones Show.
[00:15:53.428 --> 00:15:59.428]  Owens Royer honored to be spending this Sunday evening with you.
[00:15:59.428 --> 00:16:02.428]  Please give me one minute of your time.
[00:16:02.428 --> 00:16:04.428]  Please write this down and please go look this up.
[00:16:04.428 --> 00:16:06.428]  It will change your life.
[00:16:06.428 --> 00:16:15.428]  The U.N. admits in the Lansing Medical Journal admits that upwards of two billion people have mental disabilities and declining cognitive abilities.
[00:16:15.428 --> 00:16:20.428]  The term they use is intellectual disability because of lack of iodine.
[00:16:20.428 --> 00:16:24.428]  Most iodine in the environment is bound to other elements.
[00:16:24.428 --> 00:16:26.428]  So your body can't absorb it.
[00:16:26.428 --> 00:16:30.428]  Only pure iodine can really be absorbed right into the cells.
[00:16:31.428 --> 00:16:37.428]  And Infowarsstore.com has the only iodine out there that actually has this type of full effect.
[00:16:37.428 --> 00:16:40.428]  Ladies and gentlemen, X3 has been sold out for six months.
[00:16:40.428 --> 00:16:42.428]  It's very hard to produce.
[00:16:42.428 --> 00:16:44.428]  And it's finally back in stock.
[00:16:44.428 --> 00:16:46.428]  In fact, I was just taking some before I shot this ad.
[00:16:46.428 --> 00:16:48.428]  This, ladies and gentlemen, is powerful.
[00:16:48.428 --> 00:16:50.428]  You and your family need it.
[00:16:50.428 --> 00:16:52.428]  It's 25 percent off back in stock.
[00:16:52.428 --> 00:16:56.428]  X3, triiodine, exclusively at Infowarsstore.com.
[00:16:56.428 --> 00:16:57.428]  Take action now.
[00:16:57.428 --> 00:16:59.428]  But regardless, research is info.
[00:16:59.428 --> 00:17:06.427]  They decided to not perp walking, not put him in handcuffs, not do a mugshot because they knew that that would help Trump.
[00:17:06.427 --> 00:17:08.427]  Didn't they know this would backfire?
[00:17:08.427 --> 00:17:09.427]  We were waiting for the mugshot.
[00:17:09.427 --> 00:17:12.427]  We learned today they wouldn't have it, so we've made our own.
[00:17:12.427 --> 00:17:17.427]  And it says political prisoner with an image of President Trump.
[00:17:17.427 --> 00:17:19.427]  The shirt is being printed now in Texas.
[00:17:19.427 --> 00:17:21.427]  It'll be shipping out to you in one week.
[00:17:21.427 --> 00:17:25.427]  Political prisoner with Trump on the front.
[00:17:25.427 --> 00:17:28.427]  They're in a mugshot jail background.
[00:17:28.427 --> 00:17:29.427]  It's a fundraiser shirt.
[00:17:29.427 --> 00:17:33.427]  It says Infowars.com on the back of the shirt.
[00:17:33.427 --> 00:17:35.427]  We also have Alex Jones for president.
[00:17:35.427 --> 00:17:36.427]  No, I'm not running for president.
[00:17:36.427 --> 00:17:38.427]  It's a really nice navy blue, high-quality shirt.
[00:17:38.427 --> 00:17:39.427]  Red, white, and blue.
[00:17:39.427 --> 00:17:40.427]  Alex Jones for president.
[00:17:40.427 --> 00:17:41.427]  0.24.
[00:17:41.427 --> 00:17:43.427]  It's a fun conversational piece and a limited edition shirt.
[00:17:43.427 --> 00:17:45.427]  Great way to fund the operation.
[00:17:45.427 --> 00:17:57.427]  So get your Alex Jones for president and Trump mugshot shirts at Infowarsstore.com or by calling toll-free 888-253-3139.
[00:17:58.427 --> 00:18:06.427]  In the early 1900s, certain companies were off-gassing highly toxic fluoride gases into the atmosphere.
[00:18:06.427 --> 00:18:09.427]  The surrounding communities began to get sick.
[00:18:09.427 --> 00:18:17.427]  Laws were enacted to compel these corporations to install scrubbers to convert these gases into fluorosilicic acid.
[00:18:17.427 --> 00:18:20.427]  Still highly toxic, but containable.
[00:18:20.427 --> 00:18:23.427]  Now these companies had a stockpile of this poison.
[00:18:23.427 --> 00:18:26.427]  And there was no affordable way to dispose of it.
[00:18:26.427 --> 00:18:34.427]  Lucky for them, one of their major stockholders was also the secretary of the treasury, who was responsible for the public health service at the time.
[00:18:34.427 --> 00:18:43.427]  And by 1950, the U.S. government began buying this toxic, untreated industrial waste product and dumping it into our drinking water.
[00:18:43.427 --> 00:18:48.427]  Reputable studies show that it's causing various cancers and other disease.
[00:18:48.427 --> 00:18:52.427]  With the Alexa Pure Pro, you can have clean drinking water.
[00:18:52.427 --> 00:18:54.427]  And a remedy to this madness.
[00:18:54.427 --> 00:18:58.427]  Available now at infowarsstore.com.
[00:18:58.427 --> 00:19:07.427]  Ladies and gentlemen, this book, The Great Reset and the War for the World, is a historic book that documents the globalists in their own words, planned for our future.
[00:19:07.427 --> 00:19:08.427]  That is a hellish future.
[00:19:08.427 --> 00:19:18.427]  Now you'll always, while they still allow books, I guess they're starting to ban them, be able to get an unsigned copy of The Great Reset and the War for the World at bookstores, Amazon, or infowarsstore.com.
[00:19:18.427 --> 00:19:24.427]  But you will never be able to get another signed copy of the book after the signed copies we got run out.
[00:19:24.427 --> 00:19:26.427]  And there's about a thousand left of them right now.
[00:19:26.427 --> 00:19:32.427]  So get your copy of The Great Reset and the War for the World, a signed copy, at infowarsstore.com.
[00:19:32.427 --> 00:19:36.427]  And there is a markup there because this is a fundraiser to keep us on the air.
[00:19:36.427 --> 00:19:42.427]  So you won't just have this historic memento and this powerful book, you'll also know that you help keep Infowars on the air.
[00:19:42.427 --> 00:19:46.427]  I want to thank those of you that have gotten signed copies of the book, or unsigned copies.
[00:19:46.427 --> 00:19:56.427]  And I encourage all of you who haven't yet to go to infowarsstore.com and get a signed copy and buy a couple of unsigned copies and donate them to the library or give them to the local school.
[00:19:56.427 --> 00:19:59.427]  This is an Infowar, I'm counting on you, and thank you for your support.
[00:20:00.427 --> 00:20:06.427]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[00:20:08.150 --> 00:20:24.790]  Forget about the polls, forget even about elections.
[00:20:24.790 --> 00:20:33.550]  It's pretty easy to see now the left-wing ideology and all of its overwhelming propaganda
[00:20:33.550 --> 00:20:43.830]  seeping into the consciousness, into the everyday life of the average American, is being rejected.
[00:20:43.830 --> 00:20:50.590]  And the far-left extremism, the weaponization of government, hell, just the blatant corruption
[00:20:50.590 --> 00:20:55.550]  of its political leaders.
[00:20:55.550 --> 00:21:02.550]  The American left is taking on water, if you want to use that analogy, or it's losing air,
[00:21:02.550 --> 00:21:05.270]  if you want to lose that analogy.
[00:21:05.270 --> 00:21:10.150]  It was always going to fail, it was always just going to be momentary, it was always
[00:21:10.150 --> 00:21:16.070]  just going to be a trend, but it's starting to be realized what it really represented,
[00:21:16.070 --> 00:21:18.110]  what was really behind it.
[00:21:18.110 --> 00:21:21.350]  And all these things they claim to represent and all these things they claim to be for,
[00:21:21.350 --> 00:21:23.350]  they never were.
[00:21:23.350 --> 00:21:32.390]  Anti-war, anti-racism, all this other garbage, anti-centralization, anti-big government.
[00:21:32.390 --> 00:21:34.590]  They're pro all of it.
[00:21:34.590 --> 00:21:37.790]  And so we see examples of this.
[00:21:37.790 --> 00:21:44.670]  First though, it's getting obvious, whether you like Donald Trump or not, that guy goes
[00:21:44.670 --> 00:21:49.870]  around, he's popular, he doesn't have to beg for cheers like Dr. Jill Biden.
[00:21:49.870 --> 00:21:56.350]  Dr. Jill channels Jeb Bush, awkwardly begs audience to clap, because you know, she's
[00:21:56.350 --> 00:21:57.350]  so popular.
[00:21:57.750 --> 00:22:01.830]  Joe Biden's America, price of ketchup, mustard, and relish skyrocket.
[00:22:01.830 --> 00:22:06.870]  Oh, your Memorial Day barbecue weekend probably doubled in price.
[00:22:06.870 --> 00:22:11.430]  I'm to the point now where it's like, I'm just praying that gas is less than $4 a gallon
[00:22:11.430 --> 00:22:12.430]  here in Austin, Texas.
[00:22:12.430 --> 00:22:13.430]  It's above that.
[00:22:13.430 --> 00:22:15.470]  It was, what, like $2 when Trump left?
[00:22:15.470 --> 00:22:16.470]  It was nice.
[00:22:16.470 --> 00:22:18.590]  You could fill your tank for like 40, 50 bucks.
[00:22:18.590 --> 00:22:20.230]  Not in Biden's America.
[00:22:20.230 --> 00:22:26.190]  Dianne Feinstein relies heavily on army of staffers, and includes Pelosi's daughter, bless
[00:22:26.190 --> 00:22:34.550]  her heart, although some believe that's because she's trying to win favor for Adam
[00:22:34.550 --> 00:22:37.950]  Schiff to take Feinstein's seat.
[00:22:37.950 --> 00:22:43.110]  Feinstein, Feinstein relies heavily on army of staffers to function, aides have to whisper
[00:22:43.110 --> 00:22:45.870]  in her ear between votes as if she has any idea.
[00:22:45.870 --> 00:22:51.830]  Oh, so you mean like Joe Biden, who can't wipe his own butt, or John Fetterman, who
[00:22:51.830 --> 00:22:57.550]  apparently is so depressed he can't even take a hoodie off, or his gym shorts off?
[00:22:57.550 --> 00:23:01.270]  Must be tough.
[00:23:01.270 --> 00:23:08.150]  And so that's why Tulsi Gabbard calls the Democrat Party an elitist cabal of warmongers.
[00:23:08.150 --> 00:23:10.670]  And it's starting to catch up to them, folks.
[00:23:10.670 --> 00:23:15.110]  AOC has an event in New York City this weekend.
[00:23:15.110 --> 00:23:20.590]  Many of her constituents show up and shout her down and protest her for supporting war.
[00:23:20.590 --> 00:23:26.390]  This is getting common now at leftist Democrat events, their constituents protesting them.
[00:23:26.390 --> 00:23:27.670]  You'll love to see it.
[00:23:27.670 --> 00:23:28.670]  Here it is.
[00:23:28.670 --> 00:23:58.190]  Yeah, get out.
[00:23:58.190 --> 00:24:00.990]  We don't like people that can think for themselves.
[00:24:00.990 --> 00:24:02.750]  We don't like people that are anti-war.
[00:24:02.750 --> 00:24:04.310]  We're the liberals now.
[00:24:04.310 --> 00:24:05.310]  We're pro-war.
[00:24:05.310 --> 00:24:11.790]  As long as we're the ones dropping the bombs and long as we're the ones doing the killing,
[00:24:11.790 --> 00:24:12.790]  it's OK.
[00:24:12.790 --> 00:24:19.270]  I'm a progressive liberal Democrat and I'm anti-war unless it's me doing the killing.
[00:24:19.270 --> 00:24:22.470]  Me doing the killing is a good thing.
[00:24:22.470 --> 00:24:25.110]  There's one lady sign that says AOC is a criminal.
[00:24:25.110 --> 00:24:28.790]  Here's a Cuban immigrant upset over the illegal immigrants draining into their city.
[00:24:28.790 --> 00:24:29.790]  Go ahead and pump the audio.
[00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:26.000]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, you're listening to The Alex Jones Show, and now
[00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:29.000]  your host, Owen Troyer.
[00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:36.000]  AOC not the only radical leftist, Marxist commie that's getting protested by our own
[00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:37.000]  constituents.
[00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:43.000]  Unfortunately for him and his security team, he hasn't really been able to walk the streets
[00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:46.000]  in public at all for years now.
[00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:49.000]  And now when he does public events, they have to shut down whole city blocks and make sure
[00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:50.000]  that he's isolated.
[00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:53.000]  This happened to Justin Trudeau over the weekend.
[00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:59.000]  He was just walking the sidewalks in Woodstock, Ontario, and it sounded like this.
[00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:10.000]  F*** you! F*** you! F*** you! F*** you! You f***ing piece of s***! F***ing pedophile!
[00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:20.000]  F*** you! F*** you! F*** you! F*** you! F*** you Trudeau!
[00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:31.000]  F*** you Trudeau! F*** you Trudeau! F*** you Trudeau! F*** you Trudeau! F*** you Trudeau!
[00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:36.000]  I think you can fill the blank for yourself there. Don't have to get too creative.
[00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:49.000]  You guys have been rude all day. F*** you! F*** you! F*** you! F*** you! F*** you! F*** you!
[00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:53.000]  Never liked you to begin with, a**hole! F*** you, buddy!
[00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:56.000]  What?
[00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:58.000]  No one likes him!
[00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:02.000]  They have no respect at all.
[00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:07.000]  Really? With pink hair? You're going to throw me like that?
[00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:09.000]  Yeah, let's do it.
[00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:15.000]  Please don't.
[00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:20.000]  Buddy, I need double time coming out for this crap.
[00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:22.000]  I love seeing you guys.
[00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:25.000]  You were probably there beating us in Ottawa too, weren't you?
[00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:27.000]  F***ing piece of s***!
[00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:29.000]  You probably liked it too, didn't you?
[00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:31.000]  You probably liked it, getting f***ing beaten.
[00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:33.000]  Wow, this is a jerk security guard.
[00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:35.000]  F***ing piece of s***, you know that?
[00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:41.000]  Celebrates beating Canadians and arresting them. He says it's good, it pays for his pool.
[00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:42.000]  What a jerk.
[00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:46.000]  To beat your f***ing citizens, and you're telling me you're happy that you did that?
[00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:50.000]  He is, he's got a nice pool. It's good to be a commie. You get rich.
[00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:52.000]  Took me in for laying on the ground.
[00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:56.000]  It's amazing how becoming a commie you usually become massively wealthy.
[00:35:56.000 --> 00:35:58.000]  And never share the wealth either.
[00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:01.000]  Who are you? What's your name?
[00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:02.000]  Isn't that something?
[00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:04.000]  Thanks, see you next time.
[00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:05.000]  That's something.
[00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:10.000]  All these modern day western commies, they sure get rich.
[00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:12.000]  They get filthy rich.
[00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:16.000]  And they never distribute the wealth.
[00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:18.000]  They always want to take your money though.
[00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:20.000]  They want to redistribute your money.
[00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:24.000]  Of course, that's just another word for steal, isn't it?
[00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:32.000]  It's starting to catch on, folks.
[00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:34.000]  It's starting to catch on.
[00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:39.000]  I mean, in a way, the American left has done this for themselves because
[00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:47.000]  they also have hyper-polarized things, but also made their voters hyper-aware.
[00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:51.000]  And for years, they've been looking around street corners for Nazis and white supremacists,
[00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:53.000]  and it's finally starting to catch up.
[00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:55.000]  You know, wait a second.
[00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:58.000]  You know, I'm not fine in Nazis, white supremacists.
[00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:00.000]  They're not really my problem, but you know,
[00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:03.000]  my energy bill is going up, and my grocery bill is going up,
[00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:05.000]  and gas prices keep going up,
[00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:08.000]  and gee, now they're starting a war and I'm supposed to pay for it?
[00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:10.000]  What the heck? What's going on here?
[00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:12.000]  All these people that were for the little guy,
[00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:15.000]  all these people that said they would redistribute the wealth,
[00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:18.000]  they keep getting richer, I keep getting poorer.
[00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:20.000]  What is going on here?
[00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:25.000]  Yeah, it's starting to catch on, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:27.000]  It's starting to catch on.
[00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:29.000]  And you know, something else that's starting to catch on,
[00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:31.000]  you've probably seen this going on, you've been aware of this,
[00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:36.000]  and that's the health revolution, taking back control of your health,
[00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:38.000]  whether that's just because you want to be as healthy as possible,
[00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:43.000]  or you've realized, I don't want to have to go to the hospital or go see a doctor.
[00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:47.000]  Those are like the last place you want to be right now.
[00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:50.000]  And so people are taking their health back into their own hands,
[00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:55.000]  and one of the ways we're trying to help with this effort is fill the voids.
[00:37:55.000 --> 00:38:00.000]  It's well known that many Americans are deficient in iodine.
[00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:04.000]  In fact, this has been a phenomenon for a long time, the iodine deficiency.
[00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:06.000]  Look it up for yourself.
[00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:12.000]  And so we try to give you a solution to that problem at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:20.000]  That solution is, of course, Survival Shield X3 activated nascent triiodine,

[00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:55.000]  in an activated triiodine formula to bring nascent iodine amplitude off the charts.
[00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:59.000]  Survival Shield X3 was manufactured in a state-licensed facility

[00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:05.000]  and affordable nascent iodine formula anywhere.

[00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:50.000]  All right, let's just cover some random headlines here
[00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:55.000]  before we really get focused on the other side of this break.
[00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:03.000]  It's really sick what's being done to the political prisoners,
[00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:06.000]  the politically persecuted in the United States of America
[00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:09.000]  by the American left, the Democrats.
[00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:11.000]  The story is at Gateway Pundit.
[00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:14.000]  Government is taking donations from January 6 prisoners
[00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:17.000]  so their families starve and they lose everything
[00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:19.000]  and so defendants cannot afford attorneys.
[00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:23.000]  Folks, these are oppressive communists.
[00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:25.000]  These are oppressive fascists.
[00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:28.000]  That's what this is. These are fascists.
[00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:33.000]  And the Associated Press is reporting this.
[00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:37.000]  Over 90% of the January 6 defendants are low to middle class
[00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:40.000]  and cannot afford private attorneys.
[00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:44.000]  And at least 80% of the FBI arrests were of protesters
[00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:48.000]  who were waived into the Capitol on January 6
[00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:50.000]  and committed no violence.
[00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:52.000]  And these fascists are sitting there trying to shut down
[00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:56.000]  their ability to fundraise, shut down their ability to get a lawyer,
[00:40:56.000 --> 00:40:59.000]  and shut down their ability to fight back against
[00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:02.000]  the corrupt government establishment.
[00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:04.000]  This is fascism. This is authoritarianism.
[00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:07.000]  This is oppression from the U.S. government.
[00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:08.000]  And it's really sad.
[00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:11.000]  We've never seen the U.S. government be weaponized
[00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:15.000]  by the American people so much as we are today.
[00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:20.000]  And the January 6 political prisoners and the politically persecuted
[00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:25.000]  are the case study that hopefully we will learn from
[00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:33.000]  and never engage in such tyranny against the American people ever again.
[00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:37.000]  Not enough of an issue raised on that.
[00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:40.000]  Meanwhile, though, they got plenty of help for the illegal immigrants.
[00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:42.000]  Those people get waived in and not charged.
[00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:44.000]  You get waived into the Capitol, you get charged.
[00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:47.000]  You get waived into the country, you get everything for free.
[00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:51.000]  Migrants allowed to enroll in Chicago schools without health records
[00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:54.000]  after years of draconian COVID rules.
[00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:59.000]  And they kept these COVID rules really up through this school year, folks,
[00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:01.000]  through this school year in Chicago,
[00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:03.000]  because those liberal teachers up there were lazy
[00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:04.000]  and didn't want to go back.
[00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:06.000]  But nonetheless, they did it anyway.
[00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:08.000]  But now illegal immigrants can walk right in
[00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:13.000]  and walk right into the classroom with no health records at all.
[00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:15.000]  Kind of like in Minnesota.
[00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:18.000]  They've got their little communist health care system up there,
[00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:21.000]  but it's only supposed to be for citizens of the state.
[00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:23.000]  Not anymore. Not anymore.
[00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:25.000]  The illegal immigrants are pouring in,
[00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:31.000]  and they're allowed to sign right up for that health care in Minnesota.
[00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:33.000]  Mm-mm-mm-mm-mm.
[00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:36.000]  And you're just supposed to take it,
[00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:38.000]  and you're just supposed to accept it.
[00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:43.000]  Your money getting stolen and given to non-citizens.
[00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:48.000]  The U.S. government persecuting innocent Americans
[00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:51.000]  that go against the Democrat establishment
[00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:54.000]  while they're letting in their replacement voter blocs
[00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:57.000]  at the southern border and now the northern border.
[00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:02.000]  Sold out for more than a year,

[00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:28.000]  There are no fillers in these products.

[00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:52.000]  I thank you for your support,

[00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:03.000]  Just weeks ago, I warned the world
[00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:05.000]  that the globalists were going to move against Tucker Carlson
[00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:06.000]  and take him off the air.
[00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:08.000]  People said, no way he's the most powerful thing that ever happened.
[00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:11.000]  They've got quadrillions of stolen money.
[00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:12.000]  They only had Tucker Carlson on the air
[00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:13.000]  because they believed they could control him.
[00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:15.000]  But as soon as they figured out they couldn't,
[00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:16.000]  he was taken off the air.
[00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:18.000]  It's the same thing with Infowars.
[00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:20.000]  But Infowars is not owned by Fox,
[00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:22.000]  or controlled by George Soros,
[00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:25.000]  or owned by Spotify like Joe Rogan.
[00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:28.000]  We are only beholden to our viewers and our listeners.
[00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:30.000]  And when you support us, we're unstoppable.
[00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:33.000]  I'm not underwritten by Rupert Murdoch,
[00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:35.000]  or by George Soros.
[00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:37.000]  I'm underwritten by you,
[00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:39.000]  which is we the people.
[00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:40.000]  So I want to thank you for your support
[00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:42.000]  and encourage viewers and listeners to understand,
[00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:44.000]  please don't take Infowars for granted.
[00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:46.000]  We're barely hanging on.
[00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:47.000]  We need your word of mouth,
[00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:49.000]  your prayer, and your financial support,

[00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:04.000]  joined by the one and only Greg Reis of the Reis Report.
[00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:07.000]  We wanted to hop on and send everybody to infowarsstore.com.

[00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:16.000]  or what Greg has.
[00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:17.000]  Greg, what do you got there?
[00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:19.000]  If you really want to treat yourself to something nice,
[00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:22.000]  get yourself an Alexa Pure water filter,
[00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:25.000]  and get clean, healthy water whenever you want it,
[00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:27.000]  wherever you want it.
[00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:29.000]  Even if the water pressure goes out,
[00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:33.000]  the gravity-fed water filter has got you covered.
[00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:34.000]  Absolutely.
[00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:39.000]  And we couldn't do any of this without listener support.
[00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:40.000]  I was telling Greg earlier,
[00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:42.000]  we're like the real NPR,
[00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:44.000]  the real NPR of the base, right?

[00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:53.000]  Support the Info War.
[00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:55.000]  Keep Alex, John Zarnschweier, Harrison Smith,
[00:45:55.000 --> 00:45:57.000]  Greg Reis, Adam King, and the rest of us on air.
[00:45:57.000 --> 00:45:58.000]  Do it today.
[00:45:58.000 --> 00:45:59.000]  Do it now.
[00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:00.000]  Support the Info War.
[00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:03.000]  There is a war for the future happening right now.
[00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:06.000]  There is a war that will control my destiny,
[00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:07.000]  your destiny,
[00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:08.000]  our children's destinies.
[00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:10.000]  And that war is something that we can win,
[00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:12.000]  but it takes dedication.
[00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:13.000]  It takes commitment.
[00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:15.000]  That's why I ask listeners respectfully
[00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:17.000]  to go to infowarsstore.com

[00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:28.000]  Take a signed or unsigned copy
[00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:29.000]  of my book,
[00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:30.000]  The Great Reset and War for the World,

[00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:32.000]  Back in Stock,

[00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:48.000]  You've been listening for years,
[00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:50.000]  but you've never taken the step
[00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:51.000]  to go to Info War Store.
[00:46:51.000 --> 00:46:53.000]  These are great products that really work
[00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:54.000]  and are amazing,
[00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:55.000]  plus they keep us on air.
[00:46:55.000 --> 00:46:57.000]  So again, please take action.
[00:46:57.000 --> 00:46:59.000]  Go to infowarsstore.com today,
[00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:00.000]  and I thank you.
[00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:02.000]  Leading a frontal assault
[00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:05.000]  on the lies of the New World Order,
[00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:07.000]  it's Alex Jones.
[00:47:08.700 --> 00:47:29.620]  Well, the coddling of Vladimir Zelensky in Ukraine by the U.S. media and our corrupt
[00:47:29.620 --> 00:47:37.700]  politicians continues to just get more disgusting, even with Hollywood losers going over there
[00:47:37.700 --> 00:47:46.620]  and glad-handing Zelensky, who really, if you look at this, has been probably the worst
[00:47:46.620 --> 00:47:49.779]  leader in the history of Ukraine.
[00:47:49.779 --> 00:47:55.500]  Has there ever been more bloodshed and suffering and destruction in Ukraine?
[00:47:55.500 --> 00:48:01.740]  More so than during Zelensky's time as president?
[00:48:02.740 --> 00:48:07.740]  It's actually disgusting, the people supporting this.
[00:48:07.740 --> 00:48:12.740]  It's actually disgusting, the people claiming there's been any victories for Ukraine in this.
[00:48:12.740 --> 00:48:14.740]  It's sick.
[00:48:14.740 --> 00:48:21.740]  But this might be maybe the most disgusting thing you've ever heard said about it from
[00:48:21.740 --> 00:48:22.740]  a U.S. politician.
[00:48:22.740 --> 00:48:24.740]  It's Lindsey Graham.
[00:48:24.740 --> 00:48:26.740]  This man is truly disgusting.
[00:48:26.740 --> 00:48:28.740]  This man is deranged.
[00:48:28.740 --> 00:48:32.740]  Sounds like a psycho killer here in Clip 12.
[00:48:32.740 --> 00:48:34.740]  Free or die.
[00:48:34.740 --> 00:48:35.740]  Free or die.
[00:48:35.740 --> 00:48:36.740]  Now you are free.
[00:48:36.740 --> 00:48:37.740]  Yes.
[00:48:37.740 --> 00:48:38.740]  And we will be.
[00:48:38.740 --> 00:48:39.740]  And the Russians are dying.
[00:48:39.740 --> 00:48:42.740]  It's the best money we've ever spent.
[00:48:42.740 --> 00:48:43.740]  Thank you so much.
[00:48:43.740 --> 00:48:44.740]  Now listen.
[00:48:46.740 --> 00:48:48.740]  And now the Russians are dying.
[00:48:48.740 --> 00:48:51.740]  It's the best money we've ever spent.
[00:48:51.740 --> 00:48:57.740]  To the Russians out there, I apologize for Lindsey Graham being a warmongering piece of shit.
[00:48:57.740 --> 00:48:58.740]  I apologize.
[00:48:58.740 --> 00:49:02.740]  And he's one of many in the U.S. government that we should all apologize for.
[00:49:02.740 --> 00:49:11.740]  We should as a nation be apologizing for the sick warmongering that comes out of D.C.
[00:49:13.740 --> 00:49:20.740]  The whole world has sat here and watched us allow these warmongers like Lindsey Graham
[00:49:20.740 --> 00:49:25.740]  to blow up foreign countries, run coups in foreign elections,
[00:49:25.740 --> 00:49:30.740]  and now Lindsey Graham, because that little pussy has never been put in his place,
[00:49:30.740 --> 00:49:34.740]  sits there next to Zelensky like a tough guy and says,
[00:49:34.740 --> 00:49:37.740]  We've killed Russians. Best money we've ever spent.
[00:49:37.740 --> 00:49:40.740]  Why don't you go over there and fight Russians, Lindsey?
[00:49:41.740 --> 00:49:43.740]  You little bitch.
[00:49:44.740 --> 00:49:48.740]  Lindsey's never seen a war that he didn't want someone else to die in.
[00:49:48.740 --> 00:49:52.740]  How much stock do you think Lindsey Graham has in Lockheed Martin and Raytheon
[00:49:52.740 --> 00:49:55.740]  and other weapons contractors and manufacturers?
[00:49:55.740 --> 00:49:58.740]  I'd like to know. Would you?
[00:49:59.740 --> 00:50:02.740]  Why is Lindsey Graham celebrating dead Russians?
[00:50:02.740 --> 00:50:09.740]  By the way, it's probably about four times as many Ukrainians that have died as Russians.
[00:50:09.740 --> 00:50:13.740]  Is that good to Lindsey Graham?
[00:50:13.740 --> 00:50:15.740]  Is that a good number?
[00:50:15.740 --> 00:50:19.740]  How many Ukrainians have to die for Lindsey Graham to sit across that table from Zelensky
[00:50:19.740 --> 00:50:21.740]  and have a shit-eating grin on his face?
[00:50:21.740 --> 00:50:23.740]  I'm sorry, I've cussed too many times, we're probably out of dump.
[00:50:23.740 --> 00:50:32.740]  But hey, Lindsey Graham is pleased that people are dying in Ukraine.
[00:50:32.740 --> 00:50:37.740]  He doesn't care. It's the best money that we've ever spent, says Lindsey Graham.
[00:50:39.740 --> 00:50:46.740]  That is mad, evil, villain, genocidal rhetoric.
[00:50:47.740 --> 00:50:50.740]  With a smile on his face.
[00:50:52.740 --> 00:50:54.740]  It's embarrassing.
[00:50:55.740 --> 00:51:01.740]  Congress to investigate World Health Organization plans to use listening surveillance systems
[00:51:01.740 --> 00:51:03.740]  to identify misinformation.
[00:51:03.740 --> 00:51:09.740]  Oh yes, but remember Joe Biden wants to sign over our sovereignty to the World Health Organization.
[00:51:09.740 --> 00:51:12.740]  So of course they should be allowed to spy on you.
[00:51:13.740 --> 00:51:16.740]  I mean, golly gee, the serpent.
[00:51:17.740 --> 00:51:21.740]  The World Health Organization serpent over the flat earth?
[00:51:21.740 --> 00:51:22.740]  What are they, flat earthers too?
[00:51:22.740 --> 00:51:24.740]  What kind of propaganda is this?
[00:51:25.740 --> 00:51:30.740]  The evil on earth, the World Health Organization, big pharmaceutical companies.
[00:51:31.740 --> 00:51:33.740]  Why would they need to listen to you?
[00:51:34.740 --> 00:51:39.740]  Because it's not about health, it's about dominance and control.
[00:51:39.740 --> 00:51:44.740]  COVID style lockdowns to be imposed by UK, by World Health Organization under new treaty.
[00:51:44.740 --> 00:51:46.740]  Same thing they want to do here.
[00:51:46.740 --> 00:51:49.740]  At least some resistance is coming from Congress.
[00:51:50.740 --> 00:51:52.740]  But what's really going on in Ukraine?
[00:51:54.740 --> 00:51:55.740]  What's Russia up to?
[00:51:55.740 --> 00:52:01.740]  Avian flu pathogens with 40% kill rate in humans found at US biolab in Ukraine.
[00:52:02.740 --> 00:52:04.740]  According to the Russian government,
[00:52:05.740 --> 00:52:10.740]  Russia has accused the United States of experimenting with avian flu pathogens
[00:52:10.740 --> 00:52:14.740]  at a US biolab in Ukraine with up to 40% lethality rate in humans.
[00:52:14.740 --> 00:52:17.740]  The Russian Ministry of Defense released a statement on Friday
[00:52:17.740 --> 00:52:23.740]  claiming it has recovered deadly samples of avian flu virus strains
[00:52:23.740 --> 00:52:29.740]  with high potential for epidemic spread at a US biolab in the Kursan region of Ukraine.
[00:52:31.740 --> 00:52:35.740]  Oh, is that why Kursan was such an important region for Ukraine to defend?
[00:52:35.740 --> 00:52:36.740]  And then they lost it?
[00:52:36.740 --> 00:52:38.740]  And now the biolabs have been found?
[00:52:38.740 --> 00:52:40.740]  Which Victoria Nuland confirmed.
[00:52:41.740 --> 00:52:44.740]  First denied, but then we found their online documents that were public
[00:52:44.740 --> 00:52:45.740]  and then they had to admit it.
[00:52:45.740 --> 00:52:47.740]  Oh wait, we do have the biolabs there.
[00:52:47.740 --> 00:52:48.740]  It was all public.
[00:52:49.740 --> 00:52:51.740]  Kind of like Joe Biden at the Council on Foreign Relations.
[00:52:51.740 --> 00:52:55.740]  Hell yeah, I bribed Ukraine to fire the investigator investigating my son.
[00:52:57.740 --> 00:53:00.740]  And then of course they've put this out with the evidence.
[00:53:02.740 --> 00:53:03.740]  Russia that is.
[00:53:04.740 --> 00:53:06.740]  Read in full briefing by
[00:53:08.740 --> 00:53:12.740]  the Russian Ministry of Defense on US military biological activity.
[00:53:12.740 --> 00:53:15.740]  Evidence of the research of dangerous pathogens in Ukraine.
[00:53:15.740 --> 00:53:18.740]  Development of biological weapons by the United States.
[00:53:18.740 --> 00:53:22.740]  Establishment of BSL-4 biolabs abroad by the United States.
[00:53:22.740 --> 00:53:25.740]  All of it is real, whether you love or hate Russia.
[00:53:25.740 --> 00:53:27.740]  Whatever you feel about this war, it's all real.
[00:53:28.740 --> 00:53:31.740]  It's in the US State Department documents, folks.
[00:53:31.740 --> 00:53:33.740]  This isn't Russian propaganda.
[00:53:34.740 --> 00:53:37.740]  The State Department had this information public.
[00:53:38.740 --> 00:53:40.740]  They bragged about these biolabs.
[00:53:40.740 --> 00:53:43.740]  They bragged about the military biological weapons labs in Ukraine.
[00:53:43.740 --> 00:53:44.740]  It's no secret.
[00:53:44.740 --> 00:53:47.740]  And it's directly connected to the
[00:53:48.740 --> 00:53:49.740]  drumroll
[00:53:50.740 --> 00:53:52.740]  Biden crime family.
[00:53:54.740 --> 00:53:55.740]  With Hunter Biden
[00:53:56.740 --> 00:53:59.740]  and his international business dealings.
[00:54:01.740 --> 00:54:03.740]  Where, by the way, there's a major
[00:54:04.740 --> 00:54:06.740]  call it a Cold War happening
[00:54:06.740 --> 00:54:08.740]  inside the federal government
[00:54:08.740 --> 00:54:10.740]  with FBI whistleblowers
[00:54:10.740 --> 00:54:13.740]  who have seen the Biden crime family documents
[00:54:13.740 --> 00:54:15.740]  and are aghast,
[00:54:15.740 --> 00:54:16.740]  stunned,
[00:54:17.740 --> 00:54:18.740]  stunned
[00:54:19.740 --> 00:54:23.740]  that Christopher Wray and Merrick Garland have taken no action.
[00:54:24.740 --> 00:54:26.740]  And you got to understand,
[00:54:26.740 --> 00:54:28.740]  these are people that sat there and watched
[00:54:28.740 --> 00:54:32.740]  the criminal persecution of Donald Trump for years with no evidence
[00:54:32.740 --> 00:54:35.740]  and perhaps said nothing because they didn't want to ruffle feathers.
[00:54:35.740 --> 00:54:37.740]  Well, now there's actual evidence of crimes.
[00:54:39.740 --> 00:54:42.740]  And it's Joe Biden and Garland
[00:54:42.740 --> 00:54:45.740]  and Wray are making sure to cover it up.
[00:54:46.740 --> 00:54:50.740]  Making sure nothing happens, just like they did for Hillary Clinton.
[00:54:50.740 --> 00:54:53.740]  And, of course, there's the Barack Obama angle of all of this
[00:54:53.740 --> 00:54:55.740]  because his fingerprints are over
[00:54:55.740 --> 00:54:57.740]  all over
[00:54:57.740 --> 00:54:59.740]  the Russian collusion hoax
[00:54:59.740 --> 00:55:00.740]  as well.
[00:55:02.740 --> 00:55:03.740]  But getting back to the issue.
[00:55:03.740 --> 00:55:04.740]  So why
[00:55:05.740 --> 00:55:08.740]  is the World Health Organization warning of a
[00:55:09.740 --> 00:55:12.740]  biological outbreak, another pandemic?
[00:55:13.740 --> 00:55:14.740]  And I would say
[00:55:15.740 --> 00:55:18.740]  if there's a window of opportunity for the globalists,
[00:55:18.740 --> 00:55:21.740]  if there's a window of opportunity for the deep state,
[00:55:21.740 --> 00:55:23.740]  they're going to feel they're in it right now
[00:55:23.740 --> 00:55:24.740]  and
[00:55:25.740 --> 00:55:26.740]  they'll blame Russia
[00:55:27.740 --> 00:55:29.740]  if there's any sort of
[00:55:29.740 --> 00:55:32.740]  biological release or new pandemic.
[00:55:32.740 --> 00:55:33.740]  Now, here's the problem.
[00:55:35.740 --> 00:55:38.740]  Now, they might not care because they assume the American people are so stupid
[00:55:38.740 --> 00:55:39.740]  they can't put two and two together.
[00:55:42.030 --> 00:55:45.030]  But how are they going to get around that now?
[00:55:45.030 --> 00:55:48.030]  If there's another biological release, another pandemic,
[00:55:48.030 --> 00:55:52.030]  while denying that they had any of the labs in Ukraine,
[00:55:52.030 --> 00:55:54.030]  because that's going to be what they say.
[00:55:54.030 --> 00:55:57.030]  They're going to say Russia went into the labs in Ukraine that we didn't have,
[00:55:57.030 --> 00:55:59.030]  and they blew them up, and they blew up the containment,
[00:55:59.030 --> 00:56:01.030]  and the viruses got out because of Russia.
[00:56:01.030 --> 00:56:05.030]  But also, those labs didn't exist, and we had nothing to do with those labs.
[00:56:05.030 --> 00:56:08.030]  Those were not our biological weapons labs,
[00:56:08.030 --> 00:56:11.030]  but Russia also went into our biological weapons labs,
[00:56:11.030 --> 00:56:15.030]  blew them up, and spread a virus, but they don't exist.
[00:56:15.030 --> 00:56:19.030]  Now, of course, they would run with that propaganda,
[00:56:19.030 --> 00:56:26.030]  but let's just keep our eyes peeled for that.
[00:56:26.030 --> 00:56:30.030]  So Russia could have either stopped the next biological release,
[00:56:30.030 --> 00:56:33.030]  or they're going to release it and blame Russia.
[00:56:33.030 --> 00:56:35.030]  But of course, this is all to do what?
[00:56:35.030 --> 00:56:38.030]  Put you into fear, and then put you into control,
[00:56:38.030 --> 00:56:43.030]  and then give you the vaccine that, well, doesn't work so well.
[00:56:43.030 --> 00:56:45.030]  Maybe it had something to do with this.
[00:56:45.030 --> 00:56:49.030]  LSU's Samaya Smith faints during White House visit with Biden,
[00:56:49.030 --> 00:56:53.030]  took her six minutes to recover and get her out of there in a wheelchair.
[00:56:53.030 --> 00:56:57.030]  They say she'll be fine. What happened to her?
[00:56:57.030 --> 00:57:01.030]  Teen dies after medical emergency during swim meet.
[00:57:01.030 --> 00:57:04.030]  Just days from big accomplishment, and so the story continues.
[00:57:04.030 --> 00:57:09.030]  Like you've never seen it before, young athletes,
[00:57:09.030 --> 00:57:18.030]  young athletes just dropping dead out of nowhere.
[00:57:18.030 --> 00:57:22.030]  It's all over the place.
[00:57:22.030 --> 00:57:24.030]  Been covering it for years, unfortunately,
[00:57:24.030 --> 00:57:30.030]  and it all started happening coincidentally after the COVID-19 vaccine.
[00:57:30.030 --> 00:57:32.030]  But don't you dare suggest that,
[00:57:32.030 --> 00:57:34.030]  and don't you dare go to the VAERS reporting website
[00:57:34.030 --> 00:57:38.030]  that shows that the COVID-19 vaccine is the deadliest vaccine in U.S. history,
[00:57:38.030 --> 00:57:41.030]  and by the way, it's not even close.
[00:57:41.030 --> 00:57:43.030]  It's the Michael Jordan of deadly vaccines.
[00:57:43.030 --> 00:57:49.030]  It's the Babe Ruth of deadly vaccines, and they forced you to take it.
[00:57:49.030 --> 00:57:53.030]  In the early 1900s, certain companies were off-gassing
[00:57:53.030 --> 00:57:57.030]  highly toxic fluoride gases into the atmosphere.
[00:57:57.030 --> 00:58:00.030]  The surrounding communities began to get sick.
[00:58:00.030 --> 00:58:05.030]  Laws were enacted to compel these corporations to install scrubbers
[00:58:05.030 --> 00:58:08.030]  to convert these gases into fluorosilicic acid,
[00:58:08.030 --> 00:58:11.030]  still highly toxic but containable.
[00:58:11.030 --> 00:58:14.030]  Now these companies had a stockpile of this poison,
[00:58:14.030 --> 00:58:17.030]  and there was no affordable way to dispose of it.
[00:58:17.030 --> 00:58:19.030]  Lucky for them, one of their major stockholders
[00:58:19.030 --> 00:58:22.030]  was also the Secretary of the Treasury,
[00:58:22.030 --> 00:58:25.030]  who was responsible for the public health service at the time.
[00:58:25.030 --> 00:58:29.030]  Then by 1950, the U.S. government began buying this toxic,
[00:58:29.030 --> 00:58:34.030]  untreated industrial waste product and dumping it into our drinking water.
[00:58:34.030 --> 00:58:39.030]  Reputable studies show that it's causing various cancers and other disease.
[00:58:39.030 --> 00:58:43.030]  With the Alexa Pure Pro, you can have clean drinking water
[00:58:43.030 --> 00:58:45.030]  and a remedy to this madness.
[00:58:45.030 --> 00:58:49.030]  Available now at infowarstore.com.
[00:58:49.030 --> 00:58:55.030]  Hydrofluorosilicic acid is the third most deadly acid on Earth,
[00:58:55.030 --> 00:58:58.030]  and they've got our children drinking that.
[00:58:58.030 --> 00:59:02.030]  This is a psychotic death cult, period, case closed,
[00:59:02.030 --> 00:59:04.030]  out to get you and your family.
[00:59:04.030 --> 00:59:06.030]  We sell the Alexa Pure Breeze,
[00:59:06.030 --> 00:59:09.030]  made by the My Patriot Supply Ready Hour Group.
[00:59:09.030 --> 00:59:12.030]  It's been around about 15 years, became the biggest company in the last six.
[00:59:12.030 --> 00:59:15.030]  They went out, hired engineers, reverse engineered the fancy
[00:59:15.030 --> 00:59:18.030]  best water filter system out there that sells for twice the price,
[00:59:18.030 --> 00:59:21.030]  and they made it as good in all the studies.
[00:59:21.030 --> 00:59:24.030]  It reduces things to non-detectable levels, thousands of chemicals.
[00:59:24.030 --> 00:59:26.030]  But you can go pay two or three times.
[00:59:26.030 --> 00:59:29.030]  There's four or five other filters out there that are just as good.
[00:59:29.030 --> 00:59:32.030]  We sell the very best, highest-grade water filtration system
[00:59:32.030 --> 00:59:34.030]  for half the price of the leading competitor.
[00:59:34.030 --> 00:59:39.030]  And the media says we're bad and a cult for telling you you should filter your water.
[00:59:39.030 --> 00:59:41.030]  You should also filter your shower water.
[00:59:41.030 --> 00:59:43.030]  That's another way you absorb this crap.
[00:59:43.030 --> 00:59:45.030]  But I'm done talking about that.
[00:59:45.030 --> 00:59:47.030]  The point is you can get the filters at infowarstore.com.
[00:59:47.030 --> 00:59:48.030]  They're discounted right now.
[00:59:48.030 --> 00:59:49.030]  Finally back in stock.
[00:59:51.030 --> 00:59:55.030]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order,
[00:59:55.030 --> 00:59:57.030]  it's Alex Jones.
[01:00:07.030 --> 01:00:11.030]  This is all part of what the globalists call the managed decline of the West,
[01:00:11.030 --> 01:00:15.030]  but really it's a managed decline of the entire world.
[01:00:15.030 --> 01:00:18.030]  WOKE is supposed to advance equity in Europe.
[01:00:18.030 --> 01:00:21.030]  The definition of equity comes from the public administration literature.
[01:00:21.030 --> 01:00:24.030]  It was written by a man named George Fredrickson.
[01:00:24.030 --> 01:00:27.030]  And the definition is an administered political economy
[01:00:27.030 --> 01:00:32.030]  in which shares are adjusted so that citizens are made equal.
[01:00:32.030 --> 01:00:37.030]  They're going to administer an economy to make shares equal.
[01:00:37.030 --> 01:00:40.030]  The only difference between equity and socialism
[01:00:40.030 --> 01:00:43.030]  is the type of property that they redistribute,
[01:00:43.030 --> 01:00:45.030]  the type of shares.
[01:00:45.030 --> 01:00:49.030]  They're going to redistribute social and cultural capital
[01:00:49.030 --> 01:00:52.030]  in addition to economic and material capital.
[01:00:52.030 --> 01:00:54.030]  Well, behaviors are going to have to change,
[01:00:54.030 --> 01:00:56.030]  and this is one thing we're asking companies.
[01:00:56.030 --> 01:00:59.030]  You have to force behaviors.
[01:00:59.030 --> 01:01:02.030]  At BlackRock, we are forcing behaviors.
[01:01:02.030 --> 01:01:04.030]  And so this is my thesis.
[01:01:04.030 --> 01:01:06.030]  When we say, what is WOKE?
[01:01:06.030 --> 01:01:11.030]  WOKE is Maoism with American characteristics,
[01:01:11.030 --> 01:01:13.030]  if I might borrow from Mao himself,
[01:01:13.030 --> 01:01:15.030]  who said that his philosophy
[01:01:15.030 --> 01:01:18.030]  was Marxism-Leninism with Chinese characteristics,
[01:01:18.030 --> 01:01:21.030]  which means WOKE is Marxism.
[01:01:21.030 --> 01:01:23.030]  Henry Kissinger attributed to a book
[01:01:23.030 --> 01:01:25.030]  with the head of the Kissinger group, Rothkopf,
[01:01:25.030 --> 01:01:27.030]  now about 15 years ago, called Superclass.
[01:01:27.030 --> 01:01:31.030]  They say it's about 3,000 people worldwide
[01:01:31.030 --> 01:01:34.030]  that are the main manager class that run it all.
[01:01:34.030 --> 01:01:37.030]  This is a totalitarian, transhumanist death cult.
[01:01:37.030 --> 01:01:41.030]  The biggest question maybe in economics and politics
[01:01:41.030 --> 01:01:43.030]  of the coming decades will be
[01:01:43.030 --> 01:01:46.030]  what to do with all these useless people.
[01:01:46.030 --> 01:01:49.030]  It is an extension of the North American
[01:01:49.030 --> 01:01:51.030]  man-boy love association
[01:01:51.030 --> 01:01:55.030]  who think that grown men should be able to have sex
[01:01:55.030 --> 01:01:57.030]  with your little boys.
[01:01:57.030 --> 01:01:59.030]  That's what's going on here.
[01:01:59.030 --> 01:02:03.030]  These big companies have no right to tell us what to do,
[01:02:03.030 --> 01:02:05.030]  and I think we as legislators need to think about it,
[01:02:05.030 --> 01:02:07.030]  who we're representing,
[01:02:07.030 --> 01:02:10.030]  because these agencies do not represent with the people.
[01:02:10.030 --> 01:02:12.030]  They represent big special interest groups.
[01:02:12.030 --> 01:02:14.030]  People rotate between them.
[01:02:14.030 --> 01:02:16.030]  They're getting jobs and lobbying and careers
[01:02:16.030 --> 01:02:18.030]  in all of these different companies,
[01:02:18.030 --> 01:02:20.030]  and they're promulgating these rules
[01:02:20.030 --> 01:02:23.030]  to benefit large special interest groups.
[01:02:23.030 --> 01:02:25.030]  And now they are becoming so powerful
[01:02:25.030 --> 01:02:28.030]  that everyone is afraid to challenge them.
[01:02:28.030 --> 01:02:32.030]  So our branch has to get our act together
[01:02:32.030 --> 01:02:34.030]  and start doing our job
[01:02:34.030 --> 01:02:38.030]  and not be afraid of administrative state,
[01:02:38.030 --> 01:02:41.030]  not be afraid of large corporations
[01:02:41.030 --> 01:02:44.030]  and big money that's coming from all directions.
[01:02:44.030 --> 01:02:48.030]  But we actually remember that this republic
[01:02:48.030 --> 01:02:50.030]  is set up in being the greatest republic
[01:02:50.030 --> 01:02:52.030]  in the history of the world for all the reasons.
[01:02:52.030 --> 01:02:54.030]  There is no difference between the people
[01:02:54.030 --> 01:02:58.030]  because the people have the most power and freedoms,
[01:02:58.030 --> 01:03:01.030]  and if we take these freedoms away from the people,
[01:03:01.030 --> 01:03:04.030]  we are going to unfortunately abandon
[01:03:04.030 --> 01:03:06.030]  and betray all the people who die for our freedoms.
[01:03:06.030 --> 01:03:07.030]  I yield back.
[01:03:07.030 --> 01:03:10.030]  The reason humanity is in so much trouble
[01:03:10.030 --> 01:03:12.030]  is because we will not admit to ourselves
[01:03:12.030 --> 01:03:14.030]  that true evil exists,
[01:03:14.030 --> 01:03:16.030]  and when methodologies of total evil and corruption
[01:03:16.030 --> 01:03:18.030]  are being carried out against us,
[01:03:18.030 --> 01:03:20.030]  we will not come to grips with the fact
[01:03:20.030 --> 01:03:25.030]  that we are truly facing absolute, pure, total corruption.
[01:03:25.030 --> 01:03:29.030]  The FBI interfered in the 2016 election,
[01:03:29.030 --> 01:03:32.030]  and then when they failed to get their candidate elected,
[01:03:32.030 --> 01:03:33.030]  Hillary Clinton,
[01:03:33.030 --> 01:03:35.030]  then they just set out to destroy the Trump administration.
[01:03:35.030 --> 01:03:38.030]  So then go back and go up to 2020.
[01:03:38.030 --> 01:03:41.030]  It was the CIA this time that got involved
[01:03:41.030 --> 01:03:45.030]  in the 2020 election with those 51 former intel agents
[01:03:45.030 --> 01:03:47.030]  who talked about the Hunter Biden laptop
[01:03:47.030 --> 01:03:49.030]  as total Russian disinformation.
[01:03:49.030 --> 01:03:51.030]  So they've gotten away with it for two elections.
[01:03:51.030 --> 01:03:53.030]  They're for sure going to get away with it,
[01:03:53.030 --> 01:03:55.030]  try to get away with it in 24, right?
[01:03:55.030 --> 01:03:57.030]  Because there's no consequence.
[01:03:57.030 --> 01:04:00.030]  The difference is in 2024, the evidence is there.
[01:04:00.030 --> 01:04:02.030]  We now have the Durham investigation.
[01:04:02.030 --> 01:04:04.030]  We have all the congressional investigations.
[01:04:04.030 --> 01:04:06.030]  There is now hard evidence
[01:04:06.030 --> 01:04:07.030]  that there was election interference
[01:04:07.030 --> 01:04:09.030]  by the U.S. intelligence agencies
[01:04:09.030 --> 01:04:11.030]  and the Department of Justice.
[01:04:11.030 --> 01:04:12.030]  They've got to be terrified.
[01:04:12.030 --> 01:04:14.030]  Those individuals have to be terrified
[01:04:14.030 --> 01:04:16.030]  that a Republican president comes in
[01:04:16.030 --> 01:04:18.030]  in the 2024 election
[01:04:18.030 --> 01:04:20.030]  with a Republican attorney general,
[01:04:20.030 --> 01:04:21.030]  investigates them,
[01:04:21.030 --> 01:04:23.030]  and charges them all with the crimes
[01:04:23.030 --> 01:04:25.030]  they've committed over the last eight years.
[01:04:25.030 --> 01:04:29.030]  Then you study the Bible and history and our enemies,
[01:04:29.030 --> 01:04:33.030]  and they are a consortium of people
[01:04:33.030 --> 01:04:37.030]  following what can only be called satanic principles.
[01:04:37.030 --> 01:04:40.030]  Hey, do you guys support the satanic pride propaganda?
[01:04:40.030 --> 01:04:42.030]  I, yeah, both.
[01:04:42.030 --> 01:04:43.030]  You support it?
[01:04:43.030 --> 01:04:44.030]  Satan and pride.
[01:04:44.030 --> 01:04:45.030]  You support Satan?
[01:04:45.030 --> 01:04:46.030]  Mm-hmm.
[01:04:46.030 --> 01:04:47.030]  What's God going to think of that?
[01:04:47.030 --> 01:04:48.030]  I don't believe in God.
[01:04:48.030 --> 01:04:49.030]  Is that bad?
[01:04:49.030 --> 01:04:51.030]  You guys are satanic.
[01:04:51.030 --> 01:04:52.030]  True.
[01:04:52.030 --> 01:04:54.030]  See, open satanic,
[01:04:54.030 --> 01:04:55.030]  open satanist, guys,
[01:04:55.030 --> 01:04:56.030]  that's what we're going to get up against,
[01:04:56.030 --> 01:04:58.030]  is open satanists like they're...
[01:05:00.030 --> 01:05:02.030]  Thousands of former Nazis
[01:05:02.030 --> 01:05:04.030]  went to work for the United States government.
[01:05:04.030 --> 01:05:06.030]  A flying disc has been found
[01:05:06.030 --> 01:05:08.030]  and is now in the possession of the army.
[01:05:08.030 --> 01:05:10.030]  Here is a bulletin from CBS News.
[01:05:10.030 --> 01:05:13.030]  President Kennedy has been shot.
[01:05:13.030 --> 01:05:16.030]  This is a different kind of war.
[01:05:16.030 --> 01:05:18.030]  The USS Liberty had just been attacked
[01:05:18.030 --> 01:05:20.030]  by Israeli jets and torpedo boats.
[01:05:21.030 --> 01:05:24.030]  A CIA could manipulate the news in the United States.
[01:05:24.030 --> 01:05:26.030]  They took the babies out of incubators
[01:05:26.030 --> 01:05:28.030]  and left the children to die on the cold floor.
[01:05:28.030 --> 01:05:31.030]  It was almost as if there were a plan in motion.
[01:05:31.030 --> 01:05:32.030]  It just happened.
[01:05:32.030 --> 01:05:34.030]  We need to go into the Capitol.
[01:05:34.030 --> 01:05:36.030]  That does not...
[01:05:36.030 --> 01:05:38.030]  You will always have conspiracy theories.
[01:05:38.030 --> 01:05:40.030]  They are nothing but distractions.
[01:05:40.030 --> 01:05:42.030]  You guys censored Harvard-educated doctors.
[01:05:42.030 --> 01:05:44.030]  You silenced those voices.
[01:05:44.030 --> 01:05:46.030]  What we want to do in Davos
[01:05:46.030 --> 01:05:48.030]  is push the reset button.
[01:05:48.030 --> 01:05:51.030]  As soon as we start exposing the great reset,
[01:05:51.030 --> 01:05:53.030]  as soon as these globalists
[01:05:53.030 --> 01:05:55.030]  start going to prison...
[01:06:01.030 --> 01:06:03.030]  We now take you live
[01:06:03.030 --> 01:06:05.030]  to the Central Texas Manslaughter
[01:06:05.030 --> 01:06:07.030]  and the heart of the resistance.
[01:06:07.030 --> 01:06:10.030]  And now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[01:06:18.030 --> 01:06:19.030]  Sunday!
[01:06:21.030 --> 01:06:22.030]  Sunday!
[01:06:25.030 --> 01:06:26.030]  Sunday!
[01:06:28.030 --> 01:06:30.030]  All right, so here's the deal.
[01:06:31.030 --> 01:06:35.030]  If you're not totally in,
[01:06:35.030 --> 01:06:37.030]  totally bought in
[01:06:37.030 --> 01:06:40.030]  on the radical left ideology and culture,
[01:06:40.030 --> 01:06:43.030]  then they put you on a terror watch list.
[01:06:43.030 --> 01:06:46.030]  It's funny that all these leftists out there,
[01:06:46.030 --> 01:06:48.030]  they think they're anti-establishment.
[01:06:48.030 --> 01:06:50.030]  No, you are literally the foot soldiers
[01:06:50.030 --> 01:06:52.030]  for the establishment.
[01:06:52.030 --> 01:06:56.030]  You are the equivalent of the Nazi Youth Brigade.
[01:06:56.030 --> 01:06:57.030]  The brown shirts.
[01:06:57.030 --> 01:06:59.030]  That's you guys.
[01:07:00.030 --> 01:07:01.030]  It's amazing you haven't figured that out yet.
[01:07:01.030 --> 01:07:02.030]  Or have they?
[01:07:02.030 --> 01:07:04.030]  And they've just embraced the role as the bad guys.
[01:07:04.030 --> 01:07:05.030]  And so now,
[01:07:06.030 --> 01:07:08.030]  the federal government's pyramid
[01:07:08.030 --> 01:07:10.030]  of far-right radicalization,
[01:07:10.030 --> 01:07:12.030]  which is ironic enough,
[01:07:13.030 --> 01:07:16.030]  actually at the top of it is socialism.
[01:07:16.030 --> 01:07:18.030]  So since when is socialism a right-wing idea?
[01:07:18.030 --> 01:07:20.030]  I thought that was a left-wing idea
[01:07:20.030 --> 01:07:22.030]  with all the Nazi symbolism
[01:07:22.030 --> 01:07:25.030]  and all the socialism symbols there.
[01:07:25.030 --> 01:07:26.030]  So it's funny,
[01:07:26.030 --> 01:07:28.030]  at the top of the far-right pyramid
[01:07:28.030 --> 01:07:31.030]  is actually far-leftism.
[01:07:31.030 --> 01:07:34.030]  Far-left policies like socialism.
[01:07:34.030 --> 01:07:36.030]  So that's ironic.
[01:07:36.030 --> 01:07:38.030]  But they have the Infowars logo right on there,
[01:07:38.030 --> 01:07:41.030]  as well as Breitbart and PragerU and others.
[01:07:42.030 --> 01:07:43.030]  Oh my gosh.
[01:07:45.030 --> 01:07:47.030]  Yeah, you're the anti-establishment.
[01:07:47.030 --> 01:07:50.030]  You literally do the bidding of the federal government
[01:07:50.030 --> 01:07:54.030]  that has declared war on how many nations,
[01:07:54.030 --> 01:07:56.030]  or didn't declare war on how many nations,
[01:07:56.030 --> 01:07:58.030]  or ran how many coups in foreign nations.
[01:07:58.030 --> 01:08:00.030]  You don't even know.
[01:08:00.030 --> 01:08:04.030]  And they get 80 grants and $40 million taxpayer dollars
[01:08:04.030 --> 01:08:07.030]  to target conservatives, target right-wingers.
[01:08:08.030 --> 01:08:09.030]  But who is it really?
[01:08:09.030 --> 01:08:11.030]  It really is now the anti-establishment.
[01:08:12.030 --> 01:08:14.030]  Coined right here by Infowars.
[01:08:14.030 --> 01:08:16.030]  Conservatism is counter-culture.
[01:08:16.030 --> 01:08:19.030]  Well, that's why they're coming after all the conservatives now.
[01:08:21.030 --> 01:08:25.030]  But the culture wars are truly on.
[01:08:25.030 --> 01:08:29.030]  Iowa governor signs bills restricting sex books,
[01:08:29.030 --> 01:08:33.030]  teaching gender identity and sexual orientation in elementary schools.
[01:08:33.030 --> 01:08:36.030]  It's sad that you even have to do that.
[01:08:37.030 --> 01:08:38.030]  But you've seen the literature,
[01:08:38.030 --> 01:08:40.030]  you've seen the propaganda aimed at children
[01:08:40.030 --> 01:08:42.030]  that they're bringing into the classrooms now,
[01:08:42.030 --> 01:08:44.030]  so you do have to do that.
[01:08:45.030 --> 01:08:47.030]  Governor Christy Noem calls for college board
[01:08:47.030 --> 01:08:52.030]  to prohibit drag shows and remove references to preferred pronouns.
[01:08:56.030 --> 01:08:58.030]  Well, calling for the college board to do that doesn't do much.
[01:08:58.030 --> 01:08:59.030]  I doubt they will.
[01:09:00.030 --> 01:09:02.030]  I think the Iowa governor's move is the right one.
[01:09:03.030 --> 01:09:04.030]  Ban it.
[01:09:04.030 --> 01:09:07.030]  I would say just ban it, everything from high school down.
[01:09:08.030 --> 01:09:09.030]  Maybe don't even mess with the colleges.
[01:09:09.030 --> 01:09:11.030]  Ban it, everything high school down.
[01:09:11.030 --> 01:09:13.030]  Unless the whole pronoun thing, I mean, that's just,
[01:09:14.030 --> 01:09:15.030]  that's a whole other issue.
[01:09:15.030 --> 01:09:17.030]  They're just rewriting language.
[01:09:18.030 --> 01:09:21.030]  So, I mean, I guess if you want that in your higher education, good luck.
[01:09:23.030 --> 01:09:25.030]  Higher education is now lower indoctrination.
[01:09:26.030 --> 01:09:29.030]  Woke Twilight actress with non-binary child
[01:09:29.030 --> 01:09:32.030]  gets blasted after calling Target boycotters terrorists
[01:09:33.030 --> 01:09:36.030]  and whining over store-removing LGBT products.
[01:09:36.030 --> 01:09:38.030]  And, you know, it's actually sad
[01:09:39.030 --> 01:09:41.030]  because you have this infighting inside the Republican Party,
[01:09:42.030 --> 01:09:43.030]  which I've expressed before.
[01:09:43.030 --> 01:09:45.030]  Don't get too concerned about it.
[01:09:45.030 --> 01:09:46.030]  This is probably going to be a healthy process,
[01:09:47.030 --> 01:09:49.030]  all things considered, once we get to 2024.
[01:09:50.030 --> 01:09:54.030]  But you're sitting here watching this conservative infighting,
[01:09:54.030 --> 01:09:56.030]  Republican infighting, Trump DeSantis.
[01:09:57.030 --> 01:10:00.030]  Is it good that people go into Target and film or smash up pride signs?
[01:10:01.030 --> 01:10:02.030]  And it's just funny to me.
[01:10:03.030 --> 01:10:04.030]  It's just funny to me that we'd rather sit here
[01:10:04.030 --> 01:10:06.030]  and scratch and claw at ourselves
[01:10:07.030 --> 01:10:09.030]  instead of dealing with the real issues,
[01:10:10.030 --> 01:10:13.030]  like the fact that they're targeting your children for sex,
[01:10:14.030 --> 01:10:18.030]  like the fact that the Democrats run massive ballot-harvesting initiatives
[01:10:18.030 --> 01:10:20.030]  that allow them to win the major states
[01:10:20.030 --> 01:10:22.030]  and win presidential elections.
[01:10:23.030 --> 01:10:25.030]  That's what our focus should be.
[01:10:25.030 --> 01:10:26.030]  But how ironic is it?
[01:10:30.030 --> 01:10:33.030]  They say conservatives that boycott Target are terrorists
[01:10:34.030 --> 01:10:35.030]  How many...
[01:10:36.030 --> 01:10:38.030]  Look, this thing went totally viral over the weekend.
[01:10:39.030 --> 01:10:41.030]  The sarcasm of showing all the clips of Target
[01:10:42.030 --> 01:10:44.030]  getting burned to the ground and looted and everything else
[01:10:44.030 --> 01:10:48.030]  during the BLM, George Floyd, Antifa riots of 2020,
[01:10:48.030 --> 01:10:50.030]  the summer of 2020, the summer of rage.
[01:10:50.030 --> 01:10:52.030]  175 Target stores shut down.
[01:10:52.030 --> 01:10:55.030]  That's literal terrorism.
[01:10:55.030 --> 01:11:00.030]  That is literally left-wing terrorism.
[01:11:00.030 --> 01:11:04.030]  Literally the definition of leftist terrorism.
[01:11:04.030 --> 01:11:05.030]  And that's what they did.
[01:11:07.030 --> 01:11:10.030]  You boycotted a Target, they call that terrorism.
[01:11:10.030 --> 01:11:14.030]  You burn down and loot a Target, they call that a peaceful protest.
[01:11:16.030 --> 01:11:18.030]  Maybe that's a little too extended.
[01:11:18.030 --> 01:11:21.030]  Why don't we narrow the purview?
[01:11:22.030 --> 01:11:27.030]  Utah Target evacuated after it received a bomb threat
[01:11:27.030 --> 01:11:31.030]  for turning its back on the LGBT community.
[01:11:31.030 --> 01:11:35.030]  Oh, is that conservative terrorism again?
[01:11:35.030 --> 01:11:38.030]  No, that's leftist terrorism again.
[01:11:38.030 --> 01:11:41.030]  A Target in Layton, Utah, was evacuated after bomb threats
[01:11:41.030 --> 01:11:44.030]  were made against the store and several others
[01:11:44.030 --> 01:11:48.030]  in Utah and Ohio, two local news stations.
[01:11:48.030 --> 01:11:51.030]  So a radical left-winger, the real terrorists.
[01:11:51.030 --> 01:11:54.030]  Police said the threats were made from a
[01:11:55.030 --> 01:11:57.030]  quote, bonus email address.
[01:11:57.030 --> 01:12:01.030]  A local Ohio newspaper also received an email threatening five stores
[01:12:01.030 --> 01:12:03.030]  claiming we will continue to bomb your Targets
[01:12:03.030 --> 01:12:05.030]  until you stop cowering.
[01:12:07.030 --> 01:12:09.030]  Who are the real terrorists?
[01:12:09.030 --> 01:12:11.030]  Threatening to bomb Targets?
[01:12:11.030 --> 01:12:14.030]  Actually did, with their violence, shut down 175 Targets?
[01:12:14.030 --> 01:12:17.030]  Oh yeah, those were liberal Democrat progressives.
[01:12:17.030 --> 01:12:19.030]  That's who they were. Those are the real ones.
[01:12:19.030 --> 01:12:22.030]  Every. Single. Time.
[01:12:22.030 --> 01:12:24.030]  Every. Single. Time.
[01:12:24.030 --> 01:12:27.030]  But yeah, you stepped foot on the wrong blade of grass
[01:12:27.030 --> 01:12:30.030]  on the wrong day in the wrong town, you might go to jail for 18 years.
[01:12:30.030 --> 01:12:34.030]  Climate activists arrested on federal conspiracy charges
[01:12:34.030 --> 01:12:37.030]  for damaging Degas display at DC Museum.
[01:12:37.030 --> 01:12:41.030]  So chalk that one up to another far-left terrorist
[01:12:41.030 --> 01:12:45.030]  desecrating venerable objects, destroying historical archives,
[01:12:45.030 --> 01:12:50.030]  destroying acts, or rather works of art,
[01:12:50.030 --> 01:12:54.030]  timeless works of art across the entire planet,
[01:12:54.030 --> 01:12:55.030]  not just here in the U.S.
[01:12:55.030 --> 01:12:57.030]  That's the left.
[01:12:57.030 --> 01:13:00.030]  They also like to superglue themselves to highways.
[01:13:00.030 --> 01:13:05.030]  Yes, I think we should leave them there when they do it.
[01:13:05.030 --> 01:13:09.030]  And I think we should leave them as part of the display too.
[01:13:09.030 --> 01:13:10.030]  That would be my new tactic.
[01:13:10.030 --> 01:13:14.030]  Because you know, when you're dealing with children,
[01:13:14.030 --> 01:13:18.030]  when you're dealing with immature individuals, children,
[01:13:18.030 --> 01:13:21.030]  you know, you got to find creative ways to discipline them
[01:13:21.030 --> 01:13:23.030]  to get them to learn, right?
[01:13:23.030 --> 01:13:25.030]  Sometimes the standard protocols
[01:13:25.030 --> 01:13:28.030]  or the normal approaches towards discipline
[01:13:28.030 --> 01:13:30.030]  don't work with all children.
[01:13:30.030 --> 01:13:31.030]  So you have to find new approaches.
[01:13:31.030 --> 01:13:34.030]  And that's what we're going to have to do with these climate activists
[01:13:34.030 --> 01:13:37.030]  that keep destroying property and art
[01:13:37.030 --> 01:13:40.030]  and glue themselves to the streets.
[01:13:40.030 --> 01:13:42.030]  We're going to have to change the way we discipline them.
[01:13:43.030 --> 01:13:46.030]  No longer arresting them and throwing them in jail for a night or whatever
[01:13:46.030 --> 01:13:47.030]  is good enough.
[01:13:47.030 --> 01:13:49.030]  No, what needs to be done now,
[01:13:49.030 --> 01:13:53.030]  the new disciplinary action to work with these immature children,
[01:13:53.030 --> 01:13:54.030]  climate terrorists,
[01:13:54.030 --> 01:13:58.030]  is you need to make them a permanent part of the exhibit.
[01:13:58.030 --> 01:14:00.030]  That's what you should do.
[01:14:00.030 --> 01:14:02.030]  So when they superglue themselves to the streets
[01:14:02.030 --> 01:14:04.030]  or the city sidewalks or wherever,
[01:14:04.030 --> 01:14:06.030]  just take a couple cones out there,
[01:14:06.030 --> 01:14:07.030]  put the cones around them,
[01:14:07.030 --> 01:14:10.030]  and say, okay, you get your protest now.
[01:14:10.030 --> 01:14:11.030]  Good luck.
[01:14:14.030 --> 01:14:16.030]  We'll see how that goes.
[01:14:16.030 --> 01:14:20.030]  We'll see how long they like being superglued to the streets
[01:14:20.030 --> 01:14:22.030]  before they rip their own skin off.
[01:14:22.030 --> 01:14:28.030]  And we'll see how much the other members of society
[01:14:28.030 --> 01:14:32.030]  enjoy having a lunatic that superglued himself to the street
[01:14:32.030 --> 01:14:36.030]  be sitting there crying about climate change.
[01:14:36.030 --> 01:14:39.030]  Let's see how that works.
[01:14:39.030 --> 01:14:43.030]  My guess is that will deter that type of activity.
[01:14:43.030 --> 01:14:46.030]  Same thing when they destroy the art exhibits here.
[01:14:46.030 --> 01:14:48.030]  I wouldn't detain them.
[01:14:48.030 --> 01:14:49.030]  I wouldn't remove them.
[01:14:49.030 --> 01:14:52.030]  I would make them a permanent part of the exhibit.
[01:14:52.030 --> 01:14:57.030]  I would seriously handcuff them to the exhibit.
[01:14:57.030 --> 01:14:59.030]  Now, there actually might be a way to do this,
[01:14:59.030 --> 01:15:05.030]  depending on local jurisdictions and what their laws are, let's say.
[01:15:05.030 --> 01:15:07.030]  You might be able to detain people in public for,
[01:15:07.030 --> 01:15:10.030]  quote-unquote, 24 hours, detain them in public if you view them as a threat.
[01:15:10.030 --> 01:15:11.030]  So I'm serious.
[01:15:11.030 --> 01:15:16.030]  They superglued themselves to a work of art or a display.
[01:15:16.030 --> 01:15:18.030]  Let them sit there for 24 hours.
[01:15:18.030 --> 01:15:20.030]  Let's let the world see.
[01:15:20.030 --> 01:15:22.030]  This is now part of the art exhibit.
[01:15:22.030 --> 01:15:25.030]  A deranged climate terrorist that wanted to destroy this and ruin your day,
[01:15:25.030 --> 01:15:27.030]  now part of the exhibit.
[01:15:29.030 --> 01:15:31.030]  Here, speaking of an exhibit,
[01:15:31.030 --> 01:15:35.030]  revealed disgraced former Biden official Sam Brinton,
[01:15:35.030 --> 01:15:37.030]  yes, that Sam Brinton,
[01:15:37.030 --> 01:15:41.030]  was a member of a drag nun group that is now promoted by the L.A. Dodgers.
[01:15:41.030 --> 01:15:45.030]  So the kleptomaniac who likes to wear other people's skin but can't,
[01:15:45.030 --> 01:15:47.030]  so he wears their clothing after he steals it,
[01:15:47.030 --> 01:15:49.030]  he was also a drag nun.
[01:15:49.030 --> 01:15:51.030]  He's into puppy kink play.
[01:15:51.030 --> 01:15:55.030]  He was, you know, Biden's official with the nuclear waste department.
[01:15:55.030 --> 01:15:57.030]  Yeah.
[01:15:59.030 --> 01:16:02.030]  Every time I talk to you, you're either, like, on the border exposing the cartels,
[01:16:02.030 --> 01:16:04.030]  like, coming under fire,
[01:16:04.030 --> 01:16:06.030]  or you're on the streets of some American city
[01:16:06.030 --> 01:16:08.030]  hanging out with drug addicts and criminals,
[01:16:08.030 --> 01:16:11.030]  and now you've gone to ground zero of a massive chemical spill.
[01:16:11.030 --> 01:16:13.030]  Are you addicted to the danger, Savannah?
[01:16:13.030 --> 01:16:15.030]  Have you ever considered that for a second?
[01:16:15.030 --> 01:16:18.030]  No, I'm addicted to helping my fellow Americans.
[01:16:18.030 --> 01:16:20.030]  I'm addicted to spreading the truth,
[01:16:20.030 --> 01:16:22.030]  and again, you know, I have InfoWars to thank for that.
[01:16:22.030 --> 01:16:26.030]  Looking back on the day I was able to ask President Donald Trump two questions,
[01:16:26.030 --> 01:16:28.030]  I was so grateful because, you know,
[01:16:28.030 --> 01:16:31.030]  I truly was classically trained under Alex Jones
[01:16:31.030 --> 01:16:33.030]  and under the InfoWars team,
[01:16:33.030 --> 01:16:36.030]  and I really do credit that as to why I'm able to, you know,
[01:16:36.030 --> 01:16:38.030]  get these types of clips,
[01:16:38.030 --> 01:16:40.030]  because Alex's whole mentality was, you know,
[01:16:40.030 --> 01:16:44.030]  go where the story is, go where the mainstream media refuses to.
[01:16:44.030 --> 01:16:46.030]  So it's not that I'm addicted to the insanity,
[01:16:46.030 --> 01:16:48.030]  I'm just addicted to telling the truth
[01:16:48.030 --> 01:16:50.030]  and helping the American people,
[01:16:50.030 --> 01:16:52.030]  and I really do credit Alex for, you know,
[01:16:52.030 --> 01:16:54.030]  really instilling that within me early on in my career.
[01:16:55.030 --> 01:16:57.030]  In the early 1900s,
[01:16:57.030 --> 01:16:59.030]  certain companies were off-gassing
[01:16:59.030 --> 01:17:03.030]  highly toxic fluoride gases into the atmosphere.
[01:17:03.030 --> 01:17:06.030]  The surrounding communities began to get sick.
[01:17:06.030 --> 01:17:09.030]  Laws were enacted to compel these corporations
[01:17:09.030 --> 01:17:12.030]  to install scrubbers to convert these gases
[01:17:12.030 --> 01:17:14.030]  into fluorosilicic acid.
[01:17:14.030 --> 01:17:16.030]  Still highly toxic, but containable.
[01:17:16.030 --> 01:17:19.030]  Now these companies had a stockpile of this poison,
[01:17:19.030 --> 01:17:22.030]  and there was no affordable way to get rid of it.
[01:17:22.030 --> 01:17:24.030]  Lucky for them, one of their major stockholders
[01:17:24.030 --> 01:17:27.030]  was also the secretary of the treasury,
[01:17:27.030 --> 01:17:30.030]  who was responsible for the public health service at the time.
[01:17:30.030 --> 01:17:33.030]  And by 1950, the U.S. government began buying
[01:17:33.030 --> 01:17:36.030]  this toxic, untreated industrial waste product
[01:17:36.030 --> 01:17:39.030]  and dumping it into our drinking water.
[01:17:39.030 --> 01:17:41.030]  Reputable studies show that it's causing
[01:17:41.030 --> 01:17:44.030]  various cancers and other disease.
[01:17:44.030 --> 01:17:46.030]  With the Alexa Pure Pro,
[01:17:46.030 --> 01:17:48.030]  you can have clean drinking water
[01:17:48.030 --> 01:17:50.030]  and a regular drinking water.
[01:17:50.030 --> 01:17:52.030]  You can have clean drinking water,
[01:17:52.030 --> 01:17:54.030]  and a remedy to this madness.

[01:17:58.030 --> 01:18:01.030]  Ladies and gentlemen, the truth, the solution
[01:18:01.030 --> 01:18:03.030]  is laying right there in front of you,
[01:18:03.030 --> 01:18:05.030]  hidden in plain view.
[01:18:05.030 --> 01:18:07.030]  Please listen to me in the next 60 seconds.
[01:18:07.030 --> 01:18:09.030]  If you go to Wikipedia,
[01:18:09.030 --> 01:18:11.030]  it has links to the UN's own website
[01:18:11.030 --> 01:18:13.030]  where they admit the number one cause
[01:18:13.030 --> 01:18:15.030]  of cognitive disability in the world
[01:18:15.030 --> 01:18:17.030]  is iodine deficiency.
[01:18:17.030 --> 01:18:19.030]  The number one preventable cause
[01:18:19.030 --> 01:18:21.030]  of intellectual disability
[01:18:21.030 --> 01:18:25.030]  is lack of real, pure iodine in the body
[01:18:25.030 --> 01:18:27.030]  as they bomb us with the bad halogens,
[01:18:27.030 --> 01:18:30.030]  bromine, bromide, chlorine, and so much more.
[01:18:30.030 --> 01:18:32.030]  Upwards of 2 billion people
[01:18:32.030 --> 01:18:34.030]  in a Lancet Medical Journal study
[01:18:34.030 --> 01:18:37.030]  in 2007 worldwide have cognitive disabilities
[01:18:37.030 --> 01:18:40.030]  because they don't have high quality iodine.
[01:18:40.030 --> 01:18:42.030]  Most iodine is bound to other elements,
[01:18:42.030 --> 01:18:43.030]  you don't absorb it.
[01:18:43.030 --> 01:18:45.030]  We have X3, all three types of good iodine,
[01:18:45.030 --> 01:18:48.030]  together that supercharges your body.

[01:19:59.030 --> 01:20:01.030]  Leading a frontal assault
[01:20:01.030 --> 01:20:04.030]  on the lies of the New World Order,
[01:20:04.030 --> 01:20:06.030]  it's Alex Jones.
[01:20:07.250 --> 01:20:22.010]  Alright, let's take a look at some of the political news here.
[01:20:22.010 --> 01:20:30.050]  This is a growing phenomenon, it also ties into the whole BRICS success story.
[01:20:30.050 --> 01:20:33.490]  China rejecting contact with U.S. military according to the Pentagon.
[01:20:33.490 --> 01:20:39.290]  So is this because China's recent relations with Russia?
[01:20:39.290 --> 01:20:45.490]  Is this because China is so sick and tired of the Biden administration?
[01:20:45.490 --> 01:20:46.730]  Is something else going on?
[01:20:46.730 --> 01:20:49.330]  Is it a combination of that and other things?
[01:20:49.330 --> 01:20:58.330]  It's pretty significant though, considering the current geopolitical strife going on.
[01:20:58.330 --> 01:21:01.490]  And they don't want to make a big deal of this because it's embarrassing, folks.
[01:21:01.490 --> 01:21:06.210]  This is an embarrassment to the Biden administration that China won't even pick up their phone
[01:21:06.210 --> 01:21:07.210]  calls.
[01:21:07.210 --> 01:21:09.930]  So just add it to the list of countries that won't pick up Biden's phone calls.
[01:21:09.930 --> 01:21:11.530]  Nobody respects this administration.
[01:21:11.530 --> 01:21:14.050]  Everybody knows they're a bunch of crooks and liars.
[01:21:14.050 --> 01:21:16.530]  So the debt ceiling has been a major topic.
[01:21:16.530 --> 01:21:20.370]  It looks like McCarthy took the L here.
[01:21:20.370 --> 01:21:22.090]  Debt ceiling deal, what's in?
[01:21:22.090 --> 01:21:24.490]  What's out of the agreement to avert U.S. default?
[01:21:24.490 --> 01:21:26.450]  Well, we really don't know everything yet.
[01:21:26.450 --> 01:21:31.250]  Here are some of the reported details of the debt limit agreement between Biden and McCarthy.
[01:21:31.450 --> 01:21:32.450]  Senator Rand Paul doesn't like it.
[01:21:32.450 --> 01:21:34.210]  This deal is insanity.
[01:21:34.210 --> 01:21:37.170]  Conservatives blast McCarthy's debt ceiling deal with Biden.
[01:21:37.170 --> 01:21:42.090]  House lawmakers furious over deal raising debt ceiling by $4 trillion with no cap on
[01:21:42.090 --> 01:21:48.410]  spending for two more years, maintaining Democrats wish list and keeping in place the IRS expansion
[01:21:48.410 --> 01:21:50.450]  by 98 percent.
[01:21:50.450 --> 01:21:55.970]  Fake conservatives agree to fake spending cuts, mock Senator Rand Paul.
[01:21:55.970 --> 01:21:59.490]  Conservative House Republicans are sounding the alarm over Speaker Kevin McCarthy's debt
[01:21:59.490 --> 01:22:04.730]  ceiling deal with the Biden regime, which was just announced last night.
[01:22:04.730 --> 01:22:09.250]  Yet McCarthy has been taking victory laps since the deal was announced, calling it a
[01:22:09.250 --> 01:22:12.210]  step in the right direction, in part because it doesn't raise taxes.
[01:22:12.210 --> 01:22:13.810]  Well, it should have cut taxes.
[01:22:13.810 --> 01:22:14.930]  Property taxes should be illegal.
[01:22:14.930 --> 01:22:15.970]  It's theft.
[01:22:15.970 --> 01:22:20.010]  So McCarthy took the L. He's going to try to take the W, pretend like he took the W.
[01:22:20.010 --> 01:22:23.090]  He took the L. Bad news for Americans.
[01:22:23.090 --> 01:22:30.530]  98 percent of 800 excuse me, 98 percent of 87000 new IRS agents are here to stay after
[01:22:30.530 --> 01:22:32.330]  McCarthy caves into Democrats.
[01:22:32.330 --> 01:22:36.250]  So they're going to be the ones coming to your front door with guns saying you didn't
[01:22:36.250 --> 01:22:37.690]  pay the government enough money.
[01:22:37.690 --> 01:22:39.130]  You didn't pay the mafia.
[01:22:39.130 --> 01:22:42.490]  You didn't you didn't give the mafia their cut.
[01:22:42.490 --> 01:22:48.210]  So now they're coming to your front door and it's going to be people that get paid on cash
[01:22:48.210 --> 01:22:50.010]  app and Venmo.
[01:22:50.010 --> 01:22:54.370]  It's going to be people that make money in tips, waitresses, bartenders.
[01:22:54.370 --> 01:22:55.810]  They're going to be coming for you first.
[01:22:55.810 --> 01:22:59.890]  They're going to be coming for content creators on the Internet that they don't make a lot
[01:22:59.890 --> 01:23:02.090]  of money, but don't file for taxes.
[01:23:02.090 --> 01:23:05.850]  And of course, they're going to be coming after Christians and Catholics and conservatives
[01:23:05.850 --> 01:23:06.850]  as well.
[01:23:06.850 --> 01:23:11.370]  This is a new weapon of the Biden administration, a new weapon of the American authoritarian
[01:23:11.370 --> 01:23:15.370]  left to come after its political opposition.
[01:23:15.370 --> 01:23:20.370]  So we'll see what happens with that story as it develops this week.
[01:23:20.370 --> 01:23:25.730]  But yes, I would guess that McCarthy took a big fat L on this deal and he can take as
[01:23:25.730 --> 01:23:27.770]  many victory laps as he wants.
[01:23:27.770 --> 01:23:29.890]  I don't think it's going to work now.
[01:23:29.890 --> 01:23:32.290]  What's going on in Texas is a concern.
[01:23:32.290 --> 01:23:38.890]  Ken Paxton, one of the great attorney generals in this country, is under attack from the swamp
[01:23:38.890 --> 01:23:44.610]  from the left and sadly the right here in Texas.
[01:23:44.610 --> 01:23:47.290]  The Republican Party has turned their back on him.
[01:23:47.290 --> 01:23:48.690]  The Texas voters.
[01:23:48.690 --> 01:23:50.570]  It's a sad state of affairs.
[01:23:50.570 --> 01:23:55.010]  Texas lawmakers issued 20 articles of impeachment against State Attorney General Ken Paxton.
[01:23:55.010 --> 01:23:58.050]  Now there's a bunch of stuff on this.
[01:23:58.050 --> 01:24:03.050]  Here is one individual involved in that process, breaking it down in clip 11.
[01:24:03.050 --> 01:24:11.250]  It was filled with falsehoods and misrepresentations, and they have never reached out to our office
[01:24:11.250 --> 01:24:18.250]  to determine whether anything that was contained in that testimony yesterday was remotely true.
[01:24:18.250 --> 01:24:21.790]  The process here has been completely lacking.
[01:24:21.790 --> 01:24:25.690]  They deserve to hear, the people deserve to hear from this office in the context of this
[01:24:25.690 --> 01:24:26.690]  investigation.
[01:24:26.690 --> 01:24:30.290]  Furthermore, this is an illegal investigation.
[01:24:30.290 --> 01:24:36.170]  Any discussion of impeachment is completely foreclosed by Texas law.
[01:24:36.170 --> 01:24:44.330]  Texas government code 665.081 says clearly that any proposed impeachment can only be
[01:24:44.330 --> 01:24:46.730]  about conduct since the most recent election.
[01:24:46.730 --> 01:24:47.770]  The voters have spoken.
[01:24:47.770 --> 01:24:50.090]  They want Ken Paxton.
[01:24:50.090 --> 01:24:51.650]  The voters want Ken Paxton.
[01:24:51.650 --> 01:24:56.290]  And this committee, by investigating him, by not allowing us to be heard here today,
[01:24:56.290 --> 01:25:01.810]  by never reaching out to us at any time during this investigative process, is trying to thwart
[01:25:01.810 --> 01:25:03.090]  the will of the voters.
[01:25:03.090 --> 01:25:04.810]  We deserve to be heard here today.
[01:25:04.850 --> 01:25:07.450]  They should let me register to testify as a resource witness.
[01:25:07.450 --> 01:25:11.450]  They should have asked our office about any of the facts that they heard yesterday, which
[01:25:11.450 --> 01:25:15.810]  by the way, have been reported for years, for years.
[01:25:15.810 --> 01:25:22.370]  The 2022 election, the primary and the general, was run on these issues, these allegations.
[01:25:22.370 --> 01:25:24.170]  The voters have spoken.
[01:25:24.170 --> 01:25:26.570]  They want Ken Paxton as their attorney general.
[01:25:26.570 --> 01:25:28.290]  This committee should hear from us today.
[01:25:28.290 --> 01:25:29.850]  Do you think the committee is having this meeting?
[01:25:29.850 --> 01:25:33.610]  Do you think this room is being used for a committee hearing and we're not able to be
[01:25:33.610 --> 01:25:34.610]  taking anything?
[01:25:34.610 --> 01:25:36.650]  If y'all want to continue, you're welcome to move out.
[01:25:36.650 --> 01:25:39.930]  But right now, the room is being used for a formal meeting.
[01:25:39.930 --> 01:25:41.170]  Yeah, get out of the room.
[01:25:41.170 --> 01:25:43.490]  They always hate it when the truth gets spoken.
[01:25:43.490 --> 01:25:48.890]  Trump calls out Governor Abbott for being missing in action on RINO impeachment of Attorney
[01:25:48.890 --> 01:25:49.890]  General Ken Paxton.
[01:25:49.890 --> 01:25:55.450]  And it just shows how out of touch the Republican Party is that they're not supporting Ken Paxton
[01:25:55.450 --> 01:25:58.150]  with as much might as possible.
[01:25:58.150 --> 01:26:01.570]  Trump gets it, Abbott not so much.
[01:26:01.570 --> 01:26:03.430]  It's really a shame.
[01:26:03.430 --> 01:26:07.790]  And Ken Paxton is continuing to get stuff done, even though they've now suspended him.
[01:26:07.790 --> 01:26:11.950]  The health and safety of the people of Texas will always be my number one priority.
[01:26:11.950 --> 01:26:16.470]  Pharmaceutical companies are being held responsible for the damage caused by the opioid epidemic.
[01:26:16.470 --> 01:26:19.630]  Walgreens will help prevent this tragic epidemic from taking more lives in the future, and
[01:26:19.630 --> 01:26:24.790]  it will also provide treatment for those still struggling, said Ken Paxton after he secured
[01:26:24.790 --> 01:26:31.950]  a $340 million for Texas in the opioid settlement against Walgreens.
[01:26:31.950 --> 01:26:33.470]  Oh, he's taking down big pharma.
[01:26:33.470 --> 01:26:37.070]  I guess now we know why they got to take him out and all the Republicans in on it, too,
[01:26:37.070 --> 01:26:38.950]  because they probably get big pharmaceutical money.
[01:26:38.950 --> 01:26:46.230]  Now, Paxton issued this statement in response to the illegal impeachment.
[01:26:46.230 --> 01:26:50.790]  The ugly spectacle in the Texas House today confirmed the outrageous impeachment plot against
[01:26:50.790 --> 01:26:53.070]  me was never meant to be fair or just.
[01:26:53.070 --> 01:26:55.750]  It was a politically motivated sham from the beginning.
[01:26:55.750 --> 01:27:00.110]  My office made every effort to present evidence, testimony and irrefutable facts that would
[01:27:00.110 --> 01:27:04.350]  have disproven the countless false statements and outright lies advanced by Speaker Dade
[01:27:04.350 --> 01:27:09.630]  Phelan, the one that's drunk at the podium, allegedly.
[01:27:09.630 --> 01:27:14.950]  And the Murr-Johnson panel he appointed, unfortunately, they refused to consider anything that would
[01:27:14.950 --> 01:27:17.670]  interfere with their desired result.
[01:27:17.670 --> 01:27:22.950]  They disregarded the law, ignored the facts and demonstrated contempt for Texas voters.
[01:27:22.950 --> 01:27:27.070]  Texas voters know that Speaker Phelan and the corrupt politicians he controls are more
[01:27:27.070 --> 01:27:31.190]  focused on political retribution against conservatives and the welfare of the people.
[01:27:31.190 --> 01:27:35.010]  Instead of passing critical legislation that would strengthen our border, protect our elections
[01:27:35.010 --> 01:27:39.750]  or stop the Chinese Communist Party from buying up Texas land, they chose to spend the final
[01:27:39.750 --> 01:27:43.990]  days of the legislative session smearing me.
[01:27:43.990 --> 01:27:48.310]  Phelan's coalition of Democrats and liberal Republicans is now in lockstep with the Biden
[01:27:48.310 --> 01:27:53.790]  administration, the abortion industry, anti-gun zealots and woke corporations to sabotage
[01:27:53.790 --> 01:27:58.550]  my work as Attorney General, including our ongoing litigation to stop illegal immigration,
[01:27:58.550 --> 01:28:03.870]  uphold the rule of law and protect the constitutional rights of every Texan.
[01:28:03.870 --> 01:28:08.770]  But the people of Texas know that I have always had their back and in return they have always
[01:28:08.770 --> 01:28:10.350]  had mine.
[01:28:10.350 --> 01:28:14.750]  What we witness today is not just about me, it's about the corrupt establishment's eagerness
[01:28:14.750 --> 01:28:19.190]  to overpower the millions of Texas voters who already made their voices heard when they
[01:28:19.190 --> 01:28:21.310]  overwhelmingly re-elected me.
[01:28:21.310 --> 01:28:25.430]  I am beyond grateful to have the support of millions of Texans who recognize that what
[01:28:25.430 --> 01:28:29.110]  we just witnessed is illegal, unethical and profoundly unjust.
[01:28:29.110 --> 01:28:32.670]  I look forward to a quick resolution in the Texas Senate.
[01:28:32.670 --> 01:28:36.150]  Will I have full confidence the process will be fair and just?
[01:28:36.150 --> 01:28:40.809]  So this is what the radical left does, folks, throughout human history.
[01:28:40.809 --> 01:28:47.750]  When they get controls over all the levers of power, they use them to their fullest extent
[01:28:47.750 --> 01:28:51.190]  against their political opposition.
[01:28:51.190 --> 01:28:56.870]  And the latest example is what they're doing to the great Attorney General, Ken Paxton.
[01:28:56.870 --> 01:29:02.870]  Thousands of former Nazis went to work for the United States government.
[01:29:02.870 --> 01:29:06.870]  A flying disk has been found and is now in the possession of the army.
[01:29:06.870 --> 01:29:09.470]  There is a bulletin from CBS News.
[01:29:09.470 --> 01:29:11.470]  President Kennedy has been shot.
[01:29:11.470 --> 01:29:15.470]  This is a different kind of war.
[01:29:15.470 --> 01:29:19.470]  The USS Liberty had just been attacked by Israeli jets and torpedoes.
[01:29:19.750 --> 01:29:22.750]  The CIA could manipulate the news in the United States.
[01:29:22.750 --> 01:29:26.750]  They took the babies out of incubators and left the children to die on the cold floor.
[01:29:26.750 --> 01:29:29.750]  It was almost as if there were a plan in motion.
[01:29:29.750 --> 01:29:30.750]  It just happened.
[01:29:30.750 --> 01:29:32.750]  We need to go into the Capitol.
[01:29:32.750 --> 01:29:33.750]  Stop!
[01:29:33.750 --> 01:29:34.750]  Stop!
[01:29:34.750 --> 01:29:35.750]  Stop!
[01:29:35.750 --> 01:29:36.750]  You will always have conspiracy theories.
[01:29:36.750 --> 01:29:38.750]  They are nothing but distractions.
[01:29:38.750 --> 01:29:41.750]  You guys censored Harvard educated doctors.
[01:29:41.750 --> 01:29:43.750]  You silenced those voices.
[01:29:43.750 --> 01:29:46.750]  What we want to do in Davos is push the reset button.
[01:29:47.030 --> 01:29:50.030]  Soon as we start exposing the great reset,
[01:29:50.030 --> 01:29:54.030]  the sooner these globalists start going to prison.
[01:30:17.030 --> 01:30:19.030]  Still highly toxic, but containable.
[01:30:19.030 --> 01:30:23.030]  Now these companies had a stockpile of this poison.
[01:30:23.030 --> 01:30:25.030]  And there was no affordable way to dispose of it.
[01:30:25.030 --> 01:30:30.030]  Lucky for them, one of their major stockholders was also the Secretary of the Treasury,
[01:30:30.030 --> 01:30:34.030]  who was responsible for the public health service at the time.
[01:30:34.030 --> 01:30:40.030]  And by 1950, the US government began buying this toxic, untreated industrial waste product
[01:30:40.030 --> 01:30:43.030]  and dumping it into our drinking water.
[01:30:43.309 --> 01:30:48.309]  Reputable studies show that it's causing various cancers and other disease.
[01:30:48.309 --> 01:30:52.309]  With the Alexa Pure Pro, you can have clean drinking water.
[01:30:52.309 --> 01:30:54.309]  And a remedy to this madness.
[01:30:54.309 --> 01:30:58.309]  Available now at Infowarsstore.com.
[01:30:58.309 --> 01:31:03.309]  Just weeks ago, I warned the world that the globalists were going to move against Tucker Carlson
[01:31:03.309 --> 01:31:05.309]  and take him off the air.
[01:31:05.309 --> 01:31:07.309]  People said, no way, he's the most powerful thing that ever happened.
[01:31:07.309 --> 01:31:09.309]  They've got quadrillions of stolen money.
[01:31:09.309 --> 01:31:12.309]  They only had Tucker Carlson on the air because they believed they could control him.
[01:31:12.590 --> 01:31:15.590]  But as soon as they figured out they couldn't, he was taken off the air.
[01:31:15.590 --> 01:31:17.590]  It's the same thing with Infowars.
[01:31:17.590 --> 01:31:19.590]  But Infowars is not owned by Fox.
[01:31:19.590 --> 01:31:21.590]  Or controlled by George Soros.
[01:31:21.590 --> 01:31:23.590]  Or owned by Spotify like Joe Rogan.
[01:31:23.590 --> 01:31:27.590]  We are only beholden to our viewers and our listeners.
[01:31:27.590 --> 01:31:29.590]  And when you support us, we're unstoppable.
[01:31:29.590 --> 01:31:32.590]  I'm not underwritten by Rupert Murdoch.
[01:31:32.590 --> 01:31:34.590]  Or by George Soros.
[01:31:34.590 --> 01:31:36.590]  I'm underwritten by you.
[01:31:36.590 --> 01:31:38.590]  Which is we the people.
[01:31:38.590 --> 01:31:41.590]  So I want to thank you for your support and encourage viewers and listeners to understand.
[01:31:41.870 --> 01:31:43.870]  Please don't take Infowars for granted.
[01:31:43.870 --> 01:31:45.870]  We're barely hanging on.
[01:31:45.870 --> 01:31:47.870]  We need your word of mouth, your prayer, your financial support.

[01:32:01.870 --> 01:32:03.870]  Joined by the one and only Greg Reese of the Reese Report.
[01:32:03.870 --> 01:32:05.870]  We wanted to hop on and send everybody to Infowarsstore.com.
[01:32:05.870 --> 01:32:07.870]  Click this QR code right above Greg Reese.
[01:32:07.870 --> 01:32:09.870]  Buy yourself a Faraday cage.
[01:32:10.150 --> 01:32:12.150]  Super male vitality.
[01:32:12.150 --> 01:32:14.150]  Or what Greg has.
[01:32:14.150 --> 01:32:16.150]  Greg, what do you got there?
[01:32:16.150 --> 01:32:18.150]  If you really want to treat yourself to something nice.
[01:32:18.150 --> 01:32:20.150]  Get yourself an Alexa Pure water filter.
[01:32:20.150 --> 01:32:22.150]  And get clean, healthy water.
[01:32:22.150 --> 01:32:24.150]  Whenever you want it.
[01:32:24.150 --> 01:32:26.150]  Wherever you want it.
[01:32:26.150 --> 01:32:28.150]  Even if the water pressure goes out.
[01:32:28.150 --> 01:32:30.150]  The Gravity Fed water filter has got you covered.
[01:32:30.150 --> 01:32:32.150]  Absolutely.
[01:32:32.150 --> 01:32:34.150]  And we couldn't do any of this without listener support.
[01:32:34.150 --> 01:32:36.150]  I was telling Greg earlier.
[01:32:36.150 --> 01:32:38.150]  We're like the real infowars.
[01:32:38.430 --> 01:32:40.430]  We're like the real NPR.
[01:32:40.430 --> 01:32:42.430]  The real NPR of the base right.

[01:33:04.430 --> 01:33:06.430]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[01:33:06.430 --> 01:33:08.710]  www.infowars.com
[01:33:07.660 --> 01:33:19.660]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[01:33:19.660 --> 01:33:22.660]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:22.660 --> 01:33:26.660]  And now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[01:33:26.660 --> 01:33:46.660]  Powered by the great products at infowarsstore.com, where your support keeps us on the air.
[01:33:46.660 --> 01:33:52.660]  Powered specifically by Turbo Force Plus at infowarsstore.com.
[01:33:52.660 --> 01:34:01.660]  And let me tell you, if you haven't heard about Turbo Force Plus, 10 hours of clean energy in one small container.
[01:34:01.660 --> 01:34:03.660]  From infowarsstore.com.
[01:34:03.660 --> 01:34:06.660]  One scoop gives you 10 hours of clean energy with great flavor, by the way.
[01:34:06.660 --> 01:34:10.660]  Got to tell you, a more advanced formula for optimum focus and energy.
[01:34:10.660 --> 01:34:14.660]  Now available at infowarsstore.com for 25% off.
[01:34:14.660 --> 01:34:19.660]  When it comes to retaining and regaining energy, convenience is key.
[01:34:19.660 --> 01:34:24.660]  Sure, coffee, candy, and other highly sugar-filled products can give you a short boost.
[01:34:24.660 --> 01:34:27.660]  But the crash is always the downside.
[01:34:27.660 --> 01:34:33.660]  That's why our team of scientists work with the Infowars crew to create a powerhouse mixable energy formula.
[01:34:33.660 --> 01:34:41.660]  And with the addition of Alpha GPC to our original and popular Turbo Force, we are taking Turbo Force Plus to the next level.
[01:34:41.660 --> 01:34:59.660]  This advanced formula can help support increased focus and energy with a sustained energy blend that contains amino acid for sustained energy, metabolism, and an herbal energy blend with very high levels of polyphenols and xanthine alkaloids for peak energy.
[01:34:59.660 --> 01:35:02.660]  Turbo Force Plus is a force to be reckoned with.
[01:35:02.660 --> 01:35:06.660]  And I can get into all the different ingredients in there.
[01:35:06.660 --> 01:35:14.660]  Vitamin C, thiamine, niacin, vitamin B6, L-taurine, beta alanine, and so much more.
[01:35:14.660 --> 01:35:15.660]  I mean, the list here is just crazy.
[01:35:15.660 --> 01:35:27.660]  L-theanine, green tea leaf extract, guarana seed extract, herbamonte leaf extract, and so much more goes into the Turbo Force Plus formula.
[01:35:27.660 --> 01:35:29.660]  25% off at infowarsstore.com.
[01:35:29.660 --> 01:35:40.660]  Folks, there's a reason why we open up the phone lines and so many people call in ranting and raving about how much they love Turbo Force, specifically truck drivers, pilots.
[01:35:40.660 --> 01:35:43.660]  They love the stuff, and so do I.
[01:35:43.660 --> 01:35:46.660]  Turbo Force Plus, 25% off, infowarsstore.com.
[01:35:46.660 --> 01:35:49.660]  Get it while supplies last.
[01:35:49.660 --> 01:35:50.660]  All right.
[01:35:50.660 --> 01:35:53.660]  I've got another stack of news I'm going to get to here.
[01:35:53.660 --> 01:35:56.660]  Harrison Smith will be hosting Infowars Sunday Night Live tonight.
[01:35:56.660 --> 01:35:58.660]  He plans on taking calls.
[01:35:58.660 --> 01:36:03.660]  So I'm going to loosen up the phone lines for him, and we'll go ahead and open them up now.
[01:36:03.660 --> 01:36:11.660]  877-789-2539, 877-789-2539.
[01:36:11.660 --> 01:36:17.660]  And don't worry if you don't get in with me, Harrison, we'll have plenty of time to get your call as well.
[01:36:17.660 --> 01:36:20.660]  Quick programming note, we will be live tomorrow.
[01:36:20.660 --> 01:36:26.660]  The Alex Jones Show will be live tomorrow with Alex Jones and yours truly.
[01:36:26.660 --> 01:36:28.660]  So be tuned in for that.
[01:36:28.660 --> 01:36:32.660]  The other shows will be airing some other special reports.
[01:36:32.660 --> 01:36:35.660]  But the Alex Jones Show will be live on Memorial Day.
[01:36:35.660 --> 01:36:41.660]  If you want to spend our Memorial Day with us, we will be live with Alex Jones.
[01:36:41.660 --> 01:36:46.660]  But phone lines open now, 877-789-2539.
[01:36:46.660 --> 01:36:50.660]  In the meantime, let's hit the rest of this news.
[01:36:50.660 --> 01:36:56.660]  Microsoft boss reveals his biggest AI fear in stark warning over dangerous tech.
[01:36:56.660 --> 01:37:00.660]  And so this is kind of a story that hasn't really been big.
[01:37:00.660 --> 01:37:05.660]  It's starting to kind of pick up, and I've constantly stressed it's something we're not talking about enough,
[01:37:05.660 --> 01:37:09.660]  especially now that the FDA has approved Neuralink.
[01:37:09.660 --> 01:37:11.660]  Now it really gets dangerous.
[01:37:11.660 --> 01:37:15.660]  I mean, one thing, you worry about AI maybe taking over our digital grid.
[01:37:15.660 --> 01:37:17.660]  Maybe you can just shut it off somehow.
[01:37:17.660 --> 01:37:23.660]  If it gets into our biology somehow with this Neuralink crap, we've got a whole other issue, folks.
[01:37:23.660 --> 01:37:31.660]  And it's funny because people are starting to realize what the elites are doing to maintain their youth.
[01:37:31.660 --> 01:37:36.660]  And if you want to know where they get these ingredients, well, that's one question.
[01:37:36.660 --> 01:37:45.660]  But we know, because some of them tell you, this tech mogul takes his son's blood in order to stay young and healthy.
[01:37:46.660 --> 01:37:53.660]  Brian Johnson may look like a middle-aged man, but inside his veins pumps the blood of a 17-year-old.
[01:37:53.660 --> 01:38:07.660]  And so this is just kind of the introduction surface level of the adrenochrome blood serums that the elite use to stay young.
[01:38:07.660 --> 01:38:14.660]  And there's a reason why you see all that representation, that symbology in films.
[01:38:14.660 --> 01:38:20.660]  I mean, even in Disney films, films dating back long decades ago.
[01:38:20.660 --> 01:38:28.660]  It's a known thing, using human blood to stay young.
[01:38:28.660 --> 01:38:31.660]  And sometimes now they just go on TV and brag about it.
[01:38:31.660 --> 01:38:38.660]  They just go on TV and brag about how they use the blood of the youth as skin serums and everything else.
[01:38:38.660 --> 01:38:41.660]  Yeah, one example might be the dark crystal.
[01:38:41.660 --> 01:38:49.660]  But it's one thing, as twisted as it might be, for a man to use his child's blood to stay young.
[01:38:49.660 --> 01:38:52.660]  We're talking about kidnapped children.
[01:38:52.660 --> 01:38:55.660]  We're talking about what are they doing at Epstein Island.
[01:38:55.660 --> 01:39:02.660]  We're talking about the adrenochrome produced by the youth, like some believe Monsters, Inc. is an analogy for.
[01:39:02.660 --> 01:39:08.660]  That is the dark side of this.
[01:39:09.660 --> 01:39:14.660]  Meanwhile, in every Democrat city, violent crime is getting worse and worse.
[01:39:14.660 --> 01:39:20.660]  One dead after shooting on D.C. Metro, less than a quarter mile from Nationals Park.
[01:39:20.660 --> 01:39:24.660]  This trend continues where the Washington Nationals play baseball.
[01:39:24.660 --> 01:39:26.660]  Violent crime happens right down the street.
[01:39:26.660 --> 01:39:28.660]  Sometimes you can hear gunshots during the games.
[01:39:28.660 --> 01:39:30.660]  It's a gun-free zone.
[01:39:30.660 --> 01:39:36.660]  Suspect who fatally shoved man onto Minneapolis light rail released without charges.
[01:39:36.660 --> 01:39:37.660]  That's good.
[01:39:37.660 --> 01:39:38.660]  He'll be right back out on the streets.
[01:39:38.660 --> 01:39:41.660]  He'll shove someone else to their death, and it'll all be fine.
[01:39:41.660 --> 01:39:47.660]  San Francisco mayor's speech on crime interrupted by activists doing a violent crime.
[01:39:47.660 --> 01:39:48.660]  They can't even.
[01:39:48.660 --> 01:39:51.660]  Can you just, can you not do crime while I'm speaking about stopping crime?
[01:39:51.660 --> 01:39:53.660]  Please, just one time.
[01:39:53.660 --> 01:39:54.660]  No.
[01:39:54.660 --> 01:39:59.660]  Seattle struggles to hire more police officers as 9-11 response times increase.
[01:39:59.660 --> 01:40:04.660]  Well, gee, who would want to be a police officer these days?
[01:40:04.660 --> 01:40:09.660]  When you know the media hates you, the Democrat Party hates you,
[01:40:09.660 --> 01:40:12.660]  the city you're in is probably run by Democrats that hate you,
[01:40:12.660 --> 01:40:21.660]  and they put a target on your back for an ambush for a violent crime to be committed against you.
[01:40:21.660 --> 01:40:25.660]  But then if you actually try to do your job and something goes wrong, you're going to jail.
[01:40:25.660 --> 01:40:28.660]  You're going to be destroyed the rest of your life.
[01:40:28.660 --> 01:40:31.660]  So am I surprised people don't want to be police officers anymore?
[01:40:31.660 --> 01:40:33.660]  No.
[01:40:33.660 --> 01:40:35.660]  No.
[01:40:35.660 --> 01:40:36.660]  Democrats got it all figured out, though.
[01:40:36.660 --> 01:40:39.660]  You can see how well it's going in their cities.
[01:40:39.660 --> 01:40:41.660]  Like, or California, their states.
[01:40:41.660 --> 01:40:46.660]  State Farm will no longer accept new applications for California property insurance
[01:40:46.660 --> 01:40:49.660]  due to wildfires, inflation, and historic construction costs.
[01:40:49.660 --> 01:40:50.660]  They're just leaving.
[01:40:50.660 --> 01:40:52.660]  They're just done.
[01:40:52.660 --> 01:40:56.660]  Many brick-and-mortar stores just leaving, just done with California.
[01:40:56.660 --> 01:40:59.660]  Can't keep up with the cost to operate there, the taxes.
[01:41:00.660 --> 01:41:04.660]  Can't keep up with the amount of theft that goes on.
[01:41:04.660 --> 01:41:06.660]  That's what commies do.
[01:41:06.660 --> 01:41:07.660]  They shut you down.
[01:41:07.660 --> 01:41:14.660]  Another San Francisco retailer closes Old Navy to shut down flagship location after almost 30 years.
[01:41:14.660 --> 01:41:16.660]  Shut it down.
[01:41:16.660 --> 01:41:18.660]  That should be the real Democrat slogan.
[01:41:18.660 --> 01:41:20.660]  Shut it down.
[01:41:20.660 --> 01:41:21.660]  That's a nice business you have there.
[01:41:21.660 --> 01:41:23.660]  Shut it down.
[01:41:23.660 --> 01:41:25.660]  That's a nice city you have there.
[01:41:25.660 --> 01:41:28.660]  Shut it down.
[01:41:29.660 --> 01:41:31.660]  That's a nice school you have there.
[01:41:31.660 --> 01:41:34.660]  Shut it down and let the illegal immigrants take it.
[01:41:34.660 --> 01:41:39.660]  Lululemon employees say they were fired for calling 911 on looters ransacking store.
[01:41:39.660 --> 01:41:43.660]  And there's a video of this.
[01:41:43.660 --> 01:41:49.660]  And the person is filming as about three or four young gentlemen, you know, the scholarly type,
[01:41:49.660 --> 01:41:53.660]  are robbing this Lululemon for thousands of dollars in merchandise.
[01:41:53.660 --> 01:41:56.660]  And so the workers are just filming it.
[01:41:56.660 --> 01:41:58.660]  They don't even get confrontational physically.
[01:41:58.660 --> 01:42:00.660]  They're just filming it and then call the police.
[01:42:00.660 --> 01:42:01.660]  And they get fired.
[01:42:01.660 --> 01:42:04.660]  And then Lululemon releases a statement.
[01:42:04.660 --> 01:42:07.660]  This is the most batty part of it all.
[01:42:07.660 --> 01:42:08.660]  So they get fired.
[01:42:08.660 --> 01:42:15.660]  Lululemon issues a statement in response to firing the employees that tried to stop crime theft in their store.
[01:42:15.660 --> 01:42:22.660]  And Lululemon's statement is, we have policies to keep our stores safe.
[01:42:22.660 --> 01:42:23.660]  What?
[01:42:23.660 --> 01:42:30.660]  So allowing criminals to run rampant in your store, that's the policy to keep it safe?
[01:42:30.660 --> 01:42:31.660]  Let me guess.
[01:42:31.660 --> 01:42:34.660]  You've probably got a gun-free zone in front of the storefront as well.
[01:42:34.660 --> 01:42:37.660]  That's how you keep your employees safe?
[01:42:37.660 --> 01:42:39.660]  That's how you keep your customers safe?
[01:42:39.660 --> 01:42:43.660]  By saying, we let criminals come in here and steal stuff?
[01:42:43.660 --> 01:42:45.660]  And by the way, you can't have a gun to protect yourself?
[01:42:45.660 --> 01:42:49.660]  And Lululemon says, this is how we keep our customers and staff safe.
[01:42:49.660 --> 01:42:50.660]  Lululemon.
[01:42:50.660 --> 01:42:53.660]  They should just give that whole company over to criminals at this point.
[01:42:53.660 --> 01:42:54.660]  I mean, come on.
[01:42:54.660 --> 01:42:55.660]  That would be the safe option.
[01:43:19.660 --> 01:43:24.660]  Most iodine in the environment is bound to other elements so your body can't absorb it.
[01:43:24.660 --> 01:43:29.660]  Only pure iodine can really be absorbed right into the cells.
[01:43:29.660 --> 01:43:36.660]  And Infowarestore.com has the only iodine out there that actually has this type of full effect.
[01:43:36.660 --> 01:43:39.660]  Ladies and gentlemen, X3 has been sold out for six months.
[01:43:39.660 --> 01:43:40.660]  It's very hard to produce.
[01:43:40.660 --> 01:43:42.660]  And it's finally back in stock.
[01:43:42.660 --> 01:43:45.660]  In fact, I was just taking some before I shot this ad.
[01:43:45.660 --> 01:43:47.660]  This, ladies and gentlemen, is powerful.
[01:43:47.660 --> 01:43:48.660]  You and your family need it.
[01:43:48.660 --> 01:43:50.660]  It's 25 percent off back in stock.
[01:43:50.660 --> 01:43:51.660]  X3.
[01:43:51.660 --> 01:43:55.660]  Try iodine exclusively at Infowarestore.com.
[01:43:55.660 --> 01:43:56.660]  Take action now.
[01:43:56.660 --> 01:43:58.660]  But regardless, research is info.
[01:43:58.660 --> 01:44:02.660]  Thousands of former Nazis went to work for the United States government.
[01:44:02.660 --> 01:44:06.660]  A flying disc has been found and is now in the possession of the army.
[01:44:06.660 --> 01:44:08.660]  Here is a bulletin from CBS News.
[01:44:08.660 --> 01:44:10.660]  President Kennedy has been shot.
[01:44:10.660 --> 01:44:14.660]  This is a different kind of war.
[01:44:14.660 --> 01:44:18.660]  The USS Liberty had just been attacked by Israeli jets and torpedo boats.
[01:44:18.660 --> 01:44:22.660]  It's a CIA that manipulates the news in the United States.
[01:44:22.660 --> 01:44:26.660]  They took the babies out of incubators and left the children to die on the cold floor.
[01:44:26.660 --> 01:44:30.660]  It was almost as if there were a plan, in quotes, to get John Kennedy.
[01:44:30.660 --> 01:44:32.660]  We need to go into the capital.
[01:44:32.660 --> 01:44:33.660]  Set.
[01:44:33.660 --> 01:44:34.660]  Set.
[01:44:34.660 --> 01:44:35.660]  Set.
[01:44:35.660 --> 01:44:36.660]  You will always have conspiracy theories.
[01:44:36.660 --> 01:44:38.660]  They are nothing but distraction.
[01:44:38.660 --> 01:44:40.660]  You guys censored Harvard-educated doctors.
[01:44:40.660 --> 01:44:42.660]  You silenced those voices.
[01:44:42.660 --> 01:44:46.660]  What we want to do in Davos is push the reset button.
[01:44:46.660 --> 01:44:53.660]  As soon as we start exposing the Great Reset, as soon as these plumbers start going to prison.
[01:44:59.660 --> 01:45:02.660]  I talk a lot about the great successes Infowars has had.
[01:45:02.660 --> 01:45:04.660]  I don't think anybody can deny it.
[01:45:04.660 --> 01:45:08.660]  And it is because of listeners and viewers supporting us.
[01:45:08.660 --> 01:45:10.660]  When we talk about the crew at Infowars,
[01:45:10.660 --> 01:45:13.660]  people behind the scenes, the researchers, the writers,
[01:45:13.660 --> 01:45:17.660]  they really have been the MVPs in this fight.
[01:45:17.660 --> 01:45:22.660]  And we look at Harrison Smith and Owen Schroer and the hard work they engage in every day,
[01:45:22.660 --> 01:45:24.660]  five, six, seven days a week.
[01:45:24.660 --> 01:45:26.660]  It's really just incredible.
[01:45:26.660 --> 01:45:30.660]  So for myself and the whole Infowars crew, I thank you for your past support.
[01:45:30.660 --> 01:45:36.660]  I only encourage you now to realize that Infowars cannot stay on air if you do not support us.
[01:45:36.660 --> 01:45:37.660]  I know you spread the word.
[01:45:37.660 --> 01:45:38.660]  I know you pray for us.
[01:45:38.660 --> 01:45:39.660]  And that's wonderful.
[01:45:39.660 --> 01:45:42.660]  Most viewers and listeners never go to InfowarsStore.com
[01:45:42.660 --> 01:45:45.660]  and you never buy great products that enrich and empower your life
[01:45:45.660 --> 01:45:47.660]  while at the same time keeping us on air.
[01:45:47.660 --> 01:45:51.660]  I know that less than 1% of our listeners actually go buy products at InfowarsStore.com.
[01:45:51.660 --> 01:45:55.660]  If just 1% more of you took action and went to InfowarsStore.com,
[01:45:55.660 --> 01:45:57.660]  our funding problems will be over.
[01:45:57.660 --> 01:45:58.660]  Please take action now.
[01:45:58.660 --> 01:46:01.660]  Ladies and gentlemen, this book, The Great Reset and War for the World,
[01:46:01.660 --> 01:46:04.660]  is a historic book that documents the globe in our own words,
[01:46:04.660 --> 01:46:06.660]  planned for our future.
[01:46:06.660 --> 01:46:07.660]  That is the hellish future.
[01:46:08.660 --> 01:46:11.660]  Now you'll always, while they still allow books, I guess they're starting to ban them,
[01:46:11.660 --> 01:46:14.660]  be able to get an unsigned copy of The Great Reset and War for the World
[01:46:14.660 --> 01:46:17.660]  at bookstores, Amazon, or InfowarsStore.com.
[01:46:17.660 --> 01:46:20.660]  But you will never be able to get another signed copy of the book
[01:46:20.660 --> 01:46:23.660]  after the signed copies we got run out.
[01:46:23.660 --> 01:46:25.660]  And there's about 1,000 left of them right now.
[01:46:25.660 --> 01:46:28.660]  So get your copy of The Great Reset and the War for the World,
[01:46:28.660 --> 01:46:31.660]  a signed copy, at InfowarsStore.com.
[01:46:31.660 --> 01:46:35.660]  And there is a markup there because this is a fundraiser to keep us on the air.
[01:46:35.660 --> 01:46:38.660]  You won't just have this historic memento and this powerful book,
[01:46:38.660 --> 01:46:41.660]  you'll also know that you help keep Infowars on the air.
[01:46:41.660 --> 01:46:43.660]  I'm going to thank those of you that have gotten signed copies of the book
[01:46:43.660 --> 01:46:47.660]  or unsigned copies, but I want to encourage all of you who haven't yet
[01:46:47.660 --> 01:46:50.660]  to go to InfowarsStore.com and get a signed copy
[01:46:50.660 --> 01:46:53.660]  and buy a couple of unsigned copies and donate them to the library
[01:46:53.660 --> 01:46:55.660]  or give them to the local school.
[01:46:55.660 --> 01:46:58.660]  This is an Infowar, I'm counting on you, and thank you for your support.
[01:46:58.660 --> 01:47:03.660]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order,
[01:47:03.660 --> 01:47:05.660]  it's Alex Jones.
[01:47:06.820 --> 01:47:08.820]  You
[01:47:23.580 --> 01:47:26.139]  That's okay look she's allowed to do anything you want
[01:47:28.099 --> 01:47:30.099]  Kids rule my house, okay
[01:47:31.139 --> 01:47:33.139]  What's the matter?
[01:47:33.580 --> 01:47:35.580]  What's the matter I?
[01:47:35.940 --> 01:47:38.000]  Don't blame you I'm bored with me, too
[01:47:40.660 --> 01:47:42.660]  Boy a lot to unpack here
[01:47:43.099 --> 01:47:45.940]  Lot to unpack there Biden at the White House over the weekend
[01:47:45.940 --> 01:47:50.860]  What what is the story there that he just can't stop with the children and that deal?
[01:47:51.340 --> 01:47:57.280]  Or that he basically admits that his entire presidency is a sham. He's bored with it, too. He doesn't even want to be there
[01:47:57.820 --> 01:48:00.860]  Joe Biden admits he doesn't even want to be president Joe Biden admits
[01:48:00.860 --> 01:48:06.179]  He doesn't even want to be in the White House or is it Joe Biden can't stop going after children that go into the White
[01:48:06.179 --> 01:48:07.420]  House
[01:48:07.420 --> 01:48:09.420]  Well, what is going on at the FBI I?
[01:48:14.139 --> 01:48:16.139]  Mean I you know
[01:48:17.900 --> 01:48:24.160]  Folks the stuff from Hunter Biden's laptop is basically all public now, okay
[01:48:27.259 --> 01:48:29.259]  It's disgusting
[01:48:29.299 --> 01:48:35.540]  It's disgusting you know and it'd be one thing unfortunately I have to stumble upon this every once in a while
[01:48:36.660 --> 01:48:39.420]  You know it's it's one thing when I see the hunter Biden
[01:48:40.059 --> 01:48:42.059]  porn videos
[01:48:43.179 --> 01:48:46.540]  With adults and it's it's him with adults doing stuff
[01:48:47.460 --> 01:48:49.460]  It's another thing when you see
[01:48:49.740 --> 01:48:51.740]  Hunter Biden with what appears to be minors
[01:48:52.900 --> 01:48:54.820]  Doing God knows what?
[01:48:54.820 --> 01:48:56.820]  I'm sure it's all family-friendly though
[01:48:57.299 --> 01:49:00.299]  But it's all out there and it's just like okay, well, I guess just
[01:49:01.740 --> 01:49:03.740]  totally normal
[01:49:03.860 --> 01:49:09.940]  But then you see this and you just scratch your head and you wonder oh is this what the Patriot Front is really all about
[01:49:11.460 --> 01:49:15.500]  Because this is a new Democrat propaganda account and you say well
[01:49:15.500 --> 01:49:18.740]  How do you know it's a Democrat propaganda account because folks these accounts come out of nowhere?
[01:49:19.059 --> 01:49:25.460]  They get a hundred thousand followers overnight, and then they end up on your newsfeed every day, and you don't even follow them
[01:49:26.460 --> 01:49:34.139]  Alejandra Caraballo is the latest she shares this story Patriot Front member pleads guilty to child pornographer charges in Utah
[01:49:34.139 --> 01:49:40.219]  Oh every single time. It's conservatives everything every single time. It's the people going after the LGBTQ. It's them
[01:49:40.219 --> 01:49:43.740]  They're the ones this is projection. This is propaganda and
[01:49:44.900 --> 01:49:48.259]  What is the real story with the Patriot Front nobody seems to know?
[01:49:50.259 --> 01:49:54.340]  Are they feds did a fed from the Patriot Front get caught with child pornography
[01:49:55.580 --> 01:50:01.099]  Was this all just a false flag and run this Patriot Front group out there and then claim. They're all pedophiles to
[01:50:01.940 --> 01:50:05.900]  Project onto the right wing what the LGBTQ plus movement has really become
[01:50:08.099 --> 01:50:12.219]  Are we even allowed to ask these questions anymore
[01:50:13.460 --> 01:50:19.179]  Now boys men. I've got bad news for you here. We were all concerned. We all saw it
[01:50:19.900 --> 01:50:22.660]  Well, maybe not everybody. Maybe I shouldn't even tell you this I
[01:50:23.660 --> 01:50:27.019]  Don't even want to tell you this, but CNN told me this
[01:50:28.540 --> 01:50:33.500]  What to know about body dysmorphia the condition affecting Megan Fox
[01:50:37.139 --> 01:50:39.299]  Wait the rumors weren't true
[01:50:40.420 --> 01:50:42.420]  Couldn't be I'm gonna. I can't
[01:50:43.179 --> 01:50:48.219]  All right, let's go to some phone calls here. Let's loosen up the phone lines for Harrison Smith
[01:50:48.219 --> 01:50:53.059]  He's coming in here hosting Sunday night live the host of the American Journal right here at band video
[01:50:53.179 --> 01:50:58.420]  He's gonna be hosting Sunday night live taking your calls covering other big breaking news stories
[01:50:58.460 --> 01:51:03.900]  So we'll warm up the phone lines for him, and we'll start with Andrew in New York Andrew
[01:51:03.900 --> 01:51:06.219]  You are on the Alex Jones show go ahead
[01:51:12.940 --> 01:51:15.580]  Just love it Andrew, thank you for the call magic
[01:51:16.099 --> 01:51:19.320]  Caller magic, let's go to Anne in
[01:51:20.219 --> 01:51:22.940]  Pennsylvania and you're on the Alex Jones show go ahead
[01:51:23.900 --> 01:51:25.900]  Hello, you're doing a great job
[01:51:26.019 --> 01:51:28.019]  Thank you doing a great job
[01:51:28.460 --> 01:51:32.660]  So Michelle Bachman amazing amazing amazing former congresswoman
[01:51:33.179 --> 01:51:35.179]  So she was laying it out the other day
[01:51:35.980 --> 01:51:37.420]  verbatim
[01:51:37.420 --> 01:51:40.900]  Exactly what the WHO plans to do when they take a vote
[01:51:40.900 --> 01:51:46.059]  I believe it's next May and how convenient the year of the presidential election indeed
[01:51:46.780 --> 01:51:52.139]  She listed everything and it's by the way. They basically already have the vote
[01:51:53.059 --> 01:52:00.179]  Explain that too, but there's still hope she laid out verbatim exactly what they plan to do now
[01:52:00.460 --> 01:52:04.940]  We all know that they want full control over our autonomy
[01:52:05.059 --> 01:52:12.460]  They want to be able to force a jab force mass force lockdowns do everything and you know, honestly
[01:52:12.460 --> 01:52:14.460]  I've been you know, I've been
[01:52:15.340 --> 01:52:17.340]  complaining about Congress and
[01:52:17.740 --> 01:52:21.420]  I for some reason they seem to always get a pass
[01:52:22.059 --> 01:52:27.900]  Why wasn't Marjorie Taylor Greene there? Why wasn't Ted Cruz? These are my favorite people
[01:52:28.580 --> 01:52:30.580]  Okay
[01:52:30.580 --> 01:52:33.059]  I'm sick to my stomach because it's you know
[01:52:33.059 --> 01:52:35.620]  This is the last thing I want to say because I don't want to take too much of your time
[01:52:36.540 --> 01:52:44.099]  These people what they want to do is they want to become they want to pass this thing that even they call a treaty
[01:52:44.860 --> 01:52:47.259]  They want to they want to
[01:52:47.820 --> 01:52:54.460]  Completely erode the United States Constitution. They want to have complete power. We're in America. Yes, and
[01:52:55.139 --> 01:52:57.340]  That's what that was. That was one of the big
[01:52:57.940 --> 01:53:02.099]  That was one of the big agendas with the pandemic is to say oh when you have a pandemic
[01:53:02.099 --> 01:53:07.900]  It's a global thing. You can't act as a nation-state. It's eroding our sovereignty. I'm glad Michelle Bachmann understands it
[01:53:07.900 --> 01:53:11.139]  we need more people to understand that in the media and in Congress and
[01:53:11.940 --> 01:53:13.940]  it's just it's just
[01:53:15.460 --> 01:53:20.820]  Look I will I will say I'll play excuse maker if you will for Marjorie Taylor Greene Ted Cruz and the others
[01:53:20.860 --> 01:53:25.500]  There's so many things they're dealing with right now in Congress. I'm not justifying this if you listen to me, you know
[01:53:25.500 --> 01:53:31.620]  I've given them C's Marjorie Taylor Greene might be the best congresswoman. She gets a C grade. She's she's average
[01:53:31.620 --> 01:53:37.780]  She's what our average congresswoman congressman should be like she'd get an A if she's doing exactly what you're talking about
[01:53:37.780 --> 01:53:42.000]  But they got so many different things. They're juggling. They're trying to expose the Biden crime family
[01:53:42.000 --> 01:53:45.360]  They're dealing with the border and all kinds of different things. But so it's a C effort
[01:53:47.259 --> 01:53:52.120]  But I'm glad the issue is being talked about we at least have till next May it sounds like to do something
[01:53:52.120 --> 01:53:56.719]  Thanks to the call and let's go to Michael in Texas Michael. You're on the air. Go ahead
[01:53:57.719 --> 01:54:01.880]  Owen Owen we have spoken once before I am
[01:54:03.000 --> 01:54:07.000]  I've been an info warrior since 2008 and I'm extremely
[01:54:07.759 --> 01:54:15.480]  Disappointed at the pandering that you and Alex do with Trump and I'm glad you mentioned MTG
[01:54:16.639 --> 01:54:22.799]  one of the ramifications of this debt ceiling deal and you know what we might as well have left Nancy Pelosi in a
[01:54:23.040 --> 01:54:25.040]  Speaker of the house and by the way
[01:54:25.320 --> 01:54:30.719]  MTG was the first one to break from the Freedom Caucus and endorse this McCarthy character
[01:54:30.719 --> 01:54:33.840]  You might as well to put in here. You change your name to Kevin
[01:54:34.719 --> 01:54:40.759]  Romney for crying out loud. I mean the guy's a Democrat and you might as well, right? So here's the biggest ramifications
[01:54:41.240 --> 01:54:47.240]  They're killing the student loan moratorium. Oh, and this is gonna put millions of
[01:54:47.920 --> 01:54:52.160]  Americans in the fall think what that's gonna do
[01:54:52.799 --> 01:54:54.400]  to the economy
[01:54:54.400 --> 01:55:01.160]  When millions have that on the credit report trying to get a home trying to get a car think about that
[01:55:01.400 --> 01:55:04.880]  So what so you want the student debt forgiveness?
[01:55:06.519 --> 01:55:13.080]  Absolutely, absolutely because you're not and I know your feelings on that but absolutely if we could send
[01:55:13.759 --> 01:55:15.519]  billions of dollars
[01:55:15.519 --> 01:55:21.980]  Every year to all these different countries around the world now now does not see now that's a totally different argument now
[01:55:21.980 --> 01:55:28.420]  I understand why you connect the two issues and it's fair enough, but you have to understand spending all the money overseas
[01:55:28.980 --> 01:55:32.460]  Does not equate to let's pay off Americans debts
[01:55:33.139 --> 01:55:34.820]  domestically
[01:55:34.820 --> 01:55:40.059]  Like I agree. Let's stop all the international spending you want to sit here and talk to me out government health care
[01:55:40.059 --> 01:55:44.379]  Any of this crap don't say a damn word to me until you stop foreign spending
[01:55:44.379 --> 01:55:50.780]  I completely agree with that but just stopping foreign aid doesn't mean we start enacting communist policies domestically
[01:55:51.379 --> 01:55:54.460]  Well, well, let me draw the hypocrisy
[01:55:55.139 --> 01:56:00.660]  Because I guess nobody had a problem with with that PPP forgiveness
[01:56:01.299 --> 01:56:06.059]  MPG I've seen reports up to a hundred and eighty four thousand dollars in
[01:56:06.860 --> 01:56:14.780]  100% forgiveness and she goes out and buys a six hundred thousand dollar plus apartment in Washington District of Criminals
[01:56:14.780 --> 01:56:18.580]  I've seen reports from that case got up to a half a million
[01:56:19.340 --> 01:56:24.900]  Forgiven but John Smith who's making $18 an hour who tried to better himself
[01:56:25.219 --> 01:56:32.500]  But between the government and the corporations screwing his career, so he can't get 10 grand forgiven
[01:56:32.500 --> 01:56:34.500]  He's gonna go into the false
[01:56:34.900 --> 01:56:42.019]  So if he's a renter and he needs to rent a new home and he's denied he winds up in a long-term hotel
[01:56:42.379 --> 01:56:46.700]  Which are disgusting or he sits in his car. I want to sustain
[01:56:47.379 --> 01:56:49.379]  Equivalent it's the same
[01:56:49.540 --> 01:56:53.019]  Hypocrisy and we've got all the money in the world as you mentioned earlier
[01:56:53.740 --> 01:57:00.059]  You know about the the illegals getting hotels and our armed service men and women getting kicked out
[01:57:00.179 --> 01:57:04.700]  It's the same hypocrisy my friend and that's the problem I had
[01:57:05.500 --> 01:57:09.099]  They can do for themselves and nobody bats an eye
[01:57:09.660 --> 01:57:14.460]  But boy do something for Johnny and Jane American and we spit on it
[01:57:14.460 --> 01:57:19.059]  It makes no sense to me and another thing about MCG
[01:57:19.420 --> 01:57:24.580]  Again, I don't like the fact that she goes on with Alex Jones last week or two weeks ago
[01:57:24.580 --> 01:57:28.019]  Whatever it was and she talked about this impeachment thing
[01:57:28.660 --> 01:57:34.460]  She and Alex doesn't explain the process that it'll die in the Senate
[01:57:34.460 --> 01:57:39.139]  You'll never get sixty seven. All right, Michael. Well, this is why we open up the lines
[01:57:39.139 --> 01:57:41.139]  We want to hear from everybody fair points made
[01:57:41.219 --> 01:57:46.099]  That's it for me tonight on the Alex Jones show Harrison Smith taking over but stay on that line he'll take your call
