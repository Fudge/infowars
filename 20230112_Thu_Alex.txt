[00:00.000 --> 00:04.960]  The anniversary of January 6 has come and gone, but it's turning out to be a holiday
[00:04.960 --> 00:07.040]  of propaganda for the state.
[00:07.040 --> 00:12.560]  A day to celebrate lie upon lie in the corrupt Washington, D.C. establishment's gaslighting
[00:12.560 --> 00:13.560]  of America.
[00:13.560 --> 00:21.080]  As a result of the events on January 6, the lives of five heroic officers were lost.
[00:21.080 --> 00:26.000]  Brian Sicknick was a U.S. Capitol police officer devoted to serving our nation.
[00:26.000 --> 00:29.560]  He lost his life protecting our elected representatives.
[00:29.560 --> 00:33.040]  No police officers were killed on January 6, period.
[00:33.040 --> 00:35.600]  Ashley Babbit was killed on January 6.
[00:35.600 --> 00:39.760]  Two years later, the real evidence is still hidden from public view.
[00:39.760 --> 00:46.760]  Based on what I saw and observed in the video clip, Ashley Babbit was murdered.
[00:46.760 --> 00:51.840]  She was shot and killed under color of authority by an officer who violated not only the law
[00:51.840 --> 00:55.520]  but his oath and committed an arrestable offense.
[00:55.520 --> 01:01.480]  Victoria White from Rochester, Minnesota with the crowd had come up to the tunnel entrance
[01:01.480 --> 01:07.760]  and she says she had been pushed in by the momentum of the crowd and she ended up being
[01:07.760 --> 01:09.640]  trapped against one of the walls.
[01:09.640 --> 01:16.400]  In fairly short time after she got in there, she was attacked by a police officer, a supervisor
[01:16.400 --> 01:22.120]  from the Metro D.C. police department and it went on for maybe five minutes.
[01:22.120 --> 01:25.480]  She was struck nearly 40 times in the head and face.
[01:25.480 --> 01:31.480]  It is definitely a crime that was committed by Officer Morris when she struck a downed
[01:31.480 --> 01:32.480]  person.
[01:32.480 --> 01:38.640]  She was seriously attempting to injure Roseanne Boylan by striking her.
[01:38.640 --> 01:40.200]  But they pulled her into the Capitol.
[01:40.200 --> 01:44.320]  Then she did receive emergency care and I think heroic care.
[01:44.320 --> 01:46.920]  The officers that were inside didn't hesitate.
[01:46.920 --> 01:50.080]  Unfortunately, we're pretty sure she was deceased by that time.
[01:50.080 --> 01:55.560]  The Capitol Police, per their own timeline, received the authorization request from the
[01:55.560 --> 01:59.200]  Department of Defense where I was Chief of Staff for National Guards, men and women before
[01:59.200 --> 02:00.200]  January 6th.
[02:00.200 --> 02:05.320]  The Capitol Police then went to the Sergeant and Arms in the House and the Senate and the
[02:05.320 --> 02:10.360]  Chief of Police and the decision was made pursuant to their own timeline that that request
[02:10.360 --> 02:11.360]  would be declined.
[02:11.360 --> 02:16.160]  And key players in the stage insurrection with ties to the federal government and its
[02:16.160 --> 02:19.400]  mockingbird media arm are still walking free.
[02:19.400 --> 02:24.800]  The names Ray Epps, Megan Paradise, Luke Phillips, John Sullivan, Sullivan's brother
[02:24.800 --> 02:30.200]  James turned John into the FBI after he had previously been released.
[02:30.200 --> 02:35.400]  James explained to the FBI that he believed his brother was not only involved in the riots
[02:35.400 --> 02:41.040]  at the U.S. Capitol but was somehow in charge of the breach into the U.S. Capitol.
[02:41.040 --> 02:47.240]  That populist counter-revolution propagandized as far-right extremism has been spreading
[02:47.240 --> 02:53.280]  worldwide for years, just as the O. Biden administration's totalitarianism is spreading
[02:53.280 --> 02:58.320]  to world leaders as it's propagandized as homeland security.
[02:58.320 --> 03:03.240]  The overwhelming majority of people in Brazil know that the recent presidential election
[03:03.240 --> 03:08.840]  was stolen by the convicted criminal President Lula, convicted of corruption roughly six
[03:08.840 --> 03:09.840]  years ago.
[03:09.840 --> 03:16.400]  And President Lula is actually a convicted felon for bribery as well as being a socialist.
[03:16.400 --> 03:20.760]  So you have half the country that feels severely disenfranchised.
[03:20.760 --> 03:22.960]  This election had no transparency.
[03:22.960 --> 03:28.960]  So the protesters who protested for the last 70 days peacefully, no arson, no violence,
[03:28.960 --> 03:33.360]  just wanted a evidence proof that this was an honest election.
[03:33.360 --> 03:37.800]  Now it turns out, as the plot usually does thicken in these situations, that there were
[03:37.800 --> 03:44.720]  many an agent provocateur yesterday at these buildings and doing incredible gross damage
[03:44.720 --> 03:50.240]  breaking windows and such, and it looks like this is turning into a Reichstag fire and
[03:50.240 --> 03:53.880]  being used to clamp down on these democratic protests.
[03:53.880 --> 04:00.440]  Mirroring the aftermath of January 6, Lula is of course blaming former President Bolsonaro,
[04:00.440 --> 04:06.240]  calling him a genocideist that encouraged the protesters who swarmed all three branches
[04:06.240 --> 04:07.240]  of government.
[04:07.240 --> 04:12.480]  Back here in the United States, the audacity of the arrest of Ashley Babbit's mother, who
[04:12.480 --> 04:19.080]  was simply honoring her daughter who was murdered by the state with no charges filed, continues
[04:19.080 --> 04:24.960]  to spotlight the O.Biden administration's road to tyranny, the right to protest.
[04:24.960 --> 04:31.440]  As it is deemed in our Constitution, clearly belongs to one class of people in America,
[04:31.440 --> 04:33.200]  and it ain't most of us.
[04:33.200 --> 04:39.320]  We came here to the Trump International Hotel to remind those agos that stormed the Capitol
[04:39.320 --> 04:52.120]  that they're still ugly, and we're reminding them with just how hot we are.
[04:52.120 --> 04:57.760]  The establishment, without a shred of doubt, are precisely the people the founders warned
[04:57.760 --> 05:01.320]  us about, and they know it.
[05:01.320 --> 05:05.640]  Everyone watching should realize that this is an information war, and it takes money
[05:05.640 --> 05:10.720]  to fund an information war, and everyone should decide to take the fight to the next level
[05:10.720 --> 05:14.680]  and to take the fight to the very tip of the spear and ensure we stand the field in this
[05:14.680 --> 05:20.080]  war against the New World War by visiting infowarstore.com right now and taking action.
[05:20.080 --> 05:23.880]  I thank you for your past support, and I ask you now to count the cost and realize that
[05:23.880 --> 05:28.600]  only your commitment to keep Info Wars on the air will ensure our victory against the
[05:28.600 --> 05:29.600]  New World War.
[05:29.600 --> 05:33.520]  They're coming for you and your family, they're coming for me, they're coming for the children,
[05:33.520 --> 05:36.080]  but to get to the children, they've got to get through us first.
[05:36.080 --> 05:39.320]  These monsters are all over television wanting to give these shots to newborn babies.
[05:39.320 --> 05:43.520]  They're already given to the pregnant women, miscarriages are off the chart, 80-plus percent
[05:43.520 --> 05:48.480]  increase in miscarriages in the first two prime ministers after these poison shots.
[05:48.480 --> 05:52.480]  We can and will save the children, and they are counting on us.
[05:52.480 --> 05:57.080]  Let's do it together, and the fight starts at infowars.com, and the fight continues with
[05:57.080 --> 05:59.720]  your financial support at infowarstore.com.
[05:59.720 --> 06:04.480]  Now take action now.
[06:04.480 --> 06:11.040]  You are listening to an infowars.com frontline report.
[06:11.040 --> 06:22.680]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[06:22.680 --> 06:31.280]  Live in the heart of FEMA Region 6, Austin, Texas, transmitting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[06:31.280 --> 06:35.800]  MTG is set to join us coming up in the next segment.
[06:35.800 --> 06:39.200]  Criminal investigations are being launched around the world about the poison shots.
[06:39.200 --> 06:43.440]  Now the FDA has released the documents admitting it's causing mass heart attacks and cardiovascular
[06:43.440 --> 06:44.440]  crises.
[06:44.440 --> 06:47.000]  Here's a promo Joe Rogan sent me yesterday.
[06:47.000 --> 06:51.000]  It's a little satire piece, but it's very, very sick when you realize how real this
[06:51.000 --> 06:52.000]  is.
[06:52.000 --> 06:58.360]  You're suffering from a medical coincidence.
[06:58.360 --> 07:03.760]  Are you or a loved one suffering from a medical coincidence?
[07:03.760 --> 07:07.440]  You want proper medical care, but you don't want people sniffing around asking a whole
[07:07.440 --> 07:11.040]  bunch of questions about what might be causing your problem.
[07:11.040 --> 07:15.080]  At the Kaufman Institute for Coincidence, we won't look into the cause of your heart
[07:15.080 --> 07:16.080]  or other problem.
[07:16.080 --> 07:17.080]  We'll just fix it.
[07:17.080 --> 07:18.320]  That's right.
[07:18.320 --> 07:20.720]  We promise to only look at your symptoms.
[07:20.720 --> 07:24.520]  You won't get all curious looking for causes, because that could get your employer or your
[07:24.520 --> 07:28.400]  doctor into some legal hot water, and nobody wants that.
[07:28.400 --> 07:33.240]  At Kaufman, we understand that coincidence is now the leading cause of death.
[07:33.240 --> 07:35.880]  Hey, we've got another coincidence over here.
[07:35.880 --> 07:40.720]  If we want to operate at the speed of science, there's no time for looking for causes.
[07:40.720 --> 07:44.200]  No pesky questions about drugs or vaccines you may have been given.
[07:44.200 --> 07:49.320]  At Kaufman, we specialize in the effects and leave the causes to the conspiracy theorists.
[07:49.320 --> 07:52.480]  And let's be honest, we know the cause anyway.
[07:52.480 --> 07:54.840]  It was a coincidence, right?
[07:54.840 --> 07:59.320]  For each new patient, Kaufman's talented team of doctors strap on their blinders and
[07:59.320 --> 08:05.160]  look directly at the problem area, usually the heart, just like the CDC recommends.
[08:05.160 --> 08:12.000]  Our main campus now treats myocarditis, blood clots, heart arrhythmia, stroke, heart attack,
[08:12.000 --> 08:17.240]  magnetic skin, difficulty breathing, full body blisters and burning, convulsions, kidney
[08:17.240 --> 08:22.320]  failure, memory loss, cancer, sudden death and much, much more.
[08:22.320 --> 08:26.880]  Give your coincidence the attention it deserves, but not the wrong kind of attention.
[08:26.880 --> 08:32.320]  At Kaufman, schedule your appointment today at Kaufmancoincidence.com and receive a doctor's
[08:32.320 --> 08:37.120]  note with a real sciencey sounding explanation to provide to your anti-vax friends, proving
[08:37.120 --> 08:41.920]  to them it was definitely not the vaccine that caused your coincidence.
[08:41.920 --> 08:52.160]  Kaufman, because coincidence has happened pretty much all the time.
[08:52.160 --> 09:00.280]  And those coincidences are killing an extra 13% death rate compared to the years previous.
[09:00.280 --> 09:06.600]  The highest increase in death rate in the planet's ever seen by massive numbers.
[09:06.600 --> 09:12.440]  Thank you for joining us on this live Thursday, January 12 transmission.
[09:12.440 --> 09:17.360]  MTG's been scheduled twice this week, but had to move it, there's all the voting going
[09:17.360 --> 09:22.680]  on, but they're set to let out Congress early in just the next few minutes.
[09:22.680 --> 09:24.640]  She should be on with us a little bit later.
[09:24.640 --> 09:30.320]  In the hour, she's calling for criminal investigations and criminal hearings into the criminal launch
[09:30.320 --> 09:36.240]  of this bio weapon and the gain of function and the origin of the virus in the Fauci Bill
[09:36.240 --> 09:41.720]  Gates, Peter Dazza-Glabs, we're going to be drilling through all that with her coming
[09:41.720 --> 09:45.080]  up in so much more.
[09:45.080 --> 09:52.840]  The FDA got a law passed in December, no more animal testing, and I told you that was coming.
[09:52.840 --> 09:57.680]  They'll just take drugs directly to market, including these poison shots, and then it's
[09:57.680 --> 10:04.040]  all a coincidence because no studies are done, no studies will be done by the government
[10:04.040 --> 10:08.640]  corporations and they think the media will then just cover it up.
[10:08.640 --> 10:11.680]  This is mass depopulation.
[10:11.680 --> 10:15.680]  Then we have another big piece of legislation, 210 Democrats voting against Bill requiring
[10:15.680 --> 10:20.680]  medical care for babies born alive after an abortion attempt.
[10:20.680 --> 10:25.960]  So in fantasy that they're pushing to basically keep legal, they've been doing it by fiat,
[10:25.960 --> 10:27.320]  that's all coming up.
[10:27.320 --> 10:33.280]  Huge news on the economy, huge news on the military front, huge news on the Uvaldi shooting
[10:33.280 --> 10:41.440]  front, massive news on the imminent announcement of banning gas stoves, and more.
[10:41.440 --> 10:44.640]  New York Center does legislation to do it, Biden's moving forward with it, this is the
[10:44.640 --> 10:48.360]  total shut off of all of our industry and siege.
[10:48.360 --> 10:49.360]  That's coming up.
[10:49.360 --> 10:54.160]  But first, Harrison Smith's done it again, the full video is on infowars.com.
[10:54.160 --> 10:56.400]  Watch the Ukraine Warpitch meeting.
[10:56.400 --> 10:57.400]  Here it is.
[10:57.400 --> 11:01.800]  What are you doing over there?
[11:01.800 --> 11:02.800]  What?
[11:02.800 --> 11:03.800]  Nothing.
[11:03.800 --> 11:04.800]  What?
[11:04.800 --> 11:05.800]  Where?
[11:05.800 --> 11:06.800]  In Ukraine.
[11:06.800 --> 11:07.800]  What are you up to?
[11:07.800 --> 11:08.800]  Ukraine?
[11:08.800 --> 11:09.800]  What?
[11:09.800 --> 11:10.800]  Ukraine?
[11:10.800 --> 11:11.800]  Nothing's happening in Ukraine.
[11:11.800 --> 11:12.800]  Ukraine of all places.
[11:12.800 --> 11:14.280]  Where do you get this stuff?
[11:14.280 --> 11:18.320]  No, it looks like there's some sort of NATO expansion and a CIA-backed coup and something
[11:18.320 --> 11:20.160]  about Joe Biden withholding a billion dollars.
[11:20.160 --> 11:21.160]  Want to get impeached?
[11:21.160 --> 11:22.160]  Impeached?
[11:22.160 --> 11:24.000]  You can't impeach me.
[11:24.000 --> 11:25.560]  In that case, just shut up.
[11:25.560 --> 11:26.840]  No, no, I'm not kidding.
[11:26.840 --> 11:29.040]  It looks like Russia is massing on the border.
[11:29.040 --> 11:30.040]  Well, it's fine.
[11:30.040 --> 11:31.240]  We're sending Anthony Blinken over there.
[11:31.240 --> 11:32.480]  Oh, to prevent a war?
[11:32.480 --> 11:33.480]  No.
[11:33.480 --> 11:34.480]  Okay.
[11:34.480 --> 11:35.480]  Well, what's he doing?
[11:35.480 --> 11:37.480]  He's going over to protect democracy.
[11:37.480 --> 11:38.480]  Oh, democracy.
[11:38.480 --> 11:40.400]  I love that word.
[11:40.400 --> 11:41.400]  Terrible news.
[11:41.400 --> 11:42.800]  Oh, no.
[11:42.800 --> 11:44.000]  Russia invaded Ukraine.
[11:44.000 --> 11:45.000]  Oh, no.
[11:45.000 --> 11:46.000]  Why?
[11:46.000 --> 11:48.520]  Well, because Putin is evil.
[11:48.520 --> 11:49.880]  Because Putin is evil?
[11:49.880 --> 11:50.880]  Putin evil?
[11:50.880 --> 11:51.880]  Zelensky good.
[11:51.880 --> 11:52.880]  That about sums it up.
[11:52.880 --> 11:53.880]  Okay.
[11:53.880 --> 11:56.800]  So the largest country in the world decided to invade a country the size of Texas, and
[11:56.800 --> 12:00.600]  the only reason you're giving me is Putin evil, big country, little country.
[12:00.600 --> 12:01.600]  You get it.
[12:01.600 --> 12:02.600]  I'm confused.
[12:02.600 --> 12:07.840]  Well, you don't like the fact that a bigger country invaded a smaller country, do you?
[12:07.840 --> 12:08.840]  No.
[12:08.840 --> 12:09.840]  I mean, I guess not.
[12:09.840 --> 12:10.840]  Great.
[12:10.840 --> 12:11.840]  You're fully on board.
[12:11.840 --> 12:12.840]  Here's a Ukrainian flag.
[12:12.840 --> 12:13.840]  Hey, have you heard about the ghost of Kiev?
[12:13.840 --> 12:15.280]  He's this lone fighter pilot.
[12:15.280 --> 12:16.280]  It's protecting the whole city.
[12:16.280 --> 12:18.400]  He's already downed like six Russian airplanes.
[12:18.400 --> 12:19.400]  It's incredible.
[12:19.400 --> 12:20.400]  Whoa, really?
[12:20.400 --> 12:21.400]  No.
[12:21.400 --> 12:22.400]  No.
[12:22.400 --> 12:23.880]  But there are these guys on Snake Island.
[12:23.880 --> 12:27.840]  When the Russians demanded they surrender, they responded, go fuck yourself.
[12:27.840 --> 12:29.400]  It's awesome.
[12:29.400 --> 12:30.880]  Whoa, really?
[12:30.880 --> 12:31.880]  No.
[12:31.880 --> 12:33.600]  No, that didn't happen either.
[12:33.600 --> 12:35.840]  But did you hear about the Russian atrocities?
[12:35.840 --> 12:38.240]  They are committing war crimes against children.
[12:38.240 --> 12:40.400]  Oh my God, really?
[12:40.400 --> 12:41.400]  Nope.
[12:41.400 --> 12:43.480]  But it doesn't matter because we have to defend Ukraine.
[12:43.480 --> 12:45.400]  They are our military ally.
[12:45.400 --> 12:47.800]  I don't actually think they are.
[12:47.800 --> 12:48.800]  Yeah.
[12:48.800 --> 12:51.840]  Well, we're going to do it anyway because after all, we've got to defend democracy.
[12:51.840 --> 12:52.840]  Okay.
[12:52.840 --> 12:53.840]  So what are we doing to help?
[12:53.840 --> 12:54.840]  I mean, can we mediate?
[12:54.840 --> 12:55.840]  We can call for peace.
[12:55.840 --> 12:58.240]  How many zeros is in 100 billion?
[12:58.240 --> 13:00.720]  You're writing them a hundred billion dollar check?
[13:00.720 --> 13:01.720]  Yeah.
[13:01.720 --> 13:04.840]  I mean, I was writing checks in the tens of millions, but I was running out of check.
[13:04.840 --> 13:06.160]  So I'll just do one big one.
[13:06.160 --> 13:07.360]  How much have you sent them?
[13:07.360 --> 13:09.160]  You mean how much have you sent them?
[13:09.160 --> 13:10.160]  No idea.
[13:10.160 --> 13:11.160]  Literally impossible to know.
[13:11.160 --> 13:12.160]  Okay.
[13:12.160 --> 13:13.160]  Well, where's it all going?
[13:13.160 --> 13:14.160]  Again, who knows?
[13:14.160 --> 13:17.560]  Up in smoke or whatever bombs do.
[13:17.560 --> 13:18.560]  Okay.
[13:18.560 --> 13:19.560]  That's so much money.
[13:19.560 --> 13:22.560]  Has there even been an official declaration of war yet?
[13:22.560 --> 13:23.560]  A what?
[13:23.560 --> 13:25.720]  I've never even heard of that.
[13:25.720 --> 13:27.920]  No, there was a declaration that Putin is evil.
[13:27.920 --> 13:29.280]  For sure you heard me.
[13:29.280 --> 13:32.080]  Yeah, I don't know if I'm really convinced that Putin is evil.
[13:32.080 --> 13:33.720]  Well, of course Putin is evil.
[13:33.720 --> 13:37.720]  I mean, if he's not evil, why would he drive our gas prices up so high?
[13:37.720 --> 13:39.480]  Putin drove our gas prices up?
[13:39.480 --> 13:42.720]  Well, gas prices are high because of the sanctions that Putin made us put on him.
[13:42.720 --> 13:43.720]  Oh, sanctions.
[13:43.720 --> 13:44.720]  So this is hurting Russia.
[13:44.720 --> 13:46.200]  They've never been better, actually.
[13:46.200 --> 13:47.200]  Okay.
[13:47.200 --> 13:48.200]  Well, what about our oil supply?
[13:48.200 --> 13:49.200]  No, it's awful.
[13:49.200 --> 13:51.440]  Actually, we're having to sell our strategic reserves.
[13:51.440 --> 13:52.440]  You mean use?
[13:52.440 --> 13:53.440]  No sell.
[13:53.440 --> 13:54.440]  Sell to who?
[13:54.440 --> 13:55.440]  China.
[13:55.440 --> 13:56.440]  You know, our enemy?
[13:56.440 --> 13:57.440]  Okay.
[13:57.440 --> 13:59.440]  So our reserves, like, why don't we just pump our own oil?
[13:59.440 --> 14:01.160]  Don't we have domestic production?
[14:01.160 --> 14:05.800]  Unfortunately, somebody already banned all of the pipelines and drilling permits, so
[14:05.800 --> 14:06.800]  can't use it.
[14:06.800 --> 14:07.800]  Yeah, that was you.
[14:07.800 --> 14:09.560]  We're going green.
[14:09.560 --> 14:11.560]  Gas prices have doubled.
[14:11.560 --> 14:12.680]  It's a transition.
[14:12.680 --> 14:14.280]  Transition into what?
[14:14.280 --> 14:15.280]  Transition for climate change.
[14:15.280 --> 14:17.000]  I thought we were talking about the war in Ukraine.
[14:17.000 --> 14:18.000]  Oh, right.
[14:18.000 --> 14:21.120]  Well, the weapons that we're giving Ukraine are extremely fuel efficient.
[14:21.120 --> 14:24.880]  We can kill thousands for the same amount of emissions as a small SUV.
[14:24.880 --> 14:26.560]  So, progress.
[14:26.560 --> 14:28.560]  And hey, here's some good news.
[14:28.560 --> 14:30.640]  Somebody just blew up Russia's underwater pipeline.
[14:30.640 --> 14:32.240]  Oh my God, who?
[14:32.240 --> 14:33.240]  I don't know.
[14:33.240 --> 14:35.080]  Who could it be?
[14:35.080 --> 14:36.280]  No one's going to believe that.
[14:36.280 --> 14:37.720]  They're going to think you did it.
[14:37.720 --> 14:38.720]  Me?
[14:38.720 --> 14:40.240]  The U.S. government?
[14:40.240 --> 14:42.000]  You know Russia has nukes, right?
[14:42.000 --> 14:49.160]  Like is this game of brinksmanship really worth it?
[14:49.160 --> 14:50.680]  I'm in my bunker now.
[14:50.680 --> 14:51.680]  It's pretty nice.
[14:51.680 --> 14:54.240]  What was that last question?
[14:54.240 --> 15:01.240]  I said, is it really worth this game of nuclear brinksmanship?
[15:24.240 --> 15:49.240]  So, will you please say hello to the folks that I know, tell them I won't be long.
[15:49.240 --> 16:04.800]  Like a rock thrown into a pond, your actions, you know they may seem little, have a massive
[16:04.800 --> 16:07.200]  ripple effect throughout time and space.
[16:07.200 --> 16:08.840]  We're actually winning the Info War.
[16:08.840 --> 16:13.760]  And when you realize that Band-Aut Video has hundreds and hundreds of censored directors
[16:13.760 --> 16:19.200]  and investigative journalists to talk to your host, whose information is beyond incredible.
[16:19.200 --> 16:24.840]  All of them, right now, telling the truth at Band-Aut Video.
[16:24.840 --> 16:27.240]  Millions of people today visiting Band-Aut Video.
[16:27.240 --> 16:31.840]  But you can take that information and cause a bigger ripple effect, an amplifying effect
[16:31.840 --> 16:36.840]  and make sure it gets out to your friends, your family, your neighbors and perfect strangers.
[16:36.840 --> 16:39.360]  You are the modern Paul Revere's.
[16:39.360 --> 16:42.520]  You are what takes our information and amplifies it.
[16:42.520 --> 16:47.320]  When you decide to take action, we as a species and as a race are invincible.
[16:47.320 --> 16:52.720]  So, I thank you all for your past action and I challenge you to redouble your efforts now
[16:52.720 --> 17:00.880]  because humanity and the children are counting on you.
[17:00.880 --> 17:06.680]  Why does the establishment spend so much time demonizing Info Wars, attacking myself and
[17:06.680 --> 17:08.720]  the crew and our other hosts?
[17:08.720 --> 17:10.560]  Because they know we're pro-human.
[17:10.560 --> 17:12.280]  They know we're telling the truth.
[17:12.280 --> 17:13.840]  They know we've got their number.
[17:13.840 --> 17:18.600]  They know everything we do is about empowering humanity.
[17:18.600 --> 17:23.200]  And God gave us, through Mother Nature, incredible compounds that will supercharge our body's
[17:23.200 --> 17:26.440]  stamina, libido, energy and immune systems.
[17:26.440 --> 17:32.480]  And we came out many years ago with Real Red Pill Plus that has all the documented compounds
[17:32.480 --> 17:41.160]  like preglonone and so much more to supercharge your body and to give your body the key elements
[17:41.160 --> 17:45.120]  and the key ingredients it needs to function at a proper level.
[17:45.120 --> 17:48.120]  This is the answer to the New World Order's tyranny.

[17:59.840 --> 18:02.640]  They want the planet for themselves, my friends.
[18:02.640 --> 18:11.120]  If we're so stupid, we let them kill us, we deserve it, except children don't deserve
[18:11.120 --> 18:12.120]  it, do they?
[18:12.120 --> 18:29.760]  And I looked and behold, a pale horse and he that sat on the horse was named Death.
[18:29.760 --> 18:40.480]  Now the translation is I looked and behold a pale horse and his name that sat on him
[18:40.480 --> 18:47.400]  was Death and Hell followed with him, a book of revelation.
[18:47.400 --> 18:50.880]  Very serious times to be alive folks, they're not just doing this as one off, this is the
[18:50.880 --> 18:54.920]  beginning of the rest of our lives, this is our fight and I'm proud of humanity.
[18:54.920 --> 18:58.760]  The globalists even admit it's leaked, they're very upset that they're losing and that this
[18:58.760 --> 19:00.720]  hasn't gone the way they thought it would.
[19:00.720 --> 19:07.160]  Climb to the top of the food chain with Alpha Power by Infowars Life for those who want
[19:07.160 --> 19:12.960]  to increase testosterone and energy levels, most men know that testosterone levels begin
[19:12.960 --> 19:18.720]  to decline starting around 30 at a rate of about 1-2% per year.
[19:18.720 --> 19:25.680]  This drop can show signs such as fatigue, low energy, low sex drive and muscle loss.

[20:02.000 --> 20:08.000]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[20:08.000 --> 20:26.720]  Well, she's got one of the best voting records in Congress and she was joined by Gozer and
[20:26.720 --> 20:33.280]  others that have similar awesome America first records in supporting McCarthy.
[20:33.280 --> 20:36.800]  She got a lot of criticism but Trump was supporting McCarthy as well.
[20:36.800 --> 20:39.840]  Here she is to tell us why she did it and what's on the agenda.
[20:39.840 --> 20:43.800]  I know what Roger Stone says, he says with that small majority that 20 members of so
[20:43.800 --> 20:48.280]  or patriots can now basically control the house and the entire agenda.
[20:48.280 --> 20:52.480]  But why would we then want McCarthy to be in that position?
[20:52.480 --> 20:57.600]  I guess we're going to ask MTG that but I love her, I think she's one of the best members
[20:57.600 --> 21:00.800]  of Congress and they're already getting a lot of great stuff passed and she's also
[21:00.800 --> 21:07.480]  announced that she's going to push for investigations into pharma, into the shots and into the origin
[21:07.480 --> 21:09.120]  of the virus and gain a function.
[21:09.120 --> 21:13.840]  So Congresswoman MTG Marjorie Taylor-Green is with us until 45 after.
[21:13.840 --> 21:16.320]  Congresswoman, thanks for making time.
[21:16.320 --> 21:17.840]  Thank you so much for having me, Alex.
[21:17.840 --> 21:19.920]  Well, I'm going to try to give you the floor.
[21:19.920 --> 21:24.400]  What do you want to tackle first, the agenda or what happened last week with McCarthy and
[21:24.400 --> 21:26.200]  the way forward here?
[21:26.200 --> 21:32.520]  Well, I can just make it real short and sweet and let everyone know that the person you
[21:32.520 --> 21:37.080]  see right now is no different than the person you've known over the past two years.
[21:37.080 --> 21:43.880]  And the reason why I didn't oppose Kevin McCarthy's speakership because I knew there was no plan
[21:43.880 --> 21:48.880]  against him because no one else was truly running for speaker.
[21:48.880 --> 21:54.440]  And I was also already on board with the agenda that he had set forth and that many of us
[21:54.440 --> 21:56.440]  had worked with him on.
[21:56.440 --> 22:00.920]  The great thing that people don't know about Kevin McCarthy is he has listened to us for
[22:00.920 --> 22:05.360]  the past two years and he's truly listening to the American people.
[22:05.360 --> 22:10.640]  He's working with President Trump all the time on the America First agenda.
[22:10.640 --> 22:18.200]  And so I'm already on board for that and I have truly hated Nancy Pelosi's speakership
[22:18.200 --> 22:21.680]  and watched her past Biden's agenda.
[22:21.680 --> 22:25.440]  And for me, I just could not wait to have a Republican speaker.
[22:25.440 --> 22:27.840]  I could not wait to have the gavel.
[22:27.840 --> 22:33.560]  And I was ready to go for investigations that need to be done and ready to go for real work
[22:33.560 --> 22:39.360]  to undo all the awful things that Joe Biden has been able to accomplish with Nancy Pelosi
[22:39.360 --> 22:43.880]  and Mitch McConnell helping her in the Senate.
[22:43.880 --> 22:48.680]  So I was ready and then I just want everybody to understand here's something very important
[22:48.680 --> 22:51.040]  and I've got both of them in my hand.
[22:51.040 --> 22:55.080]  This is the rules package right here.
[22:55.080 --> 23:00.400]  This is the rules package that we had on January 1st, the dates right here at the bottom.
[23:00.400 --> 23:05.640]  And this was before we ever took the first vote for speaker.
[23:05.640 --> 23:11.360]  And in this rules package, the only thing that got changed and here's the second rules
[23:11.360 --> 23:12.680]  package.
[23:12.680 --> 23:14.520]  This is on January 6th.
[23:14.520 --> 23:20.160]  This was the final day that we voted for speaker after 15 ballots.
[23:20.160 --> 23:26.360]  The only thing changed in the rules package was the motion to vacate went from one member
[23:26.360 --> 23:29.840]  of Congress, I mean, I'm sorry, five members of Congress.
[23:29.840 --> 23:35.800]  It was five members in the original package on January 1st and it went to one member on
[23:35.800 --> 23:38.880]  the motion to vacate on January 6th.
[23:38.880 --> 23:46.280]  So if anyone is confused and thinks that a lot changed after the big fighting they saw
[23:46.280 --> 23:54.200]  on television, after 15 ballots, 20 Republicans opposing Kevin McCarthy and a lot of negotiating,
[23:54.200 --> 24:00.520]  nothing changed in the rules, nothing changed in writing, but the motion to vacate from
[24:00.520 --> 24:02.000]  five members to one.
[24:02.000 --> 24:06.680]  Okay, so just to be clear, I like seeing 20 members flex their muscle.
[24:06.680 --> 24:10.280]  I liked that the demonstration of power, kind of like Senator Mnuchin has been able
[24:10.280 --> 24:11.840]  to do a lot of good things.
[24:11.840 --> 24:15.240]  He's certainly not perfect, but he's blocked a lot of really bad things because they have
[24:15.240 --> 24:18.400]  a very slim majority, the Democrats do in the Senate.
[24:18.400 --> 24:22.200]  You guys can now do something similarly with the 20 people you have.
[24:22.200 --> 24:25.000]  But what you're saying is McCarthy made a deal.
[24:25.000 --> 24:27.480]  He's been sticking by at the two years you've been with him.
[24:27.480 --> 24:28.800]  He made a new deal.
[24:28.800 --> 24:30.120]  And so you'd already agreed.
[24:30.120 --> 24:33.880]  And so you're saying basically it was smoking mirrors to act like there was a bunch of bad
[24:33.880 --> 24:35.520]  stuff that hadn't been done.
[24:35.520 --> 24:40.840]  What the truth is, you basically got the very same package that was already agreed to.
[24:40.840 --> 24:41.840]  That's right.
[24:41.840 --> 24:46.880]  It was the same package except the one piece, the motion to vacate went from five members
[24:46.880 --> 24:47.880]  to one.
[24:47.880 --> 24:53.880]  And I'll tell you the 20 opposing McCarthy proved that five members to vacate is plenty
[24:53.880 --> 24:58.920]  because 20 was stopping his ability to be speaker after 15 ballots.
[24:58.920 --> 25:03.600]  Now here is the good news, and this is where I do appreciate my colleagues and friends
[25:03.600 --> 25:06.960]  in the 20, but it was all of us.
[25:06.960 --> 25:08.920]  It was our entire conference.
[25:08.920 --> 25:14.400]  We're working together and hammering out the details in our conference meetings on what
[25:14.400 --> 25:20.480]  our agenda would be for this conference, this Congress, and the bills we wanted to pass.
[25:20.480 --> 25:25.800]  All of that was done and agreed on before January 1st.
[25:25.800 --> 25:31.640]  But here's what I do think is important because I've been one of the leaders, Alex, fighting
[25:31.640 --> 25:34.280]  on the House floor for the past two years.
[25:34.280 --> 25:35.280]  Everyone knows this.
[25:35.280 --> 25:36.280]  They have watched me do it.
[25:36.280 --> 25:41.840]  I've called for roll call votes over and over again so that Congress would be on record.
[25:41.840 --> 25:44.800]  I've opposed the Democrat's agenda.
[25:44.800 --> 25:52.520]  I've introduced multiple articles of impeachment on Joe Biden and Merrick Garland, cosponsored
[25:52.520 --> 25:55.000]  impeachment articles for Mayorkas.
[25:55.000 --> 25:58.520]  I really do believe in fighting to make sure that we do the right thing.
[25:58.520 --> 25:59.520]  Absolutely.
[25:59.520 --> 26:01.160]  That's why you were the number one enemy in the Congress of the media.
[26:01.160 --> 26:02.160]  We love you.
[26:02.160 --> 26:03.160]  We know that.
[26:03.160 --> 26:07.560]  The media has tried to manipulate some of the right wing to create an internal Republican
[26:07.560 --> 26:09.520]  fight as a distraction.
[26:09.520 --> 26:13.360]  People scored a lot of points doing that, but it really didn't do anything.
[26:13.360 --> 26:14.360]  So now I want to move on.
[26:14.360 --> 26:15.880]  I just wanted to get it on record.
[26:15.880 --> 26:18.960]  Most of the audience understands that, but for some that didn't or thought, well, why
[26:18.960 --> 26:21.480]  is Jones not mad about this?
[26:21.480 --> 26:24.080]  It's because we're going to wait and see what happens now.
[26:24.080 --> 26:28.160]  And I trust you and I trust Trump on almost every issue other than the shots.
[26:28.160 --> 26:31.440]  And so we're already seeing some really good bills getting voted on.
[26:31.440 --> 26:35.600]  Tell us now what's on the agenda in the new Congress and how the public can support you
[26:35.600 --> 26:40.400]  and other good members to get this through and then block Joe Biden's great reset.
[26:40.400 --> 26:41.400]  Okay.
[26:41.400 --> 26:42.400]  Absolutely.
[26:42.400 --> 26:43.400]  Yeah.
[26:43.400 --> 26:44.920]  We have to block the great reset.
[26:44.920 --> 26:46.600]  We have to stop the globalization.
[26:46.600 --> 26:48.560]  We have to stop all of those things.
[26:48.560 --> 26:52.760]  So now just to let everyone know so they can have confidence going forward, I want to remind
[26:52.760 --> 26:55.320]  everybody of one important thing.
[26:55.320 --> 26:58.080]  There's 222 members of Congress.
[26:58.080 --> 27:04.480]  It takes 218 Republicans to pass any bill on the House floor.
[27:04.480 --> 27:10.560]  So that means that if we want to work really hard to stop something or change something,
[27:10.560 --> 27:14.240]  conservatives can do that in Congress and I'm a conservative and we will be working
[27:14.240 --> 27:19.280]  hard to make sure that our Republican conference is successful and is serving the American
[27:19.280 --> 27:21.040]  people in the America first agenda.
[27:21.040 --> 27:22.800]  So I want to make that very clear.
[27:22.800 --> 27:25.640]  Here's some great things that we've already gotten done this week.
[27:25.640 --> 27:31.520]  First thing we did was we defunded Joe Biden's 87,000 IRS Army.
[27:31.520 --> 27:33.440]  That was the first thing we did.
[27:33.440 --> 27:39.480]  We've already established a select committee on strategic competition between the United
[27:39.480 --> 27:41.040]  States and China.
[27:41.040 --> 27:43.800]  So we're going to be holding China accountable.
[27:43.800 --> 27:50.000]  We've also established a select subcommittee on the weaponization of the federal government
[27:50.000 --> 27:54.920]  as a select investigative committee of the Committee on Judiciary.
[27:54.920 --> 28:00.040]  This will hold FBI DOJ accountable for how they've censored Americans, how they've gone
[28:00.040 --> 28:06.960]  after parents on school boards and how they basically ignored the attacks on Justice Kavanaugh
[28:06.960 --> 28:13.800]  and other Supreme Court justices after the Dobs decision, but yet did nothing about these
[28:13.800 --> 28:21.400]  Antifa activists and basically terrorist firebombing and going after pregnancy resource centers.
[28:21.400 --> 28:25.080]  So we're going to be holding them accountable and these committees have been established,
[28:25.080 --> 28:30.560]  the one on China and the one on the weaponization of the government.
[28:30.560 --> 28:34.920]  So we've also done some other things and remember, we've only been here a week.
[28:34.920 --> 28:40.120]  We don't even have our committee set up because that got delayed from the infighting last
[28:40.120 --> 28:41.120]  week.
[28:41.120 --> 28:42.120]  All right.
[28:42.120 --> 28:43.120]  Stay right there, MGG.
[28:43.120 --> 28:44.120]  We got to go to break.
[28:44.120 --> 28:46.120]  We want to come back and talk more about the agenda and more about your call for congressional
[28:46.120 --> 28:47.880]  hearings on what happened with the shots.
[28:47.880 --> 28:50.880]  There's a criminal investigation now going in Florida by the state.
[28:50.880 --> 28:54.840]  The German government, the Japanese government, it's happening everywhere and you're the tip
[28:54.840 --> 28:56.320]  of the spear there in Congress.
[28:56.320 --> 28:57.320]  They're in the House.
[28:57.320 --> 28:58.320]  We're in the Senate.
[28:58.320 --> 29:00.760]  It's calling for one as well.
[29:00.760 --> 29:02.440]  Info Wars is winning.
[29:02.440 --> 29:04.480]  Info Wars is reaching more people than ever.
[29:04.480 --> 29:07.240]  We were supposed to be off the air months and months and months ago.
[29:07.240 --> 29:10.000]  Main Street media told you, but it's not true.
[29:10.000 --> 29:12.080]  They told you we were going to be shut down.
[29:12.080 --> 29:14.160]  They told you we owed a billion and a half dollars.
[29:14.160 --> 29:15.160]  None of that's true.
[29:15.160 --> 29:16.480]  It's all being appealed.
[29:16.480 --> 29:20.760]  They want you to think Info Wars is dead, but if you simply stand up and support Info
[29:20.760 --> 29:25.520]  Wars, we've got years and years of appeals and we will not be taken off the air.
[29:25.520 --> 29:29.160]  But if they can convince you that we've been shut down, they're going to win.
[29:29.160 --> 29:31.640]  Don't let the globalists sigh up you and your family.

[29:40.840 --> 29:41.840]  has not worked.

[30:09.440 --> 30:11.760]  got their number and I know how to bring them down.
[30:11.760 --> 30:16.240]  But, ladies and gentlemen, I can't do it without your support.
[30:16.240 --> 30:20.680]  The good news is we're only under about $200,000 a month.
[30:20.680 --> 30:24.520]  The bad news is the enemy is intensifying their attacks on every front, but I'm not going
[30:24.520 --> 30:27.360]  to back down and I'll never give up, but I could give out.
[30:27.360 --> 30:29.280]  So please keep me on the field.

[30:53.920 --> 31:00.280]  The globalists are counting on you, not taking action.
[31:00.280 --> 31:02.480]  There is a war on for your mind.
[31:02.480 --> 31:04.240]  Your mind is a battlefield.
[31:04.240 --> 31:06.520]  This is an information war.
[31:06.520 --> 31:12.240]  Info wars popularized those terms more than two decades ago and today, whether it's Donald
[31:12.240 --> 31:18.960]  Trump or Governor DeSantis or Dr. Robert Malone, they're all using the terms that Info Wars
[31:18.960 --> 31:23.200]  has popularized because we understand the enemy's operations and we know how to beat
[31:23.200 --> 31:24.200]  them.
[31:24.200 --> 31:27.920]  But we can't do it without funding and we make it easy to fund with great products and

[31:45.560 --> 31:49.720]  world order in the nose, punching their lies in the nose.
[31:49.720 --> 31:51.600]  We are going to defeat the new world order.
[31:51.600 --> 31:54.240]  We're going over the top, but right now is the critical juncture.

[32:18.360 --> 32:21.280]  products or the exact same products in stores around the country.
[32:21.280 --> 32:25.240]  That's because we go right to the highest quality manufacturer in the nation that supplies
[32:25.240 --> 32:26.760]  some of the top names.
[32:26.760 --> 32:29.800]  They then give us the best deal out there because the owner is a listener and we're
[32:29.800 --> 32:32.200]  able to bring it to you with massive discounts.
[32:32.200 --> 32:36.680]  You're not going to find 1,000 milligram high quality CBD for anywhere near the price we
[32:36.680 --> 32:37.680]  sell it.
[32:37.680 --> 32:40.520]  You're not going to find at the 10 milligram or the 20 milligram, you're not going to find
[32:40.520 --> 32:43.520]  tumor at 95% or humanoid at the price we're selling it.
[32:43.520 --> 32:46.200]  You're not going to find any of this anywhere near that.
[32:46.200 --> 32:51.480]  These similar formulas or the same formulas sell for up to 200% more than we're selling
[32:51.480 --> 32:52.480]  these.
[32:52.480 --> 33:02.040]  Info wars MD, now available exclusively at infowarstore.com, a true 360 win.
[33:02.040 --> 33:13.200]  Reading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[33:13.200 --> 33:19.920]  Waging war on corruption, it's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of
[33:19.920 --> 33:22.040]  the info war.
[33:22.040 --> 33:36.880]  A lot of big things are about to happen, she can't tell you about yet, she was telling
[33:36.880 --> 33:40.680]  me during the break there's going to be a major move in the house and the senate exposing
[33:40.680 --> 33:44.880]  these poison shots and the people dying suddenly in the collapses.
[33:44.880 --> 33:50.640]  Can you tell us as much as you can right now about what you can get to about plans to really
[33:50.640 --> 33:55.400]  go after the deep state, not just there, but also the censorship of the big intelligence
[33:55.400 --> 34:01.080]  agencies working with big tech, we now know to surveil people, not just censor them, and
[34:01.080 --> 34:03.280]  big pharma involved with that as well.
[34:03.280 --> 34:07.880]  Yes, so on the oversight committee we're going to be investigating everything people have
[34:07.880 --> 34:10.800]  seen come out of the Twitter files.
[34:10.800 --> 34:19.160]  This is the collaboration between the DCCC, between outside organizations with homeland
[34:19.160 --> 34:25.000]  combined with the Biden administration, big tech, Twitter this extends to Facebook, Google,
[34:25.000 --> 34:30.160]  YouTube, you know this of all people, Alex, the government has truly collaborated with
[34:30.160 --> 34:36.880]  big tech to censor and silence taking away the first amendment rights of Americans, that
[34:36.880 --> 34:40.840]  is going to be a huge investigation that will be happening through the oversight committee
[34:40.840 --> 34:44.560]  and we cannot wait to get it ready to go.
[34:44.560 --> 34:49.760]  Other things you're going to see, there is going to be a special committee dedicated
[34:49.760 --> 34:55.440]  to COVID and this will deal with everything from the origins of COVID, investigating the
[34:55.440 --> 35:00.680]  gain of function research and of how much tax dollars went towards that, it will investigate
[35:00.680 --> 35:06.040]  the National Institute of Health, Dr. Fauci and any other employees there in the federal
[35:06.040 --> 35:14.920]  government that were involved with the Wuhan lab, China, it will investigate where people's
[35:14.920 --> 35:21.520]  taxpayer funds went in relation to COVID-19 and then don't forget about how many small
[35:21.520 --> 35:28.280]  businesses were forced to close, you know, children who committed suicide, adults who
[35:28.280 --> 35:35.960]  committed suicide, school closures, just unreal devastation to the American people as well
[35:35.960 --> 35:41.280]  as COVID deaths all over the world, think about how many senior citizens died in their
[35:41.280 --> 35:45.320]  nursing homes because COVID patients were put in there.
[35:45.320 --> 35:51.480]  I'm also very interested in investigating what is happening with people having suddenly
[35:51.480 --> 36:01.040]  this high amount of strokes, blood clots, cardiac arrest, adult sudden death syndrome,
[36:01.040 --> 36:05.200]  people dying suddenly, this is all caught on camera, you were showing it during your
[36:05.200 --> 36:11.400]  break and these videos are shocking, anyone that has been around on planet earth for longer
[36:11.400 --> 36:17.360]  than two years knows for a fact, none of these things are normal and it needs to be investigated
[36:17.360 --> 36:19.520]  and people need to be held accountable.
[36:19.520 --> 36:27.080]  I'm very interested in the VAERS reports on the CDC, the amount of deaths and vaccine
[36:27.080 --> 36:34.200]  injuries reported in relation to the COVID-19 vaccine is staggering and it isn't made up,
[36:34.200 --> 36:41.480]  it isn't false information, it isn't misinformation, it's very real and I believe all of those
[36:41.480 --> 36:44.360]  reports need to be investigated.
[36:44.360 --> 36:48.920]  So there's a lot that needs to be done, as a matter of fact so much that needs to be
[36:48.920 --> 36:52.640]  done, I just don't even know if we're going to have the time to do it but we're going
[36:52.640 --> 36:59.040]  to put every ounce of energy and time we can into this investigation so people will be
[36:59.040 --> 37:04.400]  seeing this up and coming, that committee has not been set up and assigned yet but it will
[37:04.400 --> 37:08.200]  be set up and assigned I believe next week.
[37:08.200 --> 37:13.160]  Here's something exciting that people in the pro-life community can celebrate today,
[37:13.160 --> 37:19.960]  we passed this this week that would require healthcare workers to provide the same level
[37:19.960 --> 37:28.240]  of care to babies who survive an abortion as they would to a baby that say was born
[37:28.240 --> 37:36.600]  prematurely or you know in an emergency situation, it's shocking to me Alex that every single
[37:36.600 --> 37:41.240]  Democrat voted against this except one voted present.
[37:41.240 --> 37:45.480]  Well that was my next point, I had the Fox News article 210 Democrats voted against Bill
[37:45.480 --> 37:52.160]  requiring medical care for babies born alive after abortion attempt, that is just unbelievable.
[37:52.160 --> 37:59.280]  Yeah this just shows you how cold heartless and evil Democrats are that they would literally
[37:59.280 --> 38:06.800]  vote against medical care for a baby that survived an abortion, a horrific attempted
[38:06.800 --> 38:12.880]  murder on this on this life and the baby is still born alive, Democrats are voting to
[38:12.880 --> 38:19.680]  murder it to make sure that it dies, to make sure that this this little boy or little girl
[38:19.680 --> 38:24.400]  is just fighting for their life after they're born, Democrats want them dead, every single
[38:24.400 --> 38:26.760]  Republican voted to save their life.
[38:26.760 --> 38:29.920]  Beyond evil, we've only got about four minutes left, you've been very gracious, I want to
[38:29.920 --> 38:34.960]  run through a bunch of topics with you now, what do you make of Biden saying he knew nothing
[38:34.960 --> 38:40.040]  about the documents at his foundation at Penn State, now more documents pertaining to China
[38:40.040 --> 38:44.600]  just like at Penn State, we know he and his son have been on the Chinese payroll that
[38:44.600 --> 38:49.080]  came on the laptop and more, how smoking gun is this because as you know a vice president
[38:49.080 --> 38:53.080]  cannot declassify documents only a president can do it, so what Trump did was totally legal
[38:53.080 --> 38:59.400]  and totally normal and now we know Biden has them at his house, this is insane.
[38:59.400 --> 39:02.960]  This is a very serious issue and we're already having a lot of meetings on this and I've
[39:02.960 --> 39:07.200]  been involved and I've spoken with President Trump multiple times about it, the president
[39:07.200 --> 39:12.520]  of the United States is the only one that can declassify documents, the vice president
[39:12.520 --> 39:17.560]  cannot declassify documents and for Joe Biden to be in possession of classified documents
[39:17.560 --> 39:22.400]  that means that he stole them, that he's not supposed to be in possession of those but
[39:22.400 --> 39:28.600]  what we're seeing and the fact that his own staff, his own attorneys is revealing that
[39:28.600 --> 39:33.920]  Joe Biden three times now, three times they're revealing that he is in possession of classified
[39:33.920 --> 39:39.600]  documents, I think there's a lot to be said there, I think one question is number one,
[39:39.600 --> 39:43.520]  what are these documents and why is he in possession of them, well clearly I believe
[39:43.520 --> 39:49.000]  he stole them, number two, why is his own staff and his own attorneys being the one
[39:49.000 --> 39:54.120]  to reveal this information, I think there's a lot there too, are they preemptively trying
[39:54.120 --> 39:58.720]  to stop more information from coming out or are we actually seeing the Democrat party
[39:58.720 --> 40:05.600]  starting to turn on Joe Biden, that's what I think it is, yes we already know that Hunter
[40:05.600 --> 40:10.400]  Biden is in a lot of trouble with his laptop and that's another thing that we'll be doing
[40:10.400 --> 40:15.920]  on the ever site committee is heavily investigating into Hunter Biden's laptop into their bank
[40:15.920 --> 40:20.560]  accounts, I don't care about his drug use, I think it's disgusting and it's very sad
[40:20.560 --> 40:25.560]  but being a communist Chinese as his audio recordings are, I work for the Chinese intelligence
[40:25.560 --> 40:30.120]  chief, he's been arrested, what do I do daddy, another big subject, Biden's attacking our
[40:30.120 --> 40:34.960]  energy infrastructure not just our pipelines and taking our strategic oil reserve and selling
[40:34.960 --> 40:41.040]  it to China, now they're set, Fox News is reporting, to try to ban all gas heaters and
[40:41.040 --> 40:46.040]  stoves, those are incredibly clean sources of heat and energy including our food, what
[40:46.040 --> 40:48.000]  are you going to do about that?
[40:48.000 --> 40:52.080]  I think it's appalling and we have to stop it and I want you to know the vote that I
[40:52.080 --> 40:58.720]  just had an hour ago, Republicans voted to stop any of our oil and our strategic petroleum
[40:58.720 --> 41:04.280]  reserves to be sold to China, that was something that we just got done today but this attack
[41:04.280 --> 41:10.080]  on the gas industry is appalling and it's America last, the government has no right
[41:10.080 --> 41:17.520]  to control the demand in our economy and the American people, everyone demands natural
[41:17.520 --> 41:22.400]  gas, it's an easy choice between an electric stove and a gas stove, everyone wants a gas
[41:22.400 --> 41:26.000]  stove and it's not about the climate, they're lying about that.
[41:26.000 --> 41:28.880]  Well that's right, at first they said they were going to do it but there was a backlash,
[41:28.880 --> 41:33.440]  now they've backed off but you know what they do, now they'll bring it back again.
[41:33.440 --> 41:38.120]  That's right, well what it is is the globalist agenda for the Green New Deal and it has to
[41:38.120 --> 41:43.640]  be stopped Alex, it's the most dangerous thing for our entire planet and all of humanity
[41:43.640 --> 41:50.280]  because the Green New Deal will cause more humans to die than any type of fossil fuel
[41:50.280 --> 41:51.280]  usage.
[41:51.280 --> 41:52.280]  Absolutely.
[41:52.280 --> 41:59.640]  In any type of climate lie, more people are alive today because of fossil fuels, we have
[41:59.640 --> 42:03.560]  more food available to humans in any kind of industry.
[42:03.560 --> 42:05.280]  We're out of time, we've only got 45 seconds.
[42:05.280 --> 42:10.040]  Will you also push for investigations of the DeBose Group that brags that it's been grooming
[42:10.040 --> 42:14.360]  and paying off and controlling US politicians and others?
[42:14.360 --> 42:18.200]  I see that as just a big of threat as common as China, what's your view in 30 seconds on
[42:18.200 --> 42:19.200]  that?
[42:19.200 --> 42:26.160]  Alex, I'm dedicated to the oversight and investigation and to any abuse of our government
[42:26.160 --> 42:32.120]  and the taxpayer's funds, I'm dedicated to that, but here's another great news, we're
[42:32.120 --> 42:37.480]  kicking Eric Swalwell, Ilhan Omar and Adam Schiff off of their committees.
[42:37.480 --> 42:40.640]  That was Kevin McCarthy's promise and he's making sure that gets done.
[42:40.640 --> 42:44.680]  I forgot that was one of the other incredible things you did, two segments is not enough,
[42:44.680 --> 42:48.480]  Marjorie Taylor Green, we love you, we salute you, great job, you're such a leader, you're
[42:48.480 --> 42:51.440]  such a God send, thank you so much.
[42:51.440 --> 42:52.440]  Thank you Alex.
[42:52.440 --> 43:00.000]  Got big news coming up on the other side talking about DeBose, stay with us, wait to hear this.
[43:00.000 --> 43:06.600]  Mark Twain, one of America's greatest writers and satirist in, Mize, famously said more
[43:06.600 --> 43:13.160]  than 150 years ago, rumors of his demise had been greatly exaggerated because the newspapers
[43:13.160 --> 43:19.040]  kept saying he died decades before he did die and it's the same PSYOP today.
[43:19.040 --> 43:23.320]  Info Wars is more influential and more powerful than ever because of your support and because
[43:23.320 --> 43:26.440]  of the facts of what we've covered is coming true.
[43:26.440 --> 43:30.120]  But if they can convince you we've been shut down, if they can convince you that we're
[43:30.120 --> 43:35.160]  going away and you stop supporting, you stop spreading the word, then they do win.
[43:35.160 --> 43:39.560]  Ladies and gentlemen, there's only one group of people that can shut down Info Wars and
[43:39.560 --> 43:41.360]  that's you, the viewers and listeners.
[43:41.360 --> 43:43.320]  If you decide we're done, we're done.
[43:43.320 --> 43:47.480]  If you decide to go to infowarshore.com and get supplements and books and films and t-shirts
[43:47.480 --> 43:50.600]  and so much more, we will stay on the air indefinitely.
[43:50.600 --> 43:52.000]  It is all in your hands.
[43:52.000 --> 43:56.240]  So thanks for your support, stand up against the globalists, go to infowarshore.com right
[43:56.240 --> 43:57.840]  now and keep us on air.
[43:57.840 --> 43:59.640]  It's up to you.
[43:59.640 --> 44:05.080]  I'm Dr. Peter McCullough and it's an absolute pleasure to introduce to you the Wellness
[44:05.080 --> 44:11.960]  Company, an alternative healthcare system for this COVID and post-COVID world where
[44:11.960 --> 44:17.440]  trust has been lost in doctors and healthcare systems.
[44:17.440 --> 44:26.600]  This new online virtual platform is nationwide providing uncensored content, virtual appointments,
[44:26.600 --> 44:35.000]  laboratory testing, diagnostics, prescriptions, treatment packages specifically for COVID,
[44:35.000 --> 44:40.600]  post-COVID, vaccine injury syndromes and all the usual things that are seen in primary
[44:40.600 --> 44:42.400]  care.
[44:42.400 --> 44:49.360]  And then we have an entire array of holistic products, an online store, media and health
[44:49.360 --> 44:50.600]  advice.
[44:50.600 --> 44:59.880]  Come see the Wellness Company and go to onlinehealthnow.com as a conduit to the Wellness Company.
[44:59.880 --> 45:05.760]  Once a tragedy reaches a level of national significance, American citizens should be
[45:05.760 --> 45:11.120]  allowed to basically question that event in any way that they deem fit.
[45:11.120 --> 45:13.240]  The first amendment is unique in the world.
[45:13.240 --> 45:16.000]  That's what they want to take away, your ability to speak freely.
[45:16.000 --> 45:19.200]  So they're going to go for Mike Lindell next, or are they going to go for Steve Bannon,
[45:19.200 --> 45:20.640]  or are they going to go for Tucker Carlson?
[45:20.640 --> 45:24.800]  I studied the globalist 30 years ago, but on air 28 years, and I knew they were planning
[45:24.800 --> 45:28.760]  all of this, and I warned the public as a modern Paul Revere, but I couldn't have done
[45:28.760 --> 45:29.760]  it without your support.
[45:29.760 --> 45:33.240]  And now, because we've been so successful warning the population of the planet, not
[45:33.240 --> 45:37.200]  just America, we're public enemy number one when it comes to the globalist agenda.
[45:37.200 --> 45:41.400]  That's why it's more important than ever to realize how successful Info Wars has been
[45:41.400 --> 45:43.080]  because of your past support.
[45:43.080 --> 45:46.920]  So I salute you, and I thank you, and I ask you now, the critical juncture of the battle,
[45:46.920 --> 45:51.320]  free double your efforts of visiting infowarstore.com and getting amazing products that keep us
[45:51.320 --> 45:52.320]  on air.

[45:54.320 --> 45:59.120]  The destination is infowarstore.com, and I thank you all for your support.
[45:59.120 --> 46:04.520]  Look, it's not hype when you've delivered, and Info Wars has been the tip of spear against
[46:04.520 --> 46:05.520]  tyranny.
[46:05.520 --> 46:09.360]  But when it comes to the products we sell to funder operation, they're just like our
[46:09.360 --> 46:10.880]  news and information.
[46:10.880 --> 46:13.760]  They are powerful, and they change the world.
[46:13.760 --> 46:17.360]  The real Red Pill Plus is one of our top sellers, but for over two years, it's been
[46:17.360 --> 46:19.640]  sold out because of supply chain breakdowns.
[46:19.640 --> 46:23.960]  It's finally back at stock for 50% off at infowarstore.com.
[46:23.960 --> 46:27.960]  Now, in the limited time we have, I can't get into all the ingredients that are in it,
[46:27.960 --> 46:30.040]  but this sucker is amazing.
[46:30.040 --> 46:35.440]  Look for yourself at how loaded each bottle is, ladies and gentlemen.
[46:35.440 --> 46:39.760]  Every one of these will supercharge your day and everything you do.
[46:39.760 --> 46:43.160]  Just look into the preglonone that we've got that's in this product.

[46:55.960 --> 47:01.480]  Red Pill Plus, 50% off, infowarstore.com.
[47:01.480 --> 47:07.480]  Finding a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[47:31.480 --> 47:36.480]  We are back on Broadcasting Worldwide.
[47:36.480 --> 47:39.760]  I'm going to be here till 2 o'clock today and then several great guest toes fighting
[47:39.760 --> 47:40.760]  the New World Order.
[47:40.760 --> 47:46.200]  We'll be hosting the fourth hour from New Zealand, then at 3 o'clock central, the great
[47:46.200 --> 47:49.600]  Owen Stroyer takes over with the War Room.
[47:49.600 --> 47:53.560]  At 2 central, I'm going to be on Piers Morgan's show that's top show in the UK.
[47:53.560 --> 47:56.480]  It's also broadcast here in the U.S. and it's online.
[47:56.480 --> 47:59.880]  When he does big interviews, they get about 10 million views on YouTube.
[47:59.880 --> 48:01.480]  I really look forward to that.
[48:01.480 --> 48:10.040]  I haven't debated Piers Morgan since 2013, almost 10 years ago, and that was the biggest
[48:10.040 --> 48:13.480]  event that year in ratings-wise on CNN.
[48:13.480 --> 48:15.400]  This will be an hour-long debate.
[48:15.400 --> 48:21.040]  I'm going to be friendly and nice if he lets me talk, but if he tries to run over me, well,
[48:21.040 --> 48:22.040]  you know what happens.
[48:22.040 --> 48:25.040]  If you think you're getting our guns, 1776.
[48:25.040 --> 48:32.640]  If you think you're getting our free speech, 1776, but I really want to try to have an
[48:32.640 --> 48:36.640]  in-depth discussion with him on a host of topics because he has a large audience.
[48:36.640 --> 48:40.960]  I'd like to warn people about the New World Order.
[48:40.960 --> 48:49.000]  So we'll put a link up today on infowars.com at 2 p.m.
[48:49.000 --> 48:53.000]  He wanted me on tape before and then he wanted me on live and I said, listen, I'll only do
[48:53.000 --> 48:54.000]  it live.
[48:54.000 --> 48:58.600]  So he says it'll be live, his show starts at 2 p.m. central, so we'll have that up on
[48:58.600 --> 49:07.560]  the front page streaming on infowars.com while the other co-host and host are doing a great
[49:07.560 --> 49:10.720]  job in the fourth hour today.
[49:10.720 --> 49:13.480]  And there's a bunch of other big podcasts I'm going to be on the next week.
[49:13.480 --> 49:14.480]  I'll leave it at that.
[49:14.480 --> 49:17.720]  There's going to be some other really big podcasters the next week or two that are going
[49:17.720 --> 49:18.720]  to be in studio with us.
[49:18.720 --> 49:25.600]  I'll just leave it at that, but look for a lot of next level surprises here at the InfoWar.
[49:25.600 --> 49:32.600]  Okay, I've got just some totally insane articles here in front of me that when you read them,
[49:32.600 --> 49:38.040]  you think these people are crazy, but they're not crazy in the way you think of a schizophrenic
[49:38.040 --> 49:48.560]  that thinks there's aliens in the attic or that there's a man living under their bed.
[49:48.560 --> 49:50.600]  They're crazy that they love to be evil.
[49:50.600 --> 49:52.760]  They're crazy that they think they can get away with evil.
[49:52.760 --> 49:58.480]  They're crazy that they reject God, but they're trying to make us crazy and trying to make
[49:58.480 --> 50:02.400]  us submit to any form of brainwashing and control they want.
[50:02.400 --> 50:07.360]  So I'm going to hit two big examples of that here in just a moment.
[50:07.360 --> 50:11.840]  Then I'm going to cover news and open the phones up in the second hour, and then we have a
[50:11.840 --> 50:17.840]  very well-known pastor and international television radio host who also has a large church who's
[50:17.840 --> 50:22.600]  been living down on the Texas border the last few months in a tent with his wife.
[50:22.600 --> 50:27.840]  He's gotten some amazing footage, and he'll be joining us in the third hour to lay that
[50:27.840 --> 50:28.840]  out.
[50:28.840 --> 50:30.880]  But we'll be taking your calls some in the next hour.
[50:30.880 --> 50:33.800]  I'll give that number out here at the end of the segment, and we'll start lining you
[50:33.800 --> 50:39.000]  guys up to get you on air in our number two.
[50:39.000 --> 50:46.040]  But the gaslighting that I want to hit is extremely important, and it's bigger than
[50:46.040 --> 50:47.680]  just these two stories.
[50:47.680 --> 50:53.760]  It's an example of the mindset of the globalist who are trying to train us to accept absurdity
[50:53.760 --> 50:59.400]  because you'd have to be brain dead or just totally out of your mind to want to live in
[50:59.400 --> 51:02.760]  the world they're trying to build, the world they're trying to destroy.
[51:02.760 --> 51:07.160]  But before I do that, I want to thank the viewers for their incredible support, your
[51:07.160 --> 51:11.400]  prayer, your word of mouth, as well as the listeners and everybody else.
[51:11.400 --> 51:17.120]  And I want to encourage you to realize that we're sponsored by you, and we have been in
[51:17.120 --> 51:22.080]  the red for the last six months off and on, and I really had put the plea out for you
[51:22.080 --> 51:26.720]  to get great products that you already really need that really will enrich and empower your
[51:26.720 --> 51:29.920]  life in amazing ways, and it could save your life.
[51:29.920 --> 51:33.000]  You need all the vitamins, all the minerals, all the trace elements, and the products we've
[51:33.000 --> 51:34.000]  got.
[51:34.000 --> 51:36.520]  If you don't get them from us, get them somewhere else, but these are the very best, and they
[51:36.520 --> 51:37.760]  keep us on air.
[51:37.760 --> 51:40.680]  So I think we should be the place you spend your money, your hard earned money, and I'm
[51:40.680 --> 51:43.720]  very respectful of that and very thankful.
[51:43.720 --> 51:48.800]  But I really came to you in the last week and told you we need help, and folks have
[51:48.800 --> 51:51.200]  come through.
[51:51.200 --> 51:56.040]  If people continue to buy products at Info or Store at the level you've been buying
[51:56.040 --> 52:04.280]  them in the last week, we will be out of the hole we've been in about a month.
[52:04.280 --> 52:10.320]  It'll take a month of increased sales to dig us out of the million plus dollar six month
[52:10.320 --> 52:12.200]  hole we're in.
[52:12.200 --> 52:16.760]  And then if those sales continue, we will then be able to successfully move forward,
[52:16.760 --> 52:20.440]  and we've got some great sponsors that are about to come on board in about a month that
[52:20.440 --> 52:26.440]  will take care of the underage, and then it won't be such a desperate situation.
[52:26.440 --> 52:28.880]  But we have the products in stock that we have in stock.
[52:28.880 --> 52:31.520]  Any order you order will be shipped to you within a day.
[52:31.520 --> 52:32.760]  These are amazing products.
[52:32.760 --> 52:33.760]  X2, X3 sold out.
[52:33.760 --> 52:36.800]  A lot of our best selling products are sold out, and a lot of our other great products
[52:36.800 --> 52:41.560]  have come back in like Real Red Pill Plus, like Down and Out Sleep Aid, and like the
[52:41.560 --> 52:47.760]  new Pain MD from Info Wars Platinum that is just incredibly powerful compounds that are
[52:47.760 --> 52:52.360]  healthy ways to really mitigate and deal with pain.
[52:52.360 --> 52:54.240]  People take this, they love it.
[52:54.240 --> 53:00.400]  This is a clone or a private label by us of the number one best selling natural pain
[53:00.400 --> 53:02.520]  reliever on the market.
[53:02.520 --> 53:10.000]  It's very strong, painmdinfowarsstore.com.
[53:10.000 --> 53:17.480]  Also testosterone 1776 boost is the name I gave it, 1776 testosterone boost.
[53:17.480 --> 53:25.280]  It is just a private label of the number one natural testosterone booster out there from
[53:25.280 --> 53:28.920]  the top pharmaceutical company that puts it out but sells it over the counter at stores
[53:28.920 --> 53:31.480]  for $100 a bottle.
[53:31.480 --> 53:36.120]  You can get it for $54 at infowarsstore.com.
[53:36.120 --> 53:41.320]  I can sell cheap testosterone boasters that don't cost very much money.
[53:41.320 --> 53:45.800]  This costs a lot because it's got really, really good ingredients for us to get, and
[53:45.800 --> 53:49.120]  then we cut it way back from the markup you'd see in stores.
[53:49.120 --> 53:57.880]  So get 1776 testosterone boost today at infowarsstore.com, or triple eight, two five, three, three
[53:57.880 --> 53:59.240]  one, three nine.
[53:59.240 --> 54:01.200]  Down and Out Sleep Aid is our strongest sleep aid.
[54:01.200 --> 54:02.200]  We've got three of them.
[54:02.200 --> 54:03.200]  They're all excellent.
[54:03.200 --> 54:04.200]  This one's really strong.
[54:04.200 --> 54:05.200]  Be careful with it.
[54:05.200 --> 54:11.640]  Big doses of the valerian root and melatonin and five other ingredients.

[54:37.800 --> 54:41.360]  Despite that, we need the funds in now, so it's 50% off, but it's going to sell out.
[54:41.360 --> 54:44.040]  Real Red Pill Plus, infowarsstore.com.
[54:44.040 --> 54:47.040]  Okay.
[54:47.040 --> 54:50.040]  Let me start getting to this, then I'm going to hit it more next hour and then go to your
[54:50.040 --> 54:51.040]  calls.
[54:51.040 --> 54:56.280]  This is such a big deal because this is happening all over the western globalist controlled
[54:56.280 --> 55:01.560]  world, similar things to this, and they do this on purpose, so it's totally absurd so
[55:01.560 --> 55:03.920]  that when you accept it, you're now in a cult.
[55:03.920 --> 55:08.400]  No, it's not saying two men can have a baby or that women in the prison are having babies
[55:08.400 --> 55:10.360]  when it's men they're putting in prisons.
[55:10.360 --> 55:14.240]  That's all meant to be absurd as well, or that carbon dioxide is poisonous when it's what
[55:14.240 --> 55:16.120]  plants breathe and put off oxygen.
[55:16.120 --> 55:17.600]  They've already done all that.
[55:17.600 --> 55:22.920]  And other universities have banned the word Lynch, Lynch Hall, it's an Irish last name.
[55:22.920 --> 55:27.040]  The Irish got a pace for Lynch Hall, they banned the name Lynch Hall 100 years later
[55:27.040 --> 55:29.960]  because Lynch might make somebody think they're going to get lynched.
[55:29.960 --> 55:36.120]  Now the University of Southern California removes the word field for being racist.
[55:36.120 --> 55:42.080]  You may not use it in the textbooks, in the articles, if you say it, you'll be censored.
[55:42.080 --> 55:50.520]  First it's the N word, now it's the word field, meaning energy field, grass field, the football
[55:50.520 --> 55:54.800]  field and people will now submit, it's another word they won't say.
[55:54.800 --> 56:01.960]  Now like the fist bump emoji is being banned all over because the ADL says it is a white
[56:01.960 --> 56:02.960]  power symbol.
[56:02.960 --> 56:06.760]  They also say that the OK symbol is bad.
[56:06.760 --> 56:11.200]  Again, it's about these groups controlling language, controlling symbols and controlling
[56:11.200 --> 56:13.240]  what you can say and what you can do.
[56:13.240 --> 56:15.160]  These are authoritarians, extremely dangerous.
[56:15.160 --> 56:19.440]  Now I just covered that, University of Southern California has removed the word field from
[56:19.440 --> 56:23.400]  the curriculum and academic references because it supposedly has racist connotations, no
[56:23.400 --> 56:27.480]  this is not the Babylon B. The University announced that the phrase such as field of
[56:27.480 --> 56:34.720]  study will be replaced by practicum, see it's all the new cult words, in order to advance
[56:34.720 --> 56:36.520]  the cause of anti-racism.
[56:36.520 --> 56:40.600]  So it's the new leftist speak so they know you're following what they're saying and
[56:40.600 --> 56:43.040]  go along with it.
[56:43.040 --> 56:47.600]  Unbelievable and it's not nonsensical, it's cult programming.
[56:47.600 --> 56:52.320]  And we've got another example when we come back of this, remember that member of parliament
[56:52.320 --> 56:56.080]  who got up and read the government statistics about heart attacks increasing from the poison
[56:56.080 --> 56:59.440]  shot which is all confirmed by the CDC?
[56:59.440 --> 57:04.320]  He is being removed from his committee chairmanship in the UK.
[57:04.320 --> 57:12.080]  The prime minister is decrying him as anti-semitic for saying the new holocaust are these poison
[57:12.080 --> 57:17.440]  shots and that Dr. Mingola did unauthorized medical experiments and that this is similar
[57:17.440 --> 57:20.600]  to Joseph Mingola, it is.
[57:20.600 --> 57:25.920]  And now it's anti-semitic if you liken it to what Hitler did, what?
[57:25.920 --> 57:30.360]  See I mean this is next level ladies and gentlemen and this is how they use local correctness
[57:30.360 --> 57:34.360]  for total control, they can carry out their real eugenics operations.
[57:34.360 --> 57:39.560]  The ADL, all these people are the real Nazis, they're as close to Nazis as anything I've
[57:39.560 --> 57:40.560]  ever seen.
[57:40.560 --> 57:51.280]  We'll be right back with our number two straight ahead, infowars.com, tomorrow's news today.

[01:00:12.280 --> 01:00:21.400]  here's the smith's newest report, Ukraine Warpitch, what are you doing over there?
[01:00:21.400 --> 01:00:22.400]  What?
[01:00:22.400 --> 01:00:23.400]  Nothing.
[01:00:23.400 --> 01:00:24.400]  Nothing.
[01:00:24.400 --> 01:00:25.400]  Where?
[01:00:25.400 --> 01:00:26.400]  In Ukraine.
[01:00:26.400 --> 01:00:27.400]  What are you up to?
[01:00:27.400 --> 01:00:28.400]  Ukraine.
[01:00:28.400 --> 01:00:29.400]  What?
[01:00:29.400 --> 01:00:30.400]  Ukraine.
[01:00:30.400 --> 01:00:31.400]  Nothing's happening in Ukraine.
[01:00:31.400 --> 01:00:32.400]  Ukraine of all places.
[01:00:32.400 --> 01:00:34.200]  Where do you get this stuff?
[01:00:34.200 --> 01:00:38.200]  It looks like there's some sort of NATO expansion and a CIA backed coup and something about Joe
[01:00:38.200 --> 01:00:42.960]  Biden with holding a billion dollars is- Want to get impeached?
[01:00:42.960 --> 01:00:43.960]  You can't impeach me.
[01:00:43.960 --> 01:00:44.960]  In that case just shut up.
[01:00:44.960 --> 01:00:46.480]  No, no, I'm not kidding.
[01:00:46.480 --> 01:00:48.680]  It looks like Russia is massing on the border.
[01:00:48.680 --> 01:00:49.680]  Well it's fine.
[01:00:49.680 --> 01:00:50.880]  We're sending Anthony Blinken over there.
[01:00:50.880 --> 01:00:52.880]  Oh, to prevent a war?
[01:00:52.880 --> 01:00:53.880]  No.
[01:00:53.880 --> 01:00:54.880]  Okay, well what's he doing?
[01:00:54.880 --> 01:00:56.880]  He's going over to protect democracy.
[01:00:56.880 --> 01:01:00.360]  Oh, democracy, I love that word.
[01:01:00.360 --> 01:01:01.360]  Terrible news.
[01:01:01.360 --> 01:01:02.360]  Oh no.
[01:01:02.360 --> 01:01:03.360]  Russia invaded Ukraine.
[01:01:03.360 --> 01:01:04.360]  Oh no, why?
[01:01:04.360 --> 01:01:11.160]  Well, because Putin is evil, so because Putin is evil, Putin evil, Zelensky good, not about
[01:01:11.160 --> 01:01:12.160]  sums it up.
[01:01:12.160 --> 01:01:16.120]  Okay, so the largest country in the world decided to invade a country the size of Texas
[01:01:16.120 --> 01:01:20.200]  and the only reason you're giving me is Putin evil, big country, little country.
[01:01:20.200 --> 01:01:21.200]  You get it.
[01:01:21.200 --> 01:01:22.200]  I'm confused.
[01:01:22.200 --> 01:01:27.480]  Well, you don't like the fact that a bigger country invaded a smaller country, do you?
[01:01:27.480 --> 01:01:28.920]  No, I mean I guess not.
[01:01:28.920 --> 01:01:30.120]  Great, you're fully on board.
[01:01:30.120 --> 01:01:31.120]  Here's the Ukrainian flag.
[01:01:31.120 --> 01:01:33.520]  Hey, have you heard about the ghost of Kiev?
[01:01:33.520 --> 01:01:34.880]  She's this lone fighter pilot.
[01:01:34.880 --> 01:01:35.880]  It's protecting the whole city.
[01:01:35.880 --> 01:01:38.040]  He's already downed like six Russian airplanes.
[01:01:38.040 --> 01:01:39.040]  It's incredible.
[01:01:39.040 --> 01:01:40.040]  Whoa, really?
[01:01:40.040 --> 01:01:41.040]  No.
[01:01:41.040 --> 01:01:42.040]  No.
[01:01:42.040 --> 01:01:43.480]  But there are these guys on Snake Island.
[01:01:43.480 --> 01:01:47.400]  When the Russians demanded they surrender, they responded, go f**k yourself.
[01:01:47.400 --> 01:01:48.880]  It's awesome.
[01:01:48.880 --> 01:01:50.880]  Whoa, really?
[01:01:50.880 --> 01:01:51.880]  No.
[01:01:51.880 --> 01:01:53.240]  No, that didn't happen either.
[01:01:53.240 --> 01:01:55.440]  But did you hear about the Russian atrocities?
[01:01:55.440 --> 01:01:57.960]  They are committing war crimes against children.
[01:01:57.960 --> 01:01:59.960]  Oh my God, really?
[01:01:59.960 --> 01:02:00.960]  Nope.
[01:02:00.960 --> 01:02:03.120]  But it doesn't matter because we have to defend Ukraine.
[01:02:03.120 --> 01:02:05.040]  They are our military ally.
[01:02:05.040 --> 01:02:07.400]  I don't actually think they are.
[01:02:07.400 --> 01:02:11.600]  Yeah, well, we're going to do it anyway because after all, we've got to defend democracy.
[01:02:11.600 --> 01:02:13.000]  Okay, so what are we doing to help?
[01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:14.000]  I mean, can we mediate?
[01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:15.000]  We can call for peace.
[01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:17.880]  How many zeros is in a hundred billion?
[01:02:17.880 --> 01:02:20.200]  You're writing them a hundred billion dollar check?
[01:02:20.200 --> 01:02:23.960]  Yeah, I mean, I was writing checks in the tens of millions, but I was running out of
[01:02:23.960 --> 01:02:25.760]  check, so I'll just do one big one.
[01:02:25.760 --> 01:02:26.960]  How much have you sent them?
[01:02:26.960 --> 01:02:28.760]  You mean how much have you sent them?
[01:02:28.760 --> 01:02:29.760]  No idea.
[01:02:29.760 --> 01:02:30.760]  Literally impossible to know.
[01:02:30.760 --> 01:02:32.400]  Okay, well, where's it all going?
[01:02:32.400 --> 01:02:33.400]  Again.
[01:02:33.400 --> 01:02:34.400]  Who knows?
[01:02:34.400 --> 01:02:37.120]  Up in smoke or whatever bombs do.
[01:02:37.120 --> 01:02:39.120]  Okay, that's so much money.
[01:02:39.120 --> 01:02:42.120]  Has there even been an official declaration of war yet?
[01:02:42.120 --> 01:02:43.120]  A what?
[01:02:43.120 --> 01:02:45.320]  I've never even heard of that.
[01:02:45.320 --> 01:02:47.600]  No, there was a declaration that Putin is evil.
[01:02:47.600 --> 01:02:48.880]  I'm sure you heard me.
[01:02:48.880 --> 01:02:51.680]  Yeah, I don't know if I'm really convinced that Putin is evil.
[01:02:51.680 --> 01:02:53.360]  Well, of course Putin is evil.
[01:02:53.360 --> 01:02:57.360]  I mean, if he's not evil, why would he drive our gas prices up so high?
[01:02:57.360 --> 01:02:59.000]  Putin drove our gas prices up?
[01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:02.480]  Well, gas prices are high because of the sanctions that Putin made us put on him.
[01:03:02.480 --> 01:03:03.480]  Oh, sanctions.
[01:03:03.480 --> 01:03:04.480]  So this is hurting Russia.
[01:03:04.480 --> 01:03:05.840]  They've never been better, actually.
[01:03:05.840 --> 01:03:07.560]  Okay, well, what about our oil supply?
[01:03:07.560 --> 01:03:08.560]  No, it's awful.
[01:03:08.560 --> 01:03:11.120]  Actually, we're having to sell our strategic reserves.
[01:03:11.120 --> 01:03:12.120]  You mean use?
[01:03:12.120 --> 01:03:13.120]  No sell.
[01:03:13.120 --> 01:03:14.120]  Sell to who?
[01:03:14.120 --> 01:03:15.120]  China.
[01:03:15.120 --> 01:03:16.120]  You know, our enemy?
[01:03:16.120 --> 01:03:18.480]  Okay, if we're having to sell our strategic reserves, like, why don't we just pump our
[01:03:18.480 --> 01:03:19.480]  own oil?
[01:03:19.480 --> 01:03:20.680]  Don't we have domestic production?
[01:03:20.680 --> 01:03:25.440]  Unfortunately, somebody already banned all of the pipelines and drilling permits, so
[01:03:25.440 --> 01:03:26.440]  can't use it.
[01:03:26.440 --> 01:03:27.440]  Yeah, that was you.
[01:03:27.440 --> 01:03:29.160]  We're going green.
[01:03:29.160 --> 01:03:31.160]  Gas prices have doubled.
[01:03:31.160 --> 01:03:32.280]  It's a transition.
[01:03:32.280 --> 01:03:33.920]  Transition into what?
[01:03:33.920 --> 01:03:34.920]  Transition for climate change.
[01:03:34.920 --> 01:03:36.600]  I thought we were talking about the war in Ukraine.
[01:03:36.600 --> 01:03:37.600]  Oh, right.
[01:03:37.600 --> 01:03:40.720]  Well, the weapons that we're giving Ukraine are extremely fuel efficient.
[01:03:40.720 --> 01:03:46.160]  We can kill thousands for the same amount of emissions as a small SUV, so progress.
[01:03:46.160 --> 01:03:48.160]  And hey, here's some good news.
[01:03:48.160 --> 01:03:50.200]  Somebody just blew up Russia's underwater pipeline.
[01:03:50.200 --> 01:03:52.560]  Oh my God, who?
[01:03:52.560 --> 01:03:53.560]  I don't know.
[01:03:53.560 --> 01:03:54.720]  Who could it be?
[01:03:54.720 --> 01:03:55.880]  No one's going to believe that.
[01:03:55.880 --> 01:03:57.280]  They're going to think you did it.
[01:03:57.280 --> 01:03:58.280]  Me?
[01:03:58.280 --> 01:03:59.840]  The U.S. government?
[01:03:59.840 --> 01:04:01.600]  You know Russia has nukes, right?
[01:04:01.600 --> 01:04:08.760]  Like, is this game of brinksmanship really worth it?
[01:04:08.760 --> 01:04:10.360]  I'm in my bunker now.
[01:04:10.360 --> 01:04:11.360]  It's pretty nice.
[01:04:11.360 --> 01:04:13.800]  What was that last question?
[01:04:13.800 --> 01:04:17.920]  I said, is it really worth this game of nuclear brinksmanship?
[01:04:17.920 --> 01:04:20.800]  All right, folks.
[01:04:20.800 --> 01:04:23.640]  The full video is on infowars.com.
[01:04:23.640 --> 01:04:25.440]  It's going to really wake people up.
[01:04:25.440 --> 01:04:28.320]  The last two videos he did got tens of millions of views.
[01:04:28.320 --> 01:04:29.800]  Joe Rogan retweeted it.
[01:04:29.800 --> 01:04:34.240]  I'm going to send this to Joe here in just a minute, but I need all of you to go to infowars.com
[01:04:34.240 --> 01:04:38.880]  or band.video and get the Ukraine War Pitch meeting and email it out, text message it
[01:04:38.880 --> 01:04:39.880]  out to everybody you know.
[01:04:39.880 --> 01:04:46.120]  Now, Twitter is still only support infowars by spreading that link, but we have theinfowar.tv.
[01:04:46.120 --> 01:04:53.360]  Theinfowar.tv, you go there, it's band.video, all those URLs, they're not blocking them.
[01:04:53.360 --> 01:05:00.760]  So share the Ukraine War Pitch meeting.
[01:05:00.760 --> 01:05:05.200]  Everyone watching should realize that this is an information war and it takes money to
[01:05:05.200 --> 01:05:06.720]  fund an information war.
[01:05:06.720 --> 01:05:11.200]  And everyone should decide to take the fight to the next level and to take the fight to
[01:05:11.200 --> 01:05:15.680]  the very tip of the spear and ensure we stand the field in this war against the new order
[01:05:15.680 --> 01:05:19.560]  by visiting infowars.com right now and taking action.
[01:05:19.560 --> 01:05:23.360]  I thank you for your past support and I ask you now to count the cost and realize that
[01:05:23.360 --> 01:05:28.160]  only your commitment to keep infowars on the air will ensure our victory against the new
[01:05:28.160 --> 01:05:29.160]  world order.
[01:05:29.160 --> 01:05:32.960]  They're coming for you and your family, they're coming for me, they're coming for the children,
[01:05:32.960 --> 01:05:35.560]  but to get to the children, they've got to get through us first.
[01:05:35.560 --> 01:05:38.840]  These monsters are all over television wanting to give these shots to newborn babies.
[01:05:38.840 --> 01:05:43.000]  They're already given to the pregnant women, miscarriages are off the chart, 80 plus percent
[01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:47.960]  increase in miscarriages in the first two prime ministers after these poison shots.
[01:05:47.960 --> 01:05:51.960]  We can and will save the children and they are counting on us.
[01:05:51.960 --> 01:05:52.960]  Let's do it together.
[01:05:52.960 --> 01:05:57.600]  And the fight starts at infowars.com and the fight continues with your financial support
[01:05:57.600 --> 01:05:58.600]  at infowarsstore.com.
[01:05:58.600 --> 01:05:59.600]  Now take action now.
[01:05:59.600 --> 01:06:00.600]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:06:00.600 --> 01:06:11.600]  It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the info war.
[01:06:11.600 --> 01:06:35.880]  We are now into hour number two, broadcasting worldwide, we're taking your calls this hour.
[01:06:35.880 --> 01:06:40.320]  The toll free number to join us is 877-789-2539.
[01:06:40.320 --> 01:06:50.000]  Talk radio slash news on radio on TV and on the internet at infowars.com forward slash
[01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:51.000]  show.
[01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:59.120]  All right, so I already covered last hour just one example of total brainwashing by
[01:06:59.120 --> 01:07:03.680]  design and most of the red state and town hall articles were all the crazy liberals
[01:07:03.680 --> 01:07:07.440]  have banned the word field and they've banned the word brown bag and they've banned the
[01:07:07.440 --> 01:07:13.040]  word lynch even in people's last names and two men can have a baby and they're just idiots.
[01:07:13.040 --> 01:07:14.040]  They're morons.
[01:07:14.040 --> 01:07:16.080]  They want to ban your gas stoves because they're stupid.
[01:07:16.080 --> 01:07:19.080]  No, they want total control, total enslavement.
[01:07:19.080 --> 01:07:22.000]  They admit that's their plan, a post industrial world.
[01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:27.160]  So now the University of Southern California has removed the word field from their academic
[01:07:27.160 --> 01:07:31.440]  textbooks and from discussion and from their curriculum.
[01:07:31.440 --> 01:07:35.760]  The new word is practicum.
[01:07:35.760 --> 01:07:36.760]  That's what you're supposed to use.
[01:07:36.760 --> 01:07:39.160]  It's about a cult taking control of the language.
[01:07:39.160 --> 01:07:42.320]  Well, there's other forms of this brainwashing.
[01:07:42.320 --> 01:07:45.920]  The British government was the first to start giving the poison shots two and a half years
[01:07:45.920 --> 01:07:52.480]  ago and right away the federal watchdog agency there said we want to issue a yellow notice
[01:07:52.480 --> 01:07:57.360]  but they've blocked the law that we're the regulatory power and just given an emergency
[01:07:57.360 --> 01:08:02.400]  authorization but we think there should be a yellow notice meaning pull the shots.
[01:08:02.400 --> 01:08:05.000]  That was two years ago, six months after they started.
[01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:09.320]  Then they said don't give it to children, don't give it to the elderly, on and on and
[01:08:09.320 --> 01:08:10.320]  on.
[01:08:10.320 --> 01:08:14.160]  Now it's come out in their national health service and it's come out in our CDC that
[01:08:14.160 --> 01:08:18.720]  they knew all along and we're covering it up and now the documents from Pfizer and the
[01:08:18.720 --> 01:08:24.120]  CDC have all come out in the last few months, new documents just two days ago.
[01:08:24.120 --> 01:08:27.080]  And so then what came out of that?
[01:08:27.080 --> 01:08:32.960]  Well, a member of parliament, conservative British, remember a parliament punished and
[01:08:32.960 --> 01:08:37.640]  under investigation for tweet exposing COVID vaccines.
[01:08:37.640 --> 01:08:44.120]  The articles on infowars.com United Kingdom MP Andrew Bridgen has been suspended from
[01:08:44.120 --> 01:08:50.000]  sitting as a conservative MP, wow suspended, they're nixing out the voters, had a conservative
[01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:55.360]  whip removed and will now serve without a party affiliation until a formal investigation
[01:08:55.360 --> 01:08:58.040]  is completed.
[01:08:58.040 --> 01:09:04.560]  Mr. Bridgen's crime was simply tweeting a zero hedge article detailing America CDC statistics
[01:09:04.560 --> 01:09:08.120]  showing COVID jabs are far more dangerous than previously reported.
[01:09:08.120 --> 01:09:14.800]  Along with this article, Bridgen wrote as one consultant, cardiologist said to me this
[01:09:14.800 --> 01:09:19.040]  is the biggest crime against humanity since the Holocaust.
[01:09:19.040 --> 01:09:23.880]  And so the left said oh he's attacking Jews, thought of the Holocaust, you can't use the
[01:09:23.880 --> 01:09:30.640]  word unless you're Jewish and the prime minister came out and said yes, he's an anti-Semite,
[01:09:30.640 --> 01:09:32.760]  a terrible man.
[01:09:32.760 --> 01:09:39.120]  None of that makes sense, that's insane, that's crazy and it's meant to be insane.
[01:09:39.120 --> 01:09:43.520]  It's meant to tell you, you come out and criticize these shots and the murderers that rolled it
[01:09:43.520 --> 01:09:46.680]  out, we're going to destroy you.
[01:09:46.680 --> 01:09:51.840]  But here's the good news, this intimidation is not working.
[01:09:51.840 --> 01:09:58.080]  Here's the tweet that's getting him basically run out of parliament as one consultant, cardiologist
[01:09:58.080 --> 01:10:01.320]  said to me this is the biggest crime against humanity since the Holocaust.
[01:10:01.320 --> 01:10:05.520]  He's saying the Holocaust happened, he's saying it was a huge crime.
[01:10:05.520 --> 01:10:08.920]  Not good enough, anti-Semite.
[01:10:08.920 --> 01:10:15.280]  Matt Hancock, the disgraced UK health secretary who locked the nation down during COVID erupted
[01:10:15.280 --> 01:10:20.520]  at Bridgen on Wednesday telling the prime minister the tweet was disgusting, anti-Semitic, I'm
[01:10:20.520 --> 01:10:25.120]  quoting it, anti-vax conspiracy theory that is deeply offensive anti-Semitic.
[01:10:25.120 --> 01:10:31.960]  Prime minister Rishi Sunak agreed with his friend Hancock and condemned the MP as unacceptable
[01:10:31.960 --> 01:10:39.840]  language and pledged to eradicate the scourge of anti-Semitism.
[01:10:39.840 --> 01:10:45.040]  They know what they're doing but it's not working, all the information is coming out.
[01:10:45.040 --> 01:10:50.160]  But oh, we're going to call you a racist, oh we're going to call you a Nazi.
[01:10:50.160 --> 01:10:57.000]  While they carry out policies that are as close to the Nazis as I've seen in my lifetime.
[01:10:57.000 --> 01:11:00.360]  Now let's go over some more of these articles and I'll go to your phone calls.
[01:11:00.360 --> 01:11:04.680]  FDA no longer needs to require animal tests before human drug trials.
[01:11:04.680 --> 01:11:11.200]  What did Fauci say four years ago on C-SPAN?
[01:11:11.200 --> 01:11:14.840]  Before they released COVID, before all of it, he said we need a virus out of China, maybe
[01:11:14.840 --> 01:11:21.520]  a SARS virus, play the club 100 times to blow up the old FDA and approval system similarly
[01:11:21.520 --> 01:11:27.480]  worldwide and just get automatic emergency authorization to any mRNA we want.
[01:11:27.480 --> 01:11:31.440]  What did Netanyahu a month ago with Jordan Peterson say?
[01:11:31.440 --> 01:11:33.520]  We played the club many times.
[01:11:33.520 --> 01:11:38.560]  He said Israel are lab rats, Israel is a giant laboratory, I've turned the Israeli people
[01:11:38.560 --> 01:11:44.800]  over to Pfizer and others to now conduct all sorts of new mRNA so we find out what it does.
[01:11:44.800 --> 01:11:47.520]  We'll find out if it hurts you or if it helps you.
[01:11:47.520 --> 01:11:49.400]  What did the FDA board members say?
[01:11:49.400 --> 01:11:52.760]  We've got to just go ahead and authorize this for kids, we don't know what it'll do, we'll
[01:11:52.760 --> 01:11:57.840]  just authorize it like we did this other vaccine that killed a bunch of people.
[01:11:57.840 --> 01:12:01.560]  See there's a moment where they've got to just normalize all this and like yeah 5G gives
[01:12:01.560 --> 01:12:06.520]  you cancer, yeah it causes basically asthma like events in their own studies and rat studies
[01:12:06.520 --> 01:12:09.480]  and human studies, yeah.
[01:12:09.480 --> 01:12:13.860]  But oh because it's too obvious with the rats, we just don't even do the studies anymore,
[01:12:13.860 --> 01:12:17.680]  we go directly to you and then cover up the results.
[01:12:17.680 --> 01:12:21.040]  Total weaponization, this is what an attack looks like.
[01:12:21.040 --> 01:12:24.280]  So I told you this is what was coming and it was slipped in a bill, it was passed in
[01:12:24.280 --> 01:12:27.160]  the last Congress in December.
[01:12:27.160 --> 01:12:28.160]  Science.org.
[01:12:28.160 --> 01:12:33.360]  FDA no longer needs to require animal tests before human drug trials and the new drug trials
[01:12:33.360 --> 01:12:39.520]  they say will be done by emergency edict and will go directly to the public.
[01:12:39.520 --> 01:12:43.560]  But because there are never any real trials, no one can ever prove what's happening even
[01:12:43.560 --> 01:12:45.680]  though the death rates explode.
[01:12:45.680 --> 01:12:52.680]  Think of the super ultra diabolical nature of that.
[01:12:52.680 --> 01:12:54.960]  Another big report on infowars.com.
[01:12:54.960 --> 01:13:00.280]  Company population kill plan admitted by CDC as VAERS data released.
[01:13:00.280 --> 01:13:04.000]  Former Chief Scientist at Pfizer says it's a deliberate plan.
[01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:07.040]  Another big article from the Brownstone Institute on infowars.com.
[01:13:07.040 --> 01:13:12.280]  How can we trust institutions that lied and it's a big thick article and it goes over
[01:13:12.280 --> 01:13:16.280]  how they premeditatedly lied, knew they were lying and suppressed people telling the truth
[01:13:16.280 --> 01:13:20.080]  to carry out their deadly lie.
[01:13:20.080 --> 01:13:22.120]  Absolutely over the top.
[01:13:22.120 --> 01:13:26.800]  The good news as MTG said last hour here live with us, she's calling for an immediate investigation
[01:13:26.800 --> 01:13:29.680]  including a criminal investigation, a surge of sudden deaths.
[01:13:29.680 --> 01:13:33.560]  She told me a lot of inside baseball that I can't reveal to you yet but it is going
[01:13:33.560 --> 01:13:37.880]  to be criminal investigations not just by Congress looking at the criminality and calling
[01:13:37.880 --> 01:13:42.200]  for charges and referring charges to the Justice Department but it's going to be even more
[01:13:42.200 --> 01:13:45.480]  that's about to be announced by other states not just Florida.
[01:13:45.480 --> 01:13:46.480]  The dam is breaking.
[01:13:46.480 --> 01:13:50.240]  Here's what I mentioned earlier so you can actually go watch the powerful interview
[01:13:50.240 --> 01:13:51.740]  and analysis.
[01:13:51.740 --> 01:13:57.000]  COVID shots are toxic depopulation weapon being calibrated for mass culling.
[01:13:57.000 --> 01:13:58.240]  That's on Band-Aid video.
[01:13:58.240 --> 01:14:02.720]  Our lives depend on you getting it and sharing it but a lot of sites block the URL Band-Aid
[01:14:02.720 --> 01:14:03.720]  video.
[01:14:03.720 --> 01:14:14.240]  That's why you use the info war, theinfowar.tv, theinfowar.tv, theinfowar.tv and they're
[01:14:14.240 --> 01:14:20.080]  not censoring that URL yet but we're about to launch an even more powerful URL that
[01:14:20.080 --> 01:14:25.040]  is again the whole site of Band-Aid video creating new links so you can send them out.
[01:14:25.040 --> 01:14:29.440]  You go to the same site, the same site, the same videos just a different URL.
[01:14:29.440 --> 01:14:30.960]  So very, very important.
[01:14:30.960 --> 01:14:35.200]  Coming to see here Air Force Connect 21 among several young people who died suddenly in
[01:14:35.200 --> 01:14:37.400]  past few days of heart attacks.
[01:14:37.400 --> 01:14:38.400]  But that's okay.
[01:14:38.400 --> 01:14:40.720]  Let's play this clip from Greta Thunberg.
[01:14:40.720 --> 01:14:45.760]  Greta Thunberg advises us to listen to the science and experts during COVID which we're
[01:14:45.760 --> 01:14:47.960]  all lying to us following a script.
[01:14:47.960 --> 01:14:48.960]  Here it is.
[01:14:48.960 --> 01:14:51.480]  Hi, my name is Greta Thunberg.
[01:14:51.480 --> 01:14:57.160]  I am a climate and environment activist speaking to you from my couch in Stockholm, Sweden.
[01:14:57.160 --> 01:15:01.840]  I want to send all my love and support to everyone who is struggling in these difficult
[01:15:01.840 --> 01:15:07.480]  times and to everyone who is working on the front lines to keep the rest of us safe.
[01:15:07.480 --> 01:15:12.400]  We are right now in a crisis and we cannot solve any crisis without treating it as a
[01:15:12.400 --> 01:15:14.160]  crisis.
[01:15:14.160 --> 01:15:18.840]  We now must put our differences aside and cooperate and listen to the science and the
[01:15:18.840 --> 01:15:23.280]  experts as in every emergency.
[01:15:23.280 --> 01:15:28.120]  He has to stand together in solidarity and leave no one behind.
[01:15:28.120 --> 01:15:33.560]  And then when this is finally over, we must start building real sustainable societies
[01:15:33.560 --> 01:15:35.720]  within the planetary boundaries.
[01:15:35.720 --> 01:15:36.720]  Thank you so much.
[01:15:36.720 --> 01:15:38.960]  I wish you a great evening.
[01:15:38.960 --> 01:15:40.640]  Translated, my parents are Antifa.
[01:15:40.640 --> 01:15:42.000]  I'm a globalist front person.
[01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:46.400]  There are too many of you take the deadly shot, but believe me, I'm not taking them suckers.
[01:15:46.400 --> 01:15:48.800]  Meanwhile, powerful video, Robert F. Kennedy Jr.
[01:15:48.800 --> 01:15:50.920]  Pfizer knew they were going to kill a lot of people.
[01:15:50.920 --> 01:15:55.240]  I'm going to play that video when we come back and then go right to your phone calls.
[01:15:55.240 --> 01:16:00.040]  Sage, Steve, Todd, Dave, Laurie, Ian.
[01:16:00.040 --> 01:16:04.040]  Ladies and gentlemen, a very exciting development has just taken place.
[01:16:04.040 --> 01:16:09.080]  I want to encourage you all to go to mforestore.com and check it out for yourself because it is
[01:16:09.080 --> 01:16:13.080]  a very strong, high quality formula.
[01:16:13.080 --> 01:16:17.920]  Gallon out, sleep support, liquid is very fast acting, taking out of the tongue.
[01:16:17.920 --> 01:16:24.200]  It's got a very good dose of melatonin, passion flower, valerian root extract, lemon balm
[01:16:24.200 --> 01:16:26.200]  and German chamomile.
[01:16:26.200 --> 01:16:31.880]  All of these compounds are documented on record to help give you deeper, cleaner, healthier
[01:16:31.880 --> 01:16:35.960]  sleep and that is one of the biggest game changers out there with all the stress we
[01:16:35.960 --> 01:16:36.960]  have in this world.
[01:16:36.960 --> 01:16:39.800]  And we've got some other great sleep eggs as well and they're excellent.
[01:16:39.800 --> 01:16:45.240]  They're all different formulas, but this one is particularly the strongest one we have.
[01:16:45.240 --> 01:16:50.520]  So Gallon out, sold out for more than five months, is now back available at mforestore.com.
[01:16:50.520 --> 01:16:56.720]  So get better, deeper rest, boost your immune system and support the mfore war with Gallon
[01:16:56.720 --> 01:16:59.440]  out, sleep support and mfore store.
[01:16:59.440 --> 01:17:02.800]  There's a war against our masculinity.
[01:17:02.800 --> 01:17:07.400]  There's a war in the environment, the food, the water, the air, the electromagnetics,
[01:17:07.400 --> 01:17:13.160]  the injections to really cut us off from what God designed us to be.
[01:17:13.160 --> 01:17:19.440]  Through mother nature, the creator gave us compounds that can counteract what the globalists
[01:17:19.440 --> 01:17:20.440]  have done.
[01:17:20.440 --> 01:17:24.720]  And I got to tell you, all our supplements are great, but we've got a real game changer
[01:17:24.720 --> 01:17:25.720]  now.
[01:17:25.720 --> 01:17:28.000]  We've never put anything out this powerful.
[01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:34.120]  It's Mfore Wars Platinum, now exclusively available at 40% off at mforestore.com.
[01:17:34.120 --> 01:17:38.320]  This is private labeled three of the top best sellers in the country right now, but it's
[01:17:38.320 --> 01:17:43.800]  exclusively available under the brand name and private label of Mfore Wars Platinum at
[01:17:43.800 --> 01:17:44.800]  mforestore.com.
[01:17:44.800 --> 01:17:52.760]  It's HGH Boost Max, it's Pain MD, and it's 1776 testosterone boost.
[01:17:52.760 --> 01:17:57.200]  You owe it to yourself and your way of life and your well-being to try these out and fund
[01:17:57.200 --> 01:17:59.560]  the Mfore War.
[01:17:59.560 --> 01:18:03.520]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are now launching the most powerful supplements in the history
[01:18:03.520 --> 01:18:08.680]  of Mfore Wars under a new brand name, Mfore Wars Platinum.
[01:18:08.680 --> 01:18:13.400]  Now all three of these revolutionary products you see in front of you are already number
[01:18:13.400 --> 01:18:18.440]  one best sellers in the market for the last few years because they work so well.
[01:18:18.440 --> 01:18:22.480]  We've gone right to the manufacturer who are listeners, the owners of fan, and they've
[01:18:22.480 --> 01:18:28.360]  given us this huge deal off of retail, 40% off what these products are found for under
[01:18:28.360 --> 01:18:30.400]  other names.
[01:18:30.400 --> 01:18:35.240]  And not just under one name, they sell these under three or four other brands that other
[01:18:35.240 --> 01:18:37.440]  major distributors and suppliers have put out.
[01:18:37.440 --> 01:18:42.000]  The difference is we have it for 40% off what it is in stores.
[01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:46.560]  We're talking about Pain MD, we're talking about HGH Max Boost.
[01:18:46.560 --> 01:18:49.440]  We're talking about 1776 testosterone boost.
[01:18:49.440 --> 01:18:51.040]  These things are incredible.
[01:18:51.040 --> 01:18:54.880]  I would suggest you take half a dose or less what you first do and consult your health
[01:18:54.880 --> 01:18:59.800]  care provider because they're so powerful, get them at mforestore.com.

[01:19:06.400 --> 01:19:08.760]  are sold for in stores.
[01:19:08.760 --> 01:19:13.040]  It's Mfore Wars MD exclusively available at mforestore.com.
[01:19:13.040 --> 01:19:19.760]  We have a new line of super quality CBD oils that are incredibly good for your entire body

[01:20:01.520 --> 01:20:10.880]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:20:10.880 --> 01:20:23.680]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen, I'm Alex Jones, your host, and we're saving a lot
[01:20:23.680 --> 01:20:25.520]  of lives right now.
[01:20:25.520 --> 01:20:29.680]  They tried to censor us, they surveilled us, they attacked us, they came after so many
[01:20:29.680 --> 01:20:34.480]  great people, they censored you, but the truth's coming out about the poison shots and that
[01:20:34.480 --> 01:20:39.400]  means their whole agenda will fail, the World ID, a biomedical tyranny, forced injections.
[01:20:39.400 --> 01:20:43.040]  Your phone calls are coming up in a moment, but here's Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a true hero.
[01:20:43.040 --> 01:20:45.440]  Pfizer knew they were going to kill a lot of people.
[01:20:45.440 --> 01:20:47.040]  The documents now show.
[01:20:47.040 --> 01:20:48.040]  Here it is.
[01:20:48.040 --> 01:20:51.720]  We've never seen these kind of adverse reactions.
[01:20:51.720 --> 01:20:55.400]  They were predictable because if you look at the clinical trial data, even though they
[01:20:55.400 --> 01:20:58.800]  lied on the clinical trial data, Pfizer lied.
[01:20:58.800 --> 01:20:59.800]  We know that.
[01:20:59.800 --> 01:21:02.480]  There's no doubt about it.
[01:21:02.480 --> 01:21:05.080]  You know, Maddie DeGerry is a good example.
[01:21:05.080 --> 01:21:10.360]  She was one of 1,100 children in the 11 to 15-year-old trial.
[01:21:10.360 --> 01:21:17.760]  So they're going to give this to 76 million children based on these tiny trials.
[01:21:17.760 --> 01:21:24.840]  So any signal that you see in those trials you have to assume is going to reverberate.
[01:21:24.840 --> 01:21:28.800]  You can extrapolate to the much larger group.
[01:21:28.800 --> 01:21:36.600]  Maddie DeGerry got a fever immediately after her vaccine, and she later gets seizures,
[01:21:36.600 --> 01:21:42.560]  and now she's in a wheelchair apparently for life, and she's on a feeding tube.
[01:21:42.560 --> 01:21:50.760]  That's a fate worse than death, and it's to a cohort that has zero risk of dying of COVID.
[01:21:50.760 --> 01:21:56.560]  And if they give this to 76 million kids, they can expect that an injury like that will occur
[01:21:56.560 --> 01:21:58.920]  in one in every 1,100 kids.
[01:21:58.920 --> 01:22:04.760]  It's not guaranteed, but that's what Pfizer, when you do the clinical trial, that is how
[01:22:04.760 --> 01:22:05.760]  it works.
[01:22:05.760 --> 01:22:08.520]  You extrapolate any injury to the population as all.
[01:22:08.520 --> 01:22:15.240]  So that's 70,000 kids or something like that who could be injured in that terrible way.
[01:22:15.240 --> 01:22:20.560]  Kids who are at zero risk from COVID plus, the heart attacks we're seeing, the strokes
[01:22:20.560 --> 01:22:29.880]  from this vaccine are, there's been more deaths in eight months, and in all the billions
[01:22:29.880 --> 01:22:36.480]  of vaccines combined over the last 30 years from this one vaccine, 17,000 recorded deaths
[01:22:36.480 --> 01:22:42.240]  in the United States, and we know the death rates are much, much higher than that.
[01:22:42.240 --> 01:22:49.440]  Probably 40 times the best math, the best studies are showing that it's 40 times that.
[01:22:49.440 --> 01:22:56.120]  Oh, you know, the risk from the vaccine are completely untenable.
[01:22:56.120 --> 01:23:00.760]  If people knew the truth, they would not be taking this vaccine, and then the benefits
[01:23:00.760 --> 01:23:07.320]  of the vaccine are apparently zero or even sub-zero after six months on the British data
[01:23:07.320 --> 01:23:14.000]  showing that the people who are vaccinated are actually more likely in many age categories
[01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:25.560]  to get COVID than people who are unvaccinated, which, by the way, was predicted now.
[01:23:25.560 --> 01:23:30.120]  We know that Pfizer knew this was going to happen because in their clinical trial that
[01:23:30.120 --> 01:23:34.120]  were among, in a six-month clinical trial, it was only six months.
[01:23:34.120 --> 01:23:40.720]  At the end of that period, 20 people died in the vaccine group and only 14 in the placebo
[01:23:40.720 --> 01:23:45.120]  group of all cause mortality.
[01:23:45.120 --> 01:23:49.480]  There were five heart attacks in the vaccine group and only one in the placebo group.
[01:23:49.480 --> 01:23:55.640]  So your chance of dying of a heart attack in the vaccine, according to their own studies,
[01:23:55.640 --> 01:23:58.280]  is 500% greater than if you're unvaccinated.
[01:23:58.280 --> 01:24:04.160]  So they knew we were going to kill a lot of people, and they did in any way.
[01:24:04.160 --> 01:24:11.280]  And people need to be able to see those studies and understand the deception, this criminal
[01:24:11.280 --> 01:24:15.160]  deception that has been imposed upon them.
[01:24:15.160 --> 01:24:20.640]  A criminal deception that has been imposed upon us, and we have the former head scientist
[01:24:20.640 --> 01:24:25.600]  at Pfizer saying the exact same thing because it's a fact, that's why this broadcast is
[01:24:25.600 --> 01:24:26.600]  so important.
[01:24:26.600 --> 01:24:28.920]  That's why you share in the articles, the video is so important, because people are
[01:24:28.920 --> 01:24:31.840]  really starting to wake up and we're close to defeating these people.
[01:24:31.840 --> 01:24:36.200]  I'm going to go to your calls in a moment, but as I told you, we're fun about viewers
[01:24:36.200 --> 01:24:37.560]  like you.
[01:24:37.560 --> 01:24:41.400]  We had thousands and thousands of people by signed copies of the Great Reset in the War
[01:24:41.400 --> 01:24:43.520]  for the World.
[01:24:43.520 --> 01:24:46.320]  And it really helped us stay on here.
[01:24:46.320 --> 01:24:48.880]  And I've said we're going to have this come to an end now.
[01:24:48.880 --> 01:24:55.880]  There are 1400 books left that we have that are to be signed.
[01:24:55.880 --> 01:24:57.440]  And I signed 500 of them this week.
[01:24:57.440 --> 01:25:01.920]  I'm going to sign another 500 this weekend, another 300, 400 on Monday.
[01:25:01.920 --> 01:25:02.920]  They'll go into the warehouse.
[01:25:02.920 --> 01:25:05.200]  They've already got 300 signed in the warehouse.
[01:25:05.200 --> 01:25:10.520]  And those 1400, 1500 books, I forget the exact number, are gone.
[01:25:10.520 --> 01:25:14.880]  I'm never going to sign another one of these books again.
[01:25:14.880 --> 01:25:18.280]  We are going to put one out that has a piece of art I'm going to do, but I haven't done
[01:25:18.280 --> 01:25:19.280]  it yet in the future.
[01:25:19.280 --> 01:25:24.360]  That will be a limited run at patreoncollectibles.com or 7076coin.com.
[01:25:24.360 --> 01:25:28.840]  But for just a simple signed book to know that you are part of the fundraiser, you help
[01:25:28.840 --> 01:25:35.120]  keep us on air in a memento of history, we're going to sign less than 1500 more of these
[01:25:35.120 --> 01:25:36.320]  and that's it.
[01:25:36.320 --> 01:25:39.080]  And that will really help us stay on air.
[01:25:39.080 --> 01:25:43.560]  You'll just take action and go buy a signed book and an unsigned to give to the library
[01:25:43.560 --> 01:25:48.080]  or whatever you like, the unsigned are $20 something, hardcover, the Death Star plans
[01:25:48.080 --> 01:25:51.920]  to the new World Order, the Great Reset in the War for the World, and then fullwarsword.com.
[01:25:51.920 --> 01:25:57.560]  The signed are $99, not just like NPR where they sell a ball cap for $50 or a t-shirt
[01:25:57.560 --> 01:26:02.760]  for $100 or a coffee mug for $50, everybody knows the coffee cup didn't cost $50 or $20.
[01:26:02.760 --> 01:26:04.680]  It means you were part of the pledge drive.
[01:26:04.680 --> 01:26:09.960]  We don't get billions like NPR and PBS, we get nothing from taxpayers.
[01:26:09.960 --> 01:26:13.680]  But via your free will, you get this historic book that went to number one in the world
[01:26:13.680 --> 01:26:16.680]  off and on for the first month of its sale, it's still in the top 100, it's still in the
[01:26:16.680 --> 01:26:19.440]  top 10 books on political science.
[01:26:19.440 --> 01:26:22.840]  The Great Reset in the War for the World is the true rulers of the planet.
[01:26:22.840 --> 01:26:25.760]  Have the signed book, know that you support the broadcast.
[01:26:25.760 --> 01:26:27.240]  I thank you for your support.
[01:26:27.240 --> 01:26:31.440]  Please go to mfullwarsword.com right now and get the Great Reset in the War for the World
[01:26:31.440 --> 01:26:36.480]  and I am going to sign the last 800 or so that I haven't signed yet and then that, ladies
[01:26:36.480 --> 01:26:44.640]  and gentlemen, is it and I'm going to sign 23 on this one because we're in the year 2023.
[01:26:44.640 --> 01:26:49.720]  One of the ones you're beginning, I signed last year, so they say 2022, but when they're
[01:26:49.720 --> 01:26:54.800]  gone, they are gone and again, I thank you all for your support.
[01:26:54.800 --> 01:27:03.280]  Take action at mfullwarsword.com and if you'd like to support the broadcast, you can also
[01:27:03.280 --> 01:27:06.200]  get great supplements to support your immune system and your body.
[01:27:06.200 --> 01:27:08.680]  The Real Red Pill Plus is going to sell out soon.
[01:27:08.680 --> 01:27:09.680]  Despite that, it's 50% off.
[01:27:09.680 --> 01:27:14.320]  Don't have time to tell you about it, go research the Real Red Pill Plus at mfullwarsword.com
[01:27:14.320 --> 01:27:15.880]  and down and out.
[01:27:15.880 --> 01:27:20.480]  Our strongest sleep aid is also back in stock, 40% off.
[01:27:20.480 --> 01:27:22.520]  Okay, let's do this.
[01:27:22.520 --> 01:27:24.240]  Let me hit a few more of the vaccine news stories.
[01:27:24.240 --> 01:27:25.240]  I go over to break.
[01:27:25.240 --> 01:27:26.600]  Come right back with your phone calls.
[01:27:26.600 --> 01:27:31.520]  Moderna CEO announces new mRNA shot to treat heart failure in patients.
[01:27:31.520 --> 01:27:35.520]  Wow, there's suddenly all this massive heart failure and all these people and they've got
[01:27:35.520 --> 01:27:37.280]  a drug that counters the blood clots.
[01:27:37.280 --> 01:27:41.680]  Man, that's really, now you know why they wanted one four times stronger than Pfizer.
[01:27:41.680 --> 01:27:43.080]  It's the exact same shot.
[01:27:43.080 --> 01:27:44.560]  That's four times stronger.
[01:27:44.560 --> 01:27:48.640]  If you want to have a heart attack, folks, take Moderna.
[01:27:48.640 --> 01:27:55.440]  White House confirms Biden aids located Obama-Eric classified documents at two locations in his
[01:27:55.440 --> 01:27:56.440]  home.
[01:27:56.440 --> 01:27:59.680]  Boom, caught red-handed, said he didn't know who left the documents at the college.
[01:27:59.680 --> 01:28:02.160]  Now they found them pretending to come into China.
[01:28:02.160 --> 01:28:04.160]  Treason.
[01:28:04.160 --> 01:28:08.360]  But as MTG said earlier, this is them getting ready to carry out the garbage and get Gavin
[01:28:08.360 --> 01:28:09.360]  Newsome ready.
[01:28:09.360 --> 01:28:13.240]  And as much as I hate Biden, they're only bringing this out now because he's already stolen
[01:28:13.240 --> 01:28:14.240]  the election.
[01:28:14.240 --> 01:28:19.160]  Tucker Carlson, Biden-classified docs and U-Pen's China ties.
[01:28:19.160 --> 01:28:21.320]  And it goes on and on from there.
[01:28:21.320 --> 01:28:25.080]  That is such an incredibly important issue.
[01:28:25.080 --> 01:28:29.200]  Red-handed reveals China's donations to the University of Pennsylvania short at the Biden
[01:28:29.200 --> 01:28:30.440]  Center announcement.
[01:28:30.440 --> 01:28:34.480]  The building he was in was paid for by the Communist Chinese government.
[01:28:34.480 --> 01:28:41.160]  But Joy Behar, prostitute, Schill says Biden should be given benefit of the doubt for taking
[01:28:41.160 --> 01:28:42.480]  classified docs.
[01:28:42.480 --> 01:28:45.120]  When he did it, it's illegal because the vice president can't do it.
[01:28:45.120 --> 01:28:46.880]  He did it before he was president.
[01:28:46.880 --> 01:28:49.200]  Infowars.com, Tamara's News.
[01:28:49.200 --> 01:28:54.480]  Today, your phone calls are straight ahead on the other side.
[01:28:54.480 --> 01:28:55.480]  Stay with us.
[01:28:55.480 --> 01:29:04.080]  Like a rock thrown into a pond, your actions, you know they may seem little, have a massive
[01:29:04.080 --> 01:29:06.480]  ripple effect throughout time and space.
[01:29:06.480 --> 01:29:08.120]  We're actually winning the Infowar.
[01:29:08.120 --> 01:29:13.000]  And when you realize that Band-Aught Video has hundreds and hundreds of censored directors
[01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:18.520]  and investigative journalists and talk show hosts, this information is beyond incredible.
[01:29:18.520 --> 01:29:22.760]  Hundreds of medical doctors and scientists, all of them right now telling the truth at
[01:29:22.760 --> 01:29:24.160]  Band-Aught Video.
[01:29:24.160 --> 01:29:26.560]  Millions of people today visiting Band-Aught Video.
[01:29:26.560 --> 01:29:31.320]  But you can take that information and cause a bigger ripple effect, an amplifying effect,
[01:29:31.320 --> 01:29:36.160]  and make sure it gets out to your friends, your family, your neighbors, and perfect strangers.
[01:29:36.160 --> 01:29:38.680]  You are the modern Paul Revere's.
[01:29:38.680 --> 01:29:41.840]  You are what takes our information and amplifies it.
[01:29:41.840 --> 01:29:47.080]  When you decide to take action, we as a species and as a race are invincible.
[01:29:47.080 --> 01:29:52.000]  So I thank you all for your past action, and I challenge you to redouble your efforts now
[01:29:52.000 --> 01:29:59.880]  because humanity and the children are counting on you.
[01:29:59.880 --> 01:30:01.560]  Infowars is winning.
[01:30:01.560 --> 01:30:03.560]  Infowars is reaching more people than ever.
[01:30:03.560 --> 01:30:06.320]  We were supposed to be off the air months and months and months ago.
[01:30:06.320 --> 01:30:09.080]  Mainstream media told you, but it's not true.
[01:30:09.080 --> 01:30:11.200]  They told you we were going to be shut down.
[01:30:11.200 --> 01:30:13.240]  They told you we owed a billion and a half dollars.
[01:30:13.240 --> 01:30:14.240]  None of that's true.
[01:30:14.240 --> 01:30:15.600]  It's all being appealed.
[01:30:15.600 --> 01:30:17.760]  They want you to think Infowars is dead.
[01:30:17.760 --> 01:30:22.680]  But if you simply stand up and support Infowars, we've got years and years of appeals, and
[01:30:22.680 --> 01:30:24.600]  we will not be taken off the air.
[01:30:24.600 --> 01:30:28.240]  But if they convince you that we've been shut down, they're going to win.
[01:30:28.240 --> 01:30:30.680]  But let the globalist sigh up you and your family.
[01:30:30.680 --> 01:30:35.160]  Go to infowarstore.com and get incredible products, supplements, books, films, t-shirts.
[01:30:35.160 --> 01:30:36.160]  You name it.

[01:30:39.920 --> 01:30:40.920]  not worked.
[01:30:40.920 --> 01:30:42.480]  Thanks for keeping us on the air.

[01:31:59.680 --> 01:32:04.520]  So when I first started taking survival shield, basically I was 275 pounds, I was overweight.
[01:32:04.520 --> 01:32:06.880]  I had brain fog like you wouldn't believe.
[01:32:06.880 --> 01:32:11.440]  I was barely holding onto a job and I heard Dr. Group on your show and I listened to it.
[01:32:11.440 --> 01:32:14.840]  So the first one I got was the original survival shield, the X1.
[01:32:14.840 --> 01:32:16.000]  And it worked pretty good.
[01:32:16.000 --> 01:32:19.880]  And then shortly thereafter you came out with that too, you know, with a deep burn source,
[01:32:19.880 --> 01:32:23.720]  you know, and I got really excited about that so I took it and man, in two weeks I went
[01:32:23.720 --> 01:32:29.680]  from brain fog to like literally like my brain was enlightened, you know, I could think again,
[01:32:29.680 --> 01:32:34.600]  I could connect with people again and over the course of the next couple of years I got
[01:32:34.600 --> 01:32:39.320]  my health back and I religiously took basically all of your supplements, they're all absolutely
[01:32:39.320 --> 01:32:40.320]  amazing supplements.
[01:32:40.320 --> 01:32:44.560]  The one I like recently is knockout literally like if you want to sleep just take it, it's
[01:32:44.560 --> 01:32:45.560]  amazing, it works.
[01:32:45.560 --> 01:32:49.680]  But anyway, so the point is we have to get ourselves clean, we have to break free of
[01:32:49.680 --> 01:32:53.840]  the globalist system and the only way to do that is to take our own health into our own
[01:32:53.840 --> 01:32:54.840]  hand.
[01:32:54.840 --> 01:32:55.840]  Beautifully said, brother.
[01:32:55.840 --> 01:33:01.560]  I thank you so much for your call and Godspeed.
[01:33:01.560 --> 01:33:08.200]  Leading up Frontal Assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:08.200 --> 01:33:34.360]  They want us to live in their clown world, suspend common sense and be their slaves but
[01:33:34.360 --> 01:33:36.000]  we're not going to do it.
[01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:41.280]  Look, I'm not going to get into this story a little bit next hour because it's about
[01:33:41.280 --> 01:33:44.360]  me but it's just about the system and all their lies.
[01:33:44.360 --> 01:33:49.160]  You remember they falsely said in that rigged court where the judge already said I was guilty
[01:33:49.160 --> 01:33:53.680]  five months ago in Texas and the whole Sandy Hook garbage that they had my whole phone
[01:33:53.680 --> 01:33:58.000]  for two years and it had January six stuff on it and they were referring it to law enforcement
[01:33:58.000 --> 01:34:00.160]  and I was caught all this crap.
[01:34:00.160 --> 01:34:03.560]  I gave all my cell phones to my lawyers did all the discovery.
[01:34:03.560 --> 01:34:08.080]  The judge said I gave no discovery and my lawyers even sent a raw text of six months
[01:34:08.080 --> 01:34:09.520]  off my phone.
[01:34:09.520 --> 01:34:12.240]  They dug through it all of course found nothing.
[01:34:12.240 --> 01:34:15.760]  I think they'll probably the media probably make something up at some point.
[01:34:15.760 --> 01:34:21.120]  They're so angry but they had Tucker Carlson text messages between he and I and I'm not
[01:34:21.120 --> 01:34:22.400]  going to get into Tucker Carlson.
[01:34:22.400 --> 01:34:26.320]  We've been friends for more than 10 years and we get dinner and stuff and we hang out
[01:34:26.320 --> 01:34:28.240]  and they were asking me all this stuff.
[01:34:28.240 --> 01:34:32.280]  I didn't answer their questions when the Huffington Post and a bunch of others called.
[01:34:32.280 --> 01:34:36.800]  I called one of the reporters up and made jokes and I said oh you caught me in the closet.
[01:34:36.800 --> 01:34:39.440]  You're like the hall monitor in sixth grade.
[01:34:39.440 --> 01:34:44.680]  You're you know on to me and I mean everybody knows Tucker Carlson's been on the show some
[01:34:44.680 --> 01:34:49.680]  everybody knows that and and and everybody knows he said that I was right about almost
[01:34:49.680 --> 01:34:51.520]  everything on air.
[01:34:51.520 --> 01:34:56.720]  But they act like they catch us in something and I thought the Huffington Post would be
[01:34:56.720 --> 01:34:57.720]  the first to break it.
[01:34:57.720 --> 01:35:03.040]  And the one's calling it that Rolling Stone has all my text messages from six months in
[01:35:03.040 --> 01:35:06.880]  the year 2019 into early 2020.
[01:35:06.880 --> 01:35:10.640]  Talk about stalking and the reporter I talked to yesterday kept saying I want Tucker to
[01:35:10.640 --> 01:35:12.640]  know that I'm reading his text.
[01:35:12.640 --> 01:35:17.280]  I want you to tell him that I'm going to do an article on him and he goes have you talked
[01:35:17.280 --> 01:35:18.280]  to Tucker.
[01:35:18.280 --> 01:35:19.280]  Have you talked to Tucker.
[01:35:19.280 --> 01:35:21.800]  And I said I'm not going to answer your question but I'll tell the listeners.
[01:35:21.800 --> 01:35:22.800]  Yeah I did.
[01:35:22.800 --> 01:35:24.800]  And Tucker said they can fuck off.
[01:35:24.800 --> 01:35:30.800]  Yeah there's this quote for your story but I respect my audience.
[01:35:30.800 --> 01:35:33.600]  So I'll tell my audience what Tucker said f off.
[01:35:33.600 --> 01:35:34.720]  I don't care.
[01:35:34.720 --> 01:35:36.560]  I'm proud to be your friend.
[01:35:36.560 --> 01:35:39.360]  There's your quote from Tucker when I talked to him yesterday morning.
[01:35:39.360 --> 01:35:47.680]  So it's just insane how they try to bully and intimidate and oh Alex Jones knows Tucker
[01:35:47.680 --> 01:35:49.200]  and Tucker's bad.
[01:35:49.200 --> 01:35:53.360]  Tucker Carlson's defended me more than 50 times on air and I appreciate him as he knows
[01:35:53.360 --> 01:35:57.200]  I'm telling the truth and I'm a good person and so is he and I love Tucker Carlson and
[01:35:57.200 --> 01:36:01.200]  I'm so glad that he dominates the news cycle.
[01:36:01.200 --> 01:36:05.720]  So I'll get to it later but look at this article they then admit oh it's six months of text
[01:36:05.720 --> 01:36:14.000]  messages the end of 2019 early 2020 and they say it's innocuous and there's nothing there.
[01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:18.960]  But it just shows how influential Jones is and how radical Tucker Carlson is and then
[01:36:18.960 --> 01:36:26.200]  they sit there like school girls and talk about our private messages and pour over them
[01:36:26.200 --> 01:36:31.040]  and they don't even know how to interpret them right it's early 2000 I'm saying it's
[01:36:31.040 --> 01:36:34.800]  a bio attack Trump at first thought it was nothing I said they're going to set him up
[01:36:34.800 --> 01:36:41.680]  if he doesn't at least respond he'll be sucker punched that's in there too so this is the
[01:36:41.680 --> 01:36:48.480]  level of garbage that these people engage in and that's exactly what it is it's total
[01:36:48.480 --> 01:36:57.680]  and complete garbage and it's ridiculous and boy if they knew who else I was talking to
[01:36:57.680 --> 01:37:04.760]  members of Congress foreign leaders big other big Fox post I mean I go out have dinner with
[01:37:04.760 --> 01:37:09.800]  them they all know I'm right they can't go all the way only Tucker is able for some reason
[01:37:09.800 --> 01:37:13.840]  to be able to get everything out and he is the freest and I'm not going to give you the
[01:37:13.840 --> 01:37:19.200]  inside baseball in it but let's just say this Tucker did not get paid what he could get
[01:37:19.200 --> 01:37:24.120]  paid to have total freedom and so he's done a lot to be able to tell the truth and I think
[01:37:24.120 --> 01:37:29.000]  Tucker's an icon I love him and it's it's it's great and I know how Tucker operates
[01:37:29.000 --> 01:37:38.360]  dummies your attempts to drive a wedge between Tucker and I and our families is going to
[01:37:38.360 --> 01:37:42.360]  do nothing but blow up in your faces so please I think I shouldn't be so honest with the
[01:37:42.360 --> 01:37:46.640]  enemy now let me do this instead I'll be sarcastic please stop reporting on me and her girls
[01:37:46.640 --> 01:37:50.960]  and please don't tell Tucker not to talk to me please don't tell Tucker not to defend
[01:37:50.960 --> 01:37:58.880]  me stop stop don't throw me in the briar patch do not leave me and Tucker alone stop it you're
[01:37:58.880 --> 01:38:09.200]  going to make him be mean to me oh no it's just don't they get it we don't care what
[01:38:09.200 --> 01:38:13.080]  you say we don't care what you do and in fact when you tell us not to do something we do
[01:38:13.080 --> 01:38:19.480]  it more I've already won let me give the left a little news flash and I'm not bragging
[01:38:19.480 --> 01:38:24.960]  I'll go to your calls I'm giving you a status report on how positive things are the viewers
[01:38:24.960 --> 01:38:30.400]  and listeners are anonymous you get to work as a doctor or a nurse or a school teacher
[01:38:30.400 --> 01:38:35.520]  or a police officer or a farmer or an auto mechanic or an 18-wheeler driver and or an
[01:38:35.520 --> 01:38:40.600]  artist or or a you get to be anonymous your wife knows you your husband knows your church
[01:38:40.600 --> 01:38:44.520]  knows your family but when you go to the store you're anonymous I'm not anonymous I'm known
[01:38:44.520 --> 01:38:50.720]  all over the world and let me tell you what happens for 15 20 years everywhere I go I
[01:38:50.720 --> 01:38:56.520]  shake hands and the positive responses were 95% let me tell you but but it would be only
[01:38:56.520 --> 01:39:01.960]  I was in a restaurant maybe one group would come over 15 20 years ago now I go to a restaurant
[01:39:01.960 --> 01:39:05.040]  I say listen can I be put in a private room not because I don't care about the public
[01:39:05.040 --> 01:39:07.800]  it's gonna make a major scene if they don't have a private room you know what happens
[01:39:07.800 --> 01:39:13.960]  my food gets bought almost every time and I get mobbed all around the table and I'm
[01:39:13.960 --> 01:39:18.240]  signing autographs for the waiters and the owner comes out and I get fallen into the
[01:39:18.240 --> 01:39:23.360]  parking lot and women are throwing themselves at me and I'm not bragging about it I'm just
[01:39:23.360 --> 01:39:27.560]  telling you when the establishment that's so hated came out and demonized me and lied
[01:39:27.560 --> 01:39:31.560]  about me and attacked me all this crap we've been put through it's been hard for my family
[01:39:31.560 --> 01:39:35.880]  it's been hard for me we do get haters we do get stalkers that 1% of the taxes is terrible
[01:39:35.880 --> 01:39:42.520]  it's not all been roses but they have made us way bigger and iconic out there and it's
[01:39:42.520 --> 01:39:51.080]  blown up in their face and now I will wear sunglasses and a ball cap if I'm gonna hike
[01:39:51.080 --> 01:39:55.800]  and I don't even talk to recognize my voice because I can't walk in the woods I could
[01:39:55.800 --> 01:40:00.400]  be in the woods nobody around me would say my kids fishing and people hear me 20 yards
[01:40:00.400 --> 01:40:05.640]  away and go oh it's Alex Jones so if you want to know how popular freedom is if you
[01:40:05.640 --> 01:40:10.160]  want to know how popular the awakening is I'm a litmus test I'm like a sensor in an
[01:40:10.160 --> 01:40:14.120]  engine to tell you how hot the engine is or how much gas is left in a tank I'm a sensor
[01:40:14.120 --> 01:40:18.800]  so because I'm a public figure I get to see the response and I'll be honest when Trump
[01:40:18.800 --> 01:40:26.760]  first got elected I went from 21 positive comments to 15 to 5 positive versus negative
[01:40:26.760 --> 01:40:31.080]  so for every 15 positive on the street I get 5 negative it was bad if I walk down the street

[01:48:33.960 --> 01:48:36.960]  Between the velvet lies
[01:48:36.960 --> 01:48:38.960]  There's a truth
[01:48:38.960 --> 01:48:42.960]  There's a truth that's hard to speak
[01:48:42.960 --> 01:48:44.960]  The vision never dies
[01:48:44.960 --> 01:48:47.960]  The vision never dies
[01:48:47.960 --> 01:48:49.960]  Alright, let's go to your phone call
[01:48:49.960 --> 01:48:52.960]  Lori in Washington, thanks for calling, welcome
[01:48:55.960 --> 01:48:56.960]  Hi, Alex
[01:48:56.960 --> 01:48:57.960]  Gonna talk to you
[01:48:57.960 --> 01:48:59.960]  I pray for you and your family
[01:48:59.960 --> 01:49:02.960]  I can't thank you enough for all of your great supplements
[01:49:02.960 --> 01:49:04.960]  And your information, you've saved my life
[01:49:04.960 --> 01:49:07.960]  Thank you, we love you, we're all working together
[01:49:07.960 --> 01:49:10.960]  I know, I wanted to ask you
[01:49:10.960 --> 01:49:13.960]  How do we hold these congresspeople that pass through
[01:49:13.960 --> 01:49:17.960]  This young globalist program at the World Economic Forum
[01:49:17.960 --> 01:49:20.960]  How do we get them to disavow that relationship?
[01:49:20.960 --> 01:49:22.960]  Well, you heard me with MTG
[01:49:22.960 --> 01:49:26.960]  It is illegal, it violates the Logan Act, a bunch of stuff
[01:49:26.960 --> 01:49:28.960]  We see the communist Chinese infiltrating
[01:49:28.960 --> 01:49:31.960]  Well, the Bilderberg group, the Deimos group that founded it
[01:49:31.960 --> 01:49:34.960]  Has infiltrated hundreds of governments and bragged they've done it
[01:49:34.960 --> 01:49:36.960]  And literally set policy
[01:49:36.960 --> 01:49:38.960]  And you can show how they set the policy
[01:49:38.960 --> 01:49:40.960]  And how the Democratic Party and the other parties
[01:49:40.960 --> 01:49:42.960]  Are the communists around the world
[01:49:42.960 --> 01:49:46.960]  From Brazil to New Zealand to Germany to France
[01:49:46.960 --> 01:49:48.960]  And all of them, hundreds of governments
[01:49:48.960 --> 01:49:50.960]  Kledge allegiance to the great reset and build back better
[01:49:50.960 --> 01:49:52.960]  You know, there's those videos where
[01:49:52.960 --> 01:49:55.960]  One leader say build back better and another one say build back better
[01:49:55.960 --> 01:49:57.960]  And another one says build back better till there's hundreds going
[01:49:57.960 --> 01:49:59.960]  Build back better, build back better, build back better, build back better
[01:49:59.960 --> 01:50:02.960]  Just like the Pfizer ads, they're all parroting the same thing
[01:50:02.960 --> 01:50:04.960]  And that's their agenda, that's their post-industrial world
[01:50:04.960 --> 01:50:07.960]  And I totally agree and we're so close
[01:50:07.960 --> 01:50:10.960]  There are massive investigations out there about big tech
[01:50:10.960 --> 01:50:14.960]  And intelligence agencies surveilling and censoring people on hundreds of issues
[01:50:14.960 --> 01:50:17.960]  That's really illegal, but who writes the talking points?
[01:50:17.960 --> 01:50:20.960]  The Deimos group three months ago was signed on
[01:50:20.960 --> 01:50:24.960]  As co-equal to the UN advising the UN on policy
[01:50:24.960 --> 01:50:27.960]  So an unelected group runs the UN
[01:50:27.960 --> 01:50:29.960]  Has penetrated more than half the cabinet
[01:50:29.960 --> 01:50:31.960]  And is trying to take global control
[01:50:31.960 --> 01:50:33.960]  And now they're meeting in Switzerland
[01:50:33.960 --> 01:50:35.960]  They're meeting coming up, Swiss Army
[01:50:35.960 --> 01:50:38.960]  Since 5,000 soldiers to guard Deimos global elite
[01:50:38.960 --> 01:50:40.960]  This is a governmental meeting
[01:50:40.960 --> 01:50:42.960]  With the head of NATO, Zelensky
[01:50:42.960 --> 01:50:45.960]  This is a governmental meeting in secret, it is criminal
[01:50:45.960 --> 01:50:48.960]  I agree
[01:50:48.960 --> 01:50:51.960]  Put pressure on Congress, call talk radio, get a buzz
[01:50:51.960 --> 01:50:54.960]  Talk at your church, expose people like Dan Crenshaw
[01:50:54.960 --> 01:50:57.960]  That are part of it, and people that have been part of it
[01:50:57.960 --> 01:50:59.960]  Like Tulsi, they only went to one meeting
[01:50:59.960 --> 01:51:01.960]  When she's young, they scoop her up, she's an up and comer
[01:51:01.960 --> 01:51:03.960]  She's decried it, she's come out against it
[01:51:03.960 --> 01:51:06.960]  We can forgive somebody that's been sucked in who comes out of it
[01:51:06.960 --> 01:51:09.960]  That's key, we gotta have an open door for folks that want to defect back
[01:51:09.960 --> 01:51:11.960]  To the good side, you understand?
[01:51:11.960 --> 01:51:13.960]  Exactly
[01:51:13.960 --> 01:51:15.960]  You gotta be forgiving, like Christ is
[01:51:15.960 --> 01:51:17.960]  Does that make sense?
[01:51:17.960 --> 01:51:19.960]  Absolutely, absolutely, thank you so much
[01:51:19.960 --> 01:51:21.960]  Thank you, I mean listen
[01:51:21.960 --> 01:51:23.960]  I don't say this because I'm proud of it
[01:51:23.960 --> 01:51:25.960]  I say it because it needs to be out there, I need to repent of it
[01:51:25.960 --> 01:51:28.960]  And I'm a sinner, and I'm not perfect, and Lord knows it
[01:51:28.960 --> 01:51:31.960]  I gotta control these things I shouldn't do just like last segment
[01:51:31.960 --> 01:51:33.960]  I never, very rarely cuss on here
[01:51:33.960 --> 01:51:35.960]  But that's what Tucker said, so I was repeating it
[01:51:35.960 --> 01:51:39.960]  The point is, is that
[01:51:39.960 --> 01:51:41.960]  I killed my children
[01:51:41.960 --> 01:51:43.960]  I didn't know they were humans, I believed in lies
[01:51:43.960 --> 01:51:45.960]  When I was a teenager, got girls pregnant
[01:51:45.960 --> 01:51:47.960]  And I repented of it, I had nightmares about it
[01:51:47.960 --> 01:51:49.960]  And I fought for life since then
[01:51:49.960 --> 01:51:51.960]  But I don't think of myself as some goody-to-shoe
[01:51:51.960 --> 01:51:53.960]  The letter always says, why does Jones admit that?
[01:51:53.960 --> 01:51:55.960]  Why would he do that? He makes you look bad
[01:51:55.960 --> 01:51:57.960]  No, no, it's the truth
[01:51:57.960 --> 01:51:59.960]  It's that I'm a bad person, but I want to be good
[01:51:59.960 --> 01:52:03.960]  And I'm asking Christ to purify me
[01:52:03.960 --> 01:52:05.960]  Sanctify me, and Christ has said
[01:52:05.960 --> 01:52:07.960]  Yes, I will forgive you
[01:52:07.960 --> 01:52:09.960]  Thank you, Daniel, you're on the air, thanks for holding
[01:52:09.960 --> 01:52:11.960]  Hey, Alex, how you doing, man?
[01:52:11.960 --> 01:52:13.960]  I'm alright, brother
[01:52:13.960 --> 01:52:15.960]  Yeah, I just like to pivot a little bit
[01:52:15.960 --> 01:52:18.960]  And talk about something that doesn't really get talked about too much
[01:52:18.960 --> 01:52:22.960]  So, like, five days ago, my sister overdosed on fentanyl
[01:52:22.960 --> 01:52:25.960]  And the hospital protocol
[01:52:25.960 --> 01:52:27.960]  I guess she came to
[01:52:27.960 --> 01:52:30.960]  And then when she got to the hospital, they intubated her
[01:52:30.960 --> 01:52:32.960]  Put her on a ventilator
[01:52:32.960 --> 01:52:35.960]  And put her back on fentanyl and propoval
[01:52:35.960 --> 01:52:38.960]  I was just wondering what your opinion or thoughts were
[01:52:38.960 --> 01:52:42.960]  Well, I mean, I'm not a
[01:52:42.960 --> 01:52:44.960]  Medical doctor who's an expert in that
[01:52:44.960 --> 01:52:46.960]  I mean, just, there's a whole school of medical
[01:52:46.960 --> 01:52:48.960]  Three-year program just to know how
[01:52:48.960 --> 01:52:50.960]  To be anesthesiologist, so I'm not going to
[01:52:50.960 --> 01:52:52.960]  Second guess what they did
[01:52:52.960 --> 01:52:54.960]  But a lot of people have bad reactions to fentanyl
[01:52:54.960 --> 01:52:56.960]  And they lay so many of the vape pens
[01:52:56.960 --> 01:52:58.960]  That are on the street with it in marijuana and stuff
[01:52:58.960 --> 01:52:59.960]  It's lying
[01:52:59.960 --> 01:53:01.960]  I tell my children, listen
[01:53:01.960 --> 01:53:03.960]  When I was growing up, my parents said, drugs are bad
[01:53:03.960 --> 01:53:05.960]  But if you're going to experiment, do it with friends
[01:53:05.960 --> 01:53:06.960]  And you'll find out
[01:53:06.960 --> 01:53:08.960]  And every drug I did, I hated it
[01:53:08.960 --> 01:53:09.960]  I mean, I had met a few times, hated it
[01:53:09.960 --> 01:53:10.960]  The cocaine a few times, hated it
[01:53:10.960 --> 01:53:12.960]  The tobacco and alcohol loved it
[01:53:12.960 --> 01:53:14.960]  And caffeine, those are my things
[01:53:14.960 --> 01:53:18.960]  But sitting there looking at that
[01:53:18.960 --> 01:53:19.960]  It's just horrible
[01:53:19.960 --> 01:53:24.960]  And we have over 130,000 deaths last year from fentanyl
[01:53:24.960 --> 01:53:25.960]  They're shipping it in
[01:53:25.960 --> 01:53:26.960]  Nothing's being done about it
[01:53:26.960 --> 01:53:27.960]  I think there should be a death penalty
[01:53:27.960 --> 01:53:30.960]  For fentanyl dealers that knowingly put it on the street
[01:53:30.960 --> 01:53:32.960]  Because even babies will be at a playground
[01:53:32.960 --> 01:53:34.960]  And put a little piece of it in their mouth
[01:53:34.960 --> 01:53:36.960]  It'll kill them or put them in a coma
[01:53:36.960 --> 01:53:37.960]  And the people doing this
[01:53:37.960 --> 01:53:40.960]  Are putting a chemical weapon on the streets
[01:53:40.960 --> 01:53:43.960]  And it's 100 times stronger than opium
[01:53:43.960 --> 01:53:45.960]  It's about, what is it, like 20 times stronger
[01:53:45.960 --> 01:53:47.960]  Than heroin depending on the type of fentanyl
[01:53:47.960 --> 01:53:50.960]  And it is just weaponized by anything you can imagine
[01:53:50.960 --> 01:53:52.960]  And you've got to wear a respirator to be around it
[01:53:52.960 --> 01:53:53.960]  I feel sorry for the cops
[01:53:53.960 --> 01:53:54.960]  Some people are going to be around it
[01:53:54.960 --> 01:53:55.960]  And cleaning out the streets
[01:53:55.960 --> 01:53:56.960]  As cops get killed all the time
[01:53:56.960 --> 01:53:57.960]  Just busted people with it
[01:53:57.960 --> 01:53:59.960]  And they just touch their mouth with their eye
[01:53:59.960 --> 01:54:01.960]  And you're dead in 10 minutes
[01:54:01.960 --> 01:54:05.960]  So, I mean, I hope your family gets better
[01:54:05.960 --> 01:54:06.960]  I hope she gets better
[01:54:06.960 --> 01:54:08.960]  But I really can't give advice
[01:54:08.960 --> 01:54:09.960]  Or diagnose something from afar
[01:54:09.960 --> 01:54:10.960]  When I'm not even a doctor
[01:54:10.960 --> 01:54:11.960]  I just study the facts
[01:54:11.960 --> 01:54:13.960]  But I have real fears about that
[01:54:13.960 --> 01:54:14.960]  I have fears about conurex
[01:54:14.960 --> 01:54:16.960]  Because that's the number one cause of death
[01:54:16.960 --> 01:54:17.960]  Under 50 for my children
[01:54:17.960 --> 01:54:19.960]  And I have fears of fentanyl
[01:54:19.960 --> 01:54:20.960]  Because the damn stuff's everywhere
[01:54:20.960 --> 01:54:22.960]  And I know so many people have been killed by it
[01:54:22.960 --> 01:54:24.960]  What do you think?
[01:54:24.960 --> 01:54:25.960]  Yeah, I agree
[01:54:25.960 --> 01:54:28.960]  It's just, I'm just curious
[01:54:28.960 --> 01:54:31.960]  She's been on a ventilator for five days now
[01:54:31.960 --> 01:54:33.960]  There's really no plan
[01:54:33.960 --> 01:54:34.960]  They don't have a plan really
[01:54:34.960 --> 01:54:35.960]  They're kind of just winging it
[01:54:35.960 --> 01:54:37.960]  And then I talked to another girl who said
[01:54:37.960 --> 01:54:39.960]  She had a similar experience when her mom passed away
[01:54:39.960 --> 01:54:41.960]  And they were trying to file a lawsuit
[01:54:41.960 --> 01:54:42.960]  Against John Randolph
[01:54:42.960 --> 01:54:44.960]  What we know is they're using ventilators
[01:54:44.960 --> 01:54:46.960]  To kill people with these new protocols
[01:54:46.960 --> 01:54:50.960]  So, did she stop breathing completely?
[01:54:50.960 --> 01:54:53.960]  Or why are they saying she's on a ventilator?
[01:54:53.960 --> 01:54:55.960]  Well, that's what I'm trying to figure out
[01:54:55.960 --> 01:54:57.960]  The chain of events I led up to
[01:54:57.960 --> 01:54:59.960]  Because apparently she came too
[01:54:59.960 --> 01:55:01.960]  And they said she was in an altered state of consciousness
[01:55:01.960 --> 01:55:03.960]  So then they basically just put her back
[01:55:03.960 --> 01:55:05.960]  On fentanyl and propoval
[01:55:05.960 --> 01:55:07.960]  And just kind of just left her
[01:55:07.960 --> 01:55:09.960]  So, I mean, I don't know
[01:55:09.960 --> 01:55:10.960]  I'm still trying to figure out how to
[01:55:10.960 --> 01:55:11.960]  She's in a medically induced coma
[01:55:11.960 --> 01:55:13.960]  Well, that doesn't sound good to me, buddy
[01:55:13.960 --> 01:55:14.960]  I would get up there
[01:55:14.960 --> 01:55:15.960]  I would start speaking out
[01:55:15.960 --> 01:55:16.960]  I'd bullhorn the hospital
[01:55:16.960 --> 01:55:17.960]  They don't listen to you
[01:55:17.960 --> 01:55:19.960]  You know, from the edge of the street
[01:55:19.960 --> 01:55:20.960]  I'd call the news media
[01:55:20.960 --> 01:55:23.960]  And let them know they're being watched, brother
[01:55:23.960 --> 01:55:24.960]  Let me do this
[01:55:24.960 --> 01:55:25.960]  Give me your name and number
[01:55:25.960 --> 01:55:27.960]  And I want to tell the crew
[01:55:27.960 --> 01:55:28.960]  I want to call you back
[01:55:28.960 --> 01:55:30.960]  I'm going to do a special Saturday show
[01:55:30.960 --> 01:55:31.960]  It's a special guest
[01:55:31.960 --> 01:55:33.960]  Guys, don't let me forget this, please
[01:55:33.960 --> 01:55:34.960]  This guy's counting on us
[01:55:34.960 --> 01:55:36.960]  I want an update on your family member
[01:55:36.960 --> 01:55:40.960]  And we will call you back on Saturday, okay?
[01:55:40.960 --> 01:55:41.960]  Okay, thank you so much, Alex
[01:55:41.960 --> 01:55:42.960]  God bless you
[01:55:42.960 --> 01:55:43.960]  Where is this exactly?
[01:55:43.960 --> 01:55:45.960]  Where is this happening?
[01:55:45.960 --> 01:55:46.960]  Oh, this is in Virginia
[01:55:46.960 --> 01:55:48.960]  Like 30 minutes south of Richmond
[01:55:48.960 --> 01:55:50.960]  Do you know how she got the fentanyl?
[01:55:50.960 --> 01:55:52.960]  Or did she knowingly took it or was it laced?
[01:55:52.960 --> 01:55:54.960]  She was a drug user
[01:55:54.960 --> 01:55:55.960]  And meth and fentanyl
[01:55:55.960 --> 01:55:56.960]  But I mean, she's an adult
[01:55:56.960 --> 01:55:57.960]  She made her own decisions
[01:55:57.960 --> 01:56:01.960]  But, I mean, previous experiences
[01:56:01.960 --> 01:56:02.960]  With people overdose
[01:56:02.960 --> 01:56:03.960]  And they kind of come through
[01:56:03.960 --> 01:56:04.960]  After they get Narcan
[01:56:04.960 --> 01:56:06.960]  And then they're kind of like
[01:56:06.960 --> 01:56:07.960]  On their way back to the street
[01:56:07.960 --> 01:56:10.960]  You know, so I don't know if it's
[01:56:10.960 --> 01:56:11.960]  Because you never like
[01:56:11.960 --> 01:56:13.960]  We've had whistleblower nurses on
[01:56:13.960 --> 01:56:14.960]  From New York
[01:56:14.960 --> 01:56:16.960]  Where they would get a homeless person
[01:56:16.960 --> 01:56:17.960]  And even have COVID
[01:56:17.960 --> 01:56:19.960]  They'd be COVID negative
[01:56:19.960 --> 01:56:20.960]  They'd still put them on a ventilator
[01:56:20.960 --> 01:56:21.960]  Because they had no friends
[01:56:21.960 --> 01:56:23.960]  Then they'd get the $53,000
[01:56:23.960 --> 01:56:25.960]  Or $51,000 to kill them
[01:56:25.960 --> 01:56:26.960]  So I know in that case
[01:56:26.960 --> 01:56:27.960]  They were murdering people
[01:56:27.960 --> 01:56:28.960]  In key Democrat states
[01:56:28.960 --> 01:56:29.960]  I hope that's not happening
[01:56:29.960 --> 01:56:30.960]  In Virginia, brother
[01:56:30.960 --> 01:56:31.960]  God bless you
[01:56:31.960 --> 01:56:32.960]  Give us your name and number
[01:56:32.960 --> 01:56:33.960]  If you want, we'll call you back
[01:56:33.960 --> 01:56:34.960]  On Saturday and check on the situation
[01:56:34.960 --> 01:56:35.960]  And if things are going bad
[01:56:35.960 --> 01:56:36.960]  You can name the hospital
[01:56:36.960 --> 01:56:39.960]  You can talk about it, okay?
[01:56:39.960 --> 01:56:41.960]  Thank you, brother
[01:56:41.960 --> 01:56:43.960]  All right, we got Carlos and Sage
[01:56:43.960 --> 01:56:44.960]  And Steve and Todd and Caroline
[01:56:44.960 --> 01:56:46.960]  And Al and Evan and everybody
[01:56:46.960 --> 01:56:47.960]  And we're going to get to
[01:56:47.960 --> 01:56:48.960]  A lot of you coming up
[01:56:48.960 --> 01:56:50.960]  We have a special guest in studio
[01:56:50.960 --> 01:56:51.960]  And then in an hour
[01:56:51.960 --> 01:56:53.960]  I'm on Pierce Morgan's live show
[01:56:53.960 --> 01:56:54.960]  In the U.K. and it goes out over the U.S.
[01:56:54.960 --> 01:56:56.960]  And he shows pretty big usually
[01:56:56.960 --> 01:56:58.960]  But when he has a big guest on
[01:56:58.960 --> 01:57:00.960]  Like a Kanye West
[01:57:00.960 --> 01:57:01.960]  Or a Yay West
[01:57:01.960 --> 01:57:03.960]  Or a Andrew Tate
[01:57:03.960 --> 01:57:04.960]  Or any of those kind of people
[01:57:04.960 --> 01:57:05.960]  That gets tens of millions of views
[01:57:05.960 --> 01:57:06.960]  So I think this is going to be
[01:57:06.960 --> 01:57:07.960]  A big interview
[01:57:07.960 --> 01:57:08.960]  We'll be able to talk about a lot of stuff
[01:57:08.960 --> 01:57:09.960]  Could be fiery
[01:57:09.960 --> 01:57:10.960]  I'm going to try to be friendly
[01:57:10.960 --> 01:57:11.960]  And it's actually going to be nice
[01:57:11.960 --> 01:57:12.960]  But if he's not nice
[01:57:12.960 --> 01:57:13.960]  I'll do what I did ten years ago
[01:57:13.960 --> 01:57:15.960]  And I'll mop the floor with him
[01:57:15.960 --> 01:57:17.960]  Speaking of Andrew Tate
[01:57:17.960 --> 01:57:18.960]  In the New York Post
[01:57:18.960 --> 01:57:19.960]  Two of the six women
[01:57:19.960 --> 01:57:20.960]  Contacted by the media
[01:57:20.960 --> 01:57:21.960]  That say he raped them
[01:57:21.960 --> 01:57:22.960]  And all they say
[01:57:22.960 --> 01:57:23.960]  None of it's true
[01:57:23.960 --> 01:57:24.960]  It's all lies
[01:57:24.960 --> 01:57:25.960]  And they're saying
[01:57:25.960 --> 01:57:26.960]  They know some of the other women
[01:57:26.960 --> 01:57:27.960]  And that's not true either
[01:57:27.960 --> 01:57:28.960]  See
[01:57:28.960 --> 01:57:30.960]  So Andrew Tate accusers
[01:57:30.960 --> 01:57:31.960]  Claim they made clear
[01:57:31.960 --> 01:57:33.960]  They're not victims
[01:57:33.960 --> 01:57:34.960]  And they said they're being
[01:57:34.960 --> 01:57:35.960]  Listed as victims
[01:57:35.960 --> 01:57:36.960]  And it's not true
[01:57:36.960 --> 01:57:37.960]  See
[01:57:37.960 --> 01:57:38.960]  I mean
[01:57:38.960 --> 01:57:39.960]  He could be guilty
[01:57:39.960 --> 01:57:40.960]  I don't think he is
[01:57:40.960 --> 01:57:41.960]  This thing stinks to high heaven
[01:57:41.960 --> 01:57:42.960]  And this is a big piece
[01:57:42.960 --> 01:57:43.960]  Going towards that
[01:57:43.960 --> 01:57:44.960]  So pray for Andrew Tate
[01:57:44.960 --> 01:57:50.960]  Mark Twain, one of America's greatest
[01:57:50.960 --> 01:57:53.960]  Writers and satirists in Mies
[01:57:53.960 --> 01:57:56.960]  Famously said more than 150 years ago
[01:57:56.960 --> 01:57:58.960]  Rumors of his demise
[01:57:58.960 --> 01:58:00.960]  Had been greatly exaggerated
[01:58:00.960 --> 01:58:01.960]  Because the newspapers kept saying
[01:58:01.960 --> 01:58:04.960]  He died decades before he did die
[01:58:04.960 --> 01:58:06.960]  And it's the same PSYOP today
[01:58:06.960 --> 01:58:08.960]  Info Wars is more influential
[01:58:08.960 --> 01:58:09.960]  And more powerful than ever
[01:58:09.960 --> 01:58:10.960]  Because of your support
[01:58:10.960 --> 01:58:11.960]  And because of the facts
[01:58:11.960 --> 01:58:14.960]  Of what we've covered is coming true
[01:58:14.960 --> 01:58:15.960]  But if they can convince you
[01:58:15.960 --> 01:58:16.960]  We've been shut down
[01:58:16.960 --> 01:58:17.960]  If they can convince you
[01:58:17.960 --> 01:58:19.960]  That we're going away
[01:58:19.960 --> 01:58:20.960]  And you stop supporting
[01:58:20.960 --> 01:58:21.960]  You stop spreading the word
[01:58:21.960 --> 01:58:23.960]  Then they do win
[01:58:23.960 --> 01:58:24.960]  Ladies and gentlemen
[01:58:24.960 --> 01:58:26.960]  There's only one group of people
[01:58:26.960 --> 01:58:27.960]  That can shut down Info Wars
[01:58:27.960 --> 01:58:29.960]  And that's you the viewers and listeners
[01:58:29.960 --> 01:58:30.960]  If you decide we're done
[01:58:30.960 --> 01:58:31.960]  We're done
[01:58:31.960 --> 01:58:32.960]  If you decide to go to

[01:59:46.960 --> 01:59:48.960]  InfoWars.com
[01:59:49.960 --> 01:59:51.960]  Leading a frontal assault
[01:59:51.960 --> 01:59:54.960]  On the lies of the New World Order
[01:59:54.960 --> 01:59:56.960]  It's Alex Jones
[01:59:58.960 --> 02:00:01.960]  Humanity is in a very dangerous position right now
[02:00:01.960 --> 02:00:04.960]  Powerful corporations using military-grade
[02:00:04.960 --> 02:00:06.960]  Psychological warfare programs
[02:00:06.960 --> 02:00:08.960]  Are rolling out a biomedical tyranny
[02:00:08.960 --> 02:00:09.960]  Worldwide
[02:00:09.960 --> 02:00:10.960]  At World ID
[02:00:10.960 --> 02:00:12.960]  A casteless society
[02:00:12.960 --> 02:00:13.960]  A social credit score
[02:00:13.960 --> 02:00:15.960]  A universal basic income
[02:00:15.960 --> 02:00:17.960]  Where every facet of your life
[02:00:17.960 --> 02:00:19.960]  Is tracked, surveilled, and controlled
[02:00:19.960 --> 02:00:21.960]  If you think the censorship
[02:00:21.960 --> 02:00:23.960]  And the surveillance you've seen
[02:00:23.960 --> 02:00:24.960]  So far by the deep state
[02:00:24.960 --> 02:00:26.960]  And big tech was bad
[02:00:26.960 --> 02:00:28.960]  That is just the opening salvo
[02:00:28.960 --> 02:00:30.960]  Of their attack
[02:00:30.960 --> 02:00:32.960]  Humanity and all of our hard fought
[02:00:32.960 --> 02:00:33.960]  Liberties and freedoms
[02:00:33.960 --> 02:00:34.960]  And all of our safeguards
[02:00:34.960 --> 02:00:36.960]  Are literally on the edge
[02:00:36.960 --> 02:00:38.960]  Of a cliff
[02:00:38.960 --> 02:00:40.960]  But without InfoWars
[02:00:40.960 --> 02:00:41.960]  On the air
[02:00:41.960 --> 02:00:44.960]  The general public is not going to be aware
[02:00:44.960 --> 02:00:45.960]  Of the enemy operations
[02:00:45.960 --> 02:00:47.960]  We didn't just tell you about
[02:00:47.960 --> 02:00:49.960]  This whole poison shot rollout
[02:00:49.960 --> 02:00:51.960]  First three years ago on record
[02:00:51.960 --> 02:00:53.960]  We're also telling you what's coming next
[02:00:53.960 --> 02:00:55.960]  We track the enemy
[02:00:55.960 --> 02:00:57.960]  They're preparing new bioweapon releases
[02:00:57.960 --> 02:01:00.960]  And new poison mRNA franken shots
[02:01:00.960 --> 02:01:02.960]  Ladies and gentlemen
[02:01:02.960 --> 02:01:03.960]  My family, your family
[02:01:03.960 --> 02:01:05.960]  Is at the edge of a cliff
[02:01:05.960 --> 02:01:07.960]  Bill Gates, Klaus Schwab
[02:01:07.960 --> 02:01:09.960]  The UN, the WHO
[02:01:09.960 --> 02:01:11.960]  Is literally pushing us over
[02:01:11.960 --> 02:01:13.960]  Into that casual society hell grid
[02:01:13.960 --> 02:01:15.960]  Into that biomedical tyranny
[02:01:15.960 --> 02:01:16.960]  That will be even worse
[02:01:16.960 --> 02:01:17.960]  Than what you see in communist China
[02:01:17.960 --> 02:01:19.960]  That is the current main laboratory
[02:01:19.960 --> 02:01:20.960]  Of this control
[02:01:20.960 --> 02:01:21.960]  We have to first recognize
[02:01:21.960 --> 02:01:22.960]  There is a cliff
[02:01:22.960 --> 02:01:24.960]  We have to recognize that millions of people
[02:01:24.960 --> 02:01:26.960]  Have been forced into these deadly shots
[02:01:26.960 --> 02:01:27.960]  And pushed over the cliff and died
[02:01:27.960 --> 02:01:29.960]  Tens of millions more are sick
[02:01:29.960 --> 02:01:32.960]  And dying from these poison shots
[02:01:32.960 --> 02:01:33.960]  Every one of you watching
[02:01:33.960 --> 02:01:35.960]  Know someone who took the shot and died
[02:01:35.960 --> 02:01:37.960]  Or who became deathly ill
[02:01:37.960 --> 02:01:39.960]  In their own documents show
[02:01:39.960 --> 02:01:40.960]  They know this is deadly
[02:01:40.960 --> 02:01:41.960]  And what do they do
[02:01:41.960 --> 02:01:42.960]  They push and push and push
[02:01:42.960 --> 02:01:44.960]  And say, well, it's up to you
[02:01:44.960 --> 02:01:45.960]  But we'll take your rights and freedoms away
[02:01:45.960 --> 02:01:46.960]  If you don't take it
[02:01:46.960 --> 02:01:48.960]  Stand up to the tyrants
[02:01:48.960 --> 02:01:49.960]  And think they own your body
[02:01:49.960 --> 02:01:50.960]  But they own my body
[02:01:50.960 --> 02:01:51.960]  And spread the word
[02:01:51.960 --> 02:01:53.960]  And share the articles and the videos
[02:01:53.960 --> 02:01:54.960]  Like your life depends on it
[02:01:54.960 --> 02:01:55.960]  From infoawards.com
[02:01:55.960 --> 02:02:15.960]  Because it does
[02:02:15.960 --> 02:02:25.960]  The same sigh
[02:02:25.960 --> 02:02:26.960]  But if they can convince you
[02:02:26.960 --> 02:02:27.960]  We've been shut down
[02:02:27.960 --> 02:02:28.960]  If they can convince you
[02:02:28.960 --> 02:02:29.960]  That we're going away
[02:02:29.960 --> 02:02:31.960]  And you stop supporting
[02:02:31.960 --> 02:02:32.960]  You stop spreading the word
[02:02:32.960 --> 02:02:33.960]  Then they do win
[02:02:33.960 --> 02:02:34.960]  Ladies and gentlemen
[02:02:34.960 --> 02:02:36.960]  There's only one group of people
[02:02:36.960 --> 02:02:38.960]  That can shut down infoawards
[02:02:38.960 --> 02:02:40.960]  And that's you, the viewers and listeners
[02:02:40.960 --> 02:02:41.960]  If you decide we're done, we're done
[02:02:41.960 --> 02:02:43.960]  If you decide to go to infoawards.com
[02:02:43.960 --> 02:02:44.960]  Against supplements and books
[02:02:44.960 --> 02:02:46.960]  And films and t-shirts and so much more
[02:02:46.960 --> 02:02:48.960]  We will stay on the air indefinitely
[02:02:48.960 --> 02:02:50.960]  It is all in your hands
[02:02:50.960 --> 02:02:51.960]  So thanks for your support
[02:02:51.960 --> 02:02:52.960]  Stand up against the globalists
[02:02:52.960 --> 02:02:54.960]  Go to infoawards.com right now
[02:02:54.960 --> 02:02:55.960]  And keep us on air
[02:02:55.960 --> 02:03:23.960]  It's up to you
[02:03:23.960 --> 02:03:25.960]  The views seem to have become that
[02:03:25.960 --> 02:03:26.960]  If you can't beat them,
[02:03:26.960 --> 02:03:27.960]  Prevents them from speaking
[02:03:27.960 --> 02:03:29.960]  So far the most prominent casualty
[02:03:29.960 --> 02:03:30.960]  Of the crusade against free expression
[02:03:30.960 --> 02:03:32.960]  Has been the radio show host Alex Jones
[02:03:32.960 --> 02:03:34.960]  There is a concerted effort
[02:03:34.960 --> 02:03:35.960]  By the Democratic Party
[02:03:35.960 --> 02:03:37.960]  And multinational corporations in Big Tech
[02:03:37.960 --> 02:03:39.960]  To silence conservative and nationalist
[02:03:39.960 --> 02:03:40.960]  And populist voices
[02:03:40.960 --> 02:03:42.960]  There's also guys on CNN
[02:03:42.960 --> 02:03:43.960]  That spend their whole day
[02:03:43.960 --> 02:03:44.960]  Calling Facebook
[02:03:44.960 --> 02:03:46.960]  And saying can you ban this person
[02:03:46.960 --> 02:03:48.960]  He may be America's best known
[02:03:48.960 --> 02:03:49.960]  Conspiracy theorist
[02:03:49.960 --> 02:03:51.960]  But this week, Alex Jones' content
[02:03:51.960 --> 02:03:53.960]  Will be a little harder to find
[02:03:53.960 --> 02:03:55.960]  Shame on the mainstream corporate media
[02:03:55.960 --> 02:03:57.960]  For not defending the First Amendment
[02:03:57.960 --> 02:03:58.960]  But instead attack dogging
[02:03:58.960 --> 02:04:00.960]  Calling for federal regulators
[02:04:00.960 --> 02:04:02.960]  To shut down independent, free press
[02:04:02.960 --> 02:04:03.960]  Working with Big Tech
[02:04:03.960 --> 02:04:05.960]  People know what's true
[02:04:05.960 --> 02:04:06.960]  They can smell it
[02:04:06.960 --> 02:04:07.960]  Info wars
[02:04:07.960 --> 02:04:11.960]  The most banned network in the world
[02:04:11.960 --> 02:04:14.960]  In a free country, everyone can be heard
[02:04:14.960 --> 02:04:15.960]  Into talitarian societies
[02:04:15.960 --> 02:04:22.960]  Only the powerful can be heard
[02:04:45.960 --> 02:05:01.960]  Ladies and gentlemen, a very exciting development
[02:05:01.960 --> 02:05:02.960]  That has just taken place
[02:05:02.960 --> 02:05:04.960]  I want to encourage you all to go to
[02:05:04.960 --> 02:05:05.960]  infowarscore.com
[02:05:05.960 --> 02:05:07.960]  And check it out for yourself
[02:05:07.960 --> 02:05:11.960]  Because it is a very strong, high quality formula
[02:05:11.960 --> 02:05:13.960]  Down and out sleep support, liquid
[02:05:13.960 --> 02:05:15.960]  Is very fast acting
[02:05:15.960 --> 02:05:16.960]  Taking out of the tongue
[02:05:16.960 --> 02:05:19.960]  It's got a very good dose of melatonin
[02:05:19.960 --> 02:05:22.960]  Passion flower, valerian root extract
[02:05:22.960 --> 02:05:24.960]  Lemon balm and German chamomile
[02:05:24.960 --> 02:05:27.960]  All of these compounds are documented on record
[02:05:27.960 --> 02:05:31.960]  To help give you deeper, cleaner, healthier sleep
[02:05:31.960 --> 02:05:33.960]  And that is one of the biggest game changers out there
[02:05:33.960 --> 02:05:35.960]  With all the stress we have in this world
[02:05:35.960 --> 02:05:37.960]  And we've got some other great sleep eggs as well
[02:05:37.960 --> 02:05:38.960]  And they're excellent
[02:05:38.960 --> 02:05:39.960]  They're all different formulas
[02:05:39.960 --> 02:05:41.960]  But this one is particularly
[02:05:41.960 --> 02:05:44.960]  The strongest one we have
[02:05:44.960 --> 02:05:45.960]  So down and out
[02:05:45.960 --> 02:05:47.960]  It's sold out for more than five months
[02:05:47.960 --> 02:05:49.960]  It's now back available at infowarscore.com
[02:05:49.960 --> 02:05:52.960]  So get better, deeper rest
[02:05:52.960 --> 02:05:53.960]  Push your immune system
[02:05:53.960 --> 02:05:55.960]  And support the info war
[02:05:55.960 --> 02:06:13.960]  The answer to 1984 is 1776
[02:06:13.960 --> 02:06:14.960]  Live from Austin, Texas
[02:06:14.960 --> 02:06:15.960]  Broadcasting worldwide
[02:06:15.960 --> 02:06:16.960]  It's Alex Jones
[02:06:16.960 --> 02:06:18.960]  Well, I met him at the American tour
[02:06:18.960 --> 02:06:19.960]  Was already fully aware of his work
[02:06:19.960 --> 02:06:22.960]  Got a huge response when I was on his show
[02:06:22.960 --> 02:06:24.960]  He's Pastor Dave Scarlett
[02:06:24.960 --> 02:06:26.960]  He's moved to Texas from Ohio
[02:06:26.960 --> 02:06:29.960]  And he has his glory.me
[02:06:29.960 --> 02:06:32.960]  And it reaches over 25 million people
[02:06:32.960 --> 02:06:35.960]  Every single week, conservatively
[02:06:35.960 --> 02:06:37.960]  The pastors of this nation
[02:06:37.960 --> 02:06:38.960]  I'm very critical
[02:06:38.960 --> 02:06:39.960]  A lot of the mainline churches
[02:06:39.960 --> 02:06:41.960]  Not exposing the New World Order
[02:06:41.960 --> 02:06:42.960]  But I gotta say more and more they are
[02:06:42.960 --> 02:06:43.960]  But this guy's hardcore
[02:06:43.960 --> 02:06:45.960]  But even mainline big mega churches
[02:06:45.960 --> 02:06:46.960]  I've gone to
[02:06:46.960 --> 02:06:48.960]  I went to church a lot with Jesse James
[02:06:48.960 --> 02:06:49.960]  Here at some of the big churches
[02:06:49.960 --> 02:06:50.960]  And some of the others
[02:06:50.960 --> 02:06:51.960]  And I go in now
[02:06:51.960 --> 02:06:53.960]  To those churches I went to years ago
[02:06:53.960 --> 02:06:54.960]  And they weren't talking about these issues
[02:06:54.960 --> 02:06:56.960]  They're talking about the great reset
[02:06:56.960 --> 02:06:57.960]  And the anti-crimes
[02:06:57.960 --> 02:06:58.960]  And the castle of society
[02:06:58.960 --> 02:06:59.960]  And all of it now
[02:06:59.960 --> 02:07:00.960]  So it seems to me
[02:07:00.960 --> 02:07:01.960]  There's a revival
[02:07:01.960 --> 02:07:02.960]  Not just a Christ in the Bible
[02:07:02.960 --> 02:07:05.960]  But what the revelations warns us of
[02:07:05.960 --> 02:07:06.960]  And people really get to
[02:07:06.960 --> 02:07:07.960]  So Pastor Dave Scarlett
[02:07:07.960 --> 02:07:09.960]  Really appreciate you being here with us today
[02:07:09.960 --> 02:07:10.960]  When I invite you back any time
[02:07:10.960 --> 02:07:12.960]  I know you coast a lot with
[02:07:12.960 --> 02:07:13.960]  A general friend
[02:07:13.960 --> 02:07:14.960]  We love him
[02:07:14.960 --> 02:07:15.960]  We appreciate him
[02:07:15.960 --> 02:07:17.960]  You went and stayed in a tent
[02:07:17.960 --> 02:07:18.960]  I guess down on the border
[02:07:18.960 --> 02:07:19.960]  Shot some incredible footage
[02:07:19.960 --> 02:07:20.960]  Wherever you want to go
[02:07:20.960 --> 02:07:22.960]  This we've got some amazing B-roll
[02:07:22.960 --> 02:07:24.960]  Just you're a smart guy
[02:07:24.960 --> 02:07:26.960]  What is your view on the state of the world
[02:07:26.960 --> 02:07:28.960]  The state of the fight against evil
[02:07:28.960 --> 02:07:29.960]  It seems to me
[02:07:29.960 --> 02:07:30.960]  There is breakthroughs
[02:07:30.960 --> 02:07:31.960]  With criminal investigations
[02:07:31.960 --> 02:07:32.960]  And the shots
[02:07:32.960 --> 02:07:33.960]  And people waking up on so many fronts
[02:07:33.960 --> 02:07:35.960]  But the devil's just pulling out all the stops
[02:07:35.960 --> 02:07:38.960]  If you were, say, you know, mad
[02:07:38.960 --> 02:07:39.960]  In a football commentator
[02:07:39.960 --> 02:07:40.960]  Here at the Super Bowl
[02:07:40.960 --> 02:07:41.960]  How would you describe
[02:07:41.960 --> 02:07:42.960]  The current place we're at?
[02:07:42.960 --> 02:07:44.960]  I would say it's fourth dawn
[02:07:44.960 --> 02:07:46.960]  And one from the one
[02:07:46.960 --> 02:07:48.960]  And there's no one second on the clock
[02:07:48.960 --> 02:07:49.960]  There's no time left
[02:07:49.960 --> 02:07:51.960]  We need to be all in
[02:07:51.960 --> 02:07:52.960]  To get this country back
[02:07:52.960 --> 02:07:54.960]  In the name of Jesus Christ
[02:07:54.960 --> 02:07:56.960]  And get this eagle nation back
[02:07:56.960 --> 02:07:59.960]  We're on the precipice of losing it for good
[02:07:59.960 --> 02:08:01.960]  And that's why we have to be all in
[02:08:01.960 --> 02:08:02.960]  And take action
[02:08:02.960 --> 02:08:04.960]  God-family country
[02:08:04.960 --> 02:08:06.960]  Absolutely
[02:08:06.960 --> 02:08:07.960]  You've got the floor
[02:08:07.960 --> 02:08:08.960]  Because I'll talk forever
[02:08:08.960 --> 02:08:09.960]  I've been on your show
[02:08:09.960 --> 02:08:11.960]  Amazing things you do
[02:08:11.960 --> 02:08:13.960]  What are the most important issues
[02:08:13.960 --> 02:08:14.960]  For you right now?
[02:08:14.960 --> 02:08:16.960]  Well, it's getting people to realize
[02:08:16.960 --> 02:08:18.960]  How important these times are
[02:08:18.960 --> 02:08:19.960]  And I tell people today
[02:08:19.960 --> 02:08:21.960]  This is the greatest time in the history of the world
[02:08:21.960 --> 02:08:22.960]  To be alive
[02:08:22.960 --> 02:08:23.960]  But you have to take action
[02:08:23.960 --> 02:08:24.960]  If you're going to sit back
[02:08:24.960 --> 02:08:25.960]  And be on the fence
[02:08:25.960 --> 02:08:26.960]  You're going to be out
[02:08:26.960 --> 02:08:27.960]  If you're in the front line
[02:08:27.960 --> 02:08:28.960]  In the fight
[02:08:28.960 --> 02:08:29.960]  And that's what we need to do
[02:08:29.960 --> 02:08:30.960]  To get this country back
[02:08:30.960 --> 02:08:31.960]  Is fight
[02:08:31.960 --> 02:08:32.960]  And we've got to stand forward
[02:08:32.960 --> 02:08:34.960]  If you're involved
[02:08:34.960 --> 02:08:35.960]  We're going to make things change
[02:08:35.960 --> 02:08:36.960]  You mentioned earlier
[02:08:36.960 --> 02:08:38.960]  That there is breakthroughs coming
[02:08:38.960 --> 02:08:40.960]  And we've got to keep our foot on the pedal
[02:08:40.960 --> 02:08:41.960]  We've got to keep moving
[02:08:41.960 --> 02:08:43.960]  Because the church has put us in a situation
[02:08:43.960 --> 02:08:44.960]  As you said, Alex
[02:08:44.960 --> 02:08:46.960]  The church was asleep at the wheel
[02:08:46.960 --> 02:08:48.960]  There wasn't enough pastors behind
[02:08:48.960 --> 02:08:50.960]  The pulp that's telling the truth
[02:08:50.960 --> 02:08:52.960]  They got conformed to the government
[02:08:52.960 --> 02:08:54.960]  And that's the situation we're in today
[02:08:54.960 --> 02:08:56.960]  They weren't going to tell the truth
[02:08:56.960 --> 02:08:58.960]  The Lord had to use me as a Marine
[02:08:58.960 --> 02:08:59.960]  And come from the corporate world
[02:08:59.960 --> 02:09:00.960]  To be a pastor
[02:09:00.960 --> 02:09:01.960]  But whatever it takes
[02:09:01.960 --> 02:09:02.960]  We're going to do it for His purpose
[02:09:02.960 --> 02:09:03.960]  And His glory
[02:09:03.960 --> 02:09:05.960]  And people are waking up
[02:09:05.960 --> 02:09:06.960]  We go to these reawaken events
[02:09:06.960 --> 02:09:08.960]  And thousands and thousands of people come
[02:09:08.960 --> 02:09:09.960]  Millions come in
[02:09:09.960 --> 02:09:11.960]  We have patriots coming in
[02:09:11.960 --> 02:09:14.960]  And accepting Jesus Christ as their Lord and Savior
[02:09:14.960 --> 02:09:16.960]  We have Christians coming in
[02:09:16.960 --> 02:09:18.960]  We know how to be patriots
[02:09:18.960 --> 02:09:19.960]  Learning the Constitution
[02:09:19.960 --> 02:09:20.960]  Waking up to say
[02:09:20.960 --> 02:09:22.960]  What can I do to take action?
[02:09:22.960 --> 02:09:23.960]  You mentioned General Flynn
[02:09:23.960 --> 02:09:24.960]  That's what he says every day
[02:09:24.960 --> 02:09:26.960]  What are you going to do to take action?
[02:09:26.960 --> 02:09:27.960]  And that's a big leftist lie
[02:09:27.960 --> 02:09:28.960]  That this wasn't a Christian nation
[02:09:28.960 --> 02:09:30.960]  We allowed freedom of religion
[02:09:30.960 --> 02:09:31.960]  Of the First Amendment
[02:09:31.960 --> 02:09:34.960]  But it was undoubtedly founded on Christian values
[02:09:34.960 --> 02:09:35.960]  Absolutely
[02:09:35.960 --> 02:09:36.960]  Judeo-Christian values
[02:09:36.960 --> 02:09:38.960]  That's what the U.S. Constitution is
[02:09:38.960 --> 02:09:40.960]  And that was the original
[02:09:40.960 --> 02:09:41.960]  The original pastors were called
[02:09:41.960 --> 02:09:42.960]  The Black Robe Regiment
[02:09:42.960 --> 02:09:44.960]  They had a musket in one hand
[02:09:44.960 --> 02:09:45.960]  And the Bible in the other
[02:09:45.960 --> 02:09:46.960]  And we've lost that
[02:09:46.960 --> 02:09:47.960]  And it's time to get that back
[02:09:47.960 --> 02:09:48.960]  Or we will not have a country
[02:09:48.960 --> 02:09:49.960]  So do you agree with me
[02:09:49.960 --> 02:09:51.960]  Because you're more immersed in the clergy
[02:09:51.960 --> 02:09:53.960]  In the church than I am 100 times
[02:09:53.960 --> 02:09:55.960]  That I'm seeing finally some awakening
[02:09:55.960 --> 02:09:56.960]  In the church?
[02:09:56.960 --> 02:09:57.960]  Yes
[02:09:57.960 --> 02:09:58.960]  Because I go to random churches all the time
[02:09:58.960 --> 02:09:59.960]  I mean, I'm the type of guy
[02:09:59.960 --> 02:10:00.960]  That doesn't go to one
[02:10:00.960 --> 02:10:01.960]  The same one all the time
[02:10:01.960 --> 02:10:02.960]  I go to church sometimes twice a week
[02:10:02.960 --> 02:10:03.960]  Usually once a week
[02:10:03.960 --> 02:10:04.960]  And I just go to friends' churches
[02:10:04.960 --> 02:10:06.960]  And I'm just seeing big awakening
[02:10:06.960 --> 02:10:07.960]  Absolutely
[02:10:07.960 --> 02:10:08.960]  We see a remnant church
[02:10:08.960 --> 02:10:09.960]  Standing up right now
[02:10:09.960 --> 02:10:11.960]  And you see a conforming church
[02:10:11.960 --> 02:10:12.960]  You know, the last two and a half years
[02:10:12.960 --> 02:10:14.960]  Have been really tough for people
[02:10:14.960 --> 02:10:15.960]  But we're seeing a separation
[02:10:15.960 --> 02:10:16.960]  God is using this time
[02:10:16.960 --> 02:10:19.960]  To separate the fake from the truth
[02:10:19.960 --> 02:10:20.960]  Of his pulpit
[02:10:20.960 --> 02:10:22.960]  And those churches that are standing up for truth
[02:10:22.960 --> 02:10:23.960]  Are growing
[02:10:23.960 --> 02:10:25.960]  And they don't care about, you know
[02:10:25.960 --> 02:10:26.960]  Their tax status
[02:10:26.960 --> 02:10:28.960]  They don't care about the money coming in
[02:10:28.960 --> 02:10:29.960]  They care about truth
[02:10:29.960 --> 02:10:30.960]  And that is the Bible
[02:10:30.960 --> 02:10:31.960]  In this country
[02:10:31.960 --> 02:10:32.960]  Well, here's a microcosm
[02:10:32.960 --> 02:10:34.960]  My mother was raised Southern Baptist
[02:10:34.960 --> 02:10:35.960]  By her dad
[02:10:35.960 --> 02:10:36.960]  But her mom
[02:10:36.960 --> 02:10:37.960]  We've been here in Texas forever
[02:10:37.960 --> 02:10:38.960]  Had been, you know
[02:10:38.960 --> 02:10:40.960]  Her family gone to the First Methodist Church
[02:10:40.960 --> 02:10:41.960]  In downtown Austin
[02:10:41.960 --> 02:10:42.960]  Since, you know, her grandmother did
[02:10:42.960 --> 02:10:44.960]  So they would go a few times a year to that
[02:10:44.960 --> 02:10:45.960]  And my mom was a member
[02:10:45.960 --> 02:10:46.960]  Gave them money
[02:10:46.960 --> 02:10:47.960]  But they went full communist
[02:10:47.960 --> 02:10:49.960]  With literal drag queen story time
[02:10:49.960 --> 02:10:50.960]  She got out of the church
[02:10:50.960 --> 02:10:51.960]  Before that happened
[02:10:51.960 --> 02:10:53.960]  But she literally cried about it
[02:10:53.960 --> 02:10:55.960]  And so she was really dejected
[02:10:55.960 --> 02:10:57.960]  And I said, mom, go to some other churches
[02:10:57.960 --> 02:10:58.960]  To see what you like
[02:10:58.960 --> 02:11:00.960]  She went to a big, huge church in Round Rock
[02:11:00.960 --> 02:11:01.960]  Where they had 5,000 inside
[02:11:01.960 --> 02:11:04.960]  5,000 or so outside with Jumbotrons
[02:11:04.960 --> 02:11:05.960]  And the preacher was talking about
[02:11:05.960 --> 02:11:06.960]  The New World Order
[02:11:06.960 --> 02:11:07.960]  And the Mark of the Beast
[02:11:07.960 --> 02:11:08.960]  And the Globalist
[02:11:08.960 --> 02:11:09.960]  He needed to get back to the land
[02:11:09.960 --> 02:11:10.960]  And food
[02:11:10.960 --> 02:11:12.960]  And that all this is happening
[02:11:12.960 --> 02:11:14.960]  And she was so excited
[02:11:14.960 --> 02:11:15.960]  That she went to a big church
[02:11:15.960 --> 02:11:16.960]  In Round Rock
[02:11:16.960 --> 02:11:17.960]  I haven't been there yet
[02:11:17.960 --> 02:11:18.960]  And it was like an hour and a half
[02:11:18.960 --> 02:11:20.960]  We're firing rimstone preaching
[02:11:20.960 --> 02:11:21.960]  She loved it
[02:11:21.960 --> 02:11:22.960]  So again, a lot of churches
[02:11:22.960 --> 02:11:23.960]  Aren't churches anymore
[02:11:23.960 --> 02:11:24.960]  They're leftist outposts
[02:11:24.960 --> 02:11:27.960]  But others are reawakening
[02:11:27.960 --> 02:11:29.960]  Well, you have 20% of churches today
[02:11:29.960 --> 02:11:31.960]  That take a biblical world view
[02:11:31.960 --> 02:11:32.960]  That's it
[02:11:32.960 --> 02:11:33.960]  20%
[02:11:33.960 --> 02:11:36.960]  That means 80% have fallen into conforming
[02:11:36.960 --> 02:11:37.960]  If you don't take a biblical world view
[02:11:37.960 --> 02:11:38.960]  How can you trust the Bible?
[02:11:38.960 --> 02:11:39.960]  Let me explain
[02:11:39.960 --> 02:11:40.960]  This Methodist Church of Austin
[02:11:40.960 --> 02:11:42.960]  Has drag queen story time
[02:11:42.960 --> 02:11:45.960]  For kids at Sunday school
[02:11:45.960 --> 02:11:46.960]  And people think that's okay
[02:11:46.960 --> 02:11:49.960]  Literal, a pedophilic movement
[02:11:49.960 --> 02:11:50.960]  In a so-called church
[02:11:50.960 --> 02:11:53.960]  They've captured it
[02:11:53.960 --> 02:11:54.960]  That is so evil
[02:11:54.960 --> 02:11:55.960]  Think about the folks that paid
[02:11:55.960 --> 02:11:56.960]  To build that church
[02:11:56.960 --> 02:11:57.960]  180 years ago
[02:11:57.960 --> 02:11:59.960]  And now it's that
[02:11:59.960 --> 02:12:00.960]  That's right
[02:12:00.960 --> 02:12:01.960]  So how do we...
[02:12:01.960 --> 02:12:02.960]  What's the moment in history
[02:12:02.960 --> 02:12:03.960]  We've reached in?
[02:12:03.960 --> 02:12:04.960]  What do we do?
[02:12:04.960 --> 02:12:05.960]  This moment in history
[02:12:05.960 --> 02:12:06.960]  Is where we have to be
[02:12:06.960 --> 02:12:07.960]  The church of Philadelphia
[02:12:07.960 --> 02:12:09.960]  We have to not deny his name
[02:12:09.960 --> 02:12:11.960]  Do not deny his word
[02:12:11.960 --> 02:12:12.960]  We have to get in the word
[02:12:12.960 --> 02:12:13.960]  Again, the problems is
[02:12:13.960 --> 02:12:16.960]  And we see modern-day cemeteries
[02:12:16.960 --> 02:12:17.960]  I call them, seminaries
[02:12:17.960 --> 02:12:19.960]  45% of all new pastors
[02:12:19.960 --> 02:12:20.960]  In the United States of America
[02:12:20.960 --> 02:12:22.960]  Do not believe in a literal hell
[02:12:22.960 --> 02:12:23.960]  When you start doing that
[02:12:23.960 --> 02:12:25.960]  The Bible falls apart
[02:12:25.960 --> 02:12:26.960]  We need to start teaching
[02:12:26.960 --> 02:12:27.960]  The book of Revelation
[02:12:27.960 --> 02:12:28.960]  Oh, we forget God
[02:12:28.960 --> 02:12:29.960]  Hell is actually here, too
[02:12:29.960 --> 02:12:31.960]  Yes, exactly
[02:12:31.960 --> 02:12:32.960]  And I've had so many questions
[02:12:32.960 --> 02:12:34.960]  From people that are not even Christians
[02:12:34.960 --> 02:12:35.960]  About the book of Revelation
[02:12:35.960 --> 02:12:36.960]  In the last two and a half years
[02:12:36.960 --> 02:12:38.960]  Tell me more about this beast
[02:12:38.960 --> 02:12:39.960]  Well, that's what I'm seeing
[02:12:39.960 --> 02:12:40.960]  We have record listeners that say
[02:12:40.960 --> 02:12:41.960]  You led me to Christ, Alex
[02:12:41.960 --> 02:12:42.960]  Without even trying
[02:12:42.960 --> 02:12:44.960]  Because they see the Bible
[02:12:44.960 --> 02:12:46.960]  Being fulfilled on this broadcast
[02:12:46.960 --> 02:12:47.960]  It is, right before our very eyes
[02:12:47.960 --> 02:12:49.960]  Nobody thought it would happen this soon
[02:12:49.960 --> 02:12:51.960]  I mean, it's three, four years ago
[02:12:51.960 --> 02:12:52.960]  You thought, what's this antichrist fellow
[02:12:52.960 --> 02:12:53.960]  That's going to come out and see
[02:12:53.960 --> 02:12:55.960]  How could he fool the world?
[02:12:55.960 --> 02:12:57.960]  Well, welcome to 2023
[02:12:57.960 --> 02:12:58.960]  We're seeing it right before our very eyes
[02:12:58.960 --> 02:12:59.960]  And a lot of preachers say
[02:12:59.960 --> 02:13:00.960]  Well, praise God
[02:13:00.960 --> 02:13:01.960]  Don't fight it, Jesus coming back
[02:13:01.960 --> 02:13:02.960]  I say praise God
[02:13:02.960 --> 02:13:04.960]  As soon as Jesus comes, that's the better
[02:13:04.960 --> 02:13:05.960]  But at the same time
[02:13:05.960 --> 02:13:07.960]  We are supposed to do something in this time
[02:13:07.960 --> 02:13:08.960]  What are we supposed to do biblically
[02:13:08.960 --> 02:13:09.960]  During these end times?
[02:13:09.960 --> 02:13:10.960]  This is what the Lord tells us to do
[02:13:10.960 --> 02:13:11.960]  In Mark 16, 15
[02:13:11.960 --> 02:13:13.960]  Preach the gospel from east to west
[02:13:13.960 --> 02:13:15.960]  To north to south to every creature
[02:13:15.960 --> 02:13:17.960]  Then the saints stand back
[02:13:17.960 --> 02:13:18.960]  And politely clap
[02:13:18.960 --> 02:13:19.960]  And go to Sunday school
[02:13:19.960 --> 02:13:20.960]  And then leave
[02:13:20.960 --> 02:13:21.960]  We have to take action
[02:13:21.960 --> 02:13:24.960]  And take his word to the world
[02:13:24.960 --> 02:13:25.960]  Into the tough places
[02:13:25.960 --> 02:13:26.960]  Whether it's the border
[02:13:26.960 --> 02:13:28.960]  Whether it's Iran
[02:13:28.960 --> 02:13:29.960]  Because the people are ready now
[02:13:29.960 --> 02:13:30.960]  They're ready
[02:13:30.960 --> 02:13:31.960]  They're ready for revival
[02:13:31.960 --> 02:13:32.960]  We're in a spirit of revival
[02:13:32.960 --> 02:13:34.960]  Like this country's never seen
[02:13:34.960 --> 02:13:35.960]  This is back to the...
[02:13:35.960 --> 02:13:36.960]  What is your spirit?
[02:13:36.960 --> 02:13:38.960]  What does the Holy Spirit tell you is about to happen?
[02:13:38.960 --> 02:13:39.960]  We're going to have the greatest revival
[02:13:39.960 --> 02:13:40.960]  Well, several things
[02:13:40.960 --> 02:13:42.960]  It's going to get darker
[02:13:42.960 --> 02:13:44.960]  There's going to be much more exposure coming
[02:13:44.960 --> 02:13:45.960]  There's going to be judgment coming
[02:13:45.960 --> 02:13:47.960]  And we're going to see a revival
[02:13:47.960 --> 02:13:48.960]  Like the world has never seen
[02:13:48.960 --> 02:13:50.960]  And God's allowing that to force us to make the choice
[02:13:50.960 --> 02:13:51.960]  Exactly
[02:13:51.960 --> 02:13:53.960]  What's most important in our lives?
[02:13:53.960 --> 02:13:54.960]  Is it God?
[02:13:54.960 --> 02:13:56.960]  Or is it the world that we've been conformed to
[02:13:56.960 --> 02:13:57.960]  We've been channeled, programmed
[02:13:57.960 --> 02:13:59.960]  By the fake news and all the other...
[02:13:59.960 --> 02:14:00.960]  And people that keep serving evil
[02:14:00.960 --> 02:14:02.960]  And I'm not perfect, but I certainly choose God
[02:14:02.960 --> 02:14:04.960]  They need to know it's a trap
[02:14:04.960 --> 02:14:05.960]  The more you give in to the devil
[02:14:05.960 --> 02:14:07.960]  The more he's going to demand
[02:14:07.960 --> 02:14:08.960]  That's right
[02:14:08.960 --> 02:14:09.960]  That's right
[02:14:09.960 --> 02:14:11.960]  Not only demand
[02:14:11.960 --> 02:14:13.960]  As long as you're off on the side
[02:14:13.960 --> 02:14:14.960]  If you're asleep, that's what he wants
[02:14:14.960 --> 02:14:15.960]  That's the problem right now
[02:14:15.960 --> 02:14:17.960]  We have in the United States and the world
[02:14:17.960 --> 02:14:18.960]  We're indifferent
[02:14:18.960 --> 02:14:19.960]  That's the church of...
[02:14:19.960 --> 02:14:20.960]  That's the screw-tape letters
[02:14:20.960 --> 02:14:21.960]  Yeah
[02:14:21.960 --> 02:14:22.960]  Indifferent
[02:14:22.960 --> 02:14:23.960]  You're indifferent
[02:14:23.960 --> 02:14:24.960]  Indifferent is the worst thing
[02:14:24.960 --> 02:14:26.960]  You could possibly be in life
[02:14:26.960 --> 02:14:27.960]  You're either all in
[02:14:27.960 --> 02:14:28.960]  Or you're all out
[02:14:28.960 --> 02:14:29.960]  Well, Christ said that
[02:14:29.960 --> 02:14:30.960]  You're lukewarm
[02:14:30.960 --> 02:14:32.960]  I spit you out of my mouth
[02:14:32.960 --> 02:14:34.960]  To the church of Laodicea
[02:14:34.960 --> 02:14:36.960]  That's the church age we're in today
[02:14:36.960 --> 02:14:37.960]  Correct me if I'm wrong
[02:14:37.960 --> 02:14:38.960]  God is...
[02:14:38.960 --> 02:14:39.960]  Son of God is saying
[02:14:39.960 --> 02:14:41.960]  You're worse than evil to sit on the fence
[02:14:41.960 --> 02:14:42.960]  Exactly
[02:14:42.960 --> 02:14:43.960]  Explain that to me
[02:14:43.960 --> 02:14:44.960]  The reason is because
[02:14:44.960 --> 02:14:46.960]  At least when you know evil is evil
[02:14:46.960 --> 02:14:47.960]  And evil calls evil
[02:14:47.960 --> 02:14:48.960]  You know they're evil
[02:14:48.960 --> 02:14:49.960]  The worst is that
[02:14:49.960 --> 02:14:50.960]  The person that sits on the fence
[02:14:50.960 --> 02:14:51.960]  Goes both ways
[02:14:51.960 --> 02:14:53.960]  You know, when you get here
[02:14:53.960 --> 02:14:55.960]  I'll read the Bible
[02:14:55.960 --> 02:14:56.960]  If it fits my needs
[02:14:56.960 --> 02:14:57.960]  You're lukewarm
[02:14:57.960 --> 02:14:58.960]  You're not in
[02:14:58.960 --> 02:14:59.960]  You've got to be all in
[02:14:59.960 --> 02:15:00.960]  And the ones obviously
[02:15:00.960 --> 02:15:02.960]  He wants are the ones that are all in for him
[02:15:02.960 --> 02:15:03.960]  Because there's nothing more frustrating
[02:15:03.960 --> 02:15:04.960]  Than somebody that keeps jerking you around
[02:15:04.960 --> 02:15:05.960]  Exactly
[02:15:05.960 --> 02:15:07.960]  Nothing more frustrating than something
[02:15:07.960 --> 02:15:09.960]  That's indifferent about anything in life
[02:15:09.960 --> 02:15:10.960]  Take a stand
[02:15:10.960 --> 02:15:11.960]  Take action
[02:15:11.960 --> 02:15:13.960]  At least the enemy's all in for Satan
[02:15:13.960 --> 02:15:14.960]  That's right
[02:15:14.960 --> 02:15:15.960]  Satan, you know his plan
[02:15:15.960 --> 02:15:17.960]  It's the destroy man
[02:15:17.960 --> 02:15:18.960]  That's the fault
[02:15:18.960 --> 02:15:19.960]  And boy, isn't that all illustrated now
[02:15:19.960 --> 02:15:21.960]  The globalists rule the earth
[02:15:21.960 --> 02:15:22.960]  But they want to destroy it
[02:15:22.960 --> 02:15:23.960]  Yep
[02:15:23.960 --> 02:15:24.960]  Why is that?
[02:15:24.960 --> 02:15:25.960]  Because they have their marching orders
[02:15:25.960 --> 02:15:26.960]  From Satan
[02:15:26.960 --> 02:15:27.960]  The 13 bloodlines
[02:15:27.960 --> 02:15:28.960]  It all comes back to the Garden of Eden
[02:15:28.960 --> 02:15:30.960]  But Satan knows he's a loser
[02:15:30.960 --> 02:15:31.960]  Why is he doing it?
[02:15:31.960 --> 02:15:32.960]  Let's talk about it when we come back
[02:15:32.960 --> 02:15:33.960]  And what you saw on the border
[02:15:33.960 --> 02:15:34.960]  Pastor Dave Scarlet
[02:15:34.960 --> 02:15:36.960]  I'm so glad that you're here in town

[02:15:47.960 --> 02:15:48.960]  Stay with us
[02:15:48.960 --> 02:16:00.960]  I'm taking a lot of supplements over the years
[02:16:00.960 --> 02:16:01.960]  Since high school
[02:16:01.960 --> 02:16:02.960]  And they had great effects
[02:16:02.960 --> 02:16:04.960]  And the science has gotten better and better
[02:16:04.960 --> 02:16:06.960]  And better over the years
[02:16:06.960 --> 02:16:08.960]  And now with all the things we're bombarded with
[02:16:08.960 --> 02:16:10.960]  And the water and the food
[02:16:10.960 --> 02:16:12.960]  And the feminizing factors
[02:16:12.960 --> 02:16:13.960]  It is more important than ever

[02:16:57.960 --> 02:17:02.960]  I have been in a 28 year marathon battle
[02:17:02.960 --> 02:17:03.960]  With a globalist
[02:17:03.960 --> 02:17:05.960]  I have come from nowhere
[02:17:05.960 --> 02:17:07.960]  To the very heights of politics
[02:17:07.960 --> 02:17:09.960]  Not just in America, but the world
[02:17:09.960 --> 02:17:12.960]  We are engaging the globalist
[02:17:12.960 --> 02:17:15.960]  At point blank range in the information war
[02:17:15.960 --> 02:17:17.960]  But I don't deserve the credit
[02:17:17.960 --> 02:17:18.960]  Yes, I've persevered
[02:17:18.960 --> 02:17:20.960]  But the listeners and viewers
[02:17:20.960 --> 02:17:21.960]  Who support InfoWars
[02:17:21.960 --> 02:17:22.960]  For the real reason
[02:17:22.960 --> 02:17:24.960]  We've had the success
[02:17:24.960 --> 02:17:25.960]  We're having now
[02:17:25.960 --> 02:17:26.960]  The greatest victories
[02:17:26.960 --> 02:17:28.960]  In the fight against the new order
[02:17:28.960 --> 02:17:29.960]  We've ever had
[02:17:29.960 --> 02:17:31.960]  We are now entering
[02:17:31.960 --> 02:17:34.960]  The final mile of the marathon
[02:17:34.960 --> 02:17:36.960]  And that's why today
[02:17:36.960 --> 02:17:37.960]  It's more important than ever
[02:17:37.960 --> 02:17:38.960]  To realize how important
[02:17:38.960 --> 02:17:39.960]  You've been in this fight
[02:17:39.960 --> 02:17:40.960]  And to continue
[02:17:40.960 --> 02:17:42.960]  In the efforts you've been carrying out
[02:17:42.960 --> 02:17:43.960]  And to intensify them
[02:17:43.960 --> 02:17:44.960]  God bless you all
[02:17:44.960 --> 02:17:45.960]  I salute you
[02:17:45.960 --> 02:17:46.960]  I thank you

[02:17:51.960 --> 02:17:52.960]  And this streak is happening
[02:17:52.960 --> 02:17:54.960]  The fight is my fight

[02:19:38.800 --> 02:19:41.760]  two-market 95% of humanoid at the price we're selling it.
[02:19:41.760 --> 02:19:44.480]  You're not going to find any of this anywhere near that.
[02:19:44.480 --> 02:19:49.880]  These similar formulas with the same formulas sell for up to 200% more than we're selling
[02:19:49.880 --> 02:19:50.880]  these.
[02:19:50.880 --> 02:19:59.960]  InfoWars MD, now available exclusively at infowarsstore.com, a true 360 win.
[02:19:59.960 --> 02:20:22.400]  Meeting of frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[02:20:22.400 --> 02:20:27.080]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[02:20:27.080 --> 02:20:30.360]  We're going to cover some of what Dave Scarlet saw on the board about.
[02:20:30.360 --> 02:20:35.160]  He's going to be on during the first hour of the war room today, 3pm central standard
[02:20:35.160 --> 02:20:36.160]  time.
[02:20:36.160 --> 02:20:39.800]  Pastor, continuing, preach for us because I'll interrupt a lot.
[02:20:39.800 --> 02:20:43.240]  What you saw at the border, just everything that's happening, Congress, your view on
[02:20:43.240 --> 02:20:44.240]  the world right now.
[02:20:44.240 --> 02:20:48.920]  Yeah, we're at a tipping point as General Flynn has many times said, our feet are over
[02:20:48.920 --> 02:20:50.640]  the edges as a nation.
[02:20:50.640 --> 02:20:54.920]  The whole world is looking to the United States of America for help, but our help doesn't
[02:20:54.920 --> 02:20:57.680]  come from a pope or a pastor or a prophet.
[02:20:57.680 --> 02:21:00.880]  It comes from the living Christ and our Lord and Savior.
[02:21:00.880 --> 02:21:01.880]  That's what we need to do.
[02:21:01.880 --> 02:21:04.880]  We've got to get on our knees because this is a moment in time.
[02:21:04.880 --> 02:21:10.480]  I was down at the border, at the Texas border, and I was just with Sheriff Lam and Sheriff
[02:21:10.480 --> 02:21:15.040]  Daniels in Arizona, so I saw firsthand what we're doing, what they're doing.
[02:21:15.040 --> 02:21:18.720]  I saw one of your segments earlier about the fentanyl, how it's killing people.
[02:21:18.720 --> 02:21:24.000]  The terrorists coming across, that's what they call getaways, 8 out of 10 people.
[02:21:24.000 --> 02:21:25.000]  They're getaways.
[02:21:25.000 --> 02:21:26.000]  They're parts of...
[02:21:26.000 --> 02:21:28.440]  A country is not a country that doesn't have a border.
[02:21:28.440 --> 02:21:29.440]  No border.
[02:21:29.440 --> 02:21:32.720]  The way I asked the question to people coming that were on the other side of the border,
[02:21:32.720 --> 02:21:35.240]  there's like 500 coming in in one hour.
[02:21:35.240 --> 02:21:38.880]  In Arizona, I said, would you have come here under President Trump?
[02:21:38.880 --> 02:21:39.880]  They said, absolutely not.
[02:21:39.880 --> 02:21:40.880]  I said, why are you coming?
[02:21:40.880 --> 02:21:43.160]  Joe Biden, because he's told us open borders.
[02:21:43.160 --> 02:21:44.160]  He told them come.
[02:21:44.160 --> 02:21:46.320]  He immediately surged the border.
[02:21:46.320 --> 02:21:47.320]  And they did.
[02:21:47.320 --> 02:21:48.320]  And they did.
[02:21:48.320 --> 02:21:49.320]  And they have saw...
[02:21:49.320 --> 02:21:50.320]  And this is dangerous journalism you're doing.
[02:21:50.320 --> 02:21:51.320]  I've been down there a bunch too.
[02:21:51.320 --> 02:21:52.320]  It's dangerous.
[02:21:52.320 --> 02:21:54.520]  We were scouted out by the cartel.
[02:21:54.520 --> 02:21:59.600]  They know exactly who we are and they threatened us many, many times and had to wear bulletproof
[02:21:59.600 --> 02:22:03.880]  vests when we go down there and got a chance to ride with the sheriffs and see exactly
[02:22:03.880 --> 02:22:04.880]  what they have to do.
[02:22:04.880 --> 02:22:08.120]  So you're doing more dangerous stuff as a pastor than as a Marine?
[02:22:08.120 --> 02:22:09.120]  Yeah.
[02:22:09.120 --> 02:22:13.280]  I have had three attempts on my life as a pastor and I've never had an attempt on my
[02:22:13.280 --> 02:22:14.800]  life as a Marine.
[02:22:14.800 --> 02:22:16.640]  Well, continue, pastor.
[02:22:16.640 --> 02:22:17.640]  It's...
[02:22:17.640 --> 02:22:18.640]  We're in a war.
[02:22:18.640 --> 02:22:20.960]  It's a spiritual war, but it's also a physical war.
[02:22:20.960 --> 02:22:25.920]  It's the largest psi-up, you know, war we've ever seen, fifth generation as General Flynn
[02:22:25.920 --> 02:22:27.720]  likes to refer to it.
[02:22:27.720 --> 02:22:28.720]  And we have to be all in.
[02:22:28.720 --> 02:22:31.080]  There's going to be no nation left.
[02:22:31.080 --> 02:22:34.320]  But the exciting thing is that God has not done with this equal nation.
[02:22:34.320 --> 02:22:38.480]  As long as we, the remnant, are going to stand up and take action, glorious things are going
[02:22:38.480 --> 02:22:39.480]  to happen.
[02:22:39.480 --> 02:22:40.480]  We talk about tent revivals.
[02:22:40.480 --> 02:22:41.480]  We're going to start doing tent revivals.
[02:22:41.480 --> 02:22:42.480]  We've already started.
[02:22:42.480 --> 02:22:45.320]  They're going to be in every single state, all 50 states, and then we're going to take
[02:22:45.320 --> 02:22:46.320]  it to the world.
[02:22:46.320 --> 02:22:47.320]  And you're starting in East Texas.
[02:22:47.320 --> 02:22:48.320]  That's a great place.
[02:22:48.320 --> 02:22:49.320]  Yeah.
[02:22:49.320 --> 02:22:50.320]  New location in Texas.
[02:22:50.320 --> 02:22:51.320]  It's nothing like Texas.
[02:22:51.320 --> 02:22:52.320]  I love to be in Texas.
[02:22:52.320 --> 02:22:53.320]  What made you come to Texas?
[02:22:53.320 --> 02:22:54.320]  To people.
[02:22:54.320 --> 02:22:58.080]  Texas, you know, you see the world coming, you know, I asked one of the sheriffs when
[02:22:58.080 --> 02:22:59.080]  I was in Arizona.
[02:22:59.080 --> 02:23:01.320]  I said, are we in a civil war?
[02:23:01.320 --> 02:23:02.320]  Are we going to go to a civil war?
[02:23:02.320 --> 02:23:03.320]  It was my question.
[02:23:03.320 --> 02:23:05.800]  He said, we're already in a civil war.
[02:23:05.800 --> 02:23:07.160]  It's just civil right now.
[02:23:07.160 --> 02:23:08.680]  Well, that's why they're attacking our police.
[02:23:08.680 --> 02:23:09.680]  The police aren't permanent.
[02:23:09.680 --> 02:23:10.680]  They've got a hard job.
[02:23:10.680 --> 02:23:11.680]  There's some bad ones.
[02:23:11.680 --> 02:23:13.200]  But statistically, they're so dedicated.
[02:23:13.200 --> 02:23:14.760]  They're so hardworking.
[02:23:14.760 --> 02:23:19.120]  And that's why they put in all these Soros DAs to persecute and prosecute them when they
[02:23:19.120 --> 02:23:20.120]  do their job.
[02:23:20.120 --> 02:23:22.120]  And we've got to really stand with our police.
[02:23:22.120 --> 02:23:23.120]  We do.
[02:23:23.120 --> 02:23:24.120]  We do.
[02:23:24.120 --> 02:23:26.560]  I walked, I was with them for four or five days riding with them.
[02:23:26.560 --> 02:23:28.080]  See what they have to go through every day.
[02:23:28.080 --> 02:23:29.640]  See the threats of the cartel.
[02:23:29.640 --> 02:23:31.120]  See the dangers of fentanyl.
[02:23:31.120 --> 02:23:34.280]  Oh, law enforcement on the border is most, it's hellish.
[02:23:34.280 --> 02:23:35.280]  It is.
[02:23:35.280 --> 02:23:38.360]  Rifles pointed at them, you know, red scopes pointed at them.
[02:23:38.360 --> 02:23:39.360]  They know who they are.
[02:23:39.360 --> 02:23:42.440]  Well, they get killed all the time and it's not even a blip in the news.
[02:23:42.440 --> 02:23:43.440]  Not a blip.
[02:23:43.440 --> 02:23:48.960]  But they keep doing it because they love what they're doing and they love this country.
[02:23:48.960 --> 02:23:49.960]  We don't have enough of them.
[02:23:49.960 --> 02:23:51.400]  We don't support them enough.
[02:23:51.400 --> 02:23:53.680]  And I know they thank independent journalists when we go down there.
[02:23:53.680 --> 02:23:54.680]  They do.
[02:23:54.680 --> 02:23:56.640]  We met with the border patrol a year ago and they told us the same number.
[02:23:56.640 --> 02:23:59.320]  They said, look, it's 10 million coming in a year under Biden.
[02:23:59.320 --> 02:24:00.320]  This was last year.
[02:24:00.320 --> 02:24:02.600]  They said eight out of 10, get away.
[02:24:02.600 --> 02:24:03.840]  We don't even catch them.
[02:24:03.840 --> 02:24:07.320]  And those are the bad ones because they don't want to catch their order to release.
[02:24:07.320 --> 02:24:09.800]  Yeah, you can't make it up.
[02:24:09.800 --> 02:24:12.680]  What else did you witness on the border and how people go watch these amazing videos?
[02:24:12.680 --> 02:24:16.760]  We're showing some of our TV viewers for radio listeners who aren't seeing this.
[02:24:16.760 --> 02:24:19.120]  How do people go watch the incredible footage you gave us?
[02:24:19.120 --> 02:24:21.160]  This is some of the most incredible footage I've seen.
[02:24:21.160 --> 02:24:22.160]  Yeah, we have more coming.
[02:24:22.160 --> 02:24:26.760]  There's going to be a documentary that comes out to HisGlory.tv in March timeframe.
[02:24:26.760 --> 02:24:28.880]  Some of it is already out on HisGlory.tv.
[02:24:28.880 --> 02:24:29.880]  Tell us about the...
[02:24:29.880 --> 02:24:30.880]  You've already made documentaries.
[02:24:30.880 --> 02:24:33.440]  Tell us about the past documentaries and the new one in production.
[02:24:33.440 --> 02:24:38.720]  We have the Texas border that we did, a Texas trip to the border.
[02:24:38.720 --> 02:24:40.840]  We have the Arizona border trip that will be coming out.
[02:24:40.840 --> 02:24:44.840]  We did a documentary with Mickey Willis with Israel.
[02:24:44.840 --> 02:24:47.160]  We went to Israel for 10 days with them.
[02:24:47.160 --> 02:24:48.400]  That's coming out.
[02:24:48.400 --> 02:24:49.400]  Capital punishment.
[02:24:49.400 --> 02:24:50.400]  We helped.
[02:24:50.400 --> 02:24:54.200]  We got a lot of pushback for getting the movie January 6th, Capital Punishment with Nick
[02:24:54.200 --> 02:24:55.200]  Cersei and Chris Burgard.
[02:24:55.200 --> 02:24:57.200]  You can get that at HisGlory.tv.
[02:24:57.200 --> 02:25:00.800]  Probably the most censored movie ever because they lied to us about January 6th and the
[02:25:00.800 --> 02:25:01.800]  truth is coming out.
[02:25:01.800 --> 02:25:02.800]  They're suppressing the 14th.
[02:25:02.800 --> 02:25:09.000]  Did you see Ray Apps confess to the committee and they held it for almost a year that he
[02:25:09.000 --> 02:25:11.120]  helped quote, orchestrate the break-in?
[02:25:11.120 --> 02:25:12.120]  Yep.
[02:25:12.120 --> 02:25:13.520]  He said, I orchestrated it.
[02:25:13.520 --> 02:25:15.720]  He did his own words.
[02:25:15.720 --> 02:25:17.720]  And they said, that's okay.
[02:25:17.720 --> 02:25:21.440]  Our own old Troyer didn't go in, was with me, tried to keep people out.
[02:25:21.440 --> 02:25:23.680]  He was in died and facing ear and gell right now.
[02:25:23.680 --> 02:25:24.680]  What they're doing?
[02:25:24.680 --> 02:25:26.880]  You're on his shoulder now, like an over an hour.
[02:25:26.880 --> 02:25:27.880]  Yeah.
[02:25:27.880 --> 02:25:28.880]  This is the United States of America.
[02:25:28.880 --> 02:25:30.880]  You wouldn't think this would happen in the United States of America.
[02:25:30.880 --> 02:25:32.120]  Well, it's clown world.
[02:25:32.120 --> 02:25:33.120]  It is.
[02:25:33.120 --> 02:25:37.280]  Did you see how the University of Southern California banned the word field?
[02:25:37.280 --> 02:25:40.120]  Oh, because blacks were slaves in fields.
[02:25:40.120 --> 02:25:41.600]  Well, blacks were slaves on ships.
[02:25:41.600 --> 02:25:42.600]  Do we ban ships?
[02:25:42.600 --> 02:25:44.200]  I mean, what is that about?
[02:25:44.200 --> 02:25:46.280]  Well, it's even going into our military.
[02:25:46.280 --> 02:25:47.760]  You know, I'm a Marine.
[02:25:47.760 --> 02:25:51.760]  And now they want to use pronouns in the Marines.
[02:25:51.760 --> 02:25:54.040]  Like G, you know.
[02:25:54.040 --> 02:25:57.000]  No his or no boy and girl.
[02:25:57.000 --> 02:26:01.120]  It's just, you know, I deal with a lot of former generals.
[02:26:01.120 --> 02:26:05.080]  They're just, they're up in arms about what's happening to our military and we need to fight
[02:26:05.080 --> 02:26:06.080]  back.
[02:26:06.080 --> 02:26:07.360]  It's a purposeful destruction of it.
[02:26:07.360 --> 02:26:09.000]  It is a purposeful.
[02:26:09.000 --> 02:26:10.600]  And that's exactly what General Boykin said.
[02:26:10.600 --> 02:26:13.080]  I asked him the question, how did this happen?
[02:26:13.080 --> 02:26:14.960]  He said it was Obama.
[02:26:14.960 --> 02:26:18.880]  Obama getting rid of all the right generals and putting in his, well, they admit this
[02:26:18.880 --> 02:26:22.880]  is the third administration of Obama, exactly.
[02:26:22.880 --> 02:26:26.080]  General McInerney says that all the time because I'm a Biden because it's being run
[02:26:26.080 --> 02:26:28.760]  by Obama.
[02:26:28.760 --> 02:26:32.960]  I think we're winning peacefully and I don't want to call for violence because it'll be
[02:26:32.960 --> 02:26:33.960]  spun.
[02:26:33.960 --> 02:26:34.960]  It'll be directed wrong.
[02:26:34.960 --> 02:26:37.480]  But our founders finally at a point did fight back.
[02:26:37.480 --> 02:26:41.400]  Is there any point where we're not at this point, we're not calling for it, but if there's
[02:26:41.400 --> 02:26:46.200]  enough attacks, enough things like 1776, at what point do we defend ourselves when they're
[02:26:46.200 --> 02:26:48.600]  taking us to FEMA camps, forcefully injecting us?
[02:26:48.600 --> 02:26:50.960]  Yeah, well, there's going to have to be a point.
[02:26:50.960 --> 02:26:51.960]  You mentioned it.
[02:26:51.960 --> 02:26:53.400]  You know, our forefathers had a fight.
[02:26:53.400 --> 02:26:57.560]  They had a, the Black Royal Brudgemen had a Bible in one hand, a musk in the other.
[02:26:57.560 --> 02:27:01.000]  And they were Christians in the whole Old Testament, much the new Christ said, sell your
[02:27:01.000 --> 02:27:02.320]  cloak by a sword.
[02:27:02.320 --> 02:27:04.160]  That was the time for sacrifice.
[02:27:04.160 --> 02:27:06.240]  That was the time for him to do what he did.
[02:27:06.240 --> 02:27:09.480]  But I'm not calling for violence, folks, just we're not directing it.
[02:27:09.480 --> 02:27:12.200]  It would, it would, it would help the enemy at this point, but it's something, they're
[02:27:12.200 --> 02:27:15.960]  taking us to FEMA camps, they're forcefully injecting us, they're making us take the mark
[02:27:15.960 --> 02:27:18.120]  of the beast.
[02:27:18.120 --> 02:27:21.320]  Do Christians in the tribulation physically fight back?
[02:27:21.320 --> 02:27:22.480]  Yes, they will.
[02:27:22.480 --> 02:27:23.480]  They do.
[02:27:23.480 --> 02:27:27.440]  Well, I was in Israel two weeks, or two months ago, an Israel higher, the one of the most
[02:27:27.440 --> 02:27:30.240]  high ranking Israeli generals gave me a gift.
[02:27:30.240 --> 02:27:34.840]  And then that gift was a book with all the 6 million Jewish people that were killed in
[02:27:34.840 --> 02:27:37.320]  the Holocaust because nobody stood up.
[02:27:37.320 --> 02:27:38.480]  I thought it wasn't going to happen.
[02:27:38.480 --> 02:27:40.120]  Nobody else is going to take care of the problem.
[02:27:40.120 --> 02:27:43.840]  Well, there's not only one person who's going to take the problem, take care of the problem,
[02:27:43.840 --> 02:27:48.200]  that's our Lord and Savior, but he wants us to get off the fence and take action for his
[02:27:48.200 --> 02:27:49.200]  namesake.
[02:27:49.200 --> 02:27:52.440]  So we better work hard peacefully now so we don't have to do it physically.
[02:27:52.440 --> 02:27:53.440]  Exactly right.
[02:27:53.440 --> 02:27:55.560]  I know God, everything's preordained.
[02:27:55.560 --> 02:27:59.320]  God gives us free will, but God knows the outcome, you know, that's that whole paradox,
[02:27:59.320 --> 02:28:02.440]  but you see it, but isn't almost like choose your adventure.
[02:28:02.440 --> 02:28:03.560]  God has a plan.
[02:28:03.560 --> 02:28:04.560]  We follow God's plan.
[02:28:04.560 --> 02:28:05.560]  Everything's great.
[02:28:05.560 --> 02:28:10.080]  He can become enslaved and there's different deviations of that.
[02:28:10.080 --> 02:28:11.440]  God works through us with free will.
[02:28:11.440 --> 02:28:12.440]  Doesn't God?
[02:28:12.440 --> 02:28:13.440]  He does.
[02:28:13.440 --> 02:28:14.440]  He does.
[02:28:14.440 --> 02:28:18.880]  So we kind of, we're kind of choosing what version of the, of Armageddon we get.
[02:28:18.880 --> 02:28:19.880]  That's right.
[02:28:19.880 --> 02:28:20.880]  Explain that to me.
[02:28:20.880 --> 02:28:21.880]  Yeah.
[02:28:21.880 --> 02:28:22.880]  So, you know, there's a choice.
[02:28:22.880 --> 02:28:23.880]  God gives us free will.
[02:28:23.880 --> 02:28:24.880]  He wants us to choose us.
[02:28:24.880 --> 02:28:26.640]  And the precept is his word.
[02:28:26.640 --> 02:28:29.960]  If you follow his word, things will never go perfect for you.
[02:28:29.960 --> 02:28:31.760]  You'll be attacked, but he's there with you.
[02:28:31.760 --> 02:28:32.760]  You got that shalom.
[02:28:32.760 --> 02:28:33.760]  You got that peace.
[02:28:33.760 --> 02:28:37.600]  So when you go off is where there's, there's repercussions of that word, uh, getting away
[02:28:37.600 --> 02:28:38.600]  from his word.
[02:28:38.600 --> 02:28:41.960]  The indifference is where the problems at the people, this is the most important question.
[02:28:41.960 --> 02:28:42.960]  Stay there, pastor.
[02:28:42.960 --> 02:28:45.320]  We're going to come back because this is what it's all about.
[02:28:45.320 --> 02:28:48.840]  That peace, that, that quiet place, the most attacking David talked about.
[02:28:48.840 --> 02:28:49.840]  How do we reach that?
[02:28:49.840 --> 02:28:51.240]  Because I've reached that only every once in a while.
[02:28:51.240 --> 02:28:53.440]  I have the most powerful thoughts when I can get there.
[02:28:53.440 --> 02:28:54.680]  How do we get there all the time?
[02:28:54.680 --> 02:28:58.680]  Stay there.
[02:28:58.680 --> 02:29:02.520]  In full wars is winning in full wars is reaching more people than ever.
[02:29:02.520 --> 02:29:05.880]  We were supposed to be off the air months and months and months ago, mainstream media
[02:29:05.880 --> 02:29:08.040]  told you, but it's not true.
[02:29:08.040 --> 02:29:10.160]  They told you we were going to be shut down.
[02:29:10.160 --> 02:29:12.240]  They told you we owed a billion and a half dollars.
[02:29:12.240 --> 02:29:13.240]  None of that's true.
[02:29:13.240 --> 02:29:14.560]  It's all being appealed.
[02:29:14.560 --> 02:29:19.080]  They want you to think info wars is dead, but if you simply stand up and support info
[02:29:19.080 --> 02:29:23.560]  wars, we've got years and years of appeals and we will not be taken off the air.
[02:29:23.560 --> 02:29:27.200]  But if they can convince you that we've been shut down, they're going to win.
[02:29:27.200 --> 02:29:29.680]  Don't let the globalist sigh up you and your family.

[02:29:38.960 --> 02:29:39.960]  not worked.
[02:29:39.960 --> 02:29:41.520]  Thanks for keeping us on air.

[02:30:25.280 --> 02:30:33.680]  I also need you to wear masks and I also need you to only shop at mega corporations.
[02:30:33.680 --> 02:30:40.680]  That way we can consolidate control and bankrupt the world economy, leaving companies that
[02:30:40.680 --> 02:30:42.680]  only I own.
[02:30:42.680 --> 02:30:43.680]  Profitable.
[02:30:43.680 --> 02:30:45.680]  You will then be my slaves.

[02:30:59.680 --> 02:31:01.680]  You want to stop their globalist agenda?
[02:31:01.680 --> 02:31:07.200]  Well, so do I and I've been the most affected individual in the fight against the globalist
[02:31:07.200 --> 02:31:09.680]  and I've got their number and I know how to bring them down.

[02:31:22.480 --> 02:31:25.360]  to back down and I'll never give up but I could give out.

[02:31:58.680 --> 02:32:01.240]  It's a post COVID world now.
[02:32:01.240 --> 02:32:05.000]  Americans have lost trust in their doctors and the healthcare system.
[02:32:05.000 --> 02:32:06.240]  There's a solution.
[02:32:06.240 --> 02:32:07.240]  The wellness company.

[02:32:45.560 --> 02:32:46.560]  living in.
[02:32:46.560 --> 02:32:53.240]  So go to onlinehealthnow.com and check out the wellness company for a low monthly fee.

[02:33:00.040 --> 02:33:20.800]  Leading of frontal assault on the lies of the new world order, it's Alex Jones, big brother,
[02:33:20.800 --> 02:33:24.440]  mainstream media, government coverups.
[02:33:24.440 --> 02:33:31.200]  If you want to stop tyranny, well, so does he live from the info wars.com studios.
[02:33:31.200 --> 02:33:33.200]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:33:33.200 --> 02:33:34.200]  Pastor Dave Scarlett's here.
[02:33:34.200 --> 02:33:38.440]  He'll be on in the first hour of the war room today with the great Owen Shroyer pastor
[02:33:38.440 --> 02:33:46.680]  getting to a key point about King David talking about that quiet place of the most time or
[02:33:46.680 --> 02:33:47.680]  that third heaven.
[02:33:47.680 --> 02:33:48.680]  Yeah.
[02:33:48.680 --> 02:33:49.680]  We got earth.
[02:33:49.680 --> 02:33:56.880]  And the third heavens in an interdimensional universe of God that so many people have never
[02:33:56.880 --> 02:33:57.880]  even experienced.
[02:33:57.880 --> 02:33:59.440]  I've only experienced it a few times.
[02:33:59.440 --> 02:34:02.440]  It's total commitment, total completion.
[02:34:02.440 --> 02:34:06.120]  You're with God beyond just the Holy Spirit convicting you, but you're interfacing with
[02:34:06.120 --> 02:34:10.600]  God and just there's a total peace or shalom you talked about.
[02:34:10.600 --> 02:34:16.000]  How do we, how do I, how do we spend more time in that place?
[02:34:16.000 --> 02:34:18.120]  The shalom is the Hebrew word for peace.
[02:34:18.120 --> 02:34:21.080]  That is that total peace that can only come from God.
[02:34:21.080 --> 02:34:24.600]  And the way you do that is you got to get, get, immerse yourself in the word.
[02:34:24.600 --> 02:34:29.320]  And once we're in the word, meditate on his word, listen for his still voice.
[02:34:29.320 --> 02:34:30.320]  We just get in.
[02:34:30.320 --> 02:34:31.640]  Sometimes we get in the word.
[02:34:31.640 --> 02:34:34.920]  Sometimes we meditate, but we don't listen for him to talk back to us.
[02:34:34.920 --> 02:34:36.520]  We're off too fast.
[02:34:36.520 --> 02:34:41.240]  We get into that meditation and we just in tune to his spirit of the Lord.
[02:34:41.240 --> 02:34:45.720]  He will touch us and you get those moments in time like I just felt right now where his
[02:34:45.720 --> 02:34:46.720]  spirit is here.
[02:34:46.720 --> 02:34:47.720]  He's with you.
[02:34:47.720 --> 02:34:48.720]  I feel it right now.
[02:34:48.720 --> 02:34:49.720]  I feel it right now.
[02:34:49.720 --> 02:34:50.720]  Can you feel it?
[02:34:50.720 --> 02:34:51.720]  I can feel it.
[02:34:51.720 --> 02:34:52.720]  Yep.
[02:34:52.720 --> 02:34:53.720]  He's here.
[02:34:53.720 --> 02:34:54.720]  And then why does the enemy hate that so much?
[02:34:54.720 --> 02:34:55.720]  Why don't I hit the name of Jesus?
[02:34:55.720 --> 02:34:57.720]  Because it's the power of Almighty God.
[02:34:57.720 --> 02:34:59.160]  That's why we want to have the comforter.
[02:34:59.160 --> 02:35:00.160]  And we're transceivers.
[02:35:00.160 --> 02:35:01.160]  We're bringing that in.
[02:35:01.160 --> 02:35:02.160]  It's free will.
[02:35:02.160 --> 02:35:06.160]  Because Satan forces his energy, but God only comes knocking, but we've got to open
[02:35:06.160 --> 02:35:07.160]  the door.
[02:35:07.160 --> 02:35:08.160]  Got to open the door.
[02:35:08.160 --> 02:35:09.160]  He is the door.
[02:35:09.160 --> 02:35:11.920]  So, so how often are you able to get in the quiet place the most time?
[02:35:11.920 --> 02:35:12.920]  I'm not enough.
[02:35:12.920 --> 02:35:14.880]  That's why I came to Texas so I can get away.
[02:35:14.880 --> 02:35:20.800]  And the most joyful times I have personally is when I'm out on a gator or on a tractor
[02:35:20.800 --> 02:35:21.800]  out in the wilderness.
[02:35:21.800 --> 02:35:22.800]  And you just zone out.
[02:35:22.800 --> 02:35:25.440]  I zone out and soak in his glory.
[02:35:25.440 --> 02:35:26.440]  That's where we got to reach him.
[02:35:26.440 --> 02:35:27.440]  We get so caught up.
[02:35:27.440 --> 02:35:28.440]  Satan wants us to be.
[02:35:28.440 --> 02:35:33.000]  You know, if you ever just stop the tractor and just go, oh, I mean, it's like every time
[02:35:33.000 --> 02:35:38.160]  I just start bawling and crying and just just feeling his presence and we talk about drugs
[02:35:38.160 --> 02:35:39.160]  and addiction.
[02:35:39.160 --> 02:35:40.160]  There's no drug.
[02:35:40.160 --> 02:35:41.160]  There's no drug.
[02:35:41.160 --> 02:35:42.160]  What is that?
[02:35:42.160 --> 02:35:43.800]  When the Holy Spirit floods you so strongly, you start crying.
[02:35:43.800 --> 02:35:45.440]  My wife, sometimes I'll just be sitting there and start crying.
[02:35:45.440 --> 02:35:46.440]  She was, what's going on?
[02:35:46.440 --> 02:35:47.440]  I feel God.
[02:35:47.440 --> 02:35:48.440]  I just, it's like...
[02:35:48.440 --> 02:35:49.440]  It's amazing.
[02:35:49.440 --> 02:35:50.440]  There's no...
[02:35:50.440 --> 02:35:53.320]  And the closer you get to the truth, the more you're pushed into that.
[02:35:53.320 --> 02:35:55.800]  It's like, you're just like, right now I feel it.
[02:35:55.800 --> 02:35:56.800]  Yeah.
[02:35:56.800 --> 02:36:00.880]  Can you imagine what heaven's going to be like when you can feel that it should kind
[02:36:00.880 --> 02:36:02.540]  of glory all the time?
[02:36:02.540 --> 02:36:03.540]  We get moments of that.
[02:36:03.540 --> 02:36:06.960]  And we can get that as much as we want if we get in tune to his spirit.
[02:36:06.960 --> 02:36:07.960]  We get...
[02:36:07.960 --> 02:36:08.960]  But we don't slow down and get...
[02:36:08.960 --> 02:36:12.080]  So, why does our body physiologically cry when we're in the presence of God?
[02:36:12.080 --> 02:36:15.960]  Because we're... he sees the condition of our heart.
[02:36:15.960 --> 02:36:16.960]  Your heart is open.
[02:36:16.960 --> 02:36:19.480]  You know who he is and you love him.
[02:36:19.480 --> 02:36:20.680]  It's not about a religion.
[02:36:20.680 --> 02:36:22.640]  It's about a love relationship in the heart.
[02:36:22.640 --> 02:36:23.640]  And that's what...
[02:36:23.640 --> 02:36:24.640]  You mentioned King David.
[02:36:24.640 --> 02:36:26.320]  That's why he's the apple of God's eye.
[02:36:26.320 --> 02:36:32.600]  Beloved is because he saw David's heart and David's heart loved him.
[02:36:32.600 --> 02:36:35.760]  And then the opposite of that is Satanist black heart.
[02:36:35.760 --> 02:36:36.760]  Exactly.
[02:36:36.760 --> 02:36:37.760]  It's black and white.
[02:36:37.760 --> 02:36:40.160]  That's why you can't be indifferent and be on the fence.
[02:36:40.160 --> 02:36:43.240]  Either all in or you're all out.
[02:36:43.240 --> 02:36:46.880]  And different is not what we need.
[02:36:46.880 --> 02:36:50.120]  We have to be all in.
[02:36:50.120 --> 02:36:54.720]  My issue is when I get in a quiet place the most time, I just want to be with God and
[02:36:54.720 --> 02:36:55.720]  I just...
[02:36:55.720 --> 02:36:57.120]  I don't want to say even feel sorry for the enemy.
[02:36:57.120 --> 02:36:58.560]  I just can't even believe they're doing it.
[02:36:58.560 --> 02:36:59.800]  I'm just like...
[02:36:59.800 --> 02:37:00.800]  I don't even...
[02:37:00.800 --> 02:37:01.800]  I'm like, what?
[02:37:01.800 --> 02:37:02.800]  Why would you not want this?
[02:37:02.800 --> 02:37:05.400]  There's nothing better.
[02:37:05.400 --> 02:37:08.440]  Why would you not want eternal peace and total completion?
[02:37:08.440 --> 02:37:12.120]  I don't understand how you wouldn't want this right now.
[02:37:12.120 --> 02:37:13.120]  You feel it right now.
[02:37:13.120 --> 02:37:14.120]  I feel it.
[02:37:14.120 --> 02:37:15.120]  Oh, yeah.
[02:37:15.120 --> 02:37:16.120]  Why would you not want that?
[02:37:16.120 --> 02:37:17.120]  He's here.
[02:37:17.120 --> 02:37:18.120]  What's wrong with them?
[02:37:18.120 --> 02:37:20.440]  They've been channeled by Satan.
[02:37:20.440 --> 02:37:23.320]  Satan does not want man to have a relationship with God.
[02:37:23.320 --> 02:37:26.640]  Once he was thrown out of heaven, that's when the war started.
[02:37:26.640 --> 02:37:31.000]  And it's the media and the culture and things that trick us out of that level that you feel
[02:37:31.000 --> 02:37:32.000]  yourself shift out of it.
[02:37:32.000 --> 02:37:35.760]  I catch it all the time, like literally being, I'll destroy that person, I'll have these evil
[02:37:35.760 --> 02:37:38.880]  thoughts, like, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[02:37:38.880 --> 02:37:41.120]  That's why we have to have a shalom in his peace.
[02:37:41.120 --> 02:37:44.920]  Through that peace, he wins, but we have to participate with him.
[02:37:44.920 --> 02:37:49.880]  And when you participate, there's no better joy in the world than riding the train with
[02:37:49.880 --> 02:37:50.880]  his glory.
[02:37:50.880 --> 02:37:53.840]  And the incredible thing is it isn't just that feeling of completion and peace.
[02:37:53.840 --> 02:37:54.840]  You're given discernment.
[02:37:54.840 --> 02:37:56.040]  Now, everything's clear.
[02:37:56.040 --> 02:37:57.040]  Absolutely.
[02:37:57.040 --> 02:38:00.560]  You supernaturally know things that you could never know.
[02:38:00.560 --> 02:38:01.560]  What's happening?
[02:38:01.560 --> 02:38:04.600]  I mean, we know we're electrochemical, we're receivers, transceivers.
[02:38:04.600 --> 02:38:07.920]  And worship, that's transmitting we receive.
[02:38:07.920 --> 02:38:08.920]  That's the Holy Spirit.
[02:38:08.920 --> 02:38:10.040]  What is that?
[02:38:10.040 --> 02:38:13.160]  That is his love shining down in us and through us.
[02:38:13.160 --> 02:38:16.160]  And the key word you just said, Alex, is worship.
[02:38:16.160 --> 02:38:20.400]  We do a lot of time praying to the Lord, but we don't worship him and just stop and say,
[02:38:20.400 --> 02:38:23.760]  thank you, Lord, for everything you've given me.
[02:38:23.760 --> 02:38:24.760]  And praise.
[02:38:24.760 --> 02:38:26.480]  Explain why that's so important and why God wants that.
[02:38:26.480 --> 02:38:27.480]  That's opening the channel.
[02:38:27.480 --> 02:38:28.880]  It's opening the channel for him.
[02:38:28.880 --> 02:38:30.960]  It's opening your heart to his heart.
[02:38:30.960 --> 02:38:35.640]  And the worship just got flooded out, he's intense again right now, just by talking about
[02:38:35.640 --> 02:38:36.640]  it.
[02:38:36.640 --> 02:38:37.640]  It's worship.
[02:38:37.640 --> 02:38:38.840]  Worship him.
[02:38:38.840 --> 02:38:40.800]  Because God doesn't force free will.
[02:38:40.800 --> 02:38:43.160]  God's waiting, but only when the channel opens.
[02:38:43.160 --> 02:38:44.160]  Right.
[02:38:44.160 --> 02:38:45.160]  When we take action.
[02:38:45.160 --> 02:38:46.160]  We have to.
[02:38:46.160 --> 02:38:48.160]  And I found getting around real believers like you, that's why they don't want us in
[02:38:48.160 --> 02:38:50.560]  a church, that magnifies it.
[02:38:50.560 --> 02:38:51.560]  It does.
[02:38:51.560 --> 02:38:55.440]  Can you imagine if you get millions of people in this remnant, just like this, with the
[02:38:55.440 --> 02:38:57.960]  spirit of the Lord going, nothing can stop us.
[02:38:57.960 --> 02:39:01.160]  That's why Satan is so afraid of the remnant.
[02:39:01.160 --> 02:39:05.760]  That's why the first thing they said is the porn shops and liquor stores and wallmarks
[02:39:05.760 --> 02:39:11.120]  open and targets open, but churches are closed because that, that is just a path.
[02:39:11.120 --> 02:39:13.560]  Those real churches that are out there, it's so powerful.
[02:39:13.560 --> 02:39:15.240]  They know the power of the Lord.
[02:39:15.240 --> 02:39:17.840]  And that's the first thing they try to target and what did the church do?
[02:39:17.840 --> 02:39:18.840]  Shut down.
[02:39:18.840 --> 02:39:19.840]  It's time for the church to rise.
[02:39:19.840 --> 02:39:21.920]  The true church, the church of Christ.
[02:39:21.920 --> 02:39:28.880]  So what is a spiritual exercise for people that have never experienced the Holy Spirit,
[02:39:28.880 --> 02:39:34.360]  that lead us in prayer in the few minutes we have left or, or, or, or a, a short sermon
[02:39:34.360 --> 02:39:37.320]  about how do people have never experienced this next level?
[02:39:37.320 --> 02:39:39.320]  How do they open the channel to God?
[02:39:39.320 --> 02:39:43.120]  What you need to do is a lot of people think that there's this advanced formula because
[02:39:43.120 --> 02:39:48.720]  we've been taught in religion is this, this complex, I even heard one pastor say Christianity
[02:39:48.720 --> 02:39:50.280]  is a thinking man's religion.
[02:39:50.280 --> 02:39:52.080]  That's the furthest thing from the truth.
[02:39:52.080 --> 02:39:55.600]  It's a love relationship and you talk to him like a loving father bride and groom bride
[02:39:55.600 --> 02:39:56.600]  and groom.
[02:39:56.600 --> 02:39:59.520]  You love him and you don't need to have a fancy prayer to him.
[02:39:59.520 --> 02:40:00.520]  He knows your heart.
[02:40:00.520 --> 02:40:04.680]  He knows what you're going to ask before you ask it, but ask them, just say, Lord, come
[02:40:04.680 --> 02:40:10.560]  down into me, show me your kingdom, glory, walk in my ways, show me the path, give me
[02:40:10.560 --> 02:40:15.680]  wisdom and discernment and then just listen and meditate on him and let him talk back
[02:40:15.680 --> 02:40:19.160]  to you and you feel the spirit of the Lord and you got to keep exercising.
[02:40:19.160 --> 02:40:20.220]  It's like a muscle.
[02:40:20.220 --> 02:40:25.800]  The more we get into that with him, the more he gets into us and it grows and grows and
[02:40:25.800 --> 02:40:29.240]  grows and when you have it, you don't want to quit.
[02:40:29.240 --> 02:40:33.440]  And that gives us the perseverance to when we're in a battle, we're not going to quit
[02:40:33.440 --> 02:40:35.040]  because we know he's already won.
[02:40:35.040 --> 02:40:37.480]  Well, I'm under a lot of stress and enemy attack.
[02:40:37.480 --> 02:40:38.480]  I've learned this turn.
[02:40:38.480 --> 02:40:39.480]  Let's say God, I can't do it.
[02:40:39.480 --> 02:40:40.480]  I need you to help me.
[02:40:40.480 --> 02:40:44.080]  And it's like instantly and all these answers come.
[02:40:44.080 --> 02:40:47.680]  It's like you're jacking into the eternity into God.
[02:40:47.680 --> 02:40:49.600]  Yep, you hit the nail on the head.
[02:40:49.600 --> 02:40:55.040]  You said, I, we as individuals can't do it, but he can and we need to ask him to come
[02:40:55.040 --> 02:40:58.880]  in and direct our paths and as soon as we do that, supernatural, he's going to open
[02:40:58.880 --> 02:41:02.200]  up ways that we got a minute and a half left to be on the first hour of the war and lead
[02:41:02.200 --> 02:41:05.960]  us in a one minute prayer about how you lead got my dad always said prayers that are held
[02:41:05.960 --> 02:41:07.320]  about God, please.
[02:41:07.320 --> 02:41:08.560]  We know we're failed and flawed.
[02:41:08.560 --> 02:41:11.600]  We love Jesus, your son, we got to direct us come into us.
[02:41:11.600 --> 02:41:12.600]  What would you say to people?
[02:41:12.600 --> 02:41:16.760]  I say anybody out there that hasn't accepted the Lord and their savior, Jesus Christ or
[02:41:16.760 --> 02:41:19.640]  think they have, there are many people in our church today that there's think they're
[02:41:19.640 --> 02:41:22.680]  saved, but they're not because you don't have that personal relationship with them.
[02:41:22.680 --> 02:41:26.880]  You just have some very simple Lord Jesus Christ come into my heart on a center, a fallen
[02:41:26.880 --> 02:41:29.880]  short of the glory of God and I can't do it on my own.
[02:41:29.880 --> 02:41:30.880]  I need you.
[02:41:30.880 --> 02:41:31.960]  I need you in me.
[02:41:31.960 --> 02:41:33.160]  I need you to guide me.
[02:41:33.160 --> 02:41:37.160]  I need you to give me the blueprint because your word is the blueprint.
[02:41:37.160 --> 02:41:41.600]  Help me keep that shalom and that peace and that focus on you and not the world.
[02:41:41.600 --> 02:41:44.640]  Don't let Satan make me go to the left or go to the right.
[02:41:44.640 --> 02:41:46.360]  I stay straight on you.
[02:41:46.360 --> 02:41:48.520]  Can we ask anybody that's prayed that in Jesus' name?
[02:41:48.520 --> 02:41:52.600]  If you haven't accepted the Lord Jesus Christ as your Lord and savior, now's the time.
[02:41:52.600 --> 02:41:55.800]  Satan's favorite day of the week is tomorrow because tomorrow is never given.
[02:41:55.800 --> 02:41:56.800]  Jesus come into my heart.
[02:41:56.800 --> 02:41:57.800]  I'm a sinner.
[02:41:57.800 --> 02:42:02.720]  Forgive me of my sins and I want you to be the commander in chief in my life.
[02:42:02.720 --> 02:42:06.280]  If you prayed that and you meant that in your heart, you just entered into eternal life
[02:42:06.280 --> 02:42:07.280]  with him.
[02:42:07.280 --> 02:42:08.400]  Now the walk begins.
[02:42:08.400 --> 02:42:12.660]  Now you need to take action, get in his word and ask the Holy Spirit to come down as the
[02:42:12.660 --> 02:42:18.040]  comforter in you and I want listeners to know who have not understood this and had a fake
[02:42:18.040 --> 02:42:20.680]  religion or corrupt priest or whatever.
[02:42:20.680 --> 02:42:21.920]  This is so real folks.
[02:42:21.920 --> 02:42:23.080]  God's waiting.
[02:42:23.080 --> 02:42:25.800]  God knows the problems, but God's a free will God.
[02:42:25.800 --> 02:42:26.800]  He gave you free will.
[02:42:26.800 --> 02:42:28.080]  You've got to say, help me.
[02:42:28.080 --> 02:42:29.080]  I need you.
[02:42:29.080 --> 02:42:30.080]  I love you.
[02:42:30.080 --> 02:42:31.080]  Come into me.
[02:42:31.080 --> 02:42:32.080]  Show me.
[02:42:32.080 --> 02:42:33.080]  It's going to happen.
[02:42:33.080 --> 02:42:34.080]  It's going to happen.
[02:42:34.080 --> 02:42:35.080]  There's no doubt about it.
[02:42:35.080 --> 02:42:36.080]  He just wants us our hand.
[02:42:36.080 --> 02:42:37.080]  You grab our hand and then you get the shalom.
[02:42:37.080 --> 02:42:38.080]  Pastor, thank you so much.
[02:42:38.080 --> 02:42:39.080]  We love you.
[02:42:39.080 --> 02:42:40.080]  You're on the war room.
[02:42:40.080 --> 02:42:41.080]  The first hour coming up.
[02:42:41.080 --> 02:42:44.760]  We've got special guests coming up, a big report and promo videos coming up.
[02:42:44.760 --> 02:42:46.360]  I'll be on Piers Morgan next hour.
[02:42:46.360 --> 02:42:47.920]  There's going to be fireworks from that.
[02:42:47.920 --> 02:42:49.600]  We'll be covering it tomorrow on the show as well.
[02:42:49.600 --> 02:42:50.600]  God bless you all.
[02:42:50.600 --> 02:42:52.080]  Pastor, thank you so much.
[02:42:52.080 --> 02:42:59.040]  Dave Scarlett, people should check it out at HisGloryTV.
[02:42:59.040 --> 02:43:03.480]  Everyone watching should realize that this is an information war and it takes money to
[02:43:03.480 --> 02:43:05.000]  fund an information war.
[02:43:05.000 --> 02:43:09.520]  And everyone should decide to take the fight to the next level and to take the fight to
[02:43:09.520 --> 02:43:13.560]  the very tip of the spear and ensure we stand the field in this war against the New World
[02:43:13.560 --> 02:43:17.800]  Order by visiting infowarstore.com right now and taking action.
[02:43:17.800 --> 02:43:21.600]  I thank you for your past support and I ask you now to count the cost and realize that
[02:43:21.600 --> 02:43:26.320]  only your commitment to keep info wars on the air will ensure our victory against the
[02:43:26.320 --> 02:43:27.320]  New World Order.
[02:43:27.320 --> 02:43:28.760]  They're coming for you and your family.
[02:43:28.760 --> 02:43:29.760]  They're coming for me.
[02:43:29.760 --> 02:43:31.240]  They're coming for the children.
[02:43:31.240 --> 02:43:33.840]  But to get to the children, they've got to get through us first.
[02:43:33.840 --> 02:43:37.080]  These monsters are all over television wanting to give these shots to newborn babies.
[02:43:37.080 --> 02:43:38.720]  They're already given to the pregnant women.
[02:43:38.720 --> 02:43:40.440]  Miscarriages are off the chart.
[02:43:40.440 --> 02:43:44.920]  80 plus percent increase in miscarriages in the first two prime ministers after these
[02:43:44.920 --> 02:43:46.200]  poison shots.
[02:43:46.200 --> 02:43:50.200]  We can and will save the children and they are counting on us.
[02:43:50.200 --> 02:43:51.360]  Let's do it together.
[02:43:51.360 --> 02:43:55.840]  And the fight starts at infowars.com and the fight continues with your financial support
[02:43:55.840 --> 02:43:57.400]  at infowarstore.com.
[02:43:57.400 --> 02:43:58.600]  Now take action now.
[02:43:58.600 --> 02:44:04.080]  I'm Dr. Peter McCullough and it's an absolute pleasure to introduce to you the Wellness
[02:44:04.080 --> 02:44:11.000]  Company, an alternative healthcare system for this COVID and post COVID world where
[02:44:11.000 --> 02:44:16.520]  trust has been lost in doctors and healthcare systems.
[02:44:16.520 --> 02:44:25.640]  This new online virtual platform is nationwide providing uncensored content, virtual appointments,
[02:44:25.640 --> 02:44:33.720]  laboratory testing, diagnostics, prescriptions, treatment packages specifically for COVID
[02:44:33.720 --> 02:44:39.640]  post COVID, vaccine injury syndromes and all the usual things that are seen in primary
[02:44:39.640 --> 02:44:41.440]  care.
[02:44:41.440 --> 02:44:48.400]  And then we have an entire array of holistic products, an online store, media and health
[02:44:48.400 --> 02:44:49.640]  advice.
[02:44:49.640 --> 02:44:57.120]  Come see the Wellness Company and go to onlinehealthnow.com as a conduit to the Wellness
[02:44:57.120 --> 02:45:26.120]  Company.
[02:45:26.120 --> 02:45:35.760]  Introducing infowars.md at infowarsstore.com, infowars.md exclusively at infowarsstore.com
[02:45:35.760 --> 02:45:43.320]  has 10 new products, turmeric 95, libido rx, better mood, nitric boost, much room max,
[02:45:43.320 --> 02:45:48.040]  and atropin, angels fatality collagen, superfood greens and more.
[02:45:48.040 --> 02:45:49.600]  Just taking superfood greens.
[02:45:49.600 --> 02:45:54.160]  This is the highest quality greens out there and it's at a price way, way lower than the
[02:45:54.160 --> 02:45:57.120]  same product on store shelves for twice the cost.
[02:45:57.120 --> 02:45:58.880]  Find infowarsmd at infowarsstore.
[02:45:58.880 --> 02:46:01.080]  There is a war on for your mind.
[02:46:01.080 --> 02:46:02.840]  Your mind is a battlefield.
[02:46:02.840 --> 02:46:05.080]  This is an information war.
[02:46:05.080 --> 02:46:10.840]  Infowars popularized those terms more than two decades ago and today, whether it's Donald
[02:46:10.840 --> 02:46:17.600]  Trump or Governor DeSantis or Dr. Robert Malone, they're all using the terms that infowars
[02:46:17.600 --> 02:46:21.800]  has popularized because we understand the enemy's operations and we know how to beat
[02:46:21.800 --> 02:46:26.360]  them, but we can't do it without funding and we make it easy to fund with great products
[02:46:26.360 --> 02:46:29.360]  and power you and your immune system and your family as well.
[02:46:29.360 --> 02:46:34.080]  You can also make straight donations at infowarsstore.com, clicking on the big red banner, a one time
[02:46:34.080 --> 02:46:36.880]  or recurring, but I'm asking you to take action.
[02:46:36.880 --> 02:46:40.320]  We're nonviolent, but every time you donate money, every time you buy products, every
[02:46:40.320 --> 02:46:44.160]  time you keep us on air, you are literally nonviolently politically punching the new
[02:46:44.160 --> 02:46:48.280]  world order in the nose, punching their lies in the nose.
[02:46:48.280 --> 02:46:50.160]  We are going to defeat the new world order.
[02:46:50.160 --> 02:46:54.880]  We're going over the top, but right now is the critical juncture, so please go to infowarsstore.com
[02:46:54.880 --> 02:47:00.280]  and donate now.
[02:47:00.280 --> 02:47:27.760]  Thank you.
[02:47:30.280 --> 02:47:39.560]  Out here in the dark, you can't tell where you are.
[02:47:39.560 --> 02:47:45.720]  You're not able to ascertain the terrain around you, but as you begin to add more light to
[02:47:45.720 --> 02:47:55.200]  the situation, the details come into focus and you begin to become aware of your surroundings.
[02:47:55.200 --> 02:48:00.960]  Light is commonly used as an art type or a metaphor for the truth, and with the surveillance
[02:48:00.960 --> 02:48:05.720]  of the censorship of intelligence agencies working with legacy media and big tech, they
[02:48:05.720 --> 02:48:09.800]  have attempted to suppress the light in the last three years while they launched their
[02:48:09.800 --> 02:48:10.800]  great reset agenda.
[02:48:10.800 --> 02:48:14.880]  But because of independent journalists and citizens and scientists and doctors coming
[02:48:14.880 --> 02:48:19.200]  out and blowing the whistle, the globalist attempt to suppress us and keep us in darkness
[02:48:19.200 --> 02:48:23.280]  has completely failed, and now that the full horror of what we've all gone through, starting
[02:48:23.280 --> 02:48:29.360]  to come into crisp focus, we realize that we are all in grave danger, we're all standing
[02:48:29.360 --> 02:48:36.480]  on the edge of a cliff, and as we begin to research even more and as more light floods
[02:48:36.480 --> 02:48:42.440]  the zone, we realize that many of us have been pushed off that cliff to their deaths
[02:48:42.440 --> 02:48:47.800]  in many cases, and interdibilitating illnesses, sterility, heart attack, heart attack, blood
[02:48:47.800 --> 02:48:54.240]  clots, and so many other terrible adversities that we now know the CDC was aware of before
[02:48:54.240 --> 02:49:00.560]  the poison shots were even rolled out in October of 2000.
[02:49:00.560 --> 02:49:04.160]  Why would they admit in their own documents they were conscious of this program?
[02:49:04.160 --> 02:49:06.160]  There's a lot of reasons for that.
[02:49:06.160 --> 02:49:10.920]  We'll be discussing them in the days and weeks and months to come, but know this, a
[02:49:10.920 --> 02:49:16.920]  reckoning isn't coming, it's already here, and Klaus Schwab and Bill Gates and Fauci
[02:49:16.920 --> 02:49:22.880]  and the rest of his criminal eugenics depopulation cult, like Paul Ehrlich and others, must be
[02:49:22.880 --> 02:49:28.480]  brought to justice, because they're already planning new attacks, they've already scripted
[02:49:28.480 --> 02:49:34.480]  the next bio-weapon release, and they've already cast themselves as the heroes.
[02:49:34.480 --> 02:49:43.480]  At many levels, cities are amazing things, part of the most incredible selection of food
[02:49:43.480 --> 02:49:50.400]  claimants, and the globalists at the United Nations constantly brag that the mega cities
[02:49:50.400 --> 02:49:55.400]  of the future, Austin being one of them, will be the control grids that take over all the
[02:49:55.400 --> 02:50:01.680]  countryside and rural areas, and will be used to train people to live in a high-tech technocracy
[02:50:01.680 --> 02:50:06.920]  that makes the current communist Chinese social credit score look tame in comparison.
[02:50:06.920 --> 02:50:10.280]  That's why in this revolution, we've got to not just have the information, we've not
[02:50:10.280 --> 02:50:14.960]  just got to keep our immune systems up, we've got to warn others about the new world order,
[02:50:14.960 --> 02:50:20.600]  and all of us need to work with friends and family to get pieces of rural property and
[02:50:20.600 --> 02:50:25.720]  get back to the land, even if it's only part-time, to learn how to become self-sufficient, because
[02:50:25.720 --> 02:50:29.640]  in the future, you're going to watch those under the control of the globalist and the
[02:50:29.640 --> 02:50:35.320]  social credit score, you're going to watch those who are caught in the trap of the universal
[02:50:35.320 --> 02:50:40.200]  basic income, being forced to take injections, being forced to be sterilized, being forced
[02:50:40.200 --> 02:50:45.880]  in many cases to even be part of government-sponsored euthanasia, Canada is the model.
[02:50:45.880 --> 02:50:49.560]  This is a control grid, this is a vice they're putting us in.
[02:50:49.560 --> 02:50:53.360]  Everybody should go online and find my film, it's free, in-game, Blueprint for Global
[02:50:53.360 --> 02:50:58.120]  Enslavement, made in 2007, with all their documents predicting what would be here by
[02:50:58.120 --> 02:51:06.320]  the year 2023, and it's already here because it's their battle plan, it's their program.
[02:51:06.320 --> 02:51:13.280]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[02:51:13.280 --> 02:51:19.120]  Once free nations are slaves to the will of a tiny elite, the dawn of a new dark age
[02:51:19.120 --> 02:51:22.400]  is upon mankind.
[02:51:22.400 --> 02:51:28.280]  Cities are a thing of the past, every form of independence is under attack, with the
[02:51:28.280 --> 02:51:33.880]  family and even the individual itself nearing extinction.
[02:51:33.880 --> 02:51:38.680]  Close to 80% of the Earth's population has been eliminated.
[02:51:38.680 --> 02:51:44.600]  The remnants of a once free humanity are forced to live within highly controlled, compact,
[02:51:44.600 --> 02:51:47.640]  risen-like cities.
[02:51:47.640 --> 02:51:50.280]  Travel is highly restricted.
[02:51:50.280 --> 02:51:55.400]  Other highways connect the megacities and keep the population from entering into unauthorized
[02:51:55.400 --> 02:51:57.400]  zones.
[02:51:57.400 --> 02:52:00.000]  No human activity is private.
[02:52:00.000 --> 02:52:04.560]  AI supercomputers chronicle and categorize every action.
[02:52:04.560 --> 02:52:10.520]  A prison planet dominated by a ruthless gang of control freaks whose power can never be
[02:52:10.520 --> 02:52:11.520]  challenged.
[02:52:11.520 --> 02:52:16.120]  This is the vision of the global elite, their goal.
[02:52:16.120 --> 02:52:20.400]  The bad news is these people mean business and are mass murdering mad scientists.
[02:52:20.400 --> 02:52:24.520]  The good news is we have their blueprint, we have the Death Star plans and we know how
[02:52:24.520 --> 02:52:25.960]  to bring them down.
[02:52:25.960 --> 02:52:29.120]  That city is a UN controlled stronghold.
[02:52:29.120 --> 02:52:34.440]  That is a test grid for the systems they're putting in, not just the 5G, but the surveillance,
[02:52:34.440 --> 02:52:39.160]  the tracker chips of all the cars, the fuel switches, the robots, the drones, all of it
[02:52:39.160 --> 02:52:40.360]  is being admitted.
[02:52:40.360 --> 02:52:44.520]  The globalists are taking control of the evolutionary process of humanity.
[02:52:44.520 --> 02:52:50.400]  They're playing God at treating us like Benjamin Netanyahu said a month ago on Jordan Peters'
[02:52:50.400 --> 02:52:52.400]  show as lab rats.
[02:52:52.400 --> 02:52:57.800]  He said the entire Israeli population are lab rats, not just for their COVID injections,
[02:52:57.800 --> 02:53:00.600]  but for future tests of mRNA.
[02:53:00.600 --> 02:53:06.560]  So Israel became, if you will, the lab for Pfizer and that's how we did it.
[02:53:06.560 --> 02:53:10.240]  We got out that we gave the information to the world and now it's been published in medical
[02:53:10.240 --> 02:53:11.360]  magazines and so on.
[02:53:11.360 --> 02:53:18.960]  I intend to bring on that base, database of personal medical records for our entire population,
[02:53:18.960 --> 02:53:21.640]  a genetic database, genomes, okay?
[02:53:21.640 --> 02:53:30.600]  Now let pharma companies, let medical companies, let them run algorithms on this database, okay?
[02:53:30.600 --> 02:53:38.640]  You can create a biotechnological industry that is unheard of right now, unheard of,
[02:53:38.640 --> 02:53:40.280]  unimagined even.
[02:53:40.280 --> 02:53:41.400]  Think about that.
[02:53:41.400 --> 02:53:42.680]  That's what Israel's become.
[02:53:42.680 --> 02:53:43.680]  That's what Singapore's become.
[02:53:43.680 --> 02:53:45.240]  That's what the UK's become.
[02:53:45.240 --> 02:53:46.400]  That's what Germany's become.
[02:53:46.400 --> 02:53:51.480]  That's what China is the model of, ladies and gentlemen, and we have to come together
[02:53:51.480 --> 02:53:56.240]  and realize this and not let them continue to push humanity over the edge of the cliff.
[02:53:56.240 --> 02:53:59.720]  Info wars is the very front line of this fight, the very tip of the spear.
[02:53:59.720 --> 02:54:03.720]  And I salute the thing of your past support, but now more than ever realize we need your
[02:54:03.720 --> 02:54:05.480]  support in your word of mouth.
[02:54:05.480 --> 02:54:07.320]  The public is ready to hear the truth.
[02:54:07.320 --> 02:54:10.200]  We've won major battles, but the war has not been won yet.
[02:54:10.200 --> 02:54:13.840]  Just spread the word about the broadcast and go to infowarstore.com and buy great products
[02:54:13.840 --> 02:54:17.920]  today that boost your immune system and empower your life while also keeping info wars on
[02:54:17.920 --> 02:54:20.040]  the air a true 360 win.
[02:54:20.040 --> 02:54:25.240]  Like a rock thrown into a pond, your actions, you know they may seem little, have a massive
[02:54:25.240 --> 02:54:27.600]  ripple effect throughout time and space.
[02:54:27.600 --> 02:54:29.240]  We're actually winning the info war.
[02:54:29.240 --> 02:54:34.040]  And when you realize that Band-Aut Video has hundreds and hundreds of censored directors
[02:54:34.040 --> 02:54:39.640]  and investigative journalists and talk show hosts whose information is beyond incredible.
[02:54:39.640 --> 02:54:43.880]  Hundreds of medical doctors and scientists, all of them right now telling the truth at
[02:54:43.880 --> 02:54:49.480]  Band-Aut Video, millions of people a day visiting Band-Aut Video, but you can take that information
[02:54:49.480 --> 02:54:54.440]  and cause a bigger ripple effect, an amplifying effect and make sure it gets out to your friends,
[02:54:54.440 --> 02:54:57.280]  your family, your neighbors and perfect strangers.
[02:54:57.280 --> 02:54:59.840]  You are the modern Paul Revere's.
[02:54:59.840 --> 02:55:03.000]  You are what takes our information and amplifies it.
[02:55:03.000 --> 02:55:08.200]  When you decide to take action, we as a species and as a race are invincible.
[02:55:08.200 --> 02:55:13.160]  So I thank you all for your past action and I challenge you to redouble your efforts now
[02:55:13.160 --> 02:55:21.240]  because humanity and the children are counting on you.
[02:55:21.240 --> 02:55:24.960]  Humanity is in a very dangerous position right now.
[02:55:24.960 --> 02:55:29.520]  Powerful corporations using military grade psychological warfare programs are rolling
[02:55:29.520 --> 02:55:36.520]  out a biomedical tyranny worldwide, a world ID, a cashless society, a social credit school,
[02:55:36.520 --> 02:55:43.080]  a universal basic income where every facet of your life is tracked, surveilled and controlled.
[02:55:43.080 --> 02:55:47.600]  If you think the censorship and surveillance you've seen so far about the deep state and
[02:55:47.600 --> 02:55:53.560]  big tech was bad, that is just the opening salvo of their attack.
[02:55:53.560 --> 02:55:57.560]  Humanity and all of our hard fought liberties and freedoms and all of our safeguards are
[02:55:57.560 --> 02:56:00.560]  literally on the edge of a cliff.
[02:56:00.560 --> 02:56:07.280]  But without info wars on the air, the general public is not going to be aware of the enemy
[02:56:07.280 --> 02:56:08.280]  operations.
[02:56:08.280 --> 02:56:14.560]  We didn't just tell you about this whole poison shot rollout first three years ago on record.
[02:56:14.560 --> 02:56:16.920]  We're also telling you what's coming next.
[02:56:16.920 --> 02:56:17.920]  We track the enemy.
[02:56:17.920 --> 02:56:22.960]  They're preparing new bioweapon releases and new poison mRNA franken shots.
[02:56:22.960 --> 02:56:28.680]  Ladies and gentlemen, my family, your family, is at the edge of a cliff.
[02:56:28.680 --> 02:56:34.560]  Bill Gates, Klaus Schwab, the UN, the WHO is literally pushing us over into that cashless
[02:56:34.560 --> 02:56:38.960]  society, Elgren, into that biomedical tyranny that will be even worse than what you see
[02:56:38.960 --> 02:56:42.560]  in communist China, that is the current main laboratory of this control.
[02:56:42.560 --> 02:56:46.960]  We have to first recognize there is a cliff, we have to recognize that millions of people
[02:56:46.960 --> 02:56:50.760]  have been forced into these deadly shots and pushed over the cliff and died, tens of millions
[02:56:50.760 --> 02:56:55.360]  more are sick and dying from these poison shots.
[02:56:55.360 --> 02:56:59.240]  Every one of you watching knows someone who took the shot and died or who became deathly
[02:56:59.240 --> 02:57:03.640]  ill and their own documents show they know this is deadly and what do they do?
[02:57:03.640 --> 02:57:07.520]  They push and push and push and say, well, it's up to you, but we'll take your rights
[02:57:07.520 --> 02:57:09.680]  and freedoms away if you don't take it.
[02:57:09.680 --> 02:57:13.720]  Stand up to the tyrants and think they own your body, but they own my body and spread
[02:57:13.720 --> 02:57:18.200]  the word and share the articles and videos like your life depends on it from info wars.com
[02:57:18.200 --> 02:57:21.040]  because it does.
[02:57:21.040 --> 02:57:27.600]  Mark Twain, one of America's greatest writers and satirist in Mines, famously said more
[02:57:27.600 --> 02:57:34.160]  than 150 years ago, rumors of his demise had been greatly exaggerated because the newspapers
[02:57:34.160 --> 02:57:40.040]  kept saying he died decades before he did die and it's the same si-op today.
[02:57:40.040 --> 02:57:44.360]  Info wars is more influential and more powerful than ever because of your support and because
[02:57:44.360 --> 02:57:51.360]  of the facts of what we've covered, it's coming true.
[02:58:44.360 --> 02:58:53.280]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are now launching the most powerful supplements in the history
[02:58:53.280 --> 02:58:58.400]  of info wars under a new brand name info wars platinum.
[02:58:58.400 --> 02:59:03.120]  Now all three of these revolutionary products you see in front of you are already number
[02:59:03.120 --> 02:59:08.160]  one best sellers in the market for the last few years because they work so well.
[02:59:08.160 --> 02:59:12.440]  We've gone right to the manufacturer who are listeners, the owners of fan and they've given
[02:59:12.440 --> 02:59:20.160]  us this huge deal off of retail, 40% off what these products are found for under other names.
[02:59:20.160 --> 02:59:25.000]  And not just under one name, they sell these under three or four other brands that other
[02:59:25.000 --> 02:59:27.200]  major distributors and suppliers have put out.
[02:59:27.200 --> 02:59:31.760]  The difference is we have it for 40% off what it is in stores.
[02:59:31.760 --> 02:59:33.640]  We're talking about pain MD.
[02:59:33.640 --> 02:59:36.320]  We're talking about HGH max boost.
[02:59:36.320 --> 02:59:39.200]  We're talking about 1776 testosterone boost.
[02:59:39.200 --> 02:59:40.800]  These things are incredible.
[02:59:40.800 --> 02:59:44.880]  I would suggest you take half a dose or less when you first do and consult your healthcare
[02:59:44.880 --> 02:59:45.880]  provider.
[02:59:45.880 --> 02:59:46.880]  Those are so powerful.
[02:59:46.880 --> 02:59:48.120]  Get them at infowarstore.com.
[02:59:48.120 --> 03:00:07.120]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:00:07.120 --> 03:00:11.960]  Wow, Kelvin, we are hosting the Alex Jones fourth hour.
[03:00:11.960 --> 03:00:14.480]  What an honour and a privilege here in New Zealand.
[03:00:14.480 --> 03:00:15.480]  What is the date?
[03:00:15.480 --> 03:00:19.680]  The date here in New Zealand, because we are your future, is the 13th of November.
[03:00:19.680 --> 03:00:23.800]  13th of January, Friday the 13th.
[03:00:23.800 --> 03:00:30.080]  Yes, and it is a great honour to be here from New Zealand.
[03:00:30.080 --> 03:00:31.080]  We're filling in.
[03:00:31.080 --> 03:00:33.200]  This is our first show back for 2023.
[03:00:33.200 --> 03:00:34.400]  It's been a massive year.
[03:00:34.400 --> 03:00:38.880]  So what we thought we'd get into today is just basically giving you guys a bit of an
[03:00:38.880 --> 03:00:41.160]  outline about what's happening here in New Zealand.
[03:00:41.160 --> 03:00:42.320]  It's crazy.
[03:00:42.320 --> 03:00:47.040]  Like the rest of the world, this globalist agenda is not stopping one bit.
[03:00:47.040 --> 03:00:52.120]  We will be bringing you an update on the baby will story that did go viral in December last
[03:00:52.120 --> 03:00:53.120]  year.
[03:00:53.120 --> 03:00:55.520]  We hosted the Trusathon as well for that.
[03:00:55.520 --> 03:00:59.840]  We've got some stuff about Jacinda that we want to talk about.
[03:00:59.840 --> 03:01:05.200]  Of course, we want to do a bit of a reflection, Calvin, of 2023 or 2022.
[03:01:05.200 --> 03:01:09.360]  And what a year that was and when we are very happy to forget.
[03:01:09.360 --> 03:01:10.360]  Absolutely.
[03:01:10.360 --> 03:01:14.080]  But some great things happened from our point of view here at Counterspin.
[03:01:14.080 --> 03:01:15.080]  And there you go.
[03:01:15.080 --> 03:01:17.560]  You see Jacinda Ardern with William, Prince William there.
[03:01:17.560 --> 03:01:22.320]  She's very much part of this global agenda, the World Economic Forum.
[03:01:22.320 --> 03:01:24.720]  She was also with Klaus Schwab.
[03:01:24.720 --> 03:01:26.420]  She was a global young leader.
[03:01:26.420 --> 03:01:31.760]  Many of you know that she is, she's really rolling out this agenda here in New Zealand
[03:01:31.760 --> 03:01:35.640]  and it's just absolutely shocking what's going on.
[03:01:35.640 --> 03:01:39.920]  We wanted to play you a little clip as well before we get going of Dr. McCullough where
[03:01:39.920 --> 03:01:45.920]  he actually names Jacinda Ardern and a number of other people who are at the head of this
[03:01:45.920 --> 03:01:48.520]  rollout with COVID and all the vaccines.
[03:01:48.520 --> 03:01:50.680]  But let's name some names when we say they.
[03:01:50.680 --> 03:01:52.520]  I think it's fair to say this.
[03:01:52.520 --> 03:01:55.640]  So let me throw out a name and you tell me if they're in or out.
[03:01:55.640 --> 03:01:57.360]  How about Klaus Schwab?
[03:01:57.360 --> 03:02:02.560]  Nobody will be safe if not everybody is vaccinated.
[03:02:02.560 --> 03:02:04.400]  Klaus Schwab in.
[03:02:04.400 --> 03:02:05.400]  Bill Gates.
[03:02:05.400 --> 03:02:13.360]  Normalcy only returns when we've largely vaccinated the entire global population.
[03:02:13.360 --> 03:02:19.200]  The fatality rate, you know, we didn't understand that it's a fairly low fatality rate and that
[03:02:19.200 --> 03:02:24.280]  it's a disease mainly of the elderly kind of like fluids, although a bit different than
[03:02:24.280 --> 03:02:25.280]  that.
[03:02:25.280 --> 03:02:29.800]  Jacinda Ardern, Prime Minister of New Zealand.
[03:02:29.800 --> 03:02:33.720]  Frankly, conspiracy theories.
[03:02:33.720 --> 03:02:34.720]  Justin Trudeau, Canada.
[03:02:34.720 --> 03:02:40.000]  Let people fall prey to disinformation and if conservative MPs and others want to start
[03:02:40.000 --> 03:02:46.600]  talking about conspiracy theories, well, that's their choice.
[03:02:46.600 --> 03:02:47.600]  President Biden.
[03:02:47.600 --> 03:02:48.600]  We say that again.
[03:02:48.600 --> 03:02:51.120]  It's a pandemic of the unvaccinated.
[03:02:51.120 --> 03:02:52.120]  In.
[03:02:52.120 --> 03:02:53.120]  Ashish Ja.
[03:02:53.120 --> 03:02:55.120]  I don't know that name.
[03:02:55.120 --> 03:02:58.280]  He's the current White House coronavirus coordinator.
[03:02:58.280 --> 03:02:59.280]  Don't wait.
[03:02:59.280 --> 03:03:00.360]  Get your COVID shot.
[03:03:00.360 --> 03:03:01.360]  Get your flu shot.
[03:03:01.360 --> 03:03:04.840]  That's why God gave you two arms and one in each arm if you want.
[03:03:04.840 --> 03:03:05.840]  In.
[03:03:05.840 --> 03:03:07.480]  Anthony Fauci.
[03:03:07.480 --> 03:03:13.520]  So maybe it doesn't work and they're simply not telling you that.
[03:03:13.520 --> 03:03:16.400]  That's just the typical crazy conspiracy theory.
[03:03:16.400 --> 03:03:17.400]  In.
[03:03:17.400 --> 03:03:19.960]  Robert Califf, head of the FDA.
[03:03:19.960 --> 03:03:25.840]  Right now, the U.S. is a place where there's a lot of work to do to figure out what's happened
[03:03:25.840 --> 03:03:27.040]  recently.
[03:03:27.040 --> 03:03:30.960]  So tech savvy and yet life expectancy going backwards.
[03:03:30.960 --> 03:03:31.960]  In.
[03:03:31.960 --> 03:03:37.000]  How about Peter Marks, FDA vaccine advisory committee.
[03:03:37.000 --> 03:03:42.600]  There is a lot of misinformation about the new COVID-19 bivalent vaccines and this misinformation
[03:03:42.600 --> 03:03:44.640]  is dangerous to public health.
[03:03:44.640 --> 03:03:48.880]  We know some parents are having a hard time deciding whether to vaccinate their children
[03:03:48.880 --> 03:03:51.040]  against COVID-19.
[03:03:51.040 --> 03:03:54.880]  But there are considerable risks to not getting your child vaccinated.
[03:03:54.880 --> 03:03:55.880]  In.
[03:03:55.880 --> 03:04:02.200]  How about Dr. Rubin, editor of New England Journal Medicine.
[03:04:02.200 --> 03:04:03.680]  They seem very safe.
[03:04:03.680 --> 03:04:07.280]  They seem very comparable to other vaccines.
[03:04:07.280 --> 03:04:09.720]  There you go.
[03:04:09.720 --> 03:04:13.720]  And as you can see that narrative just gets rolled out all around the country.
[03:04:13.720 --> 03:04:14.720]  It's just the same.
[03:04:14.720 --> 03:04:21.200]  It's really important that you guys support platforms like InfoWars and you know, we just
[03:04:21.200 --> 03:04:25.080]  want to say a big thank you to Alex Jones and the InfoWars team for having us on and
[03:04:25.080 --> 03:04:30.280]  for having our channel, Counterspin Media since November 11th, 2021.
[03:04:30.280 --> 03:04:33.480]  It's just been fantastic to get New Zealand out there.
[03:04:33.480 --> 03:04:37.520]  It's just, yeah, it's given us a real opportunity to bring our small nations story to the world
[03:04:37.520 --> 03:04:42.120]  and we just really want to encourage you to get behind the all the great nutraceuticals
[03:04:42.120 --> 03:04:43.720]  that they have on offer.
[03:04:43.720 --> 03:04:49.240]  The red, the real red pill plus is back, there's 50% off at the moment, so please check that
[03:04:49.240 --> 03:04:52.280]  out with the dangerous toxins that lie within our water.
[03:04:52.280 --> 03:04:56.800]  We know we need to filter out the bacteria, but as you age, you're filtering out all of
[03:04:56.800 --> 03:04:57.800]  the.
[03:04:57.800 --> 03:05:01.840]  Introducing our new incredible supplement line, InfoWars indeed.
[03:05:01.840 --> 03:05:07.320]  Now in 60 seconds, it's hard to tell you how incredible these products are, but all of
[03:05:07.320 --> 03:05:13.000]  these products are already sold on store shelves under other brand names for up to twice the
[03:05:13.000 --> 03:05:14.000]  cost.
[03:05:14.000 --> 03:05:15.000]  We're selling it to you.
[03:05:15.000 --> 03:05:16.000]  These are high end.
[03:05:16.000 --> 03:05:17.480]  These are the very best.
[03:05:17.480 --> 03:05:19.520]  You know, our body's Ultimate Turmeric formula is amazing.
[03:05:19.520 --> 03:05:20.520]  Well, guess what?
[03:05:20.520 --> 03:05:27.360]  We now have Turmeric 95 that's basically the same formula for a lower price CBD oil of the
[03:05:27.360 --> 03:05:33.920]  highest quality up to 50% less than major competitors selling the exact high quality
[03:05:33.920 --> 03:05:40.960]  full spectrum CBD and it goes on for all the new InfoWars MD products at infowarstore.com.
[03:05:40.960 --> 03:05:48.080]  The highest quality directly from the manufacturer to your door at prices up to 50% in some cases
[03:05:48.080 --> 03:05:50.960]  100% lower than what they're sold for in stores.
[03:05:50.960 --> 03:06:11.280]  InfoWars MD and infowarstore.com Alright, and we are back on the InfoWars 4th hour here,
[03:06:11.280 --> 03:06:15.520]  Countessford media, Calvin and Hannah coming to you from New Zealand.
[03:06:15.520 --> 03:06:21.840]  Now you may have been following what happened last year, 2022 in February.
[03:06:21.840 --> 03:06:27.760]  There was a convoy that was very much inspired by the Canadian Truckers Convoy and what
[03:06:27.760 --> 03:06:34.000]  we'd like to do now is actually get the B-roll running and the convoy came from the North
[03:06:34.000 --> 03:06:37.440]  Island all the way to Wellington and from the South Island all the way up to Wellington
[03:06:37.440 --> 03:06:42.560]  they had to cross over and what you're seeing here now, Calvin, are images from outside
[03:06:42.560 --> 03:06:46.280]  parliament where thousands of people were camped out for three weeks.
[03:06:46.280 --> 03:06:49.960]  Tens of thousands of people were cleaning up daily and there were some of course as
[03:06:49.960 --> 03:06:55.400]  you can see decided to make parliament grounds their own because it is and they decided it
[03:06:55.400 --> 03:07:00.600]  was time to send a message to government to state that we're not going to take it anymore.
[03:07:00.600 --> 03:07:04.600]  In fact they played that song quite a lot.
[03:07:04.600 --> 03:07:10.320]  This here, within a 10 day period there was a fully functioning town, it had everything,
[03:07:10.320 --> 03:07:16.360]  it had supply lines, it had medical, it had daycare for children, it had everything you
[03:07:16.360 --> 03:07:20.560]  could possibly want in a town environment.
[03:07:20.560 --> 03:07:26.520]  Unfortunately the government didn't like the fact that we were camping on their lawn and
[03:07:26.520 --> 03:07:32.800]  decided to send over 800 police officers in to quash it.
[03:07:32.800 --> 03:07:38.320]  Now a lot of violence was seen, we were reporting live throughout and we were bringing these
[03:07:38.320 --> 03:07:46.080]  scenes to the public unfiltered by the mainstream lens and as you can see there there's a lot
[03:07:46.080 --> 03:07:52.000]  of brutality going on, in fact people had broken sternums, fractured skulls, broken
[03:07:52.000 --> 03:07:59.280]  bones, many were pepper sprayed and gassed and this was a very peaceful protest.
[03:07:59.280 --> 03:08:05.240]  On the last day only did we have people that were not part of that protest turn up to cause
[03:08:05.240 --> 03:08:10.320]  a major problem in order to then have them say see we were justified in doing what we
[03:08:10.320 --> 03:08:11.320]  did.
[03:08:11.320 --> 03:08:17.600]  Where we know this sort of thing happens quite a lot throughout the world and different
[03:08:17.600 --> 03:08:18.600]  protests.
[03:08:18.600 --> 03:08:23.840]  And in that first week Kelvin went in day three, now what we're seeing, this is the
[03:08:23.840 --> 03:08:28.800]  last day where fires were started and people were actually saying that there was controlled
[03:08:28.800 --> 03:08:33.960]  opposition, agent provocateurs who were starting this mayhem and it was very much reported
[03:08:33.960 --> 03:08:39.760]  in the mainstream media to be like January 6th where they were trying to obviously storm
[03:08:39.760 --> 03:08:44.920]  into the capital and they were trying to draw the comparison but in fact it was completely
[03:08:44.920 --> 03:08:50.480]  different and you see there the lines of police and like I was going to say in the first week
[03:08:50.480 --> 03:08:55.080]  protest has held the line against the police for 12 hours and they didn't relent and so
[03:08:55.080 --> 03:08:59.760]  they managed to stay for another two to three weeks in total and then this last day was
[03:08:59.760 --> 03:09:05.800]  just absolutely devastating, there you go the pepper spray, they had rubber bullets,
[03:09:05.800 --> 03:09:11.120]  it was just absolutely horrific and for a small nation like New Zealand we hadn't seen
[03:09:11.120 --> 03:09:16.880]  a big convergence on parliament like this since the 1980s and it really was such an
[03:09:16.880 --> 03:09:21.760]  amazing and you'll see there are brown faces there but of course the mainstream media was
[03:09:21.760 --> 03:09:24.680]  reporting that it was full of white supremacists, the Nazis.
[03:09:24.680 --> 03:09:29.640]  Far right, we all seem to be far right, I'm still trying to find where the centre is.
[03:09:29.640 --> 03:09:34.080]  And if they mean far right by you're absolutely correct we will take that but other than that
[03:09:34.080 --> 03:09:36.440]  I have no idea what the hell we're talking about.
[03:09:36.440 --> 03:09:42.600]  And it's just the same playbook around the world, Counterspin was demonised for apparently
[03:09:42.600 --> 03:09:48.800]  you know causing a lot of the interest in this event but so many of you saw what was
[03:09:48.800 --> 03:09:53.760]  happening in that first week when the first lot of police came in and you could not do
[03:09:53.760 --> 03:09:57.000]  anything except get down there because it was just so horrific.
[03:09:57.000 --> 03:10:00.640]  Now after this whole event there was so much depression because it was actually such an
[03:10:00.640 --> 03:10:04.040]  amazing event you know as we said it was all free, you know everyone was just working
[03:10:04.040 --> 03:10:09.680]  together to hold the ground against the mandates, the government overreach, the tyranny that
[03:10:09.680 --> 03:10:11.040]  was coming out in New Zealand.
[03:10:11.040 --> 03:10:16.960]  Now what we did after that is we decided because people wanted us to carry on, we went on tour
[03:10:16.960 --> 03:10:21.800]  around New Zealand, now we just want to play you a clip here of the let's not forget tour
[03:10:21.800 --> 03:10:25.360]  where we want to lift everybody's spirits after that depressing moment in Wellington
[03:10:25.360 --> 03:10:27.640]  on March the 2nd.
[03:10:27.640 --> 03:10:35.720]  Okay it's Storm's maiden full glory presentation to the people so she's got her decals on,
[03:10:35.720 --> 03:10:42.000]  she's looking amazing and we're on the bus and we can't wait to meet the people of Wanganui.
[03:10:42.000 --> 03:10:43.520]  The storm is upon us.
[03:10:43.520 --> 03:10:44.520]  Storm's coming.
[03:10:44.520 --> 03:10:51.680]  We've got Paris our wonderful driver there at the front, made the trek down from Tauranga
[03:10:51.680 --> 03:10:53.600]  and we are of course in Wanganui.
[03:10:53.600 --> 03:10:54.600]  We are indeed.
[03:10:54.600 --> 03:11:00.600]  And we look forward to meeting all the people.
[03:11:00.600 --> 03:11:01.600]  And we're off.
[03:11:01.600 --> 03:11:13.600]  And here we have the counter spin bus, the storm is coming.
[03:11:13.600 --> 03:11:14.600]  Here we are.
[03:11:14.600 --> 03:11:15.600]  Just past that.
[03:11:15.600 --> 03:11:16.600]  There's Dana our tour manager.
[03:11:16.600 --> 03:11:29.160]  Truth, courage, freedom, New Zealand's media revolution, counter spin.
[03:11:29.160 --> 03:11:31.160]  How beautiful does it look team?
[03:11:31.160 --> 03:11:32.160]  All right.
[03:11:32.160 --> 03:11:33.160]  Look at that.
[03:11:33.160 --> 03:11:34.160]  For the people, try the people.
[03:11:34.160 --> 03:11:52.160]  The way it's progressing in, that is stunning.
[03:11:52.160 --> 03:11:55.160]  We're live streaming here from Wanganui, we're just about to go have a quick change, we'll
[03:11:55.160 --> 03:11:56.160]  see you soon.
[03:11:56.160 --> 03:11:57.160]  Look forward to it guys, see you in there.
[03:11:57.160 --> 03:12:07.160]  And Calvin, how did you find that tour?
[03:12:07.160 --> 03:12:08.920]  It was an amazing tour actually.
[03:12:08.920 --> 03:12:14.160]  We got to see all parts of the country and we got to hear everybody's stories.
[03:12:14.160 --> 03:12:16.320]  In fact, we took the show to them.
[03:12:16.320 --> 03:12:21.960]  We gave them the mic so they could get everything that they had locked up inside out.
[03:12:21.960 --> 03:12:28.200]  We asked polling questions at every event, how many people know those who have been injured
[03:12:28.200 --> 03:12:29.200]  by this jab?
[03:12:29.200 --> 03:12:32.400]  I refuse to call it a vaccine because it is not.
[03:12:32.400 --> 03:12:33.400]  It is a jab.
[03:12:33.400 --> 03:12:38.000]  It's a weapon that's causing a lot of carnage, certainly here in New Zealand, Dr. Guy Hatchard
[03:12:38.000 --> 03:12:43.040]  who will be on with us in the next segment, we'll attest to that and bring the actual
[03:12:43.040 --> 03:12:48.480]  stats to bear to show you exactly what's happening here.
[03:12:48.480 --> 03:12:52.400]  I think you'll have the same thing in the US and in other parts of the Western world.
[03:12:52.400 --> 03:12:57.160]  We had a lot of people also sharing their experiences from down in Wellington, either
[03:12:57.160 --> 03:13:01.840]  the police brutality or the amazing uplifting experiences down there.
[03:13:01.840 --> 03:13:07.080]  It was really because New Zealand was smashed after the Wellington protests ended in such
[03:13:07.080 --> 03:13:12.160]  a violent way because we have 120 politicians here in New Zealand at the beehive and not
[03:13:12.160 --> 03:13:17.680]  one single one of them came out to talk to the protesters and see what they were about.
[03:13:17.680 --> 03:13:23.360]  The mainstream media was absolutely silencing the voices of the people and they were twisting
[03:13:23.360 --> 03:13:27.120]  the narrative and made it and demonised the protesters.
[03:13:27.120 --> 03:13:30.920]  They have 120 parasites there in New Zealand reaching off the people.
[03:13:30.920 --> 03:13:31.920]  Yes, exactly.
[03:13:31.920 --> 03:13:36.840]  So that was part of the tour and people really loved it and like Kevin said we did a lot
[03:13:36.840 --> 03:13:41.960]  of stories but what we want to tell you now is that we were actually arrested and they
[03:13:41.960 --> 03:13:45.560]  stole the footage that we got on that tour.
[03:13:45.560 --> 03:13:50.760]  Now this happened after a documentary came out called Fire and Fury.
[03:13:50.760 --> 03:14:00.360]  Now we have a little clip of that that was made by mainstream media here in New Zealand.
[03:14:00.360 --> 03:14:04.360]  And in 2021 Alp launched Counterspin Media.
[03:14:04.360 --> 03:14:05.720]  We must hold the line.
[03:14:05.720 --> 03:14:06.720]  We are in a war.
[03:14:06.720 --> 03:14:07.880]  It's an information war.
[03:14:07.880 --> 03:14:13.760]  A far right online TV channel running at that stage on the platform of former Trump campaign
[03:14:13.760 --> 03:14:15.080]  chief Steve Bannon.
[03:14:15.080 --> 03:14:21.040]  Are you prepared to give it up and let these elites take it and just give it away?
[03:14:21.040 --> 03:14:24.480]  That's the power that elected Donald Trump.
[03:14:24.480 --> 03:14:31.520]  Bannon believes the 2020 US election was stolen and calls mainstream media the opposition.
[03:14:31.520 --> 03:14:37.760]  And all the mainstream media hailed as the great podium of truth, I call it bullc**t,
[03:14:37.760 --> 03:14:42.040]  has turned out to be complete and that's the false fake phony liars.
[03:14:42.040 --> 03:14:43.040]  Incredible.
[03:14:43.040 --> 03:14:44.040]  Absolutely incredible.
[03:14:44.040 --> 03:14:50.800]  This is about identity making and meaning making to claim a space of leadership, a claim
[03:14:50.800 --> 03:14:51.800]  of space of importance.
[03:14:51.800 --> 03:14:56.840]  So if the military command is watching this and I guarantee you they will be.
[03:14:56.840 --> 03:15:01.680]  Counterspin live streams throughout the Wellington occupation without repeatedly calling for
[03:15:01.680 --> 03:15:05.440]  an overthrow of the government, including a military coup.
[03:15:05.440 --> 03:15:14.200]  We'll be happy for it to be in your safe hands because the criminals that occupy Parasite
[03:15:14.200 --> 03:15:20.000]  Palace, laughing they couldn't be alive, need to be gone.
[03:15:20.000 --> 03:15:24.320]  Fellow Counterspin presenter Hannah Spearer is Kelvin Elbs' partner.
[03:15:24.320 --> 03:15:29.240]  She describes herself as an anti-feminist and a patriot.
[03:15:29.240 --> 03:15:33.840]  To resist, of course, this tyrannical government which is not going to stop, it's a system
[03:15:33.840 --> 03:15:40.320]  of course, as we all know, just going around the globe and, you know, at this point, slavery
[03:15:40.320 --> 03:15:41.320]  versus freedom.
[03:15:41.320 --> 03:15:46.080]  And it was absolutely atrocious there, Kelvin, trying to slander you and trying to say that
[03:15:46.080 --> 03:15:51.320]  you were actually trying to instigate some sort of overthrow, it was absolutely false.
[03:15:51.320 --> 03:15:54.400]  On the other side of the break, when we come back, we'll have Dr. Guy Hatch out, but we'll
[03:15:54.400 --> 03:15:57.960]  explain a little more on that beforehand.
[03:15:57.960 --> 03:16:03.360]  The powerful combination of both vitamin C and zinc are great stepping stones to leading
[03:16:03.360 --> 03:16:05.400]  a healthier life.
[03:16:05.400 --> 03:16:09.240]  InfoWars has made it easier to make sure you are getting enough in your system with a supplement
[03:16:09.240 --> 03:16:10.880]  that contains both.
[03:16:10.880 --> 03:16:15.840]  This InfoWars life offering vitamin C plus zinc with rose hips should be your next purchase
[03:16:15.840 --> 03:16:17.440]  from the InfoWars store.
[03:16:17.440 --> 03:16:22.280]  The rose hips contained within are a part of the rose flower just below the petals that
[03:16:22.280 --> 03:16:24.960]  contain the rose plant seeds.
[03:16:24.960 --> 03:16:29.800]  Natural chemicals found in the hips may even be helpful for a variety of health conditions
[03:16:29.800 --> 03:16:34.520]  including those with osteoarthritis and for those with pain after surgery studies have
[03:16:34.520 --> 03:16:35.520]  shown.
[03:16:35.520 --> 03:16:39.800]  As for vitamin C and zinc themselves, you probably already know that they play an important
[03:16:39.800 --> 03:16:44.400]  role in nutrition, immune defense, and the maintenance of your everyday health.
[03:16:44.400 --> 03:16:49.480]  It has been reported that intake of both is often inadequate, even in affluent populations
[03:16:49.480 --> 03:16:50.480]  like here in America.
[03:16:50.480 --> 03:16:55.320]  So next time you visit, be sure to check it out at InfoWarsStore.com where we promise
[03:16:55.320 --> 03:16:57.200]  our rose hips don't lie.
[03:16:57.200 --> 03:17:01.360]  I've taken a lot of supplements over the years since high school and they had great
[03:17:01.360 --> 03:17:06.120]  effects and the science has gotten better and better and better over the years.
[03:17:06.120 --> 03:17:10.880]  And now with all the things we're bombarded with and the water and the food and the feminizing
[03:17:10.880 --> 03:17:15.360]  factors, it is more important than ever to use the compounds God gave us to boost our
[03:17:15.360 --> 03:17:16.920]  natural male potential.
[03:17:16.920 --> 03:17:18.880]  These products work great for women as well.
[03:17:18.880 --> 03:17:22.840]  Ladies and gentlemen, we have PainMD, it's the number one natural best seller under
[03:17:22.840 --> 03:17:28.720]  another name, we got it discounted for 40% off InfoWarsStore.com under the label InfoWars
[03:17:28.720 --> 03:17:29.720]  Platinum.

[03:17:31.880 --> 03:17:35.840]  Read all about it, be very safe with it, I take only a fraction of what they say at
[03:17:35.840 --> 03:17:40.280]  first and take it before you go to bed at night, don't do it during the day.
[03:17:40.280 --> 03:17:43.480]  1776 testosterone boost, totally incredible.
[03:17:43.480 --> 03:17:49.600]  Go read about them, learn more about them at InfoWarsStore.com in the InfoWars Platinum
[03:17:49.600 --> 03:17:56.480]  section and you'll get 40% off on these already bestselling products under the new name InfoWars
[03:17:56.480 --> 03:17:57.480]  Platinum.
[03:17:57.480 --> 03:18:03.040]  They want the planet for themselves my friends, if we're so stupid we let them kill us, we
[03:18:03.040 --> 03:18:11.400]  deserve it, except the children don't deserve it do they?
[03:18:11.400 --> 03:18:26.960]  And I looked and behold, a pale horse and he that sat on the horse was named Death.
[03:18:26.960 --> 03:18:37.520]  Now the translation is I looked and behold a pale horse and his name that sat on him
[03:18:37.520 --> 03:18:44.440]  was Death and Hell followed with him, the book of Revelation.
[03:18:44.440 --> 03:18:47.920]  Very serious times to be alive folks, they're not just doing this as one off, this is the
[03:18:47.920 --> 03:18:51.960]  beginning of the rest of our lives, this is our fight and I'm proud of humanity.
[03:18:51.960 --> 03:18:55.800]  The globalists even admit it's leaked, they're very upset that they're losing and that this
[03:18:55.800 --> 03:18:57.600]  hasn't gone the way they thought it would.
[03:18:57.600 --> 03:19:03.280]  InfoWars MD is finally here, it's the very same high quality products you've been getting
[03:19:03.280 --> 03:19:09.640]  through InfoWars Life but an expanded catalog and in some cases the prices are lower because
[03:19:09.640 --> 03:19:15.120]  we're going directly to the source that was supplying the supplement companies that we
[03:19:15.120 --> 03:19:20.160]  were buying our high quality products from, so we're able to lower prices and bring you
[03:19:20.160 --> 03:19:23.760]  more products via the InfoWars MD line.
[03:19:23.760 --> 03:19:28.440]  The highest quality, triple tested, many of these products are sold on store shelves for
[03:19:28.440 --> 03:19:34.800]  more than twice the cost, you'll get them at infowarsstore.com under our exclusive label.
[03:19:34.800 --> 03:19:38.880]  We are bringing you the highest quality supplements directly from the factory right here in the
[03:19:38.880 --> 03:19:44.360]  USA to your door, it'll make your life healthy, better, boost your immune system and it keeps
[03:19:44.360 --> 03:19:46.560]  InfoWars store on the air.
[03:19:46.560 --> 03:19:52.640]  So again, introducing InfoWars MD, now exclusively available at infowarsstore.com with massive
[03:19:52.640 --> 03:19:58.800]  sales.
[03:19:58.800 --> 03:20:08.800]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:20:08.800 --> 03:20:20.360]  Great and welcome back to the fourth hour on the Alex Jones show, hosted by Hannah and
[03:20:20.360 --> 03:20:24.120]  Calvin from Counterspin, we are going to bring Guy Hatch out on shortly, but before we do
[03:20:24.120 --> 03:20:28.200]  that we just wanted to explain from that previous segment, what happened to Calvin after that
[03:20:28.200 --> 03:20:31.920]  foreign fury documentary aired 10 days later?
[03:20:31.920 --> 03:20:36.560]  10 days later we were arrested on August 25th last year, we've had three quarter appearances
[03:20:36.560 --> 03:20:43.200]  so far, the arrest was forced hearing a link to a foreign website, a UK investigative documentary
[03:20:43.200 --> 03:20:49.880]  that was going on into the incident that we had here in Christchurch March 15th 2019.
[03:20:49.880 --> 03:20:53.560]  Really they don't like questions being asked, they don't like a real investigative journalism
[03:20:53.560 --> 03:21:00.280]  that's saying, hey your official narrative stinks, we've got more holes and twisties and
[03:21:00.280 --> 03:21:05.120]  in true fashion we're holding the line, we're not taking our foot off the gas and we are
[03:21:05.120 --> 03:21:06.920]  going to put fat on that.
[03:21:06.920 --> 03:21:11.320]  Yes Calvin and that link was actually posted way back in February and it took them over
[03:21:11.320 --> 03:21:14.920]  six months to actually get their case sorted, they didn't give us a takedown order, they
[03:21:14.920 --> 03:21:19.080]  didn't ask us to remove the link or review anything that we had done, we didn't actually
[03:21:19.080 --> 03:21:20.080]  post any.
[03:21:20.080 --> 03:21:24.880]  And here's the kicker, it was made objectionable after it was posted.
[03:21:24.880 --> 03:21:29.800]  Yes and that is very interesting and we haven't shared any footage of the live stream that
[03:21:29.800 --> 03:21:34.080]  the shooter put out, Brenton Tarrant because of course that was deemed objectionable and
[03:21:34.080 --> 03:21:40.280]  also the manifesto so we haven't done anything like that and yet still we are facing 14 years
[03:21:40.280 --> 03:21:45.640]  in jail and if you would like to help us out, counterspin at media.com, our legal fees are
[03:21:45.640 --> 03:21:50.240]  starting to mount up, so like everywhere if you're telling the truth they come after you
[03:21:50.240 --> 03:21:56.400]  and just before we bring Guy on now we also want to give you a quick update on Baby Will,
[03:21:56.400 --> 03:21:58.840]  many of you will have been following that story last year.
[03:21:58.840 --> 03:22:02.080]  Well was that an amazing job getting that global?
[03:22:02.080 --> 03:22:07.960]  They absolutely did and of course Baby Will simply needed life saving heart surgery and
[03:22:07.960 --> 03:22:13.800]  his parents wanted the unvaccinated blood and here in New Zealand the New Zealand blood
[03:22:13.800 --> 03:22:21.040]  donor organisation would not allow the over 20 donors that the family already had lined
[03:22:21.040 --> 03:22:23.800]  up to give him the blood, they would not allow that to happen.
[03:22:23.800 --> 03:22:28.280]  So Baby Will is doing very well, he went home just before Christmas, he's recovering
[03:22:28.280 --> 03:22:33.280]  at home, he's still getting help with his feeding through the tube but his parents are
[03:22:33.280 --> 03:22:36.520]  very happy and it's all very good at this point.
[03:22:36.520 --> 03:22:40.040]  But of course everyone knows the very estate actors, what do your parents do for you to
[03:22:40.040 --> 03:22:42.960]  take guardianship to make that operation happen?
[03:22:42.960 --> 03:22:47.680]  We hear that there is suspicion that unjabbed blood was actually used, we will be able to
[03:22:47.680 --> 03:22:50.280]  confirm that shortly.
[03:22:50.280 --> 03:22:54.440]  So yeah but my problem is the full case, the precedent is still set and that's what I do
[03:22:54.440 --> 03:22:55.440]  not like.
[03:22:55.440 --> 03:23:01.240]  That's right and we now don't have a right to unjabbed blood and we're going to bring
[03:23:01.240 --> 03:23:05.840]  Guy Hatchard on now to talk about this very thing, the vaccines and exactly what's happening
[03:23:05.840 --> 03:23:09.240]  here in New Zealand, yeah they aren't a vaccine.
[03:23:09.240 --> 03:23:15.840]  Now if you don't know Guy Hatchard and our US audience probably doesn't, Guy is an international
[03:23:15.840 --> 03:23:20.600]  advocate for food safety and natural medicines, he received his undergraduate degree in logic
[03:23:20.600 --> 03:23:26.800]  and theoretical physics, he was formerly a senior manager at Genetic ID, a global food
[03:23:26.800 --> 03:23:32.720]  safety testing and certification laboratory, welcome to the show Guy.
[03:23:32.720 --> 03:23:43.320]  Good to be here, good to be here with your global audience and we're here in New Zealand,
[03:23:43.320 --> 03:23:50.600]  we're in a situation as many other countries are where we have excess all cause deaths,
[03:23:50.600 --> 03:23:59.520]  we have very few deaths from COVID and what we're seeing is that the more injections that
[03:23:59.520 --> 03:24:09.440]  you have, the more susceptible you are to serious illness and death if you catch COVID
[03:24:09.440 --> 03:24:16.800]  and I know that this is familiar to viewers, we're seeing it all over the world but we
[03:24:16.800 --> 03:24:22.800]  are in a unique position here in New Zealand because we had a whole year when we didn't
[03:24:22.800 --> 03:24:32.720]  have any COVID but we had the vaccinations and so you can't blame the excess deaths
[03:24:32.720 --> 03:24:40.800]  on the COVID itself because what we saw was that as the number of vaccinations increased
[03:24:40.800 --> 03:24:50.880]  so did the rate of deaths, so we're kind of sitting back from this now and we're thinking
[03:24:50.880 --> 03:24:56.320]  well what can we do about this, what do we face in the future and the key point that
[03:24:56.320 --> 03:25:04.120]  I want to contribute this morning is the fact that what has happened is that we've seen
[03:25:04.120 --> 03:25:09.720]  that biotechnology is essentially very, very dangerous.
[03:25:09.720 --> 03:25:19.160]  So we've launched a global campaign, a campaign, we're calling it globe, a campaign for global
[03:25:19.160 --> 03:25:26.720]  legislation to outlaw biotechnology experimentation and I want to show you how this works. If
[03:25:26.720 --> 03:25:31.280]  we can have the slide that I have on the physiology as a whole.
[03:25:31.280 --> 03:25:38.880]  Yes, that should be image six approximately, the physiology image and that's your VEX image,
[03:25:38.880 --> 03:25:41.520]  we've got the VEX steps up there first guy.
[03:25:41.520 --> 03:25:49.480]  It basically shows in the dark green that as far as COVID deaths are concerned 53% in
[03:25:49.480 --> 03:25:55.800]  October were boosted and they accounted for 71% of the deaths and you can see from the
[03:25:55.800 --> 03:26:02.040]  green bar getting bigger and bigger that the situation is getting worse and worse. So let's
[03:26:02.040 --> 03:26:06.200]  move on to the next slide.
[03:26:06.200 --> 03:26:16.880]  This is I think absolutely critical to the whole issue that has come up. What has happened
[03:26:16.880 --> 03:26:23.840]  now is that medical interventions are now the leading cause of death in the world and
[03:26:23.840 --> 03:26:28.480]  that's what COVID has done for us, that's what COVID vaccination has done for. We know
[03:26:28.480 --> 03:26:34.960]  COVID come from a lab and we know the vaccination interferes with the way our DNA works. How
[03:26:34.960 --> 03:26:42.880]  does it do that? In this diagram you can see that the DNA is the controlling center of
[03:26:42.880 --> 03:26:49.800]  intelligence in the physiology and the interface at the bottom of the chart between DNA and
[03:26:49.800 --> 03:26:57.360]  the rest of the physiology, all the macromolecules, the cells, tissues, organs and organ systems.
[03:26:57.360 --> 03:27:07.600]  The interface is the RNA. The RNA is what transfers information from the DNA and controls
[03:27:07.600 --> 03:27:17.600]  the way the body works. So mRNA vaccination changes the way that the RNA works and that's
[03:27:17.600 --> 03:27:25.000]  why we're seeing such a huge range of side effects. In the liver, in the kidneys, in
[03:27:25.000 --> 03:27:32.480]  the brain, neurological systems, in the heart, the circulatory systems and so on. This is
[03:27:32.480 --> 03:27:40.840]  absolutely dangerous technology and so that's why we've launched this campaign for global
[03:27:40.840 --> 03:27:50.800]  legislation outlawing biotechnology experimentation and the center for that is our site globe.global.
[03:27:50.800 --> 03:27:57.880]  So we're launching this from New Zealand and we're reaching out all across the world to
[03:27:57.880 --> 03:28:09.480]  basically say we have a system that is a biotechnology system that is really affecting our health
[03:28:09.480 --> 03:28:19.200]  in every area of our health. It's unbelievable. People knew about this. People in biotechnology,
[03:28:19.200 --> 03:28:23.960]  I worked in biotechnology, people knew that it was dangerous but they went ahead with
[03:28:23.960 --> 03:28:28.560]  commercial pressures and undermining the day. Yeah, absolutely. And what we're going to
[03:28:28.560 --> 03:28:32.640]  do, Guy, is we're going to just cut to the break shortly and what we're going to do when
[03:28:32.640 --> 03:28:37.680]  we come back is because people are losing so much faith now in big pharma, we're going
[03:28:37.680 --> 03:28:42.320]  to talk about how the New Zealand government is shutting down natural herbs and natural
[03:28:42.320 --> 03:28:47.200]  medicines and actually going to take away our birthright to actually heal our families
[03:28:47.200 --> 03:28:51.400]  and heal our bodies with everything that God provided on this earth and it's also being
[03:28:51.400 --> 03:28:53.200]  taken over by big pharma.
[03:28:53.200 --> 03:28:54.200]  Thanks.
[03:28:54.200 --> 03:29:02.360]  Look, it's not hype when you've delivered and Info Wars has been the tip of spear against

[03:30:25.240 --> 03:30:33.040]  need you to wear masks and I also need you to only shop at mega corporations. That way
[03:30:33.040 --> 03:30:40.280]  we can consolidate control and bankrupt the world economy, leaving companies that only
[03:30:40.280 --> 03:30:49.160]  I own profitable. You will then be my slave. Oh, and then you get that special shot of

[03:31:57.720 --> 03:32:04.360]  Mark Twain, one of America's greatest riders in satyrists and minds, famously said more
[03:32:04.360 --> 03:32:10.920]  than 150 years ago, rumors of his demise had been greatly exaggerated because the newspapers
[03:32:10.920 --> 03:32:17.240]  kept saying he died decades before he did die. And it's the same scyop today. InfoWars
[03:32:17.240 --> 03:32:21.080]  is more influential and more powerful than ever because of your support and because
[03:32:21.080 --> 03:32:25.520]  of the facts of what we've covered is coming true. But if they can convince you we've been
[03:32:25.520 --> 03:32:30.640]  shut down, if they can convince you that we're going away and you stop supporting, you stop
[03:32:30.640 --> 03:32:35.840]  spreading the word, then they do win. Ladies and gentlemen, there's only one group of people
[03:32:35.840 --> 03:32:39.800]  that can shut down InfoWars and that's you, the viewers and listeners. If you decide we're
[03:32:39.800 --> 03:32:44.680]  done, we're done. If you decide to go to InfoWarsTour.com against supplements and books and films
[03:32:44.680 --> 03:32:49.040]  and t-shirts and so much more, we will stay on the air indefinitely. It is all in your
[03:32:49.040 --> 03:32:53.760]  hands. So thanks for your support. Stand up against the globalists. Go to InfoWarsTour.com
[03:32:53.760 --> 03:32:59.240]  right now and keep us on air. It's up to you.
[03:32:59.240 --> 03:33:13.160]  Speaking of frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:33:13.160 --> 03:33:17.880]  And now we are continuing our chat with Dr. Guy Hatchard because it's really important
[03:33:17.880 --> 03:33:22.320]  that we understand what's happening here in New Zealand. We have the Therapeutic Products
[03:33:22.320 --> 03:33:27.840]  Bill that was tabled to the New Zealand Parliament last year on the 30th of November and it's
[03:33:27.840 --> 03:33:32.320]  been through its first reading right before Christmas on the 14th of December when everyone
[03:33:32.320 --> 03:33:38.360]  was getting ready to wind down for the summer down here down under. And of course it will
[03:33:38.360 --> 03:33:45.560]  go through for a second reading and submissions are due by the 15th of February here in New
[03:33:45.560 --> 03:33:50.760]  Zealand. So Dr. Guy, please can you tell us why people need to be aware of the Therapeutics
[03:33:50.760 --> 03:33:54.400]  Bill and what are the problems with it?
[03:33:54.400 --> 03:34:01.560]  The Therapeutics Products Bill is an enabling bill. An enabling bill appoints a regulator
[03:34:01.560 --> 03:34:08.680]  and it says this regulator can do virtually whatever he wants to control our natural products
[03:34:08.680 --> 03:34:14.960]  and supplements and so on. So it's a blank check. And what exactly are they going to
[03:34:14.960 --> 03:34:20.400]  do? Well, the thrust of the bill is that the government wishes to control herbs which
[03:34:20.400 --> 03:34:29.640]  are actually foods by classing them as therapeutic products. And so anything that can benefit
[03:34:29.640 --> 03:34:38.960]  health can be classed as a therapeutic project and as we know most foods benefit health and
[03:34:38.960 --> 03:34:46.120]  then they want to control the use of these and introduce synthetics. So here's a list
[03:34:46.120 --> 03:34:53.880]  of an extract from a list of 300 herbs which the Ministry of Health here wishes to control
[03:34:53.880 --> 03:35:00.400]  and you can see there are some things that are very familiar to us. Coconut, tea leaf,
[03:35:00.400 --> 03:35:08.640]  cardamom, mustard. These are all common foods actually but the government wishes to classify
[03:35:08.640 --> 03:35:17.160]  them as therapeutic products and amazing, absolutely amazing. At the same time in the
[03:35:17.160 --> 03:35:24.520]  same list it's actually a list of 5,000 ingredients. There are 3,000 synthetics which the government
[03:35:24.520 --> 03:35:32.680]  wants to introduce. So, for example, eggplant. Why are we controlling eggplant? Well, eggplant
[03:35:32.680 --> 03:35:38.960]  has some compounds in it which are similar to steroids and so they're beneficial in some
[03:35:38.960 --> 03:35:42.800]  particular way for the health. Our body knows how to absorb them because they're based on
[03:35:42.800 --> 03:35:51.640]  DNA and we're based on DNA. But in therapeutic products the government would rather like
[03:35:51.640 --> 03:36:00.200]  to kowtow to the pharmaceutical industry and control the use of these in any settlements.
[03:36:00.200 --> 03:36:05.480]  The same thing is happening in the USA. The Biden administration has just called for all
[03:36:05.480 --> 03:36:12.720]  supplement and natural products manufacturers to register with the FDA. So this is coming
[03:36:12.720 --> 03:36:21.160]  and it's being driven by the International Coalition of Medicine's Regulatory Authorities
[03:36:21.160 --> 03:36:27.240]  which is a non-governmental organization largely funded by the pharmaceutical industry which
[03:36:27.240 --> 03:36:33.680]  operates a database which is locked in to all the medicine regulatory authorities in
[03:36:33.680 --> 03:36:39.560]  countries around the world. So where is the government getting these ideas from? They're
[03:36:39.560 --> 03:36:49.160]  simply being fed in directly through information held in databases and in that way they want
[03:36:49.160 --> 03:37:01.320]  to regulate our whole food supply. So basically what they're doing is they're taking something
[03:37:01.320 --> 03:37:08.440]  natural like our own physiology that knows how to heal itself. Everything that was God
[03:37:08.440 --> 03:37:14.480]  given on the earth, I've always said that there's something natural for every element
[03:37:14.480 --> 03:37:20.120]  both known and there's a note to be known to man and our bodies are very well designed
[03:37:20.120 --> 03:37:25.280]  machines for that in that respect. So these people basically want to take away all the
[03:37:25.280 --> 03:37:29.960]  goodness, replace it with all their rubbish and turn you into a medical junkie. Would
[03:37:29.960 --> 03:37:36.120]  that be right? It's already happening. I mean if you look at your labels in your supermarket
[03:37:36.120 --> 03:37:41.040]  you might buy some vanilla ice cream for example and you look and it says it has natural vanilla
[03:37:41.040 --> 03:37:47.720]  flavor. Well that's actually not coming from the vanilla plant. It's coming from a biotechnology
[03:37:47.720 --> 03:37:55.240]  vat. If it was vanilla it would have to say natural vanilla extract, real vanilla. This
[03:37:55.240 --> 03:37:59.800]  is happening across the board. All these synthetics are coming in and they're not the same as
[03:37:59.800 --> 03:38:05.320]  their natural counterparts. Our body is not necessarily adjusted to them and what we're
[03:38:05.320 --> 03:38:12.000]  looking here is you know there are very few things left and you know this that we have
[03:38:12.000 --> 03:38:19.240]  control over these days. The government wants to control everything. We have our consciousness,
[03:38:19.240 --> 03:38:25.680]  we have our experience, we have our behavior and we also have our food and now they want
[03:38:25.680 --> 03:38:33.120]  to take that food away from us and change basically what has been the subject of millions
[03:38:33.120 --> 03:38:42.040]  of years of evolution. We have a co-dependent relationship with our sources of food, DNA.
[03:38:42.040 --> 03:38:46.400]  We're all part of the biological... Can I just cut in here and say how does that fit
[03:38:46.400 --> 03:38:55.040]  in with the Codex elementarius and what overarching organizations are doing like the United Nations
[03:38:55.040 --> 03:39:03.080]  and how are they trying to basically get control of everything through the government policies?
[03:39:03.080 --> 03:39:11.760]  Yeah, there are many initiatives here. I'm principally... There was a time when people
[03:39:11.760 --> 03:39:16.440]  were publishing rules and people were signing up for rules. This is how we're going to manage
[03:39:16.440 --> 03:39:20.920]  health or this is how we're going to do this. This is this agreement. But now it's done
[03:39:20.920 --> 03:39:30.280]  directly through information. All these interlocking databases, so you have that Codex elementarius
[03:39:30.280 --> 03:39:39.560]  which was a push to regulate our food supply and our medical system but it's gone way
[03:39:39.560 --> 03:39:46.120]  beyond that. Now we have private operators in the global space between countries who
[03:39:46.120 --> 03:39:52.640]  are basically locked into government databases and when a minister is deciding on a policy
[03:39:52.640 --> 03:39:59.240]  or a new law, he's simply fed a sheet of this is how it's done and this is exactly what's
[03:39:59.240 --> 03:40:04.960]  happening here in New Zealand now. This is the third attempt to get this through. There
[03:40:04.960 --> 03:40:09.800]  have been big pushback from the population because of course 50% of people take natural
[03:40:09.800 --> 03:40:14.840]  products but the government now is girding its loins and saying we're going to do this
[03:40:14.840 --> 03:40:19.640]  like Hitler did it basically. We're just going to pass a law that says this chap can tell
[03:40:19.640 --> 03:40:27.400]  everybody what to do. The other really concerning thing, Guy, is that this bill will implement
[03:40:27.400 --> 03:40:33.240]  the need for any natural practitioner to have a sponsor. Now can you just elaborate on that
[03:40:33.240 --> 03:40:37.320]  because that is not actually a government trained person. It's just somebody who has
[03:40:37.320 --> 03:40:41.720]  a good reputable standing in the community and they are basically going to become a spy
[03:40:41.720 --> 03:40:47.840]  for anybody who wants to have a natural practice or have natural therapies.
[03:40:47.840 --> 03:40:52.640]  Yeah, government will be looking over our shoulder. It will be pretty soon to be looking
[03:40:52.640 --> 03:41:00.200]  over our shoulder when we have our lunch. That's the extent of it. Look, it's an impossible
[03:41:00.200 --> 03:41:07.040]  task. There are 100,000 plants. They need an army of people to regulate 100,000 plants
[03:41:07.040 --> 03:41:15.200]  and control everybody and it will be prohibitively costly. In fact, the estimated cost of it
[03:41:15.200 --> 03:41:24.360]  runs into hundreds of millions to put this kind of system in place. The easy part of
[03:41:24.360 --> 03:41:29.800]  them is we'll just ban this and we'll ban that and we'll tell them they can't do this.
[03:41:29.800 --> 03:41:34.960]  That's the kind of what we'll end up with. We're seeing this in countries all around
[03:41:34.960 --> 03:41:35.960]  the world.
[03:41:35.960 --> 03:41:39.040]  Because they control the borders, they're going to decide what comes in and what comes
[03:41:39.040 --> 03:41:42.960]  out anyway. Things we can't get here on our own. I've always maintained from the start
[03:41:42.960 --> 03:41:49.040]  we do not have a health system. We have an illness maintenance system. There is no profit
[03:41:49.040 --> 03:41:51.480]  in curing people or keeping them healthy.
[03:41:51.480 --> 03:41:57.360]  Yeah, as we said in the last segment, now medical intervention is the leading cause
[03:41:57.360 --> 03:42:02.680]  of death in the world. It used to be the third leading cause of death, but now it's sort
[03:42:02.680 --> 03:42:09.720]  of slotted up to number one. The more of this kind of synthetic biotechnology that comes
[03:42:09.720 --> 03:42:16.320]  in, the worse our health becomes. We have to get back to basics, really, absolutely,
[03:42:16.320 --> 03:42:24.760]  and food, DNA, food based on DNA, that people get back to basics in terms of how they talk
[03:42:24.760 --> 03:42:32.360]  to their politicians and MPs. Emails are not working. Petitions aren't working. People
[03:42:32.360 --> 03:42:37.640]  need to get on the phone to their local MP. They need to get into their office and actually
[03:42:37.640 --> 03:42:41.320]  go and have boots on the ground and talk to these people directly and tell them you do
[03:42:41.320 --> 03:42:47.080]  not stand by this and you want to maintain your birthright to natural remedies.
[03:42:47.080 --> 03:42:51.880]  So Guy Hatcher, thank you so much for joining us. We really appreciated you being on with

[03:47:58.120 --> 03:48:00.720]  Calvin what are we doing in this last final segment here?
[03:48:00.720 --> 03:48:04.120]  Okay we're going to have a talk about what's really happening in this country and please
[03:48:04.120 --> 03:48:07.600]  sing along if you know this tune you're probably getting it in your country as well. Let's look
[03:48:07.600 --> 03:48:14.400]  at some of the gifts that the New Zealand government just keeps giving and bought us in 2022 and
[03:48:14.400 --> 03:48:20.840]  of course into 2023. Yeah so the first look we want to talk well the first thing we want
[03:48:20.840 --> 03:48:25.840]  to talk about is the increased gun violence that should be image nine if we got everything
[03:48:25.840 --> 03:48:32.720]  in line in the end because of course after the Christchurch massacre the gun laws were
[03:48:32.720 --> 03:48:37.720]  heavily changed weren't they Calvin? Immediately they already had them on standby ready to
[03:48:37.720 --> 03:48:41.920]  go they just needed a reason to put them in. And now they've got 23 drive by shootings
[03:48:41.920 --> 03:48:47.760]  in just one single week and this was actually right after Jacinda Ardern went on her global
[03:48:47.760 --> 03:48:53.400]  tour and she was over in the United States and she was on the Stephen Colbert show and
[03:48:53.400 --> 03:48:57.840]  she's actually been over there telling the US how they should manage their guns and
[03:48:57.840 --> 03:49:02.880]  I'm sure many of you are very unhappy with that. Yeah well here she is she comes she
[03:49:02.880 --> 03:49:08.240]  decimates the gun laws here and basically does a buy back scheme how you can buy something
[03:49:08.240 --> 03:49:15.680]  back that you never owned who knows but they did anyway and as a result increased gun crime
[03:49:15.680 --> 03:49:23.040]  so many ram raids so many attacks on dairy owners the violence here has gone through
[03:49:23.040 --> 03:49:30.480]  the roof since she came in with her nice kind gestures and grimacing little face and telling
[03:49:30.480 --> 03:49:35.040]  everyone be kind to each other well they did exactly the opposite. And of course that's
[03:49:35.040 --> 03:49:38.560]  basically what the Democrats have done as well like in the democratic states Calvin where
[03:49:38.560 --> 03:49:47.440]  they have high gun control laws that the violence and the gun criminals criminals are through
[03:49:47.440 --> 03:49:51.320]  the roof so it's not the good upstanding citizens that have their gun licenses that
[03:49:51.320 --> 03:49:54.680]  are doing these crimes it's obviously. Basically if a criminal believes that if he breaks into
[03:49:54.680 --> 03:49:58.040]  a house he's going to get shot he'll think twice and therefore not probably not do it
[03:49:58.040 --> 03:50:03.560]  unless he's certifiably mad. If he knows that everyone's disarmed he's got three pickings
[03:50:03.560 --> 03:50:08.840]  isn't it. That's right and there is a mainstream story that was going around in New Zealand
[03:50:08.840 --> 03:50:14.240]  that the tick tock and the adrenaline rush is actually what is behind a lot of these
[03:50:14.240 --> 03:50:18.800]  ram raids here in New Zealand it's young people they are ramming cars into you know
[03:50:18.800 --> 03:50:22.720]  jewelry stores and other stores with high value items kind of like what we're seeing
[03:50:22.720 --> 03:50:28.040]  in the US where people are just you know these anti-far types that are just basically going
[03:50:28.040 --> 03:50:33.400]  into stores taking what they want knowing that they won't actually be there won't be
[03:50:33.400 --> 03:50:37.600]  serious consequences. And a lot of the criminal organisations are using young people because
[03:50:37.600 --> 03:50:41.120]  they don't actually face criminal charges as adults but therefore it's usually just
[03:50:41.120 --> 03:50:47.040]  youth court clap on the hand and get back on. Yes and of course Calvin the climate change
[03:50:47.040 --> 03:50:50.600]  narrative is rolling out as well and many of you will have heard last year here in New
[03:50:50.600 --> 03:50:58.600]  Zealand that the New Zealand government wants to tax farmers for the flatulence that these
[03:50:58.600 --> 03:51:03.680]  cows are emitting and of course it is just ridiculous I think they want to reduce dairy
[03:51:03.680 --> 03:51:09.400]  farming by about 14 percent and we have image 12 there as a headline the CNN headline it
[03:51:09.400 --> 03:51:14.920]  actually that story went around the world and then of course we've got these 20 minute
[03:51:14.920 --> 03:51:18.200]  cities as well Calvin what do you want to say about that?
[03:51:18.200 --> 03:51:23.280]  Basically what's going to happen is you think hunger games, districting, having to have
[03:51:23.280 --> 03:51:27.320]  permission to leave the area much like we did with the lockdowns just to get everyone
[03:51:27.320 --> 03:51:31.920]  used to being petitioned off from their family and friends it's just an ongoing thing it's
[03:51:31.920 --> 03:51:37.960]  not about health it's completely about control. Info wars and Alex Jones has been pushing
[03:51:37.960 --> 03:51:42.720]  this and telling you for years what's coming and here it is on our doorstep and yet because
[03:51:42.720 --> 03:51:48.680]  there's so many battle fronts everyone are fighting different symptoms of this main disease
[03:51:48.680 --> 03:51:53.800]  and the main disease is control of humanity and transhumanism is their angle.
[03:51:53.800 --> 03:51:57.960]  Definitely and another way they've been doing that here in New Zealand Calvin is three waters
[03:51:57.960 --> 03:52:04.720]  where they are here in New Zealand we have councils which regulate local areas and local
[03:52:04.720 --> 03:52:11.800]  communities and things like water and other amenities have been administered by our local
[03:52:11.800 --> 03:52:17.560]  councils and now the government is nationalising that even further and they actually want to
[03:52:17.560 --> 03:52:23.840]  take control of that and what we're seeing also is a division here based on race Calvin.
[03:52:23.840 --> 03:52:28.880]  It's an apartheid system where they're trying to say okay those that we are calling the
[03:52:28.880 --> 03:52:33.440]  native population you are now going to control all aspects of water it's not just three waters
[03:52:33.440 --> 03:52:37.920]  there's actually five different types of waters that everything from lakes rivers what comes
[03:52:37.920 --> 03:52:44.480]  out of your tap people walk across the sky sewage sewage the lot only it is not benefiting
[03:52:44.480 --> 03:52:50.040]  the average mouldy over here at all it's only the iwi's the iwi elite which is corporate
[03:52:50.040 --> 03:52:56.040]  bodies which is a crown entity anyway and anything but name only and of course that
[03:52:56.040 --> 03:53:02.560]  also ties back to the UN with the indigenous peoples act and the legislation around that
[03:53:02.560 --> 03:53:09.080]  where they are literally here in New Zealand dividing our country again on race based on
[03:53:09.080 --> 03:53:15.520]  the Treaty of Waitangi Act 1972 because if they can divide us the Treaty of Waitangi
[03:53:15.520 --> 03:53:22.920]  Act 1975 it basically was a fraud an absolute fraud but we forensically approved it on
[03:53:22.920 --> 03:53:26.560]  the counter spin episode but the government doesn't like to acknowledge that because
[03:53:26.560 --> 03:53:30.440]  they have an agenda they have their foot on the gas they're not taking it off for anyone
[03:53:30.440 --> 03:53:35.080]  or the submissions or the phone calls or the protests no matter what you do it is coming
[03:53:35.080 --> 03:53:40.480]  anyway there has to be another way around it and we've been saying do your own as Guy
[03:53:40.480 --> 03:53:45.440]  said get back to basics get back to local community get back to that strong family because that
[03:53:45.440 --> 03:53:51.800]  is what they want to obfuscate that's right and of course internationally the World Economic
[03:53:51.800 --> 03:53:58.560]  Forum Davos meetings are happening next week and you can go and check out their website
[03:53:58.560 --> 03:54:03.960]  there and actually go online and watch their streaming coverage now it is really important
[03:54:03.960 --> 03:54:08.760]  that people all around the world start watching this and waking themselves up to what is getting
[03:54:08.760 --> 03:54:15.640]  rolled out because as you will know problem reaction solution these people who already
[03:54:15.640 --> 03:54:20.720]  are the basically the technocratic bureaucrats of the world Klaus Schwab unelected officials
[03:54:20.720 --> 03:54:25.120]  already have their solutions in place which is the smart cities which is taking away our
[03:54:25.120 --> 03:54:30.440]  freedoms removing the farmers off the land bringing in the fake food that's grown in
[03:54:30.440 --> 03:54:36.320]  the lab and they will create these disasters and they will create a living crisis this
[03:54:36.320 --> 03:54:40.520]  is what they're going to be talking about they will create famine they will create disease
[03:54:40.520 --> 03:54:44.800]  and our former Prime Minister Helen Clark gave a lecture about this two years ago and
[03:54:44.800 --> 03:54:49.160]  she said that this is all coming and it's not by accident it's all by design.
[03:54:49.160 --> 03:54:56.400]  Engineering and completely destroying your lands I mean the 1080 drops banned in most
[03:54:56.400 --> 03:55:00.720]  country but dropped here love to poison the food chain because where does that end up
[03:55:00.720 --> 03:55:05.320]  into the animals and into you it's just a constant attack on your body well and that's
[03:55:05.320 --> 03:55:09.640]  another thing with the guns going they don't want hunters to be able to go out into the
[03:55:09.640 --> 03:55:15.960]  land and actually you know go and find some deer or some goat here in New Zealand so they
[03:55:15.960 --> 03:55:19.880]  are poisoning this country killing off the bird life all because they're saying they
[03:55:19.880 --> 03:55:26.120]  want to control possums and again little old New Zealand a backwater where a lot of these
[03:55:26.120 --> 03:55:31.200]  policies are tested we are the lab rats of the world many times and we have to also
[03:55:31.200 --> 03:55:35.560]  with our cousins across the ditch Australia of course they had some of the worst lockdowns
[03:55:35.560 --> 03:55:40.200]  we possibly had the second worst because we have always been tested on and if we buy it
[03:55:40.200 --> 03:55:44.440]  they farm it out to the rest of the world so sorry guys it's actually our fault you guys
[03:55:44.440 --> 03:55:49.880]  are getting such tyranny later your feet over here as well there's been an attack on our
[03:55:49.880 --> 03:55:54.160]  energy independent like in the US funny that again if I said if you notice June seeing
[03:55:54.160 --> 03:55:59.320]  along with the Marsden point shut down our only oil refinery we have enough oil in our
[03:55:59.320 --> 03:56:06.040]  great south basin alone to be energy independent for centuries centuries we have amazing gas
[03:56:06.040 --> 03:56:14.680]  but they want to regulate it all make it scarce or seemingly scarce oil is the next biggest
[03:56:14.680 --> 03:56:18.920]  on the earth next to water most prevalent next to water and the earth generates it so
[03:56:18.920 --> 03:56:23.640]  it's not a scarcity there's no people it's not going to run out it's a fabricated lie
[03:56:23.640 --> 03:56:28.160]  so if you want to check out more on that information over here on the Marsden attack go look at
[03:56:28.160 --> 03:56:31.800]  digging at Marsden and of course operation good oil both of those groups doing amazing
[03:56:31.800 --> 03:56:36.360]  jobs at bringing that subject to life here and now but just before we wrap it up we want
[03:56:36.360 --> 03:56:41.480]  to bring your attention to this a new dawn magazine it is actually an Australian publication
[03:56:41.480 --> 03:56:46.760]  and that was censored last week off the shelves here in New Zealand all because they told the
[03:56:46.760 --> 03:56:54.040]  story of the the strange story of Brenton Tarrant and he of course is the Christchurch shooter
[03:56:54.040 --> 03:56:59.480]  he is in jail three Brendan Tarrants and the one they've gotten inside at the moment who
[03:56:59.480 --> 03:57:05.560]  pleaded guilty who is now challenging that guilty leaf because they tortured and coerced him he
[03:57:05.560 --> 03:57:12.440]  says he's got the IQ of a rock yes he's like Christchurch was New Zealand's poor Arthur Massacre
[03:57:13.240 --> 03:57:17.480]  so that that is showing you that Whitkill is one of our biggest stationary shops has taken
