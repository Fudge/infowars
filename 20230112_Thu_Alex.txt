[00:00:01.067 --> 00:00:07.130]  The anniversary of January 6th has come and gone, but it's turning out to be a holiday of propaganda for the state.
[00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:10.932]  A day to celebrate lie upon lie in the corrupt Washington, D.C.
[00:00:10.932 --> 00:00:13.713]  establishment's gaslighting of America.
[00:00:13.713 --> 00:00:20.997]  As a result of the events on January 6th, the lives of five heroic officers were lost.
[00:00:20.997 --> 00:00:22.438]  Brian Sicknick was a U.S.
[00:00:22.438 --> 00:00:25.939]  Capitol Police officer devoted to serving our nation.
[00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:28.761]  He lost his life protecting our elected representatives.
[00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:32.161]  No police officers were killed on January 6th.
[00:00:32.161 --> 00:00:33.082]  Period.
[00:00:33.082 --> 00:00:35.563]  Ashley Babbitt was killed on January 6th.
[00:00:35.563 --> 00:00:39.705]  Two years later, the real evidence is still hidden from public view.
[00:00:39.705 --> 00:00:46.708]  Based on what I saw and observed in the video clip, Ashley Babbitt was murdered.
[00:00:46.708 --> 00:00:52.631]  She was shot and killed under color of authority by an officer who violated not only the law, but his oath.
[00:00:53.331 --> 00:00:55.533]  And committed an arrestable offense.
[00:00:55.533 --> 00:01:09.546]  Victoria White from Rochester, Minnesota, with the crowd had come up to the tunnel entrance and she says she had been pushed in by the momentum of the crowd and she ended up being trapped against one of the walls.
[00:01:09.546 --> 00:01:15.591]  In a fairly short time after she got in there, she was attacked by a police officer.
[00:01:15.791 --> 00:01:22.076]  A supervisor from the Metro DC Police Department and it went on for maybe five minutes.
[00:01:22.076 --> 00:01:25.398]  She was struck nearly 40 times in the head and face.
[00:01:25.398 --> 00:01:32.143]  It is definitely a crime that was committed by Officer Morris when she struck a downed person.
[00:01:32.143 --> 00:01:38.588]  She was seriously attempting to injure Roseanne Boylan by striking her.
[00:01:38.588 --> 00:01:39.889]  But they pulled her into the Capitol.
[00:01:40.089 --> 00:01:44.310]  Then she did receive emergency care, and I think heroic care.
[00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.691]  The officers that were inside didn't hesitate.
[00:01:46.691 --> 00:01:50.112]  Unfortunately, we're pretty sure she was deceased by that time.
[00:01:50.112 --> 00:02:00.234]  The Capitol Police, per their own timeline, received the authorization request from the Department of Defense, where I was Chief of Staff for National Guardsmen and Women, before January 6th.
[00:02:00.234 --> 00:02:06.036]  The Capitol Police then went to the Sergeant-at-Arms in the House and the Senate and the Chief of Police
[00:02:06.616 --> 00:02:11.338]  And the decision was made, present from their own timeline, that that request would be declined.
[00:02:11.338 --> 00:02:19.383]  And key players in the staged insurrection with ties to the federal government and its Mockingbird media arm are still walking free.
[00:02:19.383 --> 00:02:23.965]  The names Ray Epps, Megan Paradise, Luke Phillips, John Sullivan.
[00:02:23.965 --> 00:02:29.968]  Sullivan's brother, James, turned John into the FBI after he had previously been released.
[00:02:30.208 --> 00:02:36.072]  James explained to the FBI that he believed his brother was not only involved in the riots at the U.S.
[00:02:36.072 --> 00:02:40.356]  Capitol, but was somehow in charge of the breach into the U.S.
[00:02:40.356 --> 00:02:40.916]  Capitol.
[00:02:40.916 --> 00:02:46.060]  That populist counter-revolution propagandized as far-right extremism
[00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:58.283]  Has been spreading worldwide for years, just as the Biden administration's totalitarianism is spreading to world leaders as it's propagandized as homeland security.
[00:02:58.283 --> 00:03:09.465]  The overwhelming majority of people in Brazil know that the recent presidential election was stolen by the convicted criminal president Lula, convicted of corruption roughly six years ago.
[00:03:09.745 --> 00:03:16.331]  President Lula is actually a convicted felon for bribery, as well as being a socialist.
[00:03:16.331 --> 00:03:20.674]  So you have half the country that feels severely disenfranchised.
[00:03:20.674 --> 00:03:22.856]  This election had no transparency.
[00:03:22.856 --> 00:03:27.900]  So the protesters who protested for the last 70 days, peacefully, no arson, no violence,
[00:03:28.741 --> 00:03:33.304]  Just wanted a evidence proof that this was an honest election.
[00:03:33.304 --> 00:03:46.893]  Now it turns out, as the plot usually does thicken in these situations, that there were many an agent provocateur yesterday at these buildings and doing incredible gross damage, breaking windows and such.
[00:03:46.893 --> 00:03:53.497]  And it looks like this is turning into a Reichstag fire and being used to clamp down on these democratic protests.
[00:03:53.757 --> 00:04:07.027]  Mirroring the aftermath of January 6th, Lula is of course blaming former President Bolsonaro, calling him a genocidist that encouraged the protesters who swarmed all three branches of government.
[00:04:07.027 --> 00:04:16.014]  Back here in the United States, the audacity of the arrest of Ashley Babbitt's mother, who was simply honoring her daughter who was murdered by the state,
[00:04:16.434 --> 00:04:23.077]  With no charges filed, continues to spotlight the O'Biden administration's road to tyranny.
[00:04:23.077 --> 00:04:33.141]  The right to protest, as it is deemed in our constitution, clearly belongs to one class of people in America, and it ain't most of us.
[00:04:33.141 --> 00:04:42.425]  We came here to the Trump International Hotel to remind those uggos that stormed the Capitol that they're still ugly.
[00:04:42.425 --> 00:04:45.787]  And we're reminding them with just how hot we are.
[00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:47.484]  Sexy baby!
[00:04:52.071 --> 00:04:58.957]  The establishment, without a shred of doubt, are precisely the people the founders warned us about.
[00:04:58.957 --> 00:05:00.999]  And they know it.
[00:05:00.999 --> 00:05:07.184]  Everyone watching should realize that this is an information war and it takes money to fund an information war.
[00:05:07.184 --> 00:05:19.714]  And everyone should decide to take the fight to the next level and to take the fight to the very tip of the spear and ensure we stay in the field in this war against the new world order by visiting InfoWarsTore.com right now and taking action.
[00:05:20.134 --> 00:05:29.458]  I thank you for your past support, and I ask you now to count the cost and realize that only your commitment to keep InfoWars on the air will ensure our victory against the New World Order.
[00:05:29.458 --> 00:05:30.918]  They're coming for you and your family.
[00:05:30.918 --> 00:05:32.179]  They're coming for me.
[00:05:32.179 --> 00:05:33.399]  They're coming for the children.
[00:05:33.399 --> 00:05:35.980]  But to get to the children, they've got to get through us first.
[00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:39.361]  These monsters are all over television, wanting to give these shots to newborn babies.
[00:05:39.361 --> 00:05:40.662]  They're already giving them to pregnant women.
[00:05:40.902 --> 00:05:42.523]  Miscarriages are off the chart.
[00:05:42.523 --> 00:05:48.425]  80-plus percent increase in miscarriages in the first two trimesters after these poison shots.
[00:05:48.425 --> 00:05:52.346]  We can and will save the children, and they are counting on us.
[00:05:52.346 --> 00:05:53.567]  Let's do it together.
[00:05:53.567 --> 00:05:55.847]  And the fight starts at InfoWars.com.
[00:05:55.847 --> 00:05:59.669]  And the fight continues with your financial support at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:05:59.669 --> 00:06:04.410]  Now take action now!
[00:06:04.410 --> 00:06:08.352]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com Frontline Report.
[00:06:10.968 --> 00:06:22.500]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:31.150]  From deep in the heart of FEMA Region 6, Austin, Texas, transmitting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:06:32.641 --> 00:06:35.802]  MTG is set to join us coming up in the next segment.
[00:06:35.802 --> 00:06:39.143]  Criminal investigations are being launched around the world about the poison shots.
[00:06:39.143 --> 00:06:44.685]  Now the FDA has released the documents admitting it's causing mass heart attacks and cardiovascular crises.
[00:06:44.685 --> 00:06:46.845]  Here's a promo Joe Rogan sent me yesterday.
[00:06:46.845 --> 00:06:51.767]  It's a little satire piece, but it's very, very sick when you realize how real this is.
[00:06:51.767 --> 00:06:58.309]  Are you suffering from a medical coincidence?
[00:06:58.309 --> 00:07:01.290]  Are you or a loved one suffering from a medical coincidence?
[00:07:03.669 --> 00:07:10.974]  You want proper medical care, but you don't want people sniffing around asking a whole bunch of questions about what might be causing your problem.
[00:07:10.974 --> 00:07:16.118]  At the Kauffman Institute for Coincidence, we won't look into the cause of your heart or other problem.
[00:07:16.118 --> 00:07:17.419]  We'll just fix it.
[00:07:17.419 --> 00:07:18.259]  That's right.
[00:07:18.259 --> 00:07:20.661]  We promise to only look at your symptoms.
[00:07:20.661 --> 00:07:26.865]  We won't get all curious looking for causes, because that could get your employer or your doctor into some legal hot water.
[00:07:26.865 --> 00:07:27.806]  And nobody wants that.
[00:07:29.017 --> 00:07:33.681]  At Kauffman, we understand that coincidence is now the leading cause of death.
[00:07:33.681 --> 00:07:35.942]  Hey, we've got another coincidence over here!
[00:07:35.942 --> 00:07:40.665]  If we want to operate at the speed of science, there's no time for looking for causes.
[00:07:40.665 --> 00:07:43.848]  No pesky questions about drugs or vaccines you may have been given.
[00:07:43.848 --> 00:07:49.872]  At Kauffman, we specialize in the effects and leave the causes to the conspiracy theorists.
[00:07:49.872 --> 00:07:52.494]  And let's be honest, we know the cause anyway.
[00:07:52.494 --> 00:07:53.815]  It was a coincidence, right?
[00:07:54.790 --> 00:08:05.113]  For each new patient, Kauffman's talented team of doctors strap on their blinders and look directly at the problem area, usually the heart, just like the CDC recommends.
[00:08:05.113 --> 00:08:21.317]  Our main campus now treats myocarditis, blood clots, heart arrhythmia, stroke, heart attack, magnetic skin, difficulty breathing, full body blisters and burning, convulsions, kidney failure, memory loss, cancer, sudden death, and much, much more.
[00:08:22.157 --> 00:08:26.801]  Give your coincidence the attention it deserves, but not the wrong kind of attention.
[00:08:26.801 --> 00:08:27.502]  At Kauffman.
[00:08:27.502 --> 00:08:43.756]  Schedule your appointment today at KauffmanCoincidence.com and receive a doctor's note with a real science-y sounding explanation to provide to your anti-vax friends, proving to them it was definitely not the vaccine that caused your coincidence.
[00:08:43.756 --> 00:08:44.536]  Kauffman.
[00:08:44.536 --> 00:08:47.539]  Because coincidence has happened pretty much all the time.
[00:08:51.974 --> 00:09:00.237]  And those coincidences are killing an extra 13% death rate compared to the years previous.
[00:09:00.237 --> 00:09:07.359]  The highest increase in death rate the planet's ever seen by massive numbers.
[00:09:07.359 --> 00:09:11.381]  Thank you for joining us on this live Thursday, January 12th transmission.
[00:09:13.852 --> 00:09:18.333]  MTG's been scheduled twice this week but had to move it because of all the voting going on.
[00:09:18.333 --> 00:09:22.614]  But they're set to let out Congress early in just the next few minutes.
[00:09:22.614 --> 00:09:25.154]  She should be on with us a little bit later in the hour.
[00:09:25.154 --> 00:09:37.817]  She's calling for criminal investigations and criminal hearings into the criminal launch of this bioweapon and the gain of function and the origin of the virus in the Fauci, Bill Gates, Peter Daszak labs.
[00:09:39.827 --> 00:09:45.030]  We're going to be drilling through all that with her coming up in so much more.
[00:09:45.030 --> 00:09:49.894]  The FDA got a law passed in December.
[00:09:49.894 --> 00:09:51.014]  No more animal testing.
[00:09:51.014 --> 00:09:52.735]  And I told you that was coming.
[00:09:52.735 --> 00:09:56.658]  They'll just take drugs directly to market, including these poison shots.
[00:09:56.658 --> 00:10:07.285]  And then, it's all a coincidence, because no studies are done, no studies will be done, by the government and corporations, and they think the media will then just cover it up.
[00:10:08.547 --> 00:10:11.613]  This is mass depopulation.
[00:10:11.613 --> 00:10:14.038]  Then we have another big piece of legislation.
[00:10:14.038 --> 00:10:17.886]  210 Democrats vote against a bill requiring medical care for babies born alive.
[00:10:19.264 --> 00:10:24.385]  After an abortion attempt, so infanticide that they're pushing to basically keep legal.
[00:10:24.385 --> 00:10:25.706]  They've been doing it by fiat.
[00:10:25.706 --> 00:10:27.086]  That's all coming up.
[00:10:27.086 --> 00:10:29.446]  Huge news on the economy.
[00:10:29.446 --> 00:10:31.307]  Huge news on the military front.
[00:10:31.307 --> 00:10:34.628]  Huge news on the Evaldi shooting front.
[00:10:34.628 --> 00:10:40.229]  Massive news on the imminent announcement of banning gas stoves and more.
[00:10:41.417 --> 00:10:43.298]  New York's introduced legislation to do it.
[00:10:43.298 --> 00:10:44.338]  Biden's moving forward with it.
[00:10:44.338 --> 00:10:48.239]  This is the total shut off of all of our industry and siege.
[00:10:48.239 --> 00:10:48.859]  That's coming up.
[00:10:48.859 --> 00:10:50.520]  But first, Harrison Smith's done it again.
[00:10:50.520 --> 00:10:53.941]  The full video is on InfoWars.com.
[00:10:53.941 --> 00:10:56.342]  Watch the Ukraine war pitch meeting.
[00:10:56.342 --> 00:10:56.702]  Here it is.
[00:10:59.107 --> 00:11:01.669]  What are you doing over there?
[00:11:01.669 --> 00:11:02.230]  What?
[00:11:02.230 --> 00:11:04.031]  Nothing, nothing.
[00:11:04.031 --> 00:11:04.912]  Where?
[00:11:04.912 --> 00:11:05.452]  In Ukraine.
[00:11:05.452 --> 00:11:07.174]  What are you up to?
[00:11:07.174 --> 00:11:07.974]  Ukraine?
[00:11:07.974 --> 00:11:09.075]  What?
[00:11:09.075 --> 00:11:09.636]  Ukraine?
[00:11:09.636 --> 00:11:11.517]  Nothing's happening in Ukraine.
[00:11:11.517 --> 00:11:13.239]  Ukraine of all places.
[00:11:13.239 --> 00:11:14.540]  Where do you get this stuff?
[00:11:14.540 --> 00:11:20.285]  It looks like there's some sort of NATO expansion and a CIA-backed coup and something about Joe Biden withholding a billion dollars.
[00:11:20.285 --> 00:11:21.586]  You want to get impeached?
[00:11:21.586 --> 00:11:22.247]  Impeached?
[00:11:22.867 --> 00:11:24.287]  You can't impeach me.
[00:11:24.287 --> 00:11:25.728]  In that case, just shut up.
[00:11:25.728 --> 00:11:26.848]  No, no, I'm not kidding.
[00:11:26.848 --> 00:11:29.109]  It looks like Russia is massing on the border.
[00:11:29.109 --> 00:11:29.629]  Well, it's fine.
[00:11:29.629 --> 00:11:31.369]  We're sending Anthony Blinken over there.
[00:11:31.369 --> 00:11:32.510]  Oh, to prevent a war?
[00:11:32.510 --> 00:11:33.590]  No.
[00:11:33.590 --> 00:11:34.810]  Okay, well, what's he doing?
[00:11:34.810 --> 00:11:38.091]  He's going over to protect democracy.
[00:11:38.091 --> 00:11:38.792]  Oh, democracy.
[00:11:38.792 --> 00:11:40.312]  I love that word.
[00:11:40.312 --> 00:11:41.592]  Terrible news.
[00:11:41.592 --> 00:11:42.673]  Oh, no.
[00:11:42.673 --> 00:11:44.433]  Russia invaded Ukraine.
[00:11:44.433 --> 00:11:44.773]  Oh, no.
[00:11:44.773 --> 00:11:45.113]  Why?
[00:11:45.113 --> 00:11:47.214]  Well, because Vladimir Putin is evil, so...
[00:11:48.473 --> 00:11:49.694]  Because Putin's evil?
[00:11:49.694 --> 00:11:50.414]  Putin evil?
[00:11:50.414 --> 00:11:51.175]  Zelensky good.
[00:11:51.175 --> 00:11:52.215]  That about sums it up.
[00:11:52.215 --> 00:11:59.380]  Okay, so the largest country in the world decided to invade a country the size of Texas, and the only reason you're giving me is Putin evil?
[00:11:59.380 --> 00:12:01.662]  Big country, little country, you get it.
[00:12:01.662 --> 00:12:02.682]  I'm confused.
[00:12:02.682 --> 00:12:07.646]  Well, you don't like the fact that a bigger country invaded a smaller country, do you?
[00:12:08.286 --> 00:12:09.287]  No, I mean, I guess not.
[00:12:09.287 --> 00:12:10.388]  Great, you're fully on board.
[00:12:10.388 --> 00:12:11.869]  Here's the Ukrainian flag.
[00:12:11.869 --> 00:12:13.831]  Hey, have you heard about the ghost of Kiev?
[00:12:13.831 --> 00:12:15.233]  He's this lone fighter pilot.
[00:12:15.233 --> 00:12:16.314]  It's protecting the whole city.
[00:12:16.314 --> 00:12:18.395]  He's already downed, like, six Russian airplanes.
[00:12:18.395 --> 00:12:19.136]  It's incredible.
[00:12:19.136 --> 00:12:20.758]  Whoa, really?
[00:12:20.758 --> 00:12:22.059]  No, no.
[00:12:22.059 --> 00:12:23.800]  But there are these guys on Snake Island.
[00:12:23.800 --> 00:12:28.465]  When the Russians demanded they surrender, they responded, go f*** yourself!
[00:12:28.465 --> 00:12:29.566]  It's awesome.
[00:12:29.566 --> 00:12:30.587]  Whoa, really?
[00:12:31.656 --> 00:12:32.616]  No.
[00:12:32.616 --> 00:12:33.556]  No, that didn't happen either.
[00:12:33.556 --> 00:12:35.797]  But did you hear about the Russian atrocities?
[00:12:35.797 --> 00:12:38.477]  They are committing war crimes against children.
[00:12:38.477 --> 00:12:40.438]  Oh my God, really?
[00:12:40.438 --> 00:12:41.118]  Nope!
[00:12:41.118 --> 00:12:43.478]  But it doesn't matter, because we have to defend Ukraine.
[00:12:43.478 --> 00:12:45.059]  They are our military ally.
[00:12:45.059 --> 00:12:48.199]  I don't actually think they are.
[00:12:48.199 --> 00:12:52.060]  Yeah, well, we're gonna do it anyway, because after all, we've got to defend democracy.
[00:12:52.060 --> 00:12:53.440]  Okay, so what are we doing to help?
[00:12:53.440 --> 00:12:54.540]  I mean, can we mediate?
[00:12:54.540 --> 00:12:55.701]  We can call for peace?
[00:12:55.701 --> 00:12:57.421]  How many zeros is in a hundred billion?
[00:12:58.186 --> 00:13:00.808]  You're writing them a hundred billion dollar check?
[00:13:00.808 --> 00:13:06.093]  Yeah, I mean I was writing checks in the tens of millions, but I was running out of checks, so I'll just do one big one.
[00:13:06.093 --> 00:13:07.314]  How much have you sent them?
[00:13:07.314 --> 00:13:09.136]  You mean how much have you sent them?
[00:13:09.136 --> 00:13:09.676]  No idea.
[00:13:09.676 --> 00:13:10.917]  Literally impossible to know.
[00:13:10.917 --> 00:13:12.839]  Okay, well where's it all going?
[00:13:12.839 --> 00:13:14.941]  Again, who knows?
[00:13:14.941 --> 00:13:17.283]  Up in smoke, or whatever bombs do.
[00:13:17.283 --> 00:13:19.285]  That's so much money.
[00:13:19.285 --> 00:13:22.067]  Has there even been an official declaration of war yet?
[00:13:22.067 --> 00:13:22.948]  A what?
[00:13:24.944 --> 00:13:25.704]  Never even heard of that.
[00:13:25.704 --> 00:13:27.765]  No, there was a declaration that Putin is evil.
[00:13:27.765 --> 00:13:29.506]  I'm sure you heard me.
[00:13:29.506 --> 00:13:31.867]  Yeah, I don't know if I'm really convinced that Putin is evil.
[00:13:31.867 --> 00:13:33.927]  Well, of course Putin is evil.
[00:13:33.927 --> 00:13:37.769]  I mean, if he's not evil, why would he drive our gas prices up so high?
[00:13:37.769 --> 00:13:39.409]  Putin drove our gas prices up?
[00:13:39.409 --> 00:13:42.911]  Well, gas prices are high because of the sanctions that Putin made us put on him.
[00:13:42.911 --> 00:13:43.471]  Oh, sanctions.
[00:13:43.471 --> 00:13:44.731]  So this is hurting Russia.
[00:13:44.731 --> 00:13:46.372]  They've never been better, actually.
[00:13:46.372 --> 00:13:48.093]  Okay, well, what about our oil supply?
[00:13:48.093 --> 00:13:48.713]  No, it's awful.
[00:13:48.713 --> 00:13:51.394]  Actually, we're having to sell our strategic reserves.
[00:13:51.394 --> 00:13:52.494]  You mean use?
[00:13:52.494 --> 00:13:53.114]  No, sell.
[00:13:53.114 --> 00:13:53.915]  Sell to who?
[00:13:53.915 --> 00:13:54.215]  China!
[00:13:54.915 --> 00:13:55.976]  You know, our enemy?
[00:13:55.976 --> 00:13:59.359]  Okay, if we're having to sell our strategic reserves, like, why don't we just pump our own oil?
[00:13:59.359 --> 00:14:01.100]  Don't we have domestic production?
[00:14:01.100 --> 00:14:06.765]  Unfortunately, somebody already banned all of the pipelines and drilling permits, so can't use it.
[00:14:06.765 --> 00:14:07.806]  Yeah, that was you.
[00:14:07.806 --> 00:14:09.408]  We're going green!
[00:14:09.408 --> 00:14:10.448]  Gas prices have doubled.
[00:14:11.457 --> 00:14:12.258]  It's a transition.
[00:14:12.258 --> 00:14:13.918]  Transition into what?
[00:14:13.918 --> 00:14:15.359]  Transition for climate change.
[00:14:15.359 --> 00:14:17.040]  I thought we were talking about the war in Ukraine.
[00:14:17.040 --> 00:14:17.460]  Oh, right.
[00:14:17.460 --> 00:14:21.063]  Well, the weapons that we're giving Ukraine are extremely fuel-efficient.
[00:14:21.063 --> 00:14:24.805]  We can kill thousands for the same amount of emissions as a small SUV.
[00:14:24.805 --> 00:14:26.466]  So, progress.
[00:14:26.466 --> 00:14:28.087]  And hey, here's some good news.
[00:14:28.087 --> 00:14:30.488]  Somebody just blew up Russia's underwater pipeline.
[00:14:30.488 --> 00:14:31.749]  My God, who?
[00:14:33.035 --> 00:14:34.116]  I don't know.
[00:14:34.116 --> 00:14:35.057]  Who could it be?
[00:14:35.057 --> 00:14:36.178]  No one's gonna believe that.
[00:14:36.178 --> 00:14:37.639]  They're gonna think you did it.
[00:14:37.639 --> 00:14:38.459]  Me?
[00:14:38.459 --> 00:14:39.160]  The U.S.
[00:14:39.160 --> 00:14:40.181]  government?
[00:14:40.181 --> 00:14:41.922]  You know Russia has nukes, right?
[00:14:41.922 --> 00:14:49.188]  Like, is this game of brinksmanship really worth it?
[00:14:49.188 --> 00:14:51.169]  I'm in my bunker now!
[00:14:51.169 --> 00:14:52.390]  Pretty nice.
[00:14:52.390 --> 00:14:54.272]  What was that last question?
[00:14:54.272 --> 00:14:56.734]  I said, is it really worth this game of nuclear brinksmanship?
[00:15:01.812 --> 00:15:17.159]  We'll meet again Don't know when Don't know where But I know we'll meet again Some sunny day
[00:15:21.540 --> 00:15:49.069]  Me smiling through Just like you always do Till the blue skies drive the dark clouds far away So will you please say hello To the folks that I know Tell them I won't be long
[00:15:50.714 --> 00:15:56.520]  They'll be happy to know that you saw me go.
[00:15:56.520 --> 00:15:58.042]  I was singing...
[00:15:59.548 --> 00:16:07.110]  Like a rock thrown into a pond, your actions, even though they may seem little, have a massive ripple effect throughout time and space.
[00:16:07.110 --> 00:16:08.730]  We're actually winning the Info Award.
[00:16:08.730 --> 00:16:24.613]  And when you realize that Bandot Video has hundreds and hundreds of censored directors and investigative journalists and talk show hosts whose information is beyond incredible, hundreds of medical doctors and scientists, all of them, right now, telling the truth at Bandot Video.
[00:16:24.613 --> 00:16:26.794]  Millions of people a day visiting Bandot Video.
[00:16:27.154 --> 00:16:36.757]  But you can take that information and cause a bigger ripple effect, an amplifying effect, and make sure it gets out to your friends, your family, your neighbors, and perfect strangers.
[00:16:36.757 --> 00:16:39.298]  You are the modern Paul Reveres.
[00:16:39.298 --> 00:16:42.459]  You are what takes our information and amplifies it.
[00:16:42.459 --> 00:16:47.701]  When you decide to take action, we as a species and as a race are invincible.
[00:16:47.701 --> 00:16:55.123]  So I thank you all for your past action, and I challenge you to redouble your efforts now, because humanity and the children are counting on you.
[00:17:00.782 --> 00:17:05.366]  Why does the establishment spend so much time demonizing InfoWars?
[00:17:05.366 --> 00:17:07.688]  Attacking myself and the crew and our other hosts?
[00:17:08.464 --> 00:17:10.506]  Because they know we're pro-human.
[00:17:10.506 --> 00:17:12.227]  They know we're telling the truth.
[00:17:12.227 --> 00:17:13.788]  They know we've got their number.
[00:17:13.788 --> 00:17:18.511]  They know everything we do is about empowering humanity.
[00:17:18.511 --> 00:17:26.397]  And God gave us, through Mother Nature, incredible compounds that will supercharge our body's stamina, libido, energy, and immune systems.

[00:18:00.273 --> 00:18:03.435]  They want the planet for themselves, my friends.
[00:18:03.435 --> 00:18:06.477]  If we're so stupid, we let them tell us we deserve it.
[00:18:08.492 --> 00:18:13.396]  Except children don't deserve it, do they?
[00:18:13.396 --> 00:18:31.369]  And I looked, and behold, a pale horse, and he that sat on the horse was named Death.
[00:18:31.369 --> 00:18:37.254]  Now the translation is, I looked, and behold, a pale horse,
[00:18:39.215 --> 00:18:43.057]  And his name that sat on him was death and hell followed with him.
[00:18:43.057 --> 00:18:47.220]  The book of Revelation.
[00:18:47.220 --> 00:18:48.861]  Very serious times to be alive, folks.
[00:18:48.861 --> 00:18:50.582]  They're not just doing this as a one-off.
[00:18:50.582 --> 00:18:52.183]  This is the beginning of the rest of our lives.
[00:18:52.183 --> 00:18:53.523]  This is our fight.
[00:18:53.523 --> 00:18:54.864]  And I'm proud of humanity.
[00:18:54.864 --> 00:18:56.325]  The globalists even admit it's leaked.
[00:18:56.325 --> 00:19:00.428]  They're very upset that they're losing and that this hasn't gone the way they thought it would.

[00:20:06.536 --> 00:20:21.301]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:20:21.301 --> 00:20:30.024]  Well, she's got one of the best voting records in Congress, and she was joined by Gozer and others that have similar awesome America First
[00:20:31.155 --> 00:20:32.096]  We're good to go.
[00:20:52.934 --> 00:20:56.677]  I guess we're going to have to ask MTG that, but I love her.
[00:20:56.677 --> 00:21:00.400]  She's one of the best members of Congress, and they're already getting a lot of great stuff passed.
[00:21:00.400 --> 00:21:09.067]  She's also announced that she's going to push for investigations into pharma, into the shots, and into the origin of the virus and gain of function.
[00:21:09.067 --> 00:21:13.630]  So Congresswoman MTG, Marjorie Taylor Greene, is with us until 45 after.
[00:21:13.630 --> 00:21:16.192]  Congresswoman, thanks for making time.
[00:21:16.192 --> 00:21:17.914]  Thank you so much for having me, Alex.
[00:21:18.800 --> 00:21:19.961]  Well, I'm going to try to give you the floor.
[00:21:19.961 --> 00:21:26.967]  What do you want to tackle first, the agenda or what happened last week with McCarthy and the way forward here?
[00:21:26.967 --> 00:21:36.956]  Well, I can just make it real short and sweet and let everyone know that the person you see right now is no different than the person you've known over the past two years.
[00:21:36.956 --> 00:21:43.462]  And the reason why I didn't oppose Kevin McCarthy's speakership, because I knew there was no plan
[00:21:44.382 --> 00:21:48.684]  Against him, because no one else was truly running for Speaker.
[00:21:48.684 --> 00:21:56.447]  And I was also already on board with the agenda that he had set forth and that many of us had worked with him on.
[00:21:56.447 --> 00:22:05.271]  The great thing that people don't know about Kevin McCarthy is he has listened to us for the past two years, and he's truly listening to the American people.
[00:22:05.271 --> 00:22:10.594]  He's working with President Trump all the time on the America First agenda.
[00:22:10.594 --> 00:22:12.835]  And so I was, I'm already on board for that.
[00:22:12.835 --> 00:22:13.415]  And I have...
[00:22:13.795 --> 00:22:21.558]  I have truly hated Nancy Pelosi's speakership and watched her pass Biden's agenda.
[00:22:21.558 --> 00:22:25.219]  And for me, I just could not wait to have a Republican speaker.
[00:22:25.219 --> 00:22:27.800]  I could not wait to have the gavel.
[00:22:27.800 --> 00:22:42.485]  And I was ready to go for investigations that need to be done and ready to go for real work to undo all the awful things that Joe Biden has been able to accomplish with Nancy Pelosi and Mitch McConnell helping her in the Senate.
[00:22:43.465 --> 00:22:45.686]  So these, I was ready.
[00:22:45.686 --> 00:22:50.828]  And then I just want everybody to understand, here's something very important, and I've got both of them in my hand.
[00:22:50.828 --> 00:22:54.989]  This is the rules package, right here.
[00:22:54.989 --> 00:22:58.710]  This is the rules package that we had on January 1st.
[00:22:58.710 --> 00:23:00.311]  The date's right here at the bottom.
[00:23:00.311 --> 00:23:05.493]  And this was before we ever took the first vote for speaker.
[00:23:05.493 --> 00:23:11.815]  And in this rules package, the only thing that got changed, and here's the second rules package.
[00:23:12.555 --> 00:23:14.417]  This is on January 6th.
[00:23:14.417 --> 00:23:20.122]  This was the final day that we voted for Speaker after 15 ballots.
[00:23:20.122 --> 00:23:29.830]  The only thing changed in the rules package was the motion to vacate went from one member of Congress, I mean, I'm sorry, five members of Congress.
[00:23:29.830 --> 00:23:38.038]  It was five members in the original package on January 1st, and it went to one member on the motion to vacate on January 6th.
[00:23:38.818 --> 00:23:58.115]  So if anyone is confused and thinks that a lot changed after the big fighting they saw on television, after 15 ballots, 20 Republicans opposing Kevin McCarthy, and a lot of negotiating, nothing changed in the rules, nothing changed in writing, but...
[00:23:58.895 --> 00:24:02.177]  The motion to vacate from five members to one.
[00:24:02.177 --> 00:24:06.800]  Okay, so just to be clear, I like seeing 20 members flex their muscle.
[00:24:06.800 --> 00:24:11.803]  I like that the demonstration of power, kind of like Senator Mnuchin has been able to do a lot of good things.
[00:24:11.803 --> 00:24:18.346]  He's certainly not perfect, but he's blocked a lot of really bad things because they have a very slim majority, the Democrats do in the Senate.
[00:24:18.346 --> 00:24:22.169]  You guys can now do something similarly with the 20 people you have.
[00:24:22.169 --> 00:24:24.390]  But what you're saying is McCarthy made a deal.
[00:24:24.970 --> 00:24:27.433]  He's been sticking by it the two years you've been with him.
[00:24:27.433 --> 00:24:39.288]  He made a new deal, and so you'd already agreed, and so you're saying basically it was smoke and mirrors to act like there was a bunch of bad stuff that hadn't been done, but the truth is, you basically got the very same package that was already agreed to.
[00:24:40.680 --> 00:24:41.240]  That's right.
[00:24:41.240 --> 00:24:47.782]  It was the same package, except the one piece, the motion to vacate, went from five members to one.
[00:24:47.782 --> 00:24:58.886]  And I'll tell you, the 20 opposing McCarthy proved that five members to vacate is plenty, because 20 was stopping his ability to be Speaker after 15 ballots.
[00:24:58.886 --> 00:25:06.008]  Now, here is the good news, and this is where I do appreciate my colleagues and friends, and the 20.
[00:25:06.008 --> 00:25:06.948]  But it was all of us.
[00:25:06.948 --> 00:25:08.449]  It was our entire conference.
[00:25:08.849 --> 00:25:20.454]  We're working together and hammering out the details in our conference meetings on what our agenda would be for this conference, this Congress, and the bills we wanted to pass.
[00:25:20.454 --> 00:25:25.757]  All of that was done and agreed on before January 1st.
[00:25:25.757 --> 00:25:30.339]  But here's what I do think is important, because I've been one of the leaders, Alex,
[00:25:31.019 --> 00:25:33.941]  Fighting on the House floor for the past two years.
[00:25:33.941 --> 00:25:34.881]  Everyone knows this.
[00:25:34.881 --> 00:25:36.222]  They have watched me do it.
[00:25:36.222 --> 00:25:41.946]  I've called for roll call votes over and over again so that Congress would be on record.
[00:25:41.946 --> 00:25:44.967]  I've opposed the Democrats agenda.
[00:25:44.967 --> 00:25:54.393]  I've introduced multiple articles of impeachment on Joe Biden and Merrick Garland, co-sponsored impeachment articles for Mayorkas.
[00:25:55.094 --> 00:25:58.739]  I really do believe in fighting to make sure that we do the right thing.
[00:26:09.974 --> 00:26:13.316]  I mean, he scored a lot of points doing that, but really didn't do anything.
[00:26:13.316 --> 00:26:14.317]  So now I want to move on.
[00:26:14.317 --> 00:26:15.757]  I just wanted to get it on record.
[00:26:15.757 --> 00:26:21.181]  Most of the audience understands that, but for some that didn't or thought, well, why is Jones not mad about this?
[00:26:21.181 --> 00:26:24.042]  It's because we're going to wait and see what happens now.
[00:26:24.042 --> 00:26:28.125]  And I trust you and I trust Trump on almost every issue other than the shots.
[00:26:28.125 --> 00:26:31.347]  And so we're already seeing some really good bills getting voted on.
[00:26:31.347 --> 00:26:39.632]  Tell us now what's on the agenda in the new Congress and how the public can support you and other good members to get this through and then block Joe Biden's great reset.
[00:26:41.098 --> 00:26:42.880]  Okay, absolutely.
[00:26:42.880 --> 00:26:44.902]  Yeah, we have to block the Great Reset.
[00:26:44.902 --> 00:26:46.563]  We have to stop the globalization.
[00:26:46.563 --> 00:26:48.525]  We have to stop all of those things.
[00:26:48.525 --> 00:26:55.232]  So now, just to let everyone know so they can have confidence going forward, I want to remind everybody of one important thing.
[00:26:55.232 --> 00:26:56.033]  There's 222 members of Congress.
[00:26:56.033 --> 00:26:56.233]  It takes 218
[00:27:00.917 --> 00:27:04.438]  Republicans to pass any bill on the House floor.
[00:27:04.438 --> 00:27:13.281]  So that means that if we want to work really hard to stop something or change something, conservatives can do that in Congress, and I'm a conservative.
[00:27:13.281 --> 00:27:21.024]  And we will be working hard to make sure that our Republican conference is successful and is serving the American people and the America First agenda.
[00:27:21.024 --> 00:27:22.724]  So I want to make that very clear.
[00:27:22.724 --> 00:27:25.005]  Here's some great things that we've already gotten done this week.
[00:27:25.485 --> 00:27:31.429]  First thing we did was we defunded Joe Biden's 87,000 IRS army.
[00:27:31.429 --> 00:27:33.370]  That was the first thing we did.
[00:27:33.370 --> 00:27:40.975]  We've already established a select committee on strategic competition between the United States and China.
[00:27:40.975 --> 00:27:43.676]  So we're going to be holding China accountable.
[00:27:43.676 --> 00:27:49.720]  We've also established a select subcommittee on the weaponization of the federal government.
[00:27:50.140 --> 00:27:54.622]  As a select investigative committee of the Committee on Judiciary.
[00:27:54.622 --> 00:28:16.612]  Now this will hold FBI, DOJ accountable for how they've censored Americans, how they've gone after parents on school boards, and how they basically ignored the attacks on Justice Kavanaugh and other Supreme Court justices after the Dobbs decision, but did nothing about these Antifa activists and basically terrorists
[00:28:17.312 --> 00:28:21.353]  Firebombing and going after pregnancy resource centers.
[00:28:21.353 --> 00:28:25.054]  So we're going to be holding them accountable and these committees have been established.
[00:28:25.054 --> 00:28:30.535]  The one on China and the one on the weaponization of the government.
[00:28:30.535 --> 00:28:34.897]  So we've also done some other things and remember we've only been here a week.
[00:28:34.897 --> 00:28:40.258]  We don't even have our committee set up because that got delayed from the infighting last week.
[00:28:40.418 --> 00:28:41.919]  All right, stay right there, MTG.
[00:28:41.919 --> 00:28:42.560]  We've got to go to break.
[00:28:42.560 --> 00:28:48.185]  I'm going to come back and talk more about the agenda and more about your call for congressional hearings on what happened with the shots.
[00:28:48.185 --> 00:28:53.049]  There's a criminal investigation now going in Florida by the state, the German government, the Japanese government.
[00:28:53.049 --> 00:28:54.391]  It's happening everywhere.
[00:28:54.391 --> 00:28:58.815]  And you're the tip of the spear there in Congress, there in the House, Rand Paul in the Senate's calling for one as well.
[00:29:00.566 --> 00:29:02.388]  Infowars is winning.
[00:29:02.388 --> 00:29:04.429]  Infowars is reaching more people than ever.
[00:29:04.429 --> 00:29:07.212]  We were supposed to be off the air months and months and months ago.
[00:29:07.212 --> 00:29:09.974]  Mainstream media told you, but it's not true.
[00:29:09.974 --> 00:29:12.076]  They told you we were going to be shut down.
[00:29:12.076 --> 00:29:14.138]  They told you we owed a billion and a half dollars.
[00:29:14.138 --> 00:29:15.099]  None of that's true.
[00:29:15.099 --> 00:29:16.000]  It's all being appealed.
[00:29:16.460 --> 00:29:25.446]  They want you to think InfoWars is dead, but if you simply stand up and support InfoWars, we've got years and years of appeals, and we will not be taken off the air.
[00:29:25.446 --> 00:29:28.888]  But if they can convince you that we've been shut down, they're going to win.
[00:29:28.888 --> 00:29:31.590]  Don't let the globalists psyop you and your family.
[00:29:31.590 --> 00:29:41.477]  Go to InfoWarsHore.com and get incredible products, supplements, books, films, t-shirts, you name it, that fund the InfoWars and empower your life, and let the globalists know their psyop has not worked.
[00:29:41.937 --> 00:29:43.299]  Thanks for keeping us on the air.

[00:29:55.191 --> 00:29:57.173]  Do not let the gloveless brainwash you.

[00:30:00.333 --> 00:30:02.014]  You want to beat the New World Order?

[00:30:03.855 --> 00:30:11.941]  Well, so do I. And I've been the most effective individual in the fight against the globalists, and I've got their number, and I know how to bring them down.
[00:30:11.941 --> 00:30:16.084]  But ladies and gentlemen, I can't do it without your support.
[00:30:16.084 --> 00:30:20.647]  And the good news is, we're only under about $200,000 a month.
[00:30:20.647 --> 00:30:25.310]  The bad news is, the enemy is intensifying their attacks on every front, but I'm not going to back down.
[00:30:25.310 --> 00:30:27.332]  And I'll never give up, but I could give out.
[00:30:27.332 --> 00:30:28.733]  So please, keep me on the field.
[00:30:29.133 --> 00:30:34.356]  Keep me on the front lines against the enemy while getting great products at the same time that will empower you and your family.

[00:30:53.909 --> 00:30:56.651]  The globalists are counting on you not taking action!
[00:31:00.182 --> 00:31:02.364]  There is a war on for your mind.
[00:31:02.364 --> 00:31:04.166]  Your mind is a battlefield.
[00:31:04.166 --> 00:31:06.228]  This is an information war.
[00:31:06.228 --> 00:31:10.912]  Infowars popularized those terms more than two decades ago.
[00:31:10.912 --> 00:31:17.399]  And today, whether it's Donald Trump, or Governor DeSantis, or Dr. Robert Malone, they're all using the terms.
[00:31:17.859 --> 00:31:18.620]  We're good to go.
[00:31:39.431 --> 00:31:47.358]  But every time you donate money, every time you buy products, every time you keep us on air, you are literally, non-violently, politically, punching the New World Order in the nose.
[00:31:47.358 --> 00:31:49.680]  Punching their lies in the nose.
[00:31:49.680 --> 00:31:51.522]  We are going to defeat the New World Order.
[00:31:51.522 --> 00:31:52.643]  We're going over the top.
[00:31:52.643 --> 00:31:54.164]  But right now is the critical juncture.
[00:31:54.164 --> 00:31:57.187]  So please go to InfoWarsTore.com and donate now!
[00:32:00.333 --> 00:32:03.355]  InfoWars' secret weapon is finally here.
[00:32:03.355 --> 00:32:11.720]  It's a secret weapon for your immune system, for your stamina, for your energy, for your way of life, for your libido, and it also keeps InfoWars on the air.
[00:32:11.720 --> 00:32:21.265]  And I almost forgot, you save at least 50% on these products for what you pay for similar products or the exact same products in stores around the country.
[00:32:21.265 --> 00:32:26.728]  That's because we go right to the highest quality manufacturer in the nation that supplies some of the top names.
[00:32:26.728 --> 00:32:29.430]  They then give us the best deal out there, because the owner's a listener,
[00:32:29.670 --> 00:32:32.091]  We're able to bring it to you with massive discounts.
[00:32:32.091 --> 00:32:37.273]  You're not going to find 1000mg high quality CBD for anywhere near the price we sell it.
[00:32:37.273 --> 00:32:39.655]  You're not going to find it at 10mg or 20mg.
[00:32:39.655 --> 00:32:43.416]  You're not going to find turmeric at 95% humanoid at the price we're selling it.
[00:32:43.416 --> 00:32:46.078]  You're not going to find any of this anywhere near that.
[00:32:46.078 --> 00:32:52.180]  These similar formulas or the same formulas sell for up to 200% more than we're selling these.
[00:32:52.180 --> 00:32:56.562]  InfoWars MD, now available exclusively at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:32:56.562 --> 00:32:57.263]  A true 360 win.
[00:33:01.863 --> 00:33:13.135]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:13.135 --> 00:33:20.923]  Waging war on corruption, it's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[00:33:26.621 --> 00:33:27.281]  We're good to go.
[00:33:47.168 --> 00:34:02.604]  about what you can get to about plans to really go after the deep state not just there but also the censorship of the big intelligence agencies working with big tech we now know to surveil people not just censor them and big pharma involved with that as well.
[00:34:04.051 --> 00:34:10.295]  Yes, so on the Oversight Committee, we're going to be investigating everything people have seen come out of the Twitter files.
[00:34:10.295 --> 00:34:25.424]  This is the collaboration between the DCCC, between outside organizations, with Homeland, combined with the Biden administration, Big Tech, Twitter, this extends to Facebook, Google, YouTube.
[00:34:25.424 --> 00:34:27.665]  I mean, you know this of all people, Alex.
[00:34:27.665 --> 00:34:32.969]  The government has truly collaborated with Big Tech to censor and silence
[00:34:33.969 --> 00:34:36.730]  Taking away the First Amendment rights of Americans.
[00:34:36.730 --> 00:34:41.152]  That is going to be a huge investigation that will be happening through the Oversight Committee.
[00:34:41.152 --> 00:34:44.434]  And we cannot wait to get it ready to go.
[00:34:44.434 --> 00:34:50.797]  Other things you're going to see, there is going to be a special committee dedicated to COVID.
[00:34:50.797 --> 00:34:59.441]  And this will deal with everything from the origins of COVID, investigating the gain of function research and of how much of tax dollars went towards that.
[00:34:59.881 --> 00:35:11.189]  It will investigate the National Institute of Health, Dr. Fauci and any other employees there in the federal government that were involved with the Wuhan lab, China.
[00:35:11.189 --> 00:35:16.413]  It will investigate where people's taxpayer funds went.
[00:35:16.893 --> 00:35:16.973]  Yes.
[00:35:31.950 --> 00:35:37.956]  Unreal devastation to the American people, as well as COVID deaths all over the world.
[00:35:37.956 --> 00:35:45.483]  Think about how many senior citizens died in their nursing homes because COVID patients were put in there.
[00:35:45.483 --> 00:35:54.312]  I'm also very interested in investigating what is happening with people having suddenly this high amount of strokes, blood clots,
[00:35:55.673 --> 00:35:56.494]  Thank you so much.
[00:36:14.131 --> 00:36:19.638]  None of these things are normal and it needs to be investigated and people need to be held accountable.
[00:36:19.638 --> 00:36:24.404]  I'm very interested in the VAERS reports on the CDC.
[00:36:24.404 --> 00:36:31.794]  The amount of deaths and vaccine injuries reported in relation to the COVID-19 vaccine is staggering.
[00:36:32.354 --> 00:36:34.175]  And it isn't made up.
[00:36:34.175 --> 00:36:35.956]  It isn't false information.
[00:36:35.956 --> 00:36:37.958]  It isn't misinformation.
[00:36:37.958 --> 00:36:39.619]  It's very real.
[00:36:39.619 --> 00:36:44.322]  And I believe all of those reports need to be investigated.
[00:36:44.322 --> 00:36:47.063]  So there's a lot that needs to be done.
[00:36:47.063 --> 00:36:49.425]  As a matter of fact, so much that needs to be done.
[00:36:49.425 --> 00:36:52.167]  I just don't even know if we're going to have the time to do it.
[00:36:52.167 --> 00:36:54.348]  But we're going to put every ounce of energy
[00:36:54.688 --> 00:36:55.269]  We're good to go.
[00:37:13.090 --> 00:37:32.907]  We passed this this week that would require health care workers to provide the same level of care to babies who survive an abortion as they would to a baby that, say, was born prematurely or in an emergency situation.
[00:37:33.767 --> 00:37:41.533]  It's shocking to me, Alex, that every single Democrat voted against this, except one voted present.
[00:37:41.533 --> 00:37:42.854]  Well, that was my next point.
[00:37:42.854 --> 00:37:49.600]  I have the Fox News article, 210 Democrats vote against bill requiring medical care for babies born alive after abortion attempt.
[00:37:49.600 --> 00:37:50.881]  That is just unbelievable.
[00:37:52.085 --> 00:37:58.028]  Yeah, this just shows you how cold, heartless, and evil Democrats are.
[00:37:58.028 --> 00:38:04.672]  That they would literally vote against medical care for a baby that survived an abortion.
[00:38:04.672 --> 00:38:09.054]  A horrific attempted murder on this life.
[00:38:09.674 --> 00:38:11.755]  And the baby is still born alive.
[00:38:11.755 --> 00:38:13.875]  Democrats are voting to murder it.
[00:38:13.875 --> 00:38:15.395]  To make sure that it dies.
[00:38:15.395 --> 00:38:22.277]  To make sure that this little boy or little girl just fighting for their life after they're born.
[00:38:22.277 --> 00:38:23.957]  Democrats want them dead.
[00:38:23.957 --> 00:38:26.778]  Every single Republican voted to save their life.
[00:38:26.778 --> 00:38:27.578]  Beyond evil.
[00:38:27.578 --> 00:38:28.718]  We've only got about four minutes left.
[00:38:28.718 --> 00:38:29.698]  You've been very gracious.
[00:38:29.698 --> 00:38:31.479]  I want to run through a bunch of topics with you now.
[00:38:32.868 --> 00:38:37.250]  What do you make of Biden saying he knew nothing about the documents at his foundation at Penn State?
[00:38:37.250 --> 00:38:42.233]  Now, more documents pertaining to China, just like at Penn State.
[00:38:42.233 --> 00:38:46.334]  We know he and his son have been on the Chinese payroll, that came out on the laptop, and more.
[00:38:46.334 --> 00:38:47.395]  How smoking gun is this?
[00:38:47.395 --> 00:38:51.717]  Because as you know, a vice president cannot declassify documents, only a president can do it.
[00:38:51.717 --> 00:38:56.939]  So what Trump did was totally legal and totally normal, and now we know Biden has them at his house.
[00:38:56.939 --> 00:38:57.740]  This is insane.
[00:38:59.281 --> 00:39:06.707]  This is a very serious issue, and we're already having a lot of meetings on this, and I've been involved, and I've spoken with President Trump multiple times about it.
[00:39:06.707 --> 00:39:11.612]  The President of the United States is the only one that can declassify documents.
[00:39:11.612 --> 00:39:19.038]  The Vice President cannot declassify documents, and for Joe Biden to be in possession of classified documents, that means that he stole them.
[00:39:19.538 --> 00:39:34.511]  That he's not supposed to be in possession of those, but what we're seeing and the fact that his own staff, his own attorneys, is revealing that Joe Bide three times now, three times, they're revealing that he is in possession of classified documents.
[00:39:34.511 --> 00:39:36.433]  I think there's a lot to be said there.
[00:39:36.433 --> 00:39:39.055]  I think one question is number one,
[00:39:39.455 --> 00:39:40.236]  That's what I think it is.
[00:40:04.298 --> 00:40:04.898]  Yes.
[00:40:04.898 --> 00:40:16.646]  We already know that Hunter Biden is in a lot of trouble with his laptop, and that's another thing that we'll be doing on the Oversight Committee, is heavily investigating into Hunter Biden's laptop, into their bank accounts.
[00:40:16.646 --> 00:40:18.107]  I don't care about his drug use.
[00:40:18.107 --> 00:40:20.689]  I think it's disgusting, and it's very sad.
[00:40:20.689 --> 00:40:25.953]  But being back to the Communist Chinese, as his audio recordings are, I work for the Chinese intelligence chief.
[00:40:25.953 --> 00:40:26.893]  He's been arrested.
[00:40:26.893 --> 00:40:27.774]  What do I do, daddy?
[00:40:28.374 --> 00:40:29.395]  Another big subject.
[00:40:29.395 --> 00:40:35.797]  Biden's attacking our energy infrastructure, not just our pipelines, and taking our strategic oil reserve and selling it to China.
[00:40:35.797 --> 00:40:42.380]  Now they're set, Fox News is reporting, to try to ban all gas heaters and stoves.
[00:40:42.380 --> 00:40:45.922]  Those are incredibly clean sources of heat and energy and cooking our food.
[00:40:45.922 --> 00:40:46.802]  What are you going to do about that?
[00:40:48.024 --> 00:40:49.824]  I think it's appalling and we have to stop it.
[00:40:49.824 --> 00:41:01.147]  And I want you to know the vote that I just had an hour ago, Republicans voted to stop any of our oil and our strategic petroleum reserves to be sold to China.
[00:41:01.147 --> 00:41:03.548]  That was something that we just got done today.
[00:41:03.548 --> 00:41:07.789]  But this attack on the gas industry is appalling and it's America last.
[00:41:08.870 --> 00:41:14.635]  The government has no right to control the demand in our economy.
[00:41:14.635 --> 00:41:17.978]  And the American people, everyone demands natural gas.
[00:41:17.978 --> 00:41:21.481]  It's an easy choice between an electric stove and a gas stove.
[00:41:21.481 --> 00:41:23.362]  Everyone wants a gas stove.
[00:41:23.362 --> 00:41:24.904]  And it's not about the climate.
[00:41:24.904 --> 00:41:26.025]  They're lying about that.
[00:41:26.025 --> 00:41:26.465]  Well, that's right.
[00:41:26.465 --> 00:41:28.867]  At first they said they were going to do it, but there was a backlash.
[00:41:28.867 --> 00:41:29.948]  Now they've backed off.
[00:41:29.948 --> 00:41:30.829]  But you know what they do.
[00:41:30.829 --> 00:41:31.850]  Now they'll bring it back again.
[00:41:33.260 --> 00:41:33.981]  That's right.
[00:41:33.981 --> 00:41:37.464]  What it is, is the globalist agenda for the Green New Deal.
[00:41:37.464 --> 00:41:39.585]  And it has to be stopped, Alex.
[00:41:39.585 --> 00:41:43.749]  It's the most dangerous thing for our entire planet and all of humanity.
[00:41:43.749 --> 00:41:51.776]  Because the Green New Deal will cause more humans to die than any type of fossil fuel usage.
[00:41:52.516 --> 00:41:54.998]  In any type of climate lie.
[00:41:54.998 --> 00:41:58.220]  More people are alive today because of fossil fuels.
[00:41:58.220 --> 00:42:05.165]  More people, we have more food available to humans in any kind of... We're out of time, we've got 45 seconds.
[00:42:05.165 --> 00:42:14.472]  Will you also push for investigations of the Davos Group that brags that it's been grooming and paying off and controlling US politicians and others?
[00:42:14.472 --> 00:42:16.954]  I see that as just as big a threat as Communist China.
[00:42:16.954 --> 00:42:18.375]  What's your view in 30 seconds on that?
[00:42:19.540 --> 00:42:28.627]  Alex, I'm dedicated to the oversight and investigation into any abuse of our government and the taxpayer's funds.
[00:42:28.627 --> 00:42:30.689]  I'm dedicated to that.
[00:42:30.689 --> 00:42:32.030]  But here's another great news.
[00:42:32.030 --> 00:42:36.674]  We're kicking Eric Swalwell, Ilhan Omar, and Adam Schiff off of their committees.
[00:42:37.374 --> 00:42:40.777]  That was Kevin McCarthy's promise and he's making sure that gets done.
[00:42:40.777 --> 00:42:43.319]  I forgot that was one of the other incredible things you did.
[00:42:43.319 --> 00:42:44.720]  Two segments is not enough.
[00:42:44.720 --> 00:42:46.101]  Marjorie Taylor Greene, we love you.
[00:42:46.101 --> 00:42:46.782]  We salute you.
[00:42:46.782 --> 00:42:47.562]  Great job.
[00:42:47.562 --> 00:42:48.403]  You're such a leader.
[00:42:48.403 --> 00:42:49.504]  You're such a godsend.
[00:42:49.504 --> 00:42:51.265]  Thank you so much.
[00:42:51.265 --> 00:42:52.667]  Thank you, Alex.
[00:42:52.667 --> 00:42:55.609]  Got big news coming up on the other side, talking about Deimos.
[00:42:55.609 --> 00:42:56.149]  Stay with us.
[00:42:56.149 --> 00:42:56.750]  Wait till you hear this.
[00:42:59.810 --> 00:43:12.480]  Mark Twain, one of America's greatest writers and satirists and minds, famously said more than 150 years ago, rumors of his demise had been greatly exaggerated.
[00:43:12.480 --> 00:43:15.783]  Because the newspapers kept saying he died decades before he did die.
[00:43:16.443 --> 00:43:18.745]  And it's the same PSYOP today.
[00:43:18.745 --> 00:43:23.069]  InfoWars is more influential and more powerful than ever because of your support.
[00:43:23.069 --> 00:43:26.331]  And because the facts of what we've covered is coming true.
[00:43:26.331 --> 00:43:34.679]  But if they can convince you we've been shut down, if they can convince you that we're going away, and you stop supporting, you stop spreading the word, then they do win.
[00:43:34.679 --> 00:43:40.844]  Ladies and gentlemen, there's only one group of people that can shut down InfoWars, and that's you, the viewers and listeners.
[00:43:41.324 --> 00:43:43.265]  If you decide we're done, we're done.
[00:43:43.265 --> 00:43:50.549]  If you decide to go to InfoWarsTore.com and get supplements and books and films and t-shirts and so much more, we will stay on the air indefinitely.
[00:43:50.549 --> 00:43:51.950]  It is all in your hands.
[00:43:51.950 --> 00:43:53.291]  So thanks for your support.
[00:43:53.291 --> 00:43:54.492]  Stand up against the globalists.
[00:43:54.492 --> 00:43:57.773]  Go to InfoWarsTore.com right now and keep us on air.
[00:43:57.773 --> 00:43:59.694]  It's up to you.
[00:43:59.694 --> 00:44:05.658]  I'm Dr. Peter McCullough and it's an absolute pleasure to introduce to you The Wellness Company.
[00:44:06.969 --> 00:44:17.359]  An alternative healthcare system for this COVID and post-COVID world where trust has been lost in doctors and healthcare systems.
[00:44:17.359 --> 00:44:30.090]  This new online virtual platform is nationwide providing uncensored content, virtual appointments, laboratory testing, diagnostics, prescriptions,
[00:44:30.871 --> 00:44:31.551]  We're good to go.
[00:44:59.793 --> 00:45:11.106]  Once a tragedy reaches a level of national significance, American citizens should be allowed to basically question that event in any way that they deem fit.
[00:45:11.106 --> 00:45:13.008]  The First Amendment is unique in the world.
[00:45:13.008 --> 00:45:14.450]  That's what they want to take away.
[00:45:14.450 --> 00:45:15.952]  Your ability to speak freely.
[00:45:15.952 --> 00:45:17.674]  So they're going to go for Mike Lindell next?
[00:45:17.674 --> 00:45:18.975]  Or are they going to go for Steve Bannon?
[00:45:18.975 --> 00:45:20.357]  Or are they going to go for Tucker Carlson?
[00:45:20.777 --> 00:45:23.400]  I studied the globalists 30 years ago, but only 28 years.
[00:45:23.400 --> 00:45:25.622]  And I knew they were planning all of this.
[00:45:25.622 --> 00:45:28.004]  And I warned the public, as the modern Paul Revere.
[00:45:28.004 --> 00:45:30.026]  But I couldn't have done it without your support.
[00:45:30.026 --> 00:45:36.973]  And now, because we've been so successful warning the population of the planet, honest America, we're public enemy number one when it comes to the globalist agenda.
[00:45:37.614 --> 00:45:42.999]  That's why it's more important than ever to realize how successful InfoWars has been because of your past support.
[00:45:42.999 --> 00:45:51.947]  So I salute you and I thank you and I ask you now, at the critical juncture of the battle, to redouble your efforts by visiting InfoWarsStore.com and getting amazing products that keep us on air.
[00:45:51.947 --> 00:45:54.309]  1776 is the promo code.
[00:45:54.309 --> 00:45:58.213]  The destination is InfoWarsStore.com and I thank you all for your support.
[00:45:59.608 --> 00:46:02.630]  Look, it's not hype when you've delivered.
[00:46:02.630 --> 00:46:04.832]  And InfoWars has been the tip of spear against tyranny.
[00:46:04.832 --> 00:46:10.837]  And when it comes to the products we sell to fund our operation, they're just like our news and information.
[00:46:10.837 --> 00:46:13.739]  They are powerful and they change the world.
[00:46:13.739 --> 00:46:19.604]  The Real Red Pill Plus is one of our top sellers, but for over two years, it's been sold out because of supply chain breakdowns.
[00:46:19.604 --> 00:46:20.725]  It's finally back in stock.
[00:46:21.325 --> 00:46:22.326]  We're good to go.
[00:46:22.326 --> 00:46:23.167]  We're good to go.
[00:46:23.167 --> 00:46:23.647]  We're good to go.
[00:46:23.647 --> 00:46:24.108]  We're good to go.
[00:46:24.108 --> 00:46:24.809]  We're good to go.
[00:46:24.809 --> 00:46:25.309]  We're good to go.
[00:46:25.309 --> 00:46:26.050]  We're good to go.
[00:46:26.050 --> 00:46:26.690]  We're good to go.
[00:46:26.690 --> 00:46:27.151]  We're good to go.
[00:46:27.151 --> 00:46:27.872]  We're good to go.
[00:46:27.872 --> 00:46:28.512]  We're good to go.
[00:46:28.512 --> 00:46:29.193]  We're good to go.
[00:46:29.193 --> 00:46:30.474]  We're good to go.
[00:46:43.027 --> 00:46:52.334]  Get your real Red Pill Plus, a proprietary product nobody else has, exclusively back in stock for 50% off at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:46:52.334 --> 00:46:55.936]  This is as close as the Matrix Red Pill as you're going to get.
[00:46:55.936 --> 00:47:01.320]  Red Pill Plus, 50% off, InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:47:01.320 --> 00:47:07.225]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[00:47:11.418 --> 00:47:31.559]  Old pirates, yes they rob I Sold I to the merchant ships Minutes after they took I From the bottomless pit But my hand was made strong
[00:47:33.601 --> 00:47:36.525]  We are back live broadcasting worldwide.
[00:47:36.525 --> 00:47:43.255]  I'm going to be here until 2 o'clock today and then several great guest hosts fighting the New World Order will be hosting the fourth hour from New Zealand.
[00:47:43.255 --> 00:47:48.061]  Then at 3 o'clock central, the great Owen Schroyer takes over with the War Room.
[00:47:49.511 --> 00:47:53.918]  At 2 Central, I'm going to be on Piers Morgan's show that's a top show in the UK.
[00:47:53.918 --> 00:47:57.083]  It's also broadcast here in the US and it's online.
[00:47:57.083 --> 00:47:59.948]  When he does big interviews, they get about 10 million views on YouTube.
[00:47:59.948 --> 00:48:01.571]  I really look forward to that.
[00:48:01.571 --> 00:48:03.814]  I haven't debated Piers Morgan since
[00:48:06.668 --> 00:48:13.394]  2013, almost 10 years ago, and that was the biggest event that year in ratings-wise on CNN.
[00:48:13.394 --> 00:48:15.456]  This will be an hour-long debate.
[00:48:15.456 --> 00:48:22.923]  I'm going to be friendly and nice if he lets me talk, but if he tries to run over me, well, you know what happens.
[00:48:22.923 --> 00:48:25.325]  If you think you're getting our guns, 1776.
[00:48:25.325 --> 00:48:27.286]  If you think you're getting our free speech,
[00:48:29.222 --> 00:48:36.648]  1776 but I really want to try to have an in-depth discussion with him on a host of topics because he has a large audience.
[00:48:36.648 --> 00:48:40.891]  I'd like to warn people about the New World Order.
[00:48:40.891 --> 00:48:46.116]  So we'll put a link up today on InfoWars.com at 2 p.m.
[00:48:48.956 --> 00:48:54.181]  He wanted me on tape before, and then he wanted me on live, and I said, listen, I'll only do it live.
[00:48:54.181 --> 00:48:55.222]  So he says it'll be live.
[00:48:55.222 --> 00:48:56.463]  His show starts at 2 p.m.
[00:48:56.463 --> 00:49:09.577]  Central, so we'll have that up on the front page, streaming on Infowars.com, while the other co-host and host are doing a great job in the fourth hour today.
[00:49:10.606 --> 00:49:13.447]  And there's a bunch of other big podcasts I'm going to be on the next week.
[00:49:13.447 --> 00:49:14.087]  I'll leave it at that.
[00:49:14.087 --> 00:49:17.427]  There's going to be some other really big podcasters the next week or two.
[00:49:17.427 --> 00:49:18.788]  They're going to be in studio with us.
[00:49:18.788 --> 00:49:20.248]  I'll just leave it at that.
[00:49:20.248 --> 00:49:25.489]  But look for a lot of next level surprises here at the InfoWarp.
[00:49:25.489 --> 00:49:27.450]  Okay.
[00:49:27.450 --> 00:49:34.051]  I've got just some totally insane articles here in front of me that when you read them, you think these people are crazy.
[00:49:34.909 --> 00:49:42.378]  But they're not crazy in the way you think of a schizophrenic that thinks there's aliens in the attic.
[00:49:42.378 --> 00:49:48.065]  Or that, you know, there's a man living under their bed.
[00:49:48.843 --> 00:49:50.545]  They're crazy that they love to be evil.
[00:49:50.545 --> 00:49:52.688]  They're crazy that they think they can get away with evil.
[00:49:52.688 --> 00:49:55.111]  They're crazy that they reject God.
[00:49:55.111 --> 00:50:02.821]  But they're trying to make us crazy and trying to make us submit to any form of brainwashing and control they want.
[00:50:02.821 --> 00:50:06.305]  So I'm going to hit two big examples of that here in just a moment.
[00:50:08.700 --> 00:50:22.526]  I'm going to cover news and open the phones up in the second hour, and then we have a very well-known pastor and international television radio host who also has a large church, who's been living down on the Texas border the last few months in a tent with his wife.
[00:50:22.526 --> 00:50:27.948]  He's got some amazing footage, and he'll be joining us in the third hour to lay that out.
[00:50:27.948 --> 00:50:30.869]  But we'll be taking your calls, some in the next hour.
[00:50:30.869 --> 00:50:33.130]  I'll give that number out here at the end of the segment.
[00:50:33.130 --> 00:50:37.592]  We'll start lining you guys up to get you on air in hour number two.
[00:50:38.786 --> 00:50:47.593]  But the gaslighting that I want to hit is extremely important and it's bigger than just these two stories.
[00:50:47.593 --> 00:51:02.325]  It's an example of the mindset of the globalists who are trying to train us to accept absurdity because you'd have to be brain dead or just totally out of your mind to want to live in the world they're trying to build, the world they're trying to destroy.
[00:51:03.609 --> 00:51:11.313]  But before I do that, I want to thank the viewers for their incredible support, your prayer, your word of mouth, as well as the listeners and everybody else.
[00:51:11.313 --> 00:51:16.376]  And I want to encourage you to realize that we're sponsored by you.
[00:51:16.376 --> 00:51:19.538]  And we have been in the red for the last six months off and on.
[00:51:20.638 --> 00:51:28.423]  And I really had put the plea out for you to get great products that you already really need that really will enrich and empower your life in amazing ways.
[00:51:28.423 --> 00:51:29.844]  And it could save your life.
[00:51:29.844 --> 00:51:33.207]  You need all the vitamins, all the minerals, all the trace elements and the products we've got.
[00:51:33.207 --> 00:51:35.068]  If you don't get them from us, get them somewhere else.
[00:51:35.068 --> 00:51:37.690]  But these are the very best and they keep us on air.
[00:51:37.690 --> 00:51:40.552]  So I think we should be the place you spend your money, your hard-earned money.
[00:51:40.552 --> 00:51:43.634]  And I'm very respectful of that and very thankful.
[00:51:43.634 --> 00:51:47.817]  But I really came to you in the last week and told you we need help.
[00:51:47.817 --> 00:51:49.418]  And folks have come through.
[00:51:51.079 --> 00:52:04.213]  If people continue to buy products at InfoWare Store at the level you've been buying them in the last week, we will be out of the hole we've been in in about a month.
[00:52:04.213 --> 00:52:10.960]  It'll take a month of increased sales to dig us out of the million-plus-dollar six-month hole we're in.
[00:52:12.043 --> 00:52:26.249]  And then if those sales continue, we will then be able to successfully move forward, and we've got some great sponsors that are about to come on board in about a month that will take care of the underage, and then it won't be such a desperate situation.
[00:52:26.249 --> 00:52:28.790]  But we have the products in stock that we have in stock.
[00:52:28.790 --> 00:52:31.411]  Any order you order will be shipped to you within a day.
[00:52:31.411 --> 00:52:32.712]  These are amazing products.
[00:52:32.712 --> 00:52:33.972]  X2, X3 sold out.
[00:52:33.972 --> 00:52:40.575]  A lot of our best-selling products are sold out, and a lot of our other great products have come back in, like Real Red Pill Plus, like Down and Out Sleep Aid.
[00:52:41.175 --> 00:52:52.127]  And like the new Pain MD from InfoWars Platinum that is just incredibly powerful compounds that are healthy ways to really mitigate and deal with pain.
[00:52:52.127 --> 00:52:54.149]  People take this, they love it.
[00:52:54.149 --> 00:53:02.498]  This is a clone or a private label by us of the number one best-selling natural pain reliever on the market.
[00:53:02.498 --> 00:53:03.679]  It's very strong.

[00:53:09.773 --> 00:53:15.495]  Also, Testosterone 1776 Boost is the name I gave it.
[00:53:15.495 --> 00:53:17.456]  1776 Testosterone Boost.
[00:53:17.456 --> 00:53:29.322]  It is just a private label of the number one natural testosterone booster out there from the top pharmaceutical company that puts it out and sells it over the counter in stores for $100 a bottle.

[00:53:41.240 --> 00:53:44.742]  This costs a lot because it's got really, really good ingredients for us to get.
[00:53:44.742 --> 00:53:49.044]  And then we cut it way back from the markup you'd see in stores.
[00:53:49.044 --> 00:53:53.607]  So get 1776 testosterone boosts today at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:53:54.929 --> 00:53:56.111]  Our 888-253-3139.
[00:53:56.111 --> 00:54:01.178]  Down and Out Sleep Aid is our strongest sleep aid.
[00:54:01.178 --> 00:54:01.919]  We've got three of them.
[00:54:01.919 --> 00:54:02.920]  They're all excellent.
[00:54:02.920 --> 00:54:03.821]  This one's really strong.
[00:54:03.821 --> 00:54:04.943]  Be careful with it.
[00:54:04.943 --> 00:54:09.890]  Big doses of the valerian root and melatonin and five other ingredients.
[00:54:11.454 --> 00:54:13.296]  Deep restful sleep is so important.
[00:54:13.296 --> 00:54:14.617]  Get your down-and-out back in stock.
[00:54:14.617 --> 00:54:15.878]  40% off.
[00:54:15.878 --> 00:54:16.938]  Infowarstore.com.
[00:54:16.938 --> 00:54:19.440]  And Real Red Pill has been sold out for two-plus years.
[00:54:19.440 --> 00:54:21.622]  The real fountain of youth, folks.
[00:54:21.622 --> 00:54:23.684]  With the Preglanone and so much more.
[00:54:23.684 --> 00:54:28.448]  All associated with being healthier and slowing the aging process.
[00:54:28.448 --> 00:54:29.969]  Just overall having a better life.
[00:54:29.969 --> 00:54:30.709]  It's got everything you need.
[00:54:30.709 --> 00:54:33.071]  A bunch of proprietary ingredients.
[00:54:33.071 --> 00:54:36.034]  It's back in stock, but at current sales rates, it's going to sell out in a few weeks.
[00:54:37.452 --> 00:54:41.274]  Despite that, we need the funds in now, so it's 50% off, but it's going to sell out.
[00:54:41.274 --> 00:54:43.956]  RealRedPillPlusInfoWarStore.com.
[00:54:43.956 --> 00:54:46.937]  Okay.
[00:54:46.937 --> 00:54:50.860]  Let me start getting to this, then I'm going to hit it more next hour, and then go to your calls.
[00:54:50.860 --> 00:54:53.801]  This is such a big deal.
[00:54:53.801 --> 00:55:03.487]  Because this is happening all over the Western globalist-controlled world, similar things to this, and they do this on purpose, so it's totally absurd, so that when you accept it, you're now in a cult.
[00:55:04.321 --> 00:55:06.642]  No, it's not saying two men can have a baby.
[00:55:06.642 --> 00:55:10.143]  Or that women in a prison are having babies when it's men they're putting in prisons.
[00:55:10.143 --> 00:55:11.603]  That's all meant to be absurd as well.
[00:55:11.603 --> 00:55:16.025]  Or that carbon dioxide is poisonous when it's what plants breathe and put off oxygen.
[00:55:16.025 --> 00:55:17.545]  They've already done all that.
[00:55:17.545 --> 00:55:19.986]  And other universities have banned the word Lynch.
[00:55:19.986 --> 00:55:20.766]  Lynch Hall.
[00:55:20.766 --> 00:55:22.727]  It's an Irish last name.
[00:55:22.727 --> 00:55:25.228]  Famous Irish guy pays for Lynch Hall.
[00:55:25.228 --> 00:55:28.929]  They banned the name Lynch Hall 100 years later because Lynch might make somebody think they're going to get lynched.
[00:55:29.878 --> 00:55:36.041]  Now the University of Southern California removes the word field for being racist.
[00:55:36.041 --> 00:55:39.563]  You may not use it in the textbooks, in the articles.
[00:55:39.563 --> 00:55:41.904]  If you say it, you'll be censored.
[00:55:41.904 --> 00:55:54.671]  First it's the n-word, now it's the word field, meaning energy field, grass field, the football field, and people will now submit, it's another word they won't say.
[00:55:54.671 --> 00:55:56.932]  Kind of like the fist bump emoji.
[00:55:58.436 --> 00:56:02.781]  ...is being manned all over because the ADL says it is a white power symbol.
[00:56:02.781 --> 00:56:04.943]  They also say that the OK symbol...
[00:56:06.056 --> 00:56:07.137]  is bad.
[00:56:07.137 --> 00:56:13.159]  Again, it's about these groups controlling language, controlling symbols, and controlling what you can say and what you can do.
[00:56:13.159 --> 00:56:15.080]  These are authoritarians, extremely dangerous.
[00:56:15.080 --> 00:56:16.561]  Now, I just covered that.
[00:56:16.561 --> 00:56:23.324]  The University of Southern California has removed the word field from the curriculum and academic references because it supposedly has racist connotations.
[00:56:23.324 --> 00:56:24.345]  No, this is not the Babylon Bee.
[00:56:24.345 --> 00:56:29.988]  The university announced that the phrase such as field of study will be replaced by
[00:56:30.968 --> 00:56:32.149]  Practicum.
[00:56:32.149 --> 00:56:33.889]  See, it's all the new cult words.
[00:56:33.889 --> 00:56:36.431]  In order to advance the cause of anti-racism.
[00:56:36.431 --> 00:56:38.292]  So it's the new leftist speak.
[00:56:38.292 --> 00:56:42.914]  So they know you're following what they're saying and go along with it.
[00:56:42.914 --> 00:56:44.574]  Unbelievable.
[00:56:44.574 --> 00:56:46.175]  And it's not nonsensical.
[00:56:46.175 --> 00:56:47.556]  It's cult programming.
[00:56:47.556 --> 00:56:50.377]  Now we've got another example when we come back of this.
[00:56:50.377 --> 00:56:56.660]  Remember that member of parliament who got up and read the government statistics about heart attacks increasing from the poison shot?
[00:56:56.660 --> 00:56:58.161]  Which is all confirming by the CDC?
[00:56:59.389 --> 00:57:04.232]  He is being removed from his committee chairmanships in the UK.
[00:57:04.232 --> 00:57:18.580]  The Prime Minister is decrying him as anti-Semitic for saying the New Holocaust are these poison shots and that Dr. Mingala did unauthorized medical experiments and that this is similar to Joseph Mingala.
[00:57:18.580 --> 00:57:20.522]  It is.
[00:57:20.522 --> 00:57:24.224]  And now it's anti-Semitic if you liken it to what Hitler did.
[00:57:24.224 --> 00:57:24.404]  What?
[00:57:25.839 --> 00:57:29.102]  See, I mean, this is next level, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:57:29.102 --> 00:57:31.485]  And this is how they use political correctness for total control.
[00:57:31.485 --> 00:57:34.327]  They can carry out their real eugenics operations.
[00:57:34.327 --> 00:57:37.931]  The ADL, all these people are the real Nazis.
[00:57:37.931 --> 00:57:40.493]  They're as close to Nazis as anything I've ever seen.
[00:57:40.493 --> 00:57:42.715]  We'll be right back with hour number two straight ahead.
[00:57:42.715 --> 00:57:44.097]  InfoWars.com.
[00:57:44.097 --> 00:57:45.198]  Tomorrow's news today.
[00:57:51.092 --> 00:57:54.994]  Ladies and gentlemen, a very exciting development has just taken place.
[00:57:54.994 --> 00:58:03.880]  I want to encourage you all to go to InfoWarsTore.com and check it out for yourself, because it is a very strong, high-quality formula.
[00:58:03.880 --> 00:58:05.681]  Down-and-out sleep support.
[00:58:05.681 --> 00:58:06.462]  Liquid.
[00:58:06.462 --> 00:58:07.742]  It's very fast-acting.
[00:58:07.742 --> 00:58:08.963]  Take it under the tongue.
[00:58:08.963 --> 00:58:16.708]  It's got a very good dose of melatonin, passionflower, valerian root extract, lemon balm, and German chamomile.
[00:58:17.208 --> 00:58:23.592]  All of these compounds are documented on record to help give you deeper, cleaner, healthier sleep.
[00:58:23.592 --> 00:58:27.715]  And that is one of the biggest game changers out there with all the stress we have in this world.
[00:58:27.715 --> 00:58:30.777]  And we've got some other great sleep aids as well, and they're excellent.
[00:58:30.777 --> 00:58:32.177]  They're all different formulas.
[00:58:32.177 --> 00:58:36.280]  But this one is particularly the strongest one we have.
[00:58:36.280 --> 00:58:41.563]  So, down and out, sold out for more than five months, is now back available at InfoWareStore.com.
[00:58:41.563 --> 00:58:42.084]  So get better,
[00:58:42.924 --> 00:58:50.489]  Deeper rest, boost your immune system, and support the InfoWar with down and out sleep support at InfoWars.org.
[00:58:50.489 --> 00:58:55.013]  Introducing our new incredible supplement line, InfoWars MD.
[00:58:55.013 --> 00:59:07.461]  Now in 60 seconds, it's hard to tell you how incredible these products are, but all of these products are already sold on store shelves under other brand names for up to twice the cost we're selling it to you.
[00:59:07.461 --> 00:59:08.642]  These are high-end.
[00:59:08.642 --> 00:59:09.703]  These are the very best.
[00:59:10.023 --> 00:59:12.505]  You know our Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula is amazing?
[00:59:12.505 --> 00:59:13.026]  Well, guess what?
[00:59:13.026 --> 00:59:18.811]  We now have Turmeric 95 that's basically the same formula for a lower price.
[00:59:18.811 --> 00:59:21.433]  CBD oil of the highest quality.
[00:59:21.433 --> 00:59:28.319]  Up to 50% less than major competitors selling the exact high-quality, full-spectrum CBD.
[00:59:28.319 --> 00:59:33.523]  And it goes on for all the new InfoWars MD products at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:59:33.523 --> 00:59:34.504]  The highest quality.
[00:59:34.784 --> 00:59:43.566]  Directly from the manufacturer to your door at prices up to 50%, in some cases 100% lower than what they're sold for in stores.
[00:59:43.566 --> 00:59:53.248]  M4 Wars MD at M4WarsStore.com.
[00:59:53.248 --> 00:59:57.169]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:00:03.260 --> 01:00:07.624]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, your phone calls are coming up at 877-789-2539, 877... 877-789-2539, but first, Harrison Smith's newest report, Ukraine War Pitch.
[01:00:07.624 --> 01:00:07.764]  What a...
[01:00:20.148 --> 01:00:21.289]  What are you doing over there?
[01:00:21.289 --> 01:00:21.850]  What?
[01:00:21.850 --> 01:00:23.652]  Nothing, nothing.
[01:00:23.652 --> 01:00:24.513]  Where?
[01:00:24.513 --> 01:00:25.093]  In Ukraine.
[01:00:25.093 --> 01:00:26.795]  What are you up to?
[01:00:26.795 --> 01:00:27.616]  Ukraine?
[01:00:27.616 --> 01:00:28.717]  What?
[01:00:28.717 --> 01:00:29.278]  Ukraine?
[01:00:29.278 --> 01:00:31.160]  Nothing's happening in Ukraine.
[01:00:31.160 --> 01:00:32.862]  Ukraine of all places.
[01:00:32.862 --> 01:00:34.183]  Where do you get this stuff?
[01:00:34.183 --> 01:00:39.889]  It looks like there's some sort of NATO expansion and a CIA-backed coup and something about Joe Biden withholding a billion dollars.
[01:00:39.889 --> 01:00:41.211]  Do you want to get impeached?
[01:00:41.211 --> 01:00:41.671]  Impeached?
[01:00:42.492 --> 01:00:43.633]  You can't impeach me.
[01:00:43.633 --> 01:00:45.354]  Then, in that case, just shut up.
[01:00:45.354 --> 01:00:46.475]  No, no, I'm not kidding.
[01:00:46.475 --> 01:00:48.737]  It looks like Russia is massing on the border.
[01:00:48.737 --> 01:00:49.258]  Well, it's fine.
[01:00:49.258 --> 01:00:50.999]  We're sending Anthony Blinken over there.
[01:00:50.999 --> 01:00:52.140]  Oh, to prevent a war?
[01:00:52.140 --> 01:00:53.221]  No.
[01:00:53.221 --> 01:00:54.442]  Okay, well, what's he doing?
[01:00:54.442 --> 01:00:57.725]  He's, uh, going over to, uh, protect democracy.
[01:00:57.725 --> 01:00:58.426]  Oh, democracy.
[01:00:58.426 --> 01:00:59.967]  I love that word.
[01:00:59.967 --> 01:01:01.228]  Terrible news.
[01:01:01.228 --> 01:01:02.309]  Oh, no.
[01:01:02.309 --> 01:01:04.070]  Russia invaded Ukraine.
[01:01:04.070 --> 01:01:04.411]  Oh, no.
[01:01:04.411 --> 01:01:05.151]  Why?
[01:01:05.151 --> 01:01:06.853]  Well, because Vladimir Putin is evil, so...
[01:01:08.080 --> 01:01:09.321]  Because Putin's evil?
[01:01:09.321 --> 01:01:10.041]  Putin evil?
[01:01:10.041 --> 01:01:10.801]  Zelensky good.
[01:01:10.801 --> 01:01:11.842]  That about sums it up.
[01:01:11.842 --> 01:01:19.024]  Okay, so the largest country in the world decided to invade a country the size of Texas, and the only reason you're giving me is Putin evil?
[01:01:19.024 --> 01:01:21.285]  Big country, little country, you get it.
[01:01:21.285 --> 01:01:22.306]  I'm confused.
[01:01:22.306 --> 01:01:27.268]  Well, you don't like the fact that a bigger country invaded a smaller country, do you?
[01:01:27.928 --> 01:01:28.909]  No, I mean, I guess not.
[01:01:28.909 --> 01:01:30.011]  Great, you're fully on board.
[01:01:30.011 --> 01:01:31.492]  Here's the Ukrainian flag.
[01:01:31.492 --> 01:01:33.474]  Hey, have you heard about the ghost of Kiev?
[01:01:33.474 --> 01:01:34.856]  He's this lone fighter pilot.
[01:01:34.856 --> 01:01:35.957]  It's protecting the whole city.
[01:01:35.957 --> 01:01:38.019]  He's already downed, like, six Russian airplanes.
[01:01:38.019 --> 01:01:38.780]  It's incredible.
[01:01:38.780 --> 01:01:39.961]  Whoa, really?
[01:01:39.961 --> 01:01:41.202]  No.
[01:01:41.202 --> 01:01:41.683]  No.
[01:01:41.683 --> 01:01:43.425]  But there are these guys on Snake Island.
[01:01:43.425 --> 01:01:48.069]  When the Russians demanded they surrender, they responded, go f*** yourself!
[01:01:48.069 --> 01:01:49.191]  It's awesome.
[01:01:49.191 --> 01:01:50.232]  Whoa, really?
[01:01:51.281 --> 01:01:52.242]  No.
[01:01:52.242 --> 01:01:53.182]  No, that didn't happen either.
[01:01:53.182 --> 01:01:55.444]  But did you hear about the Russian atrocities?
[01:01:55.444 --> 01:01:58.166]  They are committing war crimes against children.
[01:01:58.166 --> 01:02:00.067]  Oh my God, really?
[01:02:00.067 --> 01:02:00.748]  Nope!
[01:02:00.748 --> 01:02:03.110]  But it doesn't matter, because we have to defend Ukraine.
[01:02:03.110 --> 01:02:04.691]  They are our military ally.
[01:02:04.691 --> 01:02:07.833]  I don't actually think they are.
[01:02:07.833 --> 01:02:11.716]  Yeah, well, we're gonna do it anyway, because after all, we've got to defend democracy.
[01:02:11.716 --> 01:02:13.077]  Okay, so what are we doing to help?
[01:02:13.077 --> 01:02:14.178]  I mean, can we mediate?
[01:02:14.178 --> 01:02:15.318]  We can call for peace?
[01:02:15.318 --> 01:02:17.080]  How many zeros is in a hundred billion?
[01:02:17.807 --> 01:02:20.449]  You're writing them a hundred billion dollar check?
[01:02:20.449 --> 01:02:25.712]  Yeah, I mean, I was writing checks in the tens of millions, but I was running out of checks, so I'll just do one big one.
[01:02:25.712 --> 01:02:26.933]  How much have you sent them?
[01:02:26.933 --> 01:02:28.775]  You mean, how much have you sent them?
[01:02:28.775 --> 01:02:29.295]  No idea.
[01:02:29.295 --> 01:02:30.536]  Literally impossible to know.
[01:02:30.536 --> 01:02:32.457]  Okay, well, where's it all going?
[01:02:32.457 --> 01:02:34.559]  Again, who knows?
[01:02:34.559 --> 01:02:36.900]  Up in smoke, or whatever bombs do.
[01:02:36.900 --> 01:02:39.082]  Okay, that's so much money.
[01:02:39.082 --> 01:02:41.703]  Has there even been an official declaration of war yet?
[01:02:41.703 --> 01:02:42.564]  A what?
[01:02:44.568 --> 01:02:45.349]  Never even heard of that.
[01:02:45.349 --> 01:02:47.390]  No, there was a declaration that Putin is evil.
[01:02:47.390 --> 01:02:49.132]  I'm sure you heard me.
[01:02:49.132 --> 01:02:51.493]  Yeah, I don't know if I'm really convinced that Putin is evil.
[01:02:51.493 --> 01:02:53.555]  Well, of course Putin is evil.
[01:02:53.555 --> 01:02:57.398]  I mean, if he's not evil, why would he drive our gas prices up so high?
[01:02:57.398 --> 01:02:59.039]  Putin drove our gas prices up?
[01:02:59.039 --> 01:03:02.562]  Well, gas prices are high because of the sanctions that Putin made us put on him.
[01:03:02.562 --> 01:03:03.102]  Oh, sanctions.
[01:03:03.102 --> 01:03:04.363]  So this is hurting Russia.
[01:03:04.363 --> 01:03:06.005]  They've never been better, actually.
[01:03:06.005 --> 01:03:07.746]  Okay, well, what about our oil supply?
[01:03:07.746 --> 01:03:08.346]  No, it's awful.
[01:03:08.346 --> 01:03:11.048]  Actually, we're having to sell our strategic reserves.
[01:03:11.048 --> 01:03:12.129]  You mean use?
[01:03:12.129 --> 01:03:12.770]  No, sell.
[01:03:12.770 --> 01:03:13.550]  Sell to who?
[01:03:13.550 --> 01:03:13.851]  China!
[01:03:14.540 --> 01:03:15.561]  You know, our enemy?
[01:03:15.561 --> 01:03:18.984]  Okay, if we're having to sell our strategic reserves, like, why don't we just pump our own oil?
[01:03:18.984 --> 01:03:20.705]  Don't we have domestic production?
[01:03:20.705 --> 01:03:26.410]  Unfortunately, somebody already banned all of the pipelines and drilling permits, so can't use it.
[01:03:26.410 --> 01:03:27.431]  Yeah, that was you.
[01:03:27.431 --> 01:03:29.033]  We're going green!
[01:03:29.033 --> 01:03:30.073]  Gas prices have doubled.
[01:03:31.081 --> 01:03:31.882]  It's a transition.
[01:03:31.882 --> 01:03:33.543]  Transition into what?
[01:03:33.543 --> 01:03:34.984]  Transition for climate change.
[01:03:34.984 --> 01:03:36.685]  I thought we were talking about the war in Ukraine.
[01:03:36.685 --> 01:03:37.086]  Oh, right.
[01:03:37.086 --> 01:03:40.688]  Well, the weapons that we're giving Ukraine are extremely fuel efficient.
[01:03:40.688 --> 01:03:44.431]  We can kill thousands for the same amount of emissions as a small SUV.
[01:03:44.431 --> 01:03:46.093]  So, progress.
[01:03:46.093 --> 01:03:47.714]  And, hey, here's some good news.
[01:03:47.714 --> 01:03:50.116]  Somebody just blew up Russia's underwater pipeline.
[01:03:50.116 --> 01:03:51.377]  My God, who?
[01:03:52.654 --> 01:03:53.755]  I don't know.
[01:03:53.755 --> 01:03:54.675]  Who could it be?
[01:03:54.675 --> 01:03:55.795]  No one's gonna believe that.
[01:03:55.795 --> 01:03:57.256]  They're gonna think you did it.
[01:03:57.256 --> 01:03:58.096]  Me?
[01:03:58.096 --> 01:03:58.797]  The U.S.
[01:03:58.797 --> 01:03:59.817]  government?
[01:03:59.817 --> 01:04:01.538]  You know Russia has nukes, right?
[01:04:01.538 --> 01:04:08.821]  Like, is this game of brinksmanship really worth it?
[01:04:08.821 --> 01:04:10.782]  I'm in my bunker now!
[01:04:10.782 --> 01:04:12.022]  Pretty nice.
[01:04:12.022 --> 01:04:13.883]  What was that last question?
[01:04:13.883 --> 01:04:16.304]  I said, is it really worth this game of nuclear brinksmanship?
[01:04:20.197 --> 01:04:23.579]  Alright folks, the full video is on InfoWars.com.
[01:04:23.579 --> 01:04:25.420]  It's going to really wake people up.
[01:04:25.420 --> 01:04:28.282]  The last two videos he did got tens of millions of views.
[01:04:28.282 --> 01:04:29.363]  Joe Rogan retweeted it.
[01:04:29.363 --> 01:04:40.090]  I'm going to send this to Joe here in just a minute, but I need all of you to go to InfoWars.com or Band.Video and get the Ukraine War Pitch Meeting and email it out, text message it out to everybody you know.
[01:04:40.090 --> 01:04:46.073]  Now Twitter still won't let you support InfoWars by spreading that link, but we have TheInfoWar.tv.
[01:04:46.073 --> 01:04:47.114]  TheInfoWar.tv
[01:04:49.075 --> 01:04:53.299]  You go there, it's Band.Video, all those URLs, they're not blocking them.
[01:04:53.299 --> 01:04:57.103]  So share the Ukraine War Pitch Meeting.
[01:05:00.501 --> 01:05:19.657]  Everyone watching should realize that this is an information war and it takes money to fund an information war and everyone should decide to take the fight to the next level and to take the fight to the very tip of the spear and ensure we stay in the field in this war against the new world order by visiting InfoWarstore.com right now and taking action.
[01:05:19.657 --> 01:05:24.601]  I thank you for your past support and I ask you now to count the cost and realize that only your commitment
[01:05:25.041 --> 01:05:26.662]  Keep InfoWars on the air.
[01:05:26.662 --> 01:05:28.964]  We'll ensure our victory against the New World Order.
[01:05:28.964 --> 01:05:30.425]  They're coming for you and your family.
[01:05:30.425 --> 01:05:31.686]  They're coming for me.
[01:05:31.686 --> 01:05:32.907]  They're coming for the children.
[01:05:32.907 --> 01:05:35.489]  But to get to the children, they've got to get through us first.
[01:05:35.489 --> 01:05:38.872]  These monsters are all over television, wanting to give these shots to newborn babies.
[01:05:38.872 --> 01:05:40.173]  They're already giving them to pregnant women.
[01:05:40.413 --> 01:05:42.494]  Miscarriages are off the chart.
[01:05:42.494 --> 01:05:47.935]  80 plus percent increase in miscarriages in the first two trimesters after these poison shots.
[01:05:47.935 --> 01:05:51.836]  We can and will save the children and they are counting on us.
[01:05:51.836 --> 01:05:53.057]  Let's do it together.
[01:05:53.057 --> 01:05:55.358]  And the fight starts at InfoWars.com.
[01:05:55.358 --> 01:05:59.179]  And the fight continues with your financial support at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:05:59.179 --> 01:06:07.441]  Now take action now!
[01:06:07.441 --> 01:06:09.442]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:06:11.718 --> 01:06:17.404]  It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[01:06:31.255 --> 01:06:34.579]  We are now into our number two broadcasting worldwide.
[01:06:34.579 --> 01:06:35.820]  We're taking your calls this hour.
[01:06:35.820 --> 01:06:36.841]  The toll-free number to join us is 877-789-2539.
[01:06:36.841 --> 01:06:36.901]  877-789-2539.
[01:06:36.901 --> 01:06:40.084]  Talk radio slash news on radio, on TV, and on the internet at infowars.com forward slash show.
[01:06:40.084 --> 01:06:40.425]  All right, so...
[01:06:54.778 --> 01:07:00.200]  I already covered last hour just one example of total brainwashing by design.
[01:07:00.200 --> 01:07:13.023]  And most of the red state and town hall articles are, oh, the crazy liberals have banned the word field, and they've banned the word brown bag, and they've banned the word lynch, even in people's last names, and two men can have a baby, and they're just idiots.
[01:07:13.023 --> 01:07:13.984]  They're morons.
[01:07:13.984 --> 01:07:16.344]  They want to ban your gas stoves because they're stupid.
[01:07:16.344 --> 01:07:18.145]  No, they want total control.
[01:07:18.145 --> 01:07:19.105]  Total enslavement.
[01:07:19.105 --> 01:07:20.806]  They admit that's their plan.
[01:07:20.806 --> 01:07:21.926]  A post-industrial world.
[01:07:22.486 --> 01:07:32.733]  So now the University of Southern California has removed the word field from their academic textbooks and from discussion and from their curriculum.
[01:07:32.733 --> 01:07:35.715]  The new word is practicum.
[01:07:35.715 --> 01:07:36.615]  That's what you're supposed to use.
[01:07:36.615 --> 01:07:39.057]  It's about a cult taking control of the language.
[01:07:39.057 --> 01:07:40.878]  Well, there's other forms of this brainwashing.
[01:07:42.293 --> 01:08:02.248]  The British government was the first to start giving the poison shots two and a half years ago and right away the federal watchdog agency there said we want to issue a yellow notice but they've blocked the law that we're the regulatory power and just given an emergency authorization but we think there should be a yellow notice meaning pull the shots.
[01:08:02.248 --> 01:08:05.771]  That was two years ago, six months after they started.
[01:08:05.771 --> 01:08:08.253]  Then they said don't give it to children, don't give it to the elderly, on and on and on.
[01:08:09.867 --> 01:08:24.058]  Now it's come out in their National Health Service and it's come out in our CDC that they knew all along and we're covering it up and now the documents from Pfizer and the CDC have all come out in the last few months, new documents just two days ago.
[01:08:24.058 --> 01:08:25.980]  And so then what came out of that?
[01:08:27.850 --> 01:08:37.615]  Well, a member of Parliament, Conservative British member of Parliament, punished and under investigation for tweet exposing COVID vaccines.
[01:08:37.615 --> 01:08:39.856]  The article's on InfoWars.com.
[01:08:39.856 --> 01:08:46.259]  United Kingdom MP Andrew Bridgen has been suspended from sitting as a Conservative MP.
[01:08:46.259 --> 01:08:49.301]  Wow, suspended, so they're nixing out the voters.
[01:08:49.301 --> 01:08:56.925]  Had his Conservative whip removed and will now serve without a party affiliation until a formal investigation is completed.
[01:08:57.918 --> 01:09:07.964]  Mr. Bridgen's crime was simply tweeting a Zero Hedge article detailing America's CDC statistics showing COVID jabs are far more dangerous than previously reported.
[01:09:07.964 --> 01:09:17.650]  Along with this article, Bridgen wrote, as one consultant cardiologist said to me, this is the biggest crime against humanity since the Holocaust.
[01:09:18.979 --> 01:09:22.900]  And so the left said, oh, he's attacking Jews, talking about the Holocaust.
[01:09:22.900 --> 01:09:26.402]  You can't use the word unless you're Jewish.
[01:09:26.402 --> 01:09:32.704]  And the Prime Minister came out and said, yes, he's an anti-Semite and a terrible man.
[01:09:32.704 --> 01:09:33.984]  None of that makes sense.
[01:09:33.984 --> 01:09:35.185]  That's insane.
[01:09:35.185 --> 01:09:35.985]  That's crazy.
[01:09:35.985 --> 01:09:39.066]  And it's meant to be insane.
[01:09:39.066 --> 01:09:46.649]  It's meant to tell you, you come out and criticize these shots and the murderers that rolled it out, we're going to destroy you.
[01:09:46.649 --> 01:09:47.429]  But here's the good news.
[01:09:48.325 --> 01:09:51.748]  This intimidation is not working.
[01:09:51.748 --> 01:09:56.773]  Here's the tweet that's getting him basically run out of Parliament.
[01:09:56.773 --> 01:10:01.278]  As one consultant cardiologist said to me, this is the biggest crime against humanity since the Holocaust.
[01:10:01.278 --> 01:10:02.579]  He's saying the Holocaust happened.
[01:10:02.579 --> 01:10:05.342]  He's saying it was a huge crime.
[01:10:05.342 --> 01:10:07.224]  Not good enough, anti-Semite.
[01:10:08.737 --> 01:10:25.085]  Matt Hancock, the disgraced UK Health Secretary, who locked the nation down during COVID, erupted at Bridgen on Wednesday, telling the Prime Minister the tweet was disgusting, anti-Semitic, I'm quoting it, anti-vax conspiracy theory that is deeply offensive and anti-Semitic.
[01:10:25.085 --> 01:10:35.951]  Prime Minister Rishi Sunak agreed with his friend Hancock and condemned the MP as unacceptable language and pledged to eradicate the scourge of anti-Semitism.
[01:10:39.807 --> 01:10:43.148]  They know what they're doing, but it's not working.
[01:10:43.148 --> 01:10:44.908]  All the information is coming out.
[01:10:44.908 --> 01:10:46.069]  But, oh, we're going to call you a racist.
[01:10:46.069 --> 01:10:49.990]  Oh, we're going to call you a Nazi.
[01:10:49.990 --> 01:10:56.912]  While they carry out policies, they're as close to the Nazis as I've seen in my lifetime.
[01:10:56.912 --> 01:11:00.233]  Now let's go over some more of these articles and I'll go to your phone calls.
[01:11:00.233 --> 01:11:04.554]  The FDA no longer needs to require animal tests before human drug trials.
[01:11:04.554 --> 01:11:06.915]  What did Fauci say four years ago?
[01:11:08.899 --> 01:11:09.119]  I don't
[01:11:28.934 --> 01:11:35.260]  Netanyahu a month ago with Jordan Peterson saying, we played the clip many times, he said, Israel are lab rats.
[01:11:35.260 --> 01:11:37.121]  Israel is a giant laboratory.
[01:11:37.121 --> 01:11:44.728]  I've turned the Israeli people over to Pfizer and others to now conduct all sorts of new mRNA so we find out what it does.
[01:11:44.728 --> 01:11:47.390]  We'll find out if it hurts you or if it helps you.
[01:11:47.390 --> 01:11:49.312]  What did the FDA board members say?
[01:11:49.312 --> 01:11:51.434]  We've got to just go ahead and authorize this for kids.
[01:11:51.434 --> 01:11:52.655]  We don't know what it'll do.
[01:11:52.655 --> 01:11:56.318]  We'll just authorize it like we did this other vaccine that killed a bunch of people.
[01:11:57.765 --> 01:12:02.408]  See, there's a moment where they got to just normalize all this and like, yeah, 5G gives you cancer.
[01:12:02.408 --> 01:12:07.552]  Yeah, it causes basically asthma-like events in their own studies, in rat studies and human studies.
[01:12:07.552 --> 01:12:09.393]  Yeah.
[01:12:09.393 --> 01:12:13.796]  But, oh, because it's too obvious with the rats, we just don't even do the studies anymore.
[01:12:13.796 --> 01:12:17.299]  We go directly to you and then cover up the results.
[01:12:17.299 --> 01:12:18.780]  Total weaponization.
[01:12:18.780 --> 01:12:20.962]  This is what an attack looks like.
[01:12:20.962 --> 01:12:25.525]  So I told you this is what was coming, and it was slipped into the bill, was passed in the last Congress in December.
[01:12:26.846 --> 01:12:28.287]  Science.org.
[01:12:28.287 --> 01:12:32.529]  FDA no longer needs to require animal tests before human drug trials.
[01:12:32.529 --> 01:12:39.412]  And the new drug trials they say will be done by emergency edict and will go directly to the public.
[01:12:39.412 --> 01:12:45.515]  But because there are never any real trials, no one can ever prove what's happening even though the death rates explode.
[01:12:45.515 --> 01:12:49.797]  Think of the super ultra diabolical nature of that.
[01:12:52.523 --> 01:12:54.665]  Another big report on InfoWars.com.
[01:12:54.665 --> 01:13:00.090]  COVID depopulation kill plan admitted by CDC as VAERS data released.
[01:13:00.090 --> 01:13:03.833]  Former chief scientist at Pfizer says it's a deliberate plan.
[01:13:03.833 --> 01:13:06.976]  Another big article from the Brownstone Institute on InfoWars.com.
[01:13:06.976 --> 01:13:10.239]  How can we trust institutions that lied?
[01:13:10.239 --> 01:13:17.746]  And it's a big thick article and it goes over how they premeditatedly lied, knew they were lying, and suppressed people telling the truth to carry out their deadly lie.
[01:13:19.381 --> 01:13:22.063]  Absolutely over the top.
[01:13:22.063 --> 01:13:30.149]  The good news, as MTG said last hour here live with us, she's calling for an immediate investigation, including a criminal investigation and a surge of sudden deaths.
[01:13:30.149 --> 01:13:45.460]  She told me a lot of inside baseball that I can't reveal to you yet, but it is going to be criminal investigations, not just by Congress looking at the criminality and calling for charges and referring charges to the Justice Department, but it's going to be even more that's about to be announced by other states, not just Florida.
[01:13:45.460 --> 01:13:46.421]  The dam is breaking.
[01:13:46.861 --> 01:13:51.463]  Here's what I mentioned earlier, so you can actually go watch the powerful interview and analysis.
[01:13:51.463 --> 01:13:56.785]  Covid shots are a toxic depopulation weapon being calibrated for mass culling.
[01:13:56.785 --> 01:13:58.205]  That's on Bandot Video.
[01:13:58.205 --> 01:14:00.746]  Our lives depend on you getting it and sharing it.
[01:14:00.746 --> 01:14:03.447]  But a lot of sites block the URL Bandot Video.
[01:14:03.447 --> 01:14:06.228]  That's why you use TheInfoWar.tv.
[01:14:06.228 --> 01:14:08.589]  TheInfoWar.tv.
[01:14:08.589 --> 01:14:09.410]  TheInfoWar.tv.
[01:14:14.133 --> 01:14:25.087]  Not censoring that URL yet, but we're about to launch an even more powerful URL that is, again, the whole site of Bandot Video, creating new links so you can send them out.
[01:14:25.087 --> 01:14:28.351]  You go to the same sites, the same sites, the same videos, just a different URL.
[01:14:29.369 --> 01:14:30.710]  So very, very important.
[01:14:30.710 --> 01:14:31.730]  Nothing to see here.
[01:14:31.730 --> 01:14:37.292]  Air Force Cadet 21 among several young people who died suddenly in past few days of heart attacks.
[01:14:37.292 --> 01:14:38.033]  But that's okay.
[01:14:38.033 --> 01:14:40.614]  Let's play this clip from Greta Thunberg.
[01:14:40.614 --> 01:14:47.857]  Greta Thunberg advises us to listen to the science and experts during COVID, which were all lying to us following a script.
[01:14:47.857 --> 01:14:48.257]  Here it is.
[01:14:49.710 --> 01:14:51.531]  Hi, my name is Greta Thunberg.
[01:14:51.531 --> 01:14:56.435]  I'm a climate and environment activist speaking to you from my couch in Stockholm, Sweden.
[01:14:56.435 --> 01:15:07.404]  I want to send all my love and support to everyone who is struggling in these difficult times and to everyone who is working on the front lines to keep the rest of us safe.
[01:15:07.404 --> 01:15:12.908]  We are right now in a crisis and we cannot solve any crisis without treating it as a crisis.
[01:15:14.059 --> 01:15:22.808]  We now must put our differences aside and cooperate and listen to the science and the experts as in every emergency.
[01:15:22.808 --> 01:15:28.033]  Humanity has to stand together in solidarity and leave no one behind.
[01:15:28.033 --> 01:15:35.540]  And then when this is finally over, we must start building real sustainable societies within the planetary boundaries.
[01:15:35.540 --> 01:15:36.541]  Thank you so much.
[01:15:36.541 --> 01:15:37.823]  I wish you a great evening.
[01:15:38.823 --> 01:15:46.912]  Translated, my parents are Antifa, I'm a globalist front person, there are too many of you, take the deadly shot, but believe me, I'm not taking them suckers.
[01:15:46.912 --> 01:15:50.916]  Meanwhile, powerful video, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Pfizer knew they were going to kill a lot of people.
[01:15:50.916 --> 01:15:55.261]  I'm going to play that video when we come back, and then go right to your phone calls.
[01:15:55.261 --> 01:15:58.124]  Sage, Steve, Todd, Dave, Lori, Ian.
[01:16:00.014 --> 01:16:03.935]  Ladies and gentlemen, a very exciting development has just taken place.
[01:16:03.935 --> 01:16:12.797]  I want to encourage you all to go to InfoWarsTore.com and check it out for yourself because it is a very strong, high quality formula.
[01:16:12.797 --> 01:16:17.878]  Gallon out sleep support, liquid, it's very fast acting, take it under the tongue.
[01:16:17.878 --> 01:16:26.139]  It's got a very good dose of melatonin, passion flower, valerian root extract, lemon balm, and German chamomile.
[01:16:26.139 --> 01:16:28.320]  All of these compounds are documented on record
[01:16:28.700 --> 01:16:29.060]  I think so.
[01:16:59.326 --> 01:17:02.669]  There's a war against our masculinity.
[01:17:02.669 --> 01:17:12.957]  There's a war in the environment, the food, the water, the air, the electromagnetics, the injections, to really cut us off from what God designed us to be.
[01:17:12.957 --> 01:17:16.720]  But, through Mother Nature, the Creator gave us compounds.
[01:17:17.540 --> 01:17:17.960]  We're good to go.
[01:17:33.996 --> 01:17:45.603]  This is private labeled three of the top best sellers in the country right now, but it's exclusively available under the brand name and private label of InfoWars Platinum at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:17:45.603 --> 01:17:52.708]  It's HGH Boost Max, it's Pain MD, and it's 1776 Testosterone Boost.
[01:17:52.708 --> 01:17:57.851]  You owe it to yourself and your way of life and your well-being to try these out and fund the InfoWar.
[01:17:59.468 --> 01:18:08.634]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are now launching the most powerful supplements in the history of InfoWars under a new brand name, InfoWars Platinum.
[01:18:08.634 --> 01:18:18.321]  Now, all three of these revolutionary products you see in front of you are already number one bestsellers in the market for the last few years because they work so well.
[01:18:18.321 --> 01:18:29.348]  We've gone right to the manufacturer who are listeners, the owner's a fan, and they've given us this huge deal off of retail, 40% off what these products are found for under other names.
[01:18:30.148 --> 01:18:30.688]  Thanks for watching!
[01:18:59.238 --> 01:19:08.664]  Introducing InfoWars super high-end supplement line at up to 50% off what these same formulas are sold for in stores.
[01:19:08.664 --> 01:19:12.946]  It's InfoWars MD, exclusively available at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:19:12.946 --> 01:19:21.551]  We have a new line of super quality CBD oils that are incredibly good for your entire body at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:19:21.551 --> 01:19:28.535]  We have Libido RX, Better Mood, Nitric Boost, Mushroom Maxx Powerful Nootropic, Ageless Vitality Collagen,
[01:19:28.855 --> 01:19:31.697]  Superfood greens and more.

[01:19:37.299 --> 01:19:42.962]  These formulas and more under the InfoWars MD banner are at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:19:42.962 --> 01:19:52.107]  They are private labeled clones of the top brands in the country for up to 50% off where you're going to find them in stores and other online stores.
[01:19:52.107 --> 01:19:54.968]  This is our new InfoWars MD Incredible line.
[01:20:01.303 --> 01:20:07.208]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones!
[01:20:20.083 --> 01:20:21.744]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:20:21.744 --> 01:20:25.466]  I'm Alex Jones, your host, and we're saving a lot of lives right now.
[01:20:25.466 --> 01:20:26.466]  They tried to censor us.
[01:20:26.466 --> 01:20:27.247]  They surveilled us.
[01:20:27.247 --> 01:20:28.687]  They attacked us.
[01:20:28.687 --> 01:20:30.828]  They came after so many great people.
[01:20:30.828 --> 01:20:39.313]  They censored you, but the truth's coming out about the poison shots, and that means their whole agenda will fail, of the World ID, of biomedical tyranny, forced injections.
[01:20:39.313 --> 01:20:42.995]  Your phone calls are coming up in a moment, but here's Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a true hero.
[01:20:42.995 --> 01:20:45.396]  Pfizer knew they were going to kill a lot of people.
[01:20:45.396 --> 01:20:46.937]  The documents now show.
[01:20:46.937 --> 01:20:47.357]  Here it is.
[01:20:49.161 --> 01:20:51.662]  We've never seen these kind of adverse reactions.
[01:20:51.662 --> 01:20:58.725]  They were predictable because if you look at the clinical trial data, even though they lied on the clinical trial data, Pfizer lied.
[01:20:58.725 --> 01:20:59.365]  We know that.
[01:20:59.365 --> 01:21:02.346]  There's no doubt about it.
[01:21:02.346 --> 01:21:05.007]  You know, Maddie DeGaray is a good example.
[01:21:05.007 --> 01:21:10.289]  She was one of 1,100 children in the 11 to 15-year-old trial.
[01:21:10.289 --> 01:21:15.831]  So they're going to give this to 76 million children based on these tiny trials.
[01:21:17.491 --> 01:21:24.778]  And so, any signal that you see in those trials, you have to assume is going to reverberate.
[01:21:24.778 --> 01:21:28.641]  You can extrapolate to the much larger group.
[01:21:28.641 --> 01:21:41.193]  Maddie DeGarry got a fever immediately after her vaccine, and she later gets seizures, and now she's in a wheelchair, apparently for life, and she's on a feeding tube.
[01:21:42.370 --> 01:21:50.654]  That's a fate worse than death, and it's to a cohort that has zero risk from dying of COVID.
[01:21:50.654 --> 01:21:58.798]  And if they give this to 76 million kids, they can expect that an injury like that will occur in one in every 1,100 kids.
[01:21:58.798 --> 01:22:03.060]  It's not guaranteed, but that's what Pfizer, when you do the clinical trial,
[01:22:04.232 --> 01:22:05.453]  That is how it works.
[01:22:05.453 --> 01:22:09.315]  You extrapolate any injury to the population as a whole.
[01:22:09.315 --> 01:22:15.039]  So that's 70,000 kids or something like that who could be injured in that terrible way.
[01:22:15.039 --> 01:22:22.504]  Kids who are at zero risk from COVID plus a heart attack we're seeing, the strokes we're seeing.
[01:22:22.504 --> 01:22:27.127]  The death rates from this vaccine are, there's been more deaths in eight months.
[01:22:28.533 --> 01:22:41.801]  And in all the billions of vaccines combined over the last 30 years, from this one vaccine, 17,000 reported deaths in the United States, and we know the death rate is much, much higher than that.
[01:22:41.801 --> 01:22:47.104]  Probably 40 times the best math, the best studies are showing that it's 40 times that.
[01:22:49.711 --> 01:22:56.095]  Oh, you know, the risks from the vaccine are completely untenable.
[01:22:56.095 --> 01:22:59.918]  If people knew the truth, they would not be taking this vaccine.
[01:22:59.918 --> 01:23:06.522]  And then the benefits of the vaccine are apparently zero or even sub-zero after six months.
[01:23:06.522 --> 01:23:14.067]  The British data is showing that the people who are vaccinated are actually more likely in many age categories to
[01:23:15.967 --> 01:23:23.512]  To get COVID and people who are unvaccinated, which by the way was predicted.
[01:23:23.512 --> 01:23:34.878]  Now, we know that Pfizer knew this was going to happen because in their clinical trial there were among in a six-month clinical trial was only six months.
[01:23:34.878 --> 01:23:43.423]  At the end of that period, 20 people died in the vaccine group and only 14 in the placebo group of all-cause mortality.
[01:23:44.676 --> 01:23:49.418]  There were five heart attacks in the vaccine group and only one in the placebo group.
[01:23:49.418 --> 01:23:58.622]  So your chance of dying of a heart attack from that vaccine, according to their own studies, is 500% greater than if you're unvaccinated.
[01:23:58.622 --> 01:24:02.484]  So they knew we were going to kill a lot of people.
[01:24:02.484 --> 01:24:04.065]  And they did it anyway.
[01:24:04.065 --> 01:24:14.209]  And people need to be able to see those studies and understand the deception, the criminal deception that has been imposed upon them.
[01:24:15.211 --> 01:24:18.132]  A criminal deception that has been imposed upon us.
[01:24:18.132 --> 01:24:24.555]  And we have the former head scientist at Pfizer saying the exact same thing because it's a fact.
[01:24:24.555 --> 01:24:26.055]  That's why this broadcast is so important.
[01:24:26.055 --> 01:24:28.476]  That's why you sharing the articles, the video is so important.
[01:24:28.476 --> 01:24:32.518]  Because people are really starting to wake up and we're close to defeating these people.
[01:24:32.518 --> 01:24:34.319]  I'm going to go to your calls in a moment.
[01:24:34.319 --> 01:24:37.520]  But as I told you, we're funded by viewers like you.
[01:24:37.520 --> 01:24:41.902]  We had thousands and thousands of people buy signed copies of The Great Reset and The War for the World.
[01:24:43.354 --> 01:24:46.255]  And it really helped us stay on air.
[01:24:46.255 --> 01:24:48.796]  And I've said we're going to have this come to an end now.
[01:24:48.796 --> 01:24:55.798]  There are 1,400 books left that we have that are to be signed.
[01:24:55.798 --> 01:24:57.499]  And I signed 500 of them this week.
[01:24:57.499 --> 01:24:59.319]  I'm going to sign another 500 this weekend.
[01:24:59.319 --> 01:25:01.820]  Another 300, 400 on Monday.
[01:25:01.820 --> 01:25:02.901]  They'll go into the warehouse.
[01:25:02.901 --> 01:25:06.042]  They've already got 300 signed in the warehouse.
[01:25:06.042 --> 01:25:07.422]  Those 1,400, 1,500 books, I forget the exact number, are gone.
[01:25:10.618 --> 01:25:14.841]  I'm never going to sign another one of these books again.
[01:25:14.841 --> 01:25:19.584]  We are going to put one out that has a piece of art I'm going to do, but I haven't done it yet in the future.
[01:25:19.584 --> 01:25:24.307]  That'll be a limited run at patriotcollectibles.com or 7076coin.com.
[01:25:24.307 --> 01:25:31.712]  But for just a simple signed book to know that you were part of the fundraiser, you helped keep us on air, and a memento of history.
[01:25:32.532 --> 01:25:36.253]  We're going to sign less than 1,500 more of these and that's it.
[01:25:36.253 --> 01:25:38.954]  And that will really help us stay on air.
[01:25:38.954 --> 01:25:44.697]  If you'll just take action and go buy a signed book and an unsigned to give to the library or whatever you'd like.
[01:25:44.697 --> 01:25:46.557]  The unsigned are $20-something.
[01:25:46.557 --> 01:25:51.919]  Hardcover, The Death Star Plans, The New World Order, The Great Reset and The War for the World and Infowarshore.com.
[01:25:51.919 --> 01:25:52.460]  The signed are $99.
[01:25:54.482 --> 01:25:59.489]  That's just like NPR where they sell a ball cap for $50 or a t-shirt for $100 or a coffee mug for $50.
[01:25:59.489 --> 01:26:02.733]  Everybody knows the coffee cup didn't cost $50 for $20.
[01:26:02.733 --> 01:26:04.616]  It means you were part of the pledge drive.
[01:26:04.616 --> 01:26:07.019]  We don't get billions like NPR and PBS.
[01:26:07.019 --> 01:26:08.702]  We get nothing from taxpayers.
[01:26:09.861 --> 01:26:15.442]  But via your free will, you can go get this historic book that went to number one in the world off and on for the first month of its sale.
[01:26:15.442 --> 01:26:19.403]  It's still in the top 100, still in the top 10 books on political science.
[01:26:19.403 --> 01:26:22.624]  The Great Reset and the War for the World is the true rulers of the planet.
[01:26:22.624 --> 01:26:24.364]  Have the signed book.
[01:26:24.364 --> 01:26:25.784]  Know that you supported the broadcast.
[01:26:25.784 --> 01:26:27.044]  I thank you for your support.
[01:26:27.044 --> 01:26:31.545]  Please go to mfulworestore.com right now and get The Great Reset and the War for the World.
[01:26:31.545 --> 01:26:35.746]  And I am going to sign the last 800 or so that I haven't signed yet.
[01:26:35.746 --> 01:26:38.487]  And then that, ladies and gentlemen, is it.
[01:26:38.487 --> 01:26:39.267]  And I'm going to sign 20.
[01:26:41.069 --> 01:26:41.349]  We're good.
[01:27:01.826 --> 01:27:02.827]  Support the broadcast.
[01:27:02.827 --> 01:27:06.150]  You can also get great supplements to support your immune system and your body.
[01:27:06.150 --> 01:27:08.352]  The Real Red Pill Plus is going to sell out soon.
[01:27:08.352 --> 01:27:09.793]  Despite that, it's 50% off.
[01:27:09.793 --> 01:27:11.075]  Don't have time to tell you about it?
[01:27:11.075 --> 01:27:15.859]  Go research the Real Red Pill Plus at infowarshore.com and down and out.
[01:27:15.859 --> 01:27:18.321]  Our strongest sleep aid is also back in stock.
[01:27:18.321 --> 01:27:19.402]  40% off.
[01:27:19.402 --> 01:27:19.543]  Okay.
[01:27:21.519 --> 01:27:22.440]  Let's do this.
[01:27:22.440 --> 01:27:24.281]  Let me hit a few more of the vaccine news stories.
[01:27:24.281 --> 01:27:24.901]  I'll go to a break.
[01:27:24.901 --> 01:27:26.562]  Come right back with your phone calls.
[01:27:26.562 --> 01:27:31.745]  Moderna CEO announces new mRNA shot to treat heart failure in patients.
[01:27:31.745 --> 01:27:37.269]  Wow, there's suddenly all this massive heart failure in all these people and they've got a drug that counters the blood clots.
[01:27:37.269 --> 01:27:41.872]  Man, that's really... Now you know why they wanted one four times stronger than Pfizer.
[01:27:41.872 --> 01:27:43.793]  It's the exact same shot, just four times stronger.
[01:27:45.495 --> 01:27:48.536]  If you're wanting to have a heart attack, folks, take the Moderna.
[01:27:48.536 --> 01:27:56.339]  White House confirms Biden aides located Obama-era classified documents at two locations in his home.
[01:27:56.339 --> 01:27:56.740]  Boom.
[01:27:56.740 --> 01:27:57.280]  Caught red-handed.
[01:27:57.280 --> 01:27:59.621]  He said he didn't know who left the documents at the college.
[01:27:59.621 --> 01:28:02.082]  Now they found them pretending to Communist China.
[01:28:02.082 --> 01:28:02.482]  Treason.
[01:28:04.042 --> 01:28:09.186]  But as MTG said earlier, this is them getting ready to carry out the garbage and get Gavin Newsom ready.
[01:28:09.186 --> 01:28:14.289]  So as much as I hate Biden, they're only bringing this out now because he's already stolen the election.
[01:28:14.289 --> 01:28:18.112]  Tucker Carlson, Biden classified docs and UPenn's China ties.
[01:28:19.093 --> 01:28:21.216]  And it goes on and on from there.
[01:28:21.216 --> 01:28:24.960]  That is such an incredibly important issue.
[01:28:24.960 --> 01:28:30.467]  Red-handed reveals China's donations to the University of Pennsylvania soared at the Biden Center announcement.
[01:28:30.467 --> 01:28:34.433]  The building he was in was paid for by the Chinese government.
[01:28:34.433 --> 01:28:36.715]  But Joy Behar, prostitute,
[01:28:37.711 --> 01:28:42.376]  Shill says Biden should be given benefit of the doubt for taking classified docs.
[01:28:42.376 --> 01:28:44.758]  When he did it, it's illegal because the vice president can't do it.
[01:28:44.758 --> 01:28:46.700]  He did it before he was president.
[01:28:46.700 --> 01:28:48.943]  Infowars.com, tomorrow's news.
[01:28:48.943 --> 01:28:54.368]  Today, your phone calls are straight ahead on the other side.
[01:28:54.368 --> 01:28:54.969]  Stay with us.
[01:28:58.848 --> 01:29:06.373]  Like a rock thrown into a pond, your actions, even though they may seem little, have a massive ripple effect throughout time and space.
[01:29:06.373 --> 01:29:08.015]  We're actually winning the Info Award.
[01:29:08.015 --> 01:29:18.182]  And when you realize that Bandot Video has hundreds and hundreds of censored directors and investigative journalists and talk show hosts, whose information is beyond incredible.
[01:29:18.182 --> 01:29:23.906]  Hundreds of medical doctors and scientists, all of them, right now, telling the truth at Bandot Video.
[01:29:23.906 --> 01:29:26.108]  Millions of people a day, visiting Bandot Video.
[01:29:26.448 --> 01:29:36.035]  But you can take that information and cause a bigger ripple effect, an amplifying effect, and make sure it gets out to your friends, your family, your neighbors, and perfect strangers.
[01:29:36.035 --> 01:29:38.597]  You are the modern Paul Reveres.
[01:29:38.597 --> 01:29:41.739]  You are what takes our information and amplifies it.
[01:29:41.739 --> 01:29:47.003]  When you decide to take action, we as a species and as a race are invincible.
[01:29:47.003 --> 01:29:54.409]  So I thank you all for your past action, and I challenge you to redouble your efforts now, because humanity and the children are counting on you.
[01:29:59.614 --> 01:30:01.436]  Infowars is winning.
[01:30:01.436 --> 01:30:03.477]  Infowars is reaching more people than ever.
[01:30:03.477 --> 01:30:06.260]  We were supposed to be off the air months and months and months ago.
[01:30:06.260 --> 01:30:09.022]  Mainstream media told you, but it's not true.
[01:30:09.022 --> 01:30:11.124]  They told you we were going to be shut down.
[01:30:11.124 --> 01:30:13.185]  They told you we owed a billion and a half dollars.
[01:30:13.185 --> 01:30:14.146]  None of that's true.
[01:30:14.146 --> 01:30:15.047]  It's all being appealed.
[01:30:15.527 --> 01:30:24.490]  They want you to think InfoWars is dead, but if you simply stand up and support InfoWars, we've got years and years of appeals, and we will not be taken off the air.
[01:30:24.490 --> 01:30:27.931]  But if they can convince you that we've been shut down, they're going to win.
[01:30:27.931 --> 01:30:30.632]  Don't let the globalists psyop you and your family.
[01:30:30.632 --> 01:30:40.516]  Go to InfoWarsTore.com and get incredible products, supplements, books, films, t-shirts, you name it, that fund the InfoWars and empower your life, and let the globalists know their psyop has not worked.
[01:30:40.996 --> 01:30:42.337]  Thanks for keeping us on the air.
[01:30:42.337 --> 01:30:50.783]  Take action at InfoWarsTore.com today, because the only people who can take us off the air is you, the viewers and listeners.
[01:30:50.783 --> 01:30:54.225]  The majority of you have not been silenced, but some of you have.
[01:30:54.225 --> 01:30:56.007]  Do not let the gloveless brainwash you.
[01:30:56.007 --> 01:30:57.928]  Go to InfoWarsTore.com to keep us on the air.
[01:30:59.471 --> 01:31:05.877]  I have an extremely important message to all of my fellow InfoWarriors here in the United States and around the world.
[01:31:05.877 --> 01:31:10.521]  We are so excited to announce InfoWars MD.
[01:31:10.521 --> 01:31:13.103]  It turns out the top company in the U.S.
[01:31:13.103 --> 01:31:15.545]  for supplements is owned by a Patreon.
[01:31:15.545 --> 01:31:22.312]  And it turns out they're willing to give us deals that no one else is getting because they want to support InfoWars and keep us on the air.
[01:31:22.312 --> 01:31:25.675]  This deal has been a year in the making and finally the products are being brought to market.
[01:31:26.295 --> 01:31:36.985]  Up to 50% off what you get on top national brands that are the highest rated under the InfoWars label, InfoWars MD, exclusively at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:31:36.985 --> 01:31:42.230]  Check out the first of 10 new products at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:31:42.230 --> 01:31:47.635]  Whether it's turmeric, or whether it's joint care, or whether it is super greens, we have them all.
[01:31:48.035 --> 01:31:52.558]  So when I first started taking survival skills, basically I was 275 pounds.
[01:31:52.558 --> 01:31:54.620]  I was overweight.
[01:31:54.620 --> 01:31:56.682]  I had brain fog like you wouldn't believe.
[01:32:06.929 --> 01:32:07.630]  I don't think so.
[01:32:22.921 --> 01:32:28.265]  Two weeks, I went from brain fog to like literally like my brain was enlightened.
[01:32:28.265 --> 01:32:29.706]  You know, I could think again.
[01:32:29.706 --> 01:32:31.547]  I could connect with people again.
[01:32:31.547 --> 01:32:37.912]  And over the course of the next couple of years, I got my health back and I religiously take basically all of your supplements.
[01:32:37.912 --> 01:32:40.313]  They're all absolutely amazing supplements.
[01:32:40.313 --> 01:32:42.195]  The one I like recently is Knockout.
[01:32:42.195 --> 01:32:44.436]  It literally, like if you want to sleep, just take it.
[01:32:44.436 --> 01:32:45.177]  It's amazing.
[01:32:45.177 --> 01:32:45.517]  It works.
[01:32:45.657 --> 01:32:48.259]  But anyway, so the point is, we have to get ourselves clean.
[01:32:48.259 --> 01:32:54.403]  We have to break free of the globalist system, and the only way to do that is to take our own health into our own hands.
[01:32:54.403 --> 01:32:55.483]  Beautifully said, brother.
[01:32:55.483 --> 01:33:01.407]  I thank you so much for your call, and Godspeed.
[01:33:01.407 --> 01:33:07.291]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:10.615 --> 01:33:17.701]  But where are the clowns?
[01:33:17.701 --> 01:33:20.643]  Send in the clowns.
[01:33:20.643 --> 01:33:23.906]  There should be clowns.
[01:33:23.906 --> 01:33:25.948]  Don't bother.
[01:33:25.948 --> 01:33:27.909]  They're here.
[01:33:27.909 --> 01:33:30.372]  They're here.
[01:33:30.372 --> 01:33:35.556]  They want us to live in their clown world and suspend common sense and be their slaves, but we're not gonna do it.
[01:33:36.408 --> 01:33:38.070]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:38.070 --> 01:33:44.318]  Look, I'm not going to get into this story a little bit next hour because it's about me, but it's just about the system and all their lies.
[01:33:44.318 --> 01:33:51.947]  You remember they falsely said in that rig court where the judge already said I was guilty five months ago in Texas and the whole Sandy Hook garbage.
[01:33:52.648 --> 01:33:59.475]  That they had my whole phone for two years, and it had January 6th stuff on it, and they were referring it to law enforcement, and I was caught.
[01:33:59.475 --> 01:34:00.256]  All this crap.
[01:34:00.256 --> 01:34:03.540]  I gave all my cell phones to my lawyers, did all the discovery.
[01:34:03.540 --> 01:34:08.725]  The judge said I gave no discovery, and my lawyers even sent a raw text of six months off my phone.
[01:34:09.508 --> 01:34:12.429]  They dug through it all, of course found nothing.
[01:34:12.429 --> 01:34:15.670]  I think the media will probably make something up at some point.
[01:34:15.670 --> 01:34:16.931]  They're so angry.
[01:34:16.931 --> 01:34:22.452]  But they had Tucker Carlson text messages between he and I. And I'm not going to get into Tucker Carlson.
[01:34:22.452 --> 01:34:24.333]  We've been friends for more than 10 years.
[01:34:24.333 --> 01:34:26.474]  And we get dinner and stuff and we hang out.
[01:34:26.474 --> 01:34:28.314]  And they were asking me all this stuff.
[01:34:28.314 --> 01:34:32.676]  I didn't answer their questions when the Huffington Post and a bunch of others called.
[01:34:32.676 --> 01:34:34.696]  I called one of the reporters up and made jokes at him.
[01:34:34.696 --> 01:34:36.717]  I said, oh, you caught me in the closet.
[01:34:36.717 --> 01:34:38.538]  You're like the hall monitor in sixth grade.
[01:34:39.338 --> 01:34:41.800]  You're on to me.
[01:34:41.800 --> 01:34:44.782]  I mean, everybody knows Tucker Carlson's been on the show some.
[01:34:44.782 --> 01:34:47.344]  Everybody knows that.
[01:34:47.344 --> 01:34:51.447]  And everybody knows he said that I was right about almost everything on air.
[01:34:51.447 --> 01:34:54.469]  But they act like they catch us in something.
[01:34:54.469 --> 01:34:57.472]  And I thought the Huffington Post would be the first to break it.
[01:34:57.472 --> 01:34:58.392]  They've been the ones calling me.
[01:34:58.392 --> 01:35:03.996]  But Rolling Stone has all my text messages from six months in the year 2019 and early
[01:35:06.723 --> 01:35:06.743]  2020.
[01:35:06.743 --> 01:35:08.204]  Talk about stalking.
[01:35:08.204 --> 01:35:12.706]  And the reporter I talked to yesterday kept saying, I want Tucker to know that I'm reading his texts.
[01:35:12.706 --> 01:35:16.008]  I want you to tell him that I'm going to do an article on him.
[01:35:16.008 --> 01:35:17.709]  And he goes, have you talked to Tucker?
[01:35:17.709 --> 01:35:19.029]  Have you talked to Tucker?
[01:35:19.029 --> 01:35:21.750]  And I said, I'm not going to answer your question, but I'll tell the listeners.
[01:35:21.750 --> 01:35:22.651]  Yeah, I did.
[01:35:22.651 --> 01:35:24.592]  And Tucker said they can fuck off.
[01:35:27.731 --> 01:35:32.993]  There's this quote for your story, but I respect my audience, so I'll tell my audience what Tucker said.
[01:35:32.993 --> 01:35:34.773]  F off, I don't care.
[01:35:34.773 --> 01:35:36.114]  I'm proud to be your friend.
[01:35:36.114 --> 01:35:39.295]  There, there's your quote from Tucker when I talked to him yesterday morning.
[01:35:39.295 --> 01:35:41.556]  So, it's just insane.
[01:35:42.694 --> 01:35:48.995]  How they try to bully and intimidate and oh Alex Jones knows Tucker and Tucker's bad.
[01:35:48.995 --> 01:36:01.137]  Tucker Carlson's defended me more than 50 times on air and I appreciate him because he knows I'm telling the truth and I'm a good person and so is he and I love Tucker Carlson and I'm so glad that he dominates the news cycle.
[01:36:01.137 --> 01:36:03.578]  Said I'll get to it later but look at this article.
[01:36:03.578 --> 01:36:11.699]  They then admit oh it's six months of text messages the end of 2019 early 2020 and they say it's innocuous and there's nothing there.
[01:36:13.757 --> 01:36:18.778]  But it just shows how influential Jones is and how radical Tucker Carlson is.
[01:36:18.778 --> 01:36:26.240]  And then they sit there like schoolgirls and talk about our private messages and pour over them.
[01:36:26.240 --> 01:36:29.221]  And they don't even know how to interpret them right.
[01:36:29.221 --> 01:36:30.422]  It's early 2000.
[01:36:30.422 --> 01:36:32.402]  I'm saying it's a bio attack.
[01:36:32.402 --> 01:36:33.763]  Trump at first thought it was nothing.
[01:36:33.763 --> 01:36:34.863]  I said they're going to set him up.
[01:36:34.863 --> 01:36:39.264]  If he doesn't at least respond, he'll be sucker punched.
[01:36:39.264 --> 01:36:40.404]  That's in there too.
[01:36:40.404 --> 01:36:42.245]  So this is the level
[01:36:43.616 --> 01:36:46.418]  Of garbage that these people engage in.
[01:36:46.418 --> 01:36:47.559]  And that's exactly what it is.
[01:36:47.559 --> 01:36:50.301]  It's total and complete garbage.
[01:36:50.301 --> 01:36:52.542]  And it's ridiculous.
[01:36:52.542 --> 01:36:57.445]  And boy, if they knew who else I was talking to.
[01:36:57.445 --> 01:36:59.587]  Members of Congress.
[01:36:59.587 --> 01:37:01.908]  Foreign leaders.
[01:37:01.908 --> 01:37:03.709]  Big, other big Fox hosts.
[01:37:03.709 --> 01:37:05.090]  I mean, I go out and have dinner with them.
[01:37:05.090 --> 01:37:05.891]  They all know I'm right.
[01:37:06.772 --> 01:37:07.772]  They can't go all the way.
[01:37:07.772 --> 01:37:11.634]  Only Tucker is able for some reason to be able to get everything out.
[01:37:11.634 --> 01:37:12.514]  And he is the freest.
[01:37:12.514 --> 01:37:17.056]  And I'm not going to give you the inside baseball in it, but let's just say this.
[01:37:17.056 --> 01:37:20.937]  Tucker did not get paid what he could get paid to have total freedom.
[01:37:20.937 --> 01:37:23.818]  And so he's done a lot to be able to tell the truth.
[01:37:23.818 --> 01:37:25.018]  And I think Tucker's an icon.
[01:37:25.018 --> 01:37:25.438]  I love him.
[01:37:25.438 --> 01:37:27.359]  And it's great.
[01:37:27.359 --> 01:37:29.140]  And I know how Tucker operates.
[01:37:29.140 --> 01:37:31.080]  Dummies.
[01:37:31.080 --> 01:37:35.102]  Your attempts to drive a wedge between Tucker and I and our families
[01:37:36.494 --> 01:37:40.095]  is going to do nothing but blow up in your faces.
[01:37:40.095 --> 01:37:43.277]  So, please, I shouldn't be so honest with the enemy.
[01:37:43.277 --> 01:37:44.997]  Let me do this instead, I'll be sarcastic.
[01:37:44.997 --> 01:37:47.098]  Please stop reporting on me and Parker Carlson!
[01:37:47.098 --> 01:37:49.459]  Please don't tell Tucker not to talk to me!
[01:37:49.459 --> 01:37:51.600]  Please don't tell Tucker not to defend me!
[01:37:51.600 --> 01:37:52.780]  Stop!
[01:37:52.780 --> 01:37:53.120]  Stop!
[01:37:53.120 --> 01:37:54.721]  Don't throw me in the briar patch!
[01:37:54.721 --> 01:37:58.022]  Do not leave me and Tucker alone!
[01:37:58.022 --> 01:37:58.802]  Stop it!
[01:37:58.802 --> 01:38:00.743]  You're gonna make him be mean to me!
[01:38:00.743 --> 01:38:00.843]  Oh no!
[01:38:06.167 --> 01:38:08.448]  It's just, don't they get it?
[01:38:08.448 --> 01:38:09.708]  We don't care what you say.
[01:38:09.708 --> 01:38:10.909]  We don't care what you do.
[01:38:10.909 --> 01:38:15.650]  And in fact, when you tell us not to do something, we do it more.
[01:38:15.650 --> 01:38:16.891]  I've already won.
[01:38:16.891 --> 01:38:22.032]  Let me give the left a little newsflash, and I'm not bragging, and I'll go to your calls.
[01:38:22.032 --> 01:38:24.513]  I'm giving you a status report on how positive things are.
[01:38:24.513 --> 01:38:26.494]  The viewers and listeners are anonymous.
[01:38:27.614 --> 01:38:37.102]  You get to work as a doctor, or a nurse, or a school teacher, or a police officer, or a farmer, or an auto mechanic, or an 18-wheeler driver, or an artist.
[01:38:37.102 --> 01:38:38.964]  You get to be anonymous.
[01:38:38.964 --> 01:38:41.746]  Your wife knows you, your husband knows you, your church knows you, your family.
[01:38:41.746 --> 01:38:43.147]  But when you go to the store, you're anonymous.
[01:38:43.147 --> 01:38:44.288]  I'm not anonymous.
[01:38:44.288 --> 01:38:46.090]  I'm known all over the world.
[01:38:46.090 --> 01:38:47.271]  And let me tell you what happens.
[01:38:48.459 --> 01:38:53.224]  For 15, 20 years, everywhere I go, I shake hands, and the positive responses were 95%.
[01:38:53.224 --> 01:39:00.911]  Let me tell you, but it would be only, if I was in a restaurant, maybe one group would come over, 15, 20 years ago.
[01:39:00.911 --> 01:39:03.834]  Now I go to a restaurant, I say, listen, can I be put in a private room?
[01:39:03.834 --> 01:39:06.276]  Not because I don't care about the public, it's going to make a major scene.
[01:39:06.276 --> 01:39:07.898]  If they don't have a private room, you know what happens?
[01:39:07.898 --> 01:39:09.740]  My food gets bought almost every time.
[01:39:11.087 --> 01:39:37.595]  And I get mobbed all around the table, and I'm signing autographs for the waiters, and the owner comes out, and I get followed into the parking lot, and women are throwing themselves at me, and I'm not bragging about it, I'm just telling you, when the establishment that's so hated came out and demonized me and lied about me and attacked me, all this crap we've been put through, it's been hard for my family, it's been hard for me, we do get haters, we do get stalkers, that 1% that attacks us is terrible, it's not all been roses, but
[01:39:39.071 --> 01:39:45.192]  They have made us way bigger and iconic out there, and it's blown up in their face!
[01:39:45.192 --> 01:39:55.635]  And now, I'll wear sunglasses and a ball cap if I'm on a hike, and I don't even talk, people recognize my voice, because I can't walk in the woods.
[01:39:55.635 --> 01:40:01.736]  I can be in the woods and nobody around me would say, my kid's fishing, and people will hear me 20 yards away and go, oh, it's Alex Jones!
[01:40:03.772 --> 01:40:09.015]  If you want to know how popular freedom is, if you want to know how popular the awakening is, I'm a litmus test.
[01:40:09.015 --> 01:40:13.178]  I'm like a sensor in an engine to tell you how hot the engine is or how much gas is left in the tank.
[01:40:13.178 --> 01:40:14.159]  I'm a sensor.
[01:40:14.159 --> 01:40:17.441]  So because I'm a public figure, I get to see the response.
[01:40:17.441 --> 01:40:22.464]  And I'll be honest, when Trump first got elected, I went from 21 positive comments
[01:40:23.024 --> 01:40:26.807]  To 15 to 5 positive versus negative.
[01:40:26.807 --> 01:40:29.428]  So for every 15 positive on the street, I get 5 negative.
[01:40:29.428 --> 01:40:30.169]  It was bad.
[01:40:30.169 --> 01:40:34.672]  If I walk down the street, cars will pull over, F you Russian spy, I'm gonna kill you, you're a horrible person.
[01:40:34.672 --> 01:40:36.253]  It was rough the first few years of Trump.
[01:40:37.233 --> 01:40:39.614]  Because I was getting some major hate.
[01:40:39.614 --> 01:40:42.956]  Now it's 99% love.
[01:40:42.956 --> 01:40:44.857]  I go to the grocery store, love.
[01:40:44.857 --> 01:40:48.279]  I go to a random church, the preacher comes at the end and shakes my hand.
[01:40:48.279 --> 01:40:50.159]  Been listening for years at a mega church.
[01:40:50.159 --> 01:40:50.860]  It's love.
[01:40:50.860 --> 01:40:52.401]  Go to a small church, it's love.
[01:40:52.401 --> 01:40:54.582]  Go to a wedding in a middle of nowhere, it's love.
[01:40:54.582 --> 01:40:56.683]  Go to a place to go fishing on the coast.
[01:40:56.683 --> 01:40:59.444]  The whole, oh, you know, we're not charging you to deep sea fishing $1,000.
[01:40:59.444 --> 01:41:03.246]  You know, Mr. Jones, the gas is free too.
[01:41:03.246 --> 01:41:04.507]  We're gonna take you fishing for free.
[01:41:05.387 --> 01:41:07.908]  By the way, when we catch all these fish, I'm going to take you to the best places.
[01:41:07.908 --> 01:41:13.969]  I only take my family to even catch more fish, and then we're going to take you to a restaurant and cook those fish, and all I want to do is drink a beer with you.
[01:41:13.969 --> 01:41:15.790]  That's what I get!
[01:41:15.790 --> 01:41:19.851]  Love, love, love, love, love, love, love!
[01:41:19.851 --> 01:41:22.011]  Because people know the government's hijacked.
[01:41:22.011 --> 01:41:24.452]  They know the Democratic Party are satanic pedophiles.
[01:41:24.452 --> 01:41:28.153]  They know you're a pack of lying trash and garbage.
[01:41:28.153 --> 01:41:31.594]  Black people, white people, Hispanics, Asians,
[01:41:31.914 --> 01:41:37.138]  Gay, straight, old, young, they love InfoWars!
[01:41:37.138 --> 01:41:41.501]  They love Alex Jones because they hate you!
[01:41:41.501 --> 01:41:44.883]  And they know you hate me, so they love me!
[01:41:44.883 --> 01:41:50.007]  I remember Politico, we really helped Rand Paul get elected the first time in the Senate.
[01:41:50.007 --> 01:41:52.989]  They called up pissed and they go, what could we have done to defeat him?
[01:41:52.989 --> 01:41:55.811]  Why did he win by such a landslide when we attacked him so much?
[01:41:55.811 --> 01:41:57.032]  And I said, all you gotta do is endorse him.
[01:41:59.423 --> 01:42:02.044]  All you gotta do is endorse him, he'd have been voted out.
[01:42:02.044 --> 01:42:03.504]  Notice that the left's gotten smart now.
[01:42:03.504 --> 01:42:09.886]  They claimed MTG's a fake right-winger and MTG's really a leftist because they've gotten smart.
[01:42:09.886 --> 01:42:11.267]  They're like, oh my god, what do we do?
[01:42:11.267 --> 01:42:12.687]  Well, we'll claim she's a sellout.
[01:42:12.687 --> 01:42:16.028]  Yeah, that fooled a little bit, but not much.
[01:42:16.028 --> 01:42:17.389]  They're out of bullets, folks.
[01:42:17.389 --> 01:42:18.309]  They're failing.
[01:42:18.309 --> 01:42:19.329]  They're falling apart.
[01:42:19.329 --> 01:42:20.450]  They're a joke.
[01:42:20.450 --> 01:42:26.732]  So Tucker Carlson's message to the media, trying to shame him for being Alex Jones' friend, is
[01:42:27.572 --> 01:42:29.092]  I'm proud to be your friend.
[01:42:29.092 --> 01:42:31.093]  Tell them to F off.
[01:42:31.093 --> 01:42:36.635]  Tell them to F U dash K off.
[01:42:36.635 --> 01:42:39.135]  That's what Tucker Carlson's message is.
[01:42:39.135 --> 01:42:40.036]  F off.
[01:42:40.036 --> 01:42:40.956]  F off.
[01:42:40.956 --> 01:42:41.496]  F off.
[01:42:41.496 --> 01:42:43.777]  In fact, he wanted that message to be relayed here.
[01:42:43.777 --> 01:42:44.197]  F off.
[01:42:44.197 --> 01:42:47.258]  If he can't do it on Fox News, I'll do it for him.
[01:42:47.258 --> 01:42:49.278]  Fuck off, mainstream media!
[01:42:49.278 --> 01:42:51.059]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:42:51.059 --> 01:42:52.599]  Infowars.com tomorrow.
[01:42:52.599 --> 01:42:54.620]  I promise I will go right to your calls.
[01:42:54.620 --> 01:42:55.080]  Stay with us.
[01:42:55.080 --> 01:42:55.960]  Big guests coming up as well.
[01:42:59.292 --> 01:43:02.240]  I want you to remember two words.
[01:43:02.240 --> 01:43:03.384]  InfoWars Platinum.
[01:43:04.659 --> 01:43:04.899]  Yeah.
[01:43:34.979 --> 01:43:36.079]  These are incredible.
[01:43:36.079 --> 01:43:42.521]  Pain MD, HGH Max Boost, and of course, 1776 Testosterone Boost.
[01:43:42.521 --> 01:43:50.544]  Read about them at InfoWarsTore.com, learn about them, and then try them out for yourself, and I know you will be a repeat customer, which is awesome.

[01:43:55.985 --> 01:43:58.926]  InfoWars Platinum, now available at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:43:59.466 --> 01:44:05.472]  Climb to the top of the food chain with Alpha Power by Infowars Life.
[01:44:05.472 --> 01:44:09.616]  For those who want to increase testosterone and energy levels.
[01:44:09.616 --> 01:44:15.201]  Most men know that testosterone levels begin to decline starting around 30 at a rate of about 1-2% per year.
[01:44:17.663 --> 01:44:24.810]  This drop can show signs such as fatigue, low energy, low sex drive, and muscle loss.

[01:44:30.675 --> 01:44:39.383]  The secret is in the synergistic blend of ancient ingredients that have been concentrated into their most potent forms, including
[01:44:40.123 --> 01:44:43.467]  Eurycoma longifolia, originally from Malaysia.
[01:44:43.467 --> 01:44:49.774]  Macaru from Peru, horny goatweed from China, and tribulus from India.
[01:44:49.774 --> 01:44:53.879]  Reach your alpha male potential with Alpha Power.

[01:44:59.005 --> 01:45:02.309]  Everybody that's watching this needs to support Alex Jones.
[01:45:02.309 --> 01:45:05.192]  Needs to support InfoWars and Band.Video.
[01:45:05.192 --> 01:45:07.895]  You know, the Bible says, let another mouth praise you.
[01:45:07.895 --> 01:45:09.196]  I'm gonna do that right now.
[01:45:09.196 --> 01:45:13.100]  Alex Jones has helped so many people in this industry.
[01:45:13.100 --> 01:45:17.986]  You guys have no idea how many people have got their first start like Savannah Hernandez.
[01:45:18.286 --> 01:45:24.449]  How many people have just been put on a launch pad to outer space because of Alex Jones, including myself?
[01:45:24.449 --> 01:45:33.072]  I've been given so many opportunities because of this man and because of this platform, and I would probably not even be half of where I am right now if it weren't for Alex Jones.
[01:45:33.072 --> 01:45:38.775]  I mean, I've been able to be on podcasts with Alex and Joe Rogan and TimCast, the super TimCast IRL.
[01:45:38.775 --> 01:45:44.197]  Listen, what I'm saying is, do not take Alex Jones and Bandot video for granted.
[01:45:44.437 --> 01:45:46.920]  Because you don't know what you have until it's gone.
[01:45:46.920 --> 01:45:49.603]  We need to support free speech systems right now.
[01:45:49.603 --> 01:45:51.105]  So go check out the store.
[01:45:51.105 --> 01:45:52.286]  Go support their store.
[01:45:52.286 --> 01:45:53.788]  Go support InfoWars.
[01:45:53.788 --> 01:45:55.149]  Leave a donation right now.
[01:45:55.149 --> 01:45:56.651]  Don't wait until they're gone!
[01:45:59.133 --> 01:46:05.538]  I have an extremely important message to all of my fellow InfoWarriors here in the United States and around the world.
[01:46:05.538 --> 01:46:10.182]  We are so excited to announce InfoWars MD.
[01:46:10.182 --> 01:46:12.964]  It turns out the top company in the U.S.

[01:46:15.206 --> 01:46:21.971]  And it turns out they're willing to give us deals that no one else is getting because they want to support InfoWars and keep us on the air.
[01:46:21.971 --> 01:46:25.354]  This deal has been a year in the making and finally the products are being brought to market.
[01:46:25.974 --> 01:46:36.645]  Up to 50% off what you get on top national brands that are the highest rated under the Info Wars label, Info Wars MD, exclusively at InfoWarsStore.com.

[01:47:00.698 --> 01:47:06.600]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:47:33.691 --> 01:47:36.133]  Ride the tiger!
[01:48:03.463 --> 01:48:10.068]  Between the Velvet Lies!
[01:48:10.068 --> 01:48:14.872]  Oh, she blows him hard!
[01:48:32.108 --> 01:48:34.170]  Between the velvet lies!
[01:48:34.170 --> 01:48:37.112]  There's a truth!
[01:48:37.112 --> 01:48:41.235]  The vision never dies!
[01:48:41.235 --> 01:48:51.323]  Alright, let's go to your phone calls.
[01:48:51.323 --> 01:48:52.964]  Lori in Washington, thanks for calling.
[01:48:52.964 --> 01:48:53.845]  Welcome.
[01:48:53.845 --> 01:48:56.587]  Hi Alex.
[01:48:56.587 --> 01:48:58.108]  Good to talk to you.
[01:48:59.136 --> 01:49:00.597]  I pray for you and your family.
[01:49:00.597 --> 01:49:04.258]  I can't thank you enough for all of your great supplements and your information.
[01:49:04.258 --> 01:49:05.479]  You've saved my life.
[01:49:05.479 --> 01:49:05.979]  Thank you.
[01:49:05.979 --> 01:49:07.560]  We love you.
[01:49:07.560 --> 01:49:09.000]  We're all working together.
[01:49:09.000 --> 01:49:09.841]  I know.
[01:49:09.841 --> 01:49:18.344]  I wanted to ask you, how do we hold these Congress people that pass through this young globalist program at the World Economic Forum?
[01:49:18.344 --> 01:49:21.025]  How do we get them to disavow that relationship?
[01:49:21.025 --> 01:49:23.066]  Well, you heard me with MTG.
[01:49:23.066 --> 01:49:23.847]  It is illegal.
[01:49:23.847 --> 01:49:24.507]  It violates
[01:49:24.787 --> 01:49:25.528]  We're good to go.
[01:49:48.726 --> 01:49:51.067]  Pledge Allegiance is the great reset and Build Back Better.
[01:49:51.067 --> 01:49:58.051]  You know, there's those videos where it goes one leader says Build Back Better and another one says Build Back Better and another one says Build Back Better until there's hundreds going Build Back Better!
[01:49:58.051 --> 01:49:58.551]  Build Back Better!
[01:49:58.551 --> 01:49:59.011]  Build Back Better!
[01:49:59.011 --> 01:50:00.092]  Build Back Better!
[01:50:00.092 --> 01:50:01.273]  Just like the Pfizer ads.
[01:50:01.273 --> 01:50:03.794]  They're all parroting the same thing and that's their agenda.
[01:50:03.794 --> 01:50:07.016]  That's their post-industrial world and I totally agree and we're so close.
[01:50:07.876 --> 01:50:14.741]  There are massive investigations out there about big tech and intelligence agencies surveilling and censoring people on hundreds of issues.
[01:50:14.741 --> 01:50:15.661]  Totally illegal.
[01:50:15.661 --> 01:50:17.643]  But who writes the talking points?
[01:50:17.643 --> 01:50:24.667]  The Demos Group, three months ago, was signed on as co-equal to the UN, advising the UN on policy.
[01:50:24.667 --> 01:50:31.412]  So, an unelected group runs the UN, has penetrated more than half the cabinets, and is trying to take global control.
[01:50:31.412 --> 01:50:33.653]  And now, they're meeting in Switzerland.
[01:50:33.653 --> 01:50:34.874]  They're meeting coming up.
[01:50:34.874 --> 01:50:37.556]  Swiss Army sends 5,000 soldiers to guard Demos.
[01:50:37.956 --> 01:50:38.277]  I agree.
[01:50:49.417 --> 01:51:00.062]  Put pressure on Congress, call talk radio, get a buzz, talk at your church, expose people like Dan Crenshaw that are part of it, and people that have been part of it, like Tulsi, that only went to one meeting.
[01:51:00.062 --> 01:51:02.363]  When she's young, they scoop her up, she's an up-and-comer.
[01:51:02.363 --> 01:51:03.944]  She's decried it, she's come out against it.
[01:51:03.944 --> 01:51:06.865]  We can forgive somebody that's been sucked in who comes out of it.
[01:51:06.865 --> 01:51:07.905]  That's key.
[01:51:07.905 --> 01:51:10.807]  We gotta have an open door for folks that want to defect back to the good side.
[01:51:10.807 --> 01:51:11.947]  You understand?
[01:51:11.947 --> 01:51:13.728]  Exactly.
[01:51:13.728 --> 01:51:15.309]  We gotta be forgiving, like Christ is.
[01:51:17.369 --> 01:51:17.929]  Does that make sense?
[01:51:17.929 --> 01:51:19.290]  Absolutely, absolutely.
[01:51:19.290 --> 01:51:20.391]  Thank you so much.
[01:51:20.391 --> 01:51:20.872]  Thank you.
[01:51:20.872 --> 01:51:23.874]  I mean, listen, I don't say this because I'm proud of it.
[01:51:23.874 --> 01:51:29.378]  I say it because it needs to be out there and I need to repent of it and I'm a sinner and I'm not perfect and Lord knows it.
[01:51:29.378 --> 01:51:31.820]  I get out of control, do things I shouldn't do, just like last segment.
[01:51:31.820 --> 01:51:34.021]  I never, very rarely, touched on it.
[01:51:34.021 --> 01:51:35.983]  But that's what Tucker said, so I was repeating it.
[01:51:35.983 --> 01:51:41.407]  The point is, is that I killed my children.
[01:51:42.685 --> 01:51:43.645]  I didn't know they were humans.
[01:51:43.645 --> 01:51:47.247]  I believed the lies when I was a teenager, got girls pregnant, and I repented of it.
[01:51:47.247 --> 01:51:51.868]  I had nightmares about it, and I've fought for life since then, but I don't think of myself as some goody-two-shoe.
[01:51:51.868 --> 01:51:53.589]  The left always says, why does Jones admit that?
[01:51:53.589 --> 01:51:54.489]  Why would he do that?
[01:51:54.489 --> 01:51:56.070]  It makes him look bad.
[01:51:56.070 --> 01:51:57.670]  No, no, it's the truth.
[01:51:57.670 --> 01:52:07.333]  It's that I'm a bad person, but I want to be good, and I'm asking Christ to purify me, sanctify me, and Christ has said, yes, I will forgive you.
[01:52:07.333 --> 01:52:08.274]  David in Virginia.
[01:52:08.274 --> 01:52:08.954]  David, you're on the air.
[01:52:08.954 --> 01:52:10.434]  Thanks for holding.
[01:52:10.434 --> 01:52:10.914]  Hey, Alex.
[01:52:10.914 --> 01:52:11.515]  How you doing, man?
[01:52:13.860 --> 01:52:18.804]  Yeah, I just like to pivot a little bit and talk about something that doesn't really get talked about too much.
[01:52:18.804 --> 01:52:23.608]  So like, five days ago, my sister overdosed on fentanyl.
[01:52:23.608 --> 01:52:36.739]  And the hospital protocol, I guess she came to, and then when she got to the hospital, they intubated her, put her on a ventilator, and put her back on fentanyl and propofol.
[01:52:36.739 --> 01:52:39.502]  I was just wondering what your opinion or thoughts were on that.
[01:52:39.502 --> 01:52:40.843]  Well, I mean, I'm not a
[01:52:43.570 --> 01:53:01.505]  Medical doctor who's an expert in that I mean just there's a whole school of medical three-year program just to know how to be anesthesiologist So I'm not gonna second-guess what they did, but a lot of people have bad reactions to fentanyl And they lay so many of the vape pens that are on the street with it and marijuana and stuff It's why I tell my children listen
[01:53:02.085 --> 01:53:07.367]  When I was growing up, my parents said, drugs are bad, but if you're going to experiment, do it with friends and you'll find out.
[01:53:07.367 --> 01:53:08.648]  And every drug I did, I hated.
[01:53:08.648 --> 01:53:10.149]  I mean, I did meth a few times, hated it.
[01:53:10.149 --> 01:53:11.249]  Did cocaine a few times, hated it.
[01:53:11.249 --> 01:53:13.670]  Did tobacco and alcohol, loved it.
[01:53:13.670 --> 01:53:15.451]  And caffeine, those are my things.
[01:53:15.451 --> 01:53:20.633]  But sitting there looking at that, it's just horrible.
[01:53:22.265 --> 01:53:25.146]  Over 130,000 deaths last year from fentanyl.
[01:53:25.146 --> 01:53:26.007]  They're shipping it in.
[01:53:26.007 --> 01:53:26.927]  Nothing's being done about it.
[01:53:26.927 --> 01:53:31.770]  I think there should be a death penalty for fentanyl dealers that knowingly put it on the street.
[01:53:31.770 --> 01:53:35.151]  Because even babies will be at a playground and put a little piece of it in their mouth.
[01:53:35.151 --> 01:53:37.132]  It'll kill them or put them in a coma.
[01:53:37.132 --> 01:53:41.294]  And the people doing this are putting a chemical weapon on the streets.
[01:53:41.294 --> 01:53:43.935]  And it's 100 times stronger than opium.
[01:53:43.935 --> 01:53:44.956]  It's about, what is it?
[01:53:45.216 --> 01:53:45.576]  We're good.
[01:54:03.573 --> 01:54:03.973]  Yeah, I agree.
[01:54:27.552 --> 01:54:32.353]  I'm just curious on why she's been like on a ventilator for like five days now.
[01:54:32.353 --> 01:54:33.954]  There's really no plan.
[01:54:33.954 --> 01:54:35.134]  They don't have a plan really.
[01:54:35.134 --> 01:54:36.654]  They're kind of just winging it.
[01:54:36.654 --> 01:54:43.196]  And then I talked to another girl who said she had a similar experience when her mom passed away and they were trying to file a lawsuit against John Randolph.
[01:54:43.196 --> 01:54:47.297]  Well what we know is they're using ventilators to kill people with these new protocols.
[01:54:47.297 --> 01:54:52.638]  So does your sister, did she stop breathing completely or why are they saying she's on a ventilator?
[01:54:54.161 --> 01:54:56.221]  Well, that's what I'm trying to figure out.
[01:54:56.221 --> 01:55:08.383]  The chain of events that led up to it because apparently she came to and they said she was in an altered state of consciousness so then they basically just put her back on fentanyl and propofol and just kind of just left her.
[01:55:08.383 --> 01:55:09.984]  I mean, I don't know.
[01:55:09.984 --> 01:55:12.384]  She's in a medically induced coma.
[01:55:12.384 --> 01:55:14.104]  Well, that doesn't sound good to me, buddy.
[01:55:14.104 --> 01:55:15.525]  I would get up there.
[01:55:15.525 --> 01:55:16.625]  I would start speaking out.
[01:55:16.625 --> 01:55:17.685]  I'd bullhorn the hospital.
[01:55:17.685 --> 01:55:18.945]  They don't listen to you.
[01:55:18.945 --> 01:55:20.065]  You know, from the edge of the street.
[01:55:20.065 --> 01:55:22.846]  I'd call the news media and let them know they're being watched, brother.
[01:55:24.369 --> 01:55:24.869]  Let me do this.
[01:55:24.869 --> 01:55:28.690]  Give me your name and number, and I want to tell the crew, I want to call you back.
[01:55:28.690 --> 01:55:31.851]  I'm going to do a special Saturday show with a special guest.
[01:55:31.851 --> 01:55:33.592]  Guys, don't let me forget this, please.
[01:55:33.592 --> 01:55:34.792]  This guy's counting on us.
[01:55:34.792 --> 01:55:41.034]  I want an update on your family member, and we will call you back on Saturday, okay?
[01:55:41.034 --> 01:55:41.374]  Okay.
[01:55:41.374 --> 01:55:42.314]  Thank you so much, Alex.
[01:55:42.314 --> 01:55:43.254]  God bless you.
[01:55:43.254 --> 01:55:44.275]  Where is this exactly?
[01:55:44.275 --> 01:55:46.115]  Where is this happening?
[01:55:46.115 --> 01:55:48.776]  This is in Virginia, like 30 minutes south of Richmond.
[01:55:49.161 --> 01:55:50.923]  Do you know how she got the fentanyl?
[01:55:50.923 --> 01:55:53.565]  Or did she knowingly took it or was it laced?
[01:55:53.565 --> 01:55:56.808]  She was a drug user and bathed in fentanyl.
[01:55:56.808 --> 01:56:01.312]  She's an adult, she made her own decisions.
[01:56:01.312 --> 01:56:08.699]  Previous experiences with people overdosed and they kind of come to after they get Narcan and then they're kind of like on their way back to the street.
[01:56:13.404 --> 01:56:19.108]  We've had whistleblower nurses on from New York where they would get a homeless person who didn't even have COVID.
[01:56:19.108 --> 01:56:20.729]  They'd be COVID negative.
[01:56:20.729 --> 01:56:23.150]  They'd still put them on a ventilator because they had no friends.
[01:56:23.150 --> 01:56:26.612]  Then they get the $53,000 or $51,000 to kill them.
[01:56:26.612 --> 01:56:29.874]  So I know in that case they were murdering people in key Democrat states.
[01:56:29.874 --> 01:56:31.395]  I hope that's not happening to Virginia, brother.
[01:56:31.395 --> 01:56:32.456]  God bless you.
[01:56:32.456 --> 01:56:33.557]  Give us your name and number if you want.
[01:56:33.557 --> 01:56:35.918]  We'll call you back on Saturday and check on the situation.
[01:56:35.918 --> 01:56:37.659]  If things are going bad, you can name the hospital.
[01:56:37.659 --> 01:56:38.440]  You can talk about it, okay?
[01:56:40.202 --> 01:56:41.563]  Yeah, we're good to go.
[01:57:04.355 --> 01:57:06.696]  Andrew Tate or any of those kind of people that gets tens of millions of views.
[01:57:06.696 --> 01:57:08.557]  So I think this is going to be a big interview.
[01:57:08.557 --> 01:57:09.838]  We'll be able to talk about a lot of stuff.
[01:57:09.838 --> 01:57:11.018]  Could be fiery.
[01:57:11.018 --> 01:57:12.739]  I'm going to try to be friendly and just actually be nice.
[01:57:12.739 --> 01:57:17.482]  But if he's not nice, I'll do what I did 10 years ago and I'll mop the floor with him.
[01:57:17.482 --> 01:57:24.325]  Speaking of Andrew Tate, in the New York Post, two of the six women contacted by the media that say he raped them and all this say none of it's true.
[01:57:24.325 --> 01:57:25.345]  It's all lies.
[01:57:25.345 --> 01:57:28.067]  And they're saying they know some of the other women and that's not true either.
[01:57:28.067 --> 01:57:28.207]  See?
[01:57:29.526 --> 01:57:34.049]  Uh, so, Andrew Tate accusers claim they made clear they're not victims.
[01:57:34.049 --> 01:57:36.890]  And they said they're being listed as victims, and it's not true.
[01:57:36.890 --> 01:57:37.390]  Ha, see?
[01:57:37.390 --> 01:57:38.611]  Ha ha!
[01:57:38.611 --> 01:57:40.072]  I mean, he could be guilty.
[01:57:40.072 --> 01:57:40.892]  I don't think he is.
[01:57:40.892 --> 01:57:43.874]  This thing stinks to high heaven, and this is a big piece going towards that.
[01:57:43.874 --> 01:57:45.235]  So, pray for Andrew Tate.
[01:57:45.235 --> 01:57:45.635]  Be right back.
[01:57:48.823 --> 01:58:01.471]  Mark Twain, one of America's greatest writers and satirists and minds, famously said more than 150 years ago, rumors of his demise had been greatly exaggerated.
[01:58:01.471 --> 01:58:04.653]  Because the newspapers kept saying he died decades before he did die.
[01:58:05.453 --> 01:58:07.754]  And it's the same PSYOP today.
[01:58:07.754 --> 01:58:15.337]  InfoWars is more influential and more powerful than ever because of your support, because the facts of what we've covered is coming true.
[01:58:15.337 --> 01:58:24.160]  But if they can convince you we've been shut down, if they can convince you that we're going away, and you stop supporting, you stop spreading the word, then they do win.
[01:58:24.160 --> 01:58:29.842]  Ladies and gentlemen, there's only one group of people that can shut down InfoWars, and that's you, the viewers and listeners.
[01:58:30.342 --> 01:58:32.283]  If you decide we're done, we're done.
[01:58:32.283 --> 01:58:39.549]  If you decide to go to InfoWarsTore.com and get supplements and books and films and t-shirts and so much more, we will stay on the air indefinitely.
[01:58:39.549 --> 01:58:40.970]  It is all in your hands.
[01:58:40.970 --> 01:58:42.291]  So thanks for your support.
[01:58:42.291 --> 01:58:43.512]  Stand up against the globalists.
[01:58:43.512 --> 01:58:46.774]  Go to InfoWarsTore.com right now and keep us on air.
[01:58:46.774 --> 01:58:49.236]  It's up to you.
[01:58:49.236 --> 01:58:53.819]  Why does the establishment spend so much time demonizing InfoWars?
[01:58:53.819 --> 01:58:56.101]  Attacking myself and the crew and our other hosts?
[01:58:56.892 --> 01:58:58.953]  Because they know we're pro-human.
[01:58:58.953 --> 01:59:00.654]  They know we're telling the truth.
[01:59:00.654 --> 01:59:02.215]  They know we've got their number.
[01:59:02.215 --> 01:59:06.938]  They know everything we do is about empowering humanity.
[01:59:06.938 --> 01:59:14.823]  And God gave us, through Mother Nature, incredible compounds that will supercharge our body's stamina, libido, energy, and immune systems.
[01:59:14.823 --> 01:59:25.229]  And we came out many years ago with Real Red Pill Plus that has all the documented compounds like preglanone and so much more to supercharge your body.
[01:59:26.209 --> 01:59:26.509]  Thank you.
[01:59:50.399 --> 01:59:59.044]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:59:59.044 --> 02:00:02.766]  Humanity is in a very dangerous position right now.
[02:00:02.766 --> 02:00:10.630]  Powerful corporations using military-grade psychological warfare programs are rolling out a biomedical tyranny worldwide.
[02:00:10.630 --> 02:00:16.394]  At World ID, a cashless society, a social credit score, a universal basic income,
[02:00:16.874 --> 02:00:21.376]  Where every facet of your life is tracked, surveilled, and controlled.
[02:00:21.376 --> 02:00:31.382]  If you think the censorship and surveillance you've seen so far by the deep state and big tech was bad, that is just the opening salvo of their attack.
[02:00:31.382 --> 02:00:38.426]  Humanity and all of our hard-fought liberties and freedoms and all of our safeguards are literally on the edge of a cliff.
[02:00:40.026 --> 02:00:46.909]  But without InfoWars on the air, the general public is not going to be aware of the enemy operations.
[02:00:46.909 --> 02:00:52.811]  We didn't just tell you about this whole poison shot rollout first, three years ago, on record.
[02:00:52.811 --> 02:00:55.192]  We're also telling you what's coming next.
[02:00:55.192 --> 02:00:56.552]  We track the enemy.
[02:00:56.552 --> 02:01:01.854]  They're preparing new bioweapon releases and new poison mRNA frankenshots.
[02:01:01.854 --> 02:01:06.956]  Ladies and gentlemen, my family, your family, is at the edge of a cliff.
[02:01:06.956 --> 02:01:08.437]  Bill Gates, Klaus Schwab,
[02:01:08.717 --> 02:01:20.839]  The UN, the WHO is literally pushing us over into that Castle Society hell grid, into that biomedical tyranny that will be even worse than what you see in Communist China that is the current main laboratory of this control.
[02:01:20.839 --> 02:01:23.340]  We have to first recognize there is a cliff.
[02:01:23.340 --> 02:01:28.441]  We have to recognize that millions of people have been forced into these deadly shots and pushed over the cliff and died.
[02:01:28.441 --> 02:01:33.522]  Tens of millions more are sick and dying from these poisonous shots.
[02:01:33.522 --> 02:01:37.803]  Every one of you watching knows someone who took the shot and died or who became deathly ill.
[02:01:38.243 --> 02:01:41.265]  And their own documents show they know this is deadly.
[02:01:41.265 --> 02:01:41.886]  And what do they do?
[02:01:41.886 --> 02:01:43.247]  They push and push and push.
[02:01:43.247 --> 02:01:47.650]  And say, well, it's up to you, but we'll take your rights and freedoms away if you don't take it.
[02:01:47.650 --> 02:01:51.573]  Stand up to the tyrants who think they own your body, but they own my body.
[02:01:51.573 --> 02:01:56.537]  And spread the word and share the articles and the videos like your life depends on it from InfoWars.com.
[02:01:56.537 --> 02:01:57.418]  Because it does!
[02:01:59.096 --> 02:02:11.761]  Mark Twain, one of America's greatest writers and satirists and minds, famously said more than 150 years ago, rumors of his demise had been greatly exaggerated.
[02:02:11.761 --> 02:02:14.943]  Because the newspapers kept saying he died decades before he did die.
[02:02:15.743 --> 02:02:18.045]  And it's the same PSYOP today.
[02:02:18.045 --> 02:02:25.609]  InfoWars is more influential and more powerful than ever because of your support and because of the facts that we've covered is coming true.
[02:02:25.609 --> 02:02:34.455]  But if they can convince you we've been shut down, if they can convince you that we're going away, and you stop supporting, you stop spreading the word, then they do win.
[02:02:34.455 --> 02:02:36.356]  Ladies and gentlemen, there's only one group
[02:02:36.676 --> 02:02:37.056]  I don't know.
[02:02:59.189 --> 02:03:07.174]  Well, the Bill of Rights is a stumbling block on the way to shutting down speech that the left doesn't like, at least in government.
[02:03:07.174 --> 02:03:12.958]  But there's a new avenue for those who would like to censor what you say and think, and that's corporations.
[02:03:12.958 --> 02:03:15.300]  The left have wised up to this.
[02:03:15.300 --> 02:03:20.724]  If you want to stop someone from telling the truth, use companies to do it.
[02:03:20.724 --> 02:03:22.065]  The social media giants.
[02:03:22.065 --> 02:03:22.445]  And they are.
[02:03:22.805 --> 02:03:28.548]  For many on the left, the view seems to have become that if you can't beat him, it prevents him from speaking.
[02:03:28.548 --> 02:03:33.371]  So far the most prominent casualty of the crusade against free expression has been the radio show host Alex Jones.
[02:03:33.371 --> 02:03:40.995]  There is a concerted effort by the Democratic Party and multinational corporations and big tech to silence conservative and nationalist and populist voices.
[02:03:41.135 --> 02:03:47.179]  There's also guys on CNN that spend their whole day calling Facebook and saying, can you ban this person?
[02:03:47.179 --> 02:03:54.224]  He may be America's best-known conspiracy theorist, but this week, Alex Jones' content will be a little harder to find.
[02:03:54.224 --> 02:04:04.031]  Shame on the mainstream corporate media for not defending the First Amendment, but instead attack-dogging, calling for federal regulators to shut down independent, free press working with big tech.
[02:04:04.631 --> 02:04:06.131]  People know what's true.
[02:04:06.131 --> 02:04:07.452]  They can smell it.
[02:04:07.452 --> 02:04:12.894]  InfoWars, the most banned network in the world.
[02:04:12.894 --> 02:04:14.874]  In a free country, everyone can be heard.
[02:04:14.874 --> 02:04:18.475]  In totalitarian societies, only the powerful can be heard.
[02:04:52.321 --> 02:04:53.089]  Okay, okay.
[02:04:59.690 --> 02:05:03.612]  Ladies and gentlemen, a very exciting development has just taken place.
[02:05:03.612 --> 02:05:12.497]  I want to encourage you all to go to InfoWarsTore.com and check it out for yourself because it is a very strong, high-quality formula.
[02:05:12.497 --> 02:05:17.559]  Down-and-out sleep support, liquid, it's very fast-acting, take it under the tongue.
[02:05:17.559 --> 02:05:25.844]  It's got a very good dose of melatonin, passionflower, valerian root extract, lemon balm, and German chamomile.
[02:05:25.844 --> 02:05:28.005]  All of these compounds are documented on record
[02:05:28.365 --> 02:05:28.745]  I think so.
[02:06:01.206 --> 02:06:07.347]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[02:06:07.347 --> 02:06:15.569]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[02:06:15.569 --> 02:06:18.430]  Well, I met him at the three-week American tour.
[02:06:18.430 --> 02:06:19.670]  I was already fully aware of his work.
[02:06:19.670 --> 02:06:21.791]  I got a huge response when I was on his show.
[02:06:22.791 --> 02:06:36.444]  He's Pastor Dave Scarlett and he's here, he's moved to Texas from Ohio and he has HisGlory.me and it reaches over 25 million people every single week, conservatively.
[02:06:36.444 --> 02:06:44.432]  The pastors of this nation, I'm very critical, a lot of the mainline churches not exposing the New World Order, but I gotta say more and more they are, but this guy's hardcore.
[02:06:44.432 --> 02:06:46.794]  But even mainline big mega churches I've gone to,
[02:06:47.635 --> 02:06:59.770]  I went to church a lot with Jesse James here at some of the big churches and some of the others and I go in now to those churches I went to years ago and they weren't talking about these issues, they're talking about the Great Reset and the Antichrist and the Catholic Society and all of it now.
[02:06:59.770 --> 02:07:04.095]  So it seems to me there's a revival, not just of Christ and the Bible, but what
[02:07:04.756 --> 02:07:07.077]  The revelations warns us of, and people really get this.
[02:07:07.077 --> 02:07:10.018]  So Pastor Dave Scarlett, really appreciate you being here with us today.
[02:07:10.018 --> 02:07:11.739]  I want to invite you back anytime.
[02:07:11.739 --> 02:07:14.079]  I know you coast a lot with General Flynn.
[02:07:14.079 --> 02:07:15.060]  We love him.
[02:07:15.060 --> 02:07:16.580]  We appreciate him.
[02:07:16.580 --> 02:07:19.061]  You went and stayed in a tent, I guess, down on the border.
[02:07:19.061 --> 02:07:20.762]  Shot some incredible footage.
[02:07:20.762 --> 02:07:22.843]  Wherever you want to go with us, we've got some amazing B-roll.
[02:07:24.209 --> 02:07:25.650]  You're a smart guy.
[02:07:25.650 --> 02:07:28.711]  What is your view on the state of the world, the state of the fight against evil?
[02:07:28.711 --> 02:07:36.814]  It seems to me there is breakthroughs with criminal investigations and the shots and people waking up on so many fronts, but the devil's just pulling out all the stops.
[02:07:36.814 --> 02:07:43.076]  If you were, say, you know, Madden, the football commentator here at the Super Bowl, how would you describe the current place we're at?
[02:07:43.696 --> 02:07:48.878]  I would say we're fourth down and one from the one, and there's one second on the clock.
[02:07:48.878 --> 02:07:50.598]  There's no time left.
[02:07:50.598 --> 02:07:58.061]  We need to be all in to get this country back in the name of Jesus Christ and get this Eagle Nation back.
[02:07:58.061 --> 02:08:03.982]  We're on the precipice of losing it for good, and that's why we have to be all in and take action.
[02:08:03.982 --> 02:08:05.443]  God, family, country.
[02:08:05.443 --> 02:08:07.984]  Absolutely.
[02:08:07.984 --> 02:08:09.904]  You've got the floor, because I'll talk forever.
[02:08:09.904 --> 02:08:11.665]  I've been on your show, amazing things you do.
[02:08:13.029 --> 02:08:15.232]  What are the most important issues for you right now?
[02:08:15.232 --> 02:08:19.076]  Well, it's getting people to realize how important these times are.
[02:08:19.076 --> 02:08:22.900]  And I tell people today, this is the greatest time in the history of the world to be alive.
[02:08:22.900 --> 02:08:23.861]  But you have to take action.
[02:08:23.861 --> 02:08:27.125]  If you're going to sit back and be on the fence, you're going to be out.
[02:08:27.125 --> 02:08:31.049]  If you are in the front line, in the fight, and that's what we need to do to get this country back is fight.
[02:08:31.550 --> 02:08:32.691]  And we've got to stand forward.
[02:08:32.691 --> 02:08:36.332]  If you're involved, we're going to make things change.
[02:08:36.332 --> 02:08:39.234]  You mentioned earlier that there is breakthroughs coming.
[02:08:39.234 --> 02:08:40.654]  And we've got to keep our foot on the pedal.
[02:08:40.654 --> 02:08:42.215]  We've got to keep moving.
[02:08:42.215 --> 02:08:47.297]  Because the church has put us in a situation, as you said Alex, that the church was asleep at the wheel.
[02:08:47.297 --> 02:08:51.119]  There wasn't enough pastors behind the pulpits telling the truth.
[02:08:51.119 --> 02:08:54.161]  They conformed to the government, and that's the situation we're in today.
[02:08:54.901 --> 02:08:56.541]  They weren't going to tell the truth.
[02:08:56.541 --> 02:09:01.003]  The Lord had to use me as a marine and come from the corporate world to be a pastor.
[02:09:01.003 --> 02:09:04.243]  But whatever it takes, we're going to do it for His purpose and His glory.
[02:09:04.243 --> 02:09:05.564]  And people are waking up.
[02:09:05.564 --> 02:09:09.025]  We go to these reawaken events and thousands and thousands of people come.
[02:09:09.025 --> 02:09:09.725]  Millions come in.
[02:09:09.725 --> 02:09:14.466]  We have patriots coming in and accepting Jesus Christ as their Lord and Savior.
[02:09:14.966 --> 02:09:22.952]  We have Christians coming in that don't know how to be patriots, are learning the Constitution, waking up to say, what can I do to take action?
[02:09:22.952 --> 02:09:25.253]  I mentioned General Flynn, that's what he says every day.
[02:09:25.253 --> 02:09:26.694]  What are you going to do to take action?
[02:09:26.694 --> 02:09:29.516]  And that's a big leftist lie that this wasn't a Christian nation.
[02:09:29.516 --> 02:09:35.480]  We allowed freedom of religion under the First Amendment, but it was undoubtedly founded on Christian values.
[02:09:35.480 --> 02:09:36.501]  Absolutely.
[02:09:36.501 --> 02:09:38.342]  Judeo-Christian values, that's what the U.S.
[02:09:38.342 --> 02:09:39.003]  Constitution is.
[02:09:39.423 --> 02:09:43.164]  And that was the original, the original pastors were called the Black Robe Regiment.
[02:09:43.164 --> 02:09:46.264]  They had a musket in one hand and a Bible in the other.
[02:09:46.264 --> 02:09:48.365]  And we've lost that, and it's time to get that back.
[02:09:48.365 --> 02:09:49.665]  Or we will not have a country.
[02:09:49.665 --> 02:09:57.066]  So do you agree with me, because you're more immersed in the clergy and the church than I am a hundred times, that I'm seeing finally some awakening in the church?
[02:09:57.066 --> 02:09:57.606]  Yes.
[02:09:57.606 --> 02:09:59.247]  Because I go to random churches all the time.
[02:09:59.247 --> 02:10:01.347]  I mean, I'm the type of guy that doesn't go to the same one all the time.
[02:10:01.347 --> 02:10:04.368]  I go to church sometimes twice a week, usually once a week.
[02:10:04.368 --> 02:10:06.828]  I just go to friends' churches, and I'm just seeing big awakening.
[02:10:07.328 --> 02:10:08.048]  Absolutely.
[02:10:08.048 --> 02:10:12.150]  We see a remnant church standing up right now, and you see a conforming church.
[02:10:12.150 --> 02:10:16.272]  You know, the last two and a half years have been really tough for people, but we're seeing a separation.
[02:10:16.272 --> 02:10:21.055]  God is using this time to separate the fake from the truth of His pulpit.
[02:10:21.055 --> 02:10:31.860]  And those churches that are standing up for truth are growing, and they don't care about their tax status, they don't care about the money coming in, they care about truth, and that is the Bible and this
[02:10:32.620 --> 02:10:33.841]  Well, here's a microcosm.
[02:10:33.841 --> 02:10:43.887]  My mother was raised Southern Baptist by her dad, but her mom, we've been here in Texas forever, had been, you know, her family gone to the First Methodist Church in downtown Austin since, you know, her grandmother did.
[02:10:43.887 --> 02:10:45.868]  So they would go a few times a year to that.
[02:10:45.868 --> 02:10:51.092]  And my mom was a member, gave them money, but they went full communist with literal drag queen story time.
[02:10:51.092 --> 02:10:54.614]  She got out of the church before that happened, but she literally cried about it.
[02:10:55.294 --> 02:10:56.714]  And so she was really dejected.
[02:10:56.714 --> 02:10:59.395]  And I said, Mom, go to some other churches and see what you like.
[02:10:59.395 --> 02:11:05.637]  She went to a big, huge church in Round Rock where they had 5,000 inside, 5,000 or so outside with jumbotrons.
[02:11:05.637 --> 02:11:09.498]  And the preacher was talking about the New World Order and the Mark of the Beast and the globalists.
[02:11:09.498 --> 02:11:13.499]  You need to get back to the land and food and that all this is happening.
[02:11:13.499 --> 02:11:16.660]  And she was so excited that she went to a big church in Round Rock.
[02:11:16.660 --> 02:11:17.660]  I hadn't been there yet.
[02:11:17.660 --> 02:11:20.881]  And it was like an hour and a half, fire and brimstone preaching.
[02:11:20.881 --> 02:11:21.381]  She loved it.
[02:11:21.701 --> 02:11:27.864]  So again, a lot of churches aren't churches anymore, they're leftist outposts, but others are reawakening.
[02:11:27.864 --> 02:11:31.925]  Well, you have 20% of churches today that take a biblical worldview.
[02:11:31.925 --> 02:11:32.705]  That's it.
[02:11:32.705 --> 02:11:32.966]  20%.
[02:11:32.966 --> 02:11:36.827]  That means 80% have fallen into conforming.
[02:11:36.827 --> 02:11:39.088]  If you don't take a biblical worldview, how can you trust the Bible?
[02:11:39.088 --> 02:11:39.608]  Let me explain.
[02:11:39.608 --> 02:11:45.871]  The First Methodist Church of Austin has drag queen story time for kids at Sunday school.
[02:11:45.871 --> 02:11:48.312]  And people think that's okay?
[02:11:48.312 --> 02:11:50.773]  Literal, a pedophilic movement in a so-called church.
[02:11:50.773 --> 02:11:51.333]  They've captured it.
[02:11:53.953 --> 02:11:54.954]  That is so evil.
[02:11:54.954 --> 02:11:59.997]  Think about the folks that paid to build that church 180 years ago and now it's that.
[02:11:59.997 --> 02:12:01.398]  That's right.
[02:12:01.398 --> 02:12:04.760]  So how do we, what's the moment in history we've reached and what do we do?
[02:12:04.760 --> 02:12:08.502]  This moment in history is where we have to be the Church of Philadelphia.
[02:12:08.502 --> 02:12:13.585]  We have to not deny his name, do not deny his word, we have to get in the word.
[02:12:13.585 --> 02:12:18.448]  One of, again, the problems is we see modern day cemeteries, I call them, seminaries.
[02:12:18.448 --> 02:12:22.571]  Forty-five percent of all new pastors in the United States of America do not believe in a literal hell.
[02:12:23.371 --> 02:12:26.132]  When you start doing that, the Bible falls apart.
[02:12:26.132 --> 02:12:27.912]  We need to start teaching the Book of Revelation.
[02:12:27.912 --> 02:12:29.032]  Oh, and we forget God!
[02:12:29.032 --> 02:12:30.352]  Hell is actually here, too!
[02:12:30.352 --> 02:12:32.433]  Yes, exactly.
[02:12:32.433 --> 02:12:37.874]  And I've had so many questions from people that are not even Christians about the Book of Revelation in the last two and a half years.
[02:12:37.874 --> 02:12:39.094]  Tell me more about this thesis.
[02:12:39.094 --> 02:12:40.014]  Well, that's what I'm seeing.
[02:12:40.014 --> 02:12:47.176]  We have record listeners that say, you led me to Christ, Alex, without even trying, because they see the Bible being fulfilled on this broadcast.
[02:12:47.176 --> 02:12:48.256]  It is, right before our very eyes.
[02:12:48.676 --> 02:12:50.657]  Nobody thought it would happen this soon.
[02:12:50.657 --> 02:12:54.639]  I mean, three, four years ago, you thought, what's this Antichrist fellow that's gonna come out and sing?
[02:12:54.639 --> 02:12:56.320]  How could he fool the world?
[02:12:56.320 --> 02:12:57.560]  Well, welcome to 2023.
[02:12:57.560 --> 02:12:59.481]  We're seeing it right before our very eyes.
[02:12:59.481 --> 02:13:02.843]  And a lot of preachers say, well, praise God, don't fight it, Jesus is coming back.
[02:13:02.843 --> 02:13:05.724]  I say, praise God, as soon as Jesus comes, that's the better.
[02:13:05.724 --> 02:13:08.265]  But at the same time, we're supposed to do something in this time.
[02:13:08.265 --> 02:13:10.106]  What are we supposed to do biblically during these end times?
[02:13:10.612 --> 02:13:13.294]  This is what the Lord tells us to do in Mark 16, 15.
[02:13:13.294 --> 02:13:16.957]  Preach the gospel from east to west to north to south to every creature.
[02:13:16.957 --> 02:13:21.740]  Didn't say stand back and politely clap and go to Sunday school and then leave.
[02:13:21.740 --> 02:13:25.563]  We have to take action and take his word to the world.
[02:13:25.563 --> 02:13:29.326]  Into the tough places, whether it's the border, whether it's Iran.
[02:13:29.326 --> 02:13:30.647]  Because the people are ready now.
[02:13:30.647 --> 02:13:31.287]  They're ready.
[02:13:31.287 --> 02:13:32.188]  They're ready for revival.
[02:13:32.188 --> 02:13:36.271]  We're in a spirit of revival like this country's never seen since back to the day.
[02:13:36.271 --> 02:13:38.653]  What does your spirit, what does the Holy Spirit tell you is about to happen?
[02:13:38.973 --> 02:13:40.074]  We're going to have the greatest revival.
[02:13:40.074 --> 02:13:41.294]  Well, several things.
[02:13:41.294 --> 02:13:43.415]  It's going to get darker.
[02:13:43.415 --> 02:13:45.456]  There's going to be much more exposure coming.
[02:13:45.456 --> 02:13:46.817]  There's going to be judgment coming.
[02:13:46.817 --> 02:13:49.258]  And we're going to see a revival like the world has never seen.
[02:13:49.258 --> 02:13:51.659]  And God's allowing that to force us to make the choice.
[02:13:51.659 --> 02:13:52.700]  Exactly.
[02:13:52.700 --> 02:13:54.200]  What's most important in our lives?
[02:13:54.200 --> 02:13:55.241]  Is it God?
[02:13:55.241 --> 02:13:57.242]  Or is it the world that we've been conformed to?
[02:13:57.242 --> 02:14:05.266]  We've been channeled, programmed by the fake news and all the other... And people that keep serving evil, and I'm not perfect, but I certainly choose God, they need to know it's a trap.
[02:14:05.266 --> 02:14:07.307]  The more you give in to the devil, the more he's going to demand.
[02:14:08.817 --> 02:14:10.058]  That's right.
[02:14:10.058 --> 02:14:10.979]  That's right.
[02:14:10.979 --> 02:14:15.722]  And not only demand, as long as you're off on the side, if you're asleep, that's what he wants.
[02:14:15.722 --> 02:14:18.785]  That's the problem right now we have in the United States and the world.
[02:14:18.785 --> 02:14:19.905]  We're indifferent.
[02:14:19.905 --> 02:14:20.726]  That's the Church of later.
[02:14:20.726 --> 02:14:22.167]  That's the screw tape letters.
[02:14:22.167 --> 02:14:22.828]  Yeah.
[02:14:22.828 --> 02:14:23.708]  Indifferent.
[02:14:23.708 --> 02:14:24.749]  You're indifferent.
[02:14:24.749 --> 02:14:27.591]  Indifferent is the worst thing you could possibly be in life.
[02:14:27.591 --> 02:14:29.653]  You're either all in or you're all out.
[02:14:29.653 --> 02:14:30.573]  Well Christ said that.
[02:14:30.573 --> 02:14:31.314]  You're lukewarm.
[02:14:31.314 --> 02:14:32.755]  I spit you out of my mouth.
[02:14:32.755 --> 02:14:33.796]  To the Church of later to see you.
[02:14:35.111 --> 02:14:36.532]  That's the church age we're in today.
[02:14:36.532 --> 02:14:42.376]  Correct me if I'm wrong, Son of God is saying you're worse than evil to sit on the fence.
[02:14:42.376 --> 02:14:43.037]  Exactly.
[02:14:43.037 --> 02:14:44.177]  Explain that to me.
[02:14:44.177 --> 02:14:49.461]  The reason is because at least when you know evil is evil and evil calls evil, you know they're evil.
[02:14:49.461 --> 02:14:52.083]  The worst is that the person that sits on the fence goes both ways.
[02:14:52.083 --> 02:14:55.345]  They're going to, you know, I'll get here when you get here.
[02:14:55.345 --> 02:14:57.266]  I'll read the Bible if it fits my needs.
[02:14:57.266 --> 02:14:57.967]  You're lukewarm.
[02:14:58.467 --> 02:14:59.368]  You're not in.
[02:14:59.368 --> 02:15:00.408]  You've got to be all in.
[02:15:00.408 --> 02:15:02.830]  And the ones, obviously, he wants are the ones that are all in for him.
[02:15:02.830 --> 02:15:05.351]  Because there's nothing more frustrating than somebody that keeps jerking you around.
[02:15:05.351 --> 02:15:05.791]  Exactly.
[02:15:05.791 --> 02:15:10.234]  Nothing more frustrating than somebody that's indifferent about anything in life.
[02:15:10.234 --> 02:15:11.034]  Take a stand.
[02:15:11.034 --> 02:15:12.135]  Take action.
[02:15:12.135 --> 02:15:14.196]  At least the enemy's all in for Satan.
[02:15:14.196 --> 02:15:14.756]  That's right.
[02:15:14.756 --> 02:15:15.137]  Satan.
[02:15:15.137 --> 02:15:16.357]  You know his plan.
[02:15:16.357 --> 02:15:17.938]  It's to destroy man.
[02:15:17.938 --> 02:15:18.679]  That's the fall.
[02:15:18.679 --> 02:15:20.400]  And boy, isn't that all illustrated now?
[02:15:20.400 --> 02:15:22.701]  The globalists rule the Earth, but they want to destroy it.
[02:15:24.246 --> 02:15:25.047]  Why is that?
[02:15:25.047 --> 02:15:28.028]  Because they have their marching orders from Satan, the 13 bloodlines.
[02:15:28.028 --> 02:15:29.670]  It all comes back to the Garden of Eden.
[02:15:29.670 --> 02:15:31.311]  But Satan knows he's a loser.
[02:15:31.311 --> 02:15:32.071]  Why is he doing it?
[02:15:32.071 --> 02:15:34.913]  Let's talk about it when we come back and what you saw on the border.
[02:15:34.913 --> 02:15:38.115]  Pastor Dave Scarlett, I'm so glad that you're here in town.
[02:15:38.115 --> 02:15:39.636]  HisGlory.me, folks.
[02:15:39.636 --> 02:15:41.197]  Powerful TV program.
[02:15:41.197 --> 02:15:42.678]  Some of the most hardcore stuff out there.
[02:15:42.678 --> 02:15:43.839]  I'm so blessed you're here.
[02:15:43.839 --> 02:15:47.081]  Anytime I want to use the studio, anytime you want to come down here, we'd love to have you.
[02:15:47.081 --> 02:15:47.781]  I'd love it.
[02:15:47.781 --> 02:15:48.422]  We'll be right back.
[02:15:48.422 --> 02:15:48.802]  Stay with us.
[02:15:58.823 --> 02:16:03.366]  I'm taking a lot of supplements over the years, since high school, and they had great effects.
[02:16:03.366 --> 02:16:07.069]  And the science has gotten better and better and better over the years.
[02:16:07.069 --> 02:16:17.897]  And now with all the things we're bombarded with, and the water and the food and the feminizing factors, it is more important than ever to use the compounds God gave us to boost our natural male potential.
[02:16:17.897 --> 02:16:19.198]  These products work great for women as well.
[02:16:19.858 --> 02:16:22.259]  Ladies and gentlemen, we have Pain MD.
[02:16:22.259 --> 02:16:24.739]  It's a number one national bestseller under another name.
[02:16:24.739 --> 02:16:30.541]  We got it discounted for 40% off at InfoWarsTore.com under the label InfoWars Platinum.
[02:16:30.541 --> 02:16:32.801]  We've also got HGH Max Boost.
[02:16:32.801 --> 02:16:34.102]  Read all about it.
[02:16:34.102 --> 02:16:35.462]  Be very safe with it.
[02:16:35.462 --> 02:16:38.883]  I'd take only a fraction of what they say at first and take it before you go to bed at night.
[02:16:38.883 --> 02:16:40.403]  Don't do it during the day.
[02:16:40.403 --> 02:16:43.424]  1776 Testosterone Boost.
[02:16:43.424 --> 02:16:44.484]  Totally incredible.
[02:16:44.484 --> 02:16:45.425]  Go read about them.
[02:16:45.425 --> 02:16:46.205]  Learn more about them.
[02:16:46.485 --> 02:16:47.245]  Thank you.
[02:16:59.889 --> 02:17:04.731]  I have been in a 28-year marathon battle with the globalists.
[02:17:04.731 --> 02:17:11.153]  I have come from nowhere, to the very heights of politics, not just in America, but in the world.
[02:17:11.153 --> 02:17:16.275]  We are engaging the globalists at point-blank range in the information war.
[02:17:16.275 --> 02:17:17.976]  But I don't deserve the credit.
[02:17:17.976 --> 02:17:19.036]  Yes, I persevered.
[02:17:19.036 --> 02:17:24.418]  But the listeners and viewers who supported InfoWars are the real reason we've had this success.
[02:17:25.118 --> 02:17:30.561]  We're having now the greatest victories in the fight against the New World Order we've ever had.
[02:17:30.561 --> 02:17:34.863]  We are now entering the final mile of the marathon.
[02:17:34.863 --> 02:17:44.108]  And that's why, today, it's more important than ever to realize how important you've been in this fight and to continue in the efforts you've been carrying out and to intensify them.
[02:17:44.108 --> 02:17:45.469]  God bless you all.
[02:17:45.469 --> 02:17:46.509]  I salute you.
[02:17:46.509 --> 02:17:47.430]  I thank you.
[02:17:47.430 --> 02:17:53.333]  And I beg you to intensify what you're doing now because we are over the target and history is happening.
[02:17:53.614 --> 02:17:54.942]  The fight is my fight.
[02:17:54.942 --> 02:17:55.586]  It's your fight.
[02:17:55.586 --> 02:17:56.331]  It's our fight.
[02:17:56.331 --> 02:17:57.096]  God bless you all.

[02:19:19.543 --> 02:19:25.008]  That's because we go right to the highest quality manufacturer in the nation that supplies some of the top names.
[02:19:25.008 --> 02:19:27.730]  They then give us the best deal out there, because the owner's a listener,

[02:19:30.392 --> 02:19:35.556]  You're not going to find 1,000 mg high quality CBD for anywhere near the price we sell it.
[02:19:35.556 --> 02:19:37.938]  You're not going to find it at the 10 mg or the 20 mg.
[02:19:37.938 --> 02:19:41.702]  You're not going to find turmeric at 95% humanoid at the price we're selling it.
[02:19:41.702 --> 02:19:44.364]  You're not going to find any of this anywhere near that.
[02:19:44.364 --> 02:19:50.469]  These similar formulas or the same formulas sell for up to 200% more than we're selling these.
[02:19:50.469 --> 02:19:54.853]  InfoWars MD, now available exclusively at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:19:54.853 --> 02:19:55.553]  A true 360 win.
[02:19:59.870 --> 02:20:03.955]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[02:20:03.955 --> 02:20:05.778]  It's Alex Jones!
[02:20:22.263 --> 02:20:27.705]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[02:20:27.705 --> 02:20:34.207]  We're going to cover some of what Dave Scarlett saw on the board, but he's going to be on during the first hour of the War Room today, 3 p.m.
[02:20:34.207 --> 02:20:35.608]  Central Standard Time.
[02:20:36.508 --> 02:20:39.129]  Pastor, continuing, preach for us, because I'll interrupt a lot.
[02:20:39.129 --> 02:20:42.411]  I mean, just, and what you saw at the border, just everything that's happening.
[02:20:42.411 --> 02:20:44.012]  Congress, your view on the world right now.
[02:20:44.012 --> 02:20:46.153]  Yeah, we're at a tipping point.
[02:20:46.153 --> 02:20:50.596]  As General Flynn has many times said, our feet are over the edge as a nation.
[02:20:50.596 --> 02:20:54.178]  The whole world is looking to the United States of America for help.
[02:20:54.178 --> 02:20:57.660]  But our help doesn't come from a pope or a pastor or a prophet.
[02:20:57.660 --> 02:20:59.881]  It comes from the living Christ and our Lord and Savior.
[02:21:00.701 --> 02:21:01.502]  And that's what we need to do.
[02:21:01.502 --> 02:21:04.963]  We've got to get on our knees because this is a moment in time.
[02:21:04.963 --> 02:21:12.066]  I was down at the border, the Texas border, and I was just with Sheriff Lamb and Sheriff Daniels in Arizona.
[02:21:12.066 --> 02:21:15.108]  So I saw firsthand what we're doing, what they're doing.
[02:21:15.108 --> 02:21:18.670]  I saw one of your segments earlier about the fentanyl, how it's killing people.
[02:21:18.670 --> 02:21:21.971]  The terrorists coming across, that's what they call getaways.
[02:21:21.971 --> 02:21:24.932]  Eight out of ten people are getaways.
[02:21:24.932 --> 02:21:27.874]  They're parts of... A country is not a country that doesn't have a border.
[02:21:28.394 --> 02:21:29.755]  No border.
[02:21:29.755 --> 02:21:32.757]  I asked the question to people coming that were on the other side of the border.
[02:21:32.757 --> 02:21:35.900]  There's like 500 coming in in one hour in Arizona.
[02:21:35.900 --> 02:21:38.762]  I said, would you have come here under President Trump?
[02:21:38.762 --> 02:21:39.903]  And they said, absolutely not.
[02:21:39.903 --> 02:21:41.624]  I said, why are you coming, Joe Biden?
[02:21:41.624 --> 02:21:43.145]  Because he's told us open borders.
[02:21:43.145 --> 02:21:44.146]  He told him come.
[02:21:44.146 --> 02:21:45.567]  He immediately surged the border.
[02:21:46.227 --> 02:21:47.067]  And they did.
[02:21:47.067 --> 02:21:47.448]  And they did.
[02:21:47.448 --> 02:21:49.908]  And this is dangerous journalism you're doing.
[02:21:49.908 --> 02:21:50.969]  I've been down there a bunch too.
[02:21:50.969 --> 02:21:51.929]  It's dangerous.
[02:21:51.929 --> 02:21:54.630]  Oh yeah, we were scouted out by the cartel.
[02:21:54.630 --> 02:22:04.534]  They know exactly who we are and they threatened us many, many times and had to wear bulletproof vests when we go down there and got a chance to ride with the sheriffs and see exactly what they have to show.
[02:22:04.534 --> 02:22:08.035]  So you're doing more dangerous stuff as a pastor than you do as a Marine?
[02:22:08.035 --> 02:22:14.458]  Yeah, I have had three attempts on my life as a pastor and I've never had an attempt on my life as a Marine.
[02:22:15.390 --> 02:22:17.352]  Well, continue, Pastor.
[02:22:17.352 --> 02:22:17.933]  We're in a war.
[02:22:17.933 --> 02:22:20.896]  It's a spiritual war, but it's also a physical war.
[02:22:20.896 --> 02:22:24.299]  It's the largest PSYOP war we've ever seen.
[02:22:24.299 --> 02:22:27.543]  Fifth generation, as General Flynn likes to refer to it.
[02:22:27.543 --> 02:22:30.166]  And we have to be all in, or there's going to be no nation left.
[02:22:30.966 --> 02:22:34.269]  But the exciting thing is that God is not done with this Eagle Nation.
[02:22:34.269 --> 02:22:38.792]  As long as we, the remnant, are going to stand up and take action, glorious things are going to happen.
[02:22:38.792 --> 02:22:39.713]  We talk about tent revival.
[02:22:39.713 --> 02:22:41.414]  We're going to start doing tent revivals.
[02:22:41.414 --> 02:22:42.055]  We've already started.
[02:22:42.055 --> 02:22:44.677]  They're going to be in every single state, all 50 states.
[02:22:44.677 --> 02:22:45.978]  And then we're going to take it to the world.
[02:22:45.978 --> 02:22:47.018]  And you're starting in East Texas.
[02:22:47.018 --> 02:22:47.779]  That's a great place.
[02:22:47.779 --> 02:22:50.141]  Yeah, our new location in Texas.
[02:22:50.141 --> 02:22:51.342]  There's nothing like Texas.
[02:22:51.342 --> 02:22:52.022]  I love to be in Texas.
[02:22:52.022 --> 02:22:53.643]  What made you come to Texas?
[02:22:53.643 --> 02:22:54.044]  The people.
[02:22:54.804 --> 02:23:00.489]  Texas, you know, you see the world coming, you know, I asked one of the sheriffs when I was in Arizona, I said, are we in a civil war?
[02:23:00.489 --> 02:23:03.031]  Are we going to go to a civil war, was my question.
[02:23:03.031 --> 02:23:05.733]  He said, we're already in a civil war.
[02:23:05.733 --> 02:23:07.354]  It's just civil right now.
[02:23:07.354 --> 02:23:08.655]  Well, that's why they're attacking our police.
[02:23:08.655 --> 02:23:10.116]  The police in our department, they got a hard job.
[02:23:10.116 --> 02:23:13.059]  There's some bad ones, but statistically, they're so dedicated.
[02:23:13.059 --> 02:23:14.680]  They're so hardworking.
[02:23:14.680 --> 02:23:16.221]  And that's why they put in all these Soros DAs.
[02:23:17.322 --> 02:23:19.783]  Uh, to persecute and prosecute them when they do their job.
[02:23:19.783 --> 02:23:22.084]  It's, we gotta really stand with our police.
[02:23:22.084 --> 02:23:22.985]  We do, we do.
[02:23:22.985 --> 02:23:31.289]  I walked, I was with them for four or five days, riding with them, see what they have to go through every day, see the threats of the cartel, see the dangers of fentanyl.
[02:23:31.289 --> 02:23:33.470]  Oh, law enforcement on the border is most heroic.
[02:23:33.470 --> 02:23:34.271]  It's hellish.
[02:23:34.271 --> 02:23:35.511]  It is.
[02:23:35.511 --> 02:23:39.633]  Rifles pointed at them, you know, red scopes pointed at them, they know who they are.
[02:23:39.633 --> 02:23:42.335]  Well, they get killed all the time and it's not even a blip in the news.
[02:23:42.335 --> 02:23:42.735]  Not a blip.
[02:23:43.919 --> 02:23:48.880]  But they keep doing it, because they love what they're doing, and they love this country.
[02:23:48.880 --> 02:23:51.301]  We don't have enough of them, and we don't support them enough.
[02:23:51.301 --> 02:23:53.742]  And I know they thank independent journalists when we go down there.
[02:23:53.742 --> 02:23:54.062]  They do.
[02:23:54.062 --> 02:23:56.582]  We met with the Border Patrol a year ago, and they told us the same number.
[02:23:56.582 --> 02:23:59.203]  They said, look, it's 10 million coming in a year under Biden.
[02:23:59.203 --> 02:24:00.284]  This was last year.
[02:24:00.284 --> 02:24:02.144]  They said 8 out of 10 get away.
[02:24:02.144 --> 02:24:03.764]  We don't even catch them.
[02:24:03.764 --> 02:24:04.945]  And those are the bad ones.
[02:24:04.945 --> 02:24:07.846]  And the ones they catch, they're ordered to release.
[02:24:07.846 --> 02:24:08.826]  Yeah, you can't make it up.
[02:24:09.693 --> 02:24:10.934]  What else did you witness on the border?
[02:24:10.934 --> 02:24:12.636]  And how do people go watch these amazing videos?
[02:24:12.636 --> 02:24:19.142]  We're showing some of our TV viewers and for radio listeners who aren't seeing this, how do people go watch the incredible footage you gave us?
[02:24:19.142 --> 02:24:21.104]  This is some of the most incredible footage I've seen.
[02:24:21.104 --> 02:24:22.285]  Yeah, we have more coming.
[02:24:22.285 --> 02:24:26.690]  There's going to be a documentary that comes out to HisGlory.tv in March time frame.
[02:24:26.690 --> 02:24:28.912]  Some of it is already out on HisGlory.tv.
[02:24:28.912 --> 02:24:33.156]  Tell us about, you've already made documentaries, tell us about the past documentaries and the new one in production.
[02:24:33.416 --> 02:24:38.698]  We have the Texas border that we did, a Texas trip to the border.
[02:24:38.698 --> 02:24:40.839]  We have the Arizona border trip that will be coming out.
[02:24:40.839 --> 02:24:44.821]  We did a documentary with Mickey Willis with Israel.
[02:24:44.821 --> 02:24:47.041]  We went to Israel for 10 days with him.
[02:24:47.041 --> 02:24:48.182]  That's coming out.
[02:24:48.182 --> 02:24:49.442]  Capital Punishment, we helped.
[02:24:49.442 --> 02:24:55.265]  We got a lot of pushback for getting the movie January 6th, Capital Punishment with Nick Cerci and Chris Burgard.
[02:24:55.265 --> 02:24:57.025]  You can get that at HisGlory.tv.
[02:24:57.025 --> 02:24:58.466]  Probably the most censored movie ever.
[02:24:58.926 --> 02:25:01.668]  Because they lied to us about January 6th, and the truth is coming out?
[02:25:01.668 --> 02:25:02.769]  They're suppressing the 14th.
[02:25:02.769 --> 02:25:11.194]  Did you see Ray Epps confess to the committee, and they held it for almost a year, that he helped, quote, orchestrate the break-in?
[02:25:11.194 --> 02:25:11.995]  Yep.
[02:25:11.995 --> 02:25:13.516]  He said, I orchestrated it.
[02:25:13.516 --> 02:25:13.856]  He did.
[02:25:13.856 --> 02:25:15.697]  His own words.
[02:25:15.697 --> 02:25:17.638]  And they said, that's okay.
[02:25:17.638 --> 02:25:21.421]  But our own Owen Schroeder didn't go in, was with me, tried to keep people out.
[02:25:21.421 --> 02:25:23.582]  He was indicted, facing a year in jail right now.
[02:25:23.582 --> 02:25:26.124]  What they're doing... You're on his show now, over an hour.
[02:25:26.124 --> 02:25:26.284]  Yeah.
[02:25:27.188 --> 02:25:28.868]  This is the United States of America.
[02:25:28.868 --> 02:25:30.789]  You wouldn't think this would happen in the United States of America.
[02:25:30.789 --> 02:25:32.089]  Well, it's clown world!
[02:25:32.089 --> 02:25:33.309]  It is.
[02:25:33.309 --> 02:25:38.230]  Did you see how the University of Southern California banned the word field?
[02:25:38.230 --> 02:25:40.050]  Oh, because blacks were slaves in fields.
[02:25:40.050 --> 02:25:41.791]  Well, blacks were slaves on ships.
[02:25:41.791 --> 02:25:43.131]  Do we ban ships?
[02:25:43.131 --> 02:25:44.631]  I mean, what is that about?
[02:25:44.631 --> 02:25:46.752]  Well, it's even going into our military.
[02:25:46.752 --> 02:25:47.712]  You know, I'm a Marine.
[02:25:47.712 --> 02:25:51.613]  And now they want to use pronouns in the Marines.
[02:25:51.613 --> 02:25:52.193]  Well, gee...
[02:25:54.016 --> 02:26:01.000]  No, his are, no, boy and girl, it's just, you know, I deal with a lot of former generals.
[02:26:01.000 --> 02:26:05.843]  They're just, they're up in arms about what's happening to our military, and we need to fight back.
[02:26:05.843 --> 02:26:07.324]  It's the purposeful destruction of them.
[02:26:07.324 --> 02:26:08.945]  It is the purposeful.
[02:26:08.945 --> 02:26:10.646]  And that's exactly what General Boykin said.
[02:26:10.646 --> 02:26:13.048]  I asked him the question, how did this happen?
[02:26:13.048 --> 02:26:14.669]  He said it was Obama.
[02:26:14.669 --> 02:26:20.833]  Obama getting rid of all the right generals and putting in his... Well, they admit, this is the third administration of Obama.
[02:26:20.833 --> 02:26:21.213]  Exactly.
[02:26:22.728 --> 02:26:29.310]  General McInerney says that all the time, because of O'Biden, because it's being run by Obama.
[02:26:29.310 --> 02:26:37.453]  I think we're winning peacefully, and I don't want to call for violence because it'll be spun, it'll be directed wrong, but our founders finally at a point did fight back.
[02:26:37.453 --> 02:26:46.036]  Is there any point where, not at this point, we're not calling for it, but if there's enough attacks, enough things like 1776, at what point do we defend ourselves?
[02:26:46.036 --> 02:26:48.117]  When they're taking us to FEMA camps, forcibly injecting us?
[02:26:48.917 --> 02:26:50.937]  Yeah, well, there's going to have to be a point.
[02:26:50.937 --> 02:26:51.658]  You mentioned it.
[02:26:51.658 --> 02:26:53.958]  You know, our forefathers had a fight.
[02:26:53.958 --> 02:26:56.879]  The Black Royal Brudgeman had a Bible in one hand, a musket in the other.
[02:26:56.879 --> 02:26:58.399]  And they were Christians.
[02:26:58.399 --> 02:27:02.200]  In the whole Old Testament, much anew, Christ said, sell your cloak by a sword.
[02:27:02.200 --> 02:27:04.060]  That was the time for sacrifice.
[02:27:04.060 --> 02:27:05.681]  That was the time for him to do what he did.
[02:27:05.681 --> 02:27:08.441]  But I'm not calling for violence, folks.
[02:27:08.441 --> 02:27:09.361]  We're not directing it.
[02:27:09.361 --> 02:27:11.582]  It would help the enemy at this point.
[02:27:11.582 --> 02:27:13.262]  But they're taking us to FEMA camps.
[02:27:13.262 --> 02:27:14.843]  They're forcibly injecting us.
[02:27:14.843 --> 02:27:16.423]  They're making us take to market the beast.
[02:27:18.058 --> 02:27:21.519]  Do Christians in the Tribulation physically fight back?
[02:27:21.519 --> 02:27:22.439]  Yes, they will.
[02:27:22.439 --> 02:27:23.140]  They will.
[02:27:23.140 --> 02:27:30.182]  I was in Israel two months ago, and one of the most high-ranking Israeli generals gave me a gift.
[02:27:30.182 --> 02:27:36.764]  And in that gift was a book with all the six million Jewish people that were killed in the Holocaust, because nobody stood up.
[02:27:37.324 --> 02:27:38.324]  I thought it wasn't going to happen.
[02:27:38.324 --> 02:27:40.265]  Somebody else is going to take care of the problem.
[02:27:40.265 --> 02:27:43.707]  Well, there's only one person who's going to take care of the problem.
[02:27:43.707 --> 02:27:44.947]  That's our Lord and Savior.
[02:27:44.947 --> 02:27:48.669]  But he wants us to get off the fence and take action for his namesake.
[02:27:48.669 --> 02:27:52.071]  So we better work hard peacefully now so we don't have to do it physically.
[02:27:52.071 --> 02:27:52.691]  Exactly right.
[02:27:53.652 --> 02:27:55.433]  I know God, everything's preordained.
[02:27:55.433 --> 02:27:57.394]  God gives us free will, but God knows the outcome.
[02:27:57.394 --> 02:28:00.476]  You know, that's that whole paradox, but you see it.
[02:28:00.476 --> 02:28:02.217]  But is it almost like choose your adventure?
[02:28:02.217 --> 02:28:03.518]  God has a plan.
[02:28:03.518 --> 02:28:04.999]  We follow God's plan, everything's great.
[02:28:04.999 --> 02:28:08.581]  We don't, we become enslaved, and there's different deviations of that.
[02:28:09.904 --> 02:28:12.186]  God works through us with free will, doesn't God?
[02:28:12.186 --> 02:28:12.586]  He does.
[02:28:12.586 --> 02:28:12.926]  He does.
[02:28:12.926 --> 02:28:18.751]  So we're kind of choosing what version of Armageddon we get.
[02:28:18.751 --> 02:28:19.491]  That's right.
[02:28:19.491 --> 02:28:20.912]  Explain that to me.
[02:28:20.912 --> 02:28:22.293]  So, you know, there's a choice.
[02:28:22.293 --> 02:28:23.334]  God gives us free will.
[02:28:23.334 --> 02:28:25.356]  He wants us to choose us in the precept.
[02:28:25.896 --> 02:28:26.597]  Is his word.
[02:28:26.597 --> 02:28:29.859]  If you follow his word, things will never go perfect for you.
[02:28:29.859 --> 02:28:31.701]  You'll be attacked, but he's there with you.
[02:28:31.701 --> 02:28:32.541]  You've got that shalom.
[02:28:32.541 --> 02:28:33.662]  You've got that peace.
[02:28:33.662 --> 02:28:37.165]  But when you go off his word, there's repercussions of that word.
[02:28:37.165 --> 02:28:38.346]  Getting away from his word.
[02:28:38.346 --> 02:28:40.247]  The indifference is where the problem's at.
[02:28:40.247 --> 02:28:41.889]  Paul, this is the most important question.
[02:28:41.889 --> 02:28:42.529]  Stay there, Pastor.
[02:28:42.529 --> 02:28:45.171]  We're going to come back, because this is what it's all about.
[02:28:45.171 --> 02:28:48.774]  That peace, that quiet place, the Most High King David talked about.
[02:28:48.774 --> 02:28:49.755]  How do we reach that?
[02:28:49.755 --> 02:28:51.156]  Because I reach that only every once in a while.
[02:28:51.156 --> 02:28:53.418]  I have the most powerful thoughts when I can get there.
[02:28:53.418 --> 02:28:54.619]  How do we get there all the time?
[02:28:54.619 --> 02:28:54.919]  Stay there.
[02:28:58.607 --> 02:29:00.428]  InfoWars is winning.
[02:29:00.428 --> 02:29:02.468]  InfoWars is reaching more people than ever.
[02:29:02.468 --> 02:29:05.269]  We were supposed to be off the air months and months and months ago.
[02:29:05.269 --> 02:29:08.010]  Mainstream media told you, but it's not true.
[02:29:08.010 --> 02:29:10.111]  They told you we were going to be shut down.
[02:29:10.111 --> 02:29:12.172]  They told you we owed a billion and a half dollars.
[02:29:12.172 --> 02:29:13.132]  None of that's true.
[02:29:13.132 --> 02:29:14.513]  It's all being appealed.
[02:29:14.513 --> 02:29:16.614]  They want you to think InfoWars is dead.
[02:29:16.614 --> 02:29:23.056]  But if you simply stand up and support InfoWars, we've got years and years of appeals, and we will not be taken off the air.
[02:29:23.476 --> 02:29:26.920]  But if they can convince you that we've been shut down, they're going to win.
[02:29:26.920 --> 02:29:29.623]  Don't let the globalists psyop you and your family.
[02:29:29.623 --> 02:29:39.515]  Go to InfoWarsTore.com and get incredible products, supplements, books, films, t-shirts, you name it, that fund the InfoWar and empower your life and let the globalists know their psyop has not worked.
[02:29:39.975 --> 02:29:41.336]  Thanks for keeping us on the air.
[02:29:41.336 --> 02:29:49.839]  Take action at InfoWarsTore.com today, because the only people who can take us off the air is you, the viewers and listeners.
[02:29:49.839 --> 02:29:53.220]  The majority of you have not been silenced, but some of you have.
[02:29:53.220 --> 02:29:54.981]  Do not let the gloveless brainwash you.
[02:29:54.981 --> 02:29:56.902]  Go to InfoWarsTore.com to keep us on the air.
[02:30:00.009 --> 02:30:04.471]  Cobra Commander here with an important message to humanity.
[02:30:04.471 --> 02:30:12.694]  I have decided that all of you will take a special injection so that you will be safe.
[02:30:12.694 --> 02:30:16.235]  But the injection is not ready yet.
[02:30:16.235 --> 02:30:24.619]  And so, I need all of you to stay indoors for the next 15 days to flatten the curve.
[02:30:25.599 --> 02:30:32.644]  I also need you to wear masks, and I also need you to only shop at Mega Corporation.
[02:30:33.490 --> 02:30:43.894]  That way we can consolidate control and bankrupt the world economy, leaving companies that only I own profitable.
[02:30:43.894 --> 02:30:46.655]  You will then be my slaves.
[02:30:46.655 --> 02:30:51.317]  Oh, and then you'll get that special shot of venom from Cobra.
[02:30:51.317 --> 02:30:57.379]  It will remove your immune system, so you'll be dependent on me for the rest of your miserable lives.
[02:30:58.353 --> 02:30:59.995]  You want to beat the New World Order?
[02:30:59.995 --> 02:31:01.837]  You want to stop their globalist agenda?
[02:31:01.837 --> 02:31:09.926]  Well, so do I. And I've been the most effective individual in the fight against the globalists, and I've got their number, and I know how to bring them down.
[02:31:09.926 --> 02:31:14.070]  But ladies and gentlemen, I can't do it without your support.
[02:31:14.070 --> 02:31:16.753]  And the good news is, we're only under about $200,000 a month.
[02:31:18.615 --> 02:31:23.277]  The bad news is the enemy is intensifying their attacks on every front, but I'm not going to back down.
[02:31:23.277 --> 02:31:25.298]  And I'll never give up, but I could give out.
[02:31:25.298 --> 02:31:27.119]  So please, keep me on the field.
[02:31:27.119 --> 02:31:32.322]  Keep me on the front lines against the enemy, while getting great products at the same time that will empower you and your family.
[02:31:32.322 --> 02:31:43.508]  InfoWarsStore.com with the best supplements and more, or just make a straight donation, big red banner at the top of InfoWarsStore.com, and that way all the money goes towards the fight, not part of it going towards product cost.
[02:31:43.988 --> 02:31:45.269]  Thank you all for your support.
[02:31:45.269 --> 02:31:49.711]  Please commit now to go to m4wrestore.com to get great products and make donations.
[02:31:49.711 --> 02:31:50.672]  I thank you for your support.
[02:31:50.672 --> 02:31:51.872]  Now take action!
[02:31:51.872 --> 02:31:54.614]  The globalists are counting on you not taking action!
[02:31:58.550 --> 02:32:00.792]  It's a post-COVID world now.
[02:32:00.792 --> 02:32:04.815]  Americans have lost trust in their doctors and the health care system.
[02:32:04.815 --> 02:32:06.136]  There's a solution.
[02:32:06.136 --> 02:32:07.116]  The Wellness Company.
[02:32:07.116 --> 02:32:10.419]  I'm Dr. Peter McCullough, and I'm the Chief Scientific Officer.
[02:32:10.419 --> 02:32:17.624]  And I can tell you firsthand that these verticals of uncensored content, virtual appointments, doctors on demand,
[02:32:17.884 --> 02:32:43.962]  Prescriptions through a network of community pharmacies, in-home, in vitro diagnostics, laboratory testing, imaging, an online set of holistic products can help guide you for your usual general medical care, but also COVID-19, acute and post-COVID syndromes, vaccine injury syndromes, and the array of things that now America has to work through in this new
[02:32:45.041 --> 02:32:45.541]  I think so.
[02:33:19.560 --> 02:33:24.364]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[02:33:24.364 --> 02:33:26.066]  You want to stop tyranny?
[02:33:26.066 --> 02:33:27.747]  Well, so does he.
[02:33:27.747 --> 02:33:32.932]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:32.932 --> 02:33:34.153]  Pastor Dave Scarlett's here.
[02:33:34.153 --> 02:33:38.156]  He'll be on in the first hour of the War Room today with the great Owen Schroyer.
[02:33:38.156 --> 02:33:45.123]  Pastor, we're getting to a key point about King David talking about that quiet place of the most time.
[02:33:46.497 --> 02:33:58.123]  Or that third heaven, because we've got Earth, we've got the heavens, and the third heaven's an interdimensional universe of God that so many people have never even experienced.
[02:33:58.123 --> 02:33:59.404]  I've only experienced it a few times.
[02:33:59.404 --> 02:34:02.386]  It's total commitment, total completion.
[02:34:02.386 --> 02:34:10.530]  You're with God beyond just the Holy Spirit convicting you, but you're interfacing with God and just there's a total peace or shalom you talked about.
[02:34:10.530 --> 02:34:11.271]  How do we
[02:34:12.954 --> 02:34:15.996]  How do I, how do we spend more time in that place?
[02:34:15.996 --> 02:34:18.058]  The Shalom is the Hebrew word for peace.
[02:34:18.058 --> 02:34:21.040]  That is that total peace that can only come from God.
[02:34:21.040 --> 02:34:24.563]  And the way you do that is you gotta immerse yourself in the word.
[02:34:24.563 --> 02:34:27.805]  And once we're in the word, meditate on his word.
[02:34:27.805 --> 02:34:29.286]  Listen for his still voice.
[02:34:29.286 --> 02:34:34.870]  We just get in, sometimes we get in the word, sometimes we meditate, but we don't listen for him to talk back to us.
[02:34:34.870 --> 02:34:35.991]  We're off too fast.
[02:34:36.491 --> 02:34:41.218]  We get into that meditation, and we're just in tune to the Spirit of the Lord.
[02:34:41.218 --> 02:34:47.106]  He will touch us, and you get those moments in time, like I just felt right now, where His Spirit is here.
[02:34:47.106 --> 02:34:47.507]  He's with you.
[02:34:47.507 --> 02:34:48.188]  You feel it right now?
[02:34:48.188 --> 02:34:48.708]  I feel it right now.
[02:34:49.704 --> 02:34:50.345]  Can you feel it?
[02:34:50.345 --> 02:34:50.945]  I can feel it.
[02:34:50.945 --> 02:34:51.546]  Yep.
[02:34:51.546 --> 02:34:52.426]  He's here.
[02:34:52.426 --> 02:34:54.168]  And why does the enemy hate that so much?
[02:34:54.168 --> 02:34:55.269]  Why do they hate the name of Jesus?
[02:34:55.269 --> 02:34:57.531]  Because it's the power of Almighty God.
[02:34:57.531 --> 02:34:59.092]  That's why we want to have the comforter.
[02:34:59.092 --> 02:35:00.033]  And we're transceivers.
[02:35:00.033 --> 02:35:01.054]  We're bringing that in.
[02:35:01.054 --> 02:35:01.614]  It's free will.
[02:35:01.614 --> 02:35:06.438]  Because Satan forces his energy, but God only comes knocking, but we've got to open the door.
[02:35:06.438 --> 02:35:07.479]  Got to open the door.
[02:35:07.479 --> 02:35:08.580]  He is the door.
[02:35:08.580 --> 02:35:11.743]  So how often are you able to get in the quiet place the most time?
[02:35:11.983 --> 02:35:12.263]  I don't
[02:35:31.624 --> 02:35:55.256]  I mean it's like every time I just start bawling and crying and just just feeling his presence and we talk about drugs and addiction there's no drug there's no drug what is that when the Holy Spirit floods you so strong you start crying my wife sometimes I'll just be sitting there start crying she goes what's going on I feel God I just it's like it's amazing there's no there's and the closer you get to the truth the more you're pushed into that it's like you're just like right now I feel it
[02:35:56.016 --> 02:35:59.199]  Yeah, can you imagine what Heaven's going to be like?
[02:35:59.199 --> 02:36:02.462]  When you can feel that Shekinah glory all the time?
[02:36:02.462 --> 02:36:03.423]  We get moments of that.
[02:36:03.423 --> 02:36:07.387]  And we can get that as much as we want if we get in tune to His Spirit.
[02:36:07.387 --> 02:36:08.869]  But we don't slow down and get it.
[02:36:08.869 --> 02:36:11.891]  So why does our body physiologically cry when we're in the presence of God?
[02:36:11.891 --> 02:36:14.874]  Because He sees the condition of our heart.
[02:36:15.876 --> 02:36:16.917]  Your heart is open.
[02:36:16.917 --> 02:36:19.378]  You know who he is and you love him.
[02:36:19.378 --> 02:36:20.599]  It's not about a religion.
[02:36:20.599 --> 02:36:22.520]  It's about a love relationship in the heart.
[02:36:22.520 --> 02:36:24.101]  And that's what you mentioned King David.
[02:36:24.101 --> 02:36:26.042]  That's why he's the apple of God's eye.
[02:36:26.042 --> 02:36:29.224]  Beloved is because he saw David's heart.
[02:36:29.224 --> 02:36:32.486]  And David's heart loved him.
[02:36:32.486 --> 02:36:35.588]  And then the opposite of that is Satan's black heart.
[02:36:35.588 --> 02:36:36.389]  Exactly.
[02:36:36.389 --> 02:36:37.269]  It's black and white.
[02:36:37.269 --> 02:36:39.951]  That's why you can't be indifferent and be on the fence.
[02:36:39.951 --> 02:36:43.133]  You're either all in or you're all out.
[02:36:43.133 --> 02:36:44.854]  Indifferent is not what we need.
[02:36:46.789 --> 02:36:47.590]  We have to be all in.
[02:37:05.294 --> 02:37:08.577]  Why would you not want eternal peace and total completion?
[02:37:08.577 --> 02:37:12.059]  I don't understand how you wouldn't want this right now.
[02:37:12.059 --> 02:37:12.760]  You feel it right now?
[02:37:12.760 --> 02:37:13.781]  I feel it, oh yeah.
[02:37:13.781 --> 02:37:14.721]  Why would you not want that?
[02:37:14.721 --> 02:37:15.782]  He's here!
[02:37:15.782 --> 02:37:16.503]  What's wrong with him?
[02:37:18.347 --> 02:37:20.208]  They've been channeled by Satan.
[02:37:20.208 --> 02:37:23.229]  Satan does not want man to have a relationship with God.
[02:37:23.229 --> 02:37:26.530]  Once he was thrown out of heaven, that's when the war started.
[02:37:26.530 --> 02:37:30.652]  And it's the media and the culture and things that trick us out of that level.
[02:37:30.652 --> 02:37:32.092]  And you feel yourself shift out of it.
[02:37:32.092 --> 02:37:34.833]  I catch it all the time, like literally being, I'll destroy that person.
[02:37:34.833 --> 02:37:36.074]  I'll end up having these evil thoughts.
[02:37:36.074 --> 02:37:38.735]  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[02:37:38.735 --> 02:37:40.996]  That's why we have to have a shalom in his peace.
[02:37:40.996 --> 02:37:43.997]  Through that peace, he wins, but we have to participate with him.
[02:37:44.841 --> 02:37:50.689]  And when you participate, there's no better joy in the world than riding the train with His glory.
[02:37:50.689 --> 02:37:53.733]  And the incredible thing is, it isn't just that feeling of completion and peace.
[02:37:53.733 --> 02:37:54.895]  You give a discernment.
[02:37:54.895 --> 02:37:55.916]  Now everything's clear.
[02:37:55.916 --> 02:37:56.938]  Absolutely.
[02:37:56.938 --> 02:37:58.921]  You supernaturally know things that you could never know.
[02:38:00.404 --> 02:38:01.325]  What's happening?
[02:38:01.325 --> 02:38:02.685]  I mean, we know we're electrochemical.
[02:38:02.685 --> 02:38:03.826]  We're receivers.
[02:38:03.826 --> 02:38:04.506]  Transceivers.
[02:38:04.506 --> 02:38:05.587]  We worship.
[02:38:05.587 --> 02:38:06.628]  That's transmitting.
[02:38:06.628 --> 02:38:07.748]  We receive.
[02:38:07.748 --> 02:38:08.589]  That's the Holy Spirit.
[02:38:08.589 --> 02:38:09.890]  What is that?
[02:38:09.890 --> 02:38:13.112]  That is His love shining down in us and through us.
[02:38:13.112 --> 02:38:16.114]  And the key word you just said, Alex, is worship.
[02:38:16.114 --> 02:38:22.717]  We do a lot of time praying to the Lord, but we don't worship Him and just stop and say, thank you, Lord, for everything you've given me.
[02:38:23.718 --> 02:38:26.319]  Explain why that's so important and why God wants that.
[02:38:26.319 --> 02:38:27.359]  That's opening the channel.
[02:38:27.359 --> 02:38:28.780]  It's opening the channel for Him.
[02:38:28.780 --> 02:38:32.481]  It's opening your heart to His heart and the worship just got flooded out.
[02:38:32.481 --> 02:38:36.362]  He's intense again right now just by talking about it.
[02:38:36.362 --> 02:38:37.202]  It's worship.
[02:38:37.202 --> 02:38:38.623]  Worship Him.
[02:38:38.623 --> 02:38:40.623]  Because God doesn't force free will.
[02:38:40.623 --> 02:38:43.324]  God's waiting, but only when the channel opens.
[02:38:43.324 --> 02:38:44.504]  Right, when we take action.
[02:38:44.504 --> 02:38:45.465]  We have to.
[02:38:45.465 --> 02:38:50.506]  And I found getting around real believers like you, that's why they don't want us in a church, that magnifies it.
[02:38:50.506 --> 02:38:50.806]  It does.
[02:38:50.806 --> 02:38:53.027]  Can you imagine if you get millions of people
[02:38:54.079 --> 02:38:57.801]  In this remnant, just like this, with the Spirit of the Lord going, nothing can stop us.
[02:38:57.801 --> 02:39:01.023]  That's why Satan is so afraid of the remnant.
[02:39:01.023 --> 02:39:13.510]  That's why the first thing they said is, the porn shops and liquor stores and Walmart's open and Target's open, but churches are closed, because that is just a... those real churches that are out there, it's so powerful.
[02:39:13.510 --> 02:39:14.551]  They know the power of the Lord.
[02:39:15.151 --> 02:39:16.672]  And that's the first thing they try to target.
[02:39:16.672 --> 02:39:17.693]  And what did the church do?
[02:39:17.693 --> 02:39:18.553]  Shut down.
[02:39:18.553 --> 02:39:19.794]  It's time for the church to rise.
[02:39:19.794 --> 02:39:20.835]  The true church.
[02:39:20.835 --> 02:39:21.876]  The Church of Christ.
[02:39:21.876 --> 02:39:29.481]  So what is a spiritual exercise for people that have never experienced the Holy Spirit?
[02:39:29.481 --> 02:39:34.884]  Lead us in prayer in the few minutes we have left, or a short sermon about it.
[02:39:34.884 --> 02:39:38.687]  How do people that have never experienced this next level, how do they open the channel to God?
[02:39:39.227 --> 02:39:46.152]  What you need to do is a lot of people think that there's this advanced formula because we've been taught in religion is this complex.
[02:39:46.152 --> 02:39:50.215]  I even heard one pastor say Christianity is a thinking man's religion.
[02:39:50.215 --> 02:39:51.996]  That's the furthest thing from the truth.
[02:39:51.996 --> 02:39:54.638]  It's a love relationship and you talk to him like a loving father.
[02:39:54.838 --> 02:39:55.378]  A bride and groom.
[02:39:55.378 --> 02:39:56.139]  A bride and groom.
[02:39:56.139 --> 02:39:57.080]  You love him.
[02:39:57.080 --> 02:39:59.481]  And you don't need to have a fancy prayer to him.
[02:39:59.481 --> 02:40:00.382]  He knows your heart.
[02:40:00.382 --> 02:40:02.503]  He knows what you're going to ask before you ask it.
[02:40:02.503 --> 02:40:03.244]  But ask him.
[02:40:03.244 --> 02:40:06.106]  Just say, Lord, come down into me.
[02:40:06.106 --> 02:40:07.707]  Show me your kingdom glory.
[02:40:07.707 --> 02:40:09.468]  Walk in my ways.
[02:40:09.468 --> 02:40:10.389]  Show me the path.
[02:40:10.389 --> 02:40:12.070]  Give me wisdom and discernment.
[02:40:12.070 --> 02:40:14.352]  And then just listen and meditate on him.
[02:40:14.352 --> 02:40:16.513]  And let him talk back to you.
[02:40:16.513 --> 02:40:17.554]  And you feel the Spirit of the Lord.
[02:40:17.554 --> 02:40:19.115]  And you've got to keep exercising it.
[02:40:19.115 --> 02:40:20.196]  It's like a muscle.
[02:40:20.196 --> 02:40:23.939]  The more we get into that with him, the more he gets into us.
[02:40:24.679 --> 02:40:26.081]  And it grows, and grows, and grows.
[02:40:26.081 --> 02:40:29.146]  And when you have it, you don't want to quit.
[02:40:29.146 --> 02:40:31.489]  And that gives us the perseverance, too.
[02:40:31.489 --> 02:40:35.876]  When we're in a battle, we're not going to quit, because we know he's already won.
[02:40:35.876 --> 02:40:37.518]  Well, I'm under a lot of stress, enemy attack.
[02:40:37.518 --> 02:40:39.220]  I've learned to turn loose and say, God, I can't do it.
[02:40:39.220 --> 02:40:39.942]  I need you to help me.
[02:40:41.090 --> 02:40:42.772]  It's like instant.
[02:40:42.772 --> 02:40:44.294]  And all these answers come.
[02:40:44.294 --> 02:40:47.717]  It's like you're jacking into eternity, into God.
[02:40:47.717 --> 02:40:48.298]  Yep.
[02:40:48.298 --> 02:40:49.539]  You hit the nail on the head.
[02:40:49.539 --> 02:40:53.703]  You said, I. We as individuals can't do it, but He can.
[02:40:53.703 --> 02:40:56.226]  And we need to ask Him to come in and direct our paths.
[02:40:56.226 --> 02:40:59.590]  And as soon as we do that, supernaturally, He's going to open up ways that we can.
[02:40:59.590 --> 02:41:00.390]  We've got a minute and a half left.
[02:41:00.390 --> 02:41:01.952]  We'll be on the first hour of the war.
[02:41:01.952 --> 02:41:03.273]  And lead us in a one-minute prayer about
[02:41:04.775 --> 02:41:07.257]  My dad always said, prayers that are held by God, please.
[02:41:07.257 --> 02:41:08.518]  We know we're failed and flawed.
[02:41:08.518 --> 02:41:09.499]  We love you as your son.
[02:41:09.499 --> 02:41:10.840]  Lead God and direct us.
[02:41:10.840 --> 02:41:11.501]  Come into us.
[02:41:11.501 --> 02:41:12.562]  What would you say to people?
[02:41:12.562 --> 02:41:17.426]  I'd say to anybody out there that hasn't accepted the Lord and their Savior, Jesus Christ, or think they have.
[02:41:17.426 --> 02:41:22.650]  There are many people in our church today that think they're saved, but they're not, because you don't have that personal relationship with them.
[02:41:22.650 --> 02:41:25.633]  You just have some very simple, Lord Jesus Christ, come into my heart.
[02:41:25.993 --> 02:41:26.573]  I'm a sinner.
[02:41:26.573 --> 02:41:29.994]  I've fallen short of the glory of God, and I can't do it on my own.
[02:41:29.994 --> 02:41:30.834]  I need you.
[02:41:30.834 --> 02:41:32.034]  I need you in me.
[02:41:32.034 --> 02:41:33.214]  I need you to guide me.
[02:41:33.214 --> 02:41:36.975]  I need you to give me the blueprint, because your word is the blueprint.
[02:41:36.975 --> 02:41:41.416]  Help me keep that shalom and that peace and that focus on you and not the world.
[02:41:41.416 --> 02:41:44.717]  Don't let Satan make me go to the left or go to the right.
[02:41:44.717 --> 02:41:46.297]  I stay straight on you.
[02:41:46.297 --> 02:41:51.818]  And we ask anybody that's prayed that in Jesus' name, if you haven't accepted the Lord Jesus Christ as your Lord and Savior, now's the time.
[02:41:52.378 --> 02:41:55.499]  Satan's favorite day of the week is tomorrow because tomorrow is never given.
[02:41:55.499 --> 02:41:56.819]  Jesus, come into my heart.
[02:41:56.819 --> 02:41:57.400]  I'm a sinner.
[02:41:57.400 --> 02:42:02.641]  Forgive me of my sins and I want you to be the commander in chief in my life.
[02:42:02.641 --> 02:42:07.163]  If you prayed that and you meant that in your heart, you just entered into eternal life with him.
[02:42:07.163 --> 02:42:08.303]  Now the walk begins.
[02:42:08.303 --> 02:42:09.824]  Now you need to take action.
[02:42:09.824 --> 02:42:13.405]  Get in his word and ask the Holy Spirit to come down as the comforter in you.
[02:42:14.065 --> 02:42:21.690]  And I want listeners to know, who have not understood this and had a fake religion or corrupt priest or whatever, this is so real, folks.
[02:42:21.690 --> 02:42:22.910]  God's waiting.
[02:42:22.910 --> 02:42:24.131]  God knows the problems.
[02:42:24.131 --> 02:42:25.732]  But God's a free will God.
[02:42:25.732 --> 02:42:26.613]  He gave you free will.
[02:42:26.613 --> 02:42:28.174]  You've got to say, help me.
[02:42:28.174 --> 02:42:28.774]  I need you.
[02:42:28.774 --> 02:42:29.755]  I love you.
[02:42:29.755 --> 02:42:30.395]  Come into me.
[02:42:30.395 --> 02:42:30.795]  Show me.
[02:42:30.795 --> 02:42:31.716]  It's going to happen.
[02:42:31.716 --> 02:42:32.356]  It's going to happen.
[02:42:32.356 --> 02:42:33.517]  There's no doubt about it.
[02:42:33.517 --> 02:42:34.918]  He just wants our hand.
[02:42:35.618 --> 02:42:38.499]  Pastor, thank you so much.
[02:42:38.499 --> 02:42:39.180]  We love you.
[02:42:39.180 --> 02:42:41.221]  You're on The War Room, the first hour coming up.
[02:42:41.221 --> 02:42:42.421]  We've got special guests coming up.
[02:42:42.421 --> 02:42:44.922]  A big report and promo video is coming up.
[02:42:44.922 --> 02:42:46.223]  I'll be on Piers Morgan next hour.
[02:42:46.223 --> 02:42:47.984]  There should be fireworks from that.
[02:42:47.984 --> 02:42:49.844]  We'll be covering it tomorrow on the show as well.
[02:42:49.844 --> 02:42:50.545]  God bless you all.
[02:42:50.545 --> 02:42:52.086]  Pastor, thank you so much.
[02:42:52.086 --> 02:42:52.766]  Dave Scarlett.
[02:42:52.766 --> 02:42:54.887]  People should check it out at HisGloryTV.
[02:42:58.743 --> 02:43:17.921]  Everyone watching should realize that this is an information war and it takes money to fund an information war and everyone should decide to take the fight to the next level and to take the fight to the very tip of the spear and ensure we stay in the field in this war against the new world order by visiting infowarestore.com right now and taking action.
[02:43:17.921 --> 02:43:22.866]  I thank you for your past support and I ask you now to count the cost and realize that only your commitment
[02:43:23.286 --> 02:43:24.907]  Keep Info Wars on the air.
[02:43:24.907 --> 02:43:27.208]  We'll ensure our victory against the New World Order.
[02:43:27.208 --> 02:43:28.668]  They're coming for you and your family.
[02:43:28.668 --> 02:43:29.929]  They're coming for me.
[02:43:29.929 --> 02:43:31.149]  They're coming for the children.
[02:43:31.149 --> 02:43:33.730]  But to get to the children, they've got to get through us first.
[02:43:33.730 --> 02:43:37.111]  These monsters are all over television, wanting to give these shots to newborn babies.
[02:43:37.111 --> 02:43:38.412]  They're already giving them to pregnant women.
[02:43:38.652 --> 02:43:40.733]  Miscarriages are off the chart.
[02:43:40.733 --> 02:43:46.177]  80 plus percent increase in miscarriages in the first two trimesters after these poison shots.
[02:43:46.177 --> 02:43:50.099]  We can and will save the children and they are counting on us.
[02:43:50.099 --> 02:43:51.300]  Let's do it together.
[02:43:51.300 --> 02:43:53.601]  And the fight starts at InfoWars.com.
[02:43:53.601 --> 02:43:57.423]  And the fight continues with your financial support at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:43:57.423 --> 02:43:58.704]  Now take action now!
[02:43:58.704 --> 02:44:04.688]  I'm Dr. Peter McCullough and it's an absolute pleasure to introduce to you The Wellness Company.
[02:44:05.976 --> 02:44:16.359]  An alternative healthcare system for this COVID and post-COVID world where trust has been lost in doctors and healthcare systems.
[02:44:16.359 --> 02:44:31.884]  This new online virtual platform is nationwide providing uncensored content, virtual appointments, laboratory testing, diagnostics, prescriptions, treatment packages specifically
[02:44:32.464 --> 02:44:41.288]  For COVID, post-COVID, vaccine injury syndromes, and all the usual things that are seen in primary care.
[02:44:41.288 --> 02:44:49.471]  And then we have an entire array of holistic products, an online store, media, and health advice.
[02:44:49.471 --> 02:44:57.655]  Come see The Wellness Company and go to onlinehealthnow.com as a conduit to The Wellness Company.
[02:44:59.167 --> 02:45:06.349]  Ladies and gentlemen, InfoWars Live products have always been the highest quality, triple tested, and you've seen the right reviews.
[02:45:06.349 --> 02:45:17.373]  But doing deep research, we made contact with the top company in the United States, and it turned out they were supplying almost all the raw materials to the companies that we were already using.
[02:45:17.373 --> 02:45:25.936]  So we've gone directly to the source, and that means we can give you lower prices on the very same high quality supplements, and in some cases, even better.
[02:45:25.936 --> 02:45:26.496]  Introducing
[02:45:27.356 --> 02:45:31.922]  InfoWarsMD at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:45:31.922 --> 02:45:37.208]  InfoWarsMD exclusively at InfoWarsStore.com has 10 new products.
[02:45:37.208 --> 02:45:45.418]  Turmeric 95, Libido RX, Better Mood, Nitric Boost, Much Room Max, Anitropin, Angels Vitality Collagen,
[02:45:45.798 --> 02:45:47.880]  There is a war on for your mind.
[02:45:47.880 --> 02:45:48.961]  Your mind is a battlefield.
[02:45:48.961 --> 02:45:49.721]  This is an information war.
[02:46:04.813 --> 02:46:09.498]  InfoWars popularized those terms more than two decades ago.
[02:46:09.498 --> 02:46:18.707]  And today, whether it's Donald Trump, or Governor DeSantis, or Dr. Robert Malone, they're all using the terms that InfoWars has popularized.
[02:46:18.707 --> 02:46:21.950]  Because we understand the enemy's operations, and we know how to beat them.
[02:46:22.350 --> 02:46:29.614]  But we can't do it without funding, and we make it easy to fund with great products that empower you and your immune system, and your family as well.
[02:46:29.614 --> 02:46:33.536]  You can also make straight donations at mfulworthstore.com, clicking on the big red banner.
[02:46:33.536 --> 02:46:36.777]  A one-time, a recurring, but I'm asking you to take action.
[02:46:36.777 --> 02:46:37.578]  We're non-violent.
[02:46:38.018 --> 02:46:45.944]  But every time you donate money, every time you buy products, every time you keep us on air, you are literally, non-violently, politically, punching the New World Order in the nose.
[02:46:45.944 --> 02:46:48.286]  Punching their lies in the nose.
[02:46:48.286 --> 02:46:50.107]  We are going to defeat the New World Order.
[02:46:50.107 --> 02:46:51.228]  We're going over the top.
[02:46:51.228 --> 02:46:52.749]  But right now is the critical juncture.
[02:46:52.749 --> 02:46:55.892]  So please go to infowarestore.com and donate now!
[02:46:55.892 --> 02:46:56.452]  Donate now!
[02:46:56.452 --> 02:46:56.833]  Donate now!
[02:46:56.833 --> 02:46:57.393]  Donate now!
[02:46:57.393 --> 02:46:57.853]  Donate now!
[02:46:57.853 --> 02:47:00.075]  Donate now!
[02:47:00.075 --> 02:47:05.960]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[02:47:34.850 --> 02:47:39.454]  Out here in the dark, you can't tell where you are.
[02:47:39.454 --> 02:47:43.737]  You're not able to ascertain the terrain around you.
[02:47:43.737 --> 02:47:52.584]  But as you begin to add more light to the situation, the details come into focus and you begin to become aware of your surroundings.
[02:47:54.955 --> 02:48:14.462]  Light is commonly used as an archetype or a metaphor for the truth and with the surveillance of the censorship of intelligence agencies working with legacy media and big tech they have attempted to suppress the light in the last three years while they launched their great reset agenda but because of independent journalists and citizens and scientists and doctors
[02:48:14.462 --> 02:48:16.003]  It's coming out and blowing the whistle.
[02:48:16.003 --> 02:48:20.565]  The globalist attempt to suppress us and keep us in darkness has completely failed.
[02:48:20.565 --> 02:48:27.608]  And now that the full horror of what we've all gone through has started to come into crisp focus, we realize that we are all in grave danger.
[02:48:27.608 --> 02:48:31.250]  We're all standing on the edge of a cliff.
[02:48:33.865 --> 02:48:57.536]  If you begin to research even more, and as more light floods the zone, we realize that many of us have been pushed off that cliff to their deaths in many cases, and into debilitating illnesses, sterility, heart attacks, myocarditis, blood clots, and so many other terrible adversities that we now know the CDC was aware of before the poison shots were even rolled out.
[02:48:57.536 --> 02:48:58.117]  In October,
[02:48:59.478 --> 02:49:00.459]  Of 2000.
[02:49:00.459 --> 02:49:04.063]  Why would they admit in their own documents they were conscious of this program?
[02:49:04.063 --> 02:49:06.565]  There's a lot of reasons for that.
[02:49:06.565 --> 02:49:08.788]  We'll be discussing them in the days and weeks and months to come.
[02:49:09.727 --> 02:49:10.868]  But know this.
[02:49:10.868 --> 02:49:13.150]  A reckoning isn't coming.
[02:49:13.150 --> 02:49:14.611]  It's already here.
[02:49:14.611 --> 02:49:24.240]  And Klaus Schwab and Bill Gates and Fauci and the rest of his criminal eugenics depopulation cult, like Paul Ehrlich and others, must be brought to justice.
[02:49:24.240 --> 02:49:27.363]  Because they're already planning new attacks.
[02:49:27.363 --> 02:49:30.966]  They've already scripted the next bioweapon release.
[02:49:30.966 --> 02:49:33.889]  And they've already cast themselves as the heroes.
[02:49:35.962 --> 02:49:38.526]  At many levels, cities are amazing things.
[02:49:38.526 --> 02:49:41.590]  Art is the most incredible selection.
[02:49:41.590 --> 02:49:44.915]  Food and medicine and entertainment.
[02:49:44.915 --> 02:49:48.219]  And the globalists at the United Nations constantly brack.
[02:49:49.421 --> 02:50:06.776]  That the mega cities of the future, Austin being one of them, will be the control grids that take over all the countryside and rural areas and will be used to train people to live in a high-tech technocracy that makes the current communist Chinese social credit score look tame in comparison.
[02:50:06.776 --> 02:50:14.983]  That's why in this revolution we've got to not just have the information, we've not just got to keep our immune systems up, we've got to warn others about the new world order and
[02:50:15.863 --> 02:50:25.555]  All of us need to work with friends and family to get pieces of rural property and get back to the land, even if it's only part-time, to learn how to become self-sufficient.
[02:50:25.555 --> 02:50:30.520]  Because in the future, you're going to watch those under the control of the globalists and the social credit score.
[02:50:31.061 --> 02:50:44.011]  You're going to watch those who are caught in the trap of the universal basic income, being forced to take injections, being forced to be sterilized, being forced in many cases to even be part of government-sponsored euthanasia.
[02:50:44.011 --> 02:50:45.752]  Canada is the model.
[02:50:45.752 --> 02:50:47.053]  This is a control grid.
[02:50:47.053 --> 02:50:49.174]  This is a vice they're putting us in.
[02:50:49.174 --> 02:50:51.276]  Everybody should go online and find my film.
[02:50:51.496 --> 02:50:53.817]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[02:50:53.817 --> 02:50:55.657]  Once free nations are slaves to the will of a tiny elite.
[02:50:55.657 --> 02:50:56.998]  The dawn of a new dark age is upon mankind.
[02:51:21.989 --> 02:51:24.631]  Countries are a thing of the past.
[02:51:24.631 --> 02:51:33.119]  Every form of independence is under attack, with the family and even the individual itself nearing extinction.
[02:51:33.119 --> 02:51:38.664]  Close to 80% of the Earth's population has been eliminated.
[02:51:38.664 --> 02:51:45.570]  The remnants of a once free humanity are forced to live within highly controlled, compact, prison-like cities.
[02:51:47.305 --> 02:51:50.066]  Travel is highly restricted.
[02:51:50.066 --> 02:51:57.287]  Superhighways connect the megacities and keep the population from entering into unauthorized zones.
[02:51:57.287 --> 02:52:00.148]  No human activity is private.
[02:52:00.148 --> 02:52:04.649]  AI supercomputers chronicle and categorize every action.
[02:52:04.649 --> 02:52:11.730]  A prison planet dominated by a ruthless gang of control freaks, whose power can never be challenged.
[02:52:11.730 --> 02:52:14.011]  This is the vision of the global elite.
[02:52:14.011 --> 02:52:14.491]  Their goal.
[02:52:16.071 --> 02:52:20.377]  The bad news is these people mean business and are mass murdering mad scientists.
[02:52:20.377 --> 02:52:25.763]  The good news is we have their blueprint, we have the Death Star plans, and we know how to bring them down.
[02:52:25.763 --> 02:52:28.927]  That city is a UN-controlled stronghold.
[02:52:28.927 --> 02:52:31.771]  That is a test grid for the systems they're putting in.
[02:52:32.071 --> 02:52:40.320]  Not just the 5G, but the surveillance, the tracker chips of all the cars, the kill switches, the robots, the drones, all of it is being admitted.
[02:52:40.320 --> 02:52:44.424]  The globalists are taking control of the evolutionary process of humanity.
[02:52:44.424 --> 02:52:48.568]  They're playing God and treating us like Benjamin Netanyahu said a month ago.
[02:52:49.389 --> 02:52:53.531]  So Israel became, if you will, the lab for Pfizer, and that's how we did it.
[02:52:53.531 --> 02:52:59.694]  We gave the information to the world, not only it's been published in medical magazines and so on.
[02:52:59.694 --> 02:53:01.995]  I intend to bring on that base
[02:53:14.341 --> 02:53:15.502]  We're good to go.
[02:53:40.103 --> 02:53:41.204]  Think about that.
[02:53:41.204 --> 02:53:42.525]  That's what Israel's become.
[02:53:42.525 --> 02:53:43.846]  That's what Singapore's become.
[02:53:43.846 --> 02:53:45.087]  That's what the UK's become.
[02:53:45.087 --> 02:53:46.228]  That's what Germany's become.
[02:53:46.228 --> 02:53:49.850]  That's what China is the model of, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:53:49.850 --> 02:53:56.015]  And we have to come together and realize this, and not let them continue to push humanity over the edge of the cliff.
[02:53:56.015 --> 02:53:58.757]  InfoWars is the very front line of this fight.
[02:53:58.757 --> 02:53:59.658]  The very tip of the spear.
[02:53:59.658 --> 02:54:01.419]  And I salute the thinking of your past support.
[02:54:01.419 --> 02:54:04.942]  But now more than ever realize, we need your support and your word of mouth.
[02:54:05.402 --> 02:54:07.224]  The public is ready to hear the truth.
[02:54:07.224 --> 02:54:09.947]  We've won major battles, but the war has not been won yet.
[02:54:09.947 --> 02:54:19.956]  Please spread the word about the broadcast and go to InfoWarsTore.com and buy great products today that boost your immune system and empower your life while also keeping InfoWars on the air a true 360 win.
[02:54:19.956 --> 02:54:21.318]  Like a rock thrown into a pond.
[02:54:22.078 --> 02:54:27.341]  Your actions, even though they may seem little, have a massive ripple effect throughout time and space.
[02:54:27.341 --> 02:54:29.121]  We're actually winning the Info Award.
[02:54:29.121 --> 02:54:39.306]  And when you realize that Bandot Video has hundreds and hundreds of censored directors and investigative journalists and talk show hosts whose information is beyond incredible.
[02:54:39.306 --> 02:54:41.487]  Hundreds of medical doctors and scientists.
[02:54:41.487 --> 02:54:45.028]  All of them, right now, telling the truth at Bandot Video.
[02:54:45.028 --> 02:54:47.589]  Millions of people a day visiting Bandot Video.
[02:54:47.589 --> 02:54:50.871]  But you can take that information and cause a bigger ripple effect.
[02:54:51.331 --> 02:55:15.421]  Amplifying effect and make sure it gets out to your friends your family your neighbors and perfect strangers You are the modern Paul Revere's you are what takes our information and amplifies it when you decide to take action We as a species and as a race are invincible So I thank you all for your past action and I challenge you to redouble your efforts now because humanity and the children are counting on
[02:55:20.723 --> 02:55:24.485]  Humanity is in a very dangerous position right now.
[02:55:24.485 --> 02:55:38.073]  Powerful corporations using military-grade psychological warfare programs are rolling out a biomedical tyranny worldwide at World ID, a cashless society, a social credit score, a universal basic income.
[02:55:38.553 --> 02:55:43.054]  Where every facet of your life is tracked, surveilled, and controlled.
[02:55:43.054 --> 02:55:53.056]  If you think the censorship and surveillance you've seen so far by the deep state and big tech was bad, that is just the opening salvo of their attack.
[02:55:53.056 --> 02:56:01.698]  Humanity and all of our hard-fought liberties and freedoms and all of our safeguards are literally on the edge of a cliff.
[02:56:01.698 --> 02:56:03.678]  But without InfoWars on the air,
[02:56:04.685 --> 02:56:08.610]  The general public is not going to be aware of the enemy operations.
[02:56:08.610 --> 02:56:12.154]  We didn't just tell you about this whole poison shot rollout.
[02:56:12.154 --> 02:56:14.497]  First, three years ago, on record.
[02:56:14.497 --> 02:56:16.900]  We're also telling you what's coming next.
[02:56:16.900 --> 02:56:18.262]  We track the enemy.
[02:56:18.262 --> 02:56:22.888]  They're preparing new bioweapon releases and new poison mRNA frankenshots.
[02:56:23.508 --> 02:56:28.633]  Ladies and gentlemen, my family, your family, is at the edge of a cliff.
[02:56:28.633 --> 02:56:42.545]  Bill Gates, Klaus Schwab, the UN, the WHO is literally pushing us over into that castle society hell grid, into that biomedical tyranny that will be even worse than what you see in Communist China, that is the current main laboratory of this control.
[02:56:42.545 --> 02:56:44.427]  We have to first recognize there is a cliff,
[02:56:45.027 --> 02:56:50.131]  We have to recognize that millions of people have been forced into these deadly shots and pushed over the cliff and died.
[02:56:50.131 --> 02:56:55.214]  Tens of millions more are sick and dying from these poisonous shots.
[02:56:55.214 --> 02:56:59.837]  Every one of you watching knows someone who took the shot and died or who became deathly ill.
[02:56:59.837 --> 02:57:02.439]  And their own documents show they know this is deadly.
[02:57:02.939 --> 02:57:03.539]  And what do they do?
[02:57:03.539 --> 02:57:09.321]  They push and push and push, and say, well, it's up to you, but we'll take your rights and freedoms away if you don't take it.
[02:57:09.321 --> 02:57:13.243]  Stand up to the tyrants who think they own your body, but they own my body.
[02:57:13.243 --> 02:57:18.205]  And spread the word, and share the articles, the videos, like your life depends on it, from InfoWars.com.
[02:57:18.205 --> 02:57:19.085]  Because it does!
[02:57:20.822 --> 02:57:33.472]  Mark Twain, one of America's greatest writers and satirists and minds, famously said more than 150 years ago, rumors of his demise had been greatly exaggerated.
[02:57:33.472 --> 02:57:36.714]  Because the newspapers kept saying he died decades before he did die.
[02:57:36.714 --> 02:57:39.796]  And it's the same psy-op today.
[02:57:39.796 --> 02:57:46.662]  InfoWars is more influential and more powerful than ever because of your support, and because the facts of what we've covered is coming true.
[02:57:48.217 --> 02:57:49.137]  We're good to go.
[02:58:10.546 --> 02:58:13.148]  Right now, I'm telling the truth at Band.Video.
[02:58:13.148 --> 02:58:15.710]  Millions of people a day visiting Band.Video.
[02:58:15.710 --> 02:58:25.297]  But you can take that information and cause a bigger ripple effect, an amplifying effect, and make sure it gets out to your friends, your family, your neighbors, and perfect strangers.
[02:58:25.297 --> 02:58:27.839]  You are the modern Paul Reveres.
[02:58:27.839 --> 02:58:30.701]  You are what takes our information and amplifies it.
[02:58:31.001 --> 02:58:36.229]  When you decide to take action, we as a species and as a race are invincible.
[02:58:36.229 --> 02:58:43.680]  So I thank you all for your past action, and I challenge you to redouble your efforts now, because humanity and the children are counting on you.
[02:58:49.195 --> 02:58:58.379]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are now launching the most powerful supplements in the history of InfoWars under a new brand name, InfoWars Platinum.
[02:58:58.379 --> 02:59:07.524]  Now, all three of these revolutionary products you see in front of you are already number one best sellers in the market for the last few years because they work so well.
[02:59:08.044 --> 02:59:14.648]  We've gone right to the manufacturer, who are listeners, the owners of Fan, and they've given us this huge deal off of retail.
[02:59:14.648 --> 02:59:20.111]  40% off what these products are found for under other names.
[02:59:20.111 --> 02:59:21.672]  And not just under one name.
[02:59:21.672 --> 02:59:27.155]  They sell these under three or four other brands that other major distributors and suppliers have put out.
[02:59:27.155 --> 02:59:31.238]  The difference is, we have it for 40% off what it is in stores.
[02:59:31.678 --> 02:59:33.559]  We're talking about Pain MD.
[02:59:33.559 --> 02:59:36.240]  We're talking about HGH Max Boost.
[02:59:36.240 --> 02:59:39.081]  We're talking about 1776 Testosterone Boost.
[02:59:39.081 --> 02:59:40.902]  These things are incredible.
[02:59:40.902 --> 02:59:46.825]  I would suggest you take half a dose or less when you first do and consult your health care provider because they're so powerful.
[02:59:46.825 --> 02:59:52.087]  Get them at InfoWorksStore.com.
[02:59:52.087 --> 02:59:56.009]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:00:07.066 --> 03:00:11.868]  Wow, Kelvin, we are hosting the Alex Jones fourth hour.
[03:00:11.868 --> 03:00:14.369]  What an honor and a privilege here in New Zealand.
[03:00:14.369 --> 03:00:15.150]  What is the date?
[03:00:15.150 --> 03:00:20.212]  The date here in New Zealand, because we are your future, is the 13th of November.
[03:00:20.212 --> 03:00:22.853]  13th of January, Friday the 13th.
[03:00:22.853 --> 03:00:23.974]  Yes, and it is a great
[03:00:27.429 --> 03:00:30.030]  Honoured to be here from New Zealand.
[03:00:30.030 --> 03:00:30.510]  We're filling in.
[03:00:30.510 --> 03:00:33.130]  This is our first show back for 2023.
[03:00:33.130 --> 03:00:34.330]  It's been a massive year.
[03:00:34.330 --> 03:00:41.092]  So what we thought we'd get into today is just basically giving you guys a bit of an outline about what's happening here in New Zealand.
[03:00:41.092 --> 03:00:42.192]  It's crazy.
[03:00:42.192 --> 03:00:46.993]  Like the rest of the world, this globalist agenda is not stopping one bit.
[03:00:46.993 --> 03:00:52.594]  We will be bringing you an update on the Baby Will story that did go viral in December last year.
[03:00:52.594 --> 03:00:55.215]  We hosted the Truthathon as well for that.
[03:00:55.215 --> 03:00:55.875]  And we've got
[03:00:56.235 --> 03:01:02.422]  Some stuff about Jacinda that we want to talk about, and of course, we want to do a bit of a reflection, Calvin, of 2022.
[03:01:05.134 --> 03:01:09.636]  And what a year that was, and one we are very happy to forget.
[03:01:09.636 --> 03:01:13.979]  Absolutely, but some great things happened from our point of view here at Counterspin.
[03:01:13.979 --> 03:01:17.500]  And there you go, you see Jacinda Ardern with William, Prince William there.
[03:01:17.500 --> 03:01:22.263]  She's very much part of this global agenda, the World Economic Forum.
[03:01:22.263 --> 03:01:24.684]  She was also with Klaus Schwab.
[03:01:24.684 --> 03:01:26.305]  She was a global young leader.
[03:01:26.305 --> 03:01:27.926]  Many of you know that she is
[03:01:28.866 --> 03:01:35.594]  She's really rolling out this agenda here in New Zealand and it's just absolutely shocking what's going on.
[03:01:35.594 --> 03:01:47.869]  We wanted to play you a little clip as well before we get going of Dr McCullough where he actually names Jacinda Ardern and a number of other people who are at the head of this rollout with Covid and all the vaccines.
[03:01:48.430 --> 03:01:50.872]  But let's name some names when we say they.
[03:01:50.872 --> 03:01:52.453]  I think it's fair to say this.
[03:01:52.453 --> 03:01:55.576]  So let me throw out a name and you tell me if they're in or out.
[03:01:55.576 --> 03:01:57.318]  How about Klaus Schwab?
[03:01:57.318 --> 03:02:02.642]  Nobody will be safe if not everybody is vaccinated.
[03:02:02.642 --> 03:02:03.403]  Klaus Schwab in.
[03:02:04.329 --> 03:02:05.430]  Bill Gates.
[03:02:05.430 --> 03:02:13.354]  Normalcy only returns when we've largely vaccinated the entire global population.
[03:02:13.354 --> 03:02:25.062]  The fatality rate, you know, we didn't understand that it's a fairly low fatality rate and that it's a disease mainly of the elderly, kind of like flu is, although a bit different than that.
[03:02:25.062 --> 03:02:25.982]  In.
[03:02:25.982 --> 03:02:29.264]  Jacinda A. Hearn, Prime Minister of New Zealand.
[03:02:29.264 --> 03:02:32.066]  Uh, frankly, conspiracy theories.
[03:02:32.066 --> 03:02:32.126]  In.
[03:02:33.530 --> 03:02:34.991]  Justin Trudeau, Canada.
[03:02:34.991 --> 03:02:45.474]  People fall prey to disinformation and if Conservative MPs and others want to start talking about conspiracy theories, well that's their choice.
[03:02:45.474 --> 03:02:46.194]  In.
[03:02:46.194 --> 03:02:46.975]  President Biden.
[03:02:46.975 --> 03:02:47.855]  Let me say that again.
[03:02:47.855 --> 03:02:51.636]  It's a pandemic of the unvaccinated.
[03:02:51.636 --> 03:02:52.457]  In.
[03:02:52.457 --> 03:02:53.177]  Ashish Jha.
[03:02:54.121 --> 03:02:55.342]  I don't know that name.
[03:02:55.342 --> 03:02:58.103]  He's the current White House coronavirus coordinator.
[03:02:58.103 --> 03:02:59.043]  Don't wait.
[03:02:59.043 --> 03:03:00.244]  Get your COVID shot.
[03:03:00.244 --> 03:03:01.345]  Get your flu shot.
[03:03:01.345 --> 03:03:06.447]  That's why God gave you two arms and one in each arm if you want.
[03:03:06.447 --> 03:03:07.447]  Anthony Fauci.
[03:03:07.447 --> 03:03:13.430]  So maybe it doesn't work and they're simply not telling you that.
[03:03:13.430 --> 03:03:15.952]  That's just a typical crazy conspiracy theory.
[03:03:17.731 --> 03:03:19.853]  Robert Califf, head of the FDA.
[03:03:19.853 --> 03:03:21.214]  Right now, the U.S.
[03:03:21.214 --> 03:03:27.020]  is a place where there's a lot of work to do to figure out what's happened recently.
[03:03:27.020 --> 03:03:30.824]  So tech savvy, and yet life expectancy going backwards.
[03:03:30.824 --> 03:03:35.909]  How about Peter Marks, FDA Vaccine Advisory Committee?
[03:03:36.914 --> 03:03:44.617]  There is a lot of misinformation about the new COVID-19 bivalent vaccines, and this misinformation is dangerous to public health.
[03:03:44.617 --> 03:03:54.220]  We know some parents are having a hard time deciding whether to vaccinate their children against COVID-19, but there are considerable risks to not getting your child vaccinated.
[03:03:54.220 --> 03:03:56.981]  In.
[03:03:56.981 --> 03:04:02.183]  How about Dr. Rubin, editor of New England Journal of Medicine?
[03:04:02.183 --> 03:04:03.684]  They seem very safe.
[03:04:03.684 --> 03:04:06.125]  They seem very comparable to other vaccines.
[03:04:09.013 --> 03:04:09.674]  There you go.
[03:04:09.674 --> 03:04:13.659]  And as you can see, that narrative just gets rolled out all around the country.
[03:04:13.659 --> 03:04:14.420]  It's just the same.
[03:04:14.420 --> 03:04:16.542]  And it's really important that you guys
[03:04:17.955 --> 03:04:29.405]  Support platforms like InfoWars and, you know, we just want to say a big thank you to Alex Jones and the InfoWars team for having us on and for having our channel, Counterspin Media, since November 11th, 2021.
[03:04:29.405 --> 03:04:33.409]  It's just been fantastic to get New Zealand out there.
[03:04:33.409 --> 03:04:39.834]  It's just, yeah, it's given us a real opportunity to bring our small nation's story to the world and we just really want to encourage you to get behind the
[03:04:40.815 --> 03:04:43.659]  All the great nutraceuticals that they have on offer.
[03:04:43.659 --> 03:04:47.103]  The Real Red Pill Plus is back.
[03:04:47.103 --> 03:04:52.249]  There's 50% off at the moment, so please check that out with the dangerous toxins that lie within our water.
[03:04:52.249 --> 03:04:56.894]  We know we need to filter out the bacteria, but as you age, filtering out all of the...
[03:04:57.859 --> 03:05:02.381]  Introducing our new incredible supplement line, InfoWars MD.
[03:05:02.381 --> 03:05:14.825]  Now in 60 seconds, it's hard to tell you how incredible these products are, but all of these products are already sold on store shelves under other brand names for up to twice the cost we're selling it to you.
[03:05:14.825 --> 03:05:16.006]  These are high-end.
[03:05:16.006 --> 03:05:17.066]  These are the very best.
[03:05:17.386 --> 03:05:19.867]  You know our Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula is amazing?
[03:05:19.867 --> 03:05:20.387]  Well, guess what?
[03:05:20.387 --> 03:05:26.170]  We now have Turmeric 95 that's basically the same formula for a lower price.
[03:05:26.170 --> 03:05:28.811]  CBD oil of the highest quality.
[03:05:28.811 --> 03:05:35.673]  Up to 50% less than major competitors selling the exact high-quality, full-spectrum CBD.
[03:05:35.673 --> 03:05:40.896]  And it goes on for all the new InfoWars MD products at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:05:40.896 --> 03:05:41.856]  The highest quality.
[03:05:42.156 --> 03:05:50.950]  Directly from the manufacturer to your door at prices up to 50% in some cases 100% lower than what they're sold for in stores.
[03:05:50.950 --> 03:05:52.934]  M4 Wars MD and M4WarsStore.com
[03:06:06.807 --> 03:06:12.552]  And we are back on the Info Wars fourth hour here at Counterspin Media.
[03:06:12.552 --> 03:06:15.495]  Calvin and Hannah coming to you from New Zealand.
[03:06:15.495 --> 03:06:21.780]  Now you may have been following what happened last year 2022 in February.
[03:06:21.780 --> 03:06:29.407]  There was a convoy that was very much inspired by the Canadian truckers convoy and what we'd like to do now is actually
[03:06:31.468 --> 03:06:32.569]  Get the B-roll running.
[03:06:32.569 --> 03:06:37.514]  And the convoy came from the North Island all the way to Wellington and from the South Island all the way up to Wellington.
[03:06:37.514 --> 03:06:38.595]  They had to cross over.
[03:06:38.595 --> 03:06:46.422]  And what you're seeing here now, Kelvin, are images from outside Parliament where thousands of people were camped out for three weeks.
[03:06:46.422 --> 03:06:49.024]  Tens of thousands of people were cleaning up daily.
[03:06:49.024 --> 03:06:53.988]  And there were some, of course, as you can see, who decided to make Parliament grounds their own, because it is.
[03:06:53.988 --> 03:06:57.772]  And they decided it was time to send a message to Government, to State,
[03:06:58.464 --> 03:07:00.586]  That we're not going to take it anymore.
[03:07:00.586 --> 03:07:04.488]  In fact, they played that song quite a lot.
[03:07:04.488 --> 03:07:09.472]  This here, within a 10 day period, there was a fully functioning town.
[03:07:09.472 --> 03:07:10.353]  It had everything.
[03:07:10.353 --> 03:07:11.593]  It had supply lines.
[03:07:11.593 --> 03:07:12.534]  It had medical.
[03:07:12.534 --> 03:07:15.156]  It had daycare for children.
[03:07:15.156 --> 03:07:20.520]  It had everything you could possibly want in a town environment.
[03:07:20.520 --> 03:07:27.485]  Unfortunately, the government didn't like the fact that we were camping on their lawn and decided to send
[03:07:28.146 --> 03:07:32.770]  Over 800 police officers in to quash it.
[03:07:32.770 --> 03:07:34.911]  Now a lot of violence was seen.
[03:07:34.911 --> 03:07:44.779]  We were reporting live throughout and we were bringing these scenes to the public, unfiltered, by the mainstream lens.
[03:07:44.779 --> 03:07:47.221]  And as you can see there, there's a lot of brutality going on.
[03:07:47.221 --> 03:07:55.047]  In fact, people had broken sternums, they had fractured skulls, broken bones, many were pepper sprayed and gassed.
[03:07:56.539 --> 03:07:59.240]  And it was a very peaceful protest.
[03:07:59.240 --> 03:08:11.246]  On the last day only did we have people that were not part of that protest turn up to cause a major problem in order to then have them say, see, we were justified in doing what we did.
[03:08:11.246 --> 03:08:18.070]  Well, we know this sort of thing happens quite a lot throughout the world in different protests.
[03:08:19.641 --> 03:08:38.562]  And in that first week, Kelvin, in day three, now what we're seeing, this is the last day where fires were started and people were actually saying that there was controlled opposition agent provocateurs who were starting this mayhem and it was very much reported in the mainstream media to be like January 6th where they were trying to obviously
[03:08:39.443 --> 03:09:07.786]  Storm into the capital and they were trying to draw the comparison but in fact it was completely different and you see there the lines of police and like I was going to say in the first week protesters held the line against the police for 12 hours and they didn't relent and so they managed to stay for another two to three weeks in total and then this last day was just absolutely devastating and there you go the pepper spray they had rubber bullets and it was just absolutely horrific
[03:09:08.426 --> 03:09:15.593]  And for a small nation like New Zealand, we hadn't seen a big convergence on Parliament like this since the 1980s.
[03:09:15.593 --> 03:09:25.142]  And it really was such an amazing, and you'll see there, there are brown faces there, but of course the mainstream media was reporting that it was full of white supremacists, the Nazis.
[03:09:25.142 --> 03:09:25.802]  Far right.
[03:09:25.802 --> 03:09:27.124]  We all seem to be far right.
[03:09:27.124 --> 03:09:29.786]  I'm still trying to find where the centre is.
[03:09:29.786 --> 03:09:32.889]  And if they mean far right by you're absolutely correct, we will take that.
[03:09:33.479 --> 03:09:36.382]  But other than that, I have no idea what the hell we're talking about.
[03:09:36.382 --> 03:09:39.665]  And it's, yeah, it's just the same playbook around the world.
[03:09:39.665 --> 03:09:47.654]  Counterspin was demonised for apparently, you know, causing a lot of the interest in this event.
[03:09:47.654 --> 03:09:56.543]  But so many of you saw what was happening in that first week when the first lot of police came in, and you could not do anything except get down there because it was just so horrific.
[03:09:56.983 --> 03:10:01.526]  Now, after this whole event, there was so much depression because it was actually such an amazing event.
[03:10:01.526 --> 03:10:03.107]  You know, as we said, it was all free.
[03:10:03.107 --> 03:10:10.731]  You know, everyone was just working together to hold the ground against the mandates, the government overreach, the tyranny that was coming out in New Zealand.
[03:10:10.731 --> 03:10:18.356]  Now, what we did after that is we decided, because people wanted us to carry on, we went on tour around New Zealand.
[03:10:18.356 --> 03:10:25.881]  Now, we just want to play you a clip here of the Let's Not Forget Tour, where we want to lift everybody's spirits after that depressing moment in Wellington on March the 2nd.
[03:10:27.591 --> 03:10:33.836]  Okay, it's Storm's maiden full glory presentation to the people.
[03:10:33.836 --> 03:10:42.003]  So, she's got her decals on, she's looking amazing and we're on the bus and we can't wait to meet the people of Wanganui.
[03:10:42.003 --> 03:10:43.124]  The storm is upon us.
[03:10:44.543 --> 03:10:46.244]  It's nice coming.
[03:10:46.244 --> 03:10:49.326]  We've got Paris, our wonderful driver there at the front.
[03:10:49.326 --> 03:10:51.487]  Made the trek down from Tauranga.
[03:10:51.487 --> 03:10:53.568]  And we are of course in Whanganui.
[03:10:53.568 --> 03:10:54.869]  We are indeed.
[03:10:54.869 --> 03:11:00.613]  And we look forward to meeting all the people.
[03:11:00.613 --> 03:11:01.133]  And we're off.
[03:11:07.794 --> 03:11:11.316]  And here we have the Counterspin bus.
[03:11:11.316 --> 03:11:13.517]  The storm is coming.
[03:11:13.517 --> 03:11:15.558]  Here we are.
[03:11:15.558 --> 03:11:23.661]  There's Dana, our tour manager.
[03:11:23.661 --> 03:11:25.202]  Truth, courage, freedom.
[03:11:25.202 --> 03:11:29.104]  New Zealand's media revolution, Counterspin.
[03:11:29.104 --> 03:11:35.026]  How beautiful does it look, team?
[03:11:35.026 --> 03:11:36.107]  Look at that!
[03:11:39.953 --> 03:11:43.594]  For the people, by the people.
[03:11:43.594 --> 03:11:47.934]  Down the way as it's progressing in.
[03:11:47.934 --> 03:11:52.115]  That is stunning.
[03:11:52.115 --> 03:11:53.615]  We're live streaming here from Wanganui.
[03:11:53.615 --> 03:11:55.076]  We're just about to go have a quick change.
[03:11:55.076 --> 03:11:55.996]  We'll see you soon.
[03:11:55.996 --> 03:11:56.836]  Look forward to it guys.
[03:11:56.836 --> 03:12:05.077]  See you in there.
[03:12:05.077 --> 03:12:07.818]  And Kelvin, how did you find that tour?
[03:12:07.818 --> 03:12:08.878]  It was an amazing tour actually.
[03:12:08.878 --> 03:12:09.418]  We got to see
[03:12:10.649 --> 03:12:14.131]  All parts of the country and we got to hear everybody's stories.
[03:12:14.131 --> 03:12:16.272]  In fact, we took the show to them.
[03:12:16.272 --> 03:12:21.895]  We gave them the mic so they could get everything that they had locked up inside out.
[03:12:21.895 --> 03:12:25.636]  We asked polling questions at every event.
[03:12:25.636 --> 03:12:28.958]  How many people know those who have been injured by this jab?
[03:12:29.708 --> 03:12:32.350]  I refuse to call it a vaccine because it is not.
[03:12:32.350 --> 03:12:33.210]  It is a jab.
[03:12:33.210 --> 03:12:37.052]  It's a weapon that's causing a lot of carnage, certainly here in New Zealand.
[03:12:37.052 --> 03:12:48.519]  Dr Guy Hatchard, who will be on with us in the next segment, will attest to that and bring the actual stats to bear to show you exactly what's happening here.
[03:12:48.519 --> 03:12:51.561]  I think you'll have the same thing in the US and in other parts of the Western world.
[03:12:52.145 --> 03:13:01.834]  Yeah, and we had a lot of people also sharing their experiences from down in Wellington, either the police brutality or their amazing uplifting experiences down there.
[03:13:01.834 --> 03:13:11.563]  It was really because New Zealand was smashed after the Wellington protests ended in such a violent way because we have 120 politicians here in New Zealand at the Beehive.
[03:13:11.923 --> 03:13:17.628]  And not one single one of them came out to talk to the protesters and see what they were about.
[03:13:17.628 --> 03:13:26.957]  The mainstream media was absolutely silencing the voices of the people and they were twisting the narrative and demonised the protesters.
[03:13:26.957 --> 03:13:30.400]  You have 120 parasites there in the room, leeching off the people.
[03:13:30.780 --> 03:13:31.640]  Yes, exactly.
[03:13:31.640 --> 03:13:34.981]  So that was part of the tour and people really loved it.
[03:13:34.981 --> 03:13:38.242]  And like Kelvin said, we did a lot of stories.
[03:13:38.242 --> 03:13:45.504]  But what we want to tell you now is that we were actually arrested and they stole the footage that we got on that tour.
[03:13:45.504 --> 03:13:50.725]  Now this happened after a documentary came out called Fire and Fury.
[03:13:50.725 --> 03:13:55.266]  Now we have a little clip of that that was made by mainstream media here in New Zealand.
[03:14:00.251 --> 03:14:04.315]  And in 2021, ALP launched Counterspin Media.
[03:14:04.315 --> 03:14:05.636]  We must hold the line.
[03:14:05.636 --> 03:14:06.677]  We are in a war.
[03:14:06.677 --> 03:14:08.058]  It's an information war.
[03:14:08.058 --> 03:14:15.045]  A far-right online TV channel running at that stage on the platform of former Trump campaign chief Steve Bannon.
[03:14:15.045 --> 03:14:18.849]  Are you prepared to give it up and let these elites take it and just give it away?
[03:14:20.771 --> 03:14:24.432]  That's the power that elected Donald Trump.
[03:14:24.432 --> 03:14:26.673]  Bannon believes the 2020 U.S.
[03:14:26.673 --> 03:14:31.435]  election was stolen and calls mainstream media the opposition.
[03:14:31.435 --> 03:14:41.619]  And all the mainstream media hailed as the great podium of truth, I call it bulls**t, has turned out to be completely false, fake, phony liars.
[03:14:41.619 --> 03:14:43.400]  Incredible.
[03:14:43.400 --> 03:14:44.120]  Absolutely incredible.
[03:14:44.588 --> 03:14:52.690]  This is about identity making and meaning making, to claim a space of leadership, a claim of space of importance.
[03:14:52.690 --> 03:14:56.431]  So if the military command is watching this, and I guarantee you they will be.
[03:14:56.431 --> 03:15:05.433]  Counterspin live streams throughout the Wellington occupation, with Elk repeatedly calling for an overthrow of the government, including a military coup.
[03:15:05.433 --> 03:15:09.254]  We'll be happy for it to be in your safe hands.
[03:15:09.254 --> 03:15:09.614]  Very good.
[03:15:11.195 --> 03:15:19.842]  The criminals that occupy Parasite Palace, last thing they couldn't be right, need to be gone.
[03:15:19.842 --> 03:15:24.285]  Fellow Counterspin presenter Hannah Spera is Calvin Elf's partner.
[03:15:24.285 --> 03:15:28.169]  She describes herself as an anti-feminist and a patriot.
[03:15:29.221 --> 03:15:33.324]  To resist, of course, this tyrannical government which is not going to stop.
[03:15:33.324 --> 03:15:42.811]  It's a system, of course, as we all know, just going around the globe and, um, you know, at this point it's slavery versus freedom.
[03:15:42.811 --> 03:15:51.057]  And that was absolutely atrocious there, Cowan, trying to slander you and trying to say that you were actually trying to instigate some sort of overthrow is absolutely false.
[03:15:51.057 --> 03:15:56.261]  On the other side of the break, when we come back, we'll have Dr Guy Hatchard, but we'll explain a little more on that beforehand.
[03:15:57.944 --> 03:16:04.892]  The powerful combination of both vitamin C and zinc are great stepping stones to leading a healthier life.
[03:16:04.892 --> 03:16:10.779]  InfoWars has made it easier to make sure you are getting enough in your system with a supplement that contains both.
[03:16:10.779 --> 03:16:17.126]  This InfoWars Life Offering Vitamin C Plus Zinc with Rose Hips should be your next purchase from the InfoWars store.
[03:16:17.446 --> 03:16:24.671]  The rose hips contained within are a part of the rose flower just below the petals that contain the rose plant seeds.
[03:16:24.671 --> 03:16:34.959]  Natural chemicals found in the hips may even be helpful for a variety of health conditions, including those with osteoarthritis and for those with pain after surgery, studies have shown.
[03:16:35.359 --> 03:16:44.365]  As for vitamin C and zinc themselves, you probably already know that they play an important role in nutrition, immune defense, and the maintenance of your everyday health.
[03:16:44.365 --> 03:16:50.950]  It has been reported that intake of both is often inadequate, even in affluent populations like here in America.
[03:16:50.950 --> 03:16:57.174]  So next time you visit, be sure to check it out at InfoWarsTore.com, where we promise our rose hips don't lie.
[03:16:57.774 --> 03:17:02.318]  I've taken a lot of supplements over the years, since high school, and they had great effects.
[03:17:02.318 --> 03:17:06.021]  And the science has gotten better and better and better over the years.
[03:17:06.021 --> 03:17:16.850]  And now, with all the things we're bombarded with, and the water and the food and the feminizing factors, it is more important than ever to use the compounds God gave us to boost our natural male potential.
[03:17:16.850 --> 03:17:18.152]  These products work great for women as well.
[03:17:18.812 --> 03:17:21.214]  Ladies and gentlemen, we have Pain MD.
[03:17:21.214 --> 03:17:23.696]  It's a number one national bestseller under another name.
[03:17:23.696 --> 03:17:29.502]  We got it discounted for 40% off InfoWarsTore.com under the label InfoWars Platinum.
[03:17:29.502 --> 03:17:31.764]  We've also got HGH Max Boost.
[03:17:31.764 --> 03:17:33.065]  Read all about it.
[03:17:33.065 --> 03:17:34.426]  Be very safe with it.
[03:17:34.426 --> 03:17:37.849]  I'd take only a fraction of what they say at first and take it before you go to bed at night.
[03:17:37.849 --> 03:17:39.371]  Don't do it during the day.
[03:17:39.371 --> 03:17:42.393]  1776 testosterone boost.
[03:17:42.393 --> 03:17:43.454]  Totally incredible.
[03:17:43.454 --> 03:17:44.395]  Go read about them.
[03:17:44.395 --> 03:17:45.176]  Learn more about them.
[03:17:45.496 --> 03:17:50.440]  At InfoWarsStore.com in the InfoWars Platinum section.
[03:17:50.440 --> 03:17:57.304]  And you get 40% off on these already best-selling products under the new name InfoWars Platinum.
[03:17:57.304 --> 03:18:00.307]  They want the planet for themselves, my friends.
[03:18:00.307 --> 03:18:04.830]  But we're so stupid we let them tell us we deserve it.
[03:18:04.830 --> 03:18:10.394]  Except children don't deserve it, do they?
[03:18:10.394 --> 03:18:11.915]  And I looked.
[03:18:14.354 --> 03:18:30.277]  And behold, a pale horse, and he that sat on the horse was named Death.
[03:18:30.277 --> 03:18:40.120]  Another translation is, I looked, and behold, a pale horse, and his name that sat on him was Death, and Hell followed with him.
[03:18:40.120 --> 03:18:42.180]  The Book of Revelation.
[03:18:44.266 --> 03:18:45.908]  Very serious times to be alive, folks.
[03:18:45.908 --> 03:18:47.630]  They're not just doing this as a one-off.
[03:18:47.630 --> 03:18:49.192]  This is the beginning of the rest of our lives.
[03:18:49.192 --> 03:18:50.554]  This is our fight.
[03:18:50.554 --> 03:18:51.896]  And I'm proud of humanity.
[03:18:51.896 --> 03:18:53.378]  The Globalists even admit it's leaked.
[03:18:53.378 --> 03:18:57.343]  They're very upset that they're losing and that this hasn't gone the way they thought it would.
[03:18:57.343 --> 03:18:59.526]  InfoWarsMD is finally here.
[03:19:00.567 --> 03:19:17.252]  It's the very same high quality products you've been getting through InfoWars Life but an expanded catalog and in some cases the prices are lower because we're going directly to the source that was supplying the supplement companies that we were buying our high quality products from.
[03:19:17.252 --> 03:19:23.694]  So we're able to lower prices and bring you more products via the InfoWars MD line.
[03:19:23.694 --> 03:19:26.275]  The highest quality, triple tested.
[03:19:26.275 --> 03:19:30.056]  Many of these products are sold on store shelves for more than twice the cost
[03:19:30.216 --> 03:19:34.720]  You'll get them at InfoWarsStore.com under our exclusive label.
[03:19:34.720 --> 03:19:40.625]  We're bringing you the highest quality supplements directly from the factory right here in the USA to your door.
[03:19:40.625 --> 03:19:46.510]  It'll make your life healthy, better, boost your immune system, and it keeps InfoWars Store on the air.
[03:19:46.510 --> 03:19:53.516]  So again, introducing InfoWars MD, now exclusively available at InfoWarsStore.com with massive, massive savings.
[03:19:58.692 --> 03:20:03.286]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[03:20:03.286 --> 03:20:04.610]  It's Alex Jones!
[03:20:15.888 --> 03:20:21.391]  Great, and welcome back to the fourth hour on the Alex Jones Show, hosted by Hannah and Kelvin from Counterspin.
[03:20:21.391 --> 03:20:31.936]  We are going to bring Guy Hatchard on shortly, but before we do that, we just wanted to explain from that previous segment, what happened to Kelvin after that Fire and Fury documentary aired ten days later?
[03:20:31.936 --> 03:20:35.138]  Ten days later, we were arrested on August 25th last year.
[03:20:35.138 --> 03:20:37.119]  We've had three court appearances so far.
[03:20:37.119 --> 03:20:39.200]  The arrest was for sharing a link
[03:20:39.830 --> 03:20:49.518]  To a foreign website, a UK investigative documentary that was going on into the incident that we had here in Christchurch, March 15th, 2019.
[03:20:49.518 --> 03:20:51.540]  Apparently, they don't like questions being asked.
[03:20:51.540 --> 03:20:55.924]  They don't like real investigative journalism that's saying, hey, your official narrative stinks.
[03:20:55.924 --> 03:20:58.386]  We've got more holes than Swiss cheese.
[03:20:58.386 --> 03:21:03.250]  And in true fashion, we're holding the line.
[03:21:03.250 --> 03:21:04.832]  We're not taking our foot off the gas.
[03:21:04.832 --> 03:21:06.313]  And we are going to push back on that.
[03:21:06.853 --> 03:21:13.201]  Yes, Kelvin, and that link was actually posted way back in February and it took them over six months to actually get their case sorted.
[03:21:13.201 --> 03:21:14.824]  They didn't give us a takedown order.
[03:21:14.824 --> 03:21:18.669]  They didn't ask us to remove the link or review anything that we had done.
[03:21:18.669 --> 03:21:21.352]  We didn't actually post any... Here's the kicker.
[03:21:21.352 --> 03:21:23.575]  It was made objectionable after it was posted.
[03:21:24.830 --> 03:21:35.518]  Yes, and that is very interesting, and we haven't shared any footage of the live stream that the shooter put out, Brenton Currant, because of course that was deemed objectionable, and also the manifesto.
[03:21:35.518 --> 03:21:46.566]  So we haven't done anything like that, and yet still, we are facing 14 years in jail, and if you would like to help us out, Counterspinitmedia.com, our legal fees are starting to mount up.
[03:21:46.986 --> 03:21:50.510]  So, like everywhere, if you're telling the truth, they come after you.
[03:21:50.510 --> 03:21:56.317]  And just before we bring Guy on now, we also want to give you a quick update on Baby Will.
[03:21:56.317 --> 03:21:58.760]  Many of you will have been following that story last year.
[03:22:02.003 --> 03:22:03.044]  They absolutely did.
[03:22:03.044 --> 03:22:11.629]  And of course, baby Will simply needed life-saving heart surgery and his parents wanted the unvaccinated blood.
[03:22:11.629 --> 03:22:22.295]  And here in New Zealand, the New Zealand Blood Donor Organisation would not allow the over 20 donors that the family already had lined up to give him the blood.
[03:22:22.295 --> 03:22:23.775]  They would not allow that to happen.
[03:22:23.775 --> 03:22:25.536]  So baby Will is doing very well.
[03:22:25.536 --> 03:22:27.658]  He went home just before Christmas.
[03:22:27.658 --> 03:22:28.778]  He's recovering at home.
[03:22:28.778 --> 03:22:29.399]  He's still getting
[03:22:30.599 --> 03:22:42.923]  Well of course everyone knows the various state actors took their parents to court to take guardianship to make that operation happen.
[03:22:42.923 --> 03:22:46.744]  We hear that there is suspicion that unjabbed blood was actually used.
[03:22:46.744 --> 03:22:48.685]  We will be able to confirm that shortly.
[03:22:50.262 --> 03:22:55.265]  So yeah, but my problem is the court case is still set and that's what I do not like.
[03:22:55.265 --> 03:23:07.072]  That's right and we now don't have a right to unjabbed blood and we're going to bring Guy Hatchard on now to talk about this very thing, the vaccines and exactly what's happening here in New Zealand.
[03:23:07.072 --> 03:23:08.813]  Yeah, they aren't a vaccine.
[03:23:09.213 --> 03:23:18.336]  Now, if you don't know Guy Hatchard, and our US audience probably doesn't, Guy is an international advocate for food safety and natural medicines.
[03:23:18.336 --> 03:23:22.558]  He received his undergraduate degree in logic and theoretical physics.
[03:23:22.558 --> 03:23:29.920]  He was formerly a senior manager at Genetic ID, a global food safety testing and certification laboratory.
[03:23:29.920 --> 03:23:32.401]  Welcome to the show, Guy.
[03:23:32.401 --> 03:23:32.741]  Welcome.
[03:23:33.556 --> 03:23:35.438]  Good to be good to be here.
[03:23:35.438 --> 03:23:38.940]  Good to be here with your global audience.
[03:23:38.940 --> 03:23:43.184]  And we're here in New Zealand.
[03:23:43.184 --> 03:23:50.570]  We're in a situation as many other countries are where we have excess all cause deaths.
[03:23:50.570 --> 03:23:53.812]  We have very few deaths from COVID.
[03:23:53.812 --> 03:23:55.533]  And what we're seeing is
[03:23:56.696 --> 03:24:09.316]  That the more injections that you have, the more susceptible you are to serious illness and death if you catch COVID.
[03:24:09.316 --> 03:24:10.258]  And we're
[03:24:12.061 --> 03:24:14.663]  I know that this is familiar to viewers.
[03:24:14.663 --> 03:24:16.724]  We're seeing it all over the world.
[03:24:16.724 --> 03:24:27.311]  We are in a unique position here in New Zealand, because we had a whole year when we didn't have any COVID, but we had the vaccinations.
[03:24:27.311 --> 03:24:36.817]  And so you can't blame the excess deaths on the COVID itself, because what we saw was that
[03:24:37.717 --> 03:24:44.622]  As the number of vaccinations increased, so did the rate of deaths.
[03:24:44.622 --> 03:24:52.827]  So we're sitting, we're kind of sitting back from this now, and we're thinking, well, what can we do about this?
[03:24:52.827 --> 03:24:54.408]  What do we face in the future?
[03:24:54.408 --> 03:25:02.914]  And the key point that I want to contribute this morning is the fact that what has happened is that we've
[03:25:03.792 --> 03:25:09.675]  Seeing that biotechnology is essentially very, very dangerous.
[03:25:09.675 --> 03:25:25.044]  So we've launched a global campaign, a campaign, we're calling it GLOBE, a campaign for global legislation to outlaw biotechnology experimentation.
[03:25:25.044 --> 03:25:26.705]  And I want to show you how this works.
[03:25:26.705 --> 03:25:30.727]  If we can have the slide that I have on the physiology as a whole.
[03:25:32.369 --> 03:25:34.626]  Yes, that should be image six, approximately.
[03:25:36.112 --> 03:25:38.833]  The physiology image and that's your Vaxxed image.
[03:25:38.833 --> 03:25:40.473]  We've got the Vaxxed stats up there first Guy.
[03:25:40.473 --> 03:26:01.417]  That's the Vaxxed image which basically shows in the dark green that as far as COVID deaths are concerned 53% in October were boosted and they accounted for 71% of the deaths and you can see from the green bar getting bigger and bigger that the situation is getting worse and worse.
[03:26:01.417 --> 03:26:04.438]  So let's move on to the next slide.
[03:26:06.141 --> 03:26:07.261]  That should be image seven.
[03:26:07.261 --> 03:26:08.982]  Yeah, there you go.
[03:26:08.982 --> 03:26:15.085]  This is, I think, absolutely critical to the whole issue that has come up.
[03:26:15.085 --> 03:26:23.748]  You know, what has happened now is that medical interventions are now the leading cause of death in the world.
[03:26:23.748 --> 03:26:25.869]  And that's what COVID has done for us.
[03:26:25.869 --> 03:26:28.290]  That's what COVID vaccination has done for us.
[03:26:28.290 --> 03:26:29.971]  We know COVID comes from a lab.
[03:26:30.851 --> 03:26:34.872]  And we know the vaccination interferes with the way our DNA works.
[03:26:34.872 --> 03:26:35.972]  How does it do that?
[03:26:35.972 --> 03:26:57.335]  Well, in this diagram, you can see that the DNA is the controlling center of intelligence in the physiology and the interface at the bottom of the chart between DNA and the rest of the physiology, all the macromolecules, the cells, tissues, organs and organ systems.
[03:26:57.335 --> 03:27:00.016]  The interface is the RNA.
[03:27:01.311 --> 03:27:09.933]  The RNA is what transfers information from the DNA and controls the way the body works.
[03:27:09.933 --> 03:27:17.255]  So mRNA vaccination changes the way that the RNA works.
[03:27:17.255 --> 03:27:30.679]  And that's why we're seeing such a huge range of side effects in the liver, in the kidneys, in the brain, neurological systems, in the heart, the circulatory systems, and so on.
[03:27:31.818 --> 03:27:35.561]  So this is absolutely dangerous technology.
[03:27:35.561 --> 03:27:45.370]  And so that's why we've launched this campaign, this campaign for global legislation outlawing biotechnology experimentation.
[03:27:45.370 --> 03:27:50.735]  And the center for that is our site globe.global.
[03:27:50.735 --> 03:27:54.058]  So we're launching this from New Zealand.
[03:27:54.058 --> 03:27:58.862]  And we're reaching out all across the world to basically say,
[03:27:59.508 --> 03:28:12.777]  We have a system that is a biotechnology system that is really affecting our health in every area of our health.
[03:28:12.777 --> 03:28:15.579]  It's unbelievable.
[03:28:15.579 --> 03:28:17.880]  People knew about this.
[03:28:17.880 --> 03:28:23.244]  People in biotechnology, I've worked in biotechnology, people knew that it was dangerous, but they went ahead.
[03:28:23.852 --> 03:28:24.553]  We're good to go.
[03:28:57.476 --> 03:29:00.499]  Look, it's not hype when you've delivered.
[03:29:00.499 --> 03:29:03.282]  And InfoWars has been the tip of spear against tyranny.
[03:29:03.282 --> 03:29:08.708]  And when it comes to products we sell to fund our operation, they're just like our news and information.
[03:29:08.708 --> 03:29:10.890]  They are powerful and they change the world.
[03:29:11.581 --> 03:29:17.445]  The Real Red Pill Plus is one of our top sellers, but for over two years, it's been sold out because of supply chain breakdowns.
[03:29:17.445 --> 03:29:20.167]  It's finally back in stock.
[03:29:20.167 --> 03:29:21.828]  We're 50% off at infomercial.com.
[03:29:21.828 --> 03:29:27.753]  Now, in the limited time we have, I can't get into all the ingredients that are in it, but this sucker is amazing.

[03:29:59.141 --> 03:30:03.884]  Silver Commander here with an important message to humanity.
[03:30:03.884 --> 03:30:11.789]  I have decided that all of you will take a special injection so that you will be safe.
[03:30:11.789 --> 03:30:15.331]  But the injection is not ready yet.
[03:30:15.331 --> 03:30:23.717]  And so, I need all of you to stay indoors for the next 15 days to flatten the curve.
[03:30:24.677 --> 03:30:32.582]  I also need you to wear masks, and I also need you to only shop at megacorporations.
[03:30:32.582 --> 03:30:43.007]  That way we can consolidate control and bankrupt the world economy, leaving companies that only I own profitable.
[03:30:43.007 --> 03:30:44.868]  You will then be my slaves, owners.
[03:30:46.530 --> 03:30:50.537]  And then you'll get that special shot of venom from Cobra.
[03:30:50.537 --> 03:30:56.467]  It will remove your immune system, so you'll be dependent on me for the rest of your miserable lives.
[03:30:57.429 --> 03:31:00.670]  InfoWars MD is finally here.
[03:31:00.670 --> 03:31:17.334]  It's the very same high quality products you've been getting through InfoWars Life, but an expanded catalog and in some cases the prices are lower because we're going directly to the source that was supplying the supplement companies that we were buying our high quality products from.
[03:31:17.334 --> 03:31:23.235]  So we're able to lower prices and bring you more products via the InfoWars MD line.
[03:31:23.795 --> 03:31:26.357]  The highest quality, triple testing.
[03:31:26.357 --> 03:31:30.299]  Many of these products are sold on store shelves for more than twice the cost.
[03:31:30.299 --> 03:31:34.822]  You'll get them at InfoWarsStore.com under our exclusive label.
[03:31:34.822 --> 03:31:40.746]  We're bringing you the highest quality supplements directly from the factory right here in the USA to your door.
[03:31:40.746 --> 03:31:46.590]  It'll make your life healthy, better, boost your immune system, and it keeps InfoWarsStore on the air.
[03:31:46.590 --> 03:31:53.575]  So again, introducing InfoWars MD, now exclusively available at InfoWarsStore.com with massive, massive savings.
[03:31:57.558 --> 03:32:10.187]  Mark Twain, one of America's greatest writers and satirists and minds, famously said more than 150 years ago, rumors of his demise had been greatly exaggerated.
[03:32:10.187 --> 03:32:13.410]  Because the newspapers kept saying he died decades before he did die.
[03:32:14.190 --> 03:32:16.492]  And it's the same PSYOP today.
[03:32:16.492 --> 03:32:24.077]  InfoWars is more influential and more powerful than ever because of your support, because the facts that we've covered is coming true.
[03:32:24.077 --> 03:32:32.423]  But if they can convince you we've been shut down, if they can convince you that we're going away, and you stop supporting, you stop spreading the word, then they do win.
[03:32:32.423 --> 03:32:38.588]  Ladies and gentlemen, there's only one group of people that can shut down InfoWars, and that's you, the viewers and listeners.
[03:32:39.088 --> 03:32:41.030]  If you decide we're done, we're done.
[03:32:41.030 --> 03:32:48.296]  If you decide to go to Infowarstore.com and get supplements and books and films and t-shirts and so much more, we will stay on the air indefinitely.
[03:32:48.296 --> 03:32:49.697]  It is all in your hands.
[03:32:49.697 --> 03:32:51.038]  So thanks for your support.
[03:32:51.038 --> 03:32:52.239]  Stand up against the globalists.
[03:32:52.239 --> 03:32:55.522]  Go to Infowarstore.com right now and keep us on air.
[03:32:55.522 --> 03:32:58.985]  It's up to you.
[03:32:58.985 --> 03:33:04.890]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:33:13.018 --> 03:33:20.342]  And now we are continuing our chat with Dr. Guy Hatchard because it's really important that we understand what's happening here in New Zealand.
[03:33:20.342 --> 03:33:35.771]  We have the Therapeutic Products Bill that was tabled to the New Zealand Parliament last year on the 30th of November and it's been through its first reading right before Christmas on the 14th of December when everyone was getting ready to wind down for the summer down here, down under.
[03:33:36.631 --> 03:33:46.243]  And of course it will go through for a second reading and submissions are due by the 15th of February here in New Zealand.
[03:33:46.243 --> 03:33:52.812]  So Dr Guy, please can you tell us why people need to be aware of the Therapeutics Bill and what are the problems with it?
[03:33:54.386 --> 03:33:57.970]  The Therapeutics Products Bill is an enabling bill.
[03:33:57.970 --> 03:34:11.284]  An enabling bill appoints a regulator and it says this regulator can do virtually whatever he wants to control our natural products and supplements and so on.
[03:34:11.284 --> 03:34:12.505]  So it's a blank check.
[03:34:13.152 --> 03:34:15.354]  And what exactly are they going to do?
[03:34:15.354 --> 03:34:27.022]  Well, the thrust of the bill is that the government wishes to control herbs, which are actually foods, by classing them as therapeutic products.
[03:34:27.022 --> 03:34:35.248]  And so anything that can benefit health can be classed as a therapeutic project.
[03:34:35.248 --> 03:34:37.209]  And as we know, most foods benefit health.
[03:34:38.058 --> 03:34:44.282]  And then they want to control the use of these and introduce synthetics.
[03:34:44.282 --> 03:34:54.008]  So here's a list of an extract from a list of 300 herbs which the Ministry of Health here wishes to control.
[03:34:54.008 --> 03:34:57.751]  And you can see there are some things that are very familiar to us.
[03:34:57.751 --> 03:35:02.274]  Coconut, tea leaf, cardamom, mustard,
[03:35:03.318 --> 03:35:11.806]  These are all common foods, actually, but the government wishes to classify them as therapeutic products.
[03:35:11.806 --> 03:35:16.331]  Amazing, absolutely amazing.
[03:35:16.331 --> 03:35:25.579]  At the same time, in the same list, it's actually a list of 5,000 ingredients, there are 3,000 synthetics which the government wants to introduce.
[03:35:28.403 --> 03:35:29.744]  For example, eggplant.
[03:35:29.744 --> 03:35:31.185]  Why are we controlling eggplant?
[03:35:31.185 --> 03:35:40.291]  Well, eggplant has some compounds in it which are similar to steroids and so they're beneficial in some particular way for the health.
[03:35:40.291 --> 03:35:46.155]  Our body knows how to absorb them because they're based on DNA and we are based on DNA.
[03:35:46.155 --> 03:35:54.101]  But in therapeutic products, the government would rather like to kowtow to the pharmaceutical industry
[03:35:54.915 --> 03:36:00.217]  And control the use of these in any supplements.
[03:36:00.217 --> 03:36:02.018]  The same thing is happening in the USA.
[03:36:02.018 --> 03:36:11.642]  The Biden administration has just called for all supplement and natural products manufacturers to register with the FDA.
[03:36:11.642 --> 03:36:20.365]  So this is coming and it's being driven by the International Coalition of Medicines Regulatory Authorities.
[03:36:21.357 --> 03:36:35.845]  Which is a non-governmental organization largely funded by the pharmaceutical industry which operates a database which is locked in to all the medicine regulatory authorities in countries around the world.
[03:36:35.845 --> 03:36:39.467]  So where is the government getting these ideas from?
[03:36:39.467 --> 03:36:45.551]  They're simply being fed in directly through information held in databases
[03:36:46.434 --> 03:36:55.720]  And in that way they want to regulate our whole food supply.
[03:36:55.720 --> 03:36:59.143]  It's a remarkable endeavour.
[03:36:59.143 --> 03:37:06.628]  So basically what they're doing is they're taking something natural like our own physiology that knows how to heal itself.
[03:37:06.628 --> 03:37:15.654]  Everything that was God-given on the earth, because I've always said that there's something natural for every element both known and as yet
[03:37:16.331 --> 03:37:17.271]  It's already happening.
[03:37:17.271 --> 03:37:24.413]  I mean, if you look at your labels in your supermarket, you might buy some vanilla ice cream, for example, and you look and it says it has natural vanilla flavor.
[03:37:24.413 --> 03:37:25.253]  Well, that's actually not
[03:37:44.201 --> 03:37:46.022]  Coming from the vanilla plant.
[03:37:46.022 --> 03:37:48.904]  It's coming from a biotechnology vat.
[03:37:48.904 --> 03:37:54.188]  If it was vanilla, it would have to say natural vanilla extract, real vanilla.
[03:37:54.188 --> 03:37:56.709]  This is happening across the board.
[03:37:56.709 --> 03:38:01.232]  All these synthetics are coming in and they're not the same as their natural counterparts.
[03:38:01.232 --> 03:38:04.534]  Our body is not necessarily adjusted to them.
[03:38:04.534 --> 03:38:08.457]  And what we're looking here is, you know, there are very few things left.
[03:38:09.928 --> 03:38:13.509]  And you know this, that we have control over these days.
[03:38:13.509 --> 03:38:16.350]  The government wants to control everything.
[03:38:16.350 --> 03:38:24.611]  We have, you know, we have our consciousness, we have our experience, we have our behavior and we also have our food.
[03:38:24.611 --> 03:38:34.554]  And now they want to take that food away from us and change basically what has been the subject of millions of years of evolution.
[03:38:34.554 --> 03:38:36.614]  We have a codependent
[03:38:37.282 --> 03:38:41.123]  Relationship with our sources of food, DNA.
[03:38:41.123 --> 03:39:01.011]  We're all part of the biological... Can I just cut in here and say how does that fit in with the Codex Alimentarius and what overarching organisations are doing, like the United Nations, and how are they trying to, yeah, basically get control of everything through the government policies?
[03:39:03.355 --> 03:39:07.160]  Yeah, there are many initiatives here.
[03:39:07.160 --> 03:39:15.490]  Principally, you know that there was a time when people were publishing rules and people were signing up for rules.
[03:39:15.490 --> 03:39:18.313]  This is how we're going to manage health or this is how we're going to do this.
[03:39:18.313 --> 03:39:19.895]  This is this agreement.
[03:39:19.895 --> 03:39:23.239]  But now it's done directly through information.
[03:39:24.366 --> 03:39:28.027]  It, you know, all these interlocking databases.
[03:39:28.027 --> 03:39:38.611]  So you have that CODIS Alimentaris, which was a, you know, a push to regulate our food supply and our medical system.
[03:39:38.611 --> 03:39:40.451]  But it's gone way beyond that.
[03:39:40.451 --> 03:39:49.094]  Now we have private operators in the global space between countries who are basically locked into government databases.
[03:39:49.913 --> 03:39:57.658]  And when a minister is deciding on a policy or a new law, he's simply fed a sheet of this is how it's done.
[03:39:57.658 --> 03:40:01.640]  And this is exactly what's happening here in New Zealand now.
[03:40:01.640 --> 03:40:04.521]  This is the third attempt to get this through.
[03:40:04.521 --> 03:40:10.365]  There have been big pushback from the population because of course 50% of people take natural products.
[03:40:10.925 --> 03:40:17.260]  But the government now is girding its loins and saying we're going to do this like Hitler did it basically.
[03:40:17.260 --> 03:40:20.788]  We're just going to pass a law that says this chap can tell everybody what to do.
[03:40:22.135 --> 03:40:31.964]  The other really concerning thing, Guy, is that this bill will implement the need for any natural practitioner to have a sponsor.
[03:40:31.964 --> 03:40:33.305]  Now, can you just elaborate on that?
[03:40:33.305 --> 03:40:39.570]  Because that is not actually a government-trained person, it's just somebody who has a good, reputable standing in the community.
[03:40:39.570 --> 03:40:47.297]  And they are basically going to become a spy for anybody who wants to have a natural practice or have natural therapies.
[03:40:48.743 --> 03:40:51.765]  Yeah, government will be looking over our shoulder.
[03:40:51.765 --> 03:40:56.908]  Pretty soon it'll be looking over our shoulder when we have our lunch.
[03:40:56.908 --> 03:40:58.990]  That's the extent of it.
[03:40:58.990 --> 03:41:01.331]  And look, it's an impossible task.
[03:41:01.331 --> 03:41:02.712]  There are 100,000 plants.
[03:41:02.712 --> 03:41:10.657]  They need an army of people to regulate 100,000 plants and control everybody.
[03:41:10.657 --> 03:41:12.698]  And it'll be prohibitively costly.
[03:41:12.698 --> 03:41:18.042]  In fact, the estimated cost of it runs into hundreds of millions.
[03:41:19.083 --> 03:41:22.585]  To put this kind of system in place.
[03:41:22.585 --> 03:41:29.567]  And the easy part of them is we'll just ban this and we'll ban that and we'll tell them they can't do this.
[03:41:29.567 --> 03:41:32.348]  That's the kind of what we'll end up with.
[03:41:32.348 --> 03:41:36.210]  And we're seeing this in countries all over the world.
[03:41:36.210 --> 03:41:40.032]  Because they control the borders they're going to decide what comes in and what comes out anyway.
[03:41:40.032 --> 03:41:41.212]  Things we can't get here on our own.
[03:41:41.212 --> 03:41:45.614]  I've always maintained from the start we do not have a health system.
[03:41:45.614 --> 03:41:47.615]  We have an illness maintenance system.
[03:41:47.615 --> 03:41:48.435]  There is no profit.
[03:41:49.522 --> 03:41:59.227]  Yeah, as we said in the last segment, now medical intervention is the leading cause of death in the world.
[03:41:59.227 --> 03:42:05.010]  And it used to be the third leading cause of death, but now it's sort of slotted up to number one.
[03:42:05.010 --> 03:42:12.893]  The more of this kind of synthetic biotechnology that comes in, the worse our health becomes.
[03:42:12.893 --> 03:42:15.635]  We have to get back to basics, really.
[03:42:15.635 --> 03:42:16.295]  Absolutely.
[03:42:16.295 --> 03:42:17.696]  And food, DNA.
[03:42:19.082 --> 03:42:20.523]  Yeah, food based on DNA.
[03:42:37.318 --> 03:42:47.006]  And actually go and have boots on the ground and talk to these people directly and tell them you do not stand by this and you want to maintain your birthright to natural remedies.
[03:42:47.006 --> 03:42:50.068]  So, Guy Hatchard, thank you so much for joining us.
[03:42:50.068 --> 03:42:53.471]  We really appreciated you being on with us for the fourth hour on the Alex Jones Show.
[03:42:57.677 --> 03:43:01.601]  Ladies and gentlemen, a very exciting development has just taken place.
[03:43:01.601 --> 03:43:10.489]  I want to encourage you all to go to InfoWareStore.com and check it out for yourself because it is a very strong, high quality formula.
[03:43:10.489 --> 03:43:15.553]  Gallon out sleep support, liquid, it's very fast acting, take it under the tongue.
[03:43:15.553 --> 03:43:17.936]  It's got a very good dose of melatonin.
[03:43:18.636 --> 03:43:23.821]  Passionflower, valerian root extract, lemon balm, and German chamomile.
[03:43:23.821 --> 03:43:30.186]  All of these compounds are documented on record to help give you deeper, cleaner, healthier sleep.
[03:43:30.186 --> 03:43:34.370]  And that is one of the biggest game changers out there with all the stress we have in this world.
[03:43:34.870 --> 03:43:38.271]  I'm Dr. Peter McCullough and it's an absolute pleasure to introduce to you The Wellness Company.
[03:44:04.136 --> 03:44:14.525]  An alternative healthcare system for this COVID and post-COVID world where trust has been lost in doctors and healthcare systems.

[03:45:04.460 --> 03:45:06.082]  We're actually winning the Info Award.
[03:45:06.082 --> 03:45:16.250]  And when you realize that Bandot Video has hundreds and hundreds of censored directors and investigative journalists and talk show hosts, whose information is beyond incredible.
[03:45:16.250 --> 03:45:21.975]  Hundreds of medical doctors and scientists, all of them, right now, telling the truth at Bandot Video.
[03:45:21.975 --> 03:45:24.197]  Millions of people a day visiting Bandot Video.
[03:45:24.517 --> 03:45:34.104]  But you can take that information and cause a bigger ripple effect, an amplifying effect, and make sure it gets out to your friends, your family, your neighbors, and perfect strangers.
[03:45:34.104 --> 03:45:36.666]  You are the modern Paul Reveres.
[03:45:36.666 --> 03:45:39.808]  You are what takes our information and amplifies it.
[03:45:39.808 --> 03:45:45.072]  When you decide to take action, we as a species and as a race are invincible.
[03:45:45.072 --> 03:45:52.478]  So I thank you all for your past action, and I challenge you to redouble your efforts now, because humanity and the children are counting on you.
[03:45:57.904 --> 03:46:07.331]  Introducing InfoWars super high-end supplement line at up to 50% off what these same formulas are sold for in stores.

[03:46:50.754 --> 03:46:53.635]  This is our new InfoWars MD Incredible line.
[03:46:59.187 --> 03:47:03.808]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[03:47:03.808 --> 03:47:13.450]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:47:13.450 --> 03:47:16.790]  And of course that was Dr. Guy Hatchard with us in the previous segment.
[03:47:16.790 --> 03:47:20.411]  You can check him out at thehatchardreport.com.
[03:47:20.411 --> 03:47:26.352]  And it just so happens that here at InfoWars you can go and get so many therapeutics and
[03:47:26.792 --> 03:47:27.012]  I think so.
[03:47:47.769 --> 03:47:55.975]  We're going to have a talk about what's really happening in this country and please sing along if you know this tune, you're probably getting it in your country as well.
[03:47:55.975 --> 03:48:01.139]  Let's look at some of the gifts that the New Zealand Government just keeps giving and brought us in 2022 and of course into 2023.
[03:48:17.792 --> 03:48:22.978]  Yes, so the first look we want to talk about is the increased gun violence.
[03:48:22.978 --> 03:48:27.662]  That should be image 9 if we got everything in line in the end.
[03:48:27.662 --> 03:48:30.946]  Because of course, after the Christchurch massacre,
[03:48:31.756 --> 03:48:34.818]  The gun laws were heavily changed, weren't they, Kelvin?
[03:48:34.818 --> 03:48:35.499]  Immediately.
[03:48:35.499 --> 03:48:39.822]  They already had them on standby, ready to go, they just needed a reason to put them in.
[03:48:39.822 --> 03:48:59.877]  And now they've got 23 drive-by shootings in just one single week, and this was actually right after Jacinda Ardern went on her global tour, and she was over in the United States, and she was on the Stephen Colbert Show, and she's actually been over there telling the US how they should manage their guns, and I'm sure many of you are very unhappy with that.
[03:49:00.217 --> 03:49:01.959]  Yeah, well, here she is.
[03:49:01.959 --> 03:49:07.263]  She comes, she decimates the gun laws here and basically does a buyback scheme.
[03:49:07.263 --> 03:49:10.726]  How you can buy something back that you never owned, who knows?
[03:49:10.726 --> 03:49:12.207]  But they did anyway.
[03:49:12.207 --> 03:49:15.790]  And as a result, increased gun crime.
[03:49:15.790 --> 03:49:21.334]  So many ram raids, so many attacks on dairy owners.
[03:49:21.334 --> 03:49:26.879]  The violence here has gone through the roof since she came in with her nice, kind gestures.
[03:49:28.220 --> 03:49:33.365]  And of course, that's basically what the Democrats have done as well, like in the democratic states, where they have high gun control laws.
[03:49:43.494 --> 03:49:47.999]  Violence and the gun criminals are through the roof.
[03:49:47.999 --> 03:49:59.470]  So it's not the good upstanding citizens that have their gun licenses that are doing these crimes, it's obviously... Well basically if a criminal believes that if he breaks into a house he's going to get shot, he'll think twice and therefore not probably not do it, unless he's certifiably mad.
[03:50:00.353 --> 03:50:04.136]  If he knows that everyone's disarmed, he's got free pickings, isn't he?
[03:50:04.136 --> 03:50:04.777]  That's right.
[03:50:04.777 --> 03:50:16.086]  And there is a mainstream story that was going around in New Zealand that the TikTok and the adrenaline rush is actually what is behind a lot of these ram raids here in New Zealand.
[03:50:16.086 --> 03:50:21.370]  It's young people, they are ramming cars into, you know, jewellery stores and other stores with high value items.
[03:50:21.850 --> 03:50:34.597]  Kind of like what we're seeing in the US where people are just, you know, these anti-far types that are just basically going into stores, taking what they want, knowing that they won't actually be, there won't be serious consequences.
[03:50:34.597 --> 03:50:43.762]  And a lot of the criminal organisations are using young people because they don't actually face criminal charges as adults, so therefore it's usually just youth court, flip on the hand and get back home.
[03:50:44.401 --> 03:50:48.884]  Yes, and of course, Kelvin, the climate change narrative is rolling out as well.
[03:50:48.884 --> 03:51:00.071]  And many of you will have heard last year here in New Zealand that the New Zealand government wants to tax farmers for the flatulence that these cows are emitting.
[03:51:00.071 --> 03:51:02.232]  And of course, it is just ridiculous.
[03:51:02.232 --> 03:51:06.175]  I think they want to reduce dairy farming by about 14 percent.
[03:51:06.175 --> 03:51:09.377]  We have Image 12 there as a headline, the CNN headline.
[03:51:09.377 --> 03:51:11.318]  Actually, that story went around the world.
[03:51:11.839 --> 03:51:16.247]  And then, of course, we've got these 20 minute cities as well, Kelvin.
[03:51:16.247 --> 03:51:17.209]  What do you want to say about that?
[03:51:18.211 --> 03:51:25.375]  Basically what's going to happen is you won't, think Hunger Games, districting, having to have permission to leave the area.
[03:51:25.375 --> 03:51:30.458]  Much like we did with the lockdowns, just to get everyone used to being partitioned off from their family and friends.
[03:51:30.458 --> 03:51:35.481]  It's just an ongoing thing, it's not about health, it's completely about control.
[03:51:35.481 --> 03:51:41.785]  InfoWars and Alex Jones have been pushing this and telling you for years what's coming, and here it is on our doorstep.
[03:51:42.205 --> 03:51:48.749]  And yet, because there's so many battlefronts, everyone are fighting different symptoms of this main disease.
[03:51:48.749 --> 03:51:50.971]  And the main disease is control of humanity.
[03:51:50.971 --> 03:51:52.712]  And transhumanism is their end goal.
[03:51:53.450 --> 03:52:18.591]  Definitely, and another way they've been doing that here in New Zealand, Kelvin, is Three Waters, where they are, here in New Zealand, we have councils which regulate local areas and local communities, and things like water and other amenities have been administered by our local councils, and now the government is nationalising that even further, and they actually want to take control of that.
[03:52:18.591 --> 03:52:21.273]  And what we're seeing also is a division here
[03:52:22.633 --> 03:52:24.014]  Based on race, Kelvin?
[03:52:24.014 --> 03:52:32.557]  It's an apartheid system where they're trying to say, okay, those that we are calling the native population, you are now going to control all aspects of water.
[03:52:32.557 --> 03:52:35.938]  It's not just three waters, there's actually five different types of waters.
[03:52:35.938 --> 03:52:40.099]  Everything from lakes, rivers, what comes out of your tap, even what falls from the sky.
[03:52:40.099 --> 03:52:40.959]  Sewage.
[03:52:40.959 --> 03:52:42.800]  Sewage, the lot.
[03:52:42.800 --> 03:52:45.821]  Only, it is not benefiting the average Maldi over here.
[03:52:46.633 --> 03:52:47.013]  At all.
[03:52:47.013 --> 03:52:48.474]  It's only the iwis.
[03:52:48.474 --> 03:52:55.396]  The iwi elite, which is corporate bodies, which is a crown entity anyway in anything but name only.
[03:52:55.396 --> 03:53:12.261]  And of course that also ties back to the UN with the Indigenous Peoples Act and the legislation around that where they are literally here in New Zealand dividing our country again on race based on the Treaty of Waitangi Act 1972.
[03:53:12.261 --> 03:53:13.662]  Because if they can divide us,
[03:53:14.383 --> 03:53:16.945]  The World Treaty Awareness Act 1975.
[03:53:16.945 --> 03:53:21.188]  It basically was a fraud, an absolute fraud.
[03:53:21.188 --> 03:53:24.610]  We forensically approved it on the Counterspin episode.
[03:53:24.610 --> 03:53:30.494]  But the government doesn't like to acknowledge that because they have an agenda, they have their foot on the gas, they're not taking it off for anyone.
[03:53:30.494 --> 03:53:35.497]  All the submissions, all the phone calls, all the protests, no matter what you do, it is coming anyway.
[03:53:35.497 --> 03:53:38.159]  There has to be another way around it and we've been saying
[03:53:38.979 --> 03:53:40.120]  Do your own.
[03:53:40.120 --> 03:53:46.983]  As Guy said, get back to basics, get back to local community, get back to that strong family because that is what they want to eviscerate.
[03:53:46.983 --> 03:53:47.864]  That's right.
[03:53:47.864 --> 03:53:54.848]  And of course, internationally, the World Economic Forum Davos meetings are happening next week.
[03:53:55.368 --> 03:54:02.372]  And you can go and check out their website there and actually go online and watch their streaming coverage.
[03:54:02.372 --> 03:54:09.537]  Now it is really important that people all around the world start watching this and waking themselves up to what is getting rolled out.
[03:54:09.537 --> 03:54:13.439]  Because as you all know, problem, reaction, solution.
[03:54:13.439 --> 03:54:14.160]  These people
[03:54:14.760 --> 03:54:15.281]  We're good.
[03:54:33.277 --> 03:54:33.718]  We're good to go.
[03:54:53.809 --> 03:54:54.369]  Your lands.
[03:54:54.369 --> 03:54:55.811]  I mean, the 1080 dropped.
[03:54:55.811 --> 03:54:57.852]  Banned in most countries but dropped here.
[03:54:57.852 --> 03:55:00.794]  Love to poison the food chain because where does that end up?
[03:55:00.794 --> 03:55:02.435]  Into the animals and into you.
[03:55:02.435 --> 03:55:04.857]  It's just a constant attack on your body.
[03:55:04.857 --> 03:55:07.059]  Well, and that's another thing with the guns, Karen.
[03:55:07.059 --> 03:55:15.745]  They don't want hunters to be able to go out into the land and actually, you know, go and find some deer or some goat here in New Zealand.
[03:55:15.745 --> 03:55:21.830]  So they are poisoning this country, killing off the bird life, all because they're saying they want to control possums.
[03:55:22.550 --> 03:55:27.315]  And again, little old New Zealand, a backwater where a lot of these policies are tested.
[03:55:27.315 --> 03:55:30.137]  We are the lab rates of the world many times.
[03:55:30.137 --> 03:55:35.602]  And we have to also... With our cousins across the ditch Australia, of course, they had some of the worst lockdowns.
[03:55:35.602 --> 03:55:37.384]  We possibly had the second worst.
[03:55:38.004 --> 03:55:41.805]  Because we have always been tested on, and if we buy it, they farm it out for the rest of the world.
[03:55:41.805 --> 03:55:47.066]  So sorry guys, it's actually our fault you guys are getting such tyranny laid at your feet.
[03:55:47.066 --> 03:55:50.947]  Over here as well, there's been an attack on our energy independence.
[03:55:50.947 --> 03:55:53.367]  Like in the US, funny that, again, if I said a few.
[03:55:53.367 --> 03:55:58.268]  Notice June saying along, with the Marsden Point shutdown, our only oil refinery.
[03:55:58.268 --> 03:56:02.809]  We have enough oil in our Great South Basin alone to be energy independent for centuries.
[03:56:03.450 --> 03:56:04.111]  We're good to go.
[03:56:14.622 --> 03:56:15.663]  On the Earth next to water.
[03:56:15.663 --> 03:56:17.726]  It's most prevalent next to water.
[03:56:17.726 --> 03:56:18.787]  And the Earth generates it.
[03:56:18.787 --> 03:56:19.648]  So it's not a scarcity.
[03:56:19.648 --> 03:56:20.389]  There's no people.
[03:56:20.389 --> 03:56:21.270]  It's not going to run out.
[03:56:21.270 --> 03:56:23.613]  It's a fabricated lie.
[03:56:23.613 --> 03:56:30.541]  So if you want to check out more on that information over here on the Marsden attack, go look at digging at Marsden and of course Operation Good Oil.
[03:56:30.541 --> 03:56:34.186]  Both of those groups doing amazing jobs at bringing that subject to life here.
[03:56:34.566 --> 03:56:39.410]  And now, but just before we wrap it up, we want to bring your attention to this New Dawn magazine.
[03:56:39.410 --> 03:56:51.498]  It is actually an Australian publication, and that was censored last week off the shelves here in New Zealand, all because they told the story of the strange story of Brenton Tarrant.
[03:56:51.498 --> 03:56:54.160]  And he, of course, is the Christchurch shooter.
[03:56:54.160 --> 03:56:55.841]  He is in jail.
[03:56:55.841 --> 03:57:02.906]  Spoiler, there's three Brenton Tarrants, and the one they've got inside at the moment, who pleaded guilty, who is now challenging that guilty
[03:57:03.678 --> 03:57:06.906]  Leave because they tortured and coerced him, he says.
[03:57:06.906 --> 03:57:08.590]  He's got the IQ of a rock.
[03:57:08.590 --> 03:57:10.254]  Yes.
[03:57:10.254 --> 03:57:12.479]  Christchurch was New Zealand's Port Arthur massacre.
[03:57:13.375 --> 03:57:26.187]  So that that is showing you that Whitco is one of our biggest stationary shops has taken that off the shelves But you guys have a right to know the information so and you'll have to find it elsewhere now you may notice This is a new jacket.
[03:57:26.187 --> 03:57:35.997]  I'm wearing and I just wanted to give a massive shout out to lonely lingerie Earth they are an amazing company actually that was very loved by a lot of Hollywood and
[03:57:36.597 --> 03:57:36.938]  Thank you.
[03:57:47.142 --> 03:57:48.784]  You want to beat the New World Order?
[03:57:48.784 --> 03:57:50.626]  You want to stop their globalist agenda?
[03:57:50.626 --> 03:57:58.155]  Well, so do I. And I've been the most effective individual in the fight against the globalists, and I've got their number, and I know how to bring them down.
[03:57:58.155 --> 03:58:02.861]  But ladies and gentlemen, I can't do it without your support.
[03:58:02.861 --> 03:58:05.544]  And the good news is, we're only under about $200,000 a month.
[03:58:07.406 --> 03:58:12.069]  The bad news is the enemy is intensifying their attacks on every front, but I'm not going to back down.
[03:58:12.069 --> 03:58:14.091]  And I'll never give up, but I could give out.
[03:58:14.091 --> 03:58:15.912]  So please, keep me on the field.
[03:58:15.912 --> 03:58:21.115]  Keep me on the front lines against the enemy, while getting great products at the same time that will empower you and your family.

[03:58:32.583 --> 03:58:34.064]  But I thank you all for your support.
[03:58:34.064 --> 03:58:38.486]  Please commit now to go to InfoWareStore.com and get great products and make donations.
[03:58:38.486 --> 03:58:39.467]  I thank you for your support.
[03:58:39.467 --> 03:58:40.667]  Now take action!
[03:58:40.667 --> 03:58:43.409]  The globalists are counting on you not taking action!
[03:58:47.009 --> 03:58:58.314]  Once a tragedy reaches a level of national significance, American citizens should be allowed to basically question that event in any way that they deem fit.
[03:58:58.314 --> 03:59:00.215]  The First Amendment is unique in the world.
[03:59:00.215 --> 03:59:01.675]  That's what they want to take away.
[03:59:01.675 --> 03:59:03.196]  Your ability to speak freely.
[03:59:03.196 --> 03:59:04.897]  So they're going to go for Mike Lindell next?
[03:59:04.897 --> 03:59:06.177]  Or are they going to go for Steve Bannon?
[03:59:06.177 --> 03:59:07.578]  Or are they going to go for Tucker Carlson?
[03:59:07.998 --> 03:59:12.842]  I studied The Globalist 30 years ago, but only 28 years, and I knew they were planning all of this.
[03:59:12.842 --> 03:59:15.225]  And I warned the public, as the modern Paul Revere.
[03:59:15.225 --> 03:59:17.246]  But I couldn't have done it without your support.
[03:59:17.246 --> 03:59:24.193]  And now, because we've been so successful warning the population of the planet, not just America, we're public enemy number one when it comes to The Globalist agenda.
[03:59:24.833 --> 03:59:30.217]  That's why it's more important than ever to realize how successful InfoWars has been because of your past support.
[03:59:30.217 --> 03:59:39.163]  So I salute you and I thank you and I ask you now, at the critical juncture of the battle, to redouble your efforts by visiting InfoWarsTore.com and getting amazing products that keep us on air.
[03:59:39.163 --> 03:59:45.448]  1776 is the promo code, the destination is InfoWarsTore.com and I thank you all for your support.
[03:59:50.447 --> 03:59:54.382]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
