[02:19.520 --> 02:28.640]  course dealing with nine eleven the british government and the u.s. government
[02:28.640 --> 02:32.840]  as well as the australian government are admitting that airport body scanners do
[02:32.840 --> 02:38.560]  strip search and that the genitals must be completely clear if the scan is to be
[02:38.560 --> 02:44.200]  effective now we've been telling you this all along national television blurs
[02:44.200 --> 02:49.840]  it out but if you go to the actual industry websites of the difference
[02:49.840 --> 02:55.040]  security firms and others selling these systems and building them it is crisp it
[02:55.040 --> 02:59.920]  is clear but national television obviously is too squeamish to show you
[02:59.920 --> 03:05.760]  what's actually actually happening we have an article up on prison planet dot
[03:05.760 --> 03:12.080]  com written by pole watson today where we flipped one of the body scan images
[03:12.080 --> 03:16.440]  and you can see once you reverse the negative that it shows it in crisp
[03:16.440 --> 03:22.000]  living color the naked body of course they have different settings on the
[03:22.000 --> 03:26.640]  machines to see you in a pink light a red light a orange light a gray light a
[03:26.640 --> 03:33.760]  negative light of the inverse image and these are high quality digital body
[03:33.760 --> 03:39.840]  scans what you see on the news is not the 360 body scan they shoot but only one
[03:39.840 --> 03:45.880]  still shot one frame from the recording so we're gonna be breaking that down
[03:45.880 --> 03:58.680]  today there is a report that I have here from raw story and it links to a

[08:20.360 --> 08:23.960]  alex jones
[08:31.440 --> 08:36.520]  shock study put out by the federal government it's far worse than this
[08:36.520 --> 08:45.320]  12% of kids abused in government custody I was in jail one time when I was a
[08:45.320 --> 08:50.280]  juvenile because big redneck started a fight with me and started beat me up
[08:50.280 --> 08:56.760]  pretty bad so I opened up a can of caveman kick butt on him and put him
[08:56.760 --> 09:06.200]  in a coma and they said it doesn't matter of witnesses report that he
[09:06.200 --> 09:12.080]  attacked you you are going to jail and they tried to charge me and brought it
[09:12.080 --> 09:15.360]  into court and I was in jail for about five days until I got thrown out in
[09:15.360 --> 09:20.440]  court when we brought forward the witnesses that he attacked me and then
[09:20.440 --> 09:28.600]  I only punched him a few times but while I was in juvenile custody in
[09:28.600 --> 09:37.560]  terrell texas the jail guard took me into the showers I wasn't allowed out for a
[09:37.560 --> 09:41.320]  few days and he said now it's time for your shower and I said funny everybody
[09:41.320 --> 09:45.520]  goes at a certain time for showers said well we're taking a shower he said take
[09:45.520 --> 09:50.040]  your clothes off I'm gonna enjoy myself with you and I said number one I'm gonna
[09:50.040 --> 09:55.000]  resist you and I said number two my dad's gonna come after you and he said
[09:55.000 --> 10:02.000]  okay and grabbed me and talked me down the hall and shoved me into the jail
[10:02.000 --> 10:07.800]  cell that I didn't get food for a day and a half but thank God then I got out
[10:07.800 --> 10:14.880]  that's my one experience in a juvenile detention center on top of the courthouse
[10:14.880 --> 10:20.520]  in terrell texas it took me from rock wall to terrell for some reason 25 miles
[10:20.520 --> 10:30.760]  away outside Dallas I've been in juvenile one time oh that's not true one time I
[10:30.760 --> 10:34.560]  just pulled up at a bonfire I was 16 right before we moved down here by the
[10:34.560 --> 10:38.440]  lake and the police just pulled up and randomly arrested 30 40 people I hadn't
[10:38.440 --> 10:44.320]  even gotten a beer yet and took us all in for a minor in possession but I was in
[10:44.320 --> 10:48.000]  the jail that time about an hour and a half they just called my daddy came and
[10:48.000 --> 10:51.120]  got me and they later dropped it because it was clear I hadn't been drinking
[10:51.120 --> 10:54.240]  they just randomly a bunch of cop cars pulled up and said everybody over there
[10:54.240 --> 10:59.200]  you're going to jail so I got net that's right I've been in there twice but
[10:59.200 --> 11:06.200]  then I was in the drunk tank at 16 with the adults so that wasn't juvenile so
[11:06.200 --> 11:11.600]  guess that is accurate I've been in juvenile one time and then jail wants
[11:11.600 --> 11:17.360]  for the beer when I was 16 even though I didn't have any beer I was there at the
[11:17.360 --> 11:24.280]  bonfire hoping to get my hands on some but yes the great crime of teenagers out
[11:24.280 --> 11:31.840]  by the lake drinking beer but I mean I have been in juvenile one time and the
[11:31.840 --> 11:37.360]  jail guard tried to rape me that's America where do you think pedophiles go
[11:37.360 --> 11:48.040]  to get jobs TSA truancy officers and juvenile jail guards and that guy
[11:48.040 --> 11:52.480]  clearly tried to have sex with me the night before I was released a more
[11:52.480 --> 11:57.600]  Nelly type guard came and got me out and said sorry about what happened the other
[11:57.600 --> 12:01.520]  day come upstairs with me and I want to show you around and they took me up to
[12:01.520 --> 12:06.600]  another floor where they had the washing machines and he then told me I was
[12:06.600 --> 12:14.760]  handsome but I didn't show any any proclivity towards the same sex might
[12:14.760 --> 12:19.640]  have been a problem it was a good-looking female guard and I was pretty
[12:19.640 --> 12:27.720]  rascally at that time I think I was 14 when I yeah when I when I knocked that
[12:27.720 --> 12:35.480]  guy out for two weeks he did come out of it two weeks later and so but but but
[12:35.480 --> 12:41.320]  that wasn't I'm going to rape you now that was just boy you're handsome now
[12:41.320 --> 12:47.440]  ladies and gentlemen that's America and so you need to know when your children
[12:47.440 --> 12:55.040]  are visited by CPS or when your child is put in jail I'd have to say half of
[12:55.040 --> 12:59.040]  them are pedophiles and of course it came out what three years ago and the
[12:59.040 --> 13:03.000]  nothing was done the Texas Rangers discovered that every juvenile justice
[13:03.000 --> 13:11.280]  prison in Texas is pale male raping the children videotaping it locals pull up
[13:11.280 --> 13:19.680]  and go in and pay for sex with people as young as 10 the state police tried to
[13:19.680 --> 13:23.320]  stop it so they kicked the state police director out last year because he
[13:23.320 --> 13:27.000]  refused to drop the case that's the real reason the head of the DPS was forced
[13:27.000 --> 13:34.960]  to step down not the botched handling of the staged firebombing of the governor's
[13:34.960 --> 13:40.440]  mansion but don't believe me I mean here's the feds own study this is a raw
[13:40.440 --> 13:47.760]  story shock study 12% of kids sexually abused in government custody some 12
[13:47.760 --> 13:54.520]  percent of minors held in government custody are sexually abused and in some
[13:54.520 --> 14:00.360]  facilities the rate reaches a stunning one in three children says a report
[14:00.360 --> 14:04.840]  released Thursday by the Bureau of Justice statistics that's federal
[14:04.840 --> 14:12.840]  government 12% yet rate that's the 12% that are attractive to them I've had
[14:12.840 --> 14:18.840]  state senators on the confirmed bounty CPS gets bounties from these so-called
[14:18.840 --> 14:23.440]  adoption agencies for rich people and they'll say I want a two-year-old
[14:23.440 --> 14:30.160]  brunette with blue eyes girl I want a three-year-old blonde boy I'll pay
[14:30.160 --> 14:37.160]  $500,000 if they've got a beauty mark and the CPS this is on record in
[14:37.160 --> 14:41.440]  mainstream news puts out a bounty then they've got operatives and all the
[14:41.440 --> 14:46.280]  public schools and elementaries and daycare centers government affiliated
[14:46.280 --> 14:50.880]  daycare centers with head start and then they just go in and grab that grab that
[14:50.880 --> 14:57.360]  child and it's gone you got a blonde-haired blue-eyed child particularly
[14:57.360 --> 15:01.120]  that's their favorite you got a really look out ladies and gentlemen you see
[15:01.120 --> 15:07.480]  this is what really runs America a guild of hardcore child rapist I know that's
[15:07.480 --> 15:11.440]  hard to believe but you ladies and gentlemen I've studied it that's who
[15:11.440 --> 15:16.200]  runs America who will do whatever they're told and commit whatever crimes
[15:16.200 --> 15:19.080]  they're told who could grab kids from screaming families with no evidence of
[15:19.080 --> 15:24.360]  abuse pedophiles now the big adoption agencies and others and the private
[15:24.360 --> 15:28.240]  agencies that run all this I've seen the statistics in Texas that you know some
[15:28.240 --> 15:35.040]  of the heads of these private groups make 10 15 20 million a year personally the
[15:35.040 --> 15:38.960]  first-ever national survey of youth and custody that's not true it's not the
[15:38.960 --> 15:46.040]  first ever it is not the first ever I remembered in 2000 the cover of news
[15:46.040 --> 15:50.200]  week saying the shame of foster care five times more likely to be abused
[15:50.200 --> 15:55.480]  federal statistics in government care than any other group see no one abuses
[15:55.480 --> 16:02.440]  children more 3400 plus missing in Florida remember that five years ago the
[16:02.440 --> 16:06.960]  few they found had that were beheaded in shallow graves flown out to countries
[16:06.960 --> 16:13.680]  like Saudi Arabia they'd fire one director of CPS for being a convicted
[16:13.680 --> 16:17.360]  pedophile the next guy'd be a convicted pedophile the next guy'd be a convicted
[16:17.360 --> 16:21.200]  pedophile how many Homeland Security directors at the state level have been
[16:21.200 --> 16:25.720]  caught flying with little kids they grabbed from foster care to rape areas
[16:25.720 --> 16:31.520]  or or trying to meet with kids this is your government a bunch of pedophiles
[16:31.520 --> 16:36.240]  of course they want a naked body scan your children what do you think this is
[16:36.240 --> 16:40.640]  all about ladies and gentlemen are you ready to face the full magnitude of the
[16:40.640 --> 16:47.920]  evil we're under no you're not ready I saw a national survey today in fact guys
[16:47.920 --> 16:54.320]  I aimed it to you or I may just send it to Watson just just just Google new
[16:54.320 --> 16:57.800]  national survey parents believe their kids aren't on the internet that was one
[16:57.800 --> 17:01.360]  of the headlines and it had like 80 some percent believe their kids aren't on the
[17:01.360 --> 17:06.160]  internet or never use drugs or aren't sexually promiscuous see the parents are
[17:06.160 --> 17:10.400]  all in denial we're a nation in denial and that's why the kids can run
[17:10.400 --> 17:15.400]  wild the government can run wild criminals can run wild because people are
[17:15.400 --> 17:21.400]  in denial let me give you the parents news flashes 80 plus percent of your
[17:21.400 --> 17:27.200]  teenagers are not sexually active you you really believe that how about 80% are
[17:27.200 --> 17:32.000]  sexually active you believe that the majority of your children are never on
[17:32.000 --> 17:34.920]  the internet or are barely on the internet you're living in a wonderland
[17:34.920 --> 17:38.720]  you believe the majority of your children haven't used drugs by the time
[17:38.720 --> 17:47.000]  they're 18 what what planet are you living on I didn't know any jocks in
[17:47.000 --> 17:51.560]  high school or college who hadn't tried drugs once or twice now most of them
[17:51.560 --> 17:57.120]  have tried them and then didn't like them like myself but almost everybody I'd
[17:57.120 --> 18:01.560]  say 98% have tried at least marijuana
[18:01.560 --> 18:09.800]  I'll tell you that bookworms and jocks don't have a proclivity towards cocaine
[18:09.800 --> 18:13.720]  and heroin most of them do try hallucinogens at least once I know
[18:13.720 --> 18:20.080]  because I had friends in high school and college I know we all know but no the
[18:20.080 --> 18:24.600]  parents believe that their kids never even tried drugs anyway side issue show
[18:24.600 --> 18:29.600]  how can they believe then that if your kid gets in a fight now even if nobody
[18:29.600 --> 18:34.600]  gets hurt everybody goes to jail and when you're 12 13 or 14 year old ends up
[18:34.600 --> 18:41.640]  in juvie there's going to be a big pot belly Nelly pedophile rare into go who
[18:41.640 --> 18:49.400]  can't wait to get your kid in there and pop them full of AIDS shock study 12% of
[18:49.400 --> 18:54.920]  kids sexually abused in government custody the first ever national survey
[18:54.920 --> 18:59.840]  of youth in custody not true found that no less than 10% of the 26,550
[18:59.840 --> 19:03.160]  juveniles being held in detention facilities in the US that was just a
[19:03.160 --> 19:07.160]  sample are abused by a staff at the facility while another 2.6% report
[19:07.160 --> 19:13.840]  abuse at the hands of other inmates so so so you get 10% of them are getting

[24:21.480 --> 24:26.040]  of their own kids behavior the vast majority don't believe that their
[24:26.040 --> 24:33.560]  children up to age 17 are having sex completely delusional the vast majority
[24:33.560 --> 24:38.720]  don't think their children up to age 17 have even tried drugs totally delusional
[24:38.720 --> 24:47.800]  and of course the average American doesn't know that juvenile justice halls
[24:47.800 --> 24:54.520]  are the equivalent of Abu Ghraib Saddam Hussein rape rooms but that's the
[24:54.520 --> 25:03.440]  federal government's Justice Department owned study 12% getting raped and of
[25:03.440 --> 25:14.960]  the 12 plus percent what's 12 point 12.6 of the 12.6 getting raped 10 plus
[25:14.960 --> 25:18.920]  percent of that is the jailguards
[25:22.720 --> 25:28.080]  so if 12 plus percent are getting sexually abused of the 12 plus percent
[25:28.080 --> 25:35.240]  10 plus percent or 80 plus percent of the raping is being done by the government
[25:35.240 --> 25:43.360]  you better stop living in denial about crime and about degeneracy and about just
[25:43.360 --> 25:50.800]  how sick this society is we are a very sick society and we have to admit I mean
[25:50.800 --> 25:53.760]  what does the Bible say it's common sense do one to others as you have them do
[25:53.760 --> 25:56.160]  under you
[26:01.640 --> 26:07.120]  I mean look at what we've done we've killed 50 plus million babies since 1973
[26:07.120 --> 26:12.480]  with Roe v Wade and we say they're not humans that's denial that's living in
[26:12.480 --> 26:17.240]  denial so of course foreign banks are gonna rob you and steal all your pension
[26:17.240 --> 26:20.080]  funds and bankrupt the government of course they're gonna put army on the
[26:20.080 --> 26:24.000]  streets of course they're gonna put naked body scanners in the airports of
[26:24.000 --> 26:28.560]  course TSA people are gonna go insane and start screaming I'm God I'm God I
[26:28.560 --> 26:32.640]  rule everyone running around insanely door they have to be arrested that
[26:32.640 --> 26:40.440]  happened yesterday at LAX that's NBC news this is what happens when you let
[26:40.440 --> 26:45.320]  crazy control freaks get in control some of them are sadistic psychopaths some
[26:45.320 --> 26:48.320]  of them are pedophiles some of them are control freaks some of them are just
[26:48.320 --> 26:52.280]  greedy people that want a bunch of money and they will rob you they will take
[26:52.280 --> 26:57.160]  over your life they will use excuses of terrorism and environmental crises and
[26:57.160 --> 27:04.080]  the flu to force things on you it's all a scam
[27:05.320 --> 27:09.440]  I keep seeing reports out of England and Canada where the government that we've
[27:09.440 --> 27:12.960]  had government officials on pushing in here on this show for everyone to be
[27:12.960 --> 27:18.120]  rationed for their carbon footprint that everyone only be allowed to buy so much
[27:18.120 --> 27:29.440]  food that's BBC today should we bring back rationing for the environment they
[27:29.440 --> 27:33.440]  want you to be a complete prisoner don't you understand we have a completely
[27:33.440 --> 27:38.440]  rogue global government using psych warfare techniques to screw up our
[27:38.440 --> 27:42.760]  society and it's time for good citizens good people in government out of
[27:42.760 --> 27:49.240]  government good police good military we are the majority not everyone is evil
[27:49.240 --> 27:54.520]  but you probably got 25 30% of the public that are as evil as it gets
[27:54.520 --> 28:03.200]  there is evil as old scratch they might as well be wearing red pajamas and
[28:03.200 --> 28:08.640]  running around with pitchforks and we've got to protect ourselves from them
[28:08.640 --> 28:13.360]  history the number one most dangerous abusive thing the most murderous thing
[28:13.360 --> 28:18.760]  the most abusive thing the most evil thing is government because it's the
[28:18.760 --> 28:23.720]  only thing big enough and powerful enough to really hurt people in mass you
[28:23.720 --> 28:28.040]  can get loan nuts out there and loan criminals but they always end up getting
[28:28.040 --> 28:32.840]  caught may not be the first time or the 20th time they do something evil but
[28:32.840 --> 28:37.760]  they finally get caught where can you engage in corruption and evil and
[28:37.760 --> 28:43.280]  theft and get away with it the longest government where does smart criminals go
[28:43.280 --> 28:50.240]  government and now corporations of the 100 biggest economies 50 plus last time

[29:19.480 --> 29:23.960]  issue of New Yorker magazine bragging about what I already knew but to see them
[29:23.960 --> 29:28.560]  admit it that the beers that owns the world diamond monopoly has giant armies
[29:28.560 --> 29:33.200]  of private troops thousands of troops they send in the slaughter whoever they

[33:20.080 --> 33:24.520]  for the latest incident it was this past Sunday night here at LAX about 7.30
[33:24.520 --> 33:27.760]  probably crowded because a lot of people were coming home from the New Year's
[33:27.760 --> 33:32.160]  holiday when suddenly a man starts acting strangely he starts saying I'm God
[33:32.160 --> 33:39.960]  I'm in charge LAX police and arrest that man and he turns out to be a TSA agent
[33:39.960 --> 33:44.040]  they are the first line of defense in airport security transportation
[33:44.040 --> 33:47.920]  security administration agents but there have been two troubling incidents
[33:47.920 --> 33:53.640]  involving LAX TSA agents recently a source tells Channel 4 news a TSA agent
[33:53.640 --> 33:58.800]  was arrested on January 3rd here at Terminal 1 at LAX he just gotten off
[33:58.800 --> 34:04.600]  duty and was behaving erratically saying I am God I'm in charge the agent was
[34:04.600 --> 34:07.920]  arrested under the welfare code and could have been hospitalized in
[34:07.920 --> 34:12.960]  protective custody for up to 72 hours meanwhile a TSA internal affairs
[34:12.960 --> 34:18.080]  investigation turned up evidence of LAX TSA agents using drugs at an
[34:18.080 --> 34:22.680]  after-hours party TSA officials say a videotape of the party was of poor
[34:22.680 --> 34:28.000]  quality and the employees were not in uniform but four employees were tentatively
[34:28.000 --> 34:33.440]  identified all four were tested for drugs one came back positive and that
[34:33.440 --> 34:38.160]  employee was fired there shouldn't be people under the influence because you're
[34:38.160 --> 34:41.480]  still under the influence the next day they're gonna take a job here you take
[34:41.480 --> 34:44.600]  on an extra responsibility you need to follow through with your responsibilities
[34:44.600 --> 34:48.200]  even on your own time but other passengers weren't as concerned I
[34:48.200 --> 34:51.920]  imagine there are a lot of people doing that and all walks of life doing all
[34:51.920 --> 34:58.200]  kinds of work so here they are setting the precedent that it's okay they're
[34:58.200 --> 35:01.160]  running around saying they're God flipping out going crazy on power
[35:01.160 --> 35:06.760]  trips now I've flown through LAX a few times and had TSA say they're fans of
[35:06.760 --> 35:14.240]  the show but also what was it two years ago I'm walking through I just taken a
[35:14.240 --> 35:20.920]  shower at the hotel before I left I was dressed nice I changed my socks twice a
[35:20.920 --> 35:29.040]  day the point is my feet do not stink and they I took my shoes off and they
[35:29.040 --> 35:32.200]  told me come up where they were gonna want me and they sat me down and started
[35:32.200 --> 35:37.520]  wanting me and they said ooh stinky feet your feet stink and I looked at the two
[35:37.520 --> 35:44.720]  TSA guys and they started laughing at me and it's a imagine of it if I was a
[35:44.720 --> 35:48.520]  black guy that happened what have been calls of racism because they were two
[35:48.520 --> 35:53.640]  black TSA agents two large black men who were doing this laughing at me and and I
[35:53.640 --> 35:57.160]  said you know that's not very funny and they said oh you got a problem just get
[35:57.160 --> 36:01.400]  your shoes on and get out of here and there's all the confirmed reports of the
[36:01.400 --> 36:05.920]  TSA groping women's breast and making people strip search take their shirts
[36:05.920 --> 36:12.480]  off in front of people right after 9 11 they had something called Wolverine
[36:12.480 --> 36:16.080]  security in the San Francisco airport when I was flying out they were checking
[36:16.080 --> 36:19.960]  people not just at the checkpoint the security checkpoint but at the at the
[36:19.960 --> 36:26.960]  actual boarding area when you show your your ticket to go on the plane walking
[36:26.960 --> 36:32.800]  around in bright blue uniforms with black berets with their pants tucked into
[36:32.800 --> 36:37.960]  combat boots and I'm not kidding I'll never forget it and Colonel Robert says
[36:37.960 --> 36:41.240]  he's seen something similar and actually went over and said something but I
[36:41.240 --> 36:46.280]  didn't say anything they had this this group of old men and women one of them
[36:46.280 --> 36:49.640]  had an oxygen tank and you've seen old people and they looked they're about to
[36:49.640 --> 36:54.720]  die and the and and their eyelids don't go up to their eyes anymore they peel
[36:54.720 --> 36:58.920]  down you see the red flesh of their eyes they were telling this old man to get up
[36:58.920 --> 37:02.480]  out of his wheelchair and an oxygen tank and his his wife who looked like she was
[37:02.480 --> 37:05.720]  like five years younger very elderly herself was trying to help him and he
[37:05.720 --> 37:09.080]  had hearing aids and this guy didn't even really speak English he was going
[37:09.080 --> 37:17.360]  like he was like Filipino or something and and and the man was saying I can't
[37:17.360 --> 37:21.720]  hear you and they were poking him in the arm jabbering at him and just the image
[37:21.720 --> 37:26.120]  began then I went over and found out they were all all the vets were wearing you
[37:26.120 --> 37:31.880]  know their old military hats and they were all survivors this particular group
[37:31.880 --> 37:37.760]  of the Arizona believe it was the Arizona you know the battleship to blew up and
[37:37.760 --> 37:42.600]  sank it was a group of them going to a Pearl Harbor remembrance flying out of
[37:42.600 --> 37:48.360]  San Francisco and the image of foreigners in bizarre paramilitary outfits
[37:48.360 --> 37:53.520]  going you know jabbering at them in a foreign language gibbering at them and
[37:53.520 --> 37:58.840]  for some reason they always seem to go after old people in wheelchairs I don't
[37:58.840 --> 38:04.120]  I guess it's a wolf-like predator instinct you wolves always go for an
[38:04.120 --> 38:08.440]  older young or hurt animal so at an instinctive primitive level they always
[38:08.440 --> 38:13.920]  alert on old people or hot women and I know you've all seen it as well it's
[38:13.920 --> 38:19.640]  been in the news this happens and I only saw private security at airports a few
[38:19.640 --> 38:25.680]  other times but Wolverine security I believe was the name that's like seven
[38:25.680 --> 38:29.960]  plus years ago now but I'll never forget they kind of had Cobra commander type
[38:29.960 --> 38:35.760]  outfits remember the 1980s cartoon bright kind of brilliant not light blue but
[38:35.760 --> 38:42.240]  almost dark blue in between really with black berets and black boots stomping
[38:42.240 --> 38:48.360]  around gibbering at people and this is all about breaking our will all about
[38:48.360 --> 38:56.840]  training us to accept tyranny now there are several big articles at info wars
[38:56.840 --> 39:03.280]  dot com in the naked body scanner archive there's a big banner right in the
[39:03.280 --> 39:08.400]  middle of info wars dot com that leads you to the scores of stories we've
[39:08.400 --> 39:12.640]  written about this detailing every facet of this takeover and why I believe
[39:12.640 --> 39:15.920]  it's so important at info wars dot com but these new stories that came out
[39:15.920 --> 39:20.560]  today won't be in that archive yet they're at prison planet dot com now
[39:20.560 --> 39:27.960]  mobile devices will scan your naked body on the streets airport tyranny comes to
[39:27.960 --> 39:33.160]  your door as predicted well that's nice of you Paul to say I predicted it I
[39:33.160 --> 39:38.360]  really didn't predict it five years ago I saw mainline British newspaper
[39:38.360 --> 39:45.080]  articles about in London and several other major cities mobile vans driving
[39:45.080 --> 39:48.680]  around and it said they just randomly pull up at bars everyone's guilty no
[39:48.680 --> 39:53.720]  one's innocent no due process you're presumed guilty and then you're marched
[39:53.720 --> 39:59.680]  through looking for guns and knives the name of stopping knife crime and they
[39:59.680 --> 40:03.280]  randomly walk up to people and tourists and ask them are you a terrorist it
[40:03.280 --> 40:06.560]  happened to me and put you in a database has happened to Steve Watson who lives in
[40:06.560 --> 40:13.680]  London now I had seen homeland security three years ago talking about buying the
[40:13.680 --> 40:19.040]  same mobile vans for Boston New York Houston Los Angeles Chicago and a few
[40:19.040 --> 40:25.520]  other cities and yes they've now announced the naked body scanners will be
[40:25.520 --> 40:30.440]  used and they will go into public schools and they will go into shopping
[40:30.440 --> 40:36.640]  malls and in things like Mall of America and Disney World Disneyland and of
[40:36.640 --> 40:39.920]  course they're talking about doing it at places like SeaWorld they will be
[40:39.920 --> 40:44.760]  everywhere and they're gonna have hardened checkpoints they already have
[40:44.760 --> 40:48.640]  them in the air as the country deep inside the nation and you will be shunted
[40:48.640 --> 40:53.760]  off your car will be scanned in some cases this is in the news with you in
[40:53.760 --> 40:59.640]  it high-powered x-rays blasting you in the car there they always say it's an
[40:59.640 --> 41:03.080]  accident oh we we waved them in and didn't tell them to get out and hit them
[41:03.080 --> 41:07.640]  with systems many times more powerful than a chest x-ray I mean this shoots
[41:07.640 --> 41:11.160]  through aluminum and steel and then they will also put you in the body
[41:11.160 --> 41:14.600]  scanners we have links in the article Paul Watson wrote to all the mainstream
[41:14.600 --> 41:19.240]  media reports about that the Australian British and US governments also in
[41:19.240 --> 41:23.560]  their internal security manuals on the naked body scanners put out by multiple
[41:23.560 --> 41:27.280]  companies two major ones selling the systems in the US but there's more than
[41:27.280 --> 41:33.320]  seven we've identified and they say yes the the key the TSA is trained to look
[41:33.320 --> 41:40.000]  at the genitals and in the training manuals if they cannot see the folds of
[41:40.000 --> 41:46.440]  the woman's genitals and if they cannot clearly identify the circumcision or the
[41:46.440 --> 41:53.280]  other characteristics of the of the male testicles and member and I'm sorry to
[41:53.280 --> 41:56.400]  talk about this on air but this is this is America this is Australia this is
[41:56.400 --> 42:01.640]  Europe this is the new order and so in the training manual the genital is what
[42:01.640 --> 42:07.440]  is checked first as something that has some curves that they can test so they're
[42:07.440 --> 42:13.120]  looking first to make sure that the scan is operating at full intensity they look
[42:13.120 --> 42:19.720]  at the genitals first that says the genitals must be identified the the
[42:19.720 --> 42:24.520]  Daily Mail reports this the BBC reports this admitted airport body scanners
[42:24.520 --> 42:29.680]  provide Chris images of your genitalia prisonplanet.com has the key boil down
[42:29.680 --> 42:35.680]  article as part of the gargantuan fraud being peddled by corporate media in
[42:35.680 --> 42:39.280]  service of the government's agenda to subject everyone to degrading naked
[42:39.280 --> 42:43.160]  body scans and airports apologists for devices claim the people genitals will be
[42:43.160 --> 42:46.840]  blurred out to save embarrassment this has now been proven to be fraudulent
[42:46.840 --> 42:51.480]  con designed to keep people in the dark about the fact that the body scanners do
[42:51.480 --> 42:55.760]  produce Chris images of your naked body and they do allow TSA thugs to see
[42:55.760 --> 43:00.920]  intricate details of your genitals a report from October 2008 when the naked
[43:00.920 --> 43:03.520]  body scanners were first being introduced at Melbourne Airport in
[43:03.520 --> 43:07.640]  Australia detailed how the x-ray backscatter devices don't work properly
[43:07.640 --> 43:12.280]  unless the genitals of people go through them are visible and so they're told
[43:12.280 --> 43:18.040]  that that has to be visible as the marker to ensure they say the breast the
[43:18.040 --> 43:22.760]  lips and the genitals at the look for cracks in the skin areas where where to
[43:22.760 --> 43:27.080]  tell us it's tuned properly just like when you focus a camera on someone's
[43:27.080 --> 43:30.920]  face as a photographer you want to make sure that the lines at the corners of
[43:30.920 --> 43:35.040]  their eyes are crisp and so that's what they do you know when I'm focusing a
[43:35.040 --> 43:38.000]  camera on someone I'm interviewing I zoom into their eyes and make sure the
[43:38.000 --> 43:42.840]  finest cracks or their crow's feet are visible well there they're looking at
[43:42.840 --> 43:47.960]  something else it says it will this is from the newspaper it will show
[43:47.960 --> 43:52.800]  the private parts of people but this will be decided is that we're not going
[43:52.800 --> 43:57.000]  to blur those out because it severely limits the detection capability said
[43:57.000 --> 44:01.840]  the office of transport security manager Cheryl Johnson it's possible to see
[44:01.840 --> 44:05.160]  genitals and breasts while they're going through the machine she admitted the
[44:05.160 --> 44:09.280]  Lennon Guardian also reports that the genitals are completely visible and we
[44:09.280 --> 44:15.280]  have a bunch of other mainstream links there for you also another big prison
[44:15.280 --> 44:19.320]  planet dot com article inverted body scanner image shows naked body in full
[44:19.320 --> 44:26.120]  living color and drudge report took the build photo that we pushed earlier in
[44:26.120 --> 44:29.600]  the week and then they now have that on the front with Janet Napolitano gazing
[44:29.600 --> 44:34.240]  at the naked body and they have the headline that big sis wants to see your
[44:34.240 --> 44:40.960]  naked body big sis and now the head of American Airlines says he hates the
[44:40.960 --> 44:44.720]  body scanners and that it's gonna hurt airline travel you bet it is but see
[44:44.720 --> 44:47.560]  your corporation making money doesn't matter buddy
[44:47.560 --> 44:52.160]  churn off and others making money does and making people submit to this if they
[44:52.160 --> 44:55.760]  can make a submit to naked body scanning our daughters and our sons and our
[44:55.760 --> 45:00.320]  wives and our husbands then they'll get away with anything but intensify the
[45:00.320 --> 45:04.800]  boycotts intensive call Congress get them to reintroduce the bill they pass in
[45:04.800 --> 45:08.160]  the house get it through the house again in the Senate and jerk these stinking
[45:08.160 --> 45:12.000]  things out because we've got all these security experts admitting it wouldn't
[45:12.000 --> 45:16.840]  even stop the underwear bomber and that whole event stage as well national
[45:16.840 --> 45:20.360]  security advisors out there fair monitoring about this though so that's
[45:20.360 --> 45:25.000]  some of the news there also get ready for this we told you they already spent
[45:25.000 --> 45:29.000]  several billion last year conservatively they spent more than eight billion total
[45:29.000 --> 45:33.360]  on different body scanning systems in the last five years Obama orders an
[45:33.360 --> 45:38.440]  additional billion this is Toledo blade headline Obama orders one billion spent
[45:38.440 --> 45:43.680]  on airport body scanners we're at war president says in revising data and
[45:43.680 --> 45:50.560]  visa policies but then they always never even follow their own policies and then
[45:50.560 --> 45:54.400]  simultaneously they've got Homeland Security meeting with world leaders to
[45:54.400 --> 45:58.320]  implement the same systems worldwide it's globally implemented you're like
[45:58.320 --> 46:04.560]  oh it'll just for foreigners no it's for everybody so there's that and of
[46:04.560 --> 46:14.800]  course I told you that this was coming I remember CBS News 2002 headline five
[46:14.800 --> 46:22.000]  airports put brain scanners in and it says passive MRIs from a distant scan
[46:22.000 --> 46:27.120]  your brain total quackery this is what tyranny is they sent hundreds of
[46:27.120 --> 46:32.320]  thousands innocent people conservatively to prison with the lie detectors those
[46:32.320 --> 46:37.240]  that are now but not admissible for more than a decade in court total fraud
[46:37.240 --> 46:43.800]  there's totally made up doesn't work you know you're nervous about every issue
[46:43.800 --> 46:48.320]  they're asking you and so they say if it shows you're nervous who isn't nervous
[46:48.320 --> 46:55.400]  strapped into a machine with the FBI asking you questions they have other
[46:55.400 --> 46:59.840]  quack machines they've had for at least the last 15 years where they strap
[46:59.840 --> 47:04.400]  people down and show them images of the murder scene and if your brain shows
[47:04.400 --> 47:10.680]  any evidence of recognizing the images when the average person has seen several
[47:10.680 --> 47:15.640]  million images of violence countless images of real dead bodies on the news
[47:15.640 --> 47:21.920]  are people butchered shot beaten to death stabbed and so you see a brunette
[47:21.920 --> 47:31.160]  with white skin or you see a black woman with black hair in a pool of blood and
[47:31.160 --> 47:36.440]  your brain shows any recognition of that they with the quackery bringing in the
[47:36.440 --> 47:41.080]  court and say well this brain scan shows they'd seen this image before and I've
[47:41.080 --> 47:44.480]  seen the studies showing when independent universities and others test
[47:44.480 --> 47:50.080]  this it is total baloney they don't care they're going in the airports to this is
[47:50.080 --> 47:58.120]  the Associated Press today brain scanners to go in everywhere and the
[47:58.120 --> 48:04.920]  article by Michael Tarm it is written as if it's the best thing since sliced
[48:04.920 --> 48:11.160]  bread a would-be terrorist tries to board a plane bent on mass murder as he
[48:11.160 --> 48:16.040]  walks through the security checkpoint fidgeting and glancing around a network
[48:16.040 --> 48:21.680]  of high-tech machines analyzes his body language and reads his mind that's a lie
[48:21.680 --> 48:28.920]  it doesn't read your mind and China uses this to condemn people to death oh the
[48:28.920 --> 48:33.080]  machine is reading your mind no it's not it's looking at activity in certain
[48:33.080 --> 48:38.880]  sectors of the brain this is like saying because you have a video of someone
[48:38.880 --> 48:42.720]  you know what they're thinking and they're training these TSA people most
[48:42.720 --> 48:47.640]  of them don't know how to wipe their own noses about about behavioral you know
[48:47.640 --> 48:54.400]  activity in your face a would-be terrorist tries to board a plane
[48:54.400 --> 48:59.120]  bent on mass murder as he walks through the security checkpoint fidgeting and
[48:59.120 --> 49:03.680]  glancing around a network of high-tech machines analyzes his body language and
[49:03.680 --> 49:10.720]  reads his mind screeners pull him aside yes the potbellied perverts pull him
[49:10.720 --> 49:17.440]  aside tragedy is averted it oh it see it averted it a far-fetched as that sounds
[49:17.440 --> 49:23.800]  systems that aim to get inside the evildoers the evildoers had you know a
[49:23.800 --> 49:28.400]  witch floats but someone who's innocent sinks so if you drowned you're not a
[49:28.400 --> 49:33.760]  witch might as well have a dowsing rod to detect witches I mean what's the new
[49:33.760 --> 49:38.440]  quackery maybe they'll have the soothsayer what's the name of that
[49:38.440 --> 49:46.480]  black lady click miss Cleo maybe they could have miss Cleo at the airport and
[49:46.480 --> 49:51.440]  she'll decide if you're a terrorist that'd be more accurate let me see now
[49:51.440 --> 49:59.520]  maybe you is this a terrorist mine love this one here planning the booby trap the
[49:59.520 --> 50:08.080]  plane oh yes call me at the 1-800 number who yes who got the bad one here
[50:08.080 --> 50:15.160]  miss Cleo and she could have a special school and trained psychics to be at
[50:15.160 --> 50:20.440]  the airports maybe we can have a couple of a pre-cogs in a jelly jar and they
[50:20.440 --> 50:25.960]  can tell us who the terrorists are the government knows this is all fraud they
[50:25.960 --> 50:29.440]  might as well just have some tinfoil covered tinker toys set up oh the
[50:29.440 --> 50:37.440]  tinker toy says you will plan to murder everyone on Thursday in the wake of the
[50:37.440 --> 50:41.320]  Christmas Day bombing attempt over Detroit President Barack Obama and
[50:41.320 --> 50:44.920]  Homeland Security Interest Department develop better screening technology and
[50:44.920 --> 50:48.640]  of course they're calling for more brain scanners being tested in airports now
[50:48.640 --> 50:52.720]  to be deployed worldwide mind readers and it gets into all that we'll cover
[50:52.720 --> 50:59.320]  more of it when we get back the machine says you're a terrorist sending to be
[50:59.320 --> 51:07.800]  vaporized our economy is in great distress the financial dominoes can fall
[51:07.800 --> 51:13.520]  at any time it's time to stop hoping it doesn't happen and prepare just in case

[54:43.880 --> 54:50.200]  street at football games and any other event where the masses of people are
[54:50.200 --> 54:56.040]  congregated according to a leaked paper written by Dutch authorities and then
[54:56.040 --> 54:58.920]  Watson goes through and links to all the British news and others saying they're
[54:58.920 --> 55:03.360]  already doing it in England as we have been warning all along the tyranny now
[55:03.360 --> 55:08.680]  being metered out at airports was always intended to be rolled out on the
[55:08.680 --> 55:11.360]  streets the TSA's announced they're already running checkpoint station line
[55:11.360 --> 55:15.480]  with mobile metal detectors already being stationed at various transport hubs

[55:28.920 --> 55:32.480]  through people's clothing and look for concealed weapons those are already in
[55:32.480 --> 55:37.720]  at many airports and it does it from a distance
[55:38.560 --> 55:42.840]  according to a confidential document the scanner could first be used to
[55:42.840 --> 55:47.760]  alternate to random body searches in high-risk areas the mobile detector would
[55:47.760 --> 55:52.400]  enable the search to be carried out more quickly and would only be used on
[55:52.400 --> 55:56.120]  people suspected of carrying concealed weapons oh yes like everyone going through
[55:56.120 --> 56:02.080]  any public event the device would also be used from a distance on groups of
[56:02.080 --> 56:05.640]  people and mass scans of crowds at events such as football games that is a
[56:05.640 --> 56:09.640]  high-powered beam folks the biggest challenge in making it portable and
[56:09.640 --> 56:14.640]  ensuring it can carry out such a scan in seconds the professor of Indian

[59:05.600 --> 59:09.640]  how much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total
[59:09.640 --> 59:13.560]  government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is
[59:13.560 --> 59:17.840]  coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously
[59:17.840 --> 59:22.000]  overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the
[59:22.000 --> 59:26.320]  problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every
[59:26.320 --> 59:30.000]  year thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages number
[59:30.000 --> 59:34.200]  five a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of
[59:34.200 --> 59:37.600]  mind folks I really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions

[1:00:09.680 --> 1:00:17.000]  mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's
[1:00:17.000 --> 1:00:24.880]  Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[1:00:24.880 --> 1:00:31.840]  there are mass exoduses happening at the state county city in federal level out
[1:00:31.840 --> 1:00:36.120]  of the Democratic Party this is the biggest exodus we've seen the biggest
[1:00:36.120 --> 1:00:40.120]  realignment ever people thought George Bush was bad he was just a puppet they
[1:00:40.120 --> 1:00:43.760]  think Obama's bad he's just a puppet they're gonna run into the Republicans
[1:00:43.760 --> 1:00:48.560]  arms who will betray them in mass the Democrats are really waking up to Obama
[1:00:48.560 --> 1:00:54.400]  that's why my film fall the Republic and the Obama deception are so important
[1:00:54.400 --> 1:00:59.520]  we predict that Obama will plunge will fall apart will be a joke in fact you
[1:00:59.520 --> 1:01:04.240]  guys go to YouTube and type in RT just in the search box for Russia today and
[1:01:04.240 --> 1:01:10.120]  if you type then Alex Jones into the YouTube RT channel you'll see a video
[1:01:10.120 --> 1:01:19.480]  that has about 130,000 views called Alex Jones America will hate Obama and
[1:01:19.480 --> 1:01:29.600]  that was from the inauguration day January 21st 2009 and I think I'm gonna
[1:01:29.600 --> 1:01:37.840]  play that whole video on inauguration day anniversary coming up in a week and
[1:01:37.840 --> 1:01:43.240]  a half because everything I said in that 10-minute interview has come true
[1:01:43.240 --> 1:01:50.920]  everything I also predicted last year we'd see more riots worldwide over
[1:01:50.920 --> 1:01:55.280]  imploding economies they're having riots all over Europe huge riots like I
[1:01:55.280 --> 1:01:59.080]  forgot to print that print me the article about riots in Italy police there
[1:01:59.080 --> 1:02:03.440]  are huge riots the immigrant population is the first to riot tumping over cars
[1:02:03.440 --> 1:02:08.040]  burning police stations that's going on and this is just gonna get worse and
[1:02:08.040 --> 1:02:13.400]  worse and worse and worse and worse and it's all planned all engineered until
[1:02:13.400 --> 1:02:21.960]  within I'd say three years from now complete pandemonium and even people
[1:02:21.960 --> 1:02:25.640]  like myself if there's riots nearing my home I'll be asking for the army to be
[1:02:25.640 --> 1:02:30.320]  on the streets this is how they've shut it up where you'll beg for the tyranny
[1:02:30.320 --> 1:02:36.280]  you'll you'll beg for it we'd better get the word out now about this plan
[1:02:36.280 --> 1:02:42.560]  ordered out of chaos that's taking place and being launched right now it is
[1:02:42.560 --> 1:02:52.600]  absolutely vital that we reach out to the public and educate them now again
[1:02:52.600 --> 1:02:58.480]  coming up today we have Bob Chapman had been homeless in three weeks because the
[1:02:58.480 --> 1:03:04.880]  holidays we got Damon vickers financial expert and pundit joining us in the next
[1:03:04.880 --> 1:03:11.000]  segment and then we've got one of the top guys exposing able danger Colonel
[1:03:11.000 --> 1:03:17.960]  Schaefer joining us coming up in the last hour today with some new revelations
[1:03:17.960 --> 1:03:25.680]  concerning 9-11 so you'll want to stay with us for that but the you know
[1:03:25.680 --> 1:03:28.840]  there's something I wanted to talk about today and I don't really want to write
[1:03:28.840 --> 1:03:33.200]  an article about it I want to see if it stays up there but I know Matt Drudge
[1:03:33.200 --> 1:03:38.160]  calls the shots on his own website and more and more the drudge report looks
[1:03:38.160 --> 1:03:41.240]  like info wars.com which is good they talk about the New World Order they
[1:03:41.240 --> 1:03:43.920]  talk about global government they talk about the body scanners they talk about
[1:03:43.920 --> 1:03:49.760]  the banks robbing everybody drudge has really come a long way the icon of the
[1:03:49.760 --> 1:03:56.840]  internet he has now made info wars.com a featured permanent link that's what
[1:03:56.840 --> 1:04:00.800]  they call it the permanent link section of news sources on the left hand corner
[1:04:00.800 --> 1:04:06.000]  in the eye area and I don't really know what to say about that but let's go
[1:04:06.000 --> 1:04:10.160]  ahead and try to get Matt Drudge on as a guest tell him it's a friendly interview
[1:04:10.160 --> 1:04:17.440]  but who knows if that'll stay up there I'm sure the neocons will lobby to have
[1:04:17.440 --> 1:04:22.320]  it taken down because that is quite a bellwether for us to be put up there
[1:04:22.320 --> 1:04:26.760]  you know with the Christian Science Monitor and the BBC and the Associated
[1:04:26.760 --> 1:04:32.040]  Press there's only what 40 or so links he puts up there and there's info wars.com
[1:04:32.040 --> 1:04:35.640]  right in the middle so please email drudge and tell him we saluting we
[1:04:35.640 --> 1:04:41.800]  thank him we appreciate him making info wars.com part of the permanent link
[1:04:41.800 --> 1:04:46.880]  section we'll see how permanent that is I'm not too worried about it but it it
[1:04:46.880 --> 1:04:52.680]  it is a bellwether a seminal road marker on our road towards the feeding the New

[1:09:55.280 --> 1:10:00.320]  pants so that is all coming up today you know in the history books how did
[1:10:00.320 --> 1:10:04.120]  America end how do we become a high-tech police state how did Americans let
[1:10:04.120 --> 1:10:07.720]  them naked body scan their children their wives their husbands oh somebody had a
[1:10:07.720 --> 1:10:11.800]  firecracker on airplane land of the coward home of the slaves you know when
[1:10:11.800 --> 1:10:15.360]  the wind blows the American people slit their wrist and worship government and
[1:10:15.360 --> 1:10:20.920]  just scream oh god we love you government take all our rights away so
[1:10:20.920 --> 1:10:26.800]  we're gonna be breaking that down today we have Damon vickers who is syndicated
[1:10:26.800 --> 1:10:35.320]  radio hosts in his own right he is a pundit on CNN msnbc new york times
[1:10:35.320 --> 1:10:40.360]  barons investors business daily he heads up nine points capital partners and the
[1:10:40.360 --> 1:10:50.080]  website is npm dot us nine points management dot us so npm dot us and
[1:10:50.080 --> 1:10:54.760]  he's with us for the balance of the hour I agree with him a lot about gold
[1:10:54.760 --> 1:10:57.640]  being a good investment the dollar being in trouble world government being
[1:10:57.640 --> 1:11:02.200]  established I don't agree with him that we have too many people and we'll debate
[1:11:02.200 --> 1:11:05.680]  that some of the day some of our listeners really liked mr. vickers on
[1:11:05.680 --> 1:11:10.960]  his economic views didn't like him on his on his population views but he is
[1:11:10.960 --> 1:11:16.120]  back with us due to popular demand we appreciate mr. vickers joining us good
[1:11:16.120 --> 1:11:22.160]  to have you here with us Alex I love you you run a great show and I have to
[1:11:22.160 --> 1:11:26.560]  say that that I purchased your fall the republic in new world order movies and
[1:11:26.560 --> 1:11:30.560]  I watched them thoroughly and I watched I think one of them at least twice and
[1:11:30.560 --> 1:11:35.680]  they're well done and they're they're thought-provoking and I think for for a
[1:11:35.680 --> 1:11:42.600]  society in a world at large that spends too many hours per day comatose DVDs
[1:11:42.600 --> 1:11:45.600]  like that and content like that can really wake people up and they're
[1:11:45.600 --> 1:11:48.960]  good they're great they're great movies and you also notice something that I
[1:11:48.960 --> 1:11:53.160]  hadn't noticed in in a new world order that I consulted on them in but it's not
[1:11:53.160 --> 1:11:56.200]  my film though my name is on the back of it they just did that for promotion
[1:11:56.200 --> 1:12:00.240]  purposes I guess info wars.com is there is is one of the producers for some
[1:12:00.240 --> 1:12:04.960]  reason again but it's like an honorary degree or something I don't deserve it
[1:12:04.960 --> 1:12:10.920]  but I'm driving around on the radio and tuning into your radio show as they're
[1:12:10.920 --> 1:12:15.480]  interviewing me and so there's a snip of you in New World Order so I certainly
[1:12:15.480 --> 1:12:19.720]  certainly a strange coincidence. It's strange yeah especially with the new
[1:12:19.720 --> 1:12:23.600]  world order thing yeah well I mean that was here's I'm I don't do a radio show
[1:12:23.600 --> 1:12:27.680]  anymore but there was a time that I was on about 45 stations five days a week
[1:12:27.680 --> 1:12:33.960]  for two to three hours a day and and during that period between 2000 and
[1:12:33.960 --> 1:12:40.320]  2003 when the NASDAQ was collapsing I spent a good part of my radio show you
[1:12:40.320 --> 1:12:47.160]  know bashing the CNBCs and and the Bush administration and and the like so the
[1:12:47.160 --> 1:12:51.920]  trend was certainly down and there were cheerleaders for a collapsing market and
[1:12:51.920 --> 1:12:58.200]  I wasn't one of them. Now Damon briefly tell us a little bit about your business
[1:12:58.200 --> 1:13:02.120]  operation and some of its success because you know that's really why we
[1:13:02.120 --> 1:13:05.960]  have you here is because you've been one of the most accurate and successful
[1:13:05.960 --> 1:13:10.760]  people out there and predicting where things are going. Well we're we're I
[1:13:10.760 --> 1:13:14.680]  run a fund and we also run a private wealth side our fund nine points
[1:13:14.680 --> 1:13:21.000]  capital partners had a fantastic year in 2008 2008 was arguably one of the worst
[1:13:21.000 --> 1:13:25.480]  years in market history with you know trillions of dollars of value being
[1:13:25.480 --> 1:13:30.920]  wiped out and and our fund rose by 63 percent that year which is a pretty good
[1:13:30.920 --> 1:13:37.240]  thing so we made money in a bear market and and more than a little I'm also if
[1:13:37.240 --> 1:13:42.280]  you take a look at the 2000 to 2003 period we were short during that whole
[1:13:42.280 --> 1:13:48.320]  duration as well and when 9-11 hit you know we were a hundred percent short
[1:13:48.320 --> 1:13:52.400]  and not because I had inside information or do anything like that but
[1:13:52.400 --> 1:13:56.440]  because the trend was very decidedly down and that's something that we believe
[1:13:56.440 --> 1:14:01.520]  that news that we can't necessarily always know what the news can be we can
[1:14:01.520 --> 1:14:05.800]  we can monitor what the trends are what the societal trends are I think you do
[1:14:05.800 --> 1:14:11.800]  a great job at that Alex but the news tends to reinforce whatever our
[1:14:11.800 --> 1:14:16.720]  positions usually are if the trend is either up or down so we were flexible
[1:14:16.720 --> 1:14:21.960]  we're fluid where our style is adaptive and and so that I think that gives us
[1:14:21.960 --> 1:14:27.280]  an edge as investors other investors are more attached to what they think they
[1:14:27.280 --> 1:14:29.880]  know or they're worrying about the future but they're not really living in
[1:14:29.880 --> 1:14:33.880]  the present and that's something that we don't do living in the present is what
[1:14:33.880 --> 1:14:38.480]  we what we do do here at nine points management research and at nine points
[1:14:38.480 --> 1:14:42.840]  capital partners okay I want to get into the economy and what you see in the
[1:14:42.840 --> 1:14:48.440]  year 2010 with Damon vickers but first let's go back to the controversy of the
[1:14:48.440 --> 1:14:53.960]  last time you were on with us three months ago you were talking about your
[1:14:53.960 --> 1:15:00.720]  view on world overpopulation and that you know something must be done about it
[1:15:00.720 --> 1:15:05.960]  and from my research that's really the governing push for world government
[1:15:05.960 --> 1:15:10.000]  according to the UN's own statements is to set up a planetary government as the
[1:15:10.000 --> 1:15:16.120]  White House science are has said to order a one-child policy the UN a few
[1:15:16.120 --> 1:15:20.200]  weeks ago at Copenhagen called for a global one-child policy the communist
[1:15:20.200 --> 1:15:24.160]  Chinese called for that there have been editorials all over the news papers and
[1:15:24.160 --> 1:15:31.640]  on TV calling for in fact the BBC says should we bring back rationing today I
[1:15:31.640 --> 1:15:35.080]  have that article right here for prisonplanet.tv viewers who aren't
[1:15:35.080 --> 1:15:38.640]  tuning in on the radio but watching us at prisonplanet.tv should we bring back
[1:15:38.640 --> 1:15:43.840]  rationing to save the environment I mean that is hardcore tyranny what is what is
[1:15:43.840 --> 1:15:49.600]  your real view on world population and how do you substantiate that we're
[1:15:49.600 --> 1:15:55.200]  overpopulated and what do you say we do then well I mean I mean I'm glad you
[1:15:55.200 --> 1:15:59.240]  brought up the Chinese because you know when we think of the Chinese they were
[1:15:59.240 --> 1:16:06.000]  they were a country and a society that was so enmeshed in malaise you know
[1:16:06.000 --> 1:16:10.560]  they'd had some very you know austere programs under Mao and a rejection of
[1:16:10.560 --> 1:16:14.480]  their their you know their emperor system and all that and they went to that
[1:16:14.480 --> 1:16:23.440]  one-child system and I think it was a good part of their quote economic birth
[1:16:23.440 --> 1:16:26.760]  I mean people would never thought the Chinese could get themselves together
[1:16:26.760 --> 1:16:31.320]  they would people would always talk about China as a region of the world that
[1:16:31.320 --> 1:16:36.880]  had promise you know Wrigley Wrigley gum would get a contract to sell gum in
[1:16:36.880 --> 1:16:40.640]  China and that I remember the conversation with some guy down in Texas and
[1:16:40.640 --> 1:16:44.320]  him saying well think about all those billions of Chinese chewing on Wrigley
[1:16:44.320 --> 1:16:48.400]  gum so in the stock went up you know it was three four five dollars that day
[1:16:48.400 --> 1:16:52.320]  when they got that contract but they they as a country have turned have turned
[1:16:52.320 --> 1:16:57.360]  things around economically now that has come at a cost there's no doubt China is
[1:16:57.360 --> 1:17:03.400]  a very austere police state authoritarian centralized control
[1:17:03.400 --> 1:17:08.080]  government not much of anything happens by chance in China it is heavily
[1:17:08.080 --> 1:17:13.000]  designed you ask the question though about the what is my real view on on
[1:17:13.000 --> 1:17:16.920]  population I would I would ask you have you have you I mean I I assume you're
[1:17:16.920 --> 1:17:21.040]  you're an educated man you're a Renaissance man you're a free thinker all
[1:17:21.040 --> 1:17:24.720]  things that I love about you Alex have you traveled at all to places like the
[1:17:24.720 --> 1:17:29.480]  Caribbean have you been places like in the South America yet yes some of this
[1:17:29.480 --> 1:17:33.600]  have you seen you've been places like that have you seen pictures of the world
[1:17:33.600 --> 1:17:37.960]  at night I'm sure you have or they were they've the lights out you know lights
[1:17:37.960 --> 1:17:41.560]  used to go out it doesn't go out anymore when when when when the when the
[1:17:41.560 --> 1:17:45.520]  sun sets on a large part of the planet we're looking at the earth from space
[1:17:45.520 --> 1:17:49.400]  you ever seen those pictures the planet where the world as we see lights we see
[1:17:49.400 --> 1:17:53.440]  lights especially around the coastlines it's a bit around the coastlines but
[1:17:53.440 --> 1:17:57.160]  also the cities and then the northeast in particular and the Caribbean and
[1:17:57.160 --> 1:18:02.440]  Puerto Rico and and there isn't much of the world that we haven't lit up and
[1:18:02.440 --> 1:18:06.760]  really probably because we're afraid that's why we have to hold the lights
[1:18:06.760 --> 1:18:10.300]  on because we're biological creatures and we don't want we're afraid of the
[1:18:10.300 --> 1:18:16.000]  dark fear is a large element of what we as humans still face and it's as you
[1:18:16.000 --> 1:18:21.520]  point out all the time fear has been a very effective means of controlling a
[1:18:21.520 --> 1:18:25.340]  population who is fear-based and we still are we're so afraid of what goes
[1:18:25.340 --> 1:18:28.200]  bump in the night and of things that were not there were and people that look
[1:18:28.200 --> 1:18:36.560]  different than us on we do have we do have in regions of the world a an
[1:18:36.560 --> 1:18:43.840]  imbalance of population relative to what the resources can support and you
[1:18:43.840 --> 1:18:47.920]  take a look at places in Africa where that is the case South America where
[1:18:47.920 --> 1:18:53.200]  that's the case and in particular the Caribbean these and increasingly in the
[1:18:53.200 --> 1:18:58.920]  Middle East and these are these are areas where you have a lot of tribal
[1:18:58.920 --> 1:19:04.440]  societies nomadic peoples and trend Indian societies and tribal cultures in
[1:19:04.440 --> 1:19:09.920]  in Africa that have been had the the benefit and I say that really
[1:19:09.920 --> 1:19:14.640]  sarcastically and with new it they've had the benefit of Western influenced or
[1:19:14.640 --> 1:19:20.720]  missionaries or do-gooders or you know grand social involvement by the Peace
[1:19:20.720 --> 1:19:26.560]  Corps or whatever it is to try to help them out and it hasn't helped in fact to
[1:19:26.560 --> 1:19:31.160]  the extent that we've been involved in Africa or South America to try to
[1:19:31.160 --> 1:19:36.120]  mitigate poverty or disease or suffering we have only compounded the
[1:19:36.120 --> 1:19:41.600]  problem and geometrically increased the level of suffering faced by people
[1:19:41.600 --> 1:19:45.680]  but Damon I have the Royal Commission on Population I have State Department
[1:19:45.680 --> 1:19:50.040]  memorandum 200 this was all planned they're not trying to help and we come
[1:19:50.040 --> 1:19:54.760]  back I'm gonna counter what you've said but I also want you to boil down in a

[1:24:05.640 --> 1:24:21.440]  don't call my name and vickers who heads up nine points capital partners the
[1:24:21.440 --> 1:24:28.520]  websites NPM Nancy Paul Mary dot US is with us for the rest of the hour we're
[1:24:28.520 --> 1:24:32.880]  gonna open the phones up for first-time callers for questions or comments to
[1:24:32.880 --> 1:24:37.960]  Damon vickers questions on the economy you name and he really is a shining
[1:24:37.960 --> 1:24:48.600]  mind when it comes to that 1-800-259-9231 1-800-259-9231 on this live
[1:24:48.600 --> 1:24:54.840]  January 8th Friday edition 2010 okay Damon here's the deal I've read all the
[1:24:54.840 --> 1:24:59.480]  population studies even by the eugenicists by the UN for over a decade
[1:24:59.480 --> 1:25:06.520]  they've known that world population by 2022 to 2024 will plan out at 8.5 to 8.6
[1:25:06.520 --> 1:25:10.960]  billion then they project in the next 20 years it will drop down below 8 billion
[1:25:10.960 --> 1:25:16.640]  that's at current statistics without more family planning and forced
[1:25:16.640 --> 1:25:22.560]  sterilization and forced abortions in China India is the one nation that
[1:25:22.560 --> 1:25:25.800]  probably won't plan out it'll just continue to grow and it's mainly what
[1:25:25.800 --> 1:25:32.520]  pushes the trend up but look at the West from Japan the industrialized world to
[1:25:32.520 --> 1:25:39.680]  the to the classical West Europe the United States Canada 1.3 population
[1:25:39.680 --> 1:25:42.840]  replacement rate for every two adults for those that don't know they have on
[1:25:42.840 --> 1:25:47.320]  average 1.3 children and most of the population reduction programs being
[1:25:47.320 --> 1:25:51.440]  launched are being launched in the West against cultures that are already dying
[1:25:51.440 --> 1:25:57.600]  the West is dying and I have the Royal Commission from 49 with the British
[1:25:57.600 --> 1:26:02.160]  said if we industrialize the third world they'll stop having kids they'll be
[1:26:02.160 --> 1:26:06.080]  like the West and and even stop replacing themselves but we're not gonna
[1:26:06.080 --> 1:26:10.040]  do that we're gonna go in and stop industrialization to the IMF and World
[1:26:10.040 --> 1:26:15.720]  Bank as a political tool and let the people bomb actually hold them back so
[1:26:15.720 --> 1:26:19.800]  my problem is the UN says they want world government to reduce population
[1:26:19.800 --> 1:26:23.280]  which you can argue we have too many or too less or whatever when I say it's a
[1:26:23.280 --> 1:26:27.800]  non-issue we need clean technologies and I mean this is I mean I could go on for
[1:26:27.800 --> 1:26:31.720]  10 hours with all the evidence it's a non-issue to scare everybody into
[1:26:31.720 --> 1:26:37.080]  resource wars artificially making water and other things scares but that's what
[1:26:37.080 --> 1:26:42.760]  you go down to the Caribbean Alex and it's not a non-issue I mean you can see
[1:26:42.760 --> 1:26:48.480]  it clearly on playing out right there no everybody is concentrated you've got
[1:26:48.480 --> 1:26:54.640]  you've got men that have fathered up to 26 and 28 children my father's a loose
[1:26:54.640 --> 1:26:57.960]  word because all they did was bounce around on the flowers and put their
[1:26:57.960 --> 1:27:03.200]  put their pollen where needed to go that's crazy reckless behavior you know
[1:27:03.200 --> 1:27:06.680]  if this is all about freedom we want people to have freedom and we want a
[1:27:06.680 --> 1:27:11.720]  world of freedom and everybody here's the deal the UN wants to get rid of the
[1:27:11.720 --> 1:27:15.760]  freedom you want are you worried about about being deprived of your right
[1:27:15.760 --> 1:27:22.640]  Alex to have 28 kids I know the UN's calling for the UN's calling for me to
[1:27:22.640 --> 1:27:26.640]  only be able to have one the UN's calling for me to only be able to have one I
[1:27:26.640 --> 1:27:32.680]  have three Damon and if I could I would have five or six okay Alex well that
[1:27:32.680 --> 1:27:38.200]  comes that's that comes at a cost and we since we are our planet is actually of
[1:27:38.200 --> 1:27:42.600]  a limited size if we continue to expand like we have we don't have much of a
[1:27:42.600 --> 1:27:46.160]  world left it's worth enjoying and I don't really care for asphalt and
[1:27:46.160 --> 1:27:50.200]  subdivisions and I don't think that's a progress that's not a world that's
[1:27:50.200 --> 1:27:55.240]  actually very attractive I don't have any children and a pavement yes I do how
[1:27:55.240 --> 1:28:02.400]  many I have three doors and do you want them to be able to procreate they may
[1:28:02.400 --> 1:28:06.840]  have a desire to but inevitably they'll have to be their decision well but it
[1:28:06.840 --> 1:28:10.560]  may be the UN's decision it may be the global government after the banks of
[1:28:10.560 --> 1:28:15.560]  all bankrupt is by design individuals on a global basis Alex are unable to be to
[1:28:15.560 --> 1:28:20.640]  make responsible decisions then of course global government will likely step
[1:28:20.640 --> 1:28:25.240]  in and begin making those decisions for them if the United States is unable to
[1:28:25.240 --> 1:28:30.720]  make rational realistic decisions about about its debt and its consumption about
[1:28:30.720 --> 1:28:35.400]  its me-me-me right to consume the planet's reason the banks created the
[1:28:35.400 --> 1:28:40.840]  false debt system to take over we have to step in and begin to tell us how to
[1:28:40.840 --> 1:28:47.040]  behave because we've been unable to do it ourselves no population is gonna peak
[1:28:47.040 --> 1:28:52.440]  in the next 12 years it is going to peak and then it's going to see if there's
[1:28:52.440 --> 1:28:54.760]  no way there's no way for you to know that how do you know what's gonna happen
[1:28:54.760 --> 1:28:59.920]  the UN for several decades has had very accurate statistical analysis this is
[1:28:59.920 --> 1:29:04.320]  not that's projecting out into the future it means nothing but there's nobody
[1:29:04.320 --> 1:29:07.440]  knows what really they projected 20 years ago that we'd have seven million
[1:29:07.440 --> 1:29:13.200]  people by 2010 but I'm sure you also have other resource research that says
[1:29:13.200 --> 1:29:17.520]  that they're genetically engineered viruses and that they could do
[1:29:17.520 --> 1:29:20.940]  population control by genetically engineering viruses as well could they
[1:29:20.940 --> 1:29:26.360]  not that that's what Dick Cheney wants you know well there you go now they
[1:29:26.360 --> 1:29:29.720]  don't have to do it they don't need that that will not that could happen all by
[1:29:29.720 --> 1:29:34.280]  itself Damon justice be done may the heavens fall you put a bunch of chickens
[1:29:34.280 --> 1:29:38.780]  in a limited amount of space and chances are they're gonna face diseases Damon
[1:29:38.780 --> 1:29:44.720]  Damon there's 30 plus million Chinese extra men it's caused incredible
[1:29:44.720 --> 1:29:49.920]  suicide and problems in China China has buoyed because they did a deal with the
[1:29:49.920 --> 1:29:53.200]  globalist to deindustrialize the West they've been given all our money stay
[1:29:53.200 --> 1:29:58.360]  there we'll come back talk about it we're on the March the Empire's on the run
[1:29:58.360 --> 1:30:05.640]  Alex Jones and the GCN radio network this is Alex Jones with five good
[1:30:05.640 --> 1:30:09.640]  reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator number one new
[1:30:09.640 --> 1:30:13.440]  climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill number two
[1:30:13.440 --> 1:30:17.520]  our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company
[1:30:17.520 --> 1:30:21.760]  allows you to have it's true total government control of electricity in the
[1:30:21.760 --> 1:30:26.040]  name of smart grid technology is coming number three in some areas of the
[1:30:26.040 --> 1:30:30.040]  country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist
[1:30:30.040 --> 1:30:34.400]  legislation is only compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is
[1:30:34.400 --> 1:30:38.160]  always a threat to local grids every year thousands of families lose their
[1:30:38.160 --> 1:30:42.280]  power from weather-related onages number five a solar power generator provides
[1:30:42.280 --> 1:30:46.120]  powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks I really believe in the solar
[1:30:46.120 --> 1:30:49.600]  power generators offered by solutions from science one of my oldest sponsors
[1:30:49.600 --> 1:30:54.760]  you can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com that's my solar
[1:30:54.760 --> 1:30:59.040]  backup.com remember the government doesn't own the sun so go to my solar

[1:31:05.160 --> 1:31:08.840]  hi folks this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the silver lungs
[1:31:08.840 --> 1:31:13.600]  generator now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the
[1:31:13.600 --> 1:31:17.520]  solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the
[1:31:17.520 --> 1:31:21.360]  lungs the respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne
[1:31:21.360 --> 1:31:26.320]  pathogens and viruses the silver lungs generator infuses the respiratory system
[1:31:26.320 --> 1:31:31.600]  with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver
[1:31:31.600 --> 1:31:36.200]  nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream with continued legislation
[1:31:36.200 --> 1:31:40.400]  threatening the sale of nano-silver products you can now produce pure and
[1:31:40.400 --> 1:31:45.360]  endless colloidal silver with the silver lungs generator very easy to follow
[1:31:45.360 --> 1:31:49.800]  step-by-step instructions are provided making production fast and simple go
[1:31:49.800 --> 1:31:54.960]  to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough
[1:31:54.960 --> 1:32:01.840]  technology of the silver lungs generator that's www.silverlungs.com
[1:32:04.360 --> 1:32:09.120]  hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone this
[1:32:09.120 --> 1:32:13.840]  is our last chance to not relive history as we're finishing off this agenda
[1:32:13.840 --> 1:32:17.640]  that we're pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home I've
[1:32:17.640 --> 1:32:22.680]  tremendous influence on our president in Congress and they really are calling
[1:32:22.680 --> 1:32:27.960]  the shots I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay
[1:32:27.960 --> 1:32:32.480]  attention for the republic identifies the enemies of our nation the criminal
[1:32:32.480 --> 1:32:37.160]  offshore cartel hell bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes
[1:32:37.160 --> 1:32:41.200]  constructing world government Tim Geithner Bernanke the arsonists they're
[1:32:41.200 --> 1:32:44.880]  asking for more matches and the Congress is saying who do we make the checkout to
[1:32:44.880 --> 1:32:49.960]  today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen
[1:32:49.960 --> 1:32:56.040]  a fall of the Republic get your copy of fall of the Republic on DVD at info
[1:32:56.040 --> 1:33:01.480]  wars.com we're watching online right now in super high quality at prison planet
[1:33:01.480 --> 1:33:04.080]  TV
[1:33:04.080 --> 1:33:15.480]  Damon Vickers is our guest he heads up one of the most successful management
[1:33:15.480 --> 1:33:22.360]  firms and investment funds out there nine points capital partners npm.us is
[1:33:22.360 --> 1:33:26.360]  the website I'm Alex Jones our websites are info wars.com and prison
[1:33:26.360 --> 1:33:31.360]  planet.com and I want to talk about a host of other issues in the time we have
[1:33:31.360 --> 1:33:35.840]  left with Damon I didn't mean to get stuck on the whole population agenda my
[1:33:35.840 --> 1:33:39.520]  point is whether you believe we're overpopulated or not the globalist
[1:33:39.520 --> 1:33:45.320]  have actually moved to keep the third world in poverty and cause the people
[1:33:45.320 --> 1:33:49.520]  bomb while they're then always selling eugenics and population and one child
[1:33:49.520 --> 1:33:54.200]  policies in the West and if you really study eugenics it's not what is
[1:33:54.200 --> 1:33:58.800]  publicly taught about improving the race improving intelligence it's actually
[1:33:58.800 --> 1:34:03.800]  targeting the most intelligent that aren't part of the elites they call
[1:34:03.800 --> 1:34:07.920]  you the random genetics out there that in that threatens the global elites
[1:34:07.920 --> 1:34:14.040]  hegemonic empire and I just morally cannot sign on to China and forced
[1:34:14.040 --> 1:34:19.240]  abortion and infanticide and killing babies and Damon I don't think if I
[1:34:19.240 --> 1:34:22.520]  took you to China and put you in front of a woman here that I advocated and I
[1:34:22.520 --> 1:34:26.080]  didn't hear any of that and if it's if it's about keeping the globalist
[1:34:26.080 --> 1:34:30.520]  hegemonic intact and the world childs in the bill the brokers and keeping that
[1:34:30.520 --> 1:34:36.360]  that that fine genetic line intact that the truth is that that those lines and
[1:34:36.360 --> 1:34:40.760]  families on that they're real problems with those people i mean when you don't
[1:34:40.760 --> 1:34:46.080]  intermix families genetic code or you have too much marrying amongst cousins
[1:34:46.080 --> 1:34:50.320]  on you get some kind of strange outcomes you get a you get people that are uh...
[1:34:50.320 --> 1:34:55.320]  manic depressive suicidal interest you get more psychopaths
[1:34:55.320 --> 1:34:58.880]  you get more psychopaths you know i mean you can take a look at uh...
[1:34:58.880 --> 1:35:00.240]  i mean
[1:35:00.240 --> 1:35:04.320]  i don't have a good look at the world he looked at royalties always going insane
[1:35:04.320 --> 1:35:09.560]  from Egypt to Rome that's how they did it but Alex for it for a long period in
[1:35:09.560 --> 1:35:14.320]  time that is how they did it cousins married cousins and that went on for a
[1:35:14.320 --> 1:35:15.880]  very long time
[1:35:15.880 --> 1:35:19.680]  it's particularly if your family had money
[1:35:19.680 --> 1:35:21.360]  but it's still going on
[1:35:21.360 --> 1:35:23.760]  it still goes on to some extent yeah yeah
[1:35:23.760 --> 1:35:26.960]  what's bad genetically though you need to have a you have a healthier gene
[1:35:26.960 --> 1:35:29.500]  call what i'm asking is that why do you agree
[1:35:29.500 --> 1:35:32.240]  uh... i wasn't saying you agree with forced abortion in china
[1:35:32.240 --> 1:35:33.600]  i'm saying i
[1:35:33.600 --> 1:35:37.200]  i can't well then you have to be against the policy
[1:35:37.200 --> 1:35:42.720]  i make i'm against i'm against a world and and countries and individuals that
[1:35:42.720 --> 1:35:44.240]  think that they can have
[1:35:44.240 --> 1:35:46.560]  haphazardly and recklessly
[1:35:46.560 --> 1:35:51.360]  without that there being some responsibility to their fellow fellow
[1:35:51.360 --> 1:35:55.360]  uh... beings whether that be animals or plant life for human beings
[1:35:55.360 --> 1:35:58.440]  but damon here's what i'm saying if europe
[1:35:58.440 --> 1:36:02.480]  and the united states in japan are having on average one point three children
[1:36:02.480 --> 1:36:05.800]  which doesn't replace mommy and daddy we don't need
[1:36:05.800 --> 1:36:09.520]  food rationing and one-child policies in america
[1:36:09.520 --> 1:36:13.080]  well we we we don't need it in america but at that this point america doesn't
[1:36:13.080 --> 1:36:16.000]  support itself anyway we're net importers of food
[1:36:16.000 --> 1:36:20.720]  we can't feed ourselves and we export that's because of government policies
[1:36:20.720 --> 1:36:22.880]  paying people not to produce food
[1:36:22.880 --> 1:36:26.480]  that's because of nafta and gat and globalization which is designed to make
[1:36:26.480 --> 1:36:30.240]  the world population dependent on the social engineers
[1:36:30.240 --> 1:36:32.320]  okay
[1:36:32.320 --> 1:36:36.640]  so what might as a fund manager might might might might i have to think about
[1:36:36.640 --> 1:36:38.200]  how i'm going to make money from that
[1:36:38.200 --> 1:36:41.720]  because i have investors and and and people that i have to uh...
[1:36:41.720 --> 1:36:43.200]  report to the policy
[1:36:43.200 --> 1:36:45.400]  capital gains
[1:36:45.400 --> 1:36:49.000]  so um... i can't determine the direction of the world alex i don't think you
[1:36:49.000 --> 1:36:52.200]  can either i i i i i i would think we both agree
[1:36:52.200 --> 1:36:55.600]  that we don't want a world that they move into a world that it's uh... that it's
[1:36:55.600 --> 1:36:57.520]  uh... of police state
[1:36:57.520 --> 1:37:01.040]  whereby uh... it's a very negative and dark
[1:37:01.040 --> 1:37:03.200]  however we do need uh... we
[1:37:03.200 --> 1:37:08.720]  i think shown that that uh... all of this experiment called democracy
[1:37:08.720 --> 1:37:11.880]  uh... has had unintended consequences
[1:37:11.880 --> 1:37:17.080]  uh... and is not really not really made american people really all that free
[1:37:17.080 --> 1:37:20.600]  although they have the illusion of freedom we don't have uh... i mean
[1:37:20.600 --> 1:37:24.680]  even a m howling mob of democracy we have manufactured consent
[1:37:24.680 --> 1:37:28.120]  uh... diamond shifting gears in the time we have with you here i agree with
[1:37:28.120 --> 1:37:30.800]  that you're talking about the two parties going against each other
[1:37:30.800 --> 1:37:34.800]  and that the fantasy of democrat versus republican i totally agree with that
[1:37:34.800 --> 1:37:35.840]  totally
[1:37:35.840 --> 1:37:40.040]  it is a fantasy that we ask you this form of uh... what do you see happening to
[1:37:40.040 --> 1:37:44.120]  obama lowest approval writing one year and of any president democrats turning
[1:37:44.120 --> 1:37:45.200]  against him
[1:37:45.200 --> 1:37:49.000]  uh... we're gonna get some probably even worse republican later
[1:37:49.000 --> 1:37:52.880]  uh... and then and even worse democrat after that it just uh... as everything
[1:37:52.880 --> 1:37:56.440]  goes downhill what do you see happening economically politically
[1:37:56.440 --> 1:37:59.240]  in the next twenty four months of the united states
[1:37:59.240 --> 1:38:02.400]  well you bring up a good a good point between the republicans and democrats
[1:38:02.400 --> 1:38:04.200]  i certainly hope
[1:38:04.200 --> 1:38:08.280]  that we actually don't swim back to uh... a republican and perhaps we have
[1:38:08.280 --> 1:38:11.720]  the we have the type of environment where maybe you get somebody that's uh...
[1:38:11.720 --> 1:38:13.640]  that that's not aligned
[1:38:13.640 --> 1:38:18.080]  that's not a part of a of a fantasy of a democrat a republican and yes both the
[1:38:18.080 --> 1:38:20.640]  democrats and both the republicans
[1:38:20.640 --> 1:38:22.040]  are controlled
[1:38:22.040 --> 1:38:25.200]  entities and their controlled entities by his family
[1:38:25.200 --> 1:38:29.120]  your family interests in the case of the tyson family or that
[1:38:29.120 --> 1:38:33.600]  or uh... the students investment bank or or others and uh... it takes a lot of
[1:38:33.600 --> 1:38:36.800]  money it takes a couple hundred million dollars or more to get elected president
[1:38:36.800 --> 1:38:39.400]  and by the time you actually swear your oath
[1:38:39.400 --> 1:38:41.400]  you have totally sold out
[1:38:41.400 --> 1:38:44.600]  whatever so you had a thousand times over here up
[1:38:44.600 --> 1:38:48.080]  but so let's talk to the man by the time you you're sworn in
[1:38:48.080 --> 1:38:49.280]  uh...
[1:38:49.280 --> 1:38:52.240]  i hope that we get a third party candidate that's what i hope
[1:38:52.240 --> 1:38:56.480]  uh... uh... in terms of uh... the u.s. though the whole the united states and
[1:38:56.480 --> 1:38:58.520]  the global and uh... on a whole
[1:38:58.520 --> 1:39:01.000]  we've got a lot of debt sovereign debt
[1:39:01.000 --> 1:39:04.640]  and increasingly we don't have a means or an ability to pay it off
[1:39:04.640 --> 1:39:08.400]  but neither does much of the rest of the westernized world
[1:39:08.400 --> 1:39:10.840]  and that debt is mounting and it's accumulating
[1:39:10.840 --> 1:39:14.160]  but it's fiat debt made up out of nothing
[1:39:14.160 --> 1:39:17.900]  so that the speculators can take over the planet
[1:39:17.900 --> 1:39:20.680]  well they're not good i don't know what they're gonna get the whole world is
[1:39:20.680 --> 1:39:21.640]  right
[1:39:21.640 --> 1:39:25.280]  financially i don't know what the benefit of what would they be taking over a
[1:39:25.280 --> 1:39:28.720]  bankrupt company what's the value that i'll see they're too big to fail so
[1:39:28.720 --> 1:39:30.760]  everything else will fail but then
[1:39:30.760 --> 1:39:33.740]  they'll be the last man standing so even if they're the
[1:39:33.740 --> 1:39:37.620]  wreckage of the ship of state and society they will be
[1:39:37.620 --> 1:39:42.240]  that which all the rats cling to i don't know i you could also look if i
[1:39:42.240 --> 1:39:46.560]  wreck you economically alex will say alex jones is a country and i'd wreck you
[1:39:46.560 --> 1:39:47.880]  economically
[1:39:47.880 --> 1:39:51.760]  and then i get to take you over but good at that
[1:39:51.760 --> 1:39:55.640]  but i got i got to be a look at military tactics you get to rebuild it i want to
[1:39:55.640 --> 1:39:57.760]  take over something that's wrong and viable
[1:39:57.760 --> 1:40:01.240]  now you get to read about no no no the globalist takeover strong countries
[1:40:01.240 --> 1:40:03.280]  and then use them to exploit the neighbor
[1:40:03.280 --> 1:40:06.280]  and wage war and covert destabilizations
[1:40:06.280 --> 1:40:11.200]  on a larger on a larger on a larger scale though you can say that that that
[1:40:11.200 --> 1:40:12.840]  our democratic system
[1:40:12.840 --> 1:40:16.360]  in the way that it's based upon allowing everybody to kind of get what
[1:40:16.360 --> 1:40:17.240]  they want
[1:40:17.240 --> 1:40:21.520]  and then people get elected and they're both of all the special interest
[1:40:21.520 --> 1:40:25.760]  that that by the time that it's all done with you just in that all this debt
[1:40:25.760 --> 1:40:29.200]  because you've had to pay off all the people that they got elected because
[1:40:29.200 --> 1:40:32.080]  big government isn't real free market
[1:40:32.080 --> 1:40:37.800]  it allows that crony monopoly capitalism and they buy off this howling mob the
[1:40:37.800 --> 1:40:38.640]  horde
[1:40:38.640 --> 1:40:41.560]  to then finally loot the middle class that was left
[1:40:41.560 --> 1:40:44.840]  and then everything collapses that's what happened in roam that's what happens
[1:40:44.840 --> 1:40:46.320]  everywhere
[1:40:46.320 --> 1:40:49.080]  and it ended and it is likely to happen again
[1:40:49.080 --> 1:40:52.880]  and so and we are likely in the process of that happening again
[1:40:52.880 --> 1:40:58.640]  and neither you know i can't likely do much to change that natural course
[1:40:58.640 --> 1:41:00.800]  of direction but what we can do
[1:41:00.800 --> 1:41:03.280]  is try to position ourselves financially
[1:41:03.280 --> 1:41:07.720]  and try to position ourselves and our families so that that we survive and
[1:41:07.720 --> 1:41:12.240]  seek to thrive and prosper in the environment that we have not the
[1:41:12.240 --> 1:41:14.000]  environment that we want
[1:41:14.000 --> 1:41:16.640]  well i agree i mean i mean i work for a better world
[1:41:16.640 --> 1:41:19.840]  but also position myself to be in the best possible position
[1:41:19.840 --> 1:41:23.560]  and in knowing what's coming in the future i've been very successful
[1:41:23.560 --> 1:41:27.320]  and and these other fools that think buying mainstream television
[1:41:27.320 --> 1:41:31.800]  which is meant to deceive them and to tie them up in false realities
[1:41:31.800 --> 1:41:34.400]  is meant to neutralize them and keep them out of the game
[1:41:34.400 --> 1:41:36.520]  the average yuppie thinks it's cool
[1:41:36.520 --> 1:41:37.840]  to spout off
[1:41:37.840 --> 1:41:39.760]  the party line of the system
[1:41:39.760 --> 1:41:41.160]  thinking they're smart
[1:41:41.160 --> 1:41:42.840]  like some mindless parrot
[1:41:42.840 --> 1:41:45.720]  that's been you know taught to repeat something
[1:41:45.720 --> 1:41:47.080]  dead on alex
[1:41:47.080 --> 1:41:51.480]  yeah that is dead on that's exactly right that the fantasy that we might have
[1:41:51.480 --> 1:41:54.760]  of bashing liberals or bashing conservatives
[1:41:54.760 --> 1:41:58.600]  is a game that we play against each other and it's just ridiculous and it's
[1:41:58.600 --> 1:42:00.120]  worth it's just so
[1:42:00.120 --> 1:42:01.760]  utterly retarded
[1:42:01.760 --> 1:42:06.360]  uh... uh... yeah i totally agree with you absolutely i i think the good
[1:42:06.360 --> 1:42:09.000]  news is i think more and more people alex
[1:42:09.000 --> 1:42:11.880]  are getting a waking up to that fact
[1:42:11.880 --> 1:42:15.280]  you do a good job of bringing it out to people of telling them that and they
[1:42:15.280 --> 1:42:16.640]  need to know that
[1:42:16.640 --> 1:42:20.600]  that bashing you know that liberal bashing or conservative bashing at
[1:42:20.600 --> 1:42:22.320]  this is a stupid
[1:42:22.320 --> 1:42:26.520]  game that has no end but with with no ultimate so we just play each other off
[1:42:26.520 --> 1:42:27.120]  each other
[1:42:27.120 --> 1:42:30.560]  with real no progress or moving forward it's ridiculous
[1:42:30.560 --> 1:42:32.800]  we don't even deal with the issues in hand
[1:42:32.800 --> 1:42:34.440]  david vickers
[1:42:34.440 --> 1:42:37.960]  nine points capital management in the p m dot u s
[1:42:37.960 --> 1:42:41.120]  just in layman's terms what do you see happening with the economy with the
[1:42:41.120 --> 1:42:42.440]  dollar with gold
[1:42:42.440 --> 1:42:44.480]  with stocks with bonds
[1:42:44.480 --> 1:42:48.280]  you know basic boil down of what you see happening in the next twelve months
[1:42:48.280 --> 1:42:49.360]  and forward
[1:42:49.360 --> 1:42:51.160]  with the economy
[1:42:51.160 --> 1:42:55.160]  well i hate doing that i i really do because that the person inside me that
[1:42:55.160 --> 1:42:57.840]  says they don't want to live in the the future he doesn't want to live in the
[1:42:57.840 --> 1:42:59.920]  past but want to be president a moment
[1:42:59.920 --> 1:43:03.480]  doesn't like to make make projections however what's taking a look at where
[1:43:03.480 --> 1:43:04.720]  the moment is
[1:43:04.720 --> 1:43:07.640]  and where we're likely headed on what we're looking at uh...
[1:43:07.640 --> 1:43:11.000]  dollar continue to look it looks weaker because they're they're continued to have
[1:43:11.000 --> 1:43:12.040]  to print money
[1:43:12.040 --> 1:43:17.040]  uh... this morning we came out with jobs we still show the the economy losing
[1:43:17.040 --> 1:43:20.160]  i think it was eighty five thousand jobs we had an upper revision of four
[1:43:20.160 --> 1:43:21.920]  thousand in the prior month
[1:43:21.920 --> 1:43:24.600]  uh... we need to create a create
[1:43:24.600 --> 1:43:25.800]  a minimum
[1:43:25.800 --> 1:43:28.600]  of a hundred thousand new jobs every single month
[1:43:28.600 --> 1:43:32.320]  just to keep up with the growth of our population in the united states
[1:43:32.320 --> 1:43:35.560]  and it's not as bad as it was at seven hundred thousand lost in jobs last
[1:43:35.560 --> 1:43:36.480]  january
[1:43:36.480 --> 1:43:39.720]  but we're still losing jobs there's a critical issue the job situation is
[1:43:39.720 --> 1:43:41.200]  pretty pretty
[1:43:41.200 --> 1:43:42.440]  pretty serious
[1:43:42.440 --> 1:43:46.680]  on the stock market the trend does appear to be up though however here
[1:43:46.680 --> 1:43:48.880]  even with all this bad news
[1:43:48.880 --> 1:43:51.000]  equities appear to be rising
[1:43:51.000 --> 1:43:54.000]  uh... so the stock market actually looking pretty good
[1:43:54.000 --> 1:43:58.680]  on uh... interest rates bonds we don't like bonds because
[1:43:58.680 --> 1:44:02.200]  rates alix but they're they're near zero and in fact two weeks ago the
[1:44:02.200 --> 1:44:03.720]  treasury did an auction
[1:44:03.720 --> 1:44:06.600]  where they convinced people and succeeded
[1:44:06.600 --> 1:44:10.320]  in selling them bonds with zero percent interest
[1:44:10.320 --> 1:44:11.760]  that's crazy
[1:44:11.760 --> 1:44:16.040]  the last place you want to be is an impond when interest rates are this low
[1:44:16.040 --> 1:44:18.680]  gold continues to look good we own gold
[1:44:18.680 --> 1:44:23.200]  oil continues to look good we own oil and oils climb from sixty-eight to eighty
[1:44:23.200 --> 1:44:24.920]  three dollars a barrel
[1:44:24.920 --> 1:44:28.160]  on since i think i i was on the air with you where do you think oil's going
[1:44:28.160 --> 1:44:30.760]  and what's gonna happen with natural gas
[1:44:30.760 --> 1:44:34.240]  like i think you know that i want to take the first part of uh... the first
[1:44:34.240 --> 1:44:38.640]  part of that first of all take the the natural gas disaster second
[1:44:38.640 --> 1:44:42.560]  uh... the uh... oil looks like it's headed higher a lot of that's tied to the
[1:44:42.560 --> 1:44:43.400]  dollar
[1:44:43.400 --> 1:44:46.640]  on the you know we can see ninety hundred dollar oil
[1:44:46.640 --> 1:44:49.520]  uh... in the next twelve months i think that's possible
[1:44:49.520 --> 1:44:52.320]  uh... uh... it but we'll see
[1:44:52.320 --> 1:44:57.120]  uh... in terms of uh... natural gas you know it's just uh... the trend on
[1:44:57.120 --> 1:44:59.680]  natural gas alex has just been
[1:44:59.680 --> 1:45:01.280]  the bottomless pit
[1:45:01.280 --> 1:45:05.480]  and it was seemingly cheap at every point the way that along the way down
[1:45:05.480 --> 1:45:07.840]  but the natural gas is like city group
[1:45:07.840 --> 1:45:09.360]  i mean it was different fifty
[1:45:09.360 --> 1:45:14.480]  it seemed cheap at twenty five for a hit fifteen and ten and five and three
[1:45:14.480 --> 1:45:18.160]  and uh... ninety-seven cents and natural gas has been kind of trending like that
[1:45:18.160 --> 1:45:19.320]  however
[1:45:19.320 --> 1:45:23.000]  you do have the uh... the feel-good uh... environmentalist uh...
[1:45:23.000 --> 1:45:26.680]  saying that uh... they'd love to see the world more uh... power with natural gas
[1:45:26.680 --> 1:45:28.320]  including people in pickings
[1:45:28.320 --> 1:45:31.600]  but um... it has not materialized in prices so
[1:45:31.600 --> 1:45:36.280]  all i can say about natural gas is the trend is still down
[1:45:36.280 --> 1:45:38.080]  okay um...
[1:45:38.080 --> 1:45:42.480]  and again your company is nine points capital partners the website is n p
[1:45:42.480 --> 1:45:46.160]  m dot u s damon vickers is our guest i want to go to calls
[1:45:46.160 --> 1:45:49.640]  in the time we have left but so much is going on the world
[1:45:49.640 --> 1:45:54.320]  uh... what do you think about the underwear bomber situation if you see
[1:45:54.320 --> 1:45:55.600]  the evidence of that
[1:45:55.600 --> 1:45:58.200]  being a hoax to launch the body scanners
[1:45:58.200 --> 1:46:01.080]  well what do you what what do you think of uh...
[1:46:01.080 --> 1:46:05.480]  what's happening with iran with yemen all these talks of expanding wars
[1:46:05.480 --> 1:46:08.840]  when when empires get in trouble they like to launch new wars
[1:46:08.840 --> 1:46:11.560]  they do you're right and it's good for the currencies to
[1:46:11.560 --> 1:46:15.200]  because uh... if you get a if you get a flight to uh... flight to perceive
[1:46:15.200 --> 1:46:17.400]  safety because of global instability
[1:46:17.400 --> 1:46:18.800]  uh... well
[1:46:18.800 --> 1:46:23.400]  uh... in terms of body scanners my gosh uh... uh... i don't know i don't i don't
[1:46:23.400 --> 1:46:26.280]  think it's particularly effective against p e p m
[1:46:26.280 --> 1:46:28.760]  which is the main thing they're mostly worried about the right i mean it
[1:46:28.760 --> 1:46:30.680]  doesn't it nothing really good
[1:46:30.680 --> 1:46:32.680]  can can spot p e p m
[1:46:32.680 --> 1:46:36.560]  but it's a good if you're a gas it which is an ingredient found in urine
[1:46:36.560 --> 1:46:39.880]  uh... and uh... and something else however you think they'd be able to
[1:46:39.880 --> 1:46:44.040]  put it for it if there are a lot of great
[1:46:44.040 --> 1:46:47.600]  but in my case alex i think that the alarm would go up every time okay
[1:46:47.600 --> 1:46:51.960]  uh... let's see uh... as for the body scanners i mean i don't know i mean it
[1:46:51.960 --> 1:46:55.360]  it would be pretty nervous though alex i mean i i i i mean i do you have any
[1:46:55.360 --> 1:46:57.160]  concern about the possibility i mean
[1:46:57.160 --> 1:47:00.760]  do you want to uh... them to try to do everything they can to try to keep people
[1:47:00.760 --> 1:47:01.600]  from uh...
[1:47:01.600 --> 1:47:04.960]  doing stupid things like uh... blowout patches in airplanes if you're on the
[1:47:04.960 --> 1:47:09.000]  airplane uh... jamon we can't give up our whole way of life because somebody
[1:47:09.000 --> 1:47:10.680]  might blow up an airplane
[1:47:10.680 --> 1:47:13.360]  uh... the body scanners wouldn't even protect it against that has all the
[1:47:13.360 --> 1:47:14.720]  earmarks of being
[1:47:14.720 --> 1:47:18.680]  a staged event i don't want to march my daughters or your daughters
[1:47:18.680 --> 1:47:21.960]  through the naked body scanners that are recorded and saved by the government
[1:47:21.960 --> 1:47:25.040]  so they can then have your biometric i d and scan you from a distance they've
[1:47:25.040 --> 1:47:28.080]  now admitted today that is what they're planning
[1:47:28.080 --> 1:47:31.240]  let's talk about that for a second the biometrics and this is an area that
[1:47:31.240 --> 1:47:34.200]  that we've been involved with that you know over the years
[1:47:34.200 --> 1:47:36.080]  and that the the interface
[1:47:36.080 --> 1:47:39.080]  the the human interface
[1:47:39.080 --> 1:47:40.040]  person
[1:47:40.040 --> 1:47:41.320]  and machine
[1:47:41.320 --> 1:47:43.880]  is disintegrating that
[1:47:43.880 --> 1:47:46.000]  rapid fast rate
[1:47:46.000 --> 1:47:51.880]  that uh... that uh... uh... uh... you we are we're likely to have
[1:47:51.880 --> 1:47:53.080]  uh... this
[1:47:53.080 --> 1:47:57.160]  the rfid and the chip arrival of the tracking of human being that
[1:47:57.160 --> 1:48:01.200]  that's likely to really continue to have to accelerate i would say that
[1:48:01.200 --> 1:48:02.600]  the next couple years
[1:48:02.600 --> 1:48:06.200]  uh... it's just that much more efficient to track people but we need to say no
[1:48:06.200 --> 1:48:09.720]  to this because we do not have a loving global corporate system
[1:48:09.720 --> 1:48:12.200]  these are predators for my research
[1:48:12.200 --> 1:48:13.320]  right right
[1:48:13.320 --> 1:48:16.840]  well um... i'm not sure the government what what you can do ultimately about
[1:48:16.840 --> 1:48:20.520]  people's independent free will and i guess that's where you need those uh...
[1:48:20.520 --> 1:48:23.800]  those uh... those thought scanners to uh... the kick in
[1:48:23.800 --> 1:48:27.040]  and uh... permanent from an investment standpoint at their probably some
[1:48:27.040 --> 1:48:28.240]  investors that would
[1:48:28.240 --> 1:48:32.440]  love to see it an investment cycle in such an industry because we've
[1:48:32.440 --> 1:48:36.360]  personally had it but i could invest with bank robbers during the last ten
[1:48:36.360 --> 1:48:37.280]  years
[1:48:37.280 --> 1:48:39.080]  so uh... uh...
[1:48:39.080 --> 1:48:39.960]  so i don't know
[1:48:39.960 --> 1:48:42.840]  but then i could invest with bank robbers and get a big return
[1:48:42.840 --> 1:48:45.040]  and we have to be moral about this
[1:48:45.040 --> 1:48:46.240]  i mean here's an example
[1:48:46.240 --> 1:48:49.160]  federal government raw story reports
[1:48:49.160 --> 1:48:53.720]  twelve percent of kids sexually abused by the government in custody
[1:48:53.720 --> 1:48:57.840]  i mean the government is filled statistically with more scum
[1:48:57.840 --> 1:49:02.960]  we've got t s a running around having delusional breakdown saying they're god in
[1:49:02.960 --> 1:49:06.600]  i mean the uh... big government always hurts people
[1:49:06.600 --> 1:49:09.360]  i i i can't disagree with the fact that
[1:49:09.360 --> 1:49:12.760]  uh... a high percentage of people that find themselves
[1:49:12.760 --> 1:49:15.000]  uh... desirous to be quote
[1:49:15.000 --> 1:49:18.280]  corrections officers and or police
[1:49:18.280 --> 1:49:21.000]  have a uh... uh... sadistic
[1:49:21.000 --> 1:49:22.680]  up and perhaps
[1:49:22.680 --> 1:49:26.720]  and uh... uh... uh... and that's why they pursue jobs like that
[1:49:26.720 --> 1:49:29.960]  and i think that's what we do and that's taught in criminology the police know
[1:49:29.960 --> 1:49:30.680]  that
[1:49:30.680 --> 1:49:34.960]  about themselves and but the public stock to the culture oh no
[1:49:34.960 --> 1:49:38.760]  the police aren't sadistic and and you need to let them just run wild and do
[1:49:38.760 --> 1:49:42.720]  whatever they want and keep us safe from underwear bombers
[1:49:42.720 --> 1:49:44.640]  most of the world is asleep
[1:49:44.640 --> 1:49:46.600]  most of the world is not awake
[1:49:46.600 --> 1:49:50.840]  most of the people medicate themselves on on on bad guy i don't know the
[1:49:50.840 --> 1:49:56.840]  opinion exactly the world is asleep you're trying to wake people up but to
[1:49:56.840 --> 1:50:00.400]  really wake people up it mostly takes a bet
[1:50:00.400 --> 1:50:03.840]  because people are spectators and most people are not independent thinkers
[1:50:03.840 --> 1:50:08.480]  alex and most of the global population will never be made up of people that
[1:50:08.480 --> 1:50:13.240]  are independent thinkers most people on the planet are followers and they are
[1:50:13.240 --> 1:50:17.320]  sheep and this is what i always hear always a lot of followers and this is
[1:50:17.320 --> 1:50:20.120]  what i always hear from high-powered people like you grew up
[1:50:20.120 --> 1:50:21.880]  around the Rockefellers and people
[1:50:21.880 --> 1:50:26.040]  i through life have run into a lot of these people and they'll say they'll say
[1:50:26.040 --> 1:50:29.480]  off record the people are slaves they want to be slaves all you can do is
[1:50:29.480 --> 1:50:33.240]  protect yourself mr. jones and you ought to join us because the horde of people
[1:50:33.240 --> 1:50:37.200]  out there want to tear you apart but that's the rationale to then do all
[1:50:37.200 --> 1:50:41.200]  these evil things because just because the general public's evil doesn't mean
[1:50:41.200 --> 1:50:43.080]  that i have to become evil
[1:50:43.080 --> 1:50:47.800]  agreed agreed and we should we should choose light over darkness
[1:50:47.800 --> 1:50:50.840]  well we're certainly not seeing that from the establishment i see darkness a
[1:50:50.840 --> 1:50:52.200]  lot worse from them
[1:50:52.200 --> 1:50:55.880]  than from the thumb-sucking baby public that wants a big daddy to take care of
[1:50:55.880 --> 1:50:56.320]  them

[1:54:26.120 --> 1:54:29.720]  hi alex my question is a little bit off the wall for your topic that you've
[1:54:29.720 --> 1:54:34.200]  been speaking about but i'm curious to find out if you've heard on the 26th
[1:54:34.200 --> 1:54:37.800]  of this month of obama having to report his
[1:54:37.800 --> 1:54:41.880]  first certificate to a federal court no i haven't heard about that sam and i
[1:54:41.880 --> 1:54:45.560]  appreciate your call i mean i think
[1:54:45.560 --> 1:54:48.680]  i think there's something to it it should be investigated but at the same
[1:54:48.680 --> 1:54:51.480]  time he's lied about everything he's a puppet
[1:54:51.480 --> 1:54:56.840]  it's a distraction lobbyist torture secrecy wars i mean
[1:54:56.840 --> 1:55:00.200]  we've got to start worrying about the next puppet they're putting in
[1:55:00.200 --> 1:55:04.200]  let's agree that that's what my films fall the republic try to do an obama
[1:55:04.200 --> 1:55:08.440]  deception is show the stupid left you're being manipulated same with the right
[1:55:08.440 --> 1:55:10.680]  wing right wingers by the video and think they're
[1:55:10.680 --> 1:55:14.280]  going to find out about how evil obama is left wingers see it thinking it's an
[1:55:14.280 --> 1:55:17.400]  obama basher and they actually find out they've been bamboozled
[1:55:17.400 --> 1:55:21.720]  that's the whole point they find out it's all a scam it's all a scam
[1:55:21.720 --> 1:55:25.320]  let's talk to john in texas you're on the air go ahead
[1:55:25.320 --> 1:55:29.240]  good afternoon ten-year listener just get these quick points out of the way my
[1:55:29.240 --> 1:55:32.520]  perspective is is a little unique because i come from uh
[1:55:32.520 --> 1:55:35.800]  my father was an air force intelligence for 18 years
[1:55:35.800 --> 1:55:39.480]  stationed in philippines colorado springs work for nsa and
[1:55:39.480 --> 1:55:42.520]  just traveling around the country selling here in austin
[1:55:42.520 --> 1:55:46.280]  uh what i did realize is after listening to you especially that there is
[1:55:46.280 --> 1:55:49.960]  something more going on and what i would like to say is if we utilize the
[1:55:49.960 --> 1:55:54.040]  blessings of advanced technology to improve and sustain the lives of the
[1:55:54.040 --> 1:55:58.200]  whole population there's water generators solar power generators
[1:55:58.200 --> 1:56:01.640]  can help bring fresh water electricity to the poor that's right with the elite
[1:56:01.640 --> 1:56:04.760]  are suppressing a lot of that and creating monopolies for their own
[1:56:04.760 --> 1:56:07.800]  power let's let's get comments from david vickers on this
[1:56:07.800 --> 1:56:12.520]  well i i i i i don't think you need to bring any more water to the poor
[1:56:12.520 --> 1:56:17.080]  any uh uh to mitigate their suffering because i believe you compounded
[1:56:17.080 --> 1:56:21.320]  there will always be a large to the global population that is poor
[1:56:21.320 --> 1:56:25.720]  of the have not there will always be and at the extent that we we've stepped in
[1:56:25.720 --> 1:56:29.000]  and done that um we've created more problems and
[1:56:29.000 --> 1:56:32.840]  these and more warfare and all you have to stop right there that is exactly
[1:56:32.840 --> 1:56:38.920]  in our dark four and see the horror and tragedy of our goodwill
[1:56:38.920 --> 1:56:43.000]  david that's exactly what the globalists say cut off their resources don't give
[1:56:43.000 --> 1:56:47.080]  them new resources because it makes them have more kids when the real
[1:56:47.080 --> 1:56:50.920]  resources i would say don't be in leave it alone leave well enough
[1:56:50.920 --> 1:56:54.760]  alone let their cultures and their civil relations
[1:56:54.760 --> 1:56:58.920]  evolve and progress naturally that's what he's saying let them have the
[1:56:58.920 --> 1:57:01.880]  technology chickens to be happy that's what i'm saying
[1:57:01.880 --> 1:57:05.800]  let them have the technology damon wants somebody gets industrialized don't
[1:57:05.800 --> 1:57:09.000]  know how to operate it leave it alone let them let
[1:57:09.000 --> 1:57:12.520]  leave them be in their primitive societies and no advance along their own
[1:57:12.520 --> 1:57:16.840]  course so they won't but maybe it takes a couple thousand years leave them alone
[1:57:16.840 --> 1:57:20.680]  that's what i would say but when you leave them alone they have even more
[1:57:20.680 --> 1:57:24.440]  kids no they don't because you can only run
[1:57:24.440 --> 1:57:29.000]  so fast away from the lions you can't take ten kids and run away from the
[1:57:29.000 --> 1:57:32.120]  and the hoarding hyenas or else they're gonna be eaten
[1:57:32.120 --> 1:57:36.360]  that's the population was in balance this sounds like social Darwinism
[1:57:36.360 --> 1:57:40.520]  vickers okay well well
[1:57:40.520 --> 1:57:44.440]  i think i think uh i think nature had a had a had a had there was a lot more
[1:57:44.440 --> 1:57:48.440]  balance in places like africa and south america before very malphusian they
[1:57:48.440 --> 1:57:51.640]  said that in the 1750s i disagree with you
[1:57:51.640 --> 1:57:55.000]  john anything else to damon vickers two quick points
[1:57:55.000 --> 1:57:59.080]  uh okay if you take a flight from austin to denver colorado
[1:57:59.080 --> 1:58:02.840]  and you're a few thousand feet up you can see and realize how big
[1:58:02.840 --> 1:58:06.280]  our world really is so so overpopulation is a joke
[1:58:06.280 --> 1:58:09.800]  and now in my opinion there's a genocide against global middle class
[1:58:09.800 --> 1:58:13.800]  especially against the us here and that's why i plan on running as a rep for
[1:58:13.800 --> 1:58:18.520]  texas state district 46 against donna duke's and other corrupt officials
[1:58:18.520 --> 1:58:21.240]  because that's where it starts he's got to end it there

[2:00:22.920 --> 2:00:28.280]  austin texas alex jones the global engineers
[2:00:28.280 --> 2:00:32.680]  are not leaving the third world alone they're there buying off their politicians
[2:00:32.680 --> 2:00:37.240]  we have this the state department ran of 200 by kissinger
[2:00:37.240 --> 2:00:42.520]  starting wars starting famines to try to reduce their numbers
[2:00:42.520 --> 2:00:48.520]  i say industrialism educate them and their numbers will plane off even if
[2:00:48.520 --> 2:00:52.200]  you believe the world's overpopulated i believe a lot of our technologies are
[2:00:52.200 --> 2:00:55.400]  overpopulating toxins and poisons
[2:00:55.400 --> 2:00:58.920]  it's like the environmentalist in europe are saying we want gmo
[2:00:58.920 --> 2:01:03.800]  to combat global warming it's all made up damon what do you think of the uh
[2:01:03.800 --> 2:01:07.400]  the copenhagen situation blowing up in their face
[2:01:07.400 --> 2:01:11.000]  that was pretty clever on the the releases were were pretty good to
[2:01:11.000 --> 2:01:14.680]  counter uh to counter the uh the greenhouse warming
[2:01:14.680 --> 2:01:19.560]  i mean in a in a uh in a larger context everything that happens on the planet
[2:01:19.560 --> 2:01:23.640]  is natural including pollution because it all comes from here
[2:01:23.640 --> 2:01:27.960]  but uh we may or may not have operated processes that are
[2:01:27.960 --> 2:01:31.640]  that are they're acting against us i don't think you can dispute the fact
[2:01:31.640 --> 2:01:35.000]  that there's you know increasingly there are large segments of the world that
[2:01:35.000 --> 2:01:40.120]  are being polluted by our activities of the lakes and the rivers and streams or
[2:01:40.120 --> 2:01:43.720]  but they're not doing anything about that it's all about carbon dioxide
[2:01:43.720 --> 2:01:49.080]  uh let's go ahead and talk to eon in new york eon you're on the air
[2:01:49.080 --> 2:01:55.080]  yes a good afternoon alec welcome uh i'm this guy you gotta show your guest he
[2:01:55.080 --> 2:01:59.240]  appears to be a globalist because he has all the earmuffs of the globalist
[2:01:59.240 --> 2:02:04.920]  he's talking about the third world and uh how they are just uh irresponsible
[2:02:04.920 --> 2:02:08.360]  that's not the case well i i human beings in
[2:02:08.360 --> 2:02:12.360]  generally irresponsible i i don't think it's just the third world
[2:02:12.360 --> 2:02:16.680]  i think it's all of us a large segment of the third third world was
[2:02:16.680 --> 2:02:20.360]  westernized too soon and the consequences have been imbalanced
[2:02:20.360 --> 2:02:24.200]  globally but damon aren't you openly saying that global
[2:02:24.200 --> 2:02:28.920]  government is going to be the solution to what you believe is over population
[2:02:28.920 --> 2:02:32.440]  i think global government will ultimately be the solution that the world
[2:02:32.440 --> 2:02:38.200]  chooses as as a uh desire to uh to solve its
[2:02:38.200 --> 2:02:42.120]  problems well that's why we have you here because the individual states and
[2:02:42.120 --> 2:02:47.240]  countries will have to surrender a large part of their
[2:02:47.240 --> 2:02:51.560]  free will and quote your term sovereignty to a global government because the
[2:02:51.560 --> 2:02:55.800]  bankers set up internal banking scams to take them over
[2:02:55.800 --> 2:03:00.920]  i don't know i to carry out the saving of the earth
[2:03:00.920 --> 2:03:04.440]  well i i they may not have anything to do with the earth it may have to do with
[2:03:04.440 --> 2:03:08.040]  debt and i think it's more likely to be around debt and currencies than it is
[2:03:08.040 --> 2:03:11.560]  that but i mean sure they may coming in a number a number of different angles
[2:03:11.560 --> 2:03:15.800]  probably does give you uh advantages to have a plan a or a plan b
[2:03:15.800 --> 2:03:18.680]  i suppose beyond anything else sir from new york
[2:03:18.680 --> 2:03:23.640]  yes sir um i believe that is why why westernize everybody let people be
[2:03:23.640 --> 2:03:26.360]  alone that they respect their cultures
[2:03:26.360 --> 2:03:31.080]  agree let them evolve on their own i totally agree i totally agree
[2:03:31.080 --> 2:03:34.680]  but the globalists aren't doing that the the the world government's coming in
[2:03:34.680 --> 2:03:38.120]  and taking them over you just said countries had to give up their sovereignty
[2:03:38.120 --> 2:03:42.520]  i countries will likely have to give up some of their sovereignty in order to be
[2:03:42.520 --> 2:03:46.680]  salvaged basically but in terms of individualized cultures no individualized
[2:03:46.680 --> 2:03:50.360]  cultures should definitely be preserved well the average third worlders
[2:03:50.360 --> 2:03:53.080]  having four children they're not having 25
[2:03:53.080 --> 2:03:56.440]  yeah there's not much culture left in a lot of the third world is just utter
[2:03:56.440 --> 2:04:00.920]  poverty and despair and tragedy suffering
[2:04:00.920 --> 2:04:06.520]  that tragedy and for poverty and suffering were brought to them
[2:04:06.520 --> 2:04:12.120]  any place that was invaded and after the aftermath is always poverty and
[2:04:12.120 --> 2:04:16.840]  suffering not always Europe wasn't the case but in the in the case of of the
[2:04:16.840 --> 2:04:21.880]  third world in africa yes the arrival of westernized man into those areas
[2:04:21.880 --> 2:04:25.480]  was utterly tragic well here's the deal damon you know you
[2:04:25.480 --> 2:04:28.680]  i mean you know the big new brazilian you said when you were a kid you know him
[2:04:28.680 --> 2:04:32.520]  he brags in a book how we funded poll but i did not know i did not know i didn't
[2:04:32.520 --> 2:04:36.440]  i know i i've i've met him i didn't i didn't i didn't okay you've met him the
[2:04:36.440 --> 2:04:40.040]  point is he had this different thing that you do them no no i understand i was
[2:04:40.040 --> 2:04:43.960]  trying to finish up and saying that's somebody who you've met somebody we've
[2:04:43.960 --> 2:04:48.280]  confronted the point is is that kissinger said in 73 they were
[2:04:48.280 --> 2:04:51.320]  going to use war and famine to control the third world
[2:04:51.320 --> 2:04:55.480]  i mean i i mean we know this we know this group is not friendly

[2:07:07.160 --> 2:07:10.840]  power generator number one new climate legislation could easily
[2:07:10.840 --> 2:07:14.920]  double or triple your electric bill number two our new energy czar wants to
[2:07:14.920 --> 2:07:18.200]  control how much power your electric company allows you to have
[2:07:18.200 --> 2:07:22.440]  it's true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid
[2:07:22.440 --> 2:07:26.040]  technology is coming number three in some areas of the country
[2:07:26.040 --> 2:07:30.520]  the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation
[2:07:30.520 --> 2:07:34.360]  is only compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a
[2:07:34.360 --> 2:07:37.560]  threat to local grids every year thousands of families lose
[2:07:37.560 --> 2:07:41.480]  their power from weather related onages number five a solar power generator

[2:08:04.920 --> 2:08:12.680]  ease the t-rex of political talk alex jones on the gcn radio network
[2:08:17.560 --> 2:08:22.840]  what's really going on is the globalist wreck the third world
[2:08:23.480 --> 2:08:26.440]  which isn't hard to do they play different tribal groups off against each
[2:08:26.440 --> 2:08:30.760]  other this is in their own documents we've listed here
[2:08:30.760 --> 2:08:36.200]  they then export large portions of the third world population
[2:08:36.200 --> 2:08:42.600]  to the first world get them on welfare through multiculturalism
[2:08:42.600 --> 2:08:47.880]  turn them against the domestic population and use the imported poor to
[2:08:47.880 --> 2:08:51.320]  wage war against the middle class then the
[2:08:51.320 --> 2:08:56.040]  illegal aliens become legal they pull the lever to disarm the population
[2:08:56.040 --> 2:08:59.320]  to rob the population thinking they're going to get some of the booty
[2:08:59.320 --> 2:09:03.560]  it's then given to the central banks and we saw this with copenhagen where they
[2:09:03.560 --> 2:09:07.000]  promised western money for the third world but really it was take the west
[2:09:07.000 --> 2:09:10.600]  money to take the third world's money and give it to the banks
[2:09:10.600 --> 2:09:14.840]  this is how the game is worked pressure from below and above
[2:09:14.840 --> 2:09:18.440]  bob Chapman of the international forecaster.com
[2:09:18.440 --> 2:09:21.640]  financial expert fighting the globalists for more than 45
[2:09:21.640 --> 2:09:25.960]  years he joins us now he heard the tail end of damon vickers
[2:09:25.960 --> 2:09:29.320]  and you know i have damon on because he really believes what he's doing is good
[2:09:29.320 --> 2:09:32.200]  he really believes this global government is coming and that that's
[2:09:32.200 --> 2:09:35.320]  pretty much what's needed and when you talk to globalist
[2:09:35.320 --> 2:09:39.160]  and he's a pretty high-powered guy they really believe they're right they
[2:09:39.160 --> 2:09:42.760]  really believe this is good at that upper-mid level
[2:09:42.760 --> 2:09:48.920]  that he inhabits and so we have him on so people can hear it from them
[2:09:48.920 --> 2:09:52.360]  here i mean that's why we had roth cop the head of the kissinger group on
[2:09:52.360 --> 2:09:58.200]  so you can hear it from them okay and you know i don't think damon is a
[2:09:58.200 --> 2:10:02.280]  evil person i think he in his own ways is being an
[2:10:02.280 --> 2:10:07.320]  opportunist to play both sides of it to position himself well as he said
[2:10:07.320 --> 2:10:10.680]  and i asked bob Chapman who didn't hear the interview he's heard the last five
[2:10:10.680 --> 2:10:14.440]  minutes on hold what he thought he said i think that guy's an opportunist
[2:10:14.440 --> 2:10:17.800]  and that's pretty much what vickers says he says that's all we can be
[2:10:17.800 --> 2:10:22.840]  so that's kind of that worldview of just assess the way things are and go with
[2:10:22.840 --> 2:10:25.480]  that no i'm going to assess the world
[2:10:25.480 --> 2:10:29.480]  and try to change it for good as long as i don't violate other people's rights
[2:10:29.480 --> 2:10:32.680]  liberty or property but your take on population then we're
[2:10:32.680 --> 2:10:37.240]  going to get into the copenhagen situation lawsuits being filed
[2:10:37.240 --> 2:10:40.120]  against the fraudsters what's happening with the economy what's happening with
[2:10:40.120 --> 2:10:43.960]  the dollar with gold with bob Chapman and we'll continue with your phone calls
[2:10:43.960 --> 2:10:47.160]  as well in this hour bob Chapman
[2:10:47.160 --> 2:10:49.720]  you hadn't been with us for three weeks because of the holidays good to have you
[2:10:49.720 --> 2:10:54.200]  back with us well thank you very much it's great to be here
[2:10:54.200 --> 2:11:00.280]  and um i don't think in the future populations really going to be a problem
[2:11:00.280 --> 2:11:04.760]  and population as you've said before is going to level off
[2:11:04.760 --> 2:11:07.640]  and it'll be a natural occurrence of events
[2:11:07.640 --> 2:11:11.960]  uh... this country that you can go to our neighbor like mexico everybody used
[2:11:11.960 --> 2:11:14.200]  to have five six seven eight children
[2:11:14.200 --> 2:11:19.640]  uh... immigrants who came to america uh... particularly from uh...
[2:11:19.640 --> 2:11:23.960]  italy is an example an arland they used to have lots of children
[2:11:23.960 --> 2:11:27.800]  uh... instead of having three or four five six
[2:11:27.800 --> 2:11:32.520]  now families are having two maybe one and a half
[2:11:32.520 --> 2:11:37.240]  and that's happening uh... in most societies that want to advance they
[2:11:37.240 --> 2:11:41.320]  realize that it's a handful
[2:11:41.320 --> 2:11:45.560]  paying for and clothing and making sure
[2:11:45.560 --> 2:11:48.920]  that the children get the best education possible so they can be
[2:11:48.920 --> 2:11:52.600]  successful in life so it's happening all over the world and i
[2:11:52.600 --> 2:11:57.960]  i think in some sections of the third world it might continue to be a problem
[2:11:57.960 --> 2:12:01.640]  uh... uh... more of a problem than it is elsewhere
[2:12:01.640 --> 2:12:05.640]  but we certainly don't have forced abortions and nerve gas people and put
[2:12:05.640 --> 2:12:08.840]  bio weapons in there which they've been doing
[2:12:08.840 --> 2:12:12.120]  that's right net that's tragic and it shouldn't be in
[2:12:12.120 --> 2:12:15.800]  and uh... and it was just like this h one b one
[2:12:15.800 --> 2:12:20.840]  uh... scam after scam after scam i think my point that they're exporting
[2:12:20.840 --> 2:12:25.480]  third world populations to use them as weapons against the west
[2:12:25.480 --> 2:12:30.120]  absolutely and europe is a perfect example
[2:12:30.120 --> 2:12:34.360]  the muslim population moving out of the middle east and northern africa
[2:12:34.360 --> 2:12:39.160]  at uh... you know there's a mosque on every count uh... on every corner so to
[2:12:39.160 --> 2:12:42.120]  speak and a number of people
[2:12:42.120 --> 2:12:47.000]  uh... who have never spoken about the issue before in public
[2:12:47.000 --> 2:12:52.200]  uh... for record uh... even uh... so cozy in france
[2:12:52.200 --> 2:12:56.120]  who certainly not a racist racist of any kind says we gotta do something about
[2:12:56.120 --> 2:13:00.760]  this problem france is dying and france is dying
[2:13:00.760 --> 2:13:04.600]  england is dying there are more brits leaving england every year that are
[2:13:04.600 --> 2:13:09.080]  born there the west is dying there is no doubt
[2:13:09.080 --> 2:13:12.600]  well that's true and if the amalgamation of people
[2:13:12.600 --> 2:13:16.920]  of which at least religiously in europe is untenable
[2:13:16.920 --> 2:13:21.400]  if it's only a matter of time uh... before this clashes
[2:13:21.400 --> 2:13:25.240]  and the muslims tend to have more children and europe they have about
[2:13:25.240 --> 2:13:29.160]  one and a half children per couple and uh... i don't know what the number of
[2:13:29.160 --> 2:13:32.520]  muslims are but i i think it's probably three
[2:13:32.520 --> 2:13:38.440]  maybe even more and uh... and so the attitude is totally different
[2:13:38.440 --> 2:13:45.480]  the the cultural uh... uh... the thing that goes on inside their society
[2:13:45.480 --> 2:13:49.320]  and the muslims is totally different than the history of uh...
[2:13:49.320 --> 2:13:55.720]  uh... indio indo european culture and so you gotta have a clash it's not good
[2:13:55.720 --> 2:14:01.160]  but instead we have the bbc calling for carbon rationing of food to everyone
[2:14:01.160 --> 2:14:05.080]  and cutting the west down to one child you have this
[2:14:05.080 --> 2:14:09.880]  hatred by the liberal intelligentsia of the west they relish the fact the west
[2:14:09.880 --> 2:14:13.160]  is dying they celebrate it when i was in college
[2:14:13.160 --> 2:14:17.560]  i was alerted to this enemy because they celebrated the death of the west
[2:14:17.560 --> 2:14:22.680]  uh... these are truly self-hating people
[2:14:22.680 --> 2:14:26.760]  i think you're absolutely right and i you know there's something
[2:14:26.760 --> 2:14:32.600]  intrinsically wrong with people who want to amalgamate people
[2:14:32.600 --> 2:14:37.160]  and and and put them into serfdom and have this
[2:14:37.160 --> 2:14:42.840]  so-called intelligentsia that knows better than the public does what's good
[2:14:42.840 --> 2:14:46.360]  for them and this is this whole concept
[2:14:46.360 --> 2:14:51.160]  uh... we are the leadership and we know well i get news for them
[2:14:51.160 --> 2:14:54.280]  there's millions of people who are just as smart as they are throughout the
[2:14:54.280 --> 2:14:57.480]  entire world and they're not going to let them do this
[2:14:57.480 --> 2:15:01.720]  it's wrong it's unnatural and to force people
[2:15:01.720 --> 2:15:05.880]  to become members of the new world order or force people
[2:15:05.880 --> 2:15:10.040]  not to have children it's not natural it it's wrong
[2:15:10.040 --> 2:15:15.720]  well they only allow the immigrant populations to have their racial identity
[2:15:15.720 --> 2:15:19.160]  and the ford foundation others globally fund
[2:15:19.160 --> 2:15:23.320]  hatred of the west but that's only because in this stage of the game
[2:15:23.320 --> 2:15:28.120]  the controllers the intelligentsia are directing these giant hordes of people
[2:15:28.120 --> 2:15:32.760]  as weapons here's the new york times immigrants riot in italy amid racial
[2:15:32.760 --> 2:15:35.640]  unrest thousands of immigrants protested against
[2:15:35.640 --> 2:15:39.800]  racism when it's africa that's invaded italy over and over again
[2:15:39.800 --> 2:15:44.120]  in the southern italian town on friday after a night of rioting
[2:15:44.120 --> 2:15:47.480]  in one of italy's worst episodes of racial unrest in years
[2:15:47.480 --> 2:15:51.960]  dozens of africans uh... in several cities smashed car windows with steel
[2:15:51.960 --> 2:15:55.800]  bars stones and set cars and rubbish bins on fire
[2:15:55.800 --> 2:15:59.800]  police said at least one car was attacked by passengers inside several of whom
[2:15:59.800 --> 2:16:03.000]  were injured we have racial attacks this is going on
[2:16:03.000 --> 2:16:06.680]  everywhere but it's always loving oh they're just striking back against
[2:16:06.680 --> 2:16:09.640]  evil no they're brought in they're put on welfare
[2:16:09.640 --> 2:16:14.120]  their position is weapons systems and again in europe they'll play two eastern
[2:16:14.120 --> 2:16:17.880]  countries whites off against each other in africa they'll play two
[2:16:17.880 --> 2:16:20.680]  african tribes off in latin america they'll
[2:16:20.680 --> 2:16:23.960]  uh... play two different groups off against each other
[2:16:23.960 --> 2:16:29.400]  it's simple divide and conquer i think you're absolutely right
[2:16:29.400 --> 2:16:35.000]  and i lived in africa uh... those sort of things were not going on at that time
[2:16:35.000 --> 2:16:39.240]  uh... at least in zimbabwe in south africa where i lived
[2:16:39.240 --> 2:16:45.800]  uh... but uh... since then and that was thirty years ago uh... since then
[2:16:45.800 --> 2:16:49.960]  uh... the situation is trained dramatic dramatic change dramatically
[2:16:49.960 --> 2:16:54.600]  and you're right about the uh... the genocide that goes on
[2:16:54.600 --> 2:16:58.600]  and uh... it uh... this is to control
[2:16:58.600 --> 2:17:04.040]  uh... you know when the western powers were in africa
[2:17:04.040 --> 2:17:08.280]  they totally controlled everything because they took the countries over
[2:17:08.280 --> 2:17:12.200]  then they decided well what we're going to do now is we're going to pull out
[2:17:12.200 --> 2:17:15.640]  let them have their own government but we'll still control them
[2:17:15.640 --> 2:17:19.880]  and that's what's going on today only the africans don't realize that
[2:17:19.880 --> 2:17:23.400]  they're not that sophisticated so that's the old british model
[2:17:23.400 --> 2:17:28.200]  of take your flag down but control your puppets and the people will take
[2:17:28.200 --> 2:17:34.600]  ten times the abuse absolutely absolutely that's the way it works
[2:17:34.600 --> 2:17:39.480]  you know the the british uh... with the largest colonizers in africa
[2:17:39.480 --> 2:17:45.560]  and uh... they did bring law order development
[2:17:45.560 --> 2:17:48.520]  and they took that piece of the action as well
[2:17:48.520 --> 2:17:52.280]  but you know what having lived there uh...
[2:17:52.280 --> 2:17:57.080]  the the process worked well for the local people i mean
[2:17:57.080 --> 2:18:01.880]  prior to them coming they just had one more after another that's right all of
[2:18:01.880 --> 2:18:06.840]  africa has ascended into hell the crime rate is up several thousand percent
[2:18:06.840 --> 2:18:10.600]  in south africa but the media won't talk about it
[2:18:10.600 --> 2:18:13.960]  and now we have one of the italian members of parliament
[2:18:13.960 --> 2:18:17.960]  is in trouble the new york times says because he said quote
[2:18:17.960 --> 2:18:22.360]  we've tolerated all this illegal immigration all these years
[2:18:22.360 --> 2:18:25.800]  and that's what's causing this now see the politicians aren't even allowed to
[2:18:25.800 --> 2:18:29.000]  tell the truth because this process of destroying the west
[2:18:29.000 --> 2:18:32.840]  must accelerate just as the empires have destroyed the third world
[2:18:32.840 --> 2:18:36.040]  because that makes them more easy to manage and you use a third world
[2:18:36.040 --> 2:18:39.560]  population to blow out the economy drive down wages
[2:18:39.560 --> 2:18:44.040]  you get them on welfare as a voting block that takes over the country
[2:18:44.040 --> 2:18:49.160]  we get the same thing in the united states with the illegal immigration
[2:18:49.160 --> 2:18:52.680]  they drove down wages there's no question about that
[2:18:52.680 --> 2:18:56.600]  and of course they've used the public facilities and that's cost the people of
[2:18:56.600 --> 2:18:59.960]  the united states quite a bit of money especially in states that
[2:18:59.960 --> 2:19:04.520]  have large amounts of illegal aliens that the bankers love that because we're
[2:19:04.520 --> 2:19:08.360]  even in deeper debt to them that's right
[2:19:08.360 --> 2:19:12.040]  and now they want to bring them into the system so they can charge them so
[2:19:12.040 --> 2:19:15.480]  security and taxation and so on and so forth
[2:19:15.480 --> 2:19:21.000]  i mean in this new bill it talks about the cost of
[2:19:21.000 --> 2:19:25.160]  serving the illegal immigrant community remember they promised to pull that out
[2:19:25.160 --> 2:19:28.680]  but it's in there and just incredible when we come back

[2:25:16.520 --> 2:25:22.280]  mr ocelloven who is a former central intelligence agency

[2:25:38.040 --> 2:25:43.640]  the emails that were discovered uh... between
[2:25:43.640 --> 2:25:49.560]  michael man who is a professor but man admits he wrote it

[2:25:53.320 --> 2:25:58.600]  and if they can get substantiation what will happen is the government
[2:25:58.600 --> 2:26:02.280]  will try to recoup and i think the figure
[2:26:02.280 --> 2:26:07.400]  is twenty three million that they plan they're going after the fraud of these
[2:26:07.400 --> 2:26:13.000]  universities getting massive federal and and grants off of scamming
[2:26:13.000 --> 2:26:16.840]  and they want the money back and they want to get the money back
[2:26:16.840 --> 2:26:21.880]  they share it with the people who said yeah he he did that he said that
[2:26:21.880 --> 2:26:25.800]  and uh... you know he he said the whole thing was a scam
[2:26:25.800 --> 2:26:28.920]  that sort of thing and that's what they're looking for and that's a
[2:26:28.920 --> 2:26:33.080]  tactic taken for openers uh... i don't know about
[2:26:33.080 --> 2:26:36.440]  uh... criminal preceding proceedings but they should be
[2:26:36.440 --> 2:26:40.040]  uh... unfortunately very often there isn't
[2:26:40.040 --> 2:26:43.880]  uh... the government's more interested in retrieving money
[2:26:43.880 --> 2:26:47.480]  than they are putting people away because one is a
[2:26:47.480 --> 2:26:50.840]  one is good because they get their money back
[2:26:50.840 --> 2:26:54.120]  because they made a mistake on the other hand if you put people in jail
[2:26:54.120 --> 2:26:56.840]  cost them forty fifty thousand dollars a year
[2:26:56.840 --> 2:26:59.960]  and so uh... they would really rather get the money
[2:26:59.960 --> 2:27:04.920]  and so that we haven't heard this is the beginning of the beginning of this
[2:27:04.920 --> 2:27:08.280]  thing uh... he sure it's been going on for a couple
[2:27:08.280 --> 2:27:11.000]  of months now but it's starting to gel
[2:27:11.000 --> 2:27:13.960]  it's just like the problems that we're seeing on wall street
[2:27:13.960 --> 2:27:18.840]  with goldman sacks i wrote about what goldman had done
[2:27:18.840 --> 2:27:23.240]  in the collateralized debt obligation you wrote about it two years ago before
[2:27:23.240 --> 2:27:27.080]  the collapse and now it's confirmed mainstream media they engineered it
[2:27:27.080 --> 2:27:29.400]  all that's right
[2:27:29.400 --> 2:27:34.760]  and uh... we bleated and yelled and screamed and says why hasn't anybody
[2:27:34.760 --> 2:27:39.960]  sued now these are the institutions that bought this bogus paper
[2:27:39.960 --> 2:27:43.680]  and then finally was starting to see lawsuits by
[2:27:43.680 --> 2:27:48.080]  uh.. lebu unions funds
[2:27:48.080 --> 2:27:49.640]  states
[2:27:49.640 --> 2:27:53.640]  who have been built police unions
[2:27:53.640 --> 2:27:55.880]  yes and it's going to grow and now
[2:27:55.880 --> 2:27:59.400]  we have on the front front page
[2:27:59.400 --> 2:28:03.800]  iig hair which was a hundred and twelve point four billion
[2:28:03.800 --> 2:28:07.400]  But it was just the holding company for Goldman Sachs JP Morgan Chase, correct?
[2:28:08.440 --> 2:28:12.840]  Uh, I can't say that because I don't know it was divvying up the goodies. Most of the money that
[2:28:12.840 --> 2:28:20.520]  went to them was paid out to those guys. Right. But there was another aspect to it. And that was
[2:28:20.520 --> 2:28:28.120]  the insuring of different risks and AIG ran naked on them. They had no collateral to back up their
[2:28:28.120 --> 2:28:35.560]  bets, so to speak. They were the bookmaker taking the bet. And all of the recipients who were
[2:28:35.560 --> 2:28:42.840]  involved in doing business with AIG because of the bankruptcy, they were left out in the cold,
[2:28:42.840 --> 2:28:48.280]  $112.4 billion. And if they're not paid back, which they haven't been, that'll destroy confidence
[2:28:48.280 --> 2:28:54.680]  in the system. Exactly. So what the Fed did is they created the money out of thin air, ran it
[2:28:54.680 --> 2:28:59.640]  through AIG and they said, look, you guys keep your mouth shut because if you open it will destroy
[2:28:59.640 --> 2:29:04.680]  you. That's what went on. I wasn't there. I don't know that those are the exact words. That's why
[2:29:04.680 --> 2:29:08.840]  the White House ordered order banks to take the money. So they'd be part of the fraud.
[2:29:10.120 --> 2:29:15.560]  Right. And so now you got a whole bunch of people involved. And I think Timothy Geithner's toast
[2:29:16.200 --> 2:29:19.720]  because he was with the New York Fed at the time and he was a guy that said, look,
[2:29:19.720 --> 2:29:24.840]  you got to keep your mouth shut because we can't let the American public know that everybody's
[2:29:24.840 --> 2:29:30.840]  getting paid off and the tax pay is paying for it. Well, that's like when Bank of America said we
[2:29:30.840 --> 2:29:35.960]  were told to shut up and take the money. Geithner tried to deny it. And then Bank of America just
[2:29:35.960 --> 2:29:44.200]  released the audio. Isn't that beautiful? What sweet justice. Well, you got the rats fighting
[2:29:44.200 --> 2:29:49.000]  with each other. We'll be right back with Bob Chapman on the other side to get his economic
[2:29:49.000 --> 2:29:53.080]  view of what's happening in 2010 and beyond. And your phone calls stay with us.
[2:29:55.080 --> 2:30:01.800]  We're on the march. The empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[2:30:05.000 --> 2:30:09.480]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions. If you're going into a battle
[2:30:09.480 --> 2:30:14.680]  and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want? My answer would be all I
[2:30:14.680 --> 2:30:20.360]  can get in the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones. Food is your only ammunition.
[2:30:20.360 --> 2:30:25.640]  How much do you want? When do you want it now or after the battle starts? When will you need it?
[2:30:25.640 --> 2:30:30.280]  Can you buy it without proper identification? Will there be any food? Will it make your children
[2:30:30.280 --> 2:30:34.840]  sick if there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself? Will you go to the gathering center
[2:30:34.840 --> 2:30:40.200]  and be immunized? You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply. Food is your
[2:30:40.200 --> 2:30:45.480]  ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life. How much will you need? We don't know.
[2:30:45.480 --> 2:30:50.520]  How much do you want? All you can get. I'm Alex Jones. I want all of you good guys to live to

[2:32:05.880 --> 2:32:10.920]  should consider buying a solar power generator. Number one, new climate legislation could easily
[2:32:10.920 --> 2:32:16.200]  double or triple your electric bill. Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power
[2:32:16.200 --> 2:32:21.160]  your electric company allows you to have. It's true, total government control of electricity
[2:32:21.160 --> 2:32:26.120]  in the name of smart grid technology is coming. Number three, in some areas of the country,
[2:32:26.120 --> 2:32:31.640]  the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now a new socialist legislation is only compounding
[2:32:31.640 --> 2:32:36.840]  the problem. Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids. Every year thousands
[2:32:36.840 --> 2:32:41.560]  of families lose their power from weather-related onages. Number five, a solar power generator
[2:32:41.560 --> 2:32:46.040]  provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind. Folks, I really believe in the solar power
[2:32:46.040 --> 2:32:50.760]  generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my old sponsors. You can get more information
[2:32:50.760 --> 2:32:57.640]  at www.mysolarbackup.com. That's mysolarbackup.com. Remember, the government doesn't own the sun,
[2:32:57.640 --> 2:33:27.080]  so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365. Okay, by early next week,
[2:33:27.080 --> 2:33:33.640]  I will get the three contest rules written up, our three contests to expose the naked body
[2:33:33.640 --> 2:33:40.120]  scanners. And I did see, after we talked about it, people in England protesting naked, they did it
[2:33:40.120 --> 2:33:45.960]  before we even talked about it or thought of it ourselves separately, of people to protest naked,
[2:33:45.960 --> 2:33:51.240]  to illustrate to the world that you are being recorded naked, you know, something extreme
[2:33:51.240 --> 2:33:56.120]  to get media attention, extreme things happening, take extreme measures, because they're going to
[2:33:56.120 --> 2:34:02.760]  make you be scanned naked and lose your privacy and be humiliated to train you to accept all this
[2:34:02.760 --> 2:34:10.600]  if we don't say no and stand up against this. But I told you two or three days ago when I first
[2:34:10.600 --> 2:34:16.760]  talked about that, that that isn't the official contest. We're just thinking of ideas of things
[2:34:16.760 --> 2:34:23.240]  that would get media attention and point out how horrible this is. The more I think about it, though,
[2:34:23.240 --> 2:34:30.360]  I'm not going to have a contest specifically where we say, you know, whoever has the best
[2:34:30.360 --> 2:34:35.000]  topless protest. Okay, that would certainly be the most devastating thing to the media,
[2:34:35.000 --> 2:34:38.440]  would get the attention and point out you're going to be recorded naked. You understand,
[2:34:38.440 --> 2:34:42.760]  if we don't stop this, the government's going to force you to do it and have mobile vans driving
[2:34:42.760 --> 2:34:48.760]  around doing it and brain scanners and passive body scanners that scan your naked body from a
[2:34:48.760 --> 2:34:54.440]  distance. That's now in the mainstream news today, up on prisonplanet.com and infowars.com.
[2:34:56.760 --> 2:35:01.000]  But if people are already having those protests before we even thought of the idea separately,
[2:35:01.000 --> 2:35:05.240]  people always think of the same, I think like 10 guys invented radio the same month around the
[2:35:05.240 --> 2:35:13.800]  world, not just Marconi of Italy, but it's just the best protest video. You have a protest or
[2:35:13.800 --> 2:35:19.160]  you go to a protest, you edit the best video that has infowars in it. That way we get the
[2:35:19.160 --> 2:35:23.320]  hits and visitors and it goes a little ways towards paying out the $10,000 in prize money.
[2:35:24.200 --> 2:35:28.440]  We'll announce it next week with specific rules, got to follow local laws and all that,
[2:35:28.440 --> 2:35:33.080]  and you will win and people can do whatever they want in the demonstration. In fact, I even said
[2:35:33.080 --> 2:35:36.920]  that day, I don't think you specifically, you know, to be part of the contest. I'm saying people
[2:35:36.920 --> 2:35:42.280]  could go out and be naked and, you know, the best naked or partially naked or maybe in bikinis or
[2:35:42.280 --> 2:35:47.560]  whatever to point out your, you know, to get media attention. It would definitely be a giant
[2:35:47.560 --> 2:35:57.320]  devastating action against them, but I am, I am not going to have the contest specifically
[2:35:57.320 --> 2:36:02.600]  be for that. I think it could be anything you think of, any idea you have. Also the best poster
[2:36:03.480 --> 2:36:09.080]  that you post in legal public places and then videotape. We've had several contests in the
[2:36:09.080 --> 2:36:15.240]  past like the Obama Joker poster situation. So that is all coming up next week. The best stunt
[2:36:15.240 --> 2:36:21.720]  that's legal and lawful $5,000 to expose the body scanners, the best media stunt, the best poster
[2:36:22.360 --> 2:36:26.200]  posted in public and then videotaped. So you'll win for the best video of the stunt,
[2:36:26.200 --> 2:36:33.640]  the best video of the posters, and the best video of the demonstration. Total $20,000 in prizes,
[2:36:33.640 --> 2:36:40.680]  $5,000 for the best poster video, $5,000 for the best stunt video and $10,000 for the best overall
[2:36:40.680 --> 2:36:48.360]  protest. And you can decide yourself what you think is the best thing to do. So that is coming
[2:36:48.360 --> 2:36:52.920]  up with specific rules and details. And I told you with the boycotts, I'm getting your ideas,
[2:36:52.920 --> 2:36:57.880]  your emails, your calls of the best boycott to call for next week. So we're also going through
[2:36:57.880 --> 2:37:02.280]  that process right now. We're percolating, we're putting ideas out there. We're seeing what you
[2:37:02.280 --> 2:37:07.480]  think of them. I would say 90 plus percent of people like the idea of the naked protest,
[2:37:08.040 --> 2:37:13.560]  10% or so don't like it. Regardless, it's about stopping the naked body scanners,
[2:37:13.560 --> 2:37:18.440]  them making you go through it and be recorded. We're going back to Bob Chapman in a moment,
[2:37:18.440 --> 2:37:22.760]  we'll get his take on the body scanners and then get some more economic news and go to your calls.
[2:37:22.760 --> 2:37:26.920]  Before I do that, I want to tell you about a few of the sponsors that have made today's radio show
[2:37:26.920 --> 2:37:33.080]  possible. One of them is a cola blue dot com, the atmospheric water generator. Did you know
[2:37:33.080 --> 2:37:36.600]  you can be drinking fresh, clean water made right out of the area you breathe? Now this isn't
[2:37:36.600 --> 2:37:40.920]  something out of a science fiction book. Our sponsor a cola blue, the color blue 28 and now

[2:38:54.840 --> 2:38:59.240]  Okay, I'm going to try to shut up now for a few minutes and get overall Bob Chapman's view of
[2:38:59.240 --> 2:39:04.040]  the economy in the next year, gold, the dollar and then we're going to go to your calls. But first,
[2:39:04.040 --> 2:39:09.240]  Bob, the naked body scanners. Do you believe as I do this is an outrageous push to make people
[2:39:09.240 --> 2:39:13.960]  capitulate and submit to government because if you'll let them record your naked body,
[2:39:13.960 --> 2:39:17.640]  you'll put up with anything psychological warfare.
[2:39:19.640 --> 2:39:24.200]  You've got it. You got it now. Phil Watson's two articles. They're the first two articles and
[2:39:24.200 --> 2:39:31.320]  tomorrow's the end of the US section on this body scanning. It's dreadful, but it is to
[2:39:31.320 --> 2:39:37.320]  demean people and bringing down to the level that they can be handled like cows or other kinds of
[2:39:37.320 --> 2:39:48.200]  animals. This is what it's all about. Control and this phony baloney African from Nigeria,
[2:39:48.200 --> 2:39:55.160]  supposedly blowing up the plane. Give me a break. You've seen the background on this young man and
[2:39:55.160 --> 2:39:59.640]  his father, haven't you? Oh, the whole thing's completely staged. The sharp dress man leading
[2:39:59.640 --> 2:40:05.320]  him on. The second bomber found the FBI lied. Now they admit it. I mean, as they launch the
[2:40:05.320 --> 2:40:10.680]  body scanners, it happens as they launched the attacks in Yemen. It happens completely staged
[2:40:10.680 --> 2:40:16.040]  right as the cruisers and troops land. The bombing happens. I mean, perfect timing. Same MO.
[2:40:17.560 --> 2:40:23.800]  That's correct. And you know, uh, every time that we, uh, and others put together all this
[2:40:23.800 --> 2:40:29.880]  information and expose it and it gets all over the country and then all over the world, uh,
[2:40:29.880 --> 2:40:36.440]  again, we've got them on the run and I'm telling you, I truly believe this. We're killing them.
[2:40:37.160 --> 2:40:42.280]  They don't know which way to run. Everything they do, uh, just turns into a pile of dung
[2:40:43.000 --> 2:40:49.880]  and, uh, this scanner thing and isn't a chart off on the board of one of these scanner companies.
[2:40:49.880 --> 2:40:54.280]  Yeah. And he consults for the other one. He's making money hand over fist. He recommends
[2:40:54.280 --> 2:41:00.120]  that he orders it before he leaves office. They build them and then he makes money off of it.
[2:41:00.120 --> 2:41:08.680]  Just a criminal enterprise. That's what, uh, Wall Street banking and, uh, and our government
[2:41:08.680 --> 2:41:15.960]  are all about today. It's just right in your face and they just don't care. Now they will care later
[2:41:15.960 --> 2:41:22.680]  when we get all of these people out of Congress who really shouldn't be there, who are on the take
[2:41:22.680 --> 2:41:28.200]  and we can maybe have a decent government and that's up to you listeners. You've got to get
[2:41:28.200 --> 2:41:34.680]  these people out of office as many as possible so we can have a shot at getting our country back.
[2:41:35.400 --> 2:41:41.640]  Now that doesn't work. We get serious problems. Well, they fooled the public into thinking Obama
[2:41:41.640 --> 2:41:47.080]  was going to stop what Bush did. He accelerated it. This trick won't work many times. It is a one
[2:41:47.080 --> 2:41:53.800]  trick pony. People are finally realizing there's a shadow government of private criminal corporations
[2:41:54.360 --> 2:42:00.440]  and as people identify the real enemy, uh, I really do see the momentum completely shifting
[2:42:00.440 --> 2:42:05.720]  in our direction and the globalist, nothing they say is believed anymore, but they just continue
[2:42:05.720 --> 2:42:13.320]  with the fraud and that's going to dig the hole deeper for them legally. Uh, as far as lawsuits
[2:42:13.320 --> 2:42:18.600]  and criminal actions, they will come in time. Of course, unfortunately a lot of them will die
[2:42:18.600 --> 2:42:23.000]  off, but it doesn't mean you can't go after their estates for all the money they've stolen.
[2:42:23.000 --> 2:42:29.800]  I mean, Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup are three blatant examples of real
[2:42:29.800 --> 2:42:35.720]  criminal enterprises. I mean, these people will stop at nothing and I know what they're doing
[2:42:35.720 --> 2:42:41.720]  because I was in that industry for so long. I understand how it works and these things that
[2:42:41.720 --> 2:42:47.400]  they do and you know, the SEC is nothing but an appendage of Wall Street. They don't do anything
[2:42:47.400 --> 2:42:54.360]  to the large firms. They were told of Madoff scam for 10 years over and over and over again
[2:42:54.360 --> 2:43:01.880]  and did nothing in the reason why it was a CIA missile operation. Mr. Madoff, we went to court.
[2:43:01.880 --> 2:43:09.720]  Nobody was allowed in except the attorneys. Uh, there was, uh, there was no, uh, evidence.
[2:43:09.720 --> 2:43:13.560]  There was no other people brought into the picture. I mean, there were hundreds of people
[2:43:13.560 --> 2:43:19.480]  involved in this thing. Hundreds of millions of dollars was stolen. Are you kidding? A hundred
[2:43:19.480 --> 2:43:26.360]  billion. That's right. The first figure I got was 140 billion. They claim it's 80 or 90.
[2:43:26.360 --> 2:43:31.800]  It doesn't make any difference. It's a lot of money and a lot of innocent people get hurt.
[2:43:31.800 --> 2:43:36.040]  And he's one of the founders of the NASDAQ. They're all involved in this stuff.
[2:43:36.040 --> 2:43:43.240]  That's right. Unbelievable. Bob Chapman, real fast, where you got a call. So I want to go
[2:43:43.240 --> 2:43:48.680]  to calls gold, the dollar, uh, all the economic numbers coming in. The media says the, everything's
[2:43:48.680 --> 2:43:54.600]  wonderful, but the real numbers show we're in a depression. That's right. And we started at
[2:43:54.600 --> 2:44:03.800]  last February. So we got a recovery that doesn't exist. Uh, we got the treasury and the Fed in
[2:44:03.800 --> 2:44:08.840]  serious trouble. Uh, we could be rid of the Fed by the end of the year. That could happen.
[2:44:09.800 --> 2:44:15.960]  We're looking at real inflation right now at eight and a quarter percent. It'll be over 14%
[2:44:15.960 --> 2:44:22.520]  by the end of the year, just what's in the pipeline. We're looking at 22.5% real unemployment.
[2:44:22.520 --> 2:44:29.480]  And John Williams' figure is 22.7%. Uh, it'll be 25% by the end of the year, even
[2:44:29.480 --> 2:44:37.000]  with the stimuli that's in the, uh, economy. And I think, uh, the president's going to get
[2:44:37.000 --> 2:44:42.760]  another four or 500 billion, uh, to stimulate the economy, uh, going into the election.
[2:44:43.480 --> 2:44:48.600]  And, uh, and so that's going to create even more inflation. Gold and silver,
[2:44:48.600 --> 2:44:52.360]  they've had the correction. That's normal. And they're going to go higher again.
[2:44:53.000 --> 2:44:55.960]  It's the only safe place to be with your money.
[2:44:55.960 --> 2:45:02.760]  Yeah. Damon Vickers even agreed with that last hour. It seems like anybody with half
[2:45:02.760 --> 2:45:07.160]  a brain knows gold and silver is the place to be because it's not a bubble, because gold hasn't
[2:45:07.160 --> 2:45:14.680]  even gotten to half of its 1980 inflation level. I buy every two or three weeks,
[2:45:17.080 --> 2:45:22.120]  believe me, and you people out there should be doing the same thing. And if you're not,
[2:45:22.120 --> 2:45:30.520]  you just don't get it. And if you can't, please try to get dehydrated and freeze dried foods in
[2:45:30.520 --> 2:45:36.440]  in a water filter and be able to defend your family. And these are very important things
[2:45:36.440 --> 2:45:41.640]  because we don't know where this is all going. I mean, we might get lucky and clear out half of the
[2:45:42.280 --> 2:45:47.960]  crooks in Congress and the next, next election, we may get rid of the Fed. And if we do, we got a
[2:45:47.960 --> 2:45:53.880]  shot shot at getting our country back. If we can identify the real enemy, it isn't Obama. Sure,
[2:45:53.880 --> 2:46:00.040]  we want him out, but it's the people that run him and the Republicans. We've got to get rid of the
[2:46:00.040 --> 2:46:09.000]  bankers that revolving door between Wall Street and Washington. It's got to be shut down. There's
[2:46:09.000 --> 2:46:14.680]  plenty of bright people all over the country who would be happy to be secretary of the treasury
[2:46:14.680 --> 2:46:22.120]  or the assistant, assistant secretary of the treasury, et cetera, et cetera. We don't need
[2:46:22.120 --> 2:46:26.520]  Wall Street running our country. And once you've identified the bankers and how they wreck things
[2:46:26.520 --> 2:46:31.320]  by design, when we kick them out of power and they try to sabotage the economy and we have
[2:46:31.320 --> 2:46:38.600]  evidence, we just send the FBI march into arrest them. Given the frog work, that frog work they
[2:46:38.600 --> 2:46:45.880]  call it. And let's put them away where they belong. I mean, you know, they take kids who got too
[2:46:45.880 --> 2:46:51.160]  much dope that they're selling and give them 10 years. I mean, these guys are stole billions of
[2:46:51.160 --> 2:46:58.120]  dollars, billions. And none of them ever go to jail. We got to change that. We got to put them
[2:46:58.120 --> 2:47:05.320]  in jail. We got to confiscate their ill-begotten gains. And that would be used to get rid of the
[2:47:05.320 --> 2:47:12.520]  deficit. Instead, the bankers are now positioning for excise taxes and sales taxes. And they have
[2:47:12.520 --> 2:47:18.200]  Glenn Beck and all the other Fox people saying the conservative thing is more taxes. Talk about a
[2:47:18.200 --> 2:47:25.720]  bait and switch. Yeah. Well, it's not more taxes. It's less spending. And it's purging the system.
[2:47:25.720 --> 2:47:33.480]  Van Mises, Van Hayek, Rothbard, that's the answer. Classical economics. Let's bite the bullet. Let's
[2:47:33.480 --> 2:47:38.440]  tell the people the truth. Let's tell them what these people have done to us. And let's suffer
[2:47:38.440 --> 2:47:43.000]  for four or five years when we could have only suffered for two. But now we're going to have
[2:47:43.000 --> 2:47:48.680]  to do four or five years. And we got to pick ourselves up as Americans and make our country work
[2:47:48.680 --> 2:47:54.120]  again and get rid of these dreadful people. It's like getting off a booze. If you're drinking a
[2:47:54.120 --> 2:47:58.280]  half gallon of whiskey every day, it's going to hurt when you quit it. But if you don't quit it,
[2:47:58.280 --> 2:48:04.680]  it's going to kill you. Well, at the rate we're going, we're going to see real estate prices
[2:48:04.680 --> 2:48:11.560]  residential down another 10 or 20% this year. You should see what's coming down the line
[2:48:11.560 --> 2:48:18.360]  in these option arms. The amount of money is three or four times what it was in these subprimes.
[2:48:18.360 --> 2:48:24.760]  On top of that, you have all of these homes that are in inventory that the banks won't put on
[2:48:24.760 --> 2:48:30.440]  for sale because there's too many of them out there. And it goes on and on. Commercial real
[2:48:30.440 --> 2:48:36.680]  estate, the banks will not lend to really good, bona fide people who have bought these buildings
[2:48:36.680 --> 2:48:44.280]  because they've been told by the Fed, don't spend any money. Lending was down about 18% last year
[2:48:44.280 --> 2:48:50.280]  by banks, 90% of which went to individuals and businesses, small and medium-sized businesses,
[2:48:50.280 --> 2:48:55.720]  businesses that make up 70 to 90% of all the jobs out there. So you're not going to see
[2:48:55.720 --> 2:49:00.680]  any job recovery because the banks aren't going to lend because they want to stay in business.
[2:49:01.480 --> 2:49:08.840]  And that's the way it's going to be. Absolutely. Let's go to Jason in Colorado.
[2:49:08.840 --> 2:49:12.920]  Jason, thanks for holding. Go ahead. Hey, good afternoon, gentlemen.
[2:49:13.960 --> 2:49:18.520]  Two real quick points. And I'm sorry this has actually came to mind during the Damian Vickers
[2:49:18.520 --> 2:49:23.800]  segment, but the first, I can agree with some of the points Damian brought up. And
[2:49:23.800 --> 2:49:28.120]  certainly we do have problems worldwide. But what needs to be realized is that
[2:49:28.120 --> 2:49:31.640]  they are solved through inspiration of behavior and not controlling behavior.
[2:49:32.200 --> 2:49:39.080]  You do that and that things start to happen. And the second point, I found pretty much a
[2:49:39.080 --> 2:49:45.240]  sick comedy with the fact that the New World Order and folks like them think that the sheeple,
[2:49:45.240 --> 2:49:49.160]  as they like to put it, are pathetic because they have a herd mentality.
[2:49:49.880 --> 2:49:55.320]  Well, I submit to them that they actually have a herd mentality as well in the fact that they
[2:49:56.040 --> 2:50:01.720]  all coalesce around fear, trying to control everybody else, and trying to control the truth.
[2:50:03.880 --> 2:50:07.160]  All right. Let me get a comment on that, Jason, from Bob Chapman. Bob?
[2:50:08.760 --> 2:50:11.880]  Well, they're not controlling the truth. They're creating the truth.
[2:50:11.880 --> 2:50:18.600]  And that's part of this propaganda, information, disinformation, and this whole thing that's
[2:50:18.600 --> 2:50:24.280]  been going on since the 1930s in America. It has in other countries as well. Germany used it during
[2:50:24.280 --> 2:50:32.280]  the war very effectively. And so what has to happen is that we have to take away from them
[2:50:32.280 --> 2:50:40.360]  their ability to do that. You might call it distortion. And that's very, very important.
[2:50:40.360 --> 2:50:44.120]  Because if we don't do that, people will never understand what's going on.
[2:50:44.680 --> 2:50:49.640]  The elites just rationalize all the things they're doing. And then most of the time,
[2:50:49.640 --> 2:50:54.760]  actually work against what they claim their aims are originally. All right. Thank you, Jason.
[2:50:54.760 --> 2:51:00.040]  Maury, Jeff, a few others will cram you in coming up. Then I've got the man from Abel Danger,
[2:51:00.040 --> 2:51:03.560]  Lieutenant Colonel Anthony Schaefer, coming up. You don't want to miss this.

[2:52:06.600 --> 2:52:10.600]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[2:52:10.600 --> 2:52:15.320]  This is our last chance to not relive history. As we're finishing off this agenda,
[2:52:16.120 --> 2:52:21.000]  they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home. I have a tremendous influence
[2:52:21.000 --> 2:52:27.000]  on our president in Congress and they really are calling the shots. I think it's incumbent upon all
[2:52:27.000 --> 2:52:33.000]  of us as American citizens to pay attention. Full of the Republic identifies the enemies of our
[2:52:33.000 --> 2:52:38.840]  nation, the criminal offshore cartel hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes
[2:52:38.840 --> 2:52:43.320]  constructing world government. Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists. They're asking for
[2:52:43.320 --> 2:52:47.960]  more matches and the Congress is saying, who do we make the checkout to? Today seems like nobody
[2:52:47.960 --> 2:52:54.840]  does care and right now in Washington D.C. we have seen a fall of the Republic. Yet you're copy
[2:52:54.840 --> 2:53:01.480]  a fall of the Republic on DVD at infowars.com. We're watching online right now in super high

[2:54:19.080 --> 2:54:24.840]  Lieutenant Colonel Anthony Shaffer coming up in the five after. I'm going to play a clip from
[2:54:24.840 --> 2:54:29.720]  Fable Enemy's Jason Burmes's film that has some clips of him testifying for Congress
[2:54:29.720 --> 2:54:34.440]  in the next segment. Bob Chapman, the international forecaster, is our guest. Don't forget
[2:54:34.440 --> 2:54:39.240]  get a free copy of his newsletter by going to the international forecaster.com and valuable
[2:54:39.240 --> 2:54:46.760]  information. He uses our stuff, we use his stuff. I can call Bob up and ask his view on something
[2:54:46.760 --> 2:54:52.120]  and he'll have pretty close to my educated view on it. A lot of times, I'll add even more. He's an
[2:54:52.120 --> 2:55:00.120]  invaluable source of info. Mori in Arizona, you're on the air with Bob Chapman. Go ahead.
[2:55:00.120 --> 2:55:05.480]  Hey, Mori, you there, buddy? Okay, he's not there. Jeff in Tennessee, you're on the air. Go ahead.
[2:55:06.920 --> 2:55:10.680]  Hey, Alex, can you hear me? Yes, I can. You're on the air with Bob Chapman. Go ahead.
[2:55:10.680 --> 2:55:15.320]  Good. Bob, this is Jeff from Tennessee and Michigan. I've been sending you quite a bit of
[2:55:15.320 --> 2:55:22.440]  email over the years. It's good to speak with you. Thank you. The question that I have, I have a
[2:55:22.440 --> 2:55:27.000]  friend of mine in Michigan that's been wiped out. The same as my family's been wiped out.
[2:55:27.000 --> 2:55:34.440]  That's why we're in Tennessee from Michigan. He has a 401k and he's desperately trying to
[2:55:34.440 --> 2:55:41.480]  figure out where to put this thing. It's 1% interest at the bank and then it's 3% interest
[2:55:41.480 --> 2:55:47.800]  at the insurance company. Do you have any recommendations? Yes, golden silver coins and shares
[2:55:48.520 --> 2:55:54.120]  and depending upon how much money he's got, if there's millions in it, well, then he'd have
[2:55:54.120 --> 2:55:59.640]  to use some other things like sovereign treasuries from Canada or Switzerland.
[2:55:59.640 --> 2:56:10.760]  But it's pretty simple. The email address, b-o-b-a-t-f-o-r-e-c-a-s-t-e-r.com.
[2:56:11.480 --> 2:56:16.680]  You email me and you tell me the problem and I'll get you the answer and all the people to work with.
[2:56:17.480 --> 2:56:21.720]  All right, Jeff, I'm going to jump some more. Get in. Allen in Arizona, you're on the air. Go ahead.
[2:56:21.720 --> 2:56:30.520]  Hey, I'm calling to tell you that they're doing random searches out here, DPS. My buddy said he
[2:56:30.520 --> 2:56:37.160]  just saw five and I'm driving around looking for them. Sir, they're going to have naked body
[2:56:37.160 --> 2:56:42.040]  scanners on the streets of America. It's been announced. I mean, this is everything TSA does
[2:56:42.040 --> 2:56:48.520]  on airports they've said is going nationwide. Totally unconstitutional. Yep, it's happening
[2:56:48.520 --> 2:56:52.600]  right here before our eyes. I just came out but I guess I'm a little late to get pictures.
[2:56:53.160 --> 2:56:58.920]  But their DPS is crawling all over the place and I wanted to bring one other point up. It's very
[2:56:58.920 --> 2:57:04.680]  important. There's a family court judge who's running for a reelection and he's going to run
[2:57:04.680 --> 2:57:12.280]  unopposed. His name is Stephen Jones in Las Vegas and I encourage anybody in Las Vegas to please
[2:57:12.280 --> 2:57:18.280]  find a competent constitutional attorney to run against him. Okay, awesome. I'm going to let you
[2:57:18.280 --> 2:57:23.560]  go. I appreciate your call. Yeah. So much of this is even our great listeners, Bob, who are great
[2:57:23.560 --> 2:57:28.120]  people, they're not running for office. They're not taking action. They're not involved. We need
[2:57:28.120 --> 2:57:33.240]  everybody to take action. You don't have to save the world by yourself. Everybody doing a little
[2:57:33.240 --> 2:57:39.160]  something every day will bring these people down. And you're absolutely right about it.
[2:57:39.160 --> 2:57:45.000]  You're just a little bit here, a little bit there. It's a spree to core. We got to work together.
[2:57:49.640 --> 2:57:54.760]  Well, that's what it takes, Bob, and I agree with you. Time is running out for the new
[2:57:54.760 --> 2:57:59.000]  world order. I mean, they are so arrogant. They are so criminal. They are so out in the open.
[2:57:59.880 --> 2:58:03.080]  They think they're going to get away with it. They're openly announcing world government.
[2:58:03.080 --> 2:58:08.840]  It's going to be rough, rough years ahead. But in the end, we can see a victory.
[2:58:10.200 --> 2:58:14.440]  And it's not far away. In the next three or four years, we'll be able to stop them.
[2:58:15.080 --> 2:58:19.000]  But again, you've got to help us. We can't do it on our own.
[2:58:21.480 --> 2:58:25.560]  And it's just waking up a neighbor, waking up a police officer, going to county commissioners
[2:58:25.560 --> 2:58:29.480]  quarters, city council and speaking, going to your state legislature, shaking hands,
[2:58:29.480 --> 2:58:33.320]  talking to the legislatures, telling them you don't want new world order. You don't want bigger
[2:58:33.320 --> 2:58:39.640]  government suing corrupt politicians, saying no to the banks. Great job, Bob Chapman. We'll see
[2:58:39.640 --> 2:58:43.960]  you again next Friday. Thank you so much. Thank you. And thank everybody for listening.

[2:58:51.880 --> 2:59:00.360]  Hi, folks. This is Alex Jones, and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[2:59:00.360 --> 2:59:05.320]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into
[2:59:05.320 --> 2:59:10.760]  the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs. The respiratory system is the first
[2:59:10.760 --> 2:59:15.960]  line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses. The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the
[2:59:15.960 --> 2:59:21.800]  respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the
[2:59:21.800 --> 2:59:27.640]  silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream. With continued legislation threatening the sale
[2:59:27.640 --> 2:59:33.880]  of nano-silver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs
[2:59:33.880 --> 2:59:39.000]  Generator. Very easy to follow, step-by-step instructions are provided, making production
[2:59:39.000 --> 2:59:46.200]  fast and simple. Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology
[2:59:46.200 --> 3:00:12.200]  of the Silver Lungs Generator. That's www.silverlungs.com. Waging war on corruption. Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[3:00:16.600 --> 3:00:34.440]  Now I guess we can safely say that there were people within the FBI and other agencies,
[3:00:34.440 --> 3:00:39.560]  who actively protected and aided the alleged terrorists. With all the resources available
[3:00:39.560 --> 3:00:43.960]  to US intelligence, you would think that someone within would have detected something.
[3:00:43.960 --> 3:00:50.040]  Well, one did. The Black Operation Program, Abel Danger, identified the hijackers prior to 9-11,
[3:00:50.040 --> 3:00:55.320]  but the FBI wasn't interested. Lieutenant Colonel Anthony Shaffer, an intelligence officer inside
[3:00:55.320 --> 3:01:02.920]  Abel Danger, tried to blow the whistle several times. Was the commission that investigated the
[3:01:02.920 --> 3:01:09.480]  9-11 attacks told that lead hijacker Mohammed Atta had been identified in an al-Qaeda operative
[3:01:09.480 --> 3:01:15.640]  more than a year before terrorists struck? I am told confidently by the person who did move
[3:01:15.640 --> 3:01:21.480]  the material over that the 9-11 commission received two briefcase-size containers of documents.
[3:01:21.480 --> 3:01:27.480]  I can tell you for a fact, that would not be one one-twentieth of the information that Abel
[3:01:27.480 --> 3:01:32.440]  Danger consisted of during the time we spent. Shaffer would also meet with Phillip Zelikow,
[3:01:32.440 --> 3:01:36.680]  the executive director of the 9-11 commission. What did Shaffer tell Zelikow?
[3:01:36.680 --> 3:01:41.960]  I'm quoting how I remember saying it. We found, as part of the data run, we found two of the three
[3:01:41.960 --> 3:01:48.440]  cells which conducted the 9-11 attacks to include Atta. Shaffer says his unit linked Atta to al-Qaeda
[3:01:48.440 --> 3:01:53.720]  leaders, but would not provide any specifics as to what he did with the information he had.
[3:01:53.720 --> 3:01:59.080]  We attempted to, first off, use it operationally. The lawyer said you can't do that. They're
[3:01:59.080 --> 3:02:05.240]  considered US persons. Therefore, at that point in time, we made a determination as a team that
[3:02:05.240 --> 3:02:09.640]  we should move this information to the FBI. But he says beginning in September 2000,
[3:02:09.640 --> 3:02:15.960]  three meetings he set up with the FBI were each canceled by military lawyers. Despite all of this,
[3:02:15.960 --> 3:02:20.360]  the 9-11 commission would deny it any significance and not include it in the report.
[3:02:21.160 --> 3:02:28.840]  Leaving a project targeting al-Qaeda as a global threat a year before we're attacked by al-Qaeda
[3:02:28.840 --> 3:02:33.640]  is equivalent to having an investigation of Pearl Harbor and leaving somehow out the Japanese.
[3:02:33.640 --> 3:02:37.640]  Shaffer and his team tried to stop the hijackers prior to 9-11,
[3:02:37.640 --> 3:02:41.560]  but were blocked. Later, the military would begin a smear campaign against them
[3:02:41.560 --> 3:02:45.720]  in order to discredit their findings. Pennsylvania Congressman says there's
[3:02:45.720 --> 3:02:50.280]  a smear campaign going on inside the Pentagon and he wants the defense chief to get to the
[3:02:50.280 --> 3:02:54.920]  bottom of it. Republican Congressman Kurt Weldon says Pentagon officials are trying to ruin one
[3:02:54.920 --> 3:03:00.360]  of their own who's gone public about a top-secret military intel unit. Lieutenant Colonel Tony
[3:03:00.360 --> 3:03:04.920]  Shaffer, who was the first member of Able Danger to go public, has now been told in writing by
[3:03:04.920 --> 3:03:09.400]  the Defense Intelligence Agency that he can't speak to members of Congress or their staff
[3:03:09.400 --> 3:03:14.200]  without prior approval. And now a security clearance which allowed him to deal with classified
[3:03:14.200 --> 3:03:19.960]  information has been pulled. The Congressman says Shaffer has been gagged, punished for speaking up.
[3:03:21.480 --> 3:03:26.280]  It's obvious to me this is a clear attempt to silence this guy, but now even more than to
[3:03:26.280 --> 3:03:32.440]  silence him to ruin him as a person and a military officer. I've talked to all the Able Danger players
[3:03:32.440 --> 3:03:37.960]  and they all agree this is a witch hunt against Tony, it's wrong, it's un-American, it's unacceptable.
[3:03:38.440 --> 3:03:43.000]  Pentagon reportedly does not want the public to hear next week's Senate testimony
[3:03:43.000 --> 3:03:48.680]  about the former secret intelligence unit known as Able Danger. Two congressional sources have
[3:03:48.680 --> 3:03:54.360]  told Fox News that the military's pressuring senators to move the hearings behind closed doors.
[3:03:54.360 --> 3:03:57.640]  When the Able Danger hearings were held, Shaffer and others were gagged.
[3:03:59.400 --> 3:04:02.680]  Eventually, Shaffer would be able to speak at a whistleblower's hearing.
[3:04:04.920 --> 3:04:08.520]  Many of us take seriously our oath of office's support and defend the Constitution against
[3:04:08.520 --> 3:04:14.120]  all enemies, foreign and domestic. Let me be upfront here. I am no Boy Scout. I was not hired
[3:04:14.120 --> 3:04:19.000]  as an intelligence officer because I hang out at the Christian Science Reading Room. My job is
[3:04:19.000 --> 3:04:23.560]  to get information using tried and true intelligence methodologies. According to my legal counsel,
[3:04:23.560 --> 3:04:29.640]  until I disclosed the Able Danger information, I was a rock star. It was my work as chief of
[3:04:29.640 --> 3:04:37.240]  DIA's Special Mission Task Force back in 1998 that I became involved with Able Danger. My officers
[3:04:37.240 --> 3:04:42.200]  and I were working at the cutting edge of technology and DOD Black operations. Most of all of my
[3:04:42.200 --> 3:04:48.120]  operations and operational records remain classified. With all this evidence, why did the 9-11 Commission
[3:04:48.120 --> 3:04:53.320]  and Pentagon suppress valuable information about the hijackers' activities leading up to the
[3:04:53.320 --> 3:05:10.840]  attacks? Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone. This is our last
[3:05:10.840 --> 3:05:16.600]  chance to not relive history. As we're finishing off this agenda, we're pulling the rug from
[3:05:16.600 --> 3:05:22.760]  underneath the Americans at home. I have tremendous influence on our president in Congress and they
[3:05:22.760 --> 3:05:29.480]  really are calling the shots. I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.

[3:05:35.560 --> 3:05:40.360]  on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government. Tim Geithner,

[3:08:23.400 --> 3:08:30.680]  his new book, The Dark Side of the Force, comes out. Much of what he knows he can't tell us because
[3:08:30.680 --> 3:08:35.080]  of national security, but he's got a little bit of new info he can reveal here today.
[3:08:35.800 --> 3:08:39.640]  We're going to talk about a host of issues, the underwear bomber, the body scanners, the police
[3:08:39.640 --> 3:08:44.360]  state, 9-11, how he was gagged for being able to talk to the public about what he knew, how he
[3:08:44.360 --> 3:08:49.720]  was persecuted. He's Lieutenant Colonel Anthony Schaefer of course of able danger fame. You've
[3:08:49.720 --> 3:08:56.360]  seen him on television many, many times and he is with us again for the next 30 minutes or so.
[3:08:56.920 --> 3:08:59.160]  Colonel Schaefer, it's great to have you here with us.
[3:08:59.160 --> 3:09:02.040]  Well, thanks. Thank you so much for having me on. I really appreciate it.
[3:09:02.760 --> 3:09:07.320]  Well, I'm glad that we got in touch with each other. There's so much going on and I could go
[3:09:07.320 --> 3:09:13.880]  over your bio, but for those that may not know who you are, recap who you are and your experience
[3:09:14.520 --> 3:09:18.200]  with trying to stop 9-11 and then your persecution.
[3:09:18.200 --> 3:09:23.640]  Right. Well, to put it all in kind of a nutshell, I'm a case officer by trade, trained by CI years
[3:09:23.640 --> 3:09:29.800]  ago, a lot of years ago. My primary job with Department of Defense was to conduct human
[3:09:29.800 --> 3:09:36.440]  intelligence operations that which the public commonly knows as espionage. I did that for about
[3:09:36.440 --> 3:09:43.960]  20 years and my specialty was special operations support, direct sports special operations. So
[3:09:43.960 --> 3:09:49.400]  while I wasn't necessarily a green beret, I spent a lot of time with and supporting him and then
[3:09:49.400 --> 3:09:57.240]  doing things in what's known as the black world, the black operations world. And of course,
[3:09:57.880 --> 3:10:04.200]  within the context of that, I did a lot of it both as an Army civilian, as an Air Force civilian,
[3:10:04.200 --> 3:10:09.560]  and also as a Defense Intelligence Agency civilian. All along, I was an Army reservist and a lot of
[3:10:09.560 --> 3:10:18.120]  the stuff I would do and still continue to do is as an Army reservist. And so the primary focus of
[3:10:18.120 --> 3:10:23.480]  all of that work, frankly, was going after hard targets, going after the real challenges of the
[3:10:23.480 --> 3:10:29.240]  country, the North Koreans, the Iranians. I did a lot of work on things like counter drug back
[3:10:29.240 --> 3:10:34.760]  when we were actually focusing on counter drug back in the 90s. And it all kind of culminated
[3:10:34.760 --> 3:10:41.800]  in the late 90s, at least from my perspective, in a project called Able Danger. And An Able Danger
[3:10:41.800 --> 3:10:50.520]  was essentially an entrepreneurial concept that was brought up by General Hugh Shelton,
[3:10:50.520 --> 3:10:55.480]  who was then chairman of the Joint Chiefs who tasked General Schoonmaker, the then commander of
[3:10:55.480 --> 3:11:00.280]  Special Operations Command, to bring together a group to really do out-of-the-box thinking,
[3:11:00.280 --> 3:11:06.760]  to take a clean sheet of paper, if you will, and try to see what would be possible to go after a
[3:11:06.760 --> 3:11:13.240]  transnational, and what we mean by transnational is something that does not sit in one single country,
[3:11:13.240 --> 3:11:18.280]  a transnational threat, which back then was the then-blossoming threat of al-Qaeda.
[3:11:19.080 --> 3:11:25.000]  And it was very innovative. We tried to put together a hybrid team of folks from Defense
[3:11:25.000 --> 3:11:28.840]  Intelligence, which was my element, something called Stratocivy. We were a special mission
[3:11:28.840 --> 3:11:35.400]  task force, along with technology and support of the Army, Army Land Information Warfare Activity,
[3:11:35.400 --> 3:11:40.600]  which was doing some very advanced data mining, which was then being funded by Representative
[3:11:40.600 --> 3:11:44.680]  Kurt Weldon. There was a great interest in, by Congress, try to actually do some things with
[3:11:44.680 --> 3:11:49.880]  new technology. All on behalf of the Special Operations Command, who had the charter, who was
[3:11:49.880 --> 3:11:55.800]  tasked by General Shelton and General Schoonmaker, try to find ways to go after al-Qaeda. And again,
[3:11:55.800 --> 3:12:01.000]  it's notable here, Alex, that this was all pre-911. This was all done 98, 99, 2000.
[3:12:02.200 --> 3:12:07.320]  And it was a very advanced-for-the-time data mining effort. That was the... A lot of people
[3:12:07.320 --> 3:12:13.320]  understand. That was just one part of it. The actual components, the larger moving pieces,
[3:12:13.320 --> 3:12:18.120]  if you will, were never really brought to light during the able danger hearings and
[3:12:18.120 --> 3:12:21.800]  everything else. And I will talk about that a little bit more in the book when the book comes
[3:12:21.800 --> 3:12:26.120]  out. Right now, it's going to be a review, so I'm not sure what's going to make it through
[3:12:26.120 --> 3:12:29.720]  completely, but the idea here... You're having to get, for those that don't know,
[3:12:29.720 --> 3:12:35.000]  National Security View, Overview and Release Authorization from what? The Department of
[3:12:35.000 --> 3:12:41.320]  Defense, CIA? Oh, no, from Army. Since I'm an Army body and I was actually on active duty
[3:12:41.880 --> 3:12:46.760]  with the Army during the time that I was conducting the operations in Afghanistan.
[3:12:46.760 --> 3:12:50.840]  And this book is going to focus primarily on Afghanistan, the Dark Side of the Force.
[3:12:50.840 --> 3:12:57.400]  And it has to do with my work there, working as part of Task Force 180 and Task Force 121.
[3:12:57.400 --> 3:13:03.080]  I was actually attached to 121, which is General Crystal's command in Afghanistan,
[3:13:03.080 --> 3:13:08.920]  back in 03 and 04. And it goes into a fairly good detail about how we were doing things.
[3:13:08.920 --> 3:13:15.400]  And frankly, we're portraying it clearly as the tipping point in Afghanistan. We've been able to...
[3:13:15.400 --> 3:13:19.720]  A lot of the folks I worked with have collaborated. I was assigned to something called the Leadership
[3:13:19.720 --> 3:13:25.880]  Targeting Cell, the LTC. We had good cooperation, excellent cooperation from my colleagues on that.
[3:13:26.680 --> 3:13:32.280]  And so we've been able to kind of go through it in detail. It's kind of an action-adventure,
[3:13:32.280 --> 3:13:36.760]  and I think the readers will like it by the fact I try to tell it from the first person,
[3:13:37.320 --> 3:13:41.160]  much like the Martin Sheen character, the Captain Willard character in Apocalypse Now.
[3:13:41.160 --> 3:13:45.480]  It's almost... And you can probably appreciate this from your perspective, Alex. The insanity
[3:13:45.480 --> 3:13:52.200]  of seeing bureaucracy in action. And a large part of the focus is kind of give people a feel for
[3:13:52.200 --> 3:13:56.920]  what it was like to have to deal with not only the enemies that are shooting at you, but your own
[3:13:56.920 --> 3:14:02.040]  enemies who are behind the wire who just really don't want to do the right thing. And so we try
[3:14:02.040 --> 3:14:06.440]  to portray this fairly, and it'll be focused primarily on my work in Afghanistan.
[3:14:06.440 --> 3:14:10.040]  Well, we're going to talk about that one, and I'm looking really before the full hour interview
[3:14:10.040 --> 3:14:15.400]  with you when the dark side of the Force comes out and find out who the Emperor Palpatine
[3:14:15.400 --> 3:14:23.160]  is in this story. But expanding, you then try to tell the 9-11 Commission and Congress this info,
[3:14:23.160 --> 3:14:26.600]  and then they began to persecute you. Why was that?
[3:14:27.160 --> 3:14:31.320]  Well, it's interesting how it all kind of popped up, and the book will only talk about the initial
[3:14:31.320 --> 3:14:37.720]  disclosure, and it'll end kind of with me being pulled off the front line after my second deployment
[3:14:37.720 --> 3:14:43.400]  to Afghanistan. But my initial disclosure came to directly to Dr. Philip Zalacow, who was the
[3:14:43.400 --> 3:14:49.320]  then chair of the 9-11 Commission. And what I just told you and your audience is what I told him,
[3:14:49.320 --> 3:14:56.200]  but in about an hour's worth of briefing, where I lay out all the bones of the operation. I lay
[3:14:56.200 --> 3:15:01.480]  out everything from who was involved, what was the focus. I talked about some plans and operations
[3:15:01.480 --> 3:15:07.320]  which were related to it, which we were using to support the targeting effort. And of course,
[3:15:07.320 --> 3:15:11.800]  one of the things which drew total silence and shock when I brought it up was the fact that we
[3:15:11.800 --> 3:15:18.280]  discovered three of the 9-11 hijacker cells. We discovered three of the four cells of the 9-11
[3:15:18.280 --> 3:15:23.880]  attacks. And it was total shock and dismay by the people in the room to include Dr. Zalacow.
[3:15:24.680 --> 3:15:28.280]  And then during that initial disclosure, he pulls me aside at the end of that meeting,
[3:15:28.280 --> 3:15:32.520]  and that pogrom has happened in October of 03. And he gives me his card and says,
[3:15:32.520 --> 3:15:36.280]  what you said today, and I'm going to quote as accurately as I remember, and I think this is
[3:15:36.280 --> 3:15:41.000]  directly from my testimony, what you said today is very important. We need to continue this dialogue.
[3:15:41.000 --> 3:15:46.200]  I need you to contact me upon your return to the United States, at which time I explain to him,
[3:15:46.200 --> 3:15:49.240]  well, you know, I'm going to be, I'm actually under cover here, so I'm going to give you,
[3:15:49.240 --> 3:15:53.720]  you know, my real name is something else. I will, you know, contact your staff when I get back.
[3:15:54.360 --> 3:15:59.320]  And it was during that time between October and February and in January, frankly,
[3:15:59.320 --> 3:16:02.840]  something happened. And to me, there's still a mystery of what exactly happened.
[3:16:03.400 --> 3:16:08.600]  But sure enough, I followed up, contacted his staff, and all of a sudden they don't want to talk to
[3:16:08.600 --> 3:16:13.720]  me, even though what I said there, the pogrom, they were very, very shocked, very interested.
[3:16:14.280 --> 3:16:19.320]  And I was told after talking to his staff twice, I'll get our quote as accurate as I remember it,
[3:16:19.960 --> 3:16:25.000]  we don't need you to come in. We have all the information unable danger that we need, unquote.
[3:16:25.640 --> 3:16:29.720]  And that's kind of when things started going wrong. And I really didn't know why. Next thing
[3:16:29.720 --> 3:16:34.840]  I know, my clearance is suspended, and I'm pulled off the front line despite the fact I've received
[3:16:34.840 --> 3:16:40.840]  the Bob Star, was sent back a second time to plan a surge operation for another surge to go after
[3:16:40.840 --> 3:16:48.360]  bin Laden. And it was, I was pulled off over what can only be constituted with what's going to be
[3:16:48.360 --> 3:16:55.800]  described as petty issues. And I'll go through them briefly. Well, I mean, hold on before you do
[3:16:55.800 --> 3:17:01.640]  that, Colonel Shaffer. We also have a farmer, one of the head lawyers for the commission, saying
[3:17:01.640 --> 3:17:08.040]  there was a cover up going on within the commission. We see them persecuting you. We see them, I mean,
[3:17:08.040 --> 3:17:12.600]  tell us what happened to you and the persecution. But then what do you think about Sybil Edmond's
[3:17:12.600 --> 3:17:18.600]  testimony that she was listening to communicates were elements of the CIA were communicating with
[3:17:18.600 --> 3:17:24.040]  Al Qaeda and the Taliban and knew about their movements, thanks to the intel you and others
[3:17:24.040 --> 3:17:30.840]  were gathering right up until the moment of 9 11. Well, I tend to believe that there's a regular
[3:17:30.840 --> 3:17:34.680]  truth to that. And then there's there's a couple things I want to add to that to back up your
[3:17:34.680 --> 3:17:40.360]  point. First, when I was in closed hearings, when I was going to close hearings and held back in
[3:17:40.360 --> 3:17:44.360]  2000, I'm going fast forward here a little bit, but 2006 when I was in closed hearings,
[3:17:45.240 --> 3:17:50.280]  representative Sylvester Reyes himself comes up to me. And as you know, Sylvester Reyes is now,
[3:17:50.280 --> 3:17:54.120]  I believe the chair of the House of Representatives Committee on Intelligence and Representative
[3:17:54.120 --> 3:17:59.160]  Reyes comes up and says, Colonel, Colonel Schaefer, I know there's something to what you're saying
[3:17:59.160 --> 3:18:06.200]  because Dr. Zellicow came and approached me in January of 2006 and told and told, I'm sorry 2004
[3:18:06.200 --> 3:18:11.880]  and said, there's something called able danger. We think it's promising. We'll get back to you
[3:18:11.880 --> 3:18:16.440]  on that. And frankly, they never got back to him. So this is one of the senior Democrats coming to
[3:18:16.440 --> 3:18:21.640]  me saying they told us about it, but then they never followed up. And so I do believe something
[3:18:21.640 --> 3:18:27.880]  happened internally. And I've talked to a couple of the 9-11 commission folks. I can't go on a lot
[3:18:27.880 --> 3:18:32.280]  of detail. They've asked me not to give out their names, but frankly, one of the 9-11 commissioners
[3:18:32.280 --> 3:18:37.320]  told me personally, everybody was covering for someone within that commission. I didn't say
[3:18:37.320 --> 3:18:42.680]  that everybody who was a commissioner had an agenda. And what about civil admins saying she
[3:18:42.680 --> 3:18:51.080]  was decoding the FBI slash NSA recordings out of, you know, the foreign language out of Arabic,
[3:18:51.080 --> 3:18:57.800]  and she's sitting there listening to it. And it is elements of Western Intelligence interfacing.
[3:18:57.800 --> 3:19:04.040]  And we know that Dr. Zbigniew Brzezinski brags in two books he wrote that they got the Arab
[3:19:04.040 --> 3:19:09.080]  Legion together out of other Muslim extremist groups and that they were interfacing with it
[3:19:09.080 --> 3:19:15.640]  right up until the attacks. That makes perfect sense for you, a separate division going after them.
[3:19:15.640 --> 3:19:19.400]  Once you expose that you guys could have gone after them, but many others have said they were
[3:19:19.400 --> 3:19:24.200]  kept from going after them, then that shows clearly that they wanted the attacks to happen
[3:19:24.200 --> 3:19:30.440]  to set up a police state in America. Well, I can't go that far, Alex. I mean, you have an overview
[3:19:30.440 --> 3:19:34.040]  different than mine. What I can say in the facts, and this is one of the things that I try to be
[3:19:34.040 --> 3:19:40.280]  very clear on over the past six years is that there's still a great deal of mystery as to why
[3:19:40.280 --> 3:19:45.080]  able danger stopped. And I can state that clearly because this was in my testimony and it's one
[3:19:45.080 --> 3:19:51.000]  of those mysteries, which I let me just say this then, we saw special forces, colonels and others,
[3:19:51.000 --> 3:19:56.920]  your contemporaries, your peers in the news in 2002 complaining. And I had the author, a job
[3:19:56.920 --> 3:20:02.680]  breaker on two with a CIA saying we weren't allowed to go after anybody real. And every time we caught
[3:20:02.680 --> 3:20:07.800]  somebody real, we were told, let him go. Well, I understand what you're saying about the job
[3:20:07.800 --> 3:20:13.480]  breaker and I've read the book. And that's what I'm going to tell you here. Regarding able danger,
[3:20:13.480 --> 3:20:20.520]  there's still a mystery as to why it stopped. The operation planning occurred during the 99-2000
[3:20:20.520 --> 3:20:28.680]  timeframe. And as far as we all know as part of the team, the last tangible real element of able
[3:20:28.680 --> 3:20:35.240]  danger occurred in January, February 2001, in which the able danger core team briefed General
[3:20:35.240 --> 3:20:40.280]  Shelton at the Pentagon about the options. And this is the thing I wanted to emphasize about
[3:20:40.280 --> 3:20:47.320]  able danger, Alex. It was not about data mining. It was about options to take action against al-Qaeda.
[3:20:47.320 --> 3:20:50.520]  And again, that's what we're going to talk about. You were targeting, you were tracking,
[3:20:50.520 --> 3:20:56.360]  you were identifying, and so you had them targeted and identified and you weren't green-lighted.
[3:20:56.360 --> 3:21:04.440]  That's correct. That is an accurate statement. Because as a matter of fact, up till June of 2001,
[3:21:04.440 --> 3:21:10.680]  I was getting calls from my colleague, Commander now Captain Scott Philpott, asking me to reactivate
[3:21:10.680 --> 3:21:16.600]  my component, my stratus ivy element, to help them continue the targeting process. And frankly,
[3:21:16.600 --> 3:21:21.240]  he was getting a great deal of static. I was pulled off. As a matter of fact, I was pretty much
[3:21:21.240 --> 3:21:26.280]  fired because I wouldn't back down on the issue. I actually had a confrontation which you can
[3:21:26.280 --> 3:21:32.040]  find on the internet, where I talked to the government's duty news, where I was interviewed
[3:21:32.040 --> 3:21:37.320]  and I talked about the fact that my boss, Major General Rod Isler, and I had a shouting contest
[3:21:37.320 --> 3:21:42.280]  where I basically said, look, we've got to do this because this is a clear target. And I was told,
[3:21:42.280 --> 3:21:48.040]  it's not your job. I'm the general, you're not, and I'm telling you to stop. So essentially,
[3:21:48.040 --> 3:21:55.160]  during that timeframe from February of 2001 until the attacks, those of us who were trying to
[3:21:55.160 --> 3:21:59.320]  actively work this, who, you know, because of our analysis, you understand this. I mean, I didn't
[3:21:59.320 --> 3:22:03.320]  just come off the street and pick up being an intelligence officer overnight. I had quite a
[3:22:03.320 --> 3:22:07.240]  bit of experience at the time. And so did the entire team. And we were all saying there's
[3:22:07.240 --> 3:22:11.080]  something wrong here. We got to do something because there's indications that these people
[3:22:11.080 --> 3:22:16.760]  are not only going to do something, we have cells of al-Qaeda within the United States.
[3:22:16.760 --> 3:22:21.080]  Well, let me stop you then before we get into that, Colonel Shaffer. We really appreciate
[3:22:21.080 --> 3:22:27.160]  your time here today. Separate investigations on separate operations similar to yours.
[3:22:27.160 --> 3:22:33.720]  They have spoken out and said the State Department and higher level CIA killed our operations to
[3:22:33.720 --> 3:22:41.960]  decapitate al-Qaeda. So your take on that. Well, again, I can only go back to my direct experience.
[3:22:41.960 --> 3:22:50.280]  There was an asset who had fabulous access to al-Qaeda who was, I can't go in a lot of detail,
[3:22:50.280 --> 3:22:53.000]  I have to be very careful about this because I talked about this in closed hearings.
[3:22:53.560 --> 3:22:59.560]  There was an operative, someone we had recruited that we had every indication was loyal to us
[3:22:59.560 --> 3:23:06.120]  who had fabulous access to the al-Qaeda planning elements within Kabul. And frankly,
[3:23:06.920 --> 3:23:11.880]  this gets closer to the point of what Abel Danger, my part of Abel Danger was all about.
[3:23:12.680 --> 3:23:19.480]  That was really the focus for me was Kabul and what this individual had access to. And one of
[3:23:19.480 --> 3:23:25.480]  the things I told the 9-11 Commission was, we don't know why we were told to terminate our access
[3:23:25.480 --> 3:23:32.920]  to this individual. This became a huge battle because my then-boss, who made you know Bob Harding,
[3:23:32.920 --> 3:23:37.720]  actually went to the Hill to plead for our ability to continue running that asset
[3:23:37.720 --> 3:23:41.080]  because he had fabulous access and for some reason it was terminated.
[3:23:41.080 --> 3:23:43.080]  Well, sir, why is it the same story?
[3:23:43.080 --> 3:23:47.320]  It's the 9-11 Commission. And as far as I can tell, this was never followed up in any great detail
[3:23:47.320 --> 3:23:53.400]  either. Why is it the same story with Hassan a couple months ago at Fort Hood? For two years,
[3:23:53.400 --> 3:23:58.520]  he's sending emails. The CIA is capturing it all. Now Congress wants to see that.
[3:23:58.520 --> 3:24:03.880]  They've declared national security. We have the underwear bomber two weeks ago.
[3:24:03.880 --> 3:24:09.000]  He specifically, they want to put him on the watch list. His dad warns he gets through.
[3:24:09.000 --> 3:24:12.440]  I mean, this is not just government incompetence. These guys always get through.
[3:24:12.440 --> 3:24:17.720]  Now, and that's a funny thing here, Alex. You've got to look at this because, again, we had testimony.
[3:24:17.720 --> 3:24:24.040]  We had hearings on this in 2002, 2003. Again, when I testified in 2006 about the same core issues,
[3:24:24.040 --> 3:24:29.640]  and here we are in 2009, and I find it, and I'll be totally blunt here, I find it insulting
[3:24:30.200 --> 3:24:33.640]  that you have the special advisor of the president, Mr.
[3:24:33.640 --> 3:24:39.800]  Dunn, saying, you know, well, you know, we just didn't get our act together.
[3:24:39.800 --> 3:24:46.120]  As an American taxpayer, I'm aghast at the money they have spent over the past six years trying
[3:24:46.120 --> 3:24:51.400]  to fix this after, you know, I pushed it, put my career in line to go testify about it, and yet
[3:24:51.400 --> 3:24:57.640]  no one seems to take seriously the need to fix the system. And Alex, it's not about more. It's
[3:24:57.640 --> 3:25:03.480]  not at all about more. As a matter of fact, we're going the wrong way. The more bureaucracy you create,
[3:25:03.480 --> 3:25:10.760]  the better the chances are you will have an Hassan or an underwear bomber get to security because
[3:25:10.760 --> 3:25:16.200]  you are not layering security. You are bloating security. And this is where, you know, and I know
[3:25:16.200 --> 3:25:19.800]  that one of the reasons we're talking is because Mr. Carpley was saying, you know, I've been out
[3:25:19.800 --> 3:25:24.280]  talking about this a little bit, and I think he agrees with me on this point. I'd like to believe
[3:25:24.280 --> 3:25:31.160]  so. I am not for more bureaucracy. As a matter of fact, the actual elegance of able danger was,
[3:25:31.160 --> 3:25:35.640]  we do, we avoided the bureaucracy. And that was one of the downfalls of the project,
[3:25:35.640 --> 3:25:42.280]  I believe, is because we avoided the powers that be relating to who the pros consider themselves
[3:25:42.280 --> 3:25:46.280]  to be regarding al-Qaeda and all that. And they didn't want you to upstage them.
[3:25:46.280 --> 3:25:50.520]  No, absolutely. And that was a huge issue. I actually had a confrontation with one of the
[3:25:50.520 --> 3:25:56.360]  CIA officers at Socom. He was a friend of mine. I had to go in and break him on able danger.
[3:25:56.360 --> 3:26:01.560]  And he was, he was being as friendly as he could be when he told me,
[3:26:02.120 --> 3:26:06.760]  Tony, I understand what, what, what able danger is about. I know it's not competing with this,
[3:26:06.760 --> 3:26:11.800]  but I can tell you right now, we, we see, I will never share our best information with you,
[3:26:11.800 --> 3:26:16.120]  because if you're successful and we're not, you will upstage us. Therefore, we will not
[3:26:16.120 --> 3:26:22.280]  participate. So again, we recognize- Is that why the CIA has been using Blackwater instead of the
[3:26:22.280 --> 3:26:27.720]  army? Well, you know, I, I, I actually was on ABC News on, on Brian Ross's, with Brian Ross's
[3:26:27.720 --> 3:26:32.280]  unit on this just recently, where I talked about the fact that this is one of the strange ironies.
[3:26:32.280 --> 3:26:36.680]  I was the guy who had to handle the first two Blackwater operatives who were killed in action
[3:26:36.680 --> 3:26:41.400]  back in October of 03. So not only do I have direct knowledge of it, you know, I was the guy
[3:26:41.400 --> 3:26:44.360]  that, you know, when they got killed, I had to do the Gray's registration stuff. That's the
[3:26:44.360 --> 3:26:49.320]  military term for basically coordinating the removal of the bodies from country to leave.
[3:26:49.320 --> 3:26:54.360]  So, and my judgment, absolutely. One of the things we recognized early on during the war is
[3:26:54.360 --> 3:26:57.720]  the CIA really wanted to run its own game. And again, this is going to be something we talk
[3:26:57.720 --> 3:27:02.120]  about in the book to a great extent. So they're setting up their own private army instead of
[3:27:02.120 --> 3:27:06.840]  using the army? That's correct. That is absolutely correct. And what they were doing is, and this
[3:27:06.840 --> 3:27:12.040]  is, this is not new, this is in the public domain, they have their, their, their, their, their ground
[3:27:12.040 --> 3:27:16.440]  operations branch, which actually does their paramilitary operations. And one of the problems
[3:27:16.440 --> 3:27:20.280]  after 9-11 is they had a hard time building enough quickly, quickly, quickly with, with
[3:27:20.280 --> 3:27:24.840]  qualified and cleared officers. So one of the things they did, they took a shortcut and started
[3:27:24.840 --> 3:27:29.480]  hiring Blackwater individuals who were, you know, essentially coming out of, out of army
[3:27:29.480 --> 3:27:34.680]  special operations, out of Navy special operations and putting them out in the field of CIA operatives.
[3:27:34.680 --> 3:27:37.720]  And again, this has been on Brian Ross, you could go to the internet, you can pull up the
[3:27:37.720 --> 3:27:42.920]  story where I talk about this on air. And, and yeah, the fact is this, they were taking these
[3:27:42.920 --> 3:27:47.880]  contractors and using them essentially, and I'll be blunt, mercenaries, they were using them in,
[3:27:47.880 --> 3:27:53.160]  in, in a role, not as security guards, but as, as guys outside the water trying to train
[3:27:53.880 --> 3:27:59.720]  Afghan and Pakistani individuals to be essentially their, their operatives on the ground to do
[3:27:59.720 --> 3:28:05.000]  special operations. And they've got them in Pakistan right now. Yes. So, so exact. So that's
[3:28:05.000 --> 3:28:09.720]  what we're faced with right now. And frankly, one of the things I said with Brian Ross, and I'll
[3:28:09.720 --> 3:28:14.760]  say it again here, is that I think they did a great deal of this to avoid oversight. Because I
[3:28:14.760 --> 3:28:19.160]  think, and I've heard this from other folks on the Hill, the staffers, that there's a lot more
[3:28:19.160 --> 3:28:22.840]  that's supposed to come out on this, because frankly, it appears now, and I think that's one
[3:28:22.840 --> 3:28:27.240]  of the reasons that Mr. Panetta, the DCI, actually went over and reported this to Congress, because
[3:28:27.240 --> 3:28:33.240]  I think when he discovered the fact that Blackwater was being used in operational, not roles, not as
[3:28:33.240 --> 3:28:37.000]  just guards, I think that's one of the reasons he made the disclosure to Congress immediately,
[3:28:37.000 --> 3:28:43.800]  because that is not within, as I understand, the CIA's purview to use Blackwater as, as operatives
[3:28:43.800 --> 3:28:47.880]  instead of guards. And yeah, that, that is clearly something that they used, because they didn't
[3:28:47.880 --> 3:28:53.960]  want to use army guys, regular uniform folks. And as you know, we, we who are in uniform still have
[3:28:53.960 --> 3:28:59.320]  to follow a lot of rules, but there's a lot of laws, a lot of rules and, and, and, but regardless
[3:28:59.320 --> 3:29:05.080]  of those laws and rules, you could have decapitated the Al-Qaeda leadership months before 9 11,
[3:29:05.080 --> 3:29:08.440]  and it didn't happen. And when you expose that, they tried to persecute you.
[3:29:08.440 --> 3:29:14.360]  That, that is, that is my, my belief based on all the evidence and other folks who have
[3:29:14.360 --> 3:29:19.240]  similar evidence and frankly insiders who have confirmed it to me, but will not come forward
[3:29:19.240 --> 3:29:23.160]  because they don't want to give up their career. They understand that they say anything, they'll
[3:29:23.160 --> 3:29:28.200]  be, they'll be gone after as well. This is amazing. We've got a final segment with you,
[3:29:28.200 --> 3:29:33.240]  and I want to shift gears into some other areas of 9 11 and what's currently happening with the
[3:29:33.240 --> 3:29:37.640]  body scanners. Get your take on that. And certainly we look forward to having you back up in the near
[3:29:38.440 --> 3:29:44.520]  future. A Colonel Anthony Schaefer from able danger is our guest. An amazing interview,
[3:29:44.520 --> 3:29:48.680]  ladies and gentlemen. Obviously we've got more time to talk here than on most TV shows,
[3:29:48.680 --> 3:29:58.360]  and this is very revealing. Stay with us. We're on the march. The empire's on the run.
[3:29:58.360 --> 3:30:07.080]  Alex Jones and the GCN radio network. Hello, this is Alex Jones with some
[3:30:07.080 --> 3:30:11.880]  important questions. If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm,
[3:30:11.880 --> 3:30:17.240]  how much ammunition do you want? My answer would be all I can get in the battle for freedom and
[3:30:17.240 --> 3:30:22.360]  the lives of your loved ones. Food is your only ammunition. How much do you want? When do you
[3:30:22.360 --> 3:30:27.320]  want it now or after the battle starts? When will you need it? Can you buy it without proper
[3:30:27.320 --> 3:30:32.200]  identification? Will there be any food? Will it make your children sick if there's a quarantine
[3:30:32.200 --> 3:30:37.080]  and you can't feed yourself? Will you go to the gathering center and be immunized? You wipe out
[3:30:37.080 --> 3:30:42.760]  all these problems if you have a good food supply. Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom
[3:30:42.760 --> 3:30:47.800]  and your life. How much will you need? We don't know. How much do you want? All you can get.
[3:30:47.800 --> 3:30:56.200]  I'm Alex Jones. I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day. Call 1-800-409-5633

[3:31:06.520 --> 3:31:10.520]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[3:31:10.520 --> 3:31:15.240]  This is our last chance to not relive history. As we're finishing off this agenda,
[3:31:16.040 --> 3:31:20.920]  we're pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home. I have tremendous influence
[3:31:20.920 --> 3:31:26.680]  on our president and Congress, and they really are calling the shots. I think it's incumbent upon
[3:31:26.680 --> 3:31:32.760]  all of us as American citizens to pay attention. Full of the Republic identifies the enemies of
[3:31:32.760 --> 3:31:38.760]  our nation. The criminal offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes
[3:31:38.760 --> 3:31:43.240]  constructing world government. Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists. They're asking for
[3:31:43.240 --> 3:31:47.880]  more matches and the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to? Today seems like nobody
[3:31:47.880 --> 3:31:54.760]  does care. And right now in Washington DC, we have seen a fall of the Republic. Get your copy
[3:31:54.760 --> 3:32:01.400]  of Full of the Republic on DVD at infowars.com. We're watching online right now in super high

[3:33:13.880 --> 3:33:19.320]  fabled enemies, details what really happened on 9-11 from all the evidence. My film terror storm
[3:33:19.320 --> 3:33:24.360]  also goes over it. At the bare minimum, governments let this happen so they can take your rights,
[3:33:24.360 --> 3:33:29.240]  your freedom. Take the MYAC report we leaked that the military and police gave us. Take the Homeland
[3:33:29.240 --> 3:33:34.600]  Security report where it's really all set up for conservatives, libertarians, Bob Barr, Ron Paul,
[3:33:35.400 --> 3:33:41.160]  get us out of the UN stickers or demonized. What do you think of hearing that in the news that
[3:33:41.160 --> 3:33:46.680]  most of Homeland Security and domestic operations now is focused on conservatives?
[3:33:47.720 --> 3:33:52.120]  I mean, the public's told this is all for al-Qaeda and then the whole thing set up for the American
[3:33:52.120 --> 3:33:57.400]  people, Colonel Schaefer. Well, I gotta tell you, I believe most of the measures which have been
[3:33:57.400 --> 3:34:02.120]  put in place to include the cost of the body scanner, a lot of those stuff. And frankly,
[3:34:02.120 --> 3:34:06.120]  and we talk a bit about the break about the scanner supports. I gotta tell you, most of
[3:34:06.120 --> 3:34:09.400]  the stuff is proven if you look at the scientific evidence to not really be all that effective,
[3:34:09.400 --> 3:34:15.320]  but we spend tons of money, I actually attended a hearing a while back, on the backscatter devices
[3:34:15.320 --> 3:34:20.440]  that they put in the ports. And the fact that they had to report that the Department of Homeland
[3:34:20.440 --> 3:34:25.240]  Security had to report, they're not really working. And there is something called ASP.
[3:34:25.240 --> 3:34:30.280]  And of course, their answer was, of course, we need more money. Now, if you give us another,
[3:34:30.280 --> 3:34:35.400]  you know, $100 million, well, the manufacturer thinks we'll still fix it. And that's part of
[3:34:35.400 --> 3:34:40.840]  the problem. I think almost the government becomes a taxi, if you will, for corporate America,
[3:34:40.840 --> 3:34:45.080]  because a lot of these companies have huge amounts of resources invested. Raytheon,
[3:34:45.080 --> 3:34:47.880]  Boeing, some of the other big companies, I don't want to, I'm not trying to single them out,
[3:34:47.880 --> 3:34:53.880]  but I'm just saying that a lot of companies do benefit very much by investing in these technologies
[3:34:53.880 --> 3:34:59.960]  and my problem with the process, obviously, is someone who, you know, I'm a think tank guy,
[3:35:00.520 --> 3:35:07.720]  is that they don't really work. And my belief is good money after bad is a key indicator of
[3:35:07.720 --> 3:35:12.360]  a lack of accountability. You've got to be honest, you've got to stand up at some point and say,
[3:35:12.360 --> 3:35:16.520]  it ain't working, we've wasted all this money, you've got to stop, we've got to take a different
[3:35:16.520 --> 3:35:21.800]  course. And this is where we have problems all throughout the system, lack of accountability.
[3:35:21.800 --> 3:35:27.880]  And again, and this is indicative of the fact that we almost had a Northwest Airlines are
[3:35:27.880 --> 3:35:29.960]  brought down by the fact there's no accountability.
[3:35:29.960 --> 3:35:33.800]  Colonel, I don't mean to interrupt you, but we've only got six minutes left with you.
[3:35:33.800 --> 3:35:37.800]  You've agreed to come back on in the near future. And we want to give out any websites,
[3:35:37.800 --> 3:35:42.280]  any other information you want to give here at the end. But let me go back to 9-11 briefly.
[3:35:43.560 --> 3:35:48.760]  Here's CBS News, hijackers live with FBI informant, just going to throw that out.
[3:35:48.760 --> 3:35:53.640]  And they were ordered to stand down, not just you. This is Newsweek, exclusive,
[3:35:53.640 --> 3:35:57.080]  the informant who live with the hijackers. Here's another one, Newsweek,
[3:35:57.080 --> 3:36:02.440]  alleged hijackers may have trained at U.S. bases. Then we get in the Associated Press,
[3:36:03.480 --> 3:36:07.240]  the Colonel, head of the Monterey Defense Language School, saying, look,
[3:36:07.240 --> 3:36:12.440]  some of these guys were at our base. We have Springman, the head of the U.S. Embassy section
[3:36:12.440 --> 3:36:17.400]  in Saudi Arabia being ordered to let them in, even though they were on watch list.
[3:36:17.400 --> 3:36:22.040]  And he was told later, oh, that was part of secret training. They were our operatives.
[3:36:22.040 --> 3:36:28.040]  So we have all of that. You add all of this together. What can you tell us about talking
[3:36:28.040 --> 3:36:33.960]  to other colleagues about hijackers being allowed in and out of the country, being protected,
[3:36:33.960 --> 3:36:39.320]  not acting in a very Muslim extremist fashion with all the whores and drugs and topless bars,
[3:36:39.320 --> 3:36:43.720]  the FBI living with them, Israeli intelligence following them around. What was really going
[3:36:43.720 --> 3:36:50.600]  on here in the U.S.? Well, I gotta be careful to limit myself to my direct knowledge and I'll
[3:36:50.600 --> 3:36:54.200]  add to the pieces that I have. I'll be happy to add the pieces. I don't want to comment on other
[3:36:54.200 --> 3:37:00.040]  people's information. I can tell you this for a fact, Alex, is the fact that during the data
[3:37:00.040 --> 3:37:08.120]  mining phase of able danger, al-Qaeda cells were discovered. And the fact that they were discovered
[3:37:08.120 --> 3:37:15.640]  was haunting. A lot of folks were shocked that the information that we had uncovered as a team
[3:37:16.440 --> 3:37:20.920]  indicated that they were active cells. This is not like just, you know, people who are sleepers.
[3:37:20.920 --> 3:37:26.200]  These are active cells doing things. And the appearance was that they were active.
[3:37:26.200 --> 3:37:29.480]  They weren't sleepers. They were active. They were preparing for something.
[3:37:30.280 --> 3:37:37.560]  Exactly. So that information was passed forward. And there's good evidence now from a friend of
[3:37:37.560 --> 3:37:43.080]  mine who did some research that the information that we came up with was reported to President
[3:37:43.080 --> 3:37:47.960]  Clinton in the Millennium Bomber Report. One of the things that was disclosed that Sandy Boerger
[3:37:47.960 --> 3:37:53.480]  was after was copies of the Millennium Bombing Report. And within that report, that was, you
[3:37:53.480 --> 3:37:58.840]  know, well prior to 9-11, was within that report, and this is reported in John Ashcroft's book.
[3:37:58.840 --> 3:38:02.280]  I don't remember the name of the book off the top of my head, but John Ashcroft actually admits
[3:38:02.280 --> 3:38:09.240]  that there was information in the Millennium Bombing Report relating to al-Qaeda cells,
[3:38:09.240 --> 3:38:15.400]  active cells being found in the United States. So, you know, we believe, based on the evidence we
[3:38:15.400 --> 3:38:22.520]  have, that was our gig. That was able danger. And obviously at that level, you don't call things
[3:38:22.520 --> 3:38:27.400]  by its operational name, but we believe that that information regarding what was in the Millennium
[3:38:27.400 --> 3:38:32.920]  Report that went from Ashcroft to President Clinton was the able danger information.
[3:38:32.920 --> 3:38:37.240]  And it was so damning that Boerger broke national security laws. He could have gone to
[3:38:37.240 --> 3:38:42.120]  prison for life to stick it in his underwear and socks to get it out of there.
[3:38:42.120 --> 3:38:47.320]  That's correct. Yes. So, that is right. And my judgment telling by the fact that, yeah, we did
[3:38:47.320 --> 3:38:52.920]  discover these guys. It was hugely bad for a lot of folks. And one of the controversial points
[3:38:52.920 --> 3:38:57.320]  I've been told about lately, and this is I think new for everybody, one of the things that my
[3:38:57.320 --> 3:39:02.440]  colleagues have told me is like, yeah, the moment that happened, you know, there was
[3:39:02.440 --> 3:39:06.920]  consideration of allowing Special Operations Command to go do some stuff, you know, in the
[3:39:06.920 --> 3:39:10.520]  United States. And that was hugely controversial. And I think that's one of the things they don't
[3:39:10.520 --> 3:39:14.760]  want to have talked about is the fact that, you know, some people, to include myself, thought
[3:39:14.760 --> 3:39:19.480]  that, you know, look, if these guys are operating here, we can do something sooner than later.
[3:39:19.480 --> 3:39:24.200]  And if we're in the best position to do something, let us do it. And that was hugely unpopular for
[3:39:24.200 --> 3:39:28.760]  any number of reasons. Possecoma taught us and all those other restrictions, which I understand
[3:39:28.760 --> 3:39:34.200]  what exists. I support them. But clearly, you know, we had discovered that there were active
[3:39:34.200 --> 3:39:38.520]  cells within the United States. And just so everybody understands, this is not new. Eric
[3:39:38.520 --> 3:39:42.840]  Kleismith, who was the actual analyst who discovered this stuff, testified in front of Senator
[3:39:42.840 --> 3:39:48.920]  Allinspector on this point in August of 2005, I believe. Well, you've told us some new things
[3:39:48.920 --> 3:39:52.520]  and you're getting hopefully security clearance for your book coming out in the early summer,
[3:39:52.520 --> 3:39:57.800]  perhaps even late spring. But but in the last minute we've got, what can you give us foreshadowing
[3:39:57.800 --> 3:40:03.480]  on that is new that's coming out? Well, I think, you know, I mean, just speaking in the general
[3:40:03.480 --> 3:40:08.760]  situation right now, you've got the problem with people like Brennan, who have been part of the
[3:40:08.760 --> 3:40:13.000]  bureaucracy for the entire time. Don't forget, Alex, no one has ever held accountable for 9-11.
[3:40:13.000 --> 3:40:18.840]  And you know, I said, I don't look at Mr. Brennan doing what he's doing right now akin to Bernie
[3:40:18.840 --> 3:40:23.480]  Madoff being brought back to investigate the damage he caused with his policy scheme. It's
[3:40:23.480 --> 3:40:29.160]  ludicrous. So what we got to do is if we only focus on one core issue, that issue needs to be
[3:40:29.160 --> 3:40:34.600]  accountability. If you don't, if you can't do the job, you need to be replaced. Exactly. Regardless
[3:40:34.600 --> 3:40:38.440]  of what happened, we know they screwed up. We know they knew beforehand and let it happen,
[3:40:38.440 --> 3:40:44.440]  bare minimum. For whatever reason, why are they now back in charge, getting away with everything?
[3:40:45.320 --> 3:40:50.840]  And why do you get rewarded for failure? And then people that actually did a good job, like
[3:40:50.840 --> 3:40:55.240]  yourself, no one denies you did a great job. You're being persecuted for trying to kill
[3:40:55.240 --> 3:41:00.120]  Osama bin Laden. If he supposedly, you know, is the guy over at LCI ADA that was involved
[3:41:00.760 --> 3:41:06.680]  in all of this. And and now we see more and more of this used to take our liberties and our freedom.
[3:41:06.680 --> 3:41:11.720]  And again, on record, you do want a new investigation of 911. Absolutely. As a public
[3:41:11.720 --> 3:41:16.200]  supporter that I can't call for a new investigation. And I don't agree with everything that all the
[3:41:16.200 --> 3:41:19.800]  movements stand for out there. I think the one common issue, Alec, we all agree on,
[3:41:19.800 --> 3:41:24.040]  we need a new investigation. We need to really turn over all the rocks, get to the real bottom,
[3:41:24.040 --> 3:41:28.440]  and independent commission, not consisting of people who have agendas to sit down to go through
[3:41:28.440 --> 3:41:33.880]  everything in detail for a full accounting. And frankly, people need to be fired if they failed
[3:41:33.880 --> 3:41:38.680]  it to do, fail to conduct themselves in accordance with their oath of office. So
[3:41:39.960 --> 3:41:45.720]  Absolutely. Is there a website yet for the dark side of the force, the book coming out in the
[3:41:45.720 --> 3:41:49.160]  summer? No, there's not, but what you can do is, you know, I'm a senior fellow at the Center for
[3:41:49.160 --> 3:41:56.200]  Advanced Defense Studies, C4ADS.org. We do a combination of studies on technology and policies
[3:41:56.200 --> 3:42:01.560]  relating to defense. I do a lot of, you know, there are my things I got belong to. And obviously,
[3:42:01.560 --> 3:42:05.320]  I'll come back with you when we do have more information about the book. And I look forward
[3:42:05.320 --> 3:42:09.400]  to chatting with you guys in the future as things develop. Well, I'm flattered that you read
[3:42:09.400 --> 3:42:14.440]  Info Wars, Colonel. How long you been checking that out? Well, you know, it was one of the
[3:42:14.440 --> 3:42:19.160]  recommended to me very early on when I was doing Facebook last year. So I've been, I'm a fan of it.
[3:42:19.160 --> 3:42:23.240]  So I look at it all the time. Well, thank you so much, Colonel. Let me look forward to reading
[3:42:23.240 --> 3:42:27.960]  your new book and look forward to having you back on. Be safe, sir. Thank you. Thank you. Take care.
[3:42:27.960 --> 3:42:36.040]  You bet. Goodbye. Okay. Well, there you go, ladies and gentlemen. Talking to that guy
[3:42:36.040 --> 3:42:39.240]  off air is interesting. He hadn't told me anything secret or anything. He just,
[3:42:39.240 --> 3:42:46.840]  he just certainly is telling you as much as he can. And he likes what we do. He likes the films
[3:42:46.840 --> 3:42:52.440]  and the material and the information. And what does that tell you? A big black op commander
[3:42:52.440 --> 3:42:58.840]  telling you they could have wiped out every one of the supposed Al Qaeda commanders long before
[3:42:58.840 --> 3:43:04.360]  9 11 and they weren't allowed to. And either was the FBI here in the US and Israeli intelligence
[3:43:04.360 --> 3:43:12.200]  was literally handling them all over them. The FBI was all over them. It looks from the best we
[3:43:12.200 --> 3:43:20.040]  can tell with the seven seven bombings and with the 9 11 operations and with the underwear bomber,
[3:43:20.040 --> 3:43:25.320]  they get useful idiots who think they're part of drills. And in some cases they get real terrorists
[3:43:25.320 --> 3:43:30.840]  who are being handled by international crime syndicate, private networks, mole operators
[3:43:30.840 --> 3:43:34.760]  who allow them to carry out these attacks. And then some events are completely staged
[3:43:34.760 --> 3:43:38.200]  like Gulf of Tonkin that didn't even happen. And they just say, Oh, we got to go to war.
[3:43:39.160 --> 3:43:41.880]  But there certainly are real Muslim terrorists out there.
[3:43:43.640 --> 3:43:47.400]  You know, they would call themselves fighters against Western occupation. But regardless,
[3:43:47.400 --> 3:43:54.600]  there are real asymmetrical people out there attacking in nontraditional military operations.
[3:43:55.720 --> 3:44:01.960]  But most when you see a terror attack and it's got earmarks of intelligence protecting it in the
[3:44:01.960 --> 3:44:07.720]  West and you see a simultaneous rollout for a new war in Yemen and a new rollout of body
[3:44:07.720 --> 3:44:13.320]  scanners that homeland security is all making money off of privately openly criminally in a
[3:44:13.320 --> 3:44:19.480]  revolving door of looting like shirt off. When you see all that happening simultaneously and it
[3:44:19.480 --> 3:44:24.680]  fits the MO of everything you've seen over and over and over and over again, you know what's
[3:44:24.680 --> 3:44:29.640]  going on. And Colonel Schaefer didn't get into all the persecution he went through all the things
[3:44:29.640 --> 3:44:36.440]  they tried to do to him when he went to him and said, Yeah, you know, you and take Sybil Edmonds
[3:44:36.440 --> 3:44:43.400]  who we've interviewed. Sybil Edmonds, she's listening to the NSA CIA intercepts reading them at FBI,
[3:44:43.400 --> 3:44:51.080]  transcribing them from Arabic and Farsi and the rest of it over into English for the FBI
[3:44:51.080 --> 3:44:56.120]  analyst to read it. And it's elements of the CIA and she's now gone to federal court and
[3:44:56.120 --> 3:44:59.640]  broken her gag order because she was called in another case was able to talk about it.
[3:44:59.640 --> 3:45:07.560]  And she said narcotics running child kidnapping, sex slave weapons with al-Qaeda and elements of
[3:45:07.560 --> 3:45:15.160]  the CIA and private contractors. Remember that. And she said this years ago, she put a lot of
[3:45:15.160 --> 3:45:20.520]  it out here on the show. And then in the last year came out with all of it. And she said the CIA
[3:45:20.520 --> 3:45:30.200]  was running al-Qaeda right up until 9 11. So of course, the CIA didn't want the Pentagon and
[3:45:30.200 --> 3:45:36.840]  sent calm and special forces operators in the green berets to be able to go out and kill
[3:45:38.200 --> 3:45:44.840]  their al-Qaeda frontmen who themselves were just cutouts for this whole operation because we have
[3:45:44.840 --> 3:45:50.200]  enough declassified operations from decades past to know what this operation is. And it fits all
[3:45:50.200 --> 3:45:55.240]  the pieces fit perfectly. We know what happened. And the goal is take American liberty, set up a
[3:45:55.240 --> 3:46:01.560]  police state, launch all these new wars, start a clash of civilizations. Everything the PNAC report
[3:46:01.560 --> 3:46:10.600]  wrote about the Pentagon minions Dick Cheney and Jeb Bush and others wrote about in September 20
[3:46:10.600 --> 3:46:15.400]  of 2000, rebuilding America's defenses of white paper issued by the project for a new American
[3:46:15.400 --> 3:46:21.720]  century. And they say if we don't have a big Pearl Harbor terror attack, notice Pearl Harbor
[3:46:21.720 --> 3:46:27.480]  killed 3,911 killed 3,000. If we don't have that, we're not going to be able to launch Pax Americana,
[3:46:27.480 --> 3:46:32.040]  the empire of America, but it's not an empire we own or we get. Let's say we're a moral evil
[3:46:32.040 --> 3:46:36.200]  piratical demons, which we're not the average American, you know, the government said we're
[3:46:36.200 --> 3:46:41.880]  evil. We're the forces of doom. We're going to take over the planet. Most of the military and
[3:46:41.880 --> 3:46:47.400]  people wouldn't go along with that. But even if you are evil and believe you got some goodies,
[3:46:47.400 --> 3:46:53.560]  you didn't get cheaper oil. You got higher taxes. You paid for a private corporate war over opium
[3:46:53.560 --> 3:47:00.040]  and oil and weapons and everything else. You paid for a war that helped global interest destroy
[3:47:00.040 --> 3:47:04.760]  America's sovereignty. I mean, if you really believe Muslims are the greatest evil on the earth,
[3:47:04.760 --> 3:47:08.760]  why are they bringing record numbers of them into the country? Why do they protect them with the
[3:47:08.760 --> 3:47:16.120]  Fort Hood and the underwear bomber and every single case right down the line? Why is the FBI
[3:47:16.120 --> 3:47:20.920]  protecting them in their homes? Why are the Israelis protecting them? Why do the major
[3:47:20.920 --> 3:47:25.960]  white supremacist groups every time in the U.S. get caught being run by the feds founded by the
[3:47:25.960 --> 3:47:32.360]  feds? They want to radicalize the political debate to make the empire look good. If you're
[3:47:32.360 --> 3:47:37.880]  against the private federal reserve, you must be a Nazi. If you're against the wars and the
[3:47:37.880 --> 3:47:42.440]  globalist, oh, you must be a Muslim extremist. See how they do that? And so that's why they run
[3:47:42.440 --> 3:47:46.760]  the radical Muslims and protect them and shepherd them depending on what variety they are, whether
[3:47:46.760 --> 3:47:52.200]  they're real or manufactured. There's all different types in this grab bag. It's the same thing with
[3:47:52.200 --> 3:47:58.360]  the white supremacist. That's why the white supremacist attack me number one because they
[3:47:58.360 --> 3:48:05.880]  are a federal body. How Turner is a FBI agent, national security branch confirmed in federal
[3:48:05.880 --> 3:48:11.560]  court last week with the FBI defending him and calling for the case to be dropped.
[3:48:13.080 --> 3:48:19.960]  The U.S. attorney defending him as a great soldier of the FBI. He made a mistake, though,
[3:48:19.960 --> 3:48:25.480]  in his operations. A bunch of state judges got mad when he started telling people to go after them.
[3:48:25.480 --> 3:48:31.800]  The state still have power and these judges go, I don't care. This is an FBI operation. You don't
[3:48:31.800 --> 3:48:37.800]  have your operative get up there and say, come after me. And so he's been indicted in multiple
[3:48:37.800 --> 3:48:44.360]  states and the FBI comes in and says he is an agent. He is deep cover and they say, okay, what
[3:48:44.360 --> 3:48:51.160]  division? National security branch, highest level security. I mean, in fact, go to Curt
[3:48:51.160 --> 3:48:56.920]  Nemo's article that links to the Hal Turner family blog, the Chicago Tribune, the Boston Globe.
[3:48:56.920 --> 3:49:01.800]  The headline was Hal Turner, national security asset. But when you actually read the transcript,
[3:49:01.800 --> 3:49:08.760]  most of it's blacked out, it says he is a FBI national security agent. He is an agent. And
[3:49:08.760 --> 3:49:17.400]  who did he attack every day? Me. Who are the FBI and CIA attacking? Me. Because I'll have people
[3:49:17.400 --> 3:49:21.640]  on like Colonel Shaffer to tell the truth. There's the article. Put it up on screen. Hal Turner is
[3:49:21.640 --> 3:49:27.560]  a national security asset. And you scroll down, you scroll down on the article and in it,
[3:49:29.080 --> 3:49:34.440]  punch it up on screen for me for prisonplanet.tv viewers or anybody can go read it. When you
[3:49:34.440 --> 3:49:39.880]  scroll down, we have the PDFs blacked out under national security, but the parts that aren't
[3:49:39.880 --> 3:49:48.520]  blacked out say FBI agent, highest security clearance, national security. Are you guys able
[3:49:48.520 --> 3:49:55.160]  to scroll that down? Because I just want to scroll it down. Yeah, the article. Perfect.
[3:49:55.160 --> 3:49:58.680]  Just scroll it down and see those documents. Click on those.
[3:50:01.800 --> 3:50:08.360]  You can blow those documents up and that is from the federal court. The Hal Turner family blog
[3:50:08.360 --> 3:50:14.600]  and the Chicago Tribune directly link to the federal and state courthouses.
[3:50:14.600 --> 3:50:25.000]  And there it is where you can read national security intelligence, terrorism,
[3:50:25.000 --> 3:50:30.360]  foreign counterintelligence. And then you scroll down to the next document. It says he was an agent.
[3:50:30.920 --> 3:50:34.680]  And every one of these major groups, see how it's redacted right there,
[3:50:35.560 --> 3:50:42.360]  every one of these groups are run by these people because that's why what does Chris Matthews do?
[3:50:42.360 --> 3:50:46.280]  Oh, I don't want socialism and government health care. That's code word for racism.
[3:50:46.280 --> 3:50:51.800]  Ron Paul says, I don't want to launch new wars. Oh, you're in any semi. They have to
[3:50:52.760 --> 3:50:58.680]  radicalize the debate so that mainline Americans don't wake up to this. They have to put a turd
[3:50:58.680 --> 3:51:05.240]  in the punch bowl on every issue of white supremacist activity. That guy is an FBI agent right there.
[3:51:06.360 --> 3:51:11.080]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions. If you're going into a battle and
[3:51:11.080 --> 3:51:15.960]  they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want? My answer would be all
[3:51:15.960 --> 3:51:21.800]  I can get in the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones. Food is your only ammunition.
[3:51:21.800 --> 3:51:27.080]  How much do you want? When do you want it now or after the battle starts? When will you need it?
[3:51:27.080 --> 3:51:31.720]  Can you buy it without proper identification? Will there be any food? Will it make your children
[3:51:31.720 --> 3:51:36.280]  sick if there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself? Will you go to the gathering center
[3:51:36.280 --> 3:51:41.640]  and be immunized? You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply. Food is your
[3:51:41.640 --> 3:51:46.840]  ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life. How much will you need? We don't know.
[3:51:46.840 --> 3:51:51.960]  How much do you want all you can get? I'm Alex Jones. I want all of you good guys to live to
[3:51:51.960 --> 3:52:00.840]  fight another day. Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at eFoodsDirect.com. Again,
[3:52:00.840 --> 3:52:10.840]  that number, 1-800-409-5633. Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[3:52:10.840 --> 3:52:15.560]  This is our last chance to not relive history. As we're finishing off this agenda,
[3:52:16.440 --> 3:52:21.640]  we're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home. We have tremendous influence on our
[3:52:21.640 --> 3:52:28.120]  president and Congress and they really are calling the shots. I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[3:52:28.120 --> 3:52:33.720]  as American citizens to pay attention. Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation,
[3:52:33.720 --> 3:52:40.120]  the criminal offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world
[3:52:40.120 --> 3:52:44.520]  government. Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists. They're asking for more matches
[3:52:44.520 --> 3:52:49.080]  and the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to? Today seems like nobody does care
[3:52:49.080 --> 3:52:55.720]  and right now in Washington DC, we have seen a fall of the Republic. Get your copy of Fall of
[3:52:55.720 --> 3:53:02.680]  the Republic on DVD at infowars.com. We're watching online right now in super high quality at

[3:54:11.320 --> 3:54:19.160]  Rob Jacobson, one of my video editors, got points on his license and was sent a bill for a ticket
[3:54:19.160 --> 3:54:25.480]  and auto accident he never had. And they just said, we'll arrest you. Derek, one of our salesmen,
[3:54:25.480 --> 3:54:31.640]  paid for a speeding ticket over a month ago. He has the receipt. They just lost it and they called
[3:54:31.640 --> 3:54:36.840]  him just now and said, we're going to come arrest you if you don't come prove that you paid this
[3:54:36.840 --> 3:54:40.680]  ticket. See, the government just does whatever it wants and I've got all these Boy Scout parents
[3:54:40.680 --> 3:54:45.800]  in denial from fall of republic and other films I've made showing how they're being federalized
[3:54:45.800 --> 3:54:49.640]  and taken over by local police as well, going, well, they've always trained with law enforcement.
[3:54:49.640 --> 3:54:55.800]  No, they're being fully taken over and deployed at checkpoints and at malls. Here's one out of
[3:54:55.800 --> 3:55:01.640]  the Daily Journal. Explorer program exposes youth to law enforcement in police uniforms,
[3:55:01.640 --> 3:55:11.880]  out searching people at the mall, the Eugen. Okay, here's another one. Irma Boy Scout troop
[3:55:11.880 --> 3:55:18.280]  first in state to get new law enforcement patch. These are pouring in major police departments
[3:55:18.280 --> 3:55:24.440]  under federal grants are taking over the Boy Scouts. Parents say no to this man. This is
[3:55:24.440 --> 3:55:30.840]  Soviet Russia, Nazi Germany. Stop living in denial. I know what's going on. There's nothing wrong
[3:55:30.840 --> 3:55:35.960]  with that. Okay, you people really need to wake up out there. This was an incredible week. This was
[3:55:35.960 --> 3:55:41.240]  the best week of radio, full five shows we've ever done. I want to commend the crew, the best crew
[3:55:41.240 --> 3:55:46.440]  I've ever had. I want to commend the IT people, Genesis, everybody, the sponsors, the affiliates.
[3:55:47.640 --> 3:55:52.120]  I'll be back Sunday live four to six PM. Just amazing job to everybody. I want to encourage
[3:55:52.120 --> 3:55:58.920]  everyone to continue to visit the online video bookstore at info wars.com to get the materials.
[3:55:58.920 --> 3:56:04.280]  America is ready to be woken up in the first hour. We covered a bunch of key news and I had
[3:56:04.280 --> 3:56:09.560]  about 12 plus percent of kids being sexually abused in government custody. We're also going to have
[3:56:10.520 --> 3:56:15.560]  Damon Vickers on Bob Chapman. And then of course, the able danger, uh, Colonel Schaefer interview.
[3:56:15.560 --> 3:56:19.560]  I mean, and we've got interviews next week. It just gets more and more powerful,
[3:56:19.560 --> 3:56:23.720]  more and more informative. The Drudge report has added info wars as a permanent link. Thank
[3:56:23.720 --> 3:56:29.880]  them for that. And they're new top news sources. I mean, this is incredible. We are breaking through
[3:56:29.880 --> 3:56:35.000]  at every level. What we're talking about is now become mainstream. We can take, we can defeat
[3:56:35.000 --> 3:56:41.800]  the new world order together. But, um, as people are finding out, we knew what we were talking
[3:56:41.800 --> 3:56:46.440]  about. We're right. We're the Patriots. We're the good guys. We're anti new world order. The new
[3:56:46.440 --> 3:56:51.400]  order is the enemy and closing. I want to tell you about a few of the sponsors that have made
