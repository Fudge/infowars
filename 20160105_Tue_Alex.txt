[00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:06.660]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:08.421]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.421 --> 00:00:10.183]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.183 --> 00:00:11.764]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.764 --> 00:00:13.305]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.305 --> 00:00:17.508]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.508 --> 00:00:21.571]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:25.394 --> 00:00:29.556]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is already Tuesday, the fifth day of January 2016.
[00:00:29.556 --> 00:00:48.686]  I'm Alex Jones coming to you live from Phoenix as we broadcast worldwide on both radio and television, and of course streaming over the web at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com, back at the InfoWars News Studios in Austin, Texas.
[00:00:49.526 --> 00:00:59.001]  We have David Knight who's going to be riding shotgun with us today, and we have several big guests joining us as well.
[00:00:59.001 --> 00:01:04.789]  One of them, Wayne Madsen, investigative journalist that works for Infowars.com, put out a big detailed report.
[00:01:05.728 --> 00:01:24.103]  That I need to instantly print that I saw on Infowars.com showing the massive persecution of Christians in 2016 and 2015 with the current funding worldwide of George Soros actually funding the persecution of Christians by radical Muslims all over the world.
[00:01:24.103 --> 00:01:29.967]  It just shows the unprecedented war on Christians and why they've opened up the borders to Europe and more.
[00:01:29.967 --> 00:01:31.248]  So we'll be focusing in on that.
[00:01:31.248 --> 00:01:33.971]  Obviously massive stock market sinking.
[00:01:34.971 --> 00:01:38.954]  In the new year, hundreds and hundreds of points per day since last Friday.
[00:01:38.954 --> 00:01:45.699]  We're going to be breaking that down several hundred points down on the Dow Jones Industrial Averages today.
[00:01:45.699 --> 00:01:52.004]  We see the Globalist openly trying to start a Muslim civil war between Shiites and Sunnis.
[00:01:52.004 --> 00:01:57.368]  They've basically started a giant one, but they want to start a huge world war out of this.
[00:01:57.368 --> 00:01:59.390]  Just huge situation.
[00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:02.833]  Saudis cut ties to Iran as crisis intensifies.
[00:02:03.813 --> 00:02:06.074]  Federal raids, quote, round up immigrants.
[00:02:06.074 --> 00:02:07.314]  This is a stunt.
[00:02:07.314 --> 00:02:13.295]  They're bringing in tens of millions every few months, every six months or so, over a million total.
[00:02:13.295 --> 00:02:23.877]  But if you look at the aggregate, 40 million illegals or more in the country, and they do a few of these stunts a few times a year to act like we've got some type of internal security.
[00:02:23.877 --> 00:02:27.218]  We're going to be getting to that as well.
[00:02:27.218 --> 00:02:32.419]  And then, obviously, what's been one of the biggest stories in the country,
[00:02:33.686 --> 00:02:42.372]  And now in the world, right on time, Feds tread lightly versus armed Oregon grab.
[00:02:42.372 --> 00:02:50.657]  And of course it's the Feds that are really grabbing the property in Oregon, but this is the optics that we have basically in every major newspaper in the country today.
[00:02:50.657 --> 00:02:53.439]  Not that Obama is currently speaking.
[00:02:53.439 --> 00:02:54.780]  We can put him up on screen.
[00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:55.560]  We're monitoring him.
[00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:59.703]  We have the press release this morning of what the executive order is.
[00:02:59.703 --> 00:03:01.524]  The stories are on InfoWars.com.
[00:03:03.012 --> 00:03:05.093]  It's been DrugsReport.com.
[00:03:05.093 --> 00:03:11.596]  New Obama gun rules require those selling even a single firearm to become licensed dealers.
[00:03:11.596 --> 00:03:21.041]  That is a national, national gun registry, and we know what comes next in every single case.
[00:03:21.041 --> 00:03:23.522]  We're going to get Ted Nugent on in the next few days.
[00:03:23.522 --> 00:03:26.043]  We're going to get Wayne LaPierre on in the next few days.
[00:03:26.043 --> 00:03:28.884]  We're going to get the head of Gun Owners of America back on in the next few days.
[00:03:28.884 --> 00:03:30.005]  David, I interviewed him last week.
[00:03:31.369 --> 00:03:35.571]  Warning us this was all coming but here it is and they're saying more is coming after this.
[00:03:35.571 --> 00:03:45.136]  So I was thinking the Draconian National Registry would be in a few months after he tested the power grab of it being just an executive order outside of law.
[00:03:45.136 --> 00:03:47.097]  We already have taxes outside of law.
[00:03:47.097 --> 00:03:49.198]  We already have power plants being shut down outside of law.
[00:03:49.198 --> 00:03:52.479]  We already have illegals being brought in outside of law.
[00:03:52.479 --> 00:03:53.760]  The point is outside of law.
[00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:54.300]  We all have
[00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:58.102]  Al-Qaeda and ISIS and al-Nusra being funded outside of law.
[00:03:58.102 --> 00:04:02.465]  That's really the big enchilada here, is this is outside of Congress.
[00:04:02.465 --> 00:04:09.670]  And then you got the Supreme Court making laws after they're blackmailed that, oh, we can have taxes for foreign insurance companies where you pay them.
[00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:11.952]  It's a tax to insurance companies.
[00:04:11.952 --> 00:04:13.553]  I mean, the screw job is on.
[00:04:14.838 --> 00:04:16.340]  The screw job is on.
[00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:16.901]  It's here.
[00:04:16.901 --> 00:04:18.903]  National Registry.
[00:04:18.903 --> 00:04:21.426]  That's what Politico's saying.
[00:04:21.426 --> 00:04:24.149]  That's what World Net Daily is saying.
[00:04:24.149 --> 00:04:26.712]  That's what the NRA is saying.
[00:04:26.712 --> 00:04:28.214]  That's what Obama is saying.
[00:04:28.214 --> 00:04:31.338]  And they're like, reasonable, you know, within his power, he can do it.
[00:04:31.338 --> 00:04:33.721]  And then, why am I here in Phoenix?
[00:04:34.802 --> 00:04:51.035]  I had an over-the-top, powerful, two-hour interview with Louis Farrakhan yesterday, where he's on the same page believing they're trying to start a race war in America, and I'm reaching out, because he's so influential, to try to make sure this doesn't happen and George Soros doesn't get what he wants.
[00:04:51.035 --> 00:04:51.315]  Stay with us.
[00:04:59.491 --> 00:05:11.956]  While President Obama attempts to enact gun control via executive action, a new Gallup poll shows that only 2% of Americans believe that guns or gun control are among the country's top problems.
[00:05:11.956 --> 00:05:19.038]  Gallup asked about 1,000 Americans in all 50 states what they thought the nation's top problems were in 2015.
[00:05:19.038 --> 00:05:25.641]  And out of 23 problems mentioned by Americans, guns, gun control ranked near the bottom at 19th.
[00:05:25.641 --> 00:05:26.421]  In comparison,
[00:05:26.821 --> 00:05:31.144]  Sixteen percent of Americans said that the government was the nation's biggest issue.
[00:05:31.144 --> 00:05:33.345]  Thirteen percent said the economy.
[00:05:33.345 --> 00:05:37.268]  Eight percent said unemployment, and another eight said immigration.
[00:05:37.268 --> 00:05:52.698]  But rather than working on these hot-button issues, both President Obama and the mainstream media would rather focus on gun control, with a president even stating that he wants to, quote, make gun control part of his legacy, end quote, according to CNN.
[00:05:52.698 --> 00:05:56.401]  You can find more reports on InfoWars.com.
[00:05:59.162 --> 00:06:02.664]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[00:06:02.664 --> 00:06:07.466]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors,
[00:06:08.459 --> 00:06:08.839]  I don't know.
[00:06:29.068 --> 00:06:30.188]  Brain Force is here.
[00:06:30.188 --> 00:06:32.389]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[00:06:32.389 --> 00:06:37.371]  You've probably noticed I've been more focused, less brain fog, more energy, and it's because of Brain Force.
[00:06:37.371 --> 00:06:40.673]  There's always hidden additives in your food, even organic food has hidden additives.
[00:06:40.673 --> 00:06:44.154]  Staring at the computer all day, working, doing good, you're still damaging your brain.
[00:06:44.154 --> 00:06:45.895]  Ultimately, we've all been dumbed down to some degree.
[00:06:46.135 --> 00:06:48.256]  It doesn't have stimulants, it doesn't have garbage in it.
[00:06:48.256 --> 00:06:50.236]  It has natural things that do it clean.
[00:06:50.236 --> 00:06:56.838]  You will find Brain Force and other game-changing products at Infowarslife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[00:06:56.838 --> 00:07:00.479]  It has happened.
[00:07:00.479 --> 00:07:04.100]  2015 has passed into history, into lore.
[00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:07.421]  But now, 2016 has been born.
[00:07:07.421 --> 00:07:11.102]  And the decision lies in your hands to forge the destiny.
[00:07:12.462 --> 00:07:13.462]  Whoa, whoa, whoa!
[00:07:13.462 --> 00:07:18.084]  That's a little too epic, that Hollywood action-adventure science-fiction voice I'm using.
[00:07:18.084 --> 00:07:26.667]  But quite frankly, that's how I feel like I should be talking about what happens when your body actually gets the real natural nutrients it needs.
[00:07:26.667 --> 00:07:33.369]  And that's why we're offering the biggest discount ever on three of our best-selling products that turbocharge and cleanse the body.
[00:07:33.369 --> 00:07:41.732]  It's Survival Shield X2 Nascent Iodine, the all-in-one cleansing formula Deep Cleanse, and Secret 12 Methylcobalamin, vitamin B12, for the lowest price ever.

[00:07:52.345 --> 00:07:53.247]  I just did it again.
[00:07:53.247 --> 00:07:54.748]  I can't help but get excited.
[00:07:54.748 --> 00:07:55.589]  Get healthy!
[00:07:55.589 --> 00:07:56.631]  Fight the globalists!
[00:07:56.631 --> 00:07:57.452]  Win-win!
[00:07:57.452 --> 00:07:58.053]  Yeah!
[00:08:10.652 --> 00:08:14.241]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[00:08:14.241 --> 00:08:18.411]  It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:29.770 --> 00:08:37.131]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for joining us on this Live Tuesday Worldwide Broadcast.
[00:08:37.131 --> 00:08:43.533]  I am your host, Alex Jones, and I am coming to you from Phoenix, Arizona.
[00:08:43.533 --> 00:08:51.034]  I will be getting on a plane later today and traveling back to the Infowars News Center in Austin, Texas.
[00:08:51.034 --> 00:08:58.956]  David Knight is riding shotgun there in the News Center and will give us breaking news, analysis, and information throughout the day.
[00:08:59.656 --> 00:09:19.246]  We also have Wayne Madsen, investigative journalist, Infowars.com reporter, who wrote a very important article yesterday at Infowars.com, chronicling in the last year the massive funding that George Soros has given to radical Muslim leaders, countries, and others to persecute the living hell out of Christians.
[00:09:19.246 --> 00:09:27.731]  You talk about serious crimes against humanity, this Nazi war collaborator who runs the Obama White House is just unbelievably
[00:09:28.451 --> 00:09:33.132]  Out of control and going out of his way to engage in massive persecution.
[00:09:33.132 --> 00:09:36.933]  Top 10 Soros targets in 2016.
[00:09:36.933 --> 00:09:39.213]  And then it goes through Christians.
[00:09:39.213 --> 00:09:48.576]  Soros will back the most anti-Christian, pro-Muslim regimes and leaders worldwide in hellish persecution and hellish operations in Europe as well.
[00:09:48.576 --> 00:09:53.957]  I mean, we are up against just absolute evil here, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:09:53.957 --> 00:09:54.797]  It is incredible.
[00:09:56.291 --> 00:10:00.220]  We're facing the class of civilizations, we're facing the globalists trying to stage a...
[00:10:01.696 --> 00:10:07.398]  Huge Muslim civil war, Shiite against Sunni and vice versa.
[00:10:07.398 --> 00:10:09.318]  That is in the news obviously today.
[00:10:09.318 --> 00:10:14.800]  We've been telling you this is all coming because this is the season of orchestrated crisis.
[00:10:14.800 --> 00:10:20.801]  This is the season of the stock market plunging, as you see it doing hundreds of points a day since Friday.
[00:10:20.801 --> 00:10:23.922]  This is the season of them coming for the guns.
[00:10:23.922 --> 00:10:29.224]  This is the season of them provocateuring and trying to push federal initiatives that are unconstitutional.
[00:10:29.804 --> 00:10:33.526]  So that people rightfully resist in their right.
[00:10:33.526 --> 00:10:35.987]  But is it the smart thing to do at this point?
[00:10:35.987 --> 00:10:39.909]  I say no unless you're defending yourself from an assault.
[00:10:39.909 --> 00:10:41.650]  It's all coming up today.
[00:10:41.650 --> 00:10:54.056]  Joe Biggs will also join us from the ground in Oregon where we have this empty federal barn or whatever that's been grabbed by folks that are mad about the federal land grabs.
[00:10:54.056 --> 00:10:56.317]  And again, you can look at both sides of this.
[00:10:56.317 --> 00:10:57.438]  The feds are out of control.
[00:10:57.438 --> 00:10:58.198]  They're grabbing land.
[00:10:58.198 --> 00:10:58.759]  It's under agenda 21.
[00:11:01.152 --> 00:11:05.534]  But at the same time, the Bundys were in the right with grazing rights back to the 1870s.
[00:11:05.534 --> 00:11:08.635]  We stood with them, we supported them.
[00:11:08.635 --> 00:11:18.218]  Now that the sheriff says, we don't want you, a lot of the locals say that, the Hammonds have said for three days, please don't speak for us.
[00:11:19.989 --> 00:11:25.631]  It just isn't as perfect an optics as we had in Southern Nevada.
[00:11:25.631 --> 00:11:33.594]  And the image of the feds putting their guns down and backing off if they threatened to shoot our reporter David Knight and others who were there with a thousand plus people.
[00:11:33.594 --> 00:11:36.675]  Now David Knight's son is on the ground.
[00:11:37.788 --> 00:11:41.130]  There, with Joe Biggs, covering all of this.
[00:11:41.130 --> 00:11:52.078]  Now remember, while we're all seeing every major newspaper in the country, including the Arizona Republic, where I sit in Phoenix, Arizona, feds tread lightly versus armed Oregon grab.
[00:11:52.078 --> 00:11:54.200]  It's the feds grabbing land.
[00:11:54.200 --> 00:11:57.782]  It's the feds that have 90% of states like Nevada.
[00:11:57.782 --> 00:11:59.984]  It's the feds that have more than half the country.
[00:11:59.984 --> 00:12:03.747]  It's the feds that are trying to take it off use and acting like the people are the enemy.
[00:12:03.747 --> 00:12:05.328]  It's the feds persecuting ranchers.
[00:12:06.707 --> 00:12:20.193]  It's the Feds wanting to get armored vehicles in local police departments and promoting this narrative that patriots, land rights groups, and others are about to come with guns and have a war, right?
[00:12:20.193 --> 00:12:29.717]  All of this kicking off Sunday into Monday when Obama announces, yesterday and today, National Registry, executive order outside of law.
[00:12:29.717 --> 00:12:31.758]  That's a huge issue that's outside of law.
[00:12:31.758 --> 00:12:35.920]  This is dictatorial, the very textbook totalitarian dictatorship.
[00:12:37.077 --> 00:12:42.049]  Of the presidency, Congress having its power stripped.
[00:12:42.984 --> 00:12:54.230]  The lapdog Supreme Court signaling it's about to rule against guns this year, already ruling last year that local cities can restrict guns down to the point of banning them, backing up Chicago and others.
[00:12:54.230 --> 00:12:55.811]  I mean, it's on, folks.
[00:12:55.811 --> 00:12:56.551]  It's on.
[00:12:56.551 --> 00:12:57.651]  It's on.
[00:12:57.651 --> 00:13:01.393]  InfoWars.com, WorldNetDaily, DrugsReport.com.
[00:13:01.393 --> 00:13:02.414]  We all have it broken down.
[00:13:02.414 --> 00:13:05.395]  In fact, I want to post the whole WorldNetDaily article at InfoWars.com.
[00:13:05.395 --> 00:13:06.656]  That's so important.
[00:13:06.656 --> 00:13:08.917]  National Registry.
[00:13:08.917 --> 00:13:09.838]  We have to get that out.
[00:13:10.640 --> 00:13:16.593]  To everyone, Obama executive orders may require those selling even a single firearm to become licensed dealers.
[00:13:16.593 --> 00:13:16.934]  Boom!
[00:13:18.237 --> 00:13:20.519]  This is what he just announced minutes ago.
[00:13:20.519 --> 00:13:22.921]  And he keeps saying reasonable, no big deal, no big deal.
[00:13:22.921 --> 00:13:25.583]  Like, it's reasonable to have forced inoculations.
[00:13:25.583 --> 00:13:28.285]  It's reasonable to double and triple your insurance prices.
[00:13:28.285 --> 00:13:31.408]  It's reasonable to teach five-year-olds how to have sex.
[00:13:31.408 --> 00:13:32.268]  No, it's not.
[00:13:32.268 --> 00:13:36.552]  This is what they're doing, just running over us, conditioning us.
[00:13:36.552 --> 00:13:38.393]  So we'll go back to that Breitbart headline.
[00:13:38.393 --> 00:13:39.815]  And we have the announcements.
[00:13:39.815 --> 00:13:44.699]  Obama's gun control plan includes gun ban for some Social Security beneficiaries.
[00:13:45.379 --> 00:13:46.080]  Absolutely.
[00:13:46.080 --> 00:13:51.964]  The FBI, and I'm not lionizing the FBI, but compared to the globalists and Obama, I mean, give me a break.
[00:13:51.964 --> 00:14:10.678]  The FBI came out last year and said, we've been told and we've been readied at the Nick Center and we're going to be directed by experts, quote, at the VA with a algorithm that we are to apply with a computer with the data of the Social Security recipients.
[00:14:10.678 --> 00:14:12.119]  How many millions are there?
[00:14:12.119 --> 00:14:12.880]  Sixty-something million?
[00:14:12.880 --> 00:14:13.661]  It's about to be a
[00:14:14.514 --> 00:14:16.235]  80-something million as baby boomers retire?
[00:14:16.235 --> 00:14:18.435]  I mean, in fact, Google that.
[00:14:18.435 --> 00:14:20.416]  How many Social Security recipients are there right now?
[00:14:20.416 --> 00:14:25.278]  I want to say it's like 68 million, 70 million, but I'm going from memory here.
[00:14:25.278 --> 00:14:35.702]  And if you do an automatic transfer, this is the Washington Post, this is the Washington Times, with a straight face, the New York Times, last year, just three or four months ago, remember?
[00:14:35.702 --> 00:14:36.182]  They said, hey,
[00:14:38.078 --> 00:14:42.921]  You take an automatic transfer of your Social Security, that means we declare you incompetent.
[00:14:42.921 --> 00:14:44.102]  Guess what they started this year?
[00:14:44.102 --> 00:14:50.567]  They're trying to make it mandatory to take automatic transfers, and if you don't, they're going to charge you a fee.
[00:14:50.567 --> 00:14:53.149]  And now, it's being reported by Politico.
[00:14:54.246 --> 00:14:56.427]  It's being reported by Politico.
[00:14:56.427 --> 00:15:01.590]  Doctors can report some mentally ill patients to FBI under new gun rule.
[00:15:01.590 --> 00:15:03.831]  You actually read what it says?
[00:15:03.831 --> 00:15:14.777]  Doctors can report you, even though you're seeing a dentist, you're seeing a clinic, you're seeing whatever, if they believe something might be going on and then no judge, no jury, you just lose your guns.
[00:15:14.777 --> 00:15:17.198]  And they ask kids now, pediatricians, do your parents have guns?
[00:15:17.198 --> 00:15:20.280]  If they say yes, they've seen the guns, the CPS is called.
[00:15:21.348 --> 00:15:22.889]  Department of Health and Human Services.
[00:15:22.889 --> 00:15:26.411]  He's going to launch all these different agencies outside of law.
[00:15:26.411 --> 00:15:33.756]  They've beta tested this in New York City, Chicago, and many areas of California, like LA.
[00:15:33.756 --> 00:15:35.298]  And they've beta tested it.
[00:15:35.298 --> 00:15:36.398]  We know the attack.
[00:15:36.398 --> 00:15:39.240]  We warned you with precision.
[00:15:39.240 --> 00:15:40.601]  Not because we're that smart.
[00:15:40.601 --> 00:15:42.643]  The enemy runs a big country.
[00:15:42.643 --> 00:15:44.784]  They've hijacked 330 million people.
[00:15:44.784 --> 00:15:47.206]  370, 380 million, you count the illegals.
[00:15:47.206 --> 00:15:48.226]  They know how to implement.
[00:15:48.226 --> 00:15:49.007]  There it is.
[00:15:49.007 --> 00:15:50.248]  A federal mental health
[00:15:52.940 --> 00:15:57.549]  That disqualifies them from shipping, transporting, possessing, or receiving a firearm.
[00:15:58.869 --> 00:16:05.992]  And they just decide, a magic psychology list, no judge, no jury, no adjudication that you're mentally ill.
[00:16:05.992 --> 00:16:15.335]  It's hard, you know, since the 70s and the one who flew over the cuckoo's nest and all those, you know, horrible things that happened, locking people up for no reason to involuntarily commit people.
[00:16:15.335 --> 00:16:16.716]  Well forget all that!
[00:16:16.716 --> 00:16:19.737]  We'll just put you on a no-gun-buy list or a mentally ill list.
[00:16:19.737 --> 00:16:22.458]  And of course they say that most gun owners are mentally ill.
[00:16:23.158 --> 00:16:28.723]  Alan Dershowitz went on CNN and said, Alex Jones is mentally ill, he should have his guns taken.
[00:16:28.723 --> 00:16:38.653]  It doesn't matter that I've never been convicted of even a misdemeanor other than pleading guilty to speeding, which is one of the lowest classes of that.
[00:16:39.665 --> 00:16:44.509]  I have never been convicted of anything above a $300 fine.
[00:16:44.509 --> 00:16:45.910]  Nothing.
[00:16:45.910 --> 00:16:46.950]  Nothing.
[00:16:46.950 --> 00:16:48.772]  I have never had a DWI.
[00:16:48.772 --> 00:16:53.855]  I have never been convicted of any crime.
[00:16:53.855 --> 00:16:55.757]  I've never been audited by the IRS.
[00:16:55.757 --> 00:17:00.620]  We've had them do some other probes and harassments, but not a classic audit alleging something.
[00:17:00.620 --> 00:17:01.061]  Nothing.
[00:17:01.061 --> 00:17:03.823]  I'm about as clean as you get.
[00:17:04.850 --> 00:17:06.972]  I've even stopped speeding, basically.
[00:17:06.972 --> 00:17:08.453]  Gosh, it's hard to do.
[00:17:08.453 --> 00:17:12.436]  But the point is, there's no point even having a fast car anymore.
[00:17:12.436 --> 00:17:15.619]  The whole point, though, is it doesn't matter that I'm Mr. Goody Two-Shoes.
[00:17:15.619 --> 00:17:18.021]  It doesn't matter I'm calling for peace in this country.
[00:17:18.021 --> 00:17:22.284]  It doesn't matter I'm calling for reconciliation with the police and local communities.
[00:17:22.284 --> 00:17:25.146]  It doesn't matter if I'm working for jobs in America.
[00:17:25.146 --> 00:17:27.688]  It doesn't matter if I'm working for lower taxes.
[00:17:27.688 --> 00:17:32.873]  We've got Obama and this gaggle of organized criminals that all have their own armed guards
[00:17:33.971 --> 00:17:37.272]  And security paid for by the taxpayers.
[00:17:37.272 --> 00:17:44.914]  And he says we need a sense of urgency about gun violence when gun violence is down 60-something percent since 92.
[00:17:44.914 --> 00:17:48.335]  Professor Locke, correct me, it's not 52 percent, it's like 61 percent.
[00:17:48.335 --> 00:17:52.317]  And we can show you those statistics from FBI.gov, folks.
[00:17:52.317 --> 00:17:56.798]  We can show you the articles, but they are coming with their jihad, not about
[00:17:57.378 --> 00:18:08.769]  The economy imploding, not about all the tyranny, not about all the wars, not about our government funding radical Al-Qaeda and ISIS groups in the civil war, to kick off a civil war, to kick off a war between Iran and Saudi Arabia.
[00:18:08.769 --> 00:18:09.729]  None of that matters.
[00:18:09.729 --> 00:18:12.172]  It's all about gun owners in America.
[00:18:12.172 --> 00:18:18.638]  That's the big distraction, even though in a national Gallup poll I saw yesterday, 1% or was it 2% will pull it up.
[00:18:19.258 --> 00:18:24.703]  Of Americans believe that gun control is the number one issue that they're concerned with.
[00:18:24.703 --> 00:18:27.205]  They can't even get 5%, folks.
[00:18:27.205 --> 00:18:30.848]  And by the way, the number on Social Security?
[00:18:30.848 --> 00:18:32.630]  59 million Americans.
[00:18:32.630 --> 00:18:34.291]  I know it was around 60 million.
[00:18:34.291 --> 00:18:35.612]  But they're adding more all the time.
[00:18:35.612 --> 00:18:40.917]  I think within, what, two years it'll be 68 million and then upwards of 80 million by the end of the next decade.
[00:18:42.822 --> 00:18:48.307]  So, 59 million people, and most of you get automatic money transfers, they're coming for your guns.
[00:18:48.307 --> 00:18:51.710]  And they'll go, okay, you can have them, just go to a psychological.
[00:18:51.710 --> 00:18:56.994]  Just like you think it was fun to be a veteran and put through psychologicals to get your quote benefits that you earned?
[00:18:56.994 --> 00:19:00.277]  Now you're going to be harassed in the social services net.
[00:19:00.277 --> 00:19:01.278]  They're coming.
[00:19:01.278 --> 00:19:02.939]  They're coming with their agents.
[00:19:02.939 --> 00:19:04.541]  They're coming with their operatives.
[00:19:04.541 --> 00:19:08.084]  And bending over and groveling to it will only let them win.
[00:19:09.451 --> 00:19:12.673]  Gun ban for some social security beneficiaries.
[00:19:12.673 --> 00:19:13.794]  Boom!
[00:19:13.794 --> 00:19:14.254]  Boom!
[00:19:14.254 --> 00:19:16.395]  I mean, it is on.
[00:19:16.395 --> 00:19:17.596]  They are coming.
[00:19:17.596 --> 00:19:19.037]  They've got their battle march.
[00:19:19.037 --> 00:19:20.598]  They're not backing down.
[00:19:20.598 --> 00:19:28.183]  And Infowars.com is full tilt focused right now on the great gun ban has begun.
[00:19:28.183 --> 00:19:31.685]  I want everybody from Paul Joseph Watson to Adon Salazar
[00:19:32.245 --> 00:19:37.188]  McHale fell into Kit Daniels to hit every angle of this gun grab and put it all together.
[00:19:37.188 --> 00:19:52.877]  I would take all these articles that cover one issue each and then just headline the, you know, the, you know, emergency alert, total assault on the Second Amendment launched, and then just break down the seven different things currently they're doing.
[00:19:52.877 --> 00:19:57.200]  This is it, like 1776, they are coming for the guns.
[00:19:57.200 --> 00:19:58.841]  This is only the beginning.
[00:19:58.841 --> 00:19:59.241]  We warn
[00:19:59.641 --> 00:20:06.708]  Something just happened that has explained why survival food is literally flying off the shelves and has sold out in many areas of the country.
[00:20:06.708 --> 00:20:10.692]  It caught me totally by surprise, and it involves FEMA.
[00:20:10.692 --> 00:20:14.116]  I couldn't believe FEMA tried this until I saw proof.
[00:20:14.116 --> 00:20:19.201]  Revealing their secret could land me in hot water, but I think you deserve to know exactly what they're doing.
[00:20:19.781 --> 00:20:24.145]  Watch the viral video at FEMA3.com before it disappears again.
[00:20:24.145 --> 00:20:30.310]  But be warned, it's really disturbing because the fact is, they must know something we don't.
[00:20:30.310 --> 00:20:40.339]  Go to FEMA3.com to see the number one item you should be hoarding and why supplies of this critical item are so low or even completely sold out at many stores across America.
[00:20:41.039 --> 00:20:42.260]  Don't miss out.
[00:20:42.260 --> 00:20:47.464]  Watch the controversial video that thousands of other smart patriots have already seen in recent days.

[00:21:03.433 --> 00:21:06.694]  It takes just 10 seconds for an intruder to kick in your door.

[00:21:10.695 --> 00:21:13.876]  And intruders are in and out of your home in 5 minutes.
[00:21:13.876 --> 00:21:18.377]  Thieves know that you're not home and have presence inside just waiting to be taken.
[00:21:18.377 --> 00:21:23.579]  And if you are home, how safe will you feel with an intruder lurking inside with your family?
[00:21:23.999 --> 00:21:28.261]  That's why police across the country are recommending you use door armor.

[00:24:14.253 --> 00:24:18.335]  I'll be back in Austin, Lord willing, tonight.
[00:24:18.335 --> 00:24:32.681]  We are seeing an unprecedented development right now with President Obama launching a raft of anti-gun initiatives through federal agencies outside of law.
[00:24:35.458 --> 00:24:57.168]  Having social security recipients who get wire transfers of their money, which they try to push you to do, having their guns taken and being given psychological evaluations, claiming that they are inept or that they have been declared incompetent outside of law or judification.
[00:24:58.413 --> 00:25:18.189]  Doctors spying on their patients and just saying if they feel like it, under Department of Health and Human Services guidelines, kind of like the BLM just grabs land under guidelines, or Obama shuts down power plants under guidelines, or Obama opens up borders outside of law with guidelines that just come out of thin air, they will now take your guns via guidelines.
[00:25:18.189 --> 00:25:22.933]  He's announcing executive orders to ban the transference of any guns outside of there being a record.
[00:25:22.933 --> 00:25:26.896]  That's a gun registration unprecedented.
[00:25:29.856 --> 00:25:32.598]  It goes on and on and on.
[00:25:32.598 --> 00:25:35.939]  This is the strategy to destroy the Second Amendment.
[00:25:35.939 --> 00:25:44.584]  And then when there's another shooting, which there will always be in a country of 380 million people, counting the illegals.
[00:25:44.584 --> 00:25:45.924]  It's one of the rarest forms of death.
[00:25:45.924 --> 00:25:49.406]  I mean, we're talking 12,000 people a year die.
[00:25:51.633 --> 00:25:54.255]  Seven plus thousand are suicides.
[00:25:54.255 --> 00:25:57.798]  So we're talking about 5,000 or so that are killed.
[00:25:57.798 --> 00:25:59.019]  That sounds like a lot.
[00:25:59.019 --> 00:26:01.542]  Hundreds of thousands die on the highways.
[00:26:01.542 --> 00:26:03.823]  Tens of thousands fall and die in the shower.
[00:26:03.823 --> 00:26:07.006]  Your shower is more dangerous, on record.
[00:26:07.006 --> 00:26:09.789]  Your pool is more dangerous than guns.
[00:26:09.789 --> 00:26:11.270]  It is a phantom.
[00:26:11.270 --> 00:26:11.450]  L.A.
[00:26:11.450 --> 00:26:12.131]  Times headline.
[00:26:13.086 --> 00:26:15.467]  Gun, crime, way down.
[00:26:15.467 --> 00:26:16.928]  Public thinks it's way up.
[00:26:16.928 --> 00:26:18.248]  So this is a question.
[00:26:18.248 --> 00:26:21.249]  Will we have the triumph of disinformation?
[00:26:21.249 --> 00:26:30.453]  Will we have the triumph of fraud and the unparalleled, let's show some of the footage for TV viewers just minutes ago, Obama crying in a press conference.
[00:26:31.857 --> 00:26:38.202]  The guy that funded Al-Qaeda and ISIS to kill hundreds of thousands of innocent people in Syria and Libya.
[00:26:38.202 --> 00:26:40.944]  The guy that has double black unemployment.
[00:26:40.944 --> 00:26:45.727]  The guy that has raised all these different taxes on the poor people.
[00:26:45.727 --> 00:26:48.009]  The guy that could care less about the citizens.
[00:26:48.009 --> 00:26:50.271]  Just during the last segment, I saw you guys.
[00:26:50.271 --> 00:26:51.712]  We have a DVR.
[00:26:51.712 --> 00:26:53.814]  We were showing it.
[00:26:53.814 --> 00:26:55.875]  Obama up there fake crying.
[00:26:55.875 --> 00:26:56.716]  Do we have that?
[00:26:57.756 --> 00:27:04.485]  There it is, Obama cries during his rousing gun control speech, proving just how personal this issue is to him.
[00:27:04.485 --> 00:27:08.370]  How sick is that?
[00:27:08.370 --> 00:27:10.472]  Fake crying, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:27:11.852 --> 00:27:16.456]  The last time he faked crying, Drudge Report linked to my video on it, the media said he wasn't really crying.
[00:27:16.456 --> 00:27:17.296]  This is how they spin things.
[00:27:17.296 --> 00:27:20.198]  This is sick, fake crying.
[00:27:20.198 --> 00:27:22.120]  Crocodile tears.
[00:27:22.120 --> 00:27:29.305]  When he knows full well where there's gun abolition in Chicago and other areas, his supposed hometown, they have the highest crime rates in the world.
[00:27:29.305 --> 00:27:32.388]  They know they took all the guns from the people in Mexico 50-something years ago.
[00:27:32.388 --> 00:27:34.930]  Highest crime rate as a country on the planet.
[00:27:34.930 --> 00:27:37.612]  But highest crime rate for a city, Chicago.
[00:27:37.612 --> 00:27:40.674]  He's got all these armed guards, but he doesn't want you to have them, and then he...
[00:27:42.984 --> 00:27:44.344]  They want to conquer us.
[00:27:44.344 --> 00:27:45.985]  They want our guns.
[00:27:45.985 --> 00:27:48.845]  They've already conquered us with Obamacare financially.
[00:27:48.845 --> 00:27:50.465]  They've already broken our cities.
[00:27:50.465 --> 00:27:53.826]  They've already de-industrialized us and shipped our jobs overseas.
[00:27:53.826 --> 00:27:59.687]  And now they want to break the final pieces of America.
[00:27:59.687 --> 00:28:06.008]  And they want to start civil wars with Black Lives Matter, funded by Soros and others, to create instability there.
[00:28:06.008 --> 00:28:10.069]  And have the feds land grabbing out west and pushing people into confrontations there.
[00:28:11.360 --> 00:28:13.062]  It's incredible.
[00:28:13.062 --> 00:28:23.415]  But, now the media in USA Today, and the front page of the Oregonian, and everywhere else, has a new term.
[00:28:23.415 --> 00:28:25.978]  Hashtag Y'all-Kida.
[00:28:25.978 --> 00:28:27.140]  Y-A-L-L.
[00:28:31.508 --> 00:28:43.115]  And it's in the Associated Press that the Feds are going to shut the power off at the, quote, compound, the barn, the empty federal barn that they've moved into.
[00:28:43.115 --> 00:28:47.757]  When Occupy, all these other groups have taken over, you know, shopping malls and Mall of America.
[00:28:47.757 --> 00:28:51.439]  But, oh my gosh, Yale-Kida, it's white people with cowboy hats.
[00:28:51.439 --> 00:28:52.020]  They're evil.
[00:28:52.020 --> 00:28:52.480]  They're bad.
[00:28:52.480 --> 00:28:53.841]  Go after them.
[00:28:53.841 --> 00:28:55.422]  And then we knew this.
[00:28:55.422 --> 00:28:59.744]  Crybabies, infiltrators, spoiled brats, whatever, run up to Joe Biggs.
[00:28:59.744 --> 00:29:00.905]  People don't even know their names.
[00:29:01.929 --> 00:29:07.036]  And go, thanks a lot for Alex saying the Bundys are feds and saying I'm a fed, how dare you?
[00:29:07.036 --> 00:29:08.838]  You're the feds!
[00:29:08.838 --> 00:29:11.061]  See, just saying, watch out for infiltration.
[00:29:11.061 --> 00:29:13.024]  Just saying, hey, they try to infiltrate militias.
[00:29:13.024 --> 00:29:15.307]  Look out for anybody calling for violence.
[00:29:15.307 --> 00:29:18.911]  Then, it's the classic textbook turns into, I said they were all terrorists.
[00:29:20.205 --> 00:29:27.989]  You see how now they break up the patriots like that when we said no such thing, didn't say they were feds, said look out for feds trying to infiltrate and provocateur.
[00:29:27.989 --> 00:29:32.651]  And then the feds obviously come to him and say, did you hear what Alex said about you?
[00:29:32.651 --> 00:29:35.292]  And they go, no, he said you're a terrorist.
[00:29:35.292 --> 00:29:38.534]  And they go, he said I was a terrorist.
[00:29:38.534 --> 00:29:40.275]  He said I was a, how dare him?
[00:29:40.275 --> 00:29:43.076]  That's how they play you like fiddles.
[00:29:43.076 --> 00:29:48.039]  And the patriots love to take the bait every time till they throw you in federal prison.
[00:29:48.539 --> 00:29:52.461]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:29:52.461 --> 00:29:59.765]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:29:59.765 --> 00:30:11.251]  Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid wants the Federal Election Commission to make an exemption and allow him to pocket over $600,000 for retirement from a slush fund.
[00:30:11.251 --> 00:30:15.874]  FEC guidelines prohibit personal use of unspent PAC and campaign money.
[00:30:16.474 --> 00:30:23.060]  Punishment for violating the prohibition on personal use ranges from hefty fines to possible imprisonment.
[00:30:23.060 --> 00:30:28.865]  The money can be used as a contribution to charity or donated to the National Party Committee.
[00:30:28.865 --> 00:30:31.327]  Democrat FEC Chairwoman Ann Ravel.
[00:30:31.627 --> 00:30:40.133]  Believes Reed has the right to the money due to his status as a, quote, historic and important figure and public official, end quote.
[00:30:40.133 --> 00:30:44.016]  The FEC has deferred action on Reed's request.
[00:30:44.016 --> 00:30:51.081]  FEC Commissioner Lee E. Goodman believes granting the request will send the wrong message and set a precedent.
[00:30:51.081 --> 00:30:54.964]  You can find more reports on InfoWars.com.

[00:31:06.120 --> 00:31:09.002]  We've always offered five months free.

[00:31:58.962 --> 00:32:02.465]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[00:32:02.465 --> 00:32:10.711]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[00:32:10.711 --> 00:32:16.135]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.

[00:32:33.335 --> 00:32:37.498]  Introducing the new Infowarslife.com oil of oregano formulation.

[00:33:03.602 --> 00:33:19.725]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are back live.
[00:33:19.725 --> 00:33:23.546]  We're going to be breaking down the big move to destroy the Second Amendment that has been launched.
[00:33:23.546 --> 00:33:32.588]  An incredibly treacherous moment of pure evil by the Obama administration and the Soros crime syndicate that is attempting to overthrow this country.
[00:33:33.548 --> 00:33:40.552]  Eamon Bundy, one of the Bundy sons that is out in Oregon, is going to be interviewed this evening by Joe Biggs.
[00:33:40.552 --> 00:33:43.434]  So we'll have that report for the nightly news this evening.
[00:33:43.434 --> 00:33:51.278]  Joe Biggs will be popping in in the third hour from outside the compound, the feds are calling it.
[00:33:51.278 --> 00:33:56.101]  They're reporting that they're going to cut the, quote, power to it.
[00:33:56.101 --> 00:33:59.603]  And again, the controlled corporate press is calling them terrorists.
[00:34:00.103 --> 00:34:06.267]  We have clips of CNN saying this, and this goes back to Harry Reid calling the Bundys terrorists.
[00:34:06.267 --> 00:34:22.216]  We were very supportive of the Bundys and the folks that showed up out there and our reporters that covered it, and still dealt with disinformation agents for whatever reason, running around claiming that we hate the Bundys and, you know, hate everyone and think that land rights is horrible.
[00:34:22.216 --> 00:34:24.237]  And then, of course, the Bundys would go look it up.
[00:34:24.237 --> 00:34:25.218]  We never said any of that about them.
[00:34:26.716 --> 00:34:30.240]  In this case, we have not said anything bad about the Bundys.
[00:34:30.240 --> 00:34:33.282]  I think they are in good faith, as David Knight said yesterday.
[00:34:33.282 --> 00:34:35.184]  I concur with David Knight's analysis.
[00:34:35.184 --> 00:34:39.528]  He was there with the Feds threatening to shoot him last year.
[00:34:39.528 --> 00:34:44.273]  That footage, historic Feds surrender to Patriots, is online with millions of views.
[00:34:46.155 --> 00:34:59.578]  But when you go out to a place and most of the locals don't want you, the sheriff doesn't want you, and you've got the feds involved, and you've got the Hammonds.
[00:34:59.578 --> 00:35:04.360]  You know, I first, on Saturday, heard the Hammonds didn't want their help.
[00:35:04.360 --> 00:35:05.760]  And I thought, well, that's certainly not true.
[00:35:05.760 --> 00:35:06.540]  Let me go look at that.
[00:35:06.540 --> 00:35:09.861]  And then I went and saw the Hammonds on TV saying it.
[00:35:09.861 --> 00:35:13.742]  So all I'm saying is, tactically and politically,
[00:35:15.546 --> 00:35:20.087]  This does not look like the best situation to me.
[00:35:20.087 --> 00:35:41.450]  And then the paranoia sets in, or no one can come near the barn, you know, there are tactical positions and all this, and then hardly anybody talks to the press, and it just turns into what looks like a pretty bad situation to me, with the simultaneous rollout of Obama coming for the guns and saying they're for the patriots.
[00:35:41.450 --> 00:35:44.131]  Because the obvious thing is when you see terror attacks in this country,
[00:35:45.523 --> 00:35:50.047]  Like we saw in San Bernardino, folks want to go out and get armed, and that's happening, record gun sales.
[00:35:50.047 --> 00:36:02.539]  So, the timing of this stinks to high heaven, and I'm saying there are individuals, there are organizations, there are groups, there is media, you know, national media, you name it, in there stirring all this up.
[00:36:02.539 --> 00:36:08.645]  CNN, MSNBC are having orgasms right now, excuse my French, of delight.
[00:36:10.094 --> 00:36:12.876]  Over this, and Sunday we're all blaming me for it.
[00:36:12.876 --> 00:36:15.858]  Alex Jones followers are out there calling for a war.
[00:36:15.858 --> 00:36:18.059]  Hundreds of newspapers saying, I want violence.
[00:36:18.059 --> 00:36:20.601]  Okay, so I don't want violence.
[00:36:20.601 --> 00:36:22.222]  I want to continue waking people up.
[00:36:22.222 --> 00:36:26.345]  I want to see Congress shoot down these executive orders.
[00:36:26.345 --> 00:36:28.566]  I want to see lawsuits.
[00:36:28.566 --> 00:36:32.429]  I want to see the NRA double in size, Gunners of America double in size.
[00:36:32.429 --> 00:36:36.772]  I want to see governors like Abbott come and take it and stand up that way.
[00:36:37.392 --> 00:36:43.778]  With governors and state houses and legislatures and men in suits professionally doing it.
[00:36:43.778 --> 00:36:53.929]  When we can do it in a federally controlled area, which is obviously wide open, to be misrepresented, I wouldn't choose to have a political battle.
[00:36:53.929 --> 00:36:57.132]  I mean, it's like you're down in a swamp and they're up on a hill.
[00:36:57.132 --> 00:36:58.913]  That's not good ground.
[00:36:58.913 --> 00:37:00.955]  Guys on horseback with American flags,
[00:37:02.298 --> 00:37:12.264]  With men, women, and children riding up with the feds aiming guns at them and the people right across the line onto their own grazing rights to get their cattle that have been stolen.
[00:37:12.264 --> 00:37:13.365]  They had the moral right.
[00:37:13.365 --> 00:37:14.406]  They had the right.
[00:37:14.406 --> 00:37:21.270]  I mean, I happen to know through sources that a lot of the tactical team military people that were in BLM uniforms agreed with the Bundys.
[00:37:22.912 --> 00:37:26.615]  Well, now they've been able to bring in some teams that don't.
[00:37:26.615 --> 00:37:29.698]  And I'll just tell you that, we have a lot of sources.
[00:37:29.698 --> 00:37:37.084]  And they don't hate the Bundys, but they're trying to not get the orders to have a shooting war.
[00:37:37.084 --> 00:37:38.866]  And look, I admire the Bundys.
[00:37:40.367 --> 00:37:43.388]  But the media is calling him the Al Qaeda now.
[00:37:43.388 --> 00:37:47.330]  The media, the Soros groups are calling him white terrorists and doing banner hangs on highways.
[00:37:47.330 --> 00:37:49.811]  They want to have a race war, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:37:49.811 --> 00:37:51.731]  And that's why I traveled.
[00:37:51.731 --> 00:37:54.652]  This was set up a month ago.
[00:37:54.652 --> 00:37:58.034]  That's why I traveled here Sunday.
[00:37:58.034 --> 00:38:09.438]  And I'm leaving today to Phoenix, Arizona, was to interview Louis Farrakhan at Elijah Muhammad's original home and where Louis Farrakhan stays much of the time.
[00:38:10.831 --> 00:38:19.967]  And I came here to interview him on ways to not have extreme rhetoric on the government side, the local side, the police side, the...
[00:38:21.877 --> 00:38:25.398]  Black Muslim side, the Patriot side, whatever the case is.
[00:38:25.398 --> 00:38:27.938]  And it was a much better interview than I even thought.
[00:38:27.938 --> 00:38:29.719]  Two hours long.
[00:38:29.719 --> 00:38:31.319]  We're going to be putting it out in the next few weeks.
[00:38:31.319 --> 00:38:31.839]  They want to put it out.
[00:38:31.839 --> 00:38:35.400]  I was going to take a month to put it out and really kind of make a documentary, but they want to put it out quicker.
[00:38:35.400 --> 00:38:38.261]  So we're going to race as fast as we can to put this out.
[00:38:38.261 --> 00:38:40.621]  It's going to be a huge interview.
[00:38:40.621 --> 00:38:44.102]  Headlines are going to be all over the country about this.
[00:38:44.102 --> 00:38:48.283]  I can tell you that Louis Farrakhan said point blank at dinner last night
[00:38:49.622 --> 00:38:50.462]  Very, very gracious.
[00:38:50.462 --> 00:39:01.146]  I was at dinner with him for three hours with Rob Dew and Josh Owens, and then two hours, two hours and ten minutes interviewing him before that, that there is a grand jury that is open to indict him.
[00:39:01.146 --> 00:39:08.388]  He's told they're coming to arrest him very soon, and that he knows they're trying to cause a race war and a civil war in America.
[00:39:09.093 --> 00:39:14.355]  And the things he said have been taken out of context when he said that the police shoot us in the back, we go out and get them.
[00:39:14.355 --> 00:39:16.356]  He said he meant the people that do it specifically.
[00:39:16.356 --> 00:39:29.082]  But he said he understands that he said that in anger and that he agrees that all of God's children, all the tribes of Israel, need to come together against the New World Order and the private fellow reserve.
[00:39:29.082 --> 00:39:37.226]  And ladies and gentlemen, I'm not going to tell you what else he said because I'm going to coordinate with his people.
[00:39:39.591 --> 00:39:43.933]  Because he said some amazing things about Donald Trump, you name it.
[00:39:43.933 --> 00:39:45.794]  It's going to be a big interview.
[00:39:45.794 --> 00:39:49.877]  So I was literally a month ago setting up this interview.
[00:39:49.877 --> 00:39:51.317]  He invited me to his home in New York.
[00:39:51.317 --> 00:39:55.119]  I couldn't go at that time because of family engagements.
[00:39:55.119 --> 00:39:59.081]  So instead, we scheduled to interview him yesterday on the 4th.
[00:39:59.081 --> 00:40:06.225]  We interviewed Louis Farrakhan, who is extremely charming and charismatic, probably the most charismatic person.
[00:40:06.225 --> 00:40:07.046]  I've been around people.
[00:40:08.919 --> 00:40:14.381]  Like Russell Brand, who you see on TV, he's got some charisma, but in person, it's like, whoa.
[00:40:14.381 --> 00:40:16.522]  I mean, it's like electric.
[00:40:16.522 --> 00:40:22.824]  And you know, there's all these women fawning on him, and he's like, looks like 6'5", and just built like Schwarzenegger once you're around him in person.
[00:40:22.824 --> 00:40:25.885]  He doesn't look as skinny, and he just has this presence.
[00:40:25.885 --> 00:40:28.746]  Lance Armstrong has a big presence.
[00:40:28.746 --> 00:40:30.867]  Janet Reno has a really evil presence.
[00:40:30.867 --> 00:40:32.507]  I've been right up next to her.
[00:40:32.507 --> 00:40:33.688]  Clinton has an evil presence.
[00:40:33.688 --> 00:40:35.448]  Hillary Clinton has like a stinking presence.
[00:40:38.154 --> 00:40:41.635]  Matt Drudge is like a smart presence.
[00:40:41.635 --> 00:40:47.816]  Donald Trump has a very energetic presence.
[00:40:47.816 --> 00:41:01.118]  But, I mean, Louis Farrakhan, and I'm not doing a gushing thing here, it's just that I want to have, it's easy to get up here, go do an interview, attack Louis Farrakhan, put bad clips of him out of order, and then just demonize him.
[00:41:01.118 --> 00:41:03.298]  But I really do want to have peace.
[00:41:03.298 --> 00:41:06.539]  I really do want to get the Nation of Islam talking about how they've aborted
[00:41:07.812 --> 00:41:10.433]  51% of the blacks in this country since Roe v. Wade.
[00:41:10.433 --> 00:41:14.715]  And I said to him, there's 1,100 people shot by cops on average.
[00:41:14.715 --> 00:41:21.798]  They admit over 90% of that is in good faith, cops getting shot at, bank robbers, liquor store robberies, whatever.
[00:41:21.798 --> 00:41:29.722]  And I said to him, I said, you've got, you've got, what is it, 20 million blacks or so aborted since Roe v. Wade?
[00:41:29.722 --> 00:41:32.643]  Hundreds of thousands, millions every couple years.
[00:41:32.643 --> 00:41:35.925]  You got millions over here on this side of the way, on the scales.
[00:41:37.837 --> 00:41:40.019]  Half the black people killed.
[00:41:40.019 --> 00:41:47.326]  And then over here on this side, you've got 150 people that are questionable a year by the police.
[00:41:47.326 --> 00:41:58.818]  And, you know, let's say that are black out of the thousand or so that probably shouldn't have been shot.
[00:41:58.818 --> 00:41:59.879]  There's 1,100 or so police shootings.
[00:42:03.288 --> 00:42:06.711]  And there's only a couple hundred that you could say were questionable conservatively.
[00:42:06.711 --> 00:42:09.513]  So we're not even talking about, I mean, total, the numbers are insane.
[00:42:09.513 --> 00:42:10.453]  We've got to break this down.
[00:42:10.453 --> 00:42:14.496]  It's like end of the world, the police are coming to kill us.
[00:42:14.496 --> 00:42:17.399]  What's coming to take over is your smart car taxing you by the mile.
[00:42:17.399 --> 00:42:20.541]  What's coming to get you is the smart meter frying you in your house.
[00:42:20.541 --> 00:42:22.622]  What's coming to get you is fluoride in the water.
[00:42:22.622 --> 00:42:26.565]  What's coming to get you is cancer viruses in the vaccines.
[00:42:26.565 --> 00:42:29.788]  What's coming to get us is the soft kill New World Order.
[00:42:31.502 --> 00:42:37.024]  Louis Farrakhan said Islam is a failed religion and needs to be reformed.
[00:42:37.024 --> 00:42:39.866]  He said we need to block Muslims coming into the U.S.
[00:42:39.866 --> 00:42:41.386]  until we put controls on.
[00:42:41.386 --> 00:42:43.627]  In fact, I think the Farrakhan people are right.
[00:42:43.627 --> 00:42:47.589]  They said the interview was so powerful they want it out basically now.
[00:42:47.589 --> 00:42:52.831]  And I was like, well, I want to add a bunch of clips and make it really, you know what, I'm going to call him back today.
[00:42:52.831 --> 00:42:53.892]  In fact, do you come in here, please?
[00:42:56.499 --> 00:42:58.580]  I'll talk to you during the break about what time our flight is.
[00:42:58.580 --> 00:43:09.386]  I don't want to run back by there and talk to their video people, you know, that had us in their studio, because the more I think about it, the stuff he said, it's like Drudge came to us and just dumped his guts, you know, just all the data dump.
[00:43:09.386 --> 00:43:10.747]  It was awesome.
[00:43:10.747 --> 00:43:11.287]  And that's the thing.
[00:43:11.287 --> 00:43:15.229]  I want to be the place where people can come and spill their guts.
[00:43:15.229 --> 00:43:20.632]  I want to be the place where Matt Drudge comes and says, I met with a Supreme Court justice and they're coming for the First Amendment next year.
[00:43:21.479 --> 00:43:29.342]  They're coming for the second, and the Supreme Court signaled last Friday, or last Thursday, they signaled, oh, we're coming for the guns and free speech this year.
[00:43:29.342 --> 00:43:36.365]  I mean, folks, this is an epic time, and we don't want to be white, black, whatever, Hispanic, killing each other right now.
[00:43:37.583 --> 00:43:40.985]  After we defeat the New World Order, if we want to be idiots and kill each other, whatever, go ahead and do it.
[00:43:40.985 --> 00:43:41.665]  I don't want that to happen.
[00:43:41.665 --> 00:43:48.449]  But I really do not want it on my soul and my conscience that my government is targeting all the children for abortion.
[00:43:48.449 --> 00:43:51.171]  But they want to abort the whole human species.
[00:43:51.171 --> 00:43:53.032]  Now, David Knight's with us here.
[00:43:53.032 --> 00:43:53.993]  He's got a lot to cover.
[00:43:53.993 --> 00:44:00.617]  But I tell you, David, this situation in Oregon is going exactly like we said it would on Sunday.
[00:44:00.617 --> 00:44:02.097]  People go back to those Facebook mentions.
[00:44:03.238 --> 00:44:04.979]  And the YouTube I shot.
[00:44:04.979 --> 00:44:07.421]  And then the Sunday show that you hosted.
[00:44:07.421 --> 00:44:08.822]  And we're just stating the facts.
[00:44:08.822 --> 00:44:11.704]  Everybody knows we're 110% supporters of land rights.
[00:44:11.704 --> 00:44:13.865]  We're 110% supporters of the Second Amendment.
[00:44:13.865 --> 00:44:16.047]  We're 110% supporters of the First Amendment.
[00:44:16.047 --> 00:44:18.448]  We're 110% supporters of states' rights.
[00:44:18.448 --> 00:44:21.791]  We're 110% supporters of good governors like Greg Abbott.
[00:44:21.791 --> 00:44:23.352]  Thank God for him in this critical time.
[00:44:23.352 --> 00:44:27.434]  We've got him and not Rick Perry, who is a fake conservative, compared to him.
[00:44:27.434 --> 00:44:30.677]  And thank, obviously better than Obama, thank God
[00:44:31.488 --> 00:45:00.212]  That we've been in a position to warn people, but man, I gotta say, Joe Biggs told me, he's gonna come on next, middle of the third hour, multiple times, he's just out there to report, cover the press conference, see what's happening, and he had some of the prominent militia people, who I don't know their names, I don't know who all these people are, and I barely, you know, can remember all the Bundy's names, you know, there's like four or five of them, and they just march up and go, thanks a lot for saying the Bundy's are feds,
[00:45:01.618 --> 00:45:03.158]  And then Joe goes, where was that said?
[00:45:03.158 --> 00:45:04.039]  On Alex's show.
[00:45:04.039 --> 00:45:05.259]  Really, where was it said?
[00:45:05.259 --> 00:45:09.980]  Well, I guess you didn't say it, but... And then we know that that's what people do.
[00:45:09.980 --> 00:45:12.740]  They come up and say, Alex Jones says you're a fed.
[00:45:12.740 --> 00:45:14.501]  They go, well, how dare him?
[00:45:14.501 --> 00:45:20.742]  And then once they've already buddied up and said, Alex is saying we're feds, everybody gets to be on this high horse.
[00:45:20.742 --> 00:45:23.963]  See, the great Alex Jones, he's not as patriot as we are.
[00:45:24.383 --> 00:45:25.703]  You know, he says we're feds.
[00:45:25.703 --> 00:45:42.826]  I said watch your butt, because Harry Reid has said you're a domestic terrorist and wants to demonize all of us, and you speak for us now, and they're coming for our guns, and all the people that are in the comment sections on InfoWars, the minority of trolls that want a shooting war, you're the ones that always tell other people to go out and have a shooting war.
[00:45:42.826 --> 00:45:45.607]  You're the ones that are always out there pushing somebody else to do it.
[00:45:45.607 --> 00:45:47.787]  Let me tell you something, big man.
[00:45:47.787 --> 00:45:49.847]  You go ahead and go do it if you think it's so great.
[00:45:49.847 --> 00:45:51.108]  No, I say you shouldn't do it.
[00:45:51.108 --> 00:45:53.348]  Let me tell you, you want a shooting war, you're probably going to get one.
[00:45:53.948 --> 00:46:01.582]  And it's when the globalists that have taken over this country blow up some more federal buildings or shoot up a school and blame it on the patriot movement.
[00:46:02.563 --> 00:46:16.536]  Because let me tell you, just as day follows night in sitcoms and dramas and cartoons and newspapers and TV and radio, they've been demonizing the Patriots for seven years, saying we're getting ready to start killing everybody and taking over buildings and murdering everyone.
[00:46:16.536 --> 00:46:20.759]  And then when they start pulling it or tricking people into it, it's on, folks.
[00:46:20.759 --> 00:46:23.142]  We're winning politically right now.
[00:46:23.142 --> 00:46:25.183]  We are winning in this wrestling match.
[00:46:25.183 --> 00:46:28.867]  They don't want us to continue to win, and they've got their operatives out in force.
[00:46:29.247 --> 00:46:33.730]  Hammering right now, everywhere, pushing to try to start a civil war.
[00:46:33.730 --> 00:46:37.792]  But I'll tell you, we don't just have to count on the grassroots patriots out there to be smart.
[00:46:37.792 --> 00:46:39.373]  A lot of them are really smart.
[00:46:39.373 --> 00:46:40.173]  And God bless them.
[00:46:40.173 --> 00:46:42.515]  And they're angry, and I can admire the fact they're ready to fight.
[00:46:43.643 --> 00:46:45.364]  But let me tell you, the art of war.
[00:46:45.364 --> 00:46:47.004]  Fight on your terms when you want to.
[00:46:47.004 --> 00:46:49.205]  90% of war is info war.
[00:46:49.205 --> 00:46:51.266]  I'm going to tell you something right now.
[00:46:51.266 --> 00:47:04.591]  There are people in the FBI, in all these agencies that know that their bosses want to start a civil war and want to create a huge crisis where they can get draconian laws passed and smokescreen all these executive orders to take our guns.
[00:47:04.591 --> 00:47:10.033]  And I can tell you that Saturday, I met with a prominent individual.
[00:47:12.233 --> 00:47:24.436]  And I've met with other prominent individuals, and I'm going to leave it at that, and I have confirmed in triplicate that the reason the Secret Service is being persecuted, of course in an agency that big there's going to be a drunk driving incident or a hooker or something big.
[00:47:24.436 --> 00:47:27.497]  I'm not saying that's okay, but that's out there for a reason.
[00:47:27.497 --> 00:47:31.798]  Because they hate that agency because it gets to see what the President's doing.
[00:47:31.798 --> 00:47:33.078]  And by the way, those people are smart.
[00:47:33.078 --> 00:47:37.079]  They don't tell me what they're seeing because I'd get killed if I knew.
[00:47:37.079 --> 00:47:40.820]  But they say, like Bongino said, the former head of his Foreign Detail said here, and I want him back on,
[00:47:41.989 --> 00:47:44.533]  It's worse than you're saying, Alex.
[00:47:44.533 --> 00:47:49.560]  Well, finally, through two sources.
[00:47:49.560 --> 00:47:54.406]  Ladies and gentlemen, they say that Obama is not just a radical Muslim sympathizer.
[00:47:55.455 --> 00:48:02.117]  But he, whether it's a psyop to leak back to Saudi Arabia or Israel or whatever, Obama is hitting his knees.
[00:48:02.117 --> 00:48:05.158]  He wears a radical Wahhabist ring.
[00:48:05.158 --> 00:48:08.219]  Obama actually prays to Mecca five times a day, folks.
[00:48:08.219 --> 00:48:11.460]  He grew up, he went to madrasas in Indonesia.
[00:48:11.460 --> 00:48:12.841]  He is a Muslim.
[00:48:12.841 --> 00:48:14.982]  He is a Sunni Muslim, folks.
[00:48:14.982 --> 00:48:16.902]  That's why he bowed to the king of Saudi Arabia.
[00:48:19.795 --> 00:48:21.737]  I mean, folks, we are screwed.
[00:48:21.737 --> 00:48:26.761]  If I was ever going to evacuate and get my family out of here, I'd pledge to stay here.
[00:48:26.761 --> 00:48:34.809]  But I mean, when you're facing a radical jihad president, when you're facing them coming for the guns, God Almighty!
[00:48:34.809 --> 00:48:40.414]  I mean, they're trying to start war with Russia, they're attacking Russia with radical Muslims.
[00:48:40.414 --> 00:48:44.238]  I can't even believe, David Knight, I cannot even believe.
[00:48:45.686 --> 00:48:51.390]  And the Feds are saying to me and others, look, just don't let them start a civil war.
[00:48:51.390 --> 00:48:53.011]  We don't want this.
[00:48:53.011 --> 00:48:55.172]  We're not going to follow orders to come take the guns.
[00:48:55.172 --> 00:48:56.873]  They're going to do it in a few cities.
[00:48:56.873 --> 00:48:58.214]  We don't want a civil war.
[00:48:58.214 --> 00:48:59.115]  We know it's true.
[00:48:59.115 --> 00:49:02.237]  The patriots are winning, folks.
[00:49:02.237 --> 00:49:06.859]  The generals are going public, saying the government runs Al Qaeda.
[00:49:06.859 --> 00:49:08.801]  So I'm telling you, they're in trouble, folks.
[00:49:08.801 --> 00:49:12.263]  We're that close to beating them politically.
[00:49:12.263 --> 00:49:13.564]  They want to destroy this country.
[00:49:14.477 --> 00:49:26.115]  And of course they got bad feds in there that hate patriots, like Lon Horyuchi and others that's retired, but most of them aren't stupid, and they see the writing on the wall, and if we get past this narrative of just having an idiotic shooting war...
[00:49:27.392 --> 00:49:29.193]  We can save this country peacefully.
[00:49:29.193 --> 00:49:31.033]  Now, the globalists are going to do false flags.
[00:49:31.033 --> 00:49:33.534]  My God, we got a Wahhabist in the White House.
[00:49:33.534 --> 00:49:35.535]  And you know I used to hear that and say it wasn't true.
[00:49:35.535 --> 00:49:36.995]  It's true.
[00:49:36.995 --> 00:49:38.396]  It's true.
[00:49:38.396 --> 00:49:42.057]  We are screwed, folks, unless we hit our knees before God.
[00:49:42.057 --> 00:49:43.097]  David, I'm going to skip this break.
[00:49:43.097 --> 00:49:44.618]  This is so important, and I have no more today.
[00:49:44.618 --> 00:49:55.822]  But, I mean, I literally got physically nauseous Saturday when I confirmed through another high-level source, in person,
[00:49:56.997 --> 00:49:59.420]  In person.
[00:49:59.420 --> 00:50:08.290]  And I'm not going to give out any details what agency, let's just say Armourers, with a major federal agency.
[00:50:08.290 --> 00:50:09.211]  Okay?
[00:50:09.211 --> 00:50:10.553]  I mean, it is on, David.
[00:50:10.553 --> 00:50:11.714]  They are scared.
[00:50:11.714 --> 00:50:16.479]  Well, you know, Alex, I remember when Obama began to run back in 2000, for the 2008 election.
[00:50:18.240 --> 00:50:23.404]  The New York Times reported that he began one of the rallies with a perfect Muslim call to prayer.
[00:50:23.404 --> 00:50:27.287]  Nobody recorded that, supposedly, and we never heard any more about that.
[00:50:27.287 --> 00:50:29.829]  They took that off of the narrative.
[00:50:29.829 --> 00:50:32.031]  But that's been there from the very beginning.
[00:50:32.031 --> 00:50:45.061]  Of course, there were a lot of questions as to, after he spent most of his life growing up in Indonesia, and the connections there to that brutal government that was being run by the CIA, his wife, his mother.
[00:50:45.581 --> 00:50:52.526]  Being connected to a family that was part of the CIA in the early years, the foundational years.
[00:50:52.526 --> 00:50:57.009]  And then he disappears and he goes to Pakistan, he comes back and his name is changed and there's no records about that.
[00:50:57.009 --> 00:51:02.793]  We have absolutely no background checks on this president who is demanding background checks on everybody.
[00:51:02.793 --> 00:51:07.316]  And Alex Williams... That's right, there is a billion, two hundred million Muslims, a billion
[00:51:09.299 --> 00:51:11.321]  80 million plus are Sunni.
[00:51:11.321 --> 00:51:13.663]  About a third of those are radicals on record.
[00:51:13.663 --> 00:51:17.465]  And of course, the globalists just went to the biggest population group, set them all up.
[00:51:17.465 --> 00:51:20.628]  They probably had it planned for 50 years with Saudi Arabian oil and all of it.
[00:51:20.628 --> 00:51:21.649]  We've been double-crossed.
[00:51:21.649 --> 00:51:22.629]  Our shields are down.
[00:51:22.629 --> 00:51:23.370]  We're screwed.
[00:51:23.370 --> 00:51:30.235]  I mean, if America doesn't understand how... David, David, I've never been this shaken.
[00:51:30.235 --> 00:51:32.037]  I've never... It's all coming together.
[00:51:32.037 --> 00:51:34.959]  We have been... This is the end of America.
[00:51:35.612 --> 00:51:36.353]  Yes, yes.
[00:51:36.353 --> 00:51:38.795]  If he gets to the open borders... I mean, this is it, folks!
[00:51:38.795 --> 00:51:41.898]  I hope all you feds that have gone along with this are proud of yourselves.
[00:51:41.898 --> 00:51:45.402]  And I hope all the people out there that have been lazy are proud of yourselves.
[00:51:45.402 --> 00:51:48.304]  Because, look, you just tried to say it, the borders are wide open.
[00:51:48.304 --> 00:51:50.827]  They ordered the Border Patrol to ship the illegals in.
[00:51:50.827 --> 00:51:52.228]  I mean, folks, it's a joke!
[00:51:52.228 --> 00:51:53.489]  It's all totally illegal!
[00:51:53.489 --> 00:51:54.751]  Sorry, David, go ahead, make your point.
[00:51:55.231 --> 00:51:58.934]  No, actually Alex, there's a couple of articles up on InfoWars today.
[00:51:58.934 --> 00:52:05.379]  One of them about the German police covering up massive assaults on New Year's Eve in Cologne near the train station.
[00:52:05.379 --> 00:52:09.802]  They had about 500 young Arab and North American men flooded the square there.
[00:52:09.802 --> 00:52:14.286]  They attacked at least 35 women, were subjected to sexual assault, one report of rape.
[00:52:14.286 --> 00:52:15.887]  They expect that number to go up.
[00:52:15.887 --> 00:52:20.510]  There's another report on InfoWars.com about Norway and Oslo.
[00:52:21.551 --> 00:52:24.272]  The Capitol, the police are saying, we have lost the city.
[00:52:24.272 --> 00:52:25.332]  That's a quote.
[00:52:25.332 --> 00:52:26.712]  We have lost the city.
[00:52:26.712 --> 00:52:27.872]  We have lost the city.
[00:52:27.872 --> 00:52:28.553]  Mayday.
[00:52:28.553 --> 00:52:28.993]  Mayday.
[00:52:28.993 --> 00:52:29.453]  It's true.
[00:52:29.453 --> 00:52:30.173]  We're under attack.
[00:52:30.173 --> 00:52:31.273]  We've been double-crossed.
[00:52:31.273 --> 00:52:33.074]  It's exactly what all the right-wingers said.
[00:52:33.074 --> 00:52:33.974]  I didn't believe them.
[00:52:33.974 --> 00:52:35.754]  This is insane, folks.
[00:52:35.754 --> 00:52:37.454]  This is insane.
[00:52:37.454 --> 00:52:38.615]  And it's worse than that.
[00:52:38.615 --> 00:52:43.336]  They're now storming churches and ransacking and literally raping people in the pews.
[00:52:43.336 --> 00:52:47.177]  Mainstream news and the politically correct are taking it as a sacrament.
[00:52:47.177 --> 00:52:48.197]  They love it.
[00:52:48.197 --> 00:52:49.137]  What filth!
[00:52:49.518 --> 00:52:52.212]  What do all these liberals think they're going to do when they're under Sharia law?
[00:52:53.066 --> 00:53:04.311]  Well you know Alex, what they're saying is that Grunland, which is this ghetto area that's in Oslo, just two train stops from the parliament, they're saying that area is more Muslim than Morocco.
[00:53:04.311 --> 00:53:06.291]  And of course that's in Norway.
[00:53:06.291 --> 00:53:07.092]  That's it.
[00:53:07.092 --> 00:53:09.273]  There's nothing left of that area of Europe.
[00:53:09.273 --> 00:53:14.895]  They come in, they create ghettos because they don't want to mix with the Europeans that are there.
[00:53:14.895 --> 00:53:18.136]  They don't want to learn their language, they don't want to interact with them, they want to be separate.
[00:53:18.136 --> 00:53:22.478]  Louis Farrakhan, to my face, said Islam has failed and needs to be reformed.
[00:53:23.066 --> 00:53:24.527]  Well, I agree with him.
[00:53:24.527 --> 00:53:25.728]  I certainly agree with him.
[00:53:25.728 --> 00:53:27.489]  Well, this interview is so over-the-top.
[00:53:27.489 --> 00:53:31.991]  Part of the problem is that when these migrants come in, they are self-ghettoizing.
[00:53:31.991 --> 00:53:41.577]  They create their own ghetto, not just because there's a cultural and a language difference that we would see as other immigrant groups would come in from Europe in the early 20th century.
[00:53:41.577 --> 00:53:42.517]  They want that.
[00:53:42.517 --> 00:53:43.678]  They don't want to change that.
[00:53:43.678 --> 00:53:45.019]  They want to be separate.
[00:53:45.019 --> 00:53:47.120]  They just want to take control.
[00:53:47.120 --> 00:53:51.923]  And that is a recipe for disaster, because the kids... Absolutely, and I want to expand on this.
[00:53:52.423 --> 00:53:54.504]  I want to expand on this.
[00:53:54.504 --> 00:53:59.165]  My biggest concern is they're going to provocateur patriots into violence, pushing stuff.
[00:53:59.165 --> 00:54:09.307]  The feds, the citizens, everybody needs to decide they're Americans right now and cooler heads prevail and realize the bigger picture of the globalist takeover, the financial collapse that's already beginning, all of it.
[00:54:09.307 --> 00:54:10.267]  We got to come together.
[00:54:10.267 --> 00:54:11.287]  Come on, folks.
[00:54:11.287 --> 00:54:12.528]  Choose the right side.
[00:54:12.528 --> 00:54:16.749]  Don't just hate each other over race or if somebody's a patriot or a fed or whatever.
[00:54:16.749 --> 00:54:19.769]  Let's really think about what side we're on here and just come together.
[00:54:19.769 --> 00:54:21.690]  And I'm really worried that people are going to get fed up.
[00:54:22.350 --> 00:54:24.432]  And attack mosques or attack Muslims.
[00:54:24.432 --> 00:54:32.582]  Most Muslims that have actually come here in the past, because I know them, were fleeing tyranny, Iraqis and others, that wanted their daughters to go to college and are good people.
[00:54:32.582 --> 00:54:35.925]  They're bringing in the radicals now to police those Muslims.
[00:54:35.925 --> 00:54:42.733]  Our government's allied with the bad Muslims, with the Saudis, with the people that chopped off 47 heads this weekend.
[00:54:43.974 --> 00:54:46.657]  Do not attack Muslims, folks.
[00:54:46.657 --> 00:54:48.799]  That will only allow this to intensify.
[00:54:48.799 --> 00:54:53.543]  We have got to point out that the borders are wide open and that this is treason.
[00:54:53.543 --> 00:54:56.646]  Politically, Obama is a lame duck and hated.
[00:54:56.646 --> 00:54:59.709]  We need to make Congress and the governors begin reversing this.
[00:54:59.709 --> 00:55:06.156]  We need emergency legislative sessions in the state of Texas and others to block the refugees, to block the gun control.
[00:55:06.736 --> 00:55:09.518]  That will be the bully pulpit, the states coming together.
[00:55:09.518 --> 00:55:15.742]  We need governors to say, and don't you do any provocateur stuff, globalists, because the globalists are known.
[00:55:15.742 --> 00:55:22.266]  And we're weaponizing the patriots in the info war, the governors and others know the truth now, and many congressmen and women.
[00:55:22.266 --> 00:55:27.209]  And they're all ready, like Donald Trump's doing, they're ready to call Bill Clinton a rapist.
[00:55:27.209 --> 00:55:30.951]  They're ready to hammer them with false flag terror that they've staged.
[00:55:30.951 --> 00:55:34.434]  Let me tell you, the gloves are ready to come off with the real patriots in America,
[00:55:35.074 --> 00:55:39.177]  Look, even as fast as the awakening's happening, it's not hardcore enough.
[00:55:39.177 --> 00:55:41.098]  They're coming for the guns.
[00:55:41.098 --> 00:55:43.879]  We told you, and frankly, it's worse.
[00:55:43.879 --> 00:55:46.121]  I thought this would be in round two, Salvo.
[00:55:46.121 --> 00:55:48.082]  He said he's going to keep having them for months.
[00:55:48.082 --> 00:55:55.386]  I thought the national registration and the psychological stuff and taking them from Social Security recipients, that would come in phase two.
[00:55:55.386 --> 00:55:57.007]  It's come in phase one.
[00:55:57.007 --> 00:56:01.030]  He's up there crying because he hates us so much in fake garbage.
[00:56:01.030 --> 00:56:01.710]  I mean, it's on.
[00:56:01.710 --> 00:56:02.651]  Now, let me stop right here.
[00:56:03.527 --> 00:56:13.293]  Folks, if you don't send links out to InfoWars.com forward slash show to your Facebook, your Twitter, your family, everybody you know, newspapers, talk show hosts, everybody, you're insane.
[00:56:13.293 --> 00:56:14.774]  We are the tip of the spear.
[00:56:14.774 --> 00:56:15.795]  We love you.
[00:56:15.795 --> 00:56:17.296]  We are committed to the fight.
[00:56:17.296 --> 00:56:18.577]  We love freedom.
[00:56:18.577 --> 00:56:20.458]  People are listening exponentially.
[00:56:20.458 --> 00:56:22.760]  We got to grow even faster in the face of the enemy.
[00:56:22.760 --> 00:56:28.724]  And we have 15% off until Friday, and then it's going to end on everything with gift one five promo code.
[00:56:28.724 --> 00:56:30.525]  That's on stuff that already has discounts.
[00:56:30.525 --> 00:56:31.746]  If you don't get the New Year's
[00:56:32.586 --> 00:56:41.092]  Specials we've got on Detoxification, X2, Deep Cleanse, and Secret 12 Methylcobalamin.
[00:56:41.092 --> 00:56:42.352]  15% off and other discounts.
[00:56:42.352 --> 00:56:47.336]  If you don't get the Oxy Powder, if you don't get the Hillary for Prison shirts that we're not ordering more of,
[00:56:47.796 --> 00:56:48.076]  I think so.
[00:57:06.329 --> 00:57:07.490]  I need to reach more people.
[00:57:07.490 --> 00:57:13.275]  We need to have the funding to face the internal garbage and the attacks and the operatives.
[00:57:13.275 --> 00:57:14.516]  You have no idea.
[00:57:14.516 --> 00:57:15.496]  And look, we're not crying.
[00:57:15.496 --> 00:57:16.117]  We expect it.
[00:57:16.117 --> 00:57:17.558]  I mean, we're in the fight to win.
[00:57:17.558 --> 00:57:18.659]  We understand what we're up against.
[00:57:18.659 --> 00:57:20.900]  I mean, I thought I did, but my God.
[00:57:21.781 --> 00:57:25.842]  Actually, a Sunni Wahhabist in the White House praying to Mecca.
[00:57:25.842 --> 00:57:33.444]  I mean, this is... And he does it in front of the Secret Service, and he treats them like crap, and calls them idiots, and it's kids call... I mean, they said they've never seen anything like it.
[00:57:33.444 --> 00:57:36.545]  This is the disdain and hate for America, folks.
[00:57:36.545 --> 00:57:37.666]  The disrespect.
[00:57:37.666 --> 00:57:39.666]  They want to mount our head on the wall, folks.
[00:57:39.666 --> 00:57:40.926]  This is a takeover.
[00:57:40.926 --> 00:57:41.287]  And you know what?
[00:57:41.287 --> 00:57:42.267]  They deserve to take us over.
[00:57:42.267 --> 00:57:43.027]  We've been weak.
[00:57:43.027 --> 00:57:43.747]  We've been pathetic.
[00:57:43.747 --> 00:57:45.208]  But not anymore.
[00:57:45.208 --> 00:57:48.249]  We have been lulled into sleep by the NFL and Caitlyn Jenner.
[00:57:48.249 --> 00:57:49.609]  I mean, look at the psychological
[00:57:50.834 --> 00:57:51.934]  Poison they put us under.
[00:57:51.934 --> 00:58:00.477]  And in closing, we have InfoWarsHealth.com and InfoWarsTeam.com and the phone numbers on that site where you can call and they can walk you through.

[00:58:44.001 --> 00:58:45.943]  It's just the internet's not that good.
[00:58:45.943 --> 00:58:46.863]  We need the funding.

[01:00:44.111 --> 01:00:51.536]  Ladies and gentlemen, Wayne Madsen is going to be joining us about the organized persecution of Christians worldwide by George Soros.
[01:00:51.536 --> 01:00:58.081]  We're going to tie it into the big gun grab push, the open borders, the lawlessness.
[01:00:58.081 --> 01:01:12.251]  And now the Bundys, with the sheriff, most of the locals, and the Hammonds against them, are there in a federal barn, a little federal shed,
[01:01:14.546 --> 01:01:20.911]  And asking armed people to come there to stand up against the federal land grab.
[01:01:20.911 --> 01:01:22.792]  I'm not against the Mundies, as everybody knows.
[01:01:22.792 --> 01:01:32.059]  I'm allowed to have my view that I don't think this is the best time to be doing this.
[01:01:32.059 --> 01:01:33.460]  And I admire the courage, but...
[01:01:35.316 --> 01:01:40.284]  David Nye, I tell you, the biggest assault on the Second Amendment since they came for the guns at Lexington and Concord.
[01:01:40.284 --> 01:01:46.294]  And right the day this all kicks off, they get to have it all over the newspapers that armed patriots, you know, take over a building.
[01:01:46.294 --> 01:01:48.258]  I mean, just, my God!
[01:01:49.059 --> 01:02:03.823]  Yeah, Alex, I think what we've been saying, and we were saying it Sunday, but even before that, Alex, we had a hothead blogger who was there at the site attacking Stuart Rhodes because he was saying, look, the people there don't want your protection.
[01:02:03.823 --> 01:02:07.344]  You can't, as he's telling other Oath Keepers, he said, go there and protest.
[01:02:07.344 --> 01:02:08.025]  That's fine.
[01:02:08.025 --> 01:02:09.005]  That's a legitimate thing to do.
[01:02:09.685 --> 01:02:12.968]  But in terms of a protection operation, they haven't asked for your protection.
[01:02:12.968 --> 01:02:25.541]  They did a cordon around the gold mine out in Oregon, trying to make sure that the BLM was not going to go in and raze that place to the ground before they had due process.
[01:02:25.541 --> 01:02:27.804]  That's what the BLM was threatening to do.
[01:02:27.804 --> 01:02:29.265]  And you supported that months ago.
[01:02:29.265 --> 01:02:29.606]  Exactly.
[01:02:29.606 --> 01:02:30.186]  You supported that.
[01:02:30.186 --> 01:02:30.867]  We did too.
[01:02:31.187 --> 01:02:44.231]  And I looked at what was happening with this, and from the time they came back and lost their appeal, and it looked like they were going to be going to prison, they kept pushing back through their lawyer saying, we don't want anybody to stand in the gap here, we're just going to go to prison.
[01:02:44.231 --> 01:02:55.255]  So, this was the wrong place, it was the wrong time, not only the fact that it's in the dead of winter, but with what Obama was pulling with gun control, and it was the wrong community to do this in.
[01:02:55.255 --> 01:02:57.996]  Most of these people have a reservation mentality there in Oregon.
[01:02:58.516 --> 01:02:59.417]  We're going to interview the Hammonds.
[01:02:59.417 --> 01:03:01.558]  We're going to interview one of the Bundys today.
[01:03:01.558 --> 01:03:02.318]  Yeah.
[01:03:02.318 --> 01:03:03.719]  It's a just cause.
[01:03:03.719 --> 01:03:06.481]  It's a just cause, but they're just doing it the wrong way, I believe.
[01:03:06.481 --> 01:03:08.622]  And that's what we've said from the beginning.
[01:03:08.622 --> 01:03:13.786]  That's what Stuart Rhodes was saying even before we started talking about it, even before the takeover of that facility.
[01:03:14.733 --> 01:03:16.274]  I'm probably related to these people.
[01:03:16.274 --> 01:03:18.655]  Hammond is just a Hammond with a D taken off.
[01:03:18.655 --> 01:03:21.137]  An anglophile German name.
[01:03:21.137 --> 01:03:22.758]  So I'm probably related to these people.
[01:03:22.758 --> 01:03:26.480]  But I tell you, the whole thing is just completely out of control.
[01:03:26.480 --> 01:03:28.441]  And it just looks so scripted.
[01:03:28.441 --> 01:03:30.922]  I'm not saying the Bundys are scripting it.
[01:03:30.922 --> 01:03:31.543]  I'm saying
[01:03:32.463 --> 01:03:35.587]  You gotta know when to hold them, know when to fold them, know when to walk away, know when to run.
[01:03:35.587 --> 01:03:36.609]  You marched with them.
[01:03:36.609 --> 01:03:40.975]  You were one of the first to go across the line and reported the feds threatening to shoot you, David.
[01:03:40.975 --> 01:03:41.736]  You were unarmed.
[01:03:41.736 --> 01:03:42.216]  You did that.
[01:03:42.216 --> 01:03:43.939]  You have incredible courage.
[01:03:43.939 --> 01:03:45.220]  And then, you know, we've been there.
[01:03:45.220 --> 01:03:46.282]  We're in the movement.
[01:03:46.282 --> 01:03:47.624]  We helped build the Liberty Movement.
[01:03:48.064 --> 01:03:49.845]  Well, here's the difference, Alex.
[01:03:49.845 --> 01:03:55.528]  In that situation, you had the entire community was upset about the fact that they were attacking people.
[01:03:55.528 --> 01:03:57.209]  They had run all these ranchers out of business.
[01:03:57.209 --> 01:03:59.150]  They had set up a First Amendment area.
[01:03:59.150 --> 01:04:01.792]  Everything about that was just oppression.
[01:04:01.792 --> 01:04:05.974]  And so the entire community came together, along with people from the outside, to protect them.
[01:04:05.974 --> 01:04:11.077]  They had a very well-defined goal that could be achieved, could de-escalate that situation.
[01:04:11.537 --> 01:04:16.043]  They played that exactly right, but the important thing was the entire community was there together.
[01:04:16.043 --> 01:04:19.186]  Here in Oregon, over half of the people work for the federal government.
[01:04:19.186 --> 01:04:21.009]  Over half of the land is owned by the federal government.
[01:04:21.009 --> 01:04:22.891]  They have a reservation mentality.
[01:04:22.891 --> 01:04:29.279]  Even the people who are being so severely abused, these Hammonds, who are going to voluntarily go back to jail.
[01:04:29.839 --> 01:04:31.960]  They have a slave mentality.
[01:04:31.960 --> 01:04:33.560]  They have a slave mentality.
[01:04:33.560 --> 01:04:37.682]  When you live out there around nothing but the feds controlling everything, it is wrong.
[01:04:37.682 --> 01:04:40.622]  And I admire the western spirit of the Bundys.
[01:04:40.622 --> 01:04:44.904]  But I'm allowed to sit here and say, I think provocateurs are going to try to stir this up.
[01:04:44.904 --> 01:04:46.044]  The media is going with this.
[01:04:46.044 --> 01:04:49.625]  They're trying to demonize, quote, white terrorists and y'all kinda.
[01:04:49.625 --> 01:04:53.707]  This goes right into the whole globalist narrative and that's a fact and no one can deny it.
[01:04:53.707 --> 01:04:56.447]  So we're just pointing out the full spectrum of this.
[01:04:56.447 --> 01:04:57.508]  This is what we do.
[01:04:57.508 --> 01:04:57.908]  Stay there.
[01:04:58.228 --> 01:04:59.389]  You're riding a shotgun, David.
[01:04:59.389 --> 01:05:11.837]  While President Obama attempts to enact gun control via executive action, a new Gallup poll shows that only 2% of Americans believe that guns or gun control are among the country's top problems.
[01:05:11.837 --> 01:05:18.922]  Gallup asked about 1,000 Americans in all 50 states what they thought the nation's top problems were in 2015.
[01:05:18.922 --> 01:05:25.526]  And out of 23 problems mentioned by Americans, guns, gun control, ranked near the bottom at 19th.
[01:05:25.526 --> 01:05:26.287]  In comparison,
[01:05:26.687 --> 01:05:31.030]  Sixteen percent of Americans said that the government was the nation's biggest issue.
[01:05:31.030 --> 01:05:33.231]  Thirteen percent said the economy.
[01:05:33.231 --> 01:05:37.154]  Eight percent said unemployment, and another eight said immigration.
[01:05:37.154 --> 01:05:52.564]  But rather than working on these hot-button issues, both President Obama and the mainstream media would rather focus on gun control, with the president even stating that he wants to, quote, make gun control part of his legacy, end quote, according to CNN.

[01:06:58.760 --> 01:07:00.922]  It has happened.
[01:07:00.922 --> 01:07:02.783]  2015 has passed into history.
[01:07:02.783 --> 01:07:03.984]  Into lore.
[01:07:03.984 --> 01:07:07.327]  But now, 2016 has been born.

[01:07:13.375 --> 01:07:17.977]  That's a little too epic, that Hollywood action-adventure-science-fiction voice I'm using.
[01:07:17.977 --> 01:07:26.560]  But quite frankly, that's how I feel like I should be talking about what happens when your body actually gets the real, natural nutrients it needs.

[01:07:53.016 --> 01:07:54.638]  I can't help but get excited.

[01:07:55.479 --> 01:07:56.499]  Fight the globalists!

[01:07:57.340 --> 01:08:01.064]  Yeah!
[01:08:01.064 --> 01:08:03.826]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:08:03.826 --> 01:08:06.609]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:17.347 --> 01:08:30.696]  Ladies and gentlemen, there was a major Gallup poll a few days ago, showing that only 2% of Americans, we'll put that on screen for TV viewers, think that gun control is the number one issue in America.
[01:08:30.696 --> 01:08:34.999]  The vast majority of Americans are against turning in their guns or restricting guns.
[01:08:34.999 --> 01:08:39.942]  Gallup, only 2% say guns, gun control, among nation's most important problems.
[01:08:40.879 --> 01:08:42.740]  Well, that's about right.
[01:08:42.740 --> 01:08:47.681]  Guns are, if you look at the World Almanac, I used to every year buy it at the grocery store when I was shopping.
[01:08:47.681 --> 01:08:50.823]  They'd have it at the corner and I'd show people the statistics.
[01:08:50.823 --> 01:08:53.043]  Automobiles, this is 100,000 something.
[01:08:53.043 --> 01:08:53.624]  Cancer, 300,000.
[01:08:53.624 --> 01:08:55.964]  Heart attacks, hundreds of thousands.
[01:08:55.964 --> 01:08:57.885]  You know, falling in the bathroom, 15,000, 20,000, it varied.
[01:08:57.885 --> 01:08:59.005]  Drowning in the pool, 20-something thousand.
[01:09:03.627 --> 01:09:05.148]  Electrocution, 8,000.
[01:09:05.148 --> 01:09:06.168]  I'm going from memory here.
[01:09:06.168 --> 01:09:07.228]  Anybody can look it up.
[01:09:07.228 --> 01:09:08.969]  My memory's pretty good, though, but look it up.
[01:09:08.969 --> 01:09:11.270]  You know, great white sharks, five.
[01:09:11.270 --> 01:09:15.112]  Mako, six.
[01:09:15.112 --> 01:09:19.253]  Airplane crashes, you know, in the U.S.
[01:09:19.253 --> 01:09:20.994]  150, 500, it varies.
[01:09:20.994 --> 01:09:23.055]  Deer jumping in front of cars, 200 and something.
[01:09:23.055 --> 01:09:24.195]  Honeybees, 300 and something.
[01:09:24.195 --> 01:09:25.976]  I mean, it varies.
[01:09:25.976 --> 01:09:30.117]  Guns are 12,000 and change.
[01:09:30.117 --> 01:09:30.898]  Police kill 1,100 of that.
[01:09:33.544 --> 01:09:38.726]  Maybe a couple hundred are unjustified shootings.
[01:09:38.726 --> 01:09:40.526]  Out of 2 million cops.
[01:09:40.526 --> 01:09:42.027]  I'm not defending the police.
[01:09:42.027 --> 01:09:43.847]  They do unconstitutional stuff.
[01:09:43.847 --> 01:09:46.868]  They're taking orders from a corrupt, taken over government in many cases.
[01:09:46.868 --> 01:09:48.629]  I'm the guy that made police tape films.
[01:09:48.629 --> 01:09:49.889]  I'm the guy that wrote books on it.
[01:09:49.889 --> 01:09:51.750]  I'm the guy that exposed the biometrics coming.
[01:09:51.750 --> 01:09:54.070]  The smart cars 20 years ago.
[01:09:54.070 --> 01:09:55.811]  Everything!
[01:09:55.811 --> 01:10:01.873]  But then George Soros comes along and literally funds a leftist attempt to overthrow local governments.
[01:10:01.873 --> 01:10:02.473]  I'm against it.
[01:10:04.485 --> 01:10:09.708]  And I found no one more awake than the military.
[01:10:09.708 --> 01:10:13.769]  Special Ops, it's like 98%.
[01:10:13.769 --> 01:10:17.531]  It's unbelievable how awake they are.
[01:10:17.531 --> 01:10:22.554]  It's incredible how patriotic they are.
[01:10:22.554 --> 01:10:22.794]  Army.
[01:10:24.811 --> 01:10:26.612]  90% awake, General Army.
[01:10:26.612 --> 01:10:28.133]  Marines, about the same.
[01:10:28.133 --> 01:10:33.777]  I'm not bashing the Navy, they're great people, but Navy folks will tell you, there's something about going along with the system.
[01:10:33.777 --> 01:10:35.738]  I may be 60% awake, I've talked to the Navy.
[01:10:35.738 --> 01:10:39.500]  I know the Marines are assigned to that, but they're more awake.
[01:10:39.500 --> 01:10:41.282]  I'm not bashing the Navy, it's just something I've noticed.
[01:10:41.282 --> 01:10:48.607]  And you notice it's the Army that just continues to resist all this, the Generals, the leaks, the info.
[01:10:48.607 --> 01:10:51.809]  And that's because the Army actually does all the really nasty stuff.
[01:10:51.809 --> 01:10:53.230]  The Army's the big muscle.
[01:10:58.100 --> 01:11:03.103]  The Army's like the 100-foot tall troll and the Navy SEALs and the rest of them are like a 20-foot troll.
[01:11:03.103 --> 01:11:04.724]  The big mean troll hides back in the dark.
[01:11:04.724 --> 01:11:07.646]  The big mean troll's going on all the bad missions, doing all the nasty stuff.
[01:11:07.646 --> 01:11:13.510]  The big mean troll doesn't like what's going on.
[01:11:13.510 --> 01:11:15.431]  And so they want to start a civil war in this country.
[01:11:16.769 --> 01:11:18.650]  Military's the most awake.
[01:11:18.650 --> 01:11:20.550]  Local police are the next most awake.
[01:11:20.550 --> 01:11:27.652]  And I'm the guy that used to literally go around screaming in police's face and bullhorning them everywhere because they were following unconstitutional orders.
[01:11:27.652 --> 01:11:28.372]  I was upset.
[01:11:28.372 --> 01:11:30.133]  I thought I could make them wake up.
[01:11:30.133 --> 01:11:33.193]  And they'd say, hey, go change the laws.
[01:11:33.193 --> 01:11:34.914]  We're trying to follow the Constitution.
[01:11:38.086 --> 01:11:41.228]  And it is true, we should change the laws about the TSA.
[01:11:41.228 --> 01:11:44.810]  We should change the laws about federalization of police and asset forfeiture seizure.
[01:11:44.810 --> 01:11:46.210]  We should change the laws.
[01:11:46.210 --> 01:11:49.032]  We need to get up off our butts.
[01:11:49.032 --> 01:11:54.735]  But I'm not going to sit here now, while they're trying to start a civil war, and do all this, and now another group's awake.
[01:11:54.735 --> 01:12:05.661]  A few years ago, they couldn't get the Dallas police to attack us at the JFK Memorial, so they had the Democrat operative sheriff order the sheriff's department in Dallas, Lupe, whatever her name is, Obama minion, to attack us.
[01:12:06.783 --> 01:12:07.783]  There's footage of that obviously.
[01:12:07.783 --> 01:12:08.543]  It was all live.
[01:12:08.543 --> 01:12:11.744]  Millions of viewers on Ustream.
[01:12:11.744 --> 01:12:15.065]  At the time it happened.
[01:12:15.065 --> 01:12:19.686]  And there were federal buildings on both sides of it.
[01:12:19.686 --> 01:12:23.427]  There were all these people coming out, waving at us, saying they were listeners.
[01:12:23.427 --> 01:12:25.448]  And I mean, there's countless examples of this.
[01:12:25.448 --> 01:12:28.729]  I was at a Barnes & Noble.
[01:12:28.729 --> 01:12:33.110]  They must have been having some federal convention or something by it on a Saturday.
[01:12:35.506 --> 01:12:38.688]  No, no, it was a Friday because I was off work doing some stuff.
[01:12:38.688 --> 01:12:43.131]  And I mean, I was talking to people in there and I was like, do I know you?
[01:12:43.131 --> 01:12:46.033]  And the guy was like, yeah, yeah, no, you probably, you know, see me in a newscast or something.
[01:12:46.033 --> 01:12:50.536]  And it was like a, you know, senior local Fed saying, look, we know what's going on.
[01:12:50.536 --> 01:12:51.977]  We don't like what's happening.
[01:12:51.977 --> 01:12:54.218]  We appreciate the fact that you don't want a civil war.
[01:12:54.218 --> 01:12:55.279]  We know what's going on.
[01:12:55.279 --> 01:13:03.745]  And it's just countless examples of that where, again, I've talked to obviously a lot of people, you've heard the high level secret service on the air.
[01:13:04.847 --> 01:13:09.929]  But I've talked to people off record where they are scared, folks.
[01:13:09.929 --> 01:13:12.130]  And they go, look, man, it's worse than you're saying.
[01:13:12.130 --> 01:13:13.851]  I'm like, what do you mean it's worse than I'm saying?
[01:13:13.851 --> 01:13:14.351]  They go, it is.
[01:13:14.351 --> 01:13:15.952]  That's all I'm going to tell you.
[01:13:15.952 --> 01:13:17.053]  But you're dead on where you're going.
[01:13:17.053 --> 01:13:18.313]  But it's worse.
[01:13:18.313 --> 01:13:20.754]  I just don't know what to get my family out of the country.
[01:13:20.754 --> 01:13:26.277]  I mean, you know, it's it's it's I mean, it's bad, OK?
[01:13:26.277 --> 01:13:28.418]  I don't know all the stuff that's going on.
[01:13:28.418 --> 01:13:31.919]  But I heard from two different high level people.
[01:13:31.919 --> 01:13:32.920]  In the last month,
[01:13:34.949 --> 01:13:38.091]  I get chills talking about this, folks.
[01:13:38.091 --> 01:13:43.395]  That Obama is like a literal villain behind the scenes.
[01:13:43.395 --> 01:13:47.478]  And that they talk to the Secret Service like they are the dogs.
[01:13:47.478 --> 01:13:49.440]  And scream at them and tell them they're dumb idiots.
[01:13:49.440 --> 01:13:55.965]  And they say they can't get into all the stuff that's going on, but he's not just a Muslim sympathizer with radical Islam.
[01:13:55.965 --> 01:14:01.529]  Obama, folks, is hardcore Wahhabist.
[01:14:01.529 --> 01:14:02.470]  He is Al Qaeda.
[01:14:03.444 --> 01:14:05.786]  I mean, you talk about the ultimate twist, folks.
[01:14:05.786 --> 01:14:24.702]  The government of Saudi Arabia runs a terror attack on America, takes out Saddam who is fighting Al-Qaeda, loots that country, uses it as a base to invade Syria, destabilizes, overthrows our allies in Egypt, kills everybody in Libya, and then they put, and maybe that's a front to fool Saudi Arabia and the Muslims, I don't know, but let me tell you.
[01:14:25.646 --> 01:14:42.297]  He went to madrasas, he went to muslim schools, he has all these fake names, and he's got family that are muslims, that he wrote letters to as a senator about how to have riots so they would give him a position in the government, and they gave his cousin the prime ministership.
[01:14:42.297 --> 01:14:43.718]  And how did the radical muslims respond?
[01:14:43.718 --> 01:14:48.081]  They started blowing up buildings and shooting up shopping malls.
[01:14:48.081 --> 01:14:51.443]  And now his little buddies are over here attacking, and his answer is, take our guns!
[01:14:52.682 --> 01:14:57.005]  I mean, I cannot believe our elite would let somebody like this.
[01:14:57.005 --> 01:14:58.466]  I know they're crazy.
[01:14:58.466 --> 01:14:59.286]  I know they're out of control.
[01:14:59.286 --> 01:15:00.607]  I know they hate humanity.
[01:15:00.607 --> 01:15:10.313]  I know they're doing all these bad things, but man, it's crazy to have a guy that hates America, hates George Washington, hates Christians, hates the Second Amendment.
[01:15:10.313 --> 01:15:11.393]  By the way, we have Wayne Madsen.
[01:15:11.393 --> 01:15:12.054]  I apologize.
[01:15:12.054 --> 01:15:14.695]  I'm so flipped out over all this that I'm ranting.
[01:15:14.695 --> 01:15:16.156]  David Knight's riding shotgun with us.
[01:15:18.075 --> 01:15:22.179]  Is weeping that headlines at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:15:22.179 --> 01:15:27.045]  We should re-add my video where Obama caught fake crying years ago to these articles.
[01:15:27.045 --> 01:15:29.227]  Doctors can report mentally ill patients.
[01:15:29.227 --> 01:15:32.410]  The FBI under new Obama rule.
[01:15:32.410 --> 01:15:36.575]  Gun ban for some social security beneficiaries if you take automatic transfers.
[01:15:36.575 --> 01:15:38.256]  They're going to declare you incompetent.
[01:15:39.541 --> 01:15:40.622]  I mean, it is on.
[01:15:40.622 --> 01:15:42.063]  They are coming.
[01:15:42.063 --> 01:15:51.549]  New Obama gun rules require those selling guns, even a single one to a family member, or transferring it to be registered, national registry.
[01:15:51.549 --> 01:15:53.650]  This is the, a bunch of news is coming at the bottom of the hour.
[01:15:53.650 --> 01:15:57.953]  He'll ride shotgun with us, he's an InfoWars investigative journalist.
[01:15:57.953 --> 01:16:01.175]  Wayne Madsen, WayneMadsenReports.com.
[01:16:01.175 --> 01:16:05.858]  Wayne, formerly in the Navy in anti-submarine warfare.
[01:16:06.918 --> 01:16:07.238]  I don't know.
[01:16:22.329 --> 01:16:24.450]  You know, it's one thing to have a pill popping drunk like Nixon.
[01:16:24.450 --> 01:16:26.192]  At least they don't want to destroy the country.
[01:16:26.192 --> 01:16:29.494]  You've investigated Obama, written books about him like nobody else out there.
[01:16:29.494 --> 01:16:30.895]  You're not some right-winger.
[01:16:30.895 --> 01:16:34.617]  I'd call you more of an overall patriotic, libertarian, progressive.
[01:16:34.617 --> 01:16:37.439]  Not in the George Soros sense, but as a real one.
[01:16:37.439 --> 01:16:39.060]  Classical, liberal, whatever.
[01:16:39.060 --> 01:16:46.505]  I mean, you know, five years ago when you were saying, Obama, you know, does have weird Muslim ties, I was still poopooing that.
[01:16:46.505 --> 01:16:47.466]  I've got sources
[01:16:48.607 --> 01:16:49.487]  In the White House.
[01:16:49.487 --> 01:16:53.209]  I mean, I don't know if it's a sign off or whatever, but he's hitting his knees to Mecca.
[01:16:53.209 --> 01:16:55.089]  He's trying to destroy the country.
[01:16:55.089 --> 01:16:58.350]  I want to get into Soros funding attacks on Christians all over the world.
[01:16:58.350 --> 01:17:01.791]  I mean, what's the grand plan here, Wayne Madsen?
[01:17:01.791 --> 01:17:08.773]  Well, I think Soros is the master of chaos.
[01:17:08.773 --> 01:17:12.835]  He actually has figured out a way to make money
[01:17:14.033 --> 01:17:39.940]  Through constant disruption and constant chaos, whether it's financial chaos, how he shorts national currencies, or by funding these street demonstrations that eventually turn into full-scale coup d'etats like we saw happen in Ukraine and Georgia and in the so-called Arab Spring, which he bankrolled also Libya, Egypt, Tunisia.
[01:17:39.940 --> 01:17:43.061]  Funding the uprising in Syria with all of its
[01:17:43.621 --> 01:17:44.802]  Disastrous effects.
[01:17:44.802 --> 01:17:56.151]  And now we've got Soros telling Europe, yeah, you've taken in a million of these Muslim migrants, mostly from the Middle East and North Africa, but you can take in a few million more.
[01:17:56.151 --> 01:17:57.693]  And now it's being reported.
[01:17:57.693 --> 01:18:01.376]  It's not being reported here because of the political correctness issue.
[01:18:01.376 --> 01:18:07.281]  And I think Trump is really on to something with his tirade on political correctness.
[01:18:08.061 --> 01:18:12.362]  Uh, we just had, uh, reports on New Year's Eve out of Germany.
[01:18:12.362 --> 01:18:22.726]  Thousands of these, uh, jihadi gangbangers, uh, going around in wolf packs basically, raping German women who were out celebrating New Year's Eve.
[01:18:23.326 --> 01:18:24.387]  Oh, we have video of it.
[01:18:24.387 --> 01:18:25.647]  We're going to skip this network break.
[01:18:25.647 --> 01:18:26.667]  This is so important.
[01:18:26.667 --> 01:18:34.650]  Let's show the articles at InfoWars.com of mass gang rapes, 35 women raped at once, police standing down, churches being raided.
[01:18:34.650 --> 01:18:38.772]  I mean, this is a foaming at the mouth jihadis that couldn't take over Syria.
[01:18:38.772 --> 01:18:42.733]  The Russians kicked them out, so now they went back to Turkey and they dumped them in Europe.
[01:18:42.733 --> 01:18:44.074]  I mean, this is over the top.
[01:18:45.066 --> 01:18:51.911]  Yeah, and we have Turkey, you know, this Erdogan president becoming a neo-Ottoman emperor.
[01:18:51.911 --> 01:18:59.957]  And who does Obama use as his sounding board and as his advisor for issues in the Middle East?
[01:19:00.857 --> 01:19:02.018]  Talks to Erdogan.
[01:19:02.018 --> 01:19:13.829]  Erdogan, whose Muslim cleric just said that engaged couples in Turkey should not be walking around holding hands.
[01:19:13.829 --> 01:19:15.931]  Looks like Turkey is going to go back to the ways
[01:19:16.371 --> 01:19:17.011]  Yeah, I think so.
[01:19:32.722 --> 01:19:45.195]  When the United States ought to just switch sides and say, you Saudi Arabia, you did it on 9-11 with some of your friends, and now you're trying to get us into a major shooting war with Iran.
[01:19:45.195 --> 01:19:48.218]  By the way, we're retargeting our weapons.
[01:19:48.218 --> 01:19:50.520]  They're not pointing at Tehran anymore.
[01:19:50.520 --> 01:19:53.243]  They're pointing at Riyadh, Jeddah, and Mecca.
[01:19:55.077 --> 01:20:00.961]  Well, I tell you, Wayne, you can see Operation Chaos worldwide.
[01:20:00.961 --> 01:20:07.825]  Spectre doesn't exist in fantasy land, but it exists in the real world with just all Hades breaking loose.
[01:20:10.782 --> 01:20:14.885]  I gotta say, I supported the Bundys and others and my reporters when they went.
[01:20:14.885 --> 01:20:19.989]  When the Feds had kicked all 35 other ranching families off, they were the last family there.
[01:20:19.989 --> 01:20:23.572]  Harry Reid was in a land swap for solar panels in one area.
[01:20:23.572 --> 01:20:29.356]  This was going to be the environmental easement in the other.
[01:20:29.356 --> 01:20:36.802]  But now, them going in when they're not wanted by the locals and taking over this area, just the timing with Obama and his gun control push,
[01:20:38.240 --> 01:20:42.141]  And everything that's going on really, really smells to me.
[01:20:42.141 --> 01:20:44.502]  Again, I'm not saying they're bad.
[01:20:44.502 --> 01:20:56.166]  I'm saying the whole thing with it now, all over the news that, oh my gosh, white domestic terrorists are attacking, you know, all the, quote, Black Lives Matter people saying, you know, go kill them, send in the National Guard.
[01:20:56.166 --> 01:21:01.748]  I'm really concerned about them trying to kick off some type of civil unrest in this country on the back of the gun control.
[01:21:03.314 --> 01:21:08.262]  What's your take on that and do you have any ideas or strategies to try to navigate out of this?
[01:21:08.262 --> 01:21:15.913]  Then let's get into your article that we ran at Infowars.com yesterday dealing with Soros' top 10 hit list, Christians being number one.
[01:21:16.789 --> 01:21:20.731]  Well, people can always be used by those who have agendas.
[01:21:20.731 --> 01:21:23.752]  And remember Occupy Wall Street.
[01:21:23.752 --> 01:21:28.634]  Soros, of course, did provide some money for Occupy Wall Street.
[01:21:28.634 --> 01:21:35.277]  But then we had, as we started to see the Occupy movement gel in New York and Washington and L.A.
[01:21:35.277 --> 01:21:35.997]  and other cities,
[01:21:36.397 --> 01:21:53.303]  We had the FBI come out and they got caught because it was in their own documents that they were going to start using FBI snipers to pick off the leaders of the Occupy movement who were speaking in these various city centers.
[01:21:53.303 --> 01:21:59.165]  So there's a perfect example of how a guy like Soros will cooperate with the government to
[01:21:59.525 --> 01:22:03.851]  Basically surface the leadership for ulterior motives.
[01:22:03.851 --> 01:22:16.469]  And we saw, well, you can go back to the anti-Vietnam War protests when you had like the SDS occupying university offices, ROTC buildings on campuses.
[01:22:16.949 --> 01:22:27.232]  And later we found out a lot of these SDS members were FBI informants, so they were ratting out the people who wanted to keep it non-violent, of course.
[01:22:27.232 --> 01:22:35.735]  Absolutely, and then all I do, all I do is I come out Sunday and yesterday and I say, I support the overall idea of what the bunnies are doing.
[01:22:35.735 --> 01:22:41.316]  I know the Feds are grabbing these mines and property as part of the deindustrialization shutdown program, Agenda 21, Agenda 2030.
[01:22:43.871 --> 01:22:47.555]  But the timing and where you're at, please watch out for provocateurs.
[01:22:47.555 --> 01:22:49.517]  Watch out for infiltrators.
[01:22:49.517 --> 01:22:52.419]  Please, and I told the feds, please try to de-escalate.
[01:22:52.419 --> 01:22:56.123]  Don't play into the civil war plan that your foreign bosses want.
[01:22:56.123 --> 01:22:58.345]  Come on, let's really come together here.
[01:22:58.345 --> 01:22:59.827]  Let's not be stupid.
[01:22:59.827 --> 01:23:02.890]  I'm like a wartime broadcaster talking to both sides to not be idiots.
[01:23:03.832 --> 01:23:18.798]  And then the response is, people run up to my reporters, who are quote, you know, involved in all this, and some of the prominent people, who I don't even know their names, and they go, how dare Alex Jones say I'm a Fed, and Eamon Bundy's a Fed, and Joe's like, he never said that.
[01:23:18.798 --> 01:23:21.099]  Well, it doesn't matter, that's what we were told, so you're bad.
[01:23:21.099 --> 01:23:23.000]  I mean, obviously, who's telling them that?
[01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:27.922]  I mean, this is so textbook, how they cut these people out, how they manipulate them.
[01:23:27.922 --> 01:23:29.683]  It's just so sad how they play them.
[01:23:30.443 --> 01:23:35.046]  Uh, and it's just so I've been doing this for 20 plus years.
[01:23:35.046 --> 01:23:37.908]  I told people that the Atari militia was being infiltrated.
[01:23:37.908 --> 01:23:40.850]  And then six months later, they busted him and brought him down.
[01:23:40.850 --> 01:23:43.972]  And I worked to try to get the judge to drop the case.
[01:23:43.972 --> 01:23:44.813]  And they did.
[01:23:44.813 --> 01:23:46.814]  We blew that wide open.
[01:23:46.814 --> 01:23:51.617]  And then I don't even get thanks because a lot of the folks involved in aren't even smart enough.
[01:23:51.617 --> 01:23:54.139]  I'm just being serious to get what happened to him.
[01:23:54.139 --> 01:23:57.101]  I mean, it's like Nigerian emails.
[01:23:57.101 --> 01:23:58.862]  I remember this has been going on for about 16 17 years.
[01:24:00.043 --> 01:24:00.129]  Yeah.
[01:24:00.728 --> 01:24:11.591]  Where you get the email that Prince Habubu, or Habibi, or whatever they say it is at the time, literally, has $10,000 for you, but he's reached out to you because he's heard you're a wonderful person.
[01:24:11.591 --> 01:24:13.351]  These are target women.
[01:24:13.351 --> 01:24:17.733]  And that if you give them $10,000, he will give you $1,000,000 next week.
[01:24:17.733 --> 01:24:22.174]  You give him the $10,000, he goes, oh, the prince may be able to speak to you on the phone.
[01:24:22.174 --> 01:24:26.675]  Sorry, he's been arrested by King Agugu, or whatever they make up.
[01:24:26.675 --> 01:24:28.295]  I mean, it's literally ridiculous.
[01:24:28.295 --> 01:24:29.576]  You look it up, the people don't even exist.
[01:24:30.342 --> 01:24:38.248]  And then, you're already in for 10 grand con, so you don't want to admit it, and you decide to talk to Prince of Booboo, or BB, or whatever the name is.
[01:24:38.248 --> 01:24:40.310]  You want to believe you've won the lottery.
[01:24:40.310 --> 01:24:44.453]  Well, you start telling friends and family, do not give them more money, it's not real.
[01:24:44.453 --> 01:24:50.017]  They go, shut up, you're just jealous that I'm about to get 5 million now, and I give them another 20 grand.
[01:24:50.017 --> 01:24:51.898]  And you go, no, it's not real.
[01:24:52.799 --> 01:24:54.320]  It's a scam.
[01:24:54.320 --> 01:24:58.823]  And even when they give them the next round of money, I've known three people that did this.
[01:24:58.823 --> 01:25:01.285]  They will never talk to me again.
[01:25:01.285 --> 01:25:03.567]  They will not admit they were wrong.
[01:25:03.567 --> 01:25:05.748]  They will not admit they got conned.
[01:25:05.748 --> 01:25:11.532]  Just like Obama voters or whatever on the free health care of Obamacare and they double, triple prices.
[01:25:11.532 --> 01:25:14.895]  And there was literally a talk show host I knew.
[01:25:15.694 --> 01:25:18.235]  Who I heard on air one day.
[01:25:18.235 --> 01:25:19.655]  I thought it was a joke when I heard it.
[01:25:19.655 --> 01:25:20.775]  This was like 12, 13 years ago.
[01:25:20.775 --> 01:25:22.175]  This was about 14 years ago.
[01:25:22.175 --> 01:25:27.216]  Announcing that he had been contacted by a Nigerian prince that wanted to fund his show.
[01:25:27.216 --> 01:25:29.997]  And I called him and I said, it's not real.
[01:25:29.997 --> 01:25:33.578]  And he literally went on air and said, I was jealous, trying to stop it.
[01:25:33.578 --> 01:25:37.498]  And then later said, I jinxed the deal with the prince.
[01:25:37.498 --> 01:25:38.499]  I mean, it's the same thing.
[01:25:38.499 --> 01:25:39.699]  I'm like, look out for feds.
[01:25:40.339 --> 01:25:41.700]  They'll say I'm bad.
[01:25:41.700 --> 01:25:43.801]  They'll say, you know, violence is good, whatever.
[01:25:43.801 --> 01:25:45.062]  They'll try to escalate.
[01:25:45.062 --> 01:25:46.503]  Please watch out.
[01:25:46.503 --> 01:25:48.985]  And then that means I said they're feds.
[01:25:48.985 --> 01:25:55.229]  I mean, it's just so hard to deal with this psychology and quite frankly, Wayne, very, very sad.
[01:25:56.687 --> 01:26:17.431]  Well yeah, I mean, this is psychological warfare after all that's going on and unfortunately we see a lot of the media, for example NBC News, is not even reporting that these gangs of jihadi gangbangers are in fact from North Africa and the Middle East primarily.
[01:26:17.431 --> 01:26:20.312]  They're just saying they were young German men.
[01:26:20.312 --> 01:26:21.672]  Well first of all, they're not German.
[01:26:23.095 --> 01:26:25.257]  And second of all... So they don't just lie.
[01:26:25.257 --> 01:26:25.937]  They don't just lie.
[01:26:25.937 --> 01:26:27.279]  They scapegoat Germans.
[01:26:27.279 --> 01:26:29.300]  You know those Germans, they're really bad rapists.
[01:26:29.300 --> 01:26:31.162]  Let's repopulate Europe with radical Muslims.
[01:26:31.162 --> 01:26:32.523]  They don't rape women.
[01:26:32.523 --> 01:26:37.407]  Yeah, they're trying to... Maybe they'll blame Germans for beheading 47 people in Saudi Arabia Sunday.
[01:26:37.407 --> 01:26:38.047]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[01:26:38.047 --> 01:26:39.048]  Did you hear about the Germans?
[01:26:39.048 --> 01:26:39.849]  What they did in Saudi Arabia?
[01:26:40.629 --> 01:26:41.070]  Right.
[01:26:41.070 --> 01:26:49.097]  And the NBC and the Soros-linked media is trying to say, they're trying to say what happened in Germany is just part of the war on women.
[01:26:49.097 --> 01:26:50.518]  It has nothing to do with that.
[01:26:50.518 --> 01:26:59.387]  These are jihadists, gangbangers that the Soros people basically welcomed into Europe with all kinds of propaganda help and financial help.
[01:27:00.107 --> 01:27:00.427]  Exactly.
[01:27:00.427 --> 01:27:01.468]  There's your headline.
[01:27:01.468 --> 01:27:06.652]  Feminists recycle radical Muslim rapes to demonize men.
[01:27:06.652 --> 01:27:10.234]  What is the sick leftist alignment with radical Islam?
[01:27:10.234 --> 01:27:12.776]  Because both you and I were against the clash of civilizations.
[01:27:12.776 --> 01:27:13.996]  We were against all these invasions.
[01:27:13.996 --> 01:27:14.817]  You've been to Libya.
[01:27:14.817 --> 01:27:15.597]  You've been to Syria.
[01:27:15.597 --> 01:27:18.960]  You've been in daring coverage when you're getting, I know, shot at.
[01:27:19.700 --> 01:27:21.121]  Uh, you know, and bombs are going off.
[01:27:21.121 --> 01:27:23.301]  I mean, you're a real war correspondent.
[01:27:23.301 --> 01:27:31.504]  And, you know, you're not against Muslims, but my God, we don't have to take all their 18-year-old jihadists that got their butts kicked in Syria to come rape our women!
[01:27:31.504 --> 01:27:33.844]  And then have Gloria Steinem tell us we did it!
[01:27:33.844 --> 01:27:35.505]  No, you witch, we didn't do it!
[01:27:35.505 --> 01:27:38.066]  Western men treat women the best, you witch!
[01:27:38.926 --> 01:27:40.007]  Well, it's funny.
[01:27:40.007 --> 01:27:49.690]  In the city of Cologne, where some of these Muslim gang rapes took place, the mayor was attacked by a so-called right-winger wielding a knife.
[01:27:49.690 --> 01:27:51.311]  They said he got her in the neck.
[01:27:51.311 --> 01:27:56.653]  And she's basically a member of the Social Democratic Green Party Alliance.
[01:27:56.653 --> 01:28:07.938]  She was welcoming these migrants into Germany, and now she's bemoaning the fact that they were raping German women on the streets of her city in Cologne or Kuhn, as it is in Europe.
[01:28:09.058 --> 01:28:11.420]  Exactly, and we've showed the clips.
[01:28:11.420 --> 01:28:17.826]  Two of the Green Party leaders in Germany have openly said it's good that whites are going to be gotten rid of, Germans are bad.
[01:28:17.826 --> 01:28:18.967]  These are Germans.
[01:28:18.967 --> 01:28:20.829]  Thank God we're herding into Islam.
[01:28:20.829 --> 01:28:25.913]  Well, why don't they move to Saudi Arabia then and these women can squat in a slave pit?
[01:28:25.913 --> 01:28:26.534]  Go ahead, sorry.
[01:28:27.395 --> 01:28:28.136]  Well, yeah.
[01:28:28.136 --> 01:28:33.599]  So we had, of course, the Soros gang, which really runs the European Union.
[01:28:33.599 --> 01:28:40.324]  The European Union is basically a contrivance for people like Soros and his banker friends.
[01:28:40.324 --> 01:28:43.386]  You know, they put pressure on all these members of the EU.
[01:28:43.386 --> 01:28:53.373]  You've got to take in so many of these refugees, so-called refugees, when we know that Erdogan in Turkey was pipelining these basically young men.
[01:28:53.373 --> 01:28:54.734]  And then the Saudis said, oh, well,
[01:28:55.254 --> 01:28:56.015]  We're good.
[01:29:12.773 --> 01:29:13.113]  I agree.
[01:29:31.499 --> 01:29:32.500]  Stay there, stay there.
[01:29:32.500 --> 01:29:40.104]  Let's talk about the huge Sunni-Shiite civil war that's now raging across Africa, the Middle East and Asia, now being exported to Europe.
[01:29:40.104 --> 01:29:42.345]  David Neidl chimed in with breaking news.
[01:29:42.345 --> 01:29:44.366]  Obama has thrown down the gauntlet.
[01:29:44.366 --> 01:29:47.388]  Unprecedented massive gun grabs now taking place.
[01:29:47.388 --> 01:29:48.668]  This is it, folks, the beginning.
[01:29:48.668 --> 01:29:49.909]  We're on the march.
[01:29:49.909 --> 01:29:52.430]  The empire's on the run.
[01:29:52.430 --> 01:29:55.112]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:59.622 --> 01:30:11.072]  Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid wants the Federal Election Commission to make an exemption and allow him to pocket over $600,000 for retirement from a slush fund.
[01:30:11.072 --> 01:30:15.737]  FEC guidelines prohibit personal use of unspent PAC and campaign money.
[01:30:16.337 --> 01:30:22.902]  Punishment for violating the prohibition on personal use ranges from hefty fines to possible imprisonment.
[01:30:22.902 --> 01:30:28.726]  The money can be used as a contribution to charity or donated to the National Party Committee.
[01:30:28.726 --> 01:30:31.188]  Democrat FBC Chairwoman Anne Ravel.
[01:30:31.488 --> 01:30:39.996]  Believes Reed has the right to the money due to his status as a, quote, historic and important figure and public official, end quote.
[01:30:39.996 --> 01:30:43.880]  The FEC has deferred action on Reed's request.
[01:30:43.880 --> 01:30:50.926]  FEC Commissioner Lee E. Goodman believes granting the request will send the wrong message and set a precedent.
[01:30:50.926 --> 01:30:54.830]  You can find more reports on InfoWars.com.
[01:30:59.034 --> 01:31:01.217]  It has happened.
[01:31:01.217 --> 01:31:04.281]  2015 has passed into history, into lore.
[01:31:04.281 --> 01:31:07.606]  But now, 2016 has been born.
[01:31:07.606 --> 01:31:11.391]  And the decision lies in your hands to forge the destiny!
[01:31:11.391 --> 01:31:12.813]  Whoa, whoa, whoa!
[01:31:13.834 --> 01:31:18.255]  That's a little too epic, that Hollywood action-adventure science-fiction voice I'm using.
[01:31:18.255 --> 01:31:26.838]  But quite frankly, that's how I feel like I should be talking about what happens when your body actually gets the real natural nutrients it needs.

[01:31:52.433 --> 01:31:53.294]  I just did it again.
[01:31:53.294 --> 01:31:54.936]  I can't help but get excited.

[01:31:55.757 --> 01:31:56.798]  Fight the globalists!

[01:31:57.639 --> 01:31:58.220]  Yeah!
[01:31:58.960 --> 01:32:02.941]  Secret 12, InfoWarsLife's vitamin B12 formulation.
[01:32:02.941 --> 01:32:09.242]  Most forms of vitamin B12 are highly processed and synthetic, and cannot be properly absorbed by the body.
[01:32:09.242 --> 01:32:16.524]  That's why for real results, so many are having to turn to painful B12 injections, which are known to have higher absorption rates.
[01:32:16.524 --> 01:32:25.326]  InfoWarsLife.com is excited to announce that we can bring you our most bioactive, powerful form of B12 that has been developed with our exclusive, perfected process.
[01:32:25.626 --> 01:32:31.810]  Secret 12 is a binary of nutrimedical grade, bioavailable coenzyme forms of B12.
[01:32:31.810 --> 01:32:36.633]  Methylcobalamin, the same kind used in B12 injections, and adenosylcobalamin.
[01:32:36.633 --> 01:32:40.235]  Secret 12 is simply taken by mouth, right on the tongue, and then swallowed.
[01:32:40.235 --> 01:32:42.116]  No needles, no injections.
[01:32:42.116 --> 01:32:43.777]  Don't take my word for it.
[01:32:43.777 --> 01:32:44.977]  Try it for yourself.
[01:32:44.977 --> 01:32:47.279]  Discover the secret, Secret 12.

[01:33:16.261 --> 01:33:33.153]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:33.153 --> 01:33:39.478]  We're brought up to believe
[01:33:41.647 --> 01:33:44.929]  That the last generation went through the incredible times.
[01:33:44.929 --> 01:33:46.750]  That the last generation fought the big wars.
[01:33:46.750 --> 01:33:50.632]  That the last generation somehow lived in a more exciting reality than we do.
[01:33:50.632 --> 01:33:57.456]  I think that happens to every generation and every culture throughout civilization's history.
[01:33:57.456 --> 01:34:05.120]  But in the modern world, people at a subconscious level almost believe entertainment and TV is real.
[01:34:05.120 --> 01:34:06.641]  They believe reality TV is real.
[01:34:06.641 --> 01:34:08.062]  It's some of the fakest television out there.
[01:34:09.753 --> 01:34:18.475]  Up until the time I was about four, I thought that the world was black and white when movies were black and white.
[01:34:18.475 --> 01:34:22.737]  And then finally, I was sitting there watching Gilligan's Island one day, and it was color.
[01:34:22.737 --> 01:34:24.717]  My dad said, no son, it's film.
[01:34:24.717 --> 01:34:27.778]  The world was always color.
[01:34:27.778 --> 01:34:31.679]  But the first season of Gilligan's Island was shot in black and white.
[01:34:31.679 --> 01:34:35.340]  But color film with Technicolor got cheaper by the second season.
[01:34:37.637 --> 01:34:42.458]  And then he explained to me about film cameras and he had film cameras and was into photography then with my mother.
[01:34:42.458 --> 01:34:49.220]  And we went and shot some fun home movies.
[01:34:49.220 --> 01:34:51.701]  But I liken it to that, people's perspective.
[01:34:51.701 --> 01:34:54.201]  It's like, back then the world was black and white.
[01:34:54.201 --> 01:34:55.622]  Back then the world was different.
[01:34:55.622 --> 01:34:57.342]  Now we're in a different world.
[01:34:57.342 --> 01:35:00.783]  We are lined up to have wars much bigger than World War II.
[01:35:01.837 --> 01:35:06.079]  The stock market, I don't know when it's going to die, but it's all based on total fraud.
[01:35:06.079 --> 01:35:10.922]  It can't go on forever, and it's been plunging 200, 300, 400 points Friday, Monday, and today.
[01:35:10.922 --> 01:35:12.003]  I mean, where is it right now?
[01:35:12.003 --> 01:35:12.803]  We can put it on screen.
[01:35:12.803 --> 01:35:13.884]  I hope it goes back up.
[01:35:13.884 --> 01:35:19.187]  Even though it's fiat and pure garbage, I'm not here cheerleading for it to fall.
[01:35:19.187 --> 01:35:21.368]  I mean, I got a family.
[01:35:21.368 --> 01:35:26.511]  I just want good medicine, private property, a right to be free, a right to be a father.
[01:35:26.511 --> 01:35:28.352]  The system's trying to undermine that.
[01:35:30.981 --> 01:35:31.841]  We're being captured.
[01:35:31.841 --> 01:35:33.522]  We're being enslaved.
[01:35:33.522 --> 01:35:35.423]  We're going into a system of conquest.
[01:35:35.423 --> 01:35:39.925]  And David Knight is riding shotgun with us back at the Infowars News Center.
[01:35:39.925 --> 01:35:44.406]  I got an interview with Louis Farrakhan, and he doesn't do a lot of interviews, folks.
[01:35:44.406 --> 01:35:46.447]  Especially with outside media.
[01:35:46.447 --> 01:35:50.529]  And I got there, and what I thought was the case, I mean, they're all daily listeners.
[01:35:50.529 --> 01:35:55.391]  Louis Farrakhan listens to the show basically all the time.
[01:35:55.391 --> 01:35:55.931]  Every few days.
[01:35:56.988 --> 01:35:59.489]  They had a computer just turn on and my show was playing.
[01:35:59.489 --> 01:36:04.850]  I mean, it was like, it was over the top.
[01:36:04.850 --> 01:36:07.271]  People say, well, Louis Farrakhan, he says, kill the police.
[01:36:07.271 --> 01:36:10.852]  Well, he said, if they shoot us in the back, we should go after the officers that did it.
[01:36:10.852 --> 01:36:12.533]  And it's incendiary and we talk about it in the interview.
[01:36:12.533 --> 01:36:16.854]  It doesn't mean I agree with everything he says, but it's about opening a dialogue.
[01:36:16.854 --> 01:36:23.656]  And if we get Louis Farrakhan, which he's already doing, calling for cooler heads to prevail and not to buy into this George Soros civil war,
[01:36:25.225 --> 01:36:27.486]  It's going to be a big, big deal.
[01:36:27.486 --> 01:36:39.568]  And the fact that a William Binney's a listener, a Matt Drudge is a listener, Donald Trump's crew are listeners, Trump's familiar with the show for years, wouldn't call him a listener.
[01:36:39.568 --> 01:36:45.090]  The fact that so many prominent people, generals, you name it, it's not about Alex Jones.
[01:36:45.090 --> 01:36:49.231]  It's about the fact that we've got a lot more things in common than we've got indifference.
[01:36:51.141 --> 01:37:15.675]  The New World Order did a really good job in the 80s and 90s going in, taking over militias, leading a lot of them, making them anti-government, making them all paranoid and hiding out so they could be controlled to create a narrative like there's the militias creeping around to get you when they're as constitutional as George Washington and should be out in the open doing open carries like we did with the Texas Land Commissioner Jerry Patterson last year.
[01:37:16.564 --> 01:37:17.805]  With 1,500 people.
[01:37:17.805 --> 01:37:19.286]  They hated that.
[01:37:19.286 --> 01:37:22.849]  And they voted out those illegal laws after that.
[01:37:22.849 --> 01:37:26.091]  And we go out and march with guns, you know, openly when the police say they're going to arrest us.
[01:37:26.091 --> 01:37:35.538]  I mean, we do civil disobedience, folks, but we smile at the police while we do it.
[01:37:35.538 --> 01:37:37.379]  And they smile back at us.
[01:37:37.379 --> 01:37:39.261]  There's a few bad ones, a few punks, but, I mean,
[01:37:40.424 --> 01:37:42.805]  The globalists want to trick us to kill each other.
[01:37:42.805 --> 01:37:44.046]  I don't want to hurt black people.
[01:37:44.046 --> 01:37:45.747]  They don't want to hurt me on average.
[01:37:45.747 --> 01:37:48.168]  If they can be wound up and tricked by George Soros, they are.
[01:37:48.168 --> 01:37:49.869]  And they're going to be set up.
[01:37:49.869 --> 01:37:55.752]  And I mean, Farrakhan talked about how Obama was set to set black people up and about, you know, just the whole agenda.
[01:37:57.546 --> 01:38:02.751]  It was unprecedented, and I want to put out the whole two-hour interview, but something this hot can't wait.
[01:38:02.751 --> 01:38:04.693]  You know, last night I was at dinner with Faircon.
[01:38:04.693 --> 01:38:05.954]  They were wanting to put it out quicker.
[01:38:05.954 --> 01:38:10.778]  So we're going to go meet with them today before I leave, and I guess we're just going to... I guess they're probably right.
[01:38:10.778 --> 01:38:11.639]  We'll talk to them.
[01:38:11.639 --> 01:38:19.566]  It'll at least take a week, though, to get all the clips really good and coordinate and promote it with a few promo clips and things, but we'll just put the whole thing out end-to-end.
[01:38:20.521 --> 01:38:25.649]  I wanted to do the interview where we talk about things historical and play clips and make a documentary.
[01:38:25.649 --> 01:38:30.937]  We'll do that down the road, but I want to be the guy that gets the big interview that nobody else can get.
[01:38:31.564 --> 01:38:32.725]  With the Donald Trump.
[01:38:32.725 --> 01:38:33.426]  But he does interviews.
[01:38:33.426 --> 01:38:34.206]  With the Matt Drudge.
[01:38:34.206 --> 01:38:36.208]  With the Louis Farrakhan.
[01:38:36.208 --> 01:38:37.989]  With the David Icke joining us tomorrow.
[01:38:37.989 --> 01:38:40.491]  Just to get people outside of the box.
[01:38:40.491 --> 01:38:42.513]  Going back to Wayne Madsen here in a moment.
[01:38:42.513 --> 01:38:44.895]  Roger Shotgun with us a little bit in the next hour.
[01:38:44.895 --> 01:38:49.879]  Wayne's got some big reports he wants to go do here in the near future that I'm not going to mention on air, but they're big.
[01:38:49.879 --> 01:38:51.861]  I'm looking at funding to decide whether we can do it.
[01:38:52.930 --> 01:38:56.412]  Because he does do things on a shoestring budget, but it still taxes us.
[01:38:56.412 --> 01:39:05.159]  But I think I'm going to probably send him on his next mission if we can really confirm he's going to be able to do the things we're looking at doing in Europe and in England.
[01:39:05.159 --> 01:39:15.966]  But that's why it's more important than ever that you buy the books, you buy the videos, you buy the Hilary Ford prison t-shirts that are selling out as limited edition when they're gone, they're gone.
[01:39:15.966 --> 01:39:21.630]  That you get the New Year's special of Deep Cleanse and X2 and Secret 12.
[01:39:22.999 --> 01:39:27.122]  Incredible detoxification for your body in the new year.
[01:39:27.122 --> 01:39:30.524]  So much of what you do isn't even exercise, it's what you put in your body.
[01:39:30.524 --> 01:39:32.585]  I mean, if this doesn't game-change for you, I'll eat my hat.
[01:39:32.585 --> 01:39:48.456]  4.8 star ratings in third-party sites, InfoWarsLive.com, 15% off everything in the store, on top of discounts on many products, with promo code GIFT15 at checkout, and we need the funds to be strong.
[01:39:48.456 --> 01:39:51.458]  I mean, quite frankly, I could use a hundred times the funds I have.
[01:39:52.335 --> 01:40:03.027]  I mean, I spend so much time scrabbling around, worrying about how much stuff costs, equipment, reporters, you name it, when I could just really not worry about financing.
[01:40:03.027 --> 01:40:04.229]  We've already done what other people haven't done.
[01:40:04.229 --> 01:40:05.991]  Thanks for your support out there and your prayers.
[01:40:05.991 --> 01:40:10.295]  But we need folks to spread the word about the broadcast and send the links to the show, the videos, the articles out.
[01:40:11.423 --> 01:40:13.325]  Infowars.com forward slash show.
[01:40:13.325 --> 01:40:15.666]  We need people to put us on their Facebook, their Twitter.
[01:40:15.666 --> 01:40:16.367]  The trolls hate it.
[01:40:16.367 --> 01:40:18.789]  They go, how dare you be on Facebook here with Zuckerberg?
[01:40:18.789 --> 01:40:20.830]  We're invading Zuckerberg.
[01:40:20.830 --> 01:40:22.652]  We fight on the battlefield.
[01:40:22.652 --> 01:40:23.512]  Be like in the Matrix.
[01:40:23.512 --> 01:40:25.754]  How dare you inject into the Matrix, Neo?
[01:40:25.754 --> 01:40:26.815]  You're with the Matrix.
[01:40:26.815 --> 01:40:27.255]  No, he's not.
[01:40:27.255 --> 01:40:29.036]  He's going into the Matrix.
[01:40:29.036 --> 01:40:32.499]  We're outside the Matrix, but we go into the Matrix.
[01:40:32.499 --> 01:40:36.042]  And we engage on Infowars and Prison Planet in our own right.
[01:40:37.369 --> 01:40:44.516]  Those are launchpads to YouTube and everywhere else, and we're going to continue to hurt the globalists and get billions of views in the aggregate on YouTube alone.
[01:40:44.516 --> 01:40:50.082]  PrisonPlanet.tv, 15 cents a day, week-to-week, $5.95.
[01:40:50.082 --> 01:40:51.904]  But get a yearly membership.
[01:40:51.904 --> 01:40:53.045]  It ends in just a few weeks.
[01:40:53.045 --> 01:40:54.206]  Want to run it for two more weeks?
[01:40:54.206 --> 01:40:55.668]  Or maybe a week or so?
[01:40:55.668 --> 01:40:56.409]  The New Year Special.
[01:40:57.708 --> 01:40:59.069]  You can get six months free.
[01:40:59.069 --> 01:41:01.090]  We've never offered six months free when you sign up for a year.
[01:41:01.090 --> 01:41:02.812]  You pay for six months, you get six months.
[01:41:02.812 --> 01:41:05.433]  Twenty people can use each membership.
[01:41:05.433 --> 01:41:07.775]  It's meant for activism.
[01:41:07.775 --> 01:41:12.278]  But whether you share the membership or don't, PrisonPlanet.tv, go join.
[01:41:12.278 --> 01:41:14.400]  I want to thank those that are members.

[01:41:45.100 --> 01:41:46.722]  Take action today.
[01:41:46.722 --> 01:41:49.044]  All right, I want to bring Wayne Madsen back in here.
[01:41:49.044 --> 01:41:51.287]  He's with us 20 minutes, 30 minutes, the next hour.
[01:41:51.287 --> 01:41:52.748]  And Joe Biggs joins us from Oregon.
[01:41:52.748 --> 01:41:56.732]  But I get excited because this is an epic time to be alive.
[01:41:56.732 --> 01:41:59.375]  I want to get into what Wayne just mentioned.
[01:41:59.375 --> 01:42:02.739]  That's why I love Wayne, because I forget to get to stuff and he covers it.
[01:42:02.739 --> 01:42:04.120]  USA Today's cover.
[01:42:04.120 --> 01:42:07.404]  Saudis cut ties to Iran as crisis intensifies.
[01:42:08.746 --> 01:42:21.076]  We're going to get into this here with him in a moment, but just sitting back, being in the middle of Infowars for three plus years now, David, watching everything we've warned of unfolding, we don't, I know, enjoy the fact we've been proven right.
[01:42:21.076 --> 01:42:25.920]  I am horrified that we've been dead on, except for it being worse than we thought.
[01:42:25.920 --> 01:42:28.502]  I mean, I am horrified.
[01:42:29.969 --> 01:42:40.078]  I didn't get giddy when another high-level source told me that no, Obama is a radical Wahhabist and prays to Mecca in the White House and hates America and wants to bring America down.
[01:42:40.078 --> 01:42:44.782]  I didn't think, oh, I've got a big story, oh, this is great.
[01:42:44.782 --> 01:42:46.964]  I got physically nauseous.
[01:42:46.964 --> 01:42:51.868]  Literally, when I got in my car later, shook some.
[01:42:53.314 --> 01:42:59.139]  Almost had to pull over and throw up because of the sadness of the deceptions, the lies.
[01:42:59.139 --> 01:43:00.240]  What's coming next?
[01:43:00.240 --> 01:43:08.307]  I mean, I just... The danger of the position we're in, the responsibility we have.
[01:43:08.307 --> 01:43:16.834]  You know, it's just good people have laid down, so now every weirdo crazy has taken over because they have an appetite to dominate us.
[01:43:16.834 --> 01:43:18.556]  David Knight, then we're going to go back to Wayne Madsen.
[01:43:19.147 --> 01:43:29.894]  Yeah, Alex, you know, what you're saying about Louis Farrakhan, I haven't seen that interview, but the things that you're saying sounds very much like what we've heard from Larry Pinckney, who used to be with the old Black Panthers.
[01:43:29.894 --> 01:43:34.797]  He said they weren't a threat to the government as long as they stayed within the black community.
[01:43:34.797 --> 01:43:43.063]  Once they started reaching out and saying, you know what, this is a problem we all need to come together with, that's when they came after them with agent provocateurs, shut them down.
[01:43:43.063 --> 01:43:46.165]  By the way, Farrakhan said, because he's now doing that,
[01:43:46.305 --> 01:43:48.146]  I'm not going to interrupt you, you just bring up such good points.
[01:43:48.146 --> 01:43:50.108]  He sat at dinner for three hours.
[01:43:50.108 --> 01:43:51.289]  He even let us record some of it.
[01:43:51.289 --> 01:43:54.391]  He let me record the whole thing, but I forgot to record until I asked halfway through.
[01:43:54.391 --> 01:44:00.315]  He said, they're coming to kill me because I want to bring people together, and I'm going to... You're absolutely right, go ahead.
[01:44:00.315 --> 01:44:06.179]  Same thing with Malcolm X. That's what happened with Malcolm X. He stopped looking just within the black community.
[01:44:06.179 --> 01:44:09.782]  He started to realize, hey, this is a much larger issue, number one.
[01:44:09.782 --> 01:44:12.083]  Number two, as we've pointed out many times,
[01:44:13.004 --> 01:44:15.646]  Everyone needs to come together to solve this problem.
[01:44:15.646 --> 01:44:21.030]  White people need to understand they're next on the list, and it's already happening to white people in a large degree.
[01:44:21.030 --> 01:44:27.556]  They don't have the kind of close community that the black people do, or that awareness, that hyper-awareness of the oppression.
[01:44:27.556 --> 01:44:32.760]  But yeah, it's coming to everybody, and the black people need to understand they're not going to be able to turn this back unless
[01:44:33.280 --> 01:44:36.522]  The white community in general understands that it's their problem too.
[01:44:36.522 --> 01:44:41.364]  So that's the part about Black Lives Matter that George Soros put in that is so dangerous.
[01:44:41.364 --> 01:44:43.145]  Because it compartmentalizes people.
[01:44:43.145 --> 01:44:45.627]  It breaks them into little groups that can't do anything.
[01:44:45.627 --> 01:44:46.487]  That's why we need to come together.
[01:44:46.487 --> 01:44:50.329]  That's the New York City, big city Democrat mafia model.
[01:44:50.329 --> 01:44:51.950]  The Republicans play it too.
[01:44:51.950 --> 01:44:54.612]  But I mean, I literally grew up with Christian
[01:44:55.612 --> 01:44:59.354]  Somewhat conservative parents, but they were very liberal when it came to civil rights.
[01:44:59.354 --> 01:45:12.482]  My grandfather had come back from World War II, whole family were Democrats, ran for county office, won on an Eisenhower ticket of ending, you know, Jim Crow and all the rest of it.
[01:45:12.482 --> 01:45:22.509]  And so, you know, I grew up never hearing racist comments, never hearing, in fact, hearing white guilt that we've been oppressive and bad need to build people up.
[01:45:23.449 --> 01:45:27.511]  And so that's why then here the left is claiming I'm this racist makes me so angry.
[01:45:27.511 --> 01:45:37.515]  But then it wasn't till I got around Democrats and abortion people behind the scenes in New York and Chicago that the upper class black people and whites literally get off
[01:45:38.587 --> 01:45:41.708]  On keeping black people down and feeding on them and watching them kill each other.
[01:45:41.708 --> 01:45:45.130]  It's sick, it's disgusting, and they're filth!
[01:45:45.130 --> 01:45:46.691]  They are filth!
[01:45:46.691 --> 01:45:51.853]  It's just like a radical feminist blaming Germans for all the raping when it's their darling radical Muslims they brought in.
[01:45:51.853 --> 01:45:52.833]  Sorry, David, go ahead.
[01:45:52.833 --> 01:45:56.535]  Oh yeah, and we just had a quote that the crew put up there from Malcolm X. I'm paraphrasing.
[01:45:56.535 --> 01:46:02.398]  He goes, if you're not careful, the media is going to have you hating the people who are oppressed and loving the oppressors.
[01:46:02.398 --> 01:46:03.698]  And that's exactly right.
[01:46:03.698 --> 01:46:04.579]  What happened in
[01:46:05.479 --> 01:46:10.703]  In the German situation in Cologne, they had video footage of this.
[01:46:10.703 --> 01:46:12.804]  And they knew that this wasn't Germans.
[01:46:12.804 --> 01:46:14.625]  You could see very clearly who was doing this.
[01:46:14.625 --> 01:46:15.886]  They withheld that information.
[01:46:15.886 --> 01:46:18.007]  That's why people were saying, wait a minute, you're covering this up.
[01:46:18.007 --> 01:46:21.510]  They withheld it for several days before it eventually made its way out.
[01:46:21.510 --> 01:46:23.231]  The truth eventually does come out.
[01:46:23.231 --> 01:46:27.154]  But they wanted to hide that because they've got an agenda.
[01:46:27.154 --> 01:46:34.999]  They realize that they can bring new people in, bring people in from areas that our government, the European government, NATO have gone in.
[01:46:35.459 --> 01:46:37.460]  Created a war in their country, created hatred.
[01:46:37.460 --> 01:46:38.920]  Bring those people in from the war zones.
[01:46:38.920 --> 01:46:40.841]  It's an organized takeover.
[01:46:40.841 --> 01:46:41.101]  Yes.
[01:46:41.101 --> 01:46:50.304]  As the Hungarian, the Romanian presidents have said, and now the Swiss top general has told the Swiss, train, get more guns, they're collapsed in Europe, prepare for civil unrest.
[01:46:50.304 --> 01:46:52.024]  The story's on InfoWars.com.
[01:46:52.024 --> 01:46:53.085]  Absolutely, David.
[01:46:53.085 --> 01:46:57.266]  Let's go back to InfoWars.com reporter, Wayne Madsen Report.com.
[01:46:57.266 --> 01:46:59.967]  Wayne Madsen, with us 20 minutes, 30 minutes to the next hour.
[01:47:00.447 --> 01:47:02.988]  Wayne, thank you for riding shotgun and giving commentary today.
[01:47:02.988 --> 01:47:11.453]  Let's get into the larger destabilization, because they're not just attacking us, they're using the crisis to attack Muslims as well, destabilizing them.
[01:47:11.453 --> 01:47:21.978]  If we think we've got refugees now, we already have a major civil war between Shiite and Sunni kicked off by the CIA on record, quarterbacked by Saudi Arabia.
[01:47:21.978 --> 01:47:24.740]  You're the expert on this, been in the Middle East scores of times.
[01:47:24.740 --> 01:47:26.381]  What's happening right now, Wayne Madsen?
[01:47:27.045 --> 01:47:45.533]  Well, what's happening is that the Turks and the Saudis are forming an alliance, and the Turks, which were always known as secular since the days of Kemal Ataturk, the founder of the Turkish Republic after the fall of the Ottomans, we're seeing this alliance of Wahhabist Muslim Brotherhood
[01:47:46.053 --> 01:47:48.415]  Alliance come into play here.
[01:47:48.415 --> 01:47:58.624]  And right now, you've got, Soros was recently in Istanbul where he met with Erdogan, the Turkish President.
[01:47:58.624 --> 01:48:06.911]  Obama's Middle East Council, Mr. Erdogan, the Neo-Sultan of Turkey.
[01:48:06.911 --> 01:48:12.276]  And he doesn't try to stage any demonstrations against Erdogan, even though Erdogan is
[01:48:12.836 --> 01:48:16.959]  Trying to institute Sharia law in Turkey.
[01:48:16.959 --> 01:48:20.961]  It's little baby steps now.
[01:48:20.961 --> 01:48:23.863]  So what did Soros do in Ukraine, for example?
[01:48:23.863 --> 01:48:37.052]  He overthrew a democratically elected president, and now we've got neo-Nazi battalions fighting alongside Chechen Muslim terrorists, fresh from the battlefield in Syria, fighting Russian
[01:48:37.452 --> 01:48:38.013]  I don't think so.
[01:48:55.097 --> 01:48:56.998]  It's not Spectre.
[01:48:56.998 --> 01:49:01.202]  The villain is working for a group called Quantum.
[01:49:01.202 --> 01:49:05.746]  It's no mistake that Soros' hedge fund is called Quantum.
[01:49:05.746 --> 01:49:08.048]  The villain Blofeld
[01:49:08.628 --> 01:49:17.118]  In the last Bond movie is Quantum, basically bringing in all the past, the last, I guess... They're telling us it's Soros!
[01:49:17.118 --> 01:49:19.001]  They're rubbing our faces!
[01:49:19.001 --> 01:49:25.889]  It's Soros, yes, because the British establishment, MI6, which basically has approved every
[01:49:26.489 --> 01:49:27.890]  Let me ask you this.
[01:49:27.890 --> 01:49:29.871]  He's tried to drive down the pound.
[01:49:29.871 --> 01:49:31.892]  He's tried to destroy the U.S.
[01:49:31.892 --> 01:49:35.613]  Why do our elites put up with him when he would butcher them if he could?
[01:49:35.613 --> 01:49:37.014]  I mean, this guy's dangerous.
[01:49:46.858 --> 01:49:50.401]  He's a multinational octopus.
[01:49:50.401 --> 01:49:52.663]  He's got so many people.
[01:49:52.663 --> 01:49:54.685]  Look, he bought Human Rights Watch.
[01:49:54.685 --> 01:49:58.088]  He gave them $100 million.
[01:49:58.088 --> 01:50:01.130]  He's given massive amounts of money to Amnesty International.
[01:50:01.130 --> 01:50:02.772]  So what he's done is he's bought up.
[01:50:03.332 --> 01:50:07.734]  The NGO community, the groups, I used to work with these groups.
[01:50:07.734 --> 01:50:14.197]  I won't have anything to do with them anymore because I see that they play into this propaganda.
[01:50:14.197 --> 01:50:17.079]  They help Soros bring down governments.
[01:50:17.079 --> 01:50:29.965]  Assad is the bad guy, but the jihadists in Syria, they're okay when a bunch of them pick up stakes, move to Cologne and are raping as many German women as they could on New Year's Eve.
[01:50:30.725 --> 01:50:33.707]  Why does Soros have it out for Christians?
[01:50:33.707 --> 01:50:36.028]  And why does he enjoy ratting out Jews so much?
[01:50:36.028 --> 01:50:37.109]  I mean, he's just a filth.
[01:50:37.109 --> 01:50:38.710]  He's a filth!
[01:50:38.710 --> 01:50:39.911]  Absolutely.
[01:50:39.911 --> 01:50:40.251]  Stay there.
[01:50:40.251 --> 01:50:41.432]  I want to come back and ask you.
[01:50:41.432 --> 01:50:42.633]  Your psychological breakdown.
[01:50:42.633 --> 01:50:44.594]  Former NSA officer, high level.
[01:50:44.594 --> 01:50:47.416]  Ran basically security at the NSA.
[01:50:47.416 --> 01:50:48.917]  Joining us, breaking all this down.
[01:50:48.917 --> 01:50:50.518]  And David Knight's riding shotgun.
[01:50:50.518 --> 01:50:52.379]  I'm in Phoenix, Arizona.
[01:50:52.379 --> 01:50:53.820]  Just interviewed Louis Farrakhan.
[01:50:53.820 --> 01:50:55.421]  It's a bombshell interview.
[01:50:55.421 --> 01:50:56.722]  It'll be national news, folks.
[01:50:59.175 --> 01:51:00.375]  Are you prepared to bug out?

[01:51:28.971 --> 01:51:35.734]  Water is the single most important thing your body needs, so you want to be sure it's the best for you and your family.
[01:51:35.734 --> 01:51:39.997]  Since 2005, thousands have depended on Berkey Purified Water.

[01:52:06.610 --> 01:52:10.092]  Something shocking just happened in a Coast Guard unit in San Diego.
[01:52:10.092 --> 01:52:15.514]  The old guys in the unit have turned the tables and are now destroying the young bucks in head-to-head fitness tests.
[01:52:15.514 --> 01:52:17.015]  How is this even possible?
[01:52:17.015 --> 01:52:24.558]  Turns out, the old guys in this unit had been part of a special test group for a doctor-formulated fountain of youth drink called Patriot Power Greens.
[01:52:24.558 --> 01:52:32.201]  Patriot Power Greens has been so effective for many of the older soldiers that it's made their achy joints, stiff muscles, and lack of energy a thing of the past.
[01:52:32.201 --> 01:52:35.403]  Previously, this drink was only available to elite military units.
[01:52:35.683 --> 01:52:43.490]  But for a limited time, the creator of Patriot Power Greens has set aside a small number of free samples specifically for our conservative friends.

[01:53:27.833 --> 01:53:30.895]  My dad was 59 when he collapsed from a heart attack late last year.
[01:53:30.895 --> 01:53:33.516]  Just this past August was when we spread his ashes on the St.
[01:53:33.516 --> 01:53:34.257]  Croix River.
[01:53:34.257 --> 01:53:36.498]  I loved my dad, but boy was he stubborn.
[01:53:36.498 --> 01:53:39.460]  He hadn't been to the doctor in over 25 years.
[01:53:39.460 --> 01:53:40.341]  His excuse?
[01:53:40.341 --> 01:53:41.681]  He simply couldn't afford it.
[01:53:41.681 --> 01:53:43.282]  He wasn't a rich man by any means.
[01:53:43.282 --> 01:53:49.046]  At less than $107 per month, LibertyOnCall.org would have been the perfect alternative for my father.
[01:53:49.046 --> 01:53:50.086]  Don't wait.
[01:53:50.086 --> 01:53:52.728]  Go to LibertyOnCall.org right now.
[01:53:52.728 --> 01:53:55.230]  For not just your sake, but for the sake of your loved ones.

[01:54:14.180 --> 01:54:22.342]  Ladies and gentlemen, the system has used our open form of government to infiltrate with hungry wolves that want to dominate us.
[01:54:22.342 --> 01:54:26.463]  They are attacking every sovereign nation, every sovereign institution that is not pure evil.
[01:54:28.339 --> 01:54:31.822]  They are allied with the scum of the earth.
[01:54:31.822 --> 01:54:36.266]  And quite frankly, people have the right to do whatever they want against this system.
[01:54:36.266 --> 01:54:39.429]  Because it's so lawless, the Declaration of Independence is in place.
[01:54:39.429 --> 01:54:42.792]  But just because you have the right to do something, doesn't mean you should do it.
[01:54:44.341 --> 01:54:54.683]  And people better think long and hard about George Soros and the globalists that are going to laugh while people have shootouts out in the middle of nowhere over land rights issues.
[01:54:54.683 --> 01:55:00.524]  We need to be in the info war, exposing they're coming for our guns, they're flooding us with radical jihadists.
[01:55:00.524 --> 01:55:04.144]  That's what Trump's having success exposing.
[01:55:04.144 --> 01:55:09.805]  For the point that I have Louis Farrakhan on video, we're going to release it very soon.
[01:55:09.805 --> 01:55:13.026]  I'm going to go meet with him again today because we were conferring on when we want to put this out.
[01:55:14.079 --> 01:55:16.061]  Saying, stop all Muslims coming into the U.S.
[01:55:16.061 --> 01:55:19.063]  right now.
[01:55:19.063 --> 01:55:21.285]  It's just over the top.
[01:55:21.285 --> 01:55:23.347]  And that's, Farrakhan's scared.
[01:55:23.347 --> 01:55:23.827]  I'm scared.
[01:55:23.827 --> 01:55:27.310]  I mean, folks, you do not under- I'm telling you, this is so real.
[01:55:27.310 --> 01:55:28.431]  This is so over the top.
[01:55:28.431 --> 01:55:29.432]  This is a setup.
[01:55:29.432 --> 01:55:30.593]  This is how America dies.
[01:55:30.593 --> 01:55:32.695]  This is the takeover.
[01:55:32.695 --> 01:55:37.299]  This is the big war they want to start.
[01:55:37.299 --> 01:55:40.561]  Now, Wayne Madsen, you got cut off by the break.
[01:55:40.561 --> 01:55:41.802]  Looking at this situation,
[01:55:42.990 --> 01:55:47.699]  Obama, I think, really is clearly trying to get people angry to do something stupid.
[01:55:47.699 --> 01:55:52.369]  Do you think they'll get away with a false flag, blaming the patriots like Oklahoma City this time?
[01:55:52.369 --> 01:55:53.591]  What are you most concerned about?
[01:55:53.591 --> 01:55:54.232]  I mean, you've proven...
[01:55:55.333 --> 01:56:02.078]  I'm not kissing your butt here, but it's true that you have piercing understanding of their tricks and how they operate.
[01:56:02.078 --> 01:56:05.561]  I mean, are they doing well right now, or is this all desperate floundering?
[01:56:05.561 --> 01:56:08.443]  Because their poll numbers are all in the toilet, but they don't care.
[01:56:08.443 --> 01:56:10.785]  They're just moving forward with craziness.
[01:56:10.785 --> 01:56:21.673]  And then, you know I'm no lionizer of the feds, but the feds we talk to and what we see leaking, the federal government itself appears to be completely freaked out about what's going on.
[01:56:21.673 --> 01:56:23.974]  It looks like self-preservation may be kicking in here.
[01:56:23.974 --> 01:56:24.335]  Am I wrong?
[01:56:25.200 --> 01:56:29.223]  No, and I think that wiser heads will prevail here.
[01:56:29.223 --> 01:56:37.809]  You know, the government had a lot of egg on its face with Waco, Ruby Ridge, and of course that happened under whose administration?
[01:56:37.809 --> 01:56:40.291]  We have to remember that was Mr. Clinton.
[01:56:40.291 --> 01:56:42.012]  His wife's running for president.
[01:56:42.012 --> 01:56:45.635]  She's a lot closer, by the way, to Soros than even Obama is.
[01:56:46.635 --> 01:56:59.946]  Uh, so I think, I think there's going to be an attempt to tamp this one down because if there's another situation where there's a lot of bloodshed, uh, you know, it's, it's Katie, bar the door, all bets are off.
[01:56:59.946 --> 01:57:04.930]  And this is why, you know, I think the Trump phenomenon here is very interesting.
[01:57:04.930 --> 01:57:05.311]  And I think.
[01:57:06.592 --> 01:57:10.834]  The sleeper issue here is generally what he's talking about.
[01:57:10.834 --> 01:57:13.136]  There's too much political correctness.
[01:57:13.136 --> 01:57:18.840]  Which gets into a wider issue of people trying to control public discourse.
[01:57:18.840 --> 01:57:28.466]  I recently noted that my mom's family, going back generations, helped start the annual New Year's Mummers Parade in Philadelphia.
[01:57:28.466 --> 01:57:30.968]  Well, a guy just got suspended because he had a sign
[01:57:31.768 --> 01:57:36.293]  In the comic division, and they always made fun of everything.
[01:57:36.293 --> 01:57:41.638]  I remember seeing that when I was a kid, the Mummer's Braid would make fun of all kinds of things.
[01:57:41.638 --> 01:57:48.925]  He had a picture of Bruce Jenner from the old Wheaties box when he was an Olympic star.
[01:57:48.925 --> 01:57:53.209]  And then they had a picture of Caitlyn Jenner on a box of Froot Loops.
[01:57:53.689 --> 01:57:57.573]  Yeah, so even having fun now is illegal.
[01:57:57.573 --> 01:58:00.595]  I mean, it's just exactly, free speech, big deal.
[01:58:00.595 --> 01:58:05.260]  Yeah, so now this guy's been banned for life from the Mummers Parade.
[01:58:05.260 --> 01:58:09.924]  His family probably also probably helped start it going back generations.
[01:58:09.924 --> 01:58:18.011]  And now the Mummers, even the spring band divisions have to undergo LGBT, BLT, whatever it's called, sensitivity training.
[01:58:18.812 --> 01:58:24.154]  You know, you take that, and there was a liberal arts school in Pennsylvania, and the hall was full.
[01:58:24.154 --> 01:58:25.795]  Banning, banning the lynch.
[01:58:25.795 --> 01:58:26.896]  Stay there, I'm going to come back.
[01:58:26.896 --> 01:58:28.076]  Wait, wait, wait, stay there.
[01:58:28.076 --> 01:58:29.037]  We're back in 70 seconds.
[01:58:29.037 --> 01:58:30.757]  We'll come right back to you.
[01:58:30.757 --> 01:58:34.619]  And we're also going to get to clips from Obama's gun grab speech that happened hours ago.
[01:58:34.619 --> 01:58:36.040]  We got five clips of that.
[01:58:36.040 --> 01:58:39.681]  The third hour straight ahead.
[01:58:39.681 --> 01:58:41.122]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[01:58:49.088 --> 01:58:58.113]  Every year, millions of Americans are unknowingly letting government institutions and megacorporations steal billions of dollars of their money.

[02:00:00.502 --> 02:00:03.623]  They took my saddle in Houston.
[02:00:03.623 --> 02:00:08.664]  Broke my leg in Santa Fe.
[02:00:08.664 --> 02:00:10.965]  Lost my wife and a girlfriend.
[02:00:14.571 --> 02:00:17.775]  In defense of human liberty, Alex Jones.
[02:00:25.276 --> 02:00:29.118]  Wayne Madsen, WayneMadsenReport.com and FolkWarriors.com reporter got cut off by the break.
[02:00:29.118 --> 02:00:33.519]  We're going to come up in the next segment and play five clips from Obama's gun grab.
[02:00:33.519 --> 02:00:38.701]  Wayne, you got cut off getting into hardcore control of speech in America.
[02:00:38.701 --> 02:00:46.184]  We've only really seen under Pol Pot's Khmer Rouge in Cambodia, maybe the Nazis, the Soviets, the Maoists.
[02:00:46.184 --> 02:00:52.727]  I mean, this is flaming tyranny, flaming beyond a cult, the control of language.
[02:00:53.937 --> 02:00:58.780]  And then they've got so many followers that actually get off on conforming.
[02:00:58.780 --> 02:01:19.675]  Yeah, and we had yet another case recently at Oberlin, which is a very liberal school in Ohio, where some of the students, again, mostly affluenza, self-entitled rich white kids, were objecting to the fact that they were serving General Tso's chicken and it wasn't made according to the Chinese way.
[02:01:19.675 --> 02:01:21.236]  Well, General Tso's chicken
[02:01:21.596 --> 02:01:22.876]  Never came from China.
[02:01:22.876 --> 02:01:27.977]  It was a contrivance made up by Chinese restaurants in the United States.
[02:01:27.977 --> 02:01:35.839]  So not only these people being fascists when it comes to free speech, they're stupid as well.
[02:01:35.839 --> 02:01:44.100]  What happened in Pennsylvania with the Lynch Hall, named after a former president of that school named Lynch.
[02:01:44.100 --> 02:01:45.200]  It was a benefactor.
[02:01:45.200 --> 02:01:47.421]  They saw that means like lynching.
[02:01:47.421 --> 02:01:47.861]  These are
[02:01:49.401 --> 02:01:53.905]  Is the Attorney General going to change her name?
[02:01:53.905 --> 02:01:55.907]  Is her Irish name evil?
[02:01:55.907 --> 02:01:56.628]  Right, right.
[02:01:56.628 --> 02:01:57.308]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:01:57.308 --> 02:02:00.251]  How about getting rid of the TV show, The Jeffersons?
[02:02:00.251 --> 02:02:03.594]  A lot of people want to get Jefferson's name because he was a slave owner.
[02:02:03.594 --> 02:02:04.675]  They want to get it off of things.
[02:02:05.195 --> 02:02:06.958]  Even though he was trying to end slavery.
[02:02:06.958 --> 02:02:18.992]  Yeah, but they started with this Civil War thing and I had a real bad feeling that that was not going to stop with a couple of statues and a couple of Confederate flags that it was going to continue.
[02:02:18.992 --> 02:02:21.595]  And by the way, I want to say this about Jefferson.
[02:02:22.532 --> 02:02:26.213]  Jefferson inherited people that were part of his family.
[02:02:26.213 --> 02:02:29.533]  I say slavery didn't even exist because they were still people to begin with.
[02:02:29.533 --> 02:02:31.374]  I'm not a slave even if you say I am.
[02:02:31.374 --> 02:02:33.274]  And he had children.
[02:02:33.274 --> 02:02:34.634]  They say he was raping these women.
[02:02:34.634 --> 02:02:35.594]  They loved him.
[02:02:35.594 --> 02:02:39.715]  He actually, I'd say, went native and became basically the first black president.
[02:02:39.715 --> 02:02:40.855]  Loved black people.
[02:02:40.855 --> 02:02:46.216]  Tried to end slavery and they wouldn't let him do it in the first Declaration of Independence and the Constitution.
[02:02:46.216 --> 02:02:49.417]  So they demonized the first guy that tried to really end it.
[02:02:50.057 --> 02:02:57.682]  And he said slavery is a great evil and will come back on us, and then they sit there and lie to people and say Thomas Jefferson hated black people!
[02:02:57.682 --> 02:03:06.048]  Right, and I think there is an active measure, and it's funded a lot by these, not just Soros, there's a lot of people like Soros.
[02:03:06.048 --> 02:03:18.477]  He's got a lot of money, he's got a lot of exposure, but there is an attempt to reinvent history, and we saw that in the old Soviet Union, we saw that in Nazi Germany, how they tried to reinvent their own past, and I see that happening now.
[02:03:18.877 --> 02:03:25.299]  Hillary, for example, a couple weeks ago actually attacked a comedy club because they were making fun of her.
[02:03:25.299 --> 02:03:28.259]  Okay, is this what we're going to look forward to?
[02:03:28.259 --> 02:03:38.222]  And now, you know, that means, that means we've had a couple of comedians already complain about this and they start to sound a lot like
[02:03:40.163 --> 02:03:43.866]  A lot like Trump when it comes to this political correctness.
[02:03:43.866 --> 02:03:51.734]  I think this is a sleeper issue because when people feel like they're not, they don't have the right to say what they want to say.
[02:03:51.734 --> 02:03:55.137]  I mean it started with workplace being politically correct.
[02:03:55.137 --> 02:03:55.877]  I agree.
[02:03:55.877 --> 02:03:56.778]  People are pissed.
[02:03:56.778 --> 02:03:57.459]  They're tired of it.
[02:03:57.984 --> 02:04:14.704]  Absolutely, and I think it's an issue that is giving Trump this continued bounce in the Democratic... I want to talk Trump when we come back and also get David Knight to pop in here and play these clips from Obama, but separately.
[02:04:15.708 --> 02:04:20.951]  When I make the America's First Black President comment, Clintons are known to be racist.
[02:04:20.951 --> 02:04:23.052]  Clintons have no connection to black people.
[02:04:23.052 --> 02:04:25.593]  He puts some office he goes to once a year in Harlem.
[02:04:25.593 --> 02:04:27.574]  They claim he's the first black president.
[02:04:27.574 --> 02:04:32.677]  Thomas Jefferson had children with black women and preferred black people's company to whites at his home.
[02:04:32.677 --> 02:04:33.878]  That's well known.
[02:04:33.878 --> 02:04:35.298]  On record, he wrote about it.
[02:04:35.298 --> 02:04:39.961]  So if you want to say a white guy is the first black president, it's the third president of the United States.
[02:04:39.961 --> 02:04:40.962]  It's not Bill Clinton.
[02:04:40.962 --> 02:04:43.423]  I mean, doesn't Thomas Jefferson have a better claim than Bill Clinton?
[02:04:44.901 --> 02:04:47.883]  Oh, I think so.
[02:04:47.883 --> 02:04:51.525]  I mean, is Clinton having children with black women?
[02:04:51.525 --> 02:04:56.749]  Well, there was a story about Arkansas... So maybe he is like Thomas Jefferson.
[02:04:56.749 --> 02:04:59.110]  We'll be right back, folks.
[02:04:59.110 --> 02:05:11.418]  While President Obama attempts to enact gun control via executive action, a new Gallup poll shows that only 2% of Americans believe that guns or gun control are among the country's top problems.
[02:05:11.818 --> 02:05:18.882]  Gallup asked about 1,000 Americans in all 50 states what they thought the nation's top problems were in 2015.
[02:05:18.882 --> 02:05:25.506]  And out of 23 problems mentioned by Americans, guns, gun control, ranked near the bottom at 19th.
[02:05:25.506 --> 02:05:36.593]  In comparison, 16% of Americans said that the government was the nation's biggest issue, 13% said the economy, 8% said unemployment, and another 8% said immigration.
[02:05:37.133 --> 02:05:45.062]  But rather than working on these hot button issues, both President Obama and the mainstream media would rather focus on gun control.
[02:05:45.062 --> 02:05:52.551]  With the President even stating that he wants to, quote, make gun control part of his legacy, end quote, according to CNN.

[02:06:02.308 --> 02:06:10.574]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.

[02:06:56.421 --> 02:07:00.624]  It has happened.
[02:07:00.624 --> 02:07:03.667]  2015 has passed into history, into lore.
[02:07:03.667 --> 02:07:06.990]  But now, 2016 has been born.
[02:07:06.990 --> 02:07:10.673]  And the decision lies in your hands to forge the destiny.
[02:07:12.014 --> 02:07:13.035]  Whoa, whoa, whoa!
[02:07:13.035 --> 02:07:17.638]  That's a little too epic, that Hollywood action-adventure-science-fiction voice I'm using.
[02:07:17.638 --> 02:07:26.223]  But quite frankly, that's how I feel like I should be talking about what happens when your body actually gets the real, natural nutrients it needs.

[02:07:51.907 --> 02:07:52.828]  I just did it again.
[02:07:52.828 --> 02:07:54.310]  I can't help but get excited.
[02:07:54.310 --> 02:07:55.151]  Get healthy!
[02:07:55.151 --> 02:07:56.193]  Fight the globalists!
[02:07:56.193 --> 02:07:56.794]  Win-win!
[02:07:56.794 --> 02:07:57.034]  Yeah!
[02:08:00.752 --> 02:08:01.812]  Stalin took the guns.
[02:08:01.812 --> 02:08:02.973]  Mao took the guns.
[02:08:02.973 --> 02:08:04.653]  Fidel Castro took the guns.
[02:08:04.653 --> 02:08:05.873]  Hugo Chavez took the guns.
[02:08:05.873 --> 02:08:11.395]  And I'm here to tell you, 1776 will commence again if you try to take our firearms.
[02:08:11.395 --> 02:08:15.976]  It doesn't matter how many lemmings you get out there on the street begging for them to have their guns taken.
[02:08:15.976 --> 02:08:17.497]  We will not relinquish them.
[02:08:17.497 --> 02:08:18.397]  Do you understand?
[02:08:18.397 --> 02:08:24.639]  Rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty.
[02:08:24.639 --> 02:08:26.119]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:08:29.355 --> 02:08:48.031]  If you believe in the right to self-defense, if you believe in the right to be parents, if you believe in the right to private property, if you believe in the right to travel within your own nation, if you believe in fellow humans and are a fan of humanity, then you are my brother and my sister in arms.
[02:08:48.031 --> 02:08:53.856]  If you believe you're God and everybody else is scum and you're going to transcend humanity and humanity's trash, you're my enemy.
[02:08:56.462 --> 02:08:58.083]  That's what separates this world.
[02:08:58.083 --> 02:09:03.265]  Those of goodwill, those of badwill.
[02:09:03.265 --> 02:09:07.167]  And the world is hurtling towards a crisis.
[02:09:07.167 --> 02:09:10.469]  The elite are cutting off the resources, claiming they're saving the planet.
[02:09:10.469 --> 02:09:13.591]  Whether they are or not, they have a hatred.
[02:09:13.591 --> 02:09:17.793]  Wayne Madsen, investigative journalist, former NSA officer, is our guest.
[02:09:17.793 --> 02:09:20.974]  Engineer, reporter, riding shotgun as I'm here on the road.
[02:09:20.974 --> 02:09:24.036]  David Knight will be hosting himself the fourth hour today.
[02:09:25.230 --> 02:09:28.691]  Was I prepared to travel back to Austin?
[02:09:28.691 --> 02:09:30.791]  David Knight is with us.
[02:09:30.791 --> 02:09:37.752]  I wanted to briefly bring David Knight and then give him a break until Joe Biggs comes up and I'm sure he'll have some comments for that at the bottom of the hour.
[02:09:37.752 --> 02:09:44.293]  Then I want to get to these other clips, but here is a clip from Harry Reid.
[02:09:44.293 --> 02:09:46.414]  I want to get Wayne's take on this as well.
[02:09:46.414 --> 02:09:54.415]  Obviously after David Knight and others marching up, David wasn't armed, the Fed said we're going to shoot you if you cross the line to take the Bundy's cattle back.
[02:09:55.745 --> 02:09:56.646]  And it's incredible footage.
[02:09:56.646 --> 02:10:00.408]  I think the headline is historic footage.
[02:10:00.408 --> 02:10:02.289]  Feds surrender to citizens.
[02:10:02.289 --> 02:10:06.772]  And they lower their guns and don't do it because they're special ops people that Feds actually brought in.
[02:10:06.772 --> 02:10:12.016]  They're like, I'm not going to shoot Americans waving American flags with cowboy hats on over cattle we just stole from them.
[02:10:12.016 --> 02:10:14.697]  I mean, so they're not our enemies is my point.
[02:10:14.697 --> 02:10:17.099]  If a shooting war starts, that's the way it is.
[02:10:17.099 --> 02:10:22.282]  But I mean, we're really losers if we let this happen.
[02:10:22.282 --> 02:10:23.303]  And then I just question
[02:10:26.374 --> 02:10:34.456]  The kind of black hole that is people just showing up claiming that they speak for everybody and running around claiming that I'm saying the Bundys are feds when I'm not.
[02:10:34.456 --> 02:10:37.397]  Boy, isn't that funny how that works.
[02:10:37.397 --> 02:10:43.298]  People speak for you and MSNBC says I'm deeply racist too.
[02:10:43.298 --> 02:10:45.379]  And that giant wasp lives under the UN building.
[02:10:45.379 --> 02:10:47.019]  It's not true, folks.
[02:10:47.019 --> 02:10:49.580]  This is the disinfo going on, but here's that clip.
[02:10:49.580 --> 02:10:50.860]  We'll get David's take on that.
[02:10:50.860 --> 02:10:52.441]  Here it is.
[02:10:52.441 --> 02:10:53.801]  Keep in mind what happened up there.
[02:10:55.478 --> 02:11:01.279]  There were hundreds, hundreds of people from around the country that came there.
[02:11:01.279 --> 02:11:04.720]  They had sniper rifles on the freeway.
[02:11:04.720 --> 02:11:06.200]  They had assault weapons.
[02:11:06.200 --> 02:11:07.780]  They had automatic weapons.
[02:11:07.780 --> 02:11:19.822]  And as one of the former sheriffs from Arizona said, and we had children and women lined up because if anyone got hurt, we wanted to make sure they got hurt first because we wanted the federal government hurting women and children.
[02:11:19.822 --> 02:11:22.183]  This is the deal and it's not a good one.
[02:11:22.183 --> 02:11:24.683]  So these people who hold themselves out
[02:11:25.606 --> 02:11:27.727]  To be patriots, or not.
[02:11:27.727 --> 02:11:30.609]  They're nothing more than domestic terrorists.
[02:11:30.609 --> 02:11:34.471]  And I think that we are a country that people should follow the law.
[02:11:34.471 --> 02:11:37.333]  And what went up in Mesquite is not very good.
[02:11:37.333 --> 02:11:39.574]  I repeat, what went up there is domestic terrorism.
[02:11:39.574 --> 02:11:41.536]  And again, I told David to take a break until he came back.
[02:11:41.536 --> 02:11:43.677]  He's already out of the studio, so we'll get his take on this later.
[02:11:43.677 --> 02:11:53.143]  But here's CNN, then, yesterday, calling the three Bundy sons and the people there in Oregon, who've just taken over this federal
[02:11:54.292 --> 02:12:01.773]  Little warehouse, little barn that nobody's in, and are wanting to draw attention to what's happening in the cause.
[02:12:01.773 --> 02:12:06.014]  And I know the Bundys prayed and folks were ready to die back at their ranch.
[02:12:06.014 --> 02:12:08.374]  Well, now they're here, I guess, ready to do that.
[02:12:08.374 --> 02:12:10.035]  And I'm just saying, this is really bad timing.
[02:12:10.035 --> 02:12:10.495]  And you know what?
[02:12:10.495 --> 02:12:10.995]  It's America.
[02:12:10.995 --> 02:12:13.275]  I got my First Amendment.
[02:12:13.275 --> 02:12:15.856]  And I said, watch out for feds, the infiltrator, pull something.
[02:12:15.856 --> 02:12:17.316]  Which is a no-brainer.
[02:12:17.316 --> 02:12:18.696]  Like the sun coming up.
[02:12:18.696 --> 02:12:22.237]  And boy, people said, Alex is saying the Bundys are feds.
[02:12:22.237 --> 02:12:22.637]  Oh, really?
[02:12:22.637 --> 02:12:23.357]  Produce that clip.
[02:12:24.215 --> 02:12:26.416]  Oh, but don't suspect who makes stuff up.
[02:12:26.416 --> 02:12:28.077]  Don't suspect who does that.
[02:12:28.077 --> 02:12:30.718]  Tries to cut you off from the main patriot leader support.
[02:12:30.718 --> 02:12:31.599]  Oh, don't.
[02:12:31.599 --> 02:12:33.900]  Oh, no, don't, don't, don't question that, of course.
[02:12:33.900 --> 02:12:36.021]  Oh, no.
[02:12:36.021 --> 02:12:38.062]  If we're this stupid, we deserve what happens to us.
[02:12:39.346 --> 02:12:41.708]  Wayne Madsen, again, getting back into this briefly.
[02:12:41.708 --> 02:12:42.929]  They want civil unrest.
[02:12:42.929 --> 02:12:44.831]  They're funding the Black Lives Matter movement.
[02:12:44.831 --> 02:12:48.995]  It has a lot of legitimate beefs, but their answer is federalized police.
[02:12:48.995 --> 02:12:57.143]  They're bringing in these new UN nodes under a strong city initiative to basically federalize everything.
[02:12:57.143 --> 02:13:00.186]  I mean, boy, I tell you, this is quite a constellation of tyranny we're witnessing.
[02:13:01.331 --> 02:13:04.474]  Yeah, it's always interesting to hear Harry Reid.
[02:13:04.474 --> 02:13:08.218]  You know, Harry Reid is a product of the Las Vegas mob.
[02:13:08.218 --> 02:13:18.249]  Here's a guy, and if people think that he almost put his eye out because of a malfunctioning exercise machine, you know, I've got a bridge in Brooklyn to sell him.
[02:13:18.249 --> 02:13:18.830]  This guy got
[02:13:19.130 --> 02:13:28.862]  Got like a $25 million markup set aside to take the old Federal Post Office building in Vegas and turn it into a mob museum.
[02:13:28.862 --> 02:13:33.648]  Can you imagine a museum honoring the Mafia, Bonesy Siegel and Meyer Lansky?
[02:13:35.330 --> 02:13:42.494]  We know who's been buttering Harry Reid's bread for years.
[02:13:42.494 --> 02:13:44.515]  It's Nevada, of course.
[02:13:44.515 --> 02:13:48.797]  It's a wide-open state, but you get what you pay for.
[02:13:48.797 --> 02:13:51.539]  People paid for Harry Reid and they got what they expected.
[02:13:51.539 --> 02:13:55.781]  They got a mobbed-up senator to help run a mobbed-up state.
[02:13:57.372 --> 02:14:01.062]  And people finally said no to him, which we admire.
[02:14:01.062 --> 02:14:04.972]  What is the word from your investigative repertoire of what really happened to Reid?
[02:14:06.673 --> 02:14:18.175]  Well, I talked to people, and you know, of course this happened while he was out in Nevada, that he may have gotten into a big fist fight with somebody.
[02:14:18.175 --> 02:14:19.915]  Somebody sent him a message.
[02:14:19.915 --> 02:14:22.896]  He didn't have the right answer, as we used to say.
[02:14:22.896 --> 02:14:25.116]  Somebody didn't have the right answer up in Philadelphia.
[02:14:25.116 --> 02:14:27.077]  You know, they got a black guy.
[02:14:27.077 --> 02:14:30.797]  And I think that's probably what happened.
[02:14:30.797 --> 02:14:33.278]  I think the guy's so mobbed up, he got a little
[02:14:33.858 --> 02:14:39.283]  Like Donnie Brasco action going on there.
[02:14:39.283 --> 02:14:41.004]  What was the word on Bush?
[02:14:41.004 --> 02:14:43.726]  Obviously he kept falling down and getting all beaten up.
[02:14:43.726 --> 02:14:45.588]  He claimed he choked on a pretzel.
[02:14:45.588 --> 02:14:47.990]  That's interesting, the pretzel thing.
[02:14:47.990 --> 02:14:53.614]  I had that confirmed later by somebody pretty high up in government.
[02:14:53.614 --> 02:14:55.395]  He actually was drunk.
[02:14:55.395 --> 02:14:56.797]  He was watching a football game.
[02:14:56.797 --> 02:15:01.861]  He was drinking Jim Beam and chasing it with Lone Star beer.
[02:15:02.581 --> 02:15:06.042]  Now there's a guy that wasn't supposed to be drinking anymore, you know, recovering alcohol.
[02:15:06.042 --> 02:15:08.683]  And why is he drinking crap beer and drinking crap whiskey?
[02:15:08.683 --> 02:15:13.404]  I mean, with all that money, he ought to be drinking... Anyway, sorry, go ahead.
[02:15:13.404 --> 02:15:13.984]  He liked it.
[02:15:13.984 --> 02:15:21.306]  It was, I guess, something he had been doing his whole life or, you know, he and his buddies used to do it when they were in the fraternity.
[02:15:21.306 --> 02:15:28.908]  But yeah, when he passed out, he hit the coffee table in the residential quarters of the White House.
[02:15:28.908 --> 02:15:30.189]  Probably not the first time.
[02:15:31.129 --> 02:15:34.811]  We had Bill Clinton used to walk out with marks on his forehead.
[02:15:34.811 --> 02:15:36.872]  Then one time he said he walked into a door.
[02:15:36.872 --> 02:15:40.954]  Actually, he walked into an ashtray that had been thrown at him by Hillary Clinton.
[02:15:40.954 --> 02:15:45.256]  I got that from Secret Service agents, Presidential Security.
[02:15:45.256 --> 02:15:46.837]  Let me raise this.
[02:15:46.837 --> 02:15:49.278]  Obviously, you've got a lot of Secret Service connections and stuff.
[02:15:49.278 --> 02:15:52.200]  I think they're persecuting him because they know how close they are to the President.
[02:15:52.200 --> 02:15:53.240]  Obviously, no agency is perfect.
[02:15:55.445 --> 02:15:59.266]  One drunk driving deal, some hookers, I mean big deal compared to other agencies.
[02:15:59.266 --> 02:16:05.448]  I think getting from high level sources that Obama is just whacked out beyond belief and is actually, I mean we talked about earlier practicing Muslim.
[02:16:05.448 --> 02:16:07.409]  Do you have any intel on that?
[02:16:07.409 --> 02:16:17.412]  Well, what I understand is, and I think the biggest problem with Secret Service is when they made him part of Homeland Security, they should have left him separate as part of the Treasury Department.
[02:16:17.412 --> 02:16:19.912]  Because there was always that esprit de corps.
[02:16:19.912 --> 02:16:21.633]  Now they're like part of that big
[02:16:22.433 --> 02:16:26.535]  You know, American version of the KGB, a huge bureaucracy.
[02:16:26.535 --> 02:16:36.161]  But what I've heard is that Obama is incredibly disengaged from a lot of day-to-day events.
[02:16:36.161 --> 02:16:50.008]  When he does get on the internet or uses his classified, secure BlackBerry, he's doing a lot of vanity searches to see what people are saying about him, how the press is covering him.
[02:16:50.008 --> 02:16:50.729]  But other than that,
[02:16:51.209 --> 02:17:02.159]  I understand ESPN is found on TV more often in the private quarters of the White House than, you know, CNN or MSNBC.
[02:17:02.159 --> 02:17:03.200]  Well, he admits that.
[02:17:03.200 --> 02:17:08.665]  I mean, what about him, like, being on reality TV shows and saying, I'm going to watch Star Wars this weekend?
[02:17:08.665 --> 02:17:10.687]  I mean, while all these wars are going on?
[02:17:10.687 --> 02:17:11.568]  I mean, even liberals.
[02:17:12.128 --> 02:17:15.509]  Like David Spader coming out and saying, hey, you need to be on reality TV a little bit less.
[02:17:15.509 --> 02:17:16.529]  We got five clips here.
[02:17:16.529 --> 02:17:17.409]  I want to start going to them.
[02:17:17.409 --> 02:17:22.150]  I didn't get the list, guys, so I'll just go to the first clip.
[02:17:22.150 --> 02:17:26.871]  Let's play this first clip from Obama's press conference earlier where he fake cried.
[02:17:26.871 --> 02:17:29.792]  I mean, talk about going all out to get our guns.
[02:17:29.792 --> 02:17:36.533]  That's trying to mobilize the hordes of his disenfranchised idiot supporters to help complete our journey to slavery.
[02:17:36.533 --> 02:17:36.833]  Here it is.
[02:17:38.112 --> 02:17:58.022]  Anybody in the business of selling firearms must get a license and conduct background checks or be subject to criminal prosecutions.
[02:17:58.022 --> 02:17:59.242]  That means transferring guns to your family.
[02:17:59.242 --> 02:18:02.524]  It doesn't matter whether you're doing it over the internet or at a gun show.
[02:18:02.524 --> 02:18:04.805]  National registration.
[02:18:04.805 --> 02:18:06.546]  It's not where you do it, but what you do.
[02:18:08.001 --> 02:18:08.841]  How are you doing?
[02:18:08.841 --> 02:18:10.982]  What did you do?
[02:18:10.982 --> 02:18:13.163]  Okay, so that's the National Registration Database.
[02:18:13.163 --> 02:18:15.043]  That's the next step to taking our guns.
[02:18:15.043 --> 02:18:15.884]  They admit it.
[02:18:15.884 --> 02:18:20.265]  We have the Austin Pro-Team Mayor saying once we register, we confiscate and laughing.
[02:18:20.265 --> 02:18:21.986]  I mean, they tell us they're coming.
[02:18:21.986 --> 02:18:22.686]  Period.
[02:18:22.686 --> 02:18:24.987]  This is the guy with Secret Service Guardian.
[02:18:24.987 --> 02:18:26.487]  Let's go ahead and go to the next clip.
[02:18:26.487 --> 02:18:29.048]  This is expanding background checks.
[02:18:29.048 --> 02:18:32.209]  That means putting psychological, BS, no-fly list.
[02:18:32.209 --> 02:18:33.149]  Just made-up crap.
[02:18:33.149 --> 02:18:33.970]  No judge, no jury.
[02:18:33.970 --> 02:18:34.270]  Here it is.
[02:18:36.172 --> 02:18:44.778]  We're also expanding background checks to cover violent criminals who try to buy some of the most dangerous firearms by hiding behind trusts and corporations.
[02:18:44.778 --> 02:18:46.320]  Unless there's Syrian refugees.
[02:18:47.403 --> 02:18:48.664]  You can't buy through trust.
[02:18:48.664 --> 02:18:50.004]  If you buy the gun, then put it to trust.
[02:18:50.004 --> 02:18:54.306]  We're also taking steps to make the background check system more efficient.
[02:18:54.306 --> 02:18:56.668]  Like the thousands of Syrian refugees you just let go.
[02:18:56.668 --> 02:18:58.508]  Jim Comey and the FBI.
[02:18:58.508 --> 02:19:01.590]  Or the air flight with 150 people from Mexico you just let go through customs.
[02:19:01.590 --> 02:19:05.852]  ATF, you drug addict.
[02:19:05.852 --> 02:19:08.553]  We're going to hire more folks to process applications faster.
[02:19:08.553 --> 02:19:09.294]  What a weirdo.
[02:19:09.294 --> 02:19:10.955]  I don't care he goes to gay bathhouses.
[02:19:10.955 --> 02:19:13.176]  I don't care he's a drug addict and uses cocaine in Mexico.
[02:19:14.116 --> 02:19:16.457]  But then he's a radical Muslim on top of it?
[02:19:16.457 --> 02:19:18.038]  Will they chop your head off for that?
[02:19:18.038 --> 02:19:20.179]  What a freak!
[02:19:20.179 --> 02:19:24.802]  He's got like tranny nannies when he's a kid and he wants to chop heads off?
[02:19:24.802 --> 02:19:26.482]  I mean, he's just a freak!
[02:19:26.482 --> 02:19:28.243]  I'm sorry folks, I'm flipping out.
[02:19:28.243 --> 02:19:28.904]  Wayne, we're going to break.
[02:19:28.904 --> 02:19:30.064]  We're going to come back with more of these clips.
[02:19:30.064 --> 02:19:32.365]  But what do you make of this big gun grab?
[02:19:32.365 --> 02:19:38.008]  Well, you know, anytime the government says we're here to help you, you know, watch out.
[02:19:38.008 --> 02:19:41.250]  Especially big programs like he's doing through Executive Order.
[02:19:43.453 --> 02:19:46.056]  I want to see where you think this is all going straight ahead, Wayne.
[02:19:46.056 --> 02:19:47.818]  Final segment, WayneMadsenReport.com.

[02:21:24.295 --> 02:21:26.637]  My name is Jonathan Wright, and I'm 40 years old.
[02:21:26.637 --> 02:21:29.480]  I recently went from a desk job to a manual labor job.
[02:21:29.480 --> 02:21:30.601]  Normally, I'm worn out.
[02:21:30.601 --> 02:21:36.406]  With Energy Enhanced One World Way, I now recover so quickly that I can perform very hard work all day long.
[02:21:36.406 --> 02:21:41.771]  I use Energy Enhanced One World Way for breakfast and lunch, and I experience less hunger throughout the day.
[02:21:41.771 --> 02:21:44.894]  I have a 30% increase in energy, and I just feel better.
[02:21:44.894 --> 02:21:48.117]  I plan to make Energy Enhanced One World Way a permanent part of my lifestyle.

[02:22:06.914 --> 02:22:10.416]  Something shocking just happened in a Coast Guard unit in San Diego.
[02:22:10.416 --> 02:22:15.838]  The old guys in the unit have turned the tables and are now destroying the young bucks in head-to-head fitness tests.
[02:22:15.838 --> 02:22:17.339]  How is this even possible?
[02:22:17.339 --> 02:22:24.882]  Turns out, the old guys in this unit have been part of a special test group for a doctor-formulated fountain of youth drink called Patriot Power Greens.
[02:22:24.882 --> 02:22:32.525]  Patriot Power Greens has been so effective for many of the older soldiers that it's made their achy joints, stiff muscles, and lack of energy a thing of the past.
[02:22:32.525 --> 02:22:35.727]  Previously, this drink was only available to elite military units.
[02:22:36.007 --> 02:22:43.815]  But for a limited time, the creator of Patriot Power Greens has set aside a small number of free samples specifically for our conservative friends.
[02:22:43.815 --> 02:22:46.978]  All they ask is that you chip in a few bucks to cover shipping.

[02:24:10.097 --> 02:24:12.177]  Ladies and gentlemen, Alex Jones here.
[02:24:12.177 --> 02:24:15.298]  So let's walk through the cliffs here.
[02:24:15.298 --> 02:24:17.239]  Anyone selling a firearm must get a license.
[02:24:17.239 --> 02:24:18.279]  That means transferring.
[02:24:18.279 --> 02:24:20.439]  That means giving a .22 to your grandson.
[02:24:20.439 --> 02:24:26.761]  That's to track all guns, make it felonies, start investigations claiming guns were transferred wrong.
[02:24:26.761 --> 02:24:31.002]  It's a license to harass the daylights out of the Second Amendment and register them nationally.
[02:24:31.002 --> 02:24:32.362]  Katie, bar the door.
[02:24:32.362 --> 02:24:34.483]  Massive assault we thought would come months later.
[02:24:34.483 --> 02:24:37.503]  Because the big assault is that it's executive orders outside of law.
[02:24:37.503 --> 02:24:38.244]  Never forget that.
[02:24:38.244 --> 02:24:39.464]  It's all completely illegal.
[02:24:40.785 --> 02:24:42.066]  Expound background checks.
[02:24:42.066 --> 02:24:46.830]  That means put in more stuff not in the Gun Control Act or not in the next Brady Bill.
[02:24:46.830 --> 02:24:48.791]  It's even been overturned, but they don't care.
[02:24:48.791 --> 02:24:51.153]  They just keep doing it.
[02:24:51.153 --> 02:24:55.717]  They're just going to come after the guns by adding psychologicals, you name it.
[02:24:55.717 --> 02:24:56.618]  No fly list.
[02:24:56.618 --> 02:24:58.159]  No one knows why you're on it.
[02:24:58.159 --> 02:24:59.700]  Members of Congress are on it.
[02:24:59.700 --> 02:25:00.741]  Members of Homeland Security.
[02:25:00.741 --> 02:25:01.842]  You just can't have a gun.
[02:25:03.186 --> 02:25:04.907]  Boost gun safety technology.
[02:25:04.907 --> 02:25:16.871]  That's how Smith & Wesson and everybody else, basically, is leaving California with micro-stamping on each cap when you fire it on 20-foot drop tests.
[02:25:16.871 --> 02:25:19.652]  It's just all this stuff to ban guns with regulations.
[02:25:19.652 --> 02:25:22.593]  Outside of law, more criminal activity.
[02:25:22.593 --> 02:25:27.674]  And then, of course, we are the only advanced country on earth with frequent violent gun crimes.
[02:25:27.674 --> 02:25:28.315]  Totally false.
[02:25:28.315 --> 02:25:28.815]  Total lie.
[02:25:29.807 --> 02:25:32.568]  Gun crime has dropped 60 plus percent in the last 20 years.
[02:25:32.568 --> 02:25:34.228]  And then we've got Obama's crime moment.
[02:25:34.228 --> 02:25:36.349]  Let's go to boost gun safety.
[02:25:36.349 --> 02:25:43.611]  That means sabotage and have outside of law regulations to shut down gun manufacturers and render your gun you own at home illegal.
[02:25:43.611 --> 02:25:47.292]  First they make new ones have the micro stamp and all this other stuff, then they ban the others.
[02:25:47.292 --> 02:25:48.592]  That's been done in other countries.
[02:25:48.592 --> 02:25:52.834]  They're following an enemy blueprint that's been successful.
[02:25:52.834 --> 02:25:54.234]  But again, we have the enemy blueprint.
[02:25:54.234 --> 02:25:55.554]  Here it is.
[02:25:55.554 --> 02:25:57.215]  We're going to boost gun safety technology.
[02:25:58.516 --> 02:26:06.160]  Now today, many gun injuries and deaths are the result of legal guns that were stolen, or misused, or discharged accidentally.
[02:26:06.160 --> 02:26:12.983]  In 2013 alone, more than 500 people lost their lives to gun accidents, and that includes 30 children younger than 5 years old.
[02:26:12.983 --> 02:26:15.344]  So now they're going to be biometric and not work?
[02:26:15.344 --> 02:26:19.046]  In the greatest, most technologically advanced nation on earth, there is
[02:26:20.140 --> 02:26:21.700]  No reason for this.
[02:26:21.700 --> 02:26:26.422]  So this is smart grid, where they technologically bring in the gun culture.
[02:26:26.422 --> 02:26:31.823]  Set it up so you can't unlock your phone unless you got the right fingerprint.
[02:26:31.823 --> 02:26:32.604]  See, it's smart grid.
[02:26:32.604 --> 02:26:34.224]  Your car, your phone, your gun.
[02:26:34.224 --> 02:26:34.764]  Everything controlled.
[02:26:34.764 --> 02:26:36.785]  Why can't we do the same thing for our guns?
[02:26:36.785 --> 02:26:39.266]  Smart guns, which means third phones.
[02:26:39.266 --> 02:26:39.726]  Alright, that's enough.
[02:26:39.726 --> 02:26:41.406]  Let's go to Wayne Madsen.
[02:26:41.406 --> 02:26:43.127]  Wayne, this is bold.
[02:26:43.127 --> 02:26:45.868]  I mean, just the executive action level outside of law.
[02:26:45.868 --> 02:26:46.628]  What's your view on this?
[02:26:47.281 --> 02:26:53.604]  Well, I just wonder if this rule will apply to the CIA, which takes advantage of the fact that the U.S.
[02:26:53.604 --> 02:27:03.968]  is the largest manufacturer of small arms on the planet to export weapons to these jihadists, for example, fighting against Assad in Syria.
[02:27:03.968 --> 02:27:08.830]  The jihadists fighting against the government in Baghdad, which we supposedly supported.
[02:27:08.830 --> 02:27:10.531]  So are all these jihadists
[02:27:11.532 --> 02:27:21.419]  These weapons exported to the jihadists, John Brennan's brigades over in all these countries, are they going to have all this smart technology?
[02:27:21.419 --> 02:27:26.483]  I'd like to see the details of this proposal.
[02:27:26.483 --> 02:27:27.644]  Wayne, you're a genius.
[02:27:27.644 --> 02:27:31.647]  I want to headline it at Infowars.com with this video tomorrow morning.
[02:27:31.647 --> 02:27:33.048]  And other people can write the story too.
[02:27:33.048 --> 02:27:33.449]  I don't care.
[02:27:33.449 --> 02:27:35.711]  We're here to fight tyranny, not get scoops.
[02:27:35.711 --> 02:27:36.151]  Headline!
[02:27:36.451 --> 02:27:37.211]  Expert!
[02:27:37.211 --> 02:27:42.373]  Put biometric controls on guns shipped to Middle East so Al Qaeda can't use them.
[02:27:42.373 --> 02:27:47.075]  Of course, you know, put biometric controls or smart controls on guns you're shipping to jihadis.
[02:27:47.075 --> 02:27:49.296]  Or how about he just not ship them to the jihadis, Wayne?
[02:27:49.296 --> 02:27:50.116]  Exactly.
[02:27:50.116 --> 02:27:54.678]  Well, that would be a better idea, but let's see if this policy is going to be
[02:27:55.298 --> 02:27:55.959]  We're good to go.
[02:28:17.020 --> 02:28:22.722]  Tens of thousands in Egypt, though we've got a few thousand gun deaths here that are accidental or whatever a year.
[02:28:22.722 --> 02:28:25.683]  I mean, how about Obama make a big deal about what his jihad forces did?
[02:28:25.683 --> 02:28:26.343]  That's a great point.
[02:28:26.343 --> 02:28:28.424]  Are you going to cry about that, Wayne?
[02:28:28.424 --> 02:28:29.865]  Yeah, how about smart knives?
[02:28:29.865 --> 02:28:33.766]  Because we have people running around Europe now, you know, stabbing people.
[02:28:33.766 --> 02:28:40.569]  So I think... Let's skip the one clip, absolutely, and let's play Obama's cry moment as we go out to break here.
[02:28:40.569 --> 02:28:43.430]  Let's actually play with audio the cry moment, Wayne.
[02:28:43.430 --> 02:28:43.710]  Here it is.
[02:28:45.131 --> 02:28:48.372]  Our right to peaceful assembly.
[02:28:48.372 --> 02:28:56.015]  That right was robbed from moviegoers in Aurora and Lafayette.
[02:28:56.015 --> 02:29:06.859]  Our unalienable right to life and liberty and the pursuit of happiness, those rights were stripped from college kids in Blacksburg and Santa Barbara.
[02:29:06.859 --> 02:29:09.960]  When one of your wind-up toy drug addicts went crazy.
[02:29:09.960 --> 02:29:11.440]  Yeah, he wasn't a world punk.
[02:29:11.440 --> 02:29:12.420]  You don't take people's guns.
[02:29:12.420 --> 02:29:12.701]  Stop it!
[02:29:12.701 --> 02:29:13.661]  And from first graders.
[02:29:14.704 --> 02:29:15.425]  Done crimes down.
[02:29:15.425 --> 02:29:16.226]  Done crimes down.
[02:29:16.226 --> 02:29:17.187]  He starts crying.
[02:29:17.187 --> 02:29:18.128]  I want to get their guns.
[02:29:18.128 --> 02:29:19.169]  I want to dominate them.
[02:29:19.169 --> 02:29:20.110]  I want to do whatever I want.
[02:29:20.110 --> 02:29:22.752]  My jihad forces want to chop your heads off Obama's fingers.
[02:29:22.752 --> 02:29:23.713]  I hate this country.
[02:29:23.713 --> 02:29:24.394]  I must destroy it.
[02:29:24.394 --> 02:29:25.656]  I've only got one year to destroy it.
[02:29:25.656 --> 02:29:27.998]  I start crying.
[02:29:27.998 --> 02:29:28.619]  I hate America.
[02:29:30.376 --> 02:29:31.877]  I will break them.
[02:29:31.877 --> 02:29:32.998]  I will break them.
[02:29:32.998 --> 02:29:34.760]  I will get their guns.
[02:29:34.760 --> 02:29:36.181]  I will dominate.
[02:29:36.181 --> 02:29:38.183]  I'm gonna cry.
[02:29:38.183 --> 02:29:39.144]  Big cry.
[02:29:39.144 --> 02:29:39.984]  Gotta force it.
[02:29:39.984 --> 02:29:40.545]  There's no tears.
[02:29:40.545 --> 02:29:41.846]  We touch his eye.
[02:29:41.846 --> 02:29:43.788]  Oh my gosh.
[02:29:43.788 --> 02:29:48.472]  You couldn't get a job at the school play.
[02:29:48.472 --> 02:29:49.873]  We're on the march.
[02:29:49.873 --> 02:29:52.415]  The empire's on the run.
[02:29:52.415 --> 02:29:55.098]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:29:59.588 --> 02:30:11.058]  Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid wants the Federal Election Commission to make an exemption and allow him to pocket over $600,000 for retirement from a slush fund.
[02:30:11.058 --> 02:30:15.703]  FEC guidelines prohibit personal use of unspent PAC and campaign money.
[02:30:16.323 --> 02:30:22.887]  Punishment for violating the prohibition on personal use ranges from hefty fines to possible imprisonment.
[02:30:22.887 --> 02:30:28.690]  The money can be used as a contribution to charity or donated to the National Party Committee.
[02:30:28.690 --> 02:30:31.171]  Democrat FBC Chairwoman Anne Ravel
[02:30:31.451 --> 02:30:39.973]  Believes Reed has the right to the money due to his status as a, quote, historic and important figure and public official, end quote.
[02:30:39.973 --> 02:30:43.834]  The FEC has deferred action on Reed's request.
[02:30:43.834 --> 02:30:50.915]  FEC Commissioner Lee E. Goodman believes granting the request will send the wrong message and set a precedent.
[02:30:50.915 --> 02:30:54.796]  You can find more reports on InfoWars.com.

[02:33:11.920 --> 02:33:16.581]  It's provided for the safety and security of the American people.
[02:33:16.581 --> 02:33:18.742]  When are we going to defeat him?
[02:33:18.742 --> 02:33:20.942]  Obama is now channeling Boehner.
[02:33:20.942 --> 02:33:22.183]  Oh, come here, God.
[02:33:22.183 --> 02:33:23.423]  I have secret service.
[02:33:23.423 --> 02:33:25.503]  Please let me be my slave.
[02:33:25.503 --> 02:33:26.884]  Bitter clingers.
[02:33:26.884 --> 02:33:28.324]  Bitter clingers.
[02:33:28.324 --> 02:33:29.824]  Bitter clingers.
[02:33:29.824 --> 02:33:31.125]  I swore to Ghanim.
[02:33:31.125 --> 02:33:33.305]  I swore to Rothschild.
[02:33:33.305 --> 02:33:34.606]  I swore to Rockefeller.
[02:33:34.606 --> 02:33:36.286]  I swore to the American dream.
[02:33:36.286 --> 02:33:37.666]  I swore to... Oh, please.
[02:33:40.587 --> 02:33:49.036]  Take the shots, I want to kill you!
[02:33:49.036 --> 02:33:54.281]  I put my... myself through school.
[02:33:54.281 --> 02:33:57.424]  He's crying thinking about Obama when he shaved his back.
[02:33:57.424 --> 02:33:59.406]  Every wrong job there was.
[02:33:59.406 --> 02:34:00.787]  I want to make sure every kid is safe.
[02:34:00.787 --> 02:34:01.267]  And escaping.
[02:34:01.267 --> 02:34:01.848]  Good luck.
[02:34:06.064 --> 02:34:08.185]  The Alex Jones Show.
[02:34:08.185 --> 02:34:11.667]  Because there is a war on for your mind.
[02:34:11.667 --> 02:34:13.248]  Now with Boehner, I'll just start crying.
[02:34:13.248 --> 02:34:15.910]  I'll put it back on for kids.
[02:34:15.910 --> 02:34:20.273]  I certainly don't want the institution to go through this.
[02:34:20.273 --> 02:34:20.793]  That's all.
[02:34:20.793 --> 02:34:25.056]  He's got the tissue out.
[02:34:25.056 --> 02:34:26.556]  And hey, it's okay to cry sometimes.
[02:34:26.556 --> 02:34:27.897]  But with Boehner, he's obviously mentally ill.
[02:34:27.897 --> 02:34:29.658]  He cries when he talks about the weather.
[02:34:29.658 --> 02:34:30.419]  No, not grandma.
[02:34:30.419 --> 02:34:31.439]  Mama dies, you cry.
[02:34:31.439 --> 02:34:32.180]  But no, not with that.
[02:34:34.915 --> 02:34:36.456]  Obama with the fake crime.
[02:34:36.456 --> 02:34:37.736]  It's literally.
[02:34:37.736 --> 02:34:40.738]  He keeps touching his eye, obviously with pepper or something.
[02:34:40.738 --> 02:34:43.299]  He tries to squeeze a tear out.
[02:34:43.299 --> 02:34:46.621]  Like trying to squeeze blood out of a turnip.
[02:34:46.621 --> 02:34:47.541]  Totally ridiculous.
[02:34:47.541 --> 02:34:51.603]  Now here's the big bad news, because I'm up here having some fun because it's gallows humor.
[02:34:51.603 --> 02:34:53.584]  It's not funny.
[02:34:53.584 --> 02:34:55.565]  Redlinked, Infowars.com.
[02:34:55.565 --> 02:34:57.406]  Redlinked, Infowars.com.
[02:34:57.406 --> 02:34:58.927]  Redlinked, Infowars.com.
[02:34:58.927 --> 02:35:03.229]  I was told about this an hour ago and was so busy, I didn't even look at my own site, Infowars.com.
[02:35:04.767 --> 02:35:13.730]  It's in the text of the Health and Human Services report, in the big psychological manual they issue new mental illnesses every year.
[02:35:13.730 --> 02:35:24.893]  Believing the government's too big or wants to take your rights is a mental illness, oppositional defiant disorder, and you will have your guns taken for not wanting to turn your guns in.
[02:35:24.893 --> 02:35:30.455]  This is, they're coming, outside of law, it's InfoWars.com, it's RedLink, please send it.
[02:35:31.075 --> 02:35:33.397]  To the big mothership in the sky, DrugsReport.com.
[02:35:33.397 --> 02:35:34.518]  I mean, they already linked to us yesterday.
[02:35:34.518 --> 02:35:37.940]  I'm not saying drugs shouldn't link to us, but I think this is pretty important to point out.
[02:35:37.940 --> 02:35:39.121]  This is the angle.
[02:35:39.121 --> 02:35:43.625]  What they say is mentally ill, outside of law, they're the new acolytes.
[02:35:43.625 --> 02:35:44.325]  They're the new people.
[02:35:44.325 --> 02:35:54.113]  There's some psychologists or psychiatrists that are, you know, medical doctors you're going to see who aren't bad people, but a lot of them, I mean, they say it's mentally ill if you believe world government's being formed, or if you think fluoride's bad.
[02:35:54.915 --> 02:35:57.577]  That's what the Soviet Union used to oppress people.
[02:35:57.577 --> 02:36:00.839]  So Kit Daniels is in the control room.
[02:36:00.839 --> 02:36:02.040]  You talk about mental illness.
[02:36:02.040 --> 02:36:12.947]  I mean a big black control room with big banners and gold of George Washington and like actual media empire battling tyranny and reaching tens of millions of people a day now.
[02:36:12.947 --> 02:36:14.989]  I mean this is insane.
[02:36:14.989 --> 02:36:16.630]  What type of fruitcake
[02:36:18.112 --> 02:36:19.953]  He's wearing a purple shirt like me.
[02:36:19.953 --> 02:36:21.454]  That's probably we're in a cult now.
[02:36:21.454 --> 02:36:22.755]  I mean, what is going on?
[02:36:22.755 --> 02:36:24.956]  George Washington behind you?
[02:36:24.956 --> 02:36:26.817]  The terrorist.
[02:36:26.817 --> 02:36:28.398]  But I'm being sarcastic, but I'm not.
[02:36:28.398 --> 02:36:30.680]  I mean, this is insane, Kit Daniels.
[02:36:31.380 --> 02:36:45.391]  Yeah, the whole angle with mental illness, I've covered this for the past two years with various articles, is that the mental illness angle when it comes to gun control, that is the Trojan horse, back door gun confiscation program.
[02:36:45.391 --> 02:36:55.079]  Remember it was in the 1950s where you had the Soviet Union, the communist regime at the time, was declaring... Don't be racist, the loving liberal helpers!
[02:36:55.079 --> 02:37:00.383]  Yeah, they declared anybody who was against Stalin or whoever was in power
[02:37:01.244 --> 02:37:02.566]  To be mentally ill.
[02:37:02.566 --> 02:37:05.589]  And they came out with... And they would arrest you and torture you to death in many cases.
[02:37:05.589 --> 02:37:06.791]  But that's liberal and trendy.
[02:37:06.791 --> 02:37:08.753]  But if a few riders got banned, that's horrible.
[02:37:08.753 --> 02:37:09.654]  Let's make movies about it.
[02:37:09.654 --> 02:37:10.755]  Sorry, go ahead.
[02:37:10.755 --> 02:37:15.501]  Yeah, and it's like this whole thing is that back in the Soviet Union they were...
[02:37:16.823 --> 02:37:17.344]  Declaring
[02:37:36.323 --> 02:37:43.585]  They increased the number of mental illnesses from about 130 to over 350 today.
[02:37:43.585 --> 02:37:55.908]  And just think about how all the ADD cases, this has been in the news for the past 10-15 years, about how many so many kids that typically would have normal childlike behavior are now being put on Ritalin for saying that they have ADD.
[02:37:55.908 --> 02:37:56.928]  Oh yeah, oh yeah.
[02:37:56.928 --> 02:38:03.090]  I mean, you go to a medical doctor now, they just ask you, do you want antipsychotics, do you want
[02:38:04.969 --> 02:38:05.709]  Antidepressants.
[02:38:05.709 --> 02:38:06.950]  Do you want speed?
[02:38:06.950 --> 02:38:07.510]  Yeah.
[02:38:07.510 --> 02:38:09.611]  And I'm like, no, I don't want speed.
[02:38:09.611 --> 02:38:11.812]  And they go, but it's really good.
[02:38:11.812 --> 02:38:15.014]  And I'm just like, dude, are you like a guy at a bus stop trying to sell me drugs here?
[02:38:15.014 --> 02:38:15.954]  I mean, I got coffee.
[02:38:15.954 --> 02:38:16.215]  Okay.
[02:38:16.215 --> 02:38:17.495]  And I bounce off the walls on that.
[02:38:17.495 --> 02:38:18.596]  I do already.
[02:38:18.596 --> 02:38:20.257]  I drink four glasses of tea at Luby.
[02:38:20.257 --> 02:38:21.337]  I have heart palpitations.
[02:38:21.337 --> 02:38:22.738]  I do not need speed.
[02:38:22.738 --> 02:38:24.359]  Yeah, but exactly.
[02:38:24.359 --> 02:38:26.620]  This is how crazy this has gotten.
[02:38:26.620 --> 02:38:30.882]  And don't forget, this is the big backdoor attack, but also it's the trifecta.
[02:38:31.542 --> 02:38:36.566]  The going after social security recipients if they're getting automatic money transfers or have any type of home aid.
[02:38:36.566 --> 02:38:40.269]  Going through their database without law to persecute them with social workers.
[02:38:40.269 --> 02:38:42.031]  I mean, it's on.
[02:38:42.031 --> 02:38:44.953]  And then also saying you can't transfer a gun to family members.
[02:38:44.953 --> 02:38:46.575]  That's a national registration.
[02:38:46.575 --> 02:38:49.097]  This is the trifecta, brother.
[02:38:49.097 --> 02:38:50.858]  This is hammerfall.
[02:38:50.858 --> 02:38:59.906]  And we said last week it was coming and six months ago it was coming, but I thought they'd do one of these today and a few more later because the trifecta is nothing compared
[02:39:00.526 --> 02:39:04.308]  To the larger fact this is executive outside of law.
[02:39:04.308 --> 02:39:06.149]  That's not even being pointed out.
[02:39:06.149 --> 02:39:07.350]  So great job, Kit Daniels.
[02:39:07.350 --> 02:39:08.190]  Any other points?
[02:39:08.190 --> 02:39:14.373]  Yeah, I think what's coming up next, my prediction is they're going to try to enforce background checks to even use a gun.
[02:39:14.373 --> 02:39:18.335]  So, for example, if I go on a hunting trip with my friend or my father or whatever.
[02:39:18.335 --> 02:39:19.656]  You'll have to check in at the range.
[02:39:19.656 --> 02:39:20.936]  It's this whole smart thing.
[02:39:20.936 --> 02:39:25.219]  Yeah, I can't loan a gun out for someone to use in the deer stand without him and having a background check.
[02:39:26.366 --> 02:39:29.108]  And go back to the whole mental illness thing.
[02:39:29.108 --> 02:39:31.150]  It's a two-pronged attack.
[02:39:31.150 --> 02:39:39.696]  They use the DSM so broad to get people hooked on all these antidepressants, so Big Pharma can make money, and then they use that to take the guns.
[02:39:39.696 --> 02:39:39.996]  That's right.
[02:39:39.996 --> 02:39:45.781]  They don't tell you when a lady has a car wreck or has a kid, they go, hey, go on Luvox, go on Prozac, go on Paxil.
[02:39:45.781 --> 02:39:46.301]  They don't tell you.
[02:39:46.301 --> 02:39:48.483]  Now you're designated to be mentally ill, can't have a gun.
[02:39:49.206 --> 02:39:52.788]  It's like, oh, I don't know how you're a doctor, take this drug, it's so much fun, I like taking it, it's good.
[02:39:52.788 --> 02:39:56.710]  You take it, now your rights are gone, outside of law, because Obama said so.
[02:39:56.710 --> 02:40:02.752]  Get Daniels, I want everybody to get your article, Infowars.com, LinkedIn Red, maximum push, folks.
[02:40:02.752 --> 02:40:04.253]  This is an info war.
[02:40:04.253 --> 02:40:05.974]  Or bend over and take it, it's up to you.
[02:40:05.974 --> 02:40:13.438]  Yeah, it's not just the end on the Second Amendment, but also due process, that's the real critical point everybody should take.
[02:40:13.438 --> 02:40:17.820]  Executive power grab, due process, end of the course.
[02:40:17.820 --> 02:40:18.340]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[02:40:19.192 --> 02:40:25.699]  Yeah, I mean, it should outrage liberals that are even for gun control because this is a fight against due process.
[02:40:25.699 --> 02:40:27.261]  They're on a power trip.
[02:40:27.261 --> 02:40:29.163]  They think they're part of a cult that's taking over.
[02:40:29.163 --> 02:40:30.725]  They're making their move.
[02:40:30.725 --> 02:40:32.247]  They're not liberals, but I agree with you.
[02:40:32.247 --> 02:40:34.169]  God bless you.
[02:40:34.169 --> 02:40:36.712]  That story is up on Infowars.com, folks.
[02:40:36.712 --> 02:40:38.294]  It is worse than I thought.
[02:40:38.294 --> 02:40:39.936]  It is over-the-top what's happening.
[02:40:40.649 --> 02:40:44.392]  Let's go to our intrepid journalist.
[02:40:44.392 --> 02:41:01.468]  We've got, of course, Travis Wright, Travis Knight of the Knight Clan out there doing a great job there in Oregon at the site of the militia and the Bundys taking over a federal barn that was empty
[02:41:02.068 --> 02:41:05.712]  And it's being called the ultimate hijacking by the media, terrorism.
[02:41:05.712 --> 02:41:11.639]  Y'all, Qaeda is the hashtag, all this bull, evil white terrorists, you know, George Soros has crushed them.
[02:41:11.639 --> 02:41:15.743]  And I'm just saying, hey, probably not the best move with Obama doing the big gun grab right now.
[02:41:15.743 --> 02:41:23.011]  I get the fact the feds are stealing land and all this, but they're stealing it and prosecuting the Hammonds because
[02:41:24.178 --> 02:41:25.379]  Everybody does firebreaks.
[02:41:25.379 --> 02:41:26.680]  Kurt Neumann wrote an article about it.
[02:41:26.680 --> 02:41:27.541]  They did it.
[02:41:27.541 --> 02:41:28.923]  It burned into some of the federal land.
[02:41:28.923 --> 02:41:30.304]  That's what you do out there.
[02:41:30.304 --> 02:41:36.170]  They have indicted them, convicted them, you know, and it's just a kept group of slaves out there in Oregon to a certain extent.
[02:41:36.170 --> 02:41:39.152]  A lot of great people too, but it's not Southern Nevada.
[02:41:39.833 --> 02:41:44.036]  Where they've run out all the ranchers and all that's left is the Bundys and it's clear cut.
[02:41:44.036 --> 02:41:45.317]  And I think it's got bad optics.
[02:41:45.317 --> 02:41:46.617]  It doesn't mean I'm judging anybody.
[02:41:46.617 --> 02:41:47.998]  It doesn't mean I'm saying the Bundys are feds.
[02:41:47.998 --> 02:41:49.039]  I don't think they are.
[02:41:49.039 --> 02:41:52.741]  But I think the feds, undoubtedly every newspaper in the country, are using this.
[02:41:52.741 --> 02:41:54.963]  They're supposedly the FBI is going to cut the power.
[02:41:54.963 --> 02:41:57.164]  Biggs is about to talk about that.
[02:41:57.164 --> 02:41:58.745]  This is just perfect timing.
[02:41:58.745 --> 02:42:01.507]  I mean, all I'm going to say is, big present to Obama.
[02:42:01.507 --> 02:42:02.668]  Nobody can deny that.
[02:42:03.548 --> 02:42:07.151]  Some will say justice be done, may the heavens fall.
[02:42:07.151 --> 02:42:08.353]  And you know, maybe that's the case.
[02:42:08.353 --> 02:42:11.816]  But Joe Biggs, what are you witnessing out there in that blizzard?
[02:42:11.816 --> 02:42:13.397]  Joe Biggs here with InfoWars.com.
[02:42:13.397 --> 02:42:18.602]  Now we're live from the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge, just outside of Burns, Oregon.
[02:42:18.602 --> 02:42:22.746]  Now in Burns, there's actually quite a blizzard going on, and we're starting to get that snow over here now.
[02:42:22.746 --> 02:42:28.371]  You can barely even see the roads, so today should be interesting, seeing as the fact that The Guardian is reporting that the FBI
[02:42:28.971 --> 02:42:32.514]  That's right, and what smart advisors there are that have maneuvered the Bundys into this.
[02:42:32.514 --> 02:42:32.954]  Good friends!
[02:42:59.110 --> 02:43:06.574]  Yeah, there's definitely a chance that there could be some opposition that's inside, infiltrated to kind of go against Bundy.
[02:43:06.574 --> 02:43:17.279]  You know, I've had some people, some friends who work in special ops, some guys who are in the military for a long time, they actually have friends on the inside that said that there are snipers set up in positions.
[02:43:17.279 --> 02:43:19.240]  We do know that there's drones flying over.
[02:43:19.800 --> 02:43:24.302]  And one of the quotes that I was given was that they want to take out the Bundy Brothers.
[02:43:24.302 --> 02:43:25.303]  They don't like what they're doing.
[02:43:25.303 --> 02:43:33.086]  They don't like they're sparking up a revolution, getting people amassed and ready to come out here and stand up against the government.
[02:43:33.086 --> 02:43:37.488]  So they are at a point where they are done with the Bundy Brothers from what I've heard.
[02:43:37.488 --> 02:43:45.232]  So it's going to be an interesting day to say the least, especially if they cut off the power, the cell phone reception, and then set up a blockade to cut off the resupply route.
[02:43:46.994 --> 02:43:55.617]  Well, all I know is the globalists and people involved better watch their butts, because the Feds always burn their informants and their minions afterwards, and this is a big nasty coming down.
[02:43:55.617 --> 02:44:10.121]  One of the worst things that could happen, though, is if they actually were to try to do something, all that's going to do is make the Bundys martyr, and then you're going to see a large group of people across this country stand up, rise up, and you're going to see a lot more of these standoffs happen.
[02:44:10.121 --> 02:44:13.062]  Which is exactly... Here's my issue.
[02:44:13.062 --> 02:44:14.022]  Tell me if you agree or disagree.
[02:44:14.722 --> 02:44:15.883]  The Bundys are great people.
[02:44:15.883 --> 02:44:16.563]  I get their point.
[02:44:16.563 --> 02:44:17.544]  The Feds are out of control.
[02:44:17.544 --> 02:44:18.464]  It's wrong.
[02:44:18.464 --> 02:44:19.705]  It's a 0-21.
[02:44:19.705 --> 02:44:21.066]  The locals don't want them.
[02:44:21.066 --> 02:44:22.967]  The Hammonds don't want it.
[02:44:22.967 --> 02:44:24.928]  And that's why this dog doesn't hunt.
[02:44:24.928 --> 02:44:27.429]  This isn't their land, their grazing rights.
[02:44:27.429 --> 02:44:29.250]  It doesn't have the same optics.
[02:44:29.250 --> 02:44:31.291]  And this is perfect timing for Obama.
[02:44:31.291 --> 02:44:37.915]  Why have the Bundys been out there for months off and on, and now all this breaks loose right when Obama rolls out his offensive against the Patriots?
[02:44:37.915 --> 02:44:39.496]  I mean, come on, people.
[02:44:39.496 --> 02:44:41.077]  This really smells.
[02:44:42.520 --> 02:44:55.579]  Yeah, it's definitely interesting how this is all played out, and it will be interesting to see how this unfolds over the next 24 hours, especially when they're expecting more snow to fall, temperatures to drop, to see how this happens.
[02:44:55.579 --> 02:44:57.522]  Now, today we went out and investigated
[02:44:58.443 --> 02:44:59.684]  Well, this is just a giant
[02:45:28.183 --> 02:45:30.849]  Extravaganza for the establishment with the wrong optics.
[02:45:30.849 --> 02:45:32.994]  I mean, I couldn't pick a worse place.
[02:45:33.831 --> 02:45:36.632]  For this to be going down in a worse time.
[02:45:36.632 --> 02:45:38.312]  But that said, it's a free country.
[02:45:38.312 --> 02:45:40.993]  Folks can do what they want, can't they?
[02:45:40.993 --> 02:45:55.177]  And I'm just going to continue to try to warn folks that we have an executive branch power grab, outside of law, to register guns, not let you transfer guns, to let psychologists take guns whenever they want, to take Social Security recipients' guns.
[02:45:55.177 --> 02:45:56.897]  I mean, this is in politico.
[02:45:56.897 --> 02:46:01.038]  And to now say, if you criticize the government, your guns can be taken.
[02:46:01.038 --> 02:46:02.859]  I mean, this is worse than I thought.
[02:46:03.419 --> 02:46:10.244]  Well, the interesting thing is what happened in Waco with the Davidians when the FBI did roll in and they shut off the power.
[02:46:10.244 --> 02:46:11.305]  Is this going to happen again?
[02:46:11.305 --> 02:46:16.810]  Are they going to have another assault like that here at the refuge?
[02:46:18.137 --> 02:46:22.659]  And by the way, the RNC head has announced Obama gun control executive actions as dangerous power grabs.
[02:46:22.659 --> 02:46:26.100]  So finally, that narrative just the last few hours is getting out there.
[02:46:26.100 --> 02:46:30.021]  That's bigger than the seven gun grabs they're announcing and the three big ones.
[02:46:30.021 --> 02:46:35.703]  Is that the president can't shut our power plants off because he felt like it when he was on his prayer rug in the morning.
[02:46:35.703 --> 02:46:42.665]  The president can't just take our guns because he found it in the toilet, you know, and decided it was a royal scroll or something.
[02:46:42.665 --> 02:46:43.886]  The president is not God.
[02:46:45.029 --> 02:46:49.550]  And, uh, you know, him and all his degenerate supporters think they're about to have some great war.
[02:46:49.550 --> 02:46:55.892]  And, I mean, my God, the George Soros people saying these are white terrorists and Yale-Qaeda and all this.
[02:46:55.892 --> 02:46:58.133]  I mean, they are really just spoiling.
[02:46:58.133 --> 02:46:59.634]  I mean, absolutely spoiling for a war.
[02:47:01.468 --> 02:47:05.969]  Last time I had an opportunity to actually go down here to where the federal facilities are.
[02:47:05.969 --> 02:47:08.289]  There's about seven or eight buildings down there.
[02:47:08.289 --> 02:47:11.730]  And when I went down there, this was after they had let certain media go through.
[02:47:11.730 --> 02:47:14.411]  I got my own little private tour later on in the afternoon.
[02:47:14.411 --> 02:47:18.191]  There were guys and they're shoveling snow off the sidewalks.
[02:47:18.191 --> 02:47:22.632]  None of the federal trucks or vehicles had been broken into, bothered.
[02:47:22.632 --> 02:47:26.973]  None of the buildings that I could see from the outside looking in were damaged in any kind of way.
[02:47:27.353 --> 02:47:28.934]  So they're not down there running amok.
[02:47:28.934 --> 02:47:35.236]  They really do have, I believe Bundy has a pure intention that he does want to take care of the land.
[02:47:35.236 --> 02:47:37.176]  But like you said, there is a timing.
[02:47:37.176 --> 02:47:42.038]  This is coming at a wrong time with Obama coming out with this gun grab initiative.
[02:47:42.038 --> 02:47:43.178]  He wants all this to happen.
[02:47:43.178 --> 02:47:47.800]  So it's definitely going to be an interesting and intense next 24 hours here in Oregon.
[02:47:49.155 --> 02:47:49.975]  Well, I agree with you.
[02:47:49.975 --> 02:47:52.196]  You can see the Daily Mail and everybody else.
[02:47:52.196 --> 02:47:55.218]  Join the Bunny Militia Group at the Center of Oregon Land Dispute.
[02:47:55.218 --> 02:48:05.422]  It's taken to task by Twitter as they are mocked by hashtags including the Al-Qaeda and Yeehawness Meal Team Six.
[02:48:05.422 --> 02:48:10.945]  And look, I get you that the bunnies are great people and the optics were right.
[02:48:10.945 --> 02:48:12.806]  The cause was right in there.
[02:48:15.025 --> 02:48:16.266]  But I mean, here's my deal.
[02:48:16.266 --> 02:48:19.788]  It's like getting permission to go down by the federal buildings.
[02:48:19.788 --> 02:48:21.028]  Well, I thought you're a citizen.
[02:48:21.028 --> 02:48:22.609]  It's the people's land.
[02:48:22.609 --> 02:48:24.990]  I'm told there's people with gates and controls into there.
[02:48:24.990 --> 02:48:29.612]  I mean, if it's just so open to the public, can I just, can I just waltz in?
[02:48:29.612 --> 02:48:31.233]  Or am I evil, Joe Biggs?
[02:48:32.990 --> 02:48:33.831]  Yeah, you're evil.
[02:48:33.831 --> 02:48:34.811]  We're all evil.
[02:48:34.811 --> 02:48:40.735]  We're the sheep that the government want to run around and push around.
[02:48:40.735 --> 02:48:46.939]  And that's why you see a lot of people changing now when you have people like Donald Trump standing up and saying what people are too scared to say.
[02:48:46.939 --> 02:48:51.682]  And when you see patriots coming across and gathering and saying, hey, enough is enough.
[02:48:51.682 --> 02:48:52.523]  We're tired.
[02:48:52.523 --> 02:48:54.504]  This is a great, this is going to be a great year.
[02:48:54.504 --> 02:48:59.327]  2016 will be a year of a great awakening that's already been happening.
[02:48:59.327 --> 02:49:02.069]  But this year will be a pivotal time in American history.
[02:49:03.274 --> 02:49:03.874]  That's right.
[02:49:03.874 --> 02:49:12.859]  And MSNBC's Harris Perry that says your kids don't belong to you and that whites are the biggest problem in America says confiscate legal guns so men don't shoot their wives.
[02:49:12.859 --> 02:49:14.821]  I mean, they are going full-blown pressure.
[02:49:14.821 --> 02:49:16.201]  I mean, well look at this.
[02:49:16.201 --> 02:49:18.122]  Look at this.
[02:49:18.122 --> 02:49:18.663]  What's his name?
[02:49:18.663 --> 02:49:20.023]  Montel.
[02:49:20.023 --> 02:49:21.244]  Yeah, Montel Williams.
[02:49:21.244 --> 02:49:31.410]  Last night he was tweeting and the night before said that white terror had struck Oregon and I made a couple of videos on my own personal accounts and in fact, as you can see, white terror is falling from the sky.
[02:49:32.182 --> 02:49:35.288]  That's right, it's snowing pretty hard.
[02:49:35.288 --> 02:49:39.295]  Hold on, Joe, for your Skype to come back.
[02:49:39.295 --> 02:49:39.996]  Here's my question.
[02:49:44.867 --> 02:49:50.349]  Yesterday I was saying, go in and interview the people in there, and you're like, well I have to wait until they let me in and go in there.
[02:49:50.349 --> 02:49:57.412]  My point is, is it, because I get what they're doing, but is it federal land, people's land, or is it their land now, the folks inside?
[02:49:57.412 --> 02:50:05.515]  I mean, are they letting the general public or people they've called from all over the country to come there, are they letting them into the group of federal buildings?
[02:50:05.515 --> 02:50:06.315]  We just lost bigs.
[02:50:06.315 --> 02:50:11.817]  I mean, that's what I'm getting at, because, you know, it's kind of like the feds don't have any right to say who can be in here, but, you know.
[02:50:13.061 --> 02:50:19.966]  I mean that's what this comes down to is I don't want a coup in this country because nine times out of ten you get something worse than what you just had.
[02:50:19.966 --> 02:50:24.650]  And we're making major inroads with governors and other people trying to turn this country around.
[02:50:24.650 --> 02:50:27.292]  And Soros wants a war with police?
[02:50:27.292 --> 02:50:27.752]  I'm against it.
[02:50:30.384 --> 02:50:31.565]  The government wants to take the guns?
[02:50:31.565 --> 02:50:32.305]  I'm against it.
[02:50:32.305 --> 02:50:35.007]  The point is, Joe, I'm going to come back and talk to you on the other side.
[02:50:35.007 --> 02:50:36.608]  I want to ask you a question.
[02:50:36.608 --> 02:50:41.692]  Is it free to go into these federal buildings that they've taken over, or is it theirs now?
[02:50:41.692 --> 02:50:43.133]  No one else is allowed to get in.
[02:50:43.133 --> 02:50:51.339]  I know you're going to be talking to one of the Bundy sons later tonight for the Nightly News, so we can ask that question, because I remember you were yesterday talking about getting permission to go in.
[02:50:51.339 --> 02:50:54.081]  I mean, did you get that from the feds or the folks that are in there?
[02:50:54.081 --> 02:50:54.661]  Who's the boss?
[02:50:54.661 --> 02:50:57.123]  I guess citizens aren't welcome in America?
[02:50:57.123 --> 02:50:57.964]  We'll be back.
[02:50:59.381 --> 02:51:06.468]  Something just happened that has explained why survival food is literally flying off the shelves and has sold out in many areas of the country.
[02:51:06.468 --> 02:51:10.472]  It caught me totally by surprise, and it involves FEMA.
[02:51:10.472 --> 02:51:13.875]  I couldn't believe FEMA tried this until I saw proof.
[02:51:13.875 --> 02:51:18.960]  Revealing their secret could land me in hot water, but I think you deserve to know exactly what they're doing.
[02:51:19.560 --> 02:51:23.902]  Watch the viral video at FEMA3.com before it disappears again.
[02:51:23.902 --> 02:51:30.084]  But be warned, it's really disturbing because the fact is, they must know something we don't.
[02:51:30.084 --> 02:51:40.088]  Go to FEMA3.com to see the number one item you should be hoarding and why supplies of this critical item are so low or even completely sold out at many stores across America.
[02:51:40.808 --> 02:51:42.029]  Don't miss out.
[02:51:42.029 --> 02:51:47.232]  Watch the controversial video that thousands of other smart patriots have already seen in recent days.

[02:52:59.436 --> 02:53:02.178]  The following statements have not been evaluated by the FDA.
[02:53:02.178 --> 02:53:05.660]  This product is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease.
[02:53:06.883 --> 02:53:10.365]  Something shocking just happened in a Coast Guard unit in San Diego.
[02:53:10.365 --> 02:53:15.807]  The old guys in the unit have turned the tables and are now destroying the young bucks in head-to-head fitness tests.
[02:53:15.807 --> 02:53:17.288]  How is this even possible?
[02:53:17.288 --> 02:53:24.831]  Turns out, the old guys in this unit have been part of a special test group for a doctor-formulated fountain of youth drink called Patriot Power Greens.
[02:53:24.831 --> 02:53:32.474]  Patriot Power Greens has been so effective for many of the older soldiers that it's made their achy joints, stiff muscles, and lack of energy a thing of the past.
[02:53:32.474 --> 02:53:35.676]  Previously, this drink was only available to elite military units.
[02:53:35.956 --> 02:53:43.784]  But for a limited time, the creator of Patriot Power Greens has set aside a small number of free samples specifically for our conservative friends.
[02:53:43.784 --> 02:53:46.947]  All they ask is that you chip in a few bucks to cover shipping.
[02:53:46.947 --> 02:53:51.072]  To claim your free samples of Patriot Power Greens, go to Greens75.com.
[02:53:51.072 --> 02:53:51.772]  That's Greens75.com.
[02:53:51.772 --> 02:53:52.173]  Greens75.com.
[02:54:21.869 --> 02:54:29.035]  Alright, I'm going five minutes to the next hour, then David Knight's taking over with all the latest breaking news, more of the Obama gun grab clips.
[02:54:29.035 --> 02:54:33.458]  We're at an advantage but also at a negative on two different fronts.
[02:54:33.458 --> 02:54:41.465]  We know what's coming before it comes, we're informed, but then when it actually comes, we're almost kind of comfortable with it because we knew it was coming forever.
[02:54:41.465 --> 02:54:46.649]  But just look back at all the stuff we're putting up with and then just know it's going to get worse till we say no.
[02:54:46.649 --> 02:54:49.091]  And no complying with this corrupt system doesn't help us.
[02:54:50.043 --> 02:55:01.026]  But at the same time, going too far, you know, with armed sit-ins, in the middle of nowhere, where the system can demonize you, I don't think it's a good idea overall.
[02:55:01.026 --> 02:55:05.607]  We're going to go back to Joe Biggs and get his take on this and where this is going.
[02:55:05.607 --> 02:55:10.468]  But before we do that, if you're not spreading the word about this broadcast, you're crazy.
[02:55:10.468 --> 02:55:12.809]  I mean, we reach 20-plus million people a week now.
[02:55:12.809 --> 02:55:14.249]  We're growing exponentially.
[02:55:14.249 --> 02:55:15.389]  We're under enemy attack.
[02:55:15.389 --> 02:55:17.910]  We're clearly a flagship operation against tyranny.
[02:55:18.510 --> 02:55:23.173]  We're committed, we're craved, we're unapologetic, we're foaming at the mouth quite frankly.
[02:55:23.173 --> 02:55:25.194]  That's what it takes to defeat the enemy.
[02:55:25.194 --> 02:55:28.377]  As one of the top samurai said, I forget his name, he said, desperate
[02:55:31.857 --> 02:55:35.358]  Desperateness is the way of the samurai.
[02:55:35.358 --> 02:55:39.139]  A hundred men cannot stand against a man who's desperate.
[02:55:39.139 --> 02:55:41.400]  And it just totally turns himself loose.
[02:55:41.400 --> 02:55:45.461]  And that means not caring what your neighbors think, not caring whatever happens, just do the right thing.
[02:55:45.461 --> 02:55:49.982]  And so I get the way of the samurai is being desperateness, what the Bundys are doing.
[02:55:49.982 --> 02:55:52.583]  But there's kind of a middle way in all of that.
[02:55:52.583 --> 02:55:57.284]  And maybe I'll be proven wrong, but I supported what they did at great risk the last go-round.
[02:55:57.284 --> 02:56:00.225]  I mean, who knows what could have happened there, but it all seemed and felt right.
[02:56:00.825 --> 02:56:02.666]  My good ol' boy guts don't feel good.
[02:56:02.666 --> 02:56:03.647]  Maybe I'm wrong.
[02:56:03.647 --> 02:56:04.747]  Maybe we'll work this out.
[02:56:04.747 --> 02:56:09.871]  Maybe us being concerned and you being concerned and wargaming this is going to fix it.
[02:56:09.871 --> 02:56:15.034]  But when we come out and say, watch out for feds infiltrating and provocateuring, shut up, you said I'm a fed, boy!
[02:56:15.034 --> 02:56:19.697]  I mean, when you hear that, you got to go, whoa, that doesn't sound too good right there.
[02:56:20.728 --> 02:56:23.491]  That's like saying, watch out for lightning strikes and thunderstorms.
[02:56:23.491 --> 02:56:25.193]  People go, that's crazy.
[02:56:25.193 --> 02:56:29.258]  But anyways, 15% off all the products right now at InfoWarsTore.com.

[02:56:51.333 --> 02:56:57.214]  InfoWars is the house you built just as much as myself and my reporters and my great crew.
[02:56:57.214 --> 02:57:07.377]  So PrisonPlanet.tv, InfoWarsNews.com, InfoWarsLife.com for the nutraceuticals, InfoWarsStore.com is the big umbrella site for all our products from high quality water filters
[02:57:07.677 --> 02:57:08.918]  The Nutraceuticals.
[02:57:08.918 --> 02:57:21.166]  Okay, Joe Biggs, what I was getting to is I get security say don't let anybody into the buildings, but it kind of becomes a way to control people too and say nobody can come across to these buildings if these are the people's buildings.
[02:57:21.166 --> 02:57:23.328]  Where does that stand?
[02:57:23.328 --> 02:57:26.150]  Yeah, I understand what you're saying, but I also have some breaking news right now.
[02:57:26.150 --> 02:57:28.651]  Dave and I just texted Travis.
[02:57:28.651 --> 02:57:34.035]  Apparently, they have shut down Ammon Bundy's Twitter account, so they are now starting to cut off
[02:57:34.961 --> 02:57:40.323]  Lines of communication for the Bundys and the militia within the compound.
[02:57:40.323 --> 02:57:44.045]  And you're going to interview Eamon in a few hours, right?
[02:57:44.045 --> 02:57:52.709]  Hopefully, if everything is still cool, calm, and collective, and they don't shut off the power and start drawing the place up, and there is a compound and Eamon Bundy to talk to, then yes.
[02:57:52.709 --> 02:58:01.533]  Well, the feds have said they're not going to go in for a long time, so I think everything's fine, but that's why they need to be able to get their story out to the reporters and make it about
[02:58:02.540 --> 02:58:06.666]  What's happening, obviously, with the land grant that is totally illegal.
[02:58:06.666 --> 02:58:08.748]  I mean, the feds are total criminals.
[02:58:08.748 --> 02:58:10.851]  Oh, of course.
[02:58:10.851 --> 02:58:11.833]  Other points, David Knight.
[02:58:17.526 --> 02:58:19.207]  David's got trouble here in my feed.
[02:58:19.207 --> 02:58:23.030]  We're going to come back after break and see if he's able to get my audio now.
[02:58:23.030 --> 02:58:24.071]  We're sending out music.
[02:58:24.071 --> 02:58:26.352]  That's why we're cutting off his audio feed.
[02:58:26.352 --> 02:58:32.337]  We'll be right back in the fourth hour with David Knight, Joe Biggs, and yours truly, Alex Jones.
[02:58:32.337 --> 02:58:34.078]  This is The Info War.
[02:58:34.078 --> 02:58:35.699]  They're coming for the guns.
[02:58:35.699 --> 02:58:38.321]  Get active now or the enemy's going to win.
[02:58:38.321 --> 02:58:40.803]  And yes, the president is flooding us with radical jihadists.
[02:58:40.803 --> 02:58:42.824]  When they attack, he will try to take the guns.
[02:58:42.824 --> 02:58:43.685]  Spread the word now.
[02:58:43.685 --> 02:58:44.665]  He's very unpopular.
[02:58:44.665 --> 02:58:45.406]  He can be defeated.
[02:58:48.951 --> 02:58:54.013]  Over the years, there have been a lot of powerful advancements in the field of science and nutraceuticals.
[02:58:54.013 --> 02:59:02.675]  Longevity integrates years of scientific research into creating fantastic products like Beyond Tangy Tangerine, plant-derived minerals, and much more.
[02:59:02.675 --> 02:59:06.797]  Longevity also offers you an ingenious way to augment your income.
[02:59:06.797 --> 02:59:07.597]  And the best part?
[02:59:07.597 --> 02:59:10.478]  You'll be helping your friends and family along the way.

[02:59:30.806 --> 02:59:31.366]  It's simple.
[02:59:31.366 --> 02:59:34.308]  Just go to Infowarsteam.com today.
[02:59:34.308 --> 02:59:36.409]  Complete a short sign-up and you're part of the team.
[02:59:36.409 --> 02:59:39.650]  That's Infowarsteam.com or Infowarshealth.com.
[02:59:39.650 --> 02:59:45.953]  So many people call into my radio show and tell me how Longevity and the products at Infowarsteam.com have changed their lives.
[02:59:45.953 --> 02:59:47.254]  Check it out for yourself today.
[02:59:51.475 --> 02:59:54.089]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show!
[03:00:06.853 --> 03:00:10.057]  You want answers?
[03:00:10.057 --> 03:00:11.578]  Well, so does he.
[03:00:11.578 --> 03:00:13.640]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:00:13.640 --> 03:00:18.445]  Alright, folks, final statement.
[03:00:18.445 --> 03:00:20.107]  We lost our link to Joe Biggs.
[03:00:20.107 --> 03:00:22.149]  We're gonna try to get him back up right now.
[03:00:22.149 --> 03:00:26.854]  Vladimir Putin's spy chief dies suddenly at 58, Kremlin reveals.
[03:00:27.995 --> 03:00:37.737]  General Igor Surgun played a key role in the annexation of Crimea and in action by the Russian Armed Forces in Eastern Ukraine along with Moscow's airstrikes in Syria.
[03:00:37.737 --> 03:00:48.820]  And now he's magically died and that is probably undoubtedly a major shot across the bow of how serious these spy wars are that are just escalating and escalating.
[03:00:48.820 --> 03:00:51.540]  Obama's crying fuels speculation it was faked.
[03:00:51.540 --> 03:00:52.480]  Really you think it was fake?
[03:00:52.480 --> 03:00:54.641]  Everything that comes out of his mouth is faked.
[03:00:56.218 --> 03:01:00.361]  Also, we've got the contest that I'm going to be announcing the winners of in the next few days.
[03:01:00.361 --> 03:01:06.885]  Top funniest clips about Hillary Clinton are up on InfoWars.com.
[03:01:06.885 --> 03:01:14.651]  You can see the folks that I think are some of the top entries.
[03:01:16.352 --> 03:01:18.613]  Again, they've only got one video in this article.
[03:01:18.613 --> 03:01:20.234]  I know there's like six or seven I'm looking at.
[03:01:20.234 --> 03:01:22.435]  I haven't judged yet, but I think they're the best.
[03:01:22.435 --> 03:01:31.259]  And I think when we post this, just a note to everybody, we should post whatever the last big videos are just in... Oh, it's a compilation video.
[03:01:31.259 --> 03:01:32.139]  Okay.
[03:01:32.139 --> 03:01:32.940]  Oh, so that's what it is.
[03:01:32.940 --> 03:01:33.780]  Even better.
[03:01:33.780 --> 03:01:35.401]  So you can see the top ones there.
[03:01:35.401 --> 03:01:36.942]  I'm just kind of editing live here on air.
[03:01:37.947 --> 03:01:40.809]  You kind of get an arrogant, laissez-faire attitude from me.
[03:01:40.809 --> 03:01:42.311]  Not because I'm arrogant or laissez-faire.
[03:01:42.311 --> 03:01:43.352]  I just do this so much.
[03:01:43.352 --> 03:01:45.613]  It's just kind of like once you're in a fight, you're just swinging.
[03:01:45.613 --> 03:01:47.515]  You're pretty relaxed.
[03:01:47.515 --> 03:01:49.417]  Going back to Joe Biggs, I'm told we have?
[03:01:49.417 --> 03:01:52.259]  Because my audio's a bit muffled.
[03:01:52.259 --> 03:01:53.180]  Okay.
[03:01:53.180 --> 03:01:56.963]  Joe, other developments, other things that are unfolding?
[03:01:56.963 --> 03:01:58.104]  Nothing new right now at the time.
[03:01:58.104 --> 03:01:59.785]  We just kind of changed our location right here.
[03:01:59.785 --> 03:02:02.207]  You can actually kind of see down to the compound.
[03:02:02.207 --> 03:02:04.289]  There are quite a few buildings over in that area.
[03:02:05.771 --> 03:02:07.312]  We still haven't seen any police show up yet.
[03:02:07.312 --> 03:02:08.472]  We still haven't seen any agents.
[03:02:08.472 --> 03:02:10.133]  We haven't heard anything yet.
[03:02:10.133 --> 03:02:15.895]  So we're going to be standing by trying to get an interview with Amon Bundy later on this afternoon.
[03:02:15.895 --> 03:02:19.316]  And we'll be bringing updates as soon as we can.
[03:02:19.316 --> 03:02:21.117]  So we've got a couple videos already filed.
[03:02:21.117 --> 03:02:22.397]  We're just trying to get those uploaded.
[03:02:22.397 --> 03:02:26.359]  But the internet signal and the cell phone signal out here is not too good.
[03:02:26.359 --> 03:02:26.879]  I understand.
[03:02:26.879 --> 03:02:29.480]  We'll try to interview some of the Hammonds as well, some of the locals.
[03:02:30.148 --> 03:02:31.048]  Oh, it's about 20 degrees, I think.
[03:02:52.378 --> 03:02:57.382]  So I'm sure that'll drop again tonight as the darkness starts to settle like last time.
[03:02:57.382 --> 03:03:01.826]  It got down to about, I believe, like 15 or 14 when the snow started coming in.
[03:03:01.826 --> 03:03:04.067]  And as you can see, it's kind of snowing here, but it's not that bad.
[03:03:04.067 --> 03:03:10.312]  Like over in Burns, right over to my left, or to my right actually, to your left, it is a blizzard going on.
[03:03:10.312 --> 03:03:12.354]  I could barely even see, you could barely even see the roads.
[03:03:12.354 --> 03:03:15.456]  The cops had a lot of areas blocked off due to bad traffic.
[03:03:15.456 --> 03:03:17.138]  So we're going to have to go through a lot of that later on.
[03:03:18.200 --> 03:03:19.261]  All right, Joe.
[03:03:19.261 --> 03:03:20.962]  Continue to cover all that with Travis.
[03:03:20.962 --> 03:03:21.402]  God bless.
[03:03:21.402 --> 03:03:25.105]  We'll talk to you again tonight on the Nightly News, 7 o'clock Central.
[03:03:25.105 --> 03:03:26.446]  Thank you.
[03:03:26.446 --> 03:03:28.688]  All right, look at these drug report headlines.
[03:03:28.688 --> 03:03:32.951]  Obama refers to himself 76 times in speech.
[03:03:32.951 --> 03:03:35.213]  Best gun salesman on the planet.
[03:03:35.213 --> 03:03:37.714]  Arms ban for some Social Security beneficiaries.
[03:03:37.714 --> 03:03:39.696]  Doctors can report mentally ill patients.
[03:03:39.696 --> 03:03:42.158]  The FBI under new rule.
[03:03:42.158 --> 03:03:43.639]  New rule, not a law, just a rule.
[03:03:45.003 --> 03:03:47.225]  I mean, this is actually happening.
[03:03:47.225 --> 03:03:50.487]  This is, this is, this is crazy.
[03:03:50.487 --> 03:03:52.269]  This is out of control.
[03:03:52.269 --> 03:03:54.410]  But again, it's lawless.
[03:03:54.410 --> 03:03:56.452]  It's only going to wake people up faster.
[03:03:56.452 --> 03:03:58.914]  Congress is illegitimate with a 9% approval rating.
[03:03:58.914 --> 03:04:02.036]  They want to start a race war with Black Lives Matter.
[03:04:02.036 --> 03:04:02.777]  It's on record.
[03:04:02.777 --> 03:04:04.498]  They want to start civil unrest.
[03:04:04.498 --> 03:04:09.622]  They want to start the Patriots blowing stuff up or shooting people or doing things they can demonize.
[03:04:09.622 --> 03:04:10.703]  And then false flag us.
[03:04:10.703 --> 03:04:11.664]  We've got to be there to expose it.
[03:04:12.364 --> 03:04:20.572]  Just realize, I can look at the tea leaves here, anybody can look at the angles, we're winning on a lot of fronts because the enemy's being exposed.
[03:04:20.572 --> 03:04:23.775]  Really good things are happening right now.
[03:04:23.775 --> 03:04:28.660]  At a sick level, I almost wish Trump didn't get elected, Hillary did, it'd really be over then, but no, she'd be too dangerous.
[03:04:28.660 --> 03:04:29.601]  I like Trump.
[03:04:29.601 --> 03:04:34.947]  The problem is they may blame the imploding economy on him, or Rand Paul, or whoever.
[03:04:35.964 --> 03:04:42.626]  There's a lot of other news coming up with David Knight on the other side of this break.
[03:04:42.626 --> 03:04:47.988]  He's locked and loaded like a top stallion in the gates for three hours waiting.
[03:04:47.988 --> 03:04:51.049]  So we're going to unleash the Kraken in three minutes.
[03:04:51.049 --> 03:04:53.370]  I'm Alex Jones, InfoWars.com.
[03:04:53.370 --> 03:04:56.971]  We're back to Austin in a few hours, and I should be back tomorrow, Lord willing, 11 a.m.
[03:04:56.971 --> 03:04:57.291]  Central.
[03:04:59.232 --> 03:05:11.695]  While President Obama attempts to enact gun control via executive action, a new Gallup poll shows that only 2% of Americans believe that guns or gun control are among the country's top problems.
[03:05:11.695 --> 03:05:18.777]  Gallup asked about 1,000 Americans in all 50 states what they thought the nation's top problems were in 2015.
[03:05:18.777 --> 03:05:25.379]  And out of 23 problems mentioned by Americans, guns, gun control ranked near the bottom at 19th.
[03:05:25.379 --> 03:05:26.159]  In comparison,
[03:05:26.559 --> 03:05:30.902]  Sixteen percent of Americans said that the government was the nation's biggest issue.
[03:05:30.902 --> 03:05:32.703]  Thirteen percent said the economy.
[03:05:32.703 --> 03:05:37.026]  Eight percent said unemployment, and another eight said immigration.
[03:05:37.026 --> 03:05:52.436]  But rather than working on these hot-button issues, both President Obama and the mainstream media would rather focus on gun control, with the president even stating that he wants to, quote, make gun control part of his legacy, end quote, according to CNN.
[03:05:52.436 --> 03:05:56.159]  You can find more reports on InfoWars.com.

[03:06:58.587 --> 03:07:05.491]  In the 15-year history of PrisonPlanet.TV, we have never offered six months free at Christmas.
[03:07:05.491 --> 03:07:08.393]  We've always offered five months free.
[03:07:08.393 --> 03:07:14.316]  But since I announced six free months a few days ago, we have seen record numbers of signups.
[03:07:14.316 --> 03:07:17.718]  PrisonPlanet.TV began 15 years ago.
[03:07:17.718 --> 03:07:21.020]  It's grown into InfoWars, Nightly News, and so much more.
[03:07:21.020 --> 03:07:23.802]  All of my documentary films, scores of e-books,

[03:07:40.959 --> 03:07:48.521]  You can also sign up for a trial month and only pay $5.95, and then 20 of you and your friends and family can watch PrisonPlanet.tv.

[03:08:02.214 --> 03:08:04.555]  I was trained in firearms.
[03:08:04.555 --> 03:08:06.696]  I carried a concealed weapon.
[03:08:06.696 --> 03:08:15.679]  I made the determination that if somebody was going to try to take me out, I was going to take them with me.
[03:08:15.679 --> 03:08:29.524]  If I could have gotten 51 votes in the Senate of the United States for an outright ban, picking up every one of them, Mr. and Mrs. America, turn them all in, I would have done it.
[03:08:31.480 --> 03:08:36.323]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[03:08:36.323 --> 03:08:42.828]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:08:42.828 --> 03:08:44.129]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:08:44.129 --> 03:08:50.834]  I'm David Knight here with Jakari Jackson in this fourth hour of the Alex Jones broadcast and I wanted to tell Alex this.
[03:08:50.834 --> 03:08:55.017]  I'm sure he'll hear this but he's been proven right yet again.
[03:08:55.017 --> 03:08:58.959]  This is something that Kelley McBrain who works here gave me and of course
[03:09:00.120 --> 03:09:07.123]  Alex has said many times that the chemicals in the water are changing the sex of the fish and other things.
[03:09:07.123 --> 03:09:14.485]  He's been ridiculed about that by Rachel Maddow, Chris Hayes, others at MSNBC and elsewhere, distorting his comments.
[03:09:14.485 --> 03:09:17.927]  Well, this is something that was put out by Science Magazine on January the 4th.
[03:09:18.767 --> 03:09:22.829]  And it referenced back to an article from the Washington Post on December 30th.
[03:09:22.829 --> 03:09:29.652]  And yes, they have male basses are experiencing unwanted sex changes.
[03:09:29.652 --> 03:09:35.454]  Okay, they say male bass are experiencing unwanted sex changes apparently due to chemical soups.
[03:09:35.894 --> 03:09:36.415]  We're good to go.
[03:09:53.736 --> 03:09:55.637]  Well, it's just so unbelievable.
[03:09:55.637 --> 03:09:56.518]  Yeah, exactly.
[03:09:56.518 --> 03:09:59.780]  Okay, so, and of course, what is it that's causing this with them?
[03:09:59.780 --> 03:10:02.901]  Well, it's the same stuff that we're exposed to, right?
[03:10:02.901 --> 03:10:05.983]  They say it's a problem everywhere.
[03:10:05.983 --> 03:10:16.369]  It's coming from birth control pills, from pesticides, from hormones and livestock manure, other chemical-heavy products, and of course, it's also the BPA, the plastics that are in the water.
[03:10:16.369 --> 03:10:22.573]  The Washington Post story breaks it down and says, hey, this isn't limited just to these urban areas, it's not just the
[03:10:22.953 --> 03:10:26.555]  Metrosexual bass, I guess you could call them, okay?
[03:10:26.555 --> 03:10:30.277]  This is also happening in rural areas, but it's also happening in Japan.
[03:10:30.277 --> 03:10:35.780]  And they say that studies have been done there on medaka fish, if I'm pronouncing that correctly.
[03:10:35.780 --> 03:10:45.185]  They say that species reproduces very quickly, so they like to use them in tests because they reproduce more quickly than the smallmouth bass do.
[03:10:45.185 --> 03:10:46.586]  That's the issue though, okay?
[03:10:46.586 --> 03:10:47.987]  And so when Rachel Maddow
[03:10:49.170 --> 03:10:50.931]  Starts making fun of Alex Jones for that.
[03:10:50.931 --> 03:10:55.235]  We need to have her checked and see if Chris Hayes is ovulating.
[03:10:55.235 --> 03:10:58.317]  Because, you know, that's essentially where this is all going.
[03:10:58.317 --> 03:10:59.798]  All right, enough of that.
[03:10:59.798 --> 03:11:02.901]  Let's go to what's happening with Obama and the executive orders.
[03:11:02.901 --> 03:11:04.182]  And we're going to play some clips.
[03:11:04.182 --> 03:11:06.123]  We're going to show you some statistics.
[03:11:06.123 --> 03:11:08.565]  We've got a chart that is set up here.
[03:11:08.565 --> 03:11:10.227]  You think that there's not any background checks?
[03:11:10.227 --> 03:11:11.768]  Yeah, there's a lot of background checks being made.
[03:11:12.348 --> 03:11:14.169]  But first of all, let's talk about executive orders.
[03:11:14.169 --> 03:11:16.511]  And I want to give you a little bit of a background about this.
[03:11:16.511 --> 03:11:20.933]  We hear people talking about Obama's executive orders.
[03:11:20.933 --> 03:11:23.375]  He's not the first person to do this, of course.
[03:11:23.375 --> 03:11:25.916]  And he's not the person who has done the most.
[03:11:25.916 --> 03:11:29.578]  Of course, FDR did over 3,500 executive orders.
[03:11:29.578 --> 03:11:31.419]  And some of them were major executive orders.
[03:11:31.419 --> 03:11:36.683]  He was really reconfiguring the country in a way that Obama hopes to do as well.
[03:11:37.463 --> 03:11:39.444]  Things like gold prohibition.
[03:11:39.444 --> 03:11:41.305]  FDR did that, just by executive order.
[03:11:41.305 --> 03:11:42.826]  He said, I'm going to prohibit gold.
[03:11:42.826 --> 03:11:45.867]  And I remember Minkin, who was a commentator, H.L.
[03:11:45.867 --> 03:11:54.311]  Minkin, said, well, you know, a year ago, if I had a flask of whiskey in my pocket, I was violating the law, but the gold coin that I had was okay.
[03:11:54.311 --> 03:11:56.372]  Now this year, it's gone the other way around.
[03:11:56.372 --> 03:11:59.634]  They got rid of alcohol prohibition, and then they prohibited gold.
[03:11:59.634 --> 03:12:04.756]  He also did, by executive order, Japanese and German concentration camps here in America.
[03:12:04.756 --> 03:12:05.837]  That was an executive order.
[03:12:06.477 --> 03:12:10.639]  He also created the Export-Import Bank that we're still suffering under.
[03:12:10.639 --> 03:12:12.260]  We had Lincoln.
[03:12:12.260 --> 03:12:16.161]  Going back to that, the Emancipation Proclamation, for example, was an executive order.
[03:12:16.161 --> 03:12:22.644]  Now you may say that's a good thing, but we have to understand that was a gimmick that actually freed no one.
[03:12:22.644 --> 03:12:30.328]  It listed the states that were still in rebellion and freed the slaves that were there, even though there were some states, border states and others, that still had slavery.
[03:12:31.108 --> 03:12:43.242]  General Grant, General Ulysses Grant, kept his slaves until they were outlawed after the war with the 14th Amendment, with some states specifically outlawing it even before the 14th Amendment.
[03:12:43.242 --> 03:12:46.346]  But Abraham Lincoln didn't free a single slave, but what he did do
[03:12:46.986 --> 03:12:51.310]  Was he did repeal habeas corpus by executive order.
[03:12:51.310 --> 03:12:54.734]  We have Bill Clinton, he waged the Kosovo war with executive order.
[03:12:54.734 --> 03:13:05.865]  We have George W. Bush, he called, he stopped all public access to presidential information and that was overturned by Obama when he took order.
[03:13:05.865 --> 03:13:10.949]  But what is the, what is the parameters where they can stop executive order?
[03:13:11.690 --> 03:13:14.131]  Truman hit the limit, okay?
[03:13:14.131 --> 03:13:17.893]  Truman went to try to nationalize the steel mills.
[03:13:17.893 --> 03:13:24.857]  Now, they were in the middle of a labor dispute, it was the Korean War, and he was concerned about the source of steel being shut down.
[03:13:24.857 --> 03:13:32.682]  So, when he couldn't get them to work together, the labor unions and the people who own the steel mills, he said, well, we're just going to take over the steel mills.
[03:13:33.542 --> 03:13:40.726]  And the steel mill owners immediately sued, and that resulted in a Supreme Court case, the Youngstown decision.
[03:13:40.726 --> 03:13:42.827]  And this is what one of the justices said.
[03:13:42.827 --> 03:13:48.210]  He said, well, they overturned that decision because they said, you don't really have the power to do that.
[03:13:48.210 --> 03:13:51.872]  You don't have the power to just be a dictator.
[03:13:51.872 --> 03:13:53.593]  And they said, here's the three tests.
[03:13:53.593 --> 03:13:57.035]  Number one, the president acts with most authority, and this is written in the
[03:13:58.718 --> 03:14:01.599]  Majority opinion by the Supreme Court Justice Robert H. Jackson.
[03:14:01.599 --> 03:14:07.581]  He said the President acts with the most authority when he has the express or implied consent of Congress.
[03:14:07.581 --> 03:14:09.222]  Is that the case right here?
[03:14:09.222 --> 03:14:10.182]  We're going to play a clip for you.
[03:14:10.182 --> 03:14:19.305]  Let's play this clip of Obama's press secretary, Josh Earnest, talking about why Obama did this executive order on guns.
[03:14:20.376 --> 03:14:35.798]  I would anticipate that the president will have an announcement quite soon where he will discuss some steps that his administration has concluded and that he has concluded are within his executive authority that would keep guns out of the hands of people who shouldn't have them.
[03:14:37.077 --> 03:14:37.377]  I think?
[03:14:57.048 --> 03:15:02.329]  More than 30,000 Americans who die every year as a result of a gun.
[03:15:02.329 --> 03:15:04.550]  Okay, let's hold it right there.
[03:15:04.550 --> 03:15:05.330]  That's the key thing.
[03:15:05.330 --> 03:15:06.650]  You've heard this before.
[03:15:06.650 --> 03:15:07.931]  We've all heard this before, right?
[03:15:07.931 --> 03:15:08.851]  Yes.
[03:15:08.851 --> 03:15:12.652]  The President has to do something because Congress doesn't want to.
[03:15:12.652 --> 03:15:13.872]  Okay?
[03:15:13.872 --> 03:15:16.353]  Congress has blocked what he wants to have happen.
[03:15:16.353 --> 03:15:24.795]  Well, the President, the Supreme Court said, back in the Youngstown decision, said the President has the most authority when he has the express or implied consent of Congress.
[03:15:25.655 --> 03:15:29.097]  He is clearly acting against their direct wishes.
[03:15:29.097 --> 03:15:32.058]  They say he has uncertain authority if they've been silent.
[03:15:32.058 --> 03:15:35.620]  And of course, it was kind of interesting, he called it a zone of twilight.
[03:15:35.620 --> 03:15:39.042]  Not the twilight zone, because this is the 50s, this is before the series.
[03:15:39.042 --> 03:15:47.066]  But yeah, we are entering the twilight zone because we've got a president who, according to the Supreme Court decision, says has the least authority.
[03:15:47.426 --> 03:15:51.989]  When he's doing things that are incompatible with the express or implied will of Congress.
[03:15:51.989 --> 03:15:57.854]  Such an act, wrote Justice Jackson, threatens the equilibrium established by our constitutional system.
[03:15:57.854 --> 03:16:00.396]  Yes, he becomes a dictator, doesn't he, Ja'kari Jackson?
[03:16:01.052 --> 03:16:07.655]  Well, you know, we were watching these clips of the President and he's, you know, listing all the victims and all the shootings and all this.
[03:16:07.655 --> 03:16:10.317]  He didn't mention Border Patrol Agent Brian Terry.
[03:16:10.317 --> 03:16:12.818]  He doesn't mention the people that are killed by the cartels being armed.
[03:16:12.818 --> 03:16:18.100]  He doesn't mention the people who are being killed by ISIS and Al-Qaeda who were dropping grenades and giving funding to.
[03:16:18.100 --> 03:16:23.483]  He doesn't mention the people who are killed when drone strikes and jets blow up hospitals and wedding parties.
[03:16:23.803 --> 03:16:25.985]  He doesn't mention anything about these people.
[03:16:25.985 --> 03:16:33.352]  And even when he was mentioning Chicago, at the end of his speech he kind of glossed over throughout Chicago, he didn't mention that Chicago was a gun-free zone.
[03:16:33.352 --> 03:16:34.693]  Oh yeah, the airport.
[03:16:34.693 --> 03:16:42.921]  Yeah, and in the city of Chicago now they're saying that the police officers at the airport are supposed to run away from the active shooter, not actually engage the active shooter.
[03:16:43.001 --> 03:16:47.725]  And these are not rent-a-cops, these are not TSA, these are sworn law officers, okay?
[03:16:47.725 --> 03:16:56.712]  They have police uniforms, police badges, I mean, they're legitimate cops, but they take away their guns because they want the airport to be a gun-free zone.
[03:16:56.712 --> 03:16:58.133]  How's that gonna work?
[03:16:58.133 --> 03:17:05.079]  When you guys, a couple of guys, drive up with AK-47s and hand grenades like they did at that church in South Africa,
[03:17:05.399 --> 03:17:08.702]  And just start spraying and hurling grenades.
[03:17:08.702 --> 03:17:10.584]  I mean, you had one guy in that church.
[03:17:10.584 --> 03:17:12.125]  They knew it was a gun-free zone.
[03:17:12.125 --> 03:17:13.566]  They knew it was a liberal church.
[03:17:13.566 --> 03:17:16.789]  They knew it had over a thousand people in it, so they were going to attack it.
[03:17:16.789 --> 03:17:21.994]  And they went into that church, and they didn't realize that that day, one guy was visiting.
[03:17:22.614 --> 03:17:23.815]  With a concealed carry.
[03:17:23.815 --> 03:17:25.416]  And he wasn't even a member of that church.
[03:17:25.416 --> 03:17:29.559]  And with a small revolver with only five shots.
[03:17:29.559 --> 03:17:34.482]  And he was all the way across the church open area there where they came in.
[03:17:34.482 --> 03:17:36.083]  He got down underneath, took a couple of shots.
[03:17:36.083 --> 03:17:37.444]  I'm never going to hit him from here.
[03:17:37.444 --> 03:17:39.825]  Went around the backside, took another couple of shots.
[03:17:39.825 --> 03:17:41.587]  They thought there were multiple shooters.
[03:17:41.587 --> 03:17:47.210]  He had hit one of them with that shot all the way catty-corner across the sanctuary, the auditorium or whatever.
[03:17:47.210 --> 03:17:47.951]  And they fled.
[03:17:48.351 --> 03:17:56.497]  And they said after they had the truth and reconciliation, after everything came together in South Africa, they said their intention was to kill everyone in that church.
[03:17:56.497 --> 03:18:01.080]  And they killed quite a few people because they threw hand grenades in first and started spraying the crowd.
[03:18:01.080 --> 03:18:01.841]  Yes.
[03:18:01.841 --> 03:18:02.161]  Absolutely.
[03:18:02.161 --> 03:18:10.607]  That's what's going to happen at the airport if somebody gets serious about this because even the police, they're telling, run and hide because we're not going to let you protect yourself or protect others.
[03:18:11.337 --> 03:18:17.341]  And I mean, all this quote, reasonable regulations that he's pushing through, you know, all the background checks.
[03:18:17.341 --> 03:18:20.724]  Can we have that background check graphic, guys, so we can show the people?
[03:18:20.724 --> 03:18:25.307]  And we'll read this for the people who are listening on the radio.
[03:18:25.307 --> 03:18:28.730]  We heard consistently, you know, there's not enough background checks going on.
[03:18:28.730 --> 03:18:33.393]  If you go to InfoWars.com forward slash show, you can see the totals of background checks in 2014 to 2015.
[03:18:33.393 --> 03:18:34.214]  In just one state in 2014,
[03:18:37.476 --> 03:18:41.860]  Kentucky had 2.4, I guess 2.5 million background checks.
[03:18:41.860 --> 03:18:44.362]  This year Kentucky had 3.2 million.
[03:18:44.362 --> 03:18:50.648]  With a grand total for the nation of 23 million, about 23 million background checks.
[03:18:50.648 --> 03:18:52.509]  And that's all 50 states for the year of 2015.
[03:18:54.133 --> 03:19:01.720]  And of course, we just had the Attorney General in Virginia say that they're not going to recognize concealed carry permits from all these different states.
[03:19:01.720 --> 03:19:03.161]  Kentucky was one of them.
[03:19:03.161 --> 03:19:07.585]  And he said, we're not going to recognize because we don't think that they do it stringently enough.
[03:19:07.585 --> 03:19:11.929]  They do all the checks on their concealed carry people on a monthly basis.
[03:19:11.929 --> 03:19:19.797]  They make sure that they still haven't committed a crime, that they're not under indictment, etc., etc., that they're, you know, not under protection orders for domestic violence.
[03:19:20.077 --> 03:19:20.337]  That's right.
[03:19:42.128 --> 03:19:43.329]  But of course, that's already failed.
[03:19:43.329 --> 03:19:46.310]  They already tried and failed to do that in the New York Safe Act.
[03:19:46.310 --> 03:19:46.991]  Stay with us.
[03:19:46.991 --> 03:19:48.412]  We're going to be right back with Jakari Jackson.
[03:19:48.412 --> 03:19:56.916]  We're going to break down this massive attack on your freedoms and why everyone should be concerned about this, even if you don't like guns, even if you're afraid of them.
[03:19:56.916 --> 03:19:57.277]  Stay with us.
[03:19:57.277 --> 03:19:57.797]  We'll be right back.
[03:19:59.522 --> 03:20:03.143]  Winter has just begun, and are you already tired of being cold?
[03:20:03.143 --> 03:20:05.504]  How would you like to never be cold again?

[03:24:12.262 --> 03:24:13.563]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:24:13.563 --> 03:24:15.145]  I'm David Knight here with Jakari Jackson.
[03:24:15.145 --> 03:24:23.013]  We're going to break down some of the details, a little bit more detail, about what Obama is proposing and some of the reactions against it and our comments about it.
[03:24:23.013 --> 03:24:29.179]  Before we do, real quickly, I want to thank everybody who supported InfoWars, buying our products, especially over the holidays.
[03:24:29.179 --> 03:24:30.520]  I hope you had a happy holiday.
[03:24:30.520 --> 03:24:36.466]  And we offer these specials to you both before Christmas and now after Christmas as a way of saying thank you.
[03:24:37.086 --> 03:24:39.369]  It is something that Alex chose to do.
[03:24:39.369 --> 03:24:53.285]  The way he chose to fund the organization is to not be beholding to outside advertisers, but to offer something to our customers, to our listeners, that would be a win-win situation.
[03:24:53.285 --> 03:24:55.367]  Something that will help you with your health.
[03:24:55.968 --> 03:25:01.912]  Done at a good price, and then frequently he does these specials to give you an added bonus here.

[03:25:52.493 --> 03:25:57.356]  Thank you for supporting us, and we hope that this is going to be a win-win situation for everybody.
[03:25:57.356 --> 03:26:02.018]  Well, for these kind of discounts, and it's the way we finance and run this organization.
[03:26:02.018 --> 03:26:15.647]  Alright, Jakari, as we're looking at this, one of the things that really, I guess today as I'm looking at all the rhetoric, that really stuck out to me is this continual mantra about the gun lobby this, the gun lobby that, the gun lobby this.
[03:26:16.274 --> 03:26:18.855]  And I'm looking at that, and I think, you know what?
[03:26:18.855 --> 03:26:20.215]  What is the gun lobby?
[03:26:20.215 --> 03:26:28.077]  Well, the gun lobby is things like the NRA, or Gun Owners of America, or individuals, okay, who are supporting them, alright?
[03:26:28.077 --> 03:26:30.578]  It's really democracy in action.
[03:26:30.578 --> 03:26:38.039]  Because we've got in the marketplace, as you're just looking at all this explosion of background checks, you know that Obama has sold more guns than anybody else, okay?
[03:26:38.039 --> 03:26:40.000]  It's the world's best gun salesman.
[03:26:40.000 --> 03:26:42.981]  People are voting with their pocketbook in the marketplace.
[03:26:42.981 --> 03:26:44.221]  They say, we want guns.
[03:26:44.841 --> 03:26:50.226]  And that's the thing, David, because we always hear 9 out of 10 Americans want, you know, fewer guns on the street.
[03:26:50.226 --> 03:26:51.347]  They want more background checks.
[03:26:51.347 --> 03:26:52.147]  That's not true.
[03:26:52.147 --> 03:26:58.933]  I don't see that because every time, every year, every year, every Black Friday, every Christmas, every whatever, people go out and buy guns.
[03:26:58.933 --> 03:26:59.574]  It's record numbers.
[03:26:59.574 --> 03:27:01.115]  You can see the FBI's own numbers for that.
[03:27:01.115 --> 03:27:01.916]  And it's new gun owners.
[03:27:02.456 --> 03:27:09.042]  And we're seeing that as gun ownership expands, and in the areas where we have it, we've mentioned this so many times, but I'll say it one more time.
[03:27:09.042 --> 03:27:13.286]  When people have guns, crime goes down, and we've seen that many, many times.
[03:27:13.286 --> 03:27:16.628]  So people are speaking out in the marketplace, and they're making their choices.
[03:27:16.628 --> 03:27:18.370]  They're voting in the marketplace.
[03:27:18.370 --> 03:27:22.093]  They're also voting with their dollars in the marketplace of ideas.
[03:27:22.093 --> 03:27:26.757]  That's why you have an organization like the NRA, or an organization like Gun Owners of America.
[03:27:26.757 --> 03:27:28.298]  It's because people are voting
[03:27:29.039 --> 03:27:29.859]  We're good to go.
[03:27:44.525 --> 03:27:48.390]  It should override what our elected representatives want to do in Congress.
[03:27:48.390 --> 03:27:51.113]  It should override our wishes in the marketplace.
[03:27:51.113 --> 03:27:55.738]  It should override our wishes in the marketplace of ideas when we support these organizations.
[03:27:55.738 --> 03:28:02.346]  So when they say, the gun lobby this, the gun lobby that, just understand they don't like the fact that you have a say in this.
[03:28:02.346 --> 03:28:04.629]  They want Obama to be the only one who has a say in this.
[03:28:05.109 --> 03:28:11.133]  Yes, and one of the things that he's had to say about, he's talking about the smart guns, guys, if we can ready clip number three.
[03:28:11.133 --> 03:28:14.316]  And he wants to have fingerprint activation and also GPS tracking.
[03:28:14.316 --> 03:28:22.261]  Now, on the surface, for this reasonable gun control, people say, well, why don't you want to have a smart gun that has a fingerprint scanner?
[03:28:22.261 --> 03:28:23.322]  A child won't be able to use it.
[03:28:23.322 --> 03:28:27.385]  I did a story a couple years back called Smart Guns Endanger Children.
[03:28:27.665 --> 03:28:31.047]  And this is, it was all about children using guns when they were home alone.
[03:28:31.047 --> 03:28:40.033]  You know, a 12-year-old girl in Oklahoma back in 2012, some guy breaks into the house, she pulls out the gun, that was in her mother's name, but she knew how to use it, opened fire and shot the intruder.
[03:28:40.033 --> 03:28:44.195]  A young boy in Houston, 15 years old, pulled out his father's AR-15, shot the intruder.
[03:28:44.195 --> 03:28:46.577]  Daddy wasn't home, the boy was able to protect himself.
[03:28:46.977 --> 03:28:57.165]  And of course as you well know, Jakari, the more safeties you've got on a gun, the more likely it is in a pressure situation where somebody's got the drop on you that you're not going to be able to use it to protect yourself.
[03:28:57.165 --> 03:28:57.325]  Oh yeah.
[03:28:57.325 --> 03:29:01.729]  So there's one more thing that can go wrong, one more step that you have to take in a vital situation.
[03:29:01.729 --> 03:29:11.777]  There was a recent, just happened over the holidays, an armed robber comes up behind a guy and sticks a gun in his back and says, turn around and empty your pockets.
[03:29:11.777 --> 03:29:14.399]  Well the guy had a gun in his pocket, so he did empty his pockets.
[03:29:15.960 --> 03:29:21.384]  It's kind of like the True Grit, you know, where he says, fill your hands, you son of a gun.
[03:29:21.384 --> 03:29:25.106]  So he turned around, had a gun in his hand, and he killed the guy.
[03:29:25.106 --> 03:29:29.129]  Now that's going to be counted as a death by firearm.
[03:29:29.129 --> 03:29:29.970]  Is that a problem?
[03:29:29.970 --> 03:29:35.393]  I mean, this guy, maybe he, you know, he wouldn't have killed this individual he was robbing.
[03:29:35.393 --> 03:29:38.816]  Maybe he would have robbed many, many other people with an armed robbery.
[03:29:38.816 --> 03:29:42.158]  And eventually somebody would have done something that didn't have a gun, he probably would have killed them.
[03:29:42.378 --> 03:29:48.368]  Stay with us, we're going to be right back with Jakari Jackson to talk about this gun control by Executive Fiat.
[03:29:48.368 --> 03:29:52.314]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[03:29:52.314 --> 03:29:54.978]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:29:59.554 --> 03:30:11.024]  Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid wants the Federal Election Commission to make an exemption and allow him to pocket over $600,000 for retirement from a slush fund.
[03:30:11.024 --> 03:30:15.669]  FEC guidelines prohibit personal use of unspent PAC and campaign money.
[03:30:16.269 --> 03:30:22.873]  Punishment for violating the prohibition on personal use ranges from hefty fines to possible imprisonment.
[03:30:22.873 --> 03:30:28.656]  The money can be used as a contribution to charity or donated to the National Party Committee.
[03:30:28.656 --> 03:30:31.137]  Democrat FEC Chairwoman Anne Ravel.
[03:30:31.417 --> 03:30:39.939]  Believes Reed has the right to the money due to his status as a, quote, historic and important figure and public official, end quote.
[03:30:39.939 --> 03:30:43.800]  The FEC has deferred action on Reed's request.
[03:30:43.800 --> 03:30:50.861]  FEC Commissioner Lee E. Goodman believes granting the request will send the wrong message and set a precedent.
[03:30:50.861 --> 03:30:54.782]  You can find more reports on InfoWars.com.
[03:30:58.826 --> 03:31:02.368]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.

[03:31:43.798 --> 03:31:45.499]  Ultimately, we've all been dumbed down to some degree.

[03:33:21.264 --> 03:33:22.804]  I'm David Knight here with Jakari Jackson.
[03:33:22.804 --> 03:33:26.566]  We're taking a look at Obama's moves on gun control.
[03:33:26.566 --> 03:33:39.131]  And quite frankly, regardless of where you are on gun control, I think you should be very concerned about the fact that we have a, I would call it a rump Congress, because they're nothing but a little stump of what it should be.
[03:33:39.131 --> 03:33:44.334]  They've abdicated all their power to both the President and to these bureaucracies, which as we see
[03:33:45.114 --> 03:33:49.135]  Every week we have another massive power grab by some bureaucracy.
[03:33:49.135 --> 03:33:54.217]  Whether it's the FAA telling people you've got to register your half pound up drones or get... Paper airplane?
[03:33:54.217 --> 03:33:55.377]  Yeah, exactly.
[03:33:55.377 --> 03:33:58.558]  Register your paper airplane or you're going to get fined $27,500.
[03:34:00.799 --> 03:34:13.594]  You've got the EPA saying we now control all water and they come after a guy in Montana with eight acres who builds this little pond inside of his property for his livestock and his kids and say $37,000 a day fine.
[03:34:13.594 --> 03:34:15.716]  That's something that's still about to roll out.
[03:34:15.776 --> 03:34:28.092]  So every day we see these kinds of outrages, these kinds of power grabs, over-the-top unconstitutional actions by these government bureaucracies, and this happens because Congress has abdicated its power to these bureaucracies.
[03:34:28.092 --> 03:34:33.639]  They're all these little fiefdoms looking to expand their power base, and there are no checks on them.
[03:34:34.099 --> 03:34:44.385]  They have become legislatures, they have become their own police, and their own courts, because in most cases they do these as civil actions, so you don't have a day in court.
[03:34:44.385 --> 03:34:50.428]  In many cases they just assess you the fine, they take your money like that not registering your paper airplane, okay?
[03:34:50.428 --> 03:34:54.931]  They can fine you $27,000, you don't get a day in court, okay?
[03:34:54.931 --> 03:34:57.933]  They don't charge you, it's like civil asset forfeiture under the drug war.
[03:34:58.453 --> 03:34:59.574]  They don't charge you with a crime.
[03:34:59.574 --> 03:35:00.554]  They don't find you guilty.
[03:35:00.554 --> 03:35:02.456]  They just take your property.
[03:35:02.456 --> 03:35:03.296]  Just take your money.
[03:35:03.296 --> 03:35:05.057]  And so that's what we're seeing over and over again.
[03:35:05.057 --> 03:35:06.659]  And that's a key part of this.
[03:35:06.659 --> 03:35:12.382]  This is the tactic that Obama is using to say, well, these are just going to be rules, OK?
[03:35:12.382 --> 03:35:15.384]  This is legislation without representation.
[03:35:15.384 --> 03:35:16.205]  Let's understand it.
[03:35:16.205 --> 03:35:21.148]  It's gotten to that point that we need to understand this is not only legislation without representation.
[03:35:21.148 --> 03:35:28.253]  We're back to taxation without representation when they can assess these fines as civil penalties and you don't get a day in court.
[03:35:28.933 --> 03:35:30.133]  So it's very, very dangerous.
[03:35:30.133 --> 03:35:34.175]  But let's go to this particular clip on smart guns, Ja'Kari.
[03:35:34.175 --> 03:35:35.355]  Yes, let's go ahead and roll the clip.
[03:35:35.355 --> 03:35:41.336]  It's Obama talking about smart guns and how he wants to have fingerprint activation to use a firearm.
[03:35:41.336 --> 03:35:44.477]  We're going to boost gun safety technology.
[03:35:44.477 --> 03:35:50.699]  Today, many gun injuries and deaths are the result of legal guns that were stolen or misused or discharged accidentally.
[03:35:52.609 --> 03:36:01.132]  In 2013 alone, more than 500 people lost their lives to gun accidents, and that includes 30 children younger than 5 years old.
[03:36:01.132 --> 03:36:07.833]  In the greatest, most technologically advanced nation on earth, there is no reason for this.
[03:36:07.833 --> 03:36:11.514]  We need to develop new technologies that make guns safer.
[03:36:11.514 --> 03:36:16.956]  If we can set it up so you can't unlock your phone unless you got the right fingerprint,
[03:36:20.518 --> 03:36:24.041]  Why can't we do the same thing for our guns?
[03:36:24.041 --> 03:36:25.382]  Yeah, great.
[03:36:25.382 --> 03:36:32.288]  Let's treat everybody as if they're a convicted drunk driver and they've got to pass a breathalyzer test to turn on their car.
[03:36:32.288 --> 03:36:38.413]  That can help us find a missing tablet, which happens to me often.
[03:36:38.413 --> 03:36:45.659]  The older I get.
[03:36:45.659 --> 03:36:46.420]  If we can do it for
[03:36:47.617 --> 03:36:52.179]  Your iPad, there's no reason we can't do it with a stolen gun.
[03:36:52.179 --> 03:36:55.640]  If a child can't open a bottle of aspirin... Yeah, let's go ahead and stop the clip there.
[03:36:55.640 --> 03:37:00.781]  Yeah, when he's talking about GPS tracking, he's like, hey, sometimes I lose my iPad and I need GPS tracking to find it.
[03:37:00.781 --> 03:37:03.462]  It's like, oh yeah, where'd I put that 38?
[03:37:03.462 --> 03:37:04.162]  I can't find it.
[03:37:04.162 --> 03:37:08.484]  Let me... Yeah, and that's one thing that Attorney General was talking about before he...
[03:37:09.164 --> 03:37:14.569]  He said, well let's have some type of bracelet or some other thing to where people can't use the gun unless they're right there.
[03:37:14.569 --> 03:37:20.134]  And I mean, it's going to happen, you know, if they make this nationwide, it's going to, unfortunately, it's going to happen.
[03:37:20.134 --> 03:37:25.399]  An officer is going to reach for his gun, he's going to have some gloves on or some other thing, and he's not going to use his pistol.
[03:37:25.399 --> 03:37:27.541]  Oh, technology never fails, Jakari.
[03:37:27.541 --> 03:37:27.941]  Never fails.
[03:37:27.941 --> 03:37:30.464]  Just like the smart car never gets you a ticket or anything.
[03:37:30.464 --> 03:37:30.944]  That's right.
[03:37:30.944 --> 03:37:32.786]  Look, look, we understand where this is going.
[03:37:33.410 --> 03:37:38.042]  We know one of our big concerns about the government-controlled robot cars.
[03:37:38.042 --> 03:37:40.508]  Let's just understand that it's going to be the government that's going to be controlling them.
[03:37:40.508 --> 03:37:42.474]  They can shut down your transportation just like that.
[03:37:43.132 --> 03:37:45.272]  With this, they'll be able to track you anywhere they want.
[03:37:45.272 --> 03:37:47.373]  They'll be able to turn off your guns remotely.
[03:37:47.373 --> 03:37:48.313]  And not just the government.
[03:37:48.313 --> 03:37:51.034]  Hackers will be able to mess with your guns, okay?
[03:37:51.034 --> 03:37:51.794]  And turn them off.
[03:37:51.794 --> 03:37:53.634]  And it is another level of safety.
[03:37:53.634 --> 03:37:56.115]  But this is something they're really going to push.
[03:37:56.115 --> 03:38:01.316]  Listen to what he said in his... This is the White House talking about what they're going to do.
[03:38:01.316 --> 03:38:05.577]  He says, they're going to review the availability of smart gun technology on a regular basis.
[03:38:06.277 --> 03:38:12.240]  They're going to explore potential ways to further its use and development to more broadly improve gun safety.
[03:38:12.240 --> 03:38:20.165]  Well, they're going to embark on a research program to come up with this stuff and then force you to use that.
[03:38:20.165 --> 03:38:25.568]  They're also going to set up an internet investigation center to track illegal online firearms tracking.
[03:38:26.368 --> 03:38:30.291]  They're moving some of this power, Jakari, from the FBI to the ATF.
[03:38:30.291 --> 03:38:33.533]  Background checks, they're moving some of that to the ATF.
[03:38:33.533 --> 03:38:44.461]  This Internet Investigation Center, another agency to spy on you on the Internet, OK, without a search warrant, they're going to be transferring that to the ATF instead of the FBI.
[03:38:44.461 --> 03:38:47.904]  I guess the FBI is a little bit too concerned about the Constitution.
[03:38:47.904 --> 03:38:49.225]  They don't have that problem with the BATF.
[03:38:50.965 --> 03:38:52.946]  Yeah, I guess that's a good way to put it.
[03:38:52.946 --> 03:38:56.547]  Now, there's another thing that he talked about in clip number two, guys, if we can get that ready.
[03:38:56.547 --> 03:39:02.068]  When he was talking about gun trust, you may recall, David, Joe Biggs and myself, we did that report.
[03:39:02.068 --> 03:39:06.890]  We went out to the silencer shop here in Austin, Texas, and one of the things that they were talking about, you could use a trust.
[03:39:07.990 --> 03:39:08.650]  That's common sense to me.
[03:39:33.163 --> 03:39:33.823]  Yeah, absolutely.
[03:39:33.823 --> 03:39:41.648]  Well, you know, this ammunition law that was put in, out in, they're trying to float this out in New York.
[03:39:41.648 --> 03:39:51.973]  The two women who did this in the State House and the State Senate, they wanted to limit your ammunition purchases to twice the capacity of your firearm during a three-month period.
[03:39:51.973 --> 03:39:58.616]  So if they do that, if they were successful in doing that, that would mean that you would not be able to practice with it so that you had real gun control.
[03:39:58.616 --> 03:39:59.277]  Okay?
[03:39:59.277 --> 03:40:00.577]  So that you could really hit what you were shooting.
[03:40:00.577 --> 03:40:01.518]  Gun control is using both hands.
[03:40:01.658 --> 03:40:02.639]  That's right, that's right.
[03:40:02.639 --> 03:40:04.720]  And of course they point out that this has already failed.
[03:40:04.720 --> 03:40:09.925]  They had a provision for that in the SAFE Act that was passed in New York State.
[03:40:09.925 --> 03:40:16.230]  And they were very embarrassed when Governor Cuomo realized that he didn't have any way to implement that.
[03:40:16.230 --> 03:40:19.652]  And then it was also overturned in federal district court in New York.
[03:40:19.652 --> 03:40:23.916]  They said it was unconstitutional to regulate how many rounds a person could have.
[03:40:23.916 --> 03:40:29.400]  But that doesn't phase Roxanne and Joanne, the two legislators who are pushing
[03:40:30.120 --> 03:40:31.561]  They're going to still try to do that again.
[03:40:31.561 --> 03:40:34.962]  And understand, they are going to try to control ammunition.
[03:40:34.962 --> 03:40:37.263]  He doesn't talk about that, but that's one of the key things.
[03:40:37.263 --> 03:40:42.024]  Because if they can get a hold of your ammunition, then your gun becomes a club.
[03:40:42.024 --> 03:40:42.424]  Absolutely.
[03:40:42.424 --> 03:40:46.226]  Let's go ahead and run that clip about targeting the gun trust.
[03:40:46.226 --> 03:40:56.489]  We're also expanding background checks to cover violent criminals who try to buy some of the most dangerous firearms by hiding behind trusts and corporations and various cutouts.
[03:40:59.835 --> 03:41:05.501]  We're also taking steps to make the background check system more efficient.
[03:41:05.501 --> 03:41:22.137]  Under the guidance of Jim Comey and the FBI, and our Deputy Director, Tom Brandon, ATF, we're going to hire more folks to process applications faster, and we're going to bring an outdated background check system into the 21st century.
[03:41:26.710 --> 03:41:27.890]  So there you go.
[03:41:27.890 --> 03:41:29.051]  Let's get rid of the gun trust.
[03:41:29.051 --> 03:41:36.153]  And as you said, David, you know, some violent felon isn't going to go through the process of trying to get into a trust in the first place.
[03:41:36.153 --> 03:41:36.753]  That's right.
[03:41:36.753 --> 03:41:37.333]  That's right.
[03:41:37.333 --> 03:41:46.315]  It's a very, you know, really, are the typical street criminals, are they going to go through all the hassle of trying to set up a gun trust?
[03:41:46.315 --> 03:41:48.136]  That's the absurdity of all of this stuff.
[03:41:48.136 --> 03:41:48.276]  Yes.
[03:41:48.496 --> 03:41:57.179]  The fact that if you're going to be engaged in a criminal activity, the last thing you're going to do is go buy a gun at a retail facility, okay?
[03:41:57.179 --> 03:42:10.243]  And if they're going to crack down on that, I can just imagine that the armed robbers and the armed terrorists are going to say, you know, well, we're going to have to put off our heist here, or we're going to have to put off the terrorist event because they were out of ammunition at Walmart.
[03:42:10.703 --> 03:42:13.165]  You know, they were out of AK-47s or whatever.
[03:42:13.165 --> 03:42:16.208]  I mean, they don't use that.
[03:42:16.208 --> 03:42:18.910]  They're going to go through the black market, and the black market is going to be there.
[03:42:18.910 --> 03:42:25.896]  If we haven't learned anything from the war on drugs, can't we learn something from alcohol prohibition?
[03:42:26.917 --> 03:42:31.801]  When you prohibit something, you have a vibrant black market, okay?
[03:42:31.801 --> 03:42:35.143]  We have more access to drugs because of prohibition.
[03:42:35.143 --> 03:42:38.226]  I've talked to Law Enforcement Against Prohibition, that organization LEAP.
[03:42:38.226 --> 03:42:38.966]  They pointed that out.
[03:42:38.966 --> 03:42:42.269]  It's like it actually makes it more readily available.
[03:42:42.269 --> 03:42:45.211]  It increases the virility of whatever it is that you're trying to outlaw.
[03:42:45.211 --> 03:42:52.957]  So you're going to have much more dangerous forms of guns that are going to be more widely available as you continue to crack down on this.
[03:42:53.277 --> 03:42:56.898]  Yeah, and as far as we're talking about prohibition, go talk to a high school senior.
[03:42:56.898 --> 03:43:00.138]  It's easier for them to get some illegal drugs than it is to get a can of beer.
[03:43:00.138 --> 03:43:00.738]  That's right.
[03:43:00.738 --> 03:43:01.538]  Exactly.
[03:43:01.538 --> 03:43:02.058]  Exactly.
[03:43:02.058 --> 03:43:03.179]  That's the whole point.
[03:43:03.179 --> 03:43:08.760]  So if we can learn anything from this, can't we learn that prohibition is going to backfire on us?
[03:43:08.760 --> 03:43:12.320]  And that's what the people who are pushing for gun control need to understand that.
[03:43:12.320 --> 03:43:22.122]  They also need to understand that if you're going to support a process by which we have these agencies do whatever they wish, where the president can do whatever he wishes as a dictator,
[03:43:22.782 --> 03:43:26.386]  There's going to be somebody coming along eventually that you're not going to be happy with.
[03:43:26.386 --> 03:43:31.270]  And unfortunately, that's one of the reasons why the opposition party never shuts this down.
[03:43:31.270 --> 03:43:40.019]  The Democrats don't shut down a Republican when he makes bad executive orders, and the Republicans don't shut down Obama because they want that power themselves.
[03:43:40.019 --> 03:43:45.704]  And that ought to scare you more than the idea that your neighbor has a gun.
[03:43:45.704 --> 03:43:47.226]  That really ought to scare you a lot more than that.
[03:43:47.626 --> 03:43:48.126]  Absolutely.
[03:43:48.126 --> 03:43:49.607]  Now, let's play the next clip.
[03:43:49.607 --> 03:43:51.288]  Let's go to clip number one, guys.
[03:43:51.288 --> 03:43:57.451]  And this is Obama saying, anyone in the business of selling firearms must get a license and perform a background check.
[03:43:57.451 --> 03:44:03.795]  Now, this troubles me, David, because just as Kit was saying today when he's talking to Alex, that means if I sold you a firearm.
[03:44:04.335 --> 03:44:05.795]  You know, am I a licensed dealer?
[03:44:05.795 --> 03:44:12.377]  No, but I have the right as a United States citizen to sell you a firearm without any type of background check or having a license.
[03:44:12.377 --> 03:44:18.118]  Now, Obama referenced people selling firearms over the internet, FFL dealers, without any type of background checks.
[03:44:18.118 --> 03:44:27.300]  In my understanding, that's illegal activity for a FFL dealer to do that, but as private individuals, private citizens, we can perform an activity, a transaction right now if we wanted to.
[03:44:27.580 --> 03:44:31.003]  Well, if you're buying something over the internet, yeah, you can buy a gun over the internet.
[03:44:31.003 --> 03:44:37.870]  It has to be shipped to an FFL dealer, and he's going to do the same process on you as if you were buying it in his store.
[03:44:37.870 --> 03:44:39.251]  He will charge you a flat fee.
[03:44:39.251 --> 03:44:42.114]  Most cases around here it's like 25 bucks or whatever.
[03:44:42.114 --> 03:44:49.201]  He'll charge you that $25 over the price of what you paid for the gun on the internet, but it is coming through him.
[03:44:49.201 --> 03:44:52.024]  He's doing all the process as if he was selling you a gun retail.
[03:44:52.364 --> 03:45:06.692]  So, when they talk about they're going to set up this internet snitching agency and run it underneath the ATF, I mean, none of this stuff, none of these measures are relevant to any of the so-called situations that they've had.
[03:45:06.692 --> 03:45:07.132]  Okay?
[03:45:07.132 --> 03:45:10.274]  They say this is a reaction to this, they're going to stop this from happening.
[03:45:10.274 --> 03:45:11.895]  It's not going to make any difference whatsoever.
[03:45:12.515 --> 03:45:14.477]  Not to any of these specific cases.
[03:45:14.477 --> 03:45:21.463]  And he's doing this even though, as Kip Daniels pointed out, only 2% of the people support gun control as a top issue.
[03:45:21.463 --> 03:45:23.284]  I mean, just recently there was another poll.
[03:45:23.284 --> 03:45:28.549]  I believe it was 3% of the people in America saw climate change as a problem.
[03:45:28.549 --> 03:45:34.734]  So here's Obama, you know, he's going to go against 97 or 98% of the people constantly.
[03:45:34.734 --> 03:45:39.879]  And he's doing it, according to CNN, because he's gone through an emotional evolution.
[03:45:40.479 --> 03:45:54.427]  On one issue they say he gets into this deeply personally and that's the way they're selling this tearful... Let's cry for all the people in Syria and Yemen and Mexico who lost their lives because of your policies.
[03:45:54.427 --> 03:45:57.869]  Let's go ahead and run this clip from President Obama.
[03:45:57.869 --> 03:46:05.794]  Anybody in the business of selling firearms must get a license and conduct background checks or be subject to criminal prosecutions.
[03:46:10.009 --> 03:46:13.110]  Nothing has changed.
[03:46:13.110 --> 03:46:13.571]  Yeah, I know.
[03:46:13.571 --> 03:46:18.893]  I guess people don't know that that's the law already.
[03:46:18.893 --> 03:46:22.674]  It doesn't matter whether you're doing it over the internet or at a gun show.
[03:46:22.674 --> 03:46:26.276]  It's not where you do it, but what you do.
[03:46:28.533 --> 03:46:31.575]  And once again, they keep talking about this gun show loophole.
[03:46:31.575 --> 03:46:35.517]  I've purchased firearms at gun shows every single time I've gone through a background check.
[03:46:35.517 --> 03:46:36.498]  Yeah, yeah.
[03:46:36.498 --> 03:46:42.441]  So there's a mass of people who don't understand that last year we had 23 million background checks performed.
[03:46:42.441 --> 03:46:45.343]  They hear the speeches like this, they think everybody who goes to a gun show
[03:46:45.783 --> 03:46:50.007]  Or any place else just goes in their hands, got, you know, a couple hundred bucks and walks out with a firearm.
[03:46:50.007 --> 03:46:56.452]  Those people, they know that they have, you know, ATF and other guys who come into those facilities looking for those type of situations.
[03:46:56.452 --> 03:46:58.414]  Those guys at gun shows are very stringent.
[03:46:58.414 --> 03:46:59.454]  They want to check your ID.
[03:46:59.454 --> 03:47:06.060]  They call the FBI, the NICS system, whatever they have to do to make sure, to verify your identity before they hand you that firearm.
[03:47:06.300 --> 03:47:12.663]  Yeah, when I've been to gun shows, they've actually been more concerned about that kind of stuff than the people in the gun stores.
[03:47:12.663 --> 03:47:17.825]  Because, as you pointed out, they know there are people going around and trying to set them up for something.
[03:47:17.825 --> 03:47:19.886]  So that's clearly the case.
[03:47:19.886 --> 03:47:21.167]  Now, you know, it's just...
[03:47:22.007 --> 03:47:22.348]  I don't know.
[03:47:22.348 --> 03:47:27.571]  As we look at this, one of the things that people were concerned about was that he was going to outlaw a private sale transaction.
[03:47:27.571 --> 03:47:32.174]  Although, you and I, you sell a gun to me, or vice versa.
[03:47:32.174 --> 03:47:34.216]  They're saying that this does not cover that.
[03:47:34.216 --> 03:47:35.637]  That's what they're currently saying right now.
[03:47:35.637 --> 03:47:37.218]  But of course, he can easily change.
[03:47:37.218 --> 03:47:38.679]  He's establishing the precedent.
[03:47:39.079 --> 03:47:50.628]  That he can do whatever he wishes, regardless of what our elected representatives say, regardless of the will of the people, regardless of the Constitution that protects our individual rights, he can override any of this.
[03:47:50.628 --> 03:48:01.637]  So he's establishing a precedent, establishing a principle on this particular issue, that he can do whatever he wishes, because he's not happy with the Constitution or with Congress or with our wishes as a people.
[03:48:02.097 --> 03:48:15.060]  Yeah, even if that's not what the President is saying in this particular instance, we've seen multiple politicians from around the country in various offices saying that they would have, you have to go through a background check to sell a firearm to your son.
[03:48:15.060 --> 03:48:19.501]  You know, if you wanted to sell Travis a gun, you would have to go through some type of background check.
[03:48:19.501 --> 03:48:23.702]  So even if that's not what Obama's pushing right here, we also see several politicians
[03:48:24.844 --> 03:48:26.725]  Excuse me, who are ready to jump on that train.
[03:48:26.725 --> 03:48:27.365]  Exactly.
[03:48:27.365 --> 03:48:40.330]  And when we're looking at the gun trust issue again, that is a complicated legal structure that people will go through so that you can have multiple people using this, typically in a family, that are using this particular firearm.
[03:48:40.330 --> 03:48:45.872]  So they can't play this game of the gun is in this guy's hand as opposed to your hand.
[03:48:46.252 --> 03:48:53.219]  So they're going through a very detailed, very complicated structure here that still doesn't change anything about the way the gun is bought.
[03:48:53.219 --> 03:49:00.867]  You still have background checks regardless of whether it's going to be registered to one individual or whether it's being registered to a gun trust.
[03:49:00.867 --> 03:49:03.230]  It is still going through those background checks.
[03:49:03.610 --> 03:49:06.132]  Yeah, and that's the thing I don't think people understand.
[03:49:06.132 --> 03:49:09.655]  You know, they hear the rhetoric, but they just don't understand.
[03:49:09.655 --> 03:49:10.275]  They are concerned.
[03:49:10.275 --> 03:49:15.599]  I believe there are plenty of people out there who are legitimately concerned about the gun violence in this country.
[03:49:15.599 --> 03:49:22.404]  And like I said, I don't like to see the gun violence either, but people need to understand when you see these statistics of, you know, X number of people died in 2015.
[03:49:22.404 --> 03:49:24.126]  Those include suicides.
[03:49:24.126 --> 03:49:26.948]  People commit suicide by jumping in front of trains.
[03:49:27.108 --> 03:49:27.308]  Oh yeah.
[03:49:27.308 --> 03:49:28.388]  Jumping off buildings.
[03:49:28.388 --> 03:49:31.470]  A guy died accidentally, I believe in San Diego, taking a selfie.
[03:49:31.470 --> 03:49:33.971]  Are you going to outlaw a lot of people from taking selfies?
[03:49:33.971 --> 03:49:35.171]  Absolutely not.
[03:49:35.171 --> 03:49:37.132]  Also, people commit suicide.
[03:49:37.132 --> 03:49:39.193]  They get shot by police officers.
[03:49:39.193 --> 03:49:44.915]  Tell me, officer shootings, whether they be justified or unjustified, fall into that category as well.
[03:49:44.915 --> 03:49:50.337]  So when you see this all-consuming number, people just automatically assume they're all school shootings or they're all other things.
[03:49:50.337 --> 03:49:55.399]  No, sometimes it's a store clerk shooting a robber who comes into their establishment.
[03:49:56.087 --> 03:50:04.911]  Let's talk about this other aspect of this, and of course that is the snitch society that we're creating here in the United States, Snitches of America.
[03:50:04.911 --> 03:50:07.312]  We've seen this happen with CISA recently.
[03:50:07.312 --> 03:50:10.414]  They tried several times to pass different acts.
[03:50:10.414 --> 03:50:12.955]  They had ACTA, PIPA, they had CISPA.
[03:50:12.955 --> 03:50:18.718]  Several different times they went through, they took off the P in CISPA, and now it is now CISA.
[03:50:19.338 --> 03:50:20.579]  Exactly the same thing.
[03:50:20.579 --> 03:50:21.780]  The P was about protection.
[03:50:21.780 --> 03:50:23.181]  And what were they doing with protection?
[03:50:23.181 --> 03:50:24.843]  They haven't removed the protection.
[03:50:24.843 --> 03:50:34.691]  The whole point of CISPA and the whole point of CISA, which has now passed, is to remove legal liability from people who snitch on you.
[03:50:34.691 --> 03:50:35.652]  Corporations who do that.
[03:50:35.652 --> 03:50:37.734]  They want to actively encourage that.
[03:50:37.734 --> 03:50:42.858]  Now they want to actively encourage all medical professionals to snitch on you.
[03:50:43.579 --> 03:50:46.641]  You have to look at this as not about gun confiscation.
[03:50:46.641 --> 03:50:49.522]  This is about privacy confiscation.
[03:50:49.522 --> 03:50:51.863]  It's about confiscating your consent.
[03:50:51.863 --> 03:50:53.724]  And they're also coming after the baby boomers.
[03:50:53.724 --> 03:50:55.465]  This is gun control for baby boomers.
[03:50:55.465 --> 03:50:56.106]  We'll be right back.
[03:50:56.106 --> 03:50:56.526]  Stay with us.
[03:50:59.946 --> 03:51:08.668]  My name is Don Whiskin, and at 42 years old, I suffered a massive heart attack and was told I'd be on disability for the rest of my life.
[03:51:08.668 --> 03:51:10.128]  What did I do?
[03:51:10.128 --> 03:51:18.070]  I created ExtendoVite, a garlic and cayenne mix of seven herbs which rebuilt my heart and gave me back my life.
[03:51:18.070 --> 03:51:26.492]  For over 17 years now, I have made this formula available to you, so you don't have to suffer the same thing I did.
[03:51:27.032 --> 03:51:32.215]  Clean your blocked arteries and strengthen your heart and boost your natural immune system.
[03:51:32.215 --> 03:51:35.877]  I'm 60 years old now and I still work every day.
[03:51:35.877 --> 03:51:37.758]  To get your Xtendivite, call 1-877-928-8822.
[03:51:37.758 --> 03:51:38.759]  That's 1-877-928-8822 or visit heartdrop.com.
[03:51:38.759 --> 03:51:41.781]  Xtendivite is only $69.95 for a 2-month supply of either capsules or liquid.
[03:51:59.429 --> 03:52:02.152]  The following statements have not been evaluated by the FDA.
[03:52:02.152 --> 03:52:05.636]  This product is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease.
[03:52:06.849 --> 03:52:10.331]  Something shocking just happened in a Coast Guard unit in San Diego.
[03:52:10.331 --> 03:52:15.773]  The old guys in the unit have turned the tables and are now destroying the young bucks in head-to-head fitness tests.
[03:52:15.773 --> 03:52:17.254]  How is this even possible?
[03:52:17.254 --> 03:52:24.797]  Turns out, the old guys in this unit have been part of a special test group for a doctor-formulated fountain of youth drink called Patriot Power Greens.
[03:52:24.797 --> 03:52:32.440]  Patriot Power Greens has been so effective for many of the older soldiers that it's made their achy joints, stiff muscles, and lack of energy a thing of the past.
[03:52:32.440 --> 03:52:35.662]  Previously, this drink was only available to elite military units.
[03:52:35.922 --> 03:52:43.750]  But for a limited time, the creator of Patriot Power Greens has set aside a small number of free samples specifically for our conservative friends.
[03:52:43.750 --> 03:52:46.913]  All they ask is that you chip in a few bucks to cover shipping.
[03:52:46.913 --> 03:52:51.038]  To claim your free samples of Patriot Power Greens, go to Greens75.com.
[03:52:51.038 --> 03:52:51.738]  That's Greens75.com.
[03:52:51.738 --> 03:52:52.139]  Greens75.com.
[03:52:58.351 --> 03:52:59.592]  You pick up the receiver.
[03:52:59.592 --> 03:53:06.519]  With your heart racing and sweat dripping from your forehead, you finally muster the courage to dial the number to call into your favorite talk radio show.
[03:53:06.519 --> 03:53:09.862]  It rings once, twice, and then... Hello, it's GCN.
[03:53:09.862 --> 03:53:11.544]  What's your name and the state you're calling from?
[03:53:11.544 --> 03:53:14.967]  Surprised you got through, you squeak out... Jason from Minnesota?
[03:53:14.967 --> 03:53:15.588]  Please hold.
[03:53:15.588 --> 03:53:22.515]  As you patiently wait for your turn, you begin to date me about being a famous talk radio host and what it would be like to have your own show.
[03:53:22.875 --> 03:53:24.657]  Jason from Minnesota, you're up!
[03:53:24.657 --> 03:53:28.420]  Millions of loyal listeners worldwide, waiting to call and talk to you.
[03:53:28.420 --> 03:53:29.701]  What color are you there?
[03:53:29.701 --> 03:53:33.605]  Cheering crowds surround you, calling out your name.
[03:53:33.605 --> 03:53:34.186]  Jason!
[03:53:34.186 --> 03:53:34.866]  Jason!
[03:53:34.866 --> 03:53:36.027]  Going once.
[03:53:36.027 --> 03:53:36.788]  Twice.
[03:53:36.788 --> 03:53:38.850]  Okay, we gotta move on to the next caller.
[03:53:38.850 --> 03:53:39.711]  You blew it.
[03:53:39.711 --> 03:53:39.891]  Huh?
[03:53:39.891 --> 03:53:40.131]  Wait, no!

[03:54:08.248 --> 03:54:09.549]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:54:09.549 --> 03:54:11.551]  I'm David Knight and I'm here with Jakari Jackson.
[03:54:11.551 --> 03:54:15.415]  We're going through the Obama dictates about guns.
[03:54:15.415 --> 03:54:17.517]  We've got one more section we're going to cover here.
[03:54:17.517 --> 03:54:23.042]  Before we do, I just want to remind you that we have extended the special 15% off through the end of this week.
[03:54:24.944 --> 03:54:27.127]  Everything at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:54:27.127 --> 03:54:31.212]  That's not only our health products, but things like the Hillary for Prison t-shirt.
[03:54:31.212 --> 03:54:34.736]  Things like the InfoWars solar base station power supply.
[03:54:34.736 --> 03:54:38.821]  That's a huge discount off of that large ticket item.
[03:54:38.821 --> 03:54:40.844]  And again, that is something that is... has a...
[03:54:41.064 --> 03:54:42.125]  Excellent battery in it.
[03:54:42.125 --> 03:54:47.847]  It's a solar power collector as well as a battery and a converter to power your devices.
[03:54:47.847 --> 03:54:51.829]  1,500 watts of continuous power, 3,000 watts of peak power.
[03:54:51.829 --> 03:54:55.671]  It will last up to eight times longer than a typical battery unit.
[03:54:55.671 --> 03:55:02.875]  It's a lithium iron phosphate battery and that's where you separate the quality of these solar power supplies.
[03:55:03.115 --> 03:55:07.176]  Again, 15% off everything at the InfoWars store.
[03:55:07.176 --> 03:55:08.997]  Use the promo code 2016.
[03:55:08.997 --> 03:55:11.338]  That's going to run through this Friday.
[03:55:11.338 --> 03:55:17.860]  Thank you so much for supporting us, and that is our thanks to you to extend this discount.
[03:55:17.860 --> 03:55:21.621]  Now, Jakar, as we were talking just before we went to break, they're going to
[03:55:22.503 --> 03:55:24.124]  Essentially come after our privacy.
[03:55:24.124 --> 03:55:26.066]  They're going to come after our consent.
[03:55:26.066 --> 03:55:39.076]  In the 1993 Brady Law, it prohibited gun ownership by individuals who had been involuntarily committed, who had been found incompetent to stand trial, who were deemed by court to be dangerous to themselves or others, that type of thing.
[03:55:39.076 --> 03:55:46.903]  But it prohibited doctors and other health care providers from violating the confidentiality of doctor-patient relationships.
[03:55:47.563 --> 03:55:49.304]  Nothing is confidential anymore.
[03:55:49.304 --> 03:55:54.866]  They have absolutely nothing but contempt for our consent, contempt for our privacy.
[03:55:54.866 --> 03:55:56.547]  And that's what we see now in this new law.
[03:55:56.547 --> 03:56:10.194]  Just like they did with the CISPA Act, they encouraged corporations that are dealing with your information online, like Google or whatever, any corporation that has that, they say, don't worry, we're going to protect you from liability when you violate somebody's privacy.
[03:56:10.194 --> 03:56:13.035]  We're going to say, well, you're just turning over your information.
[03:56:13.035 --> 03:56:15.096]  You're not turning over Jakari's information.
[03:56:15.196 --> 03:56:17.937]  Okay, he gave you consent to collect that, so it belongs to you.
[03:56:17.937 --> 03:56:19.098]  We don't need a search warrant for it.
[03:56:19.098 --> 03:56:21.859]  And they can't sue you if you give us information on that.
[03:56:21.859 --> 03:56:22.899]  So be a snitch.
[03:56:22.899 --> 03:56:25.680]  Yes, and we have the article from Kit Daniels today.
[03:56:25.680 --> 03:56:29.382]  Americans critical of the government can use their gun rights due to executive order.
[03:56:29.382 --> 03:56:31.423]  And this is exactly what you're talking about, David.
[03:56:31.423 --> 03:56:35.524]  If you go to see your health care professional, and maybe you're just talking, maybe you fell off your bike, right?
[03:56:35.524 --> 03:56:36.445]  You hurt your leg.
[03:56:36.445 --> 03:56:38.226]  And they just ask you, what do you think about the government?
[03:56:38.226 --> 03:56:40.366]  You say, well, I don't like the NSA spying on me.
[03:56:40.366 --> 03:56:42.627]  Well, that's oppositional defiant disorder.
[03:56:42.627 --> 03:56:43.768]  And by the DSM,
[03:56:44.168 --> 03:56:46.549]  They say that that is a mental disorder.
[03:56:46.549 --> 03:56:48.409]  I've got that in spades.
[03:56:48.409 --> 03:56:54.191]  I haven't been to a psychologist and been officially diagnosed with ODD.
[03:56:54.191 --> 03:56:58.153]  And you know they crafted that acronym to call us odd, right?
[03:56:58.153 --> 03:57:01.614]  But it's anybody who doesn't like out-of-control authority.
[03:57:02.114 --> 03:57:02.835]  Okay.
[03:57:02.835 --> 03:57:09.020]  Or, I guess you should say, what I don't like are people who act as if they have authority when they don't have authority.
[03:57:09.020 --> 03:57:13.124]  And that's what we're seeing here with these gun control edicts from Obama.
[03:57:13.124 --> 03:57:16.226]  He has gone beyond the authority that he has.
[03:57:16.226 --> 03:57:18.889]  I mean, the king of this country, let's put it this way, the king of this country,
[03:57:19.509 --> 03:57:20.970]  is the Constitution.
[03:57:20.970 --> 03:57:23.673]  Lex Rex, okay, is the Latin phrase for that.
[03:57:23.673 --> 03:57:27.576]  These guys are nothing but temporary stewards, but they're acting as if they're the kings.
[03:57:27.576 --> 03:57:28.977]  They're acting as if they're dictators.
[03:57:28.977 --> 03:57:34.622]  They can do anything that they want, and they have completely subverted the constitutional republic that we have here.
[03:57:34.622 --> 03:57:36.063]  But they're constitutional lawyers, David.
[03:57:36.063 --> 03:57:36.723]  They know how to interpret it.
[03:57:36.723 --> 03:57:38.144]  Yeah, he knows exactly what he's doing.
[03:57:38.144 --> 03:57:39.806]  That's right.
[03:57:39.806 --> 03:57:40.546]  He knows exactly.
[03:57:40.546 --> 03:57:44.290]  Now, Kit Daniels put up an article just now, came in and gave this to us.
[03:57:44.290 --> 03:57:46.351]  Obama bans himself from buying guns?
[03:57:47.532 --> 03:57:51.296]  Shrink had suggested that the president himself may be mentally ill.
[03:57:51.296 --> 03:57:57.542]  So all he needs is just one individual to flag him like that with an opinion, then he couldn't get guns.
[03:57:57.542 --> 03:57:59.284]  But he doesn't need guns, Jakari.
[03:57:59.284 --> 03:58:01.326]  He's got an army of people to protect him.
[03:58:01.326 --> 03:58:01.887]  He's got Secret Service.
[03:58:01.887 --> 03:58:02.647]  Yeah, that's right.
[03:58:02.647 --> 03:58:04.389]  It's kind of like, you know, the old mafia dons.
[03:58:04.389 --> 03:58:07.212]  They don't carry the gun because they got, you know, 20 guys standing behind them.
[03:58:07.352 --> 03:58:08.293]  That's right, yeah.
[03:58:08.293 --> 03:58:14.600]  So he doesn't need them, and he's not going to let you protect yourself from criminals or from the government if need be.
[03:58:14.600 --> 03:58:15.941]  So that's what this is all about.
[03:58:15.941 --> 03:58:16.722]  Thanks for joining us.
[03:58:16.722 --> 03:58:18.003]  That's the end of our broadcast.
[03:58:18.003 --> 03:58:21.567]  Join us again tonight for the InfoWars Nightly News, 7 Central, 8 p.m.
[03:58:21.567 --> 03:58:22.328]  Eastern.
